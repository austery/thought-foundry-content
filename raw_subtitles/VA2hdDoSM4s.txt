I've been competing in dog agility
since I was six years old,
so I've had a lot of time
to accept this hard truth.
I'm not the part of the team
that most people are concerned about.
They just want to meet my teammate.
So let's start with her.
High Five!
Good girl.
Sit.
Are you ready?
OK.
Rep, rep.
Tire.
Weave, weave.
Yes, good girl.
Weave, weave.
Tunnel, tunnel.
Loop, loop.
Tunnel, tunnel.
Weave.
Weave, weave, weave.
Get it, get it, get it, get it!
(Cheers and applause)
Dog agility started as a backyard hobby,
but it has evolved into a serious
global competition.
For many, including myself,
it's become a full-time career.
High Five is just one of many dogs
that I compete with.
I also have Surprise, her niece,
who is also a Border Collie,
Bee and Rio,
both Shetland Sheepdogs,
and my youngest
is Skittles, a mixed breed.
Like most pro athletes,
we train year round,
four to five days a week on average,
in a giant air-conditioned
arena with astroturf.
What you see here is a small version
of a full-size agility course.
At a proper competition,
you have 18 to 22 obstacles
on approximately 10 to 12,000
square-feet arena,
and the goal is to run
those obstacles in order,
making no mistakes
and faster than any of your competitors.
Sounds simple enough, right?
But there's a catch.
Every course is different.
In fact, the judge almost never
reuses the same course twice.
That means that there is
a possible 6.4 quadrillion
different courses available.
That's right, quadrillion.
And we don't know
until the day of the event
what the course is.
You, as the human,
get just eight minutes to study,
memorize and get ready
to run that course at full speed.
One mistake, just one,
and the win slips
right through your hands.
But sometimes the stars align
and it goes a bit like this.
(Video) Commentator:
The fastest dog in qualifying
in the 16-inch class,
the last dog to run,
can it overtake Madison
and be a champion here at Westminster?
Jennifer gets a good lead out
so she can do that front cross,
teeter, you stay on it, there we go,
through the tire.
Up and over this A-frame, touch,
beautiful, get into that tunnel.
I love she's saying "good good,"
she's rewarding her dog verbally,
it's awesome.
Boy, look at the speed over there.
Amazing dog walking.
See if it can stay clean.
There we go.
One last jump to go.
There it is, there it is.
There's your new winner.
(Applause)
JC: That's Bee and I
at the 2022 Westminster Kennel Club
Masters Agility Championship
held in New York City,
where she won the title
of Overall Masters Agility Champion,
the first Sheltie in the history
of the sport to do so.
(Applause)
Now often people think
that the hardest part about dog agility
is teaching them
how to jump through a hoop
or climb over a teeter-totter.
But that's not entirely true.
That part's actually easy.
The equipment specifications
are standardized,
so once we teach the dogs the equipment,
they know how to do the equipment.
Frankly, at the highest levels
of competition,
dogs rarely make mistakes.
So that means the difference between
winning and losing comes down to speed.
Just like F1, NASCAR or Olympic skiing,
the judges have to use laser sensors
and video playback
to determine the winner.
At last year's Agility World
Championship in Belgium,
they measured time
to the 1/100 of a second,
and yet there was still a tie
for the gold medal.
This means that the real challenge
is in this interspecies communication.
Building a system of signals,
timing and trust
so refined that the dogs
can run full-speed,
making decisions in milliseconds
based on nothing more than the information
the handler is providing.
This sport is about communication.
This sport is about connection.
And that's what I'm here
to share with you.
What dog agility can teach you
about communication.
In fact, learning how
to communicate with my dog
and not just to my dog
has been the most important
lesson of my career.
In the beginning, it seemed simple.
I would holler a command,
or I would point at an obstacle.
I would use my voice,
and I would use my hands.
After all, we're human,
that's how we communicate.
But that's not what's natural to the dog.
So if I want my dog to run with passion,
power and precision,
I have to learn her language.
In agility, we have six primary cues
that we can use
to communicate with the dog.
We have the hand signal
and the verbal, which I've mentioned,
but also shoulder position,
eye contact, motion and location.
As humans, we tend to default
to the hand signal and the voice,
but those are unnatural cues for the dog,
meaning those are not ones
that they're familiar with at birth.
The most natural cues
for them are motion, location,
shoulders and eye contact.
These are the ones that they're going
to understand even as puppies.
So if I take an eight-week-old puppy down
and I set them down
and I take off running,
that puppy chases me.
And if I stop, the puppy stops.
This is a motion-based communication.
It's very innate, it's very instinctual.
But if I take that same
eight-week-old puppy,
and I look at it
and I say “sit” or “stay,”
that puppy doesn't understand
what I'm talking about
unless those cues are already trained.
So imagine a scenario where
you're trying to run a dog at full speed
through a complex course,
using the signals and communication
that is the least natural to them.
That's very risky.
We don't want them to stop
and be checking in with us
and say, "Where are we going?
What does that cue mean?"
This is about speed, after all.
I often tell my students
that I could have laryngitis
and both arms in a sling,
and yet still I could run
an agility course.
Because I'm not relying
on their least-natural cues
of verbal and hand signal.
I want to focus on what my dog understands
the natural uses of motion.
So let me go ahead
and show you what I mean.
High Five!
Good girl.
So I'm going to run it
through this drill twice.
Hi. We're going to start
over here at the tire.
Come here.
Sit.
The first time I want you
to focus on what she's doing.
Good girl.
Tire, jump, tunnel.
Weave, weave.
Good girl.
Weave.
Take, good.
So what was she doing
and why was she doing it?
We're going to do it a second time.
And this time, I want you
to pay attention to what I'm doing
and how I'm communicating with her.
Hi, sit.
Good girl.
Tire, jump, tunnel, tunnel.
Weave, weave, weave.
Weave, take.
Good girl.
Good girl, alright, take a rest.
(Applause)
What I was looking for her to do
was run a straight line
at a very fast speed.
I wanted her to go down this line,
taking as few strides as possible.
I didn't want her checking in with me,
I didn't want her questioning
where we were going
and what we were doing.
So in order to communicate that to her,
I also kept my motion
running in that direction,
and I wanted my speed
to stay forward as well.
Now as I mentioned previously,
the judge often changes the course.
And as the levels get more difficult,
the traps and challenges get trickier.
So often a judge will place an obstacle
very obviously on the dog's line
in order to try to trick them
into what seems like the natural path.
So this time, what I'm going to do
is I'm going to go down
and start at the tire,
but we're not going to ask for the tunnel,
and I'm not going to holler her name
or scream anything frantic.
We're going to see
if she can watch my motion.
OK, let's come here.
Hi.
Sit.
Good girl.
Tire, jump, weave, weave, weave.
Yes, good girl, weave, weave.
Take.
There we go.
(Applause)
Come here, take a rest.
Good girl.
So what I wanted her to do
was turn after this jump
and make the turn back
to the weave poles,
not go straight ahead into the tunnel.
After all, the tunnel is the dog’s
favorite obstacle,
and it is what we just asked her to do.
So in order to cue that turn,
it was on me to change my handling
and my communication with her
in a way that she would understand.
As she was approaching this jump,
because I wanted her
to decelerate and turn,
I decelerated and turned.
If I wanted her to do
the same thing as before,
I would have kept doing
the same thing as before.
So our goal is in cuing very clearly
what it is that we want her to do.
She wants unambiguous communication,
very, very clear signals.
What we don't want to do is present
conflicting information.
So imagine a scenario
where my body says one thing
but my verbal say something else.
At the speeds the dogs are traveling,
they don't have time to stop and ask
for information about where to go.
They just have to make a choice,
and they're often going to go
with what is natural to them.
So I'm going to show you something
a little bit different on this one.
We're going to start
over here at the tunnel.
And now I'm going
to present conflicting cues.
So my body is going to tell her one thing
and my verbal is going
to tell her something else.
At the speed that she's going
she's going to default
to what is most natural to her.
OK, come here.
Hi.
Come here.
Sit.
Good girl.
Tunnel.
Jump.
Right, right, weave.
Good girl.
Good girl.
Yes, good job.
Get it.
OK, take a rest.
Good job.
As you could see on that one,
my body was telling her to go to the left,
but my verbal was telling her
to go to the right.
At the speed she was going,
she wasn't going to question
what the verbal was doing.
She was going to respond
to what was the most natural
means of communication for her,
and that was her motion.
This is how we train.
I record almost every
training session that we do,
and if there's any mistakes,
I go back and I watch that video.
Most of the time it was me.
A poor signal, a late command,
confusion on her part
because of something that I did.
She's like, yes, it's always you.
(Laughter)
So often when I'm teaching,
I will use driving metaphors
for my students.
So she's the driver,
she's in the driver's seat,
she's running the course.
I'm just the one navigating
and letting her know where to go.
So imagine we're going down the freeway,
70 miles an hour in the left-hand lane,
and I just go, "Oh, this is our exit."
You can't just be swerving
across and getting off.
It's my job to communicate to her
where we're going
and to do so in a timely manner.
But I also don't want to be so early
that she gets over in the right-hand lane
behind a line of semis,
and it costs us a bunch of time
getting off at the exit.
I know.
Agility is a team sport.
It's not a solo act.
It's all about communication.
It's all about connection.
The best runs are when
there's a real connection
between the dog and the handler.
It's not just about watching
her on course,
it's about actually
making eye contact with her.
It's why I will never be caught
running an agility course in sunglasses.
But the best teams are also
those who understand each other.
Knowing my teammate, knowing
their tendencies, their strengths,
their weaknesses, their fears,
allow me to meet her halfway.
They allow me to adjust and tailor
every training session to my dog.
As I tell my students,
train the dog you were given.
All of my dogs are a little bit different.
Surprise has no problem
doing the drills 100 times
over and over again at full speed.
High Five, on the other hand,
is a bit of a perfectionist.
If there's too many mistakes
or if I have to repeat things
too many times,
she starts to worry
that she's done it wrong.
She has to go slower.
So adjusting for what my dog needs
and how they communicate
allows me to build a relationship
where my dog does agility
because they want to,
not because they have to.
After all, I'm going to put them
in some pretty high-pressure situations,
and I want them
to be having a good time out there.
Good girl.
So you might be thinking,
this is fascinating,
but what does this have to do with me?
Agility has taught me
that communicating with dogs
isn't all that different
than communicating with humans.
You have to ask yourself
the same question,
whether it's raising a child,
leading a team at work,
or arguing with a spouse,
am I speaking their language?
Am I communicating in a clear way?
Am I being consistent?
Am I trying to understand them,
or am I just trying to control them?
Agility has also taught me
that the best communicators
aren’t necessarily those
that speak the loudest
or are the most commanding.
They are those who reach out
to have the best connection
and to be understood.
It doesn't matter if your teammate
is two-legged or four.
The best relationships are going to be
when they trust you enough
to run full-speed into the unknown,
knowing that you
will get them through safely
and not because you asked them to,
but because they want to.
That’s agility, and that’s
communication at its best.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Sit.
High Five.
Good girl.
