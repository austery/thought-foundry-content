All
 right,
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


your
 favorite
 podcast,
 the
 AllIn


podcast.
 Today
 we
 have
 a
 conspiracy


corner
 episode
 for
 you.
 We're
 going to


go
 over
 the
 9/11
 inside
 job.
 We're
 going


over
 flat
 earth,
 JFK
 assassination.
 It's


going
 to
 be
 all
 conspiracy
 all
 the
 time


after
 our
 amazing
 blockbuster
 episode


during
 Ski
 Week.
 We're
 going
 all


conspiracy
 here.
 Our
 guest
 today,
 Alex


Jones.


>> How
 many
 views
 did
 it
 get?
 Nine
 views.
 I


mean,
 it's
 tough
 when
 you
 have
 one
 out


of
 four
 besties.
 It
 doesn't
 Michael


Tracy
 is
 on
 standby.


>> Not
 true.
 I
 can
 carry
 an
 episode
 for
 at


least
 400,000
 views.


>> I
 mean,
 you
 might.
 You
 might.
 I
 like


your
 Hey,
 for
 people
 who
 don't
 know,


Jimoth
 has
 his
 own
 YouTube
 channel.
 He's


got
 his
 escape
 hatch
 for
 when
 this
 train


wreck
 burns
 to
 the
 ground.
 He
 started


his
 own
 YouTube
 channel.
 He's
 hedging


his
 bets.
 Freyberg's
 working
 on
 his
 solo


project.
 Everybody's
 doing
 solo
 project.


The
 band's
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 solo
 projects.


>> The
 Beatles
 are
 experimenting.
 The


Beatles.


>> They're
 experimenting.
 We
 had
 a
 little


Yokoono
 situation
 going
 on
 here.
 You


know
 what
 the
 number
 one
 topic
 for
 this


show
 was
 by
 the
 all-in
 AI
 bot
 sacks.


>> What's
 up?


>> The
 number
 one
 was
 Daario
 versus
 Hegs,


the
 uh
 Department
 of
 War
 versus


anthropic
 was
 the
 number
 one
 topic


selected
 by
 our
 AI
 bot
 as
 a
 programming


note
 for
 folks.
 That
 decision
 will
 be


made
 end
 of
 the
 day
 Friday
 when
 this


podcast
 comes
 out.
 So,
 we
 will
 talk


about
 it
 next
 week.
 But,
 let's
 get
 to


work.
 We've
 got
 a
 full
 docket.
 The


clawed
 kill
 list
 has
 expanded
 and
 an
 AI


fanfiction
 substack
 tanked
 your
 401k
 on


Monday.
 Let's
 get
 into
 it.
 Anthropics


generational
 run
 continues.
 They're
 now


three
 for
 three
 in
 tanking
 different


market
 sectors
 in
 February.


Congratulations.
 This
 is
 like
 they
 they


took
 the
 the
 mantle
 from
 Brad
 Gersonner


uh
 tanking
 the
 market.


>> The
 Enthropic
 list.


>> It
 is
 February
 3rd.
 Anthropic
 announces,


hey,
 we
 got
 a
 legal
 plugin
 for
 Claude


Co-work,
 Thompson
 Reuters,
 Lexus,
 Nexus,


Legal
 Zoom,
 all
 down
 at
 least
 10%
 since


February
 3rd.
 Then
 on
 February
 20th,


Claude
 Code
 Security
 is
 announced
 in
 a


limited
 research
 preview.
 Stocks
 tank


again.
 Crowd
 Strike,
 Cloud
 for
 Octa,
 all


down.
 Then
 February
 23rd,
 Anthropic


announces
 Claude
 can
 modernize
 Cobalt


databases.
 If
 you
 don't
 know
 Cobalt,


that's
 the
 like
 oldest
 coding
 language


in
 the
 world.
 That's
 where
 Sachs
 learned


code
 when
 he
 was
 in
 college
 in
 the
 70s.


It's
 used
 for
 banking,
 payroll,


government,


>> healthare.


>> Healthcare
 runs
 95%
 of
 ATMs
 in
 the
 US


and
 it
 powers
 social
 security
 payments.


85%
 of
 all
 coal
 code
 runs
 on
 IBM


machines.
 So
 IBM
 decided
 they
 would
 tank


13%
 on
 Monday,
 their
 worst
 day
 since


2000.
 31
 billion
 in
 market
 cap
 losses.


So
 let's
 stop
 here
 before
 I
 get
 into
 the


fanfiction
 piece.


What's
 your
 take
 here
 of
 what's


happening
 in
 the
 market,
 Shmath?
 Is
 this


simply
 people
 are
 looking
 for
 an
 excuse


to
 trim
 their
 positions
 because
 things


have
 been
 top
 ticking
 all-time
 highs
 and


people
 are
 just
 looking
 for
 an
 excuse
 or


is
 this
 reality?
 Is
 this
 the
 go
 forward


reality
 that
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 compress


these
 kind
 of
 stocks
 because
 it
 solves
 a


lot
 of
 problems?


>> I'm
 going
 to
 give
 you
 two
 explanations.


I
 don't
 know
 what
 percentage
 I
 would


allocate


across
 the
 two,
 but
 I
 think
 one
 is


tactical
 and
 one
 is
 much
 more
 strategic,


but
 I
 think
 both
 are
 happening.
 The


tactical
 one
 is
 that
 we
 are
 at
 a
 moment


in
 time
 where
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 smart
 money


hedge
 funds
 are
 starting
 to
 massively


degross.
 And
 what
 that
 means
 is
 they're


trimming
 a
 lot
 of
 positions
 and
 they're


just
 taking
 on
 a
 lot
 less
 risk.
 Why?
 I


don't
 exactly
 know.
 It
 could
 be


motivated
 by
 the
 second
 thing
 that
 I'm


going
 to
 talk
 about.
 But
 the
 point
 is
 in


a
 deg


risk
 and
 making
 your
 position
 sizes
 much


smaller.
 So
 the
 longs
 become
 less
 long,


the
 shorts
 become
 less
 short
 and
 you


just
 shrink.
 And
 so
 there's
 just
 general


downward
 pressure.
 That
 is
 a
 clear


behavior
 right
 now.
 But
 I
 think
 the


structural
 change
 is
 the
 more
 important


one.
 And
 this
 is
 sort
 of
 what
 I
 talked


about
 this
 morning.
 In
 a
 normal


functioning
 market,


what
 we
 are
 always
 debating
 is
 when
 a


set
 of
 cash
 flows
 go
 from
 becoming


highly
 confident
 to
 less
 highly


confident.
 It's
 a
 when
 conversation.
 So


when
 will
 Coca-Cola's
 cash
 flows
 be


impacted?
 When
 will
 Eli
 Lily's
 cash


flows
 be
 impacted?
 When
 will
 Meta's
 cash


flows
 be
 impacted?
 And
 the
 answer
 to
 the


when


gets
 translated
 by
 the
 public
 markets


into
 three
 things.
 Your
 price
 to


earnings
 multiple
 where
 if
 you
 invert


that
 number
 what
 that
 is
 equivalent
 to


is
 the
 yield
 on
 the
 money
 that
 you
 get.


Okay.
 So
 if
 you
 you
 know
 20
 times
 PE


that's
 a
 5%
 yield.


The
 second
 is
 a
 revenue
 multiple.
 And


the
 third
 is
 what's
 called
 your
 weighted


average
 cost
 of
 capital.
 Which
 is
 to


say,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 next
 20
 to
 30


years
 of
 earnings
 and
 you
 want
 to
 figure


out
 what
 that
 is
 worth
 today,


you
 have
 to
 discount
 all
 of
 these
 back


and
 you
 have
 to
 assume


a
 percentage
 of
 interest
 effectively


that
 it
 takes
 to
 get
 there.
 And
 the


basic
 math
 of
 this
 is
 that
 when
 you
 have


a
 high
 whack,
 it's
 called,
 you're


massively
 discounting
 these
 cash
 flows.


When
 you
 have
 a
 low
 whack,
 you're


assuming
 that
 these
 things
 are
 very


durable.
 Okay.
 So,
 what
 is
 happening?


We
 used
 to
 debate
 when
 this
 is
 no
 longer


a
 when
 moment.
 The
 market
 is
 very
 much


in
 an
 if
 mode.


Are
 these
 cash
 flows
 durable
 at
 all?


>> Could
 they
 fall
 off
 a
 cliff
 in
 year


three?
 Is
 there
 some
 AI
 model
 that's


going
 to
 come
 around
 the
 corner
 and


obliterate
 this
 business
 without
 me


knowing
 it?
 And
 because
 they've
 shifted


into
 this
 if
 mindset,


your
 risk
 becomes
 totally
 different.
 You


have
 this
 event
 risk
 that
 you
 don't
 know


how
 to
 price.
 And
 whenever
 the
 market


shifts
 into
 that
 mode,
 what
 you
 see
 are


that
 the
 holders
 of
 those
 equities
 want


a
 massive
 margin
 of
 safety.
 What
 does


that
 mean?
 They
 have
 to
 take
 pees
 way


down.
 If
 you
 used
 to
 trade
 at
 40,
 you


should
 trade
 at
 20.
 If
 you
 used
 to
 trade


at
 20,
 you
 should
 trade
 at
 10.


They
 take
 revenue
 multiples
 down.
 You


used
 to
 trade
 at
 10
 times
 revenue.
 Now


you're
 going to
 trade
 it
 three
 times.


You
 take
 the
 whack
 way
 up.
 Used
 to
 be
 a


6%
 discounted
 weighted
 average
 cost
 of


capital.
 You
 know
 what?
 I'm
 taking
 you


to
 12
 or
 13.
 That's
 the
 market's
 way
 of


saying,
 I'm
 now
 debating


if
 these
 things
 will
 even
 exist
 and
 so
 I


need
 to
 give
 myself
 a
 huge
 buffer
 to
 own


this
 stuff.


>> That's
 what's
 happening
 right
 now.
 It


has
 a
 lot
 of
 ripple
 effects
 that
 we
 can


talk
 about.
 Freeberg
 and
 I
 have
 talked


about
 this
 a
 lot.
 The
 most
 obvious


impact
 is
 how
 these
 tech
 companies


recruit
 and
 retain
 talent
 because
 the


biggest
 thing
 that
 it
 starts
 to
 eat
 into


are
 the
 cash
 flows
 of
 a
 business
 which


really
 directly
 tied
 to
 stockbased
 comp


and
 all
 this
 other
 stuff.
 But
 let
 me


just
 stop
 there.
 So
 we
 are
 we
 have
 moved


away
 from
 a
 when


>> to
 now
 an
 if
 and
 I
 think
 that
 that
 is
 a


very
 smart
 question
 to
 be
 asking.
 The


answer
 may
 be
 from
 any
 of
 these


companies
 that
 they
 will
 survive,
 but
 we


don't
 know
 how
 long.
 And
 until
 that


becomes
 clearer,
 you
 have
 to
 give


yourself
 room
 to
 be
 wrong.


>> You
 said
 when,
 then
 if.
 Did
 you
 mean
 if?


>> No,
 no,
 no.


>> To
 when?


>> We
 we've
 always
 debated
 when.
 When
 will


these
 cash
 flows
 disappear?
 Now
 it's


like


>> will
 they
 even
 exist?


>> Got
 it.
 Okay.
 So
 the
 second
 part
 of
 the


story
 Friedberg
 and
 Sachs
 is
 that
 a


Substack
 post
 fanfiction


uh
 taking
 place
 in
 the
 fictional
 2028
 uh


global
 intelligence
 crisis
 went
 mega


viral.
 28
 million
 views
 on
 X.
 It
 was


posted
 Sunday
 night.
 It
 made
 the
 market


tank
 on
 Monday.
 In
 this
 fictional


Substack
 post,
 the
 author
 said
 there's


going
 to
 be
 essentially
 a
 death
 spiral


that
 happens
 because
 of
 AI.
 How
 does


that
 work?
 Well,
 first,
 companies


embrace
 AI.
 Everything
 goes
 right.


They're
 able
 to
 cut
 staff.
 Their
 margins


go
 up,
 similar
 to
 how
 Amazon
 has,
 you


know,
 trimmed
 their
 white
 collar
 staff.


Then
 they're
 so
 successful
 at
 this
 that


they
 lose
 their
 customer
 base
 because


consumers
 don't
 have
 discretionary


funding
 to
 spend.
 Then
 it
 creates
 a


death
 spiral
 where
 the
 companies
 keep


deploying
 AI
 to
 try
 to
 hit
 the
 margins,


cutting
 staff,
 and
 the
 entire
 economy


collapses.
 Dr.
 Doom
 level
 stuff.


Unemployment's
 at
 10%,
 S&P
 goes
 down


from
 38%
 highs.
 After
 this
 piece
 came


out
 which
 speculated
 that
 agents
 would


get
 rid
 of
 all
 the
 3%
 interchange
 fees


and
 move
 everybody
 to
 settle


transactions
 on
 stable
 coins.
 All
 the


financial
 stocks
 got
 hit
 on
 Monday.
 Amex


down
 8%,
 Capital
 1
 down
 8%,
 Mastercard


6%,
 Visa
 4%,
 yada
 yada.
 Finally,
 this


piece
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 push
 back.
 There
 was


a
 silly
 piece
 in
 it
 or
 a
 section
 in
 it


where
 they
 said
 AI
 agents
 would
 vibe


code
 their
 way
 to
 displacing
 Door
 Dash.


And
 uh
 that's
 kind
 of
 silly
 if
 anybody's


run
 a
 networkbased
 business
 knows.
 Sax,


I
 assume
 you
 read
 this
 piece
 or
 at least


saw
 the
 fallout
 from
 it.
 What's
 your


take?
 And
 then
 we'll
 go to
 you
 Freeberg.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 I
 know
 that
 this
 uh


Catrini
 article
 got
 passed
 around
 like
 a


join
 at
 a
 Grateful
 Dead
 concert,
 but
 I'm


starting
 to
 question
 how
 legitimately


viral
 it
 really
 was.
 There's
 some


information
 that
 just
 came
 out
 that
 the


attribution
 of
 the
 article
 has
 been


amended,
 meaning
 the
 co-authors
 have


been
 amended
 to
 include
 a
 short
 fund


that
 was
 shorting
 some
 of
 the
 names


mentioned
 in
 the
 article.
 This
 is


according
 to
 another
 post
 that
 just
 came


out.
 According
 to
 this
 post,
 the


authorship
 attribution
 attributed
 to


market
 moving
 was
 changed
 after


publication
 of
 the
 co-author
 is
 the


managing
 partner
 of
 a
 $262
 million
 SEC


registered
 hedge
 fund
 who
 confirmed


short
 positions
 in
 the
 companies
 the


report
 named.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 point


number
 one
 is
 I
 just
 wonder
 did
 this


article
 truly
 go
 viral
 or
 did
 the


authors
 do
 anything
 to
 kind
 of
 amplify


it
 and
 we
 just
 don't
 know
 the
 answer
 to


that
 question.
 But
 regardless
 of
 that,


let's
 just
 take
 the
 arguments
 on
 their


face.
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 best
 responses


to
 it
 was
 by
 another
 writer
 named
 Derek


Thompson
 who
 wrote
 a
 article
 called


Nobody
 Knows
 Anything,
 which
 I
 think
 is


a
 reference
 to
 a
 famous
 take
 by


legendary
 Hollywood
 writer
 William


Goldman.


>> Yeah.


>> In
 any
 event,
 what
 the
 article
 says
 is


no
 one
 really
 knows
 what's
 going
 to


happen
 with
 AI
 in
 two
 years,
 never
 mind


20
 years.
 And
 so
 they
 resort
 to
 science


fiction
 writing
 masquerading
 as


analysis.
 And
 the
 author
 here,
 Derek


Thompson,
 says
 that
 the
 conversation


about
 AI
 is
 really
 just
 a
 marketplace
 of


competing
 science
 fiction
 narratives.


And
 he
 says,
 "That's
 not
 to
 say
 I
 think


the
 technology
 is
 a
 parlor
 trick,
 but


rather
 that
 the
 level
 of
 uncertainty
 is


so
 high
 and
 the
 quality
 and
 supply
 of


real
 world
 real-time
 information
 about


AI's
 macroeconomic
 effects
 so
 poultry


that
 very
 serious
 conversations
 about
 AI


are
 often
 more
 literary
 than
 genuinely


analytical."
 So
 in
 other
 words,
 what


he's
 saying
 is,
 look,
 this
 guy
 is


writing
 very
 compelling
 science
 fiction,


but
 there's
 no
 real
 analytics
 behind
 it


to
 defend
 it.
 And
 yes,
 this
 could


happen.
 Here's
 a
 prediction
 market
 on


whether
 people
 believe
 the
 Catrini


report's
 going
 to
 come
 true.
 Something


like
 12%
 believe
 the
 Catrini
 scenario
 is


going
 to
 happen.
 But
 the
 truth
 is,
 no


one
 really
 knows.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 other


dueling
 science
 fiction
 narratives
 where


AI
 is
 going
 to
 create
 such
 a
 world
 of


abundance
 that
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 need


for
 anything.
 And
 just
 by
 the
 way,
 Derek


Thompson
 is
 one
 of
 the
 abundance
 guys


with
 Ezra
 Klein.


>> This
 is
 why
 the
 market's
 getting


whacked.
 I
 think
 that
 you're
 right,


Saxs,
 nobody
 knows.
 So,
 if
 you
 can
 get


5%
 for
 owning
 government
 bonds,
 why
 are


we
 taking
 excessive
 risk
 here?


>> Yeah.
 Let
 me
 just
 build
 on
 your
 point


about
 SAS.
 So
 the
 reason
 why
 there's
 so


much
 uncertainty
 around
 SAS
 is
 that
 SAS


used
 to
 be
 such
 a
 easily
 modeled
 and


predictable
 category
 and
 you
 know
 I
 saw


as
 a
 VC
 we
 saw
 the
 same
 story
 play
 out


across
 many
 many
 different
 categories
 of


software.
 You'd
 have
 this
 initial
 period


where
 there'd
 be
 this
 experimentation


phase
 you
 have
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


products
 that
 come
 to
 market.
 There'd
 be


a
 battle
 and
 then
 the
 market
 would


eventually
 settle
 and
 they'd
 be
 a


category
 leader
 and
 they
 would
 capture


most
 of the
 market
 share
 and
 the
 vast


majority
 of
 the
 market
 capitalization


and
 they
 would
 have
 very
 very


predictable
 metrics.
 It
 was
 very
 easy
 to


grade
 a
 SAS
 business.
 You
 look
 at
 ARR,


you
 say
 annually
 recurring
 revenue.
 You


look
 at
 the
 net
 dollar
 retention
 you


want
 to
 see
 depending
 on
 the
 phase


>> RPO
 RPO
 revenue
 under
 performance.


>> And
 so
 you
 know
 these
 things
 began
 to
 be


seen
 as
 like
 a
 annuity
 with
 growth
 right


because


>> they
 were
 rock
 solid.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Because
 a
 good
 net
 dollar


retention
 would
 be
 something
 like
 120%.


Which
 means
 that
 your
 sort
 of
 cohort
 of


existing
 customers
 on
 balance
 would
 all


renew
 the
 next
 year
 and
 actually
 they


would
 renew
 at
 120%
 of
 the
 previous


year's
 contract
 values.
 And
 the
 reason


you
 got
 that
 extra
 20%
 is
 they
 would
 buy


more
 seats
 or
 there'd
 be
 additional


products
 or
 features
 they
 would
 upsell.


It
 got
 to
 be
 very
 very
 predictable.
 And


so
 when
 people
 were
 buying
 software


companies
 at
 I
 don't
 know
 13
 times
 ARR,


they
 thought
 they
 were
 buying
 a
 growth


annuity.
 And
 now
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 you
 got


to
 factor
 into
 that.
 Well,
 wait
 a


second.
 What
 if
 AI
 disrupts
 the
 whole


market?
 What
 if
 it
 doesn't
 eliminate?
 I


don't
 think
 AI
 is
 going to
 get
 rid
 of


Salesforce,
 but
 it
 could
 eat
 into
 their


growth
 opportunity.
 We
 just
 don't
 know


what
 if
 it
 changes
 the
 pricing
 model.
 I


mean,
 it
 just
 creates
 a
 whole
 lot
 of


unknowns.
 And
 I
 I
 actually
 don't
 believe


in
 the
 Catrini
 or
 or
 the
 doomer
 take
 on


this,
 but
 I
 can
 see
 why
 the
 market
 would


feel
 this
 level
 of
 uncertainty


>> 100%.


>> Given
 how
 predictable
 a
 category
 SAS


used
 to
 be
 just
 say
 a
 year
 ago.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 chaos
 is
 a
 ladder,
 Freeberg,


and
 this
 means
 opportunity.
 So,
 if
 we


look
 at
 this
 and
 SAS
 has
 headwinds,
 then


is
 there
 a
 winner?
 Is
 open
 source
 the


winner?
 Or
 is
 this
 all
 deflationary
 in


your
 mind,
 Freeberg?
 And
 we
 just
 make


less
 money
 and
 the
 earnings
 of
 these


companies
 get
 compressed,
 the
 size
 of


them
 gets
 compressed.
 How
 do
 you
 think


about
 it?
 I
 think
 fundamentally
 if


you're
 driving
 productivity
 with
 AI,


you're
 driving
 leverage
 on
 human
 time


and
 leverage
 on
 capital.


The
 question
 is
 how
 quickly
 can
 you


drive
 that
 up?
 And
 that's
 a
 function
 of


how
 much
 consumption
 there
 is,
 how
 much


capacity
 there
 is
 for
 consumption.
 So
 on


the
 one
 hand,
 I'll
 just
 speak
 broadly.
 I


think
 like
 humans
 have
 this
 desire
 to


improve
 their
 livelihoods
 by
 roughly
 10%


every
 year.
 Meaning
 like
 your
 income
 and


your
 ability
 to
 purchase
 stuff
 that's


new
 relative
 to
 where
 you
 were
 last
 year


has
 to
 go
 up
 by
 10%
 for
 you
 to
 be
 happy.


If
 it's
 less
 than
 10%,
 you're
 probably


unhappy.


>> Is
 that
 that's
 your
 anecdote
 or
 that's


like


>> that's
 just
 like
 an
 anecdote.
 Like
 I


think
 I
 think
 that's
 sort
 of
 like
 my


rubric
 for
 thinking
 about
 like
 why
 are


people
 unhappy?
 You're
 happy.
 So
 if
 your


earnings
 are
 the
 same
 but
 things
 are


getting
 more
 expensive,
 you're
 not


happy.
 If
 your
 earnings
 go
 up
 by
 10%
 and


things
 stay
 the
 same
 price,
 you
 got
 10%


more
 than
 you
 had
 last
 year.
 You're


you're
 going
 to
 be
 happy.
 I
 just
 think


like
 all
 humans
 are
 driven
 by
 this
 need


to
 consume
 more
 each
 year
 than
 they
 did


last
 year.
 So
 I
 think
 for
 me
 that's
 like


the
 lower
 limit
 on
 consumptive
 capacity


in
 the
 world.


The
 question
 that
 we're
 now
 facing
 which


we've
 never
 faced
 in
 human
 history


before
 is
 there
 a
 upper
 limit


>> on
 consumptive
 capacity
 because
 AI


creates
 such
 a
 profound
 shift
 in


productivity
 and
 in
 leverage
 that


normally
 you
 would
 say
 hey
 when
 we
 get
 a


new
 tool
 or
 we
 get
 new
 leverage
 in
 a


system
 we
 build
 a
 new
 technology
 we
 can


make
 more
 with
 less.
 Therefore,
 everyone


gets
 access
 to
 more
 things
 for
 the
 same


price
 or
 the
 cost
 of
 things
 that
 they


consume
 come
 down
 by
 a
 certain
 price.


But
 there
 may
 be
 a
 situation
 now
 where


the
 ability
 to
 make
 stuff
 exceeds
 the


capacity
 to
 consume
 stuff.
 And
 that
 is


something
 that
 I
 don't
 think
 we've
 faced


before.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 sort
 of
 where


a
 lot
 of the
 models
 start
 to
 break.
 Just


general
 economic
 models,
 just
 general


productivity
 models,
 and
 general
 social


models.
 And
 this
 goes
 to
 the
 point
 about


like
 what
 is
 everyone
 going
 to
 do?
 In


the
 same
 way
 that
 I
 think
 we've
 argued


that
 maybe
 SAS
 was
 a
 transitory
 business


phenomenon
 that
 existed
 between
 the


foundation
 of
 the
 internet
 and
 the
 era


of
 AI.
 It
 may
 be
 the
 case
 that
 knowledge


work
 in
 general
 is
 also
 a
 transitory


phenomenon
 that
 only
 existed
 between
 the


foundation
 of
 the
 computer
 or
 computing


tools
 and
 the
 existence
 of
 AI
 generally


speaking.
 And
 if
 all
 of
 that
 goes
 away


very
 quickly
 and
 all
 of
 those
 people
 can


be
 redistributed
 and
 recast
 into
 doing


other
 higher
 level,
 more
 creative


things,
 their
 productivity
 goes
 up
 by


100x.


Is
 there
 really
 a
 consumer
 on
 the
 other


end
 of
 all
 of
 that
 productivity?
 Is


there
 really
 enough
 consumptive


capacity?
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 the


profound
 question
 that
 we
 all
 face.
 I


don't
 think
 that
 there's
 any
 limit.


>> Is
 that
 your
 way
 of
 saying
 that
 SAS
 goes


to
 zero
 or
 that's
 your
 way
 of
 saying


these
 companies
 go
 to
 zero?
 I'm
 just


saying
 knowledge
 work
 in
 general
 like


the
 the
 like
 what
 is
 the
 implication


>> is
 this
 just
 another
 dueling
 science


fiction
 take
 I
 mean
 or
 what's
 your


evidence
 for
 this


>> I
 think
 it's
 fine
 to
 have
 a
 sci-fi
 take


intuition
 I
 think
 is
 data
 because
 I
 can


show
 you
 some
 data
 that
 I
 think


contradicts
 what
 you're
 saying


>> and
 I
 have
 some
 firstirhand
 sort
 of


>> in
 the
 sense
 that
 there's
 more
 leverage


stacks
 that
 people
 are
 able
 to
 actually


>> well
 Jake
 I
 want
 to
 hear
 what
 you
 have


to
 say
 because
 I
 know
 you're


experimenting
 with
 this
 but
 let
 me
 just


show
 you
 a
 few
 data
 points
 real
 quick
 um


because
 I
 think
 this
 is
 relevant.
 So


we're
 really
 talking
 about
 the


disruption
 caused
 by
 coding
 assistance,


right?
 This
 is
 like
 the
 first
 big
 killer


app
 of
 AI.
 I
 mean
 I
 guess
 after
 writing


and
 research
 for
 chat
 bots
 and
 we'll


have
 agents
 later,
 but
 really
 it's
 all


about
 coding
 assistance,
 right?
 And
 the


ability
 to
 more
 easily
 create
 code.


That's
 what's
 creating
 the
 disruption
 to


the
 SAS
 category.
 Well,
 so
 let's
 just


focus
 on
 the
 data
 we
 see
 right
 now


around
 that.
 And
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of


people
 who
 are
 pointing
 this
 out
 that


Enthropic
 right
 now
 has
 a
 job
 listing


for
 a
 software
 engineer
 on
 their
 website


right
 now
 for
 $570,000.


And
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 kind
 of
 pointing


out,
 okay,
 so
 wait,
 so
 what
 Anthropic
 is


saying
 is
 they're
 still
 trying
 to
 hire


software
 engineers
 at
 a
 very
 high
 wage,


but
 somehow
 they
 think
 these
 jobs
 are


going
 to
 be
 eliminated.


>> Timoth
 might
 apply
 for
 that
 job.
 is.


>> Yeah.
 Austerity
 measures
 sounds
 pretty


good
 to
 me.


>> That's
 a
 lot
 of
 money.


>> Jim
 might
 take
 that
 job
 and
 then
 just


have
 AI
 do
 it
 for
 him.


>> No,
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 worried
 like
 I
 hope
 my


8090
 team
 doesn't
 see
 that
 offer.
 That's


a


>> that's
 a
 big
 number.


>> Our
 equity
 is
 way
 higher,
 but
 our


salaries
 are
 not
 that
 high.
 I
 mean,
 you


look
 you
 put
 these
 things
 together,
 it's


like
 that
 equity
 is
 money
 good.
 The


reality
 is
 like
 those
 guys
 are
 doing
 5


to6
 billion
 structured
 secondaries
 every


year
 now
 or
 they're
 starting
 which
 means


that
 they
 will.
 That's
 like
 cash


compensation.
 So
 for
 for
 me
 to
 match


that,
 I
 need
 to
 be
 3x
 higher
 than
 that.


>> Right?
 And
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


kind
 of
 pointing
 out,
 well,
 this
 is
 a


contradiction.
 Anthropic
 doesn't
 really


seem
 to
 be
 practicing
 what
 they're


preaching
 if
 they're
 paying
 enormous


amounts
 still
 for
 software
 engineers


even
 as
 they
 claim
 they're
 obsoleting


the
 entire
 category.
 Something
 doesn't


quite
 add
 up.
 Citadel
 Securities
 did
 a


new
 report
 that
 rebutts
 that
 Catrini


report
 and
 they
 show
 a
 couple
 of
 stats


here
 which
 I
 think
 are
 really


interesting.
 So,
 job
 postings
 for


software
 engineers
 are
 rapidly
 rising.


They're
 showing,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 roughly


a
 10%
 year-over-year
 increase
 in
 the


demand
 for
 software
 engineers.
 On
 a


related
 note,
 they
 also
 show
 that


company
 formation
 is
 also
 rapidly


expanding
 and
 that
 may
 have
 something
 to


do
 with
 AI
 making
 it
 easier
 to
 start
 a


business
 or
 to
 get
 leverage
 to
 your


point,
 Freeberg.
 So
 look,
 there's
 a


couple
 of
 competing
 effects
 going
 on


here.
 And
 I
 think
 Aaron
 Levy
 had
 a


really
 good
 explanation
 of
 why
 you
 might


see
 something
 very
 counterintuitive


happening.
 And
 again,
 it
 all
 goes
 back


to
 Jeban's
 paradox.
 But
 what
 Aaron
 says


is
 that
 when
 you
 lower
 the
 cost
 of


something
 that
 was
 previously
 supply


constrained,
 demand
 for
 that
 thing
 goes


up.
 Software
 engineering
 is
 just
 one
 of


the
 easiest
 examples
 to
 contemplate,
 but


there
 are
 going
 to
 be
 many
 other
 jobs


like
 that.
 But
 think
 about
 software


engineering.
 Even
 among
 startups
 in


Silicon
 Valley,
 which
 I
 think
 are


probably
 some
 of
 the
 most
 attractive


places
 for
 software
 engineers
 to
 work,


there's
 always
 been
 a
 chronic
 shortage


of
 them.
 Then
 you've
 got
 the
 Fortune
 500


companies,
 non-
 tech
 companies,
 which


have
 always
 had
 an
 even
 harder
 time


hiring
 technical
 talent.
 So,
 you
 have


this
 massive
 unfilled
 need
 for
 software


engineers
 across
 the
 entire
 economy.


Now,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 a


lot
 more
 leverage
 out
 of
 software


engineers.
 It
 doesn't
 mean
 they're
 going


to
 get
 fired.
 It
 just
 means
 that
 now


maybe
 you
 can
 have
 a
 lot
 more
 10x


software
 engineers
 and
 they're
 getting


those
 jobs
 are
 now
 being
 spread


throughout
 the
 whole
 economy.
 You
 know,


I
 also
 think
 just
 to
 put
 some
 numbers
 on


this,
 I
 think
 the
 cost
 structure
 of
 the


average
 Fortune
 500
 business
 is


something
 like
 5%
 it
 includes
 all
 of


their
 IT,
 not
 just
 their
 software.
 You


know,
 what
 should
 it
 be?
 What
 should
 the


percentage
 of
 software
 be
 in
 an


enterprise
 cost
 structure?
 Elon


describes
 companies
 as
 cybernetic


organisms
 that
 are
 part
 software,
 part


human.


>> If
 you
 think
 about
 the
 current
 Fortune


500
 company
 being
 one
 or
 two
 percent


software,
 maybe
 they
 should
 be
 50%


software.
 I
 think
 what
 Aaron
 is
 saying


here
 is
 the
 market
 for
 software
 and


software
 engineers
 was
 so
 constrained
 by


the
 lack
 of
 availability


that
 even
 if
 we
 10x
 or
 100x
 the


productivity
 of
 software
 engineers,
 the


demand
 will
 be
 there
 to
 absorb
 this
 new


supply.
 And
 so
 it
 could
 lead
 to
 this


explosion
 in
 productivity
 without
 the


massive
 job
 loss.


>> I
 think
 you're
 right.
 I
 think
 the
 the


thing
 that
 I
 would
 look
 at
 is
 I
 would


expect
 OPEX
 as
 a
 percentage
 of
 revenue


to
 fall
 off
 of
 a
 cliff
 but
 within
 that


opex
 the
 percentage
 of
 it
 that
 you


allocate
 to
 technology
 and
 technology


related
 things
 probably
 goes
 way
 way
 up


than
 what
 it
 is
 today.
 Okay,
 Jason,
 the


batch
 of
 people
 that
 are
 applying
 for


launch,


has
 SAS
 stopped?
 Has
 software
 stopped?


>> It's
 AI
 first
 companies
 obviously
 and


people


>> are
 they
 rebuilding
 traditional
 SAS


tools
 just
 cheaper?


>> Basically,
 everybody's
 building
 the


great,
 you
 know,
 as
 we
 talked
 about
 at


the
 all-in
 summit
 like
 some
 of
 these


companies
 are
 trying
 to
 build
 the
 best


pilot
 in
 the
 world
 or
 Whimo's
 trying
 to


build
 the
 best
 driver
 in
 the
 world.


People
 are
 now
 trying
 to
 build
 the
 best


SDR
 in
 the
 world,
 the
 best
 salesperson,


the
 best
 executive
 coach.
 And
 so
 we
 have


been
 like
 obsessed
 with
 claude
 co-work,


but
 mainly
 OpenClaw.
 And
 so
 what
 we
 did


was
 and
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 not
 developers


that
 are
 going
 to
 do
 all
 this
 work,
 it's


knowledge
 workers.
 So
 we
 had
 we
 have
 20


people
 in
 our
 firm.
 We
 had
 15
 of
 them


come
 in
 this
 weekend
 and
 they
 all
 got


trained
 over
 like
 six
 or
 seven
 hours
 had


to
 have
 their
 own
 openclaw
 agent
 and
 we


started
 building
 it.
 Every
 piece
 of


software
 that
 we
 wanted
 to
 buy
 or
 build


over
 the
 last
 10
 years
 that
 we
 never
 got


to
 my
 people
 are
 building
 in
 the
 last
 30


days.
 As
 an
 example,
 you
 know,
 when


you're
 selling
 ads
 for
 a
 podcast,
 you


want
 to
 check
 all
 the
 other
 podcasts
 and


what
 advertisers
 they
 have.
 We
 trained


an
 agent
 to
 go
 take
 the
 top
 100


podcasts,
 look
 through
 the
 transcripts,


figure
 out
 who
 the
 advertisers
 are,


check
 those
 advertisers
 in
 pipe
 drive,


tell
 us
 when
 the
 last
 time
 we
 contacted


them
 and
 put
 it
 into
 the
 sales
 room.


That
 was
 an
 SDR
 job
 that
 we
 wanted
 to


fill
 and
 software
 we
 wanted
 to
 build.


Then
 we
 wanted
 people
 to
 have


>> hold
 on
 that
 was
 a
 that
 was
 a
 human
 that


you
 were
 paying
 money
 and
 now
 you've


replaced
 with
 software
 or
 that
 human


still
 exists
 but
 now
 they
 just
 do
 it
 in


a
 better
 way.


>> Redeploying
 that
 human.
 We
 had
 a
 human


doing
 it.
 we're
 going
 to
 redeploy
 them


to
 do
 other
 things
 and
 the
 consistency


of
 this
 chimoth
 and
 the
 accuracy
 and


then
 it's
 doing
 it
 all
 night
 long.
 So
 we


have
 like
 seven
 of
 these
 agents
 in
 these


kind
 of
 roles.
 The
 next
 piece
 we
 did
 was


we
 gave
 my
 agent
 which
 is
 like
 the


ultron
 root
 access
 to
 Gmail,
 calendar,


zoom,
 notion,
 slack.
 And
 what
 it's
 doing


is
 it's
 giving
 each
 person
 here's
 what


you
 got
 done
 this
 week
 with
 their


manager.
 Here's
 the
 emails
 you
 sent.


Here's
 the
 meetings
 you
 took.
 Here's
 the


contacts.
 here
 the
 threads
 you
 were


involved
 in
 and
 then
 it's
 helping
 manage


those
 people
 and
 so
 we
 are


>> okay
 but
 all
 that
 all
 that
 to
 me
 says


you
 Jason
 despite
 all
 your
 dumerism


seems
 like
 you're
 growing
 and
 you're


going
 to
 be
 hiring
 more
 people
 and


you're
 more
 productive
 am
 I
 getting
 this


wrong


>> I'm
 not
 dumerous
 what
 I
 think's
 going
 to


happen
 in
 this
 position
 is


>> but
 you're
 growing
 and
 you're
 going to


be
 hiring
 more
 people


>> no
 no
 we're
 not
 going to
 add
 more
 people


definitely
 not
 adding
 people
 we
 have
 are


becoming
 10
 or
 20%
 more
 efficient
 every


week
 Because
 the
 software
 we
 would
 have


paid
 for
 or
 built
 from
 another
 vendor
 if


we
 had
 the
 time
 or
 we
 wanted
 to
 build


custom
 software
 we
 had
 10
 engineers
 it's


being
 built
 by
 our
 openclaw
 agents.
 As


an
 example
 when
 we
 make
 clips
 for
 this


podcast
 other
 podcasts
 we
 have
 it
 go
 and


look
 at
 like
 uh
 this
 weekend
 startups


episode
 from
 10
 years
 tell
 us
 the
 three


best
 moments
 and
 it
 makes
 the
 clip
 it


puts
 the
 subtitles
 on
 it
 and
 then
 it


puts
 the
 clip
 into
 the
 Slack
 room.
 That


was
 something
 that
 was
 going
 to
 be
 a


full-time
 job.
 So,
 we're
 getting
 10
 20%


more
 efficient.
 Then
 I
 started
 doing
 it


at
 home.
 So,
 I
 had
 to
 take
 our


Instacart,
 pull
 out
 the
 last
 10
 orders


we
 did,
 and
 then
 tell
 us
 what
 we
 order


most
 of
 time.
 And
 then
 it's
 going
 to


automatically
 build
 a
 car
 for
 us.
 Every


single
 knowledge
 work
 job
 is
 being


automated
 right
 now.
 And
 you
 can
 take
 it


and
 if
 you're
 a
 business
 process
 head,


where
 you
 know
 how
 to
 like
 do
 a
 business


process
 and
 you
 can
 structure
 it
 and


write
 it
 with
 an
 agent,
 it'll
 just
 run


it
 every
 day,
 every
 week.
 We
 did
 another


agent,
 how
 do
 you
 make
 better


thumbnails?
 And
 we
 said,
 every
 Saturday


in
 your
 skills,
 so
 when
 you
 build
 an


open
 claw,
 it
 has
 like
 a
 soul
 file
 and


it
 has
 a
 skills
 file.
 In
 the
 skills


file,
 we
 told
 it
 sax
 every
 week
 go
 out


and
 look
 for
 people
 discussing
 how
 to


make
 better
 thumbnails
 on
 YouTube,
 how


to
 make
 better
 titles.
 It
 found
 this


week,
 Chimath,
 somebody
 at
 Mr.
 Beast


company
 talk
 about
 how
 they're
 using


heat
 maps.
 It
 was
 an
 article
 I
 would


have
 never
 known.
 It
 added
 it
 to
 its


skill
 and
 now
 whenever
 we
 post
 a


thumbnail,
 it
 tell
 tells
 us
 based
 on
 its


skill
 that
 it
 refineses
 every
 week
 how


to
 make
 that
 thumbnail
 better.
 And
 it's


starting
 to
 make
 the
 thumbnails.
 This
 is


becoming
 recursive.
 So
 you
 keep
 the
 same


number
 of
 people,
 but
 they
 get
 10
 or
 20%


more
 efficient.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 this


means
 for
 the
 larger
 economy.
 All
 I
 know


is
 it's
 the
 most
 exciting
 time
 I've
 had


online
 since
 the
 web
 came
 out,
 since
 the


internet
 came
 out.
 It
 is
 so
 much
 fun
 to


automate
 all
 this
 stuff.
 The
 big


question
 that
 I
 am
 thinking
 about
 that
 I


haven't
 gotten
 a
 good
 answer
 about
 so
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 you
 guys
 think


is


all
 these
 businesses
 are
 going
 to
 need


to
 batten
 down
 the
 hatches
 and
 give


themselves
 room
 to
 figure
 this
 all
 out


right
 like
 if
 you
 take
 Sax's
 point
 like


if
 you
 take
 your
 point
 Jal
 which
 is
 the


young
 nimble
 companies
 like
 yours
 are


going
 to
 be
 rapidly
 experimenting
 the


bigger
 larger
 companies
 are
 going
 to


slowly
 onboard
 themselves
 to
 start


experimenting
 All
 of
 that
 means
 we're


going
 to
 get
 much
 clearer
 answers
 to
 all


of
 this.
 But
 what
 it
 also
 means
 is
 that


you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 have
 time
 so


that
 you
 can
 figure
 this
 all
 out.


>> And


if
 you
 want
 to
 buy
 yourself
 time,
 you're


going
 to
 need
 a
 ton
 of
 cash.
 And
 if


you're
 going
 to
 think
 about
 saving
 cash,


the
 one
 place
 tech
 companies
 literally


incinerate
 cash
 is
 how
 they
 do


compensation.


And
 so
 I
 kind
 of
 think
 like
 at
 some


point
 the
 next
 shoe
 will
 drop
 and
 all
 of


these
 tech
 companies
 have
 to
 really
 look


at
 stockbased
 comp
 because
 they


literally
 incinerate
 most
 if
 not
 all
 of


their
 free
 cash
 flow
 fighting
 the


delilution
 from
 stockbased
 compensation.


So
 if
 you
 want
 five
 or
 six
 years
 to
 just


be
 in
 the
 arena
 on
 the
 field
 figuring


this
 out,
 you're
 going
 to
 want
 to
 kind


of
 be
 very
 cash
 flow
 generative
 and


really
 conservative
 in
 how
 you
 spend


your
 money.
 Yeah,
 Saxs,
 the
 people
 who


embrace
 this,
 I
 think,
 become
 five
 or


ten
 times
 more
 valuable
 than
 the
 people


who
 are
 not.
 That's
 where
 I
 think
 the


opportunity
 in
 the
 economy
 is.
 So,


unless
 you
 think
 humanity
 is
 going
 to


run
 out
 of
 problems
 to
 solve,
 I
 think


it's
 going
 to
 be
 boom.
 It's
 going
 to
 be


boom
 town.
 And
 I
 think
 people
 are
 going


to
 start
 more
 companies
 because
 the
 the


barrier
 to
 start
 a
 company
 is
 no
 longer


three
 or
 four
 million
 dollars.
 You
 can


just
 have
 two
 or
 three
 people
 and
 you


start
 setting
 up
 these
 agents
 and
 man


you
 can


>> make
 software,
 you
 can
 do
 sales,
 you
 can


do
 PR,
 everything
 is
 getting
 faster
 and


faster
 and
 faster.
 So
 the
 time
 between


like
 conceiving
 of
 a
 product
 and


publishing
 it
 and
 finding
 a
 developer,


you
 don't
 even
 need
 a
 developer,
 you
 can


just
 publish
 software,
 the
 the
 wakeup


moment
 for
 me
 was
 we
 were
 talking
 to
 our


agent
 about,
 hey,
 we
 want
 to
 get
 this


functionality
 out
 of
 Slack.
 And
 it's


like,
 "Yeah,
 Slack
 doesn't
 have
 that,


but
 have
 you
 considered
 Matterpost?"
 I'm


like, "What's
 Matter
 Post?"
 Like,
 "Oh,


it's
 an
 open
 source
 project.
 I
 can
 spin


it
 up
 this
 weekend.
 Export
 your
 Slack


instance
 and
 put
 it
 there."
 And
 I
 was


like, "Oh,
 don't
 do
 that.
 We're
 only


spending
 6K
 a
 year
 on
 Slack
 or
 10K
 a


year."
 But
 the
 software
 is
 building
 CRM


systems
 for
 us.
 It's
 building
 agents
 for


us,
 and
 it
 wants
 to
 just
 build
 all
 the


software
 stack.
 So
 you
 could
 when
 you


renegotiate
 with
 Slack
 or
 HubSpot
 or


whatever
 company
 you're
 working
 with,


you're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 say
 to
 them,


hey,
 we
 could
 roll
 our
 own
 and
 uh
 when


you
 want
 to
 upsell
 us
 on
 this
 latest


thing
 like
 you
 talked
 about
 SAS,


upselling
 is
 such
 a
 big
 part
 of
 SAS.


You're
 like,
 I
 can
 actually
 build
 that


software
 myself
 internally.
 I
 don't
 need


you
 to
 do
 it.


>> Ryan
 Peterson
 just
 posts
 on
 XC
 Claude


for
 legal
 seems
 to
 work
 just
 as
 well
 as


Harvey
 by
 the
 way.
 Now
 it's
 the
 SAS


apocalypse
 is
 going
 after
 private


companies
 now
 too.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 for
 a
 while
 now
 there
 has


been
 a
 question
 of
 which
 layer
 of
 the


stack
 is
 going
 to
 capture
 all
 the
 value.


>> So
 is
 it
 going
 to
 be
 the
 model
 companies


or
 could
 it
 be
 the
 applications
 that
 are


built
 on
 top
 of
 the
 models
 or
 you
 know


if
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 competition
 at
 both


those
 layers
 of
 the
 stack
 did
 the
 chip


companies
 get
 it
 all?
 I
 think
 it's
 a


unclear
 question
 but


>> totally


>> yeah
 I
 think
 you
 know
 for
 any
 given


vertical
 application
 you
 do
 have
 to


defend
 why
 you
 think
 your
 value
 prop


will
 be
 sustainable
 as
 the
 underlying


foundation
 models
 get
 better
 themselves


>> and
 it's
 open
 source
 like
 this
 week
 we


put
 up
 Kimmy
 2.5
 it
 can
 do
 about
 80
 85%


of
 the
 jobs
 so
 we
 lowered
 our
 token


bills
 massively
 when
 we
 stood
 that
 up


all right
 listen
 this
 is
 TBD
 We
 got
 a


lot
 more
 to
 think
 about
 on
 this
 topic.


>> Just
 on
 this
 point
 of
 a
 lot
 of these


debates
 about
 AI
 are
 dueling
 science


fiction
 narratives.
 I
 just
 think
 that


the
 doomer
 narratives
 are
 inherently


more
 appealing
 to
 people.
 I
 mean,
 I


think
 it's
 partly
 just
 you
 look
 at
 most


sci-fi
 movies
 are
 dystopian,
 not


utopian.
 In
 addition
 to
 that,
 I
 think
 we


have
 a
 bunch
 of
 heristic
 biases
 in
 favor


of
 the
 dumer
 narrative.
 So,
 one
 of
 them


is
 the
 scene
 versus
 the
 unseen.
 It's
 a


lot
 easier
 to
 see
 the
 jobs
 that
 already


exist
 that
 could
 be
 obsoleted
 than
 it
 is


to
 imagine
 the
 new
 jobs
 and
 the
 new


business
 models
 that
 haven't
 been


created
 yet.
 And
 that
 will
 likely
 take


some
 great
 innovator
 or
 a
 genius
 to


think
 of
 in
 order
 to
 create.
 So
 we
 have


that
 huge
 heristic
 bias
 of
 not
 being


able
 to
 see
 the
 creation
 that's
 coming.


It
 takes
 way
 less
 creativity
 to
 think


about
 the
 potential
 destruction.
 And


then
 finally
 I
 think
 you
 know
 the
 other


heristic
 is
 just
 the
 whole
 fixed
 pie


fallacy.
 Most
 people
 do
 tend
 to
 think
 of


the
 economy
 as
 a
 fixed
 pie.
 This
 is
 why


you
 see
 so
 much
 anger
 against
 you
 know


millionaires
 and
 billionaires
 is
 because


of
 this
 idea
 that
 if
 someone's
 getting


rich
 it
 must
 be
 at
 the
 expense
 of


someone
 else.
 That's
 not
 actually
 the


case.
 The
 economy
 itself
 could
 be


growing
 larger
 as
 a
 result
 of
 someone


inventing
 something
 new
 that
 increases


production.
 A
 really
 good
 line
 from


another
 article
 that
 was
 written
 just
 a


couple
 weeks
 ago
 was
 the
 economy
 is
 not


a
 a
 pie,
 it's
 a
 garden
 and
 technology
 is


rain.
 So
 again,
 you
 know,
 all
 of
 this


technological
 innovation
 is
 going
 to


increase
 the
 growth
 rate
 of
 the
 garden.


It's
 not
 a
 fixed
 pie.
 And
 just
 because


you
 see
 an
 expansion
 and
 productivity
 in


one
 part
 of
 the
 economy
 does
 not
 mean


that
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 job
 loss
 in


another
 part
 of
 the
 economy.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 the
 job
 people
 are
 not


seeing
 but
 I'm
 seeing
 right
 now
 is
 the


person
 who
 creates
 agents,
 manages
 them


and
 is
 the
 maestro
 of
 the
 agents.
 The


person
 who
 can
 take
 the
 business


process,
 explain
 it
 and
 train
 the
 agent


to
 do
 it.
 And
 there
 are
 certain
 people


in
 business
 who
 are
 just
 really
 good
 at


operations.
 You
 were
 one
 of
 them
 Sachs


running
 companies
 and
 like
 that
 person


who
 can
 fire
 up
 an
 agent,
 train
 the


agent
 and
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 manage
 them


and
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 increase


>> with
 any
 new
 technology.
 Great
 job.
 and


it's
 not
 a
 developer.


>> Look,
 with
 any
 new
 technology,
 there's


always
 a
 huge
 change
 management
 aspect


with
 enterprises
 because
 it's
 hard
 for


them
 to
 adapt
 and
 change.
 And
 the
 people


in
 the
 organization
 who
 can
 lead
 that


change
 management
 are
 the
 ones
 who
 are


going
 to
 create
 an
 amazing
 career


opportunity
 for
 themselves.
 But
 it's


hard
 to
 do
 and
 that's
 going
 to
 slow
 down


the
 rate
 of
 change
 just
 the
 amount
 of


inertia
 in
 the
 economy.
 And
 also
 one


other
 constraint
 is
 going
 to
 be
 that
 at


some
 point
 here
 we
 may
 be
 token


constrained,
 right?
 I
 mean,
 we
 may
 not


have
 enough
 energy
 like
 we've
 talked


about,
 even
 though
 the
 chips
 are
 getting


so
 much
 better,
 that
 tokens
 per
 second,


tokens
 per
 watt,
 and
 tokens
 per
 dollar


are
 all
 increasing
 very
 fast,
 but
 we're


still
 going
 to
 probably
 be
 constrained


in
 the
 next
 couple
 of
 years
 on
 some


dimension,
 whether
 it's
 land,
 power,


shell,
 or
 just
 energy
 production
 or


maybe
 chip
 production.
 There
 are
 real


world
 constraints
 on
 just
 how
 fast
 we


can
 scale
 the
 infrastructure
 and
 that


will
 mean
 that
 these
 like
 hyper
 utopian


or
 hyperdystopian
 narratives
 will
 be


wrong.
 I
 don't
 think
 there's
 time
 in
 the


next
 few
 years
 for
 the
 whole
 economy
 to


change
 in
 the
 way
 that
 the
 extremes


would
 present.


>> I
 think
 you're
 right.
 I
 think
 you're


going
 to
 see
 a
 10xing
 in


the
 demand
 for
 tokens,
 but
 I
 also
 think


you're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 90%
 price


reduction
 in
 the
 cost
 of
 an
 output
 token


probably
 by
 the
 end
 of
 this
 year.
 So,
 I


think
 that
 to
 your
 point,
 like
 it's
 it's


going
 to
 just
 create
 an
 enormous
 upswell


of
 demand
 because
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 able


to
 cut
 the
 prices
 of
 an
 output
 token
 so


dramatically.
 And
 I
 think
 by
 the
 way


>> that
 discussion
 we
 had
 Shamath
 last
 week


when
 we
 talked
 about
 co
 the
 tokens


outpacing
 the
 employee
 salary
 and
 just


where
 are
 these
 tokens
 all
 going
 to
 come


from
 that
 was
 our
 most
 viewed
 clip
 or


one
 of the
 most
 viewed
 clips
 in
 the


history
 of
 this
 podcast.
 So
 people
 are


actually
 really
 focused
 on
 this.


>> I
 had
 my
 team
 at
 89
 we
 we
 redid
 our
 cost


model
 and
 now
 we
 have
 that
 as
 a
 line


item.
 When
 we
 think
 about
 fully
 burdened


cost
 of
 employees,
 we
 now
 factor
 that
 in


because
 we're
 we're
 at
 a
 place
 where


some
 of
 our
 engineers
 are
 just
 racking


up
 ginormous
 bills
 and
 then
 separately


just
 general
 runs
 that
 we
 do
 for
 general


purpose
 stuff
 that
 we
 need
 to
 just
 run


our
 product
 is
 it's
 so
 expensive.
 So
 I


am
 waiting
 with
 baited
 breath
 for
 what


Zach
 said
 which
 is
 like
 we
 need
 an


explosion
 in
 the
 capacity
 that's


available
 because
 I
 do
 think
 that
 the


the
 silicon
 solutions
 are
 coming
 that


will
 cut
 the
 cost
 but
 we
 need
 a
 large


block
 of
 land
 power
 shell
 ready
 to
 then


turn
 all
 of
 this
 stuff
 on
 so
 that
 we
 can


actually
 take
 advantage
 of
 it.


>> Rumors
 the
 new
 Mac
 Studio
 is
 coming
 will


have
 an
 M5
 chip
 in
 it
 and
 will
 be


language
 model
 ready.
 So
 that's
 the


rumor
 is
 that
 they're
 building
 it
 for


models.
 So
 that
 could
 be
 an
 incredible


turn
 of
 events.
 Everybody's
 desktop


running
 the
 local
 model.
 Sax,
 you
 want


to
 have
 the
 final
 word
 here?
 Uh
 Free
 or


Freeberg
 before
 we


>> just
 to
 go
 back
 to
 what
 Jamath
 was


saying
 there.
 I
 mean,
 you've
 got


political
 forces
 that
 want
 to
 stop
 the


construction
 of
 all
 data
 centers
 in
 the


United
 States.
 So


>> if
 that
 gains
 steam,
 then
 that's
 going


to
 be
 a
 huge
 constraint
 on
 any
 change


whatsoever.


>> Can
 I
 tee
 this
 up
 for
 you,
 Jal?
 So
 I
 I


went
 back
 this
 weekend


and
 I
 looked
 at
 the
 number
 of
 data


centers
 that
 have
 faced
 local
 opposition


and
 whether
 there
 were
 patterns.
 And
 I
 I


posted
 it
 on
 X.
 So
 Nick,
 maybe
 you
 can


put
 this
 up,
 but


it
 was
 really
 a
 a
 very
 small


behavior
 which
 was
 pushing
 back
 on
 data


centers
 and
 getting
 them
 cancelled.
 We


had
 about
 25
 projects
 total
 of
 which


20
 were
 just
 in
 Q2
 alone.
 There
 are
 100


data
 center
 projects
 right
 now
 that
 are


facing
 some
 form
 of
 local
 opposition.


>> So
 interesting.


>> If
 you
 take
 that
 40%
 number
 and
 you


apply
 this
 and
 then
 you
 multiply
 by
 the


number
 of
 megawatts
 that
 they
 have


announced.
 Last
 year
 we
 lost
 almost
 5


gawatt


in
 terms
 of
 cancel
 projects.


This
 year
 coming
 in
 26
 we
 have
 about


seven
 that
 could
 be
 cancelled
 if
 you
 use


this
 math.
 If
 then
 you
 flow
 that
 through


open
 AI
 Sarah
 Frier
 said
 this
 that
 every


gigawatt
 for
 her
 for
 open
 AAI
 is
 about


10
 billion
 of
 revenue.
 So
 if
 you
 if
 you


assume
 that
 that's
 roughly
 accurate
 plus


or
 minus
 a
 billion
 here
 or
 there.
 What


that
 means
 is
 that
 2025
 the
 industry
 as


a
 whole
 lost


50
 billion
 of
 revenue


and
 this
 year
 if
 7
 gawatt
 gets
 canceled


it's
 about
 70
 billion.
 Now
 you're


talking
 about
 130
 billion
 of
 lost


revenue
 over
 these
 two
 years
 that'll
 go


forward
 in
 time
 that
 we
 miss
 out
 on.
 I


think
 that
 that's
 really
 bad.
 We
 need
 to


figure
 out
 a
 way
 to
 nip
 this
 in
 the
 bud.


>> So
 confounding
 because
 we
 were
 sitting


here
 5
 years
 ago,
 10
 years
 ago,
 local


municipalities
 were
 fighting
 and
 giving


discounts
 to
 try
 to
 get
 these
 data


centers
 open
 to
 get
 the
 jobs
 and
 get
 the


revenue.
 And
 now
 we've
 got
 people
 trying


to
 stop
 them.
 This
 is
 a
 perfect


transition
 for
 the
 State
 of
 the
 Union.


Before
 we
 get
 there,
 two
 important


programming
 notes.
 All-In
 is
 going
 to


host
 two
 events
 in
 2026.
 One
 of
 them,


liquidity,
 May
 31st
 to
 June
 3rd,
 uh,
 in


Yonville,
 uh,
 up
 in
 Wine
 Country.


Chimath
 has
 taken
 control
 of
 the
 event


and
 he
 has
 set
 a
 standard
 for
 who
 gets


on
 stage.


>> None
 of
 you
 mids
 can
 control
 the


programming.
 I
 just


>> That's
 it.
 Chimath
 came
 in
 and
 he


dropped
 the
 hammer.
 Who
 do
 you
 got
 so


far?
 You
 want
 to
 tease
 a
 couple
 of


people
 who
 you
 invited
 to
 come
 speak?


>> I'll
 tease
 two.
 The
 first
 is
 an


incredibly
 dear
 friend
 of
 mine,


>> the
 axe
 of
 axes,


Dan
 Loe,
 who
 founded
 Third
 Point,
 who
 is


an
 unbelievable
 investor
 in
 literally


every
 domain,
 private
 credit,


public
 equities,
 private
 tech.


He's
 he's
 just
 a
 he's


>> a
 beast.
 So,
 he'll
 be
 doing
 a
 really


important
 keynote.
 He
 has
 not
 done
 one


of
 these
 public
 speaking
 slots
 in
 a
 very


long
 time.
 And
 then
 the
 second
 is
 the


CFO
 of
 OpenAI,
 Sarah
 Frier.


>> Oh
 wow.


>> Unbelievable
 start.
 And
 we're
 going
 to


double
 click
 into
 the
 entire
 business


model
 of
 OpenAI
 on
 stage
 in
 front
 of


everybody.


>> So
 uh
 go
 to
 allin.com
 and
 then
 for
 those


of
 you
 who
 plan
 ahead
 for
 travel,


>> more
 coming
 more
 coming
 every
 week.


>> If
 you
 are
 an
 All-In
 Summit
 fan,
 I
 can't


believe
 it.
 Freedber,
 we're
 going
 to
 be


in
 our
 fifth
 year
 September
 13th
 to


15th.
 only
 gets
 better.
 Gets
 better


every
 year.
 I
 could
 have
 some
 good


parties,
 too.
 I
 mean,
 that
 Back
 to
 the


Future
 and
 the
 Bladeunner
 parties,
 those


were
 epic.


>> allin.com/events.
 Hey,
 can
 I
 give
 a
 plug


to
 friend
 of
 the
 pod,


>> Bill
 Gurly?
 He's
 got
 an
 amazing
 new


book,
 Running
 Down
 a
 Dream.
 Please,


>> wait,
 wait,
 wait,
 wait.
 Before
 we
 start,


>> before
 I
 start,


>> there
 it
 is.
 Running
 down
 a
 Dream,
 I


just
 want
 everybody
 to
 just
 stop
 the


pause
 the
 podcast.
 I
 want
 you
 to
 buy


three
 copies,
 give
 it
 to
 two
 young


people
 and
 a
 parent.
 You
 know,


>> this
 book
 is
 incredible.


>> It's
 a
 great
 book.
 It's
 a
 great
 book.
 It


It
 really
 is.
 inspiring
 for
 kids
 and
 uh


Bill
 Gurly,
 friend
 of
 the
 pot.
 He
 always


shows
 up
 for
 us.


>> Jal,
 do
 an
 impression
 for
 us
 of
 what
 it


would
 be
 like
 if
 you
 and
 Bill
 Gurley


started
 a
 podcast
 together.


>> All
 right,
 everybody.
 Welcome
 to
 the


JCBG
 podcast.
 I'm
 your
 host,
 Jason


Calakanis.
 and
 I'm
 Bill
 Gurly
 and
 we're


here
 in
 Texas
 at
 Terry
 Blacks
 where


we're
 getting
 some
 beef
 ribs
 and
 we're


going
 to
 discuss
 investing
 in


marketplaces


as
 well
 as
 my
 new
 book
 running
 down
 a


dream
 which
 will
 teach
 your
 kids
 how
 to


not
 be
 fuckups
 and
 if
 your
 kids
 are
 ups


you
 can
 hit
 them
 in
 the
 back
 of
 the
 head


with
 the
 book


Texas
 style.


One
 of
 the
 big
 topics
 uh
 and
 I
 think


something
 you're
 working
 on
 with


President
 Trump's
 acts
 is
 uh
 this
 energy


pledge.
 I've
 been
 seeing
 uh
 rumblings


about
 this.
 Explain
 what's
 going
 on
 in


terms
 of
 getting
 the
 country
 in
 sync


around
 these
 data
 centers
 and
 energy.


Well,
 the
 president
 announced
 in
 the


State
 of
 the
 Union
 last
 night
 that
 he


supports
 a
 rateayer
 protection
 pledge


which
 requires
 uh
 the
 major
 tech


companies
 to
 provide
 for
 their
 own
 power


needs
 for
 AI
 data
 centers
 so
 that


residential
 consumers
 do
 not
 see
 their


rates
 going
 up.
 I
 think
 this
 makes
 total


sense.
 I
 think
 Chamas,
 to
 your
 point,


this
 is
 the
 reason
 behind
 a
 lot
 of
 the


opposition
 to
 new
 data
 centers
 is
 that


the
 local
 residents
 fear
 that
 their


electricity
 prices
 are
 going
 to
 go
 up


and
 that
 shouldn't
 be
 the
 case.
 And
 so


the
 president
 has
 said
 that
 he's


committed
 to
 not
 allowing
 residential


rates
 to
 go
 up
 as
 a
 result
 of
 data


centers.
 It's
 pretty
 straightforward.


You
 get
 the
 big
 tech
 companies,
 the


hyperscalers
 to
 pay
 for
 the
 increase
 in


the
 electricity
 cost
 or
 you
 let
 them
 set


up
 their
 own
 power
 behind
 the
 meter.
 The


president's
 been
 talking
 about
 this
 for


over
 a
 year
 that
 our
 biggest
 AI


companies
 would
 also
 become
 big
 power


companies
 because
 we
 would
 let
 them
 uh


stand
 up
 their
 own
 power
 generation


behind
 the
 meter.
 So
 these
 data
 centers


don't
 even
 have
 to
 connect
 to
 the
 grid.


They
 could
 just
 do
 collocation


themselves.
 But
 also,
 I
 think
 that
 with


this
 rateayer
 protection
 pledge,
 what


you're
 going
 to
 see
 is
 that
 it
 could


actually
 bring
 down
 consumer
 prices


because
 what
 happens
 is
 that
 when
 these


data
 centers
 then
 set
 up
 their
 own
 power


and
 connect
 to
 the
 grid,
 they
 can
 give


back
 the
 excess
 to
 the
 grid.
 Also,
 they


will
 make
 investments
 in
 scaling
 the


infrastructure.
 So,
 although
 electricity


is
 priced
 at
 a
 metered
 rate,
 the
 costs


to
 generate
 it
 are
 not
 all
 variable.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 huge
 fixed
 costs
 in


there.
 So
 when
 you
 increase
 scale
 then


you
 can
 actually
 reduce
 the
 the
 metered


rate.
 So
 again
 you
 know
 this
 is
 really
 I


think
 the
 rebuttal
 to
 Bernie
 Sanders
 who


just
 wants
 to
 stop
 all
 progress


whatsoever.


I
 saw
 a
 funny
 post
 calling
 it
 bananas


which
 is
 build
 absolutely
 nothing


anywhere
 near
 anyone.
 So
 this
 is
 the


>> bananas
 is
 replacing
 the
 new
 nimi.
 So


you
 just
 can
 build
 absolutely
 nothing.
 I


think
 the
 president's
 approach
 finds
 a


very
 good
 balance
 here,
 which
 is
 look,


>> we
 can
 have
 progress.
 Just
 don't
 make


residential
 consumers
 pay
 for
 it.
 Let


the
 big
 tech
 companies
 pay
 for
 it


themselves.
 And
 I
 think
 you'll
 see
 more


coming
 out
 about
 this
 from
 the
 White


House
 next
 week.


>> Quite
 a
 deaf
 move.
 Freeberg,
 how
 should


America
 be
 thinking
 about
 this
 great


data
 center
 buildout,
 energy
 usage,
 you


know,
 if
 you
 expand
 it
 out
 over
 the


coming
 decade?
 And
 how
 do
 you
 sell
 that


to
 the
 backdrop
 that
 you
 talk
 about
 the


socialist
 movement?
 You
 got
 a
 great


interview
 coming
 out
 with
 Ray
 Dalio
 and


the
 all-in
 interview
 program
 next
 week.


How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 those
 competing


forces?
 You've
 got
 the
 socialists
 saying


bananas,
 nimi,
 slow
 down,
 del,
 and
 then


you've
 got
 this
 incredible
 race
 we're
 in


for
 efficiency
 and
 this
 opportunity
 and


abundance.
 How
 would
 you
 sell
 it
 to
 kind


of
 bring
 these
 two
 sides
 together?
 Or
 is


it
 just


impossible.
 The
 data
 coming
 in
 and
 out


of
 data
 centers
 moves
 at
 roughly
 the


speed
 of
 light.
 So
 you
 could
 put
 them


anywhere.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 our
 policy


makers
 need
 to
 be
 very
 cognizant
 of
 that


fact.
 You
 have
 and
 we
 do
 connect
 the


internet
 using
 high-speed
 cable,


high-speed


fiber
 optic
 throughout
 the
 world.
 And
 so


theoretically
 if
 we
 don't
 embrace
 and


allow
 the
 economic
 development
 of
 the


data
 center
 industry
 and
 it
 will


fundamentally
 be
 an
 industry
 because
 it


is
 almost
 like
 the
 new
 sort
 of
 oil.


Where
 are
 the
 oil
 rigs
 going
 to
 go?


Where
 are
 the
 railroads
 going
 to
 go?


Where
 are
 the
 telegraph
 lines
 going
 to


go?
 Where
 are
 the
 factories
 going
 to
 go?


If
 we
 don't
 put
 them
 here,
 someone
 else


will
 put
 them
 on
 their
 shores.
 Someone


else
 will
 put
 them
 in
 their
 country.


Someone
 else
 will
 put
 them
 in
 their


jurisdiction.
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 economic


value
 that
 arises
 from
 the
 people
 that


will
 build
 those
 facilities,
 the
 energy


that
 will
 be
 installed
 to
 produce
 power


for
 those
 facilities,
 and
 then
 all
 of


the
 second
 and
 third
 order
 industries


that
 emerge
 as
 a
 result
 of
 those


installations,
 that
 value
 will
 acrue


elsewhere.


>> Such
 a
 good
 point.


>> So,


>> yeah,


>> it's
 not
 going
 to
 like
 just
 go
 away.
 The


the
 demand
 is
 there.
 The
 economy
 is


moving
 forward.
 AI
 is
 moving
 forward.
 We


live
 in
 a
 world
 with
 196
 countries
 and


data
 centers
 do
 not
 take
 up
 a
 lot
 of


space.
 They're
 very
 small
 relative
 to


the
 economic
 value
 that
 they
 produce.
 If


you
 zoom
 out
 on
 the
 map
 of
 the
 world,


all
 the
 data
 centers
 in
 the
 world
 fit


under
 the
 tip
 of
 a
 pin.
 And
 so
 this
 is
 a


very
 small
 footprint
 and
 if
 we're
 going


to
 give
 up
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 jobs


and
 many
 billions
 of
 dollars
 of
 economic


value
 creation,
 we're
 being
 pretty
 silly


and
 pretty
 obtuse
 in
 our
 view
 of
 the


world.
 I
 would
 just
 like
 encourage
 the


system
 that
 I
 think
 is
 the
 right
 system


and
 we
 talked
 about
 this
 last
 time
 where


provided
 data
 centers
 are
 producing


their
 own
 electricity.
 That
 means
 that


you're
 taking
 electricity
 consumption


off
 the
 grid
 because
 they
 otherwise
 are


not
 being
 used
 on
 the
 grid
 and
 that
 will


reduce
 the
 cost
 of
 electricity
 for
 other


residential
 and
 industrial
 users.
 So,


it's
 silly
 to
 think
 that
 we
 need
 to
 put


a
 moratorium
 on
 data
 centers.
 As
 soon
 as


you
 do
 that,
 the
 companies
 that
 use
 data


centers
 are
 not
 going
 to
 slow
 down.


they're
 going to
 go
 put
 them
 somewhere


else
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 miss
 out.


>> And
 it's
 such
 a
 good
 point,
 Chimamoth,


because
 you
 were
 recently
 in
 the
 Middle


East
 and
 I've
 been
 there
 a
 bunch
 in


Saudi,
 UAE.
 These
 are
 the
 folks
 who


built
 a
 large
 portion
 of
 those
 oil


refineries.
 And
 they
 are
 savvy
 to
 this.


And
 what
 are
 they
 doing
 in
 Saudi,
 UAE,


Qatar,
 all
 of
 these
 regions?
 They're


doubling
 down.
 They're
 10xing
 their
 data


center
 builds.
 So
 to
 your
 point,


Freedberg,
 either
 we
 build
 them
 or


they're
 going
 to
 go
 somewhere
 else.
 And


there
 are
 people
 who
 are
 willing
 to


underwrite
 these
 and
 they're
 willing
 to


take
 out
 the
 red
 tape


from
 the
 process
 here
 and
 move
 quicker


than
 us.
 So
 we
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 pretty


deaf
 move
 by
 President
 Trump
 to
 say,


"Hey,
 you
 guys
 should
 all
 just
 guarantee


that
 consumers
 don't
 get
 impacted."
 The


water
 thing
 is
 a
 total
 hoax.
 Like
 the


water
 is
 recirculated.
 That's
 a
 hoax.
 I


think
 this
 is
 really
 smart.
 I
 think
 that


what
 the
 president's
 doing
 and
 what
 Sax


is
 doing
 is
 really
 smart.
 The
 thing
 to


keep
 in
 mind
 is
 that
 there's
 still
 a


risk
 that
 prices
 go
 up
 and
 it
 has


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 these
 data
 centers


and
 it
 has
 everything
 to
 do
 with
 the


business
 model
 of
 being
 a
 utility


because
 what
 happens
 is
 in
 order
 to
 get


a
 license
 a
 monopoly
 license
 in
 an
 area


to
 provide
 energy
 to
 generate
 energy
 for


a
 community.


The
 exchange
 works
 in
 the
 following
 way.


You
 go
 and
 you
 present
 a
 capex
 plan
 to


the
 public
 utilities
 commission.
 That's


effectively
 your
 budget
 that
 says
 here


are
 the
 lines
 I'm
 going
 to
 upgrade.
 Here


are
 the
 generators
 I'm
 going
 to
 upgrade.


Independent
 of
 data
 centers.
 The
 reality


is
 the
 draw
 the
 electricity
 consumption


of
 individual
 Americans
 is
 going
 up


because
 we
 have
 more
 devices,
 we
 have


cars,
 we
 have
 all
 of
 these
 other
 things.


So
 what
 we
 also
 have
 to
 do
 is
 we
 have
 to


look
 at
 how
 utilities's
 business
 model


actually
 incentivizes
 them
 to
 increase


prices
 by
 making
 all
 kinds
 of


investments.
 So
 we
 have
 to
 do
 a
 good
 job


of
 making
 sure
 we
 hold
 everybody


accountable
 because
 otherwise
 what
 you


could
 see
 is
 that
 the
 data
 centers


taking
 on
 the
 burden
 for
 themselves
 but


price
 is
 still
 continuing
 to
 escalate


because
 a
 utility
 says
 I
 need
 to
 spend
 a


billion
 dollars
 this
 year
 to
 upgrade
 my


infrastructure.
 And
 what
 that
 allows


them
 to
 do
 is
 take
 that
 billion
 dollars


and
 essentially
 invest
 it
 for
 a
 return.


That's
 the
 business
 model
 of
 utility.


And
 this
 is
 really
 happening
 in
 blue


states.
 Micron
 has
 a
 hundred
 billion


dollar
 mega
 fab
 in
 New
 York.
 And
 there's


a
 lawsuit
 by
 six
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 citizens.


>> That's
 shameful.


>> And
 the
 project
 has
 taken
 12


>> 1200
 days.
 1,200
 days


>> between
 their
 announcement
 and
 the


groundbreaking.
 And
 they
 spent
 612
 days


on
 the
 environmental
 impact
 study.


People
 wake
 up.
 Just
 go
 to
 Texas.
 Elon


built
 his
 factory
 here,
 the
 Gigafactory,


in
 under
 like
 18
 months.
 This
 is
 the


great
 state
 of
 Texas.
 Come
 here.
 We'll


build
 it
 for
 you
 and
 you'll
 be
 done.


>> Yeah.
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 anyone
 bothers


with
 the
 blue
 states
 anymore.
 They
 make


it
 too
 hard
 to
 build.


>> It's
 [ __ ]
 It's
 so
 dumb.
 It's
 such
 a


self-owned,
 too.
 Like,
 what?
 Don't
 you


want
 to
 be
 part
 of
 the
 future?
 You're


literally
 ankling
 the
 entire
 country
 to


scratch
 the
 odd.


>> By
 the
 way,
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 in


New
 York
 who
 want
 to
 work.
 This
 is
 not
 a


case
 actually
 of
 this
 new
 fab
 being


unpopular.


The
 majority
 of
 people
 in
 the
 area


actually
 want
 this
 plant
 being
 built.


They
 want
 the
 jobs
 that
 are
 going
 to


come
 there.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 say
 data


centers
 don't
 create
 a
 lot
 of
 jobs.
 This


is
 actually
 a
 chip
 fab.
 So,
 it
 will


create
 a
 lot
 of
 jobs.
 A
 lot
 of
 good
 high


paying
 jobs.
 People
 want
 it.
 But
 six


people
 can
 stop
 it
 with
 a
 lawsuit
 after


it's
 already
 been
 through
 a
 two-year


environmental
 review.


>> It's
 not
 blue
 and
 red
 states.
 These
 are


nonprofits
 that
 get
 organized
 to
 create


this
 kind
 of
 chaos.
 I
 remember
 looking


at
 a
 massive
 lithium
 investment
 in


Nevada.
 And
 the
 whole
 point
 was
 to


domesticate


lithium
 production.
 And
 what
 was


interesting
 is
 this
 enormous
 deposit


that's
 just
 sitting
 there
 ripe
 for


development
 right
 before
 they
 were
 about


to
 get
 environmental
 approvals
 or
 right


after
 there
 was
 a
 lawsuit
 by
 people
 who


wanted
 to
 protect
 the
 upper
 land
 grass.


It's
 seared
 in
 my
 mind
 that
 the
 upper


land
 grass
 of
 Nevada
 is
 the
 reason
 why


we
 do
 not
 have
 domestic
 national


security
 around
 lithium.


And
 you
 have
 to
 ask
 yourself
 why
 is
 this


possible?
 And
 it's
 possible
 because
 you


have
 these
 environmental
 nonprofits
 that


can
 go
 and
 create
 this
 chaos
 with


absolutely
 no
 risk
 to
 them.
 Zero.
 They


can
 fund
 raise
 around
 it
 and
 they
 can


create
 this
 chaos.
 I
 mean,
 Nick,
 to
 this


point,
 this
 is
 an
 example
 of
 Greenpeace.


And
 specifically
 here,
 they
 were
 pushing


back
 on
 an
 oil
 pipeline
 to
 such
 a
 degree


and
 they
 created
 so
 much
 chaos
 that
 they


were
 sued.
 And
 a
 North
 Dakota
 judge
 just


said
 that
 he's
 going
 to
 order
 Greenpeace


to
 pay
 damages.
 That
 should
 total
 almost


$350
 million
 in
 connection
 to
 those


protests.


>> And
 it
 should
 not
 be
 the
 case
 that
 six


people
 can
 slow
 down
 a
 hundred
 billion


investment
 package.
 That's
 not
 right.


Well,
 I
 think
 there's
 and
 I
 just
 want
 to


highlight
 this
 important
 point.
 There's


not
 a
 lot
 of
 logic
 and
 reason.


You
 guys
 are
 right.
 But
 I
 do
 think


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 emotion
 and
 there's
 a


huge
 aversion
 to
 big
 tech,
 a
 huge


aversion
 to
 wealth
 creation
 by
 select


individuals,
 select
 companies,
 a
 huge


aversion
 to
 economic
 growth
 that
 doesn't


benefit
 everyone.
 There's
 a
 fundamental


kind
 of
 underlying
 left
 behind
 emotion


that
 drives
 a
 lot
 of
 this.
 And
 I've
 said


it
 before,
 but
 I
 think
 unless
 there's


systems
 or
 mechanisms
 that
 get
 folks
 to


come
 along
 with
 the
 value
 creation
 ahead


and
 and
 help
 them
 connect
 their
 own


lives
 to
 the
 value
 creation
 that's
 being


realized,
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 be


supportive
 because
 there
 is
 this
 kind
 of


diametric
 opposition
 towards
 big
 tech,


towards
 the
 wealth
 gap,
 towards
 value


acrruel
 to
 a
 select
 few
 companies
 or


select
 few
 individuals
 and
 this
 fuels


and
 feeds
 that.
 So
 I
 think
 fundamentally


maybe
 it's
 not
 just
 about
 giving
 the


data
 centers
 their
 own
 power
 capacity


but
 there's
 got
 to
 be
 mechanisms
 and


tools
 that
 helps
 the
 broader
 population


understand
 or
 recognize
 or
 get
 some


benefit
 from
 it
 as
 well
 where
 they're
 an


owner
 in
 it
 or
 participant
 in
 it
 because


they
 have
 the
 power
 as
 we're
 seeing
 they


have
 the
 power
 to
 stop
 it.
 Therefore


they
 want
 to
 have
 some
 benefit
 for


providing
 authority
 to
 do
 it.
 And
 these


six
 people
 are
 concerned
 about
 housing


costs,
 worker
 exposure
 to
 toxic


chemicals,
 pollution
 in
 air
 and
 water,


greenhouse
 gas
 emissions,
 energy


consumption,
 flooding
 of
 the
 wetlands,


all
 these
 things
 that
 obviously
 could
 be


mitigated.
 All right,
 let's
 keep
 moving


here.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 more
 docket
 to
 get


through.
 State
 of
 the
 Union
 came
 in
 at


108
 minutes


and
 it's
 the
 longest
 in
 60
 years.


actually
 the
 longest
 since
 they
 started


tracking
 this.
 The
 theme
 of
 President


Trump's
 State
 of
 the
 Union
 this
 year,


America
 at
 250,
 strong,
 prosperous,
 and


respected.
 Trump
 took
 a
 bunch
 of
 victory


laps,
 inflation,
 jobs,
 closing
 the


border,
 all
 those
 have
 gone
 really
 well.


But
 this
 comes
 to
 the
 backdrop
 of


Trump's
 approval
 rating
 being
 super


challenged.
 He
 started
 his
 first
 year
 at


plus
 11.7%.
 Now
 he's
 negative
 14
 14.3%


26
 point
 swing.
 Economy
 started
 plus
 3.4


down
 to
 18.2
 and
 trade
 started
 at
 5.9%


and
 we'll
 talk
 about
 the
 tariff
 stuff


later
 and
 went
 down
 to
 22.7.


So
 let's
 call
 balls
 and
 strikes
 here,


gentlemen.
 Favorite
 moments.
 What
 were


your
 favorite
 moments
 from
 the
 State
 of


the
 Union
 and
 just
 general
 impressions


of
 1
 hour
 and
 45
 minutes
 of
 Trump
 going


to
 town?


I
 thought
 it
 was
 great.


>> Favorite
 moment?
 Favorite
 moment
 or
 two?


Well,
 I
 had
 a
 couple.


One
 was
 the


Elon
 Omar
 Rashida
 Tlay
 death
 stare
 and


them
 just
 like
 losing
 their
 minds
 and


and
 screaming.
 I
 just
 thought
 it
 was
 so


unamerican.
 The
 second
 was
 when
 he
 was


calling
 for
 law
 and
 order
 where
 and


focusing
 and
 prioritizing
 on
 American


citizens
 and


>> illegal
 uh
 aliens


>> and
 none
 of
 the
 Democrats
 stood
 up.
 I


thought
 that
 was
 kind
 of
 foolish.
 It
 was


like
 obvious
 things
 and
 the
 Democrats


wouldn't
 applaud
 but
 this
 time
 they
 did


like
 they
 did
 for
 the
 hockey
 team
 which


I
 thought
 was
 like
 the
 right
 thing
 to


do.
 And
 then
 the
 fourth
 thing
 is
 just
 a


a
 shout
 out
 to
 our
 friend
 Brad
 Gersonner


who
 got
 a
 big
 shout
 out
 from
 the


president.
 I
 don't know
 Sax
 if
 you


engineered
 that
 or
 not
 but
 that
 was


>> that
 was
 fantastic.


He
 got
 like
 a
 double
 shout
 out.
 It
 was


like
 a
 double
 tap.


>> Yeah,
 that
 was
 really
 cool.


>> That
 was
 surreal.


>> Our
 group
 chat
 group
 chat
 went
 crazy.
 It


was
 really
 That
 was
 really
 cool.


>> Those
 are
 my
 four
 highlights.


>> Great.
 Here's
 your
 uh
 here's
 your
 clip


of
 uh
 yeah,
 Democrats
 not
 standing
 for


Americans
 uh
 over
 illegal
 aliens.
 20


seconds.


>> If
 you
 agree
 with
 this
 statement,
 then


stand
 up
 and
 show
 your
 support.
 The


first
 duty
 of
 the
 American
 government
 is


to
 protect
 American
 citizens,
 not


illegal
 aliens.


>> Why
 wouldn't
 you
 stand
 for
 that?
 That's


an
 easy
 one
 to
 stand
 for.
 Doesn't
 make


any
 sense.


>> Would
 you
 stand
 for
 it,
 Chico?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I'm
 I'm
 pro
 I
 can
 be


anti-ICE,
 but
 I'm
 pro-American
 and
 I'm


pro
 reasonable
 immigration
 like
 90%
 of


the
 country
 is.
 So,
 it
 just
 doesn't
 make


any
 sense.
 Uh,
 do
 you
 have
 any


highlight?


>> Do
 you
 think
 American
 citizens
 should
 be


prioritized
 over
 illegals?


>> Well,
 of
 course,
 of
 course.
 Yes.
 Of


course.
 Yes.
 And
 then
 I
 I
 also
 think


there
 should
 be
 a
 path
 to
 citizenship


for
 people
 who
 have
 been
 here
 for
 a


while.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 the


majority
 of
 the
 country
 thinks
 as
 well.


>> Your
 point
 is
 I
 can
 hold
 two
 thoughts
 in


my
 head.
 I
 would
 have
 stood
 if
 he
 asked


me.


>> Yes,
 obviously
 we
 should
 take
 care
 of


American
 citizens
 first.
 Yes.
 And
 we


should
 deport
 violent
 criminals.
 We've


been
 over
 this
 like
 a
 million
 times


here.
 This
 is
 like
 consensus.


>> But
 what
 do
 you
 what
 do
 you
 think
 is


going
 on
 in
 everybody
 else's
 head
 when


they're
 like
 we
 got
 to
 we
 cannot
 stand


for
 this?


>> These
 two
 sides
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 it's
 like


the
 tariff
 thing.
 It's
 like
 the
 ice


thing.
 These
 two
 sides
 cannot
 work


together.
 It's
 just
 the
 most
 polarized


it's
 ever
 been.
 Trump
 is
 not
 like
 the


kind
 of
 guy
 to
 reach
 across
 the
 aisle.


the
 Democrats
 are
 now
 digging
 in.
 So,
 we


just
 have
 a
 dysfunctional
 government


where,
 you
 know,
 in
 a
 more
 functional


time
 period,
 like
 under
 Clinton,
 let's


say,
 or
 Bush,
 people
 would
 have
 gotten


together,
 and
 I'm
 I'm
 jumping
 ahead
 to


the
 tariff
 discussion.
 And
 they
 would


have
 said,
 "Yeah,
 of
 course,
 tariffs
 are


done
 in
 Congress.
 That's
 the
 law.


Whatever.
 What
 are
 your
 thoughts,
 Mr.


President?
 How
 can
 we
 support
 your


tariff
 program?"
 But
 now
 it's
 like,
 "Oh,


well,
 we
 don't
 work
 together.
 We
 don't


actually
 have
 discussions
 anymore.


There's
 no
 bipartisan,


you
 know,
 collaboration.
 All
 these


politicians
 are
 disgraceful
 descriat


across
 the
 board.
 They
 should
 be
 working


together
 for
 the
 American
 people.
 If
 the


president
 wants
 to
 do
 tariffs,


>> they
 should
 be
 reasonable
 about
 it
 and


give
 him
 the
 power
 to
 do
 reasonable


tariffs
 and
 he
 should
 be
 reasonable
 and


say,
 "Hey,
 I
 understand
 that's
 your


power.
 Let's
 get
 together
 and
 we'll


we'll
 chop
 it
 up
 and
 let's
 have
 dinner


together."
 But
 they're
 just
 too


polarized.
 It's
 just
 disgraceful
 where


this
 country
 has
 gotten
 to.
 I
 blame
 both


parties.


Whenever
 the
 Democrats
 get
 smoked
 out
 as


being
 radicals
 and
 extremists,
 you


always
 want
 to
 basically
 say
 a
 pox
 on


both
 your
 houses
 and
 blame
 the


Republicans
 and
 Democrats
 equally.
 The


fact
 of
 the
 matter
 is
 the
 president
 said


to
 the
 audience,
 to
 the
 members
 of


Congress,
 hey,
 if
 you
 agree
 with
 the


statement,
 stand
 up.
 And
 of
 course,


every
 single
 Democrat
 sat
 there


stonefaced
 and
 refused
 to
 applaud
 or


acknowledge
 what
 he
 was
 saying.
 This
 was


a
 very
 easy
 test
 for
 the
 Democrats
 to


pass.


>> What
 I
 just
 said,


>> in
 fact,
 it
 was
 what
 I
 said.


>> In
 fact,
 it
 was
 a
 political
 risk
 for
 the


president
 because
 it
 was
 so
 easy
 for
 the


Democrats
 to
 demonstrate
 that
 they're


operating
 in
 good
 faith
 and
 that
 they're


willing
 to
 be
 bipartisan
 and
 they're
 not


extremists
 and
 they're
 actually
 common


sensical
 and
 logical
 and
 they
 completely


failed
 the
 test.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 it


wasn't
 just
 on
 that
 one.
 I
 mean,
 let
 me


just
 tell
 you
 some
 of
 the
 other
 ones


where
 they
 refused
 to
 applaud.
 So
 they


refused
 to
 applaud
 the
 grieving
 families


of
 innocent
 American
 women
 and
 children


murdered
 by
 criminal
 illegal
 aliens,


including
 the
 mother
 of
 Ireina


Zeritzkaya.


>> That
 was
 very
 sad.
 That
 was
 sad.


>> That
 was
 unbelievable.
 They
 refused
 to


applaud
 for
 securing
 our
 homeland
 and
 uh


ending
 the
 invasion
 of
 criminal
 illegal


aliens,
 killers,
 rapists,
 gang
 members,


and
 traffickers.
 They
 refused
 to
 applaud


for
 unifying
 against
 political
 violence.


So,
 the
 president
 mentioned
 the


assassination
 of
 Charlie
 Kirk.
 They


would
 not
 even
 do
 a
 polite
 clap
 for


Erica
 Kirk
 and
 unifying
 against


political
 violence.
 They
 refused
 to


applaud
 for
 keeping
 violent
 criminals


locked
 up.
 They
 even
 refused
 to
 applaud


for
 lower
 prescription
 drug
 prices
 for


millions
 of
 Americans
 because
 it
 was


President
 Trump
 who
 orchestrated
 that


policy.
 And
 there
 were
 so
 many
 other


examples
 like
 that.
 And
 you
 know,
 I


think
 the
 reason
 why
 this
 speech
 was
 so


effective,
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 it's
 not
 just


me
 saying
 it.
 something
 like
 twothirds


of
 the
 people
 that
 CNN
 pled,
 so


twothirds
 of
 CNN
 watchers
 said
 it
 was


highly
 effective
 and
 something
 like


threearters
 of
 CBS
 news
 viewers
 said
 it


was
 highly
 effective
 is
 because
 the


president
 laid
 out
 8020
 issue
 one
 after


another,
 right?
 Or
 even
 9010
 issues
 or


955
 issues.
 I
 mean,
 these
 were
 all


issues
 where
 the
 overwhelming
 number
 of


Americans,
 I
 think,
 agree
 with
 the


policy
 the
 president
 laid
 out.
 And
 in


every
 single
 case,
 the
 Democrats


supposed
 to
 wouldn't
 even
 give
 it


applied
 applause.
 And
 that
 is
 different


than
 than
 in
 the
 past.
 And
 you
 can
 say


that's
 because
 of
 hyperartisanship
 and


polarization,
 but
 it's
 also
 because
 of


another
 thing.
 It's
 because
 the


Democrats
 have
 become
 a
 party
 of


radicalism
 and
 extremism.
 And
 the


viewpoints
 that
 they
 expressed
 through


their
 aesthetics
 the
 other
 night,
 they


do
 express
 those
 things
 in
 policy
 and
 in


speeches
 all
 the
 time.
 So
 it's
 not
 just


like
 a
 oneoff
 or
 you
 know
 somehow
 like


we
 have
 a
 misconception
 of
 who
 these


guys
 are.
 I
 think
 you
 know
 the
 big
 line


of
 the
 night
 was
 when
 Trump
 just
 sort
 of


said
 these
 people
 are
 crazy.
 I
 mean
 he


said
 it
 in
 like
 almost
 mournful
 and


regretful
 way.
 He
 doesn't
 want
 them
 to


be
 crazy.
 He
 wants
 them
 to
 be
 rational


so
 he
 can
 work
 with
 them.
 I
 mean,


>> but
 I
 think
 that
 point
 re
 I'll
 I'll


still
 point
 the
 other
 side,
 which
 is


this
 has
 been
 going
 on
 for
 a
 couple
 of,


>> you
 know,
 state
 of
 the
 unions
 here


across
 this.
 The
 Republicans
 didn't


stand
 for
 the
 Democrats
 often
 and
 uh


it's
 a
 bit
 of
 showmanship.
 But
 the
 truth


is
 Trump
 is
 the
 divider
 and
 chief
 chief.


He
 always
 is
 attacking
 people.
 He's


always
 mocking
 people.
 So,
 they
 don't


want
 to
 play
 ball
 with
 him.
 So,
 I
 do


think
 you
 can
 both
 choice
 in
 politics.


You
 got
 to
 counter
 punch.


>> Uh
 no,
 I
 don't
 think
 so.
 That's
 actually


the
 that's
 actually
 the
 problem
 with
 the


that
 philosophy,
 Trump's
 philosophy
 of


we
 have
 to
 counter
 punch,
 we
 have
 to


attack,
 we
 never
 have
 to
 apologize,
 we


never
 have
 to
 be
 reasonable.
 That's
 part


of
 what's
 broken
 down
 in
 our
 politics


and
 these
 two
 sides
 should
 work


together.
 We
 should
 go
 back
 to
 a


bipartisan.


>> Are
 you
 going
 to
 work
 with
 Helen
 Omar


when
 he
 is
 when
 the
 president
 going
 to


be
 easy,
 but
 she
 is
 the
 mirror.
 Hold
 on,


I'll
 finish
 my
 statement.
 You
 asked
 a


question.
 I
 think
 Trump
 is
 the
 mirror
 of


that.
 He
 has
 been
 hostile
 towards
 these


Democrat.
 He
 doesn't
 give
 them
 an
 inch.


they
 should
 be
 more
 collaborative.
 That


that's
 what
 the
 balance
 of
 power
 between


the
 executive
 branch,
 you
 know,
 and
 and


these
 uh
 you
 know,
 congressmen
 and
 and


the
 Congress
 and
 the
 Senate.
 Like
 this


is
 how
 it's
 supposed
 to
 work.
 And
 these


two
 sides
 need
 to
 learn
 how
 to
 get
 back


to
 listening
 to
 each
 other,


understanding
 each
 other's
 positions,


and
 then
 finding
 a
 middle
 ground.
 And


that's
 why
 the
 Democrats
 lost
 last
 time


because
 they
 didn't
 have
 the
 common


sense
 to
 say,
 "Hey,
 everybody
 wants
 the


border
 closed."
 To
 your
 point,
 it's
 a


90%
 issue.
 and
 Kla
 Harris
 was
 too
 dumb


to
 just
 say,
 "Yeah,
 we
 should
 have


closed
 the
 border.
 It's
 closed
 now."
 And


uh
 we've
 got
 it.
 Anyway,
 the
 whole
 thing


is
 a
 mess.
 I
 understand
 you
 got
 to
 fight


for
 your
 team.
 I
 don't
 like
 the


>> count.
 You
 just
 actually
 made
 the
 key


point.
 You
 made
 the
 key
 point
 which
 is


underlying
 the
 optics
 and
 the


polarization.
 You
 have
 issues
 and
 on


those
 issues,
 President
 Trump
 is
 on
 the


side
 of
 the
 American
 people.
 the
 issues


where
 80%
 of
 the
 American
 people
 agree.


Some
 huge
 percentage,
 I
 don't
 know


exactly
 what
 it
 is,
 thinks
 that
 the


Somali
 daycare
 fraud
 in
 Minnesota
 was
 an


outrage.
 And
 the
 president
 is
 right
 to


point
 that
 out.
 And
 what's
 the


Democrat's
 reaction?
 You've
 got
 Ilan


Omar
 screaming
 from
 the
 audience
 at
 him.


>> Yeah,
 she's
 alone.
 I
 mean,
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 Democrats
 are
 not
 that
 different.


You
 did
 have
 you
 did
 have
 Elizabeth


Warren
 stand
 for
 uh
 stopping
 Nancy


Pelosi
 from
 trading
 stocks
 and
 that
 gave


Trump
 his
 best
 oneliner
 of
 the
 night.


That
 was
 his
 best
 oneliner
 clearly
 and


they
 stood
 for
 Iran
 too
 and
 stopping


Iran
 from
 being
 a
 nuclear.


>> I
 give
 Elizabeth
 Warren
 credit
 for
 that.


>> There
 you
 go.
 You
 don't
 have
 to
 punch


her
 back.


>> Stop
 insider
 trading
 act
 without
 delay.


>> Yeah.
 See,
 that's
 something
 bipartisan.


Look
 at
 that,
 Zach.
 That's
 what
 you
 need


to
 get
 the
 country
 back
 to.
 But
 that


hold
 on.
 But
 this
 this
 disproves
 the


point
 you
 were
 making
 before.
 You
 said


that
 it
 was
 polarization.


>> You
 stood
 up
 for
 that.
 I
 can't
 believe


>> can't
 believe
 Nancy
 Pelosi
 stand
 up
 if


she
 sing
 pal.
 Good
 job.


>> That's
 why
 he's
 so
 good
 is
 he's
 in
 the


moment
 and
 he's
 reacting
 to
 what's


happening
 in
 the
 chamber.
 He's
 not
 good.


He's
 not
 just
 reading
 from
 a


teleprompter.
 And
 he
 nailed
 it.
 But


look,
 that
 moment
 disproves
 what
 you


were
 saying,
 Jal,
 because
 this
 is
 not


just
 about
 polarization.
 On
 that
 issue,


Elizabeth
 Warren
 was
 willing
 to
 stand


because
 she
 actually,
 to
 her
 credit,


wants
 to
 ban
 insider
 trading
 by
 members


of
 Congress.
 Yes.
 But
 on
 the
 rest
 of


those
 issues,
 like
 securing
 the
 border,


she
 did
 not
 stand.
 Why?
 Because
 she
 does


not
 agree
 with
 the
 president
 on
 that


issue.


>> We
 just
 have
 to
 get
 back
 to
 these
 sides


working
 together.
 That's
 my
 personal


feeling.


uh
 Freeberg,
 any
 thoughts
 on
 the
 uh


theatrics
 and
 uh
 Trump's
 first
 year
 at


large
 and
 you
 know
 the
 sort
 of
 back
 and


forth
 and
 is
 there
 any
 hope
 that
 these


two
 teams
 could
 collaborate
 at
 some


point
 on
 something
 like
 say
 the


ballooning
 deficit
 which
 Trump
 has
 not


gotten
 under
 control
 in
 his
 first
 year


and
 it's
 going to
 be
 $2.5
 trillion


dollars
 added.
 What
 are
 your
 thoughts


here
 on
 them
 collaborating
 on
 anything


important?
 Friedberg,
 that's
 probably


one
 thing
 they
 can
 agree
 on
 is
 just
 keep


the
 money
 flowing.
 Got
 it.
 They'll
 both


give
 a
 They'll
 both
 give
 a
 a
 standing


ovation
 for
 burn
 more
 capital
 and
 put
 us


more
 in
 debt.
 Well
 said
 my
 guy
 David


Friedberg,
 sultpan
 of
 science,
 it
 is


your
 time
 to
 shine.
 The
 world's
 greatest


moderator
 has
 decided
 we're
 going


directly
 to
 science
 corner.
 This
 is
 your


time
 to
 shine.


>> Sax's
 time
 to
 drop
 a
 deuce.


>> Sax
 went
 immediately
 off
 camera.


>> Yeah,
 he
 has
 to
 drop
 a
 deuce.


>> What's
 up?


>> But
 what
 do
 you
 need
 me
 for?
 This
 is


very
 important
 for
 you.


>> Freeberg's
 going
 to
 talk.


>> Lightning
 round
 for
 science
 corner.
 Go


Freeberg.


>> Wait,
 wait,
 wait.
 Are
 we
 doing
 any
 more


topics
 after
 this
 or
 can
 I
 just
 leave?


>> Yes,
 tariffs.


>> Yes,
 we're
 doing
 tariffs.


>> Wait,
 why
 would
 we
 do
 that?


>> Because
 I
 want
 to
 get
 the
 audience
 to


sleep.
 I'm
 not
 saying
 Science
 Corner


doesn't
 have
 its
 audience.


>> Listen,
 you
 can
 go.


>> Why
 wouldn't
 we
 do
 Yeah,
 exactly.
 You're


screaming.


>> Let
 him
 do
 his
 work.


>> Let
 him
 let
 him
 cook.
 Let
 him
 cook.


>> Freeberg,
 tell
 us
 about
 this
 Harvard


scene.


>> Speaking
 of
 science,
 I
 think
 that


there's
 a
 very
 important
 moment


happening
 right
 now.
 We've
 talked
 a


number
 of
 times
 on
 the
 show
 about


Yamanaka
 factors.
 These
 are
 these
 four


proteins
 that
 were
 discovered
 by
 Shina


Yamanaka
 that
 we
 found
 later
 that
 when


applied
 to
 cells,
 mamalian
 cells
 can


actually
 reverse
 the
 age
 of
 those
 cells,


reset
 the
 epigenetic
 clock,
 reset
 the


epiggenome,
 which
 is
 the
 little
 markers


on
 top
 of
 the
 DNA
 that
 turn
 genes
 on
 and


off
 back
 to
 a
 youthful
 state.


extraordinary
 groundbreaking
 work
 that


was
 done
 that
 won
 the
 Nobel
 Prize
 led
 to


the
 foundation
 of
 several
 companies.


There's
 a
 Harvard
 uh
 scientist
 named


David
 Sinclair.
 He's
 a
 bit
 of
 a


controversial
 character.
 Do
 you
 guys


know
 him?
 I
 think
 you
 guys
 one
 one
 or


two
 of
 you
 may
 have
 met
 him.
 Chim,
 you


ever
 met
 him?


>> I
 I
 I
 followed
 him.
 I've
 seen
 his
 stuff.


So
 Sinclair
 is
 kind
 of
 bemoaned
 a
 little


bit
 by
 the
 scientific
 and
 academic


community
 for
 being
 a
 little
 too


overhypy
 snake
 oil
 salesman
 as
 some
 of


folks
 have
 claimed
 because
 years
 ago
 he


sold
 a
 company
 to
 GSK
 saying
 resveratrol


would
 reverse
 aging
 and
 you
 know
 he
 made


$720
 million
 on
 that
 and
 it
 didn't
 end


up
 working
 and
 he's
 promoted
 certain


supplement
 companies
 and
 so
 on.
 So,
 I


want
 to
 preface
 with
 that
 before
 I
 kind


of
 underwrite
 what
 he's
 saying
 with
 this


next
 thing,
 but
 he's
 a
 co-founder
 of
 a


company
 called
 Life
 Biosciences,
 and


they've
 reached
 a
 major
 agreement
 with


the
 FDA
 to
 be
 the
 first
 company
 to
 treat


humans
 with
 Yamanaka
 factors.


Specifically,
 what
 they're
 doing
 is


they're
 going
 to
 be
 delivering
 these


Yamanaka
 factors,
 these
 are
 these


proteins


that
 rejuvenate
 cells
 and
 make
 them


youthful
 again
 into
 the
 eye.
 And
 so


their
 their
 first
 indication
 is
 to


actually
 inject
 them
 into
 the
 vitrial


fluid
 in
 the
 eyeball
 and
 they'll
 affect


the
 retina
 in
 the
 eye
 to
 address
 people


that
 have
 gotten
 blind
 from
 glaucoma
 or


one
 of
 these
 kind
 of
 stroke
 like


diseases
 that
 happen
 in
 the
 eye.
 And
 the


expectation
 with
 this
 phase
 one
 clinical


trial
 is
 that
 the
 delivery
 of
 these


Yamanaka
 factors
 into
 the
 eye
 will


rejuvenate
 the
 retina,
 make
 it
 youthful


again,
 and
 restore
 vision.
 If
 it
 works,


which
 it's
 expected
 to
 because
 we
 see


this
 result
 happen
 in
 animal
 models,
 it


could
 be
 an
 extraordinary
 breakthrough,


not
 just
 in
 terms
 of
 blindness,
 but
 in


terms
 of
 the
 first
 human
 application
 of


Yamanaka
 factors
 to
 reverse
 aging.
 The


way
 they're
 doing
 it
 is
 they're
 actually


packaging
 up
 DNA
 that
 will
 make
 these


proteins
 into
 viruses,
 AAV
 virus
 that
 is


delivered
 into
 the
 eye.
 The
 virus
 will


then
 go
 into
 the
 retinal
 cells
 and
 then


will
 deliver
 this
 payload
 for
 this
 DNA


to
 make
 these
 proteins
 in
 the
 eye
 uh


cells
 and
 it
 can
 be
 turned
 on
 and
 off.


Amazingly
 they've
 created
 a
 switch


mechanism
 in
 it
 where
 the
 protein


production
 the
 production
 of
 these


Yamanaka
 factors
 can
 be
 turned
 on
 and


off
 by
 taking
 an
 antibiotic
 called


doxycyc.
 So
 the
 person
 that
 gets
 the


delivery
 of
 this
 drug
 takes
 the


antibiotic
 turns
 on
 the
 production
 of


these
 Yamanaka
 factors
 and
 then


theoretically
 their
 eye
 cells
 will
 deage


will
 get
 youthful
 and
 their
 vision
 will


be
 restored.
 So
 phase
 one
 clinical


trials
 underway.
 First
 time
 in
 human


history
 we're
 seeing
 Yamanaka
 factors


being
 delivered
 into
 humans.
 Literally


the
 tip
 of
 the
 iceberg.
 There
 are
 now


over
 a
 dozen
 startups
 that
 are
 trying
 to


deliver
 Yamanaka
 factors
 which
 are
 these


proteins
 or
 some
 other
 sort
 of
 protein


that
 can
 actually
 reverse
 aging
 by


restoring
 the
 epiggenome
 and
 cells
 and


make
 them
 young
 again.
 So
 this
 is
 the


beginning
 of
 a
 wave
 of
 what
 I
 think
 will


be
 the
 most
 extraordinary
 revolution
 in


human
 therapeutics
 and
 ultimately
 could


lead
 to


you
 know
 some
 people
 would
 argue
 the


fountain
 of
 youth.
 Is
 this
 just
 a
 talk


study?
 So
 is
 it
 mechanism?


>> They're
 not.
 Yeah,
 they're
 they're
 well


they'll
 see
 results.
 They'll
 see


results,
 but
 they're
 going
 to
 they're


going
 to
 keep
 dosing
 low.
 But
 you
 will


see
 results.


>> God,
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 incredible.


>> It's
 going
 to
 be
 incredible.
 By
 the
 way,


the
 number
 of
 other
 folks
 that
 are


gearing
 up
 for
 phase
 one
 using
 if
 not


the
 Yamanaka
 factors,
 other
 factors
 that


they've
 identified
 or
 designed
 as
 an


alternative
 to
 Yamanaka
 factors
 again
 to


rejuvenate
 the
 cells.
 And
 just
 to
 remind


folks,
 the
 way
 this
 works
 is
 it
 was


discovered
 that
 these
 proteins
 when
 they


go
 into
 a
 cell,
 they
 take
 all
 of
 those


little
 markers
 that
 sit
 on
 top
 of
 your


DNA
 that
 turn
 genes
 on
 and
 off
 and
 they


create
 a
 system
 that
 causes
 them
 all
 to


move
 to
 the
 right
 place.
 So,
 it
 resets


the
 markers
 so
 that
 those
 cells
 will


start
 to
 operate
 like
 they're
 supposed


to
 when
 they
 were
 young
 again.


>> That's
 going
 to
 be


>> it's
 going
 to
 be
 incredible.
 Yeah.
 Do


you
 think
 like
 No,
 in
 all
 seriousness,


people's
 knees
 or
 joints
 or
 what
 where


do
 you
 think
 it
 could
 flow
 to
 next
 in


arthritis?


>> Yep.
 Um
 and
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 when
 applied


and
 if
 it's
 distributed
 in
 the
 skin,


they've
 seen
 some
 results
 in
 monkeys


where
 like
 wrinkles
 go
 away.


>> It
 like
 literally
 makes
 these
 cells
 all


work
 youthful
 again.
 And
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 the


damage
 that
 happens
 over
 time
 is
 not


damage
 to
 DNA.
 It's
 damage
 to
 the


epiggenome.
 It's
 the
 parts
 that
 sit
 on


top
 of
 the
 DNA
 that
 turn
 genes
 on
 and


off.
 And
 they
 get
 moved
 to
 the
 wrong


place
 as
 you
 get
 older.
 And
 by
 resetting


them
 and
 getting
 them
 back
 to
 the
 right


place,
 boom,
 the
 cell
 is
 young
 again,


the
 organ
 is
 young
 again,
 and
 suddenly


you
 look
 and
 act
 and
 feel
 young
 again.


It's
 an
 incredible
 technology.
 We're


just
 at
 the
 early
 stages,
 the
 early


innings
 of
 turning
 it
 into
 therapeutics.


Again,
 the
 discovery
 goes
 back
 to
 2006


and
 now
 we're
 starting
 to
 see
 it
 get


into
 clinic.


>> All
 right,
 let's
 rejuvenate.
 Let's


rejuvenate
 some
 hairlines
 on
 this


podcast.
 Uh,
 that
 would
 be
 next
 up.


>> Speak
 for
 yourself.


>> I
 don't know.
 You
 got
 You
 got
 a
 little


uh
 You
 got
 a
 little
 peaks
 going
 there,


my
 brother.
 A
 little
 peak.


>> What
 are
 you
 talking
 about,
 bro?
 My


hairline's
 incredible.
 I'm
 50.


>> I
 mean,
 it's
 not
 bad
 for
 50.
 I
 give
 you


credit.
 You're
 You're
 holding
 your
 own.


All
 right,
 let's
 talk
 about
 our
 final


topic.
 Scotas
 struck
 down
 Trump's


emergency
 powers
 tariffs.
 Last
 Friday,


Scotas
 voted
 63
 against
 President


Trump's
 tariffs.
 Six
 judges
 voted


against.
 three
 conservatives,
 Roberts,


Barrett,
 Gorsuch,
 uh,
 and
 three
 liberals


via
 Bloomberg.
 This
 is
 the
 biggest


rebuke
 of
 existing
 executive
 policy
 in


91
 years
 since
 Scottish
 struck
 down


FDR's
 first
 new
 deal
 in
 1935.


UPUP
 Wharton
 Analysis
 says
 the
 tariffs


collected
 about
 175
 billion
 to
 date,
 50%


of
 all
 tariff
 duties,
 um,
 might
 wind
 up


being
 refunded.
 This
 is
 going
 to
 take


some
 time
 to
 sort
 out
 in
 the
 courts.


2,000
 importers
 have
 already
 filed
 for


refunds.
 We
 we
 talked
 about
 it
 here.
 I


think
 the
 majority
 of
 people
 felt
 like


this
 is
 the
 way
 the
 decision
 would
 go.


And
 we
 talked
 about
 here
 that
 there
 were


other
 options
 for
 President
 Trump
 to


pursue.
 He
 immediately
 said
 he
 was
 not


deterred
 and
 invoked
 a
 15%
 global
 tariff


across
 the
 board
 via
 section
 122
 of
 the


1974


trade
 act.
 Here's
 your
 poly
 market.
 Will


the
 court
 force
 Trump
 to
 refund
 tariffs?


18%
 chance
 but
 spike
 to
 40%
 after
 the


SCOTA's
 decision.
 How
 will
 Congress


react?
 Poly
 market
 says
 3%
 chance.


Congress
 passes
 any
 tariffs
 by
 March


31st.
 So
 again,
 as
 I
 referenced
 earlier,


these
 two
 sides
 just
 can't
 seem
 to
 work


together.
 And
 that
 would
 have
 resolved


the
 whole
 thing.
 Saxs,
 you
 want
 to
 um


give
 us
 your
 take
 here?


>> First
 of
 all,
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 the


tariffs
 are
 going
 away.
 What
 the
 court


basically
 indicated
 especially
 the


70page
 Kavanaaugh
 descent
 is
 that


there's
 multiple
 alternative
 bases
 in


law
 for
 the
 tariffs
 in
 existing
 law.
 So


for
 example
 section
 122
 of
 the
 trade
 act


of
 1974


enables
 temporary
 150day
 tariffs
 of
 up


to
 15%
 to
 address
 balance
 of
 payments


issues
 and
 the
 president
 has
 already


invoked
 this.
 So
 we
 are
 now
 operating


under
 that.
 What
 the
 150
 days
 is
 going


to
 do
 is
 buy
 the
 administration
 time
 to


substantiate
 via
 studies
 and
 agency


reviews.
 What
 it
 needs
 to
 prove
 in
 order


to
 invoke
 more
 sweeping
 tariff
 authority


under
 section
 301
 of
 the
 trade
 act
 and


under
 section
 338
 of
 the
 tariff
 act.


Section
 301
 authorizes
 tariffs


responding
 to
 unfair
 foreign
 trade


practices.
 Section
 338
 of
 the
 tariff
 act


allows
 tariffs
 against
 countries


discriminating
 against
 US
 commerce.
 The


Kavanaaugh
 descent
 actually
 provided
 a


roadmap
 for
 the
 administration
 to
 put
 in


place
 tariffs
 using
 one
 of
 these


alternate
 uh
 bases.
 So,
 I
 think
 that
 one


way
 or
 another,
 the
 tariff
 policies
 of


this
 administration
 and
 the
 favorable


trade
 deals
 that
 they
 allow
 us
 to
 strike


with
 many
 nations,
 they
 will
 continue.


And
 I
 think
 the
 court
 seems
 to
 know
 that


because
 the
 majority's
 opinion
 as


concurrences
 collectively
 said
 nothing


about
 how
 the
 administration
 should
 go


about
 refunding
 the
 tariff
 revenue


already
 collected.
 I
 think
 that
 if
 they


expected
 this
 decision
 to
 end
 the
 tariff


policies
 altogether,
 they
 probably
 would


have
 said
 something
 about
 that.
 And
 I


think
 that
 brings
 up
 a
 really
 important


point
 just
 on
 the
 merits
 here,
 which
 is


why
 would
 we
 want
 to
 give
 back
 hundreds


of
 billions
 of
 dollars
 to
 a
 bunch
 of


importers
 when
 we're
 trillions
 of


dollars
 in
 debt?
 And
 I'll
 just
 say
 that


the
 people
 who
 originally
 predicted
 that


somehow
 these
 tariffs
 would
 be


catastrophic
 for
 the
 economy.
 Those


predictions
 all
 prove
 not
 to
 be
 true.
 So


I
 think
 that
 this
 is
 ultimately,
 I


think,
 going
 to
 be
 a
 popular
 policy.
 The


administration
 will
 figure
 out
 a


different
 way
 to
 do
 it.
 And
 I
 predict


that
 future
 administrations,
 whether


they're
 Republican
 or
 Democrat,
 will


keep
 some
 version
 of
 the
 tariffs
 in


place,
 but
 I
 think
 that
 they
 will
 be


ultimately
 popular
 on
 a
 long-standing


basis.
 Chamathy,
 your
 thoughts?


>> I
 think
 we've
 proven
 the
 experiment
 has


been
 successful.


>> What
 was
 the
 experiment?


We
 needed
 to
 smoke
 out
 what
 the
 right


balance
 of
 trade
 should
 be
 between
 the


United
 States
 and
 all
 of
 its
 partner


countries.
 I
 think
 that
 what
 we


uncovered
 is
 that
 for
 the
 most
 part
 they


were
 structural
 imbalances
 that
 were


made
 not
 because
 they
 made
 economic


sense
 for
 America,
 but
 it
 was
 just
 part


of
 a
 hodgepodge
 of
 globalist
 dril
 that


people
 just
 bought
 into.
 And
 if
 you


strip
 all
 that
 stuff
 away,
 we
 had
 a


hollowedout
 manufacturing
 class
 and
 we


have
 a
 hollowedout
 middle
 class
 and
 the


tariffs
 will
 create
 more
 equality
 for


the
 American
 worker
 in
 the
 end.
 So
 now
 I


think
 the
 debate
 should
 be
 about
 how
 to


implement
 these
 in
 a
 structural
 and


permanent
 way.


I
 think
 we
 talked
 about
 this
 before


Jason
 that
 this
 was
 sort
 of
 expected
 and


>> there
 are
 many
 other
 mechanisms.
 I
 think


the
 president
 activated
 one
 of
 them


immediately.


>> I
 don't
 think
 this
 is
 going
 away
 and
 I


don't
 think
 it
 should
 go
 away.
 So
 I


think
 now
 the
 point
 is


Congress
 really
 should
 ratify
 these


things
 because
 it
 is
 clear
 that
 it
 was


the
 right
 thing
 to
 do


and
 if
 they
 don't
 then
 you
 know
 the


president
 still
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 room
 to
 get


these
 done
 but
 these
 make
 smart
 economic


sense
 in
 my
 opinion.


>> Freeberg
 any
 thoughts
 on
 the
 ruling?


Does
 it
 give
 you


some
 I
 don't
 know
 um
 respect
 for
 the


courts
 that
 they
 made
 a
 judgment
 not


along
 party
 lines
 for
 once?
 Uh
 does
 it


Yeah.
 Okay.
 Exactly.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 I
 think
 that
 all
 I


think
 all
 Americans


should
 feel
 assured
 and
 comforted
 in
 the


fact
 that
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 view


the
 Supreme
 Court
 as
 having
 a
 high


degree
 of
 partisanship.


The
 fact
 that
 the
 president
 despite


having
 a
 majority
 of
 what
 others
 would


think
 were
 kind
 of
 politically
 aligned


appointees
 on
 the
 court
 had
 a
 ruling


that
 he
 did
 not
 want.


I
 think
 should
 give
 everyone
 good
 faith


that
 the
 system
 that
 the
 founders
 set
 up


is
 working
 that
 there
 is
 a
 judicial


branch
 that
 adjudicates
 the
 law
 against


the
 executive
 branch
 when
 they
 think


that
 um
 it
 doesn't
 map
 and
 I
 think
 that


that
 was
 very
 important
 to
 see.
 So,
 you


know,
 I
 clearly
 you
 the
 the
 debate
 about


tariffs,
 the
 economic
 effect
 of
 tariffs,


the
 security
 structural
 trade


relationship
 effect
 of
 tariffs
 and
 the


importance
 of
 that
 is
 a
 separate


conversation,
 but
 I
 do
 think
 that
 the


read
 of
 the
 law
 being
 what
 I
 would
 say


is
 nonpartisan
 with
 respect
 to
 the


court's
 action
 is
 important
 and
 probably


very
 valuable.
 I'll
 reiterate
 that
 this


is
 a
 great
 moment,
 I
 think,
 for
 uh
 the


Supreme
 Court
 to
 make
 a
 thoughtful


decision.
 And
 I
 think
 we
 need
 to
 think


about
 executive
 power
 a
 whole
 bunch.


Whether
 it's
 Biden
 with
 student
 loans
 or


Trump
 with
 tariffs,
 we
 have
 this


beautiful
 system
 set
 up
 by
 the
 founding


fathers.
 I
 know
 it's
 frustrating.


Gridlock's
 frustrating.
 Having
 to
 work


together
 is
 frustrating.
 Trust
 me,
 we
 we


all
 come
 to
 this
 podcast
 every
 Thursday.


We
 have
 to
 work
 together.
 It's
 hard
 to


work
 together.
 You
 got
 to
 learn
 to
 work


together.
 And
 we
 don't
 want
 an
 executive


branch
 that
 can
 unilaterally
 just
 roll


over
 the
 other
 branches.
 And
 uh
 that's


going
 to
 end.
 I
 think
 Trump's
 going
 to


lose
 the
 midterms
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 get


to
 more
 chaos
 again
 and
 it
 we
 might
 as


well
 start
 this
 reconciliation
 process


of
 these
 two
 sides
 stopping
 their
 law


for
 against
 each
 other
 and
 working


together
 for
 the
 American
 people
 on
 the


important
 issues.
 The
 tariffs
 there
 are


some
 fundamentally
 important
 things
 that


Trump
 was
 doing
 there
 and
 they
 were


working.
 They
 could
 have
 been
 chaotic.


uh
 that's
 a
 reasonable
 um
 you
 know


criticism
 of
 them
 because
 business


owners
 didn't
 know
 what
 to
 do.
 So
 Trump


did
 it
 in
 a
 chaotic
 way.
 That's
 just
 a


fact.
 He
 should
 have
 done
 it
 in
 a
 more


thoughtful
 way
 and
 the
 Congress
 should


have
 been
 alongside
 him
 saying,
 "Hey,


what
 tools
 do
 you
 need?
 How
 can
 we
 help


support
 this?
 We
 know
 that
 there's
 trade


imbalances.
 We
 know
 that
 people
 are


being
 unfair.
 Let's
 work
 together
 as
 one


America
 to
 negotiate
 these
 things."
 So


both
 sides
 start
 having
 dinner
 together,


start
 playing
 cards
 together,
 and
 do


what
 we
 do
 here
 on
 this
 podcast,
 which


is
 you
 fight
 it
 out.
 You
 argue,
 but
 then


you
 come
 together
 and
 try
 to
 find
 some


resolutions
 for
 this
 stuff.
 So
 they


should
 go
 and
 tell
 Trump,
 "Hey,
 we'll


approve
 all
 the
 tariffs
 you
 did.
 We
 will


not
 force
 you
 to
 get
 refunds."
 The


Congress
 should
 come
 out
 and
 just
 say


that.
 And
 then
 they
 should
 say,
 "Hey,


and
 when
 you
 want
 to
 do
 them
 in
 2026,


just
 run
 them
 by
 us
 or
 ask
 us
 for
 some


parameters
 that
 you
 want
 and
 let's
 just


be
 thoughtful
 about
 it.
 These
 are
 our


concerns.
 That's
 it.
 Thank
 you
 for


coming
 to
 my
 TEA
 talk.
 Can


>> I
 just
 do
 one?


>> Absolutely.
 I'm
 sure
 you
 have
 some


debate
 club
 points
 that
 you
 want
 to


point
 that
 out.


>> Well,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 make
 one.
 I
 mean,


do
 you
 think
 Susan
 Rice
 is
 going
 to


respect
 your
 call
 for
 comedy
 and


basically
 working
 together
 Kumbaya?


>> I
 want
 the
 Aspree
 to
 corpse.
 No,
 I


don't.
 I
 think
 both
 sides.
 She
 just
 had


a
 diet
 tribe
 where
 she
 basically
 said


that
 Republicans
 and
 actually
 not
 just


like
 partisan
 Republicans,
 but
 even
 tech


companies
 that
 merely
 were
 working
 with


the
 administration
 should
 expect
 to
 get


prosecuted.
 I
 mean,
 she
 was
 basically


outright
 saying
 she's
 she
 and
 the


Democrats
 are
 going
 to
 pursue
 lawfare
 as


soon
 as
 they
 get
 back
 in
 charge.


>> They're
 they're
 absolutely
 going
 to
 do


that.
 Just
 like
 when
 Trump
 got
 in,
 he


went
 after
 Comey,
 he
 went
 after
 Jerome


Pal.
 The
 lawfare
 is
 happening
 on
 both


sides.
 Both
 sides
 need
 to
 drop
 the


lawfare.
 We
 need
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 these


pardons.
 They're
 ridiculous.
 And
 these


team
 this,
 we
 have
 to
 be
 a
 team.
 So,


let's
 just
 get
 some
 aspa
 of
 corpse
 and


teamwork
 going
 in
 Washington
 DC.
 And


that's
 what
 we
 should
 vote
 for
 in
 the


midterms.
 We
 should
 vote
 for
 moderates


who
 want
 to
 work
 together.
 And
 in
 2028,


we
 should
 have
 some
 kind
 of
 moderates


and
 tickets
 that
 want
 to
 work
 together.


That
 would
 be
 better
 for
 all
 Americans.


This
 kind
 of
 chaos
 is
 not
 good,
 folks.


All
 right.
