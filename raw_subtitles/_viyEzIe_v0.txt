>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 OddLotss
 podcast.
 I'm
 Joe
 Weisenthal


>> and
 I'm
 Tracy
 Aloway.


>> Tracy,
 you
 know,
 we're
 several
 months,
 I


guess
 like
 five
 months
 or
 so,
 recording


this
 September
 16th.
 5
 months
 or
 so


since
 liberation
 day,
 since
 the
 uh
 trade


war
 started.


>> By
 and
 large,


>> the
 world
 is
 still
 kind
 of
 working,


right?
 You
 could
 see
 its
 effects
 for


sure
 in
 certain
 categories
 and
 so
 forth,


but
 by
 and
 large,
 I
 don't
 think
 the


contours
 of
 the
 economy
 look
 that
 much


different
 than
 they
 did
 say
 in
 March
 or


April.


>> Look,
 I'm
 still
 missing
 my
 auction
 item


that's
 supposed
 to
 be
 mailed
 from
 the


Netherlands.
 So,
 it
 has
 affected
 me


directly.


>> Wait,
 what
 happened
 with
 it?
 Wait,
 wait.


Say
 more.
 Say
 more
 about
 So,
 I
 I
 won


something
 from
 a
 Dutch
 auction
 house
 and


um
 they
 were
 supposed
 to
 mail
 it


in-house
 shipping
 and
 instead
 of
 mailing


it,
 they
 sent
 out
 an
 email
 saying
 that


they
 can't
 mail
 it
 because
 everyone's


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 the
 new
 tariff


schedule
 and
 customs
 and
 things
 like


that.
 I
 still
 haven't
 heard
 from
 them,


>> but
 it
 still
 feels
 like
 something


happened.
 There
 was
 some
 sort
 of


rupture.
 kind
 of
 hard
 to
 imagine
 going


to
 a
 March
 2025
 world
 again,
 but
 also


hard
 to
 imagine
 going
 to
 a
 pre-Trump
 one


world
 ever.
 Like,
 it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to


imagine
 that
 in
 my
 lifetime
 that
 there


will
 ever
 be
 a
 sort
 of
 2015
 style


trading
 relationship
 between
 the
 US
 and


China.


>> I
 could
 be
 wrong.


>> Never
 say
 never,
 but


>> it's
 just
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 see
 at
 this


point.


>> At
 this
 point,
 like
 it's
 not
 a
 single


administration
 thing,
 right?
 We've
 had


Trump
 1.0


And
 then
 Biden
 continued
 a
 lot
 of
 the


tariffs
 and
 even
 added
 some
 new
 ones.


And
 then
 we
 have
 Trump
 2.0
 which
 is


arguably
 going
 even
 harder
 on
 China.
 So


it
 does
 seem
 like
 at least
 a
 durable


trend,
 not
 a
 flash
 in
 the
 pan.


>> And
 as
 we've
 discussed,
 you
 mentioned


the
 fact
 that
 Biden
 was
 a
 continuation


arguably
 an
 expansion
 of
 Trump
 won


particularly
 with
 some
 of
 the
 export


restrictions
 on
 technology.


Um,
 yeah,
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 rare
 trade


rethinking
 the
 global
 trading
 system,


whatever
 that
 means,
 is
 one
 of
 the
 rare


areas
 of
 bipartisan
 consensus
 in
 DC
 as


has
 come
 up
 in
 many
 episodes.


>> Yeah,
 that
 and
 housing


>> uh
 that
 and
 housing,
 right?
 That
 housing


is
 very
 expensive.
 We
 really
 do
 have
 the


perfect
 guest.
 Someone
 who
 has
 a
 very


big
 picture
 view
 on
 trade.
 Someone
 who


has
 been
 directly
 involved
 in
 trade


negotiations.
 Someone
 who
 remembers
 the


sort
 of
 pre-Trump
 one


>> the
 long
 long long
 ago


>> the
 long
 long long
 ago
 global
 trading


system
 and
 uh
 who
 could
 talk
 about


whatever
 remnants
 of
 that
 are
 left
 or


even
 maybe
 who
 can
 explain
 to
 me
 what


the
 global
 trading
 system
 was.
 We're


going
 to
 be
 speaking
 with
 Michael


Froman.
 is
 the
 president
 of
 the
 council


on
 foreign
 relations
 and
 he
 was
 the


former
 US
 trade
 representative
 during


the
 Obama
 uh
 Obama
 2
 administration
 2013


to
 2017
 has
 continued
 to
 write
 a
 lot


about
 this
 topic
 so
 uh
 Michael
 Frman


thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 uh
 coming
 on


outlaws
 thrilled
 to
 have


>> thanks
 for
 having
 me


>> absolutely
 what
 does
 the
 US
 trade


representative
 do
 you
 you
 had
 that
 job
 I


actually
 realize
 I
 don't
 really
 know


>> like
 it's
 fine
 it's
 a
 great
 job
 um
 uh
 it


really
 has
 the
 function
 of
 negotiating


trade
 agreements
 okay
 um
 and
 enforcing


US
 trade
 rights
 under
 previous


agreements.
 Um
 the
 reason
 I
 love
 the
 job


is
 that
 it
 combines
 high
 diplomacy,


sitting
 down
 with
 ministers,
 presidents,


prime
 ministers
 of
 other
 countries


trying
 to
 reach
 agreements
 with
 having


to
 have
 a
 really
 detailed
 understanding


of
 elements
 of
 the
 US
 economy.
 I
 mean,
 I


learned
 more
 from
 American
 farmers


teaching
 me
 the
 500
 things
 you
 can
 do


with
 a
 molecule
 of
 milk
 and
 how
 they


manipulate
 a
 molecule
 of
 milk
 to
 to


circumvent
 trade
 restrictions
 and
 get


around
 tariffs.
 You
 export
 it
 as
 butter


or
 as
 whey
 or
 as
 low
 calorie
 powder
 or


whatever.


>> This
 is
 a
 whole
 episode,
 right?


>> A
 whole
 episode
 right
 there.
 But
 that's


only
 one
 example
 of
 of
 the
 literally


thousands
 of
 issues
 you
 have
 to
 learn
 as


US
 trade
 rep
 to
 be
 able
 to
 sit
 down
 with


your
 counterparts
 in
 other
 countries
 and


negotiate
 agreements.


>> Can
 you
 give
 us
 an
 idea
 or
 a
 sense
 of


the
 average
 negotiation?
 What
 exactly
 is


the
 process?
 Like
 do
 you
 meet
 for
 the


first
 time
 in
 a
 designated
 room


somewhere
 or
 is
 there
 prep
 that
 goes


into
 these?
 You're
 exchanging
 emails.


What
 exactly
 happens?
 So
 in
 the
 in
 the


in
 the
 past
 and
 of
 course
 it's
 a
 very


different
 situation
 now
 but
 in
 the
 past


the
 US
 or
 another
 country
 might
 come
 up


with
 an
 idea
 of
 what
 they
 wanted
 to
 do


in
 a
 trade
 negotiation
 a
 set
 of
 issues


they
 wanted
 to
 take
 on
 a
 set
 of


countries
 they
 wanted
 to
 negotiate
 with


and
 they
 would
 go
 around
 and
 do


consultations
 with
 other
 countries
 float


the
 ideas
 see
 what
 kind
 of
 feedback
 they


got
 and
 scope
 out
 the
 nature
 of
 the


negotiation.
 Is
 it
 going
 to
 be
 just


about
 goods
 and
 tariffs?
 Is
 it
 going
 to


touch
 upon
 agriculture
 and
 regulations


and
 services
 and
 labor
 and
 environment


and
 all
 various
 other
 issues
 that
 have


become
 part
 of
 trade
 negotiations
 in
 the


past
 and
 get
 agreement
 by
 the
 other


countries
 that
 this
 was
 the
 agenda
 and


then
 in
 the
 past
 usually
 it's
 the
 US


that
 has
 been
 sort
 of
 driving
 the


agenda.
 These
 would
 be
 the
 topics
 we


would
 deal
 with.
 The
 US
 would
 come
 up


with
 proposals
 of
 what
 are
 the


disciplines
 that
 we
 would
 like
 to
 see
 in


each
 of
 these
 areas.
 What
 are
 the
 rules


that
 we'd
 like
 to
 see?
 And
 it
 was
 the


way
 the
 US
 brought
 other
 countries
 along


to
 adopt
 high
 standard
 rules
 across
 one


sector
 or
 one
 subject
 matter
 or
 or


another.
 And
 the
 idea
 was
 uh
 we
 know
 we


live
 in
 a
 high
 wage
 um
 highly
 regulated


economy.
 We
 compete
 with
 economies
 that


often
 times
 have
 lower
 wages,
 lower


regulation.
 And
 if
 we
 could
 raise
 other


count's
 standards
 closer
 to
 our
 own,
 it


would
 level
 the
 playing
 field
 for


American
 workers
 and
 farmers
 and


ranchers
 and
 make
 it
 easier
 for
 us
 to


compete.


>> I
 mean,
 for
 better
 or
 worse,
 it
 really


just
 seems
 like
 a
 totally
 different
 era.


Now,
 the
 idea
 of
 getting
 to
 the
 idea
 of


going
 back
 to
 some
 world
 where
 the
 US
 is


actively
 working
 with
 a
 bunch
 of
 country


on
 rules
 rather
 than
 rates,
 tariff,
 it


really
 does
 seem
 it
 seems
 like
 ancient


history.
 It
 just
 seems
 so
 right.


>> Look,
 I
 think
 that's
 right.
 First
 of


all,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 the
 the


international
 trading
 system
 had
 been


under
 stress
 for
 some
 time.
 President


Trump
 in
 some
 ways
 put
 was
 the
 final


nail
 in
 the
 in
 the
 coffin
 of
 it.
 But,


you
 know,
 the
 global
 multilateral


rulesbased
 system,
 that's
 like
 the
 WTO,


the
 World
 Trade
 Organization,
 where
 160


plus
 countries
 got
 together,
 agreed
 to
 a


set
 of
 rules,
 agreed
 to
 some
 mechanisms


for
 enforcing
 those
 rules
 and
 for


monitoring
 them.
 That's
 been
 under


stress
 for
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 There's
 been


dissatisfaction
 and
 I
 think
 now
 in
 fact


is
 you're
 you're
 right.
 I
 think
 we
 can't


go
 back
 to
 the
 way
 things
 were


pre-Trump.
 We're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 think


about
 what
 comes
 next.


>> Just
 to
 play
 devil's
 advocate
 for
 a


second,
 to
 what
 extent
 did
 we
 actually


have
 a
 rules-based
 trading
 system
 in
 the


sense
 that
 everyone
 was
 actually


beholdened
 to
 the
 same
 limitations
 or


the
 same
 rules?
 Because
 looking
 back,


there
 were
 always
 accusations
 about


China
 cheating
 or
 maybe
 the
 US
 was


taking
 advantage
 in
 in
 some
 way.
 And
 in


fact,
 you
 could
 argue
 that
 that
 sense
 of


unfairness
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 got
 us
 to


where
 we
 are
 today.
 So,
 was
 it
 really


rules-based
 for
 everyone?


>> So,
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to
 look
 back
 at
 the


the
 whole
 history
 of
 the
 post-war


period.
 Uh
 because
 for
 decades,
 China


wasn't
 a
 factor.
 It
 wasn't
 part
 of
 the


global
 trading
 system.
 It
 wasn't
 a
 major


economy
 and
 it
 was
 the
 US
 and
 Europe,


Japan,
 others
 who
 came
 together
 to


really
 form
 this
 set
 of
 rules
 and
 it's


never
 a
 perfect
 system.
 You
 my
 my
 sense


is
 you
 what
 what
 rules
 means
 is
 that


most
 countries
 follow
 most
 of
 the
 rules


most
 of
 the
 time.


>> Not
 that
 it's
 100%
 perfection.
 By
 the


way,
 that's
 true
 when
 you
 have
 laws
 in


the
 United
 States.
 I
 mean,
 we
 have
 laws


in
 the
 United
 States
 because
 people
 do


commit
 crimes.
 The
 existence
 of
 laws


does
 not
 prevent
 people
 from
 committing


crimes.
 That's
 why
 you
 need
 enforcement.


Same
 thing
 is
 true
 on
 the
 international


side.
 Uh
 as
 well
 the
 big
 difference
 as


you
 pointed
 out
 Tracy
 is
 when
 China


became
 a
 major
 factor
 in
 the
 global


economy
 and
 began
 to
 integrate
 globally.


Um
 on
 one
 hand
 there
 was
 an
 opportunity


to
 say
 okay
 this
 is
 an
 opportunity
 for


bring
 China
 into
 the
 global
 system.
 Get


them
 to
 adopt
 these
 set
 of
 rules
 that


the
 rest
 of
 us
 have
 all
 agreed
 to


because
 they
 appear
 to
 be
 on
 this
 path


towards
 market
 reform,
 openness,


liberalization.
 Right?
 I
 think
 what


happened
 in
 reality
 is
 that
 that


trajectory
 wasn't
 as
 linear,
 didn't
 go


as
 far,
 didn't
 go
 as
 fast
 as
 people


anticipated.
 And
 what
 we
 did
 not


anticipate
 is
 that
 somebody
 like


President
 Xi
 would
 come
 in
 and
 in
 fact


stop
 or
 reverse
 it.
 And
 so
 now
 we
 have


an
 economy
 that
 is
 huge,
 second
 largest


economy
 in
 the
 world,
 biggest


manufacturing
 part
 of
 the
 uh the
 global


economy,
 likely
 to
 be
 accounting
 for


something
 like
 45%
 of
 all
 global


manufacturing
 in
 a
 few
 years,
 which
 is


the
 biggest
 that
 any
 country
 has
 ever


been
 in
 history.
 And
 it's
 following
 a


fundamentally
 different
 set
 of
 rules.


And
 that
 has
 led
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 stress


in
 the
 international
 system.


[Music]


Can
 you
 explain
 maybe
 the
 philosophical


premise
 behind
 the
 idea
 that


trade
 with
 China


I
 guess
 why
 do
 we
 care
 about
 what
 their


internal
 rules
 are
 right
 theory
 of
 trade


it's
 sort
 Okay,
 they're
 cheaper
 for


whatever
 reason
 or
 they're
 more


efficient,
 etc.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,


comparative
 advantage,
 we
 benefit
 from


that.
 Why
 does
 the
 global
 trading


system,
 why
 is
 it
 or
 was
 it
 or
 is
 it


premised
 on
 this
 notion
 that
 all
 of
 the


participants
 would
 trend
 in
 some
 sort
 of


more
 liberal
 direction
 with
 their


domestic
 economies?
 You
 know,
 I
 think


it's
 because
 the
 actions
 that
 China
 has


taken
 domestically
 to
 drive
 their
 really


quite
 remarkable
 economic
 growth
 over


the
 last
 few
 decades
 uh
 does
 have


ramifications
 outside
 of
 China
 has


ramifications
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world


for
 manufacturing
 in
 the
 rest
 of
 the


world
 for
 for
 other
 factors.
 And
 so
 it's


it's
 not
 something
 that
 can
 be
 limited


to
 China.
 If
 if
 China
 gets
 to
 where
 it's


going
 because
 it
 steals
 intellectual


property
 uh
 because
 it
 produces


overcapacity
 so
 it
 produc
 creates
 far


more
 factories
 than
 it
 needs
 to
 for
 the


reasonable
 demand
 for
 a
 product
 in
 order


to
 drive
 other
 producers
 out
 of
 the


market
 in
 other
 countries
 that
 has
 an


adverse
 effect
 on
 us.
 If
 they
 subsidize


stateowned
 enterprises
 um
 or
 even


private
 enterprises
 in
 such
 a
 way
 that


it
 creates
 this
 unlevel
 playing
 field


then
 it
 affects
 the
 rest
 of
 us
 as
 well.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 what's
 really


happened
 is
 that
 uh
 China
 whether
 it's
 a


stateowned
 enterprises
 subsidization


intellectual
 property
 rights
 theft


government
 intervention
 into
 the
 private


sector
 all
 towards
 positioning
 China
 as


the
 leading
 manufacturer
 but
 it
 has
 come


at
 the
 expense
 of
 other
 industrialized


countries
 in
 some
 cases
 other
 emerging


economies
 and
 that's
 why
 there's
 been


this
 counter
 reaction.
 M
 so
 I
 know
 you


were
 a
 trade
 representative
 before
 the


tensions
 with
 China
 really
 ramped
 up
 um


under
 the
 first
 Trump
 administration
 but


how
 were
 you
 thinking
 back
 then
 about


incentivizing
 other
 countries
 when
 it


comes
 to
 trade
 negotiations
 like
 carrot


and
 stick
 strategy
 was
 it
 mostly
 about


incentives
 and
 if
 so
 what
 were
 you


giving
 them
 or
 was
 it
 sometimes
 maybe


threats


>> so
 you
 have
 to
 use
 both
 I
 think
 on
 the


threat
 side
 it's
 not
 really
 threats
 it


was
 enforcement


that
 we
 would
 bring
 cases
 against


countries
 including
 China


>> at
 the
 WTO
 or
 against
 other
 trading


partners
 where
 we
 had
 arrangements
 uh
 if


they
 we
 felt
 that
 they
 were
 violating


our
 rights
 under
 those
 agreements.
 Uh
 we


brought
 during
 the
 Obama
 administration


I
 think
 we
 brought
 the
 most
 cases
 ever


brought
 against
 China.
 We
 won
 all
 the


cases
 that
 got
 to
 conclusion.
 The


problem
 was
 China
 would
 find
 ways
 either


of
 delaying
 implementation
 or
 by
 the


time
 the
 fix
 was
 implemented
 the


relevant
 industry
 in
 the
 United
 States


or
 elsewhere
 was
 gone.
 And
 so
 it
 was


really
 sort
 of
 cold
 comfort
 and
 that's


one
 of the
 challenges
 I
 think
 that
 we


saw
 in
 the
 in
 the
 World
 Trade


Organization.
 I
 think
 on
 the
 incentive


side
 that's
 where
 trade
 agreements,
 real


trade
 agreements
 come
 into
 play.


>> Uh
 I
 was
 involved
 in
 something
 called


the
 Trans-Pacific
 Partnership
 which
 was


12
 countries
 around
 the
 Asia-Pacific


region
 that
 were
 working
 on
 opening


their
 economies
 to
 each
 other
 abiding
 by


a
 high
 standard
 set
 of
 of
 rules.


>> Some
 of
 the
 countries
 already
 had
 free


trade
 agreements
 with
 us.
 about
 half
 of


them
 did.
 So
 we
 weren't
 giving
 them
 any


more
 access
 to
 our
 economy.
 We'd
 already


given
 them
 access,
 but
 at
 the
 table
 we


had
 Japan.
 And
 Japan
 was
 a
 economy
 that


had
 never
 really
 opened
 up
 to
 other


markets.
 And
 these
 other
 countries
 knew


that
 they
 couldn't
 get
 Japan
 to
 open
 on


their
 own.
 But
 if
 the
 US
 was
 pushing


Japan
 to
 open,
 they
 would
 benefit
 from


it.
 M


>> so
 you
 had
 countries
 like
 Peru
 or
 Chile


who
 had
 already
 had
 free
 trade


agreements
 with
 us
 willing
 to
 raise


their
 labor
 standards
 or
 willing
 to


enforce
 environmental
 laws
 because
 they


were
 getting
 access
 not
 to
 our
 market


but
 to
 Japan
 and
 that
 incentive
 was
 one


that
 was
 powerful
 for
 them.


>> That's
 a
 very
 uh
 that's
 a
 very


interesting
 dynamic.
 talk
 a
 little
 bit


more
 about
 those
 years
 2013
 pre-Trump


and
 the
 actions
 toward
 China
 because
 if


you
 said
 by
 that
 point
 Obama
 had
 already


introduced
 a
 record
 number
 of
 actions


against
 China
 winning
 many
 of
 them
 or


winning
 all
 of
 them
 did
 you
 say


>> all
 of
 them
 that
 went
 to
 conclusions


>> all
 of
 them
 that
 went
 to
 conclusion
 but


it
 didn't
 really
 matter
 because
 either


there
 was
 some
 way
 to
 evade
 or
 the
 US


industry
 had
 been
 decimated
 was
 there


something
 pre-Trump
 I
 mean
 I
 don't
 know


whenever
 that
 was
 was
 there
 a
 feeling


that
 something
 has
 to
 change


fundamentally
 in
 how
 the
 US
 and
 China


trade
 or
 the
 rules
 governing
 that
 trade


even
 at
 that
 point.


>> No,
 absolutely.
 Look,
 the
 the
 day
 one
 of


the
 Obama
 administration,
 uh
 the
 the


world
 had
 been
 involved
 in
 something


called
 the
 Doha
 round
 of
 negotiations
 at


the
 World
 Trade
 Organization.
 It
 had


been
 going
 on
 since
 2001.


>> And
 I
 remember
 going
 to
 a
 G20
 summit.


There
 was
 one
 in
 April
 in
 London.
 and


all
 the
 other
 leaders
 around
 the
 table.


Here
 was
 the
 new
 president
 of
 the
 United


States
 on
 their
 mind
 was
 asking
 him,


okay,
 what
 are
 you
 going
 to
 do
 to
 bring


the
 Doha
 round
 to
 successful
 conclusion


this
 year?
 And
 the
 president
 said,
 "All


right,
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 back
 and
 take
 a


look
 at
 this."
 And
 he
 asked
 a
 group
 of


us
 to
 do
 a
 study.
 And
 by
 the
 summer,
 uh,


we
 had
 come
 back
 to
 him
 and
 said,
 "This


Doha
 round
 isn't
 going
 to
 get
 done."
 Uh


but
 the
 DA
 round
 was
 founded
 on
 this


fundamental
 premise
 in
 2001
 that


basically
 developing
 countries
 should
 it


was
 called
 the
 development
 round
 and
 the


primary
 beneficiaries
 of
 the
 DA
 round


would
 have
 been
 developing
 countries
 not


industrialized
 countries
 and
 the


fundamental
 premise
 was
 developing


countries
 shouldn't
 have
 to
 live
 by
 too


many
 rules.


industrial
 countries
 should
 and
 this


would
 help
 the
 developing
 countries


catch
 up.


>> By
 2009,
 when
 we
 saw
 what
 had
 happened


with
 China
 between
 2001
 and
 2009,
 there


was
 no
 way
 that
 an
 agreement
 that
 gave


China
 a
 pass
 on
 rules
 so
 that
 it
 could


continue
 to
 expand
 its
 manufacturing
 and


undermine
 manufacturing
 around
 the
 world


that
 that
 was
 going
 to
 fly.
 And
 the


president
 went
 back
 to
 the
 other
 leaders


at
 the
 next
 G20
 meeting
 and
 said
 the


Doha
 round
 is
 not
 going
 to
 get
 done
 on


the
 path
 that
 is
 currently
 on.
 And
 I


remember
 we
 were
 at
 a
 G20
 summit
 and
 the


other
 leaders
 all
 went
 around
 and
 read


their
 talking
 points.
 The
 traditional


talking
 point
 at
 the
 time
 was
 a
 Doha


round
 will
 get
 completed
 by
 December


this
 year
 or
 by
 the
 ministerial
 this


year.
 And
 you
 know,
 President
 Obama


intervened.
 He
 made
 his
 point.
 the
 other


leaders
 read
 their
 talking
 points
 and
 he


put
 his
 flag
 back
 up


>> and
 said,
 you
 know,
 you
 guys
 aren't


listening.
 This
 isn't
 going
 to
 happen.


And
 that
 was
 the
 first
 indication
 that


something
 needed
 to
 change.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 we
 were
 sitting
 down
 with


the
 Chinese
 bilaterally
 in
 lots
 of


consultations
 um
 sort
 of
 unending


consultations
 and
 we'd
 have
 this


conversation
 with
 them
 and
 remind
 them


that
 their
 tremendous
 success
 was
 based


on
 a
 benign
 international
 environment


the
 capacity
 to
 export
 to
 the
 rest
 of


the
 world
 and
 that
 if
 we
 didn't
 address


these
 underlying
 concerns
 stateown


enterprises
 subsidization
 IPR
 rights
 etc


that
 benign
 international
 environment


was
 going
 to
 disappear
 and
 that
 of


course
 is
 exactly
 what's
 happened
 and


that's
 the
 bipartisan
 consensus
 against


China
 that
 has
 now
 emerged.
 We
 started


warning
 them
 of
 that
 back
 in
 2009
 2010


and
 I
 think
 we
 made
 some
 modest
 progress


during
 the
 Obama
 administration
 to
 get


them
 change
 certain
 certain
 practices


but
 by
 the
 time
 President
 Xi
 came
 in
 and


made
 it
 clear
 he
 was
 going
 to
 be


dominant
 in
 the
 following
 sectors
 he
 was


going
 to
 reduce
 his
 dependency
 on
 the


rest
 of
 the
 world
 and
 increase
 everybody


else's
 dependency
 on
 China
 the
 the
 game


was
 over.
 Actually,
 this
 leads
 into
 my


next
 question,
 which
 is
 we've
 talked
 a


lot
 about
 how,
 you
 know,
 there
 was
 this


break
 in
 the
 rules-based
 liberal
 trading


order.
 Was
 there
 a
 single
 moment
 where


you
 went
 like,
 "Aha,
 this
 has


fundamentally
 broken
 instead
 of
 just


like
 slowly
 declining,
 slowly
 changing.


Was
 there
 something
 that
 sticks
 out
 to


you
 about,
 wow,
 this
 is
 actually


changing
 right
 now?"


>> So,
 I
 I
 think
 that
 Doha
 moment
 back
 in


2009
 was
 one
 of
 them.
 Um
 uh
 I
 also
 think


later
 on
 in
 in
 the
 Obama
 administration,


we
 were
 trying
 to
 negotiate
 an
 agreement


over
 environmental
 goods.
 There
 was
 a


list
 of
 250
 or
 so
 products
 that
 would


have
 been,
 you
 know,
 good
 for
 countries


to
 buy
 more
 of
 and
 produce
 more
 of


because
 it
 was
 good
 for
 the
 environment,


for
 climate
 change
 or
 otherwise.
 And
 it


failed.
 It
 failed
 over
 bicycles.


that
 between
 China
 and
 the
 EU,
 the
 EU


was
 protecting
 the
 Polish
 bicycle


industry.


>> The
 China
 wanted
 to
 put
 bicycles
 on
 the


list
 and
 they
 couldn't
 agree
 on
 what
 to


do
 with
 bicycles.
 And
 so
 the
 entire


agreement
 fell
 over
 that
 one
 issue.
 And


to
 me,
 it
 sort
 of
 underscored,
 okay,


we're
 pretty
 far
 from
 reaching
 consensus


that
 if
 we
 can't
 reach
 agreement
 over


bicycles,


>> um,
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 reach
 agreement


over
 things
 that
 are
 much
 more


meaningful.


>> Were
 you
 surprised
 at
 all?
 I
 want
 to
 we


start
 to
 move
 a
 little
 bit
 closer
 to
 the


present.
 But
 before
 we
 go
 to
 the


present,
 was
 it
 inevitable
 that
 in
 your


view
 that
 the
 Biden
 administration
 ended


up
 as
 a
 continuation
 slashexpansion
 of


some
 of
 the
 Trump
 restrictions?
 Was


there
 still
 an
 opportunity
 to
 turn


somewhere
 closer
 to
 a
 pre-Trump
 path?
 I


I
 think
 there
 was
 an
 opportunity
 to
 make


some
 changes
 but
 not
 go
 back
 to
 the
 way


things
 were
 before.
 The
 the
 Biden


administration,
 for example,
 launched
 a


review
 of
 the
 China
 tariffs.


>> And
 I
 think
 in
 many
 respects,
 the
 B


administration
 was
 very
 strategic
 in
 how


it
 approached
 export
 controls
 and


foreign
 investment
 constraints.
 It
 was


very
 targeted.
 The
 tariffs,
 they


launched
 a
 review
 to
 try
 and
 distinguish


between
 strategic
 and
 non-strategic


tariffs.
 Like
 there's
 a
 case
 to
 be
 made


for
 tariffs
 if
 there's
 unfair
 trade


practices
 or
 if
 it's
 a
 product
 that
 you


really
 need
 to
 produce
 here
 in
 the


United
 States.
 You
 don't
 want


dependency,
 but
 do
 we
 need
 tariffs
 on


t-shirts
 and
 underwear
 and
 socks?
 Is


that
 important
 to
 our
 national
 security?


Um,
 and
 they
 never
 got
 themselves
 to
 the


position
 of
 reducing
 those
 tariffs.
 And


to
 me,
 it's
 not
 a
 necessarily
 a


criticism
 of
 of
 the
 Biden


administration.
 I
 think
 it
 just
 goes
 to


show
 that
 tariffs
 are
 easy
 to
 put
 on
 and


hard
 to
 take
 off
 because
 once
 they're


on,
 there
 are
 constituencies


of
 that
 are
 supportive
 of
 them
 and
 any


movement
 to
 to
 reduce
 tariffs,


particularly
 in
 this
 political
 context,


is
 seen
 as
 being
 weak
 on
 China,
 even
 if


it
 makes
 pure
 sense
 from
 a
 economic


point
 of
 view.
 You
 know
 who
 who
 is
 hurt


most
 by
 tariffs
 on
 underwear,
 t-shirts,


and
 socks?
 It
 tends
 to
 be
 low-income


Americans
 who
 spend
 a
 disproportionate


amount
 of
 their
 disposable
 income
 on


imported
 goods.
 And
 you
 know,
 we
 could


afford
 to
 bring
 in
 those
 products
 from


China
 without
 questioning
 our
 national


security


>> without
 losing
 our
 strategic
 underwear


producing
 capacity.
 Although
 I
 think
 the


US
 military
 does
 actually
 have
 some


strategic


>> clothing.
 There
 are
 restrictions
 under


under
 uh
 uh
 I
 used
 to
 call
 it
 the


department
 of
 defense
 uh
 the
 department


of
 war
 that
 require
 uniforms,
 footwear


and
 other
 things
 to
 be
 made
 in
 the


United
 States.


>> Fun
 fact,
 how
 would
 you
 actually


describe
 the
 current
 state
 of
 the
 global


trade
 system?
 Because
 you
 know
 I'
 I've


heard
 people
 say
 there
 are
 shades
 of


mercantalism,
 protectionists,
 that
 sort


of
 thing.
 what
 what's
 your
 description


of
 where
 we
 are
 right
 now?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 the
 challenge
 of
 where
 we


are
 right
 now
 is
 you
 have
 the
 two


largest
 economies
 in
 the
 world
 uh
 the
 US


and
 China
 basically
 following
 their
 own


set
 of
 rules
 rather
 than
 the


multilateral
 rules-based
 system
 that
 the


US
 was
 very
 much
 driving
 the
 creation


and
 the
 defense
 of
 over
 all
 these
 um


over
 all
 these
 years.
 And
 when
 you
 have


the
 two
 largest
 economies
 doing
 that,


the
 question
 is
 well
 what's
 what
 are
 the


other
 economies
 going
 to
 do?
 Are
 they


going
 to
 start
 imitating
 the
 US
 or


China?
 Will
 they
 continue
 to
 abide
 by


the
 rules
 if
 nobody
 else
 does?
 Uh
 I


think
 they're
 all
 sort
 of
 wrestling
 with


that
 question
 because
 for
 for
 some
 of


them
 like
 the
 European
 Union,
 European


Union
 is
 more
 ideologically
 in
 favor
 of


free
 trade,
 integration,
 the
 rules
 based


system.
 The
 whole
 notion
 of
 the
 European


Union
 is
 based
 on
 that
 of
 bringing
 the


European
 countries
 together,
 let
 alone


the
 rest
 of
 the
 world.
 So,
 it's
 harder


for
 them
 to
 make
 this
 leap
 than
 it
 has


been
 for
 for
 the
 United
 States.
 But
 I


think
 the
 reality
 is
 is
 that
 the
 the


system
 is
 under
 is
 under
 great
 stress


and
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 think
 through


how
 does
 it
 evolve?
 What
 are
 the


elements
 of
 it
 that
 we
 want
 to
 try
 and


preserve
 or
 or
 reconstitute?
 Um,
 and
 how


does
 it
 need
 to
 change
 to
 take
 into


account
 not
 only
 the
 lessons
 of
 the
 last


80
 years
 prior
 to
 Trump,
 but
 the
 lessons


of
 the
 Trump
 administration,
 you
 know,


some
 of
 which
 will
 be
 instructive.


[Music]


Let's
 talk
 more
 about
 some
 of
 the
 paths


that
 things
 could
 go
 because
 I'm


thinking
 about
 setting
 aside
 even
 the


Europe
 Europe
 and
 the
 US
 uh
 you
 know


there
 was
 the
 bricks
 uh
 gathering


recently
 these
 are
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of


countries
 whose
 own
 developmental


trajectory
 could
 be
 undermined
 by


China's
 manufacturing
 success.
 Right?


And
 yet
 perhaps
 because
 of
 the
 actions


of
 this
 administration
 etc.
 they
 don't


feel
 that
 there
 is
 a
 sort
 of
 comfortable


home
 or
 friend
 in
 DC
 and
 that
 maybe
 it


makes
 more
 sense
 for
 them
 even
 given
 the


uh
 competitive
 challenges
 to
 be
 uh


friendlier
 with
 Beijing
 etc.
 What
 is


your
 view
 on
 that?
 Do
 you
 believe
 there


could
 be
 a
 new
 I
 mean
 one
 thing
 we've


heard
 we
 were
 talking
 to
 uh
 we
 recently


interviewed
 Robert
 Kaplan
 vice
 chairman


over
 at
 Goldman
 Sachs.
 His
 view
 was


globalization
 is
 alive
 and
 well.
 It's


just
 that
 the
 US
 isn't
 really
 part
 of
 it


and
 that
 we're
 actually
 reemerging
 uh


sort
 of
 free
 trade
 etc
 except
 it's
 with


China
 at
 the
 helm.
 Is
 that
 a
 fair


characterization?
 Like
 what
 is
 happening


with
 these
 massive
 other
 countries
 as


they
 think
 about
 who
 their
 partners
 and


friends
 are?
 So
 first
 of
 all,
 I
 I
 think


uh
 I
 think
 globalization
 is
 not
 over.


Other
 countries
 continue
 to
 move
 ahead


to
 integrate
 their
 economies.
 European


Union
 has
 signed
 additional
 trade


agreements
 with
 with
 Americaur.
 They're


working
 on
 one
 with
 with
 uh
 India.


Africa
 has
 a
 continentalwide
 free
 trade


agreement
 signed
 a
 few
 years
 ago
 that


they're
 in
 the
 process
 of
 of


implementing.
 So
 I
 think
 uh
 uh
 Robert


Kaplan's
 observation
 that
 it's
 the
 US


that
 has
 exempted
 itself
 is
 to
 a
 certain


degree
 correct.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 the
 next


step
 is
 that
 this
 is
 all
 going
 to
 shift


to
 China
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 Chinaled


block
 because
 there's
 no
 country
 that's


more
 concerned
 about
 the
 potential


adverse
 impact
 of
 Chinese
 exports
 on


their
 own
 manufacturing
 and
 economic


aspirations
 than
 than
 India.


>> India
 and
 you
 could
 add
 Brazil,
 you


could
 add
 Indonesia,
 you
 could
 add
 South


Africa.
 They're
 all
 deeply
 concerned


that
 if
 the
 US
 and
 Europe
 begin
 to
 close


their
 markets,
 all
 that
 excess
 capacity


from
 China
 has
 to
 go
 somewhere
 and
 it


could
 well
 get
 dumped
 in
 their
 markets


and
 hurt
 their
 capacity
 to
 build
 up


their
 manufacturing
 uh
 base
 as
 well.
 And


so
 I
 I've
 been
 of
 the
 view
 that
 you
 know


we
 we
 had
 this
 the
 the
 cold
 war
 was


about
 bipolarity,
 US
 Soviet
 Union.


the
 the
 wall
 came
 down,
 Soviet
 Union
 was


dismantled,
 and
 that
 was
 kind
 of a


unipolar
 moment.
 That's
 over
 now.
 That


30-year
 period
 is
 over.
 What
 we
 have
 now


isn't
 multipolarity.
 It's
 not
 like


you've
 got
 two
 or
 three
 camps
 that
 do


everything
 together.
 A
 China
 camp,
 a
 US


camp,
 some
 other
 camp.
 I
 think
 it's


really
 more
 akin
 to
 like
 polyamorous


life,
 right?
 Like
 in
 India
 is
 the


perfect


>> We
 got
 our
 episode
 title.


>> That's
 right.


India
 is
 the
 greatest
 is
 the
 greatest


example
 of
 this.
 India
 loves
 the
 United


States
 at least
 until
 recently
 for


technical
 technological
 cooperation
 for


uh
 civil
 nuclear
 cooperation
 for


investment
 for
 the
 relationship
 between


the
 Indian
 diaspora
 and
 our
 you
 know


entrepreneurial
 um
 uh
 ecosystem
 here.


They
 love
 Russia
 for
 oil
 for
 arms.
 They


love
 Iran
 for
 oil.
 They
 love
 and
 they


hate
 depending
 on
 the
 day.
 Um
 they've


had
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 countries
 they've


gone
 to
 war
 with,
 you
 know,
 on
 their


border.
 They've
 had
 skirmishes.
 People


have
 died
 in
 armed
 conflict
 between


India
 and
 China.
 But
 then
 as
 you
 saw


recently,
 there
 was
 a
 a
 conference
 in


China
 where
 you
 had
 uh
 Modi,
 she
 and


Putin
 holding
 hands
 uh
 walking
 down
 the


red
 carpet
 together.
 So
 I
 think
 India
 is


is
 archetypal
 example
 of
 trying
 to
 play


these
 relationships.
 They
 always
 were


during
 the
 Cold
 War
 too,
 right?
 They


were
 they
 were
 nonaligned
 country,


right?
 I
 mean,
 it's
 changed
 now.
 Then


they
 were
 non-aligned.
 Now,
 I
 think


they're
 multi-aligned.
 So,
 they'll
 be


aligned
 with
 the
 polyamorous.
 And
 but


you
 you
 could
 use
 the
 same
 analysis
 to
 I


think
 cover
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 countries,
 a


lot
 of the
 other
 middle
 countries.


>> That
 makes
 it
 a
 much
 more
 complicated


world.
 You
 know,
 in
 retrospect,
 the
 Cold


War
 was
 very
 simple.
 Was
 black
 and


white.
 You
 were
 with
 us.
 You're
 with
 the


Soviet
 Union,
 you
 know,
 and
 there
 were


some
 proxy
 wars
 in
 between,
 but
 it
 was


pretty
 it
 was
 pretty
 simple.
 This
 is


much
 more
 complicated
 and
 it
 it
 leads
 to


the
 the
 view
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 have


to
 be
 very
 proactive
 and
 creative
 in


creating
 coalitions
 of
 the
 willing


around
 various
 issues
 because
 sometimes


India
 might
 be
 in
 it,
 sometimes
 they


might
 not,
 sometimes
 China
 might
 be
 in


it,
 sometimes
 not.
 And
 and
 I
 think


that's
 the
 the
 challenge
 for
 for
 the


United
 States
 to
 continue
 to
 exert


leadership
 going
 forward.


>> How
 resilient
 would
 those
 smaller


coalitions
 of
 the
 willing
 actually
 be?


because
 I
 can
 imagine
 maybe
 it's
 easier


to
 negotiate
 with
 a
 smaller
 group.
 Maybe


you
 don't
 get
 caught
 up
 in
 debates
 over


bicycles
 and
 things
 like
 that.
 But
 on


the
 other
 hand,
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 like
 a


big
 trading
 partner
 who
 is
 necessarily


driving
 the
 agenda,
 it
 seems
 like
 it


might
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 difficult
 to


enforce.


I
 think
 you
 need
 a
 combination
 of


smaller
 groups
 of
 like-minded
 countries


but
 it
 does
 to
 your
 point
 Tracy
 require


leadership


>> and
 in
 the
 past
 the
 US
 has
 been
 a
 leader


of
 it.
 I
 mean
 you've
 got
 some
 very


strong
 examples
 like
 NATO


>> you
 know
 a
 military
 alliance
 is
 the


strongest
 example
 of
 a
 pluralateral


group
 so
 something
 less
 than
 the
 whole


world
 but
 of
 like-minded
 countries
 that


have
 agreed
 to
 do
 certain
 things


together
 because
 they
 have
 a
 common


interest
 to
 do
 so.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 it
 would


exist
 without
 US
 leadership
 and
 US


driving
 it
 going
 forward.
 That
 was
 true


of
 the
 Trans-Pacific
 Partnership
 uh
 as


well.
 I
 think
 it
 could
 be
 true
 of
 of
 a


number
 of
 these
 other
 things.
 And
 by
 the


way,
 China's
 very
 good
 at
 this.
 I
 mean,


the
 the
 conference,
 the
 Shanghai


Cooperation
 Organization
 Conference
 that


they
 recently
 held
 uh
 where
 where
 Modi


and
 others
 were
 present,
 that's
 a
 good


example
 of
 them
 pulling
 together


coalitions.
 Um
 uh
 bricks
 is
 another
 good


example.
 Now,
 we
 can
 talk
 about
 the


strengths
 and
 the
 weaknesses
 of
 bricks


and
 where
 the
 countries
 actually
 have


common
 interests
 and
 conflicting


interests,
 but
 it's
 that
 kind
 of
 drive


that
 you
 need
 a
 leader
 and
 you
 need
 a


group
 of
 like-minded
 countries.
 Let's


talk
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 about
 some
 of


these
 tensions
 that
 emerge
 because


it
 does
 sound
 like
 you
 know
 bricks


bricks
 is
 a
 nice
 acronym
 that
 Jim
 O'Neil


from
 Goldman
 Sachs
 asset
 management
 came


up
 with
 in
 2001
 and
 which
 may
 now
 be
 um


you
 know
 this
 important
 geo
 uh


geopolitical
 entity
 we'll
 see
 we
 don't


really
 know
 for
 sure
 yet
 but
 it
 seems


like
 one
 possibility
 is
 that
 okay
 the
 US


we
 feel
 that
 we
 need
 to
 have
 in
 key


strategic
 sectors
 there's
 some
 sort
 of


you
 know
 capacity
 to
 build


semiconductors
 or
 maybe
 capacity
 to


build
 batteries
 at
 least
 there
 was
 a
 big


push
 under
 that
 under
 the
 Biden


administration
 of
 course
 China
 has
 that


and
 it's
 growing
 I
 mean
 when
 people


think
 about
 the
 economy
 going
 forward
 is


there
 a
 risk
 that
 essentially
 every


country
 feels
 they
 have
 to
 make
 that


decision
 that
 India
 feels
 it
 has
 to
 have


its
 own
 battery
 making
 capacity
 that


Germany
 feels
 it
 has
 to
 make
 its
 own


battery
 making
 capacity
 and
 that
 there


is
 a
 sort
 of
 domino
 effect
 and
 we
 just


wind
 up
 in
 a
 much
 costlier,
 less


efficient
 world.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 we
 are
 heading
 towards
 a


costlier,
 less
 efficient
 world.
 I'm
 not


sure
 that's
 necessarily
 a
 bad
 outcome.


Okay.
 in
 that
 um
 to
 to
 go
 down
 the
 path


of
 greatest
 efficiency


>> could
 be
 to
 at least
 in
 the
 short
 run
 to


become
 utterly
 dependent
 on
 China
 for


all
 of
 this
 product
 because
 they
 can


produce
 things
 cheaper
 not
 not


>> not
 always
 because
 it's
 cheaper
 labor


but
 because
 they
 become
 very
 efficient


infrastructure
 massive
 scale


>> massive
 scale
 and
 I
 think
 the
 question


is
 is
 it
 is
 it
 a
 good
 thing
 I
 mean
 is
 it


that
 the
 US
 have
 a
 battery
 industry
 and


that
 Europe
 have
 a
 battery
 industry
 it's


probably
 a
 good
 thing
 it
 may
 not
 be
 as


efficient
 as
 relying
 completely
 on


China,
 but
 having
 that
 diversification


particularly
 over
 the
 long
 run
 is
 a


positive.
 Rule
 number
 one
 of
 of
 risk


management,
 diversification.
 And
 yet
 we


became
 very
 complacent
 and
 very
 uh
 we


became
 very
 complacent
 over
 the
 years
 of


just
 relying
 on
 China
 as
 our


manufacturing
 floor.
 And
 now
 I
 think


companies
 have
 come
 to
 the
 conclusion


whether
 it
 was
 because
 of
 natural


disasters,
 COVID
 or
 political


intervention
 as
 we've
 seen
 with
 with


China
 that
 it's
 it's
 to
 their
 benefit,


their
 economic
 benefit
 even
 over
 the


longer
 run
 to
 diversify
 even
 in
 the


short
 run
 if
 it's
 more
 expensive.
 M
 with


your
 trade
 representative
 hat
 on,
 can


you
 maybe
 say
 something
 about
 how
 you


view
 military
 strategy
 and
 I
 guess
 trade


and
 this
 idea
 of
 well
 maybe
 we
 want
 to


be
 independent,
 maybe
 we
 want
 to
 have


independent
 capacity
 in
 something
 that's


strategically
 important
 like


semiconductors
 or
 I
 don't
 know
 making


ballistic
 missiles
 or
 something
 like


that.
 How
 does
 the
 US
 government


actually
 think
 about
 the
 relationship


between
 trade
 and
 military
 might?
 So
 I


think
 over
 time
 uh
 broadly
 economics
 and


national
 security
 have
 converged
 into


economic
 security
 and
 we're
 sorting


through
 what
 that
 means
 in
 practice.
 So


in
 the
 case
 of
 the
 Biden
 administration


they
 talked
 about
 a
 small
 yard
 and
 a


high
 fence.
 So
 take
 a
 limited
 number
 of


technologies
 and
 say
 these
 technologies


we
 refuse
 to
 export
 to
 our
 our


competitors
 and
 our
 adversaries.
 uh
 we


refuse
 to
 uh
 allow
 them
 to
 buy
 US


companies
 that
 specialize
 in
 those


technologies
 and
 refuse
 our
 companies
 to


who
 dominate
 that
 area
 to
 invest
 in
 in


China
 and
 give
 them
 their
 capacity.
 But


it
 was
 a
 relatively
 few
 sectors


relatively
 few
 technologies.
 The


question
 is
 is
 is
 there
 a
 inexraable
 set


of
 pressures
 to
 expand
 that
 yard
 and
 to


add
 more
 and
 more
 things
 to
 it
 and
 where


is
 it
 appropriate
 and
 and
 where
 is
 it


not
 appropriate
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 what


we're
 now
 sort
 of
 of
 wrestling
 with.


We're
 highly
 dependent
 on
 China
 for
 all


the
 ingredients
 that
 go
 into
 our


pharmaceuticals.
 Do
 we
 feel
 comfortable


with
 that?
 China's
 done
 nothing
 to
 say


they
 would
 cut
 it
 off
 but
 they
 could.


And
 we've
 seen
 recently
 China
 has
 used


its
 choke
 point
 capacity,
 rare
 earths,


magnets
 to
 demonstrate
 that
 it
 has


leverage
 too.
 And
 it
 worked.
 The
 Trump


administration
 raised
 tariffs
 to
 145%
 on


China.
 China
 restricted
 the
 export
 of


certain
 rare
 earths
 and
 and
 magnets.
 And


suddenly
 there
 was
 a
 deescalation.


And
 so
 we
 have
 to
 now
 wrestle
 with
 that


and
 decide
 over
 the
 long
 run
 what


products
 do
 we
 actually
 need
 to
 be
 made


in
 the
 United
 States
 because
 they're
 so


critical
 to
 national
 security
 or
 our


sense
 of
 of of
 of
 national
 security
 and


which
 ones
 and
 this
 is
 where
 there's


been
 I
 think
 insufficient
 attention.


Which
 ones
 can
 we
 rely
 on
 our
 allies
 and


partners?


>> Because
 we
 probably
 can't
 produce


everything
 at
 least
 in
 the
 short
 run
 or


wouldn't
 make
 sense
 to
 produce


everything
 ourselves.
 But
 can
 we
 rely
 on


Canada
 and
 Europe
 and
 Japan
 and
 South


Korea
 and
 Mexico
 for
 some
 of
 this


production
 uh
 or
 in
 India?
 And
 how
 do
 we


differentiate
 between
 which
 products
 fit


in
 what
 group?
 And
 therefore
 then
 what


do
 we
 need
 to
 do
 about
 it
 to
 drive


production
 here
 where
 necessary
 and
 to


develop
 the
 relationships
 with
 the


allies
 and
 partners
 where
 possible.
 The


idea
 of
 friend
 shoring
 or
 whatever
 you


want
 to
 call
 it
 sounds
 very
 intuitive


and
 it's
 we
 don't
 need
 to
 build
 a
 ton
 of


shipyards.
 Maybe
 we
 could
 get
 the


Koreans
 uh
 to
 do
 that
 for
 us
 or
 I
 don't


know
 the
 probably
 the
 Fins
 are
 good
 at


it.
 I'm
 not
 sure.
 Uh
 etc.
 The
 Fins
 are


very
 good.


>> Oh,
 the
 Fins
 are
 the
 icebreaker.
 Yeah,


that's
 right.
 One
 of
 these
 facts
 that


we've
 learned
 over
 the
 years.
 But
 is


there
 I
 mean
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


current
 administration,
 do
 you
 see


anything
 other
 than
 widening
 a
 gulf


between
 those
 partners?
 Like
 yeah,
 it


sounds
 great
 to
 have
 a
 nice
 relationship


with
 the
 Koreans
 for
 them
 to
 build
 more


ships
 for
 us
 and
 then
 that
 solves
 the


problem
 of
 scale
 and
 redundancy,
 etc.


But
 in
 practice,
 from
 your
 perspective,


is
 it
 going
 the
 opposite
 direction?


Well,
 look,
 I
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


challenges
 of
 of
 any
 administration,
 but


it's
 certainly
 evident
 in
 this
 one,
 is


the
 connecting
 of
 dots
 between
 one


policy
 objective
 and
 another
 policy


objective.


>> And
 so,
 uh,
 yes,
 in
 the
 short
 run,
 it


it's
 going
 to
 take
 us
 a
 while
 to
 build


up
 our
 ship
 building
 industry,
 and
 it's


going
 to
 require
 a
 lot
 of
 government


support,
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 require
 a
 lot


of
 policies
 that
 we've
 not
 yet
 adopted.


Uh,
 perhaps
 it's
 something
 we
 should
 do,


but
 it
 will
 take
 years.
 Yeah.
 To
 really


build
 that
 up.
 In
 the
 meantime,
 should


we
 look
 to
 Korea?
 Should
 we
 look
 to


Japan?
 Uh
 should
 we
 look
 to
 Finland
 for


the
 ships
 that
 we
 need
 right
 now?
 That's


one
 set
 of
 objectives.
 Then
 you
 have
 the


the
 raid
 on
 the
 Hyundai
 plant,
 which
 was


another
 set
 of
 objectives,
 you
 know,


objectives
 around
 migration,
 illegal


migration
 and
 and
 and
 illegal
 workers.
 I


I
 I
 sometimes
 wonder
 whether
 the
 dots


are
 being
 connected
 within
 the


administration
 or
 whether
 there's
 a
 view


and
 they
 may
 be
 right,
 they
 may
 be
 wrong


that
 they
 can
 have
 it
 both
 ways
 that


they
 can
 come
 down
 on
 Korean
 workers
 in


the
 United
 States
 and
 still
 look
 to


Korea
 and
 say
 you
 will
 deliver
 us
 ships


>> and
 share
 your
 expertise
 and
 technical


knowledge
 and
 all
 that


>> and
 help
 us
 build
 ship
 uh
 building
 here


in
 the
 United
 States.


>> I
 want
 to
 broaden
 out
 the
 conversation.


>> Michael's
 being
 very
 ambassadorial
 by


the
 way.
 Anyway,
 keep
 going.


>> Of
 course.
 Um,
 just
 to
 broaden
 out
 the


conversation
 though,
 back
 in
 March,
 I


wrote
 an
 Odd
 Thoughts
 newsletter
 titled,


"The
 US
 is
 looking
 a
 lot
 like
 China."


>> I
 got
 an
 enormous
 amount
 of
 push
 back
 on


it,
 but
 you
 actually
 wrote
 something


similar.
 And
 I
 don't
 even
 have
 a


question.
 Just
 tell
 me
 that
 I
 was
 right.


>> Uh,
 you're
 right.
 Um,
 you
 were
 right.


Thank
 you.
 Look,
 I
 think
 we
 spent
 years,


we
 we
 always
 thought
 there
 was
 a
 theory


of
 convergence
 that
 by
 bringing
 China


into
 the
 international
 system,


>> we
 would
 become
 more
 alike.
 Now,
 our


view
 was
 they
 would
 become
 more
 like
 us.


>> Like
 us.
 Yeah.


>> More
 open,
 more
 liberal,
 more


marketoriented.
 And
 we
 used
 to
 go
 to


them
 and
 lecture
 them
 about
 don't
 be


protectionist.
 Uh
 don't
 restrict
 foreign


investment
 in
 your
 country.
 Don't
 don't


make
 it
 impossible
 for
 our
 companies
 to


invest
 in
 your
 company.
 Don't
 engage
 in


industrial
 policy
 and
 subsidization.
 and


don't
 take
 stakes
 in
 private
 companies


and
 and
 intervene
 in
 in
 the
 private


sector.
 And
 now
 what
 are
 we
 doing?
 We


are
 protectionist.
 Uh
 we
 have


restrictions
 on
 foreign
 investment.
 Uh


we
 are
 engaged
 in
 in
 limited
 industrial


policy.
 And
 now
 we're
 beginning
 to
 take


stakes,
 government
 stakes
 in
 private


companies.
 So
 rather
 than
 them
 becoming


more
 like
 us,
 we
 have
 become
 more
 like


them.
 And
 the
 challenge
 of
 that,
 I


think,
 is
 that
 we're
 now
 competing
 with


them
 on
 their
 playing
 field
 under
 their


set
 of
 rules.


>> I'm
 not
 at
 all
 convinced
 that
 we
 can


compete
 on
 their
 playing
 field
 as
 well


as
 we
 can
 compete
 on
 ours.
 Uh
 because
 we


don't
 have
 unlimited
 we
 can't
 go
 to


Congress
 and
 say
 give
 us
 unlimited


resources
 to
 invest
 in
 this
 sector
 after


after
 that
 sector.
 Uh
 we
 can't


subsidize,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 the


commanding
 heights
 of
 uh
 of
 the


technology
 uh
 competition.
 And
 I
 think


it's
 it's
 unfortunate
 because
 I
 think


the
 Chinese
 can
 play
 that
 game
 much


better
 than
 we
 can.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 really
 important


point
 because
 when
 we're
 thinking
 about,


you
 know,
 choke
 points
 in
 terms
 of


manufacturing
 or
 whatever,
 China
 has
 the


most
 experience
 out
 of
 practically


anyone
 in
 the
 world
 of
 like
 building
 up


strategic
 capacity
 and
 doing
 it
 in
 a


very
 conscious
 and
 interventionist
 way.


Well,
 and
 also
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 sort
 of
 um


massive
 uh
 over
 supply
 that
 people
 call


it
 is
 maybe
 to
 some
 extent
 intentional


but
 maybe
 also
 just
 to
 some
 extent
 a
 a


function
 of
 their
 provincial
 versus


provincial
 relationship
 where
 the


provinces
 are
 hyperco
 competing
 etc
 for


market
 share.


>> That's
 just
 a
 dynamic
 that
 that
 does


nothing
 like
 that
 exists
 in
 the
 United


States.
 And
 so
 the
 idea
 of
 moving
 in


that
 direction
 all
 kinds
 of
 conditions


either
 by
 design
 or
 just
 sort
 of
 by


happen
 stance
 of
 the
 political
 structure


of
 the
 system.
 It's
 just
 very
 different.


>> No,
 exactly
 right
 Joe.
 I
 think
 you
 know


in
 in
 their
 case


leadership
 says
 we
 want
 to
 be
 dominant


in
 these
 15
 sectors.
 Every
 provincial


governor
 looks
 at
 that
 and
 says,
 "All


right,
 I'm
 going
 to
 take
 my
 local
 state


judged
 by
 judged
 ability
 to
 produce


this."
 And
 we
 have,
 you
 know,
 in
 China,


I
 think
 there
 are
 over
 a
 hundred
 EV


companies,


>> right?


>> You
 know,
 and
 so
 and
 they're
 producing


and
 they
 will
 be
 producing
 enough
 cars


>> for
 to
 meet
 the
 demand
 of
 the
 entire


world.
 So
 where
 does
 that
 leave
 the
 US


auto
 sector?
 Where
 does
 it
 leave
 the
 the


European
 uh
 auto
 sector?
 Now,
 in
 our


case,
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 we've


effectively
 kept
 them
 out.
 We've


effectively
 said
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 have


Chinese
 EVs
 here,
 at least
 at
 the


moment.


>> Europeans
 have
 a
 slight,
 you
 know,
 more


schizophrenic
 about
 it.
 They've
 also


adopted
 protectionism,
 but
 they're
 more


open,
 I
 think,
 to
 having
 uh
 Chinese


imports.


>> What
 does
 that
 mean
 for
 the
 future
 of


Volkswagen,
 for
 the
 future
 of
 Renault,


for
 the
 future
 of
 the
 other
 auto


companies?
 And
 you
 know,
 in
 that
 case,


it
 could
 have
 broad
 political


implications
 in
 Europe
 uh
 as
 well
 over


time.
 I
 hesitate
 to
 ask
 this
 question,


but
 is
 there
 anything
 the
 US
 can
 learn


from
 China
 in
 terms
 of,
 you
 know,
 trade


and
 building
 out
 strategic
 industries?


>> Well,
 look,
 I
 I
 think
 China,
 we
 we


shouldn't
 make
 China
 to
 into
 more
 than


it
 is.
 China's
 made
 huge
 mistakes.


They've
 wasted
 hundreds
 of
 billions
 of


dollars
 um
 on
 bad
 domestic
 investments


and
 they've
 got,
 you
 know,
 tremendous


challenges,
 including
 demographic


challenges
 that
 the
 US
 uh
 uh
 currently


does
 doesn't
 have.
 Uh
 and
 so
 we


shouldn't
 make
 them
 out
 to
 be,
 you
 know,


12
 feet
 tall.
 I
 think
 one
 thing
 that
 is


current
 is
 to
 think
 through,
 okay,
 if


there
 is
 an
 industry
 that
 you
 think
 is


important
 for
 national
 security
 or


otherwise,
 what's
 the
 best
 way
 of


supporting
 it
 by
 the
 government?
 Um
 the


Trump
 administration's
 approach
 I
 think


has
 been
 based
 largely
 on
 tariffs,


>> right?


>> That
 if
 we
 create
 this
 wall
 of
 tariffs,


companies
 will
 have
 to
 produce
 or
 have


to
 move
 their
 supply
 chain
 to
 the
 United


States.
 Uh
 and
 that's
 how
 we'll
 build


out
 this
 area.
 I
 think
 what
 we've
 seen


in
 China
 is
 that
 yes,
 they've
 used


tariffs
 and
 other
 restrictions.
 They've


also
 used
 industrial
 policy.
 They've


also
 invested,


>> subsidies,
 credit,
 free
 energy.
 you


know,
 they've
 also
 invested
 heavily
 in


R&D
 um
 in
 in
 many
 sectors,
 the
 life


sciences,
 uh
 obviously
 AI
 among
 others,


government
 subsidies
 and
 government


investment.
 And
 it's
 that
 combination
 of


policies
 that
 probably
 is
 more
 effective


than
 tariffs
 alone.


>> To
 me,
 the
 concern
 is
 we
 we're


approaching
 this
 from
 a
 position
 of
 that


tariffs
 are
 the
 answer
 to
 everything.
 We


know
 what
 the
 cost
 of
 tariffs
 are
 and


we're
 taking
 a
 gamble
 on
 whether
 the


benefits
 will
 be
 there
 uh
 and
 whether


tariffs
 alone
 are
 going
 to
 remanufacture


the
 United
 States
 economy.


>> You
 mentioned
 that
 some
 degree
 of


greater
 redundancy
 and
 higher
 costs
 is


not
 the
 end
 of
 the
 world
 particularly
 if


uh
 there's
 some
 political
 it
 creates


some
 political
 sustainability.
 What
 is


what
 does
 the
 um
 the
 left
 tail
 risk


looks
 look
 like
 to
 you?
 What
 is
 the


scenario
 in
 which
 things
 really
 the


wheels
 really
 come
 off?


>> One,
 the
 US
 doesn't
 have
 a
 great
 history


with
 industrial
 policy.
 So,
 if
 we
 were


to
 multiply
 our
 efforts
 in
 in
 various


ways
 but
 not
 do
 it
 well,
 that
 would
 uh


that
 would
 be
 a
 waste
 of
 resources
 and


costs
 that
 we
 didn't
 need
 to
 need
 to


incur.
 I
 think
 if
 we
 don't
 to
 go
 back
 to


the
 point
 about
 allies
 and
 partners,
 if


we
 insist
 on
 reshoring
 everything
 and


not
 French
 shoring
 anything,
 I
 think
 we


probably
 lose
 some
 of
 the
 uh
 economies


of
 scale
 um
 and
 some
 of
 the
 comparative


advantage
 that
 we
 have.
 I
 also
 think
 if


we're
 if
 the
 if
 the
 existential
 threat


is
 competition
 with
 China,
 if
 they
 are


the
 pacing
 challenge,
 com
 working
 with


allies
 and
 partners
 is
 our
 way
 to
 reach


scale.
 Mhm.


>> We're
 a
 big
 economy.
 We're
 the
 biggest


economy
 in
 the
 world.
 But
 when
 it
 comes


to
 manufacturing,
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 be


able
 to
 compete
 with
 China
 alone


necessarily,
 or
 rather,
 we're
 going
 to


be able
 to
 compete
 with
 China
 much


better
 if
 we
 do
 so
 with
 our
 allies
 and


partners.


>> I
 have
 just
 one
 more
 question.
 This
 is


the
 most
 important
 one.
 How
 good
 are
 you


at
 Tradle?


>> Do
 you
 ever
 play
 that?


>> We
 do.
 I
 I
 we
 I
 love
 these
 games.
 Tradal


and
 World.


>> Oh,
 World.
 Yeah,
 that's
 the
 other
 one.
 I


didn't
 get
 into
 that.


>> Yeah.
 Portradal
 I
 think
 is
 is
 a
 great
 is


a
 great
 game.
 I
 don't
 always
 get
 it


right.
 U
 but
 I
 uh
 it's
 it's
 a
 good
 uh


it's
 a
 good
 reminder
 of
 just
 how
 complex


certain
 economies
 are.


>> After
 we're
 done
 with
 this,
 could
 you


help
 us
 find
 that
 dairy
 farmer
 who


explained
 the

[Music]


Tracy,
 I'm
 really
 um
 I'm
 really
 a
 fan
 of


this
 neologism
 or
 wherever
 it
 came
 from


the
 the
 polyamorous
 world
 order
 because


you
 know
 people
 talk
 about
 the
 uh
 the
 G7


and
 what's
 his
 name
 talks
 about
 the


G0ero
 and
 then
 other
 people
 talk
 oh


bipolarity
 but
 uh
 but
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a


good
 one.
 It
 is
 kind
 of
 funny
 to
 me
 that


there's
 this
 idea
 out
 there
 that
 just


because
 Goldman
 came
 up
 with
 like
 a


catchy
 acronym
 for
 the
 bricks
 that


somehow
 that's
 going
 to
 like
 create
 a


new
 strategic
 coalition
 from


>> countries.
 We
 should
 have
 Jim
 O'Neal
 on


to
 talk
 about
 we've
 never
 talked
 to
 Jim


O'Neal
 and
 so
 the
 thought
 of
 him
 coming


up
 with
 this
 paper
 these
 are
 going to
 be


the
 big
 economies
 and
 now
 they
 now
 it's


a
 rival
 block
 for
 the
 West
 is
 like
 a


really
 good


>> Oh,
 that
 would
 be
 really
 interesting.


But
 I
 do
 think
 okay
 one
 thing
 you
 can


say
 about
 polyamorous
 relationships
 is


they
 tend
 to
 come
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 drama


right
 and
 so
 it


>> it
 definitely
 feels
 like
 um
 we're
 going


to
 have
 more
 instability
 or
 at least


like
 more
 things
 changing
 more
 things
 in


flux
 more
 volatility


>> right
 so
 this
 idea
 that
 I
 I
 I
 find
 it


compelling
 this
 idea
 that
 the
 old


globalization
 can't
 just
 be
 replaced


with
 the
 same
 globalization
 except
 the


leader
 has
 changed,
 right?
 I
 mean,
 the


US
 was
 this
 huge
 trade
 deficit
 country.


>> China
 is
 a
 huge
 trade
 surplus
 country.


That
 naturally
 means
 that
 its


relationship
 with
 all
 of
 its
 partners
 on


some
 level,
 even
 if
 it
 wants
 to
 be
 at


the
 forefront
 of
 creating
 new


tariff-free
 zones,
 etc.,
 is
 going
 to
 be


of
 a
 different
 type
 than
 the


relationship
 that
 the
 US
 had.


>> Absolutely.
 Shall
 we
 leave
 it
 there?


>> Let's
 leave
 it
 there.


>> All
 right.
