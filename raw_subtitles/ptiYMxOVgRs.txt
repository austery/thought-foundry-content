Hi, my name is Tim.
I'm addicted to appreciation.
I know that sounds really strange.
But if I do my job
over the next eight minutes or so,
you're not going to look at anything
the same way ever again.
And because of a manhole cover
that I saw back on a terrible day in 2018.
It was quite literally one
of the top three
worst days of my entire career.
One of those comically miserable days
in corporate America.
I was managing a team of 270 people.
Everybody seemed to have a meltdown
on the same exact day,
at the same exact time.
Eight hours of unnecessarily
contentious meetings,
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about,
and there were pending layoffs
coming that spring.
I was one of the few people in the company
that knew that they were coming, too.
So the dread in the overwhelm
was just hanging over me.
I get off the subway,
late again for dinner,
and of course, I check
my phone immediately,
and there's an email
from my boss that says,
“Be in the office at 9am tomorrow morning,
and be prepared for that meeting to suck."
Like, great.
(Laughter)
As I'm walking home,
I go, "Ooh, a manhole cover.
You know, it's pretty cool that somebody
figured out that they would be safer
if they were circles instead of squares.
And I'm pretty sure
that they're made in India, too,
which is interesting,
considering we're in New York City.
I should look that up later."
I’m like, “Tim, what the F?
How in the world did you go
from all these overwhelming thoughts
on such a terrible day
to a manhole cover?"
Like this is a sincere
question in the moment.
Am I an idiot?
Like how is my brain going
from one place to another?
Is this the part of my brain
that was holding me back?
Very serious corporate job.
Is this the part of my brain
that is distracting me,
that is not allowing me
to grow further than where I was?
No.
This was the realization
that I was addicted to appreciation.
And that without it,
life was remarkably less enjoyable
because I was seeing
the mundane things in this way.
Appreciation is the act of noticing
and valuing the good in our worlds.
So by definition, and please
read this screen,
if there's one of the slides
you actually read word for word,
I want you to think
of what this would mean
if you thought this way
on a consistent basis too.
Being addicted to appreciation
means being addicted to the recognition
and enjoyment of the good qualities
of someone or something,
or simply wanting to have a better
understanding of the world around us.
Think about what that would mean
for your day-to-day.
And yes, this is being present,
this is the enjoyment
of some sort of activity
and the people around you.
But it's also the small things,
like a round manhole cover
in New York City.
As I started to digest this and think,
what does this actually
mean and how do I harness it,
I realized that before any cognitive
biases could pop into my head,
I was addicted to seeing the good
and giving benefit of the doubt
in a way that just unlocked
an entirely different level of life
for me, and enjoyment.
And the more that I leaned into this,
it gave me energy,
it gave me lust for life,
and it gave me just joy
on a day-to-day basis
in ways that I could never imagine
that have led me here today.
Even on a day as gloomy
as that day back in 2018.
By the way, I'm wearing
the same exact suit,
which is the craziest thing.
So of course I put it
on social media that night.
Forward Instagram-only story,
be addicted to appreciation,
really for friends and family
as my only followers back then.
But really, I was saying it for me.
That it's OK to see life this way.
It was almost this like freeing moment
of, I'm going to lean into this harder
and what is it going to do?
This is something that will not
only unlock how you see things,
but this is an act that you can practice
and will bring you joy in ways
that you will not be able to imagine
until you actually start to do it.
And I know what you're thinking, too.
Appreciation and gratitude,
like aren’t we talking
about the same thing here?
No, these are two very different things.
Appreciation is foundational.
Gratitude is transactional.
To show gratitude, you are actually
receiving something.
Appreciation is something
that can just layer into everything
that you are doing
and just your existence
on a day-to-day basis.
It can be annoying to see life
this way on such a consistent basis,
like raining for the third day in a row?
Maybe that's good for the reservoirs.
That arch nemesis at work
that is kind of like that person
that gives you a pit in your stomach?
That's somebody to understand better.
Show up where they need to be met,
and then you have the upper hand
in the relationship
simply because you appreciated them more.
Please trust me on this one.
This one works super, super well.
And this is not just my opinion.
It felt really good
when it was just my opinion,
but to see this corroborated
took it to a whole nother level.
There's a professor from Rutgers
that made appreciation
a core part of her studies.
And she concluded that appreciation
can be a disposition.
That it is not the same as gratitude.
That gratitude is actually just one
of eight components
that makes up what appreciation is.
And simply by noticing things
on a day-to-day basis,
you can have this mindset
of appreciation, too.
This is what led to me having an audience
of a million and a half people
on social media,
which is super weird to say
at 48 years old.
I was making these daily vlogs
of my corporate life
that were like, maniacal 4am to 10pm,
scheduled in 15-minute
time-blocking increments.
And people were like, wow, this is cool
and like super soothing to watch.
"This is a dope-ass Monday in your 40s"
is an opening hook on social media
I never in a million years
thought it would actually take off.
And it did.
And I started to see comments
along the lines of,
"You make growing up less scary."
And "Even though we are
from completely different worlds,
I love the way that you look at life."
I had no intention of having
that path lead me here today,
but that's what appreciation
has done for me.
So let me show you how you can start
to incorporate it into your life too.
We’re going to start with a thing.
For the sake of picking something
that is around us right now,
we're going to go with the light bulb.
Omnipresent in today's world.
Something we don't show
gratitude for, right?
Like we don’t stop and go like,
I'm so grateful for this light bulb.
But if you can think about the progress
that light bulbs have made over time,
if you can think about what
it can do for our mood,
look at this stage.
Look at what lighting can do.
It is remarkable.
And even if you just think,
“Wow, that’s dope,”
as a passing thought like that
makes a huge difference.
And not to mention what it can do for you.
The fact that it just lights up
a room when you need it to.
So when you go to bed tonight,
think about the light bulb
just for a second.
It will make a difference.
Alright, now a person.
Maybe the person sitting
next to you stole the seat
that you thought you were going to sit in.
Maybe they cut you off in line.
If you ever need a reason to think
"How I could appreciate that person more,"
could you ever look at somebody and say,
"I would have done better
with your circumstances,
with the entirety of your life
up to this moment"?
No, it's an impossible
question to say yes to.
That's the easiest way
to appreciate someone else more.
So what appreciation
will do for you in closing?
My wife despises mayonnaise.
Hi, babe.
My wife despises mayonnaise,
and that is fine.
This is not absolute.
The world is full of horrible,
horrible things.
Appreciation is not absolute.
But when it comes
to the horrible things in life,
the more we can understand
and appreciate what is happening,
the more we can appreciate
what we are capable of
when it comes to change together.
Appreciation will make you happier
on a consistent basis.
It will bring more wonder,
you will be more present,
you will take less for granted
when you show appreciation
on a consistent basis.
It will allow you to encourage others
and see the differences between us
as reasons to believe in each other.
Is this something
that the world needs right now?
A better understanding
for the how and why of everything?
Maybe a reason to look at things
skeptically from a different perspective?
[Wing night.
Do you think it's a trap?]
Might this be better for us
to take a bit less for granted
on a day-to-day basis?
I vote yes.
But then again, I firmly believe
in what we [are] capable of collectively
when we wholeheartedly ...
can appreciate the world
that we exist in together.
Thank you.
(Applause)
