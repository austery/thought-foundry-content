Hello
 my
 friends.
 Today
 is
 February
 14th


and
 this
 is
 Markets
 Weekly.
 So,
 this


past
 week
 was
 a
 very
 volatile
 week
 in


markets.
 As
 we've
 been
 discussing
 over


the
 recent
 weeks,
 it
 really
 seemed
 to
 me


that
 the
 market
 was
 losing
 momentum.


Now,
 this
 past
 week,
 we
 saw
 the
 S&P
 500


lose
 the
 50-day
 moving
 average.
 On


Friday,
 it
 came
 very
 close
 to
 losing
 the


100
 day
 moving
 average
 as
 well.
 That


kind
 of
 reminded
 me
 of
 a
 wise
 person
 who


traded
 through
 the.com
 boom
 and
 bust


that
 during
 the
 dot
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 went


broke
 selling
 it
 and
 a
 few
 years
 later


even
 more
 people
 went
 broke
 buying
 it.


Now
 I'm
 getting
 the
 sense
 just
 a
 guess


that
 we
 we
 probably
 have
 to
 test
 the
 200


day
 moving
 average
 around
 6500.
 Um


because
 we
 really
 this
 trend
 doesn't


doesn't
 look
 that
 great.
 This
 past
 week


we
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 tier
 one
 data.
 We
 got


the
 non-farmms
 payroll
 spread.
 We
 got


retail
 sales
 and
 we
 also
 got
 CPI.
 So


first
 let's
 talk
 about
 the
 data
 and


secondly
 I
 started
 using
 cloud
 AI
 last


week.
 Of
 course
 we
 saw
 huge
 amounts
 of


selling
 and
 the
 SAS
 stocks
 and
 even
 some


wealth
 management
 stocks
 everyone
 uh


that
 all
 the
 stocks
 that
 were
 perceived


to
 be
 disrupted
 by
 AI.
 So
 I
 had
 to
 try


the
 latest
 AI
 myself
 and
 I'm
 beginning


to
 think
 that
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 be
 very


good
 for
 bonds.
 All
 right,
 starting
 with


the
 data.


So
 we
 got
 a
 huge
 three
 huge
 prints
 last


week.
 First
 of
 all,
 of
 course,
 the


non-formms
 per
 print.
 The
 January
 print


was
 delayed
 until
 last
 week
 and
 it
 was


much
 better
 than
 expected.
 However,
 it


also
 came
 with
 the
 annual
 benchmark


revisions
 and
 the
 benchmark
 revisions


basically
 erased
 1
 million
 jobs
 created


last
 year.
 So,
 as
 we've
 been
 discussing


before,
 the
 market
 really
 doesn't
 care


about
 revisions.
 It
 only
 cares
 about
 the


monthly
 prints.
 If
 the
 monthly
 prints


last
 year
 were
 accurate,
 we
 would
 have


had
 zero
 or
 negative
 monthly
 prints.
 Uh


but
 and
 that
 would
 have
 been
 very


upsetting
 to
 the
 markets.
 But
 um
 now


that
 we
 a
 year
 later
 we
 revised
 them
 all


away,
 the
 market
 really
 doesn't
 care.


What
 it
 does
 care
 about
 though
 is
 that


it
 seems
 like
 the
 job
 market
 is


improving.
 So
 the
 January
 report
 was


better
 than
 expected
 and
 maybe
 it
 will


be
 revised
 away
 a
 year
 from
 now
 but
 at


the
 moment
 it's
 better
 than
 expected
 and


the
 market
 is
 going
 to
 perceive
 that
 to


be
 good
 and
 that
 uh
 the
 economy
 is
 less


likely
 to
 go
 into
 recession
 but
 it
 also


of
 course
 reduces
 the
 odds
 of
 Fed
 rate


cuts.


Now
 we
 also
 got
 the
 retail
 sales
 and
 CPI


last
 week
 but
 before
 we
 talk
 about
 that


we
 have
 to
 mention
 a
 little
 bit
 about


seasonal
 adjustments.
 So
 throughout
 the


year
 data
 is
 uneven
 because
 of
 seasonal


effects.
 For
 example,
 uh
 people
 you
 tend


to
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 shopping
 in
 November
 and


December.
 That's
 a
 big
 holiday
 season.


So
 retail
 sales
 there
 are
 going
 to
 be
 a


lot
 more.
 And
 in
 January,
 people
 tend
 to


reset
 their
 p
 to
 reset
 their
 prices.
 For


example,
 if
 you're
 a
 company
 and
 you


want
 to
 raise
 or
 lower
 prices
 on
 your


products
 or
 services,
 you
 tend
 to
 do


that
 in
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 year.
 So


there
 is
 some
 seasonality
 to
 how
 these


this
 data
 is
 computed
 and
 to
 make
 data


more
 comparable
 monthtomonth
 uh


economists
 or
 statistitians
 tend
 to
 do


these
 seasonal
 adjustments.
 So
 keep
 that


in
 mind
 when
 thinking
 about
 the
 data.
 So


for
 retail
 sales
 the
 data
 was
 much
 lower


than
 expected.
 they
 were
 basically
 flat


monthtomonth
 and
 some
 people
 think
 that


could
 be
 due
 to
 aggressive
 seasonal


adjustments
 which
 are
 difficult
 to
 make


because
 of
 course
 the
 economy
 is


changing
 um
 behavioral
 changes
 and
 so


sometimes
 seasonal
 adjustments
 can
 be


overdone
 or
 underdone.
 Now
 moving
 on
 to


CPI
 data
 CPI
 was
 better
 than
 expected


but
 still
 at
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 it's


still
 about
 you
 know
 2
 and
 a.5%
 above


the
 Fed's
 target.
 Uh,
 one
 thing
 to
 note


of
 course
 is
 that
 companies
 do
 raise


their
 prices
 in
 January
 and
 so
 these


seasonal
 adjustments
 make
 the
 January


print
 uh
 less
 accurate
 than
 than
 other


prints
 as
 well.
 So
 all
 in
 all
 though


this
 is
 I
 know
 data
 that
 is
 you
 know


kind
 of
 positive
 right
 you
 have
 better


than
 expected
 job
 growth
 and
 you
 have


inflation
 that's
 coming
 down
 but
 of


course
 the
 market
 didn't
 seem
 to
 really


care
 about
 this
 they
 were
 really
 more


cared
 about
 uh
 what
 seemed
 to
 be


happening
 in
 the
 AI
 world
 and
 that
 is


the
 AI
 is
 cannibalizing
 uh
 current


companies.
 So
 that
 brings
 us
 to
 our
 next


topic.


So,
 I've
 talked
 about
 AI
 before.
 I


started
 trying
 to
 use
 AI
 to
 help
 me
 with


my
 workload.
 And
 in
 the
 beginning,
 it


was
 very
 disappointing.
 So,
 I
 asked
 AI


to
 do
 basic
 things
 like,
 yo,
 tell
 me


when
 are
 speaking.
 And
 it
 really


couldn't
 do
 that.
 It
 was
 amazing
 to
 me


that
 I
 asked
 it
 to
 go
 on
 the
 Federal


Reserve's
 website
 to
 look
 up
 who's
 going


to
 be
 speaking
 this
 week,
 and
 it
 could


not
 do
 that.
 So,
 that
 was
 very


disappointing.
 But
 last
 week
 we
 had
 the


release
 of
 the
 latest
 cloud
 model
 and
 we


also
 had
 carnage
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 software
 as


a
 service
 companies.
 The
 market
 or
 at


least
 people
 who
 follow
 this
 was


thinking
 that
 the
 latest
 AI
 is
 really


going
 to
 be
 very
 destructive
 to
 the


value
 of
 these
 companies.
 Maybe
 there's


more
 competition.
 Uh
 maybe
 uh
 consumers


are
 going
 to
 u
 move
 to
 bespoke
 AI


created
 vibecoded
 platforms
 and
 so


forth.
 We
 even
 saw
 some
 wealth


management
 companies
 like
 Schwabs
 go
 up


aggressively
 because
 maybe
 AI
 can
 uh


provide
 tax
 efficient
 strategies
 in


place
 of
 wealth
 advisors.
 So
 again
 I
 had


to
 try
 this
 for
 myself.
 So
 I
 signed
 up


for
 the
 cloud
 max
 plan.
 So
 that's
 like


$100
 a
 month
 and
 got
 to
 use
 it.
 So
 what


did
 I
 use
 it
 for?
 Well
 as
 you
 guys
 know


I
 am
 writing
 the
 second
 edition
 to
 my


book
 central
 banking
 101.
 Uh
 the
 last


one
 was
 5
 years
 ago
 and
 so
 between
 then


and
 now
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 happened.
 So


I've
 updated
 all
 the
 data,
 added
 a
 whole


bunch
 of
 new
 sections
 about,
 you
 know,


the
 Silicon
 Valley
 bust,
 uh,
 Silicon


Valley
 bank
 bust,
 you
 know,
 Treasury


buybacks,
 QT,
 all
 that
 stuff.
 So
 I


basically
 updated
 everything
 and
 I
 felt


like
 I
 was
 basically
 done
 with
 the


manuscript.
 So
 usually
 what
 I
 would
 do


is
 I
 would
 hire
 an
 editor,
 a
 freelancer,


and
 pay
 him
 a
 few
 thousand
 to
 go
 through


this.
 And
 I
 would
 also
 hire
 some
 artists


to
 make
 a
 new
 book
 cover
 for for
 a
 few


hundred.
 And
 these
 are
 people
 that
 I


would
 source
 through
 upwork.com.


basically
 sites
 that
 post
 for


freelancers.


But
 this
 time
 I
 decided
 I
 would
 give
 AI


a
 try
 since
 that's
 what
 all
 the
 cool


kids
 are
 doing
 right
 now.
 So
 I
 uploaded


everything
 into
 cloud
 and
 asked
 him
 to


kind
 of
 you
 know
 be
 my
 editor
 and


proofread
 it.
 It
 said
 he
 said
 that
 it


would
 take
 6
 hours
 and
 so
 uh
 I
 waited


for
 6
 hours
 and
 what
 I
 got
 back
 was
 you


know


I
 guess
 he
 gave
 me
 like
 a
 few


suggestions
 updated
 some
 data
 points
 and


things
 like
 that
 some
 very
 general


stuff.
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 actually
 pretty


uh
 you
 know
 just
 meh
 not not
 that


special
 but
 you
 know
 maybe
 it's
 my


fault.
 Maybe
 I'm
 not
 prompting
 cloud


correctly.


So
 uh
 this
 is
 what
 I
 did.
 I
 prompted
 him


in
 a
 more
 precise
 way.
 I
 said
 could
 you


look
 at
 the
 reviews
 that
 I
 that
 are


posted
 on
 good
 readads
 on
 Amazon
 and


there
 are a
 lot
 of
 reviews
 and
 can
 you


bearing
 bring
 bearing
 that
 feedback
 in


mind
 can
 you
 go
 through
 the
 manuscript


and
 you
 can
 you
 give
 me
 some
 suggestions


and
 also
 just
 you
 know
 broad
 suggestions


as
 to
 what
 where
 I
 could
 do
 better
 and


so
 forth
 like
 that
 so
 this
 time
 it
 only


took
 you
 know
 a
 few
 minutes
 maybe
 was


it's
 already
 in
 his
 me
 memory
 or


something
 like
 that
 and
 he
 came
 back


with
 actually
 something
 that
 was
 pretty


helpful
 gave
 me
 a
 list
 of
 suggestions


gave
 me
 a
 separate
 word
 document


detailing


And
 you
 know
 looking
 through
 it
 some
 of


them
 were
 not
 that
 great
 stylistic
 of


course
 some
 of
 them
 were
 pretty
 good.


One
 of
 them
 for
 example
 was
 that
 in
 your


reviews
 people
 suggest
 you
 having
 a


glossery
 glossery
 so
 that
 they
 can
 look


back
 look
 up
 these
 acronyms
 QT
 FOMC
 uh


stuff
 like
 that.
 That
 was
 pretty
 good


suggestion.
 And
 some
 of
 them
 also


suggested
 that
 hey
 maybe
 you
 could
 have


summary
 chapter
 bullet
 points.
 you
 know,


kind
 of
 like
 a
 textbook,
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 textbook,
 you
 kind
 of
 give
 you
 a


summary
 as
 to
 what
 you
 should
 be
 what


you
 should
 have
 learned
 from
 this


chapter.
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 a
 pretty


good
 suggestion
 as
 well.
 And
 so
 I
 asked


Cloud,
 could
 you
 do
 that
 for
 me?
 And


like
 just
 like
 that,
 they
 created


wonderfully
 made
 glossery,
 wonderfully


made
 bullet
 points,
 and
 I
 thought
 that


was
 that
 was
 pretty
 cool.


I'm
 guessing
 that
 it
 could
 do
 more
 to


help
 me
 with
 my
 manuscript,
 but
 I'm


probably
 not
 prompting
 it
 well
 enough.


It
 did
 tell
 me
 though
 that
 it
 was
 very


good
 and
 well
 written
 and
 so
 I
 think


it's
 just
 part
 of
 its
 job.
 Um,
 like
 any


employee,


um,
 when
 I
 went
 to
 ask
 it
 about
 helping


me
 create
 a
 new
 cover
 for
 my
 updated


version,
 I
 gave
 it
 my
 prior
 cover
 and,


you
 know,
 gave
 it
 some
 ideas
 and
 it


immediately
 basically
 like
 Grock
 gave
 me


a
 number
 of
 ideas
 and
 ways
 to
 pursue
 and


that's
 actually
 exactly
 what
 my
 like
 a


real
 human
 cover
 designer
 would
 have


done.
 he
 would
 have
 given
 me
 a
 few


design
 choices
 and
 then
 I
 would
 have,


you
 know,
 decided
 which
 one
 to
 go
 and


and
 how
 to
 advance
 it.
 So,
 I'm
 probably


just
 going
 to
 use
 cloud
 as
 an
 editor.
 I


think
 it's
 really
 good
 enough
 and


honestly
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 some
 of
 the


human
 it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 know
 if
 the


human
 editors
 that
 I
 hire
 are
 good
 or


not
 until
 after
 the
 fact.
 But
 for
 the


artistic
 stuff,
 I
 think
 I'm
 still
 going


to
 hire
 a
 real
 designer.
 I
 think
 having


that
 human
 artistic
 touch
 is
 something


that
 I'm
 not
 really
 sure
 that
 Cloud
 can


fully
 do
 right
 now.
 The
 covers
 he's


shown
 me
 is
 are
 very
 good.
 Um,
 but
 I


guess
 I'm
 just
 not
 confident
 enough
 in


my
 own
 judgment
 and
 prefer
 someone
 who


who
 I
 a
 proper
 artist
 to
 do
 that.
 But


that
 immediately
 got
 me
 thinking
 as
 to


just
 what
 the
 implications
 of
 this
 are.


So
 just,
 you
 know,
 first
 first


principle,
 first
 level
 thinking.


So
 I
 would
 have
 spent
 a
 few
 thousand
 on


a
 editor,
 freelance
 editor
 and
 now
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 do
 that.
 I'm
 going
 to
 use


cloud
 instead.
 Cloud
 which
 costs
 $100
 a


month
 which
 of
 course
 is
 does
 not
 cover


its
 operating
 costs
 right
 cloud


anthropic
 continues
 to
 lose
 money.
 So


first
 impact
 of
 course
 is
 that
 I
 get


fast
 service
 and
 better
 service
 like


goods
 and
 services
 are
 produced
 uh
 by


cloud
 AI
 and
 immediately
 everything
 is


is
 uh
 my
 readers
 supposedly
 benefit
 and


and
 I
 benefit
 as
 well.
 Uh
 however
 this


is
 not
 really
 going
 to
 show
 up
 in
 GDP


data
 because
 I'm
 just
 playing
 cloud
 $100


a
 month
 and
 cloud
 is
 losing
 money.
 It's


kind
 of
 like
 how
 people
 who
 use
 AI
 and


create
 all
 sorts
 of
 funny
 videos
 and


memes.
 These
 are
 actually
 goods
 and


services
 that
 are
 produced
 but
 of
 course


you
 don't
 really
 pay
 for
 them
 and
 so
 and


they
 people
 don't
 pay
 to
 see
 them
 and


and
 so
 you
 don't
 really
 impact
 GDP.


However,
 uh
 this
 editor
 that
 I
 would


have
 hired
 he's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 hired.


So
 that
 is
 going
 to
 increase


unemployment
 and
 actually
 reduce
 GDP


because
 he
 would
 have
 produced
 goods
 and


services
 that
 I
 paid
 for,
 but
 he's
 not.


And
 so
 maybe
 someone
 else
 hires
 him,


maybe
 not.
 My
 guess
 is
 just
 on
 a
 macro


scale
 on
 the
 margins,
 people
 like
 him


are
 just
 not
 going
 to
 be
 working.
 And
 so


obviously
 slight
 upward
 pressure
 on


unemployment,


improvement
 in
 goods
 and
 services,
 the


quality
 of
 it,
 but
 improvements
 that


don't
 show
 up
 in
 GDP.


So
 you
 know
 that
 that's
 kind
 of
 an


interesting
 combin
 combination,
 but


honestly
 kind
 of
 common
 when
 we
 think


about
 technology
 over
 the
 past
 few


decades,
 right?
 So
 your
 your
 iPhone,
 for


example,
 is
 much
 better
 than
 it
 was
 10


years
 ago.
 It
 doesn't
 really
 cost
 that


much
 more.
 So
 when
 you
 think
 about


paying
 for
 stuff,
 it
 doesn't
 really
 show


up
 in
 GDP,
 but
 the
 quality
 of
 the


services
 is
 better.
 Now
 I
 think
 this


seems
 to
 be
 an
 extension
 of
 that.
 Now


thinking
 more
 broadly,
 let's
 say
 how


does
 this
 impact
 businesses
 and
 so


forth.
 I
 give
 you
 an
 example
 of
 what
 I'm


doing
 with
 my
 uh
 with
 you
 know
 the
 the


second
 edition
 of
 the
 book.
 But
 you


could
 generalize
 this
 for
 example
 to


writing
 a
 newsletter,
 right?
 So
 if
 I
 use


AI
 to
 help
 me
 with
 my
 workload
 and


sometimes
 I
 do
 uh
 for
 example
 the
 f
 the


Fed
 released
 a
 lot
 of
 confidential


documents
 I
 believe
 in
 2020
 and
 they
 do


that
 on
 a
 5-year
 lag
 and
 so
 I
 had
 AI


look
 through
 it
 to
 see
 if
 there
 was


anything
 interesting
 now
 otherwise
 I


either
 would
 not
 have
 done
 this
 or
 it


would
 have
 taken
 me
 a
 long
 time
 because


it
 literally
 hundreds
 and
 hundreds
 of


pages
 to
 look
 through
 and
 the
 eye
 was


helpful
 in
 looking
 through
 that.
 So
 that


helps
 me
 and
 that
 it
 uh
 you
 know
 makes


me
 a
 little
 bit
 smarter
 and
 more
 able
 to


provide
 a
 slightly
 better
 product
 to


people
 who
 subscribe.
 Uh
 however
 I'm
 not


able
 to
 charge
 more
 for
 that
 and
 it
 does


not
 increase
 the
 amount
 of
 subscribers.


So
 it's
 an
 improvement
 but
 it
 really


doesn't
 show
 up
 in
 GDP.
 So
 I
 think


there's
 that's
 probably
 going
 to
 be


pretty
 common
 for
 um
 a
 lot
 of


industries.
 Just
 thinking
 back
 through


the
 industries
 that
 I've
 been
 involved


in
 in
 the
 past.
 Uh
 for
 example,
 my
 first


job
 was
 at
 a
 law
 firm.
 And
 at
 a
 law


firm,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 work
 uh
 that
 lawyers


do,
 uh
 it
 depends,
 but
 broadly
 speaking,


if
 you're
 a
 junior
 associate


in
 litigation,
 you
 would
 be
 spending
 a


lot
 of
 time
 researching
 legal
 cases
 on


West
 Law,
 Lexus
 Nexus,
 or
 something
 like


that.
 EI
 can
 definitely
 do
 that
 very


well
 and
 much
 better
 than
 any
 associate


can.
 Um
 if
 you
 are
 someone
 on
 the


transactional
 side,
 you
 would
 be
 editing


contracts,
 for example.
 Uh,
 honestly,
 it


would
 be
 basically
 getting
 a
 contract


that
 the
 firm
 did
 for
 like
 JP
 Morgan
 and


then
 updating
 the
 terms
 for
 for
 a


contract
 for
 a
 Morgan
 Stanley
 deal,
 you


know,
 find
 and
 replace,
 literally
 find


and
 replace
 JP
 Morgan,
 Morgan
 Sally,


updating
 the
 numbers,
 you
 know,
 100


million
 to
 200
 million
 and
 the


conforming
 changes
 in
 case
 of
 law


change,
 stuff
 like
 that.
 BI
 can
 do
 that


really
 well
 as
 well.
 So,
 from
 a
 junior


social
 perspective,
 you're
 not
 going
 to


need
 as
 many
 of
 them.
 uh
 from
 a
 see
 a


partner
 senior
 associate
 perspective


it's
 going
 to
 make
 you
 a
 lot
 more


efficient.
 So
 um
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day


though
 what
 would
 happen
 it
 seems
 again


first
 thing
 that
 will
 happen
 is
 that


it's
 going
 to
 save
 you
 time


and


one
 thing
 you
 can
 do
 with
 your
 time
 is


to
 do
 other
 productive
 things
 or
 you


could
 simply
 shrink
 your
 time


on
 an
 individual
 basis.
 It's
 me
 watching


more
 TV
 on
 a
 firm
 level
 basis.
 It's


having
 smaller
 headcount
 which


anecdotally
 we
 hear
 uh
 firms
 are
 doing.


Now
 from
 a
 productivity
 standpoint,
 the


firm
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 charging
 less


because
 it,
 you
 know,
 it's
 using
 AI
 more


rather
 than
 junior
 associates.


Uh
 okay,
 so
 law
 firm
 is
 a
 little
 bit


different
 because
 they
 build
 by
 the


hour.
 But
 generally
 a
 corporation,
 it's


not
 going
 to
 adjust
 its
 pricing
 revenue


structure
 immediately.
 So,
 it's
 probably


going
 to
 be
 reaping
 those
 efficiency


gains
 through
 higher
 profits


and
 lower
 higher
 profits
 to
 lower


headcount.
 Um,
 but
 when
 you
 think
 to
 the


second
 stage
 of
 this
 though,
 I
 mean,
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 there's
 not
 going
 to


be
 more
 aggregate
 demand,
 right?
 It's


kind
 of
 like
 going
 to
 my
 newsletter


example.
 If
 I'm
 able
 to
 produce
 this


more
 efficiently,


uh,
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily
 mean
 that
 I'm


going
 to
 have
 more
 subscribers.
 And
 so


from
 a
 law
 firm
 or
 any
 other
 services


business,
 even
 though
 you
 are
 more


efficient,
 you
 need
 fewer
 people,
 can


have
 higher
 profits,
 it
 doesn't


necessarily
 mean
 that
 you
 expand
 your


customers,
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 you
 can


charge
 higher
 prices.
 So


first
 stop
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 GDP
 neutral


because
 you
 continue
 to
 produce
 the
 same


amount
 of
 services
 and
 instead
 of
 and
 uh


you
 have
 higher
 profits
 but
 then
 again


uh
 it's
 kind
 of
 you're
 kind
 of


cannibalizing
 what
 you
 would
 have
 uh


what
 the
 what
 the
 worker
 you
 laid
 off


would
 have
 produced.


Um
 but
 afterwards
 though
 you
 know
 unless


you
 have
 greater
 demand
 so
 that
 you


actually
 produce
 more
 goods
 and
 services


you're
 not
 going
 to
 increase
 your
 aggate


GDP


and
 if
 you're
 firing
 workers
 you're


going
 to
 reduce
 your
 aggate
 demand


eventually
 in
 the
 economy.
 So
 it
 seems


like
 this
 would
 ultimately
 be
 on
 the


second
 step
 just
 kind
 of
 demand


negative.
 it
 would
 actually
 shrink
 GDP


uh
 because
 it
 doesn't
 actually
 increase


the
 aggregate
 demand
 of
 the
 economy


because
 you're
 firing
 more
 people
 who


who
 in
 theory
 would
 have
 been
 sources
 of


demand.


At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 everyone
 will


have
 higher
 quality
 goods,
 higher


quality
 services,
 right?
 you
 would
 be


able
 to
 access
 like
 some
 of the
 smartest


what
 like
 the
 smartest
 advice
 smartest


uh
 information
 you
 could
 with
 a
 click
 of


a
 button
 either
 through
 AI
 directly
 or


through
 some
 kind
 of
 professional
 who
 is


employing
 AI
 so
 your
 quality
 of
 life


will
 be
 higher


um
 but
 it's
 I
 I
 don't
 see
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 going
 to
 show
 up
 in
 GDP
 for
 the


reasons
 I
 I
 cited
 earlier
 so
 that's
 kind


of
 an
 interesting
 um
 conundrum
 and
 the


implications
 for
 markets
 is
 that
 well


some
 of
 course
 we
 already
 see
 this


creative
 destruction
 happening
 right
 now


companies
 first
 again
 are
 going
 to
 have


higher
 profit
 margins
 so
 that's
 good
 but


then
 some
 companies
 will
 be
 completely


superseded
 and
 so
 that's
 bad
 for
 them


eventually
 though
 you're
 going
 to
 have


competition
 and
 those
 high
 profit


margins
 will
 be
 competed
 lower
 you
 know


it
 does
 level
 the
 playing
 field
 a
 little


bit
 and
 that
 smaller
 companies
 will
 have


access
 to
 tools
 and
 resources
 that
 they


would
 not
 have
 had
 access
 to
 before


So
 if
 you
 have
 higher
 unemployment,


you
 know,
 and
 uh
 maybe
 massive


disruption
 in
 the
 financial
 markets
 as


we
 sort
 through
 all
 this
 creative


disruption,
 who's
 winning,
 who's
 losing,


and
 even
 the
 winners
 eventually
 have
 low


profits,
 that
 seems
 like
 it's
 going
 to


be
 stock
 market
 negative.
 So
 when
 you


put
 that
 together,
 I'm
 beginning
 to


think
 that
 the
 ultimate
 AI
 trade
 is
 um


is
 going
 to
 be
 bonds.
 you're
 going
 to


have
 a
 lot
 more
 rate
 cuts,
 lower
 employ


un un
 higher
 unemployment,
 lower
 stock


prices,
 more
 financial


market
 volatility.
 So,
 I'm
 getting
 the


sense
 that
 maybe
 that
 is
 going
 to


actually
 be
 the
 ultimate
 good
 AI
 trade,


but
 we'll
 see.
 In
 any
 case,
 uh
 those
 are


my
 thoughts
 right
 now.
 Thanks
 so
 much


for
 tuning
 in
 and
 I'll
 talk
 to
 you
 next


week.
