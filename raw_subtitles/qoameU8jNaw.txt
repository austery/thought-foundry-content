I study the science of aging,
and my book is called "True Age."
My interest in the science of aging
probably started when I was quite young
because my father was
fairly old when I was born.
He was in his mid 50s,
and so I became really aware
of the aging process from a young age.
So at a time when maybe most
kids weren't contemplating
their parents' disease risk and mortality,
it was something I was always
inherently concerned about.
And then when I actually went to college,
I learned there was an
entire scientific field
focused on trying to
understand the aging process
and potentially even intervene in it.
And this really drove me to
work on the science of aging.
So my current research
really focuses on trying
to actually quantify or measure aging.
So can we take all of the
cellular molecular changes
that people have undergone
and actually give them a sense
of how they're doing in
terms of the aging process?
Are the aging slower than we would expect,
or are they aging faster
than we would expect?
We all age, but we don't
all age at the same rate.
So my lab is really interested in
can we actually put a number to that?
Can we measure how fast
or slow a given person
might be aging?
And we think this is really critical
because it probably has
implications for their risk
of disease in the future,
their remaining life expectancy
and other things that we all care about
in terms of our health.
I think a lot of people
don't realize how much power
we actually have over our aging process.
So a lot of people think,
"Oh, my life expectancy
or my risk of getting something
like cancer or heart disease
is due to genetics or
it's just gonna happen."
But we actually have a lot of ability
to kind of modulate our potential risks,
or at least the timing perhaps
of when these diseases might occur.
So by actually having people
understand the aging process,
the biology that goes into
it and why that's important
for disease, we think that
this will actually help people
take meaningful steps to
slow the rate of aging
and increase what we
call their health span
or their kind of time of life
expectancy free from disease.

- [Announcer] "Chapter
1: How we measure age:
Biological versus Chronological."
(air whooshes)
- Most people think of age or aging
in terms of chronological time.
So we all know how many
years we've been alive,
and we usually measure our
aging in terms of that time,
so months, days, years since we were born.
And we put a lot of emphasis
and importance on this measure,
but actually this isn't
the number that counts.
So the reason we've become
so fixated on this idea
of chronological age is
because it's actually tied
to what we consider this
biological aging process.
So over time, living systems like humans
or any other organism,
actually kind of degrade
and become less functional over time.
And we think of this as kind of
the biological aging process.
So how are our cells functioning worse
than perhaps they were before,
and how have our bodies
kind of changed over time?
And the important thing is
that, unlike chronological time,
this is something that's
potentially malleable.
So we know this from looking
at different species.
So you can compare a 10-year-old
dog to a 10-year-old human
and clearly the rate at which
their bodies have declined
over that time is quite different.
And we even know among humans,
you can look at two people
who are, say, 50 years
old chronologically,
and clearly they may not
look the same in terms
of their overall health
status and overall aging rate.
So really it becomes
important to understand
the biological aging
process, how far we've each
kind of diverged over time
and what this might mean
for our future health.
So there's actually a debate
in the field whether aging
is universal and if every
organism actually ages.
Most scientists actually think that aging
is a universal thing among living systems,
and living systems will
inherently change over time
and decline.
But some of them actually
do this at such a slow rate,
what we call negligible senescence,
that we actually can't observe
aging in those systems.
So usually to kind of tell
how fast different organisms
are aging, we look at their,
what we call survival curves.
So do you see an increased
risk of mortality
in a population as a function of time?
And we think of that as
kind of the overall rate
at which that type of
species or type of animal
or plant is actually aging.
So usually when we think of
changes associated with old age,
we think of functional changes,
so things we can actually see in ourselves
and in the people around us.
So we think of changes even in things like
how fast you can run or walk
or your ability to go upstairs
or just how much energy you have.
And then we also think of
these in terms of the wrinkles
on our face, graying, or loss of hair,
and also, to some degree,
the diseases that we actually
see manifest with aging.
But in reality, these aren't where aging
is actually starting.
These are what we would call the emergence
or the manifestations of aging.
We really think aging is
starting at a much lower level,
so at the molecular and cellular level.
So if I were to ask
someone how old they were,
their immediate response is going to be
however many candles they blew
out in their last birthday.
It's the number on their driver's
license or their passport.
And really this number
doesn't hold that much meaning
except that it happens to be correlated
with this concept of biological aging,
which is actually what
we really care about.
And what scientists mean by biological age
is really the degree to which
your biology has changed
over a given amount of time.
And we think these changes
are gonna be maladaptive,
they're gonna lead to more dysfunction,
more decline, and ultimately more disease.
A really important thing
in the science of aging
is being able to actually quantify
or estimate the aging process.
So this is really where
we get into this idea
of can we measure biological age.
There's three major advantages
that scientists have found
for trying to quantify
or trying to measure
the aging process.
So the first one is just
understanding the science of aging,
understanding the biology
of why systems age,
what leads to this and how to intervene.
The second is it provides an endpoint
for any clinical trials or any science
that is actually trying to
intervene in this process
to say whether they were
actually successful at doing so.
And then probably the third,
which most people might
care the most about,
is it actually gives
people an understanding
of their overall health and is important
for what we call risk stratification.
So understanding who might be more at risk
of developing these different
age-related diseases,
and from there actually either
working with a physician
or reassessing your lifestyle
and behavioral factors
to figure out if you can
actually slow that process
and monitor it in real time.
And there isn't one right way to do this.
And you can imagine you
can use different types
of data to do this.
So some people might actually just use
your functional abilities
or the number of diseases
that you've been diagnosed
with as kind of an indices
of how much you've changed over time.
Another concept is this idea
that we call phenotypic age,
which really boils down to
kind of how you're changing
on a physiological level.
These are things that you
would go to your physician
for your annual appointment
and probably are already
getting measured in a blood draw.
So they're capturing
things like functioning
of different organs
including our liver, kidney.
They capture metabolic
health, they capture lipids
and to some degree they're
also capturing things
like our inflammation and immune profile.
So when we put these all together,
you can actually get an overall number
or show on a holistic phenotypic level
how you look compared to
other people your age.
They give us an idea of how
your different organ systems
are operating and kind of working together
to give you your overall health.
And then there are even
more kind of specific ways
you can do this on a molecular
level or a cellular level
where you're really diving
into very specific types
of variables that we think
are where the aging process
might actually be starting.
And we think this measure
of aging is really important
because it captures the
physiological changes
that we actually think
precede the dysfunction
that we see arising in disease.
So we actually think that it's predictive
of future risk of disease,
and it's also close enough
or proximal enough to the disease
that it's actually gonna
be able to tell you
how you're doing.
So on average, we would
expect most people would gain
one year of phenotypic age
for every one year of chronological age.
So if you were to measure
yourself every year
on your birthday, we'd
expect it to increase
at one year every year.
However, ideally what you
would actually want to see
is that your phenotypic age is increasing
at a slower rate than
your chronological age.
And we would think of
this as a deceleration
or a slowing of the aging process.
There's not really a
right age or wrong age
to start measuring your phenotypic age.
So we also say it's never too late.
So a lot of people think,
"Well, I'm already too old,
or I've already developed a disease,
maybe it's not worth it to me."
But we actually find
that there's still a lot
of malleability in terms of someone's
phenotypic aging process
throughout the entire lifespan.
So we think that people of any age
should actually be monitoring this,
and you're probably already
getting these measures
when you go visit your
doctor on an annual basis.
So it's really easy to kind of
put these into the algorithm
and get one more variable
beyond what your doctor's gonna look at.
So typically when your doctor
looks at your lab tests,
they're gonna tell you if
any of these biomarkers
are in the kind of at
risk or abnormal range.
But that just gives you,
we think of that as almost
like there's high risk
and low risk, but there's
actually a whole spectrum
of how your physiology is behaving.
And there's a lot of
information in knowing
even if you haven't passed
that high-risk threshold,
are you close or are you closer to it
than we would expect for your age,
or how quickly are you approaching it?
So this can give you
additional information
beyond these traditional risk
measures that people look at.
Because of the way phenotypic age
or these other biological age measures
were actually derived, the average person
will have the same
biological or phenotypic age
as his or her chronological age.
If you looked at a population,
you'd expect to see
a normal distribution
where you find most people
are predicted to be the same biological
or phenotypic age as
they are chronologically.
But we know there's also
spread on either side.
And when we look at the
average, for instance,
United States population,
we see that kind of
that standard deviation
or how much people kind of
vary is around five years.
Granted, you can get extreme outliers,
so people who look 10 or
maybe even 20 years older
or younger than expected
for their chronological age,
but most people will fall in that
kind of plus or minus five years
of their chronological age.
If you have already visited your doctor
and you've got an annual blood test,
you probably can get your
phenotypic age test for free.
So there are online calculators that list
the nine biomarkers that you
actually need to calculate
your phenotypic age.
These are freely available on the web.
So all you would need to do is go and find
your most recent lab
tests, input the values
and the algorithm will actually produce
a phenotypic age measure for you.
So assuming you are going and getting
regular annual physicals with lab tests,
this is something you can already do.
And if not, you can visit your physician
or something like a
laboratory that offers a lot
of these blood-based tests
and get these for relatively little money.
And over time you can actually
try and modify your behaviors
and see year to year if you're seeing that
actually reflected in your biological age
as you track it over time.
Aging is the biggest risk
factor for most of the diseases
that people worry about, for
things like heart disease
and cancer and diabetes.
And scientists actually
think that rather than trying
to treat each of those
diseases individually,
if we were to actually slow the rate
at which people were
aging and slow the decline
in our different kind of organ
and physiological systems,
we could either prevent or
perhaps lessen the impact
of many of these diseases.
So it's not just giving
people a longer life,
but it's keeping them
healthy and functional
for as long as possible.
(gentle pensive music)
(air whooshes)
- [Announcer] "Chapter 2: How
we measure age: Epigenetic."
- People in the field
have actually come up
with what we might call
hallmarks of aging.
So one of these hallmarks
that my lab in particular
is very interested in is
this concept of epigenetics.
And epigenetics might not be a term
that everyone's familiar with.
We all know genetics,
so our kind of sequence of DNA
that gives rise to our different genes.
But the epigenetics is really
what I like to think of
as the operating system of this cell.
It's what gives each cell its different
kind of defining
characteristics in phenotype.
So even though the cells in your skin
and the cells in your
brain have essentially
the exact same DNA, what
makes them different
is the epigenome.
So it gives them their overall
function and structure.
And the epigenome is actually something
that has been studied in science
for quite a few decades now,
but the actual program or
system itself is so complex
that we're only just barely starting
to understand the meaning of a lot
of these changes that we see.
So the epigenome is usually written
in kind of chemical modifications.
So there's different forms of these.
And the one that's actually
studied perhaps the most
in aging, or at least in terms
of trying to quantify aging,
is this concept of DNA methylation.
So basically what DNA methylation is
is it's just a chemical tag that's added
to specific parts of your genome.
So you have the A, C, G and T,
and DNA methylation is actually added
when you have a C next to a G.
And the importance of
this is when it's added,
it actually closes off
that part of the genome.
So the genome kind of folds in on itself
and that part is no longer accessible.
So this is how cells know
which parts of the genome
to access and not access,
and this will be different for
all the different cell types.
The other thing though is that we know
this epigenetic program or
DNA methylation patterns
are very remodeled with aging.
So even though a skin cell
should have a specific pattern,
as people age, the pattern
actually gets messed up.
And we actually think
that this is giving rise
to dysfunction in the skin cell
or their losing their essential identity,
their ability to perform
their specific task.
Every cell in our body has
a very specific function,
and this function is really
dictated by the epigenome.
The problem is that with aging,
the epigenome becomes remodeled
either due to stress or random errors.
And what this actually produces
is that each cell is actually
going to lose its identity
and not function in the way
it was initially intended.
And over time, as more and more
cells become dysfunctional,
you can imagine how this
would produce dysfunction
at the organ level and eventually
at the whole system level.
One form of epigenetics is
actually called DNA methylation,
which is just a chemical modification
to different places throughout the genome.
So you have A C, G and T as
the different nucleotides
in our DNA, and when you
have a C next to a G,
they can have this chemical tag
that can basically turn
off regions of the genome.
So scientists actually
found that the pattern
of these chemical tags is
changed quite dramatically
with aging, and using things
like machine learning and AI,
we've actually been able to
predict how old someone appears
based on these patterns
of these chemical tags
or DNA methylation.
And this has been come to refer
to as the epigenetic clock,
which is basically just
a way to try and quantify
biological age based on
either gains or losses
in methylation at specific
regions throughout the genome.
And really we think that
the changes at this level,
this is what we would
consider the molecular level,
are what are giving rise
to the changes we see
at the phenotypic or physiological level.
So over time, cells actually
become less functional.
They actually are less likely to represent
what they were originally intended to do.
And we see this in many diseases.
So one instance might be cancer.
So cells that actually have
more rapid epigenetic changes
may be prone to be more cancerous.
And actually my lab has shown
that when you measure things
like an epigenetic clock,
we actually see that
it's highly accelerated
in tumors compared to the normal tissue.
We also see that the
different organs in our body
that are more prone to developing cancer
seem to be aging epigenetically
at a more rapid rate
than cells that are maybe
less prone to cancer.
Many people might be wondering,
"How do I actually get my
epigenetic age measured
or find out what the
epigenetic clock says for me?"
And right now there are some
direct-to-consumer products
that actually can provide this.
This is a lot more expensive still
than going and getting
your regular lab tests
because it relies on much
more advanced technology
to actually be able to
measure all these changes.
So typically if you were to use
a direct-to-consumer product
to measure your epigenetic
age, you would do this
through either a blood or saliva sample.
And the question is
whether that's actually
a really good proxy for
how your different systems
or organs are aging overall.
'Cause again, your epigenetic
age can be measured
within different cell types and organs.
That being said, the epigenetic
clock measured in blood
has been shown to be a good predictor
of things like remaining life
expectancy and disease risk.
And over time these algorithms
are gonna get better
and better at predicting things
and capturing aging overall
using epigenetic measures.
A number of people have
become interested in the field
of epigenetic clocks and
started to actually monitor
their epigenetic age over time.
And just like measures like pheno age
or other biological age indicators,
this can give people a way to kind
of track their overall aging process
and figure out how they can
change their health behaviors
to try and optimize that.
For people who wanna track epigenetic age
on what we call an n equals
one, so an individual level,
we still don't know exactly what changes
in epigenetic age represent.
So if you were to track it,
change something about your lifestyle,
or you know add a new regiment
and then see it a change
in your epigenetic age, it's
not clear what drove that
or if that actually represents
a change in your aging rate;
verse kind of the phenotypic
or physiological ones
where we know a little bit more
about what these markers represent.
That being said, there's a lot of interest
from the scientific community
in actually figuring out
what drives these epigenetic changes
and how we can manipulate and intervene,
because we actually think
the point of intervention
is gonna be better at this
level since we think aging
starts at a molecular level,
so to understand what drives
changes in epigenetic age
and what that really
represents functionally.
The one exciting thing actually
about epigenetic clocks
is they actually seem relevant
to a wide array of diseases.
So they are implicated
in things like cancer,
so cells that seem to be more accelerated
in terms of their epigenetic age
seem to be more prone to cancer.
But we also see it in other diseases
like Alzheimer's disease or diabetes
or even things like some of
the lung diseases that you see.
So really the amazing
thing is that this process
or this phenomenon is not disease specific
and actually might be a unifying driver
of diseases kind of across the board.
The thing that's most exciting to me
about studying the epigenome
and the epigenetic clock
is that this is actually
a really powerful tool
to understand some of the cellular changes
that we think are potentially
contributing to a wide array
of diverse diseases
across different tissues.
So we see the same signature
and same phenomenon
regardless of the cell
types we're looking at.
And then the other really exciting thing
is that this process, again,
seems to be something we can intervene in.
We know that it goes both ways
and that it actually is
something potentially amenable
to being reversed.
My one worry with people
constantly monitoring
and tracking their
biological age is that people
are going to inevitably want
to use this for biohacking.
And I think we can do this
up to a certain extent,
but we need to remember that none
of these measures are perfect.
We haven't perfectly
measured biological age,
and also the measure you use
might give you different answers.
So I think people shouldn't over-optimize
to a specific biological age measure.
And if you know that
the things you're doing
are good for health, so
again, these common things
like diet, exercise, sleep and stress
and you're seeing that reflect
in your biological age,
I think you can be confident
that that's probably a real result.
But the one concern is that people will go
and try a bunch of
therapeutics or supplements
just targeting this one number,
and really that's not the goal here.
In the end, it's really important
for people just to realize
how much power they actually have
in terms of impacting the way
in which they're gonna age
and impacting the risk of disease.
Our risks of disease are
not written in our genes.
Yes, we will probably all age,
and we're not going to
essentially stop that,
but the rate at which that happens
and the length of time that
you can maintain health
and optimal functioning really comes down
to a lot of what you do
in your everyday life.
(gentle pensive music)
(air whooshes)
- [Announcer] "Chapter
3: Is aging a disease?"
- There's a lot of debate in
the scientific field of aging
whether aging is actually disease
that should be treated
like we treat diseases.
My personal take on it is that aging
is not actually a disease in and of itself
but it's the process that
actually contributes the most
to many of the diseases we care about.
So that being said, I actually
think we should intervene
and try and treat or at
least slow the rate of aging,
but we shouldn't think of it as a disease
'cause there isn't a clear point
where you say you have
aged a specific amount
that you now have a disease.
And we are all aging
from the time we're born
to the time we die.
And ultimately what's important
is how do we slow this process in an idea
that will prevent many of the diseases
that people are actually trying to treat.
A lot of people think the
aging field is focused
on this concept of
immortality or curing death
or curing aging.
That is a little bit fringe
to I think a lot of the
science that's going on.
And really what the field is focusing on
is how can we prevent
the diseases of aging
and keep people healthy
for as long as possible.
And if that ends up
increasing life expectancy,
that's almost a bonus.
But the goal is not immortality.
Our bodies are set up to
function in a very specific way.
This is something we've evolved,
but over time that function does decline.
And this is what we actually see
in terms of manifestations of disease,
diseases really, once
your body has reached
a dysfunctional state in
terms of one type of process.
And the reason that our bodies
actually get to that point
is because of all the changes
we think that are accumulating
as a function of this aging process.
Granted, there can be other
things like an infection
or genetic kind of predisposition
that might give people a disease,
but most of the diseases like cancer,
cardiovascular disease,
Alzheimer's disease
are these progressive loss of function
in our various systems that
we think is directly driven
by the aging process.
So if we can actually
figure out how to slow
our aging rate internally, we think,
and actually science has shown,
that this will probably manifest in terms
of our external appearance as well.
Living systems are really remarkable.
Through evolution, we've evolved to have
this beautiful kind of coordination
and specificity that kind
of makes us who we are.
So cells have specific
roles, our organs are set up
to function a specific way
and this really gives us life.
However, all of these things
that are kind of determining
the function of these organs and cells
actually degrades with time.
So we think of this as kind
of the molecular changes
that enable cells to
function a certain way
are rewritten with aging.
And now cells actually
lose their specificity,
they become more dysfunctional.
As you accumulate more dysfunctional cells
in your tissues and organs,
those organs are now
not working the way they're
originally intended to.
And over time, as your
organs start to dysfunction,
you actually start seeing
this at the whole body level.
So we start seeing overall declines
in our kind of bigger functional aspects.
So just our ability to run for a bus,
or our ability to hear our
friend say something to us,
these bigger functional
attributes are actually degraded
with time due to all these small changes
that are accumulating at the
molecular and cellular level.
Living systems are also remarkable
in that we're actually open systems,
so we can take energy
in from our environment
and actually use that
to sustain ourselves.
So in general, non-living systems
will kind of degrade in
terms of this entropic change
at a fairly constant rate.
But actually our systems have adapted
to actually have a buffer, resilience.
We can use energy to
maintain our kind of function
and structure for much longer,
but over time this will
eventually get kind of overpowered
and we will still see
this kind of dysregulation
and functional decline as we
also see a loss of resilience.
Aging is really
personified by dysfunction,
and we see a lot of this in the diseases
that tend to arise with aging.
So one great example is
a disease like diabetes
where we actually see dysfunction
in terms of our metabolic health,
where we get this accumulation of glucose
throughout our circulation.
But there are other diseases of aging
that are also associated with dysfunction.
So things like cancer are actually
our own dysfunctional
cells that are not behaving
the way they were initially intended.
Many diseases of aging
can actually be attributed
to dysfunction, decline
in specific organ systems.
So something like
diabetes can be thought of
as a decline in our metabolic system.
Things like Alzheimer's disease
are declines in dysfunction
in our central nervous system.
And another disease of
aging called sarcopenia,
which is actually the muscle
wasting that we see with aging,
can be thought of as declines
in actually multiple systems
including our metabolic system
and also our musculoskeletal systems.
Until the science actually
up with drugs or treatments
to actually try and target aging,
lifestyle right now is
actually our best ticket
in terms of slowing our aging process.
And this is really because, again,
living systems are adaptive.
We adapt to our environment,
we adapt to the things we experience.
So you can actually boost
things like resilience
through different lifestyle behaviors.
So for instance, physical
activity or exercise
can actually increase our
resilience and buffer us
against further stressors down the road.
We also know that
different dietary regimens
can actually increase
our resilience as well
and we think slow the
aging process overall.
And these aren't new things.
These are things that
we've been told about
from, let's say, our
mothers or grandmothers,
you know, eat well, get good
sleep, exercise, don't smoke.
So these shouldn't be
a surprise to people,
but I think people don't realize
how much these actually impact
how fast they're gonna age
and also their propensity for developing
different age-related diseases.
(gentle pensive music)
(air whooshes)
- [Announcer] "Chapter 4:
"Can we reverse aging?"
- We actually think, as a science,
whether we can actually
figure out ways to slow
or perhaps even reverse
these biological changes
that actually matter
for the aging process.
We don't know to what extent
we can actually reverse aging
in a whole body, although we
do know that you can reverse
the age of a cell.
So this happens in development
when you have two cells
from a female and male that come together
and produce an entirely
new age-zero organism,
even though they came from parents
that perhaps were in their
20s or 30s or even 40s.
And we've actually found that in science
we can do this in a dish.
So we can activate specific factors
that can take, let's say, a
skin cell from a 75-year-old
and convert it back into something
that's almost indistinguishable
from a cell from an embryo.
So we know that, at least
at the cellular level,
this is possible.
The question is can you actually do that
in an adult organism?
For those of us that
are actually old enough
to get to go to our high school reunion,
let's say your 20 or
30-year-old high school reunion,
we know that if you were to go there,
not everyone looks like
they're at the same
chronological age, even
though they probably are.
Some people look exactly like they did
when you graduated high
school, so they haven't changed
since they were 18, whereas
there might be other people
who you don't even recognize.
And you look at them and you think,
"I can't possibly be that old,
we haven't aged that much."
So we know inherently
that people don't all age
at the same rate, and some of us are going
to be faster agers and some of
us are gonna be slower agers.
And ultimately the question is
how do you become a slow ager?
Like many of the things we've talked about
in terms of aging, the epigenome,
again, is highly dynamic.
These are things that can go,
we think, in both directions.
So you can increase epigenetic
age, but we've also shown
that you can actually
reverse this in cells.
So Shinya Yamanaka actually
won the Nobel Prize
for discovering four factors that,
when you overexpress these in cells,
it can convert an old cell
or basically any cell type
back into what looks like
an embryonic stem cell.
And later as scientists were
actually applying things
like the epigenetic clock to this data,
we found that not only are
you changing the cell type,
but you're also erasing
or essentially reversing
all those epigenetic changes
that we've actually used
to try and quantify biological age.
So then the question becomes
how do you do this in a body?
Can you actually what we call reprogram
or program cells from
an old epigenetic state
back into a younger epigenetic state?
And then the question becomes
what does this actually mean
for our physiology and our health?
So some people might actually say
that we have solved the aging
problem with cells in a dish.
We can age cells, and
we can reverse their age
and essentially reset them to an age zero.
And then people are now trying
to actually do this in an organism.
So right now to start out,
people are doing this in mice
where again, in different mouse models,
you can over express these four factors
commonly referred to as Yamanaka factors.
And the scientists have
actually observed that the mice
seem to have improvements in
different functional outcomes
and there perhaps might be an
increase in life expectancy,
although this needs to be
followed up a little bit more.
The most amazing thing about this science
is that we always thought
aging really happened
in one direction, that these
were just stochastic damage
that you couldn't go back and fix
because there was just so
widespread and so much of it,
and that the only thing you
could really do was just slow
the accumulation of this damage.
But really what this reprogramming
of the epigenome tells us
is that this is a lot
more kind of modifiable
and elastic than we originally knew.
So you can actually take
a cell that has aged
and is of a given type and
completely change its state
using just a few factors.
And so this really
opens up this whole idea
of things like cell engineering.
So how do we take cells
and move them to states
that we actually think more
functional and healthier?
And how do we figure
out what types of states
actually give rise to health and function
in our different organ systems?
And then once we know those states,
can we move different cells into them?
A lot of the changes that
cells undergo with aging,
including changes to the epigenome,
actually give rise to
some diseases like cancer.
So the risk of cancer
actually increases exponentially with age.
And we think some of this
might be due to the types
of changes that are measured
when we look at the epigenome.
So one hypothesis is if
you can actually remodel
or reprogram the epigenome
to a younger state,
that you actually might
prevent some of these cells
from developing into cancers.
Now that won't deal with
some of the mutations
that might proceed cancer,
but actually a lot of mutations accumulate
early in the lifespan.
And the question is, what
is happening with aging
that is still later on pushing these cells
to become cancerous?
The epigenetic clock has
been really remarkable
in that it can actually track
aging across a diverse array
of cell types and organ systems.
So you can use the same measure
to track aging in your skin
as you would use in your
liver or in your blood.
And more importantly,
what we find is actually
the difference between
the age you get predicted
based on the epigenetic clock
and your chronological age
holds biological meaning.
And the reason we think it
holds biological meaning
is because it actually seems
to be somewhat predictive
or indicative of
different kind of outcomes
or diseases in whichever
organ it was measured in.
So when I measure
epigenetic age in the blood,
what we find is that that
measure is actually predictive
of things like remaining life expectancy
or heart disease risk or diabetes.
We've actually looked at epigenetic age
measured in the brain, these
are people after they've died.
But what we find is that
that seems to be correlated
with the pathology associated
with things like Alzheimer's disease.
So we think even though we haven't proven
that this is causally
driving these diseases,
it does seem to be a signature
for the aging processes
that seem to give rise
to the diseases of aging.
As we continue to develop and improve
these epigenetic clock measures,
they'll actually be highly
useful for tracking things
like aging and actually
understanding things
like disease risk.
So the great thing is that
epigenetic clock measures
aren't just giving you a
whole-body aging measure,
but we can actually measure
it in different subsystems
and understand how people
might be differently aging
across different systems in their body.
So some people might be more
prone to metabolic aging,
other people might be more prone
to kind of inflammatory aging.
And that profile, when you
take it all into consideration,
might give you a better idea of, one,
the interventions or the lifestyle factors
that you should actually
implement in your life,
or two, the specific diseases
that you might be more
or less at risk for.
The reason why scientists are so excited
about the idea of intervening
in the aging process,
whether it be slowing the aging process
or reversing the aging process,
is because we actually
think that in doing so
we can stop all of the different changes
that are giving rise to the
diseases that we care about.
So rather than going after
one disease at a time
and having, you know, one type of science
aimed at trying to cure cancer
and another aimed at diabetes,
if we actually could
reverse or slow aging,
we could basically eliminate diseases
or at least postpone
diseases across the board.
Right now people are
using the epigenetic clock
as more of a diagnostic as
opposed to a means to intervene.
So people are using it as
potentially one indicator
of how they're aging overall.
It's not a perfect indicator,
and it's only capturing one
facet of the aging process,
but it can give people some indication
of their health status and
potentially their overall risk
of developing different diseases of aging.

(air whooshes)
- [Announcer] "Chapter 5: "How
nutrition enables longevity."
(air whooshes)
- Nutrition science is actually something
that people in the
longevity and aging field
have been very interested in.
And actually for hundreds of years,
people have been studying how our diets
and the amount of food
and types of food we eat
seem to impact our aging.
But the science is also really difficult
because, at least in humans,
it's hard to actually assign
people specific diets and
actually have them maintain those
for a long enough time to study them
in kind of this randomized
clinical trial way.
So usually what scientists
end up kind of leaning on
is what we call epidemiological
or observational data.
So they look at populations
and they compare the diets
that different people
eat, and then they look at
kind of the features of those people.
Using things like biological
aging or disease risk
or life expectancy, do certain
diets tend to correlate
with certain outcomes?
The problem with this is it's
really hard to say anything
about whether the diet is
actually causing those things,
and also people who tend
to have healthier diets
also have other health behaviors
that go along with them.
So figuring out exactly what
components of diet matter
is really difficult.
The main dietary component
that's actually been studied
in the aging and longevity field
is actually this idea
of caloric restriction.
So more than a hundred years
ago, researchers actually saw
that when they restrict
the amount of calories
that animals eat, they
tended to live longer.
And so this really sparked an entire field
of studying this concept
of caloric restriction.
Caloric restriction isn't starvation,
it's usually just about a 20% reduction
in the overall calorie intake.
And in a lot of different animal models,
so anything from a worm, fly, mouse,
people have seen that when
animals are caloric restricted,
they tend to live longer.
One caveat though is that this actually
may be different depending on genetics.
So there was a study in mice
that actually showed mice
with different genetic backgrounds.
Some of them benefited
from chloric restriction,
some of them had no effect,
and then actually some of them did worse.
So we actually think that the
amount of chloric restriction
our bodies can tolerate might
be genetically determined
and that actually this should be
a more personalized regimen.
When trying to figure out if something
like caloric restriction
is actually beneficial
to the aging process in
terms of slowing aging,
one caveat is that humans today
are actually not kind of at baseline.
We're actually more prone to overeating.
So some researchers have figured out
that it might not be
the caloric restriction
that's actually the beneficial thing
but the kind of tendency
away from overeating.
Even if you can't restrict your calories
in terms of what's actually been studied
in caloric restriction,
just moving away from over
consumption or overeating
and being more in line with
your actual caloric needs,
based on your energy out,
is probably gonna have a
beneficial effect for most people.
The discovery of caloric
restriction was on accident.
So the scientists
weren't actually going in
to try and study how diet was
affecting aging and longevity.
But they just happened
to find that when their,
in this case it was rats, were
eating a lower-calorie diet,
they tended to live longer.
And after that was first
discovered a few hundred years ago,
people continued to study this,
and it really became a big
deal in kind of the 1970s
and 1980s and moving even into today
where people have tried to
figure out what is the mechanism
by which reducing your calories
into this kind of minimal deficit
produces a kind of extension
in terms of life expectancy
and healthy disease-free life expectancy.
Diet is probably the behavior
that's been studied the most
in terms of trying to affect things
like aging and longevity.
So in animals it's shown to
have a quite marked effect
on life expectancy.
But it doesn't mean that
your diet has to be extreme.
So when we say it's
gonna have a big effect,
this might just mean
avoiding certain diets
like overconsumption or
eating a lot of things
that we actually already
know are bad for us
and just maintaining a
moderate diet that is in line
with our energy needs on a daily basis.
There are really three components of diet
that seem to be impacting aging.
So the first is how much we
eat, the second is what we eat,
and the third is perhaps when we eat.
So in terms of how much we eat,
a lot of science went into this
idea of caloric restriction,
but really, again, it's maintaining
even a slight deficit to no deficit.
So most of us aren't going to be able
to maintain a 20% calorie
deficit for our whole life.
But as long as we can meet
needs that are in line
with our energy expenditure
and we're not over-consuming,
we think that's gonna have a benefit
for overall aging in health.
The other thing that's been studied
is this concept of what we eat.
So a lot of research has
gone into whether things
like a plant-based diet
are actually beneficial
to aging longevity, and there
seems to be some evidence
that a moderately low
animal protein diets,
so eating less animal products,
more fruits and veggies,
more whole foods is
gonna be better overall.
Also minimizing things like refined sugars
and the things that we actually
know are bad for our health.
The third comes down to when we eat,
and this is really a new field
in kind of aging and longevity science.
So again, most people aren't gonna be able
to calorically restrict,
but what scientists found is
actually fasting can mimic
some of the benefits that we've seen
with caloric restriction.
So if people can fast for, you know,
a number of hours throughout the day,
so perhaps minimize their
eating to a small window,
we think that this can
actually recapitulate
a lot of the benefits that we're seeing
in the caloric restriction studies.
So there's still some debate
about when that window should occur.
So some of the scientists
actually pointing
to front loading your calories,
so eating earlier in the day
and trying to fast throughout the day.
But we're also not sure, for
a lot of people it's easier
to do the opposite and have just a dinner
and calorically restrict early.
So we're not sure actually
if that would have
the same benefit as doing it earlier.
The idea of why things like
caloric restriction or fasting
might actually improve our aging process
and increase our health
is because we think
this kind of evokes this idea
of hormesis in our bodies.
So what hormesis refers
to is a mild stressor
that actually makes our
bodies more resilient
and robust distress over time.
So having these short-term mild stressors,
whether it be fasting
or whether it be a small caloric deficit,
actually makes our bodies more robust
and we think more resilient against
a lot of the changes we see
that increase with aging.
So what we eat may also change
depending on who we are.
So we also know that our
genetics might determine
what we should be eating and how much,
but also our age might change
what we should be eating and how much.
So people who are older
and more prone to things
like muscle loss or
weakness might actually need
more protein than people who are younger,
where science has actually
shown that a low-protein diet
might be beneficial.
So it's important to keep in mind
that these things aren't set in stone
and really need to be considered
on a personalized basis.
It's not that easy to figure out
what the optimal or ideal
diet is for each of us.
We don't know exactly
how things like genetics
are going to predispose
people to different diets,
but one way to do this
is to actually keep track
of a lot of these health indices,
things like our biological age measures
to actually see how our
diet is affecting us.
So if you were to
completely change your diet
or introduce something
like intermittent fasting,
do you see that reflected
in your measures?
The other things are just
functionally how you're feeling.
So as people get older and, again,
might be more prone to
things like weakness
or muscle wasting, they
might actually want
to increase things like
protein in their diet
to make sure they're maintaining
some of these functions
that they might see declining with time.
As we move forward in the science
and actually develop more of
these biomarkers of aging,
I think this will really
start to accelerate
our understanding of how diet
impacts the aging process.
But for now, what we
can say is that probably
the best advice is to not eat too much
and try and maintain kind of
a whole foods organic diet
with not too much animal protein in it.
People have been really
consumed with the idea
of immortality and aging
for a very long time.
But the question is, is a
longer life truly a better life?
And in some cases, perhaps
yes, but not always.
So really what matters to most
people is quality of life.
So we all want to maintain
our health and our functions
and be able to enjoy the things
that actually make life worth living.
So really what aging science is about
is not just prolonging life at all cost,
but actually prolonging healthy life.
So can we delay the onset of disease?
Can we delay the onset
of functional decline
and keep people healthy and functioning
for as long as possible?
So we think if we actually intervene
in the aging process
itself, that we can delay
all of the things that actually
people are scared about
when they think of aging.
And that's really the goal.
We want to increase quality of life
and maintain that over time.
And if that produces a longer
life, that's an extra bonus.
But that's not the ultimate goal.
We know that there is
sometimes a disconnect
between this concept, what we
call lifespan and health span.
So lifespan, again, is just
the time you've been alive
between birth and death.
And what scientists think health span is
is the time you are alive
in a more healthy functioning state.
And that's really what
we're trying to optimize.
But sometimes we see a disconnect
or discordance between these two features.
So one example is actually this idea
of the health survival paradox that we see
between men and women.
So on average, women across the world
tend to live longer by
a few years than men.
But women are also more prone
to some of the diseases we see with aging.
So things like arthritis,
Alzheimer's disease.
And really on average, women
tend to spend more time
in some of this age-related
disability than men do.
And some might argue is that a better life
because they've lived longer?
Or would you actually
want maybe a shorter life
but more free from
these diseases of aging?
In thinking about how we
actually want to intervene
in aging and what we want to
be the outcome of our science,
this really comes down to this concept
that we call compression of morbidity.
So the idea is, can we
push the onset of disease
and disability as far away
so that right before you die,
you're really compressing
the timing of disease
into this really short window,
as opposed to kind of
having it earlier in life
and surviving 20, 30 or 40 years
with these diseases of aging?
And we think this is possible
'cause you can actually look
at centenarian populations
and see that they actually
tend to compress the timing of disease
into the short window right before death.
So they're spending the
majority of their life
in a much more healthy state.
And really what we want
to do is figure out
how can we have this possible for everyone
so that we can remain healthy, functioning
and happy with good quality of
life for as long as possible.
Another really important
thing to keep in mind,
in terms of longevity science,
is that we actually don't wanna increase
what we call health disparities.
So right now, even though the average
kind of life expectancy in the population
is just under about 80 years,
we wanna make sure that
we can get everyone
to a longer and healthier life
and not just have
interventions or therapeutics
that help richer or more
affluent people get there.
And really how do we
make sure that everyone
can have as healthy and
long a life as possible.
