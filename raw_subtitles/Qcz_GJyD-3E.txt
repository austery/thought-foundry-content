Hello
 everyone.
 Happy
 Saturday,
 February


the
 28th,
 2026.


This
 morning,
 after
 weeks
 of
 escalating


threats,
 the
 United
 States
 and
 Israel


bombed
 several
 parts
 of
 Iran,
 including


the
 Supreme
 Leader
 Ali
 Ham's
 compound
 in


Tehran.
 Iran
 responded
 in
 kind
 with


missiles
 launched
 towards
 Israel
 and


four
 Gulf
 Arab
 countries
 which
 host
 US


military
 bases
 Bahrain,
 Kuwait,
 Qatar


and
 the
 UAE.
 Now
 this
 is
 a
 fastmoving


situation
 which
 feels
 extraordinarily


tenuous.
 So
 we
 obviously
 turned


immediately
 to
 Eurasia
 Group's
 founder


Ian
 Bremer
 to
 help
 us
 make
 sense
 of
 what


is
 happening
 now
 and
 what
 is
 to
 come.


Ian,
 hi.


>> Helen,
 good
 to
 see
 you
 as
 always.


So
 Ian,
 as
 I
 mentioned,
 the
 threats
 have


been
 stacking
 up
 for
 weeks
 now.
 So
 this


escalation
 isn't
 exactly
 a
 surprise,
 but


tell
 us
 why
 Trump
 is
 doing
 this
 now.


Well,
 um
 there
 are a
 couple
 reasons.


First,
 there
 is
 a
 level
 of
 confidence


that
 Trump
 has
 uh
 both
 on
 the
 back
 of


his
 uh
 success
 in
 Venezuela,
 having
 uh


removed
 Nicholas
 Maduro,
 not


assassinated
 him,
 actually
 bringing
 him


to
 justice,
 though
 a
 lot
 of
 Venezuelans


and
 Cubans
 were
 killed
 in
 the
 operation.


No
 Americans
 were.
 It's
 gone
 over
 well.


Uh
 the
 Americans
 find
 it
 popular.
 Uh


most
 of
 the
 Latin
 American
 countries


find
 it
 popular.
 and
 you
 know
 he's
 like


well
 I
 can
 do
 this
 in
 other
 places
 too.


Uh
 so
 part
 of
 it
 is
 that
 part
 part
 of
 it


is
 that
 he's
 had
 experience
 with
 Iran


before
 military
 experience.
 Uh
 after


withdrawing
 from
 the
 Iranian
 nuclear


deal,
 the
 JCPOA
 in
 his
 first
 term
 he's


put
 the
 Iranians
 on
 notice
 on
 a
 couple


of
 occasions.
 And
 when
 he
 has
 engaged
 in


military
 strikes
 against
 Iran,
 the


Iranians
 have
 not
 been
 able
 or
 willing


to
 hit
 him
 back.
 uh
 and
 so
 he
 he
 doesn't


feel
 like
 there's
 a
 deterrent
 capability


here.
 So
 he's
 not
 taking
 a
 particularly


big
 risk.
 Um
 finally
 uh
 he
 did
 engage
 in


negotiations
 but
 his
 demands
 were
 much


greater
 than
 the
 Iranians
 were
 willing


to
 engage
 and
 that's
 been
 clear
 for


months
 now
 frankly.
 uh
 but
 he
 did
 want


to
 ensure
 that
 there
 was
 adequate


military
 capabilities
 in
 the
 region
 uh


both
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 strikes
 that
 the


Americans
 were
 going
 to
 engage
 in
 that


we're
 now
 seeing
 the
 beginning
 of
 but


also
 in
 terms
 of
 America's
 ability
 to


help
 defend
 Israel
 and
 its
 own
 bases
 and


its
 allies
 across
 the
 region.
 um
 that


final
 the
 final
 components
 of
 that
 uh


only
 got
 into
 place
 days
 ago
 and
 then


this
 was
 the
 first
 window
 of
 opportunity


um
 after
 that
 when
 the
 uh
 Americans
 and


Israelis
 had
 a
 clean
 shot
 at
 the
 supreme


leader
 and
 the
 top
 military
 leadership


um
 and
 they
 gave
 the
 order.
 So
 that's


that's
 you
 know
 what
 precipitated


all
 of
 this.
 There's
 a
 broader
 question


about,
 you
 know,
 how
 do
 we
 feel
 about


the
 United
 States
 exercising
 unilateral


military
 power
 all
 over
 the
 world?
 Um,


engaging
 in
 a
 policy
 of
 regime
 change,


assassinating
 political
 leaders.
 What


does
 that
 mean
 going
 forward
 for
 the
 US?


What
 does
 it
 mean
 for
 other
 countries


around
 the
 world?
 But,
 but
 in
 terms
 of


what
 what
 led
 to
 this
 series
 of
 strikes,


um,
 this
 did
 not
 certainly
 did
 not


surprise
 us.
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 was
 a
 big


surprise
 to
 the
 markets.
 The
 scale
 of


the
 military
 strikes
 were
 greater
 than


were
 generally
 anticipated,
 but
 nobody


nobody
 credible
 following
 this
 believed


that
 the
 negotiations
 were
 heading
 for


breakthrough.
 Nor
 did
 they
 believe
 that


this
 was
 a
 taco
 moment
 that
 Trump
 was


going
 to
 chicken
 out.
 uh
 they
 they
 did


feel
 and
 we
 did
 feel
 um
 that
 he
 was


going
 to
 make
 good
 as
 it
 were
 on
 his


threats
 as
 were
 the
 Israelis
 and
 they've


been
 coordinating
 on
 this
 very
 closely


for
 a
 couple
 of
 months
 now.


>> So
 as
 you
 know
 Trump
 just
 announced
 um
 a


few
 minutes
 ago
 on
 Truth
 Social
 that
 Kam


is
 dead.
 Is
 like
 what
 happens
 now?
 That


feels
 huge.


>> I
 I
 think
 it
 is
 a
 big
 deal.
 Um
 and
 I


mean
 there
 are
 a
 few
 things
 to
 say
 about


it.
 The
 first
 is
 that
 let
 us
 remember


that
 this
 is
 an
 incredibly
 brutal
 regime


and
 that
 Hamei
 has
 uh
 not
 only
 been


personally
 responsible
 uh
 for
 the


brutality
 of
 the
 regime
 but
 also
 has


been
 a
 hardliner
 in
 terms
 of
 refusing


effective
 negotiations
 with
 the


Americans
 uh
 over
 the
 past
 months.
 Um,
 I


mean
 certainly
 many
 thousands
 of
 Iranian


civilians
 and
 and
 believed
 tens
 of


thousands
 of
 Iranian
 civilians
 were


killed
 uh
 under
 the
 order
 of
 Hamei


um
 in
 January
 when
 they
 were


demonstrating
 and
 most
 of
 these
 were


unarmed
 and
 not
 posing
 a
 direct
 security


threat
 um
 to
 the
 troops
 that
 they
 were


facing
 off
 against
 and
 that
 is
 frankly


we
 haven't
 seen
 that
 kind
 of
 short-term


brutality


um
 in
 the
 region
 uh
 anywhere.
 Uh
 you'd


have
 to
 look
 to
 Sudan,
 you'd
 have
 to


look
 to
 Rwanda
 before
 you
 saw
 that
 kind


of
 killing.
 You're
 talking
 about
 the


sort
 of
 deaths
 over
 the
 course
 of
 a


couple
 weeks
 that
 you
 saw
 in
 Gaza
 over


an
 entire
 year
 of
 fighting.
 So
 that's


that's
 really
 an
 extraordinary
 um


brutality
 and
 and
 as
 a
 consequence,


there
 aren't
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 are


going
 to
 um
 shed
 a
 tear
 over
 the
 death


of
 Hamei.
 Um,
 having
 said
 that,
 um,
 he


is
 not
 the
 regime.
 He's
 86
 years
 old.


They've
 been
 planning
 for
 transition
 for


a
 long
 time.
 The
 fact
 that
 he
 has
 been


killed
 will
 make
 him
 seem
 to
 be
 more
 of


a
 martyr
 in
 the
 eyes
 certainly
 of
 those


that
 support
 the
 regime
 inside
 Iran,
 of


whom
 there
 are
 many
 uh
 a
 minimum
 of


probably
 15
 and
 20%
 of
 the
 population


that
 are
 hardened
 regime
 supporters
 and


will
 become
 more
 so
 on
 the
 back
 of
 this


assassination.
 Um
 the
 uh
 Iranian
 uh


military
 leadership
 has
 taken


substantial
 strikes.
 um
 over
 the
 12-day


war
 last
 year
 and
 they
 reconstituted


themselves
 quite
 quickly.
 It
 didn't


affect
 their
 ability
 and
 willingness
 to


repress
 internally.
 It
 it
 does
 appear


that
 a
 number
 of
 other
 military
 leaders


may
 well
 be
 dead.
 Um
 probably
 not
 the


president
 um
 but
 others.
 The
 president's


not
 a
 very
 important
 figure,
 frankly,
 in


the
 eyes
 of
 the
 Iranian
 people
 or
 in


driving
 power,
 but
 the
 head
 of
 the
 IRGC


may
 well
 be
 dead.
 Uh
 the
 Islamic


Revolutionary
 Guard
 Corps,
 the
 Israelis


have
 announced
 that
 he
 has
 been
 killed


as
 well
 as
 other
 top
 adviserss
 uh
 to
 the


Supreme
 Leader
 on
 the
 military
 side.
 But


it's
 it's
 very
 far
 to
 go
 from
 that
 to


it's
 the
 end
 of
 the
 regime.
 Because


remember
 when
 Trump
 launched
 these


strikes
 with
 the
 Israelis,
 he
 said,


"We're
 attacking
 all
 of
 the
 military


installations."
 And
 they've
 certainly


done
 that.
 They're
 attacking
 all
 the


ballistic
 missile
 installations
 that


they
 can
 find
 that
 that
 they
 can
 get
 to.


They're
 certainly
 doing
 that.
 Um
 but
 he


also
 said
 this
 is
 meant
 to
 be
 an


operation
 of
 regime
 change.
 She
 said,


"Now
 that
 we're
 taking
 out
 the


leadership,
 it
 is
 your
 once
 in
 a


generation
 opportunity,
 the
 Iranian


people,
 to
 take
 your
 government.
 But


taking
 the
 government
 requires


overthrowing


those
 members
 of
 the
 IRGC,
 the
 military,


the
 bases,
 the
 paramilitary
 groups,
 um


the
 the
 police
 officers
 on
 the
 streets,


um
 and
 others
 that
 have
 been
 very


willing
 and
 capable
 of
 using
 lethal


force
 against
 the
 Iranian
 civilians.
 And


there's
 no
 reason
 to
 believe
 that
 that's


about
 to
 change.
 It
 it
 might.
 We
 can


hope
 that
 it's
 about
 to
 change,
 but


there's
 no
 reason
 yet.
 There's
 no


evidence
 that
 makes
 us
 believe
 that.
 And


there's
 certainly
 no
 American
 boots
 on


the
 ground.
 Uh
 there
 are
 no
 Israeli


boots
 on
 the
 ground.
 There's
 there's
 no


coordinated
 opposition
 with
 leadership


the
 way
 there
 has
 been
 in
 Venezuela,
 for


example.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 on
 the
 one
 hand,
 in


Venezuela,
 Trump
 was
 fully
 prepared
 to


continue
 to
 work
 with
 the
 same
 regime,


having
 removed
 Maduro,
 and
 that
 has
 so


far
 proven
 to
 be
 a
 pretty
 effective


short-term
 strategy
 at
 least.
 But
 in


Iran,
 Trump
 isn't
 prepared
 to
 work
 with


the
 existing
 regime,
 understandably
 in


many
 ways.
 But
 it's
 not
 clear
 how
 we
 get


from
 that
 to
 the
 government
 of
 the


people,
 which
 would
 be
 an
 extraordinary


thing
 for
 Iran
 and
 for
 the
 entire
 region


and
 for
 the
 world.
 Uh
 but
 but
 some


someone's
 got
 to
 actually
 make
 that


happen.
 And
 for
 now,
 as
 of
 today,
 it


would
 be
 it'd
 be
 quite
 a
 stretch
 to
 say


that
 the
 Iranian
 people
 have
 the


capacity
 to
 do
 that.


So
 Raza
 Palavi
 who
 is
 of
 course
 the
 son


of
 the
 of
 the
 sha
 has
 said
 that
 he's


willing
 to
 come
 back
 from
 exile.
 How


realistic
 do
 you
 think
 that
 is?
 I
 mean


with
 sufficient
 support
 um
 I
 mean


policing
 around
 him
 um
 it
 is
 perhaps


plausible
 um
 that
 he
 could
 be
 there
 and


he
 could
 set
 up
 camp
 someplace.
 Um
 I


think
 it's
 plausible.
 It's
 not
 today
 but


it's
 perhaps
 plausible.
 But
 that


requires
 some
 level
 of
 intervention,


right?
 I
 mean,
 it's
 not
 as
 if
 you're


able
 to
 right
 now
 um
 fly
 in
 friendlies


um
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 welcomed
 at


the
 Tran
 International
 Airport.
 Like


that
 that's
 not
 a
 thing.
 Um
 and
 and


again,
 I
 mean,
 Trump
 has
 been
 very


careful.
 Everyone
 is
 talking
 about
 how


Trump
 is
 a
 hawk
 and
 Trump
 is
 a
 hardliner


and
 he's
 willing
 to
 use
 military
 force.


And
 clearly
 there
 are
 lots
 of
 countries


that
 have
 been
 on
 the
 wrong
 side
 of
 uh


American
 bombs
 and
 missiles
 over
 the


last
 year
 just
 as
 they
 have
 in
 the
 Biden


administration
 as
 they
 have
 in
 the
 in
 in


previous
 administrations.
 But
 but
 Trump


does
 not
 want
 American
 troops
 getting


killed.
 He
 doesn't
 want
 forever
 wars.


remember
 he
 brought
 the
 war
 in


Afghanistan
 after
 some
 20
 years
 to
 an


end.
 Biden
 concluded
 it.
 Um
 but
 it
 was


Trump
 that
 that
 took
 a
 deal
 with
 the


Taliban
 that
 in
 many
 ways
 was
 one-sided


because
 he
 just
 wanted
 the
 American


troops
 out.
 And
 so
 Trump
 is
 going
 to


continue
 to
 be
 extremely
 reluctant
 to


commit
 any
 American
 forces
 on
 the


ground.
 Um,
 and
 absent
 that,
 uh,
 we
 are


pretty
 far,
 at least
 again,
 as
 of
 today,


from
 a
 place
 that
 you
 would
 say,
 I


predict
 that
 this
 regime
 is
 over
 and
 the


sha
 can
 come
 back
 and
 uh,
 the
 Iranians


can
 have
 democratic
 elections
 and
 they


can
 actually
 put
 in
 place
 a
 regime
 that


would
 represent
 them.
 We're
 we're
 very


far
 from
 that.
 Now,
 there's
 still
 going


to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 military
 attacks,
 and
 the


Americans
 uh
 expect
 this
 to
 go
 on


probably
 for
 a
 matter
 of
 several
 days
 to


a
 little
 over
 a
 week
 in
 terms
 of


destroying
 all
 of
 Iran's
 naval


capabilities,


um
 extinguishing
 uh
 their
 UAV,
 um
 the


unarmed
 aerial
 vehicles,
 and
 and
 their


missile
 uh
 capabilities.
 it
 is
 possible


that
 they've
 already
 fired
 off
 a
 lot
 of


what
 they
 still
 have.
 Uh
 but
 but
 if
 they


haven't
 uh
 within
 a
 week
 that
 that


capacity
 will
 be
 done.
 Um
 and
 so
 you


know
 I
 I
 think
 it
 is
 it
 is
 plausible


that
 um
 in
 very
 short
 order
 Iran
 will
 no


longer
 have
 direct
 capacity
 to
 threaten


other
 regimes
 in
 the
 region.
 Um
 they
 may


have
 asymmetric
 capabilities
 through


proxies.
 They
 could
 certainly
 fund


terrorist
 activities,
 that
 sort
 of


thing.
 They
 could
 engage
 in
 espionage,


but
 but
 conventional
 military


activities,
 we
 are
 nearing
 the
 end
 of


Iran's
 capacity
 to
 project
 power.
 And


that's
 a
 big
 deal.
 But
 that's
 very
 very


different,
 Helen,
 from
 saying
 that
 Iran


won't
 have
 the
 capacity
 to
 repress
 their


people
 on
 the
 ground.
 That
 that
 is
 not


something
 that
 the
 Americans
 right
 now


have
 a
 military
 plan
 for.
 Um
 and
 and
 it


is
 right
 now
 there's
 no
 reason
 to


believe
 there's
 no
 evidence
 that
 would


show
 that
 the
 Iranian
 regime
 is
 going
 to


be
 incapable
 of
 continuing
 to
 repress


absent
 such
 a
 play.


>> I
 have
 so
 many
 follow-up
 questions
 to


that,
 but
 one
 I
 guess
 is
 who
 do
 you
 see


emerging
 then
 as
 a
 leader
 or
 is
 it
 just


too
 early
 to
 say
 given
 the
 chaos
 that
 is


happening
 on
 the
 ground
 in
 Iran?
 And
 I


guess
 the
 other
 question
 is
 what's
 the


plan
 for
 tomorrow
 or
 what's
 the
 plan
 for


after
 the
 strikes
 stop
 for
 the
 Iranian


people?
 Like
 what
 is
 does
 is
 Trump
 does


Trump
 care
 about
 that
 or
 like
 it
 just


seems
 like
 this
 is
 all
 happening
 and


there
 is
 actually
 no
 plan
 for
 for
 for


the
 people
 on
 the
 ground
 which


>> so
 two
 different
 questions.
 Uh
 as
 of


right
 now
 your
 expectation
 would
 be
 that


the
 IRGC
 will
 still
 be
 in
 charge.
 Uh
 a


number
 of
 their
 top
 leaders
 will
 be


killed.
 there
 will
 be
 new
 leaders
 that


will
 come
 and
 replace
 them.
 We
 have
 seen


that
 with
 Hezbollah
 with
 complete


decapitation
 uh
 by
 Israel
 over
 the
 last


year,
 the
 pager
 attacks
 and
 all
 of
 that


and
 they
 have
 refilled
 their
 ranks,


right?
 Um
 and
 they
 are
 nowhere
 near
 as


capable
 as
 they
 used
 to
 be.
 They
 don't


pose
 a
 significant
 threat
 to
 Israel


today.
 Uh
 but
 they
 still
 have
 a
 lot
 of


capacity
 to
 govern
 on
 the
 ground
 in


southern
 Lebanon.
 and
 the
 Lebanese


government
 and
 army
 has
 been
 incapable


slash
 unwilling
 to
 disarm
 them,
 which
 is


why
 the
 ceasefire
 um
 is
 has
 been
 uh
 hard


to
 maintain.
 Um
 so
 that
 that's
 what
 you


would
 expect
 to
 see
 right
 now.
 Um
 now


that
 recognizes
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 be


very
 hard
 for
 them
 to
 communicate
 with


each
 other
 for
 the
 near
 term.
 it
 might


be
 hard
 for
 them
 to
 actually
 have
 orders


that
 are
 given
 in
 a
 centralized
 way
 that


are
 then
 followed
 out
 across
 the


country,
 but
 still
 for
 now
 that's
 what


we're
 looking
 at
 and
 that's
 kind
 of
 the


way
 the
 country
 has
 been
 run
 um
 for
 the


past
 years.
 Um
 so
 this
 is
 not
 this
 is


not
 a
 regime
 that
 is
 new
 to
 figuring
 out


how
 to
 effectively
 uh
 repress
 its
 people


domestically.
 Um
 and
 and
 so


>> do
 you
 see
 and
 do
 and
 sorry
 to
 interrupt


you
 but
 do
 you
 see
 so
 given
 that
 state


so
 you
 don't
 see
 the
 IRGC
 actually
 kind


of
 falling
 apart
 you
 think
 that
 that


will
 kind
 of
 m
 they'll
 maintain
 their


their
 power
 they're
 not
 organized


obviously
 there's
 a
 total
 disarray


happening
 in
 the
 country
 but
 the
 IRGC


will
 actually
 stick
 together
 as
 a
 unit


and
 will
 continue
 to
 run
 the
 country
 is


it
 too
 early
 to
 imagine
 that
 you
 might


see
 kind
 of
 democratic
 leaders
 emerging


from
 within
 the
 like
 the
 organ


organization
 on
 the
 ground
 in
 Iran.
 I


know
 that
 the
 many
 leaders
 has
 been
 put


into
 prison.
 Do
 you
 think
 they
 would
 get


out?
 Like
 what
 do
 you
 think
 it
 all
 of


this
 is
 too
 soon?
 I
 hope
 I
 am
 wrong.
 It


is
 too
 early
 for
 me
 to
 be
 saying
 the


IRGC
 is
 going
 to
 be
 in
 charge
 of
 this


country
 in
 three
 months
 time.
 It
 is
 too


early
 to
 say
 that.
 I
 am
 responding
 to


your
 question
 saying
 right
 now,
 who
 do
 I


expect
 is
 in
 charge?
 That's
 right
 now.


That
 is
 less
 than
 24
 hours
 after
 these


strikes
 have
 begun.
 It
 is
 still
 the


IRGC.
 There
 are
 many
 things
 that
 could


change
 over
 time.
 Um,
 and
 there's
 very


little
 information
 on
 the
 ground.
 But


the
 key
 point
 here
 is
 that
 unlike
 in


Venezuela
 where
 the
 Americans
 had
 active


ongoing
 engagement
 with
 senior
 leaders


that
 they
 were
 prepared
 to
 work
 with


after
 taking
 Maduro
 out.
 They
 do
 not


have
 that
 in
 Iran.
 They
 have
 tried.
 They


have
 gotten
 some
 support
 from
 some
 IRGC


members
 who
 have
 given
 them
 information


and
 intelligence
 on
 the
 whereabouts
 of


the
 supreme
 leader
 and
 other
 senior


leaders
 in
 Iran
 that
 has
 been
 helpful
 in


in
 getting
 them
 the
 success
 that
 they


have
 just
 seen
 um
 in
 these
 strikes.
 So,


it's
 not
 like
 they
 haven't
 engaged
 in


intelligence
 collection,
 but
 what
 they


don't
 have
 is
 a
 group
 inside
 the


government
 that
 they're
 prepared
 to
 work


with.
 And
 and
 the
 opposition
 at
 this


point
 is
 very
 fragmented.
 Um,
 doesn't


really
 exist
 on
 the
 ground
 in
 an


organized
 way
 at
 all,
 even
 though
 most


people
 oppose
 the
 regime.
 So,
 then
 your


other
 question,
 what
 does
 Trump
 do?
 You


know,
 what
 does
 this
 mean?
 Well,
 Trump


has
 a
 series
 of
 goals
 and
 and
 think


about
 the
 way
 he's
 presented
 them


because
 he
 wants
 this
 to
 be
 a
 big
 win.


Um,
 one
 goal
 is
 the
 destruction
 of


Iran's
 nuclear
 capabilities.
 He
 did
 a


fair
 amount
 of
 that
 last
 year.
 He
 said


they
 were
 obliterated.
 Some
 of
 them


were,
 but
 not
 all
 of
 them.
 and
 they


rebuilt
 as
 quickly
 as
 they
 could
 without


oversight
 from
 the
 International
 Atomic


Energy
 Agency
 inspectors.
 Um,
 so
 there's


that.
 Um,
 the
 ballistic
 missiles
 the


Iranians
 were
 refused
 to
 even
 negotiate


on,
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 have
 now
 been
 blown


up
 and
 those
 that
 haven't,
 a
 lot
 of
 been


a
 lot
 of
 them
 have
 been
 launched
 um


against
 Israel
 but
 also
 against
 Gulf


States.
 And
 yes,
 they
 do
 host
 American


military
 bases,
 but
 most
 of
 the
 strikes


that
 we've
 seen
 so
 far
 have
 actually


been
 against
 civilian
 targets
 in
 those


countries
 like
 in
 Dubai,
 like
 in
 Riad,


which
 does
 not
 actually
 host
 any


American
 bases
 itself.
 Those
 bases
 are


far
 outside.
 Um
 and
 and
 so
 the
 ballistic


missiles
 are
 no
 longer
 the
 threat
 that


they
 used
 to
 be.
 So,
 you
 already
 have


two
 of
 the
 three
 goals
 that
 Trump


announced


um
 in
 his
 uh
 decision
 to
 go
 ahead
 uh


with
 a
 war
 against
 Iran
 that
 Trump
 can


say,
 "I've
 already
 achieved
 and
 I
 will


have
 achieved
 by
 the
 time
 these
 military


operations
 have
 concluded,
 I
 will
 have


achieved
 those
 goals."
 Now,
 the
 third


goal,
 which
 is
 regime
 change,
 he's
 given


himself
 an
 out.
 He
 said,
 'Okay,
 I've


I've
 done
 all
 of
 these
 strikes
 and
 right


now
 it's
 too
 dangerous
 because
 I'm
 still


going
 to
 hit
 and
 Israel
 is
 still
 going


to
 hit
 all
 these
 military
 and
 leadership


targets,
 but
 once
 we're
 done,
 Iranian


people
 take
 it
 over.
 And
 if
 they
 don't,


then
 he'll
 say,
 "Well,
 I
 I
 did


everything
 I
 could.
 I
 gave
 them
 the


opportunity.
 They
 didn't
 do
 it."
 Does
 is


does
 he
 want
 to
 say
 that?
 He
 doesn't


want
 to
 say
 that
 but
 but
 he's
 not
 going


to
 take
 responsibility
 for
 this
 himself


because
 he
 is
 not
 intending
 to
 engage
 in


the
 direct
 regime
 change
 himself.
 He
 has


already
 said
 in
 the
 initial
 hours
 of


these
 operations
 that
 the
 the
 actors


that
 will
 engage
 in
 changing
 the
 regime


will
 be
 the
 Iranian
 people.
 He
 has
 no


control
 over
 the
 Iranian
 people.
 He
 has


no
 influence
 over
 the
 Iranian
 people.
 A


lot
 of
 the
 Iranian
 people
 don't


particularly
 trust
 him.
 He
 said
 he
 was


going
 to
 rescue
 the
 Iranian
 people
 and


tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 Iranians
 died
 after


he
 said
 that
 he
 was
 going
 to
 rescue
 them


and
 and
 it
 was,
 you
 know,
 over
 a
 month


later
 before
 he
 took
 military
 action.


So,
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 that
 if
 you're
 an


Iranian
 citizen
 today,
 you
 know,
 you're


you're
 feeling
 pretty
 squeezed.
 You're


not
 necessarily
 feeling
 like
 there
 are


great
 opportunities
 in
 front
 of
 you
 in


any
 circumstance,
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 be


very
 dangerous
 what
 you
 decide
 to
 do.


going
 forward.
 Again,
 my
 my
 hope
 is
 that


this
 regime
 collapses
 with
 a
 minimum
 of


violence.
 I
 think
 that's
 everyone's


hope.
 It's
 everyone's
 hope.
 Whether
 you


supported
 the
 US
 attacks
 or
 you
 didn't,


everyone
 hopes
 that
 the
 Iranian
 people


can
 have
 a
 government
 that
 actually


respects
 and
 reflects
 their
 values,


their
 rights,
 um
 their
 their
 their
 hopes


and
 aspirations.
 But
 we
 are
 very
 far


from
 that.
 And
 the
 United
 States
 may


have
 facilitated
 that
 to
 a
 degree,
 but


they
 certainly
 are
 not
 causing
 it.
 Um,


and
 and
 again,
 we're
 very
 far
 from
 here


to
 there,


>> right?
 There
 is
 a
 very
 long
 way
 to
 go.
 I


am
 curious,
 and
 this
 is
 probably
 a


really
 stupid
 question,
 so
 you're


welcome.
 But
 why
 did
 Iran
 why
 have
 they


bombed
 Dubai,
 Riyad?
 Like
 why
 why
 are


they
 why
 are
 they
 bombing
 other
 Arab


states
 especially
 without
 the
 kind
 of


the
 the
 US
 base?
 Like
 I
 get
 that,
 but


I'm
 hearing
 about
 the
 Dubai
 airport


being
 hit.
 Like
 what's
 why
 would
 they


>> just
 now
 the
 Dubai
 airport
 looks
 like
 it


was
 hit?
 And
 I
 mean
 clearly
 and
 some
 of


the
 I'm
 not
 surprised
 that
 they
 sent


missiles
 and
 drones
 into
 the
 Gulf


States,
 but
 I
 would
 have
 expected
 as
 we


saw
 after
 the
 12-day
 war
 um
 that
 the


attacks
 would
 have
 been
 against
 um


American
 bases
 there
 as
 we
 saw
 in
 Qatar.


Um,
 and
 you
 know,
 maybe
 they
 fail,
 uh,


maybe
 they
 get
 knocked
 down,
 maybe
 in


the
 process
 of
 getting
 knocked
 down,


those
 Iranian
 weapons
 or
 the
 air


defense,
 the
 missile
 defense
 ends
 up


hitting
 other
 targets.
 That
 can


certainly
 happen,
 but
 that's
 not
 what


we're
 seeing.
 We're
 already
 seeing
 um,


drones
 that
 are
 directly
 targeting


civilian
 areas
 in
 Dubai,
 in
 Kuwait,
 in


Saudi
 Arabia.
 That
 that
 I
 have
 to
 tell


you
 that
 we've
 not
 seen
 that
 before
 from


Iran.
 So
 why
 would
 they
 do
 that?
 Well,
 I


mean,
 on
 the
 one
 hand,
 these
 countries


are
 seen
 by
 Iran
 as
 belligerent.
 They


are
 in
 principle
 neutral.
 They've
 not


joined
 the
 fight
 with
 the
 United
 States


and
 Israel,
 but
 they
 didn't
 prevent
 it.


Over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks,
 they


increasingly
 went
 from
 opposing
 it
 to


quietly
 saying
 that
 they
 would
 provide


support
 for
 the
 United
 States
 and
 Israel


um
 in
 in
 helping
 facilitate
 strikes.
 So,


I
 mean,
 Iran
 now,
 I
 think,
 accurately


sees
 them
 as
 hostile
 uh
 to
 to
 Iran's
 uh


survival.
 I
 I
 think
 Iran,
 if
 you
 are
 a


leader
 in
 Iran
 today,
 you
 recognize
 that


you
 may
 not
 belong
 for
 this
 world.
 There


is
 an
 active
 attempt
 to
 assassinate


every
 decision
 maker,
 active
 top
 level


decision
 maker
 that
 is
 still
 alive
 in


Iran
 today,
 which
 is
 a
 staggering
 thing


to
 say.
 And
 so
 um
 they
 may
 not
 be
 acting


quite
 as
 rationally.
 They
 may
 not
 be


thinking
 quite
 as
 long
 term
 and
 they


also
 can't
 communicate
 very
 well.
 So


this
 to
 me
 feels
 like
 desperation.
 If


you
 know
 that
 anything
 you
 do
 against


hardened
 facilities
 like
 bases
 or
 like


critical
 energy
 infrastructure
 is
 likely


to
 be
 shot
 down.
 and
 you
 want
 to
 show


that
 you
 can
 do
 something,
 that
 you're


not
 going
 to
 just
 sit
 and
 take
 it,
 that


there
 will
 be
 costs
 and
 consequences.


That
 that
 is,
 you
 know,
 perhaps
 the


logic
 that
 leads
 you
 to
 engage
 in
 those


strikes
 against
 civilian
 targets
 um


among
 countries
 that
 are
 presently


non-combatants.
 That
 that's
 the
 only


logic
 I
 can
 come
 up
 with.
 I
 don't


believe
 these
 are
 rogue
 actions
 by
 uh


missile
 and
 operators
 and
 drone


operators
 in
 Iran
 that
 are
 not
 getting


orders
 from
 anyone.
 I
 I
 don't
 believe


that.
 I
 think
 there's
 still
 sufficient


centralized
 control.


>> All
 right,
 let's
 talk
 about
 the
 response


from
 around
 the
 world.
 So
 I
 tell
 us


about
 tell
 us
 about
 your
 dealings
 with


the
 Europeans
 on
 this.
 I
 I
 saw
 I
 saw


some
 pretty
 funny
 interactions
 that
 you


had
 had.
 The
 Europeans
 are
 talking
 about


convening
 on
 Monday.
 Today
 is
 Saturday.


This
 does
 feel
 like
 something
 that
 maybe


would
 bring,
 you
 know,
 bring
 bring
 come


to
 the
 top
 of
 your
 attention,
 but
 what


are
 the
 Europeans
 doing?


>> They're
 basically
 acting
 concerned.
 Um,


you
 know,
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 they'll


write
 a
 strong
 letter.
 They're
 not


really
 relevant
 here.
 And
 that
 that


doesn't
 mean
 they're
 not
 relevant
 on


anything.
 I
 mean,
 we
 saw
 that
 when
 Trump


threatened
 them
 on
 Greenland,
 they
 they


said
 that
 they
 were
 going
 to
 hit
 back


with
 reciprocal
 tariffs
 and
 they
 were


going
 to
 hit
 back
 um
 with
 the


anti-coercion
 instrument
 and
 Trump


backed
 down.
 He
 backed
 down
 without


getting
 anything.
 So,
 it's
 not
 as
 if
 the


Europeans
 are
 uniquely
 factless
 on


everything.
 But
 on
 this
 issue,
 Trump


made
 his
 decision
 and
 he
 wasn't
 taking


any
 advice
 from
 the
 Europeans.
 um
 he
 was


not
 asking
 them
 to
 join.
 They
 are


functionally
 irrelevant
 to
 American


military
 decisionmaking


visa
 vis
 and
 that
 is
 an
 uncomfortable


position
 for
 the
 Europeans
 to
 be
 in.
 And


so
 if
 you're
 Ursula
 Vandonderline
 and


you
 say
 you're
 going
 to
 convene
 a


council
 to
 discuss
 it
 on
 Monday,
 you're


going
 to
 have
 probably
 just
 about
 as


much
 effect
 on
 Monday
 as
 you
 did
 on


Saturday.
 Now
 I
 I
 would
 have
 I
 would


have
 displayed
 more
 urgency.
 Um
 the


Brits
 did
 a
 bit
 of
 that
 and
 saying,
 you


know,
 that
 we
 got,
 you
 know,
 planes
 in


the
 air
 and
 we
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that


we're
 part
 of
 a
 collective
 defense,
 you


know,
 of
 our
 allies
 in
 the
 region.
 So


there
 could
 have
 been
 that,
 they
 could


have
 done
 that.
 That
 would
 have
 been
 an


important
 thing
 to
 do.
 Um
 secondarily,


there
 are
 lots
 of
 European
 citizens
 um


on
 the
 ground
 and
 so
 they
 obviously
 want


to
 make
 sure
 that
 they
 are,
 you
 know,


taking
 care,
 they're
 all
 secure,
 that


they're,
 you
 know,
 evacuating
 as
 best
 as


they
 possibly
 can.
 um
 you
 know
 all
 all


of
 these
 sorts
 of
 things,
 but
 they
 don't


really
 have
 a
 collective
 position
 on


Iran.
 They
 don't
 have
 anything
 that
 they


can
 functionally
 do
 um
 to
 um
 to
 change


the
 trajectory
 of
 this
 conflict.
 And


unlike
 in
 Iraq,
 unlike
 in
 Afghanistan,


they're
 not
 actually
 playing
 a
 role.


There
 is
 no
 coalition
 of
 the
 willing


here.
 So
 the
 Europeans
 are
 irrelevant
 to


this
 outcome.
 and
 and
 more
 broadly
 um


there
 is
 the
 reality
 that
 um
 the
 Chinese


are
 irrelevant
 to
 this
 outcome.
 The


Russians,
 Iran
 has
 no
 friends


externally.
 You
 know,
 we've
 seen
 since


October
 7th
 that
 Israel
 and
 the
 United


States
 have
 been
 able
 to
 target
 whether


it's
 the
 Houthis
 in
 Yemen
 or
 whether


it's
 Hezbollah
 or
 whether
 it's
 Iran
 last


year
 or
 just
 now
 or
 whether
 it's
 Hamas


in
 Gaza.
 In
 all
 of
 these
 cases,
 the


Israelis
 and
 the
 Americans
 on
 occasion


have
 engaged
 in
 military
 strikes,
 and


there's
 been
 really
 no
 effective


response
 whatsoever,
 either
 by
 Iran
 and


its
 proxies,
 the
 so-called
 axis
 of


resistance,
 um,
 or
 their
 friends
 and


supporters
 around
 the
 world,
 whether


it's
 global
 south
 countries
 that
 really


oppose
 the
 United
 States
 or
 it's
 the


Russians
 who
 have
 been
 working
 with
 Iran


closely
 to
 get
 more
 support
 for
 drones


to
 help
 them
 fight
 against
 Ukraine
 and


the
 war
 that
 they
 started
 four
 years


ago,
 the
 Russians,
 or
 whether
 it's
 China


that
 buys
 a
 lot
 of
 oil
 um
 from
 Iran.
 Um


I
 mean,
 they've
 all
 expressed
 criticism.


It
 is
 uh
 you
 know
 we've
 got
 right
 now


we've
 got
 a
 security
 as
 you
 and
 I
 are


talking
 there
 is
 a
 security
 council


emergency
 session
 that
 is
 going
 on
 and
 I


am
 quite
 certain
 that
 the
 Chinese
 and


Russians
 are
 expressing
 uh
 their
 uh


disagreement


uh
 with
 what
 has
 been
 ordered
 by
 the
 US


and
 by
 Israel
 but
 they're
 not
 prepared


to
 do
 anything.
 In
 fact,
 I
 don't
 even


believe
 that
 the
 Chinese
 will
 postpone


the
 upcoming
 um
 summit
 meeting
 of


President
 Trump
 to
 visit
 Beijing
 in


April
 on
 the
 back
 of
 these
 strikes.


There's
 really
 virtually
 nothing
 that


anyone
 is
 doing
 as
 a
 consequence
 of
 the


Americans
 and
 the
 Israelis
 establishing


military
 dominance
 against
 Iran
 and
 in


the
 region.
 And
 that's
 wildly
 different


than
 the
 first
 year
 of
 Trump's
 second


administration
 when
 he
 focused
 primarily


on
 tariffs
 and
 economic
 tools
 and
 where


many
 countries
 around
 the
 world
 were


very
 capable
 of
 hitting
 back
 and
 not


just
 capitulating
 and
 actively


negotiating
 but
 also
 using
 their
 own


coercive
 tools
 and
 mechanisms
 and


getting
 to
 a
 place
 that
 they
 felt
 um
 was


better
 than
 what
 they
 were
 initially


being
 demanded.
 that
 is
 not
 the
 case


militarily


uh
 either
 in
 Venezuela
 uh
 or
 in
 Iran
 um


or
 I
 suspect
 in
 Cuba
 going
 forward.
 And


where
 else
 might
 President
 Trump
 decide


that
 he
 really
 likes
 taking
 unilateral


military
 action
 that
 no
 one
 is
 willing


or
 capable
 to
 respond
 against?


>> Um
 how
 does
 that
 play
 though
 with
 MAGA?


How
 does
 that
 play
 with
 people
 who


really
 didn't
 want
 America
 to
 get


involved?
 Is
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 manages
 to


make
 this
 kind
 of
 short
 sharp
 kind
 of
 um


invasions
 and
 there's
 no
 boots
 on
 the


ground.
 Is
 that
 kind
 of
 the
 way
 that


Trump
 skirts
 round
 that?
 Because
 it


feels
 like
 in
 the
 last
 presidential


campaign
 he
 actually
 comp
 campaigned
 on


not
 starting
 wars
 and
 instead
 that


really
 has
 not
 been
 the
 case.
 Although


of
 course
 the
 definition
 of
 war
 is
 is
 a


little
 different
 if
 there
 aren't


actually
 soldiers
 and
 troops
 on
 the


ground,


>> right?
 I
 mean,
 if
 no
 American
 soldiers


are
 getting
 killed,
 um
 then
 it's
 a
 much


easier
 proposition
 for
 him
 to
 square


with
 his
 MAGA
 supporters.
 Um
 and
 in


Venezuela,
 knock
 on
 wood,
 no
 American
 uh


servicemen
 and
 women
 uh
 have
 been
 have


been
 killed.
 There
 were
 a
 few
 injuries


uh
 but
 no
 one
 was
 killed.
 And
 so
 far,


again,
 early
 hours,
 no
 Americans
 have


been
 killed.
 But,
 you
 know,
 certainly


Trump
 is
 prepared
 for
 Americans
 to
 be


killed.
 Combatants
 and
 and
 quite


plausibly
 non-combatants
 on
 the
 back
 of


this
 and
 and
 large
 numbers
 of
 Americans


killed
 because
 of
 a
 war
 of
 choice
 in


Iran
 will
 be
 unpopular
 with
 significant


numbers
 of
 Trump's
 MAGA
 base.
 There's


also
 uh
 there
 is
 a
 break
 in
 MAGA
 on


Israel.
 Um
 there
 are
 a
 number
 of
 strong


MAGA
 supporters
 and
 you've
 seen
 this


with
 Tucker
 Carlson
 in
 particular,
 but


there
 have
 been
 others
 that
 have
 been


out
 there
 publicly
 saying
 absolutely


not.
 Uh
 why
 why
 are
 we
 carrying
 so
 much


water
 for
 Israel?
 Why
 are
 we
 providing


them
 billions
 and
 billions
 of
 dollars
 in


military
 support?
 Uh
 why
 why
 are
 we


engaging
 in
 military
 actions
 that
 are


supporting
 what
 they
 want
 in
 their


backyard?
 I
 mean,
 on
 Ukraine,
 the
 United


States
 has
 stopped
 providing
 military


aid.
 Why?
 Because
 it's
 far
 away
 and
 we


think
 the
 Europeans
 should
 do
 it.
 So,


why
 are
 we
 supporting
 Israel
 and
 and


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 MAGA
 supporters
 that


don't
 like
 that?
 There
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 MAGA


supporters
 that
 do.
 Um,
 and
 there
 are a


lot
 of
 MAGA
 donors
 that
 do.
 I
 mean,


Miriam
 add
 in
 particular,
 but
 there
 are


many
 uh
 and
 that
 many
 that
 go
 to
 Mara


Lago
 all
 the
 time,
 just
 as
 there
 are


those
 that
 support
 military
 operations


in
 Venezuela
 and
 Cuba
 among
 the
 Miami


exile
 community.
 Um
 but
 but
 it
 is
 not


uniquely
 popular.
 And
 here
 there's
 a


broader
 we
 should
 address
 the
 broader


issue
 which
 is
 because
 you
 asked
 me,
 you


know,
 how
 is
 Trump
 dealing
 with
 the
 fact


that
 um
 he
 made
 these
 promises,
 he


campaigned
 on
 this
 stuff
 and
 there
 were


so
 many
 people
 pro
 MAGA
 that
 were
 saying


that,
 you
 know,
 Kla
 Harris
 was
 going
 to


be
 the
 war
 candidate,
 but
 Trump


wouldn't.
 Trump's
 not
 a
 hawk.
 Um
 and


Charlie
 Kirk,
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 he
 was


assassinated
 before
 that.
 He
 was


extremely
 opposed
 to
 the
 idea
 of


attacking
 um
 Iran
 and
 is
 on
 record
 in


doing
 so.
 And
 I
 I'm
 sure
 that
 there
 are


many
 opponents
 to
 Trump,
 including
 some


in
 Naga,
 that
 are
 going
 to
 be
 using


that.
 Now,
 Trump
 has
 made
 good
 on
 a


number
 of
 his
 promises.
 He
 promised
 that


he
 was
 going
 to
 use
 tariffs
 and
 he
 was


going
 to
 work
 to
 bring
 manufacturing


back
 to
 the
 US
 and
 force
 other
 countries


to
 spend
 money
 in
 the
 US.
 and
 he's
 cut
 a


bunch
 of
 deals
 with
 promises
 from
 the


Japanese
 and
 the
 South
 Koreans
 and
 the


UK
 and
 the
 Europeans
 and
 the
 Saudis
 and


others
 to
 start
 spending
 a
 lot
 more


money
 in
 the
 US.
 So
 he's
 whether
 you


like
 the
 policy
 or
 not,
 whether
 you


think
 tariffs
 are
 a
 good
 idea
 or
 not
 and


certainly
 there's
 an
 affordability


problem
 on
 the
 back
 of
 it,
 he's
 made


good
 on
 that.
 He
 promised
 he
 was
 going


to
 close
 the
 border
 and
 he
 has
 done
 a


lot
 of
 work
 in
 closing
 the
 border.
 He


promised
 he
 was
 going
 to,
 you
 know,


fight
 fentinel.
 He's
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 work


in
 fighting
 fentinel.
 The
 Mexicans
 have


been
 very
 very
 significant
 partners
 of


the
 US
 on
 that.


But
 he
 also
 promised
 that
 he
 was
 going


to
 America
 first
 to
 end
 these
 wars.
 And


while
 there
 are
 no
 troops
 on
 the
 ground,


it
 is
 now
 clear
 that
 unilateral
 American


military
 power
 is
 being
 used
 to
 project


outcomes
 that
 he
 wants
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 MAG


is
 clearly
 uncomfortable
 with,


especially
 in
 the
 Middle
 East.
 It's
 also


clear
 that
 the
 Epstein
 files
 where
 Trump


said,
 "I'm
 going
 to
 clean
 this
 place
 up


and
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 release
 those


files
 um
 because
 there's
 a
 two-tier


justice
 system."
 And
 and
 yet,
 you
 know,


Bill
 and
 Hillary
 Clinton
 will
 be
 brought


in
 to
 testify,
 but
 not
 Howard
 Lutnik.


And
 so,
 he's
 protecting
 his
 own.
 Um
 and


and
 everyone
 sees
 that.
 Um
 and
 and
 he
 he


said
 he
 was
 going
 to
 drain
 the
 swamp.
 He


doesn't
 talk
 about
 that
 anymore.
 And
 in


fact,
 he
 turns
 out
 not
 only
 was
 there
 a


lot
 of
 corruption
 in
 the
 US
 um
 under


previous
 administrations,
 but
 it's
 even


more
 corrupt
 now
 under
 under
 Trump.
 It's


kleptocratic,
 benefiting
 him
 and
 his


family
 directly
 and
 many
 insiders
 in
 the


administration
 and
 their
 families.
 So
 I


do
 think
 that
 the
 fact
 that
 Trump
 now
 on


a
 number
 of
 issues
 has
 absolutely
 not
 uh


followed
 through
 on
 promises
 that
 matter


deeply
 to
 MAGA
 are
 are
 why
 he
 is


hemorrhaging
 support
 and
 why
 he
 is
 very


likely
 overwhelmingly
 likely
 to
 lose
 the


house
 probably
 by
 a
 substantial
 margin


in
 November.
 And
 and
 that's
 he's
 running


out
 of
 time.
 It's
 it's
 getting
 harder


for
 him
 to
 turn
 that
 around
 every
 day.


And
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 unilateral


strikes
 on
 Iran
 with
 Israel
 um
 are
 are


going
 to
 change
 that.
 I
 I
 don't
 think


the
 Supreme
 Court's
 ruling
 on
 AIPA
 is


going
 to
 change
 that.
 I
 don't
 think
 that


uh
 the
 Minneapolis


um
 ICE
 efforts
 are
 going
 to
 change
 that.


I
 I I
 think
 that
 um
 he's
 in
 more
 trouble


uh
 over
 the
 last
 couple
 months.
 the


trajectory
 has
 been
 negative
 for
 him
 and


he's
 likely
 to
 become
 much
 more
 risk


acceptant
 as
 a
 consequence
 of
 that
 which


may
 well
 play
 out
 in
 other
 military


episodes
 internationally.


But
 why
 I
 mean
 why
 would
 why
 if
 things


are
 going
 badly
 and
 your
 numbers
 are


down
 do
 you
 I
 mean
 I
 understand
 why
 you


become
 more
 risk
 acceptant
 but
 actually


leaning
 into
 doing
 even
 more
 reckless


things
 feels
 like
 maybe
 the
 wrong


direction
 to
 head
 in.
 it
 it
 is
 something


he
 can
 do.
 It's
 it's
 power
 that
 he
 has.


He
 is
 if
 he
 were
 listening
 to
 his
 top


adviserss,
 he
 would
 be
 acting
 very


differently.
 I
 think
 the
 the
 Venezuelan


uh
 issue,
 he
 would
 have
 handled
 very


similarly.
 Uh
 but
 I
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,


the
 AIPA
 tariffs,
 he
 was
 told
 by
 his


secretary
 of
 treasury
 and
 by
 his
 US


trade
 rep,
 don't
 use
 this.
 It
 won't


stand
 up.
 and
 he
 obviously
 knows
 better


than
 they
 do
 because
 he's
 the
 president.


He's
 the
 one
 that
 won.
 And
 so
 he
 went


ahead
 and
 he
 did
 it.
 And
 then
 a
 year


later,
 less
 than
 a
 year
 later,
 the


Supreme
 Court,
 including
 his
 own


nominees,
 vote
 against
 him.
 And
 now
 it's


going to
 be
 harder
 for
 him.
 Now
 he's


going
 to
 be
 more
 constrained.
 So
 I
 mean,


I
 think
 the
 problem
 is
 that
 Trump
 is


very
 short-term.
 He's
 very,
 you
 know,


attached
 to
 the
 latest
 shiny
 object.
 He


constantly
 wants
 to
 make
 headlines
 and


he's
 incredibly
 undisiplined.
 So
 he
 does


not
 have
 the
 temperament
 to
 engage
 in


the
 strategic
 political
 revolution
 that


would
 allow
 him
 to
 um
 to
 more


effectively


uh
 build
 a
 presidency
 that
 is
 sits
 above


checks
 and
 balances.
 I
 I
 I
 think
 what


we're
 finding
 is
 increasingly
 he's


failing
 on
 a
 bunch
 of
 issues
 and
 as
 a


consequence
 you
 start
 to
 see
 whether


it's
 justices
 or
 whether
 it's
 members
 of


the
 military
 or
 whether
 it's
 Republican


leaders
 start
 to
 take
 public
 steps


against
 him
 and
 that
 wasn't
 happening
 3


months
 ago,
 6
 months
 ago,
 but
 now
 it
 is.


We
 we've
 seen
 it
 um
 on
 a
 number
 of


occasions
 and
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 see


more
 of
 it
 going
 forward.
 But
 I
 think


it's
 also
 true,
 isn't
 it,
 that
 some
 of


the
 people
 who've
 been
 giving
 him


advice,
 particularly
 on
 this
 war,
 some


of
 his
 military
 advisers
 actually
 then


got
 cast
 out.
 You
 know,


>> got
 cast
 out.
 That's
 right.


>> Right.
 So,
 does
 he
 really
 he
 really


believes
 that
 he
 can
 kind
 of
 do
 this


because
 he's
 the
 president,
 he
 can
 just


do
 this
 all
 by
 himself.


>> Well,
 these
 are
 relatively
 junior


people.
 Most
 of
 them.
 Most
 of
 them.


Because
 keep
 in
 mind
 that
 what
 Trump
 has


hired
 for
 this
 time
 around,
 some
 of
 his


adviserss
 are
 very
 capable
 in
 my


estimation,
 uh,
 like
 Marco
 Rubio
 and


Jameson
 Greer,
 some
 of
 them
 are


incredibly
 incompetent
 in
 my
 estimation,


like
 Pete
 Hegsath
 for
 example,
 or
 RFK.


Uh,
 but
 they
 all
 are
 incredibly
 loyal.


So
 unlike
 Trump's
 first
 year
 in
 his


first
 term
 of
 office
 where
 it
 was
 a


revolving
 door
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that


then
 were
 talking
 were
 leaking
 were


extremely
 opposed
 to
 Trump.
 This
 time


around
 we've
 seen
 virtually
 none
 of
 that


and
 it's
 been
 a
 relatively
 tight
 ship


because
 they
 all
 recognize
 that
 they're


going
 to
 do
 exactly
 what
 Trump
 wants
 or


else.
 I
 mean,
 the
 only
 major
 blow
 up


we've
 seen
 in
 the
 first
 year
 now
 of
 the


administration
 year
 plus
 was
 Elon
 Musk


who
 came
 out
 in
 spectacular
 fashion
 and


you
 know
 dished
 on
 the
 Epstein
 files
 and


said
 he
 was
 going
 to
 create
 a
 third


party
 and
 all
 of
 that
 basically
 grabbed


on
 to
 the
 third
 rail
 but
 backed
 away


from
 it.
 JD
 Vance
 facilitated
 a
 raproont


and
 now
 he's
 working
 with
 Trump
 again.


So
 I
 mean
 really
 there's
 been
 at
 the
 top


level
 there's
 been
 continued
 alignment


and
 willingness
 to
 go
 along
 with


whatever
 Trump
 is
 saying
 among
 that


inner
 circle
 and
 and
 that
 that


willingness
 to
 facilitate
 even
 things


that
 fail.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 again,
 we've
 seen


how
 many
 instances
 now
 where
 Trump
 has


gone
 after
 launch
 lawsuits
 on
 the
 six


Democrats
 um
 that
 did
 this
 video
 um
 that


opposed
 him.
 Um,
 and
 you
 know
 that


lawsuit
 blew
 up
 and
 you
 know
 he
 failed


and
 because
 he
 wasn't
 listening
 to


advisers
 and
 same
 thing
 with
 the
 lawsuit


against
 uh
 James
 Comey
 and
 Leticia
 James


and
 he
 failed
 and
 wasn't
 listening
 to


advisers
 but
 they
 are
 willing
 to
 do


whatever
 he
 says
 in
 all
 of
 these


instances
 whether
 it's
 about
 military


strikes
 or
 economic
 tariffs
 or
 about


taking
 efforts
 um
 to
 uh
 ensure
 that
 the


next
 election
 is
 not
 quote
 unquote


rigged
 like
 the
 FBI
 investigation
 and


the
 seizing
 of
 the
 ballot
 boxes
 in


Fulton
 County
 in
 Georgia.
 All
 of
 these


are
 unprecedented
 acts,
 but
 they're


unprecedented
 acts
 that
 President
 Trump


is
 ordering
 and
 that
 his
 inner
 circle,


his
 direct
 reports
 and
 his
 cabinet
 are


100%
 supporting.
 Not
 even
 not
 a
 not
 a
 an


inch
 of
 space
 between
 Trump
 and
 those


people.


>> All right,
 let's
 head
 back
 to
 the
 Middle


East.
 And
 you
 mentioned
 earlier
 the
 idea


of
 asymmetric
 warfare.
 So
 if
 Iran
 has


used
 up
 its
 missile
 um
 you
 know
 armory


but
 the
 reality
 is
 that
 no
 one
 can


actually
 dictate
 what
 happens
 with


asymmetric
 warfare.
 What
 do
 you
 think


happening
 for
 instance
 with
 the
 Houthis


or
 with
 the
 Straits
 of
 Hormuz?
 Is
 that


going
 to
 get
 closed?
 Like
 what
 do
 you


think
 is
 going
 to
 happen?
 What
 are
 the


ripple
 effects
 of
 this
 I
 guess
 in
 the


region?
 Yeah,
 that's
 the
 most


significant
 market
 impact
 and
 and
 it


might
 be
 the
 most
 significant


vulnerability
 that
 um
 that
 American


servicemen
 and
 women
 have
 is
 is
 to
 the


ships,
 both
 tanker
 traffic
 directly
 and


military
 ships
 uh
 going
 through
 the


straits
 of
 Hormuz
 in
 the
 Red
 Sea
 and


more
 broadly.
 And
 um
 the
 Houthis
 have


shown
 that
 they
 have
 um
 a
 a
 capacity
 to


make
 strikes
 against
 these
 boats


including
 like
 off
 the
 Horn
 of
 Africa
 in


the
 Indian
 Ocean
 even
 more
 broadly.
 So
 I


mean
 I
 do
 think
 that
 there
 is
 a
 pretty


high
 likelihood
 that
 for
 at least
 a


period
 of
 time
 that
 the
 straits
 of


Hormuz
 will
 be
 impassible.
 And
 that


means
 that
 oil
 prices
 which
 have
 already


spiked
 on
 these
 strikes
 and
 in


anticipation
 of
 these
 strikes
 with
 with


lots
 of
 oil
 on
 the
 market
 right
 now
 um


and
 with
 relatively
 low
 demand


um
 for
 oil
 um
 those
 prices
 are
 going
 up.


Natural
 gas,
 same
 thing.
 um
 you're
 going


to
 have
 difficulty
 in
 getting
 that
 gas


to
 Europe.
 Um
 and
 that
 means
 that
 those


prices
 are
 going
 up.
 Um
 you
 know,
 huge


amount
 of
 American
 military
 capability,


mind
 sweepers,
 the
 rest.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 I


don't
 believe
 that
 um
 the
 the
 straits


will
 be
 impassible
 for
 long.
 I'd
 be


surprised
 if
 it
 was
 more
 than
 a
 matter


of,
 you
 know,
 inside
 a
 few
 days,
 outside


a
 couple
 weeks.
 I'd
 be
 surprised
 if
 it


went
 longer
 than
 that.
 Um
 but
 there'll


be
 continuing
 threat
 um
 to
 tankers
 um


and
 that
 means
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 those


tankers
 may
 end
 up
 um
 having
 to
 go
 the


long
 way
 and
 costing
 an
 awful
 lot
 more


money
 as
 a
 consequence.


>> All
 right.
 So
 in
 in
 to
 wrap
 this
 up,
 I'm


curious
 what
 you're
 watching
 most


closely
 in
 the
 next
 few
 days
 and
 over


the
 next
 few
 weeks.


>> Um
 most
 closely
 I'm
 watching
 internally


Iran.
 I
 want
 to
 see
 what
 kind
 of


demonstrations
 we
 see,
 what
 kind
 of


instability
 and
 how
 much
 of
 that
 gets


out
 visav
 Telegram
 and
 other
 sources


because
 it's
 not
 like
 there's
 an
 open


media
 that
 can
 actually
 report
 on
 it.


Um,
 do
 we
 see
 some
 towns
 um
 that
 are


farther
 away,
 you
 know,
 Tehran,
 away


from
 Tehran,
 where
 you
 have
 ethnic


minorities,
 for
 example,
 where,
 you


know,
 it's
 harder
 uh
 where
 there
 are


Kurds,
 uh,
 where
 there
 are
 others
 that


it's
 much
 harder
 for
 the
 Iranian
 central


government
 to
 actually
 have
 complete


control.
 We've
 seen
 with
 the
 Green


Revolution
 before,
 there
 were
 much


bigger
 demonstrations
 and
 a
 lot
 of


violence
 outside
 of
 Tehran.
 That
 would


be
 interesting
 to
 watch.
 uh
 for
 example,


as
 well
 as
 we
 want
 to
 see
 what
 kind
 of


statements
 are
 being
 made
 by
 the
 Iranian


leadership
 and
 who's
 making
 them.
 So


far,
 I
 mean,
 early
 hours
 we've
 not
 we've


seen
 very
 little.
 We've
 seen
 fog
 of
 war


and
 the
 foreign
 minister
 make
 some


statements,
 but
 that's
 about
 it.
 So,
 I


mean,
 you
 know,
 really
 it
 is
 early
 early


days.
 You
 want
 to
 see
 what's
 left
 of
 the


Iranian
 regime
 and
 what
 kind
 of


opposition
 you
 see
 internally.
 More


broadly
 than
 that,
 uh
 we
 want
 to
 see
 uh


what
 kind
 of
 reaction
 we
 get
 across
 the


region.
 Do
 we
 see
 uh
 effective
 um


activity
 uh
 by
 the
 Houthis
 in
 Yemen?
 Um


do
 we
 see
 terrorist
 activity
 um
 that
 um


that
 leads
 to
 bigger
 strikes
 against


civilians?


um
 you
 know,
 do
 we
 see
 a
 front
 the
 the


Hezbollah
 Lebanon
 front
 open
 up


completely
 uh
 with
 Israel
 deciding
 that


this
 is
 a
 great
 opportunity
 to
 just
 mop


that
 up
 um
 after
 only
 limited
 strikes


over
 the
 past
 months.
 That's
 certainly


very
 plausible
 in
 this
 environment.
 Um


so
 lots
 lots
 of
 things
 to
 watch.
 Um
 but


uh
 but
 again
 in
 an
 environment
 where


it's
 hard
 to
 imagine
 major
 escalation,


this
 is
 not
 going
 to
 become
 a
 regional


war.
 This
 is
 certainly
 not
 going
 to


become
 World
 War
 III.
 It's
 much
 more


about
 what
 happens
 on
 the
 ground,


frankly,
 in
 Iran.
 That
 is
 the
 biggest


thing
 we're
 looking
 at.
 And
 in
 that


regard,
 very
 similar
 to
 right
 after


Maduro
 was
 captured,
 what
 we
 were


watching
 was
 what
 was
 happening
 on
 the


ground
 in
 Karakas
 and
 across
 Venezuela.


There's
 a
 lot
 more
 uncertainty
 for
 Iran


than
 there
 is
 for
 Venezuela,
 but
 the


basic
 sorts
 of
 questions
 are
 actually


very
 similar.


Ian,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 um
 unlike
 the


Europeans
 taking
 time
 on
 your
 Saturday


to
 come
 and
 talk
 about
 this.
 We
 are
 so


grateful
 to
 have
 your
 wisdom
 and
 um


thank
 you
 for
 tracking
 all
 of
 this.
 We


will,
 I'm
 sure,
 see
 you
 again
 soon.


>> Always
 great
 to
 talk
 to
 you.
