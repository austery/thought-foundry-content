>> As of November 1st,
Ontarians were hit with a 29%
electricity rate hike, but
Premier Doug Ford will also be
hiking the electricity subsidy,
meaning the sticker shock won't
be as substantial.
What's driving the spike?
And does spending billions
in subsidies make sense?
Green leader Mike Schreiner
certainly doesn't think so.
>> Ratepayers won't feel the
full brunt of this dramatic
price increase brought on by
the Ford government, because
they've increased the amount of
money subsidising electricity
prices, which have been over $6
billion a year, likely climbing,
according to the Financial
Accountability Officer.
Disproportionately benefiting
wealthy households at the
expense of working people.
>> Then more and more Canadians
say they don't support 100%
tariffs on Chinese electric
vehicles, up from 27% in 2024
to 47% this year, according to
Nanos.
Is there a way that the
feds could change or scrap them
without hurting our auto sector
and angering Trump?
Welcome to The Rundown.
Electricity prices are rising
in Ontario, and in response,
Premier Doug Ford is hiking
the electricity subsidies.
But what's behind the increase?
Do the rebates make sense,
or is there a way
we could drive down costs
in the first place?
I asked Mark Winfield,
associate professor
at the Faculty of Environmental
and Urban Change at York
University.
Mark, great to have you
on the program.
How are you doing today?
>> Great.
Thanks very much.
>> All right.
Let's start with you connecting
the dots for us.
What is the relationship
between new nuclear projects
that are happening in this
province and the increase
in electricity rates?
>> Well, I think what we're
seeing is the beginning of
the impact of the province's
commitment around nuclear.
I mean, what we're seeing
already is the beginnings of
rate increases.
Now, those at the moment are
probably mostly related to
the refurbishment projects
of existing facilities.
But what we need to look at
down the road is the impact of
the very large nuclear
expansion program that the Ford
government has set in motion,
and that will inevitably have a
very large impact on rates in
terms of moving them upwards.
>> Is it fair to say, with the
government's push for nuclear,
that these rates and these
increases are fairly permanent?
>> I think so.
I mean, if the government stays
on the pathway it's on,
which is this overwhelming
commitment not just to
the refurbishment of
existing facilities, but but
a series of major new build
projects that Wesleyville at
the Bruce site and at the
Darlington site.
We are effectively embedding
very, very high costs into
the system in the long term.
>> All right.
So the so the province is going
all in on this very expensive.
And what you have written
as untested technology,
things that haven't actually
been built before.
Help us understand that.
But also is there no sort of
provincial oversight body that
would be monitoring the this
build, the cost, the technology?
>> Well, two questions there.
One around the one new build
reactor project, which is
underway, which is the what's
called a small modular reactor
at Darlington.
No, it's not modular at all.
And that would be the first
of its kind in the world.
So it is untested, and
it's certainly one that
Canadian regulators have never
seen before.
It uses a type of fuel
we've not seen used in
Canadian reactors that requires
enriched uranium, which we
don't actually have the
capacity to produce in Canada.
We'd be relying on the United
States, which makes it a
strange choice from an energy
security perspective.
In terms of oversight.
The short answer is no.
There is no oversight or
review process around these
plans.
A combination of steps taken
by the previous Wynne
government and the previous
and the current government
effectively eliminated what
what oversight and review
process we have.
So the system is effectively
running on political
directives from the minister's
office and the Premier's
office, and the various
agencies are mandated by
statute to implement the
directions laid out in those
directives, whether whether
they make sense or not.
>> Well, help us understand
that when we think about energy
and electricity specifically,
I'm thinking of ISO, the
independent electricity system
operator.
We have the Ontario
Energy Board as well.
What do they do if not
monitoring any of this?
>> Well, the board has some
oversight of rates, but but it
has explicitly no mandate to
review the overall strategy
or plans, which the provinces
articulated that that role was
eliminated back in 2015, so
that that element is is not
present.
I mean, the closest we get
is in rate hearings where
some of this gets revealed, but
there's no point at which the
board looks at the overall plan
and ask questions about, is
this the most cost effective or
prudent or lowest carbon option
available to the province in
terms of the Independent
electricity system operator?
It's independent, a somewhat
complicated question.
It has a degree of
independence in terms of
the actual day to day,
minute to minute operation of
the electricity market, of sort
of aligning supply and demand
on an on going basis.
But it has certainly no
regulatory role.
And and its planning functions
are deeply attenuated, again,
by the fact that it is
fundamentally subject to the
directives issued from the
political level.
Its job is to implement
those those directives, not
really to ask questions about
do they make sense
or are there different pathways
the province could be
considering that might offer
a lower cost and more reliable
and safer pathway forward?
>> All right.
Let's have a look at
electricity rates in Ontario.
I want to show this chart.
This is dating back to 2006.
Looking at 2024 you can see
in the green line that's your
off-peak, in yellow mid-peak
and red on peak.
The off-peak in green.
You can see in 2006 starting
just under $0.04 per kilowatt
hour to about just under ten.
And if you look at all three
rates kind of doubling in that,
now should mention that these
new rates are not included in
this data.
But I am curious what's
important to understand
about previous rate increases
under other governments.
>> Well, what's happening here
is a number of things.
I mean, some of this
is also just accounted by
straight, straightforward
inflation.
But more fundamentally,
we've been through a period.
We went through a long period
of sort of disruption
in the 1980s and 1990s
when there was very little
investment in the system.
And so when we reached about
the beginning of the 2000, 2003,
there's a realisation about 80%
of the system needed to be
either refurbished or replaced
or rebuilt, and that was going
to require significant capital
investments.
Whatever choices you made.
And that is part of what
you're then seeing reflected
in the rate increases is
as if we had a house and
we'd done nothing with the roof
for 20 years, and now all kinds
of repairs need to happen.
So that explains,
in large part, the steady
increase in rates over this
past 20 year period is
we've been in a period of
reconstruction.
Now there are debates.
Did we pay too much for
nuclear refurbishments?
Did we pay too much for
renewables?
But the fundamental trajectory,
I think was was going to be
upwards during this period
because we were in a period of
reconstruction, after an
extensive period of capital
under-investment or non
investment in the system.
>> All right.
As you mentioned, it seems
like energy in this province
is very political.
The Ontario government
is also mentioning that they
are boosting the Ontario
electricity rate by 2 billion
to 8.5 billion, a lot of money
there to cover the increased
rates.
What happens?
Rebates are not permanent.
So what happens if governments
decide to roll back
these rebates?
>> Well that's that's an
interesting question at this
stage.
I mean the rebates are
in place so far as we know,
indefinitely.
Presumably the bottom line
of what people pay on
their electricity bills
would rise if if the rebate
program were terminated and
nothing else changes.
I think the question is
that the government does have
some agency to control
future costs,
but that's going to be
a function of the choices
it makes at the moment.
It's making choices
in direction of very, very
high cost options in terms of
new build nuclear, and has been
emphatic in its rejection of
lower cost options like
renewables, or that we're
discussing with imports from
Quebec and a number of other
options.
So so part of the problem is
that that we've got the
rebates, which are eating a
larger and larger piece of the
provincial budget, but we're
also embedding higher costs
going forward, which which also
has to be a major concern.
>> Can you explain sort of take
us through a little bit of a
history lesson here in terms of
the transparency between these
rebates versus under the
conservative government versus
the Liberal government?
Because I know there is
some criticism there as well.
>> Yeah.
I mean, the this notion of
of effectively hiding
electricity costs goes back
a long way.
I mean, this happened
during the Davis government
when it effectively hid the
costs of of the original
nuclear construction program
in Ontario's hydro debt until
until that reached the point
where Ontario Hydro ceased to
be viable.
The current version really
goes back to the wind
government's Fair Hydro plan in
2017, where they took $0.25 off
hydro rates overnight.
That was largely done by
refinancing it
and effectively adding to debt
in the long term.
In fairness to
the conservative government,
at least they are more
transparent about what's going
on in a sense that they're
they're paying this out of
current expenditures.
So it's very clear
what this is costing.
The concern is, though, that
this is eating a larger
and larger portion of the
provincial budget at 8.5
billion.
That's two thirds of
the current deficit.
It's more than they spend
on the entire justice sector.
So this this must be reaching
some kind of upper limit.
And it's really, in a sense,
unsustainable in the long term.
But that's that's sort of
where at least we have
a degree of transparency
about what's happening.
But I think that then
begs questions about both.
Should we be subsidising to
this level, given the pressing
needs in other areas in the
province and health care and
education and day-care
everything else?
And also, how are we going to
control these costs
going forward?
>> Mark, we are going to leave
it there.
Really appreciate your time
and your insights on this.
>> Great.
Thank you very much.
>> Chinese EVs are seen as
practical and affordable,
but you won't see them
on Canadian roads.
And that's because the
Trudeau Liberals slapped a 100%
tariff on them in 2024.
Flash forward to 2025.
Things are different.
The relationship between
China and Canada is beginning
to thaw, and the federal
government is trying to
diversify our trade
relationships.
So talk has ramped up about
lifting that tariff.
So what should Prime Minister
Mark Carney do?
I got insight from
Joanna Kyriazis, director of
policy and strategy
at Clean Energy Canada, and
Addisu, an associate professor
of strategic management at
McMaster University's DeGroote
School of Business and a
non-resident fellow at the
Brookings Institution.
Addisu, Joanna, welcome to
The Rundown.
How are you to doing?
>> Well, thanks.
Thank you.
>> All right.
Let's start our conversation
with a poll.
This was released by
Nanos Research in October.
It illustrates diminishing
support among Canadians
for the 100% tariff rate
on Chinese made electric
vehicles.
Now, the poll showed that
22% of Canadian respondents--
That's in the green right
there.
--support the tariff versus 43%
last year.
Now, 27% of respondents
somewhat opposed the tariff.
That's in the pink colour
versus 17% last year.
And in red, 20% of respondents
outright oppose the tariff,
compared to 10% last year.
Joanna, I want to come to you
first.
What factors are pushing
Canadians to reconsider their
support for this tariff?
>> I think at least two factors
are at play here.
So first, Canada followed
the US in applying
in 100% tariff on Chinese EVs
about a year ago,
and the idea was that it was
meant to buy our domestic
auto sector time to ramp up
its own EV production
and be able to compete.
But instead, what we've seen
is a number of EV related
projects being cancelled,
EV ambitions being backtracked.
And so that tariff isn't really
working as as originally,
you know, it was supposed to.
The second is, I think
that Canadians are seeing
a number of other regions
around the world benefiting
from lower priced EV models,
whether it's the EU, Australia,
the UK, and they would be
interested in getting their
hands on on similarly priced EV
models here in Canada because
they know it saves them
a lot of money on on fuel
and maintenance costs
year after year.
>> Well, let's pick up on that.
Addisu, Joanna had mentioned
the EU has a significant auto
industry and yet permits the
sale of different made in China
electric vehicles.
Walk us through how
the EU determines different
rates for these vehicles.
Now, unlike Canada, these range
from 8% up to about 35%.
So help us connect the dots.
How does it work?
>> Yeah.
So as you mentioned,
adoption of EVs in the EU are
much larger than in Canada.
I think in Canada it's about
10% now, a bit below 10%.
In many European countries,
it's more than 60%.
Norway actually 90%.
So that partly has to do with
better access to EVs, many of
them made in China.
And the EV two had a
complaints about significant
government subsidies
on EV makers in China.
They did make a very in-depth
investigation a few years ago,
I think a couple of years ago
now, as they concluded that
there have been significant
transfer of resources from
the government and public owned
banks to EV makers in China.
So but what they did was instead
of placing a blanket ban or a
tariff on all EV imports from
China, they made a very
discriminating countervailing
duty, meaning that they imposed
a duty that was proportional to
the amount of subsidy that EV
maker was receiving.
So that ranged between, as you
mentioned, 8% and 35%.
I think that was kind of
a measured approach that was
convenient for EV adoption,
but also at the same time
compensating for
disproportionate support
provided to EV makers in China
as well.
>> All right, Joanna, I'll get
you to add on that as well.
We see sort of the response
there.
But how have EU automakers
responded to the entry of these
vehicles into the local markets?
>> Yeah.
Well, I think the concern is
that Chinese EVs would come into
the EU and totally take over.
And they have done
very well.
They're popular with drivers,
but we haven't quite seen that
takeover that others were
concerned about in most
EU markets.
Chinese EVs make up
less than 10% of EV market
share.
But what the entry of
Chinese EVs has done in the EU
is it's stimulated competition
and driven domestic automakers
to start introducing their own
lower priced models.
So we did an analysis
recently that found the EU
has over 20 EV models
available under the price point
of about $40,000 Canadian.
Seven of those are Chinese EVs,
but ten are actually coming
from EU automakers as they step
up to compete and try to meet
more of the market.
>> So competition is good.
>> For consumers?
Absolutely.
If we want high quality and
lower priced vehicles, then
then competition is good.
And if we want Canada's
auto sector to thrive
in the future, you know,
we've got to learn how to
produce high quality,
competitively priced
electric vehicles.
>> All right.
Addisu, you had talked
about the assessment that
the EU had done, could
Canada simply follow the EU's
lead in adding terrorists based
on the level of Chinese subsidy
by company, or should it start
from the beginning
and do its own?
>> So I think the in-depth
investigation by the EU
provides some basis,
some starting point.
Obviously, things might have
changed since then,
and also Canada might have
a different lens in terms of
how it ways different kinds
of support measures
to EV makers.
So I would say that EVs
comprehensive report
very in-depth.
It provides a very good
starting point, but Canada
could consider refining that
and building on that.
Obviously, this kind of
thorough investigative
approach is also supported
by the WTO.
If you are convinced
or if you can provide evidence
that the trading partner
is providing subsidies,
you have you are
just fighting for the
countervailing duty as well.
So that makes it legitimate,
I think.
And they use reporting
could be a good starting point.
>> Addisu I want to stick with
you.
Joanna had mentioned the
US in the opening remarks there.
How does Canada's tariffs on
Chinese EVs increase our
dependence on the US?
>> Yeah, so as John mentioned,
also in the EU markets, Chinese
EV makers are gaining
ascendance.
They are not dominant by
any measure, but they have
significantly succeeded
compared to American EV makers,
which are not really
that competitive.
So on the price point,
but also on the basis of
quality and innovation
and new features coming in
as well.
So I think if you compare
the European Union market and
Canadian market, you will see
that American automakers
dominate here.
JMM is the leading
EV maker here, sailor here.
But in the EU, actually
it's mainly European firms
followed by Chinese firms
as well.
So I think this is a
distortionary effect of the
tariff wall, which is obviously
harming consumers here.
>> Joanna, if Canada does
permit the sale of Chinese EVs,
what does that mean for the
billions of dollars governments,
private companies have invested
in EV battery plants?
Look at Saint Thomas.
You look at Windsor.
What does that signal?
>> We have attracted about
$50 billion in investments in
Canada EV battery supply chain
over the last few years.
Canada right now is ranked
number two in the world
for EV battery
supply chain potential.
But while the previous
government really focussed on
attracting investments in
some of those downstream
portions of the supply chain
like battery manufacturing
and EV assembly, experts have
always believed that Canada's
real competitive advantages
were more in the upstream
and midstream portions
of the battery supply chain,
like critical minerals, battery
materials, battery components.
And so I'm really seeing a
shift in focus where as some of
these EV assembly plants are
getting cancelled or delayed,
perhaps we want to double down
on those upstream competitive
advantages and really position
our industries to to feed into
those.
And we're already seeing
that happen.
You know, Prime Minister
Carney and various premiers
have put critical minerals
at the centre of our
economic strategy
and our plans to secure Canada's
energy sovereignty.
Half of the nation
building projects that have
been announced to date are in
critical minerals, many of
which are would produce inputs
that go into EV batteries,
whether it's copper mine in
B.C., graphite projects in
Quebec and Ontario, a nickel
mine in Ontario, a tungsten
mine in New Brunswick.
And so I think I think this is
sort of where we can focus on
securing jobs and investment,
and it will also help
in our trade diversification
efforts, because these
critical minerals
and battery materials are a lot
easier to export globally and
are in very high demand,
with some in some of the
jurisdictions that we're trying
to strengthen our trade
relationships, whether it's the
EU, South Korea, Japan.
>> If negotiations take place
between the Canadian government
and Chinese EV makers, what
else could Carney and the
Liberal government demand from
them to make the the current
ecosystem better?
>> Obviously, there's an
ongoing trade war, supposedly
a reciprocal response to
the tariffs on EVs.
The Chinese have imposed
significant tariffs between
76% and 100% on Canada imports
as well, thus leading to
a significant loss of revenue,
something canola producers
in Western Canada.
That would be a starting point.
I think the Chinese have hinted
that they would be willing to
retreat to scrap some of those
tariff measures.
Obviously, I think that
would be an incentive
for Canada as well to
reduce significantly
the tariffs, which are very
unusually large as well.
>> Joanna, I'll get your take
on that as well.
>> Yeah, I think there's a lot
of other conditions that we
could consider if we start
letting in Chinese EVs, maybe
at some requirements to invest
in Canada, like Addisu was just
talking about.
Maybe it's requirements to
be using Canadian inputs.
So purchasing those
Canadian critical minerals
and feeding them into some of
the Chinese battery or
EV assembly plants, it could be
around employing Canadian
workers, engaging in skills
and technology transfer.
And then we could even consider,
you know, environmental or
labour conditions that we
would want to apply on
any sort of production
or input of of Chinese EVs.
>> Joanna, I am curious to know,
you know, viewers who are
watching this are probably the
first question is probably when,
when will I get my hands on a
Chinese electric vehicle?
And I'm curious,
help us understand sort of
the tricky situation that
the current government's in.
There is a negotiation, a deal
that needs to be made end of
next year with the US and
Mexico.
Does that play into talking
about Kuzma?
But does that have any play
in sort of when a sort of
timeline between
the Liberal government
and the Chinese work together
on something?
>> Absolutely.
The federal government is
engaged in a very tricky
balance where we are stuck
between these two major
trading partners of the US,
where, of course, you know,
Trump has taken a very
anti-China approach to building
up its EV or auto
and other supply chains.
And as you said, we're on
the eve of the Kuzma
renegotiation.
So we don't want
to get offside of the US.
On the other hand,
we're trying to strengthen
our trade relationships
with other countries
including China.
And as Addisu mentioned,
other sectors of
the Canadian economy have
been impacted by the the
collateral damage of this 100%
tariff on Chinese EVs, whether
it's the canola industry,
the pork industry, the seafood
industry.
And then finally, we've got
the consumers and the drivers
in Canada that we need to be
considering who, you know,
over or almost half of
Canadians lean towards an EV
for their next vehicle,
and they know it will
save them money.
But the upfront cost is
still a barrier.
And so we we hope that
the federal government can find
a sweet spot where we're
balancing industry protection,
national unity, and also
delivering more affordable
vehicles to Canadian drivers
at a time when cost of living
are high.
>> Addisu I'll get you to add
on that as well.
>> Yeah, so I think the tariffs
are are not popular in Canada.
They're hurting consumers.
The latest average figure
I saw for a new EV car
is about $63,000.
It's a significant amount.
So consumers would have
a much better access to
affordable EVs if it were
not for the tariff walls.
So they are harming our
environmental goals and targets
as well.
Obviously, the main reason why
the government is reluctant to
scrap them is because of
the the negotiations,
the negotiations which are
unfolding now.
And I think by July next year
we'd have to resolve that one.
That would be the earliest
time, I think the
government, the federal
government might scrape
the cap walls.
But even then, you know,
I'm I think that the American
administration have shown that
regardless of arguments,
it might have side.
It's willing to retract them
and go outside
the bounds of the law to
enforce what it considers
to be an important economic
imperative to it.
So even after the signing
of the agreement,
I think the Americans might
not be happy with us scraping
the tariffs, but that could
still continue to be a problem.
Yeah.
>> All right.
My last question to you.
In the one or two minutes
that we have left, I want to
talk about the zero emission
vehicle mandate.
Obviously this was removed
to help alleviate pressure
on automakers.
Under what conditions?
Joanna, should
the Carney government maybe
reinstate it to help automakers
increase sales of electric
vehicles?
>> We would really like to see
that policy stay in place.
That is a consumer first
policy that ensures the
Canadian market is prioritised.
When global automakers are
deciding where to send
their electric vehicles.
That policy has shown also to
be effective at driving down
the price of EVs, as carmakers
need to meet increasingly
stringent targets and deliver
EVs that are, you know,
available for or meet more of
the mainstream market.
I would also say from a carbon
pollution standpoint, you know,
this is the main policy that
we have on the books to cut
pollution in our auto sector.
>> All right.
We are going to have to
leave it there.
Joanna, Addisu, really
appreciate your insights
on this one.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
>> Thanks for having us.
>> What do you want to see
on The Rundown?
We want this to be your show.
So take our survey at
tvo.org/rundownfeedback
and tell us what topics
matter to you.
Until then, we'll see you
next week.
