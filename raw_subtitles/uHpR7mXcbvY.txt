>> In the lead up to the last
US presidential election,
Donald Trump kept repeating one
thing he'd end the Russian war
on Ukraine on day one.
But here we are, almost a year
into his second term
and the biggest, bloodiest
conflict Europe has
seen since the Second World War
rages on.
Thousands have died
and it can feel like there's no
end in sight.
So where do things actually
stand?
How close are we
to a peace deal?
And what's giving Ukrainians
hope after years of hardship
and loss?
Then today is Human Rights Day,
and we're taking a hard look at
where Canada needs to step up.
And we're asking a
big question is the safe third
country agreement with the US
actually helping refugees or
failing them?
Welcome to The Rundown.
Oleksandra Matviychuk
is chairwoman of the centre for
Civil Liberties, the same group
that won the Nobel Peace Prize
in 2022.
Since the Russian invasion,
she's been raising awareness
of war crimes and
other human rights abuses.
I sat down with her
to talk about democracy,
diplomacy and the role
Donald Trump is playing in
peace talks.
Oleksandra, thank you so
much for taking the time.
How are you today?
>> I'm fine.
Thank you for your invitation.
>> Recently, we have seen a
flurry of diplomatic efforts to
bring a peace deal between
Ukraine and Russia.
Yet you recently wrote
a piece titled
Transactional Diplomacy cannot
bring Peace to Ukraine.
What do you mean
by transactional diplomacy?
>> I mean that when you based
your political decision only on
geopolitical interests, even if
you benefit in the short term,
we will all await for
catastrophe in the long term.
And that's why we must base our
decision not only on
geopolitical interests, but on
human rights and freedom.
>> In terms of the the
negotiations that are happening
right now.
What do you think is missing
from those if it's not
transactional diplomacy?
What should they be
focusing on?
>> Look what's going on.
In recent months we heard a
lot about natural minerals,
Russia's territorial claims,
geopolitical interests, even
about Zelensky's youth.
But we didn't hear about people.
And it's not okay.
We still have no idea
what will be.
With more than 20,000
Ukrainian children separated
with their families
and illegally deported to
Russia.
What will be with
thousands and thousands
illegally detained civilians,
men and women, as well as
prisoners of war, subjected to
horrible torture and sexual
abuse daily.
And what will be
with people in Russian
occupation?
In general?
We speak about millions,
millions of people who live in
grey zone.
They have no tools how to
defend their rights, their
freedom, their property, their
life, their children and their
loved ones.
So we must return
human dimension into
negotiation process, because
without human dimension,
we will never find a path to
sustainable peace.
>> Were you surprised that
US-Russia talks were unable to
secure a deal with Ukraine?
>> No surprise, because Putin
doesn't want peace.
Putin started large scale war
not just to occupy
more part of Ukrainian land.
It's not the war for
Avdiivka or Bakhmut.
Majority of Russians can't find
this tiny Ukrainian cities in
the map.
Putin started large scale war
because he want to occupy
and destroy the whole
Ukraine and move further.
He see Ukraine as a breach to
Europe.
His logic is historical.
He dreams about his legacy.
He wants to forcibly restore
Russian Empire.
So in order to make Putin stop,
it's not enough to roll in
a red carpet.
We must demonstrate strength to
make Putin understand that it's
impossible for him to achieve
his goal.
>> You were part of a group
that started initiative called
called tribunal for Putin.
What is the objective
and how is this different from
sort of the other work that
this centre for
Civil Liberties has done?
>> We was the first human
rights organisation who sent
mobile groups to work on
documentation of war crimes in
Crimea and eastern regions in
Ukraine in 2014.
But when large scale war
started, we faced with
enormous amount of crimes.
So we built national network of
local documentations and
covered the whole country,
including the occupied
territories.
And now in our database of
tribunal for Putin initiative,
we have more than
91,000 episodes of war crimes,
which is a huge amount, but
still just a tip of iceberg.
And all this atrocities are
possible only because Putin and
his surrounding decided to
break the peace and to start
this bloody war.
So they must be accountable.
And that's why
we are advocating to create a
special tribunal on aggression.
>> You speak of accountability,
but there are institutions
already the International Court
of Justice.
You have the European Union
as well.
Why do you feel we need
this tribunal?
>> Because we have
accountability gap.
There is no international
court which can prosecute
Putin for the crime
of aggression.
But it's not just important
for Ukrainians.
If you want to prevent wars in
the future, we have to punish
the states and the leaders who
start such wars in present.
It sounds like a common sense,
but even International Criminal
Court in The Hague has no
jurisdiction to prosecute
for the crime of aggression.
In situation of Russian war
of aggression against Ukraine.
So we must to fill this gap
and to create such special
tribunal to,
to to show that if you will
start the war in the future,
you will be punished.
>> Do you feel that these
institutions have let
Ukrainians down?
I know you speak of the gaps
there, but these institutions
that I had mentioned.
>> It's a general problem.
I don't know how
historians in future will call
this historical period,
but the world order,
which is based on UN charter
and international law,
is collapsing before our eyes.
This system was created
after the Second World War to
prevent wars and mass violence.
But now we just stolen and
reproducing ritualistic
movements for the obvious
reason.
Even my smartphone has
an expiration date.
This system
has never been reformed.
Now it's totally paralysed
with a veto power of Russia
in Security Council.
>> I'd like to ask you about
something you wrote in a recent
essay, and you write, current
generations inherited democracy
from their grandparents.
They began to take it
for granted.
They've become consumers of
democracy.
Their understanding
of freedom is the opportunity
to choose between different
cheeses.
In the supermarket.
We are living very different
realities as Canadians compared
to Ukrainians right now.
Help us understand what is
the downside of taking democracy
for granted.
>> The direct impact is that
current generations in
well-developed democracies,
they first start to put into
questions the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
And second, they start to
exchange their freedoms for
populist claim for economic
benefits.
And first and foremost,
for their own comfort.
They forget that you can't
attain your freedom and human
rights once and forever.
We make our own choice
every day.
>> Despite everything that your
country has gone through.
What gives Ukrainians
like you hope?
>> I think we must define the
hope properly, because hope is
not a confidence that
everything will be fine.
Hope.
It's a deep understanding that
all our efforts have a huge
meaning.
And I know from my own
experience being a human rights
lawyer in situation when the
law doesn't work, that when you
can't rely on the international
system of peace and security,
you can still rely on people,
and ordinary people can do
extraordinary things.
>> Aleksandra, we're going to
leave it there.
Thank you so much and wishing
you all the best.
>> Thank you very much.
>> According to the feds, the
safe third country agreement is
supposed to help Canada and the
United States better manage
access to each country's
refugee system.
That's the government messaging.
But how does it actually work?
TVO Today producer Adit Dixit
digs in to the fine print.
>> There's a quiet rule between
Canada, the US that decides
what country a person fleeing
danger has to ask for safety in.
It's called the Safe Third
Country Agreement.
But what is it exactly?
>> It's supposed to limit the
ability of asylum seekers to
claim asylum in Canada if
they've passed through the
United States.
>> It meant that if someone
reached the Canada-US border,
the first country that they
came through would be the
country that would take on
their protection claim unless
they qualified for an exception.
So if someone arrives in Canada
first, Canada is responsible
for hearing that claim.
But if they arrive in the US
first, then the US is
responsible for hearing
that claim.
>> This was in many ways a
Canadian driven agreement
seeking to slow the number of
people coming from the United
States to Canada.
>> The agreement came into
force in 2004 and it was
controversial even then.
>> The reasons why something
like the safe Third Country
agreement may have appealed to
policy makers and politicians
was because of concerns about
the overwhelming of Canada's
asylum system.
The number of arrivals
in Canada is fairly minor
compared to that of a
major refugee accepting states.
It really is premised on the
idea that refugees can get fair
and equal treatment and access
to protection in both countries
which signed that agreement,
which is to say, Canada and the
United States.
>> If either countries were to
become hostile to refugees,
it would defeat the principle
of the agreement entirely.
That's what some refugee
groups are saying is happening
right now under Trump.
>> Canada and the United States
have very different refugee
determination systems,
and we're really seeing
the acceleration of this under
the Trump administration.
But not only the United States
cannot genuinely be
considered a safe country
for refugees.
Their level of protections
are much lower.
They have many more
barriers to becoming a refugee.
And so the US and the Canadian
system are not really that
comparable.
>> The reason why Canada signed
the Refugee Convention was
because it Recognized the moral
imperative to help people in
need, to help people fleeing
their homes because of state
persecution, because of civil
war, because of other drivers
of displacement.
So the flip side
to the idea that Canada
could be overwhelmed is, well,
why aren't we putting more
resources into making sure our
system works better?
>> So how close are we to the
world imagined in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights?
That's the question Alex Neve
grapples with in his new book,
Universal Renewing Human Rights
in a Fractured World.
He's the former secretary
general of Amnesty
International Canada.
I talked to him
about whether this country
is doing enough to promote
human rights globally
and here at home, and why he
thinks the safe third country
agreement needs to go.
To start us off,
when we talk about
universal human rights, are we
all using the same definition?
>> We probably aren't all using
the same definition, but we
absolutely could and should be
using the same definition
because there is one mount to
look to, and that is, and many
people will have heard of it.
The Universal Declaration of
Human Rights.
Takes us back to 1948
at the United Nations.
And think about that moment
in history.
It's a pretty raw,
turbulent, fearful time.
We've just been through
the carnage of World War II.
Were trying to understand
and cope with the absolute,
utter horror of the Holocaust,
and governments come together.
First, they create
and establish the United
Nations, and in that, amongst
other things, set protecting
and respecting human rights as
one of the primary purposes of
this new world body that had
never been done globally before.
And then a few years later, in
1948, drafted and adopted the
Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.
And I think it is, as
we intuitively would imagine,
the word universal means.
And that is it's something
for it's something for you
and for me.
It's something for all of us,
for everyone, everywhere.
And no matter what,
at all times.
That's the sense of
universality, that it's
something transcendent,
that that extends to everyone
and everywhere and and always
matters.
>> In your book, you write that
this isn't universality.
Finest hour.
Why do you say that?
>> And every time I say that,
everyone just generally nods
their head.
I think I think people
understand that we have
this broken, fractured world
around us.
Certainly the mass atrocities
that that seem to be
picking up pace, and we've got
genocide unfolding in Gaza.
We've got Russia's invasion,
illegal, unlawful invasion of
Ukraine.
We have a devastating
humanitarian and human rights
crisis in the midst of civil
war in Sudan.
And then there's
Afghanistan and there's the
Rohingya crisis, and there's
Venezuela.
And on and on goes the list.
We've got the climate crisis,
which I think that sense of
this not being universality
is finest.
Hour could not be more
urgent when we think of
the climate crisis,
because here we've got
something that is actually
challenging our very survival,
our planet's very survival.
We've got the rise of hate,
hate, disinformation, lies,
divisiveness, polarisation, and
it permeates our politics.
It permeates society.
I think in many respects
it feels like we're becoming
fearful of one another.
We don't know how to
talk to one another.
Where does
that leave us when it comes to
something like universality?
And the list can go on, but
that's just a sense of how
fractured this world is right
now.
>> Alex, you were the secretary
general of Amnesty International
Canada for 20 years.
How would you respond to
those who are at the moment
with the examples that you've
given, are quite sceptical of
how much human rights
organisations can actually move
the needle?
>> First, I would say that that
everyone who has their doubts
has every reason to be doubtful
and sceptical.
Just look around us.
Of course we have.
We have so much human rights
challenge and crisis
in our world.
Why wouldn't all of us,
including those of us who are
human rights activists,
be filled up with that?
I would certainly want
people to be assured, and
maybe let's use 1948 to now as
our as our kind of time span.
There has been enormous
progress.
I mean, we're focusing on
this fractured, deteriorating
world and the collapse of
the international rules
based order, etc.,
but from 1948 to 2025,
there has been immense
human rights change
in our world everywhere.
And we can't protect that even
to, to to start with something
like the equality rights of
women, to imagine where we were
everywhere, certainly here in
Canada in 1948 compared to 2025,
the equality rights of the to
LGBTQ plus community, there's
enormous progress that has
enshrined human rights
meaningfully and constitutions
and laws, all of that progress,
always important to note,
has come from the people,
from communities, from struggle,
from rights holders who have
have pushed the the dial
and the needle.
The reason that we still have
this sense of failure
is we've not truly embraced
what universality is
all about.
It's the first word
in that declaration, Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
It was really supposed to be
all about that.
But we have not embraced
a sense of universality
in our world.
And I and I'm not just
pointing my finger at,
you know, the governments
and corporations
and power elites when I say
that, I am pointing my finger
there, but I'm not only
pointing my finger there.
This is about all of us
in various different ways.
We've gone along.
Maybe we've even very
deliberately in our own lives,
made choices and decisions
where we have excluded, where
we have looked away from the
rights of others.
And that is what number one
has to shift.
But number two can shift, and
it can shift for perhaps one
very fundamental reason.
It speaks to something
that is innate in all of us,
even in a world of violence
and cruelty and exploitation,
we all also have a sense of
common humanity.
>> I want to put a little focus
on us here as a nation.
Canada.
We have a lot of discussions at
TVO over the years about
Canada's place in the world.
There's been a growing
sentiment that Canada, as a
middle power, fails to punch
above its weight.
If you were to grade us,
how are we doing
in human rights?
>> I would give us a C right
now, maybe even a C-minus.
And I say that with
a sense of sadness and dismay,
because there are times
in the past when I would have
given us a B-plus or an A-minus,
because I think Canada has had
some notable contributions
to the world stage.
You think back to
the the late '90s, early 2000,
for instance, when Canada led
in banning landmines, in
protecting child soldiers, in
establishing the International
Criminal Court.
You know, huge breakthroughs
that the legacy of which
are still with us today.
But you really have to
look that far back.
That's what, 25-plus years now
for those golden moments.
And so, yes, we are now
punching if maybe back
in in those days we were
punching a bit above our weight,
I would say we're now punching
below our weight.
I'm hard pressed to point
to something that Canada
is bringing to the world stage
when it comes to human rights,
that we should all feel
a sense of pride about.
We're there, we're in
discussions.
You know, we we vote
the right way on numbers
of resolutions at the United
Nations.
Not always.
We're not leading the charge.
We're not using our political
and diplomatic capital
to advance, you know,
a bold new human rights
initiative at a time when we are
desperately in need of such.
And and we can be that
we have been that in the past.
And there are other countries,
countries that don't have the
heft and influence that Canada
does.
You know, people talk a
lot about what Norway does in
sort of global human rights and
humanitarian spaces with, I
don't know, about a 10th the
population of Canada, Ireland,
Spain.
You know, a lot of people
have been noticing the courage
and conviction of of
those countries and others, for
instance, in speaking out about
genocide in Gaza, for instance,
whereas we get timid and tie
ourselves up in knots, won't
use the language.
We abstain from resolutions
rather than supporting them.
That's not good enough.
It's never been good enough.
But right now,
when universality is so frayed
and needs not just support but
champions, Canada needs to be
there.
>> I want to talk relations.
Canada has been doing a lot of
re-examining about our
relationship with our
neighbours to the South.
Is there an opportunity
for us to get back to
those early days?
Perhaps chart our own course
on human rights?
>> So obviously with the Trump
administration, we do not have
a partner when it comes to
human rights.
Quite the opposite.
We have a longtime ally
that is now perhaps in
many ways more than any other
country in the world,
contributing to the decimation
of this notion that the human
rights promise is universal, is
stripping it away from millions
of people within the United
States, and is and is
eviscerating the universal
human rights promise on the
world stage.
And we're staying silent
in the face of most of that.
We're obviously very
preoccupied with our economic
relationship, and I do not,
you know, underestimate that.
I know how significant and
important that is.
This is, of course,
that moment where we're
needing to reach out to other
partners, new partners around
the world, not just to increase
our trade relationship with
them, but to jointly reach out
and say, how do we come
together to make sure that we
are a bulwark for the universal
human rights promise at a time
when it's coming undone?
>> Something that you talk
about safe third country
agreement for people who aren't
familiar with that, what is
that and why is that something
that you say needs to go?
>> So the safe Third Country
Agreement deals with refugee
protection, and it's an
agreement that Canada and the
United States entered into over
20 years ago.
And it's had various different
phases to it, but essentially
it has more or less shut down
access to refugee protection
in Canada for refugees
who pass through
the United States and then try
to cross the Canada-US land
border to be able to make
a refugee claim here.
The agreement's premise is that
Canada and the US both have
refugee protection systems that
meet international standards.
I've always disagreed with that
when it comes to the United
States long before Donald Trump,
but nonetheless, that's the
premise such that in order for
there to be a responsible,
equitable, equitable approach
to refugee protection, refugees
should be expected to make
their claim in the first
country that they pass through.
There have been many, many
problematic chapters, you know,
even under George Bush, even
under Barack Obama, even under
Joe Biden, when it comes to
refugee protection in the
United States.
And whether it truly does
meet those international
standards.
But now we're in a stage where
essentially there's no other
way to say it.
Donald Trump has declared
a full-out war on the rights
of refugees and migrants
in the United States,
and we stay silent.
We do not raise a whisper
of concern about what
is happening to to refugees and
migrants in the United States,
and we continue to maintain the
line officially.
Cabinet ministers say this to
journalists that the
fundamentals of refugee
protection in the United States
are still in place.
Therefore, there is no need to
revisit, let alone to scrap,
this agreement.
That is unconscionable.
It is.
It is, I think, in my mind,
the most obvious example of
where we could take
an immediate step that
at least demonstrates that
we have some backbone when it
comes to human rights in this
very troubling time.
But we're staying silent.
That's a disgrace.
>> Closer to home, there are
calls on the government of
Ontario to withdraw Bill five,
the Protect Ontario by
Unleashing Our Economy Act.
Where do we begin or start with
something like that?
>> So I'll just name two issues
in particular that I think have
a real Ontario specific
resonance.
Absolutely.
Bill 5.
And and with that more
broadly, are still absolutely
lacklustre.
Would be generous
but problematic approach to
where we situate the rights of
indigenous peoples in our
decision making, in our
lawmaking, in our in our
resource development, in our
investment decisions.
And Bill 5 is a perfect example
of that.
Federally, we have at least
taken the step of of adopting
the UN declaration on
the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples into federal law that
has happened provincially in
one province in British
Columbia.
Ontario should take that step
as well to bring that
instrument domestically,
directly into Ontario's
provincial laws, and then
ensure that things like Bill
5 bill are being are being
governed by that.
That absolutely would be
a crucial thing to do.
Another issue that
I want to highlight is is
homelessness, which is in every
way imaginable a human rights
issue.
You know, from the very
beginning, international human
rights norms, the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights
talks about the essential right
to adequate housing.
We obviously are falling
dramatically short everywhere
across Canada and around the
world, in fact, but very much
so in Ontario.
And one of the places
this comes up in a very
direct way around human rights
protection is, is how we handle
the issue of of people living
in homeless encampments.
And one of the things
that's been so troubling
to hear from Premier Ford's
government and from
a number of municipal
governments across the province,
is their willingness to just
completely run roughshod over
the rights of homeless people
living in encampments by using
the notorious notwithstanding
clause in the Charter of Rights,
which is essentially the the
get out of jail free card for
governments when it comes to
human rights violations.
Those are the kinds of things
we need to change.
>> All right, Alex, what are
three concrete actions
Canadians can take right now to
advocate for better universal
human rights.
>> At the federal level?
It is absolutely time to scrap
the disgraceful,
safe third country agreement
that we maintain with
the United States that is built
on the fiction, that somehow
all is okay for refugees and
migrants in the United States
right now.
Secondly, here in Ontario,
withdraw Bill 5,
which is an assault on the
rights of indigenous peoples in
this country, in this province,
and and simply should not go
forward as law.
And then, number three,
I think this is very concrete.
Have a conversation today
with a friend, a co-worker,
a neighbour, a stranger
on the bus and mention
universal human rights.
Ask a question about
universal human rights.
Make it clear to someone
that you care about
universal human rights
and encourage them
to do the same.
>> Alex, we're going to leave
it there.
Thank you so much for
giving us hope.
>> Thanks very much.
I enjoyed the conversation.
>> We are building this show
for you and we want you
to build it with us.
What do you like or not like
about what we're doing so far?
