By the way, I don't have a psychosis.
I have a Claude complex.
Why is everyone making that joke? Wait.
Which joke? The psychosis joke.
I thought you were going to be proud of me
for saying Claude Complex.
Oh, that is very good.
I think I do one pun finally for Tracy,
and I was over making that joke.
Well, I was thinking that was a joke.
I had to go.
I finally make a pun,
and you just jump right over it.
Well, everyone keeps saying
that Claude code is I psychosis for smart
people, right? Like,
how did that become addictive?
Yeah. All right.
But there's a good. Fun
also very bro coded.
I find.
Hello and
welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots
podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal
And I'm Tracy
Alloway. So, Tracy you're cool.
Like, if I like,
you know, just
start doing this part time as I like,
build out my software business.
Right. Like you're cool about that.
I was going to say I've been thinking
about AI and productivity.
And so far
your productivity has gone down, Joe.
So instead of doing all thoughts things,
you're coding your own software.
Except that I'm creating content
for the Odd Lots
newsletter about coding
and that is productivity.
A creative.
Debatable. Debatable.
But but you're cool with that.
You're cool with like me.
Like, oh,
I'm just going to, like, check in part
time on Odd Lots when we have a record.
Well, oh. Of course not.
Okay, good, good, good.
That's the right answer. I want you to.
I want you to be really sad.
But like a few other people, you know,
I have, like,
caught the sort of, like, bug of, like,
AI coding, and I'm totally blown away.
I like, played with it from the beginning.
I started playing around with it
last year, but then over the holidays
and I've been writing about this
in the newsletter suddenly, like,
my Twitter feed is like club code, plug
code, plug code
and you just cursor before
which I was very impressed by at the time.
And so when I got home from vacation,
one of the first things I did
is like, figure out
how to install plug code on my computer.
And I was like, oh, I am like hooked.
And this is actually like,
I see why I have my Twitter feed
is just like people posting about this.
All right.
So I have to say,
I have not tried it because I only have
a work computer
and I can't install new software.
And I probably definitely cannot install
new software that then makes changes
to existing software.
I don't think Bloomberg would like that.
But I have seen the hype.
Lots of people talking about it.
Have you seen, Claude Co-work?
Have you heard of. Oh, yeah. Yeah,
yeah, yeah.
So one of the criticisms of Claude Code
was that, you know, like, okay, you code,
but you still need some background
knowledge and coding because,
like, you know,
the interface is kind of like.
Is. And, and all of that or 1990s, co-work
apparently, like, goes
a step further for, for normal people,
including it makes it super, super easy.
And the funniest thing is that apparently
Claude code actually coded.
Yeah.
So the so this is like really relates
to my experience last year
and then this year,
which is that even last year,
like trying to use the AI coding tools,
it was an annoying process
because there were various things
that you had to do in the actual command
line of the computer
that were like, I didn't,
I don't know, command line vernacular.
And you have to like
install these libraries and stuff.
Yeah.
So there was this sort of like barrier
that existed and
but what's the
what's really changed in the last year
or with the, with Claude code,
which has actually been around for a while
and I should have like played with it
before is the like
because it sits on your computer.
It's sort of takes away in deeper access
and so when you talk about.
It, it actually does the stuff.
It does.
Is it just like,
oh, it's like, oh, we're
going to need to install this open source
natural language processing library.
It just does it automatically.
Instead of me trying to like figure out
like what are the right keystrokes
to pull that in or
why is this not going into the right file
folder or whatever.
And so like, like Co-work,
it's like all, like all of these sort
of like little friction,
like these technical things like command
line use are very rapidly
are like dissipating.
Yeah.
And so that like then
you have something like Co-work
where it's just like they know
they're taking care of that.
And so you get this like user interface
that's just like
it's just getting easier and friendlier.
There's almost no technical frictions
at all anymore.
Also, it feels very iterative,
like the code is improving upon itself.
Yeah.
At this point I think that was
one of Claude's main selling points.
Well, this is like you've seen like people
talk about like, oh, is AGI here?
And this is like part of the debate
because one of the ideas, I guess, behind
AGI is like, well,
what happens when you have software
that can train itself and so forth?
And I don't really know if I buy that,
but you do just see, like how fast
the iteration cycles are.
And I think
we want to get into this in part,
they're fast because a bunch of people
are suddenly getting excited,
and then the human provides
this sort of like
we're sowing the seeds of our own demise
because we're so enthusiastically
participating in the evolution.
But I just like it's suddenly clear, like,
oh, this is going to change.
I think computing.
And the other thing is the code works
like it creates code that like
this is like
there's no bugs. You know, it works.
Did you
see speaking of automating yourself?
Yeah.
See there was a post on Reddit
from a lawyer who said he's basically used
cloud code to automate, like,
his entire job, and he hasn't told anyone.
I'm not exactly surprised, because
the other thing that I experimented with
is, and I haven't 100% verified this,
but on jobs day last week,
I downloaded the full PDF
and I just typed into the cloud code
like find the most interesting details
and make some charts based on.
And it did it in like a couple of minutes.
I have no like, ability.
Like I've never like built charts myself
and or whatever, or like designer
or whatever.
And I didn't totally confirm yet
that the data was all correct,
but I'm pretty sure it was
because everything I spot, so I didn't.
Just that crucial. Detail,
I know I didn't.
That's why I didn't want to like,
oh, like, here's what, here's the here's
jobs report and charts.
But it might.
But what application did
it actually build it in the charts?
I don't know.
I just had a like that's the thing.
I had a file on my computer at that
point. What kind of file?
Like a PNG file.
Like an image file?
Yeah, that's the crazy thing,
I don't know.
And so there was just this image
that had a bunch of charts, and my spark
chunks did suggest, like,
I didn't see anything off.
And people get paid money
to, like, build that kind of stuff
for, like,
analysts and stuff like that. Right.
So this is the other big question.
If everyone can build their own software,
what actually happens to software?
And I was reading something.
I forget who it was by,
but someone used cloud code to create.
They wanted a website that would basically
make them money for doing nothing.
And that was the prompt.
And did they do? Yeah.
So the idea that,
the model came up with was
you can sell
prompts, packages of good prompts
and sell them for like 40 bucks
and you'll make tons of money.
And I was thinking about that, like, okay,
it's possible to make money that way.
But also,
why wouldn't I just use cloud code. To.
Do the same thing?
There are many big questions
that we as an economy
are going to have to think about.
And I think my main takeaway
is we're going to have to
think about this sooner rather than later.
But what is cloud code?
Why is everyone so hyped about it?
And what is it about this
particular piece of software that versus
what exists from OpenAI and Gemini
and all this stuff?
Like, why is this captured
everyone's imagination?
We really do have the perfect guys
because it's someone who, unlike me,
has been getting their hands dirty
and this stuff for longer.
One of the few people that I know
who is into LMS before ChatGPT existed
and was actually using them via
the API, and was actually talking about
their technical capacity to do things
like coding even before November of 2022.
So truly the perfect guys we're going
to be speaking with Noah Brier.
He's the co-founder of L'échec,
a consultancy that helps big companies
deal with AI stuff.
So, Noah, thank you so much for coming
on, and let's thank.
You for having. Me. What's the deal?
How are you like using lemons
before chat, GPT existed?
I don't know, I know
very few people who were doing that.
I had the good fortune
of shutting down a startup in 2022,
and so I had a lot of free time
on my hands.
And then how are you using it, though?
Like how do you look at your like,
how did you aware
that there was this thing
that could be of potential use to.
So my very first thing I was doing
was using GitHub copilot,
which at the time was built into VS code
and it was autocomplete inside VS code.
So it was a nice and pretty immediately
realized that there were certain
coding tasks
that it could just handle completely.
Anything that was very pattern based.
So if you write code,
you write a lot of tests.
If you write tests, every test
kind of follows the same pattern
and you want it to follow
the same pattern, you're
looking for that structure
in and over time,
because it was looking at your code base,
it was able to basically autocomplete it.
I also started playing with the GPT
three API,
which had come out,
I think that came out in November of 2021,
and that was the first time
it was publicly available to everybody.
And they had a large language model
as we know it today, available to them.
So I was just testing and building things,
and I pretty immediately
realized the very first thing I did
where it just blew my mind,
was I built a web scraper.
So I was I was just trying
to pull pricing data from a website.
And I've done a lot of this in my career.
It's maybe the most annoying task
you have to do in all of coding,
because HTML is the most miserable
language to have to parse.
And I just had this thing
where I took the page, I took the content,
I took the text, and I gave it to the AI,
and I asked it to give me back
the pricing table, and it gave me back
the pricing table.
And I just thought,
I'll never do it the other way again.
That's is that HTML mentioned?
Just brought up like memories of me
in like the mid-nineties on HTML.
Good. Easy to remember that site.
Yeah.
I wonder if it's still is it still up?
That would be wild.
Does clawed code?
Does that count as AGI?
This seems to be the debate right?
Is it AGI?
I try not to wade into what's AGI
and what's not.
I think my guess on on AGI,
for what it's worth, is that
it's probably going to be a conversation
like the Turing test,
where everybody thought it was really,
really important.
For a really long time,
we thought the Turing test
was the biggest thing for 70 years
or whatever.
And then.
ChatGPT
very clearly passed the Turing test,
and now everybody pretends like it's
just that they forgot.
They pretend that it never mattered.
Oh, and so I am kind of
guessing that that's going to be
what the conversation is like.
It's just going to be a sort of forever
moving goalpost.
Because it turns out that the idea we had
for what
general intelligence looks like
is not quite that.
But I also think, you know, the computer
scientists and the sort of serious
AI researchers would say that
much of what's going on inside cloud
code is not the model itself,
it's the model paired with a human.
And I think that is
a pretty important distinction.
But I don't know about AGI.
Well, okay, so you were using, GPT to code
prior to the release of ChatGPT.
So therefore coding models
have been around a long time.
So what is for those who haven't played
or played around with it.
What is Claude code?
Because again, coding models
have been around for a long time.
If people maybe have heard of cursor
Copilot
or some of these other harnesses, etc.,
what is cloud code?
So if we back up first
and we go to copilot because so copilot
was the first sort of commercial
application of a large language model.
By most accounts.
And what copilot did in its initial
instantiation was just.
Auto some Microsoft. Product.
It's a Microsoft product.
So Microsoft owns GitHub, GitHub
developer Copilot.
It was Microsoft
had the partnership with OpenAI.
And so they built it in and what it was
doing was doing autocomplete.
So if you're writing code,
a lot of writing code is boilerplate or
trying to remember the name of a function.
And, you know, the reason
StackOverflow existed
was because you can never remember
the exact name of that function or,
or the exact regex that you need to use
in order to find and replace something.
And so you would go search for it.
And they realized that you could just
build that into the IDE,
your code editor and,
and have it autocomplete for you.
And it was pretty amazing. Yeah.
Then,
ChatGPT came out, and even before that,
I had built a simple chat bot for myself
because I realized that, hey,
I could just ask this and instead of going
and searching StackOverflow,
it was totally capable
of answering code questions,
and it was capable of writing regex
or doing these things.
And did it make mistakes? Yes.
But like there's famous mistakes
on StackOverflow of incorrect regex
that now exists
in every codebase in the world.
And so, you know, there were a lot of us
just kind of playing with these things
and realizing they were a huge boon.
And so I think really
the next step is Curser comes out.
And the thing is to realize that copilot
didn't was that it wasn't good enough
to have autocomplete.
You also needed the Q&A
because you have these things
that you can't just autocomplete.
You want to be able to ask the question
and answer it.
And then ChatGPT came out
and everybody was switching between idea.
And then I think really the next big piece
is that cloud code came out,
and what Cloud Code did
that was so remarkable
was they took
the same set of models, really.
And they took them out of the chat bot
and they really just gave it
some very basic functionality
to operate within your machine.
Right.
And so, you know, if you really look
at kind of what exists within cloud code,
you're calling out to a model
and they gave it capability around
sort of two big things.
One is you can read
and write files on your computer.
And then two is that you can operate Unix.
The, the base commands, the bash commands
that exist in your environment.
And again, because
these models were trained on the internet
and there's no greater
source of information
on the internet
than how to make the internet,
they know how to use Unix commands
incredibly well.
Right? Because Unix has existed
for whatever it is 60 years.
And the way these commands were designed,
they're all designed to be very,
very simple.
There's a find command
and, you know, there's a thing called grep
and it can search to a code base.
And Unix has this sort of beautiful way
of tying one command to another
so you can take the output of one command
and send it to another.
And they kind of just gave the model
access to these 2 or 3 very simple things.
And it kind of turned out that it unlocked
a whole bunch of functionality
that I don't think even the people
who built it fully realized.
Like one example that I think about a lot
is just the challenge
you have with all of these
AI models is that they're stateless.
So every time you talk to ChatGPT, it's
sending your entire conversation history
back to ChatGPT because it has no saved
history of that chat.
Right?
And that's fine. It's the way it works.
It just fact, but it means that,
you know, it forgets things.
It doesn't know conversation,
a conversation and one
very easy way to save
your state is just write it to a file.
And so
you give it right access
and it can create files.
And now all of a sudden
you've overcome this like probably
the single biggest challenge
that exists inside these large
language models, which is that
they're fundamentally stateless.
So Claude writes itself
little like memory notes, right,
to to remember
the entire context of the conversation.
And that's how it solved that problem.
No. So there's sort of two things
going on in cloud code beneath the hood.
There's one thing that works exactly
like ChatGPT or any of these other ones,
which is it's maintaining
a conversation history.
So every message you send it and every,
action, it takes, it's recording to a log.
Right.
Which is just one big file that's really
no different than what ChatGPT can do.
Where it gets really interesting,
though, is it can also write files
that it can then read.
So whereas that conversation
history is all saved off
and eventually
that conversation gets too long
and it needs to do a thing
called compaction.
And when it compacts it,
it tries to sort of just remember the bits
because there the total window is, is, is
large.
But I mean, it's like 100,000 tokens.
So that's what I mean by memory
notes. Right?
It compacts the information
into the important stuff.
So it doesn't retrieve. It does that.
It only does that at the end.
Like once it runs out of space, okay.
Once it runs out of context window.
So it has 200,000 tokens,
I think, and 200,000 tokens in rough
terms is probably 150,000 words.
It says, okay, it's
time for me to compact all of this stuff.
And so it still saves your whole history
on your computer.
You still have the entire message.
But for that session, it just compacts it
down to this, you know,
maybe 25,000 token memory. 25.
What it was. Yeah.
And is this,
like something that was not obvious
before as a solution like this compaction.
How important is it for this being like,
okay, as a human, I can work on this
on a project for a long time.
Like how much of an unlock was there?
I'm not sure compaction was the okay.
I think the compaction
functionality is helpful.
Okay.
The way ChatGPT does it for
what it's worth is
they don't do compaction,
they just forget your messages eventually.
So if you're in one chat,
eventually your oldest message is going
to fall off the back.
For coding,
that's probably less helpful,
but there are trade offs.
I have both techniques work.
I think fundamentally
the thing that is special about cloud
code is not the compaction,
it's the it's the ability
to write and read files on your computer.
Yeah. Which means
you can always write off memories.
And then what does that mean?
Right off memory.
So you could say, hey,
I it's really important that
I remember this thing for future sessions.
I want to always work this way.
So in a code base of mine,
I have a set of documentation
that explains how I like to do things,
and cloud code makes a mistake.
And so the next time
I can write a memory, essentially
it's written as a thing they call a skill.
And you can write it off and you say, hey,
whenever you run into this,
I want you to operate in this kind of way.
And that existing across every session
is really a thing you can only do
when you can store it as a file.
Yeah, it's a thing you can't do in
quite the same way when you're
operating in this environment where it's
just going back and forth to the API.
So this access to the file system
is one really big piece.
And then the second is,
is just the Unix commands, I mean
computers, every computer program
lives
on top of the sort of baseline functions.
And the way that the designers of Unix
built them is really elegant
and they're very small.
They all do one thing
and they're all composable.
And in
coding terms, composable means they can be
they can be chained together.
Right.
And so you can say, hey,
look for files that mention this word
and then from those files,
I want you to take this second action.
And then from the output of that action,
I want you to take a third action.
And that's just built into Unix.
You literally
just put a little pipe in between
and you just pipe them from one to another
and, and that's it.
And so
you give it access
to write these commands,
and all of a sudden
it gets these sort of second and third
order effects
that are just incredibly powerful
and built over a really long time.
So how much of Claude code,
the way it's different to other models,
how much of that was overcoming
technological challenges versus
like just having a good idea
because hearing you describe it,
I mean, giving access to a computer
seems like kind of obvious.
Like, let's, let's just do that.
I don't have a good answer to that.
I think that it was kind of
just a good idea.
Yeah. I think they did some patterns
really well.
They're clearly incredibly talented,
not just engineers, but kind of thinkers
about how to structure it.
Like, the, the primitives inside
called code are just smart.
And then the thing that they've done
and Boris Cherny, who's the,
lead developer on cloud coded anthropic,
he talks about, latent demand a lot.
Right.
And latent demand is basically just,
hey, look at the ways people are using
these systems and then figure out ways
to make that a part of the product itself.
I think what they've done brilliantly,
and this is kind of easy when you have
a community of developers who are nerds,
who want to go talk about all the ways
that they're using these things,
is they have.
I am amazed at the speed in which,
you know, I have a small community
of 15 CTOs
who all use this stuff religiously.
And, you know,
when we first started that community,
it took them a month to
I would see it in the chat,
and then a month later,
it would get built into cloud code.
And then increasingly like
it's like a day later,
it feels like they're just
they're just listening to it.
But I think they're just not only tapped
in, but they're really fundamentally,
you know, they're they're dog fooding.
They use their own products
when you, you know,
they talk about the productivity
engineering, productivity at anthropic.
You know, despite growing at a crazy clip,
it continues to go up.
And, you know, anybody who's built
had to manage large scale
pieces of software, large scale
codebases knows that's not the norm.
So vs code and cursor, these are ideas.
Cloud code is not an ID, it's a CLI.
A clear command line interface.
Got it.
And the other labs
now they also have close.
So why are we all talk about cloud code
and AI charging.
Because users are called Codex.
I don't know what Gemini's is called.
I think it's just called the gem.
Okay, so.
Why are we all talk about cloud code
rather than the other classes
that kind of have the same thing?
Like what is the difference?
I think first and foremost
they were first.
Okay. So and I think they've
they've had a lot more.
And you know, from
my very personal opinion, I think they've
done some things smarter and better
as far as the Permissioning models.
So, you know, one of the really dangerous
things is you've got this thing
running on your computer.
You don't want it to go
and delete everything.
Right?
And, they have a very fine grained
permissioning model
where you can say, hey,
I want to allow this just this one time.
I want to always allow it.
You know. I always click, always allow.
I living on the edge.
You can, you can, next time you run it,
you can just do a flag
that says dangerously skip permissions.
And and it'll
just, they call it yolo mode.
I think
I think more fundamentally, though,
if I look at at Codex versus Cloud Code,
I think it's, a difference
in philosophy around what you want.
AI to do.
To me, Codex,
which is excellent, is very focused on
building an agent that you can just
give something to and it'll just go do it.
So I want to give it that task.
I don't want to intercede.
I don't want to give it any more feedback.
And cloud code
is much more designed
to be, kind of a pair programmer.
And so, you know, in engineering,
pair programing has existed for a while.
It's a really weird
sort of productivity thing
where you put two engineers
on the same problem and it turns out
that you can get better code and worse,
multiply.
Yeah.
And it sort of makes up for the fact
that obviously, you know, you're
doubling the staff on it,
but because of how many fewer bugs
because you have both sets of eyes, it
it has seemed to work out for many folks.
Most companies don't practice it.
But I think cloud code fundamentally
is much more designed in that way.
It's a pair programmer.
It's, they, you know, whenever
I start a project, I start in plan mode.
So you start in plan mode,
you put together a plan.
I really I mean,
I spend a lot of time in plan mode.
You go through you,
it gives you a plan back.
It asks you how you feel.
You can give it
a whole bunch of direction,
and then it's only then that it goes off
and it goes into it.
So, you know, we're working together
and I actually have a whole system now
that I've designed where,
I use
a task management system called linear.
So I have quad code
write tasks off to linear.
And then I've worked, with cloud code
to write a document that helps
sort of decide
a set of heuristics to decide
when you should assign it to Codex versus
when you should give it to cloud code.
And so if it's tightly defined enough
and simple enough,
I just send it off to Codex.
And it does it totally independently.
And then if it's complicated enough
that I think it requires
my time and attention, then it
it saves it for me, us to do together.
And we'll work on it together.
And so if it's, it's sort of touching,
kind of important enough if it's changing
some part of the data model,
there's these other kind of,
you know, fairly
basic set of criteria that I use. And,
but that
to me is the fundamental distinction.
And, you know, I find cloud code
in that way to be just in it
sort of fits what I want to do
and how I want to work.
Much better.
Talk a little bit more
about how it actually impacts the workflow
of an engineer, because, you know,
my impression was people can code, right?
Like the coding problem
is kind of solved at this point.
And even if you can't code, even
if you're not a professional engineer,
you can hire someone from like India
or Indonesia
or wherever to just write you a code.
Maybe it'll take them a week
instead of like two days with cloud code.
But how much does this actually change
the workflow for an engineer?
As completely as it could be changed.
I mean, I would say that over
the last three months
I've written personally,
I don't know, a few hundred lines of code,
like, I, I am mostly
a manager of a set of agents
who are writing code on my behalf.
And, you know, increasingly,
what I think is interesting,
I've been thinking about
this bunch lately is like,
in some ways, it's just bringing me back
to the core challenge
that has always existed in software
development, which is how do you manage,
large scale software development projects?
Coordination. Right.
It has become a coordination problem.
And, and I spent a lot of time sort of now
designing
my cloud code system
to ensure that code goes through
all the proper checks
and that it it has all these things.
The other thing that, you know, makes code
a particularly good place to do this
is that code is verifiable in a way
that, you know, most other work is not.
So, you know, with code, you can verify
that the build works, right?
So you can say, hey, I want to build this,
I want to build this package.
I want to make sure
that it's actually going to build
and that there's not going to be
no failures.
That's a very easy check. It's
either true or it's not true.
There's also coders use linting.
And so linting is a way to kind of
look it's static code analysis.
So it basically tries to sort of find,
things in your code base
that are not going to work ahead of time,
where you can predict that obviously,
you can't predict, Alan Turing, proved
that you can't predict, with certainty
whether code is going to run.
But there are certain patterns
and things that it can find.
It's essentially does static pattern
analysis.
And, so, you know,
you haven't run all these things, but,
the more kind of opinionated
you can be about that
and the more steps
you can have a go through.
So I find, you know,
now I'm kind of the designer,
which honestly, as an entrepreneur
and as a CEO of companies
like that's kind of always been my job.
Like I've been up not I have less and less
been a person who writes code.
And more and more
I've been a person who designs
a system, in that case, a company
with a bunch of people who write code.
One of the funny things it
seems to me
is that setting aside clawed code
code itself has a reputation for.
It's a nicer chat bot to talk to people,
find it,
you know, ChatGPT
seems to really be sycophantic.
I still think it's.
I know it's improved, but I actually don't
think it's improved enough.
It's still.
People like the prose style of,
claw clawed.
And I'm curious
that in the pair trading, pair trading,
I'm thinking about finance, the peer
engineering model,
whether there is also an edge there,
which is like here is a chat bot
that is not annoying to talk
to while you're iterating,
and whether that is like a meaningful
distinction between,
you know, coding with Codex or whatever.
Yeah, I, I don't know, I it still can be
very annoying, I can tell you.
And it'll still sometimes, be overly,
overly
effusive with me about a design choice
I made or sort of noticed something,
which I could live without.
I so I'm working on this project
that's, doing this linguistic things,
and I eventually had to say, like,
give it to me straight.
How bad is this?
And then so I said, I said, actually,
what I said was and assume
for a moment that you are
a quantitative linguistics for the PhD.
Give me your honest assessment
of where we are with this.
And it said, like you've developed
a nice toy and there's no evidence
that it actually does.
And I was like, okay, that's nice to hear.
I actually like I,
you know, I appreciate that.
And it was like a very blunt,
no, you know, it's still like polite,
but it was like, this does it
you do have a really showing anything
you haven't really established at all
that your software does what it claims to.
Yeah, I think so.
I think stylistically
I kind of personally agree.
I my theory,
by the way on on Claude versus
OpenAI ChatGPT models is
I think Claude is actually better
at sort of reflecting what you give it.
And so I think part of why we think
it's better is it
it's better at pretending it's us.
Yeah.
And so we tend to like that is
this is purely, speculation.
But that's always been my theory on.
On to flatters you in a different. Way.
I think it's flattering you in a much.
More subtle way. Yeah. Interesting.
But, for a long time, just,
anthropic has been producing
the best coding models, you know?
I mean, there's
there can be some debate there now, but,
you know, there's a great story
from cursor, actually,
where cursor basically wasn't that good.
And then sonnet 3.5 came out
and all of a sudden
cursor was amazing and cursor became
a tool that everybody started using.
But it wasn't
until this other model came out
and they made that the default model.
And, you know, I for what it's worth,
I think the other takeaway from that,
which is a kind of big theme
we see in the market, is the thing that,
the Cloud Code team has talked about is,
you just constantly
have to be building ahead with AI in a way
that is very unique
in the world of software,
where you kind of always want to build
things that are working at like 70 or 80%,
because if you really spend the time
to get it up to 90 or 100,
you're going to lose all the gains you get
when the next model comes out.
And the, you know, with the amount
of CapEx being spent at these models,
like there's a next model
that's going to come out,
that's going to be awesome,
and you just kind of
want to be downstream from that,
and you don't want to waste six months
getting an extra 3% when that new model
is going to give you an extra seven.
Yeah.
This is the only certainty with
AI is like, there's always going to be
a new model.
It's the worst model ever used
is the one that we're using.
That's right, that's right.
Are we all going
to become coding illiterate?
Are we just going to forget how to code
if everyone's using, you know,
general language. To forget
I never learned.
Yeah, okay. You know what
I've been thinking about? You know that,
Scott Karp, the, CEO of Palantir.
He has that line. He's like,
when I was young,
I was too poor to have a car or so
I didn't get a.
So I never learned to drive.
And now I'm too rich.
So I never learned to drive.
I feel like when I was young,
I was too dumb to learn to code.
And now. You leaped. Ahead.
Yeah.
No, I'm too smart to learn Python
or HTML or whatever.
I have a couple of takes on this one
personally.
So, the first one is I just think like
this is the worry of all technology ever.
There was a paper that came out
that showed that people were,
you know, they were forgetting
more things or something
because they were
using ChatGPT. But, you know,
in Phaedrus, Plato was worried
that people were going to forget things
because they started writing things down.
And, you know, I think the trade off
there was pretty good.
We got this scientific revolution,
a couple other things. So,
you know, I think that's
the sort of natural kneejerk.
With that said, it is
I it's very strange when you have people,
you know, the Cloud code team is talking
about how little code they write.
Now, I draw a distinction
in between the sort of vibe coding
and the kind of amateur people
who have never written code.
And I think that is amazing, by the way.
And I think, there's a lot of software
developers who are really mad about that,
because they're, they, they claim
it's for safety reasons or whatever.
But I think fundamentally it's just
they've got people on their turf.
But I think that's incredible.
I mean, my, I, my, my nine year
old, vibe coded a website.
Oh, wow. And, for secrets. Santa.
She's now ten.
She would get mad at me
if I called her nine,
but I think she got it when she was nine.
But, that that's awesome, right?
I don't know, that's amazing.
That's a way for people
to express themselves
in a way that they couldn't before.
You did your your linguistics project.
That's that's fun and interesting.
But yeah, I, I also think the other the,
the thing that's happening
with professional software developers,
when you hear from anthropic
or you know what I'm talking about, it's,
you know,
the code is going through this process
and, you know,
all the code
still gets reviewed by people.
We're not letting it get out the door
if it's not at the same level as human.
And it's just
but what's amazing is I'm, I'm running
five of these sessions at a time.
Right.
And so I've got like,
software being developed in parallel
in a way that is unimaginable.
And, you know, the other thing is just,
now the best software engineers
wrote the least code.
Anyway,
you know, the sort of classic story of,
like,
the difference between a junior developer
and or senior developer is that a junior
developer gets a problem and they sit down
and they put their fingers on the keyboard
and they start writing code.
And, senior developer gets a problem
and sits there for three hours
and tries to figure out
what the best way to solve it is,
and then spends five minutes
writing code to get it done.
True elegance is restraint.
That's what I say.
What are you seeing in the companies
you're working for?
Like, I find it hard to believe,
and I was maybe skeptical of this,
but it feels like right now
we're here with technology.
We're like,
if I were like, companies like,
like I said,
you can build a charts of data
in a way that used to be like
someone would have had to get their hands
dirty or etc.
in the companies that you talk to
is right now this having an effect
on how they think about
what positions they're hiring for
and the skills they're looking for
and so forth.
I think that
it's hard to answer right there.
I think that certainly,
I do think, I personally think
if I look at the sort of layoffs
in the technology industry
over the last couple of years,
I think some part of that is just looking
at the output of these models
and saying, hey,
these models are able to produce it,
you know, the median.
And I have a whole bunch
of sort of middle managers
who are producing at the 65th percentile.
And it's like, I can produce median
for $1.50 per million tokens, or
I can produce 65th percentile for however
many hundreds of thousand dollars a year.
It's a sort of fairly simple trade off.
I think.
So I do think there's
a lot of downstream effects.
I think the other thing that's happening
is, is kind of like middle
management is under threat
because it's the realization that, hey,
like part of what these models
are amazing at is, is,
I think of them as like a fuzzy interface.
They can sort of turn
any data into any other data, right?
You can sort of transform data
from one format to another.
You can take a PDF
and you can turn it into charts. Right.
And there's whole people who exist.
Or, you know,
if you think about what product managers
do, a lot of what product managers do
is they take
how people are using a product
and they try to transform it into a,
format that engineers can
then use to figure out what to do.
And I think a lot of those kind of,
a lot of those pieces that
used to just be kind
of transferring knowledge.
I've always said, Tracy,
I think one of the most important roles
in any organization
is essentially translation work.
And you see it in the newsroom
where it's like, here is a team
specialized in emerging market currencies,
and then they have to like
they have to then tell the senior editors
what they're working on.
But the senior editors who are maybe
more generalist don't really know, like,
why like some sort of like, you know, one.
Yeah.
And Carrie is important
and that a really important role within
any organization is essentially the,
the team that can translate between
the generalist team and the specialist.
Absolutely.
And so I that's an interesting observation
in the sort of engineering
world is like, okay, these are tools
that are in some sense translation tool.
So we talked to
I agree completely by the way,
but we talked about vibe coding.
And Joe has this application, that
I don't think you're looking to monetize.
No, I'm just trying to make it
for the good of the world.
Right. Okay.
When did that become a common,
What did.
But like this opens up massive questions
for software as a service, right.
For SAS.
Because if everyone
can write their own software,
you can replicate anything that's out
there that is currently charging money.
What's going to happen to software?
I think software is pretty screwed.
A lot of it at least.
Not all of it.
You know,
you still, depends on whether you call
that cloud provider software or not.
You know, you still need to run this stuff
somewhere.
And I think there's, there's certain
kinds of software that,
you know, you just don't really want to be
in the business of writing.
You know, I, as someone who's tried
to build a project management
system, I'd really rather.
I don't think anybody
should be in that business.
But I do think
fundamentally, I mean, we see this
every day inside enterprises.
The the sort of build versus buy
pendulum has just swung.
And, you know, I mean, I used to run
a SAS company and we sold to enterprises
and, you know, for a long time that, that
I think that made a lot of sense, right?
Because like, hey,
it just didn't make sense
to try to build this thing on your own.
And so but the price of that was,
you know, won the price, right?
Like,
and it got to be more and more expensive.
The other price was that you were paying
for a lot of stuff you didn't need.
Right?
Because the whole job of building SAS is
you need to generalize problems
and say you build things
that are going to work for everybody,
and that means either
you have to sort of adapt
or you have to build this sort
of very configurable, software.
And I think and
what I see just, you know,
firsthand is that,
inside these organizations,
you can now solve
very specific problems
that are highly valuable.
And not only can you solve them
better than generic software,
but you can actually, in a lot of ways,
do it for less money
because you're trying to tackle
less stuff.
You didn't need the 16
other features you bought it for, the one
that you really, really cared about.
And so, I think that part of it, you know,
I don't like there's,
I definitely think there are pieces
of the software industry
that are going to,
you know, come out the other side.
You're going to
nobody wants to deal with payroll, right?
Like, you know,
somebody, you're still going to buy
some payroll software
and you're still going to have that.
But, you know,
I do think there are a lot of pieces
where the software existed essentially
as a kind of wrapper around a database.
And now you're just going to, you know,
with just the database, you can do that.
And then, you know, the other piece
I'd say here is it's this is not this is
a kind of confluence of circumstances
where it's not just the coding, it's
also the fact that you have AI
to do a whole bunch of work.
So, you know, if we pick on CRM
for a second, right, like, you know.
Salesforce.com.
Salesforce.com, we can, you know,
you look at what the interface of that is.
And essentially it has existed
to get salespeople to take unstructured
data, which is sales meetings,
and turn it into structured data that so
it can be stored in a database
and now you have AI.
And AI is very capable
of taking unstructured data
directly from the source.
So you have people recording meetings
and then it can structured
into any data that you want.
This is one of the very first sort of mind
blowing moments I had was
that I could give it,
Json interface.
I could describe exactly what I wanted
the data structure to be,
and it would give me back that information
in that data structure.
And we've just basically been having
a bunch of humans
do that work for a very long time,
whether it's in CRM
or project management
or any of these other places,
and the ability to just kind of
get rid of that whole thing.
I think it really does bring into question
the value of a lot of these software
companies.
Well,
so we have seen like a lot of software
stocks, they look like melting ice cubes
right now.
Maybe the so what I want to talk
I mean this is like
you know, our listeners who are investors,
there's a pretty high stakes question
of like what residual value there is.
But talk a little bit
more about Salesforce.
Maybe this should be a time
to learn about what it actually does
as it's massively being disrupted.
Now we get around to learning
what Salesforce is.
But I know it's like many things,
there are apps
that people built on to Salesforce,
but this sounds like we're hitting on one.
I think
probably one of the crucial questions
for like the future
of the software industry.
So talk a little bit
more about like the current approach
and what people are buying
when they buy a package or subscribe
to a service from Salesforce.
And then what
the unlock opportunity is from having,
I like, live in the same world
as all your files.
Yeah.
So I think if you if we take CRM
as a general category, say,
you know, the biggest players there are.
That's customer relationship.
Customer relationship management,
that's like where
you know Salesforce does it, SAP does
it, HubSpot does it for the mid-market.
You know, when I think about that product
and I think about the way we've used it
inside enterprise
sales organizations, essentially,
you know, it's a database of companies.
It's a database of contacts.
It's a database of deals
you have in the pipeline,
and it's a way to track all those deals
you guys hit on something before
that I think is is really it,
which is like inside companies.
There is a huge group of people
and who exists to answer
the question from management
of what is the status of something.
Right.
And you know, that can be sales
management, it can be product management.
It doesn't matter. Right?
It could be within a newsroom.
Somebody wants to know what the status is
and somebody else exists
to go figure out what the answer
to that question is.
And so fundamentally,
I think those CRM tools
are bought first and foremost to answer
what is the status, right?
What's my pipeline look like?
And to answer
what your pipeline looks like,
you need a bunch of salespeople
putting deals in.
And those deals are associated
with contacts and companies,
and they say,
when is that deal going to close?
And and essentially you were asking
the salespeople to make the updates
in the system to do that. And
just very tactically, I mean, you know,
I run a company now, we talk to a lot of
we have a lot of sales calls.
We record those calls
and they get transcribed.
And the AI then looks through them
and makes decisions
about where
this deal should be in the process.
And it's much better than having somebody
try to go update it,
because those people never updated.
Anyway, the secret of all of this
enterprise software
is that nobody was using it
the way that anybody wanted to anyway.
And so, you know,
I think that that is sort of,
you know, a lot of what's happening there.
Again, it's sort of
some of it's the coding,
some of it's just the core capabilities.
And then, you know,
you still need databases, right?
So it's like, you know,
you look at what Databricks and Snowflake
and, you know, I think those folks
are still sort of genuinely sitting
in a pretty good place where, you know,
all software has to sit on, sort of
on top of some database
that you can sort of read and write to.
But, you know,
I think some of those categories that were
specifically focused
on kind of like human input.
Now, of course,
you know, Salesforce has a whole AI thing
and they're saying, hey,
you shouldn't have humans
inputting in Salesforce, you know, to at
sales is just one small piece.
I have a whole customer support thing,
which obviously also has
an interesting implication where you know,
you're doing support with AI agents.
And so some of it comes back to seeds.
I mean, you know, it gets to be fairly
complicated, but I do think
I think the fundamental underlying thing
is anybody who buys software
that is, you know, SAS,
you're always buying for a subset
of the functionality that there's nobody
is using 100% of the functionality of SAS.
And so there's always a trade off
that's happening there where, you know,
you're spending more money
than you need to
because
you're not using all of these pieces.
And so, you know,
if you can more narrowly focus that,
that is where you could say, hey, we could
solve this kind of more narrow problem.
And not only can
we solve it more narrowly,
we can solve it way more effectively.
Because, you know, the trick with AI
is that the more specific
you are with it, the better
the output is, right?
So it's like if you know,
if outside of coding,
if you just asked ChatGPT to write you
a story, it's going to write you a very,
very median story.
Right? Sort of exactly the median.
But if you work with it and you, you know,
then you're going to get it.
The more of your own expertise
you imbuing it,
the further up above the median it's
going to be.
And it's going to be, you know,
of course, that also means it's less
where the line is between
what's AI and what's not.
AI is going to continue to get blurrier.
Joe, how much does cloud code
actually cost?
Do you know?
Well, I paid for the,
200 or $200 a month version, but,
like high roller.
Yeah. No, but, you know, I think it's.
You could get it
with the pro version of like,
or whatever
the, the version of that below $20.
But I hit a limit fairly quickly and
I was like, I didn't have my website up.
So like and then I bought the fact.
Then I paid $5 for the extra compute
and I was like, this is dumb.
I think I'll just.
Yeah. Oh, okay.
So we going out to two nice dinners,
right?
That's not
you know, when I think about that way,
it doesn't seem that big of a deal. It's
worth it to you. Yeah. Okay.
So I think we can all agree
this is like a valuable service
that cloud code is providing.
But we touched on this in the intro.
It seems like the models
just keep replicating themselves really,
really quickly.
So anything that cloud code can do,
I would expect another model
will come in in like a month,
maybe less, and do the exact same thing.
What does that mean for the actual
like valuations of these companies
and the models like how are they going
to monetize it when it seems so difficult
to actually differentiate yourself,
especially
for like a substantial portion of time?
Yeah.
Well, so again here,
I think we have to distinguish
between cloud code and the cloud model.
So in Cloud Code's case,
if you're using, you know the latest
version, you're using opus 4.5
which is the model.
Opus 4.5 has a price of,
you know, something in the dollar, 50
to $2 for a million input tokens
and whatever it is on the output,
which is like roughly
the going rate for cutting edge models.
Gemini three Pro is the same price.
OpenAI, ChatGPT 5.2 is there.
They're all the same price.
So the first thing is, is
you have to differentiate between those.
And so I think a big part of
what anthropic is trying to do
is they're trying to lock people
into cloud code.
In fact,
there's just some, controversy amongst
some nerds, where, open code,
which is a competitor to cloud Code,
used to let you use your cloud Max $200.
So the trick with the cloud
Max plan is if you're just buying those,
that number of tokens, it would cost
you significantly more than $200.
It is a super, super discounted plan.
You are probably you have the access
I have the access to use,
I would guess in the
thousand or $2,000 of tokens,
for my $200 a month.
So it's it's a very, very heavily
subsidized plan and open code,
which is an open source version
of cloud code, a sort of competitor.
They had found a way that they would let
you use your cloud
Max plan
with open code and anthropic last week.
Shut that down. Yeah.
And some open code, people got very upset,
because they
said, like, this is not
what you're supposed to do, or.
I mean, I'm
not sure exactly what they said.
I never felt like I got
a particularly good argument out of it.
But, you know,
I do think part of what they're
trying to get at, because is
that, you know, at the very top models
like these are
all amazing, like the Google,
OpenAI and anthropic,
their best models are all on par
with each other.
I mean,
I would move them around a little bit.
I still think opus
4.5 is the best model out there.
But you know,
I mean that might change tomorrow.
Like, and that's where something like
Cloud Code is really interesting
because it's a, a product
that is very it's just theirs.
It's not it's a piece of software.
It's not an AI model.
And so it's sort of it's
less able to be disrupted.
Now, again, I think
if somebody else wanted to copy that.
Exactly, they could.
Codex has one, Gemini has one.
I just think they take a very different
tact with it where it's much less.
And so,
you know,
I think what they're trying to do
is get developers like me
to feel very comfortable inside that,
so that when we go open, I still open
Codex or try Gemini or I was playing with
open Code the other day and,
it just doesn't feel familiar
in the same way that, you know, if you're
trying to move somebody from a PC
to a mac, it doesn't feel familiar, right?
They want to own like the ecosystem, the.
Environment. The environment.
Work on One world.
Noah,
thank you so much for coming on Atlas.
I was like dying to do an episode
about this topic.
By the way, I don't have I psychosis,
I have a cloud complex.
Why is everyone making that joke? Wait.
Which joke? The psychosis joke.
I thought you're going to be proud of me
for saying cloud complex. Oh.
Oh, that is very good.
I it's like I do one pun
finally for Tracy.
No, it's like,
well, I was over making that joke.
Well, I was thinking that was a joke.
I was handed a shirt.
I finally make a pun
and you just jump right over it.
Well, everyone keeps saying
that cloud code is AI psychosis
for smart people, right?
Like, how did that become a thing?
Yeah. All right.
But there's a good. Fun
also very bro coded I find.
You think so all of. AI is bro coded.
This is true.
We should talk more about this.
You know, we should have David Shaw on.
He's been doing a lot of polling
about various demographics
and how they feel about AI.
We should, And, yeah, some interesting I.
See into that.
Yeah, we should, do that.
Anyway, Noah,
thank you so much for coming on out, love.
Thanks for having me.
Well, that was fun. Tracy.
I really like I.
It's obvious
to anyone who's been within five minutes,
five feet of me for the last two weeks.
I'm like, totally addicted and gone down.
I never gone down the rabbit
hole and stuff.
But like, I for the first time
unironically, I'm like, okay,
this is transformative technology
beyond being very impressive.
Technology, right?
So I've been coming to a conclusion,
which is that, you know,
I can be both under hyped,
and overvalued simultaneously.
Like, I feel like that's kind of
where we are at the moment, where.
You're making your stock call.
Yeah. No, but seriously like it.
It's a big deal.
It's going to change the way we work.
But is it monetizable?
Can you differentiate the actual models?
The better
the technology gets, like, the easier
it is
to just do what everyone else is doing.
And also like
the compute gets cheaper and cheaper.
So I just don't know how you monetize
this. Well.
So that's very interesting.
His point, which is that it's
the tokens are heavily subsidized still.
Yeah.
And so that if you're paying
and actually using that $200 max program
and you actually use it to the limit,
Claude is going to lose money on this.
Right? And then the prices keep dropping.
And I know, like Claude code is okay.
They're attempting to create something
that resembles a traditional software
ecosystem that you feel as a user
that you're locked into.
But so far in my various
like since November 2022,
when I started playing with AI,
it hasn't felt like anyone has established
lock in with anything.
And it's very,
it's very movable.
And I suspect even though I have this file
now on my desktop
that has a file called Claude mode
that gives instructions, etc.,
I'm certain that if I open this file
with Codex or Googles,
I could probably just pick it up the same.
Yeah.
I also think there's a fundamental issue
with the lock in strategy,
because when you're talking
about technology in the internet, like
it just feels very against the grain
to try to lock people into anything.
And we've seen various projects
over the years
and it's it's a lot harder than it looks.
Yeah.
I mean, I guess I would say
it's a lot harder than it looks.
But then we also know the flip side,
which is that tons of people are locked
into software that they hate. Right?
Yeah. People are.
Oh, I hate people.
How many times have you or
I hate outlook, right?
Or I hate Microsoft Teams and I hate this
and I spend money on it every month
and my organization can't move off of it
or we can't migrate off of it.
So I do think that cuts both ways.
I do think he offered the best explanation
I've heard of why
the AI coding models are a threat to a lot
of pretty big software businesses,
especially, especially the point
about how the user never uses
all of the features that they actually
that the software got built for.
And therefore maybe the build versus
buy calculation really starts to shift
when they can just design that one feature
very quickly.
I totally agree.
On the software side,
it seems like an existential threat, but
just like the locked in ecosystem
of a particular model.
I know he said it's not actually a model,
but that seems like a bigger issue to me.
I don't know, I guess we'll see.
We're going to see and I don't know,
I kind of think we're gonna see quickly.
Yeah.
That's again, that's the only certainty is
like, stuff is happening.
Stuff is. Happening now. Yeah.
All right. Shall we leave it
there? Let's leave it there.
Okay.
