Hey
 everyone,
 it's
 Anna.
 All right,


before
 we
 start
 the
 show,
 I
 want
 to
 talk


about
 Valentine's
 Day
 because
 of
 course


we
 are
 already
 thinking
 about
 it
 over


here
 at
 Modern
 Love.
 We're
 hoping
 you


can
 help
 us
 out.
 We
 want
 to
 know
 the


most
 romantic
 thing
 that's
 ever
 happened


to
 you.
 Or
 if
 it
 didn't
 happen
 to
 you,


the
 most
 romantic
 thing
 you've
 ever
 seen


or
 witnessed.
 It
 could
 be
 something


grand,
 a
 romcom
 style
 gesture.
 Maybe


someone
 stood
 outside
 your
 window
 with
 a


boom
 box
 or
 ran
 through
 the
 airport
 to


stop
 you
 from
 leaving.
 Or
 it
 could
 be


something
 small
 like
 someone
 knows
 you


hate
 olives,
 so
 they
 always
 pick
 them


off
 your
 plate
 before
 you
 dig
 in.
 Or


someone
 slips
 a
 note
 in
 your
 lunchbox


every
 morning
 to
 remind
 you
 how
 much
 you


mean
 to
 them.
 Whatever
 made
 you
 feel


that
 rush
 of
 romance
 from
 the
 big


moments
 to
 the
 tiny
 ones,
 we
 want
 to


hear
 about
 it
 and
 we
 want
 to
 know
 why
 it


was
 so
 romantic
 to
 you.
 If
 you
 have
 a


story
 in
 mind,
 record
 a
 voice
 memo
 and


email
 it
 to
 us
 at
 modernlove
 podcastny


times.com
 by
 February
 4th
 and
 we
 might


use
 your
 story
 on
 the
 show.
 That's


modern
 love
 podcastny
 times.com.
 And


once
 again,
 your
 deadline
 is
 February


4th.
 Thanks
 so
 much.
 We
 can't
 wait
 to


hear
 from
 you.
 Now,
 here's
 today's


episode.


>> Love
 now
 and
 fall
 in
 love.
 I
 love


>> love
 was
 stronger
 than
 anything.


>> For
 the
 love
 of
 love


>> and
 I
 love
 you
 more
 than
 anything.


>> There's
 love.


>> From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Anna
 Martin


and
 this
 is
 Modern
 Love.
 I
 want
 to
 do
 a


thought
 exercise
 really
 quick
 and
 just
 a


warning,
 I'm
 about
 to
 get
 extremely


personal
 extremely
 quickly.


I
 would
 like
 you
 to
 think
 about
 your
 own


sex
 life.
 I'll
 pause.
 Think
 about
 it.


Is
 it
 fabulous?


Is
 it
 lacking?
 Is
 it
 kind
 of
 a
 mix?


50/50.
 When
 was
 the
 last
 time
 you
 really


considered
 what
 turns
 you
 on?
 What


actually
 makes
 your
 body
 feel
 good?
 And


what
 you
 really
 want
 out
 of
 sex?
 These


are
 all
 questions
 my
 guest
 today
 wants


us
 to
 ask
 ourselves.


Her
 name
 is
 Dr.
 Nicole
 McNichols.
 She's


a
 professor
 at
 the
 University
 of


Washington
 where
 she
 teaches
 a
 class
 all


about
 human
 sexuality.
 As
 you
 might


guess,
 this
 is
 the
 most
 popular
 class
 on


campus.
 There's
 literally
 always
 a
 wait


list.
 And
 now
 she
 has
 a
 new
 book
 coming


out
 called
 You
 Could
 Be
 Having
 Better


Sex.


To
 write
 this
 book,
 Dr.
 McNichols
 has


poured
 over
 years
 of
 data,
 countless


studies
 on
 what
 leads
 to
 good,


fulfilling
 sex.
 And
 today
 she's
 here
 to


take
 us
 back
 into
 the
 classroom
 and


teach
 us
 all
 how
 to
 have
 the
 best
 sex
 of


our
 lives.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 if
 it
 isn't


obvious,
 this
 conversation
 is
 very


explicit.
 So
 if
 you
 got
 kids
 nearby,


maybe
 pop
 on
 some
 headphones
 or
 save


this
 one
 till
 later.


>> Dr.
 Nicole
 McNichols,
 welcome
 to
 Modern


Love.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much,
 Anna.
 I'm
 so
 excited


to
 be
 here.
 So,
 Nicole,
 you
 teach
 the


most
 popular
 course
 at
 the
 University
 of


Washington
 to
 over
 4,000
 students
 each


year.
 It's
 called
 the
 diversity
 of
 human


sexuality.
 And
 I
 have
 to
 say,
 if
 I
 was


an
 undergrad,
 I
 would
 be
 rushing
 to
 sign


up
 for
 this
 class.
 [laughter]
 What
 do


you
 think
 that
 um
 constant
 weight
 list,


all
 those
 butts
 and
 seats,
 as
 it
 were,


what
 does
 that
 speak
 to?
 What
 are
 people


curious
 about?
 What
 do
 they
 want
 to
 find


out?
 I
 think
 students
 are
 coming
 in
 with


so
 much
 curiosity
 about
 sex,
 which
 is


wonderful
 because
 sexual
 curiosity
 is


exactly
 what
 drives
 us
 all
 to
 be
 having


better
 sex
 and
 more
 connected
 sexual


experiences.
 And
 they
 have
 been
 brought


up
 either
 within
 their
 communities
 or


with
 their
 teachers
 or
 with
 the
 schools


that
 they've
 been
 at
 with
 usually
 a


complete
 lack
 of
 sex
 education.
 I
 mean,


there's
 no
 federally
 mandated
 sex


education.
 In
 fact,
 many
 schools,
 many


states
 require
 schools
 to
 teach


information.
 That's
 just
 [snorts]
 wrong


and
 that's
 stigmatizing
 and
 invoking
 a


lot
 of
 shame.
 So,
 to
 be
 able
 to
 tell


them,
 I'm
 here
 to
 make
 you
 relax,
 feel


comfortable,
 because
 I
 think
 that's


often
 the
 biggest
 surprise


>> is
 just
 how
 important


pleasure
 is
 in
 our
 lives,
 right?
 We
 tend


to
 think
 of
 pleasure
 as
 being
 something


that's
 a
 treat.
 And
 so
 many
 students,


they
 come
 into
 my
 classroom,
 they
 are


used
 to
 thinking
 of
 pleasure
 as


something
 that
 they
 get
 to
 do
 after
 all


their
 homework
 is
 done,
 after
 their
 two


jobs
 that
 they're
 often
 holding


basically.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> It's
 dessert.
 I
 mean,
 we've
 all
 grown
 up


in
 this
 very
 puritanical
 culture
 that


treats
 sex
 like
 dessert.
 You
 get
 lucky.


Even
 if
 the
 language
 that
 we
 use.
 So
 to


be
 able
 to
 first
 start
 from
 the
 point
 of


view
 that
 there
 is
 reams
 of
 research


showing
 how
 critical
 positive
 emotions


and
 [snorts]
 pleasure
 are
 to
 our


well-being.
 And
 not
 just
 to
 our


well-being,
 but
 to
 our
 ability
 to
 think


creatively,
 to
 problem
 solve,
 to
 broaden


our
 perspectives,
 and
 seek
 out
 sources


of
 social
 support.


>> [snorts]


>> All
 of
 which
 are
 going
 to
 help
 us
 cope


with
 the
 inevitable
 challenges
 and


stressors
 in
 our
 lives.
 So
 just
 starting


from
 the
 standpoint
 of
 a
 pleasure
 is


important,
 sex
 is
 important,
 and
 b
 most


of
 what
 you've
 been
 taught
 about
 sex,
 if


you've
 been
 taught
 about
 sex,
 is
 likely


wrong,
 right?
 Like
 let's
 start
 let's


start
 over.
 [laughter]


>> Nicole,
 sign
 me.
 I'm
 on
 the
 wait
 list.


I'm
 31,
 by
 the
 I
 don't
 know if
 I
 could


pass
 as
 a
 college
 student,
 but
 add


[laughter]
 me
 to
 the
 bottom
 of
 that
 damn


weight
 list.
 Go.


>> I
 mean,
 you're
 speaking
 about
 sex
 as


central
 to
 living
 a
 creative,
 fulfilled


life,
 pleasure
 as
 not
 just
 a
 treat
 that


we
 relegate
 to
 a
 corner,
 you
 know,
 when


when
 when
 we've
 been
 good
 and
 we
 deserve


it.
 But
 I
 I
 have
 to
 believe
 you
 didn't


always
 see
 sex
 this
 way,
 right?
 When
 you


started
 teaching
 this
 course,
 what
 was


happening
 in
 your
 in
 your
 life
 at
 the


time
 that
 you
 stepped
 into
 teaching
 this


course?
 I
 was
 at
 a
 time
 in
 my
 life
 when


I
 desperately
 needed
 help
 with
 my
 own


sex
 life.
 I
 was
 [snorts and laughter]
 a


mother
 of
 three
 young
 children
 and,
 you


know,
 a
 husband
 and
 two
 dogs,
 very
 needy


dogs.
 [laughter]


And
 I
 was
 so
 thrown
 into
 motherhood
 and,


you
 know,
 [snorts]
 the
 waking
 up
 at


night
 and
 the,
 you
 know,
 exhaustion,


joy,
 I
 mean,
 incredible
 satisfaction
 and


fulfillment
 from
 that,
 but
 just
 feeling


exhausted
 and
 touched
 out
 and
 [snorts]


having
 sex
 at
 that
 point,
 it
 starts
 to


feel
 like
 you're
 just
 fulfilling
 another


person's
 physical
 needs,
 which
 is,


>> you
 know,
 and
 just


the
 guilt
 that
 came
 with
 feeling
 that


way
 and
 feeling
 like
 I
 knew
 that
 I


wanted
 to
 be
 able
 to
 connect
 with
 my


husband
 and
 knowing
 sex
 was
 important


but
 not
 really
 knowing
 how
 to
 work


through
 that.
 It
 was
 it
 was
 hard
 and
 it


definitely
 weighed
 on
 our
 relationship
 a


bit
 at
 the
 time.


>> And
 this
 is
 the
 moment
 in
 your
 life
 when


you
 step
 in
 to
 teach
 this
 human


sexuality
 course.


>> Yes.
 Well,
 actually,
 Anna,
 I'm
 glad
 you


mentioned
 that
 because
 one
 other


critical
 factor
 about
 my
 condition
 when


I
 started
 teaching
 for
 the
 first
 time


this
 human
 sexuality
 course
 is
 that
 I


was
 also
 I
 had
 two
 young
 children
 and
 I


was
 6
 months
 pregnant
 with
 my
 third.


Good.
 So,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 part
 of
 the


reason
 I
 got
 selected
 is
 because
 the


department
 figured
 I
 probably
 already


knew
 something
 about
 sex
 given
 that


[laughter]
 I
 was


>> They
 were
 like,
 she's
 at
 least
 had
 it


three
 times.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 she
 seems
 qualified.
 Exactly.


Wow,
 what
 what
 a
 confluence
 of
 personal


and
 professional.
 I
 mean
 to
 to
 put
 it,


you
 know,
 in
 a
 zoomed
 out
 way,
 but
 all


these
 factors,


>> you
 know,
 converging
 at
 this
 point
 when


you
 step
 in
 to
 teach
 this
 course,
 I


assume
 you're
 like
 soaking
 in
 the


research.


>> What
 are
 you
 discovering?
 What
 are
 you


uncovering?
 Well,
 I
 was
 fascinated
 and


completely
 blown
 away
 at
 just
 how


important
 sexual
 satisfaction
 is
 to


relationship
 satisfaction.
 And
 I
 I
 you


know,
 everyone
 assumes
 I
 know
 Yeah.


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Sex
 is
 important,


>> right?
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 I
 feel
 like


intuitively
 that
 makes
 sense,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But
 [snorts]
 looking
 at


longitudinal
 data
 from,
 you
 know,
 Dr.


Amy
 Muse
 of
 thousands
 of
 couples
 over


time
 finds
 that
 it's
 not
 just
 having
 a


happy
 relationship
 is
 going
 to
 lead
 to


necessarily
 better
 or
 more
 satisfying


sex.


>> That
 the
 direction
 of
 that
 is
 the


opposite.
 That
 it's
 usually
 sexual


satisfaction


that's
 preceding
 relationship


satisfaction.
 So
 we
 might
 assume
 okay


well
 if
 I
 just
 work
 on
 my
 and
 trust
 me


working
 on
 your
 relationship
 is
 critical


and
 we
 can
 get
 into
 that.
 But
 just


understanding
 that
 if
 you
 look
 at


couples
 over
 time
 who
 are
 asked
 to
 keep


daily
 diaries
 of
 how
 satisfied
 they
 feel


in
 their
 relationships
 and
 what
 their


mental
 well-being
 is
 and
 how
 happy
 and


satisfied
 with
 life
 they
 feel
 overall


and
 how
 satisfying
 their
 sex
 life
 is.


What
 you
 see
 is
 that
 when
 an
 uptick
 in


sexual
 satisfaction
 occurs,


the
 joy
 and
 satisfaction
 in
 the


relationship
 follows.
 So,
 it's
 [snorts]


a
 pathway
 in
 that
 people
 don't
 really


appreciate
 enough,
 I
 don't
 think.


>> And
 I'm
 just
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 it
 back


mostly
 because
 I
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 I


understand
 it.
 It's
 like,
 okay,
 yeah,


good
 sex,
 good
 relationship,
 whatever.


What
 you're
 saying
 is
 working
 on
 your


relationship,
 that's
 not
 necessarily


going
 to
 lead
 you
 to
 have
 better
 sex.


What
 the
 data
 does
 prove
 is
 that
 having


better,
 more
 fulfilling
 sex
 is
 a
 way
 to


lead
 towards
 more
 relationship


satisfaction.
 It's
 like
 the
 sex
 is
 the


vehicle.
 The
 maybe
 that's
 the
 wrong


word,
 but
 is
 that
 right?


>> The
 mechanism.
 We
 love
 the
 word


mechanism.
 [laughter]
 Vehicle
 sounds


better.


>> Okay.
 Sex
 is
 the
 mechanism
 for


relationship
 satisfaction.
 Now,
 that
 is


really
 that
 is
 really
 interesting.
 I


mean,
 you're
 you're
 learning
 this
 stuff.


You're
 immersed
 in
 this
 as
 you're


teaching
 this
 course.
 How
 many
 years
 has


it
 been
 now
 that
 you're
 teaching
 this?


>> 15.


>> 15.


>> 15.
 Yes.


>> Over
 the
 [laughter]
 course
 of
 that,
 have


you
 implemented
 the
 things
 you've


learned
 in
 your
 course
 to
 your
 own
 sex


life,
 your
 intimate
 life
 with
 your


husband?


>> Absolutely.
 M
 the
 other
 thing
 that


really
 gave
 me
 sort
 of
 a
 sense
 of
 hope,


right?
 Because
 you
 can
 think
 sex
 is


super
 important,
 but
 oh
 my
 god,
 like
 how


am
 I
 supposed
 to
 be
 carving
 out
 having


sex
 all
 the
 time
 with
 my
 husband
 when
 I


am
 [laughter]
 so
 busy
 with
 all
 of
 my


kids
 and
 my
 teaching
 load?
 And
 I
 was


also
 really
 heartened
 to
 see,
 and
 you


know,
 I'm
 a
 data
 nerd,
 so
 forgive


[laughter]
 this.


>> I
 love
 it.
 But
 you
 know,
 one
 of the


hush-
 hush
 questions
 I
 often
 get
 from


other
 couples
 that
 I
 have
 had
 too
 was,


"Okay,
 but
 like
 what's
 that
 magic


frequency?"
 Right?
 In
 other
 words,
 we


know
 sex
 is
 important,
 but
 like
 how


often
 do
 you
 really
 need
 to
 be
 having
 it


to
 see
 these
 benefits
 that
 we
 know
 it


leads
 to
 with
 relationship
 satisfaction?


>> And
 the
 answer,
 Anna,
 and
 this
 is
 a


mean,
 an
 average.
 [laughter]


>> I
 love
 it.
 What's
 the
 number?
 once
 a


week,
 which
 is
 not
 an
 astronomical


amount
 of
 time,
 right?
 No,
 it
 is
 not.


>> And
 it's
 [snorts]
 not
 that,
 you
 know,


couples
 who
 have
 sex
 more
 than
 once
 a


week,
 that's
 fantastic
 if
 they
 want
 to


do
 that.
 But
 when
 we
 look
 at
 the
 benefit


of
 sex
 to
 relationship
 well-being,
 it


doesn't
 increase
 after
 about
 once
 a


week,


>> which
 means
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 so
 for
 those


of
 us
 who
 love
 to
 have
 a
 target,
 right?


Like
 I
 work
 out
 three
 times
 a
 week.
 I


get
 in
 society.
 Totally.
 Yeah.


>> I
 get
 my
 protein
 count
 in.


>> It's
 nice
 to
 know,
 okay,
 that
 target
 is


once
 a
 week.


>> I
 really
 like
 this
 because
 for
 many


couples,
 I
 feel
 like
 hearing
 that


number,
 one
 time
 a
 week,
 having
 sex
 one


time
 a
 week
 is
 implementable
 and
 quite


doable
 and
 not
 intimidating.


>> Exactly.


>> Okay.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 have
 questions


about
 our
 sex
 lives,
 but
 not
 all
 of
 us


can
 take
 your
 course,
 unfortunately.
 So


for
 someone
 who
 wants
 to
 have
 better


sex,
 where
 would
 you
 tell
 them
 to
 start?


>> Well,
 I
 can
 give
 you
 the
 10,000
 foot


answer
 and
 the
 specific
 answer
 to
 this.


Perfect.
 Right.
 So
 the
 10,000
 foot


answer
 is
 that
 unfortunately
 I
 cannot


offer
 you
 a
 GLP
 one
 shot
 to
 improve
 your


[laughter]
 sex
 life.


>> Damn.
 But
 I
 can
 give
 you
 a
 blueprint.


[music]


that
 blueprint
 when
 we
 come
 back.


[music]


[music]


>> [music]


[music]


>> I
 want
 to
 throw
 out
 some
 different


scenarios
 that
 people
 could
 be


experiencing.
 And
 really
 what
 I
 mean
 by


that
 is,
 you
 know,
 the
 different
 types


of
 sex
 people
 could
 be
 having.
 There
 is


casual
 sex
 certainly,
 which
 I
 want
 to


start
 there.
 Not
 for
 personal
 reasons,


[laughter]


>> not
 Gordon.
 Who
 would
 know?
 No,
 I


definitely
 don't.
 Um,
 but
 let's
 say,
 you


know,
 let's
 say
 someone
 is
 single,


they're
 dating,
 they're
 having
 casual


sex,
 and
 they
 keep
 finding
 themselves


having
 experiences
 that
 are
 just
 not


great.
 They
 don't
 necessarily
 have
 to
 be


like
 awful,
 but
 they're
 just
 not
 great.


Applying
 these
 sort
 of,
 you
 know,
 ways


to
 to
 have
 better
 sex
 um
 to
 this


situation.
 What
 would
 be
 your
 first


question
 for
 them?


I
 will
 say
 that
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 casual


sex
 specifically,
 I
 have
 a
 very


different
 view
 than
 a
 lot
 of
 the


messaging
 that
 we've
 seen
 [snorts]
 about


sort
 of
 the
 the
 types
 of
 impact
 that


casual
 sex
 has
 on
 people
 and


relationships,
 which
 has
 mostly
 been


negative.
 Right?
 Most
 of
 what
 we
 see
 in


the
 media
 is
 fearful
 messaging.
 It's


awful.
 [snorts]


It's
 terrible
 for
 women.
 It
 leads
 to
 a


sense
 of
 isolation
 and
 despair.
 And
 the


reality
 is
 that
 it
 absolutely
 can
 lead


to
 those
 feelings.
 [snorts]


>> But
 casual
 sex
 can
 also
 be
 awesome.
 It


can
 be
 exciting.
 It
 can
 be
 pleasurable.


It
 can
 be
 a
 form
 of
 sexual
 adventure.
 Um


I
 there's
 a
 study
 I
 love
 that
 even
 shows


that.
 [laughter]


>> Sorry,
 I'm
 just
 smiling
 because
 I'm


like,
 hell
 yeah.
 Yeah,
 that
 among
 I
 even


talk
 about
 a
 study
 in
 my
 class
 showing


that
 in
 the
 right
 context,
 casual
 sex


can
 lead
 to
 an
 increased
 GPA.
 [laughter]


Okay,
 I
 am
 loving
 that.


>> This
 is
 real
 data
 and
 the
 key,
 right?
 I


mean,
 because
 and
 this
 is
 what
 I
 see.
 I


see
 this
 in
 my
 classroom
 and
 it
 is
 comp


that
 what's
 so
 nice
 about
 having
 such
 a


large
 class
 is
 I
 can
 pull
 students
 and


replicate
 findings
 that
 we
 see
 in
 the


national
 you
 know
 nationally


representative
 data
 and
 when
 you
 really


poll
 people
 about
 okay
 what
 was
 your


last
 sexual
 experience
 truly
 like
 it's


very
 mixed
 right
 and
 it
 tends
 to
 break


into
 the
 following
 you
 see
 about
 a
 third


of
 people
 who
 are
 like
 me
 it
 was
 really


like


>> unsat
 satisfying
 and
 it
 was
 sort
 of
 like


it
 left
 me
 feeling
 empty,
 which
 is
 kind


of
 the
 only
 message
 we
 get.
 But
 then
 we


get
 another
 third
 who
 say
 it
 was


awesome.
 It
 was
 pleasurable.
 It
 was
 an


adventure.
 It
 was
 the
 like
 the
 leadup,


the
 game,
 the
 excitement,
 the


anticipation,
 the
 not
 knowing
 that
 can


be
 incredible,
 right?
 And
 then
 you
 get


about
 another
 third
 that
 are
 like,
 eh,


it
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 both.
 And
 you


know,
 and
 so
 I
 see
 that
 exactly


replicated
 in
 my
 classroom
 in
 the


nationally
 representative
 data.
 And


here's
 the
 other
 thing
 that's


interesting
 about
 this
 data
 is
 that


people
 might
 think,
 oh,
 okay,
 right,
 the


common
 reaction.
 Well,
 clearly
 it's


probably
 the
 men
 who
 are
 saying
 it's


awesome
 and
 the
 women
 who
 are
 saying
 it


sucks,
 but
 actually
 there
 is
 a
 small


gender
 difference,
 but
 not
 nearly
 as
 big


as
 you
 might
 think.
 In
 other
 words,


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 women
 having
 a
 lot
 of


fabulous
 casual
 sex,
 right?
 And
 this
 is


where
 I
 love
 to
 throw
 out
 the
 statistics


from
 a
 very
 famous
 study.


>> I
 love
 how
 your
 brain
 is
 full
 of
 sex


[laughter]
 data
 and
 I
 love
 it.


>> I
 know
 I'm
 a
 sex
 nerd.
 um
 which
 is
 that


when
 you
 look
 at
 this
 gender
 difference


that
 exists
 between
 men
 and
 women


enjoying
 casual
 sex,
 it
 goes
 away
 when


you
 control
 for
 the
 variable
 of
 orgasm.


Meaning
 in
 plain
 English


>> that
 when
 women
 have
 an
 orgasm,


>> they
 enjoy
 casual
 sex
 on
 average
 just
 as


much
 as
 men
 do.
 So,


>> pause.
 [laughter]


>> Let's
 let
 that
 sink
 in.
 Yeah,
 let's
 just


let
 that
 sink
 in.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 say
 it
 back
 to
 make
 sure
 I


understand.


>> There
 is
 a
 discrepancy
 in
 terms
 of


gender
 that's
 been
 proven
 for
 enjoyment


of
 casual
 sex,
 what
 you're
 saying.
 But


when
 a
 woman
 has
 an
 orgasm,
 that


discrepancy
 lessens
 or
 even
 disappears.


Disappears.


And
 then
 the
 question
 of
 course
 becomes


how


>> how
 are
 they
 pulling
 that
 off?


>> Yes.
 [laughter]
 Yes.
 And
 what
 does
 the


data
 show?


>> Okay,
 so
 this
 is
 juicy.
 the
 data
 show


[laughter]


and
 you
 know
 and
 you
 know
 when
 you
 hear


this
 it's
 per
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 of


common
 sense
 but
 the
 data
 show
 that
 it


really
 comes
 down
 to
 motivation.
 In


other
 words,
 what
 what
 are
 you
 looking


for
 in
 the
 experience?
 And
 are
 you


looking
 for
 adventure
 and
 and
 play
 and


fun
 and
 experimentation
 and
 or
 you
 know


and
 letting
 off
 stress
 or
 even
 sexual


validation
 meaning
 well
 you're
 coming


into
 yourself
 and
 you
 kind
 of
 want
 to


you
 know
 gain
 some
 confidence
 it


actually
 can
 be
 effective
 for
 that
 as


well.
 Um,
 and
 so
 when
 your
 motivation
 is


those
 what
 we
 call
 autonomously
 driven


reasons,
 right?
 When
 there's
 a
 sense
 of


what
 we
 call
 self-determination


within
 the
 approach
 to
 casual
 sex,


>> it
 can
 be
 really
 exciting
 and
 hot
 and


fun.
 On
 the
 contrary
 to
 that,
 when
 there


is
 a
 need
 for,


you
 know,
 a
 sense
 that
 you're
 having
 it


because
 you
 actually
 want
 something


deeper,
 but
 you're
 not
 quite
 sure
 how
 to


ask
 for
 that.


>> Mhm.


>> It
 can
 lead
 to
 really
 poor
 results.


>> Autonomous
 motivations,
 meaning
 driven


from


>> internal


>> internal
 and
 you
 are
 clear
 on
 your


purpose.
 Huh.
 That
 is
 the
 greatest


indicator
 of
 satisfaction
 in
 casual
 sex.


>> Yes,
 it
 is.
 In
 other
 words,
 you
 could


sort
 of
 sum
 it
 up
 as
 you're
 coming
 to


the
 experience
 from
 a
 place
 of
 freedom.


True
 freedom.
 Not
 because
 of
 norms,
 not


because
 you
 think
 it's
 the
 only
 thing


available,
 but
 because
 you
 are
 driven


and
 have
 a
 sense
 of
 purpose
 about
 it.
 as


he
 said


>> in
 terms
 of
 casual
 sex.
 So,
 let's
 say


someone
 is
 truly
 going
 into
 casual
 sex


with
 um
 with
 those
 autonomous
 reasons,


with
 a
 clarity
 of
 purpose.
 You
 know,
 you


you're
 casual
 sex
 is
 often
 with
 a


partner
 you
 might
 not
 know
 so
 well.
 What


are
 some
 ways,
 which
 is
 tricky
 because


this
 is
 like
 a
 new
 body
 to
 navigate.


What
 are
 some
 tips
 you
 have
 for
 sort
 of


maximizing
 pleasure
 when
 you're


basically
 kind
 of
 sleeping
 with
 a


stranger?
 Yes,
 exactly.
 Um,
 [snorts]
 and


this
 is
 where
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 it's


relevant
 to
 mention
 my
 consent


manifesto.


>> This
 is
 a
 very
 [laughter]
 important


thing
 to
 bring
 up
 now.
 Of
 course.


>> Yes.
 In
 my
 book.
 Um,
 because
 you
 we've


had
 conversations
 to
 date
 about
 Okay.


The
 most
 important
 thing
 with
 casual
 sex


is
 consent.
 True.
 Yes.
 But
 we
 have
 a


very
 limited
 definition
 of
 consent
 right


now
 in
 our
 culture
 which
 is
 mostly


limited
 to
 our
 physical
 boundaries,


right?
 And
 there's
 this
 idea
 that
 you,


you
 know,
 sign
 some
 contract
 in
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 experience
 and
 you


either
 have
 consent
 or
 you
 don't,
 right?


And
 that
 it's
 just
 sort
 of
 black
 and


white,
 right?
 And
 that
 is
 that's
 really


problematic
 for
 a
 variety
 of
 reasons.


But
 the
 you
 know
 place
 I
 really
 try
 to


take
 this
 conversation
 to
 you
 know
 both


with
 my
 you
 know
 my
 my
 students
 and
 when


I
 give
 talks
 is
 we
 need
 to
 start


bringing
 in
 not
 just
 respect
 for
 each


other's
 physical
 boundaries
 but
 respect


for
 each
 other's
 social
 and
 emotional


boundaries
 as
 well.
 Right?
 And
 so
 what
 I


mean
 by
 that
 is
 we
 need
 to
 have
 a
 sense


of
 emotional
 honesty.
 We
 need
 to
 be


normalizing
 things
 like
 saying,
 "Are
 you


okay
 if
 this
 is
 just
 for
 fun?"
 Or,


"How
 are
 you
 feeling
 right
 now?"
 Or,
 you


know,
 "Where
 do
 you
 see
 this
 standing?"


Like,
 you
 know, "I
 can't
 tell
 what
 you


want.
 Can
 you
 give
 me
 a
 clue?"
 In
 other


words,
 if
 you,


you
 know,
 we
 need
 to
 be
 not
 just
 aware


of
 what
 our
 own
 purpose
 is
 with
 the


casual
 sex
 experience,
 but
 also
 for


consent
 to
 exist,
 be
 aware
 of
 the


purpose
 that
 our
 partner
 is
 bringing
 to


the
 experience.
 Because


>> when
 those
 two
 purposes
 are
 misaligned,


that's
 what
 leads
 to
 a
 negative


experience.
 And
 same
 with
 a
 commitment


to
 mutual
 pleasure.


>> Yeah.
 Talk
 to
 me
 more
 about
 what
 that


means
 to
 you
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 to
 have


fulfilling
 casual
 sex.
 It
 really
 means


being
 comfortable
 communicating
 and


having
 a
 certain
 handful
 of
 phrases
 that


you
 feel
 comfortable
 using
 throughout


and
 having
 respect
 for
 and
 an


understanding
 of
 your
 own
 sexual


communication
 style
 as
 well
 as
 the


sexual
 communication
 style
 of
 your


partner.
 Um
 because
 it
 really
 it
 it
 it's


about
 being
 attuned


to
 what
 are
 the
 best
 ways
 that
 I
 can


exchange
 information
 about
 what
 I
 want,


what
 turns
 me
 on,
 and
 then
 also
 having


phrases
 to
 check
 in
 with
 your
 partner.


So
 it
 might
 be,


>> and
 this
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be,
 you
 know,


necessarily
 a
 sitdown
 conversation.


It
 can
 be
 beforehand
 of
 what
 you're


excited
 to
 do
 and
 sometimes
 that
 does


happen
 and
 that's
 fantastic.
 But
 it
 can


be
 as
 simple
 as
 just
 having
 phrases
 that


you're
 comfortable
 using
 like
 guide
 me,


right?


>> Ooh,


>> that's
 kind
 of
 hot.
 I
 like
 that.


>> Yeah,
 guide
 me
 is
 kind
 of
 hot,
 right?


[laughter]


>> Show
 me,
 right?


>> Sometimes
 the
 two
 [laughter]


>> tell
 me,
 right?
 Tell
 me.
 um
 size
 moans,


right?
 You
 know
 what
 a
 lot
 of
 people


don't
 realize
 is
 that
 those
 groans
 and


size
 we
 only
 we
 only
 project
 that
 at
 two


times.
 One
 when
 we're
 in
 pain
 and
 the


other
 when
 we're
 in
 pleasure


experiencing
 pleasure.


>> Yeah.
 So
 it
 really
 operates
 at
 a


neurological
 level
 to
 communicate


pleasure
 but
 also
 to
 help
 you
 experience


pleasure.
 I
 mean
 okay
 so
 I'm
 I'm


learning
 a
 lot
 here.
 It's
 like
 in
 how
 to


have
 fulfilling
 casual
 sex
 is
 understand


your
 reasons
 for
 going
 into
 this


experience.
 Have
 a
 much
 richer


understanding
 of
 consent.
 Not
 just


physical
 but
 also
 emotional,


situational.
 Um
 and
 then
 really
 try
 to


make
 the
 woman
 come
 because
 if
 you
 do


[laughter]


then
 she
 will
 love
 it
 too.


>> Exactly.
 If
 there's
 one
 takeaway,


[laughter]


make
 sure
 the
 woman
 comes.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


[music]


>> [music]


[music]


>> Okay,
 so
 casual
 sex
 is
 one
 context
 that


someone
 could
 be
 having
 sex.
 Another


context,
 and
 of
 course
 there
 are,
 you


know,
 many
 shades
 of
 context
 in
 between,


but
 then
 we
 have
 the
 sort
 of
 opposite


end
 of
 the
 spectrum,
 which
 is
 a


long-term


relationship,
 right?
 And
 I
 and
 if


someone's
 listening
 and
 they
 are
 in
 a


long-term
 relationship
 where
 the
 sex
 the


sexual
 spark
 has
 faded,
 if
 not


completely
 gone
 out,


what
 would
 you
 recommend
 they
 do
 to


reignite
 that
 spark?


>> So
 there's
 sort
 of
 two
 main
 areas
 that
 I


would
 advise
 couples
 to
 look
 at,
 right?


one
 is
 the
 the
 actual
 types
 of
 sex
 that


they're
 having
 as
 well
 as
 the
 more


relational
 variables.
 So
 if
 we
 start


with
 the
 types
 of
 sex,
 right,


we
 can
 look
 at
 studies
 that
 have
 been


done
 of,
 you
 know,
 thousands
 and


thousands
 of
 of
 couples
 who
 have
 been


interviewed
 and
 asked,
 you
 know,
 first


of
 all,
 how
 sexually
 satisfied
 are
 you


in
 your
 relationship?
 [snorts]


>> And
 tell
 us
 what
 you
 do
 during
 sex,


right?
 Like


>> this
 is
 a
 cool
 kind
 of
 science
 I
 didn't


know
 existed.
 [laughter]
 Yeah.


>> Exactly.
 I
 it's
 like
 what
 sex
 researcher


dreams
 are
 made
 of,
 right?
 [laughter]


And
 so
 it
 comes
 down
 to,
 you
 know,


there's
 sort
 of
 five
 major
 variables


that
 they
 that
 they
 identify.
 Um,
 and


they're
 they're
 kind
 of
 like
 all
 over


the
 place
 in
 terms
 of
 um
 in
 terms
 of
 the


the
 aspects
 they're
 drawing
 from.


>> The
 first
 one
 is
 set
 the
 mood.
 Don't


just
 expect
 yourself
 to
 go
 from
 all


those
 work
 emails
 to
 jumping
 into
 bed


and
 having
 amazing
 sex,
 right?
 Set
 the


mood
 is,
 you
 know,
 both
 for
 yourself


internally,
 but
 also
 whether
 it
 is,
 you


know,
 all
 the
 things
 that
 you
 might


think
 of
 with
 setting
 the
 mood,
 lighting


candles,
 [snorts]
 lowering
 the
 lights.


But
 here's
 something
 that
 was
 really


kind
 of
 adorable
 that
 [laughter]


is
 lovely.
 And
 take
 with
 this


information
 what
 you
 will.
 You're


allowed
 to
 just
 ignore
 it
 if
 you
 are


listening
 to
 this
 podcast
 and
 this
 makes


you
 go
 vomit.


>> Yeah.
 [laughter]


>> Yeah.


>> But
 couples
 who
 say
 I
 love
 you
 during


sex
 are
 actually
 I
 know.


>> I
 mean
 I
 like
 that.
 [laughter]
 And
 also


I
 I
 think
 I
 remember
 this
 in
 your
 book


kissing
 right?
 Kissing
 is
 an
 kissing
 we


don't
 kiss
 our
 partners
 enough
 right
 and


kissing
 during
 sex
 increases
 the
 chances


of
 orgasm
 particularly
 for
 women.


Researchers
 think
 it's
 because
 if
 you're


kissing,
 it's
 likely
 slowing
 the
 pace
 of


sex
 and
 increasing
 emotional
 intimacy,


which
 are
 two
 things
 that
 tend
 to
 be


more
 conducive
 to
 orgasm
 for
 women.
 Um,


but
 by
 the
 way,
 kissing
 when
 you're
 not


having
 sex,
 it's
 not
 tied
 to
 sexual


satisfaction,
 but
 it
 does
 predict


relationship
 satisfaction,
 which
 goes
 to


the
 point
 that
 sex
 should
 not
 be
 the


only
 time
 that
 you're
 touching
 your


partner,
 right?
 You
 should
 be
 engaging


in
 affectionate
 nonsexual
 touch
 as
 well.


going
 back
 to
 this,
 you
 know,
 these


variables.
 So,
 setting
 the
 mood.


>> Setting
 the
 mood.


>> Okay.
 Setting
 the
 mood.
 Also,
 [snorts]


perhaps
 not
 surprisingly,
 prioritize


orgasm.
 Right
 now,


>> we
 just
 talked
 about
 that.
 Yes,


>> we
 talked
 about
 that.
 This
 one's
 a


little
 bit
 nuanced
 because
 when
 you


really
 dig
 into
 the
 data,
 it's
 not
 the


case
 that
 you
 have
 to
 have
 an
 orgasm
 in


order
 to
 have
 an
 amazing
 sexual


experience.
 And
 Anna,
 I
 am
 probably


guessing
 that
 like
 me
 during
 your
 single


years,
 [laughter]
 you
 can
 think
 of


instances
 where
 you
 had
 an
 orgasm
 and


the
 sex
 was
 meh
 and
 where
 you
 had
 an


amazing
 sexual
 experience
 and
 didn't


have
 an
 orgasm.
 Totally.
 Yes.
 Right.
 And


so
 [snorts]
 there
 needs
 to
 be,
 you
 know,


again,
 this
 goes
 back
 to
 widening
 our


definition
 of
 what
 sex
 is.
 It's
 not
 just


penetration.
 It
 involves
 a
 whole
 range


of
 activities.
 And
 so
 it
 is,
 you
 know,


there
 are
 plenty
 of
 times
 when
 maybe
 one


partner
 is
 turned
 on
 and
 the
 other
 is,


you
 know,
 sort
 of
 into
 it.
 And
 so,
 you


know,
 [snorts]
 one
 partner
 uses
 their


vibrator
 on
 the
 other
 partner
 or
 you


give
 your
 partner
 a
 hand
 job
 and
 there's


kissing
 and
 connection
 and
 making
 out


and
 it's
 playful


>> and
 those
 can
 be
 those
 can
 be
 really


sexually
 satisfying.
 And
 then
 there's


>> when
 you
 reciprocate
 the
 next
 week,


right?
 And
 maybe
 it's,
 you
 know,
 you


switch
 turns.
 And
 it's
 just


acknowledging
 that
 we're
 not
 always


going
 to
 be
 perfectly
 synced
 with
 our


partners.
 And
 that's
 okay,
 right?
 It's


okay.


>> However,
 right,
 if
 orgasm
 is
 always


happening
 for
 one
 partner,
 but
 not
 the


other.


>> Something
 to
 examine.
 Something
 to


examine.
 Something
 to
 examine.


>> There's
 color
 in
 that.
 So,
 it's
 set
 the


mood.
 Prioritize
 orgasm
 with
 this
 sort


of
 dimensionality
 that
 you're
 What
 is


the
 third?


>> Communicate.
 which
 we've
 talked
 about


using
 these
 phrases.
 Guide
 me
 is
 my
 my


favorite
 one.


>> I
 really
 [laughter]
 like
 that.
 I
 really


like
 that.


>> Right.
 It's
 hot.
 Show
 me.
 Right.


Exactly.
 Moans,
 size
 again.
 Make
 noise


during
 sex.
 [snorts]


>> Then
 switch
 things
 up.
 Now,
 this
 one
 we


hear
 all
 the
 time.
 Novelty.
 Novelty.


Novelty.
 Okay.
 But
 of
 course,


>> you
 know,
 we
 all
 love
 goals.
 How
 how


much
 novelty,
 right?
 like,
 "Do
 I
 need
 to


be
 doing
 something
 totally
 different


every
 time
 we
 have
 sex?"
 And
 the
 answer


is
 no.
 Of
 course
 not.


Collective
 sigh
 of
 relief.
 If
 you
 want
 a


number,
 right,
 for
 those
 of
 you
 who
 like


love
 to
 hit
 your
 targets,
 [laughter]


okay,
 data
 shows
 that
 couples
 who
 try
 to


do
 something
 new
 once
 a
 month
 or
 more,


right?
 Once
 a
 month,
 right,
 tends
 to
 be


that
 that
 threshold.


>> I
 love
 that
 there's
 actual
 data
 for


this.
 I
 know


>> it's
 it's
 one
 so
 it's
 one
 time
 a
 week


for
 couples


>> frequency
 and
 then
 it's
 one
 time
 a
 month


to
 try
 something
 new


>> but
 here
 I
 mean
 of
 course
 you
 anticipate


this
 question
 but
 how
 novelty


>> what
 is
 novelty
 yes
 exactly
 so
 I
 love
 to


discuss
 this
 idea
 of
 micro
 novelty


because
 it
 does
 not
 need
 to
 mean
 that


you're
 going
 to
 a
 you
 know
 sex
 shop
 and


buying
 a
 bunch
 of
 leather
 and


>> straight
 into
 shabari
 you
 know
 role


Yeah,
 [laughter]
 totally.


>> Exactly.
 It
 can
 be.
 That's
 fantastic
 if


you
 want
 to
 try
 that.
 But
 it
 can
 be
 as


subtle
 as
 instead
 of
 missionary,
 lifted


missionary.


>> Tell
 us.
 I
 think
 I
 know
 what
 it
 is,
 but


just
 to
 put
 a
 fine
 point
 on
 it.
 Lifted


missionary
 is


>> Okay.
 So,
 there's
 sort
 of
 two
 ways
 to


achieve
 it.
 It
 is
 missionary
 as
 you


might
 imagine.
 It
 is
 you
 put
 a
 you
 have


two
 ways
 to
 do
 it.
 You
 can
 either
 put
 a


pillow
 underneath
 the
 woman's
 hips
 or


her
 legs
 around
 her
 partner's
 neck,


which
 is
 going
 to
 elevate
 the
 pelvis


into
 an
 angle
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 more


pleasurable
 and
 more
 likely
 to
 lead
 to


orgasm
 for
 her,
 increasing
 surface
 area


of
 the
 places
 that
 feel
 the
 best
 for


her.


>> And
 so
 this
 is
 an
 example
 of
 switching


it
 up
 just
 slightly,
 right?
 What's


another
 example?
 I
 really
 like
 this.


What's
 another
 example
 of
 micro
 novelty?


So
 trying
 out
 maybe
 you
 have
 tried
 woman


on
 top


>> but
 maybe
 what
 you
 should
 try
 is
 woman


on
 top
 but
 having
 your
 chest
 against


your
 partner.


>> I
 mean
 these
 are
 all
 amazing
 these
 are


all
 amazing
 you
 know
 positions
 to
 try


out
 too
 but
 I
 assume
 there's
 also
 micro


novelty
 in
 terms
 of
 outside
 of


positions.
 Yeah.


>> Oh
 my
 god
 there's
 so
 much
 micro
 novelty


be beyond
 positions
 right.
 It
 could
 be


having
 sex
 in
 a
 different
 room,
 having


sex
 while
 you're
 on
 vacation,
 having
 sex


at
 a
 different
 time
 of
 day
 than
 you


normally
 do,
 [gasps]
 having
 sex
 that
 is


with
 all
 the
 lights
 on,
 having
 sex
 with


that's
 with
 the
 lights
 off.
 Having
 you
 I


mean
 it
 could
 be


>> roleplay
 probably,
 although
 is
 that


micro
 novelty?
 That
 feels
 a
 bit
 like


macro
 novelty.


>> I
 would
 categorize
 that
 more
 as
 pilling


at
 the
 big
 guns.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 true.
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about


those
 those
 sort
 of
 bigger
 jumps
 in


terms
 of
 spice
 level,
 but
 one
 thing
 I


want
 to
 bring
 us
 back
 to
 is
 you
 spoke


about
 this
 idea
 in
 long-term


relationships
 of
 how
 beneficial
 it
 can


be
 to
 planned
 sex.
 And
 I'm
 trying
 to


holding
 these
 two
 things,
 novelty
 and


planned
 sex,
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 Talk
 to


me
 about
 how
 those
 two
 things
 can


coexist
 because
 they
 seem
 maybe


potentially
 contradictory.
 Right.


>> Right.
 Exactly.
 Exactly.
 And
 here
 I
 just


want
 everyone
 to
 consider
 you
 know
 two


things.
 First
 of
 all
 again
 going
 back
 to


the
 data
 when
 we
 look
 at
 couples
 who
 you


know
 when
 we
 ask
 them
 at
 the
 beginning


of
 the
 study
 which
 do
 you
 think
 is


hotter
 planned
 sex
 or
 spontaneous
 sex?


Of
 course
 everyone
 is
 like
 oh
 obviously


spontaneous
 sex
 like
 it
 has
 to
 be


planned.
 That's
 robbing
 it
 of
 of


excitement
 and
 pleasure.
 But
 when
 you


ask
 them
 to
 keep
 daily
 diary
 studies
 and


explain
 how
 hot
 and
 enjoyable
 the
 sexual


experience
 was,
 guess
 what?
 [snorts]


It's
 just
 as
 pleasurable
 when
 it's


planned.


>> And
 that
 is
 data
 proven.
 It's
 like


>> datadriven
 binding.
 Exactly.
 And
 it's


the
 perfect
 pathway


>> into
 introducing
 these
 different
 types


of
 micro
 novelty.
 Right.
 Because
 you


have
 time
 to
 think
 about
 what
 might
 be


fun
 to
 try,
 to
 anticipate
 what
 might
 be


different,
 to
 fantasize,
 to
 get
 ideas,


to
 to
 send
 a,
 you
 know,
 a
 sex
 earlier
 in


the
 day
 to
 your
 partner
 that
 can
 be
 as,


you
 know,
 wholesome
 as,
 you
 know,


looking
 forward
 to
 tonight
 fireflame
 to


something
 that
 I
 probably
 shouldn't


mention
 on
 a
 New
 York
 Times
 [laughter]


podcast,
 right?


>> We've
 crossed
 some
 lines
 before,
 but


yeah,
 it's
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 I
 like
 this.


It's
 like
 planned
 sex.
 It
 just
 kind
 of


needs
 a
 rebrand,
 right?
 Because


>> a
 new
 public.


>> Yeah,
 it
 does.
 Because
 planned
 makes
 it


sound
 wrote,
 boring,
 routine,
 just


another
 item
 on
 the
 to-do
 list.
 But


instead,
 this
 is
 a
 regular


>> erotic
 space
 where
 you
 can
 explore
 and


be
 explored
 and
 try
 new
 things
 and
 and


and
 look
 forward
 to
 it.
 I
 mean,


>> yes,


>> this
 is
 something
 that
 um
 what
 if
 the


sort
 of
 the
 the
 the
 planned
 sex
 time


comes,
 it's,
 you
 know,
 9:00
 p.m.
 on
 a


Thursday,
 whatever
 you've
 decided,
 and


you're
 just
 not
 into
 it.
 Like,
 you've


talked
 about
 how
 someone
 can
 warm
 up
 a


partner,
 but
 to
 me,
 it's
 like,
 yeah,
 it


it
 feels
 to
 me
 like
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 tricky


line
 if
 you're
 just
 really
 not
 feeling


it.
 What
 What
 would
 you
 say
 in
 that
 kind


of
 situation?
 The
 the
 planned
 sex
 time


comes
 and
 it's
 just
 it's
 not
 for
 you.


Normalize
 rescheduling.
 [laughter]


>> Okay,
 great.
 Yeah,
 but
 really


rescheduling.


>> Yes,
 but
 really
 rescheduling.
 Put


another
 date
 on
 the
 calendar.


>> I
 recommend
 the
 next
 night.
 Right
 now,


you
 know,
 of
 course
 there's
 there's


limits
 to
 that,
 right?
 I
 mean,
 if
 you


find
 that
 it's
 reschedule,
 reschedule,


rejection,
 rejection,
 that
 that
 never


feels
 good
 to
 anyone,
 right?
 And
 that's


when
 we
 can
 get
 into
 sort
 of
 these


larger,
 you
 know,
 relational
 aspects


that
 might
 be
 impacting,
 you
 know,
 your


level
 of
 desire
 in
 the
 relationship.
 Um,


but
 rescheduling
 is
 fine.
 You
 know,
 I


mean,
 think
 about
 that.
 We
 reschedule


other
 things
 in
 our
 life.
 Just
 don't


reschedule
 for
 two
 months
 away,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 [laughter]


>> We
 I
 have
 a
 48
 hour
 rule.
 I
 would
 say


that


>> and
 this
 is
 maybe
 that's
 not
 D's
 room,


but
 that's
 a
 Dr.
 You
 know,
 Nicole


>> McNichols.
 Exactly.
 [laughter]


>> Planning
 sex.
 I
 mean,
 maybe
 this
 is


obvious,
 but
 it
 makes
 it
 a
 priority.
 I'm


just
 thinking
 about
 all
 the
 stuff
 that's


on
 my
 calendar
 that's
 like
 take
 out


trash,
 like
 stuff
 or
 I
 don't
 know,
 like,


you
 know,
 laundry,
 and
 it's
 these
 things


are
 way
 less
 fun
 than
 sex,
 and
 yet
 they


have
 a
 place
 on
 my
 calendar,
 right?
 Um,


and
 so,
 yeah,
 giving
 it


>> the
 importance,
 the
 import
 that
 it


deserves.
 Just
 to
 go
 back
 to
 this
 idea


of
 of
 of
 novelty.
 If
 someone
 is


interested
 in
 in
 introducing
 novelty,
 be


it,
 you
 know,
 micro
 novelty
 like
 we


talked
 about
 or
 some
 of
 these
 bigger


swings
 like
 we're
 discussing,


how
 would
 you
 recommend
 they
 bring
 this


up
 to
 a
 partner?
 I
 always
 lean
 into


the
 very
 basic
 fact
 that
 we
 all
 tend
 to


do
 better
 with
 positive
 reinforcement


than
 negative
 reinforcement.
 So
 I
 would


say
 tonight


>> have
 a
 conversation
 with
 your
 partner


>> where
 you
 ask
 them
 what
 is
 the
 best
 sex


we've
 ever
 had,
 right?
 And
 marinate
 in


that.
 Talk
 about
 that.
 Right?
 Usually


when
 you
 talk
 about
 that
 incredible
 sex


that
 you've
 had
 and
 what
 was
 really


amazing
 about
 it,
 your
 [snorts]
 brain


naturally
 is
 going
 to
 a
 place
 of
 what


comes
 next,
 right?
 How
 do
 we
 take
 that


thing
 that
 turned
 us
 on
 in
 that
 moment


that
 led
 to
 that
 sexual
 experience
 being


so
 incredible
 that
 we
 can
 now
 build
 on


that?
 Right?


>> Maybe
 we
 enjoyed
 light
 spanking
 and
 we


want
 to
 try,
 you
 know,
 a
 paddle.


[laughter]


>> Yeah.


Maybe
 it
 was
 that
 we
 were
 in
 a
 hotel


room
 on
 vacation.
 Maybe
 we
 want
 to
 try


going
 to
 dinner
 and
 going
 to
 a
 hotel


room
 in
 the
 city
 in
 which
 we
 live.
 Who


says
 you
 can't
 say
 it
 to,
 you
 know,
 m
 in


other
 words,
 there
 are
 ways
 to


in,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 it
 was
 that
 it
 was


you
 had
 sex
 before
 you
 went
 out
 to


dinner
 instead
 of
 after.
 Yeah.
 Right.


Because
 you
 weren't
 didn't
 come
 home
 and


feel
 full
 and
 you
 know,
 [laughter]


perhaps
 drunk
 alcohol.


>> Build
 to
 it.
 I
 like
 that.
 grounding
 it


in
 the
 positives
 and
 then
 saying,
 "Well,


what
 can
 we
 do
 to
 build
 from
 this


foundation?"


>> Exactly.
 That
 positive
 is
 your
 launching


point
 and
 you
 use
 your
 sense
 of


curiosity
 to
 go
 from
 there.


>> Exactly.


>> And
 I
 like
 that
 you
 said
 tonight
 cuz
 you


can
 do
 that
 tonight.
 You
 can,
 you
 know,


those
 listening,


>> you
 know,
 I
 wonder
 if
 there
 is
 sort
 of
 a


I
 don't
 know.
 I'm
 I'm
 sort
 of
 like


becoming
 a
 mantra
 person,
 which
 is


unexpected
 for
 me,
 but
 I
 [laughter]
 sort


of
 am.
 Let's
 just
 be
 honest.
 And
 I


wonder
 if
 you
 have
 a
 sort
 of
 mantra
 or


rallying
 cry
 or
 whatever
 you
 want
 to
 say


that
 we
 could
 keep
 in
 mind
 if
 someone


listening
 does
 want
 to
 start
 tonight


does
 want
 to
 begin
 the
 work
 the
 joyful


fun
 flirty
 work
 of
 having
 better
 sex.


What's
 a
 what's
 what's
 a
 mantra
 we
 can


hold
 on
 to?


>> Own
 your
 pleasure.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 it
 really
 is
 about
 owning


your
 own
 particular


brand
 of
 what
 makes
 you
 come
 to
 a
 sexual


situation,
 feeling
 empowered
 to
 show
 up,


assert
 your
 own
 needs,
 communicate,
 and


have
 a
 mutually
 pleasurable
 experience.


And
 it's
 really
 about
 taking
 ownership,


right?
 Taking
 that
 responsibility
 into


your
 own
 hands
 and
 knowing
 that
 you
 have


the
 power
 to
 do
 it.


>> I
 knew
 you'd
 have
 a
 mantra.
 I
 knew
 you'd


have
 a
 mantra
 right
 there,
 right
 at
 the


front,
 Dr.
 Nicole
 McNichols.
 A,
 I
 meant


it
 about
 you
 saving
 me
 a
 spot
 in
 your


class.


>> Done.


>> B.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 this


conversation.
 I
 really
 appreciate
 it.


>> Anna,
 this
 was
 such
 a
 delight.
 Thank
 you


so
 much
 for
 having
 me.
