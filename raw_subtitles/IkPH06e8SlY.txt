Hello
 OddLots
 listeners.
 You
 are


listening
 to
 another
 special
 episode
 of


the
 podcast.
 It
 was
 recorded
 in
 New
 York


City
 on
 July
 26th.
 In
 this
 uh


conversation,
 we
 talked
 to
 Emily
 Sunberg


of
 the
 FeedMe
 newsletter.
 We
 are
 talking


about
 how
 Gen
 Z
 sees
 the
 world,
 how
 they


think
 about
 capitalism,
 how
 they
 think


about
 money,
 how
 they
 think
 about


investing,
 how
 they
 think
 about
 spending


it,
 and
 how
 they
 think
 about
 how
 nobody


is
 coming
 to
 save
 them.
 That's
 right.
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 a
 secret
 at
 this
 point


that
 Gen
 Z
 seems
 to
 love
 uh
 stock
 market


investing
 and
 things
 like
 that,
 trying


to
 make
 money.
 So,
 take
 a
 listen.
 First


question
 been
 on
 my
 mind
 the
 last
 couple


of
 days.
 you
 have
 a
 very
 like
 young


plugged
 in
 like
 sort
 of
 business


capitalism
 audience.
 What
 percentage
 of


your
 readers
 do
 you
 think
 voted
 for
 uh


Zoron?
 Um
 a
 young
 man,
 I
 think
 he
 was


19,
 a
 Yale
 student
 emailed
 me
 this


morning
 and
 asked
 if
 I
 could
 put
 that


poll
 in
 my
 newsletter
 and
 I
 I
 didn't.
 It


felt
 a
 little
 late,
 but
 I
 should
 have.


I'm
 guessing
 65%


cautiously
 like
 Yeah.
 Hm.
 Can
 you
 maybe


describe
 your
 sort
 of
 average
 reader


just
 for
 people
 who
 might
 not
 be
 aware


like
 what
 population
 are
 you
 plugged


into
 here?
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 any
 of


you
 use
 Substack,
 but
 they
 don't
 give


you
 these
 analytics.
 So,
 all
 of
 my
 data


about
 my
 readership
 has
 been
 quite


anecdotal
 from
 just
 looking
 at
 people's


profiles
 in
 the
 comment
 section
 and


seeing
 who
 shows
 up
 to
 my
 parties.
 But,


do
 any
 of
 you
 read
 it?
 Like
 if
 I
 do.


Okay.
 So,
 some
 of
 that's
 some
 my


audience.
 I
 like
 to
 say
 that
 my


readership
 is
 everyone
 from
 bartenders


to
 billionaires,
 but
 I
 would
 say
 like
 if


you're
 paying
 $80
 a
 year
 for
 a


newsletter,
 then
 you're
 probably
 making


a
 decent
 amount
 of
 money
 or
 you're
 at


least
 interested
 in
 making
 money.
 And
 I


think
 it's
 a
 mostly
 New
 York
 audience,


30
 to
 45ish.


But
 if
 you
 come
 to
 my
 parties,
 you'll


see
 who
 else
 there
 is.
 But
 I
 I
 would
 say


like
 people
 interested
 in
 in
 making


money
 and
 somewhat
 interested
 in
 New


York
 City
 business
 and
 culture.
 So
 the


first
 time
 several
 tries
 to
 get
 you
 on


the
 podcast,
 but
 finally
 making
 it


happen.
 And
 I
 wanted
 to
 talk
 about
 like


Gen
 Z
 and
 capitalism
 because
 I
 feel
 like


millennials
 and
 maybe
 Gen
 X,
 but


millennials
 in
 particular
 like
 sort
 of


had
 this
 lovehate
 relation,
 like
 sort
 of


apologized
 for
 wanting
 money,
 sort
 of


ambivalent
 about
 it.
 And
 I
 get
 the


impression
 that
 the
 younger
 generation


is
 like
 much
 more
 comfortable
 with
 like,


yeah,
 we
 want
 to
 make
 a
 ton
 of
 money.


And
 so
 I'm
 like
 curious.
 Yeah.
 So
 talk


about
 if
 that's
 correct,
 this


perception.
 I
 think
 one
 thing
 that's


very
 clear
 about
 Gen
 Z
 is
 that
 they've


repeatedly
 been
 told
 nobody
 is
 coming
 to


save
 you.
 You're
 going
 to
 graduate
 into


a
 job
 market
 that
 barely
 exists.
 And
 if


you
 get
 a
 job,
 you
 might
 not
 even
 have
 a


desk
 or
 an
 office
 to
 go
 into.
 A
 lot
 of


them
 were
 home
 during
 COVID
 and
 they're


also
 seeing
 like
 shootings
 in
 schools


all
 the
 time
 and
 they're
 seeing
 their


capital
 getting
 sworn
 like
 they're
 it's


nobody's
 coming
 to
 save
 them
 and
 it's


sort
 of
 up
 to
 them
 to
 make
 the
 most
 of


this
 world
 while
 it's
 still
 in


existence.
 And
 you
 hear
 this
 sense
 of


like
 get
 the
 bag
 while
 the
 world
 is


still
 here
 for
 you
 to
 make
 some
 money


out
 of
 it.
 What
 was
 your
 question?


No,
 that
 was
 basically
 it.
 Like
 that's


like
 an
 overwhelming
 sentiment
 that
 I


hear
 from
 from
 these
 people.
 Yeah.
 I


think
 it
 was
 like
 some
 survey
 and
 they


they
 asked
 all
 the
 generations
 like
 what


do
 you
 need
 to
 have
 a
 good
 life?
 And
 it


was
 something
 like
 $70,000
 whatever
 and


then
 Jenzie
 was
 like
 $500,000
 salary
 or


something
 like
 that.
 Yeah.
 I
 I
 mean


you're
 even
 seeing
 like
 if
 you're
 a


creator
 even
 at
 like
 Goldman
 Sachs,


you're
 probably
 making
 more
 money
 as


like
 making
 day
 in
 the
 life
 Tik
 Toks


than
 you
 are
 from
 your
 salary.
 And
 like


there's
 this
 growing
 creator
 economy
 and


your
 role
 model
 might
 be
 somebody
 who's


like
 made
 millions
 and
 millions
 of


dollars
 a
 year
 from
 humiliating


themselves
 online.
 And
 like
 there's
 all


these
 possibilities
 and
 tools
 from


entering
 the
 creator
 economy.
 Like
 I


think
 Bloomberg
 published
 a
 story
 last


week
 that
 even
 just
 the
 market
 for


creator
 marketing
 is
 like
 $33
 billion


now.
 It's
 massive.
 This
 idea
 that
 no


one's
 coming
 to
 save
 you.
 We've
 talked


about
 this
 on
 an
 episode
 before,
 but
 it


does
 feel
 like
 that
 kind
 of
 translates


into
 people
 making
 these
 lottery
 ticket


type
 bets,
 right?
 So,
 I'll
 buy
 into


crypto
 or
 I'll
 make
 a
 ridiculous
 options


trade
 or
 something
 like
 that
 and
 hope


that
 I
 just
 get
 lucky
 and
 save
 myself.


Mhm.
 Yeah.
 I
 I
 think
 like
 something
 with


crypto,
 there's
 this
 online
 sort
 of


sportsmanship
 and
 camaraderie
 around
 it


as
 well.
 So
 there's
 like
 this
 fun


competition
 and
 making
 the
 money
 and


it's
 all
 very
 public
 as
 well
 to
 me.
 Like


you're
 seeing
 how
 much
 your
 peers
 are


making
 and
 winning
 and
 you're
 almost


like
 seeing
 how
 much
 they're
 taking
 home


each
 week
 which
 is
 stressful.
 How
 much


of
 the
 um
 nobody
 is
 coming
 to
 save
 you


mentality
 is
 like
 AI
 dread.
 Like
 jobs
 as


we
 know
 them
 might
 not
 exist.
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 it.
 Yeah.
 Say
 more.
 I
 mean,
 back


to
 this
 idea
 that
 say
 you
 graduate
 from


college
 last
 week
 on
 a
 100
 degree
 day


and
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 job
 lined
 up
 yet,


or
 maybe
 you
 do
 have
 a
 job
 lined
 up
 and


you're
 entering
 a
 very
 flat
 company


where
 there's
 not
 like
 a
 clear
 ladder


for
 you
 to
 climb.
 And
 not
 only
 is
 your


timeline
 there,
 it
 probably
 feels


somewhat
 flat,
 but
 the
 end
 is
 like


whether
 you're
 a
 copywriter
 or
 if
 you're


working
 in
 finance,
 there's
 like
 the
 end


of
 it
 might
 be
 a
 replacement
 with
 mass


layoffs
 and
 AI
 coming
 in
 to
 take
 that


job.
 I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 a
 completely


self-interested
 question,
 but
 does
 Gen
 Z


truly
 hate
 the
 millennial
 generation?
 Is


that
 a
 real
 thing?
 I'm
 not
 Gen
 Z.
 So


like
 I'm
 not
 like
 the
 speaker
 of
 the


generation.
 I'm
 I
 guess
 maybe
 how
 I'm
 30


so


but
 I
 never
 identified
 as
 Jenz
 I'm


definitely
 identify
 more
 with


millennials.
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 truly


hate
 millennials.
 I
 don't
 think
 that's


the
 case.
 I
 think
 that
 there's
 like
 a


lot
 of
 parts
 about
 there's
 like
 this


tweess
 to
 millennials
 that
 is
 like


cringey,
 but
 that's
 fair.
 I
 agree.
 Yeah.


I'm
 really
 actually
 um
 I've
 actually


been
 thinking
 about
 this
 phenomenon
 of


like
 really
 flat
 companies
 for
 a
 while.


So
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 like
 really


interesting
 that
 you
 said
 that
 because


it
 really
 feels
 like
 and
 we
 actually
 did


an
 episode
 recently
 with
 the
 economist


Ricardo
 Houseman
 where
 he
 sort
 of
 talked


about
 like
 companies
 their
 structure
 is


just
 they
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 people


who
 are
 like
 the
 talent
 but
 it
 doesn't


feel
 like
 they're
 just
 sort
 of
 normal


jobs
 at
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 for
 people


who
 are
 just
 sort
 of
 normal
 to
 get.


Yeah.
 I
 worked
 at
 Meta
 for
 a
 few
 years


and
 there
 there
 were
 like
 these
 Roman


numerals
 next
 to
 your
 position
 and
 you


knew
 how
 much
 everybody
 at
 the
 company


was
 making
 if
 they
 were
 like
 a
 three
 or


a
 five
 and
 when
 you
 moved
 from
 a
 four
 to


a
 five
 it
 was
 like
 $20,000
 more
 like
 not


life-changing
 like
 maybe
 you're
 taking


an
 extra
 few
 Ubers
 like
 a
 year
 or


something
 like
 that
 and
 it
 felt
 very


flat
 like
 and
 it's
 also
 hard
 to
 look
 at


somebody
 who
 you're
 working
 with
 who's


two
 levels
 higher
 than
 you
 and


necessarily
 aspire
 to
 that
 like
 you're


not
 going
 to
 stay
 an
 extra
 2
 hours
 at


night.
 It
 It's
 not
 inspiring.
 So,
 just


going
 back
 to
 Mum
 Donnie.
 So,
 one
 of
 the


theories
 about
 why
 he's
 kind
 of


resonating
 with
 the
 younger
 crowd


nowadays
 is
 this
 idea
 that,
 okay,
 they


don't
 really
 have
 a
 stake
 in
 capitalism


necessarily,
 like
 they
 don't
 feel
 like


they're
 being
 rewarded
 by
 the
 capitalist


system
 and
 so
 they're
 voting
 for
 change.


Is
 that
 something
 you
 kind
 of
 observe
 in


your
 day-to-day
 interactions?
 Well,
 I


work
 alone,
 so
 I'm
 not
 like
 observing


many
 interactions
 from
 people,
 but
 like


online,
 I
 think
 like
 the
 people
 who


gravitated
 towards
 him
 the
 strongest


felt
 more
 relig
 like
 hope
 like
 it
 it
 was


like
 this
 idea
 of
 hope
 and
 something


different
 and
 it
 was
 like
 a
 salve
 after


such
 a
 rough
 beginning
 of
 the
 year
 with


like
 Trump
 coming
 into
 the
 White
 House.


But
 yeah,
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 think
 it
 was
 it


felt
 more
 emotional
 and
 almost
 religious


to
 me
 than
 like
 at
 least
 from
 like
 what


I've
 been
 observing
 and
 and
 and
 why


people
 attach
 themselves
 to
 that
 message


so
 strongly.
 What
 about
 um
 we
 were


talking
 about
 okay
 you
 have
 this
 desire


to
 get
 the
 bag,
 make
 a
 bunch
 of
 money


and
 like
 a
 lottery
 ticket
 metaphorically


with
 crypto
 or
 whatever.
 How
 does
 this


uh
 mentality
 how
 would
 you
 say
 it


changes
 consumption
 patterns
 and
 like


the
 impulse
 to
 just
 like
 save
 or
 like


how
 does
 it
 affect
 what
 people
 buy?


That's
 a
 good
 question.
 I
 was
 talking
 to


a
 friend
 the
 other
 day
 who
 said
 that
 she


was
 at
 her
 younger
 sister's
 graduation


on
 the
 West
 Coast
 and
 all
 of
 the
 young


women
 were
 wearing
 Gucci
 sandals
 like


all
 of
 them
 at
 this
 school.
 It
 was
 in


the
 Bay
 Area
 and
 she's
 10
 years
 older


than
 her
 sister
 and
 she
 was
 like,
 "This


is
 not
 something
 that
 I
 witnessed."
 And


it's
 not
 like
 everyone
 there
 is
 loaded


to
 afford
 this
 this
 like
 specific


sandal.
 And
 I
 know
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 you


might
 have
 read
 that
 story
 in
 New
 York


magazine
 a
 few
 weeks
 ago
 about
 the
 West


Village
 and
 this
 sort
 of
 homogeneous


looking
 young
 person
 in
 New
 York
 City.


And
 I'm
 realizing
 that
 that's
 kind
 of
 a


phenomenon
 across
 the
 whole
 country.


It's
 like
 everyone
 is
 wearing
 the
 same,


buying
 the
 same,
 like
 fitting
 into
 this


and
 millennials
 back
 to
 that.
 It's
 like


everybody
 wanted
 to
 do
 their
 own
 thing


and
 listen
 to
 their
 own
 music
 and
 and


have
 their
 own
 style
 and
 have
 their
 own


Tumblr,
 whatever.
 Like
 it
 was
 annoying.


It
 was
 annoying,
 but
 it
 it
 it
 created


like
 diversity
 of
 opinions
 and
 the


ability
 to
 have
 like
 small
 shows
 that


sold
 out
 and
 stuff
 and
 small
 brands
 that


existed
 and
 small
 stores
 that
 existed,


but
 and
 I
 haven't
 fully
 baked
 out
 the


thought,
 but
 I
 started
 realizing
 it
 like


a
 week
 ago,
 like
 the
 West
 Village
 thing


has
 quickly
 turned
 into
 like
 if
 you
 live


in
 the
 in
 a
 flyover
 state
 or
 you
 live
 in


the
 West
 Village,
 you
 might
 be
 wearing


the
 same
 exact
 outfit
 and
 be
 just
 as


obsessed
 with
 like
 the
 matcha
 thing,


whatever.


So
 that's
 like
 definitely
 part
 of
 the


consumption
 conversation.
 It's
 like


you're
 checking
 off
 boxes
 of
 of
 like


small
 things
 that
 you're
 buying,
 whether


it's
 at
 Starbucks
 or
 Gucci
 to
 like
 kind


of
 form
 this
 perfect
 life
 of
 what
 it


means
 to
 be
 a
 25-year-old.
 And
 like,


okay,
 now
 I'm
 happy
 I
 figured
 that
 out.


Something
 else
 that
 I've
 been
 reading
 a


lot
 about,
 I
 have
 some
 young
 readers
 and


I
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 surveys
 in
 my
 newsletter,


which
 is
 awesome
 that
 my
 readers
 are


even
 willing
 to
 spend
 like
 15
 minutes
 on


that
 cuz
 I
 wouldn't.


There's
 a
 real
 sentiment
 of
 like
 the


world
 is
 burning,
 so
 why
 shouldn't
 we


enjoy
 the
 things
 that
 we
 can?
 And
 I
 I


don't
 know
 what
 the
 savings
 accounts
 of


these
 people
 look
 like
 or
 the
 or
 the


credit
 card
 bills
 look
 like,
 but
 I
 know


that
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 people
 are
 spending


money
 that
 they
 do
 not
 have
 because
 I


understand
 that
 the
 jobs
 that
 usually


facilitate
 that
 are
 a
 lot
 they're
 paying


a
 lot
 more
 than
 what
 these
 young
 people


are
 making.
 And
 I
 imagine
 there's
 a


sense
 that
 I'm
 never
 going
 to
 make


enough
 to
 buy
 a
 house
 or
 something
 like


that.
 And
 then
 there's
 like
 the
 whole


buy
 now
 pay
 later
 conversation
 which
 you


can
 buy
 now
 pay
 later.
 You're
 seamless.


Like
 that's
 crazy.
 Yeah.
 So,
 I
 I
 think


it's
 like
 you
 make
 the
 money,
 you
 spend


the
 money,
 and
 and
 they're
 probably
 not


even
 thinking
 about
 What
 about
 my
 kids?


Because
 that's
 the
 dating
 apps
 don't


even
 work.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 the


kids
 come
 in.
 Now,
 this
 is
 bleak.
 Yeah,


this
 ble
 actually.
 No,
 but
 this
 it's
 I'm


I'm
 enjoying
 this.
 So,


I
 lived
 for
 many
 years
 of
 my
 life
 in


Illinois.
 My
 dad
 was
 a
 uh
 physics


professor
 at
 a
 very
 small
 college.
 And


it
 it
 always
 strikes
 me
 like
 that
 he
 was


totally
 fine
 moving
 to
 a
 fairly
 small


large
 town
 in
 Illinois.
 When
 you
 said


fly
 over
 states,
 is
 there
 this


aspiration
 that
 like
 you
 have
 to
 get
 to


one
 of
 the
 big
 cities
 that
 like
 you
 have


to
 get
 to
 like
 New
 York
 or
 LA
 or
 San


Francisco?
 I
 think
 as
 much
 as
 I
 don't


think
 that's
 like
 a
 new
 thing.
 I
 think


it's
 like


we'll
 we'll
 get
 to
 the
 West
 Village
 like


I
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 everybody
 there's


like
 a
 new
 grind
 to
 do
 that.
 I
 think


that
 there's
 just
 as
 many
 young
 people


in
 New
 York
 living
 with
 four
 roommates


in
 a
 one-bedroom
 with
 like
 weird
 Home


Depot
 walls
 everywhere
 as
 there
 were


when
 I
 was
 young
 where
 they're
 working.


I
 mean,
 the
 three
 of
 us
 are
 all
 like
 in


the
 creator
 economy.
 I'm
 sure
 that


there's
 a
 whole
 micro


group
 of
 young
 people
 doing
 the
 same


trying
 to
 do
 the
 same
 thing.
 We
 are
 in


the
 creator
 economy.


just
 on
 the
 Hey,
 there's
 a
 mic
 in
 front


of
 you.
 This
 is
 What
 else
 are
 we
 doing?


We're
 creating.
 Yeah,
 I
 did.
 Did
 I


disagree?
 No.
 Okay,
 we're
 creators.


Um,
 just
 on
 the
 West
 Village
 girl
 thing


and
 the
 idea
 of
 homogeneity
 among


fashion
 and
 consumerism.
 What
 do
 you


think
 is
 driving
 that?
 Is
 that
 like
 a


lack
 of
 community
 or
 I
 I
 don't
 know.


Like
 that
 was
 one
 of
 the
 most
 shocking


parts
 of
 the
 story
 to
 me.
 Like
 I
 feel
 so


silly.
 If
 there
 was
 one
 person
 in
 this


room
 with
 the
 same
 exact
 outfit
 as
 me,


I'd
 be
 like,
 "Wait
 a
 second."
 Right?


What
 h
 how
 what
 happened?
 Like
 I
 thought


I
 was
 putting
 something
 together.
 Two


white
 pieces
 of
 clothing.
 But
 it
 is
 it's


really
 weird.
 Like
 I
 don't know
 if


you've
 ever
 been
 in
 one
 of
 those
 workout


classes,
 but
 it's
 like
 they
 all
 have


this
 set.
 It's
 I'm
 not
 sure
 what
 it
 is.


I
 have
 to
 do
 some
 research
 because
 it's


an
 extreme
 comfort
 with
 having
 the
 an


identical


And
 I
 think
 part
 of
 it
 is
 probably
 like


the
 Amazon
 storefront
 and
 they're
 all


following
 the
 same
 influencer
 who's


promoting
 the
 same
 product
 and
 everybody


buys
 it
 immediately.
 There
 was
 this


piece
 of
 clothing.
 I
 guess
 it
 was
 a


dress
 um
 from
 from
 Tori
 Burch
 a
 few


weeks
 ago
 and
 I
 posted
 it
 because
 I
 saw


like
 five
 people
 at
 the
 at
 different


weddings
 on
 the
 same
 weekend
 wearing
 it


and
 it's
 a
 very
 distinct
 like
 hot
 pink


dress
 with
 mirrors
 all
 over
 it
 and
 I


said
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 wedding


guest
 dress
 of
 the
 summer.
 Like
 this
 is


going
 to
 be
 everywhere
 and
 it
 sold
 out


the
 next
 day.
 Like
 people
 were
 not
 like


then
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 buy
 it.
 Everyone


bought
 it.
 Like
 everybody
 clicked
 the


link
 and
 then
 bought
 it.
 Like
 there's


this
 I
 think
 when
 you're
 all
 following


the
 same
 people
 and
 the
 same
 brands
 and


having
 the
 same
 excitement
 about
 the


time
 people
 follow
 what
 time
 like


clothing
 drops
 come
 out
 at
 these
 brands


too
 like
 what
 time
 the
 sites
 get


updated.
 There's
 a
 lot
 more
 likelihood


than
 that
 you're
 all
 going
 to
 buy
 the


same
 thing.
 Yeah.
 That's
 really
 weird.


Like
 you'd
 think
 okay
 people
 want
 to
 be


distinct
 but
 I
 remember
 my
 wife
 and
 I


went
 out
 to
 a
 comedy
 show
 a
 couple


months
 ago
 and
 everybody
 was
 dressed
 the


same
 and
 both
 of
 us
 were
 like
 sort
 of


flabbergasted.
 Like
 what
 was
 the
 same?


It
 was
 just
 like
 sort
 of
 black,
 like
 a


sort
 of
 black
 shirt.
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,


it's
 New
 York,
 so
 people
 have
 always


worn
 all
 black,
 but
 it
 was
 really
 weird.


There
 was
 no
 color
 in
 anyone's
 clothes


in
 the
 entire
 audience
 that
 night,
 and


it
 was
 um
 very
 strange.
 How
 much
 do


those
 Gucci
 sandals
 cost?


800?
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 But
 um
 8
 like


a
 lot
 of
 money
 for
 for
 a
 pair
 of
 shoes.


And
 then
 for
 everyone
 to
 feel
 comfort.
 I


mean,
 we
 see
 it
 all
 the
 time
 with
 bags


and
 stuff,
 but
 it
 is
 sort
 of
 funny
 when


it's
 an
 entire
 wardrobe.
 But
 I
 think
 Can


you
 talk
 about
 the
 Birkin?
 What
 What


part
 do
 you
 want
 to
 talk
 about?
 Just


talk
 about
 it.
 Do
 people
 still
 buy


Birkkins
 like
 as
 an
 investment?
 I
 don't


know.
 Bethany
 Frankle
 said
 she
 she's


made
 like
 a
 ton
 of
 money
 on
 flipping
 her


Birkens,
 but
 God
 flipped.
 Yeah,
 she's
 a


flipper.
 She
 did
 she's
 bought
 some
 new


houses,
 too.
 One
 of
 the
 re
 things
 that
 I


always
 like
 reading
 in
 your
 newsletter


is
 like
 you're
 always
 talking
 about
 new


brands
 that
 are
 launching
 new


restaurants
 etc.
 There's
 been
 we
 talk


about
 volatility
 in
 the
 market
 all
 this


uncertainty
 due
 to
 trade
 and
 whatever


else.
 Do
 you
 feel
 any
 slowdown
 at
 all
 in


sort
 of
 new
 entrepreneurial
 endeavors
 on


account
 of
 all
 this
 uncertainty
 that's


going
 on
 or
 is
 it
 just
 like
 people
 just


powering
 through
 it?
 A
 slowdown
 of
 new


economic
 endeavors
 of
 like
 from
 young


people.
 Yeah.
 or
 just
 like
 new
 like
 new


business
 launches.
 Has
 that
 slowed
 down


at
 all
 in
 your
 view
 with
 all
 the


economic
 question
 marks?
 No,
 I
 think


people
 are
 doing
 it
 differently
 though.


I
 don't
 think
 people
 are
 as
 excited
 to


take
 on
 like
 venture
 capital
 and
 they're


more
 likely
 to
 like
 bootstrap
 or
 attach


themselves
 to
 a
 friend
 and
 like
 try


something
 and
 have
 it
 fail
 and
 sort
 of


quietly
 brush
 it
 aside
 and
 be
 like,
 I


didn't
 start
 that
 weird
 vodka
 company


that
 it's
 like
 I
 don't
 do
 that
 anymore.


you
 know,
 where
 I
 think
 like
 I
 can
 speak


to
 the
 girl
 boss
 very
 well.
 Like
 the


girl
 boss
 of
 of
 my
 of
 when
 I
 was
 like


coming
 up
 in
 my
 20s
 was
 like
 taking


these
 huge
 checks
 from
 whatever


forrunner
 or
 a
 general
 catalyst
 or


whatever.
 I
 never
 really
 thought
 about


the
 implications
 and
 then
 I
 think
 young


people
 have
 sort
 of
 learned
 what
 that


means
 at
 the
 end
 which
 means
 people
 are


going
 to
 want
 some
 return
 and
 often
 they


don't
 get
 it.
 So,
 I
 know
 you
 were


talking
 in
 your
 newsletter,
 I
 think
 it


was
 just
 this
 week,
 about
 another


article
 in
 New
 York
 Mag,
 which
 was
 about


the
 Hamptons
 and
 the
 sort
 of
 like


existential
 stress,
 I
 guess,
 that
 rich


people
 in
 the
 Hamptons
 feel
 about
 their


lifestyle
 and
 they
 feel
 competitive
 with


one
 another.
 And
 I
 think
 you
 said
 that


people
 were
 kind
 of
 like
 batting
 that


away
 and
 saying
 that's
 not
 so
 much
 of
 a


thing.
 But
 then
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 you


also
 wrote
 about
 weddings
 and
 how
 much


everyone
 is
 spending
 on
 weddings


nowadays,
 how
 expensive
 it
 is
 to
 be
 a


guest.
 I
 guess
 my
 question
 is
 like
 what


pockets
 of
 the
 culture,
 whether
 it's
 New


York
 or
 beyond,
 are
 are
 the
 most


consumerist
 or
 wealth
 obsessed
 for
 you


right
 now?
 Women.
 Um


the
 thing
 is
 it's
 all
 happening
 all
 the


the
 cameras
 are
 always
 on.
 So
 like
 let's


take
 weddings
 for
 example.
 Hamptons
 are


a
 different
 story.
 It's
 like
 a
 different


econom.
 There's
 so
 many
 different
 facets


going
 on
 there.
 With
 the
 weddings,
 it's


like
 it
 used
 to
 be
 about
 the
 bride
 and


now
 it's
 about
 every
 individual
 at
 the


wedding
 and
 the
 photo
 that
 they're


getting
 and
 where
 the
 photo
 is
 going
 to


end
 up
 after.
 I'm
 speaking
 from
 like
 the


point
 of
 view
 of
 a
 of
 a
 New
 York
 woman


who's
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 this
 is
 the


case
 for
 everyone,
 but
 something
 else


that
 I
 identified
 this
 morning
 with
 my


husband
 that
 I
 think
 is
 that
 I
 think


that
 the
 definition
 of
 friend
 who


qualifies
 for
 wedding
 is
 sort
 of
 like


expanding
 as
 well.
 So,
 there's
 this


weird
 gift
 culture
 going
 on
 where
 if
 I


invite
 you,
 then
 I
 have
 to
 invite
 you


and
 I'm
 expecting
 that
 you're
 going
 to


invite
 me
 to
 yours.
 And
 I
 also
 think


that
 there's
 something
 happening
 with


like
 DMs
 and
 group
 texts
 where
 people


are
 getting
 closer
 faster
 and
 like
 that


also
 affects
 the
 wedding
 guests
 lists.


Yeah,
 this
 resonates.
 Someone
 in
 one
 I


think
 someone
 in
 a
 a
 group
 chat
 recently


now
 they're
 getting
 married
 and
 I
 was


like
 what
 the
 heck?
 Why
 didn't
 I
 get
 an


invite?
 We're
 in
 a
 group
 chat
 together.


So
 I
 could
 see
 like
 that
 stress
 totally.


I
 was
 talking
 to
 somebody
 before
 my


wedding
 which
 was
 two
 months
 ago
 about


my
 wedding
 and
 they
 were
 like,
 "So
 am
 I


invited?"
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 "No,
 I'm
 just


telling
 you
 something
 about
 my
 life


right
 now."
 But
 there's
 also
 an


etiquette
 epidemic.
 Wait,
 what
 does
 that


mean?
 What
 does
 that
 mean?
 An
 etiquette


epidemic?
 Like
 people
 not
 holding
 the


door
 for
 you.
 People
 posting
 photos
 of


your
 wedding
 before
 you
 do,
 like
 things


like
 that.
 I
 think
 we're
 out
 of
 time.


That
 was
 so
 good.
 That
 was
 really
 I
 love


your
 newsletter.
 I
 love
 finally
 getting


a
 chance
 to
 chat.
 And
 I
 think
 we
 at
 some


point
 we
 should
 do
 another
 longer


episode
 just
 on
 like
 the
 group
 chat


economy.
 There
 were
 so
 many
 facets.


Thank
 you
 so
 much,
 Emily.
 Thank
 you.
