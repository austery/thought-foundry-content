(音樂)最近啊 臺灣國民黨新任主席鄭麗雯在接受德國之聲記者採訪的時候說出了一些比較驚人的言論啊在網上引起了激烈的爭論(音樂) 普丁不是獨裁者俄羅斯已經民主化很多年了這個全世界沒有一個完美的民主社會那回到我的問題是不是他才能決定說二戰爭是不是要發起你面對他這是一個當然不是這樣這是一個非常複雜的國際局勢當年北約答應了俄羅斯北約不東闊可是北約一而再再而三的跳票一而再再而三的東闊一直東闊到了俄羅斯的門口 This is the core reason for the war in Ukraine today If Zelensky had given up the Northern Treaty and not allowed Ukraine to join the Northern Treaty this problem would not have happened Zheng's remarks caused dissatisfaction from European governments and many people thought that it was a speech he made to please the CCP This also further strengthened the division of the Blue and Green Party supporters in Taiwan About a week later, the Prime Minister of Japan, Takasugi Kishida, said in a meeting If China takes aggressive actions against Taiwan It can be regarded as a threat to the survival of Japan It implies that Japan may take military action Then China's Vice President-General Xue Jian Posted a very shocking speech on social media After he quoted the speech of the Congress of Gao Shi and Zhao Miao He wrote "For that dirty head who broke in Should be beheaded without hesitation Are you ready?" Xue Jian's post Once again aroused the enthusiasm and nationalism of Chinese netizens Many Chinese netizens said That's good Then we can take over Japan and Taiwan at the same time 同一天,央媒发文宣布中国的第三艘航空母舰"福建舰"正式入列其中官媒说了一句非常耐人寻味的话福建舰必去的地方包括台湾海峡、南中国海和西太平洋那么这几件事的接连发生让台海局势和两岸话题再次升温所以今天我想来跟大家探讨这个话题 說起來啊,我確實很少在我的節目裡評論台灣的事但是關於兩岸問題、主權爭議、台灣是否屬於中國我是否支持台獨等等問題我確實一直以來都有自己的一些看法今天決定來跟大家聊一聊最後我也會用一個獨特的視角來給大家剖析我認為習近平會不會武統台灣如果會,他大概會在什麼時候發動這場戰爭我相信這是你在別的地方都沒有聽到過的 First, I don't want to discuss history with you Every time we talk about territorial disputes Whether it is Taiwan issue or South China Sea dispute, fishing island sovereignty etc Chinese always like to talk about history Then stand at a moral peak to criticize the disputed country They point out the historical point from a historical perspective Say that the Japanese ignore history From a moral point of view, say that Americans are old and sharp In the issue of territorial dispute, the Chinese official often used the phrase "Since ancient times, some land belongs to China" But I always think that using "since ancient times" to discuss territorial issues is very ridiculous Because since ancient times, there should be more ancient Who decides where this line of history should be drawn? Which era is the most reasonable node? If Americans want to talk about history, then I say that America was originally an Indian You give the United States back to the Indians If the Chinese want to talk about history, then I say that it is better to talk about the Great Wall of Korea The whole of Europe and Asia should belong to the Mongolians This is the British who are going to shut up Why don't the United Nations return to my Great Britain? 我想說什麼呢?如果我們誠實的去面對人類的歷史就會發現其實自古以來實力強大者得領土那是一個以征服和殖民為常態的時代一直到二戰以後那樣的時代才徹底終結 在二戰以前,近代中國長期脊弱,經常被欺負,也因此失去了很多領土包括俄國就佔領了很多中國的土地但等到中國近十幾二十年來開始強大起來的時候二戰後所形成的世界新秩序已經形成了 With the birth of globalization and international organizations, the logic of the weak and strong before World War II has already been lost. The strong country cannot easily launch wars like before and swallow the territory of the weak country. Because you will be sanctioned by the international community for economic or military sanctions. Iraq invading Kuwait is the most typical example. 這就意味著二戰以前被奪走的土地即使今天國力再度強盛也已經難以再通過武力收回換句話說世界的版圖在二戰後就已經被定格了這公平嗎也許不完全公平但這是維持世界和平的唯一方式不然就永遠還是沒完沒了的打下去 So after China was strong It was no longer possible to take down any island or land That era was over Since China was not able to fight So China had to pay tribute to history Try to find a historical node that is most beneficial to itself To prove that it has the so-called "正当" sovereignty What do I mean by this? It is meaningless to discuss the issue of territory from the historical and moral perspective It is impossible to reach a consensus between the two parties Because you will draw the line to a historical node that is beneficial to you It will also use another historical node that is beneficial to it to argue with you If China really wants to talk about history, from the late Qing Dynasty, Sha'er took away about 1.5 million square kilometers of land from China through a series of unequal treaties. If we count the independence of the foreign Mongolia, the total is about 3 million square kilometers, equivalent to 83 Taiwan. Why doesn't China want to come back? 再比如根據中共官方的說法早在三國時期吳國將軍衛溫和朱葛慈就已經航海到了宜州也就是今天的台灣所以中共認為是中國人最早發現並命名台灣因此台灣自古以來就是中國的 但是国际法是不认同这一点的因为主权的有效成立不在于最早发现而在于持续且有效的治理如果发现就等于属于我那么哥伦布发现了美洲难道整个美洲都应该属于意大利吗 這就是為什麼我不想討論歷史我也覺得現在用歷史去爭論台灣主權問題純粹浪費時間永遠不可能有結果就好像以色列和巴勒斯坦的歷史問題一樣這是雙方永遠都不可能獲得共識的 Since the story is not clear and we don't want to fight In my opinion, all the territorial disputes in modern times only have one correct solution which is to respect the public opinion The people on the land of Taiwan are they more willing to be the citizens of the People's Republic of China or the citizens of the Republic of China? In Taiwan, a public head is rarely in favor of the majority 这当然是合理的说到底国家和政府存在的意义是什么不就是为了服务人民保障他们的安全尊严与幸福吗政权不是目的只是手段如果人民根本都过得不幸福那么你争取来再多的领土又有什么意义呢 In fact, it is not a new case for a local people to choose which country they want to belong to There are many cases in history For example, Norway is out of Sweden, the Iceland is out of Denmark, Newfoundland joins Canada The Black Mountain is out of Sèvier, and there are also the Netherlands, the East Diaspora, South Sudan, Lithuania, Eishinia, Latvia, etc. These are all cases for the people to decide their future 當然啦,我們都知道中共肯定不會接受這個方案因為他們心裡非常清楚現在進行投票結果肯定是會有更多的台灣人不想加入中華人民共和國其實不敢搞公投就是心虛嘛你別看中共和小粉紅天天都是遙遙領先但對於人民是不是真的幸福人家想不想來心裡還是有點數的 但無論如何,現在擺在我們眼前的事實就是中共是不可能接受公投的而台灣也不具備宣布獨立的實力和國際支持那究竟應該怎麼辦呢?只要我們都能非常坦誠、非常現實的去想一想如果世界不想有一場台海戰爭那麼台灣問題唯一能夠圓滿解決的情況只有一種 That is, one day, most Taiwanese will willingly want to return to China If you think about it, there are only one way Because the Chinese Communist Party will never accept Taiwan's independence You can say that Taiwan will maintain its status, of course But the sword of Damocles will always be hanging on the heads of the Taiwanese and Asian people To be honest, in the era of Hu Wen, I once felt that Taiwan's problems may be solved in the next 10 to 20 years. Because China was developing rapidly at that time, people were full of hope for the future. From the perspective of freedom of speech and the open market economy, China was gradually opening up. Although it was slow, it was also a step by step connection with the civilized world. 當時有越來越多的台灣人到大陸工作和安家當年我在上海接觸到的台灣家庭全都非常喜歡上海有很多都已經在那裡生活多年落地生根並沒有回去台灣的打算當時我就在想 只要中國越來越好,越來越開放,越來越接受普世價值觀那麼也許有一天想要回歸的台灣人會比不想回歸的台灣人更多那台海問題其實就非常自然的解決了可惜在習近平上台之後這個願望終究還是破滅了 習近平開上了歷史倒車在經濟政治和社會管理等等方面都讓中國越來越封閉在習近平治下中國的言論和媒體自由徹底倒退與此同時他不斷通過媒體來煽動民族情緒讓中國人民逐漸失去了讓兩岸維持現狀的耐心 2019年習近平在《告臺灣同胞書》發表40周年紀念會上說出的那句祖國必須統一也必然統一等於宣誓了他在任期間必定要收復臺灣的決心但真正讓臺灣人民自願回歸的這個願望徹底失去希望的是兩件事香港國安法的實施以及2022年的動態清零 These two things made many people who were getting better at China see the essence of the CCP At least see the essence of Xi Jinping On Taiwan issue I always think Xi Jinping and those who are always laughing at the unification of the motherland 就像是男女關係當中一個性壓抑的男人如果我們把台灣比喻成一個美女中國大陸比喻成一個想要得到她的男人那麼你想要得到這個女人你當然也希望她是心甘情願的跟你在一起的對吧 If this girl still doesn't like you, then what you should do is make yourself better, better day by day. This girl will see one day that she is happier than being single with you. At that time, she will naturally give you a hug. But Xi Jinping and the little pinks are too aggressive Now this man is not only not getting better and better Also bullied another girl from the next door This man originally told a girl next door We are different in 50 years You can continue to live your life in your own way But I didn't expect that time is not over half The man can't stand it The king of the king said You have to live your life in my way 對自己的家裡人就更不用說了把他們當成人礦韭菜有一年家裡有人生病他就說不管有病沒病全都關到房間裡還用電焊把他們的房門焊死把他們的寵物活活打死最後還發生火災燒死了幾個被鎖在房間裡的人但這男的依舊不依不饒只要有家人不聽話就時時家暴對他們全打腳踢 這一切 台灣美女都看在眼裡現在更糟糕的是在這個男人自己一系列愚蠢的操作之下原本一直在變得越來越富有的他現在看起來經濟狀況也不行了連最後的吸引力都失去了 這下這個男人就更著急了他等不及了每天都蠢蠢欲動實在不行就準備硬上了美女確實看起來是無力反抗的但難得之所以還沒有行動是擔心美女身邊的朋友們也許會拔刀相助 不過男人這幾年來花了大錢天天健身現在全身健脂肉這不今年9月3號他剛脫了衣服向全世界展示他的肌肉確實非常強壯他希望可以以此嚇到美女讓美女乖乖就範同時也是在警告美女身邊的朋友們我可不怕你們 But that's the way it is in the world You keep hinting that I will be hard on you if you don't save the criminal The more you act tough and wild Then this girl will hate you more and more You guys are in love with each other The possibility of you and me being together is getting lower and lower It seems that it is not too late now 最終的結果就是男人硬上女人反抗朋友們可能相助也可能不相助但無論如何整個鄰居社區必定遭受到極大的破壞大家都受到嚴重的傷害最終所有人都是輸家 那麼現在似乎就只剩下一個問題了男人會不會真的硬上好了 不打比喻了接下來我們認真地來聊一聊短期內習近平會不會武統台灣如果會 那麼預計在什麼時候 先說結論,我認為習近平肯定是想在他卸任之前完成收復台灣的所謂的中華民族的偉大復興祖國統一絕對是最核心的目標,沒有之一中華民族偉大復興這個心願的危險之處就在於這不是一個類似十三五、十四五的什麼國家計劃能完成最好,不能完成也沒什麼大問題 中華民族的偉大復興是那種屬於一個政治狂人和野心家的必勝心願是他用來讓自己名流青史的手段如果習近平能夠收復台灣那麼他在新中國的歷史地位就能超過鄧小平可以跟毛澤東平起平坐了 歷史一次又一次的證明當這種目標被野心家上升為他們個人的歷史使命時他們是可以為此付出一切代價的有人可能要說了如果收復台灣是踩著大量台灣同胞的屍體得來的是通過大量人民解放軍的傷亡而來的那麼習近平只會遺臭萬年 Is it? It's too naive to think so. History is written by the victors. Especially in a world where the methods of speech control are so mature and brilliant. Chinese people who will not cross the wall for billions of years will not even know the truth of how many people died in the end. Why do they have to wait for thousands of years? Mao Zedong's world is the world of the first murderous demon in history He is also the most Chinese demon in history But his photos are still hanging on Tiananmen Square How many Chinese people see him as an idol Even today's Chinese young people have more and more hair pink Please don't underestimate the admiration for power in the Chinese's bones and the sense of recognition for the defeat of the king and the defeat of socialism. I dare to bet that as long as Xi Jinping takes over Taiwan, no matter how many Taiwanese and Chinese die in this, no matter how big a sinner he becomes in world history, he will always be the hero in the hearts of most Chinese. This is actually the most terrifying. 每次我说到我认为习近平大概率会武统台湾的时候身边的朋友们就会开始跟我分析习近平不可能打台湾的各种理由从经济上他们会说中共知道中国经济肯定扛不住西方的经济制裁经济是中共统治合法性的来源如果经济崩了 人民要造反放心 他不敢打造反放心他不敢搭 從軍事上他們會說跨海登陸是最難的軍事行動之一台海有130公里寬比諾曼底還寬一倍中共如果要強行登陸代價太大放心他不敢打他們甚至還會說很多中共高官的錢都是藏在美國的打了台灣這些錢就會全都被美國凍結放心中共肯定不敢打 是的 他們的分析邏輯都沒毛病 道理都正確但是這些分析卻全都犯了一個最根本的錯誤這也是大多數國際戰略專家 智庫 甚至是情報機構在評估威權政體的時候最容易犯的一個錯誤那就是 用正常人的思維去揣摩一個狂人的心態 If we can use the logic of normal people to push the ideas of the crazy How can there be those who have become the leaders of the country who kill people? Mao Zedong's later plans The Great Moon is near, the four seas are different Which one is logical and reasonable? Hitler in 1941 attacked the Soviet Union All the senators opposed They think that they attacked the Soviet Union before defeating the British It's a strategic suicide But Hitler still fought Before Japan attacked the Pearl Harbor in 1941 The Japanese navy is very clear Almost defeated in the US war The Navy Command has repeatedly advised the cabinet Do not attack the United States But the Japanese high-ranking officials still did it 甚至普京在2022年入侵烏克蘭時幾乎所有的經濟與軍事顧問都不贊成那麼再說回習近平他可是有前科的為了達成自己的政治目的甚至只是為了證明自己是對的就不惜一切代價的這種行為他已經幹過給我們看了 The movement is clear, it violates all the common sense and scientific principles The cost of paying is also extremely heavy The medical system is broken, the economy is heavily created, and the international image is damaged But it also persisted for three years Until the social ice and forest is out of control Even if the first two years can be considered reasonable The last year is almost a crazy behavior So I boldly say that almost all the experts and智库 who judge Xi Jinping as a person who dare not to dance are wrong. It's not that their analysis logic is wrong, but their assumption is wrong. Say it again, we can't use the death of a normal person to make a political crazy decision. 好了,既然我認為習近平大概率會對台灣發動軍事行動那麼他會在什麼時候行動呢?我們都知道如果台海戰爭真的打起來中國最大的威脅不是台灣,而是美國 我在兩周前的一期關於東亞人口危機的節目裡就有講到中國接下來要面對非常嚴重的人口老齡化問題中國的軍人儲備力量在對比人口依然在增長的美國時人數上的優勢會不斷減少 China's Shilin-Fubin people compared to the US From the peak of 1990, 700 Chinese to 100 Americans Now it has dropped from 400 to 100 By 2050, every 100 US military population China is less than 200 Only half of the Korean War period 與此同時,中國的經濟已經開始進入下星期房地產泡沫破裂、地方債務失控、外資撤離、製造業遷移年輕人畢業季失業、消費微微不振這所有的問題在未來十年內我都看不到有解決的可能也就是說,時間不站在中共這一邊戰略窗口正在關閉越往後就對中共越不利 And now there is a most important factor A sudden opportunity The name of this opportunity is Trump If I am Xi Jinping If I think that recovering Taiwan is a historical mission given by God Then there is no better opportunity than the next three years Even said that the next three years is my only window left in the future 未來三年是川普擔任美國總統的最後三年川普的理念是美國優先也就是只要管好美國的事其他的他不想多管川普現在走的是孤立主義路線他不在意得罪美國的傳統盟友他甚至多次表示他考慮退出北約因此作為歷史上最特立獨行的美國總統他大概率會是可預見未來所有的美國總統當中最有可能選擇不干涉台海戰爭的 Even if Trump wants to interfere at the beginning, but to be honest, the CCP can negotiate with him through exchange of interests. We can see from the way Trump deals with the "no war" First, he will try to avoid the US to get into the war. Second, he is using the mode of business to govern the country. The businessman is driven by interest, not values Compared to the former US president Trump and the leaders of the dictatorship are more compatible Many times he said he liked and admired Xi Jinping and Putin In recent polls Including the polls made by the right-wing media, Fox Trump's support rate is constantly dropping In the last US regional election The Republican Party was wiped out 也就是说三年后美国下任总统是来自民主党的概率是不低的美国选民也有这个历史如果不是在为总统寻求连任的情况下他们喜欢让政党轮替在共和党川普以前是民主党拜登拜登之前是川普的第一任之前是民主党奥巴马在之前是共和党小布什在之前是民主党克林顿在之前是共和党老布什就这样不停的交替轮换政党 所以,即便右派人士不愿意承认不管你对川普的看法是什么三年后的美国总统是来自民主党的概率是比较高的再不挤,起码也有50%这一点总没错吧那么 如果三年後真的選上來一個民主黨總統那麼美國就會走回全球化的道路跟北約再次統一戰線那麼北約聯合起來干涉台海戰爭的可能性肯定是會比川普在位期間大大增加的 Xi Jinping really want to take this risk? If he don't fight for 3 years, and wait for 4 years Then it's already 2032 China's economy and military power will decline further It's a matter of course Xi Jinping is almost 80 years old Will he want to wait until he is so old To start enjoying the high-light moment of his life? Can he have this patience? 我當然希望台海戰爭永遠不要發生但我感性的期望說服不了我理性的判斷這也許是我人生中第一次期望我自己的判斷是錯誤的 好 那我今天就講到這裡我是老周 橫美冷對 直言不諱我們下期再見
