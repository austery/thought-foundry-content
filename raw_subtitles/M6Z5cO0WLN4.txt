Hi
 everyone,
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangen
 from


the
 Norwegian
 So
 wealth
 fund
 and
 today
 I


put
 on
 a
 tie
 because
 I'm
 in
 really
 good


company
 with
 Cristina
 Gorava.
 Wonderful


to
 be
 with
 you.


>> Christina
 is
 the
 uh
 managing
 director
 of


IMF,
 the
 International
 Monetary
 Fund
 and


you
 are
 known
 for
 your
 visionary
 uh


leadership
 and
 the
 way
 you
 have
 been


advocating
 for
 really
 important
 bold


long-term
 reforms.
 So
 let's
 just
 start


with
 the
 beginning
 here.
 Uh
 IMF,
 what
 is


it?
 Well,
 the
 IMF
 was
 created
 um
 towards


the
 end
 of
 the
 Second
 World
 War
 together


with
 the
 World
 Bank
 to
 help
 countries


recover
 after
 the
 war
 and
 to
 put
 in


place
 institutions
 that
 can
 stabilize


the
 financial
 system.
 Our
 mandate


macroeconomic
 and
 financial
 stability


for
 growth
 and
 employment.
 uh
 we
 have
 a


uh
 membership
 of
 191
 countries.
 In
 fact,


over
 the
 last
 years,
 we
 got
 two
 new


members,
 small
 countries,
 Andor
 and


Likensstein.


>> That's
 good.
 And
 how
 do
 you
 help
 these


companies?


>> What
 we
 do
 for
 our
 members
 is
 first
 help


them
 to
 see
 the
 world
 economy
 from
 one


vantage
 point.
 Uh
 we
 have
 this
 unique


right
 to
 collect
 data
 from
 all
 countries


and
 we
 do
 that
 regularly.


So
 we
 can
 take
 the
 vital
 signs
 of


economies


aggregate
 the
 picture
 and
 then
 see
 what


are
 the
 trends
 in
 the
 world
 they
 should


be
 mindful
 of.
 M


>> secondly,
 when
 countries
 are
 in
 trouble


and
 they
 need
 quickly
 financing
 to


stabilize
 their
 economies,
 we
 come


through.
 We
 have
 lending
 capacity
 of
 $1


trillion.


We
 deploy
 it
 for
 countries
 in
 crisis.


Uh
 some
 are
 middle-income
 countries,


some
 are
 poor,
 vulnerable
 countries.
 And


the
 third
 thing
 we
 do
 is
 we
 help


countries
 build
 good
 institutions


especially
 monetary
 authorities,


fiscal
 authorities,


data,
 statistical
 capacity
 so
 they
 can


see
 their
 own
 economic
 development
 uh


with
 more
 uh
 educated
 eye.


>> How
 bad
 does
 the
 crisis
 need
 to
 be


before
 they
 call
 you?


>> Well,
 sometimes
 they
 call
 before
 a


crisis
 hits.
 We
 have
 also
 a
 function
 to


prevent
 crisis
 from
 happening.
 Uh


sometimes
 they
 call
 when
 markets
 close


on
 them.
 Um
 I'll
 tell
 you
 a
 story
 of
 my


own
 country.
 I
 am
 Bulgarian.


>> In
 the
 late
 90s,
 Bulgaria
 was
 hit
 by


hyperinflation,


over
 8,000%


inflation,
 and
 it
 caught
 on
 the
 IMF.
 So


what
 the
 IMF
 did
 for
 my
 country
 was
 to


help
 us
 put
 in
 place
 a
 currency
 board


which
 really
 stabilized
 the
 uh
 economy


and
 put
 fiscal
 discipline.
 Bulgaria


today
 has
 24%
 debt
 to
 GDP,


>> 3%
 deficit
 and
 as
 of
 January
 1
 would
 be


a
 member
 of
 the
 Euro
 zone.


>> Um
 to
 among
 the
 biggest
 clients
 of
 the


fund,
 Argentina
 has
 had
 a
 number
 of


programs.
 So
 far,
 none
 of
 them
 got
 the


country
 completely
 out
 of
 trouble.
 M


>> we
 are
 hopeful
 that
 our
 current
 program


uh
 supporting
 a
 president
 that
 is
 very


reform-minded,
 very
 determined
 can
 bring


Argentina
 to
 a
 point
 of
 not
 needing
 uh


to
 to
 borrow
 from
 the
 IMF
 anymore.


>> Was
 it
 when
 IMF
 bailed
 out
 uh
 Bulgaria


that
 you
 decided,
 you
 know what,
 I
 would


love
 to
 be
 in
 charge
 of
 that
 one
 day?


>> You
 know,
 at
 that
 time
 when
 the
 IMF


bailed
 Bulgaria,
 I
 was
 actually
 at
 the


World
 Bank.
 I
 was
 already
 in
 one
 of
 the


two
 Bretonwoods
 institutions.
 Uh
 never


crossed
 my
 mind
 at
 that
 time
 that
 we


would
 be
 sitting
 with
 you
 and
 I
 would


have
 been
 already
 six
 years
 at
 the
 helm


of
 the
 IMF.


>> The
 the
 World
 Bank
 was
 founded
 at
 the


same
 time
 as
 IMF.
 So
 how
 do
 you
 uh
 split


the
 work
 between
 you?
 So
 what
 the
 World


Bank
 does
 is
 to
 look
 at


sectors
 in
 the
 economy
 and
 fund


investment
 projects
 predominantly


education,


roads,


access
 to
 electricity.


Right
 now
 the
 bank
 is
 concentrated
 on


creating
 conditions
 for
 more
 jobs
 in
 the


developing
 world.
 M


>> in
 contrast
 the
 IMF
 and
 and
 the
 and
 the


World
 Bank
 is
 primarily
 about
 the


emerging
 markets
 in
 developing


economies.
 This
 is
 where
 their
 work


primarily
 uh
 goes.
 The
 IMF
 in
 contrast


is
 about
 macroeconomic
 and
 financial


stability.
 We
 don't
 fund
 investment


projects.
 What
 we
 fund
 is
 balance
 of


payment
 needs.
 So
 a
 country


is
 about
 to
 crush,
 we
 come
 and
 we
 say


here
 is
 a
 cushion
 for
 you.


>> Get
 your
 economy
 in
 order.
 The
 best


value
 from
 the
 fund
 is
 to
 put
 in
 place


good
 policies
 and
 responsible


institutions.
 So
 the
 country
 on
 its
 own


can
 have
 a
 good
 uh
 trajectory
 of
 growth.


Uh
 the
 IMF
 works
 with
 all
 countries.
 All


191
 countries
 go
 through
 what
 we
 call


article
 4
 consultation.
 It
 is
 a


technical
 term
 of
 taking
 the
 vital
 sides


of
 uh
 each
 economy.
 Big,
 small,
 rich,


poor,
 they
 all
 need
 to
 disclose
 to
 the


fund.


>> But
 both
 but


>> where
 the
 economies
 are.


>> Absolutely.
 AJ
 Banga,
 he's
 from
 India.


He
 runs
 the
 World
 Bank.
 You're
 from


Bulgaria.
 You
 run
 the


>> the
 IMF.
 uh
 should
 we
 read
 anything
 into


the
 fact
 that
 both
 these
 important


institutions
 are
 run
 by
 people
 from
 uh


emerging
 and
 developing
 markets?
 I
 think


it
 is
 a
 very
 positive
 development


because


>> who
 does
 the
 world
 bank
 serve?


>> The
 emerging
 markets,
 the
 developing


economies.
 Um
 who
 is
 the
 biggest
 uh


demander
 of
 resources
 from
 the
 fund


emerging
 markets
 and
 developing


economies.
 And
 I
 actually
 think
 that
 the


fact
 that
 both
 AJ
 and
 I
 understand


how
 tough
 it
 could
 be


>> help
 us
 to
 navigate
 the
 institutions


better.
 But
 above
 all,
 it
 brings
 this


empathy
 for
 the
 impact
 reforms
 have
 on


people.
 And
 my
 message
 to
 my
 staff
 is


policies
 are
 for
 people.
 They're
 not
 for


the
 books.
 They're
 not
 for
 the


parliaments.
 They
 are
 to
 improve
 lives


of
 people.
 And
 that
 is
 to
 my
 mind
 the


best
 I
 bring
 uh
 to
 the
 fund.


>> Who
 owns
 IMF?


>> The
 191
 members
 of
 the
 IMF.
 Very


interesting.
 How
 are
 we
 funded?


We
 are
 like
 a
 savings
 bank.
 Countries


commit
 resources
 to
 the
 fund.
 Then
 we


lend
 this
 money.
 We
 are
 paid
 back
 with


interest
 and
 we
 pay
 back
 those
 who
 fund


us.
 In
 other
 words,
 we
 do
 not
 ask


taxpayers
 for
 contributions.
 We
 ask


countries
 to
 trust
 us
 with
 the


management
 of
 their
 resources
 and
 uh
 the


beauty
 of
 it
 is
 that
 u
 we
 can
 do
 a
 lot


very
 quickly
 because
 we
 don't
 have
 to
 go


knock
 on
 doors
 and
 say
 please
 can
 you
 we


need
 more
 money
 can
 you
 please
 fund
 us


>> we
 are
 today
 in
 Washington
 DC
 right


because
 this
 is
 where
 you
 are


headquartered
 so
 how
 US-
 ccentric


>> is
 the
 fund


>> well
 the
 uh
 US
 is
 our
 largest
 um
 member


they
 hold
 over
 17%


>> of
 the
 quarters
 of
 the
 IMF
 and
 in
 that


sense
 they
 are
 the
 only
 member
 that
 has


v2
 power.
 Uh
 we
 have
 the
 most
 important


decisions
 we
 take
 require
 over
 85%
 at


least
 85%


voting.
 So
 if
 the
 US
 is
 not
 on
 board
 on


important
 decisions
 uh
 then
 uh
 they


cannot
 uh
 happen
 and
 in
 that
 sense
 we


engage
 a
 lot
 with
 us
 of
 course
 but
 we


are
 an
 institution
 of
 191
 members
 and


for
 for
 us
 for
 the
 staff
 of
 the
 the
 fund


what
 matters
 is
 are
 we
 making
 a


meaningful
 contribution
 to
 a
 better


working
 of
 the
 world
 economy.


through
 our
 analysis
 and
 by
 cushioning


countries
 when
 they
 are
 in
 trouble.


>> Let's
 touch
 on
 the
 the
 world
 economy


because
 Christina
 probably
 nobody
 in
 the


world
 has
 got
 better
 statistics
 than
 you


about
 the
 state
 of
 the
 world.
 So
 how
 do


you
 read
 the
 state
 of
 the
 world
 just


now?


>> Better
 than
 we
 feared
 worse
 than
 it


needs
 to
 be.
 Um,
 we
 have
 a
 world
 economy


that
 has
 proven
 to
 be
 remarkably


resilient
 to
 the
 multiple
 shocks
 that


have
 been
 hitting
 us
 starting
 with


COVID.


>> We
 are
 projecting
 over
 3%
 growth
 this


year
 and
 next.


despite
 the
 transformational
 forces
 that


are
 hitting
 us
 um
 geopolitics,


technology,
 demography,
 climate,
 we
 have


a
 world
 that
 continues
 to
 grow.


But
 first,


this
 growth
 is
 too
 slow
 to
 meet
 the


aspirations
 of
 people
 around
 the
 world


for
 better
 lives.
 M


>> when
 we
 look
 back
 before
 COVID
 the


average
 growth
 rate
 was
 3.7%.


Now
 it
 lingers
 around
 three.
 Second
 we


have
 a
 world
 economy
 that
 has
 not
 been


really
 fully
 tested
 for
 its
 resilience.


And
 what
 I
 mean
 is
 that
 uh
 we
 don't


quite
 know
 how
 this
 multiple
 forces
 of


transformation


may
 test
 it
 in
 the
 future.


>> But
 it's
 being
 tested
 now,
 right?


>> Totally.
 It's
 being
 tested.


>> And
 why
 is
 it
 so
 why
 is
 it
 more


resilient
 than
 we
 thought?


>> Three
 reasons


actually.
 Great
 question.
 I
 thought
 a


lot
 about
 it.
 My
 colleagues
 and
 I
 have


debated
 this.
 First
 reason


over
 the
 last
 decades
 because
 of
 the


crisis
 that
 hit
 in
 the
 past
 especially


the
 u
 uh
 global
 financial
 uh
 crisis


countries
 have
 built
 stronger


institutions
 and
 they
 have
 put
 in
 place


sound
 policies
 and
 that
 applies
 to
 many


countries
 in
 the
 emerging
 uh
 world
 but


also
 uh
 in
 advanced
 economies.
 We
 have


independent


central
 banks.
 We
 have
 in
 many
 countries


fiscal
 rules.
 You
 cannot
 spend
 money
 you


don't
 have.
 Uh
 we
 have
 tax
 systems
 that


are
 more
 or
 less
 delivering
 the
 public


uh
 resource
 necessary.
 Reason
 number


one.
 Reason
 number
 two,


over
 the
 last
 decades,
 we
 also
 have
 seen


in
 many
 many
 countries
 the
 state
 moving


out
 of
 running
 the
 economy
 and
 letting


private
 sector
 do
 the
 job.


At
 a
 time
 of
 rapid
 changes,
 private


sector
 is
 more
 agile.
 It
 is
 more


resilient.
 What
 what
 uh
 we
 saw
 when
 um


um
 President
 Trump
 announced
 tariffs,


what
 did
 the
 private
 sector
 do?
 They


rushed,
 they
 bought
 goods
 before
 the


tariffs
 hit
 so
 they
 can
 cushion
 their
 uh


businesses
 against
 that
 particular


shock.
 And
 the
 third
 reason
 is
 um
 in


fact
 the
 latest
 shock,
 the
 trade
 shock


has
 proven
 to
 be
 smaller
 than
 we
 feared


it
 may
 be.
 So
 on
 April
 2nd
 the
 total


announced
 tariffs
 were
 around
 23%.


When
 we
 look
 at
 the
 level
 now


17
 18%.


>> And
 when
 we
 look
 at
 what
 is
 being


collected
 as
 tariffs
 more
 like
 8
 9%.


>> Most
 importantly


what
 did
 we
 worry
 about?
 We
 worried
 that


all
 countries
 would
 say
 me
 too.
 So
 you


us
 puts
 tariffs
 I'm
 going
 to
 put
 tariffs


to
 the
 US
 to
 others
 and
 that
 tit
 for
 tat


did
 not
 happen.
 I
 know
 there
 are
 people


who
 are
 saying
 oh
 we
 should
 have
 gone


aggressively
 and
 hit
 back.
 Truth
 is
 if


we
 were
 to
 have
 that
 tit
 for
 tat
 hitting


back
 uh
 we
 would
 have
 seen
 much
 uh
 more


dramatic
 negative
 impact
 uh
 on
 global


growth.
 M
 one
 of
 the
 things
 you
 are


quite
 vocal
 about
 is
 the
 debt
 levels
 and


you
 say
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 for
 instance


the
 US
 should
 deal
 with
 the
 with
 the


deficit
 sooner
 rather
 than
 later.
 Why


why
 uh
 are
 you
 so
 concerned
 about
 the


high
 debt
 level?


>> Because
 uh
 servicing
 debt
 especially


when
 interest
 rates
 are
 no
 more
 zero
 or


even
 negative
 takes
 away
 money
 from


other
 productive
 purposes.
 What
 is
 being


spent
 to
 service
 that
 is
 not
 spent
 for


infrastructure,
 for
 getting
 ready
 for


AI,
 for
 educating
 people
 for
 a
 much


faster
 changing
 world
 and
 because
 when


you
 have
 very
 high
 level
 of
 debt,
 you


really
 have
 no
 buffers.


>> So
 when
 the
 next
 shock
 comes,
 what
 do


you
 do?


>> Yeah.
 In
 the
 uh
 uh
 time
 of
 COVID,


I
 was
 out
 there
 telling
 governments
 and


businesses
 spend,
 protect
 your
 people,


protect
 your
 uh
 businesses,
 keep
 the


receipts,
 but
 spend


at
 that
 time
 there
 was
 fiscal
 space,


there
 was
 monetary
 policy
 space
 that
 was


possible.
 Today
 not
 possible.
 Actually


one
 big
 problem
 we
 we
 face
 and
 when
 I


talk
 about
 the
 world
 is
 doing
 well
 but


not
 perfectly
 um
 is
 that
 when
 countries


put
 in
 place
 various
 programs
 to
 support


people
 and
 businesses


and
 they
 don't
 need
 them
 anymore
 it's


very
 difficult
 to
 take
 them
 back.
 So
 we


are
 saying
 fiscal
 consolidation
 do
 it


slowly
 do
 it
 gradually


but
 get
 your
 house
 in
 good
 order
 for
 the


next
 shock
 to
 come.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 it


would
 be.
 I
 just
 know


there
 would
 be
 something
 for
 which
 we


need
 to
 have
 the
 capacity
 uh
 to
 cope.


>> When
 you
 write
 your
 speech
 and
 you
 tell


the
 United
 States
 to
 get
 the
 house
 in


order,
 do
 you
 think
 that
 perhaps
 I


should
 be
 a
 bit
 careful?
 They
 own
 17%
 of


the
 bank
 and
 uh


>> well
 fortunately
 um
 the
 Treasury


Secretary
 Scott
 Bessent,
 he's
 on
 the


same
 page.
 He
 thinks
 that
 they
 need
 to


bring
 down
 the
 deficit
 to
 3%.
 Uh
 and
 uh


you
 know
 I


we
 are
 paid
 to
 speak
 truth
 to
 power.


>> Absolutely.
 Do
 you
 think
 inflation
 is


under
 control
 now?


>> It
 it
 has
 gone
 down.
 Yes.
 We
 see
 the
 uh


trend
 in
 disinflation
 continuing
 in
 the


right
 direction.
 Uh
 of
 course
 tariffs


are
 putting
 pressure
 on
 prices
 in
 the


United
 States.
 So
 far
 that
 was
 mute.


One
 because
 there
 was
 prepositioning
 of


goods.
 Two
 because
 companies
 profitable


they
 could
 eat
 up
 some
 of
 the
 tariffs.


We
 don't
 know
 how
 this
 would
 continue
 in


the
 next
 months
 in
 the
 next
 year.
 Uh
 and


for
 this
 reason
 we
 are
 not
 quite
 yet


ready
 to
 say
 victory.
 Inflation
 is
 uh
 uh


gone
 everywhere.


>> Is
 climate


>> in
 Europe?
 It's
 okay.
 Europe
 has
 done
 a


very
 good
 job
 in
 bringing
 inflation
 to


target.


>> Is
 climate
 risk
 a
 financial
 risk?


>> Of
 course
 it
 is.
 Of
 course
 it
 is
 in
 two


ways.
 First,


if
 you
 accumulate
 in
 your
 portfolio


assets


that
 are
 vulnerable
 either
 to
 cl
 climate


shocks
 or
 to
 change
 in
 policy,


then
 you
 can
 see
 um
 unexpected


significant
 losses
 on
 your
 on
 your


assets.
 Um
 and
 the
 second
 is
 because
 we


see
 already
 that
 some
 countries
 and
 some


communities
 are
 more
 vulnerable.
 Uh
 if


you
 live
 in
 the
 Philippines
 or
 Vietnam


these
 days
 very
 likely
 you
 would
 be
 hit


dramatically.
 That
 hit
 on
 the
 economy


and
 on
 communities
 on
 people
 it


translates
 into
 financial
 uh
 risk.
 We


have
 done
 quite
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 at
 the


fund
 to
 think
 through
 financial


stability
 risks
 that
 are
 related
 to


either


the
 economy
 changing
 rapidly


uh
 which
 by
 the
 way
 seems
 to
 be
 now
 a


slower
 process
 to
 decarbonization


>> or
 because
 of
 the
 uh
 uh
 high
 uh


propensity
 of
 climate
 shocks
 that
 affect


um
 uh
 businesses
 and
 households
 and


affect
 the
 financial
 system.


>> Continuing
 on
 with
 with
 the
 changes


we're
 seeing,
 um
 AI
 um
 now
 you
 can
 look


you
 can
 look
 at
 that
 through
 many


different
 lenses,
 but
 if
 we
 look
 at
 it


through
 the
 IMF
 lens,
 what
 how
 is
 it


impacting
 the
 world?


>> Well,
 from
 an
 a
 uh
 IMF
 lens,
 we
 look
 at


three
 things.
 First,
 we
 look
 at
 our


countries
 ready


>> Yeah.


>> for
 AI.
 uh
 we
 created
 an
 index
 on
 AI


preparedness
 that
 ranks
 174
 countries
 on


four
 things.
 One,
 digital


infrastructure.
 Can
 you
 quickly
 tap
 into


AI?
 Two,
 labor
 market
 flexibility


skills.


Is
 the
 economy


flexible
 enough
 to
 adapt
 quickly?
 Three,


is
 innovation


flowing?


So
 you
 have
 AI
 um
 algorithms
 do
 they
 go


into
 health
 care
 into
 transportation


into
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 economy
 and
 for
 the


fourth
 prove
 to
 be
 the
 most
 difficult


regulation
 and
 ethics.


>> So
 when
 we
 rank
 countries
 what
 do
 we
 see


advanced
 economies
 do
 much
 better


actually
 on
 the
 top
 of
 this
 list
 are


three
 countries
 um
 Singapore,
 Denmark,


United
 States.
 They
 kind
 of
 you
 can
 put


them
 in
 in
 uh
 different
 one
 two
 three


but
 this
 is
 the
 top
 of
 the
 list.
 You


look
 at
 the
 bottom
 developing
 economies


uh
 they
 in
 their
 vast
 majority
 they're


not
 they're
 not
 ready.


>> What
 does
 it
 mean
 they're
 not
 ready?
 It


means
 that
 uh
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 be


able
 to
 uh
 capture
 the
 productivity


enhancement
 that
 comes
 with
 AI.
 And
 this


is
 the
 second
 thing
 we
 look
 at.
 How
 is


AI
 affecting


uh
 potentially
 growth,
 productivity
 and


growth?


You
 know
 that
 the
 views
 are
 very
 diverse


from
 the


ultra
 optimist
 to
 the
 ultra
 pessimist.


We
 are
 somewhere
 in
 the
 middle.
 We
 we


think
 that
 AI
 can
 lift
 up
 productivity


and
 growth


substantially
 somewhere
 between
 0.1
 and


0.8%
 8%
 of
 additional
 growth.
 Remember


growth
 is
 slow.
 Growth
 is
 slow.
 That
 is


high.
 Uh
 if
 AI
 helps
 help
 us,
 that
 would


be
 of
 tremendous
 uh
 benefit
 to
 humanity.


But
 then
 we
 are
 looking
 also
 at


how
 is
 this
 impact
 going
 to
 come
 through


the
 labor
 market.
 And
 there
 it
 is
 a
 very


to
 my
 mind
 troubling
 story
 because
 what


we
 assess
 is
 that
 over
 the
 next
 couple


of
 years
 in
 rich
 countries
 60%
 of
 jobs


will
 be
 impacted
 by
 AI
 either
 enhanced


becoming
 more
 productive
 changed
 or


eliminated
 in
 uh
 globally
 on
 average


about
 40%
 in
 lowincome
 countries
 26%.
 %.


You
 take
 any
 one
 of
 these
 percentages,


this
 is
 like
 a
 tsunami
 hitting
 the
 labor


market


>> and
 are
 we
 ready
 for
 that?
 And


>> but
 as
 an
 idealist
 uh
 because
 you
 are
 in


a
 way
 an
 idealist
 I
 guess
 uh


>> and
 this
 will
 make
 the
 world
 more


inequal.


So
 what
 do
 you


>> So
 that
 is
 the
 problem
 that
 that
 we
 see


what
 what
 we
 what
 we
 worry
 about
 is
 that


both
 within
 countries
 and
 across


countries
 we
 may
 see
 divergence


>> because
 of
 AI.
 What
 can
 we
 do?
 The
 only


thing
 we
 can
 do
 is
 to
 help
 countries


prepare
 to
 move
 faster,
 take
 advantage


of
 AI
 and
 also
 think
 about
 the


distributional
 impact
 of
 AI
 because
 it


is
 not
 given
 that
 AI
 should
 be
 dividing


societies.
 Maybe
 AI
 can
 solve
 problems


in
 societies


>> but
 only
 if
 we
 are
 ready.
 And
 and
 I


should
 say
 that
 I
 do
 believe
 in
 the
 best


uh
 of
 uh
 in
 people


Uh
 I
 was
 um
 for
 5
 years
 a
 humanitarian


commissioner
 for
 the
 European
 Union.
 I


went
 to
 the
 most
 tragic
 locations
 on


this
 planet
 from
 the
 Kiti
 earthquake
 to


the
 Syria
 war
 to
 the
 triple
 disaster
 in


Japan.
 Every
 place
 I
 would
 go
 what
 would


impress
 me
 the
 most
 is
 how
 people
 help


other
 people.
 Majority
 of
 human
 race
 are


really
 good
 compassionate
 people
 and


there
 is
 a
 minority
 that
 is
 very
 angry


and
 very
 loud
 and
 I
 think
 that
 we
 need


to
 find
 that
 tune
 to
 listen
 to
 these


voices
 of
 goodness
 because
 most
 people


are
 genuinely
 good
 people.


>> Yeah,


>> that's
 why
 I
 am
 idealist.
 I
 believe
 in


the
 goodness.
 So
 I
 agree
 humanity


>> I
 agree
 with
 that
 but
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 surprised
 me
 a
 bit
 is
 that
 not
 more


countries
 are
 making
 a
 a
 concerted


effort
 in
 lifting
 the
 whole
 AI
 level
 in


the
 countries.
 Now
 Iceland
 has
 just


launched
 such
 a
 project.
 There
 is


something
 going
 on
 in
 Sweden
 which
 is


you
 know
 a
 bit
 similar.


>> But
 shouldn't
 more
 countries
 really
 put


a
 lot
 of
 money
 and
 effort
 into
 this?
 I


think
 that
 um
 uh
 countries
 that
 have
 the


um
 comparative
 advantage,
 cheap
 energy,


preferably
 renewable
 energy,


>> um
 high
 level
 of
 investment
 in
 research


and
 development,
 they
 have


responsibility
 to
 move
 the
 frontier
 and


then
 of
 course
 u
 share
 what
 they
 get


with
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world.
 And
 this
 is


where
 it
 would
 be
 interesting
 to
 see


what
 happens
 with
 cooperation
 on
 our


planet.
 So
 here
 is
 an
 observation
 that


may
 may
 surprise
 you.


Since
 we
 got
 into
 a
 more
 geopolitically


confrontational
 world,
 I
 see
 in
 my
 work


at
 the
 IMF
 more
 appetite
 to
 cooperate.


>> Why?
 Because
 now
 people
 realize
 they


cannot
 take
 that
 for
 granted.
 We
 used
 to


take
 it
 for
 granted.
 Of
 course,
 we


cooperate


because
 we
 cannot
 take
 it
 anymore
 for


granted
 at
 least
 in
 the
 discussions
 uh


uh
 at
 the
 IMF.
 I
 see
 more
 maturity,
 more


willingness
 to
 listen
 to
 each
 other.
 uh


would
 it
 last
 would
 it
 translate
 into


strong
 cooperation
 globally
 is
 to
 be


seen
 but
 it's
 there


>> well
 I
 I
 suspect
 IMF
 is
 one
 of
 the
 few


places
 where
 we
 see
 it
 then
 because


it's
 not
 very
 common


>> I
 actually
 you
 know
 it's
 very


interesting
 you're
 saying
 that
 one
 of


our
 members
 made
 an
 interesting
 comment


saying
 well
 the
 IMF
 is
 like
 a
 a
 island


of
 cooperation


uh
 and
 it
 is
 true
 so
 Why
 is
 that
 so?
 I


have
 a
 theory
 on
 that.
 One,
 because
 we


actually
 uh
 make
 a
 huge
 effort,
 my


colleagues,
 myself,
 our
 board
 of


directors
 to
 keep
 the
 world
 together.


Actually,
 I
 I
 I
 had
 a
 simple
 message
 to


the
 membership.
 They
 come
 for
 annual


meetings.
 They
 come
 for
 spring
 meetings.


My
 message
 is
 you
 leave
 your
 trade
 war,


your
 cold
 war,
 your
 hot
 war
 outside
 of


this
 room.
 You
 come
 here.
 Let's
 talk


about
 the
 health
 of
 the
 world
 economy


and
 what
 we
 can
 do
 to
 strengthen
 that


health.
 So
 far
 that
 works.


>> Yeah.
 Are
 we
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 an
 AI


bubble?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 we
 are
 worried
 a
 little


bit
 that
 the
 um
 massive
 investments
 in


AI


uh
 are
 hitting
 this
 segment
 of
 markets.


But
 we
 have
 to
 recognize
 that
 companies


are
 profitable.
 they
 are
 making
 money
 on


AI.
 In
 other
 words,
 this
 increase
 in


investment
 is
 justified
 by
 uh


profitability.


>> Uh
 will
 there
 be
 a
 correction?


Most
 likely
 uh
 some
 yes,
 just
 because


enthusiasm
 has
 pushed
 valuations
 that


are
 now
 so
 stretched.
 Would
 that
 take
 us


to
 a
 very
 bad
 place?
 I
 doubt
 it
 again


because
 you
 see
 how
 AI
 is
 translating


into
 marketable
 products
 that
 have


consumers
 and
 are
 being
 sold
 for
 profit.


Sold
 for
 profit.


>> So
 you
 you're
 in
 the
 camp
 which
 you


think
 is
 a
 positive
 bubble.
 I


>> because
 it
 changes.


>> I
 think
 I
 I
 think
 I
 think
 it
 is
 an


incredible


rapidly


changing
 force
 of
 transformation.


Incredible.


>> Do
 you
 manage
 to
 use
 it
 in
 the
 fund?


>> Oh,
 of
 course
 we
 have
 um
 u
 multiple
 fund


specific
 AI
 products.
 We
 have
 uh
 IDA


that
 helps
 us
 do
 our
 our
 work.
 For
 our


annual
 meetings,
 we
 have
 Sammy.
 Sammy


guides
 our
 visitors.
 Um
 we
 of
 course
 use


copilot.
 I
 don't
 know
 whether
 you
 use
 it


but
 you
 know
 I
 I
 find
 it
 super
 helpful.


And
 uh
 we
 are
 asking
 um
 our
 community
 of


professionals


to
 measure
 us
 vis
 similar
 organizations.


So
 far
 so
 good.
 the
 IMF
 is
 up
 there
 in
 a


in
 a
 strong
 position
 of
 how
 we
 uh


quickly
 adapt
 to
 a
 world
 of
 AI.


>> Have
 you
 got
 a
 view
 on
 the
 energy


transition?


>> Well,
 I
 I
 do.
 I
 think
 the
 um
 um
 if
 there


is
 one
 issue
 that
 AI
 creates,
 it's
 not


so
 much
 the
 stretch
 valuations,
 it
 is
 a


departure
 from
 a
 path
 towards


decarbonization.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 would
 that
 be
 a
 um
 massive


uh
 shift?
 Uh
 let's
 see.
 I
 hope
 no.
 Uh


one
 thing
 that
 is
 very
 clear
 is
 that
 um


uh
 climate
 uh
 change
 is
 happening.


It
 is
 real.
 Uh
 we
 need
 to
 do
 two
 things.


Try
 to
 reduce
 the
 impact
 as
 much
 as
 we


can
 and
 adapt
 to
 it.
 M
 uh
 and
 I
 think


the
 um
 uh
 for
 for
 us
 at
 the
 IMF
 there
 is


one
 aspect
 of
 of
 this
 conversation
 which


is
 and
 you
 brought
 it
 in
 your
 questions


uh
 when
 is
 climate
 a
 factor
 in


macroeconomic
 and
 financial
 uh
 stability


and
 when
 it
 is
 we
 have
 to
 take
 it
 into


account.
 We
 cannot
 do
 our
 job
 well
 with


a
 country
 like
 uh
 Jamaica
 if
 we
 are
 not


integrating
 in
 their
 budget
 plans
 and
 in


their
 um
 economic
 uh
 objectives
 the


risks
 of
 climate
 uh
 shocks
 and
 actually


Jamaica
 is
 a
 good
 example
 where
 the
 fund


engaged


on
 the
 policy
 side
 to
 help
 the
 country


be
 more
 resilient
 to
 climate
 shocks
 now


and
 in
 the
 future.
 Now
 the
 US
 is
 saying


that
 IMF
 has
 drifted
 from
 its
 core


mission
 of
 stability.


>> How
 do
 you
 resp
 how
 do
 you
 respond
 to


that
 statement?
 We
 we
 one
 it
 is
 true


that
 we
 can
 we
 have
 to
 be
 always
 mindful


where
 we
 put
 our
 resources


>> and
 I
 am
 very
 respectful
 when
 any
 of
 our


members
 of
 course
 uh
 US
 included
 tell
 us


be
 careful
 you
 may
 be
 venturing
 into
 too


many
 uh
 directions
 we
 are
 a
 small


institution
 we
 are
 about
 4,000
 people
 we


are
 a
 fairly
 high
 performing
 institution


so
 everybody
 wants
 us
 to
 do
 more.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> And
 different
 things
 for
 them.
 So
 we


have
 to
 have
 the
 discipline
 to
 stay
 uh


focused
 and
 I
 would
 say
 uh
 when
 I
 look


at
 the
 um
 delivery
 from
 the
 fund
 what
 we


are
 doing
 for
 the
 world
 that
 yeah
 we
 are


doing
 pretty
 well.


>> Do
 you
 personally
 have
 to
 compromise
 uh


when
 it
 comes
 to
 things
 that
 you
 believe


in
 in
 order
 to
 keep
 keep
 the
 peace?


>> We
 are
 a
 membership
 organization.
 I'm


here
 to
 help
 the
 members
 work
 together,


collaborate
 in
 a
 world
 which
 is
 more


complex
 these
 days.
 So,
 uh
 what
 I


believe
 of
 course
 matters,
 but
 what


matters
 even
 more
 is
 what
 my
 membership


needs
 from
 us


>> and
 that
 is
 my
 guiding
 star.


>> Is
 this
 a
 more
 stressful
 environment


than
 CO?


I
 think
 co
 was
 pretty
 stressful.
 Uh


imagine
 you
 are
 you
 are
 responsible
 for


the
 health
 of
 the
 world
 economy
 and
 it


comes
 to
 a
 screeching
 stop.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 I
 think
 what
 is
 uh
 what
 is
 um


different
 today
 is
 that
 getting
 uh


cooperation


uh
 takes
 more
 more
 effort.
 M


>> uh
 when
 we
 had
 co
 I
 remember
 vividly


we
 called
 emergency
 meetings
 of
 our


members
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 to
 do
 uh
 and


we
 came
 up
 with
 very
 strong
 response.


I'm
 very
 proud
 of
 what
 the
 fund
 has


done.
 Mhm.


>> We
 deployed
 about
 a
 trillion
 dollars
 in


lending
 and
 through
 the
 allocation
 of


special
 drawing
 right
 650
 billion


injection
 in
 reserves
 that
 helped
 to
 put


a
 a
 a
 floor
 under
 the
 the
 feet
 of
 many


many
 many
 countries
 and
 we
 did
 it
 very


quickly.
 Um
 when
 COVID
 was
 announced
 by


uh
 the
 World
 Health
 Organization,
 in
 one


week
 we
 dispersed
 our
 first
 emergency


loan
 to
 uh
 the
 Kygis
 Republic.
 But
 most


importantly,
 we
 helped
 countries
 to
 see


what
 is
 the
 policy
 path
 and
 at
 that


point
 what
 was
 the
 policy
 path.
 Monetary


policy
 accumula
 uh
 uh
 accommodation


is
 the
 access
 to
 to
 to
 money.
 Fiscal


policy


is
 the
 uh
 flow
 of
 money
 from
 from
 the


state
 and
 that
 was
 done
 in
 a
 coordinated


manner
 makes
 a
 huge
 difference
 whether


individual
 countries
 do
 their
 individual


thing
 or
 the
 world
 comes
 together
 with
 a


strong
 uh
 coordinated
 uh
 response.


You're
 now
 entering
 your
 second
 term
 at


IMF.
 What
 are
 you
 the
 most
 proud
 of
 from


your
 first
 term?


>> Well,
 co
 I'm
 very
 proud
 of,
 but
 actually


what
 I'm
 most
 proud
 of
 my
 first
 uh
 term


is
 keeping
 the
 membership
 together


despite
 of
 the
 many
 forces
 against
 it.


>> Uh
 take
 u
 Russia's
 invasion
 of
 Ukraine.


The
 fund
 came
 with
 a
 program
 for
 Ukraine


that
 is
 supported
 by
 all
 our
 members


with
 the
 exception
 of
 uh
 Russia.
 and


that
 ability
 to
 bring


the
 collective


for
 this
 purpose
 of
 strengthening
 the


world
 economy
 that
 I'm
 very
 proud
 of.


I'm
 very
 proud
 of
 the
 staff
 of
 the
 fund.


These
 are
 fantastic
 people.
 You
 know
 how


the
 fund
 operates.
 We
 argue
 and
 we
 fight


our
 individual
 positions
 and
 then
 we


come
 to
 a
 decision.
 When
 we
 come
 to
 a


decision,
 that's
 it.
 We
 all
 march
 in
 the


same
 direction.
 There
 is
 u
 it's
 like
 a


little
 economic
 army
 that
 I'm
 in
 charge


of.


You
 grew
 up
 in
 Bulgaria
 in
 the
 50s
 and


the
 60s
 and
 uh
 behind
 the
 iron
 curtain


and
 I
 was
 just
 kind
 of
 thinking
 about


you
 know
 armies
 and
 and
 things
 like


that.
 Just
 how
 was
 your
 upbringing
 like?


>> I
 was
 very
 fortunate
 to
 be
 uh
 a
 kid
 in
 a


loving
 family.
 ordinary
 family.


Materially
 we
 had
 nothing


>> but
 we
 had
 each
 other.
 And
 I


>> You
 say
 ordinary,
 they
 were
 you
 had


quite
 clever
 parents,
 right?


>> Well,
 they
 were
 they
 were
 clever,
 but
 my


mother
 was
 uh
 uh
 worked
 in
 a
 shop
 as
 a


um
 shop
 assistant.
 My
 father
 was
 a
 road


technician
 who
 was
 so
 good
 that
 he
 got


promoted
 to
 be
 in
 a
 position
 of
 an


engineer,
 not
 party
 members.
 In
 other


words,
 not
 part
 of
 the
 elite
 of
 these


days.
 Uh
 but
 I
 would
 be
 coming
 home
 and


I
 would
 we
 lived
 on
 the
 first
 floor
 and


I
 would
 hear
 my
 father
 and
 my
 mother


singing.
 We
 had
 so
 much
 nothing
 that
 uh


we
 didn't
 have
 a
 radio
 until
 I
 think
 I


was
 in
 my
 20s.


>> So
 we
 sang
 and
 that
 was
 wonderful.
 I
 um


uh
 one
 thing
 that
 my
 parents
 gave
 me


that
 I
 am
 forever
 grateful
 uh
 to
 them
 is


the
 encouragement


to
 kind
 of
 never
 give
 up.
 Um
 I
 had
 um


the
 ambition
 to
 study
 journalism.
 That


didn't
 happen
 because
 my
 family
 was
 not


a
 party
 family.
 Uh
 but
 they
 kind
 of


encouraged
 me
 to
 study
 political
 economy


and
 sociology.
 Sociology
 was
 great
 fun


and
 they
 would
 always
 say,
 you
 know,
 you


can
 be
 anything
 you
 want
 to
 be.
 So,
 here


I
 am.


Needless
 to
 say,
 Needless
 to
 say,
 my
 my


parents
 were
 very
 proud
 when
 I
 graduated


from
 university,
 when
 I
 got
 my
 PhD,
 the


first
 in
 our
 extended
 family
 with
 the


PhD
 uh
 degree.
 And
 u
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 have


only
 these
 wonderful
 memories
 of
 u
 uh


growing
 up
 materially
 poor
 but


emotionally
 and
 in
 terms
 of
 education


rich.


>> What
 have
 been
 the
 the
 most
 important


kind
 of
 decisions
 and
 points
 from


growing
 up
 without
 a
 radio
 to
 sitting


here
 in
 this
 fantastic
 studio
 at
 the


IMF.
 you
 know
 the


>> and
 being
 one
 of the
 most
 powerful
 women


in
 the
 world.


>> I
 think
 the
 most
 important
 decisions


were
 me
 deciding
 to
 conquer
 the
 world


outside
 of
 where
 I
 grew
 up.
 I
 went
 to


um
 London
 School
 of
 Economics
 during


Gorbachov's
 time.
 So
 Gorbachovs
 comes
 to


power.
 What
 did
 he
 start?
 Glasnus
 and


Paris
 Striker.
 Glasnus
 meant
 that
 in
 all


former
 socialist
 countries
 we
 were


allowed
 to
 apply
 directly
 for


scholarships
 to
 the
 west.


So
 in
 seven
 months
 I
 learned
 English


enough


to
 get
 a
 British
 council
 scholarship
 and


go
 to
 London
 School
 of
 Economics.


changed
 my
 life
 because
 uh
 when
 I
 came


back
 that
 was
 8788
 when
 I
 came
 back
 to


Bulgaria
 boom
 the
 system
 collapsed
 and
 I


wrote
 the
 first
 microeconomics
 the
 first


microeconomics
 textbooks
 for
 Bulgarian


students
 that
 put
 me
 in
 a
 high
 academic


position
 then
 I
 went
 to
 be
 a
 professor


in
 Fiji


>> which
 in
 these
 days
 just
 imagine


somebody
 from
 Bulgaria
 going
 all
 the
 way


to
 Fiji.
 So
 that
 adventurous
 nature
 that


I
 had,
 that
 incredible
 appetite


to
 see
 the
 world.


>> But
 where
 did
 that
 come
 from?
 But
 I
 mean


not
 not
 many
 people
 uh
 have
 uh
 you
 know


conquer
 the
 world
 uh
 attitude.


>> So
 interesting
 story.
 My
 um
 father
 comes


from
 a
 very
 prominent
 Bulgarian


revolutionary
 family.


So
 I
 can
 trace
 my
 origins
 to
 the
 14th


century,
 something
 very
 rare
 uh
 because


of
 the
 Turkish
 um
 dominance.
 And
 what
 it


meant
 was
 that
 we
 had
 this
 revolutionary


spirit
 in
 my
 in
 our
 uh
 household.
 Um
 I


think
 that
 helped
 me.
 And
 also
 uh
 I


didn't
 tell
 you
 the
 most
 important
 thing


in
 my
 upbringing,
 positivity.
 I've
 never


heard
 my
 mother
 or
 father
 to
 say,
 "No,


you
 can't
 do
 this."


>> What
 about
 your
 energy?
 Because
 when
 I


came
 in
 here,
 I
 asked
 the
 receptionist,


"Hey,
 what
 should
 I
 ask
 your
 managing


director?"
 And
 he
 said,
 "You
