Move 37, when we were building AlphaGo, we were playing one of the best players in the world at the time. Move 37 happened during the second game of the five-game match, where AlphaGo played like a really unexpected, unconventional move that surprised many professional Go players. The commentator said it was, you know, pretty creative, unexpected. And then ultimately, AlphaGo ended up winning that game. An early sign that it can also do something that is truly novel and creative, that you might not expect just from imitating its training data. Creating novel things is actually very easy with language models. The hard part is creating novel things that are useful and interesting.
