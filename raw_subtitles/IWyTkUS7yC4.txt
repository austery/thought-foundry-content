Hi
 everybody.
 Uh,
 welcome
 to
 In
 Good


Company.
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangen,
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 Wealth
 Fund.
 And


today
 we
 have
 the
 founder
 and
 CEO
 of


Figma
 visiting
 us,
 Dylan
 Field.
 Now,


quite
 incredibly,
 uh,
 Dylan
 founded


Figma
 when
 he
 was
 19
 years
 old.
 And
 now


14
 years
 later,
 Figma
 had
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 IPO
 uh,
 IPOs
 of
 2025.
 So,
 warm


welcome.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.


>> So,
 um,
 Dylan,
 we
 have
 to
 start.
 What


does
 Figma
 do?
 Yes.
 So,
 Figma
 is
 a


platform
 that
 helps
 you
 go
 from
 an
 idea


in
 your
 head
 to
 a
 production
 application


uh
 in
 the
 software
 space,
 but
 also
 once


you
 ship
 something
 uh
 once
 you
 ship
 some


software,
 you
 want
 to
 then
 market
 it.


And
 we
 also
 help
 with
 that
 too.


>> We
 help
 you
 get
 your
 brand
 out
 there
 uh


and
 make
 it
 so
 you
 can
 create
 more


collateral
 around
 it.
 And
 ultimately,


it's
 not
 just
 some
 linear
 process
 where


you
 have
 an
 idea
 and
 you
 get
 to
 finish


product
 and
 you're
 done.
 uh
 perhaps
 in


the
 industrial
 design
 world,
 we
 were


talking
 about
 that
 before


>> we
 started,
 that's
 more
 of
 what
 it
 is,


>> but
 in
 software,
 it's
 always
 a
 loop
 and


you're
 always
 iterating
 and
 you're


learning
 and
 you're
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


how
 do
 I
 evolve
 this
 thing
 that
 I've


created
 with
 my
 team
 and
 uh
 we
 try
 to


make
 it
 very
 collaborative
 so
 designers


can
 bring
 their
 entire
 team
 in


>> to
 do
 that.
 Uh


>> so
 listen
 now
 I'm
 I'm
 uh
 I
 run
 a
 cup


factory.
 Okay,
 so
 now
 I'm
 going
 to


design
 a
 new
 cup.
 Uh
 here
 we
 go.
 We
 are


like
 four
 people.
 they
 want
 to
 design
 a


cup.
 How
 do
 we
 use
 your
 software?


>> Uh
 we
 have
 people
 that
 will
 maybe
 draw


cups
 or
 maybe
 they
 will
 market
 their


cups
 on
 Figma,
 but
 we're
 not
 a
 piece
 of


software
 for
 uh
 3D
 or
 you
 know
 CAD


design.
 And
 so
 that's
 typically
 not
 what


people
 use
 for.
 But
 I'm
 always
 amazed


when
 people
 will
 draw
 3D
 assets
 like
 a


beautiful
 cup
 with
 a
 amazing
 shadow
 and


incredible
 lighting
 in
 Figma.
 Not
 what


it's
 made
 for,
 but
 people
 do
 it.
 M


>> that
 said
 uh
 yeah
 CAD
 is
 an
 entirely


different
 area
 and
 we
 really
 stick
 to


digital
 design.


>> Why
 is
 um
 why
 is
 design
 such
 an


important
 differentiator?


>> So
 I
 think
 going
 back
 a
 bit
 uh
 and


speaking
 about
 digital
 product
 design


the


history
 of
 design
 I
 think
 is
 interesting


in
 the
 digital
 realm
 because
 for
 a
 long


time
 there
 were
 very
 very
 few
 designers.


Almost
 none
 of
 them
 had
 a
 traditional


art
 school
 background
 or
 very
 few
 did.


And
 many
 of
 them
 randomly
 found
 their


way
 into
 design.


>> Sometimes
 from
 engineering,
 sometimes


they
 were
 in
 a
 band
 and
 made
 a
 poster.


Uh
 it
 could
 come
 from
 any
 different


place.
 But
 there's
 a
 period
 of
 time
 in


uh
 for
 example
 2000
 uh
 the
 dot
 era
 where


the
 mantra
 was
 build
 it
 and
 they
 will


come.
 And
 at
 that
 point,
 if
 you
 had
 a


designer,
 which
 was
 rare,


the
 sort
 of
 role
 of
 design
 was
 conceived


to
 be
 what
 uh
 sometimes
 in
 America
 we


call
 lipstick
 on
 a
 pig.
 The
 uh
 you
 know,


you
 got
 a
 pig,
 but
 we're
 going
 to
 put


some
 lipstick
 on
 it
 to
 make
 it
 pretty.


And
 it
 was
 really
 about
 making
 it
 uh


aesthetically
 pleasing,
 but
 not
 thinking


about
 the
 function,
 the
 form,
 how
 it


works.
 M


>> and
 that
 has
 changed
 dramatically
 over


the
 past
 25
 years.


>> First
 we
 got
 to
 the
 2010
 era
 where
 you


not
 only
 have
 Apple
 evangelizing
 design


and
 saying
 how
 it
 works
 matters.
 this
 is


why
 you
 should
 buy
 this
 iPhone
 with


Steve
 Jobs
 championing
 design.
 But
 also


you
 have
 the
 advent
 of
 consumer


applications
 like
 Facebook
 or
 Gmail


>> and
 suddenly
 the
 expectations
 rise
 and


at
 the
 same
 time
 you
 know
 things
 like


AWS
 cloud
 computing
 are
 starting
 to
 pick


up
 and
 we've
 moved
 from
 a
 world
 of


managed
 servers
 to
 cloud
 from
 box


software
 to
 app
 stores
 and
 it's
 easier


than
 ever
 uh
 to
 build
 software
 as
 well.


Because
 developer
 tools
 are
 improving.


>> And
 as
 all
 this
 is
 happening,
 what's


happening
 to
 the
 distribution?
 Well,
 no


longer
 are
 we
 in
 the
 world
 of
 build
 and


they
 will
 come.
 Uh
 we're
 starting
 to


transition
 out
 of
 that
 into
 a
 world


where
 well,
 if
 you
 build
 it
 and
 you
 have


really
 great
 design
 and
 really
 great


marketing,
 then
 you
 might
 have
 a
 chance


uh
 because
 there's
 more
 software
 and


it's
 not
 the
 case
 anymore
 that
 you're


building
 something.
 It's
 the
 only
 thing


like
 that
 that
 exists
 in
 the
 world.


competition
 is
 increasing
 and
 the
 value


is
 moving
 up
 the
 stack.


>> Now
 your
 initial
 goal
 was
 to
 I
 think
 you


say
 eliminate
 the
 gap
 between


imagination
 and
 reality.
 What
 does
 that


mean?


>> Yeah.
 So
 when
 we
 started
 uh
 I
 painted
 a


pretty
 broad
 vision
 for
 where
 we
 could


go
 partially
 because
 I
 didn't
 know


exactly
 where
 we
 were
 going
 to
 go.
 Uh


you
 know
 we
 had
 a
 hammer
 that
 was
 WebGL.


And
 I
 think
 that
 there's
 always
 this
 uh


why
 now
 for
 great
 companies.
 Something's


changed
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 the
 why
 now
 is


uh
 something
 you
 can
 look
 back
 on
 and


you
 can
 point
 at
 one
 or
 two
 or
 three
 of


them


>> and
 say
 this
 is
 why
 this
 company
 came
 to


exist
 at
 this
 particular
 time.


>> And
 for
 us
 we
 thought
 okay
 let's
 look
 at


technology
 that's
 changing.
 We're


computer
 scientists.
 Uh
 my
 co-founder


Evan
 he
 is
 beyond
 brilliant.
 He
 was
 my


TA
 at
 Brown
 and
 he
 had
 done
 quite
 a
 lot


of
 exploration
 into
 WebGL.
 Uh
 Evan
 is


not
 just
 a
 10x
 better
 engineer
 than
 I


am.
 He's
 like
 a
 100x
 better
 better


engineer
 than
 I
 am.
 M
 uh


>> you
 called
 him
 Jesus
 or
 something,


right?


>> Uh
 well,
 I
 did
 not
 call
 him
 Jesus.
 Uh


but
 that
 was
 his
 nickname
 in
 middle


school
 was
 computer
 Jesus
 or
 CJ
 for


short.
 Uh
 I
 later
 learned
 um
 I
 called


him
 Evan.
 Uh
 but
 uh
 he
 is
 a
 brilliant


man


>> and
 I
 was
 very
 very
 lucky
 to
 get
 to
 work


with
 him
 and
 uh
 I
 mean
 design
 is
 some


right
 brain
 stuff
 right
 but
 you
 have


your
 background
 also
 in
 like
 in
 math
 and


physics.
 Uh
 so
 why
 is
 rigor
 so
 important


here?


>> Yeah,
 I
 wish
 I
 had
 done
 more
 physics.


Um,
 I
 can't
 claim
 that.
 I've
 done
 some


math,
 but
 not
 enough.
 And
 I
 think
 that


you
 both
 want
 the
 ability
 to
 think
 in


abstraction
 in
 design
 as
 well
 as
 the


ability
 to
 have
 the
 EQ
 and
 emotionally


connect
 with
 the
 end
 user.
 And
 so,
 uh,


of
 course
 there's
 also
 aesthetic,


there's
 judgment,
 there's
 thinking


about,
 uh,
 things
 temporally,
 there's


thinking
 about
 frameworks.
 Uh
 but
 there


yeah
 there's
 many
 skills
 that
 come


together
 in
 order
 to
 understand
 all
 that


context
 and
 to
 bring
 into
 one
 place
 and


to
 create
 a
 great
 user
 experience.


>> And
 we're
 not
 even
 getting
 to
 sort
 of


the
 top
 of
 the
 pyramid
 of
 the
 mass


hierarchy
 of
 needs
 for
 design
 where
 you


start
 to
 think
 about
 delight
 and
 joy
 and


what
 does
 it
 mean
 to
 make
 something
 that


people
 love.
 Uh
 and
 that's
 I
 think
 more


of
 the
 art
 of
 it.
 Uh
 not
 many
 people
 can


do
 that
 but
 when
 you
 can
 when
 you
 can


apply
 that
 craft
 it's
 so
 special
 and


those


out.
 So
 if
 you
 were
 to
 kind
 of
 distill


down
 the
 design
 principles
 of
 Figma,
 do


you
 do
 you
 have
 such


>> we
 have
 many
 I
 mean


>> would
 they
 be
 if


>> some
 of
 the
 ones
 that
 I
 think
 that
 a
 lot


uh
 one
 is
 keep
 the
 simple
 things
 simple


but
 make
 the
 complex
 things
 possible.


>> So
 in
 Figma
 as
 with
 any
 tool


especially
 software
 where
 you're


constantly
 updating
 and
 you're
 adding


more
 things
 to
 respond
 to
 the
 market


we're
 not
 talking
 about
 like
 a
 hammer.


We're
 talking
 about
 something
 that
 is
 a


complex
 uh
 ecosystem
 of
 operations
 and


functionality
 and
 you
 want
 it
 to
 be
 a


staircase
 where
 you
 can
 take
 that
 first


step
 or
 the
 second
 step
 very
 easily
 but


then
 if
 you
 keep
 going
 you
 can
 actually


achieve
 mastery


>> and
 that
 mastery
 is
 so
 important.
 So
 we


want
 to
 make
 it
 so
 that
 there's
 a


balance
 between
 power
 and
 simplicity
 at


all
 times.
 That
 balance
 is
 extremely


hard
 to
 achieve.
 So
 we
 have
 to


constantly
 remind
 ourselves
 and
 our


users
 and
 our
 team
 of
 this
 that
 we
 need


to
 make
 those
 right
 trade-offs
 because


approachability
 is
 I
 think
 a
 flip
 side


of
 it
 which
 is
 you
 come
 into
 Figma.
 Does


it
 feel
 like
 an
 inviting
 environment?


Are
 you
 welcomed
 or
 do
 you
 go
 oh
 my
 gosh


this
 is
 like
 stepping
 into
 an
 airplane


cockpit.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 to
 fly.
 We


want
 it
 to
 be
 that
 you're
 welcomed
 of


course.


>> So
 you
 but
 you
 and
 you
 welcome
 a
 lot
 of


people
 right?
 You
 got
 like
 a
 huge


community.
 Um
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 kind
 of


plug-in
 solutions.
 Just
 how
 do
 you
 think


about
 that
 whole
 ecosystem?
 So
 from
 the


start,
 the
 community
 has
 been
 critical


for
 Figma.
 We
 are
 so
 lucky
 to
 have
 an


amazing
 design
 community
 around
 us
 and


they
 gave
 us
 feedback
 and
 attention
 when


frankly
 we
 had
 no
 reason
 for
 them
 to.
 Uh


you
 know
 I
 would
 cold
 email
 designers


that
 were
 my
 heroes
 at
 the
 start
 of


Figma
 and
 just
 ask
 them
 to
 check
 out


this
 thing
 I
 built


>> and
 they
 would
 sit
 down
 with
 me.
 and
 I'd


get
 them
 a
 coffee
 and
 they
 would
 give
 me


like
 an
 hour-ong
 master
 class
 on
 not


just
 design
 but
 advice
 on
 how
 to
 go


build
 the
 tool
 that
 they
 wanted.


>> So,
 how
 do
 they
 help
 you
 develop


products
 now?


>> Well,
 so
 many
 ways.
 Uh
 we
 try
 to
 be
 very


tapped
 into
 our
 community.
 So,


>> and
 who
 are
 these
 community
 people?
 What


what
 type
 of
 people
 are
 they?


>> Uh
 well,
 designers,
 like
 I
 said,
 come


from
 all
 backgrounds,
 but
 uh
 we've
 got


um
 over
 80%
 of
 our
 weekly
 active
 users


outside
 the
 United
 States.
 And
 so
 it's


not
 necessarily
 like
 just
 United
 States,


it's
 everywhere
 in
 the
 world.
 Uh
 and
 we


have
 friends
 of
 Figma
 chapters,
 user


groups
 all
 over
 the
 place
 too
 that
 are


community-led.
 We
 also
 try
 to
 gather


people
 together
 in
 one
 place
 every
 year


for
 our
 annual
 user
 conference
 config.


We're
 free
 for
 education.
 So
 student


communities
 are
 extremely
 important
 to


us


>> because
 they're
 the
 future
 and
 they
 are


always
 teaching
 us
 about
 what
 we
 need
 to


go
 do
 in
 order
 to
 meet
 their
 needs


because
 they're
 always
 a
 little
 bit


ahead
 of
 everybody
 else.
 Mhm.


>> Um
 but
 yeah,
 we
 also
 have
 online
 forums.


We've
 got
 uh
 we're
 always
 trying
 to


monitor
 and
 uh
 respond
 and
 engage
 on


social
 media
 and
 uh
 we
 also
 do
 a
 lot
 of


qualitative
 and
 quantitative
 research


and
 so
 all
 that
 along
 with
 just
 the


standard
 sales
 process
 uh
 creates


dialogue
 and
 creates
 conversation
 lets


us
 tap
 into
 the
 headsp
 space
 of
 our


customers.


>> How
 will
 AI
 change
 all
 this?
 Well,
 I


think
 AI
 is
 a
 ch
 force
 that
 will
 change


everything,
 of
 course,
 and
 um
 you
 know


exactly
 how
 much.
 That's
 what
 we're
 both


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 all
 the
 time.
 But
 I


believe
 that
 AI
 will
 both
 lower
 the


floor,
 make
 it
 so
 that
 more
 people
 can


come
 into
 the
 design
 process,
 but
 also


raise
 the
 ceiling,
 make
 it
 so
 that


creative
 professionals,
 designers
 will


be
 able
 to
 do
 so
 much
 more
 uh
 than
 they


ever
 could
 before
 and
 truly
 uh
 be
 able


to
 lean
 into
 their
 craft
 because
 I
 think


what
 AI
 does
 is
 it
 makes
 it
 so
 that
 you


can
 explore
 an
 entire
 option
 space
 uh
 of


what
 you
 can
 build,
 what
 you
 can
 design,


And
 then
 from
 that
 option
 space,
 you
 can


sample.
 You
 can
 see
 what
 resonates,
 what


you
 think
 is
 great,
 what
 you
 think


actually
 you
 shouldn't
 go
 into.
 You
 can


use
 that
 to
 figure
 out
 a
 direction
 and


then
 you
 can
 push
 further
 in
 that


direction.
 Whereas
 if
 you
 were
 going
 to


do
 it
 without
 AI,
 you
 could
 only
 sample


a
 few
 points
 from
 that
 option
 space.
 AI


lets
 you
 sample
 more.


>> So
 that
 way
 you
 can
 have
 more


intentionality
 about
 the
 path
 you


choose.


>> How
 important
 is
 taste
 in
 this
 new


world?


>> I
 think
 it's
 incredibly
 important.
 Going


back
 to
 the
 uh
 question
 earlier,
 um


design
 as
 a
 differentiator,
 I
 believe


that
 is
 like
 the
 world
 we
 are
 in
 and


people
 don't
 fully
 appreciate
 yet.


>> This
 has
 been
 my
 thesis
 for
 the
 past


decade.
 It's
 not
 just
 an
 AI
 thing,
 but


AI
 accelerates
 it
 because
 we're
 on
 an


exponential
 curve
 of
 the
 amount
 of


software
 in
 the
 world
 right
 now.


>> What
 is
 taste?


>> Uh
 this
 is
 a
 whole
 podcast
 in
 itself.


Um,
 I
 think
 that
 uh
 taste
 is


a
 loop
 that
 you're
 in
 where
 you
 are


always
 trying
 to
 develop
 an


understanding
 of
 what
 resonates
 with
 you


and
 what
 doesn't.
 And
 based
 on
 that,


you're
 trying
 to
 create
 frameworks
 to


figure
 out
 what
 it
 is
 that
 you
 value,


how
 it
 connects
 to
 your
 uh
 not
 just


aesthetic
 values,
 but
 your
 personal


inner
 values.
 and
 based
 on
 that
 working


to
 express
 that
 in
 a
 form
 that
 others


can
 consume.


uh
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 not
 just


discriminating
 in
 terms
 of
 I
 like
 this,


I
 don't
 like
 that,
 but
 also
 taste
 is
 uh


an
 enabler
 of
 building
 amazing
 things


and
 it
 is
 the
 hardest
 skill
 to
 develop


uh
 to
 have
 good
 taste,
 but
 also
 it
 is
 I


think
 it
 just
 brings
 richness
 to
 your


life
 in
 a
 way
 that
 uh
 I
 don't
 think


everyone
 appreciates
 yet.
 And
 the
 other


thing
 is
 taste


>> what
 what
 is
 Dylan
 Field's
 taste


>> on
 what?


>> Open-ended
 question.


>> Well,
 um
 I
 care
 a
 lot
 about
 complexity


and
 being
 able
 to
 understand
 the
 world.


So
 I
 think
 I've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 taste
 when


it
 comes
 to
 framework
 building
 mental


models.
 Uh
 that
 applies
 to
 design
 as


well.
 If
 you
 can
 clearly
 communicate
 a


mental
 model
 to
 a
 user
 in
 a
 visual
 form,


uh
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 great
 thing.
 And
 not


everyone's
 able
 to
 do
 that
 properly


because
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it,


if
 I
 design
 the
 right
 chair
 for
 you,
 for


example,
 that
 might
 not
 be
 the
 right


chair
 for
 me.
 You
 know,
 we've
 got


different
 bodies.
 Uh
 and
 perhaps,
 you


know,
 we
 could
 create
 something
 custom


for
 both
 of
 us.
 And
 yet
 there's
 a
 reason


why
 we
 create
 the
 same
 software
 for


everyone.
 Uh
 and
 there's
 a
 reason
 why


beyond
 mass
 production
 we
 lean
 into
 how


to
 create
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 same
 chair
 in


a
 bigger
 run.


It's
 I
 think
 uh
 this
 opportunity
 to


actually
 apply
 craft
 and
 figure
 out
 what


is
 it
 that
 you
 can
 do
 to
 as
 an


expression
 of
 yourself
 put
 something


into
 the
 digital
 or
 physical
 world.
 Does


AI
 have
 taste?


>> I
 think
 AI
 is
 still
 a
 pattern
 matching


machine.
 Uh,
 and
 humans
 have
 taste
 and


it's
 been
 trained
 in
 the
 data.
 And
 so
 if


you
 can
 RHF
 the
 right
 parts
 of
 AI,
 you


can
 emulate
 taste.
 But
 that's
 only
 with


advanced
 prompting
 that
 you
 can
 access


it.
 And
 so
 perhaps
 prompters
 have
 taste


and
 can
 pull
 it
 out
 of
 this
 pattern


matching
 machine
 with
 a
 sophisticated


large
 model.
 Uh,
 but
 I
 think
 that's
 not


the
 end
 of
 the
 journey.
 I
 I
 generally


think
 the
 first
 prompt
 that
 people
 do
 is


only
 the
 starting
 point
 and
 instead
 you


need
 to
 keep
 going
 and
 that
 could
 be
 you


know
 we
 have
 a
 product
 called
 Figma
 make


prompt
 to
 working
 application
 and
 one


thing
 we
 do
 with
 Figma
 make
 is
 make
 it


so
 that
 you
 can
 go
 from
 the
 code
 output


and
 copy
 it
 into
 Figma
 design
 which
 is
 a


free
 form
 design
 tool
 not
 attached
 to


code.
 The
 reason
 we
 do
 that
 is
 so
 that


way
 you
 can
 explore
 in
 this
 more
 open


way
 across
 a
 digital
 canvas
 that's


infinite


>> and
 you
 can
 riff
 and
 you
 can
 explore
 in


a
 nonlinear
 way
 all
 sorts
 of
 variations


to
 really
 figure
 out
 visually
 and
 reason


visually
 about
 what
 it
 is
 that
 resonates


with
 you
 what
 feels
 right
 what
 doesn't


feel
 right
 uh
 what
 solves
 your
 problems


how
 do
 you
 constraint
 solve
 for
 the


different
 outcomes
 and
 the
 more
 that
 you


do
 that
 the
 more
 you
 realize
 okay
 I
 have


this
 path
 but
 it
 has
 this
 trade-off,
 I


have
 this
 path,
 it
 has
 this
 other


trade-off.
 You
 don't
 actually
 understand


that
 until
 you
 see
 those
 branching
 paths


of
 where
 things
 can
 go.


>> What
 what
 what
 part
 of
 this
 process
 is


it
 that
 AI
 can't
 replicate?


>> I
 think
 that
 the
 context
 that
 designers


have
 uh
 is
 extremely
 hard,
 perhaps


impossible
 to
 replicate.


>> So,
 think
 about
 yourself.
 You
 have
 a


lived
 context.
 You
 have
 your
 identity,


but
 also
 all
 of
 your
 experiences.


You
 have
 all
 sorts
 of
 things
 you've


interacted
 with
 in
 the
 physical
 world


across
 your
 life.
 You're
 part
 of
 various


cultures
 that
 you
 intersect
 with
 and


interact
 with.
 Uh
 and
 you
 come
 with


mental
 models
 informed
 by
 the
 languages


that
 you've
 learned.
 Uh
 and
 from
 there


you're
 coming
 into
 an
 experience
 being


used
 to
 other
 experiences.
 Uh
 and
 then


the
 designer's
 task
 is
 to
 create


something
 for
 you
 that
 also
 applies
 to


others.
 And
 it's
 a
 thing
 of
 the
 moment.


It
 is
 related
 to
 the
 culture
 of
 the


moment.
 And
 it
 also
 needs
 to
 achieve


business
 goals.
 It
 needs
 to
 be
 something


that's
 testable.
 And
 that
 based
 on
 those


tests,
 you
 can
 iterate
 on
 it.
 But
 you


don't
 want
 to
 get
 to
 a
 local
 max.
 You


want
 to
 get
 to
 the
 global
 max.
 And
 uh
 I


I
 just
 don't
 think
 that
 AI
 is
 very
 close


to
 doing


>> that
 task
 yet.
 uh
 it's
 definitely
 not


close
 to
 the
 point
 of
 getting
 to
 where


you
 can
 actually
 have
 AI
 do
 deep
 user


research
 and
 understand
 the
 problems
 and


the
 needs
 of
 the
 end
 customer.


>> Do
 you
 think
 taste
 around
 the
 world
 will


diverge
 or
 come
 together?


>> So,
 I
 went
 to
 China
 in
 2016.
 I've
 only


been
 there
 once.
 Uh
 and
 amazing
 culture,


the
 most
 uh
 hospitality
 I've
 ever
 found


in
 the
 world.
 And
 uh
 the
 people
 I
 met


were
 just
 incredible.
 You
 ride
 the


subway
 there
 and
 you
 look
 at
 uh
 the
 way


that
 people
 use
 mobile
 applications
 and


the
 way
 they're
 designed


and
 they're
 just
 completely
 different
 in


the
 United
 States.
 The
 density
 of
 the


typography,
 the
 bias
 towards
 a
 super
 app


uh
 and
 the
 way
 that
 people
 are
 are
 in


general
 interacting
 with
 technology


there.
 Yeah,
 it's
 it's
 just
 completely


different.
 So
 I
 think
 the
 divergence


already
 exists
 first
 of
 all.


>> Mhm.


>> Uh
 I
 think
 the
 counter
 example
 would
 be


Hollywood
 where
 somehow
 uh
 we've
 got


this
 American
 export
 of
 media
 that
 has


become
 a
 global
 phenomenon.
 M


>> and
 even
 in
 today's
 age
 where
 more


content
 is
 being
 created
 bottoms
 up


across
 the
 world,
 Hollywood
 and
 the
 uh


sort
 of
 American
 media
 complex
 has


incredible
 enormous
 reach


>> and
 ability
 to
 influence
 culture.
 And
 so


I
 think
 that
 perhaps
 uh
 for
 the
 lowest


common
 denominator
 of
 taste
 that's


something
 that
 is
 pervasive
 and
 more


uniform.
 But
 I
 think
 as
 you
 start
 to
 go


into
 any
 given
 niche,
 which
 I
 think


we'll
 see
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 those
 niches


going
 forward,
 we
 already
 are,
 then
 I


think
 that
 those
 subcultures
 create


their
 own
 aesthetic,
 their
 own
 point
 of


view
 uh
 and
 sort
 of
 their
 own
 language


and
 sometimes
 around
 uh
 what
 they
 are


valuing
 and
 how
 they
 see
 the
 world.


>> What
 is
 design
 going
 to
 look
 like
 in
 10


years
 time?
 10
 years
 is
 a
 long
 time
 to


make
 predictions
 about
 right
 now
 in
 a


world
 where
 AI
 is
 a
 chaotic
 force
 that


uh
 could
 be
 exponential
 but
 then
 if
 you


really
 draw
 that
 exponential
 the
 earth


is
 covered
 every
 square
 inch
 of
 data


centers
 uh
 so
 something
 might
 not


eventually
 keep
 up
 with
 the
 exponential


or
 perhaps
 we
 have
 data
 centers
 in
 space


I
 don't
 know
 in
 any
 case
 I
 believe
 that


the
 role
 of
 design
 will
 continue
 to
 uh


elevate
 And


what
 are
 the
 real
 moes
 in
 software?
 Now


I
 think
 that
 uh
 liquidity
 liquidity
 of


data
 liquidity
 in
 a
 marketplace
 uh


liquidity
 of
 social
 interaction


um
 those
 are
 modes.


There
 are
 businesses
 where


you
 have
 these
 individuals
 interacting


in
 a
 certain
 way
 uh
 or
 there's


regulatory
 constraints
 that
 could
 be
 a


moat.
 But
 we
 can
 name
 many
 more.
 But
 in


general,
 I
 think
 that
 a
 lot
 less


software
 has
 modes
 than
 in
 the
 past.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 also
 software
 is
 so
 much
 easier
 to


create.


Now,
 I'm
 not
 of
 the
 mind
 that
 you're


going
 to
 go
 and
 uh
 vibe
 code
 your
 way
 to


Salesforce
 or
 Workday.
 I
 think
 the


people
 that
 are
 saying
 that
 right
 now


are
 maybe
 extrapolating
 a
 bit
 too
 much.


But
 I
 think
 in
 general
 we're
 going
 to
 uh


see
 so
 much
 more
 competition
 and
 design


will
 be
 a
 huge
 part
 of
 why
 you
 win
 or


lose
 as
 will
 craft
 as
 will
 point
 of
 view


>> but
 it
 seems
 like
 vibe
 coding
 is
 tailing


off
 a
 bit
 but
 you
 are
 not
 tailing
 off.


>> Yeah
 we
 have
 seen
 it
 continue
 to
 grow.


Um,
 and
 for
 Figma,
 I
 think
 that
 the


opportunity
 to
 help
 in
 the
 B2B
 context,


designers,
 product
 managers,
 anyone


adjacent
 to
 designer


>> be
 able
 to
 prototype
 in
 an
 easier
 way
 as


well
 as
 get
 things
 into
 production
 or


make
 an
 internal
 app.
 Uh,
 that
 is
 a
 use


case
 that's
 just
 starting.
 So,
 I
 think


it's
 bifurcated.
 There's
 a
 consumer


aspect
 too
 and
 we
 care
 about
 that
 of


course.
 I
 mean
 getting
 people
 the
 access


to
 design,
 their
 ability
 to
 create
 and


express
 that's
 so
 so
 important
 to
 us.


>> And
 also
 uh
 I
 believe
 that
 um
 you
 know


our
 focus
 right
 now
 and
 the
 thing
 that


we
 are
 really
 trying
 to
 make
 sure
 that


we
 are
 world
 class
 at
 is
 more
 of
 that


B2B
 side
 because
 I
 think
 it
 transfers


over
 the
 consumer
 side
 later
 on.


>> How
 important
 is
 the
 integration
 with


the
 chatb?


>> Chat
 is
 a
 learning
 moment
 for
 us
 still.


So
 we
 are
 exploring
 that
 in
 the
 context


of
 Fig
 Jim,
 our
 whiteboarding,


diagramming,
 brainstorming
 product.


>> And
 uh
 it's
 been
 really
 cool
 to
 see
 how


people
 are
 using
 the
 context
 they
 create


in
 these
 chatbt
 sessions


>> in
 order
 to
 then
 bring
 into
 Fig
 Jam
 uh


with
 our
 Figma
 app
 on
 Chat
 GBT
 and
 we're


learning
 a
 lot.
 It's
 it's
 too
 early
 to


to
 really
 give
 an
 answer
 there.


>> How
 is
 um
 AI
 changing
 the
 way
 you
 lead


the
 company?
 So
 I
 think
 that
 it's
 really


important
 that
 not
 just
 our
 R&D
 team
 but


the
 company
 in
 general
 have
 AI
 fluency


and


this
 doesn't
 just
 mean
 like
 cost
 cutting


because
 I
 think
 there's
 sort
 of
 two


frameworks
 people
 come
 from
 when
 it


comes
 to
 AI.
 Uh,
 and
 I
 I
 always
 think


back
 to
 uh
 this
 dinner
 I
 was
 at
 maybe


nine
 months
 ago,
 10
 months
 ago
 with
 a


neighbor.
 And
 uh
 they
 have
 two


teenagers,


uh,
 a
 boy
 and
 a
 girl,
 both
 in
 high


school.
 And


the
 question
 at
 the
 dinner
 table
 was,


"How
 do
 you
 use
 AI?"


And
 the
 son
 says,
 "Well,
 I
 I
 get
 to
 hang


out
 with
 my
 friends
 more.
 I
 get
 to
 work


out
 more.
 Uh,
 love
 an
 AI.
 It's
 doing
 a


lot
 of
 my
 homework
 for
 me.
 It's
 great."


The
 daughter
 goes,
 "Yeah,
 it's
 been


really,
 really
 helpful.
 I
 have
 used
 it


to
 generate
 3x
 the
 problem
 sets
 so
 I
 can


really
 study
 for
 the
 tests
 ahead.
 Uh,


and
 it's
 been
 amazing
 as
 a
 learning


assistant
 for
 me."


>> I
 suspect
 you
 are
 in
 the
 letter
 camp.


>> Yeah,
 I'm
 much
 more
 in
 the
 like
 I
 want


to
 learn
 as
 much
 as
 possible
 from


everything,
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 applicable


to
 companies,
 too.
 Yeah.


>> I'm
 not
 saying
 it's
 an
 either
 or.
 You


can
 do
 both.
 But
 are
 you
 going to
 be


exclusively
 focused
 on
 cost
 cutting


>> or
 are
 you
 going
 to
 look
 for
 the
 new


opportunities
 that
 AI
 enables?


>> Well,
 so
 I
 think
 if
 you
 focus
 in
 on
 cost


cutting
 too
 early,
 you're
 just
 going
 to


slow
 down
 the
 whole
 process
 because


people
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 uh
 you
 know
 cut.


>> Well,
 that
 too.
 Uh
 but
 I
 also
 think
 that


there's
 an
 opportunity
 to
 make
 it
 that


people
 are
 more
 productive


>> but
 also
 doing
 their
 job
 in
 a
 better


way.


>> Yeah.
 Does
 it
 have
 implications?
 Going


back
 to
 raising
 the
 ceiling,


>> does
 it
 have
 implications
 for
 what


implications
 does
 it
 have
 for
 who
 you


hire?


>> So
 you
 know
 how
 many
 people?
 You
 are
 1,


how
 many00?


>> About
 1,800ish


>> 1,800
 now.
 So
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 for
 who


you
 hire?


>> You
 know,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 uh
 one
 of
 the


critical
 debates
 that
 the
 software


industry
 is
 going
 through
 right
 now
 is


does
 AI
 mean
 that
 you
 should
 hire
 senior


people
 or
 middle
 level
 or
 junior
 or
 or


all
 the
 jobs
 going
 to
 go
 away
 because
 AI


will
 replace
 them
 all.
 Uh
 I've
 heard


that
 one
 the
 last
 one
 a
 bunch
 of
 times


and
 then
 it
 hasn't
 come
 true
 yet.
 All


the
 people
 have
 said
 that
 they
 continue


to
 hire.
 So
 I
 my
 bias
 actually
 is
 a
 lot


more
 towards
 the
 junior
 folks.
 And
 I


think
 that
 people
 that
 are
 younger
 are


AI
 native
 in
 a
 way
 that
 folks
 that
 are


older
 uh
 have
 to
 learn.
 And
 that
 doesn't


mean
 that
 we
 don't
 hire
 a
 mix.
 We
 do.
 Uh


we've
 always
 had
 a
 mix
 of
 you
 know


seniority
 levels
 at
 Figma.
 But
 I
 think


that
 it
 is
 important
 that
 people
 come
 in


first
 of
 all
 knowing
 that
 we're
 pushing


full
 steam
 ahead
 into
 the
 AI
 era.
 So
 if


you
 have
 a
 bias
 against
 AI,
 that's
 a


great
 dinner
 table
 conversation
 between


us,
 but
 we're
 very
 focused
 on
 making


sure
 that
 we
 build
 for
 this
 AI
 age.


>> What's
 the
 average
 age
 of
 your
 people?


>> Uh
 I
 don't
 have
 that
 number
 off
 hand.


>> What
 do
 you
 think?


>> I
 would
 guess
 about
 uh
 35
 36.


>> Okay.
 Does
 it
 have
 any
 implications
 for


um
 the
 pool
 you
 hire
 from?
 Is
 it


narrower
 or
 wider
 than
 before?


>> The
 pool
 we're
 hiring
 from
 has
 only


grown
 wider
 over
 time.
 Uh
 been
 kind
 of


incredible
 to
 see
 that
 growth
 because
 I


think
 back
 to
 the
 earliest
 days
 of
 Figma


and
 recruiting
 was
 so
 hard.


>> No,
 but
 I
 mean
 you
 I'm
 sure
 you've
 got


thousands
 of
 people
 applying
 but
 the


type
 of
 people,
 the
 type
 of
 educational


background
 that
 they
 have,
 has
 that


changed
 at
 all?


>> No,
 we
 don't.
 um
 I
 made
 sure
 that
 we


don't
 look
 at
 degrees


uh
 as
 part
 of
 the
 hiring
 process.
 So,
 uh


perhaps
 there's
 bias
 that
 slips
 in


somewhere,
 but
 my
 point
 of
 view
 is
 that


it
 shouldn't
 matter
 whether
 you've


graduated
 college
 or
 not
 because
 coming


from
 my
 own
 perspective,
 I
 didn't


graduate
 from
 college.
 uh
 and
 I
 think


that
 unfortunately
 the
 value
 of
 a


college
 degree
 will
 be
 uh
 plummeting
 in


terms
 of
 external
 perception
 not


necessarily
 the
 value
 of
 the
 college


education.


Uh
 I
 think
 that
 college
 will
 be
 a


amazing
 place
 if
 you
 can
 afford
 it.
 But


uh
 that
 said
 I
 think
 that
 you
 know
 going


back
 to
 that
 dinner
 table
 conversation


how
 do
 you
 know
 that
 someone
 actually


learned
 all
 the
 things
 they
 said
 they


did
 from
 their
 diploma?


>> Do
 you
 think
 do
 you
 think
 you
 would
 have


done
 better
 in
 life
 if
 you
 had
 graduated


from
 college?
 Uh
 just
 depends
 on
 the


dimension
 you're
 talking
 about.
 Uh
 you


know
 the
 counterfactual
 joke
 sorry
 the


counterfactual
 is
 always
 hard
 right?
 Uh


but
 um


>> but
 I'm
 sorry.
 But
 so
 when
 you
 hire
 you


you
 don't
 care
 about
 what
 kind
 of
 degree


they
 have
 whether
 they
 are
 like
 a
 doctor


or
 scientist
 or
 you
 know
 economist
 or
 I


mean
 how
 do
 you


>> I
 mean
 look
 we've
 had
 uh
 one
 of
 our


first
 data
 science
 hires
 for example
 he


came
 out
 of
 a
 chem
 chemistry
 PhD.


>> So
 what
 do
 you
 look
 for
 then?
 So


>> we
 look
 for
 the
 skill


>> right?
 And
 uh
 one
 indicator
 of
 that


skill
 can
 be
 formal
 education,


>> but
 also
 projects
 you've
 done,
 job


experiences
 you've
 had,
 uh
 the
 way
 that


you
 spend
 your
 time.
 These
 are
 all


things
 that
 also
 indicate.
 And
 I
 think


what's
 most
 important
 and
 something
 that


I'm
 always
 pushing
 for
 at
 Figma
 is
 how


do
 we
 find
 the
 people
 that
 are
 showing


tremendous
 slope?


>> They're
 improving
 at
 a
 rapid
 rate.
 And


if
 you
 extrapolate
 out,
 uh
 yes,
 it's


high
 beta.
 There's
 some
 risk
 involved.


you
 don't
 know
 if
 they're
 going
 to
 be


A++
 or
 actually
 they
 are
 really
 junior


and
 this
 is
 this
 is
 the
 ceiling.


>> How
 do
 you
 assess
 how
 do
 you
 assess


slope?


>> I
 just
 talk
 to
 people
 about
 their


backgrounds,
 their
 history,
 how
 they've


approached
 different
 decisions
 in
 life


>> and
 understand
 what
 it
 is
 that
 they


value
 and
 how
 they've
 pushed
 themselves


to
 grow.


Uh,
 and
 I
 think
 that
 the
 decisions


people
 make
 historically
 and
 the


consistency
 of
 that
 tells
 you
 a
 lot


about
 uh,
 their
 growth
 mindset
 and
 the


way
 that
 they
 like
 to
 level
 up


>> and
 how
 they
 challenge
 themselves.


>> So,
 I
 always
 want
 people
 with
 a
 growth


mindset
 because
 we're
 always
 growing
 at


Figma.
 We're
 always
 encountering
 new


problems.
 We
 need
 people
 that
 are


adaptable.


>> And,
 uh,
 I
 think
 that,
 yeah,
 it's
 it's


unfortunately
 such
 a
 bias
 on
 the
 human


side.
 This
 is
 for
 all
 humans
 to
 really


look
 at
 somebody
 as
 a
 point
 in
 time
 and


it's
 just
 not
 a
 very
 helpful
 framework.


Instead,
 you
 want
 to
 think
 about,
 okay,


where
 have
 they
 been
 and
 where
 are
 they


going?
 And
 also,
 if
 you
 meet
 someone
 two


years
 after
 you
 met
 them
 the
 first
 time,


it's
 another
 bias
 to
 think
 back
 and
 go,


okay,
 my
 first
 impression,
 that
 is
 who


they
 are
 in
 my
 mind,
 and
 they're
 always


going
 to
 be
 that
 way.
 You
 really
 need
 to


be
 able
 to
 update.
 I've
 certainly
 been


guilty
 of
 that
 uh
 and
 missed
 the


opportunity
 to
 work
 with
 people
 that
 I


would
 have
 loved
 to
 work
 with
 uh
 because


I
 didn't
 update
 fast
 enough.


>> So,
 I
 think
 that's
 something
 I'm
 hyper


aware
 of
 too
 is
 just
 making
 sure
 that


you
 really
 do
 update
 your
 priors
 there.


>> Let's
 um
 if
 we
 just
 move
 back
 to
 uh
 to


the
 moment
 when
 you
 dropped
 out
 of
 uh


Brown.
 So,
 you
 you
 applied
 for
 this
 um


the
 fellowship,
 right?


>> I
 think
 you
 wrote
 in
 your
 application


that
 you
 hated
 chocolate.
 So
 you're


quite
 famous
 for


>> one
 of
 the
 most
 famous
 chocolate
 haters


uh
 in
 the
 United
 States.


>> There
 are
 several
 of
 us


>> now.
 Um
 how
 did
 you
 have
 the
 conviction


of
 dropping
 out
 of
 college
 at
 age
 20?


>> You
 know
 I
 didn't.
 Um
 I
 had
 conviction


that
 I
 needed
 to
 go
 explore
 design


>> and
 so
 I
 had
 signed
 up
 to
 go
 work
 at


Flipboard
 a
 second
 time.
 first
 time
 I


was
 a
 software
 engineering
 intern
 and


doing
 some
 data
 science
 work
 and


recommendation
 engines
 machine
 learning


very
 basic
 machine
 learning
 let
 me
 be


clear
 uh
 and
 then
 they
 were
 willing
 to


have
 me
 back
 and
 have
 me
 on
 the
 design


team
 I
 had
 really
 no
 formal
 design


background
 so
 I
 didn't
 really
 know
 why


they
 were
 open
 to
 it
 but
 I
 was
 uh
 I


didn't
 want
 to
 you
 know
 say
 no
 it
 was
 a


gift
 and
 the
 chance
 to
 work
 with
 them


for
 six
 months
 I
 thought
 this
 will


inform
 my
 studies
 maybe
 I'll
 take
 more


classes
 at
 Risy
 which
 is
 across
 the


street
 from
 Brown


>> and
 uh
 perhaps
 this
 will
 help
 me
 inform


where
 I
 want
 to
 go
 with
 the
 year
 and
 a


half
 left.


>> So
 is
 the
 college
 the
 premier
 design


school
 in
 America,
 right?


>> It's
 an
 incredible


>> incredible
 place.
 And
 I
 wanted
 to
 just


make
 sure
 I
 was
 informing
 my
 studies


right.
 And
 so
 I
 decided
 I'll
 take
 a


semester
 off
 from
 Brown.
 I'll
 graduate,


you
 know,
 instead
 of
 2013
 2013.5.


And
 uh
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 right
 before
 I


was
 about
 to
 leave
 Brown,
 I
 started


talking
 with
 Evan,
 who
 later
 became
 my


co-founder.
 and
 he
 was
 the
 smartest


person
 I'd
 ever
 encountered.
 And
 I
 had


worked
 with
 some
 incredible
 people
 in
 my


internships.
 People
 that
 have
 gone
 on
 to


start,
 you
 know,
 publicly
 traded


companies
 that
 were
 then
 engineers
 who


had
 run
 in
 the
 office,
 run
 into
 the


office
 at
 2
 am
 jarraps,
 for
 example.


That's
 who
 I'm
 thinking
 of
 there,
 uh,


LinkedIn.
 And
 I
 met,
 you
 know,
 people


that
 had,
 uh,
 done
 things
 like
 created


Java,
 the
 programming
 language.
 And,
 uh,


at,
 you
 know,
 22,
 23
 years
 of
 age,
 Evan


was
 up
 there.
 Mhm.


>> Uh
 he
 has
 genius
 level
 talent
 and


insight.
 And
 I
 thought,
 okay,
 if
 there's


a
 chance
 to
 work
 with
 Evan,
 I
 will
 learn


more
 from
 that
 than
 from
 anything
 else
 I


can
 do
 in
 my
 life.
 This
 would
 be
 the


most
 unique
 opportunity
 I
 could
 ever


have.
 And
 so
 I
 asked
 him,
 would
 you
 ever


want
 to
 think
 about
 starting
 a
 company?


And
 I
 was
 very
 surprised
 that
 he
 was


interested.
 And
 from
 there,
 uh
 we


started
 to
 explore.
 And
 I
 didn't
 know
 if


it
 would
 converge,
 but
 I
 applied
 for
 the


tail
 fellowship
 just
 in
 case.
 And
 then


as
 we
 started
 to,
 you
 know,
 every


weekend
 talk
 about
 ideas,
 prototype


things,
 pretty
 quickly
 I
 was
 like,


"Okay,
 well,
 whether
 or
 not
 we
 get
 the


Teal
 Fellowship,
 let's
 go
 do
 this.


>> I
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 savings.
 You


know,
 maybe
 we're
 going
 to
 live
 on
 ramen


and
 live
 in
 a
 bad
 apartment,
 but
 like


we'll
 make
 it
 happen."
 And
 then
 with
 the


Teal
 Fellowship
 and
 the
 ability
 to


actually
 have
 that
 support,
 100K
 over


two
 years,
 that
 made
 it
 a
 nice
 apartment


with
 uh
 Whole
 Foods.
 So
 just
 uh
 to
 fill


in
 here
 for
 people
 who
 don't
 know
 the


the
 partnership
 is
 it's
 made
 by
 Peter


the
 right
 who's
 the
 venture
 capitalist.


Tell
 me
 what's
 the
 fellowship
 about?


>> Yeah
 so
 the
 teal
 fellowship
 uh
 I
 think


of
 it
 as
 a
 way
 to
 uh
 empower
 young


people


>> to
 make
 it
 so
 they
 can
 go
 explore
 ideas


and
 get
 off
 of
 sort
 of
 the
 traditional


tracked
 existence
 that
 many
 folks
 have


earlier
 in
 life.
 And
 I've
 really
 started


to
 frame
 it
 in
 my
 mind
 as
 more
 of
 a
 life


accelerant
 than
 anything
 else.
 Uh
 I


haven't
 done
 like
 a
 study
 of
 it,
 but
 I


actually
 think
 that
 tail
 fells
 on


average
 have
 uh
 they
 get
 married
 faster,


they
 have
 kids
 faster.
 Uh
 you
 know,
 they


end
 up
 in
 the
 place
 that
 they're
 going


to
 go
 anyway,
 but
 just
 on
 a
 much
 quicker


pace.
 So
 there
 are
 te
 fellows
 who
 they


dropped
 out
 of
 undergrad,
 they
 worked
 on


their
 own
 for
 two
 years
 and
 they


actually
 went
 back
 to
 academia
 but
 like


in
 a
 PhD
 program.
 They
 just
 never
 did


the
 undergrad
 thing.


>> Uh
 there
 how
 many
 other
 now?


>> Well,
 there's
 20
 per
 year.
 It's
 been


going
 since
 2011.
 Uh
 the
 I
 think


>> do
 you
 hang
 out
 together?


>> Yeah,
 that
 was
 actually
 a
 critical
 part


of
 the
 fellowship.
 Mhm.


>> The


social
 experience
 I
 had
 after
 uh
 leaving


Brown
 was
 weird.
 Like
 I
 had
 my
 friends


back
 home
 who
 were
 amazing.
 I
 grew
 up
 in


Sonoma
 County,
 so
 it
 wasn't
 that
 far


away
 from
 Palto
 where
 I
 was
 living
 a
 few


hours
 away,
 but
 they
 were
 all
 on
 very


different
 tracks
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


their
 lives
 and
 they're
 all
 all
 their


lives
 were
 going
 divergent
 directions.


And
 I
 had
 my
 friends
 back
 at
 Brown,
 uh,


mostly
 computer
 science
 friends,
 uh,


some
 that
 were
 in
 the
 liberal
 arts
 as


well
 and,
 uh,
 sciences,
 and
 they
 were


all
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 what's
 my
 job


after
 college.


>> Mhm.


>> I
 had
 my
 friends
 from
 Flipboard.
 They


were
 all
 a
 decade
 older
 than
 me
 or
 more.


Uh,
 and
 they
 had
 very
 different
 lives


than
 I
 did.


>> And
 you
 were
 running
 a
 company.


>> Yeah,
 I
 was
 running
 a
 company.
 And


>> 20
 years
 old,
 10
 people.
 So,
 how
 did


they


>> Not
 even
 10
 then.
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 uh,
 it


was
 just
 me
 and
 Evan
 at
 the
 start.
 And


you
 know
 it's
 it's
 existential
 at
 that


point
 in
 time.
 It
 took
 us
 nine
 months
 of


sort
 of
 existential
 looking
 into
 the


void
 uh
 and
 you
 know
 really
 kind
 of


absurdist
 thought
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 we


were
 doing.
 We
 were
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


you
 know
 which
 direction
 we
 go.
 We've


got
 this
 hammer
 of
 WebGL.
 What's
 the


nail?
 And
 we
 just
 kept
 trying
 things.


And


>> so
 you
 spent
 you
 spent
 quite
 in


retrospect
 you've
 said
 that
 you
 you


spent
 four
 years
 building
 the
 product


before
 you
 launched
 right?
 It
 was
 uh


August
 2012
 we
 started
 we
 launched
 our


closed
 beta
 December
 2015
 and
 the
 GA


released
 in
 October
 2016.


>> Didn't
 start
 charging
 till
 summer
 2017.


>> Uh
 but
 yeah
 throughout
 that
 all


>> should
 have
 should
 you
 have
 launched


earlier?


>> Oh
 yeah
 of
 course.


>> And
 how
 well
 did
 you
 have
 anything
 to


launch?


>> Uh
 well
 we
 always
 had
 something
 uh
 the


question
 was
 was
 it
 good
 enough?


>> And
 then
 you
 ask
 okay
 well
 how
 could
 we


have
 moved
 faster
 and


>> and
 were
 you
 just
 a
 perfectionist?


didn't
 want
 to
 launch
 until


>> I'm
 definitely
 a
 perfectionist
 was
 an
 am


I
 have
 to
 constantly
 check
 that
 bias.
 Uh


but
 also
 I
 think
 that
 the


uh
 the
 real
 thing
 we
 could
 to
 move


faster
 is
 we
 should
 have
 hired
 faster


>> and
 to
 hire
 faster
 I
 should
 have
 been


more
 on
 top
 of
 the
 culture
 and
 I
 should


have
 figured
 out
 how
 to
 manage
 people


faster.


>> I
 was
 a
 bad
 manager.


>> Okay.
 But
 did
 you
 have
 the
 capital
 to


hire?
 Could
 you
 have
 hired?


>> We
 did
 have
 the
 capital.


>> There's
 this
 thing
 called
 blit
 scaling,


right?
 You
 you
 want
 to
 scale
 very
 fast.


So
 just
 tell
 me
 how
 how
 were
 you


thinking
 about
 speed
 at
 that
 stage?


>> I
 was
 thinking
 about
 we
 got
 to
 get


everything
 right.
 We
 got
 to
 make
 the


perfect
 tires.
 We
 got
 to
 make
 the


perfect
 product.
 I
 was
 too
 much
 in
 the


mode
 of
 there's
 one
 solution
 to
 things.


There's
 not.
 There's
 often
 many
 many


solutions
 to
 things.
 It's
 rare
 that


there's
 one
 solution.
 And
 I
 think
 I


didn't
 fully
 appreciate
 it
 then.
 And


also
 I
 think
 I
 lacked
 at
 the
 start
 of


the
 company
 the
 rigor
 and
 discipline
 to


every
 day
 many
 times
 a
 day
 be
 looking
 at


that
 recruiting
 funnel
 and
 going
 okay


who's
 in
 process
 where
 are
 they
 in


process
 how
 am
 I
 going
 to
 get
 them
 to


the
 next
 stage
 and
 I
 think
 that
 should


have
 been
 my
 obsession
 instead
 I
 was


obsessed
 with
 the
 product
 and
 I'm
 not


saying
 that
 was
 a
 bad
 thing
 uh
 obviously


I'm
 still
 obsessed
 with
 the
 product
 but


you
 were
 trying
 to
 be
 obsessed
 about


growth


>> so
 you
 should
 have
 been
 spending
 time


hiring
 rather
 than
 writing
 software


>> uh
 I
 think
 I
 should
 have
 been
 doing


both.
 I
 think
 the
 best
 founders
 figure


out
 how
 to
 do
 it
 all
 and
 I
 think
 I


allocated
 my
 time
 entirely
 towards
 the


product.


>> What
 type
 of
 people
 were
 you
 hiring
 at


the
 stage?


>> Engineers,
 designers,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 ops


roles.
 Uh,
 nothing
 that
 was
 too
 out


there.
 But
 yeah,
 I
 think
 that
 um,
 in


retrospect,
 we
 made
 some
 great
 hires


during
 that
 time.
 But
 overall,
 if
 we
 had


hired
 faster
 and
 if
 I
 had
 had
 the


mindset
 I
 have
 now
 back
 then,
 we
 could


have
 built
 it
 a
 lot
 quicker.


>> Can
 you
 can
 you
 hire
 a
 super
 people
 if


you
 hire
 that
 super
 fast?


>> Oh,
 yes.
 Uh
 but
 I
 think
 it
 requires


uh
 a
 recruiting
 muscle
 that
 everyone
 in


the
 company
 has
 to
 embrace.
 Everyone
 has


to
 really
 be
 aligned
 and
 on
 the
 same


page
 that
 we
 have
 to
 go
 find
 and
 ret


get,
 you
 know,
 we
 have
 to
 go
 find
 and
 we


have
 to
 go
 attract
 and
 then
 retain
 the


best
 folks
 in
 the
 world.


>> And
 there's
 a
 momentum
 to
 it.
 If
 you


don't
 have
 the
 momentum,
 if
 you
 don't


have
 the
 ability
 to
 uh
 really
 push
 and


get
 that
 ball
 rolling,
 it
 just
 never


quite
 starts.
 and
 it
 goes
 in
 instead
 in


little
 sprints
 when
 you
 find
 one
 person


and
 you
 really
 have
 to
 parallel
 path
 it.


>> And
 is
 it
 right
 that
 you
 started
 to


charge
 because
 Microsoft
 told
 you
 that


if
 you
 don't
 charge
 we
 can't
 buy
 because


you're
 not
 going
 to
 survive.
 Is
 that


right?


>> Yes,
 it
 is
 the
 story.


It
 was
 a
 surprise
 uh
 when
 I
 mean
 they're


so
 nice
 about
 it.
 Uh
 the
 person
 that


told
 me
 that
 is
 actually
 still
 at


Microsoft
 and
 he's
 just
 a
 wonderful
 guy.


Um,
 but
 yeah,
 they
 came
 to
 our
 office


and
 they're
 like,
 "Hey,
 got
 a
 lot
 of


people
 using
 your
 software.
 It's


starting
 to
 be
 kind
 of
 important
 for
 us.


What's
 your
 business
 model?"
 And
 I'm


like,
 "Oh,
 well,
 we're
 going
 to
 figure


it
 out."
 He
 said,
 "Yeah,
 uh,
 that
 makes


sense.
 Why
 are
 you
 waiting?"
 Said,


"Well,
 I,
 you
 know,
 I
 know
 the
 product's


not
 good
 enough
 yet."
 Going
 back
 to


perfectionism,
 uh,
 and
 I
 I
 just
 think


it'll
 be
 spread
 faster
 if
 it's
 free.
 and


they
 said,
 "Well,
 uh,
 if
 it's
 free,
 you


could
 go
 out
 of
 business,
 and
 so
 we
 want


to
 make
 sure
 you
 don't
 we
 cannot
 rely
 on


software
 for
 critical
 operations
 is


gonna
 could
 go
 out
 of
 business,
 so


please
 charge
 money."
 And,
 uh,
 that
 was


the
 point
 where
 I'm
 like, "Oh,
 I
 think


we're
 really
 behind
 here."
 Came
 back
 to


the
 team,
 we
 got
 to
 charge.
 We
 got
 to


get
 pricing
 in
 order.
 And
 everyone's


like,
 "Uh,
 yes,
 duh.
 We've
 been
 telling


you
 this."
 So,
 you
 know,
 sometimes
 a


little
 slow.


>> How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 product


innovation
 and
 and
 launches?
 I
 mean,
 now


you're
 launching
 loads
 of
 products,


right?
 Yeah.


>> How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 which
 problems
 to


solve?


>> So
 the
 interesting
 thing
 about
 Figma
 is


the
 Figma
 design
 tool
 at
 the
 core
 of
 it


all.
 Uh
 made
 for
 designers,
 made
 for


people
 creating
 digital
 software.
 And


despite
 that,
 we
 see
 people
 doing
 so


much
 more
 with
 it.
 We
 see
 people


creating
 complex
 illustrations.
 We
 see


people,
 you
 know,
 using
 it
 for


whiteboarding,
 diagramming,


brainstorming
 slides,
 uh,
 using
 it
 for


production
 graphics,
 making
 websites,


making
 really
 complex
 prototypes
 and


more.
 And
 each
 time
 we
 start
 to
 see
 and


notice
 and
 watch
 these
 use
 cases
 grow


inside
 of
 Figma,


we
 try
 to
 pull
 them
 out
 into
 their
 own


product
 surfaces.
 The
 reason
 we
 do
 that


is
 because
 otherwise
 if
 you're


optimizing
 for
 a
 use
 case
 like
 slides


for example
 and
 you
 make
 it
 so
 that
 you


really
 build
 around
 it.
 Okay,
 well
 now


Figma
 design
 needs
 presenter
 notes
 and


it
 needs
 all
 this
 other
 slides


functionality
 or
 if
 you're
 trying
 to
 do


diagramming
 and
 whiteboarding
 there's
 a


bunch
 of
 features
 you're
 going
 to
 need


to
 pack
 in
 there
 and
 that
 makes
 the


digital
 design
 product
 Figma
 design
 more


complex.
 It
 makes
 it
 less
 approachable.


But
 if
 you
 pull
 it
 out
 into
 its
 own


space,
 then
 you
 can
 actually
 help
 it


find
 its
 own
 life
 and
 its
 own
 point
 of


view.
 So
 for
 example,
 Fig
 Jam
 is
 a


product
 that
 we
 really
 lean
 into
 fun
 on.


Fig
 Jam
 is
 a
 product
 that
 uh
 we
 explored


all
 these
 ideas
 that
 we
 wanted
 to
 create


to
 bring
 joy
 to
 folks.
 things
 like
 uh


emoji
 reactions,
 cursor
 chat,
 stamps,


stickers,
 uh
 as
 well
 as,
 you
 know,
 how


can
 I
 set
 a
 timer
 during
 a
 brainstorm


and
 have
 some
 music
 play,
 you
 know,
 all


these
 little
 details
 that
 if
 we
 had


started
 in
 Figma
 design
 for
 those,


people
 would have
 said,
 you're
 getting


in
 my
 way,
 stop.


But
 instead
 in
 Fig
 Jam,
 you
 can
 wave


your
 cursor
 around
 and
 it
 gives
 you
 a


high
 five
 if
 you
 intersect
 with
 someone


else,


>> you
 know,
 and
 and
 it's
 just
 uh
 some
 of


those
 things
 we
 later
 bring
 into
 Figma


design,
 but
 having
 its
 own
 space
 to


develop
 and
 to
 grow
 and
 find
 its
 own


voice,
 that
 was
 really
 critical
 for
 Fig


Jam.
 It's
 critical
 for
 many
 of
 the


product.


>> Tell
 me
 how
 you're
 building
 kind
 of
 fun


into
 the
 products.


>> Yeah.
 Well,


>> because
 that's
 been
 a
 deliberate


strategy,
 right?
 For
 Fig
 Jam,
 it's


definitely
 been
 I
 don't
 think
 all
 of
 the


products
 uh
 need
 to
 differentiate


through
 fun,
 but
 for
 Fig
 Jam,
 that
 was


our
 point
 of
 view
 and
 continues
 to
 be.


And
 it
 really
 started
 with
 a
 one-day


design
 sprint.
 Uh
 it's
 kind
 of
 wild
 that


it
 was
 one
 day,
 but
 yeah,
 we're
 in


COVID,
 everyone
 was
 remote.
 And
 it
 just


felt
 like
 in
 order
 to
 get
 people
 to
 open


up
 and
 to
 brainstorm,
 how
 do
 you
 do


that?
 Well,
 fun,
 safety,
 psychological


safety,
 that's
 important.


>> And
 so,
 we
 really
 tried
 to
 lean
 into


that
 aspect
 of
 it.
 And
 it
 was
 amazing.
 I


mean,
 I
 think
 in
 one
 day
 we
 had
 a
 small


team
 of
 designers
 generate
 20
 30
 ideas,


maybe
 five
 of
 them
 shipped.
 Uh
 several


of
 them
 ended
 up,
 you
 know,
 being


patented.
 Uh
 and
 all
 out
 of
 one
 day
 of


brainstorming.


>> Just
 what
 I
 think
 it's
 sometimes
 it's


like
 if
 you
 can
 give
 clear
 direction
 and


directive
 to
 a
 team,
 they
 can
 just
 do


the
 most
 amazing
 things
 if
 you
 get
 out


of
 their
 way.


>> And
 now
 you
 do
 dog
 fooding,
 right?
 You


use
 your
 own
 tools
 to


>> always
 have.


>> Yeah.
 use
 your
 own
 tools
 to
 create
 new


products


>> always.


>> How
 does
 that
 accelerate
 innovation?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 it
 doesn't
 until
 you
 get
 to


the
 point
 where
 the
 product's
 good.


>> But,
 uh,
 I'll
 give
 an
 example
 from
 the


earliest
 days
 of
 Figma.
 I'll
 give
 you
 an


example
 now.
 So,
 in
 the
 early
 days
 of


Figma,
 uh,
 we
 dog
 fooded
 Figma
 design.


And
 the
 only
 thing
 we
 did
 design
 with


after
 we
 got
 to
 a
 certain
 point,
 which


was
 quite
 early,
 was
 Figma
 design.
 And


there
 were
 days
 where
 we
 broke
 the
 build


and
 our
 poor
 designer
 said,
 "Okay,
 I'm


going
 to
 go
 home
 early
 because
 y'all


don't
 have
 a
 fix."
 And
 so,
 uh,
 that
 was


rough
 and
 it
 very
 quickly
 became
 a


culture
 of,
 "Okay,
 we
 have
 to
 have


quality.
 We
 can't
 just
 have
 the
 app


crash.
 We
 can't
 make
 our
 designer
 so


angry,
 uh,
 when
 we,
 you
 know,
 mess


things
 up."
 And
 so,
 that
 really


instilled
 right
 away
 a
 loop
 with
 the


customer.
 The
 customer
 just
 happened
 to


be
 on
 our
 team.
 moving
 forward
 today.
 I


mean,
 Figma
 make
 for
 example
 or
 our
 dev


modem
 MCP.


>> Uh
 these
 are
 tools
 that
 really
 help
 us


accelerate
 uh
 our
 work
 and
 our


prototyping,
 our
 exploration
 of
 what
 we


can
 do


>> and
 that's
 not
 even
 to
 mention
 some
 of


the
 stuff
 that
 we've
 got
 in
 the


pipeline.


>> Now
 you
 mentioned
 that
 some
 of
 these
 was


during
 COVID
 and
 so
 how
 did
 in
 a
 way
 how


did
 co
 help
 you
 uh
 in
 designing
 products


>> because
 you
 were
 situated
 in
 all


different
 types
 of
 places
 and
 in
 a
 way


the
 whole
 concept
 is
 to
 tie
 people


together,
 right?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 interesting.
 you
 know,
 we


were
 fully
 in
 person
 before
 COVID.
 I


mean,
 I
 think
 there's
 one
 or
 two
 people


that
 needed
 to
 go
 somewhere
 else
 in
 the


team
 and
 they
 had
 had
 such
 context
 that


we
 said,
 "Okay,
 fine."
 But,
 I
 mean,
 it


was
 this
 very
 small
 part
 of
 the


population.


>> And
 then
 overnight,
 like
 everybody
 else,


we
 found
 ourselves
 a
 remote
 team.
 We
 had


heard
 for
 ages
 that
 Figma
 was
 great
 for


remote
 work,
 but
 we
 never
 experienced


it.
 And
 then
 suddenly
 we
 found
 out,
 oh


yeah,
 it
 is.
 uh
 but
 yeah
 I
 don't
 think


that
 from
 a
 business
 standpoint
 co


either
 decelerated
 or
 accelerated
 us


instead
 it
 was
 I
 think
 a
 we
 were
 already


on
 a
 very
 strong
 trajectory
 at
 that


point
 and
 uh
 that
 trajectory
 continued


but
 certainly
 there
 were
 many
 other


challenges
 uh
 that
 everyone
 else
 faced


too
 but
 how
 do
 you
 create
 culture


especially
 for
 new
 folks
 during
 co
 when


we
 started
 uh
 I
 would
 do
 these


breakfasts
 for
 new
 hires


>> where
 we'd
 all
 have
 breakfast
 for
 an


hour
 and
 we
 would
 just
 talk
 about


different
 questions
 that
 were
 on


people's
 minds.
 But
 then
 we
 started


growing
 faster
 and
 suddenly
 I
 realized


that
 if
 I
 were
 to
 uh
 do
 all
 the


breakfast
 I
 needed
 to
 do
 with
 a
 group


size
 I
 thought
 was
 right,
 I
 would
 be


doing
 breakfast
 5
 days
 a
 week
 for
 the


next,
 you
 know,
 whatever
 amount
 of
 time.


>> And
 that's
 when
 unfortunately
 I
 had
 to


stop
 that
 one.


>> Uh
 so
 not
 everything
 survived
 scale,
 but


that's
 not
 the
 reason
 to
 not
 do
 things.


You
 should
 still
 do
 things
 even
 if


they're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 the
 long-term


solution.


>> So
 uh
 we
 did
 lots
 of
 fun
 things


together.
 For
 example,
 we
 made
 a
 musical


during
 co
 remotely.
 Uh
 we
 have
 a
 thing


called
 maker
 week
 at
 Figma
 where
 the


entire
 company
 gets
 a
 week
 to
 make


anything
 that
 can
 be
 beneficial
 to
 the


company
 and
 this
 includes
 not
 just


engineers,
 product
 designers,
 uh
 you


know
 people
 in
 the
 you
 know
 sort
 of
 R&D


function
 it's
 anyone
 that
 wants
 to


participate
 and
 uh
 yeah
 we
 had
 a
 new


hire
 who
 had
 come
 from
 a
 background
 of


not
 just
 impeccable
 engineering
 but
 also


uh
 you
 know
 being
 able
 to
 create
 musical


scores
 and
 making
 musicals.


That's
 one
 of
 their
 passions.
 And
 uh
 we


also
 happen
 to
 have
 a
 Broadway
 star
 on


the
 team.


>> Well,
 you
 were
 acting
 too
 when
 you
 were


young.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 But
 I
 wasn't
 a
 Broadway
 star.


We
 had
 a
 legitimately
 like
 amazing


Broadway
 star
 who
 had
 the
 most
 amazing


voice.
 Uh
 no,
 not
 not
 comparable.
 Um
 and


uh
 and
 also
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 people
 that


were
 just
 very
 excited
 about
 expressing


and
 having
 fun
 together.
 And
 so
 that
 was


what
 they
 did.


>> And
 it's
 online.
 Uh
 you
 can
 decide


whether
 it's
 awesome
 or
 cringe.
 Uh
 I


think
 it's
 awesome
 for
 what
 it's
 worth.


>> Yeah.
 Cool.
 And
 then
 out
 comes
 Adobe
 and


offers
 you
 $20
 billion
 for
 the
 company.


>> That's
 true.


>> I
 mean
 that's
 quite
 amazing.
 But
 then


that
 it
 fell
 through.
 So
 how
 did
 it
 do


to
 what
 did
 that
 do
 to
 the
 organization?


You
 think
 there's
 a
 big
 check
 coming
 and


then
 it
 ain't
 coming.


>> Uh
 yeah
 I
 mean


>> how
 much
 did
 you
 own
 with
 the
 company
 by


then?


>> Uh
 I
 forget
 the
 exact
 ownership
 at
 that


time.
 It's
 probably
 uh
 10ish%
 or
 so.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 that
 uh
 first
 of
 all,
 I


mean
 it
 wasn't
 the
 first
 time
 they
 had


come.
 It's
 all
 publicly
 disclosed.
 They


are
 an
 amazing
 company
 and
 I
 think


almost
 everyone
 at
 Figma
 has
 not
 just


respect
 for
 them
 but
 also
 grew
 up
 using


their
 tools.


>> So
 yeah,
 we've
 we're
 big
 fans,


>> but
 um


>> yeah,
 they
 at
 the
 start
 of
 Figma,
 we


really
 thought
 about
 them
 as
 a


competitor.
 Uh
 we
 thought
 we
 were
 going


to
 go
 be
 the
 creative
 tools
 company
 and


design.
 It
 was
 such
 a
 small
 market
 for


software
 design
 according
 to
 all
 the


data
 we
 saw.
 I
 mean
 the
 Bureau
 of
 Labor


Stics
 said
 there
 was
 250,000
 designers


in
 the
 United
 States


and
 based
 on
 that
 we
 thought
 okay
 this


will
 be
 a
 start
 and
 then
 we'll
 expand


out
 just
 so
 happened
 that
 market
 grew
 in


a
 huge
 way


>> that
 we
 had
 intuition
 it
 would
 grow
 like


we
 talked
 about
 with
 the
 exponential


rise
 of
 software
 and
 the
 value
 of
 design


moving
 up
 the
 stack
 and
 uh
 the
 design


being
 a
 differentiator
 but


>> I
 don't
 think
 we
 truly
 appreciate
 how


much
 and
 how
 fast
 it
 could
 grow
 and
 so


we
 suddenly
 found
 ourselves
 elves
 in
 a


world
 where
 we're
 really
 building
 out
 a


platform
 for
 product
 design
 and


development.
 Again,
 fit
 into
 our


framework,
 eliminate
 the
 gap
 between


imagination,
 reality.
 Well,
 part
 of
 that


is
 making
 it
 so
 you
 can
 go
 from
 idea
 to


a
 shipped
 digital
 product.
 But
 it
 wasn't


competitive
 anymore
 with
 Adobe.
 There's


a
 period
 of
 time
 where
 they
 tried,


didn't
 work.
 They
 deprecated
 it
 uh
 and


put
 on
 maintenance
 mode.
 So,
 to
 me,
 it


was
 like,
 okay,
 we're
 big
 enough
 now


where
 we
 could
 be
 absorbed.
 uh
 this
 is
 a


very
 like
 wellthoughtout
 valuation


and
 I
 think
 that
 the
 pitch
 uh
 I
 thought


it
 was
 good
 about
 what
 we
 could
 do
 in


the
 cont
 context
 of
 Adobe
 and
 also


frankly
 you
 know
 I
 was
 looking
 around


the
 corner
 at
 AI
 it
 was
 before
 chatbt


but
 you
 could
 see
 that
 trend
 and
 where


it
 might
 go
 and
 I
 uh
 I
 didn't
 know
 if
 it


would
 onetenth
 or
 10x
 our
 business
 or


100th
 or
 100x
 our
 business
 I
 mean
 I
 I


really
 couldn't
 tell.
 It
 was
 just
 so


chaotic.
 And
 so
 I
 thought,
 okay,


strengthen
 the
 numbers.
 And
 uh
 for
 all


the
 reasons
 I
 mentioned
 and
 then
 some,


let's
 do
 it.
 And
 uh
 yeah,
 the
 definitely


thought
 that
 it
 would
 go
 through.
 It
 did


not.
 Uh
 the
 team
 really
 I'm
 so
 proud
 of


how
 they
 worked
 through
 that
 with
 with


me.
 And
 you
 know
 it
 was
 a
 moment
 where


we
 needed
 to
 continue
 accelerating


whether
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 at
 Adobe
 or


we're
 going
 to
 be
 independent.
 We
 had
 to


keep
 our
 foot
 on
 the
 gas.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 the
 team
 did
 that.
 The
 team
 operated


excellently
 and
 coming
 out
 of
 it
 we
 were


able
 to
 launch
 dev
 mode.
 Uh
 and
 then
 the


next
 year
 four
 additional
 products
 and
 I


think
 our
 pace
 of
 innovation
 our


momentum
 has
 only
 increased
 from
 there.


>> And
 then
 you
 IPOed
 instead.


>> That's
 correct.


>> Are
 you
 happy
 that
 you
 IPL?


>> Yeah.


Odd,
 odd
 question.
 Um,


>> no,
 because
 it's
 not
 odd
 because
 a
 lot


of
 companies
 these
 days
 choose
 to
 be


private.


>> Well,
 look,
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 that
 there


are
 some
 companies
 in
 the
 world
 like


SpaceX
 where
 they
 have
 every
 right
 to
 be


private
 as
 long
 as
 they
 want
 to.


>> AI,
 Dropics,
 I
 mean,
 lots
 of
 them.


>> Uh,
 I
 think
 Stripe
 and
 SpaceX
 are
 maybe


a
 class
 of
 their
 own
 there.
 M


>> and
 uh
 SpaceX
 in
 particular,
 yeah,
 they


have
 no
 reason
 why
 they
 need
 to
 go


public
 or
 uh
 if
 they
 want
 to
 stay


private,
 they
 should
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that.


>> Um
 not
 every
 company
 is
 a
 SpaceX
 and
 I


think
 that
 we
 are
 an
 incredible
 company,


but
 we're
 one
 that
 will
 eventually
 go


public


>> and
 the
 question
 is
 if
 you're
 going
 to


go
 public
 one
 day,
 why
 not
 now?


>> We
 were
 ready.
 Uh
 and
 I'm
 glad
 we
 did


it.


It
 forces
 a
 level
 of
 discipline
 of


course
 but
 that's
 a
 discipline
 that
 I


think
 we
 should
 have
 had
 anyway.


>> Now
 you
 are
 using
 your
 talent
 and
 your


thinking
 um
 and
 your
 visions
 to
 invest


in
 other
 in
 other
 uh
 kind
 of
 startups


like
 drones,
 crypto
 uh
 and
 so
 on.
 What


are
 the
 kind
 of
 things
 that
 you
 are
 um


that
 you
 think
 is
 interesting?


>> It's
 more
 a
 question
 of
 I
 don't
 find


interesting.
 I
 can't
 think
 of
 anything.


uh
 the
 um
 yeah
 I'm
 pretty
 curious
 about


the
 world
 in
 general
 and
 uh


>> uh
 whether
 it
 be
 anything
 from
 you
 know


certain
 uh
 parts
 of
 the
 software
 market


to
 uh
 hardware
 to
 uh
 the
 life
 sciences.


Um


>> but
 I
 mean
 you
 can't
 invest
 in


everything.
 So
 where
 do
 you
 choose
 to


invest?


>> Well
 look
 my
 time
 is
 very
 limited.
 So
 my


focus
 is
 on
 Figma
 and
 I
 spend
 sort
 of
 uh


I
 don't
 know
 basically
 all
 my
 waking


hours
 on
 Figma.
 And
 so
 then


>> something
 that
 I
 invest
 in
 has
 to
 be
 so


exciting
 or
 be
 so
 helpful
 for
 the
 world


>> and
 economically
 viable
 that
 because
 I


think
 those
 two
 go
 together.
 If
 you
 are


economically
 viable
 and
 helpful
 then
 you


can
 be
 more
 helpful.
 and
 scales
 uh
 that


it
 has
 to
 keep
 me
 up
 at
 night
 uh
 because


I'm
 literally
 going
 to
 trade
 off
 sleep


in
 order
 to
 go
 evaluate
 and
 dive
 into
 an


investment.


>> Uh
 and
 if
 that
 is
 true,
 then
 my


curiosity
 is
 so
 peaked,
 then
 yeah,
 I'll


dive
 in
 and
 spend
 time
 and
 understand


the
 company
 and
 then
 I
 have
 the


additional
 test
 of
 do
 I
 want
 to
 keep


spending
 that
 time?


>> And
 if
 it's
 so
 exciting
 to
 work
 with


that
 founder
 because
 they're
 so


incredible,


>> that's
 when
 I
 make
 an
 investment.


Let's
 um
 talk
 a
 bit
 about
 culture.
 So,


how
 do
 you
 think
 your
 leadership
 style


has
 changed
 from
 when
 you
 started
 until


now?


>> I'm
 not
 sure
 my
 leadership
 style
 has


changed
 so
 much.
 I
 think
 the
 way
 that
 I


lead
 has
 certainly
 evolved.
 Uh
 I
 think


that
 the
 same
 lessons
 I'm
 learning
 now


are
 the
 same
 lessons
 I've
 learned
 in
 the


past.


>> Uh
 for
 example,
 I'm
 always
 learning
 that


I
 need
 to
 unpack
 my
 context
 and
 give


more
 of
 my
 thinking
 and
 articulate
 more


of
 my
 thinking


>> to
 explain
 why.
 Yeah,
 it's
 like
 the
 um


you
 know,
 you're
 doing
 math
 homework
 and


you
 show
 the
 answer.
 Well,
 the
 teacher


wants
 you
 to
 show
 your
 work.
 And
 uh


>> why
 is
 that
 important?
 Why
 is
 that


important?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 important
 that


people
 in
 the
 company
 have
 frameworks


and
 they
 understand
 your
 reasoning
 for


things


>> because
 if
 they
 don't,
 then
 they
 cannot


replicate
 your
 point
 of
 view
 when
 you're


out
 of
 the
 room.


>> And
 if
 you
 don't
 elevate
 it
 to
 that


level,
 they
 also
 cannot
 debate
 it


properly.


>> Takes
 more
 time.


>> Yes.
 But
 also
 you
 get
 to
 better


thinking.


>> Uh
 even
 writing
 down
 something
 helps
 you


think
 through
 it.
 And
 whether
 it's


writing
 it
 down
 or
 it's
 a
 in-depth


debate
 that
 then
 gets
 memorialized


somewhere,
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 helpful


in
 terms
 of
 scaling
 your
 thinking
 and


your
 thought
 processes
 to
 the
 team.
 So


that's
 something
 I've
 continued
 to


learn.


>> Uh
 I
 think
 I've
 also
 continued
 to
 learn


uh
 that
 it's
 so
 important
 to
 empower
 and


you
 hire
 these
 incredible
 people.
 Well,


you
 both
 want
 to
 put
 them
 on
 the
 right


path
 and
 make
 sure
 they
 have
 the
 right


constraints
 going
 back
 to
 the
 previous


topic,
 but
 also
 it's
 super
 important


that
 you
 get
 out
 of
 their
 way.


>> Well,
 it's
 it's
 but
 it's
 difficult
 for


perfectionists
 to
 empower
 and
 get
 out
 of


the
 way,
 right?


>> That's
 attention,


>> right?
 And
 how
 do
 you
 do
 that?
 Well,
 I


try
 my
 best
 to
 give
 good
 feedback


uh
 and
 identify
 when
 something
 is
 truly


a
 one-way
 door
 decision
 where
 it's


irreversible
 or
 it
 will
 at least
 be
 very


costly.
 And
 then
 if
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a


decision
 that
 uh
 I
 think
 we
 will
 really


regret
 living
 with
 then
 I
 will
 push
 back


and
 I'll
 push
 back
 hard
 if
 needed.
 But


in
 general
 uh
 I
 more
 try
 to
 give
 good


feedback.


uh
 if
 I
 think
 that
 it's
 not
 being
 heard


or
 actioned
 on
 that's
 different.


>> Uh
 you
 know
 uh
 if
 we
 all
 agree
 on


something
 and
 we
 don't
 do
 it
 you
 know


and
 we're
 not
 improving
 the
 quality
 of


something
 then
 that's
 a
 different


problem
 on
 process.


>> So
 when
 you
 say
 oneway
 door
 that's
 a


decision
 that's
 been
 made
 and
 which
 you


can't
 reverse.


>> Uh
 it's
 a
 decision
 that
 maybe
 is
 not


made.
 Maybe
 it's
 maybe
 it's
 made
 it


doesn't
 matter
 about
 the
 state
 of
 the


decision
 but
 rather
 the
 potential
 for
 it


is
 that
 it
 irrevocably
 changes
 the


organization
 or
 business
 in
 such
 a
 way


or
 product
 that
 you
 cannot
 uh
 go
 back


easily
 from
 it.


>> You
 can't
 un
 ship
 it
 without
 you
 know
 a


lot
 of
 time
 effort
 or
 cost.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 there
 are other
 decisions


which
 it
 doesn't
 really
 matter
 because


you
 can
 overest
 them.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 plenty
 of
 things


you
 can
 AB
 test,
 see
 if
 they
 work
 or


not.
 And
 those
 are
 things
 that
 um,
 you


know,
 you
 shouldn't
 waste
 your
 time
 on.


And
 so,
 then
 it's
 about,
 okay,
 well,
 do


I
 have
 folks
 on
 the
 team
 who
 are


exercising
 and
 showing
 great
 judgment?


And
 if
 you've
 got
 great
 judgment,
 then


most
 time
 your
 batting
 average
 is
 pretty


high.
 Everyone
 makes
 mistakes.
 Uh,
 if


you're
 not
 making
 any
 mistakes,
 you're


probably
 not
 being
 creative
 or
 exploring


enough.
 So,
 I
 think
 that
 it's
 good
 to


let
 people
 make
 mistakes
 and
 learn.
 Uh


but
 if
 you're
 making
 like
 all
 mistakes,


that's
 also
 bad,


>> of
 course.
 What
 are
 what
 are
 the


non-negotiable
 cultural
 elements
 that


you
 have
 kept
 as
 you've
 scaled
 from
 the


two
 of
 you
 to
 1,800
 people?


>> I
 I
 think
 that
 um
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 we're
 very


lucky
 because


by
 virtue
 of
 being
 Figma,
 we
 kind
 of
 put


this
 bat
 signal
 in
 the
 sky
 of
 what
 we


stand
 for.
 uh
 creative
 expression,


craft,


uh
 first
 principles
 thinking,
 systems


orientation,
 and
 the
 people
 that


resonate
 with
 that,
 they
 are
 attracted


to
 Figma.
 And
 so
 our
 population
 that


comes
 to
 us
 looking
 for
 a
 role,
 uh
 they


really
 do
 share
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 traits.


But
 another
 one
 that
 I
 would
 call
 out
 is


humility.
 Another
 one
 that
 is
 even


harder
 uh
 in
 terms
 of
 screening


sometimes
 is
 self-awareness.
 Because
 if


you're
 not
 self-aware
 and
 I
 give
 you


feedback,
 uh
 it's
 not
 clear
 that
 you'll


take
 it.


>> And
 so
 that
 makes
 sort
 of
 feedback


conversations
 where
 you
 need
 someone
 to,


you
 know,
 change
 course
 a
 little
 bit


very
 difficult.
 And
 I
 think
 if
 you
 are


able
 to
 build
 a
 team
 of
 humble,


self-aware
 people
 who
 care
 about
 craft,


who
 have
 a
 growth
 mindset,
 who
 care


about
 community,
 uh
 that
 is
 an


incredible
 team.
 One
 word
 that
 come
 up


again
 and
 again
 when
 people
 talk
 about


you
 is
 that
 you
 are
 kind


>> a
 kind
 leader.


>> I
 try
 to
 be
 uh
 why
 is
 it
 why
 okay
 my


best
 stupid
 question.
 Why
 why
 is
 it


important
 to
 be
 a
 kind
 leader?


>> Look
 I
 mean
 I'm
 I'm
 Jewish
 but
 the
 sort


of
 golden
 rule
 uh
 I
 think
 is
 a
 very
 good


one.
 Treat
 others
 the
 way
 you
 want
 to
 be


treated.
 Uh
 so
 that's
 just
 like
 a
 moral


thing.
 The
 energy
 you
 put
 out
 into
 the


world
 is
 the
 energy
 you'll
 receive
 back.


uh
 whether
 that
 be
 because
 of
 your


perception,
 your
 uh
 way
 that
 you
 frame


the
 world
 and
 sort
 of
 your
 viewport
 into


the
 motivations
 of
 others,


>> but
 people
 match
 you.
 And
 if
 you
 want
 to


create
 an
 environment
 that
 fosters


creativity,
 then
 yes,
 I
 think
 you
 really


need
 to
 create
 an
 environment
 that's


supportive.


>> And
 kindness
 is
 a
 big
 part
 of
 that.
 But


it's
 also,
 I'll
 be
 clear,
 that
 kindness


is
 not
 always
 saying
 the
 thing
 that


feels
 nice
 or
 non-confrontational.


Um,
 if
 I
 believe
 that
 uh
 you
 have


something
 that
 you
 need
 to
 know,
 even
 if


it's
 hard
 feedback,
 uh
 it's
 my
 duty
 to


tell
 you.


>> And
 if
 I
 don't,
 that's
 not
 kind
 because


it's
 going
 to
 come
 up
 later
 and
 it's


going
 to
 create
 an
 issue
 for
 you,
 for


me,
 for
 both
 of
 us,
 and
 that
 could


actually
 escalate.


>> So,
 the
 kindest
 thing
 is
 to
 be
 extremely


direct
 in
 my
 opinion
 and
 upfront
 make


sure
 that
 people
 are
 communicating.
 And


that's
 something
 I'm
 always
 pushing
 on


is
 how
 to
 get
 people
 to
 be
 more
 direct


with
 each
 other.


>> I
 think
 it's
 quite
 interesting
 because


when
 you're
 young,
 kind
 is
 the
 opposite


of
 cool.


>> Oh,
 it
 is.


>> Well,
 kind
 of
 isn't.
 I
 mean,
 if
 you're


in


>> I
 was
 never
 I
 don't
 know,
 but


>> So,
 I
 mean,
 I
 was
 never
 cool
 either,
 but


I
 mean,
 it's
 like
 the
 cool
 guys,
 they


were
 not
 very
 kind,
 but
 when
 you
 get


older,
 kind
 is
 the
 only
 thing
 that


matters.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 mean,
 look,
 like
 I
 think
 that


there's
 uh
 all
 sorts
 of
 ways
 I
 can
 be


more
 kind.
 And
 I
 certainly
 get
 intense


sometimes.
 Uh,
 anyone
 on
 my
 team
 would


probably
 tell
 you
 that,
 but
 that's


always
 my
 goal
 is
 to
 deliver,
 you
 know,


conversation,
 feedback,


uh,
 and
 content
 with
 kindness
 and,
 um,


to
 treat
 other
 with
 others
 with
 empathy


>> and
 to
 understand
 where
 they're
 coming


from.
 Because
 also
 if
 you
 don't
 actually


have
 empathy
 for
 someone
 else
 and
 what


they're
 what's
 happening
 in
 their
 life,


then
 how
 can
 you
 effectively
 connect


with
 them
 and
 actually
 understand
 where


they're
 coming
 from
 and
 learn
 from
 them?


Uh
 and
 I
 think
 that
 you
 can
 learn
 from


everyone.
 So


>> you
 mentioned
 curiosity
 um
 a
 bit


earlier.
 Um
 I
 think
 your
 father
 said


somewhere
 that
 you
 are
 you
 were
 curious


about
 everything.


>> That
 sounds
 right.
 Uh
 I
 I
 uh


>> I
 think
 he
 even
 said
 that
 you
 were
 a
 bit


weird
 when
 you
 were
 a
 child.
 Oh
 yeah,


that
 that's
 definitely
 something
 he


said.
 Uh
 I
 was
 a
 weird
 kid.


>> But
 weird
 is
 good.
 No,


>> I
 think
 so.


It
 was
 interesting
 actually.
 My
 dad
 uh


he's
 passed
 and
 and
 I
 miss
 him
 dearly.


But
 uh
 yeah,
 when
 I
 got
 the
 Teal


Fellowship,
 his
 comment
 was,
 uh
 this
 is


pretty
 cool.
 I
 thought
 this
 this
 whole


thing
 was
 very
 uh
 very
 off,
 but
 now
 that


I've
 actually
 seen
 all
 the
 finalists
 in


one
 place,
 I
 I
 I
 get
 it.
 They're
 just
 as


weird
 as
 you
 are.


>> I'm
 like,
 "Thanks.
 Thanks,
 Dad."
 So,


>> is
 he
 the
 one
 you
 wanna
 kind
 of
 show?
 Is


he
 the
 one
 you
 want
 to
 impress?


>> Uh,
 you
 know,
 my
 dad
 was
 so
 loving
 and


let
 me
 know
 so
 often
 as
 a
 kid,
 as
 a


teen,
 when
 I
 had
 no
 reason
 for
 him
 to


say
 this
 and
 as
 an
 adult
 that
 uh
 that
 he


was
 proud.
 So
 I
 feel
 uh
 yeah
 I
 feel
 very


very
 loved
 always
 have
 by
 him.
 Uh
 I'm


very
 lucky
 to
 have
 a
 great
 family


>> and
 uh
 very
 supportive
 family.


>> Yeah.
 No


>> try
 to
 do
 the
 same
 in
 my
 life
 for
 the


people
 I
 love
 as
 well.


>> Oh
 that's
 that's
 great.
 You
 were
 a
 child


actor
 as
 we
 talked
 about.
 Uh
 do
 you


think
 it's
 been
 important?
 You
 know,
 the


the
 thing
 that
 I
 think
 I've
 drawn
 the


most
 from
 the
 acting
 as
 a
 kid,
 and
 by


the
 way,
 I
 acted
 until
 I
 was
 a
 teen,
 and


then
 I
 got
 super
 awkward.
 So,
 that's


where
 I
 capped
 out
 real
 fast.
 Uh,
 but


you
 know,
 as
 an
 actor,


uh,
 you
 go
 out
 for
 all
 these
 roles
 and
 I


was
 doing
 theater,
 I
 was
 doing
 uh,
 you


know,
 commercial
 work,


>> uh,
 I
 was auditioning
 for
 movies.
 It's


kind
 of
 the
 whole
 gamut.
 And
 I
 was


singing,
 too.
 Terrible
 dancer
 there
 at


the
 time.
 Uh,
 so
 only
 had
 two
 of
 the


three,
 but
 you
 go
 out
 for
 all
 these


roles
 and
 you're
 constantly
 rejected.


>> And
 that
 was
 just
 normal.
 Like
 it
 didn't


get
 to
 me
 at
 all.
 It
 was
 never
 like
 a
 me


thing.
 It
 was
 a


>> Do
 you
 think
 that's
 you
 get
 your
 stamina


from?


>> Maybe.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 it
 helps.
 I
 mean,
 I


just


>> don't
 really
 have
 a
 fear
 of
 going
 up
 in


front
 of
 people.
 I
 don't
 really
 have
 a


fear
 of
 getting
 rejected.


>> And
 so
 I
 I
 do
 have a
 fear
 of
 not
 trying.


>> Uh,
 to
 me,
 that's
 more
 the
 framework.
 M


>> like
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 look
 back
 and


regret
 not
 trying
 something.


>> So
 I
 think
 that
 maybe
 my
 brain
 is
 just
 a


little
 bit
 different
 from
 others
 that


way.


>> What
 do
 you
 read?


>> Uh
 right
 now
 a
 lot
 of
 machine
 learning


papers
 uh
 in
 the
 past
 uh
 literature,


non-fiction,
 uh
 design
 books,
 blogs
 that


I
 like
 but
 but
 right
 now
 papers.


>> What
 does
 your
 day
 what
 is
 your
 day
 look


like?


>> It
 is
 incredibly
 variable.
 Uh
 I
 wish
 it


>> when
 you
 wake
 up
 when
 do
 you
 wake
 up?


Uh,
 somewhere
 between
 4
 and
 8
 am,


>> right?
 I
 see.


>> So,
 just
 to
 show
 you
 the
 variability.


That's
 a


>> big
 range.


>> Yeah.
 Or
 I
 think
 I
 actually
 went
 to
 bed


at
 last
 night
 at
 4
 a.m.
 because
 uh
 I
 was


working
 on
 our
 ourh
 video
 for
 today's


Gemini
 release.
 Uh,
 so
 if
 I'm
 a
 little


tired,
 I'm
 sorry.


>> Well,
 that that
 does
 not
 come
 through
 at


all.


>> Trying
 to
 show
 you
 the
 variability
 is
 is


extreme.


>> How
 do
 you
 relax?


>> Uh,
 just
 talking
 to
 my
 wife
 is
 very


relaxing.
 We
 just
 got
 a
 sauna.
 Uh,
 all


right.
 That's
 good.
 That's
 good.
 So,


that
 has
 honestly
 been
 the
 That's
 great.


>> Well,
 I'm
 not
 mentioning
 because
 it's


Nordic.
 I'm
 mentioning
 it
 because
 it
 has


been
 the
 most
 life-changing
 thing
 or


purchase
 I've
 ever
 made
 in
 my
 life.
 And


it's


>> sas
 are
 wonderful.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 just
 like
 you
 sit
 there


and
 your
 entire
 body
 relaxes.
 You
 feel


so
 refreshed
 afterwards.
 So
 that
 uh
 and


then
 I
 think
 also
 you
 know
 it's
 weird


but
 um
 I
 find


uh


very
 odd
 prompting
 of
 LMS
 relaxing
 these


days.
 So
 I
 uh
 dive
 really
 deep
 into
 like


how
 do
 I
 get
 weird
 edge
 behavior


jailbreaks
 and
 whatnot
 for
 LMS
 and
 uh


that
 has
 been
 something
 that
 has
 relaxed


me.
 I
 haven't
 been
 into
 a
 TV
 show
 for
 a


long
 time
 though.


>> Last
 question.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 young


listeners.
 What
 is
 your
 advice
 to
 young


people?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 that
 uh
 if
 you're
 young


right
 now,
 you
 probably
 see
 a
 lot
 of


problems
 in
 the
 world,
 a
 lot
 of
 things


that
 could
 be
 improved.
 And
 I
 think
 that


it's
 really
 important
 to
 feel
 the
 agency


to
 take
 a
 design
 mindset
 to
 think
 from
 a


system
 standpoint,
 learn
 as
 much
 as
 you


can,
 be
 curious,
 identify
 your
 passion,


and
 then
 identify
 how
 that
 passion
 can


connect
 to
 actually
 helping
 improve
 the


world
 in
 some
 way.
 And
 I
 think
 that


requires
 optimism.


And
 uh
 optimism
 is
 a
 choice.
 You
 can


choose
 to
 be
 optimistic.
 You
 can
 also


choose
 not
 to
 be.
 But
 if
 you
 choose
 to


be
 optimistic,
 then
 you
 actually
 can
 go


and
 try
 and
 uh
 adjust
 or
 make
 a


difference
 uh
 for
 your
 society,
 for
 your


local
 community,
 for
 the
 global
 world.


And
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 you
 don't


have
 to
 be
 cynical
 or
 skeptical.
 The
 two


can
 coexist.
 because
 I
 think
 that
 uh


some
 folks
 that
 have
 a
 optimistic
 point


of
 view
 are
 also
 running
 a
 subprocess
 of


okay
 what
 are
 all
 the
 ways
 they
 can
 go


wrong
 so
 I
 can
 fix
 them


>> uh
 but
 you
 still
 have
 to
 have
 that


element
 of
 optimism
 and
 that's
 a
 choice


>> so
 choose
 optimism


>> that's
 a
 good
 plan
 well
 you
 for
 sure


have
 the
 combination
 of
 a
 growth
 mindset


and
 uh
 curiosity
 and
 passion
 it's
 been


tremendous
 uh
 speaking
 with
 you
 thank


you
 so
 much
 you
 thank
 you
 for
 having
