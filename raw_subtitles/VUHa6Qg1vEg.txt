After 8 years, "Your Name" is screened again in Taiwan
Today I am super crooked and want to go into the analysis of the movie "Your Name"
"Your Name" Storytelling
The story of the heroine Mitsuha and the hero Taki exchanging souls in a dream
at the beginning of the movie
We saw a set of comparisons
Mitsuha who lives in the countryside
Fed up with the backward life and family traditions in the countryside
More yearning for urban life in Tokyo
<font color=#FFF500FF>I’ve had enough of this town</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>I’ve had enough of this life</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>Let me be a handsome guy in Tokyo in the next life</font>
here
Mitsuba calls out young people in rural Japan
A cry for the pursuit of modern life
Japanese sociologist Akira Ohno used the concept of "bounded colony"
Alleged mass emigration of young people from rural Japan
As a result, more than half of the local population is over 65 years old.
These villages are filled with old people
Unable to maintain social functions
Gradually moving towards withering
Since the 1990s
The intention of rural Japan gradually turns into a business opportunity
Wear ancient Japanese kimonos to attract tourists
But it’s actually quite funny to the locals
Unexpectedly, I woke up the next day
Sanye's wish came true
Exchange souls with Taki in a dream
Start experiencing life in Tokyo
Railway tracks, high-rise buildings, fast food, coffee
These are things Sanye has never experienced before.
It’s like having a modern dream
But after the dream comes true
But it's the beginning of another nightmare
Sanye was forced to act as a wage earner
Highlighting the seemingly progressive life of Tokyo’s urbanites
But actually life is busy
Always working
Lack of close family ties like the small town of Itomori
In contrast
After the male protagonist enters the countryside from Tokyo
Instead, he quickly adapted to life in the countryside.
Learn ancestral weaving skills from Mitsuba’s family
And the myths and rituals of the Itomori area
in this process
Feel the feeling of rediscovering tradition
Echoing the views of folklorist Kunio Yanagida:
The spiritual homeland of the Japanese is in rural areas
All Shinto gods and monsters
They are all hiding in forests and mountains.
The shrine is the most typical symbol
In this way
This experiment of soul exchange
becomes a critique of modernity
Let modern people go back in time and experience rural life
people will know
To progress to modern times
What did we sacrifice?
To explain soul exchange
The hero and heroine begin to study how two people exchange souls.
The first theory proposed in the movie is quantum mechanics Hugh Everett's many-worlds interpretation
<font color=#FFF500FF>That is the memory of the past life</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>Or you may have accidentally connected to another universe according to Everett’s interpretation of multiple worlds</font>
The mainstream interpretation of quantum mechanics holds that
before observing
All possible events
are all in a quantum superposition state
Just like Schrödinger's cat
before opening the box
Both alive and dead
Until the superposition state collapses after observation
Only to determine what happened
There are no other possibilities.
But Everett thinks
All possible events are equally real
The universe will continue to divide itself
Develop several branched versions
If in universe A, Schrödinger’s cat would be dead
There must be another universe in which cats are still alive
The entire universe is a state of countless superpositions
Just in our world
There is no way to communicate with another world
But the invisible world still exists
Under this multi-world interpretation
Traditional Japan has not been replaced by modern Japan
Rather, it has always existed in a parallel universe
Tradition still has a chance to be saved
just like in the movie
The male and female protagonists are on two different timelines
The woman’s story line took place in 2013
After exchanging souls with the man
It became the timeline of 2016
etc.
If a multiverse is possible
How can different universe timelines interact?
here
Xin Haicheng further relied on the interpretation of dreams
Whenever we wake up from a dream
There is always a feeling that something is slowly disappearing
Can't remember the content of the dream
That thing that slowly disappears
Could it be a branch of a parallel universe?
Forgotten after we wake up
<font color=#FFF500FF>I only remember having a dream</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>But I can’t remember the content</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>But</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>There is always a feeling of losing something</font>
Physicist Roger Perenros’ theory of quantum consciousness suggests that
Human consciousness is not based on the neurochemical activity of the brain
Rather, it is the microtubule within the neuron.
Quantum systems with superpositions
When the superposition state collapses
Consciousness emerges
When a person is dreaming
The brain may be in a superposition state
Several branches of the universe, several versions of events
both exist in a superposition state
It's like a radio station signal
We can adjust the frequency to listen to a certain radio station
But other frequencies also exist
Sometimes we accidentally receive signals from other stations
It's like hearing the sound of another world
Precognitive dreams, sense of déjà vu
Maybe it's what happened in other universe timelines
Accidentally received by the dreamer
<font color=#FFF500FF>三叶</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>Are you dreaming now</font>
Taki in the movie
It's just that I accidentally connected to a signal of another frequency.
Back to the timeline of 2013
but after waking up
The memory slowly disappears
Trying to picture Itomori's appearance, looking for the place I saw in my dream
If Mitsuba came to Tokyo in pursuit of the dream of modernity
Taki is looking for Itomori in pursuit of the "dream of a traditional town"
But in the end I found out
It turned out that he had been dreaming
It's a place you can't go back to
<font color=#FFF500FF>But</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>The diary she wrote on my mobile phone is still...</font>
In this crucial scene
After Taki knew that Itomori had disappeared,
All traces of the past in the mobile phone also disappeared.
This traumatic knowledge changes memories of the past
<font color=#FFF500FF>disappeared</font>
Here we see what Freud called the “after-effects” (nachträglichkeit) of trauma.
Freud discovered
Trauma has the temporality of affecting the past from the future
Many children who have been domestically abused
When I was a kid, I didn’t actually know what that meant.
I didn’t know what violence was until I grew up.
But it was this moment of knowing
causing psychological trauma to the subject
Only after the subject has acquired knowledge of the event
Only then can the memory of past events be retroactively changed.
in other words
Cause of Trauma in the Future
It is the future that affects the past
And this is Taki’s final bet:
Go back to the past time
Change Itomori's fate
<font color=#FFF500FF>No, if time can really go back, please do it again</font>
Granny Ichiba once explained to Taki what "knot" is
<font color=#FFF500FF>Whether it is water, rice or wine</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>After entering the body, it will be connected with the soul, becoming a new "knot"</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>So going to the God of Pension today is an important ceremony to connect God and man</font>
The mouth chewing wine formed a knot with Sanye’s spirit body.
Became a bridge to Sanye's timeline
In this transitional ceremony back to the past
Taki saw the multiple evolutionary histories of "knot"
The orbit of a comet 1,200 years ago was a knot
Created a lake mouth in Itomori
Let the story of the town begin
The origin of life is also a knot
Everyone has a forgotten red line
It's the umbilical cord that connects me to my mother.
The culture inherited by the Sanye family is also about making knots.
Eventually the comet's orbit will return again
Like a knot tangled 1,200 years ago
Anthropologist Tim Ingold discovered
in many cultures around the world
People believe that the knot is a bridge between the living and the other world.
The Tahitian god ʻOro is usually entangled in knots
Will not interfere with the world of the living
Only during certain rituals will the knot be loosened, allowing the god to "appear"
Kandingei people in New Guinea
Important people are tied with a string of knots
Each big knot represents a place that has been moved in the past.
The summary represents the tribesmen who lived in that area.
during the annual rites of the dead
The tribesmen will use their fingers to go around each knot in order.
like the flow of time
Where the undead lived from the past
gradually move to another world
And in your name
We also see various metaphors of lines and the flow of time
As early as three years ago
When Mitsuha went to Tokyo to find Taki
The red thread weaves the timelines of the two together.
And every time the protagonists exchange souls
The camera will take a close-up of a line on the door
It's like entering another timeline
Finally on the train in Tokyo
The two tracks are like two passing timelines
in these moments of encounter
Mitsuha and Taki's timelines always don't match up
The first time was three years ago
Meeting too early in Tokyo made us miss each other
The second time was three years later
Taki called Mitsuba, it was too late to meet him
Sanye had already died in the disaster
Until the third time the two met in Itomori
The disconnected time was finally knitted together again
<font color=#FFF500FF>At Dusk</font>
The Japanese etymology of twilight means "demon time"
suggesting the transition between day and night
People have the opportunity to enter another world
In "Weathering with You"
The male protagonist travels through an abandoned torii gate
Entering the time and space of the Haruome Ritual, the heroine was found
And in "Journey to Suzuya"
The back door to the "eternal world"
It will take people into a time and space where there is no distinction between past, present and future.
These examples exemplify what mythologist Mircea Eliade calls "sacred time."
Mircea EliadeDiscovered
Many ancient cultures around the world had two views of time
Secular Temporality and Sacred Temporality
For example, the Australian Aboriginals believe
Every year there is a ritual time called "Dream Creation Era"
The Dream Era includes: origin, present, and future
Tribesmen will repeat the rituals that their ancestors have done at this time and place
By repeating rituals performed by people in the past at the same time and place
Australian Aboriginals believe
This helps them move from secular time to sacred time
It's like going back in time
Sharing the same time and space with the dead
Through transition rituals, humans return to a certain time and space and reunite with people from the past.
<font color=#FFF500FF>Sister, who are you? </font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>I am</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>Suzuya’s tomorrow</font>
this sacred temporality
Called "Eternal Return" by Eliade
The symptom of modern people is that they only live in secular time
Forgotten the sacred time of eternal return
But in Makoto Shinkai’s Disaster Trilogy
Quantum mechanics, the most cutting-edge scientific knowledge of mankind
Shintoism, Japan's oldest religion
resulting in synthesis
Let the protagonist transition from secular time to sacred time
by way of eternal return
Repeatedly return to the moment of disaster
etc.
What exactly is a disaster?
On the 6th anniversary of the 311 earthquake in Japan
Makoto Shinkai reveals the source of inspiration for "Your Name"
It was the 311 earthquake
Comet in "Your Name"
and the nuclear disaster caused by the 311 tsunami
This is a chance that only happens once in a thousand years.
Radiation contamination after nuclear disaster
Make the entire village of Fukushima uninhabitable
forced into desolation
Just like Itomori Village being concentrated by a comet in the movie
Forced to move villages en masse
After 311
After 311, Japanese philosopher Osamu Nishitani pointed out
Japan’s relationship with nuclear disasters itself is cyclical
From the two atomic bombs in World War II
Then to the Fifth Fukuryu Maru Incident in 1954
US hydrogen bomb test explodes, affecting Japanese fishing boats
almost
After World War II, the West could turn to atomic civilization
Gain knowledge about many atomic bombs
It was obtained at the expense of the Japanese.
At that time, Japan launched a large-scale anti-nuclear movement
It cannot resist the Japanese government’s efforts to develop nuclear energy in order to compete for the economy.
But the Trinity nuclear disaster revealed the problem of nuclear waste pollution
In this way
"Your Name" becomes a critique of modern progress
Urban areas prospered at the expense of their peripheries
Power for urban development masks devastating nuclear waste
until disaster occurs
Only then did this suppressed truth come to light.
But when it happened
The hero doesn't know about this at all
It was only three years later that I realized what I had lost.
Because modern development plans in the name of progress
As attractive as a beautiful comet
Even if one day an entire village is wiped out
Even urbanites won’t notice
Instead, you will admire that this is a beautiful night
<font color=#FFF500FF>I can witness this scene with my own eyes</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>For people of our time</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>I’m so lucky</font>
Progress is a spectacle to urbanites
It's a disaster on the fringes
The site of the final comet impact
It is the shrine of Itomori
This place is regarded by Yanagita Kunio as the spiritual homeland of the Japanese people.
will eventually be regarded as a backward region and destroyed.
Philosopher Jean-Luc Nancy believes that
in our time
There are no more natural disasters
There are only disasters of civilization
The 921 earthquake seemed like a natural disaster
But if humans hadn’t built buildings on earthquake zones,
How can earthquakes harm humans?
The 2004 South Asia earthquake devastated Thai resorts
But if it weren’t for the Thai government’s efforts to develop the tourism industry
Urban transformation of an area that was originally a coral reef
How could there be so many tourist casualties?
Many earthquakes occur in uninhabited areas
these earthquakes would not be considered disasters
in other words
The origin of disaster is not natural
It's the human world
The source of disaster that mankind has been trying to prevent
It's him
In this way
Makoto Shinkai's Disaster Trilogy
becomes an ethics of disaster
Modern people still need to work for economic development
How many man-made disasters have been created?
How many backward areas will be sacrificed?
What can we do to save those who have been sacrificed by progress?
Your name provides us with the first answer
Saving Itomori means saving the traditional Japan that was wiped out by modernization.
But when the protagonist goes back to the past
Warning of impending disaster
Everyone acted like it had nothing to do with them
The person who speaks the truth is treated as a lunatic
<font color=#FFF500FF>The comet broke apart and landed on the town? </font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>More than 5,000 people died? </font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>You should stop joking in moderation</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>If you really think so, I think you need to see a doctor</font>
Like today's climate scientists tell the truth about the climate crisis
Political leaders around the world still look irrelevant
Therefore we cannot expect others to save us
You must save yourself before disaster strikes
But in Weathering With You
But we see a different possibility
The protagonist is no longer thinking about how to save the entire village
Instead, he is willing to sacrifice the entire Tokyo to save the heroine
<font color=#FFF500FF>It doesn’t matter if it never clears up again</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>I want sunshine more than the blue sky</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>What the hell is the weather? Let it get out of control</font>
Today’s climate crisis is a legacy of the previous generation
Why young people are responsible for the previous generation
When the climate crisis makes survival increasingly difficult
Young people must let themselves survive first
Instead of thinking about how to save all mankind
Don't carry the burden of the world on your shoulders
Since disaster cannot be prevented from happening
It's better to live with disaster
This philosophy of living with disaster
Let it rain in Tokyo for 3 consecutive years
Just like Typhoon No. 19 in Japan in 2019
The whole of Tokyo is submerged in water
In the eyes of mankind, this is a disaster with heavy losses
But "Weathering With You" provides us with a perspective that changes the perspective
<font color=#FFF500FF>Do you know? The area in Tokyo used to be a sea</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>Until about 200 years ago</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>It is said that Edo itself is a bay</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>Then things slowly changed due to human activities and weather</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>So, just restore it to the original condition</font>
Sinking of Tokyo no longer considered a disaster
Instead, it achieves natural rhythm
It is said that 300 years ago
A major earthquake occurred in the Taipei Basin
Let Taipei become a lake
If Taipei in the future is submerged due to global warming
From the perspective of the earth
In fact, it’s just a return to the way it was 300 years ago.
There is a group of scientists who believe that
The origin of life on Earth originated from comet impacts that brought organic molecules to the Earth.
So it was the impact of comets billions of years ago that brought us life
if hit again
It’s just a pure celestial motion cycle
Just like the knot of the Itomori family
Interrupted and entangled again
Nature itself does not have any value judgments of good and evil
Just like in "Journey to Suzuya"
The earthquake caused the earthquake without any intention
neither good nor evil
Just pure natural movement
In this way
Makoto Shinkai’s Disaster Ethics
It becomes a kind of anti-ethics
so called disaster
Purely natural cyclical movement
There is no good or evil
It's just that younger generations are born into this era of climate crisis.
This origin seems to be an accident
Just like Mitsuha in "Your Name" who happened to encounter a comet that happens once every 1,200 years
Haruyo from "Weathering With You" happened to encounter Tokyo's unusual weather
The protagonist of "Suzuya's Journey" happens to encounter the door of disaster
etc.
Is this really just a coincidence?
Japanese philosopher Kuuki Shuzo believes that
Things that seem accidental
In fact, there is some kind of necessity hidden
For example, a clover sometimes grows four leaves.
This seems to be some kind of exception, accidental
But this accident can be traced back to an inevitable reason
For example, growth variation caused by strong winds during germination
And turned into four leaves
Strong winds are determined by the humidity of the day
The buds of clover are determined by the growth status of the day
Strong wind and clover are both inevitable.
It’s just that these two are bound to meet.
So there was a seemingly accidental result
The clover grew into a four-leaf clover
Same in "Your Name"
The exchange of souls between the male and female protagonists seems to be an accident
no purpose
But in the end, the story reveals that there is some kind of necessity behind the accident.
<font color=#FFF500FF>When I was young</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>I also had incredible dreams</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>It seems like I am someone else in my dream</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>Treasure it</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>Dreams are always forgotten after waking up</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>Your mother and I have also experienced this</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>Should it be</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>This kind of dream the people of the Miyamizu family have</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>It’s all for today</font>
Every action Sanye takes
They are all practicing their own free will
develop her own causal sequence
Comets periodically hit Itomori every 1,200 years
It is also the inevitable causal sequence of the comet itself.
so called accident
In fact, it is two independent binary causal sequences.
An encounter occurred
It became a "destined accident"
This contradictory statement cannot be expressed in Western philosophy
He was called "fate" by Kuki Shuzo
Fate is the encounter between two originally independent causal sequences.
But I don’t know the necessity behind this
It's as if we have met before in previous lives
<font color=#FFF500FF>No matter where you are in the world</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>I will definitely find you too</font>
Two people because of some accident
Born together in an era of disaster
It may also be due to some accident
Accidentally exchanged souls
Or died in a disaster due to some accident
But there is always some kind of necessity behind these accidents
Let us meet each other at some point in time
Your name is
