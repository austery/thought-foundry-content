Hi
 everybody
 and
 welcome
 to
 in
 good


company.
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangan
 the
 CEO
 of


the
 Norwegian
 S
 wealth
 fund
 and
 today


I'm
 in
 particularly
 good
 company
 with


Saul
 Pearlmter
 who
 I
 would
 argue
 easily


is
 the
 cleverest
 person
 we
 ever
 had
 on


the
 podcast
 because
 Soul
 won
 the
 Nobel


Prize
 in
 physics
 for
 discovering
 that


the
 universe
 expands
 at
 an
 increasingly


rapid
 pace.
 Now
 you
 also
 written
 a
 book


called
 Third
 Millennium
 Thinking
 which


teaches
 us
 how
 to
 use
 scientific
 method


in
 order
 to
 navigate
 this
 increasingly


uncertain
 world.
 So
 big
 welcome
 to
 to


this
 podcast.


>> Thank
 you.
 It's
 good
 to
 be
 here.


>> I
 thought
 we
 could
 start
 with
 the
 book


and
 kind
 of
 the
 scientific
 thinking.
 So


what
 is
 third
 millennium
 thinking?
 Well,


it's
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 of
 a
 odd
 name
 because


what
 we
 really
 want
 to
 capture
 is
 the


direction
 in
 which
 we
 think
 the
 best
 of


our
 scientific
 style
 of
 thinking
 has


been
 helping
 our
 whole
 society
 uh
 be


able
 to
 do
 better
 in
 working
 through


problems
 together.
 And
 we
 want
 to
 try
 to


capture
 what
 does
 that
 really
 look
 like


so
 that
 people
 um
 can
 realize
 that


there's
 so
 many
 elements
 of
 it
 they


could
 all
 be
 using
 in
 their
 daily
 life


and
 also
 they
 could
 be
 using
 when


they're
 talking
 to
 other
 people
 and


working
 out
 problems
 together.
 M


>> and
 uh
 in
 some
 sense
 I'd
 say
 that
 we've


learned
 by
 now
 how
 to
 solve
 really


dramatic
 problems
 and
 and
 difficult


problems
 and
 interesting
 problems
 in
 the


world.
 The
 one
 that
 I
 feel
 is
 the


leftover
 problem
 that
 we
 can
 make
 a
 huge


difference
 if
 we
 can
 solve
 is
 just
 how


to
 talk
 to
 each
 other,
 how
 to
 work


problems
 out
 together
 so
 that
 we
 can


actually
 use
 all
 these
 other
 techniques


that
 we've
 learned


>> because
 the
 first
 time
 I
 met
 when
 we


when
 we
 spoke
 you
 said
 uh
 you
 know


Nikolai
 we
 can
 now
 solve
 all
 the


problems
 in
 the
 world
 uh
 you
 know


climate
 how
 to
 feed
 people
 but
 we
 don't


manage
 to
 because
 we
 don't
 talk
 to
 each


other.
 I
 mean
 it's
 remarkable.
 I
 think


we
 actually
 live
 at
 a
 incredible
 moment


in
 in
 history
 and
 prehistory
 and
 uh
 and


in
 fact
 you
 know
 maybe
 even
 cosmic


history
 um
 where
 we
 are
 the
 first


generations
 on
 this
 planet
 um
 who
 have


the
 ability
 to
 solve
 planetary
 sized


problems.
 I
 think
 you
 know
 the
 uh
 the


idea
 that
 there
 could
 be
 a
 pandemic
 and


we
 actually
 know
 what
 to
 do
 about
 a


pandemic.
 Um,
 we
 have
 billions
 of
 people


living
 on
 the
 on
 the
 planet,
 many
 more


than
 when
 we
 were
 children.
 And
 we
 at


the
 time
 when
 we
 were
 children,
 most
 of


the
 world
 was
 going
 to
 bed
 hungry.


Today,
 that's
 a
 very
 small
 percentage.


And
 we've
 we
 now
 know
 how
 it's
 possible


to
 feed
 a
 planet.
 Uh,
 we
 can
 even
 handle


things
 like,
 you
 know,
 climate
 changes


that
 have
 happened
 throughout
 history


have
 wiped
 out
 civilizations
 at


different
 points
 in
 different
 ways.


Today,
 for
 the
 very
 first
 time
 ever,
 we


know
 how
 you
 could
 stabilize
 a
 a


climate.
 Um,
 and
 that
 we
 can
 actually


manage
 that.
 We
 could
 even
 manage
 the
 uh


the,
 you
 know,
 the
 thing
 that
 killed
 the


dinosaurs,
 the
 the
 you
 know,
 possibility


of
 a
 comet
 or
 asteroid
 hitting
 the


earth.
 And
 and
 that
 one
 wiped
 out,
 you


know,
 most
 of
 the
 families
 of
 species
 on


the
 planet.
 That's
 something
 even
 that


we
 have
 the
 possibility
 of
 of
 being
 able


to
 solve
 that
 problem.


>> That's
 a
 pretty
 pretty
 pretty
 incredible


starting
 point,
 right?
 So
 it
 seems
 like


the
 one
 thing
 that
 we
 should
 all
 be


enjoying
 today
 if
 we
 had
 had
 that
 a


moment
 to
 just
 to
 breathe
 and
 ask
 each


other
 what
 is
 the
 world
 that
 we
 want
 to


live
 in
 this
 would
 be
 the
 moment
 where


we
 could
 all
 be
 saying
 you
 know
 turn
 to


each
 other
 and
 saying
 okay
 now
 finally


we
 can
 build
 a
 planet
 that
 we
 just
 all


be
 proud
 to
 live
 in
 and
 at
 that
 very


moment
 we're
 having
 a
 hard
 time


>> interacting
 with
 each
 other
 and


communicating
 well
 enough
 in
 a


productive
 way
 so
 that
 we
 can
 do
 these


work.


>> So
 what
 is
 a
 scientific
 method?
 It's
 a


so
 when
 you
 say
 the
 scientific
 method
 I


mean
 often
 many
 of
 us
 have
 been
 taught


something
 called
 the
 scientific
 method


in
 in in
 school
 which
 was
 just
 this


hypothesis
 testing
 concept.
 Um
 but


that's
 just
 one
 piece
 of
 this
 whole


culture
 of
 a
 grabag
 of
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of


different
 ideas
 that
 together
 make
 a
 an


approach
 to
 think
 about
 the
 world.
 It


includes
 things
 like
 thinking
 of
 the


world
 probabilistically
 that
 um
 we
 don't


tend
 to
 know
 we
 very
 rarely
 know


anything
 absolutely
 true
 or
 absolutely


false.
 Generally,
 we
 have
 a
 fairly


strong
 sense
 that
 this
 is
 very
 likely
 to


be
 true.
 Something
 else
 we
 would
 bet
 our


lives
 on
 being
 true.
 Something
 else


we're
 not
 sure
 is
 true.
 And
 that's


actually
 a
 very
 useful
 differentiation.


It's
 not
 uh
 black
 and
 white,
 yes
 or
 no.


It's
 this
 one
 I'm
 going
 to
 bet
 90%
 on,


but
 this
 one
 I'm
 only
 going
 to
 give,
 you


know,
 70%
 uh
 bet
 on.
 And
 that
 makes
 us


very
 powerful.
 It
 turns
 out
 we
 actually


can
 do
 a
 lot
 more
 that
 way
 than
 than
 in


just
 saying
 absolutely
 known
 or


absolutely
 unknown.
 How
 do
 you
 think


about
 your
 life
 in
 probabilistic
 terms?


>> Well,
 in
 our
 day-to-day
 lives,
 it
 comes


up
 all
 the
 time.
 Uh
 we
 are
 having
 to


make
 you
 know,
 well,
 some
 of
 them
 we


just
 are
 we're
 very
 used
 to.
 We
 we
 make


a
 bet
 on
 whether
 it's
 safe
 to
 cross
 the


street
 and
 and
 you
 know,
 we
 are
 pretty


good
 at
 that.
 Um
 some
 of
 them
 we


occasionally
 are
 forced
 to
 think
 very


hard
 about
 when
 we
 have
 to
 make
 a
 health


care
 decision.
 So,
 you
 know,
 should
 you


uh
 take
 this
 medicine?
 Should
 you
 uh
 you


know,
 people
 have
 to
 decide
 whether
 to


get
 a
 certain
 operation.
 um
 those
 you


actually
 have
 to
 think
 through
 very


carefully
 what
 the
 odds
 are
 and
 what
 the


what
 the
 uh
 but
 and
 how
 much
 you
 should


risk
 but
 those
 are
 things
 that
 we
 I


think
 would
 so
 recognize
 that
 we
 do
 but


it
 is
 hidden
 in
 many
 many
 of
 the
 other


just
 day-to-day
 activities
 that
 we
 do


and
 when
 we
 make
 decisions
 as
 a
 group
 we


don't
 usually
 remember
 that
 and
 we
 don't


remember
 that
 actually
 we
 should
 be


using
 this
 as
 a
 way
 of
 not
 getting


overly
 attached
 to
 any
 part
 of
 the
 of


the
 argument
 but
 being
 willing
 to


consider
 well
 I
 could
 be
 wrong
 I
 mean


75%
 80%
 sure
 I'm
 right
 but
 there's
 25%


odds
 that
 I'm
 wrong
 in
 this
 one
 if
 in


which
 case
 maybe
 your
 point
 might
 be
 the


right
 point
 in
 this
 particular


discussion
 and
 uh
 and
 it
 makes
 it
 a
 much


more
 of
 a
 fluid
 discussion
 much
 more


possible
 for
 groups
 to
 think
 through


problems
 in
 a
 without
 being
 attached
 to


the
 to
 their
 position


>> you
 talk
 about
 something
 called


individual
 humility
 and
 collective


arrogance
 what
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 that


>> so
 the
 these
 parts
 of
 the
 story
 where


you
 uh
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 understand


that
 most
 of
 what
 we
 did
 as
 scientists


that
 was
 has
 been
 has
 made
 successful
 is


to
 consider
 the
 possibility
 that
 we're


making
 a
 mistake
 and
 that
 we're
 getting


something
 wrong.
 And
 that
 is
 probably


95%
 of
 an
 experimental
 scientist's
 life


is
 looking
 for
 where
 are
 the
 mistakes


this
 time
 in
 in
 the
 experiment
 they're


running
 in
 the
 uh
 in
 the
 um
 theory
 that


they're
 working
 with.
 Um
 if
 they're


day-to-day,
 you
 know,
 most
 measurements


have
 some
 error
 to
 them.
 You
 have
 to


figure
 out
 what
 the
 amount
 of
 error
 is


that's
 that
 is
 permissible
 for
 the


particular
 measurement
 you're
 making.
 Um


but
 and
 that's
 part
 of
 the
 mistakes
 that


are
 there
 in
 front
 of
 you.
 what
 you're


really
 looking
 for
 is
 you're
 really


hoping
 you
 find
 mistakes
 in
 the


fundamental
 theories
 that
 you're
 working


with.
 So
 if
 when
 you
 find
 out
 there's


something
 wrong
 with
 our
 understanding


of
 gravity,
 that
 was
 really
 exciting.
 Um


and
 that
 was,
 you
 know,
 what
 what
 made


Einstein
 uh
 you
 know,
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 made
 him
 famous.
 Um
 and
 and
 most


scientists,
 they're
 constantly
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 and
 push
 the
 edges
 of
 what
 is


it
 that
 we
 are
 fairly
 sure
 about,
 but


what
 things
 would
 we
 be
 would
 be
 amazing


if
 it
 turned
 out
 that
 the
 world
 was
 a


little
 bit
 different
 than
 we
 thought.


And
 that
 is
 actually
 where
 our
 strength


comes
 from,
 that
 ability
 to
 be


constantly
 questioning.
 Um,
 and
 it


sounds
 like
 a
 weakness
 to
 always
 be


doubting,
 but
 it
 it
 turns
 out
 I
 think


that's
 really
 where
 our
 superpower
 lies.


>> Now,
 that's
 easier
 if
 you
 work
 in
 a


team,
 right?
 So,
 what's
 so
 special
 about


teams?


>> There's
 a
 there's
 a
 couple
 aspects
 to


this.
 One
 is
 that
 I
 think
 it's
 very


easy,
 very
 hard
 to
 think
 outside
 of
 your


own
 head
 when
 you're
 by
 yourself.
 And
 as


soon
 as
 you
 start
 talking
 to
 other


people,
 it
 opens
 up
 the
 range
 of


possibilities.
 Even
 more
 difficult,
 but


even
 more
 important
 is
 talking
 to
 people


that
 you
 think
 that
 you
 disagree
 with.


And
 so,
 science
 has
 built
 a
 whole


tradition
 of
 taking
 your
 work
 and


putting
 it
 in
 front
 of
 people
 who
 are


going to
 give
 it
 a
 hard
 time
 and
 are


going
 to
 show
 all
 the
 flaws
 in
 it.
 And


that's
 actually
 one
 of
 the
 most


successful
 ways
 to
 figure
 out
 where
 you


may
 be
 going
 wrong.
 Our
 society
 as
 a


larger
 society
 seems
 to
 have
 lost
 a
 lot


of
 that
 skill
 um
 or
 or
 that
 memory
 of
 of


why
 it
 is
 that
 you
 talk
 to
 people
 that


you
 disagree
 with
 and
 where
 the


usefulness
 of
 it
 comes
 in.
 Why
 has


society
 lost
 this?
 I
 think
 we
 happen
 to


go
 through
 different
 waves
 um
 in
 in
 our


um
 in
 our
 communication
 with
 each
 other


and
 some
 of
 them
 tend
 to
 be
 um
 oh
 they


tend
 to
 corner
 people
 into
 um
 groups


where
 they
 are
 only
 talking
 to
 people


who
 already
 agree
 with
 them
 and
 then


they
 find
 that
 the
 other
 groups
 sound


scary
 and
 the
 other
 groups
 that
 from
 the


outside
 it's
 very
 easy
 um
 for
 for
 a


group
 that
 was
 that's
 talking
 among


themselves
 and
 you're
 talking
 with
 a


different
 for
 the
 other
 group
 to
 look


like
 they're
 just
 bad
 in
 some
 way,
 evil


or
 or
 out
 to
 do
 something
 that
 you
 that


you
 don't
 trust.
 But
 when
 people


actually
 communicate
 with
 each
 other
 and


think
 through
 problems
 together,
 almost


invariably
 they
 start
 discovering
 that


the
 actual
 people
 themselves
 that
 may
 be


in
 these
 separate
 bubbles
 of


communication
 turn
 out
 to
 really
 share


almost
 all
 of
 the
 same
 big
 goals.
 And


the
 differences
 are
 much
 more
 just
 the


question
 of
 what
 do
 they
 think
 the


answer
 is
 to
 some
 factual
 question
 u


rather
 than
 really
 their
 priorities


being
 completely
 different.


>> But
 if
 you
 work
 with
 um
 somebody
 whose


job
 is
 to
 shoot
 down
 your
 arguments
 um


do
 do
 is
 there
 less
 room
 for
 ego
 in


science
 than
 in
 other
 parts
 of
 society.


>> Well
 I
 always
 describe
 the
 the


aspirational
 aspects
 of
 science
 as


opposed
 to
 the
 what
 actually
 happens


day-to-day.


>> Dayto
 day
 people
 do
 things
 wrong


dayto-day.
 they
 they
 don't
 follow
 the


prescriptions
 of
 of
 you
 know
 I
 think


what
 this
 best
 idea
 of
 what
 science
 and


this
 third
 millennium
 thinking
 that
 I'm


describing
 has
 offered
 us
 um
 as
 a
 whole


though
 um
 that's
 the
 aspirational
 goal


to
 be
 open
 to
 being
 to
 listening
 when


somebody
 gives
 you
 criticism
 and
 it's


very
 difficult
 to
 do
 not
 every
 scientist


does
 it
 every
 time
 but
 in
 the
 big


picture
 eventually
 people
 listen
 to
 the


the
 referee's
 comments
 on
 papers
 they


they
 listen
 to
 the
 uh
 the
 objections


raised
 in
 a
 conference
 when
 they're


giving
 a
 talk
 um
 And
 it
 ends
 up
 actually


making
 a
 big
 difference.
 It
 means
 that,


you
 know,
 they
 they
 may
 not
 want
 to
 hear


it
 the
 first
 three
 or
 four
 times,
 but


eventually
 they
 think,
 you
 know,
 I've


got
 to
 answer
 that
 question.
 And
 that


sharpens
 up
 their
 thinking.


>> So,
 it's
 kind
 of
 tied
 into
 the
 whole


confident
 humility.


>> Absolutely.
 Concept.


>> Absolutely.
 And,
 you
 know,
 I
 don't
 think


of
 the
 the
 the
 typical
 image
 of
 a


scientist
 as
 being
 a
 humble
 uh
 uh
 you


person.
 But


>> are
 you
 humble?


>> In
 this
 particular
 respect,
 I
 think
 um
 I


aspire
 to
 being
 as
 humble
 as
 I
 can,


right?
 I
 know
 that
 I've
 done
 things


wrong
 and
 I've
 figured
 things
 I've
 I've


missed
 made
 mistakes
 and
 I've
 caught


them
 sometimes
 myself
 but
 other
 times


I've
 only
 caught
 them
 because
 somebody


else
 was
 there.
 Um
 and
 which
 parts
 of


you
 are
 less
 humble?


>> So
 so
 I
 think
 the
 part
 that
 that's
 less


humble
 is
 is
 actually
 sort
 of
 an


interesting
 one.
 Um
 I
 there's
 another


side
 of
 the
 culture
 of
 science
 which
 I


think
 has
 to
 be
 um
 arrogant
 in
 a
 very


interesting
 way
 which
 is
 that
 you
 I


think
 science
 has
 benefited
 by
 having
 a


culture
 that
 allows
 you
 to
 believe
 or


maybe
 even
 fool
 yourself
 into
 thinking


that
 you
 can
 solve
 difficult
 problems


>> long
 enough
 to
 solve
 them.
 And
 and
 the


problem
 is
 that
 most
 of
 us
 I
 don't
 think


are
 built
 to
 stick
 to
 a
 problem
 as
 long


as
 it
 really
 takes.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 we


tend
 to
 um
 think
 well
 I
 tried
 very
 hard


on
 that
 problem.
 I
 spent
 at least
 a
 day


on
 it.
 Maybe
 I
 spent
 a
 week
 on
 it.
 Um


and
 then
 you
 give
 up.
 Um
 whereas
 the


culture
 of
 science
 has
 I
 think
 led


people
 to
 think
 we
 can
 solve
 that


problem
 and
 if
 we
 didn't
 figure
 it
 out


that
 week
 we'll
 keep
 working
 on
 it
 and


we
 see
 some
 progress
 maybe
 by
 you
 know
 a


month
 or
 so
 from
 now
 we'll
 try
 something


different
 and
 then
 another
 month
 and


eventually
 people
 figure
 out
 these
 these


problems.
 And
 it
 takes
 a
 certain
 kind
 of


um
 confidence,
 a
 certain
 kind
 of
 of
 and


I
 you
 can
 you
 can
 call
 it
 arrogance.
 I


think
 I
 think
 to
 to
 manage
 to
 stay
 with


a
 problem
 long
 enough
 to
 to
 do
 these


problems
 that
 are
 worth
 that
 are
 worth


our
 solving.


>> Well,
 you
 have
 to
 kind
 of
 you
 have
 to
 be


a
 bit
 of
 a
 diehard
 believer
 in
 your
 own


brilliance,
 right?


>> Exactly.
 And
 and
 it's
 a
 very
 strange


thing
 because
 you
 want
 what
 you
 really


want
 is
 this
 funny
 balance
 between
 being


very
 humble
 and
 very
 willing
 to
 be
 wrong


>> and
 yet
 very
 can
 do
 that
 we're
 going
 to


be
 able
 to
 figure
 this
 thing
 out
 so
 that


you
 if
 it
 doesn't
 work
 you
 think
 there's


got
 to
 be
 a
 different
 way
 we
 can
 do
 this


and
 that
 is
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 real


secrets
 of
 this
 of
 how
 science
 has


worked
 this
 this
 in
 some
 sense
 it's
 the


the
 breaks
 um
 of
 the
 of of
 making


mistakes
 that
 so
 many
 of the
 things
 that


science
 involves
 is
 the
 skepticisms
 and


the
 doubts
 that
 keep
 you
 from
 falling


into
 certain
 kinds
 of
 mental
 traps.
 But


you
 can't
 drive
 a
 car
 with
 just
 brakes.


You
 you
 need,
 you
 know,
 you
 need
 an


accelerator
 pedal.
 And
 I
 think
 that


accelerator
 pedal
 is
 this
 can
 do
 sense


that
 we
 can
 figure
 this
 out.
 You
 know,


it's
 a
 pro.
 It's
 a
 hard
 problem,
 but


once
 you
 identify
 the
 problem,
 we
 have
 a


reasonable
 chance
 of
 of
 figuring
 out
 how


to
 solve
 it.


>> What
 makes
 a
 good
 team?
 What
 I've
 seen


that
 for
 me
 at
 least
 that
 that's
 been
 uh


the
 thing
 that's
 made
 a
 huge
 difference


is
 that
 combination
 of
 people
 who
 come


in
 with
 a
 wide
 variety
 of
 skills
 um
 but


who
 aren't
 so
 ego-driven
 that
 they
 can't


uh
 just
 join
 a
 group
 together
 and
 bounce


ideas
 with
 each
 other
 and
 listen
 to
 each


other.
 And
 that
 combination
 of
 people


who
 are
 very
 capable
 but
 are
 also
 able


to
 to
 enjoy
 the
 the
 team
 nature
 and
 and


and
 thinking
 together.
 That's
 the
 thing


that
 I
 usually
 am
 looking
 for
 in
 a
 in
 in


a
 group
 along
 a
 little
 bit
 with
 that
 you


know
 you
 always
 want
 the
 person
 to
 be


very
 skilled
 and
 capable
 and
 but
 you


also
 want
 them
 have
 a
 little
 that
 can
 do


spirit
 that
 they
 think
 that
 it's
 worth


staying
 in
 the
 room
 with
 the
 group
 of


people
 and
 and
 worrying
 the
 problem
 for


that
 extra
 time
 that
 you
 know
 most


people
 wouldn't.
 Increasingly
 um
 Nobel


prizes
 are
 worn
 by
 teams.


>> So
 the
 in
 general
 science
 has
 become


less
 and
 less
 of
 a
 you
 know
 single


person
 activity
 you
 know
 with
 the
 image


of
 the
 lone
 scientist
 putting
 on
 their


lab
 coat
 and
 going
 down
 to
 the
 lab
 and


disappearing.
 Um
 that's
 never
 that's
 not


been
 my
 experience
 at
 all.
 And
 uh
 and


even
 rather
 small
 groups
 are
 still
 often


groups
 um
 of
 of
 people
 doing
 projects.


And
 a
 lot
 of
 science
 just
 requires


enough


different
 expertise
 and
 different
 parts


and
 the
 scales
 have
 gotten
 big
 enough


that
 they
 often
 are
 fairly
 big
 teams.


They're
 you
 know
 the
 uh
 the
 projects
 I


was
 doing
 were
 smallish
 in
 the
 sense
 of


maybe
 30
 you
 know
 30
 people
 uh
 you
 know


all
 working
 together
 on
 something.
 Um


but
 the
 very
 next
 stage
 of
 those
 same


projects
 in
 in
 more
 recent
 years
 are
 now


hundreds
 of
 of
 people
 on
 those
 projects.


What
 are
 the
 challenges
 in
 terms
 of


splitting
 the
 work
 and
 managing
 that


whole
 process?


>> It's
 very
 tricky
 because
 you
 you
 um
 have


all
 sorts
 of
 balancing
 acts
 to
 do.
 So


there's
 the
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 want


groups
 of
 people
 to
 share
 a
 lot
 of
 of


their
 approaches
 and
 other
 resources.


They
 might
 share
 their
 software
 uh
 with


each
 other
 to
 work
 on
 it.
 But
 there's
 a


danger
 um
 then
 that
 if
 they've
 shared


too
 much,
 then
 you
 don't
 get
 the
 um
 the


independent
 comparisons
 that
 that
 you


can
 often
 find
 the
 errors
 with.
 So
 you


you
 in
 some
 sense
 need
 to
 encourage
 um


sort
 of
 splinter
 groups
 to
 be
 working
 on


things
 while
 the
 whole
 group
 is
 is


coming
 to
 a
 consensus
 at
 the
 same
 time.


And
 that
 these
 balancing
 acts
 actually


go
 throughout
 the
 whole
 third
 millennium


thinking
 story
 that
 in
 that
 book
 uh
 is


that
 most
 things
 you're
 doing
 you're


having
 to
 get
 that
 right
 ch
 balance


between
 several
 different
 things
 you're


trying
 to
 achieve
 that
 aren't


necessarily
 obvious
 that
 you
 would
 do


them
 at
 the
 same
 time.


>> How
 does
 chamber
 music
 come
 into
 this?


Because
 that's
 one
 of
 your
 teams.
 So
 I


was
 I
 was
 thinking
 about
 uh
 this
 from


the
 point
 of
 view
 of
 um
 you
 know
 who


have
 been
 some
 of
 my
 more
 influential


teachers
 in
 in
 my
 life
 and
 uh
 and
 you


know
 some
 of
 them
 you
 know
 it's
 obvious


uh
 a
 my
 research
 adviser
 was
 you
 know


very
 influential
 as
 when
 I
 was
 going
 my


PhD
 in
 physics
 and
 and
 others
 you
 know


are
 in
 that
 category
 of
 you
 know


teachers
 that
 in
 certain
 courses
 that


you've
 taken
 that
 that
 I
 I
 still


remember
 but
 perhaps
 one
 of
 the
 more
 uh


um
 interesting
 ones
 is
 for
 those
 people


who've
 taken
 studied
 a
 an
 instrument
 um


in
 their
 lives
 um
 your
 your
 teacher
 of


that
 instrument
 has
 stayed
 with
 you
 for


usually
 had
 stayed
 with
 you
 for
 many


many
 years
 um
 while
 you
 were
 growing
 up.


And
 so
 in
 my
 case
 my
 violin
 teacher
 was


a
 was
 a
 very
 influential
 person.
 Her


name
 her her
 name
 was
 Francis
 Stuffy
 and


she
 um
 was
 able
 to
 teach
 a
 certain


degree
 of
 this
 this
 mix
 of
 extreme
 care


and
 and
 and
 precision
 but
 with
 a
 spirit


and
 a
 and
 a
 and
 a
 goal
 of
 making
 music


not
 of
 uh
 of
 of
 just
 doing
 something


right,
 you
 know.
 And


>> do
 you
 still
 play?


>> And
 I
 do
 still
 play.
 And
 the
 and
 the


thing
 that
 I
 was
 always
 interested
 in


when
 I
 was
 playing
 was
 not
 solo
 music.
 I


was
 interested
 in
 playing
 string


quartets
 and
 other
 kinds
 of
 chamber


music.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 pleasures
 in
 that


are
 are
 very
 much
 some
 of
 the
 same


pleasures
 as
 in
 group
 uh
 efforts
 for


like
 science
 solving
 a
 scientific


problem
 that
 you
 have
 a
 group
 of
 people


who
 are
 all
 contributing
 something
 but


they
 have
 to
 listen
 to
 each
 other
 and


and
 the
 then
 the
 degree
 of
 of
 paying


attention
 back
 and
 forth
 I
 think
 is
 what


makes
 that
 so
 enlivening
 and
 it's
 also
 I


think
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 makes
 a


group
 science
 project
 fun.


>> What
 is
 blind
 analysis?
 One
 of
 the


classic
 problems
 that
 uh
 that
 we
 that


we've
 become
 aware
 of
 um
 actually
 in
 in


the
 larger
 world,
 we
 see
 it
 in
 this


thing
 called
 confirmation
 bias.
 Um
 where


you
 it's
 very
 easy
 when
 you're
 let's
 say


trying
 to
 see
 what
 uh
 what
 some
 news


story
 is
 telling
 you.
 Um
 to
 fall
 into


the
 danger
 of
 only
 reading
 the
 news


stories
 that
 already
 tell
 you
 something


that
 you
 believe
 and
 not
 reading
 the


ones
 that
 are
 giving
 you
 um
 information


that
 would
 disagree
 with
 something
 you


believe.
 And
 when
 you
 do
 happen
 to
 read


an
 article
 that
 says
 something
 that's


disagrees
 with
 something
 that
 you
 that


you
 think
 is
 right,
 um
 you
 would
 you


look
 for
 all
 the
 things
 all
 the
 mistakes


it's
 making.
 Whereas
 when
 you
 see
 an


article
 that's
 saying,
 "Oh,
 somebody
 did


a
 study
 and
 it
 and
 it
 agrees
 with


something
 you
 that
 you
 like."
 You
 don't


look
 for
 its
 flaws
 in
 the
 same
 way.


>> And
 this
 happens
 actually
 not
 only
 in


like
 politics
 and
 and
 and
 when
 you're


reading
 the
 newspaper,
 but
 in
 a
 science


project.
 Um
 so
 when
 you're
 measuring


some
 you
 know
 some
 uh
 you
 know
 graph
 the


points
 for
 a
 graph
 and
 it's
 going
 to


agree
 with
 a
 theory
 or
 disagree
 with
 a


theory
 and
 you're
 very
 excited
 to
 see


what
 the
 results
 are.
 Um
 there's
 a
 real


danger
 that
 and
 you
 and
 you
 see
 it
 has


happened
 now
 in
 in
 history.
 You
 can
 go


back
 and
 look
 through
 the
 the
 uh
 graphs


of
 of
 the
 past
 and
 you
 see
 that
 there's


a
 danger
 that
 people
 accept
 the
 graph


when
 it's
 when
 they
 think
 it's
 showing


you
 what
 they
 were
 sort
 of
 expecting
 to


see
 either
 because
 it
 confirmed
 a
 theory


or
 it
 disagreed
 with
 theory
 whichever
 it


was
 that
 they
 were
 kind
 of
 expecting
 it


to
 show
 and
 they're
 more
 likely
 to
 look


for
 the
 errors
 in
 that
 in
 that
 graph
 um


if
 it's
 showing
 something
 that
 they


don't
 expect.
 So
 that
 means
 that
 there's


a
 real
 bias
 towards
 having
 graphs
 come


out
 in
 papers
 that
 are
 just
 what
 the


scientist
 was
 expecting
 to
 to
 get


because
 those
 are
 the
 ones
 that
 they


don't
 go
 hunting
 for
 the
 errors
 in


>> the
 and
 in
 recent
 years
 that
 was
 that's


become
 something
 where
 the
 physicists


started
 to
 become
 aware
 that
 this
 was
 a


trap
 that
 people
 were
 falling
 into
 and


one
 of
 the
 whole
 ideas
 of
 science
 is
 to


recognize
 these
 traps
 and
 then
 to
 figure


out
 how
 to
 solve
 them.
 So
 the
 way
 the


physics
 the
 physics
 community
 has


started
 to
 solve
 this
 particular
 trap
 is


they've
 started
 using
 this
 technique


called
 blind
 analysis
 where
 you
 don't


let
 your
 see
 let
 yourself
 see
 the


results
 the
 the
 final
 graphs
 with
 the


real
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 real
 uh
 values
 on


the
 graph
 um
 until
 everybody
 has
 agreed


that
 you've
 looked
 for
 all
 the
 errors
 in


the
 measurement.
 And
 then
 when
 you've


checked
 for
 all
 the
 errors,
 then
 you


open
 the
 envelope
 and
 you
 see
 what
 the


numbers
 correspond
 to
 and
 and
 you
 see


whether
 the
 the
 answer
 is
 what
 you
 were


expecting
 or
 what
 you
 wanted
 or
 if
 it


goes
 against
 what
 you
 wanted
 or
 were


expecting.
 And
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 kind
 of


dramatic
 moment.
 Um
 so
 uh
 you
 I've
 been


in
 we've
 been
 in
 the
 group
 meetings


where
 we
 were
 sitting
 there
 was
 the
 end


of
 the
 day
 and
 one
 of
 our
 students
 had


was
 about
 to
 unblind
 their
 data
 that


they've
 been
 working
 over
 the
 last
 year


and
 a
 half
 and
 if
 they
 came
 out
 a


certain
 way
 they
 would
 have
 a
 wonderful


PhD
 thesis.
 If
 it
 didn't,
 it
 would
 be
 a


disappointing
 uh
 result.
 And
 uh
 and
 it


was
 all
 going
 to
 depend
 on
 what
 happened


when
 they
 opened
 this
 uh
 they
 opened


this
 blind
 blinded
 result.
 And
 uh
 I


remember
 one
 time
 particularly
 was
 like


late
 at
 night.
 We
 had
 gone
 for
 a
 long


long
 meeting
 and
 it
 was
 past
 dinner
 time


and
 we
 were
 trying
 to
 decide
 okay
 are
 we


going
 to
 open
 it
 now
 or
 should
 we
 wait


in
 the
 morning
 and
 do
 it
 when
 we're


fresh,
 you
 know, because
 if
 it
 comes
 out


wrong
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 really


devastating
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 Um
 uh


maybe
 we
 should
 wait
 until
 we're
 you


know
 sort
 of
 you
 know
 well
 rested
 etc.


And
 we
 all
 looked
 at
 each
 and
 said
 each


other
 and
 said,
 "Nah,
 let's
 look
 at
 it."


And
 so
 we
 decided
 that
 was
 the
 time
 that


we're
 going
 to
 unblind
 and
 we
 were
 going


to
 have
 to
 accept
 whatever
 we
 got.


>> And
 was
 it
 good?


>> That
 time
 it
 was
 good.


>> Not
 every
 time,
 but
 that
 time
 it
 was
 it


was


>> the
 whole
 concept
 of
 confirmation
 bias


is
 interesting,
 right?
 I
 mean,
 you
 got


one
 political
 view
 and
 then
 you
 only


watch
 Fox
 News,
 you
 got
 another
 point
 of


view,
 you
 only
 watch
 something
 else.


>> Exactly.


>> You
 know,
 this
 is
 I
 guess
 what
 creates


more
 of
 the
 polarization
 in
 society.


>> No,
 it's
 it's
 a
 a
 real
 problem.
 And
 and


also
 we
 tend
 to,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 are
 a


Fox
 News
 watcher
 watcher,
 when
 you
 see
 a


New
 York
 Times
 article,
 you
 assume
 that


it
 was
 you're
 very
 skeptical
 about
 it.


And
 if
 you're
 a
 New
 York
 Times
 reader


and
 you
 watch
 a
 Fox
 News
 story,
 you


assume
 that
 there's
 something
 something


got
 something
 wrong
 in
 it.
 And
 you
 tend


to
 look
 for
 all
 the
 errors
 um
 in
 the


other
 but
 not
 in
 your
 own
 uh
 your
 own


reporters.
 M
 and
 confirmation
 bias
 is


very
 very
 problematic
 also
 for
 investors


because
 you
 made
 an
 investment
 and
 the


only
 piece
 of
 news
 you
 you
 you
 read
 is


the
 stuff
 that's
 confirming
 your
 already


existing
 you
 know
 view.


>> I
 mean
 I
 think
 it's
 you
 know
 clearly


it's
 one
 of
 these
 deep
 problems
 that
 for


all
 of
 us
 for
 almost
 anything
 we're


doing
 we
 can
 fall
 into
 that
 trap.
 I
 I


been
 describing
 it
 also,
 you
 know,
 like


when
 you're
 trying
 to
 decide,
 let
 me
 use


the
 medical
 example
 again.
 Um,
 you're


trying
 to
 decide,
 you
 know,
 whether
 or


not
 you
 something
 is
 a
 good
 idea,
 bad


idea
 for
 medical
 treatment.
 And
 there's


a
 real
 temptation
 to
 um
 hunt
 on
 the


websites
 until
 you
 find
 uh
 one
 that
 that


um
 says
 what
 you
 want
 to
 hear.


>> And
 I
 think
 that,
 you
 know,
 the
 really


what
 you
 need
 to
 do
 is
 you
 need
 to
 first


uh
 without
 looking
 at
 what
 it
 says
 about


your
 particular
 case,
 look
 for
 which


websites
 do
 you
 trust
 more
 about


everything
 else
 besides
 that
 one.
 So


that
 you
 choose
 your
 website
 blinded


without
 knowing
 what
 it
 would
 say
 for


your
 particular
 case
 and
 then
 you
 read


what
 it
 recommends.


>> So
 listen
 now
 I
 have
 bought
 a
 million


dollars
 worth
 of
 Apple
 stock.


>> Yes.


>> Okay.
 And
 we
 have
 four
 people
 around
 in


the
 room
 here.
 Uh
 what's
 the
 best
 way
 to


analyze
 and
 question
 uh
 and
 research


whether
 we
 should
 own
 Apple
 or
 not.
 So


to
 begin
 with
 um
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 have


four
 people
 in
 the
 room
 um
 could
 be
 a


real
 asset,
 right?
 Because
 they
 they


could
 um
 have
 different
 sources
 of


information
 and
 be
 able
 to
 bring


different


>> Well,
 I'm
 sorry.
 Should
 we
 have
 four


people
 in
 the
 room?
 First
 of
 all,
 let's


start
 from
 to
 let's
 start
 from
 total


scratch.


>> Okay,
 so
 I
 I
 got
 a
 million
 million


dollars
 of
 Apple
 stock.
 How
 should
 we


decide
 whether
 that's
 a
 good
 investment?


All
 right.
 So
 obviously
 um
 part
 of
 the


story
 is
 what
 where
 is
 the
 information


in
 in
 out
 in
 the
 world
 that
 would
 give


you
 the
 most
 uh
 uh
 chance
 at
 doing
 good


predictions
 in
 in
 this
 case
 and
 you
 know


in
 this
 in
 this
 story
 of
 course
 you
 have


to
 decide
 you
 know
 where
 do
 you
 expect


the
 most
 information
 to
 lie.
 Is
 it
 going


to
 be
 with
 the
 people
 who
 are
 doing
 the


technology
 development?
 Is
 it
 going
 to


be
 with
 the
 people
 who are
 doing
 the


consumer
 uh
 research?
 Um
 will
 it
 be


actual
 consumers
 themselves
 that
 are


missed
 by
 the
 consumer
 research?
 And


depending
 on
 what
 where
 you
 think
 the


the
 you
 know
 the
 most
 information
 sits


um
 you
 might
 want
 to
 bring
 different
 uh


people
 to
 the
 table.
 Um
 my
 guess
 would


be
 um
 that
 in
 many
 of
 these
 of
 these


topics
 you
 you
 want
 a
 fairly
 broad
 range


of
 sources
 of
 information
 some
 that
 you


would
 not
 have
 even
 thought
 of
 and
 that


actually
 you
 know
 requires
 reaching
 more


people
 than
 you
 might
 typically
 uh
 do
 if


you're
 trying
 to
 bring
 information
 in.


You
 cannot
 have
 them
 all
 um
 get
 together


and
 start
 uh
 walking
 around
 the
 room


with
 the
 first
 person
 um
 saying
 uh
 all


the
 best
 reasons
 for
 why
 it
 is
 that
 they


would
 recommend
 the
 investment
 or
 not
 um


or
 what
 form
 to
 do
 it
 in.
 Um
 and
 then


have
 the
 next
 person
 talk
 and
 the
 next


person
 talk
 because
 they
 will
 be
 so


influenced
 by
 what
 the
 previous
 person


says
 that
 there's
 a
 real
 danger
 that
 you


just
 get
 heard
 thinking
 that
 people
 lock


in
 on
 what
 sounded
 like
 a
 very
 good


argument
 and
 they
 don't
 want
 to


embarrass
 themselves
 by
 bringing
 in
 some


other
 information
 that
 they
 have
 from
 a


different
 source.
 nor
 do
 they
 want
 to


sound
 like
 they're
 they're
 arguing.
 They


don't
 want
 to
 sound
 like
 they're


conflicting
 necessarily
 with
 the
 other


uh
 people
 or
 the
 previous
 person,
 you


know,
 in
 the
 room.
 So,
 it's
 much
 better


to
 get
 all
 the
 information
 written
 down


independently
 so
 people
 provide
 it


separately
 and
 then
 aggregate
 it.
 Then


people
 look
 at
 it
 together
 and
 try
 to


figure
 out
 okay
 now
 how
 do
 we
 work
 with


this
 all
 this
 information
 at
 the
 same


time.
 Um
 so
 there
 are a
 number
 of
 tools


that
 people
 have
 used
 for
 playing
 these


games
 in
 different
 uh
 different
 kinds
 of


organizational
 um
 activities
 that
 that


get
 the
 best
 of
 that
 when
 they
 when
 when


you
 can.
 Um
 I
 I
 particularly
 like
 um


some
 decisions
 that
 need
 both
 some


values
 in
 play
 as
 well
 as
 the
 factual


issues.
 Um
 some
 of
 those
 um
 seem
 to
 be


done
 very
 well
 with
 using
 random
 samples


of
 the
 population
 which
 of
 course
 is
 a


little
 bit
 different
 from
 uh
 from


probably
 what
 you'll
 be
 doing
 in
 an


investment
 case.
 Um
 but
 even
 there
 you


never
 know.
 It
 could
 be
 that
 having
 a


broader
 um
 random
 reach
 would
 reach
 the


source
 of
 information
 that
 it
 never


would
 have
 occurred
 to
 uh
 you
 know
 if


you
 were
 just
 stepping
 back
 and
 and


trying
 to
 choose
 your
 10
 people.
 I
 think


one
 of
 the


one
 of
 the
 really
 uh
 bad
 examples
 of


this
 bias
 is
 you
 know
 in
 the
 Norwegian


Supreme
 Court


uh
 the
 oldest
 and
 most
 experienced
 uh


member
 of
 the
 court
 speaks
 first.


>> Ah
 yes


>> and
 you
 have
 the
 lowest
 supposedly


disagreement
 of
 any
 court
 because
 of


that.


>> Now
 it
 sounds
 like
 the
 exact
 uh
 opposite


of
 this
 concept.
 Yeah.
 Because
 now


you're


>> in
 Sweden
 just
 around
 the
 corner.
 Y


>> uh
 is
 the
 youngest
 person
 who
 speaks


first.
 Is
 that
 right?
 Yeah.
 And
 you
 have


much
 more
 disagreement.


>> That's
 fascinating.


>> Is
 that
 unbelievable?
 No.


>> That's
 really
 interesting.
 That's
 really


very
 interesting.


>> But
 how
 can
 this
 last
 for
 years
 and


years
 and
 years?


>> I
 mean
 you
 you
 you
 hear
 about
 all
 of


these
 kinds
 of
 stories
 where
 you
 where


you
 realize
 those
 biases
 people
 should


be
 jumping
 on
 and
 asking
 how
 do
 how
 do


we
 fix
 that?
 I
 mean
 the
 other
 one
 I
 was


I
 remember
 reading
 about
 was
 I
 for
 where


it
 was
 where
 you
 they
 compared
 the
 um
 I


think
 the
 sentencing
 um
 after
 lunch
 and


before
 lunch.


>> Yeah.
 Absolutely.
 Right.
 And
 it
 was


>> totally
 if
 you
 if
 you're
 hungry
 bang
 you


are
 guilty
 in
 prison
 you
 go.


>> Yeah.
 Which
 is
 you
 know
 which
 is
 also


crazy
 you
 know
 that
 that
 that
 would
 be


allowed
 to
 go
 on
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 Yeah.


>> Incredible.
 Okay.
 So
 now
 we
 have
 we
 have


this
 uh
 investment
 case
 potential.
 Uh
 we


have
 people
 from
 all
 kind
 all
 over
 the


place.
 They
 written
 down
 what
 they


think.
 Okay.
 So
 nobody's
 biased
 by


anybody.
 So
 what
 do
 you
 do
 then?
 How
 do


you
 get
 some
 productivities
 agreement


going
 here?


>> So
 I
 do
 think
 that
 um
 now
 this
 is
 the


time
 where
 I
 think
 bringing
 people
 into


a
 room
 and
 encouraging
 them
 to
 actually


bounce
 ideas
 off
 each
 other
 and
 to
 be


thinking
 very
 hard
 about
 um
 the
 possible


ways
 in
 which
 the
 world
 could
 be


different
 than
 they
 think.
 So
 here
 is
 a


technique
 uh
 that
 we're
 was
 actually
 I


think
 might
 have
 been
 developed
 actually


originally
 for
 business
 purposes
 was


this
 technique
 called
 scenario
 planning.


Um
 this
 is
 something
 that
 uh
 uh
 that


I've
 um
 been
 Peter
 Schwarz
 was
 somebody


who
 I
 I
 came
 across
 who
 was
 teaching


this
 uh
 and
 uh
 he's
 has
 has
 a
 book
 on


this
 actually
 um
 but
 the
 their
 the
 goal


was
 to
 try
 and
 identify
 driving
 forces


that
 could
 change
 the
 future
 in
 in
 some


topic
 area.
 Um
 I
 mean
 in
 this
 case
 you


know
 I
 guess
 if
 we're
 talking
 about


Apple
 stock
 right
 it's
 it's
 a
 presumably


consumer
 uh
 computing
 you
 know
 um
 and


then
 trying
 to
 uh
 just
 have
 a
 group
 of


people
 that
 come
 from
 a
 wide
 a
 wide
 set


of
 backgrounds
 just
 begin
 by
 just


writing
 down
 all
 of
 the
 things
 that


could
 drive
 the
 future
 um
 with
 respect


to
 it.
 Is
 it
 you
 know
 going
 to
 be


resource
 uh
 availability?
 Is
 it
 um
 is
 it


going
 to
 be
 um
 economic
 uh
 growth?
 Um
 is


it
 going
 to
 be
 economic
 disparity
 of
 you


know
 different
 levels
 of
 income?
 Um
 will


it
 be
 uh
 you
 know
 odd
 things
 like


climate
 uh
 change?
 You
 know
 how
 could


that
 possibly
 affect
 uh
 you
 know
 the


consumer
 computing?
 Um
 will
 it
 be
 AI
 uh


you
 know
 coming
 to
 fruition
 in
 some
 new


way?
 Um
 and
 so
 they
 you
 write
 down
 a


whole
 group
 of
 these
 and
 you
 choose
 a


few
 of
 them
 even
 sometimes
 just
 two
 that


look
 like
 they'd
 be
 um
 completely


unrelated
 to
 each
 other.
 and
 and
 then


consider
 the
 extremes
 of
 those
 two
 um
 in


all
 four
 possibilities.
 So
 you
 know


let's
 say
 um
 a
 stagnant
 uh
 economy
 where


there
 is
 not
 much
 growth
 versus
 a
 very


rapidly
 growing
 economy
 and
 then
 in
 the


other
 direction
 maybe
 um
 you
 know
 you


might
 have
 chosen
 you
 know
 climate
 uh
 uh


strong
 you
 know
 large
 climate
 change
 and


you
 know
 and
 and
 climate
 stasis
 you
 know


where
 things
 stay
 roughly
 the
 same
 and


use
 look
 at
 all
 four
 of
 those


combinations
 and
 ask
 what
 would
 be
 our


best
 in
 this
 case
 investment
 in
 each
 of


those
 situations
 because
 it
 forces
 you


to
 think
 through
 um
 the
 the
 logic
 of
 um


of
 where
 where
 what
 things
 are
 robust


and
 what
 things
 aren't
 robust,
 whether


or
 not
 those
 particular
 futures
 are
 the


right
 answer.
 It's
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 very


useful
 way
 of
 being
 able
 to
 consider
 a


wider
 variety
 than
 you
 typically
 will


do.
 I
 mean,
 if
 you're
 just
 stuck


thinking
 about
 the
 future
 that
 everybody


else
 is
 talking
 about
 that
 you
 all


reading
 in
 the
 in
 the
 same
 newspapers,


>> how
 do
 you
 incentivize
 people
 to
 to


disagree
 and
 to
 find
 mistakes
 and
 and


flaws?
 Well,
 there's
 one
 of
 the
 reasons


why
 I
 think
 um
 intentionally
 um
 allowing


for
 different
 groups
 competing
 as


opposed
 to
 trying
 to
 get
 everybody
 to
 be


in
 one
 collaborative
 group
 um
 does
 make


a
 difference
 because
 then
 you
 naturally


get
 teams,
 you
 know,
 and
 the
 teams
 are


naturally
 um
 they
 naturally
 have
 the


incentive
 to
 look
 for
 the
 things
 that


the
 others
 may
 have
 gotten
 wrong.
 And
 I


think
 that's
 actually
 been
 one
 of the


very
 interesting
 ways
 in
 which
 science


has
 progressed
 that
 I
 think
 you've
 seen


that
 people
 have
 some
 uh
 real
 pleasure


in
 being
 able
 to
 find
 something
 that


nobody
 else
 found
 and
 one
 of the
 way
 one


ways
 that
 shows
 up
 is
 they
 they
 find
 the


flaws
 in
 the
 earlier
 thinking.
 Um,
 and
 I


think
 that
 if
 you
 can
 manage
 to
 do
 that


in
 any
 organization
 where
 you
 you


encourage
 there
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 of
 friendly


competition
 going
 on,
 uh,
 where
 people


are
 trying
 out
 ideas
 and
 that
 they're


encouraged
 to
 be
 disagreeing
 with
 each


other,
 that
 that's
 not
 seen
 as
 a
 as


unfriendly
 thing
 to
 do,
 but
 it's
 just


that's
 part
 of
 the
 the
 process.
 Um,
 I


think
 it's
 a
 culture
 that
 really
 helps


>> in
 in
 investments.
 Uh,
 the
 best


investments
 are
 typically


uh
 the
 cases
 where
 you
 are
 right
 and


nobody
 agrees
 with
 you,
 right?
 So
 really


counterintuitive
 uh
 findings.


>> Um
 is
 that
 also
 the
 case
 in
 science?


>> Absolutely.


>> So
 what
 are
 some
 of the
 most


counterintuitive


>> findings
 that
 you
 know
 of?


>> Well,
 I
 mean
 the
 uh
 well
 the
 only
 reason


>> but
 we're
 coming
 back
 to
 yours
 in


astrophysics.
 Right.
 So


>> right
 the
 only
 reason
 I
 won
 a
 Nobel


Prize
 was
 not
 because
 we
 had
 done
 what


was
 really
 fun
 great
 experiment.
 It
 was


because
 it
 came
 up
 with
 a
 real


surprising
 result.


>> Yeah.
 And
 it
 is
 very
 surprising
 and
 you


know
 that's
 that's
 like
 a
 cliffhanger


because
 you
 have
 to
 you
 have
 to
 continue


to
 listen
 to
 get
 to
 that
 one.


>> Yes.
 Yes.


>> Okay.
 We'll
 leave
 that.
 We'll
 leave


that.
 uh
 in
 the
 meantime


>> but
 but
 I
 will
 say
 that
 you
 know
 in


general
 um
 the
 you
 know
 the
 people
 who


do
 well
 in
 the
 sciences
 um
 usually
 are


doing
 well
 because
 they
 come
 up
 with


something
 that
 nobody
 else
 has
 seen


>> um
 and
 that
 that
 excites
 everybody
 that


that
 you
 know
 they
 all
 say
 wow
 you
 know


we
 didn't
 realize
 that
 the
 world
 was


working
 that
 particular
 way
 um
 and


that's
 really
 important
 to
 know
 and


that's
 where
 the
 excitement
 is
 not


somebody
 usually
 um
 it's
 not
 somebody


who
 was
 just
 showing
 more
 of
 the
 same
 of


what
 people
 already
 thought


>> why
 do
 we
 find
 uncertainty
 so
 hard.


>> I
 think
 that
 we
 have
 a
 a
 very
 lovehate


relationship
 with
 uncertainty,
 right?


Because
 uh
 in
 some
 sense
 it's
 what


people
 love
 about
 so
 much
 so
 many
 games


and
 so
 many
 uh
 things
 that
 they
 that


they're
 going
 to
 do
 for
 fun.
 They
 they


love
 that
 sense
 that
 it
 could
 go
 this


way,
 it
 could
 go
 that
 way.
 Um
 nobody


would
 would
 really
 want
 to,
 you
 know,


play
 a
 sports
 where
 every
 single
 time


you
 knew
 exactly
 how
 it
 was
 all
 going to


come
 out.
 um
 that
 you
 en
 everybody


enjoys
 that
 sense
 that
 something
 a


little
 bit
 surprising
 could
 happen
 here


and
 they
 look
 for
 that
 surprising
 thing


to
 to
 occur.
 But
 we
 also
 are
 very
 easily


scared.
 I
 mean
 it's
 very
 easy
 I
 think


for
 us
 to
 feel
 like
 if
 we
 don't
 know


that
 we're
 going
 to,
 you
 know,
 get
 to


the
 next
 stage
 exactly
 the
 way


everything
 is.
 Who
 knows?
 It
 could
 be


bad.
 It
 could
 be
 that
 we
 wouldn't
 have


enough
 to
 eat.
 Could
 be
 that
 we
 don't,


you
 know,
 have
 a
 place
 to
 sleep.
 And
 and


I
 think
 that
 that
 is
 probably
 an


evolutionary
 uh
 you
 know
 deep
 down
 uh


you
 know
 advantage
 um
 that
 if
 you
 if
 you


are
 always
 being
 careful
 that
 you're
 not


going
 to
 lose
 the
 fundamentals
 that
 that


you
 need
 to
 live
 then
 probably
 you'll


look
 out
 to
 you
 know
 what
 do
 your


hunting
 and
 your
 farming
 early
 enough
 so


you'll
 have
 food
 for
 the
 uh
 for
 the
 next


season.
 Um,
 so
 I
 can
 imagine
 that
 that


could
 have
 been
 a
 very
 useful
 cultural


and
 and
 maybe
 even
 psychological
 thing


to
 evolve,


>> but
 it's
 it's
 has
 to
 be
 balanced.
 You


know,
 you
 you
 need
 uh
 to
 be
 u
 not
 driven


by
 fear
 to
 the
 point
 that
 you
 don't
 step


out
 of
 your
 cave
 and
 and
 out
 of
 your


house
 and
 you
 don't
 try
 out
 ideas.
 Um


because
 if
 you
 just
 just
 use
 the
 old


ideas,
 the
 world
 changes.
 And
 the
 old


ideas
 don't
 necessarily
 track
 um
 what
 we


what
 what
 the
 world's
 doing.
 And
 they


and
 they're
 not
 even
 the
 best
 ideas.


Often
 they're
 they
 were
 good
 enough


models
 of
 what
 was
 going
 on
 at
 the


moment
 when
 somebody
 came
 up
 with
 them.


But


>> there
 could
 be
 much
 better
 ways
 of


understanding
 the
 world.
 And
 that
 is


really
 what
 you
 want.
 You
 don't
 you


don't
 want
 to
 miss
 those.
 And
 sometimes


you
 need
 them


>> in
 in
 um
 I
 did
 a
 a
 degree
 in
 social


psychology
 and
 I
 did
 my
 dissertation
 on


on
 gut
 feel
 in
 investing.
 Well,
 I
 mean


gut
 feel,
 nobody
 believes
 in
 gut
 field,


but
 we
 call
 it
 pattern
 recognition.
 They


always
 say
 they
 believe
 in
 it.
 Is
 there


a
 room
 for
 pattern
 recognition
 in


science?


>> Oh,
 or
 gut
 feel.


>> Oh,
 absolutely.
 Right.
 Because
 we
 we


know
 that
 that
 our
 brains
 are
 doing
 a
 a


very
 interesting
 combination
 of
 work


when
 they're
 trying
 to
 understand
 what's


going
 on
 out
 in
 the
 world.
 Um,
 some
 of


it
 is
 the
 logical
 stuff
 that
 we're
 very


conscious
 of
 that
 we're
 very
 aware
 that,


you
 know,
 okay,
 I've
 just
 seen
 this
 and


I've
 seen
 that.
 So
 I'm
 putting
 them


together
 and
 I'm
 betting
 that
 probably


that
 means
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 this
 aspect


of
 of
 the
 world
 must
 be
 the
 case.
 But


some
 of
 it
 you
 you're
 really
 puzzled.


You
 don't
 see
 how
 is
 it
 possible
 that


this
 thing
 and
 this
 thing
 turned
 into


this
 thing
 and
 people
 work
 on
 it
 and


work
 on
 it
 work
 on
 it
 and
 then
 some
 days


they
 go
 to
 sleep
 and
 they
 wake
 up
 in
 the


morning
 they
 think
 hey
 I
 think
 I
 know


how
 that
 works.
 And
 we
 we
 think
 and
 this


is
 some
 evidence
 that
 uh
 that
 the


unconscious
 mind
 also
 has
 part
 the
 it


gives
 us
 other
 ways
 of
 solving
 problems


maybe
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 like
 the
 way
 uh


these
 neural
 networks
 do
 in
 you
 where


you
 don't
 you
 can't
 really
 track
 down


exactly
 which
 thing
 was
 the
 source
 of


the
 pattern
 recognition
 but
 in
 fact
 it


does
 a
 very
 good
 job
 of
 figuring
 out


patterns
 that
 we
 otherwise
 wouldn't


catch.
 I
 I
 I
 often
 think
 that
 it's
 it's


really
 good
 to
 try
 to
 play
 these
 two


against
 each
 other.
 So
 um
 you
 you


because
 some
 of
 the
 pattern
 recognition


is
 wrong
 that
 we
 just
 we
 recognize


things
 that
 we
 think
 we
 see
 a
 pattern


and
 it's
 not
 really
 true.
 So
 we
 use
 our


very
 thoughtful
 rational
 mind
 to
 go
 back


and
 analyze
 and
 and
 use
 things
 like


statistics
 to
 tell
 whether
 that
 pattern


could
 have
 come
 appeared
 just
 from


random
 noise
 um
 and
 that
 the
 the


randomness
 looked
 to
 us
 like
 a
 pattern.


Um
 so
 that's
 very
 um
 useful
 to
 apply


your
 rational
 mind
 to
 your
 you
 know
 your


logical
 rational
 mind
 to
 the
 pattern


recognition
 side
 of
 the
 mind
 to
 to
 weed


out
 the
 good
 from
 the
 bad
 parts
 of
 what


you've
 come
 up
 with.
 But
 also
 the
 other


way
 around,
 sometimes
 you
 need
 to
 feed


the
 um
 the
 uh
 the
 pattern
 recognition


mind
 by
 focusing
 uh
 the
 the
 rational


mind
 for
 a
 long
 time
 on
 a
 problem
 and


eventually
 that
 it
 seems
 to
 force
 the
 uh


the
 pattern
 finder
 to
 go
 working
 while


you're
 sleeping.


>> Yeah.
 Interesting.
 Uh
 we
 uh
 did
 a


podcast
 with
 Magnus
 Carson,
 the
 chess


player.


>> Yes.
 And
 so
 he
 uses
 his
 um
 kind
 of
 gut


feel
 to
 choose
 for
 instance
 three


different
 potential
 moves
 and
 then
 he


then
 analyze
 them
 properly.


>> Ah
 that's
 that's
 very
 similar
 in
 that


>> absolutely
 absolutely


>> now
 he
 thinks
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 spending


more
 than
 10
 minutes
 on
 analyzing
 is


more
 than
 that
 doesn't
 really
 add
 a
 lot


uh
 which
 is
 interesting.
 Now
 that's
 then


that's
 probably


>> but
 then
 he's
 very
 quick,


>> right?
 I
 was gonna
 say
 it
 probably
 gives


you
 a
 sense
 of
 exactly
 where
 his
 where


his
 depth
 level
 is
 for
 his
 analysis
 that


you
 know
 at
 that
 point
 he
 realizes
 he's


no
 longer
 adding
 uh
 adding
 enough


information.
 Yeah.


>> How
 do
 you
 teach
 this?
 How
 do
 you
 teach


critical
 thinking?


>> We
 were
 not
 really
 sure
 how
 teachable
 it


was
 when
 we
 began
 all
 this.
 So
 um
 there


was
 a
 group
 of
 u
 well
 three
 faculty.
 I


had
 a
 there
 was
 a
 social
 psychologist
 in


the
 public
 policy
 school.
 That
 was
 Rob


McCun
 and
 then
 there
 was
 a
 philosopher


John
 Campbell
 and
 the
 three
 of
 us
 um


started
 meeting
 um
 we
 we
 put
 a
 sign
 up


saying
 uh
 are
 you
 uh
 are
 you
 embarrassed


watching
 our
 society
 make
 decisions?


Come
 help
 invent
 a
 course,
 come
 help


save
 the
 world
 and
 about
 30
 students,


graduate
 students,
 posttos
 started


showing
 up
 um
 every
 week
 at
 the
 end
 of
 a


Friday
 and
 we


>> So
 this
 was
 how
 you
 spent
 Friday
 nights?


>> It
 practically
 was
 it
 was
 for
 how
 long?


It
 was
 Friday
 afternoons
 uh
 and
 and


often
 went
 past
 dinner.
 Um
 and
 and
 this


went
 on
 for
 like
 like
 nine
 months
 uh


that
 we
 were
 meeting
 and
 what
 we
 were


doing
 is
 we
 we
 were
 walking
 through
 what


would
 be
 like
 a
 whole
 collection
 of


ideas
 where
 if
 you
 had
 all
 those
 ideas


clearly
 enough
 um
 it
 would
 help
 you


think
 about
 problems
 in
 the
 world
 and


then
 for
 each
 of
 them
 we
 started
 asking


how
 could
 you
 teach
 that
 idea?
 Is
 there


a
 way
 that
 you
 could
 get
 it
 across
 so


that
 it
 wasn't
 just
 for
 one
 topic
 that


you
 taught
 it,
 but
 anytime
 you
 read
 a


newspaper
 article
 or
 anytime
 you
 walked


down
 the
 street
 and
 you
 had
 to
 make
 a


choice,
 um
 you
 would
 find
 yourself
 using


the
 ideas
 and
 often
 that
 meant
 that
 we


came
 up
 with
 like
 activities
 and
 games


and
 and
 uh
 sometimes
 just
 good


discussion
 questions
 and
 that
 mixture
 um


is
 actually
 the
 way
 we
 end
 up
 teaching


the
 course
 and
 I
 and
 I
 think
 it
 ended
 up


uh
 it
 ended
 up
 being
 both
 fun
 but
 I


think
 also
 a
 little
 bit
 effective.
 They


copied
 that
 course
 in
 other
 universities


as
 well.
 Right.


>> Exactly.
 So
 now
 it's
 starting
 to
 spread


to
 other
 universities.
 We
 began
 it
 at


Berkeley.
 It's
 now
 been
 taught
 uh
 at


Harvard
 and
 University
 of
 Chicago
 and


Irvine.
 I
 think
 now
 Colombia
 is
 picking


it
 up.


>> True
 to
 be
 mandatory
 across
 the
 world.


>> I
 think
 that
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


people
 have
 it's
 one
 of the
 secret


ingredients
 of
 what
 science
 really


consists
 of
 that
 I
 think
 could
 help


everybody.
 And
 so
 I


>> because
 because
 the
 world
 is
 more


uncertain
 than
 it's
 ever
 been.
 Right.
 So


you
 need
 more
 structure
 and
 vigor.


>> Exactly.
 And
 and
 I
 think
 that
 you
 know


we've
 known
 for
 a
 long
 time
 that


thinking
 tools
 are
 really
 important.


That's
 I
 think
 one
 of the
 reasons
 we


teach
 expository
 writing
 to
 students


everywhere.
 Um
 they're
 not
 all
 planned


to
 be
 writers,
 but
 I
 think
 the
 focus
 of


how
 you
 think
 about
 a
 problem
 when
 you


write
 is
 a
 very
 important
 thinking
 tool.


But
 these
 are
 a
 whole
 set
 of
 other


thinking
 tools
 that
 I
 that
 feel
 like


they're
 very
 important
 in
 this


technological
 scientific
 world.
 um
 and


even
 a
 world
 where
 you
 just
 have
 to
 make


probabilistic
 decisions
 with
 uh
 with


other
 people
 and
 that
 so
 much
 of
 this


has
 to
 do
 with
 how
 you
 can
 think


together
 with
 people
 um
 in
 a
 productive


way
 that
 you
 want
 that
 vocabulary
 of


ideas
 to
 be
 shared
 by
 everybody.
 So
 I


would
 love
 it
 to
 be
 as
 a
 standard
 basic


course
 in
 every
 university.


>> Now
 um
 your
 mother
 was
 a
 professor
 in


social
 work,
 your
 father
 was
 a
 professor


in
 engineering
 and
 you
 are
 married
 to
 an


anthropologist.
 So
 it
 doesn't
 get
 more


cross
 domainish
 than
 that.
 Hey,
 what


what
 did
 disc
 I
 mean
 what
 do
 discussions


look
 like
 at
 your
 you
 know
 uh
 family


dinners?
 Well,
 well,
 I
 remember
 uh
 at


one
 point
 somebody
 was
 asking
 me,
 you


know,
 how
 much
 influence
 was
 there
 of
 of


having
 parents
 in
 these
 in
 these
 areas


and
 I
 was
 thinking,
 well,
 my
 father
 was


obviously
 a
 very
 big
 influence
 just


because
 as
 a
 a
 scientist,
 uh,
 and
 you


know,
 he
 would
 be
 doing
 calculations
 and


I'd,
 you
 know,
 be
 seen
 the
 graphs
 and


the
 and
 the
 calculator
 and
 I
 and
 just


and
 slide
 rules
 back
 in
 those
 days.
 Um


and
 and
 I
 think
 I
 was
 attracted
 to
 the


fact
 that
 you
 can
 learn
 things
 about
 the


world
 um
 that
 are
 very
 precise
 and
 and


and
 organized
 and
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 I
 was


enjoyed
 watching
 and
 and
 I
 was
 attracted


to
 that.
 But
 at
 the
 same
 time
 I
 realized


that
 I
 think
 probably
 just
 as


influential
 uh
 was
 watching
 my
 mother


who
 was
 a
 social
 professor.
 She
 studied


public
 policy
 and
 public
 administration.


Um
 and
 and
 then
 in
 her
 case,
 the
 work


was
 often
 done
 in
 larger
 collaborations


and
 just
 watching
 how
 she
 would
 work


with
 a
 collab
 with
 collaborators.
 Um
 I


think
 was
 was
 a
 whole
 different


education
 and
 and
 it
 was
 a
 real
 pleasure


to
 see
 groups
 of
 people
 who
 really


enjoyed
 figuring
 out
 problems
 together


and
 thinking
 together.
 And
 I
 think
 that


was
 one
 of the
 things
 that
 was
 as


important
 for
 me
 growing
 up
 as
 watching


my
 my
 father
 as
 a
 scientist.
 M


>> how
 does
 AI
 inhibit
 critical
 thinking
 or


does
 it?
 I
 think
 of
 it
 as
 a
 as
 a
 two


two-edged.
 I
 mean
 that
 it
 can
 do
 both


and
 I
 mean
 much
 like
 you
 know
 we
 I
 think


we
 might
 have
 felt
 that
 way
 about


calculators
 you
 know
 originally
 that
 we


weren't
 sure
 should
 every
 every
 student


be
 using
 calculators
 because
 shouldn't


they
 know
 how
 to
 do
 multiplication
 and


you
 know
 division
 and
 and
 and
 in
 fact
 we


still
 teach
 how
 to
 do
 additions,


subtraction,
 multiplication,
 division
 um


first
 but
 then
 we
 we
 send
 them
 loose


with
 the
 calculators.


The
 tricky
 thing
 about
 AI
 is
 that
 it
 can


give
 the
 impression
 that
 you've
 actually


learned
 the
 basics
 before
 you
 really


have
 and
 that
 there's
 a
 little
 danger
 I


think
 that
 students
 may
 find
 themselves


just
 relying
 on
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 too
 soon


before
 they
 know
 how
 to
 do
 the
 the
 the


work
 themselves,
 the
 intellectual
 work


themselves.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 the


danger.
 Now,
 the
 positive
 is
 that
 when


you
 know
 all
 these
 different
 tools
 and


and
 approaches
 to
 how
 to
 think
 about
 a


problem,
 AI
 can
 often
 help
 you
 find
 the


bit
 of
 information
 that
 you
 need
 um
 to


use
 these
 techniques
 that
 we're


teaching.
 Um
 and
 uh
 and
 so
 I
 think
 you


know
 ideally
 what
 I'm
 what
 I've
 been


asking
 in
 this
 this
 round
 as
 we're


teaching
 the
 uh
 this
 set
 of
 we
 have
 like


you
 know
 24
 concepts
 that
 we're
 trying


to
 teach
 in
 this
 critical
 thinking


course
 that
 for
 each
 one
 of
 them
 I'm


asking
 the
 students
 to
 think
 very
 hard


about
 how
 would
 you
 use
 AI
 to
 make
 it


easier
 to
 actually
 operationalize
 this


concept
 to
 really
 use
 it
 in
 your


day-to-day
 life


>> but
 also
 how
 would
 you
 use
 this
 concept


to
 tell
 whether
 or
 not
 AI
 was
 fooling


you
 and
 whether
 the
 AI
 was
 was
 was


putting
 sending
 you
 in
 the
 right


direction
 or
 the
 wrong


because
 many
 of
 them
 are
 just
 tools
 for


thinking
 about
 where
 are
 we
 getting


where
 are
 we
 getting
 fooled
 um
 and
 we


can
 be
 fooling
 ourselves
 the
 AI
 could
 be


fooling
 itself
 and
 and
 then
 could
 fool


us
 and
 as
 we
 know
 at least
 the
 current


generation
 of
 AI
 is
 very
 good
 at
 being


overly
 confident
 about
 uh
 about
 what


it's
 saying
 uh
 to
 telling
 you
 and
 then


you
 believe
 oh
 well
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's


typed
 right
 there
 right
 in
 the
 screen
 it


must
 be
 right
 um
 and
 yet
 you
 need
 to


have
 that
 same
 sense
 of
 of
 gauge
 of
 of


how
 much
 do
 you
 trust
 this
 result
 as
 you


would
 when
 you're
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


how
 much
 do
 I
 trust
 a
 statement
 I'm


making
 or
 a
 statement
 that
 somebody
 else


is
 making.


>> And
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 the
 game
 that
 you


have
 to
 play
 um
 at least
 with
 the


current
 version
 of
 AI.
 Um
 now
 of
 course


AI
 will
 be
 changing
 and
 we'll
 have
 to


keep
 we
 are
 constantly
 having
 to
 keep


asking
 ourselves
 is
 it
 helping
 us
 or
 are


we
 getting
 fooled
 more
 often?
 Are
 we


letting
 ourselves
 get
 fooled?


>> So
 should
 we
 move
 out
 into
 space?


>> Glad
 to.


>> Is
 that
 where
 you
 enjoy
 living?
 So,
 I've


I've
 been
 uh
 I've
 been
 really
 liking


this
 the
 fact
 that
 um
 as
 a
 cosmologist,


you
 get
 to
 you
 get
 to
 be
 in
 this
 really


interesting
 place
 because
 you're
 you're


using
 uh
 our
 understanding
 of
 the
 very


smallest
 elementary
 particles
 and
 forces


to
 understand
 the
 biggest
 largest


structures
 um
 in
 the
 universe.
 And
 so


you
 get
 to
 be
 sort
 of
 nestled
 right
 in


the
 middle
 of
 scale
 while
 you
 look
 out


at
 things
 that
 are
 tremendously
 larger


than
 us
 and
 look
 down
 into
 into
 things


that
 are
 tremendously
 smaller
 than
 us


and
 and
 we're
 in
 that
 nice
 sort
 of


middle
 place
 that
 we
 get
 we
 get
 to
 look


at
 both.


>> Stupid
 question.
 What's
 the
 difference


between
 a
 cosmo
 cosmopologist
 and
 an


astrophysicist?


>> So
 the
 astrophysicists
 um
 are
 generally


studying
 the
 physics
 and
 and
 or
 of
 of


almost
 anything
 that
 you
 see
 in
 in
 the


sky.
 Um
 and
 uh
 whereas
 the
 cosmologists


are
 are
 specifically
 asking
 the
 question


of
 um
 what
 was
 the
 evolutionary
 order?


What
 how
 did
 things
 uh
 come
 about
 in


this
 order
 from
 here
 to
 here
 to
 here


that
 led
 to
 where
 we
 are
 today?


>> And
 you
 study
 both.


>> I
 do
 both.


>> When
 you
 look
 at
 when
 you
 think
 about
 um


space,
 how
 do
 you
 visualize
 it?
 If
 you


close
 your
 eyes,
 just
 what
 does
 it
 look


like?
 I
 think
 that
 for
 me
 I've
 been
 very


interested
 in
 this
 the
 fact
 that


Einstein's
 theory
 of
 relativity
 allows


for
 a
 for
 three-dimensional
 space
 to


possibly
 have
 a
 weird
 curvature
 to
 it.


And
 this
 isn't
 something
 that
 our


brains,
 you
 know,
 are
 evolved
 to
 to


picture
 at
 all.
 And
 so
 you
 constantly


are
 having
 to
 s
 force
 yourself
 to


imagine
 that
 there's
 what
 looks
 like


infinite
 space.
 You're
 traveling
 as
 far


as
 you
 want
 some
 direction,
 but
 it's


possible
 that
 there's
 curvature
 in
 it.


You'll
 find
 yourself
 back
 somewhere


where
 you
 were
 before
 if
 you
 just
 keep


going
 in
 that
 direction.
 And
 and
 and
 I


think
 I
 always
 have
 loved
 um
 boggling
 my


own
 brain.
 I
 like
 I
 like
 that
 feeling
 of


not
 quite
 getting
 something
 but
 almost


being
 able
 to
 picture
 it.
 And
 I
 think


that
 for
 me
 that's
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 of
 a
 of
 a


odd
 pleasure,
 you
 know.
 So
 when
 you


picture
 it,
 is
 it
 like
 black
 with
 with


you
 like
 the
 planets
 being,
 you
 know,


lights
 and
 suns
 or
 just
 how
 does
 it
 what


does
 it
 look
 like?
 I
 mean
 in
 in
 some


sense
 the
 current
 uh
 universe
 to
 me


seems
 like
 it's
 almost
 entirely
 empty


and
 every
 now
 and
 then
 um
 in
 this
 huge


empty
 uh
 void
 um
 you
 see
 a
 little
 dot


and
 if
 you
 go
 close
 up
 to
 it
 you
 realize


that
 that
 dot
 is
 actually
 a
 whole
 pin


wheel
 of
 a
 galaxy
 um
 with
 a
 hundred


billion
 little
 points
 of
 light
 of
 stars


in
 them
 and
 then
 you
 go
 wishing
 by
 it


and
 you
 then
 it
 disappears
 into
 the


background
 and
 goes
 back
 to
 being
 this


little
 dot
 and
 then
 eventually
 you
 see


another
 dot
 showing
 up
 way
 out
 there
 in


the
 future
 in
 in
 in
 the
 horizon
 and
 you


and
 you
 get
 closer
 and
 closer
 and
 you


start
 realizing
 oh
 it's
 another
 galaxy


and
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 for
 my
 picture
 of


the
 current
 uh
 universe.
 Now,
 if
 you
 go


way
 way
 back
 in
 time,
 um
 the
 universe
 we


think
 was
 um
 the
 space
 was
 sucked
 out


between
 all
 these
 galaxies
 and
 they
 were


closer
 and
 closer
 and
 closer
 until


everything
 was
 on
 top
 of
 each
 other
 and


then
 eventually
 all
 the
 material
 was
 on


top
 of
 each
 other
 and
 eventually
 you
 get


to
 the
 point
 where
 it
 was
 this


>> possibly
 infinite
 soup
 of
 of
 elementary


particles
 that
 are
 hot
 and
 dense
 and
 uh


and
 during
 that
 period
 um
 it's
 it's
 like


a
 a
 very
 thick
 uh
 almost
 like
 a
 pea
 soup


because
 it
 has
 little
 clumps
 where
 where


the
 galaxies
 someday
 eventually
 form
 and


slightly
 emptier
 spots
 but
 it's
 you
 know


basically
 a
 non-stop
 plasma
 of
 these
 of


these


elementary
 particles.
 So
 those
 are
 those


are
 the
 two
 different
 extremes
 of
 of


time.


>> But
 of
 course
 a
 naive
 kind
 of
 question


is
 something
 how
 can
 something
 which
 is


already
 in
 infinite
 expand
 further.
 How


you


>> I
 mean
 that's
 one
 of the
 the
 biggest


standard
 mindbggling
 questions
 that
 um


everybody
 uh
 comes
 to
 and
 and
 you
 know
 I


certainly
 have
 come
 to
 it
 over
 and
 over


again.
 Um
 when
 you
 hear
 the
 words
 the


universe
 expands
 um
 that's
 the
 first


thing
 that
 comes
 to
 mind.
 Wait
 the


universe
 is
 everything.
 How
 could
 it


expand?
 And
 the
 only
 answer
 that
 that


seems
 to
 make
 any
 sense
 is
 you
 have
 to


picture
 even
 an
 infinite
 universe
 um
 and


you
 ask
 yourself
 okay
 um
 today
 as
 I
 said


there's
 galaxy
 and
 then
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


space
 and
 there's
 another
 galaxy
 and


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 space
 in
 another
 galaxy


and
 in
 an
 infinite
 universe
 um
 that's


expanding
 all
 those
 distances
 just
 get
 a


little
 bit
 f
 further
 apart.
 So
 it
 we're


it's
 not
 expanding
 into
 anything
 else.


It's
 that
 we're
 adding
 extra
 space


between
 all
 points.
 So,
 it's
 almost
 like


inflating
 it
 from
 the
 inside.
 Um,
 that


we're
 we're
 just
 putting
 more
 and
 more


space
 between
 any
 two
 between
 me
 and
 you


and
 between
 this
 galaxy
 and
 the
 next


galaxy
 and
 the
 and
 the
 further
 galaxies


everywhere.
 We're
 just
 adding
 a
 little


bit
 extra
 space
 and
 it's
 slightly
 bigger


um
 because
 of
 that.
 And
 uh
 it's
 still


infinite.
 Um
 it's
 just
 now
 there's
 more


space
 between
 all
 the
 points.


>> If
 Ellen
 Musk
 asked
 you
 to
 go
 to
 Mars,


would
 you
 go?
 I'm
 somebody
 who
 um
 loves


the
 fact
 that
 there
 are
 people
 who
 would


like
 to
 go
 to
 Mars,
 but
 I
 would
 never
 go


and
 because
 I
 because
 there's
 so
 many


things
 I
 enjoy
 doing
 that
 I'm
 I
 and
 I


enjoy
 coming
 across
 and
 getting
 to


explore
 with
 people
 that
 I
 would
 hate
 to


give
 all
 that
 up
 just
 for
 this
 one
 thing


uh
 you
 know
 the
 the
 one
 exploration
 of


that
 of
 that
 of
 just
 going
 to
 Mars.
 Uh


but
 especially
 because
 you
 don't
 get
 to


know
 that
 you
 got
 to
 go
 back,
 you
 know,


no,


right?
 I
 mean,
 if
 they
 promised,


>> you
 have
 to
 assume
 there
 was
 a
 drone


ticket
 there,


>> right?
 Right.
 Right.
 If
 you
 promised


that
 you
 could
 you
 that
 you
 could


certainly
 get
 back
 and
 you'
 be
 and
 you'd


be
 happy
 and
 healthy
 and
 you
 get
 to
 do


all
 the
 other
 explorations,
 then


absolutely
 I
 would
 go
 to
 Mars.
 You
 know,


>> given
 the
 big
 bang
 happened
 so
 long
 ago,


why
 does
 it
 accelerate
 now?


>> So,
 the
 original
 picture
 um
 that
 we
 had


started
 with
 when
 we
 were
 doing
 the


measurements
 that
 that
 uh
 that
 we
 were


talking
 about
 that
 led
 to
 our
 current
 uh


understanding.
 Um
 the
 original
 picture


had
 it
 that
 the
 universe
 begins
 um
 with


a
 very
 rapid
 expansion
 that
 we
 can


explain
 where
 we
 think
 it
 comes
 from
 but


then
 has
 been
 slowing
 down
 ever
 since


because
 gravity
 will
 attract
 everything


else.
 And
 then
 if
 that
 were
 the
 case


then
 the
 only
 thing
 that
 we
 really
 need


to
 know
 about
 to
 to
 figure
 out
 the


future
 is
 to
 measure
 how
 much
 it's


slowing
 down
 because
 that
 tells
 us
 how


dense
 the
 universe
 is
 and
 that's


gravitationally
 slowing
 the
 expansion.


So
 that's
 what
 we
 thought
 we
 were
 um


setting
 out
 to
 measure
 back
 when
 we


started
 that
 project.
 Oh,
 25
 no
 30
 some


odd
 years
 ago.
 Um
 and
 then
 when
 we
 made


when
 we
 actually
 finally
 got
 to
 the


point
 that
 we
 could
 make
 the
 measurement


um
 we
 found
 the
 surprise
 that
 actually


the
 universe
 is
 not
 slowing
 down,
 it's


speeding
 up.
 So
 what
 that
 led
 to
 is
 a


expectation
 that
 there's
 some
 property


um
 perhaps
 of
 empty
 space
 itself.
 But


right
 at
 the
 moment,
 we're
 thinking
 uh


it
 could
 be
 a
 new
 substance,
 a
 new
 field


through
 that's
 spread
 throughout
 space


that
 actually
 powers
 a
 a
 more
 rapid


expansion
 and
 acceleration.
 And
 that's


what
 we're
 calling
 dark
 energy.


>> And
 what
 is
 that?


>> And
 that's
 the
 mystery
 of
 the
 past
 20


years.
 So
 we've
 seen
 uh
 that
 the
 this


acceleration
 is
 happening.
 And
 so
 what


we've
 been
 starting
 to
 do
 for
 the
 past


20
 years
 is
 try
 to
 measure
 um
 properties


of
 that
 acceleration
 to
 see
 if
 we
 can


figure
 out
 what
 is
 what
 that
 dark
 energy


could
 be.
 Um
 there
 there's
 well
 a
 huge


number
 of
 theories.
 I
 think
 there
 was
 a


I
 think
 it
 was
 estimating
 that
 in
 the


last
 20
 years
 25
 years
 there's
 been
 a
 on


average
 a
 new
 um
 theoretical
 paper
 about


the
 dark
 energy
 written
 every
 24
 hours


um
 published
 for
 you
 know
 um
 in
 the
 last


25
 years.
 Um,
 and
 so
 there's
 way
 more


theories
 than
 there
 is
 uh
 than
 there
 are


constraints
 and
 measurements.
 And
 it's


taken
 us
 20
 years
 or
 so
 of
 developing


these
 projects
 to
 the
 point
 that
 we're


just
 now
 um
 about
 to
 be
 entering
 the


next
 5
 years
 or
 10
 years.
 Um
 we'll
 be


making
 all
 the
 measurements
 that
 we
 were


hoping
 to
 make
 for
 20
 years
 ago
 that
 we


we're
 intending
 to
 start
 telling
 apart


what
 could
 be
 the
 stark
 energy.


>> We
 talked
 earlier
 about
 the
 importance


of
 believing
 in
 yourself.
 Now
 you
 spent


three
 years
 without
 any
 breakthroughs
 uh


researching
 uh
 these
 kind
 of
 things


before
 you
 published
 in
 98.
 How
 do
 you


keep
 a
 team
 motivated
 to
 just
 kind
 of
 go


on
 and
 on?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 No,
 it
 was
 worse
 than
 that.


In
 fact,
 um
 we
 started
 the
 project.
 So


the
 n
 the
 98
 result
 started
 in
 80
 87
 was


when
 we
 first
 proposed
 the
 measurement


and
 we
 thought
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be
 a
 hard


project.
 We
 thought
 that
 was
 going
 to


take
 three
 years
 because
 we
 were
 going


to
 need
 30
 of
 these
 exploding
 star


supernova
 to
 make
 the
 measurement
 with.


At
 the
 end
 of
 three
 years,
 we
 had
 zero


supernova,
 not
 30.
 Um,
 and
 it
 was
 only


after
 five
 years
 that
 we
 had
 um
 really


de
 excellent
 first
 one
 that
 was
 well


measured.
 And
 then
 but
 by
 then
 we'd


learned
 how
 to
 make
 the
 um
 how
 to
 make


batches
 of
 of
 these
 measurements.
 And
 so


for
 the
 next
 three
 years,
 we
 collected
 a


dozen
 or
 or
 more
 a
 year
 until
 we
 finally


had
 the
 numbers
 that
 we
 needed
 to
 to to


get
 the
 answer.
 And
 when
 you
 have
 one
 of


these,
 how
 long
 time
 do
 you
 have
 to


measure
 it
 and
 to


>> Oh,
 the
 well
 the
 these
 exploding
 stars,


the
 supernova,
 they're
 they're
 amazing


tools
 because
 you
 can
 see
 them
 across


the
 universe
 and
 they
 and
 the
 the
 kind


that
 we're
 using
 is
 all
 the
 same


brightness
 and
 they
 make
 a
 great


measuring
 tool,
 but
 they're
 a
 terrible


thing
 to
 work
 with
 because
 um
 they
 don't


let
 no
 warning
 about
 when
 they're
 going


to
 explode
 in
 any
 galaxy
 uh
 around.
 They


only
 explode
 every
 few
 hundred
 thou
 a


few
 hundred
 years
 um
 in
 any
 given
 galaxy


that
 you're
 that
 you're
 looking
 at.
 Um


and
 uh
 and
 they
 rise
 in
 just
 a
 couple


weeks
 and
 they
 fade
 away
 within,
 you


know,
 a
 month
 or
 so.
 And
 so,
 and
 you


have
 to
 catch
 them
 during
 that
 rise.
 So,


you
 can
 measure
 them
 at
 their
 peak


brightness.
 And
 uh
 and
 so
 they're
 the


the
 most
 annoying
 research
 tool
 that
 you


can
 imagine.
 And
 that's
 why
 it
 took
 so


long
 for
 us
 to
 get
 to
 the
 point
 of


knowing
 how
 to
 work
 with
 them
 as
 a
 as
 a


very
 standard
 uh
 tool
 where
 we
 could


turn
 out
 many
 of
 them
 all
 all
 the
 time


and
 and
 study
 them.
 Because
 we
 talked


about
 because
 we
 briefly
 talked
 about


this
 when
 we
 when
 we
 discussed
 the


importance
 of
 having
 a
 backup
 uh
 you


know
 for
 these
 books
 and
 you
 said
 well


you
 knew
 when
 you
 when
 you
 look
 at
 these


you
 know
 these
 explosions
 you
 better


have
 film
 in
 your
 camera
 right
 because


>> exactly
 and
 we
 used
 to
 do
 uh
 you
 know


all
 sorts
 of
 things
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we


were
 that
 we
 would
 be
 that
 you
 know
 on


those
 rare
 nights
 that
 we
 happen
 to
 be


there
 at
 the
 telescope
 and
 there
 was
 a


supernova
 that
 everything
 was
 going
 to


work
 and
 we
 had
 teams
 of
 people
 flying


out
 you
 know
 from
 one
 part
 of
 the
 world


to
 another
 because
 that's
 where
 the


telescopes
 were
 at
 that
 time
 that
 we
 had


to
 fly
 to
 and
 we
 had
 teams
 of
 people


back
 at
 the
 lab
 who
 were
 collecting
 the


data
 from
 the
 parts
 different
 parts
 of


the
 world
 and
 giving
 instructions
 for


what
 they
 were
 seeing
 and
 what
 they


recommended.
 Um
 so
 it
 was
 it
 was
 a
 bit


of a
 show
 uh
 during
 during
 that
 period.


>> Talking
 about
 show
 I
 mean
 you
 and
 you


raced
 against
 another
 team
 right?


>> That's
 right.
 So
 how
 did
 that
 uh
 impact


the
 process?


>> It
 well
 at
 the
 beginning
 we
 we
 were
 it


was
 funny
 because
 in
 the
 early
 days
 um


we
 were
 trying
 to
 say
 this
 is
 a
 great


project.
 everybody
 should
 be
 doing
 this.


And
 then
 pretty
 soon
 another
 team
 was


doing
 it.
 And
 that
 meant
 that
 now
 we


were
 in
 a
 bit
 of a
 race
 because
 um
 there


were
 only
 a
 few
 telescopes
 in
 the
 world


that
 had
 the
 capabilities
 of
 doing
 what


we
 wanted.
 And
 we
 were
 now
 both
 applying


to
 use
 the
 same
 telescopes.
 In
 fact,
 we


would
 sometimes
 pass
 each
 other
 in
 the


airports
 going
 to
 these
 telescopes.
 Um


and
 so
 it
 was
 a
 very
 toughly
 fought
 uh


uh
 you
 know
 race.


>> Were
 you
 were
 you
 friendly
 with
 them?
 I


mean
 did
 you
 say
 hi
 when
 you
 passed
 them


at
 the
 airport?


>> Well
 well
 yes.
 Um
 but
 there
 there
 was


you
 know
 some
 parts
 of
 it
 that
 were
 very


conflictual
 and
 very
 you
 know
 people


give
 each
 other
 a
 very
 hard
 time
 at
 the


conferences.
 Um
 um
 but
 the
 for
 example


the
 other
 leader
 of
 the
 other
 team
 and


myself
 we
 would
 commiserate
 with
 each


other
 about
 how
 difficult
 it
 was
 to
 keep


our
 whole
 teams
 working
 uh
 effectively


um
 you
 know
 independently
 and
 uh
 and
 we


did
 at
 least
 on
 two
 occasions
 uh
 where


we
 had
 we
 all
 depend
 on
 the
 weather
 when


we're
 doing
 astronomy
 from
 the
 ground.


And
 so
 we,
 you
 know,
 one
 one
 time
 they


uh
 had
 terrible
 weather
 and
 that
 meant


they
 were
 going
 to
 lose
 um
 everything


they've
 been
 working
 for
 for
 that
 that


particular
 sequence
 of
 searching
 and


then
 following.
 And
 so
 we
 took
 some


observations
 for
 them
 um
 so
 they
 could


keep
 going.
 And
 then
 there's
 another


time
 where
 we
 got
 bad
 weather
 and
 we


traded
 times,
 we
 traded
 nights
 with
 uh


with
 my
 uh
 counterpart,
 the
 leader
 of


the
 other
 team.
 Um
 so
 they
 could
 help
 us


be
 able
 to
 stay
 on
 our
 uh
 trajectory
 of


of
 how
 many
 nights
 we
 had
 to
 keep


observing.


>> And
 then
 you
 and
 then
 you
 share
 the


prize


>> and
 then
 and
 then
 at
 the
 end
 the
 two


teams
 came
 up
 with
 the
 same
 result
 um


and
 announced
 it
 within
 weeks
 of
 each


other.
 and
 and
 so
 in
 the
 end
 it
 was


accepted
 as
 a
 a
 joint
 discovery
 and
 so


uh
 the
 two
 the
 two
 teams
 shared
 the


prize.


>> It's
 kind
 of
 beautiful.
 No,


>> I
 think
 I
 mean
 in
 some
 sense
 at
 the


time,
 you
 know,
 everybody
 was
 saying
 to


me,
 "Oh,
 you've
 got
 to
 you
 know,
 get
 you


get
 yours
 out,
 you
 know,
 for
 first


because
 otherwise
 you're
 going
 to
 have


to
 share
 the
 prize
 and
 etc."
 And
 I
 and
 I


was
 thinking,
 but
 in
 the
 end,
 you
 know,


it
 was
 a
 relatively
 small
 community
 of


people
 who
 were
 doing
 this
 kind
 of
 work


and
 we
 were
 all
 dependent
 on
 each
 other


in
 some
 sense
 for
 different
 things
 that


we
 were
 contributing.
 And
 so
 it
 was
 the


right
 it
 it
 was
 a
 very
 warm
 outcome
 in


the
 end
 because
 it
 felt
 like
 it
 honored


a
 big
 fraction
 of
 the
 community
 got


honored
 by
 the
 by
 these
 two
 teams.


>> S
 is
 there
 an
 objective
 truth?


>> I
 think
 that
 the
 way
 science
 has
 been


able
 to
 make
 all
 of
 its
 progress
 is
 by


taking
 very
 seriously
 the
 idea
 that


there
 is
 a
 world
 out
 there
 that
 is
 the


thing
 that
 we're
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


and
 that
 we
 don't
 get
 direct
 access
 to


it.
 We
 get
 to
 see
 what
 we
 can
 see


through
 our
 eyes,
 through
 our


instruments,
 and
 through
 our
 tools
 and


our
 measurements.
 And
 we
 build
 up
 our


models
 of
 what
 that
 ex
 what
 that


objective
 truth
 is
 of
 the
 world
 out


there.
 Um,
 but
 it's
 going
 to
 do
 its


thing
 whether
 we
 get
 it
 or
 not.
 And
 our


models
 are
 going
 to
 be
 not
 quite
 right.


They'll
 almost
 never
 capture
 everything.


And
 for
 one
 thing,
 they've
 got
 to
 be


simplifications
 just
 for
 our
 brains
 to


understand
 some
 aspect
 of
 the
 world


that's
 out
 there.
 We
 probably
 can't
 get


it
 take
 it
 all
 in
 all
 at
 one
 time.
 So,


we're
 always
 using
 little
 windows,


little
 models
 of
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 out


there.


>> But
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 um
 I
 think
 we
 make


progress
 because
 we
 all
 believe
 that


it's
 there
 no
 matter
 what
 we
 think.
 And


that
 we
 can't
 just
 go
 to
 our
 separate


corners
 of
 the
 room
 and
 say,
 "Okay,
 you


believe
 what
 you
 want
 to
 believe
 and


I'll
 believe
 what
 I
 want
 to
 believe."


And
 you
 know,
 our
 science
 doesn't
 have


to
 agree.
 Um
 in
 the
 science,
 there's
 a


real
 need
 for
 us
 to
 agree
 because
 we


have
 to
 um
 because
 that's
 where
 we


figure
 out
 where
 we're
 making
 our


mistakes.
 And
 it
 improves
 our
 picture
 of


our
 model
 of
 what
 the
 reality
 is
 out


there
 in
 the
 world.


>> And
 so
 the
 objective
 truth
 of
 the
 world


is
 actually
 I
 think
 what
 provides
 the


the
 link
 between
 our
 different
 uh
 our


different
 projects
 that
 gives
 us
 the


chance
 to
 figure
 out
 things
 that
 are


more
 right
 and
 more
 likely
 to
 be
 wrong.


>> Is
 the
 world
 more
 uncertain
 than
 before?


>> Oh,
 it's
 I
 think
 it's
 always
 been


uncertain.
 um
 you
 know
 in
 some
 sense
 I


think
 that's
 the
 human
 condition
 that
 we


that
 we
 grow
 up
 we
 don't
 know
 um
 you


know
 what
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 and
 we


don't
 know what's
 going to
 happen
 to
 us


we
 don't
 know
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 you


around
 us
 um
 and
 in
 some
 ways
 uh
 what


we've
 been
 doing
 through
 civilization
 is


making
 more
 and
 more
 little
 pieces
 of
 it


manageable
 so
 that
 we
 can
 be
 pretty
 sure


that
 those
 we
 can
 control
 um
 and
 but
 you


know
 it
 it's
 always
 going
 to
 throw
 us
 uh


curves
 that
 where
 we
 don't
 know
 um
 you


know
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 and
 our
 job


of
 course
 is
 to
 be
 able
 to
 be
 nimble


enough
 to
 manage
 what
 all
 what
 all
 the


uncertainties
 are
 and
 not
 to
 have
 them


throw
 us
 that
 not
 make
 them
 scare
 us
 but


make
 us
 feel
 like
 that's
 where
 we
 thrive


that's
 what
 we
 live
 on
 we
 live
 on


playing
 managing
 the
 the
 the
 uncertainty


>> what's
 the
 benefit
 of
 being
 of
 youth
 in


science


>> I
 think
 that
 you
 get
 so
 much
 advantage


of
 having
 bringing
 in
 new
 generations


year
 after
 year
 decade
 after
 decade
 um


in
 into
 any
 field,
 any
 topic
 because
 um


there's
 at
 least
 a
 half
 chance
 that
 they


won't
 get
 stuck
 in
 the
 mistakes
 that
 the


previous
 understanding
 made
 and
 they


also
 are
 acting
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 when
 I


said
 that
 it's
 very
 important
 to
 go
 find


the
 people
 you
 disagree
 with
 and
 so
 they


can
 give
 you
 a
 hard
 time.
 It's
 also
 true


that
 there's
 a
 pleasure
 in
 usually
 in


the
 young
 trying
 to
 show
 the
 the
 old
 uh


the
 older
 that
 they
 that
 they
 made
 a


mistake.


>> And
 do
 you
 never
 think
 hey
 who
 are
 you


to
 teach
 me?
 I've
 got
 a
 Nobel
 Prize.
 I'm


a
 superstar
 and
 you're
 just
 a
 youngster


straight
 out
 of
 go,
 you
 know,
 university


>> all
 the
 time.
 Of
 course,
 what
 happens
 is


that
 is
 that
 anytime
 somebody
 gives
 you


a
 hard
 time,
 you
 you
 your
 first
 reaction


is
 to
 say,
 "Oh,
 come
 on."
 You
 know,
 um


first
 of
 all,
 you
 know,
 that
 that
 other


team,
 they
 they
 don't
 know
 what
 they're


talking
 about.
 They're
 giving
 me
 they're


there's,
 you
 know,
 showing
 they're


claiming
 I
 made
 a
 mistake.
 Um
 you
 know,


I'm
 sure
 they
 made
 a
 mistake,
 you
 know,


and
 then
 some
 of
 the
 time
 you
 you
 have


to
 actually
 look
 at
 and
 go,
 you
 know,
 I


think
 maybe
 they
 are
 right.
 Same
 thing


with
 the,
 you
 know,
 fresh,
 you
 know,


young
 Turk
 that
 comes
 into
 the
 thing
 and


they
 they
 say,
 you
 know,
 okay,
 it's
 our


turn.
 We're
 gonna
 we're
 gonna
 take
 over


and
 do
 this
 thing
 and
 and
 you
 think,


"Oh,
 come
 on.
 You
 you
 don't
 know
 how
 to


do
 that."
 And
 of
 course,
 in
 the
 end,


some
 of
 the
 time,
 they
 they're
 the
 right


they're
 the
 right
 ingredient
 that
 you


need
 at
 that
 moment.


>> And
 given
 that,
 what
 is
 uh
 what
 is
 your


advice
 to
 young
 people?
 Oh,
 well
 I
 mean


I
 my
 my
 sense
 is
 that
 if
 you
 can
 at
 all


um
 put
 aside
 all
 of
 the
 scary
 aspects
 of


the
 news
 that
 is
 often
 presented
 to
 you


because
 the
 news
 is
 designed
 to
 be
 scary


because
 I
 think
 that's
 how
 they
 make


they
 get
 get
 you
 to
 watch.
 Um
 and
 if


instead
 you
 can
 say
 we
 have
 always
 lived


in
 a
 complicated
 um
 uncertain
 world
 and


we
 are
 just
 getting
 better
 and
 better
 at


learning
 how
 to
 ride
 on
 it
 and
 and
 work


with
 it
 and
 we
 have
 this
 option


opportunity
 and
 this
 option
 to
 work
 with


other
 people
 to
 make
 a
 world
 that
 we


that
 we
 want
 to
 live
 in.
 I
 think
 this
 is


your
 moment.
 I
 mean,
 as
 as
 a
 a
 young


person
 coming
 in
 this
 generation,
 you


should
 not
 get
 turned
 off
 by
 all
 the


doom
 and
 gloom
 that
 you
 might
 be
 hearing


from
 the
 from
 the
 elders.
 I
 mean,
 you


should
 be
 saying
 those
 are
 the


challenges
 that
 we
 can
 deal
 with.
 We
 now


know
 the
 how
 to
 do
 all
 sorts
 of
 things


that
 are
 on
 the
 scale
 of
 these
 fears
 and


these
 goals.
 Those
 are
 things
 we
 can
 we


can
 manage.
 And
 so,
 you
 should
 jump
 jump


in
 and
 join
 and
 try
 to
 bring
 the
 elders


with
 you.
 I
 mean,
 try
 and
 get
 them
 to
 uh


to
 be
 a
 little
 less
 worried
 but
 a
 little


bit
 more
 constructively
 engaged,
 you


know,
 in
 trying
 to
 think
 of
 how
 are
 we


going
 to
 make
 the
 world
 the
 world
 we


would
 like
 to
 live
 in.


>> Well,
 that's
 a
 perfect
 place
 to
 end.


It's
 always
 been
 a
 privilege
 to
 be


allowed
 to
 interview
 you.
 Big
 thanks.


>> Have
 a
 pleasure.
