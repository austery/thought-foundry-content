Chat
 GPT
 has
 got
 8
 or
 900
 million
 weekly


active
 users.
 And
 if
 you're
 the
 kind
 of


person
 who
 is
 using
 this
 for
 hours
 every


day,
 ask
 yourself
 why
 five
 times
 more


people
 look
 at
 it,
 get
 it,
 know
 what
 it


is,
 have
 an
 account,
 know
 how
 to
 use
 it,


and
 can't
 think
 of
 anything
 to
 do
 with


it
 this
 week
 or
 next
 week.
 The
 term
 AI


is
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 the
 term


technology.
 When
 something's
 been
 around


any
 for
 a
 while,
 it's
 not
 AI
 anymore.
 Is


machine
 learning
 still
 AI?
 I
 don't
 know.


In
 actual
 general
 usage,
 AI
 seems
 to


mean
 new
 stuff.
 And
 AGI
 seems
 new
 scary


stuff.


>> AGI
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 a
 little
 bit
 like


this.
 Like
 either
 it's
 already
 here
 and


it's
 just
 small
 software
 or
 it's
 5
 years


away
 and
 will
 always
 be
 5
 years
 away.
 We


don't
 know
 the
 physical
 limits
 of
 this


technology
 and
 so
 we
 don't
 know
 how
 much


better
 it
 can
 get.
 You've
 got
 Samman


saying
 we've
 got
 PhD
 level
 researchers


right
 now
 and
 Demis
 says
 no
 we
 don't


shut
 up.
 Very
 new,
 very
 very
 big,
 very


very
 exciting
 world
 changing
 things
 tend


to
 lead
 bubbles.
 So
 yeah,
 if
 we're
 not


in
 a
 bubble
 now,
 we
 will
 be.


>> Benedict,
 welcome
 back
 to
 the
 Asenz


podcast.


>> Good
 to
 be
 back.


>> We're
 here
 to
 discuss
 your
 latest


presentation,
 AI
 eats
 the
 world.
 So
 for


those
 who
 haven't
 read
 it
 yet,
 maybe
 we


can
 go
 share
 the
 highlevel
 thesis
 and


and
 maybe
 contextualize
 it
 in
 light
 of


recent
 AI
 presentations,
 I'm
 curious
 how


how
 your
 thinking
 h
 has
 evolved.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 funny.
 One
 of
 the
 slides
 in


the
 debt
 references
 a
 conversation
 where


I
 had
 with
 a
 big
 company
 CMO
 who
 said


we've
 all
 had
 lots
 of
 AI
 presentations


now
 like
 we've
 had
 the
 Google
 one
 and


we've
 had
 the
 Google
 one
 and
 the


Microsoft
 one.
 We've
 had
 the
 Bane
 one


and
 the
 BCG
 one.
 We've
 had
 the
 one
 from


from
 Accenture
 and
 the
 one
 from
 our
 ad


agency.
 Um
 so
 now
 what?
 So


um
 what's
 it's
 it's
 sort
 of
 90
 odd


slides.
 So
 there
 kind
 of
 there's
 a
 bunch


of
 different
 things
 I'm
 trying
 to
 get


at.
 One
 of
 them
 is
 I
 think
 just
 to
 say


well
 if
 this
 is
 a
 platform
 shift
 or
 more


than
 a
 platform
 shift
 how
 do
 platform


shifts
 tend
 to
 work?
 What
 are
 the
 things


that
 we
 tend
 to
 see
 in
 it?
 And
 how
 many


of
 those
 patterns
 can
 we
 see
 being


repeated
 now?
 And
 of
 course
 those
 some


of
 the
 patterns
 that
 come
 out
 of
 that


are
 things
 like
 bubbles
 but
 another


others
 are
 that
 lots
 of
 stuff
 changes


inside
 the
 tech
 industry
 and
 you
 know


there
 are
 winners
 and
 losers
 and
 people


who
 were
 dominant
 end
 up
 becoming


irrelevant
 and
 then
 there
 were
 new


billion
 trillion
 dollar
 companies


created
 but
 then
 there's
 also
 what
 does


this
 mean
 outside
 the
 tech
 industry


because
 if
 we
 think
 back
 over
 the
 last


waves
 of
 platform
 shifts
 there
 were
 some


industries
 where
 this
 changed
 everything


and
 created
 and
 uncreated
 industries
 and


there
 others
 where
 this
 was
 just
 kind
 of


a
 useful
 tool
 like
 so
 you
 know
 if
 you're


in
 the
 newspaper
 business
 that
 had
 a


very
 different
 impact
 the
 last
 30
 years


look
 very
 different
 to
 if
 you
 were
 in


the
 cement
 business
 where
 you
 know
 the


internet
 was
 just
 kind
 of
 useful
 but


didn't
 really
 change
 the
 nature
 of
 your


industry
 very
 much
 and
 so
 what
 I
 tried


to
 do
 is
 give
 people
 a
 sense
 of
 well


what
 is
 it
 that's
 going
 on
 in
 tech
 how


much
 money
 are
 we
 spending
 what
 are
 we


trying
 to
 do
 what
 are
 the
 unanswered


questions
 what
 might
 or
 might
 not
 happen


um
 within
 the
 tech
 industry


But
 then
 outside
 technology,
 how
 does


this
 tend
 to
 play
 out?
 What
 seems
 to
 be


happening
 at
 the
 moment?
 How
 is
 this


manifesting
 into
 tools
 and
 deployment


and
 new
 use
 cases
 and
 new
 behaviors?


And
 then
 as
 we
 kind
 of
 step
 back
 from


all
 of
 this,
 how
 many
 times
 have
 we
 get


again,
 how
 many
 times
 have
 we
 gone


through
 all
 of
 this
 before?
 You
 know,


they
 it's
 funny.
 I
 went
 on
 a
 podcast


this
 summer
 and
 I
 sort
 of
 opening
 line
 I


said
 something
 like,
 well,
 you
 know,
 I'm


a
 centrist.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 as
 big
 a


deal
 as
 the
 internet
 or
 smartphones,
 but


only
 as
 big
 a
 deal
 as
 the
 internet
 or


smartphones.
 And
 there's
 like
 200


YouTube
 commenters
 underneath
 saying,


you
 know,
 this
 more
 and
 he
 doesn't


understand
 how
 big
 this
 is.
 And
 I
 think,


well,


>> it
 was
 kind
 of
 a
 big
 deal.
 It
 was
 kind


of
 a
 big
 deal.


>> Um,
 and
 you
 know,
 I
 sort
 of
 finished
 the


day
 by
 by
 looking
 at
 elevators
 cuz
 I
 I


live
 in
 an
 apartment
 building
 in


Manhattan
 and
 we
 have
 an
 attended


elevator,
 which
 means
 it's
 there's
 a


hand
 there's
 no
 buttons,
 there's
 an


accelerator
 and
 a
 brake
 and
 the
 doorman


gets
 in
 and
 drives
 you
 to
 your
 floor.


this
 street
 car.
 And
 in
 the
 ' 50s,
 Otis


deployed
 automatic
 elevators.
 And
 then


you
 get
 in
 and
 you
 press
 a
 button.
 And


they
 marketed
 it
 by
 saying,
 "Ah,
 it's


got
 electronic
 politeness."


Your
 which
 means
 the
 infrared
 beam.


And
 today
 when
 you
 get
 into
 an
 elevator,


you
 don't
 say,
 "Ah,
 I'm
 using
 an


electronic
 elevator.
 It's
 automatic.


It's
 just
 a
 lift."
 which
 is
 what


happened
 with
 databases
 and
 with
 the
 web


and
 with
 smartphones
 and
 I
 kind
 of
 think


now
 it's
 funny
 I
 did
 I've
 done
 a
 couple


of
 polls
 on
 this
 in
 LinkedIn
 and
 threads


of
 like
 is
 machine
 learning
 still
 AI
 is


AI
 is
 kind
 of
 in
 AI
 is
 the
 word
 the
 term


AI
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 the
 term


technology
 or
 automation
 it
 see
 it
 only


kind
 of
 applies
 when
 something's
 new


once
 something's
 been
 around
 any
 for
 a


while
 it's
 not
 AI
 AI
 anymore
 so
 like


databases
 certainly
 aren't
 AI
 is
 machine


learning
 still
 AI
 Hey.
 Uh,
 I
 don't
 know.


I
 mean,
 and
 there's
 obviously
 there's


like
 an
 academic
 definition
 where
 people


say,
 "This
 guy's
 an
 idiot."
 No,
 of


course
 I'm
 going
 to
 explain
 the


definition
 of
 AI,
 but
 then
 in
 in
 actual


general
 usage,
 AI
 seems
 to
 mean
 new


stuff.


>> Yeah.
 And
 AGI
 seems,
 you
 know,
 like
 new


scary
 stuff.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 funny.
 There's
 I
 was
 thinking


about
 this.
 There's
 an
 old
 theologian's


joke
 that
 um
 the
 problem
 for
 Jews
 is


that
 you
 wait
 and
 wait
 and
 wait
 for
 the


Messiah
 and
 he
 never
 comes.
 And
 the


problem
 for
 Christians
 is
 that
 he
 came


and
 nothing
 happened.
 like
 you
 know
 the


world
 didn't
 change
 like
 there
 is
 still


sin
 you
 know
 like
 like like
 all


practical
 purposes
 nothing
 happened
 and


AGI
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 a
 little
 bit
 like


this
 like
 either
 it's
 already
 here
 and


so
 you've
 got
 Sam
 Alman
 saying
 we've
 got


PhD
 level
 researchers
 right
 now
 and


Demis
 says
 what
 no
 we
 don't
 shut
 it
 and


so
 either
 it's
 already
 here
 and
 it's


just
 more
 software
 or
 it's
 5
 years
 away


and
 will
 always
 be
 5
 years
 away.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It's
 um
 it's
 interesting.


Let's
 compare
 back
 to
 previous
 platform


shifts
 because
 some
 people
 you
 know
 look


at
 you
 know
 something
 like
 the
 internet


and
 say
 hey
 there
 were
 net
 new
 trillion


dollar
 companies
 you
 know
 Facebook
 and


Google
 u
 that
 that
 were
 created
 from
 it


and
 just
 sort
 of
 all
 sorts
 of
 new


emerging
 winners
 whereas
 they
 look
 at


something
 like
 mobile
 and
 say
 hey
 you


know
 there
 were
 big
 companies
 like
 Uber


and
 Snap
 and
 and
 uh
 Instagram
 and


WhatsApp
 but
 these
 were
 you
 know
 these


were
 billion
 dollar
 outcomes
 or
 or
 tens


of
 billion
 dollar
 outcomes
 but
 really


the
 big
 winners
 were
 were
 in
 fact


Facebook
 and
 Google.
 Um,
 and
 and
 so
 in


some
 sense,
 mobile
 perhaps
 was


sustaining.
 Um,
 you
 feel
 free
 to
 quibble


with
 the
 definition
 of,
 you
 know,


sustaining
 disruptive,
 but
 sustaining
 in


the
 sense
 that
 maybe
 more
 of
 the
 value


went
 to
 incumbents
 or
 or
 or
 companies


that
 existed
 prior
 to
 the
 to
 the
 to
 the


shift.
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 curious
 how
 you
 think


about
 AI
 in
 in in
 in
 light
 of
 that
 in


terms
 of
 is
 it
 enabling
 is
 more
 of
 the


gains
 coming
 from
 you
 know
 net
 new
 going


to
 come
 to
 net
 new
 companies
 like
 like


open
 AI
 and
 anthropic
 and
 others
 that


that
 follow
 or
 um
 you
 know
 are
 more
 of


the
 gains
 going
 to
 be
 captured
 by
 you


know
 Microsoft
 and
 and
 and and
 Google


and
 Facebook
 and
 and
 meta
 and
 you
 know


companies
 that
 existed
 prior.


>> So
 I
 think
 it's
 well
 there's
 several


answers
 to
 this.
 One
 of
 them
 is
 like
 you


kind
 of
 have
 to
 be
 careful
 about
 like


framings
 and
 structures
 and
 things


because
 you
 end
 up
 arguing
 about
 the


framing
 and
 the
 definition
 rather
 than


arguing
 about
 what's
 going
 to
 happen.


And
 you
 know
 they're
 all
 useful
 but
 they


all
 they've
 all
 got
 holes
 in
 them.
 And


you
 know
 that
 what
 what
 what
 mobile
 did


was
 it
 kind
 of
 it
 it it
 shifted
 us
 you


know
 there's
 a
 bunch
 of
 things
 that
 it


changed
 fundamentally.
 It
 shifted
 us


from
 the
 web
 to
 apps
 for
 example
 and
 it


gave
 everybody
 on
 the
 world
 a
 a
 phone.


It
 gave
 everybody
 on
 the
 world
 a
 pocket


computer.
 So
 even
 today
 there's
 less


than
 a
 billion
 consumer
 PCs
 on
 earth
 and


there's
 something
 between
 five
 and
 six


billion
 smartphones
 and
 um
 it
 made


possible
 things
 that
 would
 not
 have
 been


possible
 without
 it
 whether
 that's
 Tik


Tok
 or
 arguably
 I
 think
 things
 like


online
 dating
 and
 you
 know
 the the
 you


can
 map
 those
 against
 dollar
 value
 you


can
 also
 map
 those
 against
 kind
 of


structural
 change
 in
 consumer
 behavior


and
 access
 to
 information
 and
 things
 and


I
 think
 you
 could
 certainly
 argue
 that


Meta
 would
 be
 a
 much
 smaller
 company
 if


it
 wasn't
 for
 mobile
 for
 example.
 So
 you


know
 you
 can
 kind
 of
 argue
 the
 puts
 and


calls
 on
 on
 on
 this
 stuff
 a
 lot.
 Um


there
 certainly
 you
 know
 not
 all


platform
 shifts
 are
 the
 same
 and
 you


know
 you
 can
 do
 the
 sort
 of
 standard


sort
 of
 teology
 of
 say
 well
 there
 were


mainframes
 and
 then
 PCs
 and
 then
 the
 web


and
 then
 smartphones
 but
 you
 kind
 of


want
 to
 put
 SAS
 in
 there
 somewhere
 and


you
 kind
 of
 want
 to
 put
 open
 source
 in


there
 and
 maybe
 you
 want
 to
 put


databases
 and
 so
 you
 know
 these
 are
 kind


of
 useful
 framings
 but
 like
 they're
 not


predictive.
 They
 don't
 tell
 you
 what's


going
 to
 happen.
 they
 just
 kind
 of
 give


you
 one
 way
 of
 understanding
 what
 seems


some
 of
 the
 patterns
 that
 that that
 we


have
 here.
 Um
 and
 of
 course
 the
 big


debate
 around
 generative
 AI
 is
 this
 is


is
 just
 another
 platform
 shift
 or
 is
 it


something
 more
 than
 that
 and
 of
 course


the
 problem
 is
 we
 don't
 know
 and
 we


don't
 have
 any
 way
 of
 knowing
 other
 than


waiting
 to
 see.
 So
 this
 may
 be
 as
 big
 as


PCs
 or
 the
 web
 or
 SAS
 or
 or
 open
 source


or
 something
 or
 it
 may
 be
 as
 big
 as


computing
 and
 then
 you
 got
 the
 very


overexited
 people
 living
 in
 group
 houses


in
 Berkeley
 who
 think
 you
 know
 this
 is


as
 big
 as
 fire
 or
 something.
 Well,
 well,


great.
 Um,
 but
 but
 but
 does
 this
 create


new
 companies?
 I
 mean,
 you
 go
 back
 to


the
 mobile,
 you
 know,
 there
 was
 a
 time


when
 people
 thought
 that
 blogs
 were


going
 to
 be
 a
 diff
 different
 to
 the
 web,


which
 seems
 weird
 now,
 like
 Google


needed
 like
 a
 separate
 blog
 search.
 This


was
 seriously
 this
 was
 a
 thing.
 Um,


there
 was
 a
 time
 when
 it
 was
 really
 not


clear,
 and
 I
 think
 you
 kind
 of


generalize
 his
 point.


You
 go
 back
 to
 the
 internet
 in
 the
 mid


'9s,
 you
 know,
 we
 kind
 of
 knew
 this
 was


going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 thing.
 We
 didn't


really
 know
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be
 the
 web.


So
 before
 that,
 we
 didn't
 know
 it
 was


going to
 be
 the
 internet.
 We
 knew
 there


were
 going
 to
 be
 networks.
 We
 w
 didn't


know
 it
 wasn't
 clear
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be


the
 internet.
 Then
 it
 wasn't
 clear
 it


was
 going
 to
 be
 the
 web.
 Then
 it
 wasn't


really
 clear
 how
 the
 web
 was
 going
 to


work.
 And
 you
 know
 when
 when
 Netscape


launched
 like
 Mark
 Zuckerberg
 was
 in


junior
 high
 or
 you
 know
 elementary


school
 or
 something
 and
 you
 know
 Larry


and
 Sergey
 were
 students
 and
 like
 Amazon


was
 a
 bookstore.
 So
 you
 can
 know
 it
 but


not
 know
 it.
 And
 you
 could
 make
 the
 same


point
 about
 smartphones
 like
 it
 was
 we


knew
 everyone
 was
 going
 to
 have
 an


internet
 connected
 thing
 in
 their
 pocket


but
 it
 was
 not
 clear
 it
 was
 basically


going
 to
 be
 a
 PC
 from
 this
 has
 been
 PC


company
 from
 the
 80s
 and
 a
 search
 engine


company.
 It
 was
 not
 clear
 it
 wasn't


going to
 be
 Nocu
 Microsoft.
 See
 I
 think


you
 have
 to
 be
 super
 careful
 in
 like


predict
 making
 making
 kind
 of


deterministic
 predictions
 about
 this.


What
 you
 can
 do
 is
 say,
 well,


when
 this
 stuff
 happens,
 everything


changes.
 And
 that's
 happened
 five
 or
 10


times
 before.


>> I'm
 curious
 how
 you
 got
 conviction
 in


this
 idea
 or
 we
 got
 the
 prediction
 that


hey,
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 be
 as
 big
 as
 the


internet,
 which
 of
 course
 is
 pretty
 big,


but
 I'm
 not
 yet
 I
 benedict.
 I'm
 not
 yet


at
 the
 conviction
 that
 it's
 going to
 be


any
 bigger.
 I'm
 curious
 what
 what
 sort


of
 inspires
 that
 sort
 of
 uh,
 you
 know,


sort
 of
 state
 statement.
 And
 then
 also,


what
 might
 change
 your
 mind
 either
 way?


you
 know
 that
 it
 might
 not
 be
 as
 big
 as


the
 internet
 because
 of
 course
 the


internet
 was
 obviously
 very
 big
 uh
 but


also
 that
 hey
 perhaps
 it
 might
 be
 bigger


>> well
 so
 I
 think
 you
 know
 I
 don't
 want
 to


I
 remember
 I
 made
 a
 diagram
 of
 kind
 of


scurves
 kind
 of
 going
 up
 slightly


someone
 said
 well
 what's
 the
 axis
 on


this
 diagram
 I
 you
 know
 I
 don't
 want
 to


kind
 of
 get
 into
 you
 know
 is
 this
 is


this
 5%
 bigger
 than
 than
 internet
 or
 is


it
 20%
 bigger
 I
 think
 the
 question
 is


more
 like
 is
 it
 another
 of
 these


industry
 cycles
 or
 is
 it
 a
 much
 more


fundamental
 change
 in
 in
 what
 technology


can
 be
 is
 it
 more
 like
 computing
 or


electricity
 as
 a
 sort
 of
 structural


change
 rather
 than
 here's
 a
 whole
 bunch


more
 stuff
 we
 can
 do
 with
 computers.
 I


think
 that's
 sort
 of
 the
 the
 question


and
 there's
 a
 funny
 sort
 of
 disconnect
 I


think
 in
 in
 looking
 at
 debates
 about


this
 within
 tech
 because
 you
 know
 I


watched
 this
 this
 this
 this
 one
 of
 the


um
 open
 AI
 live
 streams
 a
 couple
 of


weeks
 ago
 and
 they
 spend
 the
 first
 20


minutes
 talking
 about
 how
 they're
 going


to
 have
 like
 human
 level
 PhD
 level
 AI


researchers
 like
 next
 year
 and
 then
 the


second
 half
 of
 the
 stream
 is
 oh
 and


here's
 our
 API
 stack
 that's
 going
 to


enable
 hundreds
 and
 thousands
 of
 new


software
 developers
 just
 like
 Windows


and
 in
 fact
 literally
 quote
 Bill
 Gates


and
 you
 think
 well
 those
 can't
 kind
 both


be
 true.
 Like
 either
 I've
 got
 a
 thing


which
 is
 a
 PhD
 level
 AI
 researcher
 which


by
 implication
 is
 like
 a
 PhD
 level
 CPA.


>> Yeah.


>> Or
 I've
 got
 a
 new
 piece
 of
 software
 that


does
 my
 taxes
 for
 me
 and
 well
 which
 is


it?
 Either
 this
 thing
 is
 going
 to
 be


like
 human
 level
 and
 some
 and
 that's
 a


very
 very
 challenging
 problematic


complicated
 statement
 or
 this
 is
 going


to
 let
 us
 make
 more
 software
 that
 can
 do


more
 things
 the
 software
 couldn't
 be.


And
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 real
 like


schizophrenia


in
 conversations
 around
 this
 because


like
 scaling
 laws
 and
 it's
 going
 to


scale
 all
 the
 way
 and
 meanwhile
 I'm


going
 here
 look
 how
 good
 it
 is
 at


writing
 code
 and
 again
 like
 well
 is
 it


writing
 code
 or
 do
 we
 not
 need
 software


anymore
 because
 in
 principle
 if
 the


models
 keep
 scaling
 nobody's
 going
 to


write
 code
 anymore.
 You'll
 just
 say
 to


the
 model
 like
 hey
 can
 you
 do
 this
 thing


for
 me?


>> Yeah.
 Is
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 hedge
 or


like
 a
 sequencing
 thing
 or?


>> Well,
 it's
 a
 it's
 some
 of
 it's
 a


sequencing
 thing,
 but
 you
 know,
 in


principle,
 if
 you
 think
 this
 stuff
 is


going
 to
 keep
 scaling,
 like
 why
 are
 you


investing
 in
 a
 software
 company?


>> Yeah.


>> Like,
 you
 know,
 we'll
 just
 have
 this


like
 god
 in
 a
 box
 that
 can
 do


everything.
 And
 and
 and
 I
 think
 this
 is


but
 this
 is
 the
 the
 kind
 of
 the
 funny


kind
 of
 challenge
 and
 this
 is
 I
 think


the
 fundamental
 way
 that
 this
 is


different
 from
 previous
 platform
 shifts


is
 that
 with
 the
 internet
 or
 with
 mobile


or
 being
 deemed
 with
 mobile
 main
 frame


is
 like
 you
 didn't
 know
 what
 was
 going


to
 happen
 in
 the
 next
 couple
 of
 years


you
 didn't
 know
 that
 what
 Amazon
 would


become
 and
 you
 didn't
 know
 how
 Netscape


was
 going
 to
 work
 out
 and
 you
 didn't


know
 what
 next
 year's
 iPhone
 was
 going


to
 be
 and
 10
 years
 ago
 when
 we
 cared


about
 that
 you
 kind
 of
 knew
 the
 physical


limits
 like
 you
 knew
 in
 1995
 you
 knew


that
 Telos
 were
 not
 going
 to
 give


everybody
 gigabit
 fiber
 next


and
 you
 knew
 that
 the
 iPhone
 wasn't


going
 to
 like
 have
 a
 year's
 battery
 life


and
 unroll
 and
 have
 a
 projector
 and
 fly


or
 whatever.
 But
 we
 don't
 know
 the


physical
 limits
 of
 this
 technology


because
 we
 don't
 really
 have
 a
 good


theoretical
 understanding
 of
 why
 it


works
 so
 well.
 Nor
 indeed
 do
 we
 have
 a


good
 theoretical
 understanding
 of
 what


human
 intelligence
 is
 and
 so
 we
 don't


know
 how
 much
 better
 it
 can
 get.
 So
 you


can
 do
 you
 could
 do
 a
 chart
 and
 you


could
 say
 well
 you
 know
 this
 is
 the
 road


map
 for
 modems
 and
 this
 is
 the
 road
 map


for
 DSL
 and
 this
 is
 how
 fast
 DSL
 will
 be


and
 then
 you
 can
 make
 some
 guesses
 about


how
 quickly
 Telos
 will
 deploy
 DSL
 and


then
 you
 can
 say
 well
 clearly
 we're
 not


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 replace
 broadcast
 TV


with
 streaming
 in
 1998


but
 we
 don't
 have
 an
 equivalent
 way
 of


modeling
 this
 stuff
 to
 know
 what
 is
 the


fundamental
 capability
 of
 it
 going
 to


look
 like
 in
 3
 years
 um
 which
 gets
 you


to
 these
 kind
 of
 slightly
 vibes-based


forecasting
 where
 no
 one
 really
 knows.


So,
 you
 know,
 Jeff
 In
 says,
 "Well,
 I


feel
 like"
 and
 Demis
 says,
 "Well,
 I
 feel


like,"
 but
 no
 one
 knows.


>> And
 then
 Karpathi
 goes
 into
 our
 podcast


and
 says,
 "I
 feel
 like,
 you
 know,
 it's
 a


decade
 out."


>> Yeah,
 I
 know.
 Well,
 I
 saw
 this
 this
 meme


of
 um
 of
 what's


but
 like
 he
 says
 like
 the
 answer
 will


reveal
 itself.
 And
 somebody
 like
 me'd


I'm
 going
 to
 say
 photoshopped,
 but
 of


course
 he
 wouldn't
 have
 been


photoshopped.
 turned
 him
 into
 a
 Buddhist


monk
 wearing
 like
 an
 orange
 like
 an


orange
 outfit
 like
 the
 future
 will


reveal
 itself.
 Well,
 but
 this
 is
 the


problem.
 We
 don't
 know.
 We
 don't
 have
 a


way
 of
 modeling
 this.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 let's
 connect
 this
 to
 sort


of
 the
 you
 know
 the
 upfront
 investment


that
 some
 of
 these
 companies
 are
 making.


Um
 because
 we
 don't
 know
 you
 know
 is


there
 a
 risk
 of
 overinvestment
 leading


to
 some
 you
 know
 potential
 uh
 you
 know


bubble-l
 like
 mechanics
 or
 h
 how
 do
 you


think
 about
 that
 that
 question?
 Well,


deterministically,
 very
 new,
 very,
 very


big,
 very,
 very
 exciting
 world's


changing
 things
 tend
 to
 lead
 to
 bubbles.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 you
 I
 don't
 think
 anybody
 would


dispute
 that
 you
 can
 see
 some
 bubbly


behavior
 now.
 And
 you
 know,
 you
 can


argue
 about
 what
 kind
 of
 bubble,
 but


again,
 like
 that
 doesn't
 have
 very
 much


predictive
 power.
 And
 you
 know,
 one
 of


the
 the
 features
 of
 bubbles
 is
 that
 when


everything's
 going,
 you
 know,
 everything


goes
 up
 all
 at
 once
 and
 everyone
 looks


like
 a
 genius
 and
 everyone
 leverages
 and


cross
 leverages
 and
 does
 circular


revenue
 and
 that's
 great
 until
 it's
 not.


Um,
 and
 then
 you
 get
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 ratchet


effect
 as
 it
 goes
 back
 down
 again.
 Um,


so
 yeah,
 if
 we're
 not
 in
 a
 bubble
 now,


we
 will
 be.
 I
 remember
 Mark
 Andre


saying,
 you
 know,
 1997
 was
 not
 a
 bubble.


98
 was
 not
 a
 bubble.
 99
 was
 a
 bubble.


Um,
 are
 we
 in
 97
 now
 or
 98
 or
 99?
 I
 you


know
 if
 we
 could
 predict
 that
 you
 know


we'd
 live
 in
 a
 parallel
 universe.
 Um
 I


think
 you
 know
 to
 the
 there's
 I
 suppose


maybe
 kind
 of
 two
 more
 specific
 more


more
 tangible
 answers
 to
 this.
 The
 first


of
 them
 is
 we
 don't
 really
 know
 what
 the


compute
 requirements
 of
 this
 stuff
 are


going
 to
 be
 and
 forecasting
 that
 except


like
 more
 and
 forecasting
 that
 feels
 a


lot
 like
 trying
 to
 forecast
 like


bandwidth
 use
 in
 the
 late
 '9s.
 Imagine


if
 you
 were
 trying
 to
 do
 the
 algebra
 on


that.
 You
 say,
 "Well,
 this
 many
 users,


you
 know,
 how
 much
 bandwidth
 does
 a
 web


page
 use?
 How
 will
 that
 change?
 How
 will


that
 change
 as
 bandwidth
 gets
 faster?


What
 happens
 with
 video?
 What
 kind
 of


video?
 What
 bandwidth
 of
 what
 what
 bit


rate
 of
 video?
 How
 long
 do
 people
 watch


a
 video?
 How
 much
 video?"
 And
 then
 you'd


like
 you
 you
 could
 build
 the
 spreadsheet


and
 it
 would
 tell
 you
 what
 bit
 rate


would
 what
 global
 bandwidth
 consumption


would
 be
 in
 10
 years.
 And
 then
 you
 could


try
 and
 use
 that
 to
 back
 calculate
 how


many
 routters
 is
 this
 going
 going
 to


sell.
 And
 you
 could
 get
 a
 number
 but
 it


wouldn't
 be
 the
 number
 you
 know
 there'd


be
 a
 you
 know
 hundfold
 range
 of
 possible


outcomes
 from
 that
 and
 you
 could
 you


know
 you
 could
 make
 the
 same
 point
 about


algebra
 of
 of
 consumption
 now.


So
 you
 know
 right
 now
 we
 have
 a
 bunch
 of


rational
 actors
 saying
 well
 this
 stuff


is
 transformative
 and
 a
 huge
 threat
 and


we
 can't
 keep
 up
 with
 demand
 for
 it
 now


and
 as
 far
 as
 we
 know
 the
 demand
 is


going
 to
 keep
 going
 up.
 And
 you
 know,


we've
 had
 a
 variety
 of
 quotes
 from
 all


of
 the
 hyperscalers
 basically
 saying
 the


downside
 of
 not
 investing
 is
 bigger
 than


the
 downside
 of
 overinvesting.
 Um


that's
 um
 or
 that
 kind
 of
 thing
 always


works
 well
 until
 it
 doesn't.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 I
 saw
 slightly
 strange
 quote
 from


Mark
 Zuckerberg
 saying,
 "Well,
 if
 it


turns
 out
 that
 we've
 overinvested,
 we


can
 just
 re
 resell
 the
 capacity."
 And
 I


thought,
 let
 me
 just
 like
 stop
 you


there,
 Mark,
 cuz
 if
 it
 turns
 out
 that


you
 can't
 use
 your
 capacity,
 everybody


else
 going
 to
 have
 loads
 of
 spare


capacity
 as
 well.


>> Yeah.


>> All
 these
 people
 now
 who
 are
 desperate


for
 more
 capacity,
 if
 it
 turns
 out
 we


can
 get
 the
 same
 results
 for
 hundreds
 of


the
 compute.


>> That
 will
 be
 true
 for
 everyone
 else
 too,


not
 just
 you.


>> Yeah.
 So
 yeah,
 you
 know,
 in
 a
 investment


cycle
 like
 this,
 you
 tend
 to
 get


overinvestment,
 but
 then
 after
 that,


there's
 very
 limited
 predictions
 you
 can


make
 about
 what's
 going
 to
 happen.
 I


think
 the
 the
 more
 useful


kind
 of
 way
 to
 look
 at
 this
 is
 to
 think


well


you've
 got
 these
 kind
 of
 transformative


capabilities


that
 are
 already
 increasing
 the
 value
 of


your
 existing
 products
 if
 you're
 you're


Google
 or
 Meta
 or
 Amazon
 and
 you're


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 use
 them
 to
 build
 a


bunch
 more
 stuff


and


why
 would
 you
 want
 to
 let
 somebody
 else


do
 that
 rather
 than
 you
 doing
 it
 as
 long


as
 you're
 able
 to
 keep
 funding
 and


selling
 what
 you're
 building.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 it
 may
 well
 turn
 out
 that
 you
 know


we
 have
 an
 evolution
 of
 models
 in
 the


next
 year.
 That
 means
 you
 can
 get
 the


same
 result
 for
 100
 of
 the
 compute
 that


you're
 using
 today.
 Bearing
 in
 mind
 that


it's
 already
 going
 down
 like
 depend
 pick


your
 numbers
 20
 30
 40
 times
 a
 year.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 then
 the
 usage
 is
 going
 up.
 So


you're
 in
 this
 very,
 as
 I
 said,
 it's


like
 trying
 to
 predict
 bandwidth


consumption
 in
 the
 late
 90s,
 early


2000s.
 You
 know,
 you
 can
 you
 can
 throw


all
 the
 parameters
 out,
 but
 it
 doesn't


get
 you
 to
 something
 useful.
 You
 just


kind
 of
 need
 to
 step
 back
 and
 say,


"Yeah,
 but
 is
 this
 internet
 thing
 any


good?"


>> Well,
 yeah,
 cuz
 I'm
 curious
 if
 the


bottlenecks
 are
 if
 you
 see
 them
 as
 more


on
 the
 supply
 side
 or
 the
 demand
 side,


you
 know,
 more
 technical
 constraints
 or


is
 just
 is
 AI
 any
 good?
 Are
 are
 there


enough
 use
 cases
 to
 to
 justify
 the
 the


the
 type
 of
 SP
 what
 are
 what
 are
 you


seeing
 and
 and
 what
 are
 you
 predicting?


>> So
 maybe
 two
 answers
 to
 this
 question.


The
 first
 of
 them
 is
 I
 think
 we've
 had


this
 sort
 of
 a
 a
 bifocation
 of
 what
 all


the
 questions
 are.
 So
 there
 are
 now
 very


very
 detailed
 conversations
 about
 chips


and
 then
 very
 very
 detailed


conversations
 about
 data
 centers
 and


about
 funding
 for
 data
 centers
 and
 then


about
 what
 does
 a
 a
 new
 enterprise
 SAS


company
 built
 on
 AI?
 what
 margins
 will


it
 have
 and
 how
 much
 money
 does
 it
 need


to
 raise
 and
 so
 there
 are
 venture


capital
 conversations
 and
 so
 there
 are


many
 different
 conversations
 within


which
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 anything
 about


chips
 you
 know
 I
 can
 spell
 ultraviolet


but
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 like
 an


ultraviolet
 process
 is
 um
 it's
 like
 it's


more
 it's
 more
 more
 violets
 I
 don't
 know


um


and
 so
 you've
 got
 this
 you
 know
 it's


like
 the
 the
 Milton
 Friedman
 line
 no
 one


knows
 how
 to
 build
 a
 pencil
 you've
 got


the
 you
 know
 we've
 got
 this
 you
 it's


turned
 into
 I
 think
 a
 second
 answer


might
 B,
 I
 think
 there's
 two
 kinds
 of
 AI


deployment,
 generative
 AI
 deployment.


One
 of
 them
 is
 there
 are
 places
 where


it's
 very
 easy
 and
 obvious
 right
 now
 to


see
 what
 you
 would
 do
 with
 this,
 which


is
 basically
 software
 development,


marketing,


um,
 point
 solutions
 for
 many
 very


boring,
 very
 specific
 enterprise
 use


cases.
 And
 also
 basically
 people
 like
 us


which
 are
 people
 who
 have
 kind
 of
 very


open,
 very
 free
 form,
 very
 flexible
 jobs


with
 many
 different
 things
 and
 people


who
 are
 always
 looking
 for
 ways
 to


optimize
 that.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 so
 you
 get
 people
 in
 Silicon
 Valley


who
 are
 like,
 you
 know,
 I
 spend
 all
 my


diet
 time
 in
 DBT.
 I
 don't
 use
 Google


anymore.
 You
 know,
 I've
 replaced
 my
 CRM


with
 this.
 Um,
 and
 you
 kind
 of
 and
 then


you
 obviously
 people
 who
 write
 if
 you're


writing
 codes,
 this
 works
 really
 well.


Well,
 if
 you're
 in
 marketing,
 you
 know,


all
 these
 stories
 of
 big
 companies


where,
 you
 know,
 they're
 making
 300


assets
 where
 they
 would
 have
 made
 30.


Um,
 and
 then
 Accenture
 and
 Bane
 and


McKenzie
 and
 Infosys
 and
 so
 on
 sitting


and
 solving
 very
 specific
 problems


inside
 big
 companies.
 Then
 there's
 a


whole
 bunch
 of
 other
 people
 who
 look
 at


it
 and
 they're
 like,


it's
 okay.


and
 you
 go
 and
 look
 at
 the
 usage
 data


and
 you
 see
 okay
 chat
 GPT
 has
 got
 8
 or


900
 million
 weekly
 active
 users
 5%
 of


people
 are
 paying


and
 then
 you
 go
 and
 look
 at
 all
 the


survey
 data
 and
 you
 know
 it's
 very


fragmented
 and
 inconsistent
 but
 it
 all


sort
 of
 points
 to
 like
 something
 like
 10


or
 15%
 of
 people
 in
 the
 developed
 world


are
 using
 this
 every
 day
 another
 20
 or


30%
 of
 people
 are
 using
 it
 every
 week


and
 if
 you're
 the
 kind
 of
 person
 who
 is


using
 this
 for
 hours
 every
 day.
 Ask


yourself
 why
 five
 times
 more
 people
 look


at
 it,
 get
 it,
 know
 what
 it
 is,
 have
 an


account,
 know
 how
 to
 use
 it,
 and
 can't


think
 of
 anything
 to
 do
 with
 it
 this


week
 or
 next
 week.


>> Why
 is
 that?


>> Yeah.


>> Is
 it
 because
 it
 early?
 And
 it's
 not


like
 a
 young
 people
 thing
 either,


incidentally.
 And
 so,
 is
 that
 just


because
 it's
 early?
 Is
 it
 because
 of
 the


error
 rates?
 Is
 it
 because
 you
 have
 to


map
 it
 against
 what
 you
 do
 every
 day?


And
 one
 of
 the
 the
 analogy
 I
 always
 used


to
 use
 which
 isn't
 in
 the
 current


presentation
 I've
 been
 used
 in
 previous


presentations
 is
 imagine
 you're
 an


accountant
 and
 you
 see
 software


spreadsheets
 for
 the
 first
 time.
 This


thing
 can
 do
 a
 month
 of
 work
 in
 10


minutes
 almost
 literally.


>> Yeah.


You
 want
 to
 change
 you
 want
 to


recalculate
 that
 DCF
 that
 10ear
 DCF
 with


a
 different
 discount
 rate.
 I've
 done
 it


before
 you
 finished
 asking
 me
 to.
 And


that
 would
 have
 been
 like
 a
 day
 or
 two


days
 or
 three
 days
 of
 work
 to


recalculate
 all
 those
 numbers.
 Great.


Now,
 imagine
 you're
 a
 lawyer
 and
 you
 see


it.
 And
 you
 think,
 well,
 that's
 great.


My
 accountant
 should
 see
 it.
 Maybe
 I'll


use
 it
 next
 week
 when
 I'm
 making
 a
 table


of
 my
 billable
 hours,
 but
 that's
 not


what
 I
 do
 all
 day.
 And
 Excel
 is
 doesn't


use
 do
 things
 that
 a
 lawyer
 can
 do
 every


day.
 And
 I
 think
 those
 there's
 this


other
 class
 of
 person
 that's
 like
 I'm


not
 sure
 what
 to
 do
 with
 this.
 And
 some


of
 that
 is
 habit.
 Some
 of
 that
 is
 like


realizing
 no
 instead
 of
 doing
 it
 that


way
 I
 could
 do
 it
 this
 way.
 But
 that's


also
 what
 products
 are.
 Like
 every


entrepreneur
 who
 comes
 into
 a
 16Z
 when
 I


was
 there
 from
 2014
 to
 2019
 and
 I'm
 sure


now
 like
 you
 could
 look
 at
 any
 company


that
 comes
 in
 and
 say
 that's
 basically
 a


database.
 That's
 basically
 a
 CRM.


That's
 basically
 Oracle
 or
 Google
 Docs


except
 that
 they've
 realized
 there's


this
 problem
 or
 this
 workflow
 inside


this
 industry
 and
 worked
 out
 how
 to
 use


a
 database
 or
 a
 CRM
 or
 basically


concepts
 from
 5,
 10,
 20
 years
 ago
 and


solve
 that
 problem
 for
 people
 in
 that


industry
 and
 go
 in
 and
 sell
 it
 to
 them


and
 work
 out
 how
 they
 can
 get
 it
 to
 use


it.
 And
 so
 this
 is
 why,
 you
 know,
 you


look
 look
 at
 data
 on
 this
 that
 you


depending
 on
 how
 you
 count
 it,
 the


typical
 big
 company
 today
 has
 4
 to
 500


SAS
 apps
 in
 the
 US.
 4
 to
 500
 SAS


applications
 and
 they're
 all
 basically


doing
 something
 you
 could
 do
 in
 Oracle


or
 Excel
 or
 email.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 that's
 the
 other
 side.
 I'm


monologuing,
 I'm
 afraid,
 but
 like
 this


is
 the
 other
 side
 of
 what
 is
 what
 do
 you


do
 with
 these
 things?
 Do
 you
 just
 go
 to


the
 bot
 and
 ask
 it
 to
 do
 a
 thing
 for


you?
 Or
 does
 an
 enterprise
 salesperson


come
 to
 your
 boss
 and
 sell
 you
 a
 thing


that
 means
 now
 you
 press
 a
 button
 and
 it


analyzes
 this
 process
 that
 you
 needed


that
 you
 never
 realized
 you
 were
 even


doing.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I
 feel
 like
 that's
 I
 mean
 that's
 why


there
 are
 AI
 software
 companies,


>> right?


>> Really?
 Isn't
 that
 what
 they're
 doing?


They're
 unbundling
 chat
 GBT
 just
 as
 the


enterprise
 software
 company
 of
 10
 years


ago
 was
 unbundling
 Oracle
 or
 Google
 or


Excel.
 Do
 you
 have
 the
 view
 that
 you


know
 what
 Excel
 did
 for
 for
 for


accountants
 um
 you
 know
 we're
 sort
 of
 AI


is
 now
 doing
 for
 for
 coders
 um
 and


developers
 but
 hasn't
 quite
 figured
 out


that
 sort
 of
 you
 know
 daily
 critical


workflow
 for
 for
 other
 job
 positions
 and


so
 it's
 unclear
 for
 people
 who
 aren't


developers
 you
 know
 why
 I
 should
 be


using
 this
 for
 many
 many
 hours
 a
 day
 or


>> I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who


don't
 have
 tasks
 that
 work
 very
 well


with
 this.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people


who
 need
 it
 to
 be
 wrapped
 in
 a
 product


and
 a
 workflow
 and
 tooling
 and
 UX
 and


someone
 to
 come
 and
 say,
 "Hey,
 have
 you


realized
 you
 could
 do
 it
 with
 this?"


Um
 I
 had
 this
 conversation
 with
 um
 in


the
 summer
 with
 with
 with
 with
 Balagi


who's
 another
 a
 former
 A6Z
 person
 and
 he


was
 making
 this
 point
 about
 validation


that
 can
 you
 because
 these
 things
 still


get
 stuff
 wrong
 and
 people
 in
 the
 valley


often
 kind
 of
 handwave
 this
 away
 but
 you


know
 there
 are
 questions
 that
 have


specific
 answers
 where
 it
 needs
 to
 be


the
 right
 answer
 or
 one
 of
 a
 limited
 set


of
 right
 answers.
 Can
 you
 validate
 that


mechanistically?


Um,
 if
 not,
 is
 it
 efficient
 to
 validate


it
 with
 people?
 So,
 you
 know,
 with
 the


marketing
 use
 case,
 it's
 a
 lot
 more


efficient
 to
 get
 a
 machine
 to
 make
 you


200
 pictures
 and
 then
 have
 a
 person
 look


at
 them
 and
 pick
 10
 that
 are
 good
 than


to
 have
 um
 people
 make
 10
 good
 images
 or


100
 you
 even
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 make
 500


images
 and
 pick
 a
 100
 that
 are
 good.


That's
 a
 lot
 more
 efficient
 than
 having


a
 person
 make
 100
 images.
 Um
 but
 on
 the


other
 hand,
 if
 you're
 doing
 something


like
 data
 entry
 and
 this
 I
 wrote


something
 about
 this
 about
 um
 about
 open


launch
 deep
 research
 open
 launch
 deep


research
 their
 whole
 marketing
 case
 is


it
 go
 goes
 off
 and
 collects
 data
 about


the
 mobile
 market.
 I
 used
 to
 be
 a
 mobile


analyst.
 The
 numbers
 are
 all
 wrong.


Their
 use
 case
 of
 look
 how
 useful
 this


is.
 Their
 numbers
 are
 wrong.
 And
 in
 some


cases
 they're
 wrong
 because
 they've


literally
 transcribed
 the
 number


incorrectly
 from
 the
 source.
 In
 other


cases,
 it's
 wrong
 because
 they've
 used
 a


source
 that
 they
 shouldn't
 have
 used.


But
 like
 if
 I'd
 asked
 an
 intern
 to
 do
 it


for
 me,
 then
 an
 intern
 would
 probably


have
 picked
 that.
 And
 to
 my
 the
 point


about,
 you
 know,
 verification,
 if
 you're


going
 to
 do
 data
 entry,
 if
 I'm
 going
 to


ask
 a
 machine
 to
 copy
 200
 numbers
 out
 of


200
 PDFs,
 and
 then
 I'm
 going
 to
 have
 to


check
 all
 200
 of
 those
 numbers,
 I
 might


as
 well
 just
 do
 it
 myself.


>> Yeah.
 So
 you've
 got
 like
 a
 whole


swirling
 matrix
 of
 how
 do
 you
 map
 this


against
 existing
 problems?
 But
 the
 other


side
 of
 it
 is
 how
 do
 you
 map
 this


against
 new
 things
 that
 you
 couldn't


have
 done
 before?


And
 this
 comes
 back
 to
 my
 my
 point
 about


platform
 chips
 because
 you
 know
 you
 know


I
 see
 people
 looking
 at
 chbt
 or
 looking


at
 generative
 AI
 and
 saying
 well
 this
 is


this
 is
 useless
 because
 it
 makes


mistakes
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 kind
 of
 like


looking
 at
 like
 an
 Apple
 2
 in
 the
 late


'7s
 and
 saying
 could
 you
 use
 these
 to


run
 banks
 to
 which
 your
 answer
 is
 no
 but


that's
 kind
 of
 the
 wrong
 question


>> right


>> like
 could
 you
 build
 video
 edit


professional
 video
 editing
 inside


Netscape
 no
 but
 that's
 the
 wrong


question
 right


>> and
 later
 yeah
 20
 years
 data
 you
 can
 but


that
 meanwhile
 it
 does
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of


other
 stuff
 and
 the
 same
 with
 mobile


like
 can
 you
 can
 you
 use
 mobile
 to


replace
 you
 know
 your
 you
 know
 your
 five


screen
 professional
 programming
 rig
 no


therefore
 it
 can't
 replace
 PCs
 well


guess
 what
 5
 billion
 people
 have
 got
 a


smartphone
 and
 seven
 or
 800
 million


people
 have
 got
 a
 consumer
 PC
 so
 it
 kind


of
 did
 but
 did
 a
 different
 thing
 and
 the


point
 of
 this
 is
 like
 the
 new
 thing
 this


is
 you
 know
 the
 disruption
 framing
 you


mentioned
 earlier
 the
 new
 thing
 is


generally
 not
 very
 good
 or
 terrible
 at


the
 stuff
 that
 was
 important
 to
 the
 old


thing
 but
 it
 does
 something
 else


>> right
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 question
 is
 okay


it
 may
 not
 be
 very
 good
 at
 doing
 there's


a
 class
 of
 old
 task
 that
 generative
 AI


is
 good
 at.
 There's
 also
 lot
 many
 more


old
 tasks
 that
 generative
 AI
 is
 maybe


not
 very
 good
 at.
 But
 then
 there's
 a


whole
 bunch
 of
 other
 things
 that
 you


would
 never
 have
 done
 before
 that


generative
 is
 really
 really
 good
 at


and
 then
 how
 do
 you
 find
 those
 or
 think


of
 those?
 And
 how
 much
 of
 that
 is
 the


user
 thinking
 of
 it
 faced
 with
 a
 general


purpose
 chatbot?
 How
 much
 of
 that
 is
 the


entrepreneur
 saying,
 "Hey,
 I've
 just


realized
 that
 there's
 this
 thing
 that
 I


can
 do
 that
 you
 couldn't
 do
 before
 and


here
 you
 are.
 I've
 given
 you
 a
 product


with
 a
 button
 that
 will
 do
 it
 for
 you,


>> right?


>> And
 it's
 why
 there
 are
 software


companies,


>> right?
 And
 and
 on
 on
 mobile,
 you
 know,


some
 of
 the
 new
 use
 cases,
 you
 know,


we're
 you
 know,
 getting
 in
 strangers


cars,
 you
 know,
 we
 mentioned
 lift
 an


Uber
 or
 sort
 of,
 you
 know,
 dating
 people


you
 met
 via
 an
 app
 or
 um
 sort
 of
 um
 you


know,
 lending
 your
 spare
 bedroom
 out
 um


you
 know,
 etc.
 And
 and
 those
 were
 net


new
 companies
 that
 that
 that
 you
 know,


were
 built
 around
 those
 behaviors.
 And
 I


think
 for
 AI
 there's
 still
 questions
 of


you
 know
 what
 are
 those
 net
 new


behaviors
 we're
 starting
 to
 see
 some
 in


terms
 of
 you
 know
 people
 engaging
 and


talking
 with
 you
 know
 chat
 bots
 instead


of
 humans
 or
 or
 um
 or
 in
 addition
 um
 and


then
 there's
 a
 question
 of
 hey
 are
 these


done
 by
 the
 uh
 model
 providers
 that
 that


currently
 exist
 or
 are
 these
 done
 by
 you


know
 net
 new
 companies
 both
 on
 you
 know


sort
 of
 enterprise
 and
 consumer.


>> Well
 this
 is
 always
 a
 question
 is
 how


far
 up
 the
 stack
 does
 the
 new
 thing
 go?


Um,
 and
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 was
 talking
 about


this
 with
 another
 former
 former
 A6Z


person
 who
 pointed
 out
 that
 like
 in
 the


the
 the
 mid
 '90s,
 um,
 people
 kind
 of


argued
 that,
 well,
 you
 know,
 the


operating
 system
 does
 all
 of
 it
 and
 the


Windows
 apps
 are
 basically
 just
 kind
 of


thin
 Win332
 rappers.


>> Yeah.
 And
 you
 know,
 office
 is
 basically


just
 you
 know a
 thin
 wind32
 wrapper
 like


all
 the
 important
 stuff
 is
 being
 done
 by


the
 OS
 whether
 it's
 you
 know
 the


document
 management
 and
 printing
 and


storage
 and
 display
 which
 all
 stuff
 that


used
 to
 be
 done
 by
 apps
 like
 in
 on
 DOSs


the
 apps
 had
 to
 do
 printing
 the
 apps
 had


to
 manage
 a
 display
 we
 moved
 to
 Windows


like
 90%
 of
 the
 stuff
 that
 the
 app
 used


to
 do
 is
 now
 being
 done
 by
 Windows


>> and
 so
 office
 is
 just
 like
 a
 thin
 wind32


wrapper
 and
 all
 the
 hard
 stuff
 has
 been


being
 done
 by
 the
 OS
 and
 it
 turns
 out


well
 that
 was
 again
 it's
 like
 frameworks


are
 useful
 but
 that's
 not
 maybe
 not
 a


useful
 way
 of
 thinking
 about
 what's


going
 on
 and
 the
 same
 thing
 now
 like
 how


much
 does
 this
 need
 single
 dedicated


understanding
 of
 how
 that
 market
 it


works
 or
 what
 that
 market
 is
 and
 what


you
 would
 do
 with
 that.
 Um
 I
 mean
 I


remember
 when
 we
 were
 at
 A16Z
 there
 was


an
 investment
 in
 a
 company
 called
 Everaw


which
 is
 cloud
 um
 legal
 discovery
 in
 the


cloud.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 so
 machine
 learning
 happens
 and
 so


now
 they
 can
 do
 translation.
 Are
 they


worried
 that
 lawyers
 are
 going
 to
 say


well
 we
 don't
 need
 you
 guys
 anymore.


we're
 just
 going
 to
 go
 and
 get
 a


translate
 app
 and
 a
 sentiment
 analysis


app
 from
 AWS.
 Like
 no,
 that's
 not
 how


law
 firms
 work.
 Law
 firms
 want
 to
 buy
 a


thing
 that
 sells
 want
 to
 buy
 legal


discovery
 software
 management.
 You
 know,


they
 don't
 want
 to,
 you
 know,
 go
 and


write
 their
 own
 by
 do
 API
 calls.
 I
 mean,


very,
 very
 big
 law
 firms
 might,
 but
 you


know,
 typical
 law
 firm
 isn't
 going
 to
 do


that.
 People
 buy
 solutions,
 they
 don't


buy
 technologies.
 And
 the
 same
 thing


here,
 like
 how
 far
 up
 the
 stack
 do
 these


models
 go?


um
 how
 much
 can
 you
 turn
 things
 into


um
 a
 widget?
 How
 much
 can
 you
 turn


things
 into
 an
 LM
 request?
 And
 how
 much


know
 does
 it
 turn
 out
 that
 you
 need
 that


dedicated
 UI?
 The
 funny
 thing
 is
 you
 can


see
 this
 around
 Google
 because
 Google


had
 this
 whole
 idea
 that
 everything


would
 just
 be
 a
 Google
 query
 and
 Google


would
 work
 out
 what
 the
 query
 was
 and


guess
 what
 you
 know
 now
 you
 want
 this


Google
 flights
 is
 not
 a
 Google
 query.


you
 know
 they
 you
 a
 certain
 point
 and


and
 one
 of
 the
 one
 of
 the
 interesting


things
 about
 this
 and
 I
 think
 it's


interesting
 to
 think
 about
 what
 a
 guey


is
 doing
 that
 some
 of
 what
 a
 guey
 is


doing
 and
 the
 obvious
 thing
 that
 a
 gooey


is
 doing
 is
 that
 it
 enables
 office
 to


have
 500
 application
 500
 features
 and


you
 can
 find
 them
 all
 at least
 it's
 you


don't
 have
 to
 memorize
 keyboard
 commands


you
 can
 now
 have
 effectively
 infinite


features
 and
 you
 can
 just
 keep
 adding


menus
 and
 dialog
 boxes
 and
 eventually


you
 you
 run
 out
 of
 screen
 space
 for


dialog
 boxes
 but
 like
 you
 can
 have


hundreds
 of
 features


without
 people
 needing
 to
 memorize


keyboard
 commands.
 But
 the
 other
 side
 of


it
 is
 you're
 in
 that
 dialogue
 box
 or


you're
 in
 that
 screen
 in
 that
 workflow


in
 Workday
 or
 Salesforce
 or
 whatever
 the


enterprise
 software
 is,
 whatever
 any


software
 or
 or or
 the
 airline
 website
 or


or
 Airbnb
 or
 whatever
 it
 is.
 And
 there


aren't
 600
 buttons
 on
 the
 screen.


There's
 seven
 buttons
 on
 the
 screen


because
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 at
 that


company
 have
 sat
 down
 and
 has
 thought,


what
 is
 it
 that
 the
 user
 should
 be
 asked


here?
 What
 questions
 should
 we
 give


them?
 what
 choices
 should
 there
 be
 at


this
 point
 in
 the
 flow?
 Um,
 and
 that


reflects
 a
 lot
 of
 institutional


knowledge
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 learning
 and
 a


lot
 of
 testing
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 really


careful
 thought
 about
 how
 this
 should


work.
 And
 then
 you
 give
 somebody
 a
 raw


prompt
 and
 you
 just
 say,
 "Okay,
 you
 just


tell
 the
 thing
 how
 to
 do
 the
 thing
 and


you're
 like,
 but
 you've
 kind
 of
 got
 to


shut
 your
 eyes,
 screw
 your
 eyes
 up
 and


think
 from
 first
 principles.
 How
 does


this
 all
 of
 this
 work?"
 It's
 kind
 of
 I


always
 used
 to
 talk
 about
 machine


learning
 as
 giving
 you
 infinite
 interns.


So,
 you
 know,
 imagine
 you've
 got
 a
 task


and
 you've
 got
 an
 intern
 and
 the
 intern


doesn't
 know
 what
 venture
 capital
 is.


>> How
 helpful
 are
 they
 going to
 and
 like


they
 and
 they
 don't
 know
 that
 companies


publish
 quarterly
 reports
 and
 that
 we've


got
 a
 Bloomberg
 account
 that
 lets
 us


look
 up
 multiples
 and
 that
 then
 you


should
 probably
 use
 um
 pitchbook
 for


this
 data
 and
 rather
 than
 using
 Google.


This
 is
 my
 point
 about
 deep
 research


like
 no
 you
 should
 use
 this
 source
 and


not
 that
 source.
 Um,


do
 you
 want
 to
 have
 to
 work
 that
 out


from
 scratch
 or
 do
 you
 want
 a
 bunch
 of


people
 who
 know
 a
 lot
 about
 this
 stuff


to
 have
 spent
 5
 years
 working
 out
 what


the
 choices
 should
 be
 on
 the
 screen
 for


you
 to
 click
 on
 it?
 I
 mean,
 it's
 the
 old


user
 interface
 saying
 the
 computer


should
 never
 ask
 you
 a
 question
 that
 you


should
 have
 to
 work
 out
 that
 it
 should


know
 by
 itself.
 You
 go
 to
 a
 blank
 raw


chatbot
 screen,
 it's
 asking
 you


literally
 everything.
 It's
 not
 just


asking
 you
 one
 question.
 It's
 asking
 you


absolutely
 everything
 about
 what
 is
 it


is
 that
 you
 want
 and
 how
 you're
 going
 to


work
 out
 what
 how
 to
 do
 it.


>> The
 and
 so
 you
 know
 you're
 mentioning


chat
 you
 right
 about
 how
 chatbt
 isn't


sort
 of
 a
 product
 as
 much
 as
 chatbot
 is


disguised
 as
 a
 as
 a
 product.
 I
 I
 am


curious
 you
 know
 when
 we
 sort
 of
 look


back
 at
 this
 sort
 of
 the
 you
 know


platform
 shift
 do
 you
 think
 that
 there


will
 be
 another
 sort
 of
 iPhone
 sort


ofesque
 or
 excelesque
 product
 that
 kind


of
 defines
 the
 the
 the
 feature
 the
 sort


of
 platform
 shift
 in
 a
 way
 that
 chat
 GPT


won't
 or
 or
 or
 is
 it
 sort
 of
 that
 the


world
 has
 to
 catch
 up
 to
 how
 to
 use
 chat


GPT
 or
 or
 something
 like
 chat


>> so
 both
 of
 these
 both
 of
 these
 can
 be


true
 because
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 it


took
 time
 to
 realize
 how
 you
 would
 use


Google
 Maps
 and
 what
 you
 could
 do
 with


Google
 and
 how
 you
 could
 use
 Instagram


and
 all
 of
 these
 products
 have
 evolved
 a


huge
 amount
 over
 time.
 So
 some
 of
 it
 is


like
 you
 grow
 towards
 realizing
 what
 you


could
 do
 with
 this
 like
 you
 realize


that's
 just
 a
 Google
 query
 now.
 You


realize
 that
 you
 could
 just
 do
 it
 like


that
 and
 you
 realize
 I
 spent
 you
 know


hours
 doing
 this
 and
 I
 just
 realized
 oh


I
 could
 actually
 just
 make
 a
 pivot


table.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 the
 other
 side
 of
 it
 is


then
 but
 you're
 still
 then
 expecting


people
 to
 work
 it
 out
 themselves
 from


first
 principles
 and
 you
 know
 it's
 kind


of
 useful
 to
 have
 somebody
 really
 100
 a


thousand
 10,000
 really
 clever
 people


sitting
 and
 trying
 to
 work
 out
 what


those
 things
 are
 and
 then
 showing
 it
 to


you
 as
 a
 as
 a
 product.
 I
 think
 another


side
 to
 this
 is
 like
 you
 know
 there
 were


always
 these
 precursors


so
 like
 there
 were
 lots
 of
 other
 things


before
 Instagram.


>> Yeah.
 You
 know,
 YouTube
 didn't
 start
 as


YouTube.
 It
 started
 as
 video
 dating,
 I


think.
 Um,
 there
 were
 lots
 of
 of


attempts
 to
 do
 online
 dating
 that
 all


kind
 of
 worked
 until
 Tinder
 kind
 of


pulled
 the
 whole
 thing
 inside
 out.
 And


so,
 there
 were
 always
 lots
 of
 things,


what's
 the
 phrase
 local
 maxima?
 In
 fact,


this
 is
 where
 we
 were,
 particularly
 with


the
 iPhone,
 um,
 before
 cuz
 I
 was
 working


in
 mobile
 for
 the
 previous
 decade.
 Um,


it
 didn't
 feel
 like
 we
 were
 waiting
 for


a
 thing.
 It
 felt
 like
 it
 was
 kind
 of


working
 like
 every
 year
 the
 networks
 got


faster
 and
 the
 phones
 got
 better
 and
 it


got
 a
 little
 bit
 better
 every
 year
 and


we
 had
 apps
 and
 we
 had
 app
 stores
 and
 we


had
 3G
 and
 we
 had
 cameras
 and
 stuff


seemed
 to
 be
 you
 know
 every
 year
 was
 a


bit
 better
 and
 then
 the
 iPhone
 arrives


and
 it
 just
 you
 know
 just
 you
 know
 below


the
 chart
 kind
 of
 you
 know
 you've
 got


this
 line
 doing
 this
 and
 then
 there's
 a


line
 that
 does
 that
 although
 remember


also
 the
 iPhone
 took
 like
 two
 years


before
 it
 worked
 because
 you
 know
 the


price
 was
 wrong
 and
 the
 feature
 set
 was


wrong
 and
 the
 distribution
 model
 didn't


quite
 work.
 Um
 and
 so
 yeah,
 you
 you


know,
 you
 can
 think
 your
 you
 know,
 you


can
 think
 everything's
 going
 well
 and


then
 something
 comes
 along
 and
 you


realize
 no,
 oh
 no,
 no,
 no,
 that's
 which


is
 the
 same
 for
 Google,
 you
 know,
 like


search
 was
 a
 thing
 before
 Google.
 It


just
 wasn't
 very
 good.
 Um
 so
 there
 were


lots
 of
 there
 was
 lots
 of
 social
 stuff


before
 Facebook
 and
 you
 know
 that
 was


the
 thing
 that
 that
 catalyzed
 it.
 So,


you
 know,
 I
 just
 think
 deterministically


this
 whole
 thing
 is
 so
 early
 that
 it


feels
 like
 of
 course
 there
 are
 going
 to


be,
 you
 know,
 dozens,
 hundreds
 of
 new


things.
 Otherwise,
 H&Z
 should
 just
 kind


of
 shut
 down
 and
 give
 the
 money
 back
 to


the
 LPS
 cuz
 the
 the
 foundation
 models


will
 just
 do
 the
 whole
 thing.
 And
 like
 I


don't
 think
 you're
 going
 to
 do that.
 At


least
 I
 hope
 not.


>> No,
 no,
 no.
 If
 we
 have
 any
 regrets
 from


the
 last
 few
 years,
 it's
 it's
 it's
 not


going
 bigger.
 I
 think
 we
 didn't
 fully


appreciate
 how
 much
 specialization
 there


would
 be
 across
 uh
 sort
 of
 you
 know


whether
 it's
 voice
 or
 image
 generation


or
 or
 take
 any
 sort
 of
 subsector
 that


there
 would
 be
 um
 you
 know
 net
 new


companies
 created
 that
 would
 be
 better


than
 the
 than
 the
 the
 the
 model


providers
 that
 that
 there
 would
 be
 even


multiple
 model
 providers
 that
 that
 or


that
 in
 every
 category.
 Um
 you
 know
 one


one
 thing
 we've
 always
 in
 the
 web
 two


era
 we
 always
 bet
 on
 the
 category
 winner


right
 and
 and
 the
 category
 winner
 would


take
 mo
 most
 of
 the
 market
 but
 these


markets
 are
 so
 big
 um
 and
 the
 the
 the


there's
 so
 much
 expertise
 and


specialization
 that
 in
 that
 there
 one


there
 can
 be
 winners
 in
 in
 every


category
 it's
 not
 just
 sort
 of
 the
 the


model
 providers
 take
 everything
 but
 that


even
 in
 every
 category
 including
 the


model
 providers
 there
 can
 be
 multiple


winners
 in
 increasing
 you
 know


specialization
 and
 and
 the
 the
 markets


are
 just
 big
 enough
 to
 to
 contain


multiple
 winners.


>> I
 think
 that's
 right.
 And
 I
 think
 you


know
 the
 categories
 themselves
 aren't


clear,
 right?


>> And
 you
 know
 many
 you
 know
 things
 you


think
 this
 is
 a
 category
 and
 it
 turns


out
 no
 it
 was
 actually
 that
 whole
 other


thing
 and
 the
 categories
 kind
 of
 get


unbundled
 and
 bundled
 and
 recombined
 in


different
 ways.
 I
 mean,
 I
 remember
 I
 was


a
 student
 in
 1995


and
 um
 there
 I
 think
 I
 had
 like
 four
 or


five
 different
 web
 browsers
 on
 my
 PC,


web
 servers
 on
 my
 PC
 cuz
 I
 mean
 Tim


Berners
 Le's
 original
 web
 browser
 had
 a


web
 editor
 in
 it
 because
 he
 thought
 this


was
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 network
 drive
 and
 it


was
 a
 sharing
 system
 and
 didn't
 realize


not
 not
 really
 a
 publishing
 system.
 So


you
 would
 have
 your
 web
 pages
 on
 your
 PC


and
 you'd
 use
 leave
 your
 PC
 turned
 on


and
 that
 would
 be
 how
 your
 colleagues


would
 look
 at
 your
 word
 documents


or
 your
 web
 pages.
 And
 so
 again,
 like
 we


just
 don't
 know
 how
 and
 and
 I
 just
 kind


of
 keep
 coming
 back
 to
 this
 point.
 I


feel
 like
 most
 of
 the
 questions
 we're


asking
 at
 the
 moment
 are
 probably
 the


wrong
 question.
 And
 picking
 up
 on
 on
 a


strand
 within
 what
 you
 just
 said,


though,
 the
 interesting
 one
 of the


things
 I'm
 sort
 of
 thinking
 about
 a
 lot


is
 looking
 at
 looking
 at
 OpenAI.
 Um


because,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 sort
 of


fascinated
 by
 disconnections
 and
 we've


got
 this
 interesting
 disconnect
 now,


which
 is
 that,
 you
 know, if
 you
 look
 at


the
 benchmark
 scores,
 so
 you've
 got


these
 general
 purpose
 benchmarks
 where


the
 models
 are
 basically
 all
 the
 same


and
 if
 you're
 Yes.
 If
 you're
 spending


hours
 a
 day
 in
 them,
 then
 you've
 got


this
 opinion
 about,
 oh,
 I
 like
 Claude's


tone
 of
 voice
 more
 than
 I
 like
 GBT
 and
 I


like
 GBT
 5.1
 more
 than
 GBT
 4.9
 or


whatever
 the
 hell
 it's
 called.
 If
 you're


using
 this
 once
 a
 week,
 you
 really
 don't


notice
 this
 stuff.
 And
 the
 benchmark


scores
 are
 all
 roughly
 the
 same.
 And
 but


the
 usage
 isn't.
 It's
 basically
 the
 only


consu
 Claude
 has
 basically
 no
 consumer


usage
 even
 though
 on
 the
 benchmark
 score


it's
 the
 same.
 and
 then
 it's
 chat
 GBT


and
 then
 halfway
 down
 the
 chart
 it's
 um


Meta
 and
 Google
 and
 the
 funny
 thing
 is


you
 know
 that
 you
 read
 all
 the
 AI


newsletters
 again
 then
 like
 Meta's
 lost


they're
 out
 of
 the
 game
 they're
 dead


Mark
 Zuckerberg
 is
 spending
 a
 billion


dollars
 a
 researcher
 to
 get
 back
 in
 the


game
 but
 from
 the
 consumer
 side
 well


it's
 it's
 distribution


and
 the
 interesting
 thing
 here
 is
 that


you've
 got
 what
 I'm
 kind
 of
 circling


around
 is
 if
 the
 model
 for
 a
 casual


consumer
 user
 certainly
 is
 a
 commodity


and
 there's
 no
 network
 effects
 or
 winner


takes
 all
 effects
 yet.
 There
 may
 those


may
 emerge
 but
 we
 don't
 have
 them
 yet.


And
 things
 like
 memory
 aren't
 network


effects
 as
 stickiness
 but
 they
 can
 be


copied.
 Um


how
 is
 it
 that
 you
 compete?
 Do
 you
 just


compete
 on
 being
 the
 recognized
 brand


and
 adding
 more
 features
 and
 services


and
 capabilities
 and
 people
 just
 don't


switch
 away?
 Which
 is
 kind
 of
 what


happened
 with
 Chrome
 for
 example.


There's
 not
 a
 network
 effect
 for
 Chrome,


but
 it
 and
 it's
 not
 actually
 any
 better


much.
 Maybe
 it's
 a
 bit
 better
 than


Safari,
 but
 you
 know,
 you
 use
 Chrome


because
 you
 use
 Chrome.


Or


is
 it
 that
 you
 get
 left
 behind
 on


distribution


or
 network
 effects
 that
 emerge
 somewhere


else


and
 meanwhile
 you
 don't
 have
 your
 own


infrastructure.
 So
 I
 suppose
 what
 I
 what


I'm
 getting
 at
 is
 like
 you've
 got
 these


8
 or
 900
 million
 weekly
 active
 users,


but
 you
 don't
 have
 but
 that
 feels
 very


fragile
 because
 all
 you've
 really
 got
 is


the
 power
 of
 the
 default
 and
 the
 brand.


You
 don't
 have
 a
 network
 effect.
 You


don't
 really
 have
 feature
 lock
 in.
 You


don't
 have
 a
 broader
 ecosystem.


You
 also
 don't
 have
 your
 own


infrastructure.
 So
 you
 don't
 control


your
 cost
 base.
 You
 don't
 have
 a
 cost


advantage.


You
 get
 a
 bill
 every
 month
 from
 Satcha.


Um,


so
 you've
 kind
 of
 got
 to
 scramble
 as


fast
 as
 you
 can
 in
 both
 of
 those


directions
 to
 on
 the
 one
 side
 build


product
 and
 build
 stuff
 that
 on
 top
 of


the
 model,
 which
 is
 our
 earlier


conversation.
 Is
 it
 just
 the
 model?


Yeah.


>> Now,
 you've
 got
 to
 build
 stuff
 on
 top
 of


the
 model
 in
 every
 direction.
 It's
 a


browser.
 It's
 a
 social
 video
 app.
 It's


an
 app
 platform.
 It's
 this.
 It's
 that.


It's
 like,
 you
 know,
 the
 meme
 of
 the
 guy


with
 the
 map
 with
 all
 the
 strings
 on
 it,


you
 know.
 Um
 it's
 all
 of
 these
 things.


We're
 going to
 build
 all
 of
 them


yesterday.
 And
 then
 in
 parallel
 it's


infrastructure
 like
 and
 you
 know
 we
 we


do
 we've
 got
 to
 deal
 with
 OpenAI
 sorry


deal
 with
 with
 Nvidia
 with
 with
 with


Broadcom
 with
 AMD
 with
 Nvidia
 with


Oracle
 and
 with
 petro
 dollars.
 Um


because
 you're
 kind
 of
 scrambling
 to
 get


from


this
 amazing
 technical
 breakthrough
 and


these
 800
 900
 million
 wows
 to
 something


that
 has
 like
 really
 sticky
 defensible


sustainable
 business
 value
 and
 product


value.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 so
 as
 you're
 evaluating


the
 the
 competitive
 landscape
 among
 the


the
 hyperscalers,
 what
 are
 the
 the


questions
 that
 you're
 ask
 that
 you
 think


are
 going to
 be
 most
 important
 in


determining
 um
 you
 know
 who
 who's
 going


to
 gain
 you
 know
 durable
 competitive


advantages
 or
 or
 how
 this
 competitive
 is


going
 to
 competition
 is
 going
 to
 play


out.
 Well,
 this
 kind
 of
 comes
 back
 to


your
 point
 about
 sustaining
 advantage


and
 we
 talked
 about
 Google
 like
 if
 we


think
 about
 the
 shift
 to
 particularly


shift
 to
 mobile
 for
 meta
 this
 turned
 out


to
 be
 transformative
 like
 it
 made
 the


products
 way
 more
 useful.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 for
 Google
 it
 turned
 out
 mobile


search
 is
 just
 search


>> and
 maps
 changed
 probably
 and
 YouTube


changed
 a
 bit
 but
 basically
 for
 Google


search
 Google
 search
 is
 search
 and
 the


web
 web
 search
 is
 just
 mean
 means
 more


people
 doing
 more
 search
 more
 more
 of


the
 time.
 Yeah.


>> Um,
 and


the
 default
 view
 now
 would
 seem
 to
 be,


well,
 Gemini
 is
 as
 good
 as
 anybody
 else.


Next
 week,
 like
 the
 new
 model,
 I
 haven't


looked
 at
 the
 benchmarks
 for
 GPT
 5.1,


which
 is
 out
 today.
 Is
 it
 better
 than


Gemini?
 Probably.
 Will
 it
 still
 be


better
 next
 month?
 No.


So,
 that's
 a
 given.
 Like,
 you've
 got
 a


Frontier
 model.
 Fine.
 What
 does
 that


cost?
 It
 costs
 you,
 pick
 a
 number,
 $250


billion
 a
 year,
 $100
 billion
 a
 year.


What's
 this?
 This
 is
 our
 earlier


conversation
 about
 capex.
 Okay.
 So,


Google
 can
 pay
 that
 because
 they've
 got


the
 money.
 They've
 got
 they've
 got
 the


cash
 rate
 from
 everything
 else.
 And
 so,


you
 do
 that
 and
 your
 existing
 products


get
 you
 optimize
 search.
 You
 optimize


your
 ad
 business.
 You
 build,
 you
 know,


you
 build
 new
 experiences.
 Maybe
 you


invent
 the
 new
 the
 iPhone
 of
 AI.
 Maybe


there
 is
 no
 iPhone
 of
 AI.
 Maybe
 someone


else
 does
 it
 and
 you
 do
 an
 Android
 and


just
 copy
 it.
 Um,


so
 fine,
 it's
 the
 new
 mobile.
 We'll
 just


carry
 on.
 Search
 is
 search.
 AI
 is
 AI.


We'll
 do
 the
 new
 thing.
 We'll
 make
 it
 a


feature.
 We'll
 just
 carry
 on
 doing
 it.


Um,
 for
 meta,
 it
 feels
 like
 there
 are


bigger
 questions
 on
 what
 this
 means
 for


search.
 Um,
 or
 what
 it
 means
 for
 content


and
 social
 and
 experience
 and


recommendation,
 which
 makes
 it
 all
 that


more
 imperative
 that
 they
 have
 their
 own


models
 just
 as
 it
 is
 for
 Google.
 Um,
 for


Amazon.
 Okay.
 Well,
 on
 the
 one
 side,


it's
 commodity
 infra
 and
 we'll
 sell
 it


as
 commodity
 infra.
 And
 on
 the
 other


side,
 and
 maybe
 can
 maybe
 step
 maybe


step
 back.
 If
 you're
 not
 a
 hyperscaler,


if
 you're
 a
 web
 publisher,
 a
 marketer,
 a


brand,
 an
 advertiser,
 a
 media
 company,


you
 could
 make
 a
 list
 of
 questions,
 but


like
 you
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 the


questions
 are
 right
 now.


>> What
 is
 this?
 What
 happens
 if
 I
 ask
 a


chatbot
 a
 thing
 instead
 of
 asking


Google?
 Even
 if
 it's
 Google
 from
 from


Google's
 point
 of
 view,
 well,
 I'll
 ask


Google's
 chatbot.
 It's
 fine.
 But
 as
 a


marketer,
 what
 does
 that
 mean?
 What


happens
 if
 I
 ask
 for
 a
 recipe
 and
 the


LLM
 just
 gives
 me
 the
 answer?
 What
 does


that
 mean
 if
 my
 business
 is
 having


recipes?


>> Yeah.


>> Do
 you
 have
 a
 kind
 of
 split
 between,
 and


this
 is
 also
 an
 Amazon
 question,
 how


does
 a
 purchasing
 decision
 happen?
 How


does
 this
 decision
 to
 buy
 a
 thing
 that
 I


didn't
 know
 existed
 before
 happen?
 What


happens
 if
 I
 wave
 my
 phone
 at
 my
 living


room
 and
 say,
 "What
 should
 I
 buy?
 Where


does
 that
 take
 me?"
 In
 ways
 that
 it


wouldn't
 have
 taken
 me
 in
 the
 past.
 So


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 questions
 further


downstream
 and
 that
 goes
 upstream
 to


Meta
 and
 to
 some
 extent
 for
 Google.
 It's


a
 much
 bigger
 question
 in
 the
 long
 term


for
 Amazon.
 Do
 do
 LLM
 mean
 that
 Amazon


can
 finally
 do
 really
 good
 at
 scale


recommendation
 and
 discovery
 and


suggestion
 in
 ways
 that
 it
 couldn't


really
 do
 in
 the
 past
 um
 because
 of
 this


kind
 of
 pure
 commodity
 retailing
 model


that
 it
 has.
 Um,
 Apple
 Apple's
 sort
 of


off
 on
 one
 side.
 You
 know,


interestingly,
 they
 produced
 this


incredibly
 compelling
 vision
 of
 what


Siri
 should
 be
 two
 years
 ago.
 It
 just


turned
 out
 that
 they
 couldn't
 make
 it.


Interestingly,
 nobody
 else
 could
 have


made
 it
 either.
 You
 go
 back
 and
 watch


the
 Siri
 demo
 that
 they
 gave
 and
 you


think,
 okay,
 so
 we've
 got
 multimodal


instantaneous
 ondevice
 tool
 using


agentic
 multiplatform
 e-commerce
 in
 real


time
 with
 no
 prompt
 injection
 problems


and
 zero
 error
 rates.
 Well,
 that
 sounds


good.


I
 mean,
 has
 anyone
 got
 that
 working?


Like,
 no.
 Open
 eye
 open
 Google
 and
 Open


AI
 don't
 have
 that
 working.
 I
 Google
 I


don't
 think
 Google
 or
 OpenAI
 could


deliver
 the
 Siri
 demo
 that
 Apple
 gave


two
 years
 ago.
 I
 mean,
 they
 could


probably
 do
 the
 demo,
 but
 they
 couldn't


like
 consistently
 reliably
 make
 it
 work.


I
 mean,
 that
 that
 demo
 that
 product


isn't
 in
 Android
 today.
 Um
 and
 Apple
 I


mean
 Apple
 to
 me
 has
 the
 most
 kind
 of


intellectually
 interesting
 question


which
 is
 um


so
 I
 saw
 Craig
 Craig
 Federigi
 make
 this


point
 which
 is
 like
 we
 don't
 have
 our


own
 chatbot
 fine
 we
 also
 don't
 have


YouTube
 or
 Uber


what
 what
 explain
 why
 that
 is
 different


which
 is
 a
 harder
 question
 to
 answer


than
 it
 sounds
 like
 um
 and
 of
 course
 the


answer
 is
 if
 this
 actually
 fundamentally


changed
 the
 nature
 of
 computing
 then


it's
 a
 problem
 if
 it's
 just
 a
 service


that
 you
 use
 like
 Google
 then
 that's
 not


a
 problem.
 Um
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 point


about
 about
 you
 know
 where
 does
 Siri
 go.


But
 the
 interesting
 counter
 example
 here


would
 be
 to
 think
 about
 what
 happened
 to


Microsoft
 in
 the
 2000s
 which
 is
 the


entire
 dev
 environment
 gets
 away
 from


them
 and
 no
 one
 builds
 Windows
 apps


after
 like
 2001
 or
 something
 but
 you


need
 to
 use
 the
 internet.
 To
 use
 the


internet
 you
 need
 a
 PC
 and
 what
 PC
 are


you
 going
 to
 buy?
 Well
 like
 Apple's
 like


not
 really
 a
 player
 at
 that
 time
 and


just
 getting
 back
 into
 the
 game.
 Linux


is
 obviously
 not
 an
 option
 for
 any


normal
 person.
 Um,
 so
 you
 buy
 Windows


PC.
 So
 basically
 Microsoft
 loses
 the


platform
 war
 and
 sells
 an
 order
 of


magnitude
 more
 PCs
 like
 well
 not
 selling


them
 but
 order
 an
 order
 of
 magnitude


more
 Windows
 PCs
 as
 a
 result
 of
 this


thing
 that
 Microsoft
 lost.
 Um,
 and
 then


it
 takes
 until
 mobile
 that
 like
 then


they
 lose
 the
 device
 as
 well
 as
 a


development
 development
 environment.
 So


here's
 this
 kind
 of
 question
 is
 if
 all


the
 new
 stuff
 is
 built
 on
 AI
 and
 I'm


accessing
 an
 app
 that
 I
 download
 from


the
 app
 store,
 to
 what
 extent
 is
 this
 a


problem
 for
 Apple?


And
 what
 would
 have
 to
 you
 would
 need
 a


much
 more
 fundamental
 shift
 in
 what
 it


was
 that
 was
 happening
 for
 that
 to
 be
 a


problem
 for
 Apple.
 And
 even
 if
 you
 take


like
 the
 you
 know
 not
 the
 like
 the
 full


like
 the
 rapture
 arrives
 and
 we
 all
 just


kind
 of
 go
 and
 live
 sleep
 in
 pods
 like


the
 guys
 in
 up.
 Um
 not
 up.
 Um
 yes
 what


is
 it?
 The
 one
 with
 the
 robot
 that's


capturing
 the
 trash.
 Which
 one
 is
 that?


>> Wally.


>> Wall-ally.
 Wally.
 Yeah.
 You
 know
 the


guys
 in
 the
 pods
 in
 that
 movie.
 Maybe


we'll
 be
 the
 people.
 Maybe
 we'll
 be
 like


that.
 In
 which
 case
 fine.
 Um,
 but
 like


there's
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 midc
 case
 which
 is


like
 the
 whole
 nature
 of
 software


changes
 and
 there
 are
 no
 apps
 anymore


and
 you
 just
 go
 and
 ask
 the
 LLM
 a
 thing.


Fine.
 What
 is
 the
 device
 on
 which
 you


ask
 the
 LLM
 a
 thing?
 Well,
 it's
 probably


going
 to
 have
 a
 nice
 big
 color
 screen


and
 it's
 probably
 going
 to
 have
 like
 a


one
 day
 battery
 life.
 Probably
 needs
 a


microphone.
 Probably
 a
 good
 camera.


Kind
 of
 sounds
 like
 an
 iPhone.


>> Yeah.


Am
 I
 going
 to
 buy
 the
 one
 that's
 a
 tenth


of
 the
 price
 and
 just
 use
 the
 LLM
 on
 it?


No,
 because
 I'll
 still
 want
 the
 good


camera
 and
 this
 good
 screen
 and
 the
 good


battery
 life.
 So,
 it's
 not
 there's
 a


bunch
 of
 kind
 of
 interesting
 strategic


questions
 when
 you
 start
 poking
 away.


Well,
 what
 does
 this
 mean
 for
 Amazon?


Those
 are
 completely
 different
 questions


to
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 for
 Google
 or
 what


does
 it
 mean
 for
 Apple?
 What
 does
 it


mean
 to
 Facebook
 or
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 to


Salesforce?
 What
 does
 it
 mean
 to
 you


know
 Uber?
 And
 then
 right
 back
 to
 what


we
 were
 saying
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 this


conversation
 you
 know
 what
 does
 this


mean
 for
 Uber?


Well
 their
 efficients
 get
 operations
 get


X%
 more
 efficient
 and
 now
 the
 for


detection
 works
 and
 you
 know
 okay
 maybe


they're
 autonomous
 cars
 different


conversation
 but
 presume
 no
 autonomous


cars.
 That's
 a whole
 other
 conversation.


Otherwise
 as
 Uber
 what
 does
 this
 change?


Well


not
 a
 huge
 amount.
 I
 want
 to
 sort
 of


zoom
 out
 a
 little
 bit.
 This
 help
 framing


the
 um


>> so
 you've
 been
 doing
 these
 presentations


for
 a
 while
 now.
 You,
 you
 know,
 you


bumped
 them
 up
 to
 two
 times
 um
 because


there's
 so
 much
 is
 changing.
 Um
 and
 and


one
 of
 the
 things
 you
 do
 in
 each


presentation
 is
 is
 you're
 famous
 for


asking,
 you
 know,
 really
 great
 questions


and
 chronicling
 what
 what
 are
 the


important
 questions
 to
 to
 be
 asking.
 I'm


I'm
 curious
 as
 you
 reflect,
 you
 know,


maybe
 post
 uh
 you
 know,
 CHGBT
 in
 2022
 or


GBT3
 rather.
 um
 the
 questions
 you
 were


asking
 then
 and
 you
 reflect
 on
 to
 now
 uh


to
 what
 extent
 uh
 do
 we
 have
 some


direction
 on
 some
 of
 those
 questions
 or


to
 what
 extent
 are
 they
 the
 same


questions
 or
 or
 new
 and
 and
 and


different
 questions
 or
 what
 is
 sort
 of


your
 you
 know
 if
 I
 woke
 up
 on
 a
 in
 a


coma
 after
 reading
 your
 you
 know
 your


original
 presentation
 let's
 say
 you
 the


one
 after
 GPT
 uh
 3
 launch
 came
 out
 um


and
 then
 seeing
 this
 one
 now
 what
 were


the
 sort
 of
 most
 surprising
 things
 or


things
 that
 we
 we
 we
 learned
 that


updated
 those
 questions.


>> So
 I
 think
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 new


questions
 this
 year.


So
 I
 feel
 like
 you
 know
 you
 could
 make
 a


list
 of
 as
 it
 might
 be
 half
 a
 dozen


questions
 in
 spring
 of
 23


like
 open
 source
 China
 Nvidia


does
 scaling
 continue


um
 what
 happens
 to
 images
 um
 does
 how


long
 does
 open
 AI's
 lead
 remain
 and


those
 questions
 didn't
 really
 change
 in


23
 and
 24
 and
 most
 of
 those
 questions


are
 kind
 of
 still
 there
 like
 the
 Nvidia


question
 hasn't
 really
 changed
 you
 know


the
 answer
 on
 ch
 the
 answer
 on
 you
 know


will
 how
 models
 will
 there
 be?
 The


answer
 is
 okay,
 there's
 going
 to
 be


anybody
 who
 can
 spend
 a
 couple
 of


hundred
 can
 spend
 a
 couple
 of
 billion


dollars
 can
 have
 a
 frontier
 model.
 That


was
 pretty
 obvious
 in
 early
 23.
 Um
 it


took
 a
 while
 for
 everyone
 to
 understand


that.
 And
 big
 models
 and
 small
 models,


will
 we
 have
 small
 models
 running
 on


devices?
 No,
 because
 the
 small
 models


the
 capabilities
 keep
 moving
 too
 fast


for
 the
 small
 models
 to
 shrink
 the
 small


model
 onto
 the
 device.
 But
 those


questions
 kind
 of
 didn't
 change
 for
 two


two
 and
 a
 half
 years.
 I
 think
 we
 now


have
 I
 think
 a
 bunch
 of
 more
 product


strategy
 questions
 as
 you
 see
 real


consumer
 adoption
 and
 open
 AI
 and
 Google


building
 stuff
 in
 different
 directions,


Amazon
 going
 in
 different
 directions,


Apple
 trying
 and
 obviously
 failing
 and


then
 then
 trying
 again
 to
 do
 stuff.


There's
 some
 sense
 of
 like
 there
 is


something
 more
 going
 on
 in
 the
 industry


than
 just
 well
 let's
 just
 build
 another


model
 and
 spend
 more
 money.


>> Yeah,


>> there's
 more
 questions
 and
 more


decisions.
 Now
 there's
 also
 more


questions
 outside
 of
 tech
 in
 certainly


on
 like
 the
 retail
 media
 side
 of
 um
 how


do
 you
 start
 thinking
 about


what
 you
 would
 do
 with
 this?
 And
 again,


you
 know,
 classic
 framing
 in
 my
 deck
 is


like
 step
 one
 is
 you
 make
 it
 a
 feature


and
 you
 absorb
 it
 and
 you
 do
 the
 obvious


stuff.
 Step
 two
 is
 you
 do
 new
 stuff.


Step
 three
 is
 maybe
 someone
 will
 come


and
 pull
 the
 whole
 industry
 inside
 out


and
 completely
 redefine
 the
 question.


And
 so
 you
 could
 kind
 of
 do
 like
 an


imagine
 if
 here
 of
 like
 step
 one
 is
 um


you
 know
 you're
 you're
 a
 manager
 at
 a


Walmart
 in
 the
 Bay
 Area
 or
 DC
 or
 like


whatever
 it
 is.
 Step
 one
 is
 find
 me
 that


metric.
 Step
 two
 is
 build
 me
 a


dashboard.
 Step
 three
 is
 it's
 Black


Friday
 and
 I'm
 running
 managing
 a


Walmart
 outside
 of
 DC.
 What
 should
 I
 be


worried
 about?


like
 and
 that
 might
 be
 the
 wrong
 one
 but


it's
 like
 you
 know
 step
 one
 for
 Amazon


is
 you
 bought
 light
 bulbs
 so
 here's
 so


you
 bought
 bubble
 wrap
 so
 here's
 some


packing
 tape
 but
 what
 Amazon
 should


actually
 be
 doing
 is
 saying
 hm
 say
 this


person
 is
 moving
 home
 we'll
 show
 them
 a


home
 insurance
 ad
 which
 is
 something


that
 Amazon's
 correlation
 systems


wouldn't
 get
 because
 they
 wouldn't
 have


that
 in
 their
 purchasing
 data


and
 we're
 still
 very
 much
 at
 the
 like


we're
 still
 starting
 to
 we're
 still
 on


the
 step
 one
 of
 that
 but
 thinking
 much


more.
 What
 would
 the
 step
 two,
 step


three
 be?
 What
 would
 new
 revenue
 be
 for


this
 other
 than
 just
 like
 simple
 dumb


automation?


What
 would
 new
 things
 that
 we
 would


build
 with
 this
 be?
 Um,
 where
 would
 this


actually
 like
 might
 I
 might might


actually
 kind
 of
 redefine
 or
 change
 what


the
 market
 might
 look
 like?
 Um,
 and


that's
 obviously
 a
 big
 question
 for


anyone
 in
 content
 business.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 know,
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 if
 I
 can


just
 go
 and
 ask
 an
 LLM
 this
 question?


What
 kinds
 of
 content
 were
 predicated
 on


Google
 rooting
 that
 question
 to
 you?
 And


what
 kind
 of
 questions
 what
 kind
 of


content
 isn't
 really
 that
 question?
 Like


do
 I
 want
 a
 Bologn
 recipe
 or
 do
 I
 want


to
 hear
 Stanley
 Tucci
 talking
 about


cooking
 in
 Italy?
 Like
 do
 I
 just
 want


the
 do
 I
 want
 that
 skew
 or
 do
 I
 want
 to


work
 out
 which
 product
 I
 should
 buy?


Which
 is
 Amazon
 is
 great
 at
 getting
 you


the
 skew.
 terrible
 at
 telling
 you
 what


ski
 you
 want.
 Um,
 do
 I
 just
 want
 the


slide
 deck
 or
 do
 I
 want
 to
 spend
 a
 week


talking
 to
 a
 bunch
 of
 partners
 from
 Bane


about
 how
 I
 could
 think
 about
 doing


this?
 Do
 I
 just
 want
 money
 or
 do
 I
 want


to
 work
 with
 A16Z's


um,
 you
 know,
 operating
 groups?


>> Like
 what
 is
 it
 that
 I'm
 doing
 here?
 And


I
 think
 the
 the
 LLM
 is
 starting
 thing
 is


starting
 to
 crystallize
 that
 question
 in


lots
 of
 different
 ways.
 Yeah,


>> like
 what
 am
 I
 actually
 trying
 to
 do


here?
 Do
 I
 just
 want
 a
 thing
 that
 a


computer
 can
 now
 answer
 for
 me
 or
 do
 I


want
 something
 else
 that
 isn't?
 Because


the
 LMS
 can
 do
 a
 bunch
 of
 stuff
 that


computers
 couldn't
 do
 before,


>> right?


>> Is
 that
 thing
 that
 the
 computer
 couldn't


do
 before
 my
 business?


>> Yeah.


>> Or
 am
 I
 actually
 doing
 something
 else?


>> We're
 we're
 about
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 is


the
 in
 a
 much
 more
 granular
 way
 what


what
 is
 the
 true
 job
 to
 be
 done
 for
 for


for
 many
 many
 of
 these
 uh


>> Yeah.
 And
 you
 know
 going
 back
 to
 the


internet
 there
 was
 you
 know
 the
 sort
 of


observation
 about
 newspapers
 is
 that


newspapers
 looked
 on
 the
 internet
 and


they
 talked
 about
 you
 know
 expertise
 and


curation
 and
 journalism
 and
 everything


else
 and
 didn't
 really
 say
 well
 we're
 a


light
 manufacturing
 company
 and
 a
 local


distribution
 and
 trucking
 company.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 that
 was
 the
 bit
 that
 was
 the


problem
 and
 until
 the
 internet
 arrived


like
 that
 wasn't
 a
 conversation
 you


thought
 about
 and
 then
 the
 internet


suddenly
 makes
 that
 clear
 and
 suddenly


creates
 an
 unbundling
 that
 didn't
 exist


before.
 And
 so
 there
 will
 be
 those
 kinds


of
 like
 you
 didn't
 realize
 you
 were
 that


before
 until
 an
 LLM
 comes
 along
 and


points
 to
 someone
 comes
 along
 with
 an


LLM
 and
 says
 I
 can
 use
 this
 to
 do
 this


thing
 that
 you
 didn't
 really
 realize
 was


the
 basis
 of
 your
 defensibility
 or
 the


basis
 of
 your
 profitability.
 I
 mean
 it's


like
 the
 you
 know
 the
 the
 the
 joke
 about


you
 know
 US
 health
 insurance
 that
 like


the
 basis
 of
 US
 health
 insurance


profitability
 is
 making
 it
 really
 really


boring
 and
 difficult
 and
 timeconuming.


That's
 where
 the
 profits
 come
 from.


Maybe
 it
 isn't.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 know


that
 industry,
 but
 for
 the
 sake
 of


argument,
 say
 that's
 that's
 your


defensibility.
 Well,
 an
 LLM
 removes


boring,
 time-consuming,
 mind-numbing


tasks.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 what
 industries
 are
 protected
 by


having
 that?
 And
 they
 didn't
 realize


that.
 And
 these,
 you
 know,
 it's
 like
 you


could
 have
 asked
 these
 questions
 about


the
 internet
 in
 the
 mid
 '90s
 or
 about


mobile
 a
 decade
 later.
 And
 generally,


you'd
 have
 half
 of
 the
 questions
 you'd


have
 asked
 would
 have
 been
 the
 wrong


questions
 in
 hindsight.
 I
 mean,
 I


remember
 as
 a
 as
 a
 baby
 analyst
 in
 2000,


everyone
 kept
 saying,
 "What's
 the
 killer


use
 case
 for
 3G?


What's
 a
 good
 use
 case
 for
 3G?"
 And
 it


turned
 out
 that
 having
 the
 internet
 in


your
 pocket
 everywhere
 was
 the
 use
 case


for
 3G.


>> But
 that
 wasn't
 the
 question
 that
 people


were
 asking.
 And
 I'm
 sure
 that
 will
 be


the
 thing
 now


is
 there's
 so
 much
 that
 we
 will
 that


will
 happen
 and
 get
 built
 where
 you
 go


and
 you
 realize,
 oh,


that's
 how
 you
 would
 do
 this.
 you
 can


turn
 it
 into
 that.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I'm
 sure
 you've
 had
 this
 experience


seeing
 entrepreneurs.
 You
 you
 know,
 you


get
 every
 now
 and
 then
 they
 come
 in
 and


they
 pitch
 the
 thing.
 You're
 like,
 "Oh,


okay.
 You
 can
 turn
 it
 into
 that.
 It


didn't
 I
 didn't
 realize
 it
 was
 that."


>> Yeah.
 No,
 100%.
 My
 my
 last
 question
 to


get
 you
 out
 of
 here
 is
 um
 if
 if
 we're


talking
 two
 or
 three
 years
 from
 now
 or


you
 you're
 doing
 a
 presentation,
 you


say,
 "Oh,
 this
 is
 actually
 bigger
 than


the
 internet
 or
 may
 maybe
 this
 is
 like


like
 computing."
 Um
 what
 would
 need
 to


be
 true?
 What
 what
 would
 need
 to
 happen?


What
 what
 would
 uh
 what
 would
 evolve
 our


thinking?


>> I
 mean
 I
 I
 kind
 of
 you
 know
 sort
 of
 come


back
 to
 my
 point
 about
 you
 know
 the
 Jews


and
 Christians
 like
 the
 Messiah
 came


nothing
 happened.
 Um,


we
 forget
 I
 mean
 there's
 maybe
 two
 two


ways
 very
 brief
 ways
 to
 think
 about


this.
 One
 of
 them
 is
 I
 think
 we
 forget


how
 enormous
 the
 iPhone
 was
 and
 how


enormous
 the
 internet
 was.
 And
 you
 can


still
 find
 people
 in
 tech
 who
 claim
 that


smartphones
 aren't
 a
 big
 deal.


And
 this
 was
 the
 basis
 of
 people


complaining
 about
 me
 like
 this
 idiot.
 He


thinks
 like
 generative
 AI
 is
 big
 as


those
 silly
 phone
 things.
 Like


come
 on.
 I
 think
 another
 answer
 would
 be


like


I
 don't
 want
 to
 get
 into
 the
 argument


about
 you
 know
 what
 is
 the
 grace
 rating


capability
 and
 benchmarks
 and
 and
 all


you
 know
 you
 see
 lots
 of
 5hour
 long


podcasts
 of
 people
 talking
 about
 this


stuff
 but
 the
 stuff
 we
 have
 now
 is
 not
 a


replacement
 for
 an
 actual
 person


outside
 of
 some
 very
 narrow
 and
 very


tightly
 constrained
 guard
 rails
 which
 is


why
 you
 know
 Demis's
 point
 that
 it's


absurd
 to
 say
 that
 we
 have
 PhD
 level


capabilities
 now.
 Um


what
 we
 would
 have
 to
 be
 seeing


something
 that
 would
 really
 shift
 our


perception
 of
 the
 capability
 of
 this


stuff.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 that
 it's
 actually
 a
 person
 as


opposed
 to
 it
 can
 kind
 of
 do
 these


people
 like
 things
 really
 well
 sometimes


but
 not
 other
 times.
 And
 it's
 a,
 you


know,
 it's
 a
 very
 tough
 conceptual


kind
 of
 thing
 to
 think
 about
 because,


you
 know,
 I'm
 I'm
 deliberate.
 I'm
 I'm


conscious
 I'm
 not
 giving
 you
 a


falsifiable
 answer.
 But
 I'm
 not
 sure


what
 a
 falsifiable
 answer
 would
 be
 to


that.
 When
 would
 you
 know
 whether
 this


was
 AGI?
 You
 know,
 it's
 the
 Larry
 Tesla


line.
 AI
 is
 whatever
 doesn't
 work
 yet.


As
 people,
 as
 soon
 as
 people
 say
 it


works,
 people
 say,
 "Well,
 that's
 just


not
 AI.
 That's
 just
 software."


It's
 a,
 you
 know,
 it's
 a
 it's
 an
 and
 it


becomes
 like
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 slightly
 drunk


philosoph
 philosophy
 grad
 student
 kind


of
 conversation
 as
 much
 as
 it
 is
 a


technology
 conversation.
 Like
 what
 would


it
 have
 you
 ever
 considered,
 Eric,
 that


>> maybe
 we're
 not
 either.


>> That's
 a
 thought.
 It's
 I
 I
 all
 I
 can
 say


to
 give
 a
 tangible
 answer
 to
 this


question
 is
 what
 we
 have
 right
 now
 isn't


that.
 Will
 it
 grow
 to
 that?
 We
 don't


know.
 You
 may
 believe
 it
 will.
 I
 can't


tell
 you
 that
 you're
 wrong.
 We'll
 just


have
 to
 find
 out.


>> I
 think
 that's
 a
 good
 place
 to
 to
 to


wrap.
 The
 the
 presentation
 is
 AI
 use
 the


world.
 We
 we'll
 link
 to
 it.
 It's


fantastic.
 Benedict,
 thanks
 so
 much
 for


coming
 on
 the
 podcast
 to
 discuss
 it.


>> Sure.
 Thanks
 a
 lot.
 Heat. Heat.
