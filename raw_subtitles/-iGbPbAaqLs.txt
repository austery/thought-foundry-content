You've never seen a school like this.
In the middle of the Brooklyn Navy Yard,
surrounded by cranes,
start-ups, design studios,
young people aren't just
sitting in classrooms.
They're creating digital
marketing campaigns for small businesses,
wiring real houses.
Down the hall,
a student named Natalia
is hacking websites, safely,
with the guidance of cybersecurity pros.
(Laughter)
These students are part
of the Brooklyn Steam Center,
a public high school
that looks and feels
more like an engineering studio
than a traditional classroom.
They're earning college-ready
diplomas and industry credentials.
They're building professional networks
while discovering what
they're good at in the real world.
And none of it happened by accident.
I lead a school design
organization called Transcend.
And when we began working
with the Brooklyn community,
our first step wasn't
to bring in a program.
It was to listen.
Students, families,
educators, local employers
all told us the same thing:
we want learning that actually
connects to the world
kids are growing into.
So with the school's founders,
we stitched together decades
of practice and research,
career-connected learning,
project-based learning,
purpose development.
The result?
A learning experience that's rigorous,
relevant and engaging.
Not about regurgitating content
but about solving real problems.
Not "What do I need to know for the test?"
But "What can I build that matters?"
And when you see it, it feels obvious.
Of course, school should be like this.
But if it's so obvious,
why am I on this stage
telling you about it?
And what does it cost us
when most students
never get to learn this way?
Transcend recently surveyed
70,000 students across the US.
Less than half said they loved school.
Two thirds said it's boring.
Less than four percent said
they get a chance to explore
and be in charge of their own learning.
And the older students get,
the worse it gets.
Nearly three quarters of third-graders
say they love school,
but by high school,
barely a quarter say they do.
And the data is just telling us
what every parent already knows.
You ask,
"How was school today?"
And you hear one word.
"Fine."
But "fine" isn't fine.
It's the sound of potential
quietly fading.
Here's the truth most of us
don't say out loud.
School isn't broken.
It's doing exactly
what it was designed to do
over a century ago.
It was built for the factory age
to standardize, sort
and prepare young people
for predictable jobs.
It worked for the time.
Literacy rose, the middle class grew.
But today, our graduates
aren't heading to assembly lines.
They're stepping into a world
being reshaped by AI,
where thriving depends
on knowing who you are,
discerning fact from fiction,
knowing how to keep learning, creating,
collaborating and, indeed,
co-existing with others.
That's why I believe our task
isn't merely to improve schools,
it's to redesign them for a new purpose.
A purpose worthy of the 15,000 hours
every young person spends
in K-12 schooling.
A purpose that shapes our very democracy.
Because, as my mentor puts it,
what happens in classrooms today
is what will happen in society tomorrow.
But realizing this vision
has never been easy.
For decades, we've been trapped
between two extremes:
top-down reforms
that can ignore local realities
or bottom-up efforts that often depend
on heroic and exhausted educators.
But there's a third way.
Community-based design.
Community-based design
takes the best of both approaches.
It brings together the wisdom
of lived experience
with the wisdom of research.
The assets of communities
with the assets of proven
tools and practices
to make change that's both
human and enduring.
It's the best of design thinking,
R and D, and community participation
applied to the life of a school.
That's how Brooklyn Steam came to be.
It's also how Van Ness Elementary
in Washington, DC
redesigned school around a simple idea.
Kids learn best when they feel seen.
We brought together families, educators,
district leaders
to imagine school that truly
centered the whole child.
Nurturing mind, body and relationships
while confronting the real trauma
that many students carried into school.
So we integrated effective
practices from other settings.
Morning circles replaced roll call,
mindfulness breaks
alongside rigorous lessons,
measures on student belonging
that matter as much as test scores do.
After months of piloting and iterating,
these pieces came together
into a coherent model
where every student feels safe, connected
and ready to learn.
When I visited,
I saw a seven-year-old named Jalissa
who had an emotional outburst
in the classroom.
Her friend Amara gently guided her
to a calming space
where they practiced breathing together.
Within minutes, Jalissa was back on track.
No tension, no punishment,
just learning for both of them.
That's why, even as other DC schools
issued dozens or more
suspensions each year,
Van Ness issued none
and exceeded district averages
in reading and math.
Today, one in four DC elementary schools
is adopting this approach,
and it's spreading to more
than 100 schools across the country.
Yeah.
(Applause)
And community-based design works in places
that couldn't be more different.
It's how Matthew, a high school senior
in rural North Dakota,
went from dozing through class
to forging his own path
in every sense of the word,
after discovering blacksmithing.
His school was ready
because it had been redesigned
around real-world learning,
he had the structure and freedom
to turn his curiosity into craft,
applying math, science and design
to building a small business of his own.
Now imagine pairing community-based design
with today's technology.
AI can help us accelerate learning
and facilitate immersive experiences
that spark every student's passion
so that thousands more Matthews
can find their purpose.
If we design on purpose.
From Brooklyn to DC to North Dakota,
in 500 schools across the country,
we've seen what happens
when communities design learning
around how young people
actually learn and live.
When you put student experience,
engagement, motivation,
in the center,
not as a bonus,
but as a driving principle,
everything changes.
The data backs it up.
Students who experience engaging,
high-quality learning have higher grades,
stronger attendance,
fewer behavior issues.
But the magic isn't in the numbers.
It’s in the spark you see
when a student realizes:
"I belong here,"
"I can do this,"
"I'm learning with purpose."
"I can make something that matters."
I know I want that for my own kids.
And of course, I'm not alone.
Every parent, educator, every community
wants schools that keep growing
with the world around them.
School cannot be something
we redesign once a century.
We need community-based
design as a muscle,
not a program or an initiative.
Something built in, not bolted on.
A continuous way of evolving
how we do school together.
So when we ask,
"And how are the children?"
Let’s make sure the answer isn’t “fine.”
Let it be, "They're engaged,
they're thriving,
and they're transforming the world."
Thank you.
(Cheers and applause)
