There
is a cyclical element to fraud, right?
Because in good times
people will look the other way.
And I don't I don't think it's cyclical.
I think it's always there.
I just think,
you know, the who's that said it,
you know, when the when the water goes out
you can figure out is swimming nude.
I think it was buffet. Buffet. Yeah. Yeah.
Well Galbraith's
however talked about the bezzle.
Right.
The, the the propensity of flimflam
and scams to exist during the good times
and people just like,
and that accumulates and accumulates.
But that could be.
We've had like 20 years, as you said, like
we haven't had a credit.
I mean, we're it's almost 20 years
since the financial crisis now.
Yeah.
The finance always finds its way,
finds a way to blow itself up.
I mean, it's it's yeah, I mean, it's,
you know, it's it's not an opinion.
And just look at history.
I think what happens is you get you get,
you know, we find good things
and then you ride them and you. Yeah.
In every instance
where something's gone wrong,
you just keep pushing on something
till you take it over the edge.
Right. Finances.
An industry where historically
you could make a lot of money at it.
Right?
You're playing with other people's money,
you know,
pennies and nickels
coming off of other people's money.
I'm just going to keep pushing. I'm
going to keep pushing and keep pushing.
When it finally falls, it falls hard.
Hello
and welcome to another episode of the Odd
Lots podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal. And I'm Tracy Alloway.
So Tracy, one of the motifs,
I guess, of some of our recent.
Motif is a. Good word. It's
a good word, isn't it? Thank you.
One of the motifs
of some of our recent conversations,
and also,
I guess one of the megatrends of our time
is this idea of just like
scale is a competitive advantage.
Size returns to size, returns to scale.
The ability of someone to,
like pick up a phone and say,
I need a lot of money right now.
And the advantage
that accrues to financial players
is we see it across a lot of sectors.
But it really it stands out a lot
in our finance conversations.
It feels good to be big in business,
right?
Like once you get big,
you have all this competitive advantage
that allows you to get bigger.
The place where this is most noticeable,
I would argue,
and it's been this way for a while,
is the banking industry right?
Like the long run trend among U.S.
banks is the big get bigger.
And we've all seen those charts
of like all the little banks
that compose Bank of America or JP Morgan.
I love those charts. I do too.
And that's the direction
the industry seems to be heading, right?
Right.
It's so interesting to me
to like to think about, like,
these are an analog to tech
because it's the same in tech, right?
If you look at big tech
and we talk about the mag seven, etc.,
they've really outperformed middle tech
or small tech.
It is truly incredible.
And we have intuitive reasons
for understanding of that network
effects lock and and so forth.
And it's so fascinating
that some of our story that we tell
must be a little bit insufficient,
because we see the same story replicated
as, as we're talking about, with banks
and with banks,
it seems to be a couple of fold as like
one is balance sheet capacity, right?
And the ability to do big deals
and so forth.
And then of course, there's
the other thing, which is just like
the sort of the menu of services
that you can offer, right?
If you're a big bank. Right.
And also just the fact that you have,
well,
balance sheet, you have a lot of money.
So for juicy deal comes up,
you can deploy it quite quickly
and you get like first dibs
on issuance, which has been good
in the recent credit market.
So we haven't done like a ton of pure
banking episodes or the we've done some.
But, you know,
we did the most probably right in the wake
of, Silicon Valley Bank, obviously.
And we talked about like, the challenges
of some of the community banks
or the sort of smaller
regional banks, etc., and then we know,
like the huge scale of,
like the JP morgan's of the world,
but also like, what about the banks?
And just sort of like some JP
Morgan scale, not.
Super regionals, I believe they're called.
Super regionals.
Interesting perspectives of their own.
And so
and I've always said
I love talking to bankers,
people who understand how banking works
just like they're
I think they're usually at some of our,
our most interesting guests.
Have you looked at the, KBW Bank index,
by the way?
Not today, actually, not in a few days.
Or maybe not a few days. Yeah.
What has it been doing?
It's up quite a lot.
In fact, I think over the past 12 months
it's outperformed the S&P 500.
So that kind of tells you how people feel
about banks and bank regulation.
Absolutely. Right.
One of the things when Trump won was
the sort of like the deregulation trade.
And that was one element.
And arguably I would say in finance, by
and large, though,
10% credit card
cash does not scream deregulation.
I would say that's one of the areas
in which the expectations
of Wall Street have actually been met,
by and large, by this administration.
Anyway, I'm very excited to say
we really do have the perfect
guest
to talk about the banking world in 2026.
We're going to be speaking
with Bill Demchak, CEO of PNC financial,
which is the sixth biggest bank
in the country, I guess a super regional.
So, Bill,
thank you so much for coming on of late.
It's it's great to be here,
but I'm going to correct.
Oh, we're a national bank.
National bank. Yeah.
Why did I say super regional didn't.
Were you once that.
You know, because we have the mega
banks and people don't know
what to call somebody like us, but yeah.
I always thought super regional was
just like that category below the mega.
But I mean, a regional bank is a bank
that operates in a region.
Okay, we're.
Across the country in the largest MSAs.
We're in every state. We.
So we're just, you know, one sixth
the size of a JPMorgan.
Got it.
But we're still a national bank.
Excellent.
Well, since we're just in the center
of the correcting the record phase
of the conversation, I'm
certainly familiar with the PNC brand.
You see it on things elsewhere,
probably like a stadium somewhere or some
other stadium somewhere.
We have
PNC Park for the Pirates, PNC Park.
So there you go.
But why don't you just
give us the big overview?
Like, what is PNC financial?
We are a traditional bank.
We used to call it Main Street Bank.
Maybe that fits.
Maybe it doesn't.
But, you know, we help people save.
We lend money, we do investments,
we move money through payments.
We're a bank that aspires to be,
you know, coast to coast with,
with a retail presence,
as retail share consolidates in the US.
You know, our sweet spot is larger middle
market, smaller, large corporate.
But of course, we do commercial and
and business banking.
We're active in the capital markets across
basically every product.
But new new equity issuance.
But more of a traditional bank.
So when you talk about
you were talking about scale
and your initial thing at JP Morgan,
they've got to be in 50 countries.
You know, they're in multiple lines
of business beyond traditional banking.
We have scale and what we want to do.
So there's scale
and the things you choose to attack,
versus scale,
just measuring balance sheet size.
Got it.
You have been growing, though.
You made an acquisition recently.
First Bank is the ambition to be,
you know, as big as some of the,
the G sibs, like the nationally,
the national giants, let's say.
The ambition isn't about size.
The ambition is about being relevant.
So one of the things going on backdrop
to the US market in particular,
is there has been consolidation in retail,
share in banking, you know,
ever since they got rid of interstate
banking laws.
That continues apace with the mega banks
largely
winning,
at the expense of the very small banks.
And so at some point in the
not too distant future,
I suspect that there's going to be 5
or 6 players who control retail in the US.
The Canada model. Yeah.
And our aspiration,
and we're on pace to do it.
And we think we can do it
just to be one of those 5 or 6 banks.
What size that leads to?
I don't care, you just need to be relevant
to consumers everywhere
in the, in the country.
And you shouldn't be disadvantaged
because you don't have presence
in a particular market, would it?
How would you articulate why the really
big banks continue
to win a share of the retail market?
I could come up with some answer.
But what's the real
how would you describe it?
It's ubiquitous market presence.
You know, once you get over 7%
branch density
in a particular market,
you tend to outperform,
under the assumption you have an okay
reputation and decent products.
You know, the
you don't have to have the best,
but you have to have the menu
of all the digital applications,
digital signature
branches in the right place, you know,
electronic transfer, all the things
you come to expect from the bank.
You guys probably bank at,
you get there, and you grow.
And if you think about that definition,
there's only 3 or 4 banks today.
Actually only two that
fit that definition.
JP Morgan A.
And B of A,
the Wells, you know, has the potential,
you know, now
that they've gotten rid of the asset cap
and so forth to continue to grow.
And then you have some aspirants
who'd like to get in.
There were clearly one of those
and one of the one of the people
who's been after this game
probably longer than most.
Just so what was the metric
that you cited?
7% branch density. What is the.
Yeah.
So so,
by the way, we use 7% other banks.
We'll talk about eight,
but it's somewhere around there.
You get to a place where
if you have presence in a market,
7 or 8% of the share of just
physical presence with decent products,
you control a disproportionate
share of the actual deposits
in economics coming out of that market.
So I'm actually surprised to hear that
because the story, you know,
that's dominated
since the financial crisis
has basically been that physical branches
don't matter that much.
Yeah.
So you've seen across the U.S., you know,
net closures of branches is off the charts
relative to new builds.
But what you see behind the scenes
is somebody like PNC, where we are,
if you think about our very dense markets
where we've been for 165 years,
we're thinning those branches
because you don't need as much.
But we're building aggressively in Houston
and Dallas and Miami.
We were building in Denver
until we bought first Bank.
So going to all these growing markets
where the population's moving.
Man, it just occurred to me,
I already after we do this episode,
I want to follow up and like do
an interview with, like, whoever
your main person doing site selection
is because we've done episodes on like,
oh, we have a drive through site
selection, grocery store site selection.
We have a great team we're building.
But by the way, you know, we've announced
we're building 300 branches
in these new markets.
And as an aside, once we knock 100
off, we'll add another 100.
So it's going to keep going.
We're probably 1000 short
of where we ultimately want to be,
but we don't have to be there tomorrow.
But just building a hundred branches
a year is a mass of exercise on site
selection.
You're a construction company. Yes.
I mean exactly right.
So you need to pick the right location.
You need to choose whether you're
going to do a drive through,
or you're going to be
at the end of some shopping,
something where you're kind of an end
add on to a to a new development.
The physical,
you know, we have preset designs
so we know what we're building,
but you still need a contractor,
you need somebody running
at the physical plant
that you move into the branch.
We have pods now. New branch opens.
Truck with a pod shows up and everything
that that branch needs to run
from computers to paper to
pens is in a pod.
Just deliver it right into the branch,
which is what we're going to do.
And we do the first bank conversion.
As an aside.
That's really interesting. Yeah.
Let's talk about bank regulation
because I think this is fun.
Yeah. Very fun.
This is part of the consolidation story,
I think, is that even though
post financial crisis,
there was more focus on the significant
banks, the G sibs, at the same time,
those G sib
seem to have benefited from,
some of the regulation.
Yeah.
Is that how you would characterize it?
I don't know that they,
I don't know.
They benefited from regulation.
They had to carry extra capital.
They clearly,
you know, in times of crisis, have done
better than the broad swath of smaller
banks, as we saw with Silicon Valley
and some others.
But they were sort of walled off
from competitors.
So, you know, I've talked for years about
just the need to be able to compete.
Some of that competition comes from M&A.
Some of it just needs to, you know,
the ability to do certain activities.
In, in theory now or in an environment
where it's easier to do that.
And I think practically
that's probably true.
Although I would tell you,
I think we could have done large deals
had we chosen to back
during the Biden administration.
I, I think
people tend like one of those sound bites
that comes out of regulators is good
deals are okay, bad deals aren't.
But they won't tell you what
a bad deal is.
But a good deal is typically
when you have one bank, someone
one good bank, somebody in charge.
Yeah, you have technology
that can actually absorb the other bank.
And you can protect consumers and so on
and so forth.
Those could have gotten done
in the last administration.
That's interesting.
Well, let's talk about more
about your philosophy of M&A
because so your stock has done very well.
But it has for a while,
especially in the last year up
until recently had been underperforming.
Yeah.
Some of the other banks.
And you're like quote is like everyone
thinks we're going to do something like,
I don't know, an exact quote,
but it's like something.
Why does it for the.
Whole world's
betting I'm stupid. Yeah, right.
But so like but then how do you grow? So.
Okay, all the market
that I want to pay off the stock
because they think
that you're going to do.
This is that this isn't
this isn't complex.
We'll just start with the basics.
All right.
Last year we outperformed
I think everybody
including JP Morgan and top line revenue
growth and EPS.
People in our growth.
People, you know.
Sorry.
You think I know pre
pre-provision, net revenue.
Okay. Yeah.
Fantastic year.
We set records and new client
acquisition, revenue growth, expense
control, great new tech roll and and stuff
that we underperform.
Part of the backdrop of
that was the mega banks
outperformed as people correctly
thought regulation
was going to drop and they could return
more capital than they historically had.
So take that bucket.
They're doing great
because they have all this capital and
they're free to do whatever they want to.
Smaller banks went up in value because,
you know,
people like Bill Demchak with a big mouth
said there's going to be consolidation.
So everybody's going to buy them.
So they go up in value.
And because we are a likely acquirer,
given our historical performance
and being good at integration, we get.
Crushed.
Did you get penalized from the perception
of a more liberal M&A?
Absolutely.
But it was a part of it's my fault.
And, you know, because I talk
you know, I talk about the need for scale.
I talk about the consolidation
that's happening in retail.
I talk about why this makes sense
and people make this leap
and therefore to end the sentence
with at any cost.
And that's a terrible assumption.
Not at any cost.
We can do this organically.
It just takes longer.
And, you know, today with everything
flying in value and us underperforming,
it's extremely unlikely we find something
that makes economic sense for us.
Plus, the fact just is inside
the environment is so good right now.
Nobody none of the reasonable size
banks want to sell.
This is like,
this is like a sunny day
in in August, man.
You got you know,
rates are going the right way.
The curve is steepening.
Credit's great. Regulation is coming down.
Nobody sells their bank in that.
Do you wake up every
morning and check the PNC share price?
I always wonder about this.
CEOs of public companies, you're graded
instantaneously by the market.
Yes, but the market
at times is an unfair grader,
so I don't pay attention to it.
You know, when we
I look at metrics
all the time, are we winning clients?
Are we,
automating things
and getting more efficient?
Are we?
Is our marketing campaign reaching people?
What's our traction level and digital?
You know, all these things that ultimately
will lead to a share price performance,
but not in the day.
Well, let's talk then a little bit about
okay, so a lot of banks are doing well.
They don't
they're not they don't want to sell.
Yeah. You're not a stupid guy.
So you don't want to make
like a dumb deal.
So there's there is.
So there's not going to be
there's. Not going to be deals okay.
So you have this aspiration
to one of the really big banks.
And so okay that leaves organic growth.
What is this.
But it also yeah I mean in perspective
we're in this the
the weird window in regulatory change
isn't the Trump administration.
It was the Biden administration
any time before Biden.
And now after Biden deals get done
all the time, we're 165 years in business.
You know, the little chart
you talked about with all the banks?
Yeah, we've got to have 150 banks under us
through time, and that'll continue.
But it doesn't have to happen now, right?
The weird thing about now is just
we ended the four years of strange
period under Biden.
Got it.
Now we're just back to the old game will
go for, you know, go on and on and on.
So what is the essence
of the organic growth strategy to
if it's yeah, to grow. So,
so far I've been talking about retail.
Let me talk about the reason for retail.
So ultimate reason for retail
is retail deposits.
Retail deposits are low cost or sticky.
They allow you to support your corporate
community and consumers with loans.
We've been able to win
and what we call our Cnib business
a corporate institutional bank
business, gain share
every year for the last,
I don't know, 15 years.
And what is a very fragmented market?
You know, we talk about the mega banks
gathering retail share.
But in corporate commercial
nobody has any real share.
It's it's it's shotgun everywhere.
And we win in that space and we do it by,
you know, going to market locally.
We organize.
And this will all sound kind of silly,
but we don't have panels by product.
We have panels by client.
We go into the market.
We have a regional president,
we have product expertise,
and we choose the most important
and impressive
clients to cover in that market,
not anybody else.
We don't do business with somebody
necessarily who walks through the door,
because that's all that we'll do business
with.
We'll call on the same rate.
A client, you know, that, you know,
you want to cover if you're in Miami
or you're in Texas, we'll call on them
for ten years until they call us back.
Patience, persistence, consistency.
Good product ideas are real low bank
turning banker turnover and we win.
And you just, you know,
rinse and repeat going to new markets
add people keep your eye on.
Just on acquisitions.
I'm really curious how difficult it is
to integrate another bank
with your company because you just said
you're good at integration.
What does that actually entail?
That's a great question.
So integration
there's a mechanical component.
And then of course there's a cultural
component, mechanical component.
Should
otherwise be easy, but as proven difficult
for some people over time,
the mechanical components
to talk about first bank for us,
we simply take all of their data records.
So, you know, record field data items that
are for one of their checking accounts.
And we import that data,
but we don't import that application.
All that data comes into PNC.
And then over a weekend
we simply open up a million new accounts
on our existing products and services.
Sounds pretty simple.
If you can move the data, you can just
effectively open new accounts.
My my team will scream, it's
not that easy.
But that's basically what you do.
It looks easy to you. Yeah.
Now all of a sudden, okay, now we have
all these customers with new accounts.
How do they how do they log in?
How do they learn?
Like our online is different
than somebody else is online.
So now you're getting into training
modules, communications with clients,
training their branches
with first Bank trims and this front line
set of people incredible bank in history.
We're keeping all their client
facing employees now.
They all of a sudden
have to know the difference
between PNC products
and their old products.
So how do we do that?
That's what integration ultimately means.
There's a mechanical piece of it.
Get the systems to work.
So you turn it on, the lights go on.
There's delivering pods to the branches.
So they have all the PNC equipment
and the signage and all that other stuff.
But there's a lot of time with people.
We send in branch buddies.
So we'll take branch managers
from all around the country
and go have them spend,
you know, a couple of weeks in each,
you know, sitting with the branches
at first Bank.
That just helps your perspective. Yeah.
And the learning and it's I mean banking,
you know, in some ways is simple.
In some ways it's wildly complex.
An employee in a branch,
the problems that you might walk in.
Right.
You say, oh,
I don't really go into a branch
or I don't think about it,
but when you go into a branch,
something's really busted. Yeah.
So the employees.
So the employees. Right.
They need to know how to fix it.
And that's
when we say we're good at integrations.
It's because we focus on
making sure that our new teammates
know how to do their job
and can help their clients
because they have the same clients
they've had forever.
They don't want to look bad
in their new role.
Can you actually just talk
more about the answers, like, okay,
they need to know how to like, sell
or be familiar with the PNC product
now, like talk a little bit more about
like what that difference
is, what actually changes functionally,
why it wouldn't be what it is about either
culture or products such
that it's not just replacing the
the logo and the pens.
And the well, everything works
at the margin, slightly different.
I mean, checking accounts,
a checking account.
But imagine you're you're in a branch
or you're in the care center.
You have a problem.
You made
your car payment, you sent it through.
It was time stamped the right time,
but it went through snail mail, got lost.
You got penalized a fee,
and you go to the branch
and you say, you know,
it's really not fair.
I sent this, and I you're hitting me
with the fee and the branch person.
What do they do?
Right.
It's there's there's some answer to that.
What's our procedure?
Well, you know, now with AI,
you can just go into a
large language model that is built
off of all of our customer
service protocols and say, what do I do?
This just happened.
They'll tell you,
you know, credit the customer
the fee and send a note to the,
you know, whatever the answer is
for that particular problem.
But the
person sitting there needs to know
like which system do I query.
What's my browser,
what am I who do I talk to.
You know,
if I'm going to make an exception
do I go to the branch manager
or can we do that here.
Or do I want to call somebody
in some strange room
in a back office and Philadelphia,
all of that with us,
because we automate so much of it
is now center of query
and self-learning in the branch.
And then importantly, more and more
with our customers self caring,
you know, they get locked out.
You know, just
just be able to fix the problem yourself.
One thing I've wondered for a few years,
does local expertise matter anymore
when it comes to actual underwriting,
either in retail or commercial?
Because I think most of America
used to have this very romanticized
notion of the banks,
the sort of It's a Wonderful Life model,
where you're your branch manager, knows
you and knows
your entire life and business
and all of that.
My sense is that doesn't exist
so much anymore.
But tell me if I'm wrong.
You're wrong.
Okay.
It's harder to accomplish
when you become a larger bank.
But, you know, how is credit
evolved through time?
Consumers. Consumers.
Now, if they're an existing client of you
are scored
based on their cash flows that you see.
So not a fight go score.
You can actually see
when did somebody pay the rent
or their spending patterns predictable.
You can build models to see you know what.
This person is a really diligent
good credit
even though it might should not show up
in a like a local market business.
You're going to lend to this
small developer, you're going to lend
to this store on the corner.
Branches really matter and local bankers
matter
for small businesses
because I see where the foot traffic is.
They know the reputation of the person
who's running that business.
The people you know, are they a,
community
influencer in a good way, where they're,
you know, people want to support them.
All that stuff still matters
and all that stuff.
The more you can give somebody
voice locally in the decision,
I always kind of call it
putting a thumb on the scale
a little bit on a
yes or no that's otherwise mechanical.
The better
your credit underwriting as well.
It's just we're talking
about consumer credit.
What happens to what happens to the world,
what happens to America
or the industry
if there's a 10% cap on credit card rates?
As president Trump has proposed?
So the only thing I know for sure,
if that happens,
is that all the credit card businesses
in the country lose money,
if run exactly the way they are today.
So we have, you know,
credit card business.
I get swipe fees,
I get most of those away with rewards.
I earn credit
when somebody is revolving a balance.
I lend credit when somebody pays it
at the end of the month.
Right. I'm fronting that money for you.
If you clear your account every month.
But hopefully I'm getting some swipe fees
to make that good.
After all that, you charge interest rates,
you have losses
and you get a margin,
maybe make 4% and assume interest.
I make it up numbers here,
but assume maybe the average rate is 18%.
I make four at the bottom.
Nothing going to take my 18.
I'm going to drop it to ten.
Oh. I just made minus four.
It's all that math is going to come out.
Which is why I don't think this goes like
there's almost no way this can happen.
You'll just simply shut down
consumer credit in the US.
They can't force they can say the cap is
10% and I'll say, fine, I'm out.
I'm like, why would I do it
if I'm going to lose 4% a year on that,
something's going to change.
Fees are going to go up, lines are going
to get cut, rewards will go away.
You know, and something will emerge
out of the dust, but it's not going to
look at all like it does today.
What do you think
the genesis of the proposal
or the rationale behind it actually is?
If you know, everyone in the industry
says this basically ends credit cards.
Yeah, I think because
first of all,
the emotional appeal of it, it's I mean,
it sounds absurd that you're charging
somebody 18% for revolving credit.
I think that sounds high.
That happens to be the rate
that you need to charge to make money.
But it sounds,
which is why I never revolve a balance.
I pay it off every month.
So there's this emotion appeal.
Geez, you ought to be able to lend.
Like I'll lend money to you at 10%.
I'll lend money to you
at 10%. Thanks. Right.
But I can't necessarily figure out
who you are in a sea of people, right?
There's a bunch of people.
I'll lend money at 4%
because I'll never to pull it. You know,
that's the issue.
And you try to get to the broader
population and extend credit
to the consumer. That drives our economy.
Science isn't so exact to say
you get nine and you're 22.
I don't know about you.
Well, actually,
I want to push because intuitively,
I would think you'd be able to do that.
You just mentioned the fact
that you have granular access
to propensity to pay back,
that it's not even captured by.
Yes, you have incredible amounts of data
and predictive capacity.
And the difference between whether mere
trace you're going to revolve.
So when someone says 18% seems high, yeah.
Are we supposed to just like, believe?
Oh, just trust me, it's high.
This is what I need to charge
in order to make money in this business.
I mean, I could trust you, but I'm like,
how would you?
But the math is the math. Okay,
the end result. Right?
You say when you run your models
and you look at,
you know, propensity to pay you back,
you basically,
you know, whether you're looking at Flaco
or anything,
a Fico is only as good as whether
that person has a job next week.
Right.
They, they you know
you can look at predictability
and yes this person
has been paying their rent.
They have a steady expenditure thing
on food and on gas and on entertainment.
And their savings account balances
always stay pretty steady.
That ought to be a good credit.
Well it isn't a good credit.
If they get fired or lose their job
because the economy's in a downturn.
And all of a sudden, well,
I thought that was a really good credit.
I should charge 5%.
Turns out I just wrote the whole thing off
because there's no recovery value
in that credit.
That's that's where the science fails.
There's there's exogenous variables
you can't model
in the wider you cast the net, right.
The bigger the dispersion on outcomes.
However, if
we've settled there, that interest rate
kind of sets a reasonable profit margin.
The largest card issuer in the country,
you could figure out who this is, right?
Best at best computer models,
best funding credit, best expand.
You know, extending credit to
to to non-prime borrowers.
They trade at one times book value.
That this was a genius business like this
way too much.
I'd drop the rate by 1%
you know and gross share.
The problem
is, it's not so great, actually.
I want to talk about private credit
a little bit.
Because obviously this is an area
where we always hear about banks face
new competition from middle market lenders
and all of that.
But at the same time, we also see banks
teaming up with private credit now.
And it seems to me also. Yeah.
Okay. Talk us through that relationship.
Yeah. So traditionally,
standalone high yield credit,
if all you did was walk around
and just lend money,
with no particular expertise
but across, you know,
leveraged clients at a single big credit.
That's a really lousy return on capital,
right?
The, you know, all the science
going back to and Moody's started
tracking this stuff in the 80s.
You get kind of a 35% recovery.
You have a 10% default rate.
You go through cycles sometimes
a lot worse, sometimes a lot better.
It's not a particularly good business.
Becomes a a better business
and sometimes a fantastic business.
If you couple that with the wallet
that goes with that company beyond
just the credit.
So IPOs, M&A fees bond feel,
you know, whatever the stuff is
that goes along with all of a sudden
it becomes a pretty good business
what's happened in the
last couple of years
we've seen this drift into
more and more credit,
leaving banks going into private equity
and other alternative forms
that PNC, it manifested itself
where we'd have a client
that we might have banked
for a hundred years
on by third generation family
that just got sold to private equity,
and our client's gone,
because I don't want to make that loan
at that leverage ratio.
And whoever does make the loan
is going to demand the Treasury management
relationship and all the other stuff
that goes with that client.
So are we come out at it
is I don't know that I necessarily
want to make the loan.
I will sometimes,
but I want to keep the relationship.
So our partnership with TCW is an
example is when that happens.
Now we, you know,
we put capital in the TCW fund,
as did a bunch of other people,
but happens now.
We'll keep the client,
you know, we'll diversify the credit risk
but keep the fees.
So the return on equity on that
thing, you know, goes way up
the whole notion, remember, like
private credit in the last three years.
Oh my God.
So new thing.
We're great at it.
We're going to make you a fortune.
Why is it private equity
kind of hit the skids.
Nothing was getting sold.
They need to raise new money.
We haven't had defaults in ten years.
So a manager shows up and says,
look at my track record.
I can earn, you know, with two times
leverage, I'll give you 10%
return after fees. This is fantastic.
Private equity sucks. Come with me.
Of course, we haven't
had a credit cycle in ten years,
so those stats are all garbage.
Yeah.
You know,
I actually go through a credit cycle
and you have two times
leverage on that thing,
and you start having defaults,
which we've had a few of us on.
It's not really exciting.
Can I ask one macro question
in this conversation, which is where
where do you think we are
in the credit cycle at the moment?
I've given up trying to predict
that credit today is pretty good.
Better than pretty good.
A lot of the leverage that's
in this system that everybody complains
about are actually with things
that are very good enterprise value.
So I don't worry so much about
the disappearance of a company.
I think about it in terms of reallocation
of the ownership structure
right over there, over leveraged.
They go down either
private equity firm bails them out
or they say, no, here are the keys.
And now the debt holder owns
and then the debt holder restructures
the debt and sells them again.
Somebody lost money.
But companies still a good company
was just over levered to to go.
But most of the noise you're hearing
right now on credit beyond the fraud,
you know the cockroaches that Jamie said
come up when things get stretched.
Most of it are
decent enterprises just over levered.
And then of course, you have the fraud.
You haven't had anything that's really
going down today because the economy
just crashed on the spot.
Other than some isolated issues
with tariffs.
There is a cyclical element
to fraud, right.
Because in good times
people look the other way.
And I don't I don't think it's cyclical.
I think it's always there.
I just think you know the who's a said,
you know when the water goes out
you can figure out who's swimming nude.
I think it was buffet. Buffet. Yeah. Yeah.
Well Galbraith
however, talked about the bezzle.
Right.
The, the the propensity of flimflam
and scams to exist during the good times
and people just like,
and that accumulates and accumulates and.
That could be.
We've had like 20 years,
as you said, like we were the credits.
I mean, we're it's almost 20 years
since the financial crisis now.
Yeah.
The finance always finds its way,
finds a way to blow itself up.
I mean, it's it's yeah.
I mean, it's,
you know, it's not an opinion.
And just look at history.
I think what happens is you get you get,
you know, we find good things
and then you write them and you. Yeah.
In every instance
where something's gone wrong,
you just keep pushing on something
till you take it over the edge.
Right.
Finance is an industry where historically
you can make a lot of money at it, right?
You're playing with other people's money,
you know,
pennies and nickels
coming off of other people's money.
I'm just going to keep pushing. I'm
going to keep pushing and keep pushing.
When it finally falls, it falls hard.
We haven't had that,
you know, what's the new, new thing now?
It's fintech and it's crypto and it's,
you know, banking
has been kind of throttled
by regulation for ten years.
Well, speaking of finance,
always finding a way to blow itself up.
Can we talk about, Silicon Valley
Bank and 2023 because, you know,
they managed to blow themselves
up, for a variety of reasons.
But one of them was
they just had too many bonds,
which is kind of,
you know, an unusual one.
What was that experience like for you?
First of all,
Let's
well, let's go back to Silicon Valley.
I actually think
they had a great institution.
They had.
Been saying that.
Who's been saying that they need
terms of this plug
on the silicon Valley bank or prospectors.
Okay. Keep going.
No, it's just it it's
it was a unique business model
with a very loyal client base that they.
Not that loyal in.
The, I mean, look at, you know, if you're
Diane, loyalty goes out the window. But,
they blew themselves up
in something that was not at all
of their basic business.
Right? Interest rates are super low.
They got as long by some calculations
as, like, long term
capital was back in the night.
I mean, they were really, really levered
and underestimated the negative convexity
deposits.
Right.
You think you know on average
through the cycle
they're going to be there seven years ups.
They're gone tomorrow.
And so they just
they blew themselves up on rates that had
nothing to do with their core competence
or what they were as a franchise.
And it's unfortunate, but I mean,
it was just it was rookie mistake.
There was nothing.
There's just a crazy position to be in.
How like how scary, you know,
those those days afterwards.
And then people started hunting
for like any, any bank that had the word
California in the name, like people
were shorting it or people were they.
Or, you know, you had headlines
where, you know, the regional bank
index, the regional bank.
And it's why I'm a national bank.
We are not a regional bank,
because the next time
they put regional bank headlines in there,
I don't want to be associated together.
Now, we actually benefited during that.
You know, we're we're a safe haven.
And we actually gathered deposits
and opened thousands of new accounts
during that period of time.
And then every day
somebody would flash the regional bank
index and we'd get blasted
on our valuation, which is fine.
It always yeah.
You know, valuations are short term.
It all came ripping back after that.
So one of the issues
that came up during the 2023
banking drama,
I guess, is the discount window
and the banks reluctance
collectively to use it.
And this is something that the fed
has been trying to change.
Right.
And actually, do you remember in late
2022, there was a big spike in, tapping?
Yeah.
Usage of the discount window.
And it turned out
that wasn't any of the banks
that, like, ended up getting into trouble.
It was Bill Bank down in Texas.
It's a weird bank.
Yeah, it's a very weird bank.
But anyway, regulators trying to get banks
to use the discount window more,
feel more comfortable with it.
How do you feel about it?
But that's a great question.
So before the financial crisis
and before
regulation, and LCR and long term
debt proposals and all that other stuff,
there was a very active fed funds market.
So in a given day, the excess reserve
a bank would hold deposited in its fed
account was tiny, and we would trade
fed funds around with each other.
If I needed 2 billion,
you'd give me 2 billion.
Next day I might give you 2 billion,
like big size fed fund positions.
And that's how you balance your books
at the end of every night.
And then they come out and they say, hang
on, we don't want you doing that anymore.
There's an LCR.
You have to have this much liquidity
stuck aside.
Instead of going into the fed funds market
that gave rise to all these excess
reserves, fed fund markets,
basically the fed sets that rate,
nobody trades on that rate.
It's as dead as LIBOR.
It's gone.
I don't even know why
they talk about it anymore.
Now you have they basically said to
you, don't use the discount window
and hold all this cash.
You just froze the economy
because you stopped the circulation
and of, of of capital transformation.
Home loan banks step in
because I have to hold all of these
treasuries and mortgage securities.
I can pledge them the home loan
and they'll lend me money
at a pretty good rate.
So that's going to be my outlet.
I'm going to go to a home loan
and I'm just going to borrow.
They're at a pretty good rate or I'm going
to repo my treasuries that I hold.
Silicon Valley happens.
And they had home loan loans.
They didn't have any discount
window lines.
Now the discount window
will lend against treasuries
and agencies
pretty simply because it's basically
settled electronically
through effectively the fed wire system.
If you're pledging loans,
it's really hard to pledge.
So if all I have is securities to pledge,
I should just repo them
or I'll give them to the home loan bank
discount window will do more than that.
But if I want to draw against my loan
balance, I need to give them
physical wet signature
loan docs in a vault guarded,
audited 24 hours a day
like there's going to be a garden.
I wet signatures stacked up
so they know that when I draw against that
loan, I actually have that loan
because it doesn't settle fed wire
like a bond does.
This is a loan, right?
I lend you money, you sign
the thing, I put it in the door somewhere.
Then you
say, all right, let's pre-position
these loans we spent PNC spent millions
and millions and millions of dollars.
So the vast majority of our CNI loans
are now at the discount window,
We don't borrow on them,
but they're there.
If we wanted to borrow under them.
I got a call.
It's gotten a little better,
but you can't finish it.
That I got to finish it,
so it's gone a little better.
But basically, like during Covid,
you know, or post Covid,
when nobody is coming in the office,
you'd call, like the way you borrow
from these companies,
you call it Cleveland.
There are there are fed to all this.
And then they say, okay,
you're in good shape,
will allow Washington
to allow you to use the discount window.
And then they'll call Washington
and then maybe like a day or so
later, you can have money
when nobody is coming in the office,
nobody would answer the phone.
I got to draw in the discount window.
It just rings. Nobody's there.
There's no system.
It's not like I can type in and draw.
It's not like I can do a fed funds
trade through a broker and draw the money.
It's it's unusable.
But now you're pre-positioned.
Yeah. To borrow against loans.
If you need to. Yeah.
We have enough liquidity on hand
basically to cover anything
that can happen because we positioned all
of our collateral and the optimal spots.
Plus we just got
you talk about physical spot
when you say you because you're talking
about like wet signature documents.
Yeah.
So the only place you can borrow against
CNI loans in effect
is the discount window.
So okay. So okay.
So they're going to go over there.
That's what signature
I can borrow against securities
in the repo market
at the home loan or the fed.
So this is
kind of the confusion that happened with
where was stuff
pledged with Silicon Valley.
I have, you know, 50 billion of cash
sitting on the Fed's excess reserve book.
So that's instant liquidity.
And I own a whole bunch of treasuries
that I can sell if I had to.
So you just you figure out
how do I optimally earn whatever I can
on these assets?
I'm pre-positioning,
but get them in the right place.
So if I need liquidity in an emergency,
I can get it.
Silicon Valley did not do that,
and the fed did not make it easy
for them to do that.
And I'm just going to be clear
when you say
get them in the right place,
you mean like a physical place?
Some of it's physical, like the loans,
the wet signature ones.
I literally think we take them down
to, like, a vault and spin a dial,
you know, with the big, the big crank,
and they get locked in there.
But, no securities by Cusip,
you would say.
Like this, Birch
accepts, is pre-positioned with the fed.
So I just know where they are.
I know the balances.
I know I can send them
right over fed wire and draw on that.
So it's it's it's that thing. Yeah.
One thing I always wondered
with the discount window.
So part of the reluctance historically
to tap it on the part of banks has been
they're worried
it'll get out into the market.
Right.
And there'll be rumors
that they're tapping the market.
How does that actually happen?
I don't understand the leaks.
So in theory, because let's imagine
somebody drew on the fed.
So the discount window is regional fed.
Let's assume somebody took down
100 billion from the or even 20 billion
from the discount window
through the Cleveland
Fed kind of levy PNC.
So the people can figure out who it is.
So why are you doing that?
And then I got a story and I got to
explain it where I think this should go.
So go back to the original
where I said fed funds is dead.
Nobody trades it.
We ought to just trade the discount
window.
Right. The discount rate ought to be.
I'm just lending
and borrowing all day long.
I can leave money excess reserves.
Right.
If I have money to give and I can borrow
money discount window when I need money.
And there ought to be like a five basis
point.
Better offer on that.
You'd put more liquidity into the system
here to grow the economy if you did that.
You know, in a great way.
But it's like they wiped out LIBOR.
They wiped out fed funds
through all their LCR from the,
you know, the idea of the discount rate,
just bet offer on the discount rate
and then all of a sudden discount
window becomes right way
transaction. It's happening.
Yeah. The stigma goes away.
Yeah.
So you have to forgive me because there's
a lot going on in the world today.
So I can't pay attention to everything.
I have no idea where you stand
on a yield bearing stablecoins,
which I understand
to be a big thing, debate in the sector.
And I'm again,
I have I've been paying attention to
other things,
but I see headlines about this pop up.
Yeah. So,
stablecoin legislation, genius
that comes out.
They left a little loophole in there.
They said no interest, but it kind of
got run around by offering rewards,
promos, same thing.
Clarity act
is what's being debated right now.
They're trying to close that loophole.
They being kind of banks
and people around banks.
Keeping the loophole open as crypto.
You know, why not. If you can pay interest
it's going to drive volume.
I want to pay interest banks.
I don't want you to pay interest
because you're going
to potentially suck deposits
out of this system, and you're
messing around with the capital system
that's worked for 250 years.
You sure you want to mess with it?
You know,
at the end of the day, I think of
I think the following stablecoin
has been built,
launched, marketed as a payment mechanism.
It's somehow.
And by the way, I'm not sure it will, but,
you know, it's going to make payments
easier, faster, cheaper, whatever.
Not as an investment vehicle.
Right?
An investment vehicle is a different
animal and needs different regulation.
So all a sudden like a stablecoin
this by T-bills that pays you interest.
That looks an awful
lot like a money fund to me.
That's fine.
If it's a money fund,
then regulate it like a money fund.
Can't break the bank.
You got to have this much liquidity
on hand.
You know, all the disclosure rules
that go around with it.
Then do what you want with it.
You know,
go ahead and pay people and money funds.
I just think they're mixing things.
And I think, you know, my,
my uninformed worry
is we're not done
blowing up in crypto yet.
Right.
It's in fits
and starts as you learn these things.
Why do
we need to start everything at once.
Let's figure some stuff out.
If it works and there's a logic
to doing it then go ahead and do it later.
I just I don't know that you need to do it
all at once.
What's the rush? Yeah.
You know,
we are coming up to, the Super Bowl.
And when I think of Super Bowl,
I always think of,
the basil and game proposals
and that ad that they ran in 2024.
It, it was a real, wasn't it?
It was a very effective marketing tool,
at least for me.
And we are expecting
a proposal, of the end game.
What's your sense
of what might change between, you know,
the original document
or suggestions versus now?
I have no insight
information on that. But,
the original proposal that
was written was in contempt of math.
They basically
they had a goal of raising capital,
and then they used bad math
to cause that outcome,
which was a lot of
what the outrage was over because
if you start making up rules
and capital allocation,
you inadvertently cause risk
to emerge in places that shouldn't.
So I think the math is fixed.
You know, the lawsuit on the stress test
and the in the fact
the models need to be public.
So the math is going to be a lot better
on what they measure.
You've heard about indexing some scores
to inflation and some of the boundaries.
I don't know what they're going to do
on operated risk capital.
That's been a fight.
I think they're going to give some credit
on credit risk ratings
that Europe gives that we don't.
And my guess is there'll be
something in there for everybody,
and then everybody will collectively
be disappointed about something.
They're not going to give away the shot,
but they're going to try to make it
directionally correct
and based on real math,
instead of made up stuff.
I want to go back to something
you said about the bank integration,
and you actually gave a very rare,
I would say,
actual 2026 application
of, generative
AI implementation, where you mentioned
that the person at the local bank
branch can actually, like ask a question
about the policies and learn
so that that wasn't just a hypothetical.
That's a real thing that's happening right
now. Yeah. That's real. Can you talk?
This is a theme that's been
we've been talking about on the,
podcast lately, which is,
you know,
not just AI per se or implementing AI.
We're going to like implement AI, but
like, you know, the changing relationship
between a company
and their software vendors and,
you know, does
AI change some of these relationships?
Do you have leverage
because there are certain,
like niche functions that you could, like,
build yourself?
Can you talk a little bit
about how you're seeing
some of these things
play out within your firm?
Yeah, this is fun because there's
so much better information.
Great about that. So
start with the basics.
In order to utilize
a, you need clean data.
Define data with a single source of truth.
We've spent ten years
doing that in a fortune.
So, you know, as silly as that sounds,
I think how many different places
inside of a company you might have,
you know, a checking account balance
that's in morphed into the average
checking account balance over seven days,
or the median or the this or the that.
And so when someone's trying to pull data
to run a report or build a model,
they don't even know what the real,
they don't even know what they're pulling.
So you got to get it
clean at the base source and an index.
Then you're going to know
you have the capacity to build a model,
whether it's large language or analytical,
like large language models.
There's open models out there
you can just use,
which is what we tend to do
to build our document sorting.
We're using it on our own data,
our own documents.
I don't need their data.
And I
don't need to retrain their model per se,
other than running it on my own data,
which is a much smaller compute factory,
right?
I don't have the whole internet
down there and downloaded.
I just got this thing right.
And then once we train
the model, running the model
doesn't take a lot of compute training.
The model takes a lot of compute.
When we implement
talk about AI,
some of it's the the fancy object thing.
I'm going to implement Copilot.
And now people can write emails for me.
Everybody knows
when copilot wrote my email
because it's way too polite
and the punctuation is correct.
Does that make us any money?
Probably not, you know, but it's cool.
And yeah, that's so when you hear most
people say no reason, I they just plugged
in copilot and paid somebody
20 million bucks a year for licenses
where it starts to make a difference
is when it can answer questions in a hurry
for our employees or our clients,
and where it can automate process
the same way.
We've been on this automation journey
for 20 years now, right?
Starting with internet and then kind of
microservices and applications.
AI is just the next stage of that.
You know, we've got we over the last
ten years probably get 30 points
of productivity efficiency
in our operating environments,
really last seven years, actually,
AI is going to give us another 30
and it's going to come through time.
But it's think of it as a automation.
All it is is
even when people talk about AI,
they'll say, oh, you know, send an email.
It's not an AI model, it's
just a decision tree.
You know, it's automating a script
in an answer, moving data in a way
where somebody doesn't have to swivel,
you know, pretty basic stuff.
What about on underwriting?
Would you use AI to automate
that particular process?
It's actually not legally allowed today.
So the there's.
I mean, it's truth
in lending or something,
you know, 1 or 1 of these laws
where if I tell you,
you know, you applied for your credit
card, they just kept my rates at 10%.
So I said, no, I've got to give you the
three reasons you know, of why I said no.
With an AI model,
we look at a thousand variables,
and the weight of each of those variables
is dependent upon their interaction
and your particular profile.
So the weight of rent might be very heavy
for one person and not for another.
Based on the profile,
I can't give you three reasons.
The model told me no.
Yeah, the model told me yes.
So what ends up happening
today in credit decisions?
This is crazy.
But it works is we'll set
with our normal criteria this like this
debt to income, you know, whatever else
you look at, we'll say yes or no.
And then if we tell, you know, we use
AI to try to tell you. Yes.
Because I can still use
my original excuses.
No, but if I turn, you say yes
after the fact.
You're not mad at me.
So it's.
It's crazy.
But the point is that, legally speaking,
if you say no, you have to be able
to articulate a reason.
Yeah.
So what ends up happening
is everybody sets this bar way too high.
This is the one of these silly rules
that needs to be,
looked at. I mean, we we do use.
It's not so much AI.
There's a lot of decision tree
models on automation that help
with underwriting.
But it's not necessarily
a machine learning application.
Tracing.
I mean, I find I get this idea of, like,
AI as another form of workflow automation.
Very intuitive. Yes.
Tracy and I used to, publish transcripts
of the podcast,
but it was a very labor intensive,
labor intensive process
to, like, clean it up, etc..
And so I thought,
like I was going to be the panacea.
It's like clean this text.
It just when we were doing it,
it wasn't there yet.
It was like creating fake.
It was creating sentences
that weren't there.
But I understand this intuition that I can
then be like
trained on a repeatable process right now.
And again, the things that we call
I would do days, large language models,
those workflow automations like are they
are there certain workflow automations
that today
workflow processes that you could say
we've been able to automate them in a way
we couldn't have five years ago?
Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.
But let me let me just give you
kind of some scope and some numbers
and what's actually happening.
And I we have a pretty clean tech stack.
So maybe we're a little further ahead
at this than, than some.
But we have
we focused on a billion,
four of addressable
spend inside of our care centers,
in our operating environments.
This is just solving problems
for customers, moving all that stuff.
A billion for we spend
we've come up with a 171
different ways to use AI
in reducing that spend and the addressable
piece of the billion for,
we think probably 40% of it.
Of the 171 use cases,
we prioritize, five that are live.
And so what is you know, what is one of
those look like, for example?
So imagine,
inside of our
wealth business,
you know, we got a bunch of trust lawyers.
So my grandfather, it's actually with PNC.
My grandfather created this
small little trust skip generations
and it's written it's beautiful.
It's for handwritten on, like three pages.
Maybe it was my great grandfather.
Some lawyer every month has to look
at that thing and say,
you know, this qualifies or doesn't
or we're going to do this distribution.
All of those things are manual.
Now just read them into the document
writer and all of the things that are
mechanical outcomes from those millions
of pages of trust documents
are right in front of you.
Right. Payment on this date here.
The beneficiaries, it just
it makes it real simple.
So document reading expression of what's
in documents and the basic stuff.
You know no I don't have to just go
and search and find and human error.
That that stuff will make a difference.
I worry
with too much focus on the cool, fun toy.
ChatGPT.
I mean, this is, you know,
it's a new Google search. It's called.
Give me the answer that
that isn't going to make the world better
if that's all it's used for.
How did you get a clean tech stack?
Because this is something that also goes
hand in hand with bank consolidation.
You always hear that,
you know, banks end up with this
tangled mess of technological systems,
maybe some that include, cobble or
like old languages and things like that.
COBOL, I can never.
Remember can't even. Yeah.
You weren't even born yet
when we were programing and COBOL.
So how do you so how do.
You manage so.
Honest answer right in the middle
of the financial crisis.
Right.
We merged with National City
under duress from both firms.
Kind of a regulatory wedding.
Neither of us had
the capacity to run a larger firm.
I mean, I distinctly remember,
you know, talking to the combined
organization, we have to rethink
how we run something you can't manage
by walking around anymore.
And neither tech stack
could survive on its own.
And so we saved less money than we said
we would in the announcement.
Or actually,
we saved what we said we would save.
But quietly, we reinvested 2
billion bucks a year for ten years.
Wow. Yeah.
So literally all new.
We went from single server stack Apple,
you know, so this computer runs
that application and each
computer is different because whoever
the application owner was went to dinner
with Dell that day or HP the next day.
Yeah, we had 11 data centers.
None of it was in a virtual environment.
So building our own,
first cloud environment and then secondly,
writing everything in cloud language
in a microservice application.
So it's cloud native.
That's forever.
But we spent a ton of dough
and just have invested,
invested, invested, and got to a place
where our tech stack is as modern
as any fintech you'll find out there.
All right, build them.
This is fun.
This is a lot of fun.
Thank you so much for taking the time.
We had a lot.
Thank you for being interested.
Yeah, that was great.
That was great. Really appreciate
you coming on. Yeah.
Good to be here.
Thank you Tracy
I really enjoyed that conversation.
There was I learned a lot about banking.
Yeah. Conversation. We had a lot in that.
But I, I just want to keep going.
There are so many interesting angles.
Bill actually answer the questions.
Which is cannot be said for every seat.
You know, I would say most of our guests
are very good at answering questions.
Not every CEO is
great at always answering questions.
But I was like, oh, I'm like learning
something with each one of these things.
Let's keep. Going.
Also, genuinely,
he seemed to have a good handle
on like the granular practical aspects.
I know running a bank.
So I was really interested to hear
how they redesigned their tech.
Yeah.
After the financial crisis, I guess
they got a head start on everyone else.
And then also the pre-positioning
of collateral at the discount window,
I knew that the fed
had been encouraging banks to do it.
I did not realize that you had to send
the actual mortgage docs.
If you borrow against those.
It is crazy how much is not just done
automatically, electronically.
Right?
And here was
I didn't ask it, but I was going to ask
does blockchain solve this question?
But the idea that like, okay,
all of these things really are
electronic ish, although there's clearly
this physical component,
but the idea that here is something
which is theoretically monetizable,
which has liquid
value is a liquid instrument.
But because of the way that the system is
structured cannot actually be liquidated
or turned into liquid assets immediately
if it had were not pre-positioned.
It's sort of a
that actually does still seem a little bit
wild to me that that is the case.
I always thought
that mortgage assignations were like
one use case for blockchain, right?
Yeah, yeah.
You could reasonably see blockchain,
you know, helping out with that
problem versus, I don't know,
tracking the origins of lettuce.
And it's like
it always seemed kind of ridiculous.
Well it seems like one of these things
which is in banking
and again is like integrated databases.
So there's like a be
a central bank database.
There will be a home
loan bank database and the regional bank
and the bank database.
Right.
And the question is like,
why can't they just all.
Talk to. Each other.
Yeah.
See the relevant parts of the database.
Right.
And I suppose that's
easier said than done.
I really like hearing him talk to you
about practical applications of AI.
Yeah.
Which again,
maybe feels a little different
than some of our conversations last year,
or it feels like now there's more
articulated examples of being,
of this
as a sort of labor saving or time
saving technology.
So that's another thing I think we have
to pay more attention to in 2026.
Okay. Shall we leave it there? Yeah, let's
leave it there.
