My number one issue is public safety.
My number two issue
is the behavioral health crisis
that we were just talking about.
And my number three issue was,
I want to tell the world and let them know
that San Francisco is open for business.
We're going to cut the red tape
so our small businesses can flourish.
And so I've been saying the same thing
for about two and a half years now
from the time I ran to right now
on this great podcast.
I'm going to say thank you. Thank you.
We need police officers walking the beat
along commercial corridors.
Art, families that are taking their kids
to public school
and using Muni, deserve a,
a muni stop
that is free of people using drugs.
It's unacceptable.
Hello, and
welcome to another episode
of the Odd Lord's Podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal and. I'm Tracy Alloway.
Tracy, we have a mayoral election
coming up here in New York City.
Very exciting.
I think when this comes out,
it'll be literally tomorrow.
We're recording this October 28th.
No one knows for sure
what's going to happen,
but I think it'll be like the day
after this episode comes out.
Absolutely.
And obviously a very heated
mayoral election. Yes.
I think, one that's kind of taking
national attention as well, which,
you know, New York is always important,
but maybe.
It's only for the media.
It's always very important to the media.
That's definitely,
that's definitely the case.
But you know what?
I think, there's obvious reasons
why there's a lot of national interest
besides the fact that as reporters,
we like to report on our hometown,
a lot of cities are dealing with the same
challenges that New York is leaving.
New York
City is a very expensive city to live in.
There are a lot of cities
that are very expensive,
particularly any city
that has some sort of economic dynamism.
Right now, new York
City has a number of quality of life
issues that frustrate voters,
whether it's, crime,
which has come down a lot, but,
you know, safety on public transportation,
homelessness, etc., public drug use,
which, in my opinion, has gotten
a lot better over the last few years,
but it was very prevalent.
I saw it a lot in the parks in 2021, 22.
These are not by no means
are these issues that are sort of New York
o dealing with the Trump administration
and, tensions there.
And these are not New York City
specific issues at all? No.
And it's funny, as we sat down
to record this particular episode,
right when we sat down, I got a, an email,
the data behind Chicago's citywide
housing shortage.
Chicago's another. One. Yeah.
And I mean, there are so many
commonalities between these cities.
It's definitely worth
comparing and contrasting.
One thing I got to ask
just for the New York election.
Yeah.
Are you still a single
issue voter on rats?
Yeah.
Well,
if I were, my candidate would no longer.
Be, I know.
Was I have to find a number two issue.
I'll do. I'll start to do some research
over the weekend.
Good idea.
Anyway, you know, obviously,
one of the cities
I've always been more
of a Southern California guy,
but I've come really come around on
San Francisco. We're there.
Last November, I had
a, I think it was last November.
We had a great time.
I loved using the Waymo's.
It's a stunning city, and it really is.
It's not just the Bay area, it's
San Francisco specific.
That is the beating heart of the
AI boom right now.
So the most in, important
industry in the world is there.
It's truly a lovely city,
however, has many of the same quality
of life and affordability questions
that we faced in an earlier maybe.
And so some would say
for at least a time, arguably worse.
Yeah.
I mean, I remember from visiting
and also has some very,
very beautiful neighborhoods
with a historic building.
Yeah, very,
very cute neighborhoods in many respects.
And so you can imagine that efforts
to boost housing
affordability immediately
run into that whole neighborhood vibe.
I, I a few years ago,
I was visiting a friend
and I said, I love this neighborhood.
I love where you live.
And here's like a yimby it's like, Joe,
you're not supposed to say
that this is the neighborhood.
He's a renter, though,
so of course he doesn't mind
if this house gets torn down
for new builds.
Anyway, we really do have
the perfect guests to talk about big city
governance, all of these things
we are going to be speaking with,
literally the perfect guest, Daniel Lurie.
He is the new mayor of San Francisco,
or he came into office earlier this year.
So he's been in, in an office,
less than a year.
So, Mayor Lurie, thank you so much for,
coming on the podcast.
Joe. Tracy, it's good to be with you.
I feel like you are selling our city
better than I could.
So you two can just keep going.
And, Joe, your love of Southern
California, we'll get you.
We'll get you going on Northern California
and San Francisco
by the end of this podcast.
Okay. Well, that's a good goal for you to
fully
flip me over to be Northern California.
No, I really I really, I did love it.
You know, there's so many different angles
that we could start with.
People have talked about the homelessness
challenge.
Let's just start there.
People have talked about
the homelessness challenge
in San Francisco for a long time.
How would you identify by setting aside,
solving it, whatever that means.
What is it about San Francisco
that, in your view, has made that?
What are the underlying conditions
that the city has faced for a long time,
such that it's been a fairly acute problem
facing the city?
How should we understand the causes of it?
Well, I think it's been going on for 3
or 4 decades now.
I think we have not built enough
housing, not only here in the city,
but across the state.
So it really is
a regional and a state issue.
I would
argue right now it's not just a
homelessness crisis.
It's a fentanyl crisis.
We have a real crisis on our streets.
I go up and talk to people that are
suffering on our streets every single day.
Most mornings
I spend 45 minutes to an hour,
talking to people, trying to get people
off the street and into shelter,
into treatment,
into the right kind of beds.
We kind of had a live
and let live attitude
for a while in this city.
And that has changed.
We have changed that attitude
over the last year.
We want to get people off the street
and into help.
But of course, it is an affordability
issue, statewide.
And we need to build
more housing statewide.
We're in the midst right now of
of getting, a family zoning plan.
New map, passed here, because the state
has, mandated that of all counties
and in San Francisco, in the state,
and San Francisco is going to do its part.
And we need more housing.
Definitely want to talk about the family
zoning project, for sure.
But just on the homeless issue,
I guess one area, of commonality
between New York and San Francisco is
you do have this debate over mental health
and, I guess, how to balance
compassionate outreach
with stricter enforcement
or stricter policing.
What are you doing on that front
when you say you need to get people
help, what's actually happening?
Yeah.
First off,
I don't believe it's compassionate
to allow someone to,
be passed out on the sidewalk.
I don't believe, we should allow people
to smoke fentanyl in our bus stops.
We have to, put an end to that.
And we have to
then get people into the right kind
of bed, the right kind of treatment.
For example, we opened up a 16 bed,
center at a place called a 22 Geary.
It is a place that we can,
someone can walk in, it is voluntary.
It's police friendly. It's fire friendly.
So they can bring somebody in.
They can stay for 24 hours.
They can get on two medication.
They can take a moment to,
relax and
and and we have staff there,
then then gets them out to the right
recovery bed, to the right treatment
bed, of which we have
stood up 400 new beds.
Just this year alone, that are, you know,
90 day, six month treatment, programs.
That's what we need to do.
What we were doing as a city before was
we were just building
lots of permanent supportive housing,
which I believe in.
But if you are struggling
with a fentanyl addiction and you are
put into housing without services,
without support, it is not a good fit.
And we have really come, to understand
that,
really in a really important
way this year.
And so we are doing a much better job
of getting people off the street
into a short term care
and then into long term care.
But we have a long way to go.
But that.
822 Gary, 24
hours, is an example of a new approach.
One other thing that we've
done is since I came into office
in the first month,
we readjusted how we do neighborhood
outreach or street outreach.
We had seven different departments
prior to us, me coming into office.
Now, those seven
different departments are,
put together
in what we call a team of teams.
They meet each morning,
as though seven departments
in one mission outreach team,
one tenderloin outreach team.
They go out together, they know who their,
target population is.
They know the names of the people,
and they try to get them off the street
and into those right kind of bets.
You know, there was an incident
in New York City recently.
I probably should have looked up
the details a little bit more,
but I think there was, some
an influencer took some photos of people
selling knockoff bags on Canal Street.
Which they've been doing, which they've.
Been doing,
which they've been doing for decades.
And then I think, I came in
and I was actually on Canal Street
two nights ago, they're back, etc..
So whatever they supposedly solved from
looks like it was just
for the cameras for one day.
But there is this argument that I've heard
which is like,
you know what, if you don't want ice
to come in and clean up your streets,
you should have done it yourself.
And I don't really have a strong opinion
on like the optimal level of enforcement
or the optimal level of like how extreme
you want to get to enforce
certain quality of life things.
But I have some sympathy for this view
that like,
well, you know, there's all this sort
of public disorder, etc..
And where were the, politicians prior to,
the Trump administration
taking some of these things seriously?
Do you think it's fair to say that
the Democratic Party,
in a number of big cities have not taken
what people call quality of life
seriously enough in the past?
I'm not going to speak
for the Democratic Party.
I'm, I was never in politics.
I ran because of the disorder
on the streets of San Francisco.
I ran, my number
one issue is public safety.
My number two issue
was the behavioral health crisis
that we were just talking about.
And my number three issue was,
I want to tell the world and let them know
that San Francisco is open for business.
We're going to cut the red tape
so our small businesses can flourish.
And so I've been saying the same thing
for about two and a half years now.
From the time I ran to right now
on this great podcast,
I'm going to say thank you.
Thank you.
We need police officers walking the beat
along commercial corridors.
Our, families that are taking their kids,
to public school
and using Muni, deserve a,
a muni stop
that is free of people, using drugs.
It's unacceptable.
And it was, two and a half years ago
for me.
It's, acceptable to me.
So local law enforcement can do the job.
We are short a number of officers.
We have the first net increase in police
and sheriff's deputies in ten years.
A net increase
for the first time in ten years.
And so we need to get back
to full staffing, and we can handle it.
We can handle it.
So just real quick
follow up like I, I agree,
I mean, and I agree
I would like to have public transportation
stops everywhere where there is not public
drug use, public, drugs for sale, etc..
Where do you encounter
the opposition to that?
Like what have you discovered about
where are the roadblocks are.
Because again, seems really sensible that
you shouldn't be, using drugs in public.
Oh, I had a wiretap position.
Oh. Well, I you know, it's funny, I, I
there are people, and,
I talk to them every day.
I drop my kid off,
my son off in the mission.
And I
walk the streets from the mission
to Hayes Valley most mornings,
and there's a bike route,
and, there was four people,
four of whom were either in the midst
of using drugs or had used drugs,
and I was telling them
they needed to move, and they we would
we would give them help.
We would give them offer of support.
And someone came by, but literally
in the bike lane and someone, stopped
and said, what are you doing?
They live here.
And I said, this is a bike lane,
that parents are taking their kids
to school on the back of their bikes.
They're walking their kids to school.
So there is opposition and,
and but I would also tell you
that the vast
majority of San Franciscans,
wants, public safety.
They want clean streets,
they want safe, sidewalks.
And, we are delivering on that.
Crime is down 30% in our city.
Crime in Union Square,
our financial district, because of,
the the staffing increase
that we put together through something
we call the hospitality zone
task force for Union Square.
Mosconi. Yerba Bueno,
which is our downtown hub.
Crime is down 40%.
Violent crime in our city.
We haven't seen these type of rates
since the 1950s.
So what we are doing is working and,
we are going and the vast
majority of people are very excited.
This is the first time in a very long time
that San Franciscans,
the majority of them, feel like our city
is heading in the right direction.
And we are a city on the rise,
and it's a great time to be here.
Well, tell us more about what exactly
you're doing.
And one thing I'm very curious about is,
I guess, the division of labor or division
of responsibility
between the mayor's office
or the district attorney
or the police force and things like that.
Well, I think, the police
officers have, a responsibility,
obviously, to keep safety.
And and our district attorney, has done
a great job.
Prosecutor.
And really going after these,
fentanyl dealers.
So, you know, I've, I mean,
I think your audience, you all told me
before coming on is,
this the smartest audience there is?
That's right.
So, listeners,
we always say you're the smartest
out there.
But, you know,
listen, our Sfpd,
they're they're incredible.
They are driving crime down.
We have a great partnership
with our DEA,
with our city attorney, with our sheriffs,
our our our park rangers are doing
a great job in our parks as well.
We, it's a team effort, and we are united,
in making sure that everyone here in San
Francisco knows every visitor to San
Francisco knows every convention goer
knows that public safety is our number
one priority.
We we pulled off the NBA All-Star game.
We had the, Chinese New Year
parade on the same weekend.
It went off without a hitch.
We just had a conference with 50,000
people last week in San Francisco.
We had a demonstration, on a Saturday
with 50,000 people marching, zero arrests.
We know how, to keep people safe,
and we're proving it.
You mentioned that, you know, you want
to be a dynamic place for business.
We're also talking about, homelessness
should a San Francisco keep prop seized.
So I understand that on big companies
with over revenue of over $50 million,
that there's this tiny gross revenue tax,
some speculate, though it's not confirmed.
I don't know if they've said it,
but that is one reason
that stripe does not have its headquarters
in San Francisco.
Should that be revisited
so as to bring more,
corporate activity into the city itself?
What I've always said is that we need
to be competitive on the tax front.
We're out of whack with San Jose
and and Santa Clara County.
So, you know, actually, every candidate
for mayor last year, supported,
what was called prop m, which kind of,
realigned our tax structure.
Got it. Got it more competitive.
That was an important step for our city.
I think it signaled to,
everybody that we were serious about,
being in the ballpark.
I think we probably
still have more work to do, but the
the thing that I think
companies really look at,
is the quality of life and,
they look at their street conditions,
they look at public safety.
I think that is without question
the most important thing.
And we are
they are seeing that they have a mayor
that is delivering on that front,
that I am focused
on creating the conditions
so that they can succeed.
And it's what we that's our mantra.
We want to create the conditions
so that small businesses can succeed.
And that big business is is welcome back
here.
Well, I always say though, you too is
I want these companies to be part
of the community though, like I want them
investing in our public transit.
I want them investing
in our public schools.
I want them investing in our arts
and cultural institutions.
I would say, you know, for a long time,
and I ran
Tipping Point Community, which is similar
to Robin Hood in New York City.
You know,
the tipping point was always focused on
bringing individuals and companies,
to help, support
those that were living in poverty,
those, around job training and housing.
But we need to see more,
we need to see more of our business
community, work
and do our part, at the administration
to create the conditions
for their success.
But I need them to help us,
make sure that San Francisco regains its
status as the greatest city in the world.
We're not far off.
We're closer than most people think.
We are the most beautiful city
in the world right now,
and we are soon going to be
the greatest city in the world again.
I was going to say
New York might take issue
with the greatest City in the world label.
Who I'm talking to.
Okay, since we are
talking about companies,
one of the reasons
we wanted to talk to you is,
as Joe mentioned in the intro, San
Francisco, obviously a massive tech hub.
And what we're seeing at the moment
in markets and the economy, it's
kind of weird because, you know, AI
related stocks keep going up.
Everyone's very excited.
But on the other hand, you have a lot of
layoffs happening in the tech industry.
So I think more than 100,000 job cuts
at places like Microsoft and Meta.
When you look at San Francisco's
labor market
right now or overall economy,
what are you seeing?
Is there a net benefit from AI
or are you seeing increased unemployment?
No, I mean, right now
we're seeing absolutely.
We're seeing, people from, Texas
and New York and other parts of the globe
buying buildings in San Francisco,
betting on, real estate,
understanding that,
that it's not just about AI, though.
It's really about the ecosystem
that is is growing up around,
a company like
OpenAI or Anthropic or Databricks.
These are enabling companies
and startups and entrepreneurs
and the health care space, and,
and others like it is
booming in that respect.
But I also want to create the conditions
so that we have a durable,
trajectory.
Not one that is just reliant on, on just,
you know,
on, on tech or on AI.
But because, you know, we
we did that in the 20 tens,
we were so solely focused just on tech.
And I think what you're seeing here
is that we are seeing
a broad based recovery, arts and culture.
We're seeing new restaurants, we're
seeing healthcare really take off also.
And so, we want it to be durable.
We want it to be broad.
But there's no question
that AI is driving,
and is a major force, and it's a force of
in terms of for good, in terms of,
jobs.
What should
the next mayor of New York City,
whoever you know, you
you deal with all these CEOs of startups
and they go on Twitter and they yap
and they threaten to move to Austin,
or they threaten to move to Miami, etc..
I think a bunch of them move back.
But they said
they're saying the same thing here.
Some of them were like, oh, I'm going to,
you know, move to Nashville or whatever.
So and so gets elected.
What should the next
mayor of New York City know about having
a productive relationship with,
a significant part of the tech space?
Well, I would I say to any
and next mayor of any city,
don't listen to me.
Don't listen to me.
I I'm ten months in,
and I'm solely focused on San Francisco.
I get asked,
but you. Must have learned something good.
So I'm saying I'm asking.
You're asking him to advise
his competitors.
There's you. You've stuff. Right?
In the ten months or whatever,
nine months since you've been on the job,
what have you learned about,
Yeah.
Interacting with, these very,
very powerful, wealthy interests.
Well, listen, I think what I've learned
throughout my career
is that you have to have an open door.
You have to have conversations
with people.
Most importantly,
you have to listen to people.
Whether, you know,
you're trying to get, family zoning,
our housing plan passed,
and I'm in neighborhoods that you all were
describing before who are like,
you know, I'm worried and I'm scared, and
and there are a lot of people fearful
about new housing.
And you have to go listen, and you have to
work with them, and you have to invest.
And I think the same goes with our,
immigrant community, goes with our arts
and culture communities.
It goes with our restaurant tours,
who I sit down
and meet with and listen to the struggles
that they have with their power bills
going up 30, 40% over the last two years.
I do,
I pride myself on listening to people,
working with people,
and then getting to the right solution
that's going to benefit
as many San Franciscans as possible.
So on zoning, since it keeps coming up,
one thing you hear a lot,
especially in the case of San Francisco,
is that the housing shortage is mostly
about restrictive zoning and regulation
and things like that.
Is is that it?
How how restrictive is the regulation?
And it are there other factors,
I suppose, that are playing into this.
Absolutely.
I mean, listen, we we
it it's been restrictive, but
the state has, loosened
those restrictions quite a bit.
We are doing everything we can to make it
easier, to build more affordable housing.
I went to three ribbon cuttings last week.
Three different sites for 100% affordable,
in different parts of the city.
The cost of labor is really high.
The cost of of of goods is really high.
So it is not just about,
you know, our zoning
plan, it involves, a lot of other,
issues as well.
And so, we we know that
I'm very hopeful
that we passed this, family
zoning plan, but it does not mean
the next day that building will start.
It is we need to city, you know, interest
rates are likely to come down.
That's going to be important.
We have to work with our
our friends and labor
to make sure that the cost of labor
does not continue to be something
that makes it so that we don't have
people working and building.
What are you just give us the quick
synopsis of if this passes, what
will change from now to after your family,
the family zoning proposal?
Well,
I think it's just going to make it easier.
We have lots of, amendments
still to be worked on, to be quite honest,
that's going to protect,
rent controlled units of three or more,
that are in a building.
It is going to allow, for more housing
to get built more quickly
so you won't have to go through
as much of a process. But,
once again,
I don't think you're going to see
a huge difference, during at least,
let's say, my first term, we have to see
those other factors, play into it as well.
But I really think it's going to allow
the children
that are growing up in our city
to really dream that they can,
stay in San Francisco.
We had, independent analysis
that said it's going to drop rents
by between 800 and $1500 a month.
That's a huge difference for people.
So we are very hopeful that it allows
our city to become more affordable.
There's a there's a pushback often,
from people that say, this city's,
this plan will make it unaffordable.
I say the city is really unaffordable
right now.
People say this is going to hurt
small businesses.
I say it's going to provide,
more customers.
What we're going to see with
this plan is more density
along commercial corridors
and along transit lines.
That is where the bulk of,
the height will go up.
It'll go up to 6 to 8 stories
along commercial corridors.
And what I've told everybody
in residential neighborhoods,
we have basically four stories everywhere.
77% of our plan.
There are no height increases.
We're really protecting
our residential neighborhoods.
Our our our our jewels
that you all were talking about before.
And it's going to also help us
prevent our Ocean
beach from becoming Miami Beach,
which is a real fear that people have.
And I understand it,
and I don't want that.
I want our, you know, Sunset
and Richmond neighborhoods
to have retain their unique character.
You know, Joe,
I have yet to experience a rent decrease
in New York ever in my life.
You know, you're never going to get well.
I heard some people
call them in 2020, right?
But I wasn't here.
So, that's that's a novelty
seeing rents go down in a major city.
If it happens.
So what have your conversations
actually been like with developers?
What are they saying their needs actually
are in fulfilling some of this project?
To be quite honest, I haven't
had that many conversations,
with developers.
And when,
when I have, it's really around interest
rates, the cost of labor,
the cost of, construction.
I've had a lot more conversations
with people out,
in the west side, on the north side,
which is predominantly where this family
zoning plan, is focused because we we are
building in other parts of the city,
and the state is mandating in high
resourced neighborhoods.
And so, you know, we haven't
had a zoning change on the west side
of San Francisco since the 1970s.
So, that's important for people to know.
So I'm really speaking to people
that are understandably anxious, fearful,
and really trying to explain to them
that we have really listened
to them over this past year,
really making sure that height increases,
you won't see many of those,
but allowing people if they own a home to,
divided into two units, so that their kids
could stay there long term.
We this plan meets
the requirements of the state.
And I think it's a really thoughtful,
thoughtful, well laid out plan.
Shifting
gears a little bit in a few months,
we have left a lot of Democratic Party
politicians.
It's like we're opposing Trump's agenda,
whatever that means.
Opposing Trump's agenda,
protecting the city
or the state against Trump's, agenda.
You mentioned immigrants.
Do you feel that you have a responsibility
to protect
San Francisco's undocumented residents
against Trump's agenda?
Is that a useful thing?
I, I have a responsibility to take care of
San Franciscans
and everybody here in San Francisco.
I have a responsibility to protect people
coming in for a convention.
I have
responsibility
to take care of our communities.
And so I, I don't think about it
and, like, the microchip, but,
we have, our policies
in place, here in San Francisco
that have kept us safe.
They have kept us safe for decades.
When when you have the policies
that we have in place,
that make sure that local
law enforcement are not, you know,
tasked with federal immigration
enforcement that allows people
to report crime, that allows people
to take their kids to the hospital.
It allows, people,
it allows our city to stay safe.
And the numbers are bearing it out.
And I just keep reiterating,
that my focus is on keeping San
Francisco safe, and it's working.
You know,
we have the lowest homicide on record.
Homicide rate on record in terms of.
We haven't seen these numbers
since the 1950s.
Crime in our downtown is down 40%.
Crime citywide is down 30%.
So what we are doing,
is protecting the people of San Francisco.
We're protecting our visitors
and businesses.
Everyone is saying that it is working.
And so that's how I answer that question.
What advice do you have for the incoming
New York City mayor, whoever it may be?
But you that's the second time
you you too have asked me that question.
Not on my though.
Not on something cooperative.
I've talked to mayors across this country,
and many of us have have discussed that.
Staying focused on your people,
staying focused on,
your small businesses, focused on
your public schools is the way to go.
Like,
but once again,
I don't think other people in other cities
should be taking my advice.
I think they should be, doing
what works for them.
I'm doing what
I believe works best for San Francisco.
And right now I am feeling like.
And I think the vast majority of San
Franciscans are feeling like we're
heading in the right direction,
and I'm just going to keep my head down
and keep driving and getting results
for the people of San Francisco.
I'd love to end it on a very big picture.
Nice note about your great results.
I'm sure you'd like to end that there too,
but I have one last question
that's a little bit more specific.
A significant chunk of San Francisco's
budget operates through, nonprofits,
and I think there's a significant amount
New York and other cities as well.
How do taxpayers know that
that money is being well spent?
What is how do we know that
that is a good allocation,
these sort of private enterprises
that do services,
whether it's related to housing,
whether it's related to homelessness,
how do we, how do you
establish accountability such that
we know that these,
these are good allocations?
Yeah.
It, I think people should have a lot of,
of they should want answers on that front.
And we are working on it.
So I came into office in January.
We had an $870 million budget deficit,
the largest budget deficit
in our city's history.
We closed that with,
a mix of many things,
including, a hiring freeze
that we put into place immediately.
We cut 25% of the discretionary funding
that was available,
to cut, to, nonprofits,
which was incredibly difficult.
We are plugging in metrics.
This is what we pride
ourselves on at Tipping
Point was holding organizations
accountable, getting results.
And so we are working on that now.
So I came in in January.
The budget was due due in June.
So we it was a sprints essentially.
Most administrations
wait until January to start planning.
We put our budget
before the Board of Supervisors
and in late June,
it got passed on August 1st.
August 2nd.
We were planning for this upcoming budget.
And we are putting a accountability
measures into place on our contracts
to nonprofits.
But one thing I would say,
is that the non-profits
need to be held accountable,
but so do my departments.
I have some departments that don't pay
those nonprofit providers for 12 months.
We have small nonprofits floating,
city government
that has a $16 billion budget.
We are floating that money.
So we need to hold everyone accountable.
I and it starts with me.
We have a tremendous budget
in San Francisco.
We all know that it has not been spent
as well as it could be.
I'm. I was frustrated by that.
For years working at Tipping Point.
I saw it up close.
And now I want everybody to hold me
accountable in the years ahead.
But we're going to put metrics in place.
We're going to hold
nonprofits accountable,
and I'm gonna hold my department
heads accountable as well.
Mayor Lori,
thank you so much for coming on.
I'd like to hope to chat with you again
at some point.
And just so you two know,
we end everything in San Francisco
because we're on the rise.
We got to just share our, how great
San Francisco is going with a let's
go, San Francisco.
Okay,
Tracy, I would like to
believe that with many of this sort of,
you know, challenges,
I guess that big city is face.
I would like to believe
it's just a matter of will.
You know what I'm saying?
I would like to believe that all it takes
is someone saying, you know what?
We're going to be accountable.
We're committed
to addressing these things,
whether it's homelessness, whether it's
crime, whether it's public drug use, etc.
it would be nice
if the issues just resolved,
like wanting to do it,
you know what I'm saying?
I'm not sure like the way it sounds.
You know, talking to Mayor Lurie,
it sounds like one of the big changes
like, oh, I do.
We, as he put it, we used to have a live
and let live attitude,
and now that's not the case.
I would like to believe that
that really is the difference.
That is just like an attitude change.
I feel like there's a butt coming.
But you would like to believe.
But no, just like
if it's that simple of an attitude change,
then a lot of these things
could be solved.
I guess my butt is.
There's no.
But I just like.
I'm not sure if that's the case. Like,
yeah.
That's I guess. It's everybody.
But he certainly presents
a compelling argument.
I mean, I think like crime is down
in a lot of cities.
We know that it's spiked in 21, 20, 22,
the whole chaos post pandemic, etc.
it's been coming down everywhere.
I think there are a lot of mayors
that can point to a decline.
So what I'm saying is,
I would like to believe
that the decline in crime in San
Francisco can be pointed.
It's like, oh, we have a mayor
who now decided to tackle these things
as opposed to just sort of general trends.
Does that make sense? That makes sense.
One thing I will say
that I found very interesting was,
you know, he talked about that
ecosystem of tech companies.
Yeah.
And it kind of reminded me
of some of the conversations
we've had about tech development or even
manufacturing development in China.
And the idea that you know,
you can have a competitive advantage
because you know that
when you move to a certain place,
you're going to find, like an engineer
around the corner,
you're going to find
that particular programmer.
So I thought it was interesting to hear
that sort of echoed in San Francisco.
It's interesting that,
there's a lot to do.
I mean, it's interesting that
we used to talk more about the Bay area.
Yeah. Like, oh, yeah.
You know, and now it's really becoming
a San Francisco story.
And a lot of these AI companies, you know,
you don't hear about like one of those
random mountain Sunnyvale or Mount,
what's the one that Cupertino etc.
all these come, you know, like all of the
and that's its own fascinating thing,
which is that
AI does not strike me as a Bay area story.
We didn't have a great time
to get into this, but I does not strike me
as a Bay area story
so much as it's a San Francisco story.
These are San Francisco companies,
and they're not just like somewhere
like down the peninsula or whatever.
It's funny, now that you mention that.
Yeah, I'm thinking like Bay area.
Seriously, a term
I have not heard for a very long time.
Isn't it interesting?
Like the Bay area is,
or even Silicon Valley?
Yeah, it's an interesting phenomenon
because when it comes to hard tech,
when it comes to manufacturing,
I have a very intuitive understanding
of why agglomeration matters.
Right?
You want to be able to like, get this
provider and distance really matters.
It's not intuitive to me in the same way.
Why with something like any software,
let alone I thought it would be such a
tight cluster.
And yet it does seem to be,
a very tight cluster there.
Well, there seems to be a network effect.
Yeah, some sort.
Totally know why that is.
In the same way the network effects exists
with, say, manufacturing,
because we remember 2020 work
from home, work from anywhere, slack
exists, IP exists, etc.
and yet everyone's together there.
We didn't get too much into this,
but I do think that's
an interesting reason to be interested
in San Francisco right now.
For sure. Shall we leave it
there? Let's leave it there.
All right.
