I talk about how there is no such thing
as passive investing a lot.
More than I should,
because it annoys a lot of people.
But there's a lot of people
who demonize passive investing,
and I think for kind of phony reasons.
And a big part of that is this fact
that, you know, the reason I talk about
and try to quantify the global
financial asset portfolio is because
I was trying to create a benchmark for
if we were going to define something
as passive as,
you know, truly passive to me is you're
buying the full market portfolio.
You're not deviating at all.
You're not making
any active decisions at all.
And so when you quantify the gap,
you can actually create a benchmark there
where you understand, okay,
well this is the only if you are truly
fully 100% passive,
this is the only thing you would own.
Everyone's active.
And you know, there's
very smart ways to be active
and there's very stupid ways to be active.
And I would say that,
you know, a lot of the things,
the most sort of disconcerting thing
that I see going on these days is that
I see the issuance of a lot of strategies,
and especially with the rise of crypto,
there's a lot of things going on that
I would describe as stupid active, where
people are more having like a gambling
mentality approaching
all of this than than anything else.
Hello and welcome to another episode
of the Odd Lots Podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal.
And I'm Tracy Alloway.
Tracy, I know like everyone is like really
into what's the hot stock these days?
Nvidia how do I play the AI boom?
It's interesting.
You can make a lot of money
and get the right stocks.
I love the general topic of
just like optimal portfolio
construction,
it seems like a fascinating puzzle to me
how to fit different types of assets
together in one coherent thing.
It always felt to me
like a study in behavioral science.
Yeah, most
because I think everyone always says,
you know, just invest in an index fund.
It maybe 6040, although as we saw in 2022,
that has its own problems
and we can talk about that.
But I think this is like
the one area in people's lives
where they actually crave complexity.
Right?
Like it doesn't sound right to be like.
I know, just.
Put your money in an index fund
and forget about. It.
I know it's like the simplest
it's like the simplest investing strategy
is the hardest. Yeah.
For people, it's really hard to do like
when you see people making life changing.
An amount of money is like,
oh, I was in, you know, SanDisk, right?
And suddenly everyone wants memory
for because of AI and they're up 500%
and you're like, damn, you know,
like I'm really happy with my 12% year
that I've been making,
but I really it's really hard.
I was 100% invested in the leveraged
Doge ETF.
Right? Yeah. Right.
Like if you did that and then you retired
the next day, I'd be like really annoyed.
I'd be like a fairly I'm sad, but
but it is a fun puzzle.
You mentioned 2022 and we saw, of course,
what we've seen really since Covid,
what we've really seen since,
the worst inflation in 40 years
is that some of these,
portfolio constructions that worked
very well for very long time, particularly
anything that sort of resembles
that 60 or 40 thing,
which just worked
so beautifully in the 20 tens.
But even before it hasn't worked as well.
I think it's still doing fairly well.
But yeah.
So it gets you the question is like, well,
I remember we asked Bill gross
why even own bonds at a time?
He was like, well don't. Yeah he don't.
He's like, I'm in I'm in pipelines.
That's where, that's right.
I'm getting by or I'm in
whatever my MLP is or whatever.
That's how I'm getting my yield.
But yeah, I think
there's some real question about like
why own treasuries, why or whatever, etc..
Well, the other thing is timing, like
this is the thing
that everyone has to consider, right?
So in 2022, if you were about to take out
a big chunk of your portfolio
to buy a house, or if you were a retiree
and you needed to make
some chunky payment,
you were really, really unlucky in 2022.
If you were, if you had taken everyone's
advice and invested in a 6040 portfolio.
So this is the other thing.
Like you can try to smooth out returns,
but your own spending
is going to go up and down quite a bit.
There's one other issue that I think a lot
about, with sort of the very standard,
and it sort of relates exactly to this
with the sort of standard advice.
So in theory,
it's like we're not supposed to time
the market by the highs,
you buy the lows, etc..
It was 2020 was a great time to buy.
March 2020 would have been a fantastic
time to buy.
The problem is layoffs surged.
And there's this sort of phenomenon
where often
the best time to invest in the market are
when you don't have a job and you don't.
Really need money.
And actually, yeah, they always say, don't
sell, don't panic, sell at the bottom.
There's a good chance
that's when you might need to sell.
That's
maybe when you lose your job or something.
So I the the ability
to sort of mechanically actually follow
the rules is setting aside
behavioral stuff.
Just the ability to like have the income
or have the ability to like,
hold through drawdowns, buy the dips, etc.
may not even be possible.
Absolutely.
Well, anyway, I'm excited to say
we really do have the perfect guest,
someone we've had on the podcast before.
Also someone we've just known
for a very long time.
One of the most interesting thinkers
in the realms of sort of
investing in portfolio managing.
And so forth, a voice of sanity, I would
say, which is very rare these days.
We're going to be speaking
with Cullen Roche
He is the founder of Discipline Funds,
and he is the author of a brand new book
called Your Perfect Portfolio
about exactly this topic.
So, Cullen, thank you so much
for coming back on the podcast.
It's nice to see you. Nice to be here.
What would you rate this book?
Well, this is a problem that
I've always run into throughout running
my business is that I,
I think as the portfolio manager
and financial advisor,
I've run into this issue where
I'm trying to construct a model portfolio
that is ideal for my business
so that I can easily implement
something, and then kind of just plug
and play it in the client portfolios.
And what I've realized
over the course of managing money for,
you know, however long it's
been now, multiple decades, is that
everyone's different and everyone needs
their own level of customization.
And so it's very hard to just take a model
portfolio and then plug and play in the,
you know, the kind of funny thing
with the financial services
industry is it's largely built around
these ideas that you take a product
and then you sell it to the client.
And oftentimes
what I find is that when you're trying
to sell the product to the client,
it just doesn't mesh with their needs.
And so everyone needs to find
their own perfect portfolio.
So the book isn't
titled The Perfect Portfolio.
And the purpose of the book really is to
what I do is
I go through a number
of sort of famous portfolios,
and some of them are very boring
and some of them are more sophisticated.
But the overarching ethos of the book
is that you have to sort of understand
all these different approaches,
and then you can plug and play the way
that you want to build your own perfect
portfolio so that it works for you.
One thing I'm curious about, because,
I've never had a professional
financial advisor or anything,
but how do you actually evaluate
your client's needs?
Like what do those questions look like?
I imagine, you know, they're
probably a lot of finances involved,
but are there questions like,
how do you feel about losing 40%
of your portfolio in a single year?
That's actually that's my
my very favorite question.
Okay.
The question I hate the most
because for, I don't know, 20 years,
I used to print out these phony risk
profile questionnaires
and I would send them to people.
And one of the questions is always,
you know, how do you respond to a market
that falls 30 or 40%?
And literally
98% of people will answer that question
the exact same way,
because they know the right answer.
They'll say, oh, I stay the course,
I will buy the dip or whatever.
And then Covid happens and, you know,
50% of my clients are calling me like,
this has never happened before.
What the hell do we do
now? This is terrifying.
We need to sell everything right?
And I'm there, you know, and even I'm
looking at that, and I'm kind of like,
you know, because in the throes of it.
Yeah, that's the hard part
about investing into a bear market,
especially when it's actually going on.
It all feels right, feels justified.
Totally.
And you're looking at it.
One of my favorite charts in the book
is a chart of the Great Depression
downturn, and it shows this like horrific
80% downturn
where the market just went down
like every month
for basically 3 or 4 years,
and it goes down a full 80%.
And when you're in the throes
of that sort of 30 or 40%
downturn that we saw, say,
during the GFC or during Covid,
you're thinking to yourself, well,
wait a minute,
I know that this the market has gone down
60, 70, 80% in the past.
So if we're at 40,
that means we probably have another,
you know, 40% haircut or cut
coming down the line.
And so that's the psychology of it
when people are actually in the middle
of it.
And I remember vividly during Covid
because even people like Buffett
and Bill gates, like some of the
the most practical thinkers in the world,
they're sitting around there saying,
this has never happened before.
We've never seen this.
No one living has seen
what is going on right now.
And so it all feels rational.
And then, you know, so from a risk
profiling perspective,
it's really difficult because
that sort of subjective nature of it
all is really sort of irrelevant,
because when you're actually in it,
it all will feel totally rational.
Now remember thinking that even like
obviously April of last year
during, the brief but very sharp
selloff, after Liberation Day
and it's like, well, Trump
just changed the rules of capitalism.
This is going to be
this is really different or going back
to Covid like the yeah, we all say we're
going to, just hold through the downturn.
But in that moment we're like,
oh no, this isn't really this is well,
this is not like the other sell.
This is different.
This is not like.com
or there was just an overvaluation.
This is not like 1991
when we had a fed engineered recession.
This is something different.
The old rules about buying and holding
must not apply this.
Yeah it's funny. You know,
I see a lot of people get mocked.
A lot of the analysts back then were,
you know,
they were changing their estimates
and they kind of,
you know, after the
the tariffs more or less got scrapped.
They then, you know, up there at their
estimates for the year on targets.
And in retrospect,
that looks kind of stupid.
But in the throes of it,
if you remember, like they were saying
they were going to replace the income tax.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Like I'm writing,
you know, they're doing the math on that.
And I'm like, wait a minute, that's a $2.5
trillion corporate or a tax increase.
Like that's a gigantic number,
an incredibly frightening number
if it's true.
And then, you know, of course,
the CEOs of Home Depot and Target
and all them walk into the white House,
they're like, do not do this.
And so they're still doing the tariffs
and they're still impactful and they're
still a corporate tax and whatnot.
But they're not nearly the size
that you know they were going to be.
You know, they were claiming to be.
And so the that frightening moment
where, you know,
they announced that,
you know, got quickly scrapped.
And you know, when they, when they were
kind of reversed course on it.
I feel like we should note here
that we're recording on January 8th,
and we are expecting the Supreme Court
to make a decision on the tariffs.
So the entire game could change again.
Change again. Yeah.
You mentioned the Great Depression.
And one thing I thought
was really interesting in the book is you
talk about how no one really quite knows
the origins of the 6040 portfolio,
even though it's become
fairly standard in finance,
but you trace it
back to the Great Depression.
So tell us how you did that.
Yeah.
Well, I don't know if I did do it
correctly, but it was kind of a guess.
But I you know,
I found that so fascinating that 6040
is arguably the most famous portfolio
of all the portfolios.
And we all probably own
something that kind of looks like 6040
at some point in our lives.
And it was actually Corey Hoff Steen from,
who, manages the return
stacking ETF that he asked on Twitter
one day, where did this thing come from?
And there were hundreds of responses
and none of them seemed right.
And so I just had so happened
to be writing the book at this time,
and I'm writing the chapter on 6040,
and I started digging into it
and had found the story about this guy
named Walter Morgan, who's running a fund
called the Wellington Fund and Wellington
Fund, obviously, you know, famous
because it turns into a Vanguard
fund later is run by John Bogle,
who some people may have heard of
and he's doing this, though
in a very unusual way,
back in the depression, where
during the depression, equity
investing was kind of the dominant way
to actually allocate assets.
And Morgan had been burned before that.
And so he goes into the Great Depression.
He launches the Wellington fund
right before the depression.
But he does something really unusual.
He adds a huge chunk of bonds
to the portfolio,
and the thing gets crushed
in the depression,
but it gets crushed way
less than everything else got crushed.
And so then all of these research
analysts are starting to look at,
you know, kind of,
you know, picking through the dust of the
Great Depression and the returns there.
And they're noticing that, hey, this fund
did really well in the relative sense.
And so Morgan's fund kind of takes off
because of this,
because the relative performance
was so good.
And then the story is interesting because
then Walter Morgan hires John Bogle.
Bogle runs the Wellington Fund through,
you know, the fund goes through the World
War two when the, the boom of the 1960s
and then the scary
inflation of the 1970s, Bogle actually
does something really weird.
He turns the fund closer into like an 80,
20 fund kind of chasing performance,
and which is sort of like antithetical
to everything that Bogle ultimately
is kind of known for.
And then we all know the story from there.
The 6040, from 1980 to,
you know, present day has been,
you know, kind of like one of the best
performing portfolios ever.
So it's,
you know, through all of these trials
and tribulations, though,
this portfolio has done incredibly well,
and I traced its origin mostly
back to the Great Depression in the way
that Wellington Fund was sort of built
as the first real balanced index fund.
It's actually you zoom out
or back up a little bit and talk theory,
because you said that many of us
or most of us will have some portfolio
that is 60, 40 ish, but then there's
going to be various modifications
and people are going to, want to slug
of real estate or commodities, whatever.
But what do you talk about?
Maybe from the academic perspective,
like what is the 6040 portfolio really is?
And like what is it theoretically achieved
that is given it this sort of it's
Lindy, this sort of enduring effect
that it accomplishes.
Go and talk to us about like why
from the perspective of a planner,
maybe it's not perfect for everyone,
but it has certain qualities.
Yeah, this is a good portfolio to me.
The 6040
is like the good enough portfolio.
It just to be just to define it.
So a 6040 portfolio means basically
60% equities and 40% treasuries.
Exactly.
Okay. But talk about why it's good enough.
What is it. What are the properties of it.
So it's the portfolio that by owning
60% stocks you will you'll do well enough.
You'll capture
enough of an equity market bull market.
And also conversely, during a bear market,
because of the 40% bond slice,
you typically will buffer
the equity volatility in the portfolio
just enough that you won't capture
all of the downside.
And so it's it is balanced in this way
that it it doesn't capture
all of the upside or all of the downside
and kind of can help you stay the course.
I talked specifically in one chapter
about something called the Global
Financial Asset Portfolio.
And I really like understanding
this portfolio, especially from like a
theoretical perspective,
because the most
interesting thing about it
actually,
is that nobody owns this portfolio
because it's mostly, investable
or you can't fully invested.
And it's actually,
you know,
I talked to a lot of famous researchers
about this topic
when I was researching the book,
and they all kind of concluded
that the screwy is part
about actually quantifying
that portfolio is that
it's actually really controversial
how to quantify it,
because all of the assets
in that portfolio are not investable.
So, for instance, like China,
A-shares are not necessarily investable
for foreign investors.
And there's lots of assets that are held
by, you know, the Swiss National Bank owns
a lot of assets that make the assets
they're own investable.
And so, you know, the fed has been buying
a lot of Treasury bonds.
So technically you could say,
you know what happens to the market cap
of outstanding bonds when the fed is
the owner of a lot of these bonds.
And you can start getting into these sort
of very academic
theoretical debates about, well,
what is the market portfolio and what's
actually investable versus UN investable.
And it's especially interesting
from like a, a theoretical.
And in theory, that portfolio includes
like gas stations in Burma, right?
Yeah.
Well, God,
if you go into all of the assets,
you know, I did financial assets
on which I kind of excluded
all the non-financial assets.
So things
because then then the whole portfolio
kind of turns
into a real estate portfolio.
Okay.
So basically everybody's houses
is everything that we own.
But from a financial asset perspective,
it was really interesting
because especially when you look at things
like the full cap versus the free flow,
which is basically the the actual assets
you can invest in versus the portfolio
that is actually the issuance
of outstanding financial assets.
These portfolios are really different.
And if you like, for instance,
in today's environment, the outstanding
market cap of of stocks
versus bonds is roughly 6535.
And when you look at the, sorry,
the equity market, when you look at the
the U.S. versus
foreign, it's 65 versus 35.
But when you look at the actual issuance,
the full cap, it's almost the opposite.
And so the U.S is way
smaller from a full issuance perspective,
but from an actual investable perspective,
the US is,
you know, what we call like
this extraordinary market, this unusual,
huge part of the full market cap
and which is weird to think of
because when Vanguard
and some of these big index funds
create these products,
they have to issue what is investable.
They can't just say theoretically, like I
sometimes will tell my clients, well,
hey, if you want to actually own
the true market cap portfolio
or the market issuance portfolio,
you should actually be closer to like 40%
U.S, you should be underweight the U.S.
market versus foreign in this environment
because that actually is representative
of the full issuance.
Whereas if you're Vanguard
and you're running this index
and you have to buy
what has actually been issued,
it's almost the exact opposite
and you're way overweight.
U.S so you get into these interesting
sort of like theoretical debates
about how to even do this
in the first place.
I want to talk more about illiquid
assets like real estate,
because for most people
this is their biggest investment, right?
Their actual house.
But before I do, you just reminded
me, gold.
So in the book you talk about gold as like
one of the true uncorrelated assets.
But of course, over the course of last
year, it looks like a momentum stock.
Right.
How are you judging gold
at this moment in time?
You know,
gold and commodities are really hard
to compartmentalize into the portfolio
construction process because I
typically think of commodities in general
as they're
just they roughly track inflation
because they are just cost inputs in,
you know, corporate, you know, costs.
And so they should roughly reflect
something close historically
to the rate of inflation,
which is pretty close
to what the data shows.
Gold is a really screwy one because gold
has this whole other element to it
where there is huge
swaths of the population
that view gold as money, even though,
you know, in a modern monetary system,
you could argue that gold is actually
a pretty terrible form of money
just because it's impractical to use
for the most part.
So it's it's got this store of value
in this sort of I refer to it
as a faith put inside of it,
where its price almost gets like a premium
because it's not just an input
in, you know, cost inputs.
It is something that people believe
in, that people hold and people
have demand for
because it's got this other strange use.
And so it's weird
in the context of today's environment.
Another concept I talk about
is I talk a lot about time in the book
about how important it is
to think about portfolios and asset
performance across time horizons.
And, you know,
I do a lot of asset liability matching,
and that basically entails working
with somebody where I'm quantifying
liabilities and expenses over time
horizons, and I'm matching assets.
And in not dissimilar way
to like maybe a big pension
fund would or banks might operate.
And that's all about understanding time
and an asset liability mismatch.
And if you get that wrong you end up
like Silicon Valley Bank and which you.
Talk about in the book. Yeah.
And the interesting thing
about even like a retail investor,
you know, and it took me for,
you know, two decades
working in the business to realize this,
that the better way to go through a risk
profiling process is not to ask people
phony questions
about the subjective nature
of how they feel
in a bear market or something like that.
It's figuring out it's solving that asset
liability mismatch.
Because what happens to an investor
when they go through a bear
market is they're realizing
that they own too much of.
I refer to equities as long duration
instruments.
Corporations are very long
term entities by design, by function.
And when someone owns 100% stock portfolio
and they go through a big bear market,
what happens to them is they're
if they get scared, they're realizing,
I don't have enough safe assets
to make me feel comfortable with this.
So if they own the 40% slice
like the 6040,
maybe they feel more comfortable.
Or if they own, you know, there's
a whole chapter on what I call the T-bill
and chill portfolio, which is like
the Liquid Reserve portfolio.
You know, I heard a story.
I don't know if it's true. It,
speaking of 2 billion.
Sure.
Though, I don't know if it's true,
but because I heard the second hand,
someone was telling me there was, like,
some famous, like, very, very successful
trader, like Goldman Sachs,
who was, like, trading commodities,
pulling down millions
and millions of dollars each year.
And he just, like,
had all his money in T-bills.
He's like, look, I don't need like my
I make a ton of money.
I just like basically want to save it.
I don't know if that's even true,
but I do wonder.
So when we were talking about alternate
ways of assessing risk profile,
do you think about like try to get a sense
of the client income volatility.
So like maybe someone who,
you know, a federal judge
who is going to have a job for life, etc.
at a guaranteed pension,
maybe they don't make a ton of money,
but you were very confident
that you could predict their income
for the next 50 years. Maybe.
Whereas someone who makes a lot of money,
but they're like a real estate
developer in Miami,
and the odds of those guys
going broke
every ten years is pretty high, etc..
Talk to us about like sort of that role
of calculating expected.
And yeah, it's.
It's arguably, I would say the most
important part of the whole equation
because one of the things I talk about in
the book is I frame your human capital
and your income
as a literal fixed income allocation.
So I almost like to think of your income
in your job as like a bond allocation.
And so in the context of like, you know,
someone like you're talking about
or let's use
an even simpler example of someone who's,
you know, 25
and they make a decent amount of money.
That person
not only has a really long time horizon,
but if they've got a really stable job,
they've got this embedded fixed
income allocation that maybe they don't
actually quantify it like that on a,
you know, portfolio statement, but.
That has a net present value.
That's exactly, you know,
so if the the really simple example is
if you make 100 grand a year in, you know,
you could almost think of that
as I've got $1 million bond
that earns 10% a year.
And what that does, especially
if it's a very stable fixed income,
it frees up a huge amount of behavioral
bandwidth for you to take other risks.
And that's one of the arguments
why, if you're 25 and you've got,
you know, 40 years to retirement
or whatever, and you've got a stable,
you know, solid income, well,
you can think of your, your income versus
your balance sheet as being super stable,
which allows you to take a lot of risk
with your balance sheet
that you might not otherwise have.
And that's
another thing
I talk a lot about retirement
planning in the book, because the thing
that I've seen very front and center
is that when people get close to 65,
that income issue becomes
hugely important
because people start to realize that,
oh, crap, that fixed income allocation
that I've had all these years, it's about
to just disappear overnight
or it's about to shrink down to whatever
your Social Security income
is or whatever.
And so people go through this sort of
psychological mind trick
where when they near retirement
and then enter retirement,
they struggle with that,
you know, adapting to this big,
big change in their income
because they're realizing that, hey,
I don't have this fixed income
that I could fall back on
for the last 40 years.
Is investing time
horizon more important than macro?
Because in the book
you do talk about the importance of macro.
But on the other hand,
if people are reacting to
a changing economy
all the time, then that looks a lot
like what
you're not supposed to do, right?
Yeah.
I mean, gosh, I generally in my practice
I am constantly trying to downplay
macro he cod and geopolitics
and things like that.
I mean, it's funny, you know,
the reason that I probably even know
you guys is because I've written
so much about macro econ
and I'm not an economist, but people,
I think, sometimes think of me
as a macro thinker, in large part
because I've spent so much of my career
fielding bad questions about,
you know, hey, is the US government
going bankrupt or you know,
what is going on with China?
And I'm trying to sort of
write about this stuff,
not because it's important in this, the,
you know, the context of portfolio
construction, but because it's more
so about understanding how these things
operate it, more of a sort
of a first principles level where you can
you can look at a bond allocation
if you own a huge slug of, you know, U.S.
Treasury bonds, for instance, or T-bills,
you know, you can look at these things
when you understand them
more mechanically,
you can look at these things and say,
okay, well, the odds of the US government
actually going
bankrupt are extraordinarily low
because I understand
how these things function.
I understand that the the U.S government
is not going to run out of money.
I understand that, you know,
maybe bond vigilantes aren't
quite as powerful as we've all been told.
And you can understand these things
in the context of owning something
so that you're more comfortable
with what you're doing.
And that's that's actually
the hardest part about all of this is that
it's all very complex
and it's all very emotional.
And if you don't understand what you own,
then you won't be comfortable with it
and you won't stick with it.
I bought a house in 2016.
I think it's done all right,
but sometimes I'm like, man,
I really wish I just put that all to Q-q
or something like that.
And then the other thing with houses
that I think is interesting, which is like
you could look at
maybe I'll say you own a house outright
and it's like, oh, this is worth
$1 million or something like that.
You can really sell it
because then you have to buy a house.
And so it's like, I'm not even sure,
like I got to live somewhere.
And so I know you can't monetize that
to the same degree.
You could,
you know, sell your stock and buy stuff.
But talk to us about how one should think,
let's start that, how one should think
about the role of their home
in their overall portfolio.
It's the hardest asset to buy,
I think, because it is
it's an instrument
that you want to generate a return on.
So you want to do
like some financial analysis on it
and, you know, try to
nobody wants to buy a house in,
you know, 2007 or something
and then see it go down 30%.
But also your house is where you live.
It's where you're going to raise your kids
and you're going to eat
most of your meals,
and you're going to do
all the little boring things in life
that are actually really important to you.
And so there's this really personal
part of it that it makes the
to some degree, it throws
all the financial math out the window.
But from a basic, you know, first of all,
going back to your 2016 purchase,
I would say, you know,
that was unbelievable timing because.
Oh, thank you. For the.
Thank you.
The you could argue that
going through Covid,
I mean, any house that was leveraged,
did you have a mortgage.
Yeah. Yeah.
So any house that was leveraged
was the best inflation hedge right.
Maybe maybe the best inflation
hedge trade of the last 50 years.
You could argue just in terms of just
providing this stable level of certainty.
Yeah.
You know the low mortgage is an inflation
hedge.
The you got 50% price appreciation
or probably something like that.
So but that's interesting too,
to think about that when you're kind
of going back to the question of gold
that I didn't fully answer.
What happens when an asset goes up
so much in the short term?
The way I like to think of it at least,
is that let's say that housing
typically generates, a low real return or,
you know, even historically
it hasn't generated a real return.
The way that I like to think
about things like that are environments
where you get these,
what I call a price compression.
You get a huge boom in an asset class.
And it's it's almost easier to think of
this in like a fixed income market
where like when the when the bond market
goes down, a lot of interest rates go up.
The math completely changes on. All right.
So a lot of people
these days are saying like bonds are dead.
And I would say like no, bonds
are actually probably more attractive
because mathematically
from a yield perspective
relative to the falling price decline, the
the future returns are much more stable
now, much more probable.
And so what happens in an environment
where you get a 50% increase
in real estate or a, you know,
what was gold up last year, 65%?
You know, let's say that let's
just be generous and say gold is going
to continue to do 8% per year
for the next, you know, however many years
when you get 65% of that return
all crunched down into one year,
I think what happens is
you create a higher probability of what
a financial advisor would call sequence
of returns risk, which means that
the probability that the future returns
are going to be much more volatile
becomes much higher.
And so that's one thing with real estate
is that, like, I'm not super optimistic
about future real estate prices for now
because we went through this big boom.
It creates this price compression
and you get lots of returns into one year
all crammed up.
And that means that the likelihood
of either sideways or sort of,
you know, not
great returns is is pretty probable.
So, you know, going forward,
you know, I think that it's, it's good
to think of your house as basically a,
it's a block of commodities,
and an appreciating piece of land.
And, you know, the thing that's important
with real estate is I talk about this
a lot in the book,
that you have to think of everything
in terms of real, real returns.
And that means you have to back out
inflation
and you have to back out
all the other costs.
And that's the thing that you know, I,
I have probably the worst housing story
in the world, because in 2017,
I bought a house in California
that had a small waterway on it.
And without knowing that
which I should have probably known
in the state of California,
anything with
water on it in the state of California is
basically the biggest permitting nightmare
that you could possibly imagine.
It gets the EPA involved,
it gets the Coastal Commission involved,
it gets the state Department of Fish
and Wildlife involved.
And all of a sudden
you get an introspective
look at, you know,
how all these government agencies
work together.
Now, I'm really curious,
what were you trying to do?
We were literally
just trying to remodel the house. Yeah.
So we bought this whole.
You weren't touching the water at all?
No, we weren't touching the water at all.
And in fact, the the water is not even.
I mean, San Diego gets ten inches of rain
a year, so,
you know, that's very, very little rain.
And so this waterway we call it is really
it's not only has water in it,
I mean ten days a year
something it's crazy.
It's dry. It's not like it's
a lagoon or something.
This is why. Is it how you're libertarian?
Yeah.
Well, it's really funny
because my, my wife is very, very liberal.
And we were going
through the permitting process
and she was like, these people are trying
to turn me into a libertarian.
No, I get it.
Oh, actually, since you brought up
your wife, I got to ask.
There's there's a bit in the book
where you talk about marrying a portfolio,
and then you have a tiny footnote
that says, apologies to my wife.
And then it says, I'm just testing
if my wife actually reads this.
Did she read it? She caught it.
She she actually
was the first editor of the book.
So she and she did go through it
and she caught it.
She didn't just jam
it all through GPT, which she,
she kept trying to convince me to do.
But no,
it's funny, there's another footnote
about my mother in law in there that,
she has not caught yet.
Oh, what's what's that?
I didn't see that was.
So she got trapped with us during Covid.
And, I make the joke that I had just
had my first daughter right after Covid.
And, you know, the shutdown happens.
The international travel shutdown happens.
She lives in France,
so she was just happened to be visiting us
for the the baby's arrival.
And she gets trapped
with us for six months.
And I make this joke
about how I was crying in the shower
every morning, not because of the baby.
Screaming into a sock.
I think it's
just going back to bonds for a second.
It is true
that, you know, you see investors
behave in exactly the opposite way
that they should be behaving
when it comes to bonds.
If you like bonds at a 2% yield,
you should love them at like a 7% you.
Right.
What you're talking about just now with
gold and real estate is a momentum factor.
Right.
And momentum seems to have done
very very well over the past few years.
I mean this is why we say flows before it
froze.
Right.
Can we just follow
what everyone else is doing.
That seems to be the way now.
Yeah I gosh
I mean there's there's momentum.
There's the momentum factor
and the momentum factor.
And this is the more academic version
of your portfolio construction
where in the Factor investing chapter,
I talk very specifically about,
you know, it's called
cross-sectional momentum basically.
And this is basically picking the stocks
that have performed
well in the past with the expectation
that they continue to perform
well in the future.
And they they weirdly, the the data
actually shows that that is a thing.
And so it frustrates
people like Gene Fama.
Yeah. Of the efficient market hypothesis.
But it's it's interesting
because in the context of today's world,
that momentum factor
is basically just everything tech,
everything that's performed the best.
And so you're which has, you know,
weirdly continued to work and work
and work throughout the years.
And so you. Got this
like self-reinforcing cycle.
Right? Yeah.
And there's also, you know, the
the one chapter that I actually thought
was almost even more interesting
than the momentum one is one
that's related, which is called the trend
following chapter.
And that is very different in the sense
that these guys, these traders are
they're not necessarily just looking
at the past and trying to, you know,
they're not picking stocks necessarily
and then extrapolating it into the future.
These guys are just trying to find trends
and they're looking
maybe they're looking at,
you know, chart data or whatever.
But and they're it's a go
anywhere strategy.
So one of the most interesting things
about this strategy is that it
is one of the truly, fully uncorrelated
strategies to everything else.
And it's had this sort of big resurgence
in the last.
It became very popular after the GFC
because it yeah, it beat the pants
off of everything and was uncorrelated,
had these huge asymmetric returns
and then went through this period
of like a ten year lag.
And it had kind of like
what I was referring to earlier
where you had this
like you had that price compression.
The the trend following things
all went up.
All these CTA funds go up,
you know, 50, 100%.
And then they all lagged for
and they lagged for a long time.
And that's the thing about finding
uncorrelated assets is that sometimes
these uncorrelated instruments,
they're not like cash flow
generating instruments
like stocks and bonds necessarily.
So the the trend followers though
they go through this ten year
period of lagging and which exposes people
to all these behavioral biases.
I remember CTAs also became
a really convenient scapegoat for it.
Oh yeah.
That was happening in the market.
They were like the multi strats.
Yeah, right.
I forgot how much we used
to talk about CTA in the early 20 tens
as an important driver, actually.
Can we talk a little bit
about tech stocks for a second.
Because this strikes me as very important.
And I think about this all the time.
You know you see these surveys is that
Bank of America does have fund managers.
Like what's the most crowded
trade in the world. Tech.
They've been saying that since like 2013,
you know, and it's still just performs.
And all these other
there are all kinds of other
knock on things,
you know, it's like people talking about
U.S versus international exposure.
But at the end of the day,
this is sort of just a bet on tech
when we're talking about the U.S.
And the other thing
I think about tech a lot
is that setting aside sort of theories
of portfolio construction, these companies
make gobs of money and they make more
and more and more and more each year.
You know, we recently did an episode and,
Ben Snyder, the top equity
strategist at goal of Goldman was on.
He's like, well, the big tech companies,
it's like 33% of S&P 500 earnings.
And I listen to that.
It's like, well, that's another 67%
of total earnings for them to gobble up.
But it strikes me that like
can you just tell it like
it must drive portfolio managers crazy
that there's this one sector and you know,
this is a novelty, right?
Because these are big companies that are
growing faster than almost anyone else,
which is not the case
in many environments.
When we associate big companies
with maturity and slow growth.
So like there is this thing going on
for years and years and years
that just sort of feels
to bust every other strategy.
And if not overweight tech,
they're probably underperforming.
Yeah.
And it's really it's frustrated
the hell out of people,
especially the factor investors
who haven't been in the momentum trade,
who have been more value oriented or,
you know, the people who know that small
has outperformed large in the long run,
like it's all been flipped on its head.
Yeah.
So I again, going back to the
the time horizon thing
the way that at least I try to think about
this is tech
and growth is really interesting
in the current environment
because in going back to the Nasdaq
bubble, you can actually,
you know,
a lot of people make that corollary.
And the interesting thing about the Nasdaq
bubble is that if you bought
the very tippy top of the Nasdaq bubble
and held on to today,
you've made like 8% per year.
This is great.
You've done really, really well,
which is crazy.
But you had this crazy
sequence of returns risk because yeah,
yeah, especially in real terms.
You went through this traumatic
like 15 year downturn over that period.
But the so the interesting thing,
you know, compared to
then is that, like you said,
these entities are completely different.
Like everybody was expecting
the internet to be a big thing.
And it was.
And everybody expects
A.I. to be a big thing.
And I think it will be.
But the interesting difference
between that environment
and this environment
is that these companies
are they make more money than any entities
have ever in human existence.
So this is completely different
than they did every year.
They beat analyst expert.
It's crazy.
And they're growing crazy crazy fast.
So it's almost unbelievable.
But the the thing is kind of going back
to that whole idea
of like price compression
and thinking about time horizons.
The way I think about it
is that and I write about this
specifically in, in
probably my favorite chapter to write in
this book was an original strategy
that I call the forward cap portfolio.
And what I did was
I took five huge macroeconomic trends,
and I distilled them all down.
And I tried to extrapolate data
out into the future.
And one of the big ones is tech, where
I look at something like, e-commerce,
retail sales.
And I say, you know, this is currently
whatever it is, 25% of all e-commerce
retail sales,
as a percentage of total retail
sales, it's 25%.
And that number, you know,
is probably going to go to 50 or 60 or 70%
at some point in the future, all retail
sales will just turn into e-commerce sales
at some point, like you said.
Like, you know, this is there's 75%
more for e-commerce to double up.
I believe. That.
And so if you believe that
and you want to buy technology, well,
what should you own?
Should you own the market cap weighting of
35% like it is now in the S&P 500?
Or should you go to like 50 or 60%?
And the way I kind of frame it in
the book is it's skating to where the puck
maybe is going, rather than when you buy
a market cap weighted index fund.
What you're doing is
you're basically skating with the puck,
which is it's a good strategy.
It works really well,
but you're not necessarily trying to skate
to where the puck is going.
And so I'm doing a lot of guesswork.
It's obviously very active.
And, you know, there's a lot of there's
a lot of estimates
that are involved in all of this.
But if you think forward, like,
I don't think it's unreasonable
to say that in 40 or 50 years,
the market cap of technology in the S&P
500 might be 5060, 70%.
Who knows?
Like everything's
probably turning into a two years.
But the tricky part about that
is that when especially when valuations
are really high,
I talk about how valuations
are the equivalent of high expectations.
And when expectations are really high,
it doesn't take much to disappoint.
And so your your margin for error
when expectations are really high
is just really low.
And so what that does
is it causes this potential
where you have higher sequence of returns
risk in the short term, where,
you know,
I would say if I'm talking to, you know,
a 20 year old who's coming out of college
who just got a great job on Wall Street
or something, I might tell him, well,
hey, your your time horizon is so long
and you could be so aggressive,
you should maybe just go buy a growth
fund and just, you know, lose the password
to your brokerage account for, like,
four years. Yeah.
And open it up
and you'll probably have done really well.
But if you look at that thing
in five years, it might be down 50%.
You don't know.
And so that's the way I kind of frame it.
And so if you're if you're very time
sensitive, I would say, you know, the
the retiree who is retiring next year
and they're loaded
to the gills
with Nvidia and Google and Microsoft.
That person has a totally different
risk exposure than that 20 year old does.
How do you think about the index providers
in this equation?
Because,
you know, there's this perception
that you put your money in an index fund.
It's a passive investment,
but actually it's kind of active
because the index provider
is making decisions about what to do.
And I know the index providers always say
they're just holding up a mirror
to the market.
But, you know,
some of that seems very subjective to me.
Like whether or not you're going to add
Chinese bonds into a debt index and things
like that, are we just outsourcing
our investment decisions to the indexes.
To a large degree?
Yeah.
I mean, I, I talk about how
there is no such thing as passive
investing a lot, more than I should,
because it annoys a lot of people.
But there's a lot of people
who demonize passive investing.
I think, for kind of phony reasons.
And a big part of that is this fact
that, you know, the reason I talk about
and try to quantify the global
financial asset portfolio is because
I was trying to create a benchmark for
if we were going to define something
as passive as,
you know, truly passive to me is you're
buying the full market portfolio.
You're not deviating at all.
You're not making
any active decisions at all.
And so when you quantify the gap,
you can actually create a benchmark there
where you understand, okay, well,
this is the only if you were truly
fully 100% passive,
this is the only thing you would own.
And the funny thing is
nobody can buy this thing and nobody
does buy this thing,
because even at a stock bond, weighting
the stock versus bond weighting right now
is something like 4555.
So you're
you're inherently underweight stock.
So it's not even that close
to even like the 6040 portfolio.
And so everybody deviates from this.
And I write about how that's totally fine.
There's nothing wrong with deviating
and there's nothing wrong
with being a little bit active.
And so even from the indexing perspective,
though, like, I laugh at like the,
you know,
the way the S&P 500 is constructed, it's,
it's a committee of people
that are constantly picking and choosing
which firms to introduce.
And it's very methodical.
It's, you know, very data dependent.
So it's a very systematic sort of process.
But at the end of the day,
they're choosing the 500 companies that
go into that index in the first place.
And so, you know,
in the context of the global equity
market, it's even more interesting
because they're excluding
thousands of other entities
just, you know, by their own volition.
So everyone's active.
And, you know,
there's very smart ways to be active.
And there's a very stupid ways
to be active.
And I would say that,
you know, a lot of the things,
the most sort of disconcerting thing
that I see going on these days is that
I see the issuance of a lot of strategies,
and especially with the rise of crypto,
there's a lot of things going on that
I would describe as stupid active, where
people are more having like a gambling
mentality approaching
all of this than, than anything else.
If we had like another hour, actually,
I would love to just pick your brain
about the investment advisory business,
like less than the portfolio construction
per se, and just how this world works,
because I have so many questions
about that.
But have one.
And, you know, we've seen you
we run into every once in a while down
at the Futureproof conference in,
Southern California and,
you know, or there's a lot of advisors
and then there's a lot of vendors
and they're selling various products.
And one of the things that we know
that they're trying
to get people excited
about owning private assets or,
you know, various alternatives, etc.,
non vanilla
things in your perspective
for most clients that you see,
is there like a compelling reason
for some of these novel products
or for some of them to include like, yeah,
private credit, private assets, private,
whatever it is, do these solve problems
for the portfolio manager,
for the investment
advisor that the existing publicly,
liquid assets don't provide? Yeah.
2022 messed a lot of people up
because when stocks and bonds
become highly correlated
and you own that 6040 portfolio that,
you know, the bonds go down 15% or
whatever, and the stocks also go down 25%.
Well, then you look at your portfolio
at the end of the year
and you say, well, I don't own
I don't I'm not actually diversified.
If you were that retiree
that you mentioned, Tracy,
that is retiring that year,
you feel like you made a bad decision,
even though the 6040 portfolio, for
the most part, is a pretty good portfolio.
And so there's this
there is an increasingly compelling
argument in that context
for things like alternatives.
I, I mean, me personally,
I tend to just sort of default
towards simple is better
because I think that this whole process
can get so complex so quickly
that the little things you can do
to create organization and structure,
to simplify it as best as possible,
is going to result in a better process,
a better outcome in the long run.
So, you know, little things like,
I mean, God, I woke up ten years ago
and I looked at me and my wife's
financial accounts and I was like,
oh my God, we've got I've got a mirror,
an old Merrill Lynch for okay.
And I've got,
you've got old fidelity for one case and
you've got your bank account over there.
I have a bank account over here.
We've got three brokerage accounts
that Charles Schwab and you know,
different custodians, TD Ameritrade
or whatever it might be.
And I was like,
this is I can't manage all this.
I've actually forgotten the password
to some of these accounts or something.
And so collapsing all this down
and consolidating it and simplifying it
and trying to own, you know,
something that is very, very simple.
I one of the portfolios I talk about is
the bogle had three fund
portfolio in the book.
And I think one of the reasons
that so many people love that
and those the followers of that portfolio
are they're very,
almost militant about it.
And I think in part
because it is so simple that it is it's
just beautifully sort of elegant
in its simplicity and
but then you could get into debates about
is it too simple?
What is it?
The Bogle had three.
It's basically a bond aggregate.
And then and you can mix this up,
you know, in different slices
based on your risk profile.
But it's three funds. It's a domestic
equity fund a foreign equity fund.
And the bond aggregate.
And these investors will buy this
and they'll buy it for, you know, costs
like three basis points
or something in total. Yeah.
And so it follows like all the sort
of like Taylor Laramore was the founder
of it.
And Taylor was he's someone
I interviewed in the book and he's not
he wasn't really
in the financial advisory business.
But what he
he became
great friends with Bogle over the years
because he was just emailing with him.
He had a actually a funny backstory
where he, he comes back from World War two
and, he fought in the battle of the bulge
and jumped out of airplanes
and had all these cool stories about it.
But he, he comes back
and I guess he married like
the hottest woman in Miami or something.
And she was a model, and she's making
crazy, crazy amounts of money modeling.
And so he comes into all this money
and he doesn't know what to do with it,
and he hires a financial advisor
who hoses him and he starts
emailing John Bogle.
And Bogle, then starts telling him, like,
now you should be doing this,
this and this.
They become great, great friends.
Bogle ultimately crowns him
the king of the Bogle heads later in life.
And so he's kind of like the most famous
of all the Bogle heads now.
And but he distilled all of Vogel's
thought processes down into, like,
the simplest of all possible portfolios,
which is this famous three fund portfolio.
But it's arguably I,
I am finally critical of it because I,
I would say that to some degree,
there is such a thing as too simple
also where, for instance, like if you own
the three fund portfolio in 2022,
you probably wish you owned
some of the T-bill and chill portfolio,
or maybe you wish you owned,
you know, something
completely uncorrelated,
like the trend following portfolio
or something, you know,
that added a little bit of diversification
that kept you, you know,
helped you sort of stay
the course, as Bogle would say.
I really enjoyed the Warren Buffett
portfolio chapter, in part because it
demonstrates how people get decision
paralysis around all of this.
So even if you're trying to replicate
Warren Buffett's investment style,
you come up with three different ways
to do it, right?
So it just seems like
an infinite way to invest.
But the thing I want to ask you is you
also say that you wrote to Warren Buffett
and you actually got a response.
Yeah. What did he say?
This was
like before you wrote the book early in.
You're.
Oh, this is in my early 20s, when, I was
too poor to own a share of Berkshire.
So in order to go to the shareholder
meeting, you had to be a shareholder.
And I was too poor to own
a share of Berkshire back then.
So I.
I wrote him a letter and I, I said, hey,
could I come to the conference
even though I'm this poor schmuck
who can't even afford to buy your shares?
And I get a typewritten letter,
and it comes in like,
you know, probably
a five by six little piece of paper,
and it's typewritten
and it was from his assistant
on behalf of him,
but he wrote and invited me and I.
Oh, that's really cool.
It was awesome.
I had, a family event.
I ended up not going home,
which was. Have you ever been?
I've never been. Oh, so terrible decision.
But I, I went once,
and it was a fantastic experience.
Yeah, it was an cool. Yeah.
We should do an all thoughts from.
What he's done every time. Oh, yeah.
There's not going to be I mean yeah,
I guess they'll probably still be one
but it's not going to be the same. Yeah.
You guys should definitely
your dad. Lots with. Yeah. Yeah.
Can you introduce us
since you're corresponding member I can.
Do you have a typewriter?
Yeah. No, but I can find one.
Cullen Roche.
Really fun.
Thanks for coming
in. Studio. Congrats on the new book.
Let's stay in touch
and really enjoyed chatting with you.
Thanks for. Talking. It's great being.
Here. Absolutely.
That was a lot of fun.
Tracy, have you ever
have you heard of the fintech?
Startup Acorn?
Is that right?
Yeah, that's the one where you, like,
invest tiny bits of, like two years ago.
Loose change. Yeah.
Yeah.
So years ago, like,
I think I should probably
about ten years ago or nine years ago
or something like that. I read about it.
I was like,
I was like, curious how it worked.
So I like I signed up for an account
and it like takes this like small amount.
And also the app.
At least I'm not trying to like them.
It doesn't work very well and the
my password is always getting reset.
But every like year and a half
I remember that exists
that has outperformed
every other investment because it's like
the one thing that I've, like,
lost my password to and I can't access it.
Oh yeah. It's done great.
What did you actually invest
in? Like just.
It just.
Yeah.
It's like their growth, whatever
their growth fund is, it's not very much.
But God like that one thing. Right.
Just like the one I think about
and look at. Absolutely the least.
Because I could never open the app
and never once in a while I go
through the effort to reset the password.
It's done very well.
Well, this is like
this is the entire irony, right?
We talk about how there's no such thing
as passive investing.
But actually, if you just forgot
the password to your account and
never look at it, you tend to come close.
Yeah.
I really I just find this to be,
such a fascinating topic.
It does feel like, again,
it feels a little unsexy
because people are so interested
in the incredible amounts of money
that people have made in crypto
and I, etc.
but like the puzzle of,
like putting it all together and how you
find assets that make money across cycles
but are sufficiently uncorrelated, etc..
It's like an interesting
intellectual exercise. Right?
And you also have this entire industry
that's built
on the promise of outperformance.
Yeah, mostly.
And it feels really difficult to, resist,
I guess the mostly masculine
urge to outperform.
I liked your,
your question in the beginning
because it's something I've always
thought of, like about actually assessing
risk profile because, as Cullen put it,
everyone knows the right answer.
Oh, I'd buy and hold,
but I just I've always been skeptical
that anyone is a good judge
of their own risk profile.
So to hear him
talk about no, let's not talk about it.
Like let's math it out.
Let's talk about asset liabilities.
Let's talk about the predictability
of your income stream.
How that is a de facto fixed income asset
strikes me as a much more sort
of sound way to think about it
than just sort of psych yourself,
try to imagine how you're going to behave
the next time a pandemic.
Well, it also gets back to what
we were talking about in the intro, right?
Which is you can say,
I'm going to buy the dip if there's a 40%
drawdown, but chances are a 40% drawdown
is happening in a very bad economy.
You might lose your job and not have that
much to actually buy stuff with.
No, like March 2020,
it felt like the world was ending.
Who wants to buy
like the is calling you the word rational,
which is, I think, exactly right.
Like it feels rational all the time.
Everybody should be selling it this time.
It's very hard, very hard to actually
adhere to, sort of like simple rules.
Yeah. Shall we leave it
there? Let's leave it there.
