I
 think
 the
 expectation
 is
 that
 demand


and
 amount
 of
 tokens
 generated
 for
 the


enterprise
 will
 completely
 jump
 once
 you


are
 not
 bound
 anymore
 by
 humans
 asking


questions
 or
 reading
 them.
 As
 soon
 as


you
 have
 enough
 trust
 to
 have
 agents


running
 in
 the
 background,
 you're
 not


really
 limited
 by
 the
 number
 of
 tokens.


The
 term
 we
 use
 is
 control.
 The
 software


stack
 once
 deployed
 is
 in
 the
 hands
 of


our
 customers.
 They
 own
 the
 model


changes
 that
 we
 make.
 And
 I
 think
 it's


really
 important
 as
 a
 customer
 to


consider
 that
 your
 expertise
 and
 what


makes
 your
 company
 valuable
 stays
 yours.


>> Hi,
 I'm
 Matt
 Turk.
 Welcome
 back
 to
 the


Mad
 Podcast.
 Today
 we
 have
 a
 special


episode
 with
 Timote
 Lacro,
 the
 CTO
 and


co-founder
 of
 Mistrol,
 the
 company
 that


proved
 that
 you
 could
 build
 frontier


models
 with
 a
 fraction
 of
 the
 compute
 of


the
 US
 giants.
 But
 recently,
 Mistrol
 has


quietly
 evolved
 into
 a
 much
 more


ambitious
 full
 stack
 industrial
 power,


building
 not
 just
 the
 models,
 but
 the


platform,
 the
 deployment
 stack,
 and


their
 own
 massive
 supercomputing


clusters.
 We
 covered
 a
 lot
 of
 ground
 in


this
 one,
 the
 engineering
 behind
 Mistral


3,
 what
 sovereign
 AI
 actually
 means
 in


practice,
 and
 Tim's
 contrarian
 view
 on


why
 trust
 matters
 more
 than
 autonomy
 for


agents.
 If
 you're
 tired
 of
 the
 AI
 hype,


Tim
 is
 refreshingly
 nononsense.
 Please


enjoy
 this
 great
 conversation
 with


Timote
 LRA.


>> Hey
 Timote,
 welcome.


>> Hey.


>> So,
 as
 I
 was
 prepping
 for
 this,
 I
 was


struck
 by
 how
 much
 has
 been
 going
 on
 at


Mistrol
 over
 the
 last
 few
 months.
 I


think
 most
 people
 probably
 know
 Mistrol


as
 a
 provider
 of
 open-source
 models.
 It


seems
 that
 you
 guys
 evolved
 from
 an
 AI


lab
 to
 more
 of
 a
 full
 stack
 solution


focused
 on
 enterprise
 and
 sovereign


customers.
 So
 just
 to
 set
 it
 up,
 in
 the


last
 year
 you
 guys
 raised
 a€
 1.7
 billion


euros
 series
 C
 led
 by
 ASML
 at
 an
 11.7


billion
 post
 money
 valuation.
 you
 launch


a
 bunch
 of
 models
 which
 we're
 going
 to


talk
 about
 is
 the
 big
 vision
 behind
 all


of
 this
 that
 enterprises
 and
 sovereign


states
 are
 going
 to
 need
 their
 own
 AI


infrastructure
 and
 MR
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the


provider.


>> Uh
 so
 the
 big
 vision
 has
 been
 evolving


and
 as
 you
 stated
 we
 started
 uh
 as
 a


company
 that
 built
 models
 uh
 because


with
 Arthur
 and
 Guom
 this
 was
 what
 we


knew
 how
 to
 do
 at
 the
 start.
 The
 premise


on
 which
 we
 built
 Misual
 AI
 was


immediately
 solving
 for
 enterprise
 needs


uh
 and
 we
 started
 with
 open
 weights


model.
 After
 this
 uh
 and
 working
 with


enterprise
 we
 realized
 uh
 the
 need
 for


basically
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 stack.
 So
 we


built
 uh
 the
 serving
 platform
 because


infrastructure
 was
 needed.
 Um
 and
 then


all
 of
 the
 tooling
 around
 it
 uh
 was
 also


something
 that
 we
 saw
 was
 missing.
 more


than
 the
 tooling,
 it
 also
 requires
 a
 lot


of
 work
 and
 expertise
 still
 to
 get
 deep


into
 uh
 an
 enterprise
 workflows
 and


really
 help
 that
 transformation.
 And
 so


we
 built
 that
 uh
 FDE
 function
 and
 more


recently
 uh
 with
 MSR
 compute
 uh
 we're


going
 a
 bit
 lower
 uh
 in
 the
 stack
 as


well.
 So
 we've
 done
 all
 of
 this
 uh


because
 it
 was
 required
 for
 enterprise


success
 uh
 while
 still
 continuing
 uh
 on


our
 models
 journey.
 All
 of
 this
 stack
 uh


being
 modular
 is
 really
 important
 to
 us


as
 it
 gives
 full
 control
 to
 u
 enterprise


and
 our
 clients
 as
 to
 which
 part
 of
 the


stack
 they
 decide
 to
 uh
 own
 and
 control


which
 is
 maybe
 more
 involved
 or
 that


they
 decide
 to
 have
 serverless
 or


basically
 this
 modularity
 that
 we
 like.


>> All
 right.
 So
 let's
 take
 some
 of
 those


modular
 components
 uh
 in
 in
 order.
 Let's


start
 with
 mistral
 compute.
 So
 that
 was


a
 big
 announcement
 uh
 I
 guess
 in
 June
 of


2025
 putting
 a
 big
 partnership
 with


Nvidia
 to
 um
 help
 with
 this
 effort.
 Uh


what's
 the
 current
 status?
 Is
 that
 live


yet?
 Are
 you
 building
 it?
 You
 know,
 how


does
 one
 go
 about
 building
 data
 centers


or
 or
 leveraging
 data
 centers
 in
 Europe?


>> Maybe
 first
 to
 go
 into
 the
 reasons
 uh


why
 we
 decided
 to
 start
 building
 our
 own


data
 centers.
 uh
 we
 tried
 uh
 a
 lot
 of


different
 partners
 over
 the
 years
 and
 we


realized
 that
 our
 use
 uh
 of
 the
 AI


compute
 for
 large
 scale
 training
 was
 not


necessarily
 well
 understood
 by
 a
 lot
 of


providers
 and
 our
 uh
 need
 for
 stability


especially
 like
 when
 you
 run
 inference


on
 a
 few
 GPUs
 or
 when
 you
 run
 small


scale
 trainings
 on
 a
 hundreds
 of
 GPUs


margin
 for
 error
 is
 a
 lot
 larger
 than


when
 you
 run
 trainings
 on
 uh
 thousands


of
 GPUs
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 And
 so
 to


address
 this
 need
 for
 stability,
 we
 saw


a
 way
 for
 us
 to
 basically
 build
 our
 own


data
 centers
 and
 maintain
 it
 with
 our


understanding
 of
 what
 quality
 looks


like.
 And
 so
 that
 was
 why
 we
 uh
 launched


MRL
 compute.
 And
 when
 we
 decided
 to
 do


it,
 we
 also
 realized
 well
 maybe
 others


will
 benefit
 from
 it.
 We
 launched
 into


uh
 a
 bigger
 uh
 basically
 development


than
 what
 was
 previously
 intended.
 And


so
 this
 was
 announced
 in
 June
 as
 you


said
 since
 then
 the
 building
 of
 the


facility
 has
 progressed
 quite
 well.
 It's


in
 the
 south
 of
 Paris
 and
 we
 are
 right


now
 running
 through
 the
 stabilization
 uh


stabilization
 of
 the
 first
 trench.
 Uh
 so


it's
 uh
 quite
 a
 large
 data
 center
 so


delivery
 doesn't
 happen
 in
 one
 day.
 And


the
 first
 part
 of
 this
 data
 center
 is


something
 that
 we
 are
 working
 on
 as
 we


speak.
 We
 have
 a
 few
 jobs
 running
 and


we're
 fine-tuning
 uh
 basically
 all
 of


the
 last
 uh
 things
 uh
 to
 run
 at
 speed


and
 with
 the
 right
 stability.


>> Okay,
 great.
 And
 uh
 did
 I
 understand


correctly,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 for
 your


customers
 and
 your
 own
 needs
 uh
 around


training,
 but
 also
 you'll
 be
 providing


it
 as
 a
 service
 to
 others
 uh
 in
 in


Europe
 and
 beyond.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 So
 we
 will
 use
 part
 of


that
 capacity
 for
 ourselves
 as
 one
 of


our
 training
 clusters
 but
 we
 will
 also


provide
 a
 managed
 Kubernetes
 and
 managed


serum
 stack
 on
 top.


>> Okay.
 Any
 uh
 lessons
 learned
 so
 far?
 I


mean
 as
 you
 said
 you
 guys
 come
 from
 a


very
 deep
 background
 in
 in
 AI
 and
 AI


research.
 It's
 a
 whole
 different
 thing


to
 build
 a
 whole
 like
 data
 center


facility.
 How
 have
 you
 gone
 about
 it
 and


uh
 what
 are
 some
 things
 that
 that


surprised
 you
 and
 any
 lessons
 so
 far?
 As


most
 uh
 new
 experiences
 as
 a
 founder,
 I


relied
 on
 the
 knowledge
 of
 others.
 Uh


and
 so
 I
 was
 uh
 lucky
 to
 have
 a
 very
 a


few
 seasoned
 uh
 HPC
 experts
 uh
 and
 and
 a


lot
 of
 uh
 cloud
 software
 experts
 as
 well


to
 build
 that
 solution.
 For
 me


personally,
 and
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I


love
 about
 uh
 my
 position
 at
 Mistral
 is


that
 I
 get
 to
 uh
 discover
 so
 many
 new


things
 uh
 and
 so
 many
 new
 problems
 I


hadn't
 thought
 possible.
 having
 to
 learn


to
 like
 all
 of
 the
 different
 parts
 of


building
 a
 data
 center,
 all
 of
 the


different
 trades
 that
 you
 have
 to


coordinate,
 uh
 all
 of
 the
 potential
 um


synchronization
 uh
 between
 all
 of
 the


different
 trades.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 a
 huge


building.
 It
 involves
 hundreds
 of
 people


working
 on
 it.
 You
 have
 this
 then
 when


you
 uh
 stand
 up
 the
 thing,
 uh
 you
 have


to
 question
 what
 works.
 You
 have
 to


filter
 through
 the
 blades
 that
 are


faulty.
 It's
 just
 an
 entire
 new
 area
 of


work
 where
 I
 get
 to
 see
 um
 experts
 in


their
 field
 go
 through
 things
 and
 try
 to


explain
 to
 me
 what
 their
 daily
 work
 is.


It's
 always
 fascinating
 to
 see
 um
 an


expert
 in
 his
 field
 like
 do
 something


that
 you
 don't
 know
 how
 to
 do.
 I
 think


the
 logistics
 of
 it
 uh
 and
 the
 timelines


are
 also
 quite
 different
 from
 what
 I'm


usually
 um
 dealing
 with
 in
 software
 and


research.
 for
 new
 capacity
 to
 uh
 be


built,
 you
 have
 to
 plan
 around
 uh
 having


energy
 available,
 you
 have
 to
 plan
 for


the
 uh
 space
 to
 be
 available
 and
 on


time.
 And
 so
 it's
 a
 lot
 more
 long-term


planning
 than
 a
 few
 software
 features.


>> How
 do
 you
 guys
 go
 about
 power
 since
 you


mentioned
 energy?


>> In
 what
 we've
 been
 doing
 in
 Europe
 so


far
 hasn't
 been
 a
 huge
 blocker,
 although


uh
 there
 is
 constraint.
 Uh
 I
 think
 the


grid
 in
 various
 parts
 of
 Europe
 is
 not


uh
 necessarily
 easily
 extensible.
 I
 know


it's
 uh
 an
 issue
 in
 in
 France.
 A
 lot
 of


the
 sites
 are
 uh
 contended.
 Um
 so
 we


we'll
 see
 how
 it
 all
 develops.
 We
 are


lucky
 in
 Europe
 to
 have
 uh
 very
 uh
 clean


and
 affordable
 energy
 uh
 either
 with
 uh


green
 energy
 in
 the
 Nordics
 and
 nuclear


in
 France.
 So
 it's
 it's
 been
 relatively


okay
 for
 us
 today.
 as
 you
 describe
 this


uh
 what
 comes
 to
 mind
 is
 the
 gigantic


amounts
 of
 money
 that
 are
 being
 invested


in
 the
 US
 around
 uh
 data
 centers.
 How
 do


you
 guys
 uh
 go
 about
 that
 from
 a


financing
 standpoint
 and
 and
 perhaps


even
 more
 taking
 a
 step
 back
 if
 you


think
 about
 the
 race
 between
 the
 big
 AI


labs
 globally
 whether
 that's
 you
 know


the
 opensis
 and
 anthropic
 of
 the
 world


and
 and
 XAI
 uh
 it
 seems
 that
 all
 of
 them


are
 affiliated
 with
 a
 gigantic
 pocket
 of


money
 somewhere
 obviously
 there's
 Gemini


and
 Google
 to
 add
 to
 the
 list
 and
 and


Meta
 I'm
 just
 curious
 like
 how
 where
 do


you
 guys
 stand
 on
 on
 that
 you
 have
 a


bunch
 of
 partnerships
 with
 um
 SAP
 and


Nvidia
 but
 there
 is
 you
 don't
 have
 one


of
 those
 gigantic
 companies
 on
 your
 cap


table.
 So
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 think


about
 uh
 competing
 in
 that
 general


context?
 So
 with
 those
 uh
 companies,
 so


the
 hypers
 scalers,
 it's
 um
 there
 are


two
 parts
 to
 the
 game
 and
 we've
 played


the
 partnership
 uh
 part
 quite
 well
 with


them
 and
 we're
 integrated
 within


Google's
 Verex
 uh
 Amazon
 Bedrock
 and
 uh


Asia
 Studio
 and
 that
 is
 uh
 the
 choice


that
 we've
 made
 in
 term
 of
 having
 access


to
 uh
 gigantic
 pockets
 of
 monies.
 We've


been
 focused
 on
 efficiency
 from
 the


start.
 Uh
 and
 I
 think
 we've
 done
 quite


well
 at
 building
 uh
 models
 that
 are
 uh


competitive
 with
 the
 uh
 investments
 that


we've
 uh
 put
 in.
 For
 us,
 it's
 important


to
 build
 uh
 the
 company
 as
 efficiently


as
 we
 can.
 uh
 and
 I
 deeply
 believe
 that


with
 the
 capabilities
 that
 we
 have
 today


in
 the
 models
 there
 is
 so
 much
 to
 be


unlocked
 uh
 in
 enterprise
 that
 um
 I
 I


don't
 think
 my
 main
 focus
 uh
 today
 would


be
 into
 going
 into
 the
 gigawatts
 of


power
 we
 still
 need
 to
 build
 uh
 so
 much


with
 our
 clients
 and
 unlock
 so
 much


values
 with
 theap
 capacities
 that
 we


have


>> all
 right
 so
 let's
 go
 into
 uh
 the


enterprise
 reality
 of
 all
 of
 this
 um
 so


if
 I'm
 an
 enterprise
 or
 if
 I'm
 a


sovereign
 and
 I
 want
 to
 deploy
 a
 MR


open-source
 model
 what
 is
 it
 that
 I
 do


these
 days
 with
 everything
 that
 you
 that


you've
 built
 the
 way
 we
 work
 with
 um


enterprise
 I
 mean
 as
 you
 mentioned
 like


we
 have
 a
 few
 of
 our
 models
 that
 are


open
 source
 and
 Apache
 and
 all
 of
 our


clients
 are
 welcome
 to
 use
 them
 uh
 as


they
 need
 what
 we
 have
 seen
 in
 terms
 of


success
 is
 that
 given
 the
 current
 stack


It
 still
 requires
 um
 a
 lot
 of
 expertise


uh
 to
 manage
 to
 come
 to
 um
 actual
 value


and
 um
 and
 things
 that
 go
 to
 production.


Basically
 the
 way
 we
 interact
 is
 that
 we


usually
 stand
 up
 our
 um
 Misual
 AI
 studio


which
 is
 our
 platform
 and
 we
 can
 deploy


uh
 all
 of
 our
 stack
 on
 the
 client's


choice
 uh
 of
 deployment
 methods.
 So
 it


can
 be
 on
 prem
 uh
 it
 can
 be
 on
 their
 VPC


it
 can
 be
 on
 uh
 in
 several
 places.
 The


reason
 we
 do
 this
 is
 that
 it
 lets
 uh


clients
 build
 where
 their
 data
 is
 uh
 and


without
 having
 to
 shuffle
 things
 around


which
 as
 I've
 learned
 as
 a
 CTO
 is


something
 that
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 ever


because
 it
 asks
 it
 raises
 a
 lot
 of


questions
 uh
 and
 it's
 uh
 quite
 a


stressful
 thing
 to
 do.
 So
 once
 this
 is


deployed
 uh
 we
 then
 uh
 work
 with
 the


business
 units
 to
 understand
 where
 their


pain
 points
 are.
 Sometimes
 it's


knowledge
 management
 and
 I
 think
 it's


the
 most
 well-known
 uh
 use
 case
 from
 the


output
 from
 the
 outside
 of
 the


enterprise
 world
 but
 it's
 also
 around
 um


automating
 core
 workflows
 for
 the


enterprise.
 Um
 it's
 you
 know
 some


tooling
 that
 you
 wouldn't
 expect
 where


one
 thing
 that
 we've
 done
 is
 around
 code


modernization
 uh
 where
 you
 you
 turn
 a


bunch
 of
 Excel
 sheets
 into
 an
 actual


like
 Python
 app.
 Uh
 and
 if
 you
 have
 many


many
 of
 those
 sheets
 then
 potentially


you
 want
 to
 use
 AI
 for
 this.
 So
 once
 the


infrastructure
 is
 built
 then
 we


basically
 look
 for
 what's
 the
 most


valuable
 to
 the
 customer
 and
 we
 start


acrewing
 value
 uh
 inside
 a
 stack
 of
 AI


assets
 that
 then
 accelerates
 all
 of
 the


other
 developments
 with
 that
 customer


>> and
 is
 part
 of
 the
 idea
 is
 that
 you
 do


actual
 model
 work
 at
 the
 customer
 and


for
 the
 customers
 in
 particular


fine-tuning.


>> Yes,
 we
 we
 customize
 in
 various
 ways.
 Uh


so
 we
 have
 done
 continued
 pre-training


and
 this
 is
 most
 useful
 when
 you
 want
 to


uh
 change
 the
 capabilities
 of
 a
 model
 uh


more
 deeply.
 So
 we've
 done
 this
 to


sometimes
 change
 uh
 the
 mix
 of
 languages


in
 a
 model
 to
 get
 something
 that's
 a
 lot


better
 at
 thou
 east
 Asian
 uh
 languages


for
 example
 or
 you
 could
 have
 require


this
 if
 your
 internal
 data
 uh
 which


doesn't
 happen
 on
 the
 public
 web
 is


something
 that's
 so
 new
 uh
 that
 you
 need


a
 large
 amount
 of
 to
 of
 tokens
 uh
 to
 get


a
 model
 that
 understands
 it
 and
 becomes


fluent
 with
 it.
 So
 we
 do
 uh
 these
 kinds


of
 continued
 pre-training
 fine-tuning.


We
 also
 um
 like
 and
 this
 is
 more
 for
 an


efficiency
 reason.
 When
 you
 get
 to


smaller
 models,
 you
 have
 to
 make


trade-offs.
 Uh
 the
 models
 won't
 be
 as


good
 in
 their
 knowledge
 of
 the
 world.


And
 so
 when
 you
 lose
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 things,


you
 have
 to
 focus
 on
 what
 you
 really


care
 about.
 And
 so
 this
 is
 typically


important
 if
 you
 want
 really
 uh
 fast,


really
 cheap
 uh
 models
 that
 will
 be


really
 good
 at
 a
 specific
 task.
 It's


also
 useful
 if
 you
 want
 models
 that
 run


on
 the
 edge
 uh
 that
 get
 very
 very
 tiny.


Uh
 and
 so
 for
 all
 of
 these
 fine-tuning


is
 a
 tool
 of
 choice.
 Another
 uh
 reason


to
 do
 fine-tuning.
 It
 can
 be
 to
 adapt
 to


uh
 data
 that's
 not
 necessarily
 massive


but
 that's
 also
 not
 available
 on
 the


web.
 So
 typically
 in
 coding
 uh
 what


happens
 is
 that
 you
 will
 have
 massive


code
 bases
 sometimes
 acrewed
 over


decades
 uh
 that
 the
 model
 will
 need
 to


be
 able
 to
 uh
 work
 with
 in
 terms
 of
 uh


having
 like
 vibe
 uh
 deployed
 on
 it


typically
 and
 so
 being
 able
 to
 come
 in


not
 move
 the
 code
 base
 and
 uh
 learn
 an


actual
 coding
 agent
 for
 that
 codebase
 is


really
 powerful
 as
 well.


>> And
 who
 does
 the
 all
 of
 this
 you
 have


evolved
 towards
 an
 FDA
 model.
 So
 we
 have


indeed
 a
 large
 uh
 FD
 section.
 It's
 it's


a
 mix
 of
 software
 and
 uh
 FDEEs
 and
 we


split
 our
 FDES
 into
 what
 we
 called
 um
 AI


engineers
 and
 applied
 scientists.
 Um
 and


so
 uh
 applied
 scientists
 will
 tend
 to


use
 the
 tools
 that
 we've
 just
 uh
 uh


talked
 about.
 So
 fine-tuning,
 continued


pre-training
 and
 the
 likes
 where
 AI


engineers
 will
 focus
 more
 on
 adaptation


to
 the
 enterprise
 environment
 and


figuring
 out
 what
 workflows
 to
 automate


and
 all
 of
 this.
 They
 work
 with
 the


customers
 to
 make
 sure
 uh
 that
 the
 use


cases
 are
 indeed
 providing
 values
 and


going
 to
 production.
 But
 it's
 also
 a


fantastic
 way
 for
 us
 to
 understand
 what


matters
 in
 an
 enterprise
 context
 and
 be


faster
 at
 building
 the
 right
 platform.


And
 uh
 again
 those
 customers
 are
 the


kind
 of
 customer
 for
 whom
 customization


and
 privacy
 is
 essential.
 Uh
 how
 do
 you


how
 do
 you
 position
 again
 open
 of
 the


world
 that
 are
 going
 very
 hard
 at
 the


enterprise?
 Is
 that
 data
 sovereignty?
 Is


that
 customization?


>> The
 term
 we
 use
 is
 control.
 The
 value


that
 we
 see
 is
 both
 in
 our
 expertise
 and


the
 software
 stack
 that
 we
 provide.
 The


software
 stack
 once
 deployed
 uh
 is
 in


the
 hands
 of
 our
 customers
 and
 they
 can


change
 it,
 they
 can
 add
 to
 it.
 They
 own


model
 changes
 that
 we
 make
 and
 I
 think


it's
 really
 important
 as
 a
 customer
 to


consider
 that
 your
 expertise
 and
 what


makes
 your
 company
 valuable
 stays
 yours.


And
 so
 in
 working
 with
 us
 and
 building


uh
 because
 it
 takes
 effort
 uh
 to
 build


an
 AI
 advantage
 uh
 today
 and
 so
 having


this
 effort
 built
 into
 uh
 something
 that


you
 own
 is
 I
 think
 a
 choice
 that
 makes


sense.


>> Let's
 talk
 about
 uh
 agents
 uh
 obviously


part
 of
 the
 overall
 effort
 at
 Mistrol.


How
 does
 that
 work?
 Uh
 how
 do
 you
 uh


build
 an
 agent
 and
 uh
 what
 key
 use
 cases


have
 you
 seen
 so
 far?
 Personally,
 I


think
 I've
 moved
 uh
 from
 agents
 to
 uh


workflows,
 which
 is
 I
 guess
 an


abstraction
 uh
 on
 top.
 Um
 so
 agents
 are


I
 think
 the
 building
 blocks
 uh
 where
 you


have
 a
 given
 expected
 input,
 a
 set
 of


tools
 and
 you
 are
 trying
 to
 reach
 a
 uh


set
 of
 uh
 you
 have
 a
 goal
 that
 you
 want


to
 reach.
 The
 set
 of
 inputs
 uh
 that


we've
 enabled
 are
 um
 images,
 text
 uh
 and


audio.
 When
 you
 build
 an
 agent,
 to
 me


it's
 really
 important
 that
 you
 build
 it


on
 a
 focused
 uh
 task
 with
 a
 data
 set


that
 you
 understand
 and
 that
 you
 can


iterate
 on
 and
 that
 you
 can
 improve.


What
 we
 see
 in
 enterprise
 is
 rarely


things
 that
 are
 solved
 with
 agents


because
 that's
 not
 necessarily
 where
 you


would
 expect
 uh
 an
 FDE
 to
 be
 most


useful.
 Those
 ideally
 would
 be
 built
 uh


on
 our
 platform
 by
 the
 customers


directly.
 Where
 there
 is
 more
 values


value
 is
 in
 uh
 more
 complex
 workflows


where
 you
 will
 have
 several
 uh
 agents


interact
 through
 a
 workflow
 to
 automate


something
 slightly
 more
 complex.
 And
 so


that's
 what
 we've
 been
 focusing
 on.
 What


would
 be
 an
 example?


>> An
 example
 is
 something
 that
 we've
 built


uh
 with
 the
 shipping
 company
 CMACGM


where
 we've
 automated
 the
 uh
 container


release
 process.
 Uh
 and
 so
 it's
 um
 a
 use


case
 where
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 familiar


you
 are
 with
 shipping.
 I
 wasn't
 at


first.
 Uh
 but
 a
 container
 reaches
 a
 port


and
 you
 have
 to
 uh
 harbor
 uh
 probably
 in


English.
 some
 decision
 has
 to
 be
 made


that
 this
 uh
 container
 is
 ready
 for


release
 to
 the
 uh
 next
 person
 on
 on
 the


line
 to
 handle
 this
 container
 and
 so


there
 are
 lots
 of
 uh
 checks
 uh
 that
 need


to
 be
 um
 run
 and
 data
 to
 be
 accessed
 in


the
 back
 end
 uh
 before
 that
 decision
 is


made.
 So
 as
 you
 can
 imagine,
 some
 of


those
 containers
 are
 extremely
 valuable


and
 you
 can't
 really
 afford
 a
 mistake.


And
 so
 what
 we've
 done
 in
 this
 case
 is


an
 application
 that's
 integrated
 into
 um


how
 these
 uh
 harbor
 worker
 work
 and
 it


automates
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 manual
 work
 that


they
 did
 to
 check
 the
 data
 and
 they
 make


the
 final
 decision
 uh
 given
 all
 of
 the


evidence.


>> Okay,
 this
 is
 super
 interesting.


Obviously
 the
 the
 key
 question
 about


agents
 these
 days
 especially
 when
 they


are
 combined
 into
 workflows
 is
 the


question
 of
 uh
 autonomy.
 How
 do
 you
 guys


think
 about
 it?
 How
 autonomous
 are
 those


agents
 uh
 in
 in
 your
 deployments?


>> I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 the
 way
 I
 think


about
 it.
 To
 me
 the


better
 question
 usually
 is
 how
 much
 you


trust
 uh
 the
 agents
 and
 there
 are
 a
 few


dimensions
 uh
 around
 this.
 What
 worries


me
 when
 building
 those
 kind
 of
 workflows


is
 that
 typically
 if
 you
 want
 the
 value


to
 acrue
 and
 if
 you
 want
 to
 build
 faster


and
 faster
 the
 more
 workflows
 that
 you


build,
 what
 you
 will
 want
 to
 do
 is
 uh


reuse
 assets
 and
 make
 them
 reusable
 by


others.
 Uh
 as
 soon
 as
 you
 do
 this
 with


agents,
 you
 then
 start
 to
 ask
 the


question,
 well
 this
 agent
 has
 access
 to


some
 data
 that
 is
 privileged
 uh
 but


maybe
 this
 other
 agent
 uh
 is
 publishing


it
 to
 something
 that's
 public.
 You
 might


have
 governance
 concerns
 where
 uh
 some


agent
 is
 acting
 on
 something
 very


critical
 and
 you
 don't
 know
 necessarily


that
 the
 data
 that
 it
 got
 uh
 has
 been


approved
 or
 something
 like
 this.
 It's


really
 a
 new
 way
 to
 develop
 where
 uh
 the


parts
 of
 your
 workflows
 have
 to
 be


trusted.
 Each
 of
 them
 to
 be
 trusted


requires
 uh
 quite
 a
 lot
 of
 tooling
 uh


and
 quite
 a
 lot
 of
 observability
 uh
 to


get
 confidence
 and
 to
 basically
 enable


this
 at
 scale
 in
 an
 enterprise.
 So
 the


question
 that
 you're
 asking
 about


autonomy
 to
 me
 this
 is
 something
 that
 I


see
 happening
 when
 I
 vibe
 code.
 Sure


like
 longer
 running
 tasks
 and
 making
 and


improving
 on
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be


critical
 and
 we're
 uh
 working
 on
 it


daily.
 But
 today,
 the
 problems
 that


we're
 solving
 on
 the
 software
 side
 of


things
 are
 really
 about
 how
 you
 trust


what
 you've
 built
 and
 how
 you
 improve


it.
 Uh,
 and
 how
 you
 allow
 an
 entire


company
 to
 build
 on
 it
 with
 confidence.


>> Maybe
 describe
 some
 of
 the
 things
 that


you
 guys
 have
 built
 in
 studio
 around


governance
 as
 you
 mentioned
 and


trackability
 and
 uh
 registry
 all
 the


things.
 What
 what
 are
 the
 key
 components


of
 an
 a
 modern
 agent
 suite?
 So
 workflows


as
 I
 mentioned
 is
 something
 that
 uh


we've
 worked
 a
 lot
 on
 uh
 with
 our


customers
 and
 it's
 not
 GA
 yet.
 Uh
 so


look
 out
 for
 this
 uh
 sometimes
 in
 the


future
 but
 it's
 also
 one
 of
 the
 benefits


uh
 of
 working
 with
 enterprise
 we
 can
 um


have
 a
 lot
 of
 design
 partners
 and
 once


we're
 confident
 uh
 with
 the
 solution
 uh


we
 we
 make
 it
 G.
 So
 a
 workflow
 solution


is
 critical.
 Workflows
 are
 built
 on


various
 uh
 model
 capabilities.
 So
 u


vision,
 audio
 and
 text
 and
 reasoning.
 It


is
 important
 to
 uh
 have
 a
 registry
 of
 uh


connectors
 and
 MCPS.
 Uh
 and
 so
 for
 this


we
 have
 uh
 our
 connections.
 The


observability
 is
 an
 area
 where
 we're


still
 working
 on.
 Um
 it's
 important
 for


me
 to
 be
 able
 to
 iterate
 and
 really


define
 uh
 precisely
 what
 an
 agent
 does


and
 control
 each
 of
 its
 goal
 uh
 and
 see


how
 it's
 progressing
 um
 being
 able
 to


maintain
 evaluations
 and
 uh
 build
 build


on
 them.
 What
 is
 um
 difficult
 in
 this


entire
 sea
 of
 complexity
 is
 that
 you


also
 have
 to
 maintain
 proper
 versioning


and
 tagging
 and
 think
 about
 how
 you're


going
 to
 deploy
 and
 improve
 uh
 upon
 what


you've
 built.
 So
 let's
 say
 you've
 built


a
 kickass
 workflow
 based
 on
 a
 lot
 of


agents
 and
 models
 that
 Mrol
 has
 released


in
 the
 past.
 Then
 a
 few
 months
 pass
 and


there
 are
 new
 sets
 of
 models
 that
 are


out.
 Maybe
 you
 can
 simplify
 that


workflow.
 Maybe
 the
 next
 uh
 mist
 4
 is


good
 enough
 that
 you
 can
 factor
 out
 a


few
 agents.
 Basically,
 what
 you
 need
 to


be
 able
 to
 do
 is
 create
 a
 new
 agent,
 run


it
 on
 the
 same
 set
 of
 inputs
 and
 outputs


and
 control
 that
 you
 haven't
 broken


anything
 and
 then
 deploy
 it
 in
 the
 wild.


All
 of
 this
 software
 uh
 suite
 basically


which
 has
 been
 built
 for
 software


development
 over
 years
 I
 feel
 it
 isn't


there
 yet
 uh
 in
 the
 AI
 world
 and
 that's


what
 we're
 building


>> as
 I'm
 sure
 you've
 seen
 there
 was
 uh
 for


the
 last
 few
 weeks
 in
 startup
 and


venture
 circles
 there's
 been
 this
 whole


idea
 of
 the
 context
 graph
 as
 an


infrastructure
 that
 made
 the
 rounds.
 Is


that
 something
 that
 you
 think
 about
 or
 a


layer
 that
 would
 basically
 uh
 enable
 one


to
 know
 how
 the
 agents
 made
 a
 decision


and
 how
 those
 decision
 relate
 to
 one


another?


>> I've
 seen
 this
 indeed
 and
 I
 think
 there


are
 two
 uh
 levels
 to
 that
 discussion.


the
 part
 that
 you
 mentioned
 at
 the
 end


where
 uh
 it's
 interesting
 to
 know
 how
 an


agent
 came
 to
 so
 in
 that
 discussion
 when


when
 we
 talk
 about
 understanding
 how
 an


agent
 came
 to
 a
 decision
 or
 an
 action


the
 game
 is
 really
 to
 understand
 how
 a


human
 uh
 agent
 really
 made
 this


decision.
 It's
 understanding
 how
 an


enterprise
 does
 what
 it
 does
 and
 it's


certainly
 interesting.
 uh
 what
 keeps
 me


up
 at
 night
 and
 what
 I
 really
 want
 to


solve
 first
 is
 just
 the
 basic
 idea
 of


gathering
 a
 workable
 enterprise
 context.


Right
 now
 uh
 with
 uh
 any
 model
 uh
 and


with
 a
 lot
 of
 effort
 you
 will
 be
 able
 to


get
 some
 connections
 to
 tools
 and
 you


will
 ask
 a
 questions
 and
 your
 agent
 will


do
 a
 bunch
 of
 things.
 it
 will
 realize


that
 oh
 by
 doing
 five
 API
 calls
 and


three
 joins
 I
 can
 probably
 get
 uh
 what


Timothy
 asked
 immediately
 what
 should


happen
 is
 that
 um
 all
 of
 that
 uh


discovery
 and
 all
 of
 that
 intelligence


should
 be
 stored
 somewhere
 to
 be
 reused.


It's
 not
 really
 how
 things
 happen.
 It's


just
 basic
 knowledge
 uh
 about
 what
 the


infrastructure
 of
 the
 company
 is.
 So


knowing
 where
 the
 tables
 are,
 what
 they


contain,
 how
 they're
 joined.
 So
 all
 of


this
 um
 is
 compute
 that
 should
 be


amortized
 basically
 and
 to
 me
 it's


really
 the
 entire
 game
 with
 the
 context


engine
 as
 we
 call
 it
 internally
 is
 to
 um


be
 in
 a
 setup
 where
 over
 time
 knowledge


of
 the
 company
 and
 the
 context
 that's


available
 to
 the
 agent
 uh
 acrru
 and
 is


maintained.
 The
 second
 order
 thing
 of
 oh


how
 was
 that
 decision
 reached?
 Sure.
 Uh


it's
 going
 to
 be
 super
 interesting
 and


it's
 important,
 but
 right
 now
 I
 feel


we're
 not
 even
 in
 a
 place
 where
 it's


easy
 for
 an
 enterprise
 to
 have
 any


worker
 uh
 in
 it
 be
 able
 to
 build
 an


agent
 that
 has
 access
 to
 the
 right


context.
 For
 this
 to
 happen,
 you
 have


huge
 uh
 data
 privacy
 concern.
 If
 you


want
 this
 to
 be
 efficient,
 you
 need
 to


give
 access
 to
 uh
 the
 agent
 system
 to


the
 entire
 uh
 data
 of
 your
 enterprise.


And
 there
 is
 going
 to
 be
 arbbacks


everywhere
 and
 you
 need
 to
 make
 this


safe.


>> Speaking
 of
 which,
 what
 what's
 current


reality
 of
 enterprise
 deployments
 of
 of


generative
 AI
 from
 your
 perspective?


just
 listening
 to
 like
 some
 of
 the


concern
 like
 since
 like
 we
 very
 early


>> to
 me
 we
 are
 still
 in
 the
 building
 phase


and
 I
 think
 it's
 kind
 of
 the
 frustrating


thing
 for
 enterprise
 is
 that
 when
 you


come
 to
 um
 a
 chat
 assistant
 you
 feel


that
 it's
 it's
 magic
 and
 it's
 all
 going


to
 work
 but
 as
 most
 things
 that
 have


value
 in
 life
 there
 is
 still
 work
 to
 be


done
 uh
 to
 get
 to
 them
 and
 so
 most
 of


the
 enterprise
 value
 of
 AI
 will
 happen


once
 you've
 gone
 through
 that
 first


building
 phase
 of
 just
 setting
 up
 all
 of


the
 machinery.
 You've
 got
 to
 set
 up
 all


of
 the
 connections.
 You've
 got
 to
 make


all
 of
 that
 data
 available.
 And
 the


reality
 is
 even
 despite
 a
 lot
 of
 work


recently
 to
 make
 u
 data
 more
 available


in
 enterprise,
 it's
 still
 not
 easily


available
 in
 the
 format
 and
 at
 the
 scale


that
 we
 need
 uh
 for
 the
 true
 ROI
 of
 AI


to
 to
 happen.
 And
 so
 when
 we
 come
 in
 uh


there
 is
 still
 that
 phase
 of
 work
 that


is
 uh
 just
 work
 uh
 to
 connect
 everything


and
 then
 be
 able
 to
 build
 on
 it.


>> So
 do
 you
 think
 we
 are
 years
 away
 from


generi
 actually
 being
 deployed
 in
 the


enterprise?
 not
 years
 uh
 I
 think
 years


singular
 uh
 it's
 uh
 also
 to
 be
 fair
 to


us
 we've
 started
 working
 I
 mean
 the


company
 started
 two
 years
 ago
 and
 so


most
 of
 our
 uh


>> it's
 a
 good
 reminder
 right
 it's
 a
 good


reminder
 that
 like
 you
 guys
 have
 have


done
 all
 of
 this
 and
 the
 company
 was


started
 in
 yeah
 June
 23
 right
 if
 I


recall


>> yeah
 and
 so
 for
 most
 of
 our
 clients
 uh


we
 we
 started
 working
 with
 them
 recently


the
 tooling
 uh
 for
 everyone
 is
 still
 in


its
 infancy
 And
 so
 I
 hope
 that
 the


tooling
 will
 stabil
 stabilize
 uh
 and
 I


hope
 that
 we
 will
 have
 true
 value.
 True


value
 to
 me
 is
 really
 okay
 we've
 gone


through
 that
 first
 phase
 of
 building


connections
 and
 now
 employees
 of
 that


enterprise
 are
 able
 to
 use
 everything


that
 we've
 built.
 Right
 now
 I
 think


we're
 in
 a
 phase
 where
 we
 build
 siloed


things
 uh
 because
 we're
 scared
 of
 uh


data
 going
 through
 walls
 and
 everything.


And
 so
 to
 me,
 the
 real
 success
 is
 when


you're
 confident
 enough
 to
 give
 all
 of


that
 control
 back
 to
 the
 company's


employees
 at
 large
 and
 they
 start
 really


building
 on
 it.


>> You're
 talking
 about
 MRO
 in
 particular


about
 the
 industry
 in
 general,
 right?
 Is


that
 do
 I
 understand
 this
 correctly?
 Uh


because
 obviously
 that's
 that's
 the
 big


question,
 right?
 we
 we
 all
 collectively


building
 this
 whole
 thing
 and
 data


centers
 and
 models
 and
 pouring
 uh


billions
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 pretty
 clear


that
 from
 a
 personal
 use
 case
 or
 uh
 from


maybe
 some
 discrete
 like
 coding
 use


cases
 like
 the
 the
 demand
 is
 very
 clear


uh
 but
 the
 big
 question
 is
 whether


demand
 is
 going
 to
 materialize
 at
 the


same
 level
 as
 the
 extraordinary
 level
 of


supply
 we're
 building


>> yeah
 around
 this
 I
 think
 the
 expectation


is
 that
 demand
 and
 basically
 amount
 of


tokens
 generated
 uh
 for
 the
 enterprise


will
 uh
 completely
 jump
 once
 you
 are
 not


bound
 anymore
 by
 humans
 asking
 questions


or
 reading
 them.
 As
 soon
 as
 you
 have


enough
 trust
 uh
 to
 have
 agents
 running


in
 the
 background,
 as
 soon
 as
 you've
 set


them
 to
 run
 a
 bunch
 of
 ETLs,
 as
 you've


got
 them
 running
 lots
 of
 workloads,
 uh


and
 you've
 got
 them
 consolidating
 data


and
 knowledge
 across
 your
 entire


company,
 then
 you're
 not
 really
 um


limited
 by
 the
 number
 of
 tokens
 that


humans
 can
 create
 or
 read.
 And
 so
 we
 I


think
 everyone
 in
 the
 industry
 expect


the
 demand
 to
 jump
 at
 that
 point.
 And


the
 reality
 is
 for
 this
 to
 happen,
 you


just
 need
 a
 lot
 of
 boring
 software
 and


control
 and
 things
 like
 this.


>> It's
 amazing
 how
 much
 uh
 all
 of
 this
 is


engineering,
 right?
 Versus
 just
 sheer


performance
 of
 uh
 of
 models.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 plumbing
 and
 the


goal
 is
 to
 make
 all
 of
 this
 plumbing


easy
 and
 easier
 and
 to
 make
 it
 faster.


>> All
 right.
 And
 you
 said
 we're
 about
 a


year
 away.
 I


>> I'm
 not
 the
 most
 optimistic
 person.
 It


might
 be
 faster.
 Uh
 who
 knows?
 And
 we
 we


talked
 about
 use
 cases
 a
 bit
 already,


but
 let's
 just
 put
 that
 one
 to
 to
 bed


because
 it's
 such
 an
 important
 question.


What
 do
 you
 think
 are
 the
 kind
 of
 the


banger
 uh
 use
 cases
 in
 the
 enterprise?


Let's
 assume
 like
 all
 agents
 work
 uh
 in


in
 a
 in
 a
 workflow
 kind
 of
 way
 that
 you


describe
 uh
 based
 on
 either
 your
 uh


industry
 watch
 or
 or
 more
 specifically


talking
 to
 your
 customers.
 What
 is
 it


that
 is
 going
 to
 generate
 a
 amazing
 ROI


beyond
 coding
 which
 is
 pretty


established
 at
 this
 at
 this
 stage?


>> Yeah,
 there
 are
 several
 dimensions
 to


this.
 Coding
 is
 an
 obvious
 one
 and
 um
 to


me
 to
 get
 the
 full
 um
 ROI
 of
 coding
 you


need
 customization.
 Uh
 because
 a
 lot
 of


ROI
 is
 unlocked
 uh
 on
 like
 sprawling


code
 bases
 that
 are
 completely


impossible
 to
 know
 for
 uh
 for
 something


that's
 been
 trained
 on
 the
 web.
 uh
 if


you've
 got
 uh
 an
 enterprise
 that's
 been


building
 its
 own
 like
 domain
 specific


languages
 for
 years,
 you'll
 need
 some


customization
 for
 an
 agent
 to
 come
 in


and
 be
 competent
 uh
 in
 that
 respect.
 Um


so
 coding
 is
 definitely
 a
 big
 one.
 Um
 if


everything
 uh
 comes
 true
 as
 I
 hope
 I


think
 there
 is
 still
 a
 huge
 jump
 in
 how


we
 accelerate
 knowledge
 worker
 um
 and
 I


believe
 the
 magical
 experience
 of
 uh
 you


go
 to
 your
 chat
 assistant
 it's
 connected


to
 your
 system
 and
 you
 can
 ask
 it


anything
 uh
 about
 the
 enterprise
 just


hasn't
 realized
 yet
 and
 it's
 really


obvious
 uh
 when
 you
 see
 the
 kind
 of


queries
 that
 people
 are
 making
 expecting


them
 to
 just
 work.
 And
 to
 me
 who's


building
 the
 system,
 it
 it
 feels
 like


magic.
 Like
 if
 you
 need
 to
 somehow
 send


an
 email
 to
 three
 people
 and
 coordinate


a
 meeting
 and
 also
 like
 gather
 data
 from


some
 BI
 system,
 it's
 just
 something
 that


requires
 um
 a
 lot
 more
 plumbing
 and


capabilities
 that
 we
 have
 today.
 Um
 so


that's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 huge
 lift.
 And
 I


think
 the
 last
 one
 which
 is
 maybe
 closer


to
 my
 heart
 is
 really
 when
 we
 start
 to


customize
 models
 to
 uh
 a
 kind
 of
 data


that
 is
 particular
 to
 an
 industry.
 So


typically
 if
 we
 uh
 work
 in
 oil
 and
 gas


they
 will
 have
 systemic
 data
 that
 we
 can


help
 uh
 understand
 and
 make
 sense
 of.
 If


we
 work
 with
 um
 computer
 assisted


designs,
 uh
 they
 might
 have
 uh
 full


databases
 of
 specific
 data
 formats
 that


are
 not
 widely
 understood
 by
 the
 most


general
 models
 yet.
 And
 if
 we
 manage
 to


build
 a
 system
 where
 in
 a
 light
 touch


way
 from
 us
 or
 in
 in
 my
 dream
 world,
 we


don't
 really
 have
 to
 intervene.
 It's
 all


uh
 self-s
 served
 for
 the
 customers.
 they


can
 consolidate
 that
 data
 and
 then
 build


themselves
 a
 model
 that
 really


understands
 what
 their
 actual
 uh
 private


IP
 is
 made
 of
 and
 make
 sense
 of
 this.
 Uh


then
 I'll
 be
 super
 happy
 and
 I
 think


there
 is
 huge
 value
 to
 unlock
 there.


>> Great.
 Where
 does
 the
 edge
 uh
 fit
 in
 all


of
 this?


>> There
 are
 a
 few
 reasons
 to
 go
 edge.
 Uh


first
 there
 are
 some
 regions
 where
 it's


more
 convenient
 to
 um
 be
 able
 to
 work


without
 internet
 and
 there
 are
 also
 a


lot
 of
 capabilities
 that
 don't


necessarily
 require
 uh
 a
 huge
 model.
 So


if
 you
 just
 need
 something
 that
 goes
 uh


voice
 to
 action
 on
 any
 device
 uh
 today


with
 uh
 typically
 the
 voxal
 models
 that


we
 develop
 this
 is
 doable.
 Again,
 an


area
 where


the
 more
 uh
 focused
 your
 use
 case
 is,


the
 smaller
 you
 can
 make
 the
 model


through
 fine-tuning
 or
 um
 through
 just


distillation
 in
 a
 in
 an
 even
 smaller


architecture.
 I
 think
 voice
 to
 uh
 action


is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 use
 case.
 I
 think


it
 will
 simplify
 a
 lot
 uh
 the
 current


stacks
 uh
 for
 these
 types
 of
 things.


There
 is
 also
 some
 privacy
 things
 uh


where
 you
 could
 imagine
 uh
 all
 of
 the


context
 consolidation
 stays
 on
 your


personal
 device
 and
 for
 most
 things
 uh


you
 can
 deal
 with
 a
 small
 model
 uh
 that


answers
 a
 lot
 of
 your
 questions
 and
 then


you
 potentially
 can
 gate
 uh
 what
 goes


out
 to
 uh
 another
 like
 cloud-based


models.
 I
 myself
 take
 the
 train
 a
 lot.


Uh
 I
 like
 having
 coding
 assistance.
 uh


having
 uh
 DevTool
 run
 on
 my
 laptop
 while


I
 code
 on
 the
 train
 is
 uh
 comfortable


despite
 the
 bad
 Wi-Fi


>> and
 uh
 presumably
 there
 are
 some
 uh


defense
 uh
 use
 cases
 as
 well.
 So
 you
 you


guys
 do
 quite
 a
 bit
 of
 defense
 work
 as
 I


understand
 it
 with
 France
 with
 with


Germany.
 I
 think
 you
 you
 mentioned
 some


partnership
 with
 Helsing
 is
 AI
 on
 drones


and
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 Is
 that
 a


reality?


>> A
 reality
 it's
 uh
 it's
 something
 that
 we


work
 on.
 Yes,
 we
 have
 a
 robotics


division
 that
 works
 with
 these
 uh


partners.
 Having
 a
 very
 um
 well-


definfined
 use
 cases
 uh
 makes
 us
 able
 to


really
 take
 the
 model
 down
 to
 u
 lighter


uh
 types
 of
 sizes.
 Um
 and
 it's
 of
 course


uh
 use
 cases
 where
 control
 is
 super


critical
 uh
 and
 you
 need
 to
 be
 um
 yeah


able
 to
 really
 validate
 the
 solution.


>> All right,
 let's
 switch
 to
 the
 model


part
 of
 the
 discussion.
 In
 December,
 you


guys
 uh
 released
 Mistrol
 3,
 which
 was
 a


big
 release
 still
 with
 thee


architecture,
 which
 is
 at
 the
 core
 of


what
 you
 guys
 have
 been
 um
 doing.
 You


mentioned
 efficiency
 uh
 earlier
 in
 the


conversation.
 maybe
 walk
 us
 through
 the


general
 thinking
 and
 and
 approach
 like


in
 a
 highly
 competitive
 world
 uh
 of
 uh


AI
 models
 both
 in
 terms
 of
 closed
 source


but
 also
 very
 much
 open
 source
 and
 all


the
 Chinese
 labs.
 What
 is
 it
 that
 you


guys
 are
 trying
 to
 do
 and
 how
 do
 you


position?
 Yeah.
 So
 we've
 released


Mistral
 Large
 3
 which
 is
 uh
 an
 MOE.
 MOEs


are
 uh
 really
 nice
 systems
 to
 train
 uh


because
 of
 the
 lower
 uh
 amount
 of
 flops


which
 uh
 makes
 us
 able
 to
 push


performances
 um
 a
 lot
 more
 uh
 during


training.
 They
 are
 not
 necessarily
 the


best
 formats
 for
 uh
 on-prem
 deployment


because
 as
 of
 today
 uh
 if
 you
 want
 to


get
 uh
 the
 best
 efficiency
 out
 of
 uh
 a


mixture
 of
 experts
 model
 you
 require
 a


lot
 of
 volume
 uh
 because
 you're
 looking


at
 deployments
 across
 dozens
 of
 GPUs


usually
 um
 and
 to
 justify
 that
 amount
 of


GPUs
 uh
 you
 need
 to
 have
 the
 right


throughput.
 We
 are
 training
 uh
 large


moes
 to
 get
 the
 best
 performance
 um
 with


the
 most
 efficiency
 during
 training.
 We


are
 also
 continuing
 to
 train
 u
 dense


models
 at
 other
 scales
 because
 depending


on
 the
 environments
 uh
 in
 which
 our


clients
 want
 to
 deploy
 this
 might
 be
 the


more
 uh
 costefficient
 solution.
 I
 think


both
 architectures
 are
 still
 valuable.


um
 on
 edge
 as
 well.
 Uh
 sometimes
 you


just
 don't
 have
 the
 RAM
 capacity
 uh
 to


deploy
 something
 like
 a
 sparse
 mixture


of
 experts
 and
 so
 going
 dense
 is
 helpful


there
 as
 well.
 But
 yeah,
 definitely
 for


training
 uh
 mixture
 of
 experts
 and
 their


lower
 flops
 are
 very
 interesting.


>> What
 is
 the
 ultimate
 goal
 of
 the
 model


effort?
 I
 mean
 clearly
 you
 guys
 are
 a


frontier
 AI
 lab
 but
 um
 are
 you
 trying
 to


create
 the
 the
 best
 models
 and
 and
 solve


AGI
 or
 are
 you
 trying
 to
 be
 the
 best


open-source
 model
 compared
 to
 the


Chinese
 labs
 or
 you
 know
 whatever
 open


source
 eventually
 comes
 out
 of
 the
 uh
 US


what
 is
 it
 that
 you're
 trying
 to
 do


>> we're
 trying
 to
 get
 the
 best
 uh
 models


that
 we
 can
 and
 the
 model
 that's
 most


useful
 for
 uh
 the
 use
 cases
 that
 we


cover
 uh
 in
 enterprise.
 And
 so
 typically


with
 the
 rise
 of
 uh
 agentic
 uh
 behavior,


one
 thing
 that's
 very
 important
 is
 how


you
 deal
 with
 uh
 various
 contexts,
 how


you
 deal
 with
 various
 um
 documents
 uh


being
 added
 to
 the
 input.
 And
 so
 having


the
 capabilities
 to
 do
 architecture


iterations
 really
 trying
 new
 things
 in


terms
 of
 model
 training
 is
 critical.
 Um


so
 we're
 pushing
 the
 boundaries
 of
 what


the
 current
 models
 can
 do
 with
 uh
 the


compute
 capacity
 that
 we
 have
 but
 we're


also
 trying
 to
 focus
 on
 the
 things
 that


are
 is
 most
 annoying
 uh
 in
 our


deployments
 today.
 And
 so
 one
 of
 the


consideration
 that
 has
 been
 solved
 with


a
 few
 harness
 uh
 tricks
 is
 the
 context


of
 uh
 those
 agentic
 systems.
 So
 it's


visible
 typically
 in
 vibe
 coding
 but


it's
 um
 definitely
 uh
 applicable
 to
 a


lot
 of
 other
 use
 cases
 where
 through
 all


of
 the
 tool
 calls
 you'll
 have
 to


uh
 consolidate
 uh
 and
 summarize
 the


context
 to
 be
 able
 to
 fit
 everything
 and


uh
 have
 the
 model
 focus
 on
 the
 right


parts.
 To
 me
 this
 is
 just
 an
 artifact
 of


the
 current
 architectures.


uh
 we're
 trying
 to
 fit
 uh
 things
 in
 a


linear
 context
 windows
 where
 essentially


the
 questions
 that
 we're
 asking
 aren't


really
 necessarily
 all
 linear.
 Um
 and
 so


we
 rely
 today
 on
 the
 file
 system
 for


this
 and
 that
 I
 think
 that
 was
 the
 big


change
 in
 u
 and
 realization
 through
 vibe


coding
 is
 that
 agents
 are
 good
 enough
 at


uh
 manipulating
 file
 systems
 that
 they


can
 use
 this
 as
 a
 replacement
 for
 uh


their
 context
 window.
 Basically
 uh
 they


can
 select
 parts
 of
 what
 they
 want
 to


read.
 they
 can
 select
 parts
 of
 the
 tool


results
 uh
 and
 this
 minimizes
 uh
 the


context
 length
 requirements.
 This
 is
 the


state
 today.
 I
 think
 we
 can
 do
 much


better
 and
 I
 think
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 uh


improvements
 to
 be
 done
 on
 those
 types


of
 uh
 questions.


>> Do
 your
 agents
 run
 on
 sandboxes?


>> It
 depends
 on
 the
 types
 of
 agents.
 Uh


but
 the
 answer
 would
 be
 yes.
 If
 it's
 uh


if
 it's
 coding
 agents,
 usually
 uh
 we


have
 uh
 sandboxes
 that
 will
 let
 the


agent
 iterate
 uh
 and
 run.
 I
 think
 the


depth
 of
 the
 uh
 isolation
 will
 depend
 on


the
 use
 case.
 Uh
 typically
 if
 the
 file


system
 is
 just
 representing
 textual


context
 and
 you're
 not
 expecting
 the


agent
 to
 do
 much
 action
 on
 it,
 then
 you


don't
 really
 need
 a
 full
 sandbox.
 Uh
 you


just
 need
 some
 representation
 of
 that


context
 as
 a
 file
 system
 and
 it
 can
 be


any
 sort
 of
 abstraction.
 But
 if
 you
 are


I
 don't
 know
 typically


running
 asynchronous
 code
 development


then
 yes
 you
 need
 a
 sandbox.


>> Great.
 What
 is
 the
 current
 constraint


that
 um
 you
 guys
 are
 facing
 to
 make
 uh


MR
 4
 when
 it
 eventually
 comes
 out
 do


much
 better
 than
 ML
 3.
 Is
 that
 a


question
 of
 MR
 compute
 or
 is
 that
 a


question
 of
 of
 data
 and
 uh
 in
 particular


are
 you
 guys
 doing
 anything
 around


synthetic
 data
 that
 you
 can
 talk
 about?


Definitely
 compute
 and
 uh
 the
 current


deployment
 that
 we
 have
 will
 help
 uh
 as


it's
 going
 to
 be
 giving
 us
 a
 lot
 more


grace
 blackwell
 capacity
 than
 we
 had
 in


the
 past.
 And
 so
 that's
 uh
 something


that
 we're
 very
 excited
 about.
 And
 when


you
 add
 uh
 compute,
 you
 also
 have
 to
 add


data.
 And
 so
 we've
 been
 hard
 at
 work
 uh


making
 sure
 that
 our
 uh
 data
 mixtures


are
 uh
 as
 high
 quality
 as
 ever
 and


growing
 in
 size.
 But
 as
 you
 mentioned,


one
 of
 the
 ways
 to
 do
 this
 is
 through


synthetic
 synthetic
 data.
 In
 terms
 of
 um


where
 we
 use
 synthetic
 data
 the
 most.
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 interesting
 work


that's
 happening
 is
 for
 the


post-training
 part
 where
 we
 can
 um
 build


environments
 uh
 that
 look
 similar
 to
 uh


an
 enterprise
 and
 then
 uh
 try
 to
 uh


synthetically
 create
 queries
 that
 are


hard
 and
 that
 will
 require
 multiple


hops.
 And
 so
 all
 of
 this
 work
 um
 is
 in


addition
 to
 the
 coding
 work,
 the


reasoning
 work
 is
 really
 what
 makes
 the


final
 model
 able
 to
 perform
 uh
 in
 the


various
 uh
 environments
 that
 we
 work
 in.


So
 before
 it
 was
 about
 uh
 acrewing
 world


knowledge
 and
 the
 uh
 web
 helps
 a
 lot


with
 this.
 Now
 it's
 more
 and
 more
 about


acquiring
 knowhow.
 Uh
 and
 for
 this
 uh


it's
 really
 about
 um
 trying
 to
 find
 what


our
 uh
 customers
 are
 trying
 to
 do,


trying
 to
 replicate
 it
 inside
 of
 our


training
 environment
 and
 uh
 let
 the
 the


model
 run
 basically.


>> You
 mentioned
 post-training
 and
 that's


one
 of
 the
 key
 topics
 of
 the
 last
 12


months
 in
 particular
 this
 evolution
 of


um
 LMS
 uh
 into
 systems
 with
 both


pre-training
 and
 post-
 training
 and
 a


lot
 of
 reinforcement
 learning.
 Where
 do


you
 guys
 uh
 fall
 in
 that
 spectrum?
 Are


you
 uh
 pushing
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 reinforcement


learning?
 Do
 you
 believe
 that


pre-training
 has
 still
 room
 to
 grow?
 How


do
 you
 think
 about
 it?


>> Yeah,
 everything
 still
 has
 room
 to
 grow.


What
 I'm
 interested
 in
 as
 the
 CTO
 is


really
 how
 you
 make
 uh
 all
 of
 the
 steps


of
 the
 pipeline
 uh
 work
 well
 together


and
 how
 everyone
 can
 uh
 develop
 most


efficiently.
 Um,
 typically
 what
 happens


in
 uh
 post
 training
 is
 that
 you
 will


have
 a
 team
 that's
 working
 on
 uh


improving
 code.
 You
 will
 have
 another


team
 that's
 improving
 um
 different
 uh


enterprise
 uh
 behaviors.
 You
 will
 have


another
 team
 that's
 uh
 improving
 on
 uh


instruction
 following.
 Uh
 and
 so
 all
 of


this
 uh
 at
 some
 point
 has
 to
 come


together
 because
 customers
 aren't
 happy


if
 you
 require
 them
 to
 deploy
 five


different
 uh
 models
 to
 get
 their
 job


done.
 There
 is
 really
 an
 internal
 engine


and
 capability
 around
 making
 all
 of


these
 work
 stream
 come
 together
 uh
 in


the
 way
 that
 you
 expect
 that
 is
 super


interesting
 to
 build
 and
 so
 but
 yeah
 uh


internally
 we're
 building
 and
 improving


all
 of
 the
 parts
 of
 the
 stack.
 I
 think


the
 post
 training
 is
 very
 rich
 because


it
 also
 touches
 all
 of
 the
 new
 use
 cases


of
 LLMs
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 been
 very


exciting
 to
 see
 just
 all
 of
 the
 the
 new


use
 case
 that
 pop
 up
 every
 day.
 Anytime


someone
 on
 Twitter
 finds
 a
 new
 exciting


things
 that
 they've
 done,
 then
 suddenly,


you
 know,
 you've
 got
 to
 make
 it
 this


proof
 of
 concept
 into
 potentially
 a
 base


capability
 on
 which
 your
 model
 will


perform
 well.
 And
 that's
 uh
 potentially


an
 entire
 stream
 of
 work
 and
 you've
 got


to
 do
 this
 efficiently
 and
 prioritize.


Well,


>> where
 doesing
 fall
 in
 all
 of
 this?
 Uh


you
 guys
 launched
 a
 reasoning
 model


called
 Magistro
 a
 few
 months
 ago.
 Is


that
 is
 that
 a
 big
 priority?
 So


reasoning
 is
 a
 a
 big
 priority
 and
 the


interesting
 thing
 about
 reasoning
 was


really
 how
 you
 can
 train
 models
 with


reinforcement
 learning.
 And
 so
 it
 was


first
 shown
 through
 reasoning
 uh
 because


the
 system
 would
 learn
 to
 create
 better


reasoning
 traces
 to
 uh
 get
 to
 better


results.
 But
 the
 system
 is
 the
 same


whether
 you
 create
 reasoning
 traces
 or


whether
 you
 iterate
 on
 the
 tools
 that


you
 call
 or
 mixing
 both.
 And
 so
 I
 think


more
 and
 more
 the
 way
 to
 train
 uh
 all
 of


this
 uh
 is
 going
 to
 come
 together
 and


sometimes
 you'll
 have
 reasoning
 traces,


sometimes
 they'll
 be
 long,
 sometimes


they'll
 be
 short,
 sometimes
 there
 won't


be
 any
 because
 it's
 not
 necessary
 and


there's
 no
 real
 difference
 between


creating
 a
 new
 thinking
 trace
 or
 calling


the
 right
 tool.
 It's
 it's
 all
 the
 same


to
 me
 because
 what
 you're
 optimizing
 at


the
 end
 is
 what
 is
 the
 best
 uh
 output


for
 the
 model
 to
 create
 before
 it
 gets
 a


results
 to
 uh
 to
 me.


>> Great.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 uh
 Devstrol


2
 and
 the
 Vibe
 CLI.
 So,
 walk
 us
 through


those
 products
 and
 what
 they
 do
 and
 uh


why
 people
 should
 use
 them.


>> Sure.
 Um
 so
 DevTool
 is
 our
 uh
 agent
 tech


coding
 model
 and
 so
 it's
 something
 that


you
 typically
 vibe
 code
 with
 and
 you
 are


more
 than
 welcome
 to
 vibe
 code
 with
 it


through
 our
 CLI
 aptly
 named
 vibe.
 Value


of
 vibe
 coding
 and
 why
 we
 focus
 on
 it.


Coding
 is
 a
 huge
 use
 case
 in
 enterprise


um
 and
 especially
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 clients


have
 uh
 yeah
 large
 code
 databases
 where


it's
 helpful
 for
 us
 uh
 to
 take
 our


system
 and
 customize
 it
 to
 their


codebase
 to
 let
 um
 our
 agent
 run.
 Now


the
 devrol
 and
 agentic
 coding
 is
 not


only
 about
 uh
 vibe
 coding
 the
 same


system
 when
 you
 run
 it
 uh
 asynchronously


can
 be
 used
 to
 review
 PRs.
 uh
 it
 can
 be


used
 to
 check
 code
 for
 specific


conditions.
 It
 can
 be
 used
 to
 modernize


code.
 So
 it's
 applications
 even
 in


coding
 are
 uh
 quite
 wide
 as
 I
 alluded
 to


as
 well.
 Um
 having
 a
 system
 that
 uh
 is


good
 at
 handling
 a
 file
 system
 is
 more


generally
 very
 interesting.
 Uh
 even
 if


you're
 not
 using
 it
 to
 code,
 you
 can
 use


it
 to
 reason
 uh
 about
 enterprise


knowledge.
 you
 can
 use
 it
 to
 connect
 to


enterprise
 systems
 and
 it's
 to
 me
 it's


the
 basis
 of
 really
 the
 enterprise


intelligence
 that
 we're
 starting
 to


build
 and
 so
 the
 big
 news
 is
 yeah
 the


that
 those
 systems
 are
 uh
 going
 GA
 uh


we've
 got
 uh
 an
 offer
 where
 chat
 users


so
 Luca
 our
 assistant
 um
 will
 also
 uh


get
 the
 ability
 to
 use
 vibe
 and
 the


associated
 models
 and
 we're
 trying
 to
 uh


basically
 make
 that
 usage
 as
 wide
 as


possible.
 Another
 thing
 that
 you
 uh


released
 reasonably
 recently
 I
 believe


is
 uh
 OCR3.
 What
 does
 that
 do?
 That


enables
 you
 to
 just
 like
 uh
 scan
 any
 uh


any
 form
 any
 document.


>> Yeah,
 OCR
 is
 a
 huge
 use
 case
 in


enterprise.
 Uh
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 customers


have
 I
 mean
 the
 typical
 example
 is
 KYC


where
 someone
 will
 submit
 a
 form
 and
 you


need
 to
 input
 that
 information
 in
 a


structured
 way
 in
 your
 systems
 or
 you


need
 to
 reason
 about
 it.
 And
 so
 OCR


interestingly
 is
 uh
 it's
 not
 the
 types


of
 systems
 that
 I
 would
 have
 expected
 uh


LLM
 to
 really
 uh
 make
 large
 strides
 on.


The
 visual
 reasoning
 and
 the
 visual


understanding
 has
 gotten
 so
 good
 that


it's
 it's
 just
 an
 easier
 way
 to
 process


things.
 Uh
 in
 my
 mind
 you
 have
 any
 sort


of
 input
 um
 and
 you
 can
 get
 the
 the
 data


that
 you
 care
 about.
 As
 I
 mentioned,


when
 you
 build
 agents,
 you
 have
 uh
 a


different
 type
 of
 inputs
 for
 the
 task


that
 you're
 trying
 to
 solve.
 Documents


and
 visual
 informations
 are
 just
 a
 very


very
 frequent
 kind
 of
 kind
 of
 input.
 Uh


sometimes
 it's
 a
 lot
 cheaper
 uh
 to
 use
 a


small
 OCR
 model
 to
 just
 get
 the
 text


that
 you
 care
 about
 and
 then
 potentially


post-process
 it
 or
 deal
 with
 it
 with


another
 system
 than
 to
 run
 it
 through
 a


large
 uh
 multimodal
 model
 that
 will
 u


basically
 do
 the
 same
 thing
 but
 at
 a


higher
 cost.
 Yeah,
 you
 mentioned


multimodel.
 To
 to
 which
 extent
 is


mistrol
 multimodel
 or
 to
 which
 extent
 is


that
 um
 voice
 is
 is
 video
 something
 that


you
 guys
 either
 do
 or
 think
 about
 or
 is


that
 just
 not
 a
 big
 enterprise
 use
 case?


So
 to
 answer
 on
 the
 first
 part
 of
 the


question
 on
 whether
 uh
 we
 build


multimodal
 models.
 Yes.
 uh
 it's
 always
 a


balance
 between
 exploring
 in
 a


direction,
 getting
 good
 capabilities
 and


getting
 the
 first
 model
 out
 there
 and


then
 integrating
 it
 uh
 into
 the
 trunk


like
 the
 main
 model
 that
 we
 use
 for


everything
 else.
 And
 so
 those
 will


always
 happen
 at
 separate
 times
 but
 for


uh
 audio
 um
 we
 have
 uh
 voxil
 as
 I


mentioned
 and
 all
 of
 our
 um
 main
 models


uh
 understand
 images
 and
 can
 reason


about
 them.
 for
 videos.
 It's
 a
 subject


that
 we
 tackle
 through
 the
 lens
 of


robotics
 uh
 first
 and
 so
 we're
 doing
 our


first
 explorations
 on
 that
 topic.


>> Okay.
 Well,
 again
 the
 the
 velocity
 uh


has
 been
 super
 interesting
 to
 uh
 to
 to


watch.
 I
 um
 again
 appreciate
 you
 your


reminding
 us
 that
 you
 guys
 have
 been


doing
 this
 for
 only
 uh
 a
 couple
 of


years.
 So
 um
 just
 uh
 very
 impressive
 all


together.
 maybe
 take
 taking
 a
 step
 back


and
 thinking
 all
 of
 this
 in
 terms
 of
 uh


engineering
 and
 lessons
 for
 for
 for


builders.
 So
 as
 we
 alluded
 to
 a
 couple


of
 times
 through
 the
 conversation
 like


you
 you
 you
 guys
 are
 doing
 a
 lot
 with
 uh


comparatively
 it's
 always
 it's
 very


relative
 in
 the
 world
 of
 AI
 less
 uh


resources.
 How
 have
 you
 uh
 been
 able
 to


do
 this
 from
 an
 efficiency
 standpoint?


We


focused
 on
 the
 parts
 that
 we
 knew
 would


provide
 the
 most
 uh
 impact
 uh
 and
 we


focused
 on
 basically
 what
 we
 could


afford
 at
 different
 times.
 So
 when
 we


started
 and
 we
 had
 uh
 enough
 resources


to
 train
 uh
 a
 few
 models
 and
 uh
 then
 we


focused
 on
 getting
 the
 data
 perfect


because
 we
 knew
 um
 this
 was
 potentially


not
 the
 most
 exciting
 part
 of
 the
 work


but
 it
 was
 absolutely
 critical
 and
 any


improvement
 uh
 on
 the
 data
 quality
 would


10x
 the
 uh
 improvements
 that
 we
 would


get
 by
 really
 um
 improving
 on
 the
 model


architecture
 or
 things
 like
 this.
 And
 so


I
 think
 it's
 focusing
 the
 right
 effort


uh
 depending
 on
 the
 scale
 and
 the
 um


yeah
 depending
 on
 the
 scale
 of
 the


company


>> and
 from
 a
 team
 uh
 building
 perspective


how
 have
 you
 gone
 about
 it
 the
 the
 three


of
 you
 the
 three
 co-founders
 have
 a
 deep


background
 in
 in
 AI
 um
 are
 you
 these
 day


focused
 mostly
 on
 building
 like
 an
 FDA


team
 or
 are
 you
 still
 uh
 building
 this


large
 kind
 of
 like
 research
 lab
 effort


and
 how
 do
 you
 uh
 think
 about
 the
 right


ratio?


>> We
 are
 growing
 uh
 all
 of
 our
 teams
 both


uh
 research
 uh
 FDES
 uh
 product


engineering
 uh
 infrastructure
 for


compute
 and
 all
 of
 the
 teams
 have
 their


own
 uh
 challenges
 in
 how
 you
 build
 and


what
 order
 you
 uh
 recruit
 people
 in.


It's
 been
 important
 to
 me
 um
 at
 the


start
 to
 I
 mean
 to
 me
 and
 uh
 and
 GM
 and


Arthur
 we
 both
 like
 the
 three
 of
 us
 were


uh
 good
 AI
 practitioners
 so
 we
 knew
 how


to
 train
 models
 and
 we
 knew
 how
 to
 code


and
 so
 we
 started
 with
 people
 like
 us
 to


get
 to
 the
 models
 trained
 the
 fastest
 um


but
 that
 doesn't
 work
 as
 you
 scale
 uh


you
 it
 is
 critical
 to
 build
 the
 right
 uh


infrastructure
 uh
 for
 research


And
 so
 this
 takes
 different
 skill
 sets.


Uh
 and
 it's
 something
 that
 we've
 been
 uh


building
 over
 the
 years
 as
 well.
 Uh
 and


it's
 fascinating
 as
 someone
 who
 used
 to


do
 uh
 research
 in
 a
 at
 a
 smaller
 scale


to
 see
 the
 kind
 of
 systems
 that
 are


involved
 and
 the
 the
 gains
 uh
 that
 you


can
 have
 at
 scale.
 Uh
 in
 terms
 of


engineering,
 it's
 kind
 of
 the
 same
 story


really.
 uh
 where
 you
 start
 with
 um
 a


team
 that's
 broad
 in
 its
 knowledge
 and


self-sufficient
 and
 can
 iterate
 fast
 and


then
 more
 and
 more
 you
 bring
 in
 experts


or
 people
 that
 are
 that
 have
 seen
 larger


scale
 and
 will
 tell
 you
 like
 well
 this


won't
 work
 in
 six
 months
 and
 so
 we


should
 fix
 that
 now.
 So,
 it's
 been
 super


interesting
 growing
 the
 company
 and


seeing
 all
 of
 the


uh
 successive
 things
 that
 break
 at
 each


scale
 and
 overcoming
 them
 through
 either


changing
 the
 system,
 changing
 the


organization
 or
 building
 new
 things.


>> How
 have
 you
 navigated
 the
 whole
 Europe


to
 US
 and
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 dimension
 of


this?
 I
 you're
 the
 very
 much
 the
 the


pride
 of
 France,
 the
 pride
 of
 uh
 Europe


as
 well
 equally.
 This
 is
 a
 global
 race.


How
 have
 you
 uh
 made
 it
 work?


>> So,
 we
 work
 um
 on
 all
 three
 continents.


We
 have
 offices
 uh
 in
 PaloAlto.
 We
 have


offices
 in
 Singapore
 as
 well.
 Most
 of


our
 employees
 work
 uh
 from
 Paris.
 It's
 a


good
 representation
 of
 uh
 what
 we're


trying
 to
 build,
 which
 is
 a
 solution


that's
 uh
 independent
 and
 that
 people


control.
 and
 in
 and
 this
 target
 uh
 it


doesn't
 really
 matter
 uh
 where
 we're


from
 or
 who
 we're
 building
 for.
 Uh
 we


provide
 the
 tools
 uh
 and
 the
 customer


the
 end
 customer
 then
 owns
 uh
 everything


that's
 built
 on
 it.
 And
 so
 I
 I
 think
 it


it
 hasn't
 really
 been
 something
 that


I've
 spent
 much
 thought
 on.


>> So
 uh
 what
 what
 should
 we
 um
 expect
 from


uh
 Mistl
 over
 the
 next
 uh
 couple
 of


years?
 Over
 the
 next
 couple
 of
 years,
 I


would
 say
 uh
 diminishing
 doubts
 on
 the


ROI
 of
 AI
 uh
 ideally
 so
 faster
 uh
 time


to
 success
 uh
 larger
 and
 larger
 uh
 use


cases
 being
 built
 and
 really


democratization


uh
 of
 building
 tools
 with
 AI
 in


enterprise.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 really
 what


I
 target
 for
 our
 customers.
 uh
 it
 should


be
 easy
 uh
 and
 most
 people
 should
 be


able
 to
 accelerate
 themselves
 through


the
 use
 of
 AI.
 I
 think
 we've
 seen
 this


happen
 quite
 uh
 impressively
 for
 coding


and
 it
 should
 be
 something
 that
 happens


uh
 a
 lot
 more
 widely.


>> I
 was
 uh
 struck
 throughout
 this
 uh


conversation
 by
 how
 pragmatic
 uh
 you
 you


are
 and
 and
 focused
 on
 precise
 goals


around
 enterprise
 success.
 What
 do
 you


make
 uh
 of
 the
 whole,
 you
 know,
 rush
 to


AGI
 conversation
 and
 people
 being
 AGI


pill
 in
 San
 Francisco
 and
 other
 places?


Is
 that
 is
 that
 something
 that
 you
 see


happening
 or
 does
 that
 to
 some
 extent


not
 matter
 from
 your
 perspective?


>> I
 mean
 it
 it
 matters
 because
 the
 the


better
 your
 systems
 are,
 the
 more
 uh


impressive
 things
 you'll
 be
 able
 to
 do


and
 it
 it'll
 become
 easier
 and
 easier.


requirements
 I
 see
 for
 control
 and


governance
 in
 enterprise


make
 me
 think
 that
 even
 if
 I
 had
 uh
 some


AGIS
 model
 on
 my
 uh
 servers
 right
 now
 if


I
 were
 to
 go
 uh
 into
 a
 large
 bank
 and


say
 here
 is
 a
 thing
 please
 let
 it


control
 everything
 for
 you
 they
 wouldn't


be
 happy
 to
 let
 it
 do
 it
 and
 so
 I
 think


building
 the
 infrastructure


uh
 properly
 is
 uh
 quite
 key
 to
 following


the
 progress
 of
 these
 models
 and
 really


being
 able
 to
 quickly
 unleash
 all
 of


their
 capabilities.
 So
 to
 me
 it's
 it's


two
 directions
 that
 are
 necessary.
 You


need
 to
 improve
 the
 capabilities
 of
 the


model
 and
 it's
 super
 exciting
 to
 do
 so


but
 the
 journey
 of
 uh
 making
 it
 trivial


and
 uh
 easy
 for
 everyone
 to
 unleash


those
 models
 on
 your
 enterprise


workflows
 uh
 without
 really
 wondering


what's
 going
 to
 happen
 is
 is
 equally


important.
 And
 honestly
 super
 uh
 super


fun
 as
 well
 to
 develop.
 There
 are
 lots


of
 super
 interesting
 questions.


>> Wonderful.
 Well,
 Timote,
 thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 uh
 doing
 this
 uh
 deep
 dive
 on


Mistrol
 with
 us.
 It's
 been
 fascinating.


Congratulations
 on
 everything
 that


you've
 built
 again
 in
 this
 very
 short


period
 of
 time.
 Uh
 and
 excited
 for


what's
 uh
 coming
 next.
 So,
 thank
 you
 for


spending
 time
 with
 us.

 was
 a
