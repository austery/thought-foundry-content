Hi
 everybody.
 Today
 I'm
 joined
 by
 Joel


Helmar
 who
 is
 the
 founder
 and
 CEO
 of


Sana
 which
 is
 an
 a
 really
 important


Swedish
 AI
 company.
 They
 specialize
 in


knowledge
 management
 and
 Joel
 is
 behind


the
 very
 important
 new
 Swedish
 AI


reform.
 Now
 this
 reform
 will
 bring
 AI


models
 to
 2.3
 million
 Swedes.
 Wow.
 What


is
 the
 Swedish
 AI
 reform?
 The
 history
 of


the
 Swedish
 AI
 reform
 goes
 back
 to
 the


90s
 where
 Sweden
 introduced
 the
 PC


reform.
 The
 PC
 reform
 was
 was
 focused
 on


providing
 a
 a
 personal
 computer
 in
 every


household.
 Um
 through
 um
 you
 know
 clever


tax
 uh
 setups,
 we
 managed
 to
 get
 one


million
 households
 with
 pieces
 and
 a
 lot


of
 folks
 credit
 you
 know
 the
 Swedish


tech
 wonder
 if
 you
 like
 coming
 from
 the


Swedish
 PC
 reform.
 So
 what
 we
 started


thinking
 about
 is
 what
 does
 the


equivalent
 for
 AI
 look
 like?
 What
 could


we
 do
 for
 AI
 to
 make
 it
 democratic


across
 Sweden?
 And
 so
 we
 set
 up
 uh
 the


Swedish
 AI
 reform.
 We're
 providing


frontier
 models
 to
 2.3
 million
 Swedes


for
 free.
 So
 that's
 all
 universities,


all
 schools,
 all
 public
 servants
 that


gets
 free
 access
 to
 all
 of
 the
 frontier


models.


>> Who
 pays
 for
 this?


>> So
 we
 decided
 to
 set
 up
 a
 structure
 uh


where
 the
 foundation
 paid
 for
 it.
 So


through
 the
 generous
 support
 of
 um
 some


of
 the
 Swedish
 some
 of
 Sweden's
 most


successful
 business
 folks
 uh
 we
 set
 up
 a


foundation
 that
 ultimately
 funded
 uh
 the


the
 access
 to
 these
 models
 that
 enabled


us
 to
 move
 super
 quickly.
 So
 uh
 during


the
 time
 of
 six
 weeks
 we
 managed
 to
 set


up
 the
 foundation
 get
 it
 funded
 and
 and


then
 start
 distributing
 these
 models
 to


to
 to
 the
 Swedish
 population.


>> And
 how
 much
 money
 are
 we
 talking
 here


if
 you
 have
 to
 put
 a
 number?
 I
 think
 for


a
 nation
 like
 like
 like
 Sweden
 um
 it's


in
 the
 sort
 of
 millions
 of
 of
 dollars
 to


to
 distribute
 it
 but
 then
 of
 course
 it


depends
 on
 the
 the
 usage
 of
 the


services.


>> So
 20
 30
 million
 Swedish.


>> Yeah
 it
 it
 can
 can
 range
 uh
 as
 you
 scale


it
 up
 but
 that
 would
 be
 a
 ballpark.


>> How
 do
 you
 split
 the
 work
 between
 the


private
 sector
 and
 the
 public
 sector


here?


>> So
 the
 private
 sector
 is
 is
 funding
 it.


The
 private
 sector
 is
 also
 building
 the


tools
 and
 we're
 collaborating
 with
 the


public
 sector
 to
 distribute
 it
 and
 so
 um


what
 what
 we
 want
 to
 focus
 on
 is
 can
 we


get
 the
 speed
 of
 of
 funding
 that
 we
 can


get
 for
 these
 initiatives
 can
 we
 get
 the


speed
 of
 the
 development
 the
 quality
 of


the
 development
 uh
 if
 these
 tools
 are


not
 consumer
 grade
 tools
 people
 are
 not


going
 to
 adopt
 them
 they
 they
 need
 to
 be


at
 the
 very
 frontier
 of
 of
 AI
 too
 but


then
 if
 we
 can
 combine
 that
 with
 the


public
 sector
 that
 of
 course
 powers
 our


societies
 and
 has
 all
 of
 the


distribution
 and
 has
 all
 of
 the
 trust.


Um,
 that's
 where
 it
 can
 be
 the
 most


effective.
 So,
 we're
 taking
 care
 of
 the


funding.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 wait
 for


government
 approvals
 to
 fund
 this.
 I


don't
 want
 to
 wait
 for
 a
 long
 process


for
 governments
 to
 develop
 these
 tools.


That's
 what
 I
 think
 we
 can
 do
 great
 in


the
 in
 in
 the
 in
 the
 private
 sector.


However,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 trust
 required


for
 this.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 distribution


required
 for
 this
 and
 that's
 what
 I


think
 the
 public
 sector
 can
 do
 can
 do


really
 well.


>> Is
 the
 public
 sector
 willing
 to


distribute
 this?
 Are
 they
 doing
 a
 good


job
 distributing
 it
 in
 Sweden?


>> Uh
 I
 I I
 think
 so.
 And
 we
 we
 have
 two


approaches.
 So
 um
 it's
 part
 bottoms
 up,


part
 tops
 down.
 So
 uh
 bottoms
 up,
 anyone


can
 sign
 up
 on
 the
 website,
 just


instantly
 get
 get
 access,
 they
 get


access
 to
 these
 AI
 tools
 that
 can


support
 them
 in
 their
 daily
 work.
 And


then
 there's
 other
 aspects
 where
 we're


doing
 more
 top
 down
 where
 we're
 talking


with
 with
 the
 leaders
 of
 different


government
 um
 institutions
 and
 then
 they


are
 distributing
 it
 in
 in
 their
 in
 their


organizations.


>> So
 just
 to
 get
 it straight
 the
 tool


basically
 you
 you
 uh
 you
 signed
 up
 to


your
 tool
 and
 behind
 the
 tool
 you
 have


different
 type
 of
 models,
 right?
 So
 it's


not
 dependent
 just
 on
 one
 uh
 one
 uh


large
 language
 model.
 It's
 just
 like
 a


range
 of
 tools.
 Is
 that
 correct


understanding?


>> Exactly.
 So
 you
 get
 access
 to
 all
 of
 the


frontier
 models.
 Whether
 you
 want
 to
 run


on
 anthropic
 or
 or
 Gemini
 or
 open
 AI


models
 or
 anything
 else,
 we
 have
 access


to
 all
 of
 the
 front
 frontier
 uh
 frontier


models.
 These
 are
 models
 that
 in
 some


cases
 can
 cost
 you
 hundreds
 of
 dollars
 a


month
 to
 get
 get
 access
 to.
 Combined


with
 that,
 we
 also
 enable
 you
 to
 connect


those
 models
 to
 your
 data
 or
 your


knowledge.
 And
 we've
 built
 this
 system


in
 a
 way
 that
 respects
 all
 of
 the
 guard


rails
 that
 you
 for
 example
 need
 in


public
 sector.


>> So
 given
 that
 I'm
 a
 bit
 thick
 u
 what's


going
 to
 happen
 Sweden
 here
 with
 all
 the


tools
 Norway
 here
 not
 applying
 the
 tools


what's
 going
 to
 happen
 to
 the
 two


countries


>> I
 think
 you
 get
 a
 compounding
 advantage


of
 using
 these
 tools
 and
 that
 advantage


will
 just
 compound
 uh
 over
 over
 time.
 So


um
 my
 expectations
 is
 the
 companies
 that


adopt
 these
 tools
 more
 effectively,


they're
 going to
 have
 more
 successful


companies,
 both
 new
 companies
 being


founded.
 That's
 what
 happened
 after
 the


PC
 reform.
 People
 learned
 how
 to
 program


and
 then
 when
 they
 learned
 how
 to


program,
 they
 founded
 Spotify
 and
 Cla


and
 and
 other
 companies
 like
 like
 that.


But
 secondly,
 the
 Swedish
 companies
 are


going
 to
 be
 more
 competitive
 because


they
 know
 how
 to
 use
 these
 tools.
 They


can,
 you
 know,
 ultimately
 it
 starts


eating
 at
 at
 your
 margins.
 are
 going
 to


be
 able
 to
 provide
 a
 better
 better


better
 product
 more
 cost-
 effectively.


Um
 and
 then
 third,
 I
 think
 um
 as
 a


society,
 we're
 going to
 have
 higher


quality
 healthcare,
 higher
 quality


education,
 and
 higher
 quality
 research.


And
 this
 every
 single
 year
 will
 just


keep
 compounding.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 the


countries
 that
 adopt
 this
 slower
 will


will
 take
 a
 very
 long
 time
 to
 to
 catch
