MCPS,
 I
 will
 say
 it's
 a
 concept
 that's


really
 hard
 to
 understand
 for
 folks.


>> Yeah,
 definitely
 don't
 think
 about
 the


word.
 It
 really
 just
 is
 like
 app


integrations
 for
 your
 AI
 tools.
 You
 can


create
 these
 collections
 of
 tools
 from


all
 the
 apps
 you
 use
 and
 give
 them


access
 to
 Claude
 to
 Chatbt
 to
 Cursor,


all
 the
 places
 that
 have
 inputs
 for
 MCP


servers
 today.


>> I
 use
 agents
 all
 the
 time,
 but
 it
 is


hard
 to
 break
 that
 muscle
 memory
 of
 this


is
 a
 deterministic
 workflow
 versus
 an


instructive
 agent.
 even
 if
 it
 has
 access


to
 the
 same
 tools
 and
 can
 do
 the
 same


things.


>> And
 when
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 it,
 the
 two


things
 we
 see
 people
 wanting
 to
 do
 is


one,
 giving
 their
 favorite
 AI
 tool
 the


access
 to
 knowledge
 that
 lives
 in
 their


apps
 as
 well
 as
 giving
 them
 the
 ability


to
 actually
 do
 things
 in
 those
 apps.


Those
 are
 the
 two
 things
 that
 if
 that


sounds
 like
 something
 that
 you
 need
 in


an
 AI
 app
 you
 use,
 look
 for
 MCP
 or


connectors
 as
 it's
 often
 being
 called


now
 as
 well
 for
 that.

>> Welcome
 back
 to
 How
 I
 AI.
 I'm
 Claire
 Vo,


product
 leader
 and
 AI
 obsessive
 here
 on


a
 mission
 to
 help
 you
 build
 better
 with


these
 new
 tools.
 Today
 I'm
 talking
 to


Reed
 Robinson,
 product
 manager
 on
 AI
 at


Zapier.
 And
 what
 I
 love
 about
 my


conversation
 with
 Reed
 is
 he's
 going
 to


show
 us
 how
 to
 put
 MCPs
 to
 work
 inside


Claude
 to
 take
 over
 tasks
 that
 you


really
 hate.
 We
 also
 talk
 about
 whether


AI
 can
 be
 the
 perfect
 always
 on
 team


that
 works
 while
 you
 sleep
 and
 some
 use


cases
 to
 make
 your
 kids
 and
 your
 partner


a
 little
 happier.
 Let's
 get
 to
 it.
 This


episode
 is
 brought
 to
 you
 by
 work
 OS.


[music]
 AI
 has
 already
 changed
 how
 we


work.
 Tools
 are
 helping
 teams
 write


better
 code,
 analyze
 customer
 data,
 and


even
 handle
 support
 tickets
 [music]


automatically.
 But
 there's
 a
 catch.


These
 tools
 only
 work
 well
 when
 they


have
 deep
 access
 to
 company
 systems.


Your
 co-pilot
 needs
 to
 see
 your
 entire


codebase.
 Your
 chatbot
 needs
 to
 search


across
 internal
 docs.
 And
 for
 enterprise


buyers,
 that
 [music]
 raises
 serious


security
 concerns.
 That's
 why
 these
 apps


face
 intense
 IT
 scrutiny
 from
 day
 one.


To
 pass,
 they
 need
 secure


authentication,
 access
 controls,
 audit


logs,
 the
 whole
 suite
 of
 enterprise


[music]
 features.
 Building
 all
 that
 from


scratch,
 it's
 a
 massive
 lift.
 That's


where
 Work
 OS
 comes
 in.
 Work
 OS
 gives


you
 [music]
 drop-in
 APIs
 for
 enterprise


features
 so
 your
 app
 can
 become


enterprise
 ready
 and
 scale
 [music]
 up


market
 faster.
 Think
 of
 it
 like
 Stripe


for
 enterprise
 features.
 OpenAI,


Perplexity,
 [music]
 and
 Cursor
 are


already
 using
 work
 OS
 to
 move
 faster
 and


meet
 enterprise
 demands.
 Join
 them
 and

 of
 other
 industry
 leaders

Start
 building
 today.
 Hey
 Reed,
 thanks


for
 joining
 how
 I
 AI.
 Thanks
 for
 having


me
 here,
 Claire.
 Excited
 to
 chat
 today.


>> What
 I
 love
 about
 how
 you've
 described


your
 role
 at
 Zapier,
 which
 I
 use
 all
 the


time,
 I
 say
 is
 like
 loadbearing


infrastructure
 over
 at
 Chat
 PRD,
 is


you've
 you've
 worked
 your
 way
 into
 a


role
 where
 you
 get
 to
 kind
 of
 like
 pick


what
 you're
 working
 on
 next
 in
 in
 AI.


And
 so
 I'd
 love
 to
 hear
 about
 what


you're
 focused
 on
 and
 how
 that's


actually
 impacted
 how
 you
 think
 some


about
 some
 of
 your
 personal
 workflows.


>> Absolutely.
 So
 yeah,
 the
 way
 I
 often


describe
 my
 role
 is
 often
 like
 sisophist


of
 AI
 at
 Zapier
 just
 pushing
 the
 rock
 up


the
 hill
 wherever
 that
 rock
 may
 be
 and


whatever
 the
 hill
 might
 be.
 Right
 now


the
 thing
 I'm
 most
 excited
 about
 and


where
 I'm
 choosing
 to
 spend
 a
 lot
 of my


time
 working
 on
 AI
 is
 on
 our
 approach
 to


MCPs.
 Uh
 so
 we've
 got
 you
 know
 a
 server


approach
 but
 as
 well
 as
 what
 we're
 doing


on
 the
 client
 side.
 you
 know,
 MCPs,
 I


will
 say,
 uh,
 still,
 I
 think,
 un
 both


kind
 of
 very
 hyped
 and
 underutilized
 by


people.
 Um,
 because
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 it's


a
 concept
 that's
 really
 hard
 to


understand
 for
 folks.
 So,
 I'd
 encourage


our
 listeners
 and
 our
 watchers
 who
 are
 a


little
 nervous
 about
 waiting
 into
 the


world
 of
 MCPs
 to
 just
 really
 think


about,
 you
 know,
 if
 I
 could
 give
 my


favorite
 AI
 chat
 client
 or
 IDE
 or


whatever
 access
 to
 a
 bunch
 of
 tools
 to


do
 things
 for
 me,
 um,
 what
 would
 I
 want


them
 to
 do
 and
 then
 go
 hunt
 for
 an
 MCP


that
 that
 does
 that
 thing.
 And
 I
 think


you
 have
 have
 built
 a
 product
 that
 has


tried
 to
 abstract
 away
 some
 of
 that


complexity
 for
 Zapier
 users
 at
 least.


Could
 you
 walk
 us
 through
 kind
 of
 a


little
 bit
 of
 your
 approach
 there?


>> Yeah,
 absolutely.
 And
 I
 I
 think
 you
 said


it
 really
 well.
 The
 two
 kind
 of
 use


cases
 I
 give
 people
 to
 just
 like
 I
 don't


know
 think
 about
 MCPS
 is
 Yeah,


definitely
 don't
 think
 about
 the
 word.


It
 really
 just
 is
 like
 app
 integrations


for
 your
 AI
 tools.
 And
 when
 it
 comes


down
 to
 it,
 the
 two
 things
 we
 see
 people


wanting
 to
 do
 is
 one
 giving
 their


favorite
 AI
 tool
 access
 to
 knowledge


that
 lives
 in
 their
 apps
 as
 well
 as


giving
 them
 the
 ability
 to
 actually
 do


things
 in
 those
 apps.
 So,
 it's
 really


those
 are
 the
 two
 things
 that
 if
 like


that
 sounds
 like
 something
 that
 you
 need


in
 an
 AI
 app
 you
 use,
 look
 for
 MCP
 or


connectors
 as
 it's
 often
 being
 called


now
 as
 well
 uh
 for
 that.
 And
 yeah,
 the


approach
 that
 Zapier
 took
 for
 anybody


not
 familiar
 with
 Zapier.
 Uh
 we're
 like


uh
 one
 of
 the
 world's
 largest
 AI


orchestration
 automation
 platforms.
 And


what
 that
 really
 means
 on
 the
 MCP
 side


is
 we've
 got
 8,000
 apps
 on
 Zapier
 that


are
 like
 every
 SAS
 app
 you
 can
 imagine.


There's
 30,000
 searches
 and
 actions


amongst
 that.
 And
 that's
 all
 exposed
 via


Zapier
 MCP.
 So
 you
 can
 create
 these
 like


collections
 of
 tools
 from
 all
 the
 apps


you
 use
 and
 give
 them
 access
 to
 claude


to
 chatbt
 to
 cursor
 to
 all
 the
 places


that
 have
 kind
 of
 inputs
 for
 MCP
 servers


today.


>> Do
 you
 mind
 pulling
 that
 up
 and
 just


showing
 us
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 what
 that


that
 looks
 like?
 And
 while
 you're


pulling
 up
 your
 screen,
 I
 do
 bless
 you


MCP
 framework
 provider.
 Um,
 but
 we
 gota


work
 we
 got
 to
 work
 on
 the
 branding


here.
 So
 I
 think
 your
 description
 is


exactly
 right
 like
 app
 connectors
 for


for
 your
 AI
 is
 such
 a
 simpler
 way
 for


the
 everyday
 consumer
 to
 understand


this.
 Um,
 and
 so
 okay
 so
 you're
 showing


us
 Zapier
 here
 for
 folks
 that
 are
 just


listening
 and
 just
 can
 you
 walk
 through


in
 oh
 you
 have
 8,000
 tools
 that
 or
 8,000


apps
 you
 can
 add
 tools
 from.
 So
 this
 is


your
 MCP
 server
 that
 you've
 added
 a


custom
 set
 of
 tools
 that
 you're
 going
 to


use
 pretty
 consistently
 either
 for
 a
 use


case
 or
 just
 as
 a
 as
 an
 individual,


right?


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 And
 so
 the
 way
 that
 it


works
 is
 I
 kind
 of
 set
 up
 the
 ones
 that


I'm
 using
 specifically
 for
 Claude.
 Uh


and
 so
 what's
 nice
 on
 Zapier
 side
 unlike


many
 other
 MCP
 servers
 is
 we
 actually


are
 more
 like
 a
 platform
 for
 creating


servers.
 So
 you
 can
 create
 multiple
 and


what
 that
 means
 is
 you
 can
 create


specific
 sets
 of
 tools
 to
 use
 with


claude
 or
 with
 a
 particular
 agent
 or


with
 chatbt
 or
 with
 cursor
 uh
 really


anything
 out
 there
 that
 supports
 it.
 Um,


which
 is
 nice
 cuz
 for
 me
 those
 tools
 are


different
 from
 one
 place
 to
 the
 other.


And
 yeah,
 you
 can
 see
 or
 for
 those
 who


can't
 see,
 uh,
 you
 can
 add
 tools
 from


things
 like
 Slack,
 Evernotes,
 Glean,


Koda,
 Google
 Calendar,
 and
 you
 can


actually
 start
 to
 customize
 those
 tools


as
 well.
 Um
 so
 whether
 you
 want
 to
 like


restrict
 them
 to
 using
 certain
 uh


databases
 like
 I've
 done
 with
 Kod
 I
 for


my
 use
 within
 claude
 I
 really
 I'm
 using


it
 for
 particular
 documents
 and


particular
 sheets
 for
 instance
 um
 and


other
 sides
 like
 with
 Evernote
 I
 want
 to


restrict
 it
 to
 writing
 to
 certain


notebooks.
 Uh
 so
 it
 really
 allows
 you
 to


like
 customize
 the
 way
 you
 want
 your


tool
 to
 work
 in
 different
 places.
 uh


which
 is
 quite
 nice
 because
 then
 it's


like
 a
 single
 URL
 to
 give
 over
 to
 Claude


and
 connect
 to.
 And
 now
 if
 I
 switch
 over


to
 Claude
 here,
 uh
 you
 can
 see
 that


Claude
 now
 has
 like
 a
 single
 Zapier


connector,
 but
 in
 that
 Zapier
 connector


is
 like
 all
 of
 the
 different
 tools
 that


I
 want
 Claude
 to
 be
 able
 to
 access.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


I'll
 call
 out
 for
 the
 sort
 of
 more


advanced
 MCP
 users
 and
 a
 challenge
 that


I've
 always
 had
 is
 when
 you're
 adding


these
 individual
 MCP,
 like
 there's
 a


Google
 calendar
 MCP
 and
 I'm
 sure
 there's


a
 KOD
 MCP
 is
 when
 you're
 adding
 these


individual
 ones,
 you
 kind
 of
 have
 to
 do


that
 configuration
 at
 the
 provider


level.
 Um,
 and
 what
 I
 like
 about
 this


approach
 is
 like
 this
 custom
 collection


of
 tools
 is
 actually
 a
 really
 nice
 way


to
 think
 about
 the
 MCP
 tools
 that
 you


need.
 Um,
 either
 just
 in
 general
 or
 for


a
 specific
 use
 case.
 And
 then
 for
 um,


MCP
 clients
 out
 there,
 I
 just
 I
 think


we're
 going
 to
 need
 at
 some
 point
 more


and
 I
 know
 you're
 working
 on
 this,
 but


like
 you
 just
 need
 more
 granular
 control


over
 tools
 pri
 I
 mean
 like
 priority.
 I


think
 of
 tool
 calling
 is
 really


important.
 I
 have
 um
 two
 MCPs
 that
 I
 use


really
 frequently
 in
 cursor
 and
 they're


always
 like
 competing
 for
 which
 one
 I'm


trying
 to
 call
 because
 I
 say
 it's
 like


it's
 like
 search
 projects.
 Everything


has
 projects
 in
 it.
 Always
 calls
 the


wrong
 wrong
 MCP.
 And
 so
 I
 do
 think
 like


the
 the
 meta
 abstractions
 around
 MCPS


are
 going
 to
 start
 being
 more
 important


as
 they
 become
 more
 adopted.
 So
 that's


Claire's
 uh
 manifesto
 on
 MCP
 MCP
 design.


All
 right.
 So,
 you
 have
 this
 custom
 MCP.


I
 mean,
 what
 are
 specific
 things
 this


unlocks
 for
 you?
 So,
 what
 use
 cases
 are


are
 you
 using
 here
 to
 actually
 get
 more


work
 done?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 for
 me,
 there's
 like
 things


that
 I
 don't
 love
 doing
 um
 is
 really


where
 it
 helps
 me.
 Uh
 so,
 one
 like
 and


for
 one
 of the
 things
 you
 just
 touched


on,
 which
 is
 like
 the
 model's
 ability


today
 to
 pick
 which
 tool
 is
 a
 bit
 murky.


Um
 I
 think
 Claude
 is
 a
 phenomenal
 place.


They've
 done
 a
 great
 job
 with
 tool


calling.
 One
 of
 the
 tricks
 for
 anybody


listening
 uh
 check
 out
 cloud
 projects.


Uh
 in
 particular,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


you
 can
 do
 in
 cloud
 projects
 is
 provide


very
 like
 detailed
 instructions
 for
 use


cases.
 And
 so
 for
 instance,
 I'll
 show


I'll
 share
 my
 screen
 here,
 but
 I
 have


one
 that's
 all
 about
 the
 way
 I
 like


logging
 and
 looking
 up
 data
 from
 CRM


from
 our
 CRM
 for
 things.
 And
 I've


actually
 told
 it
 like
 how
 it
 should
 use


tools,
 in
 which
 order
 it
 should
 use


tools,
 what
 data
 should
 go
 where
 when


it's
 creating
 records
 in
 those
 with


those
 tools.
 And
 it
 when
 so
 then
 in


Claude
 when
 I'm
 trying
 to
 do
 things,
 I


can
 actually
 be
 like,
 oh,
 I'm
 doing
 a


CRM
 thing.
 I'm
 actually
 going
 to
 go


ahead
 and
 select
 my
 CRM
 project
 and
 then


shoot
 over
 a
 message.
 And
 now
 Claude's


ability
 to
 like
 execute
 across
 many


different
 tools
 sequentially
 uh
 is
 so


much
 better.
 Uh,
 so
 I'd
 highly
 recommend


if
 anybody's
 like
 running
 into
 those


things,
 try
 out
 projects.
 Um,
 highly


recommend
 it.


>> Yeah,
 I've
 heard
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 talk


about
 using
 cloud
 projects
 for


knowledge,
 like
 loading
 it
 up
 with


knowledge,
 but
 I
 haven't
 heard
 anybody


talk
 about
 what
 you
 specifically
 gave
 as


an
 example,
 which
 is
 use
 cloud
 projects


to
 give
 specific
 instructions
 relative


to
 MCP
 tool
 usage
 and
 a
 workflow.
 And
 so


folks,
 listen
 up.
 You
 can
 do
 that
 in


cloud
 projects
 um
 and
 probably
 other


clients
 to
 just
 make
 your
 your
 use
 of


your
 tools
 more
 efficient.
 Okay,
 so
 you


have
 this
 cloud
 project.
 It
 looks
 like


one
 of
 the
 things
 you
 hate
 doing
 is


updating
 your
 CRM.
 Um
 like
 like
 a
 true


account.


[laughter]


Um
 I
 I
 I
 do
 actually
 tell
 people
 um
 MCPs


are
 highly
 underappreciated
 by
 customerf


facing
 teams.
 Like
 what
 what
 do


customerf
 facing
 teams
 hate
 doing?


updating
 Salesforce,
 we
 hate
 it.
 We
 hate


it.
 And
 so
 like,
 you
 know,
 keeping
 good


customer
 records,
 whether
 it's
 for
 a


sales
 use
 case,
 a
 research
 use
 case,


whatever,
 is
 like
 really
 tedious
 and


they're
 actually
 amazing
 MCPs
 out
 there


to
 do
 this.
 So,
 uh,
 I
 love
 to
 see
 how


how
 this
 works
 in
 your
 flow.


>> Yeah,
 absolutely.
 So,
 we
 know
 first
 one


of
 the
 first
 things
 I
 do
 is
 I
 have
 my


daily
 planning
 one
 and
 that
 actually


like
 goes
 through
 my
 full
 calendar
 and


one
 of
 the
 nice
 things
 is
 I've
 given
 it


access
 to
 like
 internal
 uh
 lookup
 tools.


So,
 for
 instance,
 when
 I
 run
 this,
 it


can
 actually
 look
 up
 the
 person
 I'm


meetings
 with,
 uh,
 Zapier
 usage,
 their


company's
 Zapier
 usage,
 our
 past
 sales


interaction
 with
 them,
 and
 it's
 able
 to


like
 follow
 the
 process
 of
 doing
 all


that
 lookup,
 and
 then
 when
 it
 comes
 back


with
 ultimately
 my
 daily
 update,
 it
 has


all
 of
 that
 research
 included.
 So,


again,
 really
 one
 that
 I've
 helped
 a
 lot


of
 our
 sales
 team
 uh,
 get
 set
 up
 with,


and
 we've
 actually
 been
 like
 demoing
 it


uh,
 when
 we
 go
 to
 like
 events.
 Uh,


that's
 been
 pretty
 fun.
 But
 yeah,
 on
 the


CRM
 side,
 so
 let's
 say
 that
 I
 have
 the


biggest
 one
 for
 me
 is
 actually
 my
 like


postmeating
 notes
 management.
 Uh
 I
 I'm
 a


big
 fan
 of
 Granola.
 They're
 a
 great


tool.
 Uh
 but
 I
 struggle
 with
 the
 fact


that
 sometimes
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 log
 those


notes
 or
 I
 don't
 do
 it
 all
 the
 time.
 Um


or
 it
 can
 just
 be
 really
 tedious
 to
 go


about
 doing
 that.
 And
 so
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 I
 found
 really
 helpful
 here


is
 I
 can
 I
 have
 like
 a
 cloud
 project


that
 has
 a
 bunch
 of
 instructions
 on
 just


how
 to
 log
 this
 data,
 where
 should
 it


log,
 and
 then
 I
 can
 go
 in
 and
 actually


select
 that
 project.
 Um,
 and
 then
 what


it
 can
 do
 is
 it
 should
 be
 a
 it'll
 have


access
 to
 all
 the
 tools
 and
 it'll
 start


like
 running
 it
 through
 uh
 for
 this.
 And


now
 this
 one's
 going
 to
 be
 interesting


because
 I'm
 I
 have
 the
 project


configured
 to
 like
 our
 production


database
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 try
 it
 with
 a


different
 one.
 So
 let's
 see
 if
 this


works
 for
 that.
 But
 it
 should
 be


checking
 against
 this
 kod
 document
 uh


for
 things
 and
 seeing
 like
 what
 are
 the


interviews
 I
 have
 scheduled
 and
 what
 are


the
 things
 that
 are
 coming
 up.
 And
 if
 I


go
 back
 to
 my
 little
 buddy
 claude
 here,


it's
 going
 to
 tell
 me
 that
 sure
 enough


nothing
 was
 found.
 Uh
 then
 it
 can
 choose


to,
 you
 know,
 start
 doing
 additional


things
 where
 I've
 taught
 it
 to
 like
 use


our
 internal
 lookup
 to
 find
 this


person's
 thing.
 Uh
 I'm
 going
 to
 skip


this
 for
 now.
 Don't
 want
 to
 pull
 in


actual
 stuff
 here.
 And
 then
 some
 other


things
 is
 glean.
 Like
 now
 I've
 given
 it


an
 action
 uh
 as
 well
 to
 search
 like
 our


internal
 Glean
 uh
 tool
 which
 is
 awesome


because
 then
 I
 could
 see
 like
 oh
 well
 we


talked
 about
 this
 customer
 in
 Slack
 or


we
 had
 notes
 from
 the
 CSM
 on
 what
 this


meeting's
 supposed
 to
 be
 about.
 So
 it


helps
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 that.
 And
 then


eventually
 what
 it
 gets
 into
 doing
 is


start
 to
 say
 like,
 okay,
 this
 didn't


exist.
 Here's
 what
 I
 looked
 up
 based
 on


the
 notes
 from
 the
 meeting.
 Like,
 let
 me


go
 create
 that
 and
 run
 with
 it.


>> And
 that
 updates
 your
 KOD
 with
 what?


>> Ah,
 so
 yeah,
 that
 updates
 the
 COD
 with


like
 and
 this
 is
 I'm
 doing
 a
 demo
 in


here
 for
 y'all.
 Um,
 essentially
 like
 the


KOD
 that
 I
 do
 have
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 times


I
 work
 on
 some
 of
 our
 like
 new
 products


or
 new
 features.
 I'm
 doing
 like
 customer


research
 in
 these
 like
 smaller
 dedicated


sprints.
 And
 so
 we
 typically
 will
 have


something
 in
 KOD.
 I
 might
 also
 need
 to


update
 our
 actual
 CRM
 which
 will
 use


HubSpot
 as
 well.
 So
 I'd
 have
 that
 as


like
 an
 additional
 tool
 to
 log
 it
 as
 an


activity
 on
 the
 meeting.
 But
 for
 the


most
 part,
 I'm
 making
 sure
 that
 I
 have
 a


record
 of
 this
 meeting.
 Uh
 who
 I
 met


with,
 what
 if
 there
 were
 next
 steps,


what
 were
 the
 next
 steps.
 Uh
 it'll


include
 some
 details
 on
 like
 what
 is
 if


there's
 a
 bigger
 opportunity,
 like
 what


are
 the
 opportunity
 details.
 um
 you
 can


really
 get
 it
 to
 include
 a
 lot
 of


things.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 where
 if
 I
 go


back
 to
 the
 prompt
 for
 a
 second,
 uh


things
 like
 this
 here
 where
 you'll
 see
 I


t
 I
 kind
 of
 like
 I
 don't know
 our
 users


always
 say
 they
 train
 the
 model.
 So
 if


that
 makes
 sense
 to
 you,
 you
 can
 train


the
 model
 uh
 on
 how
 to
 populate
 your
 CRM


fields
 because
 everybody's
 CRM
 fields


are
 unique,
 right?
 Like
 nobody
 uses
 uh


standard
 cookie
 cutter
 CRM
 for
 the
 most


part.
 Um
 folks
 love
 their
 custom
 fields.


Um,
 but
 models
 don't
 know
 what
 those


custom
 fields
 are
 and
 what
 those
 choices


are.
 So,
 great
 way
 again
 just
 to
 get
 it


to
 be
 familiar
 with
 you
 and
 working


specifically
 for
 you.


>> What
 I
 think
 is
 really
 interesting
 here


again
 as
 like
 a
 power
 Zapier
 user
 is
 I


have
 a
 similar
 flow
 which
 is
 I
 take


granola
 transcripts.
 I
 use
 the
 granola


um
 app
 in
 Zapier
 but
 I
 have
 mapped
 this


out
 in
 the
 standard
 workflow
 builder.
 So


I
 have
 done
 the
 I
 think
 now
 that
 I'm


seeing
 this
 the
 inefficient
 task
 of


saying
 okay
 like
 if
 this
 look
 up
 this


record
 if
 the
 record
 doesn't
 exist
 do


that
 if
 the
 record
 does
 exist
 do
 this


and
 so
 I
 have
 this
 like
 very
 similar
 CRM


record
 updating
 flow
 in
 Zapier
 um
 but


it's
 very
 step-by-step
 kind
 of
 like


deterministic
 workflow
 and
 what
 I
 like


about
 this
 and
 I
 should
 be
 doing
 better


because
 I'm
 supposed
 to
 be
 like
 fairy


godmother
 of
 AI
 I
 you
 can
 actually
 just


in
 natural
 language
 describe
 that
 flow


and
 I
 know
 this
 I
 use
 agents
 all
 the


time
 but
 it
 is
 hard
 to
 break
 that
 muscle


memory
 of
 like
 this
 is
 a
 you
 know
 a


deterministic
 workflow
 versus
 an


instructive
 agent
 even
 if
 it
 has
 access


to
 the
 same
 tools
 and
 can
 do
 the
 same


things.
 And
 so
 have
 you
 found
 that


one
 one
 path
 or
 the
 other
 is
 more
 or


less
 brittle?
 Meaning
 like


is
 is
 this
 actually
 more
 resilient
 this


sort
 of
 like
 MCP
 agentic
 instructions


piece
 more
 resilient
 to
 the
 complexities


of
 your
 data
 or
 do
 you
 find
 that
 it


fails
 more
 or
 less
 than
 like
 kind
 of


these
 nice
 uh
 netted
 out
 workflows?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 a
 very
 good
 question.
 I
 think


the
 on
 the
 kind
 of
 reliability
 or
 where


they
 fail,
 they're
 they've
 got
 their


like
 pros
 and
 cons.
 The
 pros
 of
 doing


things
 like
 asynchronously
 is
 certainly


things
 can
 take
 longer.
 Uh
 like
 one
 of


the
 biggest
 challenges
 right
 now
 with


MCP
 stuff
 is
 they
 just
 they
 can't
 take


that
 long.
 Um
 and
 so
 if
 you
 have
 like
 a


lookup
 process
 that
 might
 take
 like


seven
 minutes,
 like
 that's
 not
 going
 to


work
 here.
 uh
 where
 that
 does
 you
 can


start
 to
 do
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 that
 in
 like


deterministic
 workflow
 land
 so
 to
 speak.


Um
 the
 other
 big
 thing
 though
 to
 be


honest
 like
 the
 distinction
 that
 I
 that


what
 it
 really
 boils
 down
 to
 cuz
 Zapier


also
 has
 an
 agents
 product
 where
 you


could
 do
 this
 as
 an
 agent
 thing
 but


really
 what
 this
 boils
 down
 to
 is
 just


giving
 the
 tools
 giving
 the
 knowledge


and
 the
 ability
 to
 take
 actions
 to
 the


all
 the
 AI
 apps
 where
 you
 use
 them.
 It's


kind
 of
 like
 the
 old
 product
 thing
 about


like
 you
 know
 meeting
 your
 user
 where


they
 are
 right
 uh
 right
 place
 right
 time


and
 I
 have
 found
 that
 that
 is
 probably


the
 biggest
 thing
 because
 there
 are
 so


many
 times
 where
 I
 am
 you
 know
 like
 if


for
 anybody
 with
 keen
 eyes
 you
 would


have
 saw
 one
 of
 the
 projects
 I
 have
 here


is
 actually
 even
 like
 idea
 jammer
 I
 have


a
 whole
 project
 dedic
 hooked
 up
 to


different
 tables
 and
 stuff
 like
 that
 for


myself
 when
 I'm
 just
 like
 jamming
 on
 a


topic
 and
 it
 then
 will
 like
 research


like
 have
 we
 explored
 similar
 ideas
 or


where
 might
 this
 be
 relevant
 and
 it
 has


more
 train
 more
 like
 uh
 prompting
 there


to
 like
 challenge
 me
 and
 certain


methodologies
 to
 challenge
 me
 on
 that.


So,
 it
 really
 boils
 down
 to
 just
 like


meeting
 people.
 And
 I'll
 be
 clear
 like


one
 of
 the
 things
 we're
 seeing
 though


from
 like
 enterprises
 that
 are
 that
 are


adopting
 this
 is
 the
 fact
 that
 they're


trying
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 these
 tools


work
 for
 all
 of
 their
 employees
 like


automatically
 so
 that
 if
 they've
 rolled


out
 claw
 for
 the
 entire
 organization


when
 they
 log
 in
 and
 they
 connect
 to


appear
 it
 like
 has
 the
 tools
 that
 they


should
 need
 for
 their
 role
 that
 it's


created
 by
 some
 like
 ops
 admin
 or


someone.
 Yeah.


>> Um,
 and
 that's
 been
 really
 powerful.


>> As
 an
 AI
 founder,
 you're
 used
 [music]
 to


sprinting
 towards
 product
 market
 fit,


your
 next
 round,
 or
 that
 first


enterprise
 contract.
 But
 speed
 [music]


isn't
 enough
 for
 AI
 startups.
 Buyers


expect
 security,
 compliance,
 and


transparency
 from
 day
 one.
 That's
 why


serious
 AI
 startups
 use
 [music]
 Vanta.


With
 deep
 integrations
 and
 automated


workflows
 built
 for
 fastm
 moving
 AI


teams,
 Vanta
 gets
 you
 audit
 [music]


ready
 fast
 and
 keeps
 you
 secure
 with


continuous
 monitoring
 as
 your
 models,


[music]
 infra,
 and
 customers
 evolve.
 AI


innovators
 like
 Langchain,
 Writer,
 and


Cursor
 [music]
 scaled
 faster
 and
 closed


bigger
 deals
 by
 getting
 security
 right


early
 with
 Vanta.
 [music]
 Listeners
 can


claim
 a
 special
 offer
 of
 $1,000
 off


Vanta
 at
 vanta.comhowi.


There
 are
 pros
 and
 cons
 to
 each.
 You


know,
 you
 mentioned
 three
 different


methodologies.
 There's
 MCPs
 put
 in
 like


the
 client
 where
 you're
 actually


working.
 There's
 agents
 which
 do
 some
 of


this
 and
 like
 sort
 of
 a
 native
 client.


Then
 there's
 these
 deterministic


workflows
 and
 you
 do
 have
 a
 workflow


that
 does
 use
 AI
 within
 a
 more


deterministic


flow.
 So
 do
 you
 want
 to
 walk
 us
 through


through
 that
 one
 and
 just
 talk
 about
 why


you
 selected
 this
 kind
 of
 model
 of


implementation
 for
 this
 particular
 use


case?


>> Yeah,
 absolutely.
 So
 one
 of
 the
 things


for
 me
 again
 I
 like
 prep
 for
 a
 lot
 of


customer
 interviews
 and
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of


data
 and
 sometimes
 one
 of
 the
 most


embarrassing
 things
 for
 me
 or
 it
 feels


embarrassing
 is
 when
 I
 get
 on
 a
 call


with
 a
 customer
 and
 they're
 like
 just
 a


user
 interview
 that
 may
 have
 booked
 it


via
 LinkedIn.
 They
 may
 have
 booked
 it


via
 a
 referral
 from
 someone
 at
 a


partner,
 right?
 Like
 they
 come
 in
 from


all
 over
 the
 place.
 Like
 my
 Calendarly


link
 seems
 to
 like
 spread
 um
 decently


wide.
 And
 sometimes
 I'll
 get
 on
 a
 call


previously
 and
 I'd
 be
 like,
 I
 don't
 know


who
 you
 are.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 your


company
 uses
 Zappier.
 I
 don't
 know
 if


they,
 you
 know,
 and
 sometimes
 they're


like,
 oh
 yeah,
 we're
 both
 a
 customer
 and


a
 uh
 partner,
 right?
 And
 I'm
 like,


whoops.
 I
 didn't
 know
 that.
 Um
 and
 so


what
 I
 and
 what
 I
 worked
 with
 and
 our


salesfacing
 team
 had
 similar
 issues.
 And


so
 one
 of
 the
 first
 things
 that
 we
 did


was
 we
 used
 data
 bricks
 which
 houses


like
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 data
 and
 makes
 that


usable.
 And
 so
 they
 built
 like
 this


whole
 series
 of
 things
 that
 allows
 like


just
 simple
 lookup
 for
 you
 know
 given
 an


email
 address
 come
 back
 with
 like
 a


whole
 write
 up
 of
 it.
 And
 so
 essentially


this
 is
 a
 fancy
 looking
 workflow.
 Uh
 but


the
 gist
 of
 it
 is
 that
 forever
 the


meetings
 that
 I'm
 having
 it
 goes
 out


fetches
 that
 like
 research
 lookup
 which


takes
 time
 and
 then
 it
 deciphers
 that


into
 a
 like
 it
 uses
 actually
 a
 Gemini


step
 since
 it
 handles
 my
 like
 the
 the


document
 type
 that
 I
 was
 working
 with


and
 creates
 the
 or
 appends
 it


technically
 to
 the
 KOD
 page
 for
 that


customer
 interview.
 And
 so
 this
 is


really
 helpful
 for
 me
 again
 because
 it's


just
 like
 now
 when
 I'm
 going
 into
 my


meetings,
 I
 get
 things
 like
 this
 where


this
 is
 also
 where
 I'll
 like
 take
 some


of
 my
 notes.
 Um,
 and
 so
 I
 can
 actually


see
 like,
 oh,
 how
 they
 did
 use
 it
 and


get
 some
 really
 like
 crisp
 things
 uh
 to


walk
 into
 the
 meeting
 knowing.
 And
 I


think
 for
 anybody
 especially
 in
 bigger


companies
 like
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


challenges
 we
 consistently
 see
 is
 they


just
 like
 they're
 using
 when
 they
 start


to
 use
 AI
 they're
 using
 like
 the
 base


models
 with
 like
 no
 additional
 context


aheaded
 and
 so
 the
 unlocks
 for
 them


often
 become
 how
 do
 you
 get
 your
 whole


sales
 team
 to
 not
 only
 like
 use
 AI
 to


log
 things
 but
 also
 like
 fetch


information
 from
 their
 CRM
 and
 from


their
 data
 systems
 uh
 when
 and
 where


they
 need
 it.
 Um,
 and
 that
 becomes


really
 cool
 because,
 you
 know,


technically
 I
 could
 then
 throw
 like
 data


bricks
 lookups
 into
 an
 MCP
 tool
 and
 put


that
 to
 claude.
 Um,
 gets
 really
 funky.


Uh,
 those
 typically
 take
 too
 long


though.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 if
 you
 are
 uh
 the
 AI


sophist,


one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 might
 recommend
 and


I
 think
 you
 probably
 would
 as
 well
 is


you
 like
 buddy
 buddy
 buddy
 up
 to
 the


data
 engineering
 team.
 That's
 for
 sure.


Um,
 because
 that's
 a
 really
 useful


source
 of
 interesting
 rich
 information.


And
 then
 one
 other
 thing
 I
 want
 to
 call


out
 that
 may
 have
 zipped
 by
 people,


especially
 those
 that
 are
 listening,
 is


if
 you
 go
 into
 your
 user
 context
 zap


that
 you
 just
 showed
 us,
 you
 chose


Google
 Gemini.
 And
 I
 just
 want
 to


reiterate
 why.
 Um,
 because
 I've
 heard


this
 a
 lot
 from
 different
 different


guests,
 which
 is
 the
 Google
 models
 in


particular
 are
 just
 like
 great
 at
 files.


They
 love
 a
 file.
 They're
 it's
 it's


great
 at
 files.
 So
 Gemini
 um
 really
 good


at
 large
 files,
 files,
 context,
 video


files,
 audio
 files.
 And
 so
 anytime
 you


have
 sort
 of
 like
 a
 filebased


um
 challenge
 ahead
 of
 you
 or
 or
 use


case,
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 um
 AI
 power
 users


reaching
 for
 the
 Gemini
 models,
 is
 that


what
 drove
 this
 particular
 use
 case?


>> Yep,
 you
 nailed
 it.


>> Um
 yeah,
 the
 output
 from
 our
 data
 team


is
 actually
 to
 date
 a
 PDF.


>> Um
 and
 so
 it
 works
 very
 well.
 um
 with


that
 actually
 it's
 HTML
 that
 was
 the


what
 so
 I
 convert
 the
 HTML
 to
 a
 file


because
 then
 it
 works
 really
 really
 well


um
 and
 a
 lot
 less
 tokens
 which
 is
 nice


>> yeah
 I
 mean
 it's
 interesting
 the


ascendancy
 of
 the
 markdown
 file
 for
 you


know
 the
 open
 AAI
 and
 anthropic
 models


or
 chat
 GPT
 and
 claude
 and
 I
 do
 think


Gemini
 has
 taken
 this
 like
 side
 angle


where
 it's
 like
 you
 know
 you
 but
 if
 you


have
 a
 PDF
 or
 if
 you
 have
 some
 other


file
 format
 where
 where
 where
 your
 model


so
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 interesting
 for


folks
 who
 want
 to
 go
 to
 the
 next
 level


of
 implementation.
 Again,
 to
 not
 only


feed
 rich
 context
 into
 their
 AI
 use


cases,
 but
 also
 really
 understand
 a


couple
 of
 the
 highle
 nuances
 of
 the


major
 commercial
 models,
 so
 you're


picking
 the
 right
 one
 because
 I
 I
 would


guess
 you'd
 get
 a
 worse
 output
 with
 a


with
 a
 different
 model
 just
 because
 of


the
 the
 data
 input.
 Okay,
 that
 is
 super


super
 useful.
 And
 then
 um
 so
 you've


talked
 a
 lot
 about
 customer


interactions,
 right?
 CRM
 updates,


meetings,
 but
 you
 also
 get
 a
 lot
 of


asynchronous
 customer
 feedback.
 Um,


including
 from
 me
 and
 shout
 out,
 uh,


whoever
 is
 on
 the
 receiving
 end
 of
 my


support
 and
 product
 feedback
 tickets.


Thank
 you.
 I
 appreciate
 you.
 You're


always
 really,
 really
 responsive.
 How
 do


you
 drive
 that
 responsiveness


using
 AI
 or
 systematically
 across
 a


pretty
 large
 customer
 footprint?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 fun.
 Um
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


things
 I
 I'll
 walk
 through
 one
 of the


things
 I
 have
 found
 impactful
 especially


with
 like
 our
 newer
 products
 that
 we're


pushing
 out.
 Um
 one
 thing
 I'll
 say
 I
 I


can't
 show
 this
 but
 again
 does
 work
 with


data
 and
 getting
 better
 relationships


with
 data
 engineering.
 Um
 I
 think
 when


we've
 started
 to
 like
 unlock
 more
 and


more
 capabilities
 with
 with
 data
 on
 that


front
 as
 well.
 Uh
 like
 with
 MCP
 just


this
 week
 our
 team
 got
 to
 the
 point


where
 we're
 now
 properly
 like
 analyzing


a
 lot
 of
 feedback
 and
 actually
 creating


uh
 pages
 in
 KOD
 for
 review
 uh
 for
 things


for
 our
 team
 as
 we
 walk
 in
 based
 on
 like


new
 trends
 that
 are
 emerging
 amongst
 the


data
 uh
 automatically
 uh
 which
 is
 quite


fun.
 But
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we've


also
 done
 here
 that
 really
 helps
 is
 just


like
 making
 it
 more
 searchable
 for


folks.
 Uh
 this
 is
 really
 helpful
 for


like
 not
 even
 the
 core
 build
 team
 that's


working
 on
 the
 product,
 but
 when
 I'm


working
 with
 uh
 for
 instance
 like
 sales


or
 I'm
 working
 with
 PMM
 uh
 that
 are


supporting
 us
 with
 launches,
 they'll


often
 have
 questions
 of
 like,
 hey,
 what


feedback
 have
 we
 been
 receiving
 lately?


Or
 like
 are
 people
 doing
 this
 sort
 of


use
 case?
 Right?
 and
 they're
 just
 they


have
 very
 specific
 questions
 or
 they're


trying
 to
 understand
 something.
 Um
 or


it's
 the
 designer
 who
 as
 we're
 diving


into
 a
 topic,
 we
 want
 to
 like
 really


quickly
 surface
 uh
 times
 where
 users


have
 had
 uh
 issues
 with
 the
 like
 error


log
 system
 and
 they
 want
 to
 like
 find


like
 hey
 can
 we
 find
 that?
 And
 so


created
 like
 a
 little
 chatbot
 here
 uh


that
 essentially
 just
 like
 it's
 really


simple
 but
 it
 it
 is
 fed
 with
 a
 bunch
 of


like
 databases
 essentially
 and
 then
 just


like
 makes
 that
 really
 easily
 searchable


right
 um
 it's
 a
 standard
 chatbot
 rag


type
 thing
 I
 won't
 go
 into
 it
 um
 in
 much


detail
 but
 it's
 like
 internally
 locked


down
 for
 us
 um
 and
 all
 those
 things


which
 is
 really
 helpful
 um
 and
 and
 we


also
 use
 this
 sort
 of
 system
 externally


as
 well
 so
 like
 you'll
 And
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 we
 do
 here
 is
 I
 have
 our
 MCP


helper
 chatbot
 transcripts.
 And
 so
 I


have
 this
 kind
 of
 like
 enduserfacing


chatbot.
 And
 you'll
 see
 it
 it
 has
 these


like
 knowledge
 sources
 which
 are


basically
 just
 like
 our
 help
 docs
 as


well
 as
 one
 uh
 table
 which
 is
 like
 a


Google
 sheet
 type
 thing.
 It's
 our


sappier
 world
 of
 that.
 And
 I
 I
 love
 this


little
 system
 and
 I'll
 just
 talk
 for
 a


second.
 Uh
 and
 it's
 really
 just
 you
 know


for
 anybody
 that's
 working
 with
 data
 and


knowledge
 management
 things.
 it's


difficult
 to
 keep
 it
 up
 to
 date
 and
 I


found
 myself
 previously
 constantly
 like


trying
 to
 go
 back
 to
 our
 knowledge


sources
 that
 these
 these
 bots
 had
 and


just
 like
 trying
 to
 manually
 keep
 it
 up


to
 date
 on
 like
 a
 monthly
 or
 quarterly


basis.
 Uh
 but
 one
 system
 I
 ended
 up


finding
 that
 worked
 really
 well
 for
 me


is
 I
 built
 um
 like
 one
 there's
 a
 zap


somewhere
 that
 essentially
 every
 time


there
 is
 a
 closed
 uh
 support
 ticket
 or


if
 there's
 a
 a
 finished
 chatbot


transcript
 it
 analyzes
 the
 conversation


and
 tries
 to
 say
 like
 what
 is
 the
 core


FAQ
 from
 this
 like
 what
 was
 the
 core


issue
 what
 was
 the
 solution
 if
 any
 and


is
 that
 already
 in
 the
 knowledge
 base


that
 we
 had
 if
 not
 please
 propose
 an


entry
 and
 so
 what
 I
 then
 do
 is
 I
 have
 my


like
 human
 step
 here
 where
 I
 can


actually
 review
 the
 FAQs
 that
 it
 wants


to
 submit
 and
 all
 I
 have
 to
 do
 to
 I
 can


edit
 it
 as
 well
 like
 what
 the
 answer
 is


and
 if
 I
 approve
 it
 it
 goes
 over
 to
 a


different
 database
 which
 is
 the
 one
 that


the
 bot
 is
 actually
 using.
 Um
 so
 a


really
 nice
 way
 that
 I
 have
 found


consistently
 now
 on
 a
 number
 of
 projects


just
 to
 like
 rapidly
 iterate
 and
 keep


those
 things
 up
 to
 date
 so
 that
 users


are
 just
 getting
 like
 their
 answers


faster.
 Uh
 which
 is
 really
 nice.
 Yeah.


Well,
 what
 what
 I
 like
 about
 this
 is
 I


often
 tell
 people
 who
 are
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 use
 cases
 of
 AI
 or
 implement


AI
 solutions
 is
 they
 really
 get
 stuck
 on


like
 the
 I'm
 doing
 X.
 How
 do
 I
 use
 AI
 to


continue
 to
 do
 X
 or
 do
 X
 faster,


whatever?
 And
 that's
 fine.
 I
 think


that's
 a
 like
 I
 I
 I'm
 already
 taking


meetings.
 How
 do
 I
 make
 taking
 those


meetings
 a
 little
 easier?
 But
 the


challenge
 I
 often
 give
 people
 is
 let's


say
 you
 had
 the
 perfect
 team
 with


infinite
 time.
 What
 are
 the
 things
 your


perfect
 team
 with
 infinite
 time
 would
 do


in
 anyone's
 and
 your
 perfect
 support


team
 with
 infinite
 time
 would
 look
 at


every
 support
 question
 and
 would
 go
 see


do
 we
 have
 the
 right
 help
 desk
 content


here
 and
 if
 we
 don't
 let's
 write
 great


content
 and
 then
 let's
 publish
 it
 and


then
 let's
 put
 that
 in
 the
 chat
 like
 in


an
 ideal
 but
 none
 of
 us
 live
 in
 ideal


worlds
 we're
 super
 busy
 and
 so
 I
 think


this
 is
 like
 a
 really
 good
 example
 of


that
 where
 it
 allows
 you
 to
 operate
 at
 a


next
 level
 of
 quality,
 not
 just
 like


velocity,
 but
 a
 next
 level
 of
 quality.


And
 then
 again,
 like
 the
 more


highquality
 data
 you
 create,
 the
 more


you
 can
 power
 interesting
 AI
 solutions


to
 your
 customers
 like
 chat
 bots.
 And


so,
 um,
 you
 know,
 again,
 anybody
 out


there
 looking
 like
 if
 I
 had
 a


full-fledged
 team
 of
 SDRs
 that
 were


perfect
 and
 had
 infinite
 time,
 what


would
 I
 do?
 Or
 like,
 you
 know,
 10,000


support
 people
 with
 infinite
 time,
 what


would
 I
 do?
 like
 start
 to
 think
 about


those
 use
 cases
 and
 don't
 forget
 to
 to


pluck
 those
 off
 because
 I
 think
 they
 can


unlock
 some
 interesting
 ideas
 inside


your
 team
 and
 then
 let
 your
 team
 act
 as


higher
 leverage
 folks.
 I


>> like
 the
 way
 you
 put
 that.
 The
 the
 other


I
 don't
 know if
 it
 helps
 ever
 to


anybody,
 but
 the
 other
 way
 I
 often
 tell


folks
 that
 are
 struggling
 with
 that
 is


like
 if
 you
 could
 run
 chatbt
 in
 your


sleep,
 what
 would
 you
 do
 is
 you
 know
 I


found
 a
 really
 good
 way
 to
 help
 people


start
 brainstorming
 ideas.
 I
 will
 say
 as


like
 a
 maybe
 aside
 on
 that
 on
 the


product
 design
 world,
 uh
 we
 found
 we
 did


one
 experiment
 really
 early
 on
 um
 that


was
 kind
 of
 like
 Mad
 Libs
 to
 help


discover
 use
 cases
 and
 stuff
 and
 it
 was


a
 very
 interesting
 experiment
 in
 that
 it


seemed
 to
 actually
 help
 people
 discover


what
 they
 wanted
 to
 do
 but
 it
 also


challenged
 them
 to
 think
 through
 like


what
 their
 pain
 points
 were
 and
 it
 was


really
 fascinating
 uh
 just
 to
 to


experience.
 So,
 uh,
 for
 anybody
 looking


at
 that
 in
 their
 products,
 try
 a
 Mad


Libs
 style,
 uh,
 AI
 enabled
 system
 to


like
 ask
 questions
 and
 ask
 follow-up


questions
 with
 free
 form
 text.


>> Just
 to
 kind
 of
 take
 a
 step
 back
 and


walk
 through
 what
 you
 what
 you
 showed
 us


today,
 we
 have
 MCPs.
 Um,
 Zapier
 MCPS
 in


particular
 can
 give
 you
 a
 really
 custom


set
 of
 tools
 to
 call.
 You
 like
 Claude,


you
 like
 using
 Claude
 projects
 to
 give


instructions
 on
 tool
 calling
 sequence


and
 instructions
 so
 you
 get
 really
 high


quality
 outputs
 of
 that.
 And
 then
 you're


really
 focused
 on
 um
 I
 heard
 you
 say


very
 early
 on
 in
 the
 episode
 avoiding


things
 you
 hate
 which
 is
 like
 all
 of
 us


updating
 the
 CRM.
 Um
 you
 know
 attending


what
 we
 all
 attend
 which
 are
 just
 in


time
 meetings,
 right?
 you
 just
 get
 out


of
 the
 next
 meeting
 and
 you
 you
 show
 up


in
 the
 next
 one
 without
 context.
 So,


making
 sure
 you're
 prepped
 for
 that.
 And


then
 kind
 of
 this
 virtuous
 cycle
 of


customer
 feedback,
 support
 feedback,


FAQs,


um
 you
 know,
 internal
 input,
 and
 then


customerf
 facing
 uh
 help
 content
 as
 kind


of
 a
 a
 happy
 happy
 circle
 here.
 And
 so,


I
 think
 this
 is
 great
 for
 anybody
 who's


spending
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 with
 customers,


whether
 you're
 in
 sales
 or
 support
 or


product.
 um
 to
 be
 better
 prepared
 um
 and


and
 get
 stuff
 done
 with
 less
 tabs
 open


in
 your
 browser,
 which
 is
 what
 we
 all


want.


Well,
 uh
 Reed,
 I'm
 going
 to
 we're
 going


to
 do
 a
 couple
 lightning
 round
 questions


and
 then
 we'll
 get
 you
 out
 of
 here
 back


to
 um
 pushing
 the
 boulder
 up
 the
 hill.


My
 first
 question
 for
 you
 is
 we've
 seen


a
 lot
 of
 business
 use
 cases.
 What
 are


like
 your
 favorite
 personal
 use
 cases?


like
 what
 are
 ones
 that
 have
 really


surprised
 you
 either
 by
 making
 you
 know


really
 how
 sparking
 joy
 or
 just
 really


solving
 a
 problem
 personally?


>> Yeah,
 I'll
 touch
 on
 two
 real
 fast.


Number
 [clears throat]
 one,
 in
 terms
 of


solving
 a
 problem,
 family
 calendar


planning.
 Uh
 for
 anybody
 that
 has
 kids


and
 families,
 like
 family
 calendar,
 it's


a
 real
 thing.
 Um
 and
 for
 me,
 the


struggle
 is
 uh
 my
 my
 wife
 and
 I
 both


like
 a
 physical
 calendar
 in
 the
 house


and
 we're
 reluctant
 to
 get
 like
 a
 full


digital
 frame
 thing.
 Um,
 so
 we
 have
 a


physical
 one
 that
 we
 write
 things
 on,


but
 I
 like
 live
 by
 Google
 calendar.
 And


if
 it's
 really
 not
 my
 Google
 calendar,


it
 like
 doesn't
 exist.
 Um,
 and


particularly
 if
 it's
 a
 family
 event


that's
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 like
 a


normal
 day,
 then
 someone
 can
 book
 a


meeting
 over
 and
 that's
 really
 not
 good.


And
 so
 I
 actually
 have
 a
 claw
 project


called
 family
 calendar.
 It
 has
 really


detailed
 instructions
 on
 it's
 not
 too


detailed
 but
 it
 basically
 tells
 it
 like


which
 calendar
 to
 look
 at
 uh
 how
 to
 add


things
 if
 it's
 an
 event
 that's
 at
 my


son's
 school
 or
 somewhere
 to
 leave
 time


in
 my
 calendar
 to
 drive
 there
 and
 drive


back
 if
 it's
 you
 know
 during
 the


business
 hours.
 Uh
 so
 that
 that
 is


blocked.
 And
 now
 what
 I
 do
 is
 like


occasionally
 I
 just
 take
 a
 picture
 of


the
 physical
 calendar
 and
 then
 it
 uses


the
 various
 like
 find
 and
 update
 and


create
 actions
 for
 Google
 calendar


through
 Zapium
 MTP
 and
 just
 like
 does


all
 of
 it.
 Um
 and
 I
 love
 that.
 Um
 that's


probably
 like
 one
 of
 the
 greatest


things.
 Uh
 other
 than
 that
 these
 days
 uh


they
 had
 a
 big
 V5
 update
 recently.
 I


have
 been
 loving
 it
 with
 my
 son
 and
 his


other
 like
 friends
 in
 our
 neighborhood.


Uh
 we've
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 songs
 together.
 I


literally
 just
 like
 talked
 to
 Claude
 and


I
 was
 like,
 "Hey
 Claude,
 you're
 gonna


write
 a
 kid
 song
 for
 my
 son
 Leo.
 He's


four.
 Here's
 what
 we
 did
 today."
 And
 I


just
 like
 told
 it
 what
 we
 did.
 And
 my


son
 insisted
 that
 it
 have
 poop
 and
 fart


jokes
 in
 it
 as
 well.
 And
 so
 I
 was
 like,


"Well,
 you
 need
 to
 have
 some
 poop
 and


fart
 jokes."
 Um,
 and
 my
 son
 has
 listened


to
 this
 at
 least
 on
 Suno
 alone
 14
 times.


Uh
 we
 gave
 it
 to
 one
 of
 his
 babysitters


and
 she
 they
 listen
 to
 together
 like


non-stop
 for
 an
 hour.
 Um
 and
 we've
 done


this
 with
 like
 his
 friends
 and
 they've


made
 songs
 for
 each
 other
 and
 it's


really
 fun
 and
 it's
 the
 other
 thing
 too


is
 like
 some
 of
 the
 older
 kids
 nearby


like
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 girls
 like
 10
 almost


10
 and
 she's
 been
 learning
 about
 like


prompting
 through
 this
 because
 she
 was


like
 oh
 it
 said
 this
 but
 like
 that's
 not


right.
 I
 and
 I
 was
 like
 well
 you
 got
 to


be
 specific
 in
 this
 and
 you
 got
 to
 like


instruct
 it.
 And
 so
 I
 have
 I
 gave
 them


like
 a
 a
 whiteboard
 with
 a
 dry
 erase


marker
 and
 they're
 just
 like
 writing
 out


their
 little
 prompts.
 Um
 and
 then
 I


input
 them
 for
 them.
 Um
 and
 so
 that's


been
 a
 lot
 of
 fun
 and
 I
 think
 I
 don't


know
 hopefully
 a
 little
 bit
 educational.


>> I
 have
 to
 I
 have
 to
 just
 uh
 bring
 us


back
 to
 our
 starter
 topic
 which
 is
 does


Sunno
 have
 an
 MCP?


>> That's
 good.


>> Team
 I
 I
 am
 also
 a
 uh
 extreme
 Puno
 power


user.
 Love
 it.
 And
 imagine
 imagine
 you


could
 take
 your
 customer
 prep
 meeting


and
 just
 give
 yourself
 like
 a
 friendly


jingle
 to
 remember
 what
 they're
 talking.


>> You
 laugh.
 But
 I've
 actually
 I
 did
 that


with
 I
 took
 our
 I
 took
 our
 MCP
 sales


training
 session.
 I
 actually
 took
 the


transcript
 from
 Zoom
 along
 with
 the
 deck


and
 I
 gave
 it
 to
 Claude
 and
 I
 said
 come


up
 with
 a
 pop
 song
 I
 think
 for
 this


>> and
 I've
 actually
 shared
 it
 and
 a
 couple


of
 our
 like
 sales
 team
 and
 product
 team


have
 actually
 listened
 to
 it
 and
 really


liked
 it.
 Um
 I
 mean
 yeah
 we
 we
 teach


kids
 with
 music
 and
 humans
 have
 been
 I


don't
 know
 music
 people
 much
 longer
 than


we've
 been
 reading
 people.
 Um
 so
 it's


it's
 fun
 uh
 to
 explore
 that.
 I
 might
 I


might
 have
 you
 beat
 which
 is
 I
 took
 a


incident
 postmortem


for
 like
 an
 engineering
 incident
 and


then
 made
 it
 was
 like
 a
 punk
 song
 about


how
 we
 needed
 to
 solve
 the
 root
 cause


issues.
 Um
 and
 it
 was
 called
 Renew


theerts.
 It
 was
 it's
 a
 very
 it's
 a
 b


it's
 a
 b
 certified
 banger.
 So
 um
 we'll


have
 to
 put
 a
 playlist
 together
 and
 put


it
 in
 the
 show
 notes.
 Okay.
 And
 then


there's
 one
 last
 use
 case
 which
 I
 love.


I
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 spend
 a
 couple


minutes
 on
 it
 with
 notebook
 LM.


>> Yeah,
 this
 one
 I
 I
 think
 Notebook
 LM
 I


use
 personally
 for
 learning.
 Uh,
 I
 put


like
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 in
 it
 to
 learn,
 but


I
 got
 one
 that
 I
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 value


from,
 uh,
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 brownie
 I
 bonus


husband
 points
 from
 with
 my
 wife.
 Uh,


which
 was
 she
 was
 recently
 like
 job


searching.
 And
 what
 I
 did
 for
 her
 on
 all


of
 them
 was
 like
 when
 she
 got
 the


interview,
 I
 would
 take
 their
 like


careers
 page.
 I
 would
 take
 the
 job


thing.
 I
 would
 find
 like
 more


information.
 And
 I
 had
 like
 a
 prompt
 I


used
 for
 the
 audio
 overview
 that
 was


like,
 "You
 are
 preparing
 Anna
 for
 this


interview.
 Like
 make
 sure
 it's
 specific


to
 Anna."
 and
 she
 listened
 to
 all
 of


these
 before
 and
 she
 like
 constantly
 got


feedback
 throughout
 the
 process
 that
 she


was
 like
 the
 most
 informed
 applicant.


She
 clearly
 understood
 the
 space
 cuz
 I,


you
 know,
 would
 always
 tell
 like
 talk


about
 the
 competitors,
 what
 they're


doing
 in
 the
 marketing
 world
 and
 what


are
 trends
 going
 on
 there.
 Um,
 and
 she


loved
 that
 it
 was
 also
 like
 so
 Anna,


we're
 going
 to
 prepare
 you
 today.
 It
 was


really
 cute.
 Um,
 but
 it
 worked


exceptionally
 well
 for
 her.
 um
 she
 ended


up
 getting
 like
 the
 ideal
 job
 that
 she


really
 wanted.
 Um
 and
 yeah,
 it
 was


pretty
 awesome.
 So,
 highly
 recommend


that.
 It's
 also
 great
 bonus
 points
 for


anybody
 out
 there
 with
 friends,
 family,


interviewing,
 um
 the
 ways
 that
 you
 can


really
 help
 them.


>> Okay,
 I'm
 going
 to
 have
 to
 make
 hats,


which
 is
 like
 my
 love
 language
 is


personalized
 AI
 podcasts.
 It's
 very


good.
 It's
 very
 good.
 Husbands
 out


there,
 uh,
 wives
 out
 there,
 partners
 out


there,
 demonstrate
 your
 love
 by
 doing


knowledge
 work
 via
 AI
 for
 the
 things


that
 your
 your
 partner
 needs.
 Okay,
 this


is
 this
 is
 amazing.
 This
 is
 really
 fun.


Um,
 so
 many
 tabs
 opened
 in
 the
 sidebar.


I'm
 sure
 so
 many
 other
 things
 you
 could


show,
 Reed.
 Thanks
 for
 joining.
 Where


can
 we
 find
 you
 and
 how
 can
 we
 be


helpful?


>> Yeah,
 where
 you
 can
 find
 me,
 LinkedIn.


I'm
 most
 active
 on
 LinkedIn.
 Um,
 I
 do


love
 the
 LinkedIn.
 Uh,
 so
 you
 can
 find


me
 Reed
 Reid
 Robinson
 um
 on
 LinkedIn.


You'll
 probably
 find
 me
 pretty
 quick.


Um,
 if
 you
 can
 help,
 honestly,
 I'm
 a


sucker
 for
 product
 feedback.
 Like,
 try


some
 of
 the
 things
 I've
 talked
 about


today.
 Tell
 me
 what
 worked.
 Tell
 me
 what


didn't
 work.
 Tell
 me
 what
 you
 wish


existed.
 Um,
 I
 also
 love
 hearing
 from


the
 folks
 who
 are
 thinking
 about
 the


future
 of
 all
 of
 this.
 Um,
 who've
 tried


like
 wacky
 things
 and
 they're
 like,


"Hey,
 if
 only
 I
 could
 do
 this."
 Um,
 I'd


love
 that.
 like
 bigger
 picture
 thinking


stuff
 as
 well.
 So
 if
 you've
 got
 some


like
 wacky
 ideas
 in
 the
 world
 of
 tools


and
 agents
 and
 automation
 stuff,
 let
 me


know.
 If
 not,
 yeah,
 try
 Zap
 your
 MCP.


Give
 us
 some
 feedback.
 Would
 love
 any


and
 all.


>> Amazing.
 Well,
 thank
 you
 so
