[Speaker 2]:  hello，
[Speaker 2]:  everyone，
[Speaker 2]:  welcome to the one thousand fifteen episode of tax research insites on friday，
[Speaker 2]:  february，
[Speaker 2]:  six，
[Speaker 2]:  twenty twenty，
[Speaker 2]:  twenty six，
[Speaker 2]:  let's discuss the topic from january fifteenth min shuzi u。
[Speaker 2]:  the former head of the national housing reform task force stated in an interview that although the tal number number of four close properperties in china currently small，
[Speaker 2]:  it's severely impacts the entire market price system and financial stability，
[Speaker 2]:  easily trigging panic in the real estate market。
[Speaker 2]:  therefore，
[Speaker 2]:  mshshuyou sugested chchina should stop four closures。
[Speaker 2]:  what are your thought on maang shouse's viewpoint？
[Speaker 3]:  first，
[Speaker 3]:  let's introduce magshousuu。
[Speaker 3]:  he comes from prominent family，
[Speaker 3]:  worked in the general office of the central committee in his early thirties，
[Speaker 3]:  and began serving as the general manager of the china real state development group crag in nineteen ninenineteen，
[Speaker 3]:  ninety two later keep became determine in party secretary of cragg and the head of the national housing reform task force，
[Speaker 3]:  which was an academic positions he held after retiring from his main roles for contemporary edzines mangshuuse。
[Speaker 3]:  most famous statement was in twenty twenty twenty three when the pandemic had just standed。
[Speaker 3]:  mshouws u stated the chinese residents added fifatrillion u on in savings in twenty teen in。
[Speaker 3]:  he hehouintransactions volume decreased by five brillion you on。
[Speaker 3]:  he argued that if chinese people were willing to use one third of their savings to buy houses，
[Speaker 3]:  the chinese economy could recover smoothly。
[Speaker 3]:  i won't comment on the correctness of mshhelse you statement at the time。
[Speaker 3]:  but when mangshelse，
[Speaker 3]:  who made a statement in twenty twenty three，
[Speaker 3]:  chinese housing prices had not yet form the comprehensive doward trend，
[Speaker 3]:  and there was no consensus among ordinary people。
[Speaker 3]:  the fact that magshelwho，
[Speaker 3]:  who was able to speak out immediately to sevage the real estate market shows that he does have some insider knowledge of the real situation。
[Speaker 3]:  this time magshows，
[Speaker 3]:  who was speaking out again，
[Speaker 3]:  saying that four closures will imppact the real estate market market，
[Speaker 3]:  whether you support rising prices or falling prices，
[Speaker 3]:  you should take this year sly。
[Speaker 3]:  let me first explaplathe logigiof four closures simply put，
[Speaker 3]:  if someone cannot repay their mortgage，
[Speaker 3]:  uses their houses collateral，
[Speaker 3]:  but cannot repay the dead。
[Speaker 3]:  the house can be auced through judicial procedures after being seized by the course。
[Speaker 3]:  of course，
[Speaker 3]:  banks cannot arbitarily ooption houses their regulations regarding the starting price for the first option。
[Speaker 3]:  the court will a third party oprazal company to provide an estimate based on market prices according to the supreme people's court's regulations。
[Speaker 3]:  the starting bid for the first option can be discounted by up to thirty percent。
[Speaker 3]:  if the first option fails，
[Speaker 3]:  the court can further reduce the price and initiate the second aution。
[Speaker 3]:  the starting bid for the second option can be about twenty percent lower than the first one，
[Speaker 3]:  which is equivalent to fifty percent of the oppraise value。
[Speaker 3]:  if the house fails to sell in both options，
[Speaker 3]:  it enters red the liquidation hase，
[Speaker 3]:  where it sold directly at the starting bid price of the second opction。
[Speaker 3]:  generally，
[Speaker 3]:  there is no negotiation or further biding involved，
[Speaker 3]:  ordinary hooders might hold onto their properties if they think the pris too low，
[Speaker 3]:  but banks or other creditors have no need for housing。
[Speaker 3]:  and no emotional attachment to the properties。
[Speaker 3]:  so they almost certainly work hold on to the houses waiting for appreciation。
[Speaker 3]:  therefore，
[Speaker 3]:  they will sell the properties as soon as they acquire them，
[Speaker 3]:  and they they sell them。
[Speaker 3]:  they will reduce the price according regulations。
[Speaker 3]:  the they will。
[Speaker 3]:  the four close properties often reflects the true market valuation of the properties under current liquidity conditions。
[Speaker 3]:  and this is the impact that manin shws fears to understand the extent of the impact we can look at the twenty twenty five，
[Speaker 3]:  four，
[Speaker 3]:  four closure ata analysis report released by rulian asset platform on january twenty second。
[Speaker 3]:  first，
[Speaker 3]:  let's look at the overall data in twenty twenty five，
[Speaker 3]:  nearly one point three million properties will be listed nationwide in increase of sixteen point for one percent compared to twenty twenty four。
[Speaker 3]:  in is nineteen teen。
[Speaker 3]:  this number was less than five hundred thousand。
[Speaker 3]:  at the same time，
[Speaker 3]:  the transaction volume of four closed properties was only one hundred eighty eight thousand units，
[Speaker 3]:  less than zero percent of the total listings。
[Speaker 3]:  in other words，
[Speaker 3]:  the current discounts on four clothes properties have not yet reached true trtraction perties most most closed sed properties are not being sold。
[Speaker 3]:  this is just a general trend。
[Speaker 3]:  please read the original report tax directly。
[Speaker 3]:  the continuous increasing supply is not caused by a short tern shock，
[Speaker 3]:  but rather the result of risk accumulated gradually during the real state downturn being concentrated in the judicial disposal channel。
[Speaker 3]:  in the past two years。
[Speaker 3]:  this indicates that the four closure market is still in a stage of accelerated exposure of existing risks and has not yet shown any significant signs of supply contraction against the backdrop of a significant expansion in the scale of listings and continuous price concessions。
[Speaker 3]:  the increase in transactions after some assets enter the traitable ge ge is not mean a demic improvement in demand with limited demand。
[Speaker 3]:  and ample supply，
[Speaker 3]:  even if banks are unwilling to lose money，
[Speaker 3]:  they will inevitably have to offer more discounts。
[Speaker 3]:  please quietly read a section of mshshse。
[Speaker 3]:  you statement for me when a low price forecclosed property appears in neneighborhood，
[Speaker 3]:  the transaction price quickly becomes the new benchmark for property values in neneghborhood。
[Speaker 3]:  this means the other collateral properties are generally undervalued，
[Speaker 3]:  which could trigger more loan defaults。
[Speaker 3]:  faced with more default，
[Speaker 3]:  a new round of four closed properties entering the market will further depressed surrounding housing prices，
[Speaker 3]:  thus forming a vicious cycle of falling prices and more for closure。
[Speaker 3]:  simply put，
[Speaker 3]:  if a neighbors house is sold at a discounted price，
[Speaker 3]:  it will affect the housing prices in my neighborhood。
[Speaker 3]:  if the appraise value of all the houses in an entire neighbhood is lower than the bank loan amount，
[Speaker 3]:  it creawidespread negative equity，
[Speaker 3]:  leading to widespread defaults by homeoders，
[Speaker 3]:  who would rather give their houses away to the bank。
[Speaker 3]:  this results in even more houses entering the four closure stage，
[Speaker 3]:  creating an exponential spread of the crisis according to the report from really an asset management mangshuis concerns may become a reality ality in twenty nineteen。
[Speaker 3]:  the average transaction price of four clothes properties was basally ally ninety percent of the market price。
[Speaker 3]:  by last year。
[Speaker 3]:  the average four closed property nawiwide had be be scounted by twenty five percent to be sold，
[Speaker 3]:  the lowest in the past seven years。
[Speaker 3]:  looking at each quarter，
[Speaker 3]:  the decline is even more pronounced in the last quarter of twenty twenty four。
[Speaker 3]:  the discount on four closed properties was still eighty one percent，
[Speaker 3]:  but by the second quarter last year，
[Speaker 3]:  it had fallen to seventy six percent。
[Speaker 3]:  and in the last quarter of a perent five，
[Speaker 3]:  the price of four close properties was approximately seventy four percent of the market value。
[Speaker 3]:  banks are naturally unwilling to accept this new pricing system，
[Speaker 3]:  but they have no way to control the market and have to let the report speak for itself。
[Speaker 3]:  in the first auction last year。
[Speaker 3]:  banks were generally only willing to offer in eighty six percent discount，
[Speaker 3]:  which wasn't much of a decrease compared to twenty ninety。
[Speaker 3]:  the market clearly didn't accept the the ks offer，
[Speaker 3]:  only only eleven percent of the houses were sold at this high price by the second auction banks were eager to liquidtheir housing assets and started ted offering ty ty percent discounts。
[Speaker 3]:  ts only then were consumers willing enter ter market market。
[Speaker 3]:  the the transacrate，
[Speaker 3]:  incinced，
[Speaker 3]:  ed，
[Speaker 3]:  nearly eighteen percent，
[Speaker 3]:  a large number of consumers also choose to wait til the final liquidation stage to buy a rock bottom prices。
[Speaker 3]:  this is reflected in the data，
[Speaker 3]:  most consumers acquired properties during the concentrated liquidation stage，
[Speaker 3]:  and the number of participants in the liquidation increased by one hundred，
[Speaker 3]:  forty three percent。
[Speaker 3]:  the more serious problem is that the increasing number of housing properties were not only negatively impact housing prices，
[Speaker 3]:  neighborhoods，
[Speaker 3]:  but also back the sales of new homes，
[Speaker 3]:  completely destroying the existing real estate companies ability to survive in twenty twenty two，
[Speaker 3]:  nearly eight hundred and thousand people participted in property oceans nationwide a fifty percent increase year on year。
[Speaker 3]:  however，
[Speaker 3]:  the average number of participants prootion only increased by zero point seven nine people。
[Speaker 3]:  many people were viewing the properties，
[Speaker 3]:  but few were buying and transaction prices contincontinue to be discounted。
[Speaker 3]:  according to most people psychological expectations。
[Speaker 3]:  there is still room for housing prices to fall here。
[Speaker 3]:  i wanto defend min shouzou。
[Speaker 3]:  his suggestion to stop for closures is not about hoping the government will use administrative means to artificially maintain real estate prices。
[Speaker 3]:  anyone with even a little economic sense knows that the only ressulof that，
[Speaker 3]:  that could be a complete loss of liquidity in the housing market，
[Speaker 3]:  a sharp p decline in unofficial transaction prices and both new in second hand，
[Speaker 0]:  housing markets collapsing together mank sheluidea。
[Speaker 3]:  isn't that simplicc his real intention？
[Speaker 3]:  is that banks having made a fortune mortdlunds to now groar some social responsibility instead of rushing for couple losses，
[Speaker 3]:  dragging down ordinary oples，
[Speaker 3]:  along with the real state industry。
[Speaker 3]:  when we reduce orivisual statement，
[Speaker 3]:  the banking industry has accumulated eight trillion new want and interest income for resident for mortdloans in the past ten years。
[Speaker 3]:  now it's time to share the burden with struggling residents first for struggling families，
[Speaker 3]:  allow a certain grace period for repayment，
[Speaker 3]:  second for unemployed individuals and families with significantly reduce income，
[Speaker 3]:  suspend mpinteted and extded payments，
[Speaker 3]:  giving them two or three years of grace for assets that do need to be disposed。
[Speaker 3]:  sed banbanshould should rerered to to transer er them their their leing companies and not allow them to to the market for public option。
[Speaker 3]:  this preventing further impact on secondary market prices。
[Speaker 3]:  this temporary relief policy does not mean that borrowers don't have to repay，
[Speaker 3]:  but rather extends the repayment cycle，
[Speaker 3]:  waiting for economic recovery and acid value appreciation。
[Speaker 3]:  this is better than banks rushing to deal with non performing assets and immediately causing asid losses，
[Speaker 3]:  and it also presserves basic living standards and hope for the people quoconsidering that the vast majority of chinese people's assets or houses purchase with loans。
[Speaker 3]:  i somewhat agree with bankshouse's viewpoint。
[Speaker 3]:  however，
[Speaker 3]:  considering the performance indicators of state onbanks ks，
[Speaker 3]:  i don't believe banks vovountarily take responsibility for stabilizzing assets in twenty twenty unless the people's bank of china plans to use comhensive inflation to olevia dead chinese nominal housing prices led by four closure properties，
[Speaker 3]:  will continue to faltowards real market transaction prices。
[Speaker 3]:  if you want to know the true market value of your house，
[Speaker 3]:  it's best to heed main shelsuuse advice and carefully study this rule of four closure data analysis report。
[Speaker 3]:  next，
[Speaker 3]:  i'll briefly introduce some key figures。
[Speaker 3]:  although all four closed properties have significant discounts，
[Speaker 3]:  the liquidity of different realest state properties varies last year，
[Speaker 3]:  the average discount on residential properties with seventy six percent，
[Speaker 3]:  but the transaction rate remained at twenty one percent。
[Speaker 3]:  making them the easiest assets to sell。
[Speaker 3]:  this。
[Speaker 3]:  dad shows that chinese people are not unwilling to buy houses，
[Speaker 3]:  but simply believe that current housing prices are too high。
[Speaker 3]:  at the same time，
[Speaker 3]:  the transaction price of construction land was only discounted by twenty percent，
[Speaker 3]:  indicating that some developers are still willing to buy land and believe they can make money back。
[Speaker 3]:  however，
[Speaker 3]:  these new buildings may have higher construction standards，
[Speaker 3]:  indirectly lowering the value of existing properties。
[Speaker 3]:  even worse。
[Speaker 3]:  the transaction rate for commercial real estate is less than ten peruation。
[Speaker 3]:  most commerpest discounts in the weast real eate developers，
[Speaker 3]:  promoted commercial real state，
[Speaker 3]:  with the slogan one investment supports three generations。
[Speaker 3]:  however，
[Speaker 3]:  judging from the current situation，
[Speaker 3]:  most commercial properties haven't even supported half genandards and probably to survive due to the impact of e commerce，
[Speaker 3]:  the part's，
[Speaker 3]:  most relevant toordinary people or residential and commercial properties。
[Speaker 3]:  let's look at the situation in several cities by combining the residential data，
[Speaker 3]:  starting with first cities。
[Speaker 3]:  guguanghou had the most listed four close residential properties last year，
[Speaker 3]:  nearly ten thousand sewhile。
[Speaker 3]:  shshhahaonly had three thousand three hundred and shenjen in beijing，
[Speaker 3]:  both had around five thousand five hundred。
[Speaker 3]:  this listing data reflects the dead situation of local residents，
[Speaker 3]:  suggesting that people in guangju face greater financial pressure from a transaction price perspective，
[Speaker 3]:  shenjenen's four close properties sold at the transaction of eighty two percent，
[Speaker 3]:  with a transaction rate exceeding fifty percent。
[Speaker 3]:  this indicates a strong demand for housing in shanjen and houses are still a liquid acid，
[Speaker 3]:  at least than eighty percent discount can still yield cash coming that shenjen in guangzhou。
[Speaker 3]:  it's clear that shenjen is undououtetedly the leading central city。
[Speaker 3]:  as for beijing，
[Speaker 3]:  there are no surrounding cities that can compete with it，
[Speaker 3]:  but the housing price discounts are the steepest，
[Speaker 3]:  requiring a seventy three percent discount to complete transaction。
[Speaker 3]:  this shows that if a city realized too much on the service industry，
[Speaker 3]:  it's difficult to maintain employment and consequently，
[Speaker 3]:  housing prices during economics digntion。
[Speaker 3]:  in second year cities，
[Speaker 3]:  there are significant regional differences in transaction rates。
[Speaker 3]:  the cities with the lowest transaction rates are she on yjiwan，
[Speaker 3]:  onanghou，
[Speaker 3]:  hohod and shining all concentrated in the north west，
[Speaker 3]:  except for she on the transaction rates in other northwestern provincial capitals are only in single digits，
[Speaker 3]:  indicating that the seventy eighty percent discount is not the end point for housing prices in the northwestern region，
[Speaker 3]:  the cities of nanhang and guyong rank twenty seventh and twenty eight，
[Speaker 3]:  respectively，
[Speaker 3]:  or struggling，
[Speaker 3]:  which is expected。
[Speaker 3]:  previously，
[Speaker 3]:  they were trying to catch up with the surge and housing prices，
[Speaker 3]:  but now they are lagging behind as for hufa，
[Speaker 3]:  while it has been actually integraating into the yancy river dealta in recent years and has attracted a number of industries。
[Speaker 3]:  it's transaction rates into only ourteen percent of the seventeen percent didiscount level years trking twenty nine，
[Speaker 3]:  among thirty five seconctiar cities，
[Speaker 3]:  which is somewhat surprising，
[Speaker 3]:  perhaps people in only we expecome，
[Speaker 3]:  consider huffey their provincial capital and preferred by properties in nonjing or shanghai in thirtier cities。
[Speaker 3]:  the diffedifferentiation is even more pronounced when rows transaction rate is fifty percent similar to shanjen。
[Speaker 3]:  additionally，
[Speaker 3]:  five cities dali on chain botto mood on john and chaina have single digit transaction rates。
[Speaker 3]:  these five cities while not provincial capitals，
[Speaker 3]:  shshare o commmanity a severely undiversified industrial structure with few private enterprises，
[Speaker 3]:  for example，
[Speaker 3]:  botto mainly relize on bottle steel and rare earth resources。
[Speaker 3]:  and while launching has been trying to develop on automobile ile industry chain in recent years，
[Speaker 3]:  its economy still depends on sinal petrunching brain as for chinda tobacco o farmer，
[Speaker 3]:  there contributes to its tax revenue as new industries further concentrate in metropolitan areas，
[Speaker 3]:  cities with single industries cannot retain either capital or talent。
[Speaker 3]:  looking at commercial properties，
[Speaker 3]:  shanghai and guangzhou have transaction rates excceeding twenty percent as established major cities。
[Speaker 3]:  locals there clearly retain offline consumption habits similarly as an established major city beijing transaction。
[Speaker 3]:  ramfrom first tier cities is lower than shanghai in guangzu u。
[Speaker 3]:  shenjen's transaction rate as establish majteen percpossipossily ly duto younger population structure and their preference for online shopping in estlished cities。
[Speaker 3]:  the train action situation for commercial properties are similar to residental properties with northwestern cities and hufin。
[Speaker 3]:  the yanany riridelt，
[Speaker 3]:  a gging behind only slightly better than the situation in the northwest。
[Speaker 3]:  in thirtier cities，
[Speaker 3]:  comparing them is pointlless。
[Speaker 3]:  more than half of the cities have commercial property transaction rates below ten percent，
[Speaker 3]:  making commercial proties comcompletely stagnant。
[Speaker 3]:  only three cities have transaction rates，
[Speaker 3]:  excceetwenty percent，
[Speaker 3]:  ent jangjo，
[Speaker 3]:  jinwa and wshi wshshi 's ability to surpsed two yanci river delta cities and raisits transaction rates。
[Speaker 3]:  bethirty one percent is likely due to geographical location against the backrop of a mass migration of the entire northeast population。
[Speaker 3]:  southforard jingju connecting the north east and north china，
[Speaker 3]:  ina and cloclose to sea was able to retain a sufficient number of all sailors。
[Speaker 3]:  furthermore，
[Speaker 3]:  as mentioned earlier，
[Speaker 3]:  the transaction rate for shops in lazhou was less than two percent，
[Speaker 3]:  and there were two other cities nationwide with even worse figures。
[Speaker 3]:  it seems that ordinary commercial real estate isn't even the hardest type of property to sell parking spaces，
[Speaker 3]:  and three level shops are the assets that are truly stuck peoplele's ands ds reportwenty five，
[Speaker 3]:  a total of three hundred twenty thousand parking spaces or three level shops were listed，
[Speaker 3]:  with average transaction rate of only six point eight nine percent nationwide。
[Speaker 3]:  the report's authors didn't even bother to provide data for individual cities as everyone was equally suffering。
[Speaker 3]:  so if someone wants to buy your parking space in，
[Speaker 3]:  it's best to accept whatever they offer here。
[Speaker 3]:  i should remind yours that the ruling in report i reference does not a complete report，
[Speaker 3]:  at least my list of first second and thirtier cities doesn't include sujjo where i live to see a comprehenve analysis of four closures statistics。
[Speaker 3]:  you need to look a data from other institutions，
[Speaker 3]:  for example，
[Speaker 3]:  the report from the jongy research instituincludes data for sujjo。
[Speaker 3]:  additionally，
[Speaker 3]:  let me share another important piece of data specispecial report in the first first turturbusiness menured on january sixteen，
[Speaker 3]:  to mentioned that fifty trillion u，
[Speaker 3]:  an in fixed deposits will mature that twenty twenty twenty six at the same time because of a surplus of funds。
[Speaker 3]:  banks have little incentive to absorb deposits through reliable loan businesses。
[Speaker 3]:  some banks have stop offering five year fixed deposit services，
[Speaker 3]:  and more banks have lowered fixed deposit interest rates to one point，
[Speaker 3]:  five percent were lower，
[Speaker 3]:  leading to a situation where funds have nowhere to go。
[Speaker 3]:  when i saw this news，
[Speaker 3]:  i immediately realized that a debate from a few years ago now has a conclusion during the real estate boom。
[Speaker 3]:  a few years ago。
[Speaker 3]:  some people said that real estate was a huge reserve war，
[Speaker 3]:  they could absorb access funds。
[Speaker 3]:  others said that real estate was a huge money printing maches using the modern banking stestem crecrecrecredit money。
[Speaker 3]:  now it seems that real state is indeed of money printing machine，
[Speaker 3]:  creating astronomical amounts of currency，
[Speaker 3]:  and of course，
[Speaker 3]:  also creating astronomical amounts of debt。
[Speaker 3]:  current problem in china is that the currency and dead are held by different groups，
[Speaker 3]:  the group that cash out earearholds the currency，
[Speaker 3]:  while the group that got in late bears the debt，
[Speaker 3]:  the group that posseses wealth doesn't want to reenter the real estate market。
[Speaker 3]:  so their purchasing power is like a cage tiger，
[Speaker 3]:  unable to find a way out memeanwhile。
[Speaker 3]:  the hundreds of millions of people burden with mortages are actually in a negative equity situation。
[Speaker 3]:  the problem just hasn't been fully exposed yet，
[Speaker 3]:  because there hasn't been a matass sell off。
[Speaker 3]:  thereremmshshsu is worried that the four closure crisis will bring the problem to the foforefront。
[Speaker 3]:  thank you for watching。
[Speaker 3]:  this concludes episode ten，
[Speaker 3]:  fifteen。
