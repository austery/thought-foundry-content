I remember the stomach flutters
before my first performance review
and my first job out of college.
To say I was overeager
to perform is an understatement.
I was grinding.
I worked around the clock.
I spent hours finessing my Power Points,
took meticulous meeting notes
and never missed a deadline.
Which is why I felt completely blindsided
when I actually received my review.
My boss sent me down and told me
that I needed to work
on connecting better with my clients
and building relationships with them.
Apparently, nobody knew anything about me.
Building relationships with my clients?
That's what they cared about?
I couldn't understand when I was working
so hard to deliver quality work,
and I wish I could say I underwent
some immediate transformation
where I became some fabulous connector
and lived happily ever after.
But in truth,
I didn't really know what to do
and I fumbled for a few more years.
My clients were remote most of the time.
I wasn't working with them,
and I didn't know how to relate to them
because there were
so much younger than me.
It was years later
that I was pursuing my PhD,
and like the old saying goes,
"research is me-search."
And my initial me-search focused
on burnout and work engagement
because I knew what it was like
to experience burnout.
And what was surprising to me
was that I always assumed
that burnout was just the result
of having too much work
and feeling really depleted
from too much work.
But in fact, there's so many other
factors that can play a role,
and an important one
was community and connection.
People can be burnt out
because they feel disrespected,
unsupported and disconnected
from their colleagues.
This stood out to me.
I had always focused on work output
and things that would produce
actual revenue
and quality work for a company.
And this was conditioned
by my years of schooling,
where I was rewarded with good grades
because I put in the effort
and I worked hard.
But in truth, work is full
of real, flesh-and-bone people
who want to feel connected
and they do their best work
when they feel like they're fully engaged,
like their work truly matters
and like they're doing something
bigger than just themselves.
When the pandemic struck, as we all know,
offices around the globe closed,
and my colleagues and I started
studying this transition into remote work,
remote work-life balance,
what it was like being in this new space.
And this is where I really started
to see the effect of connections
and loneliness really
came front and center.
It was more than struggling to, you know,
the fear of getting
sick or juggling childcare.
The isolation hit deep.
People lost the casual interactions
they had when they walked in the office.
And what was interesting
is that a deeper dive into the research
showed that loneliness
had been on the rise
well before the pandemic.
According to the US Surgeon General,
nearly 50 percent of US adults
experienced loneliness pre-pandemic.
And that number continues to rise.
So at this point, my me-search shifted,
as I began to wonder
about the effects of connections,
especially in the context of work
and how that impacted people
in remote interactions,
if it stifled the way
people were able to connect.
So for my dissertation,
I focused on research, initially
spearheaded by Dr. Jane Dutton,
on high-quality connections at work.
And to understand
high-quality connections,
I want you to think back
on the last time you had a positive
connection with someone.
Doesn't matter how long it was.
Could have been a friend, colleague,
someone you met for the first time,
but you felt more open with them.
You felt like you truly cared.
You felt mutually connected.
And when you left, you felt a little
more energized and uplifted.
And it didn't necessarily
need to be a happy experience.
It could have been
about something difficult and raw,
but you felt more bound together.
That's a high-quality connection.
And I was curious
about whether having higher-quality
connections throughout the day
led to higher levels of engagement
at the end of the day.
And what I found was fascinating.
Yes, it did lead to higher
levels of engagement,
but it didn't matter how many
interactions you had
or how long you spent
in those interactions.
So if you spent your entire day
having high-quality interactions
with different people,
or just one high-quality
connection with one person,
you still tended to feel more engaged.
I was also curious about the way
that people were interacting.
I wanted to know if you needed
to be in person, face-to-face,
in order to have these deep,
meaningful connections.
Because previous researchers suggest
that you do need to be in-person
in order to have those deep connections.
So I asked people how they interacted.
Were you in person and face to face?
Were you video conferencing
with the camera on
or were you chatting through audio?
And audio could be a phone call,
it could be video conferencing
with the camera off.
And what I found was
that there was no difference
between in-person connections
and video conferencing with the camera on.
So in other words,
if we're chatting face-to-face
or if we're chatting
through video conferencing
and we can see each other,
we're able to connect in a similar way.
Only-audio interactions
produce lower-quality connections.
And third, and this was surprising
and something I wasn't even looking for,
but the final thing I found
was the effect of burnout.
People who were burnt out,
it had a tremendous effect
on whether they were even able
to engage in quality connections.
And that does make sense,
because people who are burnt out
tend to withdraw,
whereas people who are connecting,
you need to put in that effort.
So burnt out individuals had a hard time
even making those
high-quality connections.
So my research showed
that having high-quality connections
is very important for engagement.
And a recent study
from McKinsey and LeanIn.org
found that about 60 percent
of in-person workers, employees,
tended to experience connectivity,
compared to fewer than 20 percent
of remote and hybrid workers.
So how do we build these connections
in a remote environment or at all?
So here's the advice I would
have given 22-year-old me
who was fumbling to make connections.
Number one is expand, or aiming
for more expansive dialogue.
It helps you go beyond
these polite greetings
and helps you dig a bit
more beneath the surface.
And there are two ways
that you can do this.
One is to ask expansive,
open-ended questions,
and the other is to answer
questions expansively.
Asking expansive, open-ended questions
encourages the other person to open up
and share a bit more about themselves.
Think about this as if you're talking
to a child coming home from school.
If you ask them,
"How was your day?"
The response will probably be --
“Um, fine.”
If you ask them,
"What was the most exciting thing
or fun thing
or boring thing about your day,"
you're more likely to get a better answer.
So in a similar way,
when you ask your colleague,
"How was your weekend?"
You're probably not going
to get a great response.
Try something like, "What was
the highlight of your weekend?"
And then ask for more.
Probe a little deeper.
Answering questions expansively
encourages you to open up
and share more about yourself,
and give someone else the opportunity
to share more in return.
For instance, if you're on a remote call,
you're on a Zoom call
with a remote team member,
and they haphazardly ask
about our most favorite
topic, the weather.
You could just say what they're expecting,
which is, "Yeah, it's pretty cold."
Or you can answer a bit more expansively.
So, for instance, I could say, "Well,
my neighbors were making
fun of me this morning
when I was walking my dog
wearing my big puffer jacket
when it was in the mid 50s.
Is it cold by you?"
And yes, this is real,
this is me and my dog in the mid 50s.
So what that does
is that encourages them to open up
because they've now learned
a little bit more about you.
They have more insight into your life.
And now they're more open
to sharing about their own.
Number two is overlap,
or finding things in common.
As human beings,
we like to feel like we belong,
and having things in common
with one another helps us bond.
When I was younger,
I used to think that being
in the same life stage
was a prerequisite
for having things in common,
but it's just not true.
Maybe you're both cat people,
or you both love country music.
You both went gorilla trekking in Uganda,
or you're both just sick and tired
of hearing about politics on the news.
It may take some time
to uncover these commonalities,
but asking questions and using
the visual cues you have,
even if it's just through
their video screen, can help.
And you can do this in reverse,
using your background as a way
for other people to learn more about you
and find commonalities with you.
So especially if you're a remote worker,
think of your background
as a conversation starter.
You can have photos
of travel or your pets.
You could have artwork
or books that you love,
anything that could prompt
conversation and engagement.
All of these things can help people
find things in common
and help you bond.
Third, and this is one
of the most important ones,
is caring
and showing that you truly care
and that you appreciate the other person
that you're conversing with.
If you're on your phone
or scrolling through your computer,
and the other person's talking to you,
it signals that whatever is on your screen
is much more important
than your conversation with them.
On the flip side,
if you're listening
attentively, you're nodding,
you're asking questions related
to what they're asking,
what they're talking about,
you're laughing at their jokes,
you're nodding, you're taking notes,
you're fully engaging.
That signals that you
appreciate them and you care.
And these types of interactions,
they energize people.
They boost their self-esteem,
and they make them feel closer to you.
So:
expand, overlap and care.
These are three things that can help you
build stronger connections with others.
But none of them are effective
unless they are done authentically.
And this is, for most people,
the hardest part.
But just like you notice
when someone's nodding
but clearly not listening,
complimenting you
but clearly doesn't mean it,
or asking you questions
but couldn't care less about your answer,
others notice when you're doing it back.
You have to dig deep,
not just going through the motions
or thinking of it as a checklist,
but truly figuring out how to care.
Leaders have an additional responsibility.
They set the tone.
So if they signal that they don't care
about connecting with others,
their employees are likely to follow.
On the other hand,
if they expand, overlap
and care in an authentic way,
that shows that it's important
for their team members to follow as well.
Leaders that have remote team members
have an additional responsibility,
because their employees
don't have those casual chats
when they walk in the office,
or lunches where they happen
to chit chat with people.
Leaders need to have
a better pulse on their team
and be more intentional
about setting up time
for people to connect.
Yes, having video conferences
with the camera on is a great first step.
But it's not enough.
You really need to build in
time to connect.
That could mean holding a few minutes
in the beginning of meetings to chit chat
or to ask questions to learn more.
It could mean having
virtual lunches with people,
either with the leader
and other team members
or team members amongst themselves.
Employing some kind
of employee listening strategy
could help you understand
what your employees are truly feeling.
Are they burnt out?
Do they feel valued?
Do they feel heard?
Acting on those things
that you hear as a leader
helps signal that you are truly listening
and trying to implement
and act on their feedback.
Creating polls and using
your chat channels
to learn more about their sense
of humor, their personalities,
their preferences,
is a great way to use the tools
that you have to connect better.
And if possible,
having in-person meetings
from time to time
can help solidify relationships.
There are so many ways
that leaders can help their remote
team members connect,
but the core pieces are to find
the time and space to connect,
to use some kind
of employee listening strategy
so that they're gathering
and acting on continuous feedback,
and to be intentional
with your time together.
The average person spends
about a third of their life at work,
and for so many people,
work is a prolonged source
of stress and strain.
We can do better.
Let's do our part
to connect a little more,
engage a little more,
and make work truly work for us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
