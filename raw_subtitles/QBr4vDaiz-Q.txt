>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 Odd
 Thoughts
 podcast.
 I'm
 Tracy


Aloway


>> and
 I'm
 Joe
 Eisenthal.
 Joe,
 I
 love
 doing


American
 history
 episodes
 in
 part


because
 I
 feel
 like
 my
 own
 knowledge
 of


American
 history
 is
 fairly
 simplistic


and
 I
 do
 remember
 a
 huge
 culture
 shock


when
 I
 went
 from
 high
 school
 to
 college


and
 I
 think
 I
 told
 this
 story
 before.
 So


I
 went
 to
 college,
 university
 in
 London


and
 I
 had
 always
 heard
 the
 American


Revolution
 described
 as
 the
 American


Revolution,
 right?
 And
 then
 as
 soon
 as
 I


get
 to
 the
 UK,


>> I
 What
 do
 they
 call
 I
 never
 Yeah.
 What


do
 they
 call
 it?


>> Yeah,
 they
 call
 it
 I
 think
 the
 American


War
 of
 Independence,
 which
 has
 a


different
 tonality
 to
 it.


>> Definitely.


>> But
 it
 definitely
 demonstrates
 just
 how


subjective
 tensions,
 conflicts,
 and


policies
 can
 actually
 be
 in
 history


depending
 on
 who
 you're
 talking
 to.
 and


we
 are
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 not
 just
 a


pretty
 subjective
 American
 policy
 but


one
 that
 has
 been
 reinterpreted
 and


amended
 many
 many
 times
 in
 the
 past.


>> Right?
 So
 obviously
 for
 us
 this
 has
 been


a
 Venezuela
 week
 and
 there's
 all
 sorts


of
 immediate
 questions
 that
 are
 sort
 of


most
 directly
 relevant
 to
 we've
 been


talking
 about
 the
 market
 elements


mostly.
 We
 talked
 about
 oil,
 we
 talked


about
 the
 uh
 sovereign
 debt
 etc.
 But


then
 there's
 all
 these
 questions
 of


course
 about
 international
 law
 and
 what


is
 legitimate
 and
 what
 is
 illegitimate


and
 I
 mean
 I
 couldn't
 even
 believe
 the


headline
 when
 I
 saw
 it
 that
 we
 had


arrested
 I
 know
 this
 I
 I
 I
 was
 flabber
 I


just
 the
 idea
 that
 that
 we
 had
 arrested


a
 head
 of
 state
 from
 another
 country
 is


just
 absolutely
 gobsmacking
 and
 then


people
 talk
 about
 international
 law
 and


then
 they
 say
 does
 international
 law


even
 exist
 and
 so
 forth
 and
 what
 it


feels
 like
 to
 some
 extent
 truly


uncharted
 territory.
 here.


>> Yep.
 Uncharted
 territory.
 But
 people
 are


drawing
 on
 a
 parallel.


>> Yes.


>> Which
 is
 the
 Monroe
 Doctrine.


>> Yes.


>> The
 Monroe
 Doctrine
 of
 I
 think
 it
 was


1823
 I
 want
 to
 say
 basically
 said
 that


America
 would
 assert
 its
 dominance
 over


the
 entire
 American
 region.
 And
 uh
 since


then
 it's
 changed
 a
 number
 of
 times.
 But


the
 way
 it's
 being
 talked
 about
 now
 is


as


the
 Trump
 corollery
 or
 the
 Dawn
 Row


doctrine
 which
 was
 described
 in
 the


national
 security
 strategy
 document
 that


the
 Trump
 administration
 put
 out
 back
 in


December
 and
 that
 one's
 a
 little


different.
 So
 we
 keep
 seeing
 these


amendments
 to
 the
 doctrine.
 By
 the
 way,


I
 should
 just
 say,
 do
 you
 remember
 back


in
 2013,
 John
 Kerry
 explicitly
 said
 that


the
 Monroe
 doctrine
 was
 over?
 It
 was


dead.


>> I
 don't
 remember
 that.


>> And
 now
 it's
 back.
 It's
 arisen.


>> Some
 version
 of
 it
 is
 certainly
 back.


You
 know,
 it's
 very
 interesting
 because


the
 US
 clearly
 has
 a
 longstanding


history
 of
 various
 operations,


overt
 and
 covert,
 of
 involving
 itself,


shall
 we
 say,
 with
 the
 politics
 and


domestic
 affairs
 of
 our
 neighbors,


particularly
 in
 South
 and
 Central


America
 and
 so
 forth.
 I
 suppose
 any


country
 is
 naturally
 going
 to
 have
 some


security
 interest
 in
 what's
 happening,


its
 proximity.
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 itself


is
 particularly
 weird.
 I
 really
 like


this
 term,
 the
 Donroe
 doctrine,
 because


there's
 two
 things.
 There's
 this


long-standing
 history
 that
 the
 US
 wants


to
 have
 a
 role
 to
 play
 in
 everyone


else's
 politics
 among
 our
 neighbors.
 But


then
 there's
 this
 other
 element
 with


Donald
 Trump
 specifically
 where
 it
 feels


like
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 policy
 and
 principle


is
 essentially
 he's
 the
 president
 and


what's
 in
 his
 head
 and
 his
 ideas
 are


legitimate
 because
 they're
 his
 ideas
 and


he's
 the
 president.
 So
 yes,
 there's


precedents,
 there's
 norms
 and
 so
 forth,


and
 then
 there
 is
 this
 sort
 of
 novelty


that
 everyone's
 trying
 to
 read
 his
 mind.


And
 we're
 in
 this
 very,
 very
 strange


situation,
 which
 uh
 has
 come
 up
 on
 our


last
 two
 episodes
 in
 which
 you
 have
 the


president
 talking
 about
 oil
 and


>> explicitly.
 Yeah.


>> And
 yet
 people
 are
 like
 skeptical.
 It's


very
 strange.
 It's
 a
 very
 strange


situation
 because
 you
 have
 to
 like,
 oh,


he
 admitted
 it.
 It's
 about
 oil.
 And
 yet


everyone's
 like,
 is
 there
 something
 else


at
 play
 beyond
 here?
 It's
 the
 total


inversion
 for
 how
 people
 have
 talked
 in


the
 past
 about
 the
 legitimacy
 or


illegitimacy
 of
 how
 we
 involve
 ourselves


internationally.


>> That
 was
 part
 of
 the
 original
 Monroe


doctrine
 as
 well.
 There
 was
 this
 weird


tension
 between
 like
 pro-democracy,


anticolonialism,
 keep
 the
 European


powers
 out.


>> Yeah.
 and
 America
 basically
 kind
 of


creating
 its
 own
 informal
 colonies.
 That


tension
 has
 always
 been
 there
 and
 uh
 we


should
 talk
 about
 that.
 We
 should
 talk


about
 whether
 or
 not
 there
 might
 be,
 you


know,
 different
 strategies
 at
 play
 in


Venezuela,
 different
 goals.
 And
 I'm


happy
 to
 say
 we
 do
 in
 fact
 have
 the


perfect
 guest.
 We're
 going
 to
 be


speaking
 with
 Greg
 Grandon.
 He
 is
 a


professor
 of
 history
 at
 Yale
 and
 the


author
 of
 the
 new
 book
 America
 America:


A
 New
 History
 of
 the
 New
 World.
 So,


Greg,
 welcome
 to
 OddLots.
 Thanks
 so
 much


for
 coming
 on.


>> Oh,
 thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> How
 important
 has
 the
 Monroe
 Doctrine


actually
 been
 in
 the
 history
 of
 American


policy
 and
 development?


>> Well,
 it's
 certainly
 been
 influential


and
 it's
 certainly
 been
 cited
 repeatedly


over
 the
 years.
 I
 mean,
 first,
 I
 think


we
 need
 to
 back
 up
 and
 say
 exactly
 what


makes
 it
 a
 doctrine.
 Yeah.


>> It
 was
 never
 voted
 on.
 Uh,
 no
 court


ratified
 it.
 It
 didn't
 actually
 assume


the
 status
 of
 doctrine
 until
 a
 couple
 of


decades
 after
 it
 was
 pronounced
 in
 1823


when
 James
 Monroe
 was
 president
 at
 the


time.
 And
 this
 was
 around
 the
 time
 that


most
 SpanishAmerican


nations
 were
 breaking
 from
 Spain
 in


their
 successful
 wars
 of
 independence


which
 were
 much
 longer
 and
 dragged
 out


than
 the
 US
 war
 for
 independence.
 By


1823,
 it
 was
 fairly
 clear
 that
 Spain
 was


going
 to
 lose
 its
 empire.
 And
 the
 United


States
 finally
 decided
 that
 it
 was
 going


to
 issue
 a
 statement.
 And
 you
 have
 to


understand
 that
 the
 doctrine
 itself
 or


Monroe's
 statement,
 it's
 really
 just
 a


kind
 of,
 you
 know,
 four
 or
 five


non-ontiguous
 paragraphs
 in
 the
 State
 of


the
 Union
 address
 of
 6,000
 words.
 You


know,
 it's
 you
 have
 to
 kind
 of


cherrypick
 through
 the
 through
 the
 State


of
 the
 Union
 address
 to
 find
 what
 is
 the


doctrine.
 and
 it's
 hesitant.
 It's


cautious.
 The
 United
 States
 wasn't


really
 sure
 where
 it
 wanted
 to
 land
 on


on
 any
 given
 issue.
 And
 there
 were


obviously
 tensions
 and
 differences
 of


opinions
 within
 Monroe's
 cabinet.
 I


mean,
 to
 put
 it
 in
 more
 modern
 terms,


you
 had
 isolationists,
 you
 had


internationalists,
 you
 had


unilateralists.
 So
 you
 had
 different


people
 thinking
 of
 different
 ways
 on
 how


the
 United
 States
 should
 address
 and


deal
 with
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 these
 new


republics
 that
 were
 coming
 into
 being
 in


South
 America
 and
 in
 Central
 America
 and


in
 Mexico
 and
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 their


former
 colonial
 rulers
 in
 Europe.
 And
 so


it
 was
 actually
 written
 by
 John
 Quincy


Adams
 who
 was
 Monroe's
 secretary
 of


state.
 And
 as
 I
 said,
 it
 was
 inserted
 in


different
 parts.
 And
 and
 it's
 true.
 It


it
 is
 it
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 contradictory


document.
 On
 the
 one
 hand,
 it
 announces


that
 the
 United
 States
 considers
 the


independence
 of
 Latin
 America
 or
 at
 the


time
 Spanish
 America
 to
 be
 irreversible


and
 that
 it
 was
 recognizing
 a
 number
 of


states
 that
 had
 established
 effective


sovereignty
 and
 unbroken
 with
 Spain.
 and


it
 warned
 off
 Europe,
 not
 just
 Spain,


but
 any
 country
 Spain
 might
 recruit
 to


help
 them
 or
 the
 Holy
 Roman
 Empire
 or
 a


Great
 Britain
 against
 trying
 to
 conquer


or
 reconquer
 the
 Americas,
 any
 part
 of


the
 Americas.
 So
 that's
 the
 kind
 of


anti-colonial
 part
 of
 the
 doctrine
 and


again
 in
 quotation
 marks
 the
 doctrine.


Then
 other
 paragraphs
 said
 that
 the


United
 States
 and
 Spanish
 America
 being


of
 the
 Western
 Hemisphere
 shared
 certain


special
 interests
 and
 ideals
 although
 it


didn't
 specify
 what
 those
 interests
 and


ideals
 were
 but
 people
 kind
 of
 presumed


they
 meant
 the
 difference
 between


monarchy
 and
 republicanism
 but
 at
 least


there
 was
 a
 kind
 of
 gesture
 to
 a
 kind
 of


shared
 fraternity
 of
 nations
 that
 had


common
 interests.


And
 so
 that's
 another
 part
 of
 the
 Monroe


Doctrine.
 And
 then
 there
 was
 the
 part


that
 was
 referenced
 that
 it
 didn't


exactly
 grant
 the
 United
 States
 much


power
 in
 terms
 of
 policing
 the


hemisphere.
 It
 was
 a
 vague
 sentence
 that


said
 the
 United
 States
 would
 interpret


events
 that
 happened
 anywhere
 in
 the


Western
 Hemisphere
 on
 how
 they
 bear
 on


the
 quote
 peace
 and
 happiness
 of
 the


United
 States.
 It
 was
 you.
 So,
 so
 it
 was


a
 document
 that
 could
 appeal
 to
 a
 lot
 of


different
 constituencies
 within
 the


United
 States.
 Like
 Thomas
 Jefferson's


expansionism,
 this
 notion
 that,
 you


know,
 the
 new
 world
 was
 shared
 a
 certain


unity
 of
 purpose.
 John
 Quincy
 Adams
 was


a
 famous
 isolationist
 and
 unilateralist.


And
 so
 there
 was
 this
 notion
 of
 the


United
 States
 could
 act
 if
 it
 wanted,
 if


it
 saw
 a
 threat.
 And
 uh
 you
 have


somebody
 like
 Henry
 Klay
 who
 imagined
 a


kind
 of
 large
 American
 system,
 a


mercantile
 system
 in
 which
 the
 US
 would


be
 a
 great
 manufacturing
 base
 and
 Latin


America,
 Spanish
 America
 would
 supply


resources
 in
 order
 to
 rival


the
 United
 Kingdom
 and
 the
 empires
 of


Europe.
 But
 the
 point
 being,
 it
 really


wasn't
 much
 of
 anything.
 Latin
 Americans


did
 like
 it.
 I
 mean,
 they
 had
 a
 lot
 of


time
 to
 read.
 It
 was
 a
 different
 period.


There
 were
 no
 iPhones.
 you
 know,
 people


read
 closely
 and
 said,
 "Oh,
 well,
 that


that's
 an
 interesting
 paragraph."
 And


what
 they
 read
 and
 liked
 mostly
 was
 they


thought
 it
 was
 a
 they
 read
 it
 as
 a
 kind


of
 amicus
 brief
 for
 their
 own


anti-colonialism.


Spanish
 Americans
 were
 very
 much
 vocal


in
 their
 idea
 that
 the
 doctrine
 of


conquest
 was
 no
 longer
 valid.
 The


doctrine
 of
 discovery
 was
 no
 longer


valid.
 there
 was
 no
 undiscovered
 land
 in


the
 new
 world
 waiting
 for
 Europeans
 to


stumble
 upon
 and
 claim
 as
 their
 own.
 And


they
 read
 the
 Monroe
 Doctrine
 as
 largely


supporting
 that
 position,
 especially
 the


part
 that
 warned
 Europe
 against
 trying


to
 reconquer
 any
 countries
 that
 had


claimed
 their
 independence.


But
 over
 the
 years,
 it
 was
 interpreted


in
 a
 different
 way.
 politicians
 and


diplomats,
 particularly
 in
 skirmishes


with
 with
 uh
 with
 Europe,
 say
 Great


Britain,
 when
 Great
 Britain
 wanted
 to


build
 a
 canal
 through
 Central
 America.


That
 was
 around
 the
 time
 that
 those
 kind


of
 vague
 scattered
 remarks
 were
 elevated


to
 the
 level
 of
 doctrine
 and
 it
 became


the
 Monroe
 Doctrine
 or
 the
 doctrine
 of


Monroe.
 And
 from
 that
 point
 forward,
 it


was
 progressively
 incorporated
 into


something
 we
 might
 call
 customary
 law.
 I


mean,
 again,
 what
 makes
 a
 doctrine
 a


doctrine
 and
 who
 gets
 to
 enforce
 it?
 It


really
 is
 just
 a
 question
 of
 power
 goes


to
 what
 you
 were
 talking
 about
 in
 the


introduction
 about
 what
 is
 international


law
 and
 and
 and
 how
 is
 it
 enforced.
 I


mean,
 most
 countries
 have
 statements
 of


principles.
 The
 United
 States
 gets
 its


own
 doctrine.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 really
 interesting,
 isn't
 it?


Because
 like
 to
 some
 extent
 when
 I
 think


about
 American
 involvement
 it's
 like
 all


around
 the
 world
 at
 any
 time
 we
 sort
 of


feel
 the
 need
 to
 fight
 against


communists
 right
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 very


common
 thing
 and
 fight
 for
 democracies


or
 any
 country
 that
 sort
 of
 has


something
 similar
 to
 our
 way
 of


government
 or
 something
 like
 that
 we


seem
 to
 be
 on
 principle
 we
 have
 to
 be


the
 ones
 or
 we
 feel
 compelled
 to


intervene
 and
 then
 here
 is
 this


geographical
 element
 that
 seems
 very


different.
 Can
 you
 talk
 a
 little
 bit


about
 the
 intersection
 of
 the


geographical
 impulse
 to
 sort
 of
 exert


your
 influence
 uh
 among
 your
 neighbors


and
 how
 that
 intersects
 with
 this
 other


I
 don't
 know
 we
 call
 it
 principle
 a


doctrine
 etc
 where
 there
 are
 just


certain
 kinds
 of
 leaders
 that
 we
 don't


like
 and
 when
 they're
 in
 power
 we
 do


what
 we
 can
 to
 eliminate
 them.


>> Yes.
 And
 this
 goes
 to
 the
 history
 of
 the


United
 States,
 its
 relationship
 to
 its


own
 hemisphere
 and
 the
 power
 that
 it
 has


exerted
 over
 the
 Latin
 America
 and


Spanish
 America
 and
 Brazil
 and
 then
 its


efforts
 at
 times
 to
 go
 global
 to
 become


a
 more
 global
 superpower.
 There's
 been,


you
 know,
 there's
 long
 different


iterations
 of
 this
 in
 which
 the
 United


States
 kind
 of
 tries
 to
 escape
 the


boundaries
 of
 its
 hemisphere
 and
 become


a
 world
 power
 at
 different
 moments
 and


then
 and
 then
 it
 falls
 back
 to
 the


Western
 Hemisphere.
 This
 has
 happened


over
 and
 over
 again.
 It
 happened
 with


the
 Great
 Depression.
 It
 happened
 uh
 uh


in
 some
 ways
 with
 um
 you
 know
 after


Vietnam,
 the
 United
 States
 turned
 back


to
 Latin
 America.
 It
 happened
 after
 the


certainly
 after
 the
 catastrophic
 war
 on


terror.
 I
 mean
 in
 many
 ways
 what's


happening
 now
 with
 Trump
 is
 an
 example


of
 this
 this
 kind
 of
 you
 know
 uh
 Trump


is
 his
 own
 problem
 and
 a
 a
 lot
 of
 the


things
 that
 are
 wrong
 is
 is
 of
 his


doing.
 But
 he
 did
 inherit
 a
 country
 that


was
 in
 profound
 crisis
 as
 a
 result
 of


the
 catastrophic
 war
 on
 terror,
 the


financial
 crisis,
 the
 inability
 of


politicians
 to
 deal
 with
 the
 corporate


wealth
 and
 inequality
 and
 and
 so
 there


is
 a
 kind
 of
 turning
 back
 to
 Latin


America
 and
 we
 can
 get
 to
 this
 a
 little


bit
 later
 if
 you
 want,
 but
 Trump's


actions
 in
 Venezuela
 are
 a
 perfect


example
 of
 what
 happens
 when,
 you
 know,


the
 United
 States,
 you
 know,
 its
 bid
 to


go
 global
 fails
 and
 it
 has
 to
 return
 to


its
 hemisphere.
 And
 that's
 why
 the


Monroe
 Doctrine
 is
 so
 important.
 Latin


America
 is
 the
 first
 place
 in
 which
 the


United
 States
 got
 a
 sense
 of
 itself
 as


an
 overseas
 power.
 You
 know,
 was
 able
 to


project
 its
 power,
 its
 financial
 power,


its
 cultural
 power,
 its
 military
 power


beyond
 its
 own
 borders.
 And
 even
 saying


that
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 tricky
 because
 the


United
 States
 borders
 were
 always


changing.
 I
 mean,
 the
 United
 States


borders
 the
 expansive
 nature
 of
 the


United
 States
 where
 it
 actually
 took


Texas
 and
 took
 Mexico.
 So,
 it
 wasn't


just
 that
 it
 was
 dealing
 with
 Latin


America,
 it
 was
 literally
 gobbling
 up


Latin
 America
 on
 its
 way
 to
 the
 Pacific.


But
 setting
 that
 aside,
 working
 within


the
 hemisphere
 and
 learning
 how
 to
 deal


with
 other
 nations,


Latin
 America
 is
 absolutely
 central
 to


that.
 And
 that's
 one
 of the
 reasons
 why


the
 Monroe
 doctrine
 rises
 in
 importance


because
 it
 supposedly
 provides
 a
 kind
 of


guideline
 for
 that.
 Now
 over
 the
 years


the
 Monroe
 doctrine
 itself
 has
 expanded.


Presidents
 explicitly
 expanded
 over
 a


boundary
 dispute
 in
 Venezuela
 and
 Guyana


in
 which
 the
 United
 States
 was


supporting
 Venezuela
 and
 Great
 Britain


was
 supporting
 British
 Guyana.
 Grover


Cleveland
 declared
 that
 the
 Monroe


Doctrine
 granted
 the
 United
 States


absolute
 sovereignty
 over
 the
 whole


Western
 Hemisphere.
 That's
 a
 that's
 a


pretty
 big
 jump
 from,
 you
 know,
 we're


going
 to
 interpret
 any
 event
 that


happens
 somewhere
 on
 our
 peace
 and


happiness,
 our
 bears
 on
 our
 peace
 and


happiness
 to
 by
 fiat,
 our
 will
 is
 law
 in


the
 hemisphere.
 And
 then
 in
 1904


along
 similar
 lines
 Theodore
 Roosevelt


when
 he
 was
 president
 he
 expanded
 the


doctrine
 with
 his
 own
 coralary
 to
 what


he
 called
 international
 police
 power
 to


suppress
 chronic
 wrongdoing
 in
 Latin


America.
 Now
 I
 I
 must
 say
 that
 most
 of


that
 chronic
 wrongdoing
 was
 provoked
 by


US
 banks
 and
 US
 mercenaries
 and
 US
 oil


extractors
 and
 you
 know
 there's
 a
 long


history
 and
 of
 like
 forcing
 loans
 on


countries
 that
 they
 can't
 pay
 off
 and
 it


leads
 to
 all
 sorts
 of
 instability
 then


civil
 war
 and
 then
 the
 US
 government
 is


called
 in
 to
 settle
 the
 problem
 that


these
 private
 interests
 created.
 So


Roosevelt
 expands
 the
 Monroe
 Doctrine


into
 a
 kind
 of
 standing
 universal
 police


warrant
 that
 will
 allow
 the
 United


States
 act
 whenever
 it
 will
 and
 whenever


it
 wants.


So,
 didn't
 FDR
 also
 reinterpret
 it,
 but


it
 didn't
 last
 long.
 Another
 Roosevelt


reinterpretation?


>> No,
 not
 really.
 But
 FDR
 actually


reversed
 course
 180
 degrees.
 And
 in


1933,
 he


>> he
 renounced
 the
 right
 of
 the
 United


States
 to
 intervene.
 There's


long-standing
 demands
 by
 Latin
 American


jurists
 and
 politicians
 and
 diplomats
 to


give
 up
 the
 right
 of
 conquest.
 I
 mean


the
 United
 States
 continued
 to
 hold
 on


to
 the
 right
 of
 conquest
 throughout
 the


19th
 century.
 It
 basically
 justified
 the


war
 with
 Mexico,
 Indian
 removal.
 The


right
 of
 conquest
 was
 taught
 in
 US


textbooks
 up
 until
 the
 1920s.
 Latin


America
 had
 revoked
 the
 right
 of


conquest
 with
 its
 independence
 because


SpanishAmerican
 nations
 came
 into
 the


world
 together
 already
 a
 league
 of


nations.
 Seven
 nations
 that
 had
 to
 learn


to
 live
 with
 each
 other
 on
 a
 crowded


continent.
 The
 United
 States
 came
 into


being
 a
 single
 nation
 on
 the
 eastern


coast
 of
 a
 great
 landmass
 that
 it


imagined
 as
 empty.
 Obviously,
 it
 wasn't


empty.
 There
 was
 Native
 Americans,
 there


was
 Mexican,
 there
 was
 Spaniards,
 but


the
 United
 States,
 there
 was
 no
 doubt


that
 the
 United
 States
 was
 going
 to


reach
 the
 Pacific
 and
 it
 held
 on
 and


used
 the
 doctrine
 of
 conquest
 in
 order


to
 justify
 taking
 all
 of
 that
 land.


Latin
 America
 was
 constantly
 trying
 to


force
 the
 United
 States
 to
 accept
 that


the
 doctrine
 of
 conquest
 was
 abregated,


was
 void.
 And
 it
 wasn't
 until
 1933
 that


it
 did.
 And
 it
 was
 Roosevelt
 who
 did


that.
 And
 he
 he
 recognized
 the
 absolute


sovereignty
 of
 Latin
 American
 nations.


And
 he
 gave
 up
 the
 right
 of


intervention.
 And
 that
 was
 an
 enormous


turnaround
 in
 US
 power.
 It
 didn't
 weaken


US
 power
 by
 any
 means.
 It
 actually


strengthened
 it
 because
 it
 focused
 it.


It
 taught
 the
 United
 States
 how
 to


exercise
 power
 more
 efficiently
 and
 it


and
 it
 organized
 Latin
 America.
 It
 was


10
 years
 of
 goodwill
 that
 really
 got


Latin
 America
 kind
 of
 on
 board
 for
 the


coming
 war
 against
 fascism.
 There
 was
 a


lot
 of
 fear
 among
 strategists
 within
 the


Franklin
 Roosevelt
 administration
 that


all
 of
 Latin
 America
 could
 have
 gone
 the


way
 of
 Spain.
 I
 mean
 a
 lot
 of
 the


sociological
 variables
 that
 led
 to
 the


rise
 of
 fascism
 or
 philangism
 in
 Spain


were
 present
 in
 Latin
 America.
 There
 was


uh
 large
 group
 of
 surviile
 peasants,
 a


small
 group
 of
 land
 owners,
 patrician


conservative
 Catholics,
 an
 increasingly


militant
 unions
 and
 peasants
 threatening


the
 power
 of
 the
 landed
 class.
 you
 know


that
 was
 Spain
 but
 it
 was
 also
 Latin


America
 writ
 large
 and
 if
 Latin
 America


fell
 to
 philanism
 then
 you
 know
 United


States
 would
 be
 kind
 of
 cornered
 between


Nazism,
 fascism
 and
 philangism.


Roosevelt's
 conceding
 to
 Latin
 America's


demand
 to
 give
 up
 the
 right
 to


intervention
 basically
 tilted
 the


playing
 field
 to
 the
 left
 in
 Latin


America.
 You
 know
 Roosevelt
 tolerated


economic
 nationalists.
 He
 let


revolutionaries
 in
 Mexico
 nationalize


Standard
 Oil
 and
 and
 appropriate
 massive


amounts
 of
 US-owned
 property
 and
 it


created
 enormous
 goodwill
 and
 and
 and


set
 the
 stage
 for
 the
 United
 States's


entrance
 into
 World
 War
 II
 from
 a


position
 of
 strength
 and
 continental


unity.


>> So
 you
 mentioned
 okay
 at
 various
 times


the
 jurists
 in
 Latin
 America
 they
 push


back
 against
 this
 notion
 of
 American


absolute
 sovereignty
 and
 these
 fights.


This
 gets
 to
 a
 question.
 I
 see
 it


debated
 on
 Twitter
 a
 lot.
 What
 do
 you


say
 to
 someone
 who
 says
 international


law
 doesn't
 exist?
 What
 is
 international


law
 doesn't
 exist?
 And
 how
 is
 this
 term


useful
 or
 not
 useful?


>> Well,
 I'm
 an
 historian.
 I'm
 not
 a
 I'm


not
 a
 lawyer
 or
 a
 jurist.
 So,
 I
 tend
 to


see
 things
 in
 terms
 of
 power
 relations.


So
 I
 think
 I
 see
 law
 as
 a
 moral
 venue


that
 is
 created
 that
 creates
 a
 set
 of


normative
 principles
 in
 which
 people
 can


fight
 over.
 So
 you
 know
 obviously
 the


international
 law
 doesn't
 exist
 in
 some


void
 in
 which
 absolute
 justice
 is
 is


going
 to
 happen.
 You
 know,
 the
 most


powerful
 country
 decides
 the
 exception.


And
 you
 know,
 the
 United
 States
 to
 the


degree
 that
 countries
 like
 the
 United


States
 submit
 to
 a
 system
 of


international
 law,
 it
 usually
 was
 during


moments
 of
 weakness
 like
 when
 Roosevelt


did
 it
 in
 1933
 at
 the
 height
 of
 the


Great
 Depression
 and
 and
 with
 fascism
 on


the
 rise.
 But
 it
 does
 create
 these
 norms


and
 these
 principles
 that
 people
 fight


and
 argue
 over
 and
 so
 yes
 and
 the


liberal
 international
 law
 order
 that
 has


supposedly
 governed
 the
 world
 since
 the


creation
 of
 the
 United
 Nations
 in
 1945.


the
 hypocrisies
 and
 the
 variances
 and


the
 exceptions
 are
 many
 and
 there's


always
 workarounds
 and
 and
 the
 United


States
 and
 and
 the
 Soviet
 Union


certainly
 found
 ways
 to
 skirt,
 you
 know,


any
 kind
 of
 limits
 that
 were
 placed
 on


them
 by
 international
 law.
 But
 it
 does


kind
 of
 create
 a
 venue,
 right,
 a
 moral


arena
 in
 which
 right
 and
 wrong
 could
 be


understood
 and
 argued
 over.
 You
 know


there's
 very
 other
 very
 little
 recourse


for
 poor
 and
 weak
 nations
 to
 defend


themselves.
 I
 mean
 we
 can
 go
 back
 to


ducidities
 right
 the
 strong
 do
 what
 they


will
 and
 the
 weak
 suffer
 what
 they
 must


and
 the
 conceit
 that
 there
 is
 such
 a


thing
 as
 international
 law
 that
 is


somehow
 transcendent
 of
 power
 relations


is
 you
 know
 it
 might
 just
 be
 a
 conceit


but
 it's
 still
 at
 least
 creates
 terms
 on


which
 nations
 could
 deal
 with
 each
 other


and
 and
 you
 know
 and
 and
 again
 Latin


America
 and
 the
 United
 States
 is


absolutely
 a
 perfect
 example
 of
 that
 for


Latin
 America's
 commitment
 to


sovereignty


and
 to
 cooperative
 relations
 was
 largely


forged
 in
 relationship
 to
 living
 under


what
 was
 becoming
 the
 most
 powerful


nation
 in
 world
 history
 as
 it
 moved


across
 the
 Pacific
 as
 it
 took
 Texas,
 as


it
 took
 Mexico,
 as
 it
 took
 Cuba,
 as
 it


took
 Puerto
 Rico,
 as
 it
 took
 Panama,
 you


know.
 So
 you
 had
 these
 jurists
 like


writing
 law
 books
 and
 coming
 up
 with


these
 legal
 principles.
 And
 the
 way
 they


get
 implemented
 though
 often
 is
 really


about
 power.
 So
 you
 know
 Argentine
 legal


theorists
 for
 instance
 Luis
 Drago
 for


instance
 at
 the
 early
 20th
 century
 when


Italian
 and
 British
 and
 German
 warboats


were
 showing
 up
 at
 Venezuela
 trying
 to


collect
 debt.
 debt
 that
 had
 gone
 back
 to


the
 colony
 that
 European
 banks
 were


claiming
 that
 Venezuela
 owed
 because
 the


Spanish
 crown,
 you
 know,
 contracted


loans
 in
 1776
 and
 whenever
 whenever
 they


did,
 Luis
 Drago
 issued
 a
 principle,
 the


Drago
 doctrine
 that
 you
 cannot
 use


coercion
 to
 collect
 debt.
 Now,
 the


United
 States
 collected
 plenty
 of
 debt


through
 coercion.
 And
 we
 could
 we
 could


look
 at
 Donald
 Trump
 and
 what's
 going
 on


in
 Venezuela
 right
 now.
 But
 the
 United


States
 kind
 of
 liked
 the
 Drago
 doctrine


because
 they
 didn't
 want
 Italian
 and


German
 and
 British
 warships
 flitting


around
 the
 Caribbean
 bombing
 the
 coast


of
 Colombia
 or
 or
 Venezuela
 trying
 to


seize
 hold
 of
 the
 customhouse
 to
 get
 the


receipts.
 They
 thought
 that
 okay,
 so


we'll
 support
 the
 Drago
 doctrine.
 This


this
 will
 give
 us
 a
 leverage
 in
 keeping


Europe
 out
 of
 our
 backyard.
 So
 you
 you


kind
 of
 see
 the
 back
 and
 forth
 between


law
 as
 a
 kind
 of
 moral
 principle
 that


transcends
 social
 power,
 but
 then
 it's,


you
 know,
 it's
 obviously
 subordinated


and
 implemented
 through
 social
 power.


What's
 your
 sense
 of
 the
 actual
 goals


behind
 the
 Venezuela
 move?
 Because
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 national
 security


strategy
 document,
 they
 talk
 about
 the


US
 reasserting
 its
 preeeminence
 in
 the


Western
 Hemisphere.
 And
 I
 don't
 know
 how


you
 measure
 preeeminence,
 right?
 That


seems
 a
 pretty
 broad
 term.
 Meanwhile,


Trump
 has
 talked
 very
 explicitly
 about


Venezuelan
 oil
 belonging
 to
 the
 US.


There's
 no
 regime
 change
 on
 the
 horizon.


They're
 not
 pressing
 for
 that.
 So,
 what


is
 the
 ultimate
 goal
 of
 all
 of
 this?


What
 are
 they
 aiming
 for?


>> Well,
 you
 know,
 it's
 hard
 to
 say.
 As
 I


said
 earlier,
 Trump
 is
 doing
 what
 a


number
 of
 his
 predecessors
 have
 done


during
 moments
 of
 of
 US
 kind
 of


recession
 of
 US
 power
 in
 the
 world.
 They


turn
 back
 to
 Latin
 America.
 But
 in
 some


ways
 it's
 pure
 Trumpism,
 right?
 It's


just
 this
 theatrical
 spectacle.


You
 know,
 he
 said
 it
 was
 about
 oil.


Well,
 first
 it
 was
 about
 immigration,


then
 it
 was
 about
 gangs,
 then
 it
 was


about
 fentanyl
 and
 drugs,
 and
 then
 he


then
 he
 landed
 on
 oil,
 getting
 our
 oil


back.
 Oil
 is
 trading
 at
 an
 all-time
 low.


Maybe
 not
 an
 all-time
 low,
 but
 it's


pretty
 low.
 The
 market
 is
 filled


fluttered
 with
 oil
 and
 to
 get
 Venezuela


back
 online
 is
 going
 to
 cost
 an
 enormous


amount
 of
 capital
 investment
 and
 there's


not
 a
 lot
 of
 oil
 companies
 that
 are


rushing.
 They're
 going
 to
 rush
 into


Venezuela
 then
 do
 that.
 You
 know,
 I


think
 Trump
 there
 was
 just
 playing
 to


his
 base.
 I
 think
 he
 was
 he
 was,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 his
 base
 likes
 the
 idea
 of


Trump
 as
 a
 pirate,
 Trump
 as
 a
 colonial


plunderer,
 you
 know,
 and
 and
 yeah,
 yeah,


we'll
 get
 our
 oil
 back.
 You
 know,
 just


like
 with
 the
 Iraq
 war
 in
 2003,
 there's


always
 ways
 to
 get
 oil,
 right?
 There's


many
 ways
 to
 get
 oil.
 Like,
 you
 don't


have
 to
 start
 a
 a
 global
 war
 on
 terror


in
 order
 to
 secure
 Iraqi
 oil.
 You
 could


have
 just,
 you
 know,
 made
 a
 deal
 with


Saddam
 Hussein
 and
 got
 the
 oil.
 You


could
 have
 did
 the
 same
 thing
 with,
 you


know,
 so
 material
 interests
 are
 always


understood
 through
 a
 prism
 of
 ideology.


And
 so,
 part
 of
 it
 was
 that
 Venezuela


has
 been
 in
 crisis
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 I


mean,
 that's
 a
 whole
 another
 story
 for
 a


whole
 another
 show.
 And
 you
 know,
 a


hedgeimon
 like
 the
 United
 States
 can't


have
 that
 kind
 of
 crisis.
 I
 mean,


millions
 of
 Venezuelans
 were
 fleeing
 the


country.
 I
 mean,
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 be


carrying
 water
 for
 Trump's
 nivism
 and


his
 border
 policies
 at
 all
 to
 say
 that


that
 kind
 of
 disruption
 and
 that
 kind
 of


chaos
 can't
 go
 on
 forever
 in
 a
 regional


hegeimon's
 hinterland.
 And
 so,
 you
 have


to
 kind
 of
 do
 something.
 The
 question


is,
 what
 are
 you
 going
 to
 do?
 And
 Trump


seems
 to
 like
 these
 targeted
 attacks,


right?
 Whether
 they're
 in
 Iran,
 whether


in
 the
 in
 Nigeria,
 you
 know,
 these


oneanddone
 attacks.
 And
 I
 think
 he
 was


sold
 on
 the
 idea
 that,
 you
 know,
 if
 they


just
 took
 out
 Maduro
 and
 left
 the
 Maduro


state
 intact,
 because
 it
 is
 very
 much


ingrained
 and
 embedded
 in
 Venezuelan


society.
 I
 think
 there
 were
 a
 couple
 of


intelligent
 people
 in
 Marco
 Rubio's


State
 Department
 that
 didn't
 want
 to
 see


a
 repeat
 of
 2003
 with
 what
 happened


after
 debatification


in
 Iraq,
 the
 complete
 chaos.
 So
 Trump


was
 convinced
 that
 you,
 you
 know,
 you
 do


this
 one
 and
 done
 thing
 and
 then
 you


just
 kind
 of
 continue
 to
 threaten
 the


country
 in
 order
 to
 it
 it
 corresponds
 to


his
 way
 of
 being.
 There's
 no
 morality.


There's
 no
 normative
 sense.
 There's
 no


idealism.
 You
 know,
 normally
 when


presidents
 turn
 back
 to
 Latin
 America
 to


kind
 of
 regroup
 or
 rebalance
 after


global
 crisis,
 they
 kind
 of
 come
 up
 with


new
 kind
 of
 world
 views
 to
 widen
 their


electoral
 base
 to
 deepen
 their
 coalition


to,
 you
 know,
 they
 try
 to
 create
 a
 sense


of
 hijgemony.
 Right?
 So
 you
 had
 FDR


using
 Latin
 America
 to
 put
 forth
 a
 kind


of
 social
 democratic
 continental
 New


Deal
 and
 Reagan
 after
 Vietnam
 a
 kind
 of


muscular
 anti-communist
 liberalism
 but


understood
 in
 moral
 terms
 a
 kind
 of


reassertion
 of
 American
 purpose
 American


sets
 of
 itself
 as
 a
 defender
 of
 world


freedom
 you
 know
 and
 and
 these
 become


kind
 of
 governing
 ideologies
 that
 are


durable
 able
 they
 last.
 I
 mean,
 the
 New


Deal
 coalition
 lasted
 for
 decades
 up


until
 the
 1970s.
 Reaganism
 lasted,
 you


know,
 at least
 until
 Barack
 Obama,
 if


not
 if
 not
 even
 even
 further
 in
 terms
 of


the
 world
 view.
 I
 mean,
 Trump
 isn't
 even


trying
 to
 cobble
 together
 a
 new
 world


view,
 right?
 Trump
 isn't
 coming
 up
 with


any
 kind
 of,
 you
 know,
 it's
 he's
 not


doing
 it
 for
 freedom.
 He's
 not
 doing
 it


for
 individual
 rights.
 He's
 not
 he's


certainly
 not
 doing
 it
 for
 social


democracy,
 you
 know,
 he's
 demanding


tribute,
 right?
 He's
 just
 trying
 to
 turn


Venezuela
 into
 a
 vassal
 state.
 But
 I


think
 that
 speaks
 to
 the
 moral
 emptiness


of
 him
 and
 his
 and
 and
 his
 political


movement.
 And
 Reagan
 and
 FDR
 presided


over
 majoritarian
 movements,
 right?
 They


won
 overwhelmingly
 at
 the
 electoral.
 You


know,
 Trump
 pretty
 much
 is
 running
 a


minority
 movement
 that
 is
 only
 in
 power


because
 of
 the
 anti-majoritarian


political
 structure
 of
 the
 United
 States


and
 Trump's
 dominance
 of
 the
 Republican


party.
 So,
 he
 doesn't
 seem
 interested
 at


all
 in
 turning
 Trumpism
 into
 a
 governing


coalition.
 He
 just
 wants
 to
 continue
 to


stoke
 the
 culture
 wars,
 continue
 to,
 you


know,
 stoke
 the
 grievances
 of
 tribal


nationalism
 of
 the
 American
 firsters
 and


hence
 the
 Monroe
 Doctrine.
 You
 know,
 to


bring
 it
 back
 to
 the
 Monroe
 Doctrine,


the
 Monroe
 Doctrine
 and
 American
 First


Nationalism,
 there
 was
 always
 a
 strong


kind
 of
 correlation
 between
 the
 two.


American
 first
 nationalists,
 right?
 Even


the
 the
 pre-Trump
 ones,
 the
 ones
 from


the
 1920s
 and
 leading
 up
 into
 World
 War


II,
 they
 liked
 the
 Monroe
 Doctrine


because
 it
 wasn't
 universalist.
 It


wasn't
 international
 law.
 It
 was


customary
 law
 specifically
 related
 to
 US


power
 within
 its
 hemisphere.
 And
 so
 the


Monroe
 Doctrine,
 it
 makes
 sense
 that


Trump
 as
 the
 standard
 bearer
 of
 today's


iteration
 of
 America
 first
 nationalism


would
 latch
 on
 to
 the
 Monroe
 Doctrine
 as


a
 kind
 of
 substitute
 for
 liberal


internationalism.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 this
 is


maybe
 the
 most
 fascinating
 element
 of


all
 the
 complete
 lack
 of
 pretense


really,
 right?
 And
 obviously
 you


mentioned
 at
 various
 times
 international


policy
 has
 had
 some
 storyline.
 We
 all


know
 what
 the
 story
 we
 were
 going
 to


turn
 Iraq
 into
 a
 democracy
 and
 then
 that


would
 spread
 throughout
 the
 Middle
 East


and
 then
 there
 would
 be
 other


democracies
 and
 then
 be
 rich
 and
 be


stable
 etc.
 There's
 some
 story.
 I
 think


that
 is
 so
 striking
 about
 Trumpism
 or
 at


least
 this
 particular
 move
 really
 just


sort
 of
 the
 complete
 lack
 of
 like
 a


broader
 story.
 You
 mentioned
 also
 of


course
 which
 I
 think
 is
 um
 notable
 about


Trump
 foreign
 policy
 this
 appeal
 of


these
 sort
 of
 oneandone
 things
 because


okay
 there
 seems
 to
 be
 post
 Iraq
 this


sort
 of
 national
 backlash
 towards
 or


certainly
 post
 Afghanistan
 this
 backlash


towards
 boots
 on
 the
 ground
 long
 wars


forever
 wars
 etc.
 But
 there
 also
 does


seem
 to
 be
 this
 impulse
 of
 just,
 yeah,


but
 we
 still
 want
 to
 do
 something


powerful.
 We
 still
 want
 to
 show
 that


we're
 tough.
 And
 so
 then
 the
 way
 that


they
 solve
 the
 problem
 is
 by
 these


one-offs.
 We're
 going
 to
 do
 a
 one


bombing
 run
 in
 Iran.
 We're
 going
 to


arrest
 a
 foreign
 leader.
 Is
 there
 any


precedent
 for
 that
 or
 is
 this
 truly
 like


sort
 of
 feel
 uncharted
 territory
 when


you
 think
 about
 these
 arcs
 of
 uh
 foreign


policy?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Well,
 in
 Latin
 America,


there
 are
 two
 precedents.
 One
 is


obviously
 Manuel
 Noriega
 in
 1989
 when


George
 HW
 Bush
 sent
 about
 30,000
 Marines


in
 to
 capture
 Noriega
 on
 a
 on
 a
 warrant


basically
 to
 arrest
 him.
 It
 was


considered
 a
 police
 action
 and
 and


that's
 how
 it
 was
 legally
 justified.


Noriega
 was
 an
 ally
 of
 the
 United


States.
 He
 was
 a
 CIA
 asset
 in
 the
 1980s.


He
 was
 very
 much
 involved
 in
 the


complexities
 of
 Iran
 Contra,
 but
 he


played
 all
 sides
 against
 the
 other.
 I


think
 he
 was
 selling
 information
 and


intelligence
 to
 Cuba.
 He
 was
 also


working
 with
 Mossad.
 And
 when
 the
 cold


war
 ended
 and
 the
 Berlin
 wall
 fell,
 his


usefulness
 had
 largely
 come
 to
 an
 end


and
 the
 United
 States
 decided
 that
 they


were
 going
 to
 take
 him
 out.
 There
 was
 a


Saiy
 report
 in
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 that


detailed
 his
 deep
 involvement
 in
 drug


running
 and
 and
 it
 couldn't
 be
 ignored


anymore.
 And
 so
 they
 went
 in
 and
 they


arrested
 him.
 So
 that's
 one
 president.
 A


lesser
 discussed
 one
 is
 in
 Haiti
 in


2005.
 Jean
 Petron
 Adersteed
 was


president
 of
 Haiti
 and
 there
 was
 a


USbacked
 coup
 but
 it
 was
 one
 of
 these


coups
 that
 were
 kind
 of
 carried
 out
 by


democracy
 promotion
 organizations
 that


were
 funded
 by
 aid
 and
 the
 National


Endowment
 for
 Democracy
 that


destabilized
 the
 country
 to
 the
 point


where
 Irish
 couldn't
 govern
 and
 George


W.
 Bush
 sent
 Marines
 in
 and
 basically


put
 a
 gun
 to
 his
 head
 and
 and and
 flew


him
 to
 the
 Congo
 where
 he
 still
 lives


now
 where
 is
 in
 exile.
 So
 So
 it's


happened
 before.
 I
 think
 what
 is


unprecedented
 is
 this
 idea
 that
 we
 are


just
 going
 to
 accept
 oil
 tribute
 from


Venezuela
 that
 we're
 just
 going
 to
 give


these
 directives
 to
 the
 Venezuelan


government
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 send
 I


mean
 I
 mean
 we
 talk
 about
 international


law.
 All
 of
 this
 stuff
 is
 just


unilateral
 US
 projections
 of
 its
 power.


I
 mean,
 the
 United
 States
 placed


sanctions
 on
 Venezuela.
 That's
 not


international
 law.
 I
 mean,
 news
 the


papers
 talk
 about
 it
 as,
 you
 know,


Venezuela
 is
 trying
 to
 violate
 sanctions


by
 finding
 workarounds
 to
 sell
 its
 oil.


It's
 like,
 why
 not?
 It's
 their
 oil.
 It's


the
 United
 States
 just
 putting
 the


sanctions
 on
 just
 because
 it's
 not
 like


it's
 not
 like
 the
 nations
 of
 the
 world


voted
 on
 putting
 sanctions
 on
 Venezuela.


But
 in
 any
 case,
 I
 think
 what
 is


unprecedented
 is
 what
 they're
 working


out
 and
 they
 seem
 to
 be
 working
 it
 out


on
 a
 as
 you
 go
 basis.
 It
 doesn't
 seem


like
 they
 have
 a
 clear
 plan.
 You're


right.
 They
 don't
 want
 it
 to
 be
 2003


Iraq.
 They
 don't
 want
 boots
 on
 the


ground.
 They
 know
 the
 rank
 and
 file
 of


Trump.
 It
 has
 a
 very
 low
 tolerance
 for


for
 casualties
 and
 and
 fatalities
 and


America
 first
 nationalism
 doesn't


doesn't
 want
 to
 be
 involved
 in
 nation


building.
 But
 what
 you're
 seeing
 is,
 I


think,
 two
 distinct
 trajectories.
 On
 the


one
 hand,
 they're
 imagining
 some
 system


in
 which
 that
 Venezuela
 just
 continues


to
 kind
 of
 pay
 a
 tribute
 to
 the
 United


States
 through
 oil.
 But
 then
 when
 Marco


Rubio
 talks
 about
 it,
 he
 says,
 well,
 we


have
 these
 different
 phases
 of


reconstruction
 and
 transition
 to


democracy
 planned
 out
 in
 Venezuela.
 So


that
 kind
 of
 suggests
 more
 of
 a
 direct


role
 in
 pushing
 the
 country
 in
 a
 certain


direction
 politically,
 not
 just
 leaving


it
 as
 it
 is
 as
 long
 as
 it
 continues
 to


send
 the
 ships,
 you
 know,
 just
 like


during
 colonial
 times.
 I
 mean,
 the


colony
 sent
 the
 ships
 filled
 with
 gold


to
 Spain.
 Now
 they're
 sending
 the
 ships


filled
 with
 oil
 to
 Port
 Arthur,
 Texas.


>> All
 right,
 Greg,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to


leave
 it
 there,
 but
 thank
 you
 so
 much


for
 coming
 on
 All
 Thoughts.
 That
 was


fantastic.
 Really
 appreciate
 it.


>> Thanks.
 Thanks
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me.


Joe,
 that
 was
 absolutely
 fascinating.


The
 point
 that
 stood
 out
 to
 me
 was
 this


idea
 of
 going
 into
 your
 own
 backyard
 to


assert
 your
 dominance
 as
 a
 sort
 of


replacement
 or
 offset
 to
 a
 decline
 of


multilateralism
 elsewhere
 in
 the
 world.


Like
 that
 kind
 of
 makes
 sense.


>> And
 it's
 very
 interesting
 that
 there's


this
 pattern,
 this
 historical
 pattern
 in


the
 United
 States
 that
 essentially
 Latin


America
 is
 where
 we
 go
 to
 dominate
 when


we're
 internally
 weak.
 And
 of
 course,
 I


think
 people
 would
 agree
 that
 the
 US
 is


feeling
 particularly
 weak
 on
 a
 number
 of


angles.
 There's
 obviously
 the
 sort
 of


existential
 threat,
 anxiety
 about
 the


rise
 of
 China,
 etc.
 So
 maybe
 it's
 this


kind
 of
 thing.
 Okay,
 we
 are
 not
 going
 to


be
 at
 least
 for
 the
 moment
 the
 global


power
 that
 we
 once
 were,
 etc.
 But
 in
 the


absence
 of
 that,
 at least
 we
 can
 still


establish
 that
 we
 get
 to
 decide
 who
 the


president
 of
 various
 Latin
 American


states
 are,


>> right?
 Latin
 American
 dominant
 power.


>> By
 the
 way,
 have
 you
 seen
 the
 Marco


Rubio
 meme
 where
 he's
 like
 covered
 in


all
 these
 different
 flags
 from
 Latin


America


>> basically
 responsible
 for
 everything?
 I


know
 I
 have
 seen
 the
 memes
 about
 the


various
 jobs
 that
 Marco
 Rubio
 is
 sort
 of


de
 facto
 having
 to
 play
 on
 this.
 Rubio


strikes
 me
 as
 like
 a
 sort
 of
 interesting


bridge
 figure
 between
 the
 sort
 of


because
 you
 know
 I
 think
 of
 him
 as
 sort


of
 being
 like
 a
 sort
 of
 retro
 like
 cold


warrior
 type
 and
 someone
 who
 does


probably
 have
 like
 believes
 like
 oh


we're
 going
 to
 like
 spread
 democracy


throughout
 the
 world
 and
 wants
 to
 see


Latin
 America
 sort
 of
 be
 you
 know
 run
 by


liberal
 democrats,
 capitalist
 countries


and
 so
 forth.
 But
 obviously
 he's
 in
 an


administration
 that
 does
 not
 have
 the


same
 impulse
 for
 that.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,


to
 some
 extent
 it
 feels
 like
 this


operation,
 it's
 like
 it's
 like
 they're


gonna
 like
 split
 the
 difference,
 right?


So,
 he
 gets
 to
 be
 involved
 in
 taking
 out


a
 Latin
 American
 leader,
 which
 he
 finds


to
 be
 hostile,
 but
 the
 idea
 that
 like
 it


does
 not
 feel
 like
 this
 administration


is
 going
 to
 have
 much
 follow
 through
 in


terms
 of,
 okay,
 now
 we
 really
 want
 to


set
 Venezuela
 on
 a
 new
 political
 course,


>> right?
 I
 mean,
 I
 guess
 we'll
 see


ultimately
 what
 they
 prioritize
 there.


But
 in
 the
 meantime,
 shall
 we
 leave
 it


there?


>> Let's
 leave
 it
 there.
