What's
 nice
 about
 baking
 is
 that
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day,
 like
 you
 still
 have
 a


cookie.
 Like,
 you
 know,
 like
 not
 being


afraid
 of
 making
 a
 mistake
 is
 going
 to


like
 free
 you
 up
 so
 much
 mentally
 in
 the


kitchen.


[music]


>> I'm
 Christine
 Sir
 Cleette.
 I'm
 Kyra


Blackwell.
 I'm
 Rosie
 Garin.
 And
 you're


listening
 to
 the
 Wire
 Cutter
 Show.


[music]


>> [music]


>> Guys,
 today
 we're
 talking
 about
 cookies.


>> Oh
 my
 god.


>> Not
 just
 cookies,
 but
 the
 book
 Cookies,


which
 is
 the
 new
 book
 from
 Von
 Breland,


who
 is
 part
 of
 the
 New
 York
 Times


cooking
 team.


>> I'm
 really
 excited
 to
 talk
 to
 Van.
 He
 is


charming,
 he
 is
 skilled,
 and
 he
 has
 a


ton
 of
 great
 recommendations
 for
 holiday


baking.
 He
 is
 the
 host
 of
 Bake
 Time,


which
 is
 a
 video
 series
 for
 New
 York


Times
 cooking.


>> It's
 also
 the
 name
 of
 a
 newsletter
 that


he
 started.


>> Yeah,
 they
 they
 just
 came
 out
 with
 that


in
 October.
 I
 subscribed.
 It's
 great.


And
 he's
 got
 like
 practical
 but
 also


aspirational
 advice
 on
 how
 to
 make


cookies.
 And
 he
 wrapped
 it
 all
 up
 in
 his


new
 book,
 which
 came
 out
 in
 October.
 And


I'm
 so
 excited
 because
 it's
 all
 ramping


up
 for
 cookie
 week
 at
 the
 New
 York
 Times


cooking.


>> It's
 a
 big
 It's
 a
 big
 part
 of
 the
 year.


One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we
 did
 that's
 fun


in
 [music]
 this
 episode
 is
 we
 asked
 to


hear
 from
 our
 listeners.
 So,
 we're
 gonna


see
 if
 he
 can
 answer
 some
 questions


about
 cookies.


>> Yep.
 [music]
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 take
 a


quick
 break
 and
 then
 when
 we're
 back,


we'll
 be
 with
 Von
 Breland
 and
 hopefully


we'll
 get
 everything
 you
 need
 to
 know


about
 baking
 great
 [music]
 cookies.


Stick
 around.


>> [music]


>> Welcome
 back.
 Our
 guest
 today
 is
 the


cookie
 man,
 Von
 Vland.
 Van
 is
 the
 host


of
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 cooking
 YouTube


series
 and
 newsletter
 called
 Bake
 Time,


and
 he
 has
 a
 new
 book
 out
 appropriately


called
 Cookies.
 The
 book
 is
 a
 love


letter
 to
 cookie
 baking.
 It
 is
 full
 of


recipes
 for
 every
 occasion.
 Many
 of


which
 van
 developed,
 plus
 with
 many


contributions
 from
 his
 colleagues
 at


Times
 Cooking,
 including
 Eric
 Kim's
 goji


chang
 caramel
 cookies,
 Ywanda
 Kamalafes


spiced
 chocolate
 marble
 shortbread,
 and


Sola
 Elley's
 white
 chocolate
 macadamia


nut
 cookies.
 Von,
 so
 happy
 to
 have
 you


here.
 Welcome.


>> Hi.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me.
 I'm


so
 excited.


>> So,
 we
 are
 catching
 you
 actually
 mid


cookie
 week.
 For
 those
 who
 are
 not


familiar
 with
 Cookie
 Week,
 this
 is
 a
 New


York
 Times
 cooking
 annual
 tradition


where
 they
 publish
 a
 bunch
 of
 really


awesome
 holiday
 cookie
 recipes.
 There's


supporting
 videos
 and
 all
 this
 awesome


stuff.
 Van,
 can
 you
 tell
 us
 a
 little
 bit


about
 cookie
 week
 and
 what
 we
 can
 expect


this
 year?


>> Oh,
 it's
 good.
 It's
 [laughter]
 really


good.
 So,
 we
 convene
 in
 like
 May
 and


we're
 like,
 okay,
 so
 how
 do
 we
 not


necessarily
 one
 up
 ourselves,
 but
 how
 do


we
 keep
 like
 pushing
 the
 form
 a
 little


bit?
 Imagine
 you
 guys
 trying
 to
 like


reinvent
 the
 cookie
 wheel
 and
 see
 like
 a


TV
 show
 about
 this.
 [laughter]


>> No,
 it's
 like
 it's
 like
 we
 convene
 and


we
 get
 pitches
 from
 all
 the
 developers


and
 then
 we
 like
 put
 them
 literally
 up


onto
 like
 a
 board
 and
 then
 we
 mix
 and


match
 from
 the
 different
 pitches
 to
 see


like,
 okay,
 so
 she
 pitched
 a
 fruity
 one,


he
 pitched
 a
 nutty
 one,
 they
 pitched


like
 a
 chocolatey
 one.
 How
 did
 these
 all


look
 together
 in
 a
 cookie
 box?


>> Oh,
 that's
 awesome.
 I
 like
 that.


>> It's
 fun.
 It's
 a
 lot
 of
 mixing
 and


matching.
 And


>> so
 this
 year
 I'm
 really
 excited
 because


the
 theme
 is
 but
 make
 it
 a
 cookie.


>> So
 like
 my
 first
 recipe
 I
 ever
 worked
 on


for
 New
 York
 Times
 cooking
 was
 an
 eggnog


snicker
 doodle


>> and
 it
 is
 based
 off
 of
 the
 beverage
 and


then
 I
 kind
 of
 took
 that
 and
 ran
 with
 it


the
 other
 cookie
 week.
 So,
 I
 did
 like
 a


Mexican
 hot
 chocolate
 cookie,
 a


gingerbread
 latte
 cookie,
 and
 they
 were


popular
 because
 I
 think
 people
 resonate


with
 those
 flavor
 profiles,
 and
 then


they're
 like,
 "How
 does
 that
 translate


into
 a
 cookie?"
 Right.


>> And
 it's
 super
 festive.


>> It's
 festive.
 Yes.
 So,
 this
 year,


everybody's
 like,
 "Well,
 why
 don't
 we


just
 do
 like
 a
 riff
 on
 that
 and
 have


everybody
 pitch
 but
 make
 it
 a
 cookie?"


>> So,
 people
 were
 thinking
 about
 like


their
 favorite
 cocktails
 as
 cookies.


There's
 a
 mortadella
 cookie,
 which
 goes


actually
 probably
 one
 of
 my
 favorite


ones.


>> It's
 like
 a
 sausage.


>> Yeah.
 [laughter]
 It


>> is
 that
 the
 with
 pistachio?


>> Uh
 yeah.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 got
 pistachio.
 It's
 really


creative
 and
 fun.
 It's
 like
 a
 almond


cookie
 like
 a
 slice
 and
 bake
 that
 gets


its
 pink
 hue
 like
 the
 mortadella
 like


soft
 pink
 from
 freeze-dried


strawberries.


>> And
 then
 there's
 pistachios
 and


macadamia
 nuts
 for
 those
 like
 little


specks
 of
 fat
 that
 you
 would
 see.
 It


looks
 just
 like
 it
 is
 a
 little
 trippy.


Yeah,
 it's
 fun.


>> We
 put
 out
 a
 call
 to
 our
 listeners
 to


send
 us
 their
 toughest
 questions
 around


cookie
 baking
 and
 so
 we
 want
 you
 to
 help


diagnose
 their
 various
 baking
 issues.


So,
 are
 you
 game
 to
 answer
 some


questions?


>> Oh,
 yeah,
 totally.


>> All
 right,
 let's
 go.


>> Hi,
 wire
 cutter.
 My
 name
 is
 Poppy
 and


I'm
 from
 New
 York
 City,
 but
 I'm


currently
 living
 in
 the
 DMV.
 My
 cookie


question
 is,
 when
 baking
 cookies,
 does


it
 make
 a
 difference
 if
 you
 use
 a


silicone
 pad
 or
 parchment
 paper
 on
 a


baking
 sheet?
 Does
 one
 add
 more
 of
 a


crispy
 texture?
 Thanks.
 Bye.


>> Oh,
 this
 is
 a
 good
 question.
 I
 feel
 like


I've
 had
 this
 question.
 Shout
 out
 to
 the


DMV.


>> Like,
 oh
 [laughter]
 my
 god,
 Poppy,
 I


love
 you.
 Um,
 that
 is
 a
 a
 really
 good


question.
 I
 still
 test
 recipes
 on
 both


silicone
 baking
 mats
 and
 parchment
 paper


to
 make
 sure
 that
 it
 bakes
 the
 same.


Okay.
 Sometimes
 it
 will
 bake


differently.
 Silicone
 it
 will
 absorb


more
 of
 the
 heat
 on
 a
 metal
 baking
 tray.


So
 parchment
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a


little
 bit
 less
 hindrance.
 It's
 more
 of


like
 a
 you'll
 have
 like
 more
 metal


conduction
 underneath
 it.


>> So
 does
 it
 make
 it
 crisper
 with
 the


parchment
 and
 browner?


>> You
 know,
 in
 my
 oven
 yes
 it
 does.
 In
 my


oven,
 things
 tend
 to
 cook
 a
 little
 bit


faster
 on
 parchment
 paper.
 Now,
 the


people
 like
 baking
 on
 silicone
 because


all
 you
 got
 to
 do
 is
 wash
 it
 off.
 It


also
 will
 create,
 for
 me
 at least,
 more


consistent
 results.
 But
 parchment,
 I


think,
 is
 more
 of
 the
 route
 that
 we
 go


with
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 cookie
 recipes


because
 it's
 more
 like
 readily
 available


at
 the
 grocery
 store.
 And
 it's
 usually


going
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 easier
 to
 lift


the
 cookie
 off
 of
 the
 parchment
 quicker.


>> But
 yeah,
 I
 mean,
 still,
 that's
 a


question
 that
 I
 still
 like
 test
 recipes


to
 make
 sure
 that
 it
 works
 the
 same
 on


both.
 If
 there
 is
 a
 discrepancy
 in
 them,


it's
 worth
 noting,
 but
 usually
 it's


about
 the
 same.


>> Okay,
 that's
 great.
 So,
 Poppy's
 question


is
 a
 really
 good
 segue
 into
 talking
 a


little
 bit
 more
 about
 gear.
 What
 are


your
 essential
 cookie
 baking
 tools
 in


the
 kitchen?
 What
 do
 you
 think
 if
 people


are
 really
 wanting
 to
 bake
 this
 holiday


season,
 what
 do
 they
 really,
 really
 need


to
 have?


>> You
 have
 to
 have
 a
 good
 strong
 spatula.


>> What
 shape?
 I
 like
 the
 kind
 of
 spoonulas


because
 they
 what
 like
 they
 call
 it
 a


spoonula
 because
 it's
 got
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 divot
 like
 a
 spoon,
 but
 it's
 also
 a


silicone
 spatula.
 For
 me,
 that's
 like


the
 easiest
 of
 getting
 into,
 you
 know,


if
 you're
 with
 a
 stand
 mixer
 or
 even


with
 a
 hand
 mixer
 and
 a
 bowl,
 scraping


down
 the
 sides
 is
 very
 key.
 Like


especially
 after
 creaming
 the
 butter
 and


the
 sugar.
 To
 me,
 that's
 also
 something


that
 kind
 of
 goes
 back
 to
 Poppy's


question
 of
 like
 consistency.
 I


experience
 much
 more
 consistent
 bakes
 if


I
 take
 the
 time
 to
 actually
 go
 through


the
 steps
 as
 intended.
 Like,


>> you
 write
 about
 that
 in
 the
 book.
 Read


the
 recipe
 from
 top
 to
 bottom.


>> Absolutely.
 Read
 the
 recipe
 from
 top
 to


bottom
 and
 you
 run
 less
 of
 a
 risk,
 less


of
 a
 margin
 for
 error.
 But
 yeah,
 I
 would


say
 a
 silicone
 spatula,
 a
 spoonula.
 I


would
 say
 I
 like
 OXO
 cookie
 scoops.
 I


think
 that
 OXO
 cookie
 scoops
 are
 they're


the
 ones
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 developers


test
 with.
 But
 the
 thing
 that's
 really


frustrating
 about
 cookie
 scoops
 is
 from


brand
 to
 brand
 they're
 all
 different


sizes.


>> OXO
 makes
 a
 2
 oz
 cookie
 scoop,
 for


example.
 And
 that
 doesn't
 necessarily


always
 correspond
 with
 the
 same
 size
 as


like
 the
 restaurant
 supply
 store
 ones.


So
 definitely
 make
 sure
 that
 when
 you're


using
 a
 cookie
 scoop,
 I
 like
 to
 fill
 it


with
 water
 and
 put
 it
 in
 like
 a
 shot


glass
 to
 see
 how
 many
 ounces
 it
 actually


is.


>> And
 2
 ounces
 is
 what
 you
 would


recommend.


>> I
 use
 Well,
 I
 it
 depends
 on
 for
 my


chocolate
 chip
 cookies,
 I
 use
 a
 2
 oz


scoop,
 which
 is
 going
 to
 be
 four


tablespoons.
 And
 then
 a
 1
 oz
 scoop
 is
 2


tablespoons.
 So
 for
 a
 smaller
 drop


cookie,
 my
 cookie
 for
 cookie
 week
 this


year
 is
 the
 1
 oz
 scoop.
 And
 just
 to
 be


clear,
 a
 cookie
 scoop
 is
 kind
 of
 like
 It


looks
 like
 an
 ice
 cream
 scoop,
 but
 it


has
 a
 little
 thing
 that
 you
 push
 with


your
 thumb
 to
 eject
 the
 cookie
 dough.


>> Exactly.
 Yeah.
 It's
 got
 a
 release


mechanism.


>> Yes.
 [laughter]
 Right.
 Right.
 Like
 for


Mission
 Impossible
 cooking.


>> Yes.
 I
 mean,
 and
 depending
 on
 the
 dough,


like
 I
 have
 worked
 with
 dough
 before


that
 was
 too
 cold
 and
 sometimes
 the


cookie
 scoop
 snaps.
 So,
 I
 think
 that
 the


OXO
 ones
 are
 traditionally
 the
 most


durable.
 The
 OXO
 ones
 I've
 had
 for
 like


eight
 years.
 also,
 you
 know,
 be
 set
 up


for
 success,
 whether
 you're
 baking
 on


parchment
 or
 your
 silicone
 baking
 mats.


I
 like
 to
 have
 everything
 laid
 out
 for


me
 [snorts]
 before
 I
 start
 baking


because
 there's
 nothing
 worse
 than


having
 like
 dough
 all
 over
 your
 hands


and
 everything's
 greasy
 and
 then
 you
 got


to
 go
 like
 into
 the
 drawer
 and
 find
 the


plastic
 wrap.
 Everything
 gets
 all


buttery.
 When
 you
 have
 a
 nice
 misison


plus
 that
 is
 very
 comforting
 when
 you
 go


into
 the
 baking
 process
 and
 also
 makes


you
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 confident.
 Another


thing
 I
 think
 that


everybody
 should
 own
 a
 kitchen
 scale.


Even
 if
 you're
 a
 casual
 baker,
 even
 if


you're
 baking
 curious,
 I
 think
 that
 you


should
 own
 a
 kitchen
 scale.
 Go
 into
 your


kitchen
 and
 measure
 out
 a
 cup
 of
 flour


in
 your
 cup.
 First
 of
 all,
 I
 have
 like


four
 different
 brands
 of
 cup
 measures


and
 they
 all
 are
 different
 for
 some


reason.
 And
 when
 I
 scoop,
 even
 if
 I'm


like
 delicately
 scooping
 the
 flour
 out


of
 my
 container,
 I
 will
 scoop
 probably


145
 g
 for
 one
 cup
 of
 flour,
 our
 cup
 is


126
 g
 for
 our
 recipes.


>> Definitely
 a
 kitchen
 scale.
 And
 they


just
 make
 such
 quick
 work
 of
 everything.


We
 recommend
 the
 Escali.
 Mine
 is
 Escali.


Yeah,
 I
 think
 that's
 like
 a
 really


common
 one
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people


recommend.
 It's
 cheap.
 It's
 like
 under


30
 bucks.


>> It's
 under
 30
 bucks.
 And
 my
 friend
 Sue


used
 to
 work
 at
 11
 Madison
 Park
 and
 that


was
 the
 one
 that
 she
 had
 when
 she
 worked


there.


>> What
 about
 a
 baking
 sheet?


>> Oh
 yeah.
 You
 know,
 um,
 rimmed
 baking


sheet
 for
 sure.
 And


>> because
 that's
 what
 we
 test
 all
 of
 our


recipes
 on.
 My
 mom
 has
 this.
 I
 guess
 it


would
 be
 considered
 what
 they
 maybe
 call


a
 cookie
 sheet,
 which
 is
 like
 the
 ones


without
 the
 rim.
 And


>> yeah,
 my
 grandma
 has
 those
 and
 she


swears
 by
 them,


>> you
 know.
 To
 me,
 they're
 like
 flimsier.


They
 don't
 conduct
 the
 heat
 as
 well.
 And


like
 I
 always
 burn
 stuff
 on
 them.
 I


think
 just
 any
 like
 rimmed
 baking
 sheet


that
 if
 you
 knock
 on
 it,
 it
 should
 sound


>> denser,


>> right?
 And
 it
 should
 sound
 like
 wobb


like
 it's
 wobbling


[laughter]
 like
 those
 sheets
 of
 like


thunder
 with
 in
 the
 movies.
 Yeah,
 it


shouldn't
 sound
 like
 that.
 No,


[laughter]
 it
 should
 sound
 like
 you're


like
 knocking
 on
 something
 a
 little
 bit


a
 little
 bit
 heftier.


>> What
 are
 some
 of
 the
 nice
 to
 have
 pieces


of
 gear
 that
 you
 think
 would
 will
 just


make
 cookie
 baking
 easier
 and
 more


pleasurable?


>> I
 love
 an
 offset
 spatula.
 I
 use
 it
 for


basically
 everything.
 If
 you
 think
 about


a
 spatula,
 it's
 like
 the
 handle
 and
 then


the
 metal
 part
 goes
 straight
 out
 from


it.
 This
 one
 has
 like
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


dip
 before
 the
 spatula
 part.
 So
 it
 it
 is


on
 two
 planes.
 You've
 got
 the
 handle
 on


one
 plane
 and
 the
 actual
 spatula
 part
 on


another.


>> Spongebob.


>> Yes,
 it
 is
 like
 that.
 And
 they're
 long


and
 skinny
 and
 so
 that's
 nice.
 People


use
 it
 for
 baking
 cakes
 and
 things
 like


that
 for
 smoothing
 stuff
 out.
 I
 like
 to


use
 them
 actually
 like
 the
 small
 offset


for
 like
 peeking
 under
 the
 cookie
 when


I'm
 taking
 it
 out
 of
 the
 oven
 to
 make


sure
 that
 the
 bottom
 it's
 a
 very


delicate
 way
 of
 doing
 it
 without
 using
 a


big
 fish
 spatula
 or
 something
 like
 that


and
 like
 running
 the
 risk
 of
 breaking


your
 cookie
 before
 it
 sets.


>> What
 about
 a
 cooling
 rack?


>> I
 was
 going to
 say
 a
 cooling
 rack
 that


fits
 in
 the
 sheet
 tray.


>> I'm
 so
 sorry
 you
 guys
 can
 tell
 that
 I


don't
 bake.
 What's
 a
 cooling
 rack?


>> It's
 a
 w
 It's
 a
 wire
 rack
 that's
 a
 grid.


And
 so
 like
 usually
 you
 want
 your


cookies
 to
 set
 up
 for
 a
 couple
 minutes


before
 you
 transfer
 them
 because
 the


residual
 heat
 that's
 still
 on
 the
 baking


sheet
 will
 still
 like
 kind
 of
 cook
 them.


Yeah.
 So
 putting
 a
 cooling
 rack
 I
 like


to
 have
 ones
 that
 fit
 in
 my
 sheet
 tray


because
 they
 won't
 wobble
 around
 as


much.
 I
 have
 knocked
 cooling
 racks
 of


cookies
 off
 of
 the
 counter
 and
 it
 is
 not


very
 fun.
 I
 like
 that.
 And
 then
 you
 know


what
 is
 my
 favorite
 thing
 that
 is
 like


such
 an
 extra
 thing
 to
 have
 but
 it
 is


makes
 your
 cookies
 very
 beautiful.
 And


you
 can
 do
 this
 with
 like
 a
 low
 ball


glass
 too
 but
 ring
 molds.


>> Oh.


>> So
 ring
 molds
 are
 actually
 really
 fun


for
 getting
 that
 like
 Instagram
 perfect


circular
 cookie.
 When
 a
 cookie
 comes
 out


and
 it's
 like
 shaped
 like
 an
 amoeba,
 you


know,
 [laughter]
 and
 you're
 like,
 "Okay,


wait.
 This
 isn't
 very
 circular."
 Well,


talking
 about
 it's
 still
 warm
 and
 still


kind
 of
 malleable
 when
 it's
 on
 the
 sheet


tray.
 So
 you
 take
 the
 ring
 mold
 or
 like


a
 low
 ball
 glass
 and
 you
 put
 it
 over
 it.


The
 circumference
 has
 to
 be
 wider
 than


the
 actual
 cookie
 and
 then
 you
 just
 do


concentric
 circles
 really
 fast
 and
 it


makes
 a
 very
 perfect
 circular
 cookie.


That's
 what
 all
 of
 our
 food
 stylists
 do.


>> That
 is
 such
 a
 hack.
 That
 is
 a
 hack.


>> I
 am
 doing
 that.
 I'm
 going
 to
 impress
 my


my
 family.


>> You
 can
 buy
 like
 the
 ring
 molds
 on


Amazon.
 The
 nice
 thing
 about
 those
 too


is
 they
 come
 in
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


sizes.
 So
 they
 start
 at
 probably
 like
 a


1
 inch
 diameter
 and
 go
 out
 to
 like


probably
 a
 6
 inch
 diameter.
 And
 then


another
 cookie
 tip,
 if
 we're
 talking


cookie
 tips
 of
 making
 them
 like
 really


picture
 perfect
 is
 especially
 like
 a


chocolate
 chip
 cookie,
 reserve
 some


chunks
 of
 chocolate
 and
 then
 press
 those


into
 the
 top
 before
 you
 bake
 them.
 And


then
 that
 will
 create
 those
 like
 really


beautiful
 puddles
 of
 chocolate
 on
 top


>> while
 it's
 still
 dough.


>> While
 it's
 still
 dough
 and
 then
 it
 bakes


into
 it
 perfectly.
 Always
 wondered
 how


you
 how
 they
 get
 those.


>> Yeah,
 cuz
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 times,
 you
 know,


when
 you
 scoop
 it,
 you'll
 get
 dough
 on


the
 the
 mounded
 side
 and
 you
 won't
 see


the
 chocolate
 on
 the
 inside.
 Still
 going


to
 taste
 great,
 but
 it's
 not
 going
 to


have
 those
 like
 we
 call
 them
 puddles
 of


chocolate.


>> I
 love
 that.
 [laughter]
 Oh,
 I
 am
 loving


that.
 That's
 great.
 So,
 are
 there
 any


pieces
 of
 gear
 that
 you
 think
 people


think
 they
 need
 to
 have
 to
 make
 great


cookies,
 but
 you're
 kind
 of
 like,
 you


don't
 need
 that?
 M
 you
 know
 I
 I
 didn't


have
 a
 stand
 mixer
 for
 a
 long
 time
 when


I
 moved
 up
 to
 New
 York
 and
 I
 like
 was


still
 able
 to
 very
 adequately
 make


cookies
 and
 so
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 need


it.
 I
 will
 say
 like
 a
 hand
 mixer
 makes


really
 nice
 work
 of
 stuff
 though.
 Like


what
 are
 some
 things
 that
 people


>> extra
 special
 butter?


>> If
 butter
 is
 like
 in
 the
 title
 of


something
 like
 brown
 butter,
 you


probably
 do
 want
 to
 splurge
 if
 you're


able
 to,
 of
 course,


>> because
 brown
 butter,
 it
 gets
 its
 flavor


from
 the
 milk
 solids
 browning.
 The


higher
 quality
 or
 the
 higher
 fat
 butter


is
 going
 to
 have
 more
 milk
 solids
 to


brown,
 so
 it
 will
 taste
 more
 nutty


typically.
 We
 have
 a
 listener
 question


actually
 that's
 specifically
 about


butter
 that
 I'd
 love
 to
 toss
 and
 get


your
 thoughts
 on.


>> Hi,
 this
 is
 Jacqueline
 from
 Salt
 Lake


City,
 Utah.
 My
 question
 is
 about
 brown


butter.
 My
 sister
 has
 a
 chocolate
 chip


cookie
 recipe
 with
 brown
 butter
 and
 it's


phenomenal
 and
 now
 I
 want
 to
 try
 brown


butter
 in
 all
 of
 my
 cookies.
 Is
 this
 a


good
 approach?
 Is
 it
 advised
 for
 some


types
 of
 cookies
 but
 not
 others?
 Any


tips
 on
 brown
 butter
 and
 cookies
 would


be
 great.
 Thank
 you.


>> I
 love
 this
 question.
 I
 love
 this


question
 because
 when
 I
 was
 first
 making


brown
 butter
 cookies,
 I
 also
 wanted
 to


put
 brown
 butter
 in
 everything.
 Like


[laughter]
 I
 literally
 was
 like,
 "Oh
 my


god,
 this
 is
 so
 good."
 Um,
 but
 you
 can't


just
 simply
 swap
 brown
 butter
 for
 butter


in
 a
 recipe.
 You
 have
 to
 think
 about


what
 is
 happening
 to
 butter
 when
 you're


browning
 it
 and
 think
 about
 what
 you're


losing.
 You're
 losing
 water.
 You're


losing
 a
 big
 portion
 of
 the
 moisture


content
 that's
 actually
 in
 that
 butter


because
 that's
 what's
 being
 driven
 off


before
 it
 can
 then
 brown.


>> And
 so
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it,
 melt


butter,
 pour
 it
 into
 like
 a
 Pyrex,
 and


you'll
 see
 that,
 you
 know,
 if
 you're


doing
 two
 sticks
 of
 butter,
 that's
 a
 cup


of
 butter.
 So
 it'll
 go
 to
 the
 cup
 line.


But
 if
 you
 brown
 two
 sticks
 of
 butter,


you're
 going
 to
 probably
 lose
 close
 to


a/4
 cup
 of
 moisture
 that's
 in
 there.
 So,


you
 know,
 I
 always,
 if
 I'm
 browning


butter,
 like
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the


volume
 measurement
 lines
 up
 and
 I'll


pour
 it
 into
 like
 a
 glass
 measuring
 cup


and
 then
 I'll
 usually
 add
 an
 ice
 cube


cuz
 that
 also
 just
 stops
 the
 cooking.


You
 could
 add
 bourbon
 to
 it,
 you
 know,


which
 would
 make
 it
 like
 any
 kind
 of


like,
 you
 [laughter]
 know,
 anything


that's
 like
 going
 to
 add
 that
 moisture


back
 in
 there.
 I
 actually
 did
 a
 test


with
 our
 very
 popular
 Jacqu
 Torres


chocolate
 chip
 cookie
 and
 I
 browned
 the


butter
 without
 putting
 an
 ice
 cube
 in
 it


and
 just
 continued
 with
 the
 recipe
 as


written
 and
 it
 was
 just
 very
 dry.
 You


know,
 you
 need
 that
 extra
 bit
 of


moisture
 back
 in
 there.
 And
 you
 know,
 I


think
 in
 terms
 of
 flavor,
 you
 do
 you.


And
 again,
 also
 if
 you're
 thinking
 about


brown
 butter,
 it's
 liquid
 when
 it's
 hot.


look
 at
 the
 recipe
 and
 if
 the
 recipe
 is


calling
 for
 softened
 butter,
 you're


going
 to
 want
 to
 take
 the
 time
 to
 like


resolidify
 that
 brown
 butter
 before
 you


actually
 continue
 what
 the
 recipe
 is


written.


[music]


Van,
 what
 I'm
 hearing
 so
 far
 is
 you


really
 don't
 have
 to
 get
 too
 complicated


[music]
 to
 make
 great
 cookies.
 You
 can


keep
 it
 very
 simple.
 You
 just
 need
 a
 few


tools.
 You
 need
 to
 have
 [music]
 your


spatula,
 maybe
 a
 spula,
 a
 good
 baking


sheet,
 parchment
 or
 silicone
 mat,
 and


then
 the
 sort
 of
 nice
 to
 haves
 are
 a


cooling
 rack,
 a
 hand
 mixer
 or
 a
 stand


mixer,
 and
 those
 ring
 molds,
 which
 I'm


very
 [music]
 intrigued
 by
 those.
 I
 want


to
 try
 those.
 And
 then
 do
 not
 go
 off


script
 with
 the
 brown
 butter.
 If
 the


[music]
 recipe
 doesn't
 call
 for
 brown


butter,
 just
 don't
 assume
 that
 you
 can


do
 brown
 butter
 instead.
 Um,
 you're


going
 to
 have
 to
 factor
 in
 the
 loss


[music]
 of
 liquid
 in
 that.


>> Absolutely.
 And
 I
 think
 what
 what's
 nice


about
 baking
 is
 that
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 like
 you
 still
 have
 a
 cookie,
 like


you
 know,
 like
 it
 might
 not
 be
 the
 most


perfect
 thing,
 not
 being
 afraid
 of


making
 a
 mistake
 is
 going
 to
 like
 free


you
 up
 so
 much
 mentally
 in
 the
 kitchen.


>> Well,
 we're
 going
 to
 take
 a
 quick
 break


and
 then
 when
 we're
 back,
 we're
 going
 to


dive
 deeper
 [music]
 into
 the
 cookie


baking
 process
 to
 get
 the
 results
 that


you
 really
 want.
 And
 we're
 also
 going
 to


talk
 with
 Van
 about
 the
 most
 [music]


common
 mistakes
 people
 make
 when
 baking


and
 how
 to
 troubleshoot
 when
 you've


messed
 something
 up
 and
 more
 listener


questions.


>> Yay.
 So
 stick
 around.
 We'll
 be
 right


back.


[music]


[music]


Welcome
 back.
 Our
 guest
 today
 is
 Von


Reland
 from
 New
 York
 Times
 Cooking.


We're
 talking
 about
 his
 new
 book,


Cookies.
 Before
 the
 break,
 we
 talked


about
 the
 gear
 you
 need
 to
 bake
 and
 Van


fielded
 a
 couple
 of
 questions
 from
 our


listeners.


>> That's
 right.
 So,
 we've
 got
 a
 great


listener
 question
 to
 get
 us
 started.
 So,


let's
 hear
 from
 Jennifer.


>> Hi,
 wire
 cutter.
 This
 is
 Jennifer
 Molina


and
 I
 am
 calling
 right
 now
 from
 Bill


Bao,
 Spain.
 Although
 normally
 I
 live
 in


California.
 This
 is
 a
 burning
 cookie


question
 I
 always
 have.
 I
 like
 thick,


dense
 cookies.
 Um,
 and
 sometimes
 when


I'm
 baking,
 they
 actually
 come
 out
 a
 bit


flatter
 than
 I
 would
 like.
 I
 want


topography
 dense
 amazing
 cookies.
 What


am
 I
 doing
 incorrectly?
 Thanks
 so
 much.


>> Let's
 help
 Jennifer.


>> I
 mean,


>> she
 needs
 a
 topographical
 cookie.


>> Jennifer
 is
 a
 person
 after
 my
 own
 heart.


I
 mean,
 I
 am
 a
 chewy,
 dense
 cookie


person.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 when
 cookies


spread
 a
 little
 bit
 too
 much,
 there


could
 be
 a
 few
 things
 going
 on.
 You


could
 overcrowd
 your
 pan
 and
 that
 will


create
 more
 of
 this
 like
 radiation
 of


heat
 as
 the
 cookies
 around
 it
 absorb


more
 heat.
 Another
 thing
 is
 chilling
 the


dough.
 If
 you're
 not
 properly
 chilling


the
 dough
 or
 if
 you
 like
 have
 a
 cookie


recipe
 that
 you
 really
 like
 the
 flavor


of,
 you
 might
 want
 to
 chill
 the
 dough


before
 you
 actually
 bake
 it,
 which
 will


help
 mitigate
 that
 spread.


>> And
 you
 would
 recommend
 scooping
 them


onto
 the
 sheetpan
 and
 then
 putting
 them


in
 the
 refrigerator.


>> Yeah,
 I
 always
 scoop
 and
 then
 chill.


Some
 people
 would
 probably
 say
 like,


"No,
 you
 need
 to
 like
 chill
 the
 whole


mass
 of
 dough
 because
 drying
 out
 and


whatnot.
 If
 you
 wrap
 it
 well,
 it
 should


be
 fine."
 But
 it's
 so
 much
 easier
 to


scoop
 the
 dough
 at
 room
 temperature
 than


to
 scoop
 it
 when
 it's
 cold.
 And
 that
 is


how
 [clears throat]
 I've
 broken
 cookie


scoops
 before.
 Um,
 [laughter]


so
 yeah,
 chilling.
 And
 then
 also
 your


ratios.
 Like
 I
 was
 testing
 my
 cookie
 for


cookie
 week
 this
 year
 and
 it
 was


spreading
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 than
 I


wanted.
 So
 then
 I
 swapped
 the
 quantities


of
 granulated
 sugar
 and
 brown
 sugar
 and


it
 made
 this
 topographically
 beautiful


mounded
 cookie.


>> And
 you
 put
 in
 more
 brown
 sugar.


>> Put
 in
 more
 of
 a
 ratio
 of
 brown
 sugar.


So
 brown
 sugar
 is
 going
 to
 give
 cookies


a
 lot
 of
 that
 chew
 because
 of
 its


moisture
 and
 it's
 got
 all
 that
 molassesy


notes
 in
 it.
 So
 it
 also
 gives
 it


beautiful
 flavor.
 White
 sugar
 helps
 with


the
 crisp
 around
 the
 edges
 and
 also


typically
 creates
 a
 spread
 in
 cookies.


Also
 just
 make
 sure
 that
 your
 leavenning


like
 your
 baking
 soda
 and
 your
 baking


powder
 is
 up
 to
 date.
 Go
 to
 the
 store,


maybe
 buy
 a
 new
 one
 if
 you
 don't
 think


that
 you've
 gotten
 a
 new
 one
 in
 the
 last


like
 couple
 years.
 Get
 a
 new
 baking


soda.
 Get
 a
 new
 baking
 powder.


>> I
 did
 not
 think
 that
 that
 would
 be
 a


thing
 that
 would
 have
 a
 big
 impact
 if


they
 were
 past
 an
 expiration
 date.
 I


just
 I
 wouldn't
 think
 about
 baking
 soda


in
 that
 way.


>> Totally.
 Yeah,
 leavenning
 can
 like


really
 react
 differently
 with
 certain


things.


>> Well,
 we
 actually
 have
 another
 listener


question
 along
 these
 lines.
 Let's
 let's


hear
 it.


>> Hey,
 wire
 cutter.
 My
 name
 is
 Caitlyn
 and


I
 live
 in
 Strawburg,
 France,
 where
 I
 am


an
 American
 expat.
 So
 my
 cookie
 dilemma


is
 that
 most
 French
 people
 in
 my
 life


love
 when
 I
 make
 cookies
 because
 they


associate
 cookies
 just
 with
 chocolate


chip.
 So
 learning
 how
 much
 versatility


there
 is
 in
 cookie
 making
 is
 really
 fun.


But
 most
 of
 the
 French
 people
 in
 my
 life


have
 a
 way
 lower
 tolerance
 for
 sugar


than
 most
 the
 Americans
 in
 my
 life
 do.


So
 I
 sometimes
 find
 myself
 reducing
 the


amount
 of
 sugar
 but
 then
 it
 messes
 with


the
 texture.
 So,
 what
 advice
 do
 you
 have


on
 reducing
 the
 sugar
 on
 in
 cookies?
 And


also,
 do
 you
 have
 a
 great
 recommendation


for
 a
 not
 too
 overly
 sweet
 holiday


cookie
 that
 I
 can
 make
 to
 impress
 my


friends?
 Thanks.


>> That's
 a
 great
 question.
 Also,
 that's
 so


funny
 cuz
 like
 I
 studied
 abroad
 in


France
 and
 there's
 definitely
 a


difference
 between
 a
 biscuit,
 which
 is


like
 the
 English
 would
 say
 biscuit
 to


say
 cookie.
 There's
 definitely
 a


difference
 between
 that
 and
 like
 a


cookie.
 Like
 a
 cookie.
 [laughter]
 cookie


is
 like
 like
 a
 chocolate
 chip
 cookie
 is


exactly
 what
 she
 said.
 So,
 you're


thinking
 about
 the
 different
 forms
 of


sweetener
 out
 there.
 There's
 obviously


brown
 sugar,
 white
 sugar,
 different


types
 of
 sugars.
 There's
 maple
 syrup,


there's
 honey.
 I
 wouldn't
 necessarily
 go


with
 swapping
 a
 maple
 syrup
 or
 a
 honey


because
 they
 actually
 are
 a
 little
 bit


sweeter
 by
 volume
 than
 actual
 sugar


sugar.
 You
 know,
 brown
 sugar
 does
 have
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 deeper
 flavor.
 So,
 if


you
 have
 access
 to
 brown
 sugar,
 I
 think


that
 that
 would
 honestly
 create
 like
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 a
 richer
 nuance
 to
 the


cookie
 itself
 rather
 than
 just
 like
 a


granulated
 sugar
 cookie.
 In
 terms
 of


reducing
 the
 amount
 of
 sugar,
 you're


right,
 like
 the
 sugar
 is
 also
 there
 to


add
 structure
 to
 the
 cookie.
 And
 so
 I


would
 say
 tinker
 with
 the
 amount
 of
 fat


that
 you're
 using
 in
 the
 recipe
 because


that's
 also
 going
 to
 create
 more
 of
 an


issue
 when
 you're
 like
 blending
 the


butter
 and
 the
 sugar
 together
 in
 the


beginning
 phases
 of
 mixing
 before
 you


add
 the
 dry
 ingredients.


>> See,
 this
 is
 why
 baking
 intimidates
 me


because
 if
 you
 want
 to
 mess
 with
 one


thing,
 you
 have
 to
 mess
 with
 everything


else.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 then
 if
 I
 was
 thinking


about
 it,
 it's
 like
 if
 you
 go
 down
 on


the
 sugar,
 then
 you
 go
 down
 on
 the
 fat,


but
 then
 is
 the
 cookie
 going
 to
 be
 too


dry?
 Because
 of
 the
 one
 like
 really


great
 secret
 ingredient
 for
 a
 lot
 of


cookies
 is
 water.
 Okay.


>> Water
 actually
 like
 really
 does
 help


with
 a
 lot
 of
 moisture
 loss
 or
 like
 if
 a


cookie
 is
 too
 dry.
 If
 she's
 going
 down


to
 the
 sugar
 and
 then
 subsequently
 goes


down
 the
 fat,
 maybe
 the
 cookie
 is
 going


to
 be
 a
 little
 dry
 because
 the
 dry


ingredients
 are
 kind
 of
 overwhelming


that
 fat
 that's
 in
 there.
 Add
 a
 little


bit
 of
 water
 in
 there
 and
 see
 what


happens.


>> So,
 do
 you
 have
 a
 specific
 holiday


cookie
 maybe
 she
 could
 bring
 to
 impress


her
 her
 people
 that's
 not
 too
 sweet?


>> Yes.
 I
 would
 say
 I've
 got
 this
 chewy


brownie
 cookie
 recipe
 that's
 topped
 with


flaky
 salt.
 So,
 [laughter]
 like
 if
 she's


a
 chocolate
 lover,


>> I
 would
 say
 go
 with
 that
 because
 it's


not
 too
 sweet.
 The
 chocolate
 flavor
 is


like
 really
 chocolatey
 and
 also
 what


offsets
 the
 sweetness
 also
 is
 a
 little


bit
 of
 flaky
 salt
 on
 top.
 [music]


You
 have
 some
 really
 interesting
 recipes


and
 flavor
 combinations
 in
 the
 book.


Some
 using
 really
 savory
 ingredients
 you


don't
 necessarily
 see
 in
 cookie
 recipes


all
 of
 the
 time.
 So,
 for
 example,
 the


Filipino
 inspired
 recipe
 for
 the
 adobo


chocolate
 chip
 that
 uses
 a
 full


tablespoon
 of
 pink
 peppercorns,
 which
 I


thought
 was
 very
 cool.
 Are
 there
 other


savory
 ingredients
 you
 think
 should
 be


on
 people's
 radar
 when
 it
 comes
 to


elevating
 sweet
 baking?


>> Oh,
 totally.
 Miso.
 My
 mind
 immediately


goes
 to
 miso.


>> Talk
 about
 miso.


>> Miso
 is
 so
 good
 in
 cookies.
 It's
 so
 good


in
 cookies.
 It
 adds
 this
 level
 of


savoriness
 that's
 just
 like
 really


beautiful.
 Eric
 Kim
 has
 a
 go
 jang
 uh


caramel
 cookie.
 Very
 good.
 They're
 so


good.
 And
 go
 jang
 has
 like
 a
 natural


sweetness
 to
 it.
 A
 lot
 of
 brands
 do.
 It


just
 pairs
 really
 well
 and
 it
 adds
 this


level
 of
 spice
 to
 it
 which
 I
 really


love.
 Olive
 oil
 is
 another
 thing
 that


people
 typically
 associate
 with
 savory,


but
 in
 cookies
 in
 any
 baked
 good,
 but


especially
 like
 a
 cookie
 with
 olive
 oil,


delicious.
 that
 just
 gives
 it
 again
 this


other
 level
 of
 flavor
 that
 you


>> don't
 know
 you
 wanted
 yet.
 [music]


>> So,
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 some
 very
 quick


lightning
 round
 questions
 around
 common


problems
 that
 people
 have
 with
 their


cookies.
 So,
 you
 quickly
 diagnose
 what


to
 do.


>> Okay.


>> Okay.


>> Cookies
 are
 too
 hard.


>> Overbaked.


>> Cookies
 are
 too
 cakey.


>> Ooh.
 Uh,
 too
 much
 flour,
 too
 much
 dry


ingredient.


>> The
 cookies
 spread
 too
 much
 when
 baking,


>> improperly
 chilled,
 or
 too
 much
 fat
 or


they're
 too
 close
 together.


>> Okay.
 Could
 be
 a
 number
 of
 things.


>> Could
 be
 another
 things.


>> Uh,
 cookies
 are
 burned
 on
 the
 bottom.


>> Check
 your
 sheet
 tray.
 Check
 your
 oven


temp.


>> Do
 you
 mean
 like
 put
 a
 thermometer
 in


there
 and
 actually
 check
 it?


>> 1,000%.
 You
 should
 buy.


>> So,
 don't
 don't
 rely
 on
 what
 your
 oven


is
 telling
 you.
 Get
 an
 get
 a
 little


thermometer
 that
 you
 can
 put
 inside
 your


oven.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 I
 think
 everybody
 should
 have


an
 oven
 thermometer.
 My
 oven
 runs
 50°


hotter
 than


>> 50°.


>> That's
 wild.


>> Yeah.
 Like
 I
 have
 to
 set
 it
 to
 400
 in


order
 to
 bake
 something
 at
 3.


>> I
 think
 I
 have
 the
 same
 problem.
 And
 I


always
 am
 kind
 of
 subconsciously
 uh


accounting
 for
 that
 when
 I'm
 cooking.


>> Yeah.
 Even
 like
 nice
 new
 ovens,
 like
 we


have
 great
 ones
 at
 the
 studio.
 One
 of


them
 always
 runs
 like
 if
 you
 set
 it
 to


350
 it
 will
 be
 400.
 If
 they're
 burning


on
 the
 bottom,
 then
 there's
 too
 much


heat
 that's
 coming
 in
 contact
 with
 the


sheet
 tray
 before
 the
 rest
 of
 it
 can
 get


baked
 through.


>> Be
 kind
 to
 yourself.
 It
 might
 not
 be
 a


you
 problem.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 totally.


>> I
 know
 your
 equipment,
 too.


>> I
 wish
 there
 were
 more
 answers
 in
 life


like
 that.


>> I
 know.
 [laughter]


>> Yeah.
 1,000%.


>> Okay,
 Van.
 Well,
 before
 we
 wrap,
 we


always
 ask
 our
 guests
 one
 final


question.
 What's
 the
 last
 thing
 you


bought
 that
 you
 really
 loved?


>> My
 boooo.
 No.
 Uh,
 [laughter]


>> I
 mean,
 I
 saw
 it
 today.
 I
 was
 like,


"What
 is
 that?
 I've
 never
 seen
 one
 in


real
 life."


>> And
 now
 I've
 seen
 my
 second
 one
 today.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 joining
 us.
 This


was
 really,
 really
 fun.


>> Thank
 you.
 Oh,
 I
 had
 the
 best
 time.
 I


could
 talk
 about
 cookies
 all
 day.


[music]


[music]


>> What
 a
 lovely
 conversation
 with
 Fawn


Delight.
 He
 is
 great.
 I
 would
 love
 to


receive
 a
 box
 of
 cookies
 from
 him
 just


in
 case
 he's
 listening
 to
 this
 episode.


Um,


>> I
 was
 kind
 of
 hoping
 he'd
 bring
 one
 in


today
 actually.
 [laughter]


>> What
 are
 you
 taking
 away
 from
 this


conversation?


>> Well,
 I
 was
 reminded
 that
 I
 really


should
 have
 a
 thermometer
 in
 my
 oven.
 I


forgot
 that
 I
 should
 do
 that
 and
 I
 I


will
 be
 doing
 that
 because
 it's
 not
 just


an
 important
 thing
 for
 baking,
 but
 it's


also
 for
 cooking.
 So,
 I
 don't
 have
 to


live
 in
 mystery
 anymore.


>> You
 knew
 you
 couldn't
 trust
 your
 own


oven.
 [laughter]


mine
 because
 I'm
 not
 much
 of
 a
 baker
 and


as
 I've
 discussed
 at
 length
 on
 this


podcast,
 I
 don't
 really
 eat
 sweets


because
 I'm
 non-dairy
 and
 whatever,


whatever.
 I
 think
 I
 would
 go
 for
 the


scale
 that
 he
 recommended
 and
 a
 spoonula


because
 those
 are
 things
 that
 you
 can


use
 for
 both
 baking
 and
 cooking.
 And
 you


know,
 I
 love
 a
 good
 versatile
 kitchen


tool.


>> I
 think
 the
 scale
 is
 another
 one
 of


those
 things
 where
 you
 are
 mitigating


variability.
 For
 me,
 I
 am
 going
 to
 grow


up
 and
 get
 a
 cooling
 rack.
 Grow
 up.
 I


[laughter]
 know.
 It's
 just
 like
 And
 I'm


going
 to
 get
 one
 that
 fits
 in
 a
 half


sheet
 pan.
 I
 think
 it's
 It
 just
 sounds


like
 it's
 worth
 it.
 Even
 if
 I
 use
 it


>> twice
 a
 year.


>> It's
 not
 just
 going
 to
 sit
 in
 your


kitchen.
 You'll
 use
 it.
