I think it would be my dream to always use
the highest quality ingredients.
I'd love to use like old ugly shallots
that nobody wants and the bad tomatoes
and like
make something beautiful from waste.
And and that's my aspiration.
And and that business model
let down a very, very expensive path
and I think
is achievable at massive scale.
But we're just not there yet.
Wait. Say more about that.
Basically that is sort of the
the issue with CPG in general.
And if you want to make
a small mom and pop like locally sourced,
like beautifully made, responsibly
pay your workers excellent wages
and it's going to be like a $38
jar of tomato sauce.
And it's going to be
a very limited market of people
that are willing to pay for that.
And, you know,
I look at my local grocery store
and I the first thing I do
is I go to the tomato sauce aisle.
I'm just like,
got to know what's going on over there.
But you see Rao’s and Carbone
on the same eye level
and additional, merchandizing behind you.
And they are both on sale for $8.99,
and that's a 32 ounce jar.
Our jars are 16oz.
And you know, $12.99 or $12 retail.
Hello, and welcome to
another episode of the Odd Lots podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal. And I'm Tracy Alloway.
So, Tracy,
we're recording this on February 4th, and,
a lot of tech
stocks have been getting clobbered lately.
But you know what's doing really well?
What companies that make, consumer
staples, all of like, the core staples
that you'd see in your pantry, etc.,
like your Pepsi Cola and all this stuff.
Companies that might make, like, jarred
sauces and stuff, people are returning
to sort of, the old style basics
that people buy in the stock market.
Who would have thought that food is land?
Amazing food persist. Nobody's serious.
You know, it's like the only place to hide
right now on the market.
Like, I look at my screen
and everything is bright red,
and the only thing that people
feel comfortable betting on right now
seems to basically be food.
Pasta sauce and the stuff
that, that people have eaten for all time
and probably will be eating for as long as
there are people on earth, right?
And this always.
So I find this business really interesting
because, you know, I joke
that food is Lindy in many ways, but,
you know, like food is right.
Food is essential,
but it's also constantly changing.
Yeah, it feels like.
And so I'm always very curious
about how consumer brands actually make
pricing decisions, branding decisions,
especially because
it also feels like an area
that's very crowded.
You know, you walk into the supermarket
and there's like 20 different
brands of,
I don't know, flour or something.
No, totally.
You know, one of the things,
you know, we've done various CPG episodes
over the years and we did some episodes
about like Celsius energy drink and stuff.
And one of the themes that we sort of
maybe I hadn't appreciated prior is like
that competition for shelf space.
Yeah, the distribution aspect,
getting on the shelf,
getting a spot in the truck
that delivers the beverages
to the grocery store or to the bodega
or whatever, like so much of the game is.
Yes, the brand. Yes, the product.
And then just the sort of logistical
aspects of it.
And I think like that, that sort of
we don't talk about it enough,
but as a theme, I love, like
learning about this space,
how the CPG business works,
because it just to your point,
especially with regards to pricing
and so forth, it's so illuminating
about how the whole economy works.
Is that a word?
Illuminating? Illuminating? Yeah.
Very good.
Well, we do have the perfect guest.
I'm very excited to say we do have
the perfect guest today, someone who is,
in the tomato sauce business
but really known for, so much more.
One of the,
I would say,
most famous people in the food world
these days,
we are going to be speaking with Alison
Roman.
She's a cook and the author.
She has a grocery
store called First Bloom that,
I missed when they had a pop up
Manhattan location.
I missed it. Hopefully, you know,
that'll get reopened at some point.
And tomato sauce business
called A Very Good Tomato Sauce.
So Alison,
thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots.
Oh, thank you for having me.
This is a pleasure. Where to begin?
You are this,
a genuine celebrity of the food world.
People are addicted,
and they love your recipes.
I just at home two nights ago,
my wife made your,
I think it was like a broccoli
cheddar soup that you have a recipe for.
Yeah, that's a deep dish.
That is is a deep cut.
That's cool.
I've had your famous, chickpeas do.
Yeah, that went viral.
We've had multiple recipes go viral.
But how did you decide to get into
why a tomato sauce.
I think I well, I got my start
working in professional kitchens
and I worked in editorial,
and then I sort of went off on my own
writing books
and doing miscellaneous things
and my whole career
as sort of a recipe writer, cookbook
author has been teaching you how to cook
and being like, why would you buy anything
when you can make it yourself?
You know,
as the person who their pantry is
lined with like ingredients
rather than, you know, things.
So it's funny that
I that got into the tomato sauce business
because I've written recipes
for tomato sauce,
and I'm very proud of mine,
and I think it's delicious
and easy to make and anyone can do it.
And then the older I got
and I married a man who does not cook.
I had a baby.
The baby does not cook yet either,
unfortunately.
I needed to eat more.
I needed someone to cook for me
and it just became sort of this question
I had of like, why am I so allergic to
the tomato sauce is on the market?
Why am I not embracing of the things
that are currently available?
And I realized it's
because I'm, well, a very picky,
b probably very snobby.
See, I just was sort of, you know, like,
I do want to make it myself.
I do want to sort of control here.
So I made it myself.
And when I had opened the grocery store
first bloom, I decided to start
including it as like a line of things
that we would keep in the freezer
a chicken broth, beans, tomato sauce,
things that we would make in the store
to sell to people at the market.
And very soon the demand exceeded supply.
And I, you know, for all the things
that I do, I did not want to be full time
making tomato sauce.
There was just I didn't have
the equipment, I didn't have the time.
And so I was approached by somebody who is
in the tomato sauce making business.
And she was like,
why don't you just outsource it
and have somebody make your recipe?
And I was like, well,
how is that going to work?
You know, like how?
But won't people know the difference
and how could it possibly scale?
And through a lot of trial and error,
I figured out we can scale it.
I definitely want to ask about scaling up,
but before we do, were
you daunted at all by doing tomato sauce
specifically
because this seems to be an area
where there is a lot of competition,
especially between
I can think of two like big players,
which will be Rouse and Carbon.
Right?
What are those cheap stuff?
And I guess those aren't the competitors.
Yeah, I bought the carbon things once,
which probably maybe says something
about it. But anyway,
how do you
differentiate your product from, you know,
those names with very, very strong
branding and customer recognition?
Yeah, I think it's an interesting thing
because sometimes, often people
start a business
saying what doesn't exist.
There's a hole in the market,
I'm going to fill it.
And obviously tomato sauce.
There are many brands constantly
fighting for sale prices and shelf space.
But there wasn't a tomato sauce like mine
and there wasn't.
I find that most tomato
sauce is on the market,
especially the popular ones.
Rose carbon, etc.
are more marinara and style.
They are,
you know, more uniform in texture.
They are sweeter.
They tend to have oregano.
There's just like a specific vibe
that they're going for.
And I think to me, sort of modeled
after the like old school Progresso,
which is what my mom growing up.
And that's what I ate.
And I think that that was sort of the gold
standard.
And people kind of went down that path.
And it's interesting
because we talk about carbon as like the,
you know, top two, they're not very old.
Yeah.
And so we in our consciousness like, oh,
well that's the top two.
Well they've only been the top two
for as long as they've been around
which somebody can fact check.
But I believe it's only a few years.
Yeah I think that's right. Yeah.
So it's not like this legacy brand
that I'm competing with.
It's just another company
with name recognition,
a lot of financial backing and strong
branding.
And I also noticed that all the tomato
sauces were sort of like chef focused and,
and male dominated energy.
It was sort of like a chef,
a guy, a bro, a person's name.
That was a guy.
And I don't know, I just was sort of like,
I want to do something totally different,
even if it's tomato sauce,
I don't think they're all created equal.
And so with everything I do,
I genuinely try to ask myself,
does this already exist?
And if not, then I want to make it.
I have some thoughts
about Chef Bro energy,
but I'm going to save them
for after the plug.
I can't wait. No, I'm going.
To save them for after the episode.
Let's talk about I mean,
I want to want to talk about the entire
from your conception in your mind to,
the end consumer, the whole supply chain.
So I want to, like, really
break it down and understand it.
But let's start with, like,
how do you scale up a recipe?
Because quality control,
you have some recipe that you make
in your kitchen
and you really like it, etc.
but then there's, you know,
but then making it in large batches,
totally different game and then you're
not there to supervise it all the time.
Talk to us
a little bit about that process,
how just how that even works, such that
a recipe that you make at home can be done
by someone else at a different facility
in volume, and it's still the same recipe.
Yeah, I think that you have to consider,
you know, there's a lot of knowledge
that goes into it of like your knowledge
of cooking and how ingredients,
you know, they're not a one for one.
You can't just multiply it
by ten and be like,
this is going to be the same thing. Also,
the equipment is different.
How they're doing things are different.
We have three flavors.
We have a garlicky tomato,
which is sort of your classic, a spicy
fennel, which is spicy
and has fennel as advertised.
And then a caramelized shallot anchovy,
which is modeled
after the shallot pasta, which.
Is, which went viral during the
I think we all at one point probably.
Made it
if I, if I have no fans, the shallot pasta
will still have a million like it is.
It is more famous than I am for sure.
And that was the trickiest one to nail
because the caramelizing
of the shallots,
the addition of anchovies. Yeah.
I ended up having to go back three times
after we had jarred the first batch
and adjust the recipe,
which I didn't have to do at the end
with the others.
But because shallots,
when you caramelize at a large scale,
they tend to get soft and jammy
and very sweet,
which increases the sweetness
perception of the final product.
We ended up switching to a different
method of cooking the shallots.
I ended up reducing the amount entirely,
cooking them further.
Like it?
The whole thing had to change as soon as
we started getting to the batch size.
And each co-packer is different.
So I think, you know an issue.
We can we'll get there.
But if you talk about scaling, it's
each Co-packer
is going to handle things differently.
And right now
we're with a pretty small co-packer,
which I like because I can visit them
in from my apartment.
They're in Industry City, Brooklyn, and
I go there and I can taste the batches.
I can say, okay, we multiplied
the chili flake in this recipe
and now it's way too spicy.
So we're actually going to cut it by half,
which is it seems to stand
the reason
that that would be not nearly as spicy,
but because of the way
the ingredients behave.
It is, you know, so stuff like that
where you're sort of in the lab,
as it were, tweaking as it goes.
And I think that the more
I explore the CPG world,
that is the biggest challenge of
you can't just send a recipe in
and hope for the best.
Like, you really have to be tweaking
and adjusting at scale.
How big is the tomato sauce
making operation right now?
Like in people?
It's two.
People. Two people? Yeah.
So it's like it's it's
relatively small. Yes.
They have big massive kettles.
And I think that also
when you think of like, why tomato sauce.
Like I just, I kind of knew
that getting there would maybe be the path
of least resistance and,
and that I'm not inventing something
from scratch or not, you know,
requiring equipment that nobody has.
Like these are kettles that you can make
many different things in.
And so coat packers are a bit easier
to find.
These particular
co packers specialize in tomato sauce.
And most that I've encountered do.
And that's like what they do.
And so they are you know well informed.
I'm sorry I might ask
just a lot of like really remedial.
I love it about this.
So let's go deep the
the kitchen, the two person kitchen
where they're making
that is a separate facility
than the Co-packer.
Or is it the same entity.
It's the same entity.
Okay. So we have
we have the the place the warehouse
where the tomato sauce gets made.
They get the jars
and they sterilize the jars.
They make the sauce, they batch the sauce,
they put them in the boxes.
The boxes then get shipped to a third
party logistics warehouse,
which is actually not far
from where the tomato sauce is made.
So we cut down on shipping a bit.
And that is where the tomato
sauce comes from when you order it online,
because right now we are
we do have it in store up in the upstate
grocery store. But,
for a few reasons, which we can also
get into, we are just DDC.
Got it. Yeah.
And then again,
maybe very obvious question when it comes
to, you know, maybe at some point you grow
and it'll be ten people, etc.
in the food industry, are there chefs
whose job is more or less to specialize
in cooking at scale,
that basically it's like, okay, someone
has an idea for a tomato sauce like you,
you know, you're not
you can't be there every day.
Other people who, like, have
professionalized the art of scaling up a.
Recipe for volume.
I mean, I've never heard of that job
specifically, but I mean, the guy,
who makes the
tomato sauce for us
like that is his primary.
I mean, he was a chef, you know, did
a lot of catering, a private chef, etc..
And then I think to understand
how to make things at scale you do have,
it's a lot of trial and error.
You have to, like, understand it
from a different perspective.
But even working in restaurants,
I experience this
because you take recipes built for a home
cook, especially, say, baking.
You're going to make biscuits
for a restaurant.
You take a recipe that you like
from somebody's cookbook. What?
I don't know.
And you're like, okay, well,
now I have to make these biscuits for
I have to make 200 of them a day.
I'm not making 60.
Yeah, and you cannot
just multiply that recipe ever.
And so I had a bit of experience in,
in the baking world working at scale
because you're never making 16
of something in a pastry
kitchen. You're making 200.
And so you kind of understand
and and also conversely,
working at the bottom of Test Kitchen,
when I first started working there,
we were doing a lot more chef
driven recipes.
And when you work in a professional
kitchen, you're making sauce.
You're making 16 quarts of sauce,
you're not making two cups of sauce.
So the sort of reverse engineering that
understanding that it's the same thing.
The ingredients ebb and flow
even if you're decreasing.
So it's just kind of having
that knowledge ahead of time.
But I think that's how those people
find themselves as a co-packer.
And as we look into other products
to make, it's like,
okay, well,
these guys specialize in baked goods.
These guys specialize in granola.
These guys, you know,
and they're that's what they do.
So they they know.
How did you go about finding suppliers
because, you know,
I imagine you have some connection
with your grocery store to,
you know, farmers maybe.
But if you're doing it at scale
or a larger scale than previously,
how do you actually find someone who's
going to provide you with a steady
supply of tomatoes or a steady
supply of shallots and anchovies, I guess?
Yeah, we use canned tomatoes.
In the summer we will do limited edition,
quantities of things like,
you know, bruised tomatoes, SunGold
tomatoes, like more in-season fresh stuff.
But because tomatoes are so seasonal
and I also believe the best tomato sauce
does come from canned tomatoes,
that is part isn't an issue,
but it really is.
I had, worked with this woman, Isabel,
who had more experience in CPG,
and we sort of figured it out together
with, my chief of staff, Nani.
And it was kind of the three of us
looking at numbers and saying, like,
who's located where?
What is the shipping going to cost?
What tomatoes are they using,
what tomatoes can they get?
What is their capacity like?
How how quickly can we grow here?
And so all of those things
come into factor because honestly,
the type of shallots you're
using at that scale doesn't really matter.
I think it would be my dream to always use
the highest quality ingredients.
I'd love to use like old ugly shallots
that nobody wants and the bad tomatoes
and like
make something beautiful from waste.
And and that's my aspiration.
And and that business model
let down a very, very expensive path
and I think
is achievable at massive scale.
But we're just not there yet.
Wait. Say more about that.
Basically, that is sort of the
the issue with CPG in general. And
if you want to
make a small mom and pop,
like locally sourced
like beautifully made, responsibly
pay your workers excellent wages
and it's going to be like a $38
jar of tomato sauce.
And it's going to be
a very limited market of people
that are willing to pay for that.
And, you know,
I look at my local grocery store
and I the first thing I do
is I go to the tomato sauce aisle.
I'm just like,
got to know what's going on over there.
But you see Rao’s and Carbone
on the same eye level
and additional, merchandizing behind you.
And they are both on sale for $8.99,
and that's a 32 ounce jar.
Our jars are 16oz and,
you know, $12.99 or $12 retail.
Joe, I'm going to betray
my elder millennial status,
but I'm thinking of that friends episode
where Monica starts
making jam and selling it,
and then she realizes that, like,
in order to break even, it has to be $17
per jar, which was a lot back then.
There was a lot.
Of people who else made jam?
And me, I don't know.
Yeah. Tell us about your jam.
I mean, that was a million years ago
when I first moved to New York,
and I was working at Milk Bar at the time
and used their commissary kitchen
to sort of decide
I was going to make jam and sell it
at the Williamsburg Smorgasburg.
And yeah, when it first launched and say,
oh yeah, baby.
And, you know, handwriting each label
like getting beautiful jars,
which cost $4 a piece, like
the economics were so poor I didn't care.
I wanted to do it anyway.
And as long as we could make more money
to buy more jars
and then make more jam,
obviously that was not sustainable.
It didn't last for very long,
maybe a year and a half.
But same concept where, okay, in order
to get this actually done
and to actually turn a profit,
you're like, okay, well that's why
people go for the jugular immediately
and seek out,
you know, investment and say,
we need to be on target to launch.
Let's do a business scale.
Yeah.
One of my favorite books I've read, is by
is the autobiography of the Nike
founder, Phil.
Nice shoe dog shoe dog.
And he talks a lot about, you know,
they started small with sneakers.
And then there was, you know,
this sort of jump where it's like
he had the opportunity to get a lot bigger
banks didn't really want to give him loans
because it seemed dicey.
It wasn't like a VC style business,
but he clearly needed capital to sort of
take it to the next level,
like bigger factories, etc..
Talk to us a little bit
about like financial scaling
and the risks that involved with like,
okay, one day you don't want it to just be
two people in a kitchen.
You had to be 20 people
or 200 people in the kitchen.
Well, that requires a lot of upfront costs
and new warehouses.
Maybe talk to us
about how you're thinking about that
or what you've seen on the landscape
in terms of your options.
Yeah, I mean, it seems like the
what you're fed in terms of like the media
coverage of brands and you're like,
oh, this brand has $3 million out the gate
and this brand has six months.
And that doesn't mean
that brands can succeed.
That doesn't mean that that brand is.
Going in the hole
because they have to pay that back. Yes.
Multiple interest
before the founder sees a penny of.
Exactly.
And it also means that there's
a lot of pressure to increase SKUs
and marketing and it's a, to me,
a very overwhelming landscape
that is not rooted in authenticity
or something being good.
And that, to me is always going to be
the most important thing that I do.
I also want to do it intelligently
and make sure that it's not like
a financial crazy firestorm.
But I think that right now,
literally today, after this, I'm
going to a few meetings, but I am right
in the thick of it, of figuring out
that the answer to that question of like,
who do I hire?
How do I hire them? At what level?
Who is going to actually help me?
Who basically my desire is to hire
somebody,
two people, three people
who are excellent at what they do.
I am not a business person.
I am a tomato sauce person.
I make tomato sauce
and I make really good tomato sauce.
I don't know how to do these other things.
And what I do know is that I'm not trying
to scale up at such an intense rate
that it sacrifices the quality
or the integrity, or puts me in a position
to grow the business
faster than I want to.
And, you know,
I think it's interesting because
a lot of times people start businesses,
especially in the food CPG world,
where the immediate thought is before
they've even made the product.
How do I sell it?
Like how do I what's my exit?
Okay.
In six years, we could,
you know, it's like what happened
to just making a great product
that people are really into.
And I think I have the luxury
of having 42 other jobs.
And so, you know, I'm a writer,
I do video, I make cookbooks, and
I think that knowing
that this isn't my primary,
you know, the one thing
that I'm betting on, but I do think that
there's a sort of credibility
that's been lost in developing products
and I think that people are going
to start to want that.
And I think that they're going to be like,
well,
why would I buy this person's tomatoes?
I was like,
because I'm seeing it everywhere,
or this one because I trust it,
that it comes from a good place.
What kind of.
Lenders or investors do you actually talk
to for this sort of thing?
Is it like VC?
I don't yet,
but that would ostensibly be it.
I think that for me personally,
I've self-funded every project
I've ever done and I've kind
of taken this to its maximum,
in that
I'm not that in the red and it will
I will be whole probably
by the end of the year, which is great.
It's more that I want to be sure
if I'm going to ask for money.
It's I want to ask for money from people
that understand me
and are not expecting me
to be someone else, or model
my business off after those other ones
that they see as being successful.
And I say that today.
Ask me next year
and I might be in a different position,
but I think it's sort of, you know,
a friends and family around style.
Or one main investor
who sort of sees me, sees the goal
and is like, I want to be the lead
and I want to be sort of the primary.
Do you have to bring like actual jars
of the sauce when you meet with investors?
I know you haven't done it yet,
but I'm really curious
if you have a food company,
is that a requirement or are people just
looking at the numbers and the branding
and the distribution network?
I think it could hurt.
I think that if you are a lesser
known quantity, that's probably a must.
I would I mean, I'd
want you to know what I'm selling you
and why you should invest in it.
It's giving Shark Tank. Yeah.
But I think for me,
I've been very fortunate that I've already
sort of been approached by people
that are like, I like what you do.
I like everything that you do.
Everything you do works.
And like, I have no reason to believe
this would be any different,
even though I do know,
given the saturation of the market
and how crowded it is, it is sort of, oh.
Why would you enter into
what was effectively the most crowded,
you know, market?
But again,
I see my contribution as being unique.
This might be sort
of a sensitive question.
You know, there is a
I think you have cult status
within, certain among some people.
We seem to be in an age where people
with a certain level of cult status,
they have these fans who like, really
just like
they want to buy something from you.
They're excited to give that
the opportunity to do business with you.
Yes, Taylor Swift's fans
want her to make five different color
vinyl versions of each album
because they're really excited about.
And they'll buy each one.
Yeah, and Donald Trump's fans
really, like, want him to like,
you know, make a vodka brand and whatever
because they're excited about that.
Buying Trump vodka I know.
Do you feel that
like do you feel that you have like a base
that is enthusiastic about the prospect
of essentially supporting you
and like being part of your,
you know, growing your world?
Yeah.
I think that I am very fortunate
to have been in this industry
for as long as I have.
And I think that with
that comes a reputation and trust.
And you cannot buy that trust
and you cannot force it to happen
over a short period of time.
And I think that it is familiarity.
But above all, people are like,
I know this works,
or I know when she recommends something,
it is good.
And so it stands to reason
if I'm going to make if I'm going to
put my name behind something and like
put my own money behind,
starting a company like this
isn't a money grab, you know, it's
not the most lucrative thing I do.
It's a definite loss leader.
But it's sort of for now anyway.
But I think that there is a hopeful.
I would imagine people would think
if she's going to do this,
I know it's going to be good.
And I get a lot of feedback on the sales
people saying,
I've never bought sauce in my life,
but I am curious.
Or it's people that were like me
ten years ago
cooking from dining in, cooking from,
you know, nothing fancy.
Well, eight years ago.
But you know, and thought to themselves,
well, I'll never make to
I'll never buy tomato sauce
because I make my own.
And now their lives have changed
and their perspectives are different.
And they're like, you know what?
I might buy a tomato sauce.
How are you thinking about distribution?
Because as Joe mentioned in the intro,
one thing we've learned from conversations
with different food and drinks
and snack companies is like,
you kind of live and die by the shelf
space that you get.
Oh yeah, and my level maybe. Okay.
And then also like, which comes first,
is it a distribution
agreement
or the actual scaling of the operation?
This is exactly where I'm at right now.
I'm like in the thick
of these conversations
of trying to figure that out,
because do I find a new co-packer
that can meet the needs
of potentially being and Whole Foods?
Well, then, without a Whole Foods
contract, I'm sitting on
hundreds
of thousands of dollars of product.
And where does that product go then? I'm
paying for storage for that product.
So how do you move that
without having that deal in place?
You also, I would imagine Whole Foods
is not going to give you something
unless they know for certain
that you can produce it.
And I'm assuming
they want some proof of concept.
But right now I'm, I'm it's very chicken
or the egg and I'm sort of like,
okay, what has to happen first?
Is it the the person who's going to get me
that relationship with Whole Foods?
Is it the co-packer that I know
can fulfill
and execute at the level that I want?
And, you know, these questions
are being asked and answered very quickly.
And, you know, next,
if we had done this meeting next week,
I probably would have a better answer
for you to come back into it.
Yeah, I guess. We just do a quick follow.
Well, it's so funny.
I'm sure anyone listening to this
that does know a lot about CPGs is like,
this woman has no idea,
but I believe that's part of my charm
and I kind of jump into everything
that I do like really curious and excited.
And I actually think that there's
a lot of benefit to not knowing,
because I think
getting hung up on how things are done
and what is the norm kind of limits
you. Are.
You just like surrounded right now
by like food industry execs
that are promising they can take
your business to the next level.
Maybe they did a stint at Whole Foods
or something like that and like, hire me.
We can. There's a few more.
There's a few.
There's yes,
the inbox is very busy right now.
And I will say primarily women,
which is really encouraging.
And yeah, I think there's always somebody
that's like, I can help you.
And then some people that are like,
I want skin in the game.
Some people are like,
I want to help you find the money
so that I can have skin
in the game in the future.
And I think that these companies
become so hot
and then often plateau or crash or people
don't care anymore.
Protein's no longer a thing.
Nobody wants to drink this type of thing.
But to me, I am such a legacy brand person
and I believe so firmly in
well-made products that are built to last
that never go out of style.
And to me, this is that.
And I'd rather be successful
over a really long term
than like a flash in the pan
or like hot right now.
And then note next year
nobody cares and then I'm f******.
Yeah.
Tomato sauce is definitely windy, I think.
Yeah.
Do you know, I Lindy, I don't know.
Oh, I've heard it not four times.
No, but I, it's sort of a non joke. Yeah.
It just means
it means it's lasted a long time.
And therefore one can infer
that it will last a long time.
Okay. I love it.
I'm going to adopt that word
and my patches.
It's it's a good word to use.
What's
been the most challenging aspect
of building this business?
Because, you know, you're talking about
a bunch of different things all at once.
There's the financing,
there's distribution, there's logistics,
there's actually making the product,
branding, all of that.
I will say I sort of
did everything that was easiest first,
which was developing the recipe,
figuring out the label, like the creative,
fun stuff that I feel qualified to
to weigh in on an execute.
And now we're at the hard part
where it's like,
okay, we've made the sauce, we've sold it.
People love it.
Okay, that feels like the hard part
for a lot of people.
For me, that was the easy part.
And now, you know,
I was saying to someone the other day,
like, what I'm really craving
as an adult in the room,
and I need a boss in this venture,
you know what I mean?
Like, I I'm so okay, I have the sauce.
It's it looks great. It tastes great.
People want it.
How do what?
What now?
And I need somebody who knows
what they're doing to come into the room
and say, here are the here's
the order of operations, here's
how much that's going to cost.
Here's who's going to do that.
Like when you're starting a business
like this, there's nobody to tell you.
And so you do sort of feel
a little vulnerable to people
that are like, I can help you. Yeah.
And so it becomes sort of this personality
vetting and, and who's
who do we vibe with?
Who do you think understands you
that it doesn't just see dollar signs and
it's again built on trust and
like who's going to like really be in this
with you to best advise
what's best for you, the business owner
and also the product,
and not just sort of treat
you like a mouthpiece for a thing
that can make the money.
You know,
you mentioned like you have the luxury of
you're not betting your life on this
brand.
You have
you have your thriving media empire, etc..
And so you're in the position to self-fund
and so forth.
It occurs to me like, you know, again,
journalism is in such a difficult time,
but like,
you know, thinking back ten years ago,
like all these consumer brands
trying to build out a media side, we're
like, oh, we're going to hire the editor
in chief of Gillette, you know,
because we want to like,
build a whole series of blogs
that are implicitly about razors.
And so people can't wait to read.
Yeah.
This is like, right,
because they think this is going to be
the best marketing
is we'll just buy the media branded.
So it must be really nice to not like you
already have that part solved implicitly.
It seems so much easier to start with
this media thing that everybody loves,
but a lot of people love
and then like add on to these, yeah,
various products
that can be sold on top of that.
Yeah.
And I
would obviously
never call myself a celebrity,
but I think that's the appeal
of the celebrity brand
and why that is so appealing to people
when they're like, you know, a pop star
that launches a makeup brand and an actor
who launches lingerie.
It's like it's a built in excitement.
It's built in by it, you know?
And so I think for me, again,
I take that very seriously,
that responsibility very seriously.
But I it is great to know that most of it
seems like what the money goes towards,
in addition to hiring is marketing.
Because if you're just like a person
that's like, no one knows who you are,
you don't have any food background,
but you're like, I'm going to start a
insert blank here.
You know, company that is food.
Well, yeah.
If you come from the tech world,
if you come from the business world,
you're already a leg up on me
in a lot of ways.
But I'm a leg up on you in a lot of ways.
But one money unfortunately, trumps all.
So I feel like always sort of
at a disadvantage without that
as my thing in the back pocket,
because a lot of brands that begin,
they begin from a guy in a vest and
you know, and I don't have that.
Have you seen like
I think there are some memes about it
where or like jokes
where it's like some parody.
Some guys, you know, working at McKinsey.
And I realized I had to quit my job
and dedicate my life
to making the ultimate tortilla.
Yeah.
There's like all these tracks, like,
you see these on the label is like,
we were working 9 to 5 jobs
in New York City, and then we're like,
why can't we just make some dried
tomatoes?
Exactly. Like,
why isn't there a cream cheese for me?
Yeah. You're like, yeah.
I mean, if you have a dream, you know,
and I think that that is very inspiring
when you can have a job
that makes you so much money
and then you're like,
wait, this is soulless.
And actually I just want to, like,
make granola.
Sure. That's great.
I, I think that for me,
I've always sort of been the inverse
where I've dedicated my life to cooking
and food and like the whole act of it and
knowing that those thing like
no one gets into the restaurant business
to make money.
I started working in restaurants
when I was 19, making 750 an hour,
and I never once thought,
how will I make more money?
I just thought,
wow, this is great. I'm so happy.
I love cooking,
and so to end up here and be like,
okay, I can like put a small amount
towards this,
but we've sort of
reached the end of that road,
of the money that I was willing
to bet on it, and it was sort of like
I thought pretty low stakes.
I was like, I believe in the product,
I know it's going to sell.
And I did, and it was great.
And so now it's time to consider
what's next.
And how do you consider
what is a middle class small business?
Because it stands, it feels like it's only
extreme farmer's market mom and pop,
but nobody knows who you are
except if you live in the town or
$5 million debut at target.
I have a slightly random question,
but since we were talking food media,
I think this is actually come up
on the podcast before.
But like a long, long time ago,
why do I have to read 3000
words of people's life story
or like explaining what an onion is?
Before I get to the recipe online?
Well, originally the reason
that I think that where those complaints
originated from are is blog culture,
which predates sort of recipe database
like New York Times, cooking, etc.
because basically, in order
for those bloggers to get ad revenue,
the person had to scroll a certain amount.
They couldn't
just go to the page and click
because they wouldn't see the ad,
so the ad revenue couldn't support them.
That is,
I think like 90s sort of reasoning
for me
as a person who writes those things, it's
because I think people care
or it makes you a better cook
and I and it provides context
and riches to the story of the recipe.
That also said,
I often separate the text from the recipe,
so I write in such a way that often
like for my newsletter,
for example,
there's many, many words about something.
It could be a sweater or my baby,
or a tomato sauce,
and then you jump to the recipe,
which has like maybe
six sentences about like,
why you need to do
what I'm asking you to do
so you don't skip
it and mess up the recipe
and then the recipe,
but you can always jump to it.
So that also said, I always felt
very defensive of that complaint
because I'm a writer
and I part of what I do is writing.
And I also think
that's a huge part of my success because
people are, like, emotionally invested in
what I'm asking you to do
and also selling you something.
I'm like,
okay,
you might not want to make lentil soup,
but I'm going to write something
that is so compelling
that you're going to be like,
oh my God, I have to make this lentil soup
and that as part of my job.
And so I do respect that, though.
And interestingly enough, it's
one of my favorite things
to do when I'm writing actual cookbooks,
because you're limited to the page versus
the internet. You could write forever.
Most people don't have good editors
or editors at all.
I don't know an editor,
and one thing that I learned
while working in magazines
is you have to ask yourself, who cares?
And so if I find myself
blabbing on about something,
I think about that person being like,
why do I care about this?
And I have to justify it.
And oftentimes
I edit stuff out all the time,
or I'm like,
that's boring or stupid, or only
I think that's funny or that's too niche
or it doesn't need to be here.
I'm very cognizant of the fact
that if something is too long,
people's eyes glaze over.
They don't care.
They are going to lose interest.
So you really fight for every word.
That's especially true in a cookbook
because you have to keep it
to a certain length,
otherwise it doesn't get printed.
And, you know, there's a lot
that goes into that for me anyway.
And I think each person that writes
recipes or whatever in the food world
will have a different answer.
That's mine.
Joe. Technology
has actually solved this problem for me
because there's there's
a really great app called paprika.
And you just like paste
in the URL of a recipe, people's
I know people, I know that.
You know, that that is like
the utility user and like that.
I'd rather you do that than like just
go on AI to like be like, right, right.
What you know, recipe with that?
Oh, I. Didn't
even think about I did, I just know.
Now you just put. That I know.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Really.
How often do you cook?
I cook like, all the time on the weekends.
And I don't cook in New York
because I have a tiny New York kitchen.
I have a big kitchen in Connecticut
where I can do, like, whatever I dream.
Yeah.
Do you find yourself
reading cookbooks for pleasure ever?
Yeah,
sometimes I have an expansive collection.
And I just ordered.
What's that food book?
It's like, how to eat a wolf or something.
Have you ever heard of that? No.
Apparently it was written in World
War two, and it's all about, like,
I guess, how to eat
frugally when there's, like, not so much.
So when I'm looking forward
to the. Rations.
How to cook a wolf by MFK. How to cook.
Yes. Yeah.
Of course. Sorry,
I thought it was more contemporary.
Okay, so like I do,
I do read some food stuff, but it's
when I'm actually cooking,
having to scroll is really difficult
because like your hands are covered
in like flour or sauce or whatever,
and I just find it distracting.
You'll be
pleased to know that on my website,
there's a tab at the beginning
that says jump to recipe,
and you can always just click on it
and skip all the text.
I should have said,
I have your book, by the way.
The fancy one.
Nothing fancy. Yeah.
Speaking of AI and cooking etc.
you know, like all media is fake.
I'm perhaps even you, but like all media,
is very anxious about the presence
of AI for various reasons and people were
and how they're going to navigate it.
Like traditional food media.
Like obviously
you have an issue of a name.
People really like reading your stuff.
Like, how are you feeling about the
what's the broader landscape
look like these days, or what's
interesting in the broader landscape?
I think the broader landscape,
and we're noticing this in TV
and also in news that our culture,
both in fashion, food, cultural criticism,
politics, we're sort of
going back to what we ran from.
So it's like the streamers are bundling
and you can watch all that.
Oh, wait, that's cable, right?
And then
so now the newsletter people are sort of,
gaining employees and
learning how to bundle their situation
and saying, well, I've deflected
and now we're starting a co-op
cooperative.
I'm like, well, that's a magazine.
And so it's so fascinating to me.
And I think any of us that are old enough
to have seen, you know,
lived through the various cycles of media
and, and
everything is returning to itself.
And, you know,
I'm sure they'll disband again
and it'll become more
about the individual.
And now it's,
you know, coming back to magazines.
So, you know, the movement,
the tomato sauce,
maybe it's like a little bit of a,
a difference between your old self.
Or maybe you would have looked down on
that when you think, okay, tomato sauce.
Like,
another very hot button thing in the news
was a big viral New York Times article,
a couple of days ago about people spending
crazy amounts of money on DoorDash.
And then people love to sneer
at people for.
Crazy, though,
because some people just love no one.
The world like some,
like someone was spending seven.
Hundred dollars on a in a week for him
and has has been, I believe.
Right. Yeah. That's a lot. Yeah. Wait,
how much did you say?
I think it was seven.
Yeah.
Yeah they were, it was, you know,
it was a couple and like they spent.
Wait what were they buying.
Do you remember
like what were they get it.
All I know is that if my husband
and I order from our favorite restaurant,
which is down the street, embarrassingly
enough, sometimes we do pick up.
But if we're getting it delivered, yeah,
that can be upwards of 100 plus dollars.
It is. Expensive.
And so let's say you're ordering
from a more expensive place
and you're doing it seven nights a week.
Yeah, $700 plus it really
I could see how you got there.
The thing that I think also set
people off is the guy in the photo
had these really nice copper pans.
I know. Stuff like that.
So for him, thousands of dollars
to check out your kitchen.
But apparently he was.
But would you ever,
you know, ten years from now
there's ever going to be an Ellison
Ramen like Ghost Kitchen or.
You know, that I've, I've been approached
so many times for that.
And I really say. More about. That.
What's the pitch when they bring. It to
the pitch is people
want high quality chef made food.
You have a name?
People would go crazy to have Alison
Roman's pasta made by Allison.
Yeah, but I'm not actually making that
for you or someone.
Tomato sauce.
But that I'm not claiming to. Okay, okay.
And and I think that there
is to me that that devalues
what I actually do. And
having tomato sauce
and then making something with that
tomato sauce feels very different to me.
I also understand
meeting people where they're at,
and if they're not going
to make tomato sauce from scratch,
at least
they're cooking something at home.
Even if it's opening a jar and adding
something to it and blah blah blah.
That to me is not a far cry,
but the the ghost kitchen,
the delivery, the the de.
It's to me very impersonal.
It freaks me out.
I, I don't care for it.
I think it's like a weird
licensing of your name
in a way
that feels really inauthentic to me.
You seen that, that thing wonder? Yes.
I find it. Really.
There's one near. Me.
I find it very creepy.
What is it?
So it's like. It's a sort of.
I think it's.
I don't totally know the business,
but I think it's basically trying to
roll up the DoorDash
and the restaurant at the same time,
so that they have this big facility that
can make 30 different kinds of cuisines,
and they have their own app,
and they have their own delivery drivers.
So basically just
I see vertically integrate the whole
supply chain, but they have this space on,
not Houston,
the one that starts with D down
on the Lower East Side, Lansing Delancey.
Thank you.
And on the outside
it says like a new kind of food hall.
And I was like, oh, I like food hall.
So I got walked in and there's just these,
kiosk green screens.
And on the screens
there's, like a Mexican option,
an Italian and a Chinese one at Japanese.
It's like you're at the airport.
Yeah, it's like you're at the airport
and then so there's a theory, 30
kinds of restaurants.
Oh, now
you guys are really selling it to me.
I know it's funny.
To me, that is literally my personal hell.
And I think also where they get you
is they tell you a small business owner
who's like a chef who has a restaurant,
my rent's going up,
I can't afford $20,000 in rent
because blah, blah, blah, DoorDash.
Okay.
So they come in and say,
we can give you the space, but
no one can really eat in your restaurant.
So you're basically cutting out the
entire reason for a restaurant to exist.
And there are so many restaurants
whose business is like 85% delivery,
and you walk in and they're empty,
but they're able to stay alive
because of delivery.
So if you take away that rent
and the need to staff
and did it, that's pretty appealing
to a small business owner.
And I think it's very predatory.
I think it's very sort of like we can help
you stay alive.
And it's like, well, at what cost?
Because you're then sort of, you know,
I don't know.
And some, some of these businesses
never start as a brick and mortar.
They are only an idea.
Or they do take big name chefs and say,
we can do like a fried chicken
concept with your name on it.
And when you look on DoorDash
or wonder or whatever,
it looks like a real restaurant. Yeah.
So you look like you think you're ordering
from a neighborhood restaurant, right?
But it's not a neighborhood restaurant.
I've done that before.
And then I like walked past
where they were actually making the food.
And I was like, wait a second.
Yeah, I've ordered from there.
Speaking of hell.
So one
of the things that has changed in food
media, over the years is
I think the emphasis on esthetics.
Right?
So I, I think everyone probably does less.
I certainly am guilty.
But if I make something that I'm proud of,
I take a photo of it,
post it on social media.
I didn't cook it. Otherwise
I didn't cook it.
There's no proof.
How do you think about that
particular aspect when you're coming up
with recipes or, you know, deciding
what to do with your food empire?
Yeah.
It's funny,
I just wrote an article about this
for the newly relaunched
gourmet, magazine, which I don't know
if you guys heard about that
or what they're doing, but
the containers trademark for gourmet,
the old magazine, had last.
That. They let it lapse.
And so this group of people,
one of whom was a friend of mine,
took it
over and relaunched it
as a basically a website, a newsletter.
So very interesting thing
that they're doing
is a very different
tone of always very different vibe.
They it's sort of like pirates
that took over a ship and you're like,
oh, this is not the same gourmet.
But I think in a very fun and that's cool,
smart way.
Anyway, but I was thinking a lot
about this recently
because it feels like most people now,
especially on the internet,
are making food to look good.
They're reverse engineering
of what's going to look beautiful
and what's going to look great.
And this is going back to
I worked at BuzzFeed Food
for approximately eight months.
15 years ago, or ten years ago.
How long ago?
I don't know, I was too long ago, anyway,
but it was sort of like
I would watch them
in the way that they considered
what recipes to run
and what they would make videos out of.
And it was always like, well,
what has cheese
and what has cream and what has this?
And it was always reverse
engineered from a visual perspective.
And I think that we're still sort of in
that even if it's, you know,
a lady in her kitchen or a guy
in his kitchen with like a forward facing
iPhone and
I so I as a reaction to this,
I developed this recipe for milk cooking.
Sorry, pork cooked in milk, which is a
very old Italian restaurant recipe.
It's ugly as hell. It is just sinful.
It is beige and clumpy with milk curds and
soft looking and it's really disgusting.
But wow, does it taste good.
It's like truly incredible.
Some of the best tasting things
are just like a bowl of slop.
Are they look like it. Yeah.
And I think it was sort of, you know,
what about this food?
Like, are we going to make this food
on the internet anymore?
Like because I had considered what
what could I develop for this magazine
that I wouldn't develop for myself?
And I told my friend I was like, well,
I would never put this on my own, really,
because it's too ugly.
But also, I understand
that part of encouraging someone to eat
something is it has to look good,
and it also has to sound good.
So the writing has to be
there in the photo,
has to be there,
and everything works in conjunction.
But it was just an interesting exercise,
and I think that I said something
to the effect of like, we're we're not
developing recipes, we're designing them.
And I think that a lot of people
lead with esthetics
and what they think will perform
well versus thinking about it
is something like a soulful,
authentically created recipe.
Can we just, return a little bit
to the, tomato sauce?
But I'm curious,
you know, one another reason,
we like to talk about this
topic is because you get a snapshot
into the consumer and pricing
and all that, etc..
When did you conceive of this?
Like when when did this idea that you're
in launch it?
Tomato?
In 2023.
So like, okay,
so two and a half or three years later
when you look at cost of jars.
The glass jars,
when you look at ingredients or rent like
how is the math working out
relative to what it looked like in 2023.
And how volatile is
it still in terms of being able
to, you know, get a good price on the raw
ingredients, at a good price on jars,
a good price on shipping and stuff
like that.
Yeah,
that hasn't fluctuated too much. Okay.
Again, that's really a scale question.
So the reason why DDC doesn't quite work
for a business model in this way
with something like tomato sauce is
because jars are heavy,
jars of sauce are even heavier.
So you're shipping
will always be the thing that gets you.
And so there are you know, we looked into,
you know, we had a Co-packer
or a three PL in California
and we're like,
okay, so we're going to ship the sauce
from Brooklyn to L.A.
and then it's going to go out
to the rest of the
we're like, no, that's going to add
$1.50 per jar or whatever.
So you look at every consideration
okay, this might be slightly more
expensive here, but we're saving here.
So that's actually the better choice.
But again it's scale.
So we could be
jars could fluctuate within a few cents.
The packing materials
was something that we really considered
because jars cannot explode on their way
to you.
The better the packaging,
the more expensive the packaging.
And so we someone told me it was like,
they're like,
it feels like an old school election box.
We're like,
how am I going to break into this box?
She's like,
but all the jars arrived intact
and that was really important to us.
So we spent a little bit more money
on the packaging.
Wait,
how do you actually evaluate the jars?
Are you like tossing them around?
Are you shipped them? Yeah.
You send it to your parents,
you send it to yourself.
Here's a bunch of empty jars. Enjoy.
No, you put the sauce.
Yeah.
You, you there's like a lot of,
like a few trial and error situations
and some of them are a set of choices
of like, oh, I don't like the way this is.
Or how does it feel to open it?
Is it complicated, is annoying.
Is there too much
material? Does it feel wasteful?
All of those things were deeply,
deeply considered.
And then to say nothing of like,
do you put a card in there?
Do you put a note?
Does it come with the rip it like
the esthetic choices which also add cost?
And so,
you know, of course, that's why
the obvious choice
is to be sold in a store
because you're not dealing
with any of that.
And I think a lot of, to me, respectable
to see brands evolve into retail only.
But at first doing the to see model,
to like get people into it,
to get people hook, to get people
excited about a product, sort of.
Then you can show
those bigger retailers like,
look at all the people who already love
this product,
who are going to buy it in your store.
So are you like
maxed out capacity wise right now?
Are you like busting at the seams in terms
of how much you can move in a given week
or month. With tomatoes on? Yeah, yes.
That's great. Very much so.
And it's good.
And I think that the to me
the biggest drawback there is that
we launched in September.
And also the reason it took so long
is because I had a baby.
I was like about to
we were going to launch it and push it.
And then I became too close to the due
date,
which is good
because I went into labor a month early,
but it I can't imagine
having done that at the same time.
So thank God I put a pause on it.
I was like and we also redesigned
the labels like it was a good reset.
It was almost like a false start.
But anyway, we launched in September
and I had these beautiful photos taken
and like I had all these ideas
for campaign and marketing
and we sold out immediately
and I was like, okay, well,
maybe I'll do it the next week
once we're back in stock.
We kept selling out at such a clip
that I couldn't really ever talk about it.
So I feel like in a way
we haven't, like, fully even launched
with its full potential. Yeah.
That's interesting.
Alison Roman,
can you come back in six months or a year
and like,
you've had all of these conversations
that we could do a
to on what you've learned when.
You're,
when you get the Whole Foods contract?
I'd be super interested
what those discussions are actually like.
We want to hear about. Yeah, yeah.
What the other half of the mountain looks.
This is a perfect diary entry
of following a small business.
I really am love very, very start.
And I think it would be really fun
to come back if and when things change.
And this has been great.
I love talking about this stuff
and what a pleasure. Tracy.
That was a lot of fun. I don't know,
you've probably noticed this too.
We've probably talked about it.
You know, if you look at the business
section of the Apple Podcasts like best top
podcast list, it's like dominated by like
starting a business podcast, entrepreneurs.
Maybe we should pivot into
I love these conversations.
Maybe we should pivot into, you know,
diary of an entrepreneur type episodes.
They're really fun. You learn a lot.
You know what I want to do? Yeah.
The Odd Lots cooking show.
What should.
Let's do a cooking video. Yeah.
That would be great.
Well, get, a recipe from Allison,
and we'll cook it live.
And, Bart from Butterworth’s.
Yeah. These words and all the.
And, the Zeno's pizza guys.
Yeah, I could get on. Yeah.
This is actually our book idea,
because we never settled on a book
that you and I want to write together,
but we could just do a food.
One where in each recipe,
someone learn something
about the supply chain for that business.
That's a great idea.
If you're listening,
if you're out there in publishing
and you hear this up
and you hear this, hit us up.
That's right.
No, that was a fascinating conversation.
One thing I hadn't really considered
that much is the difficulty of deciding
when to scale before
you have that big distribution contract,
because, as Allison said, like,
it does feel like a chicken
and egg problem because you have to pitch
to the grocery store
or whatever, that you can actually produce
this stuff at scale.
And then you have to decide
whether you want to invest
at scale
in order to be able to make the pitch.
No skill seems just sort of brutal
in every respect, right?
If you raise VC money,
then you have a lot of money to pay back
before you ever see a dime of profit
yourself.
Same obviously for lending.
And that's probably
particularly hard for this.
And then just, you know, you have to get
into a new facility that, chicken.
I promise I'll say it. Definitely.
It clearly doesn't hurt
to have to be a celebrity, right?
She sort of was hesitant about the word,
but obviously a, a food celebrity.
And the other thing,
it didn't come up in the conversation,
but something that I thought about
right after it's
come up a little bit on our show is
she doesn't have to pay the Facebook tax.
Right?
Most companies that are in the CPG,
a big chunk of their money immediately
goes to Instagram ads marketing.
Yeah.
And when you own a distribution list,
you have a popular newsletter, etc.
that you could sell out or run
without having to spend, like create.
That's a well, as she said, like she
hasn't even really been advertising it.
Yeah, I know that's publicizing.
That's a huge. List.
And she's sold out. Yeah. It's crazy.
All right. Shall we leave it there?
Let's, let's leave it there.
