Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.
 I
 am


sorry
 I'm
 late.
 We
 were
 having
 a
 couple


technical
 difficulties,
 but
 we
 are
 live.


We
 are
 here


and
 it's
 time
 to
 start
 the
 show.
 All


right.
 So,
 it's
 an
 ugly
 day.
 It
 is
 an


ugly
 day
 that
 is
 continuing
 to
 be
 ugly


from
 yesterday.
 Now,
 yesterday
 was


pretty
 ugly.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 all
 of
 us
 kind


of
 expected
 a
 bit
 more
 pain
 because


there
 wasn't
 really
 that
 much
 of
 good


news
 yesterday.
 Definitely
 wasn't
 good


news
 after
 hours.
 There
 was
 no
 kind
 of


core
 near-term
 catalyst
 that
 you
 could


expect
 to
 have
 a
 a
 sort
 of
 reversal
 or


any
 meaningful
 reason
 for
 why
 the


pre-markets
 would
 go
 green.
 And
 that's


what
 we're
 seeing.
 S&P
 500
 down
 another


1%
 in
 the
 pre-markets,
 but
 the
 S&P
 is


not
 even
 really
 the
 story.
 I
 mean,


that's
 ugly.
 The
 real
 story
 this
 morning


is
 Bitcoin.
 The
 amount
 of
 liquidations,


margin
 calls,
 forced
 deleveraging
 that


has
 been
 happening
 over
 the
 past
 24


hours,
 I
 would
 imagine,
 is
 pretty


intense.
 We're
 going
 to
 get
 some
 numbers


soon
 on
 exactly
 how
 bad
 it
 is.
 $1.1


trillion
 in
 the
 past
 month
 has
 been


liquidated
 from
 crypto's
 market
 cap.
 And


obviously
 Bitcoin
 breaking
 some
 of these


core
 levels
 down
 below
 95,000
 is
 not


pretty
 and
 it's
 not
 good
 for
 any
 of
 the


crypto
 derivative
 plays
 like
 a
 micro


strategy,
 Coinbase,
 Robin
 Hood,
 etc.


Micro
 strategy
 right
 here
 by
 the
 way


down
 at
 1967
 down
 5%.
 There
 is
 a
 rumor


going
 on
 that
 I
 do
 not
 believe
 is
 true,


but
 nonetheless
 it
 is
 getting
 a
 lot
 of


headlines
 that
 Sailor
 sold
 some
 Bitcoin.


I
 think
 this
 is
 absolutely
 false.
 I


believe
 that
 Micro
 Strategy
 is


transferring
 Bitcoin
 into
 a
 different


custodian
 and
 that
 has
 been
 disclosed


and
 therefore
 people
 are
 saying
 that
 the


transfer
 of
 that
 means
 it's
 a
 sell.
 Uh
 I


do
 not
 think
 that's
 the
 case,
 but
 that


probably
 is
 contributing
 that
 that
 rumor


in
 and
 of
 itself
 to
 more
 people
 selling


Micro
 Strategy
 because
 as
 soon
 as
 you


say,
 "Oh,
 Sailor
 selling
 than
 I'm
 going


to
 sell."
 You
 know,
 that's
 probably


leading
 to
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 pain
 right


there.
 But
 Mic
 Strategy
 down
 about
 5.5%


after
 being
 down
 7%
 yesterday.
 Meta


below
 600,
 down
 2%.
 ESTs
 down
 four,


Nebius
 down
 seven,
 Cororeweave
 down
 six,


Irene
 down
 nine,
 Crowd
 Strike
 down
 two,


Oracle
 down
 to
 211,
 350
 to
 211,
 that


one's
 disgusting.
 Tesla
 was
 445
 2
 days


ago.
 Tesla
 is
 now
 383.
 Robin
 Hood,
 which


was
 140
 a
 couple
 days
 ago,
 114
 on
 Robin


Hood,
 that's
 down
 5%.
 Palanteer
 losing


172
 now
 at
 165.
 Nvidia
 is
 actually
 I


mean
 Nvidia
 is
 down
 3%
 which
 is
 ugly
 but


Nvidia
 is
 holding
 180s
 which
 I
 am


surprised
 about
 given
 it
 was
 testing


these
 levels
 yesterday
 and
 the
 fact
 that


it's
 actually
 holding
 it
 not
 the
 worst


in
 the
 world.
 They
 did
 get
 a
 couple
 of


upgrades
 this
 morning
 that
 we'll
 talk


about
 that
 are
 you
 know
 more
 endemic
 of


how
 Nvidia's
 earnings
 are
 going to
 go
 in


Q3
 which
 is
 the
 next
 big
 catalyst
 for


November
 19th
 but
 it's
 obviously
 an
 ugly


market.
 It's
 an
 ugly
 ugly
 market
 and


you're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 pain
 across
 the


board
 as
 that
 ugliness
 continues.
 So,


why
 is
 this
 happening
 and
 kind
 of
 what


am
 I
 thinking
 about
 today
 for
 how
 this


ends
 up
 playing
 out?
 So,
 I
 think
 we
 got


to
 go
 back
 to
 Friday
 and
 again,
 good


morning.
 Thank
 everybody
 for
 being
 here


and
 uh
 we
 are
 going
 to
 get
 started
 with


this
 show
 and
 see
 what
 we've
 got
 going


on.
 I
 think
 this
 goes
 back
 to
 Friday.


What
 happened
 on
 Friday?
 Friday,
 we


obviously
 had
 a
 very
 very
 ugly
 uh
 661


level
 on
 the
 S&P
 500.
 We're
 at
 665


and
 uh
 so
 we're
 very
 close
 to
 that


level,
 right?
 We
 reversed
 from
 661
 to


672
 yesterday
 or
 not
 yesterday,
 last


Friday
 because
 of
 one
 headline
 and
 that


headline
 was
 the
 shutdown.
 The


shutdown's
 over.
 The
 government
 is


reopen
 and
 we
 are
 almost
 testing
 the


same
 levels
 that
 we
 were
 at
 last
 Friday


when
 we
 did
 a
 full
 literal
 V-shaped


reversal.
 Um,
 why
 is
 that
 happening?


Well,
 I
 think
 there's
 three
 reasons.


Number
 one
 is
 the
 no
 data
 transparency


from
 October.
 We
 talked
 about
 that


yesterday.
 Not
 getting
 any
 CPI
 or
 job


numbers.
 I
 mean
 even
 if
 they
 were
 bad
 I


think
 it'd
 be
 better
 to
 get
 those


numbers
 versus
 not
 get
 those
 numbers.


Two
 is
 crypto
 deleveraging
 that's


probably
 having
 a
 problem
 in
 the
 entire


uh
 ecosystem
 around
 risk
 on
 assets.
 And


then
 three
 is
 this
 AI
 capex
 trade
 fears.


I
 think
 the
 number
 one
 question
 to
 ask


for
 yourself
 especially
 if
 you're
 kind


of
 trying
 to
 make
 a
 proclamation
 on
 if


you
 sell
 hold
 by
 um
 or
 navigate
 your


portfolio
 in
 any
 way
 hedge
 sell
 calls


etc.
 is
 do
 you
 think
 these
 problems
 are


structural
 or
 do
 you
 think
 these


problems
 are
 idiosyncratic?


And
 and
 I
 and
 I
 think
 an
 example
 is


crypto
 deleveraging.
 Is
 that
 a


structural
 problem
 in
 the
 economy
 or
 in


crypto?
 I
 mean,
 not
 really.
 We've
 seen


crypto
 deleveraging
 happen
 all
 the
 time.


And
 when
 it
 happens,
 you
 get
 a
 flush


out.
 You
 get,
 you
 know,
 people
 that


liquidate
 and
 they
 lose
 a
 lot
 of
 money


either
 long
 or
 short
 and
 then
 crypto


goes
 back
 to
 being
 crypto
 because


there's
 a
 reason
 people
 want
 to
 bid
 up


that
 market.
 So
 like
 that
 to
 me
 is


rather
 idiosyncratic.
 It
 can
 be
 an
 ugly


deleveraging
 cycle,
 but
 that's
 not
 a


structural
 reason
 why
 I
 think
 the


economy
 would
 get
 hit.
 AI
 capex
 trade


fears.
 This
 is
 you're
 either
 a
 bull
 or


bear
 on
 the
 overall
 AI
 trade.
 I
 tend
 to


be
 more
 bullish.
 So
 to
 me,
 and
 we're


going to
 look
 at
 some
 of
 the
 Nvidia


upgrades
 that
 came
 out
 this
 morning.
 I


mean,
 you
 got
 Morgan
 Stanley
 saying
 we


think
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 hell
 of
 a


quarter.
 They're
 going to
 beat
 analyst


expectations
 by
 a
 lot.
 We
 have
 to
 raise


our
 estimates
 by
 70
 to
 80
 billion


overall
 for
 the
 business
 and
 we
 are


upgrading
 our
 price
 to
 I
 think
 around


220.
 There's
 another
 firm
 that
 did
 265


simply
 because
 they
 think
 the
 demand
 is


massively
 outstripping
 the
 supply
 which


is
 good
 for
 all
 the
 neoclouds.
 It's
 good


for
 all
 the
 hypersklls.
 It's
 obviously


good
 for
 the
 AMDs,
 Oracles,
 Broadcoms,


etc.
 Or
 you
 think
 all
 of
 its
 BS
 and
 AI


capex
 is
 not
 real
 and
 therefore
 the


market
 has
 a
 structural
 problem
 because


there
 there
 was
 never
 a
 reason
 for
 the


markets
 to
 get
 these
 valuations
 in
 the


first
 place.
 Right?
 That
 that
 that's
 a


subjective
 decision
 that
 everyone
 has
 to


make.
 Um
 crypto
 deleveraging
 to
 me
 is


more
 idiosyncratic
 than
 structural.
 AI


capex
 trade
 that
 is
 either
 you
 believe


it's
 structural
 or
 you
 believe
 it's
 not


and
 you
 know
 people
 have
 to
 make
 their


own
 decision
 there.
 The
 no
 data


transparency
 from
 October
 that
 is
 where


this
 can
 begin
 to
 be
 structural
 if
 we're


being
 honest.
 And
 what
 do
 I
 mean
 by


that?
 Well,
 we
 don't
 have
 the
 data.
 We


don't
 know
 how
 many
 jobs
 we
 got
 in


October
 or
 we
 lost
 in
 October.
 We
 have


third
 party
 pieces
 of
 data
 but
 nothing


from
 the
 Bureau
 of
 Labor
 Statistics.
 If


that
 data
 is
 bad
 and
 that
 data
 continues


to
 be
 bad,
 which
 could
 be
 the
 reason


that
 they're
 not
 releasing
 it,
 uh
 that


could
 create
 a
 structural
 reason
 for
 why


you
 think
 the
 markets
 can
 continue
 to


sell
 off.
 Now,
 having
 said
 that,
 the


data
 could
 be
 bad
 and
 the
 market
 could


price
 it
 in
 and
 say,
 "Okay,
 we're
 not


going
 to
 use
 this
 data
 as
 a
 like
 reason


for
 why
 we're
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 sell


off
 and
 you
 know,
 they
 outweigh


something
 else
 that
 allows
 the
 market
 to


continue
 going
 higher."
 But
 I
 think
 that


out
 of
 the
 three
 out
 of
 the
 AI
 capex


rate
 out
 of
 cryptog
 leveraging
 that
 lack


of
 data
 or
 the
 potential
 um
 downside
 to


that
 data
 aka
 the
 data
 being
 so


horrendous
 that
 like
 the
 markets
 just


can't
 handle
 it.
 That
 could
 be


structural.
 Is
 it
 idiosyncratic?
 We


don't
 know.
 I
 mean
 we
 don't
 have
 the


data.
 So
 time
 will
 tell
 there
 but
 that


is
 what
 I
 think
 the
 market's
 struggling


with.
 And
 and
 the
 question
 for
 today
 is


what
 headline
 can
 actually
 reverse


everything
 like
 we
 reversed
 on
 Friday.


Someone
 says
 Trump
 will
 step
 in.
 Well,


here's
 the
 question.
 Will
 Trump
 actually


step
 in
 today
 if
 he
 thinks
 it
 gets
 bad


enough?
 I
 mean,
 if
 we
 fall
 to
 S&P
 650,


which
 I
 mean,
 let's
 just
 do
 the
 math


real
 quick.
 S&P
 661
 would
 be
 Friday


numbers.


Um,
 yeah,
 basically
 basically
 a
 2%
 down


day,
 which
 it
 was
 basically
 a
 2%
 down


day
 yesterday,
 right?
 So,
 a
 2%
 down
 day


again
 would
 be
 650.
 The
 question
 then


becomes,
 does
 Trump
 think
 that's
 enough?


That
 would
 be
 almost
 6%
 down
 from
 the


highs.
 Is
 that
 enough
 to
 step
 in
 and


like
 say
 something?
 I
 don't
 know.
 Maybe


it
 is,
 maybe
 it's
 not.
 Maybe
 we
 never


get
 to
 those
 levels
 on
 Friday.


Obviously,
 the
 shutdown
 headline
 was
 the


reason
 why
 we
 reversed.
 Is
 there
 going


to
 be
 a
 need
 to
 uh
 for
 a
 reason
 to


reverse?
 Or
 will
 the
 reversal
 happen
 in


and
 of
 itself
 because
 people
 step
 in
 and


say,
 "These
 numbers
 are
 look
 starting
 to


look
 really
 stupid
 with
 valuations


getting
 very
 attractive,
 money
 that's
 on


the
 sidelines,
 7.54
 trillion.
 Do
 they


finally
 step
 in
 on
 a
 day
 like
 this?"
 Or


does
 Trump
 step
 in
 and
 say
 something?


And
 if
 he
 does
 step
 in,
 what
 can
 he
 say?


I
 don't
 really
 know
 if
 he
 can
 say
 much.


The
 only
 thing
 I'm
 guessing
 that
 he
 can


possibly
 say
 is
 something
 around


tariffs.
 And
 this
 right
 here
 is
 I
 think


the
 most
 damning
 story
 of
 the
 week.


Quite
 frankly,
 Democrat
 or
 Republican,
 I


think
 when
 you
 put
 two
 and
 two
 together,


you
 have
 to
 acknowledge
 this.
 The
 New


York
 Times
 reported
 yesterday
 that
 the


US
 is
 preparing
 some
 tariff
 exemptions


to
 lower
 food
 prices,
 including
 beef
 and


citrus
 products.


This
 is
 the
 Trump
 administration


literally
 admitting
 that
 tariffs
 are


increasing
 food
 prices.


I
 mean,
 I
 I
 I
 I
 if
 there's
 another
 way


to
 make
 sense
 of
 this,
 then
 please
 let


me
 know.
 But
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 people


right
 now
 saying,
 "Wait
 a
 second.
 I


thought
 the
 tariffs
 weren't
 supposed
 to


increase
 prices."
 I
 think
 also
 you've


got
 the
 market
 saying,
 "Oh,
 really?
 So


now
 we
 have
 to
 decrease
 tariffs."
 The


market
 never
 liked
 tariffs
 in
 the
 first


place.
 Remember,
 the
 only
 reason
 we
 had


that
 April
 10th
 rebound
 intraday
 S&P
 7%


move
 is
 because
 Trump
 said
 he's
 not


going
 to
 impose
 the
 reciprocal
 tariffs


that
 he
 said
 he
 would
 do.
 Like
 he
 took


away
 the
 tariffs
 in
 order
 to
 get
 the


markets
 to
 recover.
 This
 is
 kind
 of


what's
 happening
 right
 now.
 And
 so
 I


don't
 know
 the
 extent
 of
 how
 bad
 this
 is


going
 to
 be,
 but
 you've
 had
 many


interviews
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 days
 by


Vent
 Hasset
 Trump
 himself.
 Um,
 uh,
 uh,


uh,
 what's
 his
 name?
 JD
 Vance
 about
 the


idea
 of
 affordability
 and
 the
 core


argument
 they've
 made
 is
 that
 hey
 we


need
 to
 become
 more
 affordable
 and
 the


way
 to
 become
 more
 affordable


technically
 could
 be
 to
 an
 extent


reducing
 some
 of
 the
 tariffs.
 You've
 got


JD
 Vance
 right
 here
 yesterday
 admitting


the
 idea
 that
 the
 country
 is


unaffordable
 and
 as
 a
 result
 maybe


that's
 one
 thing
 Trump
 could
 say
 that


could
 get
 the
 market
 to
 be
 on
 board.


Also
 this
 is
 Trump
 admitting
 that


inflation
 is
 going
 higher
 which
 the


market
 is
 concerned
 about.
 Why
 is
 the


market
 concerned
 about
 inflation?
 Well,


the
 Fed
 said
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 Well,
 I


mean,
 they
 didn't
 say
 this,
 but
 they're


basically
 implying
 that
 they're
 not


going
 to
 cut
 rates
 in
 December
 because


of
 the
 fear
 of
 inflation.
 So,
 Trump


reducing
 some
 tariff
 exemptions
 on
 food


potentially
 could
 be
 getting
 grocery


prices
 down,
 which
 theoretically
 could


help
 decrease
 inflation.
 I
 mean,
 there's


a
 lot
 other
 tariffs
 that
 are
 out
 there.


So,
 he
 would
 have
 to
 have
 a
 more


dramatic
 impact
 to
 get
 the
 Fed
 on
 board.


But
 that
 could
 be
 something
 that
 gets


the
 market
 to
 say,
 "Oh,
 Trump's


reversing.
 That's
 bullish.
 We
 should
 buy


stocks
 because
 tariffs
 are
 going
 away.


Inflation
 expectations
 going
 down.
 Rate


cuts
 back
 on
 the
 table."
 which
 I
 could


see
 playing
 out.
 The
 question
 is
 how
 bad


does
 it
 have
 to
 get
 for
 Trump
 to


literally
 explicitly
 say
 I'm
 reducing


the
 tariffs.
 I
 don't
 know.
 And
 we
 would


have
 to
 see
 kind
 of
 how
 that
 plays
 out


today.


>> I
 know
 that
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 people


out
 there,
 Sean,
 who
 are
 saying
 things


are
 expensive.
 And
 we
 have
 to
 remember


they're
 expensive
 because
 we
 inherited


this
 terrible
 inflation
 crisis
 from
 the


Biden
 administration.
 But
 you've
 already


seen
 signs
 that
 things
 are
 getting


better.
 The
 price
 of
 eggs
 has
 gone
 way


down.
 the
 price
 of
 energy
 has
 gone
 way


down.
 The
 price
 of
 gasoline
 has
 gone
 way


down.
 And
 as
 we
 know,
 when
 the
 price
 of


energy
 goes
 down,
 that
 starts
 to
 filter


out
 into
 the
 entire
 economy.
 But
 that


all
 that
 also
 takes
 a
 little
 bit
 of


time.
 There's
 another
 component
 of
 this,


Sean,
 which
 to
 me
 is
 maybe
 the
 most


important
 because
 I
 care
 so
 much
 about


our
 young
 people
 being
 able
 to
 afford
 a


good
 life.
 A
 lot
 of
 young
 people
 are


saying
 housing
 is
 way
 too
 expensive.
 Why


is
 that?
 because
 we
 flooded
 the
 country


with
 30
 million
 illegal
 immigrants
 who


were
 taking
 houses
 that
 ought
 by
 right


go
 to
 American
 citizens
 and
 at
 the
 same


time
 we
 weren't
 building
 enough
 new


houses
 to
 begin
 with
 even
 for
 the


population
 that
 we
 had.
 So
 what
 we're


doing
 is
 trying
 to
 make
 it
 easier
 to


build
 houses
 trying
 to
 make
 it
 easier
 to


build
 factories
 and
 things
 like
 that
 so


that
 people
 have
 good
 jobs.
 We're
 also


get
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 about
 that


interview
 clip
 is
 that
 JD
 Vance
 is


talking
 about
 affordability.
 The
 New


York
 Times
 article
 last
 night,
 by
 the


way,
 that
 New
 York
 Times
 article
 came


out
 at
 605
 about
 the
 Trump


administration
 potentially
 taking
 away


tariffs,
 which
 would
 be
 an
 entire
 uh


argument
 around
 uh
 affordability,
 right,


to
 decrease
 food
 prices.
 The
 markets


actually
 were
 up.
 If
 you
 saw
 your


portfolio
 at
 605,
 as
 soon
 as
 that


headline
 came
 out,
 things
 started


reversing
 like
 very
 nicely.
 And
 then


Bitcoin
 crashed
 in
 the
 night
 and
 then


everything
 got
 hit.
 But
 like
 the
 market


obviously
 was
 reacting
 positively


towards
 that
 news.
 So,
 for
 those
 saying


Trump
 could
 step
 in
 today,
 which
 by
 the


way,
 again,
 the
 S&P
 500
 is,
 you
 know,
 he


stepped
 in
 at
 4,800.
 I
 mean,
 we're
 at


665.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 we're
 getting


anywhere
 near
 those
 levels
 today.
 Maybe


if
 it's
 another
 2%
 day
 we
 get
 to
 650,


but
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 would
 cause
 Trump


to
 step
 in.
 My
 only
 speculation
 is
 that


if
 he
 does
 step
 in,
 it
 would
 be
 an


argument
 around
 tariff
 reductions


leading
 to
 the
 affordability
 argument,


which
 would
 lead
 to
 the
 market
 to
 be


happy
 about
 inflation
 expectations
 going


down.
 Other
 than
 that,
 I
 don't
 know
 what


he
 would
 say.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 Trump
 is


not
 taking
 questions
 over
 the
 past


couple
 days.
 Obviously,
 I
 think
 everyone


has
 seen
 the
 Epstein
 files
 or
 the


Epstein
 emails
 have
 been
 released
 and


it's
 not
 looking
 pretty.
 I
 mean,
 there's


a
 reason
 he's
 likely
 not
 taking


questions
 right
 now.
 There's
 been


multiple
 reports
 of
 him
 being
 in
 the


situation
 room
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how


to
 navigate
 this
 from
 a
 PR
 perspective.


So,
 you
 might
 just
 have
 a
 silent
 Trump


for
 a
 few
 days
 until
 the
 administration


figures
 out
 what
 they're
 doing
 with
 this


situation.
 And
 that
 could
 also
 lead
 to
 a


lack
 of
 him
 like
 publicly
 acknowledging


or
 saying
 anything.
 53%
 chance
 for
 a


rate
 cut
 in
 December.
 I
 really
 do
 think


this
 is
 the
 number
 one
 reason
 we
 have


been
 seeing
 the
 selloff
 over
 the
 past


week.
 Um


I
 I
 you
 know
 I
 know
 people
 want
 to
 say


the
 AI
 trade
 is
 blow
 blowing
 up.
 I
 I


just
 don't
 agree
 with
 that.
 Steve,


Chris,
 um
 Douggee
 and
 Austin
 I
 we
 we
 did


a
 podcast
 on
 Steve
 stream
 last
 night.
 I


do
 recommend
 people
 watching
 the
 latter


half
 of
 that
 show
 was
 pretty
 much


discussing
 this
 idea
 around
 hey
 like


what
 happens
 if
 GPU
 chip
 demand
 goes
 to


zero
 like
 what
 are
 the
 implications
 of


everything
 going
 on
 and
 like
 the
 core


takeaway
 is
 let's
 say
 chip
 demand
 were


to
 go
 to
 zero
 tomorrow
 okay
 Nvidian
 AMD


Broadcom
 all
 those
 names
 would
 suffer


the
 Neocloud
 would
 suffer
 yada
 yada
 but


the
 big
 tech
 companies
 would
 just
 have


massive
 amounts
 of
 capex
 going
 back
 into


free
 cash
 flow
 buying
 back
 their
 stock
 I


mean
 those
 companies
 would
 do


phenomenally
 well
 in
 the.com
 bubble
 that


wasn't
 the
 case
 first
 of
 all
 the
 Fed
 was


hiking
 in
 the
 dotcom
 bubble
 so
 people


comparing
 that
 to
 the
 macro
 cycle
 right


now
 when
 we're
 about
 to
 go
 into
 an


easing
 mode.
 Doesn't
 really
 make
 much


sense.
 Number
 two,
 you
 didn't
 have


companies
 having
 the
 types
 of
 free
 cash


flows
 that
 a
 Google
 Amazon
 meta
 has
 that


if
 they
 were
 to
 stop
 spending
 on
 this


massive
 capital
 expenditures,
 it
 would


just
 go
 back
 into
 the
 business,
 which


would
 be
 bullish
 for
 those
 stocks,
 even


if
 it's
 bearish
 for
 chips.
 That's
 the


worst
 case
 scenario.
 The
 base
 case


scenario
 is
 that
 chip
 demand
 does
 not
 go


to
 zero.
 And
 we're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of


reasons
 why
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 zero,
 aka


Nvidia
 and
 AMD
 earnings
 and
 analyst


estimates.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 if
 the
 cloud


businesses
 on
 all
 these
 hyperscalers
 are


growing
 because
 of
 the
 AI
 workload


demand
 they're
 getting,
 that
 AI
 workload


demand
 is
 intrinsically
 tied
 to
 the


number
 of
 chips
 they
 have
 in
 their
 data


centers
 to
 be
 able
 to
 supply
 the
 compute


for
 those
 AI
 workloads.
 Which
 means
 a


lot
 of
 these
 stocks
 that
 are
 getting
 hit


because
 the
 AI
 trade
 is
 dead.
 Like
 h
 how


can
 someone
 logically
 say
 that?
 I'm
 not


opposed
 to
 listening
 to
 that
 argument,


but
 like
 how
 do
 you
 logically
 say
 the
 AI


trade
 is
 dead
 when
 you're
 seeing
 Azure


grow
 by
 40%.
 The
 reason
 they're
 growing


is
 because
 someone
 is
 buying
 AI


workloads
 from
 their
 cloud.
 The
 reason


they're
 buying
 those
 AI
 workloads
 is


because
 someone
 is
 seeing
 the
 value
 in


AI
 in
 their
 business.
 And
 as
 a
 result
 of


that,
 Microsoft
 needs
 to
 give
 $19


billion
 to
 Nebas
 because
 they
 have
 way


more
 demand
 than
 supply.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 Nebas
 has
 a
 business
 model.
 So


there
 there's
 a
 variety
 of
 layers
 here


that
 I
 think
 make
 it
 very
 hard
 for
 me
 to


say
 the
 AI
 capex
 trade
 is
 over.
 I
 think


this
 is
 a
 lot
 more
 about
 uncertainty


around
 rate
 cuts
 in
 December.
 Maybe
 I'm


wrong,
 but
 overall,
 that's
 kind
 of
 how


I'm
 thinking
 of
 it.
 Morgan
 Stanley
 today


expects
 Nvidia
 to
 post
 its
 strongest


quarter
 in
 a
 while
 as
 well
 as
 as


Blackwell
 chips
 ramp
 fast.
 Um
 analyst


acknowledges
 that
 Nvidia's
 trade
 other


has
 trailed
 other
 AI
 names
 but
 Blackwell


remains
 the
 top
 chip
 in
 demand


especially
 for
 Ver
 Rubin
 is
 very
 strong.


Industry
 checks
 and
 now
 show
 a
 clear


acceleration
 after
 earlier
 bottlenecks


were
 fixed.
 CEO
 Jensen
 Wong
 sgested


revenue
 estimates
 need
 to
 rise
 by
 70
 to


80
 billion.
 Morgan
 Stanley
 boosted
 its


forecast
 but
 notes
 Nvidia
 stock
 is
 still


about
 10%
 below
 where
 it
 traded
 after


his
 comments.
 So
 you
 got
 Morgan
 Stanley


saying,
 "Dude,
 we
 think
 Jensen's
 going


to
 absolutely
 wipe
 out
 the
 quarter
 and


we
 think
 that
 we
 need
 to
 increase
 our


expectations
 on
 Nvidia,
 signaling
 that


the
 AI
 capex
 trade
 again
 to
 me
 is
 not


really
 over."
 Key
 Bank
 raised
 their


price
 target
 to
 250
 today.
 Same
 exact


argument.
 They
 think
 hopper
 production


is
 increasing.
 You
 have
 more
 tailwinds.


Nvidia
 has
 resolved
 some
 of
 their
 supply


chain
 bottlenecks
 in
 regards
 to
 servers.


And
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that,
 they
 believe


demand
 continues
 to
 outstrip
 supply,


which
 is
 bullish
 for
 Nvidia.


So
 again,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 think
 the
 AI


trade
 is
 over,
 that
 is
 fine.
 We
 just
 saw


big
 tech
 earnings,
 and
 the
 AI
 trade
 to


me
 was
 not
 over.
 The
 one
 hiccup
 I
 think


across
 all
 those
 earnings,
 which
 we


didn't
 get
 Oracle
 earnings
 yet,
 but
 the


the
 sort
 of
 big
 issue
 over
 the
 past
 week


has
 been
 Oracle's
 uh
 bond
 issuance,


which
 yeah,
 that
 I
 I
 definitely
 think


the
 market
 should
 be
 concerned
 about


because
 when
 you're
 issuing
 all
 this


debt
 to
 be
 able
 to
 fund
 everything,
 that


gives
 flashbacks
 of
 times
 when
 things


have
 been
 ugly.
 The
 question
 is
 to
 what


extent
 is
 the
 debt
 issuance
 as
 a


percentage
 of
 the
 overall
 capex
 being


spent
 and
 right
 now
 it's
 very
 low.
 If


that
 continues
 to
 increase
 I
 guess
 the


market
 will
 continue
 to
 be
 scared
 but


again
 if
 that
 debt
 issuance
 results
 in


an
 eventual
 ROI
 on
 all
 the
 capex
 that
 is


being
 built
 out
 which
 maybe
 the
 market's


skeptical
 about
 right
 now
 but
 if
 you


think
 that
 entire
 thesis
 is
 broken
 then


you
 know
 then
 you
 get
 out
 of
 the
 AI


trade.
 If
 you
 don't
 then
 eventually


these
 become
 dips
 even
 if
 they
 are
 not


at
 the
 most
 attractive
 levels
 at
 this


moment.


So
 that's
 kind
 of
 how
 I'm
 thinking
 about


it.
 I
 do
 not
 think
 this
 is
 about
 AI.
 I


really
 do
 to
 an
 extent
 it's
 about
 AI


obviously.
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 stocks


that
 are
 down
 like
 a
 Palanteer,
 which
 is


an
 AI
 trade,
 like
 a
 corewave,
 they
 are


still
 up
 a
 lot
 for
 the
 year.
 So
 they're


getting
 the
 win
 taken
 out
 of
 their


premium
 multiple,
 but
 they
 are
 not,
 you


know,
 going
 red
 for
 the
 year.
 Whereas


then
 you
 have
 a
 Meta
 that
 actually,
 you


know,
 [laughter]
 as
 is
 one
 of
 the
 best


companies
 in
 the
 world
 going
 red
 for
 the


year.
 So
 it
 it's
 just
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 say


Meta
 at
 599
 is
 the
 top
 of
 the
 market.


It's
 it's
 it's
 difficult
 to
 to
 make
 that


argument
 given
 the
 earnings
 multiple


that
 it's
 trading
 at.
 Um
 but
 obviously


there
 is
 the
 fear
 of
 that
 AI
 trade.
 I
 I


am
 leaning
 more
 towards
 this
 is
 a


broader
 problem
 right
 now
 with
 the
 lack


of
 data
 transparency.
 And
 I
 also
 I
 also


wonder
 how
 the
 market's
 going
 to
 open.


We
 got
 about
 20
 minutes
 until
 the
 market


opens.
 I
 mean
 again
 pre-markets
 are


pre-markets.
 When
 the
 market
 opens,
 I


want
 to
 see
 does
 the
 bottom
 fall
 out?


Does
 do
 people
 just
 say,
 you
 know
 what,


we're
 done.
 This
 is
 completely
 over
 and


we
 are
 getting
 the
 hell
 out.
 Or
 do


people
 step
 in
 and
 say
 these
 are


absolutely
 ridiculous
 levels
 and
 we
 are


going
 to
 start
 beginning
 to
 buy.
 Here's


US
 trade
 representative
 uh
 Jameson


Greer.
 He
 was
 just
 live
 about
 20
 minutes


ago.
 Uh
 looks
 like
 he's
 announcing
 a
 new


trade
 deal.
 Market
 doesn't
 care
 about


it,
 but
 here's
 what
 he
 had
 to
 say
 about


Switzerland.


>> Where
 do
 the
 things
 kind
 of
 stand
 in


terms
 of
 the
 uh
 who's
 on
 deck?
 Sure.
 So,


so
 Switzerland
 is
 is
 probably
 the
 next


one.
 Uh
 I
 just
 met
 with
 them
 yesterday


afternoon.
 I've
 spoken
 with
 the


president
 just
 this
 morning
 and


yesterday.
 I've
 coordinated
 with,
 you


know,
 cabinet
 colleagues,
 Secretary


Lenick,
 Secretary
 Besson,
 the
 chief
 of


staff.
 And
 this
 is
 something
 where
 uh


we've
 essentially
 reached
 a
 deal
 uh
 with


Switzerland.
 So,
 we'll
 post
 details
 of


that
 today
 uh
 on
 the
 White
 House
 website


uh
 where
 they're
 going
 to,
 you
 know,


send
 a
 lot
 of their
 manufacturing
 here


to
 the
 United
 States,
 you
 know,


pharmaceuticals,
 gold
 smelting,
 uh
 you


know,
 railway
 equipment.
 Uh,
 so
 we're


really
 excited
 about
 that
 deal
 and
 what


it
 means
 for
 American
 manufacturing.


>> How
 how
 long
 was
 that
 deal
 in
 the
 works


and
 and
 what
 kind
 of
 pushed
 it
 over
 the


top?


>> Well,
 I
 it's
 really
 been
 in
 the
 works


since
 uh
 since
 April
 uh
 when
 the


president
 started
 his
 reciprocal
 trade


program.
 Switzerland,
 like
 dozens
 of


other
 countries,
 have
 been
 extremely


interested
 in
 having
 market
 opening


deals
 with
 the
 United
 States
 where
 they


open
 their
 markets
 to
 us
 uh
 and
 we,
 you


know,
 modify
 the
 reciprocal
 tariff


somewhat
 for
 them.
 Like
 all
 of
 the


president's
 deals,
 we
 keep
 a
 tariff.
 We


retain
 a
 tariff
 on
 these
 countries


because
 we
 have
 to
 get
 the
 trade
 deficit


under
 control.
 But
 because
 Switzerland,


for
 example,
 has
 agreed
 to
 manage
 its


trade
 surplus
 with
 the
 United
 States,


uh,
 in
 terms
 of
 making
 sure
 that,
 you


know,
 things
 where
 they
 have
 a
 surplus


with
 us,
 pharmaceuticals,
 gold,
 etc.


Their
 companies
 are
 going
 to
 build
 here.


So,
 it's
 going
 to
 eliminate
 some
 of
 the


sources
 of
 that
 surplus.
 I
 mean,
 we've


already
 seen,
 you
 know,
 RO
 has
 actually


broken
 ground
 already
 for
 a
 far


pharmaceutical
 facility
 in
 the
 United


States.
 It's
 really
 exciting.


>> Okay,
 so
 increased
 trade
 deals,
 good


market
 obviously
 on
 a
 day
 like
 this
 is


not
 going
 to
 care
 about
 it,
 but


uh
 you
 know
 the
 administration
 is


probably
 going
 to
 have
 to
 say
 some
 more


stuff
 that
 gives
 a
 lot
 more
 details
 to


how
 the
 market
 is
 thinking
 of
 what's


going
 on
 right
 here.
 What
 are
 people


thinking?
 So
 you
 guys
 know
 my
 thoughts.


My
 thoughts
 is
 I
 don't
 think
 this
 is
 an


AI
 capex
 trade
 dead
 fear
 selloff.


There's
 part
 of
 it
 involved
 in
 that.
 I


think
 this
 is
 more
 related
 to
 the
 labor


market
 and
 the
 lack
 of
 data.
 If
 people


had
 to
 summarize
 in
 a
 sentence
 why
 you


think
 we're
 going
 red
 right
 here,


what
 would
 you
 say?
 The
 broader
 question


is
 again,
 do
 you
 feel
 fundamentally
 the


market
 is
 changed
 in
 the
 past
 week,
 two


weeks,
 whatever
 time
 frame
 you
 want
 to


use
 from
 when
 we
 were
 not
 even
 at


alltime
 highs,
 but
 you
 know,
 2%
 higher


from
 here,
 which
 which
 was
 Monday
 to
 be


honest.
 Like


I
 mean
 for
 all
 the
 people
 saying
 a
 bare


market
 is
 starting,
 what
 happened
 in


those
 and
 I
 yes
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of


headlines,
 layoffs,
 all
 that
 stuff.


Those
 are
 arguments
 that
 can
 turn
 very


bearish.
 100%
 agreed.
 My
 question
 is


just
 is
 that
 enough
 def
 if
 Verizon


laying
 off
 15,000
 people,
 is
 that


definitive
 proof
 that
 a
 bare
 market
 has


started
 and
 we
 are
 into
 2022.


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to


easily
 go
 down
 that
 route.
 And
 if
 that


is
 the
 case,
 the
 question
 then
 becomes,


are
 you
 selling
 everything
 and
 are
 you


going
 net
 short?
 Because
 it
 I
 mean,
 it's


easy
 to
 say
 a
 bare
 market
 has
 started.


It's
 harder
 to
 say,
 well,
 I'm
 going
 to


get
 out
 of
 this
 market
 completely
 and
 go


to
 cash.
 Which
 look,
 when
 you
 have
 the


VIX
 that's
 up
 10%
 right
 here
 in
 the
 pre


when
 you
 have
 stuff
 like
 that
 happen,


we've
 seen
 that
 more
 often
 than
 not
 be


panic
 fear
 and
 panic
 selling,
 maybe


that's
 the
 best
 maybe
 that's
 the
 best


option
 of
 what
 to
 do
 today.
 The
 question


becomes
 again,
 what
 is
 that
 core


headline
 that
 you
 are
 looking
 at
 that
 is


just
 like,
 yep,
 this
 is
 it.
 I'm
 done.


I'm
 completely
 out.
 Bare
 market
 is


starting.
 I
 don't
 see
 that.
 I
 see


structural
 things
 that
 could
 lead
 to


that
 if
 the
 data
 continues
 to
 be
 as
 bad


and
 if
 you
 know
 you
 undermine
 and


discount
 all
 of
 the
 growth
 and
 capex
 and


AI
 and
 earnings
 etc
 etc.
 By
 the
 way,
 we


are
 in
 extreme
 fear
 right
 here.


But
 outside
 of
 those
 things,
 it
 doesn't


make
 the
 most
 sense
 to
 me
 to
 be
 like,


"Yep,
 bare
 market
 starting."
 Here's
 what


Tom
 Lee
 had
 to
 say
 this
 morning
 on
 how


some
 of
 this
 is
 playing
 out.
 you
 know
 it


is
 going
 to
 be
 from
 time
 to
 time
 going


to
 show
 extended
 weakness
 but
 to
 me
 the


underlying
 story
 driving
 technology


which
 is
 the
 productivity
 miracle
 coming


from
 AI
 is
 still
 intact.
 Uh
 Mary
 Erdos


even
 talked
 about
 this
 earlier
 this
 week


from
 JP
 Morgan
 that
 there's
 been
 a


payoff
 in
 spending
 and
 Lisa
 Sue
 at
 AMD


as
 well
 as
 noting
 that
 that
 productivity


lift
 is
 the
 reason
 AI
 spending
 is


rising.
 That's
 actually
 still
 a
 tailwind


for
 tech
 stocks.
 Tom,
 if
 I
 could
 just


follow
 up.
 You
 manage
 funds
 now,


especially
 an
 ETF
 that's
 heavily
 tilted


in
 some
 ways
 towards
 some
 parts
 of
 that


kind
 of
 technology,
 media,
 and
 telecom


trade.
 Has
 anything
 changed
 with
 regard


to
 the
 price
 action
 or
 the
 fundamentals


that
 have
 taken
 some
 of
 those
 names


perhaps
 out
 of
 your
 portfolios?


>> Uh,
 Dom,
 we
 just
 actually
 did
 a


rebalance
 for
 the
 Granny
 Shots
 ETF,
 uh,


our
 large
 cap
 fund.
 Uh,
 we
 still


actually
 have
 about
 40%
 exposure
 to


tech.
 It's
 it's
 about
 a
 market
 weight,


but
 to
 us
 the
 visibility
 and
 the


spending
 is
 still
 very
 strong.
 And
 names


like
 Nvidia
 are
 still
 reasonably
 priced.


I
 mean,
 Nvidia's
 at,
 you
 know,
 at
 28


times
 Ford
 earnings
 is
 still
 less


expensive
 than
 buying
 Walmart
 or
 Costco.


Costco's
 almost
 50
 times
 forward


earnings.


>> All
 right,
 Ross,
 with
 that
 in
 mind,
 as


you
 watch.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 I
 think
 it
 is
 uh
 helpful


to
 think
 about
 where
 we
 are
 in
 the
 in


the
 cycle.
 I
 know
 the
 Fed
 is
 a
 little


hesitant
 the
 reason
 to
 cut
 in
 December,


but
 the
 reason
 they're
 hesitant
 to
 cut


is
 the
 economy
 is
 actually
 pretty


healthy
 and
 they
 just
 don't
 have
 a
 clear


contour
 of
 how
 quickly
 inflation's


cooling.
 That's
 a
 very
 good
 backdrop
 for


corporate
 earnings
 actually
 even


corporate
 earnings
 to
 actually
 start
 to


spread.
 So
 if
 the
 Fed
 uh
 gives
 us
 some


guidance
 and
 visibility
 about
 you
 know


the
 path
 forward
 I
 do
 think
 business


confidence
 picks
 up
 that
 means
 that
 ISM


starts
 to
 recover
 and
 it
 is
 a
 broadening


trade.
 So,
 uh,
 I
 would
 agree
 with
 the


other
 speaker
 that,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 like


tech
 structurally
 because
 of
 AI


spending,
 but
 there's
 still
 plenty
 of


room
 for
 the
 small
 caps
 to
 work,
 which


have
 really
 taken
 it
 in
 the
 gut,
 as
 the


Feds
 sounded
 hawkish,
 and
 the
 banks.
 And


so,
 I'd
 be
 in
 sort
 of
 favor
 of
 a
 a


broadening
 trade
 as
 well.
 But
 I
 still


like
 tech,
 and
 as
 you
 know,
 the
 AI
 trade


comes
 under
 question
 every
 few
 months.


There's
 always
 a
 big
 pullback,
 but
 but


for
 the
 last
 five
 years,
 you
 investors


have
 had
 to
 buy
 that
 pullback.
 Ross,
 uh,


we'll
 give
 you
 the
 final
 word
 here.


>> People
 are
 saying
 Tom
 Lee
 this
 week
 made


him
 skinny.
 [laughter]


You
 can
 definitely
 tell
 he
 looks
 a
 bit


stressed.
 I
 mean,
 it's,
 uh,
 it's
 an
 ugly


day.
 You
 know,
 Tom
 manages
 billions
 and


billions
 of
 dollars.
 So,
 you
 know,
 when


you're
 dealing
 with
 that
 type
 of
 money


and
 you
 have
 a
 market
 draw
 down,


obviously
 it
 can
 get
 ugly
 and
 you
 can


lose
 some
 sleep.
 Bitcoin
 right
 there,


95,000.
 Ethereum.
 Ethereum
 somehow


holding
 above
 3,000.
 I
 mean,
 I
 know


Ethereum
 has
 got
 the
 wind
 knocked
 out
 of


it,
 but
 goodness,
 the
 fact
 that
 it's


somehow
 holding
 above
 3,000
 is
 quite


incredible.
 Um,
 but
 obviously
 that
 one


is


pretty
 much
 getting
 hit.
 So,
 look,
 it's


a
 ugly
 day,
 an
 ugly
 week,
 and
 I
 don't


really
 know
 what
 the
 remedy
 for
 this
 is


today,
 especially
 given
 it's
 a
 Friday,


you've
 got
 options
 expiring,
 etc.
 I
 will


say
 there's
 probably
 margin
 calls
 that


are
 being
 triggered
 as
 we
 speak.
 And
 for


people
 that
 are
 heavily
 using
 leverage,


I
 mean,
 look,
 you're
 they're
 going
 to


have
 to
 sell.
 Either
 they're
 going
 to


have
 to
 sell
 or
 the
 brokerages
 will
 sell


something
 for
 them.
 And
 until
 you
 get
 a


reversal
 in
 in
 any
 capacity,
 not
 even
 a


full
 reversal,
 just
 like
 just
 some
 level


of
 like
 stopping
 the
 bleeding,
 that


selling
 could
 continue.
 The
 question


here
 becomes,
 and
 again,
 we
 looked
 at


these
 macro
 stats
 a
 couple
 days
 ago,
 the


question
 here
 becomes,
 are
 the


institutions
 buying?
 And
 from
 what
 I


showed
 you
 guys
 from
 the
 Bank
 of
 America


research
 that
 last
 week,
 4.3
 billion
 of


ETF
 inflows
 came
 in.
 That
 was
 the


highest
 in
 a
 week
 since
 December
 2022.


Those
 were
 institutions.
 Those
 were
 not


retail.
 Those
 were
 not
 hedge
 funds.


Retail
 and
 hedge
 funds
 actually
 were
 net


sellers
 last
 week
 as
 of
 Bank
 of


America's
 Research.
 Institutional
 money


managers
 were
 net
 buyers.
 And
 then
 take


a
 look
 at
 this.
 As
 for
 Bloomberg
 ETF


flows
 yesterday,
 yesterday
 was
 also
 an


ugly
 day.
 11
 billion.


Good
 chunk
 of
 that
 was
 US
 equities.
 Some


of
 that
 was
 treasuries
 and
 then
 some
 of


that
 was
 gold.
 Those
 are
 the
 top
 10


ETFs.
 Uh
 on
 the
 screen
 right
 there
 you


have
 the
 Q's,
 S&P
 500,
 small
 caps,
 XBI,


that's
 the
 the
 biotech
 ETF
 is
 up
 there.


GLD
 for
 gold
 triple
 QQQ
 was
 up
 there.
 It


had
 245
 million.
 What
 DGens
 yesterday?


Which
 one
 of
 you
 guys
 bought
 Triple
 Q


and
 leveraged
 up
 on
 the
 NASDAQ?
 But
 like


you
 know
 it
 when
 you
 see
 11
 billion
 of


inflows
 come
 in
 yesterday


again
 like
 for
 for
 everyone
 screaming


it's
 a
 bare
 market.
 It's
 done.
 It's
 the


top.
 It's
 over.
 I'm
 like
 yes
 I


understand
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 fun


dopamine
 fulfilling
 thing
 to
 say
 around


calling
 the
 top
 and
 being
 bearish
 and


getting
 all
 the
 attention
 for
 being


negative
 and
 feeding
 on
 the
 negativity.


But
 just
 like
 the
 practicality
 of
 it
 to


me
 is
 in
 question.
 Especially
 with
 the


S&P
 500
 again
 a
 traditional
 bare
 market


is
 S&P
 500
 down
 20%.
 S&P
 year
 to
 date,


even
 with
 this
 draw
 down,
 I
 mean,
 it's


14%.
 If
 you
 want
 to
 call
 it
 12
 or
 13,


well,
 now
 it's
 15.
 So,
 yeah,
 we
 get
 13


13.5
 based
 on
 the
 the
 the
 pre-market


action,
 then
 okay.
 But
 that's
 not
 a
 bare


market.
 We
 could
 end
 the
 year
 at
 665
 on


the
 S&P
 and
 that
 would
 be
 a
 hell
 of
 a


year
 because
 we
 had
 two
 years
 back


toback
 of
 20
 and
 then
 we
 had
 one
 year
 of


13
 14%.


So
 again,
 the
 the the
 people
 that
 are


like
 this
 is
 just
 f
 and
 and and
 this
 is


just
 what
 I'm
 seeing
 on
 Twitter
 and


trying
 to
 like
 see
 the
 other


perspective.
 It's
 a
 lot
 more
 people


dunking
 that
 a
 stock
 is
 down
 and
 they're


happy
 to
 see
 the
 community
 that
 supports


that
 stock
 suffer
 versus
 people
 saying


I'm
 going
 net
 short.
 S&P
 is
 going
 back


to
 6,000
 and
 it's
 time
 to
 completely
 say


that
 this
 market
 is
 done.
 Because
 when


you
 look
 at
 the
 earnings
 growth,
 it
 is


really
 hard
 to
 make
 that
 argument
 and


say
 that
 uh
 that
 that
 is
 the
 case.
 Now


maybe
 that
 changes,
 but
 based
 on
 the


data
 we
 have
 available,


I
 think
 it's
 just
 hard
 to
 make
 that


argument.


Tess
 says
 they're
 literally
 stop
 loss


harvesting
 and
 pricing
 margin
 out
 and


buying
 cheaper.
 It's
 what
 you
 should
 be


doing.
 Yeah.
 No,
 I
 agree.
 I
 do
 think


that
 at
 a
 moment
 like
 this,
 this
 is
 when


margin,
 stop
 losses,
 etc.
 start
 to


really
 accumulate
 and
 and
 the
 and
 the


the
 velocity
 of
 that
 impact
 can
 get


aggressive.
 Like
 we
 even
 saw
 it


yesterday.
 We
 we
 I
 I
 mean
 we
 had
 a


little
 bit
 of
 an
 intraday
 reversal


yesterday,
 but
 I
 saw
 Nvidia
 go
 from
 like


187
 to
 182
 back
 to
 186
 within
 10


minutes.
 Like
 why
 did
 it
 go
 from
 187
 to


182?
 Because
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 probably


were
 getting
 margin
 called
 at
 the


moment,
 stop
 losses,
 all
 that
 was


getting
 and
 then
 it
 just
 reverses
 and


and
 it
 sucks
 when
 it
 reverses
 within
 a


couple
 minutes
 of
 you
 selling.
 But
 like


that
 is
 exactly
 how
 it
 plays
 out
 every


time.
 Now,
 if
 there's
 a
 more
 structural


problem,
 then
 obviously
 those
 losses
 can


can
 continue
 to
 get
 worse.
 But
 the
 point


is
 this
 stuff
 happens
 and
 being
 solvent


on
 a
 day
 like
 this,
 especially
 if
 you're


on
 leverage,


I
 think
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important


things.


Question
 is,
 is
 is
 the
 Santa
 rally
 still


intact?
 And
 yeah,
 again,
 I
 think
 that


really
 just
 depends
 on
 the
 data.
 I
 think


the
 worst
 case
 scenario
 for
 those
 that


want
 a
 worst
 case
 scenario,
 I
 I
 really


don't
 think
 it's
 about
 the
 AI
 trade
 at


all
 because
 just
 based
 on
 the
 earnings


I'm
 seeing,
 the
 demand
 is
 there.
 The


demand
 is
 outstripping
 the
 supply
 by
 a


wide
 margin
 and
 so
 that's
 not
 really
 the


concern
 of
 it
 blowing
 up.
 I
 I
 think
 the


worst
 case
 scenario
 is
 the
 labor
 market


data
 is
 very
 bad
 and
 the
 market
 is
 not


ready
 to
 uh
 discount


stocks
 enough
 based
 on
 underwriting
 how


bad
 the
 data
 market
 or
 the
 the
 the
 job


market
 is
 which
 is
 why
 they
 might
 not
 be


releasing
 the
 data.
 I
 mean
 like
 that
 is


your
 biggest
 bare
 case
 going
 into
 the


year
 that
 stops
 a
 Santa
 Claus
 rally
 and


that
 potentially
 stops
 a
 rate
 cut


although
 theoretically
 that
 would
 be


bullish
 for
 a
 rate
 cut
 if
 the
 data
 is


that
 bad.
 Um,
 but
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


the
 AI
 tree,
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 what


more
 people
 are
 thinking
 that
 could
 be


the
 case.


Ugly
 day.
 Ugly,
 ugly,
 ugly
 day.
 Let's


put
 the
 poll
 in
 the
 chat.
 Green
 or
 red?


What
 do
 we
 think
 is
 going
 to
 happen


today?
 Tell
 V
 to
 save
 us.
 I
 was
 talking


with
 him
 in the
 morning.
 I
 mean,
 all
 are


down
 pretty
 badly.
 TripleV
 runs
 a


billion
 dollar
 portfolio.
 So,
 it's


obviously
 not
 looking
 the
 best
 for
 him.


But,
 you
 know,
 we
 were
 talking
 in
 the


morning,
 he
 thinks
 it's
 a
 buying


opportunity
 [laughter]


like
 because
 again,
 you
 know,
 to
 put
 you


in
 his
 mind,
 he
 was
 just
 like,
 "Okay,


what's
 changed?"
 I
 was
 like,
 "Well,


nothing."
 He's
 like, "Okay,
 so
 like
 why


what
 are
 we
 talking
 about
 here?"
 It's


like,
 "All
 right,
 cool."
 Like,
 "What
 has


changed?"
 It's
 like,
 yeah,
 we
 have
 some


issues
 with
 data
 transparency
 and
 all


this
 stuff,
 but
 like
 fundamentally,
 what


has
 stopped
 this
 market
 from
 being
 the


way
 it
 is.


And
 if
 there's
 something
 that's
 not
 as,


you
 know,
 prevalent
 there,
 that's
 when


people
 end
 up
 buying
 the
 dip.
 So
 did
 get


added
 to
 Granny
 Shots.
 So
 for
 all
 the


SoFi
 bulls,
 Tom
 Lee
 did
 buy
 $98
 million


of
 SoFi.
 So
 that
 is
 now
 in
 the
 grainy


shots
 ETF


which
 is
 very
 exciting
 for
 SoFi
 as
 well.


But
 like
 SoFi
 right
 here
 is
 what
 27.


What
 has
 changed
 from
 SoFi
 at
 32?
 I
 mean


like
 in
 those
 $5,
 can
 you
 make
 a
 real


argument
 for
 why
 SoFi
 deserves
 to
 be
 up


or
 down?
 It's
 like
 I
 can't
 it's
 really


hard
 to
 make
 that
 argument
 outside
 of


it's
 going
 to
 go
 down
 with
 the
 entire


market


if
 the
 market
 gets
 hit.


Uh
 Quantum
 is
 taking
 a
 hit.
 Yes,
 a
 lot


of
 those
 high
 beta
 names
 are
 getting
 the


wind
 taken
 out
 of
 them
 at
 a
 at
 a
 bit
 of


a
 higher
 level.
 Dwave
 right
 there
 down


7%,
 NQ
 down
 5%,
 Regetti


down
 5%,
 nuclear
 Oakllo
 is
 down
 7%.
 I


mean
 again
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 names
 that


were
 very
 very
 high
 beta,
 those
 are


getting
 hit
 hard
 and
 so
 the
 this
 is


where
 you
 test
 your
 conviction,
 right?


Do
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 conviction
 in
 a
 NQ


enough
 to
 buy
 the
 dip
 here
 or
 was
 it


just
 a
 trade
 because
 of
 whatever
 reason


you
 bought
 in?
 But
 an
 Amazon
 that's
 also


down
 from
 like
 255


at
 237,
 does
 that
 look
 attractive
 here?


And
 you
 know,
 is
 it
 easier
 to
 hold
 an


Amazon
 versus
 one
 of
 those
 other
 names?


I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 decision-
 making


across
 the
 retail
 investor
 ecosystem


will
 be
 happening
 today
 as
 well


to
 get
 people
 to
 think
 why
 do
 they
 want


to
 be
 in
 these
 names
 in
 the
 first
 place.


But
 I'm
 curious.
 We
 got
 10
 minutes.
 I


mean,
 what?
 Let's
 ask
 this
 question.


When
 the
 market
 opens,
 what
 do
 you
 guys


think
 is
 the
 gut
 reaction?
 Put
 in
 the


chat.
 Up
 or
 down?
 I
 mean,
 obviously,


just
 looking
 at
 the
 price
 action,
 it


would
 feel
 like
 it's
 down.
 It
 would
 be
 a


major
 U-turn


if
 buyers
 step
 in
 immediately.


Or
 and
 the
 reason
 I
 say
 it's
 also
 is


down
 is
 because
 we
 I
 think
 we
 got
 to
 get


to
 Friday
 lows
 which
 is
 661
 about
 a
 half


a
 percent
 from
 here
 for
 really
 getting


the
 buyers
 to
 be
 interested
 like
 they


were
 on
 Friday.


So
 the
 panic
 margin
 calls
 stop
 losses


etc.


Maybe
 that's
 enough.
 It's
 kind
 of
 50/50.


Some
 of you
 guys
 saying
 down,
 some
 of


you
 guys
 saying
 up.


um


2pm
 reversal.
 See
 again
 but
 that
 2
 p.m.


even
 yesterday
 Trump
 was
 talking
 at
 2


p.m.
 an
 executive
 order
 but
 he
 didn't


take
 questions
 right
 he
 didn't
 give
 any


comments
 about
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the


markets
 nothing
 so
 it's
 like
 even
 if
 you


were
 to
 have
 some
 reversal
 my
 question


is
 what
 would
 be
 the
 reason
 for
 that


reversal


and
 there
 might
 not
 be
 enough
 of
 the


yeah
 amor
 is
 at
 29
 like
 amcore
 was
 at
 37


last
 week
 by
 the
 way
 this
 is
 my
 point


about
 how
 I
 don't
 just
 think
 this
 is
 the


AI
 trade
 amcor
 was
 at
 37
 last
 week


because
 it
 got
 a
 big
 upgrade
 to
 62
 and


even
 at
 37
 the
 reason
 we
 started
 talking


about
 amore
 is
 because
 it's
 a
 cheap
 name


in
 the
 semi
 ondctor
 space
 that's


virtually
 a
 monopoly.
 There's
 like
 three


other
 players
 that
 are
 with
 them
 in
 a


very
 hypersp
 specific
 role
 around


packaging
 for
 semiconductors


specifically
 in
 the
 TSMC
 Arizona
 region


that's
 helping
 Nvidia
 build
 their
 chips.


Um
 that
 was
 trading
 at
 onetime
 sales


when
 we
 brought
 it
 up.
 We
 brought
 it
 up


at
 2850
 29
 bucks
 got
 to
 37.
 It's
 not


like
 it
 was
 trading
 at
 50
 time
 sales
 as


you
 know
 it's
 a
 nice
 move
 but
 it's
 not
 a


crazy
 move.
 And
 now
 it's
 back
 down
 to


29.
 Nothing
 has
 changed.
 In
 fact,
 you


could
 only
 argue
 that
 demand
 is


increased
 based
 on
 all
 these
 updates


around
 AMD
 and
 Nvidia
 and
 then
 obviously


the
 upgrades
 that
 it
 got.
 So
 like
 why
 is


it
 back
 down
 to
 29?
 Well,
 it's
 back
 down


to
 29
 because
 it's
 going to
 fall
 with


the
 entire
 market.
 A
 lot
 of these
 names


are
 just
 going
 to
 go
 down
 with


everything.
 Some
 of
 these
 names
 going
 to


get
 hit
 worse
 like
 a
 Micro
 Strategy
 if


Bitcoin
 gets
 hit
 worse
 or
 just
 like
 a


super
 high
 beta
 name,
 but
 that
 that


doesn't
 mean
 the
 thesis
 has


fundamentally
 changed.
 And
 that's
 the


thing
 and
 and
 and
 just
 to
 give
 some


context
 going
 back
 to
 2022,


the
 thesis
 fundamentally
 changed
 on


everything
 for
 two
 reasons.
 Number
 one,


the
 most
 obvious
 rate
 hikes,
 right?
 That


changes
 everything.
 I
 mean,
 that
 changed


the
 thesis
 on
 Robin
 Hood
 instantly


because
 Robin
 Hood
 was
 a
 zero
 interest


rate
 phenomena
 at
 the
 time.
 The
 reason


people
 were
 signing
 up
 is
 because
 money


was
 cheap
 and
 they
 wanted
 to
 invest
 in


things,
 right?
 You
 hike
 rates,
 that


changes
 the
 thesis
 completely.
 For
 a
 lot


of
 these
 growth
 stocks,
 the
 cost
 the


cost
 of
 capital
 goes
 up
 like
 small
 caps.


And
 so
 there
 there's
 like
 all
 these


different
 implications
 of
 rates
 going


higher
 um
 which
 immediately
 changed
 the


thesis
 for
 everything.
 And
 then
 number


two
 was
 the
 deleveraging
 of
 the
 COVID


era
 buildout
 in
 employee
 workforce.
 So


for
 example,
 Meta
 hiring
 like
 30,000


people
 when
 they
 didn't
 need
 to
 during


COVID.
 I
 mean
 that
 obviously
 led
 to
 a


massive
 strain
 on
 their
 free
 cash
 flow


and
 you
 had
 not
 just
 Meta
 but
 pretty


much
 every
 company
 engage
 in
 that.
 So


when
 you
 have
 rates
 that
 are
 going
 up


and
 then
 you
 have
 earnings
 that
 can't


match
 the
 reality
 of
 the
 internal


economics
 of
 businesses,
 you
 know,
 small


businesses
 but
 also
 very
 large


businesses
 like
 Google,
 Meta,
 Amazon,


those
 are
 structural
 things
 that


fundamentally
 change
 the
 paradigm
 that


investors
 have
 to
 think
 about
 allocating


capital,
 which
 is
 why
 money
 market
 funds


had
 their
 biggest
 surge
 in
 over
 40
 years


because
 people
 said,
 you
 know
 what,
 I'm


gonna
 stay
 on
 the
 sideline
 and
 because


I'm
 getting
 5%
 to
 do
 nothing.
 Is
 that


paradigm
 or
 is
 that
 delta
 between
 how


investors
 are
 thinking
 of
 the
 world


versus
 how
 investors
 could
 be
 thinking


of
 the
 world
 going
 into
 2026
 is
 there


such
 a
 wide
 margin
 within
 that
 delta
 to


create
 an
 entirely
 new
 paradigm
 to
 think


about
 how
 to
 allocate
 capital
 which
 I
 I


would
 have
 to
 argue
 two
 things
 have
 to


take
 place
 number
 one
 the
 Fed
 has
 to


completely
 give
 up
 monetary
 easing
 which


I
 don't
 think
 that's
 going to
 happen
 I


think the
 opposite
 is
 going to
 happen


and
 then
 number
 two
 the
 AI
 trade
 has
 to


be
 dead


it's
 that
 simple
 those
 two
 things
 have


to


And
 if
 those
 two
 things
 don't
 happen,


I
 don't
 know
 if
 you're
 necessarily
 going


to
 set
 up
 for
 that
 type
 of
 2026.
 Uh


Trump
 just
 posted.
 All
 right,
 we
 got
 6


minutes
 until
 the
 market
 opens.
 The


Democrats
 are
 doing
 everything
 in
 their


withering
 power
 to
 push
 the
 Epstein
 hoax


again
 despite
 the
 DOJ
 releasing
 50,000


pages
 of
 documents
 in
 order
 to
 deflect


from
 older
 bad
 policies
 and
 losses,


especially
 the
 shutdown
 embarrassment


where
 their
 part
 is
 in
 total
 disarray


and
 has
 no
 idea
 what
 to
 do.
 Some
 weak


Republicans
 have
 fallen
 into
 their


clutches
 because
 they
 are
 soft
 and


foolish.
 Epstein
 was
 a
 Democrat
 and
 he's


the
 Democrat's
 problem,
 not
 the


Republicans's
 problem.
 Ask
 Bill
 Clinton,


Reed
 Hoffman,
 and
 Larry
 Summers
 about


Epstein.
 They
 all
 know
 about
 him.
 Don't


waste
 your
 time
 with
 Trump.
 I
 have
 a


country
 to
 run.


Okay,
 so
 I
 brought
 up
 the
 Epstein
 stuff


a
 couple
 days
 ago
 and
 the
 reason
 I


brought
 it
 up
 is
 because
 I
 do
 think
 that


it
 is
 having
 a
 PR
 implication
 on
 the


administration


and
 the
 fact
 that
 Trump
 is
 tweeting


about
 it
 and
 not
 tweeting
 about
 tariffs,


not
 tweeting
 about
 the
 economy,
 not


tweeting
 about
 grocery
 prices.
 I
 mean,


his
 last
 tweet
 before
 this
 tweet
 was


Jeffrey
 Epste
 and
 the
 tweet
 before
 that


was
 about
 Jeffrey
 Epstein.
 So,
 the
 last


three
 things
 that
 Trump
 actually
 typed


out,
 not
 just
 like
 memes
 or
 videos
 or


anything,
 the
 things
 that
 he
 either


typed
 out
 or
 his
 secretary
 typed
 out
 or


whatever
 that
 he
 wanted
 the
 world
 to


know
 about
 was
 about
 Epstein.
 I
 think


that
 also
 could
 be
 a
 risk
 to
 the
 markets


in
 the
 face
 of,
 hey,
 like
 Trump's
 just


not
 going
 to
 be
 talking
 about
 anything


else
 like
 the
 stuff
 we
 care
 about,
 which


is
 asset
 prices,
 tariffs,
 inflation,


etc.
 because
 he
 has
 this
 PR
 issue
 to


deal
 with
 around
 Epstein.
 The
 absolute


worst
 case
 scenario
 on
 this
 is
 that
 the


files
 are
 released
 and
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of


uh
 Senate
 Republicans
 that
 are
 getting


ready
 to
 vote
 to
 increase
 to
 release
 it.


Um
 and
 you
 know
 going
 against
 Trump
 on


the
 the
 the
 vote
 to
 not
 release
 it.
 If


it
 is
 released
 and
 there
 is
 something


deeply
 incriminating,
 which
 I
 don't
 know


if
 there
 is,
 I
 don't
 know if
 there
 would


be.
 Um
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 that
 even
 does


for
 the
 country
 at
 that
 point.
 So
 and


and
 maybe
 that's
 why
 he's
 spending
 so


much
 time
 really
 focusing
 on
 it.
 But


nonetheless,
 in
 terms
 of
 markets,
 the


markets
 are
 going
 to
 have
 to
 digest
 the


news
 of
 like
 the
 president
 not
 really


caring
 about
 stocks
 at
 the
 moment,
 but


caring
 more
 about
 this
 PR
 thing.


And
 so,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 what


happens
 with
 this
 as
 well.


If
 that
 happens,
 market
 will
 be
 cooked.


Well,
 at least
 the
 market
 will
 have


clarity.
 Yes,
 the
 market,
 I
 think,
 will


be
 cooked
 if
 something
 like
 that
 does


happen.
 But
 the
 market
 will
 finally
 have


clarity
 on
 knowing
 what
 the
 hell
 is


going
 on
 with
 this
 because
 this
 has
 been


an
 issue
 that
 the
 market,
 you
 know,
 has


been
 wondering
 about
 as
 well.
 It's
 just


it's
 been
 able
 to
 ignore
 it
 given


earnings
 have
 been
 so
 good.
 I
 mean,


quite
 frankly,
 the
 Epstein
 thing
 came
 up


back
 in
 May
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 talked


about
 it
 over
 the
 past
 two
 months


because
 earnings,
 AI,
 you
 know,


investments
 and
 the
 super
 cycle
 like
 all


of
 us
 started
 getting
 preoccupied
 with


other
 things.
 The
 market
 definitely


started
 caring
 about
 other
 things.
 This


pops
 up
 and
 it
 pops
 up
 in
 a
 more
 violent


way.
 Yeah,
 the
 market's
 going
 to
 start


to
 care


and
 they're
 going
 to
 want
 to
 have
 some


level
 of
 clarity
 on
 the
 trajectory
 of


what's
 actually
 happening.


Three
 minutes
 until
 this
 market
 opens.


Let's
 see
 what
 you
 guys
 said
 in
 the


poll.


Um,


pull
 this
 up.
 Red
 or
 green?
 I
 would
 bet


most
 of
 you
 guys
 said
 red.


Uh,
 67%
 say
 red
 for
 today.


All
 right,
 in
 the
 next
 two
 minutes,


we're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 ugly
 it
 gets.
 I
 I


will
 say
 in
 the
 pre-markets,
 it
 did
 get


worse
 than
 what
 it
 is
 right
 now.
 So,
 we


we
 are
 it's
 a
 very
 very
 minuscule


bounce,
 but
 it
 is
 not
 at
 the
 absolute


lows.
 So,
 in
 the
 next
 two
 minutes,
 we


see
 if
 that
 gets
 taken
 out
 immediately


or
 if
 that
 forms
 any
 level
 of
 base
 to
 go


higher.
 I
 think
 the
 number
 one
 thing
 for


today
 is
 can
 we
 stop
 the
 bleeding?


And
 you
 know,
 part
 of the
 reason
 Bitcoin


tanked
 yesterday
 is
 because
 the
 South


Koreans
 woke
 up
 and
 they
 saw
 the


Americans
 sold
 off
 everything.
 So,
 they


started
 selling
 off
 everything.
 And
 you


got
 a
 lot
 of
 South
 Koreans
 that
 are
 in


these
 high
 beta
 plays.
 Obviously,


Bitcoin
 being
 one
 of
 them,
 especially


from
 a
 uh
 perpetuals
 futures
 contract,


which
 is
 like
 getting
 you
 leverage
 on


your
 position.
 And
 you
 probably
 had
 a


lot
 of
 deleveraging
 happening
 across


Asia
 and
 across
 the
 entire
 world
 to


create
 some
 of
 this
 pain.
 So,
 global


markets
 at
 this
 point
 are
 deleveraging.


And
 the
 question
 becomes
 when
 does
 it


stop
 if
 it
 does
 stop?


But
 today
 we're
 going to
 have
 to
 see.


Fear
 and
 greed
 is
 extreme
 fear.
 That
 is


correct.
 Fear
 and
 greed
 is
 indeed


extreme
 fear,


which
 you
 know
 usually
 signals
 more


people
 buy
 the
 dip
 than
 not
 when
 that


happens.
 But


today
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 kind
 of
 how
 the


market
 is
 thinking
 about
 all
 this.


All
 right,
 here
 we
 go
 folks.
 We
 got


about
 20
 seconds.
 It's
 been
 an
 ugly


week.
 It
 has
 overall
 been
 a
 strong
 year,


but
 you
 have
 these
 ugly
 weeks
 in
 these


strong
 years.
 And
 now
 it
 is
 up
 to
 the


market
 to
 see
 how
 they
 want
 to
 navigate


the
 volatility
 of
 what
 we
 have
 been


experiencing
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks


and
 ultimately
 where
 this
 goes.
 Thank


you
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 It
 is


Friday,
 November
 14th,


9:30
 a.m.
 The
 snack
 market


is
 now
 open.


>> [music]


[music]


>> All
 right,
 wake
 your
 ass
 up.
 Let's
 get


into
 it.
 S&P
 500
 down
 1%
 on
 the
 day.


66530


down
 1%
 again.
 The
 low
 in
 the
 pre-market


was
 663,


but
 we
 are
 down.
 Nvidia
 182
 got
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 bounce.
 Paler
 getting
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 bounce.
 Robin
 Hood
 getting
 a


bit
 of
 a
 bounce.
 Tesla
 getting
 a
 bounce.


Micro
 Strategy
 back
 above
 200.
 SoFi


getting
 a
 bounce.
 D-Wave
 getting
 a


bounce.
 ONQ
 getting
 a
 bounce.
 Oaklo


getting
 a
 bounce.
 Everything.
 Meta
 back


above
 600.
 Nebius
 back
 at
 84
 up
 from
 80.


Coreweave
 that's
 back
 at
 76.
 Ire
 that's


back
 at
 46.
 The
 immediate
 reaction
 as


soon
 as
 the
 market
 opens
 is
 buy.
 Now


that
 could
 change
 instantly
 or
 that


could
 be
 the
 trend
 for
 today.
 The


immediate
 reaction
 at least
 on
 a
 lot
 of


these
 names
 that
 got
 hit
 hard
 in
 the


pre-market
 is
 buy.
 It
 could
 be
 a
 dead


cat.
 It
 could
 be
 not
 real.
 It
 could
 be,


you
 know,
 dip
 buyers
 coming
 in
 way
 too


early
 and
 they're
 about
 to
 get


slaughtered.
 Or
 it
 could
 be
 enough
 is


enough
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 selling
 action.


Google
 that
 as
 well
 still
 red
 but
 up


from
 270.
 These
 are
 very
 small
 dollar


moves
 but
 they
 are
 not
 violating
 those


pre-market
 lows.
 Yeah,
 New
 Bank
 had
 a


great
 earnings
 by
 the
 way.
 Phenomenal


earnings
 on
 New
 Bank.


That
 stock
 is
 down
 right
 here,
 but


absolutely
 incredible
 quarter.
 They
 beat


on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom
 and
 uh
 they


continue
 to
 show
 how
 well
 they're


executing.
 Regetti
 right
 here
 that
 gets


a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 bounce
 for
 up
 from
 23


pounder
 162
 to
 167


is
 your
 move
 on
 pounder.
 Now
 again,
 is


that
 enough
 to
 even
 form
 any
 level
 of
 a


base?
 That's
 the
 question.
 But


nonetheless,
 you
 are
 getting
 a
 bounce.


Robin
 Hood.
 So
 we
 went
 from
 112
 to
 117.


Now
 we're
 at
 11650.


So,
 as
 you
 can
 see,
 there's
 that
 red


candle.
 Actually,
 we
 hit
 11866.
 Now,
 you


got
 a
 red
 candle.
 So,
 that
 initial
 buy


that
 came
 in
 is
 now
 getting
 hit
 with


some
 selling.
 The
 question
 becomes,
 is


that
 selling
 going
 to
 violate
 those


lows?
 We
 just
 had
 Tesla,
 this
 one
 fell


below
 400,


387.
 It
 was
 at
 445


uh
 a
 couple
 of
 days
 ago.
 It
 was
 at
 400
 a


couple
 hours
 ago.
 Dualingo
 somehow
 is


green.
 Okay,
 you
 got
 Duolingo
 going


green.
 Verizon
 had
 a
 bunch
 of
 layoffs


yesterday.
 Verizon
 is
 green.
 CRM,


Salesforce,
 that's
 barely
 down.
 PayPal,


that
 is
 barely
 down.
 If
 there's
 any


ticker
 that's
 green,
 let
 me
 know
 in
 the


chat
 and
 I
 want
 to
 see
 which
 of
 these


tickers
 are
 green.
 Circle
 is
 actually


going
 green.
 They
 got
 hit
 pretty
 bad


this
 week,
 so
 it
 makes
 sense.
 They're


getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 rebound.


T-Mobile
 going
 a
 bit
 green.
 That
 one's


holding
 on
 to
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 momentum.


JP
 Morgan
 goes
 down.
 Microsoft
 back


below
 500
 again.
 Microsoft
 was
 back


below
 500
 last
 week,
 so
 not
 that
 crazy


in
 terms
 of
 price
 action.
 A
 lot
 of
 these


names
 are
 getting
 back
 to
 where
 they


were
 last
 week.
 It's
 just
 last
 week
 we


were
 hitting
 some
 lows.
 Open
 Door
 down


8%.
 That's
 down.
 The
 VIX
 is
 indeed


green.
 That
 That's
 correct.
 [laughter]


Disney
 got
 hit
 8%
 yesterday.
 Uh
 Disney


going
 green
 108.
 Upstart
 got
 hit
 badly


over
 the
 past
 two
 weeks.
 Upstart
 as


well.
 Going
 green,
 Upstart
 actually
 up


3%.


LAR
 is
 green.
 Homebuilders,
 again,
 a
 lot


of
 these
 are
 more
 defensive
 names.
 They


have
 not
 been
 the
 big
 performers
 this


year.
 A
 lot
 of
 that
 rotation
 from
 tech


continues
 to
 be
 something
 that
 the


market
 is
 trying
 to
 navigate
 as
 well.


Lenar
 right
 there
 123
 that's
 up
 1.43%.


Nvidia
 still
 red.
 Where
 is
 Nvidia


has
 not
 lost
 the
 pre-market
 low
 yet?


181.


It's
 not
 lost
 the
 pre-market
 low
 yet.


Birkshshire
 is
 green.
 That
 is
 correct.


Um
 Birkshshire
 Hathway.
 There
 you
 go.


Wow.
 Birkshire
 516.
 Dude,
 wasn't


Bergkshire
 Hold
 on.
 I
 feel
 like
 uh
 this


week.
 Yeah,
 Bergkshire
 is
 up
 4%
 this


week.
 Bergkshire
 was
 at
 497
 this
 week.


Look
 at
 that.
 All
 right,
 people
 coming


into
 value.
 That
 is
 an
 obvious
 sign.


They're
 looking
 for
 safety
 with
 Mr.


Buffett
 right
 here
 and
 they
 are
 getting


out
 of
 tech.
 So,
 Birkshshire,
 there
 you


go.
 Up
 5%
 for
 the
 week.
 S&P
 663.
 All


right.
 S&P
 loses
 665
 1.28%.


You're
 getting
 some
 names
 going
 green,


but
 the
 S&P
 $2
 away
 from
 that
 Friday


low.


$2
 away
 from
 that
 Friday
 low.
 So,


that's
 still
 getting
 hit.
 Robin
 and


Pounder
 have
 not
 hit
 their
 intraday
 lows


yet,
 even
 though
 S&P
 is
 making
 a
 new


one.
 Nebius
 as
 well
 has
 still
 not
 hit


that
 low,
 even
 though
 it's
 down
 83.
 BMR


at
 3465,
 that's
 down
 5%.
 Obviously,


Ethereum
 getting
 hit
 is
 wrecking
 that


3100
 on
 Ethereum.
 And
 then,
 where
 is


Bitcoin?
 Are
 we
 at
 95?


Uh,
 we
 are
 at
 951


on
 Bitcoin


Rocket
 Lab.
 This
 one
 got
 absolutely


destroyed.
 I
 mean,
 again,
 high
 beta


completely
 wrecked.
 44.
 At
 one
 point,
 it


was
 at
 42
 in
 the
 pre-market.
 So,
 again,


has
 not
 got
 back
 to
 those
 levels,
 but


no,
 4150
 in
 the
 pre-markets,


but
 you
 do
 have
 an
 obvious
 decline
 from


70
 to
 44,
 right?
 And
 and
 at
 44,
 it's


still
 up
 70%
 year-to-
 date.


So,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 are
 just
 losing
 that


super
 super
 premium
 valuation
 that
 they


got


um
 earlier
 this
 year.
 Grab
 right
 there,


that's
 down
 2.4%.
 Google,
 that's
 down


2%.
 Uh
 Nike,
 that's
 down
 2.5.
 Him's
 down


2%.
 New
 bank
 after
 a
 great
 quarter,


that's
 down
 1.6%.
 VG
 is
 that
 going
 up
 a


little bit.
 VG
 is
 going
 a
 little
 green,


1.65.
 Got
 some
 people
 going
 into
 natural


gas,


but
 that
 one
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of


green.


Coca-Cola
 and
 McDonald's
 green.
 Okay,
 so


that
 I
 mean
 you're
 obvious
 Coca-Cola,


McDonald's,
 and
 Birkshshire
 going
 green


is
 obviously
 the
 market
 saying
 they
 do


not
 want
 to
 play
 with
 Nvidia
 and
 AMD


right
 now
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 the


things
 that
 they
 know
 will
 never


not
 have
 demand,
 aka
 things
 like


McDonald
 or
 Coke.
 AMD
 right
 there
 236


that's
 down
 4.6%.


I
 mean,
 look,
 it
 was
 not
 uh
 I
 mean,
 we


got
 to
 see
 how
 this
 kind
 of
 plays
 out,


but
 if
 people
 expected
 a
 full-on
 like


four
 or
 five%
 dump
 as
 soon
 as
 the
 market


open,
 you
 did
 not
 get
 that
 yet.
 In
 fact,


you
 got
 the
 S&Ps
 basically
 trying
 to


hold
 on
 to
 660
 back
 right
 back
 to
 665
 on


the
 S.
 So,
 you
 did
 not
 get
 that


immediate


complete
 collapse.


you
 are
 getting
 buyers
 to
 step
 in


and
 it's
 not
 a
 full-on
 rotation,
 but


there
 obviously
 is
 a
 rotation
 and
 that


rotation
 has
 been
 happening
 all
 week.


So,
 that's
 not
 really
 new.
 Tesla
 391,


there's
 your
 green
 candle
 right
 there.


Palinger
 170
 green
 candle.
 Robin
 Hood


118
 green
 candle.


Now,
 here's
 the
 question.
 Are
 we
 going


to
 go
 through
 a
 entire
 Friday
 of
 green


wicks
 up
 and
 then
 red
 wicks
 down
 and
 end


up
 flat
 for
 the
 day?
 which
 is
 a
 very


possible
 scenario
 if
 the
 market
 has
 no


idea
 which
 way
 it
 wants
 to
 go
 or
 do
 we


develop
 a
 trend
 to
 the
 upside
 or


downside.


I
 don't
 know,
 but
 it
 would
 not
 surprise


me
 if
 we
 go
 back
 and
 forth
 with
 wicks
 up


and
 down.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 let's
 see.
 Robin


Hood
 118.
 Does
 that
 come
 back
 down
 to


114?


Does
 that
 actually
 come
 down
 to
 114?
 And


had
 a
 great
 earnings
 and
 uh
 they're
 up


4%
 today.
 They
 were
 up
 20%
 yesterday.


So,
 that
 one
 holding
 on
 is
 very
 nice
 to


see.
 Ethereum
 just
 slightly
 went
 green.


There
 you
 go.
 3164.


That
 is
 green.


Uh
 Nebius,
 how's
 that
 one
 doing?


McDonald's
 right
 there
 307.
 Nebius
 8566


up
 from
 81.


And
 then
 Rocket
 Lab
 going
 green
 as
 well.


Rockab
 was
 at
 44,
 now
 at
 4565.
 Again,


still
 down
 a
 ton
 for
 the
 week,
 but
 I


think
 the
 goal
 of
 today
 is
 can
 we
 stop


the
 bleeding
 or
 is
 there
 a
 world
 in


which
 the
 bleeding
 stops?
 Bitcoin
 96.


Okay,
 so
 you're
 obviously
 seeing
 a


little
 bit
 more
 of
 the
 dip
 bars
 coming


in.
 I
 ran
 as
 well,
 very
 close
 to
 going


green,
 was
 just
 at
 45,
 now
 at
 48.


Uh,
 Redcat,
 which
 got
 it
 had
 a
 good


earnings,
 but
 they
 just
 got
 hit
 pretty


bad
 yesterday
 after
 hours,
 that's
 only


down
 4%.
 It
 was
 down
 about
 10.


They
 are
 going
 to
 release
 jobs
 data.


That's
 correct.
 I
 mean
 that
 headline


came
 out
 a
 couple
 hours
 ago.
 The
 jobs


data
 is
 going
 to
 not
 include
 certain


metrics
 though.
 So
 I
 mean
 that
 is
 one


kind
 of
 headline
 they
 talked
 about
 which


is
 that
 jobs
 data
 will
 be
 released.
 It's


just
 not
 going
 to
 be
 inclusive.


But
 again,
 maybe
 more
 headlines
 today


about
 data
 transparency


that
 maybe
 that
 is
 could
 be
 enough


theoretically
 to
 get
 the
 market
 to
 at


least
 be
 a
 bit
 more
 excited


about
 having
 some
 more
 clarity
 on
 what's


going
 on.
 S&P
 high
 of
 day
 666.20


66.20
 Dwave
 thinking
 of
 going
 green.


That
 is
 correct.
 Dwave
 right
 there
 only


down
 1.8.
 It
 was
 down
 almost
 seven
 in


the
 pre-markets.
 That
 is
 moving
 with
 the


broader
 market.
 Nvidia
 184


down
 1.4.
 four.


All right,
 that's
 a
 dollar
 away
 from


potentially
 getting
 back
 up
 there
 as


that
 continues
 to
 try
 to
 go
 green.


Salesforce
 237.
 Do
 a
 lingo
 188.
 That's


still
 green.
 Tesla
 eight
 bucks
 away
 from


400.


Eight
 bucks
 away
 from
 400.


Again,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 back
 and


forth
 between
 the
 bears
 and
 the
 bulls


today.
 The
 bulls
 are
 probably
 looking
 at


some
 of
 these
 prices
 and
 saying
 these


prices
 don't
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.
 Some


of these
 stocks
 are
 probably
 still
 a
 bit


expensive,
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 a


stock
 market
 is
 a
 stock
 market.
 Like
 you


could
 disagree
 with
 Rocklab's
 valuation


at
 44,
 but
 a
 draw
 down
 from
 70
 to
 44.
 I


mean,
 there
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 new


shareholders
 that
 were
 created
 over
 the


past
 few
 months
 that
 are
 probably
 either


DCAing
 or
 holding
 on
 or
 averaging
 down.


So
 then
 the
 question
 becomes,
 you
 know,


does
 the
 market
 hate
 Rocket
 Lab
 at
 44
 so


much
 that
 it
 needs
 to
 go
 back
 to
 30


after
 all
 the
 progress
 and
 all
 the


earnings
 growth
 and
 3
 cents
 away
 from


profitability
 and
 if
 not
 is
 that
 the


bottom
 or
 do
 the
 bears
 say
 nope
 doesn't


deserve
 that
 price
 and
 it
 needs
 to


continue
 going
 lower


and
 I
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 the


debate
 today.
 Grab
 right
 there
 down
 2%


back
 above
 542
 UNH
 326
 1.89%.
 We
 did
 get


some
 13Fs
 yesterday.
 David
 Ter
 sold
 all


of
 his
 UNH.
 Howard
 Marks
 bought
 another


million
 shares
 of
 Grab.
 Uh
 Bridgewwater


bought
 another
 4.5
 million
 shares
 of


Grab.
 They
 also
 bought
 new
 positions
 in


Rocket
 Lab,
 Palenter,
 and
 Robin
 Hood.
 Um


we're
 still
 waiting
 on
 Altimters
 13F
 and


Stanley
 Ducker
 Miller
 and
 Tiger
 Global,


but
 we
 did
 get
 some
 of
 the
 other
 ones


yesterday.
 Also,
 Howard
 Marks
 bought
 New


Bank
 4
 million
 shares.
 It's
 pretty
 big


sign
 of
 confidence
 in
 what
 they're


doing.
 And
 so,
 a
 bit
 more


diversification
 outside
 of
 the
 United


States.
 And
 seven
 bucks.
 Wow.
 Up
 7.4%.


And
 is
 a
 high
 beta
 name.
 It's
 not
 easy


to
 get
 a
 name
 like
 that
 going
 green
 on
 a


day
 like
 this.
 So
 if
 that's
 going
 green,


you
 are
 seeing
 the
 market


potentially
 get
 a
 bit
 more
 excited
 about


buying
 the
 dip
 on
 some
 of
 these
 other


names.
 And
 video
 right
 there
 18455.


Firefly
 as
 well.
 They
 had
 a
 good


earnings
 a
 couple
 days
 ago.
 That
 one's


up
 6.5%.


Robin
 Hood's
 looking
 for
 119
 again.


Robin
 Hood
 was
 almost
 at
 112
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 It
 actually
 did
 hit
 119
 for


a
 second.
 Got
 rejected
 at
 11942.


And
 then
 Big
 Bear
 AI
 that
 goes
 green
 as


well.


Like
 you
 can
 hate
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 high
 beta


names
 for
 whatever
 reason
 you
 do,
 but


the
 other
 thing
 to
 remember
 is
 that


after
 30
 40%
 draw
 downs
 on
 some
 of these


names,
 the
 question
 becomes
 like
 are


they
 going
 to
 go
 down
 70
 to
 80%.
 And


usually
 you
 see
 that
 in
 a
 full-on
 bare


market,
 right?
 That's
 what
 we
 saw
 with


Palanteer,
 right?
 80%
 when
 it
 was
 super


high
 beta
 in
 2021.
 Um,


a
 lot
 of
 those
 other
 names
 that
 maybe


they
 don't
 have
 the
 trajectory
 of


pounder
 one
 one
 in
 in
 in
 the
 lifetime
 of


their
 company,
 but
 they
 still
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day
 have
 a
 stock
 price
 that
 is


traded
 publicly
 like
 after
 a
 30
 40%
 draw


down,
 you
 tend
 to
 have
 some
 people
 say,


"All
 right,
 enough
 is
 enough."
 And
 I


wonder
 if
 that
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 we
 might


be
 seeing
 here
 crossboard.
 Birkshshire


is
 going
 down.
 Look
 at
 that.
 Bergkshire


going
 down
 at
 the
 same
 time
 as
 some
 of


these
 other
 names
 going
 up
 after
 the


opposite.


ETH
 is
 green.
 SoFi,
 again,
 this
 isn't


Granny
 Shots.


I
 did
 not
 talk
 about
 the
 new
 BMR
 CEO.
 I


just
 saw
 that
 press
 release.
 So
 right


there,
 27.82.
 So
 um
 they
 do
 have
 a
 new


CEO.
 I
 don't
 know
 anything
 about
 this


guy,
 but
 that
 was
 the
 headline
 today


that
 there
 is
 a
 new
 CEO
 for
 Bitmine
 and


and
 three
 new
 people
 joined
 the
 board.


Um,
 yeah,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 any
 of
 these


people
 are.
 I
 would
 have
 to
 go
 through


them,
 but
 that
 is
 one
 of
 the
 headlines.


Again,
 ET's
 price
 action
 is
 going
 to
 be


a
 lot
 more
 important
 for
 the
 overall


trajectory
 of
 BMR.
 3187
 on
 Ethereum.
 New


bank
 goes
 green.


Tom
 Lee
 is
 not
 the
 CEO.
 He's
 the


chairman.
 He's
 the
 chairman


of
 the
 of
 the
 company.
 Yeah.
 Morgan


Stanley
 raised
 their
 price
 target
 to


Nvidia
 to
 220.
 We
 read
 the
 Morgan


Stanley
 report
 this
 morning
 and
 the
 Key


Bank
 report
 again
 like
 when
 you
 just


look
 at
 the
 raw
 numbers
 on
 what
 these


maybe
 you
 don't
 think
 Nvidia
 deserves


the
 multiple
 they're
 at.
 But
 to
 say
 that


AI
 is
 all
 fake
 and
 it's
 not
 real.
 It's


like
 I
 am
 sympathetic
 to
 the
 argument.
 I


want
 to
 hear
 the
 other
 side,
 but
 then
 I


just
 look
 at
 the
 raw
 numbers
 and
 I'm


like,
 okay,
 well,
 if
 you
 believe
 that


they're
 going
 to
 do
 this
 much
 in
 EPS
 and


you
 put
 a
 3040
 multiple
 where
 you're
 not


giving
 Nvidia
 90
 or
 a
 600
 57,000


multiple,
 you're
 giving
 them
 something


within
 30
 and
 50.


And
 like,
 yeah,
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


premium
 when
 you're
 you're
 talking
 about


50,
 maybe
 not
 30,
 but
 if
 a
 company
 is


growing
 at
 the
 rate
 they're
 growing
 at,


that
 is
 not
 abnormal
 in
 the
 stock
 market


by
 any
 sense
 of
 the
 imagination.
 I
 mean,


if
 Tesla
 can
 get
 a
 200
 PE
 and
 Tesla's


not
 even
 growing,
 which
 there's


obviously
 reasons
 it
 gets
 that
 premium


for
 the
 potential
 of
 what
 they
 can
 do,


but
 if
 Nvidia
 is
 not
 allowed
 to
 have
 a


50
 PE
 for
 the
 growth
 they're
 putting
 up,


then
 what
 are
 we
 talking
 about?
 So,
 the


the
 question
 then
 becomes,
 is
 that
 a


bubble?
 And
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's
 the


easiest
 argument
 to
 make.
 186
 right
 here


on
 Nvidia
 that
 is
 giving
 you


a
 bit
 more
 green
 as
 well


on
 the
 day.
 I'll
 pull
 up
 the
 heat
 map
 in


a
 second.


Nvidia
 very
 close
 to
 going
 green.
 Robin


Hood
 very
 close
 to
 119.
 Redcat
 still


down
 3%.
 Warner
 Brothers
 going
 green
 on


the
 day.


Uh
 I
 did
 not
 see
 any
 Amorn
 the
 13Fs.


Where's
 Amcore?
 Was
 that
 29?
 Amcor
 is
 at


31.
 Okay,
 so
 you
 got
 some
 green
 candles


right
 there
 as
 well.


Micron
 is
 also
 going
 green.


Uh
 243
 2.72.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 like
 if
 you


thought
 the
 AI
 bubble
 was
 popping,


Micron
 doesn't
 go
 green.
 But
 then
 again,


if
 you
 look
 at
 Micron's
 earnings,
 again,


you
 could
 disagree
 with
 Micron's


multiple,
 but
 you
 cannot
 say
 that
 this


is
 like
 bubble
 to
 me
 is
 more
 so
 a


question
 of
 these
 companies
 are
 fake.


And
 it's
 like
 these
 companies
 are
 not


fake.
 Like
 you
 look
 at
 their
 earnings,


they
 are
 very
 very
 real
 in
 terms
 of
 what


they're
 putting
 out.


even
 if
 you
 might
 not
 love
 the
 multiple


that
 they're
 trading
 at.
 Um,


okay,
 let
 me
 pull
 up
 the
 heat
 map.
 It


takes
 a
 second
 for
 it
 to
 uh
 update.
 DW,


by
 the
 way,
 going
 green.
 Robin
 Hood


11929.


11929


as
 Robin
 Hood
 goes
 green.
 Tesla
 392.


Oaklo
 right
 there
 going
 green.
 Now,
 some


people
 might
 be
 saying,
 well,
 Oaklo
 is


indicative
 of
 a
 bubble.
 And
 there's


there's
 two
 basic
 arguments
 to
 that.


Number
 one,
 if
 Oak
 went
 to
 zero,
 it's
 a


$16
 billion
 company.
 I
 don't
 think
 that


would
 really
 matter,
 right?
 If
 Micron


went
 to
 zero,
 that
 would
 be
 a
 big
 deal


because
 Micron
 is
 a
 very
 big
 supplier


for
 memory.
 So
 like
 that
 stuff
 really
 m


but
 Oaklo,
 okay,
 that's
 not
 that
 big
 a


deal.
 Number
 two
 is
 the
 reason
 Oaklo
 is


getting
 this
 multiple
 even
 though
 I
 do


not
 think
 it
 deserves
 it.
 But


nonetheless,
 you
 know,
 the
 market
 is
 the


market
 is
 because
 the
 market
 thinks,


hey,
 if
 nuclear
 power
 is
 going
 to
 be


that
 important
 and
 we
 need
 small
 modular


nuclear
 reactor
 companies
 that
 are


building
 this
 stuff,
 then
 we're
 going
 to


pull
 forward
 that
 growth.
 That
 is
 the


market
 deciding
 how
 the
 market
 wants
 to


think
 of
 it.
 But
 there
 is
 a
 narrative


for
 why
 it
 gets
 its
 valuation.
 And
 also


Oakl
 is
 down
 from
 193.
 It's
 already
 been


chopped
 in
 in
 half.
 So


again,
 a
 stock
 market
 is
 a
 stock
 market.


When
 you
 get
 chopped
 in
 50%,
 there
 are


people
 that
 get
 interested
 in
 the
 in
 the


price.
 Here's
 the
 heat
 map.
 Still
 red


across
 the
 board.
 We
 have
 not
 totally


flipped

 it

 VIX

Yeah,
 VIX
 is
 down
 11.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 still


up
 on
 the
 day,
 but
 it's
 down
 from
 the


highs,


which
 again
 is
 bullish.

that
 would
 also
 be
 very,


very
 bullish.

 it's

 like
 none


of

 none
 of
 our

 are


are
 are
 staring
 at
 the

 from
 663


to

and

 just,
 you
 know,
 absolute


tears
 of

 seeing

 these

 But
 we
 are
 we
 Oh,
 it's

 That's
 for
 damn

Has
 your
 portfolio
 gone
 green
 yet?
 No,


but
 it's
 very
 close.
 I'm
 looking
 at
 it


right
 now.
 It
 is,
 dude,
 my
 portfolio
 is


nowhere
 near
 where
 it
 was
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 Put
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 your


portfolio
 went
 green.
 It
 is
 very
 close


to
 getting
 that
 green.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 just


looking
 at
 a
 literal
 V
 on
 my
 Robin
 Hood.


So,
 we're
 not
 there
 yet.
 Maybe
 it's
 a


head
 fake.


Robin
 Hood
 121,
 but
 as
 you
 can
 see,


I
 mean,
 Robin
 Hood
 was
 112
 in
 the


pre-markets,
 guys.
 Like
 what
 happened


between
 the
 pre-market
 and
 now?
 What


happened
 within
 two
 hours
 for
 them
 to


add
 $10
 billion
 in
 market
 cap?
 Like


nothing.
 Nvidia
 went
 green.
 There
 you


go.
 Nvidia
 went
 green.
 From
 180
 to
 187,


Nvidia
 has
 24
 billion
 shares


outstanding.
 That
 is
 a
 $7
 move.
 7*
 24


is


168
 billion.
 I
 mean,
 what
 happened
 in


the
 past
 45
 minutes
 to
 have
 that
 large


of
 a
 move?
 Nothing.
 Like,
 this
 is


obviously
 being
 controlled
 at
 a
 deeper


level
 around
 ALOS
 and
 stop
 losses
 and


margin
 that
 was
 probably
 happening
 in


the
 pre-market
 that
 created
 more


liquidation
 and
 all
 the
 selling


pressure.
 Obviously,
 there
 are
 people


that
 are
 coming
 in
 and
 buying,
 but


getting
 the
 market
 to
 say,
 "No,
 we


thought
 180
 was
 enough
 for
 at least
 for


now.
 Maybe
 we
 re
 revisit
 that,
 but
 at


least
 for
 now,
 the
 market
 was
 saying


that
 pre-market
 action
 was
 enough.


Now
 again,
 we've
 been
 whipsawed
 back
 and


forth
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks.
 It


would
 not
 surprise
 me,
 not
 one
 bit,
 not


one
 freaking
 bit,
 if
 Nvidia
 goes
 back


down
 to
 180
 because
 there
 was
 no
 reason


for
 it
 to
 go
 to
 180.
 One
 could
 argue


there's
 no
 reason
 for
 it
 to
 necessarily


go
 to
 187.
 Maybe
 there's
 not
 another


reason
 for
 it
 to
 go
 back
 to
 180.
 I
 mean,


this
 is
 a
 game
 of
 chicken
 that
 the


markets
 have
 been
 playing
 really
 for


three
 weeks
 now,
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 has


been
 due
 to
 the
 lack
 of
 data.
 So
 the


markets
 are,
 you
 know,
 trying
 to


navigate
 it
 the
 best
 they
 can,
 but
 I


think
 you
 got
 to
 be
 ready
 for
 both


sides.


You
 got
 to
 be
 ready
 for
 absolutely
 both.


It's
 hard
 to
 say
 we
 completely
 out
 of


the
 woods.
 I
 I
 would
 struggle
 to
 say


that
 because
 there's
 no
 way
 you
 can


necessarily
 know.
 Nvidia
 goes
 red
 again


by
 about
 30
 cents.
 So
 you
 got
 sellers
 at

 said,
 "All
 right,
 that
 was
 enough


of
 the
 bull
 momentum
 and
 now
 they're


taking
 it
 back
 down."

 here

A
 little
 bit
 of

 from

 higher
 base
 than
 what
 it
 was
 in
 the


pre-markets.


Um,
 Nvidia
 does
 have
 earnings
 next
 week


as
 well.
 That's
 important.
 TSSI
 just
 a


terrible
 quarter.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 it


probably
 deserves
 to
 be
 down
 40%.
 Like,


this
 is
 one
 of
 those
 names.
 They're
 a


supplier
 for
 Dell
 and
 they
 really
 did


not
 have
 the
 best
 quarter
 at
 all.
 um


down
 40%
 on
 revenue,


adjusted
 EBA
 margins
 getting
 hit.


I
 mean
 their
 supplier
 for


Adele,
 but
 the
 market
 did
 not
 say
 hello


to
 them.
 The
 market
 said
 goodbye
 and


that's
 why
 that
 stock
 is
 down
 42%
 right


here.
 Ethereum
 3100,
 Robin
 Hood
 120.5,


the
 New

as
 well.


That
 was
 good,
 right?
 You
 can't
 lie.


That
 was
 [laughter]
 that
 was
 Dude,
 if
 AI


takes
 my
 job,
 I'm
 just
 gonna
 become
 a


comedian.
 Like
 there's
 like
 I
 I
 need
 to


make
 sure
 that
 I
 uh
 that
 I
 have
 a
 backup


plan.
 And
 you
 know,
 some
 of
 you
 guys


might
 have
 heard
 that
 jerk
 that
 that


that
 joke
 last
 night,
 but
 you
 know,


there's
 more
 people
 here
 that
 weren't


there
 on
 the
 market
 close.
 So,
 you
 need


to
 democratize
 the
 distribution
 of
 the


humor.
 And
 so,
 I
 needed
 to
 spread
 the


joke
 again
 to
 other
 people.


So,
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is,
 but
 comedy
 is
 the


backup
 plan.

 level
 of
 intellectualism
 it


takes
 to
 connect
 Adele
 and
 then
 the


company
 Dell
 and
 then
 to
 be
 able
 to
 know


the
 the
 the
 popular
 songs
 to
 be
 able
 to


then
 mix
 that
 in
 with
 the
 punchline


which
 is
 the
 market
 said
 goodbye
 not


hello
 like
 when
 you
 really
 break
 it
 down


from
 a
 psychoanalytical
 perspective


it's
 a
 phenomenal
 joke
 like
 actually


phenomenal
 and
 anyone
 hating
 on
 that


joke
 I
 I
 just
 don't
 think
 you
 get
 comedy


that's
 okay
 but
 it's
 important
 to


understand
 the
 the
 parameters
 of
 of
 what


makes
 a
 foundational
 joke
 actually.
 Good


Nvidia
 right
 there
 187
 that's
 green


breaking
 through
 to
 new
 highs
 on
 the
 day


18730


uh
 Rocket
 Lab
 4717
 Robin
 Hood
 122


is
 green


on
 the
 day


okay
 so
 we're
 I
 mean
 meta
 back
 above
 600


we
 are
 seeing
 more
 green
 come
 in
 it's


just
 a
 question
 of
 if
 the
 market
 has
 the


stomach
 to
 continue
 holding
 on
 to
 these


names
 as
 more
 people
 come
 in
 and
 buy
 the


dip.


Does
 feels
 like
 there's
 more
 algo


stepping
 in.


Jokes
 like
 that
 are
 why
 we
 are
 down.
 Oh


my
 gosh.


It
 was
 a
 good
 joke,
 dude.
 It
 was
 a
 good


freaking
 joke.


JD,
 this
 one's
 down.
 They
 had
 a
 good


earnings.
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 in


that
 one
 that
 got
 hit.
 Weeble
 fell
 below


$9.
 Weeull
 still
 below
 $9.
 $8.99.
 Was
 it


at
 7?
 No,
 it
 was
 at
 855
 in
 the


pre-markets.


8.90.
 So,
 so
 here's
 the
 thing,
 right?


And
 this
 is
 no
 disrespect
 to
 Weeble,
 but


like
 this
 is
 where
 you
 have
 to
 ask


yourself,
 do
 I
 even
 believe
 in
 the


company?
 Like,
 I
 I
 deeply
 believe
 in


Robin
 Hood
 and
 if
 Robin
 Hood
 goes
 down,


I
 am
 willing
 to
 deal
 with
 them
 going


down
 because
 I
 just
 believe
 in
 them.


Weeble
 going
 down,
 do
 you,
 you
 know,
 do


you
 believe
 in
 the
 second
 fiddle
 player


in
 the
 market
 like
 a
 Weeble
 or
 was
 it


just
 a
 trade?
 And
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 asking
 themselves
 those


questions
 today
 because
 Robinet
 to
 me
 is


not
 a
 trade.
 It
 truly
 is
 a
 very


long-term
 investment
 that
 I
 want
 to
 be


part
 of.
 And
 there
 will
 be
 ups
 and


downs.
 That's
 part
 of
 the
 process,
 but
 I


can
 hold
 on
 to
 it.
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 probably
 asking,
 do
 I
 even


care
 about
 Weeble?
 Am
 I
 able
 to
 hold
 on


to
 it
 or
 did
 I
 think
 it
 could
 just
 be
 a


little
 mini
 Robin
 Hood?
 Same
 thing
 with


Big
 Bear
 AI
 today.
 You
 know,
 Baron's


called
 it
 the
 next
 Paler.
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot


of
 people
 probably
 asking
 themselves
 who


bought
 it
 at
 850,
 do
 I
 actually
 think


it's
 the
 next
 Palier
 or
 did
 I
 just,
 you


know,
 buy
 because
 of
 a
 headline?
 And


those
 are
 valid
 questions
 on
 a
 day
 like


this
 for
 people
 to
 ask.


Uh
 D-Wave
 5.6.


It
 was
 down
 8%
 pre-markets.
 Now
 it's


green.
 IN
 barely
 red.
 Nebius
 very
 close


to
 going
 green
 on
 Nebus.
 AMD
 as
 well


very
 close
 to
 catching
 up
 with
 Nvidia


and
 going
 green
 for
 the
 day.
 Nvidia
 now


18713.


18713.


Okay.
 So,
 you
 are
 seeing
 some
 of
 the


buyers
 step
 in.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 find


any
 of
 the


any
 of
 the
 other
 headlines
 that
 we're


seeing
 right
 here.
 Extreme
 fear.
 We
 are


still
 at
 14,
 guys.
 So,
 we
 are
 still


obviously
 in
 that
 extreme
 fear
 category.


Um,
 now
 it's
 at
 15.
 So,
 it's
 not
 at
 14


anymore,
 but
 nonetheless,
 still
 extreme


fear.
 China
 warns
 citizens


>> [clears throat]


>> against
 visiting
 Japan
 in
 near
 future.


That
 headline
 just
 came
 out.


China
 warns
 citizens
 against
 visiting


Japan
 in
 the
 near
 future.


Okay.


[laughter]
 The
 last
 thing
 we
 need
 is
 a


China
 Taiwan
 issue.
 I
 hope
 that's
 not


the
 case.
 But
 you
 have
 that.
 And
 then


you
 have
 China's
 export
 controls
 on
 rare


earth
 causing
 shortages,
 raising
 prices


for
 users,
 and
 aerospace
 shipmaking.


sources
 say
 that
 stuff
 should
 be


resolved
 as
 we
 have
 a
 new
 framework
 with


China
 on
 rare
 earths
 and
 video
 right


there
 18740
 high
 of
 day


is
 that
 one
 goes
 green
 I
 don't
 have
 a


reason
 for
 why
 they
 said
 to
 not
 visit


Japan
 I'm
 trying
 to
 find
 out
 that's
 just


the
 raw
 headline


on
 what
 they
 said
 Oaklo
 is
 up
 4%
 Nvidia


wow
 if
 Nvidia
 hits
 190
 today
 dude
 I
 mean


if
 you
 bought
 in
 the
 pre-markets
 you
 got


a
 real
 big
 move
 right
 there
 2869
 9.
 So


if
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 to
 30
 and
 then


pounder


172


extreme
 fear
 of
 more
 jokes.
 [gasps]


Oh
 my
 goodness,
 dude.


That
 was
 a
 good
 one.


It
 was
 a
 good
 one.
 Even
 if
 you
 didn't


laugh,
 you
 have
 to
 acknowledge


the
 uh
 the
 structure
 of
 it
 was
 good.


Amcore
 32
 S&P
 not
 green,
 but
 it's
 only


half
 a
 percent
 away.


Okay.
 So,
 so
 dip
 buyers
 obviously


stepped
 in
 at
 663.
 That
 was
 your
 level


today
 so
 far.
 I
 know
 it's
 only
 27


minutes
 in,
 but
 that
 was
 your
 level


today
 so
 far.


About
 it.
 AAB's
 up
 4%.
 Vertib's
 up


today.
 Yeah,
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 these


names
 starting
 to
 go
 green.
 Look
 at


that.
 AAB
 up
 4%.
 They
 had
 a
 crappy
 week,


but
 they're
 up.
 Uh,
 Beyond
 Meat,
 how


about
 that
 one?
 That
 is
 up
 10%.


I
 mean,
 dude,
 we're
 really
 gonna


like
 this
 is
 I
 mean,
 if
 if
 Beyond
 Meat's


going
 up,
 you
 would
 imagine
 Nvidia
 is


probably
 catching
 a
 bit.


Like,
 someone
 right
 now
 is
 behind
 buying


Beyond
 Meat.


Mit,
 my
 neck
 hurts
 from
 this


whiplashing.


Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 all
 of
 us
 this
 week,


I
 just
 I
 just
 would
 like
 to
 hold
 it


towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 Like
 again


again
 the
 I
 I'm
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think


any
 of
 us
 want
 to
 be
 greedy
 today.
 The


number
 one
 thing
 we
 should
 all
 care


about
 even
 if
 the
 day
 ends
 red
 is
 let
 it


be
 a
 very
 slight
 red
 because
 whatever


the
 hell
 we
 saw
 in
 the
 pre-markets
 which


was
 not
 that
 long
 ago
 was
 ugly.
 Like


very
 ugly.
 And
 if
 we
 can
 just
 stop
 the


bleeding
 that
 would
 be
 a
 win
 for
 today.


That
 would
 be
 a
 win
 for
 the
 day.
 Open


door
 890.
 That
 goes
 green.


Yeah
 we
 need
 stability
 first.


A
 lot
 of
 the
 buying
 could
 be
 short


covering.
 That's
 that's
 also
 correct.


My
 neck
 hurts
 from
 head
 banging.


Coreweave,
 how's
 that
 one
 doing?
 You


know,
 I
 actually
 watched
 a
 uh
 a
 video
 on


Cororeweave
 last
 night
 from
 Tickerolu.


That
 one,
 yeah,
 that
 one's
 not
 really


catching
 too
 much
 of
 a
 bid.
 It
 still
 is


up
 in
 the
 pre-market.
 And
 he
 did
 a


really
 good
 job
 explaining
 the
 like
 the


the
 the
 I
 guess
 you
 could
 say
 moat
 of


Corweave.
 Now,
 I
 still
 don't
 love
 their


debt
 profile,
 which
 is
 why
 it's
 hard
 for


me
 to
 buy
 it.
 But
 there's
 a
 reason
 why


investors
 are
 interested
 in
 the
 name
 in


the
 first
 place.
 And
 it
 has
 to
 do
 again


with
 all
 the
 contracted
 GPU
 licenses


that
 is
 a
 result
 of
 outstripping
 demand


over
 supply.


It's
 just
 that
 simple.


Which
 is
 why
 when
 you
 get
 the
 dot


comparisons
 again,
 it's
 just
 really
 hard


to
 get
 on
 board
 with
 that.
 I'm
 more
 on


board
 with
 a
 a
 bear
 who
 makes
 an


argument
 about
 the
 labor
 market
 than
 I


am
 at
 all
 with
 a
 dot
 comparison.


I
 mean,
 yeah,
 even
 if
 you
 look
 at


Palanteer's
 earnings,
 like
 Palanteer,


which
 is
 not
 like
 a
 foundation
 model


company,
 but
 they're
 actually
 making


sense
 of
 the
 models,
 they're
 growing
 at


63%
 of
 a
 large
 base.
 Like
 you're
 not
 you


can't
 get
 that
 type
 of
 growth
 unless


something
 happens
 in
 the
 market
 that


forces
 a
 level
 of
 inbound
 because
 they


don't
 have
 a
 sales
 force
 realistically


to
 to
 to
 to
 inquire
 about
 your
 product


and
 service.


Like
 when
 you
 experience
 that
 type
 of


hyperrowth
 is
 because
 something
 is


happening
 that
 is
 one
 could
 argue
 beyond


your
 control
 and
 if
 you
 can
 harness
 the


opportunity
 of
 what's
 happening
 you
 can


materialize
 it
 into
 meaningful
 earnings


growth.
 So
 again,
 when
 people
 say,


"Well,
 AI
 is
 fake.
 It's
 not
 real."
 It's


like,
 "Well,
 why
 are
 these
 companies


growing
 then?"


Like,
 why
 are
 they
 growing?
 Like
 Like


what's
 the
 reason
 for
 are
 they
 are
 they


is
 pounder
 getting
 paid
 millions
 of


dollars
 by
 companies
 for
 fun?
 Like
 are


are
 these
 hospitals
 that
 have
 said


they're
 saving
 $10
 million
 a
 year
 paying


pounder
 30
 million
 because
 they
 they


like
 Alex
 Karp?
 It's
 like
 no.
 Like


they're
 paying
 them
 for
 a
 product
 and


service.


And
 that
 kind
 of
 pushes
 back
 against
 the


argument
 that
 none
 of
 it's
 real.
 Nebius


right
 there
 8807


as
 that
 goes
 green.
 How
 about
 Soundhound


on
 the
 day


1223.


That's
 green
 as
 well.
 VIX
 really
 getting


a
 VIC
 uh
 a
 wick
 down
 now.
 VIX.
 Yeah,


dude.
 It
 was
 up
 15.
 Now
 it's
 up
 nine.


It's
 a
 pretty
 big
 decline
 right
 there.


Still
 up
 on
 the
 day.


S&P
 just
 got
 a
 red
 candle,
 but
 still


trying
 to
 hold
 668.


M
 I
 don't
 think
 anyone
 is
 actually


arguing
 that
 AI
 is
 fake.
 The
 actual


questions
 around
 ROI
 and
 how
 fast
 that


ROI
 comes.
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 fair
 point.


The
 the
 but
 the
 implication
 of


questioning
 the
 the
 entire
 structure
 of


ROI
 and
 then
 as
 a
 result
 making
 the


comparison
 to
 the
 dot
 bubble
 is


basically
 saying
 we
 have
 over
 spent
 on


capex,
 we
 have
 over
 spent
 on
 chips
 and


like
 the
 the
 supply
 of
 of
 of
 those
 chips


in
 those
 data
 centers.
 And
 the
 reasoning


for
 that
 overspending


is
 nonsense
 because
 there's
 not
 an


actual
 return.
 And
 that's
 why
 I
 point
 to


something
 like
 Palant's
 earnings
 again.


But
 like
 so
 AIP
 launches
 in
 June
 of


2023.
 I
 think
 that's
 when
 it
 was
 like


chatbt
 3.5
 or
 whatever.
 Now
 we're
 at


chatbt
 5
 is
 which
 is
 a
 model
 that


pounder
 is
 implementing.


OpenAI
 pays
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 to
 build
 out


the
 capex
 to
 train
 that
 model.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 the
 quoteunquote
 ROI
 on
 that


model,
 at least
 from
 about
 from
 an


enterprise
 workflow
 perspective,
 is
 the


63%
 revenue
 growth
 that
 we
 saw
 on


Pounder
 because
 Pounder
 doesn't
 get
 that


type
 of
 growth
 unless
 you
 have
 an
 LLM


that
 is
 as
 good
 as
 a
 GPT5
 or
 Gro
 4
 or


whatever
 that
 they
 can
 actually


deploy
 in
 a
 hospital
 that
 would
 be


willing
 to
 pay
 them
 $30
 million
 a
 year.


Like
 without
 that
 LLM
 in
 the
 first


place,
 there
 is
 no
 ROI,
 right?
 because


that's
 the
 whole
 point
 of


operationalizing
 AI.
 So
 the
 question


then
 just
 becomes,
 you
 know,
 we're


spending
 trillions
 of
 dollars
 on
 capex.


Will
 there
 be
 multi-
 trillions
 of


dollars
 of
 ROI?
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 a


fair
 thing
 to
 be
 skeptical
 about.
 But
 we


my
 point
 is
 in
 the
 early
 innings,
 are


you
 seeing
 signs
 of
 that
 progress?
 And
 I


feel
 like
 the
 answer
 to
 that
 question
 is


yes.


And
 and
 not
 because
 I'm
 guessing,


because
 I'm
 looking
 at
 the
 earnings.


Gemini
 3.0
 is
 about
 to
 be
 fired.
 Dude,


there
 were
 people
 there
 were
 some


engineers
 on
 Twitter
 last
 night
 tweeting


about
 Gemini
 3.0
 O
 that
 got
 early
 access


to
 it.
 I
 mean,
 I
 was
 just
 excited


reading
 the
 comments
 that
 they
 were


posting.
 I
 mean,
 they
 they they
 were


saying
 this
 is
 like
 one
 of
 the
 most


significant
 upgrades
 they've
 seen
 in
 a


large
 language
 model
 since
 sonnet
 4.5.


And
 so
 again,
 you
 got
 to
 think
 like
 what


does
 that
 mean
 for
 Gemini?
 What
 does


that
 mean
 for
 Whimo?
 What
 does
 that
 mean


for
 enterprise
 adoption?
 What
 does
 that


mean
 for
 pounder
 when
 they
 can
 make


sense
 of
 a
 Gemini
 inside
 of
 an


enterprise
 that
 allows
 them
 to
 generate


more
 demand
 and
 more
 revenue?
 Like
 all


of
 that
 stuff
 takes
 GPUs
 to
 build
 out.


All
 that
 stuff
 takes
 data
 centers
 and


eventually
 the
 ROI
 which
 is
 you
 know


again
 it's
 still
 a
 question
 should


manifest
 itself
 and
 you
 either
 believe


there
 will
 be
 an
 ROI
 or
 you
 don't.
 And


then
 the
 secondary
 derivative
 question


is
 if
 if
 if
 you
 think
 there
 is
 an
 ROI


then
 are
 you
 paying
 a
 reasonable


multiple
 for
 these
 names?
 And
 I
 can


understand
 that
 people
 that
 think


pounder
 and
 Tesla's
 multiples
 are


aggressive.
 But
 again,
 Meta
 at
 20
 times,


Google
 at
 27
 times,
 Microsoft
 at
 32


times,
 those
 are
 not
 unreasonable


multiples,
 which
 is
 why
 it
 makes
 me
 feel


more
 confident
 to
 say
 we
 are
 not
 in
 a


bubble
 because
 the
 multiples
 are
 not
 as


egregious.


And
 Gemini
 was
 already
 great.
 Yeah.
 And


the
 fact,
 you
 know,
 that
 this
 is
 this
 is


the
 the
 worst
 AI
 is
 ever
 going
 to
 be,


which
 also
 is
 very
 exciting
 because
 that


just
 means
 the
 the
 best
 is
 yet
 to
 come,


which
 requires
 a
 ton
 of
 buildout,
 but


that
 also
 means
 we
 should
 be
 seeing
 a


lot
 more
 margin
 enhancement
 and
 ROI
 long


term


if
 we
 get
 better
 models.
 Walmart
 CEO
 is


stepping
 down.
 Uh,
 was
 the
 street
 upset


about
 that?
 Walmart,
 Walmart
 down
 2%.


He
 was
 there
 for
 a
 long
 Doug
 McMillan,


right?
 He
 was
 there
 for
 a
 while.


Walmart's
 also
 defensive
 though
 as
 it's


going
 red.


Um,


open
 is
 up
 3%.
 Do
 you
 think
 that
 was a


fake
 pump?
 I
 have
 no
 idea.
 But
 again,


that's
 why
 I
 said
 a
 couple
 minutes
 ago
 I


would
 not
 be
 surprised
 if
 we
 whipsaw


back
 down
 for
 no
 other
 reason
 other
 than


there
 was
 no
 reason
 to
 go
 down
 in
 the


pre-market.
 No
 reason
 to
 go
 up
 that


quick.
 Might
 not
 be
 any
 reason
 to
 go


down.
 So,


if
 you're
 buying
 the
 dip,
 if
 you're


selling
 into
 this,
 if
 you're
 kind
 of


hedging,
 navigating,
 you
 just
 I


personally
 think
 we
 are
 not
 out
 of
 the


woods.


And
 we
 could
 easily
 go
 back
 down
 for
 the


same
 reason
 we
 easily
 went
 back
 up,


which
 is
 that
 there
 is
 no
 reason.
 And


you
 know,
 that's
 just
 the
 nature
 of


volatility
 that
 we're
 all
 dealing
 with


right
 now.


But
 time
 will
 tell
 throughout
 the
 day
 if


it
 ends
 up
 being
 a
 pump
 that
 can
 sustain


itself.


Door
 Dash
 up
 4%.
 This
 one
 got
 hit
 as


well


uh


after
 their
 earnings.


So
 that
 one
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 recovery


there
 4.3%.
 There
 is
 no
 world
 where
 we


can
 go
 to
 without
 AI.
 I
 also
 agree
 with


that.
 I
 mean
 it
 is
 very
 hard
 to
 imagine


going
 back
 to
 world
 without
 AI.


Even
 just
 my
 Tesla,
 right?
 like
 just


when
 I
 go
 for
 a
 drive
 every
 week
 and
 it


drives
 me,
 it's
 just
 like


it
 is
 it
 is
 hard
 to
 imagine
 going
 back


to
 a
 world
 without
 that.
 And
 that
 and


self-driving
 is
 in
 the
 very
 early


innings
 whether
 it's
 Tesla,
 Whimo,


whatever
 company
 ends
 up
 really
 winning


in
 that
 space.
 It's
 going
 to
 require
 a


lot
 of
 compute
 capacity
 to
 make
 that


actually
 meaningful.
 And
 that's
 why
 you


got
 Elon
 talking
 about
 we
 need
 to
 build


our
 own
 chip
 farm.
 You
 got
 people
 saying


it's
 a
 do
 bubble
 and
 all
 this
 stuff
 is


fake
 and
 Elon's
 like,
 "We
 need
 to
 build


our
 own
 chip
 farm
 because
 in
 the
 best


case
 scenario,
 Samsung
 can't
 actually


provide
 us
 with
 enough
 GPUs
 or
 with


enough
 chips
 in
 our
 infrastructure
 to


make
 sense
 of
 the
 GPUs
 that
 we
 have.


I
 mean,
 at
 that
 point,
 I
 think
 it's
 hard


to
 say
 it's
 fundamentally
 fake."
 Uh,
 we


got
 some
 Fed
 news
 right
 here.
 Let
 me


pull
 this
 up.
 Got
 some
 Fed
 speak.
 Let's


see
 what
 they're
 saying
 about
 this


December
 cut


and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> I
 think
 they
 feel
 that
 they
 can
 look


through
 tariffs
 as
 a
 one-off
 price


increase.
 So,
 they
 have
 to
 sort
 of
 see


what
 goes
 on.
 The
 inflation
 expectations


have
 been
 very
 under
 control.


>> Uh
 indeed,
 both
 uh
 on
 the
 upside
 and
 the


downside
 when
 we've
 been
 through
 the
 the


mill
 on
 on
 on
 CPI.
 We
 are
 getting
 some


breaking
 news
 out
 of
 the
 Fed.
 For
 that,


let's
 get
 to
 Steve
 Leeman.
 Hey,
 Steve.


>> Hey,
 Carl.
 Yeah,
 timing
 is
 everything.


You
 ask
 about
 Schmidt.
 We
 got
 Schmidt


here,
 Kansas
 City
 Fed
 President
 uh
 who


desented
 at
 the
 last
 meeting
 saying


monetary
 policy
 is
 modestly
 restrictive


and
 that
 he
 says
 is
 where
 it
 should
 be.


He
 suggests
 in
 the
 speech
 he's
 about
 to


give
 his
 intention
 to
 oppose
 additional


cuts
 again
 in
 December
 says
 he
 mine


could
 change
 but
 right
 now
 that's
 the


way
 he's
 leaning.
 Cuts
 he
 says
 won't


help
 the
 labor
 market
 much
 but
 could


have
 a
 lasting
 effects
 on
 inflation
 and


inflation
 expectations.
 He
 says
 it's
 too


high.
 Meanwhile,
 he
 says
 the
 economy


shows
 momentum.
 He
 sees
 strong


consumption
 and
 solid
 gains
 in
 capital


spending,
 a
 big
 part
 of
 his
 outlook


here.
 He
 hears
 continued
 concern
 from


his
 contacts
 in
 his
 district
 about
 the


pace
 of
 price
 increase
 and
 not
 just


about
 tariffs,
 health
 care
 costs,


insurance,
 electricity,
 a
 whole
 range
 of


things.
 And
 he
 sees
 inflation
 spreading.


The
 most
 recent
 data
 he
 says
 shows


inflation
 is
 above
 3%
 going
 to
 remain


there
 and
 spreading.
 and
 he's
 concerned


that
 persistent
 inflation
 could
 cause


this
 idea
 of
 price
 increases
 to
 become


ingrained
 in
 people's
 psyches
 and
 force


a
 sharper
 rate
 increase
 down
 the
 road.


Policy
 he
 says
 should


>> Did
 he
 just
 say
 it
 could
 force
 a
 sharper


rate
 increase
 down
 the
 board?


I
 mean
 again
 this
 is
 another
 reason
 I


mean
 the
 markets
 are
 kind
 of
 losing
 uh


that
 intraday
 high
 that
 we
 had.
 Part
 of


it
 is
 probably
 because
 of
 this
 guy's


comments
 right
 here.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 the
 Fed
 is
 looking
 or


caring
 about
 the
 labor
 market,
 but
 the


fact
 that
 they're
 even
 thinking
 of


suggesting
 a
 rate
 hike
 in
 this


environment
 means
 that
 they're
 picking


inflation
 over
 the
 labor
 market
 right


now
 being
 against
 demand
 growth
 right


now
 to
 relieve
 pricing
 pressure.
 And


quickly
 on
 this
 discussion
 you
 were


having
 about
 the
 labor
 market,
 this
 is


Schmidt's
 idea.
 He
 says
 it's
 cooling
 but


largely
 in
 balance.
 It
 reflects
 more


structural
 changes
 than
 cyclical


changes.
 and
 the
 payroll
 break
 even


rate,
 the
 one
 needed
 to
 keep
 the


unemployment
 rate
 from
 changing
 his


staff
 suggests
 is
 just
 around
 50,000.


And
 then
 one
 other
 observation
 he
 makes


which
 is
 a
 big
 part
 of
 his
 thinking
 and


other
 more
 hawkish
 members
 of
 the
 Fed,


they
 look
 around
 and
 they
 do
 not
 see


things
 indicating
 tight
 monetary
 policy


in
 equity
 markets
 being
 at
 or
 near


all-time
 highs,
 narrow
 corporate
 bond


spreads,
 and
 very
 uh
 robust
 high
 yield


issuance.
 guys.


>> Okay,
 so
 this
 gets
 at
 at
 the
 point
 I
 was


just
 making.
 I
 wonder
 if
 they're
 opening


themselves
 up
 here
 with
 arguments
 like


that
 to
 well,
 the
 Fed's
 just
 making


monetary
 policy
 then
 for


people
 who
 own
 stocks,
 people
 who
 are


investing
 in
 data
 centers,
 you
 know,


tech
 companies.
 He
 he
 cited
 the
 high


levels
 of
 capital
 spending,
 you
 know,


that
 that
 is
 not
 reflective
 of
 the


entire
 economy.
 And
 when
 you
 say
 it's


not
 that
 restrictive,
 you
 know,
 go
 tell


that
 to
 the
 now
 40-year-old
 first-time


home
 buyer.


Um,
 I
 I
 hear
 what
 you're
 saying,
 Sarah,


and
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 uh
 good


good
 ideas
 in
 that.
 I
 guess
 that
 he


would
 counter
 and
 the
 Hawks
 would


counter
 that
 they
 have
 to
 make
 policy


for
 the
 aggregate
 economy
 and
 they
 have


really
 just
 one
 tool.
 And
 if
 the
 capex


numbers
 are
 higher,
 regardless
 of


whether
 there's
 a
 single
 source
 to
 that


capex,
 the
 Fed
 has
 to
 react
 to
 the


aggregate
 number.
 If
 the
 overall
 GDP


numbers
 show
 growth,
 and
 we're
 going
 to


get
 a
 lot
 of
 data
 hopefully
 soon
 that


shows
 whether
 or
 not
 that
 is
 the
 case.


If
 the
 overall
 GDP
 data
 shows
 that


there's
 growth,
 even
 if
 only
 a
 few


sections
 or
 sectors
 of
 the
 economy
 are


part
 of
 that,


>> the
 Fed
 has
 to
 react
 to
 that
 aggregate


number.


>> I
 get
 it.
 Of
 course,


>> if
 there
 are
 individual
 sectors
 of
 the


economy,
 Sarah,
 that
 are
 showing


problems,
 that's
 more
 the
 providence
 of


the
 fiscal
 side.
 If
 they
 want
 to
 help


housing
 more,
 they
 can
 help
 housing


more.
 If
 they
 want
 to
 help
 nonI


investment
 more,
 well,
 they
 can
 help


nonAI
 investment.
 The
 Fed
 can't
 do
 that


by
 sector,


>> I
 guess.
 So,
 but
 they
 have
 one
 tool,
 and


their
 tool
 is
 interest
 rates.
 And
 what


do
 interest
 rates
 control?
 They
 control


mortgage
 rates.
 They
 control
 borrowing


rates
 and
 things
 like
 autos
 which
 is


also
 showing
 some
 stress
 and
 and
 other


parts
 of
 you
 know
 consumer
 economy.


Part
 of
 their
 mandate
 is
 to
 address
 the


labor
 market
 which
 has
 shown
 signs
 of


weakness.
 So
 I
 don't know
 I
 guess
 you


can
 make
 this
 argument
 on
 both
 sides


which
 is
 why
 it's
 so
 fascinating
 going


into
 this
 meeting.
 Steve
 I
 wonder
 so
 it


sounds
 like


>> fascinating
 is
 one
 word
 to
 put
 it.
 I


mean
 confusing
 would
 be
 my
 word
 because


again
 and
 correct
 me
 if
 I'm
 wrong
 but


all
 of
 us
 were
 here
 three
 Wednesdays
 ago


listening
 to
 JPAL
 say
 that
 they
 are
 more


concerned
 about
 the
 downside
 risk
 to
 the


labor
 market
 over
 the
 upside
 risk
 to


inflation.
 He
 also
 to
 his
 credit
 did
 say


don't
 expect
 a
 December
 cut
 which
 kind


of
 started
 all
 of
 this
 uh
 downside


pressure
 and
 kind
 of
 confusion
 in
 the


market
 because
 JPA
 was
 so
 explicit
 about


no
 December
 cut
 but
 he
 said
 the
 labor


market
 is
 the
 bigger
 concern
 and
 then


over
 the
 past
 three
 weeks
 three


headlines
 that
 that
 were
 kind
 of
 the


main
 ones
 and
 there's
 a
 lot
 more
 than


that
 but
 Amazon
 30,000
 layoffs
 Verizon


15,000
 layoffs
 UPS
 48,000
 layoffs


I
 don't
 understand
 as
 a
 Fed
 how
 you
 can


be
 more
 concerned
 about
 the
 labor
 market


see
 those
 types
 of
 headlines
 which
 are


not
 just
 headlines,
 by
 the
 way.
 We
 spent


some
 time
 watching
 people
 make
 their


layoff
 videos
 to
 kind
 of
 humanize
 what


has
 actually
 happened.
 Like
 those
 people


legitimately
 got
 laid
 off.
 And
 then
 you


see
 subprime
 auto
 picking
 up
 as
 Sarah


was
 saying.
 You're
 seeing
 housing
 prices


continue
 to
 go
 higher.
 Like
 you
 see
 all


of
 that
 and
 say,
 "Oh
 no,
 we
 are
 too


restrictive.
 We
 need
 to
 hike."


Like
 I'm
 sympathetic
 to
 the
 argument


that
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 cut
 rates
 to
 1%


tomorrow.
 The
 idea
 that
 25
 bips
 is
 going


to
 explode
 inflation
 after
 three
 weeks


ago
 citing
 that
 inflation
 was
 not
 the


primary
 concern
 is
 asinine.
 It
 is


unbelievable
 that
 that
 is
 the
 pivot
 that


the
 Fed
 is
 going
 through
 and
 and
 it


really
 makes
 you
 question
 how
 could
 they


possibly
 be
 justifying
 it?
 How
 could


inflation
 be
 that
 dramatically
 higher


that
 or
 the
 perception
 of
 it
 is
 that


dramatically
 higher
 that
 it's
 causing


the
 lack
 of
 uh
 the
 trajectory
 for
 a
 rate


cut?
 Unless
 I'm
 wrong
 and
 the
 inflation


data
 is
 well
 above
 expectations.
 I
 mean


like
 we're
 running
 at
 3%.
 Let's
 say
 it's


at
 like
 5%
 right
 now
 or
 3.9%
 or
 so.
 Like


let's
 say
 it's
 just
 so
 abhorent
 that
 the


Fed
 has
 no
 choice
 but
 to
 stop
 it
 in
 its


tracks.
 But
 is
 it
 like
 that?


I
 I
 I
 mean
 even
 if
 we
 get
 the
 data
 like


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 that
 intense


and
 so
 the
 question
 then
 becomes
 you


know
 do
 we
 sacrifice
 the
 labor
 market


for
 that


pricing
 is
 back
 to
 Jan
 of
 2024
 that's


correct
 and
 that
 would
 be
 very
 very


weird
 to
 imagine
 if
 it
 ends
 up
 playing


out
 in
 that
 same
 in
 that
 same
 trajectory


Ethereum
 right
 here
 3161
 just
 went
 red


on
 the
 day


is
 that
 one
 gets
 hit.
 Cororeweave.


Cororeweave
 again,
 the
 other
 data
 center


plays
 are
 red,
 but
 they're
 not
 as
 red
 as


Cororeweave.
 Corweave
 uniquely,
 the


market
 is
 not
 loving
 what
 they're
 doing


with
 their
 debt.
 Cory,
 right?
 They're


7382.
 Palinger
 back
 down
 to
 170.
 Again,


a
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 green
 from
 the


pre-market
 lows,
 but
 they
 are
 getting


hit
 with
 some
 red
 candles


and
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 probably
 is
 from
 some


of
 the
 the
 Fed
 talk.


um
 what
 exactly
 happens
 if
 they
 decide


to
 cut
 rates.
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 if
 that


like
 saves
 the
 market
 or
 anything
 or
 if


that's
 like
 the
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 even
 talking


about
 rate
 cuts
 in
 the
 context
 of
 the


market.
 I'm
 talking
 about
 rate
 cuts
 in


the
 context
 of
 the
 economy
 because


eventually
 the
 economy
 catches
 up
 to
 the


market
 and
 we're
 kind
 of
 seeing
 that


with
 the
 labor
 market
 right
 now.
 If
 we


do
 not
 cut
 rates
 and
 people
 continue
 to


default
 on
 credit
 cards
 and
 subprime


auto
 and
 the
 overall
 capital
 spending


environment
 becomes
 significantly


reduced
 because
 of
 high
 rates
 or
 just


rates
 that
 are
 not
 affordable
 enough


then


that'll
 eventually
 show
 up
 in
 earnings.


Now
 if
 we
 don't
 get
 a
 rate
 cut
 like
 if


we
 do
 get
 a
 rate
 cut
 market
 doesn't
 have


to
 go
 to
 the
 moon
 but
 if
 we
 don't
 get
 a


rate
 cut
 it's
 definitely
 not
 going
 to


help
 the
 market
 stay
 where
 it
 is.
 That's


the
 asymmetry
 with
 the
 trajectory
 for


this
 rate
 cup.


Netflix
 is
 Netflix
 getting
 crushed


today?
 Netflix.
 Wow.
 3%
 down.
 I
 mean,


could
 the
 market
 be
 thinking
 that
 people


are
 uh


going
 to
 lose
 their
 jobs
 enough
 to
 the


point
 where
 they
 start
 selling
 off
 some


of
 these
 consumer
 subscription
 items?


Maybe
 that's
 a
 stretch,
 but
 not
 sure
 why


else
 Netflix
 would
 be
 down
 3.7%
 right


here.


Netflix
 down
 because
 they're
 in
 a


bidding
 war
 over
 Warner
 Bros.,
 you
 know,


that
 actually
 actually
 that
 makes
 sense


because
 Warner
 Bros.
 is
 up
 and
 Netflix


and
 Paramount
 and
 Comcast
 are
 down.


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 I
 think
 Warner
 Bros.
 has


some
 really
 good
 content
 with
 HBO
 Max.
 I


do
 think
 Netflix
 needs
 some
 of
 those


shows.


Uh
 Nvidia
 just
 went
 red,
 but
 do
 they


want
 to
 pay
 50
 billion
 for
 that?


True
 inflation
 is
 at
 2.5%.
 That
 is


correct.
 And
 true
 inflation
 has
 said


that
 um
 that
 the
 you
 know
 the
 price
 of


groceries
 are
 going
 up.
 It's
 it's


they're
 not
 denying
 that.


>> It's
 just
 you
 know
 is
 it
 going
 up
 to
 the


point
 where
 you
 sacrifice
 the
 labor


market.
 Let's
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 more


coverage
 on
 that
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep


going
 from
 there.


>> Like
 Schmidt
 and
 Collins
 would
 be


dissents
 if
 the
 Fed
 keeps
 cutting.


>> Yeah.
 [laughter]


I
 I'm
 fascinated
 by
 the
 pickle
 that
 uh


Powell
 is
 is
 in
 at
 the
 moment.
 Uh
 as
 I


game
 this
 out,
 I
 think
 he
 has
 five
 or


six
 potential
 descents
 here.
 You


mentioned
 some
 of
 those
 that
 were
 on
 the


fence.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 know,
 maybe
 by
 the
 way,
 Kashkari


last
 night,
 we
 could
 talk
 about
 next


year's
 board
 as
 well.
 Kashkari
 last


night
 said
 he
 did
 not
 support
 the


October
 rate
 cut
 even
 though
 he
 did
 not


have
 a
 vote.
 Bostic
 was
 similar
 in
 that


regard
 in
 terms
 of
 future
 cuts.
 So,
 but


in
 terms
 of
 voters,
 I
 think
 he
 could


have
 maybe
 four,
 maybe
 five
 descents
 for


a
 cut
 and
 he
 would
 almost
 certainly
 have


three
 for
 if
 he
 did
 not
 cut.
 So,
 this
 is


not
 good
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 way
 the


impression
 it
 gives.
 And
 I
 think
 the


only
 hope
 that
 he
 has
 right
 here
 is
 that


as
 you
 were
 suggesting,
 economic
 data


comes
 out,
 it's
 definitive
 one
 way
 or


the
 other.
 And
 that
 allows
 the
 Fed
 to


coalesce
 around
 a
 majority.


>> Gold
 down
 3%.


You're
 not
 seeing
 people
 go
 to
 gold
 for


safety.


Wow.
 First
 time
 I'm
 looking
 at
 it
 today.


Gold
 down
 2.7
 and
 then
 silver


down
 4.3.
 By
 the
 way,
 Tom
 Lee
 just


tweeted.
 He
 said,
 "Equity
 and
 credit


markets
 are
 protesting
 the
 hawkish
 Fed


talk.
 The
 December
 cut
 being
 up
 in
 the


air.
 This
 is
 why
 repo
 rates
 are
 rising.


The
 VIX
 are
 surging.
 Markets
 bullying


the
 Fed
 towards
 a
 December
 cut.
 Be


patient.
 This
 will
 resolve
 itself


positively."
 Kind
 of
 making
 the
 same


argument
 here
 around


the
 pickle
 that
 Powell
 is
 in
 and
 the


market's
 trying
 to
 bully
 him
 to
 give
 us


that
 cut


>> or
 much
 more
 clear
 majority
 decision.


>> I
 know.
 But
 what
 are
 we
 going to
 get?
 A


September
 jobs
 report.
 Hot
 or
 cold?
 It's


old.
 It's
 old
 news.


>> No,
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 I
 think
 we're


going
 to
 get
 November.
 We're
 going to


get
 the
 November
 jobs
 report.


>> And
 we
 will
 get
 I
 think
 it's


>> I
 check
 my
 calendar
 on
 this.
 I
 think
 um


uh
 No,
 we
 should
 get
 November
 before
 the


before
 the
 December
 meeting,
 I
 think.


Right.
 For
 the
 month
 of
 November.


October
 is
 the
 black
 hole
 that
 will


>> the
 black
 hole
 forever.
 Um
 where
 light


goes
 in
 and
 nothing
 comes
 out


apparently.
 Um
 uh
 we
 will
 also
 we
 also


get
 um
 uh
 the
 CPI
 report
 for
 December
 I


believe
 on
 the
 second
 day
 of
 the
 meeting


and
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 the
 TPI
 comes


out
 in
 that
 regard.
 I
 talked
 to
 somebody


at
 the
 BLS
 and
 this
 person
 was
 just


waiting
 for
 instructions.
 One
 of
 the


economists
 who
 heads
 one
 of
 the


divisions
 I
 had
 a
 background


conversation.
 He's
 like
 call
 back
 in
 a


little
 bit
 when
 I
 know
 something.


There's
 a
 page
 on
 the
 website
 that
 has


the
 heading
 for
 the
 dates
 for
 the
 new


releases,
 but
 the
 page
 is
 blank
 and
 I'm


refreshing
 it
 every
 other
 minute
 here.


>> That
 was
 supposed
 to
 be
 today,
 by
 the


way.
 PPI
 for
 November,
 November
 14th.


Thank
 you,
 Steve.


>> Steve,
 thanks.
 Let's
 continue
 that


conversation.


>> All
 right,
 the
 lack
 of
 clarity
 on
 this


December
 rate
 cut
 definitely
 creating


more
 pain.
 Um,


but
 again,
 we
 we
 are
 not
 S&P
 is
 almost


at
 highs
 of
 days.
 We
 are
 not
 really
 at


the
 levels
 we
 were
 at
 in
 the
 pre-market


or
 anywhere
 near
 that
 unless
 we
 were
 to


get
 a
 hit


going
 higher.


Um,


not
 seeing
 that
 yet.
 Here,
 here's


another
 thing
 I
 want
 to
 show
 people.


This
 is
 another
 chart
 that
 I
 saw


yesterday.
 I've
 never
 looked
 at
 this


indicator,
 but
 it
 is
 an
 indicator
 that's


important.
 So,
 there
 is
 something
 called


the
 move
 index.
 And
 the
 move
 index


measures
 the
 volatility
 of
 the
 US


Treasury
 market,
 indicating
 expected


fluctuations
 in
 interest
 rates.
 A
 high


index
 value
 suggests
 high
 uncertainty


and
 risk
 while
 a
 low
 value
 indicates
 a


more
 stable
 interest
 rate
 environment.


And
 so
 if
 you
 take
 a
 look
 at
 the
 the
 uh


the
 move
 index
 right
 here,


let
 me
 share
 this.
 You're
 not
 seeing


this
 massive
 spike


in
 volatility.
 If
 anything,
 it's
 been


down
 year
 to
 date
 18%.
 Got
 a
 bit
 of
 a


spike
 here
 in
 April.
 That's
 when
 it
 was


at
 137
 and
 the
 Fed
 was
 you
 know
 uh


that's
 when
 bond
 yields
 were
 at
 like
 5%


on
 the
 10
 year
 and
 the
 30-year
 and
 now


we're
 at
 79.
 There
 is
 that
 little


upswing
 from
 65
 to
 79.
 But
 you
 are
 not


seeing
 some
 dramatic
 increase
 in
 the


option
 volatility
 estimate
 for
 the


credit
 markets.
 This
 is
 not
 for
 the


stock
 market.
 This
 is
 for
 the
 overall
 um


economic
 landscape
 like
 like
 the
 VIX


tends
 to
 capture.
 This
 is
 just
 for


Treasury
 yields.
 And
 the
 fact
 that
 the


bond
 markets
 are
 not
 really
 screaming


even
 if
 equity
 markets
 are
 annoyed
 at


the
 lack
 of
 a
 cut
 is
 basically
 Wall


Street
 saying
 we're
 not
 really
 or
 at


least
 the
 private
 credit
 part
 of
 Wall


Street
 saying
 we're
 not
 really
 buying


into
 this.


At least
 not
 at
 the
 moment.
 Dan
 Ives
 is


on.
 Okay,
 let's
 go
 to
 Dan
 Ies
 and
 tell


us
 that
 it's
 2
 PM
 or
 2
 am
 at
 the
 party.


Let's
 uh
 let's
 see
 what
 Mr.
 Dan
 has
 to


say.
 you
 pound
 the
 table
 on
 on
 the
 tech


trade.
 You've
 been
 super
 bullish.
 Do
 you


not
 have
 concerns
 now
 about
 monetary


policy,
 you
 know,
 as
 as
 the
 market


rethinks
 the
 cut
 for
 December
 and
 and


the
 overall
 frothiness
 or
 valuations


around
 AI?


>> Yeah,
 look
 s
 I
 mean
 I
 get
 some
 of
 the


nervousness,
 but
 I
 mean
 I
 was
 just
 in


Egypt
 for
 three
 weeks


>> and
 demand
 to
 supply
 for
 chips
 are
 10


to1.
 Demand's
 increased
 call
 about
 30%


since
 June
 from
 what
 we
 see.
 you
 look
 at


hypers
 scale
 or
 this
 is
 a
 capex
 super


cycle.
 So
 it's
 my
 view
 if
 you're
 in
 the


second
 third
 inning
 to
 be
 sort
 of


bearish
 and
 nervous
 here.
 I
 just
 view
 it


as
 shortsighted
 because
 I
 think
 there's


a
 tech
 bull
 market
 that
 goes
 on
 for


another
 two
 years
 and
 I
 think
 these
 are


golden
 buying
 opportunities
 for
 the


names
 that
 I
 view
 where
 streets


underestimating
 numbers
 20
 30%
 over
 the


next
 12
 to
 18
 months.
 But
 do
 you
 think


there
 will
 be
 a
 point
 where
 the
 where


the
 capex
 should
 get
 more
 scrutinized
 um


or
 you
 know
 until
 the
 profitability


materializes
 to
 match
 the
 level
 of


spending?


>> Sure.
 And
 look
 and
 I
 get
 the
 scrutiny


like
 if
 you
 look
 obviously
 Meta
 and


Oracle
 and
 and
 you
 see
 some
 of
 the


worries
 there
 the
 circular
 financing
 in


terms
 of
 open
 AI
 but
 to
 me
 it's
 all


about
 you're
 building
 out
 a
 new
 economy


on
 the
 consumer
 on
 the
 enterprise
 front.


for
 every
 dollar
 they
 put
 on
 capbacks,


they're
 going
 to
 ultimately
 make
 eight


to$10
 dollars
 on
 that
 over
 the
 coming


years.
 So
 I
 just
 think
 that
 is
 the
 best


move
 for
 these
 companies
 in
 the
 arms


race.
 And
 that's
 why
 for
 Meta
 and
 that
 I


talk
 about
 that's
 a
 table
 pounder
 on


that
 stock
 and
 sell
 off.
 Oracle
 same


thing
 and
 you
 know
 so
 many
 times
 we've


talked
 about
 in
 your
 show
 like
 these
 are


the
 opportunities
 whether
 it's
 Deep
 Seek


or
 other
 moments
 and
 then
 investors
 are


like
 I
 missed
 it
 but
 these
 will
 be
 the


opportunities.
 I
 think
 you're
 going
 to


have
 a
 massive
 tech
 rally
 into
 year
 end.


>> You
 can
 tell
 the
 uh
 fire
 in
 Dan's
 voice


right
 here.
 He
 is
 not
 taking
 any
 of
 this


BS
 around
 a
 bare
 market.
 I
 mean,
 he
 is


straight
 up
 saying,
 "Nope,
 these
 are
 the


moments.
 You
 take
 advantage
 of
 it


because
 nothing
 structurally
 has
 broken


in
 the
 overall
 secular
 bull
 market


thesis
 around
 AI."


>> Dan,
 Oracle
 is
 a
 great
 example.
 Uh
 what


explains
 that
 early
 September
 gap


getting
 filled
 as
 we
 are
 back
 to
 the
 200


day
 here
 for
 the
 first
 time
 since
 June?


>> Yeah,
 Carl,
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 worries


about
 debt
 taking
 on
 financing
 capex


depreciation
 the
 open
 AI
 pop
 like
 did


they
 get
 over
 their
 skis?
 And
 actually
 I


disagree.
 I
 think
 Oracle
 this
 is
 this
 is


a
 massive
 renaissance
 that
 they're
 going


to
 see.
 I
 mean,
 you
 talk
 about
 they're


2%
 penetrated
 within
 their
 install
 base


when
 it
 comes
 to
 AI.
 Everything
 they're


doing
 are
 the
 right
 moves.
 And
 I
 think


this
 selloff
 here,
 we're
 going
 to
 look


back
 three,
 six,
 nine
 months
 from
 now,


and
 this
 was
 just,
 I
 think,
 a
 golden


bond
 opportunity
 to
 own
 Oracle.
 And
 I


think
 right
 now,
 the
 nervousness
 is


coming
 out,
 but
 it
 just
 comes
 back
 to
 3%


of
 US
 enterprises
 have
 gone
 down
 the
 AI


path.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 goes
 to
 20%
 over


the
 next
 18
 24
 months.
 That's
 what


you're
 playing
 for
 especially
 in
 the


second,
 third,
 fourth
 derivatives.
 We


see
 it
 cyber
 security.
 I
 see
 human
 proof


authentication.
 I
 see
 it
 on,
 you
 know,


infrastructure,
 nemesis,
 core,
 even


others.


>> Does
 that
 view
 extend
 to
 Tesla,
 which
 as


we
 said
 earlier
 this
 morning
 is
 now
 red


for
 the
 year
 and
 worst
 performing
 mag
 7.


I
 think
 actually
 Tesla
 is
 probably
 of


all
 of
 these
 names
 that's
 probably
 the


one
 to
 me
 that
 sticks
 out
 the
 most


because
 in
 my
 opinion
 the
 future
 about


autonomous
 and
 robotics
 Musk
 obviously


right
 now
 wartime
 CEO
 you
 look
 at
 the


coming
 years
 I
 think
 Tesla's
 the
 two


trillion
 and
 ultimately
 $3
 trillion


market
 cap
 because
 autonomous


80%
 autonomous
 I
 think
 Tesla's
 going
 to


own.
 So
 I
 get
 the
 stock
 selling
 off
 here


because
 you
 can't
 see
 the
 numbers.
 But
 I


mean
 this
 is
 something
 where
 I
 look
 out


600's
 base
 case,
 800's
 bull
 case.
 And


Carl,
 that's
 my
 view.
 I
 mean
 I
 think


this
 is
 only
 like
 I
 talked
 about
 this
 is


just
 the
 early
 days
 of
 a
 fourth


industrial
 revolution.
 And
 for
 the
 first


time
 in
 30
 years,
 the
 US
 is
 the
 head
 of


China
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 tech.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 that
 that
 that's
 the
 bull


case,
 Dan.
 So
 aren't
 there
 going
 to
 be


winners
 and
 losers?
 Sounds
 like
 you
 like


all
 of
 the
 big
 players.


Yeah.
 And
 s
 there's
 gonna
 be
 lo
 I
 if
 you


Adobe
 are
 they
 a
 loser?
 If
 you
 look
 at


like
 you
 know
 some
 of
 the
 other
 sort
 of


large
 cap
 names
 like
 they're
 trying
 to


sort
 of
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 Salesforce
 you


know
 could
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 winner
 but


they're
 obviously
 under
 a
 lot
 of


pressure
 from
 a
 software
 perspective.


You
 know
 you
 look
 at
 some
 of
 the


infrastructure
 plays
 like
 a
 Cisco


they're
 turning
 it
 around.
 I
 think
 it's


really
 more
 about
 the
 second
 third


fourth
 derivatives
 in
 software.
 I
 look


at
 names
 like
 Nebas.
 I
 look
 at
 names


like
 Corewave
 and
 the
 selloff
 because


it's
 all
 to
 me
 about
 for
 every
 dollar


and
 this
 is
 the
 most
 important.
 For


every
 dollar
 spent
 on
 Nvidia
 chip,


there's
 an
 8
 to10
 multiplier
 across
 the


rest
 of
 tech.
 Three
 trillion
 that's


going
 to
 be
 spent
 in
 the
 next
 two
 years,


>> right?
 So
 who
 So
 but
 but
 you
 in
 your


view
 it's
 all
 the
 hyperscalers
 that
 are


the
 winners.
 The
 Amazons,
 the
 Google's,


the
 Microsoft,
 Meta
 you
 said
 is
 a
 table


pounder.
 So
 everybody
 that's
 spending


big
 now,


>> but
 I
 view
 it
 as
 if
 they're
 not


spending,
 I
 actually
 view
 it
 as
 a


negative.
 Like
 if
 if
 Meta
 ultimately


pull
 back
 and
 they
 raise
 numbers
 for


next
 year
 and
 they
 cut
 capbacks,
 I
 would


view
 that
 as
 a
 huge
 negative
 because


Zuckerberg
 right
 now
 wartime
 CEO


building
 out
 what
 could
 be
 monetization


an
 incremental
 40
 50%
 on
 advertising
 on


the
 consumer
 side
 and
 even
 as
 they
 build


out
 on
 the
 glasses
 on
 the
 hardware
 side.


That's
 the
 smart
 move
 for
 Meta.
 I
 also


look
 at
 names
 like
 when
 you
 think
 about


we've
 talked
 about
 in
 the
 power
 side


nuclear
 names
 like
 AO
 and
 others
 I
 mean


this
 all
 is
 about
 the
 second
 or
 fourth


derivatives
 people
 think
 that
 this
 is


sort
 of
 a
 white
 knuckle
 clock
 strikes


midnight
 moment
 I've
 talked
 about
 this


is
 nowhere
 near
 a
 bubble
 it's
 a
 1996


moment
 not
 a
 1999
 2000
 bubble
 moment


>> is
 there
 any
 demarcation
 line
 between


names
 you
 would
 like
 and
 not
 like
 a


great
 example


where
 you're
 either
 talking
 about
 no


profits
 or
 in
 some
 cases
 in
 quantum
 for


example
 minimal
 revenue.


>> Sure.
 Yeah.
 And
 car
 I
 think
 that's
 what


you
 have
 to
 be
 selective
 in
 terms
 of


like
 the
 winners
 and
 who
 ultimately
 is


going
 to
 be
 there.
 I
 think
 there's
 going


to
 be
 other
 nuclear
 plays,
 right?


There's
 going to
 be
 other
 power
 plays


out
 there.
 It
 if
 I
 see
 the
 demand
 is


shown
 in
 cracks
 and
 I
 see
 customers


cutting
 back,
 the
 ROI
 is
 not
 there,
 use


cases
 aren't
 exploding,
 then
 we
 get


negative.
 But
 to
 some
 extent
 it's
 the


opposite.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 where
 we
 are


right
 now
 and
 I
 just
 think
 like
 globally


given
 where
 US
 tech
 is
 this
 continues
 to


be
 what
 you
 want
 to
 own
 and
 I
 think
 for


the
 winners
 and
 and
 look
 if
 you
 focus


just
 on
 valuation
 one
 year
 out
 two
 year


out
 you
 missed
 every
 transformational


tech
 stock
 the
 last
 20
 years
 and
 that's


why
 I
 focus
 on
 we
 talk
 about
 in
 our
 odds


they a
 30
 like
 who
 are
 the
 winners
 in


the
 different
 sectors.


>> All
 right
 Dan
 make
 a
 fullthroated
 case.


Thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 joining
 us.
 We


appreciate
 it.
 Dan
 eyes
 from
 Wedbush.


Look,


>> Dan
 has
 been
 saying
 the
 same
 thing
 for


the
 past
 two
 and
 a
 half
 years.
 And
 so
 he


is
 just
 reiterating
 the
 core
 argument


around
 the
 idea
 that
 demand
 is


outstripping
 supply
 and
 as
 a
 result


you're
 going
 to
 see
 earnings
 growth.


Wow.
 669
 on
 the
 S&P
 very
 close
 to
 670


right
 there.
 Um
 and
 again
 the
 last
 thing


I
 think
 Dan
 said
 was
 the
 most
 important.


He
 was
 like,
 "Look,
 if
 we
 don't
 see
 the


ROI,
 if
 we
 don't
 see
 the
 level
 of


buildout
 leading
 to
 anything
 meaningful,


that's
 when
 you
 get
 negative."
 But
 the


opposite
 is
 happening.
 We're
 seeing
 the


exact
 opposite.
 Yet,
 people
 are
 getting


negative,
 which
 is
 the
 sort
 of


irrational
 disconnect
 that
 happens
 time


and
 time
 again
 in
 the
 market.
 And
 that's


why
 he's
 so
 uh
 bullish
 on
 the
 idea
 of


just
 like,
 okay,
 this
 is
 an
 opportunity


at
 that
 point
 if
 the
 data
 doesn't
 match


the
 reality.


Robin
 Hood
 as
 well
 going
 green
 again.


Hoodie
 from
 112
 to
 123
 almost


12240


on
 the
 day.


S&P
 did
 not
 touch
 670.
 Did
 it?
 No,
 got


really
 close.
 6696.


Rocket
 Lab
 goes
 green.
 Dwave's
 up
 3%.


Iren's
 down
 two.
 Nebus
 only
 down
 three.


AMD
 is
 barely
 red.
 Nvidia,
 are
 we
 still


green
 on
 Nvidia?
 We
 are
 slightly
 green.


Just
 below
 187,


but
 we
 are
 indeed
 green.
 Tesla
 touched


400.
 Really?
 Oh,
 Tesla
 got
 ugly
 in
 the


pre-market,
 dude.
 Tesla,
 look
 at
 that.


399
 400
 on
 Tesla.
 Got
 to
 382


in
 the
 pre-markets.


It
 is
 10:30.
 Maybe
 it's
 10:30
 recovery


instead
 of
 10:30
 slam.


There
 it
 is.
 670
 on
 the
 S&P.
 All right.


So,
 we
 are
 3%
 away.
 672.
 We
 go
 green
 on


the
 day.
 672.


And
 if
 we
 go
 green
 on
 the
 S&P,
 you
 see
 a


lot
 of
 these
 names
 are
 going
 to
 catch


up.
 Nvidia
 and
 Hood
 already


starting
 to
 try
 to
 catch
 up
 with
 the


S&P.
 I
 think
 most
 people
 portfolios
 are


very
 close
 to
 going
 green
 on
 the
 day.


669.84
 84


trying
 to
 break
 out
 and
 hold
 above
 670.


So
 now
 if
 we
 were
 to
 go
 down
 to
 uh
 the


663
 lows
 of
 the
 pre-market
 or
 of
 like


935,


you
 would
 basically
 need
 to
 see
 a
 one


and
 a
 half%
 one
 and a
 half%
 decline
 from


here


which
 is
 possible.


It's
 just
 a
 question
 of,
 you
 know,
 do


the
 sellers
 come
 in
 at
 that
 level
 and


for
 what
 reason
 would
 they
 be
 more


excited
 to
 sell?
 Meta
 right
 there,
 609.


Look
 at
 Meta.
 That's
 was
 at
 598
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 Again,
 pre-markets,
 there's


low
 volume,
 but
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people


that
 get
 scared.
 That
 could
 have
 created


a
 lot
 of
 selling.
 And
 then
 Micro


Strategy
 right
 there,
 199.


That's
 down
 4%.


Portfolio's
 cooking
 after
 being
 cooked.


Oh
 my
 gosh,
 dude.


Oh,
 we
 can
 hold
 670
 on
 the
 day.
 This


would
 definitely
 not
 be
 the
 worst
 way
 to


end
 out
 on
 Friday.


SMCI
 up
 2.5.


Soundhound
 green,


doggy,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 five
 gifted.


Appreciate
 you,
 man.
 Paul,
 thank
 you
 as


well
 for
 the
 one
 gifted.
 Five
 of
 you


guys.
 Jack,
 you
 got
 a
 membership.
 Hans,


you
 got
 a
 membership.
 Krishna,
 you
 got
 a


membership.
 Jim,
 you
 got
 a
 membership.


And
 Ty
 Gordon,
 you
 got
 a
 membership


as
 a
 result
 of
 Mr.
 Douggee
 Dallas.


Open
 doors
 going
 green
 as
 well.


Micron
 up
 5%.
 Dude.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 all


right.
 So,
 obviously


buyer
 stepping
 in
 on
 this.


You're
 not
 letting
 her
 go
 down
 as
 bad
 as


it
 was
 in
 the
 pre-market,
 dude.
 I
 mean,


if
 you
 woke
 up
 at
 around
 like
 6:30
 and


you
 looked
 at
 your
 portfolio,
 it
 was


just
 like
 the
 n
 like
 the
 numbers
 were


just
 laughable.
 It's
 like
 it's
 like
 in


the
 Joker
 in
 the
 Dark
 Knight
 when
 he


just
 starts
 laughing
 even
 though
 he


keeps
 getting
 punched
 because
 it's
 like


at
 some
 point
 you
 just
 laugh.
 You're


just
 like,
 "Oh,
 it's
 this
 bad.
 All
 I
 can


do
 is
 laugh."


And
 you
 know
 that
 that's
 what
 some
 of


those
 prices
 look
 like.
 And
 usually
 when


it's
 to
 that
 point,
 which
 is
 what
 it
 was


during
 April,
 you
 don't
 sell
 because


it's
 like
 it's
 so
 hilarious
 that
 one


could
 argue
 maybe
 this
 is
 not
 reality.


I'm
 not
 saying
 we
 can't
 get
 back
 there,


but
 that's
 definitely
 kind
 of
 what
 it


felt
 like


in
 the
 pre-markets.
 Grab
 right
 there.


546
 UNH


still
 down
 3%
 on
 the
 day.


Hans
 says,
 "I'm
 crying,
 not
 laughing."


Oh
 my
 gosh.
 Tess,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 five


gifted.
 Appreciate
 you
 as
 well.


Um,
 Corey,
 you
 got
 a
 membership.
 Andy,


you
 got
 a
 membership.
 Braden,
 you
 got
 a


membership.


Justin,
 you
 got
 a
 membership.


And
 Paul,
 you
 got
 a
 membership
 as
 well.


Thank
 you,
 Tess,


for
 those
 gifted
 five.
 Google
 trying
 to


go
 green.


The
 googs


and
 then
 Nvidia
 really
 getting
 a
 move


now.
 18735.
 Again,
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 what


we
 were
 talking
 about
 last
 night
 as


well.
 It's
 just
 like
 all
 of
 us,
 Chris,


me,
 Steve,
 Douggee,
 Austin,
 all
 of
 us,


even
 if
 we
 have
 different
 perspectives


on
 individual
 stocks,
 the
 consensus
 was


this
 is
 not


2022
 where
 you
 had
 fundamental


structural
 paradigm
 shifts
 in
 the


economy
 that
 created
 the
 19%
 draw
 down


that
 we
 saw.
 Also
 remember
 2022
 happened


after
 printing
 $8
 trillion


in
 less
 than
 a
 year
 and
 having
 interest


rates
 at
 zero.
 Like
 like
 when
 people
 try


to
 compare
 the
 time
 frame
 to
 now
 pounder


by
 the
 way
 174


like
 you
 can
 point
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 different


things
 you're
 upset
 about
 and
 that
 there


are
 cracks
 and
 there
 things
 are
 toppy


yada
 yada
 like
 those
 are
 all
 valid


criticisms
 but
 to
 say
 structurally
 we


are
 coming
 off
 of
 trillions
 of
 dollars


of
 stimulus
 and
 rates
 that
 were
 at
 zero


meaning
 literally
 you
 have
 to
 put
 your


money
 in
 anything
 other
 than
 the
 bank


account
 or
 a
 money
 market
 fund
 to
 get
 at


least
 some
 level
 of
 return.
 Of
 course


that
 was
 going
 to
 create
 an
 inflation


epidemic
 and
 of
 course
 that
 was
 going
 to


lead
 to
 massive
 overhiring
 and
 of
 course


that
 was
 going
 to
 lead
 to
 negative


earnings
 growth.
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 what


the
 similarity
 is
 between
 now
 and
 then


if
 I
 had
 to
 compare
 the
 two


and
 and
 if
 there
 is
 some
 massive


similarity
 then
 I
 would
 be
 curious
 to


find
 out
 how
 h
 how
 is
 that
 similarity


actually
 taking
 itself
 into
 the
 stock


market
 because
 what
 we've
 seen
 what
 we


saw
 in
 2020
 was
 you
 could
 put
 up
 you


could
 say
 hey
 like
 the
 Wall
 Street
 could


be
 like
 hey
 like
 what
 what
 is
 your
 EPS


and
 and and
 you
 could
 say
 oh
 well
 we
 we


have
 a
 cup
 of
 pudding
 as
 our
 earnings


per
 share


and
 Wall
 Street
 be
 like,
 "Wow,
 that's
 a


nice
 cup
 of
 pudding,
 20%."
 Like
 that,


like
 that's
 literally
 what
 was
 happening


in
 2020
 for
 those
 that
 were
 actually


trading
 during
 that
 time
 or
 even


remember
 what
 it
 was
 like
 buying
 the


stock.
 Now,
 you
 could
 say,
 "Well,
 we


have
 a
 five
 course
 meal."
 And
 Wall


Street's
 like,
 "Well,


you
 know,
 steak's
 a
 little
 a
 little


overcooked,
 even
 though
 it's
 a
 really


nice
 steak.
 You
 know,
 you're
 down
 30%."


Which
 is
 what
 Robin
 had
 did.
 I
 mean,


Robinage
 is
 one
 of
 the
 best
 quarters


I've
 ever
 seen
 in
 a
 company
 falls
 from


140
 to
 110.
 Like,


anything
 they
 can
 nitpick
 off
 of
 a
 great


quarter.
 So,
 this
 is
 not
 the
 same
 time


in
 a
 in
 in
 a
 in
 a
 euphoric
 top.
 You
 are


putting
 out
 horrible
 numbers
 and
 the


street
 is
 rewarding
 it.
 Right
 now,
 these


companies
 are
 putting
 up
 amazing


numbers.
 The
 street
 is
 not
 even
 giving


them
 the
 benefit
 of
 the
 doubt.
 Now


granted,
 a
 lot
 of these
 stocks
 have


already
 run,
 but
 still


I
 think
 that's
 the
 difference
 between


now
 and
 2022
 as
 well.


We
 have
 a
 Trump
 tweet.


Um,


no,
 it's
 Oh,
 no.
 We
 got
 it
 again.
 Okay,


here
 we
 go.
 Um,
 Trump
 tweet.
 Now
 that


the
 Democrats
 are
 using
 the
 Epstein
 hoax


involving
 Democrats
 and
 not
 Republicans


to
 try
 and
 deflect
 from
 their
 disastrous


shutdowns
 and
 all
 their
 failures,
 I
 will


be
 asking
 Pam
 Bondi
 and
 the
 DOJ
 together


with
 our
 great
 patriots
 at
 the
 FBI
 to


investigate
 Jeffrey
 Epstein's


involvement
 and
 relationship
 with
 Bill


Clinton,
 Larry
 Summers,
 Reed
 Hoffman,
 JP


Morgan,
 Chase,
 and
 many
 other
 people
 in


in
 institutions
 to
 determine
 what
 was


going
 on
 with
 him
 and
 and
 them.
 This
 is


another
 Russia
 scam
 with
 all
 arrows


pointing
 to
 the
 Democrats.
 Records
 show


that
 these
 men
 and
 many
 others
 spent


large
 portions
 of
 their
 life
 with


Epstein
 and
 on
 the
 island.
 Stay
 tuned.


Oh
 [ __ ]


[laughter]


Oh
 [ __ ]


Um,


hold
 on.
 I
 have
 to
 I
 have
 to
 hold
 on.
 I


gotta
 just


I
 gotta
 just
 This
 is
 This
 is
 the


reaction
 to
 that
 tweet.
 This
 is
 the


reaction
 to
 that
 tweet.
 She
 said,
 "What


did
 your
 mother
 say?"
 I
 took
 a
 deep


breath.
 I
 looked
 at
 my
 friends.
 I
 was


like,
 "It's
 about
 to
 go
 down."


>> Oh,
 boy.
 All right.
 So
 for
 Trump
 to
 try


to
 deflect
 from
 the
 Epstein
 stuff,


essentially
 he's
 saying,
 "I'm
 going
 to


investigate
 you
 guys
 now.


And
 if
 you
 guys
 really
 want
 to
 put
 me
 on


the
 pressure
 seat,
 let's
 put
 Bill


Clinton
 up
 there.
 Let's
 put
 Larry


Summers
 up
 there.
 Let's
 put
 Reed
 Hoffman


up
 there."
 Does
 the
 market
 like
 it?
 Hold


on.
 Are
 we
 going
 green?
 Oh,
 if
 we
 go


green
 on
 this
 tweet.
 Oh
 my
 goodness.
 We


are
 a
 dollar
 away
 from
 going.
 We
 are.


[laughter]


[gasps]


We're
 at
 intraday
 highs.
 I
 I
 think
 we


literally
 just
 pumped
 on
 that
 tweet.


I
 mean,
 I
 think
 we
 literally
 just
 pumped


it.

Trump
 just
 said,
 "If
 you
 guys
 want
 to
 go


after
 me,
 I'm
 going
 to
 use
 the
 entire


Department
 of
 Justice
 to
 investigate


Bill
 Clinton,
 Larry
 Summers,
 Reed


Hoffman,
 and
 JP
 Morgan
 Chase
 and
 their


ties
 to
 Epstein."


Holy
 [ __ ]
 dude.


By
 the
 way,
 um


there
 is
 ample
 evidence
 just
 in
 the


ether
 for
 anyone
 who's
 even
 kind
 of
 kept


up
 with
 the
 Jeffrey
 Epstein.
 I
 don't


have
 to
 be
 an
 ultimate
 historian
 about


what's
 been
 going
 on
 here,
 but
 if
 you've


even
 kind
 of
 kept
 up
 with
 it,
 those
 are


the
 names
 that
 have
 popped
 up
 time
 and


time
 again.
 Bill
 Clinton,


literally,
 you
 have
 eyewitnesses
 saying


he
 was
 on
 the
 island.
 Reed
 Hoffman,
 Reed


Hoffman
 introduced
 many
 people
 to


Jeffrey
 Epstein.
 And
 then
 Jeffrey


Epstein
 did
 a
 lot
 of
 business
 with
 JP


Morgan
 Chase
 and
 Deutsche
 Bank.
 That
 was


another
 institution.
 So,
 and
 Larry


Summers
 all
 he's
 in
 all
 these
 emails.


So,


I
 mean,
 if
 you
 were
 to
 have
 a
 full-on


investigation
 there,
 you
 have
 some
 very


powerful
 people
 and
 institutions
 that


probably
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 investigated.


And
 I
 imagine
 Trump
 doesn't
 want
 to
 be


investigated
 either.
 So
 what
 he's
 doing


right
 here
 is
 a
 game
 of
 chess
 and


basically
 saying
 if
 you
 guys
 re
 what


he's
 doing
 right
 here,
 this
 is
 my


interpretation
 is
 he's
 telling
 Bill


Clinton,
 Reed
 Hoffman,
 Larry
 Summers,


which
 are
 very
 influential
 in
 the


Democratic
 party
 to
 go
 tell
 the


Democrats
 to
 sit
 the
 f
 down.
 That
 is


what
 he's
 implicitly
 telling
 them
 right


now
 with
 this
 tweet.


Because
 if
 this
 full-on
 investigation


does
 happen,
 it's
 almost
 like
 if
 Trump


knows
 he's
 going
 down,
 he's
 not
 going


down
 alone
 on
 this
 ship.


And
 the
 market
 loves
 it.

Dude,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 lie.
 And
 put
 in


the
 chat,
 did
 anyone
 expect
 that
 would


be
 the
 pivot
 he
 plays?
 I
 will
 admit


1,000%
 I
 had
 no
 clue
 he
 would
 go
 that


route.
 I
 quite
 frankly
 thought
 he
 was
 a


bit
 hooked
 on
 this
 Epstein
 thing.
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 lie.
 Thought
 he
 was
 a
 bit


cooked
 on
 this,
 especially
 if
 the
 Senate


uh
 Republicans
 vote
 on
 releasing
 the


files.


And
 I'm
 not
 saying
 he
 still
 can't
 be


cooked
 on
 this,
 but
 if
 the
 pivot
 is


telling
 billionaire
 Democrats
 to
 go
 get


everyone
 to
 not
 vote
 for
 this
 because
 of


whatever
 influence
 they
 have,
 that
 that


definitely
 turns
 a
 bit
 of
 the
 tables


here.


He
 still
 could
 be
 cooked,


but
 this
 is
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 pivot.

 six.
 It's
 the
 only
 card
 he


can
 play.


I
 mean,
 it
 definitely
 feels
 like
 that,


right?
 It
 definitely
 feels
 like
 it's
 the


only
 card
 he
 can
 play.
 I
 mean,
 the
 fact


that
 he
 is
 straight
 up
 saying,
 "All


right,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 do
 the
 Epstein


thing,
 then
 let's
 get
 down
 the
 Epstein


road
 and
 let's
 have
 the
 entire
 DOJ
 focus


on
 this
 issue,
 which
 means
 it
 will
 be


headline
 news
 every
 single
 freaking
 day


if
 the
 DOJ
 starts
 making
 an


investigation.
 I
 mean,
 the
 the
 the
 the


strategy
 five
 months
 ago
 was
 to
 like


just
 deflect
 and
 ignore,
 and
 it
 worked.


But
 now
 that
 it's
 brought
 back
 into
 the


limelight,
 it's
 almost
 like
 Trump
 is


like,
 "Okay,
 let's
 run
 into
 it.
 That's


the
 strategy.
 But
 let's
 turn
 it
 against


them
 to
 make
 them
 want
 to
 get
 it
 to
 get


out
 of
 the
 limelight.
 By
 them,
 I
 mean


the
 the
 Bill
 Clintons
 of
 the
 world."
 And


maybe
 that
 ultimately
 kills
 the
 story,


which
 is
 what
 I
 think
 he's
 looking
 for


right
 here.

This
 is
 pretty

>> [laughter]


>> It's
 pretty
 freaking
 wild.
 Again,
 this


is
 the
 the
 last
 five
 tweets
 that
 Trump


has
 done
 in
 the
 past
 24
 hours
 have
 been


about
 Epstein.
 So,
 obviously,
 it
 is
 an


issue
 that
 is
 on
 his
 mind


and
 he's
 trying
 to
 sway
 the
 public


opinion
 on
 pounder
 there
 175.


Pounder

 you

 Thank
 you

for
 being
 here.
 But
 goodness
 gracious,


what
 a
 freaking
 pivot.
 And
 the
 Okay,
 so


why
 do
 we
 think?
 Here's
 my
 question.
 Why


do
 we
 think
 the
 market
 went
 green
 on


that
 tweet?
 If
 we
 assume
 the
 market
 went


green,
 well,
 which
 the
 S&P
 5
 not


literally
 green
 yet,
 but
 very
 close
 671


on
 that
 tweet.
 Do
 we
 think
 the
 market
 is


thinking


that
 this
 puts
 an
 end
 to
 the
 Epstein


overhang
 because
 he
 just
 flipped
 it?


Or
 do
 you
 think
 I
 mean
 like
 how
 how


would
 you
 interpret
 the
 market
 liking


this
 tweet?


Unless
 this
 wasn't
 the
 reason
 for
 the


market
 going
 green.
 But
 I
 mean
 dude
 that


was
 as
 I'm
 reading
 the
 tweet
 we
 saw
 that


green
 pump
 right
 that
 green
 candle
 right


there
 from
 66960
 to
 67118.
 That
 was
 like


literally
 when
 I
 was
 reading
 out
 the


tweet.


Maybe
 it's
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 Trump,
 but


maybe
 it
 is.
 I
 don't
 know.
 Goodness,


dude.
 That
 is
 wild.


Green
 might
 be
 unrelated.


Maybe
 it
 is.

 there.

Hood
 124.


The
 fact
 that
 he's
 not
 tweeting
 about


tariffs
 or
 inflation.
 He's
 he's


concerned
 about
 this.
 Like,
 it
 is


obvious
 he's
 concerned
 about
 this.


And
 putting
 that
 out
 there
 is
 only
 just


showcasing
 how
 concerned
 he
 really
 is


starting
 to
 feel.


Um,


it's
 the
 Fed
 data
 release,
 not
 Trump.


Where's
 what
 Fed
 data?


I
 don't
 have
 any
 Fed
 data
 that
 came
 out.


If
 you're
 talking
 about
 Fed
 Talk,
 that


was
 30
 minutes
 ago
 when
 we
 talked
 about


Schmid.
 So,
 unless
 there's
 a
 piece
 of


data
 I'm
 missing,


but
 I
 don't
 see
 it
 yet.
 13F.
 We'll
 see


if
 we
 have
 anything
 else.
 Um,


okay.
 We
 have
 a
 few
 more
 13Fs
 that
 are


starting
 to
 come
 through
 right
 here.


Um,
 nothing
 crazy


that
 we're
 looking
 at.
 We
 do
 have
 a


Chris
 Han.
 He
 manages
 52
 billion.


Uh,
 sold
 off
 40%
 of
 Google,
 added
 47%
 to


Visa.
 Wow.
 Added
 some
 Moody's
 and
 SPGNI.


and
 then
 reduce
 5%
 of
 Microsoft.


A
 lot
 of
 these
 are
 pretty
 concentrated


portfolios.
 Sold
 Google
 added
 Visa.
 So


swapped
 out
 tech
 for
 financials
 here


on
 the
 13F.
 Oracle
 right
 now
 that's
 also


moving


again
 dude.
 I
 mean
 maybe
 it's
 just
 ALOS


that
 got
 this
 next
 leg
 up
 to
 officially


go
 green
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names.
 Or


maybe
 the
 market's
 reacting
 to
 the


Epstein
 stuff.

 Robin
 Hood

You
 know,
 remember
 when
 Elon
 tweeted


that
 Trump
 was
 in
 the
 Epstein
 files?


I
 mean,
 obviously
 Elon
 had
 some


information
 and
 it's
 pretty
 obvious
 that


Trump
 is
 annoyed
 and
 doesn't
 want
 this


stuff
 to
 come
 out.
 So,
 Elon
 knows


something.
 Trump
 now
 flipping
 the


script.
 I
 mean,
 this
 has
 just
 become
 a


complete
 story


that
 is
 now
 going
 to
 manifest
 itself.


And
 what
 the
 hell
 does
 Reed
 Offman
 say


to
 this?
 What
 the
 hell
 does
 Bill
 Clinton


say
 about
 this?
 I
 mean
 like


I
 mean
 you
 got
 other
 people
 Bill
 Gates
 I


mean
 Bill
 Gates's
 wife
 quite
 literally


said
 she
 left
 him
 because
 of
 the


relationship
 with
 Epstein.
 Like
 these


these
 are
 these
 are
 real
 people
 that


have
 contributed
 heavily
 to
 the


Democratic
 party
 over
 the
 past
 few
 years


that
 are
 potentially
 involved
 in
 this.


And
 if
 Trump
 goes
 this
 route


could
 really
 be
 an
 interesting
 narrative


for
 how
 the
 trajectory
 of
 this
 could


play
 out.
 But

 there

The
 funny
 thing
 is
 that
 almost
 no
 one


cared
 about
 the
 Epstein
 thing
 until
 Kosh


Patel
 made
 it
 a
 thing
 during
 the


campaign.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 why


you're
 seeing
 some


some
 of
 the
 broader
 MAGA
 base
 get


annoyed
 that
 it
 hasn't
 been
 released,


which
 is
 why
 some
 of these
 Senate


Republicans
 are
 actually
 willing
 to
 vote


on
 the
 uh
 the
 release
 of
 the
 files


because
 their
 argument
 is
 Trump
 was


campaigning.
 He
 was
 going
 to
 release
 it


and
 then
 we
 had
 to
 pivot.


So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 this


is
 this
 is
 this
 just
 took
 a
 completely


different
 turn.
 A
 completely


different
 turn.
 S&P
 500
 goes
 green,


baby.
 67250.


67250.


We
 are
 green.


Wow.
 We
 go
 green.


Trump
 tweeted
 again.
 Okay,
 this
 time
 is


about
 the
 markets.
 Cost
 and
 inflation


were
 far
 higher
 under
 the
 sleepy
 Joe


Biden
 administration
 than
 they
 are
 now.


In
 fact,
 cost
 under
 the
 Trump


administration
 are
 tumbling
 down,
 helped


greatly
 by
 gasoline
 and
 energy.


Affordability
 is
 a
 lie.
 When
 used
 by
 the


Dems,
 it
 is
 a
 complete
 conj
 job.


Thanksgiving
 costs
 are
 25%
 lower
 this


year
 than
 last.
 Under
 Crooked
 Joe,
 we


are
 the
 party
 of
 affordability.


Okay,
 first
 economic
 tweet


in
 over
 24
 hours


making
 the
 same
 argument
 that
 he
 made
 on


that
 Fox
 News
 interview
 a
 couple
 days


ago
 that
 affordability
 is
 uh
 the
 focus


and
 that
 they
 inherited


some
 higher
 costs
 from
 Joe
 Biden.


Markets
 are
 liking
 it.
 67244.

 mean,

 is


this

 of

 is

All
 right,


there's
 your
 pivot.


There's
 your
 pivot


so
 far
 for
 what
 we're
 seeing.
 Let's
 get


an
 update
 on


a
 couple
 of
 pieces
 of
 news
 including
 the


Walmart
 CEO
 retiring
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep


going
 from
 there.
 But
 we
 are
 getting
 bit


more
 of
 a
 pivot.


>> So
 he's
 run
 three
 businesses
 including


Sam
 including
 Sam's
 Club.
 I
 did
 catch
 up


with
 Ferner
 very
 recently
 October
 in
 our


CNBC
 Invest
 in
 America
 summit.
 Remember


he
 gave
 a
 pretty
 strong
 read
 on
 the
 US


consumer.


>> Customers
 are
 are
 spending
 um
 at
 a


healthy
 rate.
 Um,
 our
 back
 to
 school


started
 strong.
 So,
 we're
 seeing
 a
 a


consumer
 that
 we've
 described
 now
 for
 a


couple
 years
 is
 is
 very
 resilient.


>> Yeah.
 Already
 talking
 about
 back
 to


school
 starting
 strong.
 Um,
 Carl,
 he
 he


takes
 the
 reigns
 in
 February.
 Doug


McMillan
 will
 sort
 of
 stay
 on
 the
 board


till
 June
 and
 then
 remain
 an
 advisor.


So,
 it's
 a
 a
 sort
 of
 planned
 and
 smooth


transition.
 It's
 interesting
 because


Walmart
 is
 going
 to
 have
 a
 new
 CEO
 next


year.
 So,
 is
 Target,
 one
 of
 its
 big


rivals,
 a
 new
 CEO.
 also
 an
 insider,
 also


worked
 his
 way
 up,
 Michael
 Fidelki,
 but


coming
 from
 a
 very
 different
 position
 in


terms
 of
 strength
 competitively
 as


Target
 has
 to
 pull
 off
 a
 turnaround


story.
 Walmart
 has
 been
 riding
 high
 and


part
 of
 it
 is
 it's
 taken
 share
 uh
 from


places
 like
 Target.
 You
 can
 see
 the
 the


increase
 in
 the
 stock.
 I
 mean,
 this
 was


I
 don't
 know
 $300
 billion
 company
 when


Doug
 McMillan
 took
 over.
 Now
 more
 than


800
 billion
 company
 billion
 dollar


company
 in
 market
 cap.
 You
 know,
 I
 I'm


John
 has
 been
 someone
 who
 has
 had
 a


number
 of
 jobs
 within
 the
 store,
 but
 he


he's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 guy
 that
 takes


Walmart
 into
 the
 era
 of
 AI,
 right?
 Doug


has
 done
 part
 of
 his
 success
 has
 been


the
 pivot
 to
 e-commerce
 and


digitalization,
 what
 they've
 done
 in
 the


warehouses
 and
 the
 next
 chapter
 is
 going


to
 be
 one
 very
 much
 built
 on
 innovation


and
 technology
 as
 well
 as
 they
 as
 they


incorporate
 AI
 into
 the
 business.


>> Yeah,
 interesting
 to
 see
 a
 lot
 of


succession
 at
 consumer
 companies.
 Teemo,


Target,
 Nike,
 Starbucks,
 more
 on
 the


Walmart
 news
 at
 least.
 Let's
 bring
 in


Walmart
 analyst
 joining
 us
 this
 morning.


Uh
 Greg
 Melich
 has
 a
 buy
 rating
 on


Walmart.
 Target


>> Walmart
 still
 down
 on
 the
 day
 based
 on


some
 of
 the
 defensive
 names
 getting
 hit.


Wow,
 new
 highs.

 Robin
 Hood
 touching
 125.


Palinger
 touching
 176.


This
 is
 quite
 incredible.


[laughter]
 This
 is
 quite
 incredible,


dude.


This
 is
 why
 we
 invest.
 You
 go
 through


the
 the
 pain
 of
 looking
 at
 the


pre-markets
 to
 the
 euphoria


of
 it
 not
 being
 as
 painful
 within
 an


hour.
 Greatest
 show
 on
 earth.


Greatest
 show
 on
 earth.
 market
 by
 tweet.


I
 mean,
 this
 is
 just


it
 is
 pretty
 freaking
 crazy.
 Is
 this
 a


dead
 cat
 bounce?
 I
 mean,
 you're
 talking


about
 pound
 would
 have
 to
 go
 back
 to


what
 what
 was
 the
 lows
 today?
 162


or
 something.
 I
 mean,
 know
 Hood
 would


have
 to
 go
 down
 to
 112.
 I
 mean,
 you


would
 have
 to
 see
 a
 pretty
 ugly
 wick


down.
 I
 mean,
 you
 can
 still
 get
 a
 wick


down,
 but
 now
 given
 how
 high
 we've


gotten
 from
 the
 lows,
 it
 would
 have
 to


really
 be
 a
 nasty
 move
 down


for
 this
 to
 be
 a
 deadcat
 bounce
 and
 to


completely
 lose
 all
 of
 it,


which
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that
 easily


happens.


Oh
 my.
 Oh
 my.
 Oh
 my.
 Oh
 my.


[laughter]
 This
 is
 a
 pretty
 dead
 cat.


Not
 even
 Schroinger's
 cat
 ever
 ended
 up


this
 alive.


Oh
 my
 goodness.
 161
 on
 pounder,
 right?


Yeah.
 Again,
 like
 it's
 a
 stock
 market.


This
 is
 one
 thing
 that
 Tomley
 says
 all


the
 time,
 like
 it's
 a
 stock
 market.


These
 are
 individual
 stocks.
 When
 they


fall
 aggressively,
 you
 have
 people
 that


come
 in
 and
 say,
 "Hey,
 I
 missed
 pounder.


I
 want
 to
 get
 some
 exposure.
 I
 missed


Hood,
 but
 at
 110,
 their
 multiple
 just


went
 down
 dramatically,
 even
 though
 the


earnings
 went
 up
 dramatically,
 so
 I
 want


to
 get
 in."
 And
 so
 you
 have
 people
 that


get
 interested,
 but
 you
 also
 have
 panic


sellers
 that
 get
 out.


Um,


and
 then
 you
 have
 algos
 that
 go
 back
 and


forth.


But
 the
 number
 one
 question
 in
 the


pre-markets
 was,
 is
 this
 something


structural
 that
 is,
 you
 know,
 destroyed


the
 fabric
 of
 this
 bull
 market?
 That


does
 not
 feel
 like
 the
 case.
 Look
 at


Meta
 610.


610
 on
 Meta.


Mid,
 what's
 your
 personal
 opinion
 on


Meta
 right
 now?
 It's
 an
 overreaction.


Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 I
 I
 I
 I
 think


they're
 cheap.


Could
 I
 see
 the
 capex
 spend
 not
 being


rewarded
 in
 the
 future?
 Yes.
 It's
 just


you
 would
 have
 to
 bet
 against
 Zucks


finding
 any
 use
 case
 for
 that
 capex


right
 now.
 And
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 if
 you


want
 to
 buy
 like
 a
 hundred
 shares,
 I


don't
 think
 you
 buy
 all
 100
 right
 now.


But
 I
 definitely
 don't
 think
 you
 you
 buy


zero
 if
 you're
 if
 you
 really
 do
 want
 to


build
 a
 meta
 position.
 So
 then
 the


question
 then
 becomes
 how
 much
 do
 you


subjectively
 feel
 is
 worth
 at
 least


beginning
 to
 get
 into
 a
 position
 and
 I


think
 whatever
 that
 percentage
 is
 it
 has


to
 be
 greater
 than
 zero
 because
 you
 just


don't
 get
 massive
 massive
 opportunities


on
 max
 names
 at
 these
 multiples.


Zach
 would
 have
 to
 really
 mess
 up
 in


2026
 and
 like
 it's
 a
 $2
 trillion


company.
 Like
 they'll
 make
 mistakes,
 but


I
 don't
 know if
 they
 mess
 up
 to
 that


extent.


Um,


the
 VIX
 about
 to
 go
 red,
 is
 it?
 Let's


see.
 VIX.
 Wow.
 Yeah,
 dude.
 It
 was
 down


almost
 It
 was
 up
 20%
 today.
 Now
 it's
 up


4%.


Like
 the
 fact
 that
 you're
 seeing
 that


level
 of
 volatility
 spike
 up
 and
 down.
 I


mean
 that
 is
 your
 obvious
 on
 panic
 cell.


Do
 you
 close
 your
 cover
 calls
 early
 on


red
 days
 to
 lock
 in
 gains?
 Yes.
 Yes.
 I


actually
 closed
 a
 couple
 cover
 calls


yesterday.
 When
 you
 get
 that
 red
 the


benefit
 of
 the
 cover
 calls
 is
 that


they're
 basically
 you
 know
 up
 70
 to
 80%


especially
 when
 it
 gets
 really
 red.


That's
 when
 you
 pay
 a
 little
 money,
 get


out
 of
 those
 calls
 and,


you
 know,
 write
 a
 new
 set
 of
 ones
 if


you
 want
 to
 write
 more
 calls.
 But


obviously,
 you
 know,
 waiting
 till
 the


stock
 moves
 up
 a
 bit
 and
 then
 writing


calls
 would
 get
 you
 more
 premium.
 Google


right
 there

 BMR,


it's

 It's

Amit,
 uh,
 one
 thing
 before
 I
 leave.
 I


just
 got
 a
 package
 from
 Hims.
 Didn't


know
 my
 wife
 was
 subscribing.
 Dude,
 your


wife
 signed
 you
 up
 to
 HIMS,
 Douggee.


[laughter]


Or
 is
 she
 or
 is
 she
 a
 subscriber
 to
 the


hers
 part
 of
 it?


Bullish.


Bullish
 hymns.


Um,
 Meta,
 someone
 just
 bought
 a
 million


dollars
 of
 calls.
 620
 December
 5th


expiry.
 1.7
 million.


1.7
 million
 expiry.


Not
 me.
 She's
 on
 hers.


That's
 hilarious,
 dude.
 That's


hilarious.


That's
 so
 funny.
 Did
 you
 ever
 tell
 her


about
 him
 or
 does
 she
 just
 learn
 about


if
 she
 learned
 about
 it
 herself?
 like


the
 whole
 brand.
 That
 is
 actually
 super


bullish.
 That
 means
 an
 Instagram
 ad


probably
 caught
 her
 attention
 or


something
 and
 she
 legit
 ordered
 it


herself.


Um


yeah,
 620
 calls
 1.7
 million.


Doesn't
 620
 is
 the
 strike.


I
 didn't
 mention
 to
 her.
 You
 got
 to
 give


him
 credit.
 I
 mean,
 they
 released
 that


product
 yesterday,
 that
 199
 per
 year


subscription
 for
 their
 labs
 thing,
 but


their
 marketing
 is
 top
 tier,
 and
 that


marketing


obviously
 has
 led
 to
 a
 stronger


customer
 acquisition
 funnel.


Oracle
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 Uh,
 Ram,
 thanks


for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Have
 you
 noticed


more
 chatter
 about
 Zcash?
 I
 have.
 I
 have


no
 idea
 what
 Zcash
 is.
 I've
 heard
 about


it.
 I've
 never
 like
 actually
 looked
 into


it.
 Winkle
 Walls
 twins
 announced
 a


treasury.
 I
 would
 imagine
 I
 mean
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 are
 getting


interested
 in
 it.
 So
 you're
 probably


going
 to
 have
 some
 digital
 asset


treasuries
 around
 Zcash.
 I
 know
 that


it's
 correlated
 with
 Bitcoin


in
 a
 very
 sophisticated
 way
 if
 I'm
 not


wrong,


but
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 hell
 it
 is.


But
 it
 has
 made
 a
 good
 move
 this
 year
 as


well.
 MP,
 it's
 a
 privacy
 coin.
 You
 know,


there's
 actually
 been
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 this


whole
 privacy
 coin
 narrative
 coming
 out


there.
 I
 think
 um
 there's
 a
 couple
 VC


funds
 that
 just
 funded
 some
 companies


working
 on
 private
 blockchains.
 Like
 the


idea
 of
 like
 how
 do
 you
 have
 more


encrypted
 transactions
 on
 the
 blockchain


that
 protects
 your
 privacy?
 MP
 materials


right
 there
 that's
 up
 3.8%.


On
 the
 day
 as
 well,


it's
 the
 same
 as
 Bitcoin
 but
 adds


privacy.
 Okay,
 so
 it's
 total
 noob


question,
 but
 doesn't
 that
 take
 away
 the


point
 of
 a
 blockchain?


Like
 if
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 be


transparent,
 isn't
 the
 whole
 point
 to


have
 a
 public
 ledger?


I
 can
 understand
 why
 people
 don't
 want


it
 to
 be
 public
 obviously,


but
 the
 isn't
 the
 sort
 of
 philosophy
 of


crypto
 to
 have
 it
 public?
 Now,
 now
 if


there
 was
 sort
 of
 a
 crypto
 ecosystem


where
 it
 could
 be
 private
 and
 you
 could


get
 the
 benefits
 of
 crypto,
 but
 also
 the


benefits
 of
 privacy,
 that
 does
 seem
 very


attractive.
 But
 it
 does
 seem
 like
 it


goes
 against
 the
 actual
 like
 intrinsic


point
 of
 a
 public
 ledger
 for
 a


blockchain.


But
 again,
 I
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 much


about
 about
 Zcash.


Um
 MP59

 It

 with
 Quantum.


Dude,
 if
 quantum
 solves
 the
 cryptography


part
 of
 Bitcoin,
 that
 would
 be
 crazy.


Be
 absolutely
 crazy.


What
 else?
 What
 else?
 What
 else
 do
 we


see?
 It's
 already
 11:00
 a.m.
 So,
 we
 got


to
 11.
 Uh,
 do
 we
 have
 Hasset
 on?


We
 had
 Hasset
 on
 yesterday


at
 night.


Um,
 let's
 see
 if
 we
 have
 anything
 else


here.


Did
 you
 see
 the
 new
 Ski
 short?
 What
 is


he
 short?
 Is
 it
 another
 biotech?
 Is
 he's


out
 of
 the
 quantum
 shorts,
 right?
 I


don't
 think
 he's
 still
 in
 those.


Um


Oh,
 you
 had
 Mr.
 I
 mean,
 let's
 listen
 to


Ron
 Baron.
 He
 was
 on
 today


about
 Tessie


SoFi
 28.


We
 looked
 at
 oak
 trees
 13F
 last
 night.


We
 looked
 at
 a
 bunch
 of
 those
 last


night.
 He
 did
 buy
 more
 Grab.
 He
 bought


more
 New
 Bank
 and
 more
 Seed
 Limited
 as


well
 for
 Howard
 Marks.


All right,
 here
 is
 Ron
 Baron
 on
 Tesla.


>> 5%
 of
 your
 personal
 investments
 are
 tied


to
 Elon
 Musk
 through
 either
 SpaceX
 or


Tesla
 or
 XAI.
 It's
 about
 40
 personally


it's
 about
 40%
 in
 Tesla
 uh
 and
 about
 25%


in
 SpaceX
 and
 the
 balance
 35%
 in
 our


mutual
 funds
 and
 in
 uh
 SpaceX
 I
 think


we're
 going
 to
 make
 10
 times
 over
 the


next
 uh
 10
 years.
 Uh
 Tesla
 I
 think
 we're


going to
 make
 five
 times
 and
 my
 mutual


funds
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 make
 three


times.
 uh
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 so
 so
 it's


obviously
 riskier
 if
 you
 put
 a
 large


percentage
 of
 your
 money
 in
 one
 uh


entity
 for
 our
 mutual
 funds
 uh
 it's


about
 22%
 invested
 in
 SpaceX
 and
 Tesla


11%
 a
 piece
 and
 then
 XAI
 that's
 an


investment
 that's
 uh
 smaller
 right
 now


uh
 but
 we've
 only
 invested
 uh
 I
 guess


$350
 million
 in
 XAI
 it's
 now
 worth
 $700


million
 that
 was
 two
 or
 three
 years
 ago


and
 the
 next
 pricing
 is
 going
 to
 be


probably
 double
 where
 it
 is
 now
 means


about
 a
 three
 and
 a
 half
 so
 it's
 going


to
 be
 in
 our
 top


uh
 in
 an
 economic
 price.


>> I
 was
 thinking
 back
 to
 several
 years
 ago


when
 you
 actually
 sold
 some
 Tesla.
 You


did
 it
 at
 the
 time
 only
 because
 the


stock
 had
 increased
 so
 much
 in
 value
 to


the
 point
 where
 it
 made
 you
 a
 little


uncomfortable
 with
 how
 big
 of
 a
 position


it
 was
 in
 the
 funds.
 It
 wasn't
 a


commentary
 on
 you
 losing
 faith
 faith
 in


Elon
 Musk
 or
 in
 the
 stock,
 but
 at
 the


time
 you
 said,
 "Look,
 I
 I
 can't
 as
 a


fund
 manager
 have
 that
 big
 of
 a
 position


in
 it."
 What
 what
 has
 changed
 because
 I


think
 you
 have a
 much
 bigger
 position


today.
 Well,
 I
 didn't
 feel
 uncomfortable


uh
 but
 my
 clients
 felt
 uncomfortable
 and


I
 was
 being
 criticized
 for
 having
 such
 a


large
 investment
 in
 one
 company.
 And
 uh


we
 had
 bought
 stock
 at
 10
 or
 $15
 a


share,
 12,
 and
 uh
 it
 was
 trading
 at
 220.


And
 we
 sold
 for
 our
 clients
 about
 uh
 25%


of
 their
 investment.
 I
 want
 to
 make
 sure


that
 they
 knew
 that
 the
 reason
 they
 held


the
 stock
 was
 because
 I
 thought
 it
 was


still
 interesting
 as
 opposed
 to
 that
 I


had
 died.
 And
 so
 I
 didn't
 want
 them
 to


think
 I
 died
 and
 that's
 the
 only
 reason


they
 still
 owned
 it.
 So
 we
 sold
 a


quarter
 of
 the
 stock
 and
 then
 uh
 the


stock
 hadn't
 done
 anything
 for
 three
 or


four
 years
 and
 then
 when
 President
 Trump


uh
 was
 elected
 uh
 the
 stock
 in
 the
 first


part
 of
 this
 year
 went
 up
 dramatically


went
 up
 to
 400
 uh
 and
 we
 sold
 5%
 more.


So
 we
 sold
 30%
 for
 clients.
 I
 did
 not


sell
 personally
 a
 single
 share.
 Uh
 and


what
 I
 committed
 to
 the
 board
 of
 our


mutual
 funds
 is
 that
 I
 was
 the
 last


purchaser.
 I
 haven't
 really
 invested
 in


stock
 since
 1992
 in
 public
 companies.


And
 I
 told
 the
 board,
 if
 you
 let
 me


invest
 in
 this,
 when
 I
 tried
 to
 get


everyone
 else
 to
 invest,
 nobody
 else


wanted
 to
 at
 Baron
 Capital.
 So
 I
 said,


if
 you
 let
 me
 invest
 uh
 uh
 certain


amount
 of
 money,
 uh
 then
 what
 I
 will
 do


is
 I
 will
 promise
 that
 I
 won't
 sell
 any


of
 my
 stock.
 And
 I
 told
 you
 I
 wouldn't


invest,
 but
 let
 me
 break
 my
 promise
 and


uh
 let
 me
 invest
 and
 then
 uh
 I
 will
 be


the
 last
 person
 out
 uh
 of
 the
 stock.
 So


I
 will
 not
 sell
 a
 single
 share
 of
 my


company
 of
 my
 shares
 until
 my
 clients


can
 sell
 a
 100%
 of
 their
 shares.
 And
 I


don't
 expect
 to
 sell
 in
 my
 lifetime


Tesla
 or
 SpaceX.
 Either
 one.


>> Wow.
 Um,


>> all
 right.
 So,
 Ron
 Baron
 not
 saying


anything
 that
 he
 hasn't
 said
 before,
 but


he
 has
 been
 pretty
 optimistic
 on
 Tesla


for
 a
 long
 time.
 And
 he
 did
 make
 that


promise
 to
 his
 board
 years
 ago
 that
 he


would
 be
 the
 last
 one
 out
 whenever
 it
 is


time
 to
 sell.
 Uh,
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 has


not
 invested
 in
 public
 companies
 in
 over


30
 years,
 but
 Tesla
 is
 the
 number
 one


sort
 of
 correlation
 in
 his
 funds


is
 pretty
 incredible.
 I
 mean,
 it
 goes
 to


show
 how
 much
 faith
 and
 how
 much
 trust


and
 respect
 he
 has
 for
 for
 Elon
 Musk.


They
 have
 a
 big
 stake
 in
 SpaceX
 as
 well.


So,
 look,
 obviously
 Tesla
 has
 continued


to
 get
 a
 premium
 and
 earnings
 growth


will
 have
 to
 come
 back,
 but
 Baron


Capital
 continues
 to
 be
 bullish
 on
 them.


40355,
 that's
 up
 half
 a
 percent
 right


there
 on
 the
 day.
 S&P
 slightly
 going


red.
 AMD
 as
 well
 slightly
 going
 red.
 Got


some
 red
 candles
 across
 the
 board.
 I


think
 even
 if
 we
 end
 lower
 than
 where
 we


are
 today,
 even
 if
 we
 end
 red
 on
 the


S&P,


I
 would
 be
 happy
 that
 it's
 not
 at
 the


worst
 of
 what
 we
 saw
 in
 the
 pre-market.


Today's
 goal
 was
 to
 stop
 the
 bleeding.


Anything
 else
 is
 a
 cherry
 on
 top,


but
 it
 would
 be
 nice
 to
 just
 stop
 the


bleeding.
 [clears throat]


That
 would
 be
 the
 most
 mortant.
 Uh
 Matt


says,
 "Found
 you
 this
 week.
 Appreciate


the
 content,
 Matt.
 Thanks
 for
 being


here.
 Appreciate
 you
 being
 part
 of
 the


show.
 We
 are
 here
 every
 morning
 and


afternoon.
 Uh
 today
 afternoon,
 by
 the


way,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 that
 startup


that
 I
 told
 you
 guys
 about
 a
 week
 ago


that
 I
 invested
 in.
 They're
 going to


come
 on
 to
 the
 show
 and
 kind
 of
 show
 us


what
 they're
 working
 out
 on.
 It
 is
 in
 a


is
 in
 the
 crypto
 finance
 space.
 They


raised
 $15
 million
 from
 Benchmark,
 which


is
 like
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 VC
 funds
 in


Silicon
 Valley.
 They
 invested
 in
 Uber,


Snapchat
 very
 early.
 So,
 they'll
 hop
 on


the
 show
 in
 the
 market
 close
 and
 give
 us


kind
 of
 a
 takeaway
 of
 what
 they're


doing.
 By
 the
 way,
 speaking
 of
 crypto


startups,
 I
 did
 see
 something
 last
 night


that
 I
 want
 to
 show
 you
 guys
 that
 I


don't
 think
 should
 really
 exist
 as
 a


product.
 Nonetheless,
 it
 is
 real.


Um,
 I
 think
 it
 is
 incredibly
 dangerous,


but
 this
 is
 another
 company
 that
 uh


raised
 $7.5
 million
 in
 the
 finance


world.


So,
 let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 pull
 up
 this


clip


because
 it
 did
 go
 viral
 last
 night.


Okay,
 so
 here
 it
 is.
 I'm
 very
 curious
 to


see
 what
 your
 reactions
 will
 be,
 but


these
 guys
 have
 gified
 perpetual
 options


future
 trading
 and
 this
 is
 how
 they


gamified
 it.
 So,
 this
 is
 the
 video.


As
 you
 can
 see,
 you
 can
 literally
 click


on
 different
 targets


and
 if
 the
 price
 of
 the
 coin
 or
 whatever


futures
 contract
 you're
 trading


gets
 to
 that
 target,


you
 will
 win.


So
 instead
 of
 like
 going
 2x
 long
 at


37.40
 on
 Ethereum
 and
 then
 as
 soon
 as
 it


gets
 there
 you
 like,
 you
 know,
 you
 make


your
 2x
 long,
 you
 you
 you
 touch
 on


certain
 squares
 and
 those
 squares
 light


up
 showing
 the
 amount
 of
 leverage
 you


can
 take
 and
 the
 amount
 of
 money
 you
 can


win.
 And
 then
 the
 the
 the
 the the
 thing


going
 up
 and
 down
 is
 the
 is
 the
 price
 of


the
 asset
 or
 of
 the
 of
 the
 derivative
 of


the
 asset
 that
 you're
 trading.


And
 if
 it
 goes
 in
 a
 certain
 direction,


then
 you
 win
 or
 lose
 money.


I'm
 all
 for
 democratizing
 finance.
 I


This
 [ __ ]
 is
 different.
 This
 [ __ ]
 is
 now


look
 is
 it
 an
 innovative
 idea
 to
 get


more
 um
 simplicity
 to
 the
 to
 the


perpetual
 futures
 world
 which
 is
 a


massive
 massive
 massive
 market
 and
 you


know
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 are
 thinking


about
 their
 strategy
 to
 get
 into
 it.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 that
 these


brokerages
 can
 make.
 Even
 Robin
 is


getting
 into
 perpetual
 futures.
 Yes.
 But


to
 gify
 it
 like
 that


almost
 legitimately
 makes
 it
 a
 casino.


Now,
 a
 grant
 again
 I
 you
 know
 there


there's
 already
 a
 lot
 of these
 casinos


that
 exist
 like
 stake.
 That's
 a
 crypto


one
 based
 in
 Australia.
 I
 mean
 they've


gified
 crypto
 trading
 literally
 through


blackjack
 and
 all
 these
 other
 different


like
 like
 like
 um
 sort
 of
 similar
 games


where
 the
 thing
 goes
 up,
 it
 goes
 down,


you
 win
 a
 certain
 amount
 of
 money
 if
 it


lands
 in
 a
 certain
 area.
 just
 like
 a
 UI


on
 top
 of
 like
 the
 price
 action
 to


determine
 how
 much
 money
 you
 get,
 if


you're
 right
 or
 wrong,
 or
 if
 you're
 long


or
 short.
 So,
 it's
 not
 like
 this
 hasn't


been
 done
 before,
 but
 that's
 been


strictly
 rooted
 in
 a
 certain
 type
 of


niche
 of
 I
 wouldn't
 even
 call
 them


investors,
 just
 pure
 traders.


This
 thing,
 if
 it
 were
 to
 go
 mainstream,


I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 that


would
 look
 like.
 That
 would
 be
 a
 I
 mean,


imagine
 that
 thing
 that
 I
 just
 showed


you
 became
 as
 mainstream
 as
 prediction


markets.


It's
 pretty
 easy
 to
 say,
 "Hey,
 I
 think


the
 Lakers
 are
 going
 to
 win.
 I'm
 going


to
 bet
 50
 cents
 on
 this
 Lakers
 contract


and
 that's
 why
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of


adoption
 on
 the
 prediction
 markets.
 If


you
 had
 something
 like
 that
 for


perpetual
 futures
 that
 went
 truly
 viral,


I
 mean,
 that
 would
 be
 pretty
 crazy."


So
 now,
 when
 I
 show
 videos
 like
 that,


you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 saying,
 "Well,


that's
 the
 top."
 [laughter]
 Which
 I


understand,
 I
 get.


The
 question
 simply
 becomes,
 you
 know,


how
 much
 momentum
 do
 products
 like
 that


get?
 And
 again,
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 why


Bitcoin
 got
 got
 hit
 this
 morning
 is


because
 one
 could
 argue
 there's
 so
 much


leverage
 in
 the
 system,
 not
 exactly


because
 of
 that
 product,
 but
 because
 of


uh
 the
 the
 risk
 appetite
 that
 that


product
 is
 obviously
 uh
 leaning
 towards.


And
 that
 level
 of
 risk
 appetite,
 it
 got


chopped
 off
 today
 as
 Bitcoin
 is
 well


below
 100,000.


Is
 that
 bearish
 or
 bullish?
 I
 mean,
 long


term,
 that's
 probably
 bullish.
 You
 get


that
 leverage
 out
 of
 the
 system,
 it's


easier
 for
 these
 assets
 to
 just
 have


more
 room
 to
 move
 on
 and
 keep
 running.


So,
 I
 don't
 think
 that's
 too
 crazy,
 but


that's
 what
 you
 got
 going
 on
 right


there.
 Netflix
 is
 down
 because
 they
 are


potentially
 acquiring
 Warner
 Brothers.


There's
 a
 couple
 reports
 that
 that
 is


going
 to
 lead
 to
 antitrust
 concerns,
 and


that's
 why
 you're
 seeing
 Netflix
 take
 a


3%
 hit
 right
 here.
 Uh,
 we
 got
 Dan
 Niles


on
 CNBC.


Let's
 see
 how
 he's
 thinking.
 We
 had
 Dan


Ies
 who
 was
 more
 bullish.


This
 is
 Mr.
 Dan
 Niles
 and
 his
 take
 on


the
 markets.


you
 know,
 is
 called
 into
 question.
 And


so
 that's
 the
 biggest
 problem
 because


this
 gets
 us
 to
 point
 number
 two,
 which


is
 the
 other
 big
 driver
 is
 obviously
 AI,


but
 within
 that
 there's
 some
 companies


that
 need
 to
 raise
 a
 lot
 of
 debt
 today


to
 fund
 revenues
 they
 hope
 will
 show
 up


in
 the
 future.
 And
 so
 if
 you've
 got
 that


easy
 money
 going
 away,
 that
 calls
 a
 lot


of
 that
 into
 question.
 And
 having


companies
 like
 OpenAI
 saying,
 hey,


talking
 about
 a
 backs
 stop
 from
 the


government,
 that
 makes
 people
 then


finally
 go,
 well,
 can
 a
 company
 that's


going
 to
 exit
 the
 year
 at
 20
 billion
 in


revenue
 run
 rate


fund
 1.4
 trillion
 in
 commitments
 that


they
 have
 out
 there?
 The
 answer
 is
 in
 my


mind
 is
 obviously
 no.
 But
 it
 makes
 you


think
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 about
 can
 all
 of


these
 companies
 win
 in
 AI?
 And
 history


has
 shown
 that
 that's
 just
 not
 the
 way


it
 works,
 right?
 In
 e-commerce,
 you've


got
 one
 guy,
 Amazon.
 And
 in
 search,
 you


got
 one
 guy,
 that's
 Google.
 In


streaming,
 you've
 got
 one
 guy,
 that's


Netflix.
 And
 so,
 I
 think
 to
 think
 all
 of


these
 guys
 are
 going
 to
 con
 win


just
 doesn't
 fit
 with
 what's
 happened


with
 tech
 in
 the
 past,
 which
 then
 makes


you
 go
 who's
 exposed
 to
 whom
 and
 who's


the
 best
 position
 when
 you
 come
 out.


>> Right.
 Dan,
 you
 used
 to
 cover
 chips.
 I


remember
 it
 was
 a
 little
 while
 ago,
 but


it
 did
 happen.
 You
 know,
 well,
 sort
 of


the
 the
 accounting
 uh
 the
 lifespan


accounting
 of
 these
 tools,
 these


products.
 Uh
 part
 of
 the
 skeptics's


argument
 now
 is
 that
 the
 depreciation


schedules
 don't
 make
 sense.
 Technology


will
 improve,
 you
 depreciation,
 you're


essentially
 overstating
 earnings.
 Is


that
 a
 is
 that
 a
 material
 discussion


right
 now
 or
 not?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 absolutely
 material.
 And
 I've


commented
 on
 this
 in
 the
 past.
 If
 you


look
 at
 the
 big
 hyperscalers,


they've
 all
 been
 extending
 over
 the
 last


several
 years
 the
 depreciation
 life.
 Now


ask
 yourself,
 does
 that
 make
 any
 sense


to
 you?
 Because
 during
 the
 last
 few


years,
 right,
 I
 think
 we've
 all
 heard
 of


this
 thing
 called
 AI,
 right?
 Jensen
 at


NVIDIA,
 the
 CEO
 of
 Nvidia,
 has
 come
 out


and
 said,
 "We're
 going
 to
 introduce
 a


new
 chip
 every
 year,
 which
 will
 make
 the


old
 chip
 somewhat
 obsolete."
 So
 we
 heard


about
 chat
 GPT
 at
 the
 end
 of
 2022
 and
 so


to
 me
 to
 have
 companies
 extending
 their


depreciation
 lives
 at
 the
 same
 time


you've
 got
 the
 pace
 of
 introductions
 for


these
 chips
 coming
 down
 to
 one
 year
 that


obviously
 doesn't
 make
 sense
 and
 to


Amazon's
 credit
 they
 actually


>> there
 is
 a
 retort
 to
 this
 that
 we'll


talk
 about
 in
 a
 second
 around
 this
 whole


depreciation
 argument


>> took
 it
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 a
 couple
 of


quarters
 ago
 and
 so
 this
 is
 again


something
 that
 brings
 me
 to
 the
 whole


point
 of
 you
 got
 to
 start


differentiating
 between
 the
 different


companies
 because
 there's
 a
 big


difference
 between
 an
 Amazon
 and
 a


Google
 that
 can
 fund
 all
 of
 this


internally
 with
 cash
 flow
 and
 have
 money


left
 over
 versus
 others
 that
 may
 need
 to


go
 hit
 the
 debt
 markets
 to
 fund
 you
 know


their
 infrastructure
 buildouts
 but
 they


got
 to
 hope
 that
 open
 AI
 comes
 up
 with


1.4
 trillion
 over
 the
 next
 several
 years


to
 get
 there.
 So,
 so
 who
 can
 you
 just


name
 name?
 Who
 are
 you
 worried
 about?


>> Well,
 I
 mean
 I
 think


[laughter]


what
 I
 would
 say
 is
 let
 me
 focus
 on
 the


let
 me
 focus
 on
 the
 ones
 I'm
 not
 worried


about.
 I
 think
 anthropic,
 right?
 Unlike


OpenAI
 which
 has
 got
 obviously
 they're


they've
 projected
 losses
 all
 the
 way


through
 2029.
 Anthropic
 isn't


anticipating
 to
 turn
 profitable
 in
 2026,


so
 next
 year.
 and
 their
 revenues
 are


expected
 to
 go
 from
 1
 billion
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 this
 last
 year
 exiting
 the


year
 at
 9
 billion
 revenues
 doubling
 next


year.
 So
 if
 you
 look
 at
 that
 and
 you


say,
 "Hey,
 Amazon
 hosts
 them,
 Google


hosts
 them,
 they
 should
 be
 in
 good


shape."
 You
 know,
 I
 look
 at
 Microsoft


and
 I
 go,
 they've
 obviously
 got
 a
 big


relationship.
 I'm
 not
 as
 worried
 about


them
 because
 I
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 be


one
 of
 the
 big
 winners
 because
 in


corporate
 AI
 they
 and
 Oracle
 have
 the


best,
 you
 know,
 products
 in
 the
 sense


that
 everybody's
 got
 Microsoft
 Office


and
 60%
 of
 the
 world's
 databases
 are


Oracle.
 But
 you
 look
 at
 Oracle
 and
 how


much
 they
 have
 to
 borrow.
 Clearly,


that's
 been
 at
 the
 epicenter
 of
 all
 of


this
 where
 when
 Oracle
 reported
 on


September
 9th,
 the
 stock
 went
 up
 36%.


Right.
 next
 day.
 The
 stock
 is
 now
 about


10%
 lower.
 I
 know
 it's
 moving


[clears throat]
 around
 than
 where
 it
 was


when
 they
 announced
 that
 monster
 quarter


with
 455


billion
 in
 RPO
 with
 Open
 AI
 at
 300


billion
 of
 that.
 But
 does
 it
 make
 sense


that
 that
 stock
 is
 10%
 lower
 than
 when


they
 announced
 that
 big
 deal
 while


semiconductors,
 which
 by
 the
 way,


they're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 get
 bought,


right?
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 fund
 all
 of


this,
 those
 the
 semiconductor
 index
 is


15%
 higher
 than
 where
 it
 was
 on


September
 9th.
 So,
 I
 think
 there's
 going


to
 be
 some
 more,
 you
 know,
 uniformity


where
 people
 go,
 well,
 if
 Oracle
 can't


pay
 for
 this,
 then
 clearly
 the


semiconductor
 stocks
 are
 too
 high
 or


Oracle's
 a
 screaming
 buy
 given
 it's


lower
 by
 10%
 than
 where
 it
 was
 on


September
 9th.
 So,
 I
 think
 there's
 going


to
 be
 a
 long


>> I
 think
 that's
 a
 fair
 point.
 And
 then


obviously
 that
 begs
 the
 question
 on
 like


what
 is
 Oracle's
 growth
 trajectory
 um
 in


relationship
 to
 the
 stock
 price
 decline


from
 that
 earnings
 report.
 But
 that
 is


something
 that
 investors
 have
 to
 figure


out.
 The
 $40
 billion
 debt
 is
 probably


why
 it's
 trading
 at
 10%
 lower
 given
 AMD


and
 Nvidia
 aren't
 taking
 that
 type
 of


debt.
 Here
 is
 uh
 what
 ticker
 symbol
 you


said
 yesterday
 about
 depreciation.
 I'm


going
 to
 link
 his
 video
 right
 here.


again,
 good
 friend
 of
 the
 channel,
 but


he
 had
 a
 take
 on
 depreciation
 that
 I


thought
 made
 some
 sense
 and
 is
 why
 the


hyperscalers
 are
 not
 uh
 showing
 the
 type


of
 depreciation
 that
 someone
 like


Michael
 Bur
 says
 they
 have
 to
 show
 and


kind
 of
 accusing
 them
 of
 accounting


fraud.


>> Appreciation
 of
 their
 assets
 by
 saying


that
 AI
 chips
 will
 have
 longer
 useful


lifespans
 so
 that
 they
 can
 spread
 their


depreciation
 costs
 out
 over
 longer


periods
 of
 time
 to
 boost
 their
 earnings.


By
 his
 estimates,
 this
 accounting
 tactic


would
 understate
 depreciation
 costs
 by


about
 $176
 billion
 across
 the
 industry.


And
 companies
 like
 Meta
 Platforms
 and


Oracle
 could
 be
 overstating
 their


profits
 by
 21
 to
 27%
 respectively.
 Look,


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 sit
 here
 and
 pretend


that
 I'm
 smarter
 than
 Michael
 Bur,
 but


if
 you've
 been
 watching
 this
 channel
 for


a
 while,
 you
 might
 remember
 when
 I


covered
 something
 called
 Tensor
 RT
 LLM.


Don't
 worry,
 I'll
 break
 it
 down
 for
 you.


Back
 in
 2023,
 Nvidia
 came
 out
 with
 an


open-source
 software
 package
 called


Tensor
 RT
 LLM,
 which
 literally
 doubled


the
 inference
 performance
 for
 large


language
 models
 running
 on
 Nvidia's


GPUs.
 That
 meant
 the
 hundreds
 of


thousands
 of
 Hopper
 H100
 GPUs
 bought
 by


these
 same
 exact
 companies,
 Amazon,


Microsoft,
 Google,
 and
 Meta
 Platforms


got
 twice
 as
 good
 at
 running
 large


language
 models
 overnight
 thanks
 to
 this


software
 update.
 But
 Nvidia's
 hardware


and
 software
 ecosystems
 are
 designed
 to


be
 backward
 compatible.
 So
 the
 same


software
 package
 also
 works
 on
 the


Ampure
 A100's
 which
 predate
 the
 H100s


and
 it
 also
 works
 on
 their
 current


generation
 of
 Blackwell
 GPUs.
 In
 my


opinion,
 this
 is
 a
 clear
 example
 of


older
 chips
 having
 their
 useful
 lifespan


extended
 by
 a
 software
 update,
 which


means
 they
 can
 reasonably
 be
 depreciated


over
 longer
 periods
 of
 time.
 For


example,
 if
 we're
 following
 Moore's
 law,


which
 says
 that
 computer
 chips
 get


roughly
 two
 times
 better
 every
 2
 years


and
 tensor
 RTLM
 just
 made
 the
 H100's


twice
 as
 good
 at
 inference,
 then
 that


should
 extend
 their
 useful
 lifespan
 by
 2


years
 for
 depreciation
 purposes.
 And
 of


course,
 Nvidia
 has
 many
 more
 software


packages
 that
 focus
 on
 improving
 the
 AI


performance
 of
 their
 chips.


>> So
 again,
 it
 might
 not
 be
 the
 most


perfect
 argument
 again
 uh
 or
 against
 the


argument
 around
 depreciation
 from
 a


accounting
 perspective,
 but
 the
 simple


kind
 of
 core
 basic
 argument
 is
 that
 if


the
 chips
 get
 better
 based
 on
 the


software
 updates
 from
 Nvidia,
 and


there's
 historical
 evidence
 that
 that's


the
 case.
 By
 the
 way,
 S&P
 new
 highs
 of


the
 day,
 67,280.


Then
 that
 means
 the
 life
 cycle
 of
 using


the
 chips
 should
 extend,
 which
 means
 so


should
 the
 depreciation
 cycle.
 Um,
 which


also
 means
 like
 the
 accounting
 fraud


that
 Michael
 Bur
 says
 is
 overestimating


earnings.
 It
 just
 might
 be
 completely


inaccurate
 if
 that's
 the
 case.
 So,
 I


think
 there
 is
 an
 argument
 against


appreciation
 if
 people
 want
 to
 get
 super


hung
 up
 on
 that.

 It
 did.
 It
 hit


18950.


Trying
 to
 push
 for
 190
 here


as
 it
 goes
 green.
 Coreweave.


Core
 weave
 officially
 green.
 It
 was
 down


five.
 Nebius,
 are
 we
 red?
 We
 are
 still


down
 about
 2%.


On
 Nebius.


Wow.
 AMD
 250.
 AMD
 was
 234


in
 the
 pre-markets.


Okay.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 and
 and
 going
 to


Dan
 Nile's
 point
 around
 capex
 spend.
 I


mean,
 it's
 the
 same
 argument,
 right?


Like
 either
 you
 believe
 OpenAI
 is
 going


to
 come
 up
 with
 the
 money
 or
 you
 don't.


And
 if
 you
 don't
 then
 you
 you
 position


appropriately.
 If
 you
 do
 because
 you


think
 they
 are
 a
 critical
 infrastructure


in
 this
 AI
 ecosystem
 and
 that
 there
 will


be
 an
 ROI
 then
 you
 know
 that's
 why
 you


stay
 long
 and
 even
 if
 they
 don't
 this
 is


kind
 of the
 conversation
 we
 were
 having


last
 night
 if
 OpenAI
 really
 does
 fail


it's
 definitely
 going
 to
 hurt
 a
 lot
 of


the
 chip
 plays
 but
 the
 Mac
 7
 are
 going


to
 survive
 because
 the
 Mac
 7
 have
 very


large
 moes
 and
 business
 models.
 So
 like


will
 that
 take
 down
 the
 market
 if
 the


chip
 plays
 get
 hit?
 Yes.
 Will
 the


sentiment
 be
 bad
 if
 you
 know
 OpenAI


fails
 or
 something?
 Yes.


Does
 that
 completely
 delegitimize


everything
 Google's
 done
 with
 Gemini?


No.


Definitely
 doesn't
 hurt
 what
 Anthropic's


done
 with
 cloud.
 I
 mean,
 or
 with
 Cloud.


I
 mean,
 so
 OpenAI
 is
 a
 lynch
 pin,
 but
 I


don't
 know if
 it
 is
 the
 single
 lynch
 pin


to
 the
 entirety
 of
 the
 stock
 market.


And
 again,
 this
 is
 assuming
 they
 fail.
 I


mean,
 I
 don't
 think
 OpenAI
 is
 going to


fail.
 Maybe
 they
 don't
 spend
 a
 trillion


on
 capex,
 but
 they
 probably
 don't
 fail.


Speaking
 of
 OpenAI,
 this
 is
 what
 Chat


GBT
 launched
 yesterday
 in
 terms
 of
 new


products.
 Group
 chats
 in
 chat
 are
 now


piloting
 in
 Japan,
 New
 Zealand,
 and


South
 Korea,
 and
 Taiwan
 a
 new
 way
 to


collaborate
 with
 friends,
 family,
 or


co-workers
 and
 chatt.


They're
 literally
 replacing
 iMessage
 and


Facebook
 Messenger
 and
 WhatsApp
 at
 the


same
 time.
 Now,
 will
 they
 be
 successful


at
 this?
 I
 don't
 know.
 But
 you
 can


obviously
 see
 what
 they're
 trying
 to
 do.


They
 are
 trying
 to
 go
 after
 everything


from
 an
 AI
 perspective.


And
 so
 if
 you
 have
 group
 chats
 with
 chat


GBT
 as
 the
 the
 foundation
 of
 it
 with


your
 friends
 as
 a
 fully
 integrated


ecosystem
 which
 I
 don't know
 why
 Apple


couldn't
 easily
 replace
 this
 with


iMessage
 and
 Gemini
 like
 feel
 like


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 ways
 you
 can


navigate
 but
 like
 the
 fact
 that
 they're


trying
 to
 do
 this
 to
 strengthen
 the
 moat


of
 how
 many
 times
 people
 will
 be
 using


their
 LLM.


I
 mean
 goes
 to
 show
 more
 and
 more


products
 that
 are
 trying
 to
 come
 out.


Now,
 I
 don't
 know if
 I
 would
 really
 be


in
 a
 group
 chat
 with
 my
 friends
 on


ChatBT,
 but


nonetheless,
 these
 are
 different
 ideas


that
 they're
 going
 for.
 249
 right
 here


on
 AMD.


I
 think
 this
 is
 useless.
 What
 is
 the


value?
 I
 don't
 know.
 Again,
 like
 I
 I


haven't
 really
 experienced
 a
 product


with
 an
 AI
 message
 native
 platform,
 but


they're
 trying
 stuff,
 right?
 And
 I
 think


there's
 going to
 be
 a
 lot
 of


experimentation
 over
 the
 coming
 years


and
 some
 will
 work,
 some
 will
 not.


But
 whatever
 the
 stuff
 that
 does
 work,


you're
 going
 to
 need
 a
 lot
 more
 compute


to
 be
 able
 to
 make
 sense
 of
 it.
 Wow.
 S&P


673.


She's
 really
 trying
 to
 hold
 the
 670s,


not
 just
 teeter
 above
 it.


Group
 chats
 with
 your
 AI
 friends.


When
 is
 opening
 eye
 going
 public?
 I


would
 say
 latest
 2028.


I
 think
 2027
 there's
 actually
 a
 good


shot.
 But
 I
 think
 probably
 when
 they


cross
 100
 billion
 in
 revenue,
 they'd


feel
 comfortable
 going
 public
 because


they
 probably
 go
 public
 at
 a
 trillion.


So
 10
 times
 revenue
 I
 think
 is
 what


they're
 aiming
 for,
 which
 might
 take
 two


years
 to
 get
 there.
 Nvidia,
 are
 we


trying
 to
 push
 190?


Wow.
 18934.


Fullon
 Vshape
 on
 the
 day


for
 now.
 Middle
 of
 the
 day,
 but
 bulls


stepped
 in.


Bull
 stepped
 in
 as
 we
 go
 green.


It's
 pretty
 freaking
 incredible.
 Let's


finish
 it
 off
 with
 Dan
 Ies
 or
 Dan
 Niles


and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


More
 uniformity
 coming
 out
 of
 this


versus
 right
 now
 where
 you
 know
 you've


got
 these
 big
 moves
 that
 don't
 make


sense
 if
 soft
 if
 this
 company
 doesn't


work
 well
 but
 semuse
 will
 be
 fine.


>> Right.
 All right.
 So,
 it
 sounds
 like


you're
 worried
 more
 about
 valuations
 in


the
 in
 the
 chips
 names
 and
 maybe
 the


private
 open
 AI
 um
 because
 you
 drew
 a


line
 and
 and
 called
 out
 anthropic
 for


profitability.
 We
 don't
 really
 know
 when


that's
 going
 to
 happen
 for
 Open
 AI.


>> Well,
 no,
 we
 do.
 They've
 told
 us,
 right,


that
 they're
 going
 to
 lose
 money
 through


2029
 and
 they're
 only
 going
 to
 get


profitable
 fiscal
 30.
 That's
 a
 lifetime


from
 now
 for
 sure.


>> That's
 what
 I
 mean.
 That's
 what
 I
 mean.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 every
 company


that's
 exposed
 to
 them,
 you
 got
 to
 sit


there
 and
 question
 that
 a
 little
 bit


more
 because
 I
 personally
 believe
 that


Google's
 going
 to
 kill
 them
 in
 consumer.


Why?
 Because
 Google
 got
 is
 a
 cash
 flow


machine
 with
 more
 data
 than
 anyone
 in


the
 world
 because
 of
 YouTube
 to
 train


their
 models.
 They're
 going
 to
 win
 in


consumer.
 So
 that
 cuts
 that
 market
 off


for
 Open
 AI,
 which
 by
 the
 way,
 if
 you


remember,
 like
 I
 always
 focus
 on
 what


companies
 do,
 not
 what
 they
 say.
 And
 in


August,
 OpenAI
 was
 saying,
 "Oh,
 you


know,
 we're
 glad
 and
 we're
 proud
 that
 we


don't
 have
 to
 have
 any
 erotica
 on
 the


platform,
 taking
 a
 shot
 at,
 you
 know,


um,
 XAI."


Then
 they
 come
 out
 two
 months
 later
 and


they
 say,
 "Well,
 we're
 going
 to
 allow


erotica
 on
 the
 platform
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 year."
 That
 speaks
 to
 the
 problems


and
 they
 know
 that
 that's
 not
 going
 to


be
 liked
 by
 a
 lot
 of
 investors.
 It's


going
 to
 make
 going
 public
 that
 much


harder.
 But
 so
 why
 are
 they
 doing
 that?


Because
 they're
 having
 trouble


monetizing
 on
 the
 consumer
 side.
 So
 I


think
 as
 I
 said
 earlier,
 you've
 ended
 up


with
 one
 or
 two
 winners
 at
 most
 in
 the


internet
 era
 and
 different
 verticals.


And
 I
 think
 when
 I
 look
 at
 consumer


Google
 and
 then
 you
 know
 Tik
 Tok
 and


China,
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 the
 big


winners
 because
 of
 all
 that
 data
 they


have
 to
 train
 on.
 I
 think
 Microsoft
 and


Oracle
 because
 of
 their
 dominant


positions
 in
 corporate,
 they
 should
 end


up
 being
 the
 winners
 there.
 And
 then


it's
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 tougher.
 And


that's
 already
 three
 guys.
 It's
 going
 to


get
 a
 lot
 tougher
 for
 everyone
 else,
 I


think,
 because
 at
 some
 point
 you
 may


have
 these
 fantastical
 forecast.
 And
 I'm


sure
 we
 all
 remember
 those
 in
 2000,


but
 you
 got
 to
 show
 you
 can
 generate


money
 from
 all
 of
 this.
 And
 I
 think


that's
 where
 it
 gets
 trickier
 when
 five


billion
 consumers
 are
 used
 to
 going
 on


to
 putting
 something
 into
 their
 search


bar
 and
 getting
 an
 answer
 for
 free.


>> Right.
 Right.
 Finally,
 Dan,
 um
 the


rotation
 XLV
 14%
 in
 3
 months.
 I
 mean,


just
 some
 of
 these
 movements
 of
 tech


money
 into
 Saudi
 Arabia's
 public


investment
 fund
 sells
 all
 of
 their


Nvidia,
 all
 of
 their
 UNH,
 all
 of
 their


Micardo
 Libre,


all
 of
 their
 Nvidia,
 all
 of
 their
 Melly,


and
 all
 of
 their
 UNH.
 They
 didn't
 buy


anything
 new.
 Um,
 but
 those
 were
 the


three
 cells
 that
 they
 had.


>> Old
 economy
 names
 make
 sense.


I
 mean,
 it
 makes
 sense
 in
 the
 following


way.
 I
 mean,
 I've
 I've
 been
 talking


about
 for
 a
 while
 that
 valuations
 are


obviously
 extremely
 high,
 but
 valuations


really
 don't
 matter
 until
 they
 do.
 And


that's
 kind
 of
 what
 concerns
 me.
 The
 Fed


is
 actually
 going
 to,
 you
 know,
 whether


they
 cut
 or
 not,
 they're
 going
 on
 pause


for
 the
 next
 one,
 right?
 So
 I
 think
 we


all
 can
 probably
 agree
 on
 that
 based
 on,


you
 know,
 up
 to
 four
 or
 five
 people
 that


look
 like
 they
 could
 potentially
 not


vote
 for
 a
 cut
 or
 descent
 if
 there
 is
 a


cut.
 And
 so
 then
 you
 look
 at
 the
 sectors


that
 are
 sort
 of
 more
 defensive
 and
 you


go,
 yeah,
 consumer
 staples,
 the
 SNAP


benefits
 are
 coming
 back
 with
 the


government
 reopened.


>> That
 should
 really
 help
 sectors
 like


that.
 You
 know,
 health
 care,
 which
 had


gotten
 beaten
 up
 obviously
 earlier,


that's
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 defensive.
 So


some
 of
 the
 less
 speculative
 areas
 of


the
 market
 like
 nobody's
 not
 buying


toothpaste
 and
 nobody's
 not


>> which
 explains
 the
 rotation
 to


defensives.
 I
 mean
 and
 that's
 what
 we've


seen
 happen
 throughout
 the
 entire
 week.


Nvidia
 190


S&P
 674.


Wow.


3%
 up
 on
 the
 day
 for
 the
 S&P.
 This
 thing


was
 at
 663


an
 hour
 and
 a
 half
 ago.
 Complete
 pivot.


Complete
 pivot.
 Nvidia
 190,
 Hoodie
 125,


Palunteer
 176.


This
 market
 time
 and
 time
 again
 has
 said


that
 we
 are
 not
 easily
 going
 down


without
 a
 fight.


And
 when
 stocks
 get
 cheap
 enough


relative
 to
 their
 earnings,
 which
 many


of
 these
 names
 did
 in
 the
 pre-market,


including
 in
 Nvidia,
 one
 could
 argue


this
 was
 one
 of
 the
 cheapest
 names.
 When


you
 look
 at
 other
 names
 compared
 to


their
 earnings,
 I
 mean,
 did
 buyers
 step


in,


dude.
 [laughter]


[gasps]


All right.
 Now,
 everyone
 can
 have
 a
 good


lunch.
 Now,
 everyone
 can
 or
 if
 you're
 uh


if
 you're
 about
 to
 go
 to
 sleep,
 you
 can


have
 who's
 about
 to
 go
 to
 sleep
 in
 like


the
 next
 hour.


Who
 All right,
 put
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you're


about
 to
 go
 to
 sleep,
 if
 you're
 about
 to


get
 lunch,
 or
 if
 you're
 about
 to
 eat


breakfast.
 You
 can
 have
 a
 bit
 more
 of
 a


relaxing


at
 least
 next
 hour
 before
 we
 get


whipsawed
 back
 down
 if
 that
 happens.


>> [laughter]


>> What
 is
 sleep?
 [gasps]


Okay,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 saying
 they're


about
 to
 go
 to
 sleep.
 Well,
 you
 can


maybe
 not
 have
 any
 nightmares
 going
 to


sleep.
 Dude,
 that's
 the
 worst
 thing
 for


some
 of
 the
 international
 folks,
 right?


Like,
 you
 got
 to
 go
 to
 sleep,
 but
 you


see
 the
 market
 crashing.
 Like,
 my
 uncle


does
 that
 all
 the
 time.
 He's
 like,
 "All


right,
 dude.
 I
 got
 to
 sleep.
 Markets
 are


okay.
 Make
 sure
 when
 I
 wake
 up
 the
 [ __ ]


doesn't
 go
 the
 opposite
 direction."
 And


I
 was
 like,
 "I'll
 try.


410
 right
 there
 on
 Tesla.


Wow.
 Complete
 reversal
 from
 the


pre-markets.


Oh
 yeah,
 it's
 only
 8:30
 in
 California
 on


the
 West
 Coast,
 dude.


Still
 super
 early


on
 the
 West
 Coast.


Currently
 baking
 and
 had
 a
 later


breakfast,
 so
 no
 lunch.


I
 don't
 think
 I've
 had
 breakfast
 on
 a


weekday
 in
 three
 years.


Like
 legit
 eating
 in
 the
 morning
 before


the
 show.
 I
 don't
 think
 I've
 done
 that


in
 three
 years.
 I
 just
 like
 it's
 hard
 to


eat
 and
 then
 talk
 for
 four
 hours.


But
 lunch
 might
 not
 be
 in
 the
 worst


position
 today.
 Palenteer
 176.
 Hoodie


125.
 Wow.
 S&P
 is
 moving
 past
 674.


67480.


Hood
 126.


Where's
 Rocket
 Lab?
 Are
 we
 back
 to
 50?


Rock
 Lab.
 Not
 50
 yet,
 but
 47.


Um,


I
 only
 get
 out
 of
 bed
 for
 breakfast.


Well,
 I
 get
 out
 of
 bed
 because
 I
 I
 tend


to
 wake
 up
 a
 bit
 more
 early
 and
 I
 got
 to


get
 ready
 for
 the
 show
 and
 I
 somehow


manage
 to
 be
 late
 every
 day
 still.
 But,


um,


it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 eat
 breakfast.
 You


are
 seeing
 these
 names
 go
 again.
 Now,
 I


I
 just
 want
 to
 say
 if
 we
 still
 end
 red


for
 the
 day,
 let's
 say
 we
 end
 at
 669,


which
 would
 be
 way
 better
 than
 where
 we


were
 in
 the
 pre-markets,
 that's
 a
 win.


That
 is
 a
 win.
 As
 much
 as
 it's
 going
 to


suck,
 it
 is
 a
 win.
 The
 goal
 is
 to
 not
 be


at
 the
 Friday
 lows
 from
 last
 week,
 which


we
 were
 less
 than
 half
 a
 percent
 away
 of


getting
 to
 um
 in
 the
 morning.
 So
 it
 is
 a


win
 if
 we
 see
 any
 level
 of
 momentum


around
 669
 670.
 Anything
 above
 that
 is
 a


cherry
 on
 top.


Anything
 above
 that
 is
 a
 cherry
 on
 top.


And
 wow
 18%
 look
 at
 that
 move.


Um
 Tesla
 from
 382
 to
 410


and
 then
 grab
 from
 530
 to
 552.


Is
 Bitcoin
 making
 any
 move
 to
 help?


Bitcoin
 96.8.
 All right.
 Bitcoin's
 up


from
 94.


Bitcoin's
 up
 from
 94.
 BMR
 obviously
 not


moving
 like
 crazy
 even
 though
 it
 is
 up


from
 the
 lows
 because
 Ethereum
 not


moving
 that
 high
 above
 32
 but
 you
 do


have
 the
 bleeding
 that's
 starting
 to


stop
 Nvidia
 now
 over
 190
 as
 well
 which


is
 great
 to
 see.


All
 right
 folks
 I
 think
 that's
 it
 for


the
 market
 open.
 I
 mean
 we'll
 be
 back
 on


the
 close.
 We'll
 see
 what
 we
 got
 going


on.
 We
 got
 a
 startup
 that'll
 be
 on
 the


close.
 So,
 we'll
 do
 an
 interview
 with


them
 and
 get
 to
 see
 kind
 of
 what
 they're


doing
 in
 the
 crypto
 space.
 I
 think
 Steve


will
 be
 on.
 He
 should
 be
 able
 to
 be
 on,


so
 we
 should
 get
 him
 on
 as
 well.


And
 uh
 we'll
 see
 how
 this
 turns
 out.
 I
 I


do
 just
 want
 to
 say
 I
 don't
 fully
 think


we're
 out
 of
 the
 woods.
 I
 mean,
 again,


it's
 it's
 I
 think
 too
 naive
 to
 say
 that


the
 market
 won't
 whipsaw
 this
 down
 for


whatever
 reason
 they
 want,
 but
 it's
 a


very
 healthy
 move
 up.
 I
 mean,
 for
 Nvidia


to
 go
 red,
 it
 has
 to
 lose
 2%.
 And
 then


for
 it
 to
 go
 anywhere
 near
 where
 it
 was


in
 the
 pre-market,
 it
 has
 to
 lose


another
 2%.
 About
 a
 4%
 reversal.
 That


could
 happen,
 but
 it
 has
 to
 like
 really


be
 a
 lot
 of
 selling
 pressure
 two
 and
 a


half
 hours
 into
 the
 market
 open
 for
 that


to
 take
 place,


which


seems
 like
 it
 might
 not
 have
 as
 easy
 of


a
 trajectory.


Not
 bad,
 folks.
 Not
 bad.
 All
 of
 us
 here


just
 staring
 at
 these
 candles
 go
 up
 and


down
 trying
 to
 see
 if
 we
 can
 have
 a
 shot


at
 holding
 on
 to
 this
 bull
 market
 end
 of


year.
 And
 then
 he
 got
 this
 Trump
 tweet


that
 just
 made
 a
 complete
 pivot
 on
 the


Epstein
 thing.
 I
 mean
 again
 I
 don't
 know


if
 the
 Trump
 tweet
 the
 market
 reacted
 to


but
 as
 that
 came
 out
 that's
 when
 we


broke
 above
 670.
 could
 have
 just
 been
 a


coincidence.


But
 the
 pivot
 of
 what
 he's
 thinking
 in


terms
 of
 this
 investigation,


ultimately
 the
 market's
 going
 to
 have
 to


figure
 out
 how
 to
 react
 to
 that
 long


term
 and
 the
 implications
 of
 that.


But
 this
 is
 just
 a
 crazy
 crazy
 market
 to


cover
 every
 day


with
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 twists
 and


turns.


There
 you
 go,
 Tess
 right
 there
 at
 408.
 E


Penny,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Himemed,
 thanks
 again
 for
 your
 stream.


What's
 your
 take
 on
 BMR
 and
 the


administration
 change?
 Uh,
 I
 think
 the


administration
 is
 super
 bullish
 for
 BMR


in
 terms
 of
 the
 Trump
 administration
 and


the
 policies
 that
 they're
 passing.
 In


terms
 of
 these
 new
 CEOs
 and
 executive


directors
 that
 Bitmine
 uh
 put
 on
 the


board
 today,
 I
 have
 no
 clue
 because
 I


did
 not
 look
 into
 them.
 Uh,
 I
 would


imagine
 Tom
 Lee
 has
 relatively
 good


insight
 on
 people
 and
 that's
 why
 he's


been
 able
 to
 build
 fund
 strat.
 So,
 I


would
 have
 to
 research
 some
 of
 the
 folks


that
 he
 appointed
 onto
 the
 board,
 but


yeah,
 I
 just
 really
 have
 not
 looked
 at


any
 of
 those
 people
 yet.
 Sage,
 thank
 you


for
 the
 $20
 super
 chat,
 man.
 Appreciate


you.
 Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 Paul


Chen,
 thank
 you
 for
 becoming
 a
 channel


member
 as
 well.


And
 thank
 you
 guys
 for
 being
 here
 on


today.
 All right,
 word
 of
 the
 day.
 Let's


end
 off
 the
 market
 open
 with
 a
 correct


pronunciation
 of
 the
 word
 of
 the
 day.


And
 that'll
 lead
 us
 into
 the
 uh
 the


close.


Then
 if
 we
 can
 end
 green,
 it
 would
 be,


you
 know,
 it'll
 be
 funny.
 If
 we
 end
 at


around
 this
 level,
 672,
 674,
 that's


basically
 where
 we
 were
 last
 Friday,


which
 means
 if
 you
 had
 just
 not
 looked


at
 your
 portfolio
 for
 a
 week,
 nothing


would
 have
 happened.
 If
 we
 end
 at
 this


level,
 we
 are
 where
 we
 are
 on
 Friday.


Remember
 how
 good
 we
 felt
 last
 Friday


when
 we
 had
 the
 Vshape
 from
 the
 shutdown


headline?


Uh,
 it's
 basically
 the
 same
 thing
 except


there
 was
 no
 headline.
 It
 was
 just
 buyer


stepping
 in.


Okay.
 Word
 of
 the
 day.
 [sighs]


Um,


okay.
 I
 have
 two
 ways
 I
 want
 to
 say


this.
 I'm
 not
 looking
 at
 the


pronunciation.
 I'm
 just
 looking
 at
 how
 I


would
 say
 it.


Apadict.
 Apadictic.


Podictic.
 how
 you
 say
 it.
 I
 don't
 even


want
 to
 look
 at
 the
 comments
 given
 the


middle
 of
 that
 word.
 Describe
 something


that
 is
 clearly
 established,
 undeniably


true,
 or
 logically
 certain.
 The
 kind
 of


statement
 that
 can't
 be
 disputed.


Why
 did
 Why
 did
 Chachik
 have
 to
 pick


this
 type
 of
 freaking
 word,
 dude?
 Why


did
 like
 first
 sagacious,
 now
 this
 [ __ ]


[sighs]


>> Appidictic.


>> Okay,
 so
 I
 got
 the
 a
 wrong
 on
 this.
 I


said
 ah
 versus
 e.
 That's
 why
 English
 is


stupid.


But
 appictic
 that
 is
 the
 word


appictic.


>> Appidictic.


>> Something
 that
 is
 clearly
 established,


undeniably
 true
 or
 logically
 certain.


The
 kind
 of
 statement
 that
 can't
 be


disputed.
 His
 argument
 wasn't
 just


convincing.
 It
 was
 apppedictic,
 leaving


no
 room
 for
 rebuttal.
 I
 actually
 I
 think


I
 I
 will
 use
 this
 word.


I
 mean
 again
 this
 com
 like
 I
 I
 think
 the


comparisons
 to
 the.com
 bubble
 are
 not


apppidictic.
 It's
 very
 difficult
 to


establish
 something
 that's
 super
 logical


to
 say
 we
 are
 in
 a
 do
 type
 of
 scenario.


Use
 it
 with
 your
 grinder
 data.


Chad
 GBT
 watches
 this
 show.


These
 freaking
 words,
 dude.
 Sagacious.


Appid
 addictic.


All right,
 that's
 it.
 That's
 what
 we


got.
 Thank
 you
 all
 for
 being
 here.
 It's


been
 a
 super
 super
 crazy
 day.
 Super


volatile.
 I
 I
 One
 thing
 I
 also
 want
 to


say
 is
 give
 yourself
 some
 grace.
 On
 days


like
 this
 and
 on
 weeks
 like
 this,
 give


yourself
 some
 grace.
 No
 human
 is


perfect.
 It's
 never
 easy
 to
 time
 the
 top


or
 bottom.
 You
 might
 have
 bought
 a
 stock


that
 went
 down
 10%
 this
 week.
 You
 might


have
 sold
 a
 stock
 before
 it
 V-shaped


back
 up
 5%.
 Like,
 you're
 all
 human
 at


the
 end
 of the
 day.
 No
 one's
 perfect.


Buffett,
 Aman,
 Ter,
 these
 guys
 also
 make


mistakes
 as
 well.
 and
 you're
 competing


against
 very
 sophisticated
 algorithms,


which
 is
 why
 the
 best
 way
 to
 win
 is
 to


DCA
 and
 buy
 the
 companies
 that
 you


believe
 in
 and
 not
 sell
 them
 on
 the
 days


that
 they
 take
 a
 big
 dip
 because
 you


want
 to
 continue
 holding
 on
 to
 those


names
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 So
 on
 weeks
 like


this,
 as
 tough
 and
 as
 annoying
 it
 is


sometimes,
 you
 know,
 you
 feel
 like


you're
 just
 getting
 punched
 by
 the


market.
 Just
 remember
 a
 couple
 months


ago,
 you
 felt
 like
 you
 were
 punching
 the


market
 and
 so
 it's
 a
 fight
 back
 and


forth.
 But
 if
 you
 are
 in
 a
 solid
 company


that
 you
 believe
 in
 and
 you've
 done
 your


own
 due
 diligence
 and
 you're
 not
 super


leveraged
 or
 heavily
 on
 margin,
 like


you're
 going
 to
 survive.
 You're
 going
 to


be
 okay.


The
 world
 is
 not
 going
 to
 fall
 apart.


And
 going
 back
 to
 the
 beginning
 of
 the


show,
 and
 for
 those
 that
 didn't
 hear
 at


the
 beginning
 of
 the
 show,
 if
 you
 want


to
 go
 back
 to
 those
 first
 30
 minutes,
 we


we
 really
 went
 in
 depth
 on
 are
 these


structural
 problems
 we're
 seeing
 in
 the


market,
 aka
 foundational
 paradigmatic


changes
 for
 how
 investors
 should
 be


thinking
 about
 allocating
 capital,
 or


are
 they
 idiosyncratic
 anomalies
 that


are
 of
 the
 moment,
 but
 are
 not


fundamental
 changes
 in
 how
 you
 should
 be


thinking
 of
 the
 current
 state
 of
 the


stock
 market?
 And
 if
 it's
 not


structural,
 not
 saying
 it
 can't
 become


structural,
 but
 at
 the
 moment,
 if
 it's


not,
 then
 it's
 not
 something
 to
 be
 the


most
 afraid
 of.


And
 you
 got
 to
 give
 yourself
 some
 grace


on
 on
 weeks
 like
 this.


All
 right,
 that's
 it.
 Thank
 everybody.


Appreciate
 you
 all.
 We'll
 be
 back
 on
 the


market
 close
 and
 I
 will
 see
 you
 guys


later
 throughout
 the
 day
 and
 we'll
 see


how
 this
 market
 ends
 up
 turning
 out.


Thank
 you
 everybody.
 Love
 you
 all.


Appreciate
 you
 guys.
 See
 you
 on
 the


market
 close.
 Bye
 everybody.
 Have
 a
 good


one.
