[Speaker 0]:  investment demand has replaced draly consumption as the largest source of demand with individual and institutional investors becoming the dominant force in the medium to long term。
[Speaker 0]:  although the federal reserves monetary policy tends to be cautious，
[Speaker 0]:  it has not changed the long term。
[Speaker 0]:  missing expectations about geoconcerns about geopolitical risks against the backdp of the dolarization global mainstream institutions will continuously increase their deducation of precious medals，
[Speaker 0]:  and the demand from central banks are very countries remain strong，
[Speaker 0]:  giving prices uward potential in the medium and long term。
[Speaker 0]:  one analyst concern is that the twenty four hour price fluctuation of gold reach fourteen percent similar to that of bitcoin during its peak。
[Speaker 0]:  can it still be considered a safe haven？
[Speaker 0]:  asasthe gogolball market has lasted for three years，
[Speaker 0]:  and the value of precious medals has undergone significant changes。
[Speaker 0]:  the value of gold and other precious medals has spilled over into other precious medals。
[Speaker 0]:  in twenty twenty five，
[Speaker 0]:  the increase in silver prices exceeded that of gold。
[Speaker 0]:  one of the main reasons been that silver has stronger industrial properties，
[Speaker 0]:  wider industrial applications and origent supply gap lead to greater price elasticity for silver，
[Speaker 0]:  other precious medals such as platanum and poladium，
[Speaker 0]:  as well as rare industrial medals have extremely limited supply and weak supply chains。
[Speaker 0]:  couple ed as rrereplaceable industrial properties as industrial application scenario continued to expand demand has greater lastiity。
[Speaker 0]:  this unconventional investment trend involving in copper bars has recently emerged，
[Speaker 0]:  attracting the attention of some businesses and customers packaged popoor mans gold。
[Speaker 0]:  its market price has surged the london ddexexchange seven monmonth copper price rose by eleven point six，
[Speaker 0]:  nine percent in dember price has twenty ent with on anuary。
[Speaker 0]:  six of this year，
[Speaker 0]:  it strongly broke through the US thirteen thousand four hundred seven dollars per tunmark，
[Speaker 0]:  setting a new historical record。
[Speaker 0]:  the shenjen market also saw a brief surgein copper bar investment with one thousand gracocoper bars being sold for one hundred eighty to two hundred ninety nine。
[Speaker 0]:  new on a price，
[Speaker 0]:  even merchants found in comprehensible，
[Speaker 0]:  noting the processing fees were more expensive than the corporate cell recycling was only possible through scrap metal dealers。
[Speaker 0]:  some merchants stated they would sell but not buy back the bars around january twenty eoth。
[Speaker 0]:  the chinjen market urgtly ally alted，
[Speaker 0]:  the public public sale of copper bars。
[Speaker 0]:  why did copper bars become a popular investment craze？
[Speaker 0]:  firstly，
[Speaker 0]:  the high price of precious medals trigger to demand for alternatives with gold den silver prices，
[Speaker 0]:  soaring ordinary investor space。
[Speaker 0]:  the demma not be able to four gold，
[Speaker 0]:  but fearing missing out on potential gains，
[Speaker 0]:  thus seeking low pressuld alternatives 是不有回据。
[Speaker 0]:  secondly，
[Speaker 0]:  businesses were driven by profit。
[Speaker 0]:  some merchants admitted that selling copper bars was a way to attract customers and then promote silver and gold sales。
[Speaker 0]:  notably，
[Speaker 0]:  the topic investing in copper bars，
[Speaker 0]:  gain significant attraction on social media platforms and the immplification effect of this content，
[Speaker 0]:  further stimulated investment in copper bars。
[Speaker 0]:  when market sentiment was ignited，
[Speaker 0]:  merchants quickly sold off their stock through online promotion in private orders，
[Speaker 0]:  shifting the risk to investors。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  compared to gold，
[Speaker 0]:  which has a well established recycling system with small small price spreads。
[Speaker 0]:  copper bars are essentially industrial ramaterials with high processing fees as on a copper price around one hundred thousand u。
[Speaker 0]:  one and broken down into one thousand one kilogram coppbars。
[Speaker 0]:  each should cost one hundred d on，
[Speaker 0]:  but they were sold for over one hundred eighty unon mark。
[Speaker 0]:  up over over fifty percent。
[Speaker 0]:  the futures price of coper is over one hundred thousand u，
[Speaker 0]:  one per ten，
[Speaker 0]:  and after processing into copper ars ars，
[Speaker 0]:  the rises to one hundred twenty thousand to one hundred thirty thousand d one per tent。
[Speaker 0]:  this means the ordinary investors would need the copper price to double to break even。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  even in the soaring coppu on per twenty twenty five，
[Speaker 0]:  the cumulative annual increase was only about thirty percent，
[Speaker 0]:  making a double in price highly unlikely if the purchase pris one hundred eighty u on per kilogram，
[Speaker 0]:  but if you want to sell it，
[Speaker 0]:  the scrap hello recycling station only recognizes the boilpoint price price is currently tly NEDU on buying and selling would instantly reduce your capital by more than fifty percent。
[Speaker 0]:  industry insiders remind that many retail investors think that since they can't afford goal，
[Speaker 0]:  bars，
[Speaker 0]:  buying copper bars is an acid allocation under consumption downgrading，
[Speaker 0]:  which is a misconception and a logical fallacy。
[Speaker 0]:  the essence of investment is buying liquidity and expected appreciation not buying copper。

[Speaker 0]:  hangkn police have recovered a proximately eleven milliyen，
[Speaker 0]:  but the remaining forty million yen is still being tracked。
[Speaker 0]:  furthermore，

[Speaker 0]:  ymbbin said he never wore those clothes，
[Speaker 0]:  and the picture was fake。
[Speaker 0]: 没有 the public security authorities investigation found that he was never resolld。
[Speaker 0]:  this also supports the view that many people who go to online gambling parks in southeast asia do so voluntarily。

[Speaker 0]:  not only only were the debs，
[Speaker 0]:  not recovered，
[Speaker 0]:  but they also found a different go to contact these companies。
[Speaker 0]:  again，
[Speaker 0]:  there are dozens of such complaints in fish。
[Speaker 0]:  one alone。
[Speaker 0]:  one complainant stated that in november twenty twenty five，
[Speaker 0]:  they establish a legal service intrustment relationship with a legal consulting company and employ of the company，
[Speaker 0]:  acting as a ligal consultant，
[Speaker 0]:  collected seventeen thousand u on in five instalments，
[Speaker 0]:  under the guys of coordination fees and procedural fees，
[Speaker 0]:  yet the two thousand u on dead remains unrecovered in twenty twenty twenty。
[Speaker 0]:  the siish one provincial public security department issued a statement reminding the public that so called legal consulting companies，
[Speaker 0]:  legal firms and rights protection centers are usually limited liability companies registered with market supervision。
[Speaker 0]:  partments companies are social organizations registered with the company registry or civil affairs department only hold business licences，

[Speaker 0]:  a normal laffirm charges。
[Speaker 0]:  thousands of you on for a case，
[Speaker 0]:  while these legal consulting ananies yare to charge only a few hundred you one，
[Speaker 0]:  because their purpose is not to take cases，
[Speaker 0]:  but to collect money，
[Speaker 0]:  the trickers to attract dditors with consulltations then promifalalsely。
[Speaker 0]:  they can recover one hundred percent of the money in a few hundred year。
[Speaker 0]:  one after receiving the money，
[Speaker 0]:  they will charge again using reasons such as exceeding the statute limitations tions other party transfererasassets titil creditor，
[Speaker 0]:  suddenly realizes the samm or is completely rebuck。
[Speaker 0]:  after being exposed，
[Speaker 0]:  some legal consulting companies，
[Speaker 0]:  find it more difficult operate and will spend money to see cooperation with lafents using the public trust in law firms to obtain more clients law firms due to the fierce competition，
[Speaker 0]:  find it difficult to obtain cases，
[Speaker 0]:  and sometimes even proactively compcontlelegal fsulting companies。
[Speaker 0]:  since twenty twenty four，
[Speaker 0]:  judicial and public security departments have repeatedly launch join ackackackns on fraud and false promises under the guise lawyers。
[Speaker 0]:  on january six of this year，
[Speaker 0]:  a company engaged in legal consulting in deck collection in WUHAGGAGU software park had about two hundred people arrested。
[Speaker 0]:  how can ordinary people identify decollection scams？

[Speaker 0]:  second，
[Speaker 0]:  lawyers and lawfirms will not make absolutely promises for most private lending disputes。
[Speaker 0]:  the difficulty lies not in little gation，
[Speaker 0]:  but in enforcement，
[Speaker 0]:  the success rate of fuenforforceis less than ten percent。
[Speaker 0]:  therefore，
[Speaker 0]:  any promise of one hundred percent recovery is suspect third be wary of the charging method。
[Speaker 0]:  regular laphms will provide a detailed fee schedule before authorization clearly stating the purpose standard ard each fee，
[Speaker 0]:  while legal consulting companies often have vague fee terms using low prices as big，
[Speaker 0]:  followed by a series of charges。
[Speaker 0]:  okay。
