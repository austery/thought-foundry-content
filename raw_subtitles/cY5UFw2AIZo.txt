All
 right,
 back
 with
 us
 in
 place
 of


David
 Freeberg
 who's
 busy
 this
 week
 is


the
 one,
 the
 only
 on
 his
 fourth


appearance
 here
 on
 the
 All-In
 podcast,


Mr.
 Tucker
 Paulson.
 How
 are
 you,
 Tucker?


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> Hey,
 Tucker.
 Good
 to
 see
 you.


>> David,
 David,
 how
 do
 you
 have
 time
 for


every
 time
 I
 every
 time
 I
 turn
 on
 my


phone,
 there's
 like
 David
 Sachs
 on


something
 incredibly
 complex.
 Like,
 are


you
 sleeping?
 usually
 people
 attacking


me
 for
 something,


>> but
 it's
 not
 just
 like,
 oh,
 your
 views


are
 this
 or
 that
 geopolitical
 conflict.


It's
 like
 the
 details
 of
 something


very
 complicated.
 And
 I'm
 just
 like,


wow,
 man.
 That's
 a
 lot.
 That's
 a
 lot
 to


digest.


>> Yeah.
 There's
 not
 a
 very
 high
 bar
 in


Washington,
 as
 you
 know.


>> You're
 a
 giant
 among
 pygmies,
 but
 still,


it's
 a
 lot
 of
 work.


>> In
 the
 land
 of
 the
 blind,
 the
 oneeyed


man
 is
 king.


>> King.
 Exactly.
 Exactly.


>> Are
 you
 still
 enjoying
 it?
 Yeah,
 it's


been
 a
 lot
 of
 fun.
 Well,
 you
 know,


President
 Trump's
 a
 lot
 of
 fun
 to
 work


for.


>> He's
 the
 most
 fun.


>> I
 mean,
 the
 best,
 right?


>> He
 got
 a
 big
 shout
 out
 yesterday.
 It
 was


really
 awesome,
 actually.


>> David
 did.


>> Yeah.
 Huge
 shout
 out.


>> That's
 right.
 We
 were
 at
 the
 White
 House


Christmas
 party.
 I
 think
 they
 do
 like
 25


of
 these.


>> Yeah.
 Literally.


>> Literally,
 cuz
 they
 got
 so
 many


thousands
 of
 people,
 but
 they
 can
 only


fit
 a
 couple
 hundred
 people
 in
 the
 White


House
 and
 they're
 doing
 like
 two
 a
 day.


And
 the
 president
 comes
 down
 and
 gives
 a


speech
 and
 every
 speech
 is
 different.


You
 know,
 it's
 like
 a
 Dave
 Chappelle


comedy
 routine
 where
 he
 never
 does
 the


same
 set
 and
 he
 does
 it
 with
 so
 much


enthusiasm
 and
 gusto.
 You
 would
 think


that
 you
 were
 the
 only,


>> you
 know,
 holiday
 party
 crowd
 that
 he


ever
 addressed.


>> He
 never
 expresses
 any
 irritation
 at
 at


doing
 that.
 He
 loves
 it.
 It's
 like


amazing.


>> It's
 unbelievable.


>> But
 in
 any
 event,
 he
 gave
 me
 a
 shout
 out


during
 the
 speech
 and
 then
 he
 called
 me


up
 there
 to
 like,
 hey,
 can
 you
 say
 a


couple
 words
 about
 AI?
 And
 I'm
 like,


well,
 this
 isn't
 exactly
 Chris's
 party


conversation.
 So,
 I
 just
 kind
 of
 talked


about
 how
 great
 he
 was
 and
 um
 how
 much


fun
 it
 was
 to
 work
 for
 him.
 And
 then
 he


gave
 Chamatha
 a
 shout
 out


>> as
 well.


>> No
 way.


>> And
 he
 just
 starts
 talking
 about
 the


All-In
 Pod.
 Like,
 we're
 in
 the
 audience


and
 he
 just
 starts
 having
 a
 conversation


with
 us
 about
 the
 All-In
 Pod
 and
 how's


it
 doing?
 And
 you
 know,


>> the
 funniest
 part
 was
 he
 says
 to
 me,


"Oh,"
 and
 then
 Nat
 was
 behind
 him.
 So,


he
 goes,
 "Hey,
 Nat."
 And
 he
 says,
 "I


hope
 everything's
 going
 well.
 How's
 your


relationship?"
 He
 looks
 at
 me
 and
 I'm


like
 this
 and
 then
 Nat's
 behind
 her.
 Me


going
 like
 this.


>> Oh,
 it's
 so
 awesome.
 I'm
 going
 this


weekend
 cuz
 I
 miss
 him.


>> You're
 going
 to
 see
 him
 this
 weekend?


You
 guys
 are
 on
 good
 terms.
 Tuck


>> with
 Trump.
 Oh,
 yeah.
 The
 best.
 I
 mean,


the
 best.
 I
 mean,
 of
 course,
 people
 have


told
 him,
 many
 people
 that
 he's
 not


allowed
 to
 talk
 to
 me.
 So,
 that
 just


makes
 him
 like
 me
 much
 more
 cuz
 like
 all


he
 hears
 is,
 "Oh,
 he's"
 People
 be
 like,


"He's
 the
 worst
 human
 being
 who's
 ever


lived."
 And
 all
 Trump
 hears
 is
 who's


ever
 lived,
 you
 know,
 and
 he's
 just
 that


he's
 just
 he's
 you
 can't
 control
 him


that
 way.
 Period.
 So,
 no,
 I
 get
 along


with
 him
 literally
 in
 25
 years
 better


than
 I
 ever
 have.


>> That's
 good,
 too.


>> It's
 hilarious.
 Yeah.


>> The
 last
 part
 of
 that
 story
 is
 so
 after


he
 calls
 up
 me
 and
 Jimoth,
 actually,
 he


calls
 me
 up
 to
 speak
 and
 then


>> calls
 David
 up
 to
 speak.
 He
 went
 on
 a


little bit
 of
 a
 riff
 saying,
 you
 know,
 I


don't
 like
 the
 term
 artificial


intelligence
 because
 why
 would
 you
 want


to
 call
 it
 artificial?
 It
 sounds
 bad.


>> Why
 don't
 they
 call
 it
 something
 else?


Superior
 intelligence


>> intelligence
 organic.


>> And
 then
 and
 then
 he
 calls
 up
 Chimath.


He's
 like,
 Chimath,
 what
 do
 you
 think?


And
 Chimath
 says,
 well,
 I
 think
 I
 think


AI
 is
 too
 late
 to
 change,
 but
 maybe
 it


could
 be
 American
 intelligence.


>> And
 then
 he
 says,
 yeah,
 but
 you
 know,
 we


want
 this
 to
 be
 used
 by
 the
 whole
 world.


Sell
 it
 to
 the
 whole
 world.
 Anyway,
 we


start
 workshopping
 uh
 this
 branding


exercise.
 in
 front
 of
 the
 entire


Christmas
 party.


>> How
 about
 we
 call
 it
 Trump
 super


intelligence?
 Okay,
 it's
 Trump


intelligence.


>> No,
 but
 you
 know what?
 Calling
 AI


American
 intelligence
 is
 actually
 the


smartest
 and
 best
 one
 could
 do
 around


AI.


>> We
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about,
 Tucker,


you've
 been
 on
 a
 run,
 huh?
 You've
 been


on
 I
 mean,
 not
 in
 my
 world.
 I
 mean,
 I'm


off
 social
 media
 mostly,
 so
 it's
 like


nothing's
 actually
 really
 happening
 in


my
 world.


>> You
 don't
 open
 X
 at
 all.


>> It's
 all
 about
 me,
 man.
 And
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 I
 don't
 like
 to
 read
 about


myself,
 so
 I
 don't
 look
 at
 it.
 No.


>> All
 right.
 For
 topic
 number
 one,


Paramount
 versus
 Netflix.
 They're
 in
 a


bidding
 war
 over
 the
 future
 of
 Warner


Brothers
 and
 all
 that
 amazing
 IP.
 The


assets
 obviously
 many
 of
 us
 know
 Warner


Brothers
 is
 led
 by
 Zazlo,
 David
 Zazlo,


but
 he
 owns
 currently
 HBO,
 DC,
 and
 the


Warner
 Brothers
 collections
 of
 films.


Also,
 they
 have
 that
 great
 studio
 a
 lot.


On
 the
 cable
 side,
 they
 own
 CNN,
 TNT,


Discovery,


and
 uh
 they
 just
 saddled
 that
 company
 up


with
 $30
 billion
 of
 debt.
 And
 they
 had
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 competition
 for
 who


would
 buy
 it.
 Netflix
 and
 Paramount
 Sky


Dance,
 run
 by
 the
 Ellison
 family.


Netflix
 offered
 $83
 billion
 to
 purchase


just
 the
 streaming
 assets,
 which
 would


put
 the
 number
 one
 and
 the
 number
 three


player
 together.
 and
 WBD
 publicly


accepted
 Netflix
 offer
 last
 Friday.
 This


has
 created
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 kurluffle.


Paramount
 now
 is
 coming
 in
 with
 a


hostile
 offer,
 108
 billion
 in
 cash
 for


the
 entire
 company.
 That
 includes
 the


cable
 assets.
 That
 would
 be
 interesting


because
 then
 David
 Ellison,
 son
 of
 Larry


Ellison,
 would
 own
 not
 just
 CBS,


which
 is
 being
 run
 CBS
 News
 by
 your


favorite
 Tucker
 Carlson,
 uh,
 Bari
 Weiss.


She
 would
 also,
 I
 guess,
 own
 and
 run
 CNN


in
 this
 instance
 potentially.
 We'll
 get


to
 that.
 Uh
 the
 $ 108
 billion
 offer


includes
 two
 vehicles,
 41
 billion
 in


equity
 financing
 by
 the
 Ellison
 family


and
 then
 a
 bunch
 of
 other
 folks
 coming


including
 and
 we'll
 get
 to
 this
 uh
 some


Middle
 East
 uh
 sovereign
 wealth
 funds.


Poly
 market
 interestingly
 has
 Paramount


as
 the
 favorite
 at
 51%
 in
 Netflix
 has


dropped
 to
 36%
 even
 though
 they
 say
 they


have
 a
 done
 deal
 and
 14%
 chance
 of
 no


deal.
 I
 think
 that
 might
 be
 the
 free


money
 the
 14%
 chance
 of
 no
 deal.
 What's


your
 take
 on
 this,
 Tucker?
 And
 just


broadly
 speaking,
 consolidation
 in
 media


having
 pulled
 the
 rip
 cord
 and
 left


traditional
 media
 and
 now
 yeah,
 the


understanding
 is
 you're
 doing
 better


than
 ever.
 You
 control
 your
 destiny
 and


I
 think
 you're
 making
 probably
 as
 much


or
 more
 money
 now
 than
 you
 did
 when
 you


were
 working
 for
 the
 men.


>> Yeah,
 I
 don't
 I
 actually
 haven't


checked,
 but
 I'm
 not
 much
 of
 a
 money


guy,
 but
 I'm
 I'm
 fine
 and
 can
 pay
 my


non-existent
 mortgage.


I'm
 against
 monopoly
 power
 in
 general


because
 I
 think
 it
 stifles
 creativity.


I'm
 not
 that
 worried
 about
 this
 because


these,


you
 know,
 these
 things
 never
 move
 in


exactly
 the
 direction
 you
 imagine.
 I've


been
 in
 media
 my
 entire
 life
 and
 none
 of


the
 big
 changes
 I
 anticipated.
 In
 fact,


almost
 all
 of
 them
 I
 made
 fun
 of.
 I
 just


don't
 think
 that
 we're
 really
 threatened


by,


you
 know,
 a
 conglomerate
 of
 CNN
 and


Netflix
 and
 all.
 So
 it's
 like,
 okay,
 you


can
 assemble
 huge
 companies.
 Can
 you


make
 people
 consume
 and
 believe
 the


product?
 You
 know,
 buying
 CBS
 news
 is


like
 buying
 RCA
 records
 or
 something.
 It


like
 just
 doesn't
 have
 any
 effect.
 And


only
 people
 who
 are
 not
 paying
 attention


are
 pretty
 cut
 off
 think
 you're
 going
 to


win
 hearts
 and
 minds
 by
 being
 buying
 CBS


News
 or
 CNN.
 These
 are
 these
 brands
 are


husks.
 In
 fact,
 all
 they
 are
 is
 brands


at
 this
 point.
 And
 I
 just
 am
 not
 at
 all


convinced
 that
 this
 will
 have
 a
 material


effect
 on
 anyone's
 attitudes
 at
 all.
 You


know,
 if
 you
 started
 to
 mess
 with
 what


YouTube
 is
 allowed
 to
 air
 or
 the


ownership
 of
 X,
 you
 know,
 then
 I
 think


you
 could
 could
 really
 change
 the


country
 and
 the
 conversations
 that
 we're


allowed
 to
 have.
 But
 I
 don't
 see
 any
 of


this
 as
 especially
 meaningful
 on
 the


society.
 I
 mean,
 is
 the
 is
 the
 product


going
 to
 get,
 you
 know,
 I
 don't
 know,


more
 subversive
 than
 than
 it
 already
 is?


I
 mean,
 is
 this
 like
 Netflix
 going
 to
 be


worse
 for
 American
 society?
 Probably


not.
 You
 know,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a


business
 story,
 not
 a
 cultural
 story.


Chimath,
 your
 thoughts.
 I'll
 give
 you


two.
 The
 first
 is
 that
 whenever
 you
 see


deals,
 it's
 important
 to
 look
 at
 the


amount
 of
 money
 that
 that
 is
 at
 risk.


And
 that
 is
 the
 best
 tell
 about
 whether


this
 is
 important
 for
 the
 future
 or
 not.


Hundred
 billion
 dollar
 deals
 are


typically
 about
 things
 in
 the
 past.
 What


is
 the
 future?
 Billion
 dollar
 deals.
 So


for
 example,
 when
 you
 look
 at
 when


Facebook
 bought
 Instagram
 for
 a
 billion


dollars,
 that
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 a
 huge


bet
 about
 the
 future,
 it
 was
 right.
 When


Google
 bought
 YouTube
 for
 a
 billion
 six,


that
 was
 a
 huge
 bet
 on
 the
 future.
 They


were
 right.
 When
 Microsoft
 invested
 a


billion
 dollars
 in
 OpenAI,
 that
 was
 a


huge
 bet
 on
 the
 future.
 It
 was
 right.


But
 when
 you
 look
 at
 assets
 that
 trade


at
 hundred
 billion
 dollar
 plus


valuations,
 they're
 so
 undergurtded
 by


debt.
 All
 of
 that
 debt
 is
 only
 ever


bought
 by
 looking
 at
 the
 past.
 Meaning


how
 much
 money
 have
 they
 made
 and
 then


it's
 a
 best
 guess
 about
 how
 much
 money


could
 they
 make
 in
 the
 future.
 So
 these


multiund
 billion
 assets
 to
 Tucker's


point,
 they
 don't
 really
 matter
 that


much.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 super


anti-competitive.
 These
 are
 financial


transactions.
 The
 reality
 in
 media,
 so


specifically
 about
 this
 deal.
 So
 that's


a
 general
 statement
 about
 deal
 quantum


and
 you
 can
 just
 judge
 the
 importance


based
 on
 that.
 People
 should
 be
 spending


much
 more
 time
 looking
 at
 billion
 dollar


transactions
 and
 hundred
 billion
 dollar


transactions.
 That's
 my
 takeaway
 there.


But
 at
 the
 very
 specific
 thing
 about


this
 deal,
 the
 reality
 is
 that
 the


future
 is
 unscripted,
 uncontrolled,


userenerated
 content.
 You
 see
 it
 on


YouTube.
 It
 is
 already
 the
 800
 lb


gorilla
 in
 the
 space.
 And
 then


separately,
 it's
 now
 becoming
 about


shorter
 form
 video.
 And
 you
 see
 that


with
 things
 like
 Instagram
 reels
 and
 Tik


Tok.
 None
 of
 that
 landscape
 will
 change


based
 on
 this
 deal.
 If
 anything,
 if


those
 trends
 accelerate,


the
 value
 of
 historic
 IP
 is
 going
 to


erode
 even
 faster.
 Meaning,
 this


generation
 of
 kids
 will
 have
 no
 idea
 or


care
 about
 the
 Marvel
 Cinematic


Universe,
 about
 Star
 Wars,
 and
 that
 may


upset
 those
 of
 us
 who
 are
 nostalgically


tied
 to
 it.
 So,
 I
 don't know.
 I
 would


let
 the
 deal
 happen.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


particularly
 that
 important.


Saxs,
 obviously
 you
 don't
 speak
 for
 the


administration
 on
 these
 issues,
 but
 I'm


curious
 your
 thoughts
 on
 this.


>> Yeah,
 just
 my
 personal
 view
 on
 this
 is


that
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 meaningful


consolidation
 in
 the
 industry
 either
 way


because
 either
 Netflix
 and
 Warers
 are


going
 to
 merge
 or
 Paramount
 and
 Warers


are
 going
 to
 merge.
 So
 either
 way,


you're
 going
 to
 get
 consolidation.
 But


that
 being
 said,
 if
 Netflix
 is
 allowed


to
 buy
 Warers,
 the
 antitrust
 concerns


are
 a
 lot
 more
 serious
 because
 Netflix


really
 is
 the
 800
 lb
 gorilla
 in


Hollywood
 right
 now.
 It's
 the
 number
 one


streamer
 by
 far.
 It's
 got
 the
 biggest


market
 cap.
 And
 they're
 the
 party
 who


the
 rest
 of
 Hollywood
 is
 freaked
 out


about
 right
 now.
 And
 so
 you
 saw
 that
 the


Hollywood
 unions
 like
 the
 WGA


sag.
 They
 oppose
 the
 deal
 because


they're
 fearing
 job
 cuts,
 lower
 wages,


worsen
 conditions
 due
 to
 reduced
 demand


for
 talent.
 And
 then
 the
 the
 content


creators
 and
 distributors
 are
 worried


about
 this
 too
 because


Netflix
 is
 known
 for
 making
 tougher


deals
 I
 think
 than
 the
 traditional


studios.
 I've
 got
 a
 friend
 who's
 a


showrunner
 in
 Hollywood,
 and
 he's
 done


projects
 with
 both
 Netflix
 and
 with
 the


studios,
 traditional
 studios,
 and
 he


says
 the
 big
 difference
 is
 Netflix
 will


pay
 you
 pretty
 well,
 but
 you
 don't
 get


any
 equity
 in
 your
 show.
 Like
 whatever


you
 get
 is
 sort
 of
 agreed
 to
 at
 the


beginning
 and
 that's
 it.
 So,
 you're
 not


really
 an
 entrepreneur
 when
 you
 do
 a


show
 for
 them.
 But
 when
 you
 then
 work


for
 a
 studio,
 you
 actually
 get
 a
 back


end.
 Now
 there's
 all
 sorts
 of,
 you
 know,


Hollywood
 accounting
 associated
 with


that,
 but
 he
 kind
 of
 misses
 the
 days


that
 are
 going
 away
 where
 he
 got
 to
 be
 a


little
 bit
 of
 an
 entrepreneur
 and
 have


real
 upside
 in
 his
 shows.
 And
 if
 Netflix


now
 is
 allowed
 to
 acquire
 Warner


Brothers
 and
 that's
 just
 another
 nail
 in


that
 whole
 coffin.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 it
 is


a
 big
 change
 and
 if
 the
 antitrust


regulators
 look
 at
 this,
 I
 do
 think
 that


Paramount
 has
 a
 better
 chance.
 The
 other


big
 factor
 is
 just
 that


Paramount's
 offering
 more.
 They
 up
 the


bid.


>> It's
 108
 billion
 versus
 around
 80
 or
 was


like
 $30
 a
 share
 versus
 27.
 And
 they're


also
 buying
 the
 whole
 company
 whereas


Netflix
 just
 wants
 Warner's


>> studio
 assets
 and
 streaming
 assets
 like


HBO
 as
 opposed
 to
 the
 cable
 assets
 which


are
 considered
 a
 little bit
 of
 a
 co.
 So,


I
 think
 if
 you're
 a
 shareholder
 in


Warers,
 you
 probably
 want
 to
 sell
 the


whole
 thing.
 You
 don't
 want
 to
 just
 be


stuck
 with
 the
 bad
 assets.
 So,


>> yeah,


>> I'm
 a
 little
 surprised
 actually
 that
 the


Warner
 board
 went
 with
 Netflix
 when
 they


had
 Paramount
 as
 an
 option,
 assuming


this
 Paramount
 offer
 was
 on
 the
 table,


because
 it
 seems
 like
 a
 better
 deal,
 and


it's
 probably
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 likely


to
 get
 through
 the
 regulators.
 So,
 I


guess
 I'm
 a
 little
 bit
 surprised
 they


chose
 Netflix,
 but
 I
 guess
 Netflix
 is


the
 more
 bonafideed
 party,
 right?
 It's


$400
 billion
 market
 cap
 and
 maybe
 they


thought
 that
 they're
 more
 able
 to


execute
 this
 transaction.


>> Yeah,
 I
 have
 only
 three
 points
 on
 this.


Number
 one,


it
 really
 depends
 on
 how
 you
 frame


competitors
 in
 this
 space.
 Here's
 your


paid
 streaming
 platforms,
 Netflix,


Disney,
 and
 HBO.
 Disney's
 done
 an


amazing
 job
 after
 starting
 a
 decade


after
 Netflix
 with
 streaming
 of
 really


getting
 a
 lot
 of
 subscribers
 and


consolidating
 one
 in
 three
 here


obviously
 puts
 Disney
 way
 behind.
 But
 if


you
 start
 looking
 at
 Tik
 Tok,
 Instagram,


YouTube,
 these
 properties
 have
 the


majority
 of
 the
 audience.
 They
 dwarf
 the


audience
 of
 these
 paid
 services.
 And


young
 people
 are
 not
 interested
 in


movies
 anymore.
 They
 want
 obviously
 Tik


Toks
 and
 YouTube.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the


revenue,
 it's
 a


>> ask
 you
 a
 question
 about
 that
 chart


before
 you
 move
 on.
 does
 how
 do
 you


compare
 or
 do
 you
 adjust
 for
 time


watched
 or
 minutes
 because
 how
 do
 you


>> I
 didn't
 in
 this
 but
 yeah
 that
 would


>> a
 big
 difference
 between
 watching
 a
 Tik


Tok
 and
 watching
 you
 know
 a
 movie


>> on
 Netflix
 in
 terms
 of
 attention
 span


>> disagreeing
 with
 you
 about
 the


>> look
 there's
 no
 question
 the
 cultural


significance
 has
 moved
 away
 from


Hollywood


>> towards
 user
 generated
 content
 on
 these


online
 platforms
 but
 I'm
 just
 curious


you
 adjusted
 for
 that


>> yeah
 no
 I
 didn't
 adjust
 for
 that
 you


could
 you
 could
 slice
 it
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 ways
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


you
 I
 put
 the
 competitive
 set
 as
 a


little
 bit
 broader
 here
 um
 which
 is


including
 the
 free
 you
 know
 UGC
 services


since
 that's
 what
 young
 people
 are
 doing


and
 then
 if
 you
 look
 at
 revenue


you
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 slightly
 different


picture
 here
 these
 paid
 services
 are


doing
 extremely
 well
 and
 they
 are


juggernauts
 in
 terms
 of
 making
 money
 and


profitability
 now


and
 UGC


obviously
 is
 much
 larger
 especially
 on
 a


global
 basis
 the
 more
 important
 Third


thing
 here
 is
 how
 we
 do
 antitrust
 in
 the


country.
 Trump
 wants
 to
 be
 involved
 in


this.
 He
 said
 he's
 going
 to
 be
 very


involved
 in
 it,
 you
 know,
 which
 as
 an


80-year-old,
 he's
 involved
 in


everything.
 Why
 not
 be
 involved
 in
 this?


He
 shouldn't
 be.
 Put
 that
 aside.
 I
 think


we
 need
 to
 have
 a
 way
 to
 prevet
 these


and
 then
 just
 let
 the
 highest
 bidder


win.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 this
 concept
 is


getting
 convoluted,
 but
 the
 Ellison's


are
 compromising
 Trump
 a
 bit
 here.
 I


think
 that's
 why
 Trump
 gave
 a
 lot
 of


shine
 to
 Ted
 Sarandos.
 I
 don't know if


you
 saw
 his
 quotes
 about
 that
 sachs,
 but


he
 was
 praising
 what
 a
 genius
 Ted


Sarandos
 is
 and
 how
 amazing
 Netflix
 is.


The
 Ellison's
 coming
 out
 and,
 you
 know,


basically
 saying
 that
 they've
 got
 this


in
 and,
 you
 know,
 they're
 going
 to


basically
 have
 the
 inside
 track
 here,
 I


think
 is
 one
 of
 the
 issues
 I
 propose
 we


have
 a
 prevetting
 of
 these
 large
 deals


because
 we
 want
 M&A
 to
 be
 vibrant
 in


this
 country.
 We
 want
 more
 M&A
 after
 the


wrath
 of
 Lena
 Khan.
 So
 I
 think
 you


should
 be
 able
 to
 prevet
 chimoth.
 You


should
 be
 able
 to
 go
 to
 the
 government


and
 say,
 "Hey,
 we're
 considering
 selling


this
 asset,
 whatever
 it
 happens
 to
 be,


you
 know,
 YouTube
 back
 in
 the
 day.
 Is


there
 anybody
 who's
 not
 able
 to


participate
 in
 this
 auction
 and
 then


just
 have
 the
 FTC
 prevet
 some
 of
 these


and
 then
 highest
 bidder
 seems
 like


what's
 best
 interest
 in
 the
 best


interest
 of
 shareholders."
 So


>> kind
 of
 that's
 untenable.
 And
 the
 reason


why


>> Yeah,
 explain.
 You
 have
 multiple
 facets


of
 antitrust
 that
 can
 come
 up
 from
 any


number
 of
 organizations
 in
 the
 United


States.
 And
 that's
 just
 but
 one
 part
 of


the
 complexities
 you
 have
 to
 navigate


because
 if
 you
 do
 business
 in
 any
 other


country,
 all
 of
 these
 other
 countries


are
 in
 a
 position
 to
 opine.


>> Oh,
 sure.


>> If
 you
 think
 about
 doing
 a
 deal
 where


you're
 in
 China
 and
 that
 other
 asset
 is


in
 China,
 it
 can
 slow
 down
 for
 a
 very,


very,
 very
 long
 time
 and
 never
 happen


for
 reasons
 that
 have
 nothing
 to
 do
 with


the
 industrial
 logic
 of
 the
 merger.
 So
 I


don't
 think
 you
 can
 prevet
 these
 things


because
 it's
 not
 scalable
 and
 I
 think


the
 government
 would
 get
 frustrated


because
 you'd
 have
 a
 thousand
 people


outside
 the
 door.
 They'd
 have
 no
 time
 to


do
 anything
 else.
 They
 have
 to
 govern.


The
 different
 thing
 that
 we
 have
 to


figure
 out
 whether
 is
 allowed
 is
 how


these
 deals
 are
 getting
 done.
 The
 only


thing
 that
 I
 would
 observe
 is
 the
 two


biggest
 transactions
 that
 have
 happened


thus
 far
 this
 year
 that
 I've
 taken
 note


of
 happened
 as
 total
 raw
 asset
 sales
 to


work
 around
 antitrust.
 The
 best
 example


was
 Meta
 and
 Scale
 AI.
 Okay,
 I'll
 say


this
 thing
 is
 worth
 30
 billion.
 I'll


give
 you
 15
 billion
 in
 cash,
 but
 what
 am


I
 really
 doing?
 I'm
 carving
 out
 these


assets
 so
 that
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 file
 even


an
 HSR
 filing.
 So,
 I
 think
 the
 future
 is


that
 if
 the
 government
 has
 to
 have
 an


opinion,
 not
 just
 America,
 but
 the


Europeans,
 the
 Chinese,


what's
 going
 to
 happen
 instead
 is
 that


very
 smart
 lawyers
 who
 get
 paid,
 you


know,
 10,
 20,
 $30
 million
 a
 year,
 the


NBA
 salaries
 now,
 they're
 going
 to
 find


workarounds.
 they've
 already
 done
 so
 for


big
 tech
 and
 I
 think
 it'll
 spill
 over
 to


other
 industries.
 You're
 kind
 of
 like


creating
 these
 boundary
 conditions
 where


I
 think
 the
 concept
 of
 antitrust
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 very
 difficult
 thing


because
 if
 businesses
 want
 to
 be
 in


business,
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 do
 these


traditional
 deals.
 as
 David
 said,
 an


enormous
 sign
 of
 confidence
 about
 how


there
 isn't
 going
 to
 be
 a
 competitive


threat
 for
 Paramount
 to
 just
 say,
 "We'll


take
 the
 whole
 thing."
 Because
 they're


subjecting
 themselves
 to
 a
 level
 of


scrutiny
 that
 they
 wouldn't
 if
 they
 felt


there
 was
 any
 shred
 of
 a
 good
 argument


for
 competitive
 antitrust.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 just
 want
 to
 um
 address
 the
 gratuitous


potshot
 at
 President
 Trump.


>> Which
 one?


>> Well,
 your
 claim
 that
 he
 shouldn't
 get


involved
 and
 somehow
 antitrust
 is
 better


if
 the
 presidents
 don't
 get
 involved.


You
 may
 remember
 that
 Teddy
 Roosevelt


was
 known
 as
 the
 trustbuster
 because
 he


directed
 the
 DOJ
 to
 sue
 45
 companies


under
 the
 Sherman
 Act,
 including
 the


whole
 Northern
 Securities
 Company.
 His


successors,
 William
 Howard
 Taft,
 Woodro


Wilson,
 FDR,
 they
 were
 just
 as


aggressive
 using
 antitrust.
 Anyway,
 a


lot
 of
 presidents
 have
 gotten
 involved


in
 mergers
 and
 antitrust
 actions.
 So,


it's
 just
 not
 that
 unusual.


>> Yeah,
 I
 just
 check
 brought
 to
 you
 by


Grock.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 That's
 great.
 Um,
 yeah.
 We


need
 to
 have
 like
 a
 Grock
 fact
 check


part
 of
 the
 show.


>> We
 We
 need
 a
 Grock
 fact
 check.


>> No,
 the
 reason
 I
 would
 say
 it's


problematic
 for
 Trump
 to
 get
 involved
 in


it
 is
 because
 the
 Ellison's
 have
 also


been
 major
 supporters
 of
 Trump
 and
 made


commitments
 for
 buying
 Tik
 Tok.
 Now
 you


have
 one
 family
 who
 is
 a
 major
 supporter


of
 Trump,
 massive
 donators


basically
 getting
 the
 inside
 line
 on
 Tik


Tok
 and
 now
 after
 a
 deal
 has
 been
 closed


with
 Netflix
 being
 able
 to
 lobby
 to
 get


Trump
 to
 let
 them
 buy
 CBS
 and
 CNN.
 So
 if


we
 start
 thinking
 about
 the
 influence


that
 Ellison,
 the
 Ellison
 family
 is


having
 on
 the
 Trump
 administration,


whether
 it's
 quidd
 proquo
 or
 it's
 the


appearance
 of
 quid
 proquo,
 it's
 best
 for


Trump
 to
 stay
 out
 of
 it
 because
 already


we
 have
 the
 tick
 tock
 deal.
 Now
 CBS
 they


own
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 own
 CNN.
 This


is
 a
 lot
 of
 consolidation
 for
 one
 family


to
 have.


>> That's
 a
 red
 herring.
 Between
 CBS
 and


CNN,
 nine
 people
 watch
 those
 two


channels.
 So
 those
 channels
 are


irrelevant.
 Those
 guys
 have
 to
 rebuild


these
 things
 from
 scratch.
 Number
 one.


And
 number
 two,
 it
 doesn't
 incentivize


or
 disincentivize
 3
 billion
 humans
 from


using
 and
 watching
 that
 content.
 Who


owns
 that
 asset
 is
 not
 known
 to
 any
 of


these
 people.
 CBS
 did
 not
 go
 up
 and
 down


because,
 you
 know,
 one
 person
 owned
 it


versus
 another.
 Nobody
 knows
 who
 the
 CEO


of
 Tik
 Tok
 is.
 It's
 Tik
 Tok
 is
 either


good
 or
 not
 good.
 And
 so,
 I
 would
 just


keep
 in
 mind
 that
 this
 is
 something
 it's


like
 the
 party
 circuit
 babble.
 Like
 you


go
 there
 and
 you
 talk
 about
 it
 like,
 "Oh


my
 god,
 it's
 so
 bad.
 It's
 so
 good."
 And


you
 miss
 the
 basic
 fact
 that
 nothing


about
 the
 ownership
 changes
 the
 human


incentive
 to
 use
 a
 good
 product
 and
 to


disqualify
 a
 product.


>> Maybe
 I
 would
 take
 the
 other
 side
 of
 it.


There's
 still
 millions
 of
 people


watching
 this
 and
 it's
 pretty
 clear
 that


millions
 of
 people
 watch
 this
 show


because
 it's
 good.
 No,
 no.
 Ultimately,


people
 are
 people
 are
 going
 to
 be
 drawn


to
 great
 products.
 There's
 no
 doubt


about
 that.
 But
 consolidation
 of
 the


major
 news
 assets
 CBS
 and
 the
 influence


of
 Tik
 Tok
 and
 the
 influence
 of
 CNN
 is


undeniable.
 That
 is
 just
 undeniable.


>> Undeniable
 to
 undeniable
 for
 what?


>> Just
 reality.
 Reality
 Americans.
 No,
 not


my
 reality.
 You
 can
 try
 and
 insult
 me.


That's
 not
 the
 point
 here
 in
 one


company.


>> No,
 it's
 not
 my
 reality.
 That's
 not


where
 I
 get
 my
 news
 from.


>> Millions
 of
 people
 don't
 watch
 CBS
 and


CNN.
 It's
 not
 true.


>> Literally,
 it's
 4
 million
 people
 who


watch
 it.
 So
 yes,
 it
 is
 technically


millions.


>> If
 you're
 adding
 it
 all
 up
 over
 what,
 a


year,


>> dduplicated,
 like
 what
 is
 what
 is
 CNN's


most
 qualified,
 bestrun,
 most
 popular


show?


>> Okay.


>> Uh
 on
 the
 network
 or
 on
 the
 news?


>> I
 don't
 know
 cuz
 I
 don't
 have
 it.
 I


don't
 even
 have
 cable.


>> Yeah,
 I
 know.
 And
 you
 don't
 even
 pay
 for


you
 asked
 your
 friends
 to
 steal
 New
 York


Times
 articles.


>> Everybody
 will
 I
 am
 the
 lead.


>> You
 get
 the
 final
 word.
 Having
 lived


inside
 the
 beast,
 should
 Trump
 be


involved
 in
 these
 mergers
 and


acquisitions?
 Yes
 or
 no?
 Chuck
 or
 call?


>> Well,
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 stop
 him,
 so


it
 doesn't
 matter.
 What
 should
 we
 be


concerned
 about
 is
 not
 media
 monopoly


power.
 It's
 censorship
 of
 the
 tech


platforms.
 A
 return
 to
 that.
 That
 is


where
 you
 destroy
 creativity
 and


diversity
 of
 thought.
 put
 the
 entire


nation
 into
 the
 mental
 prison
 from
 which


it
 escaped
 last
 November.
 That's
 that
 is


the
 threat.
 Censoring
 YouTube
 x


Instagram
 and
 I
 I
 just
 think
 we
 should


be
 focused
 on
 that.


>> And
 what's
 your
 take
 on
 Barry
 Weiss


taking
 over
 CBS
 News?
 I'm
 not
 sure
 if


you've
 commented
 on
 me.


>> I
 mean,
 I'm
 kind
 of
 impressed.
 I
 mean,
 I


you
 know,
 it's
 easy
 to
 make
 fun
 of
 Barry


Weiss
 for
 being
 dumb
 or
 whatever,
 which


is
 fair,
 but
 it's


>> you
 have
 to
 sort
 of
 look
 at
 it
 in


reverse
 image
 and
 it's
 negative.
 It's


like
 with
 those
 talents
 you
 got
 where


you're
 amazing
 and
 I
 will
 say
 I
 agree


with
 that.
 I
 think
 that
 she's
 charming.


She's
 tireless,
 energetic.
 I
 don't
 know


that
 still
 matters.
 Like
 we
 we
 overvalue


IQ.
 Oh,
 a
 person's
 so
 smart,
 you
 know?


It
 actually
 doesn't
 matter.
 Like
 being


charming,
 meeting
 people,
 you
 know,


pushing
 an
 agenda
 tirelessly,
 like
 that


that
 really
 works.
 And
 in
 the
 end,
 the


prize
 she
 got
 is
 not
 worth
 having.
 Like


I
 how
 would
 you
 like
 to
 run
 CBS
 news


such
 as
 it
 is?
 No,
 for
 real.
 That's


torture.
 They
 couldn't
 pay
 you
 enough.


>> What
 would
 you
 do
 if
 you
 had
 CNN?
 They


put
 it
 in
 your
 laper
 and
 they
 say
 you're


forced
 to
 be
 CEO
 of
 it
 for
 the
 next
 10


years.
 What
 would
 you
 do?


>> Well,
 actually,
 I've
 had
 that


conversation.


>> Slightly
 more
 relevant.
 What
 would
 you


do
 if
 you
 ran
 my
 son's
 school
 newspaper?


Because
 it's
 about
 the
 same
 skill.


>> Oh,
 I'd
 get
 radical.


>> Actually,
 Tucker
 had
 an
 interesting


answer.


>> Any
 other
 good
 questions?


>> No,
 it's
 a
 great
 question.
 Tucker
 was


about
 to
 answer
 it.
 Thanks
 for
 stepping


on
 it,
 Jamai.


>> The
 CNN
 question.
 I
 mean,
 I
 spent
 almost


10
 years
 there,
 so
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 I'm


familiar
 with
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 have,
 you
 know,
 I
 actually
 had
 this


conversation
 with
 someone
 was
 like,
 "We


should
 buy
 CNN.
 You
 should
 run
 it."
 And


I
 So,
 I
 had
 caused
 to
 spend
 like
 an


evening
 thinking
 about
 it
 and
 no
 way.
 I


mean,
 what?
 First
 of
 all,
 I'm
 with


Chimath.
 Like,
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 New
 York


Times
 or
 Washington
 Post
 or
 New
 Yorker


subscription
 anymore
 after
 a
 lifetime
 of


having
 all
 three
 because
 they're
 totally


irrelevant.
 They
 mean
 nothing.
 They're


speaking
 to
 no
 one.
 And
 there's
 a
 kind


of
 musty.
 It's
 like
 going
 back
 to
 your


childhood
 home
 and
 seeing
 that
 your


bedroom
 was
 really
 small
 and
 like
 the


paint
 was
 actually
 turquoise
 and
 all


these
 kind
 of
 sad
 posters
 from
 the
 '8s


are
 still
 there.
 It's
 depressing.
 Like
 I


would
 just
 shut
 it
 down
 and
 and
 build


something
 new.


>> Okay,
 shut
 it
 down.


>> Jason,
 can
 I
 give
 you
 my
 one
 thought


exercise
 about
 the
 New
 York
 Times?
 The


one
 thing
 that
 I
 think
 is
 worth
 talking


about
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 is
 I
 think
 they


will
 in
 the
 next
 five
 years
 do
 something


so
 egregious
 and
 over
 the
 line
 akin
 to


some
 sort
 of
 liel
 or
 some
 sort
 of


statement
 that
 has
 turned
 out
 to
 be


completely
 false,
 they
 will
 get
 sued.


And
 I
 hope
 when
 that
 settlement
 happens,


the
 person
 says,
 "I
 do
 not
 want
 to
 get


paid
 the
 $4
 billion.
 I
 want
 this
 to
 be


turned
 in
 into
 a
 nonprofit
 and
 into
 a


public
 trust."
 And
 then
 shuts
 it
 down.


Interesting.


That's
 kind
 of
 what
 happened
 with
 Fox


when
 they
 did
 their
 700
 $800
 million


settlement,
 the
 largest
 one.


>> But
 the
 next
 one,
 Jason,
 the
 next
 one


will
 go
 up.
 It
 won't
 be
 that
 scale


because
 you've
 had
 now
 that
 that


precedent.
 That's
 a
 very
 important


precedent
 about
 the
 scale
 of
 lying
 and


misrepresenting
 things.
 And
 it
 only
 goes


up
 from
 here.
 This
 is
 a
 one-way
 ratchet.


>> Yeah,
 you
 couldn't
 be
 more
 wrong
 about


that.
 Uh
 it's
 definitely
 not
 going
 to


happen.
 They
 have
 controls
 in
 place,
 but


it's
 a
 nice
 fantasy.
 They're
 also


crushing
 it.
 By
 the
 way,
 when
 they
 moved


to
 subscriptions,
 they
 have
 12
 million


paid
 subscribers
 now.
 They
 are


objectively
 crushing
 it
 and
 figured
 it


out
 better
 than
 any
 other
 news


organization.
 Whether
 we
 agree
 or


disagree
 with,
 you
 know,
 their
 content


and
 the
 quality
 of
 it,
 they
 are
 the
 most


successful
 objectively
 here
 in
 America.


All right,
 speaking
 of
 successful
 in


taking
 over
 the
 dialogue,
 we
 got
 to
 talk


about
 Nick
 Fentes,
 who
 you
 just
 had
 on


your
 podcast,
 Tucker.
 You
 platformed


him.
 Being
 facitious
 here,
 you


platformed
 him.
 I
 I
 created
 him.


>> Basically,
 it's
 an
 interesting


discussion.
 For
 those
 of
 you
 who
 don't


know,
 Nick
 Fuentes
 and
 have
 been
 living


under
 a
 rock.
 He's
 a
 27year-old
 white


nationalist
 with
 a
 very
 popular
 show
 on


Rumble,
 about
 500,000
 subscribers,
 which


isn't
 actually
 that
 big
 when
 you
 think


about
 it.
 His
 followers
 call
 themselves


Gropers,
 and
 he's
 gained
 hundreds
 of


thousands
 over
 the
 past
 six
 months.
 He's


on
 quite
 a
 heater,
 and
 uh
 he's
 got
 a


bunch
 of
 controversial
 opinions.
 I'll


just
 give
 you
 the
 quotes.
 This
 is


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 my
 opinion
 on
 him.
 He


was
 asked
 by
 Piers
 Morgan
 if
 he


described
 himself
 as
 a
 racist.
 And
 he


said,
 "Totally,
 I
 think
 everybody,
 if


we're
 being
 honest,
 is
 racist.
 The
 only


people
 that
 aren't
 racist
 or
 pretend
 not


to
 be
 are
 white
 people
 to
 their


detriment
 on
 women."
 Piers
 asked
 Nick
 if


he
 was
 gay.
 Nick
 said,
 "No,
 but
 I
 will


say
 women
 are
 very
 difficult
 to
 be


around."
 Piers
 uh
 then
 asked,
 "And
 do


you
 think
 they
 should
 have
 the
 right
 to


vote?"
 Nick
 said,
 "I
 do
 not."
 Absolutely


not.
 On
 Israel,
 Fuentes
 is
 very
 critical


and
 what
 he
 calls
 organized
 jewelry
 in


America.
 So
 now
 you
 interviewed
 him.


Couple
 of
 different
 ways
 to
 take
 this,


but
 you
 did
 a
 good
 job
 of
 telling
 his


origin
 story.
 He
 was
 part
 of
 Prageru.


He's
 got
 this
 really
 activated
 base.
 Why


is
 he
 resonating
 at
 this
 moment
 in
 time?


And
 maybe
 you
 could
 explain
 to
 the


audience.
 MAGA
 versus
 America
 first,


America
 Only,
 which
 I
 think
 are
 part
 of


America
 First,
 but
 you
 you
 you
 tell
 us


because
 I
 think
 these
 are
 just
 terms


right
 now.
 They're
 not
 like
 political


parties
 or
 anything.


>> Well,
 there's
 a
 struggle
 over
 what
 those


terms
 mean.
 It's
 very
 ugly
 and
 probably


necessary
 because
 you
 need
 to
 define


terms.
 Like
 that's
 the
 first
 thing
 you


do,
 I
 would
 say,
 when
 you
 think
 through


what
 you
 should
 be
 doing
 with
 your
 life,


for
 example.
 So,
 um,
 as
 for
 Fuentes,
 his


origin
 story
 is
 a
 little
 more
 precise,


and
 I'll
 keep
 it
 short,
 but
 he
 tweeted


something
 as
 a
 freshman
 at
 BEu,
 critical


of,
 pretty
 mildly
 critical
 of
 the


Congress
 for
 doing
 the
 bidding
 of
 this


foreign
 country,
 Israel.
 And
 somehow
 Ben


Shapiro
 saw
 that
 and
 attacked
 him
 and


tried
 to
 get
 him
 kicked
 out
 of
 his


Republican
 club
 and
 made
 sure
 he
 didn't


get
 an
 internship
 with
 some
 conservative


organization.
 And
 I'm
 not
 attacking
 Ben


Shapiro,
 but
 that
 kind
 of
 tells
 you
 what


attempts
 to
 shut
 people
 down,
 to
 shut


conversations
 down
 result
 in.
 They
 don't


go
 away.
 They
 just
 fester
 in
 the


darkness
 and
 they
 can
 sometimes
 become


really
 ugly.
 So
 what
 Fuentes
 is,
 among


other
 Well,
 first of
 all,
 Fentes
 is


saying
 a
 lot
 of
 true
 things.
 That's
 why


he's
 popular.
 He's
 funny.
 Uh
 he's
 smart.


>> But


>> he's
 a
 good
 Yeah,


>> he's
 a
 great
 broadcaster.
 But
 Fuentes
 on


some
 macro
 level
 is


>> troubling
 because
 he
 his
 platform
 is
 an


expression
 of
 something
 that
 has
 kind
 of


taken
 over
 all
 political
 discourse
 which


is
 identity
 politics,
 tribalism.
 And
 I'm


just
 opposed
 to
 that.
 I
 period
 and


always
 will
 be.
 And
 I
 I
 just
 think
 that


we're
 governed
 by
 universal
 principles


or
 we're
 governed
 by
 the
 mafia.
 Those


are
 our
 choices.
 And
 so
 you
 you
 know
 our


principles
 have
 to
 apply
 to
 every
 human


being
 or
 certainly
 every
 American


citizen.
 Period.
 or
 they're
 not


principles.
 Um
 they're
 just
 a


justification
 uh
 for
 tyranny.
 So


Fuentes,
 you
 know,
 has
 a
 different
 kind


of
 identity
 politics,
 but
 there
 are
 all


kinds
 of
 different
 identity
 politics.
 We


we
 lived
 under
 it
 during
 the
 Biden


years.
 We've
 lived
 under
 it
 most
 of
 my


life
 actually
 in
 one
 form
 or
 another.


And
 so
 if
 anything,
 Fuentes
 reminds
 us


that
 we
 have
 to
 come
 up
 with
 some
 kind


of
 principle
 that
 every
 American
 can


ascribe
 to
 something
 called
 national


identity.
 That
 is
 not
 a
 dirty
 phrase.


that's
 actually
 necessary
 to
 keep
 the


country
 from
 disintegrating,
 comma,


which
 it
 is.
 So
 like
 what
 does
 every


American,
 all
 350
 million
 have
 in
 common


with
 every
 other?
 And
 that's
 the


conversation
 we
 need
 to
 have.
 And
 in
 its


absence,
 then
 we
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 people


popping
 up
 and
 being
 like,
 well,
 all


white
 people
 over
 here
 and
 all
 black


people
 or
 Jewish
 people
 or
 whatever.


That's
 not
 going
 to
 work.
 That
 will
 end


in
 violence.
 Everyone
 knows
 that.
 And
 so


now
 is
 probably
 a
 pretty
 good
 time
 to


figure
 out
 what
 we
 all
 have
 in
 common.
 I


didn't
 platform
 him.
 I
 in
 first
 of
 all


platform
 is
 not
 a
 verb
 and
 anyone
 who


says
 it
 is
 a
 verb
 is
 probably
 opposed
 to


my
 core
 interests
 I
 would
 say
 and
 bad


language.


>> Yeah.
 I
 interviewed
 him
 like
 interview


everybody
 you
 know
 and
 my
 general
 belief


is
 you
 should
 let
 people
 say
 what
 they


think
 and
 others
 can
 decide
 whether
 they


mean
 it
 or
 not
 whether
 they're
 being


false
 or
 sincere
 and
 and
 what
 they
 think


of
 what
 the
 person
 is
 saying.
 But
 that's


that's
 my
 job.
 I'm
 not
 ashamed
 of
 it


despite
 a
 lot
 of
 efforts
 to
 make
 me


ashamed
 of
 it.
 I
 do
 disagree
 with


Fuentes
 on
 the
 question
 of
 universal


principles.
 I
 think
 it's
 im
 well
 first


of
 all
 it's
 against
 my
 religion
 to
 hate


any
 group
 and
 I
 told
 him
 that.
 But
 I


didn't
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 posturing


designed
 to
 make
 me
 seem
 like
 you
 know


the
 good
 person.
 Peers
 unfortunately


fell
 into
 that
 trap
 as
 an
 older
 man
 you


know
 well
 isn't
 IT
 YOU
 ARE
 BAD
 and
 it's


like
 okay
 I
 don't
 even
 disagree
 with


some
 of
 that
 but
 you
 don't
 elevate


yourself.
 you
 look
 like
 an
 outofouch


buffoon.
 And
 that's
 exactly
 the
 trap


that
 was
 awaiting
 Piers
 Morgan.
 And
 if


you
 watch
 that
 interview
 and
 if
 you


watch
 the
 reaction
 to
 it,
 that
 did
 not


diminish
 Nick
 Fuentes
 in
 any
 way.
 It


enhanced
 Nick
 Fuentes.
 What
 diminishes


Nick
 Fuentes
 is
 asking
 him


straightforward
 questions,
 particularly


about
 women.
 Not
 have
 you
 had
 sex
 with


anybody,
 but
 like
 why
 are
 you
 so
 mad
 at


women?
 And
 that,
 you
 know,
 letting


people
 talk
 a
 lot
 reveals
 who
 they
 are.


That's
 just
 true.
 Sorry.
 If
 you
 were
 to


give
 the
 top
 two
 or
 three
 reasons
 why


he's
 resonating
 with
 it
 seems
 like
 young


men
 and
 this
 America
 this
 burgeoning


American
 first
 movement
 which
 I
 guess
 it


would
 be
 good
 for
 you
 to
 define
 right


now
 as
 best
 you
 can
 recognizing
 you're


not
 the
 leader
 of
 it
 but
 you
 have
 said
 I


think
 uh
 you
 this
 uh
 concept
 is
 you
 know


uh
 resonates
 with
 you
 so
 maybe
 why
 talk


why
 is
 Fentes
 resonating
 and
 what
 is


America
 first
 versus
 MAGA.
 Like
 explain


that


>> just
 in
 in
 reverse
 order.
 I
 mean,
 I


would
 argue
 that
 the
 the
 premise
 of
 MAGA


is
 America
 first,
 but
 I
 wouldn't
 say


that
 America
 first
 is
 a
 movement.
 I


would
 say
 it's
 the
 only
 legitimate


reason
 to
 run
 a
 government.
 And
 it's


very
 simple.
 The
 the
 government
 of
 your


democratic
 republic
 ought
 to
 act
 in


broad
 terms
 on
 behalf
 of
 its
 own


citizens.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 not
 more


complicated
 than
 that.
 There's
 nothing


sinister
 about
 it.
 In
 fact,
 anything


other
 than
 that
 is
 sinister
 because
 it's


illegitimate.
 For
 what
 other
 reason


would
 you
 run
 a
 a
 Democratic
 Republic


and


>> treasonous?


>> There
 there
 isn't
 one
 actually.
 So
 of


course
 this
 has
 to
 be
 an
 America.
 You


could
 think
 of
 a
 new
 name
 for
 it
 if
 that


name
 makes
 you
 uncomfortable.
 But
 the


idea
 has
 to
 be
 the
 reason
 we
 have
 a


government
 or
 else
 we
 have
 to
 get
 rid
 of


the
 government
 because
 there's
 no
 other


justification
 for
 having
 a
 government.


Okay.
 So
 a
 b
 why
 is
 he
 popular?
 Because


he
 says
 that.
 But
 I
 would
 say
 more


broadly
 because
 he's
 defiant.
 There's
 a


kind
 of
 up
 yours,
 buddy.
 I
 can't
 say


that.
 Okay,
 watch
 this.
 I
 will.
 He's


hilarious.


He
 seems
 steadfast
 and
 strong.
 I
 I
 don't


think
 he
 is.
 He's
 not
 even
 married.
 So,


like,
 if
 you're
 afraid
 of
 girls,
 I
 think


you're
 a
 wuss.
 That's
 my
 personal
 view.


But
 there
 is
 a
 But
 in
 his
 defiance,


people
 see
 something
 really
 appealing.


Why
 wouldn't
 they?
 You
 know,
 you
 know,


these
 are
 kids
 who've
 grown
 up
 in
 a


world
 of
 hectoring
 and
 telling
 them


they're
 bad
 because
 of
 how
 they
 were


born.
 And
 Nick
 Fuentes
 is
 just
 raising


the
 middle
 finger
 to
 the
 people
 saying


that
 and
 saying
 up
 yours.
 And
 who


wouldn't
 love
 that?
 Of
 course
 people


love
 that.


>> Second
 piece
 is
 of
 the
 America
 first
 is


America
 only.
 And
 I
 guess
 that
 means


>> I
 don't
 know
 what
 that
 means.
 That's
 it.


No,
 of
 course
 it's
 Look,
 we
 we
 work
 in


concert
 with
 others
 by
 definition.
 It's


a
 globalized
 economy.
 You
 know,
 maybe
 it


shouldn't
 be,
 but
 it
 is.
 But
 America


only
 that
 argument
 to
 the
 extent
 it's


not
 really
 an
 argument.
 That's
 like
 a


counter
 slogan
 designed
 to
 undercut
 the


main
 argument
 isn't
 doesn't
 really
 mean.


No
 one
 is
 arguing
 that.
 It's
 just
 saying


look
 the
 US
 government
 ought
 to
 act
 on


behalf
 of
 its
 own
 citizens.
 To
 which


people
 who
 don't
 believe
 that
 who
 are


embarrassed
 to
 explain
 why
 they
 don't


believe
 that
 because
 there's
 no


justification
 for
 not
 believing
 that
 are


like
 well
 you're
 you're
 America
 only.


No,
 the
 government
 should
 do
 that.
 Every


part
 of
 the
 government
 should
 have
 that


foremost
 in
 mind.
 How
 does
 this
 help
 the


people
 who
 pay
 for
 this
 in
 whose
 name


it's
 done?
 Like
 again,
 even
 calling
 it
 a


movement
 drives
 me
 bonkers
 because


compared
 to
 what?
 Some
 sort
 of
 creepy


secretive
 oligarchy,
 which
 we've
 had


most
 of
 my
 life.
 Like
 that's
 just
 bad.


There's
 no
 way
 to
 defend
 that.
 And
 we


can
 argue
 within
 the
 framework
 of


America
 first
 how
 to
 put
 America
 first.


That's
 a
 totally
 legitimate
 argument.


And
 there
 are
 all
 kinds
 of
 different


thoughts
 about
 that.
 But
 what
 the
 motive


should
 be,
 the
 goal
 should
 be,
 there's


no
 debate.
 It
 has
 to
 be
 for
 American


citizens
 primarily.
 If
 they're,
 you


know,
 ancillary
 beneficiaries,
 that's


great.
 Not
 against
 that
 at
 all.
 Let's


help
 everyone
 if
 we
 can.
 But
 the
 point


is
 to
 help
 the
 people
 who
 own
 the


country,
 the
 shareholders
 of
 the
 United


States
 who
 are
 American
 citizens.


There's
 no
 other
 point,
 is
 there?


Chamat,
 let
 me
 bring
 you
 in
 on
 this
 from


the
 angle
 of
 the
 America
 first
 movement,


America
 only
 movement
 as
 a
 reaction
 to


the
 first
 year
 of
 the
 Trump


administration
 feeling
 to
 many
 people
 in


the
 Republican
 party
 as
 benefiting
 maybe


tech
 oligarchs,
 billionaires,


uh,
 international
 issues
 more
 than
 the


working
 man.
 you
 have
 started
 to
 tweet
 a


little
 bit
 and
 become
 vocal
 about,
 hey,


maybe
 year
 two
 of
 the
 Trump


administration,
 we
 got
 to
 get
 refocused


on
 some
 of
 these
 things.
 Unpack
 that
 for


us
 in
 the
 audience.


>> Well,
 can
 I
 can
 I
 offer
 my
 feedback
 on


Fuentes
 first?


>> Of
 course.
 Yes.
 Go
 with
 Fuentes
 if
 you


like.


>> There's
 a
 couple
 points
 I
 want
 to
 make.


The
 first
 is
 that
 he
 is,
 as
 Tucker
 said,


charismatic.
 I
 think
 he's
 funny
 and
 I


think
 that
 he
 can
 animate
 around
 a
 lot


of
 touchy
 subjects
 and
 say
 things
 that


have
 shock
 value.
 And
 I
 think
 in
 that


what
 he
 is
 is
 actually
 like
 a
 modern


shock
 jock.
 He's
 like
 a
 younger
 Howard


Stern.
 He's
 the
 Howard
 Stern
 of
 this


era.
 the
 way
 that
 Howard
 Stern
 was
 in


that
 era
 unlistenable
 to
 so
 many
 people


because
 he
 would
 be
 kind
 of
 okay
 for
 80%


of
 the
 time
 and
 then
 go
 totally
 off
 the


rails
 and
 you
 think,
 man,
 this
 guy
 is


some
 combination
 of
 mean,
 nuts,
 crazy,


and
 then
 you
 throw
 out
 all
 these
 other


adjectives.
 So
 that's
 point
 number
 one.


Point
 number
 two
 is
 it
 is
 true
 that
 the


longer
 you
 allow
 him
 to
 speak
 actually


the
 more
 you
 understand
 what
 he
 thinks


and
 as
 a
 result
 the
 quality
 of
 the


product
 will
 dictate
 the
 scale
 of


adoption
 and
 now
 this
 is
 where
 I
 think


the
 media
 yet
 again
 has
 been
 very
 sloppy


and
 doesn't
 do
 their
 work
 which
 is
 and


Nick
 you
 can
 throw
 this
 up
 there's
 been


a
 lot
 of
 research
 on
 what
 has
 been


happening
 in
 the
 last
 few
 months
 and
 the


bottom
 line
 takeaway
 in
 the
 last
 few


months
 is
 that
 there
 is
 coordinated


effort
 of
 individual
 largely
 unverified


accounts
 in
 social
 media.
 They
 typically


emanate
 from
 India,
 Pakistan,
 Malaysia,


Indonesia,
 Nigeria.
 And
 there
 is
 a


coordinated
 amplification
 process
 that


is
 happening
 around
 this
 content.
 And
 in


this
 chart
 that
 you're
 seeing,
 it's
 just


a
 comparison
 of
 Nick
 in
 the
 first
 30


minutes
 to
 what
 people
 like
 Elon
 get
 in


the
 first
 30
 minutes
 of
 him
 posting.


Now,
 why
 that's
 so
 important
 is
 you


start
 to
 see
 this
 huge
 disparity
 where


even
 though
 you
 have
 the
 most
 viral


person
 and
 account
 in
 the
 world,
 i.e.


Elon
 Musk
 on
 X.
 What
 you
 see
 is
 him


completely
 crushing
 and
 dominating
 the


verality
 in
 the
 beginning
 of
 his
 content


creation
 versus
 anybody
 else's.
 And
 then


there's
 a
 bunch
 of
 other
 charts.
 Nick,


you
 can
 retweet
 a
 link
 to
 this.
 It


starts
 to
 show
 a
 pattern
 where
 there's
 a


coordinated
 effort
 to
 amplify.
 I
 think


that's
 why
 we're
 having
 the
 Nick
 Fuentes


moment
 at
 this
 point
 in
 time.
 The
 New


York
 Times
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 sees
 this


information,
 probably
 doesn't
 bother
 to


do
 the
 diligence,
 has
 a
 bunch
 of


positive
 mentions,
 starts
 to
 pump
 him
 up


as
 a


leader
 of
 some
 kind
 of
 nefarious,
 crazy,


scary
 rebellion.


>> Well,
 no,
 they
 want
 to
 mainstream
 him


>> and
 they
 want
 to
 try
 to
 mainstream
 him.


So,
 what
 you
 see
 is
 the
 New
 York
 Times


trying
 to
 mainstream
 this
 guy
 and
 make


him
 credible
 so
 as
 to
 paint
 the
 right
 as


a
 bunch
 of
 evil
 racist
 ideologues.
 I


think
 the
 producers
 at
 Piers
 Morgan


didn't
 understand
 this
 was
 happening.


And
 so
 when
 you
 put
 him
 on
 a
 20
 minute


soundbite
 shot,
 it
 feeds
 in
 to
 exactly


what
 makes
 him
 popular.
 The
 ability
 to


land
 these
 small
 sound
 bites.
 This
 is


why
 I
 think
 Tucker
 was
 much
 better


because
 again
 in
 multi-hour
 programming,


you
 can't
 hide.
 You
 see
 the
 full
 facet


of
 what
 the
 person
 is
 and
 you
 start
 to


understand
 that
 this
 is
 a
 very
 savvy


young
 media
 personality.
 Now,
 when
 you


strip
 away
 all
 of
 this
 amplification,


the
 product
 has
 to
 work
 for
 it
 to
 scale


and
 grow.
 There
 is
 no
 way
 that
 you're


going
 to
 manifest
 average
 normal
 men
 and


women
 spending
 their
 time
 to
 take
 these


views
 credibly
 unless
 it's
 good
 and


right.
 There
 will
 be
 a
 moment
 in
 time


where
 curiosity
 will
 cause
 you
 to
 say,


why
 is
 everybody
 talking
 about
 this?
 We


are
 firmly
 in
 that
 moment.
 But
 I
 think


that
 there
 is
 a
 large
 portion
 of
 what
 he


says
 which
 I
 don't
 know
 whether
 he


believes
 or
 not
 because
 I
 haven't
 spent


that
 much
 time
 but
 is
 meant
 to
 shock.


It's
 meant
 to
 catalyze
 and
 animate


people
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


sustainable
 because
 the
 views
 themselves


are
 repugnant.


>> So
 I
 think


>> and
 this
 is
 why
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 wants


to
 elevate
 him.
 Can
 you
 put
 it
 up
 there?


>> So
 there
 I
 am.
 I
 look
 amazing


guy
 in
 that
 picture.
 I
 look
 like
 a


slackjawed
 yokal
 and
 he
 looks
 like


>> rebel
 with
 a
 cause.
 Yeah,
 it's
 Jed


Clampid
 versus
 uh
 James
 Dean.


>> The
 the
 other
 thing
 I'll
 say
 is
 that
 Sax


and
 I
 are
 in
 a
 couple
 of
 these
 group


chats
 with
 some
 folks
 and
 some
 of
 the


chatter
 there
 is
 that
 who
 is
 paying
 for


and
 who
 is
 activating
 all
 of
 these
 bots


and
 fake
 accounts
 in
 all
 of
 these


developing
 world
 countries
 and
 why
 did


they
 pick
 him?
 Some
 of
 that
 conspiracy


basically
 points
 to
 a
 handful
 of
 nations


who
 would
 love
 to
 ferment
 that
 kind
 of


dissent
 and
 that
 kind
 of


>> yeah
 we
 don't
 have
 chaos
 and
 uprising.
 I


mean
 this
 has
 been
 clear
 for
 a
 long


time.


>> So
 I
 think
 it's
 very
 important
 from
 here


on
 out
 that
 if
 people
 are
 to
 listen
 to


him
 I
 think
 the
 longer
 form
 content


exposes
 what
 he
 really
 thinks
 so
 that


you
 can
 judge
 it
 for
 yourself.
 But
 I


would
 not
 discount
 the
 fact
 that
 this


moment
 is
 happening
 is
 not
 entirely


organic.
 There
 is
 a
 deep
 inorganic


effort
 to
 put
 this
 on
 the
 front
 page
 of


the
 news.
 And
 so
 it's
 up
 to
 traditional


media
 to
 decide
 whether
 they're
 going
 to


basically
 lift
 this
 guy
 up
 as
 some
 kind


of
 newfound
 hero
 or
 call
 it
 out
 for
 what


it
 is,
 which
 is
 lead
 in
 the
 articles


with
 this
 data,
 which
 is
 widely


available
 and
 easy
 to
 get.


>> Well,
 he
 literally
 explained
 this
 when


he
 was
 on
 Tucker's
 podcast.
 He
 was


originally
 in
 college
 part
 of
 this


Prageru
 kind
 of
 movement
 and
 he
 said
 he


was
 in
 a
 Facebook
 group
 which
 was
 the


Prager
 army
 and
 I've
 talked
 about
 this


before
 we've
 joked
 about
 it
 but
 there


are
 groups
 like
 the
 one
 you
 mentioned
 uh


that
 you're
 in
 this
 group
 I
 heard
 about


it
 a
 couple
 hundred
 right-wing
 folks
 of


note
 take
 it
 easy
 Jason


>> my
 invite
 didn't
 get
 got
 lost
 apparently


to
 it
 but
 uh
 yeah
 add
 me
 to
 that
 group


please
 but
 what
 happens
 in
 these
 groups


some
 of
 them
 are
 designed
 to
 make
 money


some
 of
 them
 designed
 to
 make
 impact
 In


fact,
 Andrew
 Tate
 had
 one
 where
 there


was
 an
 affiliate
 scheme
 put
 up
 uh
 for
 it


when
 Twitter
 started
 sharing
 revenue


with
 accounts
 and
 you
 start
 looking
 at


these
 like
 accounts
 that
 are
 anonymous


but
 get
 to
 massive
 scale.
 King
 Co
 the


Great


>> You're
 talking
 about
 the
 clip
 forming.


Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 they're
 regurgitating


stuff.
 They're
 doing
 it
 for
 the
 money


obviously.
 They're
 making
 10
 20
 grand
 a


month.
 It
 becomes
 a
 full-time
 job
 to
 do


that.
 But
 we've
 got
 the
 Russians,
 we've


got
 the
 Chinese,
 everybody
 in
 between


doing
 this
 kind
 of
 pumping.
 And
 then


there
 is
 the
 actual
 army.
 So
 he
 Nick


Fuentes
 has
 an
 army
 of
 young
 people
 who


do
 this
 and
 they're
 on
 VPNs
 and
 they


flood
 comments
 and
 what
 they
 do
 is
 they


share
 a
 clip.
 And
 you
 can
 experience


this
 in
 your
 own
 social
 media
 if
 you're


of
 note
 because
 you'll
 have
 10
 posts
 get


x
 number
 of
 replies
 and
 then
 all
 of
 a


sudden
 the
 11th
 gets
 10
 times
 that
 all


at
 the
 same
 time
 directly
 to
 it
 not
 from


your
 followers
 and
 that's
 when
 they
 get


shared
 on
 these
 group
 chats.
 By
 the
 way,


we
 should
 mention
 just
 tangentially


because
 I
 want
 to
 get
 Tucker's
 take
 on


this,
 but
 Australia
 just
 passed
 a
 law


that
 under
 16,
 you're
 now
 not
 allowed
 to


use
 social
 media.
 Instagram,
 Facebook,


Tik
 Tok,
 all
 banned
 until
 you
 turn
 16.


And
 in
 part,
 Jason,
 I
 think
 it's
 because


>> these
 coordinated
 miss
 and


disinformation
 or
 amplification


campaigns
 are
 on
 all
 kinds
 of


characters,
 not
 just
 Nick.
 They're


proliferating
 because
 to
 your
 point,
 the


economics
 creates
 an
 incentive
 if


nothing
 else.
 Then
 there's
 obviously
 the


state
 level
 sponsored
 chaos
 that
 it


tries
 to
 sew.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 only
 highle


bits
 that
 you
 can
 flip
 is
 to
 say
 under
 a


certain
 age,
 we're
 just
 going
 to


minimize
 how
 much
 of
 this
 content
 you


get
 exposed
 to
 because
 we
 don't
 know


what
 it
 is.
 Before
 we
 go
 there,
 can
 I


just
 say
 the
 one
 thing
 on
 America
 first,


America
 only,
 whatever
 these
 terms
 are.


I
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 they
 are.


>> America
 first,
 America
 only.


>> Okay.
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 they
 are.


These
 are
 slogans,
 anti-
 slogans.
 Here's


what
 I
 will
 say.
 I
 think
 it's
 very


important,
 and
 I
 speak
 as
 an
 immigrant.


I
 want
 to
 be
 American.
 I
 don't
 consider


myself
 Canadian
 American.
 I
 don't


consider
 myself
 Sri
 Lankan
 Canadian


American.
 I
 consider
 myself
 American.
 I


want
 to
 absorb
 and
 I
 want
 to
 reflect
 the


values
 of
 this
 country.
 I
 want
 to
 know


and
 be
 able
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 about
 the


constitution
 of
 this
 country.
 I
 want
 to


be
 able
 to
 celebrate
 the
 cultural


heritage
 of
 this
 country.
 That's
 part
 of


the
 compact
 that
 I
 think
 I'm
 making.
 And


I
 do
 think
 that's
 an
 important
 thing


that
 we
 have
 all
 lost
 where
 we
 have
 to


run
 around
 in
 all
 of
 our
 traditional


garb
 and
 it
 just
 loses
 that
 what
 makes


countries
 great
 is
 a
 shared
 set
 of


principles
 and
 values
 and
 we
 have
 to


find
 a
 way
 of
 doing
 that.
 When
 I


immigrated
 from
 Canada,
 what
 I
 will
 tell


you
 is
 Canada
 took
 the
 opposite
 view.
 We


used
 to
 call
 America
 a
 melting
 pot


pjoratively,
 even
 in
 textbooks,
 and
 the


textbooks
 would
 call
 Canada
 a
 toss


salad.
 And
 we
 would
 celebrate
 that
 that


form
 of
 multiculturalism
 was
 better.
 But


when
 you
 fast
 forward
 the
 clock
 20


years,
 all
 it
 did
 was
 create
 confusion.


For
 example,
 if
 you
 go
 to
 school
 in


Canada,
 there's
 like
 a
 bajillion


holidays.
 Every
 culture
 gets
 their
 day


off.
 Then
 all
 of
 a
 sudden,
 what
 happens?


The
 kids
 don't
 get
 educated
 because
 you


have
 to
 have
 every
 longtail
 country
 get


recognized
 in
 some
 way,
 shape,
 or
 form.


All
 of
 a
 sudden
 you
 lose
 this
 very


standard
 form
 of
 basic
 organization.


That's
 just
 but
 one
 example.
 You
 know


the
 forms
 are
 in
 50
 languages.
 All
 that


does
 is
 create
 chaos.
 It
 should
 have


been
 in
 English
 and
 French
 because
 those


are
 the
 two
 official
 languages
 of
 the


country.
 All
 of
 that
 indirection
 trying


to
 celebrate
 everybody's
 heritage


confuses
 and
 slows
 that
 country
 down.


And
 you
 can
 see
 it
 in
 the
 GDP.
 You
 can


see
 it
 in
 the
 FDI
 foreign
 direct


investment.
 You
 can
 see
 it.
 So
 the
 one


thing
 that
 we
 have
 to
 agree
 is
 that


there
 is
 an
 American
 culture
 and
 set
 of


values
 and
 we
 should
 not
 lose
 it
 and
 we


should
 ask
 the
 people
 that
 want
 to
 be


here
 to
 embrace
 it.
 We
 all
 embraced
 it.


Saxs
 embraced
 it.
 If
 you
 talk
 to
 Sax's


parents,
 they've
 embraced
 it.
 If
 you


talk
 to
 Freeberg,
 Freeberg's
 parents,
 we


all
 came
 from
 different
 countries,
 but


we
 are
 fundamentally
 American.
 Jake
 Cal,


I'm
 I
 wasn't
 sure,
 but
 were
 you


intimating
 that
 the
 party
 behind
 Nick


Fuentes's
 meteoric
 success
 is
 the


Russians?


>> No,
 no,
 I
 was
 just
 saying
 that
 there's


brigading
 going
 on.


>> Which
 foreign
 actor
 do
 you
 think
 it
 is?


>> I,
 you
 know,
 some
 of
 them
 just
 want
 to


create
 chaos.
 I
 put
 Russia
 in
 that.
 Just


creating
 division
 in
 America
 distracts


Americans.
 I
 think
 they
 like
 that.
 But
 I


there
 are
 three
 levels
 of
 this.
 There's


his
 army.
 Fuentes
 does
 have
 an
 army
 of


super
 fans
 who
 are
 disaffected
 young


men.
 And
 there's
 a
 reason
 why
 they're


disaffected.
 It's
 hard
 to
 get
 jobs.
 It's


impossible
 to
 get
 a
 home.
 Health
 care.


They've
 seen
 people,
 you
 know,
 go


bankrupt
 because
 of
 healthcare.
 If
 you


look
 at
 healthcare,
 homes,
 and


education,
 those
 are
 the
 three
 most


important
 things
 we
 have
 to
 fix
 in


America.
 That's
 why
 young
 people
 are


disaffected.
 And
 when
 you're
 disaffected


as
 a
 youth
 and
 somebody
 starts
 blaming


the
 Jews,
 the
 blacks,
 the
 Hispanics,
 the


border,
 this
 issue,
 that
 issue,
 it's


really
 appealing
 because
 then
 you
 don't


have
 to
 take
 any
 personal
 responsibility


for
 it.
 And
 it
 is
 in
 fact
 really
 hard
 to


own
 a
 home
 in
 most
 cities
 in
 America


unless
 you
 move
 to
 Texas
 or,
 you
 know,


Nashville,
 Florida,
 and
 then
 there's
 too


many
 homes
 and
 prices
 are
 going
 down.


and
 he's
 a
 kid
 and
 he
 says
 stupid
 stuff,


but
 he
 says
 he
 does
 tap
 into
 that


disaffectedness.


Where
 would
 you
 put
 it
 if
 you
 ranked
 it,


Tucker,
 since
 you
 are
 pretty
 plugged


into
 this?
 Is
 Fuentes's
 popularity
 based


on
 the
 Gropers
 and
 this
 like
 really


inside
 group
 of
 people
 who
 are


amplifying
 him,
 is
 it
 what
 he's
 saying


or
 is
 it
 like
 some
 foreign
 actors


promoting
 him?
 How
 would
 you
 handicap


his
 massive
 popularity?
 And
 then
 we'll


move
 on.
 All
 all
 three
 play
 a
 role
 I


would
 say
 and
 if
 you
 want
 to
 know
 who
 is


primarily
 responsible
 for
 amplifying
 him


consider
 who
 benefits.
 If
 you
 wanted
 to


discredit
 America
 first
 say
 a
 foreign


policy
 then
 you
 would
 put
 it
 in
 the


mouth
 of
 someone
 who
 is
 pro-
 Hitler.
 Of


course,
 anytime
 I
 hear
 someone
 endorsing


Hitler,
 I
 love
 Hitler.
 Then
 I'm
 like,
 h,


you
 know,
 the
 Fed
 alarm
 goes
 off
 or
 the


inorganic
 alarm
 goes
 off,
 right?
 Okay.
 A


B,
 he
 is
 the
 product
 of
 a
 system
 that


the
 rest
 of
 us
 tolerated
 and
 certain


among
 us
 created
 and
 we
 shouldn't
 be


surprised.
 You
 know,
 if
 you
 have


identity
 politics,
 at
 some
 point
 you're


going
 to
 get
 white
 identity
 politics.
 I


think
 I
 wrote
 a
 book
 about
 this
 almost


10
 years
 ago,
 which
 was
 totally
 ignored,


but
 that's
 inevitable.
 It's
 inevitable.


And
 so
 to
 fix
 it,
 it's
 not
 a
 matter
 of


censoring
 Nick
 Fuentes
 or
 anyone
 who


likes
 Nick
 Fuentes.
 It's
 a
 matter
 of


dracializing


our
 society
 and
 making
 it
 a
 fair
 society


where
 rewards
 or
 condemnation
 are
 not


given
 on
 the
 basis
 of
 your
 DNA.
 Like
 you


can't
 have
 that
 and
 hope
 to
 avoid
 a


Rwanda
 because
 it's
 just
 going
 to


happen.
 It's
 inevitable.
 Tribalism
 is


the
 threat
 to
 every
 society
 and
 I
 don't


know
 how
 we
 lost
 sight
 of
 that
 but
 we


did


>> you
 people
 are
 sort
 of
 saying
 he's
 a
 fed


he's
 accusing
 you
 of
 being
 a
 fed


>> you
 know
 I
 don't
 know
 the
 whole
 fed


conver
 I
 unfortunately
 so
 he
 it's
 such
 a


long
 story
 I
 won't
 even
 bore
 you
 with
 it


but
 he
 attacked
 my
 father
 at
 one
 point


so
 I
 got
 baited
 into
 it
 and
 and
 I
 called


him
 a
 fed
 um
 you
 know
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


know
 uh
 but
 I
 do
 know
 that
 there
 are
 and


I
 think
 that
 Fuentes
 is
 pime.
 Let
 me


just
 be
 clear.
 I
 think
 he's
 primarily


successful
 because
 of
 his
 talents
 and


because
 of
 the
 obvious
 truth
 behind
 some


of
 what
 he
 is
 saying.
 I
 just
 right
 the


government
 of
 this
 country
 or
 any


country
 should
 act
 on
 behalf
 of
 its
 own


citizens
 and
 ours
 doesn't.
 And
 that's
 an


outrage.
 So,
 okay,
 that's
 just
 true.
 But


the
 white
 identity
 politics
 part
 of
 it


once
 again
 is
 inevitable.
 Identity


politics
 will
 give
 birth
 to
 white


identity
 politics.
 Why
 wouldn't
 it?
 and


your
 e efforts
 to
 stamp
 it
 out
 will


never
 work
 because
 they're
 too


hypocritical.
 So
 the
 only
 way
 to
 fix


that
 if
 you
 don't
 like
 it
 is
 to


eliminate
 all
 identity
 politics,
 which


we
 should
 do
 tonight
 because
 it's
 the


road
 to
 disaster.
 That's
 it.
 I
 have an


AI
 question
 for
 Tucker.
 I'm
 increasingly


surprised
 by
 the
 number
 of
 people
 on
 the


right
 who
 I
 would
 describe
 as


ardent
 free
 market
 low
 regulation
 to
 no


regulation
 folks
 who


are
 very
 anti-
 AI
 and
 I'm
 just
 curious


where
 do
 you
 think
 that
 comes
 from
 and


what
 do
 you
 think


>> it
 comes
 from
 so
 far
 as
 I
 can
 tell
 the


perception
 that
 the
 risks
 outweigh
 the


benefits.
 So
 the
 risk
 would
 include,
 you


know,
 massive
 job
 loss,
 chaos
 where


nobody
 sort
 of
 knows
 if
 anything
 is
 real


and
 the
 fabric
 of
 reality
 itself
 begins


to
 tear.
 You
 know,
 of
 of
 course
 the


massive
 energy
 draw
 and
 the
 huge
 and


expensive
 infrastructure
 changes
 that


will
 require
 the
 disruption
 that
 will


inevitably
 cause.
 So
 like
 the
 downsides


are
 super
 obvious.
 Not
 even
 to
 mention


the
 potential
 this
 gets
 completely
 away


from
 us
 and
 eats
 us
 or
 something.
 Okay.


As
 weighed
 against
 the
 potential


benefits
 which
 are
 what
 and
 I
 I
 don't


doubt
 that
 there
 are
 some
 you
 know


coming
 to
 faster
 you
 know
 diagnostic


conclusions
 in
 medicine
 you
 know
 or


organizi
 you
 know
 getting
 rid
 of
 tedious


tasks
 that
 no
 one
 wants
 to
 do


elimination
 of
 clerical
 work
 etc.
 I


guess
 those
 are
 upsides,
 but
 I
 it's


disproportionate.
 The
 in
 the
 view
 of


most
 people,
 I
 think
 who
 aren't
 experts


in
 this,
 not
 daily
 involved
 in
 it,
 the


risks
 far
 outweigh
 not
 just
 the
 upsides,


but
 the
 announced
 upsides.
 So,
 typically


when
 we
 roll
 out
 a
 new
 product,
 we
 tell


the
 people
 we
 hope
 to
 buy
 it
 like,
 "This


is
 going
 to
 be
 amazing.
 It's
 going
 to


blow
 you
 away.
 Everything
 about
 your


life
 will
 be
 better
 once
 you
 get
 the


iPhone
 27
 or
 whatever."
 There's
 been


none
 of
 that
 with
 AI.
 Like,
 none.
 The


announcement
 has
 been,
 "Holy,
 this
 is


going
 to
 change
 everything.
 Stop."
 How


exactly?
 Well,
 it
 just
 is.
 I
 mean,
 I


don't
 know
 who's
 in
 charge
 of
 the


marketing
 for
 this.


>> Seriously,
 Sam
 Alman,
 Sam
 Alman,
 and


David
 Sachs,
 go


>> David.
 Uh,


>> wait,
 hold
 on.
 Can
 I
 just
 Can
 I
 just


follow
 up
 on
 this?


>> Okay,
 so
 Tucker,
 here's
 just
 a
 thought


exercise
 and
 just
 tell
 me
 how
 this


factors
 into
 that
 opinion,
 if
 it
 should


at
 all.
 So
 let's
 say
 in
 a
 world
 in
 10


years
 where
 you
 have
 these
 super


intelligent
 computers
 and
 systems
 and


models.
 Okay,


in
 my
 thinking
 what
 that
 does
 is
 it


reorders
 the
 geopolitics


of
 all
 countries
 in
 the
 world
 where


you're
 in
 one
 of
 three
 buckets.
 In


bucket
 number
 one,
 you're
 an
 exporter
 of


that
 intelligence.
 And
 I
 think
 right
 now


steady
 state
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 China
 and


America,
 right?
 China
 will
 have
 one


version
 of
 exported
 intelligence
 and
 we


will
 have
 one
 version
 of
 exported


intelligence.


Then
 there'll
 be
 these
 strategic
 partner


countries
 of
 which
 I
 suspect
 there's


less
 than
 10


who
 are
 the
 enablers,
 the
 facilitators.


They
 have
 specialized
 skills
 that
 wrap


either
 the
 Chinese
 version
 or
 the


American
 version
 with
 energy,
 with


money,
 with
 knowhow,
 etc.
 And
 then
 I


think
 there's
 everybody
 else.
 And
 it


almost
 creates
 this
 thing
 where
 if
 you


are
 an
 importer
 of
 intelligence
 in
 the


future,
 you
 theoretically
 are
 at
 risk
 of


becoming
 essentially
 a
 vassal
 state.
 And


so
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it
 at
 that
 level,


isn't
 AI
 something
 that
 is
 almost


existential
 that
 we
 must
 win?


>> I
 mean,
 for
 sure.
 I
 mean,
 at
 at
 that


level,
 for
 sure.
 And
 I
 would
 just
 point


out
 that
 like
 almost
 every
 single
 state


in
 the
 world
 is
 already
 a
 vassal
 state.


So
 like
 no
 change
 there.
 But
 uh
 yeah,
 I


mean,
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 the
 wrong


side
 of
 it.
 That's
 clear.
 Is
 it


containable
 to
 nation
 states?
 That's
 not


clear
 to
 be
 honest
 to
 me
 at
 all.
 But


whatever
 I
 get
 the
 argument.
 I'm
 just


saying
 at
 the
 consumer
 level,
 no
 one
 has


explained
 why
 we
 should
 be
 excited
 about


this.
 And
 if
 I,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 a
 gold


buyer
 and
 ammo
 buyer
 and
 freeze-dried


food
 buyers
 already
 told
 you.
 So
 it


doesn't
 kind
 of
 affect
 me
 as
 an


investment
 matter,
 but
 like
 just
 I
 I


think
 it
 would
 be
 so
 I
 I
 don't
 have
 a


>> You're
 saying
 the
 dividend
 of
 AI
 is
 not


clear.
 Like
 it's
 like
 the
 positive


>> to
 the
 average
 person
 to
 the
 average


person.


>> You
 are
 100%
 correct,
 Tucker,
 on
 this.


We
 have
 done
 a
 terrible
 job
 as
 an


industry
 communicating.


>> What's
 the
 answer?
 What's
 the
 answer?


Like
 how
 is
 this
 great
 for
 the
 answer?


>> It
 it'll
 wind
 up
 being
 great
 for
 you


because


>> the
 prices
 of
 goods
 and
 services
 will


get
 much
 lower.
 You'll
 live
 much
 longer.


And
 listen,
 I'm
 not
 saying
 this
 is
 mine,


but
 this
 is
 what
 the
 industry
 should
 be


saying.
 The
 price
 of
 education
 is
 going


to
 go
 down
 80
 or
 90%.
 You're
 going
 to


have
 customized,
 adaptable
 education


versus,
 you
 know,
 paying
 for
 $50,000
 a


year
 degrees.
 You're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


learn
 anything
 in
 half
 the
 time
 at
 90%


less.
 All
 of
 these
 deliveries
 coming
 to


your
 home
 are
 going
 to
 be
 delivered
 at


half
 the
 price,
 twice
 as
 fast,
 because


it's
 going
 to
 be
 in
 a
 drone
 or
 it's


going to
 be
 in
 a
 self-driving
 car.
 And


we're
 going
 to
 make
 breakthroughs
 in


health
 care
 that
 will
 reduce
 suffering.


And
 you
 will
 not
 die
 of
 cancer.
 You're


going
 to
 live
 to
 120.
 We
 will
 have
 job


displacement,
 but
 we
 believe
 the
 lower


cost
 of
 living
 and
 the
 greater
 services


that
 are
 going
 to
 be
 available
 to
 you
 in


healthcare
 and
 education
 will
 make
 up


for
 that.
 And
 if
 it
 doesn't,
 we're
 going


to
 put
 in
 ways
 to
 pace
 out
 the
 job


displacement.
 In
 China,
 they're
 doing


this.
 In
 China,
 they're
 proposing
 and


Sax
 and
 President
 Trump,
 the
 amazing


President
 Trump,
 will
 be
 doing
 an
 AI


national
 edict
 soon,
 I
 believe,
 or
 an


executive
 order.
 But
 in
 China,
 in
 Wuhan,


paradoxically,
 they
 are
 talking
 about


giving
 out
 licenses
 to
 self-driving
 cars


in
 a
 paced
 roll
 out
 so
 that
 young
 men


don't
 lose
 their
 jobs
 on
 mass,
 which
 is


what
 we're
 about
 to
 see
 in
 America.
 And


if
 we
 don't
 take
 this
 into
 account,
 and


the
 great
 Zara
 will
 speak
 in
 a
 moment,


that's
 when
 this
 will
 become,
 I
 think,


the
 worst
 nightmare
 that
 you're
 talking


about,
 the
 dystopian
 version
 of
 this.
 We


need
 to
 figure
 out
 healthcare,
 homes,


and
 education
 and
 make
 those
 free,
 close


to
 free,
 and
 do
 a
 Manhattan
 project
 on


creating
 10
 new
 cities
 with
 10
 million


new
 homes
 and
 free
 healthcare
 for


everybody
 and
 free
 education
 for
 trade


schools,
 etc.
 That's
 what
 solves
 the


problem.
 That's
 what
 nobody's
 doing.


Sax,
 your
 chance
 to
 jump
 in
 here.


Well,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 going
 on


here,
 but
 I
 think
 one
 of
 them
 is
 that


humans
 are
 really
 attracted
 to
 either


utopian
 or
 dystopian
 narratives.
 I
 think


liberals
 are
 probably
 more
 attracted
 to


utopian
 narratives
 and
 conservatives
 are


attracted
 to
 dystopian
 ones.
 And
 I
 think


the
 future
 is
 going
 to
 be
 more
 in
 the


messy
 middle.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 going


to
 be
 to
 either
 one
 of
 those
 extremes.


And
 I
 agree
 that
 the
 industry
 has
 not


done
 a
 good
 job.
 They've
 created
 a
 lot


of
 fear.
 The
 whole
 AGI
 narrative
 didn't


help
 because
 you
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 in


the
 industry
 saying
 we're
 going
 to
 get


to
 AGI
 in
 two
 or
 three
 years.
 Those
 time


frames
 have
 all
 been
 pushed
 back
 by
 the


way


>> or
 eliminated.
 You
 don't
 even
 hear
 that


term
 or


>> eliminated.
 People
 were
 saying
 a
 few


years
 ago
 that
 we'd
 have
 AGI
 by
 now.
 Now


no
 one
 is
 saying
 that.
 They're
 basically


pushing


>> by
 just
 on
 that
 that
 was
 exactly
 a


function
 of
 the
 immaturity
 of
 our


industry.
 So
 to
 what
 Tucker
 said,
 it
 is


true.


>> Well,
 it's
 a
 utopian
 mindset,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> What
 they
 saw
 as
 utopian.
 I
 think a
 lot


of people
 reacted,
 wait
 a
 second,
 that


sounds
 pretty
 dystopian
 to
 me.
 And
 I


also
 think
 it's
 what
 needed
 to
 be
 said


in
 that
 moment
 to
 get
 that
 next
 quantum


of
 money.
 They
 were
 telling
 the


investors
 some
 version
 of
 what
 the


investors
 either
 didn't
 understand
 or


wanted
 to
 hear
 in
 order
 to
 get
 that
 next


scale
 up
 capital.
 But
 now
 that
 we're


past
 that
 and
 we're
 seeing
 more


practical
 implementations,


right
 now
 we're
 actually
 at
 the


beginning,
 I
 think,
 of
 the
 positive


productivity
 loop.
 And
 that
 isn't


explained
 because
 we've
 spent
 so
 much


time
 offering
 up
 this
 grand
 utopian


vision.
 it
 does
 seem
 like
 an
 overpromise


underdeliver
 kind
 of
 situation
 to
 show


up
 and
 say
 oh
 now
 your
 DMV
 form
 you


don't
 need
 to
 fill
 it
 out
 anymore
 and


people
 are
 like
 wait
 a
 minute
 that's


what
 we
 spent
 all
 this
 money
 on
 and
 I


think
 that
 we
 should
 have
 taken
 a
 much


more
 conservative
 view
 in
 explaining


what
 the
 upside
 was
 in
 the
 past


perfectly
 said
 Chimoth
 and
 I
 think


Tucker
 one
 way
 to
 frame
 it
 is
 the


abundance
 of
 Star
 Trek
 versus
 you
 know


to
 Sax's
 point
 the
 dystopian
 nature
 of


Terminator
 2
 one
 of
 the
 great
 paradoxes


here
 we
 we
 will
 have
 mass
 massive
 job


displacement,
 destruction,
 whatever
 term


you
 you
 prefer
 in
 entry-
 level
 jobs


already
 happening
 in,
 you
 know,
 what


I'll
 call
 chores
 like
 dishes
 and
 driving


cars.
 Entrylevel
 jobs.
 Those
 are
 going


away.
 And
 they're
 going to
 go
 away
 in


the
 millions.
 And
 they're
 going
 to
 go


away
 in
 the
 millions
 in
 the
 short
 to


midterm.
 2,
 three,
 four,
 five
 years.


You're
 going to
 have
 people
 protesting


in
 the
 streets
 over
 this
 issue.
 I
 don't


know
 you
 agree
 with
 it.
 You
 say
 it
 every


time.
 You
 interrupt
 me
 every
 time
 I
 say


it.
 But
 I
 will
 be
 right
 on
 this
 one.
 You


will
 be
 wrong
 because
 you'll
 see
 taxi


drivers
 are
 going
 to
 be
 the
 first
 group


to
 do
 it.
 And
 it's
 already
 happening
 in


different
 places
 in
 the
 world
 as
 I


mentioned
 in
 China
 and
 it's
 already


starting
 to
 happen
 in
 places
 like
 San


Francisco
 where
 they're
 burning
 the


whimos
 and
 with
 them
 for
 a
 reason.
 The


abundance
 argument
 is
 something
 we
 need


to
 get
 on
 and
 we
 need
 to
 get
 on
 it
 quick


or
 we
 need
 to
 get
 on
 some
 sort
 of


promises
 about
 re-education
 and


retraining.
 And
 you
 don't
 hear
 rich


people
 and
 these
 rich
 companies
 talking


about
 that
 half
 as
 much
 as
 they
 did.
 But


you
 know what
 could
 be
 the
 great


paradox,
 Tucker,
 is
 that
 the
 America


First
 movement
 is
 acutely
 aware
 of
 this


and
 shutting
 the
 border
 and
 deporting


people,
 which
 I'm
 fine
 with
 deporting


criminals.
 That
 actually
 might
 be
 the


solution
 to
 the
 problem.
 As
 we
 deport


people,
 as
 we
 don't
 let
 people
 in,


unemployment
 might
 stay
 at
 a
 low
 enough


level
 that
 we
 could
 manage
 giving
 the


dishwasher
 jobs,
 the
 nanny
 jobs,
 the


ones
 that
 maybe
 were
 being
 done
 by


illegals,
 construction
 jobs,
 and
 we're


just
 going
 to
 have
 to
 pay
 more
 for


those.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 $30,
 $40
 an
 hour


jobs.
 So,
 America
 First
 might
 actually


be
 the
 solution
 to
 this
 displacement.


>> May
 I
 just
 say
 one
 thing?
 I
 first
 of


all,
 it
 makes
 me
 uncomfortable
 to
 hear


you
 use
 the
 term
 re-education.


>> Yeah.
 Sorry,
 I
 don't
 want
 that.


>> But
 um
 you
 know
 the
 the the
 awesome


power
 that
 AI
 gives


governments
 and
 other
 concentrations
 of


power
 over
 the
 population
 as
 a
 concern


particularly
 in
 the
 United
 States
 where


we
 have
 a
 bill
 of
 rights.
 And
 it
 seems


to
 me
 it
 would
 be
 important
 and
 I
 never


hear
 it
 raised
 to
 put
 in
 some
 guard


rails
 to
 protect
 the
 average
 powerless


person
 against
 surveillance
 or
 having


his
 rights
 taken
 away
 in
 effect
 famously


social
 credit.
 It's
 just
 too
 easy
 to


extract
 compliance
 from
 people
 with


technology
 this
 powerful.
 And
 of
 course,


the
 very
 obvious
 next
 10
 years
 looks


like
 this.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 disruption


because
 of
 the
 elimination
 of
 jobs,


particularly
 low-end
 jobs,
 but
 not
 only


low-end
 jobs
 like
 lawyers
 and
 stuff,
 the


the
 true
 revolutionaries
 in
 any
 society.


and
 then
 the
 technology
 itself
 is
 used


to
 keep
 the
 population
 under
 control


through
 repression.
 Like
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 a
 crazy
 scenario
 at
 all.


>> You're
 aware
 that
 is
 the
 big


>> what
 are
 we
 doing
 about
 that?


>> Let
 me
 speak
 to
 this.
 So
 first
 of
 all
 I


agree
 that
 that
 is
 the
 biggest
 risk
 of


AI
 is
 let's
 call
 it
 the
 Orwellian


concerns
 as
 opposed
 to
 like
 the
 James


Cameron
 Terminator
 concerns.
 Just
 as
 an


aside,
 I
 I
 agree
 actually
 with
 the
 Star


Trek
 analogy
 that
 I
 think
 the
 right
 way


to
 think
 about
 AI,
 it's
 like
 the
 ship's


computer
 in
 Star
 Trek
 where
 you
 can
 tell


it
 what
 to
 do.
 It
 understands
 language


and
 it
 can
 speak
 back
 to
 you,
 but
 it


doesn't
 have
 a
 mind
 of
 its
 own.
 But
 that


doesn't
 mean
 that
 it
 couldn't
 be
 used
 by


humans
 or
 governments
 in
 a
 oppressive


way.
 And
 that's
 I
 think
 the
 biggest
 risk


of
 it.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 track
 that
 we


were
 on
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 Biden


administration
 is
 that
 they
 were


starting
 to
 require
 that
 DEI
 be


programmed
 into
 AI.
 And
 that
 should
 be


seen
 as
 an
 attempt
 to
 kind
 of
 infiltrate


AI
 with
 ideology
 that
 then
 programs
 or


brainwashes
 our
 kids
 and
 everyone
 who


uses
 AI.
 And
 we
 were
 seeing
 that
 when


Google
 rolled
 out
 their
 first
 product,


you
 had
 the
 whole
 black
 George


Washington
 thing
 and
 black
 Nazis
 and
 all


that
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 history
 was
 being


rewritten
 in
 real
 time
 by
 AI
 in
 order
 to


serve
 a
 political
 agenda.
 And
 that


didn't
 happen
 by
 accident.
 It's
 because


the
 values,
 the
 ideology
 was
 being


programmed
 in.


Now,
 I
 think
 that
 that
 was
 the
 track
 we


were
 on
 before
 President
 Trump
 got


elected.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a
 pretty
 scary


track.
 And
 let
 me
 say
 one
 other
 thing
 is


that
 that
 whole
 apparatus
 of
 so-called


trust
 and
 safety
 from
 social
 networking


which
 is
 basically
 a
 big
 excuse
 for


censorship
 and
 shadow
 banning
 all
 of


that
 was
 in
 the
 process
 of
 being
 ported


over
 to
 these
 AI
 companies.
 And
 in
 fact


they
 even
 use
 some
 of
 this
 same


terminology
 about
 like
 safety
 is
 really


this
 like
 catchall
 term
 for
 a
 lot
 of


things
 in
 the
 social
 networking
 context


when
 they
 talked
 about
 safety.
 The
 idea


was
 that
 users
 be
 confronted
 with
 ideas


they
 didn't
 like
 and
 therefore
 that
 was


a
 threat
 to
 their
 well-being.
 So


therefore
 we
 need
 a
 safety
 team
 to


censor
 those
 opinions.


>> Safe
 space.


>> Yes.
 And
 I
 think
 I
 think
 in
 a
 similar


way
 like
 that
 whole
 safety
 apparatus
 was


in
 the
 process
 of
 being
 applied
 to
 AI


like
 we
 can't
 have
 users
 be
 confronted


with
 ideas


>> that
 they
 don't
 like.


>> Training
 data
 right
 Sax.
 I
 mean,
 if
 the


training
 data
 is
 a
 set
 of
 woke


ideologies
 and
 those
 are
 pervasive
 on


the
 open
 web,
 then
 as
 Elon
 pointed
 out


in
 like
 I
 think
 an
 early
 version
 of


Grock,
 it
 was
 like
 if
 I
 misgender


somebody
 that's
 not
 as
 that's
 worse
 than


>> No,
 no,
 that's
 right.
 The
 early
 versions


bomb
 going
 off.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 the
 earlier
 versions
 of
 the


model,
 you
 would
 ask
 it
 what
 is
 worse,


global
 thermonuclear
 war
 or
 misgendering


Caitlyn
 Jenner?
 And
 the
 model
 would
 say


misgendering.
 So,
 and
 look,
 that


ideology
 was
 coming
 from
 somewhere,


right?


>> War
 games.
 Yeah.
 So
 I
 think
 Tucker
 is


right
 that
 there
 is
 a
 real
 risk
 that
 AI


is
 used
 by
 future
 governments
 or
 the


deep
 state
 basically
 to
 surveil
 us
 to


censor
 us
 and
 even
 potentially
 to


brainwash
 us
 cuz
 it
 is
 really
 good
 for


that.
 It's
 not
 that
 I
 think
 the
 AI
 is


going
 to
 develop
 a
 mind
 of
 its
 own.
 I


don't
 think
 the
 technology
 is
 anywhere


close
 to
 that.
 But
 I
 do
 think
 that
 it


could
 be
 used
 by
 the
 government
 in
 a


much
 more
 invasive
 and
 intrusive
 way
 in


the
 manner
 that
 that
 the
 government
 was


the
 deep
 state
 was
 already
 trying
 to
 get


in
 bed
 with
 the
 social
 networks.


>> That's
 right.
 This
 is
 I
 think


>> Yeah.
 Go
 ahead.
 Go
 ahead.


>> This
 this
 is
 the
 absolute
 biggest
 risk.


Both
 of
 you
 guys
 nailed
 it
 on
 the
 head.


In
 the
 future
 when
 you
 have
 these
 really


powerful
 models,
 the
 reality
 is
 the


incentive
 for
 governments
 to
 try
 to


infiltrate
 the
 information
 cycle.
 They


will
 not
 be
 able
 to
 hold
 themselves


back.
 And
 then
 what
 comes
 with
 that
 is
 a


lack
 of
 privacy,
 a
 total
 loss
 of
 privacy


and
 then
 a
 push
 towards
 censorship.
 So


as
 these
 AIs
 become
 more
 powerful,
 we


have
 to
 marry
 it
 with
 a
 set
 of


technologies
 that
 can
 preserve
 privacy


and
 preserve
 access
 to
 monetary


resources.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 examples


today
 that
 we
 have,


there's
 nothing
 you
 can
 do
 today,


nothing
 online
 that
 is
 not
 tracked.
 Now,


we
 have
 sets
 of
 rules
 that
 say
 that


tracking
 can't
 be
 shared.
 I'll
 give
 you


an
 example.
 I
 decide
 to
 buy
 a
 very


sugary
 cereal.
 That
 is
 not
 shared
 with


my
 insurance
 company
 that
 underwrites
 my


health
 insurance.
 And
 there's
 all
 kinds


of
 laws
 that
 prevent
 that.
 But
 that's


just
 a
 flimsy
 law.
 That's
 a
 moment
 in


time
 that
 could
 change.
 If
 that
 decision


were
 to
 change,
 now
 my
 buying
 patterns


become
 subject
 to
 scrutiny.
 That
 could


also
 apply
 to
 how
 I
 consume
 information


on
 these
 networks.
 So
 we
 have
 to
 find
 a


way
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 can
 transact.


Right?
 The
 great
 thing
 about
 the
 US


dollar
 is
 when
 you
 get
 a
 dollar
 and
 you


put
 it
 in
 your
 pocket,
 the
 physical


dollar
 bill,
 it
 is
 completely
 funible.


Nobody
 knows
 what
 it
 was
 used
 for
 in
 the


past.
 Nobody
 can
 judge
 how
 you
 use
 it
 in


the
 present
 or
 in
 the
 future.
 And
 we


have
 to
 find
 a
 way
 to
 replicate
 a


version
 of
 that
 so
 that
 you
 can
 preserve


privacy
 and
 minimize
 censorship.
 Because


if
 you
 have
 to
 transact
 all
 day,
 every


day
 online
 for
 everything


and
 there's
 no
 way
 to
 shield
 some
 amount


of
 privacy,
 it's
 a
 very
 scary
 outcome.


>> One
 other
 point
 on
 this
 is
 I
 do
 think


that
 if
 you
 look
 at
 kind
 of
 who's


promoting
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 scary


narratives
 about
 AI,
 it
 is
 people
 on
 the


far
 left
 of
 the
 political
 spectrum.


Because
 when
 you
 create
 enough
 fear
 in
 a


population,
 the
 people
 cry
 out
 for


government
 to
 intervene
 and
 save
 them.


And
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a
 coincidence


that
 again
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 the
 voices


who
 are
 spreading
 this
 like
 doomer


ideology
 and
 saying
 that
 we
 need
 the
 AI


models
 to
 be
 reporting
 a
 lot
 more
 things


to
 the
 government
 which
 is
 a
 stepping


stone
 to
 surveillance


or
 previously
 they
 had
 said
 we
 need
 to


embed
 DEI
 in
 AI
 models
 or
 we
 need
 AI


models
 to
 prevent
 discrimination
 which


is
 kind
 of
 their
 back
 door
 for
 doing
 the


same
 thing.
 They're
 on
 the
 left
 of
 the


political
 spectrum.
 And
 I
 do
 kind
 of


worry
 that
 people
 on
 the
 right
 are


buying
 into
 this
 in
 a
 way
 that's


actually
 going
 to
 lead
 to
 a
 lot
 of


government
 intervention
 in
 a
 way
 that


actually
 could
 lead
 to
 the
 orient


outcomes
 that
 we're
 talking
 about.


>> Mhm.


>> I
 don't
 think
 that
 people
 on
 the
 right


who
 are
 concerned
 about
 civil
 liberties


should
 want
 the
 government
 to
 play
 this


super
 intrusive
 role
 in
 AI,
 if
 that


makes
 sense.


>> Of
 course
 it
 does.
 Of
 course
 it
 does.
 I


think
 you've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 people


suddenly
 in
 the
 United
 States
 who
 are


very
 sensitive
 about
 power
 and
 feel
 like


their
 own
 power
 has
 eroded
 so


dramatically
 almost
 down
 to
 nothing.


Their
 economic
 power,
 their
 political


power,
 the
 power
 of
 their
 vote,
 the


power
 of
 the
 dollar
 in
 their
 pocket
 like


have
 all
 been
 really
 reduced
 and
 all
 of


a
 sudden
 you
 have
 a
 technology
 that


promises
 to
 concentrate
 power
 still


further
 in
 the
 hands
 of
 people
 other


than
 them.


>> And
 so
 they're
 they're
 touchy
 about
 it.


I
 mean
 they're
 definitely
 just
 freaked


out
 in
 general.


>> I
 agree.


>> Right.
 So
 that's
 that's
 the
 backdrop.
 So


people
 who
 feel
 panics
 like
 that
 and
 I'm


I
 have
 power
 but
 I
 still
 I
 sympathize


with
 it
 and
 I
 feel
 it
 to
 some
 extent


>> there
 you
 know
 you're
 more
 open
 to
 to


dumer
 scenarios
 when
 you
 feel
 that
 way


and
 so
 it
 would
 be
 helpful.
 Yeah


>> just
 to
 reassure
 people
 you
 will
 be


protected
 and
 yes
 there
 is
 an
 upside
 for


you.
 Yeah,
 look,
 I
 I
 agree
 with
 that
 and


I
 I
 think
 there's
 actually
 a
 couple


other
 things
 that
 account
 for
 like
 the


visceral
 nature
 of
 the
 criticism
 because


I'm
 on
 the
 receiving
 end
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 it


right
 now,
 so
 I
 I
 see
 it.
 Um,
 so
 one
 of


them
 is
 when
 people
 hear
 AI,
 they
 think


that's
 not
 me.
 Like
 that
 doesn't
 include


me,
 right?
 So
 there's
 all
 these
 benefits


that
 are
 so
 supposedly
 being
 created,


but
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 participate
 in


that.
 In
 fact,
 I
 might
 even
 lose
 my
 job.


This
 is
 why
 I
 think
 it's
 like
 pretty


important
 to
 get
 out
 the
 message
 about


how
 the
 whole
 country
 potentially


benefits
 from
 this,
 not
 just
 a
 small


click
 in
 Silicon
 Valley.


>> Have
 you
 come
 up
 with
 examples
 of
 it,


Sax?
 Like
 how
 the
 country
 benefits
 from


it?


>> Well,
 sure.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 an
 article


that
 didn't
 we
 cover
 last
 week,
 the
 the


Wall
 Street
 Journal
 talking
 about
 how


construction
 workers
 have
 seen
 their


wages
 increase
 30%.
 Because
 of
 the
 data


center
 buildout,


>> I
 mean,
 we
 are
 seeing
 a
 huge


infrastructure
 boom
 throughout
 the


country
 on
 energy
 production
 and


construction
 that's
 related
 to
 this.
 And


so
 it's
 not
 just
 software
 where
 people


are
 benefiting.
 But
 the
 other
 thing
 I


think
 that's
 very
 visceral
 on
 the
 right


is
 that
 the
 hatred
 of
 big
 tech
 quite


frankly.
 I
 mean
 a
 lot
 of
 conservative


influencers
 were
 directly
 censored
 and


shadowbanned
 during
 this
 co
 period


especially
 where
 the
 big
 tech
 companies


you
 know
 in
 the
 b
 administration
 were


really
 coming
 down
 on
 them
 and
 censoring


them
 and
 there's
 still
 a
 lot
 of
 hatred


towards
 big
 tech.


I
 think
 some
 of
 that's
 even
 misplaced,


but
 there's
 been
 like
 almost
 like
 a


transference.
 Also,
 with
 social
 media,
 a


lot
 of
 people
 have
 concerns
 about
 what


social
 media
 is
 doing
 to
 kids,
 body


image
 concerns
 or


fear
 of
 online
 predators,
 all
 that
 kind


of
 stuff.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 an


analogous
 situation
 with
 AI
 chatbots


because
 you're
 not
 meeting
 people,


you're
 kind
 of
 doing
 research.
 It's
 like


a
 whole
 different
 activity.
 But
 I
 think


there's
 almost
 like
 a
 transference
 of


anger
 or
 anxiety
 or
 fear
 from
 what


happened
 over
 the
 last
 decade
 or
 two


with
 social
 media
 or
 with
 again
 like


these
 online
 platforms
 and
 that's
 being


transferred
 over
 to
 these
 new
 AI


platforms.
 Even
 though
 I
 don't
 think


they're
 precisely
 analogous
 and
 the


regulations
 should
 be
 looked
 at
 a
 little


bit
 differently.


>> Let
 me
 Jason
 give
 you
 some
 credit.
 I
 do


think
 you've
 put
 your
 finger
 on
 the


pulse
 of
 what
 the
 problem
 is.
 Whether
 we


call
 it
 a
 perception
 or
 a
 misperception,


the
 point
 is
 people
 are
 afraid
 for
 jobs


of
 their
 jobs.
 That
 I
 agree
 with
 you.
 I


think
 the
 data
 about
 what
 has
 happened


though
 is
 is
 pretty
 flimsy
 that
 it


actually
 has
 seen
 a
 bunch
 of
 job
 loss.


For
 example,
 when
 we
 got
 home
 from
 the


Christmas
 party,
 Sachs
 last
 night,
 I


turned
 on
 CNBC
 and
 it
 was
 Jim
 Kramer
 and


he
 was
 interviewing
 this
 wonderful
 guy


who
 I'd
 never
 heard
 speak
 before,
 but


he's
 the
 the
 founder
 and
 chairman
 of


Service
 Titan.
 And
 he
 had
 this
 very


elegant
 way
 of
 describing
 it,
 which
 is


AI
 will
 put
 the
 jobs
 that
 are
 purely


cognitive
 at
 risk.
 But
 when
 you
 marry


cognitive
 ability
 with
 physical


dexterity,
 those
 jobs
 are
 thriving.
 And


he
 talked
 about
 construction
 workers,


plumbers,
 electricians.
 In
 fact,
 this


week
 when
 I
 was
 in
 Abu
 Dhabi,
 we
 were


talking
 about
 the
 transformation
 of


power,
 right?
 and
 that
 these


electricians
 now
 get
 paid
 five
 six
 7


$800,000
 a
 year
 which
 by
 the
 way
 just


FYI
 is
 more
 than
 most
 engineers
 in


Silicon
 Valley.
 Okay,
 these
 guys
 are
 the


ones
 that
 are
 actually
 winning
 but
 the


stories
 are
 not
 told
 and
 then
 the


incentives
 aren't
 there.
 And
 so
 there's


a
 bunch
 of
 things
 that
 I
 think
 need
 to


happen
 to
 highlight
 where
 the
 success


stories
 are.
 They're
 not
 the
 obvious


places
 that
 one
 would
 think.
 It's
 not


just
 some
 engineer
 tickling
 the
 keyboard


making
 millions
 of
 dollars
 and
 putting


people
 out
 of
 work.
 That's
 not
 what's


happening.


But
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 story
 is
 told.
 And


so
 the
 palpable
 fear
 of
 job
 loss
 is


there.
 To
 your
 point,
 I
 do
 agree
 with


you,
 Jason.
 That
 is
 the
 overriding


narrative
 that
 we
 have
 to
 with
 data
 and


facts
 convince
 people
 of
 what
 is


actually
 happening.
 There
 is
 definitely


a
 narrative
 that's
 ahead
 of
 the
 job


loss.
 And
 the
 question
 is
 what
 pace
 will


it
 happen
 at?
 when
 people
 are
 seeing


young
 people
 having
 a
 hard
 time
 getting


jobs
 and
 you
 know
 for
 whatever
 reason


but
 I
 I
 I
 suspect
 it's
 AI
 when
 they
 see


firms
 like
 Amazon
 estimating
 estimating


in
 the
 future
 they're
 going
 to
 eliminate


these
 600,000
 jobs
 and
 that
 leaks
 and


that
 they're
 going
 to
 do
 a
 PR
 campaign


about
 it
 when
 you
 see
 drive-throughs


moving
 to
 AI
 and
 when
 you
 see
 a
 third
 of


rides
 in
 San
 Francisco
 and
 LA
 move
 to


Whimo
 without
 the
 driver
 in
 it
 it's


really
 hard
 to
 say
 it's
 not
 happening
 so


We're
 just
 on
 a
 different
 It's
 a
 matter


of
 what
 timeline
 it's
 happening
 on.
 You


can't
 have
 it
 both
 ways
 where,
 you
 know,


these
 companies
 are
 raising
 billions
 of


dollars
 and
 they're
 replacing
 jobs
 and


saying,
 "Hey,
 these
 jobs
 are
 going
 to
 be


10
 times
 more
 efficient
 or
 we're
 going


to
 replace
 your
 driver
 and
 we're
 going


to
 replace
 your
 cashier."
 I
 see
 that


>> as
 an
 early
 stage
 investor
 in
 founder


university.
 I
 see
 it
 every
 day.
 Company,


hold
 on,
 let
 me
 finish,
 please,


gentlemen.
 People
 are
 pitching
 me
 on


startups
 and
 they're
 getting
 funded
 for


these
 startups
 to
 specifically
 replace


roles
 and
 they're
 saying,
 "We
 want
 to


make
 the
 perfect
 sales
 development
 rep.


We
 want
 to
 make
 the
 perfect
 customer


support
 agent
 and
 enterprise
 customers


are
 agreeing
 with
 them
 and
 buying
 these


products
 and
 services
 specifically
 to


stop
 hiring
 and
 increasing
 their


headcount.
 I
 see
 it
 on
 the
 front
 lines.


It
 is
 definitely
 happening.
 The
 only


difference
 is
 timelines
 and
 can
 we


create
 enough
 jobs?
 This
 is
 why
 I
 think


we've
 done
 a
 bad
 job
 of
 explaining
 it.


We
 need
 to
 explain
 for
 every
 one
 of


those
 robo
 taxies
 that
 gets
 out
 there


and
 that
 job
 is
 gone.


>> How
 do
 we
 get
 that
 person
 another
 job?


Because
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 the
 job


as
 a
 cashier
 at
 Starbucks
 anymore
 cuz


that's
 going
 AI
 too.


>> Here's
 a
 very
 practical
 idea.
 Yesterday


I
 was
 at
 the
 Senate
 to
 just
 talk
 about


this.
 What
 is
 the
 idea?
 I
 think
 we
 have


to
 start
 looking
 very
 honestly
 at


stopping
 the
 federal
 underwriting
 of


student
 loans.
 Why?
 Because
 it
 would


allow
 the
 market
 to
 move
 very
 quickly
 to


your
 reality,
 Jason.
 Because
 we
 would
 go


beyond
 just
 funding
 somebody
 to
 become
 a


master
 electrician.
 I
 suspect
 that
 we


would
 pay
 people.
 Yes,
 I
 bet
 if
 you
 went


to
 Google,
 they
 would
 not
 only
 subsidize


you,
 they
 would
 probably
 pay
 you
 a


salary
 to
 get
 educated
 to
 do
 that
 job


because
 once
 you
 graduated
 and
 you
 could


work
 up
 the
 ranks
 and
 become
 a
 master


electrician,
 there
 is
 so
 much
 work
 that


for
 example
 Google
 needs,
 Amazon
 needs,


Microsoft
 needs.
 And
 so
 if
 you


eliminated
 the
 federal
 underwriting,
 we


don't
 have
 it
 for
 car
 insurance.
 We


don't
 have
 it
 for
 home
 mortgages.
 We


allow
 the
 free
 market
 to
 tell
 us
 this


home
 is
 more
 risky
 than
 that
 home


because
 it's
 near
 a
 fire
 area.
 This


person
 is
 a
 poorer
 driver
 than
 that


other
 person.
 We
 should
 allow
 the
 free


market
 to
 say
 go
 to
 this
 kind
 of
 a
 job


and
 you'll
 get
 paid
 so
 much,
 but
 go
 to


this
 other
 kind
 of
 a
 degree.
 It
 will


cost
 you
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 And
 let
 people


decide
 with
 more
 clarity.
 But
 that
 one


thing
 would
 allow
 us
 to
 reinforce
 what


the
 economic
 upside
 of
 AI
 is
 in
 a
 very


practical
 way
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 and
 it


would
 solve
 this
 student
 debt
 crisis


that
 we're
 in.


>> Sax,
 should
 there
 be
 a
 license
 fee
 or
 a


tax?
 This
 has
 been
 floated
 by
 people.


I'm
 not
 saying
 this
 is
 my
 position,


>> but
 should
 there
 be
 a
 tax
 on
 having
 a


robo
 taxi
 or
 a
 humanoid
 robot
 that
 is


then
 used
 to
 retrain
 actual
 humans?


Look,
 I
 I
 think
 first
 we
 just
 need
 to


start
 with
 some
 accurate
 facts
 here.
 And


we
 need
 to
 explain
 what's
 what's


happening.
 And
 part
 of
 that
 is
 debunking


some
 myths
 around
 this.
 Now,
 I
 remember


about
 a
 month
 ago
 there
 was
 a
 whole
 wave


of
 very
 scary
 headlines,
 including
 in
 a


publication
 I
 really
 like,
 the
 New
 York


Post.
 Nick,
 maybe
 you
 can
 put
 this
 on


the
 screen,
 claiming
 that
 AI
 was


wreaking
 havoc
 on
 US
 jobs.
 So,
 this
 was


a
 headline
 from
 the
 New
 York
 Post
 last


month
 based
 on
 the
 October


report
 from
 Challenger
 Gray,
 which


basically
 tabulates
 announced
 layoffs
 in


the
 economy.
 And
 we
 had
 a
 spike
 in


October
 and
 about
 20%
 of
 those
 were


attributed
 to
 AI.
 It
 wasn't
 even
 the


majority.
 It
 was
 actually
 a
 relatively


small
 number.
 It
 wasn't
 even
 the
 number


one
 reason.
 But
 based
 on
 this,
 you
 got
 a


wave
 of
 scare
 headlines
 that
 AI
 was


wreaking
 havoc
 on
 US
 jobs.
 Well,
 lo
 and


behold,
 the
 November
 challenger
 grade


report
 has
 come
 out
 and
 it
 makes
 clear


that
 October
 was
 an
 anomalous
 spike.
 The


number
 fell
 by
 53%
 and
 only
 about
 6,000


of
 the
 layoffs
 that
 were
 announced
 in


November
 in
 the
 entire
 country
 were


attributable
 to
 AI.
 This
 is
 only


layoffs,
 by
 the
 way.
 It
 doesn't
 include


job
 creations.
 Okay,
 so
 only
 6,000.
 And


if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 year
 to
 date
 in
 the


Challenger
 Gray
 report,
 AI
 has
 only


accounted
 for
 4.7%


of
 total
 layoffs.
 And
 that
 number
 is


self-reported
 by
 CEOs.
 So
 my
 guess
 is


it's
 inflated
 because
 if
 you're
 a
 CEO,


you'd
 rather
 blame
 AI
 for
 your
 company's


non-performance
 rather
 than
 yourself.
 So


4.7%
 is
 probably
 the
 high
 number.
 So


what
 we're
 actually
 seeing
 in
 the
 data


is
 a
 very
 small
 number
 of
 actual
 layoffs


related
 to
 AI
 and
 that
 was
 corroborated


by
 a
 new
 study
 by
 Yale
 Budget
 Lab
 which


looked
 at
 the
 first
 33
 months
 after
 the


release
 of
 Chat
 GPT
 and
 it
 said
 there
 is


no
 discernable
 disruption
 in
 the
 labor


market.
 Okay.
 So
 that's
 I
 think
 a
 really


important
 fact
 is
 regardless
 of
 what
 you


want
 to
 claim
 will
 happen
 in
 the
 future


job
 loss
 has
 not
 happened
 yet.
 not
 in


any
 meaningful
 numbers
 and
 in
 fact
 AI


has
 been
 responsible
 for
 about
 half
 of


GDP
 growth
 this
 year.
 So
 GDP
 growth
 is


about
 4%.
 That
 number
 would
 be
 at
 2%
 if


it
 weren't
 for
 AI.
 So
 within
 that
 is
 a


lot
 of
 job
 creation.
 You
 see
 that
 again


with
 construction
 workers.
 So
 it's
 just


not
 the
 case
 that
 AI
 is
 creating
 job


loss
 in
 any
 meaningful
 way
 right
 now.


And
 people
 do
 this
 Mott
 and
 Bailey
 thing


where
 they're
 like,
 well
 AI
 is
 creating


tons
 of
 disruption.
 It's
 wreaking
 havoc.


And
 then
 you
 point
 these
 facts
 out
 and


say,
 "No,
 no,
 I
 mean
 in
 the
 future
 it's


going
 to."
 But
 then
 they
 revert
 to,


"Well,
 no,
 it
 must
 be
 happening
 now,


right?
 The
 disruption
 is
 so
 profound."


So
 look,
 we
 can
 all
 argue
 about
 what's


going
 to
 happen
 in
 the
 future,
 but
 right


now
 it's
 not.
 And
 if
 you're
 going
 to


talk
 about
 the
 future,
 the
 time
 frames


matter
 a
 lot
 because
 obviously
 we've


always
 had
 technological
 change
 in
 the


economy
 and
 it
 does
 change
 people's
 job.


But
 if
 those
 changes
 are
 happening
 over


20
 or
 30
 years,
 that's
 very
 different


than
 the
 next
 5
 years.
 And
 I
 really


don't
 think
 you
 know
 how
 fast
 the


disruption
 is
 going
 to
 be
 and
 how
 much


time
 people
 are
 going to
 have
 to
 react


and
 for
 new
 jobs
 to
 be
 created.
 I'll


give
 you
 an
 example.
 Back
 in
 the
 90s,
 I


remember
 when
 they
 said
 that
 brick
 and


mortar
 was
 going
 completely
 out
 of


business.
 That
 was
 part
 of
 the
 reason


why
 we
 had
 the
 first
 do
 bubble
 in
 99
 was


that,
 hey,
 everything's
 going
 to
 the


internet.
 It's
 going
 to
 go
 pets.com


instead
 of
 Toys
 R Us
 and
 so
 forth
 and
 so


on.
 And
 people
 thought
 that
 bricks
 and


mortar
 was
 going
 to
 be
 out
 of
 business


within
 5
 years.
 Well,
 it's
 literally
 30


years
 later
 and
 bricks
 and
 mortar
 is


still
 a
 thing.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 not


blockbuster.


>> No,
 look,
 it
 hasn't
 been
 a
 great


business.
 I
 mean,
 like,
 Amazon
 has
 been


super
 successful
 and
 you
 know,
 you
 did


not
 want
 to
 own
 Toys
 R Us,
 but
 bricks


and
 mortar
 is
 still
 around.
 Walmart's


still
 around.
 The
 change
 is
 still


ongoing.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 what's
 most


likely
 going
 to
 happen
 here
 is
 this
 this


technology
 is
 going
 to
 create
 a


productivity
 boom.
 I
 don't
 think
 the


main
 thing
 it's
 going
 to
 do
 is
 cause
 job


loss.
 It's
 going
 to
 have
 lots
 of


different
 impact
 on
 our
 lives
 and
 we're


going
 to
 have
 time
 to
 adapt.
 I
 don't


think
 this
 is
 a
 two
 to
 three
 year
 time


frame
 thing.


>> This
 will
 be
 the
 debate
 of
 our


lifetimes.
 I
 predict


>> but
 look
 I
 mean
 if
 I'm
 wrong
 we'll
 find


out
 in
 the
 next
 5
 years.
 But
 what
 I
 just


really
 resist
 is
 this
 Mott
 and
 Bailey


thing
 where
 people
 are
 like
 this
 is


happening
 right
 now
 and
 then
 they
 no
 no


this
 is
 going
 to
 happen
 in
 the
 future.


Be
 clear.


>> I
 think
 you're
 wrong.
 But
 I
 think
 the


summary
 of
 this
 point
 is
 the
 following


which
 is
 the
 facts
 today
 don't
 bear
 out


the
 bear
 case.
 But
 the
 perception
 is


that
 people
 are
 afraid.
 And
 married
 with


that
 is
 that
 we
 as
 an
 industry
 and
 I


don't
 actually
 blame
 it
 on
 you
 because


you
 had
 to
 clean
 up
 all
 kinds
 of


craziness
 that
 the
 Biden
 era
 left.
 So
 I


think
 you've
 done
 a
 great
 job.
 But
 our


industry
 needs
 better
 spokesman.
 I
 mean,


we
 talked
 about
 this
 after
 our
 tech


dinner.
 There
 needs
 to
 be
 a
 way
 for
 a


handful
 of
 people
 who
 can
 really


represent
 the
 future
 in
 an
 articulate


way


>> that
 people
 believe.
 And
 I
 think
 we
 do


need
 to
 do
 that.
 We
 can't
 have
 the
 CEOs


of
 these
 companies


seem
 either
 sketchy
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 or


too
 focused
 on
 material
 consumption
 on


the
 other.
 It's
 just
 bad.
 It's
 a
 bad


look.


>> I
 agree
 with
 you.
 But
 think
 about
 the


two
 biggest
 narratives
 that
 created
 this


fear
 and
 resentment
 towards
 AI.
 I
 would


say
 it's
 the
 AGI
 narrative
 and
 the
 time


frames
 now
 are
 people
 are
 pushing
 them


back.
 Right.
 That
 was
 there's
 one


there's
 one
 called
 a
 famous
 project


called
 AI
 2027


where
 they
 were
 predicting
 AGI
 in
 2027


and
 now
 they've
 pushed
 their
 time
 frames


back
 into
 the
 2030s.
 Look,
 you
 know,


once
 your
 time
 frames
 are
 over
 10
 years,


we
 know
 from
 the
 tech
 industry
 then


>> you
 have
 no
 idea.
 You
 have
 no
 idea.
 But


it
 was
 that
 it
 was
 AGI
 and
 job
 loss
 and


and
 I
 would
 say
 current
 current
 profound


disruption
 and
 job
 loss.
 And
 both
 those


narratives
 I
 think
 have
 been
 debunked
 in


the
 last
 several
 months.


>> Final
 chart,
 Nick,
 you
 can
 pull
 it
 up


here.
 This
 is
 just
 Fred.
 Unemployment


rate
 16
 to
 24
 year olds.
 This
 is
 the
 one


I
 think
 you
 should
 watch.
 9%
 in
 January,


now
 10
 a.5%.
 I
 think
 this
 chart's
 going


right
 up
 to
 14%.
 Just
 my
 prediction
 and


I
 think
 it's
 because
 of
 AI.
 Tucker,
 I'll


give
 you
 the
 final
 thoughts
 on
 this
 and


then
 we're
 going
 to
 start
 everybody's


favorite
 game,
 Tucker
 in
 20
 where
 we
 do


a
 lightning
 round
 with
 Tucker
 Carlson.


Tucker
 in
 20
 coming
 up.
 Any
 final


thoughts
 on
 this?


>> Well,
 I
 was
 just
 thinking
 about
 the


consequence
 of
 I
 mean,
 having
 lived


through
 Y2K
 and
 Obama,
 Y2K
 we
 thought


was
 going
 to
 be
 a
 disaster.
 Obama
 people


thought
 was
 going
 to
 be
 great.
 Both,
 you


know,
 were
 the
 opposite
 of
 what
 we


imagined.


>> I
 don't
 know
 that
 it's
 possible
 to


predict
 the
 effects
 of
 this.
 But
 I
 guess


my
 one
 worry
 which
 I
 would
 just
 I
 I


think
 that
 people
 all
 people
 especially


men
 need
 to
 feel
 useful
 and
 the
 thing


that's
 offended
 me
 most
 about
 the
 about


the
 AI
 conversation
 is
 not
 the
 AGI
 stuff


which
 always
 seemed
 a
 little
 bit


fantastical
 to
 me.
 It's
 the
 it's
 UBI.


It's
 the
 idea
 you
 could
 just
 like
 pay


people
 to
 be
 content
 or
 something.
 And


having
 grown
 up
 both
 around
 inherited


money
 and
 welfare,
 you
 know,
 both
 are,


you
 know,
 two
 sides
 of
 the
 same
 coin.


People
 need
 to
 feel
 like
 they're


contributing
 and
 that
 their
 lives
 have


meaning.
 And
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 just
 hope
 I


hope
 people
 are
 thinking
 about
 that
 a


lot.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree
 with
 you.


>> By
 the
 way,
 that
 that
 whole
 UBI


narrative,
 I
 think
 Sam
 was
 like
 towning


that
 a
 couple
 years
 ago.


>> He
 funded
 it.
 He
 funded
 a
 study.


>> It
 made
 this
 whole
 thing
 so
 much
 worse


because
 again,
 it
 was
 playing
 into
 this


idea
 that
 everyone's
 going to
 be
 put
 out


of
 work
 and
 that's
 a
 good
 thing
 and


you'll
 just
 get
 welfare
 from
 the


government.
 And
 who
 would
 want
 that?
 You


know,
 it's
 not
 if
 that's
 not
 the
 side


you
 want.
 Now,
 I
 mean
 I
 mean
 where
 I


disagree
 with
 my
 friends
 on
 the
 right
 is


I
 just
 don't
 think
 that's
 what's
 gonna


happen.
 I
 mean,
 I
 could
 be
 wrong,
 but
 I


just
 don't
 think
 that's
 what's


happening.
 It
 hasn't
 happened
 yet.
 I


don't
 think
 that's
 what's
 going
 to


happen.
 But
 look,
 I
 agree
 with
 them


about
 the
 undesirability
 of
 that
 world


very
 much.


>> All
 right,
 Tucker
 and
 20,
 your
 thoughts


on
 You
 can
 take
 up
 to
 30
 seconds,
 but


Tucker
 and
 20
 sounds
 better.
 Tucker
 in


20.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 of
 Venezuela


uh
 these
 boats
 and
 then
 seizing
 the
 oil


tanker?
 Why
 are
 we
 doing
 this?
 Why
 are


we
 so
 active
 in
 Venezuela,
 Tucker?


>> No
 freaking
 idea.
 But
 I
 do
 know
 that
 if


it
 becomes
 a
 real
 war,
 people
 are
 going


to
 be
 shocked
 and
 it's
 the
 last
 thing


the
 country
 needs.


>> There's
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 number
 one


requirement
 of
 war
 is
 that
 you
 explain


to
 your
 population
 why
 you're
 doing
 it.


Even
 if
 you're
 lying
 about
 it.
 Even
 if


it's
 like,
 "Oh,
 they
 have
 weapons
 of


mass
 destruction.
 We'll
 find
 them
 once


we
 invade."


Everyone
 mocks
 that,
 but
 at least
 it
 was


like
 a
 real
 rationale
 that
 allowed
 the


country
 to
 unite
 behind
 the
 invasion.


That
 groundwork
 has
 not
 been
 laid.
 The


drug
 stuff,
 everyone's
 against
 drugs.


They're
 not
 coming
 from
 Venezuela


primarily,
 as
 we
 know.
 So,
 they're


coming
 from
 Mexico.
 I'm
 not
 advocating


for
 an
 invasion
 of
 Mexico.
 There
 may
 be


a
 good
 reason
 to
 have
 a
 war
 with


Venezuela,
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 it
 would
 be


now
 would
 be
 the
 time
 to
 roll
 it
 out
 if


in
 fact
 we
 are
 going
 to
 have
 one.
 My


sense
 is
 we're
 probably
 not.
 This
 is
 all


an
 effort
 to
 get
 Maduro
 to
 leave.
 I


don't
 think
 he's
 leaving.
 So,
 I
 hope
 we


can
 live
 with
 that.
 But
 I
 I
 just
 don't


think
 right
 now
 is
 the
 time
 for
 a
 ground


war
 in
 South
 America.


>> You've
 been
 very
 excited
 about
 the


potential
 of
 Qatar
 being
 a
 deeper
 ally


of
 the
 United
 States
 and
 you're
 buying
 a


place
 there.
 Uh
 why
 are
 you
 so
 why
 are


you
 soar


to
 mix?


>> I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 I
 mean
 of
 course
 anyone


who
 who
 travels
 to
 the
 Gulf
 can
 tell
 you


there's
 something
 amazing
 happening


there.
 And
 it's
 not
 just
 about
 money.


It's
 about
 openness,
 but
 I'm
 an


American.
 I'm
 not
 going
 anywhere.
 I
 have


one
 passport.
 I'm
 buying
 a
 house
 in


guitar.
 To
 make
 the
 simple
 point,
 I've


been
 attacked
 for
 being
 a
 tool
 of
 guitar


paid
 by
 guitar.
 I've
 never
 taken
 a


dollar
 from
 Qar
 or
 anyone
 else.
 I
 have


no
 investors
 and
 no
 debt.
 So,
 I'm
 not


into
 taking
 money
 from
 people,
 but
 I


wanted
 to
 turn
 it
 around
 and
 be
 a
 net


investor
 in
 Qar
 in
 order
 to
 take
 control


of
 Qatari
 propaganda
 in
 order
 to
 say,


"No,
 they
 haven't
 bought
 me.
 I've
 bought


them."
 and
 I'm
 texting
 them
 my
 talking


points
 and
 they're
 repeating
 them
 and


that's
 what
 I
 plan
 to
 say
 the
 second
 I


close
 on
 my
 house.


>> Uh
 Candace
 Owen,
 Charlie
 Kirk's


assassination,
 conspiracy
 theory.
 What's


your
 take?


>> I
 think
 it's
 important
 for
 I
 mean
 look,


in
 the
 end
 it's
 the
 job
 of
 federal
 law


enforcement
 to
 find
 out
 who
 did
 it
 and


then
 explain
 it
 to
 the
 public
 in
 a
 way


that
 makes
 sense
 and
 can
 be
 proven.
 And


I
 really
 hope
 that
 will
 happen
 soon.
 So


they're
 they're
 part
 like
 in
 any
 any
 I


mean
 I
 was
 a
 crime
 reporter.
 I
 wrote
 a


book
 on
 this.
 There's
 in
 any
 aftermath


of
 any
 crime,
 there
 are
 anomalies,
 weird


coincidences,
 things
 you
 can't
 fully


explain.
 I
 mean,
 the
 closer
 you
 look
 at


anything,
 the
 more
 complex
 it
 reveals


itself
 to
 be.
 So,
 that's
 certainly
 true


here.
 But
 because
 of
 the
 nature
 of
 this


murder
 of
 our
 friend,
 um,
 I
 think
 it's


all
 the
 more
 important
 to
 make
 sure
 the


public
 understands


who
 did
 this
 and
 and
 why.
 And
 I
 would


say
 the
 FBI
 doesn't
 have
 a
 lot
 of


credibility.
 It's
 not
 the
 fault
 of
 Cash


Patel
 and
 Dan
 Banchino.
 They
 inherited


an
 agency
 with
 basically
 no
 credibility


that's
 has
 a
 documented
 history
 of


manufacturing
 crime.
 So
 like
 it's
 not


enough
 to
 say
 the
 FBI
 says
 it.
 You
 have


to
 explain
 how.
 And
 I'm
 not
 even


doubting
 the
 the
 core
 case
 they're


making.
 But
 if
 they
 are
 telling
 me
 that


this
 was
 a
 lone
 gunman,
 that
 no
 one
 else


was
 implicated
 in
 this
 crime,
 I
 think


it's
 fair
 to
 ask
 like
 how
 did
 you
 reach


that
 conclusion?
 And
 did
 you
 look
 at


this
 that
 and
 the
 other
 thing?
 And
 I


don't
 think
 we
 should
 be
 intimidated
 out


of
 asking
 those
 questions.
 Those
 are
 not


unpatriotic
 questions.
 Those
 are


questions
 that
 I
 think
 uh
 you
 know


express
 our
 uh
 reverence
 for
 Charlie


Kirk.
 This
 is
 a
 way
 to
 honor
 him
 and
 any


American
 who's
 murdered.
 So


>> sorry.
 By
 the
 way,
 just
 on
 this
 if


anybody
 has
 not
 watched
 Tucker's


documentary


>> Yep.


>> about
 the
 Butler,
 Pennsylvania
 shooter,


I
 can't
 remember
 his
 name.


>> We're
 memorizing
 that
 anyway.
 So,
 please


don't
 ask
 any
 questions.


>> Yeah.
 What
 happened
 with
 that?
 Jeez.
 I


thought
 your
 documentary
 was
 pretty


kick-ass.
 Worth.


>> Well,
 thank
 you.
 And
 it
 just
 I
 mean
 it


look


>> it
 was
 really
 good.


>> We
 we
 asked
 obvious
 questions,
 couldn't


get
 straightforward
 answers.
 I
 do
 think


the
 more


>> you
 did
 more
 than
 this.
 I
 have
 to
 give


you
 credit
 because
 you
 were
 able
 to


scrub
 internet
 searches.
 You
 went
 back


to
 the
 way
 back
 machine.
 There
 was
 a


level
 of
 detail
 because
 my


interpretation
 was
 it
 seemed
 like
 you


guys
 were
 afraid
 of
 just
 getting
 sh
 on


from
 everybody.
 And
 so
 you
 went
 to
 the


point
 of
 making
 sure
 that
 this
 stuff
 was


irrefutable
 fact.
 And
 you
 had
 a
 level
 of


detail
 in
 there,
 which
 I
 hadn't
 seen
 in


an
 investigative
 research
 piece
 in
 a


long
 time.
 I
 do
 encourage
 people
 to


watch
 it.
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 very
 good.


>> Well,
 the
 good
 news
 about
 being


universally
 hated
 is
 it
 keeps
 your


standards
 higher
 um
 because
 you
 can't


afford,
 you
 know,
 to
 make
 too
 many


mistakes.
 No,
 but
 we
 can't
 have
 too


many,
 you
 know,
 high-profile
 murders
 or


attempted
 murders
 that
 don't
 have
 firm,


believable
 resolutions.
 The
 the
 the


social
 fabric
 can't
 handle
 that
 because


then
 people
 become
 totally
 postmodern
 in


their
 thinking
 and
 don't
 believe


anything.
 So,
 that's
 incumbent
 on


federal
 authorities
 to
 reassure
 us.


>> Tucker,
 if
 you
 are
 running
 the


Republican
 campaign
 going
 into
 the


midterms,
 what
 do
 you
 do
 the
 same?
 What


do
 you
 do
 more
 of
 and
 what
 do
 you
 do


less
 of?
 Well,
 I
 would,
 you
 know,
 I'
 I'd


focus
 on
 domestic
 economic
 issues
 to
 the


exclusion
 of
 everything
 else.
 I
 would


and
 um
 I
 would
 I
 think
 that's
 that's
 the


main
 concern.
 It's
 always
 the
 main


concern.
 Now,
 I'm
 entering
 into
 very


benal
 territory
 because
 I'm
 repeating


every
 uh
 you
 know
 obvious
 observation
 in


the
 past
 100
 years
 in
 American
 politics.


But
 people
 do
 care
 about
 that
 and
 they


are
 concerned.
 AI
 is
 part
 of
 that


probably
 not
 in
 its
 reality
 but
 in
 its


expectation
 and
 it's
 the
 fears
 that


people
 have
 about
 what's
 coming.
 Um,
 and


so
 I
 would
 I
 would
 try
 to
 address
 those


issues
 at
 least
 by
 explaining
 them.
 I
 do


think
 like
 well
 I'm
 in
 the
 explaining


business
 so
 I'm
 biased
 but
 80%
 of
 the


problem
 this
 is
 true
 in
 marriage
 and


child
 rearing
 and
 governing
 as
 well.
 You


need
 to
 explain
 what
 you're
 doing,


what's
 going
 to
 happen.
 I'm
 going
 to


give
 you
 the
 shot.
 Count
 backwards
 from


10.
 By
 seven
 you're
 going to
 be
 asleep.


When
 you
 wake
 up
 you'll
 be
 fixed.
 Like


that's
 what
 they
 tell
 you
 in
 surgery.


And
 they
 tell
 you
 that
 for
 a
 reason.


They
 don't
 just
 roll
 you
 into
 a
 dark


room
 and
 start
 injecting
 you
 with
 stuff.


They
 walk
 you
 through
 it.
 And
 that's


enormously
 reassuring.
 In
 fact,
 it's


critical.
 And
 so,
 we
 just
 need
 a
 lot


more
 of
 that
 from
 everyone
 and
 not
 just


government,
 but
 people
 with
 a
 platform


explaining
 what
 the
 hell
 is
 going
 on


because
 we're
 getting
 to
 a
 place
 where


trust
 is
 vanishingly
 rare
 and
 that's


bad.
 That
 creates
 volatility.
 After
 3


hours
 with
 Milo
 Yiannopoulos,


is
 homosexuality
 nature
 or
 nurture
 a


trauma
 response?
 And
 David
 Freeberg


wants
 to
 know,


>> why
 are
 you
 so
 gay?


>> Why
 are
 you
 gay?


>> Why
 are


>> Why
 are
 you
 gay?
 I
 just
 wanted
 to
 do
 an


interview
 where
 I
 could
 quote
 my


favorite
 uh
 Nigerian
 but
 um
 no
 I
 mean


well
 clearly
 it's
 not
 nature
 at
 least


primarily
 or
 we
 wouldn't
 be
 having
 an


absolute
 rise
 in
 it
 and
 there
 would
 be


some
 hint
 of
 a
 gene
 responsible
 for
 it.


I
 mean
 so
 many
 different
 um
 you
 know


genetic
 manifestations
 have
 been


isolated
 from
 the
 from
 the
 decoding
 of


the
 human
 genome
 and
 that
 we're
 not
 you


know
 so
 no
 clearly
 it
 is
 primarily
 um


nurture
 that's
 not
 an
 attack
 on
 anyone


doesn't
 make
 it
 any
 less
 real
 I'm
 not


saying
 it's
 fake
 of
 course
 it's
 the


opposite
 of
 fake
 it's
 very
 very
 real
 um


and
 it's
 not
 even
 a
 value
 judgment
 it's


just
 an
 observation
 I
 I
 think
 on
 the


question
 of
 sexuality
 and
 gender
 it's


best
 to
 depoliticize
 it.
 It's
 been
 so


politicized,
 you
 can't
 even
 have
 an


honest
 conversation
 about
 it
 or
 you
 get


attacked
 from
 all
 sides.
 That
 how
 does


that
 help
 anyone?
 It
 doesn't.
 And
 so,


it's
 best
 just
 to
 look
 at
 this
 as
 cooly


and
 as
 rationally
 as
 you
 can.
 Try
 to
 get


to
 the
 truth
 and
 then
 allow
 people
 to


make
 their
 own
 decisions
 about
 what
 to


do
 with
 it.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 my
 view
 of


everything
 really,
 but
 but
 it's
 time
 to


take
 that
 approach
 to
 sexuality.


>> Okay,
 final
 one.
 Should
 we
 be
 in
 NATO?


Should
 America
 pull
 out
 of
 NATO?


>> Of
 course,
 we
 shouldn't
 be
 in
 NATO.


What?
 That's
 not
 I
 thought
 these
 were


hard
 questions.
 Exactly.
 I
 give
 you


sometimes
 I
 give
 you
 a
 little
 alleyoop.


I
 let
 you
 dunk
 the
 ball.


>> Why
 would
 we
 be
 in
 NATO?
 NATO
 is
 like


the
 single
 most
 destructive
 force
 that


we're
 a
 part
 of
 way
 more
 than
 the
 UN.


NATO


>> should
 we
 support
 Israel
 and
 give
 them


weapons.


>> It
 depends
 for
 what


you
 know


>> fight
 in
 Gaza
 and
 should
 they
 be
 our


number
 one
 partner
 in
 the
 region?


>> I
 think
 or
 the
 partner
 in
 the
 world


really.
 I
 think
 I
 think
 all
 of
 our


alliances
 should
 be
 assessed
 and
 now


reassessed
 through
 a
 single
 lens.
 Does


this
 help
 the
 United
 States
 and
 in
 the


specific
 instance
 I'm
 certainly
 not


against
 being
 allied
 with
 Israel
 and
 I'm


not
 against
 supplying
 Israel
 with


weapons?
 Again,
 it
 depends
 what
 they're


being
 used
 for.
 But
 I
 do
 think
 what's


happened
 in
 Gaza
 does
 not
 help
 the


United
 States
 at
 all.
 I
 mean,
 tell
 me


how
 it
 does.
 And
 um
 so
 yeah,
 I
 in
 fact,


I'm
 not
 even
 sure
 what
 the
 argument
 that


it
 has
 helped
 the
 United
 States
 would


be.
 I've
 never
 heard
 it
 articulated.


Instead,
 I've
 heard
 people
 name
 calling.


You
 know,
 from
 my
 perspective,
 that's


all
 I
 care
 about.
 And
 I
 got
 it.
 I
 never


wanted
 to
 have
 this
 debate.
 I
 avoided
 it


for
 many
 years.
 The
 only
 reason
 I
 get


into
 it
 was
 the
 prospect
 of
 a
 of
 a


regime
 change
 war
 in
 Iran.
 And
 I
 just


thought,
 man,
 there
 is
 no
 way
 that
 helps


us
 in
 any
 way.
 So,
 I
 piped
 up
 and
 said


something
 and
 my
 life
 has
 been
 a


disaster
 ever
 since.
 But
 my
 views
 have


not
 changed.
 Is
 it
 good
 for
 the
 US
 or


not?


>> What
 is
 the
 future
 of
 Europe
 and
 the
 UK?


>> Oh,
 it's
 so
 dark.
 I
 have
 family
 there.
 I


was
 just
 there.
 I
 mean
 just
 there
 um
 I


you
 know
 I
 let
 me
 start
 with
 the
 good


news.
 I
 mean,
 everyone
 knows
 all
 of


this,
 so
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 repeat
 any
 of


it
 other
 than
 to
 say
 finally
 Europeans,


even
 the
 Germans,
 I
 spoke
 to
 one
 of
 the


most
 powerful
 people
 in
 Germany


yesterday
 about
 this,
 are
 starting
 to


realize,
 wow,
 this
 is
 not
 going
 well
 at


all.
 And
 and
 migration
 is
 there
 are
 many


problems,
 but
 migration
 is
 the
 core


problem.
 The
 second
 is
 energy.
 And


they've
 made
 massive
 mistakes.
 They've


committed
 self
 harm
 over
 decades.
 We
 can


argue
 about
 why
 they
 did
 that,
 but


there's
 a
 growing
 realization
 that
 they


did.
 I
 was in
 Oslo
 this
 uh
 pretty


recently,
 salmon
 fishing.
 And
 you
 go
 to


Norway.
 I'm
 Scandinavian,
 so
 I
 pay


attention.
 And
 all
 they
 talk
 about
 is


Sweden.
 And
 of
 course,
 everyone's
 always


kind
 of
 looked
 up
 to
 Sweden
 because
 it's


huge
 and
 industrialized.
 And
 you
 know,


Norway
 looked
 up
 to
 Sweden.
 Now
 you
 go


to
 Norway
 and
 the
 Norwegians
 all
 say,


"Man,
 the
 one
 thing
 we're
 not
 going to


do
 is
 become
 Sweden
 and
 open
 our
 borders


and
 destroy
 ourselves."
 So
 I
 think
 the


Europeans
 are
 finally
 catching
 on
 to


this
 and
 that's
 a
 blessing.
 Is
 it
 too


late?


>> I
 hope
 not.
 Maybe
 Finland
 and
 Norway


caught
 it.
 Yeah,
 they
 caught
 it
 early


and
 said
 we
 can
 only
 have
 this
 many


people
 come
 in
 each
 year
 reasonably
 as
 a


society.


>> It's
 not
 that
 early.
 They've
 they've


made
 a
 mess
 of
 Oslo.
 Oslo
 is
 a
 is
 not


what
 it
 should
 be.
 But
 yeah,
 I
 mean
 it's


not
 totally
 destroyed.
 So
 yeah.


>> All
 right.
 Listen,
 when
 Tucker
 has
 a
 new


product
 or
 service
 in
 the
 world,
 uh
 we


he
 calls
 his
 boy
 Jal
 and
 we
 do
 a
 little


mutual
 support.
 You're
 today
 uh


launching
 uh
 some
 silver
 or
 gold


apparently.


>> Basically,
 we
 are
 selling
 gold
 as
 close


to
 wholesale
 as
 we
 possibly
 can.


>> Okay.
 And
 it's
 as
 usual
 a
 reaction


against
 all
 the
 gold
 scams
 going
 on.
 But


people
 should
 be
 able
 to
 easily
 buy


physical
 gold
 with
 a
 minor
 transparent


markup
 on
 the
 internet.
 You
 shouldn't


have
 to
 call
 a
 number
 so
 you're
 fooled


into
 buying
 a
 commemorative
 coin
 for,


you
 know,
 eight
 grand
 an
 ounce
 or


whatever,
 twice
 spot
 price.
 Um,
 so


that's
 that's
 the
 idea.
 And
 uh
 and
 it's


gone
 really
 well
 in
 the
 two
 weeks
 we've


been
 open.


>> What's
 the
 form
 factor?
 Are
 they
 It's


It's
 like
 1
 oz
 coins
 or
 you
 guys


>> Well,
 you
 can
 you
 can
 buy
 any
 kind
 of


precious
 metal.
 Um
 I
 I
 am
 a
 personally
 a


1oz
 coin
 buyer
 of
 long-standing.
 Turned


out
 to
 be
 a
 pretty
 good
 route.
 I
 would


say
 I
 was
 much
 mocked
 by
 everyone
 I


know.
 All
 the
 finance
 sophisticates
 I


went
 to
 college
 with
 were,
 you
 know,


making
 fun
 of
 me.
 You're
 a
 gold
 bug.


You're
 crazy.
 Um
 and
 yeah,
 I
 do
 bury
 it


in
 my
 yard
 because
 that's
 the
 kind
 of


man
 I
 am,
 primitive.
 Um,
 but
 it
 has


turned
 out
 to
 be
 a
 good
 thing.
 No,
 you


can
 buy
 with
 a
 shovel.


>> Oh,
 well,
 I've
 I've
 thought
 that


through,
 Chima.
 I've
 also
 scattered


millions
 of
 ball
 bearings
 around
 my


backyard.
 So,
 good
 luck
 with
 your
 metal


detector.


>> That's
 so
 awesome.


>> I'm
 not
 kidding.
 By
 the
 way,


>> also
 coming
 in
 2026,
 uh,
 Tucker


Carlson's
 baked
 beans
 and
 fat.


When
 you're
 prospecting
 out
 in
 the
 Wild


West,
 you
 can
 get
 your
 Can
 I
 hear


something
 weird?
 I
 used
 to
 work
 in
 a


baked
 bean
 factory,
 actually,
 B&M
 baked


beans
 in
 Portland,
 Maine
 in
 1988,
 and


for
 the
 summer,
 and
 I've
 never
 eaten
 a


baked
 bean
 since
 because
 I
 made
 them
 and


I
 I
 ODed
 on
 baked
 beans,
 but
 in
 general,


they're
 good.


>> Go
 buy
 yourself
 a
 gold
 coin
 at
 Battalion


Medals.


>> I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 great
 idea.
 I
 have
 to


be
 really
 honest
 with
 you.
 M


>> I
 do
 think
 that
 having
 this
 as
 a


practical
 hedge,
 there's
 like
 a
 whole


set
 of
 elements
 that
 we
 all
 have
 to
 be


educated
 on
 to
 hedge


>> the
 status
 quo
 and
 there
 are
 lots
 of


reasons
 to
 own
 cryptocurrencies,
 gold.


>> I'm
 glad
 you're
 doing
 this
 because
 the


way
 that
 this
 is
 done
 for
 most
 people
 is


completely


>> bonkers
 and
 these
 sites
 unlike
 yours


that
 typically
 sell
 direct
 to
 retail
 do


not
 do
 a
 good
 job.
 So,
 I'm
 glad
 you're


doing
 it.
 I
 hope
 it's
 a
 success.
 Thank


you.
 And
 let
 me
 put
 also
 put
 in
 a
 good


word
 for
 firewood
 and
 ammunition.
 I


don't
 think
 those
 are
 better
 if
 you
 want


to
 diversify
 your
 portfolio.


>> Also,
 two
 wells.
 You
 got
 to
 have
 two


wells,
 not
 just
 one.
 Different
 depths.


That's
 what
 I
 have
 on
 the
 ranch.
 Two


wells.


>> Look,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 going to
 be
 very


successful.
 Uh,
 congratulations,
 Tucker.


I
 think
 this
 will
 be
 a
 very
 successful


venture
 because
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 trust


with
 your
 audience
 and
 if
 like
 you're


going
 to
 sell
 gold,
 like
 that's
 the
 most


important
 thing
 is
 people
 just
 want
 to


know
 that
 this
 is
 like
 100%
 legit


>> pure
 gold.
 And


>> what's
 your
 daily
 carry?


>> And
 the
 lowest
 price
 they
 can
 get.


>> What's
 your
 daily
 what's
 your
 daily


carry?
 What
 do
 you
 What
 do
 you
 carry


around
 the
 the
 the
 ranch
 or
 whatever?


What's
 your
 daily


>> How
 much
 do
 I
 carry
 in
 gold?


>> No.
 What's
 your
 what's
 your
 pistol?


What's
 your
 piece?
 What
 do
 you
 keep
 on


your
 side?


>> Oh,
 I
 carry
 a
 Ruger
 LCR
 in
 38
 special.
 I


like
 the
 revolver
 cuz
 it
 doesn't
 go
 off


accidentally
 and
 castrate
 you.
 So,
 yes,


that's
 personally


>> 100
 Ruger.
 It's
 a
 great


>> Okay,
 so
 people
 like
 these
 highcapacity


striker
 fire
 handguns
 and
 I
 just
 I'm
 a


revolver
 man.
 Everyone
 makes
 fun
 of
 me,


but
 that's
 how
 I
 feel.


>> No,
 you
 know
 what?
 You
 leave
 that


revolver
 in
 the
 bottom
 of
 a
 pool
 for


three
 years,
 take
 it
 out,
 hammer
 some


nails,
 and
 then
 fire
 it.
 Still
 fires,


>> dude.
 I'm


the
 liberal
 here.
 Really?
 You
 don't
 say


>> I'm
 a
 I'm
 a
 moderate.
 They
 say
 liberal


to
 keep
 people
 tuning
 in.
 All right,


everybody.


>> When
 he's
 selling
 ads,
 he's
 a
 liberal.


When
 he's
 spending
 his
 money,
 he's
 a


conservative.
 I
 live
 I'm
 the
 only
 guy


who
 lives
 in
 Texas
 on
 a
 ranch
 and


carries
 a
 firearm.
 So,
 we'll
 just
 leave


it
 at
 that.
 But,
 you
 never
 know.
 I
 might


have
 some

 guy
 moving
 to
 Texas.
 He's
 living


two
 lives.


>> He's
 living
 two
 lives.
 Every
 time
 he


gets
 on
 a
 PJ,
 he's
 a
 conservative,
 but


every
 time
 he
 has
 to
 talk
 to
 people,


he's
 living

 the
 PC24
 and
 the
 Phenom
 300
 are
 great


planes.
 And
 we
 had
 our
 holiday
 party


last
 weekend.
 Wish
 you
 were
 there,


Tucker.
 Tony
 Hingcliffe

down.

bit
 of

 by


all.
