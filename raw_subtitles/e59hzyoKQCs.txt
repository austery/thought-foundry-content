David
 and
 I
 are
 staying
 in
 a


300-year-old
 house
 and
 uh
 we've
 both


smashed
 our
 head
 on
 the
 beams
 twice


already.
 Uh
 but
 this
 is
 both
 our
 first


Davos,
 David.
 It's
 our
 first
 Davos.


We've
 been
 here
 for
 24
 hours
 and
 um
 uh


any
 first
 impressions
 here.


>> Um
 it's
 interesting.
 You
 know,
 we're


we're
 staying
 very
 far
 away.


>> Yeah,


>> they
 didn't
 apparently
 they
 didn't
 want


you
 to
 be
 part
 of
 this.


>> They
 didn't
 want
 me
 too
 close.
 Yeah.


>> But
 we
 finally
 we
 got
 you
 finally
 got


you
 an
 invitation.
 your
 invitation
 to


not
 get
 lost
 in
 the
 mail.


>> My
 invitation
 didn't
 get
 lost
 in
 the


mail
 this
 time.


>> For
 those
 of
 you
 who
 watch
 the
 pod,
 you


know
 what
 I'm
 talking
 about.


>> Inside
 joke.
 Um,
 but
 it's
 great
 to
 be


here
 and
 uh
 great
 to
 be
 here
 at
 USA


House.
 Thanks
 to
 all
 the
 sponsors
 and
 um


really
 delighted
 for
 our
 first
 guest
 for


the
 pod.
 Sarah
 Rogers
 works
 for
 is
 the


under
 secretary
 uh
 for
 public
 diplomacy


at
 the
 State
 Department.
 for
 members


here
 who
 don't
 know
 this
 position
 or


what
 you've
 been
 charged
 with
 or
 what


you've
 decided
 to
 work
 on.
 I'm
 curious


about
 that.
 Do
 they
 tell
 you
 what
 to
 do


or
 do
 you
 come
 up
 with
 your
 own
 mandate?


But
 yeah,
 tell
 us
 everything
 about
 what


you're
 doing.


>> Longtime
 listener,
 first
 time
 guest
 and


thank
 you
 to
 both
 of
 us.
 Uh
 thank
 you


from
 all
 of
 us
 at
 America
 House
 for


joining
 us
 here.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 I
 am
 the
 under
 secretary
 for
 public


diplomacy
 and
 when
 I
 got
 this


nomination,
 my
 friends
 and
 family
 all


congratulated
 me
 and
 then
 conferably


said
 what
 is
 that?


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 so
 diplomacy
 traditionally


concerns
 the
 relationship
 between
 the


American
 government
 and
 foreign


governments.
 Two
 ambassadors,
 shake


hands,
 make
 a
 deal,
 um
 solve
 a
 war.
 But


public
 diplomacy
 is
 different.
 Public


diplomacy
 addresses
 the
 relationship


between
 the
 American
 government
 and


foreign
 publics.
 And
 this
 has
 become
 a


very
 important
 under
 secretariat
 with


the
 rise
 of
 the
 internet
 and
 then
 during


the
 Biden
 administration
 especially
 uh


these
 mushrooming
 concerns
 about


so-called
 disinformation
 and
 what
 do
 we


do
 when
 there
 are
 allegedly
 malign


influences
 on
 the
 public
 view
 of
 America


um
 the
 public's
 intersection
 with


American
 interest
 how
 do
 we
 interact


with
 the
 internet
 and
 the
 information


ecosystem
 that
 is
 part
 of
 my
 portfolio
 I


also
 oversee
 other
 soft
 power
 activities


including
 our
 educational
 and
 cultural


and
 sports
 diplomacy.
 So
 I
 am
 privileged


to
 play
 a
 role
 in
 the
 World
 Cup
 this


summer
 and
 the
 LA
 Olympics
 coming
 up
 and


uh
 the
 Fulbright
 program
 and
 others
 like


it.
 So


>> you
 seem
 particularly
 focused
 on
 freedom


of
 speech
 and
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 tension


between
 our
 standards
 and
 the
 companies


in
 America
 which
 have
 made
 the
 move
 to


being
 strongly
 freedom
 of
 speech.


something
 that
 kind
 of
 got
 lost
 in
 our


industry
 for
 a
 couple
 years
 in


technology
 but
 has
 now
 made
 I
 think
 um


some
 significant
 progress
 on
 does
 seem


like
 some
 folks
 in
 Europe
 don't
 share


our
 love
 of
 freedom
 of
 speech.
 Maybe
 you


could
 explain
 to
 us
 what
 the
 tension
 is


today
 and
 what
 some
 of
 the
 regulations


are
 that
 have
 been
 put
 in
 place
 in


Europe.


>> Sure.
 Absolutely.
 So
 the
 two
 main


regulations
 that
 I've
 interfaced
 with


since
 taking
 office
 and
 part
 of
 this
 is


just
 a
 product
 of
 my
 first
 official
 trip


was
 to
 Europe
 and
 while
 I
 was
 in
 Europe


a
 large
 fine
 came
 down
 on
 an
 American


platform
 X
 under
 the
 digital
 services


act
 which
 I'll
 get
 into
 in
 a
 moment.
 So


Europe
 um
 especially
 since
 since
 the


second
 world
 war
 but
 I
 think
 really


since
 the
 American
 founding
 and
 our


codification
 of
 the
 first
 amendment
 you


know
 America
 has
 taken
 a
 much
 stronger


approach
 on
 free
 speech
 than
 even
 most


of
 the
 west
 and
 with
 the
 rise
 of
 the


internet
 and
 all
 communication
 or
 a
 lot


of
 communication
 becoming
 transnational.


We
 see
 these
 new
 technocratic
 regulatory


frameworks
 in
 Europe
 bumping
 up
 against


the
 commitments
 to
 free
 speech
 in
 the


United
 States.
 And
 Jason
 makes
 an


important
 observation
 that
 for
 a
 while


some
 of
 these
 large
 American
 technology


platforms
 were
 more
 inclined
 to
 moderate


or
 to
 censor
 kind
 of
 in
 conformity
 with


some
 prevailing
 um
 some
 prevailing
 norms


and
 concerns
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 But
 I


think
 in
 the
 United
 States
 we've
 shifted


back
 toward
 a
 less
 centurious
 approach


and
 so
 have
 these
 platforms.
 And
 at
 the


same
 time,
 you
 have
 uh
 regulatory


efforts
 in
 Europe
 and
 the
 UK.
 And
 I'll


I'll
 name
 a
 couple
 that
 I
 think
 have


been
 particularly
 relevant.
 So
 the
 UK


has
 something
 called
 the
 online
 safety


act.
 The
 online
 safety
 act
 imposes
 age


gating
 obligations
 on
 a
 broad
 swath
 of


content,
 almost
 any
 content
 that's


upsetting,
 and
 then
 requires
 platforms


to
 run
 risk
 assessments
 for
 and
 in
 some


cases
 remove
 content
 that
 the
 UK
 would


say
 is
 illegal.
 And
 in
 the
 UK,
 you
 know,


major
 categories
 of
 content
 are
 banned,


are
 rendered
 illegal.
 That
 would
 not
 be


illegal
 in
 the
 United
 States,
 which
 is


where
 these
 platforms
 are
 located,
 which


is
 where
 their
 original
 user
 base
 is,


which
 is
 where
 their
 executives
 live
 um


and
 which
 is
 their
 primary
 regulator.


So,
 under
 the
 online
 safety
 act,
 we
 now


have
 um
 active
 litigation
 by
 the


relevant
 regulator
 against
 several


American
 websites.
 These
 are
 websites


that
 don't
 reach
 into
 the
 UK.
 They're


not
 these
 aren't
 websites
 dedicated
 to


discussing
 the
 queen.
 They're
 not


websites
 that
 sell
 goods
 in
 the
 United


Kingdom.
 These
 are
 websites
 that
 exist


on
 American
 soil,
 host
 large
 quantities


of
 American
 users,
 and
 in
 often
 in


oftentimes
 discuss
 American
 political


topics.
 But
 because
 users
 are
 permitted


to
 discuss
 them
 in
 a
 way
 that
 offends
 UK


law,
 there's
 the
 imposition
 of
 a
 UK


fine.
 The
 Digital
 Services
 Act
 in
 the
 EU


is
 similar.
 So
 DSA


contains
 but
 doesn't
 just
 contain
 uh


contentbased
 regulations,
 hate
 speech


regulations.
 So
 DSA
 requires
 all
 of
 the


EU
 member
 states
 to
 adopt
 at
 minimum


kind
 of
 a
 floor
 for
 hate
 speech


prohibition.
 And
 those
 prohibitions
 in


the
 statute,
 I
 think,
 are
 much
 vagger


than
 American
 lawyers
 are
 accustomed
 to.


And
 one
 of
 our
 one
 of
 our
 jurist


credential
 principles
 under
 the
 American


First
 Amendment
 is
 if
 you're
 going
 to


enact
 any
 regulation
 that
 comes
 close
 to


touching
 speech,
 it
 needs
 to
 be
 very


clear
 what
 you
 are
 prohibiting
 because


you
 have
 this
 chilling
 effect
 concept.
 A


vague
 prohibition
 will
 chill
 speech,


especially
 when
 that
 prohibition
 is


imposed
 on
 a
 large
 riskaverse


corporation.
 So
 you
 impose
 vague


prohibitions
 on
 large
 riskaverse


corporations
 and
 that's
 how
 it
 becomes


illegal
 to
 make
 jokes
 around
 the
 water


cooler
 for
 example.
 You
 see
 the
 same


effect
 here.
 Digital
 services
 act
 also


regulates
 other
 aspects
 of
 um
 digital


commerce
 and
 social
 media.
 So
 it


regulates
 um
 things
 like
 transparency


and
 competition.
 And
 I
 think
 you
 know
 we


have
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 Europeans
 in
 the


audience
 today
 and
 I
 hope
 none
 of
 them


will
 find
 it
 contentious
 if
 I
 suggest


that
 in
 Europe
 there
 is
 more
 of
 a
 focus


on
 uh
 technocratic
 regulation
 as
 an


arbiter
 of
 what's
 acceptable
 than
 there


might
 be
 in
 America
 where
 we
 have
 this


tradition
 that
 um
 really
 emphasizes
 like


rugged
 individualism
 and
 individual


conscience.
 And
 to
 be
 clear,
 no
 one
 is


saying,
 certainly
 not
 the
 State


Department
 or
 America,
 hey,
 you
 can't


have
 your
 own
 platforms
 in
 Europe,


right?


>> Build
 your
 own.
 Build
 your
 own
 Facebook,


build
 your
 own
 Instagram,
 build
 your
 own


Twitter/X,


uh,
 Tik
 Tok,
 whatever
 you'd
 like
 to


build,
 and
 you
 can
 have
 whatever


standards
 you
 like
 on
 your
 platforms.


We're
 saying,
 "Hey,
 these
 are
 our


platforms.
 This
 is
 our
 standard,
 and
 we


don't
 want
 our
 users
 uh
 or
 our
 platforms


to
 be
 receiving
 fines."
 That's
 that's


our
 position.


>> I
 I
 think
 I
 think
 that's
 basically
 it.


And
 look,
 when
 American
 companies


operate
 abroad,
 they
 abide
 by
 the
 laws


where
 they
 operate.
 But
 at
 a
 certain


point,
 so
 so
 we
 recently
 issued
 some


sanctions,
 which
 we'll
 get
 into.
 And
 one


of
 the
 individuals
 we
 sanctioned
 uh
 was


a
 former
 EU
 official
 who
 threatened
 Elon


Musk
 with
 enforcement
 action
 because
 X


within
 the
 United
 States
 had
 said
 that


it
 was
 going
 to
 host
 on
 a
 live
 uh


Twitter
 space
 an
 interview
 with
 Donald


Trump,
 our
 president.
 So
 it
 wasn't
 that


Donald
 Trump
 had
 said
 anything


violative.
 It
 wasn't
 there
 was
 a


specific
 piece
 of
 content
 that
 the
 EU


wanted
 to
 ban.
 It
 was
 just
 that
 the
 act


of
 an
 American
 business
 hosting
 an


interview
 with
 an
 American
 president


might
 offend
 EU
 uh
 EU
 preferences
 about


speech
 generated
 a
 regulatory
 threat.


And
 when
 you
 reach
 across
 borders
 and


make
 a
 threat
 like
 that,
 that
 offends


American
 interests
 and
 American
 values.


And
 so
 you
 can
 expect
 America
 to


respond.
 And
 I
 think
 so
 I
 my
 history
 is


as
 an
 American
 lawyer
 in
 American
 courts


and
 we
 have
 you
 know
 we're
 a
 nation
 of


50
 states
 and
 each
 state
 has
 its
 own


regulations
 and
 we've
 had
 to
 think
 about


you
 know
 when
 there's
 a
 website
 in


California
 that
 operates
 in
 Texas
 how
 do


you
 decide
 to
 what
 extent
 Texas
 gets
 to


regulate
 and
 we
 have
 all
 these


jurisdictional
 concepts
 like
 does
 the


website
 purposefully
 avail
 itself
 of
 the


forum
 is
 it
 is
 are
 you
 posting


defamatory
 statements
 about
 a
 person
 in


Texas
 but
 the
 mere
 existence
 of
 a


website
 in
 California
 that
 Texas
 doesn't


like
 is
 hardly
 ever,
 basically
 never,
 a


basis
 for
 regulation.
 And
 so
 when
 we


talk
 about
 things
 like
 extr


territoriality,
 you
 know,
 what
 we're


really
 talking
 about
 is
 it's
 undisputed


that
 Europeans
 get
 to
 have
 their
 own


laws
 in
 Europe,
 but
 we
 also
 get
 to
 have


our
 own
 laws
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 And


we're
 celebrating
 250
 years
 of
 American


independence.
 And
 so
 we
 want,
 you
 know,


we
 want
 our
 markets
 to
 be
 able
 to


interoperate
 online.
 Um,
 but
 we're
 not


willing
 to
 give
 up
 American
 freedom
 of


speech
 and
 the
 bargain.


>> Hey,
 David,
 when
 we
 look
 at,
 and
 I'm


asking
 you
 this
 one
 so
 I
 can
 give
 you
 a


pass
 on
 it,
 but
 what
 what
 do
 you
 think


people
 are
 so
 scared
 of
 in
 the
 UK
 when


it
 comes
 to
 freedom
 of
 speech?
 Uh,
 and


and
 maybe
 the
 most
 freedom
 of
 the
 the


most
 um
 rockus
 platform
 X
 specifically.


>> Well,
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 people
 are


afraid.
 I
 think
 the
 government
 is
 afraid


of
 the
 people
 criticizing
 it
 and


therefore
 they're
 engaged
 in
 what


sensors
 always
 do
 which
 is
 protect
 the


people
 in
 power.
 Um
 there's
 something


Sarah
 you
 you
 should
 explain
 this
 to
 us


but
 as
 I
 understand
 there
 have
 been
 over


12,000
 people
 is
 it
 prosecuted
 or


>> arrested


>> arrested
 under
 the
 online
 safety
 act.


Was
 that
 just
 in
 one
 year
 or
 is
 that


since
 it


>> that
 that
 was
 in
 2023
 alone?


>> Okay.


>> But
 that
 isn't
 just
 under
 the
 online


safety
 act.
 So
 I
 think
 what's


particularly
 insidious
 and
 particularly


relevant
 about
 statutes
 like
 the
 OSA
 and


the
 DSA
 is
 that
 these
 are
 portals


through
 which
 existing
 censorship
 laws


get
 applied
 to
 the
 internet.
 So
 a
 lot
 of


these
 Brits
 are
 arrested
 under
 um
 ex
 of


under
 existing
 statutes
 like
 there's
 a


communications
 act,
 there's
 a
 law


against
 inciting
 quote
 unquote
 racial
 or


religious
 hatred.
 And
 we,
 I
 think,
 have


differences
 of
 opinion
 about,
 you
 know,


what
 amounts
 to
 incitement
 in
 America


versus
 the
 UK.
 But
 so,
 for
 example,
 uh,


you
 had
 a
 comedian
 called
 Graeme
 Lahan


who
 tweeted
 that,
 um,
 if
 a
 woman
 sees
 a


penis
 in
 a
 in
 a
 ladies
 room,
 you
 know,


she
 should
 feel
 free
 to
 kick
 that
 guy
 in


the
 balls.
 And
 that's
 that's
 something
 a


lot
 of
 comedians
 say,
 and
 I
 think
 it


channels
 an
 impulse
 that
 a
 lot
 of


Americans
 and
 Europeans
 would
 frankly


consider
 common
 sense.
 But
 he
 was


dragged
 out
 of
 the
 airport
 like
 a


terrorist,
 had
 his
 devices
 confiscated,


was
 thrown
 in
 jail
 overnight
 and
 lost


access,
 my
 understanding
 is
 to
 his
 heart


medication
 if
 I
 recall
 correctly.


>> And
 because
 this
 was
 an
 incitement
 to


violence


>> because
 this
 offended
 some
 existing
 law


against
 uh
 provocative
 speech
 in
 the
 UK


and
 the
 the
 online
 safety
 act
 is
 a


device
 through
 which
 all
 of
 those


existing
 laws
 get
 applied
 to
 the


internet.
 You
 had
 another
 case
 in
 the
 UK


where
 Joey
 Breton,
 a
 footballer,
 um,


called
 somebody
 a
 bike
 nonce,
 which


nonce
 is
 not
 an
 American
 term,
 but
 I


imagine
 you're
 insinuating
 someone
 is


affeminate
 for
 riding
 a
 bike
 so
 much
 or


in
 the
 manner
 that
 he
 rides
 the
 bike.


And
 that
 resulted
 in
 a
 suspended
 prison


sentence,
 but
 still
 a
 prison
 sentence


>> because
 he
 called
 somebody
 desty.


>> Yeah.
 Basically,


>> that's
 what
 we
 call
 in
 United
 States.


>> And
 there
 were
 there
 was
 there
 were
 some


other
 tweets,
 too,
 but
 none
 none
 that


would
 meet
 the
 bar
 for
 American


incitement.
 So,
 David,
 you're
 absolutely


right.
 So
 that
 was
 in
 a
 single
 year
 of


slightly
 over
 12,000
 Brits
 arrested
 for


speech
 acts
 and
 that
 is
 more
 than
 more


than
 we're
 arrested
 that
 year
 in
 Russia,


more
 than
 in
 China,
 more
 than
 in
 Turkey.


And
 when
 you
 talk
 to
 Brits
 about
 this,


you
 know,
 you're
 absolutely
 right.
 Most


of
 the
 British
 people
 that
 you
 talk
 to


say
 this
 is
 totally
 unacceptable.
 And
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 polls
 in
 the
 UK,
 you
 see


public
 sentiment
 against
 this
 kind
 of


thing.
 But
 I've
 I've
 had,
 you
 know,
 both


public
 and
 private
 engagements
 with


regulators
 in
 these
 countries.
 And
 the


defense
 you
 hear
 is
 well,
 you
 know,
 we


have
 a
 less
 chilling,
 less
 totalitarian


environment
 than
 China.
 So
 maybe
 more


people
 are
 willing
 to
 break
 the
 rules,


more
 people
 are
 willing
 to
 offend.
 But


if
 you
 arrest
 12,000
 people
 a
 year
 for


speech
 and
 you're
 raising
 children
 in
 an


ecosystem
 where
 you
 can
 be
 dragged
 out


of
 the
 airport
 for
 offending
 the
 dogmas


of
 transgender
 activism,


>> then
 you
 might
 not
 have
 a
 different


culture
 than
 China
 for
 long.


And
 and
 why
 should
 the
 United
 States
 be


paying
 to
 defend
 your
 country
 and


support
 it
 in
 fighting
 say
 a
 proxy
 war


against
 Russia
 if
 that's
 basically
 the


values
 that
 are
 being
 enforced.


>> Right.
 Exactly.
 When
 we
 interact
 with


our
 NATO
 allies
 in
 the
 NATO
 context,
 we


hear
 a
 lot
 about
 our
 shared
 history
 and


shared
 values.
 And
 it's
 time
 to
 ask,
 you


know,
 what
 values
 do
 we
 still
 share?
 We


together
 with
 our
 allies
 comprised
 the


free
 world
 after
 World
 War
 II
 and
 the


free
 world
 that
 was
 assembled
 against


communism.
 But
 the
 cornerstone
 of
 a
 free


world
 of
 any
 free
 society
 has
 to
 be


freedom
 of
 speech


>> and
 criticizing
 and
 the
 uncomfortable


speech
 is
 where
 this
 actual
 defense
 is


necessary.


>> Yes.


>> And
 we
 have
 a
 very
 special,
 you
 know,


bent
 in
 the
 United
 States
 to
 really
 go


after
 our
 leaders.
 I
 do
 it
 every
 week


with
 David
 um
 since
 he's
 now
 a
 public


servant.
 I
 mean,
 we
 go
 at
 it
 and
 they're


knocking
 on
 people's
 doors
 strictly
 for


saying
 like,
 "Hey,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 might


have
 disagreements
 with
 the
 Catholic


Church.
 I'm
 a
 Catholic."


>> Well,
 a
 lot
 of
 it's
 about
 immigration,


right?
 I
 mean,
 so
 I've
 seen
 a
 bunch
 of


these
 examples,
 you
 know,
 on
 X.
 I
 saw
 um


one
 clip
 on
 X
 where
 a
 judge
 was
 handing


down
 a
 2-year
 sentence
 against
 somebody.


I
 don't know
 if
 if
 this
 rings
 a
 bell,


but
 supposedly
 for
 speech
 that
 I
 think


was
 criticizing
 the
 UK's
 open


immigration
 policies.
 That's
 where
 I


sense
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 the
 prosecutions
 are.


Right.


>> Right.
 And
 this
 is
 another
 place
 where,


you
 know,
 free
 speech
 and
 freedom
 of


expression
 are
 American
 values
 and


interests
 in
 and
 of
 themselves.
 But


another
 priority
 for
 the
 administration


is
 common
 sense
 on
 mass
 migration.
 And
 a


lot
 of
 the
 speech
 that
 offends
 those
 in


power
 has
 to
 do
 with
 migration
 policy.


So,
 there
 was
 a
 31-month
 sentence
 handed


down
 to
 a
 suburban
 mother
 named
 Lucy


Connelly
 in
 the
 UK
 uh
 because
 after
 a


man
 called
 Axel
 Rudabanka
 stabbed
 I


think
 it
 was
 a
 seven-year-old
 girl,
 an


8-year-old
 girl,
 and
 a
 nine-year-old


girl
 at
 a
 birthday
 party.
 There
 was


ensuing
 unrest
 and
 she
 she
 tweeted
 uh


something
 anti-migration
 and
 it
 was


pretty
 inflammatory,
 but
 it
 would
 have


been
 unambiguously
 legal
 in
 the
 United


States.
 Um,
 she
 said,
 'If
 this
 is
 what


migration
 is
 going
 to
 do
 to
 our
 country,


and
 I'm
 paraphrasing
 slightly,
 but
 I


remember
 it
 pretty
 well.
 If
 this
 is
 what


migration
 means,
 then
 burn
 down
 the


migrant
 hotels
 for
 all
 I
 care.
 Uh,
 this


was
 a
 berieved
 mother
 who'
 lost
 a
 child.


She
 saw
 three
 little
 girls
 murdered
 for


no
 reason.
 And
 she
 reacted
 and
 then
 she


felt
 bad
 and
 she
 deleted
 the
 tweet.
 That


was
 a
 30
 31-month
 sentence.


>> 31
 month


>> 31month
 sentence
 in
 the
 United
 Kingdom.


Meanwhile,
 you
 have
 actual
 pedophiles,


actual
 child
 sex
 offenders
 who
 get


minimal
 prison
 or
 none
 in
 the
 United


Kingdom.
 And
 that
 that's
 led
 to
 this
 um


epithet
 that
 you
 hear
 among
 UK


activists,
 this
 quote
 unquote
 two-tier


policing,
 this
 activist
 cause
 that


they've
 assembled
 around
 because
 they


sense
 that
 if
 you
 oppose
 mass
 migration,


if
 you
 make
 that
 kind
 of
 critique,
 you


are
 subject
 to
 a
 different
 justice


system
 than
 the
 kind
 of
 person
 who


merely
 agitates
 for
 Sharia
 law
 in


Britain
 or
 merely
 downloads
 child


pornography
 in
 Britain.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 okay.
 So,


>> I
 emphasized
 that
 for


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 mean
 so
 I
 think
 um


>> that
 was
 the
 gong
 of
 righteousness.


>> We
 appreciate
 it.


>> And
 then
 just
 to
 add
 one
 more
 dimension


to
 this
 uh
 so
 US
 companies
 have
 been


getting
 fined
 like
 crazy
 right
 in
 the
 UK


and
 then
 the
 EU.
 Um
 and
 I
 think
 it's


related
 to
 this
 issue
 but
 can
 you
 just


describe
 that
 like


>> Yeah.
 Um
 because
 that
 that's
 where
 this


crosses
 over
 into


you
 know
 an
 ally
 doing
 something
 that
 we


think
 is
 mad
 into
 directly
 hurting


American
 interests
 I
 guess
 right
 or


>> right
 so
 I
 don't
 believe
 there
 have
 been


any
 big
 fines
 under
 the
 UK
 online
 safety


act
 yet
 but
 um
 its
 provisions
 take


effect
 over
 time
 and
 some
 of
 those


provisions
 are
 just
 coming
 online
 now


including
 the
 ones
 relating
 to
 AI
 okay


>> and
 we
 have
 active
 litigation
 in


American
 courts
 right
 now.
 Um,
 one
 of


the
 leading
 lawsuits
 involves
 the


website
 4chan,
 which
 people
 who
 are
 very


online
 in
 America
 may
 be
 familiar
 with.


4chan
 is
 kind
 of
 a
 no
 holdsbred
 uh


promodial
 soup
 for
 memes
 and
 the
 like.


The
 cat
 memes
 come
 out
 of
 there.
 A
 lot


of
 activism
 Occupy
 Wall
 Street
 came
 out


of
 4chan,
 but
 4chan
 has
 essentially
 no


censorship
 rules.
 It
 bans
 child


pornography.
 That's
 pretty
 much
 it.
 And


so
 the
 UK
 has
 decided
 that
 4chan
 is
 not


allowed
 to
 exist
 unless
 it
 pays
 a
 bunch


of
 money
 to
 the
 United
 Kingdom
 for
 not


policing
 its
 speech
 in
 accord
 with
 uh
 UK


laws,
 the
 numerous
 UK
 speech
 statutes


that
 led
 to
 prison
 sentences
 like
 the


one
 I
 just
 discussed.
 But
 there
 was
 a


large
 fine
 handed
 down
 during
 my
 recent


European
 tour
 against
 X
 and
 I
 believe
 it


wasund€140


million
 euros,
 but
 that
 might
 be


dollars.
 I'm


>> Elon
 because
 they
 disagree
 with
 his


influence
 uh
 in


>> uh
 the
 UK.


>> Look,
 I
 can't
 speak
 for
 the
 UK


regulators,
 but
 I
 can
 make
 inferences.


What's


>> your
 ex
 X
 has
 a
 particular
 political


veillance.
 Um
 we
 saw
 Joe
 Biden
 after


Elon
 acquired
 Twitter
 saying,
 you
 know,


we
 we've
 got
 to
 find
 ways
 to
 go
 after


him.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 that
 sentiment


might
 be
 shared.
 But
 as
 an
 under


secretary
 of
 state,
 I'm
 not
 an
 advocate


for
 one
 American
 company
 or
 even
 one


American
 viewpoint
 on
 the
 free
 speech


issue.
 If
 any
 American
 company
 were


fined,
 let's
 say
 $140
 million
 even
 by
 a


foreign
 power
 for
 upholding
 the
 American


first
 amendment,
 um
 if
 General
 Motors


were
 treated
 that
 way,
 you
 know,
 the
 US


government
 would
 have
 something
 to
 say


about
 it.
 I
 also
 think
 that
 X
 is
 not
 the


first
 company
 to
 be
 fined
 under
 EU


digital
 regulations.
 So
 there's
 an


infographic
 that
 circulated
 recently


comparing,
 you
 know,
 revenues
 raised


within
 the
 EU
 through
 other
 metrics
 and


then
 revenues
 raised
 just
 by
 finding


American
 tech
 companies.
 And
 there's
 a


suspicion
 that
 this
 is
 really
 kind
 of
 a


de
 facto
 tax
 tax
 and
 pretexts
 are


contrived
 for
 finding
 large
 American


tech
 companies
 in
 order
 to
 raise


revenue.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 so
 that
 was
 the
 thing
 I
 think


I
 was
 referring
 to
 is
 that
 um
 and
 I


think
 actually
 the
 president
 may
 have
 um


truth
 that
 out
 um
 that
 I
 think
 the
 the


maybe
 this
 is
 more
 the
 EU
 but
 the
 the


DSA
 has
 become
 almost
 like
 a
 digital


speed
 trap
 to
 try
 and
 find
 American


companies
 and
 it
 does
 massly


disproportionately


affect
 them
 to
 the
 point
 where
 you
 could


argue
 that
 it's
 effectively
 like
 a


tariff
 on
 American
 tech
 companies


operating
 in
 Europe.
 And
 if
 that's
 the


case,
 well,
 I
 mean,
 I
 guess
 Europe
 is


allowed
 to
 have
 tariffs,
 but
 then
 that's


going
 to
 change
 the
 tariffs
 that
 we
 set.


So,
 it's
 all
 part
 of
 a
 larger
 trade


negotiation,


>> right?
 Exactly.
 I've
 referred
 to
 the
 DSA


before
 as
 a
 censorship
 tariff
 because


the
 cost
 of
 maintaining
 the
 censorship


apparatus
 under
 the
 DSA
 is
 intentionally


levied
 on
 specific
 companies,
 mostly


American
 ones,
 that
 are
 that
 are
 subject


to
 higher
 and
 more
 intricate
 regulatory


standards
 than
 other
 companies
 are.
 And


EU
 regulators
 say,
 "Well,
 that's
 not


because
 they're
 American,
 that's
 because


they're
 large."
 But
 the
 fact
 that


they're
 American
 and
 not
 European
 surely


makes
 them
 easier
 as
 a
 political


proposition
 to
 tax.
 And
 so
 a
 lot
 of


Americans
 see
 this
 as
 a
 tax.


>> Really
 bizarre.
 David,
 we're
 seeing


we're
 living
 in
 a
 time
 where
 we're


seeing
 freedom
 of
 speech
 expression
 go


down
 in
 Europe
 and
 go
 up
 in
 the
 Middle


East.


>> You
 know,
 they
 just
 had
 the
 Riad
 comedy


festival.
 There
 were
 some
 rules.
 Hey,


you
 can't
 criticize
 the
 kingdom.


Let's
 leave
 religion
 off
 the
 table.
 But


you
 can
 go
 after
 your
 own.
 But
 uh
 we
 we


might
 not
 uh
 we
 might
 have
 some
 uh


sensitivities
 there
 and
 um
 you
 know
 and


then
 there's
 everything
 in
 between.


South
 Korea
 does
 require
 you
 have
 a


social
 security
 number
 essentially
 to


post
 online.
 Um
 but
 David,
 I'm
 I'm


wondering
 what
 you
 think
 about
 this


overall
 trend
 in
 the
 world
 of
 what
 we're


seeing
 with
 censorship.


>> I
 mean
 it's
 not
 a
 good
 trend.
 Um,
 I


think
 that
 the
 the
 purpose
 of


censorship,
 like
 I
 mentioned
 before,
 is


always
 to
 protect
 the
 people
 in
 power


and
 and
 and
 specifically
 it
 it
 insulates


them
 from
 criticism,
 but
 it'd
 be
 a
 lot


better
 for
 them
 to
 hear
 that
 criticism


and
 adjust
 their
 policies
 than
 it
 would


be
 to
 try
 and
 switch
 off
 the,
 you
 know,


the
 feedback
 altogether.


>> And
 it's
 very
 clear,
 I
 think,
 in
 Europe


and
 the
 UK
 that
 these
 policies
 of
 open


migration,
 mass
 migration
 are
 very


unpopular.
 Why
 not
 listen
 to
 the
 people


and
 adjust
 your
 policies
 instead
 of


trying
 to
 silence
 them?


>> Uh,
 say
 what
 you
 will
 about
 President


Trump.
 Uh,
 and
 people
 have
 varying


opinions,
 but
 South
 Park
 has
 been


deranged
 this
 season.
 I
 mean,
 they
 have


gone
 full
 boore
 in
 attacking
 him
 like
 to


a
 level
 that
 I
 wouldn't
 feel
 comfortable


explaining
 the
 details
 of
 it.
 Uh,
 here.


>> Not
 in
 a
 family
 podcast.


>> Not
 in
 a
 family
 podcast.


But
 but
 even


>> President
 Trump
 has
 a
 thick
 skin
 on


these
 things.
 We
 did
 have
 one
 weird


thing
 that
 occurred.
 I
 think
 it
 was


before
 your
 time,
 the
 Jimmy
 Kimmel,


>> Charlie
 Kirk
 Kurfluffle,
 but
 even
 that


it
 seemed
 David
 um
 President
 Trump
 and


the
 administration
 and
 Brendan
 Carr


friend
 of
 the
 pod
 who's
 been
 on
 a
 couple


times
 um
 kind
 of
 rethought
 that
 one.


Yeah.


>> Well,
 Jimmy
 Kimmel
 was
 back
 in
 the
 air


within
 was
 it
 like
 two
 or
 three
 nights.


So
 yeah,
 I
 mean
 there's
 no
 real


censorship
 there.
 In
 that
 case,
 it
 was


the
 network
 affiliates
 who
 were
 upset


because
 he
 because
 Jimmy
 Kimmel
 said


something
 untrue
 and
 malicious
 and


outrageous.
 So
 in
 any
 event,
 this
 is


>> the
 heat
 of
 the
 moment
 with
 after
 kind


of
 worked
 itself
 out.
 There
 was
 no
 like


government
 censorship.


>> Brendan
 probably
 shouldn't
 have
 said


what
 he
 said
 in
 my
 estimation.


>> Anyway,
 in
 any
 event,
 there
 was
 no


government
 censorship.
 That's
 the
 bottom


line.
 Um
 yeah,
 I
 think
 it
 is
 disturbing


that
 uh
 countries
 that
 we
 see
 as
 our


closest
 allies
 that
 share
 similar
 values


that
 are
 part
 of
 the
 same
 western


culture
 and
 history
 are
 moving
 in
 this


direction
 of
 more
 and
 more
 censorship
 is


disturbing
 and
 I'm
 glad
 to
 see
 that
 um


under
 President
 Trump
 the
 Department
 of


State
 is
 pushing
 back
 on
 this.
 I
 think


Sarah
 the
 work
 that
 you're
 doing
 and


Secretary
 Rubio
 extremely
 important.
 So


I
 think
 you're
 making
 a
 huge
 difference.


I
 think
 we
 have
 to
 use
 the
 tools
 that
 we


have
 whether
 they're
 tools
 on
 trade
 or


the
 denial
 of
 visas
 or
 um
 expressing


condemnation
 to
 push
 back
 on
 this
 as
 we


you
 know
 as
 we
 will
 as
 we
 can.


>> Let's
 talk
 about
 some
 of
 the
 new
 issues.


Uh
 AI
 uh
 it
 was
 pretty
 obvious
 but
 18


months
 ago
 when
 you
 saw
 a
 deep
 fake
 it


just
 didn't
 pass
 the
 uncanny
 valley.
 uh


Grock
 images
 uh
 Nano
 Banana
 from
 our


friends
 at
 Google.
 I
 mean
 these
 things


now
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 flipping
 by
 very


quickly
 you
 could
 make
 a
 mistake.
 This


also
 uh
 in
 terms
 of
 censorship
 we
 have


significant
 protections
 in
 the
 United


States
 for
 say
 cartoonists
 as
 do
 the


French
 and


>> they're
 mocking
 public
 figures.
 How
 is


it
 different
 when
 you're
 mocking
 public


figures,
 uh,
 presidents,
 prime


ministers,
 cabinet
 members,


but
 the
 public
 can't
 tell?
 Cuz
 this
 is


new,


>> right?
 I
 think
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 really


interesting
 question
 and
 it's
 our


privilege
 to
 be
 at
 this
 new


technological
 frontier
 where
 these
 new


questions
 arise.
 U,
 I'm
 glad
 you


mentioned
 cartoonists.
 So,
 after
 Charlie


Kirk
 was
 murdered
 and
 I
 knew
 him,
 I


represented
 him
 on
 some
 First
 Amendment


issues
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 I
 saw


Americans
 walking
 around
 in
 an
 old


t-shirt
 from
 10
 years
 ago
 and
 that


t-shirt
 said
 just
 sweet
 Charlie.
 Uh


because
 that
 was
 a
 t-shirt
 we
 bought


when
 free
 speech
 in
 France
 was
 under


threat
 and
 French
 people
 stood
 up
 for


it.
 The
 Charlie
 Hepto
 cartoonists
 were


bombed.
 They
 were
 murdered.
 Yeah.


>> Um
 for
 saying
 things
 that
 offended


religious
 zealots.
 And
 I
 think
 you
 know


it's
 a
 different
 kind
 of
 religious


zealatry
 to
 not
 want
 to
 allow
 any


descent
 online.
 And
 thinking
 back
 on


that
 episode
 and
 how
 European
 consensus


on
 free
 speech
 might
 have
 shifted
 since


then
 is
 really
 sobering.
 But
 I
 think


America
 we
 take
 pride
 in
 being
 the
 kind


of
 civilization
 where
 Charlie
 Kirk
 and


Charlie
 Hebdo
 can
 both
 speak.
 I
 think


making
 fun
 of
 public
 officials.
 You
 know


pointing
 out
 when
 the
 emperor
 has
 no


clothes
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 essential


things
 you
 can
 do
 in
 a
 democracy.
 If
 you


believe
 in
 self-governance,
 you
 have
 to


believe
 in
 that.
 And
 what's
 interesting


about
 a
 deep
 fake
 is
 that
 the
 point
 of


parody
 is
 that
 you
 can
 tell
 that
 it's


parody.
 But
 if
 you're
 depicting
 a
 public


official
 falsely
 in
 a
 way
 that
 people


can't
 tell
 as
 a
 satirical
 or
 um


non-authentic
 depiction,
 then
 the
 parody


tension
 really
 isn't
 there.
 And
 what
 I


would
 say
 though
 is
 whenever
 whenever
 we


reach
 a
 new
 technological
 frontier,


there's
 a
 temptation
 to
 just
 enact
 a


flurry
 of
 new
 regulations.
 And
 if
 we


look
 back
 over
 history
 at
 other


frontiers
 that
 have
 caused
 similar


instability,
 like
 the
 invention
 of
 the


printing
 press,
 people
 thought
 that
 was


the
 end
 of
 the
 world.
 The
 invention
 of


the
 telegraph,
 there
 were
 worries
 about


disinformation
 and
 attention
 span.
 The


invention
 of
 the
 film
 strip,
 people


thought
 the
 train
 was
 coming
 at
 them


through
 the
 screen.


The
 the
 the
 impulse
 to
 restrain
 that


deal,
 to
 regulate,
 and
 to
 allow
 people


to
 adapt
 and
 to
 give
 freedom
 the
 benefit


of
 the
 doubt,
 that
 impulse
 tends
 to
 be


vindicated
 over
 time.
 When
 it
 comes
 to


deep
 fakes,
 I
 think
 we
 have
 in
 in


America
 and
 in
 Europe
 strong
 legal


remedies
 against
 defamation.
 So
 if


someone
 creates
 an
 image
 of
 a
 public


figure
 that
 is
 false
 and
 people
 are


believing
 that
 image
 and
 a
 reasonable


viewer
 would
 believe
 that
 that
 person


engaged
 in
 that
 action,
 you
 can
 already


sue
 for
 defamation,


>> right?


>> And
 that
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 that


>> and
 we
 have
 child
 protection
 and


underage
 laws.
 Those
 are
 very
 strong.


Yes.
 The
 thing
 is
 just
 because
 you
 don't


have
 AI
 specific
 laws
 doesn't
 mean
 that


you
 can
 do
 whatever
 you
 want
 with
 AI,


you
 could
 still
 use
 AI
 as
 a
 tool
 to
 then


break
 the
 law
 and
 be
 prosecuted.


>> I
 mean,
 if
 you
 engage
 in
 cyber
 hacking,


for
 example,


>> and
 you
 use
 AI
 to
 do
 it,
 you're
 guilty


of
 of
 a
 cyber
 crime.


>> Yeah.
 So
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 like


that
 where
 uh
 there
 are
 plenty
 of


existing
 laws
 that
 apply
 to
 AI
 and
 we


should
 just
 think
 about
 using
 all
 of


those
 before
 you
 start
 then
 creating
 a


bunch
 of
 AI
 specific.


>> Yeah.
 those
 didn't
 cover
 it


>> then
 there
 would
 be
 hey
 maybe
 we
 need
 to


have
 a
 thoughtful
 discussion


>> because
 you
 know
 I'm
 trying
 to
 think
 of


an
 edge
 case
 here
 but


>> um
 for
 cyber
 security
 it's
 even
 hard
 to


do
 like
 using
 voice
 clones
 it's
 just


fraud
 you
 know
 it's


>> wire
 fraud
 you
 know


>> and
 it
 might
 be
 that
 it
 you
 use
 the


existing
 fraud
 statute
 but
 there
 are


little
 regulatory
 tweaks
 you
 can
 make


the
 make
 the
 fraud
 easier
 to
 detect
 so


one
 approach
 which
 I
 don't
 think
 is


always
 correct
 but
 it
 it
 exemplifies
 one


direction
 of
 thinking
 is
 maybe
 there's


water
 marking
 or
 something
 on
 some
 AI


images
 that
 would
 mitigate
 tort


liability
 for
 some
 of
 the
 providers.
 Um


or
 when
 we
 got
 when
 we
 when
 we
 invented


capital
 markets
 on
 a
 mass
 scale,
 right?


We
 had
 our
 old
 laws
 against
 fraud,
 but


we
 kind
 of
 made
 some
 more
 fine
 grain


securities
 regulations
 like
 now
 you
 have


to
 uh
 file
 a
 certain
 disclosure
 annually


with
 your
 earnings
 and
 whatnot.
 And
 we


didn't
 fundamentally
 change
 how
 we


treated
 false
 information.
 we
 just


developed
 some
 slightly
 more
 fine-tuned


devices.
 But
 when
 I
 say
 fine-tuned,
 I


think
 I
 think
 that's
 an
 important
 piece


of
 guidance.
 You
 don't
 just
 go
 crazy
 and


try
 to
 put
 the
 technological
 innovation


back
 in
 the
 bottle,
 especially
 when,
 you


know,
 we
 have
 foreign
 policy
 rivals
 like


China
 that
 are
 developing
 AI
 at
 um
 an


aggressive
 pace.
 And
 if
 we
 if
 we
 cocoon


ourselves
 in
 safety,
 we
 hurt
 our


standing
 in
 that
 race.
 So
 where
 sir,


where
 do
 you
 think
 this
 relationship


between
 the
 US
 and
 EU
 is
 now
 headed
 on


this
 topic
 of
 free
 speech?
 I
 mean
 there


does
 seem
 to
 be
 a
 fundamental


divergence.
 Um
 do
 you
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 the


conversations
 that
 you're
 having,
 but
 do


you
 think
 this
 gets
 worked
 out
 or
 do
 you


think
 the
 divide
 gets
 greater?
 What
 like


where's
 this
 headed?
 So
 before
 uh


President
 Trump
 and
 Secretary
 Rubio
 did


me
 the
 honor
 of
 this
 appointment,
 I
 was


a
 litigator
 and
 it
 was
 my
 job
 to
 fight.


And
 now
 I'm
 a
 diplomat.
 So
 it
 is
 my
 job


to
 be
 diplomatic.
 And
 in
 that
 spirit,
 I


would
 like
 to
 sound
 a
 uh
 gong
 of


optimism.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 ordinary


Europeans
 are
 not
 comfortable
 with


comedians
 getting
 dragged
 out
 of
 the


airport,
 just
 like
 Europeans
 weren't


comfortable
 with
 comedians
 getting


murdered
 who
 are
 publishing
 offensive


cartoons.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at
 polls
 in


Europe,
 I
 think
 you
 see
 some
 of
 the


sentiment.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 things


are
 going.
 I
 can't
 promise
 in
 a
 panacea,


but
 I
 will
 say
 that
 I've
 had
 productive


conversations
 and
 hope
 that
 I'll
 have


more.
 I
 mean,
 if
 it
 does
 become
 more


acute,
 is
 Europe
 prepared
 for
 all
 the


American
 social
 networks
 to
 be
 turned


off
 and
 blocked
 by
 IP
 address
 because
 we


really
 don't
 need
 the
 money
 like
 these


platforms.
 It's
 nice
 to
 make
 money
 in


Europe,
 but
 maybe
 it's
 time


>> or
 would
 the
 European
 or
 would
 various


European
 countries
 demand
 their
 own


version?
 You
 know,
 would
 there
 be
 a
 UK


specific
 version
 of
 X?
 Is
 that
 where


this
 would
 be
 headed


>> to
 an
 extent?
 because
 you
 know
 one
 way


to
 resolve
 the
 transnational
 issue
 is


geoencing.
 Now
 I
 think
 I
 I
 understand


that
 some
 of
 the
 UK
 enforcement
 actions


geofencing
 has
 not
 been
 enough
 which
 is


pretty
 ridiculous
 but
 you're
 essentially


>> saying
 that's
 not
 enough
 for
 them.


>> Yeah.
 Like
 there's
 there's
 a
 there's
 a


there's
 a
 small
 American
 website
 and
 I


can't
 recall
 the
 name
 of
 it
 that
 offcom


has
 sued
 and
 that
 website
 responded
 well


we've
 geoenced
 we've
 blocked
 UK
 IPs
 so


you
 should
 have
 nothing
 to
 say
 about
 the


content
 on
 our
 website
 but
 offcom
 is


still
 going.


>> Yeah,
 they
 should
 be
 good.
 But
 those


people
 then
 chose
 their
 citizens
 chose


to
 get
 a
 VPN.
 Yes,
 that's
 well
 that's


>> which
 cost
 30
 bucks
 a
 year
 and
 then
 you


can
 make
 your
 own
 decision


>> which
 is
 what
 the
 people
 of
 Iran
 are


doing
 too.
 So


>> um
 but
 I
 think
 I
 think
 you
 know
 you


mention
 um
 like
 fire
 like
 blocking
 by
 IP


address.
 I
 think
 some
 countries
 that


just
 where
 the
 people
 where
 they
 don't


have
 that
 Charlie
 Hubo
 tradition
 like


countries
 like
 Russia
 or
 China
 they
 just


admit
 that
 they
 are
 censurious
 societies


and
 they
 just
 block
 these
 websites
 when


you
 have


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 the
 great
 in
 China
 we
 have


the
 great
 firewall
 which
 we're
 not


trying
 to
 take
 down.
 If
 you
 want
 to


>> but
 could
 that
 happen?
 Could
 the
 UK
 put


up
 a
 great
 firewall
 and
 just
 say
 that


>> you
 know
 we're
 black
 outside
 world.


>> We
 call
 your
 bluff.


>> I
 think
 it's
 technologically
 it's


technologically
 feasible
 to
 a
 point.


There
 are
 circumventions
 but
 it
 is
 not


politically
 feasible
 because
 British


people
 want
 to
 be
 free.
 And
 I
 think
 if


Kier
 Starmer
 said
 we're
 putting
 up
 a


great
 firewall
 and
 you're
 not
 allowed
 to


access
 any
 American
 social
 media


anymore,
 he'd
 be
 out
 of
 office.


>> Right?
 So
 that
 is
 their
 right,
 but
 they


don't
 want
 to
 do
 that
 because
 it
 would


be
 too
 obvious
 what
 they're
 doing.
 And


so
 therefore,


>> they
 want
 to
 do
 the
 fines.
 They
 want


>> to
 be
 fines
 and
 just
 have
 it
 be
 more


subtle.
 And
 we're
 pushing
 back
 saying,


"No,
 you
 can't
 do
 that."


>> Yeah.
 Good
 luck
 doing
 that
 against
 Elon.


He's
 pretty
 principal
 disc.
 I
 think
 he


can
 pay
 for
 the
 speeding
 ticket.
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 problem.
 And
 I


would
 say
 President
 Trump
 because
 I
 I
 do


think
 that
 that
 President
 Trump's


election
 definitely
 changed
 the


direction
 of
 free
 speech
 in
 the
 United


States,
 never
 mind
 the
 rest
 of
 the


world,
 because
 I
 think
 under
 the
 Biden


administration,
 we
 now
 know
 from
 cases


like
 Biden
 v.
 Missouri
 and
 then
 also
 uh


you
 know
 what
 was
 released
 in
 the


Twitter
 files
 and
 then
 since
 then
 even


more
 disclosure
 that's
 come
 out
 that
 the


Biden
 administration
 was
 pressuring


social
 networks
 to
 engage
 in
 censorship.


>> David,
 we
 did
 discuss
 this.
 You
 could


bring
 up
 Biden
 for
 all
 of
 2025,
 but
 when


2026
 came
 around,
 you
 had
 to
 I'm


recounting
 I'm
 recounting
 what
 was


happening
 for
 several
 years
 and


President
 Trump
 changed
 that
 direction.


>> Absolutely.


>> And
 so
 if
 it
 weren't
 for
 that,
 I
 think


we'd
 still
 be
 on
 a
 censorship.


>> If
 it
 was
 up
 to
 Zuckerberg,
 he
 would


have
 continued
 to
 do
 it
 under
 Kamla.
 He


did
 it
 with
 no
 problem
 under
 Biden.
 He's


a
 weather
 vein.
 His
 entire
 position
 is


based
 on
 what
 makes
 the
 system
 grow.


>> Look,
 I
 think
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 these


>> I
 don't
 have
 any
 personal
 feelings
 on


it.
 I
 think
 I
 think
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the


the
 tech
 companies,
 there's
 let's
 say
 a


range
 of
 courage.


>> Yes.


>> And
 so
 I'd
 say
 Elon
 is
 an
 outlier
 in


terms
 of
 willing
 to
 stand
 up
 Yeah.
 to


the
 government
 in
 terms
 of
 protecting


free
 speech
 and
 there's
 others
 who
 sort


of
 just
 kind
 of
 more
 blow
 with
 the
 wind


and
 do
 whatever
 the
 government
 is
 sort


of
 um
 suggesting.
 But
 demanding,
 but
 it


was
 wrong.
 It
 was
 wrong
 for
 the


government
 to
 be
 doing
 that
 particularly


in
 the
 US
 where
 you
 have
 a
 first


amendment.
 But
 let
 me


>> and
 to
 catch
 people
 up,
 we
 literally
 had


our
 FBI
 putting
 pressure
 on
 our
 own
 tech


companies
 to
 say
 we
 don't
 like
 the
 the


tone
 of
 these
 tweets,
 the
 tone
 of
 these


posts
 we
 think
 are
 damaging,
 but
 we


would
 have
 never
 gotten
 to
 the
 bottom
 of


CO
 and
 if
 it
 actually
 we
 should
 all
 be


taking
 mysterious,
 you
 know,


experimental
 vaccines.
 I
 took
 it.
 I'm


okay.
 But
 like
 the
 folks
 who
 were


saying,
 "Hey,
 maybe
 we
 don't
 need
 this.


Maybe
 we
 don't
 need
 to
 give
 it
 to
 kids.


They
 don't
 see
 that
 whole
 discussion
 was


shut
 down
 by
 the
 Biden
 administration.


Now
 you
 got
 me
 doing
 it


>> irrefutably
 and
 the
 the
 pretext
 for
 some


of
 this
 was
 disinformation
 a
 term
 that


was
 really
 distended
 to
 encompass
 and
 if


you
 read
 the
 white
 papers
 put
 out
 by


these
 disinformation
 NGOs
 they
 will


admit
 yeah
 the
 information
 can
 be
 true


but
 if
 it
 promotes
 an
 adverse
 narrative


we
 don't
 like
 it
 and
 that's
 such
 an


Orwellian
 adverse
 narative


misinformation.
 No,
 not
 misinformation.


>> There's
 there's
 misinformation
 and


disinformation.
 And
 the
 way
 some
 people


defined
 these
 was
 misinformation
 is


false
 and
 disinformation
 is
 bad.
 And
 if


disinformation
 pollutes
 your
 democracy,


the
 wrong
 candidate
 right
 might
 win.
 I


think
 is
 really
 the
 impulse.
 But
 we
 had


information
 suppressed
 under
 opaces
 of


combating
 disinformation.
 That
 turned


out
 to
 be
 true.
 So
 things
 that
 were


suppressed
 included
 the
 assertion
 that


the
 vaccine
 did
 not
 completely
 prevent


transmission.
 That
 turned
 out
 to
 be


true.
 It
 it
 mitigated
 transmission


significantly,
 but
 it
 was
 not
 a


sterilizing
 vaccine.
 Another
 thing
 that


was
 suppressed,


>> which
 by
 the
 way
 is
 why
 a
 lot
 of
 people


took
 it.
 They
 didn't
 want
 they
 wanted
 to


be
 a
 blocker
 in
 the
 system,
 so
 like
 it's


my
 social
 obligation
 to
 do
 it.


>> And
 if
 had
 given
 the
 choice,
 they
 might


not
 have.


>> And
 another
 thing
 that
 was
 suppressed


that
 was
 suppressed
 was
 the
 assessment


that
 the
 virus
 might
 have
 leaked
 from
 a


lab.
 And
 we
 now
 know
 that
 was
 that
 was


the
 same
 assessment
 of
 a
 House
 committee


and
 the
 CIA.
 So
 the
 government
 thinks


the
 virus,
 they're
 not
 sure,
 but
 it


might
 have
 leaked
 from
 a
 lab
 more
 likely


than
 not.
 and
 you're
 you're
 reaching
 out


to
 Twitter,
 to
 Facebook,
 to
 Instagram


saying,
 "Hey,
 you
 know,
 we
 can't
 force


you
 to
 take
 these
 posts
 down
 under
 the


First
 Amendment,
 but
 we'd
 really


appreciate
 if
 you
 did.
 And
 if
 you
 want


to
 stay
 in
 our
 good
 graces,
 you
 should."


>> Which
 is
 a
 long
 way
 of
 saying
 we
 all


need
 to
 be
 vigilant
 about
 it
 in
 the


United
 States,
 internationally.
 If


you're
 not
 vigilant
 about
 free
 speech,


there
 are
 people
 who
 will
 take
 it
 away.


>> Yes.
 And
 let
 me
 let
 me
 ask
 a
 question


about
 that.
 So,
 you
 mentioned
 um


organizations
 or
 NOS's
 who
 are
 kind
 of


instigating.
 They're
 like
 j
 you
 know,


jinning
 up
 these
 regulators.
 They're


showing
 them
 cases.
 What
 about
 this?


What
 about
 this?
 What
 about
 that?
 I'm


curious,
 and
 I
 think
 you've
 called
 this


a
 censorship
 industrial
 complex.
 Could


you
 just
 explain
 what
 this
 thing
 is?
 And


do
 you
 think
 that
 I
 know
 that
 some
 of


these
 groups
 are
 in
 the
 US,
 not
 just


Europe?
 In
 fact,
 they
 mostly
 might
 be
 in


the
 US.
 And
 what
 I'm
 wondering
 is,
 are


they
 going
 to
 the
 European
 regulators
 as


an
 end
 run
 around
 the
 First
 Amendment
 in


the
 US
 because
 they
 can
 get
 European


regulators
 to
 censor
 material
 that


otherwise
 could
 not
 be
 censored
 in
 the


US?
 I
 mean,
 it's
 a
 great
 question,
 but


um
 it's
 a
 question
 we
 don't
 even
 need
 to


ask
 because
 we
 know
 the
 answer,
 and
 the


answer
 is
 yes.
 So,
 we
 have
 emails
 that


have
 leaked
 from
 some
 of
 these
 NOS's.


So,
 um
 one
 of
 them,
 the
 Center
 for


Countering
 Digital
 Hate,
 which
 is
 a


British
 NGO
 whose
 leader
 was
 the
 target


of
 um
 some
 of
 our
 visa
 sanctions.
 There


are
 emails
 exchanged
 with
 with


Democratic
 politicians
 in
 the
 United


States,
 and
 with
 politicians
 now
 very


close
 to
 Kier
 Stormer
 saying
 um
 our


number
 one
 priority
 should
 be
 to
 kill


Musk's
 Twitter.
 So,
 kill
 an
 American


company,
 right?
 um
 in
 order
 to
 suppress


American
 political
 speech
 and
 our
 second


priority
 is
 to
 instigate
 UK
 and
 EU


regulatory
 action.
 So
 this
 is
 an
 entity


taking
 government
 money
 to
 get
 foreign


governments
 to
 come
 after
 American


businesses
 and
 this
 whole
 fact
 pattern


where
 these
 where
 these
 American
 NOS's


were
 working
 with
 the
 American


government
 to
 send
 kind
 of
 forceful
 they


allege
 not
 technically
 coercive
 emails


to
 to
 Twitter
 and
 Meta.
 um
 that
 was
 an


attempt
 by
 these
 activists
 to
 replicate


sort
 of
 the
 EU
 DSA
 in
 a
 way
 that
 would


kind
 of
 dodge
 the
 American
 first


amendment.
 So
 the
 EUDSA
 requires
 that


member
 states
 designate
 NOS's
 as


so-called
 trusted
 flaggers.
 Meaning
 this


this
 organization
 its
 job
 is
 to
 sit
 on


Twitter,
 look
 for
 offending
 tweets
 that


might
 be
 hateful
 or
 whatever
 and
 report


them
 to
 Twitter.
 and
 they
 get
 a


privileged
 reporting
 channel
 and
 the


company's
 required
 to
 give
 th
 give
 those


reports
 first
 trunch
 priority.
 If
 you


look
 at
 what
 was
 happening
 under
 Biden,


it
 was
 a
 very
 similar
 system.
 These


government
 agencies
 would
 arrange
 first


trunch
 priority
 for
 these
 reports
 and


some
 of
 what
 was
 put
 into
 those


channels.
 The
 reports
 were
 technically


made
 by
 NOS's.
 You
 also
 had
 you
 know
 the


the
 upside
 one
 of
 the
 small
 upsides
 of


co
 if
 you
 care
 about
 government


transparency
 is
 everyone
 was
 holding


their
 meetings
 on
 video.
 And
 so
 you
 have


these
 videos
 of
 these
 Zoom
 meetings
 with


government
 operatives
 saying,
 you
 know,


we
 couldn't
 do
 this
 under
 the
 First


Amendment.
 But
 fortunately,
 this
 NGO
 on


this
 call
 with
 us
 is
 going
 to
 do
 it


instead.


>> Yeah.
 And
 they
 have
 ways
 of
 pressuring


people,
 which
 leads
 to
 my
 final


questions
 for
 you,
 which
 is
 there
 are


firms
 that
 would,
 it
 actually
 started
 in


the
 conservative
 space
 and
 moved
 to
 the


liberal.
 Let's
 try
 to
 get
 advertisers
 to


cancel
 on
 this
 program.
 They
 went
 after


Howard
 Stern
 and
 they
 went
 after
 the


liberals
 first.
 Then
 they
 went
 after
 the


conservatives.
 let's
 get
 uh
 you
 know


Rush
 Limbaugh's
 advertisers
 to
 cancel.


Oh
 my
 god,
 he
 said
 these
 incendiary


things
 yada
 yada.
 Um
 but
 we
 had
 a
 even


more
 pernitious
 one
 which
 is
 people


started
 to
 say
 well
 hey
 you're


Cloudflare.
 Hey
 you're
 Amazon.
 Uh
 hey


you're
 PayPal.
 Hey
 you're
 Stripe.


>> We're
 going
 to
 go
 after
 you
 and
 make


sure
 that
 we
 shame
 slash
 pressure
 you


>> sometimes
 behind
 the
 scenes
 to
 debank


and
 to
 demonetize.
 YouTube
 got
 pulled


into
 this
 as
 well,
 like
 we're
 going
 to


shadowban
 your
 videos.
 They
 started


labeling
 all-in
 videos
 because
 we
 had


conversations
 with
 scientists


>> about
 co
 okay
 uh
 labeling
 also


suppressed
 I
 think.
 So
 what
 are
 your


thoughts
 on
 that
 which
 seems
 even
 more


pernitious
 because
 if
 you
 take
 away
 a


person's
 ability
 to
 monetize
 it,
 how
 do


they
 scale
 right


>> that?
 So
 there's
 been
 one
 successful


Supreme
 Court
 case
 in
 US
 history
 on


viewpointbased
 debanking
 and
 that
 was
 my


case
 um
 which
 we
 won
 and
 that
 was
 called


NRA
 versus
 VUO
 and
 the
 way
 we
 got
 that


into
 court
 was
 you
 had
 you
 had
 the
 New


York
 financial
 regulator
 um
 per
 the
 you


know
 per
 the
 pleadings
 literally


reaching
 out
 to
 financial
 institutions


saying
 you
 know
 it
 would
 really
 be


better
 for
 your
 enterprise
 risk


management
 framework
 if
 you
 didn't
 do
 if


you
 didn't
 do
 business
 with
 any
 proun


group


>> enterprise
 riskmanagement
 framework.
 So


you
 have
 all
 these
 professionals
 and
 you


guys
 have
 you
 know
 been
 in
 finance
 and


you
 know
 this
 um
 like
 these
 this
 these


bureaucracies
 hired
 within
 financial


institutions
 to
 ensure
 compliance
 with


all
 these
 regulations
 and
 so
 they
 have


these
 elaborate
 risk
 management


protocols
 and
 this
 gets
 a
 bit
 into
 the


weeds
 but
 there's
 this
 thing
 in
 finance


called
 reputational
 risk
 and
 that's


supposed
 to
 be
 the
 reputation
 of
 a
 bank


for
 safety
 solveny
 and
 soundness.
 You


don't
 want
 to
 run
 on
 the
 bank
 if


everyone
 thinks
 the
 bank
 might
 fail.


That's
 bad
 for
 the
 system.
 But
 there's


this
 ESG
 movement
 to
 expand
 the
 concept


of
 reputational
 risk
 to
 include
 things


like
 do
 you
 have
 a
 reputation
 for


letting
 naughty
 disfavored
 speakers
 have


bank
 accounts
 and
 that
 came
 up
 in
 the


NRA
 case.
 Supreme
 Court
 says
 government


is
 not
 allowed
 to
 do
 that.
 Even
 though


the
 government,
 you
 know,
 our
 first


amendment
 says
 Congress
 shall
 make
 no


law,
 you
 know,
 restricting
 the
 freedom


of
 speech.
 This
 wasn't
 Congress
 making
 a


law
 restricting
 their
 freedom
 of
 speech,


but
 it
 was
 a
 government
 entity
 uh


adversely
 applying
 regulations
 to
 choke


off
 certain
 viewpoints.
 And
 they
 were


applying
 it
 instead
 of
 going
 directly
 to


the
 guy
 saying
 the
 thing
 you
 don't
 like,


they're
 putting
 pressure
 on
 this
 risk


averse
 middleman,
 this
 bank.
 And
 the
 the


the
 debanking
 and
 deplatforming
 is


insidious
 for
 exactly
 that
 reason.
 When


you
 have
 a
 risk
 averse
 middleman
 like
 a


financial
 institution,


>> it's
 almost
 like
 they
 designed
 it
 that


way.


>> Yeah.
 they
 they
 they
 they
 don't
 have


skin
 in
 the
 game
 with
 respect.
 They


don't
 believe
 in
 your
 speech
 the
 way
 you


do.
 They
 have
 their
 in-house
 counsel


telling
 them
 that
 this
 is
 going
 to
 piss


off
 the
 financial
 regulator.
 So,
 it's


easier
 to
 take
 it
 down.
 And
 my
 office
 is


very


>> So,
 that's
 a
 common
 theme
 is
 that
 when


the
 government
 can't
 do
 it
 directly


because
 it'
 be
 a
 violation
 of
 the
 first


amendment,
 they
 use
 an
 intermediary
 to


do
 it.


>> So,
 you
 get
 the
 bank
 to
 debank
 someone


or
 you
 get
 an
 NGO,


>> Dark
 NGO,


>> which
 is
 really
 a
 government


organization
 because
 it's
 funded
 by
 the


government,
 but
 they
 call
 themselves


non-government.
 So
 they
 they
 do
 the


quote
 unquote
 factchecking.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 know,
 or
 um
 you
 know,
 you
 get
 one
 of


these
 other
 cases
 where
 um
 you
 know,
 the


the
 this
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 overt,


but
 where
 the
 FBI
 through
 the
 Biden


administration
 is
 then
 putting
 pressure


on
 the
 social
 networks.
 In
 any
 event,


you
 get,
 like
 you
 said,
 a
 middleman
 to


do
 the
 dirty
 work
 because
 the
 government


can't
 do
 it
 directly


>> and
 to
 do
 it
 in
 a
 really
 nefarious


>> Yes.


>> way
 that's
 hard
 to
 detect.
 Yes.
 It's


like
 it'd
 be
 a
 shame
 if
 we
 blocked
 a


merger.
 Like
 they
 were
 very
 Zuckerberg's


a
 pragmatist.
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 at
 him


again.
 Like
 he
 likes
 to
 buy
 things.
 And


if
 the
 FBI
 is
 calling
 you
 and
 you've
 got


to
 get
 something
 through
 the
 FTC
 next,


you're
 going
 to
 try
 to
 make
 nice,
 right?


And
 that
 is
 the
 risk
 of
 giving
 any


regulator
 kind
 of
 a
 capricious
 cudgel


over
 the
 internet
 is
 even
 if
 the
 even
 if


the
 regulation
 isn't
 explicitly


speechbased
 is
 just
 you
 can
 only
 do
 your


merger
 if
 this
 guy
 likes
 likes
 the
 look


of
 the
 merger
 then
 companies
 are
 going


to
 vi
 to
 impress
 that
 regulator
 that
 I


think
 a
 bit
 of
 that
 was
 going
 on
 frankly


with
 the
 Jimmy
 Kimmel
 thing.
 um
 because


you
 had
 this
 this
 this
 merger
 in
 the


works,
 this
 Techno
 merger
 that
 they


tried
 to
 complete
 under
 the
 Biden


administration
 and
 my
 friends
 in
 telecom


tell
 me
 that
 when
 Techno
 was
 trying
 to


sell
 itself
 during
 the
 Biden


administration,
 it
 went
 out
 of
 its
 way


to
 show
 the
 regulator
 how
 woke
 it
 was.


And
 so
 now
 it
 has
 an
 incentive
 to
 show


the
 administration
 that
 it's
 magal
 lined


and
 that's
 what
 happens
 when
 you
 give
 a


regulator
 a
 large
 cudgel.
 Now
 I
 want
 to


say
 something
 about
 labeling.
 So


>> labeling
 videos
 sounds
 oh
 it's
 just


transparency.
 What
 could
 be
 wrong
 with


that?
 people
 people
 should
 know
 if
 fact


checkers
 think
 that
 something
 is
 wrong


and
 I
 think
 my
 office's
 approach
 on
 that


is
 it
 depends
 on
 who's
 putting
 the
 label


on
 there
 and
 for
 what
 purpose
 so
 a
 lot


of
 these
 disinformation
 NOS's
 it
 was


almost
 like
 mart
 it
 was
 almost
 like
 the


red
 scare
 they
 would
 make
 a
 list
 of


outlets
 that
 were
 spreading


disinformation
 but
 they
 wouldn't
 just


publish
 that
 list
 they
 would
 send
 it


around
 to
 the
 credit
 card
 companies
 the


payment
 processors
 and
 suggest
 with
 with


kind
 of
 an
 implicit
 government


impromater
 because
 they're
 all


government
 funded
 as
 David
 very
 very


relevantly
 points
 out
 like
 you
 know
 you


guys
 really
 shouldn't
 be
 funding
 these


websites
 and
 the
 websites
 would
 never


know
 why
 and
 the
 viewer
 would
 never
 know


why.
 I
 think
 a
 type
 of
 labeling
 that's


really
 good
 is
 the
 type
 exemplified
 by


community
 notes
 on
 X
 where
 I
 can
 read


the
 tweet
 and
 then
 I
 can
 see
 what
 the


community
 notes
 say
 about
 it
 and
 you
 can


see
 a
 ranking
 of
 the
 community
 total


it's
 been
 a
 total
 game
 changer.
 I


remember
 when
 they
 were
 doing


factchecking
 and
 the
 facteing
 was
 so
 bad


cuz
 the
 fact
 checkers
 were
 biased
 or


sometimes
 it
 just
 wasn't
 good
 quality


control
 but
 the
 community
 note
 thing
 has


like
 really
 worked
 and
 you'll
 see
 that


when
 someone
 posts
 something
 that's


truly
 misinformation
 like
 it's
 a
 fake


image
 or
 a
 fake
 article
 or
 something
 it


always
 gets
 caught
 amount
 of
 time
 and


then
 you
 get
 notified


>> you
 get
 a
 if
 you
 like
 have
 you
 noticed


this
 if
 you
 like
 it'll
 come
 circle
 back


>> and
 then
 it
 gets
 community
 noted
 I
 get
 a


notification
 then
 I
 feel
 like
 an
 idiot


that
 oh
 I
 got


that.
 But
 you
 know
 what?
 People
 will


drag
 social
 media
 for,
 you
 know,
 the


fakes
 or
 whatever.
 But
 I
 never
 get


notified
 when
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 makes
 a


mistake
 and
 post
 a
 correction
 on
 page


43.
 They
 never
 notify
 anybody
 about


that.
 They
 bury
 that
 on
 the
 last
 page.


So
 I
 still
 think
 social
 media
 is
 by
 far


the
 best.


>> Were
 you
 in
 the
 meeting
 for
 accuracy?


Were
 you
 in
 the
 meeting
 when


>> they
 were
 deciding
 community
 notes
 or


not?
 And
 Elon
 was
 like,
 "Tell
 me
 about


it."
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Elon,
 I
 think
 this


is
 really
 interesting.
 You
 should


>> Yeah.
 double
 click
 on
 it
 because
 it's


actually
 working.
 Um,
 and
 he
 looked
 at


it,
 he
 immediately
 understood
 the


algorithm
 and
 he
 said,
 "Keep
 the
 group."


>> Yeah,


>> that
 group
 stays.


>> And
 you
 know what's
 the
 genius
 of
 that


algorithm
 is
 the
 community
 only
 gets


promoted
 if
 users
 who
 usually
 disagree


agree
 that
 that
 notice


>> they
 look
 for
 consensus
 amongst
 rivals.


>> Yes.


>> Which
 is
 a
 fascinating
 uh


>> the
 I'll
 tell
 you
 the
 other
 game
 changer


um
 on
 X
 has
 been
 Grock
 cuz
 you
 can
 just


go
 at
 Grock
 what's
 the
 truth?
 Yeah.


>> And
 you
 won't
 necessarily
 always
 agree


with
 Guac.
 I'm
 not
 saying
 it's
 perfect,


but
 it's
 pretty
 darn
 good.


>> It's
 trending
 in
 the
 right
 direction.


>> It's
 I
 mean,
 it's
 really
 good
 on
 the


whole.
 And
 yeah,
 I
 mean,
 it
 does
 a


really
 good
 job
 facteing,
 too.
 So,
 we


don't
 really
 need
 these
 bureaucrats
 and


politicians
 and
 regulators
 telling
 us


what's
 true
 or
 not.
 We
 have
 community


notes.
 We
 have
 AI
 now.
 You've
 got
 other


users


>> and
 you
 can
 file
 a
 lawsuit
 if
 you
 feel


you've
 been
 defamed.
 Like,
 this
 exists


in
 the
 United
 States.


>> Exactly.


>> As
 a
 concept.
 Uh,
 listen
 Sarah,
 we
 feel


I
 think
 I
 can
 speak
 for
 everybody
 uh


here
 in
 the
 USA
 House
 that
 we're
 really


glad
 that
 you're
 so
 vigilant
 and
 dogged


in
 protecting
 the
 First
 Amendment.
 Give


it
 up
 for
 Sarah
 Rogers.
