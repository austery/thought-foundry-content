[Speaker 1]:  okay。
[Speaker 1]:  let's talk about the chenguang g chung versus wong g and defamation lawsuit。
[Speaker 1]:  he didn't just announce the lawsuit on twitter。
[Speaker 1]:  he also commissied a documentary to report the entire process。
[Speaker 1]:  this video has been retweeted by chenguu ang chhung on twitter，
[Speaker 1]:  so you can watch it if you're interested it basically documents the whole process，
[Speaker 1]:  explaining why he decided to sue wa NGE。
[Speaker 1]:  the origin of the lawsuit actually stems ps from a video wong g，
[Speaker 1]:  en made in august twenty twenty five。
[Speaker 1]:  the title was is chenguu ang chchung really blind。
[Speaker 1]:  it questioned whether he was faking，
[Speaker 1]:  his blindness，
[Speaker 1]:  claiming his eyesight was perfectly fine。
[Speaker 1]:  this video sparked widespread public debate。
[Speaker 1]:  but if you watch it，
[Speaker 1]:  you'll realize the core of the video wasn't actually about whether he was truly blind。
[Speaker 1]:  that was just a sensational title，
[Speaker 1]:  the entire content revolved around him and fuchi。
[Speaker 1]:  and there charitable foundation，
[Speaker 1]:  their fundraising efforts and the lack of transparency in their finances。
[Speaker 1]:  furthermore，
[Speaker 1]:  fuchi ones，
[Speaker 1]:  multiple properties and chenguang g chung himself also bought a large house supposedly paying for it in full。
[Speaker 1]:  this is what i saw on twitter。
[Speaker 1]:  i'm not sure if it's true，
[Speaker 1]:  but given chenguangangchung status and his experience coming to the US，
[Speaker 1]:  if you're relying on donations trying to use a charitable approach to fund your foundation，
[Speaker 1]:  because this foundation isn't just for you。
[Speaker 1]:  it's to help others in need，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  are you laandering the money into your own account through some channel？
[Speaker 1]:  this is actually the main point of contention。
[Speaker 1]:  it raises the question of whether the two individuals foundations finances are transparent，
[Speaker 1]:  and whether there are nonprofit organization is subject to proper oversight。
[Speaker 1]:  it also questions whether they considered these aspects during the online fundraising and operation of the foundation。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  chenguang n chchn g seized a certain tain imprecise statement。
[Speaker 1]:  wong genen made in the program that wong jian said he wasn't truly blind less than control one hundred greater than it's actually very easy to prove，
[Speaker 1]:  because the way ordinary people understand blindness and the medical definition of blindness are different。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  they are different chenguang GHUG。
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  you might find it strange that he wear sunglasses。
[Speaker 1]:  if he's blind，
[Speaker 1]:  how can he still post on twitter because there's also that photo of him driving a tesla。
[Speaker 1]:  this is actually the difference between the medical definition of blindness。
[Speaker 1]:  and our common understanding of it，
[Speaker 1]:  we understand blind people as someone who can't see anything at all like obing。
[Speaker 1]:  the blind musician who walks with a cane and can't see anything that kind of stereotypical image medically speaking。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  that's not actually the case。
[Speaker 1]:  low vision is essentially considered blindness。
[Speaker 1]:  you see，
[Speaker 1]:  he posted this message saying that on december twenty fourth，
[Speaker 2]:  the eve of christmas，
[Speaker 2]:  he filed a lawsuit for defamation against wo NG shl fy in the tokyo district court in japan。
[Speaker 2]:  wow，
[Speaker 2]:  and guang ang chung doesn't even celebrate christmas。
[Speaker 2]:  he goes to japan to sue w ong shelfi。
[Speaker 2]:  you're really going to sususomesomeone on chrimmas eve and in his lawsuit in japan，
[Speaker 2]:  he's demanding three hundred thirty million japanese yen in compensation。
[Speaker 2]: 哪个 do you know how much that is in US dollars divide by one hundred or one hundred fifty？
[Speaker 1]:  it's about two million US dollars。
[Speaker 1]:  wow，
[Speaker 1]:  two million US dollars。
[Speaker 1]:  this case has already been accepted by the court，
[Speaker 1]:  and the trial will begin on febary tenth tokyo time in courtroom，
[Speaker 1]:  six hundred twelve。
[Speaker 1]:  i don't know if it's open to the public，
[Speaker 1]:  but if it is，
[Speaker 1]:  then it should definitely be public。
[Speaker 1]:  i see some viewer saying they disagree with this statement。
[Speaker 1]:  so i need to explain changguong。
[Speaker 1]:  chchung is actually being a bit manipulative when he says he's blind。
[Speaker 1]:  he's taking advantage of the common societal perception of blinness。
[Speaker 1]:  that is that blind people can't see anything at all。
[Speaker 1]:  he's using this to his advantage，
[Speaker 1]:  then when it comes to suing ing wong gene，
[Speaker 1]:  he will，
[Speaker 1]:  again pick up the medical definition of blindness。
[Speaker 1]:  it seems changguong chchung is repeatedly switching between two definitions。
[Speaker 1]:  of course，
[Speaker 1]:  he's focusing on one g ans，
[Speaker 1]:  empresise statement and using it is a point to attack him and sue him。
[Speaker 1]:  everyone understands this v meaning behind。
[Speaker 1]:  it is quite clear，
[Speaker 1]:  because if you look at one genes videos，
[Speaker 1]:  most of the questioning is about the content of his foundation。
[Speaker 1]:  why didn't he refused？
[Speaker 1]:  wong genes claims about the foundation？
[Speaker 1]:  you're not fighting on that battlefield。
[Speaker 1]:  but instead，
[Speaker 1]:  you're trying to sneak ak attackhim，
[Speaker 1]:  you can see that his lawyer，
[Speaker 1]:  he must have consulted with a lawyer，
[Speaker 1]:  and the lawyer analyzed how to suw wong gene with a high chance of winning the point he found must have been determined after analysis by professionals concluding that suing wong gene on this point would likely lead to victory。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  this gives us outsiders a very bad impression，
[Speaker 1]:  because everyone knows what you meant when you said you were blind。
[Speaker 1]:  did you mean socially blind or medically blind？
[Speaker 1]:  don't you know what you're saying？
[Speaker 1]:  now you're using this to sue wa GG an repeatedly switching between two standards。
[Speaker 1]:  this gives a very bad impression。
[Speaker 1]:  so i think there's a good chance that something will happen on a legal level。
[Speaker 1]:  i think you will likely win because this point is using to attack wong。
[Speaker 1]:  genen was definitely carefully considered and analyzed by his lawyer before being chosen。
[Speaker 1]:  if you look at what he announced in the video，
[Speaker 1]:  including his documentary，
[Speaker 1]:  he explains it very clearly。
[Speaker 1]:  wong genans slandder and defamation against me saying，
[Speaker 1]:  i'm not a truly blind person has caused me great trouble。
[Speaker 1]:  every time i do a show or post something，
[Speaker 1]:  a lot of people say you're a fake blind person，
[Speaker 1]:  you're faking it or something like that。
[Speaker 1]:  this has caused me great physical and mental distress。
[Speaker 1]:  and it has also affected my financial situation。
[Speaker 1]:  people think i'm a pn z frauster。
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  no，
[Speaker 1]:  i'm not。
[Speaker 1]:  i'm pretending to be a blind person，
[Speaker 1]:  but i can actually see perfectly fine。
[Speaker 1]:  and then my foundation's donations might be affected。
[Speaker 1]:  so this，
[Speaker 1]:  if i were lawyer chenguu ang c hang，
[Speaker 1]:  i could even register some fake accounts to criticize him，
[Speaker 1]:  saying，
[Speaker 1]:  wong，
[Speaker 1]:  you're not a fake blind person，
[Speaker 1]:  are you？
[Speaker 1]:  and then orchestraate a whole self directed performance，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  so comma，
[Speaker 1]:  i think after careful analysis that he has a higher probability of winning，
[Speaker 1]:  the probability of him winning should be over sixty percent，
[Speaker 1]:  maybe even seventy percent。
[Speaker 1]:  because if you look at his strategy in the video，
[Speaker 1]:  he didn't get involved in any political stance debates，
[Speaker 1]:  but instead focused on factual misrepresentations。
[Speaker 1]:  this is actually the difference between the value of freedom of speech，
[Speaker 1]:  protection and verifiable factual statements。
[Speaker 1]:  you can say，
[Speaker 1]:  wong，
[Speaker 1]:  you said，
[Speaker 1]:  i'm not blind。
[Speaker 1]:  this is a factual error。
[Speaker 1]:  the trouble you cause me through this propaganda。
[Speaker 1]:  i'm going to sue you for it。
[Speaker 1]:  quote，
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  that's right。
[Speaker 1]:  so this is one probably finds this quite troubsome。
[Speaker 1]:  you'll definitely have to。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  there's a high probability that this will happen。
[Speaker 1]:  some viewers asked in the us is the freedom of speech more relaxed regarding public figures，
[Speaker 1]:  like you can insult the president and so on。
[Speaker 1]:  let me explain in the us for public fifires res。
[Speaker 1]:  you have to prove that they acwith with tutumalice。
[Speaker 1]:  but i doubt if japan has a similar clause，
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  in the US，
[Speaker 1]:  if i call president trumping monkey and president trump wants to sue me，
[Speaker 1]:  he has to prove that i had actual malstwds，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  how can you prove what i'm thinking in my head？
[Speaker 1]:  how can you prove that it's too difficult？
[Speaker 1]:  so if i insult a public figure，
[Speaker 1]:  if i insult the president，
[Speaker 1]:  i basically wonget into trouble，
[Speaker 1]:  but it's not necessarily the case in japan。
[Speaker 1]:  japan may not have this cloass。
[Speaker 1]:  so we should know that this involves the difference between value judgments and factual statements。
[Speaker 1]:  if we're talking about a certain whether someone is blind or not，
[Speaker 1]:  that can be verified medically in this respect，
[Speaker 1]:  i think that if walms on in this program，
[Speaker 1]:  if the plint of could present ent this as a very complechachain of evidence，
[Speaker 1]:  then if consisired an an jejetive statement of fact，
[Speaker 1]:  it's not protected by freedom of speech。
[Speaker 1]:  so there's indeed of point he can attack。
[Speaker 1]:  there's a point here if wm zon had said at the time that chenguang chchung wasn't blind in the social sense that would have been much better。
[Speaker 1]:  that's right in a program。
[Speaker 1]:  he also said that he consult a doctors，
[Speaker 1]:  and there there are no clical ical records of high fever，
[Speaker 1]:  damaging eyeght。
[Speaker 1]:  so you can say that wone juice program wasn't rigorous enough from the perspective of proving something false。
[Speaker 2]:  you're doing it wrong。
[Speaker 2]:  you can't prove it false this way。
[Speaker 2]:  you can't use this method to prove it false，
[Speaker 2]:  right？
[Speaker 2]:  even if you haven't heard of it yourself。
[Speaker 2]:  so doesn't mean it doesn't exist。
[Speaker 2]:  moreover，
[Speaker 2]:  the other party can easily disprove your claim if you could present some evident，
[Speaker 2]:  such as refuding medical facts，
[Speaker 2]:  proving that similar incidents did happen in shanddoong with a lot of authority，
[Speaker 2]:  tive medical literature and knowledge。
[Speaker 2]:  wouldn't your argument be untennble？
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  god，
[Speaker 1]:  so proving something false。
[Speaker 1]:  this way is not acceptable。
[Speaker 1]:  i think if he had said that he wasn't blind in the sociological sense that we understand that he could drive a car and do other things wouldn't have been enououright that would have achieved the same effect，
[Speaker 1]:  then walm zon use used reporore susui，
[Speaker 1]:  then one sube who made a hideo，
[Speaker 1]:  saying that chenguong chchunang likes photography，
[Speaker 1]:  then he question how a blind person could take pictures，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  this is actually a misconception，
[Speaker 1]:  because these technologies are now very mature。
[Speaker 1]:  you can use sound touch and other technological aids for photography。
[Speaker 1]:  i saw someone in the comments section saying that uh，
[Speaker 1]:  he himself is actually blind，
[Speaker 1]:  but he use an apple phone completely without any difficulty。
[Speaker 1]:  this shows that technology has mature to a point where you can interact with the internet very well，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  so the fact that he takes pictures doesn't prove that he's not blind。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  i'm going to post a picture here。
[Speaker 1]:  this is a tweet that chenguang ang chhgg posted。
[Speaker 1]:  i won't play the video here because it's very much NSFW not safe for work，
[Speaker 1]:  but you can see that when he posts these things on twitter，
[Speaker 1]:  he's a very extreme trump supporter。
[Speaker 1]:  if you followed his twitter，
[Speaker 1]:  you'll know that is very clear about this。
[Speaker 1]:  he's probably even more supportive of trump than elon musk。
[Speaker 1]:  he's so supportive of trump that it's a bit much。
[Speaker 1]:  so many people are puzzled。
[Speaker 1]:  aren't you blind？
[Speaker 1]:  how can you still post on twitter engaging in online arguments right question？
[Speaker 1]:  mark，
[Speaker 1]:  very aggressive online arguments。
[Speaker 1]:  what's going on？
[Speaker 1]:  close。
[Speaker 1]:  this is actually a point of doubt for many netizines。
[Speaker 1]:  the third point is this tesla picture。
[Speaker 1]:  this tesla picture is actually a mean here。
[Speaker 1]:  he says，
[Speaker 1]:  today。
[Speaker 1]:  i went a test drive a tesla electric car with a friend。
[Speaker 1]:  it felt great。
[Speaker 1]:  it can accelerate to one hundred，
[Speaker 1]:  twenty kilometers per hour in two seconds。
[Speaker 1]:  quote。
[Speaker 1]:  there's a picture of him sitting in the driver's seat。
[Speaker 1]:  some people will wonder you're blind，
[Speaker 1]:  can blind people even drive find this very difficfict t to understdone。
[Speaker 2]:  someone also said，
[Speaker 2]:  after i reposted this post，
[Speaker 2]:  don't you understand chinese？
[Speaker 2]:  he said he test sts drove a tesla，
[Speaker 2]:  but you don't know it。
[Speaker 2]:  quote cheng u。
[Speaker 2]:  ang gchung in another post stood in front of a tesla and said，
[Speaker 2]:  if you're buying a car buy a tesla，
[Speaker 2]:  i'm a very proud tesla owner and then showed off his tesla。
[Speaker 1]:  you can see that he actually bought one right okdud。
[Speaker 1]:  so he's saying that these AI identification technologies can help him engage in online arguments on twitter，
[Speaker 1]:  including that chenguang chchung，
[Speaker 1]:  even commented on the rampant yellow tweets sexually explicit content on twitter。
[Speaker 1]:  i didn't pay attention to that，
[Speaker 1]:  but you can see that professor changguangchung has a wide range of interests。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  wow，
[Speaker 0]: 我是我个，
[Speaker 0]: 这是这是是的，
[Speaker 0]: 这的这个。
[Speaker 1]:  and then there are other accusations like wong juws video wasn't just for entertainment，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  he edited out the clip of chengguang ang chung sniffing his nose and repeatedly played at the crucial part。
[Speaker 1]:  i heard it too，
[Speaker 1]:  and i thought it was quite funcey，
[Speaker 1]:  but it's really not very ethical by doing that。
[Speaker 1]:  aren't you just trying to humiliate him？
[Speaker 1]:  he only snifed once，
[Speaker 1]:  but made it seem like he was was ninifing every few seconds。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  this psive aggressive behavior from wong jew is particularly noticeable。
[Speaker 1]:  he has an uncontrollable urge to be sarcastic。
[Speaker 1]:  comppsive aggressive this one due is really something when it comes to creating drama explanation，
[Speaker 1]:  mark，
[Speaker 1]:  this kind of drama indeed his style。
[Speaker 1]:  then there's another tweet where chent one chg's original，
[Speaker 1]:  meaning should have been a casual laugh，
[Speaker 1]:  but one and translated it as a ude with civivious laugh in the program。
[Speaker 1]:  this might also be inaccurate。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  chenguu NCANG also frequently attacked harris using her private life。
[Speaker 1]:  if you search as twitter，
[Speaker 1]:  you'll see a lot of this，
[Speaker 1]:  actually neither side has much to say about this one and might not have quoted that tweet precisely。
[Speaker 1]:  but i think wes overall expression of chenguangchchg's meaning is accurate。
[Speaker 1]:  chenguang chchungg was indeed aggsively attacking harris on twitter，
[Speaker 1]:  saying that she had problems with her private life and various other things。
[Speaker 1]:  so this lawsuit is now very clear。
[Speaker 0]: 嗯，
[Speaker 1]:  on the one hand，
[Speaker 1]:  he's saying that he wants to protect his reputation，
[Speaker 1]:  and then he wants the author to pay the legal price，
[Speaker 1]:  prevents similar behavior from happening again，
[Speaker 1]:  and set a standard for the boundaries of freedom of speech and responsibility。
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  actually everyone knows why he's suing wong GM because in one g，
[Speaker 1]:  ms。
[Speaker 1]:  video，
[Speaker 1]:  he made it very clear that the point of contention is the problems with chenguang gchang's foundation。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  his source of income was cut off saying，
[Speaker 1]:  he's a blind man is just click way to attrtract viewers。
[Speaker 1]:  but if you watch that episode，
[Speaker 1]:  you know he was basically talking about why his foundation is in transparent and whether there are financial problems，
[Speaker 1]:  he didn't use these reasons to counter suu wan。
[Speaker 1]:  and i think he's calculated this very carefully。
[Speaker 1]:  on the one hand，
[Speaker 1]:  if you really sue the website from this perspective，
[Speaker 1]:  then the lawyers can conduct a discovery process，
[Speaker 1]:  a process of exploring evidence，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  the lawyers from both sides have to exchange evidence，
[Speaker 1]:  then cheng UAGCANG would have to hand over all the financial records of his foundation to wong genans lawyer。
[Speaker 2]:  he definitely can't bear that if there's something fishy，
[Speaker 2]:  wouldn't you be exposed，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  so that's why you can see that in vane's very long video program chen only seized on the point that he's not a real person to sue him。
[Speaker 1]:  there's a big reason for that。
[Speaker 1]:  he's quite cuning very cunning。
[Speaker 1]:  you can see that one had already posted something at the time。
[Speaker 1]:  he said that an hour afwane's program aired someone suggested that chent wongchung and his wife seow him japan，
[Speaker 1]:  the blblind chchwongg's lawyer quickly side and reposted it。
[Speaker 1]:  you can see that this jauan is very sarcastic。
[Speaker 1]:  he quickly side。
[Speaker 1]:  he。
[Speaker 1]:  he said that our program based on quickly available information and complies with media reporting principles for public foundations and public figures。
[Speaker 1]:  i'm not afraid of any lawsuits，
[Speaker 1]:  whether it's related to the marine industry or not，
[Speaker 1]:  i will take it seriously。
[Speaker 1]:  all lawsuits are the legal rights of the other party。
[Speaker 1]:  but i would like to remind you that the litigation costs for lawsuits concerning the use of public funds should not be born by the foundations。
[Speaker 1]:  donations。
[Speaker 1]:  quote，
[Speaker 1]:  oh，
[Speaker 1]:  dut，
[Speaker 1]:  yes。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  dut。
[Speaker 1]:  so now this situation，
[Speaker 1]:  the lawsuit has already begun。
[Speaker 1]:  i think one can do a lot of things at worst。
[Speaker 1]:  he can just bring the fight to the us，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  yeah，
[Speaker 2]:  suing changguang ang chung g in the us。
[Speaker 2]:  and you're trying to use this moitious lawsuit to infringe upon my freedom of speech rights。
[Speaker 2]:  you want to silence me，
[Speaker 2]:  right？
[Speaker 2]:  you want to stop independent media from questioning your fund。
[Speaker 2]:  are you using this despicable lawsuit to intimidate me？
[Speaker 2]:  isn't that your purpose？
[Speaker 2]:  well，
[Speaker 2]:  also you back，
[Speaker 2]:  i'll say viviolted the rules of freedom of speech。
[Speaker 0]: 嗯。
[Speaker 1]:  and let me tell you he could directly produce a program，
[Speaker 1]:  saying，
[Speaker 1]:  chan GANCHANG is your und being misused sed，
[Speaker 1]:  you mised appropriating the money money 'll set up an investigation team and higher professional american investigative journalists to investigate this quonow。
[Speaker 1]:  i see that。
[Speaker 1]:  so many people at the washington posts were fired。
[Speaker 1]:  weren't they？
[Speaker 1]:  they fired？
[Speaker 1]:  jeff ff zos well hire a few of them as contractors to work on this project to work on this case，
[Speaker 1]:  investigate chengguangchun's fun thoroughly。
[Speaker 1]:  what do you thinking withstand that？
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  many countermeasures he can take。
[Speaker 1]:  so i think chenguangchchg's actions are actually very foolish because he's not in writing this matter，
[Speaker 2]:  if he were to respond positively to the questions about his foundation，
[Speaker 2]:  saying，
[Speaker 2]:  regarding wong unge's accusations，
[Speaker 2]:  i will publicly disclose all the details of how every donation was used。
[Speaker 2]:  the information is all public，
[Speaker 2]:  there's no problem。
[Speaker 1]:  then one on ge's accusations would be disprove them。
[Speaker 1]:  and then on that basis，
[Speaker 1]:  i can say you said，
[Speaker 1]:  i caused you great trouble by helping someone。
[Speaker 2]:  then i think on the one hand，
[Speaker 2]:  you can stand on the moral high ground in public opinion。
[Speaker 2]:  on the other hand，
[Speaker 1]:  you'll fight this battle very well。
[Speaker 1]:  now he refuses to talk about the lawsuits against him or the issues related to these lawsuits。
[Speaker 1]:  he also refuses to disclose the messy accounts of this foundation，
[Speaker 1]:  but he goes to japan to zoowomzon first in the court of public opinion。
[Speaker 1]:  do you think chen is clearly doing this for revenge because someone question him？
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  this is quite devisive。
[Speaker 1]:  actually，
[Speaker 1]:  i watch that episode of the show where wong jew also mentioned it。
[Speaker 1]:  specifically，
[Speaker 1]:  he said that mister joe funzeo's foundation is quite legitimate with very clear accounts in everything。
[Speaker 1]:  so if anyone wants to donate because it donate to mister joe fzeos foundation，
[Speaker 1]:  because it was able to withstand one ze's foundation。
[Speaker 1]:  so it definitely has some credibility，
[Speaker 1]:  but i saw that joe funzos founpoted shandwangong post on twitter supporting shandguangong against wzong。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  he himself is relatively clean，
[Speaker 1]:  but he is definitely to satisfied with wongin because what kind of people does joe phone associate with，
[Speaker 1]:  you know that right，
[Speaker 1]:  of course，
[Speaker 1]:  his own integrity，
[Speaker 1]:  and which side he takes are much trouble。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  that's right。
[Speaker 1]:  so you see wm zon consir up so much trouble。
[Speaker 1]:  and i think chandguong g chung underestimated warong zon's power。
[Speaker 1]:  what did wangzong do back then？
[Speaker 1]:  iran to the united states to fang shimmman。
[Speaker 1]:  he not only that，
[Speaker 1]:  but he went through the entire legal process in the american judicial system。
[Speaker 1]:  he knows the system very well。
[Speaker 1]:  i predict i predict that one might police sh ununt，
[Speaker 2]:  like directly filing accountersuit in the united states against chingguang ang chung and even flying to the US to filmer documentary。
[Speaker 2]:  i think this could definitely lead to a direct confrontation。
[Speaker 2]:  actually，
[Speaker 2]:  if you organizes a class action lawsuit，
[Speaker 2]:  considering the numerous problems with your five zero，
[Speaker 2]:  one c，
[Speaker 2]:  three charities counts，
[Speaker 2]:  II wong，
[Speaker 1]:  you could make a show out of it and rarely a group of people in the united states to file a class action lawsuit that would be quite promising。
[Speaker 1]:  and one more thing i wanted to say is that chenwung chged demand for two million dollars and compensation is outrageous。
[Speaker 1]:  what reason you have to demand so much money？
[Speaker 1]:  i feel like the intention is more about creating a big news story rather than a serious demand for compensation。
[Speaker 1]:  and in japanese legal history，
[Speaker 1]:  there are no president supporting such a high amount。
[Speaker 1]:  it's impossible。
[Speaker 1]:  the probability of you getting such a large amount in compensation is almost zero。
[Speaker 1]:  well。
[Speaker 1]:  i think wong jian is very likely to lose the lawsuit regarding the blind people issue。
[Speaker 1]:  i think he might choose not to spend too much energy defending himself on this point。
[Speaker 1]:  he can just pay some money，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  chenguu ang GH ung might release some bizarre apology video or something，
[Speaker 1]:  and then pay one or two tens of thousands of dollars in compensation。
[Speaker 1]:  i think almost at most twenty thousand US dollars。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  there are precedents in japan，
[Speaker 1]:  where similar cases resulted in compensation of forty thousand US dollars。
[Speaker 1]:  he can do so many other things chenguguang gchung in this matter。
[Speaker 2]:  you might win the lawsuit，
[Speaker 2]:  but lose the public opinion。
[Speaker 2]:  i think this is highly likely to happen。
[Speaker 2]:  so let's wait and see。
[Speaker 1]:  i don't know if anyone has other opinions，
[Speaker 1]:  i think one gene is very likely to bring this battle to the united states。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  some viewers might have checked。
[Speaker 1]:  and they said that in japan，
[Speaker 1]:  while defamation convictions are strict，
[Speaker 1]:  there is an exception if the facts you spread in the public interest，
[Speaker 1]:  only for maintaining public welfare and proven to be true，
[Speaker 1]:  then it is not constitute defamation。
[Speaker 1]:  this seems to be a rather tricky。
[Speaker 1]:  legal point is indeed for the public interest，
[Speaker 1]:  but there is a slight mistake in distinguishing between blind people in a sociological sense，
[Speaker 1]:  and in a medical sense。
[Speaker 1]:  so we'll see the court rules。
[Speaker 1]:  but i also tend to think that the compensation won't be very high，
[Speaker 1]:  probably in the tens of thousands of US dollars range。
[Speaker 1]:  if you look at similar cases in japan，
[Speaker 1]:  the compensation amount for defamation generally ranges from one million to three million japanesian have most at most。
[Speaker 1]:  so i think this is the current situation。
[Speaker 1]:  those were interested can follow up and research further，
[Speaker 1]:  but this discussion about chen gua n chhg's battle with wong gene has just begun。
[Speaker 1]:  we will continue to follow up later。
[Speaker 1]:  okay。
[Speaker 1]:  so should we wrap up soon and move onto the next segment today？
[Speaker 1]:  seems a little，
[Speaker 1]:  let's try to control the time。
[Speaker 1]:  okay，
[Speaker 1]:  wait，
[Speaker 1]:  let me stop for a moment。
[Speaker 1]:  my screen is lagging。
[Speaker 1]:  laoue。
[Speaker 1]:  do you play video games？
[Speaker 1]:  oh，
[Speaker 1]:  dear，
[Speaker 1]:  it's been a while since i've played this。
[Speaker 1]:  but since the spring festival is coming up，
[Speaker 1]:  i should start composing again，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  yes。
[Speaker 1]:  so i was just discussing this with you because today zuro mention that something rather strange happen at his house。
[Speaker 1]:  i said，
[Speaker 1]:  okay，
[Speaker 1]:  then i'll fill in in for tetemporily。
[Speaker 1]:  but but if zuro can come next week，
[Speaker 1]:  i'll have to take some time off to finish this piece。
[Speaker 1]:  are you going to use AII for composing？
[Speaker 1]:  or how are you going to do it？
[Speaker 1]:  yes。
[Speaker 1]:  i'll definitely continue to create an AI team like last time and have the AI and the chorst sing h。
[Speaker 1]:  ah okay，
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  but the writing part will definitely have to be done by me writing each part individually。
[Speaker 1]:  currently。
[Speaker 1]:  AI is indeed quite far from the standard in the composition aspect，
[Speaker 1]:  but in terms of singing，
[Speaker 1]:  whether it's lead vocals or chorus，
[Speaker 1]:  i think the AI singers are already very good，
[Speaker 1]:  very，
[Speaker 1]:  very good，
[Speaker 1]:  very professional。
[Speaker 1]:  i watched one juice program，
[Speaker 1]:  and basically the ending also uses similar technology。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  duck and one jw has long been using AI to dub sheet jumping and various other things。
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  shelw wn g did a good job。
[Speaker 1]:  he can come back now，
[Speaker 1]:  he can come back now，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  the comrades from the united front work department are showing you their kind concern。
[Speaker 1]:  okay，
[Speaker 1]:  let's then control one one hundred of them。
