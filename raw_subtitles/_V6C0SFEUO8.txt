So what if your child had the heart,
the drive, the skill
for something they love,
but not the access?
What if a sport your child loved ...
denied her the ability to play
because of her gender?
Let's imagine your granddaughter,
your sister, your niece.
Let's imagine a world
where she had every opportunity
that exists for a young boy.
Where the playing field
wasn't just metaphorically level,
it was literally accessible to her.
Let's think about ...
A world where every locker room door
opened with the same ease for everyone.
That question
has stayed with me for years
and is really the reason
why I'm standing here today.
I played in the NFL for 15 years,
was an all-star,
and now serve as executive vice president
of football operations for the NFL.
I think about my journey
and this journey of sport and football.
I was raised by a strong woman,
Alma Vincent,
this quiet determination
and women surrounded my life
throughout my childhood.
That brings me back to a young girl
in the city of Trenton, New Jersey,
named Tracy Williams.
Now, Tracy not only played every sport,
Tracy competed,
Tracy was smart, Tracy was fast.
Tracy not only competed,
Tracy used to whoop our tails.
(Laughter)
But as time went on,
there was no coach or recruiter
in the neighborhood recruiting Tracy.
There was no place for girls,
as what we would call,
on the football playing field.
So as time went on, she dreamed,
but her access quickly vanished.
Today, a father of five,
not so young kids anymore.
Five different dreams,
five different personalities.
Five different aspirations
and five levels of complete drama.
(Laughter)
I have had my fair share
of carpools and sport practices.
Our oldest child, Desiré,
our oldest daughter,
our beautiful daughter, Desiré,
has always had this hunger
and this competitiveness about her,
could throw a pretty good spiral
by the time Des was seven.
Des was smart, Desiré was agile.
Many would consider her slightly tough.
Desiré played a ton
of football in the backyards
with her brother and friends.
By the time Desiré turned ten,
the opportunity to keep playing
quickly vanished.
It wasn’t because Desiré lost interest.
Desiré lost access.
Meanwhile,
her brothers, our sons,
they had the opportunity
to continue to play,
at both the high school level
and the collegiate level.
I realized that I was giving my sons
or teaching my sons,
life lessons of toughness, building grit,
telling them not to cry.
And quickly,
I realized that I was just reinforcing
this thing called the man box,
where I was teaching my sons one thing,
but then, yet reinforcing
that boys get to compete
and girls get to cheer.
It was at that time I realized
that the system was broken.
Fast forward 30 years,
flag football has truly emerged
as this dynamic, all-inclusive sport.
Today ...
It is not only creating options
for young women,
it is being played by 20 million people
across 100 different countries.
This flag movement is real.
It is creating options for young women
that never existed before.
Flag football teachers,
as we would consider, these life skills
that football has always taught.
They just haven't been shared
with young girls.
Of leadership, resiliency, toughness.
It develops grit.
Now young women, young girls
have an opportunity to compete.
Now you may be asking yourself,
why this movement?
Why all of a sudden this explosion?
It's affordable,
it's accessible.
It's all-inclusive.
And I'll add one more point there.
It's social-media friendly.
Seventeen states
have sanctioned girls’ varsity flag
as a true varsity sport in high school.
Nineteen additional states
have pilot programs.
One hundred-plus colleges now offer
flag with scholarships.
Let's take
Ki'Lolo Westerlund.
I love this, I just I love this image.
Why?
She's the first female
to earn a Division-one
full scholarship for flag football.
(Applause)
She's the first of many.
That's just the beginning.
And this is what excites me.
In 2028,
flag football will debut
in the Los Angeles Olympic Games.
OK, there's been 100 years --
(Applause)
But let's think about this.
A hundred-plus years of football
and our young ladies
will be able to represent,
will take the field in a sport
that once had no place for them.
We're not in the Olympic Games
if not for the participation
and the skill level of young
women across the globe.
NFL flag, we're now
in six different continents.
Flag is truly becoming a global language.
It is truly taking the world by storm.
And it's taking the world by storm
because of the participation of women.
Women are driving this movement.
I won't allow anyone to say,
well, it's because of marketing.
No it's not. It's simple.
We opened the door for her
and we gave her
an opportunity to participate,
and she's taken our sport
to another level.
It is so important that this movement,
that we nurture it
in this time and this space.
We must nurture this movement.
What do I mean by nurturing the movement?
Let's take advantage of this momentum.
The one thing that we
have to be careful of,
and this is why I'll challenge
the group here.
It is so important that we don't
commercialize it for men or boys,
because there's a tendency to do that,
to commercialize the sport
and create a commercial model for boys.
And then yet we get satisfied
with just access for women.
No.
We must create a equal playing field
as we develop this great sport.
It is so important that we nurture it.
So you may be asking, well, what can I do?
Ask the question at your schools.
Start small.
Reach out to your local parks and rec.
Are you offering,
do young women have the ability
to play flag football
at your school,
at your local parks and rec?
What this does for young ladies,
I think about, we talk about life skills.
Life skills and football
are so transferable.
We need to remind,
just like we remind our young boys,
these transferable skills
that I live by every single day.
Leadership, toughness,
communication skills,
these are all transferable life skills.
Read the defense, read a room.
Call an audible, solve a problem.
Lead a drive, lead in life.
These are things that we've
been telling our young boys
and what the game provides us
as a transferable life skill
for over 100 years.
They're now on the table
as an option for young ladies.
If we can, can we just run the video?
(Video)
Person 1: I feel that right now
we are living an amazing moment in time
for women in sports.
Person 2: Flag football makes you
feel powerful and strong and fearless.
Person 3: To see what women can do
in this sport is pretty amazing.
Person 4: Bring your teammates
back up with you, let's go.
Person 5: I see her dedication
and her love for the game.
Person 6: The self-confidence
this sport gave them is immeasurable.
Person 7: It's made her
such a strong person.
Person 8: For many years,
we've heard so many no's.
No, you can't play.
No, you're just a woman.
No, you're never going
to be as fast as man.
We belong on the football field now.
It's an Olympic sport.
We're going there.
It's our sport.
It's our time.
We're going to the Olympics.
[Our sport]
[Our time]
[To make history]
(Applause)
So in closing,
my challenge to the audience,
to the group, to the world.
Let's just imagine a world where
Tracy from my old neighborhood,
my granddaughters Laila, Rosie,
Nadia, Giani,
imagine a world
where they can take the field.
Imagine a world where your niece,
your sister, your daughter
is representing our country.
Imagine a world where
your niece, your daughter,
your granddaughter ...
Is walking out in the opening ceremony.
Here's my challenge
and here's what I would leave.
Let her lead.
Let her dream.
Just let her take the field.
Why?
Because the future of football and sports
it is through women.
And it's now.
Thank you.
(Applause)
