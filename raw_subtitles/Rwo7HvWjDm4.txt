Welcome
 to
 the
 final
 episode
 of
 2025.


[music]
 I
 pulled
 together
 some
 of
 my


favorite
 moments
 from
 the
 year.
 These


conversations
 help
 me
 think
 better,
 work


smarter,
 and
 live
 with
 more
 intention.


[music]
 It's
 time
 to
 listen
 and
 learn.


>> Toughness,
 kindness,
 and
 clarity.
 All


three.
 But
 don't
 forget
 the
 toughness.


Cuz
 you
 don't
 want
 yes
 people
 around


you.
 You
 want
 people
 who
 say,
 "Why
 don't


we
 push
 the
 boundaries
 of
 our
 thinking?"


AI
 makes
 me
 get
 to
 the
 answer
 perhaps


[music]
 more
 quickly,
 but
 you
 need


someone
 with
 experience
 to
 know
 which
 of


those
 references
 matter
 to
 the
 business.


>> I
 am
 genuinely
 concerned
 that
 because


[music]
 of
 different
 societal
 factors,


because
 of
 people
 who
 maybe
 lost
 out


[music]
 on
 some
 social
 skills
 during
 the


pandemic,
 there
 is
 not
 that
 rejection


resilience
 that
 [music]
 many
 of
 us
 need


in
 life.


>> You
 mentioned
 that
 we
 can
 engineer


trust.
 How
 do
 we
 do
 that?


>> One
 is
 repeated
 exposure.
 Second
 is


establish
 [music]


a
 set
 of
 shared
 values.


>> Everything
 is
 here
 to
 teach
 me
 and
 help


me.
 It's
 all
 working
 for
 my
 good.
 So,


we're
 going
 to
 [music]
 go
 look
 for
 those


moments
 when
 you're
 most
 uncomfortable.


And
 remind
 yourself,
 this
 is
 my
 teacher.


>> From
 when
 a
 customer
 orders
 something,


[music]
 when
 it
 gets
 through
 the


distribution
 center,
 how
 it's
 going
 to


be
 p
 pack,
 packaged,
 and
 shipped.
 And


when
 you
 look
 at
 that
 from
 a
 flow


[music]
 perspective,
 you
 start
 thinking


about
 new
 solutions.


>> Getting
 really,
 really
 comfortable
 with


being
 uncomfortable
 is
 magic.
 [music]


And
 I
 wasn't
 always
 good
 at
 that.
 The


right
 entrepreneurs,
 the
 best


entrepreneurs,
 they
 just
 simply
 outcare


other
 people.


When
 you
 talk
 about
 inputs
 versus


outputs,
 what
 inputs
 do
 you
 think
 about


in
 life?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 it
 the
 inputs
 I
 think


about
 are
 um
 you
 know
 that
 it
 depends
 on


what
 I'm
 trying
 to
 get
 accomplished.
 But


if
 the
 inputs
 are
 just
 thinking
 about


hard
 work,
 how
 do
 I
 get
 up
 every
 day?
 If


I
 want
 to
 stay
 healthy,
 do
 I
 get
 up


every
 single
 day
 and
 work
 out?
 I
 I
 hear


that
 you
 work
 out
 every
 single
 day


because
 instead
 of
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


which
 days
 you're
 going
 to
 work
 out,


it's
 always
 a
 negotiation
 with
 which


days
 and
 some
 days
 you
 don't
 feel
 like


um
 exercising.
 You
 just
 work
 out
 every


day.
 I
 have
 the
 same
 philosophy.
 You


just
 get
 up
 every
 single
 day
 and
 do
 the


things
 that
 are
 important.
 Um,
 so
 the


inputs
 I
 have
 is
 I
 get
 up
 every
 morning,


I
 work
 out,
 I
 look
 through,
 I
 read


through
 my
 email
 and
 I
 try
 to
 think


about
 what's
 the
 most
 important
 thing


that
 I
 have
 to
 get
 right
 today.
 What's


the
 mo
 and
 um
 and
 think
 about
 first


order
 issues?
 What
 is
 the
 first
 order


issue
 that
 I
 have
 to
 solve?
 What
 is
 the


first
 order
 issue
 of
 a
 company
 that


needs
 to
 get
 fixed?
 um
 what
 is
 the
 first


what
 is
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 need
 to
 do
 to


influence
 an
 outcome
 for
 um
 for
 a


founder


and
 you
 know
 that's
 very
 very
 clarifying


often
 we
 can
 create
 a
 very
 very
 long


to-do
 list
 and
 then
 you
 got
 to
 pop
 up
 a


level
 and
 just
 look
 at
 the
 to-do
 list


what's
 the
 most
 important
 things
 I
 have


to
 get
 accomplished
 because
 if
 you
 just


list
 all
 the
 to-dos
 you
 probably
 will


not
 be
 able
 to
 get
 to
 all
 of
 them
 and


the
 most
 important
 thing
 might
 be
 the


last
 one
 you
 list
 and
 so
 you
 can't
 just


go
 down
 that
 list
 and
 do
 them
 one
 by


one.
 Often
 it's
 by
 popping
 up
 a
 level


where
 you
 sort
 of
 look
 at
 the
 whole
 list


and
 it's
 like
 okay
 well
 most
 of
 this
 is


not
 important.


>> Is
 that
 what
 you
 mean
 by
 first
 order


issue?
 I
 think
 you
 mean
 something
 a


little
 more
 nuanced.


>> Some
 people
 talk
 about
 the
 most


important
 thing.
 Um
 and
 I
 think
 I
 think


about


first
 order
 if
 I
 get
 this
 problem
 it
 I


have
 a
 problem
 on
 my
 hands.
 If
 I
 get
 to


the
 first
 order
 issue
 and
 get
 to
 the


root
 cause
 of
 that,
 usually
 that
 helps


solve
 that
 problem.
 And
 there
 are
 other


issues
 that
 are
 not
 first
 order.
 Um,
 and


that
 concept
 is
 quite
 important.
 We
 also


sort
 of
 navigate
 that
 into
 other
 uh


situations
 where
 um


where
 they
 are
 crucible
 bond.
 So,
 as
 an


example,
 like
 you
 you
 have


you
 have
 situations
 where


the
 website's
 not
 working
 fast
 enough.


At
 Zapos,
 we
 had
 a
 situation
 where
 the


website's
 not
 fast
 enough.
 Is
 the
 first


order
 issue
 that's
 we
 have
 too
 many


pictures?
 Well,
 we
 want
 the
 pictures.
 We


have
 lots
 of
 photos.
 We
 want
 to
 show


those
 photos.
 Is
 the
 first
 order
 issue


that
 we
 need
 to
 um
 trim
 the
 number
 of


search
 results?
 Well,
 customers
 want


longer
 search
 results.
 It's
 like,
 no,


it's
 none
 of
 that.
 we
 need
 to
 figure
 out


how
 to
 make
 the
 website
 go
 faster.
 And


so
 we
 start
 caching
 the
 the
 search


results.
 We
 start
 caching
 things.
 And
 so


you
 start
 developing
 the
 technologies


that
 solve
 the
 speed
 issue.
 But
 the


first
 sort
 of
 issue
 is
 that
 we
 need
 to


solve
 this
 with
 technology,
 not
 with
 a


bunch
 of
 either
 or
 solutions.
 Um
 that's


an
 example
 that
 I
 learned
 a
 long
 time


ago.
 Another
 situation
 is
 the


distribution
 at
 was
 not
 flowing
 well.


Um,
 and
 we
 couldn't
 figure
 out
 which


process
 was
 broken.
 Was
 it
 the
 picking


process?
 Was
 the
 was
 the
 ordering


process
 broken?
 What
 was
 broken
 about


it?
 And
 we
 went
 and
 just
 look
 through


the
 flow
 and
 the
 flow
 was
 broken.


And
 so,
 uh,
 there
 was
 too
 many
 handoffs,


uh,
 across
 all
 of
 these
 different


discrete
 processes.
 And
 so
 we
 have
 to


sort
 of
 pop
 up
 a
 level
 and
 figure
 out


what
 the
 flow
 of
 from
 when
 a
 customer


orders
 something
 when
 it
 gets
 through


the
 distribution
 center.
 How
 was
 going


to
 be
 p
 packed
 and
 uh
 packaged
 and


shipped.
 And
 when
 you
 look
 at
 that
 from


a
 flow
 perspective,
 you
 start
 thinking


about
 new
 solutions
 that
 allow
 there
 to


be
 much
 better
 flow
 throughout
 the


distribution
 center
 than
 been
 than
 to


batch
 things
 for
 picking,
 batch
 things


for
 um
 packing,
 batch
 batch
 things
 for


uh
 for
 shipping.
 So
 that's
 what
 you
 mean


by
 first
 order.
 Uh
 I
 want
 to
 get
 into


more
 of
 your
 experience
 not
 only
 at


Zapos
 but
 u
 being
 on
 the
 board
 of
 some


of
 the
 companies
 that
 everybody
 has


heard
 of
 um
 today
 or
 being
 involved
 but


before
 we
 get
 there
 I
 want
 to
 come
 back


to
 the
 school
 for
 a
 second.
 Are
 there


any
 other
 experiences
 that
 you
 had


during
 school
 with
 teachers
 that
 might


have
 impacted
 you?


>> You
 know
 earlier
 on
 in
 junior
 high


school
 I
 was
 um
 I
 was
 suspended
 from
 the


computer
 lab
 because
 I
 built
 so
 this
 was


very
 old.
 So
 there
 are
 radio
 shack


TRS80s.
 So
 we
 call
 them
 trash8s
 today.


Um
 and
 there
 was
 computer
 lab,
 you
 know,


you
 had
 to
 rent
 time
 in
 our
 computer
 lab


to
 to
 use
 the
 computer.
 And
 I
 built
 this


game
 and
 the
 central
 server
 at
 the
 time


was
 literally
 a
 floppy
 drive
 where
 all


of
 us
 saved
 our
 programs
 there.
 And
 one


day
 uh
 a
 bunch
 of
 the
 students
 uh
 in
 the


computer
 lab
 all
 found
 the
 game
 that
 I


programmed
 and
 then
 started
 playing
 with


it.
 The
 teacher
 and
 the
 principal
 just


happened
 to
 walk
 in
 and
 saw
 that
 we're


all
 playing
 this
 game.
 And
 um
 I
 was
 told


that
 computer
 lab
 is
 valuable
 time
 and


you
 should
 be
 doing
 something
 much
 more


productive
 than
 than
 producing
 a
 game.


So
 I
 I
 was
 no
 longer
 allowed
 to
 work
 in


the
 computer
 lab
 and
 the
 computer
 lab


teacher
 was
 Mrs.
 Possa
 and
 she
 she
 also


ran
 the
 math
 team
 and
 she
 said
 well
 you


I'm
 sorry
 the
 principal
 wants
 you
 out
 of


the
 computer
 lab
 but
 you
 should
 join
 the


math
 team
 and
 I
 joined
 the
 math
 team


there
 and
 um
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 was


really
 good
 at
 was
 math
 and
 she
 told
 me


that
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 a
 leader
 and
 you


want
 the
 team
 to
 win
 it's
 not
 good


enough
 for
 me
 to
 just
 solve
 the
 problems


figure
 out
 how
 to
 get
 the
 rest
 of
 the


team
 to
 perform.
 And
 so
 I
 started


teaching
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 math
 team
 some


of
 the
 reasons
 why
 I
 was
 able
 to
 solve


some
 of
 these
 problems
 more
 quickly
 than


there
 were.
 They
 were
 very
 talented,
 but


I
 had
 figured
 out
 tricks
 that
 they
 had


not
 figured
 out.
 And
 they
 had
 taught
 me


tricks
 that
 I
 had
 not
 figured
 out.
 So
 we


got
 better
 and
 better
 by
 riffing
 each


off
 each
 other.
 And
 so
 I
 learned
 the


value
 of
 teamwork
 by
 just
 being
 thrown


into
 a
 situation
 like
 that.


>> Such
 an
 interesting
 front
 row
 seat
 into


what's
 happening.
 Do
 you
 think
 founders


go
 astray
 when
 they
 start
 listening
 to


too
 many
 outside
 voices
 and
 this
 goes


back
 to
 the
 I'm
 sure
 you're
 aware
 the


Brian
 Chesy
 you
 know
 he
 the
 founder
 mode


like
 do
 you
 think
 talk
 to
 me
 about
 that


>> I
 have
 such
 a
 nuance
 point
 of
 view
 on


this
 because
 it
 is


>> decidedly
 not
 simple
 uh
 so
 broadly


speaking
 I
 really
 like
 the
 spirit
 of


founder
 mode
 which
 is
 just
 having


deep
 founder
 accountability
 for
 every


decision
 at
 your
 company.
 Um,
 I
 think


that
 that's
 how
 great
 companies
 operate.


Uh,
 and
 when
 you,
 you
 know,
 proverbally


make
 decisions
 by
 committee
 or
 you're


more
 focused
 on
 process
 than
 outcomes.


Um,
 that
 produces
 all
 the
 experiences
 we


hate
 as
 employees,
 as
 customers.
 You


know,
 that's
 the
 proverbial
 DMV,
 right?


You
 know,
 it's
 like
 process
 over


outcomes.
 Um
 and
 then
 similarly


uh
 you
 look
 at
 the
 disruption
 in
 all


industries
 right
 now
 because
 of
 AI
 you


know
 the
 companies
 that
 will
 recognize


where
 things
 are
 clearly
 going
 to
 change


like
 everyone
 can
 see
 it
 it's
 like
 a
 you


know
 slow
 motion
 car
 wreck
 everyone


knows
 how
 it
 ends
 you
 need
 that
 kind
 of


decisive
 breakthrough
 boundaries
 layers


of
 management
 um
 to
 actually
 make
 change


as
 fast
 as
 required
 in
 business
 right


now
 the
 issue
 I
 have
 not
 with
 Brian


statement
 Brian's
 amazing.
 Um
 is
 how


people
 can
 sort
 of
 interpret
 that
 and


sort
 of
 execute
 it
 as
 a
 caricature
 of


what
 I
 think
 it
 means.
 Uh
 you
 know
 there


was
 a
 I
 remember
 after
 Steve
 Jobs
 passed


away
 and
 you
 know
 um
 I
 don't
 know
 Steve


I've
 met
 Steve
 a
 couple
 times.
 I
 haven't


never
 worked
 with
 him
 in
 any
 meaningful


way,
 you
 know,
 but
 he
 was
 sort
 of
 uh
 if


you
 believe
 the
 stories
 like
 kind
 of


pretty
 hard
 on
 his
 employees
 and
 and


very
 exacting
 and
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


founders
 were
 like
 mimicking
 that,
 you


know,
 down
 to
 wearing
 a
 black
 turtleneck


and
 yelling
 at
 you
 their
 employees.
 I'm


like
 not
 sure
 that
 was
 the
 cause
 you


know
 I
 think
 Steve
 Jobs
 taste
 and


judgment
 through
 you
 know
 executed


through
 that
 you
 know
 packaging
 was
 the


cause
 of
 their
 success
 and
 somehow
 and


then
 similarly
 I
 think
 founder
 mode
 can


be
 weaponized
 as
 an
 excuse
 for
 just
 like


overt
 micromanagement


and
 that
 probably
 won't
 lead
 to
 great


outcomes
 either
 and
 most
 great
 companies


are
 filled
 with
 extremely
 great


individual
 contributors
 who
 make
 good


decisions
 and
 work
 really
 hard
 and
 uh


companies
 that
 are
 like
 solely
 executing


through
 the
 judgment
 of
 individual


probably
 aren't
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


scale
 to
 be
 truly
 great
 companies.
 So
 I


have a
 very
 nuanced
 point
 because
 I


actually
 believe
 in
 founders.
 I
 believe


in
 actually
 that
 accountability
 that


comes
 from
 the
 top.
 I
 believe
 in


cultures
 where
 you
 know
 founders
 have


license
 to
 go
 in
 and
 all
 the
 way
 to
 a


small
 decision
 and
 fix
 it.
 The
 infamous


question
 mark
 emails
 from
 Jeff
 Bezos,


you
 know
 that
 type
 of
 thing.
 That's


that's
 the
 right
 way
 to
 run
 a
 company.


But
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 you
 don't


have
 a
 culture
 where
 individuals
 are


accountable
 and
 empowered
 and
 uh
 you


don't
 want
 uh
 you
 know
 people
 trying
 to


decide
 make
 business
 decisions
 because


of
 what
 will
 please
 argue
 a
 leader
 you


know
 which
 is
 like
 the
 caricature
 of


this
 and
 so
 you
 know
 after
 that
 came
 out


I
 could
 sort
 of
 see
 it
 all
 happening


which
 is
 like
 some
 people
 will
 take
 that


be
 like
 you
 know what
 you're
 right
 I


need
 to
 go
 down
 and
 be
 in
 the
 details


and
 some
 people
 will
 do
 it
 and
 probably


make
 everyone
 who
 works
 for
 them


miserable
 and
 probably
 both
 will
 happen


as
 a
 consequence.


Totally.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 detail
 and


nuance
 there.
 I
 love
 that
 too.
 Do
 you


think
 engineers
 make
 good
 leaders?


>> I
 do
 think
 engineers
 make
 good
 leaders,


but
 one
 thing
 I've
 seen
 is
 that


I
 think
 that
 I
 really
 believe
 that
 great


CEOs
 and
 great
 founders
 um
 start
 usually


with
 one
 specialty
 but
 become


uh
 more
 broadly


specialists
 in
 all
 parts
 of
 their


business.
 Um
 you
 know
 I
 think
 the
 uh


businesses
 are
 multifaceted
 and
 rarely


is
 a
 business's
 success
 due
 to
 one
 thing


uh
 like
 engineering
 or
 product
 which
 is


where
 a
 lot
 of
 founders
 come
 from
 often


your
 go
 to
 market
 model
 is
 important
 uh


for
 consumer
 companies
 how
 you
 engage


with
 the
 world
 and
 public
 policy
 becomes


extremely
 important
 and
 I
 think
 as
 you


see
 um
 uh
 founders
 you
 know
 grow
 from


doing
 one
 thing
 to
 growing
 to
 being
 a


real
 meaningful
 company
 like
 Airbnb
 B
 or


meta
 or
 something
 you
 can
 see
 those


founders
 really
 transform
 from
 being
 one


thing
 to
 to
 many
 things.
 Um
 so
 I
 do


think
 engineers
 make
 great
 leaders.
 I


think
 the
 first
 principles
 thinking,
 the


system
 design
 thinking
 um
 really


benefits
 things
 like
 organization


design,
 strategy
 um
 and
 but
 I
 also
 think


that
 you
 know
 uh
 when
 we
 were
 speaking


earlier
 about
 identity,
 I
 think
 one
 of


the
 main
 transitions
 founders
 need
 to


make
 especially
 engineers
 uh
 is
 you're


not
 like
 the
 product
 manager
 for
 the


company,
 you're
 the
 CEO
 and
 on
 any
 given


day
 do
 you
 spend
 time
 recruiting
 an


executive
 because
 you
 have
 a
 need.
 Do


you
 spend
 time
 uh
 on
 sales
 because
 that


will
 have
 the
 biggest
 impact.
 Um
 do
 you


spend
 time
 on
 public
 policy
 or


regulation
 because
 if
 you
 don't
 uh
 it


will
 happen
 to
 you
 and
 and
 could
 really


impact
 your
 business
 in
 a
 negative
 way.


And
 I
 think
 engineers
 who
 are
 unwilling


to
 elevate
 their
 identity
 from
 what
 they


were
 to
 what
 it
 needs
 to
 be
 in
 the


moment
 often
 leads
 to
 sort
 of
 plateaus


uh
 in
 company's
 growth.
 So
 100%
 I
 think


engineers
 make
 great
 um
 leaders
 and
 it


it's
 not
 a
 coincidence.
 I
 think
 that


most
 of
 the
 Silicon
 Valley
 great
 Silicon


Valley
 CEOs
 came
 from
 engineering


backgrounds.
 Um
 but
 I
 also
 don't
 think


that's
 sufficient
 either
 as
 your
 company


scales
 and
 I
 think
 that
 making
 that


transition
 as
 all
 the
 great
 ones
 have
 is


incredibly
 important.


>> To
 what
 extent
 are
 all
 business
 problems


engineering
 problems?


>> That's
 a
 deeper
 philosophical
 question


than
 I
 think
 I
 have
 the
 capacity
 to


answer.
 Um
 what
 is
 engineering?
 What
 I


like
 about
 approaching
 problems


uh
 as
 an
 engineer
 is
 uh
 first
 principles


thinking
 and
 understanding


uh
 the
 root
 causes
 of
 issues
 rather
 than


simply
 addressing
 the
 symptoms
 of
 the


problem.
 And
 I
 do
 think
 that
 coming
 from


a
 background
 in
 engineering
 that
 is


everything
 from
 process
 like
 how


engineers
 do
 a
 root
 cause
 analysis
 of
 a


outage
 on
 a
 server
 is
 a
 really
 great
 way


to
 analyze
 why
 you
 lost
 a
 sales
 deal.


you
 know,
 like
 I
 love
 the
 systematic


approach
 of
 engineering.


One
 thing
 that
 I
 think
 going
 back
 to


good
 ideas
 that
 can
 become
 caricatures


of
 themselves
 like
 one
 thing
 I've
 seen


though
 with
 engineers
 who
 go
 into
 other


disciplines
 is
 um
 sometimes
 you
 can


overanalyze
 decisions
 in
 some
 domains.


Let's
 just
 take
 modern
 communications


which
 is
 driven
 in
 social
 media
 and
 and


very
 fast-paced.


um
 having
 a
 systematic
 first
 principles


discussion
 about
 every
 you
 know
 tweet


you
 do
 is
 probably
 not
 a
 great
 comm


strategy.
 Um
 and
 so
 uh
 and
 then


similarly
 um
 you
 know
 there
 are
 some


aspects
 of
 say
 enterprise
 software
 sales


that
 you
 know
 aren't
 rational
 but


they're
 human
 you
 know
 like
 forming


personal
 relationships
 you
 know
 and
 and


the
 the
 importance
 of
 those
 to
 building


trust
 with
 a
 a
 partner.
 it's
 not
 all


just
 you
 know
 product
 and
 technology
 and


so
 I
 would
 say
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 things


uh
 coming
 with
 an
 engineer
 mindset
 can


really
 benefit
 but
 I
 do
 think
 that
 uh


taking
 that
 to
 its
 like
 logical
 extreme


can
 lead
 to
 analysis
 paralysis
 can
 lead


to
 uh
 overintellectualizing
 some
 things


that
 are
 fundamentally
 human
 problems


and
 so
 yeah
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 can
 benefit


from
 engineering
 but
 I
 wouldn't
 say


everything's
 an
 engineering
 problem
 in


my
 experience


>> you've
 brought
 up
 first
 principles
 a


couple
 times
 You're
 running
 your
 third


startup
 now,
 Sierra.
 It's
 going
 really


well.
 How
 do
 you
 use
 first
 principles
 in


terms
 of
 how
 do
 you
 use
 that
 at
 work?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 it's
 particularly
 important


right
 now
 because
 the
 market
 of
 AI
 is


changing
 so
 rapidly.
 So,
 if
 you
 rewind
 2


years,
 you
 know,
 most
 people
 hadn't
 used


chat
 GPT
 yet.
 uh
 most
 companies
 hadn't


heard
 the
 phrase
 large
 language
 models


or
 generative
 AI
 yet
 and
 in
 two
 years


you
 have
 chat
 GBT
 becoming
 one
 of
 the


most
 popular
 consumer
 services
 in


history
 faster
 than
 his
 than
 any
 service


in
 history
 and
 you
 have
 across
 so
 many


domains
 in
 the
 enterprise
 uh
 really


rapid
 transformation.
 The
 law
 is
 being


transfer
 transformed.
 Marketing
 is
 being


transformed.
 Customer
 service
 which
 is


where
 my
 company
 Sierra
 works
 is
 being


transformed.
 Software
 engineering
 is


being
 transformed.
 And
 the
 amount
 of


change
 in
 such
 a
 short
 period
 of
 time
 is


uh
 I
 think
 unprecedented
 uh
 and
 uh


perhaps
 I
 lack
 the
 historical
 context


but
 it
 feels
 faster
 than
 anything
 I've


experienced
 in
 my
 career.
 And
 so
 as
 a


consequence,
 I
 think
 uh
 if
 you're


responding
 to
 the
 facts
 in
 front
 of
 you


and
 not
 thinking
 from
 first
 principles


about
 why
 we're
 at
 this
 point
 and
 where


it
 will
 probably
 be
 12
 months
 from
 now,


the
 likelihood
 that
 you
 will
 make
 the


right
 strategic
 decision
 is
 almost
 zero.


So
 uh
 as
 an
 example,


uh
 it's
 really
 interesting
 to
 me
 that


with
 modern
 large
 language
 models,
 one


of
 the
 careers
 that
 is
 being
 most


transformed
 is
 software
 engineering.
 uh


and
 you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 think
 a


lot
 about
 is
 how
 many
 software
 engineers


will
 we
 have
 at
 our
 company
 3
 years
 from


now
 what
 will
 the
 role
 of
 a
 software


engineer
 be
 as
 we
 go
 from
 being
 authors


of
 code
 to
 operators
 of
 code
 generating


machines
 um
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 for
 the


type
 of
 people
 we
 should
 recruit
 and
 if


I
 look
 at
 the
 actual
 craft
 of
 software


engineering
 that
 we're
 doing
 right
 now


um
 I
 think
 it's
 literally
 a
 act
 that


it'll
 be
 completely
 different
 2
 years


from
 now.
 Yet,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people


building
 companies
 hire
 for
 the
 problem


in
 front
 of
 them
 rather
 than
 doing
 that.


But
 two
 years
 is
 not
 that
 long.
 Those


people
 that
 you
 hire
 now
 will
 just
 be


getting
 really
 productive
 a
 couple
 years


from
 now.
 So,
 we
 try
 to
 think
 about
 most


of
 our
 long-term
 business
 from
 first


principles.
 Everything
 from
 I'll
 say
 a


couple
 examples
 in
 our
 business.
 Our


pricing
 model
 is
 really
 unique
 and
 comes


from
 first
 principles
 thinking
 rather


than
 having
 our
 customers
 pay
 a
 license


for
 the
 privilege
 of
 using
 our
 platform.


We
 only
 charge
 our
 customers
 for
 the


outcomes.
 Uh
 meaning
 if
 the
 AI
 agent


they've
 built
 for
 their
 customers
 solves


the
 problem.
 There's
 like
 a
 usually
 a


pre-negotiated
 rate
 for
 that.
 And
 that


comes
 from
 the
 principle
 that
 in
 the
 age


of
 AI
 software
 isn't
 just
 helping
 you
 be


more
 productive
 but
 actually
 completing


a
 task.
 uh
 what
 is
 the
 right
 and
 logical


business
 model
 for
 something
 that


completes
 a
 task?
 Well,
 charging
 for
 a


job
 well
 done
 rather
 than
 charging
 for


the
 privilege
 of
 using
 the
 software.
 Um


similarly,
 um
 you
 know,
 we
 with
 a
 lot
 of


our
 customers,
 you
 know,
 we
 help
 deliver


them
 a
 fully
 working
 AI
 agent.
 We
 don't


hand
 them
 a
 bunch
 of
 uh
 software
 and
 say


good
 luck,
 you
 know,
 configure
 it


yourself.
 And
 the
 logic
 there
 is,
 you


know,
 in
 a
 world
 where


uh
 making
 software
 is
 easier
 than
 it


ever
 is
 before
 and
 you're
 delivering


outcomes
 for
 your
 customer,
 um
 the


delivery
 model
 of
 software
 probably


should
 change
 as
 well.
 And
 we've
 really


tried
 to
 reimagine
 what
 like
 the


software
 company
 of
 the
 future
 should


look
 like
 and
 trying
 to,
 you
 know,
 model


that
 in
 everything
 that
 we
 do.

>> Do
 you
 think
 we've
 sort
 of
 broken
 dating


in
 a
 way
 where
 I
 I
 mean,
 I've
 been
 on


dates
 with
 people.
 We
 all
 know
 people


who
 are
 I
 wish
 people
 would
 come
 up
 to


me
 and
 ask
 me
 out.
 I
 wish
 I
 didn't
 have


to
 use
 a
 dating
 app.


>> And
 my
 defensive,
 you
 know,
 thinking


immediately
 in
 this
 is
 like
 society
 has


taught
 guys
 not
 to
 approach
 women


anymore.
 What's
 your
 reaction
 to
 that?


>> This
 is
 something
 that
 I'm
 thinking


about
 a
 lot,
 specifically
 with
 Gen
 Z
 and


Gen
 Alpha.
 So,
 I
 was
 recently
 speaking


to
 somebody.
 She's
 a
 16-year-old


entrepreneur
 and
 she's
 trying
 to
 deliver


help
 for
 teen
 daters,
 and
 she
 said
 by


far
 the
 number
 one
 thing
 that
 she
 gets


questions
 about
 is
 how
 to
 deal
 with


rejection.
 And
 so
 I
 am
 genuinely


concerned
 that
 because
 of
 different


societal
 factors,
 because
 of
 people
 who


maybe
 lost
 out
 on
 some
 social
 skills


during
 the
 pandemic,
 because
 of
 people


who
 live
 a
 lot
 of
 their
 lives
 online,


there
 is
 not
 that
 rejection
 resilience


that
 many
 of
 us
 need
 in
 life.
 So
 if
 you


want
 your
 dream
 job,
 you
 need
 to
 go
 out


there,
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 nos,
 and
 go
 after


it.
 You
 don't
 just
 sit
 at
 home
 waiting


for
 a
 LinkedIn
 recruiter
 to
 message
 you


about
 your
 dream
 job.
 That
 that
 doesn't


happen.
 You
 have
 to
 make
 it
 happen.
 And


the
 same
 thing
 is
 true
 with
 dating
 is


that
 you
 have
 to
 shoot
 your
 shot.
 You


have
 to
 approach
 people
 in
 public.
 You


have
 to
 take
 a
 risk.
 And
 so
 I'm


encountering
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 are


very
 afraid
 of
 rejection
 and
 are
 not


taking
 those
 risks.
 And
 I
 think
 that


it's
 leading
 to
 fewer
 relationships.


>> I'm
 a
 make
 it
 happen
 kind
 of
 person
 in


work
 and
 in
 life.


>> I
 also
 know
 that
 that
 can
 come
 off
 as


aggressive
 or
 assertive.


H
 how
 do
 you
 deal
 with
 that?


>> That's
 interesting.
 So,
 what's
 a


scenario
 that
 you
 feel
 like
 could
 come


across
 the
 wrong
 way?


>> Well,
 make
 it
 happen
 is
 like
 you
 have
 a


great
 first
 date
 or
 something
 and
 then


you're
 instantly
 like
 on
 to
 the
 next


date.
 You
 know,
 you're
 like,
 I
 want
 to


see
 you
 again.
 How
 about
 tomorrow?
 And


then
 the
 other
 person,


>> I
 don't
 know.
 Like,
 I
 feel
 like
 we're


just
 in
 a
 society
 now
 where,
 you
 know,


you're
 supposed
 to
 wait
 till
 tomorrow


almost.
 And
 I
 hate
 personally
 waiting.


I'm
 sure
 there's
 other
 people
 out
 there


like
 me,
 too,
 where
 it's
 like,
 no,


you're
 in
 charge.
 You
 have
 agency,
 and


you
 can
 make
 the
 world
 happen.


>> I
 love
 this
 question
 because
 I
 think
 it


speaks
 to
 a
 really
 real
 phenomenon
 where


people
 are
 experiencing
 excitement
 about


somebody,
 but
 they
 feel
 like
 they
 need


to
 hold
 it
 back
 to
 seem
 cool.
 And
 so,
 I


love
 to
 talk
 to
 people
 about
 attachment


theory.
 Has
 that
 come
 up
 on
 your


podcast?


>> No,
 let's
 go
 into
 it.


>> Okay.
 So,
 attachment
 theory
 is
 something


in
 the
 world
 of
 relationship
 science


that's
 truly
 backed
 by
 the
 research.


It's
 something
 that
 first
 came
 about


around
 60
 years
 ago
 with
 someone
 named


John
 Bulby.
 And
 this
 research
 was


originally
 done
 with
 children
 to
 see


their
 attachments
 to
 their
 primary


caregiver.
 But
 now
 we
 have
 an
 entire


field
 of
 adult
 attachment
 specifically


around
 relationships.
 And
 so
 there
 are


people
 who
 are
 anxiously
 attached.
 What


happens
 for
 them
 is
 their
 story
 of
 love


is
 that
 I'm
 going
 to
 chase
 you.
 I
 have


to
 convince
 you
 to
 like
 me.
 you
 might


pull
 away
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 this


chase
 dynamic
 and
 that
 I'm
 constantly


worried
 that
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 be


interested
 in
 me
 and
 you're
 going
 to


disappear.
 So,
 how
 those
 people
 show
 up


in
 relationships
 and
 I
 know
 because
 I


really
 was
 one
 of
 these
 daters
 is
 if
 you


don't
 hear
 back
 from
 somebody,
 you
 start


spiraling,
 they
 met
 somebody
 else,
 they


don't
 like
 me
 anymore,
 you
 send
 a
 bunch


of
 texts
 to
 try
 to
 reconnect
 with
 them


and
 you're
 often
 just
 in
 this
 danger


zone
 where
 you're
 not
 being
 the
 person


that
 you
 want
 to
 be
 because
 you're


trying
 to
 have
 this
 reconnection
 moment.


you
 think
 somebody's
 going
 to
 pull
 away.


Then
 there's
 people
 who
 are
 avoidant


attached.
 They
 sort
 of
 have
 the
 opposite


experience.
 Their
 version
 of
 love
 is
 I'm


going
 to
 be
 smothered.
 I'm
 going
 to
 lose


my
 independence.
 And
 when
 they
 get
 too


close
 to
 somebody,
 they
 are
 the
 ones


pulling
 away.
 So
 they're
 the
 ones,
 you


know,
 great
 sleepover
 on
 a
 Saturday


night,
 Sunday
 morning,
 they
 wake
 up,
 the


person
 hasn't
 left,
 and
 they're
 like,


damn,
 should
 I
 call
 her
 an
 Uber?


>> Oh
 my
 god,
 that's
 me.


>> That's
 you.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 have
 that
 feeling
 of
 like,
 I
 need
 my


space.
 Well,
 I
 need
 my
 space
 and
 I
 don't


want
 to
 get
 hurt.
 There's
 like
 an


element
 of
 vulnerability.


>> Absolutely.
 What
 you're
 talking
 about
 is


complete
 true.
 It's
 not
 that
 those


people
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 in
 intimate


connection.
 It's
 that
 the
 fear
 of
 being


smothered
 or
 the
 fear
 of
 being
 hurt


causes
 them
 to
 pull
 away.
 I'm
 going
 to


reject
 you
 before
 you
 reject
 me.
 And
 so


for
 those
 avoidant
 attached
 people
 who


think
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 smothered


and
 then
 for
 the
 anxiously
 attached


people
 who
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 be


abandoned,
 what
 ends
 up
 happening
 is


they
 often
 date
 each
 other
 and
 they


reinforce
 this
 idea.
 So
 I
 think
 that


love
 is
 a
 chase.
 You
 think
 that
 love
 is


being
 smothered.
 So
 when
 I
 go
 after
 you,


you
 pull
 away.
 That
 reinforces
 mine
 and


that
 reinforces
 yours.
 And
 anxious,


attached,
 and
 avoidant
 people
 keep


dating
 each
 other
 in
 this
 anxious


avoidant
 loop
 that
 leaves
 both
 people


feeling
 pretty
 unhappy.
 But
 there's
 a


third
 type
 of
 securely
 attached
 people.


And
 these
 are
 people
 who
 have
 a
 healthy


relationship
 with
 independence
 and
 with


intimacy.
 I
 want
 to
 be
 close
 to
 you,
 but


I
 also
 respect
 and
 need
 my
 alone
 time.


And
 so
 often
 the
 way
 that
 people
 get
 out


of
 the
 anxious
 avoidant
 loop
 is
 they


either
 become
 more
 secure
 themselves
 or


they
 date
 someone
 who's
 secure.
 And
 so


that's
 what
 happened
 for
 me
 after,
 you


know,
 10
 years
 of
 chasing
 after


different
 people,
 being
 rejected,
 being


disappointed,
 thinking,
 well,
 if
 only
 I


could
 prove
 my
 value,
 then
 this
 guy


would
 like
 me.
 Instead,
 when
 I
 dated


somebody
 who
 was
 secure,
 it
 broke
 a
 lot


of
 those
 patterns.
 And
 we
 formed
 what
 I


feel
 like
 is
 my
 first
 really
 healthy


relationship.
 What
 happens
 is
 50%
 of
 the


population
 is
 secure,
 which
 sounds
 like


a
 good
 thing,
 but
 those
 people
 are
 so


good
 at
 being
 in
 relationships
 that
 they


often
 get
 snatched
 up.
 Then
 you
 have
 the


anxious
 and
 avoidant
 people
 dating
 each


other.
 But
 in
 the
 example
 that
 you


described,
 it
 can
 actually
 be
 very


secure
 for
 somebody
 to
 follow
 up
 after
 a


date
 and
 say,
 "Hey,
 I
 really
 enjoyed


getting
 to
 know
 you.
 I'd
 love
 to
 see
 you


again.
 When
 are
 you
 free?"
 And
 in
 that


moment,
 somebody
 who's
 used
 to
 dating


somebody
 who's
 avoidant
 might
 be
 like,


"Whoa,
 they're
 coming
 on
 too
 strong."


Or,
 "That's
 so
 obvious.
 They're
 so


obviously
 interested.
 That's
 boring."


But
 a
 ton
 of
 the
 work
 that
 I
 do
 is


training
 people
 to
 identify
 secure


partners
 and
 to
 reestablish
 them
 in


their
 heads,
 not
 as
 boring,
 but
 as


secure
 and
 to
 know
 that
 those
 are
 the


people
 to
 go
 after.
 So
 sometimes
 that


person
 who
 pulls
 away
 is
 exciting
 that


sparky
 feeling
 because
 you
 don't
 know
 if


they
 like
 you
 or
 not.
 But
 instead
 really


honoring
 the
 person
 who
 says,
 "I
 like


you.
 I'm
 interested.
 When
 can
 I
 see
 you


again?"
 And
 so
 the
 slight
 tweak
 that
 I


would
 have
 to
 yours
 is
 not,
 "I
 like
 you.


can
 I
 see
 you
 tomorrow?
 That
 does
 kind


of
 feel
 a
 little
 bit
 intense,
 but
 being


clear
 about
 like,
 hey,
 that
 was
 a
 really


great
 date.
 I
 feel
 like
 we
 really


connected.
 I'd
 love
 to
 see
 you
 again.


And
 then
 like
 working
 together
 to
 come


up
 with
 the
 next
 date.
 And
 a
 lot
 of


dating
 that
 people
 miss
 is
 that
 it's


about
 matching
 somebody's
 momentum
 and


matching
 somebody's
 speed.
 So,
 it's
 a


dance
 where
 I
 take
 a
 step
 forward
 and


then
 you
 need
 to
 take
 a
 step
 forward.
 If


I
 take
 10
 steps
 forward,
 you
 might
 feel


overwhelmed
 and
 take
 a
 step
 back.
 So


just
 paying
 attention
 to
 are
 you
 always


the
 one
 reaching
 out?
 Are
 you
 always
 the


one
 making
 plans?
 There
 needs
 to
 be


momentum
 matching
 for
 the
 speed
 to
 feel


right
 to
 both
 people.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 the
 big
 thing
 about


preparation
 and
 success
 is
 is
 the
 price


has
 to
 be
 paid
 in
 advance.
 You
 have
 to


put
 in
 the
 work
 before
 you
 get
 any


results.
 So
 there's
 no
 way
 to
 to


honestly
 know
 how
 good
 your
 preparation


is
 or
 isn't.
 Um,
 that's
 why
 I
 always
 try


to
 emphasize,
 keep
 preparing,
 keep


working.
 Um,
 you
 don't
 know
 what
 the


other
 guy's
 doing.
 He
 might
 be,
 you


know,
 working
 just
 as
 hard
 as
 you
 are.


And
 and
 that
 preparation,
 you
 know,
 it


can't
 be
 after
 the
 fact
 or
 like,
 "Oh,
 I


wish
 I
 would
 have
 studied
 more."
 It's


too
 late
 at
 that
 point.
 You
 have
 to
 do


it
 on
 the
 front
 end.
 So,
 um,
 getting
 in


condition,
 um,
 you
 know,
 studying,


preparing
 all
 your
 film
 and
 your


opponents
 and
 all
 that,
 like
 those


things
 are
 are
 all
 have
 to
 be
 done
 on


the
 front
 end.
 And,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of


times,
 uh,
 there's,
 I
 would
 say,
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 tendency
 to
 just
 sort
 of


let
 up
 on
 the
 preparation.
 Well,
 I


watched
 some
 film.
 Well,
 I've
 done
 some


extra
 sprints.
 Well,
 I've
 done
 this.


I've
 done
 that.
 Well,
 is
 But
 is
 that


enough?
 You
 know,
 is
 it
 really
 enough?


And
 and
 if
 you
 do
 more,
 will
 it
 make
 a


difference?
 um
 not
 to
 the
 point
 of


diminishing
 returns
 but
 to
 the
 a
 point


of
 you
 know
 comprehensive
 preparation.


So
 um
 that
 that's
 really
 what
 we
 try
 to


try
 to
 um
 uh
 emphasize
 on
 that.


>> The
 way
 that
 I
 think
 about
 that
 is
 sort


of
 that
 you
 know
 the
 pain
 of
 losing
 is


sharp
 but
 it's
 over
 fairly
 quickly.
 But


the
 pain
 of
 regret
 not
 putting
 in
 the


work
 not
 doing
 the
 things
 you
 didn't


leave
 it
 all
 in
 the
 field
 that
 lasts


forever.


>> Exactly.
 That's
 exactly
 it.
 The
 pain
 of


regret
 is
 much
 more
 than
 than
 the
 pain


of
 preparation.
 Absolutely.


>> I
 think
 you
 had
 a
 24-hour
 rule.
 Sort
 of


after
 win
 or
 losses,
 you
 have
 24
 hours


to
 think
 about
 it
 and
 then
 you
 you
 move


on.
 Is
 that


>> That's
 right.
 Yeah.
 You
 play
 the
 game,


you
 go
 back,
 you
 analyze
 it,
 you
 what
 do


we
 do
 well?
 What
 do
 we
 do
 poorly?
 What


do
 we
 need
 to
 do
 better?
 What


adjustments
 should
 we
 have
 made?
 What


coaching
 errors
 did
 we
 make?
 And
 so


forth.
 And
 and
 then
 you
 you
 factor
 all


that
 into,
 you
 know,
 how
 does
 that


affect
 us
 next
 week?
 Sometimes
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 carryover.
 Sometimes
 the
 play


team
 you
 play
 the
 following
 week
 is


completely
 different.
 And
 some
 of
 those


lessons
 may
 not
 really
 become
 applicable


for
 a
 week
 or
 two
 weeks
 or
 three
 weeks


until
 you
 see
 a,
 you
 know,
 a
 similar


type
 of
 opponent.
 Um,
 say
 like
 a


scrambling
 quarterback,
 you
 know,
 maybe


you
 play
 two
 or
 three
 weeks
 where
 those


quarterbacks
 aren't
 too
 mobile.
 and
 when


you
 get
 up
 against
 another
 scrambling


quarterback,
 you
 go
 back
 and
 look
 at,


hey,
 how,
 you
 know,
 how
 how
 do
 we
 need


to
 to
 handle
 this
 better
 uh
 against
 this


type
 of
 an
 opponent.
 So,
 um
 but
 yeah,


you
 look
 at
 all
 those
 things
 after
 24


hours,
 win
 or
 lose
 or
 draw,
 uh
 you
 you


take
 your
 lessons
 and
 and
 you
 decide
 how


you're
 going
 to
 incorporate
 any
 of
 those


things
 into
 this
 week's
 preparation
 and


practice.
 Uh
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 do


differently
 or
 maybe
 do
 more
 of
 or
 do


less
 of,
 whatever
 it
 is.
 Um,
 and
 then


you're
 done
 with
 that
 and
 you
 move
 on
 to


your
 opponent
 and
 and
 spend
 the
 next
 uh


5
 days,
 6
 days,
 whatever
 it
 is
 of
 just,


you
 know,
 digging
 in
 on
 that
 opponent


and
 and
 what
 they
 do.


>> Talk
 to
 me
 about
 the
 relationship


between
 the
 best
 talent
 in
 the
 world


and,
 you
 know,
 you're
 playing
 in
 the


NFL,
 you're
 coaching
 in
 the
 NFL
 and


confidence.


>> Well,
 again,
 it's
 all
 relative,
 you


know,
 Shane.
 I
 mean,
 as
 good
 as
 um
 as


good
 as
 as
 the
 players
 are
 in
 the
 NFL,


um
 the
 guys
 on
 the
 other
 side
 of
 the


ball
 are
 pretty
 good,
 too.
 And
 uh
 you


know,
 I'd
 say
 every
 team,
 generally


speaking,
 every
 team
 has
 about,
 you


know,
 five
 or
 six
 players
 that
 are


elite,
 have
 elite
 payments,
 elite


contracts.
 Uh,
 and
 then
 you
 might
 have


some
 younger
 players
 in
 their
 first


through
 fourth
 year,
 you
 know,
 two
 or


three,
 four,
 whatever
 those
 that
 are


elite
 players
 that
 just
 haven't
 hit


those
 top
 contracts
 yet.
 Um,
 but
 they


don't
 necessarily
 match
 up
 in
 the
 same


position.
 You
 might
 have
 a
 tackle,
 I


might
 have
 a
 guard,
 you
 might
 have
 a


linebacker,
 I
 might
 have
 a
 a
 corner,
 and


so
 forth.
 Um,
 so,
 uh,
 the
 way
 those


elite
 players
 match
 up
 is
 is
 very,
 um,


specific
 from
 game
 to
 game.
 and
 how
 you


want
 to
 match
 them,
 your
 your
 matches


against
 theirs
 and
 how
 you
 want
 to
 deal


with
 that
 is,
 you
 know,
 that's
 a
 big


part
 of
 it.
 I
 think
 the
 confidence
 thing


is
 really
 um
 interesting.
 I
 think
 what


really
 separates
 the
 great
 players
 um
 is


their
 ability
 to
 do
 it
 even
 when
 the


bull's
 eyes
 on
 their
 back
 every
 week.
 Um


like
 it
 was
 with
 Tom
 Brady,
 like
 it
 was


with
 Lawrence
 Taylor,
 like
 it
 is
 with


Patrick
 Mahomes,
 um
 like
 it
 is
 with,
 you


know,
 players
 like
 that,
 Lamar
 Jackson


and
 so
 forth.
 every
 week
 the
 the
 teams


are
 geared
 towards
 stopping
 those


players
 and
 game
 planning
 against
 them


or
 putting
 their
 best
 guy
 on
 them
 or
 or


however
 they're
 going
 to
 handle
 them
 and


for
 those
 players
 to
 continue
 to
 be


productive
 um
 in
 spite
 of
 the
 game
 plan


attention
 they
 get
 is
 is
 what
 truly


makes
 those
 players
 you
 know
 great
 and


elite
 and
 I
 I
 think
 that
 um
 you
 know


when
 we
 had
 Kobe
 Bryant
 come
 in
 and
 talk


to
 our
 team
 I
 think
 it
 was
 around
 2018


19
 somewhere
 in
 there
 And
 you
 know,
 Kobe


talked
 a
 lot
 about
 evolving,
 you
 know,


and
 he
 said,
 um,
 you
 know,
 look,
 when
 I


was
 22,
 23,
 you
 know,
 I
 could
 just
 get


the
 ball
 and
 drive
 by
 anybody
 and
 and


score.
 And
 he
 said,
 I
 can't
 do
 that


anymore.
 I
 still
 score,
 but
 I
 found


different
 ways
 to
 score,
 moving
 without


the
 ball,
 jump
 shots,
 and,
 you
 know,


being
 better
 in
 pick
 situations
 and
 all


those
 kind
 of
 things.
 um
 that
 you
 know


he
 said
 I
 found
 I
 found
 ways
 to
 evolve


my
 game
 um
 because
 I
 just
 couldn't
 do


the
 things
 I
 used
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 as


well
 um
 but
 there
 are
 other
 things
 I


found
 that
 I
 can
 actually
 do
 better
 and


I
 thought
 that
 was
 a
 great
 message
 for


all
 of
 us
 to
 hear
 that
 as
 we


um
 you
 know
 as
 as
 we
 go
 through
 our


careers
 do
 the
 things
 that
 are
 working


do
 the
 things
 that
 you
 can
 do
 well
 but


also
 evolve
 continue
 to
 learn
 continue


to
 you
 know
 find
 ways
 to
 to
 be


productive
 that
 are
 maybe
 a
 little
 out


of
 your
 comfort
 zone
 or
 um
 are
 not
 um


you
 know
 habitual
 for
 you
 now,
 but
 if


you
 can
 become
 good
 at
 them
 um
 they
 can


be
 great,
 you
 know,
 great
 tools
 for
 you.


Are
 there
 any
 other
 people
 that
 you


brought
 to
 speak
 from
 sort
 of
 different


sports
 that
 sort
 of
 had
 a
 different


message
 that
 resonated
 with
 you
 or
 the


team
 and
 just
 stands
 out
 in
 your
 mind?


>> Oh
 yeah,
 we
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 them.
 Yeah,
 we


had
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 and
 and
 and
 it
 was


great
 because
 you
 know
 the
 guys,
 you


know,
 they
 hear
 a
 lot
 of
 football


stories,
 but
 it's
 good
 to
 hear
 other


ones.
 Uh,
 one
 of
 the
 ones
 I
 thought
 was


particularly
 entertaining.
 Couple
 of


them,
 one
 was
 uh
 Paul
 Asante.
 They
 won


like
 14
 national
 championships
 in
 a
 row.


They
 won
 like60ome


games
 in
 a
 row,
 matches
 in
 a
 row.
 I


mean,
 and
 at
 the
 Patriots,
 we
 were


favored
 in
 almost
 every
 game,
 you
 know,


not
 every
 game,
 but
 most
 every
 game
 for


quite
 a
 while.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 I


brought
 coach
 Asante
 in.
 I
 said,
 you


know,
 here's
 a
 guy
 that's
 won
 like
 13


straight
 national
 championships.
 They


won
 16ome
 matches
 in
 a
 row.
 I
 mean,
 you


talk
 about
 being
 favored
 now.
 Like,


they're
 favored.
 And
 and
 and
 like,
 let's


listen
 to
 what
 that's
 really
 like.
 And


he
 was
 great.
 He
 talked
 about
 it.
 It


doesn't
 matter
 whether
 you
 are
 or
 aren't


or
 how
 many
 you
 have
 or
 haven't
 won.


Every
 day
 is
 an
 opportunity.
 You
 make


the
 most
 out
 of
 each
 day
 and
 you
 just


get
 better
 each
 day.
 and
 you
 don't
 worry


about
 what
 you've
 done
 in
 the
 past.
 You


just
 you
 look
 at
 today's
 opportunity
 and


make
 the
 most
 out
 of
 it.
 It
 was
 great.


So,
 one
 of
 our
 co
 one
 of
 our
 players


sticks
 his
 hand
 up
 and
 says,
 "Hey,


coach,
 I
 have
 a
 question.


What's
 squash?"
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 a


vegetable.


Hey,
 Jimmy
 Johnson,
 you
 know,
 we
 were


going
 into
 the
 playoffs
 and
 and
 Jimmy


came
 up
 and
 he
 was
 doing
 a
 um
 you
 know,


a
 story
 on
 somebody
 and
 I
 said, "Hey,


would
 you
 mind,
 you
 know,
 talking
 to


teams?"
 Said,
 "Sure."


So
 he
 said,
 "Yeah,
 let
 me
 tell
 you
 a


little
 playoff
 story
 here."
 You
 know,


when
 I
 was
 in
 Dallas,
 we
 were
 getting


ready
 for
 the
 playoffs
 and
 we
 were
 in
 a


special
 teams
 meeting.
 I'm
 standing
 in


the
 back
 and
 I
 see
 I
 see
 one
 of
 our
 one


of
 our
 players
 back
 there
 kind
 of
 dozing


off
 and
 and
 not
 paying
 attention.
 And
 he


said
 he
 wasn't
 a
 he
 wasn't
 a
 starter,


but
 he
 played
 in
 special
 teams.
 And
 he


said
 it
 just
 really
 annoyed
 me.
 And
 so
 I


went
 over
 I
 flipped
 on
 the
 lights,
 turn


the
 lights
 on
 meeting.
 And
 I
 went
 over


to
 him.
 I
 said,
 "That's
 it.
 You
 fall


asleep
 in
 this
 meeting.
 Uh
 we
 don't
 want


you.
 this
 is
 your
 primary
 job.
 You
 take


your
 playbook
 and
 and
 go
 see
 a
 general


manager.
 You're
 done.
 You're
 cut
 and


everybody
 like,
 whoa,
 you
 know,
 that


that
 woke
 everybody
 up.
 And
 you
 know,
 it


was
 right
 before
 the
 playoffs.
 So,
 you


know,
 any
 questions?
 Um,
 yeah,
 coach.


Um,
 what
 would
 you
 have
 done
 if
 that
 had


been
 Troy
 Aman?


Jimmy
 said,
 "Well,
 I
 wouldn't
 have


turned
 on
 the
 lights.
 I
 probably
 would


have
 gone
 over
 to
 him
 and
 nudged
 him
 and


said
 like,
 "Hey,
 Troy,
 pay
 attention."


And
 the
 message
 was


if
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 pelts
 on
 the
 wall,


you
 you you
 might
 have
 a
 little
 more


slack.
 If
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 pelts


on
 the
 wall,
 you
 don't
 have
 any
 room.


You
 don't
 have
 any
 room.
 You
 can't
 live


on
 what
 you've
 done
 because
 you
 haven't


done
 enough.
 You
 better
 know
 where
 you


are.
 And
 until
 if
 you're
 Troy
 Eggman
 and


Tom
 Brady,
 you
 you
 he
 go
 but
 he
 goes


those
 guys
 would
 never
 do
 that
 anyway.


But
 you
 that
 you
 might
 be
 able
 to


survive
 that.
 But
 if
 you
 if
 you
 don't


have
 that
 kind
 of
 resume,
 you
 haven't


had
 that
 kind
 of
 production
 for
 this


team.
 So
 you
 nobody
 wants
 that.
 You're


replaceable.
 They'll
 find
 somebody
 else


who
 will
 stay
 awake
 in
 the
 meetings
 and


who
 will
 be
 more
 attentive.
 And
 uh
 it's


pretty
 funny.
 I'd
 just
 nudge
 him
 and


say,
 "Hey,
 pay
 attention."
 As
 a
 leader,


you've
 called
 yourself
 blunt
 and
 direct


when
 delivering
 a
 message
 to
 people.
 I'm


curious
 what
 you've
 learned
 about


delivering
 a
 message
 that
 gets
 heard.


You
 know,
 it's
 a
 evolving
 process
 if
 you


want
 to
 call
 it
 that.
 Sometimes
 you


people
 deliver
 messages
 that
 are
 not


heard
 because
 you
 haven't
 really


delivered
 the
 message
 clearly.
 People


actually
 come
 out
 of
 performance
 of


praise
 and
 say,
 "I
 think
 I'm
 doing
 a


good
 job."
 and
 you're
 going,
 "Oh
 my
 god,


I
 hope
 that's
 not
 what
 you
 heard."


You're
 saying
 to
 yourself
 because
 this


person
 was
 supposed
 to
 have
 told
 you
 the


three
 or
 four
 things
 areas
 that
 you're


supposed
 to
 improve
 upon
 and
 the
 three


or
 four
 things
 that
 you
 did
 wrong,


you're
 supposed
 to
 have
 gotten
 very


direct
 feedback.
 People
 don't
 like


conflict.
 People
 don't
 like
 to
 deal
 with


issues
 directly.
 They
 like
 to
 beat


around
 the
 bush
 and
 then
 leave
 saying,


"I
 think
 I
 gave
 the
 person
 the
 message."


I
 had
 the
 opposite
 perspective
 which
 is


give
 the
 message
 do
 it
 in
 a
 supportive


way
 and
 make
 sure
 that
 whatever
 you
 tell


them
 they
 have
 to
 work
 on
 you
 help
 them


get
 to
 that.
 So
 I
 chose
 to
 write


performance
 appraisals
 which
 said
 this


is
 what
 you've
 done
 well.
 This
 is
 where


I
 think
 you
 didn't
 do
 well.
 This
 is
 what


you
 need
 to
 work
 on.
 And
 if
 you
 were
 to


work
 on
 these
 issues
 and
 show
 progress,


this
 is
 where
 you
 could
 go.
 So
 you
 see


what
 this
 letter
 did
 was
 celebrate
 them


for
 what
 they
 did
 well.
 Told
 them
 what


they
 didn't
 do
 well.


Told
 them
 the
 three
 or
 four
 things
 they


had
 to
 demonstrate
 progress
 on
 in
 the


next
 year
 and
 how
 I
 was
 going
 to
 help


them.
 And
 then
 also
 told
 them
 if
 you


showed
 progress
 this
 is
 your
 trajectory


because
 if
 we
 don't
 do
 it
 I
 think
 we're


not
 getting
 the
 best
 out
 of
 people.


>> There's
 a
 kindness
 and
 clarity.


>> Toughness
 kindness
 and
 clarity.
 All


three.
 But
 don't
 forget
 the
 toughness


because
 you're
 confronting
 them
 and


saying,
 you
 know,
 I
 asked
 you
 to
 really


get
 to
 know
 the
 international
 markets.


You
 made
 two
 trips
 internationally
 last


year
 and
 each
 trip
 in
 three
 days
 you


came
 right
 back.
 How
 could
 you
 have


learned
 international
 markets
 without


getting
 out
 of
 the
 office
 in
 the
 US?


Okay.
 And
 then
 you
 write
 saying,
 I'd


like
 you
 to
 visit
 the
 following


countries
 next
 year.
 And
 when
 you
 visit


those
 countries,
 make
 sure
 you
 go
 down


to
 this
 level
 of
 detail.
 You
 know,
 some


people
 would
 say
 a
 CEO
 shouldn't
 be


getting
 to
 that
 level
 of
 detail.
 Yeah,


they're
 right.
 But
 if
 I
 truly
 care
 about


this
 executive
 and
 I
 think
 they
 have


great
 potential,
 I
 will
 get
 to
 that


level
 of
 detail
 and
 I
 will
 monitor
 it


middle
 of
 the
 year
 and
 say,
 "Hey,
 did


you
 make
 any
 international
 trips?
 Did


you
 follow
 anything
 I
 said?"
 And
 if
 they


say,
 "Nah,
 I
 really
 don't
 want
 to
 go."


Then
 you
 go
 there.
 You
 know,
 you
 don't


have
 the
 potential
 to
 be
 a
 CEO.
 From
 the


outside,
 we
 hear
 these
 stories
 about
 how


CEOs
 pay
 attention
 to
 the
 top
 50
 of
 the


top
 100.
 How
 many
 people
 inside
 were
 you


really
 monitoring
 and
 trying
 to
 develop


and
 having
 a
 personal
 a
 real
 onetoone


personal
 relationship
 where
 you're
 doing


this
 and
 you're
 in
 the
 weeds
 and
 you're


in
 the
 performance
 report
 and
 you're


trying
 to
 build
 them.


>> I
 think
 there's
 about
 three
 or
 400
 that


were
 corporate
 assets
 and
 one
 watch
 them


all
 the
 time
 because
 these
 are
 people


who
 in
 15
 years
 could
 be
 CEO.
 There's


something
 about
 them
 that
 you
 know
 you


sort
 of
 caught
 your
 fancy
 when
 you
 were


in
 a
 meeting
 or
 uh
 in
 some
 project
 that


they
 were
 on
 they
 had
 brilliant
 ideas


not
 brilliant
 ideas
 that
 reinforced
 your


thinking
 brilliant
 ideas
 that
 challenged


your
 thinking
 and
 took
 us
 to
 a
 better


place
 because
 you
 don't
 want
 yes
 people


around
 you
 um
 you
 want
 people
 who
 say


why
 don't
 we
 push
 the
 boundaries
 of
 our


thinking
 what
 if
 we
 approached
 this


creatively
 and
 people
 who
 put
 the


company
 before
 themselves
 I
 look
 for


that
 all
 the
 time
 And
 so
 there
 were


three
 or
 400
 people
 that
 we
 actually


called
 them
 corporate
 assets
 and
 we


tracked
 them
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 game


planned
 them,
 gave
 them
 the
 right


assignments
 and
 even
 if
 they
 couldn't


move,
 could
 we
 give
 them
 interesting


assignments
 so
 that
 they
 could
 get
 the


experiences
 without
 constantly
 moving.


So
 that's
 the
 number
 of
 people
 that
 we


tracked.


>> What
 were
 the
 signs
 that
 somebody
 was


putting
 the
 company
 ahead
 of
 themselves?


they
 would
 put
 their
 hand
 up
 for


difficult
 assignments


>> and
 um
 if
 something
 went
 wrong
 they


didn't
 look
 for
 somebody
 else
 to
 blame.


They
 would
 take
 the
 blame
 and
 say
 hey


you
 know
 I
 could
 have
 done
 a
 different


job
 or
 I
 could
 have
 led
 differently
 or
 I


could
 have
 staffed
 my
 team
 differently.


Um
 these
 are
 people
 who
 would
 come
 to
 me


and
 say
 you
 know
 whatever's
 going
 on
 in


this
 other
 part
 of
 the
 company
 I
 think


may
 be
 putting
 something
 in
 jeopardy
 and


I'm
 not
 throwing
 them
 under
 the
 bus.


would
 it
 be
 okay
 with
 you
 if
 I
 went
 and


worked
 with
 them
 to
 perhaps
 write


things?
 And
 I
 say,
 be
 careful
 how
 you
 do


it,
 but
 go
 for
 it.
 And
 I
 will
 tell
 them


that
 I
 didn't
 send
 you
 there,
 that
 you


were
 doing
 it
 out
 of
 your
 own
 uh
 good


nature.
 Otherwise,
 people
 say,
 "Oh,
 the


CEO's
 got
 some
 pets
 that
 she's
 sending


our
 way."
 So,
 you've
 got
 to
 be
 very


careful
 how
 you
 deal
 with
 organizational


dynamics.
 But
 these
 are
 people
 who
 look


around
 themselves
 and
 are
 constantly


looking
 for
 ways
 to
 improve
 the
 company


as
 opposed
 to
 how
 do
 I
 get
 the
 next


promotion,
 the
 next
 raise.


>> You
 said
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 don't
 read
 the


footnotes
 or
 the
 financial
 statements.


Is
 that
 changing
 in
 a
 world
 of
 AI
 where


you
 can
 sort
 of
 like
 download
 the


financial
 statement,
 pop
 it
 into
 AI
 and


say,
 "What
 do
 I
 need
 to
 know?"


>> I
 think
 it's
 actually
 exacerbating
 the


situation.
 Oh,
 spend
 a
 few
 beats
 on
 the


>> because
 now
 read
 the
 financial


statements,
 Anthony.
 I
 just
 put
 it
 into


AI.
 I
 ask
 chat
 GPT
 to
 tell
 me
 what
 about


this?
 Look
 for
 that.
 Look
 for
 that.
 And


there's
 there's
 all
 the
 instances
 of


those
 things
 and
 then
 I
 just
 read
 it
 and


it's
 all
 there.
 Well,
 did
 the
 AI
 miss


it?
 Did
 the
 AI
 understand
 the
 linkages


between
 each
 of
 those
 sightings?
 If
 I'm


if
 I'm
 looking
 at,
 for
 example,
 I
 was


looking
 at
 a
 company
 recently
 and
 I
 was


looking
 at
 it
 was
 capitalizing
 costs.


Okay,
 this
 is
 a
 REIT.
 And
 if
 it


capitalizes
 cost
 versus
 putting
 them


through
 the
 income
 statement,
 if
 it
 goes


through
 the
 income
 statement,
 it
 makes


their
 operating
 earnings
 look
 poor,


lower,
 and
 their
 net
 EPS
 ultimately.
 But


if
 they
 put
 it
 on
 the
 balance
 sheet,


well,
 you
 know,
 that's
 an
 investment
 in


the
 future
 and
 everything
 looks
 okay,


right?
 And
 so
 there's
 a
 gray
 area.
 Was


it
 an
 operating
 expense
 or
 was
 it
 a


capital
 item?
 And
 so
 I
 was
 first
 thing
 I


looked
 for
 was
 capitalized
 interest.
 And


so
 it
 gave
 me
 all
 the
 quotes
 and
 then


capitalized
 costs
 and
 gave
 me
 all
 the


quotes.
 So
 then
 you
 think
 that
 that's


enough.
 But
 you
 have
 to
 then
 and
 I
 and
 I


was
 showing
 one
 of
 my
 guys
 this.
 I
 said,


"So
 then
 let's
 go
 to
 the
 income.
 Let's


actually
 pull
 up
 the
 statements
 where
 it


told
 us
 to
 go
 because
 AI
 made
 it
 faster.


I
 now
 no
 longer
 needed
 to
 flip
 the
 300


pages,
 but
 it
 it
 gave
 me
 where
 to
 go.
 So


now
 I
 went
 there
 and
 now
 I
 could
 say,


well,
 that
 means
 if
 that
 is
 what's


happened,
 then
 we
 need
 to
 look
 at
 this


other
 note
 to
 see
 what,
 you
 know,
 the


implications
 of
 that.
 And
 then
 we
 got
 to


look
 at
 the
 cash
 flow
 statement
 to
 see


how
 it's
 actually
 impacting
 what
 ends
 up


being
 reported
 as
 as
 cash
 flow.
 And
 so


those
 linkages
 come
 it
 the
 AI
 makes
 me


get
 to
 the
 answer
 perhaps
 more
 quickly


but
 it's
 my
 if
 I
 don't
 already
 know


where
 I
 want
 to
 go
 then
 AI
 just
 gives
 me


information
 but
 that
 information
 doesn't


help
 my
 decision
 if
 I
 didn't
 start
 with


where
 I
 want
 to
 get
 to


>> and
 it
 sounds
 like
 that
 information


doesn't
 help
 your
 decision
 if
 you
 don't


know
 the
 second
 third
 fourth
 order


consequence


>> 100%
 this
 is
 I
 love
 it
 if
 that's
 where


investors
 go
 and
 that's
 where
 they're


going
 everything's
 going
 to
 AI.
 The
 the


bottom
 level
 of
 being
 an
 analyst,
 the


junior
 analyst
 is
 is
 going
 to
 be


replaced
 by
 an
 AI.
 The
 one
 that
 said,


"Find
 me
 all
 the
 references
 of,
 you


know,
 where
 the
 company
 capitalized


costs."
 That
 the
 AI
 can
 do.
 I
 get
 it.


But
 you
 need
 someone
 with
 experience
 to


know
 what
 which
 of
 those
 references


matter
 and
 to
 what
 that
 means
 to
 the


business.


And
 this
 brings
 about
 a
 number
 of


challenges
 because
 well
 if
 that
 junior


person
 doesn't
 learn


doesn't
 get
 on
 the
 in
 on
 the
 ground


floor
 they'll
 never
 learn
 to
 be
 able
 to


make
 all
 those
 connections


>> and
 the
 only
 way
 to
 learn
 is
 sort
 of


like
 being
 in
 the
 weeds
 and
 not
 being
 in


a


>> yes
 in
 fact
 it
 ties
 to
 so
 many
 things
 I


I
 with
 my
 own
 children
 I've
 seen
 growing


up
 when
 we
 went
 to
 school
 and
 we
 were
 in


elementary
 school
 we
 would
 be
 you
 know


we'd
 have
 to
 do
 the
 math
 tables
 and
 and


recite
 them.


>> Yeah.


>> 2
 *
 2
 is
 four
 and
 so
 on.
 I
 remember
 I


was
 struggled
 with
 my
 with
 my
 nine
 times


table
 and
 then
 my
 12
 times
 table
 and
 so


I
 had
 to
 memorize
 them
 and
 get
 them


going.
 But
 then
 my
 children
 came
 along


and
 they
 were
 using
 a
 calculator
 and


apparently
 that
 was
 okay.
 I
 went


bananas.
 I
 said
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 use


the
 calculator.
 You
 need
 to
 learn
 it


without
 the
 calculator
 and
 then
 you
 can


use
 the
 calculator.
 Which
 is
 the
 same


with
 AI.
 You
 need
 to
 understand
 how
 the


financial
 statements
 are
 prepared.


understand
 the
 linkages,
 develop
 mental


models
 so
 that
 when
 the
 AI
 gives
 you


information,
 you
 can
 you
 can
 digest
 it


and
 make
 decisions.
 Reminds
 me
 of
 this


funny
 story.
 When
 I
 started
 university,


uh
 I
 ended
 up
 in
 first
 year
 calculus.


And
 for
 whatever
 reason,
 the
 professor


who
 was
 supposed
 to
 teach
 that
 class


couldn't
 teach
 it.
 So,
 the
 dean
 of
 the


math
 department
 took
 over.
 And
 on
 the


first
 class,
 in
 the
 first
 like
 minute,


he
 said,
 "There'll
 be
 no
 calculators
 in


this
 class."
 Oh,
 nobody
 of
 course


listened
 to
 him
 cuz
 graphing
 calculator,


you're
 like, "Oh
 my
 god,
 this
 makes
 my


life
 so
 much
 easier,
 would
 show
 up
 to


the
 final
 exam,
 which
 is
 like
 I
 think


80%
 of
 your
 final
 mark."


>> Yeah.


>> And
 on
 the
 front
 page,
 it's
 no


calculators.
 And
 he
 did
 not
 grade
 that


on
 a
 curve.
 And
 it
 was
 not
 pretty
 for


most
 students.
 I
 taught
 at
 university


for
 about
 uh
 14
 years
 at
 York
 and
 uh


truly
 one
 of
 a
 very
 fulfilling
 time
 uh


in
 my
 life
 and
 uh
 I
 still
 love
 doing


guest
 lectures.
 I
 remember
 I
 I
 I
 would


always
 start
 the
 you
 know
 I
 would
 go


over
 the
 outline
 and
 I
 and
 I
 would
 tell


the
 students
 I
 said
 so
 assignments
 are


due
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 class.


>> If
 they're
 handed
 in
 after
 the
 8:30


start
 time
 it's
 a
 zero.
 It's
 a
 zero.


And
 invariably


at
 some
 whether
 it
 was
 the
 first
 and


usually
 the
 first
 or
 second
 assignment,


somebody
 would
 show
 up
 and
 hand
 it
 in


late
 and
 I
 would
 say
 it's
 a
 zero.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 they
 would
 whine
 and
 say
 it's
 how


can
 you
 do
 that
 and
 you're
 so
 draconian?


And
 I
 said,
 'Well,
 you
 think
 in
 the
 real


world
 when
 an
 RFP
 is
 required
 and
 you've


signed
 with
 the
 contract
 with
 a
 client


that
 they
 demand
 a
 report
 by
 9:00
 a.m.


on
 Monday
 and
 you
 show
 up
 at
 9:05.
 How's


that
 look?


And
 somehow
 it's
 okay.
 So,
 it
 wasn't


okay
 in
 my
 class.
 And
 and
 ultimately,
 I


think
 you
 you
 build
 respect
 because


people
 see
 that
 there's
 a
 rule
 and
 it's


followed
 and
 then
 people
 have
 respect


for
 the
 rule.
 There's
 this
 sort
 of
 like


weird
 dichotomy
 I
 think
 with
 students


right
 now
 and
 dichotomy
 is
 probably
 not


the
 right
 word.
 There's
 this
 weird


path
 where
 students
 are
 coming
 out
 and


they're
 more
 powerful
 and
 capable
 than


ever
 because
 they
 use
 AI
 by
 default


>> and
 so
 they
 can
 get
 more
 output
 than


somebody
 who's
 maybe
 been
 in
 their


career
 15
 20
 years.
 And
 I
 I
 use
 my


14year-old
 as
 an
 example.
 You
 know,
 in
 a


world
 where
 he
 never
 had
 to
 show
 up
 to


work,
 he's
 a
 mid-level
 employee
 at
 most


companies
 based
 on
 output.
 If
 you
 never


saw
 him,
 he
 can
 give
 you
 the
 the
 exact


same
 output
 that
 a
 mid-level
 employee
 is


going
 to
 give
 you
 if
 everything
 goes


right.
 But
 the
 minute
 something
 goes


wrong,
 he
 doesn't
 quite
 understand
 all


the
 nuances
 and
 all
 the
 and
 AI
 the
 I


guess
 the
 race
 for
 him
 is
 like,
 will
 AI


catch
 up
 quicker?
 You
 know,
 because
 he


uses
 AI
 by
 default.
 And
 I
 sort
 of
 think


about
 this
 as
 like
 making
 a
 recipe,


right?
 Like
 if
 I
 pull
 out
 a
 cookbook
 and


I
 make
 a
 recipe
 and
 I
 do
 everything


perfectly,
 you
 wouldn't
 be
 able
 to
 tell


the
 difference
 between
 me
 and
 the
 chef.


Like
 the
 food
 maybe
 it's
 not
 plated
 as


well,
 but
 it's
 going
 to
 taste
 great.


It's
 going
 to
 taste
 the
 same.
 You'd
 be


like,
 "This
 is
 amazing."
 But
 if


something
 goes
 wrong,
 if
 the
 oven's
 too


hot,
 if
 I
 don't
 stir
 enough,
 I
 don't
 put


enough
 salt
 in.
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 it


didn't
 go
 right.
 But
 the
 minute
 a
 chef,


the
 chef
 who
 created
 that
 recipe,
 who's


got
 all
 the
 experience,
 who
 did
 the,
 you


know,
 who's
 made
 it
 hundreds
 of
 times,


they
 taste
 it,
 they're
 like,
 "Oh,
 your


oven
 said
 375,
 but
 it's
 actually
 350.


You
 stirred
 this
 too
 much.
 You
 let
 this


boil.
 You
 They
 instantly
 know
 what
 went


wrong."
 And
 I
 wonder
 if
 in
 a
 world
 of


AI,
 that's
 the
 nuance.
 And
 I
 I
 was


talking
 to
 Steve
 Schwarzman
 about
 this


in
 a
 different
 context,
 but
 he
 basically


said,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 analysts


coming
 up,
 they
 know
 the
 numbers,
 but


they
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 numbers
 mean.


>> Correct.
 Experience
 teaches
 you
 judgment


and
 and
 you
 talk
 about
 this
 in
 your


book.
 It's
 all
 about
 the
 mental
 models.


I
 I
 I
 believe
 that
 strongly.
 The


experience
 teaches
 you
 what
 the
 numbers


mean
 as
 we've
 spoken
 about.
 And
 when
 you


have
 experience,
 you
 say,
 "I've
 seen


that
 before."


>> And
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 things
 I
 see
 happening


today
 link
 back
 to
 things
 I've
 seen
 when


I
 started
 my
 career
 over
 the
 last
 30


years.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 something
 that


the
 AI
 can't
 quite
 do
 unless
 you
 tell
 it


where
 to
 look
 because
 it
 doesn't
 know


the
 link
 that
 I'm
 thinking
 about.
 Right?


>> But
 if
 I
 if
 I
 can
 make
 the
 initial


stage,
 it
 can
 help
 me
 get
 there
 quicker


and
 more
 accurately,
 but
 if
 I
 don't
 if
 I


don't
 already
 have
 a
 model
 of
 what
 I'm


looking
 for,
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 get


there.


>> So,
 you
 use
 the
 word
 trust,
 and
 I'm


wondering,
 is
 there
 a
 nuance
 with


likability?
 Cuz
 I
 had
 heard
 before,
 and


I
 don't know
 where
 I
 got
 this
 from,
 but


I
 remember
 reading
 something
 about
 like


we're
 more
 convinced
 by
 people
 we
 like,


and
 you
 use
 the
 word
 trust,
 and
 I'm


wondering
 if
 that
 was
 conscious.
 We're


more
 convinced
 by
 people
 we
 like
 and
 we


like
 people
 that
 we
 trust.


>> Um
 so
 they
 are
 related.
 It
 is
 it
 is


possible
 to
 believe
 someone
 you
 don't


like.
 Right?
 It
 is
 um
 like
 picture


someone
 that
 you
 really
 dislike
 and
 they


say
 they're
 going
 to
 do
 something
 but


you
 immediately
 believe
 that
 they're


going
 to
 do
 it.
 So
 let's
 say
 that


there's
 some
 foreign
 adversary
 who
 makes


a
 threat
 and
 you
 believe
 that
 they'll


follow
 through
 on
 their
 threat
 because


they
 usually
 do
 even
 if
 you
 don't
 like


them.
 That
 is
 possible.
 But
 there


definitely
 is
 a
 link
 between
 um
 if
 you


like
 someone
 you're
 more
 likely
 to


believe
 them
 and
 if
 you
 if
 you
 believe


someone
 you're
 more
 likely
 to
 like
 them.


Uh
 and
 I
 think
 that
 liking
 is
 actually


really
 underrated.
 So
 have
 you
 heard
 of


the
 affect
 heristic?


>> Yeah.


>> It's
 you
 know
 we
 have
 different


decision-m
 heristics.
 We
 have
 mental


shortcuts
 because
 we
 don't
 have
 all
 the


time
 in
 the
 world.
 This
 is
 like
 an


evolutionary
 thing
 that
 everybody
 has


this
 we
 don't
 train
 it
 just
 it
 just


comes
 with
 us
 you
 know
 out
 of
 the
 box.


We
 don't
 have
 all
 the
 time
 in
 the
 world


to
 take
 in
 every
 single
 piece
 of


information
 and
 make
 a
 decision
 all
 the


time.
 Sometimes
 it's
 like
 if
 you
 see


smoke,
 you
 just
 got
 to
 go,
 right?
 And
 so


we
 make
 um
 we
 take
 mental
 shortcuts
 all


the
 time.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 big
 mental


shortcuts
 is
 if
 we
 like
 something
 and


feel
 comfortable
 with
 something,
 it's


more
 likely
 to
 be
 real.
 Someone
 we
 like


is
 more
 likely
 to
 be
 competent.
 Someone


we
 like
 is
 more
 likely
 to
 be
 smart.
 All


these
 things
 just
 kind
 of
 go
 together.


And
 so
 liking
 is
 at
 the
 center
 of
 that.


You
 mentioned
 that
 we
 can
 engineer


trust.
 How
 do
 we
 do
 that?


>> One
 is
 repeated
 exposure.
 So
 in
 order
 to


trust
 somebody,
 first
 you
 have
 to
 have
 a


sense
 of
 who
 they
 are.
 Like
 you
 won't


you
 wouldn't
 trust
 a
 stranger.
 You


wouldn't
 trust
 a
 mystery
 man.
 So
 one
 is


you
 have
 to
 know
 who
 who
 are
 they.
 They


have
 to
 show
 up
 enough
 for
 you
 get
 a
 for


you
 to
 get
 a
 sense
 of
 you
 actually
 know


them
 and
 they're
 not
 a
 total
 stranger
 to


you.
 It's
 hard
 to
 trust
 a
 stranger,
 but


it's
 easy
 to
 trust
 even
 a
 stranger
 that


you
 have
 a
 parasocial
 relationship
 with


because
 they're
 not
 a
 stranger.
 There


are
 people
 that
 you've
 never
 met
 in
 your


life
 who
 would
 trust
 you
 because
 to
 them


you're
 not
 a
 stranger.
 So,
 first
 is
 just


become
 not
 a
 stranger.
 Second
 is


establish
 a
 set
 of
 shared
 values.
 I


wouldn't
 necessarily
 trust
 your
 opinion


on
 a
 restaurant
 unless
 I
 knew
 that
 you


and
 I
 like
 the
 same
 type
 of
 food.
 So
 if


you
 are
 like
 a
 vegan
 that
 hates
 spicy


food
 and
 whatever,
 I
 I
 probably
 wouldn't


take
 your
 restaurant
 recommendation,
 um


even
 if
 I
 like
 you
 as
 a
 person,
 right?


>> So
 you
 you
 have
 to
 establish
 some
 shared


baseline
 of
 values.
 Here
 are
 some
 core


things
 that
 I
 believe
 about
 the
 world


and
 if
 you
 share
 them,
 then
 listen
 to


what
 I
 have
 to
 say
 next.
 If
 you
 don't


share
 them,
 that's
 okay,
 right?
 Not


everybody
 has
 to
 share
 them.
 So
 they


have
 to
 get
 a
 sense
 of
 who
 you
 are
 and


you're
 not
 a
 stranger.
 And
 they
 have
 to


get
 a
 sense
 of
 how
 you
 think
 and
 how
 you


view
 things
 such
 that
 when
 you
 say
 other


things,
 they
 already
 have
 ingrained
 in


their
 mind
 that
 they
 think
 like
 you


think
 and
 therefore
 if
 you
 believe
 this


thing,
 they're
 more
 likely
 to
 believe


that
 thing
 too.
 This
 is
 how
 to
 resolve
 a


debate
 or
 an
 argument.
 By
 the
 way,
 the


better
 way
 to
 argue,
 and
 you
 see
 really


uh
 smooth
 people
 like
 Gav
 Gavin
 Newsome


does
 this
 on
 his
 podcast,
 maybe
 a
 little


bit
 too
 slick,
 but
 he's
 clearly
 very


good
 at
 it,
 is
 he'll
 have
 somebody
 who


totally
 disagree
 with
 with
 him
 on
 a


bunch
 of
 things.
 And
 he'll
 always
 make


sure
 to
 start
 with
 agreeing
 with
 them
 on


something,
 even
 if
 it's
 trivial.
 I
 agree


with
 you
 that
 that
 thing
 was
 totally


insane.
 And
 now
 we
 can
 have
 a
 productive


conversation
 because
 we've
 established


that
 it's
 even
 possible
 for
 you
 and
 me


to
 see
 things
 the
 same
 way
 as
 opposed
 to


your
 knee-jerk
 assumption
 that
 it


wouldn't
 be
 possible.
 I
 wonder
 if
 that's


why
 so
 many
 years
 almost
 never
 disagree


with
 you.
 When
 you
 are
 like
 oh
 I
 taste


whatever
 in
 this
 wine
 they're
 like


possibly
 or
 you
 know
 like
 [laughter]
 in


their
 head
 they're
 like
 no
 way
 like


that's
 completely
 different
 taste
 but


they
 they
 never
 actually
 come
 out
 and


say
 no
 they
 always
 sort
 of
 like
 bridge
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 gaping
 and
 then
 they'll


like
 direct
 you
 or
 steer
 you
 towards


what
 they
 want
 you
 to
 notice.


>> That's
 interesting.
 I'm
 a
 tea
 totler
 so


I'm
 the
 person
 that
 if
 I
 sniff
 a
 wine


I'm
 like
 I
 think
 it's
 wine
 [laughter]


but
 but
 what
 I
 have
 noticed
 which
 is


related
 to
 this
 is
 do
 you
 ever
 see


online
 when
 people
 are
 insulting
 someone


or
 dunking
 on
 someone
 but
 then
 that


person
 shows
 up
 and
 says
 thanks
 for
 your


feedback
 the
 original
 person
 who
 was


insulting
 them
 or
 dunking
 on
 them
 almost


immediately
 folds
 like
 a
 cheap
 suit.


Have
 you
 seen
 this?


>> Yeah.
 almost
 immediately
 they
 fold.
 Hey


man,
 thank
 you.
 No,
 totally
 understand.


I
 would
 be
 doing
 the
 same
 thing.
 I
 got


you.
 Like
 what
 what
 just
 happened?
 And


it's
 because
 once
 you're
 actually


confronted
 by
 a
 person
 instead
 of
 just


like
 a
 concept
 or
 some
 kind
 of
 nebulous


idea
 of
 a
 person
 or
 or
 some


representation
 of
 a
 person
 like
 once
 the


person
 is
 there
 talking
 to
 you,
 even
 if


it's
 online,
 we
 behave
 in
 a
 completely


different
 way.
 And
 so
 one
 of the
 things


I
 tell
 founders
 to
 do
 is
 just
 to
 show
 up


and
 defend
 yourself.
 You
 know,
 defend


your
 people,
 defend
 your
 companies.
 Sam


Alman
 is
 really
 good
 at
 this.
 He
 defends


his
 employees.
 And
 it's
 very
 hard,
 even


as
 much
 as
 with
 any
 public
 figure,


people
 like
 to
 dunk
 and
 hate
 and
 insult.


And
 when
 he
 shows
 up,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 time,


you
 see
 the
 person
 immediately
 fold
 cuz


they're
 just
 like
 flattered
 or
 they


don't
 want
 to
 fight
 with
 him
 directly
 or


something.
 It's
 one
 of
 the
 most
 powerful


things
 is
 just
 to
 put
 a
 human
 in
 their


way.


>> I
 have
 very
 high
 cringe,
 pain
 tolerance,


whatever
 you
 want
 to
 call
 it.
 I
 have
 no


issue
 with
 that
 whatsoever.
 I
 think
 that


there
 is
 this


gets
 easier
 also
 with
 age.
 I
 find
 the


older
 I
 get,
 the
 less
 I
 really
 I
 really


care
 about
 that
 stuff.
 But
 yeah,
 I
 think


most
 people
 are
 not
 willing
 to
 look


stupid
 for
 a
 period
 of
 time.
 I
 think
 the


other
 thing
 is
 that
 I
 think
 about
 this


all
 from
 the
 the
 concept
 of
 like


entrepreneurship.


in
 my
 office
 uh
 here
 here
 in
 Montreal


Shopi
 office.
 I
 have
 the
 original
 screen


print
 uh
 that
 Ben
 Francis
 used
 to
 create


Gym
 Shark.
 It
 was
 a
 gift.
 It's
 a
 super


meaningful
 gift
 that
 he
 gave
 me.
 I
 love


it.
 I
 have
 it
 hung
 up
 in
 my
 office.
 Part


of
 the
 reason
 why
 it's
 up
 there
 is


because
 I
 think
 that
 it's
 an
 amazing


gift
 and
 Gym
 Shark
 is
 this
 homegrown


success
 story
 on
 Shopify.
 It
 exemplifies


everything
 we
 stand
 for.
 It's


incredible.
 But
 the
 other
 reason
 I
 have


it
 up
 there
 is
 because
 what
 most
 people


don't
 know
 is
 that
 that
 was
 not
 Ben


Francis's
 first
 company.
 that
 Ben


Francis
 actually
 had
 a
 bunch
 of
 failed


companies
 before
 he
 landed
 on
 Gym
 Shark.


And
 I
 think
 about
 this
 idea
 of
 this
 cost


of
 failure,
 not
 just
 from


entrepreneurship
 perspective,
 but
 in


general,
 you
 have
 to
 basically
 figure


out
 with
 any
 anything
 you're
 doing,
 what


is
 the
 cost
 of
 failure
 here?
 If
 the
 cost


of
 failure
 is
 really
 high,
 you
 really


have
 to
 think
 about
 it.
 It's
 you
 have
 to


sort
 of
 do
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 like
 the
 math


of
 is
 the
 cost
 of
 is
 is
 the
 benefit
 of


success
 worth
 the
 cost
 of
 failure?
 In


some
 ways,
 it's
 just
 not.


But
 I
 mean,
 for
 $39
 a
 month,
 you
 can


build
 a
 store.
 It's
 not
 a
 pitch
 for


Shopplay,
 but
 $39
 you
 can
 build
 a
 store.


If
 it
 works,
 blow
 it
 up.
 If
 it
 doesn't


work,
 try
 something
 else.
 There
 are


still
 too
 many
 people
 that
 are


apprehensive
 that
 that
 that
 don't
 want


to
 put
 themselves
 out
 there
 because
 of


this
 fear
 of
 failure.
 And


I've
 long
 believed
 that,
 you
 know,


getting
 really
 really
 comfortable
 with


being
 uncomfortable
 is
 magic.
 It's


totally
 magic.
 And
 I
 wasn't
 always
 good


at
 that.
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 need
 to
 be


born
 with
 that.
 I
 think
 you
 can
 learn


that.
 I
 think
 you
 you
 can
 learn


resilience,


but
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 know
 anyone
 that
 I


admire
 who's
 had
 success


who
 has
 not
 gone
 through
 that
 period
 of


making
 kind
 of
 look
 looking
 kind
 of


dumb.
 I
 don't
 have
 you
 ever
 watched
 the


first
 interview
 you've
 ever
 done?


>> Me?
 Oh
 god.
 Yeah.
 I
 wouldn't
 listen
 to


the
 first
 I
 think
 like
 20
 or
 30
 of
 them.


I
 wanted
 to
 get
 a
 catalog
 and
 then
 I


wanted
 to
 listen
 to
 them.


>> Sure.
 And
 then
 I
 I
 went
 for
 like
 a


really
 long
 run
 and
 I
 started
 listening


to
 them
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 god."
 And


it's
 like,
 "I
 should
 have
 asked
 this


followup.
 Why
 did
 I
 phrase
 it
 that
 way?"


And
 um
 like
 you,
 I'm
 incredibly
 hard
 on


myself.
 Came
 back,
 went
 through
 every


transcript.
 And
 like
 I
 was
 like,
 I
 want


to
 get
 better
 at
 this
 for
 everybody


else.
 But
 yeah,


>> there
 is
 no
 secret


to
 why
 you've
 been
 so
 successful
 in
 my


in
 my
 view.
 I've
 known
 you
 now
 for
 a


number
 of
 years.
 You
 you
 simply
 outcare


other
 people.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 outcaring


thing


supersedes
 IQ,
 EQ,


raw
 talent.


>> Double
 click
 on
 that
 for
 a
 second.


>> I
 think
 that
 I
 will
 take
 someone.
 It's


the
 reason
 why
 I
 like
 entrepreneurs
 so


much
 that
 I
 think
 entrepreneurs,
 the


right
 entrepreneurs,
 the
 best


entrepreneurs,
 they
 just
 simply
 outcare


other
 people.
 they
 are
 willing
 to
 if
 you


put
 two
 people
 in
 a
 room
 um
 one
 person


has
 50%
 capacity
 another
 person
 100%


capacity
 but
 that
 100%
 capacity
 person


is
 just
 not
 caring
 as
 much
 of
 50%.
 I


think
 I
 can
 help
 that
 50%
 person
 get


more
 skill.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 I
 can
 change


their
 level
 of
 ambition.
 I
 think
 you
 can


change
 ambition
 but
 I
 think
 like
 sheer


innate
 deeprooted
 ambition
 uh
 which
 call


it
 care
 whatever
 whatever
 nomenclature


you
 want
 to
 use.
 I
 think
 that
 is
 a


superpower


and
 it's
 also
 the
 reason
 why
 when
 I
 meet


someone
 they
 say
 what
 do
 you
 think
 I


should
 do
 with
 my
 life?
 I
 often
 ask


them,
 "What
 what
 do
 you
 do
 for
 fun?"


Because
 often
 the
 what
 you
 do
 for
 fun


question
 ends
 up
 turning
 into,
 "I
 really


want
 to
 be
 a
 fashion
 designer."
 And
 I'm


like, "You
 should
 go
 be
 a
 fashion


designer.
 Even
 though
 you've
 never
 done


it,
 you
 may
 not
 have
 the
 raw
 skills.
 You


will
 learn
 those
 skills,
 but
 you
 seem
 to


really
 care
 about
 this
 thing.
 You're


probably
 going
 to
 be
 good
 at
 it."


>> Is
 there
 a
 difference
 between
 who
 cares


the
 most
 and
 who
 wants
 it
 more
 or
 like


how
 do
 you
 see
 that
 nuance?


>> I
 look
 at
 them
 the
 same
 in
 my
 view.
 Um,


usually
 high
 care
 comes
 from
 high
 intent


or
 high
 uh
 an
 elevated
 level
 of
 desire


to
 succeed.
 I'm
 trying
 to
 teach
 my
 kids


that
 right
 now.
 I
 I
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 You


know,
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 weird,
 but
 I
 kind


of
 wish
 I
 had
 kids
 preipo
 rather
 than


post
 IPO.
 Why?


I
 think


whatever
 success
 that
 I've
 had
 and


success
 of
 of
 of
 things
 I've
 been


involved
 with,


they
 are
 more
 meaningful
 to
 me
 because


obviously
 I
 know
 where
 I
 come
 from.
 I


know
 how
 hard
 it
 was.
 But
 I
 also
 see
 how


Lindsay
 how
 my
 wife


sees
 my
 relationship
 with
 things
 I've


done
 in
 particular
 with
 Shopify.
 Lindsay


has
 great


a
 wonderful
 emotional
 connection.
 It's


Shopify
 for
 Lindsay,
 even
 my
 wife,
 is


not
 just
 a
 company.
 She
 remembers,
 you


know,
 those
 early
 days.
 She
 remembers


those
 like
 being
 on
 top
 of
 Tucker's


Marketplace
 and
 the
 Byward
 Market,
 uh,


the
 office
 stunk,
 like
 the
 buffet


restaurant
 and
 and
 struggling.
 This
 is


preip
 pre
 series
 A
 even.
 And
 and
 I
 I


like
 that.
 I
 love
 that
 she
 knows
 that


she
 knows
 how
 meaningful
 because
 she's


seen
 the
 entire
 journey.
 Um,
 my
 my
 kids


were
 born
 in
 the
 last
 8
 years
 or
 so.


They
 kind
 of
 only
 know
 our
 life
 being


pretty
 good.
 Our
 lives
 changed
 post
 IPO.


I
 don't
 think
 that's
 a
 secret


financially.
 My
 my
 life
 changed
 and
 and


and
 I
 don't
 take
 it
 for
 granted.
 But
 I


kind
 of
 wish
 they
 knew
 what
 Lindsay
 and


my
 first
 apartment
 looked
 like
 in
 in


Ottawa,
 Canada,
 and
 how
 gross
 it
 was.
 It


wasn't
 gross
 because
 it
 was
 dirt.
 It
 was


just
 was
 a
 nice
 apartment
 because
 we


couldn't
 afford
 anything
 else.
 And
 so


what
 I
 often
 what
 Lindsay
 often
 tells
 me


is
 just
 like
 yeah
 the
 kids
 didn't
 see


that
 but
 but
 tell
 them
 those
 stories.


And
 so
 I
 do
 I
 tell
 those
 kids
 I
 tell
 my


daughters
 the
 stories
 of
 those
 early


days
 and
 how
 scary
 it
 was
 and
 we
 didn't


know
 if
 it
 was
 going
 to
 succeed
 or
 not.


And
 I
 want
 them
 to
 see
 that.
 I
 think
 I


don't
 want
 them
 to
 think
 any
 of
 this


came


simply
 because
 it
 was
 fate
 or
 just
 kind


of
 happened
 or
 you
 know
 uh
 I
 mean
 luck


plays
 a
 role
 here
 but


this
 was
 sheer
 grit
 and
 willpower
 and
 it


still
 is.
 Um
 part
 of the
 reason
 why
 I


like
 starting
 these
 small
 project
 like


Big
 Shot
 or
 Firebelly
 is
 I
 I
 want
 the


kids
 to
 see
 that.
 I
 want
 the
 kids
 to
 see


this
 thing
 that,
 you
 know,
 that
 first


episode
 of
 Big
 Shot
 we
 did
 was
 it
 was


Charles
 Bronman.


It
 didn't
 do
 very
 well.
 I
 wasn't
 very


good
 at
 it.
 I
 wasn't
 a
 good
 interviewer.


I
 didn't
 know
 what
 questions
 to
 ask.


Dave
 and
 I
 were
 kind
 of
 awkward
 fumbling


along
 together.
 And
 Bailey,
 my
 eldest,


has
 sort
 of
 memorized
 most
 of
 that


episode.
 And
 now
 she
 watches
 that.
 She


They
 love
 watching
 Big
 Shot.
 They
 also


watched
 the
 most
 recent
 episode,
 Bobby


Kodc,
 who
 built
 Activision
 Blizzard.
 We


put
 that
 out
 last
 week.
 And
 uh
 and
 I


love
 watching
 her
 see
 the
 difference
 in


style
 and
 and
 the
 articulation


because
 I
 want
 her
 to
 know
 that
 like
 all


the
 things
 she
 wants
 in
 her
 life
 she
 can


have
 but
 it
 won't
 be
 easy.
 No
 one's


going
 to
 give
 it
 to
 her
 and
 it's
 going


to
 kind
 of
 suck
 at
 the
 beginning.


Whenever
 you're
 in
 that
 moment
 when


you're
 nervous
 and
 you
 really
 want


something,
 obviously
 the
 best


performance
 comes
 when
 you
 have
 freedom.


But
 it's
 easy
 to
 get
 attached
 to
 that


because
 you're
 like
 thinking,
 okay,
 this


is
 really
 important.
 And
 so
 we
 get


attached
 to
 it
 and
 have
 tension.
 So
 what


you
 can
 do
 is
 ask
 yourself,
 what
 do
 I


want
 more
 in
 this
 moment
 to
 be


successful
 right
 here
 this
 one
 time
 or


to
 get
 better
 at
 these
 moments?
 In
 other


words,
 to
 master
 my
 ego,
 to
 not
 be
 so


caught
 up
 in
 what
 people
 think.
 So,
 what


happens
 to
 most
 people
 is
 that
 they
 come


to
 these
 points
 in
 their
 lives
 where


they're
 really
 uncomfortable.
 Maybe


they're
 giving
 a
 speech
 or
 playing
 ping


pong
 in
 front
 of
 a
 bunch
 of
 people.
 It


doesn't
 matter
 what
 it
 is.
 You
 if
 you're


nervous
 and
 other
 people
 are
 watching,


they
 come
 to
 those
 moments
 where
 they're


really
 uncomfortable
 and
 they
 back
 away


because
 they're
 too
 uncomfortable.


They're
 too
 afraid
 of
 of
 looking
 foolish


in
 front
 of
 others.
 Whereas
 the
 most


successful
 people,
 they're
 willing
 to


look
 foolish.
 They're
 willing
 to
 make


mistakes.
 And
 so,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


people
 know
 that,
 but
 how
 do
 we
 get


there?
 And
 so
 in
 that
 moment,
 it's
 ask


it's
 realizing
 that
 when
 I'm
 the
 most


uncomfortable,
 that's
 the
 moment
 that's


the
 key
 for
 you.
 And
 it's
 it's
 principle


number
 one
 for
 inner
 excellence.


Everything
 is
 here
 to
 teach
 me
 and
 help


me.
 It's
 all
 working
 for
 my
 good.
 So


we're
 going
 to
 go
 look
 for
 those
 moments


when
 you're
 most
 uncomfortable.
 And
 and


say
 and
 remind
 yourself,
 this
 is
 my


teacher.
 And
 inner
 excellence
 is
 about


expanding
 what
 you
 believe
 is
 possible.


There's
 three
 pillars
 of
 inner


excellence.
 Belief,
 freedom,
 and
 focus.


to
 be
 fully
 engaged
 in
 the
 moment,
 have


freedom
 to
 play
 like
 a
 child
 and
 and


expand
 what
 you
 believe
 is
 possible,
 to


become
 to
 do
 things
 you've
 never
 done


and
 become
 someone
 you've
 never
 been
 and


to
 expand
 what
 you
 believe
 is
 possible.


Kind
 of
 that
 crucial
 pillar
 is
 we
 need


to
 find
 those
 moments
 where
 we're


uncomfortable
 and
 we
 need
 to
 embrace


that
 moment.
 And
 the
 way
 we
 do
 it
 is
 we


understand
 that
 the
 key
 thing
 here
 is


not
 the
 outcome,
 but
 it's
 my
 willingness


to
 be
 in
 this
 moment
 and
 not
 back
 away.


It
 doesn't
 matter
 if
 you
 fail
 horribly.


You
 do
 that
 10
 times
 and
 fail
 horribly


10
 times,
 eventually
 you're
 going
 to
 get


comfortable
 in
 those
 moments
 and
 then


your
 skills
 will
 be
 able
 to
 match
 and


break
 through.
 But
 people
 don't
 break


through
 because
 they
 come
 to
 those


moments
 and
 they
 shy
 away.
 I
 mean,
 this


is
 we've
 all
 done
 it.
 I've
 done
 it
 way


too
 many
 times.


>> What
 do
 you
 struggle
 with
 today
 in


relation
 to
 that?
 Anything?


>> Well,
 it's
 the
 same
 thing
 everyone


struggles
 with
 when
 I
 come
 to
 those


moments.
 I'm
 like,
 "Oh,
 I'm
 so


uncomfortable
 right
 now."
 And
 then


sometimes
 I've
 forgotten.
 It's
 like
 I


had
 this
 conversation
 with
 my
 spiritual


mentor
 um
 Nick
 Osborne
 and
 he
 said
 what


God
 does
 is
 he
 gives
 you
 a
 jacket
 that's


two
 sizes
 too
 big
 and
 that's
 what
 a


loving
 parent
 does
 when
 you're
 four
 or


five
 years
 old.
 You
 don't
 buy
 them
 a
 a


jacket
 that's
 perfectly
 fit
 because


they're
 going
 to
 grow
 out
 of
 it
 too


fast.


>> So
 they're
 going
 to
 the
 parents
 going
 to


buy
 them
 a
 jacket
 that's
 a
 little
 bit


too
 big,
 right?
 So
 they
 can
 grow
 into


it.
 And
 he
 said
 that's
 what
 God
 does.
 He


gives
 you
 this
 jacket
 that's
 too
 big
 and


then
 you
 put
 it
 on
 you're
 like
 whoa
 this


is
 not
 good.
 This
 is
 not
 right.
 This


doesn't
 feel
 right.
 What's
 happened?
 And


that's
 what
 I
 felt
 so
 much.
 It's
 like,


okay,
 this
 is
 not
 okay,
 what's


happening.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 get
 it.
 This


is
 uncomfortable.
 But
 God
 did
 that


intentionally.
 He's
 doing
 that


intentionally
 because
 that's
 where
 you


need
 to
 self-reliance
 is
 the
 biggest


problem
 that
 I
 face.
 And
 because
 I've


got
 very
 little
 power.
 I've
 got
 very


little
 ability.
 I've
 I've
 only
 seen
 the


world
 through
 this
 little
 lens
 that
 I've


I
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 see
 all
 of
 reality.


And
 so
 to
 do
 that,
 I
 need
 to
 surrender


my
 little
 power.
 is
 part
 of
 this


reframing
 failure
 into
 there's
 no
 such


thing
 as
 failure.
 It's
 just
 it's
 not
 a


verdict.
 It's
 like
 data.


>> Yeah.
 Redefining
 success
 and
 failure
 for


sure.
 Like
 the
 Hall
 of
 Fame
 linebacker


Brian
 Erlocker
 told
 me
 that
 I
 asked
 him,


"What
 is
 the
 difference
 between
 you
 and


the
 best
 performers
 that
 you've
 ever
 in


NFL
 that
 you've
 ever
 competed
 against?"


And
 he
 said,
 "Most
 NFL
 players,
 they


make
 a
 mistake
 and
 they
 get
 tentative."


>> I
 make
 a
 mistake
 and
 I
 don't
 get


tentative.
 And
 so
 that's
 that's
 that


courage.
 That's
 that
 willingness
 to


fail.
 That's
 that
 relentlessness
 that's


needed.


>> So
 that's
 what
 happens.
 I
 mean,
 it


happens
 with
 people,
 too.
 Like
 if
 you


give
 a
 talk
 at
 work
 and
 you
 know,
 it


doesn't
 go
 quite
 right.
 It's
 in
 your


head
 the
 next
 time
 you
 do
 it.
 So
 you're


less
 likely
 to
 be
 successful
 in
 a
 way.


But
 the
 counterbalance
 to
 that
 would
 be,


okay,
 well,
 what
 do
 we
 do?
 We
 do
 more


preparation.
 We,
 you
 know,
 we
 go
 through


our
 mistake.
 We
 reflect
 on
 it.
 We
 learn


from
 it.
 And
 then
 we
 sort
 of
 like
 let
 go


of
 it,
 move
 on
 so
 we
 don't
 make
 the
 same


mistake
 again.


>> Yeah.
 So
 failure
 that's
 all
 um
 obviously


big
 part
 of
 it
 and
 you
 know
 there's
 one


of
 the
 principles
 the
 presupposition
 is


there's
 no
 failure
 only
 feedback.
 If
 the


emotional
 part
 is
 is
 the
 the
 issue.
 If


there's
 no
 emotional
 aspect
 to
 it
 then


then
 you
 know
 what
 does
 it
 matter
 if
 you


fail.
