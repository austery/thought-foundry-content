Hi everyone, I'm Anthony.
Welcome to my channel
This is our first video of the new year.
Wishing everyone a happy Chinese New Year 2026!
In the previous video
We discussed a somewhat heavy topic.
But it's an incredibly real topic.
That is the conflict between individuality and sociality.
We analyzed two types of idealism
Facing the threats to our personality from the outside world
The first type of idealism is a form of rebellion against worldly involvement.
In the absence of the ability to immediately change the existing system and rules
The parties involved will do their best within the scope permitted by the rules.
Expand your freedom to the best of your ability
Strive to create and build
Even in an extremely small and restrictive space
We should also strive to leave our mark on the product.
The second type of idealism
This refers to any cooperation with secular society.
They all adopted an attitude of disgust and distrust.
Because of any cooperation
All of these are forms of self-pollution and alienation.
Therefore, the individual chooses to retreat.
To enter a completely closed inner world
In this narrow vacuum, detached from reality
Although the self appears pure and clean.
spiritual
But it is also undefined.
It's like a clump of water without a container.
Although clear
But it could be scattered at any time.
This state can create a kind of illusion.
It's as if as long as I don't engage with reality...
I possess infinite possibilities.
And once you have to deal with that mess
An impure real world
Once you are about to accept specific tasks and evaluations
This kind of infinite possibility is greedy.
We would consider that a form of depravity.
Feeling the beauty of my soul
It inevitably got dirty.
Therefore, in order to maintain this illusory perfection
We can only retreat deeper.
Becoming increasingly fragile
After the last video was released
I'm in the comments section.
We received a lot of very insightful and sincere feedback.
Some netizens said
The previous video accurately described their feelings.
It made them understand themselves better.
This is also why I feel that creating this channel is worthwhile.
A place that gives me a great sense of accomplishment
However, I'd also like to clarify a premise first.
The two types of idealism we just discussed
Whether constructive or positive
It's still regression and closure.
It's not about labeling or categorizing people.
It doesn't mean that a certain person belongs to the first category.
The other person is the second type.
Human nature is complex
These two forces
In fact, they exist simultaneously
In the hearts of each of us
Including myself.
Our personality state is not black and white.
Rather, it is during the long process of growth.
Constantly being pulled back and forth between these two states
And it allows us to see the regression and defense within ourselves.
This in itself demonstrates that we have power.
It is open, not closed.
So this video
Let's explore these two states further.
And let's discuss
How to overcome the fear of getting dirty
How to proceed in the inevitable process of socialization
To build a truly solid and powerful
And without losing their creative self
I will upload this video.
Included in the list of "Psychology and Education"
if
Do you have any topics you'd like to discuss or consult with me about?
You can contact me via email to make an appointment.
Actually, after the last video was released...
I also received some dissenting opinions.
For example, some people thought the previous video sounded...
It has a fatherly and lecturing feel to it.
It seems like I'm romanticizing the shackles of the outside world.
It overestimates human initiative.
Because people are faced with the cruel reality of the world
The things we can do are indeed very limited.
I think this viewpoint is also worth discussing.
Those who frequently watch our channel should know...
I never deny
How heavy are the constraints of the external environment?
Even most of the content on our channel
They are all criticizing and analyzing the external society.
Institutions and Culture
Threat to our subjectivity
But what I want to point out today is
Lurking behind these criticisms
An extremely hidden psychology
If we only immerse ourselves in the outside world
How did you persecute me?
Brainwashing my narrative
We will continuously strengthen
A purely receptor perspective
From this perspective
The self has completely degenerated into
A victim of external injury
A passive responder
Even if someone points it out
Our ego, even in dark environments
It is not entirely powerless.
To us, it all sounded like a preaching.
A blind worship of subjectivity
This receptor perspective
Widely appearing
Among various marginalized groups
But it not only fails to protect us
On the contrary, it will make us unintentionally
Depriving oneself of psychological resilience
Seeing oneself as too weak
Because in the deepest part of the subconscious
Although we verbally express our hatred and helplessness
But psychologically
We secretly yearn for powerlessness.
Even worship is powerless
This sounds counterintuitive.
But this is precisely the most subtle defense mechanism in human nature.
Regarding this point
I thought of what happened some time ago.
A book recommended to me by a friend
Nobel laureate in literature
Belarusian writer
Svetlana Alexievich's *Secondhand Time*
In this book
The author truthfully recorded
A special group during the Soviet era
"Elite of the 1960s"
This group
Mainly after Khrushchev's reforms
Soviet intellectuals and party cadres who grew up
In that special era
Their most typical lifestyle is kitchen politics.
Everyone was crammed into the small kitchen.
Criticizing the Soviet government fiercely
Telling exciting Soviet jokes
Secretly listening to BBC broadcasts
Yearning for democratization, capitalism, and the free market
Although government surveillance and wiretapping were ubiquitous at the time
But what's really interesting is...
People actually benefited from this high pressure.
I experienced a secret pleasure.
For example, when engaging in lengthy discussions
There will always be someone half-joking.
Shout at the wall socket
Are you still listening?
Major?
In this dangerous test
They maintain a sense of oppression.
The identity of dissidents
This combination of powerlessness and victim perspective
It endowed them with a lofty sense of moral superiority.
and the sense of purity of the soul
However, the course of history is always full of drama.
When the Soviet Union truly became as these intellectuals wished...
After the sudden disintegration
They did not experience the ecstasy they had imagined.
Instead, it has fallen into a completely new situation.
Even more deadly pain
As one of the interviewees in the book recalled in despair:
"We walked from the kitchen to the street."
turn out
There were no real ideas or ideologies to begin with.
So many years
We just sat there talking big.
It's just empty talk.
I don't know where it came from.
A group of completely unconventional people
A bunch of young guys
Wearing a dark red jacket
Wearing a gold ring
There are also new game rules.
With money, you are a person.
Without money, you are nothing.
Who cares if you've read Hegel thoroughly?
They had no choice but to lower themselves and go into business.
Reselling ice cream on the street
Do some small business to barely make ends meet
What is thought-provoking
At this time
Instead, they began to miss it terribly.
The oppressed person back then
Surveilled kitchen life
They complained
Russia's morals have declined since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Complaining that no one has genuine feelings anymore
Everyone is busy making money.
Of course, Russia in the 1990s
Although it rejected the Soviet system
But it can't really be called democratization.
It is still rife with corruption and oligarchs.
The environment is still very harsh.
But the reason they miss kitchen politics
It wasn't just the unpleasantness of the 1990s.
But in the 1990s
There is no longer a systemic persecutor
In a kitchen in the 1960s
They are spiritual aristocrats
It is Russia's conscience
Although the Soviet government oppressed them
But the government is also like a stern father.
They took care of their most basic survival needs.
For example, the Khrushchev-style housing unit provided a meager but fixed income.
In that small kitchen
The shackles of the system are heavy.
But that very fact became their best disclaimer.
and protective case
Instead, it prevents them from engaging with society.
As long as that massive, corrupt system exists...
Their powerlessness is a noble act.
And once they gained the freedom they had been longing for day and night...
They had no choice but to face it.
The helplessness one feels when facing the real world
Of course, this is a very special case.
But it reveals a universal phenomenon.
That is when a person's self
Based solely on
Above the rejection and resistance to the real world
His ego is empty and fragile.
Because once the enemy disappears...
The ego also collapsed.
Many people have this understanding
They believe
Individuality or idealism
This means that it is necessary to confront universality and sociality.
They think we're a niche group.
People who have seen through the truth of the world
so
We need an absolutely pure
safe space
In a highly homogeneous small circle
To maintain a state of clarity and nobility
In this circle
The secular world outside is all dirty.
Those outside are foolish.
Brainwashed and vulgar
Compromise with society is depravity
In a normal psychological state
We should have focused on and learned from those who are bound by constraints.
Still striving to create people who pursue freedom in the cracks.
However
When we are completely enveloped by the receptor's perspective
A strange psychology emerged.
To avoid all forms of victim blaming
We are starting to go to another extreme.
Begin to praise powerlessness
We feel powerless in the face of harsh reality.
Consider it a most ideal and clear-headed state
For example, in a discussion of the current education system
In a very dissatisfied small circle
People are prone to developing a compensatory sense of superiority.
They would think
Those students with good grades are all high-scoring but low-ability students.
It is a disciplined assembly line product
An unfortunate cog in the machine of involution.
Only by rejecting all of this can one truly achieve this.
That is intelligent, profound and spiritual
Those ones
No one has resolutely severed ties with the mainstream evaluation system.
They are all not truly awakened.
They haven't realized it yet.
A pathetic creature whose spirit is being destroyed.
For example
In a group that deeply resents the current system
People would think
I am surrounded by an endless sea of ​​ordinary people.
To maintain this sober sense of tragic grandeur
A tendency often forms within a circle
To exaggerate and generalize external systems indefinitely
And the terror and omnipotence of the government
They would secretly be happy to see
People outside the circle
That is, those who did not do what they did.
Those who resolutely reject the system suffer misfortune or become victims.
Because only by seeing those who conform pay the price can we truly understand the situation.
Only then can their correctness be proven in reverse.
The same situation
It also commonly appears in the view of patriarchy
In the critique of capitalism
As long as you show even a little bit
Compromise and acceptance of secular rules
Or you showed
Actions and statements that do not conform to the political correctness of the inner circle
You will be immediately expelled from the program.
I certainly think
Many of their criticisms are correct.
and
A person can live outside the mainstream narrative
This is without a doubt.
We live in this world
Everyone needs a small circle of like-minded people.
We all need close friends to keep each other warm.
Resonance
This is our instinct to combat loneliness.
However, if it's a small circle or group
Its bond is not based on joint construction.
Rather, it is based on isolationism, xenophobia, and hatred towards the outside world.
If he potentially does so by despising others
To confirm value and maintain bonds
So this was originally to escape oppression
The established safe space
It has already quietly become
A cage that hinders our growth
Even if it champions freedom, individualism, and democracy
Regarding this point
I am reminded of Hannah Arendt's "Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy"
Evaluation of Kant
She mentioned
When Kant explored human freedom and judgment
A garden that never sees people as isolated
Kant proposed a very interesting concept
It's called an expanded mind.
If a person
Able to perceive from personal, private, subjective emotions
Break free
From a more general perspective
Reflect on your own judgment
To imagine and even understand the other's perspective
Then this person possesses an expanded mind.
True personality
It is about fighting against that rigid, false universality.
To pursue a more inclusive
A broader universality
Instead of fighting against universality itself
Take, for example, the exam-oriented education system that our channel often criticizes.
Let's take an example
In a closed small circle
People criticize exam-oriented education
It often leads to a kind of reverse beautification
That is, to glorify the aversion to the school system.
Resistance and depression
think
That's what true individuality and undisciplined freedom look like.
At the same time, it is believed that those students who are good at getting high scores
They are test-takers who lack inspiration and excel at involution.
I certainly think
Their ideas are valuable and worthy of understanding.
But a person with an expanded mind
When facing those high-scoring students
He wouldn't completely deny or ridicule them.
Instead, they try to understand the other person's inner world.
Then they will find
These students underwent such rigorous training.
indeed
A group of people
Developed logical reasoning ability
Memory and patience for tedious learning goals
This fact
It may not conform to the political correctness of the small circle.
Because in this kind of political correctness
Acknowledge this
mean
Defending and glorifying a flawed education system
But these abilities are equally valuable.
After we see this
Let's think about them under this education system.
What was lost
This critique and reflection on the education system
That is what is truly built upon universal human nature.
Rather than a condescending sympathy
Or the sense of superiority within a small circle
For example
A refined intellectual who loves reading and thinking
It is often easy for business people
Or those who struggle and toil in the secular world.
It generates a sense of intellectual and moral superiority.
In their eyes
A businessman may be full of mercenary shrewdness.
I don't like reading
They are simply adept at catering to human selfishness and greed.
Lack of profound humanistic concern
This perspective certainly has its merits.
But essentially
Or remain in your own safe space
It is a defense
Rather than being based on curiosity and empathy for the other person.
But if this intellectual
Try to expand your mind
Daring to experience a kind of spiritual self-denial
He might see
These businessmen
It possesses some universal virtues that intellectuals lack.
For example, despite their lack of theoretical knowledge
But it possesses a kind of practical wisdom.
They need to deal with a large amount of extremely trivial and mundane matters every day.
Even annoying mundane tasks
To deal with various complex calculations
But in the daily consumption
They did not collapse
Instead, they are able to pragmatically persevere.
If we set aside a certain lofty perspective
We must acknowledge that this is a form of psychological resilience.
They may not care so much about ideas and values.
More focus on interests
Intellectuals, on the other hand, are more likely to prioritize morality and theory.
But this could lead to a kind of theoretical self-enclosure.
That is, as long as reality does not conform to my moral fastidiousness.
As long as this person doesn't seem pure enough
I immediately blocked him in my mind.
But the logic of the real world
It often runs in grayscale.
On someone I look down on
It may also have universal advantages that I need to learn.
Those that seem less pure, those that involve compromise
Even actions that are flawed in the eyes of those with a strong sense of moral purity
In the clash of reality
It is entirely possible to facilitate concrete cooperation.
It can even bring about good results.
Acknowledging these things will not destroy our self-identity.
It will not make us vulgar or immoral.
On the contrary, it will make us stronger.
To become a more well-rounded person
When I actually saw
And they acknowledged these powers within them.
Let's examine the limitations of their existence.
Empathize with them in the face of brutal market competition
The alienation and suffering experienced
Only then can we expand our minds.
This allows our theories to be grounded in reality.
That's all for today's video.
