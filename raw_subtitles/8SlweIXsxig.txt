Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 the
 [music]
 Book


Review
 Podcast.
 I'm
 MJ
 Franklin.
 I'm
 an


editor
 here
 at
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 Book


Review.
 And


the
 [music]
 year
 is
 just
 about
 done.
 The


holidays
 are
 upon
 us.
 The
 new
 year
 is
 on


the
 horizon.
 But
 before
 we
 flash
 to


2026,
 [music]


I
 wanted
 to
 take
 a
 break
 and
 ask,
 what


did
 2025
 mean
 for
 books?
 By
 that,
 I


don't
 mean
 what
 were
 the
 biggest
 [music]


and
 best
 books.
 If
 you
 want
 that,
 you


can
 go
 back
 and
 listen
 to
 our
 best
 books


of
 2025
 episode.
 [music]


What
 I
 want
 to
 do
 today
 is
 explore
 what


did
 2025
 hold
 for
 the
 book
 world
 big


picture.
 What
 was
 [music]
 the
 year
 like?


Were
 there
 any
 story
 lines
 that


dominated
 the
 conversation?
 Were
 there


trends
 [music]
 that
 emerged?
 I'm


wondering
 in
 10,
 20,
 50
 years
 from
 now


when
 we
 look
 back
 on
 2025
 in
 books,
 how


will
 we
 characterize
 this
 year?


Joining
 me
 to
 kind
 of
 step
 back
 and


debrief
 on
 this
 year
 are
 a
 series
 of
 my


wonderful
 colleagues.
 First,
 we
 have


Tina
 Jordan,
 a
 deputy
 editor
 here
 at
 The


Book
 Review.
 Hi,
 Tina.


>> Hi.


>> When
 I
 was
 thinking
 about
 this
 episode,


you
 were
 the
 first
 person
 that
 came
 to


mind
 because
 I
 feel
 like
 you
 just
 know


everything.
 You
 know
 every
 book
 that
 is


published.
 I
 feel
 like
 you
 know
 so
 much


industry
 news.


>> It's
 true.
 Ask
 anyone.


>> Well,
 now
 that
 John
 has
 joined
 us,


please.


>> Yes.
 And
 speaking
 of
 John,
 we
 have
 John


Maher,
 a
 new
 book
 news
 editor
 here
 at


the
 book
 review.
 Hi,
 John.


>> Hi,
 MJ.
 Tina,
 you
 still
 know
 more
 than


me.
 [laughter]


>> I'm
 not
 so
 sure
 about
 that.


>> This
 is
 a
 warm
 welcome
 for
 John.
 You've


been
 here
 for
 about
 a
 month
 at
 the
 book


review.


>> Two
 and
 a
 half.


>> Two
 and
 a
 half
 months.
 What
 is
 time?


>> I'm
 a
 toddler
 now.
 [laughter]


>> And
 one
 thing
 I'm
 going
 to
 blow
 up
 your


spot
 just
 a
 little
 bit,
 but
 one
 thing,
 a


favorite
 fact
 about
 John
 is
 John
 was


actually
 my
 first
 book
 friend
 in
 the


book
 world.
 We
 met
 in
 2015
 2016
 covering


the
 pen
 literary
 gala
 and
 I
 didn't
 know


anybody
 and
 I
 met
 John
 just
 also


covering
 it
 and
 we've
 just
 been
 friends


ever
 since.
 So
 I'm
 glad
 our
 paths


crossed
 again.
 Was
 that
 when
 I


introduced
 you
 to
 gay
 and
 nantles?


>> It
 is
 true
 and
 gay
 said
 to
 us
 you
 look


like
 you
 go
 to
 Vassor
 [laughter]
 and
 I


went
 to
 a
 smaller
 bar
 school
 so
 I
 was


like
 right
 yeah


>> me
 too.


>> Yeah.
 So
 John
 making
 book
 news
 happen


and
 also
 talking
 us
 through
 book
 news.


Thank
 you
 for
 joining
 us.
 Thrilled
 to
 be


here.
 And
 also
 with
 us
 is
 Alexandra


Alter.
 It's
 been
 a
 while
 since
 you've


been
 on
 the
 podcast.
 Welcome
 back.


>> Thank
 you.
 I'm
 so
 excited
 to
 be
 here.


>> Alexandra,
 as
 a
 books
 reporter
 for
 the


New
 York
 Times,
 you
 write
 profiles
 of


authors,
 features
 of
 literary
 trends,


breaking
 news
 about
 the
 publishing


industry,
 and
 more.
 So,
 also,
 you
 know


everything.


>> Not
 as
 much
 as
 Tina
 and
 John,
 but


[laughter]


together
 we
 might
 know
 almost
 everything


collectively.
 If
 we
 put
 all
 of
 our


collective
 together,
 we're
 close.


>> Our
 powers
 combined.
 So,
 I
 just
 wanted


to
 get
 together
 like
 the
 smartest
 book


people
 I
 know
 to
 just
 debrief
 and
 talk


about
 the
 year
 and
 books.
 And
 before
 we


dive
 in,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 do
 a
 vibe
 check.


How
 are
 you
 feeling
 about
 2025?
 I'll


start.
 I
 feel
 like
 the
 year
 was
 both


exhausting
 and
 meh.
 Not
 that
 there


weren't
 good
 books,
 but
 there
 was
 a
 the


energy
 seemed
 deflated
 this
 year.
 Maybe


that's
 just
 me,
 but
 that's
 how
 I
 felt


about
 the
 year.


>> No,
 I
 fully
 agree
 with
 you.
 It
 felt
 very


lackluster
 somehow.
 I
 disagree
 because
 I


spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 at
 romantasy
 book


signings
 this
 [laughter]
 year
 and
 you've


never
 seen
 more
 excited
 people
 than
 a


midnight
 release
 party
 for
 a
 big
 romanty


novel
 that
 people
 have
 been
 waiting
 for


for
 months.
 So
 I
 in
 these
 kind
 of


alternative
 sort
 of
 publishing
 spaces,


yes,
 I
 found
 a
 lot
 of
 excitement


happening.


>> Yes.
 Keep
 us
 honest.
 Keep
 us
 energized.


[laughter]
 Alexandra
 and
 romantasy.
 I
 I


do
 think
 we
 should
 come
 back
 to
 that


because
 I
 think
 sometimes
 what
 what
 the


publishing
 industry
 and
 the
 book


business
 feels
 like
 an
 eh
 year
 in
 terms


of
 just
 energy
 among
 those
 people
 is
 not


the
 same
 as
 the
 energy
 among
 the


readers.
 There
 were
 books
 that
 people


were
 very
 very
 excited
 to
 buy
 this
 year


regardless
 of
 whether
 or
 not
 we
 were


very
 excited
 by
 the
 books
 they
 were


excited
 to
 buy.
 You're
 totally
 right.
 we


say
 what's
 happening
 in
 the
 book
 world


but
 the
 book
 world
 is
 not
 a
 monolith


there
 are
 so
 many
 communities
 and
 genres


and
 I
 also
 think
 because
 of
 things
 like


social
 media
 increasingly
 so
 many
 silos


and
 book
 spaces
 and
 they
 all
 have


varying
 levels
 of
 energy
 and
 excitement


and
 all
 of
 that
 good
 stuff
 so
 that's


just
 our
 general
 table
 setting
 vibe


check
 it's
 a
 good
 year
 some
 of
 us
 feel


exhausted
 some
 of
 us
 feel
 energized


I
 want
 to
 go
 back
 and
 characterize
 big


picture,
 the
 year
 in
 books.
 And
 the
 way


I
 want
 to
 ask
 this
 is
 just
 for
 the
 sake


of
 having
 a
 neat
 tidy
 prompt,
 please


fill
 in
 the
 blank
 for
 me.
 2025
 was
 a


blank
 year
 in
 books
 or
 2025
 was
 the
 year


of
 blank.
 I
 guess
 I'll
 start
 by
 saying


for
 me,
 and
 we'll
 derail
 it
 immediately.


>> Yes,
 please.
 That's
 why
 I
 [laughter]


love
 open
 conversation.
 That's
 why


you're
 here.
 For
 me,
 2025
 was
 the
 last


year
 in
 books.
 Again,
 the
 energy
 felt


deflated.
 But
 one
 storyline
 that
 I
 was


following
 along
 was
 whether
 or
 not
 there


was
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 giant
 breakout


book
 of
 the
 year,
 and
 it
 didn't
 seem
 to


me
 like
 there
 was
 one.
 There
 were
 big


books
 for
 sure,
 commercial
 juggernauts,


things
 that
 stayed
 on
 the
 bestseller


list,
 and
 there
 were
 critically


acclaimed
 books,
 but
 the
 two
 did
 not


seem
 to
 meet
 to
 me.
 Is
 that
 accurate?


I'm
 thinking
 about
 previous
 years.
 There


were
 books
 like
 James
 and
 Martyr
 of


course
 last
 year
 but
 also
 Chain
 Gang


Allstars
 The
 Beasting
 Demon
 Copperhead


Trust
 Hamnet
 The
 Vanishing
 Half
 They're


There
 The
 Underground
 Railroad
 books


that
 seem
 to
 rise
 up
 and
 kind
 of


dominate
 the
 conversation
 and
 the


culture.
 And
 I
 didn't
 feel
 that
 this
 way


this
 year.
 But
 I
 think
 you're
 talking


about
 two
 different
 kinds
 of
 books


because
 when
 I
 think
 of
 an
 IT
 book,
 I


think
 of
 a
 grassroots
 word
 of
 mouth
 hit.


Okay.
 And
 we
 did
 have
 those
 this
 year


for
 sure.


>> James
 felt
 ordained
 in
 a
 way
 that


nothing
 this
 year
 did,
 which
 doesn't


mean
 it
 wasn't
 a
 year
 with
 big
 books,


right?


>> What
 were
 the
 books?


>> So,
 one
 of
 them
 is
 The
 Correspondent
 by


Virginia
 Evans.
 John
 knows
 more
 about


this
 book
 than
 I
 do,
 but
 I
 think
 it
 came


out
 last
 April
 or
 May.
 It
 was
 quiet.
 It


was
 from
 Crown.
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 even
 I


don't
 think
 it
 was
 pitched
 to
 me.


>> I
 didn't
 see
 it
 either.
 I
 just
 heard


that
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 love
 for
 it


coming
 from
 I
 mean
 it
 was
 grassroots.
 I


heard
 that
 Anne
 Patchet,
 the
 the
 author


and
 book
 seller
 loved
 loved
 loved
 this


book
 and
 that
 behind
 the
 scenes
 she
 kind


of
 helped
 bring
 it
 to
 a
 a
 big
 editor
 Amy


Einhorn
 who
 picked
 it
 up
 at
 Crown.
 But


Alexander,
 you
 talked
 to
 Amy,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 My
 understanding
 is
 that
 this
 was


a
 debut
 novel
 by
 an
 author
 who'd
 written


several
 books
 and
 never
 been
 able
 to


publish
 any
 of
 them.
 And
 it's
 an
 unusual


story.
 It's
 about
 a
 woman
 in
 her
 70s
 who


writes
 letters
 to
 famous
 people
 like


Joan
 Ddian.
 In
 fact,
 Anne
 Patchet
 is
 one


of the
 people
 she
 writes
 a
 [laughter]


letter
 to
 in
 the
 book.


>> I
 kind
 of
 love
 those.


>> I
 was
 lucky
 that
 Anne
 Patchet
 actually


liked
 the
 book.
 But
 yeah,
 it
 started
 off


kind
 of
 word
 of
 mouth
 and
 then
 I
 think


it
 really
 picked
 up
 amongst
 independent


book
 sellers
 who
 championed
 it
 and
 then


readers
 and
 it
 became
 just
 this


phenomenon
 and
 now
 it's
 sold
 hundreds
 of


thousands
 of
 copies
 which
 for
 a
 debut
 is


really
 astonishing.


>> So
 I
 stand
 corrected.
 There
 were
 big


books
 but
 for
 whatever
 reason
 I
 feel


like
 I've
 seen
 only
 certain
 spaces


talking
 about
 this.
 I
 haven't
 seen
 this


book.
 It
 has
 been
 like
 bubbling
 up
 word


of
 mouth.
 Maybe
 this
 is
 a
 2025
 it
 book


that
 will
 peak
 in
 2026.


>> Maybe.
 But
 maybe
 MJ,
 maybe
 we
 were
 a


little
 snobbish
 about
 this
 book
 to
 be


honest
 with
 you.
 Can
 I
 just
 say
 it's


commercial
 fiction?
 There's
 great


commercial
 fiction.
 We
 tend
 to
 wrinkle


our
 nose
 a
 little
 bit
 at
 that
 here.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 we've
 gotten
 better.


[laughter]


>> We're
 much
 better.
 We're
 much
 better.


But
 you
 know what
 I'm
 saying.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Well,
 when
 we're
 covering


things,
 we're
 talking
 about
 literary


conversations,
 literary.
 We're
 talking


about
 book
 awards
 and
 commercial
 fiction


often
 is
 overlooked
 in
 those
 spaces
 and


that's
 something
 something
 that
 we


always
 try
 to
 be
 mindful
 of
 but
 things


bubble
 up
 and
 slip
 through
 the
 cracks


and
 etc.


>> Right.
 But
 also
 correct
 me
 if
 I'm
 wrong


John
 and
 Alexander
 but
 I
 feel
 like
 these


word
 of
 mouth
 grassroots
 hits
 are
 just


so
 rare
 these
 days.


>> I
 think
 that's
 right
 to
 to
 MJ's
 point.


And
 I
 feel
 like
 there
 wasn't
 like
 every


conversation
 is
 happening
 around
 this


book
 this
 year,
 but
 in
 terms
 of
 breaking


out
 a
 debut
 or
 a
 lesserk
 known
 midlist,


mid-career
 author,
 it's
 gotten
 so
 hard.


I
 feel
 like
 people
 either
 have
 an


existing
 platform,
 they're
 celebrities,


or
 they're
 already
 best-selling
 authors.


I
 was
 thinking
 about
 who
 the
 bestselling


authors
 were
 this
 year
 and
 it's
 Freda


McFaten
 the
 housemaid
 still
 Rebecca


Yarao
 still
 these
 people
 who
 just


already
 have
 these
 audiences
 behind
 them


and
 so
 yeah
 I
 think
 getting
 a
 new
 author


out
 in
 front
 of
 people
 and
 getting
 book


sellers
 to
 care
 and
 readers
 to
 care
 is
 a


huge
 feat


>> one
 of
 the
 people
 that
 you
 mentioned


Rebecca
 Yaros
 built
 a
 grassroots


audience
 herself
 outside
 of
 the
 book


publishing
 industry
 first
 right


>> she
 did
 have
 an
 unusual
 path
 it's
 true


but
 once


>> it's
 less
 and
 less
 unusual
 Yeah,


>> Senu
 this
 year
 with
 Alchemized,
 a
 huge


book.
 This
 is
 a
 book
 that
 I
 would
 call
 a


grassroots
 hit.
 Why
 did
 a
 a
 literary


agent
 at
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 literary


agencies
 pick
 up
 this
 author?
 Because
 on


a
 fanfiction
 website,
 this
 Draco


Hermione
 fanfiction,
 Dram
 isn't
 a


hashtag.
 It
 probably
 is.


>> I
 think
 it
 is.
 It
 definitely
 is.


It
 had
 huge
 readership
 and
 you
 know
 that


that
 old
 dollar
 signs
 in
 the
 eyes
 in


like
 a
 looney
 tune.
 It
 it
 was
 there.
 But


so
 these
 are
 debuts.
 We're
 talking
 about


breaking
 out
 debuts.
 One
 of
 the
 things


and
 the
 reason
 why
 I
 call
 it
 the
 last


year,
 which
 is
 not
 to
 say
 that
 there


weren't
 good
 books
 or
 notable
 books,
 but


for
 me
 the
 year
 wasn't
 sticky.
 I
 feel


like
 there
 were
 a
 bunch
 of
 big
 books


that
 did
 come
 out
 that
 then
 you'd
 think


would
 stick
 around
 and
 dominate
 the


conversation
 but
 didn't
 for
 whatever


reason.
 So
 for
 instance,
 this
 is
 a
 book


that
 dominated
 a
 certain
 corner
 of
 the


conversation
 but
 like
 Catabasis
 by
 RF


Kong
 huge
 online
 huge
 on
 book
 talk.
 I


think
 it
 was
 so
 anticipated
 but
 I
 felt


like
 I
 saw
 that
 conversation
 happening


in
 our
 corner.
 We
 had
 a
 new
 Timandanda


Ngoadichi
 book
 that
 kind
 of
 bubbled
 up


and
 then
 fell
 off
 and
 people
 are
 still


reading
 it,
 but
 when
 I'm
 looking
 back


and
 thinking
 about
 what
 were
 the
 giant


books
 this
 year
 that
 maybe
 I'm
 being


pessimistic,
 Ocean
 Wrong
 was
 a
 giant


Oprah
 pick
 and
 then
 that
 bubbled
 up
 and


then
 kind
 of
 fell
 away.
 And
 that
 for
 me


is
 the
 story
 of
 2025.
 It's
 not
 that


things
 were
 bad
 if
 for
 whatever
 reason


things
 weren't
 sticky.
 And
 I
 guess
 the


last
 thing
 I'll
 say
 is
 I
 don't
 think


this
 is
 book
 specific.
 This
 is
 happening


in
 music.
 There
 was
 no
 song
 of
 the


summer.
 It
 is
 happening
 in
 movies
 where


people
 are
 talking
 about
 how
 the
 box


office
 is
 suffering.
 There's
 something


in
 the
 air.


>> But
 what's
 in
 the
 air
 is
 that
 so
 what


we're
 watching
 and
 reading
 and
 seeing


now?
 It's
 been
 in
 the
 works
 for
 how
 many


years?
 I
 feel
 like
 when
 all
 this
 stuff


was
 signed
 up,
 the
 mood
 was
 very


different.
 Right.


>> That's
 a
 good
 point.
 Yeah.
 And
 now


>> life
 cycle
 of
 a
 book
 it
 takes
 years.


>> And
 so
 now
 I
 think
 people
 I
 mean
 judging


by
 the
 success
 of
 books
 like
 the


correspondent
 they


>> they
 want
 cozy
 reading
 right
 they
 don't


want
 to
 be
 upset


>> and
 judging
 by
 their
 responses
 to
 our


best
 books
 of
 the
 year
 pick
 where
 they


were
 asking
 if
 we
 were
 okay.
 [laughter]


>> True.
 But
 I
 think
 that
 people


don't
 want
 to
 watch,
 read,
 see
 really


depressing
 things
 right
 now.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that's
 fair.
 It's
 hard
 to


blame
 them.
 And
 I
 also
 think
 that
 the


people
 who
 do
 find
 it,
 but
 I
 think
 we


are
 so
 far
 from
 anything
 vaguely


resembling
 a
 monoculture
 anymore
 that
 to


have
 a
 a
 book
 that
 was
 like
 the
 book
 of


the
 year.
 I
 mean,
 we
 talk
 about
 James.


Yeah.
 For
 us,
 James
 was
 the
 book
 of


2024.
 But
 I
 I
 really
 think
 that
 was
 the


book
 of
 the
 year
 because
 Perl
 Everett's


career
 was
 moving
 toward
 the
 moment


where
 it
 was
 time
 for
 him
 to
 be
 honored


by
 the
 literary
 world,
 by
 the
 publishing


world.
 That
 does
 not
 make
 it
 the
 book
 of


the
 year
 for
 readers.
 It
 makes
 it
 the


book
 of
 the
 year
 for
 the
 literati.
 And


that
 is
 not
 I
 don't
 even
 think
 we
 really


had
 one
 of
 those
 this
 year.
 We
 had


anticipated
 titles.
 We
 had
 titles
 we
 all


really
 liked.
 I
 think
 the
 gossip
 at
 the


desk
 about
 who
 was
 going
 to
 pick
 what


book
 for
 what
 best
 books
 list
 at
 what


outlet
 and
 why
 they
 picked
 that
 and
 oh


my
 god,
 how
 didn't
 we
 think
 of
 that?


There's
 just


>> are
 there
 too
 many
 books?
 This
 is


another
 [laughter]
 Oh
 my
 god,
 I
 love
 New


York
 Times
 book
 review
 news
 editor
 asks,


"Are
 there
 too
 many
 book?"
 [laughter]


>> New
 York
 Times
 book
 review
 news
 editor


asserts
 there
 are
 too
 many
 books.


[laughter]


But
 then
 also,
 I'm
 going
 to
 drop
 this


point
 cuz
 I
 love
 having
 like
 my
 own


perception
 like
 challenge,
 but
 there
 was


a
 new
 Emily
 Henry
 novel
 this
 year,


right?
 And
 that
 book
 was
 huge
 over
 the


summer
 in
 certain
 spaces,
 but
 nowhere


near
 the
 monocultural
 fervor
 that
 I
 feel


like
 I
 have
 felt
 for
 her
 previous
 books.


And
 that
 was
 interesting
 to
 me.
 I
 don't


know
 why,
 maybe
 it's
 just
 what
 I'm


looking
 at,
 but
 I
 feel
 like
 I'm
 on
 a


variety
 of
 spaces
 for
 books
 online.
 And


I
 do
 read
 a
 range
 of
 stuff
 from
 genre
 to


literary
 fiction.
 This
 conversation
 has


been
 big
 in
 the
 TV
 world
 and
 it's
 time


we
 had
 it
 in
 books.
 I
 think
 there
 hasn't


been
 I'm
 doing
 this
 in
 air
 quotes
 that


you
 can't
 see.
 There
 there
 hasn't
 been


since
 Game
 of
 Thrones
 a
 show
 that


everybody
 watched
 on
 Sunday.
 I
 think


this
 year
 kind
 of
 evidences
 that
 the


books
 world
 is
 in
 a
 similar
 place.
 So


that
 was
 my
 assumption
 about
 the
 year.
 I


called
 it
 the
 lost
 year.
 But
 I'm
 curious


what
 you
 all
 think.
 Should
 we
 go
 around?


I'm
 going
 to
 start
 with
 you
 first,
 John.


2025
 was
 the
 year
 of
 what?
 I
 also
 think


2025
 was
 a
 lost
 year,
 or
 at least
 I


think
 it
 was
 a
 year
 of
 losses.
 And
 I'm


sorry
 to
 be
 the
 Eeyore
 in
 this
 group,


but
 I
 do
 want
 to
 talk
 from
 the
 book


industry
 perspective
 just
 about
 what
 I


think
 this
 year
 has
 looked
 like
 for


publishers.
 And
 what
 I
 think
 this
 year


has
 looked
 like
 for
 publishers
 has
 been


grim.
 Inflation
 has
 made
 it
 a
 lot
 lot


more
 expensive
 to
 to
 make
 books.


Missiondriven
 nonprofit
 publishers
 lost


federal
 funding.
 That
 has
 made
 it


incredibly
 difficult
 for
 them
 to
 buy


books.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 to
 to
 buy


manuscripts,
 to
 publish
 books.
 And
 I


think
 it's
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 to


note
 that
 they
 are
 they
 are
 like
 the


grass
 of
 the
 publishing
 industry.
 They


are
 what
 keeps
 this
 ecosystem


nourished.
 And
 I
 think
 to
 see
 the


funding
 lost
 for
 nonprofits
 is
 we're


going
 to
 see
 that
 really
 in
 we're


they're
 feeling
 it
 now
 readers
 are
 going


to
 feel
 it
 in
 a
 few
 years.


>> I
 was
 going
 to
 ask
 so
 we
 follow
 the
 news


of
 funding
 losses
 but
 what
 can
 we


expect?
 Are
 we
 feeling
 it
 now?
 What
 are


we
 thinking?


>> I
 don't
 know
 about
 you,
 John,
 but
 my


feeling
 is
 that
 for
 years
 now,
 small


independent
 presses
 have
 been
 picking
 up


the
 balls
 where
 the
 big
 five
 publishing


houses
 have
 dropped
 them
 because
 the
 big


five
 are
 all
 about,
 you
 know,
 these
 one


book
 a
 year
 authors
 they
 get
 behind,


right,
 and
 spend
 all
 their
 money
 on.


They
 don't
 launch
 very
 many.


>> They
 don't
 have
 the
 publicity
 budget
 to


launch
 it.
 We're
 getting
 in
 the
 weeds.


So,
 let
 me
 try
 to
 unp
 [laughter]


untangle
 the
 big
 five
 publishers.
 It's


industry
 slang
 for
 the
 biggest


publishing
 houses.
 They
 are
 all
 at
 this


point
 large
 corporations.
 They
 are


conglomeratized.
 They
 operate
 like
 them.


They
 place
 more
 safe
 bets
 than
 unsafe


bets
 and
 they
 invest
 more
 in
 safe
 bets


than
 unsafe
 bets.
 That
 includes
 in
 the


literary
 side
 of
 things.
 I'm
 picking
 on


the
 wonderful
 P
 of
 Everett,
 but
 James,


the
 amount
 of
 money
 they
 put
 behind


James
 is
 not
 the
 same
 amount
 of
 money


for
 publicity
 to
 get
 attention
 for
 it


last
 year.
 It's
 not
 the
 same
 as
 they
 put


this
 year
 for,
 let's
 pick
 one
 of
 our


best
 books,
 The
 Director,


>> right?


>> A
 great
 book
 that
 absolutely
 was
 not
 a


book
 that
 anybody
 was
 gunning
 to
 be
 book


of
 the
 year,
 despite
 the
 fact
 that
 they


have
 a
 great
 team
 over
 at
 Summit.
 the


small
 publishers
 do
 work
 that
 they
 don't


have
 the
 money
 to
 blast
 everywhere
 to


get
 into
 media
 outlets
 that
 really


require
 somebody
 to
 be
 pestering
 and


pestering
 because
 I
 don't
 know
 about


y'all
 I
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 email
 and
 it
 you


need
 someone
 who
 is
 like
 on
 the
 clock
 to


help
 push
 stuff
 through
 and
 and
 get


through
 the
 noise


>> and
 to
 your
 point
 earlier
 John
 at
 Pcal


Everett
 his
 career
 took
 off
 with
 a
 small


press
 and
 he
 was
 basically
 supported
 by


them
 for
 years
 and
 got
 to
 do
 this
 really


interesting
 experimental
 work
 and
 then


when
 he
 had
 something
 more
 commercial


and
 he
 had
 kind
 of
 a
 legacy
 he
 got


picked
 up
 by
 one
 of
 the
 bigger


conglomerates.
 So
 these
 small
 presses


are
 really
 cultivating
 writers


discovering
 new
 talent
 they've
 become


this
 sort
 of
 feeding
 ground
 for
 the


bigger
 companies
 which
 will
 pick
 off
 the


prize
 winners
 or
 anyone
 who's
 standing


out
 critically.
 But
 if
 that
 pipeline


gets
 weakened
 or
 turned
 off,
 it
 will
 be


something
 that
 readers
 will
 notice.


>> That
 press
 you
 talk
 about
 in
 particular,


Greywolf
 Press,
 is
 a
 nonprofit
 and
 it


received
 federal
 funding
 from
 the


National
 Endowment
 for
 the
 Arts.
 Someone


want
 to
 fact
 check
 me
 on
 that?
 I
 am


99.9%
 sure.
 and
 they
 may
 have
 lost
 it


this
 year
 if
 that
 money
 was
 going
 toward


publishing
 programs
 that
 were
 not
 in


lock
 step
 with
 the
 Trump


administration's
 priorities,
 which
 is


what
 the
 letters
 said
 when
 the


publishers
 received
 them
 hearing
 we
 will


not
 give
 you
 these
 these
 funds.
 And
 I


think
 it's
 going
 to
 hurt
 literature
 down


the
 line.
 And
 it's
 not
 the
 only
 thing


that's
 happened
 this
 year
 that
 has
 made


that
 kind
 of
 impact.
 I'm
 going
 to
 quote


Wendy
 Williams,
 my
 fave,
 when
 I
 say,


"Hate
 to
 bring
 you
 down."
 [laughter]


Is
 there
 anything
 that
 we
 should
 be


thinking
 about,
 looking
 forward
 to
 to


kind
 of
 counter
 this
 though?
 I
 feel
 like


that
 was
 kind
 of
 a
 little
 bit
 scary
 and


bleak.
 What
 should
 we
 be
 doing
 or


thinking
 about
 or
 watching?
 That
 was


like
 my
 first
 bleak
 item.
 I
 had
 like


another
 [laughter]


>> No,
 I
 think
 I
 I
 I
 love
 MJ's
 thinking
 on


this
 and
 I
 have
 an
 answer.
 Publishing


stepped
 up.
 There
 were
 people
 in
 the


publishing
 business
 that
 really
 worked


very
 hard
 to
 counter
 this.
 The
 Melon


Foundation
 or
 outside
 the
 Melon


Foundation
 gave
 tons
 of
 money
 to
 poetry


this
 year.
 I
 think
 they
 gave
 like
 50


million.
 It's
 worth
 noting
 that


Elizabeth
 Alexander,
 who
 runs
 the
 Melon


Foundation,
 is
 a
 poet,
 but
 $50
 million


to
 poetry
 organizations
 is
 that's
 a
 lot


of
 money.
 They're
 not
 the
 only
 one.
 In


fact,
 a
 donor
 to
 I
 think
 it
 was
 Restless


Books.
 They
 have
 an
 immigrant
 writing


prize.
 One
 of
 the
 people
 on
 the
 board


funded
 that
 prize
 in
 order
 to
 make
 sure


that
 it
 didn't
 go
 under
 this
 year.


Alexandra
 and
 Liz
 Harris,
 our
 other
 book


business
 reporter,
 did
 some
 wonderful


reporting
 on
 bookstores,
 getting
 canned


goods
 to
 people
 who
 were
 food
 stamp


recipients
 during
 the
 government


shutdown.
 The
 book
 business
 stepped
 up.


They
 tried
 to
 do
 good
 work.
 They
 always


do.
 But
 you
 saw
 places
 where
 there
 was
 a


hole
 in
 the
 ground
 that
 they
 looked
 at


and
 said,
 "We
 have
 to
 fill
 this."
 I'm


glad
 we
 have
 a
 little
 uplift.
 [laughter]


A
 little
 uplift
 here.
 I
 was
 feeling
 bad,


but
 you're
 right.
 You're
 absolutely


right.
 What
 about
 you,
 Alexandra?
 2025


was
 what
 type
 of
 year?
 It
 was
 the
 year


of
 blank.


>> To
 me,
 it
 was
 really
 the
 year
 of
 fan


culture
 infiltrating
 mainstream


publishing
 just
 like
 it
 has
 in
 so
 many


areas
 of
 culture.
 But
 the
 arrival
 of


three
 Harry
 Potter
 fanfiction
 novels


transformed
 into
 romanty
 novels
 was,
 I


think,
 a
 stunning
 turn.
 And
 not
 just


because
 they
 started
 as
 fanfiction.


We've
 seen
 this
 before
 with
 big
 books


like
 Fifty
 Shades
 of
 Gray,
 started
 off


as
 Twilight
 fanfiction,
 but
 what
 was


different
 was
 that
 the
 publishers
 moved


really
 quickly
 to
 snap
 up
 these
 books


that
 had
 huge
 audiences
 online
 and


marketed
 them
 as
 Harry
 Potter


fanfiction,
 which
 is
 like
 getting
 you


into
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 copyright
 law


gray
 area,
 but
 without
 crossing
 any


lines.
 It
 just
 really
 embraced
 the
 fact


that
 these
 were
 works
 that
 evolved
 out


of
 that
 online
 culture


>> because
 the
 readers
 are
 embracing
 it,


right?
 This
 was
 after
 RLo,


>> Ali
 Hazelwood
 did
 Kylo
 Ren
 Ray


fanfiction
 from
 Star
 Wars
 and
 a
 lot
 of


other
 romance
 writers
 have
 come
 through


that


>> and
 that
 was
 a
 few
 years
 ago,
 but
 this


was
 the
 year
 of
 Harry
 Potter
 dramy.
 Can


you
 tell
 us
 what
 those
 books
 were?
 We


already
 talked
 about
 one
 of
 them,


Alchemize,
 which
 I
 think
 everyone


expected
 it
 to
 be
 big
 just
 because
 it


came
 with
 this
 existing
 audience.


>> It's
 like
 the
 biggest


>> debut
 of
 the
 year
 for
 sure.


>> But
 also
 in
 fanfiction
 spaces
 is
 like


one
 of
 the
 biggest,
 most
 read
 fan
 pieces


of
 fanfiction,
 period.


>> Yes,
 it
 was
 packaged
 as
 this
 kind
 of


blockbuster
 fantasy
 romance
 novel
 with


dark
 fantasy
 elements,
 which
 is
 what


everyone's
 super
 into
 right
 now.
 But
 to


see
 it
 really
 rise
 in
 print,
 I
 mean,


it's
 a
 long
 book.
 It's
 almost
 a
 thousand


pages
 long.
 People
 are
 devouring
 it
 and


it's
 sold
 more
 than
 700,000
 copies,


which
 is
 a
 huge
 number
 for


>> what,
 11,
 12
 weeks
 on
 the
 bestseller


list
 straight.


>> And
 so
 these
 are
 readers
 who
 have
 either


read
 it
 for
 free
 online
 already
 and
 many


of
 them
 just
 really
 wanted
 it
 in
 print


on
 their
 bookshelf
 or
 there
 are
 people


that
 heard
 about
 it
 on
 book
 talk.
 And
 so


to
 me,
 the
 story
 of
 2025
 was
 dramy.
 This


is
 vaguely
 depressing
 to
 me
 because
 this


is
 publishers
 just
 giving
 readers
 what


they
 know
 they
 want.


>> That's
 true.
 It's
 not
 discovery.
 It's


not
 discovery.
 It's
 not
 taking
 flyers
 on


new
 writers.


>> Remember
 the
 gatekeeper
 debate?
 Who
 won?


[laughter]


>> What's
 the
 gatekeeper
 debate?


>> Fans
 won.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of


argument
 on
 Twitter.
 Do
 you
 remember


that?
 Now
 known
 as
 X.


>> Now
 known
 as
 X.
 There
 were
 often


conversations
 about
 publishers
 are


gatekeepers.
 They
 are
 keeping
 types
 of


literature
 out.
 They
 are
 keeping
 types


of
 writers
 out.
 They're
 keeping
 writers


of
 color
 out.
 They're
 keeping
 queer


writers
 out.
 I
 think
 there
 has
 been
 an


obvious
 course
 correction
 in
 the


publishing
 industry
 and
 we've
 covered


it.
 But
 I
 also
 think
 that


in
 some
 ways
 publishers
 have
 almost


said,
 well,
 we
 know
 we're
 going
 to
 get


money
 if
 we
 give
 the
 people
 what
 they


want,
 so
 let's
 give
 the
 people
 what
 they


want
 and
 then
 we'll
 make
 money,


>> right?


>> And
 that
 sort
 of
 toddlogical


decision
 is
 in
 some
 ways
 a
 an
 abdication


of
 responsibility,


>> right?
 But
 now
 we
 go
 back
 to
 small


presses
 again
 because
 as
 the
 big
 presses


are
 doing
 this,
 this
 is
 where
 the
 indep.


>> This
 is
 a
 small
 press
 fan
 club.
 Now


>> it
 is
 indeed.


>> We
 have
 hats
 [laughter]


where
 we
 will.


>> I
 I
 was
 pleasantly
 surprised
 to
 see
 I


keep
 stats
 on
 everything
 the
 book
 review


does
 during
 the
 course
 of
 the
 year


>> because
 she
 knows
 everything.
 Exactly.


>> But
 we
 reviewed
 books
 by
 over
 130
 small


presses.
 That
 is
 amazing.


>> And
 that's
 like
 what
 a
 40th
 of
 how
 many


exist.
 There
 are
 so
 many
 and
 they
 do


such
 wonderful
 work
 and
 it
 is
 really
 go


to
 your
 public
 library
 as
 long
 as
 they


exist
 and
 ask
 your
 favorite
 librarian


what
 small
 presses
 they
 love.
 [music]


Watch
 them
 beam
 at
 you.
 So
 this
 is
 a


shout
 out.
 Yeah.
 You
 you
 have
 your


marching
 orders
 read
 small
 presses
 and


also
 go
 to
 your
 library.


>> Right.


We
 are
 going
 to
 continue
 with
 our


conversation,
 [music]
 but
 first
 I
 think


we
 should
 take
 a
 quick
 break.


And
 we're
 back.
 This
 is
 the
 Book
 Review


Podcast.
 I'm
 MJ
 Franklin.
 I'm
 talking
 to


my
 colleagues
 Tina
 Jordan,
 Alexander


Alter,
 and
 John
 Maher.
 And
 we're
 talking


about
 2025
 in
 books.
 Alexandra,
 you


mentioned
 it
 was
 the
 year
 of
 fanfiction,


but
 can
 you
 talk
 to
 me
 a
 little
 bit


about
 romantic


overall
 that
 was
 such
 a
 huge
 huge
 trend.


Are
 we
 still
 in
 a
 space
 where
 romantic


is
 king,
 queen,
 and
 dragon?
 What's


happening?
 What
 are
 the
 big
 trends
 in


publishing
 right
 now?
 What
 are
 the
 big


genres?
 Talk
 to
 me.


>> Such
 a
 great
 question.
 I
 think
 every


publisher
 is
 trying
 to
 figure
 that
 out


right
 now.
 Has
 this
 romanty
 craze
 been


saturated?
 Is
 it
 peaking?
 Rebecca
 Yaros,


the
 author
 of
 the
 Dragon
 Military


Academy
 romanty
 books,
 she
 sold
 more


than
 7
 million
 copies
 this
 year
 in
 just


print
 and
 digital,
 not
 counting
 audio,


and
 way
 above
 last
 year.
 So
 certainly
 on


her
 side,
 there's
 a
 huge
 appetite.


Authors
 like
 Sarah
 Moss,
 a
 huge


appetite.
 Some
 newcomers
 are
 breaking


out
 like
 Cali
 Hart.
 So
 there's
 still
 a


big
 chunk
 of
 people
 who
 want
 to
 read


these
 books.
 I
 think
 the
 question
 is,


have
 they
 now
 published
 and
 bought
 too


many
 of
 them?
 What's
 coming
 in
 the
 next


few
 years?
 Publishers
 have
 started
 to


talk
 about
 maybe
 the
 romantic
 starting


to
 fizzle
 and
 what
 people
 really
 love


right
 now.
 To
 my
 great
 surprise
 and
 bit


of
 alarm
 is
 dark
 romance,
 which
 is
 like


mafia
 romance,
 shadow
 daddies,
 who
 I


learned
 unfortunately
 are
 like
 bad
 guys


who
 are
 really
 terrible,
 but
 they
 love
 a


heroin,
 so
 that
 makes
 them
 kind
 of
 good.


What?
 Yes.
 So,
 so
 dark
 romance,
 this
 is


another
 thing
 that
 took
 off
 really
 in


fanfiction,
 a
 lot
 in
 self-publishing,


and
 once
 publishers
 noticed,
 okay,


people
 do
 want
 to
 read
 these
 things,
 a


lot
 of
 them
 are
 like
 quite
 taboo
 and
 get


into
 some
 morally
 gray
 areas,
 let's
 say.


>> Yeah,
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 it's
 from
 my


understanding,
 dark
 romance
 is
 a
 lot
 of


consent
 dubious.


>> Yes,
 there
 is
 that.
 or
 kidnappings
 and


things
 that
 I
 think
 publishers
 would


have
 been
 really
 nervous
 about


publishing
 a
 few
 years
 ago,
 but
 now
 that


there's
 a
 real
 market
 for
 it
 and
 they


can
 make
 money,
 you
 know,
 it's
 suddenly


we
 can
 take
 a
 risk
 on
 that.
 I
 think


they've
 seen
 things
 like
 Fifty
 Shades
 of


Gray,
 which
 no
 one
 had
 seen
 a
 book
 like


that
 at
 the
 front
 of
 Target
 and
 Barnes
 &


Noble
 before.
 So,
 they're
 always
 pushing


the
 envelope
 and
 romance
 is
 one
 of
 those


places
 where
 they
 do
 that.
 But,
 yeah,
 I


think
 I
 think
 that
 market
 is
 shifting


quite
 a
 bit.
 It's
 been
 a
 really
 tough


time
 for
 non-fiction,
 unless
 you're
 Mel


Robbins.
 [laughter]


Her
 Let
 Them
 Theory
 book
 has
 sold


millions
 of
 copies
 this
 year.
 It
 came


out
 last
 year,
 but
 it's
 still
 on
 the
 top


of
 the
 bestseller
 list.
 But
 I
 think
 when


it
 comes
 to
 other
 subjects,
 there's
 two


things
 happening.
 One
 is
 people
 are


really
 exhausted
 by
 the
 news
 and
 the


news
 cycle,
 and
 they
 just
 maybe
 don't


want
 to
 engage
 with
 anything
 too


serious.
 And
 there's
 also
 people
 turning


to
 like
 chat
 GBT
 or
 YouTube
 if
 they
 want


a
 recipe
 or
 they
 have
 a
 question
 or


they're
 planning
 a
 trip.
 It's
 like
 the


information
 ecosystem
 has
 kind
 of


morphed
 in
 a
 way
 that
 books
 aren't
 the


go-to
 place
 always
 for
 that
 kind
 of


>> interesting
 to
 me
 because
 we've
 talked


about
 chap
 GBT
 challenging
 publishers


challenging
 Google
 but
 I
 never
 thought


about
 how
 I
 might
 challenge
 long
 form


non-fiction
 and
 books


>> and
 particularly
 in
 those
 books
 or
 any


anything
 practical
 a
 travel
 guide
 a


field
 guide
 just
 things
 of
 that
 nature


where
 you
 used
 to
 want
 to
 have
 a
 solid


authority
 and
 now
 maybe
 the
 internet
 or


can
 provide
 an
 What
 you're
 saying
 is


Times
 Cooking
 needs
 to
 make
 an
 Andy


Baragani
 bot.


>> I
 mean,
 that's
 not
 a
 very
 good idea.


>> That
 will
 solve
 the
 problem.
 An


[laughter]
 Andy
 bot.


>> This
 is
 the
 start
 of
 our
 own
 IRL


dystopian
 novel.
 The
 bots
 have
 told
 us


to
 cook.
 Blah
 blah
 blah
 blah
 blah.
 And


now
 all
 of
 humanity
 is
 blah
 blah.


Anyway,
 I'm
 really
 glad
 you
 brought
 up


non-fiction
 because
 one
 of the


conversations
 that
 Tina
 and
 I
 have
 been


having
 over
 the
 past
 few
 weeks
 in


particular
 is
 that
 really,
 really
 meaty


non-fiction,
 non-fiction
 that
 tells
 a


story
 and
 gets
 deep
 into
 the
 thick
 of


why
 that
 story
 is
 worth
 telling
 is
 so


rewarding.
 And
 where
 is
 it?


>> Where
 is
 it?
 And
 that
 was
 what
 I
 was


going
 to
 say
 about
 this
 year
 for
 me
 was


that
 I
 there
 was
 just
 a
 dir
 of
 really


satisfying
 non-fiction.
 And
 there
 was
 a


piece
 of
 me
 we've
 you
 and
 I
 have
 had


this
 discussion,
 John,
 I
 wondered
 if


publishers
 were
 just
 wary
 to
 schedule


things
 for
 this
 year
 because
 they
 didn't


know
 what
 the
 mood
 in
 the
 country
 was


going
 to
 be
 after
 the
 election.


They
 were
 surprised.
 They're
 surprised


after
 every
 presidential
 election,
 it


seems,
 by
 what
 becomes
 popular.
 And
 so
 I


thought
 maybe
 they're
 holding
 things


back
 and
 yet
 we're
 looking
 at
 cataloges


and
 seeing
 things
 for
 next
 year
 and
 I'm


not
 seeing
 it
 for
 next
 year.


>> Can
 I
 pull
 this
 apart
 a
 little
 bit?
 I'm


curious
 what
 you
 mean
 by
 meaty


non-fiction.
 What
 are
 past
 examples?
 And


>> something
 like
 David
 Gran.


>> Okay.


>> I
 mean,
 there
 were
 some,
 don't
 get
 me


wrong.
 It's
 not
 that
 there
 was
 none
 of


this,
 but
 yeah,
 a
 book
 like
 a
 David
 Gran


book.


>> Do
 you
 think
 it's
 that
 is
 it
 the


meatiness
 that
 we
 were
 missing?
 That
 was


a
 long
 book.
 And
 I
 feel
 like
 one
 book
 we


talked
 a
 lot
 about,
 it
 was
 one
 of
 our
 10


best
 was
 a
 marriage
 at
 sea,
 for


instance.


>> Very
 thorough,
 very
 in-depth,
 but
 slim.


Right.


>> Right.
 Where
 were
 the
 rest
 of
 the


marriage
 at
 seas?
 Because
 usually
 there


would
 have
 been
 any
 number
 of
 books
 that


of
 narrative
 non-fiction,
 especially


>> with
 shre
 in
 particular.


>> With
 shre
 in
 particular.
 Yes.
 But
 there


are
 usually
 a
 lot
 of
 those.
 There's
 so


many
 skilled
 writers
 who
 do
 those
 so


well
 and
 yet
 I
 just
 felt
 like
 we
 didn't


really
 see
 them.


>> So
 for
 you
 then,
 what
 did
 that
 do
 to
 the


year
 overall?


>> It
 was
 interesting.
 I
 kept
 reading


further
 and
 looking
 and
 casting
 more


widely
 and
 thinking
 that
 I
 was
 missing


things
 and
 asking
 people
 on
 the
 desk,


should
 I
 read
 this,
 should
 I
 read
 that?


But
 I
 felt
 like
 John,
 I
 felt
 like
 you


and
 I
 and
 other
 people
 on
 the
 desk
 sort


of
 all
 feel
 the
 same
 way.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I've
 heard
 this
 from
 editors,


too.
 I've
 heard
 from
 editors
 that


>> the
 market
 isn't
 there,
 that
 they
 feel


like
 their
 international
 colleagues


don't
 want
 to
 buy
 it
 and
 and
 they
 feel


like
 the
 readership
 isn't
 really
 there.


I
 mean,
 the
 number
 of
 times
 that
 I
 have


heard
 non-fiction
 editors
 say,
 "Serious


non-fiction
 isn't
 selling,
 even
 the
 ones


who
 came
 up
 to
 me
 in
 London
 Bookf
 Fair


earlier
 this
 year
 and
 said,
 "Don't


believe
 the
 hype.
 It's
 going
 to
 sell."


When
 I
 talked
 to
 them
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


summer
 or
 before
 the
 Frankfurt
 Bookf


Fair
 in
 fall,
 the
 two
 big
 book
 fairs
 of


the
 year,
 they
 were
 like,
 I
 think
 they


were
 right
 about
 it
 not
 selling.
 Some
 of


it
 is
 a
 mystery
 even
 to
 the
 publishers.


The
 human
 mind
 is
 a
 mystery.
 why
 we


choose
 what
 we
 choose.
 We
 can
 try
 to
 be


anthropological
 about
 it
 as
 much
 as
 we


can,
 but
 sometimes
 it's
 just
 it
 is
 or


isn't
 in
 the
 water,
 but
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


it
 is
 just
 like
 people
 are
 wiped
 out.


They're
 wiped
 out.
 And
 it
 is
 a
 serious


investment
 to
 think
 about
 complex


history,
 whether
 it's
 narrative
 or
 not,


complex
 journalism,
 whether
 it's


narrative
 or
 not.
 the
 non-fiction
 that


has
 sold
 this
 year,
 a
 lot
 of
 the


non-fiction
 that
 has
 sold
 this
 year


really
 well
 has
 been


>> self-help.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 because
 people
 want


to
 be
 told,
 "Yes,
 that's
 it.
 You're


doing
 it."
 Rather
 than
 here
 are
 some


people
 who
 didn't
 do
 it
 really
 really


[laughter]
 bloodily
 and
 it's
 I
 don't


know,
 maybe
 it's
 just
 too
 much
 right


now.


>> Alexandra,
 you
 just
 chimed
 in
 and
 said,


"Yep.
 What
 are
 you
 noticing?
 What
 are


you
 thinking?"
 Well,
 interestingly,
 we


already
 talked
 about
 the
 let,
 you
 know,


the
 let
 them
 theory
 and
 why
 that's
 such


a
 hit,
 but
 I
 just
 talked
 to
 someone
 at


Book
 Scan
 who
 was
 telling
 me
 that


religious
 titles
 are
 up
 quite


significantly.
 Sales
 of
 the
 Bible
 are
 up


quite
 a
 lot
 and
 anything
 in
 the
 kind
 of


self-help
 genre.
 That's
 where
 they're


seeing
 the
 strength
 in
 non-fiction.
 So,


I
 think
 people
 want
 to
 be
 told
 that


they're
 going
 to
 be
 okay.
 So


>> I
 want
 to
 be
 told
 that
 and
 coloring


books
 are
 back.
 Coloring
 books
 are
 back.


Yes.
 People
 want
 to
 either
 be
 coloring


or
 to
 be
 told
 that
 they
 will
 be
 okay


>> because
 adult
 coloring
 of
 books
 that
 was


like
 a
 giant
 trend
 in
 what
 2016
 and
 then


kind
 of
 fell
 away


>> also
 in
 the
 1960s.
 I
 mean
 it's
 a
 trend


like
 every
 20
 years.


>> Interesting.


>> Yeah.
 What
 does
 it
 say
 about
 this
 moment


that
 people
 want?


>> Is
 there
 a
 geopolitical
 crisis
 every


[laughter]


>> I
 don't
 know.
 But
 I
 remember
 once


finding
 an
 article
 in
 the
 Times
 archives


about
 adult
 coloring
 books
 in
 the
 1960s


and
 the
 big
 seller
 [laughter]
 was
 like


the
 John
 Burch
 Society.


>> Readers
 contain
 multitude.


>> Yeah,
 [laughter]
 I
 guess
 so.
 One


interesting
 exception
 and
 I
 have
 to
 say


the
 strength
 of
 the
 sales
 really


surprised
 me
 is
 Kamla
 Harris's
 memoir


107
 days.
 It
 has
 sold,
 I
 think,
 more


than
 600,000
 copies,
 which
 at
 a
 moment


when
 people
 probably
 don't
 want
 to
 think


too
 much
 about
 last
 year's
 election,
 and


political
 books
 are
 a
 really
 tricky
 era


right
 now,
 there
 seems
 to
 just
 be
 a
 ton


of
 interest
 in
 this
 book.


>> Her
 book
 tour,


>> she
 added
 another
 leg
 of
 her
 book
 tour


for
 next
 year.


>> 18
 dates.


>> Yes.


>> What?
 I
 can't
 I
 don't
 understand
 this


either.
 Nobody
 under
 I
 feel
 like
 this
 is


a
 absolutely
 baffling
 to
 me
 in
 in
 part


because
 it's
 like
 it's
 such
 a
 specific


memoir.


>> And
 maybe
 that's
 part
 of
 why
 it
 did
 work


that
 there's
 still
 this
 like
 we
 want
 to


know
 what
 was
 going
 on
 in
 her
 head,
 what


was
 going
 on
 in
 their
 heads.
 Maybe


that's
 it.


>> The
 thing
 about
 this
 memoir,
 too,
 is


there's
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 news
 in
 it.
 We
 know


almost
 everything
 in
 it.
 So,
 what


propelled
 these
 sales?
 I
 haven't
 had
 a


chance
 to
 read
 it
 because
 I
 am
 often


limited
 in
 my
 reading
 by
 what
 I'm


writing
 about
 like
 that
 week
 and
 so


things
 get
 pushed
 back,
 but
 people
 say


it's
 kind
 of
 a
 page
 turner
 because
 you


do
 get
 to
 see
 the
 minute-by-minute


decisions
 and
 their
 impact.
 And
 I
 think


the
 fact
 that
 Geraldine
 Brooks
 worked


with
 her
 on
 it,


>> normally
 you
 would
 maybe
 not
 even
 credit


your
 ghost
 writer
 or
 keep
 it
 a
 secret,


but
 certainly
 getting
 someone
 who's
 a


novelist
 and
 a
 real
 writer


>> and
 a
 real
 writer
 and
 a
 journalist
 who


can
 craft
 a
 narrative
 like
 that,
 I
 think


that
 made
 a
 difference.


>> So
 maybe
 it's
 not
 people
 are
 coming
 to


it
 for
 specifically
 the
 news,
 but


they're
 coming
 to
 it
 for
 a
 yarn,


>> right?


>> Yeah.
 Keep
 in
 mind
 what
 most
 politician


memoirs,
 even
 big
 bestselling
 ones,
 are


like.


>> No.
 no
 disclosures
 whatsoever.
 Yeah.


>> Or
 [laughter]
 even
 if
 they're


disclosures
 and
 or
 even
 if
 they
 wrote
 it


themselves,
 it


>> they're
 not
 usually
 beautifully
 written.


>> Let
 me
 just
 put
 it
 that
 way.


>> So
 that's
 our
 sense
 of
 the
 year.


Overall,
 for
 me,
 I
 was
 like,
 it
 was
 the


lost
 year.
 But
 though
 I've
 been


corrected,
 John,
 it
 was
 the
 year
 of


losses,
 though
 there
 are
 ways
 to
 combat


them.
 Alexandra,
 it
 was
 the
 year
 of


fanfiction
 and
 romantic.
 Tina,
 it
 was


the
 year
 of
 wavering
 non-fiction,


>> right?


Now,
 I'm
 just
 curious.
 I
 want
 to
 pan
 out


a
 little
 bit
 more
 and
 ask,
 what
 were


other
 big
 storylines
 or
 news
 events
 that


you
 think
 about
 when
 you
 think
 about


2025
 in
 general,
 specifically
 in
 books?


It's
 Tina's
 turn
 to
 start.


>> Oh,
 no.
 Well,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 it
 might


be
 the
 Mr.
 Beast,
 James
 Patterson


book
 collaboration
 deal.
 I
 could
 not


believe
 how
 popular.


>> Can
 you
 tell
 us
 more?
 What
 was
 this?


>> Well,
 they're
 work
 they're
 doing
 a
 book


together.
 Like
 I'm
 unclear
 about
 how
 the


James
 Patterson
 books
 honestly
 really


come
 together,
 but
 you
 know
 he


collaborates
 with
 all
 kinds
 of
 famous


people,
 a
 lot
 of
 Hollywood
 folks.


>> Did
 this
 deal
 feel
 different
 than
 other


types
 of
 big
 celebrity
 writer
 collabor


[clears throat]


I
 don't
 know
 why
 it's
 like
 it
 was
 so


buzzy.
 Everyone
 was
 talking
 about
 it
 and


they
 were
 talking
 about
 it
 for
 three


months.
 Go
 figure.
 This
 is
 interesting.


It
 kind
 of
 goes
 back
 to
 what
 we
 were


discussing
 about
 publishers
 looking
 at


what's
 happening
 in
 culture
 and
 wanting


a
 piece
 of
 it.
 And
 in
 this
 case,
 this


was
 James
 Patterson,
 who
 I
 think
 is
 an


incredible
 business
 person
 is
 super


smart
 about
 knowing
 where
 the
 market's


going,
 getting
 his
 hand
 into
 every


single
 genre
 you
 can
 think
 of.
 He's
 done


books
 with
 Dolly
 Parton,
 with
 Bill


Clinton.
 And
 so,
 I
 think
 he
 thought


maybe
 he
 needed
 some
 younger
 readers.


I'm
 making
 a
 sort
 of
 assumption
 here,


but
 obviously
 Mr.
 Beast
 is
 a
 huge


YouTube
 star
 and
 getting
 any
 of
 his
 fan


base
 over
 into
 the
 James
 Patterson


ecosystem.
 He
 has
 his
 young
 adult
 books


or
 they're
 actually
 middle
 grade
 and
 he


has
 huge
 readership
 there,
 but
 I
 think


there
 was
 maybe
 a
 little
 gap
 in
 the


middle
 with
 20somes
 or
 teens
 and
 I
 mean


this
 was
 the
 first
 one
 of
 the
 first


things
 that
 I've
 written
 about
 where
 my


kids
 were
 like,
 "Oh,
 you're
 going to
 get


to
 interview
 Mr.
 Beast."
 I
 was
 like,


"Oh,
 [laughter]


but
 they
 were
 actually
 interested
 in


that."
 So
 they
 didn't
 know
 who
 James


Patterson
 was.


>> This
 entire
 novel
 concept
 feels
 like
 a


mad
 lib.
 And
 that's
 how
 I
 felt
 when
 I


was
 hearing
 about
 it
 at
 the
 London
 Bookf


Fair
 when
 it
 was
 the
 book
 that
 everybody


was
 talking
 about.
 The
 Biden
 memoir,
 by


the
 way,
 was
 also
 on
 sale
 at
 the
 London


Bookf
 Fair.
 And
 the
 Mr.
 Beast,
 James


Patterson
 book
 was
 the
 one
 that
 people


were
 talking
 about.
 And
 I
 just
 I
 again,


it
 feels
 like
 a
 Mad
 Lib
 gone
 off
 the


rails
 to
 me.


>> Okay,
 so
 that's
 one
 news
 event.
 James


Patterson,
 Mr.
 Beast,
 what
 about
 you,


Alexander?
 Is
 there
 something
 a
 news


event
 a
 storyline
 that
 really
 stands
 out


to
 you
 when
 you
 think
 about
 the
 year


that
 we
 haven't
 mentioned
 so
 far?


>> I
 actually
 thought
 it
 was
 an
 interesting


year
 for
 postumous
 releases.
 We
 had
 Joan


Ddian's
 therapy
 notes
 which
 were


>> fascinating
 but
 also
 a
 really
 strange


publication
 for
 somebody
 who
 cured
 her


public
 image
 so
 carefully.
 I
 think
 there


was
 a
 lot
 of
 debate
 about
 whether
 she


would
 have
 wanted
 these
 diaries


published.


>> Tell
 me
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 about
 Yeah.


what
 that
 publication
 was.
 What
 was


strange
 about
 it?
 What
 is
 this
 book?
 She


left
 these
 diaries
 behind
 so
 clearly.
 I


think
 her
 publisher
 and
 agent
 felt
 like,


well,
 if
 she
 had
 any
 objections
 to
 these


being
 published,
 she
 knew
 what
 she
 was


doing.
 She
 wouldn't
 have
 left
 them
 in
 a


filing
 cabinet
 like
 this.
 But
 she
 had
 no


explicit
 instructions
 about
 whether
 or


not
 she
 wanted
 to
 publish
 them.
 And


they're
 very
 personal,
 particularly


about
 her
 daughter
 Quintana,
 who
 who


died
 tragically
 and
 from
 a
 medical


condition.
 But
 Diddian
 had
 always
 been,


even
 in
 her
 most
 personal
 memoirs,
 so


protective
 of
 Quintana
 and
 not
 talked


about
 her
 alcohol
 issues.
 And
 so
 to
 see


some
 of
 that
 behind
 the
 scenes,
 what
 she


was
 really
 thinking,
 it
 gives
 you
 real


insight
 into
 her
 published
 writing
 and


her
 memoirs.
 But
 I
 think
 it
 also
 made


some
 people
 in
 her
 inner
 circle
 a
 little


uncomfortable.
 So
 it
 was
 just
 I
 thought


it
 was
 a
 fascinating
 example
 of
 like


where
 do
 we
 draw
 the
 line
 withostumous


publications
 and
 how
 much
 privacy
 does


is
 an
 author
 owed
 particularly
 when
 she


didn't
 say
 don't
 publish
 these


>> Alexandra
 you
 mentioned
 posumous
 books


plural
 what
 were
 other


>> yes
 I
 was
 also
 thinking
 of
 the
 Harper


Lee
 collection
 of
 stories
 which
 to
 me


that
 was
 interesting
 just
 because
 as


everyone
 knows
 late
 in
 her
 career
 a
 sort


of
 prequel
 which
 was
 kind
 of
 a
 sequel
 to


Tequilla
 Mockingbird
 came
 out
 and
 there


was
 a
 lot
 debate
 at
 the
 time
 over
 what


her
 intentions
 were
 with
 that
 book.


She'd
 had
 it
 sitting
 around
 for
 decades.


Why
 is
 it
 coming
 out
 now
 when
 she's
 we


haven't
 heard
 from
 her
 for
 so
 long,


people
 thought
 she
 might
 have
 been


pressured
 to
 publish
 it.
 So,
 anything


new
 by
 a
 writer
 of
 her
 stature,
 when


we'd
 had
 that
 conversation
 previously


about
 what
 she
 wanted
 published
 or
 not,


this
 was
 not
 anywhere
 near
 as
 fraud
 of
 a


conversation,
 but
 it
 was
 interesting
 to


see
 more
 from
 her.
 And
 yeah,
 just
 back


to
 the,
 you
 know,
 when
 these
 books
 come


out,
 it
 always,
 I
 think,
 raises


interesting
 questions
 about
 a
 writer's


legacy
 and
 do
 we
 want
 to
 see
 every
 last


scrap
 that
 they
 wrote
 and
 how
 does
 that


impact
 our
 thinking?


>> John,
 you're
 up.
 What's
 your
 other
 news


event
 notable
 thing
 from
 the
 year?


>> MJ,
 you're
 never
 going to
 have
 me
 back


because
 I
 am
 just
 so
 depressing.


[laughter]


>> Oh
 god,
 where
 are
 you
 taking
 us?


>> It's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 that
 bad.
 I


actually
 think
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 fun


to
 talk
 about,
 but
 it's
 actually
 about


and
 not
 to
 naval
 gays,
 but
 books
 media.


This
 year
 was
 a
 year
 of
 just
 it
 was
 like


a
 hard
 year
 for
 books
 media.
 And
 I
 want


to
 pin
 it
 to
 two
 things.
 I
 want
 to
 pin


it
 to
 the
 summer
 reading
 list
 created
 by


AI
 with
 fake
 books
 that
 was
 published
 in


the
 Chicago
 sometimes.
 And
 maybe
 one


other
 paper.


>> It
 was
 syndicated.


>> It
 was
 syndicated.
 So
 there
 was
 a
 list


of
 books
 that
 were
 not
 books
 by
 authors


who
 are
 authors
 that
 was
 published
 as
 I


believe
 a
 promotion
 in
 multiple
 papers


because
 it
 was
 syndicated
 and
 it
 was
 all


slop
 and
 that
 was
 exceedingly


embarrassing
 for
 everybody
 involved


including
 authors
 who
 were
 like
 why
 is


my
 name
 being
 attached
 to
 this
 thing
 I


didn't
 do
 and
 what
 do
 you
 mean
 it's
 in


the
 Chicago
 Sun
 Times?
 So
 there's
 that.


And
 I
 think
 that
 was
 dismaying
 and
 in
 a


sort
 of
 absurdist
 way,
 but
 dismaying
 in


a
 sort
 of
 existentialist
 way
 was
 the
 AP


deciding
 that
 they
 were
 no
 longer
 going


to
 run
 book
 reviews
 that
 were
 syndicated


by
 many,
 many,
 many
 papers
 that
 cannot


afford
 their
 own
 books,
 critics.


>> And
 I
 think


>> this
 is
 an
 indication
 of
 a
 downturn
 that


I
 think
 we've
 all
 known
 has
 been
 coming


in
 certain
 places
 for
 some
 time.
 We
 all


know
 that
 the
 media
 has
 struggles
 and


the
 book
 publishing
 business
 has
 its


struggles,
 but
 th
 this
 year
 those
 two


things,
 they
 weren't
 backtoback
 exactly.


I
 can't
 say
 it
 was
 June
 and
 then
 July,


but
 to
 me
 it
 felt
 like
 a
 one-two
 punch


and
 I
 was
 holding
 like
 ice
 to
 my
 jaw
 a


little
 after
 that.


>> I
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 any
 of
 you
 felt
 the


same
 way.


>> I
 think
 the
 shift
 in
 the
 way
 people


discover
 books
 has
 been
 so
 extreme


recently.
 It's
 gone
 from
 good
 readads
 to


book
 talk
 to
 Amazon
 reviews
 and
 yeah


that
 was
 a
 depressing
 turn
 but
 it's


something
 we
 struggle
 with
 here.
 We
 are


a
 book
 review.
 We've
 been
 a
 book
 review


for
 over
 125
 years.
 If
 people
 aren't


reading
 reviews
 to
 figure
 out
 what


they're
 going
 to
 read
 next,


>> what
 are
 they
 doing?
 Right?
 Like
 how
 do


we
 where
 do
 we
 meet
 them?


>> Yeah.
 where
 like
 what
 are
 they
 reading


and
 how
 can
 we
 give
 it
 to
 them
 so
 that


they
 don't
 go
 to
 chat
 GPT
 and
 ask
 chat


GPT
 to
 generate
 [laughter]


a
 a
 cookbook
 and
 best
 books
 list.
 I
 am


going
 to
 try
 to
 be
 positive
 and
 turn


this
 car
 around.
 But
 I
 feel
 like
 that


challenge
 though
 is
 something
 that
 we've


been
 talking
 a
 lot
 about
 here
 at
 the


times
 and
 it's
 inspired
 a
 lot
 of


innovation.
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 have
 these


types
 of
 chatty
 podcast
 that
 we
 have
 a


book
 club.
 We've
 been
 doing
 really


incredible
 service
 lists
 and
 find
 your


next
 book
 guides
 and
 quizzes
 to
 find


books
 where
 we're
 engaging
 with
 readers.


Oh,
 I
 think
 it's
 been
 great.
 And
 I
 think


we
 at
 the
 times
 in
 the
 books
 department


are
 are
 thoughtfully
 trying
 a
 lot
 of


things
 and
 experimenting
 and
 in
 a
 way


it's
 kind
 of
 an
 exciting
 time
 because
 we


can
 just
 dream
 up.


>> Yeah.


>> What
 we
 want
 to
 try.


>> So
 that's
 our
 Yeah.
 2025.


>> Oh
 man,


>> what
 a
 year.


>> So
 long.
 Such
 a
 [laughter]
 long
 year.


>> Are
 we
 there
 yet?
 Are
 we
 there
 yet?
 Just


about.
 Just
 about.
 I
 guess
 my
 last


question
 before
 we
 go.
 I'm
 putting


everyone
 on
 the
 spot.
 Tell
 me
 one
 good


thing.
 [laughter]
 Tell
 me
 one
 good


thing.


>> I'm
 sorry
 you
 had
 to
 do
 this,
 MJ.
 I
 know


it's
 all
 my
 fault.
 [laughter]


>> This
 could
 be
 a
 book
 that
 you
 love
 that


you
 just
 want
 to
 shout
 out.
 Something


that
 bubbled
 up
 and
 you're
 like,
 "Yes,
 I


loved
 this."
 An
 online
 conversation.


Something
 that
 just
 delighted
 you.
 Tell


me
 something
 good.
 Two
 of
 my
 favorite


authors
 lease
 books
 that
 they
 had
 spent


20
 years
 either
 working
 on
 or
 trying
 to


get
 published.
 Karen
 Desai's
 the


loneliness
 of
 Sonia
 and
 Sunonny.
 I
 got


to
 interview
 her
 about
 the
 book
 and
 it


was
 just
 here's
 somebody
 who
 did
 nothing


else
 for
 the
 last
 two
 decades
 but
 create


this
 incredible
 story
 and
 I
 just
 found


that
 so
 inspiring
 that
 there
 are
 still


people
 who
 are
 willing
 to
 do
 that.
 And


then
 Helen
 Dwit,
 uh,
 the
 author
 of
 The


Last
 Samurai,
 came
 out
 with
 a
 book
 that


she
 wrote
 about
 20
 years
 ago
 and
 has


been
 trying
 to
 get
 published
 for
 that


long.
 And
 it
 was
 extraordinary
 to
 see


that
 project
 finally
 arrive.


>> Love
 that.
 What
 about
 you,
 John?


>> I
 confess
 that
 I
 am
 the
 somewhat
 much


maligned
 kind
 of
 very
 online
 white
 male


reader
 who
 loves
 Lashlo
 Prashna
 Horai.


Oh
 my
 god.
 [laughter]


>> And
 I
 am
 so
 here
 for
 you


>> to
 see
 my
 man,
 [laughter]


my
 personal
 friend.
 I
 wish
 call
 me,
 call


us,
 please.
 We'd
 love
 an
 interview.


[laughter]
 Win


win
 the
 Nobel
 Prize
 in
 literature.
 I


rewatched
 Vermeister
 Harmony's,
 the


wonderful
 bailar
 adaptation
 of
 the


melancholy
 of
 resistance,
 or
 a
 portion


of
 it
 afterward.
 It's
 amazing.
 You


should
 all
 watch
 it
 if
 you
 haven't.
 the


shot
 and
 tango
 which
 in
 English
 we
 would


probably
 call
 Satan
 tango.


>> We
 talked
 about
 this
 on
 an
 episode.
 We


did
 a
 books
 book
 awards
 debrief
 and


whether
 it's
 shot
 and
 tango
 satan
 tango.


How
 you
 say
 that?
 It
 was
 a
 big
 point
 of


conversation.


>> That
 film
 is
 9
 hours
 or
 something
 like


seven
 hours.
 I
 wouldn't
 recommend
 that.


The
 other
 one
 is
 like
 two
 and a
 half.
 Do


that.
 What
 about
 you?
 One
 good
 thing


Tina.


>> One
 good
 thing.
 Okay.
 As
 a
 as
 an


unabashed
 genre
 fan,
 I
 really
 loved
 the


spread
 and
 popularity
 of
 what
 I'm
 going


to
 call
 cozy
 genre
 fiction.
 And
 I'm
 not


just
 talking
 like
 cozy
 romance,
 but
 cozy


mysteries.
 There's
 cozy
 horror.
 Did
 you


know
 there
 was
 such
 a
 thing?
 There's


cozy
 fantasy.
 And
 I
 do
 think
 it
 speaks


to
 what
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 earlier


that
 people,
 they
 just
 want
 to
 read


something
 that's
 going
 to
 make
 them


happy.
 They
 just
 want
 to
 read
 something


that's
 not
 going
 to
 distress
 them,


right?
 But
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 really
 good


and
 I
 was
 thrilled
 to
 see
 it.


>> Can
 you
 give
 us
 some
 Rex?


>> I
 will
 throw
 one
 in
 here
 for
 you,
 Tina.


This
 is
 a
 cozy
 horror.
 It's
 a
 comic


book.
 It's
 called
 Beneath
 the
 Trees


Where
 Nobody
 Sees.
 And
 it
 was
 a
 breakout


hit
 from,
 I
 believe,
 last
 year.
 and
 it


won
 not
 the
 Eisner
 but
 the
 other
 big


comics
 prize
 this
 year
 at
 New
 York


Comic-Con
 which
 they're
 going
 to
 hate
 me


for
 forgetting
 the
 name
 of
 the
 prize
 on


this
 podcast
 [laughter]


but
 I
 read
 it
 on
 the
 way
 back
 from
 New


York
 ComicCon
 after
 it
 won


>> let
 me
 give
 you
 the
 big
 mainstream


example
 and
 that's
 the
 Richard
 Osman


Thursday
 Murder
 Club
 books
 are
 100%
 cozy


mysteries
 there's
 nothing
 that's
 going


to
 make
 you
 blanch


>> Tina
 I'll
 tell
 you
 my
 favorite
 cozy
 cat


fantasy.
 It
 was
 called
 I
 Will
 Prescribe


You
 a
 Cat
 about
 a
 pharmacy
 in
 Tokyo


where
 if
 you're
 sick,
 you
 go
 and
 they


prescribe
 you
 a
 cat.
 And
 there's
 a


sequel
 called
 I
 will
 prescribe
 you


another
 cat.
 [laughter]


>> I'm
 so
 there.


So
 there.


>> It's
 better
 than
 the
 comic
 with
 the


murderous
 teddy
 [laughter]
 bear.
 I
 think


unfortunately
 we're
 running
 out
 of
 time.


So
 I
 think
 we
 should
 wrap
 up.
 But
 I
 just


want
 to
 say
 a
 huge
 huge
 thank
 you
 Tina


Alexandra
 John.
 This
 was
 so
 fun.
 The


year
 was
 a
 rough
 year,
 but
 this


conversation
 great,
 uplifting,
 and
 I


feel


>> it
 was
 fun.
 Thank
 you
 for
 having
 us.


[music]


>> And
 thank
 you
 for
 our
 listeners,
 for


joining
 us
 in
 this
 adventure,
 for


listening
 with
 us
 all
 this
 year.
 We
 will


be
 back
 next
 week
 with
 our
 book
 club.


We're
 reading
 [music]
 What
 We
 Can
 Know


by
 Ian
 Mchuan.
 We
 hope
 you'll
 join
 us.


But
 until
 next
 time,
 happy
 reading.
