I am Steve Stoute, author of the book, "The
Tanning of America," founder
of UnitedMasters,
as well as creative solutions
company, Translation.
So when we talk about building a company,
most companies
have core missions and values
that the CEO or the founder has that's
going to be the DNA of the company. It leads
to how you — the kind of people you hire,
your expectations,
your ambition.
It's the things that's most important that
if you don't have those ingredients,
if those aren't the framework in which the
company operates in,
then you're going to attract the wrong
talent, and you're going to lose sort of your North
Star — what you're trying to obtain. And I
think that that is the CEO's
responsibility.
How you go about coming up with these
values: out of all the things that you feel are
important, what are the top five, six — I
would say no more than seven things —
that you need every employee to fully
understand and embrace,
and use that as the guiding principles
on how you operate. And everyone has that
shared understanding.
I'll start with our first one, which is
getting on the plane.
What do I mean by getting on
the plane?
When I first started building the
business, there was this opportunity where you
could, like, call somebody
and, like,
pitch them the idea or try to move them
from point a to point b.
And for me, I thought it was very
important and that people respected
and appreciated
the idea that you will actually get on the
plane to come see them to have that
dialogue,
even if it was 15 minutes, a half
hour. And I know that seems extreme to many,
but I can't tell you how much of a
difference maker it's been in my career, the fact
that I was able and I prioritize
physical presence
in order to show you: a. how much I cared
about what I was saying,
and how much I cared about the importance
of
us connecting
in a real way. And that effort,
it may have helped ideas that weren't
as great
go further
because,
it led to a dialogue that turned into
something else. And in most times, it
helped an idea that was already good
be prioritized over another idea that
could have been as good that came from
somebody else because I actually did
the work
to get on the plane. That is one of the
values that I learned early on as a
difference maker as I was building
the company.
Conflict is critical to success.
You show me an organization
that seamlessly gets through conflict
in a positive way, and I'll show you a
winning team. Accepting that there's going to be
conflict
and running towards that conflict
as part of the values of the company,
for me, I think is important. Because in
my organization, I don't want people to
think that I think that conflict
is something that's
a bad thing
or
an aspect
of poor performance.
I want people to know conflict
comes
when two people who are high performing
have the same goal, but see it going at it
two different ways with the right intent:
perfection,
success,
ambition, growth. In an organization, you
want conflict
because you want to hear two, three, four,
five different perspectives
on why
that marketing plan will succeed or
fail, or why the product
color should be that color versus that
color, or why we should name it this, or what
the priorities are
that's going to lead to the most success,
or
there's four candidates. Which one should
we hire? If you put the company at the
center
and you remove yourself, and what's the
best idea for the company,
regardless of
the fact that you guys may disagree?
It allows you to think through, I can
challenge this person
as long as I am not disrespecting them
while I challenge them. So
framing conflict
as something that could be positive
towards a better outcome for the company
when you walk in the door as a leader,
to me, is important. Conflict is not a
bad word.
How you deal with conflict can make it a
bad word.
Being fearless helped me
tremendously throughout my career. The
first thing you can do is lead by example. If
you want a team of people to be fearless,
obviously, you as a leader have to be
fearless, and they have to see
what fearless leadership looks like. So
when I go throughout my career,
you take it back to starting a
beauty company
with Carol's Daughter, a beauty company
that, you know, we ended up building and
selling to L'Oreal at one point. I
didn't know anything about the beauty
business. But what I did know is there was
a problem there that I could solve.
And the fearless part was being able to
say, "I can go into
this area
and solve a problem
even though I don't understand
all of the elements of the beauty business
itself." That's for me what fearless has
been for me in business. Like, not being
afraid of the failure that seems
imminent because you don't know the
industry itself. Not being afraid
of what you don't know, but knowing that
you're willing to go into it with a big,
open heart and a wealth of
acceptance
of what you don't know,
and all of that stuff coming together
would lead to a better — would lead to a
great outcome. Know what you don't know.
Embrace what you don't know.
Find joy.
Find freedom
in saying, "I don't know." And then learning
what you don't know
will develop
the muscle memory you need
to take that fearlessness and turn it into
something. I can't just say being
fearless at everything
is the right answer.
But in chasing your dreams and chasing
your ambition,
it certainly is critical.
