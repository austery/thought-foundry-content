The next time you take
an international trip, do me a favor.
Take a look at your passport.
On the cover, there’s your
country’s coat of arms.
And then you open it, 
and there’s your photograph.
The best one you've ever taken, right?
On that page, there's two lines
at the bottom.
Letters and numbers.
That's called the machine-readable zone.
Those two lines are magic.
The product of international cooperation.
Because without them,
you wouldn't be able to get on that plane.
You wouldn't be able to cross immigration.
You wouldn't be able
to travel the world, see your family.
Now what I find fascinating
is that those two lines
came about in 1980,
when the International
Civil Aviation Organization
set about standardizing passports.
At the beginning, only three countries
adopted the standard.
Today, just about every single country
has that standard.
This is international
cooperation at its best.
And it doesn't stop there.
Some people will watch this talk
on the internet,
or at least I hope they will.
Well, did you know that, 160 years ago,
20 countries came together
to lay the foundations
of our global telecommunications networks?
They founded something called
the International Telegraph Union,
or the ITU.
It's still active today,
although it's moved on from the telegraph.
Even in times of conflict,
global cooperation continues.
In the midst of the war in the Ukraine,
representatives from the United States,
China, Europe, Asia, Africa,
Latin America and Russia
were sitting in the same room at the ITU,
continuing to negotiate
things like internet protocols
or global digital governance.
Did you know that time zones exist
because of a multilateral agreement,
or that green means "go"
because of a multilateral agreement?
Our lives are made better
when countries collaborate.
It is the infrastructure
of the modern world,
and we can't live without it.
But today ...
we're facing a crisis of trust.
Trust in the international system.
I see this every day, because I work
with international organizations
and their leaders,
trying to make them more effective.
And I'll be the first to admit
that talking about multilateralism
and effectiveness in the same sentence
sounds a bit complicated.
Many think about these organizations
and they see a mesh of red tape,
or they see endless bureaucracy
or political posturing.
They wonder, is there any tangible impact?
It's making people lose faith
in international organizations.
I get it.
In our constantly changing world,
is it any surprise that the institutions
crafted around the geopolitical realities
of the end of the Second World War,
80 years ago,
that those organizations
are struggling to keep up?
It's making us ask, is international
cooperation even worth it?
Well, I'm here to persuade you
that it absolutely is.
I implore you, take another look.
And I give you fair warning
that staying in the arena
and giving multilateralism another go
means one thing for sure.
We cannot continue with business as usual.
It is time to rethink, to reevaluate,
to recalibrate how we collaborate
on a global scale.
And in my humble opinion,
this starts with rebuilding trust.
How?
Allow me to offer
something rather provocative.
We must stop insisting
on inviting everybody to the meeting.
Sounds a bit hard,
I know, but hear me out.
Imagine trying to get your slide deck
together, or your project budget,
or your memo written
with 200 of your most well-meaning
colleagues working with you on it.
Sounds pretty difficult, right?
Which is why trying to negotiate anything
with 193 countries at the outset
and trying to achieve
global consensus on that issue
will deliver one thing
for certain, if anything at all.
And that is the least
objectionable outcome.
But to rebuild trust ...
and take on the most
difficult challenges of our time,
we cannot settle for the least
objectionable outcome.
We need the most ambitious,
the bold, the transformative outcomes.
So let's take an alternative
and augmented path forward,
one that is rooted
in the art of diplomacy,
one that has served us for over a century,
but one which we seem to have lost.
Let's unleash coalitions of the willing
to show what 21st-century
multilateralism and cooperation
can and should look like.
I define coalitions of the willing
as small, dynamic groups
of like-minded, and sometimes
not so like-minded, actors,
coming together.
They can be some combination of countries
from the South and the North,
the East and the West.
Civil society organizations,
academic institutions,
religious organizations.
And -- and this
is important -- businesses.
They come together with shared purpose
to solve a problem larger than themselves,
a problem that requires
genuine collaboration
and cocreation to solve,
problems that require a committed group
to act first and to act boldly.
The coalition takes on the risk,
it serves itself up as the guinea pig.
It proves the model.
It makes it easy for others to join in,
and it pushes the snowball
down the mountain.
This is how we've done
diplomacy for decades.
We've just forgotten.
I love this example from the 1950s,
when banks started issuing credit cards.
There was one problem.
Some cards were small,
some cards were large.
Some were made of paper, some of plastic.
There was no interoperability.
So a few of them came together --
American Express, Diners Club
and a few others.
They came together and they adopted
a uniform standard for a credit card.
So what you have
in your wallet today is standard.
It has your name and a number on the front
and a metallic strip on the back.
And then, they worked
with countries to enshrine this
in the International
Standards Organization.
So today, when you go to a restaurant
and you tap your card,
or you go to an ATM machine
and you take out some cash,
if people still do that ...
you trust that it's going to work.
But you don’t attribute that
to multilateralism or to the ISO
or to a coalition of the willing.
But that's how it started.
Imagine we had to renegotiate,
or start afresh negotiating,
what a standard credit card
looks like today.
What would that look like?
Insisting on inviting everybody
to the meeting?
Well, it would be --
and the idea would be put to a committee.
The committee would run consultations,
endless consultations
with hundreds of actors --
those that are super-relevant
and those that are less relevant.
Then, it would craft a convention
or a resolution or a compact,
and put that forward
for 193 countries to negotiate.
There would be co-facilitators
appointed to run this process.
Their objective would be to reach
global consensus among 193 countries.
And the result?
The least objectionable outcome.
Which is why today, we need to start
with coalitions of the willing
to make things work
ambitiously for the future.
I would be so energized
to see the United Nations
or other multilateral organizations
invite coalitions of the willing
to take on some of our most
difficult challenges --
AI governance, migration, food security.
It's not happening at the rate
we want it to happen,
but it is actually happening,
and I have a lot of hope.
One example that gives me
a lot of hope is the LEAF Coalition,
the Lowering Emissions
by Accelerating Forest Finance Coalition.
It started with a handful
of countries that were donors,
a handful of countries that had forests,
a handful of corporations
and a handful of civil-society
organizations.
They all came together
and they sat at a table, a small table ...
and they tried to figure out,
what do we do about deforestation?
How do we protect biodiversity?
And so they didn't wait for 200 countries
to negotiate the last clause of a treaty.
They acted.
They put billions of dollars on the line,
and they created a new market
for protecting nature.
And now everyone is rushing in
to join that coalition.
This is what 21st century multilateralism
and international cooperation
can and should be.
And so we have a choice.
Should we stay together
and take this new path forward,
or should we walk away?
I hope we stay together.
Thank you.
