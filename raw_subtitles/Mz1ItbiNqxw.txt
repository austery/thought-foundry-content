Picture Earth's icy places.
Mountain glaciers, Siberian permafrost,
the poles.
This is the cryosphere,
the frozen part of the world.
Now picture your fridge.
It's a white box,
maybe stainless steel,
maybe messy, maybe pristine,
maybe full, maybe empty.
Regardless, it is just the tip
of the iceberg.
Because if you live
in the developed world,
your fridge is connected
to an entire network of thermal control.
It's called the cold chain,
and it brings nearly three quarters
of everything you eat
from the farm to your table.
It's also massive.
Add all those refrigerated warehouses,
shipping containers, trucks,
supermarket cabinets together,
and this artificial cryosphere
is more than 700 million cubic meters.
It's a new Arctic.
And unlike the real one, it's growing fast
as people all around the world
get their first fridge
and join the cold chain themselves.
A little more than a decade ago,
I realized that even though
I'd been writing about,
thinking about food for years,
I had never set foot
inside this vast artificial cryosphere
we'd built for our food to live in.
So I put on my thermal underwear
and set out to explore.
And what I discovered
is that refrigeration
isn't really about cold.
It's about freshness.
But also, once you have a fridge,
every food problem seems
like it can be solved by cold.
Take the avocado.
The avocado is a tropical fruit.
It has a short shelf life,
and it is beloved in all kinds of places
where an avocado tree would never grow.
The avocado can only
travel thousands of miles
and remain fresh and delicious,
rather than shriveled and rotten,
because of refrigeration.
Once it's harvested,
an avocado, like a human,
only has a certain number of breaths
it can take before it dies.
If you chill it, it breathes more slowly
and so it lives longer.
Yes, fruit and vegetables have better
anti-aging tech than we do.
Right now, if you go
to a supermarket in Amsterdam,
the avocados on the shelf
are likely from Kenya.
Kenyan production of avocados
quadrupled between 2010 and 2020.
The quantity of avocado
eaten by Dutch people
quadrupled during roughly
the same time span.
The two are not unrelated.
What's also related,
avocados, with other fruits and vegetables
and together with cut flowers,
are now Kenya's largest source
of overseas revenue.
They've overtaken coffee,
tea, even tourism.
But the majority of that export produce
comes from just a few large farms,
several of which are owned
by multinational corporations
because they are the ones
that have the resources to install
and maintain expensive
refrigeration equipment.
Meanwhile, the avocado is thirsty.
It requires irrigation to grow in Kenya,
and Kenya is currently in water crisis.
But perhaps you'd rather think
about or eat a fresh marula fruit.
Well, if you're not in sub-Saharan Africa
in the summer, good luck to you.
People say it tastes like a combination
of pineapple, mango, lychee and guava,
which sounds amazing.
I would like to try one myself very much,
but the marula fruit doesn't show up
in US supermarkets.
It doesn’t refrigerate well,
and so it can't be a commodity
the way an avocado can.
This is another consequence
of refrigeration.
Yes, the cold chain means that those of us
that are connected to it
can eat fresh produce all year round,
but only those fruits and vegetables
that can be refrigerated.
So these are just a couple of examples.
There are similar stories to be told
about all perishable foods
all over the globe,
but I hope you're starting to see
something that should be obvious,
but hasn't really been part
of the conversation until now,
which is that refrigeration has costs
as well as benefits.
We implemented mechanical
refrigeration in the late 1800s
to solve two very specific problems:
how to make lager beer in the US in summer
and -- for real --
(Laughter)
And how to get meat to people
living in the world's
first truly big cities.
It has solved those problems
and then some.
In countries with a US-style cold chain,
people can now eat meat and tropical fruit
in quantities that would
have been previously unimaginable,
even for royalty,
and at prices that mean
that almost anyone can have a burger,
a Bud and a banana
every single day of the year.
This is miraculous, but it has trade offs.
And the biggest trade off of all
is that cooling the artificial cryosphere
is melting the natural one.
The chemicals and energy
used to refrigerate food
already account for between 2.5
and three percent of all global emissions.
That's just cooling food,
not buildings or server farms
or any of the other things we keep cool.
That's the same as, maybe even
a little more, than global aviation.
And like I said,
the cold chain is growing fast.
Developing countries want
a cold chain for good reasons,
because it will help them make money
exporting crops like avocados,
and because it will help them
reduce food waste.
That's true, but only partially.
Refrigeration is really effective
at reducing waste
between the farm and the market.
Before the US had a cold chain,
30 percent of everything it grew
rotted before it made it to market.
Today, those losses
have shrunk almost to nothing.
But guess what?
Now Americans throw away
30 percent of everything
that makes it to market.
Refrigeration moved
where the waste takes place.
It didn't eliminate it.
And as for exports,
that's a game you only win
by competing on price,
which means scale,
which means a few large firms
owned by multinationals.
Meanwhile, you've drained your aquifers
and replaced your marula trees
with avocado plantations.
Reducing food waste
and lifting smallholders out of poverty
are important goals.
Building a US-style cold chain
might not be the best way to achieve them.
What's more, if we build a US-style
cold chain for everyone alive today,
the emissions from refrigeration
will multiply by five,
at which point they'll be the same
size as the entire US emissions.
In other words, unimaginably huge.
OK, so that's the doom-and-gloom part.
This is a crisis,
but it's also an opportunity
because most of that cold chain
hasn't been built yet.
This is the moment to rethink
our relationship with refrigeration.
And just like developing countries
skipped landlines and checkbooks
in favor of cell phones
and digital banking,
they can do better when it comes
to food preservation.
And then we in [developed]
countries can learn from them
to remake our own food systems.
What might this look like?
Well, for one, we can change
how we refrigerate.
One example.
If you disturb the molecules,
the atoms in particular
types of materials,
they will suck in heat energy
from their surroundings
to reorganize themselves.
Bingo! You've created a fridge.
Scientists have a super cool --
pun intended -- prototype.
It works by squeezing and releasing
a cheap and common form of plastic,
and it produces the same amount of cooling
for less than half the emissions
of an old-school fridge.
So changing how we refrigerate
can reduce emissions.
It is a solution.
It is not the solution.
Ultimately, we have to think
about our goals.
We want our beer cold,
but for most food,
the real goal is freshness.
So what if we could achieve
freshness without cold?
Good news, already you can buy fruit
that has been sprayed
with an edible fat-based powder
that forms a nanoscale coating
that keeps produce fresh
at room temperature
for nearly as long as the fridge
keeps it in the cold.
So imagine a smallholder farmer in Africa
being able to preserve their harvest
using a spray bottle
rather than a power-hungry fridge.
There’s also a new process
in commercial development
that uses supercritical carbon dioxide
to keep meat good at room temperature
for six months-plus.
Or if you say, well,
refrigeration compressed geography
by expanding perishable
foods' travel time,
well, why not speed up travel?
Right now, America's largest grocery
is delivering unrefrigerated
chicken and ice cream
by drone, in Arkansas,
taking refrigerated trucks off the street
and refrigerated supermarket
shelves out of the equation.
Even in the kitchen, people are working
to liberate food from the fridge.
Many fruits and vegetables
actually taste better,
have more nutrients,
and last longer in slightly warmer,
more humid conditions.
So why not shrink our fridges
and redesign our homes to allow that?
Just to be clear, I am not anti-fridge.
I love my fridge.
Refrigeration has
an important role to play
in any future food system.
But let's approach it
a bit more like we do cars.
These days we know we can electrify them
and we can remove them
from our city centers
and we can replace them
in some situations,
replace them altogether with bikes
and better public transit.
And these can be better ways
to achieve both our mobility goals
and our sustainability
and quality of life goals.
So let's think like that
about preserving freshness,
using refrigeration only
when it's the right solution,
while also redesigning our fridges
to make them more sustainable.
And maybe we can save the planet,
fix our food system
and make life more delicious.
Thank you.
