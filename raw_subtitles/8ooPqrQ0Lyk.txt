Jennifer Pagliaro is the
Toronto Star's crime reporter
and has been following this
story closely. And she joins me
in studio. How are you doing?
>> Good. Thanks so much for
having me.
>> There is a lot to uncover
here. We are learning a bit
more about the officers and the
civilians involved. Give us the
latest.
>> So we just reported that
some of the officers were
involved in a little bit more
detailed allegations from the
police that they, one of them
was involved with a civilian
who's also charged as part of
this project, helping advise
her on how to install a GPS
tracker on another woman's car.
It allegedly damaged her car,
and that woman also felt
harassed when she was followed
using this tracker. And
ultimately, police say she
feared for her safety. Now, a
Toronto police officer is
charged jointly with a civilian
in that allegation, which is, I
think, shocking to a lot of
people.
>> And I'm. Correct me if I'm
wrong. Was there a gun also
found as well?
>> Yes. The civilian had a very
old model gun that she was
allegedly keeping in a unlocked
drawer inside of an envelope in
her residence, which she was
charged with carelessly storing.
We're not sure how she got the
gun. If the officer
participated in helping her in
any way. He's not charged with
that, but of course, concerning
nonetheless.
>> And there was another
officer, something closely
related to insurance fraud or
something with a car. What do
we know?
>> Yeah, there's an officer who
allegedly counselled one of his
associates on how he could help
have that car stolen so that
that person could claim an
illegal insurance fraud on the
stolen car, which would have
been a setup, essentially. We
know that the person whose name
is on that court record, that
name is also known to us as
being one of the Peel Region
police officers who is
suspended but not criminally
charged. No one would confirm
that they're the same person.
But of course, that name has
popped up now on the court
record, and that person
allegedly never went through
with the stealing insurance
fraud scheme. And so that's why
that person's not criminally
charged. But the officer
involved, Sergeant Robert Black,
is charged with counselling him
on how to commit insurance
fraud.
>> All right. We were making
the comment that it feels like
this is an onion just being,
you know, we're peeling and
seeing the layers. There's a
lot to it. I want to take a
step back just to kind of make
sure we have all of the details
here at the moment. How many
officers have been charged and
with what if you can give us
sort of some of the more
extreme charges versus some of
the lesser ones?
>> Yeah. So seven active duty
Toronto police officers were
charged, as well as one retired
police officer. The interesting
bit there is he and his son are
co-accused in this case. His
son only has around four years
on the force and they're
charged with a host of things.
Some of the more serious
charges is the officers are
actually charged themselves in
trafficking drugs, not just in
aiding in that criminal
activity, as well as accepting
bribes and searching police
databases, essentially leaking
personal information that's on
these confidential databases to
known alleged criminals who
were then disseminating it. And
we know that has led to a
series of crimes, including
conspiracy to commit a murder
against a Toronto jail official
and also a shooting various
homes through the GTA.
>> Fair to say the conspiracy
to commit murder. The most
serious charge on that list.
>> It is.
>> All right. The now we do.
You had mentioned Peel police
as well. Three officers who
have been suspended, not
criminally charged. Do we know
anything on that if that's
going to turn into anything?
>> Yeah. Well, we got a bit of
a clue recently with that name
that we saw that may have been
involved in the insurance fraud.
We don't know too much about
what these other officers are
alleged to have done, or
whether they're just under
suspicion at this time and have
been suspended pending
investigation. We just know
that they don't have criminal
charges, and we're not sure if
they will warrant criminal
charges, but we're watching
that very closely.
>> In terms of the precincts,
throw out some numbers.
Obviously, for a lot of
reviewers, they probably won't
know where they are, but just a
general description of where
where they are.
>> Yeah. So most of these
officers, the active officers
were assigned to divisions in
sort of the northwest part of
the city. So in the Black Creek
North York areas, there was one
officer assigned to a down like
a right downtown core division.
We know that some of the
officers were working at the
same divisions, 12 division
that's in that Black Creek area.
So we're still piecing together
how all of the officers may
have known one another or came
to know one another. In the
past, for example, we've been
able to figure out that some of
the officers who have all been
sort of 19 years of service
between them, may have
graduated from police college
together. And they also worked
at 12 Division together early
in their careers. So perhaps
those relationships were
maintained. We're still trying
to understand what those
allegations are and what the
conspiracy is on at a big
picture level.
>> All right. I want to talk
about one constable whose name
really surfaced in the
beginning, Constable Tim
Barnhart. Who is he? What have
we learning more of?
>> Yeah. So he's one of those
12 division officers. He's been
on the force for 19 years. He's
been a constable that whole
time, which means typically at
a division you're like a rogue
cop. You go out to nine, 11
calls or anything that requires
your attention. He is one of
those officers who is himself
charged with trafficking in
drugs. He is an officer who we
know is alleged to have leaked
the address of the jail
official, who then these
alleged criminals tried to kill.
Okay. And we also know that he
is involved in other alleged
conspiracies, such as trying to
protect illegal pot shops in
the city. We know cannabis was
legalized. There are still
issues with illegal marijuana,
and so there's a whole host of
allegations of obstructing
justice, falsely accusing
people trafficking in drugs, as
I said, and that involvement in
the eventual conspiracy to
commit murder.
>> Now, I know at the press
conference when Toronto police
unveiled the investigation,
there were questions posed to
Project South ties to the tow
truck wars that have been in
the headlines for quite a while
in GTA. What do we know? Is
there is there a stronger
connection there? What do we
know about that?
>> Yeah, we were sort of
surprised when the press
conference happened. My
colleague Abby O'Brien was
there, and she's been covering
this tow truck issue a lot, and
we Recognized one of the names
of the civilians. That person
was previously arrested for the
incidents. I mentioned shooting
up various houses in the GTA,
including in Vaughan. One of
those houses allegedly belongs
to a so-called kingpin in this
tow truck industry, which, you
know, your viewers may have
seen, as you mentioned, that
there's been a lot of
infighting to the extent of,
you know, calling it a war.
Shootings back and forth
repeatedly in these locations,
home addresses, tow truck yards.
It's been really problematic.
>> One has to ask. And this was
a question that was asked at
that press conference as well.
But have any criminal cases
been compromised because of the
probe into police corruption?
>> We've been actively
searching that out. We've been
talking to criminal defence
lawyers to find that out. So
far, I haven't heard of any
cases falling apart, but I
think it's still a little bit
early days for that. And that
is obviously a huge concern.
>> All right. We mentioned
Ontario's Inspectorate of
Policing is launching a review
into all police departments
across Ontario. Does that mean
the problem goes beyond just a
few bad apples? Obviously this
case here is really tied into
the GTA for the most part.
But does this problem go beyond
that?
>> Yeah, I think it's a valid
question. I'm personally really
curious to see what the
inspector general finds. I
don't think we have any
allegations beyond this Toronto
Police Department. And, you
know, those three Peel officers
who have not been criminally
charged. However, there are
some bigger questions about
supervision, the way police
have access to sensitive
information and just overall,
their ability to be
incentivised to work with this,
these criminal entities. And I
think it's worth exploring. Of
course, I'll be very interested
to know how deeply they go on
the Toronto police force and
whether they uncover any more
systemic issues with that force.
>> Let's talk reaction.
Political leaders, of course,
have been quick to jump on sort
of their thoughts on here,
police unions as well. How are
they reacting so far?
>> Well, there were some
questions about whether Toronto
Police Chief Myron Demkiw was
going to face questions of
leadership so far, talking to
people behind the scenes. I'm
not seeing any strong calls or
any calls at all, really, from
the mayor's office, from the
police board that oversees the
force or from the union, who
often has a lot of negative
things to say about policing
management. So I think for now,
Demkiw is not taking the fall
for this. He seems to be taking
it relatively seriously. But of
course, the investigation as we
know, is not over. So we're
just waiting to see how that
plays out politically.
>> You mentioned Chief Demkiw.
Obviously this is a big hit to
public trust. And so I am
curious, what are members of
the public saying? You know, it
wasn't that long ago when there
were calls for defunding the
police. We are talking we are
in the midst of budgets. So,
you know, these are usually
pretty high up there when we
talk about the money allocated
to salaries for police. But
what are the public saying?
>> Yeah, I think like we've
seen such a huge shift in
attitudes toward policing over
the last decade and especially
over the last five years. And I
think it this investigation, I
think, for a lot of people,
validates what they felt was
already happening in terms of
corrupt policing. Now, I don't
think anyone really knew
specifically that this was
going on or could have
predicted this. I certainly
didn't, but I think it's
reinforcing a lot of negative
opinions about policing. And
that's a huge mountain for
Demkiw and the service as a
whole to overcome. And they
have a lot of work to do to
already repair a fractured
trust in policing.
>> You have been on the crime
beat for a bit here. I got
to ask, has there been anything
like this in Toronto police
history or in just in the
stories that you have covered
in general? We are just at the
beginning here. Yeah. Have you
seen anything like this?
>> No, I honestly couldn't have
imagined anything like this.
You know, the night that we
were starting to hear the
initial rumours and then were
able to confirm seven officers
accused as part of a massive
York police investigation. It's
just never happened. It's
unprecedented. We're in
unchartered territory, and
we're still waiting to see how
far this goes. I asked chief
Demkiw if he expected more
arrests of his members, and he
said he didn't want to speculate
on what the investigation would
bring. So we're tuning in to
see what happens next.
>> All right. As will we.
Jennifer, thank you very much.
Really appreciate your time.
>> Thank you so much for having
me.
