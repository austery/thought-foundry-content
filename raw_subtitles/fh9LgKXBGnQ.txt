Hi,
 I'm
 Offer
 from
 Victara.
 At
 Victara,


we
 developed
 a
 trustworthy
 agent


operating
 system.
 And
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


really
 cool
 use
 cases
 with
 this
 like


document
 generation,
 conversational
 AI


or
 chat
 bots,
 either
 internal
 or


external,
 and
 enterprise
 deep
 research,


which
 I'm
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 today.
 But


before
 I
 jump
 into
 Enterprise
 Deep


Research,
 let
 me
 tell
 you
 a
 little
 bit


more
 about
 our
 operating
 system
 for


agents.
 First
 of
 all,
 it's
 a
 SAS


platform,
 but
 also
 runs
 on
 your
 own
 VPC


or
 on
 premise
 in
 your
 own
 data
 center.


And
 here's
 some
 of
 the
 main
 features


that
 we
 really
 are
 proud
 of.
 We
 have


very
 advanced
 multimodal
 injust
 to


support
 images,
 tables
 in
 a
 way
 that


makes
 them,
 you
 know,
 findable
 and


retrieved
 to
 be
 able
 to
 make
 sense
 of


them
 in
 a
 in
 a
 rag
 or
 a
 gentic
 rag


workflow.
 Very
 strong
 focus
 on
 again


retrieval
 accuracy
 with
 hybrid


retrieval,
 lots
 of
 features
 around


metadata,
 reranking,
 etc.
 And
 then
 we're


we're
 kind
 of
 known
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 work


around
 hallucination
 mitigation,
 both


hallucination
 detection
 and
 correction.


In
 fact,
 our
 hallucination
 detection


model,
 also
 called
 HHM,


has
 just
 passed
 5
 mill
 downloads
 about


couple
 months
 ago.
 I
 think
 it's
 at
 5.5


right
 now
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 And


generally
 our
 our
 operating
 system


platform
 is
 what
 you
 would
 need
 for


enterprisegrade
 deployment.
 So
 security,


role-
 based
 access
 controls,
 bring
 your


own
 model,
 custom
 prompts,


observability,
 monitoring,
 everything


you
 would
 need.


So


why
 does
 this
 matter?
 Well,
 in
 any


generative
 AI
 application,
 an
 enterprise


deep
 research
 is
 no
 different.


Hallucinations
 are
 still
 a
 problem
 and


you
 want
 to
 base
 your
 applications
 on


really
 robust
 information.
 In
 fact,
 this


is
 a
 statistics
 that
 shows
 that
 about


73%
 of
 LM
 customers
 implementing
 use


cases
 say
 that
 factual
 accuracy
 is
 their


top
 challenge
 right
 now.
 So
 that's
 why


we
 spend
 so
 much
 time
 in
 hallucination


mitigation
 which
 enables
 enterprise
 deep


research
 at
 really
 high
 quality.


Okay,
 so
 with
 that
 in
 mind,
 let
 me
 jump


into
 what
 is
 deep
 research.
 Deep


research
 itself
 is
 something
 many
 of
 you


probably
 know
 already.
 It's
 when
 an
 AI


agent
 conducts
 indepth
 multi-step


investigation,


usually
 by
 autonomously
 browsing
 or


searching
 the
 web
 in
 some
 way,
 getting


results,
 synthesizing
 all
 these
 results


together
 to
 generate
 a
 comprehensive


report
 for
 you
 with
 citations
 and
 all


the
 information
 you
 need
 to
 answer
 a


particular
 question.
 Many
 have


implemented
 this
 sort
 of
 web-
 based
 deep


research.
 Gemini
 or
 Google
 has
 that
 chat


GPT
 anthropic
 perplexity
 etc.
 Here's
 an


example
 what
 it
 looks
 like.
 If
 you


haven't
 used
 it,
 I
 highly
 encourage
 you


to
 use
 it.
 It's
 a
 very
 powerful
 tool.


And
 I
 use
 this
 all
 the
 time.
 This
 is
 the


screenshot
 of
 how
 you
 choose
 it
 in


Gemini,
 for
 example.
 And
 here's
 how
 you


choose
 it
 in
 Chat
 GPT.
 And
 this
 is


usually
 something
 that
 takes
 about,
 you


know,
 20
 30
 minutes
 to
 complete
 because


it
 does
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 underneath
 the


covers.


Now,
 enterprise
 deep
 research,
 think


about
 it
 as
 exactly
 the
 same
 idea
 only


now
 it
 goes
 to
 your
 private
 data.
 So


again
 the
 same
 process
 multi-
 aent
 with


reflection
 with
 synthesis
 of
 the
 final


results
 parallel
 execution
 of
 of
 agents


underneath
 and
 it
 queries
 your


enterprise
 data
 of
 course
 using
 in
 this


case
 victarogentic
 rank
 capabilities


with
 all
 the
 bells
 and
 whistles
 of
 high


accuracy
 and
 hallucination
 mitigation


and
 then
 we
 have
 corpus
 understanding


which
 allows
 you
 to
 plan
 properly
 based


on
 your
 data.


There
 are
 many
 really
 amazing
 use
 cases


for
 this
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 just
 mention
 a


few
 here
 that
 I
 like.
 One
 is
 responding


to
 an
 RFP.
 I've
 had
 this
 in
 my
 career


multiple
 times
 when
 you
 have
 to
 respond


to
 an
 RFP
 and
 getting
 the
 answers
 to
 150


questions
 is
 really
 difficult.
 So
 having


being
 able
 to
 use
 enterprise
 deep


research
 to
 go
 through
 all
 of
 your


enterprise
 data
 sets,
 picking
 up
 the


right
 documents
 and
 answering
 those


questions
 is
 a
 really
 cool
 use
 case.


Employee
 on
 boarding
 is
 this
 idea
 of
 if


you
 come
 to
 a
 new
 team
 or
 you
 join
 a
 new


company
 and
 a
 company
 wants
 to
 onboard


you
 quickly,
 it's
 usually
 very


difficult.
 Nobody
 knows
 what's
 going
 on.


There's
 no
 like
 onboarding
 guide.
 The


last
 one
 was
 generated
 three
 years
 ago


and
 it's
 not
 up
 to
 date
 etc.
 So
 again


being
 able
 to
 generate
 a
 ondemand


onboarding
 guide
 using
 all
 the


documentation
 we
 have
 on
 Jira
 or
 on


notion
 or
 Google
 Drive
 or
 SharePoint.


very
 very
 powerful.


And
 then
 in
 different
 industries
 there's


also
 different
 use
 cases.
 For example,


in
 financial
 services
 you
 might
 have
 the


generation
 of
 an
 investment
 memo
 as
 a


really
 cool
 use
 case.
 And
 you
 can


imagine
 the
 same
 thing
 in
 healthcare,
 in


insurance
 and
 other
 industries
 as
 well.


So
 those
 are
 some
 of
 the
 use
 cases.


There's
 a
 lot
 more
 I'm
