After the controversy over the Congressional Reform Bill in the Legislative Yuan
Many people went to the Legislative Yuan to protest against black box operations
Some people call this the Sunflower Movement 2.0
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Hundreds of people shouted slogans to reject the black box and stop voting</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Protest that Blue and White violates procedural justice</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>The crowds even paralyzed nearby roads</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>It’s like a replica of Sunflower 2.0</font>
But this time the Legislative Yuan’s Operation Bluebird
But unlike the Sunflower Student Movement 10 years ago, which attracted broad public participation
Why do some mass movements succeed and others fail?
The book I’m going to face today is “Why Take to the Streets?” 》
Let’s talk about the resistance techniques used in mass movements around the world.
The author of this book is American anthropologist David Graeber
He is also one of the founders of the Occupy Wall Street movement.
This movement made the world rethink capitalism
Arguably the most successful social movement of the 21st century
worth to learn from
In today’s video we will introduce
How to organize nonviolent protest actions
How will the state suppress mass movements?
How to realize direct democracy in mass movements
Occupy Wall Street in the United States
The Jasmine Revolution in Arab Countries
France’s yellow vest movement
And Taiwan’s Sunflower Student Movement
These mass movements all have one characteristic
They are all concepts that the people long for democracy.
But I feel betrayed by the government
Living in a democratic country today, we often feel a contradiction
on the one hand
People shouted that we should cherish our hard-won democracy
But at the same time, people think that democracy is just about electing the president once every four years.
After the election, people continue to go back and become slaves
After being elected, politicians engage in various forms of vote hopping, corruption, and avoidance of cases.
As a result, many people think politics is a dirty word
So people support democracy on the one hand
But in daily life, I don’t really believe that I can make the decision.
On the contrary, after the mass movement broke out
People finally feel that democracy has been achieved
To understand where this contradiction comes from
We must look back at history
It is generally believed that the nation originated in ancient Greece
Until after the founding of the United States
Became the first democratic country in history
But actually
The founding fathers of the United States were all anti-democratic
Nowhere in the Declaration of Independence or the U.S. Constitution does it mention that the United States is a democracy.
Because before the 19th century
Democracy is actually a dirty word
Democracy means something close to mob rule
long before american independence
There have been many mass rallies held because of people’s dissatisfaction.
Everyone can express themselves
This is similar to direct democracy in ancient Greece
The American War of Independence was also in the name of the people
The United States relied on the force of the masses to achieve independence.
So it stands to reason
After American Independence
All people should have the right to participate in politics
But at that time, John Adams, the founding father of the United States, said
The direct democracy of ancient Athens cannot be practiced in the United States
Because of large-scale public gatherings
Will bring terror to democracy
Why were the Founding Fathers so afraid of Greek democracy?
Because after the founding of the United States
Many farmers' debts have not been eliminated
Several popular uprisings broke out
Demand cancellation of debts and redistribution of land
and give citizens greater democratic control over
Pennsylvania was the first state to repeal property qualifications for democratic voting
Start building the People's Assembly
This series of grassroots democratic movements
The founding fathers of the United States were horrified
John Adams said:
if all things
All decided by the majority of 9 million people in the United States
Wouldn't they want to take away the rights of the property-owning minority?
They will demand debt cancellation
Heavy taxes on the rich
distribute property equally
This kind of democracy is a form of majority violence
Eventually the rich class will be wiped out
To prevent crowds from gathering
When the Founding Fathers of the United States wrote the Constitution
I decided not to give the masses too much power.
Instead, institutions of checks and balances are set up to limit the rights of the people.
So the United States is not essentially a democratic country
But a republic
A republic means that people elect representatives of their people
It is up to these representatives to participate in assemblies and manage the government
James Madison's reason at that time was
Well-trained elites know better than the general public what is good for the people
But the reason behind it is actually the fear of the people taking power
Therefore, the representative democracy in the United States is actually a republic at its core.
It is to let the people elect a group of elite leaders to obey
Wait, what if the founding fathers of the United States were anti-democratic?
Why is the United States now called a democracy?
In fact, until the mid-19th century
Democracy is used to call the electoral system
It was U.S. President Andrew Jackson who first advertised himself as a democrat.
It means defending the interests of the common people against the upper class
So the word democracy was a campaign marketing technique at that time.
Later, with the spread of suffrage,
More and more citizens can elect political representatives
Many people use "democracy" to refer to the electoral system of a "republic"
After World War I, the West began to spread a concept
Democracy is about letting the people vote for representatives
This political innovation originated from the ancient Greeks
It is a Western invention
But this statement actually deviates from the direct democracy of ancient Greece.
Because the people can only vote for their representatives
and have no way to participate in political decision-making
In comparison
Many indigenous societies around the world have traditions of direct democracy
For example, Madagascar has village meetings (fokon'olona)
Used to discuss how to resolve disputes and allocate irrigation water
Or Native American societies, also tribal direct democracy
However, because it does not have representative voting like in the West, it is not considered a democracy by Western scholars.
Later, anthropologists discovered through research that
It’s not that the indigenous people in these societies don’t know how to vote.
But deliberately avoid voting
Because the voting system forces the minority to obey the majority
Will bring about social division
Majority democracy relies on state power to enforce the law
The minority will be punished if they disobey the majority
In comparison
Pre-independence mass parliament in the United States
democratic conference of aboriginal societies
direct democracy in ancient greece
These early direct democracies in human history
Everyone can directly participate in political decision-making
from this angle
The mass movement is actually reviving the direct democracy of early mankind.
Find alternatives to today’s corrupted representative politics
No longer relying on voting and parliamentary systems
Instead, collective action is used to achieve a society that allows the people to be autonomous.
Social movements must be effective
Rely on those in action to know how to adapt in a timely manner
Stay tactically flexible
So it is impossible to write a mass movement manual
For example, the core issue of the movement: how to mobilize the masses
There is no formula
Like the 2011 Egyptian Revolution
A major contributor behind this is the "April 6 Youth Movement"
After a group of young people announced the demonstration on Facebook
Immediately under surveillance by the Egyptian police
Under this kind of state surveillance
These young people suddenly had a whim
They know that Egyptian taxi drivers like to chat on their walkie-talkies
So they told the driver
I heard there is a meeting at Jifang Square this afternoon
The result was a few hours later
Everyone in Cairo knew the march was coming
This kind of mobilization trick
Just use the local taxi network to spread the news
We can divide all sports into two types of organizations
One is a hierarchical power structure
There is a command team in the movement
Someone is responsible for negotiating with the police and government authorities
For example, the Sunflower Student Movement has a clear command team in the Legislative Yuan
Serve as the decision-making core of the forum
The advantage of this kind of organization is that the chain of command is clear
Efficient in decision-making
But it may cause other people's voices to be ignored
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Inside the Legislative Yuan</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>The students have decided to leave</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>However, it also triggered rumors of internal divisions</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Because there is another group of people</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>They are unwilling to leave</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>12 o'clock last night</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>The convener also quickly held an emergency meeting</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Then the controversy caused by Lin Feifan announcing his withdrawal for this event</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Apologize to friends</font>
Therefore, the author advocates another organizational method
It is a horizontal power structure
no commander
Instead, use "direct democracy by consensus"
What is consensus decision?
That is, everyone can participate equally in decision-making
And no one needs to submit to actions they don’t support
Occupy Wall Street is consensus-based democracy
There will be a "vibe watcher" on site
Always observe whether any people feel that their opinions are not being heard.
But so many people participated
How to achieve consensus?
The author lists several basic principles
First, if anyone has any opinions on the proposal, they must be taken into consideration
Second, any opposition must be dealt with
Third: If someone thinks that the proposal violates the basic spirit of the movement, the proposal can be rejected
This is called a blocker
Like a judge declaring a bill unconstitutional
Goes against the spirit of a group
Fourth: No one should be forced to obey decisions with which they disagree.
Such people are called bystanders
Even if I don't participate in this operation, I won't stop you from doing so.
This kind of consensus-based democracy is different from voting democracy.
Voting Democracy is:
As long as I vote for a majority, I win.
If I win, I can ignore the opposition.
But the consensus is to constantly revise it by listening to opposing opinions.
until a proposal becomes possible to be accepted by all
Wait, doesn’t this mean you’re trying to please everyone?
In fact, different viewpoints learn from each other
Instead, creativity can arise from ambiguity.
For example, in the 1990s
Mexico's indigenous people launch Zapatista revolution
Many intellectuals from cities joined the movement
The then deputy commander-in-chief Subcomandante Marcos believed that
Democracy means majority rule
However, the local indigenous people have their own tradition of tribal councils and prefer consensus decision-making.
Finally, both parties made a creative synthesis
Aboriginal people can elect representatives
But as long as the representative violates the community consensus
The tribe can depose him immediately
This is what happened after the two sides exchanged views
Creatively combines the advantages of majority rule and consensus decision
This kind of creative synthesis happens to be a valuable resource in social movements
Because in social movements
You will often meet people who have the same goals as you but prefer different strategies
This kind of consensus decision-making organization has been criticized by feminist Jo Freeman.
Say this is tyranny without structure
Consensus is known as a horizontal organization
But there will still be hidden leaders behind these movements.
Like the organizational group behind the stage
Or those people on stage with microphones
The author pointed out
To prevent movement founders from becoming the core of power
You have to pay attention to the conductor holding the microphone
Just control the time you give others to speak
I can’t make proposals myself
Some people may want to be in the limelight and become student stars
At this time, you must rely on people within the group to remind themselves
Don’t let people who want to stand out blur the focus.
The focus should be on achieving the goals of the movement
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Huang Guochang faced the anti-service trade issue in front of the camera</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>But often full of firepower</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>The famous speaker was speechless</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Being named the God of War by the students</font>
Also be careful
in the process of struggle
Certain political parties, organizations and groups will take the opportunity to infiltrate
Because everyone wants to share the fruits of the movement
Take the people in the direction they want
For example, Occupy Wall Street was originally a voluntary initiative by the people
But the initial mass meeting
The stage was occupied by the Workers World Party (WWP)
Turn the scene into their caucus
So the author saw that something was wrong
Immediately find someone else to move the position
Only then did we prevent this movement from being controlled by any political party.
After establishing the organizational structure
The next step is to show various "resistance dramas"
gain public support
Let more people join the movement
For example in 2010
British people launch anti-austerity movement (UK Uncut)
Artists gathered on site to make special paintballs
Put some paint into the water balloon and use it to hit the target
This will not cause real harm, but also can present a dramatic visual effect
Or activists giving speeches in the banking hall of HSBC
The topic of the speech is Bank Tax Evasion
And then run away before the police come to arrest you.
<font color=#FFDC00FF>HSBC pays your taxes! </font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>HSBC pay your tax!</font>
Take pictures of this kind of performance and upload it to the Internet
to achieve an expansion effect
Let the villagers feel:
Wow, it’s so lively. I want to join in.
Make people eager to participate
You can also be creative
Come up with catchy slogans to gain legitimacy for the movement
This is called "cultural framing" by sociologists
For example, in the Occupy Wall Street movement
The author came up with the slogan "We are the 99% of the people"
<font color=#FFDC00FF>We are the ninety nine %.</font> <font color=#FFDC00FF>we are the ninety nine %
.</font>
Implying that both major parties in the United States represent the interests of the top 1%
We, the ignored people, are the vast 99%
This slogan immediately resonated with the public
Let the Occupy movement, which was originally only in New York, quickly spread to other cities in the United States
Eventually, major cities around the world joined in
into a global anti-capitalist movement
We have just introduced the techniques of mass movement
But when the mass movement develops to a certain extent,
The state may use various means to suppress
Looking back at history
The scripts for suppressing democratic movements in various countries are very similar.
The first step is to identify the leaders of the movement
destroy their moral authority
For example, after the Sunflower Movement started
Some people started to find out about the dark history between Lin Feifan and Chen Weiting
Use these people's personal ethics and scandals to attack the legitimacy of the movement
The second step is to spread rumors and vilify the movement itself.
Said these people have violent tendencies
For example, the anti-globalization movement at the WTO in Seattle in 2001
The author himself also participated
not long after
There was news in the media
Says activists will use violence
As a result, these activists have to go out of their way to make statements to the media.
Finally, the New York Times retracted its original report.
There is a third way to suppress social movements:
Deliberately causing chaos among the masses
The early days of the 2011 Egyptian revolution
Mubarak's government deliberately released criminals from prison
Let them go to middle-class neighborhoods to cause trouble.
local residents will have a feeling
You see, as soon as the revolution happens, the criminals come!
These revolutionaries are simply the source of social chaos!
During the Occupy Wall Street movement
American police also use the same tactics
Get drug dealers and criminals out of jail
Driving them on a bus to the Occupy Movement site to deliberately cause trouble
but surprisingly
Rebecca Solnit, a social activist present at the scene, discovered
During the Occupy Movement
Auckland's crime rate dropped 19%
Because the Occupy movement communities will provide free food
someone wants to listen to you
Everyone lives a life of mutual help
It will make people feel social unity
Those criminals who were released actually lived peacefully with members of social movements.
Criminologists have been studying for years but still don’t know how to solve urban crime problems
An answer actually emerged during the Occupy movement
Finally, the state has one more trick to suppress the movement.
Just to give the police a reason to suppress violently
Generally legal mass movements are peaceful assemblies
If there are no illegal police officers, there is no reason to suppress them.
So the higher-ups will "create reasons" to give the police
For example, the Wall Street movement was too peaceful
The police had no choice but to use public health as an excuse
Stigmatize occupied areas as dens of mobs
Said police must clear out regularly
To ensure local health
or during the egyptian revolution
Police arrest female protester
deliberately sexually assault them
This was actually done intentionally to show the male protesters.
to anger them
Let them fight with the police
This way the police can rationalize their crackdown
So any mass movement
We must all face the problem of state violence
the author thinks
If the assembly itself is legal
There was no need to negotiate with the police in the first place.
Because if you negotiate with the police
May lead to the emergence of authority structures in the movement
How many activists can the police arrest?
Make them an extension of the police force
For example, in the Occupy movement in Austin, USA
At the beginning, members of the movement set up camp directly in the local area.
Camping is a legal gray area
So some people on motorcycles went to ask the police.
Can we camp here?
It turns out because he asked
So the police can say
Your people have already negotiated with us
less than a few weeks later
The police will have more say
Austin's occupation failed
So what should we do if the police really start arresting people and suppressing them?
An effective method is
Cell phone video of police brutality
Let the video be distributed on the Internet
To expose state violence
On the contrary, you can get more sound volume for sports
<font color=#FFDC00FF>
it was noontime today in the center of Beijing,</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>
When a man walked to the middle of the avenue of eternal peace,</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>which as it happened was already occupied. </font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>He walked
to the middle and stood there.</font>
There's another way to deal with the police
is to make an unexpected move
Because police officers are trained with a set of SOPs
you behave abnormally
The police don't know how to deal with it
Must use radio to request instructions from superiors
For example, on Christmas Day in Copenhagen in 1974
Danish theater group Solvognen, planning a mass movement against capitalism
Demonstrators dressed as Santa Claus
Go to the store and take the product directly
Distributed to local children
Just like Santa Claus delivering gifts
This leaves the police wondering what to do
Because if the police beat Santa Claus in front of children,
The picture will be very ugly
The child's childhood was destroyed by you
So no matter what the police do, it's wrong
And the indigenous people of Mexico’s Chiapas oppose NAFTA.
Long-term demands for indigenous autonomy
But every time they mobilized, they were arrested by the police.
in 1994
They came up with a non-violent mobilization method
Let hundreds of aboriginal female children hold babies
Go to the Mexican military camp and fight
Whenever the military attacks activists, it will also attack these children and babies
It's like building a firewall
Let the military not dare to act rashly
<font color=#FFDC00FF>If you continue to allow this, continue to believe and accept the government’s orders</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>You are maintaining the power of the government</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>They have power precisely because people have been allowing these things</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Because you think we are enemies, but the real enemies are those in high positions above</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>And you are still here serving them</font>
These scenes have become classic scenes of protest in the history of social movements.
It wrote a victory for the common people against state violence.
Finally, the author will discuss
The question of whether violence can be used in mass movements
Whenever violence occurs in sports
Someone will shout that violence should not be used
We must be law-abiding citizens
But this statement cannot explain a problem
Why can the state legally use violence?
People will say it's because the state is enforcing the law
The legitimacy of the law comes from the constitution
But the legitimacy of the Constitution comes from all citizens
How did all the citizens create the constitution in the first place?
In fact, it relies on illegal armed revolution
That is violence
For example, the birth of the United States
It was the colonial people who rebelled against the British Empire
So those who say don't use violence have forgotten one thing
The reason why they can now enjoy free speech
It is the result of the previous efforts through violence.
For example, Gandhi himself supported nonviolent struggle
But when Indian guerrillas attacked British police
Gandhi also did not condemn
Instead he responded:
Non-violence is morally superior to violent resistance
Because nonviolence can highlight state violence
But violent resistance is better than people who do nothing.
So the problem is not that violence cannot be used
But what kind of violence is justified?
Because violent actions may be justified against a group
But it doesn't apply to another group at all
For example, Oakland in the United States is the city where the Mafia gang thrived.
The local African-American community itself has a tradition of violent resistance
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Panther as a symbol
. because the nature of Panther.</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Panther doesn't strike anyone ,</font> <font color=#FFDC00FF>Panther doesn't strike anyone
,</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>but when he
's assailed upon, he'll back up first.</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>But if the aggressor continues, then he'll strike out
.</font>
So the offensive tactics used in Oakland during the Occupy movement
People from other places seem to think it’s very extreme
But local people think it is a symbol of unity
So different regions have different traditions of struggle
the author thinks
Direct democratic mass movements should not use violence
Because when people use violence
It means that both parties refuse to reason and use force to suppress the other party.
But in terms of force
The national police force must be better than that of ordinary people
Therefore, ordinary people should use non-violent strategies to win the victory.
For example, Gandhi and Martin Luther King’s nonviolent struggle
It is to expose the violence hidden in the existing political order.
Because it is not illegal for people to assemble peacefully
protected by the constitution
but
If the police state machine commits violence against civilians without legal basis
The whole world will see state violence
This will remove the legitimacy of state power
Let the people win
The author puts forward an important concept here
prefigurative politics
prefigurative politics
What images of democracy do people imagine to hope for in the future?
We should show what the future looks like in our resistance actions
So if people want to build an equal, democratic society
should not be done during exercise
Replicating the oppressive logic of capitalism, patriarchy, and racial discrimination
For example, when occupying the Legislative Yuan
Some people pointed out that this movement ignored gender equality
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Our most exciting forum is about gender awareness</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>I’m so fucked and I’m telling you now</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Only women can call you fuck your mother</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>If this is not possible</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Not called progressive youth</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Don’t tell me you are a progressive young man</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Don’t tell me that Taiwan needs to progress</font>
If the movement itself pursues the spirit of democracy and freedom
Gender-oppressive language should not be reproduced in venues
Or someone went to the Legislative Yuan but was kicked out
Said these people are just here to gain traffic
<font color=#FFDC00FF>The host of the well-known podcast program Bailingguo also came to the scene</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>But because I once said that the Sunflower Student Movement was a joke</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>This time they were directly driven away by the people at the scene</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Tell them not to use traffic</font>
This doesn't look like a democratic society
Not a place where people can freely express their opinions
In comparison
The Occupy Wall Street movement practiced the spirit of portentous politics
Let the wealthy people representing the 1% enter the sports scene
Debate with the public on the spot
<font color=#FFDC00FF>What does this have to do with Walmart?</font> <font color=#FFDC00FF>What
does Walmart do with...?</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>You should go and ask the employees that are working in sweatshop type conditions</font> <font color=#FFDC00FF>You should go
and ask the employees that are working in sweatshop type conditions </font> >
<font color=#FFDC00FF>No time for oneself, no health care</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>that don't get enough hours, that don't have healthcare.</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>等等</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>wait a minute,</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Then why don’t they resign? </font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>then why don't they quit?</font>
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Walmart doesn't hold a gun to their head.</font> <font color=
#FFDC00FF>I mean Walmart doesn't hold a gun to their head.</font>
There are also many restaurant businesses
Free food that is about to expire will be delivered to the site
It can also help social activists
And avoid capitalist food waste
The Wall Street movement developed into the middle and late stages
Mutual aid groups gradually emerged
Volunteer to build free kitchens, medical areas, libraries, and audio-visual media areas
If we don’t believe in the capitalist theory of human nature
Think everyone is greedy and selfish
only for one's own benefit
Then we can practice the humanity we believe in in the Occupy movement
Create a community of mutual help and solidarity
This portentous politics distinguishes direct democracy from civil disobedience
Civil disobedience uses occupation as a means
The purpose is to demand democratization
So civil disobedient people are happy to be arrested
Because then they can argue in court
Bringing injustice within the system to the attention of those in power
thereby challenging the existing legal system
For example, in 1995
India’s Farmers’ Society (KRSS) smashes local KFC
Protests against cheap genetically modified food destroying livelihoods of Indian farmers
Destroying stores is a protest drama
Let the police arrest people
This way activists can go to court to complain about unjust laws
In comparison
Direct democratic action is not about asking those in power to make changes
Rather, it is about realizing democratic life directly in the occupied areas.
The action itself has achieved its purpose
For example, the anti-globalization movement in Europe
They will use smashing KFC and Starbucks as a symbol to oppose capitalist globalization.
But they don't wait for the police to come and arrest people after taking action
But leave directly
This seems strange to someone who is a civil disobedient.
The purpose of the protest is not to negotiate with the authorities
why are you running away
But for actors in direct democracy
Protest actions themselves are portentous politics
is to create a free space
when space is created
The purpose has been achieved
Occupy itself is about living a free life
let the world see
A free life is possible at any time
We don’t need to wait for those in power to negotiate with us to achieve democratic freedoms
Revolution as we used to understand it
All success must be achieved by seizing state power.
But sociologist Wallerstein pointed out
During the European Revolution of 1848
More than 50 countries around the world have followed suit
But in the end, none of the revolutionaries succeeded in gaining power.
Does that mean the revolution has failed?
it's not true
After the Revolution of 1848
Countries around the world began to compromise
Give citizens the right to education
Similarly, student movements broke out in various countries around the world in 1968
against government bureaucracy
And the United States did not listen to public opinion and launched the Vietnam War
These students are not trying to take over state power
Because state power itself is the source of social problems
This does not mean that the June 8th student movement was ineffective.
These student movements challenge segregation and gender discrimination
over the past half century
Improve the rights and interests of women and ethnic minorities
Looking back at history we will find
Mass movement is a long-term process of creating democratic culture
If we only focus on short-term legislation
You will feel that failure to achieve your goals is tantamount to failure.
But the movement in history that really drove human society forward
Abolition of slavery, labor rights, feminist movement, same-sex marriage
It took decades to get the results
Workers, minorities, women, and homosexuals should be protected by the legal system
This is considered common sense nowadays
but a century ago
These are very radical ideas
Mass movements are the source of these radical ideas
Open up a space for democratic creativity for the people
Free to express your creativity
to imagine the possibility of another social order
When democracy and freedom are no longer just theories and empty talk
But when the process is actually performed on the streets
The revolution has already begun
