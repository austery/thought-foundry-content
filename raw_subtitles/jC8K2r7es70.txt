There's
 The
 Secret
 Lives
 of
 Mormon


wives,
 Love
 Island,
 The
 Real
 Housewives


of
 practically
 every
 city
 you've
 ever


heard
 of.
 More
 than
 30
 years
 after
 the


reality
 TV
 genre
 really
 got
 going,
 it's


stronger
 than
 ever.
 So,
 what
 is
 it
 about


reality
 TV
 that
 keeps
 us
 coming
 back
 for


more?
 I
 talked
 to
 Kathy
 James,


co-president
 of
 Proper
 Television,


executive
 producer
 and
 showrunner
 of


Master
 Chef
 Canada,
 among
 other
 shows,


and
 Sarah
 Cresell,
 associate
 editor
 at


The
 Thai,
 about
 finding
 escape
 in


reality
 TV
 when
 reality
 itself
 is
 hard


to
 handle.


>> Kathy,
 Sarah,
 welcome
 to
 the
 program.


How
 are
 you
 guys
 doing?


>> Great.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 having
 us.


>> Thank
 you.


>> There
 are
 two
 types
 of
 entertainment


watching
 that's
 on
 the
 rise.
 reality
 TV


and
 then
 we
 have
 nostalgia
 TV
 and
 films.


I
 want
 to
 start
 with
 reality
 first.


Kathy,
 what
 do
 you
 think
 people
 are


looking
 for
 when
 they
 are
 watching


perhaps
 binging
 in
 my
 case
 reality
 TV?


>> Um,
 well,
 I
 don't
 know
 actually
 that


reality
 TV
 is
 on
 the
 rise.
 I
 think
 that


it
 is
 a
 a
 like
 a
 25
 year old
 genre
 now


and
 that
 it's
 had
 it
 it
 I
 think
 that
 I


don't
 even
 think
 of
 it
 necessarily
 as


popular.
 I
 think
 of
 it
 as
 entrenched
 in


the
 entertainment
 world
 and
 in
 our


culture,
 but
 there's
 certainly
 certain


shows
 that
 are
 doing
 extremely
 well
 and


are
 in
 the
 zeitgeist.
 And
 I
 understand


that
 you're
 a
 fan
 of
 one
 of
 those.


>> I
 am
 selling
 sunset.
 [laughter]


Guilty.
 Also
 watching.


>> Okay,
 good.


>> Also
 guilty.


>> So,
 what
 are
 we
 looking
 for
 when
 we're


we're
 watching
 these
 shows?


>> I
 think
 that
 everybody's
 looking
 for


something
 different.
 Um,
 I
 think
 the
 way


that
 I
 might
 watch
 it
 as
 a
 producer
 of


of
 um
 unscripted
 television
 might
 be
 a


little
 differently
 different
 than
 the


way
 that
 that
 you
 two
 watch
 it.
 Um,
 so


I'
 I'd
 like
 to
 turn
 it
 back
 to
 you
 two.


Like
 I
 cuz
 as
 the
 producer
 it's
 really


interesting
 for
 me
 to
 hear
 what
 you
 like


about
 it.


>> Okay.
 Well
 Sarah
 you
 had
 written
 an


article
 about
 your
 selling
 sunset
 habit


and
 you
 wrote
 more
 than
 anything
 it's


outsiz
 opulence
 drowns
 out
 the
 many


moments
 when
 I'm
 uncomfortably


confronted
 with
 the
 real
 life
 wealth


disparities
 all
 around
 me.
 I'm
 hoping


you
 could
 take
 us
 through
 sort
 of
 your


selling
 sunset
 journey
 because
 it
 was


sort
 of
 a
 a
 love
 maybe
 a
 love
 love


relationship
 but
 sort
 of
 turns
 into
 a


lovehate
 relationship.
 So
 for
 people
 who


aren't
 familiar
 with
 Selling
 Sunset,


what
 is
 the
 show
 and
 then
 walk
 us


through
 your
 journey.


>> Yeah,
 so
 Selling
 Sunset
 is
 kind
 of
 a


softly
 scripted
 uh
 docu
 Soap
 series.
 Um


it
 follows
 real
 estate
 agents
 who
 dress


up
 in
 glamorous
 outfits,
 increasingly


glamorous
 as
 the
 seasons
 go
 on.


>> Tuesday
 is
 the
 Metball
 for
 that.
 Yes,


let's
 be
 very
 clear.
 Yes,
 [laughter]


absolutely.
 And
 and
 that's
 part
 of
 the


fun,
 right?
 Um
 and
 yeah,
 they
 kind
 of


just
 they
 sell
 houses
 once
 in
 a
 while,


but
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 you
 can't
 go
 five


minutes
 without
 uh
 Cricelle
 and
 Emma


sitting
 on
 the
 edge
 of
 a
 multi-million


dollar
 mansion
 and
 talking
 about
 what


happened
 at
 Girls
 Giving,
 which
 are
 the


moments
 that
 I'm
 waiting
 for.
 Um
 and


yeah,
 my
 journey
 with
 with
 Selling


Sunset,
 it
 truly
 was
 a
 journey.
 I


remember
 texting
 friends
 being
 like,
 I


have
 started
 the
 selling
 sunset
 journey


because
 its
 popularity
 really
 exploded


um
 during
 the
 pandemic
 because
 it
 first


released
 in
 2019.
 Um
 and
 yeah,
 I
 I
 was


kind
 of
 in
 one
 of
 two
 states
 while


watching
 Selling
 Sunset.
 I
 was
 either,


you
 know,
 entrenched
 into
 the
 drama
 and


into
 the
 psychoanalyses
 and
 into
 the


funny
 awkward
 moments
 or,
 you
 know,
 I


was
 going
 through
 it
 and
 looking
 to


absolutely
 turn
 my
 brain
 off.
 Um,
 I


think
 the
 moment
 that
 the
 fantasy
 sort


of
 shattered
 a
 little
 bit
 for
 me
 was


earlier
 this
 year
 in
 January,
 a
 new


spin-off
 came
 out,
 which
 was
 Selling
 the


City,
 which
 takes
 place
 in
 New
 York


City.
 And
 I
 don't
 know,
 I
 kind
 of


recognized,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 exposed


pipe
 and
 the
 and
 the
 pylons
 and
 the


concrete
 jungle
 of
 New
 York
 City
 in
 in


my
 own
 city
 of
 Toronto.
 And
 I
 I
 started


to
 just
 feel
 like
 I
 was
 coming
 down
 to


earth
 a
 little
 bit
 again.
 and
 and
 yeah,


the
 fantasy
 wasn't
 wasn't
 so
 much


working
 anymore.
 And
 I
 kind
 of


remembered,
 you
 know,
 all
 the
 the
 issues


of
 of
 housing
 unaffordability
 and
 the


homelessness
 crisis
 and,
 you
 know,


people's
 inability
 to
 pay
 rent
 and
 buy


groceries.
 So,
 these
 people
 aren't
 that


far
 off
 from
 us.
 They're
 they're
 they're


around
 us.
 Some
 [laughter]
 people
 will


talk
 about
 uh
 unscripted
 TV
 reality


shows
 as
 a
 form
 of
 escapism
 and
 they
 may


make
 some
 associations
 that
 it
 is
 you


know
 perhaps
 a
 bit
 lazy
 uh
 some
 guilty


pleasure
 watching
 uh
 but
 these
 days


there's
 also
 this
 term
 of
 rot
 day.
 What


is
 that?
 Okay,
 so
 the
 rot
 day
 is


basically
 when
 you
 are
 absolutely


allowing
 yourself
 to
 be
 horizontal


as
 long
 as
 you
 need
 to
 be.
 Binge
 as
 many


episodes
 guilt-free
 as
 you
 need
 to.
 Um,


you
 know,
 have
 your
 favorite
 hot


chocolate
 or
 tea
 or
 whatever
 it
 is
 you


want.
 Um,
 and
 just
 and
 and
 kind
 of
 rest


and
 lean
 into
 um
 a
 level
 of
 rest
 that
 is


considered
 radical
 these
 days.
 Um,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 Gen
 Z's
 way.
 This


trend
 is
 a
 reflection
 of
 our
 greater


collective
 rejection
 against
 hustle


culture
 and
 productivity
 culture.
 Um


especially
 in
 a
 time
 when
 we're
 dealing


with
 symptoms
 of
 you
 know
 latestage


capitalism
 and
 and
 being
 exhausted
 from


meaningless
 jobs
 and
 and
 being


increasingly
 isolated
 in
 our
 individual


lifestyles
 of
 you
 know
 working
 from
 home


and
 perfecting
 our
 gym
 routine
 and


watching
 our
 little
 prestige
 television


show
 and
 then
 going
 to
 bed
 and
 doing
 it


over
 and
 over
 again.
 And
 I
 think
 it's


kind
 of
 a
 reflection
 of
 um
 our
 our
 lack


of
 community
 and
 our
 lack
 of
 uh
 of
 touch


with
 a
 purpose
 and
 fulfillment
 in
 in
 our


generation.
 That's
 not
 for
 everybody.


Rot
 days
 are
 beautiful
 and
 and
 healthy


and
 and
 necessary.
 Um
 but
 yeah,
 I
 think


it's
 a
 reflection
 of
 of
 a
 greater


problem
 sometimes.
 Kevin,
 I
 want
 your


take
 on
 this
 as
 as
 someone
 who
 as
 you


mentioned
 who
 makes
 this
 television,
 not


selling
 Senset,
 but
 you
 know,
 if
 we're


mentioning
 shows,
 The
 Great
 Canadian


Bake
 Show,
 Master
 Chef
 Canada,
 we've
 got


Listing
 Large,
 which
 is
 a
 real
 estate


show.
 So,


>> listening
 to
 uh
 what
 Sarah
 has
 to
 say,


does
 that
 is
 that
 something
 that
 is
 in


your
 brain
 thinking
 about
 when
 you're


producing
 some
 of
 these
 shows?


>> Um,
 well,
 I
 I
 definitely
 I
 I
 definitely


want
 to
 create
 an
 enjoyable
 experience.


I
 think
 that,
 you
 know,
 all


entertainment,
 whether
 it's
 reading
 or


movies,
 is
 a
 form
 of
 escape.
 You
 know,


in
 the
 19th
 century,
 people
 were
 scolded


for
 reading
 too
 much.
 And
 now,
 you
 know,


it's
 interesting
 to
 think
 of
 a
 rot
 where


really
 you're
 just
 immersing
 yourself
 in


more
 rot
 because
 the
 cycle
 of
 reality
 TV


and
 digital
 culture
 and
 inquisitiveness


and
 aspiration
 is
 all
 cycled
 throughout


the
 culture.
 You're
 not
 escaping
 it
 when


you
 immerse
 yourself
 in
 selling
 sunset.


You're
 actually
 embracing
 it.


>> Um
 I
 think
 that
 you
 know
 the
 interesting


thing
 about
 reality
 television
 and


reality
 is
 a
 terrible


you
 know
 way
 to
 to
 talk
 about
 any
 any


form
 of
 entertainment
 even
 documentary.


Nothing
 is
 real
 once
 you
 edit
 it
 and
 and


you
 know
 contract
 it
 into
 an
 hour
 or
 a


twohour
 package.


>> But
 I
 think
 that
 um
 what
 what's


interesting
 about
 unscripted
 television


is
 that
 it
 is
 actually
 can
 be
 highly


authentic


within
 a
 very
 constructed
 package.
 And


when
 it
 works,
 even
 with
 something
 as


contrived
 as
 selling
 sunset
 where,
 as


you
 mentioned,
 you
 know,
 women
 are


dressed,
 you
 know,
 to
 go
 to,
 you
 know,


like
 for
 like
 a,
 you
 know,
 a
 black
 tie


party
 when
 they're
 going
 to
 show
 a
 house


at
 like,
 you
 know,
 3:00
 in
 the


afternoon.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 absurd.
 the
 that


show
 is
 is
 shot
 and
 lit
 and
 and
 the
 and


the
 participants
 even
 though
 they
 are


real
 people
 behaving
 and
 acting
 as


themselves
 in
 their
 own
 lives
 it
 is
 all


fully
 produced
 in
 a
 way
 that
 most


unscripted
 television
 isn't
 because


frankly
 we
 don't
 have
 the
 budget
 for


that
 right


>> but
 what
 I
 would
 say
 is
 that
 you
 know


reality
 TV
 works
 or
 unscripted


television
 works
 even
 on
 selling
 sunset


because
 despite
 all
 the
 contrivance
 it


gets
 at
 something
 that
 people
 are


connecting
 to.


>> I'm
 hoping
 you
 can
 pull
 the
 curtain
 for


us
 a
 little
 bit
 in
 terms
 of
 considering


casting
 for
 shows
 that
 you
 work
 on.


>> What
 makes
 a
 good
 character?


>> It
 really
 depends
 on
 on
 what
 you're


going
 for.
 Like


>> that's
 an
 example.
 Yeah,
 for
 Well,
 at


for
 the
 Great
 Canadian
 Baking
 Show,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 that
 for
 some
 culinary


shows,
 um,
 because
 the
 objective
 of
 that


particular
 show
 is
 that
 this
 is
 going
 to


change
 your
 life.
 We
 want
 to
 see
 people


sort
 of
 battle
 it
 out.
 We
 want
 to
 see,


you
 know,
 some
 some
 conflict
 which
 might


actually
 mimic
 an
 authentic
 uh


environment
 on
 the
 on
 the
 line
 at
 a
 at
 a


high-end
 kitchen.
 We
 we
 may
 we
 may
 cast


for
 a
 mix
 of
 personality
 and
 cooking


skill
 for
 something
 like
 The
 Great


Canadian
 Baking
 Show.
 Obviously,
 we
 look


for
 people
 who
 Canadians
 are
 going
 to


love.
 We
 look
 at
 at
 how
 we
 represent
 the


country
 as
 a
 whole
 geographically,


demographically,
 but
 you
 really
 really


need
 to
 be
 a
 great
 baker.
 I
 mean,
 if
 for


that
 particular
 show,
 that
 audience


wants
 to
 see
 people
 who
 are


>> artists
 and
 we
 we
 spend
 a
 great
 deal
 of


time
 um
 you
 know
 talking
 to
 them,


testing
 them
 and
 and
 interviewing
 them


to
 get
 a
 sense
 of
 their
 skill
 level.
 um


for
 something
 like
 Listing
 Large,
 which


was
 a
 group
 of
 real
 estate
 agents
 based


in
 uh
 um
 I
 think
 the
 northern
 part
 of
 uh


Toronto,
 we
 it
 it
 was
 anchored
 by
 a
 onag


again
 off-again
 couple
 that
 ended
 up


coming
 together
 and
 getting
 married
 and


having
 two
 kids
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 show.


I
 mean,
 thank
 God
 for
 that
 because
 that


real
 life
 thing
 that
 was
 happening


really
 drove
 the
 story
 of
 the
 show.
 But,


you
 know,
 it
 was
 against
 the
 background


of
 of
 beautiful
 Toronto
 real
 estate.
 But


the,
 you
 know,
 the
 would
 not
 have
 have


had
 the
 chance
 to
 have
 their
 lives
 um,


you
 know,
 on
 camera
 if
 they
 weren't
 also


extraordinarily
 good-looking
 and
 very


charismatic,


>> right?
 That
 all
 plays
 in.
 I
 want
 to
 pick


up
 on
 sort
 of
 the
 competition
 aspect
 of


it.
 We
 see
 this
 even
 in
 dating
 shows.


Uh,
 we
 can
 name
 a
 bunch
 of
 them.
 Um
 but


the
 there
 is
 what
 is
 it
 about
 sort
 of


upping
 the
 ante
 that
 has
 created
 or
 or


does
 it
 create
 a
 higher
 viewership
 uh


when
 there
 is
 a
 something
 at
 stake?


>> That's
 a
 good
 question.
 Yeah,
 I
 think


you
 know
 there's
 there's
 two
 kinds
 of


stakes
 in
 in
 my
 view
 in
 my
 experience


either
 consuming
 these
 kinds
 of
 stories


or
 even
 trying
 to
 write
 them
 sometimes.


I
 think
 there's
 the
 external
 stakes,


which
 is,
 you
 know,
 are
 they
 gonna,
 in


the
 case
 of
 selling
 sunset,
 are
 they


going
 to
 sell
 this
 this
 million-dollar


mansion,
 is
 my
 client
 who
 wants
 to
 sell


his
 house
 for
 $75
 million
 going
 to
 um
 be


mad
 at
 me
 if
 I
 don't
 sell
 his
 house
 for


an
 exorbitant
 amount
 of
 money?
 Um,
 and


then
 there's
 the
 internal
 stakes,
 you


know,
 there's
 the
 characters
 that
 we


come
 to
 know
 and
 love.
 I
 think
 um


Cricelle
 has
 become
 such
 a
 fan
 favorite


on
 that
 show
 and
 she
 kind
 of
 has
 a


perfect
 um
 narrative
 to
 contribute
 in
 a


space
 where
 you
 know
 we
 see
 a
 lot
 of


wealth,
 a
 lot
 of
 opulence.
 um
 she
 kind


of
 has
 this
 experience
 with
 homelessness


and
 it
 kind
 of
 aligns
 with
 um
 a
 lot
 of


viewers
 values
 around
 you
 know
 the


American
 dream
 and
 and
 getting
 out
 of
 um


a
 tough
 situation
 and
 that
 it
 is


possible
 um
 to
 aspire
 to
 to
 to
 be
 like


and
 look
 like
 the
 people
 who
 are
 on
 our


screens
 and
 it
 is
 fantasy
 but
 it
 kind
 of


does
 get
 to
 you
 on
 that
 subconscious


level.
 So
 yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 upping


the
 stakes
 like
 that
 um
 both
 externally


and
 emotionally
 is
 what
 makes
 us
 connect


to
 it
 so
 much
 as
 Kathy
 said


>> with
 that
 connection
 there
 is
 also
 a


community
 uh
 that
 is
 built
 on
 social


media
 perhaps
 for
 example
 but
 how
 might


and
 I'll
 bring
 back
 the
 rot
 but
 you
 know


how
 might
 that
 be
 costing
 is
 there
 a


cost
 to
 it
 in
 in
 sort
 of
 real
 life


community
 when
 we
 are
 watching
 shows


like
 this


>> I
 think
 so
 I
 I
 thought
 a
 lot
 about
 this


with
 my
 own
 journey
 with
 selling


uh
 selling
 sunset
 and
 and
 its
 spin-off


shows.
 You
 know,
 I
 I
 got
 really
 into
 it


and
 and
 like
 I
 mentioned
 earlier,
 there


was
 a
 time
 when
 I
 I
 gave
 myself
 a
 rot,


but
 it
 wasn't
 it
 wasn't
 a
 great
 rot
 day.


It
 was
 one
 of
 those
 days
 where
 I
 think
 I


binge
 watched
 too
 one
 too
 many
 episodes.


Um,
 and
 I
 started
 to
 kind
 of
 question,


you
 know,
 if
 I
 wasn't
 constantly
 chasing


the
 comfort
 of
 reality
 television,
 um,
 I


might
 be
 facing
 the
 uncomfortable
 and


discomfort
 of,
 um,
 my
 actual
 reality.


Um,
 and
 if
 I
 was
 present
 with
 that
 more,


if
 I
 wasn't
 so
 avoidant
 with
 it,
 and
 if


we
 didn't
 have
 um,
 the
 urge
 to


constantly
 run
 to
 this,
 you
 know,
 no


shortage
 of
 entertainment
 that
 we
 have


these
 days,
 what
 would
 we
 be
 doing


instead?
 And
 I
 started
 to
 question,
 you


know,
 who
 might
 I
 be
 or
 what
 sort
 of
 um


what
 what
 ways
 would
 I
 get
 to
 know


myself
 more
 and
 what
 ways
 would
 I
 maybe


get
 to
 know
 my
 own
 values
 more
 and
 even


pour
 those
 values
 into
 action,
 whether


that's
 community
 organizing
 or
 or
 just


showing
 up
 for
 my
 next
 door
 neighbor
 or


or
 thinking
 more
 clearly
 about
 what
 I


want
 to
 spend
 my
 my
 very
 little
 extra


time
 doing.
 Um,
 yeah.


>> Very
 quickly,
 I
 uh
 before
 I
 get
 to
 my


last
 question
 too,
 what
 do
 you
 see
 in


terms
 of
 the
 community
 that's
 built


behind
 some
 of
 these
 shows?
 Some
 of


these
 shows
 resonate
 with
 a
 lot
 of


people.
 We
 talked
 just
 before
 we
 rolled


about
 uh
 you
 know,
 the
 great
 Canadian


Boff
 just
 all
 the
 connection
 there.
 But


what
 are
 you
 seeing
 from
 the
 community


uh
 that
 you've
 sort
 of
 cultivated
 with


these
 shows?
 I
 you
 know
 I
 think
 the
 fans


really
 cultivate
 it
 themselves
 and
 it
 we


don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 control
 over
 that


and
 it's
 a
 really
 interesting
 thing
 to


see
 and
 you
 know
 it's
 interesting
 on
 on


something
 like
 selling
 sunset
 I
 think


the
 stakes
 supposedly
 as
 you
 say
 are


about
 selling
 homes
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 a


lot
 of
 homes
 get
 sold


>> I
 don't
 think
 so
 [laughter]


>> I
 think
 the
 real
 stakes
 among
 among


those
 women
 and
 why
 it
 is
 authentic
 and


it
 it
 or
 this
 is
 the
 authent


authenticity
 I
 think
 that
 the
 audience


relates
 to
 is
 it
 is
 a
 blood
 match
 for


social
 media
 popularity


>> and
 so
 many
 of
 the
 things
 that
 play
 out


on
 that
 show
 are
 really
 connected
 to


what
 is
 going
 on
 behind
 the
 scenes
 in


their
 social
 media.


>> All
 right,
 we
 have
 less
 than
 a
 minute.


One
 question
 for
 both
 of
 you.
 I
 want
 to


turn
 our
 attention
 to
 nostalgia.
 Um
 from


TV
 to
 vinyl
 records
 and
 analog


technology,
 we
 are
 seeing
 this
 being


documented.
 talk
 about
 Gen
 Z's


for
 as
 a
 millennial
 it's
 a
 nice
 little


pulse
 check
 to
 see
 what
 you
 know
 what


the
 kids
 are
 up
 to
 and
 into
 these
 days


and
 we
 know
 that
 we're
 you
 know
 what's


trending
 uh
 but
 in
 tough
 times
 it
 seems


like
 everyone
 wants
 to
 go
 back
 to
 what


they
 think
 as
 a
 simpler
 time
 a
 simpler


past
 and
 I
 am
 just
 curious
 what
 is
 your


go-to
 nostalgia
 or
 escape
 binge
 perhaps


and
 why


>> I've
 I've
 got
 to
 say
 Gilmore
 Girls
 um
 I


am
 that
 person
 who
 went
 to
 journalism


school
 and
 is
 still
 obsessed
 with
 that


show.
 I
 mean,
 I
 watched
 Gilmore
 Girls,


you
 know,
 Saturday
 mornings
 or
 Sunday


mornings
 on,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 the
 W


channel
 with
 my
 mom
 and
 when
 uh
 the


episode
 got
 a
 little
 too
 inappropriate


for
 my
 age
 and
 for
 my
 strict
 parents,
 my


mom
 would
 change
 the
 channel
 if
 my
 dad


was
 in
 the
 room.
 Um,
 but
 you
 know,
 that


show
 is
 just
 quintessential
 comfort.
 It


it
 takes
 place
 uh
 you
 know,
 throughout


the
 beautiful
 seasons
 in
 this
 small


town.
 Um,
 and
 I
 watch
 it
 every
 single


fall
 and
 it
 just
 reminds
 me
 of,
 you


know,
 watching
 this
 show
 with
 hilarious


banter
 and
 iconic
 flawed
 characters.
 Um,


every
 every
 weekend
 with
 my
 mom
 and
 my


sister
 and
 yeah,
 it
 just
 hits
 every


time.
 I
 don't know
 what
 to
 say.
 Every


single
 fall,
 it
 never
 misses.
 All
 right,


[laughter]
 Kathy,
 as
 someone
 who
 works


in
 TV,
 I
 don't
 know,
 maybe
 I'm
 assuming


that
 it's
 it's
 something,
 you
 know,
 that


you're
 watching,
 but
 perhaps
 something


else
 that
 uh
 that
 brings
 back
 uh
 some


nostalgia,
 but
 also
 takes
 you
 back
 to


simpler
 times.


>> You
 know,
 the
 way
 that
 nostalgia
 is


playing
 out
 for
 me
 lately
 is
 in
 the


kinds
 of
 shows
 that
 we
 are
 developing.


And
 um
 one
 of
 the
 shows
 that
 I'm
 I'm


developing
 right
 now
 is
 a
 dating
 show


that
 takes
 people
 back
 in
 time
 to
 uh
 a


university
 campus
 in
 which
 they're


immersed
 in
 basically
 a
 time
 capsule
 and


and
 and
 I
 think
 that
 it
 really
 and
 and


you
 know
 it's
 interesting
 because
 it


involves
 people
 like
 Gen
 Xers
 going
 back


to
 an
 80s
 college
 campus
 but
 when
 I
 talk


to
 younger
 people
 they
 love
 the
 idea


idea
 because
 the
 idea
 of
 dating
 and
 and


and
 having
 community
 and
 meeting
 people


in
 an
 in
 an
 analog
 world
 is
 really
 plays


into
 this
 nostalgia
 for
 a
 simpler
 time.


>> All
 right,
 we
 are
 going
 to
 leave
 it


there.
 We
 will
 keep
 our
 eyes
 out
 for


[laughter]
 that
 show.
 Fingers
 crossed.


All
 right,
 Kathy,
 Sarah,
 thank
 you
 so


much.
 Really
 appreciate
 your
 insights.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> Thank
 you.
 It
 was
 a
 pleasure.
