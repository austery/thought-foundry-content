Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 OddLots
 podcast.
 I'm
 Joe
 Wisenthal


>> and
 I'm
 Tracy
 Aloway.
 Tracy,
 I
 was
 at
 a


uh
 my
 cousin's
 wedding
 this
 weekend
 and


I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 lawyers
 in
 my
 family


and
 every
 time
 I
 didn't
 know
 that.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 In
 my
 extended
 family,
 a
 lot


of
 lawyers
 in
 there


>> and
 I'm
 always
 asking
 them
 like
 what


they
 do
 and
 stuff.
 Within
 like
 5
 seconds


of
 any
 conversation,
 I'm
 like
 tell
 me


about
 trials
 and
 like
 techniques
 like


sway
 the
 jury
 and
 etc.
 The
 stuff
 I
 see


on
 TV.
 I
 am
 aware
 though
 that
 that
 is


actually
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a
 part
 of
 many


lawyers
 like
 day-to-day.
 Mhm.
 Well,
 uh
 I


have
 a
 lawyer
 in
 my
 family
 too,
 an
 ex-


lawyer,
 uh
 my
 husband,


>> uh
 who
 did
 big
 law,
 big
 corporate
 law,


absolutely
 hated
 it
 and
 got
 out
 of
 it,


um
 luckily.
 And
 so
 I
 have
 a
 feeling
 in


this
 particular
 episode,
 I'm
 just
 going


to
 ask
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 life
 balance


questions
 based
 on
 my
 own
 experience,
 my


husband's
 experience.
 Yeah.
 But
 it
 is
 a


huge
 industry
 and
 it's
 one
 of
 those


industries
 that
 I
 think
 all
 financial


journalism
 actually
 doesn't
 do
 a
 good


job
 of
 covering
 along
 with
 accounting.


So
 we
 should
 talk
 about
 it.


>> We
 definitely
 should
 talk
 about
 it.
 We


should
 talk
 about
 it
 way
 more
 than
 uh
 we


do
 within
 the
 AI
 conversation


specifically.
 You
 hear
 a
 lot
 about
 the


prospects
 of
 this
 being
 either
 like
 a


force
 multiplier
 or
 a
 labor
 reducer


because
 my
 understanding
 is
 that
 a
 lot


of
 like
 especially
 like
 junior
 lawyers,


they're
 up
 all
 night.
 What
 are
 they
 like


looking
 for
 misplaced
 commas?
 Because


those
 could
 be
 a
 big
 deal
 in
 contracts,


right?
 And
 so
 in
 theory,
 and
 again


Tracy,
 I'm
 sure
 you
 know
 way
 more
 about


this
 than
 I
 do,
 but
 in
 theory
 that
 sort


of
 seems
 like
 something
 AI
 might
 be
 good


at
 like,
 oh
 no,
 if
 the
 comma
 is
 not
 here


and
 it's
 there,
 then
 that
 totally


changes
 the
 definition
 of
 this
 clause
 or


whatever.
 There's
 a
 famous
 case


involving
 a
 comma
 that
 did
 exactly
 that.


Um,
 so
 many
 points
 to
 make
 here.
 First


of
 all,
 I
 am
 vastly
 in
 favor
 of
 anything


that
 makes
 corporate
 lawyers
 lives
 uh


slightly
 more
 efficient
 and
 happier.
 So


AI
 could
 be
 useful
 here.
 But
 I
 also


wonder,
 you
 know,
 the
 lawyer
 profession,


they
 have
 things
 like
 templates
 and


standard
 forms
 and
 stuff
 like
 that.
 So
 I


also
 wonder
 how
 much
 of
 an
 improvement


AI
 will
 be
 here.
 So
 I'm
 excited
 to
 talk


about
 it.
 You
 know
 that
 Tracy,
 when
 they


get
 the
 AI
 tools
 really
 in
 place,


they're
 just
 going
 to
 give
 them
 more


work
 because
 they're
 like,
 "Well,
 AI,


>> that's
 what
 I
 suspect."


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 No
 one's
 actually.


>> By
 the
 way,
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 stories
 of


like
 partners
 calling
 from
 their
 fishing


boats
 on
 the
 weekend
 demanding
 that


junior
 lawyers
 go
 into
 the
 office
 and


like
 fix
 a
 comma
 and
 things
 like
 that.


>> All
 right.
 Well,
 I'm
 really
 excited
 to


say
 we
 do
 have
 the
 perfect
 guest,


someone
 that
 I've
 known
 for
 a
 very
 long


time,
 someone
 who
 just
 knows
 about
 a
 lot


of
 stuff,
 someone
 who
 is
 a
 lawyer.
 We


are
 going
 to
 be
 speaking
 with
 Joel


Worerheimer.
 He's
 uh
 currently
 at


Worheimer
 Fleer
 LLP,
 a
 civil
 rights
 uh


firm
 here
 in
 New
 York
 City.
 He
 is


previously
 at
 the
 White
 House.
 He's
 done


big
 law
 in
 the
 past.
 He
 knows
 a
 lot


about
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff.
 He
 knows
 a
 lot


about
 poker.
 He
 knows
 a
 lot
 about
 AI.


Someone
 I
 think
 we
 could
 just
 talk
 to


about
 anything.
 He
 knows
 a
 lot
 about


elections.
 He
 just
 sort
 of
 knows


everything.
 Uh
 Joel,
 thank
 you
 so
 much


for
 coming
 on
 OddLots.
 Thrilled
 to
 have


you
 here.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.
 Um,
 why
 don't


you
 real
 quickly
 tell
 us
 like
 who
 you


are?
 What
 do
 you
 do?
 Why
 are
 we
 talking


to
 you?


>> I
 run
 my
 own
 civil
 rights
 law
 firm.
 I


just
 partnered
 up.
 And
 we
 sue
 the


government
 mostly
 uh
 for
 violations
 of


civil
 rights.
 Sometimes
 that's
 false


arrest
 or
 wrongful
 convictions.
 Uh


sometimes
 that's
 wrongful
 removals
 of
 of


kids
 in
 let's
 say
 child
 services
 for
 a


shaken
 baby.
 That
 was
 a
 false


accusation.
 That
 sort
 of
 thing.
 And
 we


try
 to
 get
 people
 compensation
 for
 the


wrongs
 of
 their
 constitutional
 rights.


That's
 about
 80%
 of
 what
 we
 do.


>> Personal
 question.
 Are
 civil/criminal


lawyers
 are
 they
 happier
 than
 corporate


lawyers?


>> I
 would
 say
 on
 average,
 sure,
 but
 the


distribution
 is
 probably
 pretty
 wide
 for


each,


>> you
 know,
 I
 look,
 I
 do
 think
 on
 the
 the


nice
 thing
 on
 the
 plaintiff
 side
 and
 as


like
 I'm
 my
 own
 boss.
 I
 get
 to,
 you


know,
 determine
 how
 much
 I
 work
 and
 each


extra
 case
 is
 just
 more
 money
 or
 less


money
 if
 I
 if
 I
 decide
 not
 to
 take
 it.


And
 so
 I
 can
 sort
 of
 set
 my
 own
 work


life
 balance
 when
 I
 do
 that,
 you
 know,


and
 I'm
 it's
 it's
 constantly
 a
 decision


of
 sort
 of
 what's
 the
 expected
 value
 of


a
 case
 and
 and
 is
 it
 worth
 it
 to
 me
 in


terms
 of
 the
 hours
 I
 have
 to
 put
 in.


>> So
 let's
 talk
 about
 when
 you
 were
 at
 uh


big
 law
 and
 you
 know
 I
 joked
 that
 you


know
 people
 they're
 up
 at
 1:00
 a.m.
 and


they're
 looking
 at
 commas.
 I
 know
 that's


a
 little
 bit
 of
 an
 exaggeration,
 but
 I


No,
 it's
 not.
 It
 really
 isn't.


>> Yeah,
 I
 guess
 it's
 not.
 And
 I
 know
 that


uh
 lawyers
 are
 really
 obsessed
 with


billable
 hours,
 and
 I
 think
 they
 even


like
 measure
 things
 in
 10-minute


increments,
 like
 so
 six
 minute


increments.


>> If
 you're
 a
 junior
 associate
 or
 you


enter
 a
 law
 firm,
 whatever.
 What
 is
 the


modal
 use
 of
 your
 time?
 What
 are
 you


mostly
 doing
 when
 you're
 clocking
 those


six-minute
 increments?


>> Right.
 So
 it's
 going
 to
 I'm
 I
 can
 only


really
 speak
 to
 litigation
 because
 you


know
 corporate
 you're
 I
 think
 just


reviewing


>> contracts
 and
 deal
 points
 constantly.


For
 litigator


>> a
 lot
 of
 your
 your
 time
 is
 in
 discovery


and
 that's
 true
 small
 law
 big
 law
 but


you
 are
 reviewing
 documents


uh
 synthesizing
 what
 they
 say.
 Maybe


you're
 trying
 to
 do
 a
 privilege
 check


and
 say
 okay
 this
 document
 we
 can't
 turn


over.
 You
 know
 that's
 changed
 some


actually
 with
 machine
 learning.
 The


predictive
 coding
 has
 shrunk
 the
 amount


of
 time
 that
 you
 know
 junior
 associates


are
 spent
 doing
 that.
 Legal
 research


fights
 with
 opposing
 council.
 You
 need


to
 give
 us
 these
 documents.
 You're


saying
 they're
 privileged.
 They're
 not


privileged.
 That
 sort
 of
 thing.


>> And
 then
 there's
 the
 smaller
 section
 on


taking
 depositions,
 you
 know,
 briefing


things
 to
 court.
 So
 that's
 a
 very
 broad


overview
 of
 those
 six
 minute
 increments.


And
 yes,
 editing
 and
 reviewing
 and


looking
 for
 hanging
 commas,
 you
 know,


hanging
 headers.
 That
 was
 always
 the


bane
 of
 my
 existence
 was
 forgetting
 that


there
 was
 a
 hanging
 header
 and
 getting


yelled
 at
 for
 it.


>> That
 sounds
 bad.
 You
 know
 the
 economics


of
 a
 big
 law
 firm.
 It
 feels
 like
 this


very
 big
 pyramid
 structure
 which
 I
 think


is
 replicated
 in
 many
 industries
 around


the
 world
 probably
 in
 finance
 to
 some


extent
 and
 then
 uh
 I
 think
 even
 academia


to
 some
 extent.
 But
 talk
 to
 us
 a
 little


bit
 about
 like
 how
 that
 value
 acrus
 to


the
 entire
 firm
 and
 the
 partners
 and
 the


distribution
 of
 the
 uh
 the
 fees
 that
 the


clients
 are
 paying,


>> right?
 So
 you
 have
 what
 they
 call
 uh


leverage
 in
 a
 law
 firm.
 So
 you
 have


equity
 partners,
 some
 firms
 have
 equity


partners
 and
 income
 partners
 who
 don't


actually
 own
 a
 share
 of
 the
 firm,
 but


the
 partners
 are
 trying
 to
 get
 leverage


on
 the
 associates.
 a
 one
 partner
 to
 say


four
 associate
 ratio.
 All
 of
 the
 big
 law


firms
 uh
 basically
 pay
 the
 exact
 same


amount
 to
 their
 associates.
 This
 is


called
 the
 crevath
 scale.
 If
 you
 you
 can


you
 can
 look
 it
 up
 and
 it'll
 say
 a


thirdyear
 associate
 makes
 $250,000


and
 gets
 this
 bonus
 each
 year.
 Let's


just
 say
 for
 for
 uh
 the
 average


associate
 bills
 $700
 an
 hour
 and
 is


expected
 to
 bill
 about
 2,000
 hours
 a


year.
 So
 they're
 they're
 generating
 1.4


million
 for
 the
 firm
 in
 revenue
 in
 terms


of
 build
 out
 and
 they're
 getting
 paid
 uh


I'd
 say
 with
 taxes
 and
 and
 everything


500,000.
 So
 the
 partners
 are
 making


$900,000
 for
 every
 extra
 associate.
 So


if
 you
 have
 a
 4
 to1
 leverage
 n
 you
 know


uh
 900,000
 profits
 per
 partner
 3.6


million.
 And
 that's
 how
 they're
 trying


to
 think
 of
 it.
 And
 the
 the
 big


partners,
 the
 rain
 makers
 are
 the
 ones


who
 can
 generate
 enough
 work
 to
 support


those
 associates.
 Got
 it.
 Uh
 and
 if
 you


can't
 support
 those
 associates,
 your


leverage
 goes
 down,
 your
 profits
 go


down,
 you
 might
 have
 to
 lay
 people
 off,


that
 sort
 of
 thing.


>> It's
 nice
 to
 be
 a
 partner
 at
 big
 law.


But
 on
 that
 note,
 so
 my
 understanding
 at


least
 in
 corporate
 law
 is
 that
 it
 is


harder
 to
 make
 partner
 nowadays
 than
 it


used
 to
 be.
 And
 this
 is
 part
 of
 the


reason
 why
 it's
 a
 miserable
 experience


because
 it
 used
 to
 be
 in
 the
 past,
 you


know,
 you
 work
 really
 really
 hard,


basically
 give
 up
 your
 life
 for
 like
 two


decades
 or
 whatever
 and
 then
 you
 get


rewarded
 with
 a
 huge
 salary
 and
 you


don't
 have
 to
 do
 as
 much
 of
 the
 grunt


work.
 Your
 job
 is
 basically
 sourcing


deals
 and
 making
 the
 intros
 and
 stuff


like
 that.
 Do
 you
 get
 that
 impression
 as


well
 on
 your
 side?


>> I
 definitely
 see
 from
 the
 outside
 that


it
 seems
 harder
 to
 make
 partner.
 I
 think


that's
 led
 to
 people
 more
 people
 leaving


earlier
 to
 do
 their
 own
 firms.
 I
 think


it's
 easier
 than
 ever
 to
 start
 your
 own


firm.
 And
 so


>> why
 is
 that?


>> I
 mean,
 for
 one,
 I
 mean,
 for
 me,
 for


example,
 I
 didn't
 need
 an
 office
 when
 I


started.
 I
 started
 in
 January
 of
 2021.
 I


had
 a
 desk
 at
 a,
 you
 know,
 at
 another


law
 firm
 that
 collected
 mail.
 I
 think


the
 number
 of
 services
 are
 just
 easier


to
 access.
 even
 things
 like
 you
 know
 now


if
 you
 really
 wanted
 to
 like
 cut
 you


could
 start
 with
 a
 cheaper
 uh
 legal


research
 service
 than
 than
 Weslaw
 things


like
 that
 I
 think
 and
 you've
 seen
 it
 in


the
 in
 the
 business
 creation
 numbers
 I


think
 you
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 professional


services
 you
 know
 splitting
 off
 from


firms
 but
 I
 definitely
 think
 it's
 harder


to
 make
 partner
 they
 have
 had
 that


they've
 added
 this
 income
 partner
 level


so
 you
 make
 partner
 but
 you're
 not
 an


equity
 member
 of
 the
 firm
 um
 I
 think


>> consolation
 prize


>> that's
 right
 and
 and
 you
 get
 to
 shop
 the


title
 I
 think
 is
 the
 other
 reason
 you


know
 so
 let's
 say
 you
 want
 to
 go


in-house
 somewhere
 now
 you're
 a
 partner


at
 this
 firm
 and
 you
 can
 say
 you're
 a


partner
 at
 the
 firm
 even
 if
 you
 haven't


bought
 in
 but
 I
 think
 that
 structure
 has


been
 around
 longer
 honestly
 it
 feels


like
 the
 same
 thing
 it's
 in
 academia


it's
 harder
 to
 get
 tenure
 now
 it's
 a
 it


just
 the the
 ladder's
 getting
 pulled
 up


I
 guess
 in
 in
 these
 sort
 of
 industries


[Music]


would
 anyone
 go
 into
 a
 big
 law
 firm
 if


they
 knew
 in
 advance
 that
 they
 wouldn't


make
 partner
 like
 there's
 so
 like
 the


angel
 of
 the
 future
 comes
 to
 them
 in
 a


dream
 and
 says
 you
 know what
 you're
 not


going
 to
 make
 partner
 would
 that
 still


be
 worthwhile
 or
 is
 the
 prospect
 even
 if


it's
 declining
 of
 making
 partner
 like
 is


that
 crucial
 towards
 that
 decision
 if


you
 knew
 in
 advance
 you
 weren't
 going
 to


make
 it
 would
 anyone
 make
 that
 decision


>> so
 they
 do
 have
 staff
 attorneys
 at
 big


law
 firms
 that
 are
 people
 who
 are
 not
 on


partner
 track


>> okay


>> and


>> and
 those
 are
 fine
 careers


>> and
 they're
 fine
 careers
 I
 think
 people


you
 know
 but
 they
 also
 have
 less


expectation
 of
 how
 much
 they're
 going
 to


to
 work.
 You
 typically
 wouldn't
 do
 it.


And
 the
 reason
 they
 have
 this
 upper
 out


sort
 of
 system
 at
 the
 big
 law
 firms
 uh


is
 because
 the
 prospect
 of
 being
 partner


drives
 you
 to
 2,2500
 hours
 how
 many
 it


is.
 You're
 showing
 how


>> the
 light
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 tunnel,


right?


>> That's
 right.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I
 think


look,
 the
 training
 is
 really
 good.
 The


cases
 are
 really
 interesting.
 like
 I
 I


actually
 quite
 enjoyed
 some
 of
 it,
 but


that
 pressure
 to
 to
 bill
 and
 work
 is
 is


you
 probably
 wouldn't
 want
 that


>> when
 you
 say
 training
 like
 you
 know
 I


don't
 like
 what's
 the
 deal
 like
 in
 law


school
 you
 don't
 even
 learn
 about
 any
 of


the
 things
 you
 actually
 do
 as
 a
 lawyer


>> you
 you
 certainly
 learn
 you
 know
 how
 to


think
 about
 the
 law
 but
 you're
 not


learning
 in
 the
 and
 you
 have
 a
 legal


>> I
 think
 this
 is
 actually
 important
 for


the
 AI
 component
 of
 like
 okay
 what
 is


how
 do
 you
 actually
 learn
 to
 be
 a
 lawyer


if
 you
 don't
 really
 do
 it
 in
 law
 school


and
 then
 you
 know
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 take


over
 more
 and
 more
 of
 these
 functions


like
 the
 pro
 where
 do
 you
 learn
 right


>> so
 what
 is
 the
 learning


>> so
 here's
 an
 example
 you
 don't
 learn
 how


to
 have
 uh
 a
 dispute
 about
 discovery
 in


law
 school
 okay
 you
 know
 I
 I
 sent
 out


discovery
 demands
 you
 owe
 me
 documents


right
 under
 in
 the
 American
 system
 of


law
 somebody
 you
 get
 you
 end
 up
 in
 a


lawsuit
 and
 each
 side
 is
 obligated
 to


exchange
 documents
 with
 each
 other
 and


you
 you
 send
 out
 demands
 and
 and
 you
 ask


for
 a
 certain
 category
 of
 documents
 and


they
 come
 back
 and
 say,
 "We're
 not
 going


to
 give
 them
 to
 you.
 That
 request
 was


overly
 burdensome
 or
 they're
 not


relevant


>> or
 they
 say
 they
 lost
 them


>> or
 they
 say
 they
 they
 lost
 them."
 And


you
 have
 to
 have
 a
 fight
 about
 getting


the
 documents,
 what
 keys,
 what
 keywords


did
 you
 search,
 who
 did
 you
 collect


documents
 from,
 all
 of
 those
 sorts
 of


things.
 And
 how
 to
 have
 that
 dispute,


how
 to
 make
 the
 request
 so
 you
 don't
 get


the
 the
 denial,
 those
 sorts
 of
 things.


and
 what
 the
 writing
 looks
 like
 and


feels
 like
 you
 just
 don't
 get
 in
 in
 law


school.
 You
 just
 the
 and
 and
 even


writing
 a
 brief
 and
 what's
 a
 persuasive


brief
 you
 the
 edits
 those
 sorts
 of


things
 you
 you
 learn
 how
 to
 do
 legal


writing
 but
 it's
 just
 you
 can't
 do
 it


until
 you're
 doing
 it.


>> Got
 it.


>> Okay.
 So
 on
 that
 note,
 I
 mean
 AI
 seems


possibly
 most
 at
 home
 replicating
 the


work
 done
 by
 say
 a
 mildly
 competent


maybe
 not
 too
 tired
 junior
 associate
 and


historically
 you
 do
 that
 work
 for
 many


years
 and
 you
 build
 foundational
 skills


of
 being
 a
 lawyer
 like
 attention
 to


detail
 and
 issue
 spotting
 and
 I
 guess


risk
 triage
 and
 that
 sort
 of
 thing.
 If


those
 tasks,
 those
 formational
 tasks
 are


now
 outsourced
 to
 AI,
 what
 do
 you
 see
 as


the
 impact
 on
 junior
 lawyers?


>> It's
 a
 great
 question.
 I
 think
 it's


going
 to
 be
 hard
 for
 junior
 lawyers
 at


big
 law
 firms
 uh
 to
 get
 their
 their
 sort


of
 that
 training.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 it


may
 just
 be
 that
 they
 are
 doing
 more


work
 and
 so
 on
 the
 same
 things
 but
 more


efficiently.
 Maybe
 they're
 they're
 now


going
 to
 have
 more
 uh
 fights
 about


documents
 uh
 and
 less
 time
 spending


reviewing
 the
 documents.
 Maybe
 they
 can


increase
 the
 volume
 of
 things
 they


demand,
 that
 sort
 of
 thing.
 I
 certainly


think
 that
 the
 the
 leverage
 model
 is
 and


the
 build
 our
 model
 is
 going
 to
 run
 into


some
 difficulty.
 It'll
 also
 make
 their


lives
 easier
 just
 in
 terms
 of,
 you
 know,


as
 an
 example,
 you
 get
 discovery


requests.
 I
 talk
 about
 discovery
 a
 lot


because
 it's
 truly
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 the


work
 of
 being
 a
 lawyer.
 But
 they
 come,


you
 know,
 the
 other
 side
 will
 send
 you
 a


PDF
 with
 a
 bunch
 of
 demands
 and
 then


you've
 got
 to
 respond
 to
 the
 demands.


And
 even
 just
 the
 the
 moment
 where
 you


have
 to
 convert
 the
 PDF
 into
 a
 word


document
 and
 start
 editing
 the
 work
 word


document
 is
 like
 the
 true
 bane
 of
 my


existence.
 And
 I've
 actually
 started


using
 this
 AI
 program.
 It's
 called


briefpoint
 AI


>> and
 and
 they
 it's
 also
 very
 templated,


right?
 So
 you're
 constantly
 trying
 to


find
 templates.
 Hey,
 other
 associate
 in


this
 law
 firm,
 can
 you
 send
 me,
 you


know,
 a
 previous
 document
 now?
 I
 can


they
 have,
 you
 know,
 80
 different


objections
 that
 you're
 used
 to
 making


and
 they
 convert
 them
 and
 it's
 a
 lot


more
 point-and-click.
 And
 of
 course,
 you


have
 to
 know
 what
 you're
 doing
 when


you're,
 you
 know,
 that
 these
 objections


are
 valid,
 but
 just
 the
 document


formatting
 and
 getting
 it
 through,
 you


know,
 and
 it
 look
 to
 to
 look
 good
 and


and
 not
 have
 to
 fight
 with
 Microsoft


Word
 for
 3
 hours
 is
 really
 valuable.


>> I
 realize
 I
 should
 have
 asked
 this


earlier,
 but
 when
 we
 say
 AI,
 what
 does


that
 actually
 entail
 in
 the
 legal
 field?


Because
 as
 you
 point
 out,
 I
 mean,


templates,
 standard
 forms,
 those
 sort
 of


things
 have
 been
 around
 forever
 and
 a


lot
 of
 law
 firms
 already
 use
 template


software
 to
 quickly
 duplicate
 work
 or


make
 document
 packages
 or
 whatever.
 So,


when
 we
 talk
 about
 AI
 in
 law,
 what


exactly
 would
 that
 be?


>> I
 think
 it
 can
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 things.
 One,


it
 can
 be
 making
 that
 template
 process
 a


lot
 faster
 and
 uh,
 you
 know,
 that
 will


free
 up
 labor
 time
 for
 sure.
 the
 you


know
 JT
 GPT's
 03
 Pro
 is
 doing
 legal


research
 now
 that
 is
 quite
 excellent


>> this
 is
 really
 important
 people
 who


think
 that
 this
 that
 03
 is
 dumb
 or
 is
 a


hallucination
 machine
 are
 not
 or
 that


CHBT
 is
 have
 not
 used
 03


>> that's
 that's
 my
 view
 and
 you
 know


there's
 this
 professor
 at
 uh
 Georgetown


I
 think
 his
 uh
 name
 is
 Danny
 Wiltown


who's
 just
 sort
 of
 every
 time
 a
 new


model
 has
 been
 coming
 out
 has
 been


running
 sort
 of
 exam
 questions
 that
 he


gives
 to
 his
 students.
 I
 think
 it's
 in


his
 federal
 courts
 class
 about,
 you


know,
 how
 how
 they
 do
 on
 each
 of
 these


questions.
 And
 when
 03
 came
 out,
 not


even
 03
 pro,
 when
 03
 came
 out,
 it
 was
 uh


it
 it
 answered
 them
 all,
 some
 of
 them


excellently,
 and
 even
 got
 what
 he
 it
 was


it's
 called
 an
 issue
 spotter
 question.


So,
 it
 wasn't
 on
 the
 face
 of
 the


question.
 It
 was
 an
 appellet


jurisdiction
 question.
 If
 you
 really


were
 thinking
 hard
 about
 it
 as
 a


student,
 you
 would
 have
 noticed
 this


issue
 that
 he
 wasn't
 asking
 about


explicitly,
 but
 there
 might
 not
 have


been
 jurisdiction
 to
 even
 bring
 the


appeal
 that
 he
 prompted
 you
 about.
 And


03
 caught
 that.
 And
 when
 I've
 used
 it,


you
 know,
 you
 hear
 a
 lot
 of these
 cases,


you
 lawyers
 getting
 sanctioned
 because


they're,
 you
 know,
 submitting
 things


with
 hallucinated
 cases.
 And


>> there's
 some
 funny
 examples
 of
 that.


>> They're
 they're
 amazing.
 And
 the
 thing
 I


think
 to
 myself
 is
 you
 would
 never


submit
 as
 a
 as
 a
 partner
 at
 a
 law
 firm.


You'd
 never
 submit
 whatever
 the
 junior


associate
 just
 turned
 over
 to
 you.


Sometimes
 they
 didn't
 understand
 the


case
 exactly
 right.
 And
 so
 you're
 that's


the
 job
 is
 is
 checking
 the
 cases.


Shepherizing
 is
 the
 is
 the
 I
 think
 the


Lexus
 term
 for
 it.
 And
 and
 making
 sure


the
 cases
 stand
 for
 what
 they
 say
 that


there's
 still
 valid
 precedent.
 That's


the
 job
 of
 being
 a
 lawyer.
 And
 now
 I
 can


rely
 on
 03
 to
 start
 some
 of
 the
 research


for
 me.
 Fi
 point
 me
 even
 just
 to
 point


me
 to
 the
 cases
 and
 it's
 citing
 to
 the


cases.
 And
 this
 is
 without
 access
 to


Bloomberg
 Law
 or
 or
 Thompson
 Reuters
 or


anything
 like
 that.
 I
 assume
 it's
 coming


and
 and
 once
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 integrated


with
 those
 databases
 of
 cases.
 Right
 now


it's
 just
 trollling
 the
 the
 internet.
 Um


I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 do
 a
 fantastic


job.
 And
 you
 spend
 so
 much
 time
 as
 a


lawyer,
 as
 a
 litigator,
 thinking
 of
 the


boolean
 search
 terms
 for
 Lexus,
 the
 and


or
 these
 sorts
 of
 things
 and
 and
 you


don't
 know
 the
 exact
 term
 that's
 going


to
 come
 up
 in
 the
 case.
 You
 know
 what


the
 all
 of
 the
 president
 use
 this
 term?


Uh
 and


>> not
 having
 to
 think
 about
 that.
 I
 can


run
 it
 in
 the
 background
 as
 I'm
 doing


another
 task
 and
 for
 20
 minutes
 and


something
 comes
 back
 from
 03,
 it's
 got


the
 five
 cases
 that
 I
 need
 to
 to
 dig
 in


and
 find
 the
 the
 right,


>> you
 know,
 language
 to
 then
 go
 on
 Lexus


and
 then
 to
 to
 chase
 it
 down.


>> I've
 been
 using
 03
 more
 for
 just
 sort
 of


my
 own
 like
 intellectual
 questions
 from


time
 to
 time.


>> Your
 own
 lawsuits?
 No,
 I
 haven't
 uh
 done


any
 uh
 I
 haven't
 started
 any
 lawsuits


yet,
 but
 this
 is
 really
 the
 way
 that


I've
 been
 using
 it,
 which
 is
 that
 it's
 a


fantastic
 tool
 for
 just
 like
 discovering


the
 re
 the
 existing
 research
 that's
 out


there.
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 something
 I
 was


curious
 about
 like
 trade
 barriers
 within


China
 between
 provinces,
 you
 know,


something
 like
 that.
 There
 is
 a
 lot
 of


research
 that's
 been
 done
 on
 the


question
 of
 like,
 okay,
 if
 each
 of
 these


provinces
 has
 some
 motivation
 to
 promote


their
 champions,
 is
 there
 any
 tension?


There's
 something
 I
 would
 have
 it
 found


all
 of
 this
 uh
 all
 it it
 had
 the
 links


to
 the
 academic
 research
 that's
 been


about
 it.
 It
 had
 summaries
 of
 them.
 The


summaries
 may
 have
 been
 wrong,
 but
 I'm


not
 in
 the
 pos
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 like


copy
 and
 paste
 summaries
 and
 present
 it


as
 my
 work.
 I
 could
 click
 on
 it
 most
 of


the
 time.
 It
 is
 they
 are
 pretty
 correct.


>> It's
 so
 what
 you
 say
 in
 terms
 of
 like


just
 even
 like
 being
 able
 to
 find
 the


relevant
 case
 law
 etc.
 seems
 extremely


powerful
 and
 time-saving.
 It's
 truly


been
 life-changing
 for
 me.
 I
 and
 and
 I


like
 doing
 legal
 research.
 I
 like


getting
 into
 the
 cases,
 but
 just,
 you


know,
 if
 there's
 a
 new
 issue
 and
 and
 you


just
 don't
 know
 where
 to
 start,


>> you
 know,
 that's
 that
 was
 always,
 I


think,
 for
 a
 junior
 associate,
 where
 do


I
 start?
 And
 I
 think
 it
 will
 make
 their


life
 easier
 in
 that
 regard,
 even
 if
 it


might
 also
 make
 their
 lives,
 you
 know,


hard.


[Music]


Okay.
 Uh,
 timesaving,
 making
 associates


lives
 easier.
 That
 sounds
 great.
 Um,


from
 a
 personal
 perspective,
 but
 what


does
 that
 actually
 mean
 for
 billable


hours?
 Because
 of
 course,
 the
 whole


business
 model
 seems
 to
 rely
 on
 eking


out
 as
 much
 work,
 as
 many
 billable
 hours


as
 possible,
 right?
 And
 that
 includes


grunt
 work,
 which
 theoretically
 could
 be


done
 by
 AI
 now.
 And
 I'm
 not
 sure
 big
 law


or
 any
 law
 is
 going
 to
 be
 necessarily


incentivized
 to
 uh
 to
 use
 AI
 if
 it
 means


a
 reduction
 in
 billable
 hours.
 I
 suppose


they
 could
 make
 it
 up
 in
 volume.
 Maybe


that's
 that's
 the
 idea.
 They
 can
 take
 on


more
 cases.
 But
 is
 is
 that
 the


expectation?


>> They
 might
 be
 able
 to
 make
 it
 up
 in


volume.
 I
 do
 think
 things
 like
 they
 call


them,
 you
 know,
 ultim
 al alternate
 fee


arrangements
 are
 going
 to
 become
 more


popular.
 we
 get
 a
 flat
 fee
 of,
 let's


say,
 $5
 million
 to
 do
 this
 deal
 for
 you


or
 something
 like
 that.


>> And
 then
 you're
 incentivized
 to
 do
 it
 in


the
 fewest
 hours
 possible.
 That's
 right.


Keep
 going.


>> Um,
 so
 so
 that's
 one
 possibility
 that


the
 the
 model
 just
 changes.
 The
 billable


hour,
 it
 stops
 being
 the
 model.
 The


other
 thing
 is,
 you
 know,
 the
 way
 it


works
 right
 now
 is
 I
 it's
 been
 a
 while


for
 me.
 So,
 you
 know,
 the
 big
 partners,


let's
 say
 they're
 they're
 billing
 out
 at


$2,000
 an
 hour
 or
 $1,500
 an
 hour
 and
 and


the
 associates
 are
 $700
 an
 hour.
 I
 think


in
 a
 lot
 of
 ways
 what
 the
 client
 is


paying
 for
 is
 the
 is
 really
 like
 $5,000


an
 hour
 for
 the
 partner
 and
 and
 400
 or


300
 for
 the
 associate
 and
 but
 it
 just


gets
 build
 out
 se
 differently


>> and
 I
 think
 one
 thing
 is
 that
 partners


might
 just
 acrue
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 the
 value


with
 fewer
 associates
 they
 still
 have


the
 build
 hours
 they're
 just
 a
 lot
 more


efficient
 and
 you
 know
 in
 particular
 I


think
 for
 general
 councils
 who
 are


hiring
 at
 The
 big
 law
 firms,
 they're


hiring
 for
 safety.
 You
 know,
 nobody
 ever


got
 fired
 for
 hiring
 Crevath.
 It's
 sort


of
 like
 a
 way
 to
 to
 think
 about
 this
 or


a
 big
 law
 firm.
 If
 something
 goes
 wrong,


you
 want
 to
 have
 hired
 the
 best
 lawyer


you
 could
 and
 say
 to
 your
 board
 or
 your


CEO,
 look,
 I
 hired
 a
 great
 law
 firm
 and


and
 they
 just
 they
 just
 missed
 it,
 but


look,
 this
 is
 everybody
 agrees
 this
 is
 a


great
 law
 firm.
 Which
 is
 all
 to
 just
 say


that
 I
 think
 one
 possibility
 here
 is
 the


build
 hour
 remains
 but
 all
 the
 value


acrru
 to
 the
 to
 the
 the
 top
 top
 lawyers.


>> I
 mean
 that
 seems
 like
 it'll
 have


implications.
 We
 should
 talk
 about
 that


further.
 Something
 I
 have
 done
 is
 I'll


take
 episodes
 transcripts
 of
 oddlot
 and


afterwards
 I'll
 do
 a
 little


self-criticism
 session
 where
 I'll
 like


say
 like
 where
 could
 we
 have
 pressed


this?
 Uh
 where
 were
 the
 weaknesses
 in


the
 guest's
 answer?
 where
 should
 we
 have


pressed
 further
 and
 harder?
 What
 were


some
 of
 the
 logical
 flaws?
 What
 would


you
 have
 done
 differently,
 etc.
 And


sometimes
 I
 found
 that
 to
 be
 useful.


Have
 you
 been
 able
 to
 use
 AI
 for


essentially
 like
 building
 better


arguments
 or
 finding
 weaknesses
 in
 an


argument
 or
 anything
 like
 that
 yet?


>> I
 haven't
 done
 that
 yet.
 I'm
 sure
 I


will.
 I
 have
 used
 it
 for
 taking
 audio


and
 making
 it
 into
 transcripts.
 I
 mean,


that's
 just
 like
 a
 foundational
 thing


for
 me.
 Yeah,
 prison
 will
 produce
 an


audio
 of


>> a
 hearing
 or
 something
 like
 that
 and
 I


need
 the
 transcript
 and
 I
 need
 to
 like


just
 read
 it
 instead
 of
 listening
 to
 it


for
 40
 minutes.
 But
 self-criticism,


>> but
 yeah,
 but
 it
 also
 it
 does
 sound
 like


you
 mentioned
 the
 issue
 spotter
 question


like
 like
 actually
 being
 able
 to


identify
 real
 legal
 questions,


>> not
 just
 identify
 precedent.


>> Yeah.
 Not
 just
 identify
 precedent,
 but


actually
 logical
 sequences
 or
 where
 like


it
 sounds
 like
 that's
 where
 you're


getting
 at.
 I'm
 sure
 it
 is
 coming
 and
 I


think
 as
 I
 um
 you
 know
 get
 as
 as
 the


models
 get
 better
 and
 I
 have
 to
 produce


a
 brief
 and
 and
 maybe
 I
 can
 start


running
 it
 through.
 Of
 course
 lawyers


all
 have
 huge
 confidentiality
 concerns


with
 everything
 they
 do.
 So
 I'm
 very


careful
 about
 what
 I'm
 putting
 into
 GPT


u
 you
 know
 and


>> you
 got
 to
 run
 your
 own
 DeepSk
 instance.


I
 think
 that
 that's
 right.
 And
 I
 think


the
 big
 law
 firms
 are
 having
 sort
 of


servers
 on
 site
 with
 their
 own
 models,


but
 those
 models
 aren't
 as
 good
 as
 03


yet.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 as
 you
 can
 start
 to


have
 great
 models
 inhouse
 on
 your
 own


servers,
 that's
 going
 to
 really
 be
 the


the
 thing
 that
 that
 launches
 it.
 I
 can't


do
 that
 cuz
 it's
 just
 me
 and
 and
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 host
 a
 server
 farm.
 But
 I
 do


know
 right
 the
 new
 Apple
 chips
 on
 these


very
 nice
 the
 newest
 they
 can
 run
 you


know
 things
 like
 llama
 very
 well
 and
 so


it's
 coming.
 Uh
 but
 but
 I
 think
 for
 the


top
 models
 I'm
 sort
 of
 reluctant
 to
 put


everything
 up
 there.


>> That
 makes
 sense.


>> This
 is
 exactly
 what
 I
 was
 going
 to
 ask


next
 which
 is
 how
 do
 clients
 feel
 about


AI
 in
 the
 legal
 industry?
 Because
 I


imagine,
 you
 know,
 nobody
 ever
 got
 fired


for
 hiring
 Crevath,
 as
 you
 mentioned,
 or


some
 other
 magic
 circle
 law
 firm.
 But
 on


the
 other
 hand,
 if
 Kvath
 is
 now
 using


AI,
 I
 imagine
 on
 the
 client
 side,
 maybe


there's
 some
 concern
 over
 having
 their


material
 contracts
 or
 employee
 data
 or


financing
 documents
 or
 whatever
 getting


uploaded
 to
 off-site
 servers.
 And
 then


there's
 also
 the
 question
 of
 what
 if
 AI


just
 makes
 a
 mistake?
 Although
 as
 you


pointed
 out,
 no
 partner
 would
 ever


submit
 something
 um
 done
 by
 a
 junior


associate
 without
 actually
 reviewing
 it


first.
 So
 maybe
 that's
 not
 as
 much
 of
 an


issue.
 But
 are
 there
 any
 um
 qualms
 I


guess
 coming
 from
 the
 client
 side
 that


you
 see?
 So
 I
 I
 can't
 speak
 to
 the
 big


law
 as
 much
 anymore
 and
 it's
 it's
 very


different
 I
 think
 on
 my
 side
 and
 I
 think


you
 know
 my
 my
 clients
 are
 their
 qualms


are
 are
 much
 sort
 of
 bigger
 in
 terms
 of


privacy
 and
 and
 much
 more
 you
 know


focused
 on
 on
 the
 government
 and
 and
 are


wanting
 to
 get
 just
 the
 best


representation
 they
 can.
 So
 but
 for


example
 I'm
 getting
 medical
 records
 from


my
 clients
 a
 lot.
 That's
 a
 lot
 of
 the


job
 of
 a
 plaintiff
 side
 lawyer
 is


documenting
 injuries,
 thing
 like
 things


like
 that.
 And
 they're
 certainly


concerned
 about
 their
 medical
 privacy.


And
 so
 I
 can't,
 you
 know,
 use
 AI
 yet
 to


to
 take
 the
 medical
 records
 and
 condense


them
 into,
 you
 know,
 the
 quick


summaries.
 Um,


>> but
 those
 programs
 I'm
 sure
 are
 coming


where,
 you
 know,
 you
 have
 there's


there's
 privacy
 and
 security
 and
 all
 of


the
 things.
 They
 probably
 exist
 already.


I'm
 just
 not
 using
 them
 yet
 to
 make
 that


part
 feasible.
 Um,
 I
 am
 sure
 that
 you


know
 if
 you
 are
 Goldman
 Sachs
 and
 you


hire
 a
 big
 law
 firm
 and
 they've
 been


doing
 your
 your
 deals
 or
 your
 IPOs
 such


as
 they
 exist
 right
 now
 and
 you
 don't


want
 the
 the
 law
 firm
 training
 on
 your


documents
 to
 go
 use
 them
 in
 in
 other


deals,
 I'm
 sure
 this
 is
 an
 an
 issue.
 On


the
 other
 hand,
 you
 know,
 it
 might


reduce
 your
 legal
 costs
 by
 by
 half
 and


you
 can
 fight
 about
 that.
 And
 so,
 you


know,
 what
 they're
 willing
 to
 do,
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 know.
 Let's
 extend
 forth


some
 of
 these
 economic
 questions
 because


allowing
 the
 senior
 partners
 to
 acrue


more
 value
 by
 not
 needing
 to
 allocate
 as


many
 hours
 to
 the
 junior
 lawyers
 that


makes
 total
 sense
 for
 this
 specific


generation,
 right?
 Because
 okay,
 some


people
 are
 lucky
 enough
 to
 have
 made


partner
 before
 AI
 and
 then
 other
 people


are
 going
 to
 be
 in
 this
 situation
 which


their
 value
 maybe
 uh
 you
 know
 could
 be


done
 more
 cheaply
 or
 for
 a
 few
 hours
 but


10
 years
 from
 now
 whatever
 a
 lot
 of


those
 partners
 are
 going
 to
 be
 retired.


etc.
 Like
 what
 is
 the
 downstream


consequence
 of
 your
 view
 in
 your
 view
 of


some
 of
 these
 shifts
 that
 are
 happen


right
 now
 because
 you
 know
 eventually


all
 the
 partners
 you
 know
 eventually


everyone's
 going
 to
 die
 and
 there's


going to
 be
 new
 like
 where
 does
 this
 go


like
 what's
 the
 next
 what
 are
 the


consequences


>> so
 I
 think
 that
 uh
 the
 skills
 that
 will


be
 valued
 in
 lawyers
 are
 just
 going
 to


change
 a
 lot
 the
 interpersonal
 skills
 of


client
 management
 walking
 your
 client


through
 the
 risks
 that
 they
 have
 they're


nervous
 they're
 getting
 sued.
 These
 are


bet
 the
 company
 litigations.
 The
 lawyers


who
 can
 make
 them
 feel
 safe
 and
 let
 them


understand
 what's
 happening
 to
 them
 and


what
 their
 odds
 are.
 Those
 sorts
 of


things.
 The
 lawyers
 who
 are
 great
 at


taking
 depositions
 and
 the
 lawyers
 who


are
 great
 at
 oral
 argument,
 those
 skills


are
 going
 to
 go
 up
 and
 up,
 I
 think,
 in


skill
 uh
 in
 in
 value.
 and
 the
 scale
 of


legal
 research
 or
 just
 being
 great
 at


writing
 a
 brief.
 I
 do
 think
 that
 that's


going
 to
 get
 maybe
 not
 the
 99th


percentile
 brief
 writing,
 the
 people
 who


are
 going
 to
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 and
 who


are
 just
 truly
 excellent.
 Maybe
 that


will
 take
 time,
 but
 the
 sort
 of
 grunt


work,
 you
 know,
 solid
 junior
 associate,


mid-level
 associate,
 senior
 associate


who
 are
 writing
 the
 briefs
 that
 I
 I


question
 whether
 that
 skill
 will
 have


the
 same
 value.
 But
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


interpersonal


skill
 that
 matters
 a
 lot
 for
 for
 being
 a


lawyer
 and
 that's
 going
 to
 go
 up
 in


value.


>> Now
 the
 question
 with
 any
 new
 technology


is
 does
 it
 cuz
 one
 argument
 is
 clear


okay
 there's
 an
 x
 amount
 of
 demand
 for


legal
 services
 and
 there's
 an
 x
 amount


of
 people
 who
 supply
 them
 and
 maybe
 you


you
 save
 you
 save
 some
 money.
 Could
 the


market
 for
 legal
 services
 grow
 such
 that


if
 capacity
 to
 do
 legal
 research
 and


some
 of
 this
 other
 stuff
 gets
 cheaper


that
 there
 are
 more
 areas
 it's
 like
 oh


you
 know what
 maybe
 this
 is
 worth
 filing


a
 lawsuit
 everywhere.
 This
 was
 actually


going
 to
 be
 my
 my
 question
 as
 well
 but


particularly
 for
 poor
 plaintiffs
 who


normally
 can't
 afford
 a
 lawyer.
 What
 did


they
 call
 them?
 In


>> indigent
 and
 they
 sometimes
 will
 file


prosay
 on
 their
 own
 behalf


>> or
 maybe
 more
 lawyers
 like
 you
 take
 on


cases
 take
 other
 cases
 that
 in
 five


years
 ago
 the
 economics
 wouldn't
 have


made
 sense
 but
 today
 the
 economics
 made


sense
 like
 could
 it
 just
 be
 you
 know


Jevans
 paradox
 but
 for
 law.
 I
 think


that's
 absolutely
 going
 to
 happen.
 You


know
 I
 can
 just
 sort
 of
 walk
 through
 the


economics
 of
 one
 of
 my
 cases.
 you
 know,


somebody
 comes
 in
 and
 they
 say
 they
 they


had
 a
 false
 arrest
 case
 against
 the
 the


NYPD
 and
 they
 spent,
 let's
 say,
 5
 hours


in
 custody.
 We
 sort
 of
 know
 what
 the


expected
 value
 of
 that
 case
 is.
 You


know,
 you're
 doing
 what
 chance
 are
 you


do
 you
 have
 to
 win
 and
 what
 are
 the


damages
 you
 are
 going
 to
 get
 when
 you


win
 and
 I
 can
 sort
 of
 and
 then
 I
 I
 a


contingency
 fee
 typically
 a
 third
 in
 in


New
 York.
 And
 you
 can
 sort
 of
 do
 that


math
 of
 the
 expected
 value
 of
 the
 case


and
 then
 think
 about
 how
 many
 hours
 it's


going
 to
 take
 to
 to
 win
 that
 case
 or
 get


to
 a
 settlement.


>> And
 if
 I'm
 using
 AI
 to
 make
 myself
 more


productive
 in
 my
 research,
 the
 number
 of


hours
 that
 I'm
 expecting
 to
 put
 into


that
 case
 goes
 down.
 Suddenly
 my
 hurdle


rate
 of
 for,
 you
 know,
 what
 it
 takes
 to


to
 take
 on
 that
 case
 has
 gone
 down
 and
 I


can
 take
 on
 more
 cases
 for
 the
 same


number
 of
 hours.


>> And
 so
 that
 I
 definitely
 think
 is


coming.
 It's
 also
 the
 case
 that
 right


and
 because
 of
 that
 because
 lawyers
 have


to
 think
 in
 that
 term
 of
 you
 know
 how


much
 is
 it
 going
 to
 cost
 me
 to
 do
 this


case
 in
 terms
 of
 labor
 there
 are
 a
 lot


of
 cases
 brought
 prosay
 uh
 in
 in
 the


court
 system
 right
 now
 I
 think
 it's
 like


20
 25%
 of
 cases
 are
 from
 prosay


litigants


>> these
 are the
 people
 represent


themselves


>> who
 represent
 themselves
 because
 they


can't
 afford
 a
 lawyer
 or
 you
 know
 my


cases
 are
 contingency
 people
 are
 paying


out
 of
 pocket
 but
 so
 I
 can't
 afford
 to


take
 on
 the
 case
 because
 the
 damages


aren't
 potentially
 high
 enough
 that's


how
 I
 have
 to
 sort
 of
 think
 about
 it.


And
 so
 I
 think
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot


more
 representation
 of
 those
 people.


It's
 also
 the
 case
 probably
 that
 prosay


lawyers
 are
 going
 to
 start
 getting


better
 that
 you
 know
 uh
 you
 said
 you


were
 doing
 research
 on
 your
 own
 you
 know


with
 03.
 It's
 possible
 that
 you
 know
 if


if
 it
 was
 just
 a
 little
 dispute
 with


somebody
 over
 some
 amount
 of
 money
 you


might
 think
 I
 can
 do
 this
 myself
 rather


than
 trying
 to
 go
 find
 a
 lawyer.
 And
 so,


you
 know,
 but
 for
 legal
 aid,
 for
 people


who
 are
 criminal
 defense
 attorneys
 at


legal
 aid,
 those
 attorneys,
 I
 think,
 are


about
 to
 go
 on
 because
 of
 how
 overworked


they
 are
 and
 underpaid
 they
 are,
 they


they
 might
 get
 a
 lot
 more
 efficient
 and


be
 able
 to
 represent
 a
 lot
 more
 people.


>> Tracy,
 I'm
 imagining
 a
 lot
 of
 very


annoyed
 judges
 by
 like
 prosay


>> frivolous
 lawsuit.
 No,
 I
 mean,
 no,
 I


mean
 like
 someone
 who
 did
 their
 own


research
 cuz
 nothing's
 more
 annoying


than
 someone
 who
 does
 their
 own
 research


and
 then
 they're
 like
 they're
 like


citing
 all
 these
 cases
 that
 they
 learned


about
 yesterday
 and
 stuff
 like
 that.


Like
 it
 just
 seems
 like
 you
 have
 a
 high


potential
 for
 obnoxious
 obnoxious
 people


who
 think
 they
 know.


>> No,
 no,
 no.
 You're
 democratizing
 case


law.
 That's
 what
 I
 say.


>> I
 want
 to
 be
 clear.
 They're
 already


getting
 that.
 The
 the
 judges
 are
 getting


a
 lot
 of
 it.
 especi
 pro,
 you
 know,


prosay
 prisoners
 who
 get
 to
 spend
 a
 lot


of
 time


>> in
 the
 legal
 librarian
 and
 are
 filing


cases
 and
 some
 of
 them
 are
 are
 excellent


and
 and
 but
 sometimes
 they're
 they're


not
 so
 good.
 I
 clerked
 for
 a
 federal


judge
 and
 and
 we
 saw
 a
 lot
 of
 this


litigation,
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 prosay.
 I
 don't


know
 that
 they're,
 you
 know,
 providing


AI
 access
 in
 in
 prisons
 unfortunately
 uh


in
 terms
 of
 litigation,
 but
 I
 I
 think
 I


actually
 think
 there
 are
 going
 to
 be
 a


lot
 of
 annoyed
 judges
 because
 there's


going
 this
 is
 going
 to
 happen.
 It
 also


might
 be
 the
 case
 that
 it
 uh
 raises
 the


floor
 of


>> you
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 bad
 legal
 writing
 even


from
 lawyers
 and
 and
 I
 could
 see
 it


getting
 it
 actually
 getting
 a
 little
 bit


easier
 to
 be
 a
 to
 be
 a
 judge
 and
 a


clerk.


>> If
 everything
 becomes
 more


volumeoriented
 or
 the
 business
 model


becomes
 more
 about
 the
 volume
 rather


than
 the
 billable
 hours.
 Do
 you
 see
 a


situation
 where
 I
 guess
 the
 emphasis
 on


sourcing
 deals
 in
 corporate
 law
 or


sourcing
 cases
 um
 in
 plaintiff


>> does
 that
 become
 more
 important
 like


that's
 the
 skill
 set
 that
 you
 actually


need
 that
 sort
 of
 like
 matchmaker


process?
 I
 think
 that
 there's
 yes
 I


think
 f
 look
 finding
 finding
 the
 deals


making
 the
 the
 economics
 of
 the
 of
 the


relationship
 work
 is
 going
 to
 go
 up
 a


lot
 in
 value
 you
 know
 I
 think
 it's


already
 the
 case
 you
 you
 all
 see
 legal


advertisements
 for
 personal
 injury


lawyers
 everywhere
 all
 the
 time


>> pain
 law
 yo


>> it's
 so
 I
 mean
 legal
 search
 terms
 on
 on


Google
 are
 are
 the
 most
 expensive
 uh


cost
 per
 click
 I
 mean
 these
 thousands
 of


dollars
 for
 cost
 per
 click.
 Case


acquisition,
 I
 think,
 is
 might
 go
 up


even
 more
 because
 if
 you
 can
 just
 get


the
 case
 in


you're
 working
 less
 on
 the
 case,
 but


you're
 still
 getting
 your
 third


contingency
 fee,
 you
 might
 be
 willing
 to


pay
 even
 more
 and
 more
 to
 just
 generate


this
 volume.
 I
 mean,
 already
 mills


exist.
 They
 call
 them,
 you
 know,


plaintiffs
 mills.
 People
 who
 are
 doing,


you
 know,
 600
 cases
 per,
 you
 know,
 every


couple
 attorneys
 or
 something
 like
 that.


the
 economics
 of
 that
 and
 just
 acquiring


the
 case
 are
 going
 to
 go
 I
 think
 way
 way


up
 until
 maybe
 they
 start
 competing
 on


price
 because
 they
 can
 do
 so
 much
 more


volume.


>> I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 advertising.
 Hey,


have
 you
 Tracy
 Orel
 have
 either
 of
 you


heard
 the
 radio
 ads
 for
 Top
 Dog
 Law?


>> Yes.


>> Um
 I
 have
 not.


>> You
 every
 listener
 go
 to
 YouTube
 and


just
 type
 top
 dog
 law
 ad.
 They're
 the


most
 incredible,
 aren't
 they,
 Joel?
 Like


they're
 really
 incredible.


>> Yes.
 like
 just
 go
 search
 right
 now
 or


when
 the
 episode
 and
 listen
 to
 some
 of


these
 um
 ads.
 Do
 you
 buy
 ads
 on
 Google?


>> I
 I've
 done
 some
 Google
 ad
 campaigns.
 I


haven't
 really
 um


>> This
 is
 actually
 another
 topic
 we're


interested
 in.


>> But
 a
 lot
 of
 I
 mean
 a
 lot
 of
 plaintiff


side
 civil
 rights
 lawyers
 are
 are
 buying


space.
 It's
 just
 not
 how
 I've
 chosen
 to


compete.
 I
 do
 more
 referrals
 from


defense
 lawyers,
 that
 sort
 of
 thing.
 But


I
 mean
 I
 I
 actually
 have
 started
 to


think
 about
 right
 we
 we
 know
 this
 stuff


about
 young
 people
 are
 starting
 to
 use


chat
 GBT
 and
 other
 services
 as
 their


sort
 of
 portal
 to
 the
 internet.
 They're


using
 it
 for
 search


>> and
 so
 right
 all
 of
 these
 law
 firms


spend
 a
 lot
 on
 SEO.
 Uh
 but
 what
 is
 SEO


in
 a
 generative
 AI
 world
 is
 sort
 of
 an


interesting
 question.
 What
 are
 people


what
 are
 the
 the
 engines
 turning
 up
 in


terms
 of
 search
 terms?
 What
 do
 you
 have


to
 have
 on
 your
 website
 in
 order
 to
 get


people
 to
 find
 you
 through
 GPT
 rather


than
 Google?


>> Is
 Lexus
 Nexus
 doing
 anything
 with
 AI?


>> They
 are.
 I
 have
 not
 really
 used
 their


AI
 products.
 Lexus
 and
 I
 know
 Weslaw
 is


doing
 the
 same.
 I'm
 I
 use
 Lexus.
 I


assume
 Bloomberg
 Law,
 which
 is
 also
 is


doing
 something
 similar,
 but
 right
 now


the
 the
 models
 that
 that
 they're
 using


just
 aren't
 as
 good
 as
 03.
 is
 basically


and
 so
 if
 you're
 still
 calling
 to
 a
 four


era
 GPT
 or
 or
 similar
 from
 from
 claude


or
 whatever
 that
 sort
 of
 quality
 I
 just


don't
 think
 that
 they're
 getting
 good


enough
 research.
 I
 think
 it
 really
 was


whatever
 that
 step
 change
 was
 to
 to
 03's


level
 I
 think
 has
 uh
 made
 the
 research


so
 much
 better
 that
 I
 just
 use
 it
 and


then
 I'll
 go
 look
 at
 all
 the
 cases
 on


Lexus.
 the
 difference
 in
 what
 you
 can


actually
 learn
 from
 40
 or
 whatever
 40
 I


don't
 the
 naming
 convention
 versus
 03
 it


really
 is
 a
 very
 big
 deal
 and
 I
 think


like
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 formed
 impressions


pre3
 impressions
 what
 other
 tools
 are


out
 there
 that
 are
 interesting
 or
 that


come
 across
 your
 world
 whether
 it's
 like


I
 mean
 yeah
 we've
 been
 talking
 a
 lot


about
 03
 and
 you
 mentioned
 that
 other


one
 brief
 something
 is
 there
 anything


else
 out
 there
 that's
 exciting
 or


interesting
 or
 promising


>> there's
 one
 I
 looked
 at
 that
 looked


promising
 thing
 uh
 it's
 like
 Iudis
 or
 IQ


IQ
 ID
 something
 like
 that
 and
 they


looked
 pretty
 interesting
 in
 terms
 of


sort
 of
 being
 full
 Sweden
 wraparound


there's
 Harvey
 AI
 but
 they're
 really


focused
 on
 on
 big
 law
 firms
 but
 I
 know


that
 they're
 working
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 big


firms
 but
 you
 know
 the
 technology
 you


know
 for
 me
 that
 looks
 promising
 would


be
 people
 where
 I
 can
 safely
 upload


medical
 records
 and
 get
 instead
 of


trolling
 through
 200
 300
 pages
 just
 like


what
 was
 each
 progress
 note
 what
 did
 it


say
 what's
 the
 injury,
 that
 sort
 of


thing.
 And
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 coming.


There
 are
 I
 think
 it's
 I
 maybe
 something


from
 case
 text
 or
 that
 summarizes


depositions.
 And
 of
 course,
 that's


another
 thing
 where
 I've
 tried
 to
 use
 it


in
 the
 past
 and
 it
 wasn't
 very
 good.
 I


think
 just
 the
 context
 windows
 that
 they


were
 able
 to
 use
 haven't
 been


sufficiently
 large,
 but
 I
 think
 with


with
 rag
 and
 with
 more
 with
 better


models,
 I
 think
 that
 will
 get
 better
 and


better.
 you
 know,
 like
 the
 this
 is
 the


Ben
 Thompson
 line
 of
 this
 is
 the
 worst


they're
 ever
 going
 to
 be.
 Yeah.
 Is
 is


something
 that
 I'm
 constantly
 trying
 to


think
 about
 because
 I've
 used
 these


these
 products
 in
 the
 past
 or
 tested


them
 and
 they
 haven't
 been
 very


impressive.
 But
 I
 also
 used
 40
 and


wasn't
 very
 impressed
 that
 it's
 legal


research
 and
 have
 seen
 that
 that
 jump.


And
 so
 I
 assume
 in
 terms
 of
 taking


depositions
 and
 and
 getting
 concise


summaries
 of
 the
 most
 important
 facts


for
 your
 case,
 that's
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot


better.
 I
 just
 think
 the
 products
 aren't


there
 yet.
 And
 maybe
 because
 the
 API


calls
 for
 the
 LLMs
 just
 aren't
 to
 their


newest
 models
 yet
 or
 it's
 too
 expensive,


but
 I
 assume
 that's
 getting
 cheaper


every,
 you
 know,
 Moore's
 law
 still


applies.


>> If
 you
 had
 to
 bet,
 if
 you
 had
 to
 put


actual
 money
 on
 this
 question,
 would
 you


say
 there
 will
 be
 more
 or
 less
 lawyers


say
 10
 years
 from
 now?


>> Uh,
 as
 a
 percentage
 of
 the
 population.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 a
 great
 question.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 the
 caveat,
 J.
 That's


important.


>> And
 I
 hadn't
 I
 hadn't
 thought
 about
 this


one.
 I
 would
 I
 would
 bet
 on
 fewer,
 but


not
 that
 much.
 I
 would
 say
 I
 I
 I
 don't


think
 this
 is,
 you
 know,
 um
 uh
 going
 to


wipe
 out
 lawyers.
 I
 think
 fewer
 and
 what


they
 do
 will
 change
 a
 lot.
 Could
 you


imagine?
 You
 know,
 tech
 people
 are


obsessed
 with
 the
 mythical
 who
 will
 be


the
 first
 person
 to
 have
 a
 billion


dollar
 startup
 with
 no
 employees.
 Could


that
 be
 like,
 okay,
 you
 have
 you
 hung
 a


shingle
 out,
 I
 think
 is
 a
 phrase
 that


sometimes
 people
 use.
 Could
 you
 imagine


a
 mega
 firm
 with
 one
 employee?


>> I
 could
 imagine


>> a
 mega
 lawyer
 with,


>> you
 know,
 so
 you
 you
 right
 you
 you
 think


of
 Seleno,
 Seleno
 and
 Barnes,
 those


sorts
 of
 firms,
 these
 big
 big
 plaintiffs


law
 firms.
 I
 think


>> lawyers
 that
 they
 have


>> that
 I
 actually
 don't
 know,
 but
 it's
 a


lot
 and
 it's
 all
 across
 the
 country.
 But


so
 much
 of
 what
 they
 do
 is
 make
 the


discovery
 demand,
 respond
 to
 the


demands,
 do
 the
 the
 get
 the
 medical


records,
 send
 out
 a
 settlement
 demand


letter,
 negotiate
 with
 the
 opposing


council
 for
 or
 the
 carrier
 from
 the


insurer.
 You
 know,
 my
 client
 has
 a
 a


torn
 rotator
 cuff
 and
 a
 torn
 meniscus
 or


something
 like
 that
 from
 this
 car


accident
 and
 they
 have
 an
 exact
 expected


value
 of
 the
 case
 and
 it's
 just


negotiating
 that.
 And
 I
 think
 they
 could


go
 from,
 you
 know,
 let's
 say
 a
 hundred


cases
 per
 attorney
 to
 a
 thousand
 or
 to


2,000
 because
 they
 could
 set
 up
 an


automated
 workflow
 a
 lot
 easier,
 I


think.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 that
 person


could
 could
 start
 making
 50
 million
 or


100
 million
 a
 year
 per
 one
 lawyer
 than


than
 the,
 you
 know,
 already
 5
 million


that
 they're
 making
 or
 something
 like


that.
 These
 top
 firms.


>> One
 last
 little
 question.
 I
 mentioned


you're
 a
 poker
 player.
 In
 poker,
 you


know,
 big
 thing
 has
 been
 the
 emergence


of
 solvers.
 and
 you
 go
 back
 and
 you
 like


look
 at
 the
 did
 you
 play
 it
 very
 well


but
 it's
 all
 about
 what
 you
 kind
 of
 what


you
 described
 of
 like


>> you're
 calculate
 your
 EV
 right
 and
 did


you
 play
 it
 right
 and
 you
 don't
 always


win
 and
 you
 may
 have
 calculated
 EV
 right


and
 you
 took
 on
 the
 case
 but
 you
 don't


get
 the
 outcome
 how
 scientific
 is
 that


the
 uh
 calculating
 Eevee
 on
 a
 given
 case


and
 has
 that
 is
 there
 technology
 that's


working
 on
 that


>> so
 it's
 not
 very
 scientific
 at
 all
 you


know
 it's
 uh
 you
 can
 assess
 liability
 I


think
 pretty
 reasonably.
 Is
 this
 going


to
 be
 something
 where
 we're
 definitely


going
 to
 win?
 You
 know,
 the
 personal


injury
 uh
 car
 accident
 lawyers
 who
 say,


you
 know,
 the
 police
 report
 says
 this


person
 made
 an
 illegal
 left
 turn,


perfect
 liability.
 I'm
 going
 to
 win


instantly
 and
 then
 you're
 just


evaluating
 the
 damages.
 One
 thing
 I've


actually
 explored
 is
 is
 looking
 into


whether
 LLMs
 can
 estimate
 the
 damages


based
 on
 the
 injuries
 that
 you
 describe.


Pretty
 well.
 go
 through
 the
 case
 law


where
 there's
 cases,
 this
 is
 called
 uh


remittitor
 cases
 where
 you
 you
 might


hear
 like,
 oh,
 this
 person
 got
 a
 $100


million
 for
 their,
 you
 know,
 hot
 coffee


or
 whatever,
 you
 know,
 these
 sort
 of


classic
 cases
 and
 a
 judge
 will
 knock
 it


down.
 They'll
 say
 this
 case
 with
 this


injury
 is
 only
 worth
 this
 much.
 But
 you


could
 take
 all
 that
 language
 and
 start


to
 estimate,
 you
 know,
 quantify
 uh


because
 words
 are
 numbers
 with
 with


these
 programs.
 You
 could
 start
 to


quantify
 what
 what
 are
 the
 injuries


worth
 in
 the
 in
 the
 case
 law
 and
 then


multiply
 that
 by.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 sort


of
 thing
 is
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 more


scientific
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 use
 it


on
 the
 carrier
 side.
 So
 Geico
 is
 going


to
 be
 able
 to
 say,
 you
 know,
 you've


described
 these
 injuries.
 we
 have
 a


database
 of
 a
 thousand
 cases
 just
 like


this
 and
 this
 was
 what
 we
 you
 know
 and


then
 you
 could
 haggle
 oh
 well
 this
 is
 a


great
 plaintiff
 or
 something
 like
 that


and
 um
 they're
 super
 sympathetic
 and
 you


know
 have
 that
 negotiation
 but
 I
 think


that
 process
 of
 evaluating
 the
 exact


value
 of
 a
 of
 an
 injury
 or
 or
 of
 a
 case


is
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 uh
 more
 scientific


and
 facilitate
 settlements
 to
 to
 happen


quicker.
 I
 imagine
 AI
 might
 be


especially
 useful
 in
 class
 action


lawsuits
 as
 well
 where
 you're
 dealing


with
 like
 finding
 thousands
 of
 people


potentially
 to
 attach
 to
 a
 case
 and
 then


actually
 contacting
 them
 and
 getting


information
 from
 them.


>> I
 that
 that
 seems
 reasonable
 to
 me.


Also,
 in
 the
 class
 action
 cases,
 you


just
 got
 a
 volume
 of
 of
 data
 that
 you


have
 to
 do
 discovery
 on,
 but
 it
 it


hadn't
 occurred
 to
 me.
 But,
 you
 know,
 I


do
 know
 that
 sometimes
 class
 actions


start
 because
 somebody
 finds
 a
 Reddit


thread
 and
 they
 see
 on
 Reddit,
 you
 know,


people
 all
 the
 people
 are
 all


complaining
 about
 this
 same
 issue
 with


this
 product
 or
 something
 like
 that
 and


the
 the
 lawyers,
 you
 know,
 reach
 out
 to


them.
 And
 so,
 it
 is
 entirely
 possible.
 I


could
 I
 could
 see
 that
 that


>> that's
 another
 thing
 where
 you
 could


have
 AI
 just
 trolling
 the
 internet
 for


possible
 cases.


>> I
 I
 I
 think
 so.
 Or,
 you
 know,
 what
 are


people
 posting
 about
 on
 on
 Twitter?
 What


are
 they
 all
 getting
 harmed
 by?
 I
 don't


know.
 So,
 it's
 it
 seems
 entirely


plausible.


>> Since
 you
 mentioned
 it,
 I
 just
 want
 to


say
 you
 mentioned
 illegal
 lefts
 and


Tracy
 and
 listeners,


I
 had
 a
 issue
 last
 year
 where
 I
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 get
 into
 it,
 but
 it
 involved


taking
 an
 illegal
 left
 turn.


>> Joe's
 a
 criminal.


>> I'm
 not.
 But
 thank
 And


>> were
 you
 found
 innocent?


I
 am
 not
 a
 criminal
 thanks
 to
 a
 uh


referral
 that
 our
 guest
 here
 Joel
 helped


make
 for
 me.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 say
 we're


not
 going
 to
 talk
 anymore
 about
 the


case.
 It
 was
 super
 annoying.
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 say
 anything
 more,
 but
 I
 just


want
 to
 I'm
 it's
 my
 disclosure
 for
 this


episode.
 So
 Joel
 Wortheheimer,
 thank
 you


so
 much
 for
 coming
 on
 Oddlo.
 That
 was


fantastic.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.


[Music]


Tracy,
 before
 we
 talk
 about
 conclusions,


I
 must
 press
 upon
 listeners
 again
 to


search
 for
 top
 dog
 law
 firm
 ads.
 In


fact,
 after
 we
 do
 this
 episode,
 we
 walk


back
 to
 our
 desk.
 Tracy,
 I'm
 going
 to


insist
 that
 you
 watch
 a
 few
 of
 them.


>> I
 love
 that
 your
 priority
 for
 this


episode.
 The
 one
 thing
 you
 must
 get
 out


of
 this
 episode
 is
 listening
 to
 Top
 Dog


app.


>> No,
 I
 swear
 I
 was
 driving.
 I
 was
 in
 a


Uber
 home
 several
 months
 ago
 and
 this
 ad


came
 on
 the
 radio
 and
 it
 was
 like


nothing
 I
 had
 ever
 heard
 in
 my
 entire


life.
 Nothing
 will
 prepare
 you
 for
 this


this
 law
 firm's
 ads.
 Anyway,
 we
 could


talk
 about


>> I
 am
 very
 intrigued.


>> All
 right.
 Well,
 that
 was
 a
 fantastic


conversation.
 One
 thing
 I
 am
 wondering


is,
 you
 know,
 in
 the
 US
 there
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 talk
 about
 an
 overly
 uh
 latigious


society
 and
 I
 kind
 of
 wonder
 if
 AI
 is


potentially
 just
 going
 to
 make
 it
 worse.


It
 sounds
 very
 plausible
 to
 me
 that
 it


it
 will
 make
 it
 worse
 or
 better
 or


worse,
 but
 I
 think
 like
 you
 know
 it
 does


my
 guess
 is
 that
 there's
 going
 to
 be


some
 sort
 of
 you
 know
 Jeff's
 paradox


thing
 where
 like
 some
 existing
 labor


will
 get
 really
 cheap
 or
 maybe


completely
 unnecessary
 and
 then
 other


you
 know
 the
 optimistic
 version
 is
 that


defendants
 or
 people
 without
 a
 lot
 of


money
 get
 better
 quality
 representation.


I
 get,
 you
 know,
 it
 feels
 like
 it's
 not


going
 to
 dis,
 it's
 gonna
 probably
 have


very
 big
 distributional
 and
 qualitative


shifts
 on
 the
 industry.


>> Yeah.
 And
 this
 is
 the
 thing
 I'm
 also


wondering.
 So,
 okay,
 junior
 associates,


maybe
 they
 h
 they're
 doing
 less
 work,


maybe
 they're
 slightly
 happier,
 but
 I


guess
 the
 idea
 that
 more
 of
 the
 value


just
 accrs
 to
 the
 partners
 at
 a
 time


when
 it's
 harder
 to
 become
 partner,
 uh,


that
 seems
 to
 be
 the
 downside
 if
 you're


going
 into
 the
 legal
 profession,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 No,
 totally.
 like
 it
 feels
 like


we're
 at
 this
 moment
 and
 this
 applies
 to


a
 lot
 of
 actually
 AI
 economics
 questions


and
 we
 should
 definitely
 do
 more
 on
 them


where
 people
 uh
 imagine
 or
 people
 maybe


even
 rightly
 surmise
 that
 you
 know


there'll
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 benefits
 for
 you


know
 existing
 holders
 of
 wealth
 or


companies
 could
 do
 layoffs
 right


>> and
 I
 don't
 know
 the
 degree
 to
 that


which
 is
 really
 happening
 but
 at least


in
 theory
 and
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 firing


of
 junior
 workers


But
 that's
 like
 a
 temporary
 condition


because
 you
 know
 first
 of
 all
 like
 okay


a
 company
 saves
 a
 bunch
 of
 money
 by


firing
 what
 eventually
 becomes


characterized
 as
 grunt
 work.
 Well
 what


do
 they
 spend
 that
 money
 on
 right


because
 that's
 savings
 and
 so
 does
 that


do
 they
 invest
 it?
 Does
 that
 turn
 into


consumption
 for
 the
 partners?
 Like
 there


are
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 know
 people's
 like
 oh


it's
 going
 to
 be
 mass
 layoffs
 but
 I


never
 find
 these
 questions
 very


satisfying
 because
 the
 money
 doesn't


disappear.
 It's
 someone's
 savings
 and


someone's
 savings
 either
 becomes


someone's
 consumption
 or
 someone's


investment
 and
 anyone's
 consumption
 or


investment
 becomes
 someone
 else's


income.
 So
 therefore,
 you
 know,
 thinking


through
 some
 of
 these
 next
 level
 things


I
 think
 is
 really
 important
 and
 AI


clearly
 seems
 like
 ground
 zero
 and
 I
 do


think
 03
 is
 really
 good
 and
 everyone
 no


seriously
 everyone
 needs
 to
 check
 it
 out


and
 like
 update
 their
 views
 if
 they


haven't
 yet
 on
 the
 quality
 of
 the


research
 you
 can
 do.
 Um,
 it
 does
 sound


like
 it's
 maybe
 solved
 the
 hallucination


problem
 that
 was
 that
 everyone
 was


making
 fun
 of
 earlier.


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 like
 they're
 still
 there


for
 sure,
 but
 because
 you
 can
 actually


find
 links
 to
 documents
 and
 stuff
 like


that,
 the
 speed
 with
 which
 you
 can
 get


up
 to
 speed
 on
 anything
 is
 very


impressive.


>> All right,
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 test
 it.

 we
 leave
 it
