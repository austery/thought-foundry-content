From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Thursday,
 January
 29th.
 Here's
 what


we're
 covering.


>> This
 is
 not
 border
 security.
 This
 is
 not


law
 and
 order.
 This
 is
 chaos
 created
 at


the
 top
 and
 felt
 in
 so
 many
 of
 our


neighborhoods.
 Top
 Senate
 Democrats
 led


by
 Chuck
 Schumer
 are
 demanding
 new


restrictions
 on
 federal
 immigration


agents
 in
 exchange
 for
 averting
 a


government
 shutdown.
 Funding
 for


multiple
 federal
 agencies
 is
 set
 to


lapse
 tomorrow
 night
 unless
 at
 least
 a


handful
 of
 Democrats
 join
 with


Republicans
 to
 push
 through
 a
 spending


package.
 Democrats,
 however,
 are
 calling


for
 the
 Senate
 to
 split
 off
 funding
 for


the
 Department
 of
 Homeland
 Security,


which
 includes
 ICE,
 so
 they
 can
 vote
 on


that
 separately
 and
 negotiate
 for


restrictions
 on
 agents
 behavior.


>> We
 want
 masks
 off,
 body
 cameras
 on,
 no


more
 anonymous
 agents,
 no
 more
 secret


operatives.
 The
 Times
 has
 learned
 that


as
 of
 last
 night,
 Schumer
 and
 President


Trump
 seemed
 to
 be
 moving
 toward
 a


possible
 agreement,
 though
 officials


with
 knowledge
 of
 their
 discussion
 said


a
 lot
 of
 hurdles
 remained.
 There's


expected
 to
 be
 a
 test
 vote
 on
 the


spending
 package
 with
 DHS
 funding
 still


included
 in
 the
 Senate
 this
 morning.


Meanwhile,
 in
 Minnesota,
 the
 Trump


administration's
 facing
 growing
 push


back
 from
 the
 courts
 over
 its
 aggressive


immigration
 enforcement
 operations.
 The


chief
 federal
 judge
 there
 lambasted
 ICE


yesterday,
 saying
 the
 agency
 had


violated
 nearly
 100
 court
 orders
 and
 had


disobeyed
 more
 judicial
 directives
 this


month
 alone
 than
 some
 federal
 agencies


had
 in
 their
 entire
 existence.


That
 included
 things
 like
 ignoring
 court


orders
 to
 let
 ICE
 detainees
 challenge


their
 detention
 or
 be
 released.
 After


attaching
 a
 rundown
 of
 the
 orders
 he


said
 ICE
 failed
 to
 follow,
 the
 judge


wrote,
 "This
 list
 should
 give
 pause
 to


anyone,
 no
 matter
 his
 or
 her
 political


beliefs,
 who
 cares
 about
 the
 rule
 of


law."


And
 another
 federal
 judge
 ordered
 agents


in
 the
 state
 to
 stop
 detaining
 and


deporting
 refugees.
 Agents
 have
 swept
 up


at
 least
 100
 people
 so
 far,
 even
 though


they'd
 already
 been
 carefully
 vetted.


Some
 of
 them
 were
 shackled,
 flown
 to


Texas,
 and
 held
 for
 days,
 then
 released


with
 no
 way
 to
 get
 back
 home.
 The
 judge


wrote
 that
 people
 with
 refugee
 status


have
 a
 legal
 right
 to
 live
 peacefully
 in


the
 US.


Now,
 three
 other
 quick
 updates
 on
 the


administration.


President
 Trump
 has
 sharply
 intensified


his
 threats
 against
 Iran,
 saying
 the
 US


could
 attack
 soon
 with
 quote
 speed
 and


violence
 if
 the
 country
 doesn't
 agree
 to


a
 set
 of
 demands.
 Trump
 didn't
 outline


what
 those
 demands
 are,
 but
 the
 US
 has


been
 pushing
 for
 Iran
 to
 wind
 down
 its


nuclear
 program
 and
 stop
 supporting


proxy
 groups
 like
 Hamas
 and
 Hezbollah,


among
 other
 things.
 The
 threat
 comes
 as


the
 US
 Navy
 has
 moved
 ships,
 including


an
 aircraft
 carrier,
 into
 striking


distance
 of
 Iran.
 And
 Trump
 explicitly


compared
 the
 buildup
 of
 forces
 to
 what


he
 ordered
 near
 Venezuela
 before
 US


troops
 captured
 its
 president.
 Iran's


foreign
 minister
 recently
 warned
 the
 US


that
 an
 all-out
 confrontation
 would
 be


messy
 and
 ferocious.


Also
 in
 a
 hearing
 on
 Capitol
 Hill


yesterday,


>> they
 will
 submit
 every
 month
 a
 budget
 of


this
 is
 what
 we
 need
 funded.
 We
 will


provide
 for
 them
 at
 the
 front
 end
 what


that
 money
 cannot
 be
 used
 for.
 And


they've
 been
 very
 cooperative
 in
 this


regard.
 In
 fact,


>> Secretary
 of
 State
 Marco
 Rubio
 gave
 new


details
 about
 how
 the
 Trump


administration
 is
 exerting
 control
 over


Venezuela.
 He
 said
 the
 White
 House
 will


oversee
 the
 sale
 of
 Venezuelan
 oil,
 then


decide
 what
 revenue
 from
 that
 goes
 back


to
 the
 country.
 He
 said
 the
 money
 will


come
 by
 way
 of
 an
 account
 managed
 by


Qatar.


>> I
 understand
 it's
 novel,
 but
 it's
 the


best
 we
 could
 come
 up
 with
 in
 the
 short


term
 to
 ensure
 that
 they're


>> Rubio
 said
 the
 third
 party
 account
 was


necessary
 because
 of
 US
 financial


sanctions
 on
 Venezuela.
 But
 Democratic


senators
 questioned
 the
 legality
 of
 the


arrangement
 and
 criticized
 the


administration's
 open-ended
 involvement


in
 the
 country.


>> You
 are
 taking
 their
 oil
 at
 gunpoint.


You're
 deciding
 how
 and
 for
 what


purposes
 that
 money
 is
 going
 to
 be
 used


in
 a
 country
 of
 30
 million
 people.
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 believe
 that
 that
 is


destined
 for
 failure.
 And
 I
 know
 that


you're
 telling
 us
 today
 just
 to
 be


patient.


>> And
 last
 update
 in
 Fulton
 County,


Georgia
 yesterday,
 FBI
 agents
 executed
 a


search
 warrant
 at
 an
 election
 center
 in


an
 attempt
 to
 seize
 ballots
 from
 the


2020
 election.
 It's
 the
 latest
 sign
 that


the
 Trump
 administration
 is
 doubling


down
 on
 the
 president's
 baseless
 claims


that
 the
 election
 was
 rigged.
 Fulton


County,
 which
 voted
 overwhelmingly
 for


Joe
 Biden,
 has
 been
 at
 the
 center
 of


those
 conspiracy
 theories,
 and
 it's


where
 Trump
 himself
 was
 criminally


charged
 with
 election
 interference.
 The


warrant
 said
 the
 FBI
 was
 investigating


the
 possible
 destruction
 of
 election


related
 records,
 among
 other
 things.
 A


Democratic
 commissioner
 in
 the
 county,


however,
 accused
 Trump
 of
 trying
 to


create
 chaos
 before
 the
 midterm


elections,
 saying,
 quote,
 "This
 is
 all


about
 November
 2026."


Over
 the
 last
 year
 or
 so,
 news
 about
 the


price
 of
 gold
 rising
 and
 rising
 has


become
 common.
 Just
 this
 week,
 gold
 hit


a
 record
 high,
 surging
 over
 $5,000
 an


ounce.
 But
 now
 silver
 is
 surging
 even


faster
 with
 some
 analysts
 calling
 it


gold
 on
 steroids.
 To
 be
 clear,
 it's
 not


worth
 as
 much
 as
 gold.
 The
 price
 of


silver
 just
 crossed
 $100
 an
 ounce,
 but


it
 is
 rising
 at
 breakneck
 speeds.
 Some


of
 that
 momentum
 likely
 comes
 from
 the


waves
 of
 instability
 that
 have
 been


sweeping
 the
 globe,
 trade
 tensions,


wars,
 or
 the
 threat
 of
 wars,
 rising


debt,
 etc.
 When
 things
 get
 bumpy,


investors
 look
 for
 safe
 places
 to
 park


their
 money.
 But
 there
 are
 other
 factors


at
 play.
 China
 has
 been
 cracking
 down
 on


silver
 exports
 this
 year.
 And
 silver
 has


a
 lot
 of
 very
 in
 demand
 industrial
 uses


right
 now
 because
 of
 its
 ability
 to


conduct
 electricity.
 Silver
 is
 used
 in


everything
 from
 solar
 panels
 to
 the
 data


centers
 that
 power
 AI.


Still,
 some
 market
 forecasters
 are


warning
 that
 silver's
 rally
 may
 be


getting
 ahead
 of
 itself.
 Bank
 of
 America


gave
 silver
 the
 highest
 ranking
 on
 its


recent
 list
 of
 investments
 that
 have


quote
 bubblelike
 asset
 dynamics.


And
 finally,
 there's
 a
 new
 documentary


opening
 in
 theaters
 this
 weekend.


Documentaries,
 of
 course,
 are
 not


typically
 blockbusters,
 but
 this
 one
 has


a
 $35
 million
 marketing
 budget
 behind


it,
 complete
 with
 a
 trailer
 that
 ran


during
 the
 NFL
 playoffs
 and
 a
 giant
 ad


in
 Times
 Square.


>> Here
 we
 go
 again.


>> It
 is
 Melania.
 The
 film
 follows
 the


first
 lady
 in
 the
 days
 leading
 up
 to


Trump's
 inauguration
 last
 year.


>> Hi,
 Mr.
 President.
 Congratulations.


>> Did
 you
 watch
 it?


>> I
 did
 not.
 Yeah,
 I
 will
 see
 it
 on
 the


news.


>> The
 documentary
 has
 drawn
 controversy


ever
 since
 it
 went
 into
 production.
 It


was
 directed
 by
 Brett
 Ratner,
 who
 hasn't


made
 a
 film
 since
 2017
 when
 multiple


women
 accused
 him
 of
 sexual
 misconduct.


More
 eyebrows
 went
 up
 when
 the


documentary
 was
 sold.
 Amazon
 paid


Melania
 Trump's
 production
 company
 $40


million
 for
 the
 film's
 rights.
 That
 was


26
 million
 more
 than
 the
 next
 highest


bidder.
 In
 a
 statement,
 Amazon
 said,
 "We


licensed
 the
 film
 for
 one
 reason
 and
 one


reason
 only,
 because
 we
 think
 customers


are
 going
 to
 love
 it,
 but
 many
 in


Hollywood
 have
 questioned
 the
 company's


motivations
 since
 Amazon
 is
 unlikely
 to


recoup
 its
 massive
 investment."
 One


former
 senior
 employee
 at
 Amazon's
 film


division
 called
 it
 a
 blatant
 attempt
 to


win
 over
 the
 Trumps.
 He
 said,
 quote,


"How
 can
 it
 not
 be
 equated
 with
 curing


favor
 or
 an
 outright
 bribe?"
 For


comparison,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 another


political
 documentary,
 the
 2018
 Oscar


nominated
 film
 RBG
 about
 the
 life
 of
 the


Supreme
 Court
 justice,
 it
 had
 a
 total


promotional
 budget
 of
 about
 $3
 million,


less
 than
 a
 tenth
 of
 what's
 being
 spent


to
 push
 Melania.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy


Mumford.
 We'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow
 with
 the


latest
 and
 the
 Friday
 news
 quiz.
