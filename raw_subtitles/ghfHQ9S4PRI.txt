we feel losses just about twice as intensely as we enjoy gains. And when you think about what that means, when the markets begin to wobble, when they sell off, it sends our bodies aflame. It makes us concerned that we're going to lose our money, we're going to lose our investments. Hey, we're down 5%. We better do something or we're going to be down 10%. What we really need to learn is that markets are down 5%, you know, two, three times a year. They're down 10%, just about two out of every three years. Markets go up and down. Risk and reward are two sides of the same coin. And if you want to be in it for the long term to garner the reward, you have to go through the risk, through the drawdown, through the difficult periods. And that's where getting your loss aversion, at least understanding it, you may never be able to get it under control, but understanding it and preventing it from affecting your decision making becomes really important.
