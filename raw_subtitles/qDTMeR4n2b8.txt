Can I get a show of hands
if you use a wearable?
Fitbit, Oura, Apple Watch,
track your health, come on.
OK, OK, it's like 50 percent of you.
I love this.
So my question for us today,
for you, but also the non-wearables,
is what if we expanded
from not just measuring our health
but to measuring all the important
parts of our lives?
So this really started for me
right after I turned 25,
and I started to wake up
in the middle of the night
pretty consistently with these panics.
A lot of folks wake up with to-do lists
bouncing through their minds.
A lot of you maybe, some of you?
I had to-do lists, but I also had
this major to-be list.
Really just will I be a good man,
will I live a good life?
And now, I'm a pretty
insecure guy generally.
But I have this thing, I have one
of those extremely encouraging moms.
Which maybe some of you have.
Mine is very likely more encouraging.
And so, with her voice in my mind,
I would basically answer the question,
yeah, I am going to live a good life.
In fact, maybe she's right,
I will change millions of lives.
Maybe I'll be president.
So I had this narrative
from 25 to about 33,
and then I hit 33.
And I haven't changed that many lives.
And I find out one day
that Bill Clinton was already
a governor by 33,
which to most of you is no big deal.
But ask my wife, Ashley,
that broke me.
I think what happened is
it kind of shattered
this, sort of, mom-induced
megalomania I had,
and it made me take
an actual look at my life.
And so I looked at my professional life,
but then what about my friendships?
What about my contributions to society,
what about my character?
And honestly, I looked and I was fine,
but I wasn't thriving,
I wasn't flourishing.
And so then it struck me,
you know, Chris, a lot of people
don't live good lives.
Why do you think you would
automatically be any different?
What if I wake up in 50 years
and I discover I have not become
the man I wanted to be.
I'm guessing some of you
have similar thoughts,
because Gallup tells us that only
33 percent of us are thriving in life.
So if you're in the other
66 percent, like me,
how do we get into the 33 percent?
Now I am a management consultant.
And so there's one thing
that we love and believe deeply.
Say it with me if you know it.
What gets measured, gets managed.
Come on, guys, you know this.
(Laughter)
You know, what is it, 50 percent of us
use wearables to measure our health,
to presumably manage it,
but I couldn't find anything like that
to measure all the dimensions
that mattered in life.
So I created this super simple,
kind of clunky Excel tracker that I use.
So the first step was to identify
the dimensions of a good life.
So I started with my faith,
but then I brought in insights
from the thinkers
who've studied this stuff.
So from Aristotle to this thing
called the Harvard Happiness Study
to Martin Seligman's positive psychology
to Clayton Christensen’s
“How Will You Measure Your Life?”
to my professor Arthur Brooks's
research on happiness,
to this global flourishing study
and this cool article by my colleagues
at BCG called "Strategize Your Life."
And so I landed on these nine dimensions
of the good life for me.
You're seeing these and you're like,
pretty obvious, right?
Which is kind of the point,
because from the ancients to the moderns,
these ingredients
have been remarkably consistent.
They're knowable.
So step two, measure.
I had the privilege of working
for Gallup for a few years,
if you know them.
And so I had this nerdy thing
where I love building surveys.
So I turned these nine dimensions
into kind of a 20-ish question survey
that I answer pretty much every day.
Now, these are the questions.
I have a few others I answer weekly,
like contribution to society.
That's sort of a weekly thing for me.
My mom thinks it's daily, it's not.
(Laughter)
But these to me basically are the picture
of the good life to me.
And so for the past 18 months,
I've essentially answered
these questions every day.
I do it at 9pm on my couch, on my phone,
and it literally takes me 90 seconds.
But folks, this has been
a total game changer for me.
My therapists have told me --
I have multiple therapists simultaneously,
which I hear is not best practice,
but here's what they agree on, which is
I have a lot of cognitive distortions.
So, you know, these things,
some of you have them,
you're like, yeah,
I've got some of those, too.
These are things like
all-or-nothing thinking,
catastrophizing, overgeneralizing.
Like when you pop up the news
and you discover the sky is falling.
So for me, I was prepping
for this TED talk a month ago,
and I was already in pretty
good shape, I thought.
And so I sent a recording of myself
to some mentors, and I said,
you know, I'd love some feedback.
You know, I was asking
for, like, positive feedback.
(Laughter)
But then two of them responded
pretty quickly, and they said,
"Chris, uh, thanks.
Maybe we should talk."
Yeah.
And so we talked,
and both of them told me,
I kid you not, without
consulting with each other,
the talk was fine, but it was
a little bit dramatic.
And at the same time,
somehow a little bit flat.
Which, if you're like me,
that sent me spiraling.
So what I did, I kid you not,
I went into a dark room in the office
right after my calls,
and I pulled out my phone
and I journaled about all the ways
in which I am defective
across dimensions of life.
So yeah, public speaker obviously bad,
but what about at work?
Not good enough.
Husband? Not good enough.
Friend? Bad.
Told you I was insecure.
But see, this is where my brain takes me.
But the tracker really helps with this.
So here's one week in May.
Picture my tracker.
And this is a particularly tough Monday.
A lot of low scores, not many high scores.
So I fill this one out.
And my immediate thought is,
oh my gosh, my life is falling apart.
But then I take a step back,
and I notice that my Sunday was fine.
Pretty good.
My Saturday was good.
And then I keep going.
And sure enough, Chris,
I just had one bad day.
And the therapists are right.
I have the emotional stability
of a theater kid.
You know, for months,
Mondays would hit me super hard.
Anybody hate Mondays?
Two people hate Mondays.
Well I hate Mondays.
And so these are my scores
on several Mondays
over a course of a few months,
I get lowest scores across dimensions.
I don't love my wife well.
I pout at her, she calls me
pouty pants sometimes.
I didn't do well at work, I felt stressed,
I handled my emotions poorly,
I didn't eat well.
But then here's the thing,
I noticed this pattern.
Which is the Mondays were typically bad,
but this Monday storm always passes,
usually by Tuesday or Wednesday,
which shifts how I think about Mondays,
because there's a fundamental
difference between a tough day,
when you project it out
into eternity, as I often do,
and a bad day, when you already know
the end of the story.
And I also get tunnel vision,
especially at work.
My wife is a big logistics gal,
and I'm not a big logistics guy,
so she'll text me at work for logistics.
And this one time she did this
for 12.5 hours straight.
And I saw the text,
but I didn't really see see
the text, I didn't answer.
And so she knows me,
and so she sent me this
calendar invitation to my work email.
And I responded in 30 seconds.
So that's not just this bad habit.
It's really my default
to reduce myself to one dimension.
Especially at work.
Anyone else?
But the tracker helps with that too.
So here's a great week at work.
Crushed it.
But then spiritually, kind of off.
And then I look at other dimensions,
and I started out the week strong,
but then I kind of fell apart.
See, the tracker visually reminds me
that the good life
is not just one dimension.
In doing this every night,
it forces my brain to optimize
across dimensions,
to balance the trade-offs
and to adjust my focus when needed.
You know, I'll probably never forget,
I was sitting in a cabin
in mountains of North Carolina.
It was 9pm one day,
and I was filling out
my tracker on vacation,
and it struck me that night
for some reason
that my loving Ashley question
had been flashing red at me for months.
And the other dimensions
were basically green.
I was doing fine.
And for some reason,
that night, it struck me.
Chris, this is not the promise you
made Ashley on your wedding day.
This is not what you said to her.
Is this the way you want
to look back on your life?
That you had a good career,
but you neglected the one relationship
that you claim is the most
important to you?
That is not the good life.
That is a wasted life.
That is a failed life.
And that hit me super hard.
So I made some changes and sure enough,
within a few months
things started to shift.
The scores were improving,
but my wife noticed.
And I often wonder,
if I hadn't had the tracker,
how long would it have taken me
to get this wake-up call?
OK, so at this point
some of you are into this,
some of you are like,
"This is fine for you,
but I'm not that disciplined"
or "I don't like that much system."
I don’t like Excel.
So I get that, but here’s the thing.
I love filling out my tracker.
And I don’t think it’s
because I’m a consultant
and I like Excel.
I do like Excel.
But it’s because I feel myself
becoming a more full human.
But I am a consultant.
So I did build you three
versions of my tracker.
(Laughter)
The light, medium, heavy.
So you can download these
and actually measure your lives tonight.
You know, I still wake up
sometimes at 3am,
but now I don't really panic anymore.
I know I'm managing
the full picture of my life
because I'm measuring it.
And I’d invite you, join me.
Because the life you measure
just might be the good life.
Thank you.
(Applause)
