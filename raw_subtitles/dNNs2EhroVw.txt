- I'm Annaka Harris
and I write about the science
and philosophy of consciousness.
I have a book called "Conscious:
A Brief Guide to the Fundamental
Mystery of the Mind."
And I have a docuseries
titled "Lights on."
- [Narrator] Challenging the
illusions of consciousness
with Annaka Harris.
Part one: Defining consciousness.
What does your work in
consciousness entail?
- My work focuses on
what makes consciousness
such a deeply perplexing phenomenon
and a mysterious phenomenon,
why it's so difficult for
scientists to study it,
and because it's such
a mysterious phenomenon
still within neuroscience,
part of my work has also been
to connect different disciplines
that aren't usually in dialogue.
With consciousness studies,
if we're interested in asking the question
about whether consciousness
goes deeper in nature
than the sciences have previously assumed,
we start to come out of neuroscience
and meander into biology, plant sciences,
and depending on how
far down we wanna look,
ultimately physics.
And so part of my work is
helping the different disciplines
communicate with one another
so that they're all informed
about the same types of mystery
that we're facing in
consciousness studies.
- [Narrator] Why did you write your book?
- So one of the reasons I
wrote my book "Conscious"
was because I noticed
that when I was discussing
my work at dinner parties
and with friends,
I noticed that everyone I spoke to
became very interested and
had a lot of questions.
And that makes sense
because we all have an
experience of consciousness
and not only do we all
have an experience of it,
it is central to everything
we know and care about.
We can't even quite understand
what it would mean to
live our lives without it.
Everything that we care about,
everything we experience,
everything we know,
we know it through our
conscious awareness of it,
it is our immediate
contact with the universe,
with the rest of reality.
And you can see this
just by imagining you know
something that's important to you
or even something that's
not important to you.
Anything that happened to you today,
anything you're thinking about,
any decision you're trying to make.
Okay, try to think about that
or try to make that decision.
And imagine doing that
when you're not conscious.
You immediately realize
that this is where our lives play out.
This is in some sense, this is everything.
Our conscious awareness is everything.
And the fact that it's still so mysterious
to scientists and to all of humanity,
the fact that it's still one
of the great unsolved mysteries
makes it something that
everyone can be excited about
and that inspires awe in everyone.
And awe is this feeling
that we all enjoy kind of basking in.
And this is one of those
mysteries that is still unsolved
and so can still inspire
awe in most people
who start to think about it and discover
how mysterious it actually is.
- [Narrator] How do you
define consciousness?
- So the mystery at the
heart of consciousness,
and when I use the word consciousness,
I'm not talking about
higher order thinking
or complex thought,
or things that we think of in
terms of human consciousness,
but when I use the word consciousness,
I'm talking about consciousness
in the most fundamental sense,
this bare fact of felt experience.
So if a worm is conscious,
if there's something that
it's like to be a worm,
if there's a felt experience,
if there's sentience
associated with a worm
and there's no consensus
on this, in the sciences,
but if there is something
it's like to be a worm,
it obviously isn't planning it's day,
it's not having complex thoughts,
maybe it's experiencing
very subtle sensation
against its skin as it
moves through the dirt.
We can imagine that that is a possibility.
It's possible there's some
kind of internal desire
to move toward food or away from danger.
So when I use the word
consciousness in this context,
when talking about it as a mystery,
it's really in this most basic sense
as the fundamental felt experience
that we know
comes into being in the universe
from our own experience and
can extrapolate from that.
There's no perfect
definition for consciousness
in the way that I'm using it here
in the most fundamental sense.
And so the philosopher Thomas Nagel
wrote a famous essay titled,
"What Is It Like to Be a Bat?"
And I recommend this article
and I think it's extremely useful here
because rather than give a definition,
he illustrates a picture
of a totally different type of experience
than a human experience.
There's a German term for this, "umwelt,"
and it's the, umwelt is the word
for describing the types
of feelings and sensations
a certain type of organism has.
So a bat uses sonar rather than vision,
and we can't imagine what that's like.
We can maybe get close to
it or or draw analogies,
but a bat is moving through
the world using sonar,
so it's making sounds,
the sounds are bouncing off the walls
and the trees and the world
and it gets a picture
of its external world
in the same way that we get a picture
of the external world through vision.
But you can imagine that the
actual felt experience of that
is very different from our
experience of using vision.
And so when you think about
what certain experiences are like,
what it's like to be a bat,
what it's like to be a bee,
this gets at the, I think,
I think this gets at our intuition
for what consciousness is
in a more direct way than
some of the language does.
- [Narrator] What is the hard
problem of consciousness?
- So the mystery at the
heart of consciousness
is why in this universe
that seems to be teeming
with non-conscious matter,
with atoms, and electrons, and stars,
and solar systems, and all these things
that we assume don't
entail a felt experience
from the inside or they're non-conscious,
how non-conscious matter
somehow gets configured
in such a way as to create a situation
where suddenly it's
having a felt experience
from the inside.
Suddenly there's something
that it's like to be that matter,
and that is often referred to
as the hard problem of consciousness.
And that term comes from David
Chalmers, the philosopher,
and it's called the hard problem
because in a sense, it's a joke.
It's in comparison to
what are the easy problems
which aren't truly easy in neuroscience,
but the easy problems are more associating
which brain states are associated
with which feeling states.
The hard problem entails
why there is a felt
experience of any processing,
even brain processing at all.
- [Narrator] Is consciousness
different from thought?
- Making a distinction
between consciousness
and thought is important
because consciousness in the
sense that I'm interested in,
in the sense that it's a mystery
can exist without thought,
it can exist in a pure felt experience,
it could exist in a very simple organism
that is not capable of thought.
But even in our human experience,
we know that there can be
moments that are without thought,
especially if you think
of a very young child
or an infant feeling
pressure against the skin,
hearing sounds in the room
before the brain is even
able to distinguish sounds
and be able to process them
and understand the meaning behind them
or what they might represent.
The experience itself,
the sound of a bell,
the experience of seeing green,
the experience of heat or cold,
those are experiences
that are the most minimal
ones we can imagine.
And there's clearly an experience there.
There's clearly consciousness there
and it doesn't necessarily entail thought.
- [Narrator] What is your
biggest unanswered question?
- I guess the question for me is,
and this is the question
that I was left with
when I finished writing my book,
is, is it possible that consciousness
is a much more basic phenomenon in nature
and is essentially pervading everything,
so is much more like gravity
and so not that it's less
special than we assumed
because gravity is something
that's obviously very
special in our universe,
but it affects everything.
And the question that I'm
still very interested in
and think I'll probably
always be interested in
is does consciousness go deeper in nature
than the sciences have previously assumed?
So rather than arising
out of complex processing
in brains, namely,
is it possible that it's
a much more basic property
of the universe?
And so there are felt experiences
arising in more systems
and organisms than we previously realized.
- [Narrator] Could
consciousness be fundamental?
- So one of the things we
feel we need consciousness for
is our decision-making process.
And there's a sense
in which we feel like a
solid self making decisions
and we don't really get the
feeling that those decisions
are essentially a bottom brain processes
playing out in nature.
And I recently became very fascinated
by a couple of plant behavior studies.
One was of a pea seedling,
which in the lab they planted in a Y-maze.
So the pea seedling is planted at the top
and then the roots need to grow down
and then at a certain
point, it branches off,
and so the root actually needs to decide
which direction to grow,
which will be more
beneficial for it to grow in.
And they run different scenarios.
One is where they have a dish of water
at the end of one tube and
nothing at the end of the other.
And the root can sense that
there is water at one end.
And so at that decision point,
it senses the water
and it kind of makes a decision,
for lack of a better term,
to move toward the water.
And they do this experiment
in many interesting ways.
There's one where they actually
just play the sound of running water
and the root actually grows toward that.
And so the plants are,
while much simpler than human processing,
the plants are running through
a significant level of processing
to perceive its environment through sound,
through moisture, through chemicals.
And so there's this kind
of just simple decision
of which way the roots need to go.
And then you can go up one level
with this example of the dodder vine,
which is a parasitic vine.
And if you plant a dodder
vine between two plants,
one which is more conducive to
its thriving than the other,
it will move toward the plant
that is better suited for its needs.
And so the dodder vine
is a parasitic plant
that needs to wrap itself
around another plant
in order to survive.
One thing that's very
interesting about this
is scientists have recently discovered
that the dodder vine is
detecting the light waves
that are traveling through the leaves.
And so the reason we see
green when we look at a leaf
is because green is the frequency
that is bouncing off of the leaf
and the other light waves
are traveling through.
And so the dodder vine
actually has a way to
measure the type of light
that is coming out on the
other side of the leaves
and can measure and determine the shape,
the distance from the dodder vine
and determine which plant
it is better suited for
and grow in that direction in
order to get to that plant.
And so if you think about human behavior,
it's kind of a few
levels more complicated,
but it's very similar
and it's part of the same
category, if you will,
of decision making.
And of course the brain
is a very different system
from plants and from roots
and these other systems.
But when you look at
these types of behaviors,
it's not impossible to imagine
that there might be a felt sense,
however basic,
however fundamental, of
perceiving light waves,
of hearing the sound of running water,
of course not in our human way,
but again in a way that
we couldn't imagine
but still has a felt
experience associated with it.
And so, if it's possible
that we've been thinking about
consciousness the wrong way,
that it's not something
that arises out of complex processing
and it's something more basic,
something analogous to gravity
where it's more like a field,
something that's pervasive,
then we can imagine that all
types of processing in nature
could include some type
of felt experience.
- [Narrator] Part two:
Challenging our intuitions
on consciousness.
What are intuitions?
- So an intuition is
simply the strong feeling
that something is true,
but it may or may not
represent something accurate
about the world.
And we have many intuitions
that were sculpted by evolution
that are extremely useful.
If we're in a dangerous situation,
we can notice all kinds
of clues unconsciously
that a door was left a jar,
that an item is out of place,
that someone we're close to
who we don't know if
their pupils are dilated,
if their skin is flushed.
These can be signs that
someone is adrenalized
and about to act violently.
We may not notice any of
these elements subconsciously,
we just might be left with this intuition
that we feel like we're
in an unsafe situation
or that we shouldn't trust the person
who's standing next to us.
And those are extremely useful tools
that we use all the time,
we use them in making decisions.
There's studies that show
that our gut instincts
are often better guides
to making decisions about
which apartment to move into,
which job to take, then
deliberate logical reasoning.
But also intuitions can fail us
and they also fail us all the time.
And so, in the sciences there
are many examples of this
where there's just no reason for evolution
to have sculpted an intuition, again,
for being on an Earth that is a sphere.
It's not relevant to our everyday lives
and we feel like we're on a flat Earth.
And so, that's what our
intuition leads us to believe.
Einstein's theories of general relativity
and special relativity
gave us a whole new sense of
the structure of the universe
that space time is a
field that can be warped
and that warping is gravity.
And so rather than gravity
being a force like other forces,
what it actually is is
a warping of space time.
And these are things we do
not have intuitions for.
And when we learn them,
they help us form a truer view
of what the universe actually is.
- [Narrator] How do intuitions
impact our grasp of consciousness?
- So the study of
consciousness has largely,
if not entirely been
relegated to neuroscience,
which makes a lot of sense
because we have assumed in the sciences
and most modern people have assumed
that the organisms in the
world that are conscious,
that we are aware of,
and that we can kind of
confirm are conscious
are the ones that are most like us.
And we are complex systems,
the brain is the most complex system
in the universe that we know of.
And so we assume that consciousness
arises somehow out of
that complex processing.
But we have discovered a few things
that have actually flipped upside down
the assumptions that we began with.
So our assumption that we understand
what consciousness is
based on our intuitions,
some of these intuitions
that we're relying on
to make that assumption
have been overturned
by modern neuroscience
and have been shown to be illusions.
And so in many cases, we're
being led by illusions.
And this is something
that's very interesting
and that has not yet really sunk
into the larger scientific culture.
And so, if we want to ask this question
about whether consciousness
goes deeper in nature
than we have previously assumed,
the sciences that this will
pertain to to biology perhaps,
perhaps plant behavior,
even though that sounds crazy,
we may find that there are
some minimal felt experiences
in the complex behavior of plants,
or even deeper, these other sciences,
the science of physics
and botany and biology
need to be better informed
of the neuroscience
and what we've learned
about the brain so far
so that they can have a better grasp
of the way certain illusions
might be misleading them.
And so that if they have
intuitions about consciousness,
this is something that was
really taboo to think about
or talk about not that long ago,
but it's useful for any scientist
who is interested in
studying consciousness
in a new and creative and different way
or thinking about consciousness
in a different way,
it's important for them to be aware
of some of the neuroscience
that helps support that view
and that can give many
scientists good reason
to start thinking a little bit differently
about consciousness,
a little more creatively
about consciousness.
And this is really how paradigm
shifts happen in science.
And the truth is this is a huge part
of the scientific process
in almost every regard.
When we challenge our intuitions,
because we're facing new evidence
that is counterintuitive,
which is most often the case,
especially, as I said,
for these paradigm shifts,
for groundbreaking theories,
they get us to see the
world that we live in
in a significantly different way.
So if you think about
all of the major scientific breakthroughs,
all of the major paradigm shifts,
so understanding that
the Earth is a sphere
and not flat as our intuitions
originally led us to believe.
People forget how counterintuitive
this discovery was
and it was made based on
celestial observations
and this is kind of, this
is how science works.
So we get this evidence that
it's not the way we felt it was
or the way we thought it was,
and then there's a period of time
where we're wrestling with our intuitions.
And this is an important part
of the scientific process
because our intuitions are
often very good guides.
And so it's good that
we keep checking to see,
is this new information actually accurate?
And then when the scientific
evidence is overwhelming,
we're then in a process of
shifting our intuitions,
of starting to feel
that we live on a sphere
in a solar system orbiting the sun
rather than the other way around.
And it starts to shift the
way we feel in the world,
it shifts our concepts of
our everyday experience.
But then of course
it also then shapes the
science that is to come.
So, and there are other examples of this,
discovering the microscopic world
and the germ theory of disease,
understanding that microscopic things
that we have no intuition for,
we can't touch or taste or feel
or experience them in any way,
but we've now discovered they're real
and they cause disease
and they can kill you.
This was, again, highly
counterintuitive to people
when the evidence started to arrive
and it was resisted for a long time,
and there's this period
of shifting intuitions
and accepting new evidence and new data
and then eventually forming
an entirely new view of
the world that we live in.
And so I think we're at a point like that
in consciousness studies right now.
And so I think there's
a lot that's happened
in modern neuroscience
that suggests that our intuitions
about consciousness are wrong
and they give us tools
for shaking our intuitions
and playing around with this question
of whether are the intuitions
that have driven our
assumptions about consciousness,
whether they're not entirely accurate,
and whether we need to spend
more time shifting intuitions
and challenging intuitions
in order to think more creatively
and maybe come up with some new theories
about what consciousness might be
and how far down in nature it might go.
- [Narrator] How do we challenge
our intuitions on consciousness?
- So when we're trying
to think more clearly
and more creatively about consciousness,
in order to start to challenge
some of these intuitions
that could be illusions
or ones that we know to be illusions,
I always like to start
with these two questions
and there are two questions
that I think really get at the heart
of where these intuitions
are misleading us.
Number one, is there any evidence
we can find from outside an
organism or outside a system
that will conclusively tell us
that that organism entails
conscious experiences?
Is there anything we can point to
where we can definitively say, yes,
that organism is conscious?
And the second question
is related and similar,
but it comes at this intuition
from a slightly different angle.
And the second question is,
is consciousness doing something?
Does it serve a function?
Is it driving our behavior in
the way that we feel it is?
And our intuitive answer
to both of these questions
is a resounding yes.
I think if I go to pick up
my friend at the airport
who I haven't seen in years
and I see her running
toward me looking excited,
those all seem like
conclusive evidence to me
that consciousness is, that
she's conscious of course.
And regarding the second question
is that obviously of course
our conscious experiences
are affecting things.
It seems that even in order to decide
what I want for breakfast,
I have to consult my conscious desires
and that it's the feeling of what I want
that then drives the decision.
So our intuitive answer
to both of these questions
is a resounding yes,
but surprisingly it's easier
to puncture these intuitions
or to shake them up than you might think.
- [Narrator] Can consciousness
exist without physical signs?
- One thing that's important to point out
is that we know it's possible
for there to be no behavior
coming out of a system,
nothing to detect from the outside
when there's a full human
conscious experience present.
So already this starts
to shift our intuitions
and this can be seen in two conditions.
One is called locked-in syndrome
and the other is anesthesia awareness.
And they're essentially the same state
relative to consciousness.
So locked-in syndrome is
something that happens
to someone whose brain has become injured
due to a stroke or physical injury
and they have become completely paralyzed
so they can no longer move
any part of their body,
yet they still have a
full conscious experience.
They can see, they can
hear, they can think.
And there's an interesting
and famous example of someone
with locked-in syndrome.
He was a writer for French "Elle,"
his name was Jean-Dominique
Bauby and he was in this state,
although he was lucky, he
had one point of mobility,
he was able to move his left eyelid
and somehow his caretakers
were able to notice
that he seemed to be trying
to move his left eyelid.
And over time they
developed this technique
for him spelling out words with
certain patterns of blinks.
And he ended up writing a beautiful memoir
titled "The Diving-Bell
and the Butterfly."
It's a great example of
a person, an organism,
a system in nature
that is having such a
full conscious experience,
as full as I am having right now
with the ability to write
and experience the world,
but with no ability to move or communicate
or exhibit any behavior
that would tell us that
this person is conscious.
And so we can wonder if it's possible
that there are other systems in nature
that simply aren't able to communicate
or exhibit behavior that convinces us
that consciousness is present in them.
- [Narrator] Is consciousness
necessary for behavior?
- So the second question
is whether consciousness
is behind our behavior,
is driving our behavior, is causal.
And here we can use the example of fear.
So the fear response is something
that we really have a strong intuition
is something that is useful
and evolved for a purpose.
We imagine that if we encounter a bear
or a lion in the wild,
that the feeling of fear
is the thing that gets us to
move so quickly out of the way,
to act quickly, to save our lives.
But what we now understand about the brain
is that the experience of feeling fear
is actually something that happens
at the tail end of a
sequence of processing
and that our bodies begin responding
and moving to a dangerous situation
much more quickly than
we become aware of it.
And so our conscious experience
of those types of emotions
actually lag behind the physical world.
So binding processes take
in all of our perceptions,
all of the information
that comes in through our
eyes and ears through touch,
and give us an experience
of a present moment.
So I often give the example
of playing the piano.
So if you press down on a piano key,
you'll have the experience
of feeling the key move down,
at the same moment that
you see the key move down,
and in the same moment
that you hear the tone,
when in actuality all of these signals
actually move through the
world at different rates,
they take different amounts
of time to get to your brain,
they each take different amounts of time
to be processed by the brain.
And so what the brain does then
is weave all of these signals together.
And what your conscious experience is
is of all of these things
happening in the same moment
when in actuality they're
happening at different times.
And so those intuitions
that consciousness is driving
that type of behavior,
we now know to be incorrect.
- [Narrator] What might be revealed
if we're wrong about consciousness?
- So if the intuitions
that led us to assume
that consciousness arises
out of complex processing,
namely in brains are misleading us,
we really have only two
options for a starting place.
So when we look out at
all of the organisms
and structures in the universe
and we ask ourselves which of
these collections of matter
contain conscious experiences
or give rise to conscious experiences,
in the most basic sense
because we don't yet know,
in the most basic sense
the answer has to be all or some.
We know the answer isn't none
because we have evidence of
our own conscious experiences,
we know they arise at least
one point in space and time.
And so the sciences have assumed so far
that the answer is some
and that it's very likely
that they only arise in systems
that are very similar to ours
and very likely only
in systems with brains.
And I'm very glad that we did
start with that assumption
and it's always been
my assumption as well.
I think it was the most
fruitful path forward,
given the knowledge that we have so far.
But given the fact that
some of these intuitions
we now know are misleading us,
if we start with this other assumption
that all of these systems are conscious,
that consciousness is
fundamental, what would that mean?
And what kinds of questions would we ask
and how could we even study
something like this scientifically?
So there are a few questions
that come to mind for me
that would be so interesting
to move forward with.
One is, which types of
systems entail suffering?
That's something we would wanna know.
In terms of ethics,
this is something we
obviously care a lot about
between human beings and
also as we have learned
that other animals are conscious,
it's important for us
to extend our ethical
intuitions toward them.
We know now that when
dogs cry out in pain,
they're feeling something
very similar to what we feel.
And so it'd be interesting to learn
what other types of systems
might experience pain or suffering.
I think another interesting
avenue of research
is would it be possible to
share conscious experiences
and would we be able
to learn more about the universe that way?
So in some future science
that is very hard to imagine,
if there would be some way
to encode a memory of another system
and place it in my brain
so that it becomes part
of my stream of memory,
I could have a memory
of being another system
and maybe a system that we
want to learn more about
or know more about.
I've often thought how
impactful it would be
if scientists could
share their intuitions,
their very insightful intuitions.
If you think about Albert Einstein
and the fact that he had
intuitions for space time
that no other human being had,
and it took him more than a decade
to explain this intuition
through mathematics and language
and to be able to communicate
what he was talking about
to other scientists,
let alone start to make
scientific progress with it.
From the moment he had that intuition
to the moment he was able to
share it was many, many years.
And I often wonder, is
there some future science
where you might be able to
actually share that intuition?
And so I call this
potential future science,
experiential science,
and I think it's one of
the places we might go,
however crazy it sounds now,
if we discover or have good enough reason
to believe that consciousness
is actually much more pervasive
than we thought it was.
So like other paradigm shifts,
if we could prove
that consciousness does in
fact run deeper in nature,
it's hard to imagine,
human beings have a hard time imagining
what the future will look like,
but no doubt it will change
the way we feel in the world.
Recently when I was doing plant research,
I went for a jog on this hiking trail
and I actually ran this little
thought experiment for myself
imagining that all the
plants along the trail
were not plants but were creatures,
so were small insects and small animals.
And I was just doing this
to see if I could change
my intuition about
what might entail conscious experiences.
And so I was going on this jog
essentially imagining
that plants don't exist,
but that all these plants I was seeing
were some type of creature
feeling the world,
moving through the world.
And just that little
exercise gave me a sense
of how different we
might feel in the world
if we understood that there
were many more conscious systems
around us than we realized.
- [Narrator] Part three:
Debunking the illusion of self.
What is the illusion of self?
- People often think that illusions
are evolved for their usefulness,
but the truth is that most illusions
that we experience are actually glitches.
They're ways the brain works
so that we can accurately
navigate the world we live in.
So when I talk about the illusion of self,
this is often very hard for people
to grasp what that could even mean.
I'm obviously a person over here
and you're a person over there
and we talk about ourselves
all the time and what we do
and how we spend our days and
our histories and our futures.
And so I first like to
just be very clear about
what I'm not talking about
when I talk about the illusion of self.
And all of those things
that I just included
are obviously things we can call a self,
we can talk about our
autobiographical histories,
we can talk about things we tend to do,
our likes and dislikes,
and all of that is in the
description of a self,
and that makes perfect sense
and that piece of it is not an illusion.
And so we can talk about ourselves
in the same way that
we can talk about a cat
as another organism in nature,
or we can label a wave
as a system in nature.
And the truth is that the
experience of being a self
is actually much more
analogous to an ocean wave
than to something static
in nature like a rock.
And so this starts to get
at what I am talking about
when I talk about the illusion of self.
And so in the same way
that an ocean wave is a process
in nature, it's dynamic,
it's ever changing,
even though we can label it a wave
and we can call it a wave
and talk about the types
of things waves do,
we all understand
that a wave is not a static
thing in nature, it's a process.
And our brains are very
much the same thing,
they are processes in nature
that are ever changing, ever evolving.
And so all of our experiences
take place across time
and are continually arising
so that if I became unconscious
or if something happened to my brain,
immediately my experiences would change.
And the truth is that our experiences
are changing all the time in every moment
and we're in fact in dialogue
with the external world
in every moment too.
So the sense that we are a solid entity,
an unchanging entity
that exists someplace in our body
and takes ownership of our body
and even ownership of our brain
rather than being identical to our brain,
which we know to be the case,
that is where the illusion lies.
And this illusion confuses
us about our place in nature
and the state of reality
on many different levels.
And so on one level it blinds us
to the fact that we are
in constant communication
with the external world
and that the boundaries between ourselves
and the world and ourselves and each other
are not as solid and
firm as they appear to us
or that they feel to us to be,
especially when we feel
like a static self.
And I often wish that these connections
were made visual to us.
I think we'd have a better sense
of how we exist in the world
if we could actually see certain things.
So if you could see the sound waves
moving from my mouth to your eardrum
and the effect that was
having on your eardrum
and then the subsequent
processing in your brain
and how that was making you feel.
If we could see the air molecules
going in and out of my mouth,
if when you're in a room full of people,
you could see the air being shared
by everyone in the room
and the microorganisms,
and there's so many levels
to our interconnection
into the ways that
we're embedded in nature
that would give us a visceral sense
that we aren't actually
embedded in nature,
but we are nature,
we are a part of this
thing we call the universe.
We're not separate from it.
And so there are many reasons
why it's useful to notice this illusion.
There's some psychological reasons,
there's psychological benefits
to human beings being more in touch
with the way in which we
are processes in nature
constantly communicating
and interacting with the outside world,
whether that's through air,
water, food, chemicals,
or whether that's through
ideas with each other.
If someone came into the studio right now
and said, "We all have to get
out of here, there's a fire,"
just those words, just the
sound waves against my eardrum
and then the subsequent
processing in my brain,
there would be an instantaneous
physiological change
in my body just hearing those words,
likely even before I consciously process
what they were saying,
I would probably be moving out of my chair
before I even really processed
the whole meaning of
what those words meant.
And so there's a way
in which there's a psychological benefit
to understanding this illusion of self
because the illusion of
self often contributes
to our feelings separate from the world,
separate from each other,
feeling very isolated.
And it's also useful for
thinking about consciousness
because our intuitions tell us
that this feeling of being a solid self
is equivalent to consciousness itself.
And this is certainly an
illusion that's misleading us.
- [Narrator] What brain processes
create the illusion of self?
- So the neuroscience is
really still in its infancy,
but we're starting to learn more and more
about how this illusion
of self gets created.
The neuroscientist Anil Seth
wrote a book called "Being You,"
which gives a wonderful
and thorough description
of how this experience
of self gets created.
Part of it has to do with
something called change blindness,
which we know about in vision,
we have a blind spot in our visual field
that we are not conscious
of, that we don't detect.
And neuroscientists are just
now starting to understand
that there is a change blindness
with respect to our experience over time
so that we don't notice
how different each of our experiences
in every moment are from every other.
And so that adds to this illusion
of being a solid entity that
moves through time unchanged.
We're also learning a little bit more
about what neuroscientists refer to
as the Default Mode Network.
So we know that when the
Default Mode Network is active,
we are highly aware of
this illusion of self
and it tends to quiet down
when we're experiencing
what people talk about as a flow state.
So when we're very immersed in our work,
if we're very immersed in a sport.
When we are not so aware of
self versus other
or self versus world.
We also know through
some studies using fMRI,
functional MRI machines,
when people are using
various meditation techniques
that quiet down the Default Mode Network,
they report experiences of feeling more
at one with the universe.
They report experiences of no
longer feeling like a self,
no longer feeling the
boundary between themselves
and the rest of the world.
This is also something that happens
when people are under the influence
of some psychedelic substances.
In an fMRI machine we can see
that the Default Mode Network
has quieted down
and people report very
similar experiences.
So this experience that people have
when the Default Mode
Network is quieted down
and they've dropped this experience
of being a solid self
is actually much more in line
with what we know the
underlying reality to be,
which is an endlessly fluctuating process
that gives rise to each new
present moment we experience
and is much more
analogous to an ocean wave
as a phenomenon in nature
rather than a static thing.
And we also know that memory plays a role
in creating this
experience of self as well.
There's a sense in which
all of the memories
that we have access to over time
were being experienced
by the same subject,
by the same self.
And you can imagine if your
memories weren't strung together
and your experience was
just of each present moment,
there'd be much less of a sense of a self
moving through time.
And something similar happens
in a practice like meditation
where one is focusing on experiences
arising in the present
moment, one after the other
without getting lost in
thoughts about the future
or thoughts about the past.
And we now know also from
studies of meditators
that have been put in fMRI machines
that when someone is in a
concentrated state of meditation
attempting to stay focused
on the present moment,
this also quiets the default mode network
and people regularly report
dropping this illusion of self.
- [Narrator] Is it useful to
recognize the illusion of self?
- So some people find
this idea that the self
is an illusion to be
somewhat destabilizing
or disconcerting, which
I completely understand,
but the truth is that there really
is this positive way to view it.
And feeling more in touch
with our interconnectedness
is one way that it can be
framed in a very positive sense
and that give people a
true sense of wellbeing.
And the other thing to keep in mind
is that there are certainly
levels of usefulness
for being aware of illusions.
So one example I like to give
is that the Earth is a sphere.
We more or less walk around
with the illusion that the Earth is flat
and we act as though the earth is flat,
and that's the best way to
go about our everyday lives.
If we constantly reminded ourselves
that the Earth is a sphere
and had to keep that in mind
and had to feel that
way everywhere we went,
it would just be an annoying distraction
and would get in the way
of all kinds of activities
and would not be helpful.
And the same is true of
the illusion of self.
Throughout our day in most
of our daily activities,
trying to remember that this
experience is an illusion,
is really just a distraction
and completely unnecessary.
But if we wanna think more
clearly about consciousness,
it's very useful.
And especially when we're
studying consciousness
through science,
this is an important
illusion to keep in mind.
And if we're trying to be more in touch
with the interconnected nature of things
or if we're practicing
something like meditation,
it's extremely useful to
be aware of this illusion.
- Part four: The illusion of free will.
How do you define free will?
- So I think that free will
for the most part is an illusion.
But when I talk about free will,
I like to distinguish between
conscious will and free will
because the illusion is really
contained in this feeling
that it's the consciousness
that is the will.
So I use the term free will
to talk about decision-making
processes in nature,
which there clearly are
and I'm happy to call that free will,
although in the end I'm not sure
how free those processes are.
But there's this decision-making process
that humans experience
at a very complex level.
But you can see simpler versions
of this in nature as well.
So if you look at something
like a pea tendril,
when it senses that it's close to a branch
that it can wrap itself around,
it starts growing more
quickly in that direction
and then it changes the growth
so that it wraps itself around a branch.
There is a very simple
form of decision-making
that goes into that process.
The pea tendril needs to
sense the branch nearby,
it also needs to be in the light
for this process to take place.
So there are many elements to this moment
where the pea tendril decides
to move in a certain direction
to start growing more
quickly and to start coiling.
Most of us wouldn't consider that
to be a free decision-making process.
It's a cause and effect
process that occurs in nature.
And as you move up in complexity
to the level of brains
and then human brains,
the number of factors that come into play
are so expansive
that it would be impossible
for us to track them all.
So the state of the brain
at any given moment,
the interaction with the outside world,
the set of beliefs that brain has,
I mean this list goes on and on and on.
And if you're talking
about a complex decision,
you know, there could be a simple decision
whether to pick up a
glass of water or not,
whether to change your
position in your chair
or something much more complex
about a job you've been offered
and you're trying to figure
out whether to take it or not.
There are so many elements
that are taking place in
this process in nature
that it would be impossible to track,
but it is a process
and it's a process by which the brain
is interacting with the exterior world
and measuring the different outcomes
of the different possible futures
and then ultimately making a decision.
This is something that I think
we can refer to as free will
and that what many
people mean by free will.
The problem with having free in the title
is that it's not free in
the way we feel it is.
And this is where the illusion comes in.
And so we begin with
this illusion of self,
of being this solid concrete entity
that lives somewhere in the head.
And even though we know better,
feels as though it's separate
from the physical world
and that this self can kind of swoop in
and change the course of history
or somehow make decisions
that are free of the physical
world that we're embedded in.
And that I think is clearly an illusion.
And I call that conscious will
because it is this feeling
that my conscious experience is this self
and is the thing that has this freedom.
- [Narrator] How can the
illusion of free will
be challenged?
- There was a very
interesting study done in 2013
in which they put participants
in an fMRI machine
and showed them a screen
and presented two numbers on that screen
and they gave them the
option of either adding
or subtracting these two numbers
and they were scanning the activity
of these participants' brains
while they were doing this calculation.
And the result of this study
was that based on the
information from the MRI,
the experimenters could
tell up to four seconds
not only when this person was
going to make the decision,
but whether they decided
to add or subtract.
So there've been other studies like this
that are also interesting,
but in my view,
these studies aren't actually
necessary to prove the point.
Based on the neuroscience
we currently have,
we should expect to get more
and more results like this,
but even if we didn't,
if you pay close attention
to your moment-to-moment experience
and you don't have to be a meditator,
but watching the mind make a decision,
you get the sense viscerally
that there's no self or free will
making decisions behind the scenes.
But that in terms of your
conscious experience,
a decision really arises.
And so you can do this simple exercise,
just give yourself the
option of moving your big toe
or moving your pointer finger
and, you know, in the next 30 seconds
decide to either move your
toe or your pointer finger.
And if you kind of rest in
your conscious experience,
you will notice that that decision
simply arises in your conscious awareness.
There's no self who's
deciding to make the decision.
- [Narrator] Is recognizing
the illusion of free will beneficial?
- So, many people find this realization
to be quite disconcerting,
which is understandable.
And I think one way to address
that is levels of usefulness.
And the vast majority of the time
it is not useful or helpful
to realize that there's an
illusion of sorts taking place.
There are places where it's useful,
it's useful obviously for the
sciences and for neuroscience,
but it actually can also
be useful psychologically
in certain circumstances.
And again, this isn't something
you wanna remind yourself
of in every moment,
but there are moments where realizing
that there's an experience of
conscious will taking place
can be quite liberating.
And there are a few examples here.
So one is many people get stuck
in feeling responsible for
their psychological state.
And there's a way in which simply being
with whatever uncomfortable
emotions you're experiencing,
whether it's sadness or
frustration or anger,
and being aware that those
processes are playing out
and being with them rather than believing
that you are controlling them
can be extremely beneficial
for psychological wellbeing.
There are also ways that we can apply this
in our relationships with other people.
I sometimes talk about the fact
that you would never
get angry at a tornado
and that doesn't mean anger
doesn't have a place
in society and culture,
but there are times when
anger can overcome us
and start to rule our lives in a way
that is incredibly
unhelpful and unhealthy.
And there isn't a solid self
to every person that is
somehow evil or worthy of blame
can also be liberating to
notice in certain circumstances.
This realization certainly doesn't mean
that people shouldn't be held
responsible for their actions,
but it might actually inform wiser ways
of dealing with people who act violently
or people who cause harm.
And sometimes I draw the analogy to AI
or something like a self-driving car.
If a self-driving car
hit someone accidentally,
we would want to understand
the mechanics of that.
We would want to understand
whether something had gone wrong
with the software or the programming.
And so I think there are places in society
and in our relationships
where blame and anger
and punishment aren't necessarily useful.
And so being aware of this
could potentially inform
wiser policy-making.
