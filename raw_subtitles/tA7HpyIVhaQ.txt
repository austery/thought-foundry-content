From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Michael


Bubaro.
 This
 is
 the
 daily.


The
 question
 of
 what
 to
 do
 about


undocumented
 immigrants
 has
 long
 bonded


President
 Trump
 to
 his
 supporters.
 So


much
 so
 that
 an
 overwhelming
 majority
 of


them
 back
 his
 allout
 crackdown
 over
 the


past
 year.


But
 then
 came
 the
 extraordinary
 events


of
 the
 past
 few
 weeks
 in
 Minneapolis


where
 federal
 agents
 killed
 two
 American


citizens
 in
 the
 streets.
 Suddenly,
 two


of
 the
 MAGA
 movement's
 biggest


priorities,
 fighting
 illegal
 immigration


and
 fighting
 government
 overreach
 were


colliding
 in
 the
 most
 vivid
 way


imaginable.


Today
 we
 speak
 with
 Trump
 voters
 about


how
 they're
 making
 sense
 of
 that
 clash


and
 how
 in
 some
 cases
 it's
 fundamentally


changing
 their
 view
 of
 the
 president.


It's
 Monday,
 February
 9th.


Hello.


>> Hi,
 this
 is
 Caitlyn
 calling
 from
 the
 New


York
 Times.
 How
 are
 you?


>> Hi,
 my
 name
 is
 Jessica
 Chung
 and
 we
 met


a
 while
 ago
 around
 the
 Maricopa


Republicans
 office.


>> Over
 the
 past
 few
 weeks,
 as
 tensions
 in


Minnesota
 ramped
 up,
 Daily
 Producers


Caitlyn
 O'Keeffe
 and
 Jessica
 Chung
 spoke


with
 over
 a
 dozen
 people
 who
 voted
 for


Donald
 Trump
 in
 the
 last
 election.


>> I'm
 in
 Massachusetts.


>> Oh,
 you
 are?
 I'm
 in
 my
 garage
 talking
 to


you
 right
 now.
 I'm
 smoking
 a
 cigar
 while


we're
 having
 this
 conversation.


>> Nice.
 Wow.


>> For
 many
 of
 them,
 immigration
 had
 been
 a


major
 reason
 for
 that
 vote.


>> I
 remember
 they
 painted
 the
 picture
 that


there
 was
 a
 large
 caravan.
 That's
 what


they
 called
 it.


>> A
 continuous
 flow
 of
 migrant
 caravans


coming
 up.
 That
 was
 my
 impression
 is


that
 people
 were
 coming
 over
 in
 droves


>> and
 it
 looked
 like
 there
 was
 10,
 20,


30,000
 people
 or
 more


>> and
 then
 they
 were
 like,
 "Oh
 yeah,
 you


know,
 there's
 all
 these
 Chinese
 people


coming
 through
 the
 border."
 Like
 it
 was


just
 like
 random
 things
 you
 would
 hear


and
 you're
 like,
 "Wait,
 what?
 What
 is


going
 on?"


>> And
 from
 the
 moment
 Trump
 was
 sworn
 in


for
 a
 second
 term,
 they
 were
 impressed


with
 just
 how
 quickly
 and
 decisively
 he


took
 action
 to
 close
 the
 border.


>> Oh,
 I
 think
 he
 did
 a
 fantastic
 job
 with


it.
 This
 is
 absolutely
 extraordinary.


>> And
 he
 just
 used
 existing
 laws.
 He
 said,


"Okay,
 borders
 closed."


>> We
 went
 from
 being
 invaded
 on
 a
 daily


basis
 to
 borders
 where
 law
 and
 order


prevailed.


>> We
 keep
 hearing
 people
 talk
 about
 how


the
 immigration
 system's
 broken.


>> Well,
 the
 immigration
 laws
 are
 broken.


Yet,
 in
 fact,
 we
 discovered
 that
 was
 not


true.


>> It's
 not
 broken.
 It's
 just
 not
 enforced.


>> You
 just
 simply
 need
 to
 enforce
 them.


What
 a
 novel
 concept.


Once
 they
 closed
 the
 border,
 then
 the


next
 step
 was
 to
 get
 people
 out
 that


came
 in
 illegally.


>> In
 practice,
 that
 meant
 deploying


thousands
 of
 federal
 agents
 into
 the


streets
 of
 American
 cities.


It
 meant
 huge
 protests
 against
 ICE
 and


Border
 Patrol.


The
 National
 Guard
 going
 into


neighborhoods,


detentions
 at
 courouses,


and
 federal
 agents
 showing
 up
 at


workplaces,
 at
 stores,
 and
 near
 schools.


It's
 still
 really
 scary
 to
 see
 our


friends
 and
 teachers
 get
 um
 teargassed.


Were
 you
 at
 the
 school?


>> At
 that
 point,
 some
 of
 Trump's
 voters


began
 to
 rethink
 their
 support
 for
 the


president's
 plan.


They're
 grabbing
 kids
 or
 they're


grabbing
 US
 citizens,
 detaining
 them,


and
 putting
 them
 in
 the
 back
 of
 the
 van


and
 not
 giving
 them
 reasonable
 suspicion


as
 to
 why
 they're
 being
 taken
 away.


>> I
 did
 not
 know
 that
 things
 like
 that


would
 happen.
 People
 that
 are
 doing
 this


the
 legal
 way,
 that
 are
 going
 to
 the


immigration
 office
 to
 take
 care
 of
 a


lapse
 of
 paperwork
 or
 the
 next
 step
 in


their
 process
 to
 become
 a
 citizen.


>> This
 is
 wrong.
 The
 way
 they're
 going


about
 this
 is
 inhumane
 and
 I
 don't


support
 it.
 I
 was
 like,
 I
 want
 to
 go
 and


step
 up
 and
 do
 what
 I
 can
 and
 protest


and
 be
 with
 my
 fellow
 humanity.


>> And
 then
 an
 ICE
 agent
 shot
 and
 killed
 a


US
 citizen.


>> The
 most
 recent
 situation
 that
 happened


with
 Renee
 Good
 was
 an
 unbelievable


eyeopener
 to
 what
 was
 going
 on
 and
 how


this
 administration
 was
 going
 to
 handle


things
 moving
 forward.
 That
 was
 a
 kind


of
 wakeup
 call
 for
 people
 like
 Chris


Stinett
 in
 Lexington,
 Kentucky,
 and


Carter
 Brown
 in
 Atlanta,
 Georgia.


>> I
 told
 someone
 close
 to
 me
 that
 like


that
 could
 have
 been
 any
 of
 us.
 And
 her


reply
 back
 to
 me
 was,
 "Well,
 I'd
 hope


you'd
 have
 more
 sense
 than
 to
 ever
 be
 at


somewhere
 like
 that."


>> They
 even
 started
 to
 wonder,
 "Could
 that


have
 been
 me
 or
 a
 member
 of
 my
 family?"


>> At
 first,
 I
 didn't
 know
 her
 race.
 It
 It


broke
 me.
 And
 then
 to
 find
 out
 that
 she


was
 white
 afterwards,
 it
 scared
 me
 even


more.


>> Does
 your
 wife
 also
 feel
 similarly?


>> Oh,
 100%.
 She's
 been
 very
 upset.
 She's


37
 and
 so
 that
 resonates
 with
 her
 a


little
 bit
 because
 Renee
 Good
 was
 37


>> and
 she's
 also
 a
 mom.


>> They
 had
 believed
 that
 Trump's


enforcement
 actions
 would
 focus
 on
 the


worst
 of
 the
 worst,
 people
 who
 had
 a


record
 of
 committing
 violent
 crimes.


This
 wasn't
 that.


Both
 Carter
 and
 Chris,
 who
 supported


Donald
 Trump
 in
 the
 last
 three


presidential
 elections,
 now
 say
 that


they
 regret
 their
 vote.


>> People
 hate
 that
 I
 use
 the
 word


bamboozled,
 but
 that's
 the
 best
 way
 that


I
 can
 describe
 how
 I
 feel
 on
 the
 outside


looking
 in.
 You
 know,
 you're
 like,
 it


was
 an
 open
 book
 test.
 Everything
 was


right
 there.


The
 community
 that
 I
 just
 left,
 many
 of


them
 have
 don't
 tread
 on
 me
 flags


flying.
 But
 you
 know
 what
 their
 reply


back
 to
 what
 happened
 with
 Renee
 is?


Just
 comply.


So
 what
 is
 it?
 Don't
 tread
 on
 me
 or
 just


comply.


>> If
 we
 remove
 everybody,


how
 many
 more
 people
 will
 die
 along
 the


way?


But
 of
 course,
 not
 everyone
 with


misgivings
 regrets
 their
 vote
 for
 Trump.


For
 some
 of
 them,
 it's
 more
 complicated.


Caitlyn
 O'Keeffe
 reached
 one
 such
 voter


in
 Minnesota.


>> Can
 I
 just
 have
 you
 introduce
 yourself?


>> Yeah,
 I
 am
 Wilk
 Wilkinson.
 Uh,


>> a
 couple
 weeks
 ago,
 I
 called
 Wilk


Wilkinson.
 He's
 50
 years
 old
 and
 he


lives
 about
 40
 miles
 outside
 of


Minneapolis
 near
 Clear
 Water.


>> Grew
 up
 uh
 working
 in
 restaurants,


working
 construction,
 truck
 driving,


very
 kind
 of
 a
 bluecollar
 atmosphere.


>> He
 says
 the
 populist
 message
 of
 the


right
 resonated
 with
 him.


>> I
 uh
 I
 voted
 for
 Donald
 Trump
 in
 2016


and
 2020
 and
 2024.


>> Now
 he
 works
 for
 a
 nonprofit
 that
 aims


to
 bridge
 political
 divides.
 I
 wanted
 to


understand
 how
 he
 was
 thinking
 about
 the


battle
 over
 immigration
 enforcement


going
 on
 in
 his
 home
 state.


>> I
 agree
 fully
 with
 the
 idea
 that
 we
 have


far
 too
 many
 people
 in
 this
 country
 who


came
 here
 illegally
 and
 have
 not
 done


things
 the
 right
 way
 and
 we
 we
 are
 a


nation
 of
 laws
 and
 those
 laws
 have
 to
 be


upheld.
 But
 there
 is
 also
 a
 right
 way
 to


do
 things
 in
 a
 wrong
 way.
 When
 the
 news


broke
 on
 January
 24th
 that
 federal


agents
 had
 killed
 a
 man
 in
 Minneapolis


named
 Alex
 Prey,
 Will
 went
 looking
 for


the
 video.


>> You
 know,
 when
 I
 initially
 saw
 the
 first


video
 and
 then
 I
 heard
 the
 narrative


coming
 out
 of
 Secretary
 of
 Homeland


Security
 Christy
 Gnome,


>> I
 do
 want
 to
 address
 the
 tragic


situation
 that
 we
 saw
 in
 Minneapolis


today
 that
 unfolded
 on
 the
 streets.
 It


occurred
 uh
 with
 DHS
 law
 enforcement
 as


they
 carried
 out
 their
 lawful
 duties
 to


keep
 Americans
 safe
 in


>> I
 heard
 her
 say
 what
 she
 said.
 This


individual
 went
 and
 impeded
 their
 law


enforcement
 operations,
 attacked
 those


officers,
 had
 a
 weapon
 on
 him
 and


multiple
 dozens
 of
 rounds
 of
 ammunition


wishing
 to
 inflict
 harm
 on
 these


officers
 coming
 brandishing
 like
 that


and
 impeding
 their
 work
 that
 they
 were


doing.
 We'll
 continue.
 The
 first
 thing


that
 I
 was
 looking
 for
 was
 any
 way
 that


it
 could
 be
 considered,
 you
 know,


brandishing
 a
 firearm
 because
 that
 was


the
 immediate
 narrative
 that
 came
 out.


I'm
 like,
 I've
 got
 to
 see
 if
 I'm
 missing


something.
 Is
 there
 something
 happening


here
 that
 I
 am
 not
 seeing?
 I
 watched


every
 single
 video
 that
 I
 think
 is


online.
 I
 watched
 it
 several
 times.
 I


dropped
 it
 into
 my
 software,
 slowed
 it


down,
 sped
 it
 up,
 trying
 to
 make
 it
 all


make
 sense.
 and
 uh
 saw
 immediately
 that


it
 was
 an
 outright
 fabrication
 on
 the


part
 of
 Christy
 Gnome,
 unfortunately.


And
 and
 I'm
 like,
 this
 is
 awful.
 Awful.


And
 I
 was
 so
 disappointed.
 I
 I
 got
 to
 be


honest,
 cuz
 I
 was
 a
 huge
 Christy
 Gnome


fan
 when
 she
 was
 the
 governor
 of
 South


Dakota.


But
 then
 I
 think
 what
 was
 more


disappointing
 was
 they
 stuck
 to
 it
 and


then
 it
 instantly
 became
 tribalized.


people
 went
 to
 their
 side,
 went
 to
 their


silos
 and
 started
 excusing
 things
 that


they
 would
 never,
 ever,
 ever
 otherwise


excuse
 was
 the
 biggest
 heartbreak
 for
 me


personally.


>> Another
 thing
 that
 concerned
 Wilk
 was


the
 Trump
 administration
 coming
 out


after
 the
 shooting,
 saying
 that
 it
 was


unlawful
 for
 Pretty
 to
 bring
 a
 gun
 to
 a


protest.
 As
 Christie
 said,
 you
 cannot


bring
 a
 firearm
 loaded
 with
 multiple


magazines
 to
 any
 sort
 of
 protest
 that


you
 want.
 It's
 that
 simple.
 You
 don't


have
 that
 right
 to
 break
 the
 law.


>> I
 mean,
 I
 I
 will
 say
 this,
 Kaitlin,
 I'm


a
 concealed
 carrier.
 You
 know,
 I'm
 a


Second
 Amendment
 absolutist.
 I,
 you


know,
 I've
 been
 around
 guns
 literally
 my


whole
 life.
 And
 was
 he
 allowed
 to
 carry


a
 gun
 where
 he
 was
 by
 law?
 Yes,
 he
 was.


Cash
 Patel,
 the
 FBI
 director,
 was


clearly
 wrong
 about
 stating
 what
 he


stated.
 Christy
 Gnome
 was
 clearly
 wrong


about
 stating
 what
 she
 stated.
 The
 fact


that
 they
 play
 so
 fast
 and
 loose
 with


making
 statements
 like
 that
 when
 they


were
 clearly
 wrong
 says
 yes,
 the
 Second


Amendment
 is
 in
 danger
 of
 being
 violated


by
 this
 administration.
 Now,
 was
 it


smart
 that
 Alex
 Freddy
 was
 armed
 while


he
 was
 doing
 what
 he
 was
 doing?
 No,
 not


at
 all.
 It
 was
 a
 very,
 very,
 very
 poor


life
 choice
 that
 certainly
 contributed


to
 him
 be
 getting
 killed.
 There's
 no


question
 about
 that.


>> Does
 what
 happened
 to
 Prey?
 Does
 that


video
 change
 in
 any
 way
 the
 way
 that
 you


think
 about
 the
 Trump
 administration
 and


its
 enforcement
 of
 immigration
 policies?


I
 would
 say
 that
 the
 way
 that
 these


policies
 are
 being
 enforced
 or
 were
 I


think
 Tom
 Holman
 actually
 introduces
 a


level
 of
 calm
 and
 consideration
 that


wasn't
 there
 before
 but
 the
 way
 that


they
 were
 being
 enforced
 was
 all
 wrong.


Conservatives
 are
 supposed
 to
 be
 in
 my


opinion
 suspect
 of
 government
 force
 and


the
 government's
 sole
 role
 is
 to
 protect


the
 individual
 from
 undue
 force
 and


fraud.
 I
 was
 definitely
 seeing
 an


element
 of
 undue
 force
 being
 perpetrated


by
 the
 federal
 government,
 which
 I
 am


100%
 against.
 When
 they
 begin
 to
 use


undue
 force
 on
 the
 citizens
 of
 this


country,
 it
 changes
 the
 dynamic
 of
 that


relationship
 and
 it's
 a
 very
 very
 very


big
 deal.


>> And
 what
 were
 your
 views
 on
 mass


deportations
 before
 like
 the
 goal?
 And


you
 know,
 have
 they
 changed
 in
 the
 past


year
 and
 also
 in
 the
 past
 week?


>> So
 my
 opinion
 of
 of
 mass
 deportations


and
 the
 idea
 that
 we
 need
 to
 deport


people
 who
 are
 in
 this
 country
 illegally


has
 not
 changed.
 Not
 because
 of
 this


event,
 not
 because
 of
 what's
 happening


in
 Minnesota.
 Just
 because
 the
 way
 that


something
 is
 being
 implemented,
 in
 my


opinion,
 is
 egregious.
 It's
 just


terribly
 ineffective
 and
 incompetent.


does
 not
 change
 the
 fact
 that
 I
 think


that
 the
 thing
 itself


is
 still
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 do.


>> So,
 is
 it
 fair
 to
 say
 that
 President


Trump
 still
 has
 your
 support,
 but
 they


need
 to
 do
 better?


>> I
 would
 say
 that
 the
 Constitution
 has
 my


support.


I
 mean,
 there
 are
 still
 some
 things
 that


that
 the
 Trump
 administration
 is
 doing


that
 I
 fully
 support.
 And
 the
 only
 thing


that
 I
 can
 say
 in
 terms
 of
 continuing
 to


support
 this
 administration
 is
 if
 Camala


Harris
 had
 won
 the
 election,
 I
 don't


think
 anything
 that
 I
 wanted
 would
 have


been
 accomplished
 at
 this
 point
 and


probably
 even
 made
 several
 things
 worse.


So,
 there's
 that.
 I'm
 still
 at
 least


this
 way
 getting
 something.
 But
 we
 still


have
 a
 really,
 really,
 really
 big


problem
 with
 an
 administration
 that


doesn't
 seem
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 regard
 for


the
 First
 Amendment,
 the
 Second


Amendment,
 the
 Fourth
 Amendment,
 and


probably
 several
 others.
 Let's
 be


honest,
 it's
 it's
 problematic.


Recent
 polling
 shows
 that
 about
 30%
 of


Republicans
 think
 immigration


enforcement
 tactics
 have
 gone
 too
 far,


but
 the
 vast
 majority
 say
 it's
 either
 on


track
 or
 needs
 to
 go
 even
 further


>> looking
 at
 how
 the
 Trump
 administration


is
 currently
 pursuing
 mass
 deportations.


Is
 there
 anything
 you
 would
 do


differently?


>> As
 far
 as
 the
 Trump
 administration
 goes,


no,
 not
 really.


He's
 doing
 all
 the
 things
 that
 he


promised
 while
 he
 was
 running.
 He's


doing
 what
 I
 hired
 him
 to
 do.


>> I
 think
 it's
 exactly
 what
 I
 voted
 for.


>> So
 to
 sit
 back
 and
 complain
 that
 he's


doing
 those
 things
 now
 is
 kind
 of
 stupid


if
 you
 ask
 me.
 If
 you
 voted
 for
 him,
 you


need
 to
 be
 supporting
 him
 all
 the
 way.


My
 problem
 isn't
 with
 the
 deportations.


My
 problem
 is
 that
 these
 so-called


protesters
 are
 instigating
 like
 they


want
 stuff
 like
 this
 to
 happen.


>> It's
 one
 thing
 to
 stand
 on
 the
 street


and
 make
 your
 voice
 heard.
 It's
 another


thing
 to
 get
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 those
 guys


doing
 their
 job
 and
 stand
 in
 their
 way.


>> You
 show
 up
 with
 a
 weapon.
 I'm
 sorry.


They're
 going
 to
 use
 force.


>> I
 know
 this
 sounds
 very
 harsh,
 but
 you


play
 stupid
 games.
 You
 win
 stupid


prizes.


>> You
 know,
 you
 make
 stupid
 choices,
 you


get
 stupid
 consequences.


I
 still
 support
 the
 deportation
 policy.


>> Illegal
 immigration
 is
 wrong.
 No
 matter


how
 you
 look
 at
 it,
 people
 have
 to
 leave


the
 country.


>> You
 know,
 whenever
 they
 say
 we're
 going


to
 get
 rid
 of
 the
 illegals
 and
 we're


going
 to
 close
 the
 border,
 nobody
 ever


says
 exactly
 what
 that's
 going
 to
 look


like.
 Or
 let's
 say
 making
 barbecue
 for


instance.
 I
 don't know.
 Do
 you
 like


barbecued
 pork?


>> Oh
 yeah.


>> Okay.
 You
 may
 not
 like
 watching
 how
 it's


made.
 So
 that's
 my
 point


>> is
 that
 it
 could
 be
 ugly.


>> It
 could
 be
 ugly.


After
 the
 break,
 we
 hear
 from
 one
 of


those
 Trump
 voters
 who
 thinks
 that
 the


president's
 deportation
 effort
 should
 go


even
 further
 and
 why
 for
 this
 voter
 that


feeling
 runs
 so
 deeply.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Can
 you
 tell
 me
 a
 little
 bit
 about


yourself?
 Your
 name,
 where
 you
 live,


what
 you
 do?


>> My
 name
 is
 John.
 I'm
 53
 years
 old.
 I'm
 a


Mason.
 I
 live
 in
 Massachusetts.
 I've


been
 in
 in
 the
 construction
 industry
 my


whole
 life
 and
 I
 own
 a
 very
 small


company.
 Um,
 I
 have
 a
 wife,
 two
 kids,


and
 um,
 that's
 me
 in
 a
 nutshell.
 I
 first


connected
 with
 John
 Pyma
 about
 3
 weeks


ago.
 He
 lives
 in
 Bolton,
 a
 rural
 town
 in


central
 Massachusetts.
 Is
 there
 a


political
 party
 that
 you
 have


historically
 identified
 with?


>> Um,
 initially
 it
 would
 have
 been
 the


Democratic
 party
 when
 I
 was
 in
 high


school
 and
 probably
 a
 few
 years
 after.


And
 then
 I
 generally
 kind
 of
 turned


conservative


and
 I
 voted
 for
 Trump
 in
 2024.


>> Uh-huh.
 And
 did
 you
 vote
 for
 him
 in
 16?


You
 know,
 have
 you
 always
 felt
 like
 he


is
 a
 politician
 that
 you've
 believed
 in?


>> So
 in
 2016,
 2020,
 and
 2024,


I
 believe
 I
 was
 given
 the
 option,
 and


excuse
 my
 French,
 I
 was
 given
 the
 option


to
 eat
 [ __ ]
 or
 drink
 piss.
 And
 in
 all


three
 cases,
 I
 drank
 piss.


>> So
 there's
 your
 answer.
 And
 in
 all
 three


cases,
 I
 voted
 for
 Trump.
 So
 that's
 how


much
 passion
 I
 have
 for
 the
 man.


>> Mhm.
 What
 were
 the
 most
 important
 issues


to
 you
 when
 you
 cast
 your
 ballot
 in


2024?


>> Well,
 immigration
 was
 a
 major
 issue,
 but


that
 has
 been
 an
 issue
 my
 whole
 entire


life.


>> Can
 I
 ask
 why?


>> Uh
 because
 of
 what
 I
 do.
 To
 be
 kind
 of


simple,
 I
 move
 mass
 with
 my
 body.
 I'm
 a


laborer
 at
 the
 very
 root
 of
 what
 I
 do.
 I


move
 things.
 I
 pick
 things
 up.
 I
 put


things
 down.
 And
 that
 kind
 of
 work


has
 been
 compromised
 by
 illegal


immigration
 greatly.


I
 got
 into
 construction
 purely
 as
 an


accident.
 I
 was
 sort
 of
 a
 juvenile


delinquent
 a
 bit
 and
 my
 cousin
 Ted


worked
 for
 me
 in
 Nucket
 for
 a
 landscape


construction
 company
 and
 I
 went
 down


there
 and
 I
 worked
 as
 a
 laborer


and
 then
 as
 I
 did
 it
 I
 you
 know
 I
 became


a
 pretty
 good
 laborer.


Later
 I
 worked
 for
 other
 companies
 and
 I


was
 seeing
 people
 getting
 hired
 and


getting
 paid
 a
 lot
 less
 than
 me.


And
 when
 I
 inquired
 about
 it,
 my
 boss


would
 say,
 "Well,
 they're
 less


expensive.
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 pay
 workman's


comp
 on
 them.
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 pay


general
 liability
 insurance
 on
 them.
 If


they
 get
 hurt,
 they'll
 go
 to
 the


emergency
 room.
 No
 sweat
 off
 my
 back."


And
 I
 was
 getting
 paid
 less
 and
 less


because
 I
 was
 competing
 against
 people


who
 were
 hired
 because
 it
 cost
 less
 to


hire
 them
 or
 employ
 them.
 That
 bothered


me.
 And
 then
 when
 I
 became
 a
 Mason
 and
 I


started
 building,
 I
 found
 that
 I
 was


competing
 with
 companies
 that
 did
 that


practice.
 And
 I
 I
 couldn't
 hire
 an


illegal
 alien.
 I
 I
 just
 didn't
 seem


right.
 And
 it's
 illegal,
 by
 the
 way,
 but


people
 are
 getting
 away
 with
 it.
 And
 I'm


competing
 against
 them.


And
 you
 notice
 it
 by
 just
 simply
 seeing


the
 crews
 that
 are
 going
 out
 there.
 And


when
 you
 give
 a
 price
 to
 somebody
 to
 do


work,
 you're
 not
 even
 close
 to
 the


lowest
 or
 the
 mid
 price.
 You're
 always


the
 highest
 price.
 And
 I'm
 never
 going


to
 get
 a
 certain
 percentage
 of
 jobs.
 And


then
 I
 can't
 increase
 my
 rate
 because


it's
 an
 unfair
 marketplace.


I
 like
 the
 idea
 of
 working
 for
 myself


and
 I
 could
 do
 the
 work
 and
 I
 was
 good


at
 it,
 but
 it's
 getting
 to
 the
 point
 I'm


getting
 older
 and
 it's
 harder
 to
 do,


especially
 now
 I
 can't
 I
 can't
 hire
 a


laborer
 because
 I
 don't
 feel
 that
 I
 can


give
 them
 an
 um
 a
 living
 wage.
 So,
 it's


just
 me
 doing
 the
 work,
 which
 is
 it's


beating
 me
 up
 quite
 a
 bit,
 but
 um
 try
 to


stay
 in
 shape
 and
 I
 keep
 going.


>> Did
 you
 feel
 under
 Biden
 that
 that


problem
 was
 worse?
 The
 problem
 of


competition
 from
 immigrant
 labor?


>> No,
 it's
 been
 steadily
 getting
 worse.


What
 recently
 kind
 of
 narrowed
 down
 my


thought
 process
 on
 that
 was
 what
 Trump


did
 at
 the
 border
 his
 second
 term.
 by


immediately
 shutting
 it
 down
 the
 border


crossings.
 All
 the
 way
 back
 to
 when
 I


started
 working
 when
 I
 think
 it
 was
 Bush


Senior
 was
 president,
 uh
 we
 had
 illegal


immigration
 problems.
 It
 seems
 like


every
 president
 had
 an
 opportunity
 to


stop
 that
 flood
 of
 illegal
 immigrants


going
 over
 the
 border
 and
 none
 of
 them,


Democrat
 or
 Republican,
 did
 anything


about
 it.
 And
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 could


have
 been
 done
 so
 quickly
 as
 we
 have


seen


is
 a
 little
 alarming
 to
 me.
 It
 makes
 me


feel
 like
 I'm
 forgotten
 as
 an
 American


worker,
 as
 a
 workingclass
 person.


They
 talk
 about
 the
 working
 class
 in


this
 country.
 They
 talk
 about
 the


business
 owners
 in
 this
 country
 being


the
 backbone
 of
 the
 country.
 But


politicians
 don't
 believe
 that
 or
 they


don't
 act
 on
 that.
 Well,
 this
 brings
 me


to
 the
 next
 question
 that
 I
 wanted
 to


ask
 you,
 which
 is
 how
 do
 you
 feel
 about


what
 President
 Trump
 has
 done
 on


immigration
 so
 far
 this
 first
 year
 of


his
 second
 term?


>> I'd
 like
 to
 say
 he's
 doing
 enough.
 I


don't
 think
 he
 is,
 but
 this
 country


seems
 to
 not
 be
 able
 to
 handle
 it.
 I


don't
 think
 we
 have
 the
 stomach
 for
 it.


What
 needs
 to
 happen?
 ICE
 shouldn't
 be


put
 in
 a
 situation
 where
 they
 have
 to


fight
 citizens
 of
 the
 country
 to
 do
 a


job
 that
 should
 have
 never
 happened.
 We


shouldn't
 have had
 this
 issue
 with


illegal
 immigrants,
 but
 now
 we
 do.
 It's


very
 hard
 to
 stomach
 what
 we
 need
 to
 do


to
 take
 care
 of
 it.


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 needs
 to
 be
 done?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 we
 need
 to
 do
 what
 he's


doing.
 I
 think
 we
 do
 need
 to
 remove
 all


illegal
 immigrants,
 no matter
 how
 long


they've
 been
 here.
 In
 fact,


>> I'm
 not
 uncompassionate
 to
 the
 people


that
 are
 illegally
 here.
 They
 are


generally
 good
 people
 and
 I
 think


everyone
 can
 agree
 that
 they
 generally


aren't
 violent,
 but
 this
 is
 where
 the


compassion
 problem
 is
 in
 my
 opinion.
 So,


we
 have
 compassion
 for
 these
 people
 who


need
 work
 and
 they
 need
 to
 better
 their


lives.
 But
 my
 compassion
 has
 to
 lie
 with


the
 American
 worker
 first.
 And
 we
 should


really
 think
 about
 our
 immigration


policy
 in
 general
 if
 the
 people
 here


can't
 find
 the
 American
 dream.


>> Mhm.


>> I'm
 don't
 know
 if
 he's
 doing
 enough.
 And


I
 fear
 that
 if
 he
 did
 more
 accidents


like
 we've
 seen
 has
 happened
 will


happen,
 which
 is
 horrible.
 It's


horrible.
 But
 we
 have
 to
 step
 back
 and


say,
 why
 did
 that
 happen?
 Why
 is
 there


an
 ICE
 agent
 in
 Minnesota?
 There


shouldn't
 be
 an
 ICE
 agent
 in
 Minnesota.


We
 just
 shut
 the
 border
 down.
 The
 ICE


agent
 is
 in
 Minnesota
 because
 of
 40


years
 of
 illegal
 immigration.


>> Is
 there
 a
 point
 when
 you
 think
 it
 will


be
 enough?
 Like
 what's
 the
 end
 goal
 that


you
 think
 is
 right?


>> I
 mean,
 ideally
 you
 want
 zero
 illegal


immigrants
 in
 your
 country.


Is
 it
 achievable?
 I
 have
 don't
 believe


it
 is
 possible.
 I
 don't
 know
 though.
 And


unfortunately,
 we're
 at
 the
 point
 where


when
 we
 fix
 this,
 it's
 going
 to
 cost


money.
 I
 mean,
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to


pay
 more
 to
 get
 your
 lawn
 cut,
 your
 roof


done.
 And
 you
 should
 pay
 more


because
 that's
 how
 much
 the
 job
 takes.


And
 that's
 how
 much
 these
 people
 who
 do


this
 job
 should
 make.
 They
 should
 make
 a


living
 to
 earn
 that
 American
 dream.


Just
 over
 a
 week
 after
 John
 and
 I
 spoke,


federal
 agents
 killed
 Alex
 Prey,
 the


second
 US
 citizen
 in
 Minnesota
 in
 less


than
 a
 month.
 I
 called
 John
 back
 to
 see


if
 this
 had
 shifted
 his
 views.


I
 saw
 some
 of
 the
 video,
 but
 I
 didn't


analyze
 it.
 I
 just
 know
 that
 probably


there
 were
 a
 couple
 faults
 there.
 I


don't
 believe
 he
 should
 have
 been
 shot.


I
 believe
 probably
 the
 officer
 that
 shot


him


may
 not
 have
 known
 that
 the
 gun
 was


taken
 away
 from
 him
 and
 may
 have
 heard


another
 officer
 yell
 gun.


So,
 there's
 faults
 with
 the
 video
 not


kind
 of
 showing
 that,
 but
 I
 don't
 know


if
 you
 can
 get
 the
 whole
 story
 out
 of


that
 video.
 I
 certainly
 didn't.
 I
 know


that
 a
 person
 died
 and
 that's
 wrong
 and


I
 know
 officers
 felt
 threatened
 and


that's
 wrong.


>> However,
 what
 bothered
 me
 most
 about
 the


whole
 thing
 is
 that
 in
 2025
 there
 were


people
 that
 died
 by
 the
 hands
 of
 illegal


immigrants.
 I
 just
 looked
 it
 up
 quickly


and
 some
 of
 them
 were
 were
 pretty
 bad


and
 I
 put
 their
 names
 on
 the
 Google
 and


to
 see
 if
 I
 could
 find
 news
 stories


about
 them
 and
 I
 particularly
 went
 to


the
 New
 York
 Times


and
 there's
 no
 news
 on
 the
 first
 people


I
 put
 in.
 Not
 one
 news
 article
 yet
 on


this
 man
 that
 got
 shot
 by
 the
 border


patrol
 there's
 18.
 I
 stopped
 counting
 at


18.
 But
 there
 was
 a
 boy
 that
 got
 killed


by
 an
 illegal
 immigrant
 when
 he
 was


helping
 his
 mother
 or
 stopping
 her
 from


getting
 raped.
 Just
 2025,


no
 report
 from
 the
 New
 York
 Times.


And
 it's
 just
 there's
 a
 moral
 kind
 of


compass
 there
 that
 I
 think
 has
 been


lost.
 So
 that
 that
 that
 bothers
 me


like
 a
 lot.
 Beyond
 the
 drum
 beat
 of
 news


coverage
 around
 Alex
 Py's
 death,
 John


told
 me
 he
 was
 also
 frustrated
 that


local
 law
 enforcement
 wasn't
 helping


federal
 immigration
 officials
 carry
 out


the
 deportations.


That
 ideally
 they'd
 be
 working
 together


as
 a
 team.


But
 despite
 these
 challenges,
 despite


the
 death
 of
 two
 American
 citizens,


despite
 the
 protests,
 John
 still
 wanted


the
 Trump
 administration
 to
 stay
 the


course
 in
 Minnesota.


>> Just
 because
 the
 job
 isn't
 working


doesn't
 mean
 you
 stop
 doing
 the
 job.
 I


believe
 in
 people's
 civil
 rights
 and


their
 right
 to
 protest.


When
 the
 protests
 stop
 a
 federal
 agent


from
 doing
 his
 job,
 that's
 when
 it
 stops


being
 protest.
 You
 know,
 the
 free
 speech


amendment
 is
 you
 can
 say
 anything
 you


want,
 but
 you
 can't
 yell
 fire
 in
 a


packed
 movie
 theater.
 You
 can't
 take
 it


to
 that
 extreme.
 You
 can
 be
 on
 the


sidelines


and
 protest.


And
 the
 state
 and
 local
 government


should
 be
 there
 making
 sure
 the
 protest


is
 not
 getting
 involved
 with
 the
 federal


officers.
 And
 they
 can
 protest
 and
 they


have
 every
 right
 to
 and
 they
 should.
 If


they
 don't
 feel
 this
 is
 right,
 they


should
 protest
 absolutely.


But
 they
 should
 not
 get
 involved
 in
 the


operations
 of
 federal
 agents
 going
 after


illegal
 immigrants.
 That
 was
 a
 course
 of


action
 that
 was
 mandated
 by
 the
 people


of
 this
 country.


Mhm.


Is
 there
 a
 point
 at
 which
 the
 cost


becomes
 too
 much?
 The
 cost
 of
 pursuing


this
 goal
 of


deporting
 people
 in
 the
 country


illegally.


One
 life
 should
 be
 too
 much.


But
 the
 people
 who
 are
 getting
 hurt
 here


are
 people
 who
 are
 getting
 themselves


involved
 in
 a
 action
 that
 is
 inherently


risky,


violent.
 It
 involves
 weapons.
 It


involves
 human
 beings
 moving
 other
 human


beings
 who
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 moved.
 If


someone
 puts
 themselves
 in
 a
 situation


like
 that,
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 issues.


Just
 stay
 home.
 Let
 the
 government
 do


the
 job
 that
 your
 previous
 government


got
 them
 into.
 It's
 not
 like
 Trump


brought
 these
 illegal
 immigrants
 into


these
 areas
 just
 so
 he
 could
 kill


American
 citizens.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 what


it
 sounds
 like
 if
 you
 read
 the


newspapers.
 It
 sounds
 like
 Trump
 started


all
 this
 and
 his
 border
 patrol
 started


this.
 Well,
 if
 everyone
 just
 stayed
 home


and
 let
 them
 do
 their
 jobs,
 there
 would


be
 no
 deaths.


I
 wonder
 just
 what
 does
 the
 ideal


situation
 look
 like
 when
 you
 think
 about


the
 immigration
 system
 you'd
 like
 to


live
 under
 in
 10
 years
 or
 20
 years?


>> I
 guess
 what
 it
 would
 matter
 on
 the


state
 of
 this
 country
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 it


treats
 its
 lowest
 income
 earners.


So
 if
 we
 have
 the
 ability
 for
 a


citizens,
 you
 know,
 after
 high
 school
 to


get
 a
 job,
 to
 make
 a
 good
 income,
 buy
 a


house,
 possibly
 to
 raise
 a
 family,


then
 we
 should
 have
 an
 immigration


policy
 that's
 very
 liberal


with
 vetting
 of
 all
 people
 from
 all


places
 and
 have
 it
 equal
 to
 people
 of


all
 places.
 They
 like
 it
 to
 be
 an
 actual


melting
 pot
 of
 people
 all
 around
 the


world.
 So
 that's
 where
 I
 see
 it
 in
 the


future.


Well,
 thank
 you
 for
 talking
 to
 me
 and


talking
 to
 me
 a
 couple
 times.


>> Thank
 you.
 And
 uh
 hope
 you're
 doing
 well


as
 well.
 Bye-bye.


>> Bye-bye.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need
 today.
 The


latest
 disclosure
 of
 documents
 related


to
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 has
 led
 to
 the


resignation
 of
 a
 top
 aid
 to
 Britain's


prime
 minister.
 On
 Sunday,
 Morgan


Mweeny,
 the
 chief
 of
 staff
 to
 Prime


Minister
 Kier
 Starmer,
 stepped
 down
 over


his
 role
 in
 the
 appointment
 of
 an


Epstein
 friend
 as
 Britain's
 ambassador


to
 the
 United
 States.
 New
 emails
 showed


that
 the
 ambassador,
 Peter
 Mandlesson,


had
 a
 close
 relationship
 with
 Epstein


and
 even
 shared
 sensitive
 government


information
 with
 him.


Mweeny
 said
 that
 he
 now
 regrets


recommending
 Mandlesson
 for
 the


ambassadorship.


The
 latest
 Epstein
 disclosures
 will
 be


the
 subject
 of
 tomorrow's
 show.


And
 days
 after
 the
 Washington
 Post
 laid


off
 hundreds
 of
 journalists,
 its
 CEO
 and


publisher
 Will
 Lewis
 has
 resigned.


Lewis,
 who
 was
 appointed
 by
 post
 owner


Jeff
 Bezos,
 failed
 to
 turn
 around
 the


post's
 finances
 and
 had
 a
 strained


relationship
 with
 its
 newsroom.
 That


relationship
 was
 further
 inflamed
 by


Lewis's
 decision
 not
 to
 speak
 to
 the


newsroom
 during
 the
 layoffs.
 Instead,


around
 the
 same
 time,
 he
 was
 spotted


attending
 an
 event
 related
 to
 the
 Super


Bowl
 in
 San
 Francisco.


Today's
