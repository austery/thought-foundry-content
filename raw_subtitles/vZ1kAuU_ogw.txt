[music]


There
 is
 a
 devil's
 bargain
 between


teacher
 or
 professor
 and
 student,
 which


is
 the
 less
 work
 they
 both
 do,
 the


happier
 they
 both
 are.
 And
 AI
 can


turbocharge
 that
 like
 nothing
 else.


The
 majority
 of
 the
 incoming
 class
 in


the
 Ivy
 League
 for
 the
 last
 30
 years


were
 millionaires
 coming
 in.
 That
 is
 who


these
 universities
 select.


Fore
 [music]


23
 and
 me


are


Turns
 out
 that
 lecture
 is
 the
 least


effective
 way
 to
 educate.
 People


remember
 1%
 of
 what
 they
 heard
 in
 a


lecture.
 The
 second
 least
 effective
 way


is
 reading
 a
 book.
 That's
 I
 think
 they


retain
 about
 5%.
 So
 what
 is
 the
 most


effective
 way


accelerator
 for
 learning


is
 about
 how


And
 uh
 universities
 have
 tended
 to
 focus


on
 one
 specific
 age
 group
 which
 are


those
 generally
 18
 to
 25
 plus
 year
 old


young
 adults
 when
 in
 fact
 you
 [music]


have
 this
 entire
 demographic
 that's


growing.
 That's
 also
 we're
 looking
 at


continuous
 and
 lifelong
 learning.


>> [music]


>> All
 right,
 good
 afternoon.
 Thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 being
 here
 with
 us.
 My
 name
 is


Joy
 Joy
 Chen.
 I
 am
 very
 honored
 to
 be


the
 moderator
 for
 today's
 panel
 about
 AI


and
 education.
 And
 also
 I'm
 very


delighted
 to
 share
 the
 stage
 with
 three


of
 my
 dear
 friends,
 Ben,
 Isabelle,
 and


Esther.
 Um
 so
 let's
 just
 dive
 into
 the


conversation.
 Uh
 over
 the
 past
 several


years
 uh
 we
 have
 witnessed
 how
 AI
 has


transformed
 how
 we
 live,
 how
 we
 work
 and


of
 course
 how
 we
 learn
 and
 um
 I'd
 like


to
 ask
 uh
 three
 uh
 panelists
 when
 you


think
 about
 AI
 and
 education
 especially


when
 we
 look
 forward
 uh
 look
 towards
 uh


2030
 and
 beyond
 what
 excites
 you
 the


most
 and
 what
 concerns
 you
 the
 most?


Maybe
 I
 can
 start
 with
 uh
 Esther.


>> So,
 what
 excites
 me
 the
 most
 is
 that
 AI


can
 be
 a
 tutor
 for
 every
 single
 student.


They
 can
 ask
 questions.
 They
 can
 ask
 it


over
 and
 over
 again.
 They
 don't
 have
 to


worry
 about
 being
 stupid
 or
 anything.


And
 they
 can
 get
 answers
 right
 away.
 And


that
 was
 not
 the
 case
 before.
 And
 I


think
 all
 teachers
 should
 use
 AI
 as


tutors
 in
 the
 classroom.
 Um,


unfortunately,
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 we
 all


have
 exciting
 ideas
 over
 here.
 I
 think


that
 what
 we
 need
 to
 do
 is
 try
 to
 get


those
 ideas
 across
 to
 the
 teachers


because,
 um,
 right
 now,
 I
 don't
 know
 how


many
 of
 you
 have
 kids
 in
 the
 school


system,
 but
 they're
 still
 doing
 the
 same


old
 thing,
 memorizing
 answers
 to
 last


centuries
 problems.


>> And
 what
 concerns
 you
 the
 most
 with
 AI?


Well,
 with
 AI,
 what
 concerns
 me,
 it's


growing
 really,
 really
 quickly
 and
 um


hopefully
 ethically.


I
 think
 the
 ethics
 and
 the
 deep
 fakes


and
 all
 the
 fake
 news
 and
 fake


information
 out
 there,
 that
 concerns
 me


the
 most.
 So,
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 to


teach
 kids
 how
 to
 think
 critically.
 And


um
 they
 learn
 to
 do
 that
 by
 actually


making
 mistakes
 and
 doing
 it
 again,
 not


by
 you
 telling
 them
 what
 to
 do.


>> Totally
 agree.
 And
 what
 about
 you,


Isabelle?


>> Yeah,
 what
 excites
 me
 the
 most
 is
 um
 um


education
 has
 not
 worked
 for
 many
 many


children
 uh
 and
 adult
 learners.
 Um
 and


so
 here
 we
 have
 a
 technology
 that
 sally


unlocks
 profound
 questions,
 profound


possibilities.


Um
 we
 call
 AI
 um
 the
 WD40


for
 education.
 It's
 unlocking
 new


questions
 uh
 such
 as
 you
 know
 what
 does


it
 mean
 to
 be
 future
 ready
 uh
 in
 this


age
 of
 AI?
 What
 is
 the
 purpose
 of


education?
 Things
 that
 we
 have
 been


wanting
 to
 ask
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 So
 I'm


very
 very
 excited
 about
 all
 those
 new


possibilities.


And
 then
 what
 concerns
 me
 the
 most
 is
 um


right
 now
 AI
 is
 used
 for
 a
 lot
 of


efficiency
 applications
 in
 education.
 Uh


which
 is
 good.
 Um
 but
 if
 we
 stop
 if
 we


stop
 there,
 we
 risk
 replicating
 the
 past


as
 opposed
 to
 rem
 reimagining
 the


future,
 which
 I
 think
 is
 uh
 what
 I'm


most
 excited
 about
 with
 this
 technology


is
 new
 possibilities.


I'll
 give
 you
 a
 um
 my
 concern
 first
 and


then
 maybe
 what
 I'm
 excited
 about.
 The


concern
 is
 based
 on
 the
 state
 of
 our


education
 system.
 When
 when
 I
 was


looking
 for
 a
 school
 for
 my
 uh
 eldest


daughter
 about
 12
 years
 ago,
 I
 tried
 a


school
 that
 was
 an
 arts
 a
 performing


arts
 school
 for
 academically
 gifted


children.
 And
 it
 was
 that's
 kind
 of
 an


interesting
 combination.
 And
 I
 asked
 the


the
 son
 of
 the
 founder
 who
 was
 giving


the
 tour
 as
 a
 principal.
 I
 said,
 "How


did
 your
 mother
 come
 up
 with
 this
 idea


of
 of
 a
 art
 school
 for
 academically


gifted
 children?"
 He
 says
 she
 didn't.


She
 wanted
 to
 start
 an
 art
 school.
 She


had
 no
 care
 in
 the
 world
 about
 the


academics
 whatsoever.
 So
 in
 1981,
 she


used
 the
 California
 state
 standard


curriculum
 that
 everybody
 was
 using
 and


we
 never
 changed
 it.
 And
 now,
 which
 was


12
 years
 ago,
 we're
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half


ahead
 of
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 state.


And
 why
 do
 I
 bring
 this
 up?
 I
 bring
 it


up
 because
 there
 is
 a
 devil's
 bargain


between
 teacher
 or
 professor
 and


student,
 which
 is
 the
 less
 work
 they


both
 do,
 the
 happier
 they
 both
 are.
 And


AI
 can
 turbocharge
 that
 like
 nothing


else.


AI
 can
 make
 the
 teacher's
 job
 much,
 much


easier.
 It
 can
 make
 the
 students
 job


much
 much
 easier
 and
 there's
 no
 learning


that
 happens
 on
 either
 side
 and
 that's


the
 biggest
 risk
 because
 the
 incentive


system
 of
 everyone
 involved
 in
 the


certification
 or
 otherwise
 what's
 known


as
 the
 education
 sector
 is
 to
 do
 as


little
 work
 as
 humanly
 possible.
 The


opportunity
 and
 the
 opportunity
 with


every
 new
 technology
 to
 Isabelle's
 point


is
 not
 how
 to
 take
 that
 old
 technology


and
 jam
 it
 into
 the
 current
 system.
 It


is
 to
 say,
 "Wow,
 this
 old
 system
 doesn't


work
 whatsoever.


What
 kind
 of
 system,
 what
 kind
 of


educational
 path
 is
 now
 enabled
 that


couldn't
 be
 done
 before?"
 And
 and
 that


is
 the
 big
 opportunity
 that
 AI
 unlocks


for
 those
 bold
 enough
 to
 think
 in
 that


way.


Well,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 sharing
 your


excitements
 and
 concerns.
 Um,
 with
 all


the
 things
 AI
 has
 brought
 to
 our
 life


and
 will
 continue
 to
 bring
 to
 our
 life,


I
 do
 think
 our
 education
 education


system
 will
 have
 to
 go
 through
 lots
 of


change,
 lots
 of
 transformations
 to
 meet


the
 new
 learning
 uh
 uh
 needs
 and
 also


the
 shifting
 workforce
 expectations.
 Um


so
 if
 especially
 universities
 actually


because
 they
 are
 preparing
 our
 uh


students
 for
 their
 future
 career.
 Um
 so


if
 today
 you
 guys
 were
 given
 an


opportunity
 to
 redesign
 universities
 um


what
 would
 your
 university
 uh
 be
 like
 uh


maybe
 I
 I'd
 like
 to
 start
 from
 Ben


because
 you
 have
 already
 start
 this


vision
 and
 mission
 ever
 since
 you


founded
 uh
 Minurva
 University
 which
 by


the
 way
 is
 a
 huge
 success.
 Uh


congratulations.


>> Thank
 you.
 Um
 well,
 Manuva
 was
 certainly


built
 uh
 because
 of
 my
 mistaken


assumption
 or
 one
 of the
 reasons
 it
 was


built
 my
 mistaken
 assumption
 that


basically
 AI
 would
 be
 widely
 available


circa
 2012.
 So
 I
 I
 was
 off
 by
 a
 few


years
 in
 that.
 But
 I
 built
 a
 university


that
 asked
 the
 question
 of
 what
 does
 it


mean
 to
 be
 human
 when
 access
 to


knowledge
 and
 not
 just
 knowledge
 but
 to


solutions
 is
 readily
 available.
 And
 when


you
 think
 about
 that
 paradigm,


what's
 left
 for
 human
 beings
 is
 to


judge,
 is
 to
 discern,
 to
 make
 decisions.


Because
 we
 may
 outsource
 a
 lot
 of
 work


to
 the
 machine,
 but
 I
 don't
 think


anybody
 here
 would
 be
 excited
 if
 a


machine
 determined
 your
 tax
 rate,


>> right?
 You
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 decide.


You
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 participate,
 to


govern,
 to
 vote.


And
 the
 discernment
 not
 in
 the
 black
 and


white
 because
 it's
 obvious
 when


something
 is
 true
 or
 false
 or
 at least


it
 used
 to
 be
 but
 in
 the
 black
 and
 gray


when
 there's
 certainly
 wrong
 answers


though
 again
 we
 are
 getting
 worse
 and


worse
 in
 identifying
 what
 wrong
 answers


are
 and
 there
 are
 many
 potentially


correct
 answers.
 An
 AI
 is
 going
 to


produce
 in
 a
 blink
 of
 an
 eye
 a
 whole


number
 of
 completely
 plausible


scenarios.
 And
 so
 like
 what
 the
 video


said,
 which
 I
 disagree
 with,
 it's
 not


about
 knowing
 how
 to
 ask
 a
 question.


It's
 knowing
 how
 to
 evaluate
 the
 answer


that
 comes
 out
 of
 that
 asked
 question.


The
 ability
 to
 to
 discern
 actually
 means


that
 students
 would
 need
 to
 learn


significantly
 more
 than
 they
 did
 in
 the


past,
 not
 less.
 And
 that
 really
 is
 the


big
 challenge.
 How
 do
 we
 turbocharge


what
 it
 is
 that
 students
 are
 able
 to
 do


coming
 out
 of
 education?
 and
 the


disparity


in
 that
 world
 between
 those
 who
 are


well-educated,
 not
 well
 certified,
 well


educated,
 actually
 know
 how
 to
 discern


versus
 those
 that
 don't
 is
 going
 to
 be


colossal.


>> Thank
 you.
 Isabelle,
 you
 have
 worked
 for


Stanford
 for
 several
 years.
 What
 is
 your


uh
 future
 university
 look
 like?
 Yeah,
 I


would
 love
 to
 see
 universities
 take


advantage
 universities
 and
 by
 the
 way


innovators
 in
 the
 room
 take
 advantage
 of


um
 one
 major
 demographic
 and
 then
 work


force
 change
 that's
 happening
 under


that's
 already
 underway
 which
 is
 that
 we


are
 living
 longer
 lives


uh
 all
 around
 this
 planet
 and
 uh


universities
 have
 tended
 to
 focus
 on
 one


specific
 age
 group
 which
 are
 those


generally
 18
 to
 25
 plus
 year
 old
 um


young
 adults
 when
 in
 fact
 you
 have
 this


um
 entire
 demographic
 that's
 growing
 uh


that's
 also
 we
 look
 looking
 at


continuous
 continuous
 and
 lifelong


learning.
 So
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 huge


opportunity
 that
 uh
 universities
 and
 new


models
 of
 adult
 learning
 should
 take


advantage
 of.
 Um
 it's
 also
 the
 nice


thing
 about
 it
 is
 that
 also
 consistent


with
 what
 we
 are
 seeing
 in
 the
 future
 of


work
 or
 this
 future
 that's
 already
 here


where
 um
 the
 number
 of
 occupations
 that


any
 one
 of
 us
 will
 hold
 in
 the
 future


will
 continue
 increasing
 and
 rising.
 So


not
 only
 discernment
 um
 which
 will
 be


key
 and
 critical
 thinking
 and
 all
 these


uh
 uh
 critical
 skills
 but
 also


adaptability


um
 and
 frankly
 upskilling
 and
 reskilling


that
 will
 need
 to
 happen
 a
 lot
 more
 in


our
 future.
 So
 I
 would
 love
 to
 see
 um


and
 there
 are
 already
 many
 models
 that


are
 focused
 on
 this
 but
 universities
 and


new
 models
 uh
 focus
 on
 these
 um
 older


adults
 that
 will
 need
 uh
 more
 more
 and


more
 uh
 and
 want
 to
 continue
 learning.


>> That's
 a
 very
 good
 point.
 What
 about


you?


So
 I'm
 very
 practical
 because
 I'm
 a


teacher
 and
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 uh
 in
 the


university
 the
 majority
 of
 teachers


professors
 lecture
 and
 it's
 very
 hard
 to


change
 old
 patterns
 of
 behavior


and
 so
 how
 are
 you
 going
 to
 change
 that


that's
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 am
 concerned


about
 turns
 out
 that
 lecture
 is
 the


least
 effective
 way
 to
 educate
 people


remember
 1%
 %
 of
 what
 they
 heard
 in
 a


lecture.
 The
 second
 least
 effective
 way


is
 reading
 a
 book.
 That's
 I
 think
 they


retain
 about
 5%.
 So
 what
 is
 the
 most


effective
 way?
 Most
 effective
 is


peerto-peer


projectbased
 learning.
 When
 you
 do


something
 that
 you
 want
 to
 do
 together


with
 your
 peers,
 a
 project
 you
 come
 up


with
 yourself,


then
 you
 remember.
 So
 what
 I
 think
 AI


can
 do
 is
 help
 teams
 of
 kids
 working
 on


projects
 and
 help
 them
 understand
 what


the
 mistakes
 are,
 what
 the
 things
 are


that
 they
 should
 not
 do
 or
 whatever.
 And


I
 think
 all
 AI,
 all
 interaction
 should


be
 done
 in
 groups.
 Group
 of
 two
 or
 three


because
 we're
 then
 training
 kids
 to
 work


in
 the
 real
 world.
 All
 of
 you
 work
 in


teams.
 I'm
 sure
 that
 none
 of
 you
 are


working
 totally
 by
 yourself.
 So
 why
 not


train
 the
 kids
 for
 the
 world
 that


exists,
 the
 world
 after
 they
 go
 to


school.
 train
 them
 to
 work
 in
 groups
 on


projects
 that
 they
 personally
 care


about.
 Also,
 I'm
 very
 realistic
 that


changing
 the
 school,
 it's
 kind
 of
 like


changing
 the
 church.
 Okay?
 Never
 going


to
 happen.


>> So,
 may
 I
 shouldn't
 say
 never,
 but
 it's


a
 little
 hard.
 So,
 I
 think
 we
 should


change
 just
 a
 small
 percentage,
 maybe


20%
 of
 the
 school
 time
 at
 once
 and
 then


maybe
 move
 to
 30%.


Let's
 see
 what
 we
 can
 do
 to
 actually


change
 the
 school
 so
 that
 more
 kids
 can


do
 at
 learning
 that
 matters.


>> Well,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.
 Actually,
 I


can't
 agree
 more.
 Um
 when
 you
 say
 like


it's
 very
 difficult
 to
 change
 the
 school


system
 and
 especially
 nowadays
 actually


we
 are
 still
 having
 this
 is
 this
 very


much
 linear
 learning
 journeys
 uh
 from


K12
 to
 higher
 education.
 uh
 people


collect
 high
 school
 diploma
 um
 um
 um
 a


bachelor
 degree
 and
 then
 master
 degree


and
 doctor
 degree.
 So
 uh
 in
 your
 uh
 uh


perspective,
 what
 do
 you
 think
 about
 how


the
 future
 will
 hold
 the
 values
 for


those
 degrees?
 Uh
 do
 you
 think
 they
 will


still
 have
 those
 uh
 that
 much
 value
 or


you
 think
 something
 new
 will
 come
 up?


Some
 new
 learning
 pathways
 will
 come
 up


and
 who
 want
 to
 take
 the
 question?


All
 of
 you
 guys
 actually


>> you
 can
 you
 can
 pick
 it
 up.
 Yeah,
 if
 you


want.


>> Well,
 I
 sorry
 to
 say
 I
 think
 that
 the


value
 of
 these
 degrees
 is
 going
 to
 be


diminished
 as
 long
 as
 those
 degrees
 are


not
 tied
 to
 the
 real
 world
 and
 are
 not


tied
 to
 things
 that
 you
 can
 actually
 do


to
 make
 the
 real
 world
 better.
 So
 I


think
 we
 need
 to
 change
 the
 way
 we


educate
 and
 I
 think
 every
 single
 class


in
 all
 universities
 should
 have
 a


project-based
 element
 that
 kids
 can
 work


together.
 So
 one
 of
 my
 grandchildren


goes
 to
 UC
 Berkeley.
 I
 can
 just
 tell
 you


that
 the
 classes
 there
 are
 about
 500


>> too
 big.


>> 500.
 They're
 sitting
 there
 listening
 to


a
 lecture.
 Actually,
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 both


most
 of
 those
 kids
 are
 thinking
 about


what
 they're
 going
 to
 do
 after
 they
 get


out
 of
 the
 lecture.


[laughter]


So,
 we
 need
 to
 do
 something
 else.
 Give


them
 an
 opportunity
 to
 work
 on
 whatever


subject
 it
 is
 that
 they're
 studying
 in


teams.
 And
 that's
 what
 I
 think
 is


important.


I
 I
 think
 that
 the
 four-year
 degree
 will


continue
 holding
 a
 lot
 of
 value
 for
 some


uh
 people
 um
 and
 then
 you
 we
 will
 see


continued
 rise
 of
 alternative


credentials
 um
 that
 are
 much
 more


focused
 on
 skills.
 I
 mean
 the
 future
 is


um
 um
 showing
 us
 already
 that
 they
 will


be
 uh
 more
 and
 more
 smaller
 credentials


or
 carrier
 technical
 skills
 that
 are


rising
 uh
 already
 today
 with
 AI.
 So
 I


think
 this
 will
 probably
 be
 a
 mix
 of
 the


two
 in
 our
 future.
 Um
 and
 I'm
 I'm


hopeful
 as
 um
 you
 know
 I'm
 not
 as


negative
 because
 I'm
 teaching
 at


Stanford
 the
 class
 that's
 project
 based.


Uh
 so
 maybe
 I'm
 seeing
 already
 some


[laughter]
 some
 elements
 of
 Estelle's


vision
 happening
 um
 in
 big
 universities.


>> So
 does
 anybody
 here
 know
 if
 you
 look


back
 uh
 30
 years
 on
 the
 incoming
 class


of
 an
 Ivy
 League
 uh
 class
 Ivy
 plus
 class


Stanford
 etc.
 What
 is
 the
 only


characteristic
 that
 was
 shared
 by
 the


majority
 of
 the
 incoming
 class?
 Maybe
 we


Oh,


>> gradepoint
 average


>> over
 the
 last
 30
 years.


>> No,
 not
 grade
 point
 average.
 Not
 for
 the


Well,
 for
 the
 majority,
 I
 guess
 they
 had


some
 high
 class
 rank


>> test
 scores.


>> Some
 high
 test
 scores.


>> Well,
 that's
 what
 they
 value.
 I'm


>> talking
 about
 demographically.


>> White.


>> Nope.


No,
 not
 white.
 Nope,
 not
 the
 majority.


Millionaires,


the
 majority
 of
 the
 incoming
 class
 in


the
 Ivy
 League
 for
 the
 last
 30
 years


were
 millionaires
 coming
 in.


That
 is
 who
 these
 universities
 select.


And
 in
 the
 world
 before
 AI,


>> that's
 crazy.
 to
 hire
 the
 idiot
 children


of
 very
 rich
 people
 was
 fine
 because


they
 were
 maybe
 20%
 less
 productive
 than


deserving
 students
 who
 weren't
 born
 into


wealth.


>> But
 that's
 not
 true
 for
 UC
 Berkeley.
 The


UC


>> UC
 is
 not
 is
 not
 Ivy
 League.
 So
 not
 Ivy


Falls.


>> That's
 different.
 [laughter]


>> Well,
 UC
 is
 better.


>> Yeah.
 So
 that's
 different.
 Different


organization.
 And
 so
 you
 have
 a
 a
 a
 very


low
 tax
 in
 the
 past
 on
 hiring


well-connected
 kind
 of
 dumb
 people.


>> In
 the
 world
 of
 AI,


when
 your
 employee
 base
 is
 not
 producing


10x
 on
 a
 per
 person
 basis
 of
 what
 the


current
 employee
 does,
 your
 company
 is


out
 of
 business.
 Now
 this
 may
 not
 be


next
 year,
 the
 year
 after,
 but
 certainly


within
 a
 decade.


And
 so
 the
 signaling
 value
 of
 a
 degree


which
 adds
 impirically
 no
 benefit
 to
 its


graduates,
 zero,


is
 going
 to
 quickly
 match
 its
 real


output.
 The
 signaling
 value
 of
 these


degrees
 is
 going
 to
 become
 a
 negative
 so


long
 as
 those
 institutions
 do
 not


educate.
 And
 in
 a
 world
 where
 you
 do
 not


have
 to
 go
 to
 class
 because
 the
 lectures


are
 useless,
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 do


anything
 in
 the
 exam
 because
 a
 36
 will


get
 you
 an
 36
 out
 of
 100
 correct
 will


get
 you
 an
 A
 because
 of
 a
 curve.


And
 where
 you
 cannot
 flunk
 anything,
 the


value
 of
 that
 degree
 is
 going
 to
 be


reflected
 in
 society.
 And
 in
 fact,
 that


is
 what
 we
 are
 seeing
 today.
 the
 broad


attack
 on
 American
 higher
 education


whether
 you
 agree
 with
 those
 tactics
 or


not
 I
 happen
 to
 not
 agree
 with
 them
 but


there
 is
 a
 reason
 there
 is
 not
 a
 public


outro
 uh
 outro
 about
 what's
 happening


today
 to
 universities
 it's
 because
 we


have
 lost
 faith
 in
 those
 institutions


and
 that
 will
 be
 reflected
 in
 employment


>> very
 interesting
 sharing
 thank
 you
 so


much
 and
 putting
 degrees
 aside,
 uh,
 in


my
 personal
 opinion,
 I
 think
 the
 most


important
 thing
 will
 always
 be
 skills


and
 the
 competencies.
 Um,
 and
 in
 the
 AI


world,
 I
 like
 to
 ask
 you
 three,
 what
 do


you
 think
 will
 be
 the
 most
 important


skills
 and
 the
 competencies
 we
 need
 to


have
 to
 help
 us
 stay
 relevant
 and
 also


competitive
 in
 the
 AI
 world?
 Um,


>> Ben,
 you
 have
 the
 microphone.
 You
 can


start.
 Well,
 when
 when
 I
 built
 Manurva


University,
 um
 we
 identified
 more
 than


80
 of
 these
 skills
 and
 competencies


which
 made
 up
 our
 core
 curriculum.
 And


the
 reality
 is
 that
 in
 order
 to
 be
 able


to
 understand
 the
 world
 around
 you,
 you


cannot
 really
 distill


your
 uh
 your
 needs,
 your
 capabilities


into
 something
 very
 narrow.
 The
 reality


is
 you
 have
 to
 be
 a
 systems
 thinker.
 And


if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 understand


things
 systematically,
 you
 have
 to
 take


a
 proposed
 solution
 or
 a
 set
 of
 data,


you
 have
 to
 break
 it
 down
 into
 a


component
 parts
 that
 make
 sense.
 You


have
 to
 then
 be
 able
 to
 reformulate


those
 component
 parts
 and
 come
 up
 with
 a


unique
 solution.
 You
 have
 to
 take
 that


unique
 solution
 and
 understand
 what


happens
 when
 you
 actually
 implement
 it


in
 the
 real
 world.
 what
 are
 unintended


consequences
 or
 second
 or
 third
 order


effects
 that
 can
 come
 up
 withh
 with


that?
 And
 you
 have
 to
 then
 be
 able
 to


explain
 what
 it
 is
 that
 you've
 come
 up


with.
 Otherwise,
 anything
 you've
 come
 up


with
 is
 irrelevant.
 And
 that
 process
 has


dozens
 of
 skills
 that
 are
 built
 into
 it.


Dozens.
 And
 you
 not
 only
 have
 to
 know


what
 those
 skills
 are,
 you
 not
 only
 have


to
 be
 able
 to
 become
 an
 expert
 at


deploying
 them,
 but
 you
 have
 to
 be
 able


to
 know
 how
 to
 deploy
 them
 in
 radically


different
 context
 because
 you
 don't
 know


what
 is
 the
 context
 that
 you're
 going
 to


encounter
 it
 in.
 And
 in
 order
 to
 do


that,
 that
 takes
 years
 of
 study,


practice,
 and
 deliberate


recontextualization.


And
 that's
 of
 course
 what
 what
 we've


done
 at
 Manurva,
 but
 it
 is
 not
 how


traditional
 education
 institutions
 are


are
 set
 up.


>> Esther,
 you
 about
 to
 say
 something?


>> Well,
 I


Yes.
 I
 think
 that
 all
 kids
 coming
 out
 of


school
 don't
 have
 enough
 training
 for


social
 emotional
 skills.
 They
 don't
 know


how
 to
 work
 with
 each
 other.
 And
 so


that's
 why
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 important


to
 work
 with
 each
 other.
 And
 one
 of
 the


things
 Google
 focuses
 on
 is
 teamwork
 and


working
 with
 other
 people
 in
 on
 the


team.
 And
 some
 of
 the
 most
 amazing
 ideas


have
 come
 out
 of
 teamwork.
 But
 you
 have


to
 practice.
 You
 you
 know
 as
 a
 child
 you


learn
 these
 skills
 as
 a
 child
 and
 that's


why
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 important
 for


them
 to
 work
 together
 in
 teams.


>> Yes.
 I
 was
 I
 was
 actually
 going
 to
 build


on
 on
 Ether
 uh
 Esther's
 comment.
 So


right
 now
 with
 the
 rise
 of
 AI,
 we


clearly
 have
 an
 increase
 in
 the
 need
 for


all
 of
 us
 to
 be
 actually
 increasingly


human.
 Uh
 so
 human
 skills
 are
 on
 the


rise.
 Certainly
 the
 concept
 of


collaboration
 or
 what
 I
 call
 relational


intelligence
 is
 on
 the
 rise.
 um
 as
 our


economies
 will
 be
 increasingly
 already


uh
 uh
 demanding
 communication


collaboration
 as
 top
 skills.


The
 second
 element
 is
 adaptability.


Um,
 which
 gets
 a
 little
 bit
 to
 what
 Ben


described,
 but
 uh
 I
 think
 adaptability


will
 adaptability
 is
 actually
 very
 very


closely
 tied
 with
 creativity,


which
 is
 a
 skill
 that
 many
 of
 you


entrepreneurs
 have
 in
 this
 room.
 Um,
 but


this
 this
 concept
 of
 being
 adaptive
 is
 a


is
 one
 that
 we'll
 see
 more
 and
 more.
 And


then
 there
 is
 a
 third
 one
 which
 we


touched
 on
 already
 on
 throughout
 all
 all


these
 comments
 which
 is
 learning
 how
 to


learn.


>> I
 mean
 this
 capacity
 this
 metacognition


uh
 that
 we
 humans
 hold
 uh
 will
 continue


being
 increasingly
 important.
 So


question
 is
 then
 how
 do
 we
 teach
 more
 of


those
 skills
 but
 uh
 those
 three
 I
 think


will
 continue
 rising.


So
 can
 I
 just
 say
 that
 most
 companies


that
 fail
 most
 startups
 so
 90%
 of
 them


fail
 and
 you
 know
 the
 main
 reason
 they


fail
 lack
 of
 communication
 skills
 lack


of
 people
 being
 able
 to
 get
 along
 so
 if


they
 fail
 for
 that
 reason
 why
 aren't
 we


teaching
 those
 skills
 why
 why
 are


universities
 not
 allowing
 kids
 to
 have


more
 interaction
 and
 social
 skills
 so
 um


that's
 you
 know
 I
 also
 recommend
 that


everybody
 that
 he
 read
 John
 Door's
 book.


Do
 you
 know
 who
 John
 Door
 is?
 Yeah.
 So,


because
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 to
 learn


how
 to
 empower
 the
 people
 you
 work
 with.


You
 know,
 the
 leader
 is
 really
 important


and
 that
 the
 person
 needs
 to
 learn
 how


to
 empower
 the
 people
 that
 they
 are


working
 with
 and
 that
 is
 involved
 in


social
 emotional
 training.


I
 totally
 agree
 with
 all
 the
 skills
 and


competencies
 capabilities
 you
 three
 just


mentioned
 and
 I
 think
 to
 help
 our


learners
 to
 develop
 all
 those


capabilities
 and
 the
 competencies
 uh
 we


need
 to
 give
 them
 guidance
 um
 advice


support
 and
 also
 inspirations
 and
 we
 all


know
 those
 are
 the
 things
 um
 that
 our


great
 teachers
 are
 always
 good
 at
 uh


providing.
 Uh
 but
 talking
 about


teachers,
 uh
 we
 also
 uh
 heard
 something


from
 the
 uh
 video
 clip
 saying
 some


classrooms
 uh
 has
 no
 teachers
 at
 all.
 Um


so
 um
 actually
 like
 I've
 heard
 more
 and


more
 concerns
 these
 days
 about
 whether


um
 in
 the
 future
 AI
 will
 completely


eventually
 replace
 all
 the
 teachers
 in


the
 classrooms.
 So
 I'd
 like
 to
 hear


what's
 your
 take
 on
 this.
 Maybe
 I
 can


start
 from
 uh
 Esther
 as
 you
 have
 been
 a


teacher
 for
 many
 many
 years.


>> I
 think
 the
 role
 of
 the
 teacher
 is


really
 important
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 that


that
 technology
 can
 take
 over
 the
 role


of
 the
 teacher.
 You
 need
 a
 human
 being


there.
 So
 I
 do
 think
 that
 a
 lot
 of


additional
 skills
 can
 be
 learned
 but
 I


think
 the
 teacher
 needs
 to
 be
 there
 and


support
 the
 students
 and
 help
 them


understand
 what
 they're
 doing.
 even
 if


it's
 um
 you
 know
 just
 a
 small
 percentage


of
 the
 time.
 Uh
 maybe
 the
 teacher
 could


be
 called
 a
 coach.
 You
 know
 that's
 what


some
 of
 the
 people
 are
 saying.
 My


classes
 were
 very
 very
 large.
 They
 were


70
 kids
 in
 one
 class.
 And
 the
 reason


that
 they
 were
 that
 big
 is
 the
 kids


worked
 in
 teams.
 Every
 group
 there
 were


teams
 of
 four
 and
 five
 in
 every
 group.


And
 so
 it
 was
 easy
 for
 me
 to
 call
 roll


because,
 you
 know,
 you
 just
 call
 team


one,
 team
 two,
 and
 so
 forth.
 But
 they


also
 learned
 a
 lot
 about
 how
 to
 get


along
 with
 each
 other.
 And
 I'll
 tell


you,
 when
 they're
 in
 the
 ninth
 grade,


they
 don't
 know
 how.
 By
 the
 time
 they're


in
 the
 12th
 grade,
 if
 they've
 been
 doing


this
 long
 enough,
 they
 know
 how.


>> Isaba.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 our
 brains
 are
 deeply


deeply
 social.
 Uh
 we
 are
 wired
 to


connect
 as
 a
 human
 species.
 So
 we
 need


um
 human
 relationships
 around
 us


including
 teachers
 and
 other
 other


people,
 peers
 uh
 other
 people


surrounding
 us
 for
 all
 of
 us
 to
 learn


and
 to
 thrive.
 Um
 actually
 isolation
 is


connected
 to
 major
 mental
 health
 issues


um
 which
 we
 are
 already
 seeing.
 So
 uh


anyway
 relationships
 matter
 tremendously


for
 learning
 and
 thriving.
 Um
 and
 I
 also


believe
 very
 similar
 to
 my
 friend
 Esther


that
 uh
 teachers
 are
 here
 to
 stay.
 Uh
 we


need
 teachers
 um
 uh
 we
 need
 to
 equip


teachers
 with
 the
 right
 AI
 tools
 so
 that


AI
 can
 actually
 support
 teachers
 in
 u
 in


being
 increasingly
 uh
 more
 relational
 uh


by
 maybe
 helping
 on
 some
 admin
 tasks
 and


things
 that
 uh
 can
 free
 up
 time.
 Um
 but


teachers
 are
 here
 to
 stay
 because
 our


brains
 are
 deeply
 deeply
 social
 as


humans.
 The
 whole
 of
 teachers
 may
 evolve


as
 the
 way
 that
 we
 are
 transferring


knowledge
 may
 evolve
 with
 some
 of
 these


technologies.
 Um
 but
 the
 idea
 of
 one


tutor,
 one
 child,
 one
 AI
 tutor,
 one


child
 without
 any
 human
 relationships,
 I


don't
 see
 that
 vision
 myself.
 uh
 because


that
 would
 be
 a
 world
 where
 I
 don't
 want


to
 live
 in.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 my


children
 live
 in
 uh
 in
 this
 world
 where


they
 are
 not
 connected
 with
 other
 humans


where
 they
 are
 uh
 not
 flourishing.
 Um
 so


um
 I
 I
 think
 that
 teachers
 will
 remain


and
 um
 AI
 will
 hopefully
 make
 actually


teaching
 one
 of
 the
 best
 profession
 it


has
 ever
 been.


I'll
 give
 you
 a
 mathematical
 um
 or


statistical
 response
 to
 that
 question.


Teachers
 like
 any
 population
 are


distributed
 around
 a
 normal
 curve.
 Um


the
 only
 problem
 is
 that
 the
 midpoint
 of


the
 normal
 curve
 of
 teaching
 is


ineffective.


That's
 a
 fact.
 The
 fact
 of
 the
 matter
 is


is
 that
 anybody
 here
 can
 think
 about
 a


class
 you
 took
 in
 college,
 assuming
 it


wasn't
 last
 semester,
 and
 if
 a
 final


exam
 were
 to
 be
 produced
 this
 instant


and
 I
 would
 time
 you
 on
 passing
 that


exam,
 you
 would
 all
 flunk
 because
 you


didn't
 learn
 it.


And
 so,
 and
 that
 is
 true
 of
 high
 school,


that
 is
 true
 of
 middle
 school.
 It's
 not


true
 of
 elementary
 school.
 you
 do
 wind


up
 learning
 to
 read,
 write,
 um
 do
 basic


math.


But
 the
 problem
 with
 a
 normal


distribution
 where
 your
 midpoint
 is


ineffective
 is
 you've
 got
 to
 get
 a


standard
 deviation
 away
 from
 the
 mean
 in


order
 to
 get
 to
 good
 teaching.
 And
 that


means
 that
 one
 standard
 deviation
 uh


from
 the
 mean
 in
 one
 direction
 and
 above


is
 roughly
 16
 17%.


16
 17%
 of
 teachers
 are
 good
 or
 supremely


good
 extraordinary


problem
 is
 more
 than
 80%
 are
 ineffective


or
 much
 worse


so
 long
 as
 that
 is
 the
 case
 AI
 will


replace
 teachers


and
 if
 we
 reform
 the
 system


to
 actually
 allow
 teachers
 to
 have
 that


midpoint
 become
 effective


>> where
 more
 than
 80%
 are
 effective
 to


great
 and
 less
 than
 20%
 are
 bad
 to


terrible
 then
 there
 will
 be
 a
 role
 for


teachers
 in
 the
 future.


>> I
 can't
 agree
 more
 on
 what
 Ben
 just


shared
 with
 us.
 Uh
 my
 personal
 view
 I


think
 AI
 won't
 completely
 replace
 all


the
 teachers
 especially
 those
 good


teachers
 and
 AI
 will
 empower
 them
 to


make
 them
 even
 better.
 Um
 but
 AI
 um
 like


teachers
 they
 do
 not
 know
 about
 AI
 or


they
 do
 not
 know
 how
 to
 use
 technologies


they
 will
 be
 replaced
 by
 teachers
 who
 do


okay
 actually
 um
 our
 time
 is
 up
 um
 I


think
 AI
 and
 education
 is
 such
 a
 big


topic
 we
 can't
 finish
 uh
 the


conversation
 within
 30
 40
 minutes
 and
 I


hope
 our
 panel
 has
 uh
 given
 you
 guys


some
 new
 perspectives
 and
 also
 some
 uh


advice
 to
 carry
 forward
 and
 thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 your
 insights
 and
 uh


perspectives
 and
 also
 of
 wisdom
 and
 I


hope
 you
 guys
 enjoy
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 uh


event.
 Thank
 you.
