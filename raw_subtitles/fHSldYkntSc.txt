All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 close.


We
 are
 live.
 We
 have
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about


today.
 Uh,
 bunch
 of
 things
 have
 happened


since
 the
 market
 open,
 especially
 in
 the


world
 of
 AI.
 It's
 hard
 to
 believe,
 but


the
 S&P
 500
 actually
 got
 50
 cents
 away


from
 hitting
 alltime
 highs.
 We're
 at


68827.


And
 again,
 given
 the
 price
 action
 today,


Robin
 Hood
 crushed
 down
 9%,
 Nvidia
 down


2%,
 Broadcom,
 it
 was
 down
 below
 400.
 So,


getting
 a
 little bit
 of
 recovery
 right


here
 at
 405,
 down
 only
 2%
 on
 the
 day.


Google
 getting
 hit
 because
 OpenAI


released
 a
 new
 model.
 We'll
 talk
 about


that.
 But
 it's
 hard
 to
 believe
 the
 S&P


is
 relatively
 close
 to
 all-time
 highs,


but
 it
 is
 it
 is
 very
 close
 to
 all-time


highs.
 So,
 it's
 very
 wonky
 price
 action


that
 we'll
 discuss
 today.
 And
 the
 next


15
 minutes,
 we're
 going to
 have


Broadcom,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 Costco,


and
 we're
 going to
 have
 Lululemon.
 So,
 I


would
 imagine
 most
 portfolios
 today


don't
 look
 as
 red
 as
 they
 looked
 at
 in


the
 morning.
 Um,
 lots
 of
 names
 that
 are


making
 some
 really
 interesting


recoveries,
 potentially
 some
 of
 them


hitting
 50-y
 week
 highs.
 The
 cruise


lines
 doing
 great.
 the
 financials
 doing


incredible.
 Amcor
 freaking
 hitting
 47.
 I


think
 that's
 a
 52
 week
 high
 on
 Amcor.


SoFi
 getting
 back
 up
 to
 2017.
 But
 then


you
 got
 other
 names
 like
 Robin
 Hood


which
 are
 just
 getting
 crushed
 today


down
 9%.
 Which
 doesn't
 make
 a
 lot
 of


sense
 given
 the
 S&P
 500
 is
 hitting
 all


time
 high.
 So
 maybe
 there's
 something


else
 going
 on
 that's
 causing
 that.


Nvidia
 doesn't
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.
 Down


1.82%.
 Oracle
 was
 down
 17%
 at
 the
 worst.


Now
 it's
 only
 down
 10%.
 So
 we're


covering
 that
 7%
 which
 is
 good
 for


Oracle.
 But
 that
 one's
 still
 just
 below


200.
 It
 did
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 above
 200.


Right
 now
 it
 is
 down.
 Rocket
 Lab,
 I


think
 this
 is
 honestly
 the
 story
 of
 the


day.
 We'll
 get
 into
 a
 lot
 of the
 AI


headlines
 we
 have,
 but
 my
 goodness,
 11%


on
 the
 day.
 Three
 words,
 data
 centers
 in


space.
 Whether
 it's
 real,
 whether
 it's
 a


fantasy,
 whether
 it's
 a
 narrative,


whether
 it's
 just
 something
 that
 the


street
 is
 excited
 about
 because
 it
 might


be
 the
 way
 to
 play
 the
 SpaceX
 IPO
 uh
 or


at least
 the
 way
 to
 justify
 the
 SpaceX


IPO
 at
 1.5
 trillion.
 Rocket
 Lab
 is
 being


seen
 as
 the
 core
 beneficiary
 and
 ASU


although
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 having
 as


big
 of
 a
 day
 as
 Rocket
 Lab
 as
 well
 7%


that's
 still
 a
 pretty
 good
 day
 for
 AS
 uh


both
 of
 the
 space
 names
 just
 getting
 a


massive
 move.
 Planet
 Labs
 also
 had
 um


earnings
 yesterday.
 So
 those
 guys
 also


getting
 a
 move
 up
 35%
 after
 good


earnings
 and
 being
 pretty
 much
 in
 the


best
 niche
 you
 could
 be
 in
 over
 the
 past


couple
 days
 which
 is
 space
 rock
 lab


right
 there
 64.
 So
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 going
 on


a
 lot
 of
 earnings
 after
 the
 bell.
 We


will
 get
 into
 everything.
 Uh
 [laughter]


Barzov,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Data
 centers
 in
 space
 is
 four
 words.
 If


you
 separate
 data
 and
 centers,
 if
 you


put
 them
 together,
 which
 is
 data
 center


one
 word?
 I
 don't
 know.
 It
 has
 to
 be
 a


word
 at
 this
 point.
 After
 three
 years
 of


this
 AI
 revolution,
 data
 centers
 has
 to


be
 one
 word.
 Then
 uh
 then
 it
 becomes


becomes
 three
 words.
 But
 it
 really
 is
 a


narrative
 that
 has
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 people


excited.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 you're


getting
 some
 of
 the
 momentum
 that
 we're


seeing.
 Now,
 after
 the
 bell,
 I'm
 going


to
 have
 Sam
 join
 me
 and
 we're
 going
 to


cover
 Broadcom,
 Costco,
 and
 Lulu.


However,
 we
 are
 not
 going
 to
 be


listening
 to
 any
 of
 the
 earnings
 calls,


quite
 frankly,
 because
 they're
 all
 going


to
 be
 boring.
 Broadcom
 is
 not
 going to


be
 super
 exciting.
 So,
 by
 4:30,
 I
 think


we'll
 get
 all
 the
 numbers.
 We
 will
 have


Chris
 join,
 potentially,
 Steve
 join,
 and


we
 will
 get
 into
 Macro
 Thursday.
 We


haven't
 been
 able
 to
 do
 Macro
 Thursday


for
 the
 past
 two
 weeks
 simply
 because
 of


uh
 all
 the
 earnings
 that
 have
 been


taking
 place.
 So,
 we'll
 get
 Chris
 on.


Chris
 is
 now
 bullish
 Nvidia.
 This
 guy's


posted
 like
 17
 things
 today
 about
 why


he's
 long
 Nvidia.
 So
 we'll
 talk
 about


kind
 of
 why
 and
 how
 he
 became
 bullish
 in


video.
 And
 then
 we
 will
 also
 talk
 about


um
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 state
 of
 AI


from
 a
 AI
 deflation
 perspective
 infl
 uh


the
 overall
 inflation
 versus
 labor


market
 and
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 the
 Fed.


So
 after
 we
 get
 those
 earnings
 which


will
 be
 happening
 in
 about
 basically
 10


minutes
 um
 then
 we'll
 get
 deeper
 into


what's
 going
 on
 with
 Nvidia
 and
 the


state
 of
 the
 A
 right.
 Wow,
 look
 at
 the


S&P
 500.
 Look
 at
 that
 candle
 689.
 Again,


it
 doesn't
 feel
 like
 it,
 right?
 You


would
 think
 S&P
 500
 a
 dollar
 away
 from


less
 than
 a
 dollar
 away
 from
 alltime


highs
 would
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 other


names
 really
 running.
 It's
 not
 the
 case,


but
 technically
 that's
 kind
 of
 bullish


because
 you're
 seeing
 a
 bit
 of
 a


rotation
 into
 some
 some
 of
 these
 other


sectors.
 Uh
 but
 you
 do
 have
 the
 S&P
 500


right
 here
 trying
 to
 get
 to
 alltime


highs.
 Speaking
 of
 rotation,
 let's


listen
 to
 Tom
 Lee.
 This
 is
 his
 official


2026
 outlook
 for
 the
 S&P
 500.
 He's
 not


the
 most
 bullish
 tech
 going
 into
 next


year.
 He's
 bullish,
 but
 he
 thinks


there's
 going
 to
 be
 other
 categories


that
 participate.
 And
 you're
 kind
 of


seeing
 that
 today
 with
 tech
 down,
 but


the
 rest
 of
 the
 market
 continuing
 to
 go


higher.


>> Next
 year,
 the
 real
 message
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 year
 will
 be
 there's
 the
 Fed
 put


back
 in
 play.
 So
 then
 you
 have
 a
 White


House
 put
 and
 a
 Fed
 put,
 which
 are


tailwinds
 for
 stocks.
 But
 before
 all


that
 happens,
 the
 Fed
 has
 to
 the
 new


chairman
 has
 to
 be
 confirmed.
 It
 takes


about
 90
 days
 from
 the
 time
 that
 his


nomination
 takes
 place
 in
 the


confirmation
 and
 the
 markets
 always
 test


a
 new
 Fed
 chair.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 that
 is


the
 January
 to
 October
 period
 is
 that


the
 Fed
 is
 being
 tested
 even
 though
 we


know
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 dovish
 Fed
 and
 a


Fed
 put
 out
 of
 that.


>> We
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 I
 mean
 at


least
 if
 you
 believe
 the
 outlook
 which


that's
 you
 know
 it's
 your
 own


prerogative.
 Um
 a
 cut
 into
 a


strengthening
 economy
 though.
 I
 [snorts]


mean
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day
 that


supersedes
 everything.
 Isn't
 that
 partly


what
 the
 last
 couple
 of
 days
 yesterday


and
 today
 are
 about?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 this
 was
 a
 in
 in
 my
 mind,


even
 though
 people
 positioned
 it
 as
 a


hawkish
 cut,
 it's
 actually
 quite
 bullish


for
 stocks
 because
 um
 the
 Fed
 again
 is


now
 weighing
 the
 downside
 risk
 to
 the


economy,
 which
 is
 the
 Fed
 put
 coming


back
 into
 play.
 Plus,
 as
 you
 know,
 QT


ended,
 and
 even
 though
 it's
 not


officially
 QE,
 it's
 the
 absence
 of


tightening,
 which
 is
 QE.
 I
 mean,
 you


call
 it
 whatever
 you
 want.
 Um,
 if
 the


effects
 of
 whatever
 they're
 doing
 are


nearly
 the
 same
 as
 if
 you
 want
 to
 call


it
 QE,
 the
 bottom
 line
 is
 stocks
 went
 up


and
 rates
 came
 down.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 if
 that
 continues
 to
 be
 the
 picture,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 hard
 to
 lean
 against


the
 equity
 market
 in
 that
 scenario.


>> Correct.
 And
 and
 the
 right
 groups
 are


responding
 as
 you
 highlighted,
 small


caps
 hitting
 record
 highs,
 um
 financials


rallying,
 and
 now
 what
 we
 just
 want
 is


the
 ISM
 to
 turn.
 But
 if
 housing
 can


turn,
 then
 you've
 got
 a
 real
 broadening


taking
 place
 next
 year.


>> See,
 when
 you
 still
 talk
 about
 a
 wall
 of


worry.
 Um,
 I
 feel
 like
 that's
 debatable


now.
 I
 mean,
 I
 felt
 like
 it's
 debatable


for
 the
 last
 few
 months,
 but
 once
 you


get
 into
 the
 new
 year,
 do
 we
 really
 have


a
 wall
 of
 worry?
 As
 I
 said,
 we
 expect


the
 economy
 to
 strengthen.
 The
 Fed's


going
 to
 have
 a
 more
 dovish
 tilt.
 even


with
 a
 a
 new
 person,
 you're
 going
 to


have
 some
 of
 the
 impacts
 of
 the
 the
 big


beautiful
 bill.
 You're
 going
 to
 have


what
 should
 be
 a
 better
 environment
 for


M&A
 and
 even
 IPOs.
 We
 may
 get
 some
 of


the
 largest
 we've
 ever
 seen
 from
 the
 AI


space,
 not
 to
 mention
 the
 AI
 trade
 in


and
 of
 itself.
 Is
 that
 really
 a
 wall
 of


worry?


>> Well,
 those
 are
 definitely
 all


tailwinds,
 Scott,
 but
 in
 our


conversations
 with
 clients,
 we
 find


skepticism
 about
 valuations.


>> Okay.


>> Fears
 of
 an
 AI
 bubble.


>> Fair.
 Uh
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 overturning


tariffs
 does
 create
 turmoil
 at
 a
 time


when
 the
 midterms
 are
 now
 in
 people's


minds.


>> Would
 that
 be
 a
 plus
 for
 stocks?


>> Well,
 it
 is
 and
 it
 isn't
 because
 now
 it


makes
 policy
 uncertain
 again
 and
 the


economic
 ripple
 effects
 uncertain


because
 if
 the
 tariffs
 stay
 in
 place
 and


remember
 markets
 don't
 expect
 the


tariffs
 to
 hold,
 then
 we
 can
 anniversary


a
 lot
 of
 the
 effects.
 But
 if
 now
 we're


talking
 about
 them
 being
 reversed,
 some


companies
 suing
 to
 get
 refunds
 and
 then


new
 tariffs
 coming,
 it
 adds
 to
 the
 lack


of
 visibility.


>> So
 on
 the
 issue,


>> okay,
 so
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 comments
 from


Tom
 there.
 If
 we
 were
 to
 sum
 it
 up,


essentially
 what
 Tom
 is
 saying
 right


there
 is
 he
 expects
 about
 10%
 upside
 for


the
 S&P
 500
 next
 year,
 7,700.
 He
 said


there's
 a
 Fed
 put
 because
 the
 Fed


obviously
 cares
 more
 about
 the
 labor


market
 than
 inflation,
 which
 is
 very


important.
 He
 says
 small
 caps
 and


financials
 are
 hitting
 record
 highs,


which
 he's
 right
 about.
 JP
 Morgan,


Goldman
 Sachs,
 Goldman
 Sachs
 literally


at
 a
 record
 high
 today
 and
 IWWM
 hitting


all-time
 highs.
 You
 know,
 Tom
 Le's
 been


bullish
 small
 caps
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 So


those
 parts
 of
 the
 broadening
 equation


of
 this
 economy
 again,
 it
 sucks
 that


Nvidia
 is
 not
 hitting
 all-time
 highs,


but
 it
 doesn't
 suck
 that
 the
 S&P
 is


being
 supported
 by
 other
 things
 that


are,
 even
 if
 Nvidia
 is
 not.
 And
 quite


frankly,
 it's
 probably
 healthy
 that


that's
 the
 case.
 The
 wall
 of
 worry,
 he


says,
 is
 supported
 by
 a
 fear
 of
 an
 AI


bubble
 and
 this
 whole
 Supreme
 Court


overturning
 tariffs.
 And
 then
 he
 thinks


that
 tech
 is
 gonna
 digest
 the
 gains
 from


this
 year
 into
 early
 next
 year
 which
 is


actually
 going
 to
 lead
 to
 bearish


sentiment
 around
 tech
 if
 Nvidia,
 Amazon


and
 Meta
 stay
 flat
 over
 the
 next
 6


months
 which
 is
 going
 to
 be
 strong
 for


the
 broadening
 thesis
 and
 eventually


will
 continue
 to
 support
 the
 wall
 of


worry
 which
 actually
 allows
 the
 S&P
 to


make
 that
 run
 to
 7700
 and
 then
 Nvidia,


Meta,
 Amazon,
 etc.
 those
 will
 catch
 up.


So,
 I
 mean,
 it's
 quite
 the
 thesis
 and


maybe
 it's
 completely
 wrong
 and
 tech


just
 leads
 the
 way
 next
 year
 or
 maybe


it's
 spot
 on.
 But
 we're
 going
 to
 find


out
 over
 the
 coming
 months
 and


definitely
 over
 the
 coming
 weeks
 as
 we


get
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 and
 we
 see


how
 this
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 S&P
 500


right
 there
 68831
 as
 that
 is
 now
 up
 0.1%


on
 the
 day.
 Thank
 you,
 Mr.
 Derek
 Wall,


for
 the
 gifted
 50
 memberships.
 50
 of
 you


guys
 just
 got
 a
 gifted
 membership


courtesy
 of
 Mr.
 Derek
 Wall.
 Derek,
 thank


you
 for
 being
 here.
 Again,
 if
 you
 get
 a


membership,
 it's
 uh
 you
 don't
 get


anything
 special.
 Your
 name
 just
 lights


up
 and
 it
 just
 supports
 the
 channel.
 So,


thank
 you,
 Derek,
 for
 being
 here.
 Yeah,


Derek
 was
 Santa
 Claus
 today.
 [laughter]


Basically,
 Derek
 was
 Santa
 today.
 And
 50


guys
 just
 got
 those
 memberships.
 S&P


right
 there,
 688.
 Lulu
 earnings
 today


down.3%.
 You
 got
 Broadcom
 that's
 up
 80%


for
 the
 year.
 That's
 at
 406,
 down
 1.7.


And
 then
 Costco.
 Uh
 let
 me
 know
 in
 the


chat
 if
 anyone
 owns
 these
 names.
 These


are
 going to
 be
 what
 we
 have
 to
 see


after
 the
 bell
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 the


street
 is
 looking
 for.
 Broadcom
 is
 the


most
 important
 one
 in
 my
 opinion.
 Lulu


is
 important
 for
 like
 the
 retailer


trade,
 which
 that's
 fine,
 but
 Broadcom


is
 really
 important
 for
 the
 overall
 AI


trade.
 The
 Street
 wants
 1.87
 of
 EPS
 for


Broadcom,
 17.4
 billion
 in
 revenue.


Street
 wants
 2.48
 billion
 for
 Lulu,
 2.2


of
 EPS,
 and
 then
 Street
 wants
 427
 of
 EPS


and
 67
 billion
 of
 revenue
 from
 Costco.


In
 about
 5
 minutes,
 we're
 going
 to
 see


what
 that
 ends
 up
 turning
 out
 to
 be.
 Uh


Jensen
 Hong
 to
 Time
 magazine,
 so
 the
 two


AI
 headlines
 that
 we
 had
 today,
 for


those
 that
 didn't
 see
 it,
 uh
 he
 said,


"There's
 a
 belief
 that
 the
 world's
 GDP


is
 somehow
 limited
 at
 a
 100red
 trillion.


AI
 is
 going
 to
 cause
 that
 100red


trillion
 to
 become
 500
 trillion."


Obviously,
 he's
 talking
 his
 book
 here,


but
 if
 Jensen's
 right
 about
 this
 and


Broadcom
 is
 going to
 give
 us
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 sneak
 peek
 of
 if
 we
 can
 get
 to


that
 500
 trillion
 eventually,
 then
 yeah,


we're
 talking
 about
 massive
 GDP
 growth


and
 that
 massive
 GDP
 growth
 would
 be


contingent
 based
 on
 what
 is
 happening
 in


the
 world
 of
 AI.
 Uh,
 another
 reason
 that


we
 might
 get
 to
 a
 much
 larger
 GDP


projection
 in
 the
 name
 of
 AI
 is
 because


of
 OpenAI
 5.2.
 It's
 out
 today.
 So
 the


main
 headline
 on
 GBT
 and
 opening
 eye
 was


that
 they
 were
 partnering
 with
 Disney.


By
 the
 way,
 I
 forgot
 or
 I
 found
 out


today
 that
 Bob
 Iger,
 CEO
 of
 Disney,
 is


an
 LP,
 a
 limited
 partner
 in
 a
 massive
 VC


fund
 called
 Thrive
 Capital
 that
 has
 a


pretty
 big
 investment
 in
 OpenAI.
 So
 I


just
 thought
 that
 was
 kind
 of


interesting
 that
 we
 see
 the
 partnership


today.
 Then
 you
 see
 where
 Bob
 Iger's


investments
 are.
 Remember
 Bob
 Iger
 is


out
 next
 year
 as
 the
 CEO
 of
 Disney.
 So


you
 know
 he's
 going to
 have
 his
 own


investments
 to
 worry
 about
 and
 not


necessarily
 have
 to
 manage
 Disney.
 That


was
 a
 big
 partnership
 today
 to
 license


the
 IP
 of
 Disney
 characters
 into
 OpenAI.


Uh
 and
 then
 on
 the
 same
 day
 they


released
 GPT
 5.2.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 and


the
 Disney
 announcement
 today
 were
 their


response
 to
 this
 kind
 of
 code
 red
 Gemini


3
 situation.
 And
 based
 on
 the
 bench


benchmarks,
 it's
 better
 than
 Gemini
 3.
 I


haven't
 tried
 it
 yet.
 I
 I
 don't
 even


think
 I've
 gotten
 the
 update
 on
 GPT
 5.2


yet,
 but
 uh
 it's
 better
 theoretically


than
 Gemini
 3.
 So
 either
 this
 is
 going


to
 be
 every
 LLM
 racing
 to
 the
 bottom
 and


the
 cost
 to
 train
 and
 ultimately
 the


cost
 to
 inference
 is
 going
 to
 go


essentially
 to
 zero
 because
 they're
 all


training
 on
 this
 stuff
 and
 every
 LLM
 is


going
 to
 be
 like
 the
 other
 one
 or
 it's


going
 to
 legitimately
 be
 one
 is
 so
 much


better
 than
 the
 others
 and
 it
 wins
 the


entire
 market.
 I'm
 skeptical
 that
 the


latter
 is
 going
 to
 happen
 over
 the


former.
 But
 nonetheless,
 they're
 going


to
 be
 fighting
 pretty
 hard
 to
 win


supremacy
 in
 the
 LLM
 race
 and
 that
 is


going
 to
 be
 bullish
 for
 Broadcom,


Nvidia,
 AMD,
 etc.
 All
 the
 chip
 names
 in


that
 ecosystem.
 All
 right,
 folks.
 Here


we
 go.
 Big
 big
 earnings.
 It
 is
 Thursday,


December
 11th,
 400
 p.m.
 The
 stock
 market


is
 now
 closed.
 And
 although
 it
 doesn't


feel
 like
 it,
 we
 just
 had
 our
 highest


close
 ever
 at
 68912


on
 the
 S&P
 500.


[music]


>> [music]


>> All
 right,
 we
 are
 done
 for
 the
 day.
 I


mean,
 it's
 bullish,
 right?
 S&P
 is


literally
 less
 than
 50
 cents
 away
 from


alltime
 high
 68912,
 but
 that
 rotation


was
 uh
 evident
 today
 as
 it
 was
 not


necessarily
 in
 the
 tech
 stocks.
 Oracle


down
 10%
 on
 the
 day.
 Nvidia
 was
 down


about
 1.5%
 on
 the
 day.
 Rocket
 Lab


absolutely
 massive
 day
 that
 was
 up


10.45%.
 45%.
 There
 you
 go.
 6353.
 Got
 to


64.
 It
 was
 also
 up
 uh
 5%
 yesterday.


Rocket
 Lab
 is
 now
 up
 39%


for
 the
 week.
 40%
 move
 on
 Rocket
 Lab
 in


the
 past
 week,
 which
 is
 quite


incredible.
 Iran
 actually
 inched
 out
 a


little
 bit
 of
 green
 as
 we
 got
 into
 the


close.
 Nebas
 right
 there,
 that's
 up
 74%.


Again,
 Broadcom
 that
 was
 down
 about


1.6%.
 Planet
 Labs
 was
 up
 34%.
 Meta
 got


to
 go
 green
 by
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 652.


Apple
 as
 well
 at
 278.
 Tesla
 446,
 that


was
 down
 1%.
 Grab
 was
 basically
 flat
 on


the
 day
 at
 518.
 TSM
 down
 1.43.
 You
 had


Baba
 that
 was
 down
 1.22
 and
 then
 Shopify


that
 was
 also
 down
 about
 2.18%
 on
 the


day
 and
 then
 Amcor
 hit
 52
 week
 highs
 at


47.
 Now
 in
 terms
 of
 Hood
 again
 the


explanation
 I
 had
 in
 the
 morning
 was


that
 the
 market
 was
 going
 kind
 of


bearish
 and
 that's
 why
 Hood
 went
 down.


Market
 ended
 up
 going
 pretty
 bullish


towards
 the
 end
 of the
 day
 at least
 in


terms
 of
 the
 rotation.
 So
 I
 think
 the


the
 better
 way
 to
 explain
 it
 is
 two


things.
 A,
 crypto,
 which
 although
 crypto


is
 recovering,
 it
 still
 is
 down


substantially
 from
 where
 it
 was


yesterday.
 B,
 there's
 someone
 who's


selling
 and
 it's
 probably
 a
 larger


institution.
 Maybe
 it's
 an
 insider.
 I


think
 we'll
 find
 out
 in
 the
 coming
 days,


but
 I
 mean,
 a
 9%
 move
 after
 things
 end


up
 going
 green.
 It's
 probably
 some
 type


of
 an
 insider
 sell.
 I
 know
 some
 people


are
 saying
 the
 November
 metrics
 were
 the


best.
 Yes,
 they
 weren't
 the
 best,
 but


they
 were
 not
 bad.
 And
 I
 think
 people


are
 painting
 it
 as
 like,
 oh,
 the


November
 metrics
 were
 horrible.
 It's


like,
 no,
 that's
 not
 the
 case.
 We
 went


through
 the
 metrics
 yesterday.
 The


November
 metrics
 were
 fine.
 So,
 I
 don't


think
 that's
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal.
 might


just
 be
 an
 insider
 or
 an
 inside


institution
 from
 years
 ago
 offloading


some
 shares.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 would
 be
 a


better
 explanation.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to


find
 out
 in
 the
 coming
 days
 if
 that
 is


the
 case
 and
 see
 if
 we
 can
 go
 from


there.
 All right,
 earnings.
 Broadcom,


Costco,
 and
 Lululemon.
 We
 should
 be


getting
 these
 earnings
 any
 second
 now.
 I


think
 Costco's
 actually
 at
 around
 420.


Lulu
 and
 Broadcom
 should
 be
 happening


relatively
 soon.


And
 we're
 going
 to
 see


what
 this
 one
 ends
 up
 playing
 out
 to
 be.


and
 then
 we'll
 get
 those
 earnings.
 Matt,


thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Sold
 my


first
 cover
 call
 on
 RocketLab
 contract


expiring
 the
 1975
 strike.
 Was
 it
 a
 bad


decision?
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 lose
 my


shares.
 Uh,
 so
 you
 have
 one
 week
 for


Rocket
 Lab
 to
 go
 from
 64
 to
 75.
 Just
 my


gut
 reaction
 is
 I
 think
 you're
 going to


be
 okay
 on
 that
 covered
 call.
 If
 it
 gets


close
 to
 75,
 you
 can
 always
 roll
 that


call.
 So
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 let
 those


shares
 get
 called
 away.
 Um,
 but
 I
 think


you'll
 be
 okay.
 Now
 granted,
 I
 didn't


expect
 Rocket
 Lab
 to
 go
 up
 10%
 in
 a
 day.


So
 maybe
 it
 continues
 to
 keep
 going,
 but


you
 have
 time.
 you
 know,
 you
 are
 well


below
 the
 strike
 price
 right
 now
 and
 if


you
 get
 any
 near
 anywhere
 near
 close
 to


it,
 you
 can
 roll
 out
 to
 like
 $80,
 $90


without
 having
 to
 pay
 too
 much
 of
 a


credit
 or
 paying
 too
 much
 of
 a
 debit.


You'll
 probably
 get
 a
 net
 credit
 and
 I


think
 you'll
 be
 okay.
 Rivian
 also


announced
 their
 own
 new
 chip
 today.


They're
 they're
 letting
 go
 of
 their


Nvidia
 architecture
 and
 building
 their


own
 in-house
 chip.
 I
 have
 not
 learned


that
 much
 about
 it,
 but
 Rivian
 was
 down


about
 6%
 on
 the
 day,
 but
 they
 did
 make


that
 announcement
 earlier
 uh
 during
 the


day.
 All right,
 earnings.
 Let's
 see.


Let's
 see
 what
 we've
 got.
 Don't
 think


they're
 out
 yet.
 They
 should
 be
 out
 very


soon.
 These
 are
 going
 to
 be
 the
 big


numbers
 we're
 looking
 for
 in
 the
 context


of
 Broadcom.
 Probably
 out
 at
 405.
 So,


we'll
 get
 those
 soon.
 The
 Dow
 closed
 at


record
 highs
 and
 the
 S&P
 500
 uh
 not
 at


record
 high,
 but
 the
 it
 is
 a
 record
 high


close
 for
 the
 S&P,
 which
 again,
 even
 if


it
 doesn't
 feel
 like
 it,
 is
 pretty


incredible
 to
 to
 see
 that
 here.
 Uh
 what


did
 people
 say
 in
 the
 chat
 in
 terms
 of


the
 poll?
 Let
 me
 pull
 that
 up.
 By
 the


way,
 Trump
 said
 he's
 thinking
 of
 getting


rid
 of
 taxes
 on
 gambling.
 So,
 if
 you
 win


money
 via
 gambling,
 like
 on
 a
 sports


book,
 uh
 Trump
 is
 thinking
 of
 getting


rid
 of
 taxes
 for
 that
 or
 if
 you
 know
 you


win
 money
 from
 Vegas
 or
 something.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 that's
 necessarily
 going


to
 get
 passed,
 but
 that
 is
 something


that
 he
 said
 today.
 I
 doubt
 it's
 going


to
 apply
 to
 prediction
 markets
 because


prediction
 markets,
 you
 know,
 although


people
 say
 it's
 gambling
 and
 in
 many


cases
 it
 is
 gambling,
 they
 are
 regulated


by
 the
 CFTC
 which
 means
 they
 are
 actual


futures
 contracts
 which
 end
 up
 getting


taxed
 like
 options,
 short-term
 gains
 on


options
 versus
 uh
 being
 classified
 as


like
 winnings
 from
 gamblings.
 All right,


Lulu
 I
 think
 we
 get
 in
 one
 minute
 at


405.
 So
 this
 one
 we
 should
 see
 soon
 and


Broadcom
 might
 be
 at
 410


and
 then
 we're
 gonna
 see
 what
 happens.


By
 the
 way,
 where
 was
 DraftKings
 on
 that


news?
 Did
 it
 move?
 Yeah,
 it
 moved
 about


1%
 today.
 Nothing
 too
 crazy.
 Amcor
 got


that
 $47
 close
 again.
 Rocklab
 made
 a
 big


move
 today.
 And
 then
 AS


putting
 itself
 up
 there
 in
 terms
 of
 a


data
 center
 play
 for
 space
 uh
 as
 an


infrastructure
 for
 satellites,
 satellite


communication.
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 of these


names,
 if
 you're
 in
 the
 space,
 if
 you're


in
 the
 niche
 of
 space
 in
 the
 stock


market,
 you're
 catching
 a
 bit.
 And
 AS


already
 has
 like
 a
 fundamental
 thesis


around
 it,
 but
 this
 one
 got
 another
 big


move
 today,
 7%.
 on
 the
 day.
 All right,


Lulu
 earnings
 should
 be
 out
 any
 second.


Let's
 see
 what
 we
 get.
 Lulu,
 she's
 down


down
 1%.
 Lulu


is
 down
 2.2.
 She
 continues
 to
 go
 down.


Broadcom
 I
 think
 we
 have
 in
 five


minutes.
 Lulu
 right
 there
 2.9
 3.4.


Remember
 Bur
 is
 long
 Lulu.
 This
 is
 his


big
 bet
 along
 with
 Shift
 4
 and
 Molina


Healthcare.
 I
 think
 these
 are
 the
 names


that
 he
 is
 long
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 actual


names
 he's
 bullish
 on.
 Is
 it
 reversing?


It
 was
 down
 five.
 Now
 it's
 down
 two.


Uh
 Lulu
 announces
 CEO
 succession
 plan.


Now
 we're
 green.


Now
 we're
 green.
 207%.
 Okay,
 that
 looks


like
 a
 way
 healthier
 candle
 than
 the
 red


one.
 I
 don't
 know if
 we
 can
 trust
 it


yet,
 but
 that
 does
 look
 way
 better
 than


the
 red
 candle.


Usually,
 if
 it's
 like
 a
 two
 or
 3%


candle,
 it's
 hard
 to
 trust
 it.
 If
 it's


like
 a
 six
 or
 7%
 candle,
 you
 can
 trust
 a


little
 bit
 more.
 This
 one
 was
 7%,
 now


it's
 three.


Now
 it's
 two.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 we
 can


trust
 it.
 193
 on
 Lulu.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 we


have
 the
 results.
 They
 beat
 by
 17%
 on


EPS.
 Wow.
 259
 versus
 222
 expected


revenue
 beat
 by
 3%
 2.56
 versus
 2.48


billion.


Again,
 these
 retailer
 names
 I
 really


don't
 have
 an
 explanation
 for
 what
 the


hell
 has
 happened
 over
 the
 past
 3


months,
 but
 whether
 it's
 Abberrombie
 or


Urban
 Outfitters
 now
 up
 8%.


People
 have
 the
 disposable
 income
 to


spend
 at
 these
 stores
 and
 and
 like
 that


just
 it
 didn't
 feel
 like
 that
 was
 the


case
 six
 months
 ago.


And
 now
 we
 are
 seeing
 these
 companies


just
 put
 up
 some
 a
 17%
 beat
 on
 EPS.


Those
 are
 tech
 company
 types
 of
 beats.


Lulu
 right
 there
 2011
 up
 almost
 8%
 hit


203.


We'll
 see
 if
 we
 can
 hold
 it
 here.
 But


that's
 green.
 Maybe
 it's
 just
 credit


card
 debt.
 Maybe
 it
 is
 just
 credit
 card


debt.
 Honestly,
 maybe
 that's
 the


explanation.
 But
 I
 mean
 it
 it's
 every


five
 below
 which
 is
 like
 a
 dollar
 store.


Best
 Buy,
 Burlington,
 like
 just
 so
 I
 did


not
 expect
 these
 many
 retailers
 to
 put


up
 these
 numbers,
 but
 they
 are.
 And
 it


seems
 like
 Lulu
 is
 the
 next
 one
 to
 do


it.
 It's
 not
 even
 the
 holiday
 season


because
 this
 ended
 in
 October
 or
 as
 uh


September
 this
 quarter
 for
 Q3.


So,
 you
 know,
 the
 holiday
 season,


October,
 November,
 December,
 maybe


that's
 going
 to
 be
 better
 than
 Q3,
 but


we
 can't
 attribute
 Q3
 numbers
 to
 to
 the


holiday
 months.
 Up
 7.5%.
 Let's
 go
 to


their
 website,
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 some


more
 coverage.
 I
 think
 we'll
 get


Broadcom
 in
 about
 two
 minutes.
 Does


anyone
 know
 if
 it's
 420
 or
 410?
 I'm


pretty
 sure
 it's
 410,


but
 it
 might
 be
 420.


So,
 we'll
 have


um
 10
 minutes
 to
 see.
 Sam
 Lou
 is


pumping.


>> Dude,
 I
 I
 want
 Amazon
 a
 pump.
 I
 want


Broadcom.
 I
 want
 it
 all
 to
 pump.
 Dude,
 I


apologize
 for
 being
 late,
 by
 the
 way.


>> No,
 no,
 you're
 good.
 You're
 good.
 Um


you're
 just
 in
 time
 for
 Broadcom.
 Lulu


buybacks
 189
 million
 in
 Q3.
 They
 now


have
 1.6
 billion
 remaining.
 2
 billion
 of


inventories.
 Cash
 is
 a
 billion.
 Q4


outlook
 looks
 better
 than
 expected.
 3.58


billion
 and
 EPS
 of
 476.
 Revenue
 for
 the


fiscal
 year
 10.96
 billion.
 I
 mean,
 it


looks
 like
 the
 consumer
 has
 some
 money


to
 spend.


And
 that's
 why
 you're
 seeing
 some
 of
 the


momentum
 in
 in
 Lulu.


Um,
 okay.
 Okay,
 we'll
 get
 more
 on
 the


Lulu
 numbers.
 Oh,
 wow.
 Their
 gross


margins
 as
 well.
 55.6
 versus
 54.4.


That'll
 get
 the
 street
 excited.
 And
 then


EPS
 again,
 that's
 17%
 B259
 versus
 222
 is


what
 the
 street
 is
 liking.
 Broadcom
 we


should
 be
 getting
 very
 soon.
 409
 up.2%.


Let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you
 own


Broadcom.
 I
 know
 this
 is
 the
 big
 one.


Bitcoin
 as
 well
 after
 hours.
 Look
 at


that
 candle.
 92,000.


It
 was
 stuck
 at
 pretty
 much
 90,000
 all


day.
 Pounders's
 up
 a
 little bit.
 Hood's


up
 a
 little bit.
 Iron's
 up
 a
 little
 bit.


Rocket
 Lab
 still
 moving
 after
 hours.


Google,
 which
 was
 down
 because
 of
 the


GPT
 model
 that
 came
 out
 today,
 that's
 up


14%.
 Even
 Nvidia
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of


love
 after
 hours
 along
 with
 the
 S&P.
 S&P


is
 now
 less
 than
 40
 cents
 away
 from


alltime
 highs
 after
 hours.
 And
 it
 looks


like
 Broadcom


will
 probably
 make
 the
 decision
 on
 if
 we


can
 break
 through.
 Yeah,
 the
 Lulu
 CEO
 is


retiring
 as
 well.
 I
 mean,
 maybe
 that's


why
 the
 street
 is
 happy.


Maybe
 the
 street
 did
 not
 like
 the
 CEO


and
 that
 could
 be
 another
 argument
 as


well.
 Uh
 Sam,
 any
 expectations
 for


Broadcom
 and
 do
 you
 have
 an
 earnings


play
 on
 this
 one?


>> I
 have
 an
 earnings
 play.
 I
 I
 have


degenerate
 calls
 on
 Broadcom.
 Well,


actually
 more
 like
 January
 spreads
 and
 I


also
 have
 Google
 calls
 as
 well
 because


you
 know
 of
 course
 the
 TVs.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


Okay.
 So,
 the
 degenerate
 calls,
 uh,
 you


have
 a
 strike
 on
 that.
 You
 have
 in
 the


money,
 out
 of
 the
 money.


>> So,
 well,
 the
 there,
 uh,
 the
 Google


calls
 are
 for
 this
 week.
 It
 was
 the,
 um,


215,
 sorry,
 315s.
 They're
 like
 a
 $150


each.
 So,
 like,
 you
 know,
 not
 really
 a


big
 deal.
 The
 the
 Broadcom
 or
 AVGO


spreads
 that
 I
 have
 for
 January
 16.
 I


have
 the
 I
 got
 to
 double
 check.
 I
 think


I
 have
 the
 400
 450s.
 So,
 obviously,


they're
 in
 the
 money
 right
 now.
 If
 they


tank,
 then
 they're
 gonna
 get
 hit
 pretty


hard.
 But
 these
 these
 degenerate
 calls


are
 like
 just
 very
 small
 size.
 Like
 not


even
 not
 even
 going
 to
 make
 a
 difference


if
 it
 goes
 down.
 But
 if
 it
 goes
 up,
 hey,


baby,
 let's
 go.


>> All
 right,
 we're
 going
 to
 see.
 Uh
 I


think
 guys,
 it
 might
 be
 4:15
 instead
 of


410.


>> Yeah,
 they're
 going
 to
 report
 late.
 They


always
 do
 that.


>> Okay,


>> Hawkan
 is
 putting
 together
 the
 uh


coupons
 for
 Burger
 King.
 He's
 doing
 that


stuff.
 Octane
 is
 one
 cheap
 guy.


>> All right,
 so
 we
 are
 going
 to
 see
 what


this
 ends
 up
 looking
 like
 and
 it's
 going


to
 take
 about
 five
 minutes
 and
 we'll
 get


some
 of
 the
 answers.
 Uh,
 in
 terms
 of


Lulu,
 so
 CEO
 said
 in
 the
 third
 quarter,


our
 teams
 remain
 focused
 on
 driving


improvements
 with
 our
 US
 business
 and


maintaining
 momentum
 in
 our


international
 regions.
 We
 are
 beginning


to
 make
 progress
 against
 our
 action
 plan


and
 continue
 to
 expect
 to
 see
 the
 impact


of
 this
 in
 2026.
 We
 are
 encouraged
 by


our
 early
 performance
 as
 we
 enter
 the


holiday
 season.
 Uh,
 revenue
 again
 two
 7%


up
 year-over-year
 2.6
 6
 billion
 buyback


program
 also
 has
 1.6
 6
 billion
 left,
 593


million
 in
 credit
 facility,
 a
 billion
 in


cash.


I
 mean,
 you
 don't
 have
 that
 much
 on
 the


press
 release
 outside
 of
 a
 EPS
 that's


aggressive,
 and
 the
 CEO
 stepping
 down.


So,
 it's
 not
 too
 crazy.


>> I
 I
 think
 the
 CEO
 stepping
 down
 is


probably
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 good
 idea
 there.
 um


they
 have
 very
 heavy
 China
 exposure
 and


I
 don't
 know if
 you
 saw
 yesterday
 but


China
 just
 put
 a
 massive
 stimulus


package
 in
 their
 economy
 so
 probably
 a


bit
 forward
 looking
 for
 their
 economy
 uh


especially
 for
 those
 topline
 numbers


that
 are
 coming
 in
 um
 but
 I
 mean
 my
 wife


she
 shops
 aloe
 or
 used
 to
 shop
 aloe


because
 now
 it's
 like
 a
 little
 bit


ridiculous
 but
 um
 you
 know
 I
 I
 think


it's
 a
 more
 commoditized
 industry
 also


Gap
 Athletica
 and
 you
 know
 you
 also
 have


Um,
 Nike.
 I
 don't
 know.
 Hey,
 maybe


Michael
 Bur.
 I
 think
 Michael
 Bur's
 long


this,
 right?


>> Yes,
 he
 is.
 He
 is.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 he's
 also
 short
 Palunteer


Nvidia,
 so
 I
 don't
 know how
 well
 that's


going
 to
 go.
 But
 dude,
 Carisdale
 Capital


nailed
 that
 short,
 which
 is
 very


annoying
 on
 BMR.


Those
 guys.


>> I
 remember
 when
 they
 did
 the
 spaces
 the


day
 they
 were
 they
 were
 so
 cocky
 about


it,
 dude.
 They're
 like,
 "Yeah,
 this


shit's
 going
 down."
 Everyone
 was
 like,


>> I
 just
 didn't
 want
 them
 to
 win,
 but
 they


won.
 I
 don't
 know if
 they
 covered


though.


>> I
 agree.
 Uh
 S&P
 by
 the
 way
 guys,
 alltime


high
 is
 after
 hours.
 I
 know
 it's
 after


hours,
 but
 we
 are
 20
 cents
 away
 from


seeing
 690
 on
 the


>> Yeah,
 actually
 S&P
 or
 the
 SP
 500,
 the


actual
 index
 closed
 at
 an
 alltime
 high


today.
 So
 that's
 really
 that's
 very


bullish
 to
 see.
 Like
 when
 you
 see
 like


those
 those
 like
 massive
 drops
 get


bought
 up
 like
 that,
 that
 is
 such
 a


bullish
 setup
 cuz
 you
 have
 everyone
 who


is
 positioned
 for
 it
 to
 go
 lower
 just


covering
 all
 their
 shorts.


So
 I
 don't
 know.
 I'm
 pretty
 bullish


heading
 toward
 the
 end
 of the
 year
 to
 be


honest.
 I
 want
 to
 see
 Bitcoin
 come
 back


though.


>> Bitcoin
 right
 there
 92.5.
 Chris
 will
 be


on
 in
 about
 20
 minutes
 and
 we
 will
 uh


get
 into
 a
 bunch
 of
 different
 macro


topics.
 We
 will
 not
 be
 listening
 to
 the


broad
 broadcast
 call.
 If
 anyone
 wants
 to


listen
 to
 it,
 uh,
 you
 can
 go
 to
 their


website,
 but
 we
 will
 be
 analyzing
 and


breaking
 their
 numbers.
 And
 I
 mean,
 Sam,


you
 think
 they
 pump?
 Cuz
 I'm
 thinking


they
 pump,
 even
 though
 I
 know
 their


multiple
 is
 aggressive.


>> I
 think
 they
 pump.
 Um,
 there
 was
 a


massive
 sell
 this
 morning.
 I
 think
 it


was
 down
 like
 four
 or
 five%
 or
 something


this
 morning
 and
 then
 it
 got
 bought
 up.


And
 I
 don't
 know,
 man.
 Even
 though
 I


don't
 own
 Google,
 I
 do
 believe
 that


Google
 has
 the
 best
 AI
 model
 that's
 out


there
 right
 now.
 according
 to
 poly


markets,
 according
 to
 a
 lot
 of


benchmarks
 that
 I
 see.
 And
 then
 you
 see


Sam
 Alman
 come
 over
 here
 with
 a
 code
 red


saying
 that
 he
 has
 the
 best
 model
 out


there,
 post
 some
 crazy
 benchmarks
 I've


never
 even
 seen
 in
 my
 entire
 life.


And
 then
 Time
 magazine
 doesn't
 even
 have


Sun
 Bashai
 on
 there.
 Like
 come
 on.
 Like


I
 don't
 know,
 man.
 I
 feel
 like
 the


sentiment
 of
 Google
 is
 still
 pretty
 bad.


I
 think
 Google's
 come
 back
 with
 the


TPUs.
 I
 think
 Broadcom
 is
 a
 proxy
 for


that
 play
 as
 well.


>> Yeah,
 Broadcom
 is
 the
 absolute
 biggest


proxy.
 Also,
 I
 I'm
 forgetting
 and
 Sam
 is


is
 uh
 is
 in
 Amcor
 as
 well,
 but
 if


Broadcom
 pumps,
 Amcor
 could
 pump
 with


it.
 They
 are
 one
 of
 their
 best


suppliers.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 just
 seeing


Rivian
 with
 a
 new
 AI
 chip.
 We
 don't
 know


who's
 designing
 those
 chips.
 I
 was
 like


looking
 back
 in
 some
 research
 there.
 And


it
 looks
 like
 Sam,
 they
 were
 partnered


with
 Samsung
 for
 designing
 some
 of
 their


chips
 lately.
 So,
 maybe
 it
 is
 Samsung.


Um
 but
 I
 am
 lo.


We're
 getting
 a
 move.
 Let's
 go.


She's
 moving
 2.9.


Let's
 see.
 We
 need
 above
 4%
 for
 me
 to
 be


convinced
 this
 candle
 has
 some
 juice
 in


it.
 3.3.
 It
 touched
 421
 for
 a
 second.


This
 is
 where
 it
 could
 reverse
 easily
 if


it
 doesn't
 hold
 up.
 Uh,
 it's
 not
 holding


two.
 Now
 it's
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 to


three.
 416


on
 Broadcom.


Um,


I'll
 get
 the
 numbers
 in
 a
 second.
 417.


This
 one's
 being
 a
 little
 stuck,
 but


let's
 see


if
 something
 their
 numbers
 can
 really


take
 off.
 Okay,
 we
 got
 the
 numbers.
 EPS


195
 versus
 187.
 That's
 a
 beat.
 Revenue


18.02
 versus
 17.7.
 That
 is
 a
 beat.


Double
 beat.
 Good.
 Not
 a
 massive
 massive


beat,
 but
 at
 the
 price
 they
 are
 trading


at
 and
 the
 multiple
 they're
 trading
 at,


they
 definitely
 needed
 a
 double
 beat
 and


they
 got
 one.
 Now
 you
 got a
 4%
 candle.


It
 makes
 me
 a
 lot
 more
 bullish
 to
 see
 if


this
 can
 hold.


Dude,
 Hawk
 Tan
 is
 that
 cheap
 Asian
 uncle


that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have.
 He's
 cutting


those
 coupons.
 He's
 cutting
 corners.


He's
 the
 guy
 who's
 making
 sure
 that


everyone
 eats
 at
 home,
 brings
 food
 to


the
 mall,
 brings
 soda
 to
 the
 mall
 and


everything.
 Hawk
 Tan
 is
 coming
 around


the
 corner.
 Did
 you
 look
 at
 a
 picture
 of


the
 HQ
 for
 Broadcom?
 It
 [laughter]
 looks


like
 just
 a
 rundown
 building
 of
 some


sort.
 Yeah.
 But
 amazing
 company
 though.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 definitely
 not
 looking
 like


the
 Nvidia
 building.
 There
 you
 go.
 4%


beat.
 EPS
 up
 37%
 year-over-year.
 Revenue


is
 up
 28%
 year-over-year.
 We'll
 get


deeper
 into
 the
 numbers,
 but
 I
 mean
 this


is
 good.
 You
 needed
 two
 big
 beats.
 Their


AI
 revenue
 is
 likely
 going
 to
 be
 the
 one


that's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 highlight
 of


today's
 uh
 earnings
 as
 they'll
 discuss


it.
 I
 think
 it's
 growing
 at
 80%


year-over-year.


>> Dude,
 look
 at
 the
 cues
 right
 now,


>> dude.
 every
 it
 it it
 kind
 of
 doesn't


feel
 like
 alltime
 highs
 across
 the


board,
 but
 it
 is.
 Look
 at
 Yeah,
 the
 Q's


up
 almost
 half
 a
 percent.


S&P
 definitively
 above
 690,
 folks.


690.5.


This
 is
 reminding
 me
 of
 last
 night
 when


everything
 was
 dumping
 at
 10
 p.m.
 and
 no


one
 had
 an
 explanation
 and
 now
 after


hours
 everything's
 pumping.
 Uh
 Brock,


>> I
 couldn't
 sleep.


>> Yeah,
 it
 was
 hard,
 especially
 because


there
 was
 no
 reason
 for
 it.
 Lulu's
 up


7.5.
 Amcor
 4730.
 that's
 at
 52-
 week


highs.
 Q's
 are
 running
 and
 Broadcom
 is


helping
 everything
 out.
 Oracle
 is
 flat


after
 hours.
 So
 unlike
 Oracle,
 Broadcom


is
 contributing
 decisively
 to
 a
 lot.


Even
 Nvidia
 up
 half
 a
 percent
 after


hours
 based
 on
 this
 Broadcom
 earnings.


3.3%
 even
 Bitcoin.
 Wow.
 It's
 almost
 like


a
 delayed
 Fed
 JPAL
 pivot
 reaction
 mixed


with
 Broadcom,


which
 is
 getting
 the
 street
 excited.
 All


right,
 so
 let's
 go
 to
 their
 website.


Let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 some
 deeper


numbers
 on
 Broadcom


and
 see


the
 earnings.
 All
 right,
 here
 we
 go.


Let's
 see.
 Let's
 see.
 Let's
 see.
 Let's


see
 what
 we
 got.
 Broadcom
 fourth
 quarter


revenue
 18
 billion
 for
 the
 fourth


quarter,
 up
 28%
 year-over-year.


Um
 CEO
 says
 in
 our
 Q4
 record
 revenue


grew
 28%
 year-over-year.
 We
 see
 the


momentum
 continuing
 in
 Q1
 and
 expect
 AI


semiconductor
 revenue
 to
 double


year-over-year
 to
 8.2
 billion.
 Wow.


Guiding
 for
 100%
 growth
 on
 AI
 revenue


driven
 by
 custom
 AI
 accelerators
 and


Ethernet
 AI
 switches.
 We
 forecast
 Q1


2026
 total
 revenue
 of
 19.1
 billion
 with


adjusted
 IBIDA
 of
 67%.


Um


cash
 is
 16
 billion.
 quarterly
 stock


dividend
 increased
 by
 10%.


I
 forgot
 they
 pay
 a
 dividend.
 Um


increase
 of
 their
 guidance
 to
 19.1


billion.
 That's
 up
 28%
 year-over-year.


So
 continuing
 that
 kind
 of
 30%
 growth


rate.
 And
 then
 adjusted
 EBID
 up
 16%
 of


re
 or
 67%
 of
 revenue
 which
 again
 is
 not


too
 bad.
 Gap
 diluted
 EPS
 of
 174.


I
 mean
 so
 far
 you're
 seeing
 a
 beat
 on


the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom
 and
 an
 increase


in
 the
 AI
 portion
 of
 their
 guidance.


100%
 look
 at
 that
 right
 there
 is
 what


they're
 guiding
 for
 on
 the
 AI
 part
 of


the
 business.
 Costco
 also
 has
 earnings


as
 well.
 Go
 ahead,
 S.


>> No,
 go
 ahead
 with
 Costco.
 Go
 ahead.
 I


was
 going
 to
 comment
 on
 AVGO.


>> Okay.
 Well,
 let
 me
 just
 give
 the
 numbers


real
 quick
 for
 Costco.
 Costco
 right


here,
 they
 beat
 by
 5%
 on
 EPS,
 450
 versus


427
 and
 67.3
 versus
 67.1
 for
 revenues.


Costco
 after
 hours
 is
 down
 1%.


Go
 ahead
 Sam
 on
 Broadcom.
 No,
 I
 was


gonna
 say
 Broadcom
 this
 is
 uh
 this
 is
 a


very
 interesting
 play
 for
 the
 market


because
 not
 only
 do
 they
 have
 the
 ASIC


or
 the
 um
 applied
 sorry
 application


specific
 integrated
 circuits
 TPUs


um
 not
 specifically
 with
 the
 training


processors
 but
 they
 are
 partnering
 with


ARM
 technology
 I
 believe
 or
 ARM
 I
 think


they
 also
 have
 the
 VMware
 purchase
 that


they
 had
 back
 four
 years
 ago
 which
 is


also
 increasing
 the
 revenue
 in
 terms
 of


the
 semi
 sorry
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 software


industry
 as
 well.
 So
 it's
 kind
 of
 like


you
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 that
 hyperscaler


space,
 maybe
 more
 in
 the
 private
 side,


but
 you
 also
 get
 the
 chip
 fabrication


space
 as
 well,


>> right?


>> But
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 this
 is
 all


just
 bullish
 for
 Amcore,
 man.
 Like
 this


is
 bullish
 for
 Amcore.
 anything
 to
 do


with
 uh
 US-based
 chip
 packaging
 or


anything
 to
 do
 with
 uh
 building


photoronics
 PA
 lab.
 I
 don't know
 if


you're
 in
 that
 one.
 Um
 that
 also
 has
 to


do
 with
 basically
 being
 one
 of
 the
 only


US-based


um
 photo
 masking
 companies
 for
 basically


putting
 all
 the
 uh
 circuits
 on
 those


chips
 on
 their
 own.
 And
 then
 I'm
 also


bullish
 and
 also
 long
 on
 semiconductor


which
 is
 more
 of
 the
 power
 chips
 for
 the


EVs
 as
 well
 and
 the
 AI
 servers.
 So,
 I


don't
 know,
 man.
 This
 is
 very
 bullish


for
 US
 stocks
 or
 for
 US-based
 companies,


which
 is
 the
 reason
 why
 you're
 seeing


massive
 bids
 on
 them
 left
 and
 right.


Broadcom
 is
 like
 2%
 up.
 I
 wanted
 to
 come


back
 here,
 man.
 It's
 got
 to
 come
 back.


>> All
 right,
 let's
 get
 some
 more
 coverage


on
 Broadcom.


>> The
 EPS
 earnings
 per
 share
 $1.95
 on


revenues
 of
 18.02
 billion,
 higher
 than


the
 street
 anticipated.
 Same
 thing
 for


Q1
 revenue
 guidance
 coming
 in
 slightly


higher,
 19.1
 billion.
 The
 company
 is


attributing
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 strength


specifically
 to
 AI
 semiconductor


revenue.
 They're
 saying
 it's
 increasing


74%
 year-over-year.
 But
 one
 really


important
 metric
 is
 AI
 revenue.


Specifically,
 AI
 revenue,
 they
 guided


for
 6.2
 billion
 for
 the
 quarter.
 They


actually
 hit
 8.2.
 So
 much
 higher
 than


what
 they
 promised
 they
 would
 hit
 last


quarter.
 And
 this
 is
 important
 too


because
 it
 is
 tied
 to
 Hawk
 10,
 the
 CEO.


His
 expensive
 pay
 package
 is
 tied
 to


various
 tiers
 of
 selling
 AI
 revenue.
 So


I
 think
 that's
 adding
 to
 the
 the
 stock


increase
 of
 about
 3%.
 Semiconductor


revenue
 higher
 11
 billion.


Infrastructure
 revenue
 higher
 $6.9


billion.
 So
 across
 the
 board
 uh
 so
 far


it's
 a
 beat
 versus
 estimates
 and
 it


seems
 to
 be
 a
 beat
 off
 of
 uh
 some
 buy


side
 expectations
 too.
 So
 that's


probably
 driving
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 that


uptick
 in
 the
 stock
 right
 now
 guys.


>> Uh
 Christina
 thank
 you
 great
 father
 for


the
 conversation.
 Okay.
 Now,
 so


Stephanie,
 now
 that
 we
 know
 this,
 is
 the


good
 news
 here
 from
 Broadcom
 mainly
 good


for
 Broadcom
 or
 how
 much
 is
 it
 good
 for


the
 over
 a
 overall
 AI
 trade


counterbalancing
 some
 of
 the
 questions


out
 of
 Oracle?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 um
 when
 you
 think
 about


Broadcom
 like
 where
 their
 focus
 has
 been


in
 my
 mind
 like
 that
 actually
 is
 pushes


the
 positive
 part
 of
 the
 narrative
 which


has
 been
 that
 there's
 a
 diversification


of
 leaders.
 It's
 no
 longer
 just
 an


Nvidia
 play
 and
 I
 think
 you
 know
 Google


has
 been
 a
 place
 that
 we
 have
 played


that
 and
 you've
 seen
 that
 do
 really


well.
 Um
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 going
 to


start
 to
 broaden.
 So
 our
 view
 is
 that
 AI


starts
 to
 creep
 into
 the
 broader


economy.
 People
 start
 to
 use
 it
 more
 and


it's
 no
 longer
 about
 like
 the
 hardware


or
 the
 models.
 It's
 more
 about
 like
 the


actual
 improvement
 in
 efficiency.
 And


that's
 where
 I
 think
 like
 Broadcom
 can


be
 a
 good
 player
 because
 it
 creates
 some


competition
 in
 the
 chip
 space.
 Um,
 but


also
 I
 think
 it
 it
 shows
 that
 I
 I
 just


think
 it's
 turning
 to
 a
 new
 phase
 and


that's
 why,
 for example,
 we
 added
 to


Microsoft
 recently
 because
 we
 think


that's
 actually
 going
 to
 benefit
 a


little
 bit
 more
 now.
 Interesting.
 All


right,
 Stephanie
 Guild,
 thank
 you.
 So,


rotation
 across
 the
 market
 and
 rotation


within
 the


>> All
 right,
 so
 the
 street
 likes
 it.
 I


mean,


it's
 not
 a
 massive
 explosive
 quarter.


Stocks
 up
 2%
 which
 is
 nothing
 crazy.
 It


was
 up
 almost
 five.
 Um


>> I
 think
 they're
 a$
 two
 trillion
 dollar


company
 now,
 right?


>> Basically,
 yeah,
 they
 were
 at
 1.92.
 So


if
 they're
 not
 at
 two
 trillion,
 they're


very
 close.


>> Um


uh


>> I
 know
 that
 that's
 crazy.
 Dove
 Bear
 said


Brocom
 or
 AVGO
 was
 169
 in
 April.
 That's


insane.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 I
 mean
 this
 I
 mean
 just
 a


massive
 massive
 move.
 Obviously
 massive


move
 from
 the
 bottom.
 And
 you
 know
 the


expectations
 going
 into
 this
 earnings
 I


think
 were
 high
 but
 they
 couldn't
 be


that
 high
 because
 the
 stock
 was
 up
 75%.


So
 may
 maybe
 the
 stock
 price


expectations
 irrationally
 were
 high
 but


in
 terms
 of
 the
 actual
 doubling
 of
 AI


revenue
 which
 the
 street
 thought
 I
 think


would
 only
 go
 by
 80%.
 So
 you
 had
 a
 20%


beat
 right
 there
 that's
 a
 big
 deal
 and


that's
 what's
 at
 least
 going
 to
 keep


this
 thing
 holding
 its
 multiply.
 I
 think


it's
 trading
 at
 correct
 correct
 me
 if


I'm
 wrong
 guys
 100
 times
 forward


earnings
 on
 on
 their
 PE
 100
 times


forward
 gap
 earn.
 I
 mean
 like


>> well
 28%
 growth
 for
 a
 $2
 trillion


company
 uh
 you
 have
 to
 kind
 of
 command


that
 valuation
 especially
 when
 earnings


growth
 is
 just
 catapulting.
 So


>> but
 100
 times


I


>> mean
 we
 got
 $3
 trillion
 companies
 that


are
 barely
 trading
 at
 30
 times.


>> Yeah.
 But
 um
 hold
 on
 let
 me
 let
 me
 take


a
 look
 here.
 How
 what's
 the
 earnings


growth?


>> Their
 margins
 can't
 be
 better
 than
 Meta.


I
 would
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 they


would.
 I
 mean
 at
 the
 end of
 the
 day
 it's


chips,
 right?


Like
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 saying
 that
 it's


overvalued
 or
 something.
 I'm
 just
 saying


like
 for
 this
 to
 get
 even
 higher
 than
 a


70%
 move
 this
 year.
 I
 mean
 it's
 just


asking
 for
 a
 lot
 at
 these
 levels


which
 is
 why
 I
 think
 we're
 not
 seeing
 a


massive
 move
 after
 hours
 even
 though


it's
 a
 good
 earnings
 up
 2.5%.


2.5%
 uh
 two
 trillion
 dollar
 company
 is


still
 a
 big
 move.
 Um
 would
 like
 to
 see


it
 higher.
 Google
 is
 almost
 at
 314
 after


hours
 which
 is
 good
 to
 see.
 Yesterday


they
 they
 actually


They
 were
 just
 trading
 at
 321
 today.


It's
 insane.
 Wow.


>> Yeah.
 Google,
 all
 these
 guys
 getting
 a


bid,


>> man.


>> Look
 at
 Amcor,
 bro.
 It's
 about
 to
 hit
 48


after
 hours.


>> Dude,
 this
 was
 12%
 of
 my
 portfolio
 when


it
 was
 like
 $32


with
 calls.


>> I
 mean,
 it
 the
 calls
 were
 the
 right.
 I
 I


only
 bought
 stock,
 but
 calls
 obviously


worked
 out
 much
 better.


>> It's
 been
 crazy.
 It's
 been
 crazy.


>> So,
 are
 you
 trimming
 Amcore
 here
 or
 No,


>> no.
 No,
 I
 actually
 added
 the
 Amcore
 the


other
 day.
 [laughter]


>> You
 added
 more
 yesterday?
 Okay.


>> Yeah,
 I
 added
 more
 to
 Amcore
 because
 I


took
 off
 a
 position
 from
 my
 portfolio.


It
 just
 it
 was
 not
 performing.
 Um,


>> do
 you
 do
 you
 think
 the
 custom
 chip


narrative
 is
 something
 that
 can
 get
 this


stock
 closer
 to
 like
 the
 430s,
 440s?
 So


if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 estimates
 from
 Wall


Street
 analysts,
 they
 do
 expect
 Nvidia


to
 lose
 share.
 I
 think
 Nvidia
 is


expected
 to
 have
 like
 about
 70
 73%
 of


the
 market
 share
 of
 GPUs
 by
 2030.
 And


then
 you
 have
 Broadcom,
 AMD,
 and
 all


these
 other
 companies
 coming
 to
 the


industry.
 Well,
 not
 coming
 to
 the


industry,
 but
 getting
 more
 market
 share


in
 the
 industry,
 which
 think
 of
 a


multi-t
 trillion
 dollar
 TAM.
 You
 don't


need
 a
 lot
 in
 order
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 the


cake.
 I
 mean,
 look
 at
 that,
 right?
 If


you're
 if
 they're
 at
 $6.9
 billion,


sorry,
 if
 they're
 at
 11.1
 billion,
 just


billion
 dollars
 for
 the
 quarter
 for
 a


multi-trillion
 dollar
 TAM
 industry,
 you


don't
 need
 a
 lot
 to
 grow
 your
 revenue


massively,
 right?
 So,
 I
 I
 I
 think
 Nvidia


is
 actually
 probably
 going
 to
 go
 up
 from


here
 because
 they're
 like
 the
 center
 of


AI
 when
 you
 really
 think
 about
 it.
 But,


it
 doesn't
 take
 a
 lot
 of
 market
 share


for
 these
 other
 companies
 to
 lose.
 So


maybe
 Nvidia
 lose
 like
 5%
 market
 share


which
 I've
 read
 some
 analyst
 reports


it's
 included
 in
 the
 modeling
 for
 them


like
 they
 expect
 Nvidia
 to
 lose
 market


share
 but
 the
 thing
 is
 Nvidia
 isn't
 just


data
 center
 GPUs
 they're
 also
 expanding


margins
 as
 well
 they're
 also
 have
 uh
 the


gaming
 unit
 which
 is
 supposed
 to
 be


coming
 back
 if
 the
 consumer
 comes
 back


they
 also
 have
 the
 automotive
 unit
 and


then
 on
 top
 of
 that
 they
 also
 have
 um


what
 is
 that
 called
 the
 uh
 NVLink
 as


well
 so
 you
 could
 have
 your
 entire


ecosystem
 but
 all
 these
 different
 type


of
 ASIC
 chips
 all
 connected
 in
 the


Nvidia
 ecosystem.
 Like
 I
 I
 don't
 see


this
 market
 continuing
 to
 go
 higher


without
 Nvidia.
 It's
 very
 hard
 to
 see


that
 happening.


>> Do
 you
 think
 Broadcom
 is
 bearish
 for


Nvidia
 or
 No,


>> no,
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 is.
 I
 think
 it's


act
 Well,
 clearly
 it's
 bullish
 for


Nvidia.
 Nvidia
 is
 up
 uh
 25
 basis
 points


after
 hours
 and
 Broadcom
 is
 up
 3.5%.


The
 market
 obviously
 likes
 it.
 It's


bullish.


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 So
 you
 think
 the
 customer
 is


only
 expanding
 the
 pie,
 but
 you
 don't


think
 it's
 necessarily
 taking
 away


market
 share.


>> So
 broadcom
 isn't
 a
 hyperscaler,
 right?


I
 mean,
 they
 have
 their
 own
 private
 data


center
 unit
 that
 they
 purchased
 from


VMware,
 but
 they're
 not
 a
 hyperscaler,


right?
 They
 they
 they
 design
 chips
 for


other
 companies
 and
 specifically
 the


TPUs.
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 ARM.
 Don't
 quote
 me


that
 I
 think
 it's
 ARM.
 And


really
 like
 the
 expansion
 of
 data


centers
 in
 that
 case
 is
 just
 going
 to
 be


wholly
 beneficial
 for
 Broadcom.
 Like
 it


doesn't
 matter
 if
 Nvidia
 is
 up
 or
 down.


Like
 what
 matters
 is
 that
 the
 demand
 is


still
 there
 and
 the
 demand
 is
 clearly


there
 from
 every
 single
 hypers
 scale
 in


the
 entire
 world
 including
 Alibaba,


right?
 I'm
 not
 saying
 that
 Alibaba
 is


going to
 start
 buying
 TPUs,
 but
 like


this
 is
 just
 bullish
 for
 the
 whole


sector.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 fair


point
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 also
 why
 look


at
 Meta
 making
 a
 move
 after
 hours.


Google
 making
 a
 move.
 Broadcom
 now


actually
 kind
 of
 holding
 on
 to
 that
 3%


move.
 If
 that
 can
 get
 closer
 to
 5%
 if


Hawkan
 uh
 says
 some
 good
 stuff
 on
 the


call
 then
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 really


exciting
 market
 open
 tomorrow.
 If
 this


can
 hold
 on
 to
 momentum
 S&P
 still
 moving


after
 hours.
 DraftKings
 moving
 up.


Bitcoin
 just
 below
 93.
 It's
 almost
 like


a
 pretty
 strong
 reversal
 from


yesterday's
 10
 p.m.
 11
 p.m.
 dump.
 Even


hoodie
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 after
 hours.


Pounder
 up
 as
 well.
 Silver
 continuing
 to


move.
 Seen
 the
 entire
 market
 say


Broadcom
 is
 giving
 us
 enough
 juice.


Nebius
 moving.
 IN
 moving.
 All
 the
 data


center
 plays
 moving.


>> Oh,
 the
 move
 on
 Nebius
 is
 just


beautiful.
 Just
 beautiful.
 Nebas
 went


green
 on
 the
 day.
 They
 closed
 green


today.
 They're
 up
 32
 basis
 points
 after


hours.
 It's
 just
 a
 beautiful
 move
 for


Nebius
 to
 be
 green
 today
 after
 this


crazy
 selloff
 in
 the
 morning.


>> I
 agree.
 I
 agree.
 Let's
 get
 some
 updates


on
 Costco
 and
 then
 we'll
 talk
 a
 little


bit
 more
 about
 about
 Nebius.


>> $450.


That
 is
 better
 than
 expectations
 for


$427.
 Revenues
 also
 stronger
 than


expected.
 This
 is
 total
 revenue
 so


inclusive
 of
 membership
 fees
 67307


billion.
 The
 street
 was
 looking
 for


67.137


billion.
 Comp
 sales,
 we
 know
 we
 still


get
 these
 from
 Costco
 regularly,
 but


total
 for
 the
 quarter
 up
 6.4%.


Digitally
 enabled
 sales
 up
 20.5%.
 The


company
 did
 recently
 change
 how
 they're


reporting
 that
 number.
 So,
 it's
 going
 to


be
 a
 little
 different
 comparison
 if
 you


want
 to
 look
 back
 to
 previous
 quarters,


but
 just
 know
 now
 it
 is
 digitally


enabled
 sales
 increased
 by
 20.5%
 and
 the


membership
 fees
 that
 were
 inclusive
 in


that
 total
 number
 did
 grow
 14%


year-over-year.
 Right
 now,
 shares
 down


just
 a
 little
 bit
 for
 Costco.
 Back
 over


to
 you.


>> All
 right,
 Courtney
 Reagan,
 thank
 you.


Uh,
 meantime,
 the
 S&P
 500
 financials


sector.


>> I
 mean,
 we're
 getting
 a
 move
 after


hours,
 folks,
 including
 Biddycoin.
 Look


at
 that
 candle.


This
 was
 at
 91.7


10
 minutes
 ago.
 93.4.
 Uh,
 okay.
 Nebia,


Sam,
 are
 you
 still
 buying
 here
 or
 how


are
 you
 thinking
 of
 Nebas
 in
 the
 data


center
 place?


>> Oh,
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 I'm
 still
 long.
 Still


long
 as
 hell,
 Nebius.
 It's
 It
 used
 to
 be


13%
 of
 my
 my
 portfolio
 when
 it
 was
 like


140
 bucks.
 Now
 it's
 down
 to
 like
 eight


or
 9%.
 I'm
 still
 holding.
 I
 had
 it
 a


little
 bit
 recently,
 but
 like
 I
 I
 didn't


it
 really
 wasn't
 a
 lot,
 but
 I'm
 still


bullish.
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 still
 think
 that
 of


all
 the
 data
 center
 plays,
 this
 is
 the


best
 one.
 Um
 I
 I
 still
 have
 that


position
 I
 ran
 which
 is
 clearly
 not


doing
 well
 at
 all.
 But
 I
 mean
 the
 rest


of the
 port
 is
 going
 up.
 So
 it's
 like


all
 right,
 well
 you
 got
 this
 small


position
 that's
 going
 down.
 It's
 all


good.
 Do
 you
 think
 the
 data
 center


selloff
 via
 whatever
 narrative
 is
 going


on,
 whether
 it's
 Oracle
 increased
 debt


financing,
 do
 you
 think
 that's
 actually


a
 real
 narrative
 to
 care
 about
 or
 is


that
 just
 part
 of
 holding
 these
 data


center?


>> No,
 it's
 it's
 nothing
 to
 care
 about.
 I


mean,
 Oracle
 still
 producing
 Steve.


Okay,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 take
 the
 words


from
 Steve's
 mouth
 because
 I
 didn't


really
 dig
 too
 much
 into
 Oracle
 and
 Jose


probably
 did
 as
 well,
 but
 I
 mean
 Oracle


is
 almost
 I
 think
 it
 not
 tripling,
 but


like
 they're
 adding
 $2
 billion
 of
 cash


flow
 to
 its
 operations
 in
 the
 last
 year.


They're
 they're
 not
 just
 a
 private
 data


center
 business
 like
 they
 also
 have


peopleoft.
 They
 also
 have
 a
 lot
 of


software
 including
 in
 included
 in
 in


their
 their
 horizontal
 list
 of
 products.


Like
 this
 company's
 not
 going
 anywhere


and
 the
 company's
 basically
 40%
 down


from
 its
 all-time
 highs.
 Um,
 by
 the
 way


guys,
 my
 grandpa
 actually
 is
 not
 alive


anymore.
 It
 was
 kind
 of
 a
 joke.
 I
 didn't


really
 tell
 my
 grand
 because
 I
 mean
 he's


passed
 away
 but
 like
 I
 didn't
 tell


anyone
 to
 buy
 Oracle
 at
 330.
 But
 the


thing
 is
 is
 that
 how
 this
 company
 has


gotten
 so
 ridiculously
 sold
 to
 a
 certain


point
 that
 people
 actually
 forget
 what


brought
 Oracle
 to
 its
 to
 its
 point
 where


it
 is
 today
 besides
 just
 this
 private


data
 center
 remote.
 Okay.
 Is
 the
 500


plus
 billion
 dollar
 backlog
 actually


going
 to
 come
 to
 fruition?
 I
 don't
 know.


We'll
 see.
 They
 just
 released
 chat
 GPT


or
 they
 just
 they
 just
 released
 GPT
 5.2


which
 they
 need
 to
 compute,
 right?
 So


does
 Oracle
 care
 if
 maybe
 there's
 not


that
 much
 demand
 for
 it?
 I
 I
 think
 it's


still
 going
 to
 be
 a
 good
 great
 company


and
 I
 think
 that
 today
 it's
 still
 of


good
 value,
 but
 it's
 just
 not
 where
 I


want
 to
 put
 my
 money
 personally.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 fair
 point
 and


I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 exciting


opportunities
 in
 the
 AI
 space,
 but
 that


also
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 Oracle
 has
 to


collapse.
 So,
 I
 agree
 with
 the
 sell
 off


today
 on
 that.


>> It's
 it's
 a
 little
 ridiculous
 that
 the


collapse
 has
 gotten
 pretty
 insane.


Obviously,
 it's
 above
 $200
 per
 share


right
 now
 after
 hours
 and
 probably


closed
 it
 above
 $200.
 I
 think
 getting


back
 down,
 closing
 that
 gap
 that


everyone
 was
 looking
 at
 was
 a
 technical


bounce
 from
 there.
 I
 think
 the
 sell-off


this
 morning
 was
 just
 a
 little
 bit


overdone
 in
 my
 opinion.
 I
 mean,
 I
 we


needed
 it
 because
 how
 if
 we
 were


propelling
 to
 all-time
 highs
 yesterday,


I
 don't
 know
 how
 much
 momentum
 would


continue
 if
 everyone
 was
 so
 bullish
 at


the
 end
 of the
 day.
 But
 the
 fact
 that


you
 scared
 the
 pants
 out
 of
 everyone


last
 night
 and
 this
 morning,
 including


myself,


people
 definitely
 shorted
 the
 market
 at


the
 bottom.
 And
 what
 has
 happened?


People
 just
 rush
 back
 in.
 The
 same
 thing


we
 see
 all
 the
 time.
 Like
 I
 feel
 like
 at


the
 end
 of the
 day,
 like
 valuations


matter,
 but
 not
 so
 much
 in
 the
 short
 and


medium
 term.
 In
 the
 short
 and
 medium


term,
 it
 just
 matters
 the
 positioning


and
 the
 sentiment
 of
 the
 market.
 And
 I


personally
 don't
 think
 the
 sentiment
 is


that
 great.
 Otherwise,
 you
 wouldn't
 have


had
 a
 massive
 rally
 toward
 green
 from


like
 1.2%
 down
 in
 the
 S&P
 500
 making
 new


all-time
 highs
 today.
 Like
 that
 wouldn't


have
 happened
 if
 sentiment
 was
 so


bullish


at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 day.


>> No,
 I
 agree.
 It's
 a
 very
 very
 fair
 point


and
 obviously
 we're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 that


sentiment
 rotation
 happening
 throughout


the
 entirety
 of
 the
 day
 and
 throughout


the
 entirety
 of
 the
 market.
 All right


folks,
 so
 that
 is
 Broadcom
 Lulu
 and


Costco.
 We
 are
 not
 going
 to
 be
 listening


to
 the
 Broadcom
 call.
 If
 you
 want
 to,


you
 can
 go
 on
 their
 website.
 We're
 going


to
 get
 into
 Macro
 Thursday
 and
 discuss
 a


variety
 of
 other
 macro
 topics
 myself,


Sam,
 and
 our
 friend
 Christopher
 Patel.


We
 haven't
 been
 able
 to
 do
 macro


Thursday
 for
 the
 past
 two
 weeks
 because


of
 a
 lot
 of
 earnings,
 but
 uh
 Chris,
 who


is
 a
 mutual
 friend
 of
 both
 of
 us,
 has


initiated
 a
 new
 position
 in
 his


portfolio.
 I
 didn't
 think
 I
 would
 see


the
 day,
 but
 it
 is
 official,
 ladies
 and


gentlemen.
 The
 man
 himself
 to
 explain


why
 he
 is
 now
 bullish


invidia.


>> It's
 probably
 the
 top.
 That's
 exactly


what
 it
 is.


>> That's
 what
 I
 said.
 That's
 what I
 said


yesterday.
 It's
 like
 Chris's


video.
 This
 is
 the
 top
 now.
 This
 is
 the


top.
 This
 This
 is
 like
 Bonnie
 Blue


converting
 to
 like
 uh
 what
 is
 it
 called?


Like
 becoming
 like
 Orthodox
 religious


person,
 you
 know,
 and
 just
 like
 what


happened,
 Bonnie?
 Like
 what
 happened?


You're
 not
 doing
 the
 thousand
 person


gang
 bangs
 anymore.
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 I


was
 trying
 to
 mess
 with
 Ahmed
 this


morning
 so
 bad
 and
 he
 was
 like
 trying
 to


keep
 his
 composure.
 It
 was
 it
 was
 fun


watching
 him
 squirm
 and
 then
 the
 entire


chat
 was
 like
 like
 coming
 along
 with
 it.


So


>> dude,
 I'm
 trying
 to
 talk
 about
 Oracle's


remaining
 performance
 obligation
 and
 I


see
 Chris
 like,
 "Hey,
 Emit,
 what
 do
 you


think
 about
 Bonnie
 Blue?"
 I'm
 like,
 I
 I


I


>> I
 was
 trying
 to
 talk
 about
 Bonnie
 Blues


remaining
 performance
 obligation.
 What


are
 you
 talking
 [laughter]
 about?


[gasps]


>> All
 right,
 Nvidia,
 what
 the
 hell
 is


going
 on?
 How
 did
 how
 did
 how
 did
 you


make
 this
 pivot
 for
 Nvidia?


>> Okay,
 so
 there's
 a
 couple
 of
 things
 that


I
 think
 really
 changed
 changed
 my
 mind


on
 Nvidia.
 Number
 one,
 just
 from
 a
 I'll


go
 with
 technicals
 and
 then
 I'll
 go
 with


fundamentals.
 So
 the
 first
 thing
 is
 just


from
 a
 technical
 side,
 you
 can
 see
 that


there's
 been
 a
 giant
 wave
 of


consolidation
 at
 this
 like
 170
 to
 like


185
 um
 level,
 right?
 Where
 it's
 kind
 of


like
 bounced
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 to
 the
 200s


and
 then
 it's
 kind
 of
 come
 down,
 but
 you


can
 see
 that
 it's
 starting
 to
 like


develop
 a
 nice
 little
 support
 line


around
 that
 185.
 And
 so
 if
 you
 guys
 know


with
 options,
 what
 happens
 is
 when
 a


when
 a
 stock
 tends
 to
 kind
 of
 just
 like


start
 flatlining,
 the
 IV
 drops
 off.
 I


mean,
 there
 were
 momentary
 periods
 where


the
 IV
 kind
 of
 spiked
 up
 like
 you
 saw


during
 earnings
 and
 it
 was
 just
 like


boom
 and
 IV
 went
 up,
 but
 then
 you
 kind


of
 saw
 it
 come
 down
 again.
 So,
 just
 from


an
 option
 standpoint,
 you're
 getting
 a


really
 good
 deal.
 Um,
 and
 a
 lot
 of these


options,
 especially
 the
 ones
 for
 2028,


they
 came
 out
 in
 September,
 right?
 So,


if
 you
 had
 bought
 those
 options
 in


September,
 you
 know,
 because
 of
 theta


decay,
 they
 would
 have
 come
 down.
 And


so,
 right
 now,
 from
 just
 from
 an
 option


standpoint,
 it
 was
 attractive.
 Like
 for


me
 especially
 because
 you
 know
 me
 I
 do


leaps
 right
 so
 whenever
 you
 see
 this


period
 of
 nice
 consolidation
 that's
 one


thing
 the
 other
 thing
 now
 is
 what
 are


some
 of
 the
 catalysts
 that
 are
 up
 and


coming
 for
 Nvidia


I
 think
 this
 whole
 thing
 that
 happened


to
 Google
 where
 Google
 came
 out
 and


released
 Gemini
 and
 everything
 else
 it


sort
 of
 put
 this


fire
 under
 Jensen
 under
 OpenAI
 and
 all


of
 these
 guys
 to
 really
 invest
 harder


Right?
 So,
 same
 thing
 with
 Oracle
 and


all
 these
 other
 guys.
 They
 have
 to
 put


more
 money
 into
 this
 in
 order
 to
 stay


relevant.
 Now,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 if


you
 think
 about
 it,
 who
 is
 the
 biggest


arms
 dealer
 in
 this
 AI
 war?
 It's
 Nvidia,


right?
 So,
 right
 now,
 you're
 seeing


Google
 starting
 to
 spend
 more.
 So,
 a
 lot


of
 people
 are
 going
 to
 say,
 "Well,
 I


need
 to
 improve
 mine."
 So,
 Anthropic's


going
 to
 spend
 their
 money.
 OpenAI
 is


going
 to
 spend
 their
 money.
 You're
 going


to
 see
 a
 lot
 more
 people
 um
 gravitating


towards
 that.
 So,
 the
 spending
 is
 just


going
 to
 go
 right
 into
 Nvidia's
 uh


Nvidia's
 back
 pocket.
 Um,
 so
 if
 you


guys,
 if
 anyone
 here
 in
 the
 chat
 watches


F1,
 you
 guys
 know
 that
 there's
 about
 10


teams
 that
 compete
 every
 single
 year,


but
 there's
 only
 usually
 two
 engine


manufacturers
 that
 really
 um
 that


basically
 win.
 It's
 like
 one
 out
 of
 two


win,
 right?
 though
 if
 you
 think
 about


it,
 Nvidia's
 one,
 Apple,
 like
 AMD
 and


all
 these
 guys,
 they're,
 you
 know,


they're
 they're
 in
 the
 fringes,
 but
 TPUs


with
 Google
 is
 another
 big
 big
 driver
 of


AI
 um
 AI
 capex.
 But
 Nvidia
 specifically


right
 now
 is
 in
 a
 prime
 position
 to
 take


huge
 huge
 amount
 of
 gains
 um
 in
 this


next
 cycle
 with
 Blackwell.
 Like
 I
 really


have
 to
 do
 a
 lot
 more
 fundamental


analysis
 on
 Blackwell.
 So
 right
 now


everyone
 is
 transitioning
 from
 um
 from


training
 to
 inference
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at


the
 levels
 of
 like
 what's
 the
 word


the
 exponential
 difference
 between
 H100s


and
 black
 walls
 it's
 insane
 right
 so
 on


one
 hand
 you
 have
 the
 total
 cost
 of


ownership
 you
 know
 it's
 all
 these
 old


H100s
 that
 are
 still
 being
 fully


utilized
 and
 right
 now
 these
 a
 these


LLMs
 are
 hitting
 capacity
 walls
 that's


why
 like
 Right
 now
 I
 have
 Gemini
 Ultra


and
 once
 in
 a
 while
 like
 right
 now
 I'm


every
 time
 I
 search
 for
 something
 or
 I


you
 know
 run
 something
 it's
 like
 hey


sorry
 I
 I'm
 out
 of
 I'm
 out
 of
 uh
 I'm
 out


of
 juice
 right
 now.
 You're
 going
 to
 have


to
 wait.
 Clearly
 shows
 that
 there's
 a


there's
 just
 an
 insane
 amount
 of
 demand


right
 now.
 All
 of
 that
 is
 going
 to
 flow


to
 the
 hyper
 I
 mean
 so
 basically
 now


from
 an
 economy
 standpoint
 if
 you
 see


this
 entire
 planet
 right
 now
 is
 all


going
 into
 a
 AI
 at
 the
 same
 exact
 time.


Now
 if
 you
 think
 about
 a
 couple
 of


constraints
 that
 people
 are
 also
 going


to
 run
 into
 like
 electricity,
 right?


Everyone
 here
 knows
 the
 cost
 of


electricity
 is
 just
 starting
 to
 go


higher
 and
 higher.
 Data
 centers
 are
 just


developing
 themselves
 into
 another
 level


and
 then
 you
 have
 like
 the
 the
 grid
 can


only
 take
 so
 much
 before
 new
 capacity
 is


added.


>> Jensen
 Jensen
 is
 going
 to
 host
 a
 talk


about
 data
 centers
 and
 power
 shortages.


It
 was
 announced


>> now.
 Here's
 the
 thing.
 What
 is
 that


going
 to
 do?
 That's
 going
 to
 make
 people


that's
 going
 to
 force
 a
 lot
 of
 these


data
 center
 people
 to
 do
 what?
 To


actually


um
 do
 their
 upgrade
 cycle
 faster
 than


what
 they
 were
 originally
 hoping
 for.
 So


right
 now,
 if
 you're
 running
 an
 H100,


you
 have
 to
 run
 quite
 a
 few
 H100s
 to
 get


the
 same
 amount
 of
 output
 as
 one


Blackwell.
 So
 like
 from
 an
 equation


standpoint,
 it's
 like,
 hm,
 do
 I
 keep


running
 even
 though
 I've
 already
 fully


paid
 off
 this
 H100?
 Do
 I
 let
 it
 keep


running,
 pay
 all
 these
 additional
 all


this
 additional
 money
 for
 electricity,


or
 do
 I
 work
 on
 up
 uh
 work
 on
 expediting


my
 upgrade
 cycle
 to
 Blackwell
 where
 I


can
 generate
 way
 more
 tokens
 at
 a
 much


lower
 cost?
 Because
 that's
 the
 key,


right?
 To
 total
 total
 cost
 of
 ownership


um
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 a
 really
 big
 um


selling
 point
 for
 Blackwell.
 And
 so


that's
 why
 if
 you
 look
 at
 Jensen,
 he's


actually
 even
 and
 he's
 even
 given
 you


like
 really
 good
 guidance
 saying,
 "Look,


we
 actually
 know
 how
 much
 we're
 going
 to


do
 next
 year
 in
 in
 contracts.
 They're


gonna
 do
 $300
 billion
 in
 revenue
 next


year."


>> Insane,
 right?
 What
 about
 the


cyclicality
 argument?
 Because
 that
 I


think
 was
 your
 biggest
 bare
 case.
 That


was
 another
 thing
 that
 I
 had
 to
 kind
 of


like
 flip
 around
 and
 flip
 around
 on


because
 as
 I
 did
 more
 research,
 I
 was


like,
 "Okay,
 how
 is
 Nvidia
 going
 to
 get


past
 the
 cyclicality?"
 Number
 one,
 you


can
 see
 that
 they're
 investing
 in
 the


smaller
 company.
 So,
 you
 can
 see
 like,


hey,
 a
 billion
 dollars
 in
 share
 buybacks


that
 a
 PE
 of
 60
 isn't
 exactly
 value


accreative
 to
 shareholders
 to
 the
 same


degree
 as
 investing
 in
 a
 company
 for
 a


billion
 dollars
 and
 then
 this
 company


turns
 into
 a
 $500
 billion
 company.
 Look


at
 the
 all
 the
 deals
 with
 Anthropic
 and


all
 of
 these
 other
 other
 guys
 out
 there.


So,
 number
 one,
 they're
 saying,
 "Well,


we're
 not
 only
 going
 to
 supply
 the
 arms


to
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 AI
 companies,
 but


we're
 also
 going
 to
 take
 equity


investments
 that
 could
 give
 exponential


returns
 in
 the
 future."
 It's
 very


similar
 to
 what
 Google
 does
 with
 Google


um
 what
 is
 it
 called?
 Uh


>> Google
 Ventures.
 Google
 Vent
 Google


Ventures
 where
 they
 do
 these
 equity


investments
 and
 you
 know
 most
 of
 them


are
 going
 to
 go
 out
 of
 they're
 going
 to


get
 they're
 going
 to
 go
 to
 zero
 but
 the


ones
 that
 are
 going
 to
 make
 it
 are
 going


to
 be
 exceptionally
 profitable.


[clears throat]
 Look
 at
 the
 example
 of


Google
 Ventures
 investing
 in
 SpaceX.


They
 did
 not
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 to
 be


in
 SpaceX
 but
 when
 SpaceX
 goes
 IPO,
 do


you
 know
 what
 the
 total
 return
 on
 that


money
 is
 going
 to?


>> I
 think
 it's
 like
 56x.
 Yeah.


>> Crazy,
 right?
 So
 Nvidia
 is
 in
 that
 same


position
 right
 now
 where
 they're


generating
 so
 much
 cash
 flow
 that
 they


can
 throw
 money
 around
 everywhere
 and


they
 literally
 can
 can
 hope
 for
 one
 or


two
 or
 three
 things
 going
 50x
 like


SpaceX
 right
 now
 and
 they
 actually
 have


a
 lot
 more
 insight
 into
 what's
 working


and
 what's
 not
 from
 from
 a
 from
 a
 from


an
 investor
 standpoint
 because
 they're


essentially
 providing
 all
 the
 basically


the
 arms,
 right?
 So
 that's
 one
 thing.


The
 other
 thing
 is
 if
 you
 see
 like
 some


of
 the
 deals
 that
 they
 have,
 they


actually
 have
 it
 so
 that
 per
 GPU
 they


have
 like
 licensing
 fees
 that
 eventually


will
 translate
 into
 long-term
 durable


revenue
 that's
 just
 going
 to
 be
 coming


in.
 So
 it's
 no
 longer
 just,
 hey,
 I'm


going
 to
 provide
 you
 the
 GPUs.
 Hey,
 I'm


going
 to
 license
 you
 uh
 what
 do
 you
 call


it?
 Like
 the
 CUDA
 software
 and


everything
 else
 for
 like
 $5,000
 per
 GPU


per
 year.
 So
 that's
 a
 pretty
 good
 return


and
 it's
 all
 high
 margin
 high
 margin


stuff.
 So
 I
 I
 would
 say
 those
 two
 are


the
 main
 factors
 that
 I
 would
 go
 there.


And
 then
 of
 course
 it's
 the
 massive


upgrade
 cycles
 that
 are
 coming.
 These


guys
 have
 five
 years
 worth
 of
 upgrade


cycles
 that
 are
 already
 planned
 out
 with


every
 upgrade
 cycle
 being
 more
 and
 more


and
 more
 value
 or
 creative.
 So
 this
 is


this
 is
 kind
 of
 a
 a
 dynamic
 where
 at


least
 for
 the
 foreseeable
 future
 at


least
 for
 the
 next
 5
 years
 the
 cycle
 is


not
 going
 to
 end.
 Could
 Nvidia
 the
 top


line
 slow
 down?
 Absolutely.
 But
 the
 cash


flows
 are
 going
 to
 be
 so
 strong
 that


it's
 actually
 going
 to
 support
 a
 decent


return
 even
 from
 where
 we
 are
 today.
 So


I
 think
 if
 you're
 expecting
 Nvidia
 to
 go


from,
 you
 know,
 from
 I
 think
 $200
 to


let's
 say
 a,000
 like
 that
 5x,
 I
 don't


know
 how
 how
 long
 it's
 going
 to
 take
 to


get
 there.
 It's
 going
 to
 like
 it
 that's


not
 even
 in
 my
 brain.
 But
 if
 you're


looking
 at
 a
 nice
 50%
 return
 from
 here


to
 get
 to
 300,
 I
 don't
 think
 that's


that's
 out
 of
 the
 table
 within
 a
 year
 or


two.
 So,
 let's
 uh
 let's
 give
 you
 a


little
 push
 back
 right
 here.
 Someone


says,
 "Nothing
 Chris
 said
 is
 new.
 The


main
 problem
 is
 that
 the
 valuation
 makes


no
 sense
 of
 revenue
 growth
 slows."
 Do


you
 disagree
 with
 revenue
 growth
 slowing


down?


>> Revenue
 growth
 is
 not
 slowing
 down,
 it's


accelerating,
 reacelerating.
 So,
 that


bare
 case
 is
 put
 to
 bed.
 And
 we
 haven't


even
 included
 China
 revenue.
 So,
 they


can
 now
 sell
 the
 H2
 China.
 To
 add
 on
 to


whatever
 Chris
 was
 saying,
 he's
 talking


about
 the
 new
 lines
 of
 chips
 coming
 out.


We
 have
 Reuben
 coming
 out
 next
 year,


okay?
 Because
 we
 already
 had
 the
 second


upgraded
 model
 Blackwell
 already
 being


released
 soon.
 And
 then
 why
 would
 they


give
 China
 the
 H200
 chips
 before
 it
 was


the
 H20
 chips
 if
 they
 weren't
 already


planning
 to
 have
 a
 much
 powerful
 model


coming
 out
 later
 on?
 Like
 they're
 not


going
 to
 do
 that,
 right?
 I
 don't
 know if


I
 really
 believe
 in
 Luckick
 when
 he
 says


like,
 "Oh,
 we
 don't
 want
 the
 25%
 sales,


you
 know,
 whatever,
 all
 that
 crap."
 But


at
 the
 same
 time,
 they're
 not
 going
 to


let
 China
 catch
 up.
 They're
 going
 to


release
 way
 better
 models
 coming
 up
 soon


and
 the
 hyperscalers
 are
 going
 to
 want


those
 chips.
 They're
 not
 going
 to
 want


the
 second
 tier
 chips.
 They're
 not
 going


to
 want
 the
 model
 that's
 two
 years
 ago.


They're
 going
 to
 want
 the
 best
 model


that's
 out
 there,
 which
 really
 puts
 that


cyclicality
 to
 bed
 at
 a
 certain
 point.


>> So,
 one
 thing
 by
 the
 way,
 what
 do
 you


think
 your
 return
 would
 be
 if
 you
 bought


Apple
 in
 the
 year
 2000?
 A
 lot.
 But
 would


you
 not
 have
 bought
 it
 in
 2010?
 Were
 you


late
 in
 2010?
 No,
 because
 you
 still
 had


a
 really
 good
 return.
 What
 about
 if
 you


bought
 it
 in
 2020?
 Do
 you
 think
 that


that
 person
 who
 bought
 in
 2020
 is
 too


late?
 No,
 they
 still
 did
 a
 really
 good


job.
 So
 this
 whole
 thing
 about,
 oh,


you're
 too
 late.
 Maybe
 I'm
 too
 late
 to


get
 that
 100x
 return,
 but
 dude,
 if
 I'm


looking
 from
 a
 portfolio
 standpoint,


there's
 still
 a
 lot
 of
 opportunity
 here.


So
 this
 whole
 thing
 with
 someone
 being


late,
 dude,
 I
 I
 think
 that
 they
 they


still
 have
 a
 huge
 ramp
 up
 to
 go.
 Now,
 I


will
 I
 will
 say
 one
 thing
 for
 me.
 I
 have


been
 burned
 in
 the
 past
 by
 investing
 a


little
 bit
 too
 early
 into
 things.
 And


so,
 sometimes
 I'm
 like,
 you
 know what,
 I


take
 a
 much
 more
 bearish
 bearish
 tone
 to


my
 thesis.
 But
 I
 think
 right
 now
 you
 can


actually
 see
 that
 everything
 is
 working,


you
 know?
 So,
 it's
 almost
 like
 saying


with
 Google,
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 you
 know,


Google,
 you
 didn't
 invest
 in
 2005.
 That


means
 that
 you're
 dumb
 for
 not
 investing


in,
 you
 know,
 that
 that
 you
 can't
 invest


in
 2010."
 Bro,
 just
 at
 this
 point,
 you


know
 that
 they're
 successful.
 You
 know


that
 they're
 a
 proven
 provider
 of
 uh
 of


ARMS
 for
 AI,


there's
 still
 a
 lot
 of
 value
 going


forward.


>> Real
 quick,
 was
 your
 experience
 with


using
 Gemini
 also
 instrumental
 in
 just


realizing
 the
 models
 get
 better
 and


better,


>> inevitably
 Nvidia
 continues
 to
 win?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 rapid


improvement
 in
 in
 how
 how
 thinking
 and


reasoning
 is
 I
 think
 is
 the
 leaprog
 that


I
 was
 looking
 for.
 Like
 right
 now
 when


you
 look
 at
 when
 you
 do
 when
 you
 do
 your


research
 using
 some
 of
 these
 AI
 agents


they're
 no
 longer
 just
 regurgitating


information
 that
 they've
 been
 trained


on.
 They
 actually
 go
 out
 there.
 They


look
 they
 reason
 like
 a
 human
 being
 to


figure
 out
 like
 okay
 there's
 actually


something
 here.
 And
 then
 you
 work
 on


that
 and
 then
 you
 know
 there
 are
 still


areas
 where
 you
 you
 have
 to
 double


check,
 triple
 check
 and
 quadruple
 check


to
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 thing
 is
 not


hallucinated
 on
 you.
 But
 I
 think
 AI
 is


here
 to
 stay.
 The
 other
 thing
 is
 at
 work


every
 day
 I'm
 going
 to
 work
 and
 there's


just
 new
 products
 coming
 online
 and
 it's


like
 AI
 this
 and
 AI
 that
 and
 AI
 this.
 So


from
 an
 economic
 standpoint,
 you
 can


already
 see
 that
 AI
 [clears throat]
 is


pretty
 much
 eating
 all
 of
 these
 other


like
 not
 they're
 not
 eating
 the


applications,
 but
 every
 application
 now


has
 an
 AI
 component
 to
 it
 that
 feeds


right
 back
 into
 the
 hyperscalers.
 And


what
 are
 the
 hyperscalers
 doing?
 They're


buying
 NVIDIA
 chips.
 So
 the
 the
 unit


economics
 make
 a
 lot
 more
 sense.
 Like


right
 now,
 I
 work
 in
 radiology.
 I
 work


in
 radiology
 IT.
 I
 have
 a
 ton
 of


applications
 right
 now
 that
 we're
 going


and
 we're
 upgrading
 and
 doing
 stuff
 and


all
 of
 them
 have
 AI
 features.
 Now
 all
 of


them
 they
 have
 connections
 to
 AWS.
 They


have
 connections
 to
 GCP
 to
 Microsoft.
 So


all
 of
 the
 cost
 savings
 that
 we're


getting
 from
 utilizing
 this
 AI
 feature


for
 all
 these
 radiology
 services
 that
 we


typically
 had
 to
 spend
 money
 on,
 all


those
 efficiency
 gains
 are
 kind
 of


getting
 filtered
 to
 the
 to
 the
 cloud


providers
 and
 then
 from
 the
 cloud


providers
 now
 it's
 going
 to


>> and
 that's
 why
 you
 don't
 see
 revenue


growth
 slowing
 down.


>> So
 I'll
 give
 you
 an
 example
 of
 something


that
 I've
 I
 right
 now
 if
 you
 look
 at
 how


radiology
 works.
 radiology.


The
 bottleneck
 in
 radiology
 in
 the
 past


tended
 to
 be
 the
 machines
 themselves.
 We


actually
 had
 to
 take
 film
 and
 do
 the


films
 and
 then
 process
 the
 film,
 take
 it


and
 then
 we
 give
 it
 to
 the
 radiologist.


The
 radiologist
 reads
 it,
 you
 know,
 and


it's
 it
 was
 like
 a
 nightmare
 scenario.


Then
 of
 course
 we
 became
 we
 went
 to
 a


pack
 system
 where
 basically
 everything


was
 electronic.
 You
 sent
 the
 images
 to


packs.
 Now
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 people
 think


well
 those
 efficiency
 gains
 who
 did
 that


really
 benefit?
 Well
 number
 one
 it


benefited
 all
 the
 manufacturers
 of
 the


equipment
 that
 that
 provided
 all
 this


additional
 stuff
 but
 then
 it
 also
 was


all
 these
 software
 providers
 that


provided
 the
 software.
 Now
 we're
 headed


into
 this
 place
 where
 my
 radiologists


are
 working
 and
 they
 need
 AI
 in
 order
 to


function.
 Like
 there
 are
 so
 many


applications
 that
 are
 basically
 helping


them
 become
 more
 efficient
 that
 it's


saving
 the
 hospital
 a
 ton
 of
 time
 and


actually
 like
 we
 don't
 have
 to
 hire


nearly
 as
 many
 people.
 I
 mean
 I'm
 sure


the
 radiologists
 don't
 want
 to
 hear
 that


but
 the
 productivity
 levels
 have


increased
 significantly.
 Accuracy
 is


increasing
 significantly.
 So
 from
 a
 cost


perspective
 the
 cost
 of
 healthcare
 is


actually
 coming
 down
 because
 of
 AI.
 And


that's
 one
 of
 the
 thesis
 that
 I
 was


going to
 talk
 to
 you
 about
 with
 regards


to
 um
 AI
 and
 deflation.
 You
 know,
 one
 of


the
 things
 and
 I
 I'm
 sure
 that
 this
 has


been
 spoken
 about
 in
 great
 lengths,
 but


every
 time
 there's
 been
 a
 sea
 change
 in


technology,
 that's
 heavily
 heavily


deflationary,


right?
 So,
 you
 have
 this
 wave
 of


disinflation
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 coming


our
 way
 thanks
 to
 AI.
 You
 know,
 if
 you


look
 at
 how
 the
 hospitals
 work
 back
 in


the
 day,
 the
 cost
 of
 serving
 one
 patient


was
 like
 the
 the
 effort
 that
 you
 had
 to


put
 in
 was
 enormous.
 But
 then
 came
 in


computers
 and
 everything
 else
 and
 kind


of
 revolutionized
 everything
 and
 our


throughput
 went
 up
 and
 the
 the
 amount
 of


care
 that
 we
 were
 able
 to
 deliver
 went


up.
 Sure
 costs
 went
 up
 because
 we
 had
 to


kind
 of
 like
 help
 and
 support


everything,
 but
 overall
 the
 improvements


in
 healthcare
 are
 like
 a
 hundred
 times


more
 than
 they
 were
 in
 the
 1980s
 before


all
 this
 electronic
 stuff
 came.
 So
 AI
 is


still
 in
 its
 infancy.
 So
 I
 say
 five


years,
 six
 years,
 even
 10
 years
 from


now,
 people
 are
 just
 going
 to
 people
 are


going
 to
 be
 freaked
 out
 about
 how
 many


things
 that
 um
 are
 going
 to
 have
 AI
 in


it.
 And
 so
 if
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 in


the
 sector,
 uh
 you're
 missing
 the
 you're


missing
 a
 giant
 sea
 change.
 And
 that's


the
 way
 that
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 looking
 at
 it


from
 here.
 Do
 I
 think
 that
 there
 could


be
 a
 correction
 20
 30%.
 Sure.
 But
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 how
 many


areas
 of
 opportunity
 that
 companies
 like


uh
 Nvidia
 have
 where
 they're
 literally


integrated
 into
 an
 industry
 and
 they're


helping
 supercharge
 an
 industry,
 it's


it's
 insane.
 And
 then
 at
 the
 same
 time,


they
 do
 have
 a
 significant
 mo
 there's


only
 one
 or
 two
 major
 major
 players
 here


that
 are
 able
 to
 do
 what
 Nvidia
 does.


That
 gives
 them
 a
 significant
 lead.
 And


as
 far
 as
 I
 can
 tell,
 the
 hunger
 levels


on
 Jensen
 have
 not
 gone
 down
 even
 the


slightest.
 It'd
 be
 one
 thing
 if
 he
 was


just
 chilling
 on
 the
 beach
 saying,


"Yeah,
 I'm
 going
 to
 chill."
 This
 guy


seems
 like
 he's
 still
 a
 hungry
 dog.
 Be


like,
 "I'm
 going
 to
 crush
 Google.
 I


don't
 give
 a
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 what


I
 need
 to
 do."
 You
 don't
 want
 to
 bet
 on


a
 guy
 like
 that.
 I
 don't
 know
 about


y'all,
 but
 I


>> I
 I
 agree.
 And
 and
 we'll
 get
 more
 into


this
 deflation
 thesis
 as
 well
 in
 terms


of
 what
 the
 Fed
 did.
 Sam,
 do
 you


disagree
 with
 anything
 that
 Chris
 said?


And
 you're
 not
 long
 Nvidia.
 So,
 how
 are


you
 thinking
 about
 Nvidia
 as
 well?


>> No,
 I
 mean
 [clears throat]


Chris
 getting
 long
 invid,


uh,
 he's
 been
 bearish
 until
 now,
 which


means
 that
 this
 is
 it.
 They
 get
 I'm
 just


getting
 around.
 Um,
 I
 mean,
 I've
 known


Chris
 for
 a
 while.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 you've


known
 him
 longer
 than
 I
 have.
 And
 Chris


is
 more
 about
 the
 timing,
 not
 so
 much


like
 getting
 it
 at
 the
 bottom,
 the


absolute
 bottom,
 like,
 you
 know,
 I'm


gonna
 buy
 Hood
 at
 like
 $8,
 gonna
 buy


Palanteer
 at
 $15,
 whatever.
 He's
 about


the
 timing.
 So
 Chris
 is
 like
 basically


Stanley
 drunker
 where
 he
 finds
 his


conviction
 in
 a
 company
 and
 he
 levers


the
 hell
 up
 when
 he
 finds
 that


opportunity
 and
 there's
 a
 reason
 why
 he


names
 his
 profile
 inside
 a
 trader


opportunity
 something
 whatever
 but
 like


Chris
 is
 more
 like
 opportunity
 when
 they


risk
 reward
 is
 asymmetric
 upside
 which


namely
 with
 UNH
 where
 he
 I
 don't
 want
 to


see
 he
 didn't
 nail
 the
 bottom
 I
 mean


Chris
 like
 you
 didn't
 nail
 the
 bottom


but
 you
 kept
 adding
 adding
 because


conviction
 was
 high
 and
 then
 it
 bottomed


eventually
 and
 then
 it
 went
 up
 to
 380


bucks
 and
 then
 like
 you
 kind
 of
 covered


your
 position,
 right?
 Like
 you
 you
 don't


need
 like
 these
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 be


like
 20%
 pounder
 from
 the
 bottom
 and


then
 still
 holding
 sort
 of
 thing
 to
 make


money
 in
 the
 market.
 I'm
 not
 discounting


that
 at
 all
 because
 you
 guys
 made
 a


crapload
 of
 money
 being
 10
 times
 in
 your


stock.
 I
 don't know,
 20,
 25
 times,


whatever
 it
 is.
 Like,
 yeah,
 you
 can
 make


money
 that,
 but
 you
 could
 also
 make


money
 this
 way,
 too,
 right?
 Like,
 did
 he


catch
 the
 bottom
 of
 video?
 No.
 Did
 he


catch
 video
 when
 it
 was
 $15
 pre-split
 or


when
 it's
 $15
 postsplit?
 No,
 he
 didn't.


But
 look,
 if
 Nvidia
 goes
 to
 220
 bucks,


230,
 250.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 let's
 just
 say


he's
 gonna
 buy
 Carnival
 Cruise
 Lines


yacht
 and
 we're
 all
 gonna
 have
 the
 next


meet
 up
 over
 there.


>> Sam,
 do
 you
 think
 250
 next
 year?
 And


then
 Chris,
 after
 Sam,
 what
 is
 your


price
 target,
 I
 guess,
 for
 Nvidia
 next


year
 for
 both
 of
 you
 if
 you
 have


>> Well,
 it's
 contingent
 on
 the
 market


staying
 bullish,
 right?
 Like
 I
 it's
 so


difficult
 to
 give
 a
 price
 target
 on


certain
 things.
 Like
 I
 think
 that
 Nvidia


is
 going
 to
 go
 to
 $300.
 All right.
 I


think
 it's
 go
 to
 $300
 by
 2028
 because
 I


think
 the
 AI
 theme
 is
 going
 to
 continue.


But
 I
 don't
 know
 like
 if
 the
 market


decides
 like
 one
 day,
 hey,
 I
 want
 to


sell
 off
 everything
 cuz
 Trump
 decided
 to


start
 tweeting
 a
 bunch
 of
 stuff
 and
 it's


down
 like
 limit
 down
 like
 7%
 overnight.


It's
 down
 like
 I
 can't
 you
 can't
 prevent


that,
 right?
 Like
 Nvidia
 is
 a
 five


trillion,
 not
 five,
 it's
 a
 $4
 trillion


market
 cap.
 If
 the
 market's
 down
 23%,


it's
 going
 to
 fall.
 There
 will
 be
 risk


coming
 off
 the
 table.
 Like
 this
 isn't
 a


freaking
 Proctor
 and
 Gamble
 or
 this


isn't
 a
 Kellanova,
 whatever
 it
 is.
 Like


this
 is
 a
 growth
 stock,
 high
 beta
 tech.


If
 the
 market
 goes
 down,
 this
 is
 gonna


come
 down.
 So,
 in
 order
 for
 this
 thesis


to
 come
 through,
 the
 market
 has
 to
 stay


bullish.
 But
 I
 I
 made
 a
 black
 swan.
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 happen
 anytime


soon.
 I
 think
 the
 market
 is
 balls
 to
 the


wall
 bullish.
 We
 You
 saw
 the
 commentary


yesterday
 from
 Jerome
 Pal,
 which
 I
 was


wholly
 surprised.
 I
 did
 not
 think
 it
 was


going to
 be
 a
 dovish
 cut.
 I
 thought
 it


was
 a
 hawkish
 cut.
 It
 was
 the
 most


dovish
 cut
 we
 could
 have
 possibly


gotten.
 They
 started,
 they
 basically


started
 QE,
 or
 quote
 unquote,
 they're


going to
 start
 QE
 next
 quarter.
 Rates


are
 coming
 down.
 Inflation's
 tame.


Unemployment
 is
 tame.


GDP
 is
 going
 to
 be
 23%
 which
 I
 don't


believe.
 But
 we
 have
 the
 most


>> Yeah,
 I
 know.
 But
 but
 like
 this
 is
 the


perfect
 setup
 for
 Nvidia.
 This
 is
 the


perfect
 setup
 for
 the
 market.
 Like
 how


could
 you
 be
 bearish
 at
 this
 point?
 Like


yeah,
 we
 break
 the
 50-day
 moving
 average


or
 break
 the
 20-day
 moving
 average.


Okay,
 it's
 time
 to
 get
 bearish,
 guys.


But
 until
 then,
 man,
 the
 market
 is
 just


built
 to
 go
 up.
 Like
 I
 it
 just
 I
 got


bearish
 when
 we
 broke
 below
 the
 50-day


moving
 average,
 right?
 I
 got
 bearish


when
 we
 broke
 below
 the
 20-day
 moving


average
 temporarily.
 50-day
 moving


average.
 I
 got
 bearish.
 I
 didn't
 add
 to


anything.
 I
 bought
 puts,
 whatever.
 And


like
 it
 worked
 out,
 right?
 But
 but
 like


when
 we're
 trading
 above
 the
 moving


average,
 we're
 trading
 above
 all
 the


EMAs
 when
 everyone's
 boss
 wall
 bullish


and
 then
 you
 have
 Wall
 Street
 basically


like
 raising
 raising
 price
 stock.
 It's


like
 that's
 not
 the
 time
 to
 get
 bearish.


It's
 time
 when
 you
 stay
 bullish.
 When


things
 fall
 apart,
 that's
 when
 you
 get


bearish,
 right?
 And
 it's
 about
 the


timing
 in
 this
 case,
 right?
 And
 if
 he's


landing
 himself
 in
 leaps
 and
 spreads
 for


2027
 right
 now
 and
 Nvidia's
 trading
 230


bucks,
 get
 ready
 because
 the
 next
 meet


is
 going
 to
 be
 on
 Chris's
 yacht.


>> Chris,
 your
 target
 for
 Nvidia.


>> In
 the
 short
 to
 medium
 term,
 the
 200,


it'll
 recapture
 200
 I
 think
 within
 the


next
 like
 20
 to
 I
 would
 say
 maybe
 30
 to


60
 days.
 I
 think
 once
 we
 see
 some


catalysts
 start
 to
 come
 up,
 I
 mean,
 and


Jensen
 goes
 on
 his
 PR
 tour
 and
 I
 think


Q1
 especially
 when
 they
 start
 to
 give


out
 guidance
 for
 next
 year,
 I
 think
 that


that's
 going
 to
 really
 cement
 the
 deal,


right?
 Um,
 you
 already
 see
 the
 Trump


administration
 sort
 of
 kind
 of
 like


saying,
 um,
 we're
 going
 to
 support
 this


industry
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 boost
 it
 up.


I
 mean,
 dude,
 that's
 a
 really
 good
 sign.


One
 of
 the
 things
 about
 Trump
 is
 that


he's
 a
 good
 salesman
 for
 for
 um
 for


companies
 and
 for
 industries.
 So,
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 you
 can
 see
 is
 that
 we


as
 the
 United
 States
 are
 heavily
 leaning


towards
 supporting
 this
 entire
 AI


ecosystem
 that
 we
 have
 going.
 So,
 that


is
 a
 nice
 put
 that
 you
 have
 on
 the


market
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 AI.
 So,
 I
 think


that's
 one
 one
 thing.
 And
 then
 of
 course


like
 I
 said
 this
 release
 of
 black
 uh


blackwell
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 gamecher
 in


terms
 of
 where
 we're
 headed
 um
 with


regards
 to
 the
 expectations
 for
 Nvidia


at least
 for
 next
 year
 and
 then
 I
 think


it
 I
 think
 it
 can
 capture
 250
 to
 275
 by


the
 end
 of
 two
 2026


and
 then
 possibly
 get
 to
 that
 300
 by


2028.
 So,
 you
 know,
 like
 I
 said,
 it's


Nvidia
 is
 in
 this
 show
 me
 stage
 right


now
 and
 I
 think
 that
 they're
 delivering.


You
 know,
 they're
 they're
 doing
 what


they
 need
 to.
 So,


well,
 let's
 bring
 on
 someone
 else
 to
 the


show
 who's
 been
 a
 little
 bullish
 on


Nvidia
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 years.


>> McMan.


>> Yes,
 he's
 here.


>> Steve,
 I
 think
 you
 got
 to
 witness
 the


Chris
 pivot
 a
 day
 before
 it
 happened.


So,
 what
 is
 your
 perspective
 on
 all


this?


>> I
 got
 to
 witness
 it
 in
 real
 time.


I
 mean,
 he
 convinced
 himself
 on
 Monday


night
 that
 he
 was
 going
 to
 do
 this.


[laughter]


[gasps]


>> Still
 doesn't
 know
 how
 to
 use
 a


microphone.


>> That's
 still
 pretty
 accurate.
 No,
 I
 do,


you
 know,
 but
 sometimes
 silence
 is


golden.
 So,


>> yeah.
 I
 mean,
 listen,
 I'm
 I'm
 glad
 that


he's
 on
 team
 Nvidia
 at
 the
 moment.
 And


the
 numbers
 support
 it.
 So,
 I
 was


listening
 before
 I
 was
 finishing


something
 up.
 That's
 why
 I
 didn't
 hop
 on


immediately.
 And
 look,
 Chris
 is
 right.


It
 doesn't
 matter
 when
 you
 get
 in
 as


long
 as
 you
 make
 money
 on
 something.
 And


none
 of
 us
 can
 time
 anything
 perfectly.


I
 sure
 as
 hell
 can't.
 But
 nobody
 should


be
 ragging
 on
 anybody
 for
 when
 you
 get


into
 something
 if
 you
 have
 the
 balls
 and


the
 conviction
 to
 actually
 get
 in
 on
 it.


And
 I
 really
 do
 think
 that
 Chris
 hit
 the


number
 on
 the
 head.
 I
 said
 it
 earlier


today
 that
 I
 would
 not
 be
 surprised
 if


Nvidia
 hits
 250
 to
 275
 next
 year.
 And


that's
 without
 any
 assumptions
 that
 the


forward
 estimates
 increase
 as
 they
 have


been
 after
 every
 quarterly
 report.
 At


this
 point,
 Nvidia
 is
 the
 cheapest
 in


the
 Mag
 7
 and
 it
 could
 continue
 to
 look


cheaper.
 The
 reality
 is
 Jensen's
 going


to
 hit
 65
 billion
 of
 revenue
 in
 Q4.


There
 really
 is
 not
 a
 scenario
 where
 he


doesn't,


especially
 now
 that
 the
 China
 trade
 is


on
 the
 table.
 Now,
 maybe
 that
 doesn't


materialize
 in
 Q4.
 That
 sure
 as
 hell
 is


going
 to
 materialize
 in
 either
 Q1
 or
 Q2.


So
 in
 2026,


we
 could
 see
 an
 additional
 10
 to
 20


billion
 of
 revenue
 come
 in
 on
 top
 of


everything
 else.
 The
 Oracle
 numbers
 last


night
 confirmed


and
 the
 AI
 bears
 are
 incorrect
 and
 I'm


going
 to
 slaughter
 them
 either
 tonight


or
 tomorrow
 with
 a
 two
 or
 three
 thousand


word
 post
 on
 X.
 But
 the
 numbers
 from


Oracle
 confirmed
 that
 this
 buildout
 is


as
 real
 as
 it's
 ever
 been.
 The
 RPO


number
 from
 Oracle
 confirmed
 what
 all


the
 rest
 of
 the
 hyperscalers
 said
 a


couple
 of
 weeks
 ago.
 The
 demand
 for


Nvidia
 chips
 is
 off
 the
 charts.
 And
 I


don't
 see
 a
 scenario
 where
 their
 revenue


gets
 impacted
 next
 year.
 And
 I'm


starting
 to
 think
 that
 my
 initial


projections
 of
 when
 this
 turns
 more
 into


maintenance
 mode
 than
 growth
 mode
 is


going
 to
 get
 extended
 out
 to
 2028


probably
 at
 this
 point.


Yeah,
 I
 would
 agree.
 And
 I
 I I
 also


agree
 that
 although
 the
 market
 is
 not


trusting
 Oracle's
 debt
 financing,
 that


RPO
 growth,
 if
 you
 think
 it's
 real,
 even


if
 half
 of
 it's
 real,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


money
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 coming
 into


>> Oracle
 is
 going
 to
 be
 dead
 money


[clears throat]
 for
 a
 couple
 of
 years


and
 then
 it'll
 explode.
 It's
 in
 a


horrible
 situation
 right
 now.


>> Agreed.
 Uh
 Chris,
 before
 we
 move
 on
 to


the
 Fed
 because
 this
 is
 Macro
 Thursday,


any
 thoughts
 on
 Broadcom?
 I
 mean,
 seems


like
 a
 relatively
 strong
 quarter.


I
 mean,
 we
 we
 sort
 of
 knew
 that
 Broadcom


was
 going
 to
 do
 well,
 you
 know,
 just


based
 on
 the
 level
 of
 uh
 level
 of
 capex


guide
 that
 we
 saw
 from
 Google.
 You
 know,


when
 Google
 does
 well,
 you're
 going
 to


see
 Broadcom
 do
 well.
 Why?
 Because
 the


TPUs
 are
 are
 um
 are
 partially
 developed


by
 Broadcom,
 right?
 Broadcom,
 I
 think


Marll
 and
 MediaTek.
 So,
 there's
 like


that
 that
 Google
 ecosystem
 is
 there.
 So,


a
 lot
 of
 these
 custom
 AS6
 businesses


really
 going
 to
 boost
 up
 uh
 boost
 up


Broadcom.
 up.
 Broadcom's
 doing
 what


Broadcom
 does.
 Now,
 here's
 the
 thing.


Broadcom's
 valuation
 is
 actually
 higher.


It's
 overvalued
 relative
 to
 Nvidia.
 So,


you're
 actually


>> a
 little
 aggressive
 100
 times
 forward


earnings
 a
 little
 bit.
 It's
 growing


fast,
 but
 Nvidia
 at
 25.
 What
 are
 we


talking
 about?


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 mean,
 personally,
 I
 like


looking
 at
 EV
 to
 EBA
 as
 a
 better
 better


metric
 co
 because
 it
 it
 gives
 you
 a


little
 bit
 more
 of
 an
 accurate


reflection
 on
 how
 a
 company's
 doing.
 So


if
 we
 just
 compare
 let's
 say
 AVGO


broadcom
 and
 let
 me
 just
 share
 which
 by


the
 way
 guys
 Broadcom
 still
 holding
 that


three
 and
 a
 half%
 move.
 The
 call
 I
 think


is
 just
 starting.
 So
 any
 bullish


questions
 or
 answers
 from
 Hopan
 maybe


takes
 this
 a
 bit
 higher.


>> Yeah.


Yeah.
 Two
 trillion
 market
 cap
 basically


right
 now.
 So
 if
 we
 look
 the
 forward
 e
 i


e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i ea


we
 can
 see


give
 it
 a
 second
 to
 load


and
 by


there
 we
 go
 bring
 this
 down


okay
 so
 right
 now
 you
 can
 see
 broadcoms


EV
 to
 IB
 is
 77
 okay
 Nvidia
 is
 21


>> okay
 Nvidia
 with
 its
 growth
 rate
 should


not
 be
 trading
 this
 low.
 It
 should
 be
 at


a
 much
 much
 higher
 higher
 higher
 rate


right
 now.
 Let
 me
 just
 actually
 hide
 the


evida
 number.
 So
 on
 a
 forward
 basis
 you


can
 see
 that
 at
 one
 point
 Broadcom
 was


the
 undervalued
 um
 company
 but
 now
 you


can
 see
 that
 uh
 Nvidia
 because
 it's
 been


growing
 its
 IBIDA
 so
 significantly
 but


the
 stock
 price
 hasn't
 caught
 up
 to
 it


is
 actually
 under
 under
 uh
 undervalued


relative
 to
 its
 its
 uh
 peer.
 So
 you
 can


see
 this
 thing
 capture
 about
 at least


going
 back
 to
 the
 28
 to
 30
 again


especially
 if
 optimism
 um
 comes
 back
 to


to
 Nvidia
 in
 which
 case
 now
 that
 250


target
 is
 going
 to
 be
 very
 it's
 going
 to


be
 very
 achievable.


>> I
 got
 breaking
 news
 and
 a
 question.


>> Yeah,
 Costco
 is
 down
 after
 hours


individually.


I'm
 excited
 because
 this
 company
 should


not
 be
 where
 it
 is
 now.
 Where
 does


everybody
 think
 when
 you're
 talking


about
 Nvidia?
 Should
 it
 get
 a
 bigger


valuation
 than
 Costco?


>> I
 love
 how
 Costco's
 down
 five
 bucks
 and


Steve's
 like,
 "It's
 down,
 guys.


>> It's
 down.
 Is
 it
 not
 down?
 Is
 it
 not


down?"


>> No,
 Costco
 does.
 I
 mean,
 those
 hot
 dogs


are
 $150.
 They
 haven't
 changed.
 But


also,
 I
 I
 think
 that
 you're
 seeing
 a


little
 bit
 of
 rotation
 in
 the
 markets.


But
 to
 push
 back
 a
 little
 bit
 on
 Chris's


point
 as
 far
 as
 the
 valuation
 of


Broadcom
 versus
 Nvidia,
 I
 think
 one


thing
 we
 need
 to
 keep
 in
 mind
 here
 is


that
 the
 market
 really
 follows
 in
 terms


of
 stock
 price
 EPS
 growth,
 right?
 So
 we


have
 an
 estimated
 EPS
 growth
 actually


under
 shooting
 next
 year
 for
 2026,
 which


is
 the
 reason
 why
 we're
 seeing
 the


market
 continue
 to
 go
 up.
 So
 like
 your


trailing
 P,
 Ford
 P,
 whatever
 it
 is,
 I


think
 it
 really
 matters
 on
 the
 uh
 second


derivative
 basis,
 which
 is
 the
 rate
 of


change,
 right?
 So
 the
 rate
 of
 change
 for


Broadcom
 actually
 is
 accelerating


from
 current
 at
 current
 quarter
 it
 was


34.4%
 which
 is
 the
 estimate.
 I
 don't


know
 what
 it
 actually
 came
 at.
 Next


quarter
 is
 30.8%
 but
 it's
 actually


reacelerating
 July
 of
 2026
 on
 a


quarterly
 basis
 to
 53.6%


and
 then
 53.3%
 the
 quarter
 after
 that.


So
 one
 year
 from
 now
 it's
 going
 to


reacelerate
 to
 53%.
 Nvidia
 on
 the
 other


hand
 and
 I'm
 not
 trying
 to
 discount


Nvidia
 like
 I
 think
 Nvidia
 is
 going
 to


go up
 if
 the
 market
 goes
 up.
 The
 most


recent
 quarter
 that
 Nvidia
 reported
 on


the
 mean
 or
 the
 average
 was
 66.2%


and
 then
 it's
 going
 to
 de
 decelerate
 to


54.9%
 a
 year
 from
 now.
 I
 think
 that


these
 actual
 EPS
 estimates
 in
 terms
 of


growth
 percentages
 do
 matter
 when
 you


think
 of
 valuation
 or
 what
 the
 premium


the
 market's
 going
 to
 give
 them
 because


decelerating
 EPS
 growth
 isn't


necessarily
 bearish
 for
 Nvidia
 being


like
 the
 quote
 unquote
 godfather
 of
 AI


the
 center
 of
 the
 the
 storm
 whatever
 it


is
 but
 I
 think
 that
 this
 is
 the
 reason


why
 Broadcom
 is
 commanding
 a
 much
 higher


valuation
 because
 analysts
 are
 very


bullish
 on
 its
 EPS
 growth.


I
 think
 that's
 fair
 and
 and
 and


realistically
 the
 story
 is
 that
 both


should
 do
 well
 if
 the
 AI
 thematic


continues
 to
 be
 what
 we
 think
 it
 is
 and


that's
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see


going
 into
 next
 year.
 Um
 all
 right,
 the


Fed,
 let's
 talk
 about
 it.
 We
 had
 JPAL


yesterday.
 He
 said
 a
 variety
 of
 things


that
 have
 been
 interpreted
 potentially


as
 more
 dovish
 than
 not.
 Chris,
 we'll


get
 to
 you
 and
 I
 guess
 how
 you're


thinking
 about
 the
 labor
 market,


inflation,
 quantitative
 tightening


ending
 and
 do
 you
 think
 this
 was
 the


most
 dovish
 pow
 that
 we
 could
 possibly


get?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 the
 one
 line


that
 uh
 that
 I
 really
 took
 to
 heart
 was


him
 saying,
 "I
 want
 to
 leave
 my


successor
 with
 a
 good
 economy."
 Right.


So
 I
 think
 to
 some
 degree
 he
 realizes


the
 economy
 is
 kind
 of
 stagnating
 a


little
 bit
 for
 the
 at
 at
 some
 at
 the


peripheries
 and
 so
 one
 of
 the
 things
 he


does
 not
 he
 doesn't
 want
 is
 the
 next
 guy


to
 say
 oh
 my
 god
 Jerome
 Pal
 broke


everything
 and
 basically
 I'm
 here
 to
 fix


it
 you
 know
 so
 I
 think
 right
 now


everything
 is
 getting
 to
 that
 that
 zone


so
 Jerome
 Powell
 wants
 his
 legacy
 to
 be


I
 crushed
 inflation
 and
 I
 gave
 the
 next


guy
 a
 a
 good
 economies
 to
 work
 with
 you


you
 know,
 and
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 where


we're
 going
 to
 go
 with
 this.
 So,


>> do
 do
 you
 think
 they're
 setting
 up
 for
 a


sign
 do
 you
 believe
 them
 that
 there
 was


only
 one
 cut
 next
 year
 that
 they're


guiding
 for
 or
 no
 way?


>> I
 think
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 more
 than


one
 cut,
 but
 but
 it's
 going
 to
 depend


like
 on
 on
 on
 inflation,
 right?
 I
 mean,


as
 far
 as
 I
 can
 tell,
 there's
 no
 way
 in


hell,
 even
 if
 you're
 a
 Trump
 loyalist


Fed
 Fed
 chair
 and
 if
 inflation
 starts
 to


go
 beyond
 the
 let's
 say
 the
 3.3
 3.4
 4


3.5
 dude
 you're
 gonna
 it's
 going
 to
 be


really
 really
 hard
 for
 you
 to
 maintain


credibility
 in
 which
 case
 the
 bond


market
 will
 will
 more
 than
 likely


respond
 in
 a
 really
 really
 negative
 way.


So
 if
 you
 become
 too
 bullish
 all
 of
 a


sudden
 on
 the
 cuts
 the
 market
 is
 going


to
 say
 well
 this
 is
 pretty
 much
 a
 signal


that
 inflation
 is
 going
 to
 come
 back


because
 the
 Fed
 like
 um
 you


[clears throat]
 know
 um
 un
 un
 like
 what


is
 that
 thing
 called?
 Um
 ease
 too


quickly
 basically.
 And
 right
 now
 we're


at
 neutral.
 I
 think
 right
 now
 if
 if
 the


Fed
 didn't
 do
 anything
 for
 the
 next
 6


months,
 I
 think
 if
 naturally
 inflation


is
 going
 to
 come
 down,
 especially
 if
 you


look
 at
 housing,
 which
 makes
 up
 about


36%


of
 the
 CPI
 number,
 that's
 decelerating.


And
 the
 decelerating
 in
 housing
 is
 not


stopping,
 right?
 So
 that's
 the
 one
 thing


that
 I
 would
 watch
 out
 for.
 Now,
 here's


the
 thing.
 there's
 core
 goods
 and


everything
 else
 where
 some
 of
 these


companies
 are
 going
 to
 definitely
 raise


their
 prices
 to
 make
 up
 for
 the
 tariffs


now
 that
 their
 inventories
 have
 to
 be


restocked
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 pass
 some


of
 those
 costs
 along
 to
 the
 consumer.


But
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 the
 consumer
 is


also
 getting
 hammered
 by
 by
 lack
 of


liquidity
 from
 the
 federal
 government,


right?
 If
 you
 go
 back
 the
 last
 three,


four
 years,
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 why
 we


had
 so
 much
 inflation
 is
 because
 you


sent
 out
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 stimulus


checks.
 You
 told
 people
 they
 didn't
 have


to
 pay
 their
 mortgage
 for
 like
 sometimes


like
 like
 three,
 four,
 four
 years.


There's
 so
 many
 people
 that
 were
 relying


on
 all
 these
 governments.
 You
 didn't


have
 to
 pay
 your
 student
 loans.
 Oh,
 you


don't
 have
 electricity?
 Don't
 worry


about
 it.
 Here's
 here's
 this
 food


stamps.
 Here
 you
 go,
 everyone.
 Get
 on


food
 stamps.
 The
 number
 of
 people
 that


got
 on
 food
 stamps
 during
 COVID


exploded.
 Now,
 what
 are
 you
 doing?


You're
 putting
 in
 work
 requirements
 for


health
 care.
 people
 are
 more
 than
 likely


going
 to
 have
 to
 pay
 additional
 amount


to
 get
 their
 get
 their
 um
 their
 Obama


their
 Obamacare
 um
 Obamacare
 um


coverage,
 you
 know,
 and
 same
 thing
 with


a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 businesses.
 They're


going
 to
 be
 paying
 more
 for
 insurance.


So,
 what
 does
 this
 mean?
 That
 means
 that


there's
 less
 money
 in
 people's
 pockets


to
 go
 out
 there
 and
 spend.
 So,
 even
 if
 a


business
 says,
 "Yeah,
 I'm
 going
 to
 raise


my
 prices
 20
 30%."
 if
 the
 consumer


doesn't
 have
 the
 money
 to
 spend
 it,


you're
 just
 going
 to
 destroy
 demand,
 you


know.
 So,
 I
 think
 right
 now
 the
 consumer


is
 being
 sort
 of
 constrained
 right
 now


in
 terms
 of
 what
 they
 can
 spend
 um
 going


forward
 and
 I
 think
 that
 impact
 is
 going


to
 severely
 limit
 inflation's
 uh
 upward


move
 above
 a
 3.5
 level.
 And
 then
 at
 the


same
 time,
 you've
 got
 shelter
 which
 is


coming
 down.
 Now,
 there
 is
 one
 X
 factor


that
 uh
 I
 think
 the
 Trump
 administration


is
 going
 to
 have
 to
 work
 on,
 which
 is


natural
 gas
 prices.
 Natural
 gas
 prices


have
 absolutely
 exploded
 because
 of
 data


center
 demand
 as
 well
 as
 a
 cold
 winter


for
 from
 us.
 And
 then
 all
 the
 LG
 um


exporters,
 they're
 they're
 putting
 a


 ton
 of
 demand
 on
 the
 on
 the
 levels.


So,
 the
 Trump
 administration
 is
 going
 to


have
 to
 work
 with
 the
 energy
 companies


to
 expand
 the
 amount
 of
 natural
 gas


that's
 being
 produced.
 And
 if
 we
 get


that,
 then
 you
 should
 see
 natural
 and


gas
 prices
 come
 down
 and
 electricity


prices
 kind
 of
 moderate.
 Well,
 the


growth
 in
 electricity
 prices
 moderating.


In
 which
 case,
 that's
 another
 another


big
 leg
 for
 um
 inflation
 to
 stay
 stay


where
 it
 is
 and
 actually
 come
 down
 a


little
 bit.
 I
 also
 think
 there's
 one


more
 factor
 that
 I've
 been
 like
 like


really
 really
 pushing
 for
 the
 last
 two


years.


It
 may
 sound
 counterintuitive,
 but
 by


lowering
 interest
 rates,
 you're
 actually


going
 to
 lower
 housing
 prices.
 I
 know
 it


sounds
 counterintuitive,
 right?
 Usually,


if
 you
 lower
 if
 you
 lower
 interest


rates,
 the
 price
 of
 assets
 like
 like


home
 should
 go
 up.
 Well,
 the
 thing
 is,


if
 you
 lower
 interest
 rates
 right
 now,


what
 you're
 also
 going
 to
 see
 is
 the


thawing
 of
 the
 housing
 market.
 there's


actually
 going
 to
 be
 more
 inventory
 that


actually
 comes
 on
 the
 market
 for
 for
 for


the
 first
 time
 in
 the
 last
 like
 three


four
 years
 where
 inventory
 levels
 are


finally
 starting
 to
 starting
 to
 get
 back


to
 their
 normal
 levels
 like
 they
 were


precoid.
 So
 if
 you
 think
 about
 the


number
 of
 the
 amount
 of
 inventory
 that's


coming
 online
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 parts
 of
 the


country,
 that
 should
 also
 help
 kind
 of


like
 like
 um
 moderate
 the
 the
 growth
 in


shelter
 prices
 because
 it's
 a
 commodity


that's
 you
 know
 that's
 you
 can't
 build
 a


lot.
 So
 it's
 not
 like
 super
 expandable.


And
 then
 of
 course
 you've
 got


deflationary
 headwinds
 coming
 from
 all


these
 deportations
 and
 next
 year
 they're


going
 to
 be
 supercharged
 even
 more.
 So


when
 you
 think
 about
 all
 the
 aggregate


demand
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 destroyed
 from


uh
 from
 all
 these
 deportations
 and
 the


lack
 of
 net
 migration,
 you're
 you're


going
 to
 be
 looking
 at
 a
 much
 slower


slower
 um
 growth
 in
 consumer
 spending,


you
 know,
 especially
 if
 you
 took
 it
 away


a
 lot
 of these
 liquidity
 supports.
 So


>> sorry
 to
 interrupt,
 but
 did
 Hawkan
 say


something
 in
 that
 call
 that's
 making
 a


bump?


Oh,


>> you're
 on
 mute.


I'm
 say
 he's
 probably
 saying
 something


that's
 getting
 the
 street
 excited,
 but


it's
 not
 holding
 like
 it's
 like
 you
 see


how
 it's
 going
 up
 and
 down
 between
 that


418
 to
 420
 range.


>> It's
 everywhere.
 But
 he
 said
 something.


He
 definitely
 said
 something
 is


reacting.


>> Yeah,
 I'll
 try
 to
 get
 some
 quotes
 in
 a


second.
 Uh
 Steve,
 your
 take
 on
 the
 Fed


>> and
 do
 you
 agree
 with
 Chris
 that,
 you


know,
 the
 Fed
 will
 continue
 to
 cut
 rates


because
 we
 need
 more
 liquidity?
 Well,


before
 I
 give
 you
 the
 take
 on
 the
 Fed,
 I


agree
 with
 Chris
 on
 housing
 prices,
 and


I
 think
 something
 that
 every
 a
 lot
 of


people
 need
 to
 realize
 is


the
 majority
 of
 housing
 prices
 right
 now


are
 not
 sustainable.
 They're
 just
 not.


If
 you
 look
 at
 you
 take
 Long
 Island
 for


instance,
 you
 do
 a
 Google
 search,


Sam's
 looking
 at
 me
 like
 I'm
 crazy.
 Just


>> dude,
 just
 wait
 for


>> I
 grew
 up
 in
 Long
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 Long


Island.
 All right,


>> wait
 for
 like
 th
 those
 housing
 prices


are
 not
 going
 down
 because
 no
 one
 wants


to
 leave
 Long
 Island.


>> They're
 already
 I'm
 checking
 specific


areas
 because
 I'm
 looking
 for
 something.


They're
 going
 down
 right
 now.
 Now,
 the


average


>> household
 income
 on
 Long
 Island
 is


$137,000.


It's
 higher
 than
 the
 national
 average,


but
 starter
 houses
 during
 this
 point


have
 reached
 $700
 $800,000.


starter
 houses.
 You're
 not
 able
 to


sustain
 that
 with
 a
 family.
 It's
 just


simple
 mathematics.
 You're
 not
 you're


not
 going
 to
 have
 the
 runway
 for
 it.
 And


you
 look
 at
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 towns
 on
 Long


Island,
 there's
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 inventory


on
 the
 market
 in
 these
 towns.
 And
 a
 lot


of
 people
 don't
 want
 to
 leave
 or
 get


into
 a
 new
 mortgage
 when
 they
 have


anywhere
 from
 2.8
 to
 3.2%.


So,
 as
 rates
 come
 down
 and
 more
 supply


hits
 the
 market,
 it's
 going
 to
 crush
 the


demand.
 And
 I
 do
 think
 we're
 going
 to


see
 prices
 come
 down
 on
 houses
 because


once
 again,
 trying
 to
 get
 into
 a


$700,000
 house
 when


household
 average
 income's
 137.


Extremely
 difficult
 when
 you
 think
 about


taxes
 have
 to
 be
 paid
 on
 that
 money
 and


other
 expenses.
 Now,
 as
 far
 as
 the
 Fed,


I
 I
 want
 to
 know
 what
 happened
 to
 JPAL.


I
 want
 to
 know
 who
 stole
 them.
 I
 want
 to


know
 what
 where
 the
 body
 double
 came


from.
 Guy
 was
 smiling
 and
 the
 numbers


they
 said
 out
 of
 there.


So


1.7%
 real
 GDP
 growth.
 2026
 they're


expecting
 2.3%.


2%
 in
 27
 1.9%
 in
 28.
 That
 basically


means
 they're
 not
 seeing
 a
 recession
 at


any
 point.
 I
 mean
 that's
 pretty
 big


coming
 out
 of
 the
 Fed.
 a
 Fed
 that's
 been


overly
 hawkish
 and
 now
 they're
 seeing


unemployment
 starting
 to
 come
 down
 where


they're
 saying
 they
 think
 it's
 going
 to


go
 to
 4.5%
 and
 then
 ease
 to
 4.4
 again
 in


26
 and
 4.2%
 in
 2027.


And
 now
 inflation's
 not
 even
 a
 problem


anymore
 according
 to
 them
 because


they're
 seeing
 the
 medium
 projection
 at


2.9%
 for
 this
 year
 for
 headline
 and
 then


going
 down
 to
 2.4
 4
 and
 26
 and
 2.1
 and


27.
 And
 that
 goes
 for
 core
 also,
 which


is
 their
 preferred
 indicator.
 So,


I
 got
 to
 tell
 you,
 I
 agree
 with
 what
 Sam


said
 about
 20
 minutes
 ago.
 I
 agree
 with


what
 Chris
 said.
 This
 is
 a
 great
 setup


for
 the
 market.
 And
 if
 we
 get


unemployment
 coming
 down
 in
 addition
 to


the
 GDP
 growth
 and
 lower
 inflation,
 you


watch
 this
 market
 rip
 next
 year.
 And


I'll
 say
 it
 right
 now,
 Tom
 Lee's
 7,700


number
 is
 low.
 If
 this
 is
 the
 setup,


>> what's
 your
 target?
 85
 89.
 I
 mean,
 I'm


scared
 to
 ask.
 You're


>> I'm
 going
 to
 say
 it,
 but
 I'm
 going
 to


say
 it
 with
 a
 air
 quote
 that
 this
 could


be
 revised
 on
 the
 31st
 when
 I
 make
 my


actual
 prediction,
 but
 I'm
 going
 to
 say


if
 we
 don't
 get
 a
 recession,
 and
 this
 is


the
 actual
 setup,
 we're
 hitting
 8,000


next
 year.


Speaking
 of
 not
 ripping,
 uh,
 Hawkan


definitely
 said
 something
 on
 the
 call


that
 was
 not
 good
 because
 they
 just


reversed
 almost
 all
 of
 their
 gains.


>> Really?


>> What
 did
 he
 say?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I'm
 trying
 to
 look
 at
 the,


uh,
 live
 transcript
 here.


>> Well,
 hold
 on.
 The
 first
 thing
 that
 he


said
 that
 that
 got
 them
 the
 gains
 was


this
 right
 here
 that
 they
 got
 an


additional
 10
 billion
 order


>> for
 uh,
 Ironwood
 TPU
 racks.
 He
 said,
 but


that
 does
 not
 mean
 our
 other
 two


customers
 are
 using
 TPUs.
 In
 fact,
 they


prefer
 to
 control
 their
 own
 destiny
 by


continuing
 to
 drive
 their
 own
 journey
 in


AI
 accelerators.


>> I
 guess
 he
 said
 something
 else.


>> Oh,
 Google's
 dropping.


>> We
 We
 cannot
 have
 a
 back-to-back
 days
 of


Oracle
 and
 Broadcom.


We
 just
 We
 don't
 need
 that
 right
 now.
 We


don't
 need
 that.


>> Take
 a
 look
 at
 this
 thing.
 So,
 right


here,
 home
 prices
 go
 negative
 for
 the


first
 time
 in
 over
 two
 years.
 May
 stay


that
 way
 for
 a
 while.
 I
 think
 this
 is


from
 the
 N.


A
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 pulling
 their
 homes


off
 the
 market
 and
 they're
 probably


going
 to
 list
 them
 again
 in
 the


springtime


right
 here.


Yeah.
 So,
 I
 was
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 the
 the


cities
 that
 are
 going
 to
 be
 impacted
 the


most
 by
 home
 prices
 coming
 down.
 You're


starting
 to
 actually
 see
 prices
 in


California
 coming
 down.
 Uh
 Texas,


they're
 coming
 down.
 Florida,
 they're


coming
 down
 for
 sure.
 Georgia,
 we've
 we


flatlined
 and
 starting
 to
 come
 down
 a


little
 bit.
 But
 once
 again,
 all
 of
 this


data
 is
 lagging,
 right?
 eventually
 that


data
 is
 going
 to
 come
 into
 the
 CPI


number.
 So
 we
 have
 to
 think
 ahead
 of


time
 be
 like
 look
 if
 shelter
 is
 almost


36%
 of
 the
 component
 and
 and
 at
 the
 same


time
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 current
 PCE
 and


it's
 like
 well
 shelter
 is
 growing
 by


3.6%.


In
 what
 world
 do
 you
 think
 shelter
 is


growing
 at
 3.6%.
 You're
 looking
 at
 data


in
 in
 backwards
 land
 like
 why
 can't
 you


do
 a
 forward
 calculation
 right
 now
 and


see
 that?
 So,
 I
 think
 that's
 where
 the


disconnect
 is
 at
 the
 Fed.
 If
 they
 were


to
 actually
 look
 at
 forward,
 I
 think


that
 they
 would
 actually
 do
 maybe


Stephen
 Moran
 was
 right.
 Maybe
 they


should
 have
 done
 a
 50,
 you
 know?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 would
 have
 loved
 for
 them
 to


do
 a
 50.
 Sam,
 what
 are
 you
 are
 you
 still


familiar
 with
 Long
 Island?


>> No,
 I
 am.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 Suffach


County,
 so
 the
 prices
 just
 keep
 going


up.
 Um,


>> so
 you
 know
 where
 Hicksville
 is,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 No,
 that's
 more
 That's
 Is
 that


Nassau
 or
 Suffach?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 Nassau.
 It's
 more
 central


Long
 Island.
 It's
 a
 very
 heavily


populated
 area.


>> Now,
 was
 never
 like


>> the
 place
 to
 be
 in
 Long
 Island,


>> but
 that's
 why
 I'm
 using
 as
 an
 example.


>> Wait,
 wait,
 don't
 they
 won't
 they
 don't


they
 make
 iced
 tea
 in
 Long
 Island?


>> Long
 Island
 iced
 tea
 is
 a
 Yes,


>> I
 knew
 it.
 I
 knew
 it.


>> So,
 you
 my
 stream,


what
 did
 you
 do?
 You
 lose
 you
 used
 too


many
 Burger
 King
 coupons.


Nvidia
 selling
 off
 something
 he
 said


getting
 us
 down.


>> So
 So
 Sam,
 the
 admit
 bring
 up
 my
 screen


for
 one
 second.
 Like
 what
 I'm
 about
 to


show
 is
 just
 not
 sustainable.
 800
 grand


for
 a
 1300
 foot
 house
 in
 Hicksville.


>> Well,
 okay.
 So
 home
 prices


>> are
 very
 reliant
 on
 school
 districts
 and


Long
 Island
 has


>> Well,
 I
 know
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 you're


you're
 picking
 like
 an
 outlier
 here,


right?
 So


>> I
 could
 I
 could
 go
 to
 Levittown
 or


others.
 I'm
 I'm
 just
 saying.


>> Well,
 you're
 going to
 Levittown.
 You're


going
 to
 southern
 Long
 Island.
 Of


course.
 Like
 I'm
 not
 Okay.
 I
 do.


>> Long
 Island.
 So
 So
 go
 ahead
 and
 pick


pick
 plane
 View.
 Okay.
 Pick
 pick
 Dicks


Hills.
 P
 pick
 maybe
 not
 Comarmac,
 but


yeah,
 pick
 Old
 Beth
 Page.
 Pick
 Pick


those
 areas.
 Those
 homes
 are
 very
 I
 was


actually
 just
 looking
 over
 there
 because


we
 were
 like,
 "Okay,
 let's
 think
 about


moving
 there,
 but
 it's
 not
 going
 to


happen."
 But
 those
 school
 districts
 are


like
 10
 out
 of
 10
 over
 there.
 Those


homes
 have
 premium
 value
 almost
 all
 the


time.


>> Someone
 saying
 that
 [laughter]
 this
 is


not
 sustainable,


>> bro.
 How
 is
 that
 worth
 $745?


>> And
 the
 school
 and
 look,
 Long
 Island


school
 districts
 are
 good.
 This
 is
 not


sustainable
 because
 what
 you
 need
 to
 do


>> look
 at
 the
 property
 taxes
 on
 that


thing.
 Look
 at
 the
 property
 taxes
 on


that
 thing.


>> Welcome
 to
 New
 York,
 baby.


>> It's
 like
 $15,000
 for
 a
 prop
 for


property
 taxes
 on
 top
 of
 what
 on
 top
 of


that.
 Yeah,
 it's
 12
 grand.
 I
 mean,
 yeah.


The
 but
 the
 reality
 is
 that
 at
 137,000


average
 household
 income,
 these
 prices


are
 not
 affordable.
 And
 Beth
 Page,


Hicksville,
 and
 Levittown
 are
 not
 even


the
 upper
 areas.
 I'm
 just
 saying
 that


Long
 Island
 prices
 are
 not
 sustainable.


You're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 crack
 in
 housing.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to


crack
 where
 it
 actually
 matters,
 but
 I
 I


don't
 know
 about
 Long
 Island.
 All
 right.


I
 live
 in
 LA
 still,
 right?
 there's
 no


more
 real
 estate
 left.
 They
 only
 have
 to


build
 up,
 not
 horizontal.
 Right?
 So,
 in


my
 opinion,
 I
 don't
 think
 these


metropolitan
 areas
 are
 going
 to


necessarily
 go
 down.
 Like,
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 very
 it's
 very
 difficult
 to
 think


that
 New
 York
 City
 real
 estate
 is
 going


to
 go
 down
 just
 as
 much
 because
 like


they
 clearly
 cannot
 build
 anywhere
 else.


But
 if
 you
 think
 of
 these
 residential


communities
 where
 people
 are
 looking


over
 there,
 they're
 like,
 "Oh,
 the


school
 districts
 are
 good,
 but
 maybe


there's
 more
 funding
 here
 in
 these
 other


school
 districts
 that
 are
 like
 in
 uh
 up


north
 in
 Long
 Island."
 Okay?
 So
 if
 you


go
 to
 like
 maybe
 uh
 maybe
 Westchester
 or


York
 Yorktown
 high
 Yorktownville,
 I


forget
 the
 exact
 name
 of
 that
 area,


those
 schools
 pretty
 good.
 Even
 like


Long
 Island,
 Amit,
 shout
 out
 to
 Amit.


Long
 I'm
 sorry,
 New
 Jersey.
 Shout
 out
 to


Amit,
 New
 Jersey,
 right?
 Like
 there's


people
 moving
 out
 there
 and
 the
 school


districts
 are
 going
 to
 keep
 getting


better
 as
 long
 as
 the
 funding
 continues


to
 come
 in.
 Like
 that
 would
 make
 sense


for
 that
 to
 happen.
 But
 I
 do
 agree
 in


that
 sense
 what
 you're
 talking
 about


Steve
 and
 Chris
 is
 that
 when
 these
 rates


do
 come
 down,
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 a


flood
 of
 inventory
 coming
 back
 to
 the


market.
 People
 be
 like,
 "Oh,
 I
 want
 to


move
 over
 here
 now.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 live


here
 anymore.
 Now
 I
 could
 sell
 my
 house


because
 there's
 buyers
 in
 the
 market
 now


because
 there's
 no
 buyers
 in
 the
 market


right
 now.
 There
 are
 no
 buyers
 at
 all.


In
 fact,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 houses
 I
 live
 in


um
 I
 live
 in
 the
 valley
 in
 LA
 and
 it's


very
 high
 demand
 over
 here,
 but
 there's


very
 little
 inventory
 over
 here.
 And
 the


people
 who
 are
 trying
 to
 sell
 their


houses
 right
 now
 are
 selling
 it
 for


ridiculous
 amounts
 because
 they
 think


they
 can,
 right?
 But
 when
 these
 rates


come
 down,
 your
 $6,000
 a
 month
 mortgage


payment
 becomes
 5,000
 and
 becomes
 a
 bit


more
 affordable.
 Not
 extremely


affordable,
 a
 little
 bit
 more


affordable.


>> Guys,
 is
 giving
 us
 your
 2%
 hit
 right


now.


>> God
 damn
 it,


>> what
 did
 Hawkan
 say?
 What
 did


>> clipping
 too
 many
 Burger
 King
 coupons


lately?


>> I'm
 looking
 at
 the
 transcript.
 I
 can't


find
 anything
 specific.
 If
 anyone
 in
 the


chat
 has
 a
 quote,
 let
 me
 know.
 But


something
 because
 that's
 a
 6%
 four
 5.3%


reversal.
 And
 if
 it
 goes
 further,
 this


is
 going
 to
 be
 almost
 a
 7%
 reversal
 that


we're
 seeing,


which
 is
 not
 crazy.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 down
 2%


whatever,
 but
 it
 was
 up
 5%,
 which
 is
 why


the
 streets
 up.
 So,
 for
 everyone
 asking


what's
 going
 on,
 it's
 because
 Broadcom.


That's
 why
 everything
 else
 is
 going


down.


>> You
 can't
 take
 earnings
 too
 seriously,


man.
 Uh
 earnings
 is
 more
 about
 a


sentiment
 shift
 up
 or
 down
 rather
 than


actually
 fundamentals.
 Like
 you
 know
 if


you
 present
 something
 in
 the
 wrong
 way


you
 could
 go
 down.
 I
 mean
 dude
 you
 know


how
 many
 times
 Elon
 you'll
 have
 the


shittiest
 earnings
 be
 like
 they
 lost


over
 a
 billion
 dollars.
 They've
 missed


earnings
 by
 this
 and
 he
 just
 comes
 out


and
 says
 robots.
 That's
 great.
 We're


going
 to
 Mars
 with
 robots
 and
 boom
 the


stock
 goes.


>> Oh
 man
 freaking
 Hawk
 Tan's
 going
 to


all
 over
 us
 tomorrow.


Wait,
 hold
 on.
 We
 We
 got
 to
 figure
 out


why.
 3.99.
 What?
 The
 street
 was
 excited


for
 the
 past
 30
 minutes
 and
 now
 they're


not.


>> So,


>> I'm
 I'm
 trying
 to
 look
 at
 the
 transcript


here.
 I
 can't
 find
 it.
 Wall
 Street


Engine
 usually
 posts
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 on


time
 there.


>> And
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 nothing
 in
 the


Q&A.
 It
 has
 to
 be
 something
 else
 because


it's
 already
 reacted.


>> Maybe
 this
 is
 actually
 bullish
 for


Nvidia.
 Maybe
 this
 is
 bullish
 for


Nvidia.
 Who
 knows?
 Maybe
 he
 said,
 "Uh,


you
 know
 what?
 Maybe
 our
 TPUs
 are
 just


not
 as
 good
 as
 Nvidia's
 GPUs.
 What
 if
 he


said
 that?


>> That's
 that's
 fair.
 I
 mean,


>> all
 right,
 Chris,
 get
 out
 of
 here.
 If


the
 market
 is
 going
 down,
 I
 don't
 care


if
 Nvidia
 goes
 up.
 If
 the
 whole
 market


is
 going
 down,
 Nvidia
 is
 going
 to
 go.
 In


fact,
 Nvidia
 is
 actually
 down
 60
 basis


points
 right
 now.
 So,
 if
 you
 if
 if
 we
 go


down,
 you
 go
 down.
 The
 best
 thing,
 the


best
 thing
 about
 Chris
 being
 bullish
 on


a
 name
 is
 that
 this
 guy
 when
 he
 gets


bullish,
 he
 will
 defend
 his
 name
 till


the
 end
 of
 time.
 And
 he'll
 start
 to


convince
 you
 and
 he
 will
 start
 to
 poo


poo
 against
 the
 competitors.
 And
 so
 now


we
 have
 him
 on
 the
 bullish
 side,
 not


just


>> but
 it
 worked.
 But
 look,
 I
 was
 super


bullish
 on
 Google.
 Y'all
 miss
 Google


except
 me
 and
 Steve
 right
 now.


>> Thank
 you.


>> No,
 that's
 my
 point.
 when
 when
 you
 get


so
 bullish
 on
 something
 uh
 you
 defend
 it


heavily.
 So
 now
 you're
 not
 just
 bullish


on
 Nvidia,
 you
 are
 bullish
 on
 AI
 because


Nvidia
 is
 AI.


>> And
 the
 fun
 part
 is
 Chris
 is
 as
 long
 as


he's
 in
 these
 Nvidia
 leaps
 going
 to
 be


defending
 AI
 with
 his
 heart
 and
 soul


which
 I


>> I
 have
 to
 No.
 [laughter]


>> Wait,
 Avio's
 back
 up.


>> Dude,
 what
 is
 this?
 399
 to
 405.


>> I
 told
 you
 you
 can't
 take
 these
 earnings


seriously,
 dude.
 Two
 syllables
 here,
 two


syllables
 there,
 and
 this
 thing
 goes
 in


one
 direction,
 goes
 in
 the
 other.
 Oh,


Jesus.


This
 is
 like
 we're
 at
 the
 We're
 at
 the


what
 is
 it
 called?
 The
 the
 horse
 horse


track,
 right?
 And
 you
 can
 see
 like
 your


horse
 winning
 and
 then
 it's
 pulling
 back


and
 then
 it's
 going
 up
 again.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 almost
 exactly
 what
 it
 is.


>> Yeah.
 By
 the
 way,
 the
 1%
 is
 not
 dumping.


Let's
 just
 get
 that
 out
 of
 the
 way.


>> Agreed.
 I
 mean,
 if
 this
 was
 serious,


you'd
 have
 like
 five
 10%
 dip.
 I
 mean,


look
 at
 what
 happened
 to
 Oracle.
 Oracle


got
 got


>> Oracle
 deserved
 to
 go
 down
 so
 much
 more


than
 it
 did.


>> Yeah.
 The
 valuation
 on
 Oracle
 after


their
 RPO


>> announce


this
 is
 horrible.


>> The
 Oracle
 the
 Oracle
 valuation
 made
 no


sense
 just
 because
 they
 had
 all
 this
 RPO


and
 they
 were
 financing.


Dude,
 I
 don't
 know
 what's
 going
 on
 with


Ellison.
 both


>> losing
 their
 minds.


>> Well,


>> do
 they
 know
 something
 we
 don't?


>> Larry
 lost
 50
 billion
 today.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 he
 can
 backs
 stop
 the
 Warner


Brothers
 acquisition
 as
 easily
 anymore.


>> He
 lost
 $50
 million
 in
 a
 day.
 Like,


>> I
 mean,
 the
 fact
 that
 they
 have


a
 net
 liquidity
 position
 of
 negative
 80


billion
 and
 they
 can't
 produce
 a
 dollar


in
 free
 cash
 flow,
 I
 don't
 give
 a


about
 their
 earnings.
 Bad
 news
 for


everybody.
 like
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be,


mark
 my
 words,
 Oracle
 will
 be
 dead
 money


for
 a
 while.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 long,
 but


it's
 going
 to
 be
 dead
 money
 for
 a
 while


now.
 It
 is
 a
 cockroach
 of
 a
 company.


It's
 always
 going
 to
 be
 there
 and
 it's


going
 to
 perform
 very
 well
 in
 the


future.
 It's
 going
 to
 take
 a
 while
 to


get
 to
 that
 area
 where
 all
 these


contracts
 come
 through
 and


mean
 a
 minute
 and
 I
 will
 go
 over
 it


later
 tonight,
 but
 this
 is
 going
 to


trade
 rangebound
 for
 a
 while.
 I
 wouldn't


be
 surprised
 if
 this
 goes
 125.


Dude,
 Larry
 Ellison's
 net
 worth
 is
 250


billion.
 I'm
 sure
 he's
 fine.


>> No,
 but
 I'm
 just
 saying
 like
 if
 if
 if


Netflix
 is
 like,
 "Look
 at
 how
 volatile


Oracle
 stock
 is.
 What
 if
 it
 goes
 down


another
 30
 bucks?"
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 a


convincing
 argument
 to
 Warner
 Brothers


to
 be
 like,
 "Yeah,
 you
 know,
 you're


telling
 us
 Larry's
 going
 to
 backs
 stop


the
 whole
 acquisition,
 but
 if
 his
 stock


goes
 down,
 you
 know,
 he'll
 probably


>> Well,
 here's
 the
 thing.
 You're
 running


into
 two
 different
 things.
 On
 one
 hand,


the
 Netflix
 you
 might
 not
 get
 past


antirust.


>> Oh,
 you're
 it's
 not
 ne
 There's
 no
 way


they're
 going to
 let
 Netflix
 and


freaking
 Warner
 emerge,


>> right?
 So
 now
 you're
 turning
 down
 a


higher
 bid
 and
 antirust
 risk.


Real
 quick
 before
 we
 continue,
 so


Broadcom
 said
 in
 Q1
 we
 forecast
 noni


semiconductor
 revenue
 to
 be
 4.1
 billion,


which
 is
 flat,
 not
 growing,
 down


sequentially
 due
 to
 wireless


seasonality.
 Why
 does
 this
 matter?
 This


is
 non
 AI.
 It's
 not
 even


>> I
 mean
 it's
 still
 a
 core
 part
 of
 their


business.
 That's
 why
 I
 mean
 but
 this


again
 shows
 by
 the
 way
 this
 is
 actually


something
 relevant.
 A
 lot
 of
 the
 5G
 um


installing


off.


>> Sorry
 Chris.
 Now
 we're
 legit
 getting


some
 pain
 down
 three
 and
 a
 half%.
 Go


ahead
 Chris.


>> The
 5G
 investing
 cycle
 like
 the
 capex


cycle
 is
 finally
 starting
 to
 catch
 up


now.
 So
 now
 they're
 the
 amount
 of
 capex


you're
 going
 from
 investing
 capex
 in
 5G


to
 maintenance
 capex
 in
 5G.
 So
 that


could
 be
 a
 business
 line
 that's
 hurting


them
 a
 little
 bit.
 So
 So
 you
 think
 even


though
 it's
 not
 AI
 oriented
 because
 it's


a
 core
 part
 of
 the
 business,
 the
 street


still
 isn't
 happy
 to
 see
 that
 one
 be


flat?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 pull
 up
 their
 investor


deck.
 I
 mean,
 wouldn't
 that
 be
 the
 place


to
 look?


>> I
 mean,
 how
 about
 it's
 also
 dumping


because
 Broadcom's
 overvalued?
 Just


>> that's
 true,
 too.
 I
 just
 showed
 it
 the


EV
 to
 EV.


>> You
 look
 at
 them
 versus
 Meta.
 Give
 me
 a


break.
 You're
 telling
 me
 you'd
 rather


buy
 Broadcom
 the
 Meta
 here.
 Stop
 it.


>> Look
 at
 the
 EV
 to
 EBIA
 compared
 to


compared
 to
 Nvidia
 and
 look
 at
 the


growth
 rate
 here.
 Just
 pull
 this
 up
 real


quick.
 This
 includes
 November.
 Dude,
 I


love
 fiscal
 AI.
 They
 get
 these
 numbers


out
 fast
 somehow.
 But
 their
 revenue


growth
 went
 from
 44%
 to
 now
 20
 24%.


Top
 line,
 right?
 And
 then
 at
 the
 same


time,
 so
 why
 would
 you
 be
 giving
 it
 a


higher
 EV
 to
 EBIDA
 than
 than
 Nvidia?


>> And
 keep
 in
 mind,
 Broadcom
 was
 a
 $2


billion
 company
 going
 into
 this
 print.


Two
 billion.
 I'm
 sorry.
 Two
 trillion.


>> Two
 trillion.
 Two
 trillion.


>> Two
 trillion
 dollar
 company
 going
 into


this
 print.
 And
 going
 into
 the
 print,


their
 free
 cash
 flow
 was
 25
 billion.


Like
 that's
 not
 I
 mean,
 come
 on.


>> It's
 insane.
 When
 Meta
 was
 a
 1.5.6
 $6


trillion
 company
 and
 their
 profitability


is
 off
 the
 charts
 compared
 to
 that.


>> Well,
 it's
 not
 a
 big
 deal.
 It's
 trading


exactly
 where
 it
 was
 this
 morning.
 So,


it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 Um


>> I
 mean,
 no.
 Well,
 if
 someone
 for
 those


who
 have
 weekly
 options,
 it
 is
 a
 big


deal.
 They're
 going
 to
 get
 crushed


tomorrow.


>> It's
 a
 big
 It's
 a
 big
 deal
 for
 me.
 Um


[laughter]


>> you
 you
 have
 weekly
 options
 on
 this.


>> You
 have
 a
 month.


>> I
 told
 you
 I
 I
 Well,
 next
 month.
 Yeah.


But
 I
 don't
 know.
 It
 is
 different
 than
 I


told
 you.
 I
 told
 you
 it's
 small
 size
 so


it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 But
 oh
 well
 that's


what
 happens
 with
 gamble
 earnings.


>> It
 could
 it
 could
 recover
 in
 a
 minute


you


>> next
 month
 you
 could
 be
 you
 should
 be


fine
 but
 I
 mean
 weeklys


>> gez
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be


>> and
 I
 don't
 even
 have
 calls
 I
 I've


spread
 so
 I
 don't
 know
 I'm
 not
 I
 this
 is


the
 total
 degen
 position.
 So
 degenerate


should
 get
 degenerate
 smacked.
 Um
 it
 is


what
 it
 is.
 But
 uh
 I
 don't
 want
 Chris


Patel
 to
 win
 or
 or
 the
 milkman
 to
 win


this
 argument.
 I
 want
 it
 to
 be
 very


green
 tomorrow.
 So
 that
 way
 I
 don't
 want


to
 hear
 this
 garbage
 that


Broadcom
 is
 overvalued.
 I
 don't
 care


what
 the
 valuation
 is.
 I
 want
 it
 to
 be


up
 tomorrow.


>> Sam
 Sam,
 you
 think
 it's
 under
 you
 think


Broadcom
 is
 undervalued?


>> No.
 No.


>> What
 do
 you
 So
 what's
 your


>> If
 it's
 undervalued,
 that
 doesn't
 mean


it's
 overvalued,
 right?
 This
 isn't
 a


binary
 question.


>> You
 think
 the
 fair
 intrinsic
 value?
 I
 I


think
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 above
 fair


value,
 but
 I
 think
 the
 market
 moves
 off


momentum
 in
 the
 very
 short
 term.
 And


well,
 I
 mean,
 hey,
 the
 thing
 was
 up


like%
 after
 ours.


>> I
 don't
 know
 if
 the
 market
 is
 going
 to


give
 a
 momentum
 argument
 to
 a
 stock


that's
 up
 80%
 this
 year.


>> Well,
 not
 anymore.
 [laughter]
 Not


anymore.
 We
 were
 singing
 a
 different


tune
 like
 five
 minutes
 ago.
 Not
 so
 much


anymore,
 but
 Hawken
 had
 to
 go
 uh
 Burger


King
 coupons
 on
 us.
 And
 uh
 now
 I'm
 going


to
 be
 eating
 Burger
 King
 tonight,
 not


sushi.


Yeah,
 like
 I
 agree
 with
 your
 momentum


argument,
 but
 when
 momentum
 when
 the


stock
 like
 Hood,
 right,
 a
 lot
 of
 people,


well,
 momentum,
 but
 Hood's
 up
 200%
 this


year,
 so
 we
 can't
 expect
 it
 to
 keep


going
 just
 off
 momentum.
 It
 has
 to
 do


something
 that
 the
 market
 didn't
 expect


like
 that
 prediction
 markets
 acquisition


that
 it
 moved
 up
 10%
 the
 next
 day.
 The


market
 didn't
 expect
 that
 for
 Broadcom.


These
 are
 good
 earnings,
 but
 I
 mean
 it's


not
 like


>> oh
 my
 goodness,


>> forward
 the
 guidance
 was
 bad.
 So


forwardlooking,
 it
 doesn't
 care
 anymore


at
 that
 point.
 No,
 momentum
 is
 a
 real


thing.
 I
 mean
 look
 at the
 Amcor
 chart


the
 ENS
 chart
 on
 semiconductor


>> but
 amore
 doesn't
 have
 a
 mult
 that's
 the


difference


>> it's
 still
 cheap
 yeah
 that's
 still
 cheap


I
 mean
 that
 that's
 where
 the
 crux
 of


portfolio
 is
 in
 very
 in
 position
 well
 I


guess
 not
 so
 much
 cheap
 anymore
 but
 like


companies
 that
 are
 still
 have
 the


asymmetric
 upside
 but
 you
 know


degenerates
 got
 to
 scratch
 that


degenerate
 itch
 uh
 I
 think
 we
 all
 have


it
 but
 some
 of
 us
 are
 tame
 with
 it
 I'm


clearly
 not
 tame
 with
 it
 u
 but
 we'll
 see


what
 happens
 tomorrow


>> Chris
 the
 in
 the
 back.
 Yeah,
 I'm
 going


to
 go
 to
 I
 got
 to
 go
 to
 McDonald's
 and


uh
 apply
 for
 a
 job
 right
 now.


>> Sam's
 probably
 down
 like
 $1,000
 on
 this


trade
 and
 he's
 like


>> it's
 it's
 not
 a
 lot.
 It's
 not
 It's
 not


even


>> Sam
 does
 small
 calculated
 bets
 that
 are


asymmetric.
 Okay.
 Like
 he
 doesn't


>> Yeah.


>> Me
 is
 where
 you
 got
 to
 look
 for
 DGEN


stuff.
 Like
 I
 risk
 I
 risk
 a
 lot
 more.
 So


that's
 why
 I
 have
 to
 do
 a
 lot
 more


research.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 one


thing
 I've
 I've
 been
 learning
 from
 that


uh
 stock
 talks
 guy.
 If
 you
 have
 real


conviction,
 then
 you
 don't
 mind
 going


heavy
 in
 a
 position
 like
 and
 I
 think


that's
 the
 thing,
 right?
 So
 depending
 on


how
 how
 bullish
 you
 are
 is
 how
 you
 how


you
 should
 allocate
 towards
 the


position.
 So
 Broadcom
 says
 we
 have
 73


billion
 of
 backlog
 for
 AI
 data
 centers


over
 the
 next
 18
 months.
 And
 obviously


this


>> that's
 not
 what
 it
 was.
 That's
 not
 what


it
 was.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 it's
 the
 non
 AI
 revenue
 is


what
 got


>> Yeah.
 The
 flat
 revenue
 growth
 for


semiconductor
 which
 is
 their
 I
 think


it's
 like
 above
 like
 60
 70%
 of
 its


revenue
 decelerating
 deceleration
 is


never
 a
 good
 thing.


>> This
 thing
 was
 $150


in
 April.
 Now
 it's
 $400.


>> That
 is
 the
 only
 reason
 I
 didn't
 take
 an


earnings
 trade
 today
 because
 I
 just


looked
 at
 the
 chart
 and
 I
 was
 like
 it's


up
 a
 lot.
 I
 mean
 like
 at
 some
 point


maybe
 it
 pumps
 but
 the
 risk
 is
 higher


than
 the
 reward.


>> I
 mean
 think
 about
 this.
 If
 Palanteer


and
 Nvidia
 couldn't
 get
 to
 all-time


highs
 after
 earnings
 be
 really
 hard
 for


Broadcom
 to
 keep
 going
 up.
 I
 mean


Nvidia's
 slaughtered
 and
 basically
 put


out
 a
 ridiculous
 number
 for
 Q4.


Palanteer
 is
 probably
 the
 second
 best


quarter
 I've
 ever
 seen
 out
 of
 a
 company.


And
 neither
 of
 those
 companies
 kept


going
 higher.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 But
 this
 is
 not
 what
 you
 want
 to


see
 after
 hours
 for
 the
 AI
 theme


decelerating
 semiconnected
 revenue.


>> That's
 not
 true
 at
 all.


>> That's
 not
 true.


>> This
 does
 not
 matter
 for
 AI
 one
 bit.


>> Yeah.


>> One
 short
 term
 guys.
 I
 love
 it.


>> I'm
 talking
 about
 the
 short
 term.
 I'm


talking
 about
 like
 weeks
 out


Amazon,
 Microsoft,
 and
 Alphabet
 and


Meta.


>> No,
 but
 we're
 talking
 about
 completely


different
 time
 frames
 right
 now.
 Like


you're
 talking
 about
 long
 term.
 You
 said


that
 this
 is
 bad
 for
 the
 AI
 theme.
 This


does
 not
 matter
 for
 the
 AI
 theme.


>> Okay.
 I
 apologize
 if I
 said
 AI
 theme.
 I


meant
 like
 for
 the
 AI
 trade


>> trade.
 I
 agree
 with
 you.


>> Right.
 So
 that
 that's
 what
 I
 that's
 what


I
 meant
 because
 like
 clearly
 we
 had


yesterday


>> we
 had
 yesterday
 Oracle
 dumping
 the
 bed


with
 their
 whatever
 they
 said
 in
 the


earnings
 call
 or
 whatever
 they
 didn't


say
 in
 an
 earnings
 call
 from
 what
 I've


what
 I've
 heard.
 And
 then
 now
 we
 have
 I


I
 got
 to
 look
 into
 the
 transcript


tonight
 and
 see
 what
 exactly
 he
 said


that
 brought
 it
 down.
 what
 appears
 like


what
 appears
 like
 it
 was
 probably
 bad


guidance
 for
 next
 year
 for
 semiconductor


revenue
 which
 affects
 pretty
 much
 the


TPUs
 and
 all
 that
 stuff
 right
 that's


going
 to
 affect
 the
 near
 term
 right
 so


you
 had
 Oracle
 basically
 dumped
 a
 bed


and
 that
 dumped
 it
 overnight
 and
 we
 come


back
 here
 closing
 on
 alltime
 highs
 like


the
 short
 term
 this
 is
 what


>> I'm
 sorry
 the
 short
 term
 this
 matters
 a


sentiment
 positioning
 matters
 in
 the


short
 term
 but
 the
 long-term
 perspective


hey


>> it's
 all
 cake
 right
 but
 for
 me
 for
 these


crazy
 degener
 plays
 that
 short
 term


matters
 for
 me.
 And
 the
 short
 term


matters
 when
 you
 know
 you're
 you're


putting
 a
 couple
 thousand
 dollars
 on
 the


line
 and
 maybe
 it
 doesn't
 work
 in
 your


favor.
 It
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 But
 like
 that's


been
 working
 for
 a
 while
 and
 you
 know


you
 take
 some
 hits,
 take
 some
 losses,


whatever
 it
 is.
 But
 for
 the
 long-term


perspective,
 you
 know,
 with
 this
 entire


AI
 theme,
 the
 onshoring,
 the
 fact
 that


we
 have
 multiple
 models
 coming
 out,
 GPT


5.2
 came
 out,
 which
 is
 the
 uh
 the


smartest
 model
 in
 the
 world,
 which
 I


don't
 know
 if
 that's
 really
 the
 case.
 We


have
 Gemini
 really
 coming
 back
 as
 far
 as


being
 the
 best
 model
 in
 2025.
 We
 have


building
 data
 centers
 in
 outer
 space.
 I


don't
 know if
 they're
 actually
 going
 to


do
 that,
 but
 if
 they
 do,
 well,
 you
 need


more
 chips,
 right?
 You
 need
 more
 data


center
 stuff,
 right?
 So,
 that's
 still


there.
 I'm
 just
 talking
 about
 like


specific
 short-term
 trades,
 which
 I
 know


a
 lot
 of
 people
 in
 the
 chat
 probably
 do,


right?
 You
 do
 short-term
 trades.
 These


things
 matter.
 These
 things
 matter
 and


it
 the
 positioning
 and
 the
 sentiment
 for


it.
 Dude,
 Elon's
 definitely
 gonna
 pump


the
 data
 centers
 in
 space
 theme
 because


if
 he's
 going
 to
 get
 IPO
 uh
 what
 is
 that


thing
 called?
 If
 he's
 gonna


>> if
 he's
 gonna
 IPO
 SpaceX,
 he's
 going
 to


need
 a
 theme
 for
 the
 market
 to
 rally


around.
 And
 so
 by
 propagating
 this,
 it


could
 be
 a
 big
 big
 thing
 for


revenue
 expectations.


>> That
 was
 going
 to
 be
 my
 last
 topic
 for


the
 day.
 So
 we'll
 end
 it
 off
 on
 this.


Just
 raw
 thoughts
 from
 all
 three
 of
 you.


Chris,
 we'll
 start
 with
 you.
 Do
 you


think
 this
 data
 center
 and
 space
 thing


is
 real?
 Rocket
 Lab
 up
 10%
 I
 think


literally
 just
 off
 the
 headline
 that


this
 is
 happening.


>> I
 think
 it's
 real
 but
 the
 timeline
 is
 a


little
 bit
 more
 stretched
 out
 than


thing.
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


technical
 challenges
 that
 have
 to
 be


have
 to
 be
 solved
 before
 this
 thing


becomes
 a
 a
 major
 part
 of
 the
 um
 AI
 data


center
 buildout.
 And
 I
 think
 there's
 an


immediate
 need
 right
 now.
 We
 don't
 have


the
 time.
 Well,
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 don't


have
 the
 time
 to
 say,
 "Yeah,
 let's
 wait


until
 the
 data
 centers
 can
 be
 built
 in


space,
 right?"
 You've
 got
 a
 whole
 bunch


of
 issues
 around
 cooling.
 You
 need
 to


make
 sure
 that
 reliability
 is
 on
 another


level
 because
 I'm
 guessing
 that
 these


things
 are
 going
 to
 be
 unmanned,
 right?


Like,
 who's
 going
 to
 stay
 up
 there
 to


maintain?
 I
 imagine
 that's
 a
 job
 job.


That's
 a
 job
 description,
 Sam.
 Working


at
 a
 data
 center
 in
 space.
 I
 wonder
 what


the
 pay
 for
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 like.


You
 know,
 it's
 like
 Sanjieve,
 go
 plug
 in


this
 rack
 real
 quick.
 [laughter]


>> I
 always
 think
 of
 Chappelle
 show
 every


single
 time
 I
 hear
 putting
 data
 centers


or
 going
 outer
 space
 and
 stuff.
 It's


just
 it's
 so
 funny.
 Like
 I
 think
 I've


watched
 a
 Chappelle
 show
 clip
 like
 three


or
 four
 times
 in
 the
 last
 couple
 of


days.
 [laughter]


Okay,
 I'm
 sorry.
 Building
 data
 centers


in
 outer
 space.
 Yeah,
 probably
 at
 some


point
 in
 the
 future,
 but
 like
 it's
 not


happening
 anytime
 soon.
 Like
 there's
 so


much
 real
 estate
 everywhere
 in
 this


world,
 including
 the
 United
 States
 of


America,
 where
 power
 is
 cheap
 to
 build


data
 centers
 in
 outer
 space.
 Like
 it's


just
 come
 on.
 Like
 that's
 not
 going
 to


happen
 for
 a
 while.
 But
 at
 the
 same


time,
 I
 do
 think
 that
 the
 probably
 the


one
 or
 two
 year
 out
 for
 Rocket
 Lab
 is


pretty
 important
 because
 you
 already
 see


SpaceX
 potentially
 being
 a
 $ 1.5


trillion
 company.
 What
 do
 they
 have
 $150


billion
 in
 revenue?
 I
 forget
 the
 exact


amount
 of
 revenue
 they
 have,
 but
 like
 a


30
 to40
 billion
 company,
 which
 is
 just


as
 much
 as
 launching
 multiple
 rockets
 to


outer
 space.
 This
 is
 pretty
 important,


right?
 So,
 that's
 going
 to
 have
 the


bidding
 that
 SpaceX
 is
 getting
 bid
 on,


but


SpaceX
 is
 private


>> RS
 Mars


>> Okay.


>> I
 don't
 know.


Don't
 play
 the
 clip


>> between
 the
 two.
 SpaceX
 has
 Starlink


whereas
 Rocket
 Lab
 does
 not.
 Now,
 we


haven't
 been
 to
 the
 moon
 in
 God
 knows


how
 long.
 The
 idea
 that
 we're
 going
 to


build
 data
 centers


in
 space.


That's
 not
 happening
 anytime
 soon.


Eventually,
 they're
 going
 to
 do
 it


because
 it's
 247
 solar.
 And
 that's
 the


real
 reason
 why
 they
 want
 to
 do
 it.
 But


you
 there's
 no
 way
 I
 I
 would
 put
 serious


money,
 like
 serious
 money,
 within
 five


years,
 this
 isn't
 even
 a
 thing.


>> Yeah.
 But
 here's
 the
 thing.
 You
 don't


need
 that
 to
 be
 the
 thing
 to
 get
 real


value
 out
 of
 it,
 especially
 if
 you're


good
 at
 trading.
 I
 mean,
 look
 at
 this


quantum
 thing,
 bro.
 No.


>> Oh
 god,
 stupid
 sector.


>> Quantum
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 anything
 at


least
 for
 another
 5
 to
 10
 years.
 Yet,


people
 are
 like,
 "Yeah,
 I'll
 pay
 $20


billion
 for
 a
 company
 that


>> How
 about
 these
 companies
 aren't
 even


going
 to
 be
 here?
 Freaking
 if


Alphabet
 and
 IBM
 aren't
 figuring
 it
 out,


these
 companies
 can't
 compete
 with
 them.


I'm
 sorry.
 They
 just
 can't.
 It's
 not


happening."
 Yeah,
 but
 the
 stock
 price
 is


>> one
 of
 those
 two
 is
 going
 to
 win
 the


quantum
 space.
 Not
 these
 little


companies.


>> Whoa.
 What
 the
 hell
 is
 going
 on?


Broadcom.
 Shoot.


>> What
 is
 Octan
 saying,
 bro?


>> Oh,
 no.
 I'm
 about
 to
 clip
 those
 Burger


King
 coupons
 right
 now.
 [laughter]


We're
 We're
 eating
 We
 are
 not
 eating


sushi
 tonight.
 That's


>> I
 mean,
 they
 look
 guys,
 these
 guys
 were


trading
 at
 38
 almost
 39
 full.


>> But
 you
 weren't
 saying
 this
 when
 the


stock
 was
 up.
 You
 were
 saying
 the
 stock


was
 up,
 but
 like
 when
 the
 stock
 was
 up,


it
 was
 much


overvalued
 for
 a
 while.


>> The
 stock
 was
 up
 3%.
 I
 don't
 think


anyone
 was
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 goodness."
 It's


like


>> I
 know,
 but
 like
 now
 that
 this
 price
 is


going
 down.
 Oh,
 look.
 I
 told
 you
 guys,


right?


>> BUT
 DIDN'T
 I
 JUST
 BUT
 DIDN'T
 I
 JUST
 SAY


THAT
 NVIDIA
 is
 trading
 at
 22
 times


forward
 broadcast.


>> I
 even
 showed
 you
 the
 I
 even
 showed
 you


the
 chart.
 Like
 it
 doesn't
 make
 sense


makes
 sense.
 makes
 it
 it
 makes
 sense


that
 you
 know
 Nvidia
 should
 not
 be


trading
 at
 a
 cheaper
 valuation
 than


Broadcom
 but
 this
 is
 the
 argument
 with


>> not
 by
 double


>> by
 double


>> hey
 I
 mean
 like
 do
 we
 need
 to
 name


Palunteer
 like
 everyone's
 been
 arguing


about
 that
 valuation
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and


look
 where
 it
 is
 today
 it's
 still
 pretty


up
 there
 right
 like
 it
 just


>> Sam
 it's
 no
 one
 no
 one's
 hold
 on
 no


one's
 saying
 the
 valuation
 on
 Palunteer


isn't
 intense
 but
 the
 point
 is
 expecting


pounder
 to
 be
 $250
 tomorrow
 is
 a
 intense


expectation
 for
 those
 expecting
 Broadcom


to
 what
 go
 to
 450
 next
 week,
 next
 month.


I
 mean,
 it
 was
 I
 don't
 expect
 bouncer
 to


be
 250
 next
 month.
 I
 think
 that's
 being


realistic
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 we're


seeing
 here.


>> I
 mean,
 look
 at
 Broadcom
 and
 Meta.


>> And
 look,
 I
 didn't
 update
 Broadcom.
 I'll


do
 it
 tonight
 because
 I
 don't
 have
 all


the
 numbers,
 but
 Broadcom
 was
 a
 bigger


company
 than
 Meta
 heading
 into
 the
 print


tonight.
 and
 they
 do
 a
 speckle
 of
 the


revenue,
 a
 third
 of
 the
 IBIDA,


a
 quarter
 of
 the
 cash
 from
 operations.


The
 valuation
 never
 made
 sense
 for


Brocom.
 Full
 stop.


>> Yeah,


>> look,
 I
 I
 I
 didn't
 even
 dive
 deep
 into


Broadcom's
 valuation.
 All
 I
 saw
 was
 the


freaking
 chart
 on
 a
 $2
 trillion
 company


is
 up
 80%.
 The
 risk-to-reward


is
 probably
 skewed
 to
 risk
 versus


reward.
 If
 they
 say
 anything
 bad,
 guess


what?
 He
 said
 something
 bad.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 what


>> and
 let's
 just
 keep
 in
 mind
 that
 after


hours
 really
 doesn't
 matter.
 It's
 low


liquidity,
 low
 volume.
 This
 could
 snap


back
 tomorrow
 morning.
 This
 is
 just


after
 hours
 Also,


>> we
 we
 saw
 what
 happened
 yesterday


overnight
 after
 hours.


>> I
 mean,
 think
 about
 this.
 Oracle
 Oracle


found
 a
 floor
 today.
 I
 really
 did
 not


think
 it
 was
 finding
 a
 floor.
 It
 found
 a


floor
 around
 190
 and
 finished
 around


198.
 This
 could
 get
 bought
 up
 in
 the


morning
 very
 easily.


>> That's
 fair.


>> I
 don't
 think
 so,
 guys.
 I
 think
 even
 on


this
 thing
 should
 get
 back
 down
 to
 the


at
 least
 to
 the
 mid20s,
 high
 20s
 before


this
 thing
 even
 remotely
 seems


appetizing.


>> Well,
 you
 know,


>> I'm
 not
 going
 to
 say
 where
 I
 think


Broadcom
 could
 trade.
 I'm
 just
 saying


there
 is
 a
 reality
 where
 it
 gets
 bought


up
 tomorrow.


>> I
 would
 never
 buy
 Broadcom
 for
 long


term.


>> Different
 story.


>> I
 would
 never
 buy
 it
 for
 long
 term
 ever.


>> I
 would
 look
 to
 buy
 like
 Adobe
 or


something
 long
 term,
 but
 like
 Broadcom


is
 not
 a
 long-term
 trade
 at
 all.
 Not


here.
 Not
 here.
 Right.
 Had
 a
 pretty
 good


sign
 coming
 in
 today.
 Didn't
 work
 out.


>> Look
 at
 Oracle.
 Same
 thing.
 Don't
 go


crazy
 buying
 companies
 when
 they
 they've


had
 these
 short-term
 catalysts
 and
 then


they've
 spiked
 super
 high.
 So,
 where
 is


it?
 Oracle
 right
 here.
 Oracle
 normally


trades
 right
 here
 at
 a
 from
 a
 forward
 EV


to
 EB
 about
 18
 to
 20
 times.
 Okay.


Because
 of
 that
 RPO
 news,
 they
 went
 all


the
 way
 to
 27
 on
 a
 forward
 basis.
 Now,


they're
 back
 down
 to
 1718
 again.
 I
 mean,


wait,
 so
 Chris,
 where
 do
 you
 think
 you


think
 Broadcom
 should
 be?
 What
 price


instead
 of
 400
 like
 350?


>> I
 mean,
 you
 have
 to
 just
 you
 just
 have


to
 do
 the
 calculation.
 Um,
 depending
 on


what
 kind
 of
 share
 buybacks
 they're


doing,
 because
 one
 of
 the
 things
 about


Broadcom
 is
 that
 the
 prolific
 uh
 buyers


of
 their
 own
 shares,
 right?
 So,


Broadcom,
 like
 let's
 say
 they
 go
 back


down
 to
 half,
 not
 half,
 let's
 say
 about


30%
 of
 whatever
 the
 stock
 price
 is


closing.
 I
 think
 that
 would
 be
 a
 good
 a


good
 thing
 for
 Broadcom
 to
 be
 in.
 I


mean,
 because
 you're
 still
 getting
 the


inflection
 on
 um
 the
 AI,
 so
 you're


you're
 you're
 [laughter]


>> a
 30%
 hit.
 Do
 you
 think
 Nvidia
 doesn't


fall
 with
 it
 or
 do
 you
 think


>> Nvidia's
 already
 got
 Nvidia's
 cheap


right
 now?


>> I
 think
 it's
 completely
 stupid
 how
 like


one
 of
 these
 stocks
 sells
 off
 and
 like


the
 But
 that's
 just
 the
 nature
 of
 the


market.
 They
 all
 have
 similar
 trades,


right?


in
 the
 short
 term
 they
 do
 but
 like
 I
 I


think


>> you
 know
 Broadcom's
 down
 4%
 after
 hours


Nvidia
 is
 only
 down
 50
 basis
 points


which
 is
 pretty
 justified
 right
 but
 like


I
 just
 thought
 that
 Oracle
 being
 down


like
 13
 14%
 Nvidia
 was
 down
 like
 four
 or


five%
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 pretty


ridiculous
 especially
 Nebia
 is
 going


down
 like
 85
 bucks
 like
 the
 market
 just


does
 these
 moves
 in
 the
 short
 term
 and


that's
 the
 point
 of
 these
 trades
 to
 take


advantage
 of
 that
 short-term
 move
 but


the
 long-term
 thesis
 like
 nothing's


changed
 like
 what
 just
 because
 Broadcom


guides
 lower
 for
 next
 year,
 that
 doesn't


mean
 that
 like
 all
 these
 other
 companies


going
 to
 guide
 lower.
 We've
 seen
 it


happen
 many
 times.
 Like
 AMD
 went
 to
 100


bucks
 and
 the
 market
 was
 at
 all-time


highs,
 right?
 And
 then
 look
 at
 AMD
 now.


It
 just
 recently
 hit
 its
 all-time
 highs.


Like
 these
 short-term
 dynamic
 moves


don't
 really
 matter
 for
 the
 long
 term,


right?
 So
 that
 is
 the
 the
 real
 bet
 in


the
 market
 is
 the
 long
 is
 the
 medium
 at


least
 to
 the
 long
 term.
 That's
 the
 real


bet
 in
 the
 market.
 But
 sometimes
 you


have
 these
 opportunities
 in
 short-term


trades
 and
 Broadcom's
 going
 to
 do


whatever
 it
 does.
 I
 just
 hope
 it
 doesn't


take
 the
 market
 down
 with
 it.
 That
 would


really
 suck.


>> Look
 at
 look
 at
 uh
 look
 at
 AMD's
 forward


uh
 multiple
 right
 now.


AMD
 is
 in
 the
 green.
 Okay,
 look
 at
 where


they
 are.
 They're
 at
 37.
 When
 is
 AMD


report?


>> They
 already
 did.


>> They
 already
 did.


>> They
 already
 did.
 So,
 they're
 AMD
 was


able
 to
 maintain
 it
 to
 some
 degree.
 I


mean,
 it
 went
 up
 all
 the
 way
 here.
 So,


how
 how's
 AMD
 done
 in
 the
 last
 30
 days?


AMD
 is
 down
 for
 the
 month
 7%.


>> No,
 the
 the
 value
 play
 has
 been
 the
 play


for
 the
 last
 two
 weeks
 if
 not
 for
 the


last
 couple
 of
 months.
 And
 that's
 the


reason
 why
 you've
 seen
 these
 cheap


companies
 actually
 catch
 bid
 because


that
 has
 that
 the
 rotation
 is
 happening


in
 front
 of
 our
 eyes.
 Like
 IW
 was
 up
 1%


today
 and
 the
 Q's
 were
 technically
 down


today,
 right?
 And
 if
 you
 looked
 at
 just


recent
 companies,
 especially
 the
 value


stocks
 versus
 the
 tech
 stocks,
 and
 it


doesn't
 just
 have
 to
 be
 like
 value


stocks
 as
 in
 like
 Verizon,
 all
 that


stuff,
 you
 look
 at
 the
 other
 side
 of
 the


stocks
 that
 are
 actually
 at
 pretty


attractive
 valuations,
 those
 are


actually
 up
 in
 the
 last
 couple
 of
 months


or
 less
 than
 a
 month
 versus
 these


high-flying
 tech
 stocks,
 right?
 IN
 is
 at


$43,


but
 then
 you
 turn
 around,
 you
 look
 at


like
 Amcore,
 it's
 basically
 doubled
 in


the
 last
 couple
 of
 months.
 And
 I'm
 not


trying
 to
 say
 one
 company
 is
 better
 than


the
 other.
 I'm
 just
 saying
 like
 high


beta
 no
 revenue
 or
 pre
 supposedly


pre-revenue


before
 the
 $2
 billion
 $5
 billion
 AR
 is


not
 doing
 as
 hot
 as
 a
 company
 that
 is


already
 expanding
 gross
 margins
 already


profitable
 is
 cheap
 on
 a
 valuation


perspective
 from
 a
 price
 of
 sales


standpoint
 that
 is
 where
 the
 real
 alpha


is
 right
 now
 and
 then
 degeneracy
 is


degeneracy


>> yeah
 basically
 Sam
 you're
 making
 the


case
 to
 not
 be
 in
 broadcast
 calls
 But


nonetheless,
 degeneracy
 is
 degeneracy.


And
 we've
 all
 been
 through
 it.
 We've
 all


done
 it.
 So,


>> you
 know,
 you
 get
 you
 get
 so
 excited,


you
 get
 so
 many
 things
 right,
 and
 then


you
 buy
 BMR,
 you
 know,


>> all
 of
 us
 with
 BMR.
 [laughter]


>> Hey,
 man.
 Who
 knows?
 BMR,
 where
 is
 that


at
 after
 hours?


>> Dude,
 it's
 covered
 so
 much.
 Thank
 God.


Like,
 I
 was
 down
 way
 more,
 man.


>> It's
 still
 going
 after
 hours.


>> Oh,
 my
 cover
 calls
 are
 helping.
 My
 cover


calls
 are
 helping.
 Thank
 God.
 Thank
 you,


Tom
 Lee.
 Keep
 pumping
 my
 bags,
 please.


>> I
 just
 think
 it's
 amazing.
 Like,
 it
 went


from
 $23,
 $24
 to
 $42
 the
 other
 day.


Like,
 that's
 a
 crazy
 move.


>> My
 wife
 works
 from
 home
 now.
 I
 can't


even
 get
 away
 anymore.
 Tom
 Lee
 saved
 me.


>> Did
 Did
 your
 Did
 your
 wife
 know
 how
 how


much
 you
 you
 lost
 on
 the
 webinar?


>> Yeah.


>> I
 didn't
 lose
 it.


>> I
 have
 an
 unrealized
 loss
 until
 you


sell,
 baby.


>> That's
 right.
 That's
 right.
 So,


question.
 I
 did
 well.


>> Sorry.
 Go
 ahead.


>> There there's
 always
 a
 good
 intellectual


way
 to
 describe
 uh
 a
 paper
 loss.
 You


know,
 I
 didn't
 lose
 the
 money.
 It's
 just


at
 the
 moment


>> the
 account
 just
 says
 a
 different


number.
 That's
 it.


>> I'm
 up
 I'm
 up
 massively
 on


>> I'm
 up
 massively
 on
 on
 meta.
 So,
 I'll


take
 I'll
 I'll
 be
 like
 it's
 okay,
 you


know?
 So,
 net
 net
 I'm
 up.
 That's
 what


matters.
 That
 is
 the
 only
 thing
 that


matters.
 And
 Carnival
 was
 up
 today.
 All


the
 cruise
 lines
 are
 up.
 So,
 Cruz
 Patel


Chris
 is
 back,
 baby.


Dude,
 there's
 definitely
 people
 in
 the


chat
 that
 have
 not
 told
 their


significant
 other
 how
 down
 they've
 been


on
 a
 trade,
 and
 it
 just
 ended
 up
 like


working
 out
 over
 time.
 And,
 you
 know,


they
 didn't
 have
 to
 disclose
 it,
 but
 it


can
 be
 ugly
 sometimes
 to
 tell
 people
 how


bad.


>> But,
 you
 know
 what's
 funny?
 When
 BMR
 was


down,
 my
 wife
 couldn't
 see
 like
 she's


like,
 "Why
 are
 you
 looking
 at
 your
 thing


all
 the
 time?"
 I
 was
 like,
 "Ah,
 BMR
 is


down."
 She's
 like, "It's
 okay.
 It


doesn't
 matter."
 So,
 she's
 cool
 like


that
 where
 she's,
 you
 know,
 she


understands.
 Like,
 first
 of
 all,
 if
 I


didn't
 take
 these
 these
 risks
 in
 the


first
 place,
 we
 wouldn't
 be
 where
 we
 are


in
 life.
 You
 know,
 all
 of
 us.
 All
 of
 us.


You
 could
 have
 just
 been
 like
 on
 the


sidelines.
 Yeah.
 Let
 me
 just
 buy
 the


spy.
 I
 wouldn't
 be
 where
 I
 am
 today
 if
 I


just
 bought
 the
 spy.
 So,
 she
 understands


that.
 So,
 you
 know
 what?
 You
 were
 with


me
 for
 the
 gains.
 You're
 going
 to
 be


with
 me
 for
 some
 of
 these
 losses,
 right?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 We
 don't
 know
 if
 she's


still
 with
 you
 after
 the
 losses,
 but


we'll
 see.
 Hopefully.
 [laughter]


You're
 making
 the
 assumption
 right
 now.


I'm
 just
 kidding.


>> Be
 loyal.
 She's
 loyal.


>> She
 She's
 loyal.
 She's
 loyal.


>> No,
 Chris
 Brown.


>> That
 is
 it
 for
 us.
 Thank
 you
 everybody


for
 being
 here.
 Unfortunately,


uh
 not
 the
 best
 price
 action
 on


Broadcom,
 but
 we're
 going
 to
 see


tomorrow.
 Again,
 this
 thing
 could
 get


eaten
 up
 quick.
 We'll
 see
 how
 the
 street


reacts
 to
 it.
 Down
 about
 7%
 after
 hours.


Lulu
 ended
 up
 crushing.
 Costco
 basically


flat.
 Um,
 tomorrow's
 Friday.
 Another


week
 of
 December
 that
 has
 gone
 by.
 S&Ps


at
 all-time
 highs,
 which
 I
 know
 is
 kind


of
 crazy
 given
 some
 of
 these
 other
 high


beta
 stocks
 that
 are
 down,
 but
 does
 seem


like
 a
 more
 healthy
 rotation
 happening


in
 the
 market,
 which
 is
 not
 too
 bad.
 Uh,


Chris's
 Twitter,
 Sam's
 Twitter,
 and


Steve's
 Twitter,
 and
 YouTube
 I'm
 putting


in
 the
 chat
 in
 the
 description.
 Any


final
 words,
 Chris,
 Sam,
 or
 Steve?


>> Go
 watch
 that
 P.
 Diddy
 um
 Netflix


documentary.
 Oh,
 dude,
 I
 have
 one
 quote


now.
 I
 would
 never
 want
 to
 be
 friends


with
 a
 guy
 like
 Puff
 Daddy.
 I
 would
 also


not
 want
 to
 be
 enemies
 with
 a
 guy
 like


50
 Cent.
 If
 you
 see
 this
 documentary,
 oh


my
 god,


>> I
 started
 watching
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 it


last
 night,
 but
 then
 I
 fell
 asleep.
 But


I'm
 gonna


>> It's
 bad.
 It
 was
 bad,
 dude.
 It
 was
 bad.


>> Chris
 is
 making
 me
 want
 to
 get
 a
 net


Netflix
 subscription.


>> You
 don't
 have
 a
 Netflix
 subscription?


What's
 wrong
 with
 you?


>> Netflix
 sucks.


>> No,
 I
 get
 it.
 But
 still,
 you
 subscribe


to
 everything.
 So,
 I
 thought,


>> yeah,
 but
 Netflix
 is
 the
 one
 that
 I


won't
 continue
 to
 pay
 for
 if
 I'm
 not


using
 it.
 I'll
 pay
 for
 everything
 else


except
 for
 Netflix.
 It's
 just
 something


I
 just
 I
 don't
 know.


>> Now,
 I
 know
 why
 you've
 been
 against
 this


whole
 Netflix
 thing.
 You
 don't
 you
 don't


you
 just
 don't
 like
 them.


>> Well,
 listen.
 I'm
 a
 shareholder
 of


Warner
 Brothers,
 so
 not
 that
 they
 need


my
 permission.
 I'm
 not
 a
 big


shareholder,
 but
 you
 know,
 the
 deal
 at


$30
 a
 share,
 all
 cash.
 Give
 me
 that
 deal


all
 day.


>> Yeah.


All
 right,
 that's
 it
 for
 us,
 folks.


Thank
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 Sam,


Chris,
 Steve,
 thank
 you
 for
 joining.


I'll
 be
 live
 with
 Steve
 later
 tonight.


His
 YouTube
 right
 there
 is
 in
 the
 chat.


Sam
 also
 started
 Oh,
 Sam,
 why
 don't
 you


uh
 just
 give
 us
 a
 picture
 show
 of


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 teamed
 up with
 the
 Wolf.
 We


got
 um
 we
 got
 the
 stream
 running
 four


times
 a
 week.
 The
 Solid
 Report.
 I
 mean,


basically,
 I've
 been
 going
 live
 for


quite
 some
 time.
 Not
 killing
 it
 like


Steve.
 Steve
 is
 just
 on
 that
 streaming


game.
 I
 I
 don't
 This
 is
 the
 new
 Joseph


Carlson
 in
 the
 making
 right
 there.
 Um,


but
 yeah,
 guys,
 go
 ahead
 and
 check
 it


out.
 It's
 Wolf,
 uh,
 Wolf
 Financial.
 I


think
 you
 guys
 know
 what
 the,
 uh,
 what


the
 handle
 is
 for
 that
 one.
 But
 yeah,


check
 it
 out,
 guys.
 Um,


for
 like
 a
 midday


>> during
 month,
 right?
 Is
 that
 like
 2
 p.m.


every
 day?


>> Yeah,
 going
 for
 like
 the
 midday
 stream.


Uh,
 sort
 of
 just
 kind
 of
 filling
 that


gap
 there.
 But,
 uh,
 hey
 man,
 either
 way,


the
 show
 must
 go
 on,
 right?
 So,
 if
 if


you're
 out,
 the
 show
 must
 go
 on.
 And,


uh,
 also,
 uh,
 team
 with
 you
 guys
 in


these
 streams.
 These
 streams
 are
 really


cool
 to
 hang
 out
 with
 you
 guys.


That's
 right.
 Don't
 buy
 Broadcom
 at
 38


times
 forward
 multiple.


>> I
 don't
 know.
 What
 can
 I
 say?


>> We
 should
 have
 done
 this
 one
 day
 ago.
 We


could
 have
 told
 you.
 We
 could
 have
 been


like,


>> "You're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 get
 Chris
 is


getting
 cocky
 now.
 You're
 going
 to
 have


to
 get
 him
 back
 on
 one
 of
 these
 tops."


>> I
 hope
 Broadcom
 is
 up
 just
 to
 rubbing


his
 face
 tomorrow
 because
 this
 guy's


going
 to
 be
 eating
 his
 lunch
 tomorrow.


If
 Brocom's
 down
 four
 and
 a
 half%,
 okay,


cool.
 But
 if
 Brockcom's
 up
 tomorrow,


then
 I'll
 still
 be
 losing
 because
 those


are
 options.
 So,
 it
 won't
 even
 matter.


[laughter]


Broadcom
 can
 turn
 around.
 This
 is
 after


hours.
 After
 hours
 does
 not
 matter.


>> But
 here's
 one
 before
 we
 go.
 Having


conversations
 like
 this
 is
 what's
 going


to
 make
 us
 much
 much
 better
 investors.


If
 you
 try
 to
 invest
 solo
 without
 your


friends
 around
 you,
 without
 testing
 your


thesis
 and
 your
 hypothesis
 or
 even


confirming
 your
 biases
 or
 challenging


your
 biases,
 I
 feel,
 and
 I
 don't
 know


about
 you
 guys,
 if
 you
 disagree,
 agree,


whatever,
 I
 feel
 like
 I've
 become
 a


better
 investor
 because
 I
 have


conversations
 with
 guys
 like
 you
 guys.


>> I
 have
 found
 opportunities
 because
 of


people
 like
 you.
 I
 have
 I
 have
 stayed


away
 from
 certain
 things
 because
 of


people
 like
 you
 that
 ended
 up
 that
 could


have
 been
 really
 bad.
 Right.
 So
 I
 think


over
 time
 we
 have
 been
 able
 to


collaborate
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 and


that
 collaborative
 effort
 is
 paying


dividends
 right
 now.
 Like
 right
 now
 like


I
 said
 that
 guy
 Stock
 Talk
 Weekly
 me
 and


Sam
 were
 talking
 about
 it
 how
 he's
 got
 a


lot
 of
 you
 know
 great
 companies
 that


he's
 done.


>> Yeah.
 A
 does
 the
 earnings
 edge
 with
 them


all
 the
 time.


>> Yeah.
 and
 he's
 been
 able
 to
 dig
 up
 some


really
 good
 stuff
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time


even
 even
 from
 an
 investing
 standpoint


he's
 got
 some
 really
 good
 ideas
 that
 I


would
 never
 have
 thought
 that
 hey
 this


is
 a
 good
 way
 to
 do
 research
 this
 is
 a


good
 company
 to
 look
 at.
 So,
 I
 think
 as


you
 broaden
 your
 experience
 with
 other


investors,
 I
 think
 that
 and
 you
 develop


that
 network,
 it's
 a
 freaking
 great


thing
 and
 it's
 a
 powerful
 alpha


generator
 that
 uh
 that
 you
 really
 can't


get
 by
