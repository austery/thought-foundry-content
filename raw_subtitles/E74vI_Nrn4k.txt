There is a sound the planet makes
when it asks a species to grow up.
Can you hear it inside of you?
Many faith traditions teach
that at thresholds two paths appear,
one of contraction and one of evolution.
Today, eight billion of us
stand at humanity's
most consequential threshold yet.
And these moments arrive
in many different forms.
It's the families forced
to abandon coastal homes
because of sea level rise.
It's communities watching
decades of memories reduced to ash.
It's elderly couples
choosing between cooling or eating
because of rising bills.
These are real experiences
I've witnessed in the past year.
And as political leaders
make climate decisions
that arbitrarily mark
billions of lives as disposable,
perhaps you've also felt
that catch in your chest
when wondering:
Will the future still want me?
This is what thresholds can feel like.
Loss resonating on one side,
yet luminous possibility on the other.
And these climate thresholds
do mirror our personal ones.
It's the unexpected diagnosis.
It's the loss of a loved one.
It's the path that suddenly closes.
Each and every single time they ask us:
Who will we become
when everything we know unravels?
And this is what I want
to explore with you today.
Not just environmental challenge,
but an invitation.
Can we all still rise to our best selves,
even when collapse tempts us
towards self-preservation?
Now for years,
I believed the climate emergency
was primarily about technical
and systemic solutions.
But in devastated communities,
I found that those demonstrating
the deepest resilience
drew on something more fundamental.
It was spiritual wisdom
cultivated across generations.
In each disaster zone,
I found a pattern that charts had missed.
It was the spiritual
infrastructure all around us:
church basements, mosque courtyards,
Sikh gurdwaras cooking tons of free dal
that kept communities together
until formal aid arrived.
Yes, water pumps are vital,
but someone must believe
that strangers deserve that water.
Faith, as I've come to learn and realize,
is actually about
the logistics of the heart.
These traditions aren't relics,
but living laboratories of resilience.
Their rituals aren't superstition,
but social circuitry,
routing cards where normal circuits fail.
Science can give us the numbers.
Policy can give us the laws.
We know that the numbers don’t comfort
frightened children in a storm,
and laws aren't the prayers
that we speak at funerals.
For the past decade,
I've been very fortunate enough
to work with global coalitions
of faith communities,
confronting climate change and restoring
ecosystems from land to ocean.
And today, I'd like to share
just a few of these insights
that I learned from these traditions
about how we might rise
to our best selves.
And I've actually already shared
the first one with you.
It's that faith functions
as a collapse navigation system.
These traditions that are
sometimes dismissed as archaic
actually hold the key
to civilization's continuity.
Think about it.
These traditions survived
multiple plagues, empires, endless wars,
and even mini ice ages
serving as civilizational black boxes
for these uncertain times.
Times like these,
when we face different interpretations
about what this moment means
and who it calls us to become.
And faith traditions can offer us
some guidance through this uncertainty.
So I invite you
to think about those moments
when you practice in something
that is actually older than markets
and older than nations.
Those daily practices
etched into human muscle memory
long before borders and currencies
defined our exchanges.
These traditions aren't just relics,
they are your navigation technologies
tested through collapse after collapse.
So ask yourself: What ancient
algorithm of survival am I carrying?
Because the wisdom we now need
is not just waiting for us
in new inventions,
but it's also encoded
in these daily practices
that have sustained human dignity
across history's hardest passages.
Yet we also know that even the most
sophisticated navigation technologies
require accurate data
about where we truly stand.
And this brings me to the next insight.
It's radical honesty.
A truth that is always surprising
about climate action
is that it begins with a paradox.
We must look inwards
before we can effectively act outwards.
I love how the tradition
of Hazrat Inayat Khan
in the Sufi tradition
teaches that our true work
involves reconciling the irreconcilable,
and climate action
needs that same reconciliation.
Now let's be real.
We've all become experts
at identifying external obstacles.
Political gridlock,
corporate interests, colonial legacies.
All very real.
But faith traditions invite us
to look at a more subtle barrier:
our own contradictions.
Hypocrisy isn't just a sin,
it's a GPS pin that can point us
to deeper transformation.
Islam calls this Mahasabha,
Hinduism -- Svadhyaya.
Whatever the language,
the practice is constant.
Hold up a mirror and name the gap
between the world we dream about
and the ones our actions create.
Whether it's the climate activist
always flying to summits
or the congregation preaching stewardship
while their endowment
funds fossil fuel expansion.
These aren't necessarily
disqualifications,
but they're doorways
to deeper authenticity.
And radical honesty should also apply
to the continuous examination
of the value systems
that we hold most sacred.
I know that faith traditions
that also birthed liberation movements
sanctified colonial conquest.
And also today’s climate activism,
with all of its moral clarity,
can still become rigid, dogmatic
and blind to its own contradictions.
So tonight, let us ask ourselves:
Where do our actions cast shadows
on the very values
that we hold most sacred?
Can you think of an example
from your own life?
Now this question isn’t meant
to shame us, but to free us,
for it's precisely when we stand
in these tender spaces of contradiction
that moral courage can emerge.
And when we apply the same
radical honesty to economic systems,
we arrive at our next insight.
It's what I like to call
the systemic sacred.
It's when our deepest values
and our economic choices converge.
Now if you look back throughout history,
you'll see that both faith and commerce
together have shaped civilizations.
When they diverge, cultures can tear.
But when they harmonize,
cultures can bloom.
Judaism Shmita cycle
embeds ecological rest
and debt forgiveness
into economic rhythms and life.
Buddhist economics emphasizes
sufficiency over endless growth.
Catholic integral economics
recognizes forests and rivers
as kin rather than commodities.
Out of these traditions emerges
a fundamentally different
approach to economics,
one that supports
the three great restorations:
ecosystem restoration,
healing our planet’s wounded systems;
economic restoration,
reimagining how we exchange value
without extraction;
and inner restoration,
renewing our moral imagination
when despair threatens to narrow
our vision of what is actually possible.
Now in my own work advising banks and NGOs
on sustainable Islamic finance,
I've actually seen how this can scale,
and it's pretty incredible.
If just five percent
of the projected eight-trillion-dollar
Islamic finance market by 2030
is invested in climate resilience,
that represents 400 billion dollars
for regenerative infrastructure.
Now that is not charity.
That's reciprocity restored.
So if you shape economic future,
especially those of us
in boardrooms and institutions,
try this:
subject your next big decision
to a spiritual audit.
Ask not just will this generate
sustainable returns,
but does this contribute
to the three great restorations?
Because markets, like our souls,
are also waiting for instructions worthy
of the threshold moment that we face.
And while economics relates
to our material exchanges,
the final insight I'd like to share
illuminates something
a little bit more subtle.
It's the power of beauty
to guide us when certainty fails.
If we read today's story
of humanity backwards,
it might actually just begin
with us dismantling beauty.
We turn forests into lumber,
animals into production units,
we extract wonder from children's eyes
and break our relationship
with the natural world.
But I wonder, wouldn't it be amazing
if our descendants identified
a different starting point for this story?
When we rediscovered beauty
as essential for survival.
Baha'i teachings teach that beauty
are divine attributes made visible.
Zen Buddhism's wabi-sabi
sees beauty in imperfection.
Shinto honors a spirit in everything
from mountains to roadside stones,
and all recognize a common lesson
that we rarely protect
what we haven't first learned
to appreciate in its true beauty.
But this relationship
between beauty and protection
goes even deeper.
Many faith traditions teach
that divine assistance
in times of climate crisis
arrives not from above,
but as the presence of hope and beauty
within the human heart.
Prophets didn't just
predict better worlds,
they spoke and acted
their hope into being.
Their imagination was practical,
imagining paths invisible
to rational thought alone.
So the next time
you encounter a moment of beauty,
it might just be divine assistance
arriving in its purest form.
The eighth century mystic
Rabi’a al-Basri from Iraq
really understood this
when she said to God,
"Your hope in my heart
is the rarest treasure."
To reflect on what if
this moment of beauty
is trying to show me
a more hopeful future,
but desperately needs my voice
and words to bring it into being?
Now
none of this, let me tell you,
is a distraction from our climate reality.
But it's a radical act of trust
in uncertain times,
because I truly believe
our climate emergency
is an examination of the soul.
The same forces behind
each ecological destruction
arise from the same human heart
that also houses mercy,
justice and repair.
This is an abstract spirituality.
It's about who we become
at the edge of everything we know.
And some of you might also be wondering,
must I be religious
for any of this to matter?
No.
When despair is polluting the skies,
borrowing courage 
from any wisdom tradition
is not only permitted, but necessary.
Faith traditions are simply
very old laboratories
that kept the lights on long enough
to record what worked.
I've seen temple communities
restoring the same sacred rivers
that contributed to the flooding
of their own homes,
and mothers planting olive trees
under bombardment
so that their children
may know what peace tastes like.
So ...
here we stand
at our most consequential threshold.
To borrow a lesson
from the Book of Genesis,
the heart of our human challenge
is to honor our promise to the earth,
not to destroy the world.
And this threshold moment
invites all of us to rise to that promise.
The door of destruction right now
is very easy to find.
The door of renewal
is quiet.
So ...
Who will we become together
as we cross this threshold?
Thank you for listening.
