Hey
 everybody,
 welcome
 back
 to
 the


channel.
 We
 are
 back
 on
 another
 episode


of
 the
 daily
 recap.
 We've
 got
 a
 lot
 to


talk
 about
 today.
 Uh
 first
 of
 all,
 this


morning
 we
 had,
 if
 you
 were
 with
 me
 on


the
 market
 open,
 a
 pretty
 wild
 headline


that
 came
 out.
 Everything
 was
 green.


Pre-markets
 were
 up.
 We
 were
 going


through
 the
 news
 and
 then
 boom,
 Bitcoin


falls
 by
 2,000
 bucks.
 Nvidia's
 down
 2%.


S&P
 is
 down.
 Microsoft's
 down
 3%.
 We're


going
 to
 talk
 about
 why
 that
 happened.


The
 fallout
 from
 what
 happened
 this


morning.
 It
 had
 to
 do
 with
 an
 AI


headline.
 Once
 again,
 the
 fragility
 of


this
 AI
 narrative
 is
 becoming
 more
 and


more
 fragile
 every
 day
 when
 these


headlines
 try
 to
 take
 down
 the


narrative.
 Uh
 even
 if
 there's
 no
 truth


behind
 the
 headline,
 but
 nonetheless,


the
 market
 did
 react
 to
 it.
 So,
 we'll


talk
 about
 that
 today.
 Uh
 Jensen
 Hang


officially
 did
 Joe
 Rogan.
 Did
 not
 expect


to
 see
 that
 today,
 but
 he
 did
 it.
 Jensen


Wong
 did
 two
 and
 a
 half
 hours
 of
 Joe


Rogan.
 Got
 a
 couple
 clips
 that
 I
 think


are
 important
 for
 people
 to
 see.
 So,


we'll
 talk
 about
 that.
 And
 then
 some


macro
 updates.
 We
 got
 some
 Robin
 news,


some
 Tesla
 news,
 some
 political
 stuff


that's
 potentially
 going
 to
 be
 very


beneficial
 to
 Tesla.
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.


Let's
 get
 into
 it.
 So,
 let's
 get
 started


with
 what
 happened
 in
 the
 morning


because
 it
 was
 a
 pretty
 wild
 morning
 on


that
 Microsoft
 headline.
 And
 I
 do
 think


it's
 important
 to
 talk
 about
 because
 the


fragility
 of
 the
 AI
 story
 continues
 to


be
 aggressive
 uh
 simply
 because
 there


are
 more
 and
 more
 people
 that
 are
 scared


that
 we
 are
 in
 some
 type
 of
 an
 AI


bubble.
 And
 the
 only
 way
 to
 combat
 that


is
 for
 companies
 to
 put
 up
 results
 in


earnings
 that
 disprove
 that
 narrative


that
 this
 is
 a
 bubble.
 Nonetheless,
 the


market
 is
 kind
 of
 on
 tilt
 in
 terms
 of


trying
 to
 understand
 if
 it's
 real
 or


not.
 And
 although
 there's
 evidence
 every


single
 day
 that
 it's
 real,
 the
 headlines


that
 can
 come
 out
 can
 deeply
 disturb
 how


the
 market
 is
 thinking
 about
 it.
 And


today
 we
 a
 headline
 for
 Nvidia
 or
 for


Microsoft
 had
 plenty
 of
 headlines
 for


Nvidia.
 Uh
 what
 was
 the
 headline?
 Well,


the
 information
 which
 at
 this
 point


should
 be
 uh
 referred
 to
 as
 the


misinformation.
 I
 do
 not
 know
 how
 this


publication
 has
 this
 much
 influence
 on


the
 markets,
 but
 they
 do.
 Um
 this
 was


the
 original
 quote
 you're
 seeing
 on
 the


lefth
 hand
 side
 of
 screen.
 Microsoft


lowers
 AI
 software
 sales
 quotas
 as


customers
 resist
 newer
 products.
 And
 the


summary
 of
 the
 article,
 like
 literally


the
 one
 sentence
 summary,
 is
 that


customers
 are
 resisting
 signing
 up
 for


co-pilot
 subscriptions.
 Let
 me
 know
 in


the
 comments
 if
 you've
 ever
 used
 Copilot


before.
 Uh
 I've
 never
 worked
 at
 a


corporation
 that
 has
 C-pilot


subscriptions,
 but
 I
 have
 heard
 from


many
 of
 you
 guys
 in
 the
 chat
 every
 day


that
 C-Pilot
 sucks.
 So
 I
 think
 it's
 kind


of,
 you
 know,
 something
 that's
 pretty


wellnown.
 Uh
 and
 then
 after
 Microsoft


came
 out
 and
 explicitly
 said
 that
 we
 are


not
 lowering
 our
 AI
 software


uh
 or
 quote
 targets
 for
 salespeople,


which
 was
 what
 the
 article
 was
 accusing


them
 of.
 This
 is
 the
 exact
 quote.
 The


company's
 not
 lowered
 its
 sales
 quotas


or
 targets
 for
 its
 salespeople.
 Then
 the


information
 came
 out
 and
 they
 changed


the
 headline
 by
 saying
 Microsoft
 lowers


AI
 software
 growth
 targets
 as
 customers


resist
 newer
 products.
 So
 I
 think
 the


real
 thing
 to
 take
 away
 from
 this
 is
 how


scared
 the
 market
 is
 if
 there
 is
 a
 upset


or
 a
 hiccup
 inside
 of
 the
 broader
 AI


narrative.
 This
 source
 that
 they
 used
 to


create
 this
 article
 which
 caused


literally
 hundreds
 of
 billions
 of


dollars
 of
 uh
 market
 cap
 rotation
 during


the
 morning
 had
 two
 sources.
 You
 can
 see


right
 here
 two
 salespeople
 in
 the
 Azure


cloud
 unit.
 It
 is
 rare
 for
 Microsoft
 to


lower
 quotas
 for
 specific
 products.
 The


report
 said
 citing
 two
 salespeople
 in


the
 Azure
 cloud
 unit.
 First
 of
 all,
 if


anyone's
 buying
 Microsoft
 right
 now,


you're
 not
 buying
 it
 for
 co-pilot.
 Like


you're
 buying
 it
 for
 cloud.
 Azure
 is


growing
 at
 40%.
 Microsoft
 AI
 workloads


are
 off
 the
 hook.
 The
 reason
 is
 because


AI
 is
 very
 real
 and
 they're
 getting
 a


lot
 of
 demand
 for
 companies
 that
 want
 to


use
 AI
 enterprise
 workflows
 adoptions.


Obviously,
 that
 needs
 a
 lot
 of
 cloud


computing
 and
 infrastructure
 to
 make


that
 possible.
 That's
 why
 they're


investing
 so
 much
 in
 data
 centers.


That's
 why
 Satia
 is
 putting
 a hundred


billion
 dollars
 in
 capex.
 So
 you
 can


have
 your
 qualms
 about
 the
 model


companies,
 the
 LMS
 of
 the
 world,
 you


know,
 anthropic,
 opening
 eye,
 etc.,


Microsoft
 having
 that
 33%
 stake
 in


opening
 eye,
 but
 you
 cannot
 say
 that
 the


cloud
 isn't
 real,
 that
 the
 demand
 that


Microsoft's
 getting
 from
 cloud
 is
 not


real.
 Now,
 there
 may
 be
 concerns
 about


other
 ways
 for
 Microsoft
 to
 monetize
 AI,


but
 cloud's
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 good
 business,


and
 that's
 growing
 at
 40%
 in
 terms
 of


Azure
 specifically
 year-over-year.
 I


don't
 know
 anyone,
 and
 correct
 me
 if
 I'm


wrong,
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 anyone
 who's


buying
 Microsoft
 stock,
 which
 I
 am


starting
 to
 try
 to
 understand
 a
 lot


more.
 I've
 never
 really
 purchased
 shares


of
 Microsoft.
 Um,
 but
 you
 know,
 given


this
 recent
 sell-off,
 I'm
 trying
 to


understand
 it
 a
 lot
 deeper.
 My
 analysis


from
 the
 elementary
 level
 of
 due


diligence
 I've
 done
 on
 the
 company
 has


not
 come
 down
 to,
 hey,
 Co-Pilot
 is


something
 people
 should
 be
 excited


about.
 And
 to
 my
 understanding,


co-pilot's
 this
 like
 add-on
 subscription


of
 30
 bucks
 a
 month
 that,
 yeah,
 not


every
 enterprise
 is
 going
 to
 want


because
 maybe
 they
 don't
 need
 it.
 In


fact,
 they
 might
 be
 building
 their
 own


in-house
 AI
 tools.
 They
 might
 be
 working


with
 CHATBT
 directly
 or
 Anthropic.
 So,


the
 idea
 that
 the
 AI
 narrative
 is
 gone


or
 it's
 a
 bubble
 or
 it's
 all
 fake


because
 co-pilot,
 which
 is
 a


subscription
 offering
 inside
 of


Microsoft's
 enterprise
 sales,
 isn't


getting
 as
 much
 growth
 as
 people
 thought


it
 would
 get.
 It's
 like,
 okay,
 cool.


Next,
 because
 we
 know
 that
 enterprises


are
 using
 AI.
 We
 know
 that
 they're
 using


cloud.
 For
 cloud,
 they're
 using
 GCP,


Amazon,
 or
 Microsoft.
 So,
 that's
 a


winner.
 And
 we
 know
 that
 that's
 going
 to


be
 continue
 to
 be
 a
 winning
 category.


Maybe
 Microsoft
 doesn't
 win
 in
 copilot.


That
 does
 not
 mean
 AI
 is
 dead.
 That


means
 maybe
 other
 companies
 are


implementing
 these
 AI
 workflows
 to
 allow


them
 to
 get
 better
 use
 cases
 versus
 what


Microsoft
 copilot
 is
 offering.
 So
 I


think
 the
 entire
 story
 today
 if
 anything


it
 should
 be
 a
 reason
 to
 be
 like
 all


right
 Microsoft
 maybe
 should
 deserves
 to


be
 down
 2
 3%
 on
 the
 day
 which
 Microsoft


as
 of
 recording
 this
 is
 down
 1.4%.
 It


was
 down
 3%
 so
 a
 little bit
 of
 recovery


but
 that
 does
 not
 mean
 the
 entire
 market


deserves
 to
 get
 hit.
 And
 you
 got
 the


market
 kind
 of
 recovering
 right
 here.


S&P
 is
 green,
 Nvidia
 is
 green,
 etc.


I
 mean
 it
 is
 another
 argument
 for
 why


people
 are
 scared
 and
 as
 soon
 as
 the


headline
 came
 out
 I
 mean
 we're
 talking


about
 everything
 started
 going
 down.


Bitcoin
 was
 the
 first
 one
 to
 fall
 off.


So
 it
 seems
 like
 the
 NASDAQ
 is
 which
 is


tech
 essentially
 and
 AI
 is
 correlated


with
 crypto
 and
 they're
 going
 back
 and


forth.
 But
 if
 if
 there's
 going
 to
 be a


headline
 to
 take
 this
 down,
 this
 was
 not


the
 headline.
 And
 if
 there
 is
 going to


be another
 headline,
 which
 I'm
 sure


there
 will
 be
 in
 the
 future,
 it's
 very


important
 to
 not
 panic
 when
 this
 stuff


happens
 until
 you
 actually
 have
 some


hard
 set
 of
 data
 that
 shows
 like
 actual


earnings
 data
 that
 shows
 that
 companies


are
 not
 buying
 GPUs,
 companies
 are


taking
 back
 their
 forecast
 for
 earnings,


companies
 are
 not
 knowing
 how
 to


monetize
 AI.
 Like
 we
 need
 real
 hard


proof,
 not
 journalists
 that
 are
 trying


to
 move
 the
 market
 by
 putting
 out
 an


article.
 So
 overall,
 story
 was
 a
 nothing


burger,
 but
 it
 is
 very
 important
 to


understand
 how
 fragile
 the
 AI
 narrative


is
 and
 how
 you're
 going
 to
 need
 a
 lot


more
 earnings
 growth
 to
 continue
 proving


to
 people
 that
 AI
 is
 very
 real.
 All


right,
 next
 up,
 Nvidia.
 Jensen
 did
 it.


Jensen
 did
 it.
 He
 did
 Joe
 Rogan.
 This


was
 super
 exciting
 to
 see.
 Uh,
 there
 you


go.
 Jensen
 and
 Joe
 Rogan.
 There's
 a
 lot


to
 dive
 into.
 A
 lot
 of
 stuff
 was
 said
 in


this
 podcast.
 Nothing
 super
 crazy,
 I


think,
 was
 said.
 I'm
 still
 going
 through


all
 the
 different
 summaries
 of
 what
 I'm


getting,
 but
 I
 mean,
 at
 its
 core,


everything
 that
 Jensen
 has
 said,
 Jensen


has
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 interviews
 over
 the


past
 couple
 years.
 uh
 the
 state
 of


accelerated
 computing.
 Uh
 he
 he


definitely
 gave
 Trump
 a
 lot
 of
 credit


for
 being
 pro-
 energy,
 pro


re-industrialization.
 Said
 that
 energy


was
 the
 bottleneck
 for
 AI.
 Talked
 about


CUDA,
 demand,
 deep
 learning,
 all
 that


stuff.
 So
 I
 so
 far
 have
 not
 seen
 a
 major


takeaway
 that's
 really
 really
 like


necessary
 or
 different
 to
 understand
 as


an
 Nvidia
 shareholder
 if
 you,
 you
 know,


haven't
 already
 heard
 Jensen
 say
 it.
 But


I
 think
 there
 were
 two
 clips.
 One
 is


about
 the
 story
 where
 Jensen
 first
 sold


the
 first
 supercomputer
 to
 Elon
 and
 then


the
 other
 is
 about
 energy
 and
 the
 power


grid.
 So
 I'm
 going
 to
 play
 both
 of
 those


clips
 right
 now.


>> Most
 people
 generally
 as
 a
 country,
 you


know,
 as
 a
 a
 giant
 community,
 which
 we


are,
 it
 just
 only
 makes
 sense
 that
 we


have
 manufacturing
 in
 America
 that


especially
 critical
 technology
 like


you're
 talking
 about.
 Like
 it's
 kind
 of


insane
 that
 we
 buy
 so
 much
 technology


from
 other
 countries.
 If
 United
 States


doesn't
 grow,
 we
 will
 have
 no


prosperity.
 We
 can't
 invest
 in
 anything


domestically
 or
 otherwise.
 We
 can't
 fix


any
 of
 our
 problems.
 If
 we
 don't
 have


energy
 growth,
 we
 can't
 have
 industrial


growth.
 If
 we
 don't
 have
 industrial


growth,
 we
 can't
 have
 job
 growth.
 These


it's
 as
 simple
 as
 that,


>> right?


>> And
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 came


into
 office
 and
 the
 first
 thing
 that
 he


said
 was
 drill
 baby
 drill.
 His
 point
 is


we
 need
 energy
 growth.
 Without
 energy


growth,
 we
 can
 have
 no
 industrial


growth.
 And
 that
 was
 it
 saved
 it
 saved


the
 AI
 industry.
 Got
 I
 got
 to
 tell
 you


flat
 out
 if
 not
 for
 his
 progrowth
 energy


policy.


We
 would
 not
 be
 able
 to
 build
 factories


for
 AI.
 We
 would
 not
 be
 able
 to
 build


chip
 factories.
 We
 won't
 sure
 surely


won't
 be
 able
 to
 build
 supercomputer


factories.
 None
 of
 that
 stuff
 would
 be


possible.
 Without
 all
 of
 that,


construction
 jobs
 would
 be
 challenged,


right?
 Electrical,
 you
 know,
 electrician


jobs,
 all
 of
 these
 jobs
 that
 are
 now


flourishing
 would
 be
 challenged.
 And
 so,


I
 think
 he's
 got
 it
 right.
 We
 need


energy
 growth.
 We
 want
 to


re-industrialize
 the
 United
 States.
 We


need
 to
 be
 back
 in
 manufacturing.
 Every


successful
 person
 doesn't
 need
 to
 have
 a


PhD.
 Every
 successful
 person
 doesn't


have
 to
 have
 gone
 to
 Stanford
 or
 MIT.


And
 I
 think
 I
 think
 that
 that
 that,
 you


know,
 that
 sensibility
 is
 is
 um
 spot
 on.


is
 my
 point.


>> So
 currently
 that
 that
 is
 a
 big


bottleneck,
 right?
 Is
 energy.


>> Yeah,
 it
 is
 the
 bottleneck.


>> The
 bottleneck
 is
 this.
 So
 was
 it
 Google


that
 is
 making
 nuclear
 power
 plants
 to


operate
 one
 of
 its
 AI
 factors?


>> Oh,
 I
 haven't
 heard
 that.
 But
 I
 think
 in


the
 next
 six,
 seven
 years,
 I
 think


you're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of


small
 nuclear
 reactors.


>> And
 by
 small,
 like
 how
 big
 you
 talking


about?


>> Hundreds
 of
 megawws.
 Yeah.


>> Okay.
 And
 that
 these
 will
 be
 local
 to


whatever
 specific
 company
 they
 have.


>> That's
 right.
 We'll
 all
 be
 power


generators.


>> Whoa.


>> You
 know,
 just
 like
 just
 like
 your
 you


know,
 somebody's
 farm.


>> It
 probably
 is
 the
 smartest
 way
 to
 do


it,
 right?


>> And
 it
 takes
 the
 burden
 off
 Yeah.
 takes


the
 burden
 off
 the
 grid.
 It
 takes
 and


you
 could
 build
 as
 much
 as
 you
 need


>> and
 you
 can
 contribute
 back
 to
 the
 grid.


When
 I
 announced
 this
 thing,
 nobody
 in


the
 world
 wanted
 it.
 I
 had
 no
 purchase


orders.
 Not
 not
 one.
 Nobody
 wanted
 to


buy
 it.
 Nobody
 wanted
 to
 be
 part
 of
 it


except
 for
 Elon.
 He
 goes,
 he
 was
 at
 the


event
 and
 we
 were
 doing
 a
 fireside
 chat


about
 the
 future
 of
 self-driving
 cars


and
 he
 goes,
 "You
 know
 what?


I
 have
 a
 company
 that
 could
 really
 use


this."


I
 said,
 "Wow,
 my
 first
 customer."
 And


so,
 so
 I
 was
 pretty
 excited
 about
 it.


And
 he
 goes,
 "Uh,
 yeah.
 Uh,
 we
 have
 this


company.
 It's
 a
 nonprofit
 company


and
 all
 the
 blood
 drained
 out
 of
 my


face.
 I
 just
 spent
 a
 few
 billion
 dollars


building
 this
 thing.
 It
 cost
 $300,000


and
 you
 know
 the
 chances
 of
 a
 nonprofit


being
 able
 to
 pay
 for
 this
 thing
 is


approximately
 zero.
 And
 he
 goes,
 you


know,
 this
 is
 a
 it's
 an
 AI
 company
 and


uh
 it's
 a
 nonprofit
 and
 and
 uh
 we
 could


really
 use
 one
 of
 these
 supercomputers.


And
 so
 I
 I
 picked
 it
 up.
 I
 built
 the


first
 one
 for
 ourselves.
 We're
 using
 it


inside
 the
 company.
 I
 boxed
 one
 up.
 I


drove
 it
 up
 to
 San
 Francisco
 and
 I


delivered
 at
 Elon
 in
 2016
 and
 uh
 I
 walk


up
 to
 the
 second
 floor
 where
 they
 were


all
 kind
 of in
 a
 room.
 This
 smaller
 than


your
 place
 here
 and
 and
 uh
 uh
 that
 place


turned
 out
 to
 have
 been
 open
 AI.


>> It's
 not
 really
 uh
 nonprofit
 anymore


though,
 is
 it?


>> They're
 not
 they're
 not
 nonprofit


anymore.
 Yeah.


>> Weird
 how
 that
 works.
 So
 I
 think
 the


takeaway
 from
 those
 two
 clips
 is
 that


obviously
 Jensen
 is
 making
 the
 continued


argument
 about
 how
 important
 energy
 in


energy
 infrastructure
 is
 as
 an
 ecosystem


to
 be
 able
 to
 develop
 AI
 and
 the
 other


really
 important
 thing
 about
 this
 is


that
 you
 know
 the
 Elon
 story
 I
 thought


was
 fascinating
 because
 now
 people
 can't


wait
 to
 get
 their
 hands
 on
 chips.
 In


fact,
 the
 Morgan
 Sailing
 report
 we


talked
 about
 yesterday
 um
 that
 said
 the


biggest
 concern
 customers
 have
 of
 Nvidia


is
 not
 that
 AI
 is
 a
 bubble,
 but
 that


they
 can't
 get
 their
 hands
 on
 chips
 fast


enough,
 especially
 Vera
 Rubin
 that
 will


be
 launching
 next
 year.


The
 market's
 worried
 about
 a
 bubble.


Customers
 of
 Nvidia
 are
 worried
 about


getting
 chips
 and
 Jensen
 selling
 a
 story


about
 how
 10
 years
 ago
 no
 one
 wanted
 to


buy
 a
 chip.
 Elon,
 you
 know,
 said,
 "Hey,


maybe
 we
 can
 use
 this
 with
 Open
 AI
 at


the
 time."
 So,
 it's
 quite
 incredible
 to


see
 the
 trajectory
 of
 how
 things
 have


changed.
 Uh
 Nvidia
 basically
 flat
 on
 the


day.
 You
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 stocks
 that


are
 moving.
 I
 did
 buy
 more
 Nvidia
 today.


I
 continue
 to
 believe
 that
 the
 market
 is


discounting


Nvidia
 right
 now
 compared
 to
 other


stocks
 and
 other
 valuations
 simply


because
 of
 their
 fear.
 Like
 I
 really


think
 the
 number
 one
 reason
 Nvidia
 is


discounted
 right
 now
 is
 because
 the


market
 is
 afraid
 that
 they're
 missing


something
 to
 the
 story
 because
 if
 not
 I


mean
 objectively
 Nvidia
 should
 be
 closer


to
 200
 right
 now
 at least
 200
 if
 not
 210


215
 and
 and
 that
 would
 not
 be
 a
 euphoric


multiple
 at
 all.
 Get
 to
 300
 or
 like
 but


like
 200
 197
 where
 it
 was
 before


earnings
 is
 not
 crazy.
 It's
 at
 180.
 So


like
 why
 is
 that
 happening?
 I
 think
 it's


because
 the
 market's
 just
 scared
 that
 it


might
 be
 a
 bubble.
 I
 really
 think
 that


which
 is
 ironic
 because
 they're
 you
 know


Nebius
 is
 green
 and
 Cororeweave
 is
 green


and
 Amcor
 which
 is
 a
 supplier
 for


Broadcom
 and
 Nvidia
 that's
 green
 but
 the


company
 that's
 actually
 growing
 faster


than
 all
 those
 other
 companies
 with


ironically
 better
 margins
 even
 though


it's
 a
 hardware
 company
 is
 not
 green.
 So


I
 think
 from
 that
 perspective
 Nvidia


continues
 to
 be
 a
 buy.
 It's
 one
 of
 my


Mac
 7
 buys
 including
 met
 and
 Amazon


going
 into
 2026
 and
 Jensen
 Joe
 Rogan


probably
 introduces
 the
 concept
 of


Nvidia
 which
 you
 know
 quite
 frankly
 a


lot
 of
 people
 don't
 even
 know
 that


Nvidia
 is
 the
 reason
 we
 have
 AI
 like
 my


sister
 the
 other
 day
 had
 no
 idea
 when
 I


was
 talking
 to
 her
 that
 GPUs
 are
 the


reason
 why
 she
 gets
 to
 use
 chat
 and
 so


hopefully
 this
 does
 get
 a
 lot
 more


distribution
 for
 him
 as
 a
 brand
 and
 more


people
 understand
 why
 AI
 is
 possible


it's
 because
 all right
 last
 thing
 we're


going
 to
 get
 into
 is
 some
 of
 the


different
 macro
 headlines
 that
 we
 had


throughout
 the
 entire
 today.
 Uh,
 first


off,
 I
 wanted
 to
 talk
 about
 this.
 I


thought
 this
 was
 pretty
 interesting.
 So,


we've
 talked
 about
 Kevin
 Hasset


potentially
 becoming
 the
 new
 Fed
 chair.


Trump
 kind
 of
 teased
 yesterday
 that


Kevin
 Hasset
 could
 become
 the
 next
 Fed


chair.
 Here's
 a
 report
 that
 I
 thought


was
 pretty
 interesting.
 Bond
 investors


warned
 Treasury
 over
 Hasset
 as
 the
 Fed


chair.
 Bond
 investors
 have
 told
 the
 US


Treasury
 that
 they
 are
 worried
 that


Kevin
 Hassid,
 if
 appointed
 to
 the


Federal
 Reserve
 here
 in
 26,
 would
 cut


interest
 rates
 too
 aggressively
 to


please
 Trump.
 During
 November


consultations
 with
 major
 banks,
 asset


managers,
 and
 the
 Treasury
 Borrowing


Advisory
 Committee,
 several
 market


participants
 said
 they
 preferred
 people


that
 are
 more
 independent
 like
 Rick
 Reer


or
 the
 Fed
 Governor
 Christopher
 Waller.


Investors
 also
 expressed
 doubts
 about


Hasset's
 ability
 to
 lead
 a
 divided
 Fed


board.
 Some
 of
 them
 viewed
 him
 as
 a


Trump
 stoogge,
 risking
 lasting
 damage
 to


the
 Federal
 Reserve's
 credibility.
 I


think
 this
 is
 a
 fair
 argument.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 enough
 of
 an


argument
 to
 cause
 any
 broader
 issues


with
 Kevin
 Hass
 becoming
 the
 next
 Fed


chair
 or
 with,
 you
 know,
 the
 market


being
 upset
 that
 he's
 the
 next
 Fed


chair.
 Yes.
 Will
 will
 there
 be
 some


credibility
 issues
 and
 some
 like
 fears


about
 the
 independence
 of
 the
 Fed?
 Sure.


But
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 like
 this
 is


politics
 and
 every
 administration
 is


going
 to
 have
 their
 own
 picks
 of
 who


they
 want
 to
 serve
 in
 certain


significant
 positions.
 And
 so
 if
 Trump


wants
 lower
 rates
 and
 Kevin
 Hassid
 is


definitely
 going
 to
 lower
 rates,
 maybe


he's
 not
 going to
 be
 as
 independent,
 but


nonetheless,
 he's
 going
 to
 lower
 rates.


And
 the
 market's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 ask


themselves
 a
 question.
 Do
 they
 care
 that


much
 about
 Fed
 independence?
 Do
 they


care
 more
 about
 lowering
 rates?
 Also,


there's
 probably
 a
 bright
 line.
 I
 mean,


if
 it's
 we're
 not
 talking
 about
 100


basis
 points
 on
 day
 one.
 So,
 we're


talking
 about
 something
 that
 can
 be


scaled,
 but
 something
 that
 is
 inevitable


to
 get
 these
 rates
 down
 and
 whatever


other
 dove
 that
 you
 pick
 to
 be
 the
 Fed


chair,
 they
 might
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 more


independent,
 but
 the
 outcome
 might
 be


the
 same.
 The
 Fed
 rate
 cut
 probability,


by
 the
 way,
 went
 up
 to
 89%
 today.
 We
 did


get
 some
 other
 macro
 data
 in
 regards
 to


uh
 ADP
 private
 payrolls,
 which
 came
 in


at
 negative
 32,000
 today.
 Okay,
 the


expectation,
 this
 was
 for
 November,
 was


supposed
 to
 be
 um
 plus
 40,000.
 So
 once


again,
 uh
 we
 don't
 have
 Jolts
 yet.
 We


don't
 have
 the
 jobs
 report
 for
 uh


November.
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 be


getting
 that
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 December


after
 the
 FOMC
 meeting.
 But
 the
 Fed's


got
 to
 cut
 rates.
 And
 I
 think
 this
 ADP


private
 payroll
 number
 today
 kind
 of
 all


but
 confirmed
 that
 it's
 very
 likely


we're
 going to
 be
 getting
 these
 rate


cuts
 because
 you
 just
 cannot
 have
 the


labor
 market
 deteriorating
 the
 way
 it
 is


without
 uh
 the
 Fed
 stepping
 in.
 Now,


American
 Eagle
 Outfitters
 earnings


yesterday
 were
 really
 good.
 They


increased
 guidance
 by
 4x,
 beat
 EPS
 by


20%.
 I'm
 still
 pretty
 confused
 how


Abberrombi,
 Urban
 Outfitters,
 American


Eagle,
 Burlington
 Factory,
 Best
 Buy,
 all


these
 retailers
 are
 putting
 up
 these


monster
 earnings
 numbers
 and
 I'm


supposed
 to
 believe
 the
 consumer
 is


weak.
 Now,
 there's
 tons
 of
 data
 to


explain
 the
 consumer
 is
 weak,
 but
 I'm


trying
 to
 reconcile
 in
 my
 own
 head,
 why


are
 these
 companies
 putting
 up
 really


good
 results
 if
 the
 consumer
 is
 weak?


Why
 are
 they
 shopping
 for
 $85
 jeans?
 Are


we
 just
 having
 middle
 class
 and
 rich


people
 shop
 for
 these
 jeans
 and
 that's


subsidizing
 the
 entire
 economy?
 Maybe.


But
 it's
 hard
 to
 believe
 that
 every


single
 retailer
 that's
 coming
 out,
 the


XRT
 retailer
 ETF
 having
 its
 best
 week
 in


a
 while.
 Um,
 kind
 of
 solidifying
 the


case
 that
 the
 consumer
 might
 not
 be
 as


weak
 as
 expected.
 Now,
 PayPal
 CFO
 did


come
 out
 this
 morning.
 PayPal
 stock
 was


down
 once
 again
 on
 the
 day.
 It
 was
 down


3%.
 It
 continues
 to
 be
 down
 about
 2.4%


on
 the
 day.
 And
 the
 CFO
 said,
 "We
 are


continuing
 to
 see
 weakening
 consumer


dynamics
 from
 September
 to
 October
 to


November."
 Is
 that
 a
 PayPal
 weak


consumer
 where
 people
 are
 using
 Zel
 and


Apple
 Pay
 and
 other
 things
 which
 might


mean
 they're
 not
 as
 weak
 on
 those


platforms?
 They're
 weak
 on
 PayPal.
 Or


are
 the
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 of
 people


that
 use
 PayPal
 every
 month
 showing
 an


aggregate
 trend
 of
 weakness?
 I
 think


it's
 probably
 the
 latter
 versus
 the


former.
 But
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 nuance
 to


this
 because
 then
 you
 have
 other


companies
 showing
 that
 the
 consumer


might
 not
 be
 that
 weak.
 So
 labor
 data
 is


weakening.
 Fed's
 likely
 going
 to
 cut.


Consumers
 weak.
 that
 there's
 a


counternarrative
 to
 this
 consumer
 weak


argument.
 If
 the
 Fed
 cuts
 and
 the


consumer
 ends
 up
 not
 being
 as
 weak
 as


expected,
 although
 we
 do
 know


delinquencies
 are
 rising,
 then
 maybe


that's
 how
 you
 navigate
 2026
 from
 a


macro
 perspective,
 which
 is
 that
 the
 Fed


is
 going
 to
 cut
 rates.
 That's
 going
 to


help
 the
 consumer.
 That's
 going to
 help


the
 labor
 market.
 The
 labor
 market
 still


probably
 is
 not
 the
 best.
 The
 consumer


is
 still
 not
 the
 best,
 but
 those
 rate


cuts
 might
 come
 in.
 And
 if
 the
 consumer


is
 better
 than
 expected,
 the
 obvious


offside
 risk
 to
 that
 is
 inflation


because
 if
 you
 have
 too
 much


consumption,
 then
 inflation
 goes
 up.
 But


if
 AI
 could
 be
 deflationary,
 which
 you


know
 that
 could
 be
 a
 very
 big
 thing
 that


happens,
 this
 is
 whole
 Elon's
 argument


about
 goods
 and
 services
 are
 going
 to
 be


so
 abundant
 that
 the
 cost
 of
 these


things
 are
 going
 to
 come
 down


dramatically.
 Um,
 and
 that
 could
 take


place
 in
 2026.
 That's
 a
 hedge
 against


inflation
 like
 being
 massive.
 And
 then


second
 of
 all,
 it's
 like,
 do
 you
 want
 a


little
 bit
 more
 inflation
 or
 do
 you
 want


a
 horrible
 labor
 market?
 I
 think
 most
 of


us
 would
 say
 we
 want
 a
 little
 bit
 more


inflation.
 So
 maybe
 the
 macro
 is
 not
 as


horrible.
 It's
 definitely
 not
 amazing,


but
 maybe
 it's
 not
 as
 horrible
 as
 a
 lot


of
 people
 were
 thinking.
 And
 you
 know


that
 could
 be
 leading
 to
 a
 little
 bit


more
 momentum
 going
 into
 the
 end
 of


2026.


Next
 thing
 right
 here
 I
 thought
 was


really
 interesting
 as
 well
 is
 the
 Trump


administration
 is
 now
 looking
 to
 robots.


This
 was
 a
 report
 by
 Politico
 this


morning.
 Lutnik
 also
 talked
 about
 this


on
 CNBC
 that
 um
 they
 are
 going
 allin
 on


accelerating
 the
 industry's
 development


in
 terms
 of
 robotics.
 According
 to
 three


people
 familiar
 with
 the
 matter,
 a


spokesperson
 said
 we
 are
 committed
 to


robotics
 and
 advanced
 manufacturing


because
 they
 are
 bringing
 or
 they
 are


central
 to
 bringing
 critical
 production


back
 to
 the
 United
 States.
 The
 really


really
 interesting
 part
 about
 the


robotics
 ecosystem
 is
 essentially
 if
 you


read
 the
 report
 it
 sounds
 like
 they're


saying
 we
 need
 a
 robotic
 zar
 just
 like


we
 have
 the
 aisar
 with
 David
 Saxs
 and


he's
 also
 the
 cryptozar
 if
 you
 have
 a


robotic
 zar
 Tesla
 stock
 was
 I
 think
 is


up
 on
 the
 news
 today
 that
 there
 could
 be


a
 very
 very
 heavy
 focus
 yeah
 446
 on


Tesla
 4%
 of
 the
 day
 there's
 a
 very
 very


heavy
 focus
 on
 the
 industry
 of
 robotics


because
 the
 administration
 understands


that
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 key
 way
 to


grow
 Tesla's
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of


momentum
 from
 that
 because
 if
 you
 have


the
 industry
 or
 the
 government
 ready
 to


propel
 the
 growth
 of
 robotics,
 Tesla's


going
 to
 be a
 winner.
 Amazon's
 going
 to


be
 a
 big
 winner
 as
 well
 because
 robotics


are
 going to
 be
 important
 to
 them
 to


increase
 those
 operating
 margins.
 And
 so


I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 robotics


companies
 or
 just
 like
 the
 AI
 companies


and
 crypto
 companies
 got
 the


administration
 on
 their
 side.
 Robotics


is
 that
 next
 layer
 which
 intersects
 with


AI
 in
 a
 very
 um
 intimate
 way.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 you
 might
 have
 a
 company
 like


Tesla
 and
 Amazon
 really
 benefiting
 from


the
 government
 saying,
 "Hey,
 we're
 going


to
 focus
 heavily
 on
 robots."
 All
 right,


last
 thing
 I
 wanted
 to
 share
 is
 a
 clip


from
 Larry
 Frink
 at
 the
 Dealbook


Conference.
 We're
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 these


clips
 over
 the
 next
 couple
 of
 days
 as
 uh


a
 lot
 more
 of
 these
 clips
 have
 come
 out


and
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 getting


interviewed.
 Bent,
 Alex
 Karp
 was
 there.


Um
 I
 thought
 this
 one
 was
 pretty


interesting.
 Larry
 Frink
 and
 Brian


Armstrong
 discussing
 crypto
 and
 Larry


Frink
 mentions
 that
 um
 he
 was
 wrong
 on


crypto.


>> Uh
 called
 crypto
 an
 index
 for
 money


laundering.
 Uh,
 Black
 Rockck


>> and
 Thieves.


>> And
 thieves.


>> Yes.


>> Money
 laundering
 and
 thieves.


>> Um,
 you
 uh
 now
 have
 the
 biggest
 Bitcoin


ETF.


>> So,
 what
 happened
 here?


>> I
 have
 very
 strong
 views,
 but
 that


doesn't
 mean
 I'm
 not
 wrong.


Uh,
 but
 you
 by
 having
 strong
 views,
 you


have
 to
 test
 yourself
 and
 ask
 yourself.


And,
 you
 know,
 in
 my
 role,
 I
 see,
 you


know,
 thousands
 of
 clients
 a
 year.
 I


have,
 you
 know,
 governmental
 leaders
 and


we
 have
 these
 conversations
 and
 it
 my
 my


thought
 process
 always
 evolves
 and
 this


is
 a
 a
 very
 glaring
 public
 example
 of
 of


a
 a
 big
 shift
 in
 my
 opinion.


>> So
 obviously
 in
 the
 world
 of


tokenization
 and
 as
 tokenization


continues
 to
 expand,
 more
 people
 get


excited
 about
 it.
 You
 see
 Larry
 Fank


from
 Black
 Rockck
 seeing
 this
 like


multi-
 trillion
 dollar
 opportunity.
 That


is
 also
 why
 he
 gets
 more
 excited
 and
 why


he's
 probably
 admitting
 what
 he's


admitting
 about.
 All right,
 that's
 it


for
 me.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for


listening
 and
 watching.
 I
 will
 see
 you


guys
 tomorrow
 on
 another
 episode
 of
 the


daily
 recap.
 And
 more
 and
 more
 we


continue
 to
 see
 how
 the
 world
 of
 AI
 is


intersecting
 with
 a
 variety
 of
 different


verticals
 and
 how
 these
 verticals
 are


also
 fragile
 in
 terms
 of
 their


narrative.
 But
 we're
 going
 to
 keep


updating
 every
 single
 day
 to
 understand


this
 narrative
 as
 we
 go
 forward.
 Thank


you
 everybody
 for
 watching.
 I'll
 see
 you


guys
 on
 the
 next
 one.
