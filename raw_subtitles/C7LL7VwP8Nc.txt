One
 of
 the
 problems
 with
 weight
 loss


goals
 is
 saying
 you
 need
 to
 cut
 calories


in
 order
 to
 get
 there.
 Now,
 I'm
 not


saying
 calories
 don't
 matter.
 They
 are


relevant,
 but
 not
 the
 most
 relevant.
 And


I'm
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 evidence
 to


support
 that.


>> If
 someone
 is
 listening
 at
 home
 now
 and


they
 have
 the
 goal
 of
 losing
 some


weight,
 they
 want
 to
 be
 in
 a
 better


physique,
 be
 more
 healthy.
 Is
 this


conversation
 going
 to
 help
 them


accomplish
 those
 goals?


>> I'll
 make
 sure
 that
 they
 get
 what
 they


need.


>> Dr.
 Benjamin
 Bickman
 is
 one
 of
 the


world's
 leading
 metabolic
 and
 fat
 cell


scientists.
 And
 now
 he's
 returned
 to


expose
 some
 of
 the
 myths
 surrounding


weight
 loss


>> and
 the
 surprising
 impact
 that
 one


particular
 hormone
 has
 on
 our
 weight,


brain,
 and
 mental
 health.


>> As
 a
 metabolic
 scientist,
 I
 wouldn't


want
 someone
 to
 think
 there
 is
 only
 one


way
 to
 lose
 weight.
 However,
 I
 think


this
 is
 the
 most
 practical
 and
 simplest


strategy,
 a
 ketogenic
 diet.
 A
 huge


reason
 is
 that
 when
 you
 cut
 carbs,


insulin
 comes
 down.
 And
 insulin
 as
 a


hormone
 is
 the
 one
 metabolic
 hormone
 to


rule
 them
 all.
 Insulin
 will
 tell
 every


single
 cell
 of
 the
 body
 what
 it
 needs
 to


do
 with
 energy.
 And
 insulin
 is
 so


determined
 to
 store
 energy
 that
 it
 is


directing
 calories
 to
 be
 stored
 in


tissues
 like
 fat
 or
 in
 the
 liver


>> to
 make
 you
 fat.


>> Yeah.
 But
 there's
 more.
 Ketones
 are
 the


brain's
 preferred
 fuel.
 It
 can
 control


anxiety,
 improve
 depression.
 It
 can
 help


with
 attention.
 In
 fact,
 the
 benefits
 of


ketones
 are
 so
 extensive
 that
 companies


are
 finding
 ways
 so
 you
 can
 drink


ketones.


>> And
 I
 have
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


exogenous
 ketone
 products
 here,
 a


variety
 of
 different
 brands
 and
 a
 bunch


of
 other
 things
 here
 on
 the
 table.
 So,


what
 the
 hell
 is
 this?


>> If
 someone
 is
 interested
 in
 a
 good,


smart
 way
 of
 losing
 weight,
 try
 that.


>> This
 is
 definitely
 a
 prop.
 It
 tastes


like
 bleach.


>> I'm
 so
 sorry.
 Oh
 my
 god.


>> So,
 for
 2026
 to
 be
 the
 year
 where
 I


finally
 get
 a
 grip
 of
 my
 health,
 and
 I


asked
 you
 to
 make
 the
 perfect
 plan,
 what


would
 you
 prescribe?


>> So,
 first
 of
 all,


I
 see
 messages
 all
 the
 time
 in
 the


comments
 section
 that
 some
 of
 you
 didn't


realize
 you
 didn't
 subscribe.
 So,
 if
 you


could
 do
 me
 a
 favor
 and
 double
 check
 if


you're
 a
 subscriber
 to
 this
 channel,


that
 would
 be
 tremendously
 appreciated.


It's
 the
 simple,
 it's
 the
 free
 thing


that
 anybody
 that
 watches
 this
 show


frequently
 can
 do
 to
 help
 us
 here
 to


keep
 everything
 going
 in
 this
 show
 in


the
 trajectory
 it's
 on.
 So,
 please
 do


double
 check
 if
 you've
 subscribed
 and
 uh


thank
 you
 so
 much
 because
 in
 a
 strange


way,
 you
 are
 you're
 part
 of
 our
 history


and
 you're
 on
 this
 journey
 with
 us
 and
 I


appreciate
 you
 for
 that.
 So,
 yeah,
 thank


you.


Dr.
 Benjamin
 Bickman,


at
 this
 time
 of
 year,
 the
 audience
 that


are
 listening
 right
 now
 are
 thinking
 a


lot
 about
 health
 and
 dietary
 changes


that
 they
 can
 make
 to
 make
 2026
 the
 best


year
 of
 their
 life
 to
 finally
 be
 able
 to


kick
 that
 habit.
 And
 one
 of the
 things


that's
 front
 of
 mind,
 I
 think,
 for
 all


of
 my
 listeners
 is
 their
 relationship


with
 sugar,
 with
 carbs,


>> right?
 And
 I
 guess
 the
 second
 order


things
 that
 some
 people
 might
 know


something
 about
 like
 insulin
 resistance


and
 all
 these
 kinds
 of
 subjects.
 At
 this


particular
 moment
 in
 the
 year,
 if
 you


had
 the
 ear
 of
 millions
 of
 people
 as


they're
 coming
 into
 2026,
 what
 is
 the


most
 important
 thing
 that
 you
 would
 say


to
 them?


>> Yeah,
 that's
 a
 great
 question.
 What
 a


way
 to
 um
 to
 get
 things
 started.
 In


fact,
 I
 appreciate
 you
 even
 framing
 the


conversation
 as
 if
 I
 had
 the
 ear
 because


you've
 given
 me
 the
 ear
 of
 millions
 of


people.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 take
 it


seriously.
 The
 way
 you
 frame
 the


question
 is
 really
 relevant
 because


within
 North
 America,
 you
 see
 a
 a


pattern,
 a
 rhythm
 to
 both
 weight
 gain


and
 even
 insulin
 resistance
 as
 it
 is


quantified
 throughout
 the
 year
 where
 in


the
 winter
 months
 people
 gain
 more


weight
 and
 are
 more
 insulin
 resistant.


Almost
 like
 the
 hibernating
 bear,
 which


becomes
 demonstrably
 more
 insulin


resistant
 as
 it
 gets
 into
 hibernation.


We
 non-hibernating
 mammals
 actually
 see


an
 echo
 of
 the
 same
 thing,
 albeit
 more


subtly.
 So,
 it
 matters
 now
 where


physiologically
 we're
 more
 inclined
 to


suffer
 from
 the
 consequences
 of
 bad


dietary
 decisions.


And
 of
 course,
 with
 all
 the
 holidays,


we're
 more
 likely
 to
 be
 making
 those
 bad


dietary
 decisions.
 So,
 my
 advice
 would


be
 to
 structure
 your
 indulgences
 as


smartly
 as
 you
 can.
 you
 know
 that
 you're


going
 to
 be
 faced
 with
 foods
 that
 are


delicious
 and
 dare
 I
 say
 addictive.


Don't
 rely
 on
 your
 own
 intuition
 uh
 to


guide
 you
 through
 eating
 that
 know
 that


your
 temptation
 to
 indulge
 is
 going
 to


be
 in
 some
 instances
 perhaps
 greater


than
 you
 can
 control.
 So,
 structure
 your


indulgences.
 Give
 yourself
 a
 distinct


period
 of
 time
 where
 you
 know
 you're


going
 to
 embib
 in
 these
 refined
 starches


and
 sugars.
 And
 then,
 if
 necessary,


recruit
 help.
 Have
 a
 family
 member,
 have


a
 loved
 one
 join
 you
 in
 your
 plan,
 and


you
 tell
 them,
 "I
 don't
 want
 to
 gain
 the


same
 weight
 I
 gained
 last
 year.
 I
 don't


want
 to
 amplify
 the
 consequences
 of


insulin
 resistance
 like
 I
 did
 last
 year.


Can
 you
 please
 be
 my
 my
 watchman
 and


help
 me
 keep
 track
 where
 today
 is
 my
 day


of
 indulgence
 or
 two
 days
 and
 then
 on


that
 Monday
 remind
 me
 please
 be
 my


helper
 um
 to
 get
 back
 on
 track.
 Among


the
 many
 problems
 with
 the
 modern
 diet


is
 the
 constant
 carbohydrate


consumption.
 It
 is
 the
 one
 macronutrient


that
 we
 have
 the
 hardest
 time


controlling
 and
 I
 would
 say
 it's
 the
 one


macronutrient
 that
 has
 the
 most


disastrous
 consequences
 in
 the
 form
 in


which
 we
 consume
 it.
 Now,
 of
 course,


carbohydrates
 is
 a
 broad
 class
 of
 food.


Some
 are
 just
 fine
 and
 some
 are
 not.
 Of


course,
 we
 more
 focus
 on
 the
 ones
 that


are
 not
 fine.
 So,
 my
 advice
 would
 be


structure
 your
 indulgences,
 be
 mindful


of
 what
 you're
 doing
 in
 that
 you
 are
 not


doing
 yourselves
 any
 favor.
 uh
 and
 then


recruit
 outside
 help
 because
 you
 will


not
 be
 able
 to
 rely
 on
 your
 own


intuition
 to
 pull
 you
 out
 of
 what
 might


become
 the
 sort
 of
 carbind
 induced
 coma.


>> Um
 I
 did
 ask
 thousands
 of
 the
 listeners


what
 dietary
 changes
 they
 had
 planned


for
 2026
 and
 what
 they
 cared
 about
 most.


Funnily
 keto
 came
 up
 number
 one
 then


cutting
 sugar
 then
 weight
 loss
 then


fasting
 more
 protein
 whole
 foods
 low


carb
 and
 calorie
 control.
 So
 this
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 road
 map
 for
 me.


I'm
 thrilled
 to
 hear
 that
 order.
 Like


when
 you
 put
 out
 the
 histogram
 and


you're
 looking
 at
 the
 most
 common


responses,
 the
 fact
 that
 calorie
 number


was
 at
 the
 bottom
 actually
 kind
 of


thrills
 me
 because
 this
 reflects
 that


the
 tide
 is
 turning
 that
 over
 the
 past


decades,
 60
 plus
 years,
 the
 singular


piece
 of
 advice
 when
 it
 came
 to
 weight


loss
 and
 metabolic
 health
 was
 eat
 less,


exercise
 more,
 which
 is
 a
 purely


thermodynamic
 or
 a
 a
 calorie
 centric


paradigm.
 just
 stating
 nothing
 else


matters
 other
 than
 the
 energy
 you're


putting
 in
 and
 the
 energy
 you're
 putting


out.
 We
 can't
 possibly
 account
 for
 all


of
 the
 energy
 in
 the
 complexity
 of
 the


human
 body.
 You
 can
 have
 humans
 eat
 two


meals
 that
 are
 identical
 in
 calorie


number.
 So
 purely
 isocaloric


and
 there
 is
 something
 called
 the


thermic
 effect
 of
 food.
 So
 when
 we
 eat


right
 now
 you
 and
 I
 haven't
 eaten,
 we're


in
 a
 fasted
 state.
 Our
 metabolic
 rate
 is


say
 humming
 along
 here.
 If
 we
 were
 to
 go


get
 lunch
 and
 eat
 something
 in
 the
 hours


following
 just
 the
 very
 act
 of
 digesting


we
 have
 turned
 up
 the
 metabolic
 engine


and
 metabolic
 rate
 would
 go
 up
 a
 little


bit.


>> Metabolic
 rate
 meaning


>> meaning
 the
 total
 amount
 of
 energy
 the


body
 is
 is
 expending.
 In
 fact
 metabolism


to
 I'll
 come
 back
 to
 this
 thought
 in


just
 a
 second.
 As
 a
 metabolic
 scientist


people
 don't
 even
 understand
 the
 word


metabolism.
 Metabolism
 is


underwhelmingly
 perhaps
 nothing
 more
 but


nothing
 less
 than
 the
 sum
 of
 every


chemical
 reaction
 happening
 in
 our


bodies.
 It's
 just
 everything
 that
 is


keeping
 us
 alive,
 that
 is
 keeping
 our


neurons
 firing,
 my
 my
 my
 muscles
 moving


as
 I'm
 animating
 on
 the
 my
 hands.


Everything
 we're
 doing
 is
 metabolism.


And
 so
 after
 we
 eat,
 metabolism
 goes
 up


a
 little
 bit.
 Again,
 that's
 called
 the


thermic
 effect
 of
 food.
 And
 if
 you
 give


people
 two
 isocaloric
 meals,
 so
 exact


same
 number
 of
 calories.
 That's
 what


isocaloric
 means.
 same
 amount
 of
 protein


and
 yet
 the
 they
 differ
 in
 their


composition
 of
 macronutrients
 with
 fats


and
 and
 carbs.
 So
 the
 meal
 that
 is
 lower


carb
 and
 higher
 fat,
 those
 individuals


will
 have
 a
 much
 higher
 metabolic
 rate


for
 hours
 afterwards
 than
 the
 group
 that


is
 eating
 the
 high
 carb,
 low-fat
 version


of
 that
 same
 caloric
 meal.
 And
 that's


because
 insulin
 insulin
 as
 a
 hormone
 is


the
 one
 metabolic
 hormone
 to
 rule
 them


all.
 It
 will
 determine
 what
 the
 body


does
 with
 energy
 at
 every
 single
 cell.


This
 is
 a
 principle
 even
 many
 very


educated
 clinicians
 don't
 understand.


They
 think
 that
 insulin
 only
 controls


blood
 glucose.
 That's
 just
 the
 most


obvious
 thing
 that
 it
 does
 because
 we


can
 prick
 a
 finger
 and
 measure
 it
 or


slap
 something
 on
 our
 arm
 and
 measure


the
 glucose.
 Insulin
 will
 tell
 every


single
 cell
 of
 the
 body
 from
 brain
 cells


to
 bone
 cells,
 liver
 cells
 to
 lung


cells,
 and
 everyone
 in
 between
 what
 it


needs
 to
 do
 with
 energy.
 And
 insulin
 is


so
 determined
 to
 store
 energy
 that
 it


will
 slow
 the
 metabolic
 engine
 of
 the


body
 down
 in
 order
 to
 store
 more.
 And
 so


all
 of
 this
 is
 my
 long-
 winded
 way
 of
 of


saying
 how
 thrilled
 I
 am
 that
 this
 is
 an


audience
 that
 is
 shrugging
 off
 the
 old


ideas
 of
 a
 calorie
 ccentric
 model
 of


obesity.
 Because
 all
 of
 these
 people,


everyone's
 interested
 in
 losing
 weight


or
 maintaining
 weight,
 which
 I
 admire.


That's
 a
 good
 goal.
 The
 size
 of
 our
 fat


cells
 matters
 tremendously.
 So
 that's
 a


good
 goal
 to
 want
 to
 shrink
 our
 fat


cells
 and
 be
 healthier.
 The
 fact
 that


they
 didn't
 put
 controlling
 calories
 as


number
 one
 and
 indeed
 put
 it
 at
 the
 end


suggests
 that
 the
 word
 is
 getting
 around


that
 more
 I
 would
 say
 better
 more
 sound


metabolic
 science
 is
 starting
 to
 seep


through
 society
 where
 they're
 more


interested
 in
 controlling
 their


macronutrients.


In
 other
 words,
 their
 carbs
 and
 their


fats
 than
 they
 are
 controlling
 their


calories.


>> My
 brother
 called
 you,
 didn't
 he?


>> He
 did.


>> My
 older
 brother.


>> Yeah.
 What
 did
 he
 say?


>> Yeah,
 he's
 darling.
 Well,
 we
 we
 had
 some


wonderful
 conversations.
 Um,
 he
 was


interested
 as
 a
 dad,
 a
 middle-aged
 dad,


in
 in
 fact
 indeed
 checking
 a
 lot
 of
 the


boxes
 you
 just
 mentioned,
 which
 is
 I


want
 to
 be
 a
 healthy
 dad.
 I
 want
 to
 live


a
 long,
 healthy
 life.
 One
 of
 the


problems
 with
 weight
 loss
 goals
 is
 they


look
 at
 the
 goal.
 They
 look
 at
 the


weight
 where
 they
 want
 to
 get
 to.


They're
 looking
 down
 the
 down
 the
 road


and
 saying,
 "This
 is
 where
 I
 want
 to


get,
 and
 so
 I
 need
 to
 cut
 calories
 in


order
 to
 get
 there."
 So
 there
 are
 two


there
 are
 two
 variables
 that
 come
 into


play
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 losing
 weight.
 And


I've
 already
 said
 said
 this
 and
 I'll


state
 it
 again
 just
 to
 be
 clear.
 It's
 a


matter
 of
 shrinking
 fat
 cells.
 That's


what
 happens
 when
 someone's
 losing
 fat


mass.
 It's
 not
 that
 you're
 losing
 fat


cells.
 Indeed,
 you
 don't
 want
 to.
 That's


a
 topic
 for
 another
 time.
 But


liposuction
 is
 a
 perfect
 example
 where


you
 are
 losing
 fat
 mass
 and
 yet
 no


health
 marker
 gets
 better.
 None.
 Even


though
 you've
 lost,
 you
 could
 go
 in
 and


suck
 out
 fat
 cells
 and
 you'd
 say,
 "I


lost
 20
 pounds
 of
 pure
 fat.
 I'm
 now


going
 to
 go
 to
 my
 doctor
 and
 get
 my


blood
 test
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 so
 much


healthier."
 And
 yet
 nothing
 is


different.
 If
 they
 were
 diabetic,


they're
 just
 as
 diabetic.
 So
 if


someone's
 looking
 at
 their
 New
 Year's


goals,
 and
 when
 I
 spoke
 with
 your


brother,
 it
 was
 an
 echo
 of
 this


conversation
 in
 a
 way.
 I
 said,
 "All


right,
 you
 need
 to
 shrink
 your
 fat


cells."
 Most
 people
 only
 look
 at
 the


calorie
 control.
 The
 problem
 with


calorie
 control
 is
 that
 we've
 seen
 what


it
 looks
 like
 when
 you
 only
 focus
 on


calorie
 deprivation.
 And
 that
 is
 in
 in
 a


word
 hunger.
 And
 there
 was
 this
 within


the
 US
 there's
 been
 this
 game
 show
 over


the
 years
 called
 the
 greatest
 loser.


These
 people
 one
 lose
 a
 fantastic
 amount


of
 weight
 and
 yet
 you
 never
 see
 them


again
 because
 they
 gain
 it
 all
 back.
 So,


if
 your
 weight
 loss
 strategy
 is
 based
 on


cutting
 calories
 without
 addressing


insulin,
 which
 is
 the
 other
 of
 the
 two


variables,
 then
 you're
 going
 to
 be


hungry.
 Dr.
 David
 Lewig
 at
 Harvard,
 a


friend
 and
 colleague
 and
 collaborator,


he
 published
 a
 report
 looking
 at
 the


same
 kind
 of
 dynamic
 that
 I
 outlined
 a


moment
 ago,
 two
 isocaloric
 or
 equal


calorie
 meals.
 And
 he
 found
 that
 when


they
 ate
 the
 meal
 that
 spiked
 insulin,


the
 what
 he
 called
 I
 think
 he
 called
 it


total
 energy
 availability.
 So
 they


measured
 every
 calorie
 molecule
 in
 the


blood.
 So
 ketones,
 you
 know,
 BHB,
 they


measured
 uh
 lactate,
 they
 measured
 fats,


they
 measured
 glucose,
 and
 they
 found


that
 when
 with
 the
 insulin
 spiking
 meal,


the
 total
 energy
 availability
 went
 down.


>> What
 does
 that
 mean?


>> Yeah.
 So
 in
 other
 words,
 with
 the


increase
 in
 insulin,
 as
 I
 noted
 a
 moment


ago,
 insulin
 is
 so
 determined
 to
 store


energy
 that
 it
 is
 directing
 calories
 to


go
 from
 the
 blood
 to
 be
 stored
 in


tissues
 like
 fat
 or
 in
 the
 liver


>> to
 make
 you
 fat.


>> Yeah,
 indeed
 it
 would.
 But
 the
 problem


is
 the
 brain
 doesn't
 have
 that
 storage


capacity.
 You
 know,
 you
 could
 have
 big


fat
 cells
 with
 lots
 of
 energy.
 You
 could


have
 a
 liver
 with
 tons
 of
 fat
 and


glycogen,
 which
 is
 a
 stored
 form
 of


glucose,
 ready
 to
 go,
 but
 the
 brain


doesn't
 have
 a
 big
 storage
 reservoir,


and
 yet
 it
 has
 a
 high
 metabolic
 rate.


And
 so
 the
 brain
 is
 constantly
 relying


on
 the
 energy
 in
 the
 blood
 that
 it
 can


use,
 especially
 glucose
 and
 ketones,
 the


two
 primary
 fuels
 for
 the
 brain.
 And
 so


when
 you
 spike
 insulin,
 you
 lower
 your


glucose
 and
 you
 stop
 your
 liver
 from


making
 ketones.
 So
 the
 two
 main
 brain


fuels
 have
 gone
 down,


>> which
 is
 why
 you
 get
 brain
 fog.


>> It
 certainly
 lead
 to
 some
 mild
 cognitive


impairment,
 but
 it
 would
 also
 drive


hunger.
 And
 so
 another
 group
 found
 that


if
 you
 ate
 an
 isocoric
 breakfast,
 one


low
 carb,
 one
 high
 carb,
 the
 group
 that


was
 on
 the
 high
 carb
 breakfast
 was
 much


hungrier
 much
 sooner.


>> And
 so
 this


>> Okay.
 So
 let
 me
 just


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 The
 way
 I
 understand
 that
 is


>> because
 I've
 had
 a
 meal
 that's
 high
 in


sugar,
 let's
 say,
 or
 carbs.


>> Y


>> insulin
 has
 come
 out,
 it's
 grabbed
 all


of
 the
 energy
 from
 my
 blood.


>> Yep.
 That
 you
 just
 ate.


>> That
 I
 just
 ate.
 It's
 stored
 it
 all


away.
 And
 because
 my
 brain
 is
 getting


its
 energy
 from
 the
 blood
 as
 well,
 my


brain
 is
 being
 energy
 deprived
 in
 some


way.
 And
 so
 my
 brain
 is
 going


>> within
 an
 hour
 or
 two,
 you
 are
 hungry.


>> Yes.
 Even
 though
 your
 fat
 cells
 might
 be


bigger
 than
 they've
 ever
 been.
 So
 that's


the
 sort
 of
 disconnect
 that
 you
 end
 up


having
 when
 you're
 spiking
 insulin
 so


frequently,
 you
 may
 have
 hundreds
 of


thousands
 or
 even
 millions
 of
 calories


stored
 on
 your
 body
 in
 your
 fat
 cells


primarily.
 And
 yet
 the
 brain
 is
 saying,


"I'm
 hungry."
 We
 shouldn't
 be
 hungry.
 We


have
 so
 much
 energy
 that
 we
 can
 use,
 but


only
 if
 we
 can
 access
 it.
 And
 this
 is


where
 ketones
 come
 in.
 And
 I
 hate
 to


change
 the
 topic,
 but
 if
 if
 a
 person
 has


fat
 and
 they
 can
 burn
 that
 fat,
 then


they're
 making
 ketones.
 And
 ketones
 are


the
 brain's
 preferred
 fuel.
 Let's
 just


state
 that
 with
 an
 exclamation
 mark.
 And


so
 if
 the
 brain
 is
 getting
 ketones
 or


even
 if
 it
 has
 access
 to
 plenty
 of


glucose,
 it
 senses,
 hey,
 there's
 no


energy
 deprivation.
 We're
 fine.
 We
 don't


need
 to
 eat.
 And
 that's
 what
 these


studies
 find.
 And
 so
 back
 to
 the


conversation
 with
 your
 brother,
 rather


than
 focusing
 on
 calorie
 number,
 focus


on
 the
 other
 variable,
 which
 is
 insulin.


Because
 if
 you
 decide
 that
 you're
 going


to
 start
 your
 fat
 cell
 shrinking


journey,
 so
 with
 the
 first
 step,
 you


could
 say,
 well,
 my
 first
 step
 is
 going


to
 be
 cutting
 calories.
 But
 if
 you


haven't
 addressed
 your
 high
 insulin,


which
 you
 have
 to
 have
 if
 you've
 gained


weight,
 it
 is
 impossible.


In
 fact,
 this
 is
 worth
 a
 tangent
 for


just
 a
 moment
 because
 I
 can
 state
 this


so
 emphatically.


You
 could
 have
 all
 the
 hormones
 in
 the


human
 body
 and
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of


calories
 coming
 in
 every
 day.
 And
 if
 you


simply
 remove
 one
 single
 hormone,
 it
 is


impossible
 for
 that
 person
 to
 get
 fat.


Totally
 and
 completely
 impossible.
 Now,


I
 am
 a
 scientist
 enough
 that
 I
 like
 to


avoid
 hyperbolic
 language.
 I
 don't
 want


to
 state
 anything
 in
 the
 extreme.
 And


yet,
 in
 this
 case,
 I
 actually
 can.
 I
 can


revel
 in
 all
 of
 the
 um
 the
 power
 of
 this


declaration
 which
 is
 you
 simply
 wipe
 out


a
 person's
 insulin,
 it
 is
 completely


impossible
 for
 them
 to
 get
 fat.
 In
 fact,


this
 phenomenon
 is
 so
 real
 and
 so


learned
 if
 not
 already
 known
 that
 you


have
 people
 with
 type
 1
 diabetes.


Imagine
 the
 temptation.
 Let's
 say
 you're


a
 young
 woman
 who
 faces
 more
 pressure


than
 her
 than
 her
 young
 men


counterparts.
 She
 just
 gets
 diagnosed


with
 type
 1
 diabetes
 and
 she
 has
 become


used
 to
 eating
 whatever
 she
 wants
 and


being
 very
 very
 skinny.
 That
 is
 one
 of


the
 cardinal
 signs
 of
 type
 1
 diabetes.


The
 person
 is
 just
 losing
 weight.
 In


fact,
 the
 early
 the
 ancients
 thought


that
 as
 they
 were
 making
 so
 much
 urine


because
 another
 feature
 of
 type
 1


diabetes
 in
 in
 an
 untreated
 state
 is


they
 urinate
 a
 lot.
 That's
 what
 the
 word


diabetes
 means.
 It
 means
 polyura
 or
 a


lot
 of
 urine
 for
 formation.
 They
 thought


that
 their
 flesh,
 their
 fat,
 their


substance
 was
 turning
 into
 liquid
 and


excreting
 from
 their
 bodies.
 And
 so
 the


person,
 this
 this
 imagine
 this
 young


woman,
 she's
 say
 13
 years
 old.
 She
 is


super
 super
 skinny,
 which
 she
 likes


because
 there's
 such
 a
 pressure
 to
 be


skinny
 and
 she
 can
 also
 at
 the
 same
 time


eat
 whatever
 she
 wants.
 And
 then
 but
 of


course
 she
 feels
 miserable
 and
 indeed
 it


will
 kill
 her.
 So,
 she
 gets
 diagnosed


with
 type
 1
 diabetes
 and
 she's
 put
 on


insulin
 therapy
 and
 two
 things
 happen.


She
 starts
 eating
 less
 and
 getting
 fat.


In
 fact,
 they
 gain
 people
 will
 gain
 so


much
 weight
 that
 if
 they're
 in
 the


hospital
 for
 a
 few
 days,
 they
 can't


leave
 the
 hospital
 with
 the
 same
 clothes


they
 came
 in.
 That's
 not
 to
 say
 they're


leaving
 and
 then
 and
 they're
 obese,
 but


they
 can
 have
 easily
 gained
 10
 pounds,


15
 pounds
 of
 fat.
 So
 this
 phenomenon
 is


known
 and
 you
 have
 people
 with
 type
 1


diabetes
 who
 abuse
 that
 fact
 and
 will


deliberately
 underdose
 their
 insulin.
 So


they
 can
 eat
 whatever
 they
 want.
 They


could
 go
 to
 a
 Thanksgiving
 or
 Christmas


dinner
 and
 indulge
 in
 all
 the
 sweets
 and


just
 simply
 underdose
 their
 insulin
 and


be
 as
 skinny
 as
 they
 want
 to
 be.
 Now


there's
 disastrous
 metabolic


consequences,
 but
 it's
 just
 a
 testament


to
 the
 power
 of
 insulin.
 So
 to
 finally


answer
 the
 question,
 my
 advice
 when
 I


was
 speaking
 with
 your
 brother
 and


anyone
 listening,
 don't
 have
 your
 first


step
 on
 your
 fat
 cell
 shrinking
 journey


be
 low
 calorie
 because
 you
 will
 find


that
 in
 short
 order,
 hunger
 will
 win.


And
 so
 you'll
 be
 right
 back
 where
 you


started.
 Let
 your
 first
 step
 be
 I'm


going
 to
 lower
 my
 insulin
 because
 as
 I


lower
 my
 insulin,
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 worry


about
 hunger
 first
 of
 all.
 Because
 if


you're
 just
 focusing
 on
 lowering


insulin,
 you
 can
 tell
 the
 person,
 and


indeed
 I
 am,
 eat
 as
 much
 protein
 and
 fat


as
 you
 want
 because
 they
 have
 little
 to


no
 effect
 on
 your
 insulin.
 So,
 anytime


you're
 hungry,
 eat
 something
 with


protein
 and
 fat.
 Um,
 and
 then


if
 you're
 not
 hungry,
 don't
 eat.
 But


anytime
 you're
 hungry,
 you
 don't
 have


to,
 it's
 not
 deprivation.
 It's
 not


hunger,
 but
 the
 low
 calorie
 approach
 is


hunger.
 You're
 going
 to
 be
 hungry.
 So


lower
 your
 insulin
 by
 controlling
 your


carbohydrates
 and
 and
 basically
 whole


fruits
 and
 vegetables.
 Enjoy
 them.
 And


this
 is
 part
 of
 the
 conversation
 I
 had


with
 your
 brother.


>> And
 he
 called
 you
 and
 told
 you
 that
 he


had
 had
 positive
 results
 following


watching
 this
 conversation
 and
 following


your
 advice.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 he
 said
 he'd
 effortlessly


lost
 15
 or
 so
 pounds
 uh
 just
 without


even
 really
 worrying
 about
 it
 because


you're
 not
 having
 that
 gnawing
 hunger.


>> Yeah.
 He
 um
 he
 didn't
 tell
 me
 he
 was


reaching
 out
 to
 you.
 So,
 I
 actually
 only


found
 out
 that
 he
 had
 spoken
 to
 you
 when


he
 like
 messaged
 me
 one
 day
 on
 WhatsApp


and
 was
 like,


>> "I've
 been
 chatting
 to
 Dr.
 Benjamin


Bitcoin."
 I
 was
 like, "How
 did
 you
 get


his
 email?
 Like,
 how
 did
 you
 get
 his


phone
 number?"
 So,
 he
 must
 have
 reached


out.


>> He
 knows
 people.


>> Okay.
 Right.
 Okay.
 He
 found
 a
 way.


>> Yeah.
 He
 knows
 people.


>> No,
 but
 he
 looks
 radically
 different.
 I


have
 to
 say
 he
 he's
 dropped
 a
 ton
 of


weight
 and
 um
 looks
 fantastic.


>> Well,
 he
 was
 already
 handsome,
 so
 I
 can


only
 imagine
 what
 he
 looks
 like
 now.


>> That's
 the
 genetic
 component.
 Um
 but
 but


when
 I
 look
 back
 at
 the
 conversation
 we


had


the
 top
 comment
 on
 our
 previous


conversation
 is
 someone
 saying
 I
 was


morbidly
 obese
 68
 days
 ago.
 I
 was
 280


lbs
 and
 pre-diabetic.
 In
 these
 68
 days
 I


cut
 out
 sugar
 and
 flour
 entirely.
 And
 I


reduced
 my
 calories
 to
 about
 1,800
 a


day.
 And
 I'm
 pleased
 to
 know
 that
 my


high
 protein,
 highfat,
 low
 carb
 diet
 is


the
 right
 path
 and
 my
 blood
 sugar
 is
 now


normal.


>> Yeah.
 Remarkable.
 I
 I
 don't
 mean
 to
 ever


come
 across
 as
 saying
 that
 there's
 only


one
 way
 to
 lose
 weight
 and
 that
 anyone


listening
 who
 uh
 is
 interested
 in
 weight


loss
 would
 say,
 "Well,
 gosh,
 it
 looks


like
 I
 have
 to
 eat
 a
 lot
 of
 meat
 and


eggs."
 And
 yet,
 you
 don't.
 As
 much
 as
 I


am
 an
 a
 defender
 of
 that
 view,
 uh
 I


wouldn't
 want
 someone
 to
 think
 there
 is


only
 one
 way
 to
 lose
 weight
 because
 we


could
 both
 think
 of
 people
 who
 adopted
 a


purely
 plant-based
 diet
 and
 lost
 weight.


Now,
 I
 have
 some
 significant
 concerns


with
 that
 diet
 long
 term,
 but
 even


still,
 they
 could
 say,
 "Well,
 I'm
 eating


100%
 carbohydrates
 essentially,
 and
 I've


lost
 weight."
 I'm
 not
 saying
 calories


don't
 matter.
 They
 do.
 But
 it
 also
 makes


it
 a
 hard
 long-term
 strategy.
 And
 so
 if


someone
 can
 lower
 their
 insulin,
 I'
 I'd


alluded
 to
 a
 metabolic
 advantage
 and


I'll
 just
 revisit
 that
 briefly.
 I'd


mentioned
 already
 one
 of
 these
 things,


which
 is
 when
 when
 insulin
 is
 down,
 the


metabolic
 rate
 goes
 up.
 And
 my
 lab


published
 a
 report
 um
 finding
 that
 part


of
 that
 is
 through
 the
 production
 of


ketones.
 That
 when
 ketones
 move
 through


the
 bloodstream
 and
 come
 to
 our
 fat


cells,
 they
 will
 increase
 our
 metabolic


rate
 in
 our
 fat
 tissue
 by
 three
 times.


And
 we
 did
 this
 in
 humans.
 We
 studied


fat
 cells
 in
 a
 petri
 dish.
 We
 studied


fat
 tissue
 from
 animal
 models.
 And
 then


we
 studied
 fat
 tissue
 from
 humans
 where


we
 actually
 were
 pulling
 biopsies
 of


belly
 fat
 from
 people
 that
 were
 in


ketosis
 or
 not.
 And
 when
 they
 were
 in


ketosis,
 their
 metabolic
 rate
 in
 their


fat
 tissue
 was
 three
 times
 higher
 than


when
 they
 weren't
 than
 the
 group
 that


was
 not
 in
 ketosis.
 So
 this
 suggests


that
 there's
 an
 advantage
 here
 that


comes
 from
 lowering
 insulin.
 So
 as


insulin
 comes
 down,
 the
 person
 will
 find


that
 they're
 just
 burning
 weight
 more


easily.
 And
 then
 one
 other
 part
 of
 that


is
 when
 you're
 making
 ketones,


every
 ketone
 has
 a
 caloric
 value
 roughly


similar
 to
 that
 of
 glucose.
 And
 so
 what


happens
 now
 in
 ketosis
 or
 when
 ketones


are
 up,
 you
 start
 wasting
 those
 ketones


from
 your
 body
 that
 you're
 breathing


ketones
 out
 or
 you're
 urinating
 ketones


out.
 And
 those
 are
 calories
 that
 are


just
 coming
 from
 your
 body
 that
 would


have
 had
 to
 be
 burned
 through
 exercise


or
 stored
 in
 fat
 tissue.
 And
 yet
 in
 the


in
 a
 low
 insulin
 state,
 that
 is
 so


antithetical
 to
 fat
 storage
 that
 the


body
 just
 starts
 literally
 wasting


energy.
 So
 every
 breath
 they're
 taking


out
 when
 they're
 breathing
 out
 ketones,


those
 are
 calories
 just
 coming
 out
 of


their
 body.


>> So
 let's
 start
 then
 with
 ketones
 because


on
 the
 list
 of
 things
 that
 my
 audience


said
 they
 planned
 to
 change
 for
 the
 new


year,
 keto


>> Mhm.


>> and
 ketones
 was
 top
 of
 that
 list
 for


someone
 that's,
 you
 know,
 never
 heard


the
 term
 before.


>> Yeah.


>> Um,
 please
 give
 me
 context
 on
 on
 what


exactly
 it
 is,
 but
 also
 how
 it
 relates


to
 living
 a
 healthy,
 happy
 2026.


>> Right.
 Right.
 Well,
 I
 am
 I'm
 a
 great


defender
 of
 ketones.
 I
 think
 that
 they


have
 been
 one
 of
 the
 more
 uh


misunderstood
 molecules
 in
 the
 body
 for


decades
 and
 it
 is
 thrilling
 for
 me
 to


see
 an
 explosion
 of
 research
 in
 this


realm
 looking
 at
 the
 effects
 of
 of


ketones
 in
 the
 body.
 So
 a
 ketone
 is
 a


molecule
 that
 the
 body
 will
 make.
 Um


many
 tissues
 can
 make
 it
 but
 if
 you're


measuring
 it
 in
 your
 blood
 it's
 coming


from
 the
 liver
 and
 ketones
 are
 a
 product


of
 fat
 burning.
 So
 when
 insulin
 is
 low,


which
 it
 must
 be
 for
 the
 body
 to
 make


ketones,
 that's
 why
 it's
 ketogenesis
 or


the
 genesis
 or
 the
 creation
 of
 ketones,


to
 be
 in
 a
 ketogenic
 state,
 you
 must


have
 low
 insulin.
 That's
 required.
 Um,


when
 insulin
 goes
 down,
 you
 have
 two


important
 things
 happening.
 First,


starting
 at
 the
 fat
 cell,
 then
 going
 to


the
 liver.
 When
 insulin
 is
 down,
 the
 fat


cell
 is
 breaking
 apart
 its


triglycerides,
 which
 is
 the
 molecule


that
 the
 fat
 cell
 stores
 as
 fat.
 So


that's
 called
 lipolysis.
 Lipolysis,


lipid
 breaking
 or
 fat
 breaking.
 So
 you


have
 in
 a
 low
 insulin
 state,
 the
 fat


cells
 breaking
 down
 as
 fats.
 Now
 those


fats
 are
 coming
 to
 the
 liver.


>> So
 in
 a
 low
 insulin
 state,
 you
 mean
 if
 I


was
 fasting


>> fasting
 or
 low
 carb?


>> Okay.


>> Yep.


>> So
 the
 minute
 I'm
 low
 carb
 or
 fasting,


then
 I
 start
 producing
 these
 things


called
 ketones.


>> Yeah.
 Within
 about
 16
 hours.
 So
 if
 you


and
 I
 went
 to
 lunch
 and
 we
 ate
 a
 typical


kind
 of
 high
 carb
 type
 lunch,
 a
 typical


lunch
 with
 all
 kinds
 of
 macronutrients


in
 it,
 our
 insulin
 would
 go
 up
 and
 then


if
 we
 stopped
 eating
 then
 about
 16
 or
 so


hours
 later,
 we
 would
 start
 making


ketones.
 That's
 a
 long
 enough
 period
 of


time
 for
 fat
 burning
 to
 kind
 of
 take


over.
 And
 so
 the
 fat
 cell
 is
 breaking


down
 its
 fat.
 That
 fat
 is
 going
 to
 the


liver
 right
 here.
 In
 fact,
 so
 here
 we


don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 subcutaneous
 fat
 on


this
 guy
 here,
 unfortunately.
 So
 on
 the


outside
 in
 the
 front
 of
 the
 body
 or


around
 the
 middle,
 we
 have
 this
 fat
 that


we
 can
 pinch
 and
 jiggle.
 That's
 the


subcutaneous
 fat.
 So
 it
 would
 be


surrounding
 in
 this
 model
 for
 those


watching,
 it'd
 be
 surrounding
 the
 organs


on
 the
 outside.
 That
 is
 fat
 that
 the


body
 burns
 very
 readily.
 That
 fat
 is


running
 to
 the
 liver
 in
 very
 short


order.
 So
 it
 goes
 to
 the
 liver
 and
 now


the
 liver
 has
 some
 options.
 The
 liver
 is


the
 I
 say
 that
 the
 liver
 is
 the
 soccer


mom
 of
 nutrient
 metabolism.
 It
 knows


what
 to
 do
 with
 everything.
 Whether
 it's


lactate
 or
 glucose
 or
 fats
 or
 ketones,


the
 liver
 can
 handle
 all
 of
 them.
 So,


the
 liver
 is
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 fat
 from


fat
 cells.
 And
 it
 has
 some
 options.
 It


would
 say,
 "Well,
 I
 can
 store
 this
 fat


or
 I
 can
 burn
 it."
 And
 and
 how
 does
 the


liver
 decide?
 Insulin
 tells
 it
 what
 to


do.
 And
 if
 insulin
 is
 down,
 the
 liver


cannot
 store
 fat.
 it
 it
 has
 to
 burn
 it.


>> So
 if
 I'm
 fasting,
 if
 I've
 been
 fasting


say
 for
 two
 days
 for
 example
 or
 I've
 not


been
 eating
 carbs
 for
 two
 days,


>> the
 liver
 won't
 store.


>> It
 will
 not.
 In
 fact,
 the
 liver,
 it
 is


so
 antithetical
 to
 fat
 storage
 in
 the


liver
 that
 you
 have
 human
 studies
 where


people
 have
 significant
 fatty
 liver


disease
 confirmed
 through
 ultrasound


measurements
 and
 they
 can
 just
 go
 on
 a


ketogenic
 or
 a
 low
 carb
 diet
 for
 just
 a


week
 and
 if
 I
 recall
 the
 study


correctly,
 I
 think
 it
 reduced
 the
 liver


fat
 by
 like
 60%.
 And
 compared
 and
 which


was
 significantly
 more
 than
 the
 high


carb
 version
 and
 so
 even
 it
 was
 the
 same


calories.
 Once
 again,
 just
 further


evidence
 that
 calorie
 number,
 as
 much
 as


I
 don't
 calories
 matter,
 but
 just


they're
 not
 number
 one.
 They
 they're


they're
 they
 they're
 relevant,
 but
 not


as
 not
 the
 most
 relevant.
 So,
 you
 the


the
 liver
 cannot
 hold
 on
 to
 its
 fat
 as


insulin
 comes
 down.
 It
 must
 burn
 it.
 And


the
 liver
 begins
 within
 each
 liver
 cell,


the
 liver
 is
 burning
 so
 much
 fat
 that


it's
 actually
 it's
 burning
 more
 than
 it


needs
 for
 its
 own
 energy.
 And
 it's


basically,
 if
 you'll
 allow
 me
 to
 speak
 a


little
 silly,
 the
 liver
 begins
 to
 say,


"I'm
 burning
 more
 energy
 than
 I
 need.
 I


wonder
 how
 the
 brain's
 doing."
 And
 the


brain
 won't
 burn
 fat.
 The
 brain
 will


burn
 ketones.
 And
 so
 the
 liver
 starts


creating
 ketones
 is
 as
 its
 it's
 its
 way


of
 sharing
 the
 energy
 with
 the
 brain.
 So


a
 ketone
 is,
 to
 put
 it
 very
 succinctly,


a
 product
 of
 the
 liver
 burning
 a
 lot
 of


fat.
 Anytime
 you're
 burning
 a
 lot
 of


fat,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 making
 ketones.


People
 have
 heard
 of
 the
 keto
 diet.
 Um,


when
 you
 talk
 about
 the
 keto
 diet,


there's
 lots
 of
 rebuttals.


>> Some
 people
 say
 it's
 not
 sustainable.


You
 can't
 do
 it
 for
 a
 long
 period
 of


time.


>> How
 do
 you
 respond
 to
 arguments
 against


keto?


>> Yeah,
 that's
 that's
 a
 great
 question.
 I


appreciate
 the
 concerns.
 The
 the
 stated


concern
 that
 they
 would
 say
 it's
 not


feasible.


You
 can
 say
 that
 about
 any
 diet.
 You


really
 can.
 And
 I
 don't
 mean
 to
 um
 push


aside
 people's
 concerns,
 but
 you
 could


say
 the
 same
 thing
 about
 someone
 going


on
 a
 low-fat,
 lowc
 calorie
 diet.
 That's


not
 sustainable,
 and
 it
 never
 is.
 They


always
 get
 off
 it.
 And
 so,
 anytime
 a


person
 is
 making
 a
 dietary
 change
 to


improve
 their
 metabolic
 health,
 every


diet
 works
 until
 you
 stop
 doing
 it.
 Uh


that
 might
 be
 a
 maxim
 that
 people
 can


leave
 with.
 Um
 a
 ketogenic
 diet
 because


it's
 not
 based
 on
 hunger.
 I
 think
 has


the
 potential
 to
 work.
 But
 we
 know
 there


are
 people
 who've
 done
 it
 their
 whole


lives,
 right?
 There
 are
 people
 who
 from


childhood
 adopt
 a
 ketogenic
 diet
 in


order
 to
 control
 their
 seizures
 or
 their


their
 their
 epilepsy
 or
 people
 will
 do


it
 to
 control
 their
 migraines.
 Because


if
 there's
 one
 tissue
 in
 the
 body
 that


thrives
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 ketones,
 it's


the
 brain.
 you
 can
 almost
 throw
 a
 dart


at
 a
 board
 that
 lists
 all
 of
 these


chronic
 brain
 disorders,
 whether
 it's


schizophrenia,
 whether
 it's
 bipolar,


whether
 it's
 depression,
 whether
 it
 is


um
 dementia,
 like
 Alzheimer's
 disease.


Every
 one
 of
 those
 instances,
 there's


evidence
 to
 show
 even
 things
 like


multiple
 sclerosis.
 There's
 instance


evidence
 to
 show
 improvements
 in
 humans


with
 a
 ketogenic
 diet.
 the
 brain
 and
 to


say
 that
 in
 a
 different
 way
 the
 central


nervous
 system
 loves
 ketones.


>> I'm
 just
 um
 looking
 at
 some
 of
 the


people
 who
 watched
 our
 last
 conversation


and
 who
 have
 left
 comments
 on
 that


conversation
 and
 there's
 this
 one
 chap


here
 who
 I'll
 throw
 up
 on
 the
 screen


called
 Shanti.
 Um
 he
 says
 35
 days
 of


keto
 for
 the
 first
 time
 ever
 started
 on


the
 2nd
 of
 January
 2025.
 It's
 now
 the


8th
 of
 February
 and
 8
 kg
 or
 17.5
 lbs


gone.
 So
 easy
 and
 loving
 my
 food


choices.
 I'm
 having
 no
 more
 than
 20
 gram


of
 carbs
 per
 day.
 I
 am
 amazed.


Not
 felt
 this
 good
 since
 I
 was
 a


teenager.
 Another
 15
 kg
 to
 go
 and
 I
 know


I'll
 get
 there.


>> Wow.


>> That's
 roughly
 37
 pounds
 to
 go.
 So


>> that's
 remarkable.


>> It
 really
 really
 works.


>> Well,
 it
 does
 work.
 But
 but
 I
 don't
 mean


to
 ever,
 you
 know,
 neither
 you
 nor
 I
 are


going
 to
 tell
 anyone
 everyone
 listening


this
 is
 the
 only
 way
 to
 lose
 weight.
 But


I
 think
 it
 is
 the
 most
 practical
 and


simplest
 because
 the
 problem
 with
 so


many
 weight
 loss
 strategies
 is
 that
 it


puts
 you
 against
 your
 own
 hunger.
 And


hunger
 always
 wins.
 You
 have
 to
 have
 a


weight
 loss
 journey
 that
 doesn't
 have


hunger
 being
 a
 constant
 feature.
 Because


if
 you're
 imagining
 this
 long
 walk
 to


shrinking
 my
 fat
 cells
 to
 what
 this
 guy


wanted
 of
 almost
 35
 total
 pounds,
 I


think
 is
 what
 he's
 going
 for.
 If
 you're


carrying
 hunger,
 it's
 like
 it's
 like
 a


bag.
 It's
 like
 luggage
 that
 you're


dragging
 along
 on
 this
 journey.
 The


chains
 that
 you're
 dragging
 that
 are


going
 to
 make
 it
 almost
 impossible
 for


you
 to
 get
 there.


>> This
 sounds
 almost
 counterintuitive


because
 when
 people
 hear
 that
 you're
 not


going
 to
 have
 sugar,
 they
 assume
 that


you're
 therefore
 going
 to
 have
 loads
 of


cravings
 for
 it.
 Mhm.


>> But
 the
 remarkable
 thing
 I
 discovered


the
 first
 time
 I
 went
 on
 a
 low
 carb/


keto
 diet
 is
 I
 was
 walking
 through
 this


mall
 in
 Cape
 Town
 where
 where
 um
 I
 live


sometimes
 and
 I
 saw
 this
 concession


stand
 for
 like
 cinnamon
 rolls.


>> And
 I
 thought
 to
 myself
 like
 I've
 not


had
 sugar
 for,
 you
 know,
 I've
 not
 had
 a


high
 sugar
 diet
 now
 for
 a
 couple
 of


weeks.
 I'll
 just
 go
 look
 at
 it
 and
 see


how
 I
 feel.
 And
 I
 walked
 over
 and
 looked


down
 at
 it
 at
 a
 food
 I
 would
 absolutely


love
 and
 my
 mouth
 would
 water
 just


thinking
 about
 it.
 I
 looked
 down
 at
 it


and
 I
 had
 the
 emotional


urge
 to
 buy
 one
 was
 completely
 gone.
 And


it's
 hard
 to
 explain.


>> It's
 hard
 to
 explain.


>> Yeah.
 You
 you
 were
 able
 to
 just
 look
 at


it
 and
 shrug
 your
 shoulders.


>> I
 felt
 nothing.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> And
 I
 was
 and
 I
 was
 really
 I
 I
 found


that
 really
 fascinating
 that
 I
 had
 no


urge,
 no
 craving,
 no
 desire
 to
 buy
 the


cinnamon
 roll


>> and
 it
 had
 vanished.


>> Well,
 this
 is
 this
 is
 one
 of the
 things


where
 I
 think
 the
 future
 of
 as
 ketone


research
 in
 humans
 continues
 to
 evolve.


I
 there
 is
 already
 evidence
 showing


profound
 you
 can
 use
 a
 ketogenic
 diet
 to


help
 people
 with
 eating
 disorders.
 This


these
 are
 there
 are
 published
 case


studies
 on
 this
 and
 I
 think
 a
 part
 of
 it


is
 when
 the
 brain
 is
 so
 nourished
 and


consistently
 nourished


>> by
 ketones


>> by
 ketones
 the
 brain
 reaches
 this
 new


level
 of
 of
 indifference
 to
 what
 it


knows
 might
 be
 harmful
 and
 and
 that's
 in


the
 midst
 of
 that
 answer
 I
 have
 that's


kind
 of
 loaded
 where
 if
 you're
 on
 a


ketogenic
 diet
 the
 beauty
 is
 fuel
 is


stable
 ketones
 are
 stable
 even
 glucose


is
 stable
 you're
 avoiding
 the
 massive
 um


volatility
 of
 of
 glucose.
 And
 as
 much
 as


so
 much
 of
 of
 the
 glucose
 centric
 view


is
 only
 worried
 about
 the
 high
 glucose,


high
 glucose
 is
 harmful
 that
 it
 can


induce
 the
 glycation
 of
 molecules


throughout
 the
 body
 where
 the
 glucose
 is


literally
 binding
 things
 and
 and


disrupting
 their
 function,
 proteins,


fats.
 So
 glucose
 is
 harmful,
 but
 so
 too


is
 the
 volatility
 of
 the
 glucose
 where


it's
 really
 high,
 then
 it's
 really
 low,


and
 then
 it's
 really
 high
 again.
 That
 is


a
 roller
 coaster
 of
 energy
 for
 the
 brain


where
 it's
 you're
 force-feeding
 the


brain
 all
 this
 glucose
 and
 now
 you're


depriving
 it.
 It's
 like
 it's
 like
 a
 form


of
 abuse
 on
 the
 brain.
 But
 when
 it's
 a


ketogenic
 diet,
 it
 is
 stable,
 consistent


energy.
 And
 so
 it's
 not
 surprising
 to
 me


that
 people
 find
 they're
 able
 to
 resist


cravings
 better
 because
 the
 brain
 is


able
 to
 say
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 body,


"No,
 we
 don't
 need
 that.
 We're
 doing


fine.
 We
 got
 energy."


>> What
 about
 the
 heart?


>> Oh
 my
 gosh,
 that's
 a
 brilliant
 question.


So,
 I
 would
 say
 the
 brain
 is
 number
 one


tissue
 that
 thrives
 on
 ketones
 and
 I'd


put
 actually
 put
 the
 heart
 as
 number


two.
 There
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 great
 research.
 I


would
 refer
 people
 to
 Gary
 Lope's
 work


and
 others
 that
 I
 just
 don't
 know


personally,
 but
 I
 know
 him.
 He's
 at
 the


University
 of
 um
 Alberta
 in
 Edmonton.
 um


and
 he
 has
 found
 and
 others
 so
 I'm
 going


to
 synthesize
 their
 work
 collectively


that
 when
 a
 person's
 experiencing
 heart


failure
 it's
 it's
 a
 combination
 of


variables
 where
 the
 heart
 may
 not
 be


able
 to
 contract
 well
 enough
 to
 eject


the
 blood
 it
 has
 to
 work
 a
 lot
 harder


for
 every
 pump
 in
 that
 case
 they
 they


have
 found
 that
 the
 the
 heart
 will
 shift


its
 fuel
 to
 start
 relying
 on
 ketones
 to


improve
 its
 function
 but
 there
 was
 a


paper
 just
 published
 this
 here
 looking


at
 a
 different
 form
 of
 beta


hydroxybutyrate
 which
 is
 the
 main


ketone.
 Whenever
 I've
 been
 saying


ketone,
 I've
 been
 thinking
 of
 the


molecule
 beta
 hydroxybutyrate.
 When
 the


liver
 makes
 BHB
 or
 beta
 hydroxybutyrate,


it
 actually
 comes
 in
 two
 forms
 that
 are


mirror
 opposites
 of
 each
 other
 in


structure.
 So
 the
 way
 they're
 built,


it's
 referred
 to
 as
 DBHB
 or
 LBH.
 So
 in


heart
 failure,
 the
 heart
 muscle
 itself


like
 the
 brain
 starts
 relying
 a
 lot
 on


DBHB
 as
 its
 fuel.
 Then
 you
 would
 say


that
 begs
 the
 question,
 well
 what
 about


the
 L?
 This
 paper
 that
 was
 just
 found


used
 a
 pig
 heart
 model
 which
 is
 actually


shockingly
 close
 to
 human
 anatomy.
 So


it's
 a
 pretty
 good
 um
 corlary
 here.
 They


found
 that
 with
 LBH
 infused
 into
 the


cardiovascular
 system
 of
 the
 pigs,


>> which
 is
 ketones,


>> which
 is
 a
 different
 form
 of
 the
 ketone


that
 the
 liver
 makes.
 Yeah.
 So
 the
 liver


is
 making
 two
 types
 of
 BHB,
 DBHB
 and


LBHB.


>> And
 when
 they
 profused
 the


cardiovascular
 system
 with
 LBH,
 they


found
 that
 the
 what's
 called
 ejection


fraction,
 so
 the
 amount
 of
 blood
 coming


out
 of
 the
 left
 ventricle,
 which
 is
 the


part
 of
 the
 heart
 that's
 beating
 blood


everywhere.
 So
 with
 LBH,
 they
 found
 that


the
 heart
 was
 able
 to
 eject
 40%
 more


blood
 for
 every
 beat.
 But
 now
 you
 would


say,
 well,
 it's
 just
 because
 you're


making
 the
 heart
 work
 harder.
 No,
 it
 was


not
 at
 all
 an
 effect
 of
 the
 heart


itself.
 It
 was
 because
 all
 of
 the
 great


arteries
 like
 the
 aorta,
 right
 out
 of


the
 left
 ventricle
 will
 come
 the
 aorta,


which
 is
 the
 main
 avenue
 for
 moving


blood
 everywhere.
 The
 aorta
 expanded
 and


all
 of
 the
 great
 vessels
 enlarged
 so


much
 that
 the
 heart
 was
 now
 able
 to
 beat


out
 40%
 more
 blood
 with
 every
 single


beat.
 So
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 someone
 with


heart
 failure,
 I
 think
 they
 are
 among


the
 most
 they
 should
 be
 among
 the
 most


interested
 in
 testing
 out
 the
 effects
 of


ketones.
 Uh
 even
 as
 a
 personal
 note,
 I


am
 I
 tend
 to
 be
 kind
 of
 high
 anxiety,


high
 performance
 sort
 of
 I'm
 always


thinking
 of
 something.
 No
 surprise
 that


I
 tend
 and
 I
 don't
 sleep
 particularly


great
 and
 so
 no
 surprise
 that
 I


sometimes
 have
 higher
 blood
 pressure.
 I


one
 time
 measured
 my
 blood
 pressure
 on
 a


random
 I
 went
 into
 my
 dentist
 and
 the


dentist
 has
 now
 started
 measuring
 blood


pressure.
 It
 was
 139


over
 90ome
 and
 I
 had
 never
 been
 that


high.
 I
 couldn't
 believe
 it.
 I'm
 such
 a


healthy
 bloke.
 How
 on
 earth
 is
 my
 blood


pressure
 this
 high?
 And
 I
 thought,
 well,


I'm
 kind
 of
 sleepd
 deprived.
 I've
 had


maybe
 a
 little
 too
 much
 caffeine
 that


morning
 or
 whatever.
 But
 it
 was
 a


concern.
 And
 over
 the
 next
 few
 days,
 my


blood
 pressure
 continued
 to
 be
 higher


than
 it
 had
 ever
 been.
 And
 of
 course,


I'm
 getting
 old
 enough
 that
 I
 think


these
 things
 start
 to
 matter.
 I
 took
 a


shot
 of
 as
 an
 experiment,
 seeing
 this


paper
 that
 was
 had
 just
 been
 published


in
 2025.
 I
 took
 a
 few
 grams
 worth
 of


LBH.
 I
 drank
 it
 and
 within
 about
 an


hour,
 my
 blood
 pressure
 was
 like
 110


over
 70.
 So,
 it
 had
 this.
 Now,
 that's


anecdotal.
 It's
 an
 N
 of
 one.
 Maybe
 I


just
 calmed
 down
 enough,
 but
 I
 saw
 an


almost
 immediate
 reduction
 in
 my
 blood


pressure.
 And
 it
 could
 be
 because
 of


what
 they
 found,
 which
 is
 that
 all
 of


the
 vessels
 that
 the
 heart
 is
 beating


into,
 they
 expanded.
 And
 so
 every
 with


every
 beat
 of
 the
 heart,
 the
 heart
 was


able
 to
 eject
 more
 blood.
 And
 the
 and


the
 the
 wider
 a
 blood
 vessel
 gets,
 of


course,
 the
 lower
 the
 pressure
 is.
 And


so
 that's
 that
 could
 be
 the
 mechanism


that
 explains
 in
 my
 case
 why
 my
 blood


pressure
 got
 fixed
 so
 quickly.
 How
 did


you
 drink
 that?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 there
 are
 a
 few


different
 ways.
 As
 much
 as
 we've
 been


focusing
 on
 uh
 endogenous
 ketones.
 So,


I'm
 pointing
 to
 my
 liver,
 but
 here's
 the


liver.
 So,
 when
 a
 person
 is
 in
 a


ketogenic
 state,
 they're
 making
 their


own
 ketones,
 we
 would
 use
 the
 word


endogenous
 ketogenesis
 or
 they're
 making


ketones
 in
 their
 own
 body.
 But
 it's
 no


surprise
 that
 the
 benefits
 of
 ketones


are
 getting
 so
 extensive
 that
 now
 there


are
 companies
 um
 that
 are
 enterprising


individuals
 that
 are
 finding
 ways
 to
 get


into
 ketosis
 without
 having
 the
 rigor
 of


a
 ketogenic
 diet.
 And
 so
 you
 can
 drink


ketones.
 And
 that
 comes
 in
 a
 few


different
 forms.
 Of
 course,
 the
 form
 I'm


talking
 about
 is
 just
 straight
 BHB
 in
 in


its
 two
 in
 its
 two
 versions.
 You
 can
 get


it
 in
 either
 version,
 DBHB
 or
 LBH.


So,
 that's
 just
 you
 consuming
 it
 in
 the


way
 your
 liver
 makes
 it.


>> If
 you
 looked
 in
 my
 kitchen
 cupboard


over
 there,
 you'd
 probably
 see,
 frankly,


about
 100
 different
 ketone
 products.
 Um,


obviously,
 some
 of
 them
 are
 the
 same,


but
 there's
 like
 100
 different
 units
 of


ketone
 products.
 And
 here
 is
 my
 ketone


reader,
 which
 is
 where
 I
 pick
 prick
 my


finger
 frequently.


>> In
 fact,
 you'll
 be
 delighted
 um
 once
 you


get
 one.
 Nowadays,
 they
 make
 them


attachable.


>> Really?


>> Yeah.
 So
 ketones
 are
 so
 easy
 to
 measure,


not
 unlike
 glucose,
 that
 just
 like


people
 have
 continuous
 glucose
 monitors


now
 in
 Europe,
 you
 can
 get
 continuous


ketone
 monitors


>> from
 where?


>> Next
 time
 you're
 in
 the
 UK,
 get
 them.


You
 can't
 get
 them
 here
 yet.
 They're
 not


FDA
 approved,
 but
 there
 was
 a
 company


out
 of
 Germany
 um
 that
 sent
 me
 one
 uh


called
 Sai
 Bio,
 Si
 Bio,
 and
 you
 can
 just


strap
 it
 on
 and
 look
 at
 your
 phone
 and


it's
 giving
 you
 continuous
 readings.


>> Damn.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 very
 very


>> That
 is
 incredible.
 I'm
 literally
 going


to
 buy
 that
 ASAP.
 Um,
 but
 before
 I
 get


that,
 I've
 been
 using
 this
 little
 ketone


reader
 here.


>> Yep.


>> Which
 I
 have
 no
 affiliation
 to
 at
 all.


Um,
 and
 pricking
 my
 finger
 every
 single


day
 to
 see
 my
 ketone
 levels
 when
 I'm
 in


a
 in
 a
 ketogenic
 state.


>> You
 talked
 about
 exogenous
 ketones


there.
 I
 have
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


exogenous
 ketone
 products
 here.
 I
 know


some
 people
 use
 ketone
 salts.


>> Yep.


>> I
 have
 two
 different
 ketone
 brands
 here.


>> Yes.
 Yeah.
 So,
 there
 are
 there
 are


different
 forms.
 You
 have
 two
 different


forms
 here.
 and
 you
 mentioned
 one
 that


that
 ought
 to
 be
 described
 because
 that


actually
 is
 the
 type
 of
 ketone
 I
 was


just
 talking
 about.
 So
 ketone
 IQ
 is
 a


ketone
 precursor
 where
 it's
 a
 molecule


called
 13b
 butane
 dial
 that
 will
 come
 to


the
 liver
 then
 the
 liver
 will
 metabolize


it
 um
 to
 to
 a
 large
 degree
 into
 BHB
 the


main
 ketone
 that
 we're
 talking
 about
 and


that
 is
 the
 ketone
 that
 people
 want.
 Um


then
 the
 other
 one,
 this
 is
 an
 esther.


What's
 an
 esther
 bond
 is
 a
 molecule
 that


has
 a
 a
 a
 chemical
 bond
 that
 is
 broken


when
 you
 eat
 it
 uh
 through
 enzymes.
 So


you
 digest
 that
 where
 it's
 one
 part
 BHB,


the
 straight
 real
 ketone,
 and
 then
 it's


one
 part
 13
 butane
 dial,
 which
 is
 the


same
 precursor,
 the
 ketone
 precursor
 and


ketone
 IQ.
 And
 so
 those
 are
 two
 of
 the


three
 forms,
 well
 maybe
 four
 forms.
 And


then
 the
 other
 two
 are
 straight
 BHB


where
 it's
 either
 a
 BHB
 salt
 where
 the


BHB
 molecule
 is
 bound
 to
 a
 sodium
 or
 a


calcium
 or
 a
 potassium.
 And
 you
 can
 buy


those
 in
 the
 D
 or
 the
 L
 form
 or
 nowadays


it's
 the
 straight
 acid
 what's
 called
 a


BHB
 acid
 where
 it
 doesn't
 have
 any
 of


the
 electrolytes
 in
 it
 where
 it's
 you


can
 get
 that's
 what
 I
 was
 referring
 to
 a


moment
 ago
 when
 I
 lowered
 my
 blood


pressure.
 I
 took
 the
 straight
 a
 straight


shot
 of
 L
 BHB
 and
 you
 can
 get
 that
 in
 D


and
 L
 forms
 as
 well.


>> Okay.
 So,
 I've
 just
 taken
 a
 shot
 of


Keton
 IQ.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 that's
 one3
 butane
 dial
 and


you
 taste
 it.
 Um,
 right.
 It
 has
 a


particular
 kind
 of
 kick
 because
 it's
 a


it's
 an
 alcohol
 molecule
 that
 you
 know,


you
 feel
 it
 like
 it
 it's
 sort
 of
 like


taking
 a
 little
 shot,
 but
 your
 liver


will
 take
 that
 in
 and
 then
 over
 the
 next


couple
 hours
 it
 will
 start
 converting
 it


to
 varying
 degrees
 into
 BHB.
 And
 what


I'm
 going
 to
 do
 is
 I'm
 going
 to
 quickly


do
 my
 blood
 ketone
 levels
 now
 and
 we


will
 see
 if
 in
 10
 minutes
 time,
 let's
 do


10
 20
 minutes
 time,
 there
 are
 ketones


flowing
 in
 my
 blood.
 So
 I've
 pricricked


my
 finger.
 I've
 put
 a
 little
 bit
 of


blood
 on
 this
 little
 ketone
 sensor
 here


and
 it
 says
 that
 my
 blood
 ketone
 levels


are
 currently
 0.3.


>> Yep.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 can
 you
 describe
 for
 me
 now
 that
 I've


just
 have
 had
 a
 shot
 of
 Ketone
 IQ,
 which


by
 the
 way
 I
 am
 affiliated
 with.
 I
 have


um
 I'm
 an
 investor
 in
 the
 company.
 Um


but
 that's
 why
 I
 brought
 a
 variety
 of


different
 brands.
 Yeah.


>> Um
 can
 you
 tell
 me
 what's
 going
 on


inside
 my
 body
 now
 that
 I've
 just
 had


one
 shot
 of
 that?


>> Yes.
 Yes.
 So
 now
 your
 body
 is
 taking
 in


that
 main
 molecule
 of
 ketone
 IQ
 which
 is


called
 13
 butane
 dol
 and
 it's
 going
 to


get
 absorbed
 from
 your
 guts
 into
 your


blood
 and
 then
 from
 your
 guts
 it's
 going


to
 go
 to
 your
 liver
 and
 then
 the
 liver


will
 pull
 in
 that
 molecule
 and
 rearrange


it
 into
 BHB
 and
 then
 and
 then
 release


that
 into
 the
 into
 the
 blood


>> which
 is
 ketones


>> which
 is
 key
 it
 will
 turn
 it
 into
 BHB


the
 ketone.
 Yep.
 And
 now
 again
 there
 are


different
 forms
 that
 you
 can
 take


whether
 it's
 the
 straight
 13b
 butane


dial
 or
 whether
 it's
 an
 esther


>> and
 what's
 happening
 from
 there.
 So
 it's


now
 in
 my
 blood.
 What's
 happening
 then?


>> Yeah.
 So
 now
 once
 the
 BHB
 is
 in
 the


blood
 it
 um
 anytime
 BHB
 is
 in
 the
 blood


it
 is
 both
 fuel
 and
 a
 signaling


molecule.
 And
 that
 last
 part
 is
 often


overlooked.
 We've
 been
 over
 the
 course


of
 this
 discussion
 talking
 a
 lot
 about


or
 I've
 been
 referring
 to
 the
 fact
 that


it's
 a
 fuel
 for
 any
 any
 cell
 with


mitochondria,


which
 is
 everything
 but
 red
 blood
 cells.


Red
 blood
 cells
 are
 the
 only
 cells
 with


no
 mitochondria.
 But
 every
 other
 cell
 of


the
 body
 will
 take
 in
 BHB,
 the
 main


ketone,
 and
 use
 it
 for
 fuel.
 Every


single
 cell
 of
 the
 body,
 and
 do
 so


gladly.
 the
 and
 it's
 important
 to


compare
 the
 BHB
 the
 ketone
 against


glucose
 in
 many
 of
 the
 biggest
 tissues


of
 the
 body
 like
 the
 muscle
 or
 the
 fat


or
 even
 the
 heart
 glucose
 can't
 just


come
 in
 it
 needs
 an
 escort
 if
 you
 will


or
 it
 needs
 permission
 and
 that's


insulin
 so
 there's
 this
 regulating
 step


there's
 this
 this
 checkpoint
 where


insulin
 can
 say
 all
 right
 you
 can
 come


in
 or
 not
 because
 I'm
 insulin
 resistant


or
 there's
 not
 enough
 insulin
 or


whatever
 ketones
 have
 no
 such
 regulation


they
 just
 come
 in
 if
 the
 cell
 has
 mito


mitochondria,
 the
 ketones
 going
 in.
 So


that's
 one
 effect
 where
 the
 ketone
 is


metabolized
 as
 a
 fuel
 giving
 the
 cell


literal
 energy.
 Number
 two
 is
 the
 fact


that
 the
 BHB
 can
 bind
 to
 the
 cell
 and


there
 are
 receptors
 on
 cells
 that
 will


sense
 the
 BHB
 then
 the
 BHB
 will
 tell
 it


to
 do
 something.


>> The
 ketone.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So
 it's
 it's
 which
 is
 really


really
 unique
 where
 you
 have
 something


that
 is
 both
 a
 calorie
 source
 an
 energy


source
 and
 it
 acts
 like
 a
 hormone
 where


it
 tells
 cells
 that's
 the
 signaling


effect
 where
 it
 tells
 cells
 to
 to
 do


something
 like
 a
 moment
 ago
 I'd


mentioned
 how
 LBH
 is
 capable
 of


expanding
 the
 great
 blood
 vessels
 in
 the


body
 well
 in
 that
 regard
 it's
 acting
 as


a
 signaling
 molecule
 and
 increasing
 the


production
 of
 nitric
 oxide
 which
 is
 a


great
 visodilator.
 All
 these
 guys
 that


are
 taking
 nitric
 oxide
 drugs
 like


Seialis
 for
 whether
 it's
 erectile


function
 or
 nowadays
 guys
 are
 taking
 it


to
 have
 better
 blood
 flow
 and
 perform
 in


the
 gym
 and
 have
 a
 better
 workout.
 Well,


LBHB
 might
 be
 kind
 of
 the
 way
 forward


where
 if
 you
 can
 signal
 something
 else


but
 get
 the
 same
 effect
 without
 the


consequences
 or
 the
 side
 effects
 that


you
 get
 from
 seialis
 then
 that
 might
 be


one
 of
 the
 strategies
 and
 use
 of
 LBH
 in


the
 future.
 So,
 that's
 been
 about
 5
 or


10
 minutes
 and
 my
 blood
 ketone
 levels


are
 now
 at
 0.5.
 Um,
 and
 they're


continuing
 to
 climb
 just
 from
 one
 shot


of
 Keton
 IQ.
 Some
 people
 ask
 me
 about


sex
 differences
 in
 the
 ketogenic
 diet
 or


a
 low
 carb
 diet
 generally.


>> Some
 people
 are
 concerned
 that
 low
 carb


diets
 or
 ketogenic
 diets
 are
 especially


useful
 for
 men
 but
 might
 have
 a


different
 set
 of
 complications
 for


women.
 And
 we
 did
 have
 a
 female
 expert


debate
 on
 the
 show
 where
 I
 asked
 about


the
 ketogenic
 diet
 for
 women
 and
 the


sort
 of
 consensus
 was
 that
 it
 should
 be


treated
 differently
 for
 women.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 app
 I
 remember
 I
 I
 tuned


into
 that
 and
 I
 respect
 it
 tremendously.


I
 I
 really
 appreciate
 the
 view
 that
 a


lot
 of
 these
 gals
 have
 advocated
 for


which
 is
 that
 women
 are
 not
 just
 small


men.
 The
 differences
 between
 male
 and


female
 of
 course
 are
 enormous.
 Um
 that


doesn't
 mean
 there
 are
 differences
 in


everything.
 So
 women
 are
 very
 unique


when
 it
 comes
 to
 hormones.
 They
 women


experience
 a
 rhythm
 of
 hormones
 that


there
 is
 no
 equivalent
 in
 men
 because
 of


the
 the
 reproductive
 burden
 if
 you
 will


or
 responsibility
 that
 a
 woman
 has
 where


she
 will
 see
 changes
 in
 hormones
 that


can
 reach
 thousands
 of
 times
 differences


like
 progesterone
 levels
 can
 change
 by
 a


thousand
 times
 over
 the
 course
 of
 the


ovarian
 cycle.
 Estrogen
 levels
 will


change
 by
 multiples.
 men
 just
 don't
 have


that
 kind
 of
 volatility.
 Those
 female


sex
 hormones
 do
 influence
 metabolism,


but
 then
 it
 matters
 tremendously
 which


um
 phase
 she
 is
 in
 of
 her
 ovarian
 cycle.


So
 if
 she
 is
 in
 the
 the
 first
 follicular


phase,
 which
 is
 a
 low
 progesterone,


higher
 estrogen
 state,


>> what's
 the
 first
 follicular
 phase?


>> Yeah.
 So
 in
 the
 in
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


female
 fertility
 phase,
 um
 it
 is
 like
 a


200piece
 orchestra.
 It
 is
 so
 dynamic.


Whereas
 men's
 fertility
 is
 like
 a


barberhop
 quartet.
 It
 sounds
 nice,
 but


it's
 very
 simple.
 So,
 in
 the
 first
 phase


leading
 up,
 so
 she's
 just
 had
 her


menration
 end,
 now
 she's
 starting
 the


beginning
 of
 a
 new
 cycle.
 That
 first


phase
 is
 called
 the
 follicular
 phase,


which
 is
 when
 her
 ovaries
 are
 having


some
 follicles
 or
 a
 future
 a
 little
 egg


getting
 bigger.
 One
 will
 end
 up
 becoming


the
 dominant
 one,
 but
 that
 is
 creeping


in
 higher
 higher
 levels
 of
 estrogen.
 And


then
 she
 will
 ovulate
 with
 at
 with
 the


ovulation
 that
 what
 was
 a
 follicle
 in


her
 ovary
 now
 becomes
 what's
 called
 a


yellow
 body
 or
 a
 corpus
 ludium.
 And
 so


it's
 called
 the
 ludial
 phase
 and
 that
 is


defined
 by
 very
 high
 progesterone
 and


progesterone
 changes
 things.
 So
 where
 I


think
 the
 conversation
 in
 women
 is
 very


relevant
 and
 fascinating
 is
 that
 in
 the


first
 phase
 in
 her
 follicular
 phase
 she


is
 a
 fat
 burning
 machine.
 You
 can


measure
 she
 will
 get
 into
 ketosis
 faster


than
 her
 male
 counterpart
 and
 she's


burning
 more
 fat
 than
 her
 male


counterpart.
 In
 fact,
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the


few
 clinical
 values
 where
 there's
 a
 male


version
 and
 a
 female
 version.
 This
 isn't


very
 common.
 Many
 of
 the
 typical


metabolic
 type
 markers,
 whether
 it's


glucose
 or
 insulin,
 triglycerides,
 LDL,


cholesterol,
 they're
 the
 same
 across
 the


sexes
 with
 the
 exception
 of
 free
 fatty


acids.
 So
 earlier
 I
 had
 mentioned
 that


when
 insulin
 is
 low
 the
 li
 the
 fat
 cell


is
 breaking
 down
 fat.
 It's
 breaking
 down


that
 fat
 as
 free
 fatty
 acids.
 So
 the


free
 fatty
 acids
 in
 a
 woman
 are
 about
 40


or
 50%
 higher
 than
 in
 a
 man


>> during
 that
 first
 phase.


>> Yes.
 Especially
 during
 the
 first
 phase


and
 that's
 because
 she's
 burning
 more


fat
 and
 that
 helps
 her
 get
 into
 ketosis


faster.
 So
 if
 you
 this
 has
 been
 shown
 in


studies
 take
 a
 male
 and
 female
 have
 them


start
 a
 fast
 she
 will
 get
 into
 ketosis


faster
 than
 him.


Now
 during
 during


>> just
 during
 that
 phase
 or


>> especially
 during
 the
 phase
 yeah
 I
 I


don't
 know
 that
 they
 compared
 and


controlled
 for
 the
 ludial
 phase
 but
 it's


worth
 noting
 where
 I
 think
 um
 fasting


and
 ketogenic
 diets
 start
 to
 change.


So
 it'll
 keep
 going
 up.
 Yeah.


>> So
 just
 another
 reading
 point8.


>> Yep.


>> Is
 ketosis
 considered
 what.5?


>> Technically,
 but
 frankly
 I
 actually
 call


it
 ketosis
 at.3.
 the
 moment
 you
 can


detect
 it
 on
 one
 of
 those
 blood
 meters


that
 I'd
 say
 you're
 in
 ketosis
 and
 I


think
 0.3
 is
 the
 lower
 limit.
 So
 0.5
 is


a
 little
 bit
 of
 an
 arbitrary
 cut
 off
 but


that
 is
 the
 classic
 view.
 Um,
 so
 in
 in


that
 in
 that
 ludal
 phase
 with
 high


progesterone,
 progesterone
 is
 a
 hunger


hormone.
 And
 so
 if
 she's
 trying
 to
 do
 a


fasting
 protocol
 during
 and
 her
 cravings


are
 going to
 be
 higher
 and
 her
 uh
 she's


going
 to
 be
 hungrier.
 And
 so
 that's


where
 I
 think
 the
 conversation's
 very


important
 is
 that
 during
 her
 ludal
 phase


after
 she
 has
 ovulated,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 harder
 to
 stick
 to
 a


ketogenic
 diet.
 And
 that's
 where
 I
 think


it
 might
 be
 prudent
 for
 her
 to
 be
 a


little
 generous
 with
 herself.
 um
 where


uh
 it
 might
 get
 a
 little
 more
 difficult.


Now,
 however,
 some
 of
 the
 concern
 with


women
 and
 ketogenic
 diets
 is
 misplaced.


And
 I
 would
 be
 remiss
 if
 I
 didn't


mention
 a
 study
 that
 answered
 this


question
 very
 well
 in
 with
 regards
 to


cortisol.
 In
 fact,
 I'll
 state
 this
 now.


I
 already
 chatted
 with
 the
 team.
 I
 would


love
 to
 see
 you
 bring
 on
 a
 scientist
 in


the
 UK
 named
 Dr.
 Isabella
 Cooper.
 She


has
 published
 a
 series
 of
 studies
 in


women
 that
 are
 fascinating
 because
 of


the
 the
 intervention
 that
 she's
 done.


She's
 taken
 women
 who
 had
 been
 adhering


to
 a
 ketogenic
 diet
 as
 part
 of
 their


normal
 life.
 Then
 for
 21
 days
 they
 have


to
 adopt
 the
 typical
 high
 carb
 diet
 of


the
 standard
 UK
 guidelines
 similar
 to


the
 US
 about
 55%
 carbohydrate
 decidedly


not
 ketogenic
 for
 21
 days.
 So
 more
 than


long
 enough
 to
 detect
 changes
 and
 then


they
 go
 back
 to
 their
 diet
 for
 21
 days


and
 they
 have
 blood
 tests
 again.
 And
 so


these
 are
 healthy
 women
 who
 go
 from
 a


ketogenic
 diet
 to
 a
 high
 carb
 diet
 back


to
 a
 ketogenic
 diet.
 And
 when
 they


looked
 at
 cortisol,
 when
 Isabella
 and


her
 group
 measured
 cortisol
 levels,
 no


statistically
 significant
 change
 at
 any


point.
 There
 was
 just
 noise
 and
 no


trend.
 Some
 gals
 had
 their
 cortisol
 go


down.
 Some
 had
 them
 go
 up.
 But
 as
 a


group
 there
 was
 it
 was
 just
 a
 big
 messy


flat
 line.


>> And
 what
 does
 that
 mean?


>> That
 takes
 a
 lot
 of
 wind
 out
 of
 the


sales
 of
 of
 people
 who
 say
 that
 a


ketogenic
 diet
 is
 a
 unique
 stress
 on


women
 because
 people
 want
 to
 invoke
 and


they'll
 say,
 "Well,
 cortisol
 goes


through
 the
 roof
 and
 that's
 sign
 of
 a


significant
 stress."
 And
 yet
 Isabella's


own
 data
 show
 that
 cortisol
 levels


aren't
 different.
 that
 there
 is
 no


unique
 cortisol
 related
 stress
 state
 of


a
 ketogenic
 diet.
 So
 I
 think
 it's


relevant
 because
 it
 just
 brings
 a
 little


nuance
 to
 the
 conversation.
 Not
 to
 say


men
 and
 women
 are
 not
 different.
 They


absolutely
 are.
 But
 I
 do
 believe
 the
 the


view
 that
 a
 ketogenic
 diet
 is
 uniquely


stressful
 in
 in
 women
 but
 not
 men,
 I


think
 is
 uh
 overblown.
 And
 and
 again,


I'm
 relying
 on
 Isabella's
 own
 data
 to


support
 that.
 So,
 coming
 into
 2026
 and
 I


want
 2026
 to
 be
 the
 year
 where
 I
 finally


get
 a
 grip
 of
 my
 health,
 where
 I
 finally


become
 the
 person
 that
 I
 know
 deep
 down


I
 could
 be
 and
 I
 desperately
 do
 want
 to


be.
 And
 I
 asked
 you,
 Dr.
 Ben,


>> to
 make
 me
 a
 plan,


>> the
 perfect
 plan,
 the
 perfect
 diet.
 I


know
 everyone's
 different,
 so
 we're


gonna
 have
 you
 gonna
 have
 to
 play
 with


me
 here
 a
 little
 bit,
 but


>> the
 perfect
 plan
 for
 2026,


>> what
 would
 you
 prescribe
 as
 a
 diet,


lifestyle
 choices?
 Okay.
 And
 I'm
 going


to
 write
 it
 down.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So
 I
 would
 um
 at
 the
 risk
 of


sounding
 too
 self-absorbed


uh
 I
 this
 is
 I'll
 kind
 of
 describe
 my


own
 approach
 as
 a
 metabolic
 scientist


but
 please
 everyone
 listening
 appreciate


that
 I
 will
 I'm
 inserting
 my
 own


constraints
 because
 my
 approach
 is
 kind


of
 that
 of
 a
 guy
 who
 knows
 a
 lot
 but
 is


also
 constrained
 by
 my
 demands
 in
 life


but
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 fit
 into


that
 category.
 So
 Stephen
 if
 you
 want
 to


look
 like
 a
 freckled
 bald
 wrinkled
 man


this
 is
 what
 you
 can
 do.
 All
 right.
 So,


first
 of
 all,
 zero
 to
 little
 to
 no
 carbs


for
 um
 breakfast
 and
 lunch.


>> Okay.
 Little
 to
 no
 carbs
 for
 breakfast


and
 lunch.
 Carbs
 for
 breakfast
 and


lunch.


>> Yep.
 You
 wake
 up
 in
 the
 morning.
 Anyone


who's
 wearing
 a
 continuous
 glucose


monitor
 will
 find
 that
 their
 glucose


levels
 naturally
 rise
 in
 the
 morning
 and


that
 coincides
 with
 a
 mild
 state
 of


insulin
 resistance
 every
 morning
 because


of
 changes
 in
 cortisol
 and
 other


hormones.
 So
 my
 view
 is
 don't
 doubly


load
 to
 the
 glucose
 that's
 already


happening
 by
 eating
 in
 the
 morning
 with


starchy
 sugary
 stuff.
 So
 be
 very
 strict


with
 all
 of
 your
 meals
 up
 until
 dinner.


>> So
 just
 on
 point
 one
 so
 I'm
 clear.


You're
 saying
 no
 carbs
 but
 is
 there


anything
 that
 I
 should
 be
 having?


>> Yeah.
 So
 any
 if
 a
 person
 wants
 to
 as


much
 protein
 and
 fat
 as
 they'd
 like
 and


I
 would
 say
 especially
 for
 lunch,
 let


lunch
 be
 your
 biggest
 meal.


>> Okay.
 So
 let's
 go
 through
 those
 three


points.
 Yeah.


>> Um
 why
 as
 much
 protein
 as
 I
 can.
 Yeah.


Protein
 and
 fat.


>> Okay.
 Why?


>> Yeah.
 Because
 they
 won't
 have
 an
 insulin


effect.
 And
 that's
 the
 key.
 Like
 my


approach
 to
 staying
 lean
 at
 50
 years
 old


and
 having
 my
 wife
 like
 what
 she
 sees
 is


keeping
 my
 insulin
 low
 and
 and
 still
 not


being
 hungry
 all
 the
 time.
 And
 so


protein
 and
 fat
 are
 the
 two


macronutrients
 with
 carbohydrates
 being


the
 third.
 But
 protein
 and
 fat
 have


little
 to
 no
 effect
 on
 insulin.
 Fat
 has


none
 and
 protein
 may
 have
 a
 modest


effect
 depending
 on
 some
 other


variables.
 So
 you
 want
 to
 keep
 insulin


low.


>> So
 what
 would
 would
 that
 breakfast
 look


like?


>> So
 for
 me,
 I
 actually
 don't
 eat


breakfast.
 Uh
 and
 and
 again,
 this
 plays


into
 I'm
 extremely
 mindful
 of
 my
 family.


So
 that's
 going
 to
 come
 back
 again
 when


we
 get
 to
 dinner
 because
 we've
 left
 that


meal
 untouched
 for
 now.


>> In
 the
 morning,
 I
 make
 breakfast
 for
 my


kids
 every
 morning.
 Uh
 and
 it's


something
 I
 remember
 from
 my
 childhood


being
 raised
 by
 my
 dad
 and
 he
 every


morning
 it
 was
 just
 structured.
 And
 I


think
 all
 of
 my
 siblings
 and
 I
 have


thrived
 in
 life
 in
 part
 because
 of
 the


structure
 we
 had
 at
 the
 beginning
 of


every
 day
 where
 we
 would
 all
 eat


breakfast
 together.
 We
 would
 read


scriptures
 very
 briefly.
 We'd
 have
 a


family
 prayer
 very
 briefly
 and
 just


review
 the
 day.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 was
 my


dad's
 way
 of
 kind
 of
 surviving
 with
 so


many
 kids
 just
 to
 sort
 of
 check
 in
 with


everyone.


>> You
 had
 nine
 siblings.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 There's
 nine
 of
 us.
 Yeah.
 Uh


and
 so
 we
 have
 uh
 I
 I'm
 very
 big
 on


that.
 So
 breakfast
 is
 dad's
 domain
 and


my
 wife
 cheers
 me
 on.
 Um,
 so
 I
 make


breakfast
 for
 the
 kids
 and
 I
 am
 sipping


on
 a
 cup
 of
 yerba
 mate
 the
 whole
 time.


>> Why?


>> Yeah,
 in
 part
 because
 I
 like
 the
 taste.


There's
 a
 good
 GLP1
 effect.
 So,
 it
 helps


me
 feel
 a
 little
 more
 satiated.
 Um,
 and


it's
 just
 a
 habit.
 It's
 a
 little
 bit
 of


a
 perk,
 a
 little
 pickme
 up.
 I
 don't


drink
 coffee.
 I
 drink
 yerba
 mate


instead.


>> What
 is
 herb
 mate?


>> The
 brand
 that
 I
 get
 is
 called
 Una
 Mate.


And
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 leaf.
 It's
 a
 South


American
 tea
 basically.
 And
 you
 can
 get


it
 in
 any
 number
 of
 ways.
 This
 is
 just
 a


really
 convenient
 and
 good
 way
 to
 get


it.
 So
 I'm
 sipping
 on
 a
 cup
 of
 it
 would


be
 someone
 drinking
 coffee
 or
 tea.
 I'm


taking
 yerba
 mate
 tea.
 Um
 so
 I
 don't
 eat


for
 breakfast.
 I
 find
 that
 I'm
 not


generally
 hungry
 for
 breakfast
 anyway.


And
 so
 I
 may
 as
 well
 keep
 my
 fasted


state
 going
 a
 little
 longer.
 So
 that's


what
 works
 for
 me.
 And
 then
 I
 would


encourage
 people
 to
 have
 a
 big
 hearty


lunch
 because
 if
 you
 have
 a
 big
 hearty


lunch,
 mostly
 protein
 and
 fat,
 it
 makes


it
 easier
 to
 taper
 off
 later
 in
 the
 day.


Especially
 in
 the
 evening
 if
 people
 are


noticing
 that
 they
 have
 significant


cravings
 especially
 for
 carbs
 because


that's
 the
 only
 thing
 anyone
 craves
 in


the
 evening
 have
 a
 bigger
 lunch.
 See
 if


that
 helps.


>> Okay.


>> And
 then
 sometime
 around
 either
 before


or
 after
 have
 a
 good
 resistance
 workout.


I
 have
 my
 resistance
 workout
 in
 the
 in


fact
 Stephen
 I
 even
 have
 to
 go
 a
 little


earlier.
 So,
 my
 first
 thing
 in
 the


morning
 is
 I
 go
 on
 a
 ruck
 at
 5:00
 a.m.
 I


have
 my
 weighted
 vest
 and
 these
 15lb


kettle
 bells
 and
 I
 hike
 one
 mile
 up
 a


hill
 and
 one
 mile
 back
 every
 morning
 at


5:00
 a.m.
 And
 then
 I
 get
 a
 little
 work


done
 and
 just
 some
 personal
 kind
 of


reflection
 and
 meditation
 time,
 if
 you


will.
 Then
 the
 family
 wakes
 up.
 I'm


making
 breakfast.
 The
 family
 chaos


begins.
 I'm
 sipping
 on
 my
 yerba
 mate.


Then
 I
 go
 to
 work.
 About
 10:30
 or
 11
 is


the
 good
 time
 for
 me.
 I
 go
 down
 to
 the


gym
 on
 campus
 and
 I
 do
 my
 very
 brief,


very
 effective,
 I
 would
 say,
 um,


resistance
 training
 and
 then
 I
 go
 into


the
 sauna
 for
 12
 to
 15
 minutes,
 but
 in


the
 morning
 I've
 done
 a
 little
 ice
 bath,


too.
 I
 didn't
 mention
 that.
 I
 have
 an


ice
 bath
 on
 my
 back
 patio,
 a
 Maroska


Forge,
 and
 I
 love
 it.
 It
 is
 spectacular.


Um,
 so
 then
 I
 do
 a
 sauna
 session
 after


my
 workout.
 Then
 I
 go
 eat
 my
 big
 lunch.


>> Why
 are
 you
 doing
 the
 ice
 bath
 in
 this


one?
 Yeah.
 So,
 I
 do
 I
 do
 an
 ice
 bath
 in


the
 morning
 because
 it
 helps
 me
 sleep


better
 in
 the
 evening.
 I'm
 a
 terrible


sleeper.
 And
 especially
 in
 the
 northern


hemisphere
 in
 the
 winter,
 the
 sun
 isn't


coming
 up
 till
 9:00
 or
 so,
 9:00
 a.m.
 And


by
 shocking
 my
 body,
 I
 get
 this
 jolt.


And
 I
 think
 it
 just
 helps
 get
 my
 clock


ticking.
 And
 so,
 by
 the
 time
 evening


rolls
 around,
 I'm
 tired
 and
 I'm
 ready


for
 bed.


>> Okay,
 I'm
 just
 doing
 my
 ketone
 test
 to


see
 where
 it
 is.
 We're
 probably
 about
 30


minutes
 off
 me
 taking
 that
 ketone
 shot.


We'll
 continue
 with
 your
 day
 in
 just
 two


sec.
 And
 I'm
 now
 at
 0.9.


>> It'll
 keep
 going.
 Yep.
 Yep.
 So,
 you
 were


08
 0.9.
 Next
 one
 will
 be
 one,
 but
 it


looks
 like
 it's
 starting
 to
 curve
 a


little
 bit,


>> which
 isn't
 surprising.
 You
 went
 up


pretty
 quick
 and
 then
 it's
 going
 to


curve
 for
 a
 bit.


>> And
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 my
 body
 right
 now


that
 I
 have
 0.9


>> K?
 Yes.
 So,
 that
 is
 a
 unit
 of


measurement
 called
 the
 mill
 moles.
 And


so,
 it's
 looking
 at
 the
 number
 of


molecules
 basically
 in
 a
 given
 amount
 of


of
 your
 blood.
 And
 so
 you
 took
 in
 that


ketone
 precursor,
 the
 liver
 converted


it.
 It's
 just
 continuing
 to
 convert
 it


into
 BHB.


>> BHB
 being
 ketones.


>> BHB
 being
 the
 main
 ketone.
 Yep.


>> Okay.
 Yep.


>> And
 that's
 making
 me


>> Well,
 it's
 going
 to
 make
 you
 sharp.


Okay.


>> So,
 your
 brain
 is
 now
 using
 those


ketones.
 Your
 heart
 would
 be
 using
 the


ketones.
 Um,
 and
 your
 reliance
 on


glucose
 as
 a
 fuel
 for
 your
 brain
 and


your
 heart
 would
 be
 going
 down.


>> Wouldn't
 my
 hunger
 be
 going
 down?


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 I'm
 going to
 be
 less
 hungry.
 But


also
 the
 benefits
 of
 BHB
 in
 the
 brain


are
 are
 myriad
 where
 it's
 been
 shown
 to


be
 an
 anxolytic.
 So
 it
 can
 control


anxiety.
 Uh
 it
 can
 control
 it
 can


improve
 depression.
 It
 can
 help
 with


attention,


>> memory.
 I


>> memory.
 Oh,
 certainly
 with
 cognition.


Yes.


>> I've
 read
 I
 read
 about
 the
 studies
 on


dementia
 patients
 that


>> Yes.
 That
 is
 it
 is
 incredibly
 we're


entering
 a
 kind
 of
 dawning
 of
 an
 era
 of


ketone
 research
 where
 the
 number
 of
 NIH


and
 NSF
 funded
 ketone
 related
 projects


is


wonderful.
 It's
 thrilling
 to
 see
 where


it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 wonderful
 decade
 of
 a


lot
 of
 great
 biomedical
 research
 on
 the


metabolism
 of
 ketones.
 Do
 you
 know


something
 I've
 noticed?
 Most
 commercial


teams
 aren't
 tested
 by
 their
 targets.


They're
 tested
 by
 the
 weight
 of
 the


admin
 that
 comes
 with
 every
 client.
 All


the
 follow-ups,
 all
 the
 meetings,
 all


the
 notes,
 the
 timelines
 that
 never
 ever


stop.
 These
 were
 a
 constant
 source
 of


friction
 in
 my
 commercial
 team
 until
 I


introduced
 our
 sponsor,
 Piperive.
 If


you're
 not
 familiar,
 Pipe
 Drive
 is
 a


simple
 but
 powerful
 sales
 CRM
 that
 gives


you
 visibility
 on
 any
 deals
 through
 a


sales
 pipeline.
 It
 also
 automates
 a
 lot


of
 the
 tedious,
 repetitive,
 and


timeconsuming
 tasks
 that
 come
 with
 the


sales
 process.
 I've
 used
 it
 across
 my


investments
 for
 almost
 a
 decade
 now,


even
 when
 I
 was
 at
 Social
 Chain.
 And


it's
 so
 effective
 in
 part
 because
 it's


customizable.
 We've
 been
 able
 to
 tailor


it
 for
 different
 teams
 depending
 on
 how


they
 work.
 Pipe
 Drive
 also
 scales
 with


your
 business,
 and
 you
 can
 also
 link
 it


to
 over
 500
 different
 apps.
 It
 is
 hands


down
 my
 favorite
 CRM
 tool.
 Try
 it
 right


now
 for
 free
 for
 30

 No
 credit

or

 my

below.
 Or
 you
 can
 go
 to
 piperive.com/ce


to
 get

 That's


pipedive.com/ceeo.


>> So
 let's
 go
 back
 to
 the
 perfect
 day,
 the


perfect,
 the
 perfect
 lifestyle
 for
 2026.


So
 then
 do
 my
 resistance
 training
 at


some
 point
 after
 I've
 had
 my
 breakfasts.


>> Well,
 yes.
 So
 whatever
 for
 me,
 I
 I
 do


body
 weight
 based
 exercises.
 So,
 I
 don't


like
 having
 a
 big
 belly
 of
 food.
 And
 so,


being
 in
 a
 fasted
 state,
 my
 view
 on


exercising,
 even
 that's
 a
 debate.
 Do
 you


exercise
 fasted
 or
 do
 you
 exercise
 with


fuel?
 Um,
 like
 you
 take
 a
 bunch
 of
 carbs


and
 stuff.
 My
 view
 is
 it's
 dependent
 on


what
 your
 goal
 is.
 As
 a
 middle-aged
 guy,


my
 goal
 is
 not
 performance.
 It's
 not


going
 out
 and
 sprinting
 and
 showing


power.
 It's
 to
 live
 a
 long
 healthy
 life.


And
 so,
 it's
 a
 more
 metabolic
 focus.
 If


your
 if
 your
 interest
 is
 metabolic,
 then


I
 think
 fasting
 fa
 exercising
 in
 a


fasted
 state
 is
 very
 smart.
 If
 your
 goal


of
 the
 exercise
 is
 performance,
 like


you're
 a
 collegiate
 athlete
 or
 you
 are,


you
 know,
 you're
 an
 elite
 rugby
 player


or
 something,
 okay,
 then
 don't
 exercise


fasted.
 Take
 some
 fuel
 before
 you
 go


work
 out.
 So
 for
 me,
 I've
 done
 my
 early


morning
 ruck,
 my
 personal
 kind
 of


reflection
 time,
 ice
 bath,
 yerba
 mate,


and
 then
 my
 midm
 morning
 workout.


>> Just
 on
 that
 point
 of
 exercising
 fasted,


>> why
 is
 that
 better
 if
 your
 goals
 are


longevity
 and
 health,


>> right?
 Because
 it's
 just
 going
 to
 help


you
 continue
 to
 burn
 fat
 and
 improve


maintain
 your
 insulin
 sensitivity.


>> Okay,
 fine.
 So,
 I
 have
 my
 midm
 morning


workout,
 then
 I
 have
 a
 nice
 big
 lunch,


then
 I
 have
 my
 afternoon
 productivity,


and
 then
 I
 get
 to
 dinner,
 and
 dinner
 is


the
 main
 social
 meal
 within
 my
 home.
 Um,


and
 so
 I
 have
 dinner
 with
 my
 family.
 And


that
 is
 carb
 lunch.
 Whatever
 the


family's
 eating,
 I'm
 eating.
 I
 have
 I


have
 daughters
 and
 as
 a
 college


professor
 I've
 seen
 enough
 young
 women


struggle
 with
 eating
 disorders
 that
 I


always
 worried
 would
 my
 incessant


talking
 about
 diet
 somehow
 stimulate


eating
 disorders
 and
 I've
 never
 wanted


to
 become
 obsessive
 about
 it
 and
 so
 I


have
 dinner
 with
 my
 family
 whatever
 it


is
 if
 it's
 pizza
 I'm
 having
 pizza
 if


it's
 pasta
 I'm
 having
 pasta
 um
 now
 my


wife
 happens
 to
 see
 things
 kind
 of
 the


way
 I
 do
 so
 it's
 usually
 meat
 and


vegetables
 in
 in
 some
 mix
 and
 and
 that's


my
 dinner
 and
 then
 ideally


I'm
 done.


>> What
 time
 are
 you
 having
 that
 dinner?


>> Yeah,
 that's
 about
 five
 or
 six.


>> And
 you
 you
 avoid
 eating
 late.


>> Oh
 yes.
 In
 fact,
 I
 would
 submit
 Stephen,


if
 we
 were
 to
 look
 at
 any
 one
 thing


someone
 could
 do,
 I
 would
 say
 anyone
 who


says,
 "Ben,
 what
 is
 the
 one
 thing?"
 If


I'm
 putting
 a
 question
 in
 your
 mouth,


I'd
 say
 stop
 snacking
 in
 the
 evening.


Anything
 you
 can
 do
 to
 not
 overeat
 and


go
 to
 bed
 hypoglycemic
 or
 elevated
 or


spike
 your
 blood
 glucose
 levels,
 do
 it.


>> Why?


>> That's
 when
 people
 at
 their
 weakest.


People,
 you
 and
 I
 could
 be
 hanging
 out


all
 day
 walking
 past
 a
 plate
 of
 cookies


and
 not
 be
 tempted
 at
 all
 until
 7
 or


8:00
 p.m.
 It's
 just
 human
 nature.
 And


yet
 that
 is
 one
 of
 the
 worst
 times
 to


eat
 it
 because
 when
 you
 go
 to
 bed


hypoglycemic,
 it
 activates
 a
 part
 of
 the


nervous
 system,
 an
 aspect
 of
 the
 nervous


system
 called
 the
 sympathetic
 nervous


system.
 That's
 also
 known
 as
 the
 fight


orflight.
 So
 when
 someone
 we
 hear
 a
 car


crash
 right
 nearby
 or
 we
 hear
 a
 gunshot,


then
 our
 immediately
 our
 heart
 starts


beating
 faster
 and
 harder.
 Our
 body


temperature
 climbs
 and
 we're
 stimulated.


hypoglycemia
 will
 have
 that
 effect.
 And


that
 is
 terrible
 timing
 because
 when


you're
 going
 to
 bed,
 you're
 wanting
 to


rely
 on
 your
 what's
 called
 your


parasympathetic
 nervous
 system.
 The
 part


of
 your
 the
 aspect
 of
 your
 nervous


system
 that
 is
 calming,
 it's
 lowering


your
 heart
 rate.
 It's
 slowing
 your


heart.
 It's
 lowering
 your
 blood


pressure.
 It's
 helping
 you
 calm
 down
 to


sleep
 better.
 Hypoglycemia


throws
 that
 into
 opposites.
 So
 then


you're
 going
 to
 bed,
 you're
 lying
 there


wondering
 why
 your
 heart
 is
 beating
 so


hard,
 why
 you
 are
 so
 hot
 and


uncomfortable,
 and
 it's
 because
 you
 just


spiked
 your
 blood
 glucose
 with
 a
 bunch


of
 sugar.


>> Is
 there
 anything
 else?


Is
 there,
 you
 know,
 for
 people
 that
 are


focused
 on
 that
 2026
 goal
 of
 finally


becoming
 the
 person
 that
 they
 know
 they


can
 become,
 is
 there
 anything
 else
 you


would
 say
 to
 them?
 Is
 there
 any
 tools


they
 need
 to
 buy?
 Is
 there
 any
 other


tricks
 or
 tactics
 or
 hacks?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 do
 think
 that
 they
 could


if
 they
 were
 adopting
 this
 diet,
 it's


definitely
 going
 to
 put
 them
 into


ketosis.
 That
 can
 take
 a
 little
 time
 to


adjust.
 So,
 very
 relevant
 to
 our
 earlier


conversation.
 I
 do
 think
 exogenous


ketones
 can
 help
 a
 person
 transition


into
 relying
 on
 a
 ketogenic
 diet
 more


readily.
 And
 anytime
 a
 person's
 losing


weight,
 they
 run
 the
 risk
 of
 losing
 some


lean
 mass
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 And
 we,
 my


lab
 just
 published
 a
 paper
 about
 two


weeks
 ago
 at
 the
 time
 we're
 filming


this,
 finding
 that
 in
 humans
 in
 a
 weight


loss
 protocol,
 if
 they
 were
 drinking
 BHB


or
 exogenous
 ketones,
 they
 were
 able
 to


retain
 more
 muscle
 mass,
 more
 lean
 mass


in
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 weight
 loss.
 So,


there
 could
 be
 some
 strategies
 like


that.
 But
 I
 would
 also
 add
 that
 there


are
 some
 non
 um
 physical
 ones
 as
 well.


If
 someone's
 trying
 to
 say,
 I'm
 going
 to


be
 the
 best
 version
 of
 myself,
 then


start
 reading
 more,
 too.
 Read
 more


books.
 You'll
 be
 the
 best.
 You'll
 be
 an


even
 better
 version
 as
 you're
 losing


weight.
 Um,
 and
 your
 brain
 is
 firing
 on


more
 cylinders
 than
 ever
 before
 as
 it's


fueled
 with
 ketones.
 Challenge
 your


brain.
 You
 had
 mentioned
 dementia


earlier.
 Ketones
 are
 a
 therapy
 for


dementia,
 but
 so
 too
 is
 challenging
 your


brain
 in
 the
 form
 of
 um
 making
 it
 learn


new
 things.
 So,
 read
 a
 good
 book.


>> This
 woman
 contacted
 me
 on
 the
 on


November
 the
 11th.
 When
 you
 do
 a


podcast,
 you
 get
 lots
 of
 feedback.
 you


get
 like
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 people


sometimes
 per
 episode


>> and
 I
 can
 imagine
 you
 looking
 through


everyone
 finding
 gems.


>> I
 actually
 funnily
 enough
 I
 do
 look
 at


the
 comment
 section
 because
 it's
 it's
 a


place
 where
 I
 really
 trust
 the
 feedback.


So
 people
 that
 comment
 on
 these
 videos


like
 I
 really
 do
 trust
 them
 because
 they


are
 typically
 listeners.
 They've
 kind
 of


been
 with
 me
 on
 this
 whole
 journey.
 So


when
 they
 have
 feedback
 when
 they
 have


you
 know
 good
 or
 bad
 feedback
 on
 the
 or


constructive
 feedback
 we
 pay
 attention.


>> Well
 Stephen
 I'm
 pleased
 that
 something


brought
 me
 back.
 So
 the
 comments
 can't


have
 been
 too
 negative.
 No,
 they
 were


really
 I
 mean
 they
 were
 unbelievably


positive.
 But
 I
 got
 this
 one
 from
 on


LinkedIn
 from
 a
 lady
 called
 I'll
 keep


her
 anonymous.
 Let's
 just
 call
 her
 Mrs.


L.


>> Okay.


>> And
 Mrs.
 L
 said,
 "Hi,
 Stephen.
 Thank
 you


for
 the
 great
 work
 you
 do
 and
 the


information,
 insights,
 inspiration
 you


provide.
 On
 keto,
 my
 husband
 lasted
 8


hours
 on
 a
 keto
 diet
 and
 was


unconscious.
 It
 turned
 out
 he
 had
 a


neurodine
 cancer
 called
 insulum."


>> Oh.
 Oh,
 yeah.
 Yeah.
 No.
 a
 neuroendocrine


cancer
 called
 insulinoma.


>> I
 said
 that's
 exactly
 what
 I
 said.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Did
 I
 hear
 a
 niner
 in
 there?


Yeah.
 Something.


>> And
 if
 the
 paramedics
 hadn't
 intercepted


with
 glucose,
 going
 keto
 would
 have


killed
 him.


>> Yes.


>> He's
 amazing.
 We
 have
 three
 children
 and


he
 volunteers
 for
 50


>> more
 every
 weekend.
 We
 don't
 want
 to


lose
 him.


>> Sorry
 to
 share
 this
 sad
 story,
 but
 it's


not
 the
 first
 time
 I've
 seen
 one
 of
 your


posts
 or
 one
 of
 your
 guests
 talk
 about


ketosis


and
 what's
 worked
 well.
 And
 in
 this


case,
 it
 was
 fatal
 for
 him.
 Yes.
 So,
 I


hope
 you
 don't
 mind,
 but
 I
 wanted
 to


share
 this
 with
 love,
 respect,
 and


kindness
 to
 hopefully
 give
 food
 for


thought,
 no
 pun
 intended,
 of
 how
 you


decide
 to
 use
 your
 platform
 and
 to


provide
 further
 context
 and
 nuance.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> What
 works
 for
 you
 and
 thousands
 of


others
 might
 not
 work
 for
 everyone.
 I


believe
 it's
 super
 important
 that
 we


share
 this
 information
 and
 inspiration


carefully
 and
 in
 a
 way
 that
 exemplifies


a
 growth
 mindset,
 not
 a
 fixed
 mindset.


for
 example,
 not
 fixed
 one
 diet
 or
 one


way
 of
 working
 for
 everybody.
 If
 you


read
 this
 above
 all
 else,
 please
 know


I'm
 sending
 this
 with
 the
 utmost
 respect


and
 kindness
 and
 hope.
 Best


>> love
 it.
 Yeah,
 what
 a
 thoughtful
 what
 a


thoughtful
 message.


>> Yeah,
 it
 is
 very
 thoughtful.
 I


appreciate
 I
 appreciate
 any
 kind


communication
 by
 the
 way
 because
 on


social
 media
 it
 is
 so
 easy
 just
 to


become
 the
 worst
 version
 of
 yourself


without
 fear
 of
 any
 consequence.
 So,
 she


happened
 to
 describe
 a
 person
 who
 would


probably
 be
 the
 the
 worst
 individual.
 So


an
 insulinoma,
 she
 describes
 a


neuroendocrine
 cancer.
 An
 insulinoma
 is


an
 insulin
 secretreting
 tumor.
 So


usually
 it's
 the
 pancreas,
 which
 for


those
 watching
 is
 here.
 Again,
 imagine


that
 a
 part
 of
 the
 pancreas
 is
 expanding


with
 a
 tumor,
 but
 it's
 filled
 with
 cells


that
 make
 insulin.
 So
 it's
 a
 bunch
 of


beta
 cells,
 which
 are
 the
 cells
 that


make
 insulin.
 And
 this
 is
 a
 guy
 who


can't
 stop
 making
 insulin.


Suffice
 to
 say,
 if
 you
 now
 cut
 your


carbohydrate
 consumption
 and
 you're


continuing
 to
 make
 tons
 of
 insulin,


which
 is
 not
 normal,
 so
 this
 is
 a
 very


much
 a
 disease
 state,
 and
 I
 appreciate


her
 stating
 it
 as
 such.
 It's
 a
 cancer,


it's
 a
 tumor
 of
 the
 pancreas.
 So,
 what


would
 have
 happened
 in
 him,
 he
 cuts
 the


gluc,
 he
 cuts
 his
 carbohydrates,
 but
 he


can't
 stop
 making
 insulin.
 So
 now
 it's


actually
 back
 to
 that
 diet
 that
 you
 and


I
 that
 I
 mentioned
 at
 the
 beginning
 of


our
 conversation
 where
 the
 people
 were


eating
 a
 high
 carb
 version
 or
 a
 low
 carb


version
 of
 a
 diet.
 When
 you
 spike


insulin,
 you
 lower
 both
 glucose
 and


ketones.
 And
 that's
 what
 happened
 to


him.
 He
 would
 have
 become
 hypoglycemic


and
 he
 would
 almost
 never
 make
 any


ketones
 because
 he
 always
 has
 high


insulin.
 M


>> and
 so
 he
 would
 have
 been
 depriving
 his


brain
 of
 its
 two
 fuels
 in
 uh
 lowering


the
 glucose
 by
 pushing
 it
 into
 muscle


and
 fat
 and
 blocking
 the
 liver
 from


making
 ketones.
 So
 he's
 the
 worst
 person


anyone
 with
 an
 insulinoma.
 Of
 course


neither
 you
 nor
 I
 are
 giving
 any
 medical


advice.
 Um
 but
 if
 a
 person
 has
 an


insulinoma
 that's
 like
 the
 worst
 person


to
 adopt
 a
 low
 carb
 diet.
 They
 have
 to


eat
 carbs
 because
 they're
 always
 making


insulin.
 They
 can't
 stop.
 What's


interesting
 is
 it
 it
 appears
 from
 what


she's
 written
 that
 her
 husband
 found
 out


that
 he
 had
 this


>> Oh,
 because
 of
 adopting
 the
 diet.


>> Yeah.


>> Oh
 my
 gosh,
 that's
 remarkable.
 Yeah.
 So,


a
 person
 could
 test
 this
 early
 though,


Stephen.
 So,
 just
 what
 you've
 been
 doing


now
 over
 the
 past
 period
 of
 time
 by


pricking
 your
 finger,
 if
 a
 person


worried
 that
 they
 had
 an
 insulinoma,


they
 could
 just
 on
 a
 random
 morning
 uh


or
 fast
 for
 fast
 for
 12
 hours
 or
 so
 and


measure
 your
 glucose.
 Um,
 if
 you
 have
 a


continuous
 glucose
 monitor,
 even
 easier.


Look
 at
 your
 glucose.
 Because
 in
 you
 and


I,
 if
 we
 fast
 for
 24
 hours,
 our
 glucose


levels
 stay
 normal.
 They
 just
 run
 along


like
 nothing's
 happened.
 In
 a
 person


with
 an
 insulinoma,
 they're
 getting


lower
 and
 lower
 and
 lower
 and
 lower
 all


constantly
 because
 they
 can't
 stop


making
 insulin
 and
 it's
 always
 driving


their
 blood
 glucose
 levels
 lower.
 So,
 a


person
 could
 determine
 that
 on
 their


own.
 This
 would
 have
 been
 a
 guy
 who


anytime
 he
 fasted
 at
 all,
 he
 would
 have


started
 to
 feel
 miserable


>> cuz
 she
 says
 in
 the
 message,
 "My
 husband


lasted
 eight
 hours
 on
 a
 keto
 diet
 and


was
 unconscious.
 It
 turned
 out,"
 which


suggests
 that
 they
 found
 out


>> and
 we
 hope
 the
 husband's
 doing
 well.


>> Yes.


>> Boy,
 an
 insulin
 is
 a
 big
 deal.
 My
 hope


is
 that
 they
 would
 be
 able
 to
 identify


the
 location
 of
 the
 tumor.
 Um,
 and
 you


can
 What's
 cool
 about
 cancer
 is
 that


cancer
 is
 such
 a
 sugar
 eater.
 It
 eats
 so


much
 glucose
 that
 you
 can
 inject
 glucose


into
 someone
 that
 has
 a
 little
 bit
 of


radiation
 to
 it,
 not
 harmful,
 but
 then


you
 can
 do
 an
 X-ray
 and
 see
 where
 does


all
 the
 glucose
 go
 and
 it
 would
 be
 going


to
 this
 little
 lump
 on
 the
 on
 the
 on
 the


pancreas.
 And
 so
 hopefully
 they
 can
 cut


it
 out.


>> What
 does
 that
 say
 about
 cancer
 and


sugar?


>> Oh
 my.
 Yeah.
 So
 you
 I
 know
 you've
 had


the
 authority
 on
 this.
 So
 everything
 I'm


about
 to
 say
 is
 me
 quoting
 Dr.
 Thomas


Seaff
 Freed
 who
 is
 he
 needs
 all
 the


attention
 in
 the
 world
 as
 he
 has


resurrected


uh
 an
 almost
 100-year-old
 view
 of
 cancer


being
 a
 disease
 of
 glucose
 and
 sugar


metabolism
 the
 Warberg
 effect
 it's


called
 but
 Dr.
 Thomas
 Seaff
 Freed
 has


been
 a
 champion
 of
 of
 bringing
 this
 view


into
 the
 modern
 era
 by
 finding
 that


cancer
 cells
 rely
 on
 glucose
 as
 their


fuel
 primarily.
 He
 also
 identifies


glutamine.
 But
 if
 you
 can
 deprive
 the


cancer
 cell
 of
 its
 fuel,
 normal


interventions
 even
 like
 chemotherapies


which
 have
 terrible
 rates
 of
 success,


they
 become
 suddenly
 much
 more


effective.


>> In
 fact,
 my
 part
 of
 my
 motivation
 in


adhering
 to
 a
 ketogenic
 diet
 is
 is


cancer
 related.
 when
 I
 my
 mom
 passed


away
 from
 cancer
 as
 a
 boy
 and
 it's
 been


one
 of
 those
 diseases
 that's
 always


scared
 me
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 I
 think
 all


right
 my
 statistical
 likelihood
 of


getting
 a
 cancer
 in
 life
 is
 going
 to
 be


higher
 than
 average
 because
 of
 a


first-degree
 relative
 dying
 from
 cancer


so
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 and
 I've
 already


outlived
 my
 my
 my
 saintly
 mom
 now
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 I
 adhere
 to
 a
 ketogenic
 diet


is
 I
 want
 to
 do
 what
 I
 can
 to
 try
 to


kill
 any
 little
 budding
 cancer
 cells
 by


starving
 them
 of
 their
 glucose
 that
 they


want


>> remember
 when
 we
 had
 him
 on
 the
 show


remember
 the
 BBC
 obviously
 weren't
 very


happy
 that
 I
 had
 him
 on
 and
 said
 that
 it


was
 uh


>> no


>> it
 was
 misinformation.


>> Oh
 my
 gosh,
 isn't
 that
 unfortunate?
 So


he
 is
 the
 leading
 authority
 I
 would
 say


in
 the
 world
 on
 cancer
 metabolism
 and


it's
 such
 a
 shame
 that
 his
 finding
 and


let let
 me
 he
 might
 have
 explained
 this


already
 but
 I
 just
 want
 to
 explain
 to


everyone
 as
 a
 scientist
 how
 thrilled
 I


was
 to
 see
 what
 he'd
 done
 and
 how


disruptive
 it
 was
 to
 the
 convention.
 And


let's
 ad
 let's
 admit
 what
 we
 think
 we


know
 about
 cancer
 isn't
 working.
 Cancer


rates
 continue
 to
 climb.
 Cancer


mortality
 continues
 to
 climb.
 Clearly


the
 old
 views
 aren't
 working.
 He
 took


tumor
 cells
 and
 then
 so
 cancer
 cells
 and


then
 moved
 over
 the
 nucleus
 because
 the


traditional
 view
 is
 that
 it's
 a
 disease


of
 mutations
 and
 all
 of
 these
 genes
 are


in
 the
 nucleus
 the
 the
 kind
 of
 brain
 of


the
 cell.
 He
 took
 the
 nucleus
 from
 a


cancer
 cell,
 put
 it
 into
 a
 healthy
 cell,


and
 then
 you
 would
 think
 if
 it's
 a


disease
 of
 the
 nucleus
 and
 all
 of
 those


genes,
 mutations,
 this
 cell
 should
 have


cancer
 now.
 And
 yet,
 it
 didn't.
 It
 was
 a


totally
 normal
 cell.
 It
 didn't
 matter
 at


all
 that
 it
 now
 had
 the
 nucleus
 of
 a


cancer
 cell.
 However,
 when
 he
 took
 the


mitochondria


from
 the
 the
 energy
 factory
 of
 the
 cell


that's
 so
 disrupted
 in
 cancer,
 he
 took


the
 mitochondria
 from
 the
 cancer
 cell,


put
 that
 into
 a
 normal
 cell.
 Now,
 it
 was


a
 cancer
 cell.


But
 what
 a
 disruptive
 view.
 It
 proves


that
 it's
 a
 mitochondrial
 problem
 more


than
 a
 nucleus
 problem.
 And
 then
 it


suggests
 it
 it
 adds
 evidence
 to
 his
 view


and
 th
 others
 of
 us
 as
 well
 that
 cancer


is
 a
 metabolic
 problem.


>> So
 when
 when
 you
 know
 publications
 like


the
 BBC
 attack
 my
 guest
 for
 saying
 such


a
 thing
 or
 for
 you
 know
 for
 me
 having


them
 on
 the
 show
 and
 suggest
 that
 it's


like
 misinformation
 or
 dangerous


information.


>> How
 how
 how
 do
 you
 inter
 how
 do
 you


interpret
 that
 cuz


>> oh
 it's
 so
 discouraging.
 Um
 I
 I


interpret
 it
 as
 we've
 seen
 echoes
 and


shadows
 of
 this
 in
 the
 past
 five
 or
 six


years
 um
 with
 the
 pandemic
 and


everything
 related
 to
 it
 where
 science


can
 be
 very
 inconvenient
 um
 to


various
 entities
 and
 institutions.
 Um


and
 we
 see
 scientists
 who
 will


compromise
 themselves
 to
 try
 to
 receive


the
 funding
 and
 the
 adoration
 of
 those


institutions
 and
 entities.


But
 it
 is
 anti-
 it
 is
 it
 is
 an
 attack.


Science
 is
 a
 the
 pursuit
 of
 truth.
 I
 I
 I


was
 blessed
 to
 do
 my
 dissertation
 work,


my
 PhD
 studies
 with
 a
 wonderful
 man


named
 Lionus
 Dome.
 I
 will
 love
 him


forever.
 Um
 one
 of
 the
 things
 he
 taught


me,
 I'd
 come
 to
 him
 with
 discouraging


results.
 The
 hypothesis
 that
 I'd
 had


with
 regards
 to
 fat
 and
 insulin


resistance,
 it
 was
 not
 supporting.
 The


data
 were
 terrible
 in
 this
 particular


line
 of
 experiments.
 And
 he
 wasn't
 he


was
 unflapable.
 He
 wasn't
 upset.
 He


wasn't
 angry.
 He
 said,
 "Ben,
 don't
 be


upset.
 That's
 truth.
 We
 are
 seekers
 of


truth."
 That's
 what
 scientists
 are.
 What


a
 glorious
 thing
 to
 get
 paid
 to
 seek


truth.
 It
 doesn't
 pay
 that
 well,
 but
 it


it's
 a
 glorious
 job
 nonetheless.


That
 is
 what
 Dr.
 Thomas
 Seaf
 Freed
 is


doing.
 And
 when
 I
 think
 you
 have
 a
 big


entity
 like
 the
 BBC
 telling
 a
 scientist


who's
 simply
 stating
 his
 own
 findings


that
 have
 been
 peer-
 reviewviewed
 by


other
 experts
 in
 the
 field,
 it
 should
 be


beyond
 it
 should
 be
 he
 should
 have
 every


platform
 in
 the
 world
 to
 talk
 about


this.
 Every
 scientist
 ought
 to
 and
 it


ought
 to
 be
 scrutinized.
 Scientists


should
 never
 think
 they
 know
 the
 truth.


Even
 the
 declarations
 in
 the
 past
 few


years
 of
 believe
 the
 science.
 No,
 that


is
 anti-scientific.


Science
 is
 is
 con
 a
 scientist
 must
 be
 so


humble
 that
 he
 or
 she
 is
 constantly


prepared
 to
 dump
 their
 hypothesis
 if


they've
 been
 shown
 to
 be
 wrong.


>> And
 I
 guess
 it's
 important
 for
 those


ideas
 to
 be
 out
 there
 for
 you
 to
 even
 be


able
 to
 scrutinize
 them
 and
 challenge


them,


>> especially
 in
 something
 like
 cancer


where
 clearly
 what
 we're
 doing
 isn't


working.
 And
 so
 let's
 welcome
 new
 ideas.


And
 his
 evidence
 is
 incredibly


compelling.
 It's
 it's
 so
 discouraging
 to


hear,
 but
 but
 it
 is
 also
 Stephen
 perhaps


a
 manifestation
 of
 a
 broader
 opposition


to
 anything
 low
 carb.
 You
 just
 utter
 the


word
 ketone
 to
 a
 dogmatic
 and


conventionally
 trained
 dietician.
 Oh
 my


gosh,
 you
 are
 tempting
 their
 wrath.
 They


will
 it's
 it's
 like
 the
 more
 the
 more


educated
 a
 person
 gets,
 the
 more
 rigid


they
 become
 from
 time
 to
 time
 in
 their


ideas.
 You
 should
 never
 see
 that
 in
 a


scientist.
 A
 scientist
 by
 our
 by
 our


through
 our
 training,
 we
 should
 be


humble
 enough
 to
 admit
 that
 we
 don't


know
 everything.


>> I
 remember
 when
 um
 they
 contacted
 me,


the
 journalist
 at
 the
 BBC,
 and
 said,


"We're
 going to
 write
 the
 story
 about,


you
 know,
 the
 misinformation
 spread
 by


these
 guests."
 And
 I
 looked
 at
 what
 they


had
 said
 and
 this
 and
 they
 made
 this


little
 documentary
 did
 this
 article
 and


they
 had
 found
 that
 0.0


Zero
 zero
 1%
 of
 our
 total
 recorded
 hours


of
 conversation
 and
 transcripts
 contain


things
 that
 they
 thought
 were
 could
 be


disputed.


>> Oh
 my
 god.


>> And
 they
 felt
 with
 0.00


one
 they
 would
 write
 this
 big
 breaking


news
 story
 in
 this
 article.
 And
 I


remember
 thinking
 oh
 like
 that
 was
 the


day
 that
 I
 that
 I
 felt
 I
 understood.


>> That
 was
 the
 day
 that
 I
 felt
 I


understood
 how
 the
 system
 works.


>> You
 could
 you
 peaked
 behind
 the
 curtain.


I
 got
 to
 see
 behind
 the
 curtain
 and
 I


was
 like,
 "Oh,
 I
 thought,


>> you
 know,
 I
 thought
 that
 um
 these
 like


cuz
 it's
 like
 a
 big
 brand
 and
 I've
 grown


up
 looking
 at
 it.
 I
 thought
 like
 they


are
 so
 concerned
 about
 rigor
 and
 the


most
 important
 thing
 and
 balance."
 And
 I


said
 to
 the
 I
 said
 to
 the
 journalist,
 I


said
 um
 of
 what
 you
 found
 0.001


because
 they
 said
 you've
 got
 a
 right
 to


reply.
 So
 that
 was
 my
 reply.


>> They


>> and
 of
 course
 they
 wouldn't
 have


published
 that.


>> They
 took
 it
 out.
 They
 took
 my
 response


out
 because
 it
 was
 too
 d
 it
 was
 too
 like


you
 know.
 Yep.
 And
 then
 obviously
 the


other
 thing
 they
 pointed
 at
 another


guest
 that
 I'd
 had
 on
 and
 said,
 you


know,
 you
 also
 had
 this
 person
 on
 and
 I


so
 I
 went
 on
 I
 just
 typed
 his
 name
 in


and
 the
 word
 BBC
 and
 they'd
 had
 him
 on


too.


>> Oh
 my
 god.


>> And
 in
 fact,
 when
 he
 had
 came
 on
 this


particular
 doctor
 and
 he
 had
 said
 his


points
 of
 views,
 the
 journalist
 at
 the


BBC
 had
 just
 basically
 said
 nothing
 and


that
 was
 the
 end
 of
 the
 segment.
 When
 he


said
 it
 to
 me,


>> then
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 it's
 a
 problem.


>> No,
 I
 read
 out
 the
 rebuttal
 from
 the


British
 Heart
 Foundation.
 I
 read
 out
 all


of
 the
 rebuttals
 to
 what
 he
 just
 said,


but
 of
 course
 the
 BBC
 published
 this


article
 saying
 that
 I'd
 had
 him
 on.
 They


had
 had
 him
 on
 too.
 They'
 never


rebuttled
 him.
 I
 did.
 And
 they
 and
 so


this
 was
 the
 moment
 that
 I
 thought


>> you're
 becoming
 disruptive.
 To
 be


honest,
 I
 suspect
 a
 part
 of
 it
 is
 you


are
 the
 embodiment
 of
 a
 new
 media.
 You


know,
 I
 I
 think
 even
 beyond
 the
 science.


So
 if
 this
 had
 been
 in
 the
 US,
 I
 would


have
 speculated
 that
 a
 part
 of
 the
 their


concern
 would
 have
 been
 that
 you
 are


sharing,
 you're
 platforming
 someone
 who


is
 bad
 for
 their
 bottom
 line
 because
 so


much
 of
 the
 income
 that
 nudes
 that
 media


outlets
 get
 in
 the
 US
 is
 from
 drug


company
 ads.
 In
 the
 UK,
 you
 don't
 have


that.
 Drug
 companies
 don't
 um
 aren't
 I


don't
 think
 they're
 allowed
 to
 air
 ads


on
 normal
 channels.
 In
 the
 UK,
 I
 think


is
 to
 a
 degree
 happening
 everywhere.


your
 platform
 is
 probably
 bigger
 than


many
 of
 theirs
 and
 they
 might
 feel


that's
 threatening.


>> It's
 interesting
 because
 I
 try
 and


remain
 as
 objective
 as
 I
 can.
 So
 in


those
 moments,
 one
 of
 my
 strategies
 is


to
 try
 and
 understand
 what
 the
 signal
 is


versus
 the
 noise


>> and
 to
 take
 all
 of
 this
 noise
 and
 figure


out
 exactly
 um
 what
 really
 really


matters
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 my
 genuine


mission,
 which
 is
 for
 the
 audience
 that


decide
 to
 tune
 in
 every
 single
 week
 and


day
 and
 month
 to
 get
 really
 great


information
 to
 improve
 their
 lives.


Yeah.
 and
 uh
 to
 to
 be
 able
 to
 strive
 at


the
 things
 that
 they
 care
 about
 striving


for,
 whether
 that's
 business
 or


entrepreneurship
 or
 whether
 it's
 their


health
 goals
 or
 fitness
 or
 finance
 or


whatever.
 And
 the
 thing
 I
 actually
 took


away
 from
 it
 is
 that
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of


information
 um
 when
 you're
 pursuing


science.


>> And
 so
 the
 one
 of
 the
 best
 things
 we
 can


do
 because
 we
 know
 we're
 going
 to


continue
 to
 have
 lots
 of
 different


voices
 on
 the
 show
 is
 to
 continue
 to


provide
 more
 context
 on
 what's
 what's


being
 said.
 So,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we've


we
 introduced
 this
 year,
 which
 I
 really


love,
 is
 on
 the
 screen
 during
 these


conversations
 as
 you're
 talking
 about


different
 complicated
 words
 or
 you're


talking
 about
 different
 studies
 or


whatever
 it
 might
 be,
 those
 studies
 will


be
 appearing
 on
 the
 screen
 for
 the


audience
 to
 see.


>> And
 I
 think
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 first
 in


podcasting.
 I
 don't
 think
 anyone
 else


any
 of
 the
 major
 podcasters
 have
 done


done
 this
 kind
 of
 thing.
 But
 that
 is


something
 I
 actually
 took
 away
 from
 it.


I
 thought,
 you
 know what,
 we
 can
 give


our
 audience
 even
 more
 context
 so
 that


they
 have
 a
 fuller
 picture.


>> That's
 brilliant.
 So,
 you
 know,
 every


cloud.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 No,
 it's
 certainly
 an


opportunity
 to
 iterate
 and
 say,
 "All


right,
 how
 could
 we
 do
 it
 better?"
 Not


everyone's
 going
 to
 not
 everyone's
 going


to
 take
 that
 approach,
 though.


>> Always.
 And,
 you
 know,
 like
 it
 always


come
 the
 question
 I
 was
 asking
 myself
 is


like,
 "What
 are
 we
 here
 to
 do
 and
 what


is
 our
 mission?
 And
 what
 would
 further


the
 success
 of
 our
 mission?"
 And
 that's


one
 such
 thing.
 So,
 for
 people,
 I
 had
 a


lady
 contact
 me
 the
 other
 day.
 She
 said,


"I
 listen
 on
 Spotify.
 I
 didn't
 realize


that
 you
 were
 doing
 these
 like
 pop-up


things
 on
 screen."
 But,
 um,


>> but
 they're
 there.
 And
 also,
 I
 mean,


there
 definitely
 is
 a
 reason
 to
 watch.


>> Yeah.
 And
 in
 the
 description
 as
 well,


there'll
 be
 there'll
 be
 a
 link
 to


context
 as
 well
 that
 you
 can
 check
 out.


>> But
 getting
 back
 to
 it,
 um,
 so
 2026,


you've
 given
 me
 the
 sort
 of
 daily


protocol
 to
 follow.
 Is
 there
 anything


else
 that
 we've
 missed
 cuz
 I
 really
 want


to
 make
 sure
 that
 people
 listening


achieve
 their
 2026
 health
 goals.
 I
 And


you
 know
 what
 those
 goals
 are
 because


people
 message
 you.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Oh,
 yeah.
 I
 mean,
 it's


always
 it's
 almost
 always
 weight
 loss
 in


some
 way,
 shape,
 or
 form.
 No,
 I
 think


that
 protocol
 is
 smart.
 I
 mean
 we
 didn't


talk
 I
 mentioned
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the


role
 of
 exogenous
 ketones
 um
 which
 I
 am


an
 advocate
 of
 uh
 and
 I
 would
 say
 if
 a


person
 is
 able
 to
 maybe
 just
 sort
 of


look
 at
 what
 other
 supplements
 they


might
 be
 interested
 in
 like
 omega-3
 if


they
 are
 looking
 to
 gain
 muscle
 and


they're
 working
 out
 and
 doing
 some


resistance
 protocols
 definitely
 I
 would


say
 if
 you're
 not
 eating
 omega-3
 rich


sources
 of
 foods
 like
 fish
 then
 get
 a


good
 omega-3
 supplement.
 Omega-3
 helps


with
 muscle
 building
 in
 a
 very


meaningful
 way.
 It's
 It's
 not
 just
 one


of
 those
 It's
 not
 just
 something
 you


take
 for
 heart
 health.


>> We
 were
 talking
 before
 we
 started


recording
 about
 vitamins.


>> Mhm.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 So,
 I
 was
 joking


with
 you
 about
 how
 I
 was
 listening
 to


this
 conversation.
 So,
 everything
 I'm


about
 to
 explain,
 people
 know
 that
 I
 am


I'm
 not
 an
 expert.
 As
 much
 as
 I'm
 a


metabolism
 expert,
 that
 allows
 me
 to


talk
 about
 this
 somewhat
 intelligently.


So,
 let
 me
 lay
 the
 groundwork
 here.
 So,


I
 was
 listening
 to
 a
 discussion
 of
 a


rancher,
 a
 person
 who's
 growing


livestock.
 And
 of
 course,
 just
 to
 help


the
 business,
 you
 want
 these
 animals
 to


get
 as
 big
 and
 even
 fat
 as
 possible
 and


then
 get
 them
 off
 um
 to
 to
 you
 know,


just
 make
 your
 money.
 They
 found
 that


I'm
 going
 to
 I'm
 going
 to
 mess
 up
 these


numbers
 a
 little
 bit,
 but
 I'm
 going
 to


be
 closer
 than
 than
 someone
 might
 think.


>> I'll
 put
 them
 on
 the
 screen.
 So
 they


found
 that
 for
 roughly
 every
 six
 pounds


of
 feed
 they
 would
 give
 an
 animal.
 So


for
 every
 six
 pounds
 of
 food,
 you
 could


expect
 one
 pound
 of
 growth
 in
 just


normal
 a
 normal
 feed
 of
 normal
 just
 a


mix
 of
 the
 the
 soy,
 the
 corn,
 whatever


they're
 eating
 in
 in
 pigs
 or
 cattle.
 And


then
 if
 you
 start
 adding
 B
 vitamin


complexes,
 like
 a
 bunch
 of
 B
 vitamins,


and
 then
 the
 higher
 that
 gets,
 you
 can


go
 from
 3
 L
 pounds
 of
 feed
 is
 enough
 to


get
 one
 pound.
 All
 up
 to
 the
 point
 where


they
 could
 find
 that
 they
 could
 give
 the


animals
 for
 every
 two
 pounds
 of
 food


they
 would
 eat,
 they
 would
 gain
 one


pound.
 So
 they
 had
 effectively
 tripled


the
 efficiency
 with
 which
 the
 animals


were
 able
 to
 get
 fat
 off
 of
 a
 given


amount
 of
 food.
 So,
 one
 of
 my
 concerns


as
 a
 scientist
 is
 the
 degree
 to
 which


part
 of
 our
 obesity
 epidemic
 might
 be


the
 degree
 to
 which
 we
 are
 consuming
 too


much
 vitamins,
 especially
 B
 vitamins.


And
 the
 irony
 there
 is
 that
 people
 take


B
 vitamins
 because
 they
 want
 their


metabolism
 to
 be
 more
 efficient.
 You'll


hear
 that
 term.
 And
 yet,
 when
 it
 comes


to
 weight
 loss,
 you
 actually
 don't
 want


efficiency.
 You
 want
 inefficiency.
 Let


me
 invoke
 the
 analogy
 of
 an
 engine.
 So,


let's
 imagine
 that
 we're
 sitting
 in
 a


car
 and
 we
 are
 in
 drive.
 We're
 in
 gear.


We
 press
 the
 accelerator
 and
 we
 see
 the


RPMs
 going
 up.
 That
 means
 we're
 burning


fuel.
 The
 engine's
 revving.
 And
 because


we're
 in
 drive,
 we're
 moving.
 So,
 we're


actually
 driving.
 So,
 we're
 getting
 work


done.
 That's
 what
 we
 would
 say
 is


efficient.
 And
 an
 inefficient
 metabolism


is
 actually
 more
 conducive
 to
 weight


loss
 because
 now
 you're
 revving
 your


engine,
 but
 you're
 in
 neutral.
 And
 so,


you're
 not
 going
 anywhere.
 you
 don't


have
 to
 get
 any
 work
 done.
 So,
 this


would
 that's
 maybe
 a
 little
 step
 too
 far


with
 the
 metaphor,
 but
 B
 vitamins
 are


essentially
 making
 potentially
 the


mitochondria
 and
 the
 cell
 be
 so


efficient
 that
 it's
 storing
 more
 energy


better
 rather
 than
 burning
 it
 and


wasting
 it.


>> Storing
 more
 fat.


>> Storing
 more
 fat.
 You
 see
 echoes
 of
 you


see
 hints
 of
 this
 in
 human
 studies
 where


when
 they
 take
 high
 doses
 of
 niacin
 in


various
 clinical
 trials,


>> what's
 nice?
 It's
 one
 of
 the
 B
 vitamins


or
 many
 of
 the
 B
 vitamins,
 but
 do
 you


see
 substance
 in
 humans
 of
 of
 that


supports
 this
 view
 where
 high
 doses
 of


some
 of
 these
 vitamins
 do
 result
 in


weight
 gain?
 Now,
 they're
 not
 really


wellont
 controlled
 studies,
 but


nevertheless,
 combined
 with
 the
 animal


data,
 it
 does
 suggest
 that
 there's


something
 about
 maybe
 people
 taking
 too


many
 of
 these
 B
 vitamins
 and
 they're


getting
 fatter
 for
 every
 calorie


consumed
 because
 the
 body
 is
 just


storing
 it
 too
 easily.


>> And
 you're
 talking
 about
 taking
 too


much.
 You're
 not
 talking
 about


>> taking
 too
 much.
 I'm
 not
 talking
 about


like
 reaching
 the
 daily
 minimum,
 but


people
 are
 going
 like
 two
 or
 three
 or


four
 times
 beyond
 that
 nowadays
 because


everything
 is
 fortified.
 You'd
 mentioned


one
 of
 the
 people
 in
 the
 comments


mentioned
 that
 they
 cut
 out
 flour.
 Flour


is
 heavily
 heavily
 fortified
 with
 B


vitamins.
 And
 so
 every
 time
 we're
 eating


it,
 we're
 getting
 B
 vitamins
 from


everything.
 And
 usually
 it's
 coming
 with


processed
 carbohydrates.
 So
 one
 more


reason
 because
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 get


an
 overload
 of
 B
 vitamins
 from
 just


steak
 and
 eggs.
 It's
 going
 to
 be


something
 that's
 been
 packaged
 because


it's
 been
 fortified
 with
 these
 B


vitamins.
 So,
 one
 of
 that
 might
 be
 one


of the
 reasons
 why
 people
 are
 getting


fatter
 than
 ever.


>> I've
 got
 this
 uh
 pen
 in
 front
 of
 me.
 Do


you
 know what
 this
 is?


>> That's
 a
 GLP-1
 medication.


>> A
 Zmpeek.


>> Ompic.
 Yeah.


>> I've
 got
 an
 Ampec
 pen
 right
 here.
 Now,


you've
 told
 me
 lots
 of
 different
 ways


that
 I
 can
 lose
 my
 body
 fat
 in
 2026,


but
 couldn't
 I
 just
 jab
 myself
 with
 this


and
 my
 hunger
 will
 evaporate
 and
 I'll


lose
 fat.
 So
 that
 works
 until
 it


doesn't.
 By
 that
 I
 mean
 we
 have
 really


really
 good
 data
 now.
 So
 briefly
 on


GLP1,
 although
 I
 know
 your
 audience
 is


probably
 very
 familiar
 with
 this
 by
 now.


GLP-1
 is
 primarily
 a
 satiety
 hormone.


It'll
 tell
 the
 brain
 that
 we're
 done


eating
 and
 it
 will
 slow
 down
 the


intestines
 significantly.
 So
 you'll
 eat


food.
 If
 you
 and
 I
 were
 to
 go
 eat
 lunch,


again,
 I've
 used
 that
 a
 couple
 times.


Our
 food
 would
 be
 in
 our
 stomach
 for


four
 to
 six
 hours
 maybe.
 If
 we
 injected


ourselves
 with
 a
 GLP-1
 drug,
 which
 puts


an
 artificial
 amount
 of
 GLP-1
 in
 our


body,
 boom,
 we
 sh
 it
 in.
 It's
 some
 we


grab
 a
 piece
 of
 fat
 and
 jab
 it
 in.
 Then


it
 would
 it
 slows
 down
 people's


intestines
 so
 much
 that
 they'll
 have


food
 sitting
 in
 there
 for
 24
 hours.
 So,


one
 of
 the
 things
 people
 talk
 about
 is


what's
 called
 ompic
 burps
 where
 they


just
 have
 this
 kind
 of
 belching
 bubbling


gas
 because
 the
 food
 is
 sitting
 in
 the


stomach
 for
 way
 longer
 than
 it's


supposed
 to.
 So,
 no
 surprise
 the
 people


are
 less
 interested
 in
 food.
 GLP-1
 tells


the
 brain
 they
 don't
 need
 to
 eat
 as
 much


and
 slows
 down
 the
 intestines.
 Now,


however,
 I
 said
 it
 works
 until
 it


doesn't.


There
 the
 main
 thing
 it
 helps
 people
 do


is
 eat
 less
 carbohydrates.
 It
 controls


cravings
 particularly.
 But
 there
 was
 a


human
 paper
 that
 found
 when
 they


followed
 people
 for
 2
 years.
 It
 was
 a


beautiful
 figure.
 At
 about
 6
 months,


they
 found
 that
 sweet
 cravings
 dropped


significantly.
 A
 huge
 reduction
 in
 their


cravings
 for
 chocolate
 and
 sweets.
 At
 12


months,
 it
 creeped
 up
 a
 little
 bit,
 but


it
 was
 still
 noticeably
 below
 where
 it


started.
 At
 2
 years,
 it
 was
 right
 back


to
 normal.
 So
 at
 two
 years
 on
 the
 drug,


the
 effects
 of
 having
 them
 not
 be


interested
 in
 that
 plate
 of
 cookies
 now


it's
 gone.


>> What's
 going
 on
 there?


>> So
 yeah,
 it's
 it's
 diminishing
 returns


as
 to
 invoke
 a
 principle
 of
 economics.


Doing
 the
 same
 thing
 again
 and
 again
 and


again
 starts
 to
 work
 less
 and
 less
 and


less.
 This
 we
 see
 this
 manifested
 in


innumerable
 different
 ways
 of


medications.
 So
 why
 do
 our
 clinicians


why
 does
 the
 doctor
 tell
 us
 to
 make
 sure


we
 take
 our
 full
 dose
 of
 antibiotic?


Because
 if
 we
 don't,
 we
 give
 it
 just


enough
 for
 the
 bacteria
 to
 become


resistant
 to
 it.
 And
 now
 next
 time
 we


would
 need
 two
 times
 the
 amount
 of
 B
 of


antibiotic
 we
 had.
 So
 it's
 it's
 natural


for
 the
 human
 body
 to
 become
 less


responsive
 to
 a
 stimulus.
 And
 that
 is
 so


much
 GLP-1
 activation
 that
 it's
 no


surprise
 that
 the
 body
 starts
 to
 say,


"Hey,
 you're
 screaming
 at
 me
 too
 much


and
 I'm
 going
 to
 become
 deaf
 to
 your


signal."


So
 it
 starts
 to
 work
 less.
 And
 in
 the
 UK


and
 in
 the
 US
 about
 70%
 of
 people
 get


off
 the
 drug
 of
 their
 own
 valition
 at


two
 years.
 They
 get
 tired
 of
 being
 on


the
 drug
 because
 it's
 basically
 like
 a


constant
 state
 of
 nausea.
 That's
 that's


kind
 of
 how
 you'd
 say
 it
 works
 that
 if


you're
 feeling
 always
 a
 little
 nauseous,


you
 just
 don't
 really
 want
 to
 snack
 on


something
 and
 people
 get
 tired
 of


feeling
 nauseous.
 But
 another
 two-year


study,
 two
 years
 appears
 to
 be
 kind
 of
 a


magic
 timeline,
 found
 that
 of
 of
 every


every
 pound
 they
 lost,
 40%
 of
 it
 was


from
 lean
 ma
 from
 fat-ree
 mass.


>> What
 does
 that
 mean?


>> So
 that
 means
 60%
 was
 coming
 from
 fat,


40%
 was
 coming
 from
 not
 fat,
 including


muscle
 and
 bone.
 It
 would
 be
 water
 as


well,
 but
 muscle
 and
 bone.
 And
 that


matters
 because
 imagine
 if
 we
 have
 an


older
 woman.
 Let's
 imagine
 a
 60-year-old


woman
 who
 wants
 to
 lose
 weight
 and
 goes


on
 a
 drug.


If
 she's
 lost
 weight
 now
 and
 then
 two


years
 later
 wants
 to
 get
 off
 the
 drug


like
 70%
 of
 people
 do,
 she
 will
 her
 fat


mass
 will
 come
 right
 back,
 but
 her
 lean


mass
 may
 never
 come
 back.
 That
 muscle


and
 bone
 may
 be
 gone
 for
 good.


>> Who
 is
 it
 for?
 Who
 who
 would
 you


recommend
 definitely
 does
 that
 does
 it


uses
 it?
 And
 for
 how
 long
 with
 what


other
 supplementation?
 Yeah,
 my
 my


recommendation
 of
 the
 drug
 is
 to
 not


currently
 it's
 being
 used
 for
 weight


loss
 where
 people
 just
 say
 here,
 jab


yourself
 with
 this
 and
 you're
 going
 to


lose
 weight.
 Um,
 and
 it
 works.
 They
 will


absolutely
 lose
 weight.
 But
 again,
 the


concern
 being
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 uh


lose
 a
 lot
 of
 lean
 mass
 at
 the
 same


time.
 So
 my
 best
 use
 of
 that
 drug
 would


be
 using
 it
 with
 two
 distinct
 purpose,


two
 two
 ways,
 but
 for
 one
 purpose,
 which


is
 this
 is
 a
 drug
 that's
 going
 to
 help


you
 learn
 to
 control
 carbohydrates


because
 that's
 the
 one
 macronutrient


that
 people
 are
 addicted
 to.
 They're


addicted
 to
 carbs.
 We
 eat
 too
 many


carbs.
 We're
 a
 carb
 crazed
 culture.
 So


my
 view
 is
 use
 these
 drugs
 to
 help


people
 cure
 their
 cravings
 for


carbohydrates.


>> But
 then
 when
 I
 stop
 taking
 it,
 isn't
 it


going
 to
 come
 back?


>> Well,
 so
 that's
 it
 then.
 So
 then
 you
 use


it
 in
 two
 different
 ways.
 One,
 you
 use
 a


much
 lower
 dose
 than
 is
 currently
 used.


what
 we
 could
 call
 a
 micro
 dose,
 if
 you


will.
 Um,
 so
 use
 a
 lower
 dose
 and
 you


cycle
 it
 on
 and
 off.
 So
 what
 I
 think


people
 should
 be
 doing,
 and
 I'm
 going
 to


talk
 about
 evidence
 to
 support
 this
 in


just
 a
 second,
 go
 90
 days
 on
 the
 drug
 at


a
 low
 dose
 while
 receiving
 coaching
 or


counseling
 on
 how
 to
 use
 a
 low
 carb
 diet


because
 they
 will
 find
 it
 easier
 than


ever
 to
 control
 their
 carb
 consumption.


Then
 at
 the
 end
 of
 90
 days,
 wean
 them


off
 the
 drug
 and
 say,
 "Let's
 see
 if


these
 habits
 have
 stuck."
 Very
 often


they
 have.
 I
 know
 many,
 many
 people,
 and


again,
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 publishing
 a


report
 on
 this.
 I'll
 touch
 on
 that
 in


just
 a
 second,
 who
 they've
 done
 90-day


cycle
 of
 a
 lowdose
 GLP-1
 coupled
 with


coaching
 on
 how
 to
 do
 a
 low
 carb
 diet,


and
 they
 find
 that
 their
 cravings
 are


gone
 and
 they
 don't
 need
 to
 be
 on
 the


drug
 anymore.
 Some
 people
 will
 find
 that


it
 lasts
 for
 a
 while,
 and
 the
 cravings


start
 to
 come
 back.
 All
 right.
 Well,


let's
 cycle
 you
 back
 on
 and
 try
 again.


Let's
 find
 out
 what
 didn't
 work
 this


time.
 So,
 we're
 about
 to
 publish
 a


report.
 Anyone
 who
 wants
 to
 see
 a
 little


more
 about
 this,
 I
 just
 encourage
 them


to
 go
 to
 my
 site,
 insulinq.com.


>> I'll
 link
 it
 below.


>> Great.
 Um,
 but
 we
 have
 done
 a
 a


collaborative
 work
 with
 a
 group
 in


Idaho,
 a
 clinic
 in
 Idaho,
 where
 they


have
 done
 just
 this.
 They
 have
 people


getting
 low
 carb
 counseling
 with
 a


cycled
 do
 low
 dose
 of
 GLP1
 and
 the


results
 vastly
 outperform
 those
 who
 just


rely
 on
 the
 drug.
 Better
 fat
 loss
 and


better
 retention
 of
 muscle
 mass.


>> And
 when
 you
 say
 low
 carb
 counseling,


that's
 just


>> it's
 just
 people
 like
 me,
 you
 know,
 me


saying,
 "Stephen,
 I'd
 like
 to
 go
 on
 a


low
 carb
 diet."
 You
 saying,
 "Okay,


great.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 how
 you
 can
 do


it
 best."
 Kind
 of
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 what


we've
 been
 doing,
 but
 basically
 just


like
 a
 diet
 coach.


>> Okay.


>> But
 the
 results
 have
 been
 fantastic.
 Um,


literally
 outperforming
 just
 the
 drug


trials
 alone.


>> Over
 what
 period
 of
 time?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 it's
 now
 been
 we
 have
 people


who
 have
 been
 two
 to
 three
 years.


>> Yeah.
 We'll
 publish
 that
 soon.
 It's
 not


submitted
 yet.


>> All
 I
 had
 to
 do
 was
 brain
 dump.
 Imagine


if
 you
 had
 someone
 with
 you
 at
 all
 times


that
 could
 take
 the
 ideas
 you
 have
 in


your
 head,
 synthesize
 them
 with
 AI
 to


make
 them
 sound
 better
 and
 more


grammatically
 correct
 and
 write
 them


down
 for
 you.
 This
 is
 exactly
 what


Whisper
 Flow
 is
 in
 my
 life.
 It
 is
 this


thought
 partner
 that
 helps
 me
 explain


what
 I
 want
 to
 say.
 And
 it
 now
 means


that
 on
 the
 go,
 when
 I'm
 alone
 in
 my


office,
 when
 I'm
 out
 and
 about,
 I
 can


respond
 to
 emails
 and
 Slack
 messages
 and


WhatsApps
 and
 everything
 across
 all
 of


my
 devices
 just
 by
 speaking.
 I
 love
 this


tool.
 And
 I
 started
 talking
 about
 this


on
 my
 behindthe-scenes
 channel
 a
 couple


of
 months
 back.
 And
 then
 the
 founder


reached
 out
 to
 me
 and
 said,
 "We're


seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 come
 to
 our
 tour


because
 of
 you.
 So,
 we'd
 love
 to
 be
 a


sponsor.
 We'd
 love
 you
 to
 be
 an
 investor


in
 the
 company."
 And
 so,
 I
 signed
 up
 for


both
 of
 those
 offers.
 and
 I'm
 now
 an


investor
 and
 a
 huge
 partner
 in
 a
 company


called
 Whisper
 Flow.
 You
 have
 to
 check


it
 out.
 Whisper
 Flow
 is
 four
 times


faster
 than
 typing.

 You
 know,
 every
 once


in
 a
 while
 you
 come
 across
 a
 product


that
 has
 such
 a
 huge
 impact
 on
 your
 life


that
 you'd
 probably
 describe
 as
 a


gamecher.
 And
 I
 would
 say
 for
 about
 35


to
 40%
 of
 my
 team,
 they
 would
 currently


describe
 this
 product
 that
 I
 have
 in


front
 of
 me
 called
 Ketone
 IQ,
 which
 you


can
 get
 at
 ketone.com


as
 a
 game
 changer.
 But
 the
 reason
 I


became
 a
 co-owner
 of
 this
 company
 and


the
 reason
 why
 they
 they
 now
 are
 a


sponsor
 of
 this
 podcast
 is
 because
 one


day
 when
 I
 came
 to
 work,
 there
 was
 a
 box


of
 this
 stuff
 sat
 on
 my
 desk.
 I
 had
 no


idea
 what
 it
 was.
 Lily
 and
 my
 team
 says


that
 this
 company
 have
 been
 in
 touch.
 So


I
 went
 upstairs,
 tried
 it,
 and
 quite


frankly,
 the
 rest
 is
 history.
 in
 terms


of
 my
 focus,
 my
 energy
 levels,
 how
 I


feel,
 how
 I
 work,
 how
 productive
 I
 am.


Game
 changer.

 you

 Ketone
 IQ
 at
 Target
 stores


across
 the
 United
 States
 where
 your


first

 is
 completely
 free
 of
 charge.


I
 have
 a
 bunch
 of
 other
 things
 here
 on


the
 table
 that
 my
 team
 have
 got
 me
 and


they
 didn't
 tell
 me
 why
 they've
 got
 me


these
 which
 I
 think
 is
 useful
 because


this
 means
 that
 I
 can
 ask
 questions
 that


the
 viewer
 might
 have.
 What
 the
 hell
 is


this?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So
 alulose
 is


>> for
 anyone
 that
 can't
 see
 it's
 a
 white.


>> So
 if
 you
 you
 could
 lick
 it.
 Lick
 your


finger.
 You
 could
 put
 it
 in.
 It's
 going


to
 taste
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 a
 kind
 of


diluted
 sugar.
 It's
 just
 a
 sweetener.


>> Okay.


>> It's
 not
 quite
 as
 sweet
 as
 sugar.
 If
 it


is
 actually
 alulose
 maybe.


>> I'm
 so


>> Maybe
 it's
 not.
 Definitely.


>> Oh,
 I'm
 so
 sorry.


>> This
 is
 definitely
 a
 prop.
 It
 tastes


like
 bleach.


>> It's
 not
 bleach,
 is
 it?


>> No,
 it
 tastes
 awful,
 though.
 It
 tastes


like
 um


>> Oh
 my
 gosh.
 Sorry.


>> They
 labeled
 it
 alulose,
 but
 it
 tastes


like
 the
 thing
 that
 you
 use
 to
 clean


your
 clothes.


>> Baking
 powder.


>> Oh,
 it's
 baking
 powder.


>> Okay.
 So,
 at least
 it's
 not
 going
 to


kill
 you.
 Oh
 my
 gosh.
 If
 it
 were
 bleach,


you
 need
 to
 go
 rinse
 your
 mouth.


>> That
 was
 the
 end
 of
 the
 podcast.


>> Oh
 my
 god.


>> Yeah.
 Ben
 Dickman
 kills
 Steve
 Bartlett.


>> Okay.
 I
 didn't
 know
 that.
 I'm
 so
 sorry.


So,


>> Alulos.
 Alulose
 is
 a
 it's
 a
 sugar


replacement.
 It's
 what's
 called
 a
 rare


sugar.
 Um,
 by
 that
 I
 mean
 it
 exists
 in


nature.
 It
 is
 a
 sugar-like
 molecule.
 It


tastes
 sweet
 and
 yet
 it
 it
 is
 non-


metabolizable.
 It
 it
 doesn't
 get
 taken


into
 the
 body
 and
 it's
 not
 calories
 you


need
 to
 worry
 about.
 But
 what
 it
 does
 in


the
 context
 of
 this
 discussion
 is
 that


it
 will
 go
 further
 in
 the
 intestines
 and


elicit
 a
 significant
 increase
 in
 GLP-1


production.
 So,
 this
 would
 be
 one
 of
 the


ways
 that
 someone
 listening
 who
 may
 be


even
 on
 a
 GLP-1
 drug
 and
 thinking,
 I


need
 an
 exit.
 I
 want
 to
 get
 off
 this


drug.
 I
 can't
 afford
 it
 or
 I
 feel


miserable.
 I'm
 tired
 of
 the
 nausea.
 Um,


using
 alulose
 either
 as
 a
 sweetener
 in
 a


coffee
 or
 a
 tea
 or
 your
 baking
 or


whatever
 is
 a
 way
 to
 increase
 your
 GLP1


naturally.
 So,
 is
 your
 mate
 that
 I'm
 I'm


drinking
 now
 that
 I
 start
 every
 morning


with
 that
 has
 been
 shown.
 We've


published
 a
 couple
 reports
 on
 that.
 That


works
 as
 well.


>> And
 what
 foods
 have
 also
 in
 them?
 Yeah,


alulose
 is
 not
 something
 that
 you're


going
 to
 get
 naturally.
 It
 has
 to
 be


>> added.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 added.
 But
 there
 are
 some


like
 there
 are
 some
 yogurts
 now
 that


have
 it.
 There
 are
 a
 few
 supplements


that
 will
 use
 it
 as
 its
 sweetener
 and
 I


encourage
 that
 development.
 It's
 a
 good


sweetener
 to
 use.


>> Okay.
 This
 other
 chemical
 that
 my
 team


have
 got
 here,
 which
 is
 again,
 it's
 a
 a


white
 powder.


>> I'm
 not
 going
 to
 try
 it
 this
 time
 just


in
 case
 it's
 something
 awful.


>> Um
 says
 has
 a
 label
 on
 it
 that
 says


collagen
 peptide.
 Yeah.


>> Why
 have
 they
 got
 this?


>> Yeah.
 So
 collagen
 peptides
 are
 another


way
 to
 increase
 GLP-1.
 So
 that
 would
 be


another
 signal
 here
 that
 if
 someone
 is


interested
 in
 a
 good
 smart
 way
 of
 losing


weight,
 I
 am
 a
 fan
 of
 collagen.
 There


was
 in
 fact
 just
 a
 paper
 just
 published


this
 week
 finding
 that
 a
 mix
 of
 collagen


and
 various
 amino
 acids
 um
 was
 very


effective
 at
 enhancing
 skin
 integrity


and
 the
 collagen
 in
 the
 skin.
 So
 I'm
 a


fan
 of
 collagen
 peptides.
 Are
 there
 any


supplements
 that
 we
 haven't
 mentioned


that
 you're
 a
 big
 fan
 of
 in
 terms
 of


weight
 loss?


>> Yeah,
 I'm
 I
 already
 mentioned
 a
 Go
 BHB,


so
 an
 exogenous
 ketone
 source.
 Uh
 I
 do


take
 collagen
 um
 as
 well.
 Um
 it's
 called


iron
 feather.
 I
 love
 it.
 Um
 but
 also


omega-3
 in
 addition
 to
 other
 habits
 like


the
 the
 yerba
 mate,
 which
 I
 love
 and


other
 things
 like
 that.
 I
 don't
 call
 it


a
 supplement
 as
 much
 as
 just
 a
 habit.


>> What
 about
 creatine?


>> Oh,
 yes.
 Yes.
 I
 I'm
 I I
 can't
 believe
 I


didn't
 mention
 that.
 I'm
 very
 much
 an


advocate
 of
 creatine.
 In
 fact,
 we
 have
 a


study
 going
 on
 right
 now
 on
 it,
 which


I'll
 come
 back
 to
 in
 a
 second.
 Um
 yeah,


creatine
 has
 been
 um
 it's
 kind
 of
 the


new
 thing
 where
 its
 traditional
 use
 had


been
 in
 muscle
 and
 then
 now
 all
 of
 the


hot
 evidence
 is
 coming
 out
 in
 the
 brain.


So
 in
 the
 muscle
 evidence,
 there's
 two


things
 to
 note.
 In
 fact,
 the
 first
 one


is
 generic
 where
 creatine,
 not
 that


you're
 asking
 this,
 but
 people
 may


wonder
 how
 it
 works.
 Creatine
 will
 be


taken
 into
 a
 cell
 and
 it
 creates
 this


pool
 of
 potential
 energy
 called
 creatine


phosphate.
 Now,
 earlier
 I'd
 mentioned


ATP
 and
 I'm
 holding
 up
 three
 fingers


because
 of
 the
 three
 phosphates
 on
 that


ATP,
 the
 triphosphate
 molecule.


When
 we
 say
 contract
 a
 muscle
 or
 a
 nerve


is
 sending
 a
 signal,
 you're
 breaking
 ATP


apart.
 You're
 splitting
 off
 one
 of
 those


phosphates.
 Now,
 you're
 left
 with
 a


diphosphate,
 ADP.
 In
 order
 to
 recycle
 or


regenerate
 the
 ATP,
 you
 need
 another


phosphate
 molecule.
 And
 this
 is
 where


creatine
 comes
 in
 because
 creatine
 has
 a


phosphate
 now
 that
 it
 can
 come
 and
 give


to
 the
 ATP.
 rapidly
 recycling
 ATP


>> which
 means


>> so
 you're
 able
 to
 restore
 the
 energy
 in


the
 cell
 sooner


>> which
 means
 for
 me
 on
 a
 daily
 basis


>> on
 a
 daily
 basis
 would
 it'
 be
 two
 things


uh
 in
 the
 two
 tissues
 of
 interest
 one


you
 can
 get
 more
 work
 out
 of
 your
 muscle


in
 a
 given
 unit
 of
 time
 yeah


>> so
 if
 you
 wanted
 to
 have
 a
 very


effective
 30-minute
 workout
 your
 rests


could
 be
 much
 shorter
 because
 of
 your


ability
 to
 regenerate
 ATP
 or
 recover
 but


then
 the
 newest
 area
 of
 research
 is


what's
 happening
 in
 the
 brain
 where


creatine
 has
 been
 shown
 to
 increase


brain
 energy
 and
 there
 are
 some


incredible
 human
 studies
 finding
 that


you
 take
 people
 with
 cognitive
 decline


or
 some
 form
 of
 early
 dementia.
 Give


them
 creatine
 supplementation
 and
 over


the
 next
 few
 weeks
 their
 cognition
 will


improve.
 So,
 as
 much
 as
 you
 have
 the
 gym


bros
 who
 are
 taking
 it
 for
 muscle,
 which


I'm
 sympathetic
 to,
 I
 want
 big
 healthy


muscles,
 too.
 Um,
 more
 than
 anything,


you
 and
 I,
 we're
 not
 getting
 paid


because
 of
 our
 muscles.
 We're
 getting


paid
 because
 of
 our
 brains.
 So,
 you
 and


I
 are
 taking
 creatine
 to
 have
 bigger,


better
 brains.
 But
 in
 order
 for
 the


creatine
 to
 saturate
 the
 brain,
 you
 need


more.
 And
 that's
 been
 some
 of
 the
 newest


focus
 where
 you
 can
 get
 away
 if
 you're


just
 taking
 it
 for
 muscle
 purposes,
 five


grams
 is
 enough
 of
 creatine
 monohydrate.


And
 if
 you
 want
 to
 get
 it
 to
 work
 for


the
 brain,
 you
 need
 10
 or
 15
 grams.
 So


quite
 a
 bit
 more.


>> I
 heard
 this
 from
 another
 guest
 I
 had
 on


the
 show
 and
 I
 was
 really
 shocked
 um


because
 I
 didn't
 think
 about
 creatine
 as


being
 something
 that
 could
 really


elevate
 my
 cognitive
 performance.
 And


from
 the
 studies
 that
 I've
 read
 in
 the


research
 ahead
 of
 this
 conversation,
 I


read
 that
 creatine
 helps
 your
 brain
 stay


sharp,
 especially
 when
 you're
 in
 a
 low


sleep


>> Yes.


>> mode
 or
 when
 you've
 been
 working
 very


very
 hard.
 So
 that's
 a
 study.
 There's
 a


human
 study
 that
 to
 sleepd
 deprived


people
 deliberately
 had
 them
 take


creatine
 versus
 the
 placebo
 and
 then
 do


a
 series
 of
 cognitive
 tests.
 No


surprise,
 the
 sleepd
 deprived
 people
 on


placebo
 did
 very
 poorly.
 They're
 so


tired.
 They're
 lethargic.
 the
 creatine


treatment
 group
 performed
 much
 better.


>> I
 heard
 this
 and
 I
 thought,
 "Wow,
 so


when
 I'm
 like
 jetlagged
 or
 underslept,
 I


should
 be
 taking
 my
 creatine."


>> Yeah.
 And
 so,
 as
 an
 underslept
 dad,


you'll
 get
 there
 soon
 enough.
 Um,
 I
 take


creatine
 every
 morning.
 It
 is
 literally


the
 first
 thing
 I
 I
 drink.


>> It's
 hard
 for
 um
 I've
 noticed
 just
 in
 my


friendship
 group
 when
 I've
 talked
 about


creatine,
 it's
 sometimes
 hard
 to


convince
 women
 to
 take
 creatine
 because


there's
 a
 sort
 of
 prevailing
 stereotype


that
 it
 makes
 you
 large.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 wish
 um
 cuz
 then
 I'd
 be


jacked.
 No,
 no,
 it
 doesn't.
 In
 fact,
 I


think
 you
 could
 make
 the
 case
 that
 a


woman
 relevant
 to
 the
 cognitive
 aspects


of
 it
 should
 be
 focused
 on
 it
 more
 than


men.
 So,
 there
 are
 few
 chronic
 diseases


that
 women
 suffer
 from
 more
 than
 men
 and


Alzheimer's
 disease
 is
 one
 of
 them.
 So,


this
 is
 a
 disease
 that
 will
 affect
 women


almost
 double
 or
 even
 triple
 the
 rate
 of


it
 affecting
 men.
 In
 so
 far
 as
 the


latest
 evidence
 shows
 that
 at
 higher


doses,
 creatine
 helps
 with
 cognition,
 I


think
 every
 woman,
 middle-aged
 and


beyond,
 should
 be
 taking
 creatine
 daily.


And
 indeed,
 on
 the
 higher
 end
 of
 that


dose,
 because
 that's
 the
 dose
 you
 need


to
 help
 your
 brain.


>> And
 I
 read
 from
 one
 particular
 study,
 I


think
 you
 talked
 about
 this
 on
 your


YouTube
 channel,
 that
 creatine
 increases


strength
 by
 up
 to
 10%
 and
 power
 output


by
 up
 to
 15%
 and
 reduces
 muscle
 damage


by
 20
 to
 40%
 after
 intense
 exercise.


>> Yeah.
 So
 creatine
 both
 acts
 as
 an


energetic
 source
 and
 it
 changes
 gene
 uh


transcription.
 So
 there's
 evidence
 to


show
 that
 creatine
 in
 muscle
 stimulates


what's
 called
 myiogenic
 genes.
 Myiogenic


genes
 are
 those
 genes
 that
 promote


muscle
 protein
 synthesis
 and
 muscle


growth.
 So
 creatine
 both
 energizes
 the


muscle
 and
 promotes
 growth
 of
 the


muscle.
 Now
 a
 woman
 may
 say,
 "Well,
 I


don't
 want
 to
 get
 big."
 You
 can't
 get


big.
 The
 female
 a
 female
 body
 does
 not


have
 the
 right
 mix
 of
 sex
 hormones
 to


get
 big
 muscles.
 All
 that
 will
 happen
 is


she'll
 have
 wonderful
 healthy
 strong


muscles.
 She
 does.
 No
 woman
 ever
 needs


to
 be
 worried
 about
 getting
 too
 big
 in


muscles.
 It
 doesn't
 happen.


>> Why
 do
 vegetarians
 and
 vegans
 need
 to


pay
 more
 attention
 to
 creatine?


>> Right.
 That
 is
 Yeah.
 So
 creatine
 is
 one


of
 the
 many
 things,
 if
 you'll
 pardon
 me


for
 saying
 it,
 that
 a
 vegan
 would
 need


to
 pay
 attention
 to.
 Um
 so
 creatine
 is
 a


molecule
 that
 you
 can
 eat.
 So,
 if


someone's
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 red
 meat,
 you


could
 make
 the
 case
 that
 they
 don't
 need


to
 supplement,
 that
 they're
 getting
 more


than
 enough.
 But
 if
 you're
 not
 eating


red
 meat,
 you
 may
 not
 be
 getting
 enough.


And
 I'd
 say
 you
 probably
 aren't.
 And


there's
 reason
 to
 get
 it


>> and


>> to
 supplement.


>> Does
 creatine
 have
 an
 impact
 on
 blood


sugar
 levels?


>> No.


>> Blood
 sugar
 spikes
 at
 all?


>> No.


>> I
 would
 say
 if
 someone
 ever
 notices,
 if


they're
 taking
 a
 scoop
 of
 creatine
 and


they
 see,
 then
 it's
 probably
 because
 you


have
 some
 maltodextrin
 in
 your
 creatine


powder.
 Do
 you
 know
 I
 I
 had
 my
 um
 blood


levels
 done
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks
 ago
 and


the
 doctor
 said
 to
 me
 that
 I
 should
 be


careful
 because
 they're
 seeing
 high


levels
 of
 creatine
 in
 my
 kidney.


>> Okay.
 Yes.
 So
 what
 they
 would
 have
 said


is
 they
 would
 have
 seen
 high
 levels
 of


creatinine.


>> That
 was
 it.


>> Yeah.
 But
 that's
 important
 for
 people
 to


know
 because
 that's
 one
 of
 the


long-standing
 attacks
 against
 creatine


has
 been
 a
 high
 level
 of
 creatinine.


>> That
 was
 it.


>> So
 creatinine
 is
 the
 metabolite
 of


creatine.
 So
 when
 creatine
 has
 lived
 its


life
 and
 served
 its
 purpose,
 it
 gets


converted
 into
 a
 molecule
 called


creatinine
 which
 is
 actively
 secreted


from
 the
 kidneys.
 Now
 it's
 a
 waste


product
 and
 the
 kidneys
 happily
 dump
 it


out.
 Now
 in
 an
 average
 person,
 if


someone
 has
 if
 you
 came
 in
 and
 you
 did
 a


urine
 test
 and
 we
 found
 your
 creatine


your
 creatinine
 levels
 were
 really


really
 high,
 we
 would
 worry,
 hey,
 is


this
 a
 sign
 of
 kidney
 damage?
 Are
 your


kidneys
 allowing
 too
 much
 to
 get


filtered?
 And
 and
 it
 might
 be
 a
 sign
 of


that.
 However,
 if
 a
 person's
 taking


creatine,
 it
 is
 absolutely
 guaranteed


that
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 more


creatinine
 coming
 out,
 and
 that's
 just


because
 they're
 metabolizing
 more
 of
 the


creatine.
 There's
 no
 reason
 to
 be


worried
 about
 it.


>> You
 talked
 about
 a
 5-year
 study
 that


found
 zero
 kidney
 changes
 in
 athletes


taking
 up
 to
 20
 gram
 of


>> which
 is
 significant


>> creatine
 a
 day.


>> Yeah.
 There's
 no
 evidence.
 I'm
 unaware


of
 any
 study
 that
 has
 shown
 kidney


damage
 on
 creatine
 supplementation.
 It


is
 what
 we
 call
 in
 science
 an
 artifact


where
 you
 see
 a
 little
 hint
 of
 a
 problem


and
 assume
 it's
 it's
 actually
 causing
 a


problem
 when
 it's
 actually
 just
 a


manifestation
 of
 just
 what
 you're
 doing.


>> Ben,
 I'm
 going to
 ask
 you
 to
 close
 your


eyes.


>> I'm
 ready.


>> Okay.
 And
 I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 you
 to
 embody


what
 I'm
 about
 to
 say.
 Okay.


>> So,
 suddenly
 now
 you
 are
 a
 let's
 say


35year-old


man
 and
 your
 name
 is
 Dave
 and
 you
 have


one
 kid.
 You
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 extra


fat
 around
 your
 midsection
 that
 you're


trying
 to
 lose.
 You've
 been
 listening
 to


this
 podcast
 for
 a
 while.
 You've
 heard


lots
 of
 things.
 You
 haven't
 managed
 to


make
 huge
 amount
 of
 progress.
 Sometimes


you
 try
 and
 then
 you
 bounce
 right
 back


>> and
 you're
 you're
 kind
 of
 at
 your
 wit's


end.
 You
 really
 really
 want
 2026
 to
 be


the
 year
 that
 you
 finally
 prove
 to


yourself,
 your
 family,
 for
 the
 sake
 of


your
 kids
 and
 inspiring
 them
 to
 live
 a


happy,
 healthier
 future.
 That
 you
 can


make
 a
 change
 and
 you
 can
 become
 the


strong,
 healthy,
 sexy


>> dad
 that
 your
 family
 wants
 you
 to
 be
 and


that
 you
 want
 to
 be.
 You
 want
 to
 finally


prove
 it
 to
 yourself
 after
 all
 these


years
 of
 struggling,
 trying,
 failing.


What
 is
 what
 is
 it
 that
 that
 guy
 or
 that


woman
 needs
 to
 hear
 to
 close
 out
 this


conversation
 today,
 Ben?


>> Yeah.


Um,
 I
 appreciate
 you
 mentioning
 the
 the


the
 kid.
 I
 think
 you
 need
 to
 have
 a


reason


because
 making
 change
 is
 hard.
 You
 have


to
 have
 a
 reason
 that
 is
 that
 is


motivating
 you
 to
 do
 it.
 That
 goes


beyond
 yourself.
 That's
 I
 should
 add


that
 that
 you'd
 mentioned
 a
 handful
 of


internal
 motivations.
 You
 want
 to
 feel


better.
 you
 want
 to
 look
 better.
 Those


are
 all
 valid,
 but
 sometimes
 it's
 not


enough.
 Have
 an
 external
 reason.
 And


when
 you're
 a
 parent,
 you
 have
 a
 reason.


You
 have
 a
 child.
 You're
 living
 for
 your


child.
 So,
 have
 a
 reason
 for
 doing
 what


you're
 doing
 that
 goes
 beyond
 your
 own


motivations
 and
 that
 touches
 someone


else's
 life.
 And
 then
 two,


you
 need
 to
 find
 a
 way
 to
 control
 your


cravings.
 I
 think
 the
 more
 I
 look
 at
 the


debates
 around
 obesity
 and
 weight
 loss,


um,
 which
 is
 so
 central
 to
 looking
 and


feeling
 better,
 the
 more
 I
 think
 you


have
 to
 learn
 to
 control
 what
 you're


addicted
 to.
 And
 so
 I
 would
 say
 start


with
 the
 simplest
 habit
 and
 and
 change


it.
 So,
 if
 this
 is
 if
 if
 Dave,
 the


35-year-old
 dad
 of
 one,
 if
 he
 finds
 that


he
 is
 starting
 to
 drink
 alcohol
 in
 the


evening
 and
 then
 he's
 doing
 other
 things


too
 that
 he
 doesn't
 like,
 stop
 doing


that.
 Um,
 and
 recruit
 outside
 help.
 So,


start
 with
 one
 habit
 you
 know
 you
 should


change
 and
 change
 it.
 And
 then
 that
 can


when
 it
 comes
 to
 changing
 diet,
 which
 is


among
 the
 hardest
 things
 to
 do
 for
 many


people,


I
 would
 say
 eat
 a
 big
 lunch.


Some
 people
 don't
 want
 to
 make
 small


changes
 because
 they
 don't
 feel


consequential
 enough.
 It
 doesn't
 feel


like
 it
 matters.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 know,
 and
 this
 is
 one
 of the
 things


again
 I've
 learned
 from
 interviewing
 so


many
 people
 is
 that


>> all
 of
 these
 habits
 are
 like
 at
 some


level
 interconnected.


>> And
 actually
 when
 you
 change
 one,
 you


influence
 another.


>> I
 totally
 agree.


>> And
 actually
 huge
 change
 in
 life
 starts


with
 small
 steps.


And
 so
 cutting
 out
 the
 alcohol
 for


example,
 that's
 going
 to
 have
 knock-on


effects
 in
 other
 areas
 of
 life,
 right?


Even
 like
 sleep
 or


>> he
 will
 sleep
 much
 better.
 Yes.
 So


multiple
 studies
 show
 that
 with
 cutting


people
 have
 a
 have
 a
 mistaken
 view
 of


alcohol
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 sleep
 where


they
 they
 fall
 asleep
 faster
 but
 then


they
 sleep
 worse
 throughout
 the
 rest
 of


the
 night.
 So
 there's


>> which
 then
 means
 what?


>> Yeah.
 So
 that
 men
 So
 then
 you
 wake
 up


the
 next
 morning
 and
 you're
 lethargic,


you're
 tired,
 your
 cortisol
 will
 be


higher,
 you
 will
 be
 more
 insulin


resistant.
 So,
 higher
 insulin
 levels


throughout
 the
 day,


>> which
 means
 you're
 going
 to
 have


cravings,


>> which
 means
 you'll
 have
 cravings.
 And


every
 calorie
 you
 consume,
 you're
 going


to
 be
 more
 likely
 to
 store
 it.
 So,
 then


your
 body
 is
 more
 efficient
 at
 getting


fat
 on
 any
 given
 amount
 of
 calories.
 So,


even
 even
 something
 as
 simple
 as


alcohol,
 which
 you
 and
 I
 haven't


discussed
 at
 all,
 and
 and
 maybe
 Dave


isn't
 an
 alcohol
 drinker,
 but
 many


people
 are,
 uh,
 that
 is
 it
 has
 this


patina
 of
 helping
 a
 person's
 sleep,
 and


yet
 it
 absolutely
 does
 not.
 And
 sleep
 is


a
 massively
 relevant
 variable
 when
 it


comes
 to
 uh
 metabolic
 health
 and
 weight


loss
 and
 just
 feeling
 well.


>> What
 about
 stress?
 That's
 a
 protagonist


in
 the
 story
 that
 we
 haven't
 talked


about,
 but
 I
 know
 it
 dovetales
 into


ketones
 and


>> Oh,
 it
 sure
 is.
 Weight
 loss.


>> So,
 in
 fact,
 it's
 a
 perfect
 segue


because
 sleep
 deprivation,
 I
 believe,
 is


the
 leading
 cause
 of
 stress.
 And
 stress


is
 one
 of
 the
 three
 cardinal
 causes
 of


what
 I
 call
 fast
 insulin
 resistance.


When
 the
 body
 becomes
 insulin
 resistant


in
 like
 hours,
 stress
 is
 one
 of
 them.


and
 poor
 sleep
 is
 the
 main
 cause.
 And
 so


in
 this
 case,
 a
 person
 could
 look,
 let's


say
 Dave
 is
 not
 sleeping
 well.
 There
 are


actually
 the
 problem
 with
 stress
 is
 that


it's
 hard
 to
 define
 that
 they're
 going


to
 bed
 and
 they're
 not
 feeling
 very


great
 and
 they're
 worried
 about
 stuff


and
 and
 if
 I
 were
 to
 tell
 him,
 Dave,


reduce
 your
 stress.


>> Well,
 now
 he's
 even
 more
 stressed


because
 he
 doesn't
 know
 how
 to
 do
 it.


This
 is
 where
 I
 think
 another


opportunity
 for
 some
 smart


supplementation
 can
 come
 in
 where
 there


are
 these
 adaptogen
 like
 molecules
 in


nature
 like
 ashwagandha.
 So
 I
 just
 tried


an
 ashwagandha
 source
 in
 the
 form
 of
 a


little
 gummy,
 a
 goalie
 gummy
 and
 it
 had


enough
 like
 a
 full
 kind
 of
 therapeutic


dose
 of
 ashwagandha
 and
 it's
 in
 the
 form


of
 a
 delicious
 little
 gummy
 you
 know
 so


you
 don't
 have
 to
 take
 this
 bitter


tasting
 powder
 from
 an
 ashwagandha
 root


you
 can
 take
 a
 gummy
 and
 then
 you
 sleep


a
 little
 better
 because
 it's
 been
 shown


in
 humans
 to
 improve
 sleep
 latency


improve
 improve
 sleep
 architecture
 and


it
 could
 be
 one
 of
 the
 mechanisms
 is


that
 it's
 just
 suppressing
 your
 cortisol


response.
 So
 if
 if
 Dave
 or
 anyone
 is


feeling
 that
 that
 would
 just
 be
 one
 more


strategy
 to
 address
 your
 metabolic


health
 that
 you
 would
 sort
 of
 t
 take
 the


small
 steps
 you
 can
 the
 little
 wins
 and


maybe
 he's
 saying
 all
 right
 I
 need
 to


sleep
 a
 little
 better.
 I'm
 going to
 cut


my
 alcohol.
 I'm
 going
 to
 take
 a
 little
 a


couple
 of
 these
 ashwagandha
 gummies


before
 I
 go
 to
 bed
 and
 not
 eat
 before
 I


go
 to
 bed
 so
 I
 don't
 go
 to
 bed


hypoglycemic.
 You'll
 start
 to
 sleep
 a


little
 better.
 You'll
 wake
 up
 the
 next


day
 ready
 to
 kind
 of
 win
 the
 day.
 Is


there
 a
 relationship
 with
 ketones
 and


stress?


>> Yeah,
 there
 is
 in
 that
 ketones
 help.
 So,


ketones
 are
 more
 and
 more
 called
 an


anxolytic.
 That's
 a
 technical
 term
 for


reducing
 anxiety.
 It
 has
 been
 shown
 to


be
 a
 direct
 effect.
 So,
 BHB,
 the
 main


ketone,
 acts
 as
 a
 signaling
 molecule
 and


will
 come
 to
 the
 brain
 and
 reduce
 the


stress
 hormone
 signaling.


>> What
 is
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 we


didn't
 talk
 about
 that
 we
 should
 have


talked
 about,
 Ben?


Um,


>> as
 it
 relates
 to
 that
 person
 who's


looking
 to
 make
 a
 change
 once
 and
 for


all,


>> one
 thing
 I
 would
 add,
 if
 if
 we
 go
 back


to
 the
 middle-aged
 guy
 who's
 just
 trying


to
 be
 the
 best
 version
 of
 himself,
 part


of
 it
 might
 be
 his
 testosterone
 levels


and
 and
 that
 is
 worth
 getting
 checked.


So,
 as
 much
 as
 we
 focus,
 you've
 had
 in


the
 past
 very
 good
 conversations
 about


women's
 health,
 including
 menopause,
 men


have
 their
 own
 version
 of
 it.
 um
 albeit


more
 modest,
 but
 we
 could
 more


technically
 call
 it
 andropause,
 the
 male


version
 of
 it.
 But
 there
 is
 a
 steady


reduction
 in
 testosterone
 levels.
 And
 if


he
 finds
 that
 he
 is
 tired
 and
 he's


gaining
 weight,
 get
 your
 testosterone


checked.
 If
 it's
 actually
 low,
 lose
 a


little
 weight
 and
 the
 testosterone
 will


boost.
 But
 if
 you
 need
 help,
 there
 are


supplements
 that
 can
 even
 help
 with


testosterone
 production
 that
 go
 that
 you


could
 use
 before
 full-on
 testosterone


replacement
 therapy.
 Um,
 but
 ice
 bath,


an
 ice
 bath,
 I
 know
 guys
 who've
 doubled


their
 testosterone
 levels
 by
 doing
 ice


immersion,
 cold
 plunge,
 and
 then
 a


workout
 after
 their
 cold
 plunge.
 That's


a
 wicked
 awesome
 combination.


>> So,
 there
 are
 a
 couple
 of
 tests
 that


we've
 mentioned
 today.
 So,
 I
 just
 want


to
 summarize
 some
 of
 those
 tests.
 Can


people
 check
 their
 insulin
 levels
 at


home?


>> No.


>> No.


>> Not
 not
 really.
 There
 are
 some
 tests


that
 have
 been
 marketed
 for
 at
 home
 use,


but
 they're
 quite
 cumbersome,
 and
 I


would
 say
 they're
 not
 really
 ready
 for


mainstream
 yet.
 Okay.
 So,
 they
 have
 to


go
 to
 a
 doctor
 and
 get
 their
 test.
 You


do.


>> And
 then
 the
 testosterone,
 you
 can't


check
 that
 at
 home
 either.
 No.
 I
 guess


you
 could
 could
 you
 get
 sent
 something


in
 the
 post?


>> You
 can.
 Yeah.
 So,
 there's
 companies
 in


the
 US,
 uh,
 Blok
 and
 Joy,
 for example,


there's
 other
 services
 you
 can
 use
 where


you
 go
 online,
 sign
 up,
 and
 they
 send


you
 either
 a
 phabotamist
 or
 a
 little


thing
 nowadays
 that
 you
 just
 snap
 onto


your
 arm,
 press
 a
 little
 button,
 and


it'll
 fill
 the
 tube
 with
 blood,
 and
 you


just
 ship
 it
 back.


>> Are
 there
 any
 tests
 that
 you
 recommend


my
 audience
 get
 done?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 would
 say
 I
 am
 an
 enormous


advocate
 of
 measuring
 insulin.
 If
 I


could
 change
 any
 policy
 within
 the


United
 States
 and
 and
 worldwide,
 it


would
 be
 that
 as
 much
 as
 every
 blood


test
 you
 and
 I
 will
 go
 into
 a
 blood
 test


every
 time
 they'll
 measure
 our
 glucose


and
 our
 lipids
 like
 cholesterol
 and


triglycerides,
 they'll
 never
 measure


insulin.
 If
 I
 could
 have
 one
 change
 in


the
 US
 and
 the
 UK
 and
 everywhere
 else,


I'd
 say
 add
 insulin
 to
 that
 panel


because
 once
 we
 get
 insulin,
 we
 can


measure
 the
 fasted
 level
 and
 a
 person


wants
 to
 see
 it
 at
 around
 7
 microunits


per
 mill
 or
 less.
 That's
 a
 really
 really


good
 sign.
 So
 you
 look
 at
 your
 insulin


alone,
 but
 then
 with
 insulin
 and


glucose,
 you
 can
 do
 something
 called
 the


hom


ha
 the
 hom
 score
 and
 that's
 a
 really


good
 score
 of
 where
 you
 fall
 on
 the


insulin
 resistance
 spectrum.
 And
 do
 you


recommend
 that
 people
 try
 and
 wear
 a


continuous
 glucose
 monitor,
 which
 is
 a


device
 that
 costs
 $
 20,
 $30,
 you
 can
 get


it
 on
 everywhere
 online
 that
 stays
 on


your
 arm
 for
 14
 days
 and
 it
 it
 monitors


your
 glucose
 levels,
 say
 your
 blood


sugar
 levels.
 Do
 you
 recommend
 people
 do


that?


>> I
 do.
 I
 I
 think
 that
 the
 CGM
 a
 CGM
 is


one
 of
 the
 best
 ways
 for
 a
 person
 to


make
 their
 own
 changes.
 So,
 if
 you
 put
 a


CGM
 on
 your
 body,
 you're
 able
 to
 look
 at


your
 phone
 and
 see
 what's
 happening
 in


your
 blood.


>> A
 CGM
 being
 a
 continuous
 glucose


monitor.


>> A
 continuous
 glucose
 monitor.
 you're


getting
 a
 continuous
 measurement
 of
 your


glucose
 levels.
 I
 have
 seen
 more
 people


make
 changes
 of
 their
 own
 valition
 when


they
 just
 are
 wearing
 a
 CGM
 and
 they


don't
 need
 someone
 to
 be
 nagging
 them.


You
 know,
 you're
 you
 have
 that
 internal


motivation
 because
 you
 see
 what's


happening
 in
 your
 own
 body.


>> For
 anyone
 that's
 never
 tried
 it,
 I


highly
 recommend
 it.
 You
 I'll
 link
 a
 CGM


below
 in
 the
 comment
 section.
 Um
 I
 don't


have
 an
 affiliation
 to
 any
 CGMs,
 but


when
 you
 eat
 something
 within
 minutes,


usually
 you
 can
 see
 on
 your
 phone
 your


blood
 sugar
 levels
 rising.
 And
 it's
 for


me
 it
 was
 a
 really
 important
 and


informative
 14
 days
 with
 the
 CGM
 on
 my


arm
 because
 it
 I
 got
 to
 try
 things
 that


I
 have
 every
 single
 day
 and
 understand


my
 blood
 sugar
 relationship
 with
 those


things.
 So
 I
 got
 to
 try
 tomato
 ketchup


and
 then
 I
 got
 to
 try
 a
 Coke
 Zero
 and


then
 I
 don't know
 cheese
 and
 bananas
 and


fruit
 and
 I
 got
 to
 see
 within
 minutes


how
 much
 blood
 glucose
 was
 in
 my
 blood


and
 and
 that
 informed
 going
 forward
 for


the
 next
 couple
 of
 years
 the
 decisions


that
 I
 made
 in
 my
 life.


>> Yeah.
 and
 people
 who
 the
 nice
 thing


about
 it
 is
 you
 can
 stack
 it
 with
 other


technologies
 like
 let's
 say
 you're


wearing
 a
 Whoop.


>> Yeah.


>> AD.


>> One
 of
 the
 cool
 things
 with
 the
 CGM
 is


the
 ability
 to
 stack
 it
 with
 other


wearables.
 Well,
 where
 let's
 say
 that
 a


person
 notices
 that
 they
 with
 wearing
 a


Whoop
 that
 their
 HRV
 is
 suggesting
 that


they're
 stressed.
 And
 then
 you
 look
 at


that
 at
 the
 same
 time
 as
 your
 CGM.
 You


may
 find
 that
 what's
 causing
 you
 to
 feel


stressed
 could
 be
 your
 hypoglycemic


spike.
 And
 you
 wouldn't
 have
 known
 that


if
 it
 weren't
 for
 the
 CGM.
 So,
 I
 think


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 utility
 in
 stacking


some
 of
 these
 wearables.
 Someday
 they're


all
 going
 to
 be
 in
 one.
 Yeah.


>> Um,
 and
 they'll
 crack
 the
 code
 of
 doing


that.
 But,
 I
 think
 it
 really
 does
 lend


insight.
 I
 made
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


changes
 to
 my
 sleep
 by
 wearing
 a
 CGM


where
 I
 would
 sleep
 terribly.
 I'd
 be


monitoring
 my
 stress
 and
 find
 that,
 wow,


every
 time
 I
 sleep
 really
 poorly,
 my


blood
 glucose,
 I'd
 spike
 my
 blood


glucose
 in
 the
 evening.
 I'm
 going
 to
 try


cutting
 that
 out.
 And
 sure
 enough,
 I
 it


was
 the
 single
 greatest
 change
 of
 my


sleep
 habits.


>> Ben,
 we
 have a
 closing
 tradition
 on
 this


podcast
 that
 the
 last
 guest
 leaves
 a


question
 for
 the
 next
 guest,
 not
 knowing


who
 they're
 leaving
 it
 for.
 The
 question


left
 for
 you
 is,
 if
 you
 could
 have


anything
 in
 the
 world
 for
 the
 rest
 of


your
 life,
 what
 would
 it
 be
 and
 why?


And
 you
 can't
 say
 your
 family.


>> Ah,
 okay.
 I
 was
 going
 to
 ask
 for
 that


clarification.
 Okay.
 If
 I
 could
 have
 any


one
 thing,
 an
 item
 that's
 not
 a
 person,


um
 I
 would
 choose
 to
 have
 my
 uh
 my


scriptures,


these
 holy
 scriptures,
 um
 that
 I
 I
 read


every
 day.
 I
 believe
 a
 lot
 of
 my


happiness
 in
 life
 has
 come
 from
 my
 uh
 my


religious
 conviction
 and
 my
 belief
 in
 a


higher
 power
 and
 my
 faith
 in
 God.
 As
 a


scientist,
 it
 seems
 like
 too
 many
 people


want
 to
 describe
 faith
 as
 a
 negative


thing.
 But
 everything
 we
 do
 is
 based
 on


faith.
 Every
 action
 we
 take
 is
 a
 is
 a


faith
 in
 a
 hope
 that
 the
 consequence


will
 be
 one
 we
 want.
 And
 so
 for
 me,
 it


would
 be
 my
 scriptures.
 Just
 my
 way
 of


meditating
 and
 pondering
 my
 position
 in


the
 greater
 universe
 and
 my
 connection


with
 what
 I
 believe
 to
 be
 a
 God,
 a


loving
 heavenly
 father
 who
 cares
 about


me
 and
 that
 I
 can
 go
 to
 when
 I
 feel
 like


I
 need
 help.
 that
 goes
 beyond
 what
 I
 can


do
 with
 my
 own
 hands.


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 this
 is
 all
 about?


This
 life,
 what
 do
 you
 think
 the
 point


of
 this
 all
 of
 this
 is?


>> Oh,
 that's
 a
 big
 question.
 Um,
 I
 believe


it
 is
 to
 show
 our
 heavenly
 father
 that


we
 are
 capable
 of
 more
 that
 I
 have
 very


much
 a
 very
 clear
 um
 worldview
 that
 we


have
 a
 loving
 heavenly
 father
 that
 we


existed
 in
 a
 premortal
 state
 and
 that


our
 bodies
 this
 mortal
 experience
 is
 an


experience
 for
 us.
 We've
 been
 given
 this


much
 power.
 These
 bodies
 give
 us
 some


power.
 We
 have
 power
 over
 life.
 We
 have


power
 over
 death
 and
 all
 the
 temptations


that
 can
 come
 from
 addictions
 and
 habits


that
 are
 unique
 to
 this
 mortal


tabernacle.
 I
 think
 we've
 been
 given
 a


period
 of
 time
 to
 show
 that
 we
 can
 wield


power
 and
 control
 ourselves.


just
 assuming
 my
 my
 my
 religious
 view
 is


very
 much
 that
 just
 like
 my
 as
 a
 as
 a


father
 my
 great
 hope
 is
 that
 my
 children


will
 grow
 up
 to
 be
 wonderful
 mothers
 and


fathers
 that
 I
 want
 them
 to
 be
 able
 to


pattern
 their
 lives
 after
 what
 they
 see


in
 my
 wife
 and
 me.
 I
 believe
 that
 we


have
 a
 heavenly
 father
 and
 a
 heavenly


mother
 actually
 that
 the
 we
 have
 these


divine
 parents
 who
 want
 nothing
 more


than
 for
 their
 children
 to
 grow
 up
 and


be
 like
 them.
 And
 I
 think
 this
 is
 just


like
 my
 children
 will
 have
 to
 leave
 the


home.
 If
 I
 coddled
 them
 and
 protected


them
 and
 only
 let
 them
 stay
 in
 my
 home,


they'd
 never
 learn
 anything.
 They'd


never
 grow
 up
 because
 mom
 and
 dad
 are


doing
 everything.
 This
 I
 think
 mortal


life
 is
 our
 divine
 parents
 opportunity


to
 show
 to
 to
 help
 us
 grow
 up
 and
 then


the
 time
 will
 come
 for
 us
 to
 pass
 on
 and


we
 will
 come
 back
 to
 them.
 Hopefully


showing
 that
 we
 are
 ready
 to
 continue
 to


learn
 and
 progress
 and
 be
 more
 like


them.


>> To
 what
 end?
 For
 what
 reason?


>> To
 mimic
 what
 our
 heavenly
 parents
 have


been
 able
 to
 do
 where
 they
 they
 have


been
 able
 to
 create
 a
 world
 and
 populate


it
 with
 their
 spirit
 children.
 I
 want
 to


do
 that
 too.
 I
 you
 and
 I
 before
 we


started
 recording
 I
 joked
 about
 how
 much


I
 miss
 babies.
 I
 desperately
 and
 I
 do.


It
 is
 an
 ache
 in
 my
 soul
 that
 my


children
 are
 not
 little
 cuddly
 babies


anymore.
 Now
 they're
 darling
 children


nevertheless.
 But
 I
 miss
 babies.
 And
 to


me,
 heaven
 is
 my
 wife
 and
 I
 whom
 I
 love


having
 a
 family
 that
 never
 ends.
 and
 and


that
 we're
 able
 to


give
 life
 to
 this
 countless
 number
 of


future
 children.
 Um
 that
 someday
 we'll


be
 born
 on
 a
 world
 just
 like
 us.
 That's


a
 pretty
 cosmic
 grand
 view.
 But
 to
 me,


the
 purpose
 of
 life
 is
 to
 show
 Heavenly


Father
 that
 we
 are
 worthy
 of
 more
 and


not
 just
 end
 into
 a
 nihilistic
 blackness


when
 we
 die.


>> Thank
 you.
 We're
 done.


>> My
 pleasure.


If
 there's
 anything
 we
 need,
 it
 is


connection.
 Especially
 in
 the
 world


we're
 living
 in
 today.
 And
 that
 is


exactly
 why
 we
 created
 these


conversation
 cards.
 Because
 on
 this


show,
 when
 I
 sit
 here
 with
 my
 guest
 and


have
 those
 deep,
 intimate
 conversations,


this
 remarkable
 thing
 happens
 time
 and


time
 again.
 We
 feel
 deeply
 connected
 to


each
 other.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 every
 episode,


the
 guest
 I'm
 interviewing
 leaves
 a


question
 for
 the
 next
 guest,
 and
 we've


turned
 them
 into
 these
 conversation


cards.
 And
 we've
 added
 these
 twist
 cards


to
 make
 your
 conversations
 even
 more


interesting.
 And
 there
 are
 so
 many
 more


twists
 along
 the
 way
 with
 the


conversation
 cards.
 This
 is
 the
 brand


new
 edition.
 And
 for
 the
 first
 time


ever,
 I've
 added
 to
 the
 pack
 this
 gold


card,
 which
 is
 an
 exclusive
 question


from
 me.
 But
 I'm
 only
 putting
 the
 gold


cards
 in
 the
 first
 run
 of
 conversation


cards.
 So
 get
 yours
 now
 before
 the


limited
 edition
 gold
 cards
 are
 all
 gone.
