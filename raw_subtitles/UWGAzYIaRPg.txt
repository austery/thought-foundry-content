Have
 you
 ever
 been
 tossing
 and
 turning


in
 bed
 while
 your
 mind
 races
 trying
 to


work
 out
 the
 solution
 to
 a
 tricky


problem
 and
 then
 you
 wake
 up
 and
 the


answer
 is
 just
 there?
 Like
 somehow
 while


you
 were
 sleeping
 your
 brain
 figured
 it


out,
 no
 conscious
 thought
 required.
 So


how
 does
 that
 happen?
 We
 look
 at
 what


science
 has
 to
 say
 about
 the
 stuff
 that


dreams
 are
 made
 of.
 We
 still
 don't
 have


all
 the
 answers.
 No
 surprise
 because
 the


brain
 is
 incredibly
 complicated.
 And


even
 now,
 much
 of
 it
 remains
 a
 mystery


to
 scientists
 and
 philosophers
 alike.


But
 researchers
 are
 putting
 together


some
 pretty
 interesting
 pieces
 of
 the


puzzle
 and
 raising
 new
 sets
 of


questions.
 For
 example,
 a
 new


Ontario-based
 study
 finds
 that
 rates
 of


new
 diagnoses
 of
 psychotic
 disorders,


including
 schizophrenia,
 increased
 by


60%
 in
 people
 aged
 14
 to
 20
 over
 the


past
 few
 decades.
 We
 break
 down
 what
 the


data
 shows
 and
 what
 it
 may
 mean.
 Welcome


to
 the
 rundown.


A
 new
 study
 published
 in
 the
 Canadian


Medical
 Association
 Journal
 says
 that


between
 1997
 and
 2023,
 the
 annual


incidence
 of
 psychotic
 disorders


increased
 by
 60%
 among
 people
 aged
 14
 to


20.
 I
 sat
 down
 with
 one
 of
 the


co-authors
 to
 understand
 what
 the


numbers
 are
 telling
 us
 and
 the
 questions


they
 leave
 behind.


Dr.
 Paul
 Kuriak
 is
 a
 psychiatrist
 and


scientist
 at
 the
 Center
 for
 Addiction


and
 Mental
 Health
 in
 Toronto
 and
 a


senior
 scientist
 and
 lead
 of
 the
 mental


health
 and
 addictions
 research
 program


at
 ICE
 and
 he
 joins
 us
 in
 studio.
 How


are
 you
 sir?


>> Great.
 Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> All
 right.
 Your
 study
 measured
 the


incidence
 of
 psychotic
 disorders
 across


different
 groups
 in
 Ontario.
 When
 you


stepped
 back
 and
 looked
 at
 the
 findings,


what
 surprised
 you
 the
 most?


Well,
 I
 think
 the
 the
 first
 thing
 that


surprised
 me
 uh
 and
 I
 should
 say
 at
 the


beginning
 that
 I
 was
 a
 co-author
 on
 this


study
 um
 it
 was
 led
 by
 a
 colleague
 of


mine
 at
 a
 University
 of
 Ottawa,
 Dr.


Daniel
 Myin
 did
 a
 great
 job
 on
 this


project.
 When
 we
 looked
 at
 the
 findings,


the
 there
 are
 a
 couple
 things
 that


struck
 out.
 one
 is
 that
 um
 that
 that
 the


incidence
 which
 means
 the
 the
 rate
 of


new
 newly
 diagnosed
 individuals
 is


increasing
 over
 time.


>> Uh
 it
 is
 happening
 in
 younger


individuals
 over
 time.
 And
 then
 the


third
 piece
 is
 the
 the
 the
 way
 that
 the


diagnosis
 are
 breaking
 out.
 Uh,
 so
 there


are
 different
 types
 of
 diagnoses
 that


that
 are
 part
 of
 of
 what
 we
 call


psychotic
 disorders
 and
 and
 that's
 a
 bit


of
 a
 nuanced
 aspect
 of
 the
 study,
 but


that
 was
 a
 third
 piece
 that
 was
 kind
 of


interesting
 to
 us.


>> All right.
 Well,
 let's
 let's
 pick
 up
 on


that.
 When
 you
 say
 psychotic
 disorders,


what
 do
 we
 mean?
 We
 have
 schizophrenia


in
 one
 room,
 an
 umbrella
 term
 perhaps,


and
 then
 we
 have
 schizophrenia
 and
 we


have
 psychosis.
 Help
 us
 understand
 uh


sort
 of
 the
 terms
 there.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 so
 there's
 schizophrenia
 and


schizopeeffective
 disorders
 and
 for


people
 to
 be
 diagnosed
 with
 those
 uh


conditions
 they
 they
 need
 to
 meet


certain
 criteria
 and
 and
 that
 uh
 the
 the


incident
 rate
 for
 those
 diagnoses
 did


have
 increased
 a
 little
 bit
 but
 not
 that


much.
 The
 the
 one
 that's
 increased
 more


so
 is
 called
 psychosis
 not
 otherwise


specified.
 And
 this
 is
 a
 diagnosis
 that


clinicians
 like
 myself
 use
 when
 somebody


is
 clearly
 presenting
 with
 prominent


psychotic
 symptoms
 like
 a
 deviation
 from


reality.


>> Sorry,
 hallucinations,


>> delusions.
 Exactly.
 And
 uh
 but
 but
 they


but
 there
 are
 other
 issues
 that
 prevent


us
 from
 saying
 it
 is
 clearly


schizophrenia
 and
 schizoeffective


disorder.
 So,
 we
 know
 that
 the
 person's


psychotic,
 but
 there
 could
 be
 other


factors
 that
 that
 may
 ultimately
 be


contributing
 to
 it.
 Um,
 like
 it
 could
 be


related
 to
 substance
 use,
 it
 could
 be


related
 to
 medical
 conditions,
 etc.,


etc.
 So,
 so
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 hedge


diagnosis.
 It
 it
 is
 definitely
 a


psychotic
 disorder


>> and
 most
 individuals
 with
 this
 diagnosis


do
 over
 time
 evolve
 to
 developing
 a


diagnosis
 schizophrenia.
 just
 bel
 it
 it


suggests
 a
 level
 of
 uncertainty
 that
 is


truly
 schizophrenia
 at
 the
 time
 of
 first


diagnosis.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 simplify
 it


but
 fair
 to
 say
 like
 you
 like
 you


mentioned
 the
 specific
 set
 of
 symptoms


one
 of
 them
 is
 it's
 chronic
 with


schizophrenia
 that
 is
 long
 term
 that's


about
 usually
 six
 months
 or
 more


>> correct


>> okay
 all
 right
 I
 want
 to
 look
 at
 a
 graph


uh
 from
 this
 study
 this
 graph
 shows
 the


incidence
 rate
 ratios
 for
 schizophrenia


spectrum
 disorder
 which
 is
 in
 the
 dark


blue
 color


>> psychosis
 not
 otherwise
 specified
 in


green
 and
 psychotic
 disorders
 which


include
 both
 schizophrenia
 and
 psychosis


in
 black.
 Now,
 for
 each
 cohort
 studied,


this
 is
 comparing
 to
 the
 1975


1979


cohort.
 For
 psychotic
 disorders,
 the


black
 line,
 there
 is
 a
 gradual
 increase


in
 the
 rate
 of
 diagnosis
 starting
 with


those
 born
 in
 the
 198589
 cohort.
 When


researchers
 separated
 the
 data,
 it


showed
 that
 the
 rate
 of
 schizophrenia


goes
 up
 slightly,
 but
 then
 starts
 to
 go


down,
 but
 the
 rate
 of
 psychosis


increases
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 ski
 hill.
 What


is
 this
 telling
 us?


>> Yes.
 So,
 so
 if
 we
 return
 to
 the


difference
 between
 psychosis
 not


otherwise
 specified
 and
 and
 uh
 the


something
 that
 is
 like
 truly
 a


schizophrenia
 spectrum
 disorder.


>> Uh
 it
 is
 the
 the
 the
 market
 increase
 in


in
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 slightly
 uncertain


category.
 the
 psychosis
 not
 otherwise


specified
 which
 means
 that


>> uh
 at
 the
 time
 of
 first
 diagnosis
 there


is
 is
 less
 certainty
 that
 this
 is
 truly


schizophrenia
 which
 means
 that
 there
 are


there's
 complexities
 in
 in
 in


the
 diagnosis
 over
 time
 that
 is


increasing
 the
 most


>> a
 lot
 of
 headlines
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 is


causing
 it
 this
 study
 was
 not
 looking
 at


what
 was
 causing
 this
 uh
 but
 help
 us


understand
 what
 what
 are
 what
 are
 some


links
 that
 have
 been
 sort
 of
 made


>> yeah
 so
 I
 think
 the
 the
 The
 first


important
 point
 is
 that
 this
 study
 was


very
 well
 designed
 to
 characterize


changes
 in
 rates
 over
 time.
 There's


nothing
 about
 this
 particular
 study
 that


helps
 us
 understand
 why
 we're
 observing


what
 we're
 observing.
 So
 when
 I
 think


about
 the
 links,
 it's
 really
 like


extrapolating
 to
 evidence
 beyond
 this


study.
 Um
 but
 I
 would
 say
 uh
 what
 we
 are


observing
 generally
 amongst
 young
 people


and
 these
 are
 16
 to
 35
 year old


individuals
 typically
 uh
 what
 we're


observing
 amongst
 young
 people
 is
 they


are
 far
 less
 stigmatized
 than
 previous


generations
 and
 much
 more
 inclined
 to


seek
 help.
 So
 that
 may
 partly
 explain


why
 we're
 seeing
 more
 and
 younger.
 Um


the
 other
 factor
 is
 that
 uh
 over
 time


there
 has
 been
 more
 robust
 um


implementation
 of
 early
 psychosis


intervention
 programs
 proincially.


>> Okay.


>> So
 anytime
 you
 put
 more
 services
 into
 a


province
 it
 that
 there's
 a
 tendency
 to


pull
 in
 more
 more
 cases.
 And
 then
 the


third
 piece
 that
 that
 actually
 is
 the


cause
 for
 concern
 is
 is
 the
 um
 is
 the


fact
 that
 the
 rise
 in
 the
 less
 certain


diagnosis
 than
 not
 otherwise
 specified


is
 is
 occurring
 dramatically
 at
 a
 time


of
 uh
 cannabis
 legalization.
 And
 and


what
 comes
 with
 cannabis
 legalization
 is


the
 young
 people
 are
 exposed
 with
 high


potency
 uh
 cannabis
 which
 uh
 evidence


outside
 of
 this
 study
 suggests
 does
 pose


a
 serious
 risk
 for
 the
 onset
 of


psychosis.


>> What
 does
 cannabis
 high
 high
 potency
 or


not?
 Uh
 these
 are
 young
 brains
 that


we're
 talking
 about.
 We're
 talking
 um


you
 know
 when
 they're
 still
 developing


up
 until
 about
 the
 age
 of
 25.
 But
 what


what
 does
 it
 do
 to
 the
 brain?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 so
 there's
 lot
 So,
 it's
 not


entirely
 clear,
 but
 that
 does
 seem
 to
 uh


like
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 aggregation
 of


evidence
 that
 suggests
 that
 there's


something
 about
 uh
 the
 THC
 chemical
 in


cannabis
 that
 binds
 with
 certain


receptors
 in
 the
 brain
 that
 causes
 a


biological
 inclination
 to
 become


psychotic.
 So
 the
 way
 I
 think
 about
 it


and
 there
 are
 there
 are
 people
 who
 are


more
 better
 experts
 than
 me
 on
 this
 is
 I


think
 like
 if
 you
 are
 vulnerable
 to


developing
 a
 psychotic
 disorder,


exposure
 to
 high
 potency
 cannabis
 may


increase
 your
 likelihood
 to
 develop
 a


psychotic
 disorder.


>> Okay.
 Um
 is
 there
 a
 difference
 between


uh
 men
 and
 women?


>> There's
 there's
 been
 a
 a
 baseline


difference
 in
 men
 and
 women
 in
 the
 onset


of
 of
 schizophrenia.
 So
 men
 develop
 it


uh
 psychosis
 at
 a
 younger
 age.
 They
 tend


to
 be
 more
 disabled
 as
 a
 result
 of
 the


condition.
 Uh
 the
 ratio
 of
 men
 to
 women


is
 a
 little
 higher
 in
 men.
 And
 of
 course


uh
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 the
 cannabis
 risk


factor
 uh
 and
 actually
 to
 the
 service


utilization.
 Men,
 young
 men
 are


notoriously
 difficult
 to
 engage
 in


healthcare.
 Uh
 and
 they
 are
 much
 more


likely
 to
 consume
 substances
 than
 women.


uh
 we
 talked
 about
 legalization
 of


course
 2018
 um
 looking
 at
 this
 data
 and


of
 course
 this
 is
 just
 just
 the


beginning
 here
 was
 that
 the
 right
 call


>> yeah
 so
 so
 uh
 it's
 it's
 an
 important


question
 um
 the


policy
 is
 inherently
 a
 compromise
 and
 I


think
 that
 the
 the
 legalization
 issue
 in


2018
 responded
 to
 a
 couple
 of
 important


issues
 one
 is
 that
 that
 I
 mean,
 if
 you


walk
 around
 Toronto,
 there's
 clearly
 a
 a


public
 interest
 in
 having
 ready
 access


to
 marijuana
 recreationally.
 I
 mean,


that
 that
 is
 just
 what
 what
 people
 want


and
 so
 policy
 follows
 what
 what
 people


want
 typically.
 I
 also
 think,
 and
 this


is
 a
 really
 important
 piece,
 is
 that
 um


when
 cannabis
 was
 illegal,
 uh
 the
 the


consequences
 of
 it
 being
 illegal,


incarceration
 for
 possession
 did
 not


happen
 equitably.
 and
 that
 we
 know
 we


knew
 and
 that
 more
 marginalized


individuals
 were
 more
 likely
 to
 be


incarcerated
 and
 have
 all
 the
 negative


consequences
 of
 having
 a
 criminal
 record


etc.


>> uh
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that.
 So,
 so
 that
 was


a
 very
 good
 legitimate
 reason
 to
 enact


the
 policy.
 But
 now
 as
 more
 evidence


emerges
 like
 this
 is
 what
 we
 want
 to
 be


able
 to
 do,
 right?
 Monitor
 unintended


consequences
 of
 policy.
 So
 now
 what
 do


we
 do?
 and
 and and
 to
 me
 like
 uh


tobacco
 is
 probably
 a
 better
 example


than
 alcohol.


>> Tobacco
 is
 a
 legal
 substance,
 but
 it's


pretty
 highly
 regulated
 and
 highly


taxed.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 there
 are


policy
 solutions
 to
 to
 find
 that


compromise
 or
 balance
 between,


you
 know,
 maintaining
 the
 benefits
 for


which
 the
 policy
 was
 first
 enacted
 at


the
 same
 time
 address
 some
 of
 the
 risks


that
 we're
 learning
 about.


>> All right.
 receiving
 this
 kind
 of


diagnosis
 uh
 can
 be
 frightening
 for


many.
 Um
 could
 you
 explain
 how
 this


diagnosis
 is
 challenging
 for
 the
 indivi


individual
 or
 for
 those
 who
 are
 in
 their


lives
 as
 well?


>> Oh,
 this
 is
 you
 know
 my
 my
 clinical
 work


is
 in
 the
 CAMH
 emergency
 department
 and


this
 is
 this
 is
 one
 of
 those
 ones
 where


you
 uh
 you
 really
 feel
 for
 the


individual.
 Uh
 so
 how
 it
 manifests
 um
 it


typically
 it
 is
 a
 it
 often
 a
 slowly


evolving
 sort
 of
 uh
 deviation
 from


reality
 and
 also
 often
 uh
 a
 slowly


evolving
 uh
 social
 withdrawal
 that
 that


uh
 so
 a
 young
 man
 uh
 in
 high
 school
 like


totally
 social
 engaged
 in
 everything


starts
 to
 withdraw
 from
 stuff
 then


starts
 like
 like
 avoiding
 school,


reluctant
 to
 avoid
 school,
 family
 starts


noticing
 that
 that
 he
 might
 be
 sort
 of


talking
 to
 himself,
 laughing


inappropriately
 at
 times.
 Um,
 so
 that's


kind
 of
 how
 it
 it
 it
 manifests.
 Um,
 and


and
 it's
 incredibly
 important
 that


individuals
 uh
 have
 access
 to
 care
 early


because
 we
 know
 that
 the
 longer
 an


individual
 goes
 untreated,
 the
 worse
 the


prognosis
 uh
 is.
 like
 like
 if
 we
 can
 get


people
 into
 care
 early
 the
 we
 can
 really


change
 the
 trajectory
 of
 a
 young


person's
 life.


>> I
 think
 I
 know
 the
 answer
 to
 this
 but


are
 there
 enough
 supports
 uh
 in
 place


for
 those
 seeking
 treatment?


>> So
 uh
 I
 would
 say
 that
 um
 throughout
 our


province
 we
 know
 that
 we
 don't
 have


enough
 services
 uh
 for
 individuals


struggling
 with
 mental
 illnesses


generally.
 In
 this
 case,
 we
 do
 have
 a
 in


comparison
 to
 other
 areas
 of
 our
 mental


health
 system,
 we
 do
 have
 a
 robust


system
 of
 early
 psychosis
 intervention


programs
 that
 currently
 exist.
 Um,
 but


evidence
 that
 has
 come
 out
 of
 uh
 my


research
 team
 suggests
 that
 even
 though


this
 provincial
 network
 exists,
 um
 not


not
 everybody
 with
 the
 disorder
 can
 can


can
 or
 does
 access
 them.
 And
 and
 some
 of


that
 has
 to
 do
 with
 inadequacy
 of


resources.
 Some
 of
 it
 has
 to
 do
 with


awareness.
 And
 so,
 for
 example,
 if


you're
 diagnosed
 by
 a
 psychiatrist
 or


diagnosed
 in
 a
 hospital
 setting,
 you're


much
 more
 likely
 to
 be
 referred
 to
 one


of
 these
 programs,
 excuse
 me,
 than
 if


you
 were
 managed
 in
 primary
 care.
 And


that's
 probably
 just
 an
 awareness


situation.
 Um
 and
 and
 the
 the
 that's
 a


big
 problem
 because


uh
 what
 we
 know
 about
 the
 consequences


in
 addition
 to
 like
 you
 know
 longer


periods
 of
 no
 treatment
 uh
 this
 is
 a


deadly
 illness
 that
 that
 um
 you
 know


people
 who
 are
 diagnosed
 in
 a
 hospital


these
 are
 16
 to
 35
 year olds
 uh
 one
 in


25
 die
 within
 5
 years.
 If
 you're


diagnosed
 in
 outpatient
 setting
 one
 in


40
 nobody
 should
 be
 dying
 between
 the


ages
 of
 16
 and
 35.
 And


>> how
 do
 they
 how
 do
 they
 die?
 The
 most


common
 cause
 is
 suicide.


>> Okay.


>> Yeah.
 The
 suicide
 rate
 is
 is
 incredibly


high
 and
 and
 it
 just
 makes
 sense
 because


these
 are
 young
 people
 who
 have
 a
 sense


of
 who
 they
 are
 and
 what
 they're
 going


to
 be
 doing
 in
 their
 life
 and
 their


whole
 identity
 gets
 rocked
 by
 this


diagnosis.


>> All
 right.
 Uh
 doctor,
 we're
 going
 to


have
 to
 leave
 it
 there,
 but
 really


appreciate
 your
 insights.
 Uh
 thank
 you


for
 this
 and
 of
 course
 um
 with
 this


there
 will
 be
 more
 things
 to
 come
 out
 of


this
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 research
 and
 studies


and
 policy.
 So,
 we
 look
 forward
 to
 that


and
 uh
 thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> Thanks
 very
 much
 for
 having
 me.

 Now,

 lifelong

 in

everything
 in

 into
 a
 new
 book


called
 The

 Why
 We


Dream,
 and
 What
 It
 Means
 for
 Our
 Health.


Karen
 Vancampen
 is
 a
 health
 and
 science


journalist.
 How
 are
 you
 doing
 Karen?


>> I'm
 well.
 How
 are
 you?


>> I
 am
 doing
 well.
 Let's
 talk.
 Dreams
 are


quite
 complex.
 There's
 emotions.
 There's


visual
 components
 to
 help
 us
 understand


what
 parts
 of
 the
 brain
 are
 affiliated


with
 dreaming.


>> So,
 different
 parts
 of
 the
 brain
 are


active
 at
 different
 times
 in
 the
 sleep


cycle.
 Um,
 one
 part
 of
 the
 brain
 that's


active
 during
 dreaming
 is
 the
 emotional


center
 of
 your
 brain.
 So,
 um
 the
 parts


of
 the
 brain
 that
 help
 process
 emotions


that
 um
 are
 involved
 in
 our
 feelings,
 uh


the
 preffrontal
 cortex,
 uh
 during
 REM


sleep,
 it's
 less
 active
 than
 when
 we're


awake.
 And
 that's
 the
 part
 of
 the
 brain


that
 really
 deals
 with
 making
 decisions,


thinking
 rationally,
 and
 that's
 less


active
 during
 REM.


>> All right.
 You
 mentioned
 REM
 and
 you


mentioned
 cycle.
 So,
 REM
 to
 simplify


rapid
 eye
 movement,
 and
 then
 there
 is


non-rapid
 eye
 movement.
 Um
 you
 mentioned


which
 cycles
 we
 dream
 in.
 How
 do
 we
 know


what
 you
 know
 there
 there's
 eye
 movement


that's
 very
 clear
 in
 when
 we
 talk
 about


but
 how
 do
 we
 know
 that's
 where
 we


dream?


>> So
 we
 dream
 um
 through
 nonrem
 and
 REM.


So
 nonREM
 sleep
 is
 stages
 one
 through


three.
 Stages
 1,
 two,
 and
 three
 is


nonrem
 sleep.
 And
 REM
 sleep
 is
 stage


four.
 So
 we
 actually
 dream
 all
 through


the
 sleep
 cycle
 all
 through
 the
 night.


Um
 so
 that's


>> where
 are
 the
 best
 most
 vivid
 dreams?


>> REM
 sleep.
 So,
 it's
 typically
 our
 most


intense,
 vivid,
 emotional
 dreams
 happen


during
 REM
 and
 we
 get
 to
 our
 first
 REM.


We
 go
 through
 four
 or
 five
 stages
 of
 the


sleep
 cycle
 a
 night,
 right?


>> And
 um
 so
 we
 get
 it's
 about
 90
 minutes


into
 the
 sleep
 cycle
 that
 we
 have
 our


first
 period
 of
 REM.


>> Okay.
 Uh
 reading
 your
 book,
 you
 have
 I


would
 say
 quite
 an
 unusual
 childhood
 in


terms
 of
 what
 you
 were
 what
 you


experienced.
 what
 drew
 you
 to
 understand


more
 about
 sleep
 and
 dreams
 and
 I
 know


your
 father
 had
 a
 lot
 to
 do
 with
 that.


So
 my
 dad's
 a
 sleep
 doctor,
 so
 I
 was


always
 immersed
 in
 this
 world
 of
 sleep.


And
 I
 sort
 of
 look
 at
 it
 as
 sleep
 was


kind
 of
 like
 this
 gateway
 to
 the
 world


of
 dreams.


>> And
 so
 I
 was
 always,
 you
 know,
 always


thinking
 about
 sleep
 and
 trying
 to
 get


enough
 sleep.
 And
 sleep
 was
 a
 really
 big


part
 of
 growing
 up
 um
 my
 childhood.
 And


then
 a
 few
 years
 ago,
 I
 read
 this
 uh


scientific
 study
 that
 said
 we're
 as


dreamd
 as
 we
 are
 sleepd
 deprived.
 And


it's
 it
 made
 me
 think,
 you
 know,
 why
 do


dreams
 matter
 on
 their
 own
 in,
 you
 know,


not
 just
 sleep?
 Sleep
 is
 its
 own


industry
 and
 we're
 very
 focused
 on


sleep,
 but
 what
 about
 dreams?
 And
 then


it
 got
 me
 it
 turned
 me
 on
 to
 uh
 the


science
 of
 dreaming


>> as
 you
 mentioned
 and
 what
 we've
 talked


about
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 brain.
 We
 have


come
 a
 long
 way
 in
 terms
 of


understanding
 the
 brain.
 Yes.


>> Uh
 do
 we
 better
 understand
 dreams?
 I


know
 this
 is
 a
 question
 of
 why
 do
 we


dream
 has
 been
 asked
 for
 decades.
 uh
 but


do
 we
 have
 a
 better
 understanding
 of


that?


>> So
 there's
 many
 possibilities
 of
 why
 we


dream.
 So
 one
 idea
 is
 that
 we
 dream
 to


help
 uh
 dream
 sleep
 and
 dreams
 help


consolidate
 memories.
 Okay.


>> So
 let's
 say
 we've
 learned
 something
 uh


new
 during
 the
 day
 or
 we've
 had
 a
 new


experience.
 It's
 thought
 that
 uh
 during


sleep
 and
 during
 dreams
 it
 helps
 to


strengthen
 these
 memories.
 So
 that's
 one


thing
 is
 memory
 consolidation.
 Um,


>> so
 a
 cabinet
 of
 of
 dreams
 that
 you
 can


put
 in
 and


>> Exactly.
 So,
 and
 then
 uh
 it's
 really


neat.
 Um,
 so
 one
 idea
 is
 it's
 called


this
 ne
 it's
 called
 the
 next
 up
 model
 of


dreaming.
 Okay.


>> And
 I
 found
 this
 fascinating
 because


I've
 always
 wondered,
 you
 know,
 why
 do
 I


suddenly
 dream
 of
 something
 from
 my


childhood
 or
 years
 ago?
 Why
 do
 I
 do
 I


choose
 to
 say
 dream
 of
 it
 tonight?
 What


what
 is
 it?
 And
 this
 idea
 is
 that
 in


order
 to
 strengthen
 memories,
 say
 recent


experiences,
 recent
 memories,
 you


associate
 it
 with
 with
 memories
 from


your
 catalog
 of
 memories
 that
 are


already
 stored
 in
 your
 brain.
 So
 that's


it's
 finding
 possibilities
 through
 these


connections,
 these
 unique
 and
 um
 yeah,


unique
 connections
 through
 these


associations.


>> Uh
 another
 theory
 is
 sort
 of
 viewing


dreams
 as
 sort
 of
 a
 night
 therapy.


>> Walk
 me
 through
 that.
 That's


interesting.


>> It's
 so
 interesting.
 So
 um
 Yep.
 So


Matthew
 Walker
 he
 uh
 so
 it's
 dreams
 as


overnight
 therapy
 and
 the
 whole
 idea
 um


about
 dreams
 as
 overnight
 therapy
 and


other
 uh
 dream
 researchers
 have
 have


also
 studied
 this
 is
 that
 it
 helps
 to


process
 our
 emotions.
 So
 um
 it
 helps


come
 to
 terms
 with
 say
 difficult


emotions.
 Um
 Roslin
 Cartwright,
 she
 was


known
 as
 the
 queen
 of
 dreams
 and
 she
 did


these
 studies
 on
 people
 who
 were
 going


through
 divorce
 and
 she
 found
 out
 if
 you


dream
 you
 have
 these
 unsettling
 dreams


about
 your
 divorce
 you
 actually
 they
 the


subjects
 tended
 to
 cope
 better
 a
 year


later.


>> So
 that
 is
 also
 so
 it's
 it
 helps
 to
 um


process
 the
 emotions
 but
 keep
 the


details
 of
 the
 memory.
 There's
 also
 this


thinking
 of
 our
 dreams.
 Some
 people
 may


look
 look
 at
 them
 as
 two
 separate


compartments
 when
 we're
 awake
 and
 we're


falling
 asleep.
 But
 when
 we
 wake
 up


sometimes
 we
 might
 have
 solved
 some
 of


the
 issues
 that
 we
 dealt
 with.
 Help
 us


understand
 perhaps
 how
 dreams
 kind
 of


help
 us
 when
 we
 wake
 up
 in
 our
 real


world.


>> So
 it's
 thought
 that
 when
 we're
 falling


asleep,
 we
 sort
 of
 tag
 certain
 ideas
 to


revisit
 later
 in
 the
 night.
 So
 let's
 say


you're
 you're
 trying
 to,
 you
 know,


you're
 noodling
 around.
 When
 you're


thinking
 about
 a
 problem
 you're
 trying


to
 solve,
 you
 might
 be
 thinking
 about
 it


as
 you're
 falling
 asleep.
 So
 during


sleep
 onset,
 it's
 this
 really
 unique


time.
 It's
 almost
 like
 a
 dreamy


brainstorming
 session.


>> I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 it's
 like
 a
 to-do


list
 for
 it's
 another
 to-do
 list.
 All


right.


>> Exactly.
 So
 you
 can
 like
 if
 you
 you
 can


even
 guide
 your
 dream
 thoughts.
 That's


about
 dream
 engineering.


>> Okay.


>> And
 so
 let's
 say
 you
 want
 to
 work
 on
 a


problem,
 you
 want
 to
 solve
 a
 problem
 or


you
 want
 to
 think
 about
 a
 new
 creative


idea.
 when
 you're
 falling
 asleep,
 you


can
 think
 about
 this
 idea,
 think
 about


this
 problem
 that
 you
 want
 to
 work
 on


and
 then
 often
 times
 it
 will
 help
 guide


your
 dreams.
 So
 those
 thoughts
 that


you're
 thinking
 about
 and
 dream


engineering
 um
 uses
 technology
 to
 um


help
 you
 guide
 and
 shape
 your
 dreams.
 So


I
 did
 this
 dream
 experiment
 and
 it
 was


really
 fun.
 And
 so
 basically
 I
 um
 Adam


Har
 he's
 a
 dream
 researcher
 and
 he


helped
 me
 set
 it
 up
 this
 sort
 of
 ad
 hoc


dream
 experiment
 at
 home


>> and
 so
 as
 I
 was
 just
 falling
 asleep
 in


sleep
 onset
 the
 first
 few
 minutes
 of


sleep


>> um
 a
 recording
 I
 did
 a
 recording
 before


and
 then
 it
 would
 the
 recording
 played


and
 it
 said
 it
 was
 my
 voice
 and
 it
 said


remember
 to
 think
 of
 a
 tree.


>> Ah


>> and
 then
 so
 then
 that
 was
 help
 guide
 my


my
 dreams.


>> And
 what
 did
 you
 dream
 then?
 I
 dreamt


about
 all
 these
 different
 trees.
 First


it
 was
 very
 concrete.


>> Okay.


>> And
 I
 was
 dreaming
 of
 there
 was
 this


willow
 tree
 um
 in
 front
 of
 this
 cabin


where
 um
 our
 family
 used
 to
 have
 this


cabin.
 And
 then
 it
 started
 to
 get


>> the
 farther
 I
 went
 into
 sleep
 onset,
 it


started
 getting
 more
 creative
 and
 um
 not


as
 concrete
 and
 not
 as
 logical.


>> Okay.
 And
 then
 I
 thought
 of
 uh
 this
 time


that
 my
 husband
 and
 I
 got
 lost
 in
 these


woods


>> and
 then
 the
 the
 trees
 became
 waves
 and


so
 it
 got
 very
 abstract
 almost.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 speaking
 of
 abstract,
 let's


talk
 about
 lucid
 dreams
 there.
 I'm
 sure


there
 are
 many
 listeners
 who
 have


probably
 had
 a
 dream
 where
 they're


running
 and
 then
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 they're


like,
 "Hold
 on,


>> I
 am
 dreaming.
 I
 know
 I'm
 dreaming
 and


probably
 stop."
 Um


explain
 to
 us
 about
 lucid
 dreams.
 What


can
 you
 tell
 us
 about
 them?
 Why
 do
 we


have
 control?


>> So
 lucid
 dreaming
 is
 when
 it
 starts
 with


to
 be
 aware
 that
 you're
 in
 a
 dream
 as


the
 dream
 is
 happening.
 So
 it's
 to
 have


that
 awareness
 and
 then
 once
 you
 gain


the
 awareness,
 it's
 to
 develop
 that


skill
 to
 actually
 learn
 that
 you
 your


dream
 is
 a
 it's
 a
 creation
 of
 your


imagination.
 So
 you
 actually
 can
 be
 in


control.
 So
 then
 you
 start
 to
 control


your
 dream
 characters
 or
 maybe
 the
 plot.


You
 could
 choose,
 you
 know,
 what
 to
 do,


what
 you've
 always
 wanted
 to
 do.
 Some


people
 want
 to
 try
 and
 fly.
 Um
 I
 read


about
 I
 talked
 to
 a
 dream
 researcher
 and


he
 told
 me
 there's
 an
 artist
 and
 he


imagines
 um
 an
 art
 gallery.


>> Okay.


>> And
 he
 opens
 the
 door
 and
 goes
 into
 this


art
 gallery
 and
 there's
 all
 these


beautiful
 paintings
 and
 they're
 a


creation
 of
 his
 own
 his
 own
 imagination


and
 mind.
 Okay.


>> So
 then
 he
 wakes
 up
 and
 and
 sketches
 out


what
 he
 was
 dreaming.


>> All right.
 I
 I'm
 going
 to
 I
 feel
 like


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 power
 to


harness
 here
 if
 we
 can
 really
 sort
 of


figure
 it
 out.
 On
 the
 flip
 side,
 there's


something
 that
 you
 talk
 about
 in
 your


book
 called
 dream
 advertising.


>> Yes.


>> Help
 us
 understand
 what
 that
 is.
 So
 it


was
 brought
 up
 a
 few
 years
 ago
 and
 so


basically
 we
 are
 more
 there
 we
 are


vulnerable
 when
 we're
 sleeping
 and
 so


the
 question
 was
 brought
 up
 let's
 say
 if


we
 have
 um
 a
 speaker
 in
 our
 in
 our


bedroom
 and
 it
 could
 you
 know
 if
 we're


susceptible
 to
 ideas
 and
 thoughts
 could


it
 then
 could
 we
 be
 um
 influenced
 say
 if


a
 company
 wanted
 to
 um
 you
 know
 say
 push


their
 product
 while
 we
 were
 sleeping.


>> Yeah.
 So
 that's
 kind
 of
 what
 it
 is.
 So,


you
 know,
 the
 is
 it
 is
 it
 probable?
 Is


it
 possible?
 These
 are
 sort
 of,
 you


know,
 things
 where
 technically
 if
 we're


susceptible
 to
 suggestion
 at
 certain


times
 of
 the
 sleep
 sleep
 cycle,


>> but
 is
 it
 really
 probable
 that
 this
 will


change
 our
 say
 buying
 and
 consumer


habits?


>> What
 does
 that
 uh
 tell
 us
 about
 the


power
 of
 dreams
 in
 our
 lives?


>> I
 think
 that
 dreams
 are
 so
 powerful.
 I


mean
 it's
 it
 makes
 me
 think
 you
 know
 we


spend
 a
 third
 of
 our
 lives
 asleep
 and
 a


large
 portion
 of
 that
 time
 dreaming
 and


there's
 this
 whole
 this
 mental
 life
 that


we
 have
 there
 that
 we
 can
 tap
 into
 to


try
 and
 you
 know
 guide
 our
 dreams
 for


creativity
 to
 solve
 problems
 and
 then
 in


the
 morning
 use
 our
 dreams
 to
 better


understand
 say
 our
 preoccupations
 or
 our


concerns
 what's
 sort
 of
 weighing
 on
 our


minds.
 During
 the
 production
 of
 this


book,
 uh
 you
 have
 delved
 into
 a
 number


of
 studies.
 I
 am
 curious
 what's
 one
 that


kind
 of
 left
 you
 sitting
 back
 and
 being


like
 that
 is
 like
 amazing
 to
 think
 how


our
 brain
 works
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 dreams.


>> So
 the
 the
 work
 that
 I
 was
 so
 so


dreaming
 for
 sure
 that
 I
 talked
 about


and
 then
 also
 anesthesia
 dreams.
 So,


it's
 a
 group
 of
 researchers
 at
 Stanford


and
 they've
 discovered
 that
 if
 you
 keep


a
 patient
 at
 a
 certain
 brain
 state
 just


under
 the
 level
 of
 consciousness,
 they


come
 to
 this
 calm,
 relaxed
 state.
 And


it's
 wonderful
 because
 you
 can
 revisit


potentially
 difficult
 and
 even
 traumatic


experiences
 and
 events,
 but
 having
 this


calm
 state.
 So,
 you're
 able
 to
 revisit


them
 and
 then
 almost
 create
 new
 memories


of
 them.
 And
 so,
 I
 spoke
 with
 people
 who


had
 these
 experiences
 as
 well
 and
 they


said
 they
 were
 lifealtering,


transforming.
 So,
 um
 it's
 it's


unbelievable
 actually.


>> The
 potential
 is
 the
 potential.
 Yeah,


>> there's
 so
 much
 there.
 Um,
 I
 can't


imagine
 what's
 what
 your
 bedside
 table


looks
 like,
 but
 I
 imagine
 there's


probably
 a
 book
 and
 a
 pen
 there.
 Yes.


Um,
 I
 will
 admit
 before
 this
 interview


this
 weekend,
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 remember


my
 dreams,
 right?
 Uh,
 because
 lots
 of


people
 when
 they
 share
 dreams,
 they
 want


some
 interpretation
 of
 the
 symbols.
 Um,


what
 do
 you
 how
 do
 we
 take
 full


advantage
 of
 our
 dreams?


>> So,
 I
 always
 think
 we're
 the
 best


interpreter
 of
 our
 own
 dreams.
 So
 we


it's
 how
 we
 want
 to
 tap
 into
 them,
 delve


into
 them,
 look
 at
 them
 differently.
 Um,


you
 know,
 we
 know
 if
 let's
 say
 there's
 a


certain
 theme
 or
 even
 a
 person
 keeps


showing
 up.
 The
 way
 I
 look
 at
 it
 is
 it's


like
 our
 dreams
 are
 saying,
 you
 know,


pay
 more
 attention
 to
 this
 idea
 or
 maybe


this
 person.
 That's
 something
 um
 that


you
 can
 do.
 I
 did
 um
 a
 dream
 salon.


>> I
 did
 read
 about
 this.
 Yes.
 Okay.


>> So
 it
 was
 so
 interesting.
 I've
 never


shared
 a
 dream
 before
 and
 so
 it
 was
 with


a
 group
 of
 friends
 and
 dream
 researchers


>> and
 um
 it
 was
 so
 interesting
 because
 I


shared
 a
 dream
 and
 the
 perspectives
 that


other
 people
 had
 on
 so
 you
 you
 share


your
 dream
 and
 then
 different
 people
 say


you
 know
 if
 it
 was
 my
 dream
 I
 would


maybe
 think
 about
 this
 and
 it
 totally


changed
 my
 perspective
 on
 my
 dreams
 and


then
 you
 know
 you
 can
 you
 can
 look
 at
 it


from
 other
 people's
 perspectives
 and
 and


see
 what
 works
 for
 you


>> very
 fascinating
 exciting
 stuff.
 This
 is


a
 really
 exciting
 read.
 Lots
 of


potential
 as
 as
 we
 talked
 about.
 Karen,


thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 this.
 Really


appreciate
 it.


>> Thank
 you.
 It
 was
 great
 chatting.


>> I'm
 Jan.
