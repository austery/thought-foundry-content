By
 the
 end
 of
 this
 video,
 you
 will


understand
 exactly
 why
 the
 US
 wants


Greenland,
 how
 it
 connects
 to
 AI,
 China,


and
 Silicon
 Valley.
 Stick
 around.
 But


before
 we
 start,
 this
 episode
 is
 brought


to
 you
 by
 Href's
 marketing
 platform,
 and


their
 feature
 called
 Brand
 Raider,
 which


helps
 businesses
 grow
 in
 the
 AI
 era.
 You


know
 how
 businesses
 are
 obsessed
 with


Google
 rankings
 and
 SEO,
 but
 have
 you


actually
 checked
 if
 your
 business
 is


showing
 up
 in
 Chad
 GBT
 or
 Perplexity
 or


Gemini?
 Is
 it
 being
 mentioned
 in
 YouTube


summaries
 or
 Reddit
 threads?
 And
 if
 it


doesn't
 or
 you're
 not
 sure
 how
 it
 shows


up
 in
 the
 AI
 search,
 it's
 a
 problem


because
 the
 search
 behavior
 has
 changed


forever.
 People
 use
 AI
 to
 research


everything
 these
 days,
 whether
 they
 want


to
 work
 with
 you,
 who
 to
 buy
 from,
 what


to
 invest
 in,
 and
 if
 you're
 not
 in
 those


results,
 you're
 invisible.
 Brand
 Raider


shows
 you
 exactly
 how
 your
 brand
 appears


across
 AI
 search
 engines,
 what
 people


are
 seeing
 when
 they
 ask
 about
 you,
 what


percentage
 of
 AI
 chats
 mention
 your


brand,
 find
 out
 what
 AI
 says
 about
 your


brand,
 and
 this
 is
 the
 key
 part,
 what


you
 need
 to
 fix
 to
 actually
 show
 up.
 You


can
 spot
 AI
 visibility
 gaps,
 see
 what


content
 is
 being
 picked
 up
 by
 AI,
 track


AI
 answers,
 and
 position
 your
 brand


around
 prompts
 instead
 of
 keywords.

 All right,
 let's
 get
 back
 into


the
 video.
 It's
 1946.


World
 War
 II
 just
 ended.
 President


Truman
 receives
 a
 classified
 memo
 from


his
 Secretary
 of
 State
 with
 the
 subject


line,
 Greenland.


The
 memo
 is
 blunt.
 We
 need
 to
 buy
 it


from
 Denmark.
 For
 hund00
 million,
 all


cash.
 The
 Cold
 War
 is
 starting.
 The


Arctic
 is
 the
 shortest
 route
 between
 the


US
 and
 Soviet
 missiles.
 And
 Greenland


sits
 directly
 in
 the
 flight
 path.


Whoever
 controls
 Greenland
 controls
 one


of
 the
 most
 critical
 pieces
 of
 the


warning
 system
 for
 nuclear
 war.
 Denmark


says
 no.
 Fast
 forward
 80
 years.


President
 Trump.
 Same
 island,
 same


interest.
 Except
 this
 time,
 it's
 not
 so


much
 about
 the
 missiles.
 It's
 about


this,
 the
 magnets.
 The
 magnets
 that
 cool


AI
 data
 centers.
 Because
 somewhere


between
 Truman's
 cold
 war
 and
 today's
 AI


boom,
 the
 US
 outsourced
 the
 entire


supply
 chain
 for
 the
 thing
 that
 keeps


these
 machines
 running.
 And
 now
 China


controls
 it,
 almost
 all
 of
 it.
 The
 only


problem
 is
 that
 even
 if
 the
 US
 took


Greenland
 tomorrow,
 it
 most
 likely
 would


not
 fix
 the
 China
 problem
 at
 all.
 Today


is
 about
 Greenland
 in
 the
 context
 of


tech
 and
 AI,
 rare
 earths,
 and
 the
 next


US
 China
 tech
 warfront.


Let's
 dive
 in.


What
 happens
 when
 you
 generate
 an
 AI


image
 or
 ask
 Gemini
 a
 question?
 Your


words
 are
 turned
 into
 vectors.
 that
 are


fed
 into
 a
 giant
 probability
 machine.


But
 what
 else?
 You're
 activating
 a


pretty
 complex
 supply
 chain.
 And
 this


supply
 chain
 involves
 rare
 earth


permanent
 magnets.
 A
 single
 chip
 uses


about.3
 W
 hours.
 A
 typical
 Google
 search


is
 roughly
 a
 thousand
 times
 less.
 All
 of


that
 extra
 energy
 turns
 into
 heat
 inside


a
 data
 center.
 And
 this
 heat
 doesn't


dissipate
 on
 its
 own.
 Every
 watt
 of


compute
 generates
 heat
 that
 must
 be


actively
 removed
 and
 that
 removal


depends
 on
 the
 cooling
 systems.
 The


cooling
 systems
 are
 packed
 with


neodymium
 iron
 boron
 magnets.
 And
 this


is
 what
 they
 look
 like.
 The
 magnets
 are


used
 in
 cooling
 fans
 and
 high
 density


racks
 for
 rapid
 thermal
 response
 for


basically
 cooling.
 And
 the
 problem
 is


that
 these
 very
 magnets
 that
 cool
 down


data
 centers
 are
 manufactured
 almost


entirely


in
 China
 and
 they're
 sitting
 under


Chinese
 expert
 controls
 that
 tightened


pretty
 drastically
 just
 last
 year
 in


December.
 Modern
 AI
 depends
 on
 models,


chips,
 and
 data
 centers.
 For
 a
 data


center
 to
 function
 when
 it's
 got
 power


dense
 GPUs,
 it
 needs
 a
 massive
 cooling


and
 power
 stack.
 rare
 earths
 are
 inside


that
 stack
 at
 multiple
 layers
 from


cooling
 fans
 to
 pumps
 to
 storage
 to


transformers
 to
 generators.
 So
 when
 you


hear
 new
 AI
 data
 center
 project
 in


Texas,
 you
 also
 have
 to
 understand
 that


that
 means
 that
 the
 demand
 for
 the


magnets
 is
 scaling
 as
 well.
 So
 what
 does


Greenland
 have
 to
 do
 with
 these
 magnets,


cooling
 systems,
 and
 AI?
 Well,
 just


about
 everything.


It
 is
 important
 to
 understand
 the


historical
 context
 here.
 In
 1985,
 the


United
 States
 controlled
 approximately


60%
 of
 global
 rare
 earth
 production
 and


most
 of
 it
 came
 from
 Mountain
 Pass
 mine


in
 California's
 Mojave
 Desert.
 China,
 on


the
 other
 hand,
 produced
 about
 30%.
 The


United
 States
 was
 the
 world
 leader
 in


rare
 earth
 mining,
 processing,
 and


magnet
 manufacturing.
 They
 dominated
 the


entire
 vertical
 from
 ore
 to
 finished


product.
 But
 then
 the
 tables
 have


turned.
 Throughout
 the
 '9s
 and
 2000s,


China
 poured
 a
 lot
 of
 state
 money
 into


dirty
 rare
 earth
 processing
 as
 well
 as


the
 magnet
 plants
 that
 western
 companies


were
 happy
 to
 shut
 down
 and
 offshore
 to


China.
 So
 by
 the
 time
 anyone
 noticed,


nearly
 the
 entire
 supply
 chain
 had


migrated
 to
 China.
 Starting
 2006,
 for


nine
 years
 in
 a
 row,
 China
 weaponized


its
 control,
 they
 restricted
 exports
 and


cut
 supply
 by
 40%
 in
 2010.
 And
 then


during
 a
 maritime
 dispute
 with
 Japan


over
 a
 detained
 fishing
 boat
 captain,


they
 halted
 rare
 earth
 shipments
 to


Japan
 entirely
 for
 2
 months.
 Japanese


manufacturer
 panicked
 because
 Japan
 was


90%
 dependent
 on
 Chinese
 imports
 at
 the


time.
 The
 Japan
 embargo
 was
 a
 watershed


moment
 because
 for
 the
 first
 time
 the


world
 saw
 China
 willing
 to
 use
 rare


earth
 supply
 as
 a
 geopolitical
 weapon.


In
 turn,
 Japan
 aggressively
 diversified


and
 reduced
 Chinese
 dependence
 from
 90%


to
 60%.
 And
 cut
 total
 rare
 earth


consumption
 in
 half.
 The
 2010
 China


Japan
 embargo
 was
 a
 wakeup
 call
 for


everyone.
 And
 in
 2014,
 the
 World
 Trade


Organization
 ruled
 that
 China's
 export


quotas
 violated
 trade
 rules
 because


China
 couldn't
 justify
 them
 as


conservation
 or
 environmental


protection.
 China
 had
 to
 abolish
 formal


quotas,
 but
 they
 retained
 export


licensing
 and
 fully
 controlled


processing
 of
 rare
 earths.
 And
 8
 years


later,
 as
 you
 know,
 the
 magnet


dependency
 collided
 with
 the
 AI
 boom.


2022
 OpenAI
 launches
 Chad
 GBT
 that


became
 as
 you
 all
 know
 the
 fastest


growing
 consumer
 technology
 in
 history


and
 that
 triggered
 the
 current
 AI


infrastructure
 buildout.
 The
 AI
 boom


created
 demand
 for
 data
 center
 capacity


that
 we
 have
 never
 seen
 before
 and
 that


is
 how
 the
 rare
 earths
 re-entered
 the


chat
 because
 AI
 workloads
 generate


vastly
 more
 heat
 than
 traditional


computing.
 Server
 racks
 jumped
 from
 10


kows
 to
 50
 kowatts,
 some
 exceeding
 100


kow,
 where
 every
 watt
 of
 compute


requires
 cooling.
 And
 modern
 cooling


systems,
 high
 efficiency
 fans,
 liquid


circulation
 pumps
 rely
 on
 neodymium
 iron


boron
 magnets.
 And
 they
 do
 so
 for
 their


size
 and
 energy
 efficiency.
 Meaning
 that


on
 top
 of
 the
 existing
 demand,
 we're


looking
 for
 a
 ton
 more
 magnets,
 which


means
 a
 ton
 more
 dependency
 on
 China.


And
 once
 again,
 I
 will
 remind
 you
 that


90%
 of
 these
 magnets
 are
 produced
 and


processed
 in
 China.
 And
 if
 you're
 the
 US


and
 you
 are
 in
 direct
 confrontation
 with


China,
 you're
 going
 to
 want
 to
 deal
 with


this
 sooner
 rather
 than
 later.
 In
 the


context
 of
 AI
 and
 tech,
 the
 US
 needs


Greenland
 because
 the
 rare
 earth


dominance
 matters
 for
 the
 US.
 And
 it


matters
 because
 the
 current
 situation


gives
 China
 leverage
 over
 the
 physical


hardware
 that
 AI
 runs
 on.
 You
 may
 ask


why
 Greenland?
 Greenland
 holds
 1.5


million
 metric
 tons
 of
 rare
 earth


reserves
 which
 is
 enough
 to
 supply


meaningful
 share
 of
 the
 US
 demand
 and


reduce
 dependence
 on
 China.
 But


Greenland
 alone
 can't
 fix
 this
 problem


because
 the
 problem
 isn't
 in
 the
 mining.


The
 common
 narrative
 frames
 rare
 earths


as
 the
 mining
 problem,
 but
 it's
 not.


China
 produces
 most
 of
 global
 rare
 earth


ore,
 but
 that's
 the
 least
 important
 part


of
 the
 equation.
 They
 own
 around
 70%
 of


global
 mining
 and
 they
 process
 around


90.
 Processing
 being
 the
 operative
 word.


There
 are
 several
 reasons
 why
 Greenland


cannot
 fix
 this
 problem.
 Reason
 number


one,
 the
 processing
 mode
 is
 not
 solvable


by
 land.
 Think
 of
 it
 this
 way.
 the
 US
 or


Europe
 can
 design
 its
 own
 servers,
 can


design
 their
 own
 data
 centers.
 But
 if


the
 cooling
 fans
 or
 pumps
 use


Chinese-made
 magnets,
 they're
 exposed
 to


Chinese
 export
 licensing
 by
 definition.


And
 Chinese
 licensing
 is
 now
 the


default.
 Trump's
 logic
 goes
 like
 this.


If
 we
 control
 more
 rare
 earth
 ore,
 we're


less
 dependent
 on
 China.
 But
 the
 problem


is
 that
 the
 ore
 isn't
 the
 bottleneck.


The
 biggest
 moat
 is
 processing
 of
 the


ore.
 If
 the
 United
 States
 acquired


Greenland
 tomorrow,
 it
 would
 solve


exactly
 0%
 of
 the
 rare
 earth
 problem.


Because
 Greenland's
 deposits
 won't


produce
 significant
 ore
 for
 10
 plus


years.
 And
 even
 after
 mining
 starts,
 the


ore
 would
 still
 need
 Chinese
 processing,


the
 very
 dependency
 Greenland
 was
 meant


to
 fix.
 This
 is
 why
 the
 bottleneck
 is


the
 processing
 capacity.
 Processing


being
 a
 very
 specialized
 chemical


engineering
 expertise.
 For
 example,
 rare


earth
 separation
 chemistry,
 which
 is


taught
 at
 maybe
 a
 dozen
 universities


globally,
 hazardous
 acid
 processing,


radioactive
 waste
 handling,
 toxic
 waste


handling.
 There's
 about
 2,000
 tons
 of


toxic
 waste
 per
 ton
 of
 rare
 earths.
 Now,


in
 the
 interest
 of
 being
 fair,
 the
 US


wouldn't
 be
 so
 interested
 in
 Greenland


if
 there
 was
 nothing
 more
 to
 it
 than


just
 the
 ore.
 So,
 why
 does
 the
 US
 want


it
 anyway?
 A
 ton
 of
 land.
 It's
 a
 ton
 of


physical
 location
 for
 data
 inensive
 tech


and
 data
 centers
 and
 subsequently
 free


cooling.
 On
 top
 of
 it,
 raiders,


satellite
 links,
 ground
 stations,
 space


awareness,
 early
 warning
 and
 missile


defense.
 As
 space
 becomes
 more


contested,
 permanent
 control
 of
 key


ground
 sites
 becomes
 more
 valuable.
 But


the
 paradox
 is
 that
 companies
 can


already
 build
 and
 lease
 in
 Greenland.


the
 ownership
 of
 the
 land,
 the
 ownership


of
 the
 country
 would
 only
 change
 the


political
 risk
 for
 Washington.
 So
 in


this
 equation
 for
 the
 US,
 this
 is
 a
 lot


less
 about
 technology
 or
 or
 minds


themselves.
 It's
 a
 lot
 more
 about
 the


nervous
 system
 of
 the
 western
 tech
 and


American
 defense.
 Reason
 number
 two,
 the


timeline
 is
 unachievable
 even
 under


extremely
 favorable
 assumptions.
 If


Greenland
 gets
 acquired
 or
 annexed
 in


2026,
 uranium
 ban
 repealed,
 full
 funding


secured,
 environmental
 permits


fasttracked,
 commercial
 scale
 rare
 earth


production
 lies
 7
 to
 10
 years
 into
 the


future,
 and
 processing
 capacity
 to


refine
 that
 ore
 is
 another
 3
 to
 5
 years


beyond
 mining.
 The
 US
 is
 attempting
 to


build
 this
 capacity,
 but
 it's
 going
 to


take
 another
 decade
 and
 even
 then


they'll
 process
 just
 a
 fraction
 of
 the


Chinese
 capacity.
 Meanwhile,
 AI


infrastructure
 deployment
 happens
 in


quarters
 and
 it's
 happening
 right
 now.


Microsoft
 Stargate
 project
 is
 underway


now.
 OpenAI
 is
 openly
 talking
 about


another
 order
 of
 10
 gawatts
 of
 power
 for


future
 models
 which
 is
 roughly
 a
 New


York
 Citys
 sized
 grid
 just
 for
 one


company
 and
 they
 need
 it
 now.
 Data


centers
 will
 consume
 around
 a,000


terowatt
 hour
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.


Greenland
 can't
 solve
 a
 problem
 that


manifests
 in
 2025
 with
 production
 that


starts
 in
 2023.
 And
 finally
 the


recycling
 problem.


The
 recycling
 problem
 is
 the
 elephant
 in


the
 room
 that
 gets
 a
 fraction
 of


attention
 compared
 to
 Greenland.
 In


April
 2025,
 several
 companies,
 including


Microsoft,
 piloted
 a
 hard
 disk
 recycling


project
 and
 announced
 the
 successful


recovery
 of
 rare
 earths
 from


approximately
 50,000
 pounds
 of
 shredded


and
 decommissioned
 hard
 disk
 drives,
 as


well
 as
 mounting
 hardware
 collected
 from


Microsoft's
 data
 centers
 across
 the
 US.


The
 project
 recovered
 around
 90%
 of
 the


rare
 earth
 materials,
 recaptured
 about


80%
 of
 the
 feed
 stock
 mask,
 including


gold,
 copper,
 aluminum,
 and
 steel,
 and


tested
 an
 acidfree
 recycling
 process


that
 can
 cut
 greenhouse
 gas
 emissions
 by


around
 90%
 compared
 to
 traditional


mining.
 But
 ironically,
 rare
 earth


recycling
 rates
 sit
 below
 10%
 in
 the
 US.


And
 if
 this
 program
 were
 to
 scale


globally,
 recycling
 could
 return


significant
 volumes
 of
 recovered
 rare


earths
 to
 the
 US
 without
 requiring
 new


ore
 extraction
 or
 new
 territories.
 And


the
 chemistry
 of
 this
 process
 is
 very


straightforward
 compared
 to
 mining.
 The


magnets
 are
 already
 separated
 from
 ore


and
 already
 in
 purified
 metallic
 form.


But
 instead
 of
 thinking
 about
 recycling,


we're
 choosing
 to
 think
 about


acquisition
 of
 new
 territories.


Conclusion.


So,
 is
 buying
 Greenland
 worth
 it
 from
 a


tech
 perspective?
 It
 depends.
 Does


buying
 the
 country
 solve
 the
 magnet


bottleneck
 problem?
 No.
 But
 does
 it


provide
 control
 over
 Greenland's


long-term
 tech
 advantage,
 including


space?
 Yes.
 Is
 it
 worth
 a
 geopolitical


blast?
 Not
 so
 sure.
 Technologically,


Greenland
 is
 absolutely
 valuable
 as
 a


critical
 mineral
 province,
 as
 a


potential
 green
 AI
 hub,
 and
 as
 a
 space


node.
 But
 the
 methods
 matter.
 By
 2025,


China
 dominates
 rare
 earth
 mining
 as


well
 as
 the
 entire
 supply
 chain.
 The


ore,
 the
 processing,
 the
 chemistry,
 the


magnets
 themselves.
 And
 you
 can't
 buy


your
 way
 out
 of
 that
 with
 a
 real
 estate


deal.
 We
 hope
 this
 was
 helpful.
