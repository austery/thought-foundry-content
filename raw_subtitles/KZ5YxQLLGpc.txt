Hi
 everybody,
 I'm
 Steve
 Pacin
 and
 we


welcome
 you
 to
 this
 historic
 hall,
 St.


Lawrence
 Hall
 in
 downtown
 Toronto
 for


another
 edition
 of
 TVO
 Today
 Live.
 Our


subject
 tonight,
 should
 Canada
 pivot
 to


China?
 We've
 got
 a
 full
 house
 here
 and


it's
 all
 possible
 thanks
 to
 the


generosity
 of
 the
 Wilson
 Foundation.
 Red


Wilson,
 thank
 you
 for
 your
 efforts
 and


continuing
 to
 support
 what
 we're
 doing


here
 on
 TVO.
 with
 us
 now
 to
 explore
 the


future
 of
 Canada's
 relationship
 with


China.
 Let's
 welcome
 Constantine


Curionopoulos,
 longtime
 board
 member


with
 the
 Canada
 China
 Business
 Council,


who's
 a
 critical
 minerals
 expert
 and


businessman,
 founder
 and
 now
 retired
 CEO


of
 the
 rare
 earth
 company
 NEO.
 Vina


Najibula,
 vice
 president
 research
 and


strategy
 at
 the
 Asia-Pacific
 Foundation


of
 Canada.
 Mary
 Ing,
 former
 member
 of


parliament
 for
 Markhamm
 Thornne
 Hill,


who
 is
 Canada's
 longest
 serving
 minister


of
 international
 trade,
 having
 served


from
 2019
 to
 earlier
 this
 year.
 And


Lynette,
 distinguished
 professor
 of


Chinese
 politics
 at
 the
 University
 of


Toronto
 and
 director
 of
 the
 China


Governance
 Lab
 at
 the
 Monk
 School
 at


uft.
 Let's
 welcome
 to
 St.
 Lawrence
 Hall


tonight,
 shall
 we?


Our


plan
 for
 tonight
 uh
 invited
 guests
 is


pretty
 simple.
 We
 are
 going
 to
 ask
 where


are
 we
 at
 with
 China?
 What
 are
 the
 risks


and
 opportunities
 of
 dealing
 more
 with


China?
 How
 should
 Canada
 approach


engaging
 with
 China?
 And
 ultimately
 the


big
 question,
 should
 we,
 as
 they
 say
 in


foreign
 affairs,
 pivot
 to
 China?
 So


that's
 on
 our
 itinerary
 tonight.
 Before


we
 do
 all
 of
 that
 though,
 I
 want
 to


survey
 this
 audience
 and
 get
 a
 sense
 of


where
 everybody's
 at.
 I'm
 going
 to
 ask


you
 two
 separate
 questions.
 So,
 let's


see
 a
 show
 of
 hands
 on
 these
 questions.


In
 light
 of
 our
 deteriorating


relationship
 with
 the
 United
 States,


Canada
 should
 actively
 re-engage
 with


the
 People's
 Republic
 of
 China.
 Hands
 up


and
 hands
 down.


We
 don't
 share
 the
 same
 values.
 They're


an
 authoritarian
 dictatorship.
 We
 should


not
 attempt
 to
 pivot
 to
 China.
 Hands
 up.


Interesting.
 Hands
 down.
 Okay.
 A
 lot


more
 yeses
 for
 the
 first
 question
 than


there
 were
 for
 the
 second.
 Good
 to
 know


what
 this
 audience
 thinks
 because
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 evening,
 I
 may
 just
 survey


you
 again
 and
 see
 if
 anybody's
 minds


have
 been
 changed
 by
 what
 transpired.


Meanwhile,
 let's
 get
 a
 few
 facts
 on
 the


table
 here
 to
 figure
 out
 where
 we
 stand.


In
 2024,
 Canada
 exported
 $30
 billion
 of


products
 to
 China,
 but
 we
 imported
 $87


billion
 worth.
 That
 said,
 there
 are
 big


tariffs
 going
 both
 ways.
 We
 have
 imposed


100%
 tariffs
 on
 EVs
 and
 25%
 on
 steel.


China
 has
 put
 100%
 tariffs
 on
 our
 canola


and
 25%
 on
 pork
 and
 seafood.
 So
 with
 all


of
 that
 in
 place,
 let's
 get
 the
 former


minister
 to
 work.
 First
 of
 all,
 as
 a


trading
 partner,
 how
 important
 is
 China


to
 Canada
 right
 now?


>> Well,
 China
 has
 been
 Canada's
 second


largest
 trading
 partner
 and
 I
 think
 in


the
 most
 recent
 numbers,
 they're
 now


third
 after
 Europe.
 So
 we
 have
 United


States,
 we
 have
 uh
 what
 was
 China,
 and


then
 Europe,
 and
 now
 it's
 uh
 it's


inversed.
 So
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 significant


economy
 in
 the
 world
 and
 China
 buys
 from


Canada.
 We
 sell
 uh
 to
 China
 and
 uh
 and


as
 you
 know
 as
 as
 a
 trade
 minister
 and


as
 you
 know
 looking
 at
 it
 for
 Canadian


businesses
 as
 a
 market
 to
 access
 I
 think


it's
 important
 to
 consider
 that
 that


there
 are
 jobs
 that
 are
 tied
 to
 that


very
 trading
 relationship.


>> This
 was
 a
 big
 part
 of
 your


responsibilities
 when
 you
 were
 the


minister.


>> Right.
 But
 having
 said
 that,
 Canadians


have
 often
 said
 to
 me
 and
 to
 the


government
 that
 we
 trade
 with
 values


that
 are
 really
 important
 to
 Canada
 as


well.
 Values
 like
 the
 rule
 of
 law,


values
 like
 um
 like
 our
 position
 on
 um


you
 know
 on
 fair
 wages
 or
 on
 the


environment
 or
 on
 on
 issues
 of
 uh
 of
 of


you
 know
 a
 range
 of
 issues
 that
 are


really
 important
 to
 Canadians
 around


human
 rights.
 Those
 values
 have
 to


intersect
 with
 an
 economic
 relationship


>> and
 we
 shall
 come
 back
 and
 consider


those
 of
 course
 during
 the
 course
 of
 our


evening.
 Constantine,
 how
 would
 you


answer
 the
 question
 about
 as
 a
 trading


partner
 the
 importance
 of
 China
 to
 us


right
 now?


There's
 no
 question
 that
 China
 is
 an


important
 trading
 partner
 in
 view
 of


your
 earlier
 question
 to
 the
 audience,


especially
 now
 when
 it
 seems
 that
 our


primary
 trading
 relationship
 with
 um
 our


friends
 south
 of
 the
 border
 is


deteriorating.


Canada
 is
 a
 trading
 state.
 Um,


multilateralism


has
 always
 helped
 Canada
 and
 I
 think
 in


view
 of
 what's
 been
 going
 on
 uh
 with


regards
 to
 uh
 to
 the
 United
 States,
 I


think
 we
 have
 no
 choice
 but
 to
 look
 for


expanding
 our
 trade
 with
 practically


everybody
 else
 including
 China,


including
 Europe,
 including
 India,
 the


Asia
 Pacific
 and
 ultimately
 we
 need
 to


go
 to
 where
 the
 markets
 are,
 where
 the


opportunities
 are.
 Um
 so
 yes
 the
 uh
 I


guess
 China
 is
 an
 important
 partner
 and


I
 think
 invariably
 it
 will
 have
 to


become
 a
 much
 bigger
 partner
 because
 the


deterioration
 of
 our
 trading


relationship
 with
 the
 the
 United
 States


presents
 an
 existential
 issue
 for
 the


country
 and
 we
 need
 to
 balance
 that
 risk


u
 by
 trading
 with
 folks
 that
 you
 know
 we


traded
 with
 in
 the
 past
 and
 perhaps
 we


can
 do
 more.


>> What
 say
 you
 Vita?
 Well,
 first
 of
 all,


it's
 wonderful
 to
 be
 on
 this
 panel.


Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 the
 invitation
 and


uh
 re
 really
 look
 forward
 to
 the


questions
 from
 the
 audience.
 Uh
 I
 think


when
 we
 say
 can
 China
 is
 our
 second


largest
 trading
 partner,
 we
 have
 to


recognize
 that
 the
 gap
 between
 number


one
 and
 number
 two
 is
 about
 70
 points.


So
 it
 almost
 means
 very
 little
 from
 76%


to
 less
 than
 4%
 in
 terms
 of
 our
 exports.


We
 trade
 with
 European
 Union
 more
 and
 we


trade
 with
 the
 CPTP
 countries,
 the


comprehensive
 progressive
 trans-pacific


partnership
 agreement
 uh
 countries
 more.


So
 yes,
 China
 is
 an
 important
 trading


partner,
 but
 we
 have
 to
 rightsize
 the


understanding
 of
 that
 and
 we
 also
 have


to
 recognize
 that
 when
 we
 do
 trade
 with


China,
 there
 are
 also
 risks
 involved
 and


especially
 when
 we're
 overdependent
 on


China
 for
 certain
 trade
 like
 in
 the


sector
 like
 canola,
 we're
 opening


ourselves
 to
 potential
 retaliation
 when


there
 are
 disagreements
 with
 China
 on


diplomatic
 or
 political
 issues.
 And


while
 it
 is
 obviously
 tempting
 to
 say


given
 that
 the
 US
 has
 become
 so


disruptive,
 we
 need
 to
 pivot
 and
 look


back
 at
 to
 China,
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to
 be


cautious.
 Yes,
 there
 are
 sectors
 in


which
 we
 can
 do
 with
 China
 more
 with


China
 and
 China
 of
 course
 is
 the
 second


largest
 economy
 in
 the
 world.
 So
 we
 will


have
 to
 but
 we
 have
 to
 be
 cautious.
 We


have
 to
 be
 cleareyed
 and
 we
 have
 to


derisk
 at
 the
 same
 time
 as
 we
 deepen


trade
 in
 some
 ways
 with
 China.
 So
 do


less
 in
 sectors
 where
 we're


overdependent
 and
 vulnerable.
 do
 less
 in


critical
 sectors
 which
 can
 open
 up


national
 security
 concerns
 and
 look
 at


other
 parts
 of
 Asia.
 Asia
 is
 not
 just


China.
 There
 are
 many
 other
 countries.


We
 have
 to
 diversify
 and
 we
 have
 to


reduce
 over
 reliance
 on
 both
 the
 US
 and


China.
 However
 disruptive
 the
 US,
 let's


not
 forget
 that
 China
 started
 the


disruption
 that
 has
 led
 to
 the
 kind
 of


crisis
 that
 we're
 in.


>> Lynette,
 your
 view
 on
 this?
 You
 know,
 I


think
 China
 is
 becoming
 more
 more


important,
 but
 I
 think
 in
 answer
 to
 your


earlier
 question
 about
 should
 we
 pivot


towards
 China,
 I
 think
 the
 answer
 is
 not


binary.
 I
 don't
 see
 that
 as
 an
 eitheror.


I
 think
 you
 know
 in
 the
 age
 of


uncertainty
 especially
 with
 what
 is


going
 on
 in
 with
 the
 US
 administration


right
 now.
 We
 should
 think
 about


diversifying
 risk.
 Um
 I
 would
 suggest


that
 you
 know
 for
 a
 long
 time
 if
 we
 take


a
 longer
 view
 of
 things
 right
 I
 think


Canada
 has
 been
 living
 in
 the
 margins
 of


great
 power.
 We
 have
 been
 a
 beneficiary


of
 economic
 prosperity
 and
 political


stability
 in
 the
 United
 States.


>> So
 we
 have
 been
 complacent
 in
 that
 sense


right
 and
 you
 know
 six
 months
 ago
 we


were
 jolted
 out
 of
 our
 complacency


>> and
 now
 we
 are
 thinking
 about
 the


question
 of
 whether
 or
 not
 we
 should


pivot
 towards
 China.
 I
 think
 the


question
 to
 to
 ask
 is
 is
 that
 in
 the
 age


of
 uncertainty
 how
 do
 we
 actually


diversify
 economic
 partnership
 and


political
 partnership
 I
 think
 with


political
 partnership
 we
 shouldn't
 be


looking
 towards
 China
 we
 should
 be


looking
 towards
 a
 with
 uh
 Europe
 and


other
 democratic
 countries
 as
 the
 prime


the
 prime
 minister
 has
 signed
 a
 deal


with
 with
 uh
 Europe
 with
 respect
 to


military
 um
 spending
 recently
 but


economic
 partnership.
 I
 think
 China
 is


an
 option
 and
 is
 a
 very
 important
 option


and
 as
 other
 panelists
 have
 alluded
 to


earlier,
 China,
 we
 shouldn't
 stop
 at


China,
 but
 we
 should
 start
 with
 China


because
 it
 is
 the
 second
 largest
 market.


But
 aside
 from
 China,
 we
 should
 also
 be


thinking
 about
 Indopacific
 countries


such
 as
 Japan,
 such
 as
 Southeast
 Asia,


such
 as
 India,
 so
 on
 and
 so
 forth.
 So
 I


would
 say
 China
 is
 a
 good
 place
 to
 start


but
 it
 is
 it
 shouldn't
 be
 the
 place
 to


end.


>> Mary,
 it's
 been
 fascinating
 to
 watch
 the


Canadian
 Chinese
 relationship
 over
 the


last
 let's
 say
 60
 years.
 Some
 of
 us
 can


remember
 when
 Prime
 Minister
 Pierre


Trudeau


>> opened
 to
 China
 before
 the
 United
 States


did
 and
 our
 relationship
 had
 its
 ups
 and


downs
 over
 the
 years.
 It
 got
 pretty
 good


under
 Jean
 Kretchan
 with
 the
 team
 Canada


trips.
 It
 got
 pretty
 bad
 under
 Justin


Trudeau
 for
 a
 while
 and
 then
 we
 heard


Mark
 Carney
 say
 a
 couple
 of
 different


things
 during
 the
 leaders
 debate
 when
 he


was
 running
 for
 he
 was
 the
 prime


minister
 running
 to
 keep
 his
 job
 he
 said


China
 was
 the
 biggest
 you
 know
 the


biggest
 problem
 he
 envisaged
 for


Canada's
 future
 now
 he
 talks
 about


strategic
 partnership
 a
 turning
 point


and
 he's
 going
 to
 visit
 shei
 what
 do
 we


make
 of
 all
 of
 that


>> so
 um
 I
 would
 agree
 with
 um
 you
 know


with
 what
 Vina
 was
 saying
 a
 little


earlier
 about
 um
 about
 needing
 to
 enter


into
 this
 relationship
 in
 a
 way
 that


really
 does
 balance
 the
 interests
 for


Canada
 as
 a
 rules-based
 democracy
 and
 to


the
 economic
 interests
 and
 opportunities


that
 are
 there.
 To
 your
 question
 about


uh
 you
 know
 about
 the
 pivot,
 I
 I
 I
 also


agree
 it
 is
 not
 a
 it's
 not
 an
 eitheror.


I
 think
 that
 given
 the
 geopolitical


headwinds
 that
 exist
 today,
 I
 think
 what


you're
 seeing
 in
 Prime
 Minister
 Carney


do
 is
 take
 a
 pragmatic
 approach
 around


the
 economic
 opportunity
 while
 at
 the


same
 time
 I
 don't
 think
 he
 has
 uh
 I


don't
 think
 that
 the
 position
 he
 took
 in


that
 debate
 has
 also
 changed.
 We
 do
 have


to
 consider
 the
 issues
 today.
 Uh
 when


you
 think
 about
 trade,
 it
 isn't
 just


let's
 it's
 a
 new
 market
 or
 an
 expanded


market.
 We're
 looking
 to
 do
 more


services.
 we're
 looking
 to
 do
 more


goods.
 It
 is
 not
 like
 that.
 I
 mean,


today
 when
 you're
 talking
 about
 trade,


you're
 also
 talking
 about
 trade
 in
 data


and
 AI


>> and
 critical
 infrastructure,


>> not
 just
 manufactured
 goods


>> and
 and and
 critical
 minerals.
 So,
 you


are
 talking
 about
 trade
 that
 is
 broad,


but
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 you're
 also


talking
 about
 tourism,
 you're
 talking


about
 education,
 you're
 talking
 about


agra
 foods
 and
 all
 the
 great
 things
 that


Canada
 has
 uh
 has
 to
 offer.
 So
 those
 are


the
 puts
 and
 takes
 that
 we
 have
 to


consider
 in
 Canada
 as
 you
 think
 about


this
 relationship.
 I
 think
 that
 there


are
 that
 there
 are
 additives
 to
 the


relationship
 and
 I
 think
 that
 there
 are


there
 are
 uh
 there
 there
 is
 a
 eyes
 wide


open
 approach
 to
 how
 you
 step
 through


it.
 But
 to
 the
 point
 of
 diversification,


I
 think
 that
 Canada
 as
 a
 middle
 power


country
 with
 partners
 in
 the
 CPTP,
 as


Vina
 said,
 CPTP
 includes
 countries
 like


Japan,
 like
 Singapore,
 like
 Australia,


like
 New
 Zealand,
 like
 Vietnam,
 like


Malaysia
 that
 are
 in
 a
 rules-based


structure.
 The
 United
 Kingdom
 has
 seeded


to
 it
 when
 I
 was
 the
 minister.
 Costa


Rica
 is
 going
 through
 that
 right
 now.


they
 are,
 you
 know,
 countries
 like


Indonesia,
 which
 uh
 that
 was
 the
 last


agreement
 I
 negotiated
 with
 with


Indonesia.
 Um
 these
 are
 economies
 where


under
 a
 rules-based
 system,
 under
 a
 CPTP


partnership,
 there
 are
 rules
 for
 how
 we


trade.
 So
 there's
 a
 disputes
 uh


resolution
 system
 when
 there
 is
 a


dispute
 to
 be
 had
 among
 the
 trading


partners
 and
 there
 are
 rules
 to
 which


you
 govern
 how
 you
 do
 your
 trade.
 How
 do


you
 deal
 with
 data
 governance
 in
 digital


trade
 for
 example
 among
 the
 partners?


Those
 are
 the
 very
 issues
 that
 that
 uh


that
 Canadians
 need
 to
 think
 about
 and


uh
 and
 that
 certainly
 government
 when


they're
 making
 policy
 trade
 polic


are
 you
 clear
 in
 your
 mind
 where
 the


prime
 current
 prime
 minister
 of
 Canada


stands
 in
 as
 much
 as
 he
 said
 one
 thing


during
 the
 leaders
 debate
 but
 he's


saying
 different
 things
 now


>> I
 think
 both
 things
 can
 be
 true
 at
 the


same
 time.
 So,
 China
 does
 represent
 a


threat
 to
 our
 national
 security
 and
 to


our
 economic
 security
 interests
 as
 well.


And
 we
 can
 unpack
 that.
 At
 the
 same


time,
 obviously,
 we
 do
 need
 to
 re-engage


with
 China
 at
 the
 highest
 level


diplomatically
 to
 be
 able
 to
 manage
 that


relationship.
 So,
 what
 Prime
 Minister


Carney
 is
 saying
 is
 that
 we
 need
 to
 talk


to
 all
 countries
 including
 those
 with


whom
 we
 have
 serious
 disagreements.
 But


the
 disagreements
 have
 not
 gone
 away.


Just
 because
 President
 Trump
 is
 being


really
 mean
 hasn't
 made
 China
 any


better,
 right?
 Right?
 So
 like
 I
 mean
 we


have
 to
 be
 able
 to
 hold
 multiple
 things


in
 our
 heads.
 And
 so
 with
 respect
 to


China,
 what
 he's
 proposing
 is
 that
 we


can
 do
 more
 on
 certain
 things
 where


interests
 align.
 Right?
 So
 he
 has
 this


frame
 framework
 of
 variable
 geometry
 of


engagement,
 right?
 That
 that
 will
 apply


also
 to
 kind
 of
 coalitions
 of
 uh


interests
 that
 we
 will
 build.
 But
 also


with
 certain
 countries,
 we'll
 have
 more


relationships
 because
 values
 and


interests
 align.
 With
 certain
 countries


like
 China,
 we
 may
 have
 certain


interests
 that
 align,
 but
 we
 have
 to
 be


cleareyed
 that
 our
 values
 do
 not,
 our


political
 systems
 do
 not,
 and
 all
 the


disagreements
 that
 we
 had
 before
 the


liberation
 day
 tariffs
 are
 still
 there


with
 China.
 Now
 the
 challenge
 becomes


because
 even
 with
 selective
 engagement


even
 saying
 we
 want
 to
 do
 more
 with


China
 on
 climate
 change
 we
 want
 to
 sell


them
 more
 of
 our
 energy
 exports
 uh
 from


TMX
 or
 from
 LG
 Canada
 we
 have
 to


recognize
 that
 we
 may
 wish
 to


compartmentalize
 but
 China
 doesn't
 do


that
 the
 Chinese
 Communist
 Party
 does


not
 generally
 compartmentalize
 if
 they


have
 an
 issue
 with
 you
 like
 they
 do
 now


with
 Japan
 over
 what
 the
 prime
 minister


said
 in
 response
 to
 a
 question
 from
 an


opposition
 member
 of
 parliament
 they


then
 target
 you
 by
 limiting
 travel
 of


tourists.
 They
 travel
 you
 by
 by
 they
 put


a
 ban
 on
 sale
 of
 certain
 uh
 exports.
 So


in
 other
 words,
 China
 does
 connect


issues
 and
 does
 weaponize
 dependence
 in


trade.
 So
 even
 on
 issues
 like
 energy,
 we


have
 to
 be
 cleareyed
 that
 we
 shouldn't


become
 overdependent.
 I
 guess
 that's
 the


final
 sort
 of
 lesson
 that
 we've
 learned


from
 the
 current
 experience
 is


overdependence
 on
 any
 trading
 partner


even
 one
 that
 used
 to
 be
 reliable
 like


the
 US
 is
 a
 bad
 idea
 in
 the
 current


environment.
 Let
 me
 get
 a
 sense
 from
 you


because
 I
 think
 you
 were
 part
 of
 those


days
 when
 Prime
 Minister
 Cretchan
 would


take
 a
 bunch
 of
 business
 people
 and


premers
 and
 so
 on.
 You
 were
 part
 of the


team
 Canada
 trips,
 right?
 25
 and
 30


years
 ago.
 Yes.


>> So,
 how
 does
 business
 h
 how
 do
 you
 run
 a


business


>> given
 that
 one
 day
 we
 can
 be
 friends
 and


our
 prime
 minister
 goes
 and
 visits
 and


brings
 huge
 delegations
 and
 the
 next
 day


things
 are
 pretty
 much
 cut
 off?
 Well,


the
 team
 Canada
 missions
 um
 were
 one
 of


the
 best
 thing
 that
 could
 happen
 to
 a


small
 company
 like
 ours
 because
 it


really
 opened
 doors
 and
 it
 brought
 us


legitimacy
 uh
 in
 front
 both
 of
 our


counterpart
 parties
 as
 well
 as
 the


government.


>> What
 kind
 of
 business
 were
 you
 trying
 to


do
 over
 there?


>> We
 started
 by
 uh
 buying
 controlling


interest
 in
 two
 rare
 earth
 production


plants
 in
 China.
 So
 we
 expanded
 that


business
 and
 two
 years
 ago
 when
 I


retired
 we
 had
 10
 plants
 around
 the


world
 including
 one
 in
 Peterbor
 Ontario.


Our
 headquarters
 was
 in
 Ontario
 here
 in


Canada
 in
 Toronto.
 Uh
 we
 had
 plants
 in


Thailand
 uh
 Korea
 uh
 Estonia
 and
 uh


Germany.
 So
 we
 we
 established
 a
 global


company
 but
 we
 started
 in
 China
 with


those
 two
 plans
 and
 our
 participation
 in


those
 team
 Canada
 missions
 made
 a


massive
 difference
 to
 to
 how
 we


developed.


>> So
 those
 were
 the
 good
 old
 days.
 What


what
 would
 you
 call
 what's
 going
 on


today?


>> Um
 it's
 it's
 we're
 recovering
 from
 the


bad
 days
 although
 we've
 seen
 ups
 and


downs.
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 relationship
 with


China
 has
 not
 been
 smooth
 all
 the
 way.


Um
 during
 the
 creten
 years
 it
 was
 a


period
 of
 growth.
 Um
 then
 during
 the


initial
 part
 of
 the
 Harper
 years
 things


slowed
 down
 and
 uh
 I
 remember
 things


picked
 up
 again
 when
 Minister
 Baird


started
 going
 to
 China
 and
 started


mending
 that
 relationship.
 Um
 and
 then


of
 course
 during
 the
 uh
 the
 Trudeau


years
 there
 was
 obviously
 the
 the
 two


Michaels
 but
 we
 behaved
 as
 a
 country
 in


ways
 that
 I
 I
 you
 know
 among
 friends
 I


call
 it
 we
 scored
 in
 our
 own
 net.
 Um,


and
 I
 think
 now
 with
 with
 Prime
 Minister


Carney,
 um,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 bit
 more


of
 a
 mature
 approach
 to
 international


relations.
 And
 listen,
 I
 mean,
 I
 in
 my


view,
 I
 even
 though
 I'm
 not
 a
 huge
 fan


of
 him,
 I
 I
 go
 by
 what
 Henry
 Kissinger


said
 that
 states
 have
 interests
 that


don't
 have
 friends.
 So,
 we
 need
 to


decide
 what's
 in
 the
 national
 interest.


And
 if
 we
 come
 across
 issues
 that
 are


not
 in
 the
 interest
 uh
 of
 Canada,
 then


we
 have
 to
 be
 wideeyed
 um
 cognizant
 of


what's
 going
 on
 and
 absolutely
 vigilant.


And
 I
 haven't
 heard
 anybody
 advocate


that
 we
 should
 go
 all
 in
 on
 the
 Chinese


relationship
 expanding
 with
 no
 barriers,


with
 no
 critical
 thinking.
 I
 think
 what


we're
 what
 is
 being
 advocated
 correctly


that
 we
 need
 to
 go
 in
 with
 our
 eyes
 wide


open.
 I
 think
 that
 applies
 to
 every


relationship
 with
 every
 state
 in
 the


world
 and
 by
 the
 way
 I
 don't
 want
 to


monopolize
 the
 time.
 Um
 the
 other
 thing


that
 um
 Henry
 Kissinger
 said
 that
 again


I
 you
 know
 it's
 engraved
 in
 the
 back
 of


my
 head
 for
 especially
 since
 the
 latest


uh
 Trump
 uh
 incarnation
 uh
 is
 that
 to
 be


a
 friend
 of
 the
 United
 States
 to
 be
 an


enemy
 of
 the
 United
 States
 is
 very


risky.
 to
 be
 a
 friend
 is
 lethal
 and


that's
 what
 we're
 finding
 ourselves


unfortunately.


So
 I'll
 say
 one
 more
 thing
 uh
 before
 I


stop.
 As
 a
 public
 company
 CEO
 um
 I


always
 had
 our
 company
 had
 to
 disclose


um
 any
 dependency
 with
 any
 customer


where
 your
 revenues
 were
 more
 than
 10%


of
 uh
 your
 total
 revenues.
 So
 in
 in
 the


business
 world
 public
 companywise
 uh
 a


10%
 dependency
 on
 any
 single
 customer
 is


a
 risk
 that
 you
 have
 to
 discuss
 how


you're
 going
 to
 address
 it
 or
 what


you're
 doing
 about
 it
 to
 protect
 the


interest
 of
 your
 shareholders.


>> I
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 number
 is
 when
 it


comes
 to
 countries.
 I'm
 sure
 it's
 not


75%.


I
 think
 he's
 just
 made
 the
 case
 for


diversification
 and
 doing
 more


diversification
 so
 that
 we
 are
 not
 going


to
 be
 dependent
 to
 anyone
 and
 that


Canada
 is
 in
 a
 position
 of
 being
 able
 to


create
 both
 sovereignty,
 strength
 and


determination
 for
 our
 future
 because
 of


that.
 And
 we
 need
 to
 absolutely
 do
 our


hardest
 to
 reinstitute
 multilateralism


because
 in
 the
 process
 some
 of
 the


global
 institutions
 that
 served
 our


interests
 very
 well
 over
 the
 last
 few


decades
 created
 by
 our
 American
 friends


are
 have
 been
 destroyed.
 I
 mean
 when
 was


the
 last
 time
 anything
 happened
 to
 WTO


>> World
 Trade
 Organization
 World
 I
 don't


think
 WTO
 is
 the
 answer
 and
 I
 think
 even


our
 prime
 minister
 recognize
 one
 of
 the


many
 things
 that
 need
 to
 come
 together


>> we
 have
 to
 work
 through
 plurilateral


groups
 not
 multi
 because
 this
 I
 mean
 we


have
 to
 be
 realistic
 right
 says
 that
 he


uses
 the
 word
 plurilateral


>> in
 fact
 in
 his
 economist
 oped
 which


hasn't
 gotten
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 visibility


here
 in
 Canada


>> should
 give
 a
 little
 love
 here


>> I
 think
 I
 got


>> you
 have
 a
 quote
 from
 him
 go
 for
 it


>> it's
 called
 the
 variable
 of
 geometry


Yeah,
 it's
 a
 variable.
 It's
 a


coalitions,
 interest
 based
 coalitions,


and
 he
 says,
 "In
 the
 twilight
 of


multilateralism,
 we
 have
 to
 turn
 to


plural
 pulled
 radalism
 or
 something
 like


that."


>> Well,
 okay,
 here's
 what
 he
 had
 to
 say.


This
 was


>> back
 in
 November
 in
 The
 Economist.
 You


know
 what's
 the
 prime
 minister's


approach
 to
 these
 issues?
 He
 says,


"Nostalgia


>> is
 not
 a
 strategy."


>> Is
 not
 a
 strategy.
 Exactly.
 We
 should


not
 pine
 to
 go
 back
 to
 the
 world
 that


was.
 We
 should
 focus
 on
 building


something
 better.
 The
 twilight
 of


multilateralism
 will
 be
 followed
 by
 the


rise
 of


>> pluril.


>> Plurilateralism.


>> I
 had
 it
 almost
 correct.


>> You
 got
 it
 right.
 No.
 States
 that


embrace
 variable
 geometry.
 You
 use
 that


expression.
 Weaving
 new
 networks
 and


constructing
 pragmatic
 alliances
 will
 be


best
 placed
 to
 thrive
 in
 this
 new
 age.


>> So
 I
 think
 Steve
 that
 is
 actually
 the


very
 definition
 of
 a
 middle
 power


>> right?
 We
 are
 a
 middle
 power
 because
 we


are
 prize
 taker.
 We
 cannot
 set
 we
 cannot


set
 rules.
 So
 when
 we
 deal
 with
 power


either
 with
 the
 United
 States
 which
 is


very
 hostile
 or
 undignificable
 like


China
 Canada
 as
 a
 middle
 power
 we


typically
 have
 to
 lean
 on
 multilateral


institutions
 because
 rules
 are
 stable.


But
 now
 that
 multilateral
 institutions


such
 as
 United
 Nations
 WTO
 or
 UN
 are
 not


that
 um
 reliable


>> what
 do
 we
 do?
 We
 need
 to
 rely
 on
 these


what
 Marani
 the
 prime
 minister
 call
 ad


hoc
 coalition
 of
 the
 willing.
 But
 I


think
 what
 has
 happened
 you
 know
 to
 give


you
 some
 examples
 of
 the
 coalition
 of


the
 willing
 such
 as
 against
 arbitrary


detention
 against
 China's
 monopoly
 of


critical
 minerals.
 These
 are
 very
 um


post
 um
 exposed
 measures.
 When
 things


happen
 then
 we
 think
 about
 putting
 the


coalition
 together.
 But
 I
 think
 we


should
 be
 preemptively
 thinking
 is
 bring


together
 coalition
 such
 as
 those
 that


have
 actually
 suffered
 trade
 coercion


against
 from
 China
 such
 as
 South
 Korea,


Japan,
 uh
 Australia,
 so
 on
 and
 so
 forth


and
 exchange
 notes
 about
 how
 do
 we
 deal


with
 these
 problems
 when
 we
 uh
 face


these
 issues.
 So
 I
 think
 you
 know


everyone
 has
 touched
 on
 the
 issue
 of


diversification
 of
 market.
 I
 would
 argue


that
 as
 a
 business
 person,
 it's
 actually


easier
 said
 than
 done
 because
 economies


like
 the
 idea
 of
 economies
 of
 scale.
 We


want
 to
 scale
 it
 up
 because
 we
 can
 lower


the
 cost.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 it's
 actually
 very
 difficult
 to


diversify.
 So
 if
 we
 could
 do
 some


>> preemptive
 approach
 such
 as
 gathering


together
 some
 coalitions
 to
 better
 deal


with
 China
 when
 problems
 come,
 I
 think


we'll
 be
 let


you
 can
 see
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 views
 on


this
 panel.


Um,
 one
 thing
 that
 I
 found
 interesting


in
 that
 oped,
 Steve,
 is
 that
 while
 the


prime
 minister
 talks
 about
 these


interest-based
 coalitions,
 the
 examples


that
 he
 gives
 are
 all
 Europe
 focused.
 So


he
 talks
 about
 the
 coalition
 of
 the


willing
 visav
 Ukraine.
 He
 talks
 about


safe
 Europe
 in
 terms
 of
 procurement
 that


Canada
 has
 now
 joined.
 Uh
 he
 even
 talks


about
 docking
 the
 CPTP
 trading
 block
 uh


that
 Mary
 spoke
 about
 with
 the
 EU
 so


that
 together
 they
 can
 create
 scale
 that


actually
 matches
 US
 and
 China.
 So
 at a


time
 when
 both
 US
 and
 China
 have
 become


protectionists,
 don't
 follow
 rules,


smaller
 countries
 have
 to
 come
 together


and
 the
 two
 biggest
 blocks
 would
 be
 EU


and
 CPTP.
 So
 and
 then
 one
 place
 where
 he


mentions
 China
 in
 that
 entire
 op-ed
 is


to
 do
 with
 climate
 and
 he
 says
 that
 we


can
 have
 a
 coalition
 around
 climate
 that


sort
 of
 uses
 Chinese
 and
 Indian


technology
 and
 European
 rules
 and


Brazilian
 sort
 of
 approach
 or
 something,


right?
 But
 that's
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 wish


list.
 It
 doesn't
 exist
 and
 nobody's


really
 talking
 about
 it.
 So
 the


interesting
 thing
 is
 that
 even
 in
 that


conversation,
 it's
 less
 about
 China.


It's
 more
 about
 diversifying
 and


building
 deeper
 relationship
 with
 other


non-
 major
 powers.
 Basically
 with


neither
 the
 US
 nor
 China
 to
 be
 able
 to


create
 rules-based
 trading
 where
 we


actually
 as
 a
 middlesized
 country
 have
 a


voice
 and
 we
 can
 exercise
 our
 interest


in
 a
 kind
 of
 in
 a
 way
 that's
 more


protective.
 So,
 and
 then
 a
 final
 thing


that
 I'll
 mention
 is
 yes,
 it's
 true
 that


75%
 of
 our
 trade
 is
 with
 the
 US
 and
 we


have
 to
 diversify
 that,
 but
 with
 China,


we
 have
 overdependencies
 already.
 So,


and
 it
 would
 be
 easy
 for
 us
 to
 just
 say,


you
 know,
 we
 need
 to
 deal
 with
 the


agricultural
 tariffs.
 We
 have
 to


continue
 to
 sell
 canola
 to
 them.
 Well,


we've
 had
 disruptions
 to
 canola
 trade


multiple
 times
 already.
 We
 have
 to
 learn


the
 lesson.
 It's
 like
 fool
 me
 once,


right?
 So
 we
 cannot
 continue
 to
 sell
 63%


of
 our
 canola
 seed
 to
 that
 market.
 So
 we


have
 to
 diversify,
 move
 up
 the
 value


chain.
 Same
 thing
 in
 terms
 of
 some
 of


our
 seafood
 products.
 97%
 going
 to
 China


market.
 I
 get
 it.
 It's
 an
 easier
 market,


but
 we
 have
 to
 do
 the
 hard
 work
 now.
 And


we
 have
 to
 be
 cognizant
 that
 China
 will


retaliate
 if
 we
 disagree
 with
 them
 on


other
 issues.
 Taiwan,
 Ukraine,
 all


linked.


>> It's
 all
 linked.
 Mary.


>> So,
 um,
 the
 work
 of
 diversification,
 I


absolutely
 agree
 for
 businesses.
 They


would
 much
 rather
 go
 into
 one
 single


market.
 It's
 way
 easier
 to
 do,
 but
 I


would
 say
 I
 have
 never
 had
 a
 mandate
 in


my
 entire
 time
 as
 trade
 minister
 that


did
 not
 have
 diversification
 in
 it.
 So,


in
 2018,
 the
 mandate
 the
 prime
 minister


gave
 to
 me
 was
 increase
 your
 non-
 US


exports
 by
 50%
 by
 2025.
 That
 was
 sort
 of


in
 the
 order
 of
 about
 $291
 billion.


We've
 done
 it.
 We've
 negotiated


agreements.
 If
 you
 think
 about
 the
 CPTP,


that
 covers
 a
 gigantic
 swath
 of
 Asian


markets
 that
 does
 not
 include
 the
 United


States,
 nor
 does
 it
 include
 China.
 We


are
 at
 the
 negotiating
 table
 with
 the


Association
 of
 Southeast
 Asian
 Nations.


By
 the
 way,
 all
 of
 them
 added
 up
 is
 700


million
 people.
 Uh
 CPTP
 500
 million


people.
 So
 you're
 talking
 in
 there
 sort


of
 you're
 heading
 towards
 about
 a


billion
 a
 billion
 people
 and
 that's


without
 China
 and
 without
 uh
 and
 without


the
 United
 States.
 So
 and
 and
 and
 to
 the


plural
 laterals
 that
 is
 essentially
 the


work
 that
 we
 have
 been
 building
 on
 right


I
 mean
 creating
 trading
 blocks
 on
 a


foundation
 of
 rules
 that
 allow
 market


access
 but
 that
 allow
 for
 things
 like


how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 treat
 your
 workers


within
 your
 economy
 so
 that
 there
 is


actually
 fair
 trade
 because
 in
 Canada


when
 you
 have
 a
 over
 you
 know
 an
 a


dumping
 of
 let's
 say
 a
 product
 right
 I


mean
 it
 depresses
 the
 prices
 and
 it
 you


know
 and
 and
 and
 it
 makes
 our
 companies


less
 competitive.
 Those
 issues
 are


actually
 dealt
 with
 at
 the
 trade


negotiating
 table
 whereas
 trading


partners
 you
 negotiate
 those
 rules
 and


you
 decide
 these
 are
 these
 are
 this
 is


what
 we're
 going
 to
 this
 is
 how
 we're


going
 to
 engage
 with
 one
 another
 and


then
 you've
 got
 dispute
 resolution


mechanisms
 that
 you
 are
 then
 bound
 by
 as


well.
 So
 I
 would
 say
 that
 Canada
 is
 in
 a


great
 place.
 Why?
 Because
 at
 present


with
 our
 existing
 trade
 agreements,
 we


already
 have
 access
 to
 65%
 of
 the


world's
 economy
 in
 Europe
 through
 the


CEDA
 block
 CPTP
 Indonesia
 which
 is
 the


fourth
 most
 populous
 country
 in
 the


world
 that's
 now
 done.
 Uh
 India
 is
 going


to
 you
 know
 is
 is
 is
 going
 to
 get
 worked


on.
 Uh
 and
 Azyen
 as
 a
 block
 is
 going
 to


you
 know
 is
 and
 and
 and


those
 negotiations
 by
 the
 way
 the
 AEAN


started
 in
 2016.
 ASEAN
 meaning
 the


Southeast
 Asian
 nations,


>> the
 Association
 of
 Southeast
 Asian


Nations
 and
 many
 of
 the
 countries
 that


are
 in
 ASEAN
 are
 already
 we
 already
 have


agreements
 with
 through
 CPTP
 like


Vietnam,
 like
 Malaysia,
 like
 Singapore.


>> Let
 me
 go
 to
 Lynette
 on
 this
 though.


>> The
 polarateral
 my
 point
 is


>> absolutely
 and
 we're
 doing
 that
 through


trade
 architecture.
 We
 need
 to
 keep


doing
 that.


>> Okay,
 let
 I'm
 going
 to
 remind
 everybody


the
 numbers
 I
 said
 earlier.
 In
 2024,


Canada
 exported
 30
 billion
 to
 China,


imported
 87
 billion.
 So,
 Lynette,
 my


question
 is,
 do
 they
 actually
 want
 to


buy
 stuff
 from
 us
 or
 just
 sell
 stuff
 to


us?


>> I
 think
 both.


>> It
 doesn't
 sound
 like
 it.


>> Well,
 you
 know,
 China
 is
 a
 much
 larger


country
 compared
 to
 in
 Canada,
 right?


And
 I
 would
 actually
 suggest
 that
 the


straw
 poll
 that
 you
 took
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 audience,
 the
 results


are
 actually
 not
 reflective
 of
 the


Canadian
 public.


>> That's
 right.


>> Right.
 I
 think
 the
 audience,
 if
 I
 could


use
 that
 word,
 is
 a
 self
 is
 a
 self-


selected
 one.
 Those
 people
 who
 come
 who


come
 to
 this
 event,
 they
 actually
 more


pro-China
 than
 your
 average
 Canadians.


So
 I
 think
 the
 issue
 of
 framing
 so
 you


say
 that
 Mark
 Carney
 say
 different
 thing


when
 he
 was
 a
 political
 candidate
 and


he's
 now
 a
 prime
 minister
 decision
 maker


is
 very
 different
 but
 his
 status
 has


actually
 changed.
 But
 I
 think
 what
 what


is
 also
 important
 in
 I
 think
 selling


China
 that
 we
 should
 engage
 China
 with
 a


lot
 of
 nuances
 is
 how
 we
 actually
 frame


that
 debate
 and
 this
 would
 be
 my


suggestions
 and
 I
 think
 you
 know
 public


opinion
 with
 respect
 to
 China
 has


changed
 drastically
 in
 the
 last
 six


months.
 There
 are
 now
 more
 people


unfavorable
 towards
 Washington
 DC
 than


towards
 Beijing.
 That's
 in
 China's


favor.
 And
 the
 other
 thing
 is
 that
 I


think
 we
 should
 think
 about
 uh
 China
 as


a
 very
 nuance
 as
 a
 very
 nuance
 uh


position.
 I
 think
 with
 the
 shifting
 of


the
 sand
 um
 we
 should
 not
 I
 would
 say


not
 keep
 talking
 about
 values.
 So
 a
 UBC


law
 professor
 say
 that
 we
 should
 frame


the
 debate
 in
 terms
 of
 maximizing


Canadians
 interest
 including
 treaty


obligations
 obligations
 to
 human
 rights


treaty
 which
 I
 would
 absolutely
 agree


because
 then
 countries
 like
 China
 cannot


say
 that
 we
 stand
 on
 uh
 moral
 high


grounds
 and
 criticize
 them
 because
 we


are
 just
 maximizing
 our
 interest.
 I
 I


think
 I
 I
 if
 I'm
 the
 prime
 minister,


which
 I
 am
 not,
 I'm
 also
 not
 in
 a


position
 of
 advising
 him.
 But
 if
 I
 have


the
 privilege,
 I
 would
 say
 to
 him
 that


think
 about
 how
 you
 actually
 sell
 the


question
 of
 engagement
 with
 China.
 The


framing
 is
 critical.


>> Constantine,
 you
 want
 to
 come
 in
 on
 that


on
 the
 issue
 of
 whether
 they
 actually


want
 to
 buy
 stuff
 from
 us
 or
 only
 sell


stuff
 to
 us?


>> Well,
 my
 experience
 is
 that
 China
 in


within
 China
 among
 the
 Chinese


consumers,
 Canada
 is
 a
 great
 brand.
 They


want
 to
 buy
 food
 stuff.
 They
 want
 to
 buy


the
 reason
 there's
 a
 reason
 why
 we


export
 so
 much
 fish
 because
 the
 Chinese


consumer
 wants
 Canadian
 fish.
 They
 want


Canadian
 products.
 Um,
 Arcterics
 is
 a


huge
 brand.
 It's
 no
 longer
 Canadian,
 but


it's
 a
 huge
 brand.
 There
 is
 an
 affinity


for
 things
 Canadian
 in
 China
 that,
 you


know,
 we
 need
 to
 continue
 to
 work
 on,


and
 that's
 why,
 you
 know,
 Canadian
 food


exports
 in
 in
 in
 China
 are
 what
 they


are.
 Um
 the


China
 is
 is
 a
 massive
 manufacturing
 uh


workshop.
 Okay.
 However,
 the
 advances


being
 made
 in
 China
 are
 really
 scary.
 I


think
 we
 need
 to
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 we


need
 to
 trade
 more
 is
 to
 continue
 to


engage
 so
 we
 can
 see
 what's
 coming
 down


the
 pike
 because


>> what
 do
 you
 mean
 scary?


>> I
 um
 I
 was
 in
 Beijing
 about
 a
 month
 ago


after
 one
 of
 my
 meetings.
 I
 walked
 into


uh
 an
 EV
 dealership
 by
 um
 Xiaomi.
 I
 was


blown
 away
 what
 you
 can
 buy
 in
 China
 for


$50,000.


>> And
 this
 is
 I
 guess
 what
 the
 100%


tariffs
 on
 Chinese
 EVs
 are
 designed
 to


protect
 us
 from


>> assuming
 that
 there
 was
 any
 thinking


going
 into
 those
 tariffs
 as
 opposed
 to


some
 reflexive
 uh
 reaction
 to
 what
 the


Americans
 did
 when
 they
 imposed
 100%


tariffs.
 And
 that
 actually
 is
 is
 is
 a


bit
 of
 a
 sore
 point
 for
 me
 because
 the


Europeans
 had
 imposed
 tariffs
 after
 two


years
 of
 study
 between
 17%
 and
 42%
 on


Chinese
 EVs
 into
 Europe
 and
 they
 went


through
 all
 the
 producers
 of
 EVs
 and


they
 had
 a
 different
 tariff
 rate
 for


each
 producer.


We
 you
 know
 the
 moment
 uh
 the
 US
 imposed


100%
 tariffs
 we
 jumped
 right
 in
 without


any
 thinking
 without
 any
 I
 don't
 I
 I


assume
 there
 was
 any
 thinking
 because
 it


was
 almost
 reflexive
 uh
 however
 we
 could


have
 taken
 an
 approach
 that
 much
 that


was
 much
 more
 analytical
 and
 by
 the
 way


Chinese
 government
 respects
 data
 and
 you


know
 the
 the
 European
 system
 would
 data


not
 that
 it
 helped
 much
 but
 still
 we


have
 a
 number
 of
 choices
 so
 when
 we


impose
 tariffs
 of
 100%
 %
 on
 Chinese
 EVs,


which
 by
 the
 way,
 we
 don't
 make
 any
 in


Canada
 yet.
 Uh
 what
 did
 we
 expect
 to


happen?
 I
 mean,
 what
 would
 have
 happened


if
 we
 imposed
 tariffs
 on
 American
 or


German
 producers?
 Uh
 would
 they
 have
 not


retaliated
 with
 tariffs
 on
 our
 products?


I
 mean,
 that's
 the
 way
 it
 works.
 So,
 do


the
 Chinese
 want
 to
 buy
 stuff?
 Yes,
 of


course.
 But
 you
 see,
 they
 want
 to
 buy


stuff
 that
 helps
 their
 own
 industry.
 So


we
 need
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 are
 the


materials
 and
 the
 products
 that
 we
 can


sell
 to
 them
 that
 you
 know
 fit
 both
 the


Canadian
 interest
 and
 the
 Chinese


interest.


>> Okay,
 we're
 about
 halfway
 through
 here.


So
 this
 is
 the
 point
 where
 I
 do
 what's


called
 a
 rrackcking.
 We
 remind
 everybody


what
 we're
 doing
 here.
 We
 are
 here
 in


downtown
 Toronto
 in
 the
 historic
 St.


Lawrence
 Hall.
 You
 know
 what?
 Sir
 John


A.
 Macdonald
 spoke
 in
 this
 hall.
 George


Brown
 spoke
 in
 this
 hall.
 Thomas
 Darcy


McGee
 spoke
 in
 this
 hall.
 No,
 I
 did
 not


cover
 any
 of
 those
 speeches
 despite
 what


what
 you
 might
 think.
 But
 I
 do
 remember


the
 last
 time
 I
 was
 in
 this
 hall
 was
 41


years
 ago


>> when
 there
 was
 a
 new
 leader
 of
 the


Progressive
 Conservative
 Party
 of
 Canada


named
 Brian
 Maloney
 who
 came
 here
 to


give
 a
 speech
 and
 I
 covered
 that
 speech


in
 this
 hall
 and
 it's
 magnificent.
 The


history
 here
 is
 just
 everywhere.
 Anyway,


we
 are
 talking
 something
 very
 different


tonight.
 We're
 talking
 China,
 Canada's


relationship
 with
 China
 going
 forward.


And
 I
 want
 to
 remind
 everybody
 who
 our


guests
 are.
 Can
 Constantine


Karionopoulos,
 board
 member
 at
 the


Canada
 China
 Business
 Council,
 Vina


Najibula,
 Vice
 President,
 Asia-Pacific


Foundation
 of
 Canada,
 Mary,
 former


Minister
 of
 International
 Trade
 for


Canada,
 and
 Professor
 Lynette,


University
 of
 Toronto
 and
 the
 Monk


School.
 Vina,
 I'm
 going
 to
 pick
 up
 the


conversation
 here,
 which
 is
 to
 say
 there


was
 a
 school
 of
 thought
 for
 a
 very
 long


time
 that
 if
 we
 open
 to
 China,
 if
 we


trade
 with
 China,
 if
 we
 try
 to
 make


things
 more
 normal
 with
 China,
 they
 will


liberalize.
 Goodness
 knows,
 they
 might


even
 become
 more
 democratic.


>> Yes.


>> Is
 there
 anybody
 who
 believes
 any
 of


that
 anymore?


>> Uh,
 I
 haven't
 met
 them
 recently,
 so


there
 might
 be
 still
 some
 people
 who


believe
 that,
 but
 I
 think
 most


>> So,
 is
 it
 worth
 doing
 then?
 Most
 would


agree
 that
 that
 was
 probably
 naive
 even


at
 the
 time.
 And
 if
 anything,
 I
 mean,
 if


you
 look
 now,
 we're
 becoming
 more
 like


China
 in
 that
 we're
 all
 resorting
 back


to
 industrial
 strategy
 and
 industrial


policy.
 We're
 all
 becoming
 more


protectionists
 and
 more
 mercantalists
 in


some
 ways.
 So
 whether
 or
 not
 the


experiment
 worked
 in
 the
 other
 way
 is
 I


think
 more
 interesting
 question
 right


now.
 So
 no,
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 economic


uh
 integration
 and
 engagement
 with
 China


led
 to
 any
 democratic
 development.


Certainly
 not
 in
 the
 last
 10
 years.
 I


mean
 we
 can
 we
 can
 unpack
 what
 happened


and
 did
 not
 happen.
 That's
 a
 bigger


question.
 But


>> but
 it
 did
 bring
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 of


people
 out
 of
 poverty
 in
 China.


>> Absolutely.
 And
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 is


due
 to
 the
 hard
 work
 of
 the
 Chinese


people
 rather
 than
 necessarily
 the


policies
 of
 the
 Chinese
 Communist
 Party


or
 even
 the
 engagement
 with
 the
 world.


So
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 all
 of
 that
 is
 true


but
 we
 have
 to
 go
 back
 to
 the
 question


that
 you
 asked.
 Does
 China
 want
 to
 buy


anything
 from
 Canada?
 I
 think
 that
 is
 an


important
 question
 in
 that
 the
 Chinese


growth
 model
 very
 much
 is
 exportd


driven.
 So
 more
 than
 $1
 trillion
 of


surplus
 in
 trade
 and
 it's
 growing.
 In


fact,
 even
 though
 the
 US
 market
 is
 now


closing
 to
 China,
 they're
 selling
 more


to
 Europe.
 They're
 selling
 more
 to


Southeast
 Asia.
 They're
 selling
 more
 to


Africa,
 Latin
 America,
 and
 they
 would


like
 to
 sell
 us
 more
 of
 their
 stuff,


too,
 including
 EVs.
 Constantine
 is


absolutely
 right.
 But
 we
 have
 to
 start


thinking
 about
 what
 kind
 of
 economy
 do


we
 want
 to
 have
 in
 Canada
 10,
 20,
 30


years
 from
 now.
 How
 do
 we
 maintain
 our


status
 of
 living?
 How
 do
 we
 stay
 a


prosperous
 developed
 country?
 We
 have
 to


continue
 to
 industrialize.
 We
 have
 to
 to


continue
 to
 invest
 in
 technologies
 of


tomorrow,
 not
 just
 sell
 the
 raw


materials
 with
 which
 we've
 been
 blessed.


So
 yes,
 China
 wants
 to
 buy
 our
 stuff
 in


the
 same
 way
 that
 they
 want
 to
 buy
 oil


from
 Russia
 as
 well,
 in
 the
 same
 way
 way


that
 they
 want
 to
 buy
 raw
 materials
 from


us.
 But
 do
 we
 want
 to
 just
 continue
 to


sell
 those
 products
 or
 do
 we
 actually


want
 to
 become
 a
 proper
 industrialized


country?
 And
 if
 that
 is
 the
 question,


then
 deeper
 engagement
 with
 China
 leads


to
 problems.
 Problems
 that
 we're
 now


seeing
 elsewhere
 in
 Europe
 as
 well
 as
 in


Southeast
 Asia.
 Right?
 They're
 also


worried
 about
 can
 they
 have
 a
 chance
 of


developing
 their
 own
 manufacturing
 and


domestic
 economy
 if
 China
 continues
 to


subsidize,
 continues
 to
 manipulate
 the


market,
 manipulate
 its
 currency
 and
 do


everything
 that
 it
 has
 done
 very


effectively
 to
 get
 to
 where
 it
 is.


>> Well,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 trade
 is
 a


reflection
 of
 comparative
 advantage.


there
 are
 reason
 why
 we
 are
 not
 selling


manufactured
 goods
 to
 China
 because
 they


are
 much
 lower
 cheaper
 labor
 costs
 right


I
 think
 that's
 a
 rule
 of
 economics
 um


I'm
 I
 am
 not
 sure
 whether
 I
 I
 buy


Trump's
 argument
 of
 you
 know
 every


country
 should
 become
 industrialized


should
 have
 more
 factories
 than
 China
 I


think
 I
 think
 there
 are
 reasons
 why


countries
 trade
 with
 each
 other
 our


comparative
 advantage
 lies
 with
 the


agricultural
 sector
 and
 services
 and


that's
 those
 are
 the
 things
 that
 we
 sell


we
 sell
 China
 and
 they
 sell
 manufactured


goods
 to
 us.
 um
 you
 know
 I'm
 not
 sure


you
 know
 industrialization
 is
 the
 way
 to


go
 for
 every
 countries
 um
 because
 of
 way


economics
 and
 comparative
 advantage
 and


labor
 cost
 cause
 works
 in
 theory
 that's


in
 theory
 the
 case
 Lynette
 I
 completely


agree
 with
 you
 that
 in
 ideal
 world
 once


you
 sort
 of
 move
 to
 a
 certain
 level
 the


wages
 have
 to
 go
 up
 and
 standard
 of


living
 have
 to
 go
 up
 and
 your
 currency


has
 to
 appreciate
 as
 well
 but
 when
 a


state
 actually
 controls
 all
 those


elements
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 as
 much
 as
 I


know
 that
 in
 China
 right
 Now
 the


consumers
 are
 less
 empowered.
 They
 can


spend
 more.
 Wages
 are
 suppressed.


>> Sure.
 Sure.
 Right.
 So
 there
 is


manipulation
 happening
 at
 a
 big
 scale
 by


the


>> I
 think
 that
 argument
 would
 apply
 to


countries
 like
 Indonesia,
 Viet,
 Vietnam


that
 has
 similar
 cost
 structure
 to


>> That's
 right.
 And
 they
 are
 suffering


right
 now


>> that
 China
 is
 subsidizing
 its
 labor


versus
 other
 countries.
 But
 for


countries
 like
 Canada,
 do
 we
 actually


want
 to
 build
 more
 factories
 to
 get
 more


of
 our
 young
 young
 people
 employed
 in


factories
 rather
 than
 services?


>> Depends
 what
 kind
 of
 factories.
 I
 think


we'd
 love
 to
 make
 more
 cars
 that
 high


paying
 jobs.
 You
 know,


>> I
 think
 we
 also
 we
 want
 high
 paid
 and


high
 value
 jobs.
 So
 industries
 are
 not


necessarily
 the
 way
 to
 go.


>> Yeah.
 Mary,
 let
 me
 ask
 you
 this.
 I
 I


wonder
 if
 to
 a
 certain
 extent
 if
 we


consider
 this
 issue
 of
 whether
 to
 pivot


to
 China,
 do
 they
 have
 us
 over
 a
 barrel


in
 some
 respects
 in
 as
 much
 as
 you
 know


everybody's
 watching
 how
 much
 trouble


we're
 having
 right
 now
 trying
 to


renegotiate


>> whatever
 we're
 calling
 it
 kusma
 or
 you


smack
 or
 whatever
 it
 is
 you
 know


>> you
 smack
 us


>> you
 smack
 they're
 smacking
 us
 all
 right


so
 in
 some
 respects
 they're
 seeing


what's
 happening
 between
 us
 and
 the


United
 States
 right
 now
 and
 presumably


the
 Chinese
 are
 thinking
 well
 they're


having
 trouble
 over
 there.
 So,
 we
 should


take
 advantage
 of
 that.
 Isn't
 that
 the


case?


>> I
 wouldn't
 look
 at
 it
 quite
 that
 way.


Um,
 they
 may
 very
 well,
 but
 I
 think
 for


Canadians,
 Canadians
 have
 to
 ask


ourselves
 the
 question,
 where
 do
 we
 want


to
 be?
 What
 do
 we
 need
 to
 do
 to
 have
 the


economy
 we
 want
 in
 the
 future?


>> This
 is
 something
 you
 and
 Vina
 agree
 on.


>> Yes.
 I
 mean,
 what
 what
 can
 we
 do
 within


the
 country
 to
 remove
 interprovincial


trade
 barriers
 so
 that
 we
 are
 more


competitive
 ourselves
 as
 a
 country?


Turns
 out
 the
 answer
 is
 not
 that
 much.


>> Well,
 at least
 we
 haven't
 done
 too
 much


so
 far.


>> We
 Well,
 we
 need
 to
 do
 more.
 And
 uh
 and


and
 how
 do
 we
 look
 at
 the
 kind
 of
 value


chains
 that
 we
 want
 and
 supply
 chains


that
 we
 want
 and
 with
 whom
 do
 we
 want


that
 with
 today?
 So
 given
 the
 issues


that
 we
 are
 facing
 with
 the
 United


States,
 you
 have
 to
 then
 make
 a
 choice.


Who
 else
 in
 the
 world
 do
 you
 want
 to
 be


doing
 this
 with?
 Right?
 I
 mean
 so
 if
 you


think
 about
 critical
 minerals
 critical


minerals
 um
 we
 have
 an
 abundance
 we
 want


to
 also
 do
 value
 add
 processing
 in


addition
 to
 the
 sustainable
 extraction


we
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 partner
 with
 whom


in
 those
 investments
 for
 the
 extraction


and
 then
 the
 deployment
 of
 those
 you


know
 of
 the
 of
 of
 of
 what
 comes
 out
 of


the
 critical
 minerals
 to
 aerospace
 to


clean
 technology
 to
 the
 range
 of
 sectors


in
 industry
 industries
 that
 are
 out


there
 and
 who
 do
 you
 want
 to
 do
 that


with?
 China
 is
 a
 choice
 but
 should
 it
 be


the
 only
 choice?


>> Nobody
 I
 don't
 think
 anybody's
 saying
 it


is.


>> No.
 Or
 well
 and
 well
 I
 would
 I
 would
 say


that
 that
 today
 it's
 a
 it
 today
 is
 a


perfect
 time
 where
 we
 ought
 to
 be


looking
 at
 the
 trading
 partners
 that
 we


want
 to
 pursue
 and
 who
 want
 to
 pursue


us.
 You
 were
 talking
 about
 those
 trade


missions
 that
 are
 very
 effective.
 In
 my


time
 as
 trade
 minister,
 I
 have
 taken


trade
 missions
 into
 every
 single
 CPTP


and
 ASEAN
 country.
 Every
 single
 one.
 And


as
 a
 minister,
 it's
 one
 thing
 for
 me
 to


say
 I
 would
 like
 to
 take
 a
 trade


mission.
 It
 only
 happens
 when
 businesses


themselves
 think
 that
 there's
 a
 market


that
 there
 are
 investors
 that
 they
 can


go
 there
 and
 that
 they
 want
 to
 use
 the


value
 of
 their
 federal
 government
 to


open
 that
 door
 and
 get
 them
 there.
 And


guess
 what?
 They
 want
 to
 go
 to
 CPTP.


They
 want
 to
 go
 into
 Azen.
 They
 want
 to


go
 to
 Europe
 elsewhere
 but
 but but
 as
 a


choice
 that
 I
 think
 is
 the
 choice.


>> There's
 been
 talk
 about
 we
 talk
 about


critical
 minerals
 but
 we
 haven't
 done


much.
 We
 have
 abandoned
 industrial


strategy
 to
 the
 hands
 of
 the
 Chinese.


>> Yes.
 We're
 importing
 strategy.


>> China
 did
 what
 China
 had
 to
 do
 for
 its


own
 interest.
 We're
 coming
 back
 to
 Henry


Kissinger
 and
 states
 having
 interests.


What
 are
 we
 doing
 about
 our
 own
 citizens


interest?
 Let
 me
 give
 you
 an
 example,


Stephen.
 According
 to
 the
 Glob
 and
 Mail


a
 year
 ago,
 the
 Canadian
 government
 has


committed
 to
 subsidies
 worth
 about
 55


billion
 dollars
 over
 the
 next
 15
 years


to
 the
 the
 automotive
 industry
 for
 EVs.


Y


>> some
 of
 it
 is
 real
 cash,
 some
 of
 it
 is


tax
 points,
 etc.


How
 much
 of
 that
 madame
 minister


went
 into
 critical
 mineral
 development?


>> What's
 the
 answer?
 Zero.


>> Zero.


>> And
 let
 me
 ask
 you
 the
 other
 question


which
 I
 asked


>> that's
 actually
 not
 true.


>> But
 the
 critical
 mineral
 strategy
 has


money.


>> So
 it's
 not
 so
 it's
 not
 called


industrial
 like
 sort
 of
 developing
 but


there
 is
 a
 whole
 critical
 minerals


source
 strategy
 and
 a
 pot
 of
 money
 that


actually
 went
 specifically
 to
 that.
 So


>> well
 not
 in
 relation
 to
 the
 55
 billion


that
 was
 spent
 on
 automotive
 industry


different
 and
 who
 is
 the
 what
 industry


is
 the
 largest
 consumer
 of
 critical


minerals
 today
 and
 the
 fastest
 growing


industry


>> EVs


>> fact
 of
 life
 batteries
 lithium
 and


batteries
 and
 rare
 earth's
 for
 earth


magnets
 driving
 the
 electric
 motors
 how


many
 plants
 do
 we
 have
 in
 Canada
 that


can
 take
 raw
 materials
 from
 the
 ground


and
 transform
 them
 into
 the
 materials
 I


need
 to
 go
 into
 the
 batteries
 and
 the


motors.


>> Zero.


>> Zero.
 But
 if
 today,


>> but
 there've
 been
 lots
 of
 announcements


about
 building
 some,
 right?


>> That's
 right.
 Over
 the
 years,


>> through
 the
 major
 projects
 as
 well.


Through
 the
 major
 projects.


>> I
 can
 tell
 you
 that
 there's
 only
 two


plants
 in
 the
 world
 that
 produce
 rare


earths
 in
 commercial
 large
 scale


quantities
 outside
 of
 China.
 One
 in


Malaysia
 owned
 by
 an
 Australian
 company


and
 one
 in
 Europe
 in
 Estonia
 owned
 by
 my


former
 company.
 But
 but
 currently
 the


Ford
 are
 making
 announcements
 all
 the


time
 about
 new
 factories
 being
 built


here.


>> We
 have
 to
 wait.
 However,
 here's
 the
 the


fallacy
 with
 just
 talking
 about
 critical


minerals
 and
 continuing
 to
 approach
 the


world
 like
 we
 continue
 to
 be
 hers
 of


wood
 and
 drawers
 of
 water.
 We
 can
 dig


holes
 in
 the
 ground
 until
 the
 cows
 come


home.
 But
 today
 the
 only
 market
 for
 the


output
 of
 these
 holes
 in
 the
 ground


lithium
 and
 rare
 earths.
 Perhaps
 copper


is
 a
 bit
 more
 global
 uh
 the
 situation.


But
 if
 we
 dug
 raris
 and
 lithium
 out
 of


the
 ground,
 the
 only
 place
 we
 could
 ship


it
 would
 be
 China
 because
 that's
 where


the
 conversion
 and
 the
 value
 the
 value


refining
 capacity.
 Unless
 we
 could
 have


taken
 one
 of
 those
 55
 billion
 and
 said


we
 will
 build
 or
 we
 will
 facilitate
 the


creation


>> taking
 you
 know


>> you
 know
 I
 understand
 you
 and
 you


represent
 the
 business
 council
 the
 the


business
 corporation.
 I've
 gone
 a
 little


bit


>> but
 but
 you
 know
 but
 I
 think
 if
 we
 think


about


>> I
 pay
 you
 a
 lot
 of
 taxes
 in
 Canada.


>> I
 understand
 that.
 I
 understand
 that.
 I


understand
 that.
 I
 think
 if
 we
 think


about
 the
 interest
 of
 the
 countries
 as
 a


whole
 is
 divided
 into
 producers
 and


consumers.


>> Producers
 have
 the
 power
 political
 power


to
 organize
 lobby
 group
 and
 get
 business


council
 to
 represent
 them.
 Consumers


no
 and
 and
 and
 consumers
 do
 not.
 So
 if


we
 think
 about
 Chinese
 EVs
 right
 now
 we


don't
 have
 any
 EV
 plants.
 So
 if
 we
 allow


cheap
 EVs
 to
 come
 in,
 it
 might
 hurt
 our


EV
 producers
 in
 the
 future,
 but
 our


consumers
 would
 benefit
 tremendously.


And
 that's
 a
 welfare
 gain
 that
 we
 don't


read
 about
 in
 the
 Globe
 and
 Mail
 in
 the


Star
 all
 because


>> consumers
 are
 the
 silent
 majority
 that


don't
 have
 political
 voices.
 I
 hear
 you.


Let's
 not
 forget
 that.
 I
 don't
 want
 the


clock
 to
 get
 I
 don't
 want
 the
 clock.


Hang
 on
 a
 second.
 Time
 out.
 Time
 out.


cuz
 I
 the
 clock
 is
 going
 to
 get
 away


from
 us
 and
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 a


chance
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 other
 thing


that
 we
 have
 to
 mention
 here
 which
 are


the
 risks.
 We've
 talked
 about
 a
 lot
 of


the
 opportunities
 we've
 talked
 about.


Okay,
 we
 got
 to
 get
 into
 the
 risks
 here


and
 I'm
 going
 to
 give
 you
 a
 bit
 of
 a


list
 here
 and
 then
 I'm
 going to
 go
 to


you
 and
 see
 what
 concerns
 you.


There
 are
 a
 long
 list
 of
 reasons
 to
 be


concerned
 about
 increased
 engagement


with
 China,
 intimidation
 of
 expats
 and


diaspora
 communities.
 Espionage,


welldocumented
 election
 interference
 in


this
 country,
 China's
 support
 of


Russia's
 war
 machine
 against
 Ukraine,


long-standing
 threat
 to
 Taiwan,
 human


rights
 violations,
 persecution
 of


religious
 minorities,
 some
 labor


practices
 which
 do
 not
 stand
 up
 to
 light


very
 well.
 Vina
 that
 list
 or
 maybe


something
 else.
 What's
 the
 biggest
 risk


to
 Canada
 if
 we
 re-engage
 with
 China?


>> Well,
 the
 good
 news,
 Steve,
 is
 that
 we


have
 been
 speaking
 about
 being
 cautious


and
 considering
 those
 risks,
 including


economic
 risk,
 which
 I
 think
 we
 were


trying
 to
 get
 at
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 kind
 of


industries
 we
 want
 to
 have.
 So,
 we're


we're
 deep
 into
 that
 part
 of
 the


conversation
 is
 the
 kind
 of
 risks
 and


how
 do
 we
 manage
 those
 risks
 because


again,
 the
 answer
 is
 not
 this
 binary


choice
 of
 do
 we
 engage
 with
 China
 or
 do


we
 not.
 I
 think
 everybody
 on
 this
 panel


says
 yes,
 we
 have
 to
 up
 our
 game
 in


terms
 of
 engagement
 with
 China.


>> Yes,
 but


>> yes,
 but
 exactly.
 Or
 yes
 and


>> or
 yes
 and


>> yes.
 So
 yes,
 we
 do
 need
 to
 engage
 more


and
 have
 more
 dialogue,
 more


understanding
 of
 China
 at
 all
 levels,


business,
 academia,
 government
 and
 we


have
 to
 be
 cognizant
 that
 there
 are
 many


many
 risks
 which
 need
 to
 be
 managed.
 So


I
 did
 a
 piece
 for
 policy
 magazine


recently
 where
 I
 sort
 of
 laid
 out
 kind


of
 six
 elements
 that
 have
 to
 be
 in
 place


for
 us
 to
 do
 more
 with
 China
 right
 so


and
 it
 begins
 with
 guard
 rails
 around


the
 areas
 which
 we
 want
 to
 protect
 so
 be


that
 sensitive
 technologies
 be
 that


research
 so
 whatever
 that
 list
 is


>> democracy


>> sure
 foreign
 interference
 our
 yes


there's
 a
 long
 list
 right
 so
 there's
 the


guardrail
 piece
 then
 there
 is
 the
 area


where
 we
 have
 to
 be
 clear
 on
 the
 stuff


that
 we
 want
 to
 do
 more
 of
 what
 are
 the


specific
 sectors
 we
 have
 to
 get
 granular


right?
 Like
 it's
 no
 longer
 just
 about


let's
 sell
 more
 or
 let's
 buy
 more.
 We


have
 to
 get
 more
 specific,
 right?
 Then


we
 have
 to
 have
 the
 actual
 tools
 to
 be


able
 to
 to
 protect
 ourselves.
 So
 all
 of


the
 things
 that
 we
 haven't
 yet


mentioned,
 we've
 mentioned
 some
 of
 the


kind
 of
 the
 positive
 things
 around


subsidies
 or
 critical
 mineral
 strategy


or
 whatever,
 but
 we
 also
 need
 to
 have


screening
 mechanisms,
 investment


screening
 mechanisms.


>> Do
 we
 have that
 yet?


>> Uh
 so
 we
 we
 have
 investment
 act,
 but
 it


needs
 to
 actually
 be
 better
 applied.


Right
 now
 it's
 very
 discretionary
 to
 the


minister.
 It's
 unclear.
 So
 it
 makes
 the


system
 less
 predictable.
 Um
 so
 there
 are


a
 number
 of
 other
 thing
 and
 then
 we
 have


to
 build
 coalitions
 because
 alone
 we


will
 never
 have
 leverage
 visav
 China.
 So


we
 still
 it's
 very
 hard
 because
 US
 used


to
 lead
 all
 of
 this
 and
 we
 used
 to
 kind


of
 follow
 as
 a
 western
 block.
 We
 have
 to


now
 be
 used
 to
 a
 world
 in
 which
 US
 does


not
 lead
 right.
 So
 and
 we
 have
 to
 show


leadership
 and
 with
 other
 European
 uh


Asian
 democracies
 to
 be
 able
 to
 together


figure
 out
 how
 to
 manage
 risks.
 So
 again


yes
 there
 are
 many
 many
 risks
 but
 the


answer
 remains
 the
 same.
 We
 have
 to


continue
 to
 talk
 to
 China
 engage
 with


China
 and
 we
 have
 to
 build
 leverage


domestically
 and
 we
 have
 to
 build


competence
 domestically.
 So
 Lynette


mentioned
 about
 the
 attitude
 in
 the


general
 public.
 It
 is
 still
 fairly


negative
 towards
 China
 but
 there's
 also


very
 low
 level
 of
 understanding
 of
 China


of
 Indonesia
 of
 Malaysia
 of
 all
 these


other
 countries.
 Right?
 So
 I
 mean
 I
 live


in
 Vancouver
 where
 we
 do
 feel
 like
 a


Pacific
 nation
 but
 when
 you
 come
 east
 as


much
 as
 we
 talk
 about
 being
 a
 Pacific


nation
 it's
 a
 very
 euroentric


Euroatlantic
 kind
 of
 place
 and
 in
 order


to
 be
 able
 to
 engage
 you
 have
 to
 know


the
 other
 side
 right
 and
 we
 have
 to


invest
 in
 that.


>> Constantine
 does
 it
 give
 you
 any
 pause


that
 if
 we
 do
 dive
 in
 deeper
 with
 China


we
 are
 potentially
 inviting
 the
 Chinese


Communist
 Party
 to
 have
 a
 bigger
 role
 in


Canada?


>> Yes.


>> Pause.
 Yeah.
 And
 listen,
 I
 mean
 there


are
 there
 are
 countries
 that
 we
 trade


with
 that
 we
 have
 to
 be
 absolutely


careful
 about
 what
 we
 do
 and
 how
 we
 do


it.
 And
 that's
 pretty
 well
 everybody.


However,


there's
 no
 question
 we
 have
 to
 continue


to
 be
 vigilant.


>> Okay?
 We
 need
 to
 protect
 the
 national


interest.
 Now,
 we
 also
 need
 to
 learn


from
 successful
 examples
 from
 others.
 I


I
 look
 at
 the
 Australians.
 Who
 was
 the


beneficiary
 of
 Canadian
 canola
 oil
 not


going
 to
 China?
 Australia
 and
 Brazil.
 Do


we
 have
 a
 problem
 with
 the
 way
 the


Australians
 run
 their
 uh
 their
 country


or
 their
 businesses
 with
 the
 Chinese?
 I


mean,
 they
 they
 had
 trade
 frictions.


They're
 part
 of
 the
 five
 eyes.
 They're


buying
 nuclear
 subs.
 And
 guess
 where


those
 subs
 are
 going
 to
 be
 patrolling?


They're
 not.
 It's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 the


Arctic
 or
 the
 Pacific.
 It's
 probably
 the


South
 China
 Sea.
 But
 and
 yet
 their


trading
 relation
 their
 trade
 relation


with
 China
 continues
 to
 increase.
 Wine


is
 going
 back
 into
 China.
 Uh
 ironor
 has


never
 stopped
 going
 into
 China
 from


Australia.
 So
 I
 think
 we
 need
 to
 look
 at


what
 others
 are
 doing
 and
 how
 successful


they
 are.
 And
 every
 once
 in
 a
 while
 the


Australians
 when
 Chinese
 investment
 is


trying
 to
 control
 sensitive
 parts
 of


their
 industry,
 they
 say
 no.
 So
 they


they're
 cognizant
 and
 they're
 very


vigilant
 and
 I
 think
 you
 can
 do
 we
 can


probably
 um
 thread
 the
 needle
 perhaps
 a


bit
 more
 carefully
 than
 we
 have
 done
 so


in
 the
 past.


>> Let
 me
 give
 a
 heads
 up
 to
 this
 audience.


You
 see
 the
 microphone
 placed
 in
 the


middle
 of
 the
 room.
 So
 I'm
 going
 to
 ask


one
 more
 question
 here
 and
 then
 we're


going
 to
 start
 to
 take
 questions
 from


you
 folks.
 So
 let
 me
 throw
 this
 phrase


that
 Mark
 Carney
 used
 in
 his
 November


piece
 in
 the
 Economist
 variable


geometry.
 as
 a
 plausible
 approach
 to


engaging
 China.
 Mary,
 what
 what
 do
 you


interpret
 that
 to
 mean
 and
 should
 we
 do


it?


>> I
 think
 we
 uh
 talked
 about
 that
 a
 little


bit
 earlier.
 The
 variable
 geometry
 that


leads
 to
 pluralateralism.


Pluralateralism
 is
 just
 simply
 creating


different
 partnerships
 with
 others
 who


who
 you
 could
 create
 some
 um
 uh
 common


ground
 with
 um
 a
 set
 of
 interests.
 So


getting
 away
 from
 values
 but
 from


interest
 that
 you
 have
 shared
 interests


with
 and
 to
 do
 that
 together
 in
 a
 way


that
 uh
 in
 a
 way
 that
 actually
 will
 help


you
 have
 the
 kind
 of
 leverage
 and
 the


influence
 that
 you
 will
 need
 beyond


yourself.
 So
 that


>> are
 we
 well
 poised
 to
 do
 it?


>> I
 think
 we
 absolutely
 are.
 I
 think
 we


are
 as
 a
 middle
 country.
 I
 think
 that


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 that
 has
 to
 be


done
 to
 do
 that.
 But
 do
 are
 we
 poised
 as


Canada?
 Yes.
 We
 we
 know
 how
 to
 do
 this.


We
 have
 partners
 around
 the
 world
 that


we
 could
 do
 it
 with
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 we


need
 to
 get
 on
 and
 do
 it.
 That
 list
 that


you
 talked
 about,
 it's
 not
 just
 Canada


that
 has
 that
 that
 that
 has
 that
 list.


It's
 many
 other
 countries.
 So,
 you're


going
 to
 have
 other
 middle
 powers.


you're
 going
 to
 have
 other
 people
 in


that


variable
 geometry
 set
 that
 you
 can
 work


with
 to
 identify
 interests
 that
 uh
 that


allow
 us
 to
 then
 engage
 and
 have
 those


conversations
 with
 China
 where
 it's
 more


than
 just
 Canada.
 It's
 an
 entire
 group


of
 you
 know
 of
 of
 of


countries
 of
 allies
 where
 those
 very


interests
 perhaps
 those
 are
 the


interests
 and
 you
 actually
 have
 those


conversations
 um
 you
 have
 that


engagement.
 It's
 not
 conversation.
 You


have
 an
 engagement
 that
 could
 try
 to
 get


you
 into
 uh
 a
 more
 meaningful.


>> So
 what
 relationship?


>> So
 when
 Mark
 Honey
 talks
 about
 variable


of
 geometry,
 what
 appears
 in
 my
 mind
 is


a
 van
 diagram
 with
 multiple
 concentric


circle
 that
 overlap
 with
 each
 other.


Right?
 One
 could
 represent
 arbitrary


detention.
 The
 other
 one
 could
 represent


monopoly
 of
 critical
 mineral
 supply.
 And


we
 could
 have
 a
 multiple
 circles


to
 cope
 with
 the
 re
 the
 is
 the
 issue
 of


China
 such
 as
 electoral
 interference,


trade
 coercion,


uh
 so
 on
 and
 so
 forth
 which
 we
 haven't


done
 and
 I
 think
 the
 thing
 about


guardrail
 preemptive
 guardrail
 that
 we


should
 put
 in
 place
 as
 we
 proceed
 with


our
 relationship
 with
 China
 be
 it


engagement
 or
 or
 deeper
 relationship


these
 are
 the
 concentric
 circles
 that
 I


think
 we
 should
 be
 thinking
 about
 pre


preempt
 ly
 before
 problems
 actually


emerge.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 think
 this
 is
 the
 one
 place


where
 uh
 Mary
 and
 I
 have
 a
 slightly


different
 view.
 Can
 it
 be
 done?
 Yes.
 Are


we
 currently
 ready
 to
 do
 that?
 I
 I'm
 not


sure
 because
 as
 as
 Lynette
 is
 saying,
 we


have
 been
 so
 reactive
 to
 what
 China


does,
 right?
 Rather
 than
 proactively


have
 a
 really
 clear
 understanding
 of


what
 it
 is
 that
 we
 want
 from
 China
 and


what
 it
 is
 that
 we
 are
 not
 going
 to
 do.


And
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to
 also
 recognize


that
 China
 is
 not
 just
 any
 other
 actor.


So
 Constantine
 constantly
 says
 with


everybody
 does
 that.
 Well,
 China
 is
 m


CCP
 is


communist
 Chinese
 party.
 It's
 it's
 much


much
 more
 powerful
 than
 any
 other


country.
 It's
 now
 a
 peer
 state
 to
 the


US.
 So
 it's
 not
 just
 another
 middle


power
 that
 we
 have
 to
 kind
 of
 manage


relations
 with.
 We
 have
 to
 recognize


their
 economies
 40
 times
 the
 size
 of


ours.
 There
 have
 been
 at
 this
 game
 of


essentially
 creating
 asymmetric


dependencies
 for
 15
 20
 years.
 They're


ahead
 of
 us
 on
 so
 many
 things
 when
 it


comes
 to
 industrial
 strategy.
 So
 we
 have


to
 be
 realistic
 of
 who
 we
 are
 dealing


with
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 haven't
 done


our
 homework.
 We
 have
 been
 complacent.


And
 so
 yes,
 can
 we
 have
 selective


engagement
 with
 China?
 Yes.
 Do
 we
 have


the
 tools
 right
 now?
 No.
 Can
 we
 develop


them
 if
 we
 actually
 put
 our
 minds
 to
 it?


Yes.
 But
 we
 have
 to
 have
 the
 kind
 of


conversations
 that
 you're
 initiating
 in


this
 room
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that.
 Because


in
 a
 democracy,
 it's
 not
 just
 our


political
 leaders,
 but
 people
 who
 also


need
 to
 participate.
 why
 we're
 here.
 I


think
 we're
 already
 doing
 some
 of
 that.


>> Yes.
 And
 and
 precisely


>> a
 working
 group.


>> So
 precisely
 the
 Asia-Pacific
 Foundation


and
 the
 work
 that
 you're
 doing
 and
 in


the
 region
 in
 particular
 as
 part
 of


Canada's
 Indopacific
 strategy
 is


intended
 to
 do
 that
 kind
 of
 work
 to


build
 those
 coalitions
 to
 actually
 do


the
 preparatory
 work.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 think


we're
 actually
 saying
 the
 same
 thing.
 I


absolutely
 think
 we
 can
 do
 it,
 but
 those


consent
 circles
 have
 to
 be
 have
 to
 be


drawn.
 We
 have
 to,
 you
 know,
 bring


Canadians
 along
 and
 educate
 Canadians.


We've
 got
 to
 be
 able
 to
 bring
 allies


along
 and
 educate
 and
 and
 collaborate.


>> I'm
 jumping
 in
 because
 this
 line's


getting
 long.
 Yeah.
 Because
 they
 want


in.
 Okay.
 If
 you
 wouldn't
 mind,
 uh,
 give


us
 your
 first
 name,
 perhaps
 where
 you're


from,
 and
 fire
 away
 with
 your
 question.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 Um,
 my
 name
 is
 JM.
 Uh,
 I'm
 a


international
 student
 at
 the
 University


of
 Toronto.
 And
 I
 love
 to
 talk
 about
 ru


democracy
 in
 Canada.
 And
 my
 sense
 is
 uh


there's
 something
 wrongs
 with
 the
 racial


hierarchy
 with
 the
 Chinese
 because
 when


we
 look
 at
 the
 track
 record
 of
 Chinese


in
 Canada,
 you
 have
 the
 the
 uh
 BC


construction
 workers,
 you
 have
 the


yellow
 peril,
 you
 have
 the
 Chinese
 hair


tax,
 Asian
 minority
 and
 the
 hatred


during
 the
 co.
 So
 if
 Canada
 is
 being
 a


quite
 a
 dictatorship
 to
 the
 Chinese


Canadians
 in
 this
 country
 like
 who
 is


Chinese
 who
 is
 Canadian
 government
 to


call
 Chinese
 government
 a
 dictatorship


to
 them
 because
 the
 freedom
 for
 Chinese


is
 pretty
 much
 the
 the
 dictatorship
 is


pretty
 much
 the
 same
 in
 these
 two


countries


>> do
 you
 know
 well
 okay
 that's
 your
 view


that's
 your
 view
 but
 we
 don't
 have


Chinese
 lawmakers
 in
 the
 parliament


lawyers
 journalists
 and
 all


I
 should
 also
 say
 apparently
 when
 our


when
 our
 political
 leaders
 go
 over
 to


China
 and
 and
 Bob
 Ray
 and
 I
 talked
 about


this
 just
 the
 other
 day,
 our
 former


ambassador
 to
 the
 United
 Nations,
 as


soon
 as
 he
 brings
 up
 human
 rights,
 the


Chinese
 say


your
 record
 on
 indigenous
 issues
 is


pretty
 terrible,
 too.
 And
 therefore,


you're
 in
 no
 position
 to
 lecture
 us.
 So,


>> where
 does
 that
 get
 us?


>> And
 therefore,
 we
 should
 talk
 about


maximizing
 interest
 instead
 of
 values.


But
 it's
 good
 to
 see
 one
 of
 our
 U
 of


students
 here.


>> Yeah.
 But
 there
 is
 no
 opportunities
 for


extra
 Chinese
 liberals
 to
 seek


opportunities
 in
 Canada.


>> But
 let
 me
 just
 say
 this.


>> I
 am
 a
 Chinese
 Canadian.
 I
 am
 one
 of
 1.8


million.
 I'm
 a
 proud
 Chinese
 Canadian.


I'm
 the
 first
 and
 only
 full
 Chinese


minister
 of
 the
 crown
 representing


Markham
 Thornhill
 writing
 but
 sitting


around
 a
 cabinet
 table
 and
 the
 longest


serving
 trade
 minister
 during
 co.
 We


stood
 up.
 the
 prime
 minister
 stood
 up
 to


call
 out
 the
 anti-Asian
 racism.
 And


you're
 right,
 um,
 for
 me,
 it
 was
 not


lost
 on
 me
 that
 on
 July
 the
 1st,
 a


couple
 of
 years
 ago,
 opening
 up
 the


Chinese
 Canadian
 Museum
 in
 Vancouver
 to


acknowledge
 an
 exclusion
 act
 where


someone
 like
 me,
 a
 sitting
 member
 of


Parliament,
 was
 complicit
 in
 creating
 a


law
 that
 prohibited
 people
 like
 me
 from


coming
 in
 the
 country.
 But
 it's
 about


recognizing
 and
 acknowledging
 um
 those


you
 know
 the
 faults
 of
 our
 past
 as
 we


have
 with
 indigenous
 reconciliation
 and


and
 and
 and
 the
 answer
 is
 absolutely


there's
 there's
 a
 lot
 that
 we're
 not
 a


proud
 that
 we're
 not
 proud
 of
 but
 what


have
 we
 done
 about
 Bob
 Ray
 says
 Bob
 Ray


says
 what
 will
 we
 continue
 to
 do
 and


look
 what
 we
 are


>> look
 what
 we're
 doing
 and
 look
 what


you're
 not
 doing
 and
 we
 don't
 silence


those
 who
 point
 that
 out


>> right
 okay
 next
 person


>> oh
 hi
 my
 name
 is
 Caroline
 I'm
 in
 finance


secretary.
 I'm
 very
 happy
 uh
 the
 issue


about
 China
 was
 brought
 up
 here
 and


that's
 very
 informed.
 Uh
 as
 a
 Chinese


Canadian
 uh
 China
 is
 very
 dear
 to
 me
 but


in
 the
 meantime
 I
 came
 to
 Canada
 for


freedom.
 When
 Mark
 Carney
 reopened
 the


dialogue
 with
 China,
 I'm
 very
 concerned


about,
 you
 know,
 if
 Canadian
 values
 will


be
 compromised
 because
 China
 leverage


the
 investment
 and
 trade
 to
 influence


Canadian
 uh
 business
 and
 public
 opinion


orchestra
 transnational
 repression
 uh


and
 a
 state
 sponsor
 cyber
 attack.
 Uh
 so


uh
 I
 I'd
 like
 to
 hear
 the
 answer
 from


the
 gentleman
 about
 how
 we
 can
 uh
 Canada


balance
 the
 relation
 between
 doing
 trade


with
 China
 in
 the
 meantime
 uh
 not
 compro


compromise
 Canadian
 values.
 Thank
 you


>> way.


>> Thanks.
 I
 fail
 to
 see
 how
 Canadian


values
 could
 be
 compromised
 by
 doing


more
 business
 with
 others
 whether
 it's


China,
 whether
 it's
 India.
 uh
 whether


it's
 the
 United
 States.
 So
 I
 don't
 think


Canadian
 values
 are
 that
 weak
 to
 be


compromised
 because
 we
 sell
 more
 or
 we


sell
 less.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a


characteristic
 of
 our
 country
 and


mercifully
 we're
 we're
 fine
 with
 it
 and


we
 continue
 to
 settle
 grievances
 and
 we


continue
 to
 fix
 problems.
 We
 could
 be


doing
 a
 better
 job.
 Of
 course
 you
 you're


raising
 issues
 that
 are
 issues
 of
 law.


So
 if
 there
 is
 coercion,
 if
 there
 is
 uh


illegal
 activity
 in
 this
 country,
 we


have
 the
 laws
 and
 the
 means
 to
 put
 an


end
 to
 it.
 We
 need
 to
 try
 harder.


There's
 no
 question
 about
 it.
 There's


spies.


>> Let
 me
 give
 let
 me
 give
 Vina
 a
 chance
 to


speak
 to
 this
 question,
 too.
 Do
 you


think
 if
 we
 do
 more
 business
 with
 these


countries,
 it
 threatens
 our
 values?


>> Well,
 it
 can
 make
 us
 vulnerable
 to


coercion
 and
 to
 compliance
 with
 lines
 of


argument
 that
 are
 not
 in
 our
 consistent


with
 our
 values.
 So
 I
 think
 it
 opens
 us


to
 that
 risk
 but
 we
 have
 to
 manage
 that.


So
 in
 other
 words
 when
 Constantine
 says


he
 can't
 imagine
 that
 world
 I
 mean
 we


have
 examples
 of
 what
 that
 looks
 like


right
 so
 because
 if
 basically
 China
 says


in
 order
 to
 have
 access
 to
 this
 market


you
 have
 to
 stop
 criticizing
 situations


of
 human
 rights
 or
 you
 have
 to
 stop


talking
 about
 foreign
 interference
 all


of
 those
 things
 if
 we
 were
 to
 comply


that
 would
 be
 compromising
 our
 values.


Now
 it
 opens
 it
 makes
 us
 more
 vulnerable


if
 we
 give
 them
 leverage
 but
 it
 doesn't


have
 to
 end
 up
 there.
 So
 there's
 a
 way


for
 us
 to
 manage
 both


>> and
 there's
 different
 ways
 to
 comp
 to


criticize.
 I
 mean
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 do


it
 from
 the
 rooftops.
 You
 can
 do
 it


behind
 closed
 doors.
 You
 can
 take
 the


cretian
 approach
 or
 you
 can
 take
 the


Trudeau
 approach.


>> Karan
 was
 dealing
 with
 a
 very
 different


China.
 So
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 can
 compare


what
 was
 happening
 in
 the
 90s
 and
 early


2000s
 with
 what's
 happening
 now.
 to
 my


point
 that
 China
 is
 much
 more
 powerful


now
 and
 demands
 a
 lot
 more
 compliance


from
 smaller
 countries
 like
 Canada.


>> But
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 there
 were
 issues


in
 China
 that
 Creten,
 at least
 as
 far
 as


he
 talks
 about
 it,
 criticized
 the


behind.


>> China
 was
 more
 open
 to
 that
 kind
 of


conversation
 then
 than
 it
 is
 now.


>> Let's
 get
 back
 to
 the
 audience
 here.


Julia,
 you're
 up.


>> Yes.
 Hi,
 I'm
 Julia
 Panella.
 I
 live
 in


Cabam.
 Um
 kind
 of
 continuing
 on
 the


theme
 of
 nostalgia
 as
 well
 as
 um
 labor


practices.
 Um,
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 how


Canada
 has
 long
 portrayed
 itself
 as
 a


peacekeeping
 nation,
 but
 I
 want
 to
 know,


do
 you
 think
 that
 this
 facade
 has
 faded?


We
 know
 in
 many
 of
 our
 supply
 chains,
 we


have
 fast
 fashion
 like
 Shien,
 um,


religious
 minorities
 that
 like
 the


weaguers
 who
 are
 under
 forced
 labor


practices
 and
 we're
 buying
 tomatoes
 from


them.
 The
 EU
 has
 taken
 some
 action


around
 this
 by
 taxing
 and
 and


investigating
 these
 practices.
 And
 more


recently,
 China
 is
 not
 the
 only
 country.


Canada
 also
 sold
 armored
 vehicles
 to


ISIS.
 So
 I
 want
 to
 know
 how
 can
 we
 as


Canadians
 claim
 ethical
 leadership
 while


trading
 with
 countries
 tied
 to
 human


rights
 abuses?


>> Anybody
 in
 particular
 you
 want
 on
 this?


>> Anybody?
 Go
 for
 it.


>> Lynette,
 go
 ahead.


>> We'll
 start
 with
 the
 I
 don't
 think
 any


country
 should
 stand
 on
 moral
 high


ground
 and
 say
 that
 we
 only
 do
 fair


trade
 because
 these
 things
 are
 very
 very


murky.
 The
 lines
 are
 very
 murky.
 Right.


the
 the
 examples
 that
 you
 have
 given
 you


know
 like
 you
 have
 to
 really
 have
 to


break
 down
 the
 ingredients
 of
 a
 shirt
 of


a
 blouse
 to
 see
 to
 say
 that
 where
 these


ingredients
 are
 actually
 source
 sourced


from
 it
 is
 very
 very
 difficult
 but
 on


the
 questions
 of
 vulnerability
 as
 as
 you


have
 mentioned
 and
 we
 discussed
 earlier


I
 think
 Canada
 by
 definition
 because
 of


the
 size
 of
 the
 Chinese
 diaspora
 which


I'm
 one
 of
 them
 I'm
 also
 a
 Chinese


Canadian
 is
 vulnerable
 to
 Chinese


political
 interference
 whether
 or
 not
 we


trade
 with
 China.
 I
 mean
 these
 are
 two


separate
 questions.
 Why
 are
 we
 inflating


them?
 Why
 are
 we
 conflating
 them?
 Right?


And
 if
 we
 do
 not
 trade
 with
 China,


there's
 another
 question
 that
 we
 have


not
 asked.
 How
 about
 our
 economic


prosperity?


Are
 we
 trading
 off
 certain
 things
 for


not
 trading
 with
 with
 China?
 Right?
 I


think
 we
 tend
 to
 conflate
 values
 with


interest
 and
 then
 economic
 interest
 and


political
 interest.
 Maybe
 we
 should


think
 about,
 you
 know,
 separate
 them.


>> Constantine.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 couldn't
 agree
 with
 that
 point


more.
 That
 was
 a
 excellent
 point
 of


conflating
 things
 that
 don't
 really
 come


together.
 Uh,
 and
 you
 know,
 bad
 stuff


could
 happen
 regardless
 of
 whether
 we're


trading
 with
 anybody
 or
 not.
 Um,
 but
 you


know,
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 trading
 with
 uh


countries
 that
 share
 our
 values,
 I'll


plagiarize
 and
 I'll
 quote
 uh
 John


Edmonson
 in
 the
 Globe
 who
 said
 if
 we


only
 traded
 with
 company
 with
 countries


that
 saw
 the
 world
 the
 way
 we
 see
 it


would
 be
 left
 with
 maybe
 Holland
 and


maybe
 Denmark
 and
 that's
 it.
 We
 wouldn't


trade
 with
 anybody.


>> And
 how
 boring?


>> It
 wouldn't
 be
 terribly
 profitable.
 But


so
 I
 think
 there
 need
 I
 think
 we
 need
 to


compartmentalize


trading
 and
 protecting
 uh
 the
 country


and
 the
 national
 interest
 and
 and
 the


rule
 of
 law.
 So
 um
 trading


as
 as
 the
 prime
 minister
 said
 um
 the
 old


way
 of
 doing
 things
 is
 dead.
 I
 mean
 we


need
 to
 do
 things
 differently
 and
 in


order
 to
 do
 things
 differently
 we
 need


to
 take
 many
 different
 approaches
 and


start
 trading
 with
 a


>> nobody's
 saying
 that
 we
 shouldn't
 trade


with
 China
 again
 it
 depends
 on
 what
 kind


of
 trade
 and
 it's
 not
 just
 about
 trade


it's
 also
 about
 investment
 it's
 about


deeper
 economic
 relations
 trade
 right


now
 is
 not
 just
 about
 trade
 there
 are


links
 to
 national
 security
 and
 economic


security
 and
 Lynette
 is
 right
 that
 our


vulnerability
 v
 foreign
 interference
 and


diaspora
 is
 of
 course
 baked
 in
 given
 the


composition
 of
 Canadian
 society
 But
 we


also
 have
 other
 potential


vulnerabilities
 if
 we
 become


strategically
 dependent
 on
 China
 in


certain
 sectors.
 So
 you
 can
 still
 become


more
 vulnerable.
 Just
 because
 a
 certain


level
 of
 vulnerability
 is
 baked
 in


doesn't
 mean
 that
 oh
 well
 then
 in
 that


case
 it
 doesn't
 matter
 what
 else
 we
 do.


So
 I
 think
 again
 multiple
 things
 can
 be


true
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 Yes,
 we
 have
 to


do
 some
 trade
 with
 China.
 China
 is
 an


important
 consequential
 economic
 power.


We
 cannot
 ignore
 and
 we
 have
 to
 be


cleareyed
 about
 the
 kind
 of
 strategic


dependencies,
 the
 kind
 of
 risks
 that


come
 with
 greater
 engagement
 given
 that


trade
 now
 is
 intrinsically
 linked
 to


national
 security
 and
 economic
 security.


We're
 not
 living
 in
 a
 world
 where


politics,
 trade,
 diplomacy
 are
 separate


lanes.


>> Let's
 go
 back
 to
 the
 audience.
 Yes
 sir.


>> Hello.
 Um
 my
 name
 is
 Nicholas
 uh
 former


University
 of
 Waterl
 student.
 Um
 my


question
 is
 to
 the
 entire
 panel
 which
 is


uh
 given
 that
 the
 Chinese
 and
 American


relationship
 will
 likely
 be
 the
 defining


relationship
 of
 the
 21st
 century.
 What


um
 particular
 policies
 or
 countries
 can


we
 look
 at
 that
 are
 that
 could
 serve
 us


as
 a
 template
 on
 navigating
 this


relationship?
 For
 example,
 Singapore


under
 Lie
 Kuanu.


>> Mary,
 you
 want
 to
 take
 that
 on?
 Yeah,
 I


mean
 um
 I
 think
 that
 uh
 that
 what
 the


world
 is
 experiencing
 right
 now
 in
 the


great
 power
 competition
 is
 something


that
 that
 we
 have
 not
 experienced
 or


seen.
 I
 don't
 know
 necessarily
 that


there
 is
 any
 country
 that
 uh
 that
 has


figured
 this
 out.
 I
 think
 we're
 all
 in


this
 boat
 together
 and
 I
 think
 I
 go
 back


to
 what
 is
 it
 that
 we
 need
 to
 do
 as


Canada
 as
 a
 country?
 What
 is
 in
 our


interest?
 What
 kind
 of
 economy
 do
 we


want
 uh
 down
 the
 road?
 What
 stands
 in


the
 way
 of
 our
 economy
 getting
 there?


Who
 should
 we
 be
 partnering
 with?
 How
 do


we
 deepen
 those
 relationships
 in
 such
 a


way
 that
 actually
 is
 inherently
 good
 for


Canadian
 resiliency,
 for
 our
 economy
 in


the
 future,
 for
 jobs
 for
 our
 workers,


for
 us
 to
 be
 able
 to
 innovate,
 for
 us
 to


compete,
 uh,
 and
 with
 whom?
 I
 mean,
 so
 I


think
 that
 th
 those
 are
 the
 questions


that
 that
 we
 as
 Canadians
 should
 be
 very


cleareyed
 and
 very
 very
 focused
 on
 and


getting
 ourselves
 on
 a
 path
 of


accomplishing
 that
 over
 the
 next,
 you


know,
 over
 the
 next
 number
 of
 years
 and


decades
 so
 that
 Canada
 continues
 to
 have


the
 standard
 of
 living
 that
 we
 want
 that


continues
 to
 attract
 the
 people
 that
 we


do
 that
 has
 the
 freedoms
 and
 the
 democra


and
 and and
 and
 and
 living
 within,
 you


know,
 within
 the
 democratic
 system
 that


we
 have
 enjoyed.


uh
 and
 that
 we
 will
 continue
 to
 enjoy.
 I


think
 that's
 up
 to
 us
 to
 figure
 out
 and


and
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 anyone
 else
 has


has
 has
 actually
 got
 a
 secret
 sauce.


>> Thanks
 for
 the
 question,
 Nicholas.
 Let's


get
 the
 next
 person
 in
 line,
 please.


>> Hi,
 good
 evening.
 Uh
 my
 name
 is
 Elliot


Chen.
 I'm
 a
 reporter
 with
 The
 Wire


China.
 I
 think
 I've
 spoken
 to
 some
 of


you
 before.
 It's
 it's
 nice
 to
 see
 you


again.


>> Um
 my
 question
 is
 about
 the
 trade


balance.
 Um
 as
 as
 as
 you
 know,
 you
 know,


China
 spent
 the
 last
 decade
 spending


hundreds
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars
 trying


to
 achieve
 self-sufficiency.
 uh


particularly
 in
 high-tech
 sectors,
 you


know,
 everything
 from
 semiconductors
 to


EVs
 to
 even
 food.
 Um
 you
 know,
 there


there's
 a
 world
 in
 which
 China
 would


like
 to
 be
 self-sufficient
 in
 all
 these


things
 and
 not
 be
 dependent
 on
 importing


from
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world.
 And
 so
 I


guess
 my
 question
 is
 for
 the
 you
 know


the
 members
 of
 the
 panel
 that
 are
 more


supportive
 of
 of
 a
 pivot
 uh
 perhaps
 Mr.


to
 carryonopoulos.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 how
 do


you
 build
 a
 sustainable
 trading


relationship
 when
 one
 country
 wants
 to


sell,
 you
 know,
 everything
 from
 timu


goods
 to
 chips
 to
 EVs
 and
 the
 other


country
 is
 primarily
 offering
 canola
 and


fish.


Um,


yeah,
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 easy,
 but
 we


we
 talked
 a
 little
 bit
 earlier
 about
 um


we
 mentioned
 rather
 an
 industrial


strategy.
 Um
 I
 think
 part
 of
 one
 of
 the


many
 reasons
 why
 North
 America
 and


Europe
 developed
 the
 way
 they
 did
 in
 the


postc
 world
 war
 period
 is
 the
 existence


of
 industrial
 strategies
 um
 in
 in
 Canada


at least
 in
 the
 last
 uh
 few
 decades


around
 the
 automotive
 industry.
 Well


perhaps
 not
 so
 much
 in
 Canada
 but
 in


Ontario
 and
 Quebec.
 Um
 I
 think
 we
 need


to
 rethink
 of
 what
 we
 need
 to
 do
 as
 a


country
 and
 where
 we
 need
 to
 be
 in
 5
 10


20
 years.


>> And
 um
 you
 know
 I'm
 not
 only
 saying
 that


because
 that's
 what
 China
 does,
 but
 I've


had
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 front
 row
 seat.
 I
 mean


2011
 the
 12
 five-year
 plan
 China


identified
 eight
 strategic
 emerging


industries
 most
 around
 decarbonization


and
 the
 energy
 transition
 that
 they
 were


absolutely
 dead
 set
 on
 dominating
 using


them
 to
 drive
 yes
 using
 them
 to
 drive


their
 industrial
 expansion
 and
 at
 the


same
 time
 perhaps
 with
 the
 13
 five-year


plan
 they
 determined
 that
 needed
 to
 be


self-sufficient
 in
 critical
 minerals
 and


they
 set
 out
 to
 own
 critical
 mineral


assets
 around
 the
 world.
 We
 need
 to


think
 about
 what
 we
 need
 to
 do.
 When
 we


were
 talking
 earlier
 about
 digging


critical
 minerals
 out
 of
 the
 ground,
 I


think
 we
 need
 to
 be
 thinking
 of
 adding


value
 here
 in
 order
 to
 feed
 the
 EV


industry
 that
 we've
 been
 so
 generously


funding


>> because
 if
 we
 don't,
 the
 lithium
 is


going
 to
 come
 from
 either
 China
 or
 Chile


or
 Argentina.
 The
 magnets
 will
 come
 from


China
 or
 Europe.
 the
 plant
 that
 perhaps


I
 built
 in
 uh
 Estonia.
 But
 we
 need
 to


keep
 looking
 at
 what
 we
 can
 do
 here.
 We


have
 fantastic
 universities.
 I'm
 a
 I'm
 a


chemical
 engineer
 from
 uft,
 so
 I'm
 I'm


I'm
 biased.
 We
 have
 fantastic


educational
 institutions,
 but
 we're
 not


using
 them
 to
 the
 degree
 that
 we
 should


be.


>> Let
 me
 jump
 in
 for
 a
 second
 here.


>> We've
 come
 full
 circle
 and
 we
 actually


agree,
 which
 is
 great.


>> There
 we
 go.
 There
 we
 go.
 Stand
 by
 one


second.
 Uh
 let
 me
 just
 do
 a
 time
 check


here.
 Hillary,
 how
 much
 how
 many
 more


questions
 we
 got
 time
 for?


>> I
 think
 we're
 at
 time.


>> We
 got
 two
 questions
 more.
 That's
 all
 we


got
 time
 because
 they're
 going
 to
 kick


us
 out
 of
 the
 hall
 soon.
 So,
 you
 with


the
 glasses
 and
 the
 person
 behind
 you.


And
 forgive
 me,
 that's
 all
 the
 time
 we


got.


>> Um,
 so
 go
 ahead,
 sir.


>> Yes.
 This
 question
 is
 for
 the
 panel.
 My


name's
 Nick.
 I'm
 from
 Cork
 Town.
 um


thinking
 about
 the
 40
 plus
 million


citizens
 of
 this
 country
 that
 are
 you


know
 from
 none
 of
 it
 to
 eastern
 Canada


to
 western
 Canada
 the
 panel
 did


highlight
 the
 need
 for
 high
 value
 jobs


so
 what
 specific
 sectors
 should
 Canada


prioritize
 to
 ensure
 variable
 geometry


trade
 which
 you
 guys
 mentioned


>> actually
 delivers
 those
 jobs
 rather
 than


hollowing
 those
 jobs
 out


>> okay
 which
 sectors
 should
 we
 focus
 on


who
 wants
 that
 Lynette
 you
 want
 to
 go


for
 that


>> I
 think
 we
 should
 focus
 on
 those
 sectors


where
 our
 comparative
 comparative


advantage
 wise
 um
 I
 am
 thinking
 about


agricultural
 processing
 high
 end
 of
 of


of
 agricultural
 processing
 and
 services


sector
 um
 I
 would
 be
 wary
 about
 you
 know


building
 factories
 um
 doing
 industrial


policy
 in
 large
 scales
 in
 those
 sectors


we
 clearly
 do
 not
 have
 an
 uh
 comparative


advantages
 because
 um
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day
 it
 is
 going
 to
 be
 very
 costly
 for


the
 economy
 in
 with
 hidden
 costs
 that
 uh


taxpayers
 will
 have
 to
 suffer
 and
 they


don't
 and
 they
 don't
 get
 political


voices
 uh
 to
 be
 heard.


>> Vina,
 quick
 hit.
 I


>> I
 think
 one
 thing
 that
 we
 can
 do
 is
 we


can
 connect
 some
 of
 the
 excellence
 that


we
 have
 in
 AI
 and
 robotics
 and
 quantum


in
 aerospace
 with
 our
 industry.
 So


really
 connect
 that
 research
 with


industry
 where
 I
 think
 we
 can
 actually


move
 forward
 and
 we
 can
 use
 the
 billions


of
 dollars
 that
 are
 now
 being
 promised


for
 defense
 spending
 for
 those
 kinds
 of


dual
 use
 technologies
 around
 spy
 cyber


around
 quantum
 around
 AI
 which
 I
 think


could
 really
 position
 us
 well
 both
 for


our
 economic
 needs
 as
 well
 as
 our


defense
 needs
 and
 meet
 the
 various


targets
 that
 we've
 put
 in
 place
 to
 be


good
 ally.
 I
 would
 also
 add
 clean
 energy


particularly
 around
 nuclear
 where
 we
 are


an
 absolute
 powerhouse
 and
 we've
 got


great
 technology
 and
 you
 add
 and
 you
 add


AI
 into
 that
 and
 we
 actually
 um
 it's


it's
 really
 a
 great


>> small
 modular
 reactors


>> and
 the
 big
 ones
 too
 I
 can
 do
 I
 mean


>> we've
 been
 waiting
 all
 night
 long
 to
 get


to
 your
 question


>> you
 are
 the
 last
 one
 go
 for
 it


>> Zach
 from
 University
 of
 Wateroo
 and
 my


question
 is
 to
 the
 minister
 is
 do
 we


think
 a
 pivot
 to
 China
 would
 be
 costfree


because
 the
 US
 could
 easily
 retaliate


and
 given
 the
 comparison
 even
 Mexico
 is


retaliating
 on
 China
 and
 putting
 tariffs


on
 them
 to
 please
 the
 US.
 So
 do
 we
 think


it's
 worth
 the
 juice
 to
 try
 to
 pivot


given
 the
 huge
 gaps?


>> I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a
 pivot.
 I
 think
 it


is
 what
 we
 all
 said
 what
 the
 variety
 of


us
 said
 that
 we
 need
 to
 that
 we


shouldn't
 ignore
 the
 second
 largest


economy
 in
 the
 world
 and
 that
 there
 are


interests
 for
 Canada
 to
 uh
 to
 expand
 and


to
 do
 more
 in.
 So
 I
 think
 about
 tourism,


I
 think
 about
 agra
 foods,
 I
 think
 about


uh
 you
 know
 I


right
 I
 mean
 energy
 right
 I
 mean
 like
 so


I
 so
 there
 are
 this
 is
 where
 we
 do
 that


and
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 we
 also
 then
 think


about
 who
 else
 we
 do
 more
 trade
 with
 I


mean
 around
 the
 world
 who
 are
 our


partners
 or
 who
 should
 be
 better
 you


know
 who
 should
 be
 deeper
 partners
 so
 I


don't
 think
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a


straight
 pivot
 I
 think
 it's
 I
 think
 you


can
 walk
 and
 chew
 gum
 at
 the
 same
 time


>> the
 idea
 that
 the
 white
 house
 needs
 any


rational
 reason
 to
 retaliate
 is
 a
 little


bit


stretched
 a
 fair.


>> That's
 a
 fair
 point.
 Should
 we
 do
 the


vote
 one
 more
 time
 just
 for
 the
 heck
 of


it
 and
 see
 if
 anybody's
 changed
 their


mind
 here?
 How
 many
 people
 are,
 you


know,
 in
 light
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 with


the
 United
 States,
 we
 should
 do
 a
 pivot


to
 China.
 Let's
 dive
 in
 deeper.
 Hands


up,
 please.


And
 hands
 down.
 Absolutely
 not.
 We
 don't


share
 their
 same
 values,
 yada
 yada
 yada.


Hands
 up.


>> Oh,
 I
 think
 the
 first
 group
 got
 bigger


and
 I
 think
 the
 second
 group
 got


smaller.
 It's
 about
 the
 same
 about
 the


same.


>> I
 think
 that
 that's
 my
 impression
 here


anyway.
 Anyway,
 okay,
 that
 is
 our
 time


and
 we're
 going to
 do
 a
 few
 thank
 yous


here
 before
 we
 leave
 this
 evening.
 First


of
 all,
 I
 really
 want
 to
 thank
 all
 of


you
 for
 coming
 out
 this
 evening.
 Um


people


uh


outside
 this
 hall,
 people
 may
 or
 if


you're
 watching
 on
 television
 may
 not


know
 it's
 miserable
 in
 Toronto
 tonight.


Now,
 I
 know
 people
 in
 North
 Bay
 and


Sbury
 and
 Thunder
 Bay
 are
 thinking,


"You're
 a
 bunch
 of
 whiners.
 It's
 always


cold
 where
 we
 are."
 But
 it's
 miserable


out
 there
 tonight,
 and
 you
 folks
 filled


the
 hole.
 So,
 thank
 you
 for
 coming
 out.


We're
 very
 grateful.
 To
 our
 crew,
 as


always,
 Mark
 Ford,
 Chad
 Castle,
 Sheldon


Osman,
 we're
 grateful
 for
 the
 work
 you


did
 to
 make
 this
 look
 as
 good
 as
 it
 did


tonight.
 Uh
 to
 the
 folks
 who
 are
 with


the
 St.
 Lawrence
 Hall,
 Alex
 Naylor,
 and


his
 team,
 great
 working
 with
 you
 to
 make


all
 of
 this
 happen.
 Hillary
 Clark,
 who


produces
 TVO
 Today
 Live,
 you
 are
 the


bomb,
 kiddo.
 Well
 done.
 And
 as
 always
 to


the
 Wilson
 Foundation
 and
 its
 benefactor


Red
 Wilson
 for
 enabling
 this
 to
 happen.


Everybody's
 here
 tonight
 free
 of
 charge.


Nobody
 paid
 anything
 to
 come
 in
 tonight


because
 Red
 Wilson
 subsidizes
 this
 whole


thing.
 So
 thanks
 a
 lot
 Red
 Wilson
 for


your
 support
 of
 this.

 join
 me
 in
 thanking
 these
 four
 for
 a


sublime
 discussion

Lawrence
 Hall.
