- In the summer of 1841,
Florida Doctor John Gorrie
faced a dire situation.
Yellow fever, also known
as the black vomit,
was sweeping through his town,
wiping out entire families.
Patients came to Gorrie's small infirmary,
jaundiced and burning with
fevers up to 40 degrees Celsius.
To cool his patients down,
Gorrie couldn't turn to refrigeration
because that hadn't been invented yet.
So, he came up with a radical treatment.
He suspended pans of ice in his infirmary,
allowing the cool, dense air
to flow down over his patients,
providing much-needed relief.
(patient exhaling)
But, this treatment was
almost impossible to sustain
because it required hundreds
of kilograms of ice per day,
and Gorrie had only one way to get it.
(ice scraping)
(train engine whirring)
(ice block thudding)
He relied on ice blocks
that were transported
thousands of kilometers
through a now-forgotten ice empire,
a vast network of ships and ice houses
all built and controlled by one man.
(suspenseful music)
Known to the world as the Ice King.
(upbeat music)
Over the previous 35 years,
he had forged a monopoly
that spanned the globe,
and anyone who wanted
ice was at his mercy.
(upbeat music)
Gorrie only got a
few deliveries each year,
and now, by the peak of summer,
the cost of just a few
days' ice for the infirmary
would've been more expensive
than the average yearly wage.
So, locals began to refer
to the ice as white gold.
As Gorrie's supply ran out,
he was forced to watch his
patients suffer and die.
It was in that moment that he
decided he would find a way
to free the world from
the grip of the Ice King.
By the turn of the 19th century,
most of America's ice came
from the northern states,
where thousands of square
kilometers of lakes
would freeze over for much of the year.
The hard part was
getting all that ice out.
- To get ice out of a lake or river,
first of all, you had to
trust that it was deep enough
to support your weight,
and there's no way to really tell.
Then, you had to walk out several feet
onto this plane of ice,
take a saw, that's as long as I am tall,
and then carve the very
ice that you're standing on
and just hope to heaven
that it doesn't sink.
(bright music)
Then, you had to kind
of float it to shore,
and a horse would help
to kind of pull the ice
into the back of a wagon.
It was frequently common
for the harvesters and their horses
to fall through into the ice,
sometimes to their death.
- This dangerous and painstaking process
meant that ice remained a rare commodity,
available mostly to wealthy landowners.
One of the few who had access to it
was 22-year-old Boston
merchant Frederic Tudor.
In the winter of 1805,
Tudor was thinking back
to a tragic incident
that had happened four years earlier.
He and his brother came
down with a bad fever
while visiting the Caribbean.
Back home, they would've
just asked their servants
to get some ice.
But on the islands, ice was unheard of.
With no way to cool down,
the brothers cut their trip
short and returned to America.
And while Frederic recovered,
his brother did not.
(pensive music)
Today, we know
that ice wouldn't have
saved his brother's life
because he likely
suffered from a rare case
of bone tuberculosis.
But at the time,
Tudor believed that it was
the lack of ice on the islands
that was responsible
for his brother's death.
It was this painful memory
that gave him an idea.
What if he could be the one
to bring ice to the Caribbean?
And, in the process, make his fortune.
So, Tudor got to work.
He hired dozens of men to gather ice
and approached investors
to help finance a ship.
But to the investors, this
plan seemed ridiculous.
Tudor wrote, "People only laugh
when I tell them I'm going to
carry ice to the West Indies,"
which is understandable
because the journey
would take three weeks,
sailing through warm seas under
the blazing Caribbean sun.
I mean, can you really transport ice
in those conditions for that long?
Wouldn't it all just melt?
It turns, out people had figured out ways
to make ice last a long time,
even thousands of years ago.
As far back as 500 BC,
in the scorching summers
of the Persian Empire,
ancient kings, like Xerxes,
enjoyed refreshing frozen desserts,
even when the outside temperature
climbed as high as 35 degrees Celsius.
Now, ice in the desert might seem strange,
but during the winter months,
temperatures can drop dramatically.
So, the Persians filled
shallow pools with water,
which would freeze overnight,
and in the morning,
they would break up the ice
sheets and collect the pieces.
To make that ice last until the summer,
they used three key techniques.
- Let's try simple a experiment.
I have eight ice cubes spread
evenly in one dish here
and I have another eight ice cubes
now stacked together in one mega cube
in this dish over here.
Now, if you leave these two
plates to melt for a few hours,
the stacked ice cubes fare a lot better,
and that's because the main way ice melts
is through heat conduction on its surface.
So, even though the volume was the same,
the surface area exposed here
is double what we had here.
The key idea here is that
you wanna pack your ice
as tightly as possible.
- [Derek] In fact, the best shape
to minimize the surface area is a sphere.
So, if you think about it,
a snowman is pretty much
mathematically optimal to survive
as long as possible.
But, you don't need perfect geometry
to make ice last a long time.
In the winter of 2010,
the city of Helsinki dumped all the snow
plowed from their streets
onto this huge pile,
around 30 meters high and 100 meters wide.
Almost a year later,
that very same pile was still around,
despite being exposed
to one of the country's
hottest summers in decades.
(jaunty music)
The main reason it lasted so long
is because the ratio of
surface area to volume
actually decreases for larger
and larger amounts of ice.
For example, if you double
the radius of this snowman,
then the volume of ice
increases by a factor
of two cubed or eight,
but the surface area
only increases by a factor
of two squared or four.
This is known as the square cube law,
which was the second technique
used by the Persians.
And finally, they needed a way
to shield the ice from the harsh desert.
(jaunty music)
- Okay, I have another example.
Two ice cubes, two dishes.
The only difference, really,
is gonna be that I have this fan,
which is gonna be blowing
air onto this ice cube.
Now, it's not heating any of the air,
it's just blowing away any air
the ice would've chilled for itself.
And it's introducing more
warmer, ambient-temperature air,
which heats the ice cube better.
(pensive music)
After about an hour of the fan blowing,
this ice cube is completely gone,
whereas this one is only about 40% melted.
So, obviously, you wanna
minimize the amount of airflow
that you're getting around your ice.
One way you can do that
is by putting the ice in
a deeper dish, like a pit,
because colder air sinks to the bottom,
so it collects around the ice
and lets it stay there for longer.
And a way you can one-up
that is to seal the ice,
which is exactly what the Persians did.
- [Derek] This is a yakhchal,
an ancient Persian ice house.
It's a massive dome structure
with walls up to two
meters thick at the base.
Here, the Persians collected
up to 220 tonnes of ice
and packed it tightly together in a pit.
This allowed the cold,
dense air to collect
while warm air was funneled
up and out of the dome.
After the winter,
the entire structure was sealed up,
insulating the ice until summer.
(compelling music)
For the next 2,300 years, these
techniques barely changed.
And now, Tudor was
ready to bet his fortune
on these ancient principles.
So, he mortgaged land on his
family estate to buy a ship,
and he began modifying it
for the long journey to the West Indies.
- He did that by building
out a cargo hole in a ship
that was built similarly
to the ice houses.
The ice was elevated off the ground,
so it wasn't sitting in melt water
because melt water speeds
up the melting of ice.
And the blocks of ice were
also packed really tightly.
- Tudor went all in,
sinking a full $10,000
of mostly borrowed money
into the venture,
which is the equivalent of
over a quarter million dollars today.
He sent his youngest brother
and his cousin ahead to
the island of Martinique
to build an ice house
ready to receive the cargo.
On the morning of February 13th, 1806,
Tudor departed Boston Harbor,
carrying with him over
80 metric tonnes of ice,
the first shipment of its kind.
The Boston Gazette ran an
article that read, "No joke.
A vessel has cleared at the Custom House
with a cargo of ice.
We hope this will not prove
a slippery speculation."
After nearly three weeks at
sea, Tudor's ship arrived,
and to his relief,
around half of the ice
had survived the trip.
But there was a problem.
His brother and cousin had
failed to build an ice house.
(suspenseful music)
So, with no place to store the ice,
Tudor had to sell it
straight off the dock,
under the hot sun.
He sold as quickly as possible,
but after two days, he
had only made about $50.
The locals were confused by
the strange frozen water,
and many were shocked
when their new product
disappeared before their eyes.
One customer tried to
save his precious ice
by submerging it in a bath of water,
only to find it vanishing even faster.
In the end,
all Tudor could do was watch
his remaining ice melt away.
Yet somehow, he was undeterred,
and over the next four years,
he continued to borrow money,
using every cent to
ship ice to new markets,
like Cuba, Jamaica, Barbados, and Antigua.
But, business remained difficult.
Tudor wrote, "I found myself without money
and without friends,
and with only a cargo of ice
in a torrid zone to depend on
for the supply of both."
By 1809, Tudor owed $40,000 to investors,
which is over 1 million bucks today.
He was hounded by creditors,
he was forced to hide from
sheriffs on his own ships,
and he was even sent to
debtor's prison twice.
(jail bars clanging)
He later described it as,
"The winter of my discontent,"
but during that time, he had a revelation.
The reason demand wasn't picking up
was because the people of the West Indies
didn't know what to do with ice.
So, all he had to do, he reasoned,
was make them understand
by offering them some refreshing drinks.
(beverage sloshing)
- He convinces the bartenders there
to let him show them how
to make icy cocktails,
and he gives the ice initially
to the bartenders for free.
So, the bartenders can
sell both the icy drink
and the room temperature
drink at the same price,
just to see what their customers prefer.
And lo and behold, they
prefer the icy drink.
- [Derek] In Tudor's own words,
"A man who has drank his drinks cold
at the same expense for one week
can never be presented
with them warm again."
- Tudor even showed them
how to make ice cream,
which became an instant
hit, especially in Cuba.
150 years later, during
the Cuban Revolution,
its leader, Fidel Castro,
was obsessed with ice cream.
He was actually known
to eat up to 18 scoops after lunchtime,
which is a bit crazy.
His sweet tooth was so famous
that the CIA actually
tried to assassinate him
with a poisoned milkshake.
Now, back in Tudor's day, his
work was finally paying off.
The cafe owners in the West Indies
started asking him for more and more ice,
and he realized that he
could increase his profits,
just by refining his methods.
So, he started using sawdust
to insulate his ice on the ships
because sawdust was a phenomenal insulator
that you could basically get for free
from all the sawmills around Boston.
They were just trying to get rid of it.
And he also replaced the
manual saws at the lakes
with horse-drawn plows,
which made it all the
easier to get the ice out.
Because of that,
the price of extracting a tonne of ice
dropped from around 30 cents
all the way down to 10 cents.
- By the 1820s, Tudor was
finally turning a profit,
and the ice trade began to pick up.
So much so that copycat
businesses began to crop up.
But Tudor wasn't about to let anyone else
have a share of the market he created.
So, to maintain his monopoly,
he often undercut his competition
until they either gave up
or went out of business.
Tudor's ambition didn't end
there, and he wrote that,
There was "an experiment I
have been desirous of making
for 20 years."
In 1833, he took on his
biggest challenge yet,
a four-month journey
to ship ice halfway across
the world to Calcutta, India.
(suspenseful music)
(rain splashing)
(thunder rumbling)
(waves crashing)
(wind whooshing)
(waves crashing)
And despite the trip
being five times longer
than his first one to the Caribbean,
more than half of the ice survived.
(compelling music)
In India, the ice was a big hit.
Over the next 20 years,
Tudor made around $220,000
in Calcutta alone,
making it one of his
most profitable ventures.
Over that same period, he
rapidly expanded his empire,
opening roots to Brazil,
Singapore, Hong Kong,
and even Australia.
His yearly sales
went from less than
10,000 tonnes in the 1830s
to a record high of 132,000 tonnes in 1856.
Seeing the wealth and
power of his monopoly,
the world gave Tudor a new name:
the Ice King.
(suspenseful music)
(ice cracking)
In under 50 years,
the ice trade had become one
of the largest industries
in the US,
and it's second largest export by weight.
What was once a luxury
product became a commodity.
By the 1860s, devices known as ice boxes
started popping up in ordinary kitchens.
Essentially, they were
insulated wooden cabinets
with a compartment for ice at the top,
which would then cool
down the food underneath,
keeping it fresh.
Families across the country
soon bought ice daily or weekly,
with the average New Yorker
buying over 600 kilograms a year.
This surge in demand resulted
in a curious new profession.
The iceman.
The iceman would go door to door,
delivering huge blocks of
ice up to 45 kilograms.
And while home delivery was
nothing new in the 19th century,
the iceman was unique,
in that he needed to go inside your house
to make his delivery.
- [Homeowner] Yoo-hoo!
Iceman!
- All kinds of rumors and jokes
and cultural thoughts
started to to crop up.
And if you look at
some of the most popular
songs at the time,
"She Fell In Love with the Iceman,"
or "The Iceman Took My Wife."
If you look at old Valentine's Day cards
that were circulating at this time,
they all had puns about the iceman.
The iceman made my wife too hot;
he was supposed to deliver ice.
Like, it was so silly.
(jaunty music)
- Consumption of ice
in big cities like New York skyrocketed.
And by the end of the 19th century,
ice had grown into a
billion-dollar business.
And while part of the demand
was due to home ice boxes,
the real driving force was
several new industries.
- The ice industry also
launched the fish industry,
the meat packing industry,
the brewery industry.
It became like this multi-level industry.
(train horn honking)
When we get to the point
where there are railroads,
then comes the invention
of the refrigeration car,
railroad cars that were
insulated with ice blocks
to carry things that are perishable.
- So, if you think about it,
fresh fruits and vegetables
that have been region-locked
now can become national staples.
So, you have apricots and
cherries from California,
you have strawberries from
Florida, they can all go inland.
Actually, you want to guess
the name of a vegetable
that was really popularized
with these chilled cars?
- Chilled vegetable.
I'm gonna guess lettuce?
- Which one?
- Iceberg.
It's gotta be iceberg, right?
- [Gregor] Exactly.
- It's like crunchy water.
It's like ice, iceberg lettuce.
- [Gregor] It is crunchy water,
but it was actually called iceberg
because of the ice that kept it fresh.
(jaunty music)
- This change marked the
beginning of a new system
called the cold chain.
And for the meat packing
industry, it was a huge upgrade.
Previously, the only way
to transport fresh meat
was by sending rail cars
filled with live cattle
straight from farms to cities.
Then, the animals had to
be brought into the city
and held in local stockyards
before they were prepared
by local slaughterhouses and butchers.
The result was that city centers
were filled with dirty, noisy cows.
And on top of that,
since almost half of
the animal was inedible,
shipping was extremely
inefficient, pushing up the cost.
(jaunty music)
But, with chilled rail
cars, all this changed,
and the country's supply chain
reorganized into three parts.
First, ranches across the Great Plains
funneled their cattle to
cities in the Midwest.
Taking on the role
of industrial food
preparation and distribution,
these cities built up vast
stockyards, slaughterhouses,
and rail hubs to send the meat onward.
Chicago emerged as the
nation's meat packing capital,
ballooning in size from
just 30,000 people in 1850
to 1.7 million in 1900.
And at the end of the chain
were the large, insatiable cities.
With the new system in place,
almost twice as much edible meat
could be transported in each rail car,
eventually dropping the
cost in urban areas by 39%.
As a result, demand soared.
In New York City alone,
beef shipments rose from
just 2,400 tonnes in 1882
to around 63,000 tons in 1886.
That's a 25-fold increase
in just four years.
But more importantly,
with a national distribution
network to rely on,
these cities no longer needed
to prepare meat locally.
They could finally get rid
of all the infrastructure
and herds of cows in the city center,
freeing up the land
for things like housing,
offices, and factories.
This fundamentally changed their structure
and gave rise to the modern city of today.
(suspenseful music)
But, while the cold chain
was redefining America,
a new invention
was about to overthrow
the natural ice industry,
which brings us back to Dr.
John Gorrie in the 1840s.
A few scientists had devised
and even built prototype cooling machines,
but they weren't commercially viable.
And Gorrie wasn't faring any better.
He had spent three years
struggling to make artificial ice
with no success.
But one night,
while experimenting with an
air pump to drain a bucket,
he noticed that if you let
the air expand quickly,
it formed a thin layer of ice
on the surface of the water.
He had just stumbled upon
the breakthrough he needed,
and he set about creating a
prototype based on this idea.
Take a sealed cylinder filled with air
and a piston that can move inside it.
We'll assume there's no friction
or heat lost to the environment.
When the piston pushes
down, the air is compressed,
increasing its pressure and temperature.
The reason the temperature increases
is because as the piston pushes down,
it moves toward the air molecules.
So, when a molecule bounces
off this moving surface,
it gains a little bit of speed.
And since the temperature
is proportional to the
molecules speed squared,
well, the air must heat up.
But, notice that this process
is completely reversible.
If the piston is released,
the high pressure air
pushes the piston back
until the pressure equalizes.
So now, when one of the
molecules bounces off the piston,
it loses a little bit of speed.
Gorrie knew that if he simply let
all of this hot, high-pressure air expand,
it would return back to roughly
its original temperature,
which wouldn't be very helpful.
But what if he first cooled
the air and then let it expand?
Well, then, its temperature
would drop far lower
than the ambient air.
He started with a similar setup,
a cylinder and a piston that
were powered by a hand crank,
which he then attached
to a large air tank.
As Gorrie turned the crank,
the piston moved down,
compressing the air and
raising its temperature.
To prevent the air from being
sucked out of the large tank,
Gorrie added a one-way valve
at the bottom of the cylinder.
He also added a similar valve
at the top of the piston,
so that the cylinder could
refill with fresh air.
So, now, with each turn of the crank,
more and more air was added to the tank,
which allowed to increase the pressure
to around 10 atmospheres.
But then, he added one extra step.
In between the piston and the tank,
he placed a big bucket of water
and he forced the air
through a submerged pipe.
This cooled the air down
to around the same
temperature as the water.
The result was that his tank
was still filled with high-pressure air,
but instead of being hot, it was cool.
So, now, when Gorrie
released some of his cool air
into another cylinder with a piston,
the air rapidly expanded.
This cooled the air down
below its starting point
and dropped it to freezing temperatures.
Gorrie then placed this entire cylinder
inside a large tank of water,
finally making ice.
But to avoid the entire
tank freezing solid
and clogging up his machine,
he used one final trick.
Instead of fresh water,
he filled the final tank with salt water,
which freezes below zero degrees Celsius.
Since the salt water remained liquid,
he then submerged metal
molds of fresh water
until they froze into solid blocks,
essentially creating the
world's first ice cube tray.
For the first time ever, ice
could be created anywhere,
even in the heat of the Florida summer.
(pensive music)
- And when he says to the world
like, "I've invented ice,"
the reaction was, "The hell you have.
(Amy laughing)
No man should be creating ice.
Only God can create ice."
And what John Gorrie also didn't realize
is that in the first public venues
in which he announces his ice machine,
Frederic Tudor has his
associates in the audience.
And Frederic Tudor is a man
who does not take lightly
to threats to his empire.
And what bigger threat
to the naturalized
harvesting empire is there
than human-made ice?
- [Derek] There was no way the Ice King
was giving up his empire without a fight.
- What he ends up doing is
he ends up paying editors
up and down the eastern
seaboard at newspapers
to publish scandalous news
articles about John Gorrie.
So, everywhere from
Tallahassee up to New York,
you see newspapers publishing headlines,
like, "There's this crank
that thinks he can make ice
as good as God Almighty."
And ultimately, John Gorrie,
he does patent his machine,
but he never makes a dime on it.
- Gorrie spent the next few
years in financial ruin.
A decade later, he died
alone and penniless,
most likely succumbing to malaria.
There are reports he suffered
an extremely high fever
in his final days,
the very symptom he had tried to alleviate
for so many years.
But, Gorrie's invention hadn't
been completely ignored.
Soon, others began work on
artificial cooling machines,
including James Harrison,
a Scottish-born engineer
Working in Australia.
Harrison noticed that Gorrie's
machine had one big drawback.
It relied on just two
components to move heat:
a compressor and an expansion engine.
So, instead of using
air to cool his machine,
he tried a different approach.
- I have a can of freeze spray here,
which is a liquid that when
I press down on this button,
comes out and immediately evaporates
into a very, very low-temperature gas.
So, what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna blast it
at this cup of water.
And the process is actually so effective
that in essentially under a minute,
I'm able to get some ice to form in there.
Okay.
So, after a layer of
water, what you get is...
(ice clattering)
A bunch of ice.
(ice clattering)
Now, the reason this works
is because something special happens
when a substance changes phase.
So, in order to go from a liquid to a gas,
it needs to absorb a lot of energy.
And pretty much all this energy
goes into overcoming
the force of attraction
between molecules,
so that they can disperse
and go into the gas phase.
Harrison realized he could
take advantage of this effect
by forcing a fluid to continuously
evaporate and condense
as it's going through a loop.
A modern version looks
something like this.
- [Derek] Start by adding a
liquid under high pressure
to a loop.
Passing this liquid
through an expansion valve
quickly drops the
pressure and temperature,
causing some of the liquid to
immediately turn into a gas.
The mixture then passes
into an evaporator coil,
where the remaining
liquid continues to boil.
But, this phase change
requires a lot of energy.
So, the liquid absorbs
heat from the environment,
and this is what creates
the cooling effect.
(ice cracking)
The cold gas is then cycled
through a compressor,
raising its temperature,
and then it's pushed
through a condenser coil.
Here, the hot gas cools and
turns back into a liquid,
releasing the absorbed heat
back into the environment
before returning to the expansion valve.
(pensive music)
By repeating this cycle
over and over again,
Harrison was reportedly
able to manufacture
as much as 3,000 kilograms of ice per day.
And his machine was a
huge commercial success.
- Meanwhile, public
resistance to Godless ice
and artificial cooling began to fade,
overshadowed by a growing health crisis
linked to natural ice.
One of the reasons artificial
ice was so much better
is because we make it on our own terms.
With natural ice,
we had to wait until the right
season, in the right place,
and then whatever happened
in the water that froze,
like something died or
was rotting in there,
you had to work with it.
- By the time we get to
the mid-19th century,
the peak of the Industrial Revolution,
factories and farms
just letting loose their
chemicals and detritus
into the nearby lakes and rivers.
- You put an ice block into your cocktail,
you could get cholera.
There are, like, stories of hospitals
treating wounds with ice,
and then the ice makes you get a disease,
and your wound isn't even the problem.
- They're getting cholera,
they're getting food
poisoning or ice poisoning.
I mean, they're getting very, very sick.
- It's so funny,
when we were first
talking about this story,
I was thinking about this
frozen New England ice,
and I was just imagining
like the purest lake water,
this crystal-clear ice,
and, like, just this
incredible product, right?
But now that you mentioned it,
like, yeah, it probably
is a lot less hygienic.
And yeah, there's probably germs in there.
(pensive music)
- And so the human-made
ice companies were like,
"Sure, our ice isn't made by God.
But, natural ice will kill you.
So, which one do you want?"
- [Derek] After the first
affordable home refrigerator
landed in the mass market in 1927,
it became one of the fastest
adopted new technologies
of the entire 20th century,
going from less than 1% of
homes having one in the 1920s
to 85% by 1944.
This made its take off even
faster than the motorcar
replacing the horse-drawn cart.
- There's this argument of,
"Would the world really be so different
without refrigeration?"
Like, sure, food,
strawberries, iceberg lettuce,
but then you think about vaccines,
blood donations, insulin,
that the same cold chain
transports those things.
And then, beyond medicine,
the same principles that Harrison
and Gorrie used for their fridges
are what allow us to cool things down
to almost absolute zero.
Over the past century,
so many of the discoveries that we made
rely on this principle of refrigeration:
MRIs, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN,
the James Webb Telescope.
All of that is also refrigeration.
And my favorite is the PCR story,
where Thermus aquaticus was
in a fridge for 16 years
before Kary Mullis discovered it.
There wouldn't have been that connection
to make PCR viable in
that way without a fridge.
- I think it's easier
to focus on the movement
of macroscopic objects
and macroscopic things happening,
but this is really
about controlling motion
on the smallest scale,
controlling thermal motion,
which is a pretty remarkable breakthrough.
I mean, we could heat
things up for a long time,
so you wanna increase the
thermal energy of molecules.
You could do that from
the time we had fire.
But actually, taking those molecules
and figuring out how to
remove their thermal energy
and really slow them down,
that's the refrigeration story.
And that's really recent.
But as you point out, like,
it has profound effects.
Gorrie was able to make ice
because he wasn't afraid
to step outside his own
profession, medicine,
and venture into a new
field, thermodynamics.
And while you probably don't
need to reinvent the fridge,
learning a new skill is always handy.
Here at Veritasium, we
create simulations and models
to test our ideas and illustrate them.
And along the way, our team
has learned to code in Python
to make sure our animations
are as accurate as possible.
So, if you, like us,
want to understand coding
and strengthen your programming skills,
a great place to start is
today's video sponsor, Brilliant.
Brilliant have recently added
new Python and coding courses,
starting from the basics
and working all the way
up to complex topics,
like how AI works.
Each of these is designed
to break down concepts
into smaller pieces,
train your intuition,
and encourage you to
explore your own ideas.
Brilliant helps you build
skills in math, science,
and computer science
through step-by-step interactive learning.
This method is proven
to be far more effective
than just watching
lectures or videos alone.
What I love most is that instead
of dumping formulas on you,
Brilliant guides you to
those, "Aha!" moments
where everything finally clicks.
I have changed my phone a fair few times
over the past five years,
but every time I do,
I make sure to download the Brilliant app
because it's such a great
way to keep my brain engaged.
So, if you want free access
to Brilliant's courses
for a full 30 days,

So, I wanna thank Brilliant
for sponsoring this video,
and I wanna thank you for watching.
