>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 OddLots
 podcast.
 I'm
 Joe
 Weisenthal.


>> And
 I'm
 Tracy
 Aloway.


>> Tracy,
 I
 have
 three
 thoughts
 about


stable
 coins.


>> Oh
 boy.
 Here
 we
 go.
 Just
 three.
 just


three.
 One
 is
 I
 think
 within
 the
 broader


realm
 of
 crypto,
 stable
 coins
 are
 real


and
 here
 to
 stay
 and
 probably
 going
 to


be
 important.
 Two,
 some
 of
 them
 seem


like
 an
 absolute
 cash
 money
 maker


because
 you
 don't
 pay
 any
 yield
 to
 the


holders.
 You
 collect
 the
 yield
 for
 what


you
 have
 backing
 it.
 It's
 a
 great


business
 model.
 It
 seems
 amazing.
 And


three,
 as
 the
 child
 of
 the
 uh
 great


financial
 crisis
 generation,
 I'm


convinced
 that
 if
 crypto
 is
 ever


implicated
 in
 a
 future
 financial
 crisis,


it
 might
 have
 something
 to
 do
 with


stable
 coins.
 You
 stole
 all
 my
 talking


points,
 Joe.


>> Honestly,
 the
 same
 brain.


>> I
 had
 like
 the
 note
 written
 down
 that,


you
 know,
 issuing
 liabilities
 that


mostly
 return
 nothing
 is
 a
 wonderful


business
 model.


>> What
 else
 did
 you
 could
 just
 restate
 in


your
 words?


>> Well,
 also
 I
 was
 thinking
 stable
 coins


are
 basically
 the
 primary
 touch
 point
 of


crypto
 to
 the
 regulated
 financial


system.
 And
 so
 you
 would
 expect
 some
 of


those
 financial
 stability
 concerns
 to


potentially
 materialize
 there.
 And
 then


the
 one
 thing
 you
 didn't
 mention
 that


I'm
 interested
 in
 is
 also
 this
 idea
 of


competition
 directly
 with
 the
 banks.
 And


as
 stable
 coins
 get
 more
 money
 market


fund
 like
 maybe
 more
 depositlike,
 we


have
 some
 stable
 coins
 that
 issue
 yield.


Now


>> what
 does
 that
 actually
 look
 like
 for


the
 financial
 landscape?


>> Totally.
 For
 traditional
 payment


companies
 of
 all
 sorts,
 I
 mean
 we
 all


know
 that
 legacy
 payment
 companies


collect
 a
 pretty
 big
 rent
 so
 to
 speak


for
 use
 of
 their
 network.
 In
 theory,


there
 could
 be
 almost
 no
 cost
 at
 all
 for


a
 stable
 coin
 transaction
 or
 virtually


minimal.
 It
 seems
 appealing.
 On
 the


other
 hand,
 getting
 people
 to
 switch
 on


mass
 from
 using
 like
 a
 sort
 of
 debit


card
 or
 credit
 card
 to
 a
 stable
 coin
 is


sort
 of
 a
 tricky
 chicken
 and
 egg


problem,
 but
 you
 know,
 it's
 a
 real


competitor
 to
 an
 existing
 way
 of
 doing


payments.


>> Also,
 the
 one
 thing
 we
 didn't
 mention
 is


it's
 kind
 of
 becoming
 important
 from
 a


fiscal
 standpoint
 for
 the
 United
 States.


And
 you
 have
 Treasury
 Secretary
 Scott


Bessant
 saying
 that
 he
 expects
 all
 this


new
 stable
 coin
 issuance
 to
 basically


increase
 demand
 for
 US
 debt
 for


treasuries
 for
 mostly
 tea
 bills.
 And
 so


there's
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.


>> There
 is
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.
 We
 really


do
 have
 the
 perfect
 guest
 today.
 We
 are


going
 to
 be
 speaking
 with
 Jeremy.
 He
 is


the
 co-founder
 and
 CEO
 of
 Circle


Internet.
 They
 recently
 went
 public
 in


early
 June
 and
 they've
 had
 a
 monster


IPO.
 Incredible
 demand
 for
 this
 company.


incredible
 enthusiasm.
 They
 are
 of


course
 the
 sponsor
 of
 USDC,
 one
 of
 I


think
 it's
 the
 second
 biggest
 stable


coin
 out
 there
 after
 Tether.
 So
 Jeremy,


thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 uh
 coming
 in


studio
 here
 on
 OddLots.


>> I'm
 really
 excited
 to
 be
 here.
 As
 uh
 you


guys
 laid
 out,
 there's
 a
 lot
 to
 talk


about.


>> I
 said
 it
 in
 the
 beginning,
 stable
 coins


seem
 like
 an
 incredible
 business
 model


because
 here
 you
 have
 all
 these
 people


holding
 a
 non-yield
 bearing
 token.


They're
 backed
 by
 in
 many
 cases
 yield


bearing
 assets
 that
 incorporate
 a
 lot.


On
 the
 other
 hand,
 in
 Circle's
 case,
 a


lot
 of
 the
 money
 that
 occurs
 to
 you
 goes


straight
 to
 Coinbase.
 Explain
 to
 us
 your


relationship
 with
 Coinbase
 and
 so
 people


can
 understand
 sort
 of
 the
 economics
 of


the
 money
 that
 you
 bring
 in
 and
 then
 how


it
 goes
 out
 the
 door.


>> Yeah,
 maybe
 I'll
 actually
 start
 with


something
 a
 little
 bit
 higher
 level
 and


then
 drill
 in.
 So
 when
 we
 think
 about


our
 business
 and
 what
 we
 have
 built
 and


what
 we
 operate
 is
 we
 think
 about
 it
 as


an
 internet
 scale
 platform
 and
 network


utility.
 So,
 we're
 a
 set
 of
 software
 on


the
 public
 internet
 that
 people
 can


build
 on
 and
 integrate
 to
 and
 it


provides
 this
 utility
 which
 is
 this


global
 utility
 for
 storing
 and
 moving


value
 around
 the
 world.
 And
 there's
 a


regulated
 part
 of
 it
 and
 there's
 a


technology
 part
 of
 it.
 And
 so,
 as
 part


of
 that,
 we
 want
 to
 build
 the
 largest


stable
 coin
 network
 in
 the
 world
 with


the
 most
 usage
 and
 the
 most
 transactions


and
 the
 most
 utility.
 We
 can
 talk
 more


about
 what
 that
 looks
 like.
 And
 as
 we


built
 this,
 as
 we
 launched
 this
 back
 in


2018,
 we
 knew
 that
 we
 needed
 to
 really


focus
 on
 building
 upfront
 utility
 and


then
 building
 really
 good
 distribution


relationships.
 And
 so
 in
 our
 business,


we
 have
 sort
 of
 the
 scale
 of
 the


network,
 which
 is
 measured
 by
 the
 number


of
 people
 who
 can
 reach
 in
 their
 pocket


and
 use
 USDC.
 There
 are
 over
 600
 million


accounts
 that
 can
 access
 and
 use
 USDC


around
 the
 world.
 A
 lot
 of
 that
 is


through
 distribution
 partners
 that
 we


have


>> like
 Coinbase.
 Coinbase
 is
 one,
 Binance


is
 another,
 and
 many,
 many
 more.
 You
 can


find
 USDC
 on
 Robin
 Hood,
 on
 Kraken.
 You


can
 find
 USDC
 in
 super
 apps
 in
 foreign


countries
 like
 New
 Bank,
 the
 biggest
 NEO


bank
 in
 Brazil,
 or
 in
 a
 product
 like


GCash
 in
 the
 Philippines,
 which
 is
 the


dominant
 financial
 product
 for
 many


Filipinos.
 And
 so,
 we
 make
 that
 product


available
 globally.
 And
 we
 have
 a


philosophy
 of
 incentivizing,
 you
 know,


distributors
 to
 grow
 with
 us.
 And
 so,
 I


think
 that's
 really
 fundamental
 to
 the


philosophy.
 And
 right
 now
 I
 think
 we're


in
 the
 early
 stages
 of
 building
 this.


You
 know,
 the
 the
 numbers
 in
 the


aggregate
 are
 sizable,
 but
 when
 we
 think


about
 what
 this
 can
 grow
 into
 and
 the


volume
 of
 money
 storage
 and
 money


movement
 that
 will
 happen
 in
 an
 internet


native
 way,
 you
 know,
 we
 we
 think
 we're


still
 in
 the
 very
 early
 stages
 of
 that.


I
 mean,
 I
 understand
 that
 argument,
 but


Coinbase
 also
 took,
 I
 think,
 more
 than


50%
 of
 your
 revenue
 from
 reserve
 assets


last
 year,
 which
 seems
 like
 a
 lot
 to
 pay


for
 distribution
 when
 you're
 already
 the


second
 biggest
 stable
 coin
 in
 the
 world.


Is
 that
 partnership,
 you
 know,
 will
 the


math
 always
 make
 sense
 to
 you?
 And
 I


guess
 how
 often
 do
 you
 actually
 renew


that
 agreement?


>> Yeah,
 so
 a
 couple
 things.
 So,
 first
 of


all,
 we
 have
 a
 great
 relationship
 with


Coinbase.
 They've
 been
 such
 a
 huge


partner
 and
 really
 bet
 big
 on
 this
 way


before
 anyone
 else.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 I


give
 Brian
 a
 lot
 of
 credit
 for
 really


seeing
 that
 USDC
 could
 be
 a
 fundamental


part
 of
 their
 entire
 business.
 And


really
 they've
 baked
 USDC
 into
 all
 their


retail
 products,
 their
 institutional


products.
 They're
 building
 new
 payments


products
 around
 it.
 They're
 really


betting
 not
 the
 entire
 company,
 but


they're
 betting
 a
 lot
 on
 it.
 And
 that's


amazing.
 And
 when
 you
 think
 about


networks
 that
 were
 built
 in
 the
 past


from
 the
 70s
 or
 the
 80s
 or
 in
 other


times,
 you
 definitely
 need
 these
 big


anchor
 tenants
 that
 really
 bet
 on
 it
 and


help
 drive
 the
 utility.
 But
 to
 the


degree
 that
 Coinbase
 has
 leaned
 in,


that's
 really
 helped
 create
 demand
 for


usage
 in
 other
 places.
 So
 Coinbase's


largest
 rival,
 Binance,
 for
 example,
 is


also
 a
 significant
 partner
 on
 this.
 And


I
 think
 with
 the
 Genius
 Act
 passing,


which
 I
 know
 we'll
 come
 back
 to,
 and


regulatory
 clarity
 kind
 of
 happening


around
 the
 world,
 we're
 entering
 a
 new


chapter
 in
 all
 of
 this.
 We
 were
 sort
 of


in
 the
 early
 adopter
 phase,
 which
 was


really
 primarily
 anchored
 in
 like
 crypto


trading
 markets
 and
 things
 like
 that.


And
 now
 we're
 entering
 this
 kind
 of
 more


mainstream
 phase
 where
 payment


companies,
 banks,
 financial


institutions,
 capital
 markets
 companies,


lots
 of
 consumer
 companies,
 consumer


internet
 companies
 are
 all
 getting


involved.
 And
 so
 our
 view
 is
 that
 the


sort
 of
 share
 of
 the
 pie
 as
 it
 were
 is


going
 to
 be
 more
 and
 more
 diversified


and
 grow
 the
 pie
 will
 grow
 and
 the


diversity
 of
 the
 participants
 and
 that


will
 grow
 over
 time
 as
 well.


>> Real
 quickly,
 what
 is
 the
 genius
 act


mean
 for
 your
 business?
 What
 changes
 pre


and
 post
 Genius
 Act?
 So
 Genius
 Act
 is


very
 significant
 in
 our
 view
 and
 it's


actually
 in
 some
 ways
 we've
 been
 arguing


for
 kind
 of
 federal
 policy
 and


regulation
 around
 this
 new
 form
 of


electronic
 money
 to
 some
 degree
 since
 I


went
 to
 the
 capital
 in
 2013
 and
 started


articulating
 a
 regulatory
 view
 on
 this


but
 in
 a
 very
 significant
 way
 really
 for


the
 last
 5
 years
 we've
 been
 pushing
 for


federal
 regulation
 and
 what
 that
 does
 is


first
 of
 all
 it
 enshrines
 in
 federal


law,
 many
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we
 had
 made


core
 to
 the
 way
 we
 operate,


transparency,
 having
 major
 audits
 of
 our


firm,
 safety
 and
 soundness
 requirements.


It
 ensures
 that
 the
 reserve
 itself
 is


effectively
 a
 cash
 instrument
 and
 allows


this
 to
 be
 treated
 as
 a
 cash
 instrument.


And
 by
 having
 that
 federal
 framework,
 it


opens
 up
 opportunities
 in
 two


significant
 ways.
 I
 think
 the
 first
 is


now
 if
 you're
 a
 a
 corporation,
 a
 public


corporation,
 or
 you're
 a
 financial


institution,
 you
 now
 know
 what
 these


are.
 You
 can
 hold
 these
 and
 treat
 these


like
 cash
 on
 your
 balance
 sheet.
 This


paves
 the
 way
 for
 the
 use
 of
 payment


stable
 coins
 in
 wholesale
 payments,


retail
 payments,
 as
 eligible
 collateral


on
 capital
 markets,
 venues.
 So
 it
 really


opens
 up
 the
 aperture
 of
 what
 people
 can


use
 this
 for
 and
 it
 gives
 all
 those


financial
 institutions
 and
 and
 companies


the
 clear
 definition
 and
 the
 faith
 that


they
 can
 interact
 with
 this
 and
 they


know
 it's
 bankruptcy
 protected
 and
 all


this
 good
 stuff.
 The
 other
 big
 thing
 is


that
 and
 this
 ties
 into
 one
 of
 the


opening
 comments
 is
 having
 this
 as
 a


defined
 part
 of
 the
 US
 financial
 system.


So,
 stablecoin
 money,
 which
 in
 my
 view


is
 a
 new
 form
 of
 M1
 electronic
 money,


having
 that
 as
 a
 defined
 part
 of
 the
 US


financial
 system,
 means
 that
 it
 can
 be


expanded
 internationally
 in
 very


significant
 ways.
 Governments
 all
 around


the
 world
 will
 be
 able
 to
 enact
 their


own
 stable
 coin
 laws
 as
 they
 are,
 and
 I


can
 talk
 about
 a
 dozen
 countries
 where


that's
 the
 case,
 and
 they
 can
 recognize


issuers
 that
 are
 under
 federal


supervision
 in
 the
 US
 and
 enable
 those


to
 interact
 with
 their
 markets.
 And
 so


it
 opens
 up
 the
 global
 adoption
 here


within
 the
 regulated
 financial
 system
 in


a
 very
 major
 way.
 And
 so
 for
 us,
 all
 of


that
 is
 we
 view
 as
 a
 tailwind
 to
 have


more
 and
 more
 people
 building
 on
 top
 of


this
 infrastructure
 that
 we've
 been


building.


>> So
 in
 terms
 of
 integration
 with
 the


financial
 system
 and
 competition
 with


the
 banks,
 of
 course,
 you
 still
 under


the
 Genius
 Act,
 you
 do
 not
 have
 access


to
 the
 Fed's
 balance
 sheet.
 Is
 that


right?


>> That's
 correct.
 So
 a
 couple
 things.
 So


one
 is
 the
 Genius
 Act
 doesn't
 sort
 of


specify
 who
 has
 access
 to
 the
 Fed's


balance
 sheet.
 What
 it
 does
 say
 though


is
 that
 uh
 uh
 eligible
 reserves
 in
 a


stable
 coin
 can
 include
 cash
 at
 the
 Fed.


It
 can
 include
 short
 duration
 T
 bills.


It
 can
 include
 repo
 treasury
 repo


facilities
 etc.
 And
 for
 us
 as
 circle,
 we


actually
 just
 announced
 very
 recently


that
 we
 had
 filed
 to
 establish
 a
 new


entity
 called
 First
 National
 Digital


Currency
 Bank.
 And
 First
 National


Digital
 Currency
 Bank
 is
 in
 application


with
 the
 OC
 to
 become
 a
 national
 trust


bank.
 And
 under
 the
 Genius
 Act,
 as
 a


large
 issuer,
 greater
 than
 10
 billion,


you
 know,
 we're
 around
 64
 billion
 today,


you
 know,
 we
 will
 come
 under
 OC


supervision.
 And
 so
 we're
 trying
 to
 line


up
 the
 kind
 of
 infrastructure
 of
 Circle


against
 the
 kind
 of
 upcoming
 regulatory


regime
 and
 we
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 we've


got
 the
 best
 underlying
 kind
 of


infrastructure
 there
 for
 people
 who


would
 build
 on
 us.
 So
 I
 said
 in
 the


intro
 that
 my
 worry
 is
 that
 if
 there
 was


ever
 a
 financial
 crisis
 that
 involves


crypto
 connected,
 it's
 going
 to
 be


somehow
 due
 to
 stable
 coins
 because
 I


always
 think
 like
 entities
 that
 are


pegged
 to
 the
 dollar
 that
 deviate
 from


the
 dollar,
 that's
 where
 you
 get
 into


trouble.
 People
 think
 this
 is
 a
 dollar


and
 suddenly
 it's
 worth
 95
 cents.
 That


actually
 did
 happen
 to
 circle
 in
 early


2023
 very
 briefly
 with
 the
 collapse
 of


SVB.
 Could
 that
 ever
 happen
 again
 or
 is


there
 a
 way
 to
 say
 this
 could
 never


happen
 again?


>> Well,
 a
 couple
 things.
 So,
 secondary


market
 trading
 is
 where
 we
 saw
 that.
 But


we've


>> But
 you
 weren't
 able
 the
 desks
 weren't


able
 to
 keep
 it
 at
 a
 dollar.
 Whatever
 it


was
 that
 did
 happen.
 That's
 because
 the


banks
 were
 seized
 by
 the
 federal


government
 and
 so
 banking
 was
 not


available
 over
 that
 time.
 But


nonetheless,
 it's
 a
 really
 important


question.
 It's
 a
 fundamental
 question,


right?
 Which
 is
 the
 real
 question
 in
 my


mind
 is
 is
 a
 full
 reserve
 model
 of
 money


a
 safer
 model
 of
 money
 than
 a
 fractional


reserve
 model
 of
 money.
 And
 in
 our


financial
 system
 today,
 we
 do
 have
 FDIC


for
 the
 fractional
 reserve
 banks.
 Now,


that's
 for
 small
 depositors.
 The
 vast


majority
 of
 deposits
 in
 the
 banking


system
 are
 uninsured
 deposits.
 Now,
 some


of
 those
 sit
 with
 so-called
 too
 big
 to


fail
 financial
 institutions,
 therefore


implicitly
 have
 the
 bailout
 power
 of
 the


federal
 government,
 like
 we'd
 never
 let


them
 fail.
 But
 that's
 sort
 of


theoretical.
 You
 could
 imagine
 a


scenario
 where
 the
 federal
 government


doesn't
 have
 the
 balance
 sheet
 or
 it


doesn't
 want
 to
 create
 the
 inflation
 or


or
 whatever
 it
 would
 be.


>> The
 lack
 of
 political
 appetite.


>> Lack
 of
 political
 appetite.
 I
 mean,
 that


was
 on
 the
 verge
 in
 the
 financial
 crisis


that
 was
 jamming
 it
 through
 Congress,


which
 was
 then
 challenged
 later.
 But
 I


think
 and
 by
 the
 way
 this
 gets
 to
 the


genesis
 of
 circle
 like
 why
 did
 I
 start


this
 company?
 I
 spent
 a
 number
 of
 years


like
 reading
 about
 what
 happened
 with


the
 financial
 crisis
 how
 did
 this


happen?
 What
 is
 the
 nature
 of
 money?


What
 is
 the
 nature
 of
 central
 banking?


How
 does
 the
 international
 monetary


system
 work?
 All
 of
 these
 things
 were


fascinating
 to
 me
 and
 I
 was
 running
 a


completely
 different
 kind
 of
 business


which
 was
 an
 online
 video
 technology


business
 and
 I
 kind
 of
 thought


intuitively
 that
 there
 had
 to
 be
 a


better
 way
 and
 it
 was
 actually
 through


my
 kind
 of
 introduction
 to
 crypto
 in


2012
 that
 I
 sort
 of
 saw
 hey
 there
 might


be
 a
 path
 here
 and
 while
 a
 lot
 of
 people


were
 obviously
 focused
 on
 Bitcoin
 as
 a


full
 reserve
 sort
 of
 sound
 money


philosophy
 and
 I'm
 sure
 you've
 had


plenty
 of
 people
 to
 talk
 about
 that.
 Oh


yes.


>> Over
 the
 over
 the
 years,


>> but
 for
 me
 at
 least
 the
 idea
 of
 sound


money
 of
 kind
 of
 having
 a
 different
 risk


model
 in
 the
 financial
 system
 was
 very


appealing
 to
 me
 and
 in
 particular
 this


idea
 of
 fully
 reserved
 dollar
 digital


currency
 and
 you
 know
 I'm
 an
 adherent
 to


the
 Chicago
 school
 and
 the
 Chicago
 plan


I
 should
 say
 which
 was
 a
 particular


philosophy
 that
 was
 advanced
 in
 the


aftermath
 of
 all
 of
 the
 bank
 failures
 in


the
 1930.
 1930s
 and
 there
 were
 really


two
 responses.
 There
 was
 a
 group
 of


prominent
 economists
 some
 of
 Irving


Fischer
 who
 was
 at
 the
 Chicago
 school
 at


the
 time
 and
 there
 was
 industry
 and
 the


prominent
 economist
 said
 hey
 we
 could


build
 a
 full
 reserve
 model
 where
 you


have
 essentially
 government
 obligation


money
 or
 this
 full
 reserve
 form
 of
 money


that
 is
 in
 a
 payment
 type
 of
 institution


a
 payment
 bank
 and
 then
 you
 have
 a


separate
 institution
 which
 does
 credit


and
 you
 can
 only
 you
 can't
 create
 new


money
 out
 of
 thin
 air
 as
 banks
 do.
 you


could
 only
 lend
 the
 full
 reserve
 money


and
 the
 philosophy
 there
 was
 that
 that


would
 sort
 of
 reduce
 risk
 in
 in
 the


financial
 system
 and
 it
 would
 smooth
 out


economic
 cycles
 and
 that's
 come
 and
 gone


as
 a
 debate
 during
 the
 savings
 and
 loan


crisis
 after
 the
 great
 financial
 crisis


etc.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 advent
 of
 digital


currency
 in
 particular
 creates
 an


opportunity
 for
 this
 that
 I
 think
 is


really
 profound
 and
 when
 you
 think
 about


native
 money
 on
 the
 internet.
 So
 take


something
 like
 USDC
 which
 underrogenius


sort
 of
 gets
 defined
 as
 this
 cash


instrument
 the
 reserve
 instruments
 we


can
 discuss
 are
 those
 you
 know
 safe
 in


the
 sense
 of
 financial
 stability
 safe


but
 you
 have
 a
 fully
 reserved


instrument.
 What's
 powerful
 about


digital
 currency
 is
 it
 inherits
 what
 I


call
 the
 superpowers
 of
 the
 internet.


Meaning
 it
 inherits
 the
 speed
 and


velocity
 of
 data
 on
 the
 internet.
 And
 so


all
 of
 a
 sudden
 the
 marginal
 cost
 of


storing
 and
 moving
 value
 goes
 very
 close


to
 zero
 and
 money
 velocity
 can


accelerate
 significantly
 and
 that


creates
 its
 own
 risks.
 But
 this
 high


velocity
 money
 that's
 moving
 on
 the


internet
 that
 can
 move
 literally
 from


any
 person
 entity
 any
 AI
 agent
 any


business
 all
 these
 sort
 of
 machine


interactions
 all
 this
 stuff
 that
 happens


globally
 it's
 kind
 of
 crazy
 to
 think


about
 having
 that
 be
 the
 underlying
 on


that
 to
 be
 like
 a
 bank's
 stack
 of


lending
 risk
 and
 to
 have
 all
 of
 these


lending
 risk
 IUS
 floating
 free


circulating
 on
 the
 internet
 and
 so
 my


view
 is
 that
 the
 base


of
 money
 in
 the
 internet
 financial


system
 which
 I
 think
 is
 a
 new
 financial


system
 that's
 being
 built
 up
 from
 the


ground
 up
 that
 the
 base
 layer
 of
 money


needs
 to
 be
 this
 full
 reserve
 form
 of


money
 that
 is
 actually
 safer
 that
 begs


the
 question
 of
 how
 do
 you
 do
 credit
 and


all
 that
 good
 stuff
 which
 I'm
 happy
 to


give
 you
 my
 views
 on
 but
 I
 think
 the


philosophy
 is
 actually
 how
 do
 you
 do


something
 that's
 actually
 safer
 that


people
 can
 look
 at
 and
 say
 I
 know
 that


this
 is
 always
 available
 it's
 not
 that


if
 the
 bank
 fails
 I
 might
 get
 my
 FDIC


insurance
 cap.
 It's
 like
 I
 know
 what


this
 is
 and
 there's
 a
 credential


supervisor
 and
 there's
 actually
 this


enforced
 risk
 management
 which
 improves


and
 continues
 to
 improve
 over
 time.


[Music]


You
 know,
 you
 mentioned
 the
 safety
 of


the
 reserve
 assets
 and
 this
 is
 something


that
 is
 in
 the
 act.
 It
 kind
 of
 defines


what
 you're
 supposed
 to
 hold.
 So
 things


like
 tea
 bills,
 highquality
 liquid


assets,
 all
 that
 good
 stuff.
 We've
 been


talking
 about
 a
 safe
 asset
 shortage
 in


the
 financial
 system
 for
 it
 feels
 like


decades
 now,
 right?
 It
 feels
 like
 there


is
 not
 enough
 good
 collateral
 to
 go


around
 for
 everyone.
 And
 as
 stable
 coins


ramp
 up,
 I'm
 really
 curious
 if
 you're


worried
 about
 the
 crowning
 out
 effect,


if
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 enough
 tea
 bills


in
 the
 world
 to
 satisfy
 that
 1:1
 reserve


requirement.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 if
 it
 was
 exclusively
 on
 the


basis
 of
 short-term
 government
 debt
 and


this
 got
 to
 be
 tens
 of
 trillions
 of


dollars
 or
 whatever,
 then
 then
 you
 might


have
 a
 mismatch
 there.
 Now,
 obviously,


regulation
 isn't
 going
 to
 stand
 still
 on


this.
 So
 the
 genius
 act
 is
 a
 significant


piece
 of
 legislation
 and
 it
 defines
 this


framework.
 That
 framework
 is
 inclusive


of
 cash
 that
 is
 overcolateralized


lending
 with
 repo
 desks.
 It
 includes
 T


bills
 of
 the
 shortest
 duration
 and
 it


does
 include
 cash
 in
 the
 financial


system
 and
 it
 includes
 eligible
 reserves


at
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 as
 cash
 as
 well.


And
 so
 over
 time
 as
 this
 infrastructure


scales
 I
 think
 that
 mixture
 gives
 us
 a


huge
 amount
 of
 capacity
 that
 I
 think
 you


know
 arguably
 could
 support
 many
 tens
 of


trillions
 of
 of
 dollars
 of
 value.


>> So
 wait
 just
 to
 be
 clear
 on
 one
 specific


are
 you
 completely
 non-exposed
 to


non-FDIC
 insured
 deposits?
 Are
 you


completely
 extricated
 yourself
 from
 that


system?
 No.
 And
 and
 in
 fact,
 let
 me


describe
 what
 we
 do.
 And
 we
 today
 by
 far


operate
 with
 the
 greatest
 transparency


of
 any
 other
 stable
 coin,
 any
 other,
 you


know,
 regulated
 stable
 coin
 in
 the


world.
 And
 we've
 done
 that
 through
 a


couple
 of
 things.
 The
 first
 is
 we


created
 a
 structure
 called
 the
 circle


reserve
 fund,
 which
 is
 really
 designed


to
 provide
 transparency
 into
 the


reserves.
 So
 we
 did
 that
 with
 BlackRock


and
 it's
 an
 SEC
 registered
 what's
 called


2A7
 fund.
 So,
 it's
 a
 government


obligation
 fund,
 but
 it
 gives
 daily


transparency
 into
 essentially
 about
 90%


of
 everything
 in
 the
 reserves.
 And
 so,


you
 can
 look
 every
 day.
 You
 can
 search


USDXX.


>> I
 pulled
 it
 up
 on
 my
 blue.


>> There
 you
 go.
 And
 you
 can
 drill
 in
 and


you
 can
 see
 exactly
 the
 serial
 numbers


of
 every
 T
 bill,
 the
 short
 duration
 T


bills,
 and
 we
 I
 think
 we
 have
 an
 average


maturity
 of
 about
 23
 days
 in
 that


reserve.
 And
 um


>> Bloomberg
 says
 13
 right
 now,
 but
 I'm
 not


I
 don't
 I
 you
 know,
 whatever.


>> Is
 that
 what
 it
 says?


>> That's
 what
 it
 says.
 I'm
 just
 looking


I'm
 just
 looking
 at
 the
 screen.
 That
 may


in
 fact
 I'm
 just
 looking
 at
 the
 screen.


>> That
 may
 in
 fact
 be
 what
 it
 is
 today.


That's
 that's
 what
 Bloomberg
 says.


Great.
 Um


>> and
 and
 then
 you
 can
 also
 see
 like
 the


global
 systemically
 important
 banks
 that


we
 have
 repo
 relationships
 with
 and
 and


that's
 there
 as
 well.
 So
 you
 can
 see


that
 that's
 about
 90%.
 And
 then
 there's


cash
 and
 the
 cash
 about
 98%
 of
 the
 cash


is
 held
 with
 a
 very
 limited
 number
 of


global
 systemically
 important
 banks.
 And


these
 global
 systemically
 important


banks
 are
 the
 sort
 of
 lowest
 credit
 risk


kind
 of
 cash
 custodian
 type
 banks.
 And


so
 we
 hold
 the
 reserves
 there.
 Now
 you


can
 argue
 about
 how
 safe
 is
 that
 cash


relative
 to,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of
 sharted


out
 across
 all
 kinds
 of
 other
 stuff.
 But


that's
 sort
 of
 what's
 there
 today.
 And


we
 need
 to
 do
 that
 because
 we
 need


intraday
 liquidity.
 We
 need
 to
 ensure


that
 in
 the
 event
 of
 5
 billion,
 10


billion,
 whatever
 it
 is,
 that's
 always


available.
 And
 then
 there's
 a
 very
 very


limited
 amount
 which
 we
 position
 in


settlement
 banks
 uh
 and
 and
 reserve


accounts
 in
 different
 geographies
 to


ensure
 that
 it's
 easy
 to
 create
 and


redeem
 USDC
 whether
 you're
 in
 Singapore


or
 Japan
 or
 Europe
 and
 and
 other
 places.


We
 also
 have
 a
 separate
 issuance
 of
 USDC


and
 a
 a
 completely
 separate
 reserve


mandate
 and
 supervision
 in
 Europe
 as


well.
 So
 we
 dualissue
 USDC.
 We
 issue
 it


under
 European
 rules
 under
 the
 Mika


stable
 coin
 statutes
 and
 we
 issue
 it
 in


the
 United
 States
 and
 we
 have
 created
 a


way
 for
 kind
 of
 fungeibility
 across


those.
 H
 is
 the
 ultimate
 ambition
 to


really
 take
 on
 and
 compete
 with
 the


deposit
 taking
 institutions
 in
 the
 sense


that
 you
 want
 to
 get
 big
 corporate


clients
 maybe
 the
 type
 of
 clients
 that


would
 put
 their
 money
 in
 uninsur
 well


they
 have
 so
 much
 money
 some
 of
 it
 would


end
 up
 being
 uninsured
 by
 FDIC
 or
 they


might
 put
 it
 in
 a
 money
 market
 fund
 or


something
 like
 that
 and
 if
 you're
 doing


that
 doesn't
 it
 seem
 like
 the
 biggest


hurdle
 is
 the
 lack
 of
 interest
 paid
 on


stable
 coins


>> so
 a
 Couple
 things
 I
 think
 the
 first
 is


that
 payment
 stable
 coins
 which
 is
 what


the
 Genius
 Act
 governs
 it
 and
 in
 fact


mirrors
 stable
 coin
 laws
 in
 Europe
 in


Japan
 and
 in
 other
 markets
 that
 are


bringing
 these
 online.
 These
 are


designed
 to
 be
 cash
 instruments
 that
 are


used
 in
 payments
 and
 as
 a
 as
 a
 payment


system
 technology.
 They're
 not
 designed


to
 be
 risk-taking
 instruments
 that
 you


would
 say
 deposit
 and
 lend.
 And
 they're


not
 designed
 to
 be
 investment
 products.


You're
 not
 purchasing
 a
 security.
 you're


not
 purchasing
 an
 investment.
 And
 so


they're
 narrowly
 defined
 and
 Genius
 Act


enforces
 that.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 the


right
 design
 for
 this
 base
 layer
 kind
 of


cash
 instrument.
 Now
 that
 doesn't
 mean


that
 you
 can't
 build
 digital
 tokens
 that


present
 yield.
 And
 while
 people
 call


these
 stable
 coins,
 I
 think
 that
 term
 of


art
 will
 probably
 change.
 People
 call


them
 tokenized
 real
 world
 assets,


tokenized
 money
 market
 phones,
 tokenized


treasuries.
 So
 we
 operate
 a
 sizable


tokenized
 money
 market
 fund
 product


called
 USYC
 and
 USYC
 is
 fungeible
 with


USDC.
 So
 a
 business
 for
 example
 could


hold
 USYC
 and
 earn
 the
 yield
 that
 would


be
 your
 typical
 kind
 of
 government
 fund


type
 yield
 but
 have
 the
 ability
 to


instantly
 create
 and
 redeem
 cash
 and


instantly
 create
 and
 redeem
 yield.
 And


so
 we
 acquired
 a
 company
 called
 Hashnote


and
 we've
 integrated
 that
 into
 our
 core


infrastructure
 and
 we've
 just
 brought


this
 online.
 It's
 it's
 a
 very
 powerful


structure
 if
 you
 can
 have
 tokenized


yield
 bearing
 collateral
 and
 then


instantly
 uses
 as
 cash
 for
 settlement


for
 trading
 for
 spending
 etc.
 And
 so
 I


think
 that
 that's
 something
 that
 we
 can


kind
 of
 do
 uniquely
 because
 we
 have
 this


widely
 adopted
 payment
 stable
 coin
 and


then
 kind
 of
 marrying
 those
 two
 together


and
 and
 we
 can
 do
 it
 in
 a
 very
 very


capital
 efficient
 way
 because


essentially
 the
 reserves
 of
 USDC
 mirror


the
 actual
 instruments
 in
 USYC
 and
 so


there's
 a
 sort
 of
 fungeability
 between


USYC
 and
 USDC
 reserves.
 So
 let's
 talk


about
 the
 competitive
 landscape
 in
 a
 few


years
 from
 now.
 So,
 at
 some
 point,


you're
 going
 to
 revisit
 your
 agreement


with
 Coinbase.
 Maybe
 JP
 Morgan
 will
 have


a
 payment
 coin
 that
 they're
 going
 to


want
 to
 be
 the
 preferred
 coin
 that
 sits


there.
 And
 maybe
 they're
 going
 to
 be


willing
 to
 give
 Coinbase
 a
 huge
 split


for
 Pride
 of
 Place.
 Or
 maybe
 there'll
 be


some
 other
 coin
 that
 they
 use
 for


interbank
 settlements
 that'll
 be


tokenized
 in
 some
 way
 to
 make
 their


transfers
 with
 City
 and
 Bank
 of
 America


and
 other
 banks
 more
 competitive.
 We


have
 seen
 other
 coins
 rise,
 First


Digital
 in
 Asia,
 for
 example.
 like
 if


you're
 paying
 all
 this
 money
 to
 Coinbase


still
 and
 you
 you
 know
 distribution
 is


so
 important
 what
 is
 the
 competitive


advantage
 that
 Circle
 has
 in
 say
 the


year
 I
 don't
 know
 2028
 well
 I
 I
 think
 a


couple
 things
 I
 think
 the
 first
 is
 that


to
 understand
 circle's
 business
 is
 to


understand
 that
 we
 operate
 an
 internet


scale
 platform
 and
 network
 utility
 we


have
 very
 powerful
 internet
 platform


flywheels
 and
 developer
 flywheels
 we


have
 a
 network
 that
 consists
 of


thousands
 and
 thous
 thousands
 of


products
 and
 services
 that
 have


implemented
 and
 integrated
 to
 our


network.
 And
 so
 every
 time
 a
 developer


says,
 "Hey,
 I
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 store


and
 move
 digital
 dollars,
 they
 choose
 to


implement
 USDC
 because
 USDC
 has
 this


really
 broad
 established
 network."
 And


so
 we
 have
 these
 really
 powerful


flywheels
 and
 as
 that
 provides
 new


utility
 to
 a
 user
 when
 say
 new
 bank
 in


Brazil
 adds
 USDC,
 wow,
 there's
 like
 100


million
 people
 at
 New
 Bank
 who
 can


interact
 with
 USDC.
 Now
 the
 rest
 of
 the


world
 can
 benefit
 from
 that
 user
 base
 of


100
 million
 people.
 And
 so
 we
 have


network
 effects
 that
 are
 there
 and
 those


exist
 in
 in
 pretty
 powerful
 ways.
 So
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 movement
 of
 stablecoin


in
 the
 onchain
 ecosystem,
 what
 sometimes


people
 call
 DeFi,
 we
 have
 about
 I


believe
 today
 around
 75%
 of
 the
 market


there.
 And
 we've
 built
 protocols
 that


make
 it
 very
 seamless,
 safe,
 and
 secure


and
 capital
 efficient
 to
 transmit
 USDC


across
 all
 these
 different
 networks.


We've
 built
 developer
 platforms.
 We've


built
 flywheels
 for
 adoption.
 And
 this


is
 a
 classic
 internet
 platform
 model.


The
 other
 is
 that
 we've
 built
 these


extraordinary
 liquidity
 network
 effects.


And
 this
 is
 really
 critical.
 So
 over
 the


past
 number
 of
 years,
 we've
 built
 out
 on


a
 regulated
 basis
 infrastructure
 where


we're
 regulated
 and
 where
 we
 have


integration
 into
 the
 financial
 systems


of
 Singapore,
 Hong
 Kong,
 Japan,
 the


United
 Kingdom,
 the
 EU,
 the
 US.
 We've


integrated
 into
 Brazil,
 Mexico,
 and


we've
 just
 announced
 that
 we're
 coming


online
 in
 UAE.
 So,
 we've
 built
 out
 these


integration
 points,
 and
 we've
 built
 out


primary
 liquidity
 in
 all
 of
 these


markets.
 And
 so,
 USDC
 is
 available
 and


liquid
 at
 scale
 all
 around
 the
 world.


That's
 the
 primary
 liquidity
 side.
 And


and
 so
 that's
 crucial.
 If
 you're
 going


to
 use
 this,
 you
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 know


I
 can
 get
 in,
 I
 can
 get
 out,
 and
 I
 can


do
 that
 all
 around
 the
 world.
 And
 then


we've
 created
 very
 large
 secondary


liquidity,
 and
 that's
 really
 important


as
 well.
 So
 when
 you
 get
 down
 to
 the


e-money
 product
 in
 Vietnam,
 can
 you
 go


from
 that
 e-money
 product
 in
 Vietnam


into
 USDC
 and
 back
 and
 all
 around
 the


world?
 All
 these
 different
 payment


methods
 and
 payment
 instruments
 and
 the


actual
 secondary
 liquidity
 between
 those


and
 USDC
 is
 huge.
 And
 so
 the
 barrier
 to


entry
 is
 actually
 fairly
 high.
 We
 have


these
 large
 network
 modes
 and
 right
 now,


>> so
 it's
 not
 just
 like
 making
 a
 new


ERC20,


>> making
 a
 new
 coin.
 The
 marginal
 value
 of


a
 net
 new
 stable
 coin
 right
 now
 is


effectively
 zero.
 You
 have
 to
 have


established
 network
 utility
 and
 then


liquidity
 at
 scale.
 And
 essentially


liquidity
 begets
 liquidity.
 Network


velocity
 extends
 network
 velocity.
 And


so
 you
 know
 we
 feel
 like
 that's
 a
 very


very
 good
 position.
 And
 I
 think
 the


ability
 to
 be
 you
 know
 federally


regulated
 and
 to
 have
 these
 higher
 bars


on
 the
 infrastructure
 side
 and
 what's


required
 of
 you
 is
 is
 also
 really


important.
 That's
 not
 something
 for
 the


faint
 of
 heart.
 and
 doing
 that
 all


around
 the
 world,
 not
 just
 in
 the
 United


States.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 focus
 on
 the


United
 States,
 but
 we've
 been
 under


significant
 regulatory
 regimes
 in
 other


jurisdictions
 for
 for
 quite
 some
 time
 as


well.
 Those
 are,
 you
 know,
 meaningful


barriers.
 And
 I
 guess
 the
 bigger
 picture


there
 is
 like
 we're
 just
 focused
 on


building
 this
 infrastructure,
 making
 it


easy
 to
 adopt
 by
 whether
 it's
 a


technology
 company,
 a
 fintech
 company,
 a


bank.
 We're
 building
 partnerships
 with


some
 of
 the
 biggest
 core
 banking


infrastructure
 companies
 in
 the
 world.


We
 announced
 something
 recently
 with


Fiserve.
 Just
 yesterday,
 we
 announced
 a


broad
 partnership
 with
 FIS
 Global.
 And


these
 are
 companies
 that
 service
 tens
 of


thousands
 of
 banks.
 And
 we're
 plugging


USDC
 as
 a
 innovation
 into
 their


infrastructure.
 And
 so
 we
 even
 do
 it


with
 the
 card
 networks,
 Visa
 and


Mastercard,
 where
 they're
 using
 USDC
 as


an
 internal
 settlement
 system
 to
 move


money
 from
 issuers
 back
 to
 home
 base


faster
 than
 the
 correspondent
 banking


system.
 There's
 lots
 of
 places
 we're


getting
 integrated.
 And
 what
 I
 like
 to


say
 is
 I
 believe
 that
 the
 stable
 coin


stablecoin
 networks
 are
 a
 winner
 take


most
 not
 a
 winner
 take
 all
 market.


>> This
 was
 going
 to
 be
 my
 next
 question.


Can
 you
 talk
 about
 that
 a
 little
 bit


more
 like
 10
 years
 from
 now
 what
 is
 the


landscape
 actually
 look
 like
 and
 what
 is


the
 interoperability
 of
 all
 these


different
 stable
 coins
 actually
 look


like?


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 think
 10
 years
 from
 now
 I


don't
 think
 we
 have
 any
 idea
 what
 it's


what
 it's
 going
 to
 look
 like.
 But
 I
 mean


there
 there's
 several
 different


components.


>> Real
 forward-looking
 statement.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Several
 different
 components


to
 this.
 So
 I
 think
 one
 is
 we
 take
 as
 a


first
 principle
 that
 stablecoin
 money
 is


the
 highest
 utility
 form
 of
 money
 that's


ever
 been
 created.
 And
 it's
 it's
 the


highest
 utility
 not
 just
 because
 it
 has


internet
 superpowers
 of
 speed
 and
 it


cost
 efficiency
 but
 because
 it's


actually
 the
 first
 truly
 programmable


form
 of
 money.
 And
 if
 you're
 going
 to


have
 a
 programmable
 form
 of
 money
 where


software
 intermediation
 and
 software


innovation
 on
 top
 of
 money
 has
 not


existed,
 open
 banking
 is
 like
 poor


cousin.
 So
 you're
 introducing
 a
 new


realm
 of
 money
 utility
 and
 we're
 at
 the


very
 front
 edges
 of
 that.
 And
 we
 see


that
 already
 today.
 I
 mean
 the
 entire


phenomenon
 of
 DeFi,
 which
 is
 highly


sophisticated
 market
 structures
 that
 are


just


>> autonomous
 machines
 effectively
 running


in
 in
 code
 on
 the
 internet.
 That's


pretty
 amazing.
 So
 when
 you
 unleash
 that


and
 you
 unleash
 that
 kind
 of
 curve
 of


innovation,
 like
 it's
 sort
 of
 like
 when


mobile
 devices
 were
 out,
 people
 were


into
 mobile
 for
 a
 really
 long
 time
 and


they
 were
 like,
 "Hey,
 mobile's
 going to


be
 huge
 and
 Mobile
 World
 Congress
 was


like
 the
 biggest
 conference
 in
 the


world."
 And
 you'd
 go
 there
 and
 there's


like


100,000
 people
 there
 and
 and
 yet
 it
 all


sucked
 like
 like
 all
 the
 mobile
 phone


devices,
 everything
 was
 everything
 was


terrible,
 but
 everyone
 believed
 in


mobile.
 And
 then
 obviously
 the
 iPhone


came


>> and
 that
 was
 the
 end.


>> It
 wasn't
 the
 end.
 It
 was
 the
 beginning


is
 the
 point
 is
 that
 like
 actual


innovation
 with
 programmable
 apps
 on


phones
 actually
 started
 then
 in
 a
 real


way.


[Music]


I
 had
 a
 use
 case
 recently
 where
 I
 wanted


there
 to
 be
 a
 stable
 coin
 use
 case
 and
 I


think
 maybe
 this
 will
 coming.


>> So
 I've
 tried
 to
 do
 vibe
 coding
 where
 I


was
 like
 going
 on
 cursor
 and
 making


software
 and
 I
 wanted
 to
 link
 up
 my


software
 to
 chat
 GBT
 so
 that
 it
 could


query
 the
 AI.
 Yes.


>> And
 to
 access
 the
 API
 I
 had
 to
 like


enter
 in
 a
 credit
 card
 with
 GPT
 and
 then


I
 had
 to
 like
 copy
 and
 paste
 this
 code.


It
 was
 really
 annoying.
 And
 I
 was
 like


why
 can't
 I
 just
 have
 my
 cursor
 be


linked
 to
 a
 stable
 coin
 wallet?
 it
 make


the
 connection
 with
 Chad
 GBT's
 AI
 so


that
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 make
 an
 account
 and


it
 just
 pays
 per
 usage
 that
 is


intelligence


>> that
 is
 definitely
 what's
 going
 to


happen
 and
 in
 fact
 this
 is
 where
 I
 was


getting
 with
 my
 point
 actually
 in


response
 to
 you
 Tracy
 which
 is


>> like
 we
 think
 about
 the
 internet
 and


like
 when
 the
 marginal
 cost
 of
 storing


and
 moving
 information
 went
 to
 zero
 the


net
 world
 output
 of
 information
 like


millionxed
 or
 when
 software
 could
 be


distributed
 to
 a
 browser
 the
 net
 world


output
 of
 software
 was
 like
 up
 a


millionx
 so
 we
 create
 these
 huge
 growth


so
 my
 view
 is
 that
 over
 10
 years,
 we're


going
 to
 use
 your
 10-year,
 is
 that
 the


total
 payment
 volume,
 which
 is
 a
 measure


that
 people
 like
 to
 use,
 is
 likely
 going


to
 go
 up
 by
 many,
 many,
 many
 orders
 of


magnitude
 because
 you've
 taken
 that
 cost


and
 friction
 out
 and
 because
 of
 the
 new


utility
 that
 comes
 from
 programmability.


And
 so
 my
 own
 belief
 is
 that
 the
 scale


of
 money
 that
 moves
 in
 the
 world
 will
 be


so
 much
 larger
 than
 where
 we
 are
 today.


It's
 sort
 of
 the
 internet
 infrastructure


actually
 hitting
 the
 financial
 system


which
 is
 a
 scary
 thing
 because
 like
 wow


you've
 got
 all
 this
 money
 velocity
 and


you've
 got
 machines
 that
 are


intermediating
 this
 through
 AI
 like
 oh


my
 god
 that's
 one
 of the
 reasons
 why
 it


needs
 to
 be
 very
 safe
 full
 reserve


instruments
 but
 it
 also
 I
 think
 gets
 to


the
 heart
 of
 your
 question
 which
 is
 are


we
 going
 after
 all
 the
 deposits
 of
 the


banks
 or
 all
 this
 is
 the
 the
 answer
 is


no
 but
 my
 belief
 is
 that
 financial


institutions
 who
 create
 either
 places


where
 people
 can
 lend
 their
 money
 and


then
 that
 money
 can
 be
 used
 for
 other


investing
 purposes
 or
 where
 people


actually
 make
 specific
 investments
 with


their
 money
 like
 those
 will
 proliferate.


In
 fact,
 I
 think
 innovation
 in
 both


credit
 intermediation
 and
 in
 investable


assets
 is
 about
 to
 go
 through
 a
 new


renaissance
 because
 of
 blockchains,


tokenization
 and
 stable
 coins.
 And
 so
 my


own
 view
 is
 in
 a
 in
 a
 system
 of
 full


reserve
 money,
 you
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do


credit
 intermediation
 with
 that
 full


reserve
 money.
 And
 you
 need
 to
 make
 that


credit
 intermediation
 be
 as
 efficient
 as


possible.
 And
 I
 think
 you
 can
 build


onchain
 credit
 intermediation
 in
 a
 way


where
 you
 have
 greater
 safety,
 more


transparency,
 more
 auditable
 risk


management,
 and
 you
 can
 build
 market


structures
 that
 are
 far
 more
 accessible


to
 more
 people
 and
 institutions
 in
 the


world.
 I
 think
 of
 it
 as
 like
 Adwords
 for


credit
 like
 you
 know
 this
 sort
 of
 these


supercaled
 or
 or
 Amazon
 marketplace
 for


product
 creators.
 We
 haven't
 entered


that
 world
 yet
 but
 I
 think
 there
 will
 be


firms
 and
 that
 many
 of
 them
 will
 likely


be
 regulated
 by
 central
 banks
 who
 are


standing
 in
 that
 infrastructure.
 And
 so


it's
 an
 opportunity
 to
 reinvent
 what


payments,
 credit,
 investing,
 all
 these


things
 look
 like.
 Tracy,
 I
 kind
 of
 think


by
 the
 way,
 and
 we
 should
 maybe
 do
 a


separate,
 I
 think
 the
 internet
 as
 we


know
 it
 in
 terms
 of
 like
 internet
 that's


free
 to
 browse
 is
 probably
 going
 to
 die


because
 on
 a
 matter
 of
 time,
 you
 know,


if
 you're
 like
 AI
 bot
 can
 like
 go
 search


the
 web,
 those
 sites
 are
 going
 to
 want


payment
 for
 having
 all
 their
 data


scraped.
 And
 you
 know,
 stable
 coins


could
 solve
 that,
 but
 it
 does
 feel
 like


we're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 totally
 thing


where
 like
 you
 don't
 just
 get
 to
 use
 the


web
 for
 free.
 Everything
 is
 like
 metered


based
 on
 the
 uh
 the
 data
 that
 you're


pulling.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 that


earlier,
 right?
 This
 idea
 that
 we've


already
 seen
 traffic
 start
 to
 collapse


because
 the
 search
 engines
 are
 just


providing
 AI
 summaries
 to
 individual


pages.
 Yeah.
 How
 long
 are
 content


providers
 like
 uh
 like
 us?


>> How
 long
 are
 they
 going
 to
 stand
 for


that?
 I
 don't
 know.


>> Well,
 can
 I
 say
 something
 on
 that
 which


is
 we
 actually
 worked
 together
 with


Coinbase
 and
 a
 couple
 of
 others
 on


implementing
 some
 something
 called
 X42.


Now,
 you're
 like,
 what
 is
 that?
 And
 Mark


Andrees
 talks
 about
 this
 and
 he
 has
 over


the
 years
 back
 in
 the
 early
 days
 of
 the


web,
 you
 know.


>> Oh
 yeah,
 there
 you
 go.
 Actually,
 pay
 via


API
 without
 registration.
 That's
 what
 I


want.
 That's
 what
 I
 want
 for
 my
 V
 code.


So
 there
 exactly
 what
 I'm
 looking
 for.


>> So
 it's
 actually
 a
 it
 already
 exists
 as


a
 protocol
 that
 is
 built
 into


>> the
 way
 that
 every
 web
 server,
 every
 web


browser,
 every
 client
 that
 interacts


with
 the
 internet
 works.
 It's
 a
 protocol


that's
 there.
 It
 uses
 the
 existing
 HTTP


transport.
 And
 now
 you
 can
 actually
 say,


"Hey,
 I'm
 hitting
 my
 piece
 of
 content
 or


data."
 And
 I
 can
 challenge
 whoever's


accessing
 it
 and
 say,
 you
 know,
 to
 get


to
 this,
 you
 need
 to
 pay
 me.
 And
 it
 can


basically
 come
 back
 and
 say,
 you
 can
 pay


me
 on
 a
 blockchain
 with
 a
 stable
 coin.


>> And
 so
 we're
 doing
 that
 with
 USDC.
 We're


encouraging
 developers
 to
 do
 that.


There's
 lots
 of
 third
 parties
 that
 are


building
 layers
 for
 AI
 agents
 to
 use


this.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 one
 example,


but
 I
 think
 it
 gets
 to
 the
 heart
 of
 what


you're
 you're
 saying,
 which
 is
 there
 may


be
 more
 of
 a
 subscription
 model.
 Spotify


is
 probably
 the
 best
 example
 where
 you


have
 the
 celestial
 jukebox
 and
 you
 pay


your
 15
 bucks
 and
 you
 get
 access
 to


everything.
 You
 know,
 there's
 a
 kind
 of


question
 about
 could
 there
 be
 a


celestial
 data
 box
 which
 is
 more
 broad


and
 where
 the
 actual
 consumer
 frontends


are
 companies
 like
 OpenAI
 or
 Google
 and


you're
 paying
 a
 subscription
 and
 then


there's
 like
 a
 behind
 the
 scenes
 either


Pratta
 or
 usagebased
 model
 that
 is


actually
 compensating
 the
 actual
 data


providers
 and
 creators
 and
 so
 lots
 to
 be


unfold
 here.
 Yeah.


>> Can
 I
 ask
 a
 slightly
 awkward
 question?


>> It's
 a
 leading
 question.


>> How
 much
 do
 you
 hate
 Tether
 given
 that


not
 only
 are
 they
 number
 one,
 but
 you


know,
 there's
 been
 questions
 over
 their


reserve
 quality
 for
 many
 years,
 although


I
 think
 some
 of
 their
 transparency
 has


improved.


>> But
 thirdly,
 you
 know,
 we
 had
 the
 Tether


CEO
 on
 um
 a
 few
 months
 ago,
 and
 they're


expanding
 into
 the
 US.
 So
 that
 would


seem
 to,
 you
 know,
 directly
 be
 competing


with
 you
 on
 your
 sort
 of
 home
 turf,


although
 I
 understand
 you're
 also


expanding
 elsewhere
 in
 the
 world.
 How
 do


you
 feel
 about
 Tether?
 Yeah,
 I
 mean


look,
 I
 think
 our
 view
 has
 always
 been


that
 we're
 building
 for
 the
 long
 run
 and


we've
 taken
 a
 different
 approach
 really


since
 inception.
 We've
 taken
 a
 you
 know


a
 sort
 of
 regulatory
 first
 approach,
 a


compliance
 first
 approach,
 becoming


widely
 licensed,
 widely
 regulated,


always
 advocating
 to
 improve
 that.
 And


that's
 allowed
 us
 to
 build
 obviously


what
 we
 think
 is
 a
 great
 business.
 It's


allowed
 us
 to
 have
 deep
 integration
 into


the
 financial
 sector
 with
 banks.
 If


you're
 a
 major
 institution
 partnering
 in


this
 space,
 the
 probability
 of
 you
 doing


that
 with
 Circle
 is
 reasonably
 high.
 And


so
 we
 built
 a
 really
 great
 franchise
 and


we
 are
 really
 well
 known
 for
 integrity,


for
 trustworthiness.
 We're
 a
 publicly


traded
 company
 with
 the
 highest


standards
 of
 governance
 and
 and


accountability
 that
 are
 out
 there.
 And


we've
 always
 sought
 to
 uplevel
 that.
 And


so
 my
 view
 is
 that
 if
 we're
 building
 a


new
 internet
 financial
 system
 and
 that


new
 internet
 financial
 system
 is
 going


to
 be
 this
 incredibly
 broadly
 used


infrastructure
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 used


by
 like
 mainstream
 companies
 and
 public


companies
 and
 and
 financial
 institutions


and
 financial
 intermediaries
 all
 around


the
 world
 are
 going
 to
 integrate
 with


that
 and
 build
 on
 that.
 They're
 going
 to


want
 to
 do
 that
 with
 trusted
 well-


reggulated
 companies.
 And
 so
 our
 view
 is


that
 the
 early
 adopter
 segment
 of
 the


market
 which
 has
 really
 been
 dominated


by
 sort
 of
 the
 crypto
 trading
 side
 of


things
 is
 that
 early
 adopter
 segment.


We're
 now
 going
 into
 a
 different


chapter.
 And
 if
 you
 actually
 look
 at


over
 the
 last,
 you
 know,
 18
 months,


we've
 taken
 market
 share,
 we've
 taken,


you
 know,
 material
 market
 share
 and


we're
 growing
 in
 many,
 many
 areas.
 And
 I


would
 say
 also
 internationally,
 I
 would


say
 the
 majority
 of
 our
 business
 now
 is


international.
 So
 we're
 in
 many
 many


markets
 and
 in
 many
 other
 markets
 as


well
 the
 regulators
 are
 putting
 in
 place


very
 clear
 regulations
 around
 what


stable
 coin
 issuers
 need
 to
 be
 and
 so
 we


are
 the
 only
 large
 global
 dollar


stablecoin
 that's
 legally
 available
 in


Europe
 as
 an
 example
 and
 so
 I
 think
 we


just
 keep
 doing
 what
 we're
 doing
 I
 think


we're
 building
 great
 infrastructure
 for


companies
 for
 enterprises
 for
 developers


and
 we
 just
 got
 to
 keep
 doing
 that
 and


we'll
 grow
 and
 this
 is
 a
 really


significant
 size
 market
 and
 so
 I


actually
 you
 know
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of


respect
 for
 what
 they've
 been
 able
 to


build.
 We
 took
 a
 different
 path.
 We


built
 something
 also
 I
 think
 really


special
 and
 over
 5
 years
 10
 years
 as
 we


said
 earlier
 right
 this
 is
 very
 likely
 a


winner
 take
 most
 not
 a
 winner
 take
 all


market
 and
 I
 actually
 don't
 think
 we


know
 you
 know
 if
 there
 you
 know
 maybe


three
 or
 five
 big
 players
 I
 don't
 know


what
 that'll
 be
 in
 five
 years
 or
 10


years
 but
 there's
 probably
 some
 that


don't
 exist
 yet
 that
 that
 will
 show
 up


too.
 I
 take
 it
 as
 a
 sign
 of
 maturity.


Like
 years
 ago
 when
 it
 came
 to
 crypto,


people
 were
 just
 excited
 about
 number
 go


up,
 right?
 And
 then
 now
 it's
 like
 people


are
 really
 excited
 about
 number
 go


sideways.
 And
 so
 if
 it
 just
 stays
 at
 one


forever,
 that's
 like
 a
 really
 good
 sign.


And
 so
 I
 take
 it
 as
 a
 sign
 of
 maturity


for
 the
 industry
 that
 there
 is
 all
 this


interest
 in
 stable
 coins.
 Nonetheless,


>> no
 pun
 intended.


>> Nonetheless,
 you
 know,
 all
 those
 public


chains
 are
 still
 out
 there
 and
 USDC
 is


on
 a
 number
 of
 chains,


>> 24.
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 like
 who
 collects


the
 profits
 from
 this
 and
 we've
 talked


specifically
 about
 say
 your
 distribution


with
 Coinbase
 and
 whether
 that
 do
 you


see
 value
 acrewing
 to
 token
 holders
 of


different
 chains
 in
 the
 future
 because


it
 seems
 to
 me
 like
 for
 the
 most
 part
 as


long
 as
 it's
 like
 really
 fast
 and
 cheap.


It
 really
 doesn't
 matter
 if
 I'm
 sending


something
 to
 Tracy.
 I
 care
 about
 your


reputation
 and
 your
 money
 in
 the
 bank.
 I


don't
 really
 care
 about
 what
 chain
 that


you
 actually
 transact
 over
 at
 the
 end.


If
 you
 want
 to
 do
 it
 under
 Salana
 or


some
 layer
 three
 that
 gives
 almost
 no


value
 back
 to
 the
 ETH
 chain
 or
 something


like
 that,
 I
 don't
 really
 care.


>> Do
 you
 see
 like
 token
 holders
 of
 the


public
 chains
 collecting
 rents
 in
 your


future
 or
 collecting
 a
 meaningful
 amount


of
 rents
 from
 this
 onchain
 commerce?


>> It's
 a
 great
 question.
 I
 I'd
 say
 a


couple
 things
 and
 and
 I'm
 actually
 going


to
 relate
 back
 to
 my
 my
 mobile


commentary
 from
 earlier
 which
 is
 our


mental
 model
 is
 that
 blockchain
 networks


are
 internet
 operating
 systems
 and
 they


provide
 a
 way
 to
 store
 data
 conduct


transactions
 on
 that
 data
 and
 and


provide
 compute
 around
 those


transactions
 and
 data.
 That's
 what
 they


do.
 They're
 public
 computing
 machines


>> and
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 them.
 There's


actually,
 you
 know,
 thousands
 that
 have


been
 that
 have
 been
 launched.
 We're
 on


23
 or
 24
 today.
 And
 we
 see
 this
 as
 a


space
 that
 is
 constantly
 evolving.
 And


so
 there's
 constantly
 innovation
 on
 the


layer
 ones.
 There's
 these
 layer
 twos.


When
 I
 think
 about
 where
 we
 are
 relative


to
 where
 we
 were
 with
 say
 iPhone,
 we're


in
 the
 pre
 iPhone
 era
 of
 blockchain


networks
 in
 my
 view,
 right?
 I
 I
 think
 um


there's
 lots
 of
 operating
 systems
 out


there
 just
 like
 there
 were
 lots
 of


mobile
 operating
 systems


>> and
 some
 of
 them
 got
 better
 than
 others


and
 improved
 the
 user
 experience.
 Some


of
 them
 started
 enabling
 consumer


things.
 remember
 NT
 Docomo
 in
 Japan
 or


or
 things
 like
 that.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 that


we're
 still
 really
 early.
 And
 so
 that's


one
 of
 the
 reasons
 why
 we've,
 you
 know,


really
 tried
 to
 make
 sure
 we're
 trying


to
 operate
 our
 own
 stable
 coin
 network


on
 the
 best
 ones
 that
 are
 out
 there.


>> It
 just
 seems
 to
 me
 that
 decentralized


chains,
 you
 pay
 them
 a
 rent
 because
 you


want
 some
 advantage
 of
 decentralization.


If
 I'm
 using
 USDC,
 I've
 already
 accepted


the
 premise
 of
 centralization.
 You
 have


money
 in
 black
 the
 black
 rockck
 fund.


It's
 about
 it's
 about
 as
 centralized
 and


legacy
 fi
 as
 you
 could
 probably
 get
 once


I've
 already
 accepted
 this
 premise
 of


centralization
 that
 my
 money
 is
 just


backed
 by
 a
 bank.


Why
 do
 I
 even
 care?
 Why
 why
 pay
 these


rent
 to
 some
 network
 of
 computers?


>> So
 this
 is
 this
 is
 it's
 a
 different


layer
 is
 is
 essentially
 my
 thinking
 is


that
 public
 blockchains
 are
 a
 general


purpose
 layer
 that
 many
 many


applications
 can
 be
 built
 on
 top
 of.


Stable
 coins
 are
 the
 killer
 app
 for


sure.
 I
 will
 say
 in
 my
 own
 opinion,
 but


there
 are
 many
 many
 different
 kinds
 of


applications
 that
 can
 be
 built
 on
 that.


And
 we
 need
 innovation
 in
 those


computing
 platforms.
 We
 need
 higher


speed.
 We
 need
 greater
 privacy.
 We
 need


better
 forms
 of
 compute.
 We
 need
 new
 and


you
 know
 more
 primitives
 in
 that


infrastructure
 and
 that
 needs
 to
 expand.


We
 need
 to
 get
 to
 a
 point
 where
 these


public
 networks
 are
 supporting
 huge


scales
 of
 consumer
 applications
 and


enterprise
 applications.
 And
 so
 there's


like
 a
 a
 growth
 in
 that
 kind
 of


infrastructure
 side
 of
 it
 and
 that's


those
 are
 shared
 infrastructures
 that


many
 people
 can
 can
 take
 advantage
 of.


And
 so
 there
 needs
 to
 be
 a
 kind
 of
 fee


model
 on
 those
 networks.
 We've
 actually


created
 a
 way
 for
 the
 fees
 on
 many
 of


these
 blockchain
 networks
 to
 actually


just
 be
 paid
 in
 USDC.
 And
 so
 that's


something
 that
 we
 see
 more
 of
 happening


that
 like
 the
 notion
 of
 gas
 fees
 or
 the


notion
 of
 gas
 fees
 in
 some
 other
 crypto


commodity
 will
 will
 become
 less
 and
 less


common
 and
 like
 fees
 will
 just
 be
 paid


in
 in
 stablecoin.
 But
 I
 think
 there
 is


value
 in
 these
 networks
 and
 I
 think
 that


there's
 very
 likely
 value
 for
 token


holders
 on
 these
 networks
 if
 these


networks
 provide
 you
 know
 scalable


infrastructure
 that
 that
 people
 can
 take


advantage
 of.
 Again,
 stablecoin
 is
 one


application
 layer
 there
 and
 there'll
 be


many
 many
 other
 application
 layers
 on


those
 and
 and
 so
 you
 kind
 of
 pay
 for
 the


shared
 the
 shared
 state
 of
 the
 machine,


the
 shared
 data
 state,
 the
 shared


transaction
 state,
 the
 shared
 compute


state.
 There's
 value
 in
 paying
 for
 that


shared
 state.


>> Just
 on
 this
 note,
 can
 you
 tell
 us
 when


you're
 talking
 to
 clients
 or
 potential


partners
 like
 what
 is
 it
 that
 they
 are


most
 interested
 in
 getting
 from
 you?
 Can


you
 provide
 us
 with
 a
 sort
 of
 hierarchy


of
 needs
 for
 you
 know
 USDC
 customers
 in


the
 sense
 of
 are
 they
 worried
 about
 the


speed
 of
 the
 technology?
 Are
 they


worried
 about
 the
 reserve
 assets
 and
 I


guess
 corporate
 governance
 and
 things


like
 that?
 How
 would
 you
 prioritize
 what


people
 are
 actually
 thinking
 about?


Well,
 we
 have
 a
 huge
 range
 of
 types
 of


people
 that
 we
 work
 with
 from
 like


individual
 developers
 that
 are
 creating


a
 new
 product
 in
 some
 emerging
 market
 to


you
 know
 people
 building
 onchain


protocols
 to
 very
 large
 you
 know


financial
 institutions
 that
 are
 looking


at
 using
 this
 or
 integrating
 this
 in


different
 ways
 and
 so
 the
 things
 that


they
 you
 know
 care
 about
 do
 vary
 across


those
 but
 I
 would
 say
 trust
 transparency


liquidity
 are
 really
 really
 important
 to


everyone,
 right?
 If
 I'm
 a
 developer
 and


I'm
 building
 a
 product,
 I
 need
 to
 know


that
 this
 is
 a
 legitimate
 digital


dollar,
 that
 it's
 accessible
 in
 the


markets
 that
 I'm
 intending
 to
 serve,


that
 people
 can
 easily
 access
 it
 and
 use


it,
 and
 that
 the
 infrastructure
 is
 good.


I
 can
 build
 good
 product
 experiences.
 I


can
 build
 good
 user
 experiences
 and


build
 an
 application
 or
 or
 or
 something


for
 my
 own
 customers
 that
 works
 well.


And
 so
 they
 care
 about
 the
 developer


tooling,
 the
 onchain
 infra,
 the


liquidity,
 the
 trust.
 They
 care
 about


all
 those
 things
 as
 a
 startup.
 But
 even


a
 large
 company,
 say
 you're
 a
 big


fintech
 and
 you're
 like,
 "Hey,
 I
 want
 to


start
 leaning
 into
 this.
 I
 want
 to
 add


stable
 coins
 for
 payments
 or
 I
 want
 to


enable
 my
 customers
 to
 access
 DeFi
 or


other
 things
 like
 that."
 They're
 going


to
 care
 more
 about
 the
 kind
 of
 legal
 and


compliance
 status
 of
 Circle.
 they're


going
 to
 care
 about
 the
 governance
 of


the
 company
 itself,
 but
 also
 of
 the
 the


underlying
 regulation
 that
 affects
 us


because
 they
 have
 to
 face
 those
 same


issues
 whether
 they're
 in
 the


Philippines
 or
 in
 Brazil
 or
 in
 the


United
 States.
 So
 they
 care
 a
 lot
 about


those
 things
 and
 then
 they
 also
 care


about
 infra
 clearly
 like
 infrastructure


readiness.
 Is
 this
 something
 like
 I


could
 bring
 a
 large
 number
 of
 users
 to?


And
 then
 everyone
 cares
 about
 user


experience,
 right?
 Can
 I
 craft
 an


experience
 where
 the
 crypto
 disappears,


>> where
 I
 don't
 need
 to
 know
 what


blockchain
 am
 I
 on
 I'm
 on
 and
 I
 don't


need
 to
 know
 about
 gas
 fees
 and
 I
 I
 just


want
 to
 create
 a
 way
 for
 I
 have
 a
 I
 have


stored
 value.
 I
 want
 to
 enable
 people
 to


move
 it
 around
 really
 easily.
 They
 care


a
 lot
 about
 that
 whether
 you're
 the


biggest
 company
 in
 the
 world
 or
 or
 a


small
 startup.
 Jeremy
 Alert,
 thank
 you


so
 much
 for
 uh
 coming
 on.


>> Thank
 you.
 My
 pleasure.
 probably
 the


first
 crypto
 company
 I
 can
 think
 of
 that


actually
 tried
 to
 go
 through
 the


regulatory
 approach
 and
 didn't
 get


destroyed
 and
 bogged
 down
 in
 the


process.
 Very
 impressive
 and
 um
 yeah,


great
 chatting
 with
 you.


>> Thank
 you.


[Music]


Tracy,
 you
 know,
 one
 question
 I
 didn't


get
 to
 ask
 or
 I
 forgot
 to
 ask
 is
 like


the
 perennial
 like
 will
 I
 ever
 buy


coffee
 with
 a
 stable
 coin
 at
 some
 point?


Maybe
 I
 will,
 maybe
 I
 won't.
 But
 in
 the


conversation,
 I
 started
 thinking
 that's


probably
 the
 wrong
 way
 to
 think
 about


it.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 those


machineto-achine
 payments
 that
 if
 stable


coins
 become
 a
 real
 important
 payments


thing,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 like
 those
 like


computer
 to
 computer
 payments
 that
 have


to
 be
 seen,


>> right?
 And
 they're
 sort
 of
 plugged
 into


the
 inner
 workings
 of
 the
 internet.


Yeah,


>> that
 makes
 sense.


>> Maybe
 the
 coffee
 thing
 will
 happen.
 Who


knows?
 But
 like
 I
 don't
 know.


>> I
 don't
 find
 it
 that
 hard
 to
 buy
 a


coffee
 right
 now.


>> No,
 that's
 the
 thing.
 That's
 the


problem,
 right?
 Exactly.
 Coffee
 is


solying
 coffee
 is
 a
 solved
 problem
 as


far
 as
 I'm
 concerned.


>> Yes.
 But
 this
 is
 a
 new
 problem.
 You're


right.
 it
 could
 be
 solved.
 That's


interesting.
 The
 other
 thing
 I
 thought


was
 really
 interesting
 was
 you
 hit
 upon


the
 sort
 of
 tension
 in
 the


decentralization
 versus
 like
 traditional


finance
 and
 this
 idea
 that
 like
 okay


it's
 all
 about
 DeFi
 and
 blockchain
 and


all
 that
 stuff
 but
 ultimately
 like


>> Black
 Rockck
 is
 holding
 the
 money.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 totally.
 And
 this
 is
 like,
 you


know,
 it's
 it
 goes
 back
 to
 those


formative
 episodes
 we
 did
 with
 Austin


Campbell,
 which
 is
 a
 big
 part
 of
 the


story
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 this
 will
 be
 a


thing
 is
 like


>> just
 solving
 the
 sort
 of
 software


payments
 layer
 because
 we
 could
 do
 a


million
 episodes
 on
 legacy
 texts
 and
 why


JP
 Morgans
 or
 whatever
 companies


internal
 software
 will
 always
 be
 they'll


be
 spending
 billions
 of
 dollars


upgrading
 it,
 whatever
 it
 is,
 and
 the


difficulty
 of
 integrations.
 But
 if
 you


could
 just
 have
 like
 a
 oneoff
 like
 so


like
 global
 platform
 that
 anyone
 can


plug
 into
 and
 program
 where
 money
 can


easily
 be
 transmitted
 that's
 very


powerful.


>> Yeah.
 This
 is
 why
 I
 say
 user
 interface


user
 experience
 is
 underrated.
 Right.


That's
 like
 me
 saying
 Michael
 Jordan
 is


underrated.
 It's
 but
 like
 that
 really


that
 really
 is
 it
 right?
 Like
 that's


where
 the
 battleground
 kind
 of
 is
 the


ability
 to
 like
 plug
 in
 and
 interoperate


with
 all
 these
 different
 systems.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I'm
 really
 excited.
 I
 I


think
 um
 we
 should
 have
 uh
 Jeremy
 back


at
 some
 point.


>> Yeah,
 we
 should.
 All right.
 Shall
 we


leave
 it
 there
