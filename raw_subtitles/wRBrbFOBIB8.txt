From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Michael


Bubaro.
 This
 is
 the
 daily.


Today,
 in
 President
 Trump's
 first
 State


of
 the
 Union
 of
 his
 second
 term,
 he


offered
 a
 rosy
 portrait
 of
 a
 country


that
 has
 lost
 confidence
 in
 his


leadership
 and
 relentlessly
 baited


Democrats
 as
 they
 try
 to
 win
 back


control
 of
 Congress
 this
 fall.


My
 colleague,
 Chief
 Washington


correspondent
 David
 Sanger,
 takes
 us


inside
 the
 room.


It's
 Wednesday,
 February
 25th.


David,
 good
 evening.


>> Hey,
 Michael.
 We're
 back
 again.


>> We're
 back
 again.
 This
 is
 your
 second


episode,
 I
 think,
 in
 2
 days.
 Uh,
 it's


about
 11:30
 p.m.
 on
 Tuesday
 night,
 and


the
 president
 just
 wrapped
 his
 State
 of


the
 Union
 address,
 and
 it
 was
 a
 very


long
 State
 of
 the
 Union
 address.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 It
 was
 an
 hour
 and
 47
 minutes.


You
 know,
 for
 years,
 we
 thought
 that


Bill
 Clinton
 set
 the
 record
 at
 99


minutes,
 right?
 And
 people
 couldn't


believe
 how
 verbose
 he
 was.
 But
 Donald


Trump
 has
 shown
 consistently
 he
 can
 go


longer.


>> And
 he
 did
 go
 longer.
 This
 was
 the


longest
 by
 New
 York
 Times
 calculations


state
 of
 the
 union
 in
 history.


>> Yep.


>> Well,
 David,
 as
 you
 know
 well,
 every


State
 of
 the
 Union,
 no matter
 its


length,
 feels
 deeply
 grounded
 in
 the


moment
 in
 which
 it
 is
 delivered.
 And
 I


want
 to
 start
 there
 with
 you
 with
 the


stakes
 of
 this
 speech
 for
 President


Trump
 as
 we
 went
 into
 this
 speech
 on


Tuesday
 night.


>> Well,
 he
 had
 a
 lot
 to
 get
 done
 because
 a


year
 ago,
 he
 was
 coming
 in
 fresh
 from
 a


big
 electoral
 victory.


People
 were
 kind
 of
 tired
 of
 the
 Biden


years.


Now,
 he
 came
 into
 this
 one
 with
 polls


showing
 that
 voters
 have
 turned
 on


President
 Trump
 pretty
 severely.


that
 more
 than
 60%
 are
 saying
 that
 his


priorities
 are
 not
 their
 priorities.


They're
 concerned
 about
 affordability


and
 inflation.


They're
 worried
 about
 tariffs
 and
 were
 a


little
 bit
 relieved
 when
 the
 Supreme


Court
 seemed
 to
 step
 in
 and
 say
 the


president
 overstepped
 his
 authority.


They're
 concerned
 that
 we've
 put
 a
 good


percentage
 of
 our
 navy
 and
 air
 force
 off


the
 coast
 of
 Iran
 for
 what
 may
 be
 an


invasion
 that
 people
 are
 still
 pretty


apprehensive
 about.


And
 there's
 a
 midterm
 election
 looming


and
 a
 lot
 of
 very
 nervous
 Republicans


who
 have
 backed
 President
 Trump
 sitting


in
 that
 audience
 worried
 about
 what
 it


is
 that
 they'll
 be
 stuck
 with
 come


November.
 So
 he
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 hurdles
 to


go
 across
 tonight.


>> Right.
 I
 would
 say
 that
 an
 economy


Americans
 are
 extremely
 anxious
 about
 a


tinderbox
 potential
 war
 in
 the
 Middle


East,
 a
 tariff
 ruling
 that
 went
 against


him.
 All
 in
 an
 election
 year
 makes
 for


about
 as
 high
 stakes
 a
 State
 of
 the


Union
 as
 you
 can
 really
 imagine.


So
 take
 us
 into
 the
 room
 as
 this
 speech


gets
 underway.


>> Mr.
 Speaker,
 the
 President
 of
 the
 United


States.


So
 the
 president
 walked
 in
 with
 the


usual
 introductions,
 each
 one
 of
 which


leads
 to
 a
 burst
 of
 applause.


>> There
 are
 protests
 among
 some
 of
 the


Democrats.


>> But
 you
 know,
 he
 immediately
 diffused


the
 big
 issue
 which
 was
 how
 would
 he


deal
 with
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 that
 he
 had


denounced
 as
 unpatriotic


just
 days
 before.


>> Right?


and
 he
 went
 up
 and
 shook
 the
 hands
 of
 a


couple
 of
 the
 justices,
 the
 ones
 who
 he


said
 a
 few
 days
 ago
 their
 families
 would


be
 ashamed
 of
 them.


>> Well,
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 everybody.


It's
 really
 an
 honor.


>> And
 then
 after
 that
 brief
 moment
 of


surprise
 diplomacy,
 he
 takes
 to
 the


podium.


Less
 than
 five
 months
 from
 now,
 our


country
 will
 celebrate
 an
 epic
 milestone


in
 American
 history,
 the
 250th


anniversary
 of
 our
 glorious
 American


independence.


>> He
 does.
 And
 you
 know,
 he
 opens
 up
 with


an
 immediate
 reference
 to
 the
 250th


anniversary
 of
 the
 United
 States.
 This


July
 4th,
 we
 will
 mark
 two
 and
 a
 half


centuries
 of
 liberty
 and
 triumph,


progress
 and
 freedom
 in
 the
 most


incredible
 and
 exceptional
 nation
 ever


to
 exist
 on
 the
 face
 of
 the
 earth.
 And


you've
 seen
 nothing
 yet.
 We're
 going
 to


do
 better
 and
 better
 and
 better.
 This
 is


the
 golden
 age
 of
 America.
 And
 I
 thought


for
 a
 minute
 there,
 well,
 he's
 going
 to


really
 go
 do
 a
 unifying
 speech
 here


built
 around
 that
 theme.


>> The
 theme
 of
 a
 country
 that
 was
 in
 the


throws
 of
 revolution,
 has
 had
 divisions


before
 and
 came
 together.


>> When
 I
 last
 spoke
 in
 this
 chamber
 12


months
 ago,
 I
 had
 just
 inherited
 a


nation
 in
 crisis
 with
 a
 stagnant


economy,
 inflation
 at
 record
 levels,
 a


wide
 open
 border.
 It's
 not
 quite
 what
 we


got.


>> Rampid
 crime
 at
 home
 and
 wars
 and
 chaos


all
 over
 the
 world.


>> And
 then
 he
 launched
 into
 what
 turned


out
 to
 be
 a
 play
 in
 three
 parts.
 Right.


The
 first
 part
 was
 a
 familiar
 recitation


of
 what
 he
 thinks
 his
 accomplishments


were.
 The
 middle
 was
 a
 highly
 partisan


attack
 on
 Democrats
 and
 the
 end
 was
 sort


of
 a
 return
 to
 these
 unifying
 themes.


It's
 the
 250th
 anniversary.
 War
 heroes,


an
 America
 that
 can
 do
 anything
 it
 wants


to
 do.


>> Okay.
 Well,
 let's
 start
 with
 the
 first


of
 those,
 Trump's
 accomplishments.
 In


his
 telling,


>> well,
 in
 his
 telling,
 America
 has
 come


back
 from
 being
 basically
 dead
 on


arrival
 in
 the
 emergency
 room.
 But


tonight,
 after
 just
 one
 year,
 I
 can
 say


with
 dignity
 and
 pride
 that
 we
 have


achieved
 a
 transformation
 like
 no
 one


has
 ever
 seen
 before
 and
 a
 turnaround


for
 the
 ages.
 It
 is
 indeed
 a
 turnaround


for
 the
 ages.


And
 not
 surprisingly,
 Michael,
 he
 ran


through
 a
 number
 of
 inflated
 claims
 that


are
 pretty
 familiar
 to
 anybody
 who


listens
 to
 Donald
 Trump
 at
 rallies
 or
 at


press
 conferences.
 The
 roaring
 economy


is
 roaring
 like
 never
 before.


>> He
 talked
 about
 economic
 growth


>> and
 100%
 of
 all
 jobs
 created
 under
 my


administration
 have
 been
 in
 the
 private


sector.


>> He
 talked
 about
 how
 many
 jobs
 were


created
 in
 the
 private
 sector
 without


mentioning
 the
 fact
 that
 Doge
 cut
 many


in
 the
 public
 sector
 and
 overall
 job


growth
 is
 pretty
 low.
 He
 talked
 about


winning,
 particularly
 winning
 new


investment
 in
 the
 United
 States.


>> In
 12
 months,
 I
 secured
 commitments
 for


more
 than
 $18
 trillion
 pouring
 in
 from


all
 over
 the
 globe.


>> Well,
 nothing
 close
 to
 that
 has
 come
 in


in
 the
 past
 year.
 It
 looks
 like
 he
 is


adding
 together
 and
 maybe
 inflating


commitments
 that
 came
 from
 different


chief
 executives
 talking
 about
 their


investment
 over
 the
 next
 decade
 or
 two.


And
 most
 importantly,


>> months,
 my
 administration
 has
 driven


core
 inflation
 down
 to
 the
 lowest
 level


in
 more
 than
 five
 years.
 And
 in
 the
 last


three
 months
 of
 2025,
 it
 was
 down
 to


1.7%.


>> He
 made
 his
 case
 that
 inflation
 was


finally
 under
 control.
 And
 that
 was
 the


closest
 he
 got
 to
 the
 affordability


argument
 that
 we
 know
 he
 hates
 making


because
 he
 thinks
 it's
 a
 nonsense


argument,
 but
 that
 every
 one
 of
 his
 aids


tells
 him
 he's
 got
 to
 address.
 It's
 the


one
 thing
 that
 the
 polls
 show
 anger


Americans
 of
 all
 stripes.


>> A
 short
 time
 ago,
 we
 were
 a
 dead


country.
 Now,
 we
 are
 the
 hottest
 country


anywhere
 in
 the
 world.
 The
 hottest.


What
 was
 really
 striking
 about
 this
 was


if
 you
 compare
 his
 claims
 to
 the
 way


people
 feel,
 what
 they
 tell
 pollsters,


>> there
 was
 an
 element
 of
 unreality
 to


this.


>> One
 of
 the
 primary
 reasons
 for
 our


country's
 stunning
 economic
 turnaround,


the
 biggest
 in
 history
 where
 the
 Dow


Jones
 broke
 50,000
 four
 years
 ahead
 of


schedule
 and
 the
 S&P
 hit
 7,000
 where
 it


wasn't
 supposed
 to
 do
 it
 for
 many
 years.


were
 tariffs.


>> And
 it's
 around
 this
 point,
 David,
 that


Trump
 formally
 turns
 to
 a
 subject
 we


knew
 he
 would
 need
 to
 address,


>> the
 tariff
 ruling
 by
 the
 Supreme
 Court


justices.
 Like
 you
 said,
 he
 had
 shaken


their
 hands
 as
 he
 walked
 in,
 but
 then
 it


seemed
 like
 he
 kind
 of
 unshook
 their


hands
 in
 the
 actual
 speech.


>> And
 then
 just
 four
 days
 ago,
 an


unfortunate
 ruling
 from
 the
 United


States
 Supreme
 Court.
 It
 just
 came
 down.


It
 came
 down.
 Very
 unfortunate
 ruling.


Well,
 I
 actually
 thought,
 Michael,
 that


compared
 to
 what
 he
 said
 last
 week
 when


he
 was
 making
 specific
 accusations


against
 the
 individual
 justices
 who
 had


ruled
 against
 him,


>> he
 was
 pretty
 moderate.


>> So
 despite
 the
 disappointing
 ruling,


these
 powerful
 country
 saving,
 it's


saving
 our
 country
 the
 kind
 of
 money


we're
 taking
 in.


>> But
 this
 didn't
 last
 long.


>> Congressional
 action
 will
 not
 be


necessary.
 it's
 already
 time-t
 tested


and
 approved.


>> And
 he
 basically
 made
 the
 argument,
 I'm


going
 to
 reimpose
 all
 of
 those
 tariffs


under
 different
 authorities.
 And
 he


moved
 on.


>> Moving
 forward,
 factories,
 jobs,


investment,
 and
 trillions
 and
 trillions,


>> right?
 I
 did
 think
 it
 was
 notable
 that


the
 president
 when
 he
 said
 he
 was
 going


to
 reimpose
 the
 tariffs


said
 he
 didn't
 feel
 like
 he
 needed


congressional
 action
 to
 do
 that
 because


the
 context
 of
 course
 is
 that
 he's
 in
 a


room
 filled
 with
 members
 of
 Congress
 who


in
 theory
 should
 covet
 the
 ability
 to


influence
 this
 decision.
 The
 Supreme


Court
 said
 it's
 their
 job,
 not
 the


president's.
 And
 instead
 the
 president


looks
 at
 all
 these
 members
 of
 Congress


and
 basically
 says,
 "I
 don't
 need
 you.


I'm
 going
 to
 do
 this
 anyway.


You
 know,
 that's
 a
 theme
 throughout
 his


presidency.
 This
 is
 not
 a
 president
 who


wakes
 up
 in
 the
 morning
 and
 thinks
 about


bills
 he's
 going
 to
 go
 push
 through


Congress.
 This
 is
 a
 president
 who
 wakes


up
 in
 the
 morning
 and
 thinks
 about
 what


authorities
 he
 has
 or
 can
 claim
 to
 have


so
 that
 he
 can
 do
 things
 by
 executive


order.


>> Because
 we
 finally
 have
 a
 president
 who


puts
 America
 first.
 I
 put
 America
 first.


I
 love
 America.
 And
 then
 the
 president


turns
 to
 what
 David
 you
 have
 termed
 the


second
 act
 of
 this
 speech,
 the
 partisan


act.


>> For
 decades
 before
 I
 came
 along,


we
 had
 the
 exact
 opposite.


>> Especially
 as
 he
 turns
 to
 the
 topic
 of


immigration.
 Well,
 you
 know,
 Michael,
 if


you
 think
 that
 the
 first
 part
 was
 sort


of
 delivered
 by
 the
 good
 Donald
 Trump,


the
 one
 who
 seemed
 sort
 of
 jovial,
 the


tone
 changed
 as
 soon
 as
 he
 got
 into
 this


middle
 section.
 Under
 Biden
 and
 his


corrupt
 partners
 in
 Congress
 and
 beyond.


It
 reached
 a
 breaking
 point
 with
 the


Green
 New
 Scam,
 open
 borders
 for


everyone.
 They
 poured
 in
 by
 the
 millions


and
 millions
 from
 prisons,
 from
 mental


institutions.
 they
 were
 murdered.


>> He
 immediately
 goes
 into
 setting
 up
 this


kind
 of
 rhetorical
 motif
 in
 which
 he


attacks
 Democratic
 cities
 and
 he
 begins


to
 run
 through
 his
 now
 familiar
 list
 of


ills
 he
 thinks
 Democrats
 have
 brought
 to


the
 United
 States.
 But
 when
 it
 comes
 to


the
 corruption
 that
 is
 plundering
 really


it's
 plundering
 America,
 there's
 been
 no


more
 stunning
 example
 than
 Minnesota.


>> So
 he
 blamed
 the
 Somali
 in
 Minnesota
 for


fraud.


>> This
 is
 the
 kind
 of
 corruption
 that


shreds
 the
 fabric
 of
 a
 nation
 and
 we
 are


working
 on
 it
 like
 you
 wouldn't
 believe.


>> He
 went
 after
 sanctuary
 cities.
 He


defined
 his
 immigration
 effort
 as
 an


effort
 to
 get
 the
 worst
 of
 the
 worst


out.


>> And
 we're
 getting
 them
 the
 hell
 out
 of


here
 fast.
 We
 don't
 want
 them.


>> Skimming
 over
 right
 away
 others
 with
 no


criminal
 record
 who
 have
 been
 deported


and
 of
 course
 the
 shootings
 of
 two


American
 citizens
 in
 Minneapolis.


>> The
 only
 thing
 standing
 between


Americans
 and
 a
 wide
 open
 border
 right


now
 is
 President
 Donald
 J.
 Trump
 and
 our


great
 Republican
 patriots
 in
 Congress.


Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.


>> Right.
 It
 kind
 of
 felt
 like
 he
 was


trying
 to
 reclaim
 the
 topic
 of


immigration,
 which
 has
 gone
 from
 being
 a


strength
 into
 being
 a
 vulnerability
 for


him.
 But
 in
 the
 process,
 he
 did
 not


represent
 what's
 actually
 unfolded
 under


his
 leadership.


>> But
 he
 had
 a
 deeper
 goal
 here,
 which
 was


to
 set
 up
 the
 Democrats,
 who
 of
 course


were
 sitting
 on
 their
 hands
 while
 the


Republicans
 were
 applauding
 each
 one
 of


these.
 One
 of
 the
 great
 things
 about
 the


state
 of
 the
 union
 is
 how
 it
 gives


Americans
 the
 chance
 to
 see
 clearly
 what


their
 representatives
 really
 believe.


>> And
 then
 at
 one
 point
 after
 he
 has
 built


up
 to
 this
 crescendo.


>> So
 tonight
 I'm
 inviting
 every


legislature
 to
 join
 with
 my


administration
 in
 reaffirming
 a


fundamental
 principle.
 If
 you
 agree
 with


this
 statement
 then
 stand
 up
 and
 show


your
 support.
 The
 first
 duty
 of
 the


American
 government
 is
 to
 protect


American
 citizens,
 not
 illegal
 aliens.


>> He
 asks
 everyone
 to
 stand
 if
 they
 agree


with
 him.


>> Mhm.


>> Knowing
 that
 he
 would
 get
 the
 image
 of


Republicans
 who
 are
 standing
 and


Democrats
 who
 remain
 sitting.


>> Isn't
 that
 a
 shame?
 You
 should
 be


ashamed
 of
 yourself
 not
 standing
 up.
 You


should
 be
 ashamed
 of
 yourself.


So
 if
 you
 ever
 wanted
 a
 moment
 where
 you


could
 sort
 of
 capture
 the
 division


between
 the
 Trump
 Republicans
 and
 the


Democrats,


President
 Trump
 was
 creating
 it
 right


there
 for
 the
 cameras.
 And
 then


eventually
 the
 Democrats
 take
 the
 bait


>> to
 end
 deadly
 sanctuary
 cities
 that


protect
 the
 criminals
 and
 enact
 serious


penalties
 for
 public
 officials
 who
 block


the
 removal
 of
 criminal
 aliens.
 in
 many


cases,
 drug
 lords.


>> And
 not
 surprisingly,
 Representative


Ilhan
 Omar,
 who
 he
 has
 attacked


repeatedly,
 begins
 yelling
 at
 him,
 and


he
 has
 a
 few
 exchanges
 with
 her.


>> Right.
 At
 one
 point,
 she
 says,
 "You


killed
 American
 citizens."
 She
 wants
 to


distinguish
 between
 what
 he's
 arguing,


which
 is
 there's
 a
 problem
 with
 illegal


immigration,
 and
 what
 she
 says
 is
 the


problem,
 which
 is
 you
 guys
 are
 so


overzealous
 that
 you're
 hurting
 American


citizens.


>> Right?
 This
 was
 exactly
 the
 contrast


that
 I
 think
 President
 Trump
 wanted
 to


bring
 up.
 This
 was
 the
 moment
 he
 wanted


for
 the
 cameras
 because
 what
 he
 was


building
 toward
 once
 the
 yelling
 laid


down
 was
 this
 one
 line
 that
 may
 remain


as
 the
 one
 that
 people
 remember
 from
 the


speech.


>> These
 people
 are
 crazy.
 I'm
 telling
 you,


they're
 crazy.


>> These
 people
 are
 crazy.
 I'm
 telling
 you.


And
 of
 course,
 he's
 thinking
 of
 that
 as


the
 theme
 for
 the
 midterm
 elections,


>> right?
 Instead
 of
 trying
 to
 justify
 all


of
 his
 administration's
 conduct
 in


places
 like
 Minneapolis,
 for
 example,


where
 ICE
 enforcement
 has
 become
 a
 real


liability
 for
 him.
 He
 is
 attempting
 to


turn
 this
 around
 and
 make
 it
 a
 liability


for
 Democrats.
 It's
 deeply
 unclear


whether
 that
 will
 work,
 but
 he's
 saying


they
 remain
 out
 of
 the
 mainstream.
 This


is
 not
 about
 me.
 This
 is
 about
 them
 in


an
 election
 year.
 That's
 right,
 Michael.


But
 it's
 also
 where
 the
 disconnect
 shows


up
 again
 because
 polls
 will
 show
 that


Americans
 are
 largely
 sympathetic
 with


the
 idea
 of
 throwing
 out
 illegal


immigrants
 who
 are
 violent,
 who
 have


criminal
 records,
 and
 so
 forth.
 It


tapers
 off
 pretty
 fast
 when
 you
 have


people
 who've
 been
 in
 the
 United
 States


for
 a
 long
 time,
 no
 criminal
 record,


built
 their
 own
 businesses
 or
 students


or
 something
 like
 that.
 And
 it


completely
 falls
 off
 when
 you
 ask
 about


the
 ICE
 enforcement
 activity
 that
 we've


seen
 take
 place,
 including
 the
 killings


of
 American
 citizens.
 And
 the
 way
 he


dealt
 with
 the
 last
 was
 simply
 not
 to


mention
 it.


Okay,
 David,
 we're
 going to
 take
 a
 quick


break.
 When
 we
 come
 back,
 we're
 going
 to


talk
 about
 how
 the
 president
 eventually


gets
 to
 that
 third
 act
 of
 this
 speech
 by


way
 of
 a
 journey
 through
 foreign


affairs.
 So,
 we'll
 be
 right
 back.


We're
 proudly
 restoring
 safety
 for


Americans
 at
 home
 and
 we
 are
 also


restoring
 security
 for
 Americans
 abroad.


>> So
 David,
 about
 an
 hour
 into
 this


speech,
 President
 Trump
 turns
 to


international
 affairs
 and
 his
 role
 in


bringing
 about
 the
 end
 to
 a
 whole
 lot
 of


conflicts
 as
 he
 puts
 it.
 Well,
 yes,


that's
 right,
 Michael,
 because


>> our
 country
 has
 never
 been
 stronger.
 My


first
 10
 months,
 I
 ended
 eight
 wars,


including,


>> of
 course,
 he
 repeats
 the
 somewhat


dubious
 claim
 that
 he
 has


single-handedly
 ended
 eight
 wars.
 There


are
 a
 couple
 he
 can
 take
 credit
 for,
 but


what's
 important
 here
 is
 the
 Democrats


kind
 of
 laughed
 at
 him.


They're


>> sick
 people.


>> And
 the
 Republicans
 all
 applauded
 him
 on


it.


He
 then
 turned
 to
 what
 was
 clearly
 his


biggest
 success.


>> Under
 the
 ceasefire
 I
 negotiated,
 every


single
 hostage,
 both
 living
 and
 dead,


has
 been
 returned
 home.
 Can
 you
 believe


that?


>> He
 talked
 about
 the
 agreement
 that


brought
 all
 the
 hostages,
 living
 and


dead,
 out
 of
 the
 hands
 of
 Hamas.
 That


was
 a
 truly
 remarkable
 accomplishment.


>> Nobody
 thought
 it
 was
 possible.
 and
 then


overstated
 the
 ceasefire
 that
 has


followed,
 which
 has
 been
 pretty
 rocky.


>> Mhm.


>> Then
 he
 just
 glided
 by
 what
 four
 years


ago
 was
 the
 dominant
 subject
 of
 the


State
 of
 the
 Union.


>> And
 we're
 working
 very
 hard
 to
 end
 the


ninth
 war,
 the
 killing
 and
 slaughter


between
 Russia
 and
 Ukraine,
 where
 25,000


soldiers
 are
 dying
 each
 and
 every
 month.


the
 Russian
 invasion
 of
 Ukraine,
 which


happened
 four
 years
 to
 the
 day
 before


this
 speech.


>> A
 war
 which
 would
 have
 never
 happened
 if


I
 were
 president.
 Would
 have
 never


happened.


And
 while
 President
 Biden
 was
 out
 there


four
 years
 ago
 getting
 bipartisan


applause
 for
 his
 promise
 to
 stick
 with


Ukraine
 thick
 and
 thin,
 in
 this
 case,


the
 president
 simply
 said
 he's
 working


on
 it,
 that
 there
 have
 been
 awful


casualties
 and
 he
 just
 wants
 to
 bring


the
 war
 to
 an
 end.


>> Right?
 He
 steadfastly
 refused
 to
 offer


any
 real
 support
 to
 Ukraine,


>> which
 was
 the
 one
 thing
 the
 Ukrainians


were
 looking
 for
 today
 on
 the
 4th


anniversary.


Just
 the
 message
 that
 we're
 with
 you.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 they
 didn't
 get
 it.


>> As
 president,
 I
 will
 make
 peace
 wherever


I
 can,
 but
 I
 will
 never
 hesitate
 to


confront
 threats
 to
 America
 wherever
 we


must.
 And
 then
 the
 president
 pivots
 to


the
 international
 subject
 that
 all
 of
 us


were
 wondering
 whether
 he
 would
 get
 to


and
 if
 he
 got
 to
 it
 how
 thoroughly
 he


would
 broach
 it,
 which
 is
 Iran.


>> For
 decades,
 it
 had
 been
 the
 policy
 of


the
 United
 States
 never
 to
 allow
 Iran
 to


obtain
 a
 nuclear
 weapon.
 Many
 decades.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 I'd
 say
 this
 was
 in


some
 ways
 the
 lost
 opportunity
 of
 the


speech.
 Hm.
 Just
 explain
 that.


>> Well,
 he
 brushed
 by
 the
 topic
 of
 Iran
 so


quickly
 that
 if
 you
 were
 a
 casual


listener,
 you
 would
 never
 have
 known


that
 we've
 got
 something
 like
 a
 third
 of


the
 US
 Navy
 and
 a
 good
 deal
 of
 the


American
 air
 power
 that's
 available


around
 the
 globe
 parked
 off
 the
 Middle


East
 and
 that
 within
 a
 few
 days
 we
 could


well
 be
 in
 a
 situation
 where
 we're
 in
 an


enduring
 conflict
 with
 Iran.
 They
 were


warned
 to
 make
 no
 future
 attempts
 to


rebuild
 their
 weapons
 program
 in


particular
 nuclear
 weapons.
 Yet
 they


continue


starting
 it
 all
 over.
 We
 wiped
 it
 out


and
 they
 want
 to
 start
 all
 over
 again.


>> So
 he
 ran
 through
 Iran's
 offenses
 over


the
 many
 years.
 He
 raised
 the


possibility
 that
 they
 were
 trying
 to


reconstitute
 their
 nuclear
 program,


which
 was
 pretty
 remarkable
 because


eight
 months
 ago,
 he
 was
 saying
 he


obliterated
 the
 nuclear
 program
 and
 they


wouldn't
 be
 able
 to
 restart
 it
 for


years.


>> Right.
 In
 a
 previous
 attack.


>> That's
 right.
 That
 was
 in
 the
 June


attack
 on
 the
 three
 major
 enrichment


sites.
 They've
 already
 developed


missiles
 that
 can
 threaten
 Europe
 and


our
 bases
 overseas,
 and
 they're
 working


to
 build
 missiles
 that
 will
 soon
 reach


the
 United
 States
 of
 America.
 He
 talked


about
 their
 missile
 developments.
 He


talked
 about
 32,000
 Iranian
 protesters


who
 had
 been
 killed
 during
 the
 uprisings


last
 month.


>> We
 stopped
 them
 from
 hanging
 a
 lot
 of


them
 with
 the
 threat
 of
 serious


violence.
 But
 this,


>> but
 what
 was
 strange
 about
 this,


Michael,
 was
 he
 never
 used
 the
 moment
 to


explain
 what
 he
 was
 trying
 to
 accomplish


with
 all
 of
 that
 military
 firepower


sitting
 off
 of
 Iran?
 Was
 he
 trying
 to


stop
 the
 nuclear
 program
 or
 overthrow


the
 regime
 or
 protect
 the
 protesters?
 He


simply
 did
 not
 say.
 And
 that's
 the
 one


thing
 that
 everybody
 was
 listening
 for


the
 most.
 He
 said
 the
 Iranians
 had
 not


given
 him
 the
 one
 thing
 he
 wanted
 to


hear


>> with
 him.
 They
 want
 to
 make
 a
 deal,
 but


we
 haven't
 heard
 those
 secret
 words.
 We


will
 never
 have
 a
 nuclear
 weapon.


>> We
 will
 never
 have
 a
 nuclear
 weapon.


Well,
 of
 course,
 the
 Iranians
 have
 said


that
 many
 times.
 In
 fact,
 their
 foreign


minister
 tweeted
 it
 out
 a
 few
 hours


before
 the
 speech.
 But
 the
 problem
 isn't


what
 the
 Iranians
 say.
 It's
 what
 they've


been
 caught
 doing
 at
 various
 points
 over


the
 past
 few
 years.


>> I
 have
 to
 say,
 David,
 I
 had
 a
 slightly


different
 reaction
 to
 hearing
 this


section
 of
 the
 speech,
 and
 I
 almost


never
 differ
 with
 you,
 but
 I
 heard
 what


felt
 like
 a
 all
 the
 above
 rationale
 from


the
 president
 in
 stating
 his
 disgust


with
 Iran.
 And
 taken
 together,
 it
 did


feel
 like
 the
 beginning
 of
 a
 rationale


for
 military
 action
 against
 Iran.


>> He
 came
 up
 with
 a
 cause
 of
 spell
 or


actually
 four
 or
 five.


>> Mhm.


>> But
 he
 never
 told
 us
 how
 the
 application


of
 military
 power,
 how
 bombing
 the


Iranians
 would
 change
 this.
 And
 as
 we've


talked
 about
 before,


>> you
 know,
 you
 might
 be
 able
 to
 destroy


some
 facilities,
 but
 it's
 not
 clear
 how


you
 protect
 protesters,
 for
 example,
 by


dropping
 bombs
 in.


>> We're
 also
 restoring
 American
 security


and
 dominance
 in
 the
 Western
 Hemisphere,


acting
 to
 secure
 our
 national
 interest.


It's
 interesting,
 at least
 it
 was
 to
 me,


that
 the
 president
 chose
 to
 juxtapose


his
 implicit
 threats
 against
 Iran
 with


his
 already
 very
 explicit
 actions


against
 Venezuela.


>> That's
 right.


>> And
 America's
 armed
 forces
 overwhelmed


all
 defenses
 and
 utterly
 defeated
 a


enemy.
 He
 talked
 about
 that
 operation


>> and
 this
 was
 an
 absolutely
 colossal


victory
 for
 the
 security
 of
 the
 United


States
 and
 it
 also
 opens
 up
 a
 bright
 new


beginning
 for
 the
 people
 of
 Venezuela.


He
 then
 brings
 into
 the
 hall


>> chief
 warrant
 officer
 5
 Eric
 Slover


>> the
 helicopter
 pilot
 who
 was
 part
 of
 the


Maduro
 raid


>> while
 preparing
 to
 land
 enemy
 machine


guns
 fired
 from
 every
 angle
 and
 Eric
 was


hit
 very
 badly
 in
 the
 leg
 and
 hip
 one


bullet
 after
 another
 he
 absorbed


>> and
 who
 took
 incredible
 amounts
 of
 fire


his
 leg
 was
 shattered


>> then
 even
 as
 he
 was
 gushing
 blood
 which


was
 flowing
 back
 down
 the
 aisle.


Helicopter
 lands
 at
 a
 steep
 angle.


>> He
 lands
 the
 helicopter
 despite
 the
 fact


that
 he's
 bleeding.
 And
 the
 president


describes
 this
 in
 somewhat
 gory
 detail.


>> So,
 we
 have
 a
 surprise


for
 Eric
 and
 Amy
 in
 recognition
 of


Eric's
 actions
 above
 and
 beyond
 the
 call


of
 duty.
 And
 then
 of
 course
 they
 give


the
 pilot
 the
 Medal
 of
 Honor
 right
 there


in
 front
 of
 all
 of
 Congress
 and


everybody
 who's
 watching


>> with
 our
 nation's
 highest
 military


award,
 the
 Congressional
 Medal
 of
 Honor.


So
 that
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 brilliant


turn
 because
 how
 could
 the
 Democrats
 not


stand
 for
 the
 awarding
 of
 a
 medal
 to


somebody
 that
 courageous?
 And
 how
 could


they
 not
 stand
 when
 he
 did
 similar


awards
 for
 elderly
 veterans,
 some
 100


years
 old?


Navy
 fighter
 pilot
 Royce
 Williams
 served


in
 World
 War
 II,
 Korea,
 Vietnam,
 flying


more
 than
 220
 missions


>> who
 had
 fought
 in
 World
 War
 II
 and
 Korea


and
 Vietnam.


>> But
 tonight
 at
 100
 years
 old,
 this
 brave


Navy
 captain
 is
 finally
 getting
 the


recognition
 he
 deserves.
 He
 was
 alleged.


>> So
 at
 that
 moment,
 he
 sort
 of
 matched


his
 marshall
 tendencies.


with
 a
 celebration
 of
 great
 heroism.


>> I'm
 curious,
 David,
 as
 a
 veteran
 of


State
 of
 the
 Unions
 and
 also
 as
 someone


who's
 covered
 military
 affairs
 in
 your


day,
 how
 you
 thought
 about
 all
 of
 the


military
 awards
 that
 the
 president


bestowed
 during
 this
 speech.
 I
 tend
 to


think
 of
 those
 as
 awards
 typically
 given


in
 solemn,
 much
 more
 intimate


ceremonies.


This
 is
 the
 most
 public
 possible
 venue.


A
 president's
 state
 of
 the
 union
 and


thus
 has
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 partisan
 tinge.
 A


purple
 heart
 was
 given
 out.


Congressional
 medals
 of
 honor
 were
 given


out.
 Was
 that
 celebrating
 American


heroism
 or
 was
 that
 in
 some
 ways


exploiting
 it?
 I
 think
 there
 was
 an


element
 of
 showmanship
 and
 an
 element
 of


exploitation
 to
 it
 as
 well
 because
 what


he
 was
 doing
 was
 combining
 the


experiences
 of
 these
 people
 in
 just


wars,
 World
 War
 II,
 you
 know,
 and
 so


forth,


>> Korea,
 where
 we
 were
 fighting
 for
 a
 nent


democracy,


and
 managing
 to
 try
 to
 merge
 that
 with


what
 many
 would
 argue
 were
 less
 clear


uses
 of
 American
 power
 potentially
 even


illegal


>> and
 potentially
 illegal
 and
 we're
 headed


to
 that
 debate
 about
 Iran
 for
 sure
 if
 he


went
 ahead.
 So
 this
 is
 sort
 of
 taking


the
 Ronald
 Reagan
 idea
 of
 putting


prominent
 guests
 and
 heroes
 in
 the
 state


of
 the
 union
 audience
 and
 moving
 it
 to


the
 next
 level
 by
 awarding
 them
 these


medals
 in
 front
 of
 the
 entire
 congress.


>> So
 David,
 take
 us
 to
 the
 end
 of
 this


speech.
 The
 third
 act
 when
 President


Trump
 takes
 a
 stab
 at
 unity.


>> Well,
 Michael,
 the
 third
 act,


>> 250
 years
 is
 a
 long
 time
 in
 the
 life
 of


a
 nation.
 But
 in
 another
 sense,
 it's


really
 a
 mere
 moment
 in
 the
 eye
 of


history.


>> Picked
 up
 on
 the
 250th
 anniversary
 of


America.


>> Everything
 our
 nation
 has
 done,


everything
 we
 have
 achieved
 has
 been
 the


work
 of
 those
 few
 great
 lifetimes.
 So
 he


talked
 about
 America
 as
 a
 young
 nation.


>> Americans
 lifted
 humanity
 into
 the
 skies


on
 the
 wings
 of
 aluminum
 and
 steel.


>> Then
 he
 talked
 about
 America
 as
 an


innovative
 nation.


>> All
 of
 this
 and
 so
 much
 more
 is
 the


enduring
 legacy,
 unmatched
 glory
 of
 the


hardworking
 patriots
 who
 built
 and


defended
 this
 country
 and
 who
 still


carry
 the
 hopes
 and
 freedoms


on
 all
 of
 humanity's
 backs.
 Then
 he


talked
 about
 Americans
 as
 people
 who


could
 never
 be
 defeated,
 whose
 ideas
 and


spirit
 sort
 of
 carried
 through
 and
 could


do
 anything
 in
 the
 world.


>> There
 is
 no
 challenge
 Americans
 cannot


overcome,
 no
 frontier
 too
 vast
 for
 us
 to


conquer,
 no
 dream
 too
 bold
 for
 us
 to


chase,
 no
 horizon
 too
 distant
 for
 us
 to


claim.
 For
 our
 destiny
 is
 written
 by
 the


hand
 of
 providence
 and
 these
 first
 250


years
 were
 just
 the
 beginning.


>> Who
 did
 that
 sound
 like?


>> Joe
 Biden
 who
 used
 to
 say
 at
 every


speech,


>> there's
 nothing
 Americans
 can't


accomplish.
 And
 in
 some
 ways
 it
 was
 not


like
 Donald
 Trump,


>> but
 he
 delivered
 it
 with
 some
 passion.


And
 it
 made
 you
 realize
 that
 he
 has


within
 him


>> the
 ability
 to
 talk
 in
 unifying
 terms.


He
 just
 can't
 help
 himself.


>> And
 our
 future
 will
 be
 bigger,
 better,


brighter,
 bolder,
 and
 more
 glorious
 than


ever
 before.
 Thank
 you.
 God
 bless
 you


and
 God
 bless
 America.


So
 in
 the
 end,
 thinking
 back
 to
 the


stakes
 of
 this
 all,
 at
 this
 moment
 in


the
 economy,
 at
 this
 moment
 in
 the


immigration
 battles
 in
 the
 country
 and


potentially
 at
 the
 start
 of
 a
 new
 war,


did
 he
 meet
 the
 moment?


>> You
 know,
 I
 don't
 think,
 Michael,
 that


he
 moved
 the
 needle.
 He
 had
 to
 go


convince
 Americans
 in
 this
 speech
 that


the
 evidence
 indicated
 that
 they
 didn't


need
 to
 feel
 this
 economically
 insecure.


I
 don't
 think
 he
 met
 that.
 He
 had
 to
 go


lay
 out
 a
 rationale
 for
 why
 we
 may
 be
 at


war
 in
 the
 next
 couple
 of
 days.
 He


certainly
 didn't
 do
 that.
 He
 had
 to
 go


make
 the
 case
 that
 the
 Republican
 party


had
 a
 full
 policy
 agenda
 that
 was
 ready


to
 go
 between
 now
 and
 the
 midterm


elections.
 And
 there
 was
 very
 little


policy
 in
 this
 speech.
 So
 my
 overall


sense
 is
 President
 Trump
 talked
 about


how
 he
 believes
 the
 country
 should
 view


him


rather
 than
 how
 it
 does
 view
 him.


>> And
 that
 raised
 the
 question
 of
 whether


or
 not
 he
 is
 yet
 in
 tune
 with
 the
 rest


of
 the
 nation.


Well,
 David,
 it
 is
 now
 almost
 1:00
 a.m.


It's
 time
 for
 you
 to
 go
 to
 bed.


>> It
 certainly
 is.


>> Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 Appreciate
 it.


>> Thanks
 much,
 Michael.


Shortly
 after
 President
 Trump's
 speech,


the
 newly
 elected
 governor
 of
 Virginia,


Abigail
 Spanberger,
 delivered
 the


Democratic
 party's
 rebuttal.


>> You
 have
 to
 ask,
 who
 benefits
 from
 his


rhetoric,
 his
 policies,
 his
 actions,
 the


short
 list
 of
 laws
 he's
 pushed
 through


this
 Republican
 Congress.


>> Span
 Burker
 portrayed
 the
 president
 as
 a


selfdeing
 egoomaniac.


Somebody
 must
 be
 benefiting.


He's
 enriching
 himself,
 his
 family,
 his


friends.
 The
 scale
 of
 the
 corruption
 is


unprecedented.


Cozying
 up
 to
 foreign
 princes
 for


airplanes
 and
 billionaires
 for


ballrooms,
 putting
 his
 name
 and
 face
 on


buildings
 all
 over
 our
 nation's
 capital.


This
 is
 not
 what
 our
 founders


envisioned.
 Not
 by
 a
 long
 shot.
 and
 said


that
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 both
 the


president
 and
 his
 agenda
 are
 deeply
 out


of
 touch
 with
 regular
 Americans.
 Is
 the


president
 working
 for
 you?
 We
 all
 know


the
 answer
 is
 no.


>> We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's


what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.
 On


Tuesday,
 House
 Republicans
 voted
 down
 a


bill
 that
 federal
 regulators
 said
 could


prevent
 deadly
 midair
 collisions
 like


the
 one
 last
 year
 in
 Washington
 DC
 that


killed
 67
 people.
 The
 bill,
 which
 would


have
 required
 planes
 to
 carry
 advanced


location
 tracking
 technology,
 was


originally
 endorsed
 by
 the
 Defense


Department
 and
 adopted
 by
 the
 Senate
 in


December.
 But
 the
 Defense
 Department
 has


since
 withdrawn
 its
 support,
 citing


concerns
 over
 national
 security
 and


costs.
 That
 prompted
 just
 enough
 House


Republicans
 to
 vote
 against
 the
 bill
 to


block
 its
 passage.


And


>> um
 coming
 on
 to
 say
 it
 is
 day
 24
 since


our
 mom


was
 taken
 in
 the
 dark
 of
 night
 from
 her


bed


and
 every
 hour
 and
 minute
 and
 second
 and


every
 long
 night
 has
 been
 agony.
 In
 her


latest
 plea
 with
 the
 public,
 Savannah


Guthrie,
 the
 Today
 Show
 co-host,
 said


that
 her
 family
 was
 offering
 up
 to
 $1


million
 for
 information
 that
 leads


police
 to
 find
 her
 mother,
 Nancy.


>> Someone
 out
 there
 knows
 something
 that


can
 bring
 her
 home.
 Somebody
 knows.
 And


we
 are
 begging
 you
 to
 please
 come


forward
 now.
 Despite
 a
 massive
 more
 than


3-w
 weekekl
 long
 investigation,
 police


appear
 to
 have
 few
 leads
 about
 who


abducted
 Nancy
 Guthrie
 on
 February
 1st


in
 Arizona
 or
 where
 she
 is.
 In
 the


video,
 Savannah
 Guthrie
 acknowledged


that
 her
 mother
 may
 already
 be
 dead.


>> We
 also
 know
 that


she
 may
 be
 lost.
 She
 may
 already
 be


gone.


But
 we
 need
 to
 know
 where
 she
 is.
 We


need
 her
 to
 come
 home.
