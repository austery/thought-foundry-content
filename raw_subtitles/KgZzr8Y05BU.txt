Okay.
It's official 2025 was the year.
Creativity seemingly died.
The bestselling movies
like Zootopia to Jurassic World and
Mission Impossible eight were all sequels,
or they were remasters like Lilo
and Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon.
Similarly, the best selling video games
battlefield six, Borderlands
four, Madden 26 were all big franchises
or remasters like Oblivion Remastered.
Meanwhile, names
that we've seen for decades like Lady
Gaga, Billie Eilish and Bruno Mars
once again dominated the music charts.
And now 2025 was not an exceptional year
in that regard.
Take a look at this chart.
30 years ago,
only about one quarter of the top 20
movies were sequels,
spinoffs, prequels, or remakes.
Now it's close to 90%.
Similarly,
almost all of the top selling video games
now come from established franchises.
Even books show this very same trend.
The share of top selling titles
written by an already famous
author is increasing each year.
But wasn't
the internet supposed to do the opposite?
In the early 2000s, wired
editor in chief Chris Anderson
famously predicted that as the internet
made it cheaper and cheaper
to send songs, movies and games
to customers around the world,
this would enable niche creators to rise,
while it would cause big studios
to become less powerful.
This theory, the theory of the long
tail, was a beautiful idea
the democratization of culture.
So what went wrong?
As always on Monday macro
for this video, we, a team of economists,
went deep into the economic literature
and summarized all the key insights
that can explain why big budget sequels
are bigger than ever today.
And we ask a question
if the rise of sequels reduced creativity
or if there's actually
a thriving long tail of amazing
niche content that you just don't know
about hiding below the surface.
But to answer these questions,
we first need to understand how the media
industry used to work the gatekeeper
economics of the pre-Internet media.
Let's go back to the 1980s.
Now imagine you were a singer and wanted
to earn a living with your passion.
The odds would be stacked against you
from the very beginning.
First, you needed a studio
filled with super expensive equipment
to record your song.
Second, to distribute your song,
you needed a factory to press records.
Third, these records then needed to be
distributed to thousands of record shops.
These record shops had limited
shelf space, so to convince shops to sell
your record, you needed to have
an existing relationship
or prove you were already popular
by getting airtime on the radio,
for which again,
you also needed the right connections.
Be short before asking consumers
if they like their content.
Aspiring creators
first had to convince gatekeepers
like record labels to give them a shot.
If granted funding, they could record
and distribute their music.
This system did produce many, many songs,
movies, and games that actually sold
really well and were loved
by both consumers and critics.
However, as you can imagine,
this extra layer
killed a lot of films, games, and music
that we would have loved.
In fact,
some of our most beloved cultural icons
almost got stuck with the gatekeepers.
For example, J.K.
Rowling's Harry Potter book
was first rejected by 12 publishers before
it was published by Bloomsbury,
and even the Beatles were rejected
by nearly every major label
in Europe before producer
George Martin finally signed them in 1962.
So, of course,
when one the cost of recording equipment
fell lower and lower, and two the internet
made distribution costs almost zero.
Anderson's long term prediction
about the rise of niche media
and the fall of big, safe
blockbusters made total sense.
Yet here we are today
with more blockbusters than ever.
So again, what happened
to the fall of the gatekeepers?
The digital revolution would revolutionize
the media industry into main ways.
First, the internet made distribution
almost free.
Overnight music and movies
no longer had to be pressed onto CDs
or DVDs, or sold in physical stores
with a few clicks,
songs and films could be downloaded
straight into an iPod or a laptop.
But at first, gatekeepers
trying to hold back change.
However, after piracy, platforms
like Napster, The Pirate Bay and others
devastated the revenue in all creative
and especially the music industry.
Record labels, publishers and others
increasingly brought their content
to legal online distribution platforms
like Spotify, Netflix and Steam.
Second, digital technologies dramatically
reduced the cost of creating art.
Suddenly, you could shoot a movie
on your iPhone or record music
in a home studio using inexpensive
microphones and software.
This allowed many artists
to self-fund their work and distribute it
online to millions of people, effectively
bypassing traditional gatekeepers.
So yes, in the early days of the internet,
the long tail looked to be coming true.
As you can see here in these graphs
by economic professor Joel Wold Fogel,
the number of new songs added each year
rose from about 50,000 in 1988
to nearly 350,000 by 2007.
Meanwhile, the number of US made
original films also exploded,
along with self-published book titles
and television shows.
So the first part of Anderson's prediction
actually seems to have been through
far lower production costs
and cheap distribution
have led to an explosion in creativity.
The long tail is there,
but while the number of songs, movies
and shows exploded,
people increasingly spend their money
on consuming sequels and franchises.
Rather than these products.
But why?
It is.
Research professor Walt Fogel
first looked at two obvious explanations.
The first is that while it could be true
that many more creative products are made,
the quality of these
could actually be very low.
To test this hypothesis, Walt
Fogel looked at reviews are independent.
Production is bad,
therefore scoring lower review scores
than big budget sequels or remakes.
For music,
this does not appear to be the case.
Combining lists of best albums
into a critic based quality index.
He finds that while critics really,
really loved music
from the 1970s, average appreciation
for newer music
remained stable after Napster
revolutionized song distribution.
Meanwhile, TV shows
seemingly only got better.
This graph shows IMDb ratings for the top
25 release TV shows, and as more TV
shows were made, the average quality
did not seem to suffer at all.
Finally, for video games,
we can also see that as the years pass,
independently developed games
actually increasingly dominate
top game lists by critics and audiences
alike.
Even during the 2025 game awards,
it was not bestsellers like battlefield
six, Borderlands four, or Madden 26
that dominated the awards,
but rather smaller, self-published games
like Silksong
Hades
two and Claire Obscure expedition 33.
So big budget
franchises and remakes don't sell more
because they are objectively better
than independent productions.
This brings us to about Vogel's
second hypothesis
that independent productions
are simply not finding their audience.
Perhaps they lack the marketing budget,
or perhaps
buyers are just increasingly
nostalgic and risk averse.
No, surprisingly, that does not appear
to be the case.
Independent productions
are actually selling more and more
in the music industry.
Independent labels were increasingly
penetrating the Billboard's
Top 200 during the early internet years.
Also, self-published books
such as, most famously, 50 Shades of Gray
are in fact increasingly amongst
the world's best selling books.
Similarly, in film, independent movies
accounted for about one quarter of box
office revenues in the 1990s,
but by 2012 their share had risen to 40%.
Independent films also represented
more than half of DVD sales.
Then finally on gaming platforms
that are easiest to publish for,
like steam on the PC,
independently developed games did account
almost for half the revenue
in 2020
for similar to big budget productions.
This is why in his book
what Fogel does actually argue
that the long term prediction was correct.
The digital revolution did in fact produce
a golden age in media.
But the puzzle is still here, isn't it?
If creativity has actually flourished,
then why do sequels,
prequels, and franchises
seem more dominant than ever?
Why do blockbuster movies and Triple-A
video
games look increasingly repetitive?
To understand how both of these trends
can be true at the same time,
we need to understand
a different mechanism that has transformed
the media, which is globalization
and the economics of the superstar.
Culture markets are what economists call
superstar markets.
That is,
every consumer has access to the best
game,
the best musician, and the best movie.
Economists have observed
that in these types of markets,
the very best artists
tend to become superstars.
To illustrate this
principle, economist doctor
Felix Koenig studied how the staggered
rollout of television across the US
transformed the fortunes of entertainers
that used to play in bars or local venues
like dancers, musicians and comedians.
In the 1940s, the distribution of earnings
for these entertainers looked like this.
Some artists were poorer.
Some were rich.
Most earn a decent, normal wage.
After television became widespread,
though in the 1970s, entertainers
who once reached only small audiences
in clubs could now reach the entire
country, performing directly into people's
living rooms.
This transformed
how audiences chose what to watch,
with only a few channels to scan.
Viewers, of course, switched from
a very funny comedian to the funniest one.
As a result, the funniest comedians
captured a disproportionate
share of attention and became superstars,
while merely funny comedians lost
most of their audience to the superstars.
Not surprisingly, by the 1970s,
fewer comedians earned ordinary wages,
while a small fraction
became extraordinarily rich.
This is the power of superstar markets.
And this brings us back to the graphs
from the introduction.
Movies, video games and books.
Inside the top 20.
They all became more concentrated.
This trend happened
as digitalization happened
and the internet became more popular.
But it also happened
when another trend took place.
The globalization of mass media,
especially as the English language spread
across the globe and Asia, got a lot
richer, creating many more consumers.
Indeed, as you can see here,
for most of the 20th century,
Hollywood earned the majority of its box
office revenue
domestically, with international markets
playing a secondary role.
That pattern has now reversed.
Today, most of the theatrical revenue
from major films
comes from outside the US and Canada.
Driven by the expansion of markets
such as China and the growth of English
speaking audiences across
Asia, Latin America and Europe,
this is where superstar economics
fully comes into play.
Films
that travel best across global markets
tend to share certain characteristics.
Visual spectacle.
Familiar franchises.
And instantly recognizable stars.
When you put on some muscle
and you know in this superstar
environment, small differences
in quality or recognition
can have outside effects.
Securing a top tier actor, a celebrated
director, a cutting edge CGI crew.
This can significantly boost
a global box office performance.
However, this brings us
to the final piece of the puzzle.
This is all very expensive.
So as making top tier content became
more expensive due to superstar economics,
it also makes sense
that investors increasingly demanded safe
products.
This can explain why, in the top
of the global market, we increasingly saw
the production of spectacle,
high budget sequels, spinoffs and remakes.
So globalization can explain why
we see more and more concentration
at the very top.
If you want to play the blockbuster game,
you need to invest more and more.
And the safest way to do
that is to focus on sequels and remakes.
But meanwhile, digitization
and falling production costs
can explain why we do actually also see
an explosion of creativity, creativity
that is actually both reaching audiences
and leading to critical acclaim.
Indeed, as you can see here, for movies,
we have seen more and more money available
for cheap movies and for blockbusters,
but not for a high value productions
that cannot quite be blockbusters.
Therefore, I'm happy to say
that for this video
we have a quite optimistic conclusion.
No, 2025 is not a bad year for pop
culture in general, just for the top 20.
If, like me, you are fed up with sequels
and remakes, then actually
there is a massive long tail out there
for every media category.
For example,
I really enjoy video games and honestly,
I'm having more fun than ever.
While I used to play blockbusters
like Call of Duty one and Call of Duty two
when I was younger last year, I really had
just as much fun playing independent
games on my Steam Deck, like hotline
Miami, Bilateral Potato, and Undertale.
On the other hand, for movies,
I would not know where to look.
Luckily, through making this video,
I found out that my colleague
Alejandro is a real independent movie fan
and he did not watch blockbusters
or remakes at all last year.
Just amazing titles
like the Norwegian Sentimental Value,
the Spanish Sirat and the Iranian film.
It was just an accident.
So the real question, in my opinion,
is actually how do you find the long tail?
Well, one of the simplest ways to do
this is luckily right here on YouTube.
Just use the search bar
and type top ten Best independent Games,
best independent Movies, books
or songs of 2025 or of all time.
And there you'll find
that creativity has not disappeared.
It has split in two with a vast, vibrant,
long tail of experimentation
coexisting alongside a small number
of highly optimized blockbusters
that dominate
our shared cultural spotlight.
But yeah, that's my take.
