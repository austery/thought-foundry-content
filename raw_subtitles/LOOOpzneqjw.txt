Hi everyone, I'm Anthony.
Welcome to my channel
Today's video
Let's continue exploring the mother-daughter relationship in Chinese families.
After the last video was released
Many netizens commented in the comment section.
He left behind very sincere and valuable remarks.
Their personal experiences
This also confirms
That kind of tangled and complicated pain towards one's mother
Origin
A structural dilemma with deep psychological roots
As we mentioned in the last episode
The special thing about the mother-daughter relationship is
It is more likely to cause physical entanglement.
Due to the convenience of same sex
The mother often unconsciously...
Treat it as an extension of your own body
From the micro-management of clothing and food
From commenting on body shape and appearance
We said
Body stability
It is spiritual
The premise and foundation for maintaining self-identity
Therefore, when a mother is concerned about her daughter's body
To make meticulous judgments
When correcting and taking over
She is actually disrupting this constant.
This excessive physical intrusion
It destroyed the physiological foundation for the daughter to establish her own identity.
This leads to many daughters, even after they reach adulthood, still having children.
I still feel like there's an invisible umbilical cord.
Connected to the mother
Then we point out
The father is the "elephant in the room."
It is precisely because of the father's emotional and functional absence
The mother took the emotional needs that originally belonged to the husband and wife.
Everything was transferred to the daughter.
This made my daughter
Forced to take on an extremely heavy role
Mother's spiritual husband
She is both her mother's trash can and a dumping ground for her mother.
Another lifeline for the mother
This misaligned relationship
This plunged the parties involved into a state of extreme turmoil.
He deeply loved his mother's suffering.
He also resented his mother's weakness and control.
This leads us to today's video.
The core issues to be explored
When a daughter is in this
At the center of a vortex of love and hate
How is she supposed to survive?
To survive
In order to deal with this tearing pain
We say women
Usually develop
Two completely different survival strategies
One is submission and salvation.
Trying to appease her mother by sacrificing herself
Another is anger and rebellion.
Attempting to sever ties through escape and resistance
So these two strategies
Is it possible to successfully lead someone out of the cycle of reincarnation?
That's our topic today.
I will upload this video.
Included in the list of "Psychology and Education"
If you have anything you'd like to discuss with me
And the topics of consultation
You can contact me via email to make an appointment.
First, let's discuss the first survival strategy.
That is, through obedience, appeasement, and sacrifice.
To rescue and comfort the mother
This type of daughter
We actually see this very often in our lives.
They are usually what people call "good girls".
She is her mother's little cotton-padded jacket
But deep in their hearts
Hidden within is the soul of a savior
She may have a good education and abilities.
I've also said some things about longing for distant places.
But in the end, she chose to stay in her hometown.
Stay with mother
And generally speaking
They also lack ambition and confidence in the workplace.
Weak will
I have no interest in self-improvement.
Sometimes they even seem to lack their own opinions.
No self
I once chatted with a mother
She proudly said that her daughter was very well-behaved.
Returning to my hometown after graduation
Then
I arranged a government job for my daughter.
The mother said that girls just need a stable life.
But this kind of obedience, stability, and incompetence
This is usually a way for daughters to save their mothers.
Because in a symbiotic mother-daughter relationship
Success often means betrayal
If you become very powerful
Very rich
Very opinionated
This means you can at any time
They gained the ability to fly.
It means you and that weak
The gap between trivial, painful mothers
getting bigger and bigger
For a daughter who longs to save her mother
This gap in ability
It will bring immense guilt.
She subconsciously feels
If I'm doing too well
That would leave Mom alone in hell.
Therefore, in order not to betray his mother
In order to maintain the connection with her mother
She subconsciously forbade herself from succeeding.
She must make herself
Maintain a certain degree of incompetence and dependence.
Only in this way can I stay by my mother's side with a clear conscience.
Continue to be that companion
not to mention
In her mother-daughter relationship
I've exhausted my emotional energy.
To deal with the mother's pain
There was simply no extra energy.
To cope with workplace challenges and competition
For her
Drifting through life is what she does outside of intense emotional labor.
The only way to rest
Some men may think
Such well-behaved girls are very obedient.
Lack of one's own will
Therefore, it is very suitable for marriage.
However, this is a huge misunderstanding.
Because no adult does it voluntarily.
Completely subservient to others
That kind of obedience and compliance is just a false self.
Many women may seem easy to talk to before marriage.
Lack of opinion
But after marriage
Especially after having children or entering middle age
They may experience a period of awakening self-awareness.
And the belated rebellious period
And because it had been suppressed for a long time
Therefore, the energy of this rebellious phase is actually stronger.
More importantly
Those who think marrying a "good girl"
A man who can be the head of a household
Often found
He is not the true mastermind of this family.
Not a wife
Instead, it was the wife's parents.
Because his wife was used to being obedient.
So, on the surface, the wife may seem to listen to her husband.
But the wife's parents always...
She showed an extremely strong desire to control their marriage.
so
He was essentially dating his wife's entire family.
And if this symbiotic relationship is more serious...
This will lead to hibernation
Or severe social anxiety
My daughter doesn't go out socializing.
They don't go out to look for work.
She might say she's sick.
Or using social anxiety as a reason
Lock yourself at home
His mother probably nags him every day.
You need to go to work quickly.
Hurry up and find a partner
Don't always stay at home
But this is only the surface-level, explicit language.
The mother's hidden emotions
For example, sighing to show weakness.
Even getting sick
But they were all looking towards their daughter.
Transmitting a completely opposite signal
It's dangerous outside.
Only home is safe
I only have you
I'm finished once you leave.
Sensitive daughter
This hidden signal was accurately captured.
then
A secret conspiracy was reached between the mother and daughter.
The mother scolded and nagged at the same time
On the one hand, he took care of his daughter's daily life.
They even brought the food to the bedside.
This is tantamount to pushing the child away.
Holding the child tightly in her arms
For the reclusive daughter
Lock yourself in the house
Not only can it avoid the challenges and risks of the outside world
at the same time
It was also to respond to the mother's deepest expectations.
but
Human vitality cannot be completely suppressed.
When the spirit cannot directly express itself
The body will express itself in place of the spirit.
so
We see many women like this
Often through severe physical symptoms
to express protest
For example, eating disorders
Whatever you eat, you vomit.
It was in a relationship where she was completely consumed.
The only thing that can be completely controlled
Anorexia
It is often due to the mother's forced feeding and control.
The most extreme form of rejection
Because of the human mouth
It is the first line of defense for a person's self.
Decide what to eat
and what not to eat
It is the earliest way for humankind to establish its own boundaries.
She was unable to reject her mother on a conscious level.
Because refusing would cause a strong sense of guilt.
So she pretended to be sick.
That is, feeling physiological nausea and vomiting.
This gave him a legitimate shield.
This allows me to say no to my mother.
For example
Some children like to stay in the bathroom for a long time.
There were even some minor physical difficulties.
For example, constipation, leg numbness, etc.
This is because within the family
She lacks a private space.
Even the bedroom is not safe.
She at any time
They all had to answer their parents' questions and summons.
Only the bathroom is a legally lockable space.
And places that parents cannot enter in a short period of time
Therefore, those minor physical symptoms
It is the cost they pay for a mental respite.
In this enclosed space of a few square meters
She had a period of time where she didn't need to respond to the outside world.
Instead, it is time that belongs entirely to oneself.
Some girls may also experience irregular menstruation and gastrointestinal problems.
Or a sudden drop in weight
Although this often stems from physiological reasons
But in some people with a strong desire for control
In a family full of emotional entanglements
These symptoms may carry additional psychological significance.
This refers to the subconscious "de-sexualization".
By returning the body to an undeveloped childlike state
In the individual subconscious
Refusing to become an adult woman
Because becoming an adult woman is too dangerous.
That means being like a mother.
An unhappy marriage
Or it could mean eventually leaving her mother.
so
Although the person involved did not do it intentionally.
But she inadvertently maintained these symptoms.
To sacrifice one's social function
Even physical health can be a way to maintain this relationship.
After discussing the rescue-type daughter...
Let's talk about the second type.
That is, the seemingly rebellious daughter
Unlike the rescue type
rebellious daughter
She clearly recognized her mother's weakness.
and the father's irresponsibility
They may have repeatedly sworn in their hearts.
I never want to live like my mother.
She considers herself clear-headed, independent, and modern.
However
She may have done it in another secret way.
This bizarre cycle has been achieved.
for example
There is such a real case
A woman with a mother who endured humiliation and hardship
and an irresponsible father
Father owes a lot of debt
But he still neglects his family.
The mother, on the other hand, was paying off the father's debts.
On the one hand, maintaining this broken marriage
This woman in her youth
He questioned his mother about why she hadn't gotten a divorce yet.
Why stay in such a painful marriage?
Later she met a man
This man is highly educated.
He is a senior executive of a well-known company.
Although it's unknown what the woman was thinking at the time.
But one can imagine that
She probably thinks
I found a very successful
and excellent men
It was with her unreliable father.
Completely different
However, strangely enough...
Her husband, however, experienced setbacks at work.
Falling into a prolonged slump
For more than a decade
None of them were able to truly return to work in society.
He remained immersed in the fantasy of being an unappreciated talent.
He often excitedly tells those around him...
He talked about his grand principles
In this process
His intelligence gradually faded.
It revealed the deep-seated tendency in his personality to shirk responsibility.
The fragile nature of a grown-up baby
So how did this woman do it?
She did not leave her husband.
There wasn't even any advice or warning to her husband.
Instead, like one's own mother
She shouldered the heavy burden of the family.
Not only in
Financial support for her husband
She also continuously nurtured her husband's narcissism spiritually.
This is undeniably a strange cycle.
Although
Her husband looks very different from her father.
Her husband isn't that in debt.
But the structure of marriage has not changed.
She remains an overly responsible and strong woman.
In providing care for a functionally deficient
A man who shirks responsibility
She ultimately lived on.
The way her mother used to look down
So why did it end up like this?
We often see
Many people in their youth
I deeply hate my parents for the domestic violence they inflicted on me.
However, they entered a new intimate relationship
Or after having children
They haven't truly broken free from the cycle of violence.
Because hatred is not true separation.
It is another form of entanglement.
certainly
Hatred and anger are necessary in the initial stages.
It can help victims stay conscious.
Draw a line
To prevent being pulled back by that gravitational force
But hatred is only the first step in separation.
if
You remain trapped in extreme hatred towards your mother.
Your coordinate system
It is still based on the mother.
Everything you do is to be unlike her.
It's like a reflection.
Although the directions are opposite
But the movements are completely synchronized.
True transcendence is about being "unrelated".
Instead of doing the opposite
This phenomenon is not limited to parent-child relationships.
Rather, it is reflected in many aspects.
That is the rebels
Or rather, the solidification of the victim's identity.
As you year after year
Staying in anger towards one's family of origin
Rebellious behavior is actually deeply tied to your ego.
Your way of thinking, self-concept, and emotional patterns
Both are based on the perpetrator and the victim.
On the ruins of war, of control and resistance
What you are intimately familiar with is the struggle for power.
It is a confrontation between the strong and the weak.
It is about recognizing hostility and defending against counterattacks.
True equality and gentleness
A relationship of mutual encouragement and appreciation
It's unfamiliar to you.
Even things that make you feel bored and uneasy
In order to survive in a hostile environment
Or perhaps to defeat that powerful sadist
The victim must constantly try to understand the abuser's thoughts.
Over time
The sadist's logic and values
Even the sadistic way abusers view the world
The victim is perfectly internalized
Since your ego
It was maintained through resistance and fighting.
So if there are no enemies
Instead, I feel a strange emptiness.
Therefore, the person involved will be in an intimate relationship
Examining your partner with a magnifying glass
subconscious
Expecting or even inducing the other party
Become the perpetrator or the incompetent
So that I can put on my armor again
Playing the most familiar role of the rebel
In this case
Although the person involved found a
It seemed worldly at the time
A man with great achievements
However, deep down
She may have keenly sensed it.
Beneath the other party's glamorous exterior
There is an extremely fragile and malignant narcissism
And a personality that wants to run away when faced with difficulties.
And this is exactly what she is very familiar with.
Although rationally
She wants to find a good person.
But subconsciously, the definition of love...
It was written in the context of one's family of origin.
That is love
Always associated with patience and sacrifice
Associated with sadomasochism
If a man is healthy
Mature and responsible
Then he wouldn't need to be saved.
It does not need to be modified.
Her logic is
"My mother was helpless when faced with that mess back then."
If I could take over a similar mess
And make it better.
Then I will have truly surpassed my mother.
In her childhood script
Mother lost to Father
Unable to change father
Mother is a loser
And if she found one
Men with similar defects to their fathers
She can achieve this through her own efforts.
Win the war that Mother Lost
This is not just for the sake of his marriage.
It is also to prove that "love can overcome trauma".
This is the only way to heal that childhood trauma.
Frustration at being powerless against men
Some people might ask
Why is the person involved able to criticize their mother while simultaneously criticizing her?
On the one hand, she's doing things similar to her mother.
This is not hard to understand.
Humans are very good at dualistic thinking.
She would perceive her mother as weak and blind.
Pitiful and helpless
She, on the other hand, actively chose this path of a "leading lady" in life.
It's about being tolerant of others from a superior position.
She even felt a sense of greatness and sublimity from it.
Although to outsiders the difference is not significant
certainly
No one is perfect.
Everyone has some degree of trauma.
I am by no means encouraging a fastidious view of love.
That is to say, seeing that the other person has trauma
You should leave the other party immediately.
If that's the case
There is no love in this world.
And we must admit
In love
Trauma is fascinating in many ways.
It has a strong appeal.
so
Being drawn to trauma is not necessarily bad.
We can certainly choose
After seeing the other person's true and dark side
Still love each other
To be tolerant and heal the other person
Of course, you can also choose not to love and leave.
The key question is whether they can actually see each other.
And whether it's healing or conspiracy
If the wife's function is normal
She should set a bottom line.
For example, requiring the husband to go to work.
Or even if you don't work
But they also need to shoulder their responsibilities as adults.
Instead
Allowing her husband to continue his decadence and escapism for years on end
However, she ultimately chose to be with her husband.
Their incompetence led to a conspiracy.
She described her husband's symptoms
As an object that needs protection
Rather than the problem that needs to be solved
This is not what it means to see trauma.
But it only reinforced the trauma.
She did not take any truly constructive action.
Many painful marriages stem from...
The wife outwardly criticizes the childish man.
But to some extent
And I don't want the other person to really grow.
To truly become an independent person who takes responsibility for oneself.
People who are able to socialize successfully
for example
Some women's fathers are destructive giant babies.
He was brutal, cold, unfaithful, and aggressive.
So, to avoid this situation
They found a weak and incompetent person.
Dependent people
Such a person is weak
But it is controllable
However, this is just another form of overgrown child.
This controllable weakness is like a black hole.
It drained his life force year after year.
turn out
She is like her mother
They both exhausted themselves in this relationship.
Nurturing a man who never grew up
