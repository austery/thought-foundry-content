I think working with people you're close to is underrated. I feel like for all the ventures of any significance in my life, they've not only been with others, but been with other people that I'm very close to and where I had and would like to have an enduring relationship that outlives them. And sometimes when here's the advice that you shouldn't work with friends or you shouldn't work with your partner or something like that. And all these things are idiosyncratic and there are instances of every possible permutation. but... but for me it's been a really rewarding experience.
