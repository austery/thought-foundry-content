[Speaker 0]:  okay，
[Speaker 0]:  let's take a look at this iphone document。
[Speaker 0]:  first，
[Speaker 0]:  i don't know if you've been following this series of content loe，
[Speaker 0]:  you know，
[Speaker 0]:  in the republican party，
[Speaker 0]:  there's actually a fringe group called cuue。
[Speaker 0]:  these people are very active on some online forms，
[Speaker 0]:  such as FT and some other right wing forms。
[Speaker 0]:  conspiracy theories，
[Speaker 0]:  you no ten years ago，
[Speaker 0]:  they had a very popular conspiracy theory called pizza gate。
[Speaker 0]:  i don't know if you pay attention to it back then。
[Speaker 0]:  oh，
[Speaker 0]:  i really didn't what was the reason for pizza gay back then？
[Speaker 0]:  during hillary clinton and trumseelection campaign，
[Speaker 0]:  one of hiller's topis had their account act。
[Speaker 0]:  a large number of emails were lead to wiki leagues，
[Speaker 0]:  put on various public platforms，
[Speaker 0]:  and everyone could see them among them。
[Speaker 0]:  they found many veiled references，
[Speaker 0]:  like，
[Speaker 0]:  let's go eat pizza today or what kind of pizza，
[Speaker 0]:  these were clearly coded messages。
[Speaker 0]:  code name is something that's inconvenient to say in the email。
[Speaker 0]:  so they used pizza as a substitute。
[Speaker 0]:  so when this rumor came out，
[Speaker 0]:  it was actually rejected by the mainstream media。
[Speaker 0]:  everyone thought it was too outrageous。
[Speaker 0]:  pizza gate question mark，
[Speaker 0]:  in their theory at the time was that there was a global network of elites in the united states involved in sex trafficking and child's sexual abuse。
[Speaker 0]:  the main leader of this network was hillary clinton，
[Speaker 0]:  and the democratic party elites were all going to this place to enjoy this kind of pedophilia service。
[Speaker 0]:  then many republican supporters believed it。
[Speaker 0]:  one guy even took a gun and went to a pizza shop and started shooting，
[Speaker 0]:  although no one was killed。
[Speaker 0]:  it is said that he shot through a hard drive，
[Speaker 0]:  then they said that there might be a basement in a pizza shop where these traffic and abducted children were being held，
[Speaker 0]:  and they were trying to rescue them。
[Speaker 0]:  when this news came out，
[Speaker 0]:  many people thought wow，
[Speaker 0]:  this is too outrageous。
[Speaker 0]:  it sounds like a conspiracy theory right less than control one hundred greater than it's just this kind of utterly stupid conspiracy theory completely baseless。
[Speaker 0]:  anyone who believes this stuff is mentally ill。
[Speaker 0]:  but anyway，
[Speaker 0]:  after the new year，
[Speaker 0]:  these abstein documents were released。
[Speaker 0]:  i don't know if you seen them，
[Speaker 0]:  but theyve become very popular recently。
[Speaker 0]:  many people have noticed that the word pizza appears several times in epsteen's emails。
[Speaker 0]:  it appears in some very strange contexts，
[Speaker 0]:  like after you take this medicine，
[Speaker 0]:  we'll wash our hands。
[Speaker 0]:  and then we eve pizza and a grape soda。
[Speaker 0]:  that's all coded language，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  the fact that it appears several times is very strange。
[Speaker 0]:  first。
[Speaker 0]:  let me give you a recap of why these documents were released in the first place。
[Speaker 0]:  it's because after the estein transparency ahe was passed，
[Speaker 0]:  it had to go into effect because it's a law，
[Speaker 0]:  if the DOJ doesn't comply，
[Speaker 0]:  they could be violating the law。
[Speaker 0]:  and in fact，
[Speaker 0]:  they already have，
[Speaker 0]:  in the end，
[Speaker 0]:  over three million pages were released，
[Speaker 0]:  along with over two thousand videos and one hundred eighty thousand images。
[Speaker 0]:  it also covered many things，
[Speaker 0]:  including the four at a case，
[Speaker 0]:  the new york case，
[Speaker 0]:  the maxwell case and the prison death investigation in an unprecedented number of pages。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  it was a catastrophic failure in terms of privacy protection。
[Speaker 0]:  two lawyers who specifically represent absteenes victims，
[Speaker 0]:  have quickly warn the department of justice，
[Speaker 0]:  saying you spend so much manpopower resources covering up up priprivacy of these victims。
[Speaker 0]:  and then you find that after these documents were released，
[Speaker 0]:  it's the most serious violation of victim privacy in american history。
[Speaker 0]:  you can't just describe this situation as incompetence。
[Speaker 0]:  it's almost as if they did it intentionally exposing all these victims and releasing the names of people who were clearly accomplishes are involved in these transactions。
[Speaker 0]:  it would have been better to just use the eye reducted。
[Speaker 0]:  clearly，
[Speaker 0]:  their handling of this matter resulted in a disastrous outcome。
[Speaker 0]:  these are two lawyers who specialized defending these victims in this IPL case，
[Speaker 0]:  helping them sue these celebrities in APS。
[Speaker 0]:  these two lawyers came forward to say this。
[Speaker 0]:  and at the same time，
[Speaker 0]:  you should know that the ipo document law actually requires you to disclose all documents。
[Speaker 0]:  but in fact，
[Speaker 0]:  we are still missing two point five million documents。
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  we are still missing two point five million，
[Speaker 0]:  actually only three point five million have been released so far。
[Speaker 0]:  so the withholding of these documents makes people think that recently，
[Speaker 0]:  because the three million documents released recently are so shocking。
[Speaker 0]:  there is too much that is indecent and disgusting。
[Speaker 0]:  and after reading them，
[Speaker 0]:  it has actually affected the global political arena。
[Speaker 0]:  and global elites。
[Speaker 0]:  it's just that in the united states，
[Speaker 0]:  our government is basically shameless。
[Speaker 0]:  now everyone is pretending that nothing happened。
[Speaker 0]:  but in fact，
[Speaker 0]:  you can see that other countries like norway，
[Speaker 0]:  the UK and france have all been affected，
[Speaker 0]:  including checaassvvokia slovenia。
[Speaker 1]:  right now，
[Speaker 0]:  many people are questioning whether the two point five million documents you withheld or even worse than the three million。
[Speaker 0]:  the current inferences that it definitely is because look how bad these three million are right，
[Speaker 0]:  exposing so much。
[Speaker 1]: 是的，
[Speaker 1]: 对个，
[Speaker 0]: 这个这这个这个 this basically implicates all the elally classes in europe in america doesn't make all the scandalous details of this case are revealed。
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  this brings us back to the pizzagay conspiracy theory we mentioned at the beginning。
[Speaker 0]:  this is exactly the tenth anniversary of the pizza gay conspiracy theory，
[Speaker 0]:  and in this boston document，
[Speaker 0]:  the appearance of a large number of specific words has led many people to believe that they should apologize to those q and non people who promoted pizza gay back then，
[Speaker 0]:  because they actually said some things correctly。
[Speaker 0]:  this was the crisis related email that triggered the pizza gate conspiracy theory and cuanon has been supporting this，
[Speaker 0]:  saying this is better than a chinese cookie。
[Speaker 0]:  see you later。
[Speaker 0]:  let's go for pizza and grape soda。
[Speaker 0]:  again。
[Speaker 0]:  quote，
[Speaker 0]:  no one else can understand the phrase。
[Speaker 0]:  pizza and grape soda was sent to abstein by someone else。
[Speaker 0]:  if you look at it alone，
[Speaker 0]:  you might think it's normal right？
[Speaker 0]:  two good friends after finishing something going to eat pizza and drink soda isn't that normal。
[Speaker 0]:  but if you look at abstein，
[Speaker 0]:  he actually takes very good care of his body，
[Speaker 0]:  he's a wealthy person and people in that class generally pay a lot of attention to their bodies and diet for someone like him to eat pizza and grape soda is a bit far fetched。
[Speaker 0]:  but if you look at his physique，
[Speaker 0]:  you can see that he probably doesn't eat pizza every day。
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  someone who eats pizza every day would look like trumper BG，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  it's definitely coded language，
[Speaker 0]:  and you wouldn't get tired of eating the same thing every day，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  it's very strange that he would eat that every day，
[Speaker 0]:  then time recently did a program which just came out where he said that in the unsealed judicial document，
[Speaker 0]:  the word pizza was mentioned nenearly one day right unususually frequency made him revalue with the pizza gate conspiracy theory。
[Speaker 0]:  you know，
[Speaker 0]:  he's a right wing online celebrity back when he was at fox news，
[Speaker 0]:  he thought that those who talked about pizzgate were crazy，
[Speaker 0]:  mentally ill people who believed in conspiracy theories。
[Speaker 0]:  but after reading the documents，
[Speaker 0]:  he said，
[Speaker 0]:  oh，
[Speaker 0]:  my god，
[Speaker 0]:  i'm starting to rethink this。
[Speaker 0]:  now，
[Speaker 0]:  the most crucial piece of texas。
[Speaker 0]:  here，
[Speaker 0]:  i'll show you a screen shot。
[Speaker 0]:  this is a conversation between epstein and his doctor。
[Speaker 0]:  the doctor's name is harry fish，
[Speaker 0]:  and he's a urologist。
[Speaker 0]:  he was prescribing medication for a rectile disfunction to abstein。
[Speaker 0]:  you know，
[Speaker 0]:  epstein was probably older something，
[Speaker 0]:  and he had a rectile disfunction。
[Speaker 0]:  he needed this medication for someone who is so obsessed with sex，
[Speaker 0]:  and so enthusiastic about ppdophilia having this condition was very painful for him。
[Speaker 0]:  so after he took that medication，
[Speaker 0]:  the doctor just hold into wash his hands after using the medication。
[Speaker 0]:  and then we went to eat pizza and grape soda。
[Speaker 0]:  you can see that the pizza fries and grapsoda your correspond to the email you just saw earlier，
[Speaker 0]:  but this part appears in a screen shot of a conversation。
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  he said，
[Speaker 0]:  you can get this medication soon，
[Speaker 0]:  call him。
[Speaker 0]:  and then after calling him after you use this medication，
[Speaker 0]:  wash your hands，
[Speaker 0]:  and then we'll go in pizza，
[Speaker 0]:  huh grape soda，
[Speaker 0]: 还有好的 think about it。
[Speaker 0]:  after taking medication for a rectile disfunction，
[Speaker 0]:  why would you go eat pizza？
[Speaker 0]:  shouldn't you be doing other things？
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  you should be doing things you enjoy doing right？
[Speaker 0]:  so you can see this is clearly a coded message。
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  um so it's no wonder people are suspicious right when you've taken the medication and are ready to have sex。
[Speaker 0]:  what does eating pizza mean？
[Speaker 0]:  basically，
[Speaker 0]:  i think everyone pretty much understands what's going on。
[Speaker 0]:  you can see the logical chain here，
[Speaker 0]:  then he said on the show that khan said that given his notorious history of sex crimes and also his use of code for illegal activities because he himself was communicating with these intelligence organizations，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  helping to smubble weapons and getting these wealthy and influential people to invest in these israeli companies involved in national defence。
[Speaker 0]:  so you can see that this jay do on is a very clear coded message。
[Speaker 0]:  that's why PG is relevant again。
[Speaker 0]:  this reminds people of the prodesy email leaite。
[Speaker 0]:  there was exposed ten years ago，
[Speaker 0]:  which included things like a hot dog with forty thousand dollars，
[Speaker 0]:  that's very unnatural。
[Speaker 0]:  you know，
[Speaker 0]:  a costco。
[Speaker 0]:  we buy a hot dog and soda for less than two dollars。
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  one dollar and fifty cents a。
[Speaker 0]:  while ago，
[Speaker 0]:  the party and national leaders just ate four hot dogs in kell，
[Speaker 0]:  and you held this founing of the party and nation conference is very cheap。
[Speaker 0]:  um then let's look at this comic pizza incident。
[Speaker 0]:  there was a pizza shop called comment，
[Speaker 0]:  pingpong a man believing in cuanon went there with a gun and shot at a hard drive。
[Speaker 0]:  but what's very strange according to news reports is that this man was killed by police in north carolina shortly before these documents were released。
[Speaker 0]:  this is something they mentioned in the program today，
[Speaker 0]:  which is very interesting。
[Speaker 0]:  also，
[Speaker 0]:  there's the involvement of bar who was the head of the deal j during the trum administration estein privately referred to bar as ACIA person because bar had worked for the CIA。
[Speaker 0]:  but when he was at the DOJ，
[Speaker 0]:  he wasn't in charge of the CIA，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  so the influence of bar on this matter was very significant consider that bars father was one of eptien's lawyers，
[Speaker 0]:  and under his tenure，
[Speaker 0]:  abstein died in prison，
[Speaker 0]:  supposedly by suicide。
[Speaker 0]:  but we know there are many unanswered questions surrounding this case，
[Speaker 0]:  and it hasn't been truly resolved to this day。
[Speaker 0]:  furthermore，
[Speaker 0]:  mike pomppalo had a plan to assassinjujulian asonge。
[Speaker 0]:  you know，
[Speaker 0]:  who a sounge is right。
[Speaker 0]:  the wiickleague sky he was trying to cover up the true source of the democratic party email leaks，
[Speaker 0]:  because he felt this action was awaited deeply control the intelligence leagues related to aps。
[Speaker 0]:  it's basically generally accepted now that APS is an acset of an intelligence agency，
[Speaker 0]:  and it uses black malto control，
[Speaker 0]:  powerful people aglobally，
[Speaker 0]:  especially its relationship with the former israeli prime minister and related organizations。
[Speaker 0]:  and in these emails，
[Speaker 0]:  it also exposed something else that he once ran a company called liquid funding limited，
[Speaker 0]:  which specialized in selling，
[Speaker 0]:  cos that led to the two thousand eight financial crisis before bear sternts collapsed。
[Speaker 0]:  he accurally hedged his assets and closed his company getting out completely unscaed。
[Speaker 0]:  this has led to a new conspiracy theory，
[Speaker 0]:  suggesting that epstein actually contributed to the two thousand eight financial crisis，
[Speaker 0]:  specifically that he wanted to trigger the crisis through this method。
[Speaker 0]:  of course，
[Speaker 0]:  this conspiracy theory is a bit ar fetched，
[Speaker 0]:  but many people are questioning this now because he did run his own company that specifically sold sedios。
[Speaker 1]:  okay，
[Speaker 0]:  then there's the issue of this。
[Speaker 0]:  i don't know if you saw that very popular image on twitter for a while about the angle，
[Speaker 0]:  sex and conservative culture。
[Speaker 0]:  you probably haven't seen that new image，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  so what impact did this have on america's allies specifically the UK？
[Speaker 0]:  firstly，
[Speaker 0]:  there's the starmer government in the UK，
[Speaker 0]:  because you know，
[Speaker 0]:  i actually did a program about this。
[Speaker 0]:  at the time。
[Speaker 0]:  this guy，
[Speaker 0]:  he was the british ambassador to the US。
[Speaker 0]:  his name was peter mandeleson。
[Speaker 0]:  he could be considered a kinmaker in british politics。
[Speaker 0]:  similar to the position of leoubuweway，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  he basically helped install most of the british prime ministers before the abstein emails were exposed。
[Speaker 0]:  some people were already questioning him asking why he had such a close relationship with abstein and why he sent him emails and even taught him how to use sun，
[Speaker 0]:  sues art of war to whitewash himself。
[Speaker 0]:  he resigned because of this incident。
[Speaker 0]:  and then after these documents were recently exposed，
[Speaker 0]:  he got even more interesting。
[Speaker 0]:  firstly，
[Speaker 0]:  the documents shows that after the two thousand eight financial crisis，
[Speaker 0]:  he shared government documents in very sensitive details of UK cabinet discussions with abstein。
[Speaker 0]:  that's essentially treasm yeah，
[Speaker 0]:  sharing these confidential government documents with an unrelated wealthy american businessman。
[Speaker 0]:  and this business man might even be an asset of an israeli intelligence agency。
[Speaker 0]:  you're essentially selling out the ukky's national interests right year，
[Speaker 0]:  sharing it with big brother，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  and he shared it with the xa，
[Speaker 0]:  but more importortanhe，
[Speaker 0]:  he gave apple ly photo a photo of himself wearing a shirt and underwear standing next to a woman in a jade row。
[Speaker 0]:  it looked very uncycly。
[Speaker 0]:  you know，
[Speaker 0]:  these british people are very particular。
[Speaker 0]:  they want to appear very gentlemaningly in decent on the surface。
[Speaker 0]:  but after this photo was exposed，
[Speaker 0]:  it had a huge impact。
[Speaker 0]:  perhaps he intended this to be a photo for abstein，
[Speaker 0]:  in which case the meaning is quite obvious。
[Speaker 0]:  he's protecting his own people，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  so this has already had a significant impact on british politics when the information was leaked。
[Speaker 0]:  in late，
[Speaker 0]:  twenty twenty five，
[Speaker 0]:  he was forced to dismiss the ambassador to the us。
[Speaker 0]:  the prime minister had no choice but to do this。
[Speaker 0]:  then，
[Speaker 0]:  on february second of this year，
[Speaker 0]:  he announced his resignation from the house of lords and relinuish his perirage title。
[Speaker 0]:  his politiccareer basbasiccame came a complete end。
[Speaker 0]:  at the same time，
[Speaker 0]:  the british police officially launched a criminal investigation into the inappropriate conduct of the official。
[Speaker 0]:  the main focus of the investigation is whether he leave classified information，
[Speaker 0]:  because the email clearly shows that he first told apple about this hihighly confidential government document。
[Speaker 0]:  then the prime minister was forced to publicly apologize，
[Speaker 0]:  saying that he was also deceived and missled by mandeson's lies mandeleson at the time，
[Speaker 0]:  said he was missled by upstein。
[Speaker 0]:  they were both blaming each other，
[Speaker 0]:  saying they didn't expect the relationship between these two to be so dark and serious。
[Speaker 0]:  but you know，
[Speaker 0]:  once this kind of thing comes out，
[Speaker 0]:  your opposition will definitely attack you，
[Speaker 0]:  fiercely。
[Speaker 0]:  the opposition party said，
[Speaker 0]:  as a prime minister，
[Speaker 0]:  how can you be so weak，
[Speaker 0]:  naive and galbble？
[Speaker 0]:  you're someone who had frequent contact with a peaddoilile？
[Speaker 0]:  and you already knew about this relationship before yet，
[Speaker 0]:  you still chose him。
[Speaker 0]:  this shows that you have problems with your personal decisions，
[Speaker 0]:  and your decision making ability is questionable quoat。
[Speaker 0]:  the same time，
[Speaker 0]:  everyone demanded that the chief of staff be fired because the chief of staff recommended him saying that choosing mandeleson was absolutely no problem。
[Speaker 0]:  well，
[Speaker 0]:  anyway，
[Speaker 0]:  they were just throwing accusations at each other。
[Speaker 0]:  and we've seen a lot of that。
[Speaker 0]:  this is actually a major leadership crisis。
[Speaker 0]:  people will question whether your incompetent at the same time。
[Speaker 0]:  there's also someone like george mitchell，
[Speaker 0]:  the former US senator and architect of the northern ireland piece agreement，
[Speaker 0]:  who was disgrace because of the exposure of these details from twenty eleven to twenty thirteen after abstein had already been convicted，
[Speaker 0]:  he frequently communicated with him to arrange meetings。
[Speaker 0]:  as a result，
[Speaker 0]:  he resigned from his position at his mitchell institute，
[Speaker 0]:  and many public institutions also removed his name from various honorary projects because of the scandal。
[Speaker 0]:  there are also many accusations against trump，
[Speaker 0]:  but we won't go into detail here。
[Speaker 0]:  we've already discuss that in previous episodes。
[Speaker 0]:  the canadian prime minister，
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  didn't have extensive communication with upstein。
[Speaker 0]:  his name just appeared in the emails many times，
[Speaker 0]:  mainly because he subscribed to a daily international financial newsletter。
[Speaker 0]:  it's normal for his name to appear because he was the former governor of the bank of england and the bank of canada at that time，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  but his role in the london capital and financial scandal investigation was also mentioned，
[Speaker 0]:  even though he wasn't found guilty in that investigation，
[Speaker 0]:  that mainly many people are now saying his name also appeared in the apple documents。
[Speaker 0]:  but the investigation into his case was also mentioned。
[Speaker 0]:  i think this is actually okay for mark carney，
[Speaker 0]:  not not obvious as the others who were arranging meetings are going to his island for parties or something。
[Speaker 0]:  so i think this is fine，
[Speaker 0]:  if there wasn't this meeting，
[Speaker 0]:  it would be okay。
[Speaker 0]:  but if they maet and went to the island for a party that would be very bad，
[Speaker 0]:  the most serious cases，
[Speaker 0]:  the norwegian royal family，
[Speaker 0]:  the norwegian crown，
[Speaker 0]:  prinints，
[Speaker 0]:  contted，
[Speaker 0]:  ted stein and wanted to meet him，
[Speaker 0]:  wanted to have a party with him。
[Speaker 0]:  and this has led to the norwegian，
[Speaker 0]:  an royal family facing a lot of scrutiny。
[Speaker 0]:  this wong chifuncharacter he's involved with f three every day，
[Speaker 0]:  and his reputation is definitely not good。
[Speaker 0]:  meanwhile，
[Speaker 0]:  the former norwegian prime minister is under police investigation for serious corruption charges，
[Speaker 0]:  suspected of accepting gifts，
[Speaker 0]:  loans and other benefits。
[Speaker 0]:  this is a very serious accusation。
[Speaker 0]:  also，
[Speaker 0]:  the head of the world economic forum has been revealed，
[Speaker 0]:  have had numerous business dinners with him。
[Speaker 0]:  he admitted to regretting it，
[Speaker 0]:  but the world economic form m board has officially launched in investigation。
[Speaker 0]:  so you think that the world economic forum board，
[Speaker 0]:  it's essentially an organization of elites，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  who gets to give presentations and network at the world economic forum，
[Speaker 0]:  there are all eleeds from various fields。
[Speaker 0]:  and industries，
[Speaker 0]:  right。
[Speaker 0]:  this actually further deepens the distrust of these elites。
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  actually，
[Speaker 0]:  if we delve a little deeper，
[Speaker 0]:  it's a matter of identification。
[Speaker 0]:  we no longer feel that they are part of our group，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  we'll talk about this later。
[Speaker 0]:  there are also other politicians，
[Speaker 0]:  such as the former slavaoi and foreign minister，
[Speaker 0]:  who served as a national security advisor during the declassification period，
[Speaker 0]:  he had multiple conversations and meetings with f three and text messages revealed him saying，
[Speaker 0]:  things like the girls in kever beautiful and moscow has oil and girls esatura。
[Speaker 0]:  after saying this，
[Speaker 0]:  he resigned from his position as security advisor，
[Speaker 0]:  basically his career in government service ended，
[Speaker 0]:  there are also other key figures from various committees and platforms connected to apple's network。
[Speaker 0]:  they appear in this document。
[Speaker 0]:  it seems to be mainly focused on europe。
[Speaker 0]:  in america。
[Speaker 0]:  their circle is basically ruined。
[Speaker 0]:  the exposure of this incident has many additional implications。
[Speaker 0]:  on one hand，
[Speaker 0]:  it essentially creates a crisis for these economic organizations such as the world economic forum。
[Speaker 0]:  because if your leaders and CE os are extensively involved with such a pedophile and have various private contacts，
[Speaker 0]:  then isn't your global illeague dialogue platform just a globpepeapphilia dialogue platform。
[Speaker 0]:  and the key point is that abstein is very likely connected to，
[Speaker 0]:  as you just mentioned，
[Speaker 0]:  the two thousand eight financial crisis，
[Speaker 0]:  did he really withdraw before the collapse based on his own abilities？
[Speaker 0]:  or was he given 嗯 advancinformation，
[Speaker 0]:  if that's the case，
[Speaker 0]:  then wouldn't this economic form become a form where global leads collue to exploit ordinary people，
[Speaker 0]:  right would still trust you them？
[Speaker 0]:  yes。
[Speaker 0]:  so secondly，
[Speaker 0]:  this has caused a men's damage to the west discourse on human rights。
[Speaker 0]:  think about it。
[Speaker 0]:  these european and american leaders and royalty often use the human rights，
[Speaker 0]:  stick to attack other countries，
[Speaker 0]:  saying things like russia，
[Speaker 0]:  you don't have elections or you have elections。
[Speaker 0]:  but you're disguised the thoritarian regime，
[Speaker 0]:  a dictatorial state，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  china is also an authoritarian state，
[Speaker 0]:  and your human rights situation is worrying。
[Speaker 0]:  you should learn from our western countries。
[Speaker 0]:  we write a human rights white paper for you every year quonow。
[Speaker 0]:  i think other countries can write human rights，
[Speaker 0]:  white papers for these european and american countries too。
[Speaker 0]:  china has been writing them for a long time。
[Speaker 0]:  i remember they've been writing them for about twenty years。
[Speaker 0]:  they've been writing them today。
[Speaker 0]:  they are not only writing these，
[Speaker 0]:  but also writing about upstein。
[Speaker 0]:  this basically eliminates the moral high ground that they used to have。
[Speaker 0]:  you're not even on high ground anymore，
[Speaker 0]:  you're in a ditch。
[Speaker 0]:  what right？
[Speaker 0]:  do you have to use human rights to criticize other countries？
[Speaker 0]:  our government？
[Speaker 0]:  our american government has over thirty officials involved in the estain scandal。
[Speaker 0]:  all of them，
[Speaker 0]:  pedophiles，
[Speaker 0]:  yes。
[Speaker 0]:  what right？
[Speaker 0]:  do you have to criticize other countries？
[Speaker 0]:  the most crucial point is that a former british ambassador to the US directly send national secrets to abstein in private messages。
[Speaker 0]:  how can these intelligence networks trust each other anymore？
[Speaker 0]:  isn't there also a potential israspy acid here where any information we have actually goes to him？
[Speaker 0]:  okay，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  it's like israel has essentially high jacked，
[Speaker 0]:  the entire so called civilized world，
[Speaker 0]:  or even the western world，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  so you can understand why ah if you criticize israel on these platforms，
[Speaker 0]:  you'll face tremendous backlash for small channels like cars。
[Speaker 0]:  it's not a big deal。
[Speaker 0]:  but if you're an influential figure，
[Speaker 0]:  you'll definitely be targeted in attack。
[Speaker 0]:  if you're a politician，
[Speaker 0]:  you'll face a lot of this kind of competition，
[Speaker 0]:  your opponents will have a lot of funding from groups like ipc and the'll。
[Speaker 1]:  try to bring you down this situation in france is quite interesting。
[Speaker 0]:  after the abstein documents were leaked，
[Speaker 0]:  a rumour circulated online in france，
[Speaker 0]:  saying that this guy breer，
[Speaker 0]:  who was supposedly involved with abstein in this global trafficking network also died。
[Speaker 0]:  mysteriously in prison，
[Speaker 0]:  a suicide by hanging。
[Speaker 0]:  this is highly suspicious，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  no，
[Speaker 0]:  we don't believe it anymore。
[Speaker 0]:  i think nobody with an iq above double digits，
[Speaker 0]:  believes that abstein and many related individuals committed suicide。
[Speaker 0]:  nobody believes that it's nonsense。
[Speaker 0]:  so what kind of rumor emerged from this？
[Speaker 0]:  the rumor was that brewhad e email showing him promising to bring several boys to a party organized by president macron。
[Speaker 0]:  this has been proven to be hohox，
[Speaker 0]:  a fabricated rumour crecreated by fafake network，
[Speaker 0]:  possibly lked to russia。
[Speaker 0]:  it doesn't exist in the real files。
[Speaker 0]:  i searched for it and couldn't find it。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  you can see that the release of these abstein documents also involves a lot of information warfare。
[Speaker 0]:  the most crucial point is that the former israeli prime minister a hoodbrock discussing emails with abstein about the norwegian crown princess，
[Speaker 0]:  describing a bizarre wife，
[Speaker 0]:  hunting scenarioo。
[Speaker 0]:  this wife hunting scenario esessentially nt r netora，
[Speaker 0]:  a japanese term for couplding。
[Speaker 0]:  it seems that both bbrock epstein were particularly fond of this kind of thing。
[Speaker 0]:  at this point，
[Speaker 0]:  netonaahoo came out and posted on social media，
[Speaker 0]:  saying，
[Speaker 0]:  look at the unusually close relationship between broack and epstein。
[Speaker 0]:  this precisely proves that abstein was not a most sad agent，
[Speaker 0]:  otherwise he wouldn't openly associate with political opponents。
[Speaker 0]:  so obviously wouldn't that expose him quote。
[Speaker 0]:  that's his point。
[Speaker 0]:  do you think this guy nedeniaho's argument is also very strange，
[Speaker 0]:  that is to say，
[Speaker 0]:  someone who openly associates with abstein in public is precisely not the person who was centispy on him。
[Speaker 0]:  is that the logic it's completely untennable？
[Speaker 0]:  and then you can see that the slovian national security adviser also resigned because of the AP documents。
[Speaker 0]:  but you can see that in the united states，
[Speaker 0]:  you haven't seen a single politician resign because of the apple document scandal，
[Speaker 0]:  even a scandal like lunicic directly lying on ATV show in the past。
[Speaker 0]:  any politician with a shread of shame would have resigned，
[Speaker 0]:  but now nothing everyone acks like nothing。
[Speaker 0]:  entrumpmpeven came out。
[Speaker 0]:  he can told the media that the release of the ip o documents precisely proves his innocenyou。
[Speaker 0]:  you can see to what extent he can。
[Speaker 0]:  gas light directly to the camera。
[Speaker 0]:  and then we get to the celebrity section。
[Speaker 0]:  we talked about bill gates last time，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  but recently，
[Speaker 0]:  i don't know if you seen twitter，
[Speaker 0]:  but EMK and read hoffmen are fighting on twitter，
[Speaker 0]:  then emk posted this tweet，
[Speaker 0]:  saying that nobody fought harder or more fiercely than me for the release of the ap documents。
[Speaker 0]:  he said that now these celebrities and politicians once they are found in the apple documents，
[Speaker 0]:  especially you leftists will adopt this strategy first admade，
[Speaker 0]:  nothing second，
[Speaker 0]:  deny everything and third attack。
[Speaker 0]:  others saying that it's your problem that you're in that document，
[Speaker 0]:  but he's actually telling the truth。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  he himself also used this trick，
[Speaker 0]:  he and read hofffman did exactly this and old eagal。
[Speaker 0]:  i want to ask you a question。
[Speaker 0]:  can you guess which celebrity appears most frequently in the iphone three documents？
[Speaker 0]:  well，
[Speaker 0]:  i thought you were talking about a nwn。
[Speaker 0]:  and that now is definitely upininname me need desk as for famous people。
[Speaker 0]:  you just said that trumps name appeared many times，
[Speaker 0]:  and i remember clinton's name also appeared quite a lot，
[Speaker 0]:  but you also said earlier that some economists only appeared because estetime and read their newspapers。
[Speaker 0]:  so i don't know if some entrepreneurs might have a certain connection，
[Speaker 0]:  but not that close。
[Speaker 0]:  but since abstein didn't read his newspaper，
[Speaker 0]:  use his products，
[Speaker 0]:  i guess it's not ylaon musque。
[Speaker 0]:  the number one rank person is not ill on musque。
[Speaker 0]:  let me do a test for everyone。
[Speaker 0]:  let's guess，
[Speaker 0]:  let's do a vote。
[Speaker 0]:  let's do an interactive poll。
[Speaker 0]:  okay，
[Speaker 0]:  who is d？
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  let me posit first。
[Speaker 0]:  hey，
[Speaker 0]:  could it be bill？
[Speaker 0]:  gates，
[Speaker 0]:  no，
[Speaker 0]:  no，
[Speaker 0]:  let me send it out to everyone。
[Speaker 0]:  let's do a poll。
[Speaker 0]:  now do a poll。
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  give a few options。
[Speaker 0]:  trump must be there and then read huffman，
[Speaker 0]:  if i were to choose，
[Speaker 0]:  i definitely wouldn't choose trump，
[Speaker 0]:  because you just said his name appeared many times，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  so if you guess，
[Speaker 0]:  is the first intuition him。
[Speaker 0]:  but since you said it appeared thousands of times or hundreds of times，
[Speaker 0]:  i forgot，
[Speaker 0]:  then it's definitely not him。
[Speaker 0]:  i think it should be gates here。
[Speaker 0]:  there might be this。
[Speaker 0]:  what's it called？
[Speaker 0]:  you're using a game theory approach to think about this problem。
[Speaker 0]:  let's see how everyone votes。
[Speaker 0]:  let me quickly cast my vote，
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  because you just said the trump appeared many times。
[Speaker 0]:  so i think it's probably not him。
[Speaker 0]:  i saw someone say lee u and chow，
[Speaker 0]:  not she。
[Speaker 0]:  i don't even know who one is，
[Speaker 0]:  but i'm not necessarily right，
[Speaker 0]:  because i'm just guessing。
[Speaker 0]:  we're all just guessing just treated as entertainment。
[Speaker 0]:  okay，
[Speaker 0]:  you should know that president's eyes english is not his strong point，
[Speaker 0]:  so he would have to bring a translator to communicate with upstein，
[Speaker 0]:  which wouldn't be very convenient。
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  maybe the translator would go to that island to play。
[Speaker 0]:  but all be，
[Speaker 0]:  don't don't know you've been following the media coverage，
[Speaker 0]:  but i glamped out of these past couple of days。
[Speaker 0]:  and it seems like one of the media outlets is already saying that she jumping actually appeared in the upsteined documents。
[Speaker 0]:  i don't know how they connected that，
[Speaker 0]:  but i've seen some self media outlets using that as a headline um，
[Speaker 0]:  but it's possible because you epstein wasn't bad。
[Speaker 0]:  i mean，
[Speaker 0]:  i always say that because he always talked about international politics，
[Speaker 0]:  and i think that major world leaders，
[Speaker 0]:  you can say it's highly likely that they'all appeared in these documents at some point。
[Speaker 0]:  but if it's really widespread and affects many people，
[Speaker 0]:  then that means the problem is quite serious。
[Speaker 0]:  the voting stopped at one hundred votes。
[Speaker 0]:  i saw that someone in ukicia johwas，
[Speaker 0]:  john uxia，
[Speaker 0]:  john uxia was john uxsia abroad。
[Speaker 0]:  yeah，
[Speaker 0]:  down because of the abstein case。
[Speaker 0]:  no，
[Speaker 0]:  no，
[Speaker 0]:  john yuxi is，
[Speaker 0]:  oh，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  i saw someone say that he couldn't even arrange for someone to get into peking university's crystal team。
[Speaker 0]:  there's a joke here。
[Speaker 0]:  a lethe email showed that epstein tried to help someone get into peking university，
[Speaker 0]:  but he was ultimately rejected。
[Speaker 0]:  he couldn't get it done。
[Speaker 0]:  um so basically this is about the western political circle versus the east asian political circle。
[Speaker 0]:  they're not the same circle。
[Speaker 0]:  okay，
[Speaker 0]:  okay，
[Speaker 0]:  one hundred one votes。
[Speaker 0]:  now let's end the voting fifty percent of the audience voted for trump twenty three percent for bill gates，
[Speaker 0]:  twenty two percent for read hoffman and four percent for ylhfse。
[Speaker 0]:  wow，
[Speaker 0]:  i have to say this is the power of collective intelligence，
[Speaker 0]:  once again proving the superiority colcolletive tive intellience ence。
[Speaker 0]:  let's look at statitistis onoh perperent trutrumso。
[Speaker 0]:  we can't use reverse thinking，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  trump is still first thirty eight thousand times，
[Speaker 0]:  thirty eight thousand times。
[Speaker 0]:  rank second is read hoffmen with two thousand six hundred fifty eight mensions。
[Speaker 0]:  look，
[Speaker 0]:  how far trump is ahead of the second place by in order of magnitude third places。
[Speaker 0]:  bill gates fourth is peter till and fifth is elon mask。
[Speaker 0]:  i added musk to the list to the connection betwtwen en MMK rered hofffen，
[Speaker 0]:  but actually PT appeared the fourth most times hm m，
[Speaker 0]:  there's read hoffmen。
[Speaker 0]:  you know，
[Speaker 0]:  he found it lked in。
[Speaker 0]:  oh，
[Speaker 0]:  okay。
[Speaker 0]:  ganiel on musque were both members of the paypal mafia at the beginning。
[Speaker 0]:  they cofounded paypal together and then successfully exited，
[Speaker 0]:  right。
[Speaker 0]:  so they were part of that first wave of initial capital accumulation。
[Speaker 0]:  then the two of them became super rich，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  filthy rich，
[Speaker 0]:  and then they started accusing each other。
[Speaker 0]:  first，
[Speaker 0]:  musk said on twitter that hoffman had had gto eabsteen's private island。
[Speaker 0]:  then musk said，
[Speaker 0]:  read the biggest difference between you and me is that you went and i didn't，
[Speaker 0]:  in fact，
[Speaker 0]:  you went several times。
[Speaker 0]:  aren't you just carrying out the third step of the plan？
[Speaker 0]:  musk just mentioned，
[Speaker 0]:  which is to accuse other people quote，
[Speaker 0]:  but muask himself wasn't telling the truth either。
[Speaker 0]:  musk said that epstein tried to use the fact that hoffman had been to the island to invite musk，
[Speaker 0]:  which only made him more disgusted and distance stehim from abstein。
[Speaker 0]:  he even showed an email from abstein in twenty fourteen e's evidence hoffmanen immediately posted a screenshot。
[Speaker 0]:  this screenshot，
[Speaker 0]:  which we shared with you last week is from twenty twelve when musk emailed abstein asking，
[Speaker 0]:  which day or night his island party was the crazist then hoffmanman also countered with his past critical remarks about trump and epsteen's documents，
[Speaker 0]:  starting a frrenzed fact checking campaign。
[Speaker 0]:  paffman man responded that his contact with abstein was actually to raise funds for the MIT media lab，
[Speaker 0]:  the mit media lab。
[Speaker 0]:  i don't know if you know he's a very famous lab called media lab，
[Speaker 0]:  which also does i related work。
[Speaker 0]:  he said that this action was not a private relationship，
[Speaker 0]:  but he did admit it was a mistake and that he regretted it。
[Speaker 0]:  he even made public his meeting schedule with abstein。
[Speaker 0]:  you know，
[Speaker 0]:  hoffmanman is a major donor to the democratic party and a major enemy of the republican party。
[Speaker 0]:  right 's prpractically number one eneenow。
[Speaker 0]:  these actually atatacking each each and there's actually a partisan struggle involved。
[Speaker 0]:  another crucial point is that reed hoffman en actually helped open eye get through the transitional period after elon musk left。
[Speaker 0]:  and now for this success，
[Speaker 0]:  hoffman is a very important driving force。
[Speaker 0]:  okay。
[Speaker 0]:  so you can see that the field between these two exists in many areas dot，
[Speaker 0]:  if you're unfamiliar with a fuebetween en en en i and muse，
[Speaker 0]:  you can search for a previous episode。
[Speaker 0]:  one。
[Speaker 0]:  did that specifically discuss this matter？
[Speaker 0]:  then regarding bill gates，
[Speaker 0]:  we actually talked about this before，
[Speaker 0]:  in the last episode where estein tried to black mail him him the emails。
[Speaker 0]:  he actually send it to the drafts folder and didn't send it to gates，
[Speaker 0]:  but it exposed many details，
[Speaker 0]:  including bill gates，
[Speaker 0]:  having a relationship with a russian woman，
[Speaker 0]:  presumably a prostitute，
[Speaker 0]:  contracting the STD and then trying to drug his wife to help retreat the STD。
[Speaker 1]: 嗯，
[Speaker 0]:  his wife recently appeared on a podcast for an interview，
[Speaker 0]:  and the reporter was very direct asking her。
[Speaker 0]:  what are your thoughts on the recent release of these abstein documents？
[Speaker 0]:  the wife initially expressed that it was hearbreaking，
[Speaker 0]:  saying that no girl should be subjected to what abstein and those around him did。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  for her personally these details，
[Speaker 0]:  including the recently leagued emails，
[Speaker 0]:  stred up very painful memories from her marriage because she had already advised bill gates to stay away from estein because abstein wasn't a good person。
[Speaker 0]:  she had met him once，
[Speaker 0]:  but felt that he shouldn't associate with him anymore。
[Speaker 0]:  that was actually a very important reason from mlindgates and bill gates divorce。
[Speaker 0]:  the reason was related to abstein，
[Speaker 0]:  and bill gates also had an extra marital affair，
[Speaker 0]:  which someone also exposed。
[Speaker 0]:  there was a woman at bill gates。
[Speaker 0]:  investment foundation，
[Speaker 0]:  who had a romantic relationship with him。
[Speaker 0]:  abstein also knew about this and was involved to some extent for his wife。
[Speaker 0]:  this was unacceptable，
[Speaker 0]:  and it was already a preexisting issue。
[Speaker 0]:  then during an interview，
[Speaker 0]:  he said the BG should come out and respond to these issues that BG should address this matter head on。
[Speaker 0]:  looking back，
[Speaker 0]:  his decision to leave bill gates was actually a very correct choice，
[Speaker 0]:  very wise。
[Speaker 0]:  first of all，
[Speaker 0]:  the divorce，
[Speaker 0]:  the divorce lawsuit，
[Speaker 0]:  or rather the division of assets was very successful。
[Speaker 0]:  and on the other hand，
[Speaker 0]:  he avoided being implicated in the obsteined scandal because he could have said at the time，
[Speaker 0]:  i'm distcing myself from gates because of this。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  in this batch of IP documents，
[Speaker 0]:  there's someone who appeared that really surprise me，
[Speaker 0]:  and that's chomski don't don't if you know this person，
[Speaker 0]:  the link was known chomsky。
[Speaker 0]:  yes。
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  he is a very famous linguisst m。
[Speaker 0]:  it t he's active in this circle of public intellectuexprespressing，
[Speaker 0]:  his opinions and ticizing the government。
[Speaker 0]:  he's a very stage left tween progressive。
[Speaker 0]:  his criticisms of the government are based on values，
[Speaker 0]:  criticizing it from a moral standpoint。
[Speaker 0]:  from this perspective，
[Speaker 0]:  many people have always considered him a kind of conscience of academia viewing him through this lens。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  you see，
[Speaker 0]:  he's also somewhat problematic。
[Speaker 0]:  you'll find that apple sought his advice on how to deal with negative media attention。
[Speaker 0]:  this was in february twenty nineteen chomsky's response。
[Speaker 0]:  of course，
[Speaker 0]:  it wasn't sent directly by chomsky，
[Speaker 0]:  but really in fem person was that ignoring public concern about these sexual crimes is like a vultuture craving or response expressing disstain for the hiysterical reactions。
[Speaker 0]:  regarding the abuse of women，
[Speaker 0]:  this statement，
[Speaker 0]:  especially within the left twin and progressicircles in the west，
[Speaker 0]:  caused very strong dissatisfaction。
[Speaker 0]:  actually，
[Speaker 0]:  you can see that even scholars like chomsky when interacting with people like upstein find it difficult not to be charmed by him，
[Speaker 0]:  because this person is very insightful into human nature。
[Speaker 1]:  he knows very well how to build very close relationships with powerful and influential people。
[Speaker 0]:  for example，
[Speaker 0]:  with bill gates，
[Speaker 0]:  you can see that even someone as intelligence，
[Speaker 0]:  gates fell l epsteine strap。
[Speaker 0]:  why would he need to rely on epin ine to find these russian oliberks？
[Speaker 0]:  he had other avenues，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  so you can see that this is where esteine's unique ability lies chomsky once wrote a letter of recommendation，
[Speaker 0]:  saying that epstein was a very valuable close friend。
[Speaker 0]:  and in fact，
[Speaker 0]:  abstein also donated a lot of money to MIT chomsky affection and special regard for him might also be related to these donations。
[Speaker 0]:  after all，
[Speaker 0]:  you can't bite the hand that feeds you in one report，
[Speaker 0]:  chomkeadadmted ted that accouncounllink to epstein received two hundred seventy thousand dollars used to handle the distribution of joint funds from his first marriage，
[Speaker 0]:  although he insisted that not a single penny came directly from abstein。
[Speaker 0]:  the account was related to epstein。
[Speaker 0]:  now chom ski is recovering in brazil after recently suffering a stroke。
[Speaker 0]:  it's difficult for him to provide oral or written responses。
[Speaker 0]:  he is ninety seven years old this year。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  the emergence of these documents has indeed greatly affected his image，
[Speaker 0]:  making people feel that he has tarnished his reputation in his later years，
[Speaker 0]:  although there is no evidence to show that chomsky participated in estesteine sexual criminal activities，
[Speaker 0]:  his praise of abstein as a very valuable close friend praising his boundless less curiosity。
[Speaker 0]:  and profound inside is indeed regrettable。
[Speaker 0]:  but all e do，
[Speaker 0]:  you know who is the only person whose reputation has risen in this wave of abstain document leaks question？
[Speaker 0]:  mark，
[Speaker 0]:  i see，
[Speaker 0]:  it's already shown on the next page of your summary。
[Speaker 0]:  dut。
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  it's norman thingle steam。
[Speaker 0]:  this story is quite poononant。
[Speaker 0]:  first of all，
[Speaker 0]:  in this email，
[Speaker 0]:  he could see that there was a journalist who actually wanted to help connect gale，
[Speaker 0]:  mamaxwell and abstein。
[Speaker 0]:  he said that epstein actually admired him and wanted to have an indepth x change with him，
[Speaker 0]:  wanted to meet him，
[Speaker 0]:  discuss academics with him and even consider donating money to their school or something like that。
[Speaker 0]:  this person directly replied to the email，
[Speaker 0]:  saying that if abstein put your fifteen year old daughter in this situation，
[Speaker 0]:  you wouldn't call him a friend。
[Speaker 0]:  and hope that you would strangle abstein and dirtihuwitz。
[Speaker 0]:  this rshhuwitz is estesteen's defence lawyer and also a very famous criminal defence lawyer and academia。
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  you know，
[Speaker 0]:  we've talked about him before。
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  we talked about him before 我操。
[Speaker 0]:  he replied to this person's email，
[Speaker 0]:  directly slapping upstein in the face，
[Speaker 0]:  directly humiliating him on the spot。
[Speaker 0]:  this person wanted to connect them，
[Speaker 0]:  and he directly replied，
[Speaker 0]:  you should strangle them。
[Speaker 0]:  and even seiceed four other people，
[Speaker 0]:  you can see that this person's personality is very strong。
[Speaker 0]:  he's actually a jewish scholar，
[Speaker 0]:  and his family actually survive the holiccost。
[Speaker 0]:  but you should know that he is a stunchch opponent of xyonism。
[Speaker 0]:  he has published several books，
[Speaker 0]:  interested friends can read them。
[Speaker 0]:  he discusses why the later israeli government completely weaponized the holocost politicizing it。
[Speaker 0]:  turning this issue into something that makes it difficult for you to criticize israel actions in these european and american countries。
[Speaker 0]:  if you criticize them，
[Speaker 0]:  you will be labeled as an antty sumite。
[Speaker 0]:  this has led to a situation where，
[Speaker 0]:  in in countries like the united states，
[Speaker 0]:  germany and the united kingdom。
[Speaker 0]:  any action they take in the middle east is met with a blind eye，
[Speaker 0]:  and they even provide them with weapons and funds。
[Speaker 0]:  this norman fingle steam。
[Speaker 0]:  this person fiercely criticized this matter。
[Speaker 0]:  he critized the influence of the israeli lobby group and why it affects so many politicians in the united states。
[Speaker 0]:  all of whom can only praise policies，
[Speaker 0]:  ies cannot criticize。
[Speaker 1]:  them IMI。
[Speaker 0]:  you know，
[Speaker 0]:  in academia，
[Speaker 0]:  if you do this，
[Speaker 0]:  you will suffer very serious consequences。
[Speaker 0]:  yes。
[Speaker 0]:  do you know what the consequences were？
[Speaker 0]:  uh well，
[Speaker 0]:  that's right。
[Speaker 0]:  i saw it，
[Speaker 0]:  even old mah，
[Speaker 0]:  referring to modm the host of them show asked if this person was still alive。
[Speaker 0]:  yes。
[Speaker 0]:  what were the consequences for him？
[Speaker 0]:  he still alive，
[Speaker 0]:  but he never got tenure in his life。
[Speaker 0]:  wow，
[Speaker 0]:  you know，
[Speaker 0]:  in the academic circle tenure is the ultimate goal for many people who work in academia once you get tenure。
[Speaker 0]:  the school can't easily fire you，
[Speaker 0]:  you have a secure job，
[Speaker 0]:  and your salary will be very good。
[Speaker 0]:  you also get vacation time every year and can even take a sabbatical where you can spend a year doing what you want academically。
[Speaker 0]:  he was completely fine at the time when he was teaching at depul university，
[Speaker 0]:  the department and college level review committees all voted in favor of his tenure application。
[Speaker 0]:  there were absolutely no problems，
[Speaker 0]:  which shows that acacadec ability，
[Speaker 0]:  including teaching，
[Speaker 0]:  was fine。
[Speaker 0]:  finally，
[Speaker 0]:  at the school level，
[Speaker 0]:  the board of trustees and the university president overturned it。
[Speaker 0]:  they directly overturned his tenure application，
[Speaker 0]:  even though everything belows fine。
[Speaker 0]:  what was the reason？
[Speaker 0]:  the reason was that dirshetlaunched a long term semear campaign against this scholar，
[Speaker 0]:  essentially a kind of orchestrated campaign to persecute him。
[Speaker 0]:  he went to all the schools that could grant tenure and pressure them，
[Speaker 0]:  saying you absolutely cannot give this person tenure。
[Speaker 0]:  this person is problematic。
[Speaker 0]:  he actually dare to criticize israel。
[Speaker 0]:  he actually dare to oppose jewish scienism quote，
[Speaker 0]:  but ironically dershuutz himself jewish，
[Speaker 0]:  so you can't say he's anti summittic，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  so i think i should criticize more right to avoid this。
[Speaker 0]:  you only have one percent，
[Speaker 0]:  so you can't be at much，
[Speaker 0]:  but kaihoon jews have been around for one thousand years。
[Speaker 0]:  so you have to know that dirshutz actually has a very big influence in the academic circle，
[Speaker 0]:  and he also has connections in the political and business world，
[Speaker 0]:  including his close relationship with estetime。
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  it is。
[Speaker 0]:  this is incredibly surprising because as a renowned legal scholar，
[Speaker 0]:  a especially one who was once a leading figure in the american legal community，
[Speaker 0]:  he should have some principles that transend current events and situations。
[Speaker 0]:  he should have a certain sense of justice。
[Speaker 0]:  do you know where the conflict between him and allen dirshu？
[Speaker 0]:  it's mainly originated joshutz published a book called the case for israel，
[Speaker 0]:  a strong defence of israel's actions in the middle east，
[Speaker 0]:  including its occupation of certain territories。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  this professor systematically criticized the book，
[Speaker 0]:  saying that it represented numerous spats and even plejerzed rlier materials from then on dishuwitz began a long and fierce public attack on him，
[Speaker 0]:  calling him an andy semde unworthy of being called the scholar，
[Speaker 0]:  even wrocolumns in the media to smear him during his tenure review，
[Speaker 0]:  actively sending lengthy materials to the department，
[Speaker 0]:  head and school administrators to lobby against him。
[Speaker 0]:  the department and college did not heat these materials and still voted to approve his tenure，
[Speaker 0]:  but at the university's board level，
[Speaker 0]:  they ultimately refused to grant him tenure。
[Speaker 0]:  it can be said that allan dshchwitwithis orchestrated external political interference was the most crucial factor in the schools final decision to deny him tenure。
[Speaker 0]: 他们 an article published on counterpunch directly stated that drchhutz's rejection of fkle steams tenure was a major victory for harvard law school，
[Speaker 0]:  professor allen drchhutz，
[Speaker 0]:  and it detailed how he pressure the administration，
[Speaker 0]:  the media and donors to exert immense political pressure on the university。
[Speaker 0]:  this is very unfortunate，
[Speaker 0]:  because drshhuwitz，
[Speaker 0]:  or rather dirhuwitz gave excellent master classes in beijing。
[Speaker 0]:  he was both talented and highly skilled。
[Speaker 0]:  this is a great loss。
[Speaker 0]:  then we enter the realm of financial world purges。
[Speaker 0]:  jason stanley，
[Speaker 0]:  the ceo of barkle's bank faced very serious accusations。
[Speaker 0]:  he was implicated in the prosecutors records of proancion's testisations，
[Speaker 0]:  and then there's katra cardia cap who was also forced to resign due to the impact of this incident。
[Speaker 0]:  you can see that this incident actually exposed something the behind the scenes maneeuvering by upstein and dirtuwitz the kind of things that aren't visible on the surface，
[Speaker 0]:  they systematically targeted these people。
[Speaker 0]:  so in american academia，
[Speaker 0]:  if you criticize israel，
[Speaker 0]:  you face very serious consequences。
[Speaker 0]:  but after this wave of documents was released，
[Speaker 0]:  this scholar finklesteam saw his reputation sore。
[Speaker 0]:  everyone said that only this one person's image became more positive。
[Speaker 0]:  he's the conscience of the israelis，
[Speaker 2]:  the conscience of the entire jewish people。
[Speaker 2]:  that's the feeling。
[Speaker 2]:  then you said，
[Speaker 0]:  okay。
[Speaker 0]:  i also want to talk about this because we'll discuss it a bit later。
[Speaker 0]:  look at the chinese people regarding the large scale massacres committed during japan's invasion of china，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  but we haven't used this as an excuse to prevent others from criticizing us。
[Speaker 0]:  we really haven't israel's use of this approach and its success might be related to the rather aggressive nature of their national character。
[Speaker 0]:  that's all i can say next is the connection with iran and steve banan's。
[Speaker 0]:  european network，
[Speaker 0]:  you know that iran and israel have an a reconcilable hatred for each other，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  both sides want to destroy the other，
[Speaker 0]:  especially the former iranian president ahmad njdd didn't make very shocking anti summdic remarks at the time，
[Speaker 0]:  then the lead e mail that that pstein and omedindinjob met during the latterters time as the iranian ambassador to the UN in new york and describe abstein is possessing multi facity and perverse political and social skills，
[Speaker 0]:  able to establish connections with figures like castro and ahddina jod。
[Speaker 0]:  you can see that esteine's abilities were indeed quite strong。
[Speaker 0]:  he was able to transsend ideologies build such a gloloal network of influence。
[Speaker 0]:  that's very impressive。
[Speaker 0]:  indeed，
[Speaker 0]:  of course，
[Speaker 0]:  the former israeli prime minister or former president came out to deny it，
[Speaker 0]:  saying that he had nothing to do with abstein，
[Speaker 0]:  otherwise the conservatives in their country would attack him saying，
[Speaker 0]:  are you colluding with isreal？
[Speaker 0]:  how do you still have connections with abstein？
[Speaker 0]:  where do you still ned this spy？
[Speaker 0]:  quote，
[Speaker 0]:  they would suspect him of being compromised by an iranian agent，
[Speaker 0]:  then we come to a very crucial figure robert maxwell。
[Speaker 0]:  we mentioned this person in a previous live stream。
[Speaker 0]:  he's the father of absteen's girlfriend maxwell。
[Speaker 0]:  this guy has basically been confirmed to be in israeli spy。
[Speaker 2]:  this is further corroaborated in the emails exposed by estein，
[Speaker 2]:  because epsteen's emails mentioned robert maxwell，
[Speaker 2]:  it actually quotes an article that says，
[Speaker 2]:  robert max。
[Speaker 2]:  well，
[Speaker 2]:  ffridand mose said saying that if they didn't provide four hundred million pounds，
[Speaker 2]:  he would expose all their intelligence activities。
[Speaker 2]:  subsequently，
[Speaker 2]:  he died in this email abstince specifically use the passive voice was passed away。
[Speaker 2]:  this means that his passing away wasn't a natural state，
[Speaker 2]:  but a passive one he was made to die for those familiar with english grammar。
[Speaker 0]:  you know that this actually implies that the death was not accidental，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  this is a very uncommon，
[Speaker 0]:  unusual kind of english grammar，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  it's similar to how about ten or fifteen years ago in china，
[Speaker 0]:  there were often strange incidents like being suicided，
[Speaker 0]:  right，
[Speaker 0]:  quote，
[Speaker 0]:  being harmonized。
[Speaker 0]:  and so on。
[Speaker 0]:  these strange uses of chinese often have political implications。
[Speaker 0]:  so these intelligence analysis experts generally believe that robert maxwell，
[Speaker 0]:  while austsibly a media mogol was actually an important asset of of mosad。
[Speaker 0]:  furthermore，
[Speaker 0]:  his death was highly suspicious。
[Speaker 0]:  he ultimately died after falling from his yacht into the sea，
[Speaker 0]:  his body floating on the service。
[Speaker 0]:  many believe he was murdered for black milling intelligence agencies。
[Speaker 0]:  you can see that apple himself actually believe this conspiracy theory when he forwarded that email his statement about being forced to commit suicide hinted at this essentially reinforcing a widely circulated theory。
[Speaker 0]:  this ultimately involves a very powerful family。
[Speaker 0]:  and peter tell in the estiine documents。
[Speaker 0]:  you can see that tell is raning third or forth。
[Speaker 0]:  i think third，
[Speaker 0]:  he also had a close relationship with abstein，
[Speaker 0]:  and the too often met since peter teel is gay，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  he certainly wouldn't be very interested in women，
[Speaker 0]:  but whether he's interested in men is another question that's unknown。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  i think his main connection with abstein was probably centered around investment，
[Speaker 0]:  because you know，
[Speaker 0]:  teel mainly invested in palenteer。
[Speaker 0]:  palenteer actually has deep roots in israel，
[Speaker 0]:  including the former israeli prime minister barack，
[Speaker 0]:  who also has connections to palunteer。
[Speaker 0]:  after this email was exposed，
[Speaker 0]:  it showed that abstein once represented the roth's child family。
[Speaker 0]:  you know，
[Speaker 0]:  this family，
[Speaker 0]:  right。
[Speaker 0]:  there are the core of many conspiracy theories，
[Speaker 0]:  a very important figure in conspiracy theories。
[Speaker 0]:  this family is described by many conspiracy theories as secretly controlling the entire global financial network。
[Speaker 0]:  but coincidentally，
[Speaker 0]:  this family actually appeared in empsten's emails，
[Speaker 0]:  and he even represented this family to contact peter tiel，
[Speaker 0]:  saying that he had one hundred sixty billion assets and could facility the integration of finance and technology with tial teal，
[Speaker 2]:  refuse the trip to the middle east，
[Speaker 2]:  but said they could meet in new york or on epsteee's island。
[Speaker 0]:  um wow，
[Speaker 0]:  isn't this rod's child，
[Speaker 0]:  the same one that professor song hunting talked about regarding currency，
[Speaker 0]:  many people said he was unreliable，
[Speaker 2]:  calling it a conspiracy theory，
[Speaker 2]:  but it was indeed mention here。
[Speaker 2]:  however，
[Speaker 2]:  mentioning it doesn't necessarily mean there's a conspiracy。
[Speaker 2]:  it's just that they use this name to find APT forum。
[Speaker 2]:  yes。
[Speaker 0]:  so song hunting also said that rod's child doesn't actually control trillions of dollars，
[Speaker 0]:  but look at his assets，
[Speaker 0]:  one thousand，
[Speaker 0]:  six hundred billion。
[Speaker 0]:  of course，
[Speaker 0]:  i don't dare say now that the conspiracy theies definitely wrong because it might be like the ipack in israel，
[Speaker 0]:  a bell weather，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  you invest in this first than the other tens of trillions follow suit。
[Speaker 0]:  it's really hard to say。
[Speaker 0]:  so now facing this，
[Speaker 0]:  i can only say，
[Speaker 0]:  oh，
[Speaker 0]:  my god，
[Speaker 0]:  roth's child that roth's child，
[Speaker 0]:  right，
[Speaker 0]:  yes。
[Speaker 0]:  at the same time，
[Speaker 0]:  the party also has a section about broke，
[Speaker 0]:  and larry summers。
[Speaker 0]:  every everyone knows larry summers，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  he was forced to resign from his current position because of the stanford documents league。
[Speaker 0]:  he was the former treasury secretary under obama or an economist。
[Speaker 0]:  i forget his exact position。
[Speaker 0]:  he also had a relationship with a beautiful female chinese economist this LAS，
[Speaker 0]:  and they had a three point five hour recorded conversation in it。
[Speaker 0]:  they discuss barkk joining palunteer，
[Speaker 0]:  the intelligence and defence technology company invested in by peter tiel。
[Speaker 0]:  this helped the israeli cybersecurity company expand its global market。
[Speaker 0]:  so you can imagine the deep relationship between plentier the trumpadministration and US department of defences intelligence network and the israeli intelligence organization。
[Speaker 0]:  finally，
[Speaker 0]:  they're stebbanon the former chief strategists for she and also trumps former chief strategist。
[Speaker 0]:  their relationship with abstein is extremely deep。
[Speaker 0]:  i saw a video on warmzon on the channel that was specifically an interview with estein before his death。
[Speaker 0]:  bon was interviewing him at the time，
[Speaker 0]:  and bandon actually took money from him to fill a series of videos to help abstein reshape his media image somewhat similar to absteene's initial goal。
[Speaker 1]:  in doing this public relations work in the emails you saw concerning his connection with apple。
[Speaker 0]:  many things were mentioned，
[Speaker 0]:  including the hope that apple would fund european populism。
[Speaker 0]:  moreover，
[Speaker 0]:  he also wanted to help infiltrate anti establishment movements。
[Speaker 0]:  it's very ironic because many of his friends are actually from the establishment，
[Speaker 0]:  the ruling elite。
[Speaker 0]:  but at the same time，
[Speaker 0]:  he also transcds ds political facfactions。
[Speaker 0]:  he connects with the establishment，
[Speaker 0]:  and he also connects with the antiestablishment。
[Speaker 0]:  he has very deep connections with shiferand bbanon。
[Speaker 0]:  so you see that the abstein case reveals a systematic network of moral corruption。
[Speaker 0]:  he wasn't a one individual。
[Speaker 0]:  he was actually a note that the entire western power core testdly condoned or even exploited。
[Speaker 0]:  i don't know if you're seen movie。
[Speaker 0]:  e ord of war，
[Speaker 0]:  starting nicholas cage。
[Speaker 0]:  i've heard of it，
[Speaker 0]:  but i haven't seen it。
[Speaker 0]:  the protaagonist in that movie is involved in arms dealing，
[Speaker 0]:  which i think is somewhat similar to absteine。
[Speaker 0]:  he operated a network of arms trafficking，
[Speaker 0]:  but after he was arrested，
[Speaker 0]:  the government officials would find a reason to let him go。
[Speaker 0]:  the most classic scene is at the end when he's called by a very rightest police officer，
[Speaker 0]:  an interpol agent who is investigating arms trafficking。
[Speaker 0]:  he's locked up in a prison and being interrogated。
[Speaker 0]:  he says everything you're saying is correct。
[Speaker 0]:  and i don't have any problem with you，
[Speaker 0]:  but in about half an hour，
[Speaker 0]:  your superior will come and let me out，
[Speaker 0]:  because my boss is also your boss，
[Speaker 0]:  and your boss 's boss，
[Speaker 0]:  and your boss 's boss，
[Speaker 0]:  ses boss，
[Speaker 0]:  meaning the us。
[Speaker 0]:  president，
[Speaker 0]:  these high ranking people in popower。
[Speaker 0]:  they find it inconvenient to handle certain things themselves。
[Speaker 0]:  so they delegate the work to me。
[Speaker 0]:  this time，
[Speaker 0]:  i was arrested。
[Speaker 0]:  they might even pay me in the end，
[Speaker 0]:  everything he said，
[Speaker 0]:  came true。
[Speaker 0]:  his superior came first，
[Speaker 0]:  encouraging the agent，
[Speaker 0]:  saying you did a good job。
[Speaker 0]:  catching this person on this project was excellent。
[Speaker 0]:  okay，
[Speaker 0]:  you can go now，
[Speaker 0]:  quote，
[Speaker 0]:  then they released him and even gave him a suitcase full of money before letting him go。
[Speaker 0]:  um you've observed very well，
[Speaker 0]:  don't do that again next time。
[Speaker 0]:  this is a no tasably approved or even utitized by the core power network。
[Speaker 0]:  it's just a tool。
[Speaker 0]:  the currency of the entire power structure and charity is a tool。
[Speaker 0]:  white washing。
[Speaker 0]:  you see epsteine tried to create a philanthropic image for himself。
[Speaker 0]:  he donated money to MIT and harvard，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  he donated money to various charitable organizations。
[Speaker 0]:  but in fact，
[Speaker 0]:  all of his money came from dirty sources。
[Speaker 0]:  actually，
[Speaker 0]:  sex also plays a role here，
[Speaker 0]:  which is to construct a network of shared criminality where everyone is equally tainted in this way，
[Speaker 0]:  nobody can accuse anyone else。
[Speaker 0]:  and finally，
[Speaker 0]:  the news is that members of congress will have the opportunity next week to see the documents without any reductions or blked out sections，
[Speaker 0]:  then we will be able to see more information。
