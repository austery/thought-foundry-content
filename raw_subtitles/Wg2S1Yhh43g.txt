over
 the
 past
 week.
 Massive
 protests


have
 erupted
 across
 Iran,


>> calling
 for
 economic
 reform
 and
 an
 end


to
 the
 regime.


In
 recent
 days,
 a
 full
 picture
 of
 the


government's
 crackdown
 on
 the
 protesters


has
 emerged,
 garnering
 worldwide


condemnation.


>> We
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 what's
 happening
 in


Iran
 happen.


>> And
 threats
 of
 action
 from
 [music]


President
 Trump.


>> One
 thing,
 when
 they
 start
 killing


thousands
 of
 people
 and
 now
 you're


telling
 me
 about
 hanging,
 we'll
 see
 how


that
 works
 out
 for
 them.
 It's
 not
 going


to
 work
 out
 good.


>> From
 the
 [music]
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm


Rachel
 Abrams
 and
 this
 is
 the
 Daily.


Today,
 [music]


my
 colleague
 Farnaz
 Fihi
 on
 what's


driving
 the
 protesters
 [music]
 and
 why


the
 Iranian
 regime
 has
 never
 been
 closer


to
 collapse.


[music]


It's
 Wednesday,
 January
 14th.


Fern,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 joining
 us.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.
 Fernas,
 you


have
 been
 covering
 Iran
 for
 decades
 and


we
 at
 the
 Daily
 turn
 to
 you
 during
 these


huge
 moments
 of
 disruptions,
 eruptions,


which
 is
 what
 it
 feels
 like
 we
 are
 in


right
 now
 in
 Iran.
 We're
 talking
 to
 you


Tuesday
 afternoon
 at
 about
 1:30
 p.m.
 And


I'd
 like
 for
 you
 to
 start
 off
 by


characterizing
 what
 we
 are
 seeing
 on
 the


ground
 right
 now.


For
 the
 past
 week,
 we've
 seen
 nationwide


protests
 in
 cities
 big
 and
 small,
 across


different
 demographics
 erupt
 all
 across


Iran
 with
 a
 singular
 demand
 for
 the
 end


of
 the
 Islamic
 Republic's
 rule.


And
 this
 is
 coupled
 with
 an
 external


threat
 from
 the
 United
 States
 and


Israel.


>> Uh
 that
 there
 might
 be
 a
 military
 strike


on
 Iran
 and
 an
 economy
 that's
 in
 tail


spin
 which
 is
 creating
 a
 very
 unique
 and


difficult
 challenge
 for
 the
 government


because
 it's
 facing
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 perfect


storm.
 But
 we're
 also
 seeing
 the


government
 brutally
 responding
 to
 these


protests
 and
 violent
 crackdown
 unfolding


with
 thousands
 of
 people
 killed
 and


injured
 and
 bodies
 are
 piling
 up
 at
 the


morg
 and
 at
 the
 cemetery
 as
 reports
 of


the
 killings
 trickle
 out.
 So
 as
 you
 said


it
 is
 a
 perfect
 storm
 of
 things
 that
 the


regime
 is
 dealing
 with
 in
 terms
 of


threats.
 So,
 I
 want
 to
 start
 with
 the


protests
 themselves
 and
 what's
 going
 on


inside
 the
 country.
 Can
 you
 just
 talk
 a


little
 bit
 about
 what's
 driving
 people


to
 the
 streets?


>> People
 are
 just
 fed
 up,
 Rachel.
 They


feel
 like
 they've
 got
 nothing
 to
 lose.


That
 this
 government
 is
 either
 unwilling


or
 incapable
 of
 bringing
 the
 kind
 of


change
 that
 people
 want
 to
 see
 in
 their


lives.
 ranging
 from
 social
 freedom
 to


political
 freedom
 and
 of
 course
 the


economy
 which
 is
 fueling
 these
 protests.


Now
 we
 have
 to
 remember
 that
 Iran's


economy
 has
 been
 in
 shambles
 for
 years.


President
 Trump
 reimposed
 sanctions
 on


Iran
 targeting
 its
 oil
 revenues
 and


international
 banking
 structures
 in
 2018


when
 he
 exited
 the
 nuclear
 deal
 between


Iran
 and
 world
 powers.


In
 the
 fall,
 the
 United
 Nations
 Security


Council
 re-imposed
 UN
 sanctions
 on
 Iran


through
 a
 mechanism
 known
 as
 snapback


related
 to
 Iran
 standoff
 with
 Europeans


in
 the
 United
 States
 over
 the
 nuclear


program.


And
 from
 then
 the
 currency
 started


falling
 even
 further
 than
 it
 had
 before.


But
 in
 December,
 [music]


on
 December
 28th,
 the
 real
 plunged
 to
 an


all-time
 low
 against
 the
 US
 dollar
 and


it
 sort
 of
 unleashed
 this
 wave
 of
 anger


because
 when
 the
 currency
 free
 falls,
 it


has
 a
 direct
 impact
 on
 inflation
 and
 on


the
 prices
 of
 everyday
 goods,
 including


food
 items.
 [music]


Inflation
 is
 now
 around
 60%.


Prices
 of
 everyday
 goods
 [music]
 such
 as


cooking
 oil,
 rice,
 eggs,
 like
 staples
 of


an
 Iranian
 grocery
 basket
 suddenly


tripled
 overnight.


So
 this
 wave
 of
 protest
 that
 we're


seeing
 now
 started
 in
 Thran's
 bazar,


[music]


which
 is
 really
 the
 pulse
 of
 Iran's


economy.
 The
 bazar
 is
 the
 equivalent
 of


the
 stock
 market
 here,
 right?
 So
 when


the
 bazaris
 go
 on
 strike
 it
 really
 can


paralyze
 the
 economy.
 And
 the
 reason
 the


bazaris
 went
 on
 strike
 was
 because
 the


real
 was
 plunging
 against
 the
 dollar.


The
 prices
 were
 fluctuating
 and
 they


were
 facing
 too
 much
 instability.


you
 know
 from
 hour
 to
 hour
 they
 had
 to


adjust
 the
 prices
 of
 what
 they
 had
 to


buy
 and
 what
 they
 had
 to
 procure
 and


what
 they
 had
 to
 sell
 because
 they


didn't
 know
 within
 a
 few
 hours
 what
 the


price
 of
 uh
 US
 dollar
 against
 the
 real


was
 going
 to
 be
 and
 there
 was
 this
 sense


that
 we
 want
 to
 put
 pressure
 on
 the


government
 and
 the
 central
 bank
 to
 try


to
 stabilize
 the
 currency
 because
 we


just
 can't
 operate
 this
 way
 [music]


and
 then
 it
 spread
 it
 first
 spread
 to


workingass
 areas
 to
 small
 towns
 that
 are


underdeveloped
 that
 are
 economically
 on


a
 lower
 level
 and
 it
 sort
 of
 percolated


that
 way
 for
 about
 a
 week.
 And
 how
 did


the
 government
 respond
 to
 all
 of
 this


growing
 unrest?


>> The
 government
 initially
 responded
 with


a
 more
 consolatory
 tone
 with
 the


president
 Masud
 Peshan
 saying,
 "You're


all
 my
 children.
 The
 protesters
 have
 a


legitimate
 reason
 to
 protest.
 we


understand
 and
 we
 feel
 bad.
 And
 then
 he


moved
 very
 quickly
 to
 take
 measures
 that


he
 thought
 would
 contain
 and
 appease


particularly
 the
 bazaar.
 He
 sacked
 the


governor
 of
 the
 central
 bank.
 He
 also


announced
 a
 new
 currency
 policy.
 And


then
 the
 government
 announced
 that
 it


was
 giving
 every
 Iranian
 a
 monthly


stipend
 of
 $7,


which
 because
 of
 the
 inflation,
 it
 could


only
 buy
 you
 a
 bottle
 of
 cooking
 oil.


But
 the
 measures
 that
 he
 was
 taking
 not


only
 did
 little
 to
 appease
 people,
 but


they
 also
 had
 an
 opposite
 effect.
 So,
 it


sort
 of
 reinforced
 this
 feeling
 that
 the


people
 who
 are
 in
 charge
 don't
 really


know
 what
 they're
 doing
 and
 things
 are


not
 going
 to
 get
 better.
 And
 that
 fueled


more
 anger
 that
 sparked
 more
 outrage
 and


you
 know
 momentum
 was
 sort
 of
 building


for
 people
 to
 come
 out
 in
 larger
 numbers


and
 say
 enough
 is
 enough.


>> So,
 we're
 talking
 about
 a
 crisis
 that
 is


largely
 sparked.
 it
 sounds
 like
 from


this
 spiraling
 economy.
 But
 I
 think
 that


a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 are
 listening
 to


this
 are
 going
 to
 remember
 another


protest
 just
 a
 few
 years
 ago
 that


started
 over
 women's
 rights.
 And
 there


was
 a
 question
 then
 too
 about
 whether


these
 protests
 whether
 this
 unrest
 would


actually
 topple
 the
 regime.
 Obviously


that
 did
 not
 happen.
 But
 can
 you
 talk
 a


little
 bit
 more
 about
 why
 more
 broadly


Iranians
 are
 unhappy
 with
 the
 government


that
 goes
 beyond
 the
 economic
 reasons


you've
 just
 laid
 out?


The
 Iranian
 society


is
 very
 different
 from
 the
 government


and
 clerics
 that
 rule
 it.


>> The
 majority
 of
 people
 are
 a
 lot
 less


religious
 than
 what
 the
 state
 wants
 and


what
 the
 state
 has
 has
 enforced.
 They


are
 not
 ideological.
 Sort
 of
 the


ideology
 of
 the
 Islamic
 Republic
 of
 the


1970s
 were
 anti-American.
 We're


anti-imperialist.


And
 that
 has
 faded
 in
 generation
 after


generation.
 And
 the
 younger
 generation,


as
 we've
 seen
 in
 videos
 coming
 out,
 in


protests
 of
 of
 the
 women
 led
 uprising


that
 you
 mentioned,
 want
 a
 different


kind
 of
 a
 life.
 They're
 super
 plugged
 in


on
 social
 media.
 They
 see
 how
 the
 rest


of
 the
 world
 is
 living,
 how
 their


counterparts
 in
 other
 countries,
 not


just
 in
 Europe
 and
 the
 US,
 but
 in


Turkey,
 in
 Dubai,
 in
 you
 know,
 other


Muslim
 countries,
 they
 have
 social


freedom.
 They
 have
 economic
 prosperity.


And
 they're
 saying,
 why
 not
 us?
 Iran's
 a


very
 resourcerich
 country.
 It
 has
 oil


resources,
 energy
 resources.
 And
 what
 I


hear
 from
 many
 Iranians
 is
 that
 this
 is


not
 a
 government
 and
 a
 system
 that
 we


deserve.
 M


>> we
 have
 to
 remember
 that
 over
 the
 past


two
 decades
 there
 have
 been
 waves
 of


pro-democracy


protests
 happening
 in
 Iran
 starting
 with


the
 student
 activist
 movement
 in
 1999


the
 green
 movement
 in
 2008
 the
 women
 led


protests
 an
 uprising
 in
 2022


all
 of
 them
 grassroots
 and
 mobilized
 and


organized
 by
 activists
 and
 leading


opposition
 figures
 inside
 the
 country


such
 as
 Iran's
 most
 prominent
 human


rights
 activist
 Narus
 Muhammadi
 who's
 a


Nobel
 Peace
 Prize
 laurate
 who's


currently
 in
 jail
 and
 many
 people
 look


up
 to
 her
 as
 a
 leader
 of
 this


pro-democracy
 movement.
 So,
 we
 see
 all


of
 these
 forces
 at
 play
 on
 the
 streets


across
 Iran.


In
 videos
 that
 we're
 seeing
 coming
 from


the
 protests
 that
 have
 gone
 viral,
 we


hear
 crowds
 chanting
 death
 to
 the


dictator,


death
 to
 the
 oppressor,
 whether
 be
 it


king
 or
 the
 supreme
 leader.
 Clerics
 get


lost.


>> [cheering]


>> We're
 also
 hearing
 crowds
 chant
 long


live
 the
 sha
 a
 reference
 to
 the
 last


monarch
 of
 Iran
 Mahasha


who
 was
 toppled
 in
 the
 1979
 revolution


in
 what
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 nostalgic
 call
 for


an
 era
 that
 Iranians
 remember
 pre
 the


revolution


and
 we're
 seeing
 young
 men
 and
 women


crowds
 forming
 in
 in
 different
 parts
 of


the
 capital
 in
 Tehran
 and
 other
 cities.


Fists
 in
 the
 air
 chanting,


freedom,
 freedom,


oadi.


So
 it
 sounds
 like
 this
 is
 really
 the


culmination
 of
 a
 deep
 disconnects


between
 the
 Iranian
 people
 and
 its


leadership
 which
 at
 least
 as
 you
 said


initially
 seemed
 sympathetic
 to
 the


movement
 and
 its
 concerns
 but
 clearly
 we


know
 that
 the
 situation
 has
 turned
 very


bloody
 and
 very
 hostile
 and
 violent
 and


I
 wonder
 when
 did
 that
 switch
 happen
 and


what
 have
 we
 seen
 in
 terms
 of
 the


violence
 that's
 gone
 on
 on
 the
 ground?


The
 change
 of
 rhetoric
 from
 the


government
 started
 when
 the
 supreme


leader
 Ayat
 delivered
 a
 public
 speech


[music]


>> labeling
 protesters
 as
 rioters
 and


saying
 they
 were
 the
 agents
 of
 the


United
 States
 and
 Israel.


and
 they
 were
 [music]
 destabilizing
 the


country,
 working
 for
 Iran's
 enemies.


[music]


Iran's
 [music]
 chief
 judiciary
 also
 said


that
 there
 would
 be
 no
 mercy
 for
 anyone


arrested
 and
 [music]
 justified
 the


crackdowns
 by
 pointing
 out
 to
 widespread


vandalism
 and
 burning
 of
 public


properties
 and
 cars
 and
 even
 [music]


attacks
 on
 mosques
 and
 police
 stations


that
 they
 had
 seen.


now
 now.


>> And
 then
 on
 Thursday
 when
 the
 crowds


swelled
 in
 the
 streets


[music]


>> and
 the
 cries
 for
 freedom
 grew
 louder,


please
 shut
 up.


>> The
 government
 unplugged
 the
 internet


and
 plunged
 the
 country
 into
 total


darkness.


They
 blocked
 incoming
 and
 outgoing


international
 calls,
 making
 it
 really


difficult
 for
 anyone
 outside
 to
 get


visibility
 about
 what
 was
 really
 going


on.
 Cell
 phone
 reception
 inside
 the


country
 has
 also
 been
 disrupted
 in
 what


seems
 to
 be
 an
 effort
 to
 try
 to
 stop


people
 from
 organizing
 and
 mobilizing


protests.


By
 Sunday,
 a
 picture
 was
 emerging
 that
 a


massacre
 was
 unfolding
 in
 Iran.
 I've


been
 able
 to
 communicate
 to
 protesters,


to
 doctors,
 nurses,


and
 people
 who
 have
 been
 on
 the
 ground


through
 satellite
 internet
 connection


that
 they
 may
 be
 able
 to
 find.
 Everyone


that
 I
 spoke
 to
 who's
 been
 out
 to


protest
 has
 seen
 someone
 get
 shot
 and


killed
 in
 front
 of
 him.
 M


>> two
 people
 told
 me
 that
 they
 saw
 snipers


in
 two
 different
 parts
 of
 the
 city


shooting
 down
 at
 the
 crowds.
 A
 friend


who
 was
 in
 central
 Tehran
 described
 a


horrific
 scene
 of
 security
 forces


gunning
 down
 young
 people,
 a
 young
 crowd


of
 men
 and
 women
 with
 machine
 guns
 and


people
 falling
 on
 top
 of
 each
 other.


Nurses
 and
 doctors
 that
 I've
 been
 able


to
 connect
 with
 described
 absolutely


horrific
 scenes
 unfolding
 at
 hospitals.


People
 shot
 at
 close
 range
 in
 the
 head,


in
 the
 torso,
 from
 the
 back.


>> One
 video
 that
 went
 viral
 was
 of
 a


Iranian
 wildlife
 photographer.


His
 face
 is
 bloody.
 Blood
 dripping
 from


his
 face.
 And
 he's
 addressing
 the
 camera


saying


>> to
 the
 security
 forces,
 "How
 can
 you


fire
 your
 own
 countrymen?
 Killing
 a


person
 is
 like
 a
 game
 for
 them.
 I
 swear


to
 God,
 we're
 also
 citizens
 of
 this


country.
 We
 have
 pain."


Videos
 we're
 seeing
 from
 Terron's
 morg


show
 bodies
 in
 bags
 piled
 in
 the
 parking


lot
 and
 on
 the
 ground


>> and
 families
 wailing
 and
 screaming
 as


they're
 going
 through
 them
 trying
 to


identify
 [music]
 their
 loved
 ones.


[crying]


This
 is
 a
 level
 of
 violence
 [music]
 and


cruelty
 that
 I
 haven't
 seen
 in
 the
 30


years
 that
 I've
 been
 covering
 Iran.


>> What
 you
 are
 describing,
 Fernas,
 is
 just


horrific
 and
 inconceivable
 I
 think
 to
 a


lot
 of
 people.
 Just
 these
 scenes
 of


absolute
 carnage
 all
 over
 Iran.
 And
 I


wonder
 whether
 the
 brutality
 of
 this


response
 is
 working
 for
 the
 regime
 in


terms
 of
 actually
 quelling
 the
 protests


or
 whether
 it
 perhaps
 is
 having
 an


opposite
 effect
 on
 people
 and
 what


they're
 willing
 to
 do
 in
 the
 face
 of
 all


of
 this
 opposition.


The
 situation
 is
 very
 fluid.


>> [music]


>> The
 protests
 have
 attracted


international
 attention,
 pressure
 on
 the


Iranian
 government,
 and
 of
 course
 the


unpredictable
 variable
 of
 whether
 the


United
 States
 is
 going
 to
 take
 military


action
 against
 Iran.


>> [music]


>> We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Fernas,
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 this


conversation,
 we
 talked
 about
 internal


forces
 on
 Iran
 and
 external
 forces
 on


Iran.
 So,
 I
 want
 to
 go
 external
 now.
 Can


you
 talk
 about
 what
 has
 happened
 outside


of
 Iran
 that
 has
 led
 to
 this
 moment
 and


had
 such
 an
 impact?
 Remember
 that
 Iran


has
 had
 a
 really
 tough
 year.
 In
 June,


Iran
 had
 a
 intense
 12-day
 war
 with


Israel
 when
 Israel
 launched
 surprise


attacks
 on
 Iran's
 military
 structure
 and


took
 out
 its
 military
 command
 chain
 and


nuclear
 scientists.


>> Iran
 was
 able
 to
 strike
 Israel
 with
 a


barrage
 of
 ballistic
 missiles.
 But
 that


war
 exposed
 Iran's
 weakness
 in
 terms
 of


being
 able
 to
 defend
 itself.
 And
 the
 war


of
 course
 culminated
 with
 the
 United


States
 getting
 involved
 and
 bombing
 and


severely
 damaging
 Iran's
 nuclear


facilities.


>> Another
 dynamic
 at
 play
 here
 is
 that


Iran's
 regional
 standing
 has
 changed.


its
 militant
 allies
 around
 the
 region


that
 it
 helps
 arm
 and
 fund
 like


Hezbollah
 in
 Lebanon
 and
 Hamas
 in
 Gaza


have
 been
 decimated
 and
 weakened
 by


Israel.
 Iran
 had
 counted
 on
 these


groups,
 particularly
 Hezbollah
 and
 and


Syria,
 the
 base
 that
 it
 had
 in
 Syria,
 as


a
 way
 to
 exert
 pressure
 and
 as
 sort
 of
 a


forward
 defense
 that
 it
 would
 say,
 well,


if
 you
 attack
 me,
 I
 can
 also
 fire
 and


create
 problems
 across
 the
 region.
 In


that
 sense,
 Iran
 has
 really
 been


weakened.
 How
 should
 we
 be
 accounting


for
 all
 of
 that?
 The
 embarrassment,
 the


evident
 vulnerability.
 Is
 that
 on
 the


minds
 of
 these
 protesters
 that
 we're


seeing
 out
 on
 the
 streets
 now?


>> Of
 course,
 I
 think
 that
 all
 of
 this


feeds
 into
 the
 momentum
 where
 it


emboldens
 people
 taking
 to
 the
 streets


thinking
 maybe
 this
 is
 the
 moment.
 We've


talked
 about
 how
 one
 big
 open
 question


right
 now
 is
 how
 the
 United
 States
 is


going
 to
 respond.
 And
 President
 Trump


has
 said
 on
 multiple
 occasions
 he's


willing
 to
 take
 action
 in
 defense
 of
 the


protesters.
 On
 Tuesday
 even
 he
 put
 a


post
 on
 Truth
 Social
 urging
 people
 to


continue
 protesting.
 He
 said
 that
 uh


they
 will
 pay
 a
 big
 price
 referring
 to


the
 regime.
 So,
 what
 do
 we
 know
 about


how
 [clears throat]


the
 regime
 is
 thinking
 about
 the


president
 and
 his
 threats?


>> Iran's
 leadership
 is
 taking
 the
 threats


and
 rhetoric
 coming
 from
 President
 Trump


very
 seriously.
 They
 of
 course
 have
 the


experience
 of
 the
 US
 bombing
 the
 nuclear


facilities,
 but
 also
 what
 happened
 in


Venezuela,
 right,
 really
 rattled
 them


because
 there
 was
 this
 sense
 that


President
 Trump
 is
 not
 bluffing
 and


he'll
 actually
 carry
 out
 what
 he
 says.


From
 my
 conversations
 with
 a
 few


government
 officials,
 we
 know
 that
 the


Iran's
 National
 Security
 Council


conducted
 an
 emergency
 meeting
 to
 talk


about
 how
 they
 would
 prepare.
 I
 know


that
 Iran's
 armed
 forces
 have
 been
 put


on
 the
 highest
 alert
 possible


anticipating
 an
 attack
 and
 the


government
 has
 said
 that
 if
 the
 US


attacks
 us,
 we
 are
 going
 to
 retaliate


forcefully
 against
 American
 targets
 and


ships
 and
 military
 bases
 in
 the
 region


and
 we
 will
 also
 attack
 Israel.
 So
 it


seems
 like
 they're
 preparing
 for
 war.


There's
 also
 some
 broader
 context
 that


we
 should
 not
 neglect
 here
 about
 the


relationship
 between
 President
 Trump
 and


Iran,
 which
 has
 for
 years
 been
 extremely


antagonistic.
 During
 the
 first
 Trump


administration,
 President
 Trump
 killed


Iran's
 top
 general
 that
 led
 to
 an


Iranian
 assassination
 plot
 against


President
 Trump.
 But
 I've
 also
 been


having
 a
 lot
 of
 conversations
 more


recently
 with
 colleagues
 in
 the
 newsroom


who
 cover
 the
 administration
 about
 how,


if
 at
 all,
 any
 of
 that
 that
 I've
 just


described
 plays
 into
 Trump's
 decision-m.


And
 they've
 told
 me
 a
 range
 of
 answers


that
 this
 could
 be
 about
 regime
 change


right
 now.
 It
 could
 also
 be
 about
 oil,


but
 it
 is
 also
 about
 power
 and
 how
 Trump


exerts
 it.
 So
 I
 wonder
 what
 you
 make
 of


all
 of
 this
 Fern
 just
 trying
 to
 put


together
 all
 of
 this
 context
 history
 and


the
 latest
 comments
 we've
 seen
 from
 the


president.
 What
 is
 your
 assessment
 about


sort
 of
 why
 the
 United
 States
 is


considering
 some
 of
 this
 action?
 Well,


we
 don't
 know
 for
 sure
 what
 President


Trump's
 motivations
 are.
 We
 don't
 even


know
 if
 he's
 going
 to
 go
 ahead
 and


topple
 the
 Iranian
 regime.
 He
 has
 said


previously
 that
 the
 US
 does
 not
 want
 to


engage
 in
 nation
 building
 and
 regime


change
 anymore.


But
 it's
 also
 possible
 that
 President


Trump
 sees
 some
 benefits
 to
 eliminating


the
 Iranian
 government's
 rule
 because
 it


would
 end
 nearly
 five
 decades
 of


animosity
 between
 Iran
 and
 the
 United


States.
 It
 would
 also
 remove
 a


government
 that
 has
 been
 hostile
 to
 not


just
 the
 United
 States,
 but
 also
 to


Israel.
 There's
 also
 a
 slight
 chance


that
 this
 could
 help
 realign
 the
 Middle


East
 in
 ways
 that
 could
 benefit
 and


secure
 American
 interests.
 And
 of


course,
 Iran
 is
 an
 oil
 rich
 country,
 so


there's
 also
 the
 energy
 factor
 there,


too.
 But
 we
 also
 know
 from
 history,


including
 recent
 history,
 that
 military


interventions
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 carries


enormous
 risks.
 I
 was
 a
 war


correspondent
 in
 the
 Middle
 East.
 I


covered
 the
 Afghanistan
 war
 in
 its


aftermath,
 Iraq,
 Syria,
 and
 we've
 seen


that
 the
 US
 can
 win
 the
 military
 war


because
 of
 its
 military
 might,
 but
 it


can't
 win
 the
 long
 war
 or
 the
 long


peace.
 That
 stability
 and
 a
 smooth


transition
 have
 been
 elusive
 in
 other


places
 where
 the
 US
 intervened,
 namely


Iraq.
 The
 United
 States
 own
 history
 with


Iran
 is
 also
 checkered.
 In
 1953,
 the


United
 States
 intervened
 and
 toppled
 a


democratically
 elected
 government
 of


Prime
 Minister
 Mosad
 and
 reinstalled
 the


sha
 through
 a
 CIA
 coup.
 And
 many


Iranians
 will
 tell
 you
 that
 that
 killed


the
 path
 that
 the
 country
 was
 on
 toward


becoming
 a
 democracy
 or
 a
 republic.
 And


within
 a
 few
 decades
 it
 exploded
 in
 an


Islamic
 revolution.
 And
 you
 know
 usually


regimes
 and
 governments
 are
 toppled


either
 by
 defections
 and
 coups
 inside
 or


by
 military
 interventions.
 We
 haven't


seen
 any
 major
 defections
 among
 the


military
 ranks
 of
 Iran's
 armed
 forces.


We
 haven't
 seen
 defections
 among
 the


political
 class.
 So
 right
 now
 there's
 no


sign
 that
 something's
 going
 to
 happen


from
 within.
 And
 for
 all
 the
 reasons


that
 we
 have
 discussed,
 a
 military


intervention
 to
 topple
 the
 government


could
 actually
 bring
 about
 years
 of


instability.


>> What
 might
 that
 instability
 look
 like


for
 Nause?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 for
 one
 thing,
 the
 fight


for
 what
 Iran's
 future
 might
 be,
 what


kind
 of
 a
 various
 opposition
 groups
 that


are
 very
 divided
 and
 don't
 have
 a


unified
 vision
 even
 currently.
 So,
 how


would
 that
 play
 out?
 There
 are
 ethnic


minorities
 in
 Iran
 that
 have
 aspirations


for
 separatism,
 for
 federalism.
 There


are
 also
 forces
 in
 the
 region,
 including


the
 Islamic
 State
 terrorists,
 including


militant
 Islamic
 forces
 that
 might,
 like


they
 did
 in
 Iraq,
 like
 they
 did
 in


Syria,
 might
 see
 a
 power
 vacuum
 in
 Iran


and
 pour
 into
 the
 country
 and
 use
 that


as
 a
 power
 base.
 M


>> and
 also
 we
 have
 to
 also
 remember
 that


the
 Iranian
 government
 does
 have
 a


support
 base
 of
 about
 at
 least
 like
 10%.


It
 does
 have
 armed
 revolutionary
 guards


and
 paramilitary
 force
 that
 are
 loyal
 to


it.
 So
 you
 could
 see
 also
 a
 scenario


where
 they
 would
 form
 armed
 insurgencies


and
 fight
 whatever
 is
 the
 next


government.


>> These
 are
 scenarios
 that
 are
 not


fantasies.
 And
 it's
 important
 to
 keep
 a


clearey
 and
 sober
 view
 of
 what
 the


options
 are
 and
 what
 the
 outcomes
 may


be.


>> Fernaz,
 you
 have
 seen
 and
 covered


decades
 worth
 of
 uprisings
 in
 Iran.
 And


I
 wonder
 what
 you
 think
 it
 would
 do
 to


the
 Iranian
 psyche
 and
 to
 the
 people
 who


are
 in
 the
 streets
 right
 now
 at
 such


great
 personal
 risk
 if
 ultimately


nothing
 really
 changes
 in
 Iran
 and
 the


status
 quo
 remains.
 The
 current
 uprising


in
 Iran
 has
 created
 a
 sliver
 of
 light


and
 hope
 for
 Iranians
 inside
 and
 for
 the


diaspora
 watching
 what's
 unfolding
 in


their
 country.
 And
 I
 think
 for
 people
 to


feel
 they're
 so
 close
 to
 change
 and
 to


freedom
 and
 for
 it
 to
 be
 crushed
 would


be
 devastating,
 would
 be
 heartbreaking.


But
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 would
 be
 the
 end
 of


the
 aspirations
 of
 the
 Iranian
 people.


[music]


I
 think
 no
 matter
 how
 much
 force
 the


government
 uses


and
 the
 level
 of
 crackdowns,


it
 can
 crush
 protests
 periodically,


but
 it
 can't
 kill
 the
 dream
 as
 it
 hasn't


been
 able
 to
 in
 previous
 protests.
 The


[music]
 protests
 have
 built
 upon
 each


other
 over
 the
 years.
 And
 what
 I
 hear


this
 time
 and
 what
 [music]
 I
 see
 is
 that


the
 Iranian
 people
 have
 lost
 their
 fear.


>> Fernaz,
 [music]
 thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.


We'll
 be
 right
 [music]
 back.


Here's


what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.


[music]
 On
 Tuesday,
 six
 federal


prosecutors
 in
 Minnesota
 resigned
 in


protest
 over
 the
 Justice
 Department's


push
 to
 investigate
 the
 widow
 of
 Renee


Good,
 [music]
 the
 protester
 killed
 by
 an


ICE
 agent
 last
 week.
 At
 least
 one
 of
 the


prosecutors,
 Joseph
 Thompson,
 [music]


reportedly
 also
 objected
 to
 the


department's
 refusal
 to
 investigate
 the


shooter.


Johnson
 and
 another
 prosecutor
 [music]


were
 leading
 the
 sprawling
 fraud


investigation
 that
 has
 royal
 the
 state


in
 recent
 weeks.


[music]


And


Bill
 and
 Hillary
 Clinton
 are
 refusing
 to


testify
 [music]
 in
 the
 congressional


investigation
 of
 Jeffrey
 Epstein,


escalating
 a
 month-slong
 battle
 with
 the


Republican
 representative
 James
 Comr


[music]
 of
 Kentucky,
 who
 chairs
 the


oversight
 committee
 and
 who
 said
 he


would
 hold
 the
 couple
 in
 contempt.
 The


strategy
 to
 push
 the
 Clintons
 to
 testify


[music]
 reflects
 Comr's
 overall


approach.
 Deflect
 focus
 from
 President


[music]
 Trump
 by
 redirecting
 it
 to


prominent
 Democrats
 who
 also
 associated


with
 the
 convicted
 sex
 offender
 and
 his


longtime
 [music]
 companion
 Gileain


Maxwell.
