[Music]


Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.
 We


are
 live.
 It
 is
 Monday,
 December
 1st,


the
 last
 month
 of
 the
 year,
 and
 I'm
 not


late,
 even
 though
 everyone's
 spamming.
 I


literally
 started
 five
 seconds
 before


8:45
 just
 so
 I
 could
 be
 on
 time.
 But


we're
 here.
 I
 have
 had
 the
 longest
 break


I've
 had
 from
 streaming,
 I
 think,
 in


like
 a
 year.
 To
 be
 honest,
 I
 have
 not


streamed
 for
 the
 past
 four
 days.
 And


it's
 kind
 of
 crazy
 because
 the
 last


stream
 I
 had
 was
 on
 Wednesday.
 Uh,
 no


Thursday
 stream,
 no
 Friday
 stream,
 no


Saturday
 stream,
 and
 no
 Sunday
 stream,


and
 now
 we're
 back.
 So,
 I'm
 happy
 to
 be


back.
 I
 hope
 everyone
 had
 a
 great


Thanksgiving.
 Quite
 frankly,
 I
 I
 enjoyed


the
 time
 off
 because
 like
 this
 is
 the


first
 time
 in
 I
 think
 about
 a
 year
 where


I've
 explicitly
 just
 spent
 time
 with
 the


family
 um
 for
 like
 four
 days
 in
 a
 row.


So,
 I
 I
 really
 hope
 people
 got
 to
 spend


some
 time
 with
 the
 family.
 obviously


missed
 everyone
 here,
 missed
 doing
 this


as
 well,
 but
 I
 I
 think
 sometimes
 you


kind
 of
 just
 need
 to
 step
 back
 from
 it,


especially
 given
 how
 emotional
 November


was
 up
 and
 down
 on,
 you
 know,
 everyone's


psyche,
 portfolios,
 obviously.
 Um,
 so
 I


think
 it
 was
 good
 to
 take
 a
 little
 bit


of
 break
 and
 I
 hope
 people
 got
 at
 least


some
 level
 of
 time
 away
 from
 the


markets,
 got
 to
 focus
 on
 football
 and


eating
 good
 food
 and
 talking
 with
 the


family.


Martin
 says,
 "And
 now
 you
 hate
 your


family."
 Well,
 that's
 usually
 what


happens
 after
 you
 spend
 four
 days
 with


your
 family.
 But
 no,
 I
 had
 a
 good
 time.


Went
 to
 New
 York.
 Um,


traveled
 a
 bit.
 I
 guess
 if
 you
 want
 to


say
 traveling
 to
 New
 York
 is
 a
 is
 a
 form


of
 traveling.
 Although
 New
 York
 was


dude,
 let
 me
 tell
 you,
 the
 consumer
 is


not
 weak
 in
 New
 York.
 Not
 in
 New
 York,


bro.
 The
 consumer
 is
 I
 have
 never
 seen


these
 many
 people
 at
 Brian
 Park.
 And


I've
 been
 to
 New
 York
 for
 Christmas
 many


times,
 but
 um
 it
 was
 pretty
 crowded.
 So,


no,
 we
 went
 to
 New
 York.
 just
 uh
 ate


some
 good
 food,
 spent
 time
 with
 the


family,
 really
 just
 enjoyed
 sitting
 down


and
 like
 not
 having
 anything
 to
 do.
 But


given
 the
 nature
 of
 I
 guess
 my


personality
 and
 so
 many
 of
 others


personalities
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 just


analyzing
 financial
 markets
 and
 wanting


to
 get
 on
 top
 of
 things,
 it's
 good
 to
 be


back.
 It's
 good
 to
 be
 back
 because
 it's


obviously
 very
 exciting
 to
 once
 again


analyze
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 global


financial
 markets
 and
 end
 out
 the
 year.


This
 is
 the
 last
 month
 where
 we're


finally
 going
 to
 be
 solidifying


solidifying
 these
 year-to-
 date
 returns.


And
 the
 question
 becomes
 over
 the
 next


31
 days,
 how
 do
 these
 returns
 end
 up


solidifying?
 How
 do
 these
 returns
 end
 up


turning
 out?
 S&P
 500
 right
 here
 down
 in


the
 pre-markets.
 Unfortunately,
 we
 are


starting
 off
 with
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 red
 day.


There's
 some
 reasons
 for
 why
 we're
 red.


It
 started
 last
 night
 with
 the
 futures.


We'll
 talk
 about
 why
 uh
 it's
 happening.


S&P
 right
 there
 down
 about
 69%.
 A
 lot
 of


it
 has
 to
 do
 with
 Bitcoin,
 but
 Bitcoin


is
 not
 the
 real
 story.
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


it
 has
 to
 do
 with
 Japan.
 So,
 we'll
 talk


about
 that.
 I
 have
 not
 focused
 on
 the


markets
 over
 the
 past
 three
 days
 until


last
 night
 when
 the
 futures
 opened.
 And


I
 was
 like,
 "All
 right,
 let's
 see
 what


the
 hell's
 been
 happening
 over
 the
 past


couple
 days."
 And
 quite
 frankly,
 not


much
 has
 happened
 except
 for
 Bitcoin


tanking
 from
 91
 to
 1.84
 this
 morning.


And
 as
 a
 riskon
 indicator,
 that
 kind
 of


took
 everything
 risk
 off
 as
 Bitcoin
 took


a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 dump
 right
 here.
 So,


we'll
 talk
 about
 what's
 going
 on.
 We'll


talk
 about
 Black
 Friday
 shopping
 sales.


again
 the
 consumer
 we
 saw
 in
 those


retail
 uh
 retailer
 ETFs
 or
 retailer
 uh


companies
 last
 week
 the
 XRT
 which
 is
 one


of the
 largest
 retailer
 ETFs
 was
 had
 it


had
 its
 best
 48
 hour
 stretch
 two-day


stretch
 since
 May
 uh
 Black
 Friday
 Cyber


Monday
 sales
 at least
 Black
 Friday
 and


Thanksgiving
 sales
 are
 in
 and
 it's


pretty
 damn
 good.
 I
 imagine
 Cyber
 Monday


is
 going
 to
 be
 pretty
 good
 as
 well
 based


on
 the
 analytics
 we
 have
 in
 terms
 of
 the


projections.
 If
 that's
 the
 case
 maybe


that
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 tailwind
 for
 the


market
 as
 earnings
 continue
 to
 get


better
 as
 the
 consumer
 maybe
 isn't
 as


weak
 for
 this
 holiday
 season.
 But
 you've


got
 Nvidia
 down
 1%,
 Pounder
 down
 1%,


Hoodie
 down
 3%,
 Amazon
 down
 a
 percent,


Broadcom
 down
 1.5,
 Tesla
 which
 Michael


Bur
 yesterday
 in
 his
 Substack
 said
 is


the
 uh
 is
 one
 of the
 most
 ridiculously


overvalued
 companies.
 So
 you
 got
 Bur
 who


has
 been
 taking
 shots
 at
 pounder
 and


Tesla
 Nvidia.
 Now
 he's
 taking
 shots
 at


Tesla.
 And
 so
 we'll
 discuss
 kind
 of


everything
 that's
 going
 on
 in
 the


broader
 equity
 markets.
 Again,
 S&P
 500


right
 there
 down
 about
 64%
 on
 the
 day.


Bitcoin
 85,800


falling
 from
 91,000.


Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 We


got
 a
 lot
 to
 get
 into.
 Again,
 very
 very


grateful
 for
 all
 of
 you.
 Hopefully
 you


had
 a
 great
 Thanksgiving.
 Got
 to
 spend


some
 time
 with
 your
 family.
 Uh
 I
 think


it
 was
 a
 much
 needed
 little
 bit
 of
 a


break
 after
 what
 happened
 in
 November.


But
 now
 we
 got
 to
 get
 back
 at
 it
 and


it's
 time
 to
 get
 into
 it.
 So
 let's
 get


started
 with
 what
 we've
 got
 going
 on.
 I


think
 we
 should
 start
 off
 with
 Japan.
 I


think
 we
 should
 start
 off
 with
 Japan
 to


give
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 analysis
 on


what's
 happening.
 Admit
 there's
 some


turkey
 in
 your
 beard.
 Dude,
 Thanksgiving


food
 was
 legit.
 I
 don't
 eat
 turkey,
 but


we
 had
 mac
 and
 cheese.
 We
 had
 ribs.
 We


had
 a
 We
 had
 ton
 of
 desserts,
 bro.
 Like


desserts.
 Desserts
 are
 what will
 kill


you
 from
 Thanksgiving.
 It's
 just
 like


that.
 That's
 what
 makes
 you
 just
 want
 to


go
 to
 sleep
 as
 soon
 as
 you
 eat
 those


desserts.
 But
 no,
 it
 was
 a
 pretty
 pretty


decent
 Thanksgiving
 here.
 Okay,
 so


Japan.
 Let's
 get
 into
 it.
 What
 happened


with
 Japan?
 Um,
 last
 night
 Japan's


10-year
 bond
 yield
 shot
 up
 and
 it
 shot


up
 aggressively
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 what


kind
 of
 caused
 Bitcoin
 to
 immediately


take
 a
 ugly
 dip.
 So,
 this
 is
 the
 overall


bond
 yields
 in
 Japan.
 You
 know,


ironically,
 I
 was
 listening
 to
 um
 I
 I


was
 listening
 to


a
 a
 a
 story
 or
 not
 a
 story,
 it
 was
 a


YouTube
 video
 that
 was
 talking
 about


Japan's
 collapse
 in
 the
 1990s,
 kind
 of


that
 lost
 decade
 for
 Japan.
 and
 and
 and


this
 was
 like
 a
 couple
 hours
 before
 the


futures
 open.
 And
 then
 these
 are
 all
 the


bond
 yields.
 Bond
 yields
 going
 up
 is
 not


a
 good
 thing
 because
 that
 means
 people


are
 selling
 bonds
 which
 means
 the
 yields


are
 going
 higher.
 So
 the
 market's


basically
 saying,
 "Hey,
 we
 don't
 trust


the
 rate
 of
 inflation.
 We
 don't
 trust


the
 fiscal
 or
 monetary
 policy
 that
 the


government
 is
 deploying."
 And
 as
 a


result,
 you
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 wacky
 things


that
 could
 happen.
 Now,
 why
 was
 this
 so


bad?
 Well,
 if
 you
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this


chart
 right
 here,
 1.838%


on
 the
 Japanese
 10-year
 bond
 yield.
 That


is
 the
 highest


um
 yield
 for
 a
 Japanese
 10-year
 bond


since


2008.
 And
 that's
 what
 I
 also
 think
 is


scaring
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 here
 because
 and


the
 reason
 this
 is
 happening
 by
 the
 way


is
 because
 Japan
 has
 been
 simultaneously


raising
 rates
 while
 they've
 also
 been
 uh


printing
 money
 which
 doesn't
 make
 a
 lot


of
 sense
 because
 you
 can't
 and
 and
 and


this
 is
 kind
 of the
 video
 that
 I
 was


watching
 and
 and
 I'm
 trying
 to
 do
 more


research
 on
 like
 the
 history
 of
 Japan
 so


I'll
 talk
 more
 about
 it
 over
 the
 coming


days
 but
 it's
 like
 Japan
 has
 had
 some
 of


the
 weirdest
 economic
 experiments
 in
 in


in
 human
 history
 and
 it's
 just
 stuff


that
 makes
 you
 scratch
 your
 head
 like


why
 did
 they
 do
 this
 in
 199
 1990.
 Why


did
 they
 do
 this
 in
 2000?
 At
 one
 point,


non-performing
 loans,
 NPLs,
 so
 loans


that
 are
 basically
 defunct
 loans,
 like


they're
 insolvent.
 You've
 got
 to
 write


them
 off
 and
 and
 you
 got
 to
 realize
 that


you're
 just
 never
 going
 to
 get
 the
 money


paid
 because
 your
 credit
 underwriting


was
 probably
 bad.
 At
 one
 point,


non-performing
 loans
 were
 10%


of
 Japan's
 GDP.
 This
 is
 back
 in
 2000.


Why?
 because
 the
 Japanese
 government


encouraged
 Japanese
 banks
 to
 prop
 up


these
 failing
 companies
 that
 had
 been


given
 loans
 that
 they
 were
 never
 going


to
 pay
 back
 and
 they
 only
 intervened


when
 [ __ ]
 really
 hit
 the
 fan
 going
 into


the
 end
 of
 2008.
 So
 I
 mean
 it's
 quite


incredible
 what
 has
 happened
 in
 Japan


and
 now
 what
 they're
 doing
 the
 tenure
 by


the
 way
 spiking
 as
 well
 doesn't
 make
 a


lot
 of
 sense
 either
 with
 all
 the


stimulus
 printing
 which
 I
 mean
 like
 you


could
 argue
 that
 that
 is
 important
 uh


for
 their
 GDP
 growth
 but
 also
 raising


rates
 at
 the
 same
 time
 is
 is
 a
 bit


confusing.
 So,
 you've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 weird


and
 wonky
 stuff
 happening
 in
 Japan,


which
 I
 think
 is
 what
 triggered
 the
 the


Bitcoin
 sell-off.
 Now,
 what's
 the


syllogism
 about
 the
 Bitcoin
 sell-off?
 If


Japan
 yields
 rise,
 the
 yen
 appreciates


against
 the
 dollar.
 When
 the
 yen


appreciates
 against
 the
 dollar,
 people


have
 to
 sell
 their
 uh
 yen
 or
 sell
 sorry,


sell
 their
 tech
 stocks
 or
 whatever
 other


asset
 they're
 in.
 Most
 of
 the
 types
 of


assets
 that
 immediately
 get
 sold
 off
 are


crypto
 assets
 because
 those
 are
 the
 most


liquid
 at
 that
 moment
 because
 they
 trade


24
 hours.
 that
 ends
 up
 being
 Bitcoin
 to


cover
 the
 short
 on
 their
 yen
 because


again
 there's
 a
 very
 convenient
 yen


carry
 trade
 that
 I
 think
 people
 know


about
 by
 now
 which
 is
 shorting
 the
 yen


borrowing
 in
 yen
 and
 then
 going
 long


tech
 or
 going
 long
 crypto
 or
 going
 long


something
 risky
 when
 the
 chickens


compose
 come
 home
 to
 roost
 for
 a
 trade


like
 that
 it
 ends
 up
 leading
 to
 a
 blood


bath
 in
 the
 US
 markets
 at
 least
 from
 a


risk-on
 perspective
 and
 so
 I
 think
 that


is
 what
 happened
 over
 the
 past
 24
 hours


you've
 also
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 reports
 of
 just


deleveraging
 so
 there's
 $800
 million
 ion


dollars
 of
 deleveraging
 that
 has


happened
 uh
 in
 the
 Bitcoin
 markets
 now


or
 in
 the
 crypto
 markets.
 No
 one
 knows


exactly
 why
 there's
 been
 so
 much
 of
 a


deleveraging
 effect.
 Again,
 one
 could


argue
 it
 is
 the
 yen
 carry
 trade,
 but


maybe
 it's
 something
 else.
 Maybe
 maybe


it's
 not
 just
 uh
 yen
 yen
 carry
 trade.


Maybe
 there's
 a
 different
 macro
 thesis


going
 on
 for
 why
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 take
 a


look
 at
 it
 XRP
 Salana
 Salana's
 at
 127


Bitcoin
 86,000
 Ethereum
 unfortunately
 is


not
 able
 to
 maintain
 any
 momentum
 above


3,000


800
 million
 as
 of
 this
 morning
 in


liquidations.
 You
 would
 think
 after
 all


the
 leverage
 that
 that
 happened
 on


October
 10th
 which
 led
 to
 that
 $20


billion
 liquidation
 and
 then
 again
 in


November
 that
 there
 wouldn't
 be
 as
 much


leverage
 in
 the
 system.


It
 looks
 like
 there
 is
 and
 it
 looks
 like


people
 continue
 to


to
 leverage
 up.
 So
 unfortunately
 this


might
 be
 another
 issue
 with
 what's
 going


on
 in
 crypto
 which
 is
 that
 there's
 just


a
 lot
 more
 leverage
 that
 is
 not
 wiped


out
 of
 the
 system
 yet.
 And
 I
 know
 that's


a
 terrible
 or
 that's
 an
 people
 don't


want
 to
 hear
 that
 because
 you
 know
 they


they've
 heard
 for
 the
 past
 month
 and
 a


half
 that
 there's
 leverage
 there's
 too


much
 margin
 but
 quite
 frankly
 there


might
 just
 be
 way
 too
 much
 freaking


margin
 in
 the
 system.
 And
 this
 brings
 up


the
 question
 of
 Sailor.
 Now,
 Sailor,
 I


don't
 know
 exactly
 what
 he
 announced


today.
 It
 still
 doesn't
 fully
 make
 sense


to
 me,
 but
 he
 announced
 a
 1.44
 billion


USD
 reserve,


which
 I
 guess
 that's
 just
 a
 reserve


filled
 with
 a
 billion
 dollars.
 And
 then


they
 bought
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 Bitcoin.
 I


didn't
 get
 time
 to
 fully
 analyze
 what


exactly
 happened
 today,
 but
 they
 bought


another
 130
 Bitcoin,
 89,
 960.
 They
 now


have
 650,000
 Bitcoin.
 By
 the
 way,
 they


updated
 in
 their
 8K
 their
 projections


for
 Bitcoin.
 They
 don't
 think
 it's
 going


to
 150,000
 anymore
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.
 They're
 now
 assuming
 85,000.
 So,
 a


lot
 of
 their
 projections
 came
 down,
 but


uh
 Sailor
 continues
 to
 buy
 and
 you
 got
 a


lot
 of
 people
 asking
 a
 question,
 wait
 a


second,
 could
 Micro
 Strategy
 become
 one


of the
 most
 distressed
 assets
 on
 the


planet
 in
 terms
 of
 debt
 just
 given
 the


amount
 of
 obligations
 they
 have?
 They


have
 about,
 if
 I'm
 not
 wrong,
 $730


million
 per
 year
 in
 interest
 that
 they


have
 to
 pay
 on
 all
 their
 preferred
 and


all
 the
 other
 types
 of
 equities
 they
 put


out.
 Um,
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 works
 when


Bitcoin's
 going
 up.
 When
 Bitcoin
 is
 not


going
 up,
 that
 becomes
 an
 issue.
 Now


granted,
 if
 you
 listen
 to
 Sailor,
 his


perspective
 is
 they
 have
 tons
 and
 tons


of
 money
 or
 not
 tons
 of
 money,
 they
 have


tons
 of
 leverage
 to
 be
 able
 to
 pay
 off


their
 debt.
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 clauses,
 if


you
 actually
 read
 through
 the
 preferred


equities
 they
 put
 out,
 allow
 them
 to


issue
 more
 stock
 to
 be
 able
 to
 pay
 off


the
 creditors
 instead
 of
 having
 them


giving
 them
 cash
 and
 selling
 their


Bitcoin
 is
 kind
 of the
 last
 resort
 uh
 in


in
 a
 lot
 of
 their
 filings.
 That
 it
 is
 a


possibility,
 but
 you
 know,
 given


Sailor's
 commitment
 to
 Bitcoin,
 it
 feels


rather
 unlikely.
 So
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of


different
 narratives
 boiling
 up,
 but
 I


think
 that
 yen
 carry
 trade
 is
 kind
 of


the
 core
 reason
 why
 Bitcoin's
 getting


hit
 and
 as
 a
 result
 that
 took
 down


Nvidia
 down
 1.2%.
 We'll
 talk
 about


Nvidia.
 You
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 different


things
 over
 the
 weekend
 about
 Nvidia,
 a


lot
 of
 new
 reports
 about
 what's
 going
 on


with
 Nvidia
 from
 a
 competitive


perspective.
 So
 we'll
 talk
 about
 that.


But
 obviously
 Google,
 Nvidia,
 Broadcom


Pounder
 Hood,
 Tesla,
 all
 of
 them
 getting


hit
 as
 Bitcoin


takes
 a
 uh
 takes
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 dip
 from


91,000
 to
 85,000
 here
 on
 the
 day.
 VIX
 is


up
 as
 well,
 up
 about
 I
 think
 what
 7%
 in


the
 pre-markets.


Yeah,
 around
 about
 7%.
 Okay,
 Tom
 Lee
 was


just
 on.
 Let's
 take
 a
 look
 at
 what
 he


had
 to
 say
 this
 morning
 as
 well
 and
 then


we
 will
 get
 into
 Nvidia


>> in
 the
 next
 couple
 of
 weeks
 is
 around


central
 bank.
 The
 Fed
 is
 set
 to
 cut
 uh


in
 December,
 but
 also
 today
 is
 the
 day


that
 quantitative
 tightening
 ends.
 And


as
 you
 know,
 the
 Fed's
 been
 shrinking


its
 balance
 sheet
 since
 April
 2022.


It's
 been
 a
 pretty
 big
 headwind
 for


market
 liquidity.
 The
 last
 time
 we
 had


an
 end
 to
 QT,
 quantitative
 tightening,


was
 September
 2019.


And
 if
 you
 look
 back
 at
 that
 period,
 the


markets
 really
 responded
 well.
 I
 think


within
 3
 weeks,
 rallied
 more
 than
 17%.


So
 I
 do
 think
 the
 timing
 of
 QT
 ending


which
 is
 now
 essentially
 QE
 starting


>> and
 the
 Fed
 and
 at
 a
 time
 when
 November


kind
 of
 was
 topsyturvy.
 So
 I
 think


people
 got
 cautious
 but
 now
 have
 to


performance
 chase
 and
 then
 you
 have
 a
 a


really
 typically
 a
 seasonal
 tailwind.
 So


I
 I'm
 pretty
 bullish
 into
 December
 even


with
 maybe
 the
 first
 day
 being
 rocky.


>> Yep.
 Um,
 so
 it's
 still
 all
 about
 the
 Fed


because
 I
 was
 thinking
 there
 there
 is
 a


time
 when
 a
 market
 can
 hit
 an
 inflection


point
 where
 the
 reason
 the
 Fed
 is


cutting
 um
 becomes
 a
 problem
 for
 the


markets.
 That's
 what
 I
 thought
 with
 the


jobs
 and
 everything
 else.
 it
 there
 might


>> uh
 I
 mean
 I'd
 say
 that
 the
 shutdown
 put


a
 blackout
 on
 data
 and
 I
 think
 that


created
 a
 bit
 of
 anxiety
 because
 you


know
 markets
 like
 visibility


but
 to
 me
 the
 fact
 that
 claims
 have
 been


behaving
 and
 that
 this
 the
 September


jobs
 report
 kind
 of
 showed
 a
 a
 bit
 of
 a


recovery.
 I
 think
 the
 labor
 market's


probably
 holding
 fine
 but
 the
 Fed


doesn't
 want
 that
 to
 worsen
 but
 I
 think


the
 inflation
 story
 is
 actually
 weakened


a
 lot.
 So
 to
 me
 the
 the
 Fed
 would
 be


cutting
 for
 the
 right
 reasons
 which
 is


as
 they
 look
 at
 the
 next
 12
 months
 the


tariff
 inflation
 impacts
 are
 fading
 but


there's
 risk
 on
 the
 job
 market.
 So
 I


mean
 I
 think
 it's
 cutting
 for
 the
 right


reason
 which
 is
 you
 know
 real
 rates
 are


tightening
 if
 they
 don't
 cut.
 Here


here's
 what
 concerned
 me
 about
 a
 couple


of
 weeks
 ago,
 Tom,
 with
 the
 market's


behavior,
 and
 that
 was
 watching
 all
 of


the
 AI
 high-f
 flyers
 dip
 and
 drop
 pretty


precipitously
 in
 some
 cases
 because
 it


looked
 like
 the
 Fed
 wasn't
 going
 to
 cut.


That
 raised
 questions
 about
 what
 was


happening
 in
 the
 private
 markets.
 And
 it


made
 me
 start
 to
 wonder,
 okay,
 are
 we


looking
 at
 a
 lot
 of
 business
 models
 that


don't
 work
 if
 the
 Fed
 doesn't
 continue


to
 cut
 rates?
 are
 are
 these
 and
 are


these
 the
 business
 models
 that
 are
 are


driving
 empowering
 the
 market
 right
 now?


That
 that
 that's
 the
 one
 thing
 that
 made


me
 sit
 up
 and
 say,
 "Huh,
 that's
 a
 little


different."


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 think
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 a
 bit
 of


soularching,
 Becky,
 in
 November
 because


we
 know
 leverage
 rose.
 Um
 and
 we
 know


there
 was
 deleveraging
 in
 in
 some


markets
 like
 crypto
 and
 we
 know
 margin


debts
 high.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 there
 was


essentially
 a
 reset
 in
 November
 because,


you
 know,
 the
 market
 had
 a
 6%
 decline,


but
 the
 AI
 stocks
 and
 the
 meme
 names
 and


a
 lot
 of
 other
 names
 fell
 even
 more.
 So


I
 I
 think
 that
 that
 position
 reset
 has


been
 healthy.
 And
 I
 think
 many
 fund


managers
 we
 talked
 to
 in
 November
 in
 the


midst
 of
 all
 that
 kind
 of
 threw
 in
 the


towel,
 thought
 the
 year,
 rest
 of
 the


year
 was
 sort
 of
 a
 write-off.
 And
 and


now
 if
 December
 is
 strong,
 there's
 going


to
 be
 a
 a
 bit
 of
 performance
 chasing.


And
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 you
 should


typically
 expect
 in
 the
 final
 weeks
 of


the
 year.
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 um


when
 we
 saw
 Bitcoin
 sell
 off
 and
 sort
 of


the
 the
 high-f
 flyier
 selloff
 on
 the


notion
 that
 Pal
 got
 hawkish
 at
 that
 one


whatever
 it
 was
 that
 one
 meeting
 and


then
 Williams
 totally
 turned
 that
 around


and
 and
 the
 Fed
 futures
 jumped
 and
 it


became
 clear
 they're
 definitely
 cutting


again
 and
 we
 got
 very
 little
 for
 that
 uh


with
 Bitcoin
 should
 be
 back
 at
 100
 if
 it


really
 is
 totally
 dependent
 on
 uh
 Fed


easing
 and
 and
 if
 if
 it's
 a
 debasement


trade,
 which
 people
 say
 it
 is,
 we
 didn't


get
 much
 for
 now.
 Everybody
 you're
 sure


that
 they're
 going
 to
 cut.
 Now,
 there


was
 a
 time
 where
 we
 thought
 they
 weren't


going
 to
 cut.
 What
 do
 we
 get
 for
 going


back
 to
 cutting
 mode?


Uh
 yeah,
 I
 mean
 uh
 Bitcoin
 and
 crypto


have
 been
 disappointing
 because
 they


really
 took
 it
 in
 the
 gut
 in
 midocctober


and
 then
 kind
 of
 got
 hit
 again
 when


you're
 right
 when
 the
 odds
 of
 a
 Fed
 cut


dropped
 um
 Bitcoin
 fell
 and
 then
 now


that
 the
 odds
 have
 recovered
 of
 a
 cut


they
 haven't
 quite
 recovered.


>> I
 mean
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 still
 the


lingering
 effects
 of
 that
 deleveraging


that
 happened
 on
 October
 10th.
 It's
 not


that
 different
 than
 the
 wipeout
 that


happened
 in
 2022
 with
 FTX
 that
 took


eight
 weeks.
 So,
 we're
 kind
 of
 emerging


from
 that.
 We're
 now
 that's
 seven
 weeks


in
 the
 rearview
 mirror.
 So,
 maybe
 in


another
 week
 or
 two,
 I
 think
 crypto
 has


fully
 washed
 out
 and
 that's
 when
 it


starts
 to
 participate.


>> Yeah,
 wipeout's
 a
 bad
 word.


If
 you
 could
 pick
 another
 one.


>> Apparently,
 Jensen
 is
 going
 to
 be
 on


CNBC
 at
 9:30
 just
 getting
 the
 headline


right
 there.
 So,
 probably
 it'll
 be
 five


minutes
 after.
 So,
 when
 the
 market


opens,
 we'll
 see
 what
 Jensen
 has
 to
 We


do
 have
 some
 updates
 on
 Nvidia
 um
 and


likely
 the
 deal
 that
 Nvidia
 announced


today
 is
 why
 Jensen
 will
 be
 live
 on
 on


today's
 show.
 But
 um
 you
 got
 Tom


basically
 making
 the
 argument
 right
 here


that
 we're
 going
 risk
 off
 on
 crypto.
 The


same
 sort
 of
 deleveraging
 argument
 he


made
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago.
 And
 unless
 that


changes
 then
 it
 does
 seem
 like
 crypto
 is


probably
 going
 to
 be
 stalled
 out
 for
 a


bit.


>> I
 think
 5%
 or
 maybe
 even
 10%'s
 possible


in
 December.
 So,
 I
 think
 a


>> 7200
 7,300
 is
 likely
 for
 S&P.


>> Ask
 you
 not
 to
 do
 that.
 You're
 giving
 me


a
 target
 and
 a
 time.
 Don't
 Don't
 It's


not
 good
 for
 your
 career.
 Don't
 do
 that.


You're
 going
 to
 be
 wrong
 one
 of
 these


time.
 But
 you
 don't
 care,
 do
 you?
 You've


been
 right
 enough.


>> Well,
 I'm
 just
 looking
 at
 probabilities,


but
 you're
 right.
 We
 We've
 been
 wrong


plenty
 times,
 Joe.
 So,
 I'm
 I'm
 okay


being
 wrong,
 too.


>> Okay.
 I
 never
 have
 been.
 Really?
 I
 don't


think
 so.
 That
 would
 be
 it.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 Tom's
 still
 calling
 for


7200o


um
 on
 the
 S&P
 500.
 Obviously,
 it
 does
 or


at least
 7,000,
 right?
 It's
 two
 and a


half%
 away.
 It's
 not
 that
 crazy.
 We


ended
 at
 683
 on
 uh
 Wednesday.
 I
 know


there
 was
 low
 volume,
 so
 now
 we're
 going


to
 have
 full
 volume
 come
 into
 the


markets
 as
 we
 approach
 the
 first
 trading


week
 of
 December,
 but
 it
 it's
 not
 crazy


to
 think
 we
 have
 a
 2
 and
 a
 half%
 month.


Now,
 there
 are
 some
 hurdles
 to
 get


there.
 One
 of
 the
 biggest
 hurdles
 over


the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 was
 clarity
 around


if
 we're
 going to
 get
 rate
 cuts.
 I
 mean,


probabilities
 are
 the
 highest
 they've


been
 even
 since
 all
 of
 last
 week
 when
 we


got
 the
 nod
 from
 Fed
 President
 Dally
 and


Fed
 President
 um
 Williams
 that
 we're


going
 to
 be
 likely
 to
 cut.
 I
 mean,
 87.6%


on
 the
 Fed
 futures
 probability.
 So,
 if


we're
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 get
 the


market
 expectation
 that
 a
 rate
 cut
 is


happening,
 I
 don't
 see
 that
 as
 bearish.


Does
 that
 mean
 we're
 going
 to
 pump?
 Not


necessarily.
 But
 it
 does
 mean
 there
 is
 a


chance
 we
 don't
 easily
 dump
 or
 the


bottom
 doesn't
 fall
 out
 like
 it
 was


happening
 in
 November.
 And
 you
 know,


November
 ended
 barely
 down.
 We
 peaked
 at


689.
 We
 ended
 Wednesday
 at
 683.
 I
 know


right
 now
 we're
 down
 about
 half
 a


percent.
 But
 as
 as
 crazy
 as
 Wednesday


was,
 it
 was
 not
 uh
 one
 of
 those
 months


where
 we
 actually
 ended,
 you
 know,
 four


or
 five%
 down.
 In
 fact,
 it
 was
 the


largest
 reversal
 in
 November's
 history


since
 1950
 on
 the
 S&P
 500.
 um
 we
 lost


four
 and
 a
 half
 percent
 and
 then
 we


recovered
 75%
 of
 that
 by
 regaining
 three


3.5%.
 So
 quite
 incredible
 how
 we
 ended


out
 November.
 The
 question
 is
 just
 will


that
 play
 out
 for
 December.
 Now
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 some
 people
 are
 skeptical


for
 December
 is
 because
 of
 Nvidia.
 So


let's
 get
 into
 that
 topic.
 Nvidia
 right


here
 174.99
 down
 about
 1.15%.
 It
 was


down
 1.8%
 on
 Wednesday.
 So
 actually
 on


Wednesday
 when
 the
 S&P
 closed
 uh
 not
 at


all-time
 highs
 but
 close
 to
 all-time


highs,
 Nvidia
 unfortunately
 was
 not
 able


to
 close
 higher.
 It
 was
 one
 of
 the
 only


stocks
 that
 was
 red
 on
 Wednesday,
 which


I
 thought
 was
 pretty
 peculiar.
 Like,
 why


is
 Nvidia
 red
 when
 the
 entire
 market
 is


pumping?
 I
 think
 it's
 healthy
 because


Nvidia
 going
 red,
 but
 the
 market
 pumping


means
 that
 there's
 other
 things
 that
 are


propping
 up
 the
 S&P
 500,
 which
 is
 good.


You
 had
 Google,
 Apple,
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 names,
 healthcare,
 that's


starting
 to
 play
 a
 role.
 But
 what's


happening
 with
 Nvidia?
 Well,


Semi
 analysis,
 which
 is
 a
 consulting


firm
 for
 semiconductors.
 A
 lot
 of
 people


probably
 know
 Dylan
 Patel.
 He
 is
 a
 uh


thought
 leader
 and
 he's
 the
 founder
 of


that
 boutique
 consulting
 firm.
 They
 put


out
 a
 report
 and
 that
 report
 I
 have
 not


fully
 read
 the
 report.
 It's
 like
 10,000


words.
 I
 did
 not
 do
 that
 over
 the


weekend.
 Uh
 I
 am
 planning
 to
 try
 to
 get


deeper
 into
 analyzing
 what
 they're


saying.
 But
 this
 graphic
 is
 what
 he


posted
 which
 summarizes
 the
 entire


report.
 And
 as
 you
 can
 see
 right
 here


from
 the
 graphic,
 it's
 basically
 Google


TPUs
 are
 coming
 for
 Nvidia's
 launch.
 Now


he
 is
 not
 saying
 Nvidia
 is
 dead.
 He's


not
 saying
 Nvidia
 is
 not
 going
 to


survive.
 He's
 actually
 incredibly


bullish
 on
 it.
 I
 think
 people
 are


painting
 his
 perspectives
 uh
 as
 a


semiconductor
 analyst
 in
 the
 wrong


light.
 I
 mean,
 he
 he
 he's
 by
 no
 means


bearish
 on
 Nvidia.
 And
 if
 you've


listened
 to
 any
 of
 his
 podcasts
 over
 the


past
 like
 six
 months,
 he's
 very
 very


bullish
 on
 their
 trajectory.
 Everyone


knows
 Nvidia
 is
 the
 leader
 here.
 But
 his


argument
 is
 there
 might
 be
 a
 little
 bit


of
 margin
 compression
 and
 there
 might
 be


a
 little
 bit
 of
 market
 share
 that
 is


being
 taken
 away.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 reasons


he
 points
 to
 that
 is
 because
 of
 the


early
 adoption
 that
 he's
 seeing
 in
 these


LLM
 companies
 with
 Google's
 TPU
 fleet.


So
 for
 example,
 he
 said
 OpenAI
 hasn't


even
 deployed
 TPUs
 yet
 and
 they've


already
 saved
 30%
 on
 their
 entire


labwide
 Nvidia
 fleet.
 This
 demonstrates


how
 the
 perf
 per
 TCO
 advantage
 of
 TPUs


is
 so
 strong
 that
 you
 already
 get
 the


gains
 from
 adopting
 TPUs
 before
 they


even
 turn
 on.


A
 TPU
 tensor
 tensor
 processing
 unit
 from


Google
 once
 again
 is
 another
 form
 of


ASIC.
 And
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 debates


online
 going
 on
 around
 the
 energy


efficiency
 of
 these
 TPUs
 and
 the
 ability


for
 them
 to
 be
 at
 least
 somewhat
 on
 par


with
 Blackwell
 if
 not
 quite
 frankly
 just


as
 good
 in
 a
 specific
 use
 case,
 maybe


not
 a
 general
 purpose
 use
 case,
 which
 is


where,
 you
 know,
 Jensen's
 kind
 of


retorts
 the
 ASIC
 argument
 comes
 in.
 And


as
 a
 result,
 it's
 a
 massive
 opportunity


for
 Google.
 You've
 already
 had
 a
 bunch


of
 investment
 firms
 like
 in
 like
 Morgan


Stanley,
 JP
 Morgan,
 Goldman
 Sachs.
 They


came
 out
 over
 the
 weekend.
 They
 said,


"Hey,
 we
 don't
 think
 Nvidia
 is
 going


anywhere."
 But
 if
 Google
 were
 to
 take


even
 three
 to
 4%
 of
 this
 market,
 we're


talking
 about
 massive
 upside
 to
 their


earnings
 and
 revenue
 potential
 over
 the


coming
 years,
 which
 is
 why
 I
 think


Google
 is
 holding
 this
 $300
 level
 that


it's
 staying
 at
 right
 now.
 So,
 look,
 I'm


trying
 to
 do
 more
 research
 on
 the
 TPUs.


I'm
 trying
 to
 understand
 them
 at
 at
 a


fundamental
 level,
 but
 at
 its
 core,
 I
 do


not
 think
 Nvidia
 is
 dead.
 I
 think
 Nvidia


is
 very
 attractive.
 If
 I
 bought
 more


Nvidia
 at
 170,
 if
 we
 go
 back
 below
 170,


I
 will
 be
 buying
 more.
 I
 think
 in
 a
 year


we
 will
 be
 laughing
 at
 the
 idea
 that


Nvidia
 was
 supposed
 to
 die
 because
 of


Michael
 Bur
 substack
 or
 because
 of


Google
 TPUs.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 if


you
 believe
 demand
 is
 insatiable
 for
 AI


and
 compute,
 you
 have
 to
 be
 bullish


Nvidia.
 It's
 just
 that
 simple.
 Because


if
 demand
 is
 not
 insatiable,
 even
 if


Google
 starts
 selling
 some
 TPUs,
 yeah,


they'll
 make
 some
 money,
 but
 the


sustainability
 of
 the
 earnings
 of
 that


business
 line
 of
 them
 like
 consistently


selling
 TPUs
 is
 not
 going
 to
 exist.
 Same


thing
 for
 AMD.
 Obviously,
 all
 the
 Core


Weaves,
 Neb,
 I
 ren
 those
 go
 out
 the


window.
 Like,
 you
 either
 believe
 the


demand
 is
 there
 or
 you
 don't.
 And
 if
 you


believe
 the
 demand
 is
 there,
 then
 the


company
 with
 the
 supply
 chain,
 with
 the


infrastructure,
 with
 the
 ecosystem,
 with


the
 ability
 to
 actually
 negotiate
 the


deals
 that
 allow
 them
 to
 have
 the


margins
 that
 they
 have
 is
 Nvidia.
 Not


saying
 th
 that
 that
 monopoly
 or
 that


pseudo
 monopoly
 is
 going
 to
 exist


forever.
 But
 I
 am
 saying
 given
 the
 level


of
 compute
 constraints
 we've
 seen
 and


energy
 constraints
 we've
 seen
 over
 the


past
 year
 and
 and
 based
 on
 just
 Jensen's


guidance
 for
 from
 uh
 Q3
 going
 into
 Q4


and
 now
 Nvidia
 is
 trading
 at
 a
 20
 times


EBID
 of
 value
 with
 a
 25
 times
 EPS
 for


2026.
 It
 just
 seems
 like
 a
 no-brainer
 in


my
 opinion.
 And
 you
 either
 believe
 that


or
 you
 don't.
 But
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 Nvidia


necessarily
 is
 now
 the
 lynch
 pin
 of
 the


market
 because
 the
 fact
 that
 the


market's
 kind
 of
 holding
 close
 to


all-time
 highs
 and
 Nvidia
 is
 down
 10%


from
 earnings
 is
 is
 relatively
 bullish


for
 the
 the
 broadening
 argument.
 But
 I


also
 don't
 think
 Nvidia
 is
 going


anywhere.
 And
 I
 think
 over
 the
 coming


months,
 maybe
 it's
 going to
 take
 a
 while


for
 us
 to,
 you
 know,
 crack
 200
 again.


But
 eventually
 money
 will
 find
 its
 way


into
 companies
 that
 are
 compounding


earnings
 and
 Nvidia
 for
 the
 foreseeable


future
 is
 not
 going
 to
 stop
 compounding


earnings.
 Now,
 if
 there's
 one
 quarter


where
 we
 get
 a
 sniff
 that
 Nvidia's


earnings
 growth
 is
 starting
 to
 fall
 off


a
 cliff
 and
 the
 analyst
 projections
 for


2027
 2028
 are
 dead
 wrong,
 Nvidia
 is


going
 to
 crash.
 But
 if
 that's
 not


happening,
 and
 you
 know,
 you
 got
 a
 lot


of
 analysts
 that
 are
 looking
 at
 these


numbers
 day
 in
 and
 day
 out,
 seeing
 that


the
 demand
 trajectory
 being
 there,
 and


then
 if
 you
 just
 trust
 Jensen,
 take
 his


word
 for
 it,
 whether
 you
 believe
 him
 or


not,
 if
 you
 believe
 him,
 you've
 got
 to


think
 the
 stock
 is
 deeply
 undervalued.


If
 you
 don't
 believe
 him,
 the
 stock's


overvalued.
 And
 obviously,
 Michael
 Bur


doesn't
 believe
 him,
 but
 you
 got
 a
 lot


of
 the
 world
 that
 does
 believe
 that
 in


Nvidia
 is
 going
 to
 win.
 So,
 I
 don't


think
 Nvidia
 is
 going
 anywhere.
 GCP
 is


still
 buying
 a
 ton
 of
 chips
 from
 Nvidia


for
 their
 cloud
 computing
 uh
 providers


or
 for
 their
 cloud
 computing
 clients.


GCP
 has
 to
 buy
 a
 lot of
 those
 NVIDIA


chips
 to
 be
 able
 to
 rent
 them
 out
 to
 a


lot
 of
 their
 clients.
 And
 so,
 I
 think


from
 that
 perspective,
 Nvidia
 is
 going


to
 be
 okay.
 Pounder
 right
 there,
 that's


down
 about
 1%.
 Broadcom
 did
 get
 an


upgrade
 today
 to
 450
 from
 JP
 Morgan.
 The


same
 argument
 being
 that,
 hey,
 we
 think


Google
 TPUs
 are
 a
 tailwind
 for
 Broadcom.


That
 stock
 though
 is
 down
 about
 1.6%.


Amazon
 almost
 breaking
 even
 in
 the


pre-markets
 right
 here.
 And
 they
 got


Bitcoin
 back
 at
 86,259.


Um,
 okay.
 So,
 let's
 get
 into
 a
 bunch
 of


other
 headlines
 we
 have
 because
 we
 have


a
 ton
 of
 other
 things
 that
 are
 happening


in
 the
 pre-markets.
 Yes,
 that
 is
 bullish


for
 AMCore
 as
 well.
 Uh,
 Broadcom
 and


Amcore
 have
 a
 very
 close
 relationship.


So,
 it's
 good
 that
 they
 are
 working


together
 and
 that
 Broadcom's
 getting


more
 of
 a
 light.
 By
 the
 way,
 last
 thing


on
 Nvidia,
 they
 did
 announce
 another


partnership
 right
 here.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know


enough
 about
 Synopsis,
 the
 company,
 a
 77


billion
 company.
 I
 really
 just
 haven't


looked
 into
 them,
 but
 they
 announced
 a


strategic
 partnership
 to
 revolutionize


engineering
 in
 denying
 NVIDIA
 and


synopsis.
 Multi-year
 collaboration


combines
 NVIDIA
 CUDA
 computing,
 agentic


physical
 and
 AI,
 and
 Omniverse
 digital


twins.
 The
 companies
 will
 also
 partner


on
 engineering
 and
 marketing
 efforts
 to


adopt
 GPU
 powered
 engineering
 solutions.


Synopsis
 up
 7%
 of
 the
 premarkets.
 Nvidia


is
 also
 investing
 $2
 billion
 in


Synopsis.


So,
 um,
 again,
 I
 I
 just
 I
 I
 don't
 know


enough
 about
 Synopsis.
 this
 deal
 is


going
 to
 make
 me
 actually
 learn
 more


about
 their
 business.
 But
 once
 again,


Nvidia
 has
 more
 cash
 than
 what
 to
 do


with
 it.
 The
 bears
 will
 say
 they're


investing
 two
 billion
 in
 Synopsis


because
 they
 want
 Synopsis
 to
 buy
 their


product.
 The
 bulls
 will
 say
 Nvidia
 has


to
 put
 the
 money
 somewhere.
 They're


putting
 it
 back
 into
 the
 ecosystem.
 And


so,
 as
 we
 as
 I
 learn
 more
 about


Synopsis,
 I'll
 have
 some
 more
 details
 on


what
 exactly
 that
 deal
 entails
 for


Nvidia.
 Uh,
 last
 actual
 thing
 on
 Nvidia


and
 Google
 before
 we
 get
 to
 some


headlines.
 You
 did
 have
 a
 uh
 a
 familiar


face
 do
 a
 new
 podcast
 over
 the
 weekend,


Mr.
 Elon
 Musk.
 here
 is
 what
 he
 said


about
 where
 he
 would
 put
 his
 money
 if
 he


was
 an
 investor.


>> I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 really
 I
 don't
 really,


you
 know,
 buy
 stocks,
 you
 know,
 so
 it's


not
 like
 uh
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 like
 an


investor
 in
 I
 don't
 like
 look
 for
 things


to
 invest
 in.
 I
 just
 try
 to
 build


things.
 Um
 and
 then
 there
 happens
 to
 be


stock
 of
 the
 company
 that
 I
 built.
 Um


but
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 about
 should


I
 invest
 in
 this
 company
 or
 I
 don't
 have


like
 a
 portfolio
 or
 anything.


Um


so


I
 I I
 guess
 um


AI
 and
 robotics
 are
 going
 to
 be
 very


important.
 Um


so
 I
 suppose
 it
 would
 be
 AI
 and
 robotics


that
 that
 you
 know
 aren't
 related
 to
 me.


Um,


I
 think,
 you
 know,
 Google
 is
 going
 to
 be


pretty
 valuable
 in
 the
 future.
 They


they've
 they've
 laid
 the
 groundwork
 for


an
 immense
 amount
 of
 uh
 value
 creation


from
 an
 AI
 standpoint.


Um,


Nvidia
 is
 obvious
 at
 this
 point.
 Um,
 I


mean,
 there's
 an
 argument
 that


companies
 that
 do
 AI
 and
 robotics
 and


maybe
 space
 flight
 are


going
 to
 be
 overwhelming
 overwhelmingly


the
 all
 the
 value
 almost
 all
 the
 value


>> Elon
 obviously
 takes
 some
 time
 as
 he's


uh
 answering
 questions
 so
 that
 is
 how


Elon
 tends
 to
 engage
 in
 interviews
 but


uh
 it
 was
 a
 decent
 interview
 I
 watched
 a


little
 bit
 of
 it
 last
 night
 and
 you
 got


Elon
 saying
 hey
 hard
 to
 imagine
 that


Google
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 a
 winner
 here


I
 think
 the
 sheer
 amount
 of
 evidence


Google
 has
 put
 out
 especially
 with


Gemini
 3
 has
 captured
 Elon's
 attention


pretty
 heavily
 and
 for
 you
 know
 Elon


competes
 with
 Google
 in
 a
 variety
 of


different
 ways
 for
 him
 to
 be
 able
 to
 be


like
 yeah
 these
 guys
 are
 setting
 up
 a


foundation
 to
 really
 win
 uh
 I
 think
 is


important
 and
 then
 you
 know
 he
 says


Nvidia
 is
 obvious
 so
 sundar
 Elon
 you
 had


that
 Google
 deep
 mind
 researcher
 on


Wednesday
 tweet
 that
 the
 Nvidia
 selloff


is
 stupid
 I
 I
 I
 do
 not
 think
 there
 is
 a


fundamental
 problem
 here
 with
 the
 Nvidia


thesis
 although
 it
 is
 a
 really
 exciting


story
 and
 that's
 one
 thing
 that
 I
 think


is
 very
 important
 for
 people
 to


understand
 as
 well
 um
 by
 the
 Amazon
 and


Google
 another
 partnership
 today
 in


cloud
 services.
 The
 initiative
 will


enable
 customers
 to
 establish
 private


high-speed
 links
 between
 the
 two


companies
 computing
 platforms
 in
 minutes


instead
 of
 weeks.
 So
 you
 got
 the
 biggest


hyperscalers
 continuing
 to
 collaborate


as
 per
 this
 announcement
 in
 the
 morning.


Uh
 it
 is
 a
 really
 exciting
 story
 for


Nvidia
 to
 be
 potentially
 dying
 and
 I


don't
 think
 Dylan
 Patel
 given
 the
 type


of
 integrity
 he
 has
 put
 out
 a
 a
 report


on
 Nvidia's
 moat
 being
 threatened
 by


Google
 TPUs
 purely
 for
 selling


newsletter
 subscriptions.
 But
 you
 got
 to


admit
 that
 it
 was
 going
 to
 sell
 a
 hell


of
 a
 lot
 of
 newsletter
 subscriptions,


which
 I
 think
 he
 charges
 like
 $500
 a


year
 if
 you've
 got
 people
 wondering
 if


they
 should
 sell
 their
 Nvidia
 because


Google
 TPUs
 are
 going
 to
 kill
 uh
 the


company's
 margins
 and
 MO
 etc.
 So
 like
 I


don't
 think
 he's
 doing
 it
 to
 like
 just


you
 know
 sell
 research
 but
 it
 is
 hard
 to


ignore
 the
 fact
 that
 that
 is
 a
 juicy


juicy
 story
 um
 across
 the
 entire
 media


landscape
 not
 just
 someone
 who's
 working


in
 semiconductor
 consulting
 research


that
 hey
 if
 Nvidia
 is
 done
 like
 people


want
 to
 know
 why
 and
 people
 want
 to
 see


the
 death
 of
 you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 largest


companies
 in
 the
 world
 and
 so
 I
 I
 think


from
 that
 perspective
 you're
 also
 just


going
 to
 get
 a
 ton
 of
 people
 that
 try
 to


find
 whatever
 bare
 case
 they
 hand.
 I


just
 try
 to
 keep
 it
 non-emotional.
 Look


to
 the
 numbers.
 Like
 I'm
 not
 even
 as


emotionally
 attached
 to
 Nvidia
 as
 I
 am


to
 pounder
 hood.
 Like
 obviously
 I've
 got


some
 emotional
 biases
 there.
 But
 but


when
 it
 comes
 to
 Nvidia,
 like
 it's
 I
 I


was
 I
 was
 pretty
 bearish
 Nvidia
 for
 the


past
 couple
 years
 until
 Deepseek
 and


that's
 when
 I
 took
 the
 opportunity.
 And


as
 I
 learned
 more
 about
 it
 and
 you
 look


at
 the
 multiples,
 this
 stock
 is
 cheap.


Like
 if
 you
 believe
 in
 their
 EPS
 growth,


it
 is
 trading
 at
 a
 relatively
 reasonable


multiple
 that's
 cheaper
 than
 a
 lot
 of


names
 in
 the
 market.
 The
 obvious
 one


that
 you
 guys
 have
 heard
 many
 times
 by


our
 good
 friend
 the
 milkman.
 Costco
 and


Walmart
 still
 trade
 at
 35
 times
 and
 50


times
 for
 Costco
 next
 year's
 earnings.


Nvidia
 trades
 at
 24
 times.


So
 I
 just
 don't
 think
 it's
 that
 scary


here
 uh
 when
 we
 think
 of
 Nvidia
 and


their
 uh
 and
 their
 price
 action.
 Okay,


other
 headlines
 that
 we've
 got.
 Um
 Benny


says,
 "When
 will
 Robin
 put
 out
 a


prediction
 market
 for
 when
 Amit's
 going


to
 shave
 his
 beard?"
 That
 is
 a
 great


prediction
 market.
 They
 actually
 should


put
 it
 out.
 That
 would
 be
 hilarious.


Speaking
 of
 prediction
 markets,
 I've


been
 researching
 the
 entire
 field
 a
 lot


over
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 uh
 couple
 of


days.
 I
 mean,
 that
 was
 kind
 of
 like
 one


of
 the
 things
 I
 I
 decided
 to
 research


more
 over
 the
 weekend.
 My
 goodness,
 am
 I


getting
 bullish
 on
 these
 prediction


markets.
 The
 reason
 Robin
 stock
 was
 up


10%
 last
 week,
 even
 though
 crypto
 was


relatively
 flat,
 was
 because
 they
 took
 a


stake
 in
 a
 new
 crypto
 or
 not
 crypto,
 a


market
 making
 subsidiary
 in
 partnership


with
 Susuana.
 And
 essentially,
 Robin


Hood
 is
 telling
 the
 market,
 "We're


eventually
 going
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 Ki
 and


we're
 going
 to
 be
 doing
 the
 market


making
 and
 providing
 the
 liquidity
 for


these
 trades
 by
 ourselves
 which
 is
 going


to
 save
 them
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 Uh
 Poly


Markets
 CEO
 did
 a
 60-minute
 piece
 on
 CBS


yesterday
 and
 I
 I
 can't
 play
 it
 because


CBS
 is
 going
 to
 copyright
 it,
 but
 if
 you


if
 you
 watch
 some
 of
 the
 clips,
 um
 the


way
 he's
 thinking
 about
 prediction


markets
 as
 a
 financial
 ecosystem
 and


institution
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 or
 I


guess
 you
 say
 financial
 product
 to
 price


the
 risk
 of
 everything
 in
 the
 world,


every
 event
 on
 the
 planet,
 which


obviously
 influences
 stock
 prices,
 bond


yields,
 etc.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 incredibly


incredibly
 valuable
 data.
 Financial


institutions
 across
 the
 world
 are
 going


to
 be
 paying
 a
 lot
 for
 that
 data.


They're
 going
 to
 pay
 be
 paying
 a
 lot
 to


help
 market
 make
 on
 that
 data.
 And


they're
 going
 to
 be
 paying
 a
 lot
 to
 make


sure
 they
 can
 gain
 insights
 from
 that


data
 to
 make
 their
 own
 decisions
 across


a
 variety
 of
 other
 assets.
 And
 so
 based


on
 the
 power
 of
 these
 prediction


markets,
 you
 can
 understand
 why
 Robin


Hood
 is
 so
 excited
 to
 to
 take
 a
 real


stake
 and
 develop
 it
 into
 a
 stronger


ecosystem.
 But
 I
 think
 this
 is
 going to


be
 a
 trillion
 dollar
 industry
 over
 the


next
 decade
 because
 you
 just
 you're
 just


going
 to
 have
 more
 and
 more
 people


speculating
 on
 more
 and
 more
 events
 and


as
 it
 becomes
 more
 normalized
 that
 data


is
 going
 to
 become
 intrinsically
 more


important
 and
 the
 companies
 that
 have


the
 best
 distribution
 because
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day
 the
 prediction
 market
 itself


is
 a
 commodity.
 It's
 not
 there's
 nothing


special
 about
 it
 outside
 of
 the
 ability


to
 get
 people's
 attention
 that
 is
 going


to
 be
 very
 attractive.


So
 I
 think
 uh
 I
 I
 I
 think
 I
 think
 the


prediction
 markets
 are
 going
 to
 win
 long


term.
 call.
 She
 did
 get
 hit
 with
 a


pretty
 ugly
 lawsuit
 from
 Nevada
 over
 the


weekend.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 you're
 going


to
 have
 those
 ups
 and
 downs,
 but
 I
 I


think
 it's
 here
 to
 stay
 and
 I
 think


we're
 going to
 get
 more
 and
 more
 of
 our


truth
 from
 these
 prediction
 markets
 long


term.
 The
 other
 thing
 that's
 important


about
 prediction
 markets
 is
 that


look,
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 compare
 it


to
 gambling,
 but
 here's
 a
 simple
 reason


why
 you
 can't
 easily
 compare
 to


gambling.


When
 you
 gamble
 at
 a
 casino,
 there's


something
 called
 the
 house,
 and
 most


people
 have
 heard
 of
 the
 term
 the
 house


always
 wins.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 when
 you're


gambling
 on
 DraftKings
 or
 FanDuel,
 you


are
 betting
 against
 the
 house.
 Like,
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 your
 odds
 inevitably


end
 up
 not
 going
 the
 best
 direction


because
 the
 house
 tends
 to
 win
 more


often
 than
 lose.
 On
 prediction
 markets,


you're
 not
 betting
 against
 the
 house.


You're
 betting
 against
 someone
 else.


So,
 it's
 like
 if
 if
 you
 think
 the
 Lakers


are
 going to
 win
 tonight,
 and
 I
 think


the
 Lakers
 are
 going
 to
 lose
 tonight,


I'm
 not
 betting
 against
 the
 casino
 that


the
 Lakers
 are
 going
 to
 win
 or
 going
 to


lose,
 which
 they
 have
 this
 intrinsic


edge.
 I'm
 betting
 against
 someone
 else


who
 is
 making
 the
 market.


So
 I
 I
 in
 in
 in
 in
 that
 respect
 and
 and


I
 think
 the
 poly
 market
 CEO
 made
 a
 good


point
 about
 this
 last
 night
 like
 these


these
 gambling
 platforms
 and
 people
 have


probably
 had
 experience
 with
 this.
 If


you're
 winning
 too
 much,
 if
 you're
 too


good
 at
 gambling,
 like
 they
 will
 shut


you
 off.
 They
 will
 close
 your
 account
 or


they
 will
 limit
 the
 amount
 of
 uh
 trades


you
 can
 make
 simply
 because
 of
 the
 fact


that
 you
 know
 the
 house
 always
 wins
 and


they
 can't
 have
 someone
 just
 winning


every
 single
 night
 who
 has
 an
 edge.
 This


goes
 back
 to
 like
 counting
 cards
 and


blackjack,
 all
 that
 stuff.
 with


prediction
 markets
 that
 doesn't


necessarily
 exist
 because
 you're
 you're


taking
 other
 people's
 money
 that
 are


betting
 against
 you.
 You're
 not
 taking


the
 house's
 money.
 So,
 is
 there
 still
 a


vague?
 Yeah,
 there's
 probably
 still
 a


vague
 in
 some
 way.
 And
 obviously,
 the


market
 makers
 that
 are
 involved
 in
 this


probably
 get
 their
 split
 as
 well,
 but


it's
 not
 intrinsically
 the
 same
 as


betting
 against
 the
 house.


So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think
 there's
 some


nuances
 here.
 And
 again,
 yeah,
 someone


said
 that's
 true.
 It's
 happened
 to
 me.


It's
 happened
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 as
 I


was
 researching
 over
 the
 weekend
 as
 well


that
 there
 there's
 there
 there's
 more


and
 more.
 And
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 like
 as
 I


was
 looking
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 see
 what
 is


you
 know
 the
 differentiation
 between


prediction
 markets
 and
 like
 just


straight
 up
 draftings.
 And
 in
 one


there's
 a
 house
 in
 one
 there's
 two


people
 that
 are
 like
 Kla
 Harris
 or


Donald
 Trump.
 You
 have
 two
 people
 that


are
 individually
 reflecting
 their
 own


opinions
 on
 who
 they
 think
 is
 going
 to


win
 the
 election.
 You
 don't
 have
 a
 house


that's
 deciding
 it's
 Harris
 or
 deciding


it's
 Trump.
 So
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think


there's
 a
 nuance
 to
 kind
 of
 how
 this
 is


all
 playing
 out.
 I
 also
 think
 as
 a


hedging
 tool,
 for
 example,
 if
 your
 stock


market
 portfolio
 is
 very
 uh
 open
 to,
 you


know,
 rate
 cut
 volatility,
 if
 you
 are


long
 Nvidia
 and
 then
 we
 don't
 get
 a
 rate


cut,
 but
 you
 bet
 no
 on
 a
 prediction


market
 that
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 a


rate
 cut,
 your
 Nvidia
 stock
 might
 go


down,
 but
 your
 prediction
 might
 go
 up.


And
 if
 your
 prediction
 goes
 down,
 then


that's
 your
 hedge
 that
 went
 to
 zero,
 but


your
 Nvidia
 stock
 went
 up.
 So,
 I
 think


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 speculation


tools
 in
 this.
 I
 can
 understand
 why


Robinet
 wants
 to
 make
 this
 a
 big


industry,
 and
 I
 think
 it
 will
 continue


to
 become
 a
 big
 industry.

 Bank

America
 originally
 did
 not
 think
 we
 were


going
 to
 get
 this
 rate
 cut
 and
 they've


changed
 their
 mind.
 Why
 did
 they
 change


their
 mind?
 Well,
 it
 seems
 kind
 of


obvious
 now
 that
 we
 are
 going
 to
 get


this
 Fed
 rate
 cut
 as
 Fed
 President


Williams
 and
 Fed
 President
 Dolly
 have


signified
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 rate


cut.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 it's
 hard
 for
 some


of
 these
 big
 banks
 to
 continue
 to


imagine
 that
 this
 rate
 cut
 is
 not
 going


to
 happen.
 On
 top
 of
 that,
 you
 had
 a


really
 successful
 Black
 Friday.
 Here's


what
 Toby
 Luke,
 the
 CEO
 of
 Shopify,
 had


to
 say
 as
 well.

 a
 second
 from


the
 queries
 on
 the
 database
 and
 the
 API


uh
 process
 over
 31
 million
 requests
 per


minute
 at
 their
 peak.
 So
 Shopify
 had
 a


massive
 massive
 Black
 Friday
 25%


year-over-year.
 Every
 year
 they've
 been


compounding
 at
 around
 20
 to
 25%
 showing


again
 maybe
 the
 consumer
 isn't
 as
 weak


as
 we
 think.
 Adobe
 Analytics
 say
 that
 US


online
 Black
 Friday
 sales
 hit
 a
 record


11.8
 8
 billion
 up
 9%
 year-over-year
 with


another
 5
 billion
 expected
 on
 Saturday,


6
 billion
 on
 Sunday
 and
 Cyber
 Monday


which
 is
 today
 projecting
 14.2


billion.
 Salesforce
 is
 spent
 is


imagining
 Black
 Friday
 spendable
 coming


in
 at
 about
 18
 billion
 up
 3%


year-over-year.
 So
 look,
 if
 we
 think
 the


consumer
 is
 okay
 and
 we
 think
 we're


getting
 rate
 cuts,
 you
 can
 understand


why
 Bank
 of
 America
 is
 saying,
 "All


right,
 we
 have
 to
 kind
 of
 tweak
 our
 call


on
 how
 we
 think
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 year
 is


going
 to
 end
 up
 playing
 out
 and
 why
 a


lot
 of
 these
 firms
 continue
 to
 have
 this


like
 $7,000
 to
 $7,500
 target
 because


there
 just
 might
 be
 a
 chance
 for
 the


macro
 to
 tune
 in
 in
 the
 favor
 of
 the


bulls."
 And
 then
 on
 top
 of
 that,
 you
 got


this
 from
 Hasset
 or
 you
 got
 this
 from


Trump.
 Trump
 said
 that
 he's
 made
 a


decision
 on
 who
 is
 going to
 be
 the
 Fed


chair.
 He
 has
 not
 explicitly
 said
 it's


going to
 be
 Hasset,
 but
 pretty
 much
 all


of
 us
 know
 it's
 going to
 be
 Hasset.


Hasset
 did
 say
 over
 the
 weekend
 that
 if


Trump
 were
 to
 pick
 him,
 then,
 you
 know,


basically
 he
 implied
 that
 he
 would
 be
 uh


uh
 let's
 just
 say
 obedient.
 He
 didn't


use
 that
 exact
 word,
 but
 it
 would
 be


pretty
 uh
 on
 par
 for
 what
 it
 means
 for


Trump's
 agenda.
 And
 so,
 you'll
 likely


get
 some
 rate
 cuts.
 So
 I
 think
 if
 the


consumer
 is
 decent,
 which
 again
 all
 the


retailer
 uh
 companies
 that
 reported
 last


week,
 whether
 it
 was
 Abberrombi
 or


Kohl's
 or
 Best
 Buy
 or
 Urban
 Outfitters,


I
 I
 just
 could
 not
 believe
 the
 numbers


that
 we
 were
 seeing
 to
 the
 upside.
 And


then
 you
 had
 Black
 Friday
 that
 turned


out
 to
 be
 pretty
 good.
 Again,
 Shopify
 up


25%
 year-over-year.
 Someone's
 spending


that
 money
 to
 buy
 these
 products
 on


Shopify.
 And
 that
 is
 probably
 a
 consumer


that
 is
 getting
 ready
 to
 that
 to
 spend


more
 for
 the
 holidays,
 which
 means
 there


is
 some
 more
 disposable
 income.
 and


you've
 got
 some
 monetary
 easing
 in
 place


or
 getting
 ready
 to
 be
 in
 place
 with
 the


end
 of
 QT
 and
 the
 beginning
 of
 further


rate
 cuts.
 Uh
 and
 then
 earnings
 continue


to
 be
 where
 they
 have
 to
 be.
 I
 mean,


maybe
 it's
 not
 too
 bad.
 Maybe
 it's
 not


too
 bad.
 So,
 I
 think
 the
 sell-off
 this


morning
 is
 more
 to
 do
 with
 what's
 going


on
 with
 crypto
 in
 Japan,
 but
 we
 will


find
 out
 over
 the
 coming
 days
 kind
 of


how
 this
 is
 playing
 out.
 By
 the
 way,


Piper
 Sandler
 also
 said
 the
 same
 thing


this
 morning.
 Piper
 Sandler
 said,
 uh,


"It's
 hard
 to
 imagine
 that
 the
 consumer


is
 as
 weak
 as
 as
 it
 is."
 She
 says,


"Concerns
 about
 a
 weakening
 US
 economy


might
 be
 overstated.
 Historically,
 solid


consumer
 spending
 has
 helped
 revive
 job


markets
 after
 slowdowns
 with
 profit


strong.
 They
 expect
 hiring
 to
 pick
 up
 by


the
 second
 quarter
 of
 2026
 and
 says


early
 signs
 of
 job
 growth
 are
 already


appearing,
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 we
 saw


in
 that
 labor
 market
 data
 last
 week
 as


well.
 The
 jobs
 claims
 came
 in
 at
 216,000


versus
 220,000,
 which
 is
 way
 better
 than


expected.
 It's
 nowhere
 near
 the


recession
 at
 350,000
 jobs
 um
 a
 week
 we


should
 be
 losing.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 that


might
 be
 securing
 a
 little
 bit
 more


macro
 to
 or
 securing
 a
 little
 bit
 more


uh
 frameworks
 for
 the
 macro
 to
 not
 be
 in


as
 bad
 of
 a
 situation
 as
 you
 know
 we


thought
 it
 was
 going to
 be
 last
 week


when
 we
 weren't
 getting
 a
 rake
 up.


And
 so
 over
 the
 coming
 weeks
 I
 think


we'll
 get
 more
 details
 and
 we'll
 get
 a


lot
 more
 macro
 data
 as
 well
 to
 see
 how


this
 plays
 out.
 And
 they
 secured
 an
 $


8.2
 2
 million
 order
 from
 another
 major


European
 airport
 to
 that
 stock.
 Are
 we


green?
 It
 was
 down
 last
 week.
 It's
 down


1.5.
 It
 was
 up
 30%
 after
 earnings.
 So,


for
 those
 that
 are
 bullish
 on
 us,
 this


one
 has
 been
 executing
 pretty
 well.
 I


don't
 know
 that
 much
 about
 the
 company.


I
 know
 they
 are
 a
 drone
 platform,
 but


they've
 been
 definitely
 getting
 a
 lot


more
 attention
 in
 the
 drone
 space.
 By


the
 way,
 Kratos
 was
 upgraded
 to
 a
 buy,


another
 drone
 company
 today.
 Joby


actually
 got
 downgraded
 to
 a
 sell
 price


target
 of
 $10
 by
 Goldman
 Sachs.
 Joby


right
 there


down
 about
 5%


as
 well
 on
 the
 day.
 Yeah,
 we
 talked


about
 the
 Amazon
 Google
 multi
 cloud


networking
 service.
 Uh
 Amazon
 and
 Google


have
 collaborated
 for
 years
 together.


So,
 it
 makes
 sense
 that
 they're


continuing
 to
 come
 together.
 But
 you're


seeing
 more
 and
 more
 of
 the
 hyperscalers


work
 in
 tandem
 with
 each
 other.
 By
 the


way,
 here's
 that
 report
 I
 was
 telling


about
 Morgan
 Stanley
 and
 their
 upgrade


on
 Google's
 AI
 chip
 sales.
 So
 Morgan


Stanley
 sees
 Alphabet
 selling
 12
 million


TPUs
 over
 the
 next
 two
 years.
 Uh
 that's


up
 double.
 They
 thought
 it
 was
 6


million.
 Now
 they
 think
 it's
 12
 million.


Every
 500,000
 TPUs
 could
 add
 13
 billion


in
 revenue
 to
 Google.
 Pretty
 bullish.


Could
 contribute
 40
 cents
 of
 EPS
 to


Google
 in
 2027
 alone.
 The
 surge
 in


demand
 is
 likely
 tied
 to
 AI
 workloads


and
 GCP
 expansion.
 Also,
 the
 idea
 that


Meta
 is
 buying
 it
 is
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot


of
 people
 to
 wonder,
 hey,
 maybe
 we


should
 be
 buying
 this
 over
 Nvidia.


Jensen
 again
 is
 going
 to
 be
 live
 in


about
 five
 minutes
 on
 CNBC.
 So,
 we'll


see
 what
 he
 has
 to
 say
 about
 this
 new


deal,
 $2
 billion
 investment
 in
 synopsis.


Uh
 Morgan
 Stanley
 thinks
 that
 there's


going
 to
 be a
 strong
 supply
 chain


confidence
 in
 Asia.
 Increase
 in


production
 signals
 new
 TPU
 monetization


strategy.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 they
 think


these
 TCPU
 sale
 or
 TPU
 sales
 may


complement
 GCP
 offerings
 for


Google.
 So,
 I
 don't
 think
 this
 is


bearish
 Nvidia.
 I
 think
 it's
 bullish


Google.
 I
 know
 people
 are
 trying
 to


paint
 it
 as
 bearish
 Nvidia,
 which
 again,


I
 think
 I
 think
 anything
 bearish
 Nvidia


is
 bearish.
 not
 only
 the
 entire
 market,


but
 for
 the
 people
 that
 think
 Nvidia
 is


just
 going
 to
 die
 and
 another
 company
 is


just
 going
 to
 win,
 I
 think
 are


fundamentally
 misanalyzing
 the
 the


competitive
 ecosystem.
 If
 Nvidia
 dies,
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 companies
 are
 falling


with
 it.
 Not
 to
 mention
 all
 the
 supply


chains
 that
 Google
 would
 have
 to
 be


using
 as
 well
 as
 Nvidia
 to
 be
 able
 to


even
 get
 to
 the
 level
 of
 um
 production


that
 Nvidia
 is
 doing
 at
 scale.
 So,
 I
 I I


I
 don't
 think
 I
 don't
 think
 Nvidia
 is


dead.
 I
 think
 Nvidia
 will
 be
 fine.
 And
 I


think
 Google
 will
 be
 fine
 as
 well.
 This


is
 very
 bullish
 for
 Google,
 but
 this
 is


not
 bearish
 for
 Nvidia
 in
 my
 opinion.


Speaking
 of
 Nvidia,
 I
 mean,
 take
 a
 look


at
 this
 chart
 right
 here.
 Three
 years


ago
 on
 November
 30th,
 Chat
 GBT
 was


announced.
 Since
 then,
 the
 S&P
 500
 has


added
 $24
 trillion
 of
 market
 cap,


which
 is
 2900
 points
 from
 basically


3,600
 to
 2,800.
 That's
 22
 billion
 per


day
 for
 the
 past
 1,096
 days.
 That
 is
 why


this
 has
 been
 one
 of
 the
 greatest


three-year
 stretches
 in
 history
 for
 the


stock
 market
 because
 we
 just
 haven't
 had


a
 technology
 that's
 been
 able
 to
 do
 what


uh
 what
 AI
 has
 been
 able
 to
 do
 and
 add


the
 type
 of
 market
 cap
 that
 it's
 added.


The
 question
 is
 does
 this
 all
 end
 with
 a


massive
 bust
 or
 does
 this
 end
 with
 you


know
 continued
 stability
 as
 AI
 just


increases
 earnings
 and
 productivity
 at


scale
 and
 hoping
 it's
 the
 latter
 but
 you


got
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 speculating
 on
 if
 it


would
 be
 uh
 the
 former.
 Let's
 finish
 up


with
 Tom
 Lee.
 We
 got
 3
 minutes
 until
 the


market
 opens.
 We
 will
 get
 the
 market


open
 and
 then
 we
 will
 get
 Jensen
 on
 and


then
 we
 will
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> Uh
 a
 dump,
 a
 decline,
 sorry.
 Um
 maybe


because
 the
 Bank
 of
 Japan
 looks
 hawkish,


>> but
 um
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 four-year


cycle
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 Bitcoin
 high
 is


in
 place,
 but
 you're
 right.
 Uh
 you
 know,


we
 were
 too
 optimistic
 about
 this


happening
 by
 December.
 But
 I
 do
 think


Bitcoin
 can
 make
 an
 all-time
 high
 by
 the


end
 of
 January.
 So
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 we


should
 we
 should
 think
 the
 highs
 are
 in


place
 for
 Bitcoin
 or
 Ethereum
 or
 crypto.


So
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 it's
 going
 to
 depend
 on


equities
 recovering
 which
 we
 expect
 it


to
 and
 that
 helps
 the
 animal
 spirits
 and


I
 think
 a
 new
 Fed
 share
 will
 help.
 And


we
 have,
 as
 Becky
 said,
 when
 people
 got


worried
 about
 a
 hawkish
 Fed,
 that
 kind


of
 hurts
 the
 discount
 models,
 the


discounted
 cash
 models
 like
 AI
 models,


but
 it
 hurts
 crypto
 models,
 too.
 So,
 if


we
 have
 a
 dovish
 Fed,
 that's
 really
 a


tailwind.


>> He's
 right
 about
 that.
 Obviously,
 a


dovish
 fend
 is
 a
 tailwind.
 I
 guess
 the


question
 is
 how
 much
 of
 a
 tailwind
 is
 it


for
 crypto?
 And
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,


the
 idea
 that
 Bitcoin
 gets
 to
 100K
 or


Ethereum
 gets
 to
 4,200
 again
 quickly,
 I


mean,
 maybe
 it
 happens.
 Tom
 Lee
 still


thinks
 the
 best
 10
 days
 in
 a
 year
 define


crypto
 or
 define
 like
 Bitcoin's
 price


action
 and
 maybe
 those
 best
 10
 days
 have


yet
 to
 happen.
 And
 if
 it
 does
 happen


towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year,
 then
 you


get
 a
 massive
 run.
 If
 so,
 then
 Bitmine,


Micro
 Strategy,
 those
 companies
 should


do
 well.
 Bit
 mine
 announced
 today
 they


now
 have
 3.73
 million
 ETH
 tokens.
 Uh


they
 control
 now
 more
 than
 3%
 of
 the


entire
 ETH
 supply.
 They
 will
 begin


staking
 in
 the
 first
 half
 of
 2026.
 12.1


billion882
 million
 in
 cash,
 3.73
 million


Ethereum.
 They
 bought
 96,798


ETH
 uh
 over
 the
 last
 week.
 So,
 he


continues
 to
 buy
 the
 dip
 and
 if
 that
 dip


ends
 up
 working
 out,
 then
 you
 know,
 you


will
 have
 a
 world
 in
 which
 ETH


appreciates.
 But
 at
 this
 point,
 you
 kind


of
 have
 to
 buy
 the
 dip
 if
 you
 believe


that
 Ethereum
 is
 going
 to
 be
 what
 people


think
 it's
 going
 to
 be.
 All
 right,


folks.
 Here
 we
 go.
 Thank
 everybody
 for


being
 here.
 Hopefully,
 everyone
 had
 a


great
 weekend.
 Very,
 very
 thankful
 for


all
 of
 you
 being
 here
 and
 thankful
 to
 be


back
 and
 in
 action.
 It
 was
 a
 good
 break.


But
 once
 again,
 the
 stock
 market
 is
 now


open.


All
 right.
 It's
 been
 a
 while
 since
 the


bell,
 but
 we
 are
 back.
 Wake
 your
 ass
 up.


Here
 we
 go.
 Google
 opens
 up
 at
 319.


That
 is
 down
 about.39%
 on
 the
 day.
 And


on
 we
 had
 that
 announcement
 in
 the


morning.
 8.2
 million
 from
 European


airport.
 That's
 actually
 up
 51%
 in
 the


sea
 of
 red,
 which
 is
 incredible.
 So
 that


stock
 really
 getting
 some
 love
 right


here.
 Joby
 down
 6%
 after
 the
 downgrade


today
 from
 Goldman
 Sachs.
 Nvidia
 down


1.28%.
 S&P
 500
 down.5%.
 Intel
 down


1.18%.
 Intel
 was
 up
 10%
 on
 Friday
 based


on
 a
 rumor
 of
 them
 working
 with
 Apple.


Not
 confirmed,
 but
 that
 really
 helped


the
 stock
 back
 on
 Friday.
 Amazon
 is
 flat


on
 the
 day,
 232.
 Amazon
 actually
 one
 of


the
 only
 Mac
 7s
 that's
 actually
 that's


flat.
 Everything
 else
 is
 pretty
 much


down.
 Tesla's
 down
 about
 1%.
 Michael
 Bur


did
 say
 Tesla
 stock
 is
 ridiculously


overvalued
 over
 the
 weekend.
 So,
 looks


like
 he's
 coming
 after
 Tesla
 now.
 Robin


Hood
 down
 4%.
 Micro
 Strategy
 down
 6%.


MSTR
 is
 getting
 hit
 right
 here.
 Rivian's


down
 one.
 Oscar
 is
 down
 three.
 Oracle
 is


down
 1.3.
 Oracle
 back
 below
 200.
 Nebius


holding
 90,
 but
 that's
 down
 4%.


Coreweave
 down
 4%.
 Oh,
 Dan
 Ies
 added


Coreweave
 to
 his
 Ives
 AI30.


So,
 he
 um
 is
 getting
 a
 bit
 more
 bullish


on
 the
 Neoclouds.
 And
 so,
 you
 got


Coreeave
 that
 although
 their
 debt
 has


continued
 to
 stack
 up
 as
 aggressively
 as


it
 has.
 Um
 it's
 kind
 of
 creating
 the


pain.
 He
 took
 off
 uh
 Salesforce
 Service


Now
 and
 Soundhound
 and
 he
 added


Coreweave
 Ian
 and
 Shopify.
 took
 off


Salesforce.
 I
 ran
 or
 Salesforce

Now
 and
 um
 and
 uh
 Soundhound
 and
 then
 I


ran
 Corey
 added.
 Weeble
 that's
 down
 4%.


Roblox
 that's
 down
 2%.
 Reddit
 that's


down
 2%.
 Uber
 or
 Uber
 that's
 down
 1%.


Wingstop
 down
 1%.
 Cheesecake
 down
 1.4.


Microsoft
 down
 1%.
 Apple
 down
 half%.


Apploving
 that's
 down
 3.3%
 as
 well.
 I'm


going
 to
 switch
 over
 to
 Jensen.
 He
 is


live
 right
 now.
 This
 is
 another
 $2


billion
 investment
 that
 the
 company
 has


made.
 This
 is
 joining
 a
 string
 of


investments
 they've
 made
 over
 the
 past


couple
 of
 weeks.
 So,
 let's
 pull
 that
 up


and
 see
 what
 they
 have
 to
 say
 here.


>> All
 right,
 here's
 their
 software
 and
 all


the
 tools
 that
 the
 the
 industry
 the


world's
 been
 using
 for
 some
 35
 years
 to


be
 GPU
 accelerated
 on
 Nvidia.
 They're


going
 to
 pivot
 the
 company
 to
 build
 on


top
 of
 NVIDIA
 CUDA
 physics
 physical
 AI


as
 well
 as
 Omniverse
 so
 that
 we
 could


revolutionize
 all
 of
 these
 tools
 from


EDA
 to
 SDA
 system
 design
 automation
 to


CAE
 to
 computer
 AED
 drug
 discovery.
 This


is
 going
 to
 expand
 the
 market
 of


computing
 into
 the
 world
 of
 design
 and


engineering
 for
 the
 very
 first
 time.


This
 partnership
 is
 going
 to
 be


revolutionary
 for
 that
 entire
 industry,


expanding
 their
 TAM,
 expanding
 the


capabilities.
 You
 know
 what's
 really


amazing,
 Jim?
 This
 is
 really
 the


culmination
 of
 everything
 I
 showed
 you


when
 you
 visited
 Nvidia
 years
 ago.
 It's


taken
 this
 long
 for
 us
 to
 create
 the


software
 stack
 necessary
 for


>> BMR
 down
 10%.
 BMR
 Micro
 Strategy
 getting


hit.
 A
 lot
 of
 those
 crypto
 derivative


plays
 getting
 hit
 pretty
 bad
 this


morning.
 synopsis
 and
 the
 rest
 of
 the


EDA
 industry
 and
 SDA
 industry
 in
 order


for
 them
 to
 accelerate
 the
 software
 that


they've
 historically
 only
 ran
 on
 CPUs.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 we're
 able
 to
 do


simulations
 at
 a
 speed
 and
 scale


unimaginable
 in
 the
 past
 so
 that
 we


could
 do
 basically
 the
 entire


engineering
 work
 inside
 a
 computer
 in
 a


digital
 twin
 before
 we
 have
 to
 build
 it


at
 all.
 So
 the
 the
 type
 of
 products
 we


can
 invent
 and
 the
 quality
 that
 we
 could


do
 and
 the
 speed
 that
 we
 could
 do
 it
 at


is
 going
 to
 be
 extraordinary.


>> Right?
 I
 think
 that
 when
 you
 first


introduced
 this
 to
 me,
 you
 explained
 to


me
 over
 and
 over
 again
 because
 I
 was
 so


fascinated
 by
 by
 what
 could
 happen
 with


a
 chat
 GPT
 with
 the
 prompts
 was
 Jim


that's
 business
 to
 consumer
 and
 it's


really
 really
 important.
 But
 you
 better


start
 thinking
 enterprise.
 Enterprise
 is


you
 were
 using
 a
 number
 that
 is
 10
 times


the
 size
 of
 what
 I
 was
 thinking
 about.


Are
 you
 still
 standing
 by
 that?


Absolutely.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 what
 we're


doing
 today,
 if
 you
 look,
 we've
 been


partnering
 with
 Synopsis
 for
 a
 very
 long


time.
 You
 NVIDIA
 was
 built
 on
 a


foundation
 of
 design
 tools
 from
 Synopsis


and
 of
 course
 many
 other
 companies
 like


Cadence
 and
 and
 uh
 uh
 Seammens
 and
 Dau.


These
 are
 very
 important
 companies
 that


the
 entire
 engineering
 industry
 is
 built


on
 top
 of
 as
 a
 result
 of
 what
 we're
 able


to
 do
 today.
 We're
 able
 to
 bring
 GPU


accelerated
 computing,
 Nvidia's
 CUDA


into
 the
 world's
 industrial
 sector
 for


the
 very
 first
 time.
 This
 is
 this
 is
 uh


physics,
 physical
 AI.
 This
 is
 AI
 that


obeys
 the
 laws
 of
 physics
 that
 AI
 that


interacts
 with
 the
 physical
 world.
 This


is
 extremely
 complex
 stuff.
 It's
 taken


us
 years
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 this.
 And
 now


if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 world's
 industrial


sector,
 it's
 measured
 in
 trillions
 of


dollars.
 So
 for
 both
 Nvidia
 and
 Synopsis


and
 the
 entire
 industry,
 this
 is
 a
 giant


expansion
 of
 opportunity.


>> All
 right.
 So
 we'll
 go
 back
 to
 that
 in
 a


bit.
 Jensen
 not
 really
 saying
 anything


that
 we
 don't
 already
 know.
 It's
 another


partnership
 and
 that
 partnership
 should


be
 expanding
 the
 tamper
 accelerated


computing
 which
 you
 know
 is
 is
 bullish


but
 it's
 not
 like
 the
 market
 doesn't


fully
 understand
 that
 yet.
 S&P
 500
 right


there
 679
 still
 down
 about.56%.
 Nvidia


getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 pump


potentially
 from
 Jensen
 talking
 right


there.
 We'll
 hear
 from
 the
 synopsis
 CEO


in
 a
 little
 bit
 on
 their
 perspective,


but
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 has
 to
 do
 with


physical
 AI
 and
 the
 omniverse,
 uh,


Invidios's
 platform
 using
 synthetic
 data


to
 train.
 And
 so,
 it
 seems
 like
 that's


where
 the
 collaboration
 is
 stemming
 from


as
 well.
 Amazon
 actually
 going
 green
 is


interesting
 today.
 I
 kind
 of
 have
 this


theory
 that's
 just
 a
 random
 theory,
 but


I
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 too
 controversial


that
 Amazon's
 probably
 the
 next
 one
 to


go
 to
 300
 now
 that
 Google's
 done
 it.
 And


for
 Amazon,
 my
 my
 logic
 is
 very
 simple.


AWS
 is
 expanding
 and
 accelerating
 since


2022
 as
 per
 the
 last
 uh
 uh
 earnings
 call


and
 robotics
 will
 increase
 operating


margins
 like
 it's
 a
 very
 simple
 thesis.


AWS
 is
 growing
 accelerating
 not
 just


growing
 and
 operating
 margins
 should


inflect
 over
 the
 next
 five
 years
 which


should
 get
 the
 stock
 higher.
 So
 you
 know


maybe
 the
 market
 is
 looking
 for


mispriced
 Max
 Evans
 and
 Amazon
 is


popping
 up.
 Meta
 by
 the
 way
 had
 an


amazing
 run
 last
 week.
 Meta
 639
 that's


down
 1.2
 recovering
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 it


lost
 in
 the
 pre-market.
 uh
 Meta
 was
 at


585
 now
 basically
 touching
 640.
 So
 if


anyone
 bought
 that
 585
 dip
 you
 are
 doing


pretty
 well.
 There
 is
 an
 argument
 that


whether
 it's
 a
 TPU
 or
 a
 GPU
 if
 Meta
 has


to
 pay
 less
 and
 get
 more
 return
 on
 their


investment
 and
 that
 is
 something
 that


the
 market's
 going
 to
 care
 about
 which


is
 bullish
 for
 them.
 Nvidia
 trying
 to


recover
 and
 go
 green
 trying
 to
 recover


and
 go
 green.
 BMR
 also
 I
 mean
 it
 was


down
 10
 now
 it's
 down
 eight.
 So
 you
 got


a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 green
 candle
 right


there.
 And
 Tesla
 goes
 green.
 430
 on


Tesla.
 Wow.


So
 Tesla's
 the
 first
 Mac
 7
 to
 officially


go
 green
 today.
 Google
 is
 still
 red.


Apple
 is
 still
 red.
 Meta's
 still
 red.


Meta
 although
 looks
 like
 it's
 about
 to


go
 green.
 Microsoft
 as
 well
 is
 still


red.
 Again,
 I
 ran
 Corweave
 and
 Shopify


were
 the
 ones
 that
 were
 added
 into
 the


Dan
 Ies
 AI30,
 his
 top
 30
 AI
 names
 going


into
 2026.
 He
 took
 out
 Salesforce,


Soundhound
 and
 um
 uh
 Service
 Now,
 which


I
 think
 is
 reasonable.
 You
 take
 out
 some


software
 players
 for
 two
 NeoClouds
 and


then
 I
 mean
 Sound
 I
 never
 fully


understood.
 Looks
 like
 he
 replaced
 that


with
 Shopify.
 Shopify
 is
 just
 like
 a


phenomenal
 company.
 Looks
 like
 AI
 is


going to
 be
 a
 massive
 tailwind
 for
 them


as
 well.
 So
 maybe
 that's
 why
 those


stocks
 are
 getting
 some
 green.
 Uh


Microsoft
 right
 there
 486.
 I
 ren
 also


getting
 a
 green
 candle.
 That
 one's
 only


down
 about
 2.86%.


on
 the
 day
 as
 well.
 Oracle,
 do
 we
 have


Oracle
 green?
 Not
 yet.
 Oracle
 still
 down


197.81.
 Again,
 their
 credit
 default


swaps
 last
 week
 was
 of
 much
 discussion.


Eli
 Liy
 continues
 to
 go
 higher.
 Market


potentially
 continuing
 to
 rotate
 into


healthcare.
 Open
 doors
 down
 3%.
 Apples


down
 2.5%.
 You
 got
 an
 upgrade
 on
 Reddit.


Piper
 Sandler,
 we
 like
 the
 setup
 for


Reddit
 into
 2026.
 Price
 target
 290
 on


Reddit.


Okay,
 so
 you
 got
 an
 Reddit
 actually
 is


the
 next
 deep
 dive
 I'll
 be
 doing.
 Think


that
 should
 be
 out
 by
 this
 Saturday.
 So,


we
 will
 get
 to
 know
 Reddit
 a
 bit
 deeper.


Let's
 go
 back
 to
 Jensen
 and
 the
 synopsis


CEO
 and
 see
 what
 they
 have
 to
 say.


>> Wait
 a
 second.


>> Solutions
 for
 semiconductor
 design
 and


verification.
 With
 the
 NS
 acquisition,


it
 expands
 our
 time
 for
 every


engineering
 workload.
 Think
 about
 any


product
 that
 you
 just
 mentioned,
 be
 it


automotive,
 robotics,
 drones,
 machinery


for
 industries,
 they're
 getting
 so


sophisticated,
 they're
 going
 to
 become


AIdriven,
 meaning
 to
 design
 these


systems,
 you
 need
 sophisticated


engineering
 solutions
 in
 order
 to


deliver
 these
 systems
 on
 time,
 deal
 with


the
 complexity
 at
 a
 cost
 that
 is


affordable.
 So
 now
 with
 the
 answers


portfolio
 it
 expanded
 our
 time


significantly.
 In
 order
 to
 deliver
 these


solutions
 and
 delivering
 it
 in
 in
 time


for
 the
 customer
 to
 be
 able
 to
 simulate


you
 need
 acceleration
 be
 it
 a
 GPU
 be
 it


AI
 to
 change
 the
 workflow
 digital
 twin


of
 the
 whole
 system.
 You


>> imagine
 he
 said
 be
 it
 a
 GPU
 be
 it
 a
 TPU


J
 would
 have
 punched
 him
 in
 the
 face


bro.
 He's
 like,
 "Don't
 say
 those
 three


letters.
 You
 replace
 the
 G
 with
 a
 T
 and


my
 stock
 is
 going
 to
 fall
 another
 300


billion
 in
 market
 cap."
 So,
 thankfully,


he
 didn't
 say
 TPU.
 You


>> need
 to
 re-engineer
 engineering
 in
 order


to
 deliver
 to
 these
 sophisticated
 uh


future
 products.


>> Wow.
 Re-engineer
 engineering.
 I
 I
 I'm


looking
 at
 Carl's
 just


>> going
 through
 a
 platform
 shift
 from


classical
 general
 purpose
 computing


running
 on
 CPUs
 to
 a
 new
 way
 of
 doing


computing,
 accelerated
 computing
 running


on
 GPUs.
 that
 old
 way
 of
 doing
 is
 going


to
 continue
 to
 to
 uh
 uh
 exist
 of
 course


but
 the
 the
 world
 is
 shifting
 to
 this


new
 way
 of
 doing
 computing
 that
 the
 cash


flow
 of
 the
 world's
 hyperscalers
 are
 at


the
 core
 really
 about
 supporting
 this


platform
 shift
 with
 or
 without
 agentic


AI
 with
 or
 without
 chat
 bots
 the
 world's


hyperscalers
 would
 have
 made
 this


platform
 shift
 anyhow
 because
 this
 is
 a


much
 more
 efficient
 way
 of
 doing


computing
 the
 general
 purp
 uh
 general


internal
 purpose
 computing
 has
 really


run
 its
 course.
 Mo's
 law
 as
 you
 know
 is


slowing
 tremendously
 and
 so
 the
 world


needs
 a
 a
 more
 powerful
 more
 capable
 way


of
 doing
 computing
 going
 forward
 and
 so


at
 the
 at
 the
 foundation
 is
 that
 the


second
 thing
 that
 to
 realize
 is
 that
 AI


is
 not
 just
 chat
 bots
 chatbots
 are


incredible
 cognitive
 co
 cognition
 AI
 is


very
 important
 but
 AI
 covers
 the
 entire


world
 of
 physical
 AI
 industrial
 AI


robotics
 sciences
 digital
 biology
 ology


AI
 is
 going
 to
 transform
 every
 single


industry.
 This
 is
 the
 part
 that
 we've


been
 talking
 about
 for
 a
 very
 long
 time.


You
 and
 I
 have
 been
 talking
 about
 this


literally
 for
 years.
 It's
 just
 less


visible
 because
 consumers
 don't
 have
 to


use
 engineering
 tools
 that
 we
 use
 from


Synopsis
 and
 Cadence
 and
 others.
 We


don't,
 you
 know,
 our
 companies
 use
 these


tools
 because
 it's
 missionritical
 to
 us.


These
 industrial
 applications,
 these


industrial
 tools
 where
 accelerated


computing
 and
 AI
 are
 now
 in
 the
 process


of
 revolutionizing
 are
 foundational
 to


our
 industries.
 It's
 not
 optional
 to
 us.


It's
 missionritical
 to
 us.
 And
 now
 for


the
 first
 time,
 we're
 at
 the
 tipping


point
 of
 that
 and
 we're
 going
 to


revolutionize
 the
 industrial
 software


industry
 with
 it.
 And
 just
 to
 give
 you
 a


sense,
 Jim,
 what
 what
 Jensen's
 referring


to,
 you're
 taking
 a
 workload
 that
 may


run
 for
 two,
 three
 weeks
 and
 reducing
 it


to
 hours.
 And
 that's
 the
 value
 we're


delivering
 to
 the
 customers
 through
 this


partnership
 and
 accelerating
 the


software
 on
 GPU
 from
 Nvidia.


>> Right.
 Although
 Jensen,
 I'm
 sure
 you
 can


sympathize
 with
 viewers
 who
 are
 trying


to
 keep
 up
 with
 just
 your
 deal
 flow.


We're
 we're
 trying
 to
 keep
 up
 with
 your


deal
 flow.
 Um,
 and
 I
 guess
 you
 must
 I'm


wondering
 your
 communication
 strategy.


How
 do
 you
 keep
 people
 afloat
 when
 they


can't
 be
 expected
 to
 understand
 that


view
 from
 40,000
 ft?


>> Well,
 just
 kind
 of
 keep
 trying
 harder.


Carl,
 I
 think
 that
 the
 the
 important


concept
 here,


>> you
 can
 tell
 Jensen's
 a
 little
 annoyed,


right?
 Like
 even
 the
 way
 he
 said
 it,


well,
 we're
 going
 to
 keep
 trying
 hard.


goes.
 It's
 consistent
 with
 the
 memo
 that


got
 leaked
 from
 the
 Nvidia
 old
 hands


meeting
 two
 weeks
 ago
 after
 earnings,


which
 is
 that
 Jensen's
 like,
 "Dude,
 if


if
 we
 win,
 people
 say
 we're
 a
 bubble.
 If


we
 lose,
 people
 say
 the
 bubble's


popping."
 So,
 you
 could
 tell
 he's
 just


trying
 to
 get
 people
 to
 realize
 this
 is


real.
 The
 demand
 is
 real.
 The
 earnings


are
 real.
 We're
 not
 Enron.
 AI
 is
 very


real.
 And
 you
 either
 believe
 it
 or
 you


don't.
 And
 as
 a
 result
 of
 people
 not


believing
 it,
 I
 think
 that's
 what's


making
 Nvidia
 one
 of
 the
 cheaper
 Mac
 7s


right
 now


>> is
 that
 accelerated
 computing
 and
 AI
 is


revolutionizing
 every
 single
 industry.


Of
 course,
 it
 started
 in
 the
 consumer


segment.
 And
 the
 reason
 why
 cons
 starts


in
 the
 consumer
 segment
 is
 because


getting
 the
 answer
 90%
 right
 is
 a
 pretty


magical
 thing,
 but
 the
 industrial


segment
 that
 10%
 you
 don't
 get
 right


becomes
 mission
 critical.
 And
 so
 it


takes
 longer
 for
 us
 to
 create
 the
 tools,


create
 the
 technology
 necessary
 for
 the


industrial
 se
 sectors,
 the
 enterprise


segments
 to
 be
 able
 to
 adopt
 this


technology.
 But
 the
 time
 is
 now
 here.


This
 platform
 shift
 that
 happened


starting
 about
 10
 years
 ago
 starting
 in


consumers
 is
 now
 in
 the
 process
 of


happening
 across
 the
 world's
 industries.


Let
 me
 give
 you
 one
 statistic.
 I
 think


this
 is
 actually
 about
 the
 same
 time


that
 I
 met
 Jim.
 During
 that
 year
 2016,


the
 world's
 scientific
 supercomputers


was
 90%
 CPUs


and
 10%
 GPUs.


This
 year
 it's
 90%
 GPUs
 and
 10%
 CPUs.


The
 platform
 shift
 has
 happened.
 Now


that's
 in
 scientific
 computing.
 What


Synapsis
 does,
 what
 this
 industry
 does


with
 engineering
 is
 founded
 on
 science,


founded
 on
 physics.
 And
 so
 principled


physics,
 we're
 in
 the
 process
 of
 making


a
 shift
 in
 this
 industry.
 Now
 this
 is


one
 of the
 most
 computing
 intensive


industries
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 now
 during


this
 transition,
 we're
 now
 doing
 the


platform
 shift
 for
 this
 entire
 industry


and
 elevating
 it
 with
 AI.
 We're
 going
 to


expand
 the
 market
 really
 tremendously


for
 this
 industry.
 It's
 really
 exciting


time.


>> Okay,
 so
 let
 me
 let
 me
 just
 follow
 up
 on


that,
 gentlemen,
 because


>> All
 right,
 we'll
 finish
 up
 with
 that
 in


a
 bit.
 But
 you
 got
 Jensen
 kind
 of
 making


the
 same
 case
 that
 he's
 been
 continuing


to
 make
 for
 a
 while.
 And
 this
 new


partnership
 with
 Synopsis
 is
 another
 one


in
 the
 string
 of
 partnerships
 that
 they


have.
 Tesla
 right
 there
 goes
 red
 after


going
 green.
 Meta
 continues
 to
 go
 red.


Amcor
 was
 green
 for
 a
 second.
 That
 one


now
 went
 red.
 Um
 Nvidia
 goes
 green.


There
 you
 go.
 177.
 So
 Nvidia
 took
 some


of
 Tesla's
 green.
 Bitcoin
 as
 well
 trying


to
 go
 green.
 Amazon
 staying
 green.


Amazon.
 Nvidia.
 The
 only
 green
 names
 I


see
 in
 the
 Mag
 7.
 Rivian's
 up
 about
 1%.


AMD,
 did
 we
 go
 green?
 AMD,
 wow,
 217.
 AMD


took
 a
 nasty
 fall
 last
 week
 or
 two
 weeks


ago
 from
 260
 to
 195.


Back
 up
 to
 almost
 220


is
 is
 nice
 to
 see.
 Yes,
 June
 is
 right.


Synopsis
 works
 heavily
 with
 Broadcom.


That
 is
 absolutely
 correct.
 Broadcom


right
 there
 still
 down
 3.7.
 I
 think


Broadcom
 is
 just
 chilling
 off
 a
 little


But
 I
 mean
 it
 had
 a
 a
 major
 week
 after


the
 Google
 TPU
 stuff.
 Broadcom's
 still


up
 67%


compared
 to
 Nvidia
 which
 is
 I
 think
 less


than
 30%
 for
 the
 year.
 Nvidia
 year
 to


date
 yeah
 28%.


So
 you
 got
 Broadcom
 heavily
 heavily


outperforming


um
 Nvidia.
 Google
 right
 there
 is
 that's


down
 1.3.
 S&P
 still
 down
 half
 a
 percent.


Micron's
 down
 1.5.
 New
 bankank
 at
 1742.


Abocrombi
 that's
 up
 2.4.
 Open
 Doors
 is


down
 4%.
 Then
 apploven


that's
 down
 2.7%
 as
 well.
 PMI,
 I
 think


we've
 got
 that.
 We
 had
 some
 ugly
 PMI


last
 week,
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 bad
 news
 was


good
 news.
 Today
 we
 have


global
 manufacturing
 PMI
 52.2
 versus


51.9.


That's
 a
 beat.


Not
 a
 big
 beat,
 but
 that
 is
 a
 beat.
 So


that
 potentially
 could
 give
 us
 a
 little


bit
 of
 green
 on
 the
 S&P.
 Yeah,
 doing
 it


a
 little.
 There's
 your
 green
 candle


right
 there.
 Still
 down
 on
 the
 day.
 So


PMI
 is
 relatively
 strong.
 Again,
 we're


going to
 get
 a
 lot
 more
 macro
 data
 over


the
 coming
 weeks.
 We'll
 get
 ISM


manufacturing
 PMI
 in
 about
 15
 minutes
 as


well.
 Uh
 actually
 over
 the
 coming
 days


because
 now
 the
 government's
 not
 shut


down.
 So,
 jobless
 claims,
 jolts
 data,


all
 that
 stuff.


All
 that
 stuff
 we
 should
 be
 getting


soon.
 S&P
 680,
 look
 at
 that.
 Closed
 at


683
 on
 Wednesday.
 Microsoft
 still
 down


1%.
 Tesla
 427
 and
 the
 BMR
 down
 7.
 I


think
 the
 markets
 kind
 of
 had
 to
 open
 up


red
 in
 the
 morning
 simply
 because
 the


crypto
 selloff
 was
 so
 large
 it
 started


affecting
 equities.
 If
 that
 reverses


because
 when
 futures
 went
 red
 yesterday,


I
 mean,
 no
 one
 had
 a
 headline.
 There
 was


nothing
 you
 could
 point
 to
 outside
 of


just
 crypto.
 And
 it's
 like,
 okay,
 so


crypto's
 down,
 so
 futures
 are
 down.
 But


if
 the
 market
 is
 either
 going
 to
 reverse


the
 crypto
 selloff
 or
 at least
 stabilize


the
 crypto
 selloff,


equities
 didn't
 have
 a
 reason
 last
 night


to
 necessarily
 get
 hit
 like
 they
 did.


Nvidia
 up
 almost
 1%
 right
 there.
 17820


as
 that
 continues
 to
 go
 green.
 Amit,
 are


you
 still
 bearish
 on
 open?
 I
 think
 Cass


is
 going to
 be
 Karp
 2.0.
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of


respect
 for
 Cass.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 he's


going
 to
 be
 Alex
 Karp
 2.0.
 Um,
 just
 my


personal
 opinion.
 I
 I
 I
 think
 there
 are


some
 fundamental
 differences
 between


Karp
 and
 Cass.
 Uh,
 and
 number
 two
 is


just
 I
 I
 just
 don't
 understand
 the


business
 model
 still.
 And
 I
 don't
 know,


dude.
 Like
 I
 I
 I
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


they
 need
 to
 get
 a
 margin
 on
 the
 homes


they're
 selling.
 And
 nothing
 over
 the


past
 six
 months
 of
 the
 stock
 going
 from


50
 cents
 to
 $7.
 I've
 not
 heard
 a
 single


piece
 of
 analysis
 on
 how
 they're
 going


to
 increase
 their
 spread.
 And
 so
 that


that's
 what
 still
 scares
 me
 about.
 I
 I


just
 want
 to
 take
 the
 risk.
 Forget
 even


being
 bearish.
 I'm
 not
 taking
 with
 with


Nvidia
 trading
 at
 25
 times
 earnings.
 I'm


not
 taking
 the
 risk
 on
 Open
 Door
 when


mortgage
 rates
 are
 not
 even
 below
 6%,


you
 know?
 So,
 it's
 now
 if
 you
 bought
 it


at
 a
 dollar,
 maybe
 you
 don't
 need
 to


sell
 because
 maybe
 it's
 a
 moonshot,
 but


I
 I
 still
 don't
 understand
 how
 they're


really
 going
 to
 make
 money
 and
 be


profitable
 long
 term.
 Bitcoin
 right


there
 86,000.
 Amazon
 234.
 That's
 the


high
 of
 day.
 Robin
 Hood
 recovering
 a


little
 bit
 to
 124.


And
 then
 you
 got
 Palunteer


at
 167.
 lot
 of
 chatter
 over
 the
 weekend


about
 GameStop.
 Uh
 GameStop
 right
 there


at
 38%.
 Apparently,
 Michael
 Bur
 was
 long


GameStop
 in
 2019
 and
 he's
 been
 tweeting


all
 these
 screenshots
 of
 like
 him


emailing
 the
 board
 of
 directors
 and
 you


just
 have
 a
 bunch
 of
 things
 of
 him


talking
 about
 the
 board
 and
 he
 emailed


Keith
 Gil
 and
 all
 this
 stuff
 and
 I
 don't


know
 if
 he's
 gearing
 up
 to
 go
 long


GameStop
 again.
 They
 do
 have
 billions
 in


Bitcoin
 and
 billions
 in
 cash,
 but
 it
 is


kind
 of
 weird
 for
 him
 to
 be
 bringing
 up


his
 August
 2019
 letter
 from
 his


management
 firm
 to
 uh
 GameStop
 board
 of


directors.


I
 think
 GameStop
 has
 a
 really


interesting
 opportunity
 in
 the
 trading


card
 space
 and
 they
 actually
 accelerated


revenues
 last
 quarter
 for
 that.
 I
 still


don't
 know
 if
 I
 would
 invest
 in
 them


just
 based
 on
 their
 cash
 pile
 and
 that


part
 of
 the
 business,
 but
 Bur
 tweeting


about
 GameStop
 is
 interesting.
 I
 mean,


maybe
 he
 goes
 long
 GameStop,
 which
 would


be
 kind
 of
 crazy
 to
 be
 short
 Nvidia
 and


pounder
 and
 be
 like,
 "Yep,
 I'm
 going


long
 GameStop,
 but
 maybe
 that's
 the


route
 he
 wants
 to
 go."
 Again,
 also
 over


the
 weekend
 on
 Tesla,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 he


would
 actually
 go
 after
 Tesla
 as


aggressively
 as
 he's
 going
 after
 Nvidia


because
 the
 Tesla
 cult
 is
 a
 bit


different
 to
 go
 after,
 but
 he
 does
 say


that
 Elon's
 Tesla
 is
 ridiculously


overvalued.


And
 he
 put
 out
 another
 substack


yesterday.
 Now
 his
 latest
 thing
 is
 that


his
 latest
 thing
 is
 uh
 Nvidia
 stockbased


compensation


is


like
 bearish.


He's
 just
 like
 he
 called
 it
 the
 tragic


algebra
 of
 stockbased
 comp.


I'm
 just
 like
 all
 right
 every
 day
 he
 has


a
 new
 talking
 point
 for
 why
 to
 bearish


Nvidia.
 But
 I
 don't
 know if
 the


stockbased
 comp
 is
 the
 best
 argument
 to


go
 after.
 Let's
 go
 back
 to
 Jensen
 and


finish
 up
 this
 interview
 with
 synopsis.


But
 right
 when
 it
 happens
 the
 size
 of


the
 industry
 is
 is
 incredibly
 large.
 As


you
 as
 you
 know
 the
 world's
 hundred


trillion
 dollar
 industry
 is
 largely


industrial
 and
 enterprise
 to
 enterprise.


These
 are
 enterprise
 you
 know
 serious


industrial
 enterprise
 applications
 that


are
 now
 being
 transformed
 by
 this


platform
 shift.
 But
 all right,
 am
 I


supposed
 to
 believe
 that
 what'll
 happen


at
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 Dell
 conference
 call


where
 Jeff
 Clark
 talked
 exactly
 about
 AI


factories
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 new


shift
 that
 we
 should
 be
 thinking
 about


how
 much
 uh
 GM
 is
 spending,
 how
 much
 BMW


is
 spending,
 how
 much
 Zemens
 is


spending,
 how
 much
 the
 big
 uh
 Korean


shipyards
 are
 spending.
 Is
 that
 what
 we


should
 now
 add
 to
 the
 mix
 and
 not
 just


perplexity
 against
 anthropic?


>> Exactly.
 If
 you
 think
 of
 all
 the


companies
 you
 just
 mentioned
 and
 the


percentage
 of
 R&D
 they
 invest
 in


automation
 in
 software
 etc
 is
 going
 to


become
 exponential
 driven
 by
 the


complexity
 and
 the
 sophistication
 of


what
 they're
 building.
 So
 if
 they
 were


spending
 2%
 of
 their
 revenue
 in
 R&D


dedicated
 to
 the
 software
 uh
 automation


and
 the
 technology
 is
 going
 to
 get


significantly
 higher
 due
 to
 complexity


in
 order
 for
 them
 to
 remain
 competitive


and
 delivering
 for
 the
 future.


>> All
 right.
 And
 then
 Jensen
 I
 know


>> here's
 a
 here's
 an
 easy
 way
 to
 think


about
 it.
 You
 know,
 one
 of
 the
 things


that's
 really
 important
 is
 almost
 all


industrial
 companies,
 companies
 that


make
 things
 like
 Nvidia,
 like
 GM,
 like


Boeing,
 these
 are
 companies
 that
 spend


probably
 hundreds
 of
 hundreds
 of


millions,
 maybe
 very
 low
 billions
 of


dollars
 in
 engineering
 software
 tools.


However,
 the
 amount
 that
 they
 spend
 in


prototyping
 all
 of
 those
 products
 is


easily
 10
 20
 times
 higher.
 It's
 the
 it's


absolutely
 the
 same
 case
 here
 at
 Nvidia.


We
 spent
 a
 few
 hundred
 million
 in
 EDA


tools
 and
 design
 tools.
 However,
 we


spend
 billions
 of
 dollars
 in
 prototyping


it.
 In
 the
 future,
 we're
 going
 to


prototype
 all
 of
 these
 products


digitally
 so
 that
 we
 don't
 waste
 any


money
 when
 we
 build
 it
 physically.
 In


order
 to
 build
 in
 order
 to
 prototype


things
 digitally,
 simulated
 inside
 a


digital
 twin.
 This
 is
 all
 the
 things


I've
 been
 talking
 to
 you
 about.
 All
 of
 a


sudden,
 the
 market
 opportunity
 increases


by
 a
 factor
 of
 10
 100.


>> Okay.
 So
 last
 question,
 right
 now
 we


spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 talking
 about
 Google


and
 what
 they're
 doing
 uh
 with
 their
 own


their
 their
 own
 TPU
 and
 we
 talk
 about


whether
 Metal
 will
 do
 it,
 but
 one
 thing


that
 you
 taught
 me
 was
 you
 like
 to
 think


20
 years
 forward
 and
 then
 backward.
 I


I'm
 thinking
 about
 Vera
 Rubin.
 I
 had
 to


go
 read
 that
 Richard
 Feman
 book
 because


you
 mentioned
 he's
 a
 pretty
 funny
 guy.


But
 I
 mean,
 when
 I
 look
 at
 the
 Beer


Rubin
 and
 the
 Fineman,
 am
 I
 going
 to
 be


saying,
 you
 know what,
 that
 was
 a
 great


thing
 those
 other
 guys
 had
 during
 that


nine-month
 window
 that
 Jensen
 allowed


him
 to
 have.


>> You
 know,
 listen,
 we've
 been
 uh
 we've


been
 competing
 with
 AS6
 now
 for
 quite
 a


long
 time,
 and
 Google
 has
 AS6
 for
 a
 long


time.
 Nvidia's
 Nvidia
 and
 they
 did
 a


great
 job
 as
 you
 know,
 and
 I've
 always


been
 complimentary.


>> Always.


>> What
 NVIDIA
 does
 is
 much
 more
 versatile.


Our
 technology
 is
 much
 more
 funible.


Notice
 the
 announcement
 today.


Accelerating
 synopsis
 design
 tools,
 the


EDA,
 the
 SDA,
 the
 CAE
 tools
 requires
 a


computer
 architecture
 like
 CUDA.
 It's


not
 available
 for
 AS6.
 And
 so
 NVIDIA
 can


address
 markets
 that
 are
 much
 much


broader,
 not
 just
 chatbots.
 We
 are
 also


everywhere.
 We're
 in
 every
 cloud.
 We're


in
 every
 single
 OEM.
 We're
 on
 prem
 and


we're
 also
 at
 the
 edge.
 And
 so
 the


NVIDIA
 opportunity
 is
 much
 much
 larger.


And
 you're
 now
 seeing
 a
 real
 tangible


experience
 example
 of
 an
 opportunity


that
 we
 could
 do
 with
 our
 platform
 that


nobody
 else
 can.
 And
 so
 this
 is
 a
 very


big
 opportunity
 for
 us,


>> huge
 opportunity
 to
 reinvent
 the
 EDA


industry,
 the
 design
 and
 engineering


industry
 for
 Synopsis
 and
 the
 rest
 of


the
 industry
 and
 a
 growth
 opportunity


for
 us
 because
 this
 is
 so


computationally
 intensive.


>> I
 was
 just
 all right.
 That's
 how
 Jensen


answered
 the
 Google
 question.
 And
 this


was
 his
 first
 public
 response
 to
 what's


been
 going
 on
 with
 Google.
 As
 Julie
 says


right
 there,
 Jensen
 never
 trashtalking,


always
 pretty
 respectful,
 nice.
 He


understands
 how
 to
 handle
 things
 very


diplomatically.
 And
 uh
 I
 think
 his


response
 is
 is
 pretty
 reasonable
 right


there.
 The
 the
 sort
 of
 precursor
 to
 his


response
 was
 the
 explanation
 he
 gave


around
 the
 TAM
 of
 digital
 simulations
 on


prototyping.
 That
 that's
 an
 you
 know


that's
 something
 he
 talked
 about
 on
 the


earnings
 call,
 but
 I
 haven't
 thought


about
 it
 too
 much.
 These
 companies
 that


are
 in
 the
 real
 world
 creating
 physical


products
 spend
 billions
 of
 dollars
 on


prototyping
 and
 the
 data
 required
 to
 be


able
 to
 create
 those
 prototypes.
 if
 you


could
 synthetically
 create
 those
 or
 at


least
 train
 on
 that
 synthetic
 data
 via


the
 Omniverse
 and
 Cosmos
 platform
 which


is
 what
 they're
 helping
 Synopsis
 do
 in


terms
 of
 designing
 that
 uh
 from
 a
 CUDA


architecture
 perspective
 which
 again


Jensen
 goes
 you
 know
 pretty
 deep
 every


single
 quarter
 speaking
 about
 why
 CUDA


is
 the
 developer
 application
 of
 choice


across
 every
 single
 OEM
 every
 single


on-prem
 or
 cloud
 computing
 module
 I
 mean


that
 is
 a
 moat
 right
 like
 that
 is
 a


legitimate
 moat
 outside
 of
 just
 their


their
 monopoly
 on
 on
 the
 hardware
 that


you
 know
 is
 getting
 chipped
 away
 as
 you


have
 these
 AS6
 come
 out
 but
 those
 AS6


don't
 have
 that
 CUDA
 infrastructure
 that


actually
 integrates
 the
 ecosystem
 in
 one


place
 I
 mean
 to
 get
 on
 Google
 TPUs
 from


my
 understanding
 you
 have
 to
 be
 using


Google
 cloud
 and
 that
 might
 not
 be


suitable
 to
 every
 single
 customer
 in
 the


world
 but
 then
 again
 that's
 the


characteristic
 of
 an
 ASIC
 which
 is
 why


Jensen
 has
 been
 so
 bullish
 on
 the
 sort


of
 GPU
 versus
 the
 variation
 of
 the
 GPU


like
 a
 TPU
 or
 any
 other
 type
 of


variation
 so
 I
 think
 it
 makes
 a
 lot
 of


sense
 what
 he's
 saying
 right
 there


there's
 a
 legit
 partnership
 with


Synopsis
 today
 to
 kind
 of
 be
 emblematic


of
 that
 uh
 manifestation
 of
 why
 CUDA
 is


so
 important.
 But
 more
 importantly,
 once


again,
 Jensen
 is
 taking
 an
 equity
 stake


in
 another
 company
 that
 he
 thinks
 is
 not


only
 going
 to
 thrive
 off
 buying
 his


product,
 but
 is
 going
 to
 win
 in
 the


broader
 AI
 sector.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 story


10
 years
 from
 now
 is
 going
 to
 be
 Nvidia


invested
 in
 a
 ton
 of
 companies
 that
 just


didn't
 end
 up
 working
 because
 they
 had


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 their
 cash
 or
 Nvidia


is
 one
 of
 the
 ultimate
 VC
 firms
 because


they
 have
 an
 equity
 stake
 in
 every


single
 company
 that
 is
 relevant
 in
 the


age
 of
 AI
 whether
 it's
 OpenAI
 Anthropic


maybe
 Synopsis


and
 maybe
 that's
 how
 this
 ends
 up


playing
 out.
 Ethereum
 right
 there
 2800


BMR
 still
 down
 on
 the
 day
 was
 down
 10%


now
 it's
 down
 7.5.
 S&P
 trying
 to
 break


green
 right
 here.
 681,
 a
 dollar
 away


from
 potentially
 going
 green.
 We
 did
 get


PMI.
 It
 was
 a
 beat
 52.9
 versus
 51.9.


We're
 going
 to
 get
 ISM
 in
 about
 3


minutes.
 And
 that'll
 potentially
 have
 an


impact
 on
 the
 market
 as
 well.
 But
 you


can
 tell
 from
 even
 Jensen's
 response,


he's
 been
 thinking
 about
 this
 Google


thing
 for
 a
 while
 and
 he
 gave
 the
 same


response
 that
 he's
 given
 many
 other


times.
 He's
 been
 asked
 about
 custom
 AS6.


Nvidia
 has
 simply
 a
 deeper
 understanding


of
 the
 industry
 and
 they
 have
 a
 deeper


moat
 in
 the
 industry.
 Not
 to
 say
 Google


can't
 sell
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 TPUs,
 just


means
 Nvidia
 is
 probably
 going
 to


continue
 selling
 a
 ton
 of
 their
 GPUs
 as


well.
 17826
 that's
 up
 71%.
 The
 other


thing
 that's
 really
 important
 as
 well
 is


that,
 you
 know,
 it's
 not
 just


anthropical
 perplexity
 that
 are
 buying


these
 GPUs.
 When
 you
 have
 Omniverse


coming
 into
 the
 picture
 and
 you
 have
 all


this
 synthetic
 data,
 they've
 announced


multiple
 partnerships
 with
 tons
 of
 other


companies.
 GM
 is
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


ones.
 Like
 those
 are
 companies
 that
 have


deeper
 pockets
 than
 Perplexity
 Anthropic


and
 that
 really
 need
 to
 spend
 to
 be
 able


to
 train
 their
 own
 platforms
 to
 actually


get
 physical
 prototypes
 into
 the
 real


world,
 not
 just
 as
 Jensen
 said,
 train
 a


chatbot
 to
 be
 better.
 And
 so
 it
 does


feel
 like
 that
 TAM
 is
 is
 only
 getting


larger
 and
 larger.
 And
 you
 know
 that


should
 sustain
 the
 earnings
 growth
 for


Nvidia.
 And
 if
 you
 think
 it
 sustains
 the


earnings
 growth,
 then
 Nvidia's
 cheap.


Nvidia
 becomes
 one
 of
 the
 cheaper
 Mac


Evans.
 Tesla
 right
 there
 at
 429.
 That


one
 trying
 to
 go
 green
 as
 well.
 Speaking


of
 uh
 the
 consumer
 and
 kind
 of
 this
 idea


that
 we
 were
 discussing
 earlier
 on
 in


the
 show,
 we
 saw
 that
 Toby
 Luke,
 the
 CEO


of
 Shopify,
 said
 that
 Black
 Friday
 sales


were
 up
 25%
 year-over-year,
 which
 is


quite
 incredible.
 Take
 a
 look
 at
 this


stat.
 Buy
 now
 pay
 later
 usage
 surged
 on


Black
 Friday,
 9%
 overall.
 It
 was
 higher.


41%
 of
 shoppers
 aed
 16
 to
 24
 use
 BNPL.


Younger
 millennials
 increased
 their


usage
 by
 an
 astonishing
 87%.
 Clara,
 by


the
 way,
 said
 the
 same
 thing,
 which
 is
 a


buy
 now
 pay
 later
 company.
 They
 said,


"We
 saw
 a
 45%
 year-over-year
 increase
 in


sales
 from
 November
 1st
 through
 Black


Friday."
 Um,
 and
 their
 data
 is
 based
 on


online
 and
 inapp
 activity.
 The
 company


serves
 114
 million
 users
 and
 850,000


retailers
 globally.
 Now,
 again,
 you
 can


interpret
 this
 data
 as
 bearish
 if
 you


think
 that
 Black
 Friday
 or
 that
 buy
 now


pay
 later
 on
 Black
 Friday
 is
 um
 the


consumer
 saying
 that
 we
 don't
 have
 the


money
 to
 pay
 and
 so
 we
 need
 to
 take
 out


these
 BNPL
 loans.
 That's
 one
 point.
 But


on
 the
 other
 hand,
 the
 consumer
 is


spending,
 which
 is
 what
 I
 think,
 you


know,
 the
 job
 market
 has
 been
 trying
 to


or
 I
 the
 the the
 the
 Fed
 futures


probabilities
 are
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


is
 the
 labor
 market
 having
 that
 much
 of


an
 impact
 on
 the
 ability
 for
 consumers


to
 spend
 because
 if
 it's
 not,
 then
 maybe


it's
 not
 as
 bad.
 Now,
 if
 the
 consumer
 is


spending
 with
 money
 they
 don't
 have,
 you


know,
 it
 could
 be
 that
 bad,
 but
 data


will
 tell
 exactly
 how
 delinquent
 those


loans
 potentially
 become.
 Meta
 right


there
 at
 644,
 that's
 down
 half
 a


percent.
 Intel
 down
 2%.
 And
 then
 Rivian


3%
 on
 the
 day


as
 that
 one
 gets
 green.
 Someone
 just


bought
 200
 grand
 of
 Rivian
 $18
 calls
 for


December
 19th.
 I'm
 seeing
 on
 the
 option


flow
 right
 there.
 So
 you
 got
 Rivian


going
 green.
 Yes,
 quantitative


tightening
 should
 be
 ending
 today.
 If


I'm
 not
 wrong
 for
 whoever
 said
 that
 in


the
 chat,
 I
 believe
 you
 were
 correct
 on


that.
 Today
 should
 be
 the
 day,
 December


1st.
 Yeah,
 December
 1st.
 The
 end
 of
 QT's


effective
 December
 1st.
 the
 Fed
 will


stop
 letting
 its
 balance
 sheet
 shrink,


which
 is
 kind
 of
 ironic
 that
 Bitcoin
 is


down
 6,000
 bucks
 on
 a
 day
 like
 today.


But
 yes,
 you
 are
 correct.
 December
 1st,


which
 is
 today,
 will
 be
 the
 end
 of
 QT.


Hopefully,
 we
 get
 that
 rate
 cut
 and


that's
 your
 monetary
 policy
 to
 signal


potentially
 a
 more
 bullish


Fed
 going
 into
 2026.


Chad
 is
 going
 to
 BNPL
 some
 GPUs.
 Isn't


that
 what
 every
 company
 is
 low-key


doing?
 like,
 "Yeah,
 we'll,
 you
 know,


give
 it
 to
 us
 now.
 We'll
 we'll
 buy
 it


later.
 We'll
 pay
 for
 it
 later."
 You


know,
 we
 don't
 need
 to
 pay
 right
 now,


but
 if
 you
 can
 give
 us
 a
 little bit
 of


that
 GPU,
 Jensen,
 that
 would
 be
 that


would
 be
 nice.
 Nvidia
 right
 there,
 178.


All right.
 ISMP


PMI.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 got
 that.
 Should
 be


getting
 it
 any
 second.


58.5
 versus
 59.5.
 That's
 a
 miss.


Wait,
 no.
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 manufacturing


prices.
 Sorry.
 48.2
 versus
 48.6.
 Still
 a


miss.
 Uh,
 very
 slight
 miss.
 Better
 than


the
 prices
 miss,
 which
 came
 in
 at
 58.5


versus
 59.5.
 Employment
 at
 44
 versus
 47.


That's
 a
 miss.
 That's
 a
 big
 one.
 That's


a
 big
 one.
 New
 orders
 47.4
 versus
 49.7.


That's
 also
 a
 pretty
 big
 miss.


Two
 to
 three
 points
 on
 these
 PMI


indices.
 uh
 definitely
 shouldn't
 be


ignored.


Um
 manufacturing
 48.2
 versus
 48.6.


Employment,
 new
 orders,
 and
 prices,
 all


three
 missed.


Okay,
 let's
 see
 how
 the
 market
 likes
 it


or
 if
 the
 market
 hates
 it.
 Yeah,


Nvidia's
 going
 red.
 S&P,
 there's
 your


red
 candle.
 We'll
 see
 if
 the
 market


really
 hates
 it
 or
 if
 they
 can
 move
 on


from
 it.
 Bit
 mine
 continuing
 to
 go
 red.


AMD
 going
 red.
 SoFi,
 there's
 your
 red


candle.
 Nebius,
 which
 is
 actually
 trying


to
 recover,
 but
 that
 one
 got
 a
 red


candle.


I
 mean,
 that's
 not
 that
 bad,
 but
 it


definitely
 is
 a
 two
 to
 three
 point
 miss.


Let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 find
 out


how
 low
 that
 is
 historically.


Um,
 let's
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here
 and


see


some
 coverage
 on
 ISM


>> November.
 These
 are
 fresh
 numbers.
 48.2.


That's
 definitely
 on
 the
 light
 side.


That'll
 be
 the
 lightest
 since
 July.
 If


we
 look
 at
 prices
 paid,
 58.5,
 higher


than
 expected.
 And
 in
 this
 series,


prices
 paid
 higher
 is
 not
 necessarily


better.
 58.5
 will
 be
 the
 hottest
 prices


paid
 going
 back
 to
 September
 of
 this


year.
 And
 if
 we
 look
 at
 new
 orders
 of


>> that
 goes
 back
 to
 the
 Fed's
 argument


about
 inflation
 might
 be
 ramping
 up
 a


bit.


>> Very
 big
 disappointment
 here.
 47.4.


47.4
 four,
 weakest
 since
 July.
 And


finally,
 on
 the
 employment
 front,
 44.0,


another
 big
 miss
 following
 a
 46.
 44.0


would
 be
 the
 lightest
 read
 since
 August.


And


>> so,
 lowest
 read
 since
 July
 and
 August.


Highest
 read
 on
 prices
 since
 September.


That's
 what
 you
 have
 for
 ISMP
 PMI.


>> Sequentially,
 well,
 all
 the
 important


numbers
 are
 sequentially
 lower.
 The
 only


one
 sequentially
 higher
 is
 prices
 paid.


As
 I
 pointed
 out,
 we
 rather
 have
 that


moving
 lower.
 Interest
 rates
 across
 the


globe
 have
 some
 upward
 pressure.
 We
 see


two-year
 hovering
 at
 352
 in
 the
 US.


That's
 up
 three
 basis
 points.
 The


10-year
 after
 it
 surpassed
 the
 recent


ceiling
 around
 4045
 on
 the
 yield


perspective
 jumped
 up
 to
 409,
 hovering


at
 408,
 up
 six
 basis
 points.


>> Tenure
 was
 down
 below
 four
 on
 Wednesday.


It
 probably
 was
 just
 because
 low
 volume


for
 Thanksgiving,
 but
 it
 was
 nice
 to
 see


this
 thing
 actually
 go
 below
 four.
 Not


that
 much
 above
 four,
 but
 you
 do
 have


4.083.
 All
 right,
 so
 ISM
 not
 the
 best.


We'll
 see
 if
 the
 market
 cares
 that
 much


about
 it.
 These
 things
 tend
 to
 get


priced
 in
 pretty
 quickly.
 Nvidia
 already


getting
 a
 bit
 of
 recovery.
 Same
 thing


with
 the
 S&P,
 but
 you
 are
 seeing
 a
 bit


of
 weakening
 right
 there.
 and
 and
 and


you
 know
 the
 prices
 going
 up
 is
 not


necessarily
 good
 for
 cutting
 rates
 but


the
 contraction
 since
 July
 and
 August
 or


at least
 the
 numbers
 being
 as
 uh
 bad
 as


those
 four
 as
 four
 months
 ago
 that
 is


your
 argument
 for
 a
 rate
 cut.
 So
 prices


going
 up
 not
 the
 best
 but
 contraction


continuing
 to
 occur
 means
 probably
 more


easing
 is
 needed.
 87.6%
 chance
 on
 those


rate
 cuts.
 Silver's
 at
 an
 all-time
 high.


Congrats
 to
 anyone
 who
 is
 deep
 into


silver.
 Um,
 I
 was
 actually
 speaking
 to


my
 uncle
 over
 the
 weekend.
 It
 was
 his


birthday


and
 he's
 been
 loving
 the
 move
 in
 silver


because


he's
 been
 long
 silver
 for
 a
 while.
 Gold,


by
 the
 way,
 as
 well
 4,200
 back
 to
 42


and
 then
 silver
 57.


Silver's,
 you
 know,
 highest
 ever.
 It's


basically
 been
 a
 10-year
 breakout.
 last


time
 it
 even
 got
 close
 to
 these
 levels


was
 uh
 back
 in
 2011.


And
 so
 you're
 seeing
 a
 real
 breakout


right
 there.
 Now
 look,
 the
 the
 general


argument
 around
 commodities
 going
 up


like
 this
 is
 it's
 bearish
 for
 equities


because
 it's
 like
 the
 market's
 trying
 to


tell
 you
 that
 we
 think
 something
 bad


might
 happen.
 Then
 again,
 you
 might
 also


just
 have
 a
 level
 of
 debasement
 trade
 de


the
 debasement
 trade
 taking
 place
 which


is
 leading
 to
 people
 leaving
 treasuries


and
 going
 into
 commodities.
 You
 could


have
 an
 argument
 that
 maybe
 commodities


are
 overvalued
 and
 there's
 just
 hype
 and


euphoria
 coming
 into
 them.
 So
 like
 maybe


maybe
 they're
 not
 telling
 you
 that


equities
 are
 bad.
 Maybe
 the
 central
 bank


purchasing
 of
 gold
 is
 hyping
 up
 all
 the


other
 commodities.
 Uh
 and
 then
 the
 other


argument
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 Evercore
 said
 a


few
 weeks
 ago
 in
 their
 note
 to
 clients,


which
 is
 that
 we
 might
 be
 setting
 up
 for


an
 everything
 rally.
 and
 that
 everything


rally
 in
 2026
 could
 be
 based
 on
 a
 very


very
 cooperative
 Fed,
 really
 good
 AI


earnings,
 and
 the
 debasement
 trade.


Essentially,
 the
 dollar
 continuing
 to


weaken
 and
 people
 wanting
 to
 get
 out
 of


cash,
 which
 means
 they're
 going
 to
 come


into
 anything
 they
 can
 find,
 whether


that's
 real
 estate,
 commodities,


or
 or
 equities.


Now,
 that
 could
 go
 the
 opposite
 next


year
 as
 well,
 but
 that
 could
 be
 one


argument.
 By
 the
 way,
 money
 market
 funds


last
 week
 increased
 by
 45
 billion.


Nothing
 too
 crazy,
 but
 still
 7.57


trillion


is
 on
 the
 sidelines.


Um,
 so
 silver
 continuing
 to
 make
 its


move
 as
 that
 one
 goes
 higher.
 I
 don't


think
 is
 is
 JPL
 speaking
 today?
 I
 don't


think
 he's
 allowed
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 Fed


is
 allowed
 to
 speak
 anymore.
 Last
 week


was
 the
 final
 week.
 Yeah,
 because
 their


meetings
 in
 on
 the
 10th.
 So,
 uh,
 I
 don't


think
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 getting
 any
 Fed


talk


over
 the
 next
 week.
 The
 Fed
 did
 a
 lot
 of


talking
 last
 week.
 By
 the
 way,
 Nvidia


trying
 to
 go
 for
 180,
 178.8
 right
 there,


up
 1%.


So,
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 should
 get
 too
 much


JPAL
 conversation.


But
 if
 he
 does
 talk,
 then,


you
 know,
 he's
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 say


anything
 that
 would
 be
 specific
 about


Fed
 policy
 at
 this
 point.


8
 p.m.
 Where
 is
 he
 talking
 at?
 8
 p.m.


When
 does
 he
 is
 he
 doing
 like
 an


interview?
 When
 does
 J
 ever
 spoke
 at
 8


p.m.?
 Jerome
 Pal
 8:00
 p.m.


Uh,
 Hoover
 Institution
 in
 Stanford,


California.
 Okay.
 So,
 technically
 it's
 5


p.m.


Yeah.
 I
 don't
 I
 mean
 I
 don't
 know
 if


he's
 going
 to
 be
 speaking


too
 deeply
 about
 Fed
 policy
 now
 that


it's
 a
 blackout
 week.
 But


okay,
 Stanford
 speech.
 Okay.
 But
 guys,


that's
 not
 going to
 be
 that
 spe
 I
 mean,


he's
 going
 to
 be
 talking
 like
 it's
 one


of
 those
 like,
 you
 know,
 when
 you're
 in


that
 world,
 you
 have
 to
 give
 these


speeches.
 Like
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 he's


going
 to
 give
 us
 any
 juicy
 quotes
 that


the
 market's
 going
 to
 react.
 I
 mean,
 the


market's
 probably
 going
 to
 be
 listening.


Nvidia
 right
 there,
 179,


but
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 he's
 going
 to
 say


anything
 that
 is
 really
 worth
 the
 market


caring
 about.


Yeah,
 I
 doubt
 he's
 going to
 be
 talking


about
 policy.
 He
 can't.
 It's
 a
 blackout


week
 for
 the
 Fed.
 There's
 no
 way
 he's


going to
 be
 able
 to
 talk
 about
 policy.


They
 probably
 won't
 even
 try
 to
 ask
 him


questions
 about
 policy
 because
 they


probably
 know
 he
 can't
 speak
 about
 that


stuff.
 Amazon

 there

 But
 I


I'll
 keep
 an
 eye
 on
 it
 and
 I'll
 cover
 if


we
 see
 what
 he
 says.
 Rumor
 says
 he's


resigning.
 I
 really
 doubt
 he's


resigning.
 If
 he
 was
 resigning,
 he


wouldn't
 go
 to
 Stanford
 and
 be
 like,


"Hey,
 I'm
 announcing
 my
 res."
 Like,


also,
 JPAL's
 too
 petty
 to
 resign,
 dude.


Jal,
 we
 know
 Jal's
 petty.
 He's
 not
 going


to
 give
 Trump
 the
 uh
 the
 satisfaction
 of


resigning.


Like,
 that
 would
 be
 too
 good
 for
 Trump.


Too
 good.
 like
 you
 need
 Trump
 already


has
 a
 dove
 with
 asset
 and
 uh
 Moran
 he


got
 a
 he
 got
 a
 Fed
 appointment
 for
 a


governor
 a
 couple
 months
 ago.
 JPAL


leaving
 would
 just
 be
 I
 wonder
 what
 the


markets
 would
 do.
 I
 wonder
 if
 the


markets
 would
 pump
 immediately
 if
 that


happens
 or
 if
 they
 would
 be
 a
 little


worried.

JPAL
 to

 for

 and


retire

 p.m.
 Eastern.


Do
 you
 guys
 remember
 this
 year
 we
 saw
 a


picture
 of
 Trump
 and
 JPAL
 wearing


construction
 hats?


Like
 Like
 did
 we
 all
 forget
 that


happened?
 I
 saw
 this
 the
 other
 day
 just


randomly
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh
 yeah,
 that


did
 happen."
 Like
 we
 have
 lived
 through


so
 many
 simulation
 moments
 over
 the
 past


year


and
 it's
 been
 quite
 incredible
 to


witness,
 but


it
 was
 a
 real
 thing
 and
 uh
 I
 guess
 we're


going
 to
 see
 kind
 of
 how
 the
 next
 six


months
 play
 out
 once
 JPA
 does
 have
 a


shadow
 fed.
 By
 the
 way,
 uh
 remember


Masasan
 from
 SoftBank
 selling
 his


Nvidia?
 He
 finally
 gave
 us
 a
 quote


today.
 Here's
 what
 he
 said.
 I
 didn't


want
 to
 sell
 a
 single
 share
 of
 Nvidia,


but
 I
 needed
 the
 money
 to
 invest
 in
 open


AI
 and
 other
 opportunities.
 When
 super


intelligence
 comes,
 at least
 10%
 of


global
 GDP
 will
 be
 replaced
 by
 AI
 and
 AI


robots.


So,
 you
 got
 Masasan
 saying,
 look,
 we


didn't
 want
 to
 sell
 our
 six
 billion


invid,
 but
 we
 kind
 of
 had
 to
 if
 we're


going
 to
 invest
 in
 other
 opportunities.


Basically,
 he's
 just
 thinking
 OpenAI
 is


going
 to
 perform
 better
 than
 Nvidia
 over


the
 next
 decade,
 which
 I
 mean,
 look,


there's
 an
 argument
 that's
 the
 case.


like
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's
 going


to
 be
 the
 case,
 but
 you
 can't
 blame
 him


for
 wanting
 to
 take
 their
 profits
 there.


But
 people
 that
 said
 he
 sold
 Nvidia


because
 he
 thinks
 Nvidia
 is
 done,
 it's


like
 well
 if
 he's
 investing
 in
 the


companies
 that
 are
 just
 going
 to
 be


buying
 more
 chips
 from
 Nvidia,


then
 maybe
 that's
 not
 the
 uh
 the


argument.


With
 QT
 ending
 today,
 will
 it
 solve


liquidity
 issues?
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 will


solve
 all
 the
 issues.
 I
 think
 it
 will


make
 it
 a
 lot
 easier
 for
 liquidity
 to


enter
 the
 system.
 It's
 not
 going
 to


happen
 overnight.
 But
 yes,
 with
 QT


ending
 today,
 I
 think
 that
 is
 very


bullish
 for
 risk
 on
 assets.
 I
 think


there's
 this
 weird
 leverage
 stuck
 in


crypto
 either
 from
 the
 yen
 carry
 trade


or
 either
 from
 people
 going
 max
 long
 25x


on
 their
 perpetual
 futures
 contracts.
 I


don't
 know
 why
 there's
 this
 much


leverage
 stuck
 in
 crypto,


but
 it
 seems
 like
 it's
 not
 even
 just
 a


liquidity
 thing
 around
 crypto.
 It
 seems


like
 it's
 this
 leverage
 if
 you
 believe


that
 part
 of
 the
 argument.
 So
 hopefully


quantitative
 tightening
 coming
 to
 an
 end


uh
 will
 help
 these
 crypto
 assets.
 Bit


mine
 right
 there

still.
 Rocket

 down

 on

 Where's
 Quantum


QBTS
 down
 3%
 on
 the
 day.
 OQ
 down
 3%.
 And


then
 Regetti
 that's
 also
 down
 4%.
 So
 a


lot
 of
 those
 high
 beta
 names
 still


getting
 hit.
 Oaklo
 down
 another
 2%.


Uh,
 Reddit

that's
 up
 2.74%.


Here's
 something
 I
 want
 to
 show


everybody.
 I
 read
 this
 over
 the
 weekend


and
 I
 couldn't
 believe
 this
 as
 well.


Going
 back
 to
 this
 conversation
 of
 an
 AI


bubble.
 So,
 apparently
 there's
 this
 guy


who
 runs
 a
 fund
 and
 I
 didn't
 know
 about


this
 until
 Skrey
 reposted
 one
 of
 his


letters
 that
 he
 sent
 out
 on
 November


28th.
 And
 this
 is
 how
 painful
 it
 is
 to


be
 a
 bear
 in
 the
 age
 of
 AI.
 And
 maybe


he's
 going
 to
 be
 right
 long
 term,
 but
 I


mean,
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 tough.
 So,
 just


imagine
 you
 invested
 in
 this
 guy
 and


this
 is
 the
 letter
 that
 you
 get
 from
 him


over
 Thanksgiving.
 For
 November
 2025,


the
 fund
 was
 down
 5%
 net
 of
 all
 fees
 and


expenses.
 By
 way
 of
 comparison,
 the
 S&P


500
 was
 up
 2%,
 the
 Russell
 was
 up
 1%.


Year-to-
 date,
 the
 fund
 is
 down
 26%


while
 the
 S&P
 500
 is
 up
 17%
 and
 the


Russell
 2000
 is
 up
 13.5%.
 Since


inception
 on
 2011,
 the
 fund
 is
 down
 8%


while
 the
 S&P
 500
 is
 up
 567%.


I
 know
 he
 had
 to
 like
 put
 that
 in
 the


letter,
 but
 my
 goodness
 would
 I
 try
 to


reward
 that
 in
 a
 more
 friendly
 way,
 even


though
 it's
 hard
 because
 it's
 numbers
 to


not
 say,
 "Hey,
 the
 fund
 you
 invested
 in


2011
 is
 down
 8%
 over
 the
 past
 10
 years.


If
 you
 just
 put
 your
 money
 in
 the
 S&P,


you
 would
 be
 up
 5x."
 Twothirds
 of
 the


way
 through
 November,
 we
 were
 up
 nearly


11%
 as
 it
 seemed
 the
 biggest
 bubble
 in


modern
 history
 was
 finally
 popping.
 Then


stocks
 roared
 back,
 whipsawing
 our


shorts
 badly.
 And
 here
 we
 are
 yet


another
 terrible
 month.
 Yet
 this
 is
 the


biggest
 bubble
 in
 modern
 history
 and
 we


remain
 positioned
 for
 it
 to
 pop
 via
 a


large
 S&P
 500
 short
 position
 and
 much


smaller
 short
 positions
 in
 other


companies
 including
 Tesla.
 Here's
 why
 I


called
 this
 the
 biggest
 bubble.
 Then
 he


puts
 out
 these
 PE
 ratios.


That
 said,
 we've
 only
 had
 one
 small


redemption
 all
 year
 and
 I
 sincerely
 hope


that
 during
 my
 performance
 debacle


you've
 all
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 on
 your


long
 positions.
 Uh
 meanwhile,
 I
 continue


to
 wave
 our
 management
 fee
 until
 I
 get


you
 back
 above
 high
 water.
 something
 I


did
 during
 a
 bad
 stretch
 several
 years


ago
 before
 setting
 a
 new
 high
 mark
 at


the
 end
 of
 2022.


So,
 this
 guy's
 name
 is
 Stanfill
 Capital,


and
 apparently
 he
 more
 he
 he
 manages


some
 large
 money
 uh
 enough
 for
 Skrey
 to


to
 tweet
 about
 him.
 Skrey
 is
 is
 pretty


active
 in
 that
 fund
 manager
 world,
 so
 he


knows
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 guys.
 And
 I
 was


reading
 that
 letter
 last
 night
 and
 I
 was


like,
 my
 goodness,
 having
 to
 tell
 your


investors
 that
 we
 almost
 made
 you
 money


in
 November
 when
 everything
 seemed
 like


it
 was
 going
 to
 pop
 because
 that's
 how


we're
 positioning
 to
 navigate
 the
 equity


markets.
 And
 then
 the
 markets
 whipsawed


back
 up
 and
 we
 ended
 up
 going
 down
 on


our
 short
 position.
 We
 didn't
 take


profits
 when
 we
 thought
 it
 was
 going
 to


pop
 because
 we
 thought
 it
 was
 going
 to


pop.
 And
 so
 why
 would
 you
 take
 profits


if
 the
 S&P
 is
 going
 to
 collapse
 another


15%.
 That
 didn't
 happen.
 The
 funds
 down


8%
 over
 the
 past
 15
 years


and
 you're
 down
 26%


when
 the
 S&P
 500
 already
 had
 a
 30%


decline.
 How
 are
 you
 down
 26%


after
 the
 S&P
 fell
 30%
 and
 then


recovered?
 I
 mean,
 it's
 quite
 incredible


the
 level
 of
 destruction
 you
 need
 to
 put


towards
 the
 portfolio
 or
 the
 level
 of


positions
 you
 need
 to
 have
 to
 to
 create


that
 destruction


in
 a
 market
 where,
 you
 know,
 we
 were


down
 a
 lot.
 I
 mean,
 he
 if
 he
 was
 net


short
 when
 the
 S&P
 fell
 30%,
 he
 should


have
 been
 up
 a
 lot
 and
 at
 least
 taken


some
 of
 those
 profits,
 but
 he
 probably


got
 greedy
 and
 thought
 the
 entire
 world


was
 going
 to
 collapse
 at
 4,800
 back
 in


April
 and
 then
 the
 whipsaw
 probably


ruined
 all
 the
 short
 positions.


So,
 it
 is
 quite
 incredible.
 But
 again,
 a


lot
 of
 bears
 have
 that
 same
 narrative.


Now,
 maybe
 that
 narrative
 is
 different


in
 2026,
 but
 so
 far
 the
 earnings
 growth


and
 the
 catalyst
 for
 the
 earnings
 have


not
 been,


you
 know,
 the
 best
 for
 for
 a
 lot
 of


these
 bears.
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 178
 that


continues
 to
 go
 green.
 He's
 the
 famous


Tesla
 short.
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 much


about
 this
 guy.
 I
 found
 out
 about
 him


yesterday
 because
 Greley
 tweeted
 about
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 I
 mean
 this
 guy
 definitely


said
 in
 his
 letter
 that
 he's
 once
 again


short
 Tesla,


but
 I
 guess
 some
 of
 the
 Tesla
 OGs
 might


know
 this
 guy
 more
 than
 me.
 Stanfill


Capital.
 He's
 got
 44,000
 followers.


I
 was
 just
 reading
 that
 letter
 and
 I
 was


like,
 dude,
 that
 is
 a
 tough
 tough
 letter


to


have
 to
 give
 to
 your
 investors.


But
 again,
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 investors


might
 want
 to
 put
 their
 money
 in
 a
 fund


that
 is
 net
 short,
 right?
 And
 get
 some


exposure
 to
 the
 to
 the
 bare
 side.
 So


there
 is
 a
 reason
 why
 he
 has
 raised
 that


capital.
 All right,
 let's
 get
 some


coverage
 on
 the
 consumer
 and
 Black


Friday.
 Here
 are
 some
 stats


and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> Percent
 from
 last
 year.
 E-commerce


sales,
 that's
 really
 where
 the
 strength


is.
 Up
 almost
 10
 and
 a
 half%.
 Is
 that
 as


good
 as
 last
 year?
 um
 not
 necessarily,


but
 it's
 still
 really
 strong.
 And
 if
 you


look
 at
 some
 of
 the
 categories
 that
 saw


growth,
 apparel
 sales,
 that's
 much


needed
 category
 for
 growth
 up
 5.7%
 and


jewelry
 sales
 up
 almost
 3%.
 Those
 stood


out.
 It
 jives
 with
 what
 we
 got
 from


Adobe,
 which
 showed
 even
 stronger


growth.
 They
 always
 track
 the
 the
 ecom


sales
 up
 9%
 from
 last
 year
 to
 a
 record


almost
 12
 billion
 spent
 online
 over
 the


holiday
 weekend.
 And
 guys,
 just
 because


my
 kids
 were
 here
 on,
 if
 you
 remember,


before
 the
 for
 the
 holiday
 on
 Friday
 and


and
 they
 said
 they
 each
 wanted
 jerseys,


so
 Fanatic
 sent
 in
 some
 of
 their
 data


from
 the
 weekend.
 They
 had
 a
 very
 strong


uh
 holiday
 shopping
 season.
 Sales
 on
 the


Fanatics
 app
 were
 up
 285%


on
 Black
 Friday
 from
 last
 year
 and
 the


highest
 that
 they've
 ever
 seen.
 So
 it's


not
 just


>> again
 this
 consu
 is
 everyone
 doing
 this


on
 credit
 cards
 or
 BNPL


fanatics,
 Adobe,
 Salesforce,
 Shopify.


These
 are
 record
 numbers
 for
 Black


Friday.
 I
 mean
 we'll
 get
 Amazon's
 um
 uh


data
 probably
 in
 a
 couple
 days.
 They


still
 have
 to
 calculate
 Cyber
 Monday,


which
 is
 today.
 I
 mean,
 put
 in
 the
 chat


if
 you
 bought
 anything
 on
 Black
 Friday


or
 you
 you
 spent
 any
 money,
 but
 my


goodness,
 this
 is
 like
 not
 necessarily


weak
 consumer
 behavior
 for
 all
 these


analytics
 to
 be
 up
 triple
 digits


year-over-year.


>> My
 kids,
 a
 lot
 of
 kids
 want
 jerseys.
 Um,


they
 had
 really
 strong
 performance,
 they


said,
 in
 the
 NFL
 Lululemon
 collection,


the
 NBA
 City
 edition,
 Dodgers
 World


Series
 champ
 merch,
 no
 surprise,
 um,
 and


the
 NHL
 alternate
 jersey
 launches
 as


well.
 So
 just
 some
 some
 good
 color
 on


one
 specific
 retailer
 which
 saw
 really


strong
 gains
 that
 I
 can
 relate
 to.


>> Certainly
 got
 ratified
 by
 at least
 last


week's
 action
 in
 some
 of
 these
 retail


names.
 Mike,


>> yes,
 they
 did
 um
 respond
 to
 the
 pullback


that
 we
 got
 right
 over
 the
 first
 three


months
 of
 November.
 Definitely
 a
 growth


scare.
 I
 think
 we
 rebuilt
 a
 little
 bit


of
 confidence
 in
 that
 part
 of
 the


economy
 with
 uh
 affirmation
 we're


probably
 going
 to
 get
 a
 gonna
 get
 a
 rate


cut.
 And
 the
 industry's
 been
 so
 good
 at


funneling
 retail
 activity
 into
 this


handful
 of
 days.
 I
 always
 want
 to
 make


sure
 the
 number
 is
 kind
 of
 you
 you
 look


at
 it
 over
 a
 broader
 window.
 Um
 it's


coincident,
 right?
 I
 mean
 we
 people
 have


jobs
 for
 the
 most
 part.
 It's
 less
 than


four
 and a
 half%
 unemployment
 and
 we're


kind
 of
 growing
 retail
 sales
 close
 to


nominal
 GDP
 growth.
 I
 don't
 think
 that's


a
 bad
 thing,
 but
 I
 also
 don't
 think
 it's


a
 matter
 of
 the
 consumer
 to
 the
 rescue.


It's
 much
 more
 just
 sort
 of
 pushes


against
 the
 idea
 that
 there's
 um
 that


you
 know
 there's
 sort
 of
 a
 a
 real
 stress


on
 the
 consumer
 more
 broadly.


>> Well,
 that's
 a
 big
 deal.
 Maybe
 the


consumer
 is
 not
 coming
 to
 the
 rescue,


but
 if
 there
 isn't
 as
 much
 real
 stress


on
 the
 consumer
 as
 we
 all
 thought,


there's
 another
 chart
 right
 here.


Holiday
 e-commerce
 has
 tripled
 over
 the


past
 decade,
 11.8
 billion
 on
 Black


Friday.


It
 really
 does
 make
 you
 think
 twice


about
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 the
 consumer.


Not
 saying
 the
 consumer
 is
 not


struggling,
 not
 saying
 that
 the
 labor


market
 is
 not
 amazing,
 but


I
 mean,
 this
 type
 of
 spending,
 I
 did
 not


expect
 given
 all
 the
 bearish
 stuff
 we


I've
 just
 not
 heard.
 I
 I
 did
 not
 expect


this
 type
 of
 spending
 because
 again,
 if


people
 don't
 have
 the
 money
 or
 the


disposable
 income,
 they're
 not
 going
 to


spend.
 And
 you're
 seeing
 uh
 pretty
 much


the
 opposite
 on
 this
 one.
 Here
 is
 RBC's


analyst
 about
 what
 she
 thinks
 is
 going


on
 with
 the
 consumer
 as
 well.


>> Of
 our
 forecast,
 our
 target
 on
 a


12-month
 forward
 basis
 is
 7750


um
 for
 about
 a
 14%
 gain
 versus
 that


Wednesday
 close
 before
 Thanksgiving.
 We


do
 think
 that
 you've
 got
 some
 short-term


stuff
 to
 work
 through.
 Maybe
 the
 5.1%


decline
 that
 we
 already
 did
 was
 enough.


Maybe
 there's
 still
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 to


wrangle
 out.
 We
 have
 a
 whole
 long
 list


of
 things
 we're
 watching
 at.
 But
 to
 be


honest,
 Mike,
 I'm
 trying
 to
 get
 away


from
 sort
 of
 this
 year-end,
 you
 know,


this
 is
 exactly
 what's
 going
 to
 happen


over
 the
 next
 few
 weeks
 and
 really


starting
 to
 turn
 our
 attention
 to
 a


longer
 term
 time
 frame.


>> So
 that
 longer
 term
 12-month
 time
 frame,


uh,
 you
 know,
 it
 probably
 would
 be


logical
 to
 say,
 look,
 the
 market
 um
 is


at
 least
 fully
 valued.
 um
 you
 know
 even


though
 people
 have
 said
 that
 they're
 a


little
 bit
 concerned
 equity
 exposures


are
 pretty
 high
 we
 sort
 of
 know
 what
 the


immediate
 Fed
 path
 is
 but
 we're
 not


quite
 sure
 uh
 beyond
 that.
 So
 what
 are


the
 elements
 that
 feed
 into
 you
 know
 a


pretty
 aggressive
 14%
 upside
 target?


>> So
 we
 have
 uh
 five
 different
 models
 that


we
 use
 and
 the
 7750
 is
 basically
 really


close
 to
 the
 median
 and
 the
 average.


We're
 kind
 of
 looking
 at
 both
 of
 those


stats.
 Um
 the
 mo
 the
 most
 constructive


one
 gets
 us
 all
 the
 way
 up
 to
 8,000.


That's
 some
 valuation
 and
 earnings
 work


we've
 done.
 The
 least
 constructive
 is


our
 economic
 test
 looking
 at
 GDP
 that


doesn't
 quite
 manage
 to
 cross
 the
 2%


year-over-year
 threshold
 at
 the
 end
 of


next
 year.
 That's
 more
 like
 a
 five
 to


six%
 type
 gain.
 That's
 the
 least


constructive.
 Now,
 the
 other
 three


models,
 it's
 really
 funny.
 They
 come
 out


to
 13,
 14,
 and
 15%
 returns.
 Um,
 one
 of


those
 is
 looking
 at
 the
 Fed,
 and
 when


you
 see
 the
 Fed
 cutting,
 but
 they're
 not


cutting
 too
 much,
 that's
 actually
 good


news.
 Stock
 market
 tends
 to
 be
 up,
 you


know,
 about
 13%
 if
 they're
 doing
 100


basis
 points
 or
 less
 in
 a
 12-month
 time


frame.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 our
 sentiment


model
 now,
 AI
 was
 really
 interesting.


So,
 I
 was
 working
 on
 Friday.
 I
 know
 most


of
 you
 guys
 were
 as
 well.
 Um,
 but
 we


actually
 saw
 the
 latest
 update
 from
 that


sentiment
 indicator
 and
 the
 4-week


average
 dropped
 down
 into
 the
 sweet


spot.
 It's
 now
 between
 minus1
 and
 minus2


standard
 deviations
 below
 the
 long-term


average.
 And
 typically,
 you
 know,
 it
 can


go
 lower.
 Frankly,
 it
 may
 go
 lower,
 but


on
 a
 12-month
 forward
 time
 frame,
 you're


typically
 up
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 about


15%.
 Our
 earnings
 yield
 gap
 model
 is
 the


14%
 that
 looks
 at
 stocks
 versus
 bonds


that
 uh
 the
 comparison
 of
 the
 earnings


yield
 versus
 the
 10-year
 yield.
 They're


very
 close.
 Um
 but
 it's
 enough
 to
 get


you
 kind
 of
 about
 a
 14%
 return


historically.


>> Does
 it
 concern
 you
 at
 all
 um
 to
 apply


that
 level
 of
 precision
 to
 the
 AI


survey?
 I
 only
 say
 that
 because
 other


measures
 are
 not
 quite
 as
 negative
 and


um
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 few
 hundred
 people.


It's
 kind
 of
 like
 an
 opt-in
 poll.
 And


you
 know,
 we
 had
 the
 same
 kind
 of
 gains


in
 2024
 when
 it
 was
 really
 net
 bullish


the
 whole
 year
 as
 we've
 had
 this
 year


when
 it
 was
 mostly
 skeptical.


>> So,
 you
 know,
 it's
 been
 a
 really
 good


indicator
 over
 time.
 We've
 got
 a
 really


long
 duration
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 time


series,
 but
 we
 don't
 believe
 in
 looking


at
 only
 one
 thing,
 right?
 I've
 never


been
 what
 I
 call
 sort
 of
 the
 magic
 model


strategist
 where,
 hey,
 here
 we're


putting
 this
 in
 and
 it's
 just
 this
 one


thing
 we
 look
 at.
 We
 want
 to
 look
 at
 the


preponderance
 of
 the
 evidence.
 Frankly,


that's
 why
 we
 also
 pay
 attention
 to
 the


medians
 um
 when
 we're
 doing,
 you
 know,


sort
 of
 the
 analysis
 of
 the
 different


models.
 Yeah.
 It
 is
 fascinating
 though


because
 AI
 also
 tracks
 the
 actual


allocations
 and
 those
 are
 up
 here
 and


the
 sentiment
 is
 down
 here.
 So,
 there
 is


a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 disconnect.


>> Sure.


>> What
 about
 Bitcoin?


>> Bitcoin.
 So,
 it's
 not
 something
 we're


really
 looking
 so
 much
 in
 terms
 of
 this


12-month
 forward
 forecast,
 but
 last
 week


on
 Monday,
 we
 actually
 made
 a
 long
 list


of
 all
 the
 things
 we're
 watching
 to
 kind


of
 gauge
 this
 current
 period
 of
 more


near-term
 stress.
 Bitcoin's
 at
 the
 top


of
 the
 list.
 I
 mean,
 there
 are
 a
 few


other
 things
 as
 well.
 Brethren
 has
 been


declining,
 but
 if
 you
 look
 over
 the
 past


few
 years,
 Bitcoin
 and
 S&P
 500
 have
 been


correlated,


>> but
 Bitcoin
 as
 a
 leader,


>> it's
 been
 it's
 been
 more
 coincident.
 And


so,
 the
 fact
 that
 we've
 seen
 Bitcoin


stumbling,
 you
 know,
 frankly,
 it's
 been


a
 little
 bit
 patchy
 since
 the
 summer.


We've
 kept
 thinking
 that
 this
 was
 going


to
 pretend
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 a
 draw
 down,
 you


know,
 of
 sort
 of
 the
 risk
 trade.


Frankly,
 we
 got
 5.1%.
 I'm,
 you
 know,
 I


wish
 it
 had
 been
 more.
 I'd
 feel,
 you


know,
 a
 lot
 better
 about
 the
 frost
 being


out
 in
 the
 short
 term,
 but
 we,
 you
 know,


we
 woke
 up
 to
 these
 headlines
 this


morning
 and
 it's,
 you
 know,
 telling
 us


maybe
 there's
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 to
 go


than
 the
 5.1%
 or
 maybe
 we
 retest
 some
 of


those
 lows,
 but
 that's
 a
 short-term


issue.


>> We
 keep


all
 right,
 so
 crypto
 continues
 to
 get


hit
 right
 here.
 That's
 hurting
 Robin


Hood
 as
 well
 as
 we're
 down
 about
 5.59%.


Bitcoin
 right
 there
 85,431.


Bitcoin
 tried
 to
 make
 a
 move
 closer
 to


87,


then
 it
 got
 rejected.
 Same
 thing
 with


Ethereum
 as
 it
 tried
 to
 break
 2850.
 Wow.


2780.
 There
 you
 go.
 There's
 your
 break


below
 2800


as
 that
 one
 continues
 to
 go
 down.
 Micro


Strategy


just
 destroyed
 9%
 down.
 So,
 I
 tax
 lost


harvested
 and
 Misti
 last
 week.
 So,
 I'm


officially
 out
 of
 Misti.
 It's
 500


shares.
 not
 a
 massive
 position.
 I
 know


there's
 other
 people
 that
 have
 a


relatively
 large
 position
 as
 they're


using
 it
 for
 income.
 Uh
 unfortunately,


Bitcoin
 didn't
 work
 out
 this
 year.
 I


mean,
 you
 got
 one
 month
 left.
 Maybe
 that


changes,
 but
 Bitcoin
 has
 now
 been
 net


negative
 for
 the
 year.
 Bonds
 have
 done


better
 than
 Bitcoin.
 And
 unfortunately,


S&P
 right
 there
 going
 red
 as
 well,
 679.


Unfortunately,
 Misti
 and
 Micro
 Strategy


is
 all
 contingent
 on
 Bitcoin.
 Now,


again,
 Sailor
 did
 announce
 that
 1


uh
 1.4
 4
 billion
 reserve
 today
 of
 USD.


So,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 that
 signals
 that
 a


lot
 of
 the
 people
 that
 are
 selling
 off


Micro
 Strategy
 because
 they're
 afraid


they're
 going
 to
 be
 a
 distressed
 asset,


you
 know,
 they
 should
 have
 enough
 money


to
 pay
 off
 their
 interest
 for
 the


foreseeable
 future
 on
 the
 preferred


equities.
 But
 the
 name
 of
 the
 game
 is


not
 if
 Sailor
 is
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 pay


off
 his
 debt.
 It's
 more
 so
 if
 Bitcoin


can
 start
 moving.
 Until
 it
 does,
 you


know,
 these
 questions
 are
 going
 to


continue
 to
 linger.
 the
 options
 market


for
 Micro
 Strategy,
 which
 is
 part
 of
 its


appeal,
 is
 going
 to
 get
 less
 lucrative


the
 more
 it
 falls.
 So,
 less
 money


ultimately
 is
 going
 to
 be
 coming
 into


the
 ecosystem.
 Okay.
 The
 JP
 Morgan
 thing


on
 uh


the
 JP
 Morgan
 thing
 over
 the
 weekend,
 I


think,
 is
 the
 dumbest
 thing
 I've
 ever


heard.
 I'm
 sorry,
 but
 the
 argument
 is
 JP


Morgan
 is
 short
 Micro
 Strategy
 and
 if


Micro
 Strategy
 were
 to
 go
 up
 by
 50%,
 JP


Morgan,
 an
 $850
 billion
 company,
 16


times
 bigger
 than
 Micro
 Strategy,
 would


go
 bankrupt.


I
 think
 the
 people
 propagating
 this


rumor
 on
 Twitter
 have
 gotten
 to
 the


point
 of
 cope.
 And
 trust
 me,
 I've
 been


there
 before.
 I
 know
 what
 it
 feels
 like


to
 cope
 on
 something
 that's
 not
 working.


But
 Micro
 Strategy
 is
 not
 down
 because


JP
 Morgan
 has
 a
 conspiracy
 theory
 to
 put


Sailor
 out
 of
 business
 because
 their


short
 position,
 which
 by
 the
 way,
 Mic


Strategy
 is
 only
 short
 at
 10%.
 In
 in
 its


entirety,
 it's
 not
 like
 JP
 Morgan
 is


short
 the
 entire
 10%.
 Even
 if
 they
 were,


that
 would
 not
 be
 enough
 to
 blow
 up
 the


entire
 financial
 institution
 that
 is
 JP


Morgan
 Chase
 if
 Micro
 Strategy
 ended
 up


going
 to
 $325
 a
 share.


So
 yeah,
 I
 really
 think
 that
 the
 people


pushing
 this
 narrative
 are
 desperate
 for


like
 and
 the
 reason
 that
 you
 might
 be,


well,
 why
 are
 they
 pushing
 this


narrative?
 The
 reason
 they're
 pushing


this
 narrative
 is
 because
 they're
 trying


to
 have
 like
 a
 GameStop
 moment.
 They're


trying
 to
 get
 all
 the
 bulls
 to
 come


together
 and
 be
 like,
 we
 hate
 Jamie


Diamond
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 stick
 it
 to


the
 man
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 buy
 MSTR


stock
 and
 it's
 not
 working.
 And
 the


reason
 it's
 not
 working
 has
 nothing
 to


do
 with
 JP
 Morgan.
 It's
 because
 Bitcoin


unfortunately
 has
 not
 has
 not
 played


out.


So
 yeah,
 I
 mean
 Micro
 Strategy
 was
 good


when
 Bitcoin
 was
 going
 up.


Unfortunately,
 Bitcoin's
 not
 going
 up.


So
 Micro
 Strategy
 is
 bad.
 I
 I
 think
 it's


that
 simple.
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 don't


think
 it
 has
 to
 get
 that
 much
 more


complicated.
 Like
 it's
 a
 leverage.
 Same


thing
 with
 BMR.
 It's
 a
 leverage
 against


Ethereum.
 If
 those
 assets
 that
 the


digital
 asset
 treasury
 is
 leveraged


against
 don't
 work,
 the
 DAT
 is
 not
 going


to
 work
 either.


So
 Robin
 Hood
 also
 has
 crypto
 exposure.


Robin
 is
 just
 more
 of
 a
 diversified


business.
 Coinbase
 also
 is
 less


diversified
 than
 Robin
 Hooded,
 but
 they


do
 more
 than
 just
 buy
 Bitcoin
 on
 the


balance
 sheet.
 And
 so
 they're
 not


getting
 hit
 as
 bad
 as
 MSTR,
 but
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 because
 of


because
 of
 JP
 Morgan.


Um


JPM,
 by
 the
 way,
 that
 stock
 has
 been
 a


great
 stock
 this
 year,
 down
 half
 a


percent
 on
 the
 day.
 Goldman
 Sachs
 as


well,
 up
 a
 lot
 year
 this
 year.
 Yeah,
 JP


Morgan
 30%.
 I
 mean
 JP
 Morgan's


outperforming
 Nvidia


which
 is
 quite
 incredible
 this
 year.


Okay,
 let's
 see
 what
 else
 we've
 got


going
 on
 in
 terms
 of
 headlines.
 You
 had


someone
 by
 3.4
 million
 in
 Tesla
 calls


for
 December
 26th.
 440
 is
 the
 strike.
 So


you
 got
 four
 million
 of
 calls
 just
 came


in.
 Three
 and
 a
 half
 million
 on
 Tessy


Tess
 right
 there
 428.35%.
 Again,
 Elon


did
 do
 an
 interview
 over
 the
 weekend
 had


a
 lot
 of
 different
 quotes.
 One
 of
 the


big
 quotes
 was
 that
 he
 is
 very
 bullish


on
 Google
 and
 Nvidia.
 He
 was
 asked
 like


what
 stocks
 would
 you
 buy?
 And
 he
 didn't


say
 I
 would
 buy
 them,
 but
 he
 basically


said
 that,
 you
 know,
 if
 one
 were
 to


invest
 in
 AI,
 Google,
 Nvidia
 are


no-brainers
 to
 him.
 Um,
 and
 then
 this
 is


what
 he
 had
 to
 say
 about
 the
 convergence


between
 SpaceX,
 Tesla,
 and
 XAI,
 which
 I


know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 been
 wondering


how
 these
 three
 come
 together.


Well,
 I
 I
 think
 that
 there's


increasingly
 a
 a
 convergence
 actually


between
 SpaceX
 and
 Tesla
 and
 XAI
 um
 in


that
 if
 the
 future
 is
 um
 solar
 powered


AI
 satellites,
 which
 it
 pretty
 much


needs
 to
 be
 in
 order
 to
 um
 in
 order
 to


harness
 a
 non-trivial
 amount
 of
 the


energy
 of
 the
 sun,
 you
 have
 to
 move
 to


solar
 powered
 AI
 satellites
 in
 deep


space.
 Um
 which
 somewhat
 is
 a
 confluence


of
 Tesla
 expertise
 and
 SpaceX
 expertise.


um
 and
 XAI
 on
 the
 AI
 front.
 So,
 it
 does


feel
 like
 over
 time
 there's
 somewhat
 of


a
 convergence
 there.
 Um
 but
 all
 the


companies
 are
 doing
 doing
 great
 things.


Um
 very
 proud
 of
 the
 teams.
 They
 do


great
 work.
 Um
 so,
 you
 know,
 we're


making
 great
 progress
 with
 Tesla
 on
 the


autonomous
 driving.
 I
 don't
 know if


you've
 tried
 the
 self-driving.


>> The
 guy
 ended
 up
 saying
 I
 I
 I've
 tried


it
 in
 a
 Whimo,
 not
 not
 in
 a
 Tesla.
 I
 was


like,
 "Bro,
 you're
 interviewing
 Elon


Musk."
 like


maybe
 you
 should
 have
 tried
 FSD
 before.


But
 um
 look,
 I
 I
 think
 I
 think
 I
 think


that's
 why
 Elon's
 getting
 a
 lot of


people
 excited.
 I
 mean,
 one
 of
 the
 the


ways
 to
 justify
 this
 trillion
 dollar


Tesla
 package
 is
 by
 converging
 the


companies
 you're
 working
 on,
 even
 if


they're
 not
 explicitly
 owned
 by
 Tesla
 to


one
 day
 be
 working
 with
 Tesla.
 And
 you


know,
 that's
 probably
 why
 the
 XAI
 uh


ownership
 stake
 fund
 Tesla
 is
 also
 going


to
 go
 through
 over
 the
 time
 over
 the


next
 few
 years.
 And
 that's
 something


that
 I
 think
 shareholders
 are
 going
 to


be
 very
 excited
 for
 as
 well.
 But
 you


know,
 one
 thing
 that
 Bur
 said
 also
 in


the
 Substack
 about
 Tesla
 is
 that
 he


thinks
 the
 pay
 package
 is
 ridiculous
 for


Elon.
 Again,
 1
 trillion
 sounds


ridiculous
 on
 paper,
 but
 if
 he's
 talking


about
 satellites
 in
 space
 and
 data


centers
 in
 space
 and
 SpaceX
 converging


with
 the
 XAI
 models
 to
 work
 with
 uh


what's
 going
 on
 with
 Tesla,
 there
 is
 a


real
 world
 where
 you
 could
 easily


justify
 how
 that
 is
 worth
 a
 trillion
 if


the
 overall
 company
 is
 worth
 a
 lot
 more


than
 just
 a
 trillion.
 So,
 it's
 something


we're
 going to
 have
 to
 see
 play
 out
 in


the
 next
 couple
 years.
 One
 thing
 that


might
 play
 out
 in
 the
 next
 couple


months,
 maybe
 the
 next
 couple
 weeks
 is


OpenAI
 introducing
 advertising.
 So,
 this


went
 viral
 over
 the
 weekend.
 Chat
 GBT's


Android
 app
 latest
 beta
 includes
 new


references
 to
 an
 ads
 feature
 and
 a


search
 ads
 carousel.


It
 looks
 like
 advertising
 is
 coming
 to


Chat
 GPT.
 Here's
 a
 video
 that
 Austin


posted
 over
 the
 weekend
 uh
 with
 how


Samman
 has
 talked
 about
 ads


historically.
 ChatBT
 would
 consistently


be
 reported
 as
 like
 a
 user's
 most


trusted
 technology
 product
 from
 a
 big


tech
 company.
 We
 don't
 really
 think
 of


ourselves
 as
 a
 big
 tech
 company,
 but
 I


guess
 we
 sort
 of
 are
 now.
 And
 that's


very
 odd
 on
 the
 surface,
 right?
 Cuz
 AI


is
 the
 thing
 that
 hallucinates.
 AI
 is


the
 thing
 with
 all
 the
 errors.
 And
 this


was
 when
 they
 were
 that
 was
 a
 much
 more


of
 a
 problem.
 And
 there
 is
 a
 question
 of


why
 ads
 on
 a
 Google
 search
 are
 dependent


on
 Google
 doing
 badly.
 Like
 if
 it
 was


giving
 you
 the
 best
 answer,
 there'd
 be


no
 reason
 ever
 to
 buy
 an
 ad
 above
 it.
 So


you
 kind
 of
 like
 you're
 like
 that
 thing


is
 not
 quite
 aligned
 with
 me.
 Chad
 GBT


maybe
 it
 gives
 you
 the
 best
 answer
 maybe


it
 doesn't
 but
 you're
 paying
 it
 or


hopefully
 yall
 are
 paying
 it
 and
 it's
 at


least
 trying
 to
 give
 you
 the
 best
 answer


and
 that
 has
 led
 to
 people
 having
 like
 a


deep
 and
 pretty
 trusting
 relationship


with
 Chacht.
 You
 asked
 Chach
 for
 the


best
 hotel
 not
 Google
 or
 something
 else.


If
 Chacht
 were
 accepting
 payment
 to
 put


a
 worse
 hotel
 above
 a
 better
 hotel


that's
 probably
 catastrophic
 for
 your


relationship
 with
 Chacht.
 Um,
 on
 the


other
 hand,
 if
 ChachBT
 shows
 you


it's
 guess
 the
 best
 hotel,
 whatever
 that


is,
 and
 then
 if
 you
 book
 it
 with
 one


click,
 takes
 the
 same
 cut
 that
 it
 would


take
 from
 any
 other
 hotel,
 and
 there's


nothing
 that
 influenced
 it,
 but
 there's


some
 sort
 of
 transaction
 fee.
 I
 think


that's
 probably
 okay.


Well,
 he's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 figure
 out


how
 to
 incorporate
 advertising
 in
 a


meaningful
 way.
 uh
 because
 now
 he's


getting
 into
 the
 game
 or
 at least


opening
 eye
 is
 getting
 into
 the
 game.


And
 by
 the
 way,
 they
 kind
 of
 have
 to
 get


into
 this
 game.
 Google
 right
 here
 316.
 I


mean,
 how
 else
 will
 they
 make
 money
 in


the
 short
 term
 until
 they
 develop
 a


business
 model
 that
 is
 not
 just


contingent
 on
 $20
 a
 month
 or
 $200
 a


month
 subscriptions?
 They're
 going
 to


need
 ads.
 It's
 why
 Google
 and
 Meta
 have


some
 of
 the
 best
 business
 models
 on
 the


planet.
 It's
 ad
 I
 mean
 there
 there's,


you
 know,
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 this
 a


couple
 months
 ago,
 but
 there's
 not
 a
 ton


of
 ways
 to
 make
 money.
 Like
 there's


there
 I
 should
 say
 there's
 a
 ton
 of


examples
 on
 how
 to
 make
 money,
 but


there's
 not
 that
 many
 business
 models


that
 are
 out
 there.
 The
 main
 three
 are


you
 pay
 for
 a
 product
 or
 service,


company
 gives
 you
 it,
 you
 give
 them


money,
 you
 lend
 people
 money,
 people
 pay


you
 interest
 on
 that
 money,
 or
 you


advertise
 in
 order
 to
 get
 people
 to
 know


about
 the
 product
 or
 service.
 I
 mean,


like
 a
 lot
 of
 business
 models
 revolve


around
 those
 three
 major
 concepts.
 You


sell
 a
 product
 or
 service
 for
 a
 fee,
 you


advertise
 a
 product
 or
 service
 for
 a


fee,
 or
 you
 lend
 for
 a
 fee.
 And
 so
 I'm


sure
 there's
 more
 creative
 models
 around


business
 that
 will
 allow
 AI
 to
 be


monetized.
 I
 know
 OpenAI
 has
 talked
 a


lot
 about
 rev
 sharing
 with
 drug


companies
 for
 example.
 They
 do
 the


research.
 They
 get
 upside
 of
 the
 drug.


But
 that's
 not
 immediate
 revenue.


Immediate
 revenue
 is
 ads.


And
 ads
 should
 theoretically
 be
 what


carries
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of
 the
 growth


over
 the
 next
 couple
 years.
 But
 they're


going
 to
 have
 to
 do
 it
 in
 a
 way
 that's


not
 intrusive.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I


like
 about
 the
 LMS
 is
 they're
 never


trying
 to
 sell
 me
 anything.
 Whenever
 I


ask
 a
 question,
 I
 know
 that
 I'm
 getting


a
 real
 response.
 micro
 strategy
 now
 down


11%
 that
 I
 can
 engage
 with.


Unfortunately,
 if
 the
 ads
 come
 in,
 I
 I


think
 it
 might


potentially
 weaken
 the
 trust.
 Now,


granted,
 if
 you
 can
 put
 the
 ads
 in
 in
 a


meaningful
 way,
 maybe
 it
 helps
 me.
 You


know,
 this
 is
 where
 Google
 has
 an
 edge.


They've
 been
 doing
 ads
 for
 20
 years,
 and


Gemini,
 I
 would
 imagine,
 can
 make
 the


ads
 uh
 integrated
 in
 a
 way
 that
 doesn't


feel
 weird.
 But
 Chad
 is
 going
 to
 have
 to


figure
 it
 out


for
 this
 to
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.
 S&P


right
 there
 679
 Robin
 Hood
 down
 today


actually
 doesn't
 surprise
 me
 at
 all.
 The


reason
 Hood
 pumped
 last
 week
 was
 because


of
 that
 uh
 prediction
 markets
 news.
 I


mean
 look
 I
 liked
 it
 but
 I
 mean
 it
 was


just
 a
 piece
 of
 news
 on
 Robin
 Hood's


future
 endeavors
 that
 pumped
 at
 11%.
 And


like
 it
 did
 it
 deserve
 a
 move?
 Yeah,
 I


was
 shocked
 by
 11.
 I
 did
 not
 expect
 it


would
 be
 made
 Thanksgiving
 a
 lot
 better


knowing
 hood
 pump
 by
 but
 I
 could
 I
 mean


it
 makes
 sense
 why
 it's
 reversing
 like


the
 prediction
 markets
 news
 is
 bullish


but
 like
 it's
 not
 something
 that's
 going


to
 immediately
 change
 the
 company


tomorrow
 they're
 still
 splitting
 the
 fee


with
 kshi
 so
 it's
 not
 doubling
 the


revenues
 by
 getting
 rid
 of
 the
 koshi
 fee


and
 then
 you
 have
 bitcoin
 d
 goes
 from
 91


to
 85
 I
 mean
 like
 unfortunately
 that's


going
 to
 end
 up
 affecting
 something
 like


a
 hood
 same
 thing
 with
 a
 coinbase
 that's


also
 down
 7%.


The
 real
 question
 is
 why
 are
 people


selling
 Bitcoin?
 84,000.
 Bro,
 it
 was


just
 at
 86
 I
 think
 while
 we
 played
 the


Sam
 Alman
 video.
 It
 dropped
 two
 grand.


Can
 people
 like
 stop
 selling
 this
 thing?


Like


can
 we
 can
 we
 not
 like
 can
 we
 just
 like


can
 people
 just
 hold
 on
 to
 it?
 Like
 why


are
 they
 selling?


Like
 just
 just
 hold
 it.
 Just
 stop.
 Like,


can
 Sailor
 tell
 everyone
 to
 He
 keeps


tweeting
 all
 these
 AI
 pictures
 of
 him


holding
 these
 random
 objects,
 which
 I


love.
 But
 can
 he
 just
 tell
 people
 to


stop
 selling


because
 that
 would
 be
 nice.


Yeah,
 Bitcoin
 was
 up
 12%
 last
 week.


That's
 fair.
 So
 maybe
 it's
 just


reversing.


Tax
 loss
 harvesting.
 Well,
 it
 is
 that


month
 where


where
 I
 guess
 people
 start
 to
 do
 it.


I
 don't
 know.
 That
 is
 weird.
 But
 silver


and
 gold
 at
 the
 same
 time
 making
 a
 move


right
 here.
 Silver
 5222
 or
 silver
 57.
 I


SLV,
 the
 Black
 Rockck
 silver
 ETF
 that's


up
 2%.


Uh,
 the
 only
 update
 on
 Grabb
 over
 the


past
 couple
 days,
 this
 one
 came
 out
 this


morning,
 is
 that
 they're
 they're


replacing
 one
 of
 their
 board
 director.


One
 of
 their
 board
 directors
 is
 stepping


down
 and
 I
 haven't
 looked
 at
 the
 new


person
 who's
 on
 the
 board.
 I
 don't
 know


too
 much
 about
 them
 outside
 of
 the
 fact


that
 they
 were
 the
 vice
 president
 of


Madison
 Square
 Garden
 Entertainment


Corporation,


which
 I
 thought
 was
 pretty
 interesting


to
 have
 someone
 like
 that
 join
 the
 team.


So
 I
 think
 the
 big
 story
 for
 Grab
 again


is
 that
 they
 are
 probably
 going
 to
 be


acquiring
 GoTo
 based
 on
 the
 story
 if


anyone's
 been
 following
 it
 over
 the
 past


couple
 weeks.
 Go
 to
 CEO
 got
 ousted
 by


SoftBank.
 New
 CEO,
 new
 CEO
 is
 likely


going
 to
 allow
 the
 acquisition
 to
 go


through.
 Governments
 want
 the


acquisition
 to
 go
 through,
 especially


the
 Indonesian
 government.
 And
 that
 is


where
 I
 think
 you
 get
 a
 material


rerating
 on
 the
 company's
 growth


trajectory
 going
 into
 2026.


Unfortunately,


the
 market
 took
 a
 really
 big
 dump
 in


November
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 stocks
 have
 not


recovered.
 And
 you
 know,
 unless
 you're
 I


mean,
 if
 Nvidia
 is
 not
 recovering
 its


dump,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 hard
 for
 a
 Rocket


Lab,
 for
 a
 Grab,
 for
 an
 ESTs
 to


meaningfully
 recover.
 And
 so,
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 those
 names
 are
 just
 getting
 hit.


In Nvidia,
 right,
 they're
 up
 1.3%
 179.


That's
 getting
 a
 little
 spike
 as
 Bitcoin


goes
 down,


which
 is
 weird.
 Uh,
 looking
 at
 the


Japanese
 2-year,
 that's
 also
 spiking
 a


little
 bit
 right
 now.
 Maybe
 that's
 why


Bitcoin
 fell
 to
 84,000.
 The
 10-year


Japanese
 bond
 again
 spiked
 to
 its


highest
 level,
 1.84%
 since
 2008.


That
 was
 one
 of the
 reasons
 I
 think


Bitcoin
 got
 hit
 last
 night.


Again,
 you
 might
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people


that
 are
 just
 short
 Japan,
 long
 Bitcoin,


and
 if
 that
 trade
 reverses,
 they've
 got


to
 sell
 their
 Bitcoin
 to
 cover
 the


Japanese
 short.


So,
 that
 could
 be
 one
 of
 the
 issues.


GameStop's
 up
 a
 little bit,
 open
 doors


down
 5%,
 Broadcom
 down
 2%,
 Rocklab
 down


3.4,
 for
 S&P
 500
 back
 to
 67983.


If
 it
 is
 Japan,
 then
 I
 don't
 know.


If
 it
 is
 Japan,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 the


solution
 is.
 You
 know,
 Trump
 called
 the


uh
 the
 Japanese
 prime
 minister
 over
 the


week
 and
 said
 to
 stop
 talking
 [ __ ]
 about


Taiwan
 cuz
 this
 new
 lady
 who
 who's
 the


prime
 minister
 of
 Japan
 uh
 she
 she


China's
 delegates
 came
 and
 she
 openly


told
 them,
 "Don't
 mess
 with
 Taiwan."
 And


then
 China
 got
 pretty
 pissed
 off
 that


she
 said
 that.
 And
 then
 apparently,


according
 to
 Politico,
 Trump
 called
 her


last
 week
 and
 said,
 "Don't
 do
 that
 [ __ ]


Don't
 do
 that
 shit."


It
 was
 like,
 "Don't
 say
 that
 shit."
 And


you
 know,
 maybe
 that'll
 calm
 down
 some


of
 the
 fears.
 But
 but
 like
 again,
 that


that
 that
 once
 again
 goes
 to
 this


argument
 around
 Japan.
 It's
 just
 like


what
 is
 happening?
 Well,
 they're


printing.
 They're
 speaking
 a
 little


spicy.
 and


their
 bond
 deals
 are
 not
 cooperating


which
 potentially
 could
 be
 creating


issues


for
 the
 equity
 markets.
 Yeah,
 Trump
 and


Venezuela.
 So,
 the
 update
 on
 that
 is


that


um


Trump
 will
 be
 meeting.


Okay,
 so
 I
 don't
 know if
 this
 is
 going


to
 be
 live,
 but
 yeah,
 this
 probably
 not


be
 live,
 but
 he's
 going
 to
 be
 meeting


with
 the
 cabinet,
 including
 Secretary
 of


State
 and
 Keith
 Hex
 to
 discuss
 Venezuela


at
 5:00
 PM
 Eastern
 at
 the
 Oval
 Office


today.


Maybe
 they're
 going
 to
 do
 a
 stream
 after


they
 have
 the
 discussion
 and
 like
 kind


of
 answer
 questions.
 But
 honestly,
 dude,


I
 I
 still
 have
 not
 deeply
 looked
 at
 the


Venezuela
 situation.
 Like,
 I
 did
 not


spend
 time
 over
 the
 weekend
 analyzing


it.
 I
 did
 know
 that
 Trump
 tweeted
 that


the
 airspace
 above
 Venezuela


uh
 was
 now
 closed


or
 well,
 he's
 basically
 saying
 don't
 fly


above
 it.
 This
 is
 the
 tweet.
 Uh
 to
 all


airlines,
 pilots,
 drug
 dealers,
 and


human
 traffickers,
 please
 consider
 the


airspace
 above
 and
 surrounding
 Venezuela


to
 be
 closed
 in
 its
 entirety.
 Tweet
 that


on
 the
 29th.


Yes,
 there
 is
 an
 argument
 that
 it
 is


deeply
 integrated
 into
 oil
 prices
 and
 if


we
 do
 get
 into
 some
 crazy
 war
 with


Venezuela,
 that
 could
 spike
 oil
 prices


aggressively.
 Crude's
 still
 been
 pretty


damn
 good
 below
 60.
 I
 mean,
 you
 can't


ask
 for
 a
 better
 price
 on
 oil
 this


entire
 year.
 it's
 been
 stuck
 below
 60
 or


barely
 above
 60.
 So,


and
 that's
 helped
 with
 keeping
 gas


prices
 down.
 Trump
 would
 like
 it
 to
 stay


that
 way
 because,
 you
 know,
 he
 wants
 oil


prices
 to
 continue
 staying
 low.
 But
 I


think
 the
 Venezuela
 conflict,
 if
 it
 does


turn
 into
 a
 legitimate
 conflict,
 is


something
 that
 we
 definitely
 have
 to


keep
 our
 eyes
 on.


Um,


all
 right,
 let's
 go
 to
 the
 heat
 map


right
 here.


That
 one's
 down.
 Where's
 Duelingo
 today?


Duolingo
 had
 a
 good
 day
 on
 Wednesday.


One
 of
 its
 best
 days.
 Duolingo
 down
 1%.


Well,
 it's
 actually
 it's
 not
 doing
 as


bad
 as
 some
 of
 these
 other
 stocks.


Here's
 the
 heat
 map.
 We're
 pretty
 red
 on


the
 day.
 Nvidia
 is
 one
 of
 the
 only
 tech


names
 that's
 green.
 Synopsis
 was
 up


seven,
 now
 it's
 up
 three.
 Walmart


actually
 holding
 on.
 Walmart's
 had
 a


pretty
 good
 run
 over
 the
 past
 couple


days
 as
 well.
 Walmart
 year
 to
 date
 is
 up


23%
 after
 a
 massive
 2024,


which
 is
 good
 to
 see.


And
 then
 stock
 draft.
 Let's
 pull
 that
 up


as
 well.
 Again,
 I
 do
 not
 actually
 own


Nvidia.
 It
 is
 or
 not
 Nvidia,
 uh,


Dolingo.
 It's
 just
 in
 my
 stock
 draft.
 We


are
 still
 up
 26%.
 Still
 in
 first
 place


even
 with
 a
 60%
 decline
 on
 Duelingo.


Matt's
 up
 18,
 Chris
 is
 up
 seven,


Tanner's
 up
 16,
 and
 then
 Steve
 is
 up


two.


By
 the
 way,
 for
 those
 asking
 about
 the


uh
 the
 dinner
 with
 Triple
 B
 and
 Steve


over
 the
 weekend,
 it
 was
 uh
 it
 was


great.
 We
 did
 it
 on
 Wednesday.
 Um
 I
 got


to
 show
 you
 guys
 this.
 You
 guys
 are


going
 to
 be
 proud
 of
 me,
 dude.
 You
 guys


are
 going
 to
 be
 real
 proud
 of
 me.


This
 is
 the
 steak
 that
 I
 ate.


Look
 at
 this,
 bro.


Just
 look.
 Can
 you
 believe
 that
 me
 out


of
 all
 people
 ate
 that
 steak?


And
 I
 loved
 it.
 I
 freaking
 loved
 it,


dude.
 It
 was
 Look
 at
 that,
 dude.


That
 is
 I
 mean,


they
 brought
 it
 on
 the
 table
 and
 because


they
 kind
 of
 ordered
 for
 the
 entire


table,
 so
 like
 we
 didn't
 individually


order.
 And
 TripleB
 was
 awesome.
 It
 was


great.
 It
 was
 great
 connecting
 with
 him.


Derek
 was
 there.
 It
 was
 great
 connecting


him.
 We
 got
 to
 Steve
 got
 to
 meet


everybody.
 My
 sister,
 my
 cousin,
 came
 so


they
 got
 to
 meet
 these
 guys.
 It
 was
 a


great
 time
 and
 it
 was
 just
 really
 fun
 to


connect
 with
 everybody
 and
 talk
 about


the
 markets
 and
 all
 that
 stuff.
 But
 then


they
 they they
 they
 brought
 in
 these


porter
 houses
 and
 yeah,
 as
 you
 guys
 are


saying,
 it
 looked
 like
 it's
 alive.
 It


did.


And
 I
 said,
 you
 know what?
 Screw
 it.
 I'm


just
 going
 to
 close
 my
 eyes
 and
 eat
 it.


And
 I
 I
 can't
 say
 I
 didn't
 enjoy
 it.
 I


really
 I
 ate
 a
 lot
 of
 steak.
 Like
 I
 ate


a
 My
 sister
 couldn't
 touch
 it.
 My
 sister


could
 like
 like
 the
 pink
 was
 freaking


her
 out.
 My
 cousin
 tried
 to
 eat
 around


the
 edges.
 She
 ate
 a
 little bit
 of
 it.


She
 could
 She
 was,
 you
 know,
 she
 was


just
 like,
 "It's
 too
 pink."
 I
 mean,
 you


could
 have
 seared
 it
 on
 the
 plate
 as


well,
 but
 like
 and
 and
 they
 seared
 it
 a


little
 bit,
 but
 I
 just
 I
 just
 straight


up
 ate
 it
 and
 I
 didn't
 care.
 So,
 I
 don't


know.
 Maybe
 your
 boy
 is
 That's
 not
 even


medium
 rare.
 That's
 That's
 That's
 like
 a


little
 bit
 below
 medium
 rare.
 That's


intense.
 And
 I
 said,
 "I
 don't
 care.
 I'm


eating
 it."
 Steve
 loved
 it.
 That's
 how


Steve
 eats
 a
 steak.
 Steve
 legit
 eats
 a


steak.
 fiery
 pink
 in
 the
 center.


And
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 became
 a
 man,
 dude.


I
 feel
 like
 I
 became
 a
 man.
 So
 now,


obviously,
 do
 I
 prefer
 that?
 No.
 I
 like


it
 a
 bit
 more
 cooked,
 but


I
 really
 like
 you
 can
 ask
 anyone
 who
 was


there,
 dude.
 I
 ate
 like
 almost
 eight,


nine
 pieces
 from
 that
 porter
 house.
 I


was
 not
 scared
 to
 eat
 the
 steak.


So
 that's
 how
 you're
 supposed
 to
 eat
 it.


Yeah,
 I
 guess
 that's
 how
 you're
 supposed


to
 eat
 it.


It
 was
 definitely
 a
 uh
 a
 new
 experience


for
 me,
 but
 overall
 it
 was
 good
 and
 uh


dinner
 itself
 was
 super
 fun.
 So
 was
 very


very
 happy
 that
 uh
 that
 we
 ended
 up


doing
 it.
 Um
 okay,
 let's
 see
 what
 other


headlines
 do
 we
 have.


Bank
 of
 America,
 we
 talked
 about
 that


rate
 cut
 probability


that's
 wow,
 Bitcoin
 below
 84.
 My


goodness,
 who
 is
 taking
 this
 down
 today?


83.


It
 did
 get
 to
 80
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks
 ago.


It
 was
 for
 like
 a
 split
 second
 and
 then


it
 recovered.


So,
 I
 guess
 the
 market
 wants
 us
 to
 test


some
 lows
 again.


Is
 anyone
 here
 selling
 the
 crypto?
 Just


be
 honest.
 Did
 anyone
 like
 just
 say,
 you


know what,
 I'm
 up
 on
 my
 Bitcoin.
 I
 need


to
 secure
 some
 gains.
 Or
 maybe
 I'm
 down,


but
 I
 don't
 feel
 like
 being
 stuck
 in
 it


anymore.
 Did
 you
 have
 to
 sell
 for
 like


bills
 you
 have
 to
 pay
 or
 something
 like?


Put
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you
 if
 you
 took
 some


profits
 on
 this.


Obviously
 to
 move
 the
 prices


aggressively.
 It's
 not
 just
 retail.


There's
 got
 to
 be
 something
 deeper
 here.


By
 the
 way,
 I
 was
 reading
 this
 stat
 from


Bloomberg.
 Um


it's
 kind
 of
 crazy,
 but
 for
 every


Let
 me
 pull
 up
 the
 exact
 stack.
 For


every
 uh
 1
 billion
 pulled
 from
 Bitcoin


from
 from
 the
 Bitcoin
 ETFs,
 that's
 a


three
 and a
 half%
 drop
 in
 Bitcoin's


price.


It's
 kind
 of
 crazy.
 And
 you
 have
 seen
 a


lot
 of
 the
 outflows


on
 those
 ETFs
 come
 in.


So,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 we
 just
 have
 a


little
 bit
 more
 bearish
 sentiment
 around


Bitcoin.
 Did
 you
 watch
 Andre's
 video
 on


it?
 Yes,
 I
 actually
 did
 watch
 Andre's


video.
 So,
 Andre's
 video
 actually
 has
 a


really
 interesting
 point
 from
 a


technical
 analysis
 perspective,
 and
 you


can
 either
 hate
 technical
 analysis
 or


love
 TA,
 but
 um
 his
 argument
 was
 that


like


there's
 a
 specific
 amount
 of
 days
 for


Bitcoin
 to
 go
 up
 and
 down.
 And


as
 a
 result,
 you
 have
 365
 days
 until
 the


next


peak.
 So,
 let
 me
 let
 me
 just
 play
 a
 clip


from
 that
 video
 right
 here
 that
 I


thought
 was
 also


really
 interesting.
 He's
 looking
 at
 the


historical
 patterns
 on
 how
 Bitcoin
 has


sold
 off,
 50
 days
 for
 this
 cycle.
 But


what's
 also
 very
 interesting
 is
 that
 the


last
 cycles,
 cycles
 three
 and
 four,
 also


took
 the
 exact
 same
 amount,
 1,50ish


days.
 Now,
 check
 this
 out.
 I
 know
 it


looks
 complicated,
 but
 this
 chart
 shows


kind
 of
 the
 same
 thing.
 Bitcoins


followed
 the
 same
 pattern,
 but


alternating
 from
 the
 all-time
 low
 to
 the


all-time
 high
 and
 then
 all-time
 high
 to


the
 all-time
 low.
 So,
 for
 example,
 in


2015,
 from
 the
 all-time
 low
 to
 the


all-time
 high,
 it
 took
 Bitcoin
 1,50ish


days.
 And
 then
 in
 2017,
 from
 the


all-time
 high
 to
 the
 all-time
 low,
 it


took
 Bitcoin
 about
 a
 year,
 364
 days.


Then
 in
 2018,
 from
 the
 all-time
 low
 to


the
 all-time
 high,
 it
 took
 again
 1,50ish


days.
 And
 again,
 from
 the
 all-time
 high


in
 2021
 to
 the
 all-time
 low,
 it
 took
 364


days.
 Well,
 guess
 how
 long
 it
 took
 us
 to


go
 from
 the
 all-time
 low
 to
 the
 all-time


high
 in
 this
 cycle?


150
 to
 1,64-ish
 days.
 Which
 means
 if


this
 pattern
 continues,
 we
 should
 reach


the
 all-time
 low
 364


days
 from
 our
 all-time
 high,
 which


happened
 on
 October
 6th
 of
 this
 year.


That
 means
 we
 are
 on
 around
 October
 5th,


2026
 when
 Bitcoin
 could
 reach
 the


all-time
 low
 of
 this
 cycle.


I
 mean,
 hate
 it
 or
 love
 it,
 it's
 a


pretty
 simple
 explanation.
 You
 don't


have
 to
 agree
 with
 it,
 but
 like
 a
 third


grader
 could
 understand
 that


explanation.
 He's
 just
 looking
 at
 the


previous
 cycles
 from
 now
 or
 from
 lows
 to


highs
 and
 then
 from
 highs
 to
 lows
 and


literally
 just
 copying
 those
 numbers.


Now
 I
 think
 the
 entire
 thesis
 for
 a
 lot


of
 the
 the
 crypto
 bulls
 is
 that
 that


entire
 concept
 of
 a
 cycle
 should
 be


broken
 because
 in
 the
 previous
 cycles


which
 coincidentally
 just
 have
 all
 the


days
 line
 up
 the
 way
 they
 do
 which
 I


don't
 know
 if
 you
 want
 to
 call
 it
 irony


or
 fate
 or
 it
 is
 kind
 of
 weird
 that
 they


line
 up
 the
 way
 they
 do
 but
 uh
 the
 the


the
 ETFs
 and
 the
 level
 of
 buying
 from
 a


JP
 Morgan,
 a
 Goldman
 Sachs,
 the


institutionalization
 of
 the
 products


that
 makes
 this
 time
 different.
 That
 is


the
 argument
 from,
 you
 know,
 people
 who


are
 incredibly
 bullish
 against
 the
 four


years.
 I
 mean,
 quite
 frankly,
 Tom
 Lee


has
 said
 the
 four-year
 cycle
 is
 broken


and
 he
 has
 his
 own
 data
 to
 kind
 of
 make


sense
 of
 that.
 If
 it's
 not
 broken,
 which


I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 I
 I
 really
 don't


know.
 Like,
 I
 I
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 not


broken
 because
 like
 logically
 it
 makes


sense.
 Why
 would
 the
 cycle
 exist
 when


you
 have
 so
 many
 new
 players
 in
 the


space
 that
 are
 uh
 market
 participants


that
 have
 different
 incentives?
 But
 then


again,
 you
 know,
 why
 did
 the
 cycle
 even


exist
 in
 the
 first
 place?
 And
 I
 know
 it


has
 to
 do
 with
 the
 having,
 but
 I
 mean
 I


don't know
 there
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 nuance


now
 into
 how
 people
 are
 thinking
 of


this.
 Maybe
 some
 of
 the
 OGs
 are
 selling


simply
 because
 they
 deeply
 believe
 in


that
 cycle
 and
 as
 a
 result
 they
 they


enter
 in
 at
 a
 at
 a
 different
 time.
 But


if
 that's
 the
 case,
 then
 October
 2026
 is


when
 we
 see


uh
 another
 decline.


And
 if
 that's
 the
 case,
 then


you
 know,
 maybe
 that'll
 be
 when
 we
 see


or
 sorry,
 that's
 when
 we
 see
 the
 next


alltime
 low.
 And
 if
 that's
 the
 case,


then
 we
 got
 a
 year
 of
 pain
 to
 wait.
 It


would
 be
 kind
 of
 crazy
 if
 that's
 what
 if


if
 he's
 right
 about
 how
 the
 cycle
 lines


up
 and
 it
 actually
 comes
 down
 that
 way.


It
 would
 be
 incredible.


Tanner
 says,
 "A
 pattern
 with
 two
 hits,


big
 data."
 Yeah,
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you


can
 just
 fully
 dismiss
 the
 two
 hits


given
 Bitcoin's
 only
 been
 around


since
 2010,
 right?


Like
 the
 two
 hits
 line
 up
 pretty


closely.
 I
 mean,
 the
 fact
 that
 it's
 a,50


days
 every
 time
 and
 then
 364
 days
 every


time
 for
 the
 lows
 to
 the
 highs,
 like


I
 get
 it,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 it's
 maybe


it's
 maybe
 it's
 just
 coincidence


and
 I'm
 by
 no
 means
 an
 expert
 on
 the


cyclicality
 of
 Bitcoin,
 but
 it
 is


interesting
 to
 say
 the
 least.
 And
 if
 we


do
 end
 up
 going
 down
 October
 2026,
 now


the
 scary
 part
 about
 this
 is
 if
 it
 does


end
 up
 going
 down
 uh
 and
 bottoming
 in


2026
 October,


is
 that
 a
 signal
 for
 the
 entire
 market


to
 be
 because
 last
 time
 this
 happened
 in


2022
 was
 a
 bare
 market
 and
 Bitcoin
 led


that
 bare
 market
 to
 the
 downside.
 I


think
 it
 it
 bottomed
 at
 like
 15,000.


It's
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 believe
 that
 given


the
 S&P
 500
 earnings
 growth,
 given
 the


rate
 cutting
 cycle.
 The
 rate
 cutting


cycle,
 by
 the
 way,
 should
 be
 bullish
 for


Bitcoin
 in
 2026,
 regardless
 of
 this


cyclical
 uh
 analysis
 that
 Andre


presented.
 So,


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think
 over
 the
 next


year,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see


really
 how
 this
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.


I'll
 send
 it
 I'll
 send
 it.
 Yeah,
 I'll


send
 the
 link
 right
 here.


Tanner.


Oh,
 Tanner
 hates
 Tanner,
 you
 must
 have


hated
 this
 analysis.
 He's
 typing
 in
 caps


in
 the
 chat.


He
 says
 it
 didn't
 even
 hit
 the
 all-time


highs
 when
 Andre
 was
 sharing
 it.
 Well,


if
 he's
 off
 by
 a
 day
 or
 two,
 I
 don't


think
 that's
 necessarily
 invalidating


what
 he
 showed.


And
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 he's
 wrong
 about
 the


2025
 alltime
 high.


like
 yeah
 maybe
 he's
 off
 by
 like
 a
 day


or
 maybe
 even
 a
 week
 but
 at
 its
 core
 I


don't
 November
 2021
 is
 what
 I
 see
 on
 his


chart
 and
 then
 August
 2025
 is
 what
 I
 see


on
 his
 chart
 right
 there


I
 don't
 know
 dude
 maybe
 maybe
 he's
 wrong


maybe
 he's
 right
 but
 the


institutionalization
 of
 cryptos
 I
 think


what's
 changing
 more


it
 was
 a
 mere
 approximation
 he
 was


quoting
 charts
 off
 someone
 else
 who's
 at


Yeah,
 he
 was
 quoting
 someone
 else's.


This
 is
 not
 even
 Andre's
 thesis.
 He
 was


just
 showing
 someone
 else's
 thesis
 as


well.


Robin
 right
 there
 120.85
 that's
 down
 6%.


Ethereum
 2750.
 And
 then
 Reddit
 220.96


that's
 up
 2%.


Tanner
 says,
 "Give
 him
 a
 call."
 Dude,


Tanner
 is
 the
 biggest
 Bitcoin
 bull


that
 uh
 that
 I
 didn't
 know
 existed.
 This


guy
 is
 freaking
 saying
 he
 needs
 to
 call


into
 the
 show
 to
 talk
 about.
 All right,


Tanner,
 I'm
 calling
 you
 right
 here.


[Laughter]


>> Yo,


>> when
 did
 when
 did
 you
 love
 Bitcoin
 so


much?


>> Uh,
 not
 that
 it's
 not
 that
 I
 love


Bitcoin
 as
 much
 as
 I
 just
 find
 TA
 so


confusing.
 Doesn't
 make
 any
 sense
 to
 me.


>> Okay.
 So,
 what
 what
 is
 your
 uh
 issue


with
 Andre's


>> I
 don't
 know if
 you
 want
 to
 call
 it
 TA.


It
 it
 was
 more
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 was
 TA.


It
 was
 more
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 just


analysis
 on
 the
 number
 of
 days
 from


highs
 to
 lows,
 right?


>> I
 mean
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 TA
 means
 but
 I


wouldn't
 call
 this
 fundamental
 analysis.


>> I
 I
 would
 agree.
 I
 would
 agree.


>> Okay.
 So
 look
 at
 the
 first
 hit
 in
 um
 you


know
 2017
 2018
 or
 or
 in
 the
 2018
 era.
 He


said
 the
 all-time
 high
 was
 hit
 and
 then


put
 this
 bar
 that's
 like
 at
 the
 bottom.


It
 it
 doesn't
 even
 that's
 not
 where
 it


hit
 the
 all-time
 high


>> when


>> you
 know
 it


>> I
 mean


>> Go
 ahead.


>> Okay.
 So
 your
 beef
 is
 that
 it's
 like
 a


little
 off
 because
 it
 the
 alltime
 high


was
 definitely
 hit
 around
 that
 time


frame.


>> Yeah.
 Around
 that
 time
 frame.
 What
 he's


saying
 is
 it's
 so
 coincidental
 that


they're
 all
 364
 days.
 If
 he's
 playing
 in


these
 perfect
 time
 frames,
 he's
 off
 by


like
 a
 legit
 month.
 Like


the
 the
 line
 should
 be
 pushed
 like
 it


wouldn't
 look
 that
 coincidental
 if
 he


actually
 had
 lined
 it
 up
 to
 the
 2018


high.
 Yeah.
 Right
 there
 where
 you
 had


the
 red
 bar.
 He
 said
 that's
 the
 draw


down.
 Right.
 That's
 not
 Well,
 I
 mean
 it


is
 the
 draw
 down,
 but
 it's
 also
 the


runup
 as
 well.
 It's
 the
 whole
 cycle


right
 where
 you
 have
 it
 right
 there.


That's
 the
 whole
 cycle.


>> But
 isn't
 that
 his
 point?
 Is
 that
 from


the
 top
 to
 the
 bottom?
 Like
 because
 he's


using
 the
 same
 in
 2021
 where
 it's
 green


right
 there.
 He's
 using
 the
 same
 thing.


>> I
 But
 that
 what
 does
 that
 even
 mean?
 If


he's
 not
 calling
 if
 he's
 not
 saying
 that


the
 runup
 takes
 a,50
 days
 and
 then
 the


draw
 down
 takes
 two
 364
 days,
 what
 is
 he


even
 saying?
 Somewhere
 in
 the
 next
 364


days
 it
 can
 run
 up
 another
 100%
 and
 also


find
 a
 bottom.
 Is
 that
 what
 he's
 saying


that
 there's
 no
 there's
 no
 information


to
 take
 away
 from
 that?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 he's
 saying
 and
 I
 so
 I


think
 your
 point
 is
 that
 the,54
 days
 is


also
 including
 the
 364
 days.
 That


overlap
 is
 what
 you're
 annoyed
 by.
 And
 I


think
 that's
 a
 fair
 point
 because
 he's


saying
 we
 peaked
 in
 August
 and
 so
 or


sorry,
 we
 peaked
 October
 6th
 and
 now


we're
 starting
 the
 364
 day
 decline.


That's
 how
 he
 gets
 October
 4th
 for
 next


year.
 But
 your
 point
 is
 that
 in
 the
 past


cycles
 he's
 been
 off
 by
 a
 couple
 months.


But
 even
 if
 it
 was
 off
 by
 a
 couple


months,
 maybe
 the
 bottom
 is
 then


September
 26
 or
 August
 26,
 but
 it
 would


still
 be
 in
 the
 same
 time
 frame,
 right?


>> Yeah,
 I
 know.
 But
 but but
 what
 it
 could


also
 mean
 is
 that
 we
 run
 up
 an


additional
 100%.


In
 that
 364
 days,


>> but
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 happened
 in
 the


past
 two
 cycles.


>> It


go
 look
 at
 it


>> like
 being
 off
 a
 couple.
 No,
 no.
 So,
 so


the
 2018
 one,
 it's
 not
 right
 before
 it


took
 off.
 I
 remember
 2017
 when
 it's
 like


>> from
 what
 I'm
 looking
 at
 on
 the
 picture,


it
 looks
 like
 it's
 blended
 within
 it.
 I


I
 see
 your
 point
 though.
 I
 get
 why


you're
 saying
 it's
 not
 the
 best


description
 of
 it.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look.
 Okay.
 So,
 may
 maybe


there
 is
 a
 runup
 coming
 up.


>> Love
 Andre
 J.
 I've
 got
 nothing
 against


this.
 I
 just
 um
 I
 I
 find
 people
 just


look
 to
 the
 stars
 and
 they
 go,
 "Oh,
 you


know,
 everyone
 now,
 you
 guys
 are
 okay
 to


sell
 your
 Bitcoin
 because
 it's


guaranteed
 in
 the
 stars
 that
 we're
 going


to
 run
 down
 from
 here
 all
 the
 way
 to
 new


all-time
 lows


>> or
 at least


>> I
 I
 agree.
 That's
 stupid.


>> Good
 luck
 with
 that."


>> Yeah.


>> You
 know,
 but
 um


yeah,
 I
 I
 don't
 know.
 Anyway,
 I'm


>> Well,
 let
 me
 let
 me
 let
 me
 just
 ask
 you


this.
 Let
 me
 ask
 you
 this
 thing,
 then


I'll
 let
 you
 leave.
 Do
 you
 think
 the


institutionalization
 of
 Bitcoin
 makes


the
 cycle
 different?
 Like,
 do
 or
 do
 you


think
 it
 breaks
 the
 cycle
 or
 No.


>> Um,


you
 know,
 I
 I
 have
 a
 hard
 time
 knowing


where
 Bitcoin
 is
 going
 to
 go.
 Uh,
 I
 I've


got
 a
 much
 bigger
 belief
 in
 Ethereum


right
 now,
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 that


there's
 a
 four-year
 cycle
 on
 Ethereum.


It
 doesn't
 make
 sense.
 There's
 no


having.
 Uh
 I
 I
 do
 think
 that
 the
 having


events
 does
 cause
 a
 cycle
 on
 Bitcoin.
 I


mean
 there
 there's
 real
 reason
 for
 me
 to


believe
 that.
 But
 the


institutionalization
 of
 it,


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 I
 just
 think
 maybe
 it's


more
 buyers
 and
 and
 and
 actually
 just


makes
 the
 market
 larger.
 Like
 every


cycle
 we're
 adding
 on
 essentially
 uh


another
 trillion
 dollars
 of
 market
 cap.


before
 it
 was
 uh
 individuals,
 then


companies,
 then
 governments,
 and


potentially
 central
 banks
 one
 day.


But
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that
 changes
 the


cycle.
 It
 just,
 you
 know,
 allows
 us
 to


hit
 sort
 of
 higher
 highs.
 Um,
 I'm
 a


believer
 in
 Bitcoin.
 I'm
 a
 believer
 in


the
 companies
 that
 bet
 on
 Bitcoin
 like


or
 or
 benefit
 from
 Bitcoin.
 So,
 uh,


Coinbase
 or
 Robin
 Hood
 or
 these
 sort
 of


names.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 I'd
 be
 much
 more


worried
 about
 our
 hood
 positions
 if


>> you
 know
 we're
 going
 to
 head
 back
 down


to
 all-time
 lows.


>> I
 agree
 it.
 That's
 what
 I'm
 saying.
 I


don't
 want
 Andre
 to
 be
 right
 about
 this.


I
 just
 thought
 it
 was
 interesting.
 It's


funny
 how
 how
 pol
 50%
 of
 the
 people


agree
 with
 you.
 50%
 disagree.
 It's
 quite


incredible
 how
 polarized
 people
 are
 on


the
 cyclical
 nature
 of
 this.
 I
 I
 I
 agree


with
 you
 though.
 I
 don't
 think
 Ethereum


should
 have
 a
 cycle.
 However,
 I
 also


don't
 think
 Ethereum
 just
 blows
 back
 to


4,500
 if
 Bitcoin
 doesn't
 cooperate


because
 I
 think
 they
 are
 intertwined.


Same
 thing
 with
 Salana,
 XRP,
 etc.
 So,
 I


guess
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 over
 the
 coming


years.


>> Yeah,
 man.
 But,
 um,
 interesting
 things.


I'm
 very
 I'm
 still
 very
 bullish
 on
 this


market.
 I'm
 a
 better
 on
 on
 AI
 and,
 uh,


you
 know,
 finance
 in
 general
 and
 and


blockchain's
 a
 big
 part
 of
 that


advertising.
 Dude,
 we
 need
 to
 have
 a


conversation
 about
 Reddit
 if
 you're
 deep


diving
 on
 Reddit
 because
 I'm
 loving
 that


name
 right
 now.
 I'm
 loving
 Meta.
 I
 think


a
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 are
 really


interesting.


>> I'm
 deep
 diving
 into
 it.
 I
 don't
 love


Reddit's
 valuation,
 but
 the
 growth
 is


pulling
 me
 towards
 being
 more
 bullish,


but
 yes,
 we
 should
 definitely
 talk
 about


it.


>> Yeah,
 but
 you've
 been
 able
 to
 to
 stomach


some
 valuations
 in
 your
 time,
 so
 maybe


you
 can
 get
 through
 it.


>> That's
 true.


>> All
 right,
 man.


>> All right.
 Thank
 you,
 Tanner.
 Tanner's


Twitter
 in
 the
 chat.
 talk
 later.


>> Bye.


>> I
 actually
 am
 starting
 to
 like
 Reddit,


but
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 know if
 you


pay
 that
 much
 of
 a
 premium
 for
 Reddit's


growth.
 But
 then
 again,
 they
 are
 they


are
 the
 fastest
 advertising
 growth
 name


in
 the
 entire
 well
 outside
 of
 Apploven.


Apploven's
 faster
 than.
 But
 yeah,
 that


deep
 dive
 on
 Reddit
 probably
 will
 be
 out


on
 Saturday
 as
 I've
 been
 looking
 more


into
 them.
 AMC
 right
 there
 3704.
 That's


up
 1.7.
 Oracle
 is
 back
 above
 200.
 AMD


goes
 green
 and
 Nvidia's
 green.
 S&P
 are


we
 back
 at
 680?


We
 are
 back
 at
 681.


All
 right.
 So,
 crypto
 lagging,
 not


hurting
 the
 S&P.
 The
 S&P
 is
 barely
 down


even
 though
 Bitcoin's
 down
 a
 lot
 more.


So,
 maybe
 the
 markets
 are
 diverging
 a


little
 bit
 away
 from


crypto
 as
 the
 core
 indicator.
 That's


what
 it
 felt
 like
 in
 the
 pre-markets.


Um,


and
 then
 you've
 got
 big
 tech
 starting
 to


go
 green.
 Meta
 continuing
 its
 momentum


from
 last
 week.
 It's
 basically
 at
 600


most
 of
 last
 week
 and
 then
 it
 bounced
 up


on
 Tuesday
 and
 Wednesday
 and
 now
 you're


here
 at
 645


on
 Meta.


Yeah,
 ASML
 definitely
 another
 big
 one
 to


uh
 to
 do
 some
 research
 in.
 Reddit
 could


be
 in
 the
 S&P
 500.
 That
 is
 also
 true.


They
 have
 a
 potential
 date
 with
 the
 S&P.


Same
 with
 SoFi.
 Oh,
 we're
 going to
 get


that
 announcement
 this
 Friday.
 Okay,
 so


December
 5th,
 we're
 going
 to
 know
 this


Friday
 who
 gets
 in.
 I
 mean,
 it
 would
 be


kind
 of
 crazy
 if
 SoFi
 and
 Reddit
 got
 in.


That
 would
 be
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 way
 to
 end
 the


year.
 Where
 is
 SoFi?
 We
 got
 one
 month


left
 for
 SoFi
 to
 get
 that
 $30
 close.


Uh,
 and
 then
 it's
 got
 about
 three
 months


to
 get
 above
 45
 for
 Nod
 to
 get
 paid.
 The


rate
 cut
 is
 incredibly
 bullish
 for
 SoFi.


I
 do
 think
 that
 a
 $30
 close
 is
 not


crazy.
 Oaklo
 down
 2%
 on
 the
 day.
 Nvidia


still
 179,


but
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 how
 it


closes
 by
 the
 end
 of
 this
 month.
 The


these
 are
 really
 the
 last
 31
 days.


That's
 it.
 There's
 only
 like
 what
 20


trading
 days.
 So,
 we've
 got
 basically
 20


to
 22
 days
 left
 for
 this
 market
 to
 give


us


its
 return
 for
 2025.
 And
 you
 know
 this


the
 sort
 of
 fund
 manager
 chasing
 thesis


potentially
 goes
 into
 effect.
 The
 um
 the


tax
 loss
 harvesting
 thesis
 for
 December


goes
 into
 I
 mean
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


different
 narratives
 that
 flow
 out.
 I


was
 looking
 at
 some
 data
 last
 night.
 On


average
 December
 is
 up
 about
 1.2
 to


1.5%.


75%
 of
 the
 time.


So
 maybe


we
 are
 part
 of
 that
 75%.
 And
 if
 we
 are


um


you
 know
 you
 need
 two
 and
 a
 half%
 to
 get


7,000
 but
 maybe
 that
 ends
 up
 playing
 out


towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 It
 would


not
 surprise
 me
 if
 Nvidia
 gaps
 up
 to
 200


by
 end
 of
 year
 either
 and
 people
 are


just
 like
 this
 is
 too
 cheap.
 But
 you
 can


tell
 Jensen
 was
 annoyed
 today
 as
 well
 at


having
 to
 constantly
 explain
 why
 Nvidia


is
 real.


And
 so
 there
 might
 be
 some
 more
 pain


from
 a
 narrative
 perspective
 to
 get


there.


And
 then
 we
 enter
 2026


and
 we're
 gonna
 have
 to
 see
 how
 2026


plays
 out.
 Chime
 is
 up
 today
 as
 well.


Tanner
 did
 pitch
 this
 on
 uh
 the
 show
 we


had
 on
 Wednesday
 for
 uh
 for
 Equity
 Edge.


It
 was
 a
 audio
 show
 on
 Twitter
 and
 he


did
 pitch
 chime.
 Chime
 right
 there
 up


7.19%


as
 that
 goes
 green.
 Coinbase
 still
 down


5%.
 Reddit
 up
 two
 and
 then
 S&P
 making
 a


move
 right
 here.
 A
 dollar
 away


potentially
 green
 on
 the
 day.


TTD
 is
 green
 as
 well.
 That's
 correct.


Uh
 Muna,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Thoughts
 on
 strategy
 CEO
 saying
 they


might
 sell
 Bitcoin
 if
 MNA
 falls
 below


one
 kind
 of
 contradicts
 his
 chairman


Sailor
 and
 might
 scare
 creditors.
 So


they
 put
 out
 a
 22-minute
 video
 today.
 Uh


and
 I
 think
 that's
 where
 you're
 getting


the
 quote
 from
 the
 strategy
 CEO
 saying


they
 might
 sell
 Bitcoin.
 I
 think
 they


legally
 have
 to
 say
 that.
 I
 mean,
 I


think
 there's
 a
 world
 in
 which
 they


could,
 but
 legally
 they
 have
 to
 disclose


that
 this
 is
 a
 risk
 to
 our
 Bitcoin


holdings,
 uh,
 which
 is
 that
 we
 might


need
 to
 sell
 it
 in
 order
 to
 do
 something


else.
 Now,
 ultimately,
 I
 think
 Sailor


makes
 the
 final
 call
 on
 if
 they
 sell
 or


not
 or
 don't.
 And
 based
 on
 what
 Sailor


has
 historically
 said,
 I
 doubt
 they


would
 sell
 unless
 it
 gets
 that
 bad.


And
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know.
 Sailor
 said


Bitcoin
 could
 go
 to
 a
 freaking
 dollar


and
 he
 wouldn't
 sell
 it.
 So,
 you
 know,


maybe
 he's
 just
 saying
 that
 or
 maybe
 he


really
 has
 done
 some
 financial


engineering
 based
 on
 how
 the
 preferred


equities
 were


uh
 divided
 and
 how
 they
 were
 distributed


for
 him
 to
 never
 have
 to
 really
 sell
 it.


Micro
 Strategy
 down
 10.85%.


And
 so,
 if
 that's
 the
 case,
 they


probably
 just
 had
 to
 say
 it
 in
 that
 uh


in
 that
 video.
 US
 Atlanta
 Fed
 GDP
 for


Q3.


Did
 we
 just
 get
 that?


They
 didn't
 give
 it
 last
 week.


Um,


is
 that
 right?
 Are
 we
 at
 3.9%.


Yeah,
 3.9.
 That's
 the
 estimate.
 So,


that's
 not
 the
 official
 GDP
 reading.
 We


were
 supposed
 to
 get
 that
 a
 couple
 weeks


ago,
 but
 this
 is
 the
 estimate.
 Atlanta


Fed
 now
 projecting
 3.9.


Look,
 if
 we
 end
 up
 holding
 on
 to
 4%
 for


the
 next,
 you
 guys
 know
 Japan
 grew
 GDP


by
 5%
 for
 15
 years
 from
 the
 60s
 to
 70s.


Like
 I've
 been
 because
 of
 this
 whole
 yen


carry
 trade.
 I've
 been
 looking
 a
 lot


more
 into
 Japan's
 history
 and
 my


goodness
 I
 if
 if
 it
 was
 built
 if
 it
 was


manufactured
 in
 the
 60s,
 70s
 and
 80s,
 it


came
 from
 Japan.
 Japan
 at
 one
 point
 was


close
 to
 overtaking
 the
 United
 States
 in


GDP
 and
 that's
 when
 you
 had
 the
 United


States
 president,
 the
 fans,
 the
 France


president,
 the
 UK
 president,
 you
 had
 a


lot
 of the
 Western
 allies
 come
 together


and
 they
 uh
 well
 they
 basically
 told


Japan
 the
 yen
 was
 250
 to
 one
 against
 the


dollar.
 Right
 now
 it's
 at
 like
 140


150ish.


They
 basically
 started
 artificially


deflating
 the
 yen
 against
 the
 dollar


because
 you
 know
 one
 of
 their
 biggest


allies
 was
 like
 hey
 dude
 we
 cannot
 have


this
 yen
 as
 high
 as
 it
 is
 and
 and
 and


ironically
 that's
 what
 ended
 up
 starting


the
 lost
 decade
 for
 Japan
 where


everything
 just
 fell
 apart
 but
 man
 did


they
 compound
 their
 GDP
 growth
 back
 in


the
 day
 and
 so
 if
 the
 United
 States
 at


the
 level
 that
 we
 are
 can
 get
 anywhere


near
 4%
 for
 the
 next
 few
 years
 which
 is


asking
 a
 lot


it
 would
 be
 very
 exciting.
 Very


very
 exciting
 if
 we
 can
 get
 there.
 Amcor


continuing
 to
 get
 a
 good
 bid
 right


there.
 3720
 that's
 up
 2.2%
 again
 very


tied
 to
 Broadcom.
 Still
 trading
 at
 a


pretty
 reasonable
 multiple
 as
 well.
 A


little
 bit
 over
 onetime
 sales.
 So
 that


that
 to
 me
 is
 a
 long
 for
 2026.
 Nokia
 613


that's
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 on
 the
 day.


Bitcoin
 still
 84.2.


Duolingo
 190.
 Silver
 continuing
 to
 go


higher.
 Bitmine
 not
 low
 of
 the
 day
 but


pretty
 close
 at
 29.25
 25
 lows
 at
 28
 as


Ethereum
 tries
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 2700.
 But


Ethereum
 pretty
 close
 to
 the
 low
 of
 day


as
 well
 at
 2719.


Did
 we
 get
 below
 2700?
 Yeah,
 we
 got
 to


2625
 on
 November
 21st,


which
 was
 an
 ugly
 day
 for
 everybody.


So
 hopefully
 we
 stay
 above


those
 levels.


Um,


Nvidia,
 are
 we
 going
 red?


Well,
 we're
 down
 from
 180.


Okay.
 So,
 I
 think
 the
 next
 catalyst
 now


for
 this
 market
 because
 we've
 kind
 of


run
 out
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 catalysts
 given


earnings
 are
 done
 is
 the
 Fed
 meeting.


And
 I
 wonder
 how
 much
 activity
 or
 how


much
 the
 trend
 really
 changes
 until
 we


get
 that
 decision.
 Although,
 everyone


probably
 is
 going
 to
 start
 to
 price
 in


the
 decision.
 Again,
 S&P
 really
 not
 that


far
 off
 from
 all-time
 highs.
 So,


although
 the
 high
 beta
 stocks
 have
 taken


a
 hit,
 it's
 not
 like
 the
 S&P
 500
 has


really


been
 destroyed.
 You
 know,
 even
 if
 it
 was


at
 670,
 that
 would
 still
 be
 2%
 off
 from


alltime
 highs.
 Now,
 it's
 less
 than
 1%.


So,
 question
 is,
 can
 we
 just
 hold
 on
 to


these
 levels?


I
 think
 that's
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 have


to
 see
 over
 the
 coming
 weeks
 until
 we


get
 the
 uh
 rate
 cut
 catalyst.
 On
 top
 of


that,
 you
 have
 um
 again
 a
 pal
 speaking


at
 8
 p.m.
 today
 at
 Stanford.
 I
 don't


think
 he's
 going
 to
 say
 anything
 too


crazy
 for
 the
 markets.
 Also,
 Japan
 is


announcing
 a
 rate
 cut
 decision
 tonight,


right?


Uh
 I'm
 pretty
 sure
 it's
 tonight.
 It
 is


on


No,
 sorry.
 It's
 December
 19th.
 Okay.
 So,


that's
 likely
 going
 to
 be
 a
 hike.


It's
 like
 85%
 probabilities
 that's
 a


hike.


Which
 again,
 I
 gotta
 study
 more
 about


Japanese
 monetary
 policy.
 But


I
 just
 logically
 I
 don't
 understand
 why


they're
 printing
 $150
 billion
 and
 then


hiking
 rates
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 Like
 and


and
 this
 is
 a
 trend
 with
 Japan,
 dude.


Again,
 I've
 been
 on
 this
 whole
 Japanese


binge,
 but
 in
 the
 90s
 they
 did
 the
 same


[ __ ]
 they
 would
 like
 do
 something


that's
 like
 stimulative
 and
 then
 they


would
 introduce
 new
 taxes
 and
 hike
 rates


and
 and
 and
 until
 they
 finally
 stepped


in
 around
 the
 dotcom
 bubble
 and
 started


lowering
 rates.
 It
 was
 just
 like
 what


was
 the
 point
 of
 raising
 rates
 and
 I


think
 they're
 trying
 to
 find
 a
 balance


between
 stimulus
 and
 inflation.
 And


realistically
 now
 here's
 a
 deeper


conversation.
 This
 is
 the
 conversation


no
 one
 wants
 to
 have
 on
 Japan.
 This
 is


the
 conversation
 no
 one
 wants
 to
 have.


Japan's
 actually
 struggling
 on
 a


population
 crisis.
 Now,
 the
 conventional


conversation
 is
 um
 people
 in
 Japan


aren't
 having
 that
 many
 kids.
 Sure,


that's
 that's
 like
 the
 legit
 people
 in


America
 aren't
 having
 that
 many
 kids.


The
 actual
 problem
 is
 Japan
 doesn't


really
 want
 immigrants.
 In
 fact,
 the


reason
 the
 old
 prime
 minister
 had
 to


resign
 out
 of
 shame
 is
 because
 he
 wanted


to
 bring
 in
 500,000
 Nigerians
 and


Indians
 into
 Japan
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 a


lot
 of
 the
 work
 that
 the
 working
 class


of
 Japan
 isn't
 really
 doing.
 Partly


because
 of
 uh
 cultural
 shifts,
 but
 also


partly
 because
 they're
 getting
 older.


It's
 not
 easy
 for
 someone
 who's
 75
 years


old
 to
 do
 manual
 labor.
 And
 then,
 you


know,
 the
 Japanese
 population
 rejected


that
 wholeheartedly.
 And
 I
 learned
 a
 lot


about
 this
 when
 Amir
 came
 to
 visit


because
 Amamir's
 wife
 is
 actually


Japanese.
 He's
 moving
 to
 Japan
 from


Sweden.
 So


everything
 he's
 been
 saying
 lines
 up


with
 the
 research
 that
 I've
 been
 doing.


Like
 the
 Japanese
 people
 do
 not
 want


that
 many.
 It's
 not
 the
 melting
 pot
 that


America
 is.
 And
 so
 the
 literally
 the


reason
 the
 PM
 prime
 minister
 resigned
 a


month
 and
 a
 half
 ago
 is
 out
 of
 I
 he
 was


like, "Oh,
 he
 had
 to
 resign
 out
 of


shame."
 And
 I
 was
 like
 like
 you
 know
 how


many
 things
 Trump
 has
 said
 that
 would


make
 him
 resign
 out
 of
 shame?
 I
 was


like, "What
 are
 you
 talking?"
 He's
 like,


"No,
 Japan's
 different,
 dude.
 If
 you
 do


something
 that
 angers
 the
 people
 to
 that


extent,
 you
 have
 to
 resign
 out
 of


shame."
 He
 still
 had
 two
 years
 on
 his


term.
 I
 was
 like,
 "I've
 never
 heard
 of


that."
 But,
 uh,
 that's
 what
 he
 did.


That's
 when
 you
 got
 this
 new
 this
 new


prime
 minister
 said
 she's
 going
 to
 print


money
 and
 she's
 not
 going
 to
 let
 any


immigrants
 come
 into
 the
 country.
 Not


not
 literally.
 Like,
 obviously
 people


can
 travel,
 but
 like,
 you
 know,
 you're


not
 going
 to
 have
 mass
 immigration


coming
 in.
 And
 that's
 how
 she
 got


elected.


So
 the
 thing
 is
 when
 Japanese
 people


stop
 when
 when
 the
 Japanese
 population


starts
 growing
 stops
 growing
 at
 an


exponential
 pace
 which
 it's
 already
 been


for
 the
 past
 10
 years
 and
 everyone
 gets


old
 and
 can't
 do
 manual
 labor
 who's


going
 to
 do
 the
 work


like
 if
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 other


people
 come
 into
 the
 country.
 So
 it's


like
 that's
 the
 broader
 philosophical


question
 on
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 their


economy.


And
 in
 the
 meantime
 they're
 printing


money
 and
 raising
 rates
 and
 that's


messing
 up
 the
 yen
 carry
 trade
 and


that's
 affecting
 all
 of
 us.


So,
 robots.
 Okay.
 You
 know,
 that's


that's
 actually
 a
 this
 is
 what
 Elon
 said


on
 the
 podcast
 this
 weekend.
 He
 was


like,
 "The
 only
 way
 to
 grow
 ourselves


out
 of
 this
 deficit
 is
 AI
 and
 robotics."


So,
 so
 may
 maybe
 that's
 the
 answer.


Maybe
 that
 is
 the
 answer.


But
 it
 also
 depends
 on,
 you
 know,
 how


aggressive


uh
 robotics
 is
 going
 to
 be.


This
 is
 uh
 this
 is
 what
 Elon
 was
 saying


about
 the
 the
 deficit.


>> Oops,
 you
 couldn't
 hear
 it.
 Sorry.


>> Productivity
 to
 increase
 the
 goods
 and


services
 faster
 than
 the
 increase
 in
 the


money
 supply.
 So
 incre
 the
 US
 is


increasing
 money
 supply
 quite


substantially
 with
 you
 know
 deficits


that
 are
 on
 the
 order
 of
 $2
 trillion.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 so
 so
 you
 have
 to
 have
 um


you
 know
 goods
 and
 services
 output


increase
 more
 than
 that
 in
 order
 to
 not


have
 inflation.
 So
 we're
 not
 there
 yet.


But
 if
 you
 say
 like
 like
 how
 long
 would


it
 take
 us
 to
 get
 there?
 I
 think
 it's
 3


years


probably
 3
 years
 before


in
 3
 years
 or
 less


my
 my
 guess
 is
 goods
 and
 services
 output


will
 exceed
 the
 rate
 of
 inflation
 like


money


>> that
 that
 is
 crazy
 what
 he
 just
 said
 and


we
 know
 Elon
 with
 his
 timelines
 but
 in


three
 years


if
 GDP
 is
 outpacing


inflation


I
 mean
 like
 that
 is
 why
 he's
 on
 this


whole
 riff
 about
 people
 don't
 have
 to


work
 again
 because
 everything's
 going
 to


collapse
 to
 basically
 zero
 when
 it
 comes


to
 the
 abundance
 of
 goods
 and
 services


we're
 going
 to
 have.
 Now,
 is
 that


realistic?
 I
 don't
 know.
 But
 I
 mean,
 if


that
 happens,
 deflation
 will
 be
 the


problem,
 not
 inflation.


>> Services
 growth
 will
 exceed
 money
 money


supply
 growth
 in
 about
 three
 years.


>> Maybe
 after
 those
 three
 years,
 you
 have


deflation
 and
 then
 interest
 rates
 go
 to


zero
 and
 then
 the
 debt
 is
 a
 smaller


problem
 than
 it
 is.


>> Yes.


>> Right.


>> That's
 most
 likely
 the
 case.


I
 mean,
 again,
 dude,
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 if


that's
 how
 it's
 going
 to
 play
 out.
 I
 I'm


pretty
 skeptical
 that
 in
 three
 years


that
 happens,
 but
 if
 that
 does
 happen
 in


three
 years,
 just
 imagine,


first
 of
 all,
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 to


Tesla's
 stock
 price?
 Because,
 you
 know,


part
 of
 the
 reason
 Elon's
 saying
 this
 is


because
 he
 thinks
 that
 Tesla's
 going to


be
 a
 major
 contributor
 in
 outputting
 all


the
 goods
 and
 services.
 In
 this
 case,


robots
 is
 probably
 going
 to
 be
 the


biggest
 output
 to
 uh
 create
 that


deflation.
 But
 like
 the
 stock
 market


should
 be
 much
 higher
 than
 it
 is
 today


in
 three
 years
 if
 that's
 how
 it's
 going


to
 play
 out
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 growth


is
 going
 to
 come
 down
 to
 corporate


earnings.
 A
 lot
 of
 that
 growth
 is
 going


to
 be
 reutilized
 in
 buybacks
 which
 are


going
 to
 keep
 those
 stocks
 a
 float
 and


you
 don't
 you
 don't
 get
 that
 type
 of
 GDP


growth
 unless
 you
 have
 margin


productivity
 as
 he
 was
 talking
 about


earlier
 which
 ultimately
 benefit


shareholders.
 Now,
 I
 don't
 know what


that
 means
 for
 the
 labor
 market.
 And
 you


have
 the
 obvious
 sort
 of
 paradoxical


bare
 case
 where
 if
 the
 labor
 market


collapses,
 then
 you
 know,
 everything


collapses
 because
 people
 don't
 have


money
 and
 to
 to
 buy
 all
 these
 products


and
 goods
 and
 services.
 But
 but
 Elon's


point
 is
 like
 money
 is
 not
 going
 to


matter,
 which
 again
 I
 don't
 fully
 agree


with.
 But
 it
 would
 be
 an
 entirely
 new


paradigm
 to
 to
 think
 of
 how
 we
 evaluate


consumption
 in
 an
 economy
 with
 that
 much


deflation.


But
 you
 definitely
 need
 the
 bots
 to
 play


a
 role
 there.
 Wow.
 Silver
 all-time
 highs


again
 today.
 My
 goodness.
 58.1
 on


silver.
 That's
 up
 3%


on
 the
 day.
 Officially
 an
 all-time
 high.


Gold
 still
 at
 4234.


Dude,
 silver
 is
 up
 95%
 this
 year.


I
 mean,


who
 would
 have
 thought
 silver


gold
 is
 still
 freaking
 up
 70%.
 No,
 60%


59.8%.


A
 lot
 of
 that
 money
 is
 leaving
 crypto


going
 to
 silver
 and
 gold,


which
 is
 also
 wild
 because,
 you
 know,


young
 people,
 I
 would
 say,
 are
 not


easily
 excited
 by
 gold
 and
 silver.


They're
 more
 excited
 by
 these
 crypto


products.
 But
 as
 soon
 as
 those
 products


stop
 generating
 returns,
 it
 doesn't


matter
 your
 age,
 people
 stop
 getting


excited
 real
 quick.
 And
 that's


definitely
 a
 threat
 over
 the
 next
 year


that


people
 are
 going
 to
 have
 to
 look
 at.


Bitcoin
 still
 down
 84,
 potentially


losing
 that
 again.
 And
 then
 Nvidia
 now


losing
 180,
 back
 down
 to
 178.


Man,
 how
 are
 people
 going
 to
 earn
 a


living
 when
 robots
 and
 AI
 do
 everything?


I
 don't
 know.
 Now
 again,
 I
 also
 don't


want
 to
 sound
 super
 doomeristic
 and


think
 like
 everyone's
 losing
 their
 jobs


in
 five
 years.
 Like
 I
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 happening,
 but
 we
 can't
 ignore


all
 the
 data
 that
 we've
 been
 seeing


about
 college
 grads
 and
 white
 collar


jobs
 starting
 to
 go
 away.
 I
 don't
 think


AI
 and
 robots
 are
 going
 to
 do


everything,
 but
 they're
 going
 to
 do
 a


lot.
 And
 the
 question
 is,
 does
 that
 open


up
 a
 new
 job
 market,
 but
 I'm
 also


skeptical
 of
 that
 because
 like
 the


internet
 opened
 up
 all
 these


opportunities
 and
 everyone's
 like,
 oh,


humans
 always
 figure
 it
 out.
 But
 no


one's
 actually
 answering
 what
 is
 AI


going
 to
 create
 in
 terms
 of
 job


opportunities.
 Like
 no
 one's
 answering


that
 question.
 Everyone's
 just
 like,


"Oh,
 we
 always
 figure
 it
 out.
 We
 always


make
 new
 jobs.
 Like
 this
 is
 how
 humans,


you
 know,
 evolve."
 I'm
 like,
 "Yeah,
 but


the
 internet,
 it
 was
 quite
 obvious,


even
 a
 couple
 years
 after
 the
 internet,


that
 it
 would
 democratize
 information,


which
 would
 inevitably
 lead
 to
 massive,


massive
 business
 models
 that
 could
 be


created
 on
 top
 of
 that
 that
 needed
 those


jobs.
 We
 never
 had
 something
 that
 was


replacing
 human
 intelligence
 to
 the


point
 where
 it's
 democratizing


information
 but
 it's
 also
 commoditizing


the
 value
 of
 creativity
 within
 the


information
 because
 a
 large
 language


model
 for
 example
 just
 gives
 you
 the


answer
 or
 the
 robot
 just
 automates
 the


the
 physical
 labor.


So
 I
 I
 I
 think
 the
 question
 then
 becomes


a
 broader
 philosophical
 argument
 about


how
 does
 AI
 enhance
 jobs?


Now
 again
 Chad's
 link
 right
 there.


Pounder
 has
 taken
 a
 pretty
 explicit


approach
 to
 this
 as
 you
 can
 see
 on
 the


link
 that
 he
 has
 right
 there
 which
 is


and
 Karp
 has
 been
 talking
 about
 this
 for


a
 long
 time
 right
 the
 idea
 that
 hey


uh
 if
 you
 actually
 believe
 in
 AI
 then


there
 is
 a
 world
 where
 AI
 can
 be
 used
 to


help
 people
 and
 can
 be
 a
 motivating


force
 for
 human
 labor
 motivating
 force


for
 human
 agency


and
 also
 be
 something
 that
 doesn't


necessarily
 replace
 you
 but
 enhances


your
 autonomy


I
 I
 think
 the
 push
 back
 to
 that
 is
 what


happens
 when
 someone
 loses
 their
 job
 in


a
 factory.
 Like
 if
 you're
 an
 Amazon


worker,
 you've
 been
 an
 Amazon
 worker
 for


the
 past
 five
 years
 and
 they
 come
 up
 to


you
 and
 they
 say,
 "We
 don't
 need
 you


because
 a
 robot
 is
 going
 to
 be
 doing


what
 you're
 doing."
 Which
 we've
 seen
 the


leaked
 memos.
 Amazon's
 already
 been


discussing
 how
 they're
 going
 to
 market


their,
 you
 know,
 new
 age
 of
 robotics


because
 they
 know
 the
 PR
 is
 going
 to
 be


disgusting
 when
 they
 fire
 millions
 of


people.
 Like
 like
 like
 what
 happens
 to


those
 jobs?
 What
 happens
 to
 those


people?


What
 happens
 when
 you
 know
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 robo
 taxis
 and
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 pick


an
 Uber
 up
 which
 again
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 going
 to
 happen
 for
 a
 while
 like
 I


don't
 think
 self-driving
 is
 there
 yet


but
 when
 it
 when
 that
 is
 the
 case
 where


you
 call
 a
 robo
 taxi
 you
 don't
 have
 to


call
 an
 Uber
 driver
 what
 is
 the
 job
 that


the
 Uber
 driver
 Uber
 driver
 does.
 So
 you


have
 other
 companies
 that
 are
 working


from
 a
 hey
 like
 how
 here's
 how
 we


empower
 you
 which
 is
 how
 Pounder
 has


talked
 a
 lot
 about
 AI
 in
 the
 factory
 AI


in
 the
 workplace
 AI
 in
 the
 enterprise
 AI


in
 the
 hospital
 and
 then
 you
 have
 other


companies
 that
 are
 straight
 up
 like


where
 you're
 you're
 going to
 be
 replaced


and
 they're
 all
 but
 explicitly
 admitting


it.


And
 those
 are
 I
 think
 you
 know
 the


broader
 questions
 that
 we're
 going
 to


have
 to
 figure
 out.
 Are
 robots
 going
 to


pay
 taxes?
 I
 do
 not
 think
 the
 robots
 are


going
 to
 pay
 taxes.
 I
 think
 the


companies
 deploying
 those
 robots
 might


get
 a
 fat
 robot
 tax
 on
 them
 at
 some


point.


But
 I
 don't
 know
 like
 again
 if
 if
 you've


been
 if
 you've
 been
 driving
 Uber
 for
 the


past
 10
 years,
 if
 you've
 been
 working
 at


an
 Amazon
 factory
 for
 the
 past
 10
 or


you've
 been
 a
 UPS
 driver,
 like
 if
 that


goes
 away,
 the
 question
 is
 how
 quickly


can
 you
 develop
 a
 new
 skill?
 How
 quickly


is
 there
 going
 to
 be
 a
 new
 job
 opening


if
 that
 skill
 does
 go
 away?
 or
 if
 the


skill
 is
 just
 not
 needed
 as
 much
 and


then
 what
 will
 the
 emphasis
 on
 society


be?
 I
 mean
 like
 obviously
 AI
 is
 putting


an
 emphasis
 on
 creativity.
 Even
 Karp
 has


talked
 about
 this
 that
 in
 their
 hiring


process
 at
 Hounder
 they're
 really


focused
 on
 if
 you're
 a
 creative
 person


because
 you
 could
 be
 a
 good
 engineer.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 good
 engineers.
 Are
 you


creative
 enough
 to
 be
 a
 problem
 solver?


Because
 in
 the
 world
 of
 AI
 if
 you
 can


you
 know
 my
 my
 cousin
 she
 was
 working
 uh


at
 at
 the
 house
 yesterday
 and
 she
 was


showing
 me
 she
 she
 uses
 anthropic.
 Her


company
 pays
 for
 like
 the
 highest
 level


of
 subscription
 you
 could
 pay
 for


anthropic.
 has
 like
 a
 limited
 amount
 of


tokens
 every
 month
 that
 she's
 able
 to


use.
 And
 she
 was
 showing
 me
 the


anthropic
 the
 claw
 code
 literally
 uh


digesting
 the
 context
 file
 that
 she
 was


giving
 it
 to
 then
 begin
 working.
 And
 I'm


just
 looking
 at
 this
 thing
 and
 she's


like
 if
 we
 didn't
 have
 this
 the
 update


that
 our
 team
 is
 pushing
 that
 we're


working
 on
 would
 take
 another
 three


months.
 And
 I
 was
 like
 are
 you
 serious


or
 are
 you
 bullshitting
 me?
 Like
 like


are
 you
 lit?
 She
 was
 like
 no
 we
 like
 if


we
 did
 not
 have
 this
 we
 would
 not
 be


able
 to
 push
 this
 product
 out
 for


another
 three
 months.


And
 so
 I'm
 like
 okay.
 So
 there
 there's


like
 legit
 productivity
 gains
 in
 this


sector
 and
 you've
 got
 to
 be
 very


creative
 when
 you
 have
 a
 clawed
 engineer


assistant
 that's
 helping
 you
 even
 if


it's
 not
 replacing
 you.
 But
 what
 happens


when
 creativity
 could
 get
 commoditized


to
 an
 extent?
 And
 that's
 what
 I
 mean
 for


those
 that
 didn't
 see
 this
 viral
 thing


over
 the
 weekend.
 I
 showed
 this
 on
 the


market
 close
 but
 this
 is
 what
 really
 I


think
 is
 starting
 to
 get
 people
 a
 bit


more
 worried.
 Um,
 Nano
 Banana
 Pro


is
 showing
 their
 image
 generation.
 And


if
 I
 showed
 you
 this
 picture
 and
 said
 it


was
 AI,
 it's
 not
 that
 easy
 to
 believe.


Now,
 if
 I
 showed
 you
 this
 picture,
 very


easy
 to
 believe
 that's
 AI.
 If
 I
 showed


you
 this
 picture,
 pretty
 easy
 to
 believe


it's
 AI.
 This
 last
 one
 is
 really
 getting


people
 to
 think,
 what
 is
 an
 influencer


going
 to
 look
 like
 in
 the
 future?


Like
 if
 some
 Instagram


girl
 influencer
 slides
 into
 your
 DMs,
 is


is
 that
 really
 a
 human
 or
 is
 that
 just


someone
 who's
 trying
 to
 sell
 you
 a


service
 and
 is
 they're
 so
 realistic
 that


you
 end
 up
 talking
 to
 the
 girl
 because


you
 think
 she's
 I
 mean
 that's
 already


happening
 to
 an
 extent
 in
 so
 many
 ways.


But
 when
 it's
 actually
 realistic,


you
 know,
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 for


someone
 like
 me
 that
 that
 that
 creates


content?
 like
 if
 if
 there's
 an
 AI


version
 of
 the
 news
 every
 day
 that's


almost
 as
 realistic
 and
 it's
 like
 you


know
 it's
 like
 maybe
 it
 pronounces
 words


correctly
 and
 so
 people
 like
 listening


to
 it
 like
 you
 there's
 just
 a
 lot
 of


questions
 around
 the
 creativity
 element


of
 AI
 that
 people
 are
 are
 so
 excited


about
 like
 oh
 AI
 is
 going to
 you
 know


make
 people
 more
 creative
 it's
 like
 well


it's
 also
 going
 to
 use
 that
 creativity


and
 commoditize
 the
 concept
 of
 being


creative
 in
 the
 first
 place
 to
 an
 extent


not
 fully
 but


I
 think
 that's
 something
 that
 could
 take


place
 as
 well


it
 could
 be
 the
 end
 of
 influencers.
 I


well
 I
 I
 think
 it
 there
 will
 always
 be
 a


career
 for
 influencers,
 but
 it
 might
 be


the
 uh
 it
 might
 start
 to
 um
 like


depreciate
 the
 value
 of
 a
 human


influencer
 that
 has
 tons
 of
 different


flaws,


right?
 Like
 if
 if
 you're
 an
 average
 if


you're
 a
 company
 and
 and
 you're
 you're


you're
 getting
 an
 influencer
 to
 do
 an


advertising
 deal
 with
 you
 and
 you
 want


the
 influencer
 to
 do
 X,
 Y,
 and
 Z
 in


their
 Instagram
 ad
 or
 whatever,
 like


what
 if
 they
 don't
 have
 a
 good
 ad?
 What


if
 you
 can
 tell
 this
 AI
 influencer
 who


already
 has
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of


followers
 because
 everyone
 thinks


they're
 real?
 Or
 maybe
 they
 know
 they're


fake,
 but
 they
 they
 don't
 care.
 They


still
 want
 to
 follow
 them.
 And
 they


could
 do
 the
 ad
 perfectly
 because
 you


can
 literally
 prompt
 the
 influencer
 on


how
 to
 make
 the
 perfect
 ad.


I
 mean,
 that
 that
 that's
 a
 real
 thing


that
 could
 uh
 you
 know,
 that
 could
 take


place.


Oh,
 no.
 No
 more
 influencers
 anyway.


Yeah.
 It
 it's
 just
 an
 argument
 around


how
 um
 the
 creative
 element
 of
 AI
 is
 in


question
 in
 a
 in
 a
 variety
 of
 different


ways.
 In
 fact,
 there
 was
 this
 girl
 on


Twitter.
 So,
 um
 she
 works
 at
 a
 company


called
 Sumo.
 Sumo
 just
 raised
 $200


million,
 I
 believe,
 for
 uh
 yeah,
 $2.45


billion.
 Some
 of
 you
 in
 the
 music
 world


might
 know
 about
 this.
 Uh
 they're
 an
 AI


music
 platform.
 They
 help
 you
 make
 AI


music.
 They
 raised
 250
 million.
 So,
 the


girl
 who's
 like
 the
 head
 of
 creators,


she
 she
 put
 out
 this
 Saab
 story
 of
 how


when
 she
 was
 younger,
 her
 parents


couldn't
 afford
 her
 music
 lessons,
 uh,


but
 she
 wanted
 to
 desperately
 be
 a


musician.
 And
 then
 she's
 like,
 I'm


beyond
 proud
 to
 work
 for
 a
 company
 that


is
 enabling
 music
 creation.
 And
 don't


look
 at
 the
 comments.
 Don't
 look
 at
 the


comments.
 I
 did
 not
 think
 this
 would
 be


the
 response.
 21
 million
 views.
 I'll
 put


it
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you
 want
 to
 read
 the


comments.


almost
 99%
 of
 the
 comments,
 and
 I
 could


not
 believe
 this
 because
 when
 I
 read
 the


post,
 I
 didn't
 think
 it
 would
 be
 a
 post


that
 like
 almost
 21
 million
 people
 hate


on,
 but
 basically
 they
 were
 like,
 "We


don't
 want
 your
 SOP
 story
 about
 being


poor
 in
 2006
 and
 your
 parents
 couldn't


afford
 music
 lessons.
 AI
 music
 is
 the


worst
 thing
 that
 humanity
 has
 come
 up


with,
 and
 you're
 ruining
 the
 art
 and


creativity
 of
 music."


And
 I
 could
 not
 believe
 that
 was


response.
 Now
 I
 understand
 like
 I'm
 not


a
 musician.
 I
 understand
 if
 you're
 a


musician,
 you
 feel
 so
 deeply
 about
 this


and
 you
 think
 that,
 you
 know,
 music


should
 come
 from
 the
 soul.
 Music
 should


come
 from
 your
 hard
 work
 on
 learning
 how


to
 play
 the
 piano
 and
 the
 guitar.
 By
 the


way,
 I
 saw
 Hell's
 Kitchen
 over
 the


weekend
 with
 my
 sister
 and
 cousin
 in


Broadway.
 Phenomenal
 show.
 Hell's


Kitchen.
 Let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 chat
 if


anyone
 watched
 it.
 I
 mean,
 the
 respect
 I


have
 for
 people
 on
 Broadway
 that
 perform


twice
 a
 day
 that
 can
 sing
 and
 dance
 at


the
 same
 time.
 My
 goodness,
 dude.
 It's


Alicia
 Keys
 uh
 Broadway
 show.
 Just
 one


of
 the
 best
 Broadway
 shows
 I've
 ever


seen.
 But
 those
 artists
 that
 were
 on


stage,
 I
 I
 would
 bet
 they're
 not
 going


to
 they're
 not
 happy
 about
 this
 AI
 art


artistic
 movement
 that's
 happening


because
 they
 put
 in
 real
 work
 and
 they


want
 to
 be
 compensated
 for
 their
 work
 as


an
 artist.
 And
 if
 everyone
 can
 just
 make


an
 AI
 song
 because
 everyone
 can
 prompt


this
 app
 that's
 now
 worth
 freaking$2


billion
 dollars
 of,
 hey,
 I
 want
 to
 sound


like
 Justin
 Bieber
 combined
 with
 Usher


and
 I
 want
 there
 to
 be
 like
 a
 jazz


background
 to
 the
 beat
 and
 you
 can
 just


like
 use
 natural
 language
 to
 create


music.
 Like
 where's
 the
 creativity
 in


it?
 Now
 some
 people
 would
 say
 that's


actually
 very
 creative
 based
 on
 the


nature
 of
 how
 you're
 prompting
 it.
 Other


people
 would
 say
 it
 is
 ruthlessly


ruining


the
 nature
 of
 how
 people
 relate
 to


music.


And
 so
 again,
 I
 mean,
 read
 the
 comments


under
 I
 did
 not
 expect
 her
 to
 get


roasted
 as
 bad
 as
 she
 did,
 but
 it
 was


horrible.
 Look
 at
 that.
 This
 is
 her
 in


2006.
 She
 couldn't
 afford
 any
 music


lessons.
 You
 thought
 it
 was a
 cute


story.
 Everyone
 in
 the
 comments
 was


like,
 "We
 don't
 care.
 You
 are
 ruining


humanity
 with
 your
 AI
 music
 [ __ ]


And
 I
 I
 think
 the
 reason
 for
 that
 also


is
 because
 people
 take
 music
 very


seriously.
 People
 take
 music
 very


seriously.
 Like
 look,
 I
 love
 music,
 but


I'm
 not
 like
 I
 don't
 care
 that
 much


about
 there's
 people
 that
 are
 like,
 you


know,
 they
 will
 die
 for
 their
 playlist.


And
 so
 when
 you
 start
 to
 threaten
 that


and
 say
 that,
 you
 know,
 these
 artists


don't
 necessarily
 need
 to,
 we
 don't
 need


Taylor
 Swift.
 We
 can
 prompt
 some
 girl


that
 sounds
 like
 Taylor
 Swift.
 You
 know,


people
 get
 really
 passionate
 about
 that.


And
 I
 think
 that
 could
 be
 the
 issue


that's
 taking
 place.


Chad
 says,
 "I
 would
 say
 the
 same
 thing


for
 social
 media
 and
 attention."
 Well,
 I


agree.
 The
 entire
 attention
 economy
 is


built
 on
 this
 idea
 that
 you
 put
 out


content
 that
 is
 unique
 and
 original,
 at


least
 if
 you
 want
 to
 develop
 an


audience.
 I
 mean,
 how
 did
 I
 build
 my


brand?
 No
 one
 was
 really
 talking
 about


Palunteer
 in
 2021.
 I
 started
 talking


about
 it.
 People
 found
 it
 interesting.


And
 then,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 story
 takes


off
 from
 there.


That's
 how
 most
 creators
 build
 an


audience.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 you


have
 to
 say
 something
 or
 do
 something


that's
 interesting.
 People
 find
 it
 uh


consumable
 and
 then
 you
 have
 to
 use
 that


to
 continue
 building
 momentum.
 If
 that


entire
 industry
 starts
 to
 fall
 apart
 or


the
 entire
 concept
 of
 the
 industry


starts
 to
 uh
 weaken
 because
 there
 is
 no


real
 creativity


because
 everything's
 a
 guy.
 I
 mean,


we're
 already
 seeing
 this
 on
 Twitter.


the
 amount
 of
 financial
 accounts
 that


are
 just
 prompting
 chat
 GBT
 to
 like


explain
 complex
 financial
 topics
 and


then
 just
 copy
 and
 pasting
 it
 on
 X.
 Like


you
 can
 easily
 tell
 when
 it's
 just
 AI


slop.


The
 amount
 of
 accounts
 I
 saw
 yesterday


tweeting
 about
 Japanese
 bond
 yields.
 I


was
 like,
 okay.
 Like
 I'm
 not
 tweeting


about
 it
 because
 I'm
 trying
 to
 study
 it


so
 that
 I
 could
 like
 actually
 write


something
 that
 doesn't
 sound
 like
 Chad


just
 generated
 it.
 Everyone
 else
 like
 oh


the
 bond
 yield
 is
 rising.
 Here's
 all
 the


reasons
 it's
 bad
 or
 good.
 It's
 like
 just


a
 bunch
 of
 copied
 pasted
 nonsense
 from


GBT.


So
 I
 think
 we're
 already
 seeing
 a
 commod


commodification
 of
 attention
 to
 some


extent.


Shout
 out
 to
 Mr.
 Derek
 Wall.
 Look
 at
 him


being
 Santa
 Claus
 to
 start
 off
 December


with
 the
 50
 gifted.


Rob,
 you
 got
 a
 membership.
 George,
 you


got
 a
 membership.
 Uh
 Lean,
 you
 got
 a


membership.
 Tom
 Baker,
 you
 got
 a


membership.
 SV,
 you
 got
 a
 membership.


Thomas,
 you
 got
 a
 membership.


Thank
 you,
 Mr.
 Derek,
 for
 the
 50


memberships.
 Again,
 I
 did
 have
 a
 great


dinner
 with
 Derek
 and
 TripleV.


It
 was
 fun.


It
 was
 fun.
 I
 showed
 them,
 dude.
 I


showed
 them
 the
 steak
 we
 ate.
 Dererick's


used
 to
 this
 type
 of
 steak,
 but
 I'm
 not.


And
 uh
 yeah,
 your
 boy
 legit
 legit
 ate


it.
 So,


there
 you
 go.


But
 no,
 it
 was
 fun.
 It
 was
 great


connecting
 with
 Derek.
 Great


connectoring
 with
 Triple
 V.
 And
 uh


it
 was
 a
 good
 time.
 It
 was a
 really
 good


time.
 It
 was
 also
 a
 good
 steak.
 Like
 I


really
 have
 never
 ate
 steak
 like
 that.


So
 I
 was
 happy
 I
 just
 went
 through
 and


ate
 it.


It
 was
 time
 to
 freaking
 eat
 it.
 Is
 BMR


still
 down?
 BMR
 is
 still
 down.
 By
 the


way,
 speaking
 of
 crypto
 cycles,
 when


Derrick
 was
 on
 the
 show
 back
 in
 August,


I
 mean,


did
 he
 not
 say,
 "Hey,
 it's
 Gerrick's


been
 OG
 Bitcoin
 literally
 since
 2010.


So,
 he
 understands
 these
 crypto
 cycles.


Now,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 he
 fully
 believes


in
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 cycles,
 but
 he


definitely
 did
 say
 the
 cycle
 top
 is


coming
 up.
 And
 that
 was
 in
 August.
 Quite


literally,
 two
 months
 later,
 we
 had
 our


at least
 short-term
 top.
 And
 now
 the


question
 is
 if
 that
 is
 the
 actual
 top


for
 the
 next
 360
 days.


The
 other
 stat
 I've
 heard
 and
 this
 is


Derrick
 said
 this
 as
 well
 is
 you
 buy
 500


days
 before
 the
 having
 you
 you
 sell
 500


days
 after
 the
 having
 and
 I
 believe
 we


are


500
 days
 after
 the
 having
 at
 this
 point.


I
 think
 we
 got
 there
 around
 that


September
 October
 time
 frame.
 So
 you


know
 that
 could
 be
 another
 cyclical


coincidence
 that
 that
 people
 have
 to


analyze.
 Open
 door
 right
 there
 is
 down


6%.
 GameStop's
 up
 1.3
 AMD
 is
 up
 a
 little


bit
 and
 then
 Robin
 Hood
 still
 down
 5%.


Bro,
 you're
 Indian.
 You
 can't
 have
 any


beef.
 You
 know,
 as
 long
 as
 you
 guys


don't
 tell
 my
 grandma
 that
 I
 ate
 that


steak,
 I'll
 be
 okay.


Now,
 if
 you
 show
 her
 that
 picture
 and


said
 your
 grandson
 ate
 it,
 she's


probably
 going
 to
 have
 a
 word
 with
 me.


But


as
 long
 as
 she
 doesn't
 know,
 we
 should


be
 okay.


Uh
 Nick
 said,
 "We
 saw
 Hell's
 Kitchen.
 If


you
 love
 musicals,
 go
 see
 MJ.
 You'll


love
 it
 as
 well."
 Yeah,
 I
 want
 to
 see


the
 Michael
 Jackson
 one.
 I haven't
 seen


that
 one
 yet,


but
 I
 have
 just
 so
 much
 respect
 for
 the


people
 on
 Broadway,
 dude.
 Like


unbelievable


the
 amount
 of
 work.
 They
 do
 it
 twice
 a


day
 and
 they're
 singing
 and
 dancing
 and


like
 the
 singing
 is
 like
 really
 good


singing,
 too.
 It's
 just
 I
 thought
 it
 was


incredible.
 Last
 Broadway
 show
 I
 watched


was
 Lion
 King
 a
 year
 ago
 in
 uh
 a
 couple


years
 before
 that.
 So,
 I
 haven't
 seen
 it


in
 a
 while,


but
 I
 think
 it
 was
 good
 to


kind
 of
 catch
 up
 on
 on
 the
 fun
 of


Broadway.
 Uh,
 we
 have
 an
 update
 on


tariffs
 right
 here.
 Let
 me
 pull
 this
 up


real
 quick.
 This
 is
 with
 uh
 the
 UK.


Let's
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here.


>> Trade
 deal
 on
 drug
 pricing.
 Now,
 there


are
 two
 parts
 to
 this
 deal
 as
 laid
 out


uh
 in
 statements
 by
 the
 US
 and
 UK


governments
 just
 over
 the
 past
 20


minutes
 or
 so.
 The
 first
 part
 is
 that


the
 National
 Health
 Service
 in
 the
 UK


will
 pay
 more
 for
 pharmaceuticals.


That's
 been
 a
 bone
 of
 contention
 on
 the


US
 side
 uh
 for
 years
 uh
 that
 the
 UK
 uh


government
 is
 not
 paying
 high
 enough


prices
 for
 American
 pharmaceuticals.


That
 according
 to
 the
 both
 governments


is
 going
 to
 change
 and
 they'll
 do
 that


in
 exchange
 for
 an
 agreement
 that
 import


taxes
 on
 pharmaceuticals
 from
 the
 UK
 to


the
 US
 uh
 be
 set
 at
 zero
 for
 the
 next


three
 years.
 So
 that's
 the
 overall


structure
 of
 the
 deal.
 But
 we're
 also


seeing
 a
 statement
 here
 uh
 from
 Bristol


Meyers
 CEO
 saying
 that
 he
 anticipates


being
 able
 to
 invest
 upwards
 of
 $500


million
 over
 the
 next
 5
 years
 as
 a


result
 of
 the
 deal
 in
 the
 UK
 version
 of


this
 release.
 He
 says
 that
 this


agreement
 is
 a
 sign
 of
 progress
 and
 one


that
 creates
 an
 environment
 conducive
 to


our
 continued
 presence
 in
 the
 UK.
 So


obviously
 a
 big
 corporate
 piece
 to
 this


announcement
 as
 well,
 guys.
 Back
 over
 to


you.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 a
 big
 deal,
 Aean,
 and


also
 a
 big
 deal
 for
 Europe,
 which


doesn't
 have
 this
 kind
 of
 sweetheart


deal,
 and
 they
 ship
 a
 lot
 of
 drugs
 from


places
 like
 Ireland
 as
 well.
 They
 have


the
 higher
 tariffs.


>> Yeah.
 And
 you
 wonder
 if
 this
 puts


pressure
 on
 other
 European
 countries
 to


now
 come
 to
 the
 table
 and
 get
 a
 similar


deal
 or
 maybe
 now
 at
 this
 point,
 not


quite
 as
 good
 of
 a
 deal
 as
 the
 UK
 is


getting
 here.


>> All
 right,
 Aean,
 thank
 you.


All
 right,
 seems
 like
 that's
 the


big
 tariff
 news
 of
 the
 morning.
 UK


pharma
 imports
 will
 continue
 to
 be
 at


zero


as
 the
 tariff
 debacle
 around


pharmaceuticals
 continues
 to
 I
 guess
 be


in
 question.
 We
 we
 you
 know
 we
 got
 some


updates
 last
 week
 with
 Lily
 and
 Novo,


but
 you
 know
 Trump
 has
 said
 he
 wants
 to


tariff
 pharmaceuticals
 so
 that
 we
 start


manufacturing
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 It's


just
 it's
 tough
 to
 do
 that,
 you
 know,


when
 people
 really
 need
 their
 drugs.
 So,


I
 think
 keeping
 them
 at
 zero
 for
 the
 UK


does
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.
 Invid
 right


there,
 178.88.
 That's
 up
 1.0%.
 Amcore


having
 a
 better
 day,
 up
 2%
 than
 the
 S&P


not
 that
 far
 off
 from
 reclaiming


the
 high
 that
 we
 had
 on
 Wednesday.


All
 right,
 folks.
 I
 think
 that's
 it
 for


me
 today.
 We'll
 be
 back
 on
 the
 close.


We'll
 see
 what
 we've
 got
 going
 on.
 We


don't
 have
 any
 other
 earnings,
 honestly,


this
 week.
 We
 don't
 have
 too
 much.
 Um,


yeah,
 no
 earnings
 today.
 Honestly,
 no


earnings
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 week.


Actually,
 we
 had,
 well,
 we
 do
 have,
 no,


we
 do
 have
 earnings
 tomorrow.
 We
 have


Marll,
 Crowdstrite,
 and
 Octa
 tomorrow.


Um,
 and
 we
 have
 Oh,
 we
 have
 MongoDB
 this


morning.
 How
 did
 they
 do?
 I
 didn't
 even


look
 at
 [ __ ]
 And
 then
 we'll
 do
 word
 of


the
 day.
 [ __ ]


that's
 flat.
 Oh,
 Micron
 is
 Micron.
 No,


no
 Micron
 was
 a
 while
 ago.


Oh,
 we
 have
 Salesforce
 and
 Snowflake
 on


Wednesday.
 We
 still
 have
 some
 earnings.


We
 have
 Macy's
 as
 well.
 All right,
 so
 we


have
 some
 earnings
 this
 week,
 but


nothing
 today
 after
 the
 bell.
 We
 did
 a


MongoDB.


Um,
 oh,
 sorry.
 MongoDB
 is
 after
 the


bell.
 Sorry.
 Sorry.
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 in


the
 morning.
 It's
 after
 the
 bell.
 Okay,


so
 MongoDB
 and
 Krato,
 MDB
 and
 CRDO
 after


the
 B.
 All right,
 so
 we'll
 take
 a
 look


at
 those
 earnings
 later
 today
 as
 well.


Did
 your
 sister
 turn
 into
 a
 socialist?


No,
 but
 uh
 they
 did
 have
 a
 conversation


about
 taxes
 and
 uh
 look,
 my
 sister
 held


her
 ground.
 She
 she
 she
 she
 did
 not
 uh


deflect
 from
 her
 stance,
 but
 Triple
 V


was
 not
 able
 to
 uh
 to
 convince
 her.
 So,


no,
 she
 she
 was
 just
 like,
 I
 think


billionaires
 should
 should
 contribute


more
 to
 society.
 And
 then
 they
 got
 into


a
 conversation
 about,
 well,
 who
 creates


the
 jobs
 for
 society,
 yada
 yada.
 So,
 it


kind
 of
 went
 back
 and
 forth
 as
 a
 typical


debate
 does.


Um,
 but
 she
 held
 her
 ground


and
 made
 her
 case.
 But
 it
 was
 good.
 It


was
 it
 was
 overall
 it
 was
 a
 fun
 time.


Steve
 was
 there.
 Um,
 we
 had
 some
 other


family
 members
 on
 on
 Vlad's
 side.
 It
 was


just
 like
 it
 was
 all
 it
 was
 a
 great


time.
 It
 was
 almost
 like
 15
 of
 us
 and
 it


was
 just
 really
 cool
 to
 connect
 and
 meet


with
 everyone
 once
 again.
 All
 right,


word
 of
 the
 day.
 So,
 we've
 prompted
 GPT


Derrick
 as
 we
 beat
 her
 down.
 Look,
 but


she
 held
 her
 own.
 She
 did
 it.
 She
 didn't


like
 I
 kind
 of
 thought
 she
 would
 be


like,
 "Oh,
 yeah,
 you're
 right."
 She
 was


like, "Nope."
 She
 like
 she's
 like
 the


name
 is
 Matti.
 You
 know,
 so
 she
 was
 like


she
 was
 holding
 on
 to
 her
 beliefs
 right


here.
 Word
 of
 the
 day,
 convexity.
 So,
 we


prompted
 GPT
 to
 give
 us
 uh
 finance
 words


of
 the
 day
 so
 we
 can
 learn
 a
 little
 bit


more
 on
 utilizing
 some
 of these
 words.


Convexity,
 I've
 definitely
 heard
 this


word
 before.
 A
 measure
 of
 how
 the
 price


of
 a
 bond
 changes
 as
 interest
 rates


change,
 capturing
 the
 curvature


of
 that
 relationship.


Most
 people
 know
 duration
 basic,
 but


convexity
 is
 the
 next
 level.
 It
 explains


why
 some
 bonds
 accelerate
 in
 price
 when


rates
 move
 and
 why
 others
 lag.
 It's
 a


big
 deal
 for
 mortgage
 back
 securities,


hedging,
 and
 options
 on
 bonds.


I
 think
 Jason
 has
 used
 this
 word
 a
 lot


as
 well
 uh
 not
 only
 to
 to
 refer
 to
 bond


prices
 but
 also
 to
 just
 general
 price


divergence
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 technical


analysis.


So
 that's
 definitely
 a
 word
 that
 we
 have


heard
 many
 times
 before.
 Convexity
 a


measure
 of
 how
 the
 price
 of
 a
 bond


changes
 as
 interest
 rates
 change


capturing
 the
 curvature
 of
 that


relationship.
 Again
 the
 Japanese
 bond


yields
 the
 high
 since
 2008.
 I
 think


that's
 what
 sold
 Bitcoin
 off
 last
 night


early
 into
 this
 morning.
 And
 then
 the


10-year
 still
 above
 four.
 It
 was
 below


four
 on
 Wednesday,


now
 spiking
 up
 a
 little
 bit


as
 well.


All
 right,
 cool.
 That
 is
 it
 for
 me.


Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.


Derek,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 50
 gifted


again.
 Appreciate
 you
 being
 here.
 Um,


we'll
 be
 back
 on
 the
 close.
 We
 got
 some


earnings.


Then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there
 and


we'll
 see
 how
 we
 start
 off
 the
 month
 of


December.
 Maybe
 S&P
 reclaims
 some
 of


that
 green.
 We
 are
 awfully
 close
 and
 we


can
 end
 up
 having
 a
 green
 day
 for
 the


first
 day
 of
 December
 on
 the
 S&P.


Bitcoin
 moving
 a
 little
 bit
 right
 here


from
 83.5
 to
 85.


So
 you
 got
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 red
 candle


with
 Bitcoin
 at
 85,100.


All
 right.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 We'll
 see
 you
 all
 on
 the


market
 close.
 Bye
 everybody.
 Have
 a
 good


one.
