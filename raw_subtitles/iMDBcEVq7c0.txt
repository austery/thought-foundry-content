So I basically started to bring up a bunch of call transcripts. And what I started to see is they all kind of start the same way and they just end it with this call ID. So the only thing different from call to call was this call ID. So basically I needed to figure out, well, can I create a. feed for Zapier so knew the call ID of each new call as it occurred. So the first step is essentially a trigger where a new call comes in and then what happens is when the new call comes in what it will do is it'll basically scrape the information from Gong and one of the things Gong will give you is that call ID. So I'm able to actually see the call ID. So if I click here and I scroll over, you'll actually see that there's a call ID that I can identify here, which is right here. So that appended to the URL essentially is all I needed to give browse to be able to go to that URL and essentially scrape the call transcript. So it wasn't connected. I had to kind of hack it together. It basically knows what to run just based upon what's brought in and then it will go to this page and it's able to essentially scrape the entire transcript. So this is the raw transcript that's coming from the GAN calls by Browse AI going to that GAN page and then getting this information.
