Hi everyone, I'm Anthony.
Welcome to my channel
Today we'll talk about...
An interesting phenomenon in the Chinese internet
That's the culture of gossiping.
In recent years we have discovered
More and more people are getting used to using PDF or PPT files.
To express the harm suffered
And the exposure and criticism of the oppressors
and spread it on the Internet.
These PDF files often have dozens or even hundreds of pages.
Moreover, there is a trend towards academicization and standardization.
Traditional verbal battles and denunciations
It is often a fragmented emotional outburst.
But now
PDF essays popular on the Chinese internet
It looks quite rigorous.
Table of contents, abstract, timeline, cited references, etc.
All available
These documents
Usually with a heart-pounding title
For example, "About Unveiling the True Face of So-and-So"
Real-name report
Detailed Explanation of an Infidelity Case at a Certain University
Avoidance Tips: Exposing the Top Scumbag at a British University
Or perhaps it would be "My Story with a Gold Digger from a Certain College"
These documents are not just text.
They are more like an online indictment.
It has a table of contents and a timeline.
There are screenshots of chat logs accurate to the second.
There are transfer vouchers
There is also photographic and video evidence.
In order to construct a chain of evidence
Numerous private conversations and bedroom photos
Even information about the other party and their family.
They were all disclosed indiscriminately.
When these PDF essays
When it was widely circulated on the Internet
Those accused are often presumed guilty.
In the dense array of pictures, text, and tables
People will be immersed in a trial atmosphere.
This evidence constructs a closed narrative space.
It makes it easy for people to immerse themselves in the created image.
The perspective of the perfect victim
Feeling the pain of betrayal
and the feeling of righteous indignation
However, although there are countless types of melons to eat...
However, the ways in which people participate are becoming increasingly homogenized.
No matter how bizarre or exaggerated these stories are
Their core is extremely monotonous.
In this narrative
There are only two main characters.
Absolutely innocent victims
and the absolute evil oppressor
So
How should we view this trend and culture?
Why is a person
Displaying one's wounds in public
It can evolve into a way to mobilize the masses.
and public opinion
I recently read a really great book.
The title is quite long
the rise of victimhood culture
Microaggressions
safe spaces and the new culture Wars
The translation is "The Rise of Victim Culture".
Micro-intrusion, safe space and new cultural warfare
Although this book studies American university campuses
But he also explained and summarized it precisely.
Various phenomena on the Chinese Internet
So let's start by talking about this book today.
Exploring the common victim culture in Chinese society
I will upload this video.
Included in the list of "Psychology and Education"
If you have anything you'd like to discuss with me
And the topics of consultation
You can contact me via email to make an appointment.
First, what is victim culture?
According to the authors of this book, Campbell and Manning
Moral forms of human society
It is undergoing an evolution
We are moving away from a culture of honor that emphasizes personal revenge.
and a culture of dignity that emphasizes legal constraints.
Transitioning to a completely new form: victim culture
In victim culture
Individuals are highly sensitive to offenses from others
But they are no longer like the culture of honor.
Seeking a private resolution
It's not like a culture of dignity that disdains this.
Instead, they tend to turn to third parties
Appeals are usually filed by administrative agencies or public opinion.
More importantly
In this culture
victim
No longer just a weakling in need of sympathy
Instead, it gained a lofty moral status.
It can even be said
Suffering and marginalization
It has become a new kind of moral capital
Based on this understanding
I think
We can consider the victim culture of the Chinese internet.
Divided into five major categories
These five areas are progressively layered.
This forms a tightly woven network of victim narratives.
First, the realm of personal emotions
Mainly focused on romantic relationships
Here, the logic of victim culture is...
The breakdown of the emotional contract
For example, infidelity, deception, or financial disputes.
Transformed into crimes at the moral or even quasi-legal level.
The parties involved revealed private details
Trying to prove that they are absolutely innocent
thereby
To acquire the power to impose social punishment on the other party.
What we said
PDF essays exposing scumbag men and women
Most belong to this field
The second area is identity politics in non-personal relationships.
This refers to the absence of a direct power relationship.
But the conflict between strangers of different identities
For example, men and women
Rich and poor, locals and outsiders
Here, the conflict is often no longer about specific people.
It's about identity.
Victim culture brings friction between individuals
Rising to a privileged group
Systemic oppression of marginalized groups
The third field
Occurring in a relationship of unequal power
This is common between teachers and students, and between superiors and subordinates.
Due to the existence of an objective power gap
The weaker party
They often no longer trust the internal problem-solving mechanisms of the organization.
Instead, they chose to weaponize the victim experience.
Using online appeals to force concessions from those in power.
The fourth field
It is a minor offense to symbols and culture.
This is not a direct conflict between people.
It is a war of ideas.
It manifests itself in the inappropriate remarks of a certain celebrity.
Aesthetic controversy surrounding a movie poster
Or a joke by a stand-up comedian.
Here
The logic of victim culture is language and violence.
As the book says
Micro-infringement is no longer about intent.
Rather, it's a subjective feeling.
Finally, and most thought-provoking, is the area...
Internal cleaning
That is, the involution of victim culture.
The author refers to it as the "spiral of purity" in the book.
purity spirals
This is a
Witch hunts occurring within the same faction
for example
We see a certain feminist blogger being criticized for not being radical enough.
Criticized by fans for not being feminist enough
A certain patriotic influencer has always liked to incite radical sentiments.
On one occasion, he made a few rational and pertinent remarks.
He was then criticized by fans for having a "biased" attitude.
This reveals a special organizational logic.
In this system
Although everyone is a victim
But after defeating the oppressor
They've started cleaning up those victims who weren't pure enough again.
This topic
We will also make a video specifically discussing this in the future.
Actually, from this book
We can find
Victim Culture in China and the United States
There are still considerable differences.
First of all
The third parties that China and the United States rely on are different.
In the author's view
American victim culture
It is a system that heavily relies on administrative authority.
American universities
When students feel offended
They tend to go to the university administration.
For example, Title IX office
Or a bias response team seeks intervention
They demanded that authoritative bodies use institutional power.
To provide protection and arbitration
In the context of the Chinese internet
Especially in the area of ​​marital disputes we just mentioned
Such institutions are often absent.
Facing infidelity or emotional deception
The law is usually difficult to intervene in.
There is no emotional arbitration committee.
Come and uphold justice
Therefore, Chinese netizens often choose to skip the institutions.
Appealing directly to public opinion
This appeal method
No longer seeking institutionalized relief
It's more like a decentralized approach.
Debate sessions that do not require due process
Secondly, the focus of the issues is different.
Western victim culture
It mainly revolves around group identity.
Such as race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.
Its core logic is resistance against privilege and oppression.
The focus is on structural inequality.
In Chinese internet PDF essays
We are seeing more focus on personal relationships.
For example, infidelity, deception in a relationship, and financial disputes.
This seems like just gossip about everyday family matters.
Unlike Western identity politics
But they also share some commonalities.
That is, they all construct victim identities.
To acquire moral capital
Our video today mainly discusses the first type.
This refers to the victim culture in romantic relationships.
Let's first look at this case.
A male working in Shanghai
I started dating a girl who was studying at a university in Xi'an.
During a long-distance relationship
This girl cheated on her boyfriend with her ex-boyfriend.
So the boy created a 63-page PDF.
It's full of things the male protagonist found on his girlfriend's phone.
Found chat history
The entire conversation between the female protagonist and her lover was recorded.
This proves that the female protagonist did indeed cheat on her husband.
At the end of the PDF
He described himself as "charging forward for love."
He said he wasn't doing it to get revenge on anyone.
I just hope this girl's good friend
Her family and teachers can advise her.
Discipline her
I hope there are honest people like myself in the world.
Don't let yourself be bullied.
This PDF file later became widely circulated.
Someone probably reminded him
Making private chat logs and photos public
May involve criminal activity
Therefore, the male protagonist urgently issued a statement.
To express one's true intention
I do not intend for this PDF to be distributed online.
I just wanted to send this to the girl's friends and family to vent my frustrations.
But at the beginning of this statement
He still emphasized
I am the biggest victim of infidelity.
Here, the boy set a premise.
Infidelity is a crime that harms the public interest.
Absolutely evil behavior
Precisely because it is evil
So even if you expose the other person's privacy
It is also just to drag them to the square for public denunciation.
As a pure love warrior and an honest person
Possessing a natural moral immunity
This leads to a huge confusion.
Can infidelity be equated with theft or robbery?
Theft and robbery
It infringes on public order and the rights granted by law.
But in a romantic relationship
Cheating, changing one's mind, or falling out of love.
Although painful
This may have violated their promise.
But this essentially falls into the category of personal grudges.
It is often a complex gray color.
Rather than black and white
Victim stories
nature
It should not be decided by public opinion.
In private relationships concluded on an equal and voluntary basis
As long as neither party violates the law in a generally sense.
Or basic morality
For example, domestic violence
Financial fraud, personal attacks, restriction of freedom, etc.
So
Its essence
They are two free souls.
Let's start a business together
It is not a contract of servitude.
It is not a certificate of ownership.
The two parties established an intimate relationship
Based on current love and desire
It is a continuous and dynamic consent.
However, due to external or internal reasons
There are no laws or gods
Can this wish be guaranteed to remain unchanged forever?
If someone changes their mind
Therefore, he himself does not violate any morality.
because
Human emotions cannot be completely controlled by willpower.
One cannot force oneself not to be sad.
You can't force yourself to love or not love someone.
It is a fact.
certainly
This could perhaps be considered a breach of contract.
But breach of contract is not necessarily a crime.
In business logic
If one party breaches the contract
The other party may demand payment of liquidated damages.
However, breach of contract is not necessarily the same as fraud.
We can certainly assume
This kind of extramarital desire is dangerous.
It could potentially bring some consequences to the cheater.
But we should first understand this state.
Then negotiate with the other party.
Instead of directly from a moral standpoint
To condemn the other person's infidelity
The foundation of love lies in freedom.
If the other person doesn't love me freely
Then that's not love.
For example, the love a slave has for his slave owner.
However
A person can love me freely.
Of course, it also means that he is free to not love me.
Since that's the case
So the act of changing one's mind itself
This does not constitute an infringement or harm.
If we define infidelity as fraud
We are actually saying
The moment you enter a relationship
Then you will forever lose the ability to love someone else.
Or the right to change one's mind
But this is not in line with human nature.
People are in motion.
Human emotions are complex.
Relationship cracks or even one party's infidelity
Often related to the symptoms of illness
Rather than one-sided evil
It suggests that we need to observe the root cause of the contradiction.
To communicate and solve problems
Or end it in a dignified way.
Romantic love, and even ordinary friendship.
Essentially, they are all venture capital investments.
We take our time
Emotion and trust as the principal
Relationship breakdown
Sometimes
It certainly stems from the immaturity of the cheater.
It stems from his certain mental deficiencies and incompetence.
We can also say
This behavior is terrible.
Unwise, regrettable, weak
But this is not the same as evil.
If we fail because of investment
They demanded that the partners be paraded through the streets in public.
This precisely exposes
We cannot afford the price of freedom.
When a mature adult faces betrayal
Of course it will feel very painful.
But he will not lower himself to the level of
A victim who can only be bullied
I do not deny my responsibility in it.
He will realize that I have the responsibility to make choices.
Perhaps it was my fault that led to my partner's infidelity.
Or perhaps the other person is too immature.
Don't understand my goodness
However, this analysis depends on the specific circumstances.
I suffer for this.
Then choose to find a way to save it.
Or simply cut your losses and exit the market.
Instead of saying you are a demon
I will unite all honest people in the world to destroy you.
Do this
It actually has no meaning for one's own growth.
Because if it's your own problem
He should improve and reflect on himself.
If it's the other party's problem
Then he should be glad the other person left.
Focus on your future life
And this kind of meaningless revenge
This precisely proves that he lives for resentment.
According to Nietzsche
This kind of personal grudges
Escalating into a moral war
This is precisely a manifestation of slave morality.
Characteristics of slave morality
He simply cannot react through concrete actions.
Unable to be honest and straightforward with oneself
Hiding in the honest man
Or behind the mask of a group like victims
Praying for the collective strength of the flock to surround and kill others.
Perhaps this boy would think
This girl once told me
I will always love myself
She was so innocent and kind back then.
But things have changed now.
So I was scammed.
This logic seems rather pitiful.
But it's also a way of shirking responsibility.
Because when you're listening to his sweet words
And the moment you choose to believe.
You are not a passive receiver.
Rather, it is an actor exercising free will.
The video we discussed NPD on November 2nd
The distinction between external and internal responsibilities was mentioned.
External responsibility
That is, what we usually understand as
Ethical or legal responsibility
if
Someone was simply exercising their rights normally.
However, he was deceived and hurt by another person.
Therefore, the victims are of course 100% innocent.
There is no need to bear any responsibility.
Internal responsibility
This refers to responsibility at the spiritual level.
He was not at fault.
No one has the right to criticize him.
An existential responsibility
In this sense
People have responsibilities at every moment.
We don't need
Take responsibility for the objective harm you suffer.
But after we were hurt
How can we save ourselves?
But this is something I can take responsibility for.
Emotional commitment in intimate relationships
It's just a beautiful wish.
Rather than rights
Therefore, changing one's mind does not constitute an infringement.
On the level of ontology
No one
Having the right to keep another heart forever in perfect condition
This principle also applies if the genders are reversed.
A woman used this method of exposing her privacy
Accuse your boyfriend or husband of cheating
I believe this is also a form of vigilante justice.
Rather than resistance
Without physical violence
Under duress, manipulation, or restriction of freedom
An adult who is trapped in a painful relationship for a long time
She is often not simply a victim.
Rather, there was a degree of collusion.
For example, a woman's husband has a violent and cold temper.
This woman is unhappy.
Whether in terms of economy or capability
She has the freedom and confidence to leave.
However, she never left.
Instead, she criticizes and complains about her husband.
So
Although this woman was suffering in her marriage
But she likely also gained some additional benefits.
For example, she portrays a sacrificed wife.
You can avoid the tasks you should face in life.
She can stagnate her mind.
It's all because of that bad man.
she
They can also forever derive a sense of moral superiority from it.
certainly
This needs to be emphasized again.
Except for cases of domestic violence and restriction of personal freedom.
We certainly don't think so either.
All suffering is the victim's own fault.
They are sympathetic
It deserves to be understood.
However, if the surrounding people or social culture
Overly identifying with the victim
Role
In doing so, he reinforced the person's sense of incompetence.
thereby
It hindered the parties involved from overcoming and solving their own difficulties.
That's all for today's video.
