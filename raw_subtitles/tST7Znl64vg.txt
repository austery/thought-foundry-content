In 2023, after the hit of the Taiwanese drama "Wave Makers"
Several sexual harassment scandals broke out in Taiwan's political arena
Then spread to academia, art circles, and showbiz circles
Several sexual harassment scandals break out every day
Taiwan's #MeToo moment has finally arrived
Last week, it appeared on the international media Deutsche Welle
How should we view today's movement
How to understand the root cause of sexual harassment
Does this movement have the chance to bring about the most significant one-off peace reform in Taiwan in the past two decades?
First, let's start with the most common questioning of the #MeToo movement
Why didn't the victim report it immediately?
Why didn't you say it until now?
Do you want to follow the trend?
Psychologist Luis Fitzgerald studies victims of actual sexual harassment
found that compared to those who forbear in silence
Whoever comes forward has a worse life afterward.
Because sexual assault and harassment often occur without a third party
It is very difficult to prove
<font color=#FFF600FF>If you don't deal with it, then I can only appeal to the higher authorities</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>Do you have proof? Have it? </font>
Even if there is objective evidence that something really happened
Much circumstantial evidence is also needed
to prove that the victim did not participate voluntarily
Taiwanese psychoanalyst Peng Renyu also found that
Many victims will tell themselves with psychological cues
maybe it's not that serious
Maybe I did something wrong to cause these things
<font color=#FFF600FF>But after all, I did something wrong, didn't I? </font>
Victims' self-blame kept them from reporting in the first place
Evidence disappears over time and raises the threshold for proof in the future
So it's not a sudden increase in sexual harassment incidents in Taiwan
Rather, these events have always existed
But oppressed by the walls of law and self-condemnation
What's worse is
under the current legal system
If the victim cannot produce evidence
You may even be accused of defamation and false reporting
In the UK 2009-2014
100 women charged with reporting rape
50% of rape cases in the U.S. are closed by police with deliberate exceptions
Only 0.6% of rape cases in the US end up in jail
If even rape cases are hard to get judicial punishment
Sexual Harassment Cases Are More Difficult
2017 'House of Cards' actor Kevin Spacey accused of sexually assaulting underage males
As a result, a New York court dismissed the suits
Kevin Spacey wins lawsuit, says he will make comeback
back to hollywood
The same Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush was #MeToo
Defamation complaint against the Daily Telegraph that broke the news
The result was a court decision in Geoffrey Rush's favor in 2020
The Daily Telegraph still has to pay him $2 million.
These cases are almost telling the society
The law is on the side of the harasser
You can boldly harass people
Anyway, they can't produce evidence
you can sue them for defamation
they have to pay you back
<font color=#FFF600FF>Contact a lawyer and issue a statement</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>Stand firm, we will sue when necessary</font>
Precisely because many victims are all too aware
The legal system cannot give them justice
That's why I didn't take the legal route
Did not punish in the first place
<font color=#FFF600FF>If I appeal</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>I will keep repeating the whole process</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>In the end, because there was no witness and no physical evidence, it was left behind</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>Maybe someone will suspect what I want from him</font>
Those who questioned the fact that victims are only now following suit
actually reflects their ignorance of the system as a whole
Most victims don't gain more than they gain after reporting
Lost confidence in the legal system
Finally forced to leave the environment that hurt them
<font color=#FFF600FF>She is the most innocent and innocent person in the whole thing</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>But why</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>Why are we the last ones to leave? </font>
And some women don't even have the right to leave
According to the statistics
Taiwan in 2012-2018
More than 633 migrant workers were sexually assaulted and harassed
These migrant workers simply cannot easily leave the working environment
Employers even threaten them:
If you dare to complain, you will be sent back to your country
Those who were forced to leave and silenced before were all victims of sexual harassment
But after the MeToo movement emerged
Let victims know they are not alone
Individual trauma turns out to be collective trauma
when all the wounded individuals gather
can boost each other's strength
force the perpetrator to leave
change the overall social environment
don't let the hurt continue
<font color=#FFF600FF>How could Sister Wen Fang not know that this system has a lot of bad problems</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>So let's not just leave it alone</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>A lot of things can't just be left alone</font>
In the U.S
Hollywood's Harvey Weinstein and talk show actor Louis CK after being accused
condemned by a large number of public opinion
completely disappeared from the industry
And in this wave of #MeToo movement in Taiwan
Many politicians, public figures, scholars
Lost integrity because of being exposed
left the original job
South Korean government even after poet Go Eun was accused of sexually harassing a poetess
Cancel his exhibition, remove his poetry from Korean textbooks
When Existing Legal Channels Cannot Give Justice to Victims
The #MeToo movement has become making the damage visible
Alternative Paths to Justice
So some objections criticize the #MeToo movement for not going through legal due process
Will be reduced to a mob trial, a public trial on the Internet
But the intent of the #MeToo movement
Internet public opinion is not intended to replace due process of law
but to open up a space
Respite for Victims Missed by the Law
Make social realities masked by unequal structures visible
So what structure of inequality masks these things?
When the Victim Is a Vulnerable Gender, Race or Child
their allegations are often dismissed
The opposite of
what people with power and a good public image say
more likely to be accepted by the public
<font color=#FFF600FF>Little Jane is speaking</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>He is going to take the tea in the cabinet</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>I accidentally touched you</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>But Yajing is the party involved</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>This matter should be viewed from her subjective feelings</font>
evil
<font color=#FFF600FF>Of course we have to try to be as clear and objective as possible</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>Ah, otherwise, you are also subjective, and he is also subjective</font>
it's here
We see what the philosopher Marinda Fricker said
Testimonial Injustice
because of the audience's gender bias
Biased to disbelieve the testimony of female victims
When a female victim files a complaint
will be asked to produce evidence
But when the accused male presented a counterargument
But no one will ask him to produce evidence
It seems that boys are more credible than girls
Study finds that police departments across the U.S.
There are 400,000 sets of rape evidence that have not been tested
Why even if there is evidence, the police do not want to do it?
Because 86% of those cases were non-white women
White women are sexually assaulted, the police will do it
Women of other races raped, police ignore
Police racism also brings injustice to testimony
This differential treatment of testimonies is tantamount to silencing girls and vulnerable groups
It's like how a father treats a little girl
What the child says is just gibberish, don't take it seriously
Dad can use many reasons to put off children
<font color=#FFF600FF>She has an abnormal fantasy about her father</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>I rejected her many times</font>
But actually
Children who have not yet been socialized by the patriarchal system
Instead, you can see things more clearly
Digging up the truth about the patriarchal system
Just like Rongzhi found out the secret of sexual humiliation hidden by his father
by contrast
Many adults are used to patriarchy
They will even help cover up and find reasons for men who have done wrong things
<font color=#FFD700FF>Your father just doesn't understand the differences between people</font>
<font color=#FFD700FF>He is more enthusiastic so it is easy to be misunderstood</font>
<font color=#FFD700FF>How do you know what I'm going to say? </font>
<font color=#FFD700FF>But those are not misunderstandings are true</font>
<font color=#FFD700FF>The conversation between him and that female assistant is very strange</font>
<font color=#FFD700FF>This is how men talk</font>
<font color=#FFD700FF>Uncle Cai often secretly harass me when you are not around</font>
<font color=#FFD700FF>That's why I will</font>
<font color=#FFD700FF>You talk nonsense</font>
<font color=#FFD700FF>If you didn't secretly seduce him</font>
<font color=#FFD700FF>How can he have the guts to pester you</font>
Boys don't need to provide evidence after being #MeToo
Many people will automatically speak for them
i believe in him
how could he do such a thing
testimony of injustice results
The result is that the masses collectively fall into a kind of "social ignorance"
So when #MeToo exploded
many men are shocked
It turns out that Taiwan society hides so many evil men
But the girl's reaction is not surprising
I have heard rumors
even encountered
Men's Privilege Is Not Needing to Know the Truth About Gender Oppression
You can still live in peace
And oppressed women know the truth about society
But it can only spread in private which villain to avoid
<font color=#FFD700FF>Fucking true death does not change</font>
<font color=#FFD700FF>He has harassed girls before in the organization department</font>
on experiences of gender oppression
women have more knowledge
Understand the workings of social reality better than men
So #MeToo is about letting the victims know the truth
Combating Testimony Injustice Through Collective Action
because when there's only one girl
When talking about your experience of being harassed
Boys can ignore her testimony
Said it was the girl who misunderstood herself and thought too much
But when a group of girls come out and say they've been harassed
Boys must collectively correct their cognition
Make it clear that you are the one who doesn't recognize reality
<font color=#FFD700FF>Don't be like this</font>
<font color=#FFD700FF>Our little Jane is not very good at getting along with little girls</font>
<font color=#FFD700FF>Please go back and talk to your sister</font>
<font color=#FFD700FF>Don't take it to heart</font>
it's here
We're seeing another argument in defense of men
boys are not harassing
It's just that I don't know how to get along with girls.
We should have more empathy for these men with social difficulties
But the strange thing is that the victim is obviously a woman
Why We Should Give Men More Compassion
Philosopher Kate Manne calls this state of mind "himpathy"
When many people talk about empathy, they only use it on boys
while excluding women
It's just a kind of "empathy", thinking that boys are more worthy of sympathy
If the same happens to girls
less worthy of sympathy
even blame women
Even after committing sexual harassment many men
In my own defense, I've been drinking to pieces.
I am also temporarily unconscious
But if today it was women who were sexually harassed after drinking
People will instead say that girls are indiscreet
Being picked up by a boy just deserves it
like in 2015
Brock Turner, a top student at Stanford University
Drunk schoolgirl raped after drink
The whole public opinion is in support of the man
Said to empathize with this drunk boy
he can't control himself
if the sentence is too severe
This Stanford top student's future is ruined.
In the end, the judge only sentenced him to 6 months in prison.
Because I am afraid that staying in prison for too long will affect the future of this talent
This kind of empathy only empathizes with boys' future
Not thinking about the future of the victimized women
Many women who have been sexually harassed and assaulted
live in shadow all my life
<font color=#FFF600FF>Primo Levi said a word</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>He said the concentration camp was the largest massacre in human history</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>But I say no</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>The largest massacre in human history is the rape of Fang Siqi</font>
ironnically
Many sexual harassment recidivists use girls' empathy to commit crimes
Boy deliberately pretends that his life is not going well
show your vulnerable side
Let the woman empathize with him and comfort him
Use this to create intimacy and then sneak in
and to be honest
He looked really pathetic back then
I think I should comfort him
I don't think he will do anything to me
so i patted him on the back
i didn't know he would misunderstand me
Empathy makes women victims
It also makes the public feel more sympathetic to male perpetrators
And even turn the blame on female victims
If we lose because of this
You will be treated as war criminals
I'm not happy seeing you make trouble like this
He is the one who caused the trouble, right?
Another focus of the #MeToo movement
is that many will blame the victim
Said they did not expressly refuse
that means agreeing
But what exactly is consent?
In an environment that emphasizes masculinity and male power
Men can take the initiative to attack women
If the woman refuses
Possibly in return for revenge from male superiors
Being bullied in every possible way in the workplace
<font color=#FFF200FF>If I specifically reply to the message and ask him not to do this</font>
<font color=#FFF200FF>I feel rather embarrassed</font>
<font color=#FFF200FF>It seems like I am making a fuss</font>
<font color=#FFF200FF>I don't want to break my relationship with him either</font>
The opposite of
People who follow the unspoken rules can go on in the industry
Receive benefits from male superiors
Women forced to obey unspoken rules
Doesn't mean they actually agree with the rules
In this environment of unequal power
Using consent as the criterion for sexual harassment
itself has problems
The philosopher Catherine Mackinnon pointed out that
Consent presupposes that both parties have equal power and both parties have free will to say no
But in workplaces and campuses where the power of men and women is highly unequal
Do students dare to say no to the teacher?
Do employees dare to say no to powerful colleagues and superiors?
<font color=#FFE500FF>Do you want to add Line</font>
<font color=#FFE500FF>This way next time you drop something</font>
<font color=#FFE500FF>I can notify you in the first second</font>
<font color=#FFE500FF>My phone is not with me</font>
<font color=#FFE500FF>Wait to add</font>
Even if their free will desires to refuse
But it is difficult to imagine the consequences of direct rejection
Don't dare to say no, don't agree
Sexual harassment incidents in the workplace and campus will be so rampant
because of unequal power relations
distorts the free expression of the disadvantaged
This power relationship is not only the cause of incidents of sexual harassment
It will even be further used to cover up sexual harassment incidents
But if the DPP knew about the sexual harassment in our party
Do you think they won't attack us with this matter?
So you also admit that this is a sexual harassment incident
Many supervisors and superiors have long known that it is a gender equality issue
But to protect the company's reputation and cover up the perpetrator
Fuda sexual assault case in 2015
It's also campus professors who want to maintain the reputation of the department
Instead, protect the perpetrator and cause secondary harm to the victim
This kind of power relationship does not only appear on campus and in the workplace
Easier to hide in intimate relationships undetected
<font color=#FFE100FF>If I didn't fall in love with him</font>
<font color=#FFE100FF>This will never happen</font>
Many boys think that the other half did not say no
So in love, it's all your love and my wish
But this ignores that even in love
men are privileged
If you don't give boys sexual satisfaction
even allowed him to make sex videos
The man can accuse the woman of not loving him enough
Women are the culprits that make men unhappy
As if satisfying a man is a woman's responsibility
This masculine privilege that hides in intimacy
Presupposes that a man's sexual desire is more important than a girl's sexual autonomy
But in an equal love relationship
Both men and women should have the right to say no
<font color=#FFE800FF>No one should live in fear</font>
<font color=#FFE800FF>Over the years</font>
<font color=#FFE800FF>Your pain is real</font>
<font color=#FFE800FF>The life you lost, the trust you destroyed</font>
<font color=#FFE800FF>These are all true</font>
<font color=#FFE800FF>So Zhang Yajing</font>
<font color=#FFE800FF>Stop thinking you are not qualified to seek justice for yourself</font>
After analyzing the various doubts in the #MeToo movement
we can think further
what we can do as men
After the emergence of the #MeToo movement in Europe and America
Many men decided to break their silence to show their support
Tag #IBelieveHer on social media posts and comments I believe in her
Men don't need to question victims' claims
Because the #MeToo movement turned to the community because it was hard to find evidence
and what we can do
is emotionally acknowledging that your pain is real
make the victim feel
This speaking space is safe
won't be attacked or suspected
this emotional support
Allows more victims to speak out about their experiences
And speaking the repressed truth can be healing in itself
Actively believe what the victim says
It will also change the men themselves
Because the act itself shows that you are willing to listen to the victim's testimony
Your actions are breaking the injustice of testimony
We should even be on this #MeToo wave
Further change gender inequality in patriarchal culture
Philosopher Simone de Beauvoir pointed out
in a patriarchal society
Boys' sexual enlightenment is discovery
To be a man means to be a hunter
A man who can pick up girls is a real man
A boy who can't get a girl is a snake
Patriarchal culture defines men as predators and women as prey
men who do not live up to these expectations
And more likely to resent and become a misogynist
Violence and verbal discrimination against women
by contrast
The fear of being possessed by women in a patriarchal society
because from a girl to a woman
It means you have become a prey
But how to change this patriarchal structure?
Let's think about in everyday life
How Sexually Oppressive Behavior Is Reproduced
for example on campus
Full of male students who regard women around them as sexual fantasies
Male students gather together to discuss the body shape of the women around them
like hunting for prey
The point is not to have sexual fantasies
It's about whether their actions make girls feel like they're in a safe space
Or many men like to tell discriminatory remarks, pornographic jokes
thought it showed himself as a humorous man
<font color=#FFF500FF>Holding the head of a turtle with eyes</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>Cute</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>Disgusting ghost, don't talk about those 543 things</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>You are a beautiful woman</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>The organization department is full of stinky boys</font>
After each controversy erupts
The problem is always wrongly focused on
this is my freedom of speech
You women just don't have a sense of humor
the real problem is
Why do some viewers find such jokes funny?
<font color=#FFF500FF>Let’s start with this lady</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>After you go back first, help me think carefully</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>I know it doesn't matter if my daughter is by my side</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>How to rape him tonight</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>Promise me, Promise me</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>That father over here promised me one thing</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>After you go back tonight, think about it</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>How can you thank me</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>You are welcome, you are welcome</font>
when the audience laughs collectively
They are actually encouraging this kind of joke to continue to exist in society
It also inadvertently continued the patriarchal oppression of women
If this is the case with the males that young boys see every day in everyday culture
then be a man
It's natural to become someone like this
<font color=#FFDC00FF>Men are fighting for the economy outside, women are quiet</font>
To transform the gender oppression of patriarchy is to make everyone understand
You can live a meaningful life without teasing, exploiting women, or sexual minorities
we need to clarify a concept
Feminism, feminism is not about attacking men to gain power
This misconception originated in 1969
A group of middle-class white women published the Redstockings (red stockings) manifesto
Declare that all men are enemies
But this position has long been criticized by many feminists
The truth is boys are oppressed by gender too
May also be sexually assaulted, sexually harassed, and given a yellow accent
What really needs to change is the patriarchal structure
and the toxic masculinity promoted by society
Feminism is not about crushing men
Everyone on the contrary can be a feminist
As we collectively reflect on the oppression of a patriarchal society
We are developing what feminist Bell Hooks calls a "collective critical consciousness"
For example, after the #MeToo movement broke out
A Swedish male professor publishes in the Guardian
Feelings and shocks when I first came into contact with feminist ideas
Recognize that you are male
How ignorant you are about gender issues
and encourage other men
Read Feminist Classics Together
This kind of self-reflection is dismantling patriarchy
And American Hollywood actor Justin Baldoni found other entertainers
Have an honest male conversation
This Gender Awakening Group Conversation
Can make men self-critical
We can even let women lead
Retrofitting Toxic Masculinity
It's up to girls to define what kind of behavior and interaction are the characteristics of a good man
<font color=#FFF500FF>What I need is that you can understand what I want</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>I want you to listen to me</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>These are very small things</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>But these very small things</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>It is as important as Taiwan's future</font>
After the #MeToo movement began in 2018
Men in European and American countries are beginning to learn to update the way they interact with women
The British Guardian has a new column
The New Age Dating Guide for Teaching Men
If you look closely, in pop culture
The expression of intimacy between men and women has also changed dramatically over the past half century
in the movie 40 years ago
Forcibly kissing a girl after being rejected by her
will not be questioned
Men will think it's manly and romantic
but in today's
shoot the same bridge
It has been questioned by women as sexual harassment
Reflects society's overall gender awareness has shifted
Harnessing the power of the #MeToo movement
Taiwanese should start a movement for sexual peace revolution together
18th century feminist Mary Wollstonecraft proposed a thought experiment
let's imagine
In the future, women can be educated and become government officials just like men
This would have been an unrealistic fantasy 200 years ago
But in today's society, it has long been taken for granted that
No one will deny women's right to education and suffrage
We can now also do a thought experiment
What does the gender-equal future that Taiwanese want look like?
Can this fantasy come true?
It depends on our efforts in the next 10 or 20 years
<font color=#FFF500FF>Know the things that make you uncomfortable</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>It is also happening in every corner of Taiwan</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>I will fire those who hurt you</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>But I know I'm not doing enough</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>Please wait for the day when this society catches up with you</font>
<font color=#FFF500FF>I will move forward for this goal</font>
Countries around the world are reeling from the #MeToo movement
revolutionized sexual justice
When #MeToo broke out in South Korea in 2018
270,000 people petitioned the government to severely punish criminals who spread sex videos
Tens of thousands of women took to the streets
It turns out that many unknown gender oppressions in society happen every day
Women's collective awakening demands that their voices be heard by the whole society
now is the time
Taiwanese must face up to women's voices
It has been less than 20 years since Taiwan passed the Sexual Harassment Prevention Law in 2005
but in the past 20 years
Gender oppression continues in Taiwan
Victims' voices are not heard by society
Now there are finally a group of brave victims
Use a me too to arouse public awareness
Now we as the masses
You can also use #IBelieveHer to reverse the injustice of the testimony
As long as we are willing to take the first step
to listen to women's voices
Men can learn from it
self-criticism, collective reflection
Let's break down the patriarchal system that hurts every day
This process is an opportunity for society to heal collectively
Women's voices will make the progress of Taiwan society happen
