Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 All
 Thoughts
 Podcast.
 I'm
 Tracy


Aloway


>> and
 I'm
 Joe
 Wisenthal.
 Joe,
 do
 you


remember
 earlier
 this
 year?
 There
 was
 a


moment
 when
 everyone
 got
 really
 excited


about
 Europe
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in


probably
 decades.


>> See,
 you
 know,
 it's
 I
 always
 think
 about


is
 uh
 for
 the
 two
 of
 us
 for
 a
 long
 time


of
 our
 careers,
 one
 of
 the
 sub
 many
 sub


themes
 that
 we
 go,
 it's
 like
 when
 is


Europe
 going
 to
 turn
 on
 the
 fiscal
 tabs?


When
 are
 they
 going
 to
 start
 spending


money
 in
 Germany?
 All
 these
 questions,


when
 are
 they
 going
 to
 be
 less
 so


focused
 on
 austerity
 or
 balanced


budgets,
 etc.
 And
 then
 finally,
 and


maybe
 Trump
 had
 something
 to
 do
 with
 it


and
 defense
 spending
 had
 something
 to
 do


with
 it
 or
 politics
 is
 finally
 we're


getting
 spending.
 There
 was
 like
 five


minutes
 and
 everyone
 was
 really
 excited


about
 some
 of
 the
 defense
 stocks
 and
 the


euros
 railing
 and
 it
 looked
 you
 know
 a


little
 bit
 more
 politically
 stable


perhaps
 than
 the
 US.
 What's
 happening


though?
 I
 like
 how's
 that
 going?
 I'm
 not


sure.
 I
 haven't
 followed
 it
 as
 closely


as
 I
 should
 have.


>> I
 will
 say
 I
 mean
 the
 euro
 is
 still


pretty
 strong
 against
 the
 dollar
 and
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 euro
 stocks
 that's
 still


doing
 pretty
 well
 as
 well.
 So
 there
 is


some
 optimism
 that
 is
 still
 circulating


the
 market.
 But
 you're
 absolutely
 right.


We
 should
 talk
 about
 what
 this
 means.


What
 does
 it
 actually
 mean
 for
 Europe
 to


quote
 unquote


>> seize
 this
 moment,
 right?
 This
 very


particular
 moment.
 And
 what
 exactly
 does


Europe
 want
 to
 achieve?


>> Totally.
 And
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 the


conversations
 that
 we
 have
 in
 the
 US


context
 certainly
 apply
 in
 the
 European


context.
 So
 industrial
 competition
 with


China,
 whatever
 we're
 feeling
 here
 in


the
 US,
 certainly
 very
 heightened


anxiety
 in
 Europe
 with
 the
 stress
 on
 the


auto
 industry
 and
 the
 chemicals
 industry


and
 so
 forth.
 Energy
 prices,
 obviously


electricity
 costs
 in
 the
 US
 becoming
 a


major
 topic,
 etc.
 Just
 as
 big
 in
 Europe,


if
 not
 bigger,
 especially
 in
 the
 wake
 of


the
 Ukraine
 war,
 the
 shutting
 off
 of
 the


nuclear
 power
 plants
 in
 some
 countries,


etc.
 So
 pretty
 much
 everything
 that


we're
 sort
 of
 wrestling
 with
 here,
 the


rise,
 the
 sort
 of
 productivity,


regulation,
 the
 splintering
 of
 the


traditional
 parties
 within
 domestic


politics,
 uh,
 our
 parties
 have
 a
 bit


more
 of
 a
 monopoly
 than
 the
 European


ones
 do,
 but
 there's
 similar
 stresses


going
 on.
 So
 anything
 that
 we're
 talking


about
 here,
 it's
 very
 useful
 to
 see
 how


it
 comes
 across
 from
 the
 European
 lens.


>> Absolutely.
 So
 I'm
 very
 happy
 to
 say
 we


do
 in
 fact
 have
 the
 perfect
 guest.
 We're


going
 to
 be
 speaking
 with
 Oi
 Ren.
 He
 is


of
 course
 the
 governor
 of
 the
 Bank
 of


Finland.
 He
 is
 also
 a
 governing
 council


member
 over
 at
 the
 ECB.
 So
 Olly,
 thank


you
 so
 much
 for
 coming
 on
 a
 thoughts.


>> Thanks
 very
 much
 for
 the
 invitation.


Great
 to
 be
 here.


>> So
 from
 your
 seat
 in
 Europe,
 wait,
 where


are
 you
 actually
 based
 in
 Europe?
 Where


do
 you
 spend
 most
 of
 your
 time?


>> I
 have
 a
 dual
 life,
 not
 schizophrenic


dual
 life.
 I
 have
 two
 home
 fields,
 two


home
 teres.


Finland,
 the
 bank
 of
 Finland
 is
 the


national
 central
 bank
 of
 Finland.
 But
 we


also
 at
 the
 same
 time
 we
 are
 member
 a


member
 of
 the
 Euro
 system
 and
 my
 second


home
 teran
 is
 thus
 Frankfurt
 and
 the


governing
 council
 of
 the
 ECB
 and
 the


same
 goes
 for
 the
 large
 part
 of
 our


civil
 servants
 economists
 and
 lawyers
 at


the
 bank
 of
 Finland
 like
 in
 the
 other
 19


national
 central
 banks
 that's
 the
 euro


system.


>> Perfect.
 So
 from
 your
 seat
 in
 Helsinki


and
 Frankfurt
 does
 it
 feel
 like


something's
 changed
 within
 Europe?
 Does


it
 feel
 like
 there
 is
 this
 sense
 that


maybe
 the
 current
 time
 period
 is
 some


sort
 of
 opportunity?


>> Certainly
 things
 have
 changed
 in
 Europe


a
 lot
 for
 the
 worse
 as
 we
 know
 because


of
 Russia's
 unjustified
 brutal
 war
 in


Ukraine.
 But
 second
 as
 a
 wake
 up
 to
 that


situation
 including
 the
 impact
 of


President
 Trump
 as
 well.
 And
 I
 will
 say


that
 if
 you
 look
 at
 Europe
 for
 the


moment,
 we
 have
 one
 issue
 which
 is
 above


others
 and
 that
 is
 common
 defense
 and
 uh


spending
 on
 common
 defense
 from
 air


defenses
 to
 drone
 production
 and
 other


elements
 of
 military
 technology
 and


production.
 And
 that's
 also
 very
 much
 an


economic
 issue
 actually.
 It's
 a


financial
 opportunity
 in
 a
 sense
 that


the
 best
 argument
 for
 safe
 assets
 in


Europe
 is
 indeed
 defense
 spending.
 We


need
 both
 national
 and
 European
 funding.


This
 is
 in
 my
 view
 a
 possibility
 to
 pave


the
 way
 for
 a
 deep
 and
 liquid
 European


capital
 market.
 That's
 great.
 I'm
 glad


we
 jump
 right
 into
 this
 question
 of


further
 integration
 and
 the
 some
 of
 the


stakes
 here
 particularly
 as
 it
 relates


to
 defense
 because
 this
 has
 been


something
 that's
 been
 on
 my
 mind
 a
 lot


and
 I
 wanted
 to
 get
 in
 with
 you.
 When


we're
 thinking
 about
 industrial
 capacity


or
 think
 about
 industrial
 competition,


scale
 is
 really
 important.
 the
 size
 of


the
 market
 is
 very
 important
 and
 this
 is


part
 of
 the
 whole
 premise
 of
 the
 Euro


area
 which
 is
 let's
 have
 an
 integrated


market
 and
 yet
 on
 the
 other
 hand


domestic
 politics
 are
 still
 a
 thing
 I


have
 to
 imagine
 in
 defense
 specifically


there
 must
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 anxiety
 at
 each


individual
 country
 do
 we
 want
 our


national
 maker
 of
 X
 rolled
 up
 into
 some


larger
 conglomerate
 to
 what
 ex
 degree


whether
 we're
 talking
 about
 defense
 or


other
 any
 other
 industrial


any
 other
 industrial
 sector.
 Does
 there


still
 remain
 a
 tension
 between
 the
 scale


required
 for
 competitiveness
 and
 the


desire
 for
 some
 sovereignty
 within
 each


country
 to
 have
 their
 maker
 of
 X
 or
 Y?


>> Yes,
 there
 is
 that
 tension
 but
 that's


why
 we
 do
 we
 make
 policy
 and
 that's
 why


we
 try
 to
 change
 things
 in
 in
 Europe.
 Uh


actually
 that
 brings
 to
 my
 mind
 an


anecdote
 concerning
 precisely
 common


defense
 how
 things
 have
 changed.


>> Okay.
 The
 country
 I
 know
 best,
 Finland,


joined
 NATO
 in
 April
 2023.


And
 I
 recall
 my
 own
 time
 in
 military


service
 in
 the
 19
 early
 1980s


in
 the
 Savo
 Brigade
 in
 eastern
 Finland


in
 the
 city
 which
 used
 to
 be
 the


headquarters
 of
 Man
 Manrahim
 during
 the


winter
 war.
 Today
 that
 garrison
 area
 is


actually


a
 regional
 sub
 headquarters
 of
 NATO.
 So


you
 see
 the
 change
 in
 uh
 in
 terms
 of


defense
 in
 this
 regard
 in
 Northern


Europe
 talking
 about
 economies
 of
 scale.


Yes.
 We
 lack
 a
 genuine
 single
 market
 in


many
 areas
 like
 services
 and
 to
 some


extent
 capital
 and
 that's
 why
 we
 are


very
 committed
 to
 move
 forward
 with
 for


instance
 the
 savings
 and
 investment


union
 which
 aims
 at
 say
 transforming
 the


formidable
 savings
 of
 Europeans
 10


trillion
 that's
 the
 estimate
 to


productive
 investment
 by
 some
 kind
 of


say
 popular
 capitalism


that's
 in
 my
 view
 one
 essential
 element


of
 creating
 a
 more
 unified
 Europe
 and


creating
 a
 more
 competitive
 Europe.


>> The
 other
 thing
 when
 it
 comes
 to


building
 up
 a
 defense
 industry
 that
 is


sometimes
 debated
 is
 this
 idea
 of
 should


you
 spend
 money
 on
 investing
 in
 defense


programs
 or
 should
 you
 spend
 money,
 you


know,
 buying
 the
 products
 that
 these


defense
 companies
 are
 actually
 producing


because
 what's
 the
 point
 of
 building
 out


this
 massive
 capacity
 if
 you
 don't
 have


a
 dependable
 customer
 for
 the


foreseeable
 future?
 How
 would
 you


structure
 that
 sort
 of
 spending
 to
 make


sure
 that
 it's
 durable
 I
 guess
 and


effective?


>> That's
 a
 very
 critical
 question
 in
 the


European
 context
 and
 that's
 why
 as
 we


are
 conducting
 joint
 European
 uh
 funding


exercises
 in
 this
 regard
 like
 the


150
 billion
 euro
 safe
 instrument
 by
 the


European
 Commission.
 It's
 essential
 that


we
 purchase
 those
 arms
 and
 arms


technologies
 by
 common
 procurement
 and


by
 investing
 in
 joint
 research
 and


innovation
 projects.
 That's
 the
 way
 to


get
 more
 bang
 for
 the
 euro
 and
 that's


now
 the
 effort
 which
 the
 European


countries
 and
 and
 the
 commission
 are


engaged
 with.
 In
 fact,
 it
 is
 clear
 it's


quite
 clear
 that
 we
 are
 going
 to
 in
 in


Europe,
 we
 are
 going
 to
 purchase
 both


say
 domestic
 European


products
 and
 also
 American
 products.
 In


some
 areas,
 the
 US
 is
 more
 advanced.
 For


instance,
 Finland
 is
 purchasing
 64
 F-35s


to
 replace
 our
 existing
 fleet
 of
 64


F-18s
 which
 date
 from
 the
 early
 1990s.


>> How
 costly
 is
 it?
 I
 guess
 to
 put
 it


bluntly,
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 the
 US
 is
 not


the
 reliable
 trading
 partner
 it
 might


have
 seemed
 to
 be.
 I
 mean,
 I
 know


there's
 still
 a
 lot
 of
 trade.
 You
 just


mentioned,
 you
 know,
 replace
 the
 plane


fleet,
 etc.
 But
 clearly,
 we
 all
 read
 the


news.
 We
 all
 know
 what's
 going
 on.
 How


costly
 is
 it
 for
 Europe?
 Do
 you
 perceive


there
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 frankly
 unnecessary


duplications
 of
 investment
 efforts


across
 the
 Atlantic
 currently
 because
 of


trade
 tensions?
 We
 do
 expect
 that
 and


that's
 uh
 having
 a
 negative
 impact
 on


productivity
 and
 thus
 on
 the
 economy


growth
 and
 and
 well-being.


As
 far
 as
 the
 impact
 of
 US
 tariffs
 is


concerned,
 we
 have
 tried
 to
 estimate


that
 it's
 a
 bit
 difficult
 as
 policym
 is


fairly
 volatile.
 So
 it
 depends
 on
 the


day
 or
 the
 week.


>> We've
 known
 when
 you
 take
 the
 cut
 off


cut
 off
 data.


>> Yeah,


>> you
 know
 that
 perhaps
 but
 uh
 our


estimate
 which
 is
 roughly
 done
 on
 the


basis
 of
 the
 current
 US
 tariff
 regime
 is


that
 it
 will
 hit
 growth
 in
 the
 Euro
 zone


roughly
 by
 half
 a
 percentage
 point
 next


year.
 But
 the
 good
 news
 is
 that
 the


European
 economy
 is
 actually


demonstrating
 resilience.
 We
 are
 still


growing
 this
 year
 probably
 around
 1%
 or


so
 1.2%


and
 we
 are
 projected
 to
 grow
 by
 one
 1.3%


in
 the
 next
 two
 years
 despite
 the


headwinds
 of
 both
 geopolitical
 tensions


and
 tariff
 wars.
 So
 you
 wrote
 something


for
 Vox
 a
 few
 months
 ago
 called
 Europe


must
 not
 waste
 its
 currency
 moment
 and


you
 know
 reading
 it
 it
 sounds
 very
 much


like
 there's
 perhaps
 an
 ambition
 to


maybe
 replace
 some
 of
 the
 influence
 or


some
 of
 the
 global
 role
 of
 currently


fulfilled
 by
 the
 US
 and
 the
 dollar
 with


the
 euro.
 Is
 that
 how
 we
 should
 be


reading
 it?
 Is
 there
 like
 a
 conscious


effort
 underway
 currently
 to
 expand
 the


euro's
 influence
 in
 the
 world?


>> There
 is
 a
 deliberate
 conscious
 effort


to
 enhance
 uh
 the
 euro's


global
 role
 in
 the
 currently
 changing


international
 monetary
 system.
 And
 if
 I


put
 the
 background
 first,
 I
 think
 we
 are


seeing
 the
 international
 monetary
 system


or
 the
 global
 financial
 system
 in


transformation
 for
 the
 moment.


And
 you
 have
 two
 main
 drivers
 in
 broad


sense.
 On
 one
 hand
 the
 geopolitical


confrontation
 and
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 we


have
 a
 technological
 disruption
 thanks


to
 digital
 assets,
 cryptos,
 stable


coins,
 central
 bank
 digital
 currencies.


How
 this
 will
 play
 out
 will
 be
 quite


crucial
 as
 to
 the
 evolution
 of
 the


monetary
 system.
 Concerning
 the


geopolitical
 competition,
 we
 see
 China's


efforts
 to
 strengthen
 the
 role
 of
 remim


or
 the
 UN
 for
 instance
 with
 the
 road
 and


belt
 initiative
 and
 linking
 trade


agreements
 to
 a
 to
 an
 enhanced
 role
 of


of
 the
 UN
 but
 uh
 and
 there's
 a
 major
 but


uh
 there
 are
 still
 capital
 controls
 in


China
 and
 there
 is
 no
 legal
 certainty
 in


China
 in
 the
 in
 the
 western
 sense.
 So
 uh


that
 creates
 quite
 significant


limitations
 for
 the
 rem


in
 the
 technological
 side.
 We've
 seen


the
 growth
 of
 stable
 coins
 more


recently.
 We've
 seen
 certain
 volatility


of
 cryptos
 last
 week
 last
 Friday.


>> Just
 a
 little


>> just
 a
 little.
 Yes.
 And
 uh
 for
 instance,


stable
 coins,
 they
 are
 clearly
 intended


to
 increase
 demand
 for
 US
 treasuries
 to


fill
 the
 federal
 deficit
 of
 the
 United


States
 of
 America
 and
 thus
 to
 enhance


the
 role
 of
 US
 dollar
 and
 US
 dollar


dominance.
 I
 believe
 that
 on
 the
 basis


of
 historical
 experience
 let's
 say
 for


instance
 by
 the
 writings
 of
 professor


Barry
 Ahen
 Green
 of
 Z
 Berkeley
 that


historical
 shifts
 in
 the
 international


monetary
 system
 take
 place
 slowly
 and
 on


the
 basis
 of
 the
 structural
 changes
 in


the
 economy
 and
 security
 structures.


That's
 why
 I
 believe
 that
 US
 dollar


dominance
 will
 prevail
 for
 quite
 long


perhaps
 less
 as
 a
 single
 uniolar


hedgeimmon
 in
 the
 monetary
 system
 than


before
 and
 we
 may
 move
 towards
 a
 more


multipolar
 monetary
 system
 and
 the
 euro


can
 have
 a
 significant
 reserve
 role


there
 on
 the
 condition
 that
 we
 can


strengthen
 the
 foundations
 of
 the


European
 economy
 in
 security
 in
 terms
 of


economy
 dynamism.
 And
 in
 terms
 of


digital
 sovereignity,


>> when
 it
 comes
 to
 economic
 dynamism,


people
 are
 pretty
 pessimistic
 about


Europe
 these
 days.
 They
 look
 at
 an


industrial
 sector
 that
 is
 maybe
 being


hobbled
 by
 a
 competition
 with
 China.


They
 see
 the
 country,
 the
 various


countries
 as
 not
 being
 at
 the
 forefront


of
 the
 AI
 investments.
 With
 tech
 in


general,
 there's
 a
 perception
 that
 the


economies
 are
 still
 overregulated.
 It's


not
 a
 great
 place
 to
 have
 a
 startup
 and


so
 forth.
 What
 is
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 bull


case
 or
 maybe
 the
 sales
 pitch
 for
 sort


of
 uh
 the
 eur
 Euro
 Inc.
 the
 European


economy?
 Where
 does
 growth
 come
 from
 in


a
 dynamic
 durable
 manner?


>> There
 is
 a
 vibrant
 startup
 community
 for


instance
 in
 Finland.


>> Yeah,
 Finland
 is
 actually
 Finland's


probably
 the
 exception.
 You
 do
 hear


about
 Finnish
 startups.
 Swed
 Sweden,


France,
 many
 other
 countries.
 We


actually
 we
 have
 a
 rather
 vibrant


startup


>> community
 in
 in
 Europe.


>> By
 the
 way,
 welcome
 to
 Slush.
 Even


though
 I'm
 not
 the
 organizer,
 but
 Slush


is
 the


>> well-known
 major
 conference
 in
 in


Helsinki.


>> We'd
 love
 to
 come
 to
 that.
 If
 you
 can


introduce
 us
 next
 26,
 we'd
 love
 to
 come.


>> That's
 the
 major
 startup.


>> That
 sounds
 great.


>> Global
 startup
 event
 since
 early
 2010s


roughly.


>> Okay,
 that's
 good
 to
 know.
 The
 name


slush
 comes
 from
 November
 because
 you


have
 so
 much
 slush
 in
 November.
 So


>> that's
 why
 it's
 called
 slush,
 but
 it's
 a


very
 bright
 event
 in
 the
 darkest
 part.


>> This
 is
 why
 everyone
 goes
 into
 the


saunas
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 time
 to
 get
 out


of
 the
 slush
 and
 stuff.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 do
 it
 12
 months
 per
 year,


few
 times
 per
 week.


>> Sounds
 great.
 It
 sounds
 fantastic.


>> Not
 bad.
 Not
 bad.
 But
 even
 more


seriously,
 so
 we
 have
 startups,
 we
 have


some
 unicorns.
 But
 the
 general
 challenge


in
 Europe
 is
 that
 in
 the
 scaleup
 phase,


many
 companies
 choose
 the
 US
 say
 Silicon


Valley
 or
 or
 New
 York
 Stock
 Exchange
 or


combination
 of
 both
 because
 it's
 easier


to
 get
 venture
 capital,
 you
 have
 a
 large


market
 which
 is
 culturally
 fairly


similar
 even
 though
 there
 are
 certain


differences
 between


>> California
 and
 and
 Helsinki.
 H
 thinking


of
 California
 and


>> say
 South
 Carolina


>> right
 yes
 okay


>> so
 in
 any
 case
 it's
 the
 scale
 of
 phase


and
 internationalization
 phase
 where
 we


have
 to
 do
 better
 and
 that's
 why
 for


instance
 our
 government's
 efforts
 to


enhance
 growth
 in
 Finland
 are
 very
 much


focused
 on
 funding
 of
 scaleups
 and


growth
 companies


[Music]


[Music]


So
 when
 I
 think
 about
 a
 business
 being


competitive,
 especially
 in
 the
 areas


that
 people
 seem
 to
 be
 very
 excited


about
 nowadays,
 things
 like
 AI,
 data


centers,
 I
 guess
 defense
 nowadays,
 I


think
 about


One
 aspect
 of
 competitiveness
 is
 price,


right?
 And
 if
 your
 input
 costs
 are


higher
 than
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 people,
 then


you're
 going
 to
 struggle
 to
 provide


these
 things
 at
 a
 low
 cost.
 And
 in


Europe,
 the
 big
 input
 costs
 that
 people


seem
 to
 struggle
 with
 is
 energy,
 right?


How
 in
 the
 world
 does
 Europe
 start
 to


compete
 in
 terms
 of
 global


competitiveness
 with
 energy
 prices
 so


high
 and
 what
 can
 you
 do
 about
 it?


We
 have
 have
 to
 go
 back
 have
 to
 go
 back


to
 Finland
 metaphysically
 mentally
 now


again
 because
 we
 we
 have
 an
 X
 number
 of


data
 center
 investments
 uh
 coming
 in


Finland
 mostly
 with
 for
 indirect


investment
 thanks
 to
 the
 combination
 of


relatively
 inexpensive
 electricity
 and


uh
 relatively
 cool
 climate
 which
 is


conducive
 for
 data
 centers.


So
 um
 in
 that
 sense
 there
 are


differences
 within
 Europe
 as
 well.
 The


key
 is
 very
 much
 to
 continue
 the
 green


transition
 with
 consistency


for
 the
 moment.
 Still
 countries
 like


Germany
 are
 suffering
 from
 higher


electricity
 and
 energy
 costs.
 That
 is


true
 largely
 because
 Germany
 was
 so


dependent
 on
 Russian
 fossil
 fuel


especially
 because
 it's
 energy
 intensive


chemical
 and
 other
 industries
 were
 have


been
 so
 so
 dependent
 but
 the
 green


transition
 is
 moving
 forward.
 We
 lean


much
 more
 on
 renewable
 energy
 than


before.


Of
 course,
 energy
 efficiency
 and
 smart


electricity
 systems
 play
 also
 a
 key
 role


here
 and
 I
 would
 expect
 that
 this
 green


transition
 will
 be
 I
 mean
 not
 concluded


but
 will
 be
 very
 far
 by
 the
 end
 of
 this


decade
 so
 that
 we
 have
 a
 much
 more


competitive
 condition
 in
 Europe.
 In
 this


regard,
 I
 add
 one
 thing.
 Often
 when
 you


compare
 fossil
 energy
 and
 you
 compare


you
 compare
 fossil
 energy
 to
 say


renewable
 energy,
 the
 capital
 costs
 in


uh
 renewables
 are
 often
 higher
 like
 say


investing
 in
 wind
 parks,
 wind
 or
 solar


energy,
 but
 the
 running
 costs
 are
 quite


low.
 Meanwhile,
 in
 fossil
 fuels,
 it's


often
 let's
 say
 the
 reverse.
 So
 that
 the


capital
 costs
 are
 not
 that
 huge
 but
 you


have
 very
 significant
 running
 costs.
 So


once
 you
 are
 far
 enough
 in
 the
 green


transition
 preferably
 supplemented
 by


nuclear
 energy
 in
 my
 view
 then
 our
 cost


competitiveness
 in
 terms
 of
 energy
 will


also
 be
 much
 better.


>> It
 sounds
 like
 the
 solution
 to
 some
 of


what
 ails
 Europe
 is
 just
 everyone
 needs


to
 be
 more
 like
 Finland.
 Sounds
 like
 you


guys
 have
 it
 figured
 out
 and
 everyone


else
 in
 uh
 Europe
 needs
 to
 be
 more
 like


that.
 No,
 for
 real.
 when
 it
 comes
 to


broad
 like
 like
 industrial
 pressure,
 can


you
 like
 attribute
 and
 maybe
 this
 is


more
 of
 a
 German
 specific
 question,
 but


I
 think
 it
 probably
 applies
 more


broadly.
 Is
 it
 possible
 to
 decompose
 the


degree
 to
 which
 competition
 with
 China,


especially
 things
 like
 chemicals,


China's
 very
 competitive
 chemicals,


though
 it
 doesn't
 get
 much
 attention


obviously
 cars
 globally
 is
 just
 a
 huge


story.
 When
 you
 look
 at
 like
 sort
 of
 the


sputtering
 out
 of
 industrial
 production


in
 Germany
 or
 just
 Europe
 more
 broadly,


is
 it
 possible
 to
 decompose
 how
 much
 of


it
 is
 undercutting
 on
 price
 from
 China


versus
 the
 higher
 costs
 that
 have
 surged


particularly
 since
 early
 2022?


>> Well,
 it's
 it
 is
 possible,
 but
 I
 don't


have
 the
 figures
 off
 the
 off
 the
 cuff.


But
 I
 recall
 that
 in
 uh
 2022
 which
 was


the
 high
 point
 of
 energy
 costs
 in


Europe.
 So
 we
 calculated
 with
 a
 friend


of
 mine
 and
 then
 we
 verified
 that
 by
 our


economists.
 That
 year
 Europe
 paid
 800


billion
 e
 for
 fossil
 fuels
 instead
 of


the
 long-term
 average
 of
 300.
 So
 we
 paid


500
 600
 billion
 euros
 more
 that
 year


which
 then
 was
 roughly
 3%
 of
 GDP.


So
 in
 22
 we
 had
 a
 you
 can
 uh
 say
 that
 it


was
 kind
 of
 an
 extra
 tax
 of
 every


European


of
 3%
 of
 the
 income
 on
 average


>> which
 of
 course
 created
 quite
 a
 lot
 of


popular
 opposition
 and
 criticism.


Fortunately,
 we
 have
 been
 uh
 it's
 not


actually
 about
 fortune,
 it's
 about


political
 will
 and
 action.
 We
 have
 been


able
 to
 broadly
 adjust
 uh
 to
 the
 end
 of


Russian
 gas
 in
 Europe,
 but
 we
 still
 have


some
 work
 to
 do
 in
 many
 countries.
 You


mentioned
 Germany.
 Germany
 still
 has


work
 to
 do
 in
 order
 to
 reduce
 its
 energy


costs
 in
 its
 industrial
 production.


If
 you
 could
 wave
 a
 magic
 wand
 and
 do


one
 thing
 to
 boost
 European
 either


productiveness,
 productivity
 or
 uh


competitiveness,
 basically
 make
 all
 of


Europe
 more
 like
 Finland.
 What
 would
 it


be
 other
 than
 installing
 saunas
 in


everyone's
 house?


>> That's
 a
 good
 idea
 actually,
 even
 though


fairly
 electricity.


>> Yeah,
 I
 was
 saying
 that's
 not
 helping


with
 the
 energy
 depending
 depending
 if


you
 use
 electricity
 or
 or
 wood
 in


heating.
 I
 have
 both
 in
 the
 summer.
 It's


wood
 by
 the
 lake.


>> So
 good.


>> More
 seriously.
 More
 seriously,
 if
 I


could
 do
 one
 thing,
 I
 would
 complete
 the


single
 market
 without
 the
 delay
 and
 also


create
 a
 genuine
 savings
 and
 investment


union
 with
 a
 deep
 and
 liquid
 capital


market
 because
 this
 would
 help
 address


the
 challenge
 of
 venture
 capital
 and


financing
 of
 European
 startups
 and


growth
 companies.


>> What
 would
 it
 do?
 What
 would
 that
 sort


of
 cohesive
 market
 do
 that
 you
 can't
 do


right
 now
 at
 a
 national
 level?
 Would
 it


just
 lower
 capital
 costs
 for
 everyone
 or


>> Well,
 for
 instance,
 concerning
 uh
 the


savings
 and
 investment
 union,
 you
 have


actually
 a
 long
 list
 of
 concrete


decisions
 that
 it
 will
 require,
 but
 the


key
 things
 are
 in
 many
 ways
 to
 have
 a


safe
 asset,
 a
 European
 safe
 asset
 which


would
 facilitate
 the
 creation
 of
 genuine


European
 capital
 market.
 And
 uh
 then
 in


addition
 to
 that
 there
 are
 quite


reasonable
 proposals
 of
 creating
 either


tax
 incentives
 or
 other
 decisions
 that


encourage
 people
 to
 invest
 people


meaning
 individual
 citizens
 and


households.
 Sweden
 actually
 is
 a
 very


good
 example
 of
 this.
 So
 that
 in
 Sweden


for
 instance
 you
 have
 a
 certain
 portion


of
 your
 retirement
 payments
 that
 you


have
 to
 invest
 to
 the
 stock
 market
 or


funds.


>> Oh
 I
 see.
 Yeah.
 which
 has
 helped
 to


create
 a
 culture
 of
 investment
 in
 Sweden


>> and
 we
 are
 actually
 even
 though
 Finland


was
 mentioned
 as
 a
 role
 model
 but
 we
 are


benchmarking
 Sweden
 in
 this
 regard


because
 they
 have
 the
 most
 vibrant


venture
 capital
 market
 also
 thanks
 to


this
 quite
 well
 functioning
 capital


market.


>> I
 mean
 it
 makes
 total
 sense
 that
 you


know
 I
 think
 of
 the
 Euro
 area
 or
 the


what
 whatever
 version
 of
 it
 we
 want
 to


talk
 about
 is
 it's
 an
 ongoing
 project.


It's
 always
 a
 work
 in
 progress.
 will


probably
 never
 be
 completely
 finished.


There's
 always
 more
 to
 do.
 But
 this
 to


my
 mind
 gets
 to
 the
 sort
 of
 like
 the


challenge
 of
 domestic
 politics,
 right?


And
 like
 we
 all
 see
 what's
 happening


here
 where
 October
 16th,
 our
 government


is
 shut
 down,
 but
 it
 feels
 like
 various


aversions
 of
 this
 stress
 are
 replicating


themselves
 across
 the
 sort
 of
 rich


developed
 western
 countries.
 France,


their
 government
 always
 seems
 to
 be
 like


two
 weeks
 away
 from
 collapsing.
 Who


knows
 if
 they'll
 have
 a
 government?
 I


don't
 know
 if
 Belgium
 has
 a
 government


these
 days.
 I
 think
 the
 Dutch
 have
 an


election
 coming
 up.
 Who
 knows
 what's


happening
 there.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 polls
 in


Germany,
 we
 all
 know
 that
 parties
 like


the
 AFD,
 which
 are
 in
 a
 very
 different


trajectory,
 are
 doing
 very
 well
 in
 the


polls
 there,
 etc.
 Like
 how
 much
 of
 the


Yeah,
 it's
 great
 to
 say
 like
 people
 here


in
 DC
 at
 these
 conferences
 and
 here
 at


Bloomberg
 love
 the
 idea
 of
 like


integrated
 markets,
 but
 how
 much
 is
 the


roadblock
 that
 you
 foresee
 to
 get
 to


where
 you
 want
 essentially
 the
 reality


of
 domestic
 electoral
 politics
 in
 each


of
 the
 member
 countries?


>> It's
 a
 continuous
 challenge
 and
 you're


right.
 So
 when
 you
 said
 that
 Europe
 or


the
 European
 Union
 or
 the
 Euro
 zone
 is
 a


community
 or
 community
 of
 states
 that
 is


in
 constant
 movement,
 I
 would
 wish
 that


it
 would
 be
 in
 a
 more
 more
 rapid


movement,
 but
 it
 is
 indeed
 an
 unfinished


business
 and
 will
 continue
 to
 be.
 So


that's
 why
 it
 is
 actually
 so
 so


fascinating
 and
 meaningful
 to
 work
 for


for
 Europe.
 on
 these
 two
 two
 brief


points.
 First,
 the
 political
 battles
 or


the
 political
 competition
 of
 the
 souls


of
 the
 people
 are
 done
 in
 Europe
 in
 the


member
 states.
 Yeah,
 national
 politics


are
 key
 here
 and
 that's
 why
 I
 have
 a


high
 regard
 for
 national
 politicians
 who


face
 this
 challenge
 in
 the
 town
 hall


meetings
 and
 in
 the
 social
 media
 or


elsewhere


>> and
 of
 course
 in
 in
 terms
 of
 policym.
 So


we
 have
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 such
 uh


concrete
 policies
 that
 help
 alleviate


the
 concerns
 of
 the
 citizens
 and
 boost


sustainable
 growth
 and
 job
 creation
 in


in
 Europe.
 That's
 the
 essence.
 Second


comment
 is
 that
 it's
 quite
 interesting


that
 even
 though
 we
 have
 had
 and


continue
 to
 have
 populist
 movements


challenging
 say
 the
 more
 centrist


parties
 in
 almost
 all
 countries
 of


Europe,
 still
 the
 European
 Union
 is


holding
 together


and
 it
 is
 structurally
 kind
 of


>> and
 it's
 still
 fairly
 popular,
 isn't
 it?


Like
 actually
 the
 polls
 still
 show
 a


fair
 amount
 of
 popularity
 of
 these
 like


multinational
 Europe.


>> It
 is
 it
 is
 for
 instance
 in
 France
 the


right-wing
 party
 AN
 has
 toned
 down
 its


criticism
 concerning
 the
 euro
 in
 recent


years


>> and
 Europe
 or
 in
 this
 case
 the
 European


Union
 works
 as
 a
 glue
 that
 helps
 to
 keep


together
 the
 policym
 structure
 of
 of


Europe.
 So
 in
 that
 sense
 uh
 it
 has
 a


certain
 impact
 kind
 of
 second
 level


reverse
 impact
 on
 domestic
 politics
 as


well.
 Quite
 illustrative
 is
 that
 in


Finland
 on
 Monday
 after
 many
 years
 of


discussion
 we
 were
 able
 to
 agree
 or
 the


eight
 parliamentary
 parties
 were
 able
 to


agree
 on
 a
 long-term
 commitment
 to


balanced
 budget
 and
 depth
 anchor
 which


is
 historic


>> and
 it
 is
 also
 respecting
 the
 EU
 fiscal


rules.
 Even
 the
 parties
 that
 have
 been


quite
 critical
 on
 Europe
 are
 part
 of


this
 agreement
 which
 in
 my
 view
 is


actually
 quite
 encouraging.


[Music]


Earlier
 this
 year,
 everyone
 got
 very


excited
 about
 Germany
 finally
 wanting
 to


spend,
 right?
 we
 weren't
 going
 to
 be


terrorized
 by
 the
 Black
 Zero,
 the


Schwarzene
 forever.
 Do
 you
 get
 the
 sense


that
 things
 are
 changing
 in
 other


countries?
 Because
 again,
 here
 in
 the


US,
 the
 headlines
 we
 see
 for
 a
 place


like
 France
 is
 worries
 over
 the
 deficit,


political,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 say


incoherence,
 but
 certainly
 a
 little
 bit


of
 political
 chaos.
 Does
 it
 feel
 like


all
 of
 the
 Euro
 zone
 is
 becoming
 more


comfortable
 with
 the
 idea
 of
 spending


for
 strategic
 purposes
 at
 this
 moment
 in


time
 or
 is
 it
 primarily
 still
 Germany?


>> It
 is
 primarily
 majority
 of
 of
 the


member
 states
 but
 you
 are
 right
 there
 is


a
 certain
 variety
 of
 concerning
 the


emphasis
 and
 Germany
 plays
 a
 key
 role


here.
 The
 decisions
 of
 the
 German


government
 and
 in
 fact
 German
 government


and
 opposition
 earlier
 this
 year
 are
 now


taking
 effect.
 They
 have
 budgetary
 laws.


So
 they
 will
 be
 implemented.
 That's


critical.
 But
 so
 other
 countries
 like


all
 the
 Nordics,
 the
 Nordics
 together


are
 27
 million
 people
 and
 relatively


wealthy
 area
 in
 on
 in
 the
 globe
 and
 all


the
 Nordic
 countries
 are
 expanding
 their


defense
 expenditure
 significantly.
 So


are
 all
 the
 Eastern
 European
 countries


and
 several
 of
 the
 Western
 European


countries.


So
 overall
 the
 picture
 is
 I
 would
 say


encouraging.


I
 don't
 shout
 for
 victory
 yet,
 but
 uh
 we


are
 on
 the
 right
 right
 road
 here.


>> You
 know,
 it's
 really
 great
 to
 have
 you


on
 the
 podcast
 because
 um
 both
 Tracy
 and


I
 covered
 the
 Eurozone
 crisis
 of
 the


early
 the
 first
 half
 of
 the
 2010s
 quite


intensely.
 There
 are
 numerous
 headlines


that
 you
 would
 make
 news
 and
 I
 saw
 your


name
 and
 numerous
 headlines
 over
 that


time
 and
 maybe
 next
 time
 you
 come
 on
 I


would
 love
 to
 just
 like
 do
 an
 hour
 and


just
 talk
 about
 that
 time
 provided
 we


don't
 want
 to
 give
 you
 like
 euro
 crisis


PTSD
 etc.
 But
 I
 do
 have
 one
 there,
 you


know,
 I
 have
 a
 million
 questions
 about


what
 that
 time
 was
 really
 like,
 but
 I


was
 talking
 about
 this
 with
 someone
 last


night.
 You
 know,
 as
 the
 crisis


metastasize
 over
 time,
 there
 all
 these


we're
 going
 to
 introduce
 a
 new
 bailout


fund
 and
 I
 forget
 acronym
 after
 acronym


stability


>> mechanism
 like
 yeah
 all
 these
 acronyms


and
 acronym
 soup.
 Yeah.
 But
 then
 the


crisis
 ended
 essentially
 on
 the
 day
 that


Mario
 Draghi
 said
 that
 sovereign
 spreads


were
 an
 impediment
 to
 monetary


transmission.
 And
 once
 he
 said
 that


closing
 spreads
 were
 sort
 of
 mandate


consistent
 with
 the
 ECB,
 from
 then
 on


everything
 that
 was
 it.
 That
 was
 the


moment
 that
 the
 crisis
 really
 turned.


Couldn't
 that
 have
 happened
 a
 lot


earlier?
 Was
 there
 a
 lot
 of
 unnecessary


pain
 that
 was
 incurred
 in
 Europe
 because


it
 took
 so
 long
 to
 sort
 of
 get
 to
 the


point
 that
 the
 ECB
 could
 find
 a
 way
 that


it
 was
 within
 its
 remit
 to
 close


spreads?


I
 think
 it's
 a
 legitimate
 question
 and
 I


have
 been
 thinking
 about
 that
 quite
 a


lot.
 I
 have
 actually
 answered
 to
 this


question
 in
 my
 book
 called
 walking
 the


high
 wire


>> which
 is
 about
 the
 Euro
 zone
 crisis.


>> In
 fact,
 it
 is
 true
 that
 once
 Mario
 said


his
 now
 legendary
 words
 whatever
 it


takes
 within
 our
 mandate


>> to
 save
 the
 euro


>> then
 the
 animal
 spirits
 uh


>> that
 was
 it.
 turned
 around
 and
 the


market
 started
 to
 believe
 that
 the
 ECB


is
 functioning
 as


>> the
 central
 bank
 must
 function
 as
 the


lender
 of
 last
 resort.


>> That
 was
 the
 moment
 became
 a
 true


central
 bank.
 It
 was
 the
 moment
 became
 a


true
 central
 bank
 in
 some.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That's
 right.
 That's
 right.


And
 that's
 why
 before
 that
 it
 was
 kind


of
 incrementalist
 firefighting.
 This
 was


not
 without
 value
 because
 we
 were
 able


to
 keep
 the
 euro
 afloat
 and
 support
 many


countries
 Greece,
 Portugal,
 Ireland,


Spain


>> with
 the
 funding
 of
 the
 European


stability
 mechanism
 or
 its
 precursor.


>> In
 fact,
 now
 the
 countries
 that
 then
 the


then
 were
 in
 the
 EU
 IMF
 programs
 have


been
 in
 the
 past
 years
 they
 have
 been


one
 of
 the
 best
 performers
 in
 terms


totally
 flipped
 since
 the
 2010s.


So
 they
 have
 reformed
 their
 economic


structures
 to
 a
 large
 extent
 and
 they


are
 much
 more
 competitive
 for
 the
 moment


and
 their
 public
 finances
 are
 on
 a
 sound


basis.
 But
 there
 were
 years
 of
 pain
 in


Greece
 and
 particularly
 Italy
 as
 well


like
 truly
 like
 man
 like
 incredible


economic
 damage
 and
 by
 some
 measures


they
 would
 say
 like
 on
 par
 with
 the


great
 depression
 in
 the
 United
 States.


Could
 Europe
 have
 gotten
 to
 that
 point?


Could
 Mario
 Draghi
 have
 given
 the


whatever
 it
 takes
 speech
 in
 2009?
 Did
 it


have
 to
 wait
 as
 long
 as
 it
 did
 and
 all


these
 other
 mechanisms
 have
 to
 try


first?


>> Mario
 Draghi
 started
 as
 ECB
 president
 in


November
 2011.


>> Well,
 you're
 right.
 So
 there
 is
 no
 way


he
 could
 have
 given
 the
 speech
 in
 2009.


Could
 Jean
 clrice
 have
 given
 the
 speech


in
 2009?


>> You
 have
 to
 ask
 him.


>> But
 I
 guess
 my
 point
 is
 did
 it
 did
 all


could
 they
 have
 moved
 faster?
 Were
 all


of
 these
 steps
 necessary
 in
 which
 the


before
 the
 ECB
 as
 an
 institution
 got


comfortable
 with
 its
 role
 that
 it
 would


be
 much
 like
 the
 Fed
 and
 other
 central


banks
 some
 sort
 of
 backstopper
 lender
 of


last
 resort?
 Did
 the
 all
 did
 everything


else
 need
 to
 be
 tried
 first?


>> You
 are
 talking
 like
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 my


wife
 in
 the
 Sona
 during
 the
 Eurosone


crisis
 from
 2009
 onwards.
 So
 pretty
 much


I
 share
 your
 view.


>> Okay.
 And
 if
 you
 take
 a
 more
 let's
 say


historical
 view
 that
 so
 when
 the
 euro


was
 created
 then
 uh
 the
 kind
 of
 major


event
 like
 the
 euro
 zone
 depth
 crisis


was
 not
 perceived
 apparently
 in
 the


minds
 of
 the
 creators
 of
 the
 euro.


>> Yeah.


>> Because
 there
 was
 no
 stability
 mechanism


like
 the
 IMF.
 The
 European
 stability


mechanism
 is
 the
 IMF
 in
 the
 European


context.
 Actually
 the
 ESM
 has
 more


capital
 than
 the
 IMF
 total
 capital.


So
 that
 was
 not
 in
 existence
 when
 the


crisis
 hit
 we
 had
 to
 create
 in
 the
 run


in
 on
 the
 flight.
 Yeah.
 And
 uh
 the


second
 problem
 was
 that
 among
 the


economists
 there
 was
 much
 discussion


about
 whether
 the
 euro
 euro
 zone
 or
 the


economic
 monetary
 union
 is
 an
 optimal


currency
 area.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 macroeconomic
 imbalances
 and


financial
 stability
 issues
 were
 kind
 of


forgotten
 at
 the
 time.
 So
 very
 strong


focus
 also
 in
 the
 economist
 community.
 I


think
 that's
 something
 that
 deserves


some
 self-criticism
 among
 the
 economists


as
 well.


>> We
 have
 to
 do
 an
 episode
 just
 about
 the


Eurozone
 crisis
 at
 some
 point,
 but
 we


can't
 do
 it
 right
 now.
 So,


>> in
 our
 five
 minutes
 left,


>> in
 our
 five
 minutes
 left.
 So
 just
 going


back
 to
 the
 start
 of
 this
 conversation


which
 was
 about
 you
 know
 whether
 or
 not


this
 is
 a
 moment
 potentially
 for
 Europe


if
 Europe
 doesn't
 the
 Euro
 zone
 doesn't


successfully
 mount
 some
 of
 the
 changes


that
 you've
 discussed
 if
 it
 wastes
 this


current
 opportunity


what's
 the
 most
 likely
 path
 for
 the


block
 as
 a
 whole
 and
 then
 secondly
 how


would
 you
 know
 that
 Europe
 has
 kind
 of


achieved
 this
 global
 success


Are
 there
 things
 that
 you
 look
 out
 for?


Is
 it
 share
 of
 currency
 used
 in
 global


trade
 or
 something
 like
 that?


>> Well,
 first
 what's
 the
 measure?
 What's


the
 yard
 stick
 of
 measuring
 success
 of


say
 European
 economic
 policy?
 I
 think


fundamentally
 that
 is
 the
 well-being
 of


European
 citizens
 and
 say
 freedom,


entrepreneurship,
 well-being
 also
 social


protection
 of
 European


>> access
 to
 saunas.


>> Access
 to
 saunas.
 That's
 a
 basic
 human


right
 essential
 civil
 liberty.


>> Agree.
 My
 mom
 had
 a
 sauna
 when
 she
 was


in
 Estonia
 and
 it
 was
 amazing.


>> That's
 to
 the
 second
 part.
 But
 then
 the


first
 part,
 what
 if
 Europe
 won't
 be
 able


to


uh
 do
 the
 necessary
 things
 in
 order
 to


become
 stronger
 in
 terms
 of
 security
 and


and
 the
 economy?
 I
 guess
 some
 kind
 of


muddling
 through
 will
 will
 continue
 and


that
 is
 a
 very
 gloomy
 future
 for
 the


Europeans.
 So
 I
 would
 very
 much
 prefer


us
 stay
 united
 have
 the
 capacity
 of


renewal
 and
 and
 reform
 and
 thus
 gain
 the


required
 self-confidence
 to
 also
 gain
 a


stronger
 role
 in
 in
 global
 terms.


Finally
 I
 want
 to
 add
 that
 we
 are
 very


committed
 despite
 the
 current
 headwinds


we
 are
 facing
 in
 terms
 of
 geopolitical


tensions
 and
 trade
 wars.
 So
 we
 as


Europeans
 we
 are
 committed
 to


multilateral
 international
 cooperation


and
 we
 want
 to
 work
 together
 with
 our


partners
 the
 US
 global
 south
 and
 beyond.


I
 just
 have
 uh
 one
 last
 question.
 You


know,
 it
 feels
 like
 here
 in
 the
 US,
 I


sort
 of
 expect
 that
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 my


life
 that
 we
 will
 continue
 with
 some


sort
 of
 ongoing
 divorce
 with
 China.
 That


like
 we
 we're
 never
 going
 to
 go
 back
 to


the
 early
 2010s
 or
 the
 2000s
 where
 it


seemed
 like
 we
 could
 just
 be
 like


friends.
 Maybe
 I'm
 wrong,
 maybe
 I'm


being
 too
 pessimistic,
 etc.
 When
 you


think
 about
 the
 future
 of
 relation
 with


Europe
 and
 China,
 where
 do
 you
 see
 that


going?
 And
 especially
 again
 because
 our


president
 has
 obviously
 thrown
 up
 trade


barriers
 between
 the
 United
 States
 and


the
 Euro
 area.
 Is
 there
 a
 pivot
 to
 China


in
 the
 works?
 Could
 do
 could
 you
 see


that
 relationship
 over
 time
 actually


deepening?
 Like
 what
 are
 you
 thinking


about
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 trajectory
 of
 that


relationship
 because
 here
 it
 seems


terrible.


There
 is
 an
 ongoing
 discussion
 on
 that


in
 Europe
 both
 at
 the
 European
 level
 and


in
 the
 member
 states.
 You
 have
 two
 sides


of
 the
 coin.
 On
 one
 hand,
 Europe
 is


trading
 a
 lot
 with
 with
 China
 and
 it's


quite
 dependent
 on
 China,
 but
 it's
 a


mutual
 dependency
 in
 many
 ways
 and
 it's


a
 broadly
 free
 trade,
 not
 always
 so


fair,
 but
 free
 trade.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,


in
 China,
 the
 Communist
 Party
 has
 taken


stronger
 political
 control
 and
 China
 is,


let's
 not
 forget,
 China
 is
 supporting


Russia
 in
 its
 military
 actions,
 military


aggression
 in
 Ukraine.
 And
 that
 has


clearly


I'm
 not
 sure
 if
 the
 Chinese
 have
 fully


realized
 this,
 but
 that
 has
 clearly


seriously
 damaged
 the
 image
 of
 China
 in


Europe
 because
 we
 see
 that
 they
 are
 an


ally
 of
 Russia
 and
 they
 are
 trying
 to


with
 that
 alliance
 they
 are
 trying
 to


destroy
 our
 freedoms
 in
 Europe.


>> All right,
 Ollie
 Ren,
 thank
 you
 so
 much


for
 coming
 on
 thoughts.
 Really
 enjoyed


it.


>> Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 Thanks
 for
 the


discussion.


[Music]


Joe,
 that
 was
 really
 interesting
 to
 get


a
 European
 perspective.
 I
 got
 to
 say,


you
 know,
 saying
 that
 the
 EU
 could
 have


acted
 quicker
 on
 the
 debt
 crisis,
 I


think
 you
 could
 almost
 always
 level
 that


criticism
 at
 central
 banks.


>> And
 to
 some
 respect,


>> I
 mean,
 this
 is
 what
 we
 saw
 during
 the


financial
 crisis,
 right?
 So
 2008
 it
 took


a
 while
 for
 the
 Fed
 and
 everyone
 else
 to


realize
 what
 was
 going
 on
 and
 then
 they


came
 up
 with
 all
 these
 programs
 and
 then


when
 you
 had
 subsequent
 crises
 they


could
 roll
 them
 out
 really
 quickly.


>> You
 know
 it's
 like
 a
 cliche.
 Oh,
 you
 try


everything
 else
 until
 you
 get
 to
 the


right
 answer.
 It
 is
 total
 logical
 isn't


it?
 Isn't
 it?
 Of
 course
 no
 like
 I
 guess


by
 definition
 when
 you
 get
 to
 the
 last


thing
 you
 stop
 everything
 else
 by
 that


point.
 It
 still
 seems
 like
 they
 took
 a


while.
 And
 I
 have
 certainly
 never
 been


I've
 never
 asked
 a
 guest
 a
 question
 and


then
 been
 told,
 "Oh,
 I
 talked
 about
 this


in
 the
 sauna
 with
 my
 wife,
 this
 very


same
 topic."
 So,
 that
 was
 sort
 of
 a
 a


response
 I
 wasn't
 expecting.


>> You
 don't
 talk
 in
 the
 sauna
 with
 your


wife?


>> I
 just
 don't
 I
 just
 don't
 expect
 guests


to
 have
 had
 the
 same
 conversation
 with


their
 wife.


>> But
 I
 do
 think
 in
 general
 it
 does
 feel


like
 things
 are
 changing
 enormously.
 And


I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 still
 talk
 at
 this


point,
 but
 certainly
 speaking
 with


Ollie,
 you
 do
 get
 the
 sense
 that
 there


is


>> a
 conception
 in
 Europe
 that
 now
 is
 the


time
 when
 actually
 you
 kind
 of
 have
 a


news
 peg
 or
 an
 opportunity
 to
 actually


do
 some
 of
 the
 things
 you've
 said
 you


were
 going
 to
 do
 for
 a
 long
 time.


>> It's
 funny
 to
 think
 about
 policy
 makers


having
 a
 news
 peg
 as
 if
 they're
 like,


"Oh,
 let's
 do
 a
 podcast
 on
 this


episode."
 But


>> they're
 just
 waiting
 for
 the
 headline


now.
 Yeah,
 they're
 just
 waiting
 and
 then


they're
 going to
 do
 it.
 But
 like
 it
 does


feel
 like
 what
 whatever
 cliche
 you
 want


to
 use,
 the
 rubber
 is
 hitting
 the
 road.


There
 are
 serious
 constraints,
 right?


The
 econ
 the
 industrial
 economy
 is


deeply
 stressed.
 The
 energy
 situation
 is


stressed.
 President
 Trump
 is
 putting


trade
 stress.
 They
 have
 industrial


powerhouses
 that
 are
 like
 uh
 being


undercut
 by
 China
 or
 facing
 very
 stiff


competition
 with
 China.
 There
 is
 a
 war


going
 on
 in
 Europe.
 And
 as
 you
 mentioned


uh
 when
 thinking
 about
 the
 future
 of


China
 is
 the
 fact
 that
 uh
 China
 has
 been


a
 important
 trading
 partner


>> that
 was
 really
 interesting


>> that
 was
 very
 interesting.
 So
 you
 know


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 big
 issues
 that
 are


being
 forced
 upon
 Europe
 right
 now
 in


multiple
 directions
 whether
 we're


talking
 about
 the
 war
 whether
 we're


talking
 about
 trade
 whether
 we're


talking
 about
 President
 Trump.
 So
 if


they're
 gonna
 do
 something
 that
 sort
 of


changes
 the
 trajectory
 of
 the
 European


project,
 I
 see
 why
 now
 is
 the
 time.


>> It's
 not
 the
 rubber
 hitting
 the
 road,


Joe.
 It's
 the
 birch
 branch
 hitting


someone
 back
 in
 the
 sauna.
 That's
 what's


happening.


>> Ali
 that
 we
 had
 a
 title
 Ali
 Ren
 on
 the


birch
 branch
 hitting
 the
 back
 in
 Europe.


>> That's
 our
 title.


>> Let's
 leave
 it
 there
 before
 we
 go
 any


further.


>> All
 right,
 let's
 leave
 it
 there.
