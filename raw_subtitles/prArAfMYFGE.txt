We really developed the ideology that became what is called today fast casual. It wasn't very complicated. We began to look around and could see, it's been '92, '93, that one out of three consumers, one out of four consumers held their noses when they went into fast food. And you said, "What is it that they're looking for?" I know we spent a year or two on the road listening to people. And what you heard was that so many of these consumers, what they really thought was real food, environments that engage them, served by people that cared, and they actually wanted an experience that elevated their sense of self, not depleted it, which is what they experienced in fast food. And we began to say if we could create that kind of environment, we could create something that actually elevated people. (upbeat music)
