Philosophy with SuperY, it makes you cool
Each episode introduces you to a philosophical thinker
In the last episode, we talked about Aristotle's natural philosophy, metaphysics
In today's episode we're going to introduce his theory of human nature
ethics and politics
When we talk about human greed and human nature in our daily language
In fact, they are talking about the people they meet in life.
They cannot speak for all mankind
There is a way of talking about human nature in philosophy
It is to explore the difference between human beings and animals and plants
To understand the peculiarities of human beings
First of all, humans have one thing in common with animals and plants
that they are living organisms
Aristotle believed that all organisms have souls
This soul is the logos (essence) that determines the development of life
he's not talking like a christian soul
not first a lifeless body
Then the soul was blown into the body
aristotle says
People who think the soul goes in and out of the body are wrong
The soul and the body are actually two sides of the same body
Like a piece of wax in shape and material
The shape of wax cannot exist independently from the material of wax
The same person does not have the problem of separation of soul and body after death
The relationship between body and soul is like the relationship between eyes and vision
The essence of the eye is to see
So visual ability is the logos (essence) of the eyes
if one day you go blind
your eyeballs are still on your face
The material of the eyes has not changed
But the function of the eyes is lost
After death, only the corpse remains
But the logos of the soul are lost
To understand the difference between the souls of humans and animals and plants
It is necessary to observe the abilities of animals, plants, and human beings in real life.
First of all, plants have the lowest ability, etc.
Only absorb nutrients, reproduce
Again, animals are higher than plants
Because animals can feel, move
Humans are more advanced than animals
Because humans can reason abstractly
so understand human nature
we have to study these differences
Why do humans have sentience but plants do not?
Why do humans have rational abilities but animals do not?
Let's talk about perception
According to Aristotle, the characteristics of perception
is when people receive external stimuli
material can be filtered out
only retains the form and becomes an impression in the mind
like a metal stamp on a piece of wax
Will leave a mark and not leave a metal
so when you're watching the fireworks
What comes to your mind is the form of fireworks
rather than pyrotechnic material
Otherwise your brain will explode
What the human senses perceive is the form
this is very special
because plants have form
This form determines what kind of tree the seed will grow into
But the tree cannot perceive its own form
only people can
We can imagine a situation
In the forest a tree fell
but no one is aware of it
So, is there really the sound of a tree falling?
Aristotle's answer is
Suppose a tree falls and no one hears
The sound of this tree falling is only "potential"
only if it is heard by someone
This sound is the real "realization"
in other words
Forms perceived by humans are higher-order realizations
So we have to distinguish between different levels of potentiality and realization
A plant grows from a seed into a big tree
It is form that passes from potentiality to realization
the tree grew into itself
But the problem is that the tree is not aware of its own form
But that's okay
Because trees have the potential to be perceived
when one perceives the tree
The form of the tree has been realized at a higher level
As if everything in nature has a power
send signals to sentient humans
when they become part of human consciousness
their forms are realized at the highest level
The idea that human consciousness can realize the potential of all things
It was later used by physicist Heisenberg to explain quantum mechanics
Before the quantum is measured by the observer
exists in the state of probability waves
until the measurement action occurs
Probability Wave Collapse
The exact state of the quantum is "realized"
Heisenberg said:
"The concept of probability waves is actually the potential in Aristotle's philosophy"
Aristotle then went a step further
before being stimulated
Human senses are actually potential
For example, the tactile organ itself is neither hot nor cold
so you can feel the heat
Or people have black eyeballs and white eyeballs
But the images I see are neither black nor white.
Represents eye vision and does not have any colors built in
In order to faithfully restore the color of the world
in other words
vision is potential
Waiting to be touched by the form of all things
Human senses seem to be in the middle
If you encounter extreme values, such as too loud, too bright
organs will be damaged
This means that sensibility is derived from physical organs
aristotle thought
That rationality must not originate from physical organs
Because seeing the brightest light blinds the eyes
but pondering the deepest thoughts
but won't break the heart
On the contrary, it will make the soul deeper
So rationality must be a different existence from sensory perception
The difference between humans and plants lies in the ability to perceive
The difference between humans and animals lies in the rational ability
Animals have sentience
but subject to the senses
Only man can detect that the appearance seen by the senses is false
There is a reality behind it, a principle
You don't see animals doubting that the world is just an illusion
want to find the truth behind
? ? ?
The biggest difference between humans and animals
That is, animals can only be determined by nature
But man is driven by nature to understand his own nature
This knowledge enables one to go further beyond the limits of nature
So what exactly is rationality?
We can compare with sensibility
What the senses receive is the sensory form of a thing
Like the color and shape of a butterfly
But reason receives the essential form of a thing
like how a caterpillar turns into a butterfly
What is the life cycle behind
Rational abilities are higher than emotional abilities
Because the senses need stimulation from external objects
to form a feeling
But reason does not require the existence of an object
can also think at any time
So reason is the same as the senses
also a human potential
Only when you act on thinking does it become actualized
if you're rational but don't think
then you are like an animal
Not realizing the rational potential of human beings
for aristotle
This kind of person's soul level is relatively low.
Because it is human nature to desire to understand the world
so people who don't think
It's like not being a real person
Aristotle believed that everything has an essence
But only humans can contemplate the nature of things
so when they are rationally contemplated
achieve a higher level
For example, dinosaurs that ever existed in nature have only secondary realism
Dinosaur lore studied by biologists has a higher level of realism
that sounds weird
Why is it that human beings are relatively advanced in knowledge, but living animals are relatively inferior?
Because people can know the logos (essence) of dinosaurs
Physiological structure, evolutionary history
But dinosaurs didn't know why they lived the way they did
where did it evolve from
It is through human rational contemplation
The essence of animals and plants has risen from the natural level to the spiritual level
On the surface, it seems that human reason is thinking about the object
But Aristotle said: They are really the same thing
For when reason thinks about everything
It is to let the essence be realized in the spiritual world
like holding something in front of a mirror
The mirror will show the image of something
when people think
Reason becomes the mirror image of the world
reflect the essence of things
Aristotle called this "active intellect"
If you only receive information from the outside world
That's passive reason
When you think about "what is the essence of something" independently
active reason
Aristotle said: This intellect is "the divinity in humanity"
The God here is not the Christian God
not a creator who made everything
It is the owner of the "illumination" that illuminates all things
Human reason is like light
If there is no light, you can't see the color of everything
until the light
color to be seen
light does not create color
Color has always existed as a potential
the same essence of all things
exist in the world in the form of potential
If humans don't use reason to understand everything
It's like the world lost its light
The essence of all things would not be seen
When people start using active reason
When actively meditating on the nature of the world
Your reason will light up the world
For example when you study biology
Your mind will be raised to a new level
You can use biological knowledge to illuminate the world's creatures at any time
To "clarify" the principles of animal life
So Aristotle's "divinity"
It's a way of life
When human beings meditate and think about the essence
become like a god
This leads to an interesting conclusion
It is human nature to use reason
Explore the nature of all things
But when people constantly use active rationality
He is beyond human nature
From humanity to divinity
This concept is very important in the history of Western philosophy
Western civilization has long believed that humans are superior to animals and plants
It is because human rationality can recognize the logos of animals and plants
But animals and plants don't know themselves rationally
So man is closer to God
The life and legal status of animals and plants are relatively low.
Dehida
will criticize this as logos-centrism
You presuppose that all existence has some kind of logos
can be known rationally
But this presupposition may itself be problematic
After distinguishing between humans and animals and plants
We know that the uniqueness of human beings is that they are rational and can think about the essence
Now Aristotle goes a step further and says:
people more special place
Only people can use reason to discuss "how to live the best life"
Animals can't think about it
Animals are living the lives that nature demands
So only humans have the possibility of happiness
This is the question Aristotle's ethics seeks to answer
How can a person achieve happiness?
First Aristotle observed
Human desires are always changing
When you're poor you crave wealth
But when you have money and want something else
sick people long for health
But when you're healthy you'll crave something else
So we thought what we wanted was a
but when we get a we want b
as if the nature of desire
is that it keeps pointing to the next thing
People think that if they have wealth and health, they will be happy
But when they have these
I found myself not happy again
Most people don't really know what to pursue in life
So now Aristotle says:
We have to distinguish between two kinds of good that human beings pursue
Some things are "instrumental good"
People desire these things because they bring other benefits
like money and power are instrumental good
People pursue wealth because money can be used to buy things
If one day the currency loses its value
That money is not worth chasing
by contrast
Some things have an "intrinsic good"
People desire these things because they are worth pursuing in themselves
it is an end in itself
For example, art is sometimes not for commercial value
but art for art's sake
or humor
You don't ask comedians: Why do you want to be funny?
It's funny for nothing but to be funny
humor itself has intrinsic value
The same happiness belongs to the inner good
When people pursue happiness, it is for the matter itself
not for anything else
happiness itself is the end
Everyone desires a happy life
some may object
So how do you explain those who seek pain?
Like many religions have penance
Catholics will self-flagellate
Aristotle would say:
These people seek pain on the surface
But still longing for happiness
It's just that what they pursue is the happiness of the afterlife
If we all agree that everyone desires happiness
And happiness is not for other purposes
The next question is how to achieve happiness?
aristotle tell you first
What actions fail to achieve human happiness
Many people think that life is all about having fun
Working hard to make money is to enjoy life
According to Aristotle
If your life is the pursuit of coolness
think this is happiness
Then your life will be like a beast
Because sensuality animals also have
If you only use your senses to live
then you're reducing yourself to an animal
They have forgotten that they are human
Don't eat too much fat
will be killed
Animals are driven by their natural desires for pleasure
So if you pursue pleasure every day
You're actually living a life of coercion
Forced by whom?
Forced by your bestial desires
to find happiness
To see the difference between humans and animals
what is that?
man can use his peculiar rationality
To do everything and every action to the best state
All human activities are in pursuit of the ultimate good
be able to do one thing to perfection
or being the most fair person in a situation
to experience happiness
This "excellence is happiness" concept
In fact, it has been recognized by contemporary psychology
Psychologist Csikszentmihalyi found that
When a person is highly focused on doing one thing
will forget me
The brain enters a state of "flow"
people feel greater happiness
But Aristotle emphasized that the excellence of man's virtue
In ancient Greek, excellence and virtue are actually the same word (Arete)
For virtue is the full realization of one's own potentialities,
For example, the virtue of eyes is to see clearly
The virtue of a horse is to run fast
The virtue of man is that in every situation
Do the best, most just, noblest action
And you have to follow it through your life
Let this order seep into your soul
Someone who just gets complacent after doing a good thing or two
not happy
For example, after you exercise for a while, you reach health
feel very happy
This health should not be the end of your exercise
It should be the starting point to keep you moving.
So Aristotle said
"Seeing a swallow is not the same as seeing a spring"
You have to get used to doing the same great actions
until it becomes second nature
become a state of the soul
That is what we modern people call character
This makes Aristotle very different from Plato
Aristotle emphasized:
Virtue is repeated action, not theory
You can get a definition of bravery through philosophical debate
But knowing what bravery doesn't make you brave
Man becomes brave only by acting bravely
Some people talk about what it means to be brave every day
But in times of war, they dare not go to the battlefield
It's like the patient is listening to the doctor's orders very carefully.
But he doesn't do exactly what the doctor told him to do.
The patient's body still won't get better
The same is just listening to others talk about philosophy
won't improve your soul
You have to listen and put it into practice
Use your own actions to transform the soul
Virtue comes from taking action, not listening to lectures
here comes the problem
What if I pursue virtue and do good deeds, but the result is evil?
Isn't that painful? How can it be a happy life?
Aristotle said if you do just deeds
Feeling unhappy because you don't have good rewards
then you can't be a righteous person
because you're still calculating
virtuous action as a means to happiness
you got it wrong
true love of justice
Happy to see justice done
Just like a dog lover feels happy when he sees a dog
The practice of justice itself is the realization of happiness
Rather than feeling happy when something is done and getting a positive reward
So Aristotle's set of ethics
very different from Christian morality
christians think
No matter how much suffering and injustice man suffers in the world
Just live by the rules and try to do good
You will be compensated in the next life, you can go to heaven to enjoy
This was unbelievable to the ancient Greeks
because the ancient greeks believed
After death, the soul wanders in the underworld
Live a wasteful life every day
There is no reward in the afterlife
That's why Aristotle focused on this life
Emphasize that the task of ethics is to reorganize human desires
make you happy when you do good
pain when doing something bad
Don't think about what good will be rewarded and evil will be rewarded afterwards
you might say
But people are tempted to do bad things.
For example, people clearly know that smoking is harmful to health
But for smoking to be satisfied
So I would rather harm my health
Aristotle said:
"All evil deeds come from one man's misallocation of happiness"
to prevent this from happening
One must educate a person from an early age
restrain yourself from doing bad things
You can get real happiness instead
Like the ancient Greeks put a lot of emphasis on physical education
It is through habit formation and repeated training
Let children know how to be brave and strong
love, encouragement
they will do it naturally
That is to use external incentives to organize children's desires
This kind of moral training is irrational
Because when children were young
You can't give them a long list of reasons
Even if you reason with children
they may not understand
Therefore, the development of virtue must be an unconscious habit at the beginning.
Let children subtly absorb the ethical values ​​pursued by the community
After their bodies get used to it
Grow up and then accept philosophy education to explore what is bravery
That's what Socrates was doing
So act virtuously
Although at first it was an unconscious habit
But after people develop self-awareness
you can reflect on your habits
Criticize how these habits are influenced by culture, family
Actively recognize certain good habits
and get rid of some bad habits
This self-criticism is the expression of human freedom
Only critically reflect on one's own living habits
It is possible for man to be free and to be happy
Finally, there is a kind of moral skeptic who will question
What if it's better to do unjust things?
Why must we live an ethical life and become a virtuous person?
Aristotle responded:
I ain't gonna tell people who don't believe me they're wrong
Because ethical life is something you have to experience before you can understand
It's like someone who's never been in love
It's no use explaining to him what love is
This is the difference between Aristotle and Plato
Plato insisted on convincing his doubters
It is good to live a life of justice and courage
is in one's best interest
But it was refuted by Callicles:
"Justice" is just a nonsense that the weak want to use to contain the strong
reality is
The few strong can get more benefits
But if the strong foolishly believe in the justice of philosophers
Instead, they will sell their own interests to the public
Such justice harms the interests of the strong
In the end Plato found that he could not win Callicles
But now Aristotle's answer is even higher
Convince naysayers without arguments
For those who have lived a righteous life
I can feel happiness by myself
I will fall in love with this life
you don't need to convince him at all
So those who are living an ethical life
Living proof in itself
After an introduction to ethics
Aristotle said to pursue happiness
Ethical living is not enough
Because there is still a need for a city-state to provide basic living security
man can achieve happiness
"Not living in a city-state, either a beast or a god"
So now we have to turn to political science
aristotle says
Human nature is a political animal
Humans are not just social animals
and turn himself into a citizen
Use rational deliberation to organize social division of labor
Although other animals live in groups
But just doing social division of labor out of nature
If human nature is a political animal
So why are all the city-states in history so imperfect?
Filled with injustice?
That's paradoxical
you see horses in nature
As long as a healthy horse runs fast
Because nature endows horses with the ability to run fast
So if nature also endows man with the capacity to be a political citizen
How then can every human society be flawed?
As if people aren't really fit to build political communities
man in nature
The only species that creates an unhealthy environment for itself
why?
Aristotle believed:
This is because the "regime" determines the constitution of a society
The difference between people also stems from the difference in political system
Persians live in a dictatorial society
Lack of a culture of democratic debate
Athenians live in a democratic society
Human reason can be used for deliberation
So the government of Athens is better
more human happiness
Persians are just barbarians
But all regimes are subject to corruption
Aristotle saw the collapse of Athenian democracy
This led him to offer a critique of democracy
Democracy is a regime ruled by the majority of the poor, for the benefit of the poor
If the best interests of the city-state are to be taken into account
Rule should be given to good citizens who are virtuous
But in any society
Only a very small number of people are virtuous citizens
Because excellence is only achievable by a few
Therefore, Aristotle favored the system of men of virtue and aristocracy
For building the best city-state
You must first know how to live the best human life
But only a few sages experience this life
Then we should let these few people
build city-states for the common good
But the result of letting a few virtuous men rule
that most people will be excluded from political life
woman, worker merchant, slave
are not eligible to participate in political discussions
because Aristotle said
Women are less rational than men
also lack practical wisdom
Workers and businessmen always put their own private interests ahead of Chengbang's
And slaves are incapable of independent thinking
Always need the master's guidance
plus the ability to do thoughtful deliberation
must have free time
This was a right reserved only for male citizens in ancient Greece
If you give women, laborers, slaves to make decisions
Instead they come up with bad ideas
The opposite of
A Few Virtuous Male Citizens Make the Decisions
will realize the best interests of the people of the country
Aristotle's logic, which excludes certain groups from the start
virtuous man who respects only a few
But we can ask:
Are women, laborers, and slaves really less capable of political thinking?
Couldn't these people offer some perspective on our happy lives?
Really only a few virtuous people can tell us what happiness is,
Should the political system be designed according to their views?
Today we introduce Aristotelian philosophy
Each link is linked together to form a system
man has body and soul
Reason in the soul makes man different from animals
Innate desire to understand the world
Can contemplate the nature of all things with active reason
And when man turns the object of contemplation to himself
You will find that everyone desires to live a happy life
From natural philosophy to ethics
Because only by living an ethical life
To practice nobility, justice, generosity
people will feel true happiness
But to be able to do this
to realize the value you desire
must rely on the support of the social environment
must build a political community
So ethics turns to politics
a good city-state
To be ruled by those who have lived an ethical life
These people can critically reflect on their own habits
How is it shaped by social culture
This contemplative activity is the highest degree of virtue
When people use active reason, they transcend human nature
God-like abilities activated
forms that can illuminate all things
So political science eventually turned to metaphysics
man in contemplative activity
It has become a bridge between the gods and nature
lived the happiest life
