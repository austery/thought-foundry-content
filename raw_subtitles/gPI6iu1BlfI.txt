From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Natalie


Ketrof.
 This
 is
 the
 Daily.


When
 the
 Mexican
 military
 captured
 and


killed
 the
 country's
 top
 drug
 lord,
 it


revealed
 how
 much
 President
 Trump's


growing
 pressure
 is
 forcing
 the
 country


to
 take
 on
 the
 cartels.


Today,
 my
 colleagues
 Maria
 Abihabib
 and


Jack
 Nikas
 on
 the
 operation
 to
 take
 down


that
 drug
 lord,
 El
 Mencho,
 and
 whether


Mexico
 has
 what
 it
 takes
 to
 win
 a
 war
 on


some
 of
 the
 most
 powerful
 criminals
 in


the
 world.


It's
 Thursday,
 February
 26th.


Maria,
 Jack,
 wonderful
 to
 have
 you
 both


on
 the
 show.
 Three
 Mexico
 City
 bureau


chiefs.


>> I'm
 sitting
 in
 your
 old
 office,
 Natalie.


>> Jack,
 current
 Maria
 former,
 Natalie


former.
 We
 all
 were
 in
 Latin
 America
 as


correspondents
 together.
 Maria,
 you
 and


I
 both
 covered
 the
 cartels
 at
 the
 same


time
 and
 did
 some
 intense
 reporting
 on


that,


>> to
 put
 it
 lightly.


So,
 we
 have
 you
 here
 because
 the
 news


that
 Mexico
 had
 taken
 out
 Elmeno,
 the


head
 of
 the
 Halisco
 cartel,
 was
 massive.


And
 we've
 learned
 in
 the
 days
 since
 that


the
 Trump
 administration
 played
 a
 big


part
 in
 that.
 So,
 level
 set
 for
 us.
 Why


is
 the
 takeown
 of
 this
 one
 cartel
 leader


such
 a
 big
 deal?


>> Well,
 Eleno
 was
 arguably
 the
 single


biggest
 criminal
 in
 the
 world.
 He
 was


arguably
 the
 most
 wanted
 man
 in
 the


world.
 He
 led
 the
 biggest
 cartel
 in


Mexico.
 He
 led
 the
 biggest
 cartel


perhaps
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 I
 know
 we
 tend


to
 avoid
 using
 superlatives,
 but
 it's


hard
 to
 overstate
 the
 importance
 and


significance
 of
 this
 figure
 in
 the


criminal
 world.
 And
 it's
 a
 really
 big


deal
 that
 the
 Mexican
 government
 went


after
 him
 because
 he
 had
 been
 on
 the
 run


for
 two
 decades.
 He
 has
 ties
 to


government
 figures
 around
 the
 Mexican


government.
 And
 this
 is
 4
 months
 just


before
 the
 World
 Cup
 arrives,
 just
 a
 few


hours
 from
 where
 he
 was
 found.
 And
 this


is
 a
 major
 move
 that
 could
 open
 a
 new


chapter
 of
 violence
 in
 Mexico.


>> Yeah.
 I
 also
 think
 that
 at
 this
 point,


this
 is
 a
 huge
 test
 for
 the
 Mexican


government.
 They
 have
 never
 been
 tested


like
 this.
 And
 the
 last
 time
 they
 tried


to
 really
 take
 on
 a
 domestic
 threat
 like


this
 was
 about
 15
 years
 ago.
 But
 that


was
 a
 different
 cartel
 which
 was
 not


nearly
 as
 big,
 did
 not
 nearly
 have
 the


geographical
 reach
 or
 the
 penant
 for


brutality
 that
 Halisco
 cartel
 has.
 So


we're
 going
 to
 be
 seeing
 Mexico
 security


forces
 tested
 in
 a
 way
 that
 we've
 never


seen
 before.
 So
 let's
 see
 what
 happens.


>> Okay,
 let's
 talk
 about
 Eleno,
 this


cartel
 leader.
 I
 think
 for
 a
 lot
 of


listeners,
 he
 wasn't
 a
 household
 name.


So
 lay
 out
 for
 me
 how
 Elmentoo
 got
 to
 be


the
 most
 wanted
 man
 in
 the
 world.


Well,
 he
 was
 born
 into
 poverty
 in
 the


state
 of
 Mitwakan,
 which
 is
 in
 the
 west.


He
 has
 five
 brothers.
 He
 grew
 up
 kind
 of


growing
 avocados,
 which
 is
 one
 of
 the


livelihoods
 of
 Mituakan.
 A
 lot
 of
 the


avocados
 that
 Americans
 make
 guacamole


from,
 come
 from
 that
 state.
 He
 dropped


out
 of
 primary
 school,
 I
 think
 about


fifth
 grade,
 to
 work
 in
 the
 fields.
 And


then
 by
 the
 time
 he
 was
 a
 teenager,
 he


started
 to
 guard
 marijuana
 plantations


apparently.


>> And
 then
 he
 decided
 that
 he
 wanted
 to


immigrate
 to
 California.
 So
 he
 did
 so
 in


the
 1980s.
 Apparently
 he
 said
 he
 wanted


a
 better
 life.
 So
 he
 moves
 up
 to
 San


Francisco,
 the
 Bay
 Area,
 and
 he
 ends
 up


falling
 back
 into
 crime,
 and
 he
 gets


arrested
 by
 the
 police
 up
 there.
 He's


about
 20
 at
 this
 point,
 and
 he
 ends
 up


getting
 deported.
 But
 like
 the
 soant


that
 he
 is,
 he
 decides
 that
 he's
 going


to
 start
 changing
 names
 and
 he
 starts


criss-crossing
 the
 US
 Mexico
 border.


Every
 time
 he's
 arrested,
 he
 gets
 thrown


back
 into
 Mexico.
 He
 comes
 back.
 By


1992,
 he's
 arrested
 one
 last
 time
 at


this
 point
 in
 Sacramento,
 California.


And
 he's
 arrested
 because
 he
 and
 his


brother
 are
 carrying
 out
 a
 heroin
 deal.


And
 he
 spends
 3
 years
 in
 prison.
 And
 so


at
 this
 point,
 he's
 deported
 again
 to


Mexico
 and
 he's
 in
 his
 30s.
 And
 he
 joins


the
 local
 police.


>> Wow.


>> Yes.


>> Former
 drug
 dealer
 becomes
 a
 police


officer.
 Kind
 of
 a
 wild
 career
 switch.


You
 know,
 it
 happens
 more
 than
 you
 would


think
 in
 Mexico
 because
 we
 have
 to


remember
 that
 Mexico
 has
 corruption


problems
 specifically
 within
 the
 police.


>> Okay,
 so
 he
 becomes
 a
 police
 officer
 in


a
 police
 force
 that
 is
 notoriously


corrupt.
 What
 happens?


>> Well,
 so
 he
 kind
 of
 realizes
 that,
 well,


everybody
 else
 is
 on
 the
 take
 and
 I'd
 be


a
 sucker
 not
 to
 be
 on
 the
 take.


So
 he
 switches
 over
 and
 he
 joins
 the


Millennial
 Cartel
 which
 at
 this
 point
 is


very
 very
 strong
 in
 the
 country


southwest.
 And
 strategically
 he
 realizes


the
 way
 to
 really
 rise
 up
 the
 ranks
 of


this
 cartel
 is
 to
 marry
 one
 of
 the


leader
 daughters.


>> So
 it's
 a
 Romeo
 and
 Juliet
 story
 but


filled
 with
 heroin
 and
 meth
 and


everything
 in
 between.


>> Sure.
 A
 classic.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 he
 rises
 through
 the
 ranks


and
 then
 in
 2008
 and
 2009,
 government


security
 forces
 end
 up
 arresting
 or


killing
 a
 bunch
 of
 leaders
 from
 the


Millennial
 Cartel.


>> This
 is
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 last
 time


the
 Mexican
 government
 did
 a
 really


serious
 push
 to
 dismantle
 the
 cartels,
 a


war
 on
 these
 cartels.


>> Exactly.
 And
 it
 sets
 off
 this
 extremely


bloody,
 brutal
 leadership
 fight
 for
 who


becomes
 the
 head
 honcho
 of
 Millennial


Cartel.
 And
 through
 sheer
 brute
 force


and
 his
 ability
 to
 really
 embrace
 some


of
 the
 most
 disgusting,
 gruesome,
 brutal


acts,
 who
 rises
 and
 ends
 up
 being
 on


top?
 Well,
 it's
 Elmento.


and
 he
 spins
 off
 his
 forces
 to
 form
 an


independent
 cartel,
 which
 is
 the
 Kalisco


New
 Generation
 Cartel.
 Emphasis
 on


generation
 because
 this
 is
 a
 long-term


project.
 He's
 in
 it
 for
 the
 long
 haul.


>> And
 what
 is
 the
 defining
 feature
 of
 this


new
 group
 he's
 leading,
 the
 Halisco


cartel?
 It's
 his
 ability
 to
 or
 want
 and


desire
 to
 really
 just


be
 as
 brutal
 as
 absolutely
 possible.
 So


for
 instance,
 there
 were
 reports
 that


his
 new
 recruits,
 he
 really
 needed
 these


people
 to
 show
 that
 they
 would
 be
 as


compliant
 as
 foot
 soldiers
 as
 they


possibly
 could
 be
 and
 that
 they
 were


also
 willing
 to
 implement
 the
 levels
 of


violence
 that
 he
 himself
 favored.
 So
 for


instance,
 there
 were
 reports
 of


cannibalism.
 you're
 a
 recruit
 and
 guess


what?
 You've
 got
 to
 eat
 somebody.


Somebody
 who
 had
 betrayed
 the
 cartel.


>> So,
 Eleno
 becomes
 a
 kind
 of
 pioneer
 in


this
 much
 more
 aggressive,
 violent
 way


of
 doing
 business.
 And
 when
 I
 was
 in


Mexico,
 it
 was
 also
 clear
 that
 part
 of


his
 signature
 was
 also
 diversifying
 the


purpose
 of
 that
 violence,
 right?
 He


pursued
 a
 broad
 range
 of
 business


opportunities
 that
 went
 beyond
 just


drugs.


Oh,
 for
 sure.
 He
 wants
 the
 Khalisco


cartel
 to
 have
 a
 finger
 in
 every
 pie.


So,
 avocados,
 obviously,
 something
 he


knows
 very
 well
 from
 his
 days
 picking


them
 when
 he
 was
 a
 kid.
 Guess
 what?
 If


you're
 an
 avocado
 grower,
 you
 have
 to


either
 pick
 avocados
 for
 his
 cartel
 or


you
 have
 to
 um
 give
 a
 piece
 of
 whatever


you
 harvest
 that
 year
 to
 him.
 And
 then


he
 expands
 his
 empire
 and
 it
 becomes


more
 of
 like
 a
 conglomerate.
 He's
 not


just
 doing
 drugs.
 He's
 in
 the
 hotel


industry.
 They
 start
 bilking,
 you
 know,


senior
 citizens
 from
 the
 United
 States


to
 Canada
 from
 their
 time
 shares.
 And


also,
 they're
 now
 involved
 in
 illegal


gold
 mining
 throughout
 South
 America,


which
 is
 laying
 ravage
 to
 rainforests


across
 that
 continent.


>> I
 think
 one
 visual
 way
 to
 see
 the


different
 approach
 of
 the
 Halisco
 cartel


is
 the
 map
 of
 Mexico,
 particularly
 when


it's
 overlaid
 with
 the
 different
 cartels


control.
 And
 what
 you
 see
 is
 the
 Halisco


cartel
 really
 has
 presence
 across
 the


country
 and
 it
 really
 has
 conquered


almost
 every
 state
 it
 it
 has
 presence
 in


and
 there
 is
 widespread
 corruption


within
 the
 states
 and
 local
 governments


across
 their
 region
 to
 make
 sure
 that


Halisco
 can
 do
 what
 it
 wants
 without
 any


questions.


>> Just
 talk
 about
 that
 the
 extent
 of
 the


corruption
 and
 what
 this
 group
 can
 do.


It
 becomes
 incredibly
 powerful
 right
 and


rich.
 So
 that
 gives
 them
 resources
 to
 do


this
 kind
 of
 work.


>> It
 gives
 them
 resources.
 It's
 natural


for
 us
 to
 make
 the
 analogy
 that
 these


guys
 are
 a
 Fortune
 500
 company
 with
 a


diverse
 set
 of
 businesses.
 No
 question.


They
 are
 also
 in
 a
 way
 a
 state
 actor.


They
 have
 their
 tentacles
 in
 the
 state


governments
 and
 in
 the
 local
 governments


across
 the
 country.
 And
 that
 allows
 them


to
 really
 operate
 unbridled.
 And
 it
 even


means
 that
 when
 a
 hurricane
 hits,


sometimes
 the
 Halisco
 cartel
 are
 the


ones
 providing
 aid
 uh
 because
 they
 want


to
 generate,
 you
 know,
 some
 goodwill


with
 constituents.
 So
 I
 think
 it's


really
 difficult
 to
 understand
 the


importance
 of
 the
 cartels
 to
 the
 economy


but
 also
 to
 the
 society.
 They
 are
 a
 fact


of
 daily
 life
 in
 Mexico.


>> Okay.
 Given
 what
 you've
 both
 laid
 out


about
 the
 steady
 and
 menacing
 rise
 of


this
 group
 and
 their
 power
 across


Mexico,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


going
 to
 be
 wondering
 at
 this
 point,


what
 was
 the
 government
 doing
 this
 whole


time
 that
 this
 was
 happening?
 Were
 they


going
 after
 the
 Halisco
 cartel
 in
 Eleno?


What
 was
 their
 response?


>> Well,
 a
 lot
 of
 Mexicans
 are
 wondering


that
 as
 well.
 This
 certainly
 was
 a
 a


rise
 that
 wasn't
 just,
 you
 know,
 a


single
 year.
 This
 is
 something
 that


played
 out
 over
 15
 or
 more
 years.
 The


reality
 is
 Elmen
 was
 very
 elusive.
 He


basically,
 you
 know,
 according
 to
 a


senior
 government
 official
 I
 just
 spoke


to,
 he
 really
 basically
 just
 used
 human


messengers.
 He
 was
 not
 on
 the
 phone.
 He


did
 not
 use
 radio.
 He
 was
 extremely


disciplined
 and
 as
 a
 result
 that
 allowed


him
 to
 elude
 capture
 for
 so
 long.
 Um,


but
 it
 wasn't
 like
 they
 didn't
 almost


catch
 him
 a
 few
 times.
 So
 in
 2012,
 they


did
 go
 after
 him,
 but
 his
 followers,
 you


know,
 his
 his
 gunman
 basically
 robbed
 a


bunch
 of
 cars
 and
 they
 set
 them
 on
 fire


and
 set
 up
 these
 roadblocks
 across
 the


city,
 and
 that
 allowed
 Elena
 to
 escape.


In
 2015,
 they
 also
 nearly
 caught
 Elmeno,


but
 his
 gunmen
 literally
 shot
 down
 a


Mexican
 military
 helicopter,
 killing


three
 soldiers,
 and
 he
 got
 away
 then
 as


well.
 But
 over
 the
 past
 decade,
 there


really
 haven't
 been
 many
 close
 calls.


And
 I
 think
 that
 raises
 the
 question
 of


why
 not.
 I
 think
 that
 is
 in
 part
 because


of
 incompetence
 by
 the
 Mexican


authorities,
 but
 it
 is
 also
 in
 part


because
 of
 complicity.
 As
 we
 noted,
 this


cartel
 had
 tentacles
 in
 governments


across
 the
 nation.
 And
 that
 complicates


that
 effort
 when
 you've
 got
 policemen


and
 politicians
 tipping
 them
 off.


>> Yeah.
 And
 it
 also
 should
 be
 said
 that
 a


lot
 of
 these
 attempts
 to
 kill
 Element


were
 with
 the
 United
 States.
 Killer


capture
 really.
 And
 you
 know,
 several


American
 law
 enforcement
 had
 said
 to
 to


me
 and
 others
 and
 on
 our
 team
 that
 a
 it


was
 very
 difficult
 to
 catch
 him
 because


he
 was
 just
 that
 good.
 And
 then
 b
 there


was
 also
 this
 complicity
 with
 the
 uh


Mexican
 government
 to
 an
 extent
 where


sometimes
 they
 were
 just
 tipped
 off
 and


he
 was
 able
 to
 scurry
 away.
 So,
 it's


both
 difficult
 for
 the
 Mexican


government
 to
 fend
 off
 the
 pull
 of
 this


multi-billion
 dollar
 corporation,
 which


is
 the
 Halisco
 cartel,
 and
 at
 the
 same


time,
 there's
 been
 a
 hesitance
 or


reluctance
 to
 go
 at
 them
 headon
 because


it
 means
 going
 up
 against
 a
 whole
 system


that
 perpetuates
 their
 power,


>> right?
 Right.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


precisely
 why
 the
 cartels
 have
 become


such
 an
 intractable
 problem
 for
 Mexico.


>> And
 it's
 what
 makes
 it
 even
 more


shocking
 that
 the
 Mexican
 government
 was


able
 to
 go
 up
 against
 Elno
 this
 time
 and


actually
 get
 him.
 So
 Jack,
 walk
 me


through
 how
 that
 operation
 went
 down.


So,
 what
 we
 know
 is
 that
 on
 Sunday


morning,
 Mexican
 special
 forces
 and
 the


Mexican
 army
 raided
 a
 rental
 home
 in
 a


wooded
 picturesque
 ranch
 town
 about
 2


hours
 south
 of
 Guadalajara
 uh
 in
 Halisco


and
 they
 were
 backed
 by
 six
 military


helicopters
 and
 they
 got
 into
 a
 very


intense
 firefight
 uh
 with
 El
 Mencho
 and


his
 men.
 Mencho
 slipped
 out
 the
 back
 and


tried
 to
 escape
 with
 at least
 two


bodyguards.
 Eventually,
 Mexican
 forces


then
 found
 him
 hiding
 in
 the
 brush.
 They


continued
 to
 engage
 in
 crossfire
 with


Mencho
 and
 his
 bodyguards.
 They
 shot


Mencho
 and
 his
 bodyguards.
 Uh
 they
 were


mortally
 wounded.
 They
 then
 put
 Elmeno


and
 his
 two
 other
 bodyguards
 on
 a


helicopter
 for
 air
 transport
 to
 a


hospital
 and
 on
 the
 way
 we
 are
 told
 they


died.
 And
 that
 was
 it.
 It
 was
 certainly


bloody.
 It
 was
 certainly
 violent.
 But


government
 officials
 actually
 told
 me


that
 it
 was
 better
 than
 they
 expected.


>> And
 Jack,
 what
 do
 we
 know
 about
 the


intelligence
 that
 led
 the
 operation
 to


be
 successful
 in
 this
 case?


>> Well,
 as
 we
 noted,
 Elena
 was
 an


incredibly
 elusive
 figure
 because
 he
 was


incredibly
 disciplined,
 right?


>> However,
 it
 appears
 that
 he
 got
 a
 little


sloppy.
 M


>> uh
 the
 Mexican
 government
 says
 that
 they


identified
 a
 quote
 unquote
 close


associate
 of
 a
 woman
 uh
 who
 was
 one
 of


Eleno's
 lovers.
 And
 they
 watched
 this


man
 drop
 uh
 this
 woman
 off
 at
 the
 home


where
 Elmento
 was
 staying.
 And
 at
 that


point,
 they
 were
 somehow
 able
 to
 confirm


that
 Elmeno
 was
 home.


>> Amazing.
 They
 got
 him
 by
 following
 his


girlfriend.


>> Yes,
 it
 came
 down
 to
 his
 lover.
 But
 it


also
 appears
 that
 there
 was
 important


information
 coming
 from
 the
 CIA.
 There


was
 no
 American
 boots
 on
 the
 ground.


This
 was
 a
 Mexican
 law
 enforcement


operation,
 but
 some
 of
 the
 intelligence


that
 fed
 it
 came
 from
 the
 United
 States.


Got
 it.
 And
 once
 Eleno's
 death
 is


confirmed,
 we
 saw
 the
 country
 erupt
 in


flames
 as
 the
 cartel
 is
 responding
 on


the
 streets.
 cartel
 members
 loyal
 to


Eleno,
 we
 understand,
 were
 lighting


things
 on
 fire,
 blocking
 roads.
 We
 heard


of
 American
 tourists
 kind
 of
 sheltering


in
 place
 in
 their
 hotels.
 Just
 describe


what
 we
 were
 seeing
 in
 Mexico.


>> This
 was
 uh
 really
 a
 day
 of
 mayhem.


>> Massive
 plumes
 of
 smoke
 darken
 the
 skies


of
 seaside
 resort
 towns
 and
 tourist


hotspots,
 but
 locals
 are
 the
 most


threatened.
 And
 it
 was
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 shows
 of
 force
 and
 violence
 by
 a


cartel
 in
 recent
 Mexican
 history.
 We


were
 actually
 terrified
 and
 we
 saw
 the


people
 running
 down
 the
 streets
 running


from
 the
 flames
 and
 stuff
 and
 the
 fire


and


>> and
 it
 actually
 showed
 the
 breadth
 of


the
 organization
 that
 Elmeno
 had
 built


because
 it
 wasn't
 just
 in
 Halisco
 but
 it


was
 from
 coast
 to
 coast
 in
 at
 least
 20


states
 across
 the
 nation.
 There
 was,
 you


know,
 cars
 on
 fire,
 blocked
 roads,
 banks


on
 fire,
 supermarkets
 on
 fire,


and
 also
 shootings.
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 there


was
 at least
 25
 members
 of
 the
 National


Guard
 who
 were
 killed
 uh
 as
 part
 of
 some


of
 this
 mayhem
 on
 Sunday.
 And
 that
 was,


I
 think,
 an
 explosion
 of
 of
 rage
 and


also
 power
 from
 this
 Halisco
 cartel.
 But


it
 also
 was
 a
 short
 burst
 of
 violence.


uh
 you
 know
 after
 Sunday
 things
 really


have
 calmed
 down
 and
 you
 know
 by
 midweek


the
 Mexican
 government
 says
 you
 know
 all


roads
 are
 clear
 all
 the
 fires
 are
 put


out
 and
 um
 and
 there
 really
 are
 no


shelter
 in
 place
 orders
 uh
 to
 speak
 of


and
 so
 Mexico
 is
 kind
 of
 back
 to
 normal


>> right
 and
 now
 the
 question
 seems
 to
 be


what
 happens
 next
 does
 the
 government


decide
 to
 keep
 pushing
 on
 an
 offensive


against
 the
 Halisco
 cartel
 given
 the


stakes
 and
 the
 pressure
 the
 government


is
 under
 from
 the
 United
 States,
 from


the
 Trump
 administration.


>> That's
 exactly
 the
 question
 because


while
 things
 are
 back
 to
 normal,
 the


country
 is
 still
 very
 much
 on
 edge


because
 Trump
 is
 still
 pressuring
 the


Mexican
 government
 to
 do
 more
 and
 you


just
 suddenly
 have
 a
 beheaded
 cartel


that
 may
 now
 be
 fighting
 for
 territory


and
 power.


>> We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Marie
 and
 Jack,
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 questions
 hanging
 over
 all
 this


is
 just
 given
 how
 long
 this
 cartel's


power
 has
 been
 steadily
 expanding
 and


how
 well
 known
 the
 problem
 of
 it
 has


been,


why
 did
 the
 Mexican
 government
 do
 this


at
 this
 moment?
 Why
 now?


>> For
 one,
 the
 Mexican
 authorities
 had
 a


piece
 of
 very
 actionable
 intelligence


and
 so
 an
 opportunity
 was
 created
 and


they
 took
 advantage
 of
 it.
 But
 this
 also


comes
 amid
 the
 backdrop
 of
 a
 very


aggressive
 offensive
 against
 the
 cartels


by
 President
 Shane
 Bomb.
 She
 basically


has
 made
 clear
 that
 she
 wants
 to
 take
 a


very
 different
 tact
 from
 her
 predecessor


to
 go
 after
 the
 cartels.
 And
 then
 there


also
 is
 one
 other
 major
 difference
 and


that
 is
 Donald
 J.
 Trump.
 What
 we
 have
 in


Mexico
 right
 now
 is
 a
 sustained
 pressure


campaign
 from
 the
 White
 House
 to
 do
 more


against
 the
 cartels.
 He
 does
 not
 want


any
 more
 of
 the
 same
 excuses.
 He
 is


saying
 the
 Mexican
 government
 must
 solve


its
 cartel
 problems
 or
 the
 US
 military


will
 do
 it.
 And
 that
 has
 meant
 repeated


and
 public
 threats
 of
 a
 unilateral
 US


military
 strike
 against
 the
 cartels


which
 President
 Shane
 Bomb
 has
 said
 is
 a


red
 line
 that
 cannot
 be
 crossed.
 And
 so


instead
 what
 we're
 seeing
 is
 the
 Mexican


government
 doing
 everything
 it
 can
 to


show
 it
 can
 handle
 the
 problem
 itself.


>> Right.
 And
 just
 say
 how
 the
 threat
 of


the
 US
 military
 coming
 in
 and
 doing
 a


strike
 in
 Mexico
 is
 perceived
 in
 the


country
 and
 by
 the
 government


specifically.


Well,
 you
 have
 to
 remember
 that


California
 used
 to
 be
 Mexico.
 The


history
 between
 these
 two
 countries
 is


not
 always
 been
 so
 rosy.
 And
 so
 there
 is


not
 a
 lot
 of
 eagerness
 for
 the
 US


military
 to
 come
 in
 with
 hellfire


missiles
 and
 basically
 try
 to
 attack
 the


cartels
 that
 way
 because
 a
 there's


concerns
 about
 sovereignty
 and
 b
 there's


concerns
 about
 collateral
 damage
 and
 the


number
 of
 civilians
 that
 can
 be
 killed.


So
 therefore,
 there
 is
 a
 real
 unease


with
 what
 Trump
 is
 threatening.
 And


there
 also
 is
 a
 real
 commitment
 by
 the


Mexican
 government
 now
 to
 try
 to
 show


that
 it
 can
 handle
 the
 problem
 itself.


And
 it
 should
 be
 said,
 this
 isn't
 just


an
 idol
 threat
 that
 Trump
 is
 making
 at


this
 point,
 right?
 This
 is
 a
 president


who
 has
 literally
 just
 gone
 into


Venezuela
 and
 ousted
 the
 president
 by


force
 with
 a
 military
 operation.
 So,
 it


feels
 like
 what
 the
 Mexican
 government


is
 dealing
 with
 at
 this
 point
 isn't
 just


rhetoric.
 It's
 actually
 a
 real


possibility.
 Oh,
 yes.
 Apparently,
 from


somebody
 I
 speak
 to
 who's
 in
 touch
 with


her
 inner
 circle,
 it's
 what
 keeps


President
 Shamb
 up
 at
 night.
 Like,
 she


knows
 that
 this
 could
 very
 well
 be
 the


end
 of
 her
 popular
 support.
 And
 her


party,
 the
 Morenna
 party,
 is
 filled
 with


sharks.
 And
 so
 if
 there
 is
 some
 sort
 of


US
 unilateral
 action
 that
 could
 very


well
 spell
 the
 end
 of
 her
 power
 within


that
 party.


>> So
 we
 have
 this
 picture
 of
 a
 Mexican


president
 Claudia
 Shambam
 who's
 under


immense
 pressure
 to
 take
 action.
 But
 at


the
 same
 time,
 she
 is
 someone
 who,
 as


you've
 said,
 has
 already
 seemed
 to
 be


more
 willing
 to
 confront
 the
 cartels


than
 other
 Mexican
 leaders.
 And
 so
 I


wonder
 whether
 it's
 possible
 that
 the


pressure
 from
 Trump
 actually
 may
 in
 a


sense
 be
 giving
 her
 political
 cover
 to


do
 what
 she
 may
 want
 to
 do
 anyway.
 like


maybe
 she
 would
 have
 faced
 some


resistance
 from
 all
 these
 politicians


who
 are
 in
 bed
 with
 the
 cartels.
 Now
 she


can
 point
 to
 Trump
 and
 say,
 "Look,
 I


have
 no
 choice."
 That
 is
 exactly
 the


theory
 we're
 hearing
 from
 uh
 a
 lot
 of


folks
 across
 Mexico
 who
 who
 study
 this


that
 basically
 Shane
 Bomb
 wanted
 to
 go


after
 the
 cartels.
 But
 going
 after
 the


cartels
 in
 Mexico
 with
 the
 political


structure
 that
 exists,
 with
 the


corruption
 that
 exists
 within
 the


Mexican
 government
 from
 the
 federal
 to


the
 local
 level
 is
 very
 difficult.
 But


when
 you
 have
 the
 president
 of
 the


United
 States
 saying,
 "You
 better
 do


this
 or
 we
 will
 invade,"
 that
 changes


the
 calculus.
 She
 can
 go
 back
 to
 her


political
 party
 and
 say,
 "I
 don't
 have


any
 choice.
 I'm
 going
 after


>> Elmeno."


>> So
 officials
 aren't
 saying
 outright
 that


this
 is
 giving
 them
 political
 cover.


Even
 off
 the
 record,
 they
 are
 saying


that
 they're
 doing
 this
 because
 it's


good
 for
 Mexico.
 But,
 you
 know,
 when


those
 conversations
 do
 go
 deeper
 and


when
 you
 speak
 to
 more
 people,
 there
 is


really
 an
 acknowledgment
 that
 the
 Trump


effect
 is
 real.
 Jack,
 you
 said
 that
 the


violence
 in
 response
 to
 Elro's
 killing


died
 down
 quite
 quickly.
 And
 I
 want
 to


ask
 about
 that
 because
 that
 was
 actually


one
 of
 the
 most
 surprising
 things
 to
 me,


that
 the
 violent
 response
 from
 the


cartel
 didn't
 last
 longer.
 And
 I
 wonder


if
 you
 think
 it's
 possible
 that
 the


cartel
 moderated
 their
 response
 to
 their


leader's
 death
 because
 they
 worried
 that


making
 the
 country
 look
 too
 out
 of


control
 might
 give
 Donald
 Trump
 an


excuse
 to
 intervene
 which
 would
 be


devastating
 for
 them.


>> Yes.
 So,
 it
 was
 surprising
 that
 the


violence
 died
 down
 that
 quickly
 in
 large


part
 because
 we
 haven't
 seen
 it
 die
 down


like
 that
 in
 other
 instances
 of
 the
 top


leaders
 getting
 captured
 or
 killed.
 And


so,
 I
 think
 your
 theory
 is
 certainly
 a


valid
 one
 because
 we
 have
 already
 made


clear
 here
 that
 President
 Shane
 Bomb
 is


worried
 about
 a
 strike
 from
 Donald


Trump.
 Let's
 be
 clear,
 the
 narcos
 are


also
 worried.
 Hm.


>> You
 know,
 our
 colleague
 Paulina
 Viegas


and
 I
 just
 got
 back
 from
 Sinoa
 where
 we


met
 with
 multiple
 narcos
 and
 they
 were


very
 worried
 and
 it
 also
 they
 gave
 the


same
 reason
 that
 the
 government


officials
 are
 giving
 which
 is
 the


capture
 of
 Maduro
 changed
 the
 game
 for


us.
 They
 now
 are
 worried
 themselves
 that


they
 may
 be
 on
 the
 receiving
 end
 of
 a


hellfire
 missile.
 And
 so
 that
 has
 to
 be


changing
 the
 calculus
 of
 the
 criminal


organizations
 in
 Mexico
 about
 how
 they


go
 about
 their
 business,
 how
 they
 carry


out
 revenge
 like
 this,
 and
 how
 they
 make


a
 scene.
 Because
 in
 some
 ways,
 they're


trying
 to
 run
 a
 business.
 When
 you're


trying
 to
 run
 a
 business,
 you
 kind
 of


need
 to
 keep
 your
 head
 down
 and
 sell


your
 drugs.


>> Given
 that,
 let's
 talk
 about
 what
 this


capture
 means
 for
 the
 cartel
 that
 Eleno


ran
 moving
 forward.
 What's
 the
 upshot


for
 this
 multi-billion
 dollar


organization?
 How
 big
 of
 a
 blow
 is
 this


for
 them?


>> Well,
 it
 depends
 on
 whether
 or
 not
 the


commanders
 who
 were
 under
 Almeno
 can


agree
 amongst
 themselves
 a
 clear
 clean


path
 to
 succession.
 Often
 times
 the


cleanest
 form
 of
 succession
 is
 within


the
 family,
 but
 Meno
 didn't
 have
 a
 lot


of
 of
 kin
 who
 could
 take
 over.
 He
 has


four
 to
 five
 commanders
 who
 could
 be
 his


successors.
 If
 they're
 smart,
 they'll
 go


ahead
 and
 name
 a
 successor
 and
 agree,


but
 we
 rarely
 see
 that
 happen
 when
 the


head
 of
 a
 cartel
 is
 killed.
 So,
 if
 the


cartel
 cannibalizes
 itself
 from
 within


because
 of
 this
 internal
 leadership,


then
 we
 could
 see
 it
 fracture.
 And
 when


it
 fractures,
 that
 creates
 many
 wars
 all


over
 Mexico,


>> right?
 That
 battle
 over
 succession
 could


play
 out
 across
 the
 country
 for
 months,


if
 not
 years.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 question


now
 is
 how
 far
 is
 the
 Mexican
 government


willing
 to
 take
 a
 war
 on
 the
 cartels?


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 that,
 you
 know,


American
 diplomats
 who
 have
 worked
 here


will
 say
 when
 the
 Mexican
 government


wants
 to
 go
 after
 these
 cartels
 and


other
 criminal
 organizations,
 they
 can


do
 it.
 They
 are
 capable.
 They
 know
 how


to
 do
 it.
 So,
 Mexicans
 are
 waiting
 to


see
 is
 this
 going
 to
 be
 a
 more
 sustained


battle
 to
 dislodge
 the
 cartels
 from
 all


these
 different
 corners
 of
 Mexico
 and


reassert
 government
 authority
 here
 or


not.
 But
 it
 is
 a
 day-to-day
 battle.
 It


is
 not
 a
 one-year
 project.
 It
 is
 a


10-year
 project,
 maybe
 more.
 I
 want
 to


talk
 about
 that
 10-year
 project,
 about


what
 it
 would
 actually
 take
 to
 dismantle


these
 groups
 because
 you've
 both
 said


Elno,
 for
 example,
 has
 plenty
 of
 people


waiting
 in
 the
 wings
 to
 succeed
 him.
 I


mean,
 we
 have
 seen,
 history
 shows
 that


taking
 out
 the
 boss
 of
 a
 cartel
 does
 not


automatically
 eliminate
 the
 entire


organization
 underneath
 him.
 When
 I
 was


in
 Sinoa,
 I
 talked
 to
 cartel
 leaders
 who


said,
 "If
 you
 take
 me
 out,
 there's
 10


more
 guys
 waiting
 to
 take
 my
 place."
 So,


what
 is
 the
 recipe
 for
 long-term
 success


here
 for
 actually,
 as
 you
 said,
 Maria,


dislodging
 these
 groups
 from
 the


country?


>> I
 think
 that
 what
 we
 haven't
 seen
 from


the
 Mexican
 government
 is
 addressing
 the


corruption.
 The
 reality
 is
 the
 only
 way


for
 this
 criminal
 group
 to
 get
 this


powerful
 and
 this
 big
 is
 through
 the


complicity
 of
 officials
 across
 the


nation.
 And
 we
 haven't
 seen
 that
 level


of
 political
 will
 yet
 from
 President


Shane
 Bomb
 and
 her
 party
 to
 go
 after
 the


officials
 who
 really
 actually
 have


already
 been
 pointed
 to
 as
 being


corrupt.
 I
 mean,
 one
 of
 the
 most


powerful
 senators
 in
 Mexico
 has
 been


directly
 linked
 to
 a
 cartel.
 The
 former


head
 of
 the
 Navy
 has
 been
 linked
 to
 a


massive
 corruption
 scheme.
 And
 you
 can


go
 down
 the
 list.
 There
 are
 many
 other


politicians.
 And
 this
 is
 actually
 what


we
 hear
 the
 US
 officials
 really
 asking


for
 is
 that
 is
 when
 they
 will
 feel
 there


is
 a
 sign
 of
 real
 progress
 is
 when
 the


Mexican
 government
 starts
 to
 go
 after


the
 corrupt
 politicians
 that
 have


enabled
 this
 to
 go
 on
 this
 long.
 Given


that
 this
 is
 such
 an
 intractable


problem,
 I'm
 just
 curious
 if
 we
 know
 at


what
 point
 President
 Trump
 is
 going
 to


be
 satisfied
 with
 the
 progress
 that


Mexico
 is
 making.
 Like,
 do
 we
 know
 if


this
 move
 to
 take
 out
 Elno
 might
 have


appeased
 Trump
 and
 bought
 the
 Mexican


government
 some
 time?


>> I
 think
 Trump's
 goalposts
 are
 infinite.


And
 the
 strongest
 evidence
 of
 that
 is


that
 less
 than
 24
 hours
 after
 the


Mexican
 government
 killed
 Elmeno,


probably
 the
 single
 biggest
 achievement


that
 the
 government
 has
 had
 in
 the


cartel
 war
 in
 years.
 Trump
 posted


online,
 quote,
 "Mexico
 must
 step
 up


their
 efforts
 on
 cartel
 and
 drugs."


And
 that
 is,
 I
 think,
 a
 clear
 sign
 that


the
 demands
 aren't
 going
 to
 end.
 And


probably
 that's
 the
 point.
 And
 possibly


that's
 also
 what
 is
 necessary
 because


there
 are
 signs
 that
 Trump's
 pressure
 is


creating
 a
 dynamic
 in
 Mexico
 that
 really


hasn't
 existed
 before
 and
 perhaps
 is


creating
 the
 environment
 that
 is


necessary
 to
 finally
 defeat
 or
 at
 least


really
 confront
 these
 massive
 powerful


criminal
 organizations
 in
 a
 way
 that
 the


government
 hasn't.
 And
 I
 think
 that


there
 are
 Mexicans
 who
 while
 they
 don't


want
 a
 unilateral
 strike
 from
 the
 US


government,
 do
 welcome
 Trump's
 attention


to
 this
 matter
 and
 pressure
 on
 this


issue.


>> You're
 saying
 the
 goalpost
 moving
 that


could
 be
 seen
 as
 a
 good
 thing.
 Like
 in


one
 way
 it's
 a
 bait
 and
 switch,
 but
 in


another
 that's
 kind
 of
 just
 how
 progress


works.


>> Well,
 it
 could
 be
 a
 good
 thing,
 but
 I


think
 it
 depends
 on
 how
 far
 it
 goes.


If
 Trump
 is
 just
 putting
 consistent


pressure
 on
 and
 that
 is
 enabling
 and


forcing
 the
 Mexican
 government
 to
 do


what
 it
 needs
 to
 do
 to
 take
 control
 of


the
 cartels,
 I
 think
 many
 Mexicans
 agree


that
 is
 a
 great
 thing.
 However,
 if
 Trump


ultimately
 says,
 "You
 didn't
 do
 what
 I


want
 and
 now
 I'm
 going
 to
 bomb
 you."


Well,
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 whole
 another


story
 because
 that
 is
 going
 to


destabilize
 the
 government,
 inflame
 the


situation,
 and
 really
 throw
 us
 into
 the


unknown.


Well,
 Jack,
 Maria,
 thank
 you
 both
 so


much.


>> Thank
 you,
 Natalie.
 We
 miss
 you
 here
 in


Mexico.


>> Thanks
 so
 much
 for
 having
 us.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's


what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.
 The


files
 released
 by
 the
 Justice
 Department


from
 its
 investigations
 into
 Jeffrey


Epstein
 did
 not
 include
 key
 materials


related
 to
 a
 woman
 who
 made
 an


accusation
 against
 President
 Trump.


According
 to
 a
 review
 by
 the
 New
 York


Times,
 those
 missing
 materials
 are
 FBI


memos
 summarizing
 the
 interviews
 that


the
 bureau
 did
 in
 connection
 with
 claims


made
 in
 2019
 by
 the
 woman
 who
 said
 she'd


been
 sexually
 assaulted
 by
 Trump
 and


Epstein
 decades
 earlier
 when
 she
 was
 a


minor.
 An
 index
 that
 was
 publicly


released
 indicates
 that
 the
 FBI
 did
 four


interviews
 related
 to
 her
 claims
 and


wrote
 summaries
 about
 each
 of
 them.
 Only


one
 of
 the
 summaries
 was
 released,


though.
 Officials
 haven't
 said
 why
 these


files
 weren't
 released,
 but
 the
 Justice


Department
 has
 told
 the
 Times
 that
 any


withheld
 files
 were
 either
 privileged
 or


duplicates
 and
 that
 files
 may
 be


withheld
 if
 they're
 part
 of
 an
 ongoing


federal
 investigation.


Trump
 has
 repeatedly
 denied
 any


wrongdoing.


And
 Dr.
 Casey
 Means,
 the
 wellness
 maja


influencer
 who's
 President
 Trump's


nominee
 to
 be
 surgeon
 general,
 testified


before
 the
 Senate
 at
 her
 confirmation


hearing
 on
 Wednesday.


If
 confirmed,
 she
 would
 carry
 the
 title


of
 the
 nation's
 doctor,
 even
 though
 she


doesn't
 have
 an
 active
 medical
 license,


and
 she's
 a
 vocal
 critic
 of
 the
 medical


establishment.


>> Would
 you
 encourage
 other
 mothers
 to


have
 their
 children
 vaccinated
 against


measles
 with
 the
 MMR
 vaccine?


>> During
 the
 hearing,
 Dr.
 mean
 said
 that


vaccines
 save
 lives,
 but
 she
 refused
 to


say
 whether
 she
 would
 urge
 parents
 to


vaccinate
 their
 children
 against
 the


measles.
 I'm
 supportive
 of
 vaccination.


Every
 individual
 needs
 to
 talk
 to
 their


doctor
 before
 putting
 a
 medication
 in


their
 body.


>> In
 one
 heated
 back
 and
 forth,
 Dr.
 Means


had
 a
 hard
 time
 answering
 a
 question


from
 Senator
 Tim
 Kaine
 of
 Virginia
 about


whether
 the
 flu
 vaccine
 was
 effective.


Do
 you
 believe
 that
 there's
 no
 evidence


that
 there's
 the
 flu
 vaccine
 has


efficacy
 in
 reducing
 serious
 injury
 or


hospitalization?


>> I
 I
 I


>> this
 is
 an
 easy
 one,
 doctor.


>> This
 is
 an
 easy
 one.


>> The
 Republican
 controlled
 Senate
 Health


Committee
 seemed
 poised
 to
 move
 Dr.


Mean's
 nomination
 to
 the
 Senate
 floor.
