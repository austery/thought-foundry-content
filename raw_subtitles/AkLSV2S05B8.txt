I'm going to show you what this thing looks like in reality. So let's just run it on an experiment result. So I've just said, please write up the experiment results for and I've given it the name of the experiment, which is vertical product tile images. And straight off, it's gone off and it's found its results. Great. It's found the rules. And now it's going to start working this all out for me. It has found everything we need. It's starting to write out the doc, which is nice to see. I'm just going to go ahead and queue up, turn this into a notion. So as soon as I've read it, while we look at the actual results, it will start writing the notion doc and let's have a look at these takeaways. So it's not only have we got more retailers, they're actually higher quality retailers, the ones we've got. So this looked good as a first pass. This looks. great. So as you can see, I've just asked for the Notion link and look straight away, I've got a nice document I can share around with everyone with all the right color codes, the takeaways and even as a little bonus, let's see if that always has trouble getting things in a little toggle, but right in the bottom here, I've even asked it to spit out a slack with an even more summarized version. So I can just drop this into the right view channels and straight away, this can go and get approved. Anyone in the business can start doing this, which means we can pass more and more of these things. down to engineers, PMs, other people to write this kind of stuff and do the analysis for them, which again can just massively accelerate our launch velocity affair, which we're really excited for.
