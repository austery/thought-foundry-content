From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Monday,
 January
 26th.
 Here's
 what
 we're


covering.


The
 second
 fatal
 shooting
 by
 federal


agents
 in
 Minneapolis
 has
 kicked
 off


what's
 become
 a
 new
 pattern
 from
 the


Trump
 administration
 of
 officials


immediately
 going
 on
 the
 offensive,


demonizing
 the
 victim,
 and
 often


distorting
 the
 facts
 of
 what
 happened.


On
 Saturday
 morning,
 Alex
 Prey,
 a


Minneapolis
 resident
 who
 worked
 as
 an


ICU
 nurse
 at
 the
 VA,
 had
 gathered
 with
 a


small
 group
 of
 protesters
 near
 where


federal
 agents
 were
 operating.
 These


kinds
 of
 scenes
 have
 become
 common
 in


Minneapolis
 and
 across
 the
 country.


Demonstrators
 opposed
 to
 the


administration's
 aggressive
 immigration


enforcement
 come
 to
 blow
 whistles
 or


record
 on
 their
 phones.
 Videos
 show
 Prey


stepped
 between
 a
 woman
 and
 an
 agent
 who


was
 pepper-spraying
 her.
 He
 was
 then


pepper-sprayed
 and
 a
 group
 of
 agents


piled
 onto
 him.
 They
 pinned
 him
 down
 and


appeared
 to
 pull
 a
 handgun
 off
 of
 PR's


hip
 before
 agents
 opened
 fire,
 killing


him.
 Video
 show
 Prey,
 who
 had
 a
 permit


to
 carry
 a
 firearm,
 never
 drew
 his


weapon.


>> This
 looks
 like
 a
 situation
 where
 an


individual
 arrived
 at
 the
 scene
 to


inflict
 maximum
 damage
 on
 individuals


and
 to
 kill
 law
 enforcement.
 Secretary


of
 Homeland
 Security
 Christy
 Gnome


immediately
 claimed
 Preydy
 assaulted
 the


officers.


>> You
 do
 not
 get
 to
 attack
 law
 enforcement


officials
 in
 this
 country
 without
 any


repercussions.


>> That
 was
 echoed
 by
 the
 head
 of
 the
 FBI,


Cash
 Patel.


>> The
 suspect
 put
 himself
 in
 that


situation.
 The
 victims
 are
 the
 border


patrol
 agents
 there


>> and
 by
 a
 senior
 border
 patrol
 official,


Gregory
 Bo.
 Steven
 Miller,
 one
 of


President
 Trump's
 top
 advisers,
 went


further,
 calling
 Freddy
 a
 would-be


assassin
 and
 a
 domestic
 terrorist.


Administration
 officials
 made
 similar


claims
 with
 no
 evidence
 about
 Renee


Good,
 who
 was
 killed
 in
 her
 car
 by
 an


ICE
 agent
 in
 Minneapolis
 earlier
 this


year.


>> I'm
 rejecting
 the
 rush
 to
 judgment


within
 15
 minutes
 of
 this,
 which
 they


did
 last
 time.
 They're
 telling
 you
 not


to
 trust
 your
 eyes
 and
 ear,
 not
 to
 trust


the
 facts
 that
 you're
 seeing
 in
 front
 of


them.
 Minnesota
 Governor
 Tim
 Walls
 said


he
 had
 called
 the
 White
 House
 to
 demand


that
 the
 state
 handle
 the
 investigation


into
 PR's
 death,
 saying
 the
 federal


government
 cannot
 be
 trusted.
 Despite


that,
 state
 authorities
 say
 they've
 been


cut
 out
 again
 like
 they
 were
 after
 Goods


killing
 over
 the
 weekend.
 They
 took
 the


extraordinary
 measure
 of
 getting
 an


emergency
 court
 order
 to
 bar
 federal


officials
 from
 destroying
 any
 evidence.


Still,
 they
 say
 they
 haven't
 received


basic
 facts
 from
 the
 government,
 like


the
 identities
 of
 the
 agents
 who
 opened


fire.


In
 Washington,
 meanwhile,
 the
 uproar


over
 PR's
 killing
 could
 lead
 to
 a


partial
 government
 shutdown
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 week.
 The
 Senate
 was
 set
 to
 vote


on
 legislation
 that
 funds
 a
 broad
 range


of
 government
 programs.
 But
 some
 key


Democrats
 now
 say
 they're
 opposed
 to
 it


since
 it
 includes
 over
 $60
 billion
 for


DHS,
 including
 $10
 billion
 specifically


for
 ICE.


>> I
 I
 hate
 shutdowns.
 I'm
 one
 of
 the


people
 that
 helped
 negotiate
 the
 the


solution
 to
 the
 last
 the
 end
 of
 the
 last


shutdown,
 but
 I
 can't
 vote
 for
 a
 bill


that
 includes
 ICE
 funding
 under
 these


circumstances.
 what
 they're
 doing.


>> Senator
 Angus
 King,
 an
 independent
 from


Maine,
 where
 federal
 agents
 have
 also


launched
 a
 ramped
 up
 immigration


enforcement
 operation,
 said
 on
 CBS


yesterday
 that
 he
 shared
 Democrats


concerns
 and
 that
 ICE
 funding
 should
 be


voted
 on
 separately.


>> Let's
 have
 an
 honest
 negotiation,
 put


some
 guard
 rails
 on
 what's
 going
 on,


some
 accountability,
 and
 that
 would


solve
 this
 problem.
 We
 don't
 have
 to


have
 a
 shutdown.


>> At
 least
 one
 Republican
 senator
 has
 also


raised
 concerns
 about
 the
 shooting.
 Bill


Cassidy
 of
 Louisiana
 said
 it
 was


incredibly
 disturbing
 and
 called
 for
 a


joint
 federal
 state
 investigation,


saying,
 quote,
 "The
 credibility
 of
 ICE


and
 DHS
 are
 at
 stake.


The
 gigantic
 winter
 storm
 that
 crossed


over
 much
 of
 the
 US
 this
 weekend
 brought


record-breaking
 low
 temperatures,
 dumped


more
 than
 a
 foot
 of
 snow
 in
 17
 states,


and
 knocked
 out
 power
 for
 hundreds
 of


thousands
 of
 people.


>> It's
 getting
 a
 lot
 worse.
 The
 snow


coming
 down
 at
 a
 much
 heavier
 pace


compared
 to
 earlier
 where
 it
 was
 coming.


>> The
 National
 Weather
 Service
 said
 Bonito


Lake,
 New
 Mexico
 got
 the
 most
 snow
 of


anywhere
 in
 the
 country,
 recording
 31


in.
 Again,
 it's
 just
 waves
 of
 snow
 that


you're


>> The
 heavy
 snow
 combined
 with
 ice
 in
 the


south
 caused
 chaos
 for
 travelers.


Yesterday,
 nearly
 40%
 of
 all
 flights
 in


the
 country
 were
 cancelled.
 The
 storm


also
 turned
 deadly
 in
 some
 states.
 At


least
 11
 people
 from
 Texas
 to
 New
 York


died
 amid
 the
 bitter
 cold.
 Forecasters


are
 now
 warning
 that
 those
 dangerous


conditions
 could
 remain
 for
 days.
 About


80%
 of
 Americans
 will
 see
 freezing


temperatures
 in
 the
 next
 week.
 And
 many


cities
 have
 been
 rushing
 to
 open
 warming


centers
 for
 those
 affected
 by
 the
 cold.


About
 a
 decade
 ago,
 genetic
 researchers


started
 recruiting
 kids
 across
 the
 US


for
 an
 ambitious
 study
 to
 track
 brain


development.
 They
 did
 MRIs,
 clinical


tests,
 and
 took
 DNA
 samples,
 telling


parents
 that
 it
 could
 help
 lead
 to


breakthrough
 discoveries.
 They
 also
 told


the
 families
 that
 all
 that
 sensitive


data
 would
 be
 closely
 guarded
 by
 the


National
 Institutes
 of
 Health.
 That
 is


not
 what
 happened.


Instead,
 a
 group
 of
 fringe
 researchers


got
 around
 the
 NIH's
 safeguards
 and


access
 data
 from
 over
 20,000
 kids.
 They


used
 it
 to
 turn
 out
 at
 least
 16
 papers


arguing
 things
 like
 white
 people
 are


intellectually
 superior
 or
 ranking


ethnicities
 by
 IQ
 scores.
 Those


conclusions
 which
 mainstream
 scientists


have
 rejected
 as
 biased
 and
 unscientific


have
 become
 fodder
 for
 racist
 posts
 that


have
 gone
 viral
 on
 social
 media.
 And


some
 of
 the
 papers
 are
 being
 cited
 by
 AI


bots
 like
 Chad
 GPT
 and
 Grock.
 The


national
 co-director
 of
 the
 original


study
 called
 this
 use
 of
 the
 data
 evil,


saying,
 quote,
 "It's
 not
 just
 that
 the


science
 is
 faulty,
 but
 it's
 being
 used


to
 advance
 an
 unethical
 agenda."


The
 misuse
 of
 the
 data
 has
 underscored


broader
 concerns
 about
 the
 security
 of


genetic
 information
 at
 the
 NIH.
 The


agency
 grants
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of


requests
 from
 researchers
 to
 use
 its


databases.
 But
 the
 Times
 has
 found
 that


in
 dozens
 of
 cases,
 data
 was
 made


vulnerable
 to
 theft,
 used
 for
 unapproved


purposes,
 or
 released
 improperly.


For
 example,
 2
 years
 ago,
 an


unidentified
 researcher
 in
 China
 was


able
 to
 access
 Americans
 genetic


information,
 even
 though
 it's
 not


supposed
 to
 be
 shared
 with
 people
 in


adversarial
 countries
 that
 could
 use
 it


for
 blackmail
 or
 military
 purposes.
 In
 a


statement,
 an
 NIH
 official
 said
 the


agency
 has
 taken
 new
 steps
 to
 protect


data,
 including
 the
 brain
 development


study.
 Though
 one
 geneticist
 who
 filed
 a


complaint
 with
 the
 agency
 about
 the
 way


data
 is
 handled,
 told
 the
 Times,
 "Our


scientific
 institutions
 sort
 of
 assume


good
 faith
 in
 people."
 And
 he
 added,


quote,
 "There
 needs
 to
 be
 an


acknowledgement
 that
 there
 are
 bad
 faith


researchers."


And
 finally,


>> dry
 January
 day
 25,
 four
 weekends
 in
 a


row.


>> This
 is
 the
 month
 every
 year
 when


millions
 of
 Americans
 rethink
 their


relationship
 with
 alcohol.
 Either
 going


sober,
 going
 kind
 of
 sober.
 Now,
 many


people
 are
 going
 Cali
 sober.


>> Well,
 Cali
 sober,
 if
 you
 don't
 know
 what


it
 is,
 is
 typically
 using
 marijuana
 uh


in
 your
 sobriety.
 So,
 you're
 not


drinking
 or
 not
 using


>> liquor
 sales
 during
 the
 month
 of
 January


are
 bleak
 and
 they've
 been
 consistently


losing
 ground
 to
 THC
 infused
 drinks
 like


mocktails,
 selzers,
 and
 teas.


Manufacturers
 of
 the
 drinks
 say
 their


customers
 aren't
 just
 young
 people.


They're
 also
 seeing
 rising
 interest
 from


older
 women
 in
 particular
 who
 are
 trying


them
 amid
 concerns
 about
 links
 between


alcohol
 and
 various
 diseases.


Despite
 that
 growing
 market
 though,
 the


whole
 industry
 could
 be
 at
 risk
 of


disappearing.
 A
 federal
 law
 kicks
 in


this
 November
 that
 puts
 strict
 new


limits
 on
 the
 amount
 of
 THC
 that
 can
 be


in
 products
 like
 those
 drinks.
 While


some
 of
 the
 beverages
 currently
 have
 5


to
 10
 mg,
 the
 new
 limit
 will
 be
 4
 mg.


The
 CEO
 of
 an
 industry
 group
 told
 the


Times
 that
 could
 be
 devastating
 for


business.
 quote,
 "It's
 like
 saying
 you


can
 still
 buy
 pens,
 but
 they
 won't
 have


any
 ink
 in
 them."


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.

Mumford.
 We'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow.
