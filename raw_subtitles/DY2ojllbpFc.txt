Most people live in a “win-lose” paradigm,
where self-interest is a thing
they think of the most.
There's a better way.
A “win-win-win” paradigm.
And this is more
than just a game metaphor.
It's a philosophy of human interaction
that seeks mutual benefit for everyone.
I had a major epiphany
in the early days of Whole Foods
that helped me wake up
to this idea of a win-win-win way of life.
It was Memorial Day, 1981,
the very first Whole Foods we ever had
went through the worst flood
that Austin, Texas had experienced
in over 70 years.
Overnight, our store
was completely destroyed.
We were near bankruptcy.
It looked like our story had ended
only nine months after we'd started it.
And then something really cool happened.
When I went to the store
the next morning to help clean up,
there were a lot of people
there helping us.
Our team members were there, of course,
but so were our customers
and so were our neighbors.
And I was deeply moved by this.
They were helping us
because they loved our store
and they didn't want us to die.
Over the next 30 days,
our team members worked for free
until we could get back open
to begin to pay them.
Our suppliers fronted us more inventory,
our investors invested more capital,
and our local bank loaned us more money.
Whole Foods was resurrected from death
by this interconnected
group of stakeholders
who saw our success
as their own success.
Whole Foods surviving meant
that we were all simultaneously winning.
This had a profound effect on me.
I had always thought
business was just about kind of,
you know, making money,
serving customers and making money.
But for the first time, I began to see,
no, it's part of this larger community
there’s a Whole Foods “family,”
there’s a Whole Foods
network of relationships.
And I began to see that my job
was to nurture that community,
nurture that network,
take care of all of the stakeholders.
Ever since the flood,
I have been trying to apply
this framework of win-win-win,
not just to business,
but to everyday life.
And I have found it
to be a universal ethical framework.
It is useful
in almost every situation
you can find yourself in.
So what is win-win-win?
It means you're looking
for the good of the person
you're interacting with,
you're looking for the good for yourself,
and you're looking for the good
for the larger community.
Let me give you an example.
So at Whole Foods, we struggled,
as we began to build up our supply chain
internationally for produce,
we struggled with how can we
do this with ethical trade?
How can we ensure that we have
better working conditions,
higher pay,
environmental sustainability
and community development?
That was our challenge.
And so we created our Whole Trade program.
And we worked with certifiers
such as Fair Trade and Rainforest Alliance
to help ensure that the farming
communities that we worked with
lived up to those ethical standards.
It was very transformative.
And this ended up being a huge success.
And it was a win for the farmers,
because they got access to larger markets.
It was a win for their communities,
because one of the things
we had was social premiums.
The farmer communities decided
how to spend that money.
Some spent it on opening schools,
others medical clinics,
others did community centers.
And there were many, many other things.
So the farming communities
were benefiting.
Whole Foods was also winning
because we had, well,
we had ethical trade.
Our customers liked that.
We also had higher quality products
and we were able to have
competitive differentiation as well.
So this is all great.
What happens when we have conflicts?
Conflicts happen all the time.
Well one thing that happens
when you’re working
from a win-win-win-framework
is you have a lot fewer conflicts.
The reason why is you can solve problems
before they escalate
to even become conflicts.
One of the ways that you do that
is that you have to do three things.
To put win-win-win
into practice means that one,
you have to have a mind shift.
You have to be able
to shift out of strict self-interest.
You have to be able to take
the perspective of other people.
Number two, you have
to have a heart shift.
You have to be able to open your heart,
let go of your ego and your defensiveness,
and open up with empathy,
with better listening skills.
And third, you have to unleash
your creative imagination
because it's the creative
imagination that will come up
with the win-win-win
solutions that we need.
So ...
Let me give you an example
of a time we had a win-lose situation
that we turned into a win-win-win.
The most important acquisition
that Whole Foods ever did
was back in late 1992,
about one year after we'd done
our initial public offering.
Bread and Circus, a company
very similar to Whole Foods,
they had six stores at that time
located in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
And I was very good friends
with the owner of Bread and Circus,
Anthony Harnett.
And he and I had been talking for a while
about Bread and Circus
selling to Whole Foods,
and I wanted to buy it for Whole Foods,
and Anthony wanted to sell it.
The problem was, he wanted
30 million dollars for his business,
and it was losing money at that time.
So there's no way I could sell it
to our board of directors.
So we sort of were in an impasse.
Five million dollars apart, approximately.
And so the win-win-win solution
to that was he wanted all cash.
We couldn't get there.
So I said, "Anthony,
what we can do is I can do
part cash and part stock,
but we can get the stock price up."
He didn't like that idea at first,
he thought that was very risky
because he was going to be risking
that maybe the stock wouldn't trade up.
Here's the thing.
I had made a heart shift,
Anthony became convinced
that I wanted what was best for everyone,
including him,
that he could see I genuinely wanted
to get his 30 million to him.
So I asked him to trust me.
I'll get it.
And he did.
So we announced it publicly,
Whole Foods Market stock rocketed up,
and it went up even more
after I went on the road show
and began to tout it
to the investment community.
Anthony ended up getting 32 million.
So it was a huge win for him.
But it was even a bigger win
for Whole Foods,
because Bread and Circus
had tremendous expertise
in produce, meat and seafood.
We put that into Whole Foods
and it transformed our company.
That was the foundation
for the explosive growth
that Whole Foods Market underwent
over the next 30 years.
When that merger happened,
we were at 100 million dollars in sales.
Thirty years later,
we were over 20 billion dollars in sales.
(Applause)
It was also a win for the entire
natural and organic-foods industry,
because our growth enabled
literally tens of thousands
of farmers, ranchers,
food manufacturers
from all around the natural
and organic-foods industry
to have tremendous financial success
due to Whole Foods Market success.
That was the larger community
that all benefited from it.
So if you want to be good at win-win-win,
you have to practice it.
But here's the thing -- it's a skill.
But it's a skill very,
very worthwhile to master
because it's going to serve you
in so many different ways in your life.
I'm going to conclude by just
telling you a little story.
I was talking about win-win-win
with my wife Deborah,
and she said, "You know, John,
I think it's even simpler
than you're putting it."
And I said, "How is it simpler?"
She said, "Look, just love everyone
all the time,
no exceptions."
(Laughter)
She's right.
Because love is the ultimate
win-win-win strategy.
And I wish for all of you
great love in your lives.
And I hope together
we'll practice win-win-win.
Thank you so very much.
(Applause)
