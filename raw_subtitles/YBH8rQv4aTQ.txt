Twenty years ago,
I founded a social enterprise.
I wanted to change the world.
And we were funding millions
of meals to the underprivileged.
We were providing tens of thousands
of vaccines across parts of Africa.
And we were funding schools
in the slums of India.
Now I thought that I was doing
quite a good job
and having a lot
of impact in all of these areas,
until one day I was working
with ministers in the UK,
and they said that 20 percent of students
leave secondary schools in the UK
and they're not able to read
and write well enough.
Now I thought with brick and mortar
schools and qualified teachers,
if they're not able to do that in the UK,
then I'm not having the impact
that I wanted to have in those schools,
in the slums in India.
So what's going on?
What's the problem?
We need to fix it.
So I went to schools.
I went to schools
and I asked lots of questions.
And I found two critical problems
on the front line of education.
The first is that they continue
to have the one-size-fits-all
delivery of education
to a classroom of around 30 to 35 people.
The second, I think
you will agree with me,
should be headline news every single day.
74 percent of teachers
want to quit their jobs
in the next three years.
Why?
It's because of workload.
They spend so much time
micro-marking, micro-assessing,
trying to figure out
where every child is at.
They are teachers by day,
and they are data analysts by night.
And not one of them signed up
to do that night job.
So walking around schools,
I had a smartphone in my hand,
and we had machine-learning applications
telling us how we should shop,
how we should save and sleep.
And I thought, why don't we have
this technology in the classroom,
telling us how we should learn?
We’ve got to build that technology.
But we can’t use any old
machine learning recommendation engine.
We need to combine artificial intelligence
with neuroscientific theory
and the learning sciences
to learn how every single brain
in this room learns.
Because if we can fix learning,
we can improve outcomes.
We can personalize education
for every single one of us
and provide intelligent insights
to teachers to reduce the workload.
So 12 years ago, I built a team.
They built the technology.
It exists, students use it
in over 140 countries.
We've collected over 40 billion
data points on how children learn.
And I'm going to show you
a couple of the things
that I've learned
about learning on the way.
But before I do that,
I thought it would be
really important to share with you
some student feedback
that I have on our platform.
It’s really important
because it tells us
what children’s expectations are
when they use an AI education partner.
So I get feedback like this.
"I'm trying to say thank you."
"It's lovely." "It's brilliant."
"I think Century will help me achieve
things that I thought were impossible."
It's a golden child, right?
My life's purpose has been fulfilled.
And then these sweet, lovely, innocent
children send me messages like this.
“I don’t like this website,
it makes me able to do my homework.”
(Laughter)
Wait.
And then I'm being bribed.
"I will give you 100,000
pounds, I'm not joking.
You just need to give me no work.
Give me a button to do the work for me."
Now these children and that sentiment
very much ties in with a recent survey
where children were asked,
how do you use AI LLMs,
chatbots, with your homework?
A staggering fifth of children admitted
they get AI to do
all of their work for them.
So they're not using AI
to help them learn.
They're using AI
to actively avoid learning.
Now I know some of you are frowning
right now thinking, how dare they?
I don't think they're
that different from us.
Think about how we felt
when we first used ChatGPT.
This is my very scientific chart.
I think that you all felt euphoric.
You thought, "Wow,
I'm going to look like a genius.
I never need to do any work ever again.
This is amazing."
Yeah?
And then it hallucinated and confabulated.
And you were, like, "Big tech, seriously,
you had one job to do, Sam Altman,
with all that money,
and it's making stuff up," right?
And then for the lawyer who shared it
in a courtroom and got fined,
sheer humiliation and embarrassment
for those people.
And I think we've ended up with this
sort of sinking realization of acceptance,
right, that the shortcuts
don't really replace the work.
They're very helpful.
But we still need to learn,
we need to produce, and we need to think.
Now when we read those long answers
that an LLM chatbot gives us,
it feels very fluent
when you read it, doesn't it?
The problem is, is that fluency
we often mistake for learning,
and that is why people we know,
not us, of course,
but they end up with this sort
of illusion of competence,
like they know everything, right?
What we actually know about learning
is that learning requires
what researchers call
a “productive struggle.”
It's this sort of mental effort,
right, that builds understanding.
Now my top learning techniques,
I’ve got four of them that all
involve a productive struggle,
and they improve outcomes.
We've seen them work.
Three of them are about memory.
This is really important.
Memory and understanding
are two sides of the same coin.
If you think about it,
we draw on what we remember
in order to shape what we think.
If we can't recall it, we can't use it.
So the first important one is retrieval.
This is simply the act
of recalling from our brains.
The students in a study
were given a passage like this one.
And it's the students
who only read it once,
but then tried to recall
it from their memory,
who could remember it far better
than students who just read it
over and over and over again.
The second is spacing,
and this is essentially students
who then space their learning over time.
So rather than cramming
things all in one go,
students that can do that active process
of retrieval over time,
because then you're essentially
going through that productive struggle
over and over again.
The third, we don't like this one,
but it's just generation, right?
So students in a study
were given word pairs
like rapid-fast and cold and hot.
But then another set of students
were just given the first word.
And then a cue like the F,
they had to come up with "fast."
Students who have to generate
the answers themselves,
even if they get them wrong initially,
create a stronger memory trace.
They remember more in the end.
And then the fourth is reflection.
When we reflect on our work
and we are given structured
feedback in three very specific ways:
How am I learning right now?
What is my learning goal,
and then what are the gaps
to get to that goal, what do I need to do?
Those students improve their outcomes.
Now you'll find that these four
techniques have something in common.
They are harder.
They all involve a productive struggle.
We know sustained mental effort
strengthens the parts of the brain,
and it's positively correlated
with growth in the brain.
There was an amazing study
in my home city of London
with black taxi drivers.
Now if you’re a cabbie in London,
you have to pass a test
called The Knowledge.
You have to memorize 26,000 streets
in the city of London.
You're not allowed to use navigation apps.
Wow, exactly, right?
Isn't that crazy?
Yeah, no Uber drivers for them, right?
And so neuroscientists
scanned their brains
and they found that parts
of the hippocampus in the brain,
this is the part of the brain
that's responsible
for spatial memory and navigation,
were larger in parts
with experienced cabbies.
Because you have to build
all of those mental models,
you have to generate new routes
every time you have a new passenger.
And so they say that that growth,
because of the positive correlation
with what they have to do,
is really meaningful and telling,
and it is no different for learning.
Durable learning does not
come from shortcuts.
It comes from certain types of effort.
And this is why
AI is amazing for education.
Because AI can spot patterns
in how we all learn.
It can spot patterns in how
concepts across subjects connect.
It can predict if you don't know something
and provide you with that material
at the right time,
it can provide us with timely,
targeted interventions
and give teachers those insights.
It can predict when you're just
about to forget something
and give you that material
at just the right time,
it can force you to generate an answer
rather than just reveal the answer.
And it can provide amazing,
structured feedback
against expertly designed
rubrics from teachers.
So AI well-designed
can be phenomenal in education.
And we've seen it work.
Now a lot of people come to me,
students and adults,
and they say, but why bother?
Because we've got GPS, right?
We have AI, we can Google the answer
to absolutely anything
so we don't need to do this anymore.
That's not true.
If you think about AI,
AI is our history predicting our future.
It is brilliant at spotting
patterns in data.
It has been amazing as a partner
in remarkable breakthroughs
like drug discovery and protein folding,
new materials and crystals.
But the thing is, none of that happens
with AI in isolation.
We humans, we frame the questions.
We set the goals, we chose the data sets.
We decide which discoveries matter.
Our knowledge is not just trivia.
It is the raw material
of thinking and discovery.
AI is not there to replace our expertise.
It's there to allow
our expertise to expand.
And if you think about powered flight,
penicillin, electricity, AI itself,
humans learned.
They went through
that productive struggle, right?
They built domain expertise,
and from that they took
a leap in their imagination
and they created innovations.
So for students who want to cheat
and want to use AI to do their homework,
for us lifelong learners, right,
who are reading and reading
and reading and reinforcing
that illusion of competence,
just remember, you do not get the growth
unless you go through the struggle.
So whether AI is good or bad
for education is totally up to you.
Are we designing it well
and are you using it to complement
or to replace human cognition?
So the next time you're learning
and you want to invest in yourself,
educate yourself,
you want to grow and maybe
take that leap in imagination,
just remember, mental effort
is not a flaw in the process.
It is a critical feature
that allows learning to stick,
allows us to build expertise
and fuel human ingenuity.
Thank you so much for listening to me,
and good luck with your AI journey.
(Applause and cheers)
