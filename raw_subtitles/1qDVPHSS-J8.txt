All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 another
 episode
 of
 the
 market


futures.
 It's
 been
 two
 weeks
 since
 we


did
 the
 future
 show.
 Uh,
 two
 weeks
 ago


it
 was
 Sunday
 for
 Thanksgiving
 and
 the


week
 after
 that
 I
 got
 sick.
 But
 I
 am


back.
 Happy
 to
 be
 back.
 It's
 always
 fun


to
 do
 these
 on
 a
 Sunday
 and
 get
 ready


for
 what
 hopefully
 will
 not
 be
 a


tumultuous
 week
 as
 we
 enter
 the
 week


before
 Christmas,
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 crazy


in
 and
 of
 itself
 to
 say
 that
 uh
 yeah,


this
 is
 the
 week
 before
 Christmas.
 It's


this
 final
 this
 is
 the
 third
 week
 of


December.
 We
 have
 then
 the
 fourth
 week


we're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 shortened
 week


because
 of
 Christmas.
 And
 so


realistically,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


decisions
 around
 how
 we
 are
 going
 to
 end


out
 the
 year,
 what
 the
 S&P
 is
 ultimately


going
 to
 do,
 kind
 of
 if
 we
 end
 out,
 risk


on,
 risk
 off.
 We've
 got
 Bitcoin
 red,


futures
 red
 right
 now.
 We're
 going to


see
 how
 that
 kind
 of
 turns
 out
 to
 be


tomorrow
 morning.
 And
 we
 got
 a
 bunch
 of


headlines
 to
 discuss
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 what


could
 end
 up
 being
 red
 or
 green
 for


tomorrow.
 But
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the


big
 week.
 And
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 data


coming
 out
 this
 week.
 We
 have
 a
 lot
 of


Fed
 talk
 this
 week.
 You
 have
 potentially


a
 new
 Fed
 Federal
 Reserve
 chair


announcement
 by
 Trump
 this
 week.
 You


have
 CPI
 this
 week.
 You
 have
 jobs
 data


on
 the
 16th
 in
 two
 days.
 So,
 there
 is
 a


lot
 of
 stuff
 going
 on
 this
 week.
 As
 you


can
 see
 right
 here,
 Bitcoin
 88,314


as
 that
 is
 down
 about
 $2,000
 on
 the
 day,


down
 about
 2%.
 Um,
 so
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a


big
 week
 and
 hopefully
 it
 is
 a
 week
 that


is
 a
 bit
 prettier
 than
 what
 we
 saw
 on


Friday.
 We'll
 also
 recap
 what
 we
 had
 on


Friday.
 Futures
 went
 green.
 Oh,
 last


time
 I
 saw
 them,
 they
 were
 red.
 Let
 me


pull
 them
 up
 again.
 They
 were
 actually


green
 when
 they
 opened
 and
 then
 they


turned
 red
 within
 30
 minutes.


Bitcoin
 is
 not
 Oh,
 no.
 They
 went
 green.


There
 you
 go.
 They
 did
 go
 green.
 Oh,


that's
 nice
 to
 see.
 It
 has
 been
 uh
 two


weeks
 in
 a
 row
 of
 red
 futures.
 Yeah,


there
 you
 go.
 Futures
 are


indeed
 green.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 talk


about
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 those
 futures


as
 we
 get
 into
 it.
 Uh,
 and
 hopefully
 it


implicates
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 week.
 But


also,
 we
 had
 a
 crazy
 Friday.
 I
 mean,


just
 an
 absolutely
 crazy
 Friday.
 For


those
 that
 missed
 it,
 we
 had
 a
 headline


around
 opening
 eye
 and
 Oracle.
 We'll


dissect
 that
 headline
 again.
 That


headline
 in
 and
 of
 itself,
 there's
 the


futures
 right
 there
 going
 green.
 Uh,


completely
 changed
 the
 trajectory
 of
 the


day.
 Even
 though
 the
 headline
 in
 my


opinion
 was
 a
 nothing
 burger,
 but
 we'll


go
 through
 it.
 Had
 a
 couple
 banks
 put


out
 their
 reports
 on
 how
 they
 think
 of


the
 headline.
 We'll
 see
 if
 the
 market


actually
 wants
 to
 interpret
 it
 as
 a
 big


deal
 or
 if
 it
 uh
 ends
 up
 becoming
 not


that
 big
 of
 a
 deal.
 Thank
 everybody
 for


being
 here.
 Got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.


Hopefully
 everyone
 had
 a
 great
 weekend.


Uh,
 I
 hope
 people
 enjoyed
 the
 stream
 on


Friday
 with
 my
 new
 manager.
 Shout
 out
 to


Jess.
 We
 officially
 launched
 details
 for


the
 meetup.
 I'm
 putting
 the
 link
 right


here
 in
 the
 chat.
 It
 is
 also
 in
 the


description.
 So,
 New
 York
 City,


February.
 It's
 technically
 New
 Jersey,


but
 it's
 like
 really
 close
 to
 New
 York.


So,
 I
 mean,
 it's
 I
 guess
 let's
 just
 call


it
 New
 York
 New
 Jersey
 meetup.
 Uh,
 but


there's
 the
 link
 right
 there
 in
 the


chat.
 February
 1st.
 Uh,
 it's
 going
 to
 be


very,
 very
 excited.
 We
 already
 have
 a


bunch
 of
 you
 that
 signed
 up
 for
 it.
 And


yeah,
 that
 is
 officially
 live.
 We
 had
 a


couple
 other
 announcements
 that
 went


live
 during
 that
 stream.
 So,
 if
 you


haven't
 watched
 it,
 I
 would
 definitely


recommend
 checking
 it
 out.
 And


um
 yeah,
 we
 are
 officially
 starting
 this


new
 era
 of
 essentially,
 I
 guess,
 a
 more


structure
 and
 organized
 way
 to
 manage
 AK


media,
 which
 is
 not
 even
 really
 a
 thing,


but
 nonetheless,
 it
 has
 become
 a
 thing.


So,
 I'm
 very
 very
 excited
 for
 it.
 Uh


Jess
 really
 enjoyed
 the
 stream.
 It
 was


fun.
 Obviously
 the
 uh
 the
 comments
 were


phenomenal
 to
 to
 say
 the
 least.
 Uh
 but


it
 was
 a
 good
 time.
 It
 was
 exciting
 and


you
 know
 as
 someone
 who
 is
 going
 to
 be


intimately
 involved
 in
 the
 community


given
 how
 you
 know
 close
 of
 a
 community


we
 have
 uh
 I
 do
 think
 it
 was
 important


for
 her
 to
 meet
 the
 community
 and
 you


know
 kind
 of
 see
 you
 guys
 up
 in
 front
 in


the
 chat
 and
 obviously
 she'll
 be
 at
 the


meetups
 and
 so
 it'll
 be
 super
 fun
 to
 to


get
 things
 going.
 So
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a


good
 time.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 to
 do.


Uh
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 that
 we
 had.
 We


had
 a
 meeting
 Saturday
 morning
 right


after
 that
 stream
 on
 Friday
 to
 get
 even


more
 logistics.
 This
 is
 what
 I
 love


about
 her.
 Like
 she
 works
 really
 hard,


dude.
 Like
 really
 freaking
 hard.
 So


Saturday
 morning
 it
 was
 like,
 "All


right,
 we
 got
 five
 things
 we
 got
 to
 get


off
 the
 checklist."
 Like,
 and
 this
 is


what
 I
 think
 I've
 been
 missing.
 You


know,
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 building
 the


brand
 has
 been
 me
 and
 my
 work
 ethic,
 you


know,
 trying
 to
 make
 things
 happen,


which
 I
 think
 I
 have
 a
 relatively
 strong


work
 ethic,
 but
 there's
 only
 so
 much
 you


can
 do
 before,
 you
 know,
 you
 just
 burn


out
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 you
 need
 someone
 to


take
 a
 lot
 of the
 load
 off
 off
 what


you're
 trying
 to
 get
 done.
 So,
 very


excited
 for
 this
 next
 evolution
 of
 the


brand
 and
 I
 think
 2026
 will
 be
 very


exciting
 and
 uh
 we'll
 get
 things
 going


from
 there.
 All
 right,
 so
 we
 got
 a
 lot


to
 talk
 about,
 dude.
 Football
 today.


Crazy.


Rest
 up.
 Patty
 Mahomes
 tore
 his
 ACL.


I
 mean,
 that
 was
 tough
 to
 see.
 That
 was


very,
 very
 I
 didn't
 watch
 the
 whole


game,
 but
 I
 got
 like
 the
 details
 right


at
 the
 very
 end
 of
 it.
 End
 of
 a
 dynasty


for
 the
 Chiefs.
 I
 mean,
 three
 Super


Bowls
 in
 the
 past
 five
 years.
 I
 think


they
 got
 to
 the
 the
 the
 AFC
 Championship


round
 pretty
 much
 every
 time
 over
 the


past
 like
 seven
 years
 or
 something
 like


that.
 Now,
 they
 can't
 even
 make
 the


playoffs.
 So
 yeah,
 sucks
 for
 Patty


Mahomes,
 but
 he's
 an
 absolute
 winner,


absolute
 champion.
 You
 know,
 ironically,


Tom
 Brady
 in
 his
 uh
 ninth
 season
 also


had
 an
 injury.
 So
 Patrick
 Mahomes
 career


and
 by
 then
 he
 had
 already
 won
 three


Super
 Bowl
 titles.
 So
 Patrick
 Mahomes


and
 Tom
 Brady,
 their
 careers
 are
 kind
 of


going
 in
 the
 same
 trajectory.
 But
 yeah,


Chiefs
 are
 going to
 be
 out
 uh
 for
 for


the
 football
 season
 now.
 All right,
 so


we
 got
 about
 nine
 minutes
 until
 the


futures
 open.
 Again,
 thank
 you
 everybody


for
 being
 here.
 I
 think
 we'll
 get


started
 with
 a
 recap
 of
 what
 happened
 on


uh
 on
 Friday
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going


from
 there
 and
 uh
 we'll
 discuss
 how
 we


think
 these
 futures
 will
 open.
 Uh
 Usama


says
 already
 bought
 tickets.
 Excited
 for


our
 first
 meetup.
 Usama
 excited
 to
 see


you
 there.
 Lone
 life
 says
 bought


tickets.
 Thank
 you.
 Excited
 to
 see
 you


there.
 The
 tickets
 will
 cost
 $75.
 Tried


to
 make
 them
 super
 cheap.
 We
 do
 have
 a


lot
 of
 cost
 to
 cover
 in
 terms
 of
 venue,


food,
 etc.
 Security.
 So,
 uh
 yeah,
 we're


not
 really
 making
 a
 margin
 on
 the
 75.
 In


fact,
 even
 after
 I
 did
 all
 the
 numbers,


I
 think
 I'm
 probably
 going
 to
 lose
 a


couple
 grand
 on
 this,
 but
 that's
 okay


because
 the
 goal
 of
 the
 meetups
 are
 to


uh
 strengthen
 and
 establish
 this


community
 more
 so
 than
 make
 money.
 Maybe


one
 day
 in
 the
 future,
 we
 have
 events


that
 actually
 make
 money,
 but
 it's
 not


the
 time
 for
 that.
 So,
 uh
 very
 excited


for
 those
 that
 show
 up.
 And
 if
 you
 want


to
 make
 a
 trip
 out
 of
 New
 York,
 uh
 12
 to


6,
 February
 1st,
 hopefully
 this
 can
 be


on
 your
 agenda.
 And
 I
 think
 it'll
 be
 a


fun
 time
 to
 see
 everybody
 that
 comes


there.
 All
 right,
 so


let's
 get
 started.
 What
 happened
 on


Friday?
 Um,
 link
 for
 the
 meetup.
 Yes,


it's
 in
 the
 description.
 Let
 me
 put
 it


right
 here
 in
 the
 chat
 as
 well.
 I
 know
 a


lot of
 people
 are going
 to
 ask
 for
 the


link,
 so
 let
 me
 just
 put
 it
 in
 the
 chat.


But
 this
 is
 the
 link
 for
 the
 meet
 up.
 So


on
 Friday,
 everything
 was
 going
 good
 and


then
 we
 had
 a
 market
 downturn
 kind
 of.
 I


mean,
 it
 was
 a
 1.5%
 move
 on
 the
 S&P
 500.


Then
 it
 ended
 up
 down
 1%.
 Robin
 Hood
 got


hit.
 BMR
 got
 hit.
 Broadcom
 just


absolutely
 disgusting.
 at
 Broadcom
 I


don't
 think
 was
 necessarily
 related
 to


just
 like
 the
 Friday
 price
 action.
 I


think
 that
 you
 know
 they
 they
 they
 said


some
 stuff
 on
 the
 earnings
 call
 that


wasn't
 the
 best
 to
 say
 in
 terms
 of
 the


OpenAI
 partnership.
 So
 that's
 why
 it


went
 down
 12%.
 We'll
 recap
 that.
 But


what
 realistically
 happened
 is
 that


Oracle
 apparently
 uh
 they
 didn't


announce
 this
 but
 some
 media
 brand
 came


out.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 Bloomberg
 that
 said


uh
 Oracle
 and
 OpenAI
 are
 delaying
 the


data
 centers
 that
 they
 had
 ready
 to


start
 for
 2026.
 Now
 Oracle
 came
 out
 and


said
 there
 was
 no
 plan
 for
 2026.
 we
 are


online
 with
 whatever
 expectations
 that


we
 were
 supposed
 to
 have.
 All
 milestones


are
 still
 in
 track.
 And
 then
 they
 said


if
 there
 were
 any
 like
 logistical


concerns,
 it
 would
 be
 about
 labor
 and


material,
 which
 is
 a
 sort
 of
 like
 a


I
 guess
 you
 could
 say
 a
 supply
 concern


because
 labor
 and
 material,
 you
 know,


that's
 that's
 part
 of
 the
 supply
 to
 be


able
 to
 build
 out
 a
 data
 center,
 aka
 the


jobs
 and
 the
 actual
 infrastructure


needed
 to
 put
 a
 data
 center
 online,
 not


demand.
 So
 Oracle
 said,
 "Our
 delivery


timelines
 are
 fine.
 There's
 no
 delays.


All
 milestones
 are
 on
 track.
 And
 if


there
 is
 any
 issues,
 it
 has
 to
 do
 with


supply,
 not
 demand.
 Market
 didn't
 care.


Market
 didn't
 care.
 Uh
 market
 still


ended
 up
 going
 pretty
 red.
 And
 and
 and


the
 the
 problem
 with
 kind
 of
 that


headline
 is
 it
 once
 again
 brought
 into


question.
 Here's
 the
 futures
 right
 here


going
 green.
 The
 nature
 of
 this
 AI


bubble.
 So
 I
 think
 futures
 going
 green


right
 here
 and
 maybe
 opening
 green


tomorrow
 if
 we
 can
 continue
 this


momentum
 is
 a
 potential
 reversal
 of
 the


downside
 that
 we
 had
 on
 Friday,
 which


absolutely
 was
 annoying.
 I
 think
 it
 kind


of
 just
 whipsawed
 all
 of
 us
 as
 well.


Like
 that
 was
 the
 annoying
 part
 because


we
 hit
 all-time
 highs
 on
 Thursday
 after


hours.
 Now
 maybe
 we
 hit
 alltime
 highs


because
 Broadcom
 was
 pumping
 and
 then


Broadcom
 ended
 up
 dumping
 so
 things


ended
 up
 reversing.
 But
 to
 kind
 of
 get


the
 Nvidia
 to
 go
 from
 190
 to
 175
 within


24
 hours,
 that
 was
 pretty
 annoying.
 You


know,
 Hood
 135
 to
 119.
 That
 was


annoying.
 Iran
 got
 hit
 from
 47
 back
 to


40.
 Closed
 9
 cents
 above
 40.
 Google
 down


to
 309
 because
 Broadcom
 fell.
 Amcore
 47


to
 44.
 Amazon
 232
 to
 226.
 Tesla's


ironically
 the
 only
 one
 that
 held
 up
 and


we
 do
 have
 some
 Tesla
 headlines
 over
 the


weekend
 so
 we'll
 talk
 about
 that.
 It


looks
 like
 the
 robo
 taxis
 without
 a


driver
 are
 starting
 to
 be
 seen
 in


Austin.
 Uh
 but
 obviously
 everything
 else


got
 hit.
 So
 uh
 the
 question
 now
 is
 how


much
 of
 that
 Oracle
 open
 AI
 headline


does
 the
 market
 actually
 care
 about?
 Is


it
 a
 larger
 concern
 around
 data
 center


buildout?
 Is
 the
 AI
 trade
 just
 getting


exhausted
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year?


Or
 do
 we
 rally?
 Do
 we
 really
 rally


towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year?
 Can
 we
 get


this
 Santa
 Claus
 rally?
 Can
 we
 get


momentum?
 Can
 we
 get
 fund
 managers
 that


want
 to
 buy
 in
 as
 they
 get
 towards
 the


end
 of the
 year?
 And
 do
 we
 make
 a
 run


for
 7,000?
 And
 which
 honestly
 we
 should


do
 a
 poll
 right
 here
 in
 the
 chat,
 see


kind
 of
 how
 people
 are
 thinking.
 I'm


honestly
 5050.
 I
 want
 to
 say
 yes,
 we


have
 that
 end
 of
 year
 run.
 Uh
 but
 then


you
 just
 look
 at
 the
 fragility
 of
 the


stock
 market
 when
 this
 honestly
 BS


headline
 around
 OpenAI
 and
 Oracle
 comes


out
 and
 everything
 just
 takes
 a
 hit.


Like
 it's
 one
 of
 those
 things
 where
 it's


like,
 well,
 we're
 not
 necessarily
 at
 630


on
 the
 S&P.
 We're
 at
 681.
 We're


basically
 what
 1.2%
 away
 from
 alltime


highs.
 That's
 not
 insanity
 for
 the
 world


for
 for
 for
 the
 market
 to
 close
 at
 that


level
 towards
 the
 end
 of the
 year
 or


even
 close
 to
 like
 685
 or
 something.


Like
 that's
 a
 17%
 year
 on
 the
 S&P.
 You


got
 to
 take
 that.
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people


are
 expecting
 that
 7,000
 or
 at least


that
 695,
 that
 20%
 backto-back
 year,


which
 would
 be
 incredible.
 Uh
 but
 but


the
 market
 is
 fragile.
 And
 so
 if
 we
 get


another
 one
 of
 these
 stupid
 headlines


towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year,
 that
 might


stop
 us
 from
 from
 getting
 there.
 So
 end


of
 year
 rally,
 yes
 or
 no?
 Uh
 or
 I
 should


put
 yes,
 no,
 or
 flat,


aka
 no
 would
 mean
 we
 end
 the
 year
 red


from
 these
 levels.
 So
 call
 it
 681
 and


below.
 Uh
 yes
 means
 probably
 make
 a
 run


to
 that
 690
 level.
 Flat
 means
 we
 stay


681
 to
 685.
 Nothing
 too
 crazy
 in
 terms


of
 run
 on
 the
 S&P


which
 right
 now,
 you
 know,
 we
 got
 a
 lot


of
 updates
 this
 week
 in
 terms
 of


different
 headlines
 coming
 out.
 So


hopefully
 those
 headlines
 will
 be
 more


bullish
 than
 not
 in
 terms
 of
 CPI,
 jobs,


etc.
 We
 did
 get
 the
 most
 bullish
 rate


cut
 or
 I
 should
 say
 dobish
 rate
 cut
 that


we've
 gotten
 in
 history
 or
 not
 in


history,
 but
 at least
 in
 2025.
 I
 mean,


you
 did
 not
 have
 Powell
 being
 as
 dovish


as
 he
 was
 outside
 of
 Wednesday.
 And
 even


that
 wasn't
 enough
 because
 of
 the


market's
 concerns
 about
 the
 AI


headlines.


And
 so
 I
 think
 starting
 tomorrow
 we'll


at least
 get
 to
 see
 how
 this
 ends
 up


playing
 out.
 Yes,
 tax
 loss
 harvesting
 is


probably
 already
 a
 thing.
 People
 have


probably
 already
 started
 that.
 Um
 I


don't
 know
 if
 it's
 going to
 be
 that
 much


of
 a
 concern
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.
 I
 think
 realistically
 the
 concern


now
 towards
 the
 end
 of the
 year
 is
 the


AI
 trade.
 And
 we'll
 talk
 more
 about
 it.


We
 got
 three
 minutes
 until
 the
 overnight


markets
 open,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 has


to
 do
 with
 the
 Fed
 anymore.
 I
 don't


think
 it
 has
 to
 do
 with
 liquidity.
 Maybe


it
 has
 to
 do
 with
 shutdown
 concerns


coming
 back.
 Maybe
 it
 has
 to
 do
 with


health
 care
 subsidies
 being


realistically
 I
 think
 in
 the
 next
 15


days
 the
 market
 has
 to
 ask
 itself.
 Um
 do


we
 think
 AI
 deserves
 a
 continued
 premium


which
 again
 Nvidia
 is
 still
 up
 30%
 year


to
 date.
 Google's
 still
 up
 60%
 year.


It's
 not
 like
 these
 stocks
 have


collapsed.
 It's
 just
 they're
 not
 trading


at
 those
 levels
 that
 they
 were
 trading


at
 even
 a
 week
 ago


as
 as
 you
 know
 we
 thought
 a
 lot
 of
 them


would
 towards
 the
 end
 of the
 year.


Nvidia
 being
 below
 190
 is
 kind
 of
 crazy


to
 me.
 Google
 at
 308,
 not
 that
 crazy.


Amazon
 at
 226
 kind
 of
 crazy.
 So,


next
 two
 weeks
 are
 going
 to
 really


define
 how
 this
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.


Thoughts
 on
 BMR?
 Unfortunately,
 ETH
 got


hit
 pretty
 bad
 uh
 with
 the
 Oracle


headline.
 Uh
 and
 Bitcoin
 getting
 a


little
 green
 candle
 right
 there.
 882
 to


88.
 Oh,
 we
 hit
 876.
 Wow.
 I
 didn't
 even


see
 that.
 Yeah,
 around
 630
 we
 hit
 876.


Now
 up
 to
 885.
 Yeah,
 ETH
 getting
 hit


over
 the
 weekend
 with
 Bitcoin.
 I
 mean,


every
 Sunday
 it's
 felt
 like
 Bitcoin
 and


Ethereum.
 Something
 happened.
 Someone


got
 liquidated,
 some
 some
 glitch


happened,
 but
 it's
 and
 I
 know
 Sundays


are
 always
 volatile
 for
 crypto
 because


it's
 potentially
 low
 volume
 that
 affects


it,
 but
 the
 past
 couple
 Sundays
 have


been
 pretty
 I
 mean,
 last
 Sunday
 we
 went


from
 94
 to
 89,
 which
 is
 very
 annoying.


But
 here
 we
 are
 at
 88.5


and
 we're
 going to
 see
 where
 that
 plays


out
 going
 to
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.


Japanese
 bonds
 are
 down
 a
 little
 bit.


Okay.
 1.945
 on
 the
 10-year.
 The
 10-year


bond
 has
 not
 been
 the
 biggest
 issue.
 I


know
 the
 Japanese
 are
 going
 to
 be


cutting
 rates
 pretty
 soon
 or
 sorry,


raising
 rates
 pretty
 soon.
 I
 think


that's
 kind
 of
 baked
 in.
 So,
 that


decision
 will
 get
 this
 Friday.
 Um,
 but


the
 Japanese
 tenure
 was
 not
 the
 problem


last
 week.
 The
 tenure
 in
 the
 United


States
 wasn't
 the
 problem.
 I
 think
 the


problem
 was
 just
 the
 fear
 of
 the
 AI


trade.
 And
 now
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to


see
 going
 into
 next
 week
 if
 the
 market


continues
 to
 be
 afraid
 of
 that
 trade.


All
 right,
 here
 we
 go.
 Sunday,
 December


14th,
 8:00
 PM.
 Thank
 everybody
 for
 being


here.
 The
 overnight
 markets
 are
 now


indeed
 open
 and
 let's
 see
 how
 we
 open


up.
 S&P
 500
 up.16%
 at
 682.
 Oaklow
 that's


up
 half
 a
 percent.
 Broadcom
 continues


down.
 Wow.


Street
 is
 not
 happy
 with
 Broadcom.
 We'll


talk
 more
 about
 that.
 359
 that's
 still


red.
 AMD
 is
 down
 about.32%.
 Nvidia
 is
 up


a
 little
 bit
 39%.
 Rivian
 which
 had
 a


massive
 day
 on
 Friday
 up
 12%.
 That's
 up


1.63%.
 I
 Ren,
 that's
 down
 1%.
 Google,


that's
 down6%.
 Ampor,
 that's
 down
 1%.


Tesla
 is
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 Tesla's


actually
 up43%.
 Rocket
 Lab,
 that's
 flat,


0.02.
 Oh,
 by
 the
 way,
 SpaceX
 officially


IPOing.
 We'll
 talk
 a
 lot
 about
 that
 in
 a


second,
 but
 SpaceX
 will
 be
 going
 IPO.


Robin
 Hood,
 that's
 down
 about
 30
 cents.


Palanteer,
 that's
 down
 81
 cents,
 18276.


Roblox
 is
 up
 a
 little bit.
 You
 have


Andos,
 that's
 down
 half
 a
 percent.
 VG,


which
 doesn't
 trade
 after
 hours,
 but
 it


or
 it
 doesn't
 trade
 overnight,
 but
 it


did
 trade
 after
 hours.
 That's
 up
 a


little
 bit.
 Netflix,
 that's
 flat.
 SoFi,


that's
 down
 half
 a
 percent.
 Interesting.


S&P
 futures
 are
 up,
 and
 the
 S&P
 is
 up,


but
 a
 lot
 of
 stocks
 in
 the
 S&P
 are
 down,


which
 is
 pretty
 ugly.
 Amazon
 right


there,
 22630,
 that's
 uh
 0.05%.
 Broadcom,


that's
 down44%.
 AMD
 down.35%.
 BMR,
 is


that
 one
 dumping?
 BMR
 is
 indeed
 dumping.


That's
 down
 half
 a
 percent.
 S&P
 that's


up
 a
 little
 bit.
 Amazon
 up
 a
 little
 bit.


Apple,
 we
 closed,
 I
 think,
 green
 on


Friday.
 Yeah,
 Apple
 was
 one
 of
 the
 only


stocks
 that
 was
 green
 in
 the
 MAX
 7278.


That's
 down
 another
 0.25%.
 What's
 green


then?
 Why
 is
 the
 S&P
 green?
 Everything


else
 seems
 red?


Lily?
 Is
 Lily
 up?
 Okay,
 Lily
 is
 your


answer.
 JP
 Morgan,
 is
 JP
 Morgan
 up?
 JP


Morgan
 is
 your
 answer.
 Goldman
 Sachs,


Goldman
 Sachs
 is
 up.
 The
 banks,
 the


financials,
 and
 the
 healthc
 care
 names


are
 green.


Uh,
 is
 UNH
 green?
 Everything
 else
 is
 red


and
 that's
 propping
 up
 the
 S&P.
 Yep,


even
 UNH
 is
 green.
 All right,
 so
 tech


goes
 red
 again
 as
 we
 saw
 pretty
 much
 on


Friday.
 However,
 S&P
 is
 holding
 green
 as


I
 guess
 even
 in
 the
 overnight
 markets,


the
 rotation
 to
 financials
 and


healthcare.
 At least
 those
 are
 the
 two


is
 Walmart.
 Dude,
 Walmart
 had
 one
 of
 its


best
 weeks
 ever
 last
 week
 and
 I
 don't


even
 think
 I
 talked
 about
 it.
 Completely


missed
 my
 radar.
 Walmart's
 flat
 after


hours,
 but
 Walmart
 was
 up
 1%
 on
 Friday


when
 the
 entire
 market
 was
 down.


Nvidia
 is
 green
 a
 little
 bit.
 50
 cents.


I
 don't
 know if
 it's
 enough
 green
 to


prop
 up
 the
 entire
 S&P,
 but
 that
 is


correct.
 Nvidia
 is
 green.
 And
 then
 Tesla


is
 also
 Tesla's
 actually
 decently
 green.


Tesla's
 up
 like
 Whoa,
 Tesla's
 up
 3%.
 No,


Tesla's
 green.
 Green.


Yeah,
 there
 you
 go.
 462


on
 Tessy.


Okay,
 so
 Tesla
 and
 Amazon
 and
 Nvidia.


Amazon
 and
 Nvidia
 are
 slightly
 green.


Tesla's
 really
 green.
 Everything
 else,


Amazon
 just
 went
 red.
 No,
 Amazon's


slightly
 green.
 It
 went
 down
 1.6,
 now


it's
 up
 7.
 Did
 the
 S&P
 just
 go
 red?


Yeah,
 the
 S&P
 just
 went
 red.
 68278.
 Am
 I


bugging
 or
 is
 that
 Hold
 on.
 Let
 me
 check


on
 Robin
 Hood.


S&P
 went


uh
 682.86.


No,
 that's
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 That's
 up
 a


little
 bit.
 We
 both
 sang
 it
 wrong,
 but


that's
 up
 a
 little
 bit.


Okay,
 so
 uh
 let's
 get
 into
 all
 the
 stuff


we
 have
 to
 talk
 about.
 But
 yeah,
 S&P
 is


up
 slightly
 right
 here.
 Amazon's
 up


slightly.
 Nvidia's
 up
 slightly.
 And
 then


Lily
 and
 the
 financials
 are
 the
 ones


that
 are
 really
 Yeah,
 Weeble's


glitching,
 right?
 Weeble's
 glitching
 a


little
 bit.


Some
 of
 these
 stocks
 are
 okay
 on
 Weeble.


The
 other
 ones
 are
 wrong.
 Like
 it
 just


said
 Nvidia
 was
 red,
 then
 Nvidia
 went


green.
 Then
 it
 said
 Tesla
 was
 up
 3%.
 Now


Tesla's
 up
 5%.
 Yeah,
 it's
 a
 little bit


of
 a
 Weeble
 glitch.


Where
 is
 Weeble
 stock,
 by
 the
 way?
 That


stock
 was
 at
 $10
 last
 week.
 That
 stock


918.
 That's
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 after
 hours.


Okay,
 so
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 A
 lot
 of


stuff
 relatively
 flat.
 Wow.
 Iroot
 enters


chapter
 11
 lender
 to
 acquire
 room
 make m


Roomba
 mark
 marker
 or
 maker.
 Uh
 this


stock
 was
 pumping
 throughout
 the


entirety
 of
 the
 week.
 IRBT


it's
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 after
 hours.


Okay.
 Well,
 I
 think
 people
 expected
 this


one
 to
 end
 up
 getting
 hit
 and
 now
 it
 I


mean
 this
 thing
 was
 at
 like
 50
 cents.


So,
 if
 you
 wrote
 it
 up
 to
 like
 $5
 or
 450


or
 whatever,


then
 that's
 been


that's
 been
 okay.
 Yeah.
 Let
 me
 open
 up


Legend.
 Dude,
 Weeble's
 been
 just
 weird.


Completely
 weird.
 Let's
 pull
 up
 a
 couple


of
 these
 stocks
 on
 Legend.
 But
 see,
 on


Legend,
 it
 doesn't
 really
 give
 you


See,
 Legend's
 not
 necessarily
 giving
 you


the
 after
 hours
 moving
 either,
 but
 at


least
 we're
 seeing
 S&P
 right
 there.


68255.
 You
 can
 see
 that,
 right?
 Yeah,


you
 can
 see
 that
 68255.


Okay,
 so
 basically
 flat
 S&P
 68259.


Pounder
 is
 flat.
 Nvidia's
 up
 a
 little


bit
 17540.
 Robin
 Hood
 118.
 Robin
 Hood
 is


indeed
 down.
 That
 one's
 red.
 Uh
 Tesla,


Nvidia
 and
 Apple
 are
 your


Mac
 7s
 that
 are
 green.
 Tesla's
 up
 about


59
 cents
 and
 then
 Nvidia


is
 up
 about
 40
 cents.


That's
 what
 you
 got
 there.
 Is
 rumor


going
 to
 be
 an
 excuse
 tomorrow
 for
 the


sell-off
 potentially?
 I
 think
 people


knew
 Chapter
 11
 was
 coming
 for
 them,
 but


their
 stock
 just
 ended
 up
 continuing
 to


run.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 people
 have
 taken
 that


thing
 again
 from
 like
 a
 dollar
 to
 $4.


So,
 I'm
 not
 sure
 how
 the
 market's
 going


to
 treat
 it
 tomorrow.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look
 at
 this
 thing,
 dude.


This
 thing
 was
 at
 a$1.77.
 Now,
 it's
 at


432.
 It's
 up
 120%
 in
 the
 past
 month.


So,
 not
 sure
 how
 this
 one
 trades,
 but
 I


do
 know
 people
 a
 lot
 of
 volume's
 been


coming
 in
 on
 this
 one.
 Got
 to
 524
 on


December
 10th,
 now
 back
 down
 to
 432,
 up


from
 about
 a
 dollar1.


Rocket
 Lab
 is
 flat,
 but
 Rocket
 Lab
 was


up
 30%
 last
 week,
 so
 people
 can't
 be
 too


mad
 about
 that.
 Rocket
 Lab,
 nope,
 Rocket


Lab's
 green,
 62,
 up
 about
 1%,
 40
 cents


for
 Rocket
 Lab.


All
 right.
 So,
 let's
 get
 into
 um
 all
 the


details
 that
 we've
 got
 going
 on


for
 tomorrow
 and
 kind
 of
 give
 a
 preview


of
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 throughout


this
 entire
 week.
 Again,
 markets


relatively
 flat.
 You
 have
 a
 couple
 of


individual
 names
 that
 are
 green.


Everything
 else
 continuing
 some
 of
 the


red,
 not
 aggressive
 red
 like
 Robin's


down
 50
 cents.
 Pounder's
 down
 36
 cents.


A
 lot
 of
 these
 high
 beta
 names
 are
 down


one
 a
 percent
 or
 two,
 but
 nothing


massive


across
 the
 board.
 Seagate
 Technology


Holdings
 to
 be
 added
 to
 the
 NASDAQ
 100,


Western
 Digital
 to
 be
 added
 to
 the


NASDAQ
 100.
 STX
 and
 WDC.
 Okay,
 let's
 see


if
 that's
 having
 any
 impact
 on
 those


stocks
 if
 they
 trade
 overnight.
 STX,


that's
 up
 about
 1%.
 Western
 Digital,


which
 has
 been
 a
 phenomenal
 uh
 stock


this
 year
 in
 terms
 of
 return,
 that
 one's


up
 about.37%.


Okay,
 makes
 sense
 that
 they're


transitioning
 to
 the
 NASDAQ
 100
 as
 well.


All right,
 so
 um
 let's
 get
 into
 it
 and


let's
 talk
 about
 some
 of
 the
 stuff
 we


have
 for
 this
 week.
 So
 again,
 last
 week


was
 the
 the
 biggest
 headline
 that
 we
 had


on
 Friday
 was
 the
 Oracles
 news
 in


regards
 to
 the
 data
 center
 stuff.
 uh
 got


another
 update
 today
 which
 continues
 to


go
 in
 track
 with
 what
 we
 are
 hearing


from
 Oracle
 which
 is
 that
 Oracle
 is
 now


adding
 150
 billion
 in
 new
 data
 center


lease
 commitments
 in
 Q2.
 The
 total
 lease


commitments
 have
 reached
 248
 billion
 as


of
 November
 30th
 so
 pretty
 much
 towards


the
 end
 of
 or
 the
 middle
 of
 Q4.
 Lease


deals
 are
 primarily
 tied
 to
 cloud
 and


data
 center
 expansion
 which
 is
 what
 they


said
 on
 the
 call.
 It's
 supporting


partnerships
 with
 clients
 like
 OpenAI.


Customer
 contract
 commitments
 hit
 523


billion.
 That's
 their
 RPO
 number.
 Oracle


expects
 10%
 of
 contracts
 recognized
 in


the
 next
 12
 months
 and
 another
 65%
 of


revenue
 to
 be
 recognized
 over
 the
 next


five
 years.
 So
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 stuff
 is


relatively
 bullish
 around
 the
 data


center
 releases
 that
 Oracle
 has
 been


going
 after
 and
 none
 of
 this
 stuff
 is


necessarily
 inconsistent
 with
 what
 we


heard
 on
 earnings.
 What
 it
 is


inconsistent
 with
 is
 the
 delays
 that


were
 the
 headline
 that
 captivated
 the


entire
 markets
 on
 Friday.
 And
 um


unfortunately,
 you
 know,
 that
 stuff
 took


the
 market
 down.
 But
 again,
 it
 just


doesn't
 seem
 as
 real
 as
 how
 the
 market


kind
 of
 kind
 of
 priced
 in,
 especially


when
 you're
 talking
 about
 150
 billion
 of


leases
 in
 the
 Oracle
 data
 center


ecosystem.
 Again,
 Oracle
 said
 site


selection
 and
 delivery
 timelines
 for


OpenAI
 data
 centers
 were
 set
 jointly


with
 OpenAI.
 No
 delays
 to
 any
 sites
 and


all
 milestones
 are
 still
 on
 track.


Market
 recovered
 a
 little
 bit
 then
 kind


of
 gave
 back
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 gains.
 So


we're
 not
 really
 seeing
 any
 recovery
 in


the
 overnight
 markets.
 Tomorrow
 I
 guess


when
 we
 get
 more
 volume
 we'll
 see
 if


there
 is
 any
 recovery
 but
 that
 news
 from


open
 eye
 is
 not
 necessarily
 bearish.


IPOs
 SpaceX
 so
 SpaceX
 has
 started
 the


process
 of
 fielding
 Wall
 Street
 banks


for
 a
 potential
 IPO.
 This
 is
 reported
 by


the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 uh
 today.
 On
 top


of
 that,
 SpaceX
 yesterday
 completed
 its


tender
 offer
 at
 a
 $800
 billion
 valuation


at
 a
 $421


share
 price,
 which
 is
 ironic
 at
 421,
 but


nonetheless,
 it
 is
 $421.
 The
 tender


offered
 allowed
 employees
 to
 sell
 their


shares,
 and
 SpaceX
 did
 not
 necessarily


raise
 money
 from
 the
 transaction.
 So,


the
 question
 now
 becomes
 when
 are
 they


going
 public?
 How
 are
 they
 going
 to
 go


public?
 At
 what
 valuation
 are
 they
 going


to
 go
 public?
 Um,
 you
 know,
 they're


they're
 completing
 a
 tender
 offer
 at
 800


billion,
 but
 is
 it
 actually
 going
 to
 be


800
 billion?
 Is
 it
 going to
 be
 more
 than


800
 billion?
 And
 does
 this
 thing
 double


in
 a
 day
 as
 soon
 as
 it
 goes
 public?
 I'm


a
 bit
 skeptical
 on
 the
 SpaceX
 IPO,
 and


800
 billion,
 I'm
 sorry,
 I'm
 just
 not


buying
 it.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 lot
 of


hype
 baked
 into
 them
 going
 public
 based


on
 their
 financials.
 Now,
 is
 there
 a


story
 that's
 probably
 better
 than
 most


stocks
 in
 the
 market?
 Yes.
 Will
 the
 IPO


do
 well?
 Yes.
 But
 I
 feel
 like
 if
 you


can't
 get
 in
 early
 on
 this,
 the
 best
 way


to
 play
 this
 is
 Rocket
 Lab.
 Like,
 is


Rocket
 Lab
 a
 bit
 expensive
 at
 a
 $32


billion
 market
 cap?
 Sure.
 But
 I'd
 rather


pay
 that
 than
 800
 billion
 on
 SpaceX,


which
 you're
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 get


it
 at
 800
 billion
 unless
 you
 have
 a


connection.
 You're
 probably
 going
 to


have
 to
 get
 it
 at
 850
 or
 900
 billion
 in


the
 uh
 public
 markets
 when
 it
 opens
 up.


Uh
 or
 even
 if
 you
 go
 through
 an
 SPV,


they're
 probably
 going
 to
 charge
 you
 a


premium.
 They're
 not
 going
 to
 give
 you
 a


juicy
 $800
 billion
 valuation
 because


that's
 where
 the
 employees
 got
 to
 exit.


So,
 they're
 going
 to
 charge
 a
 fee
 on
 top


of
 the
 employees
 and
 you're
 going
 to


probably
 have
 to
 pay
 850
 to
 900
 billion


just
 to
 get
 access
 to
 it.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 if


you're
 trying
 to
 get
 access
 to
 SpaceX
 in


the
 private
 markets
 just
 to
 dump
 it
 when


it
 goes
 public,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's


the
 best
 risk-to-reward.
 I
 mean,
 it's


not
 like
 you're
 getting
 a
 10x
 that
 you


can
 dump.
 The
 10x
 was
 years
 ago,
 not


today.
 So,
 look,
 I
 don't
 love
 Rocket


Labs
 valuation.
 I've
 been
 saying
 this


since
 75.
 I've
 been
 long
 Rocket
 Labs


since
 25.
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 phenomenal


company.
 But
 if
 I
 had
 to
 play
 space
 and


I
 wanted
 to
 get
 access
 to
 that


ecosystem,
 it'd
 be
 Rocket
 Lab
 or
 AS.
 It


would
 not
 be
 like
 salivating
 for
 a


SpaceX
 IPO
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


going
 to
 get
 into.
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 if


the
 valuation
 there
 makes
 any
 sense
 at


all.
 Now,
 they're
 going
 to
 raise
 a
 ton


of
 money
 and
 that
 money
 is,
 you
 know,


going
 to
 be
 instrumental
 for
 them
 and


they're
 going
 to
 really
 have
 to
 pump


this
 data
 center
 and
 space
 argument


because
 Starlink
 is
 amazing,
 but


Starlink
 is
 not
 enough
 for
 it
 to,
 you


know,
 be
 justified
 at
 the
 valuation
 that


it's
 justified.
 and
 $14
 billion
 this


company
 does
 in
 revenue.
 So,
 as
 much
 as


I
 love
 Elon
 and
 SpaceX,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


think
 I'm
 going to
 be
 a
 buyer
 of
 that.


And
 even
 if
 I
 wanted
 to
 be
 a
 buyer,


there's
 no
 way
 retail
 I
 mean,
 the
 amount


of
 people
 that
 are
 going to
 be
 try
 to


get
 access
 to
 it
 on
 Robin
 Hood.
 Like,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 I
 think
 quite


impossible
 to
 get
 a
 meaningful
 level
 of


exposure
 to
 it
 without
 having
 to
 pay
 a


heavy
 hefty
 premium.
 So,


yeah,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 this
 plays


out.
 Now,
 the
 other
 thing
 about
 SpaceX


that's
 also
 interesting
 is
 that
 if
 they


do
 IPO
 and
 go
 public,
 the
 question
 is


how
 much
 can
 the
 valuation
 be
 supported?


Because
 I
 mean,
 we've
 seen
 this
 with


Tesla
 before,
 right?
 Tesla
 pumps
 up
 and


then
 Tesla
 gets
 dumped.
 I
 mean,
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 retail
 that's
 going
 to
 be


interested.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 many
 people


are
 going
 to
 necessarily
 have
 diamond


hands.
 You're
 going to
 have
 a
 lot
 of


institutions
 that
 are
 going
 to
 be


wanting
 to
 dump
 on
 those
 people
 that


supposedly
 have
 diamond
 hands.
 So,
 it's


one
 of
 those
 things
 where
 it's
 like
 same


thing
 with
 the
 data
 bricks
 IPO.
 A
 lot
 of


these
 companies
 that
 go
 public,
 they
 are


obviously
 looking
 for
 exit
 liquidity.


SpaceX
 has
 been
 the
 most
 coveted
 startup


in
 a
 very
 long
 time.
 And
 I
 just
 don't


know
 if
 I
 want
 to
 be
 part
 of
 the
 retail


investor
 community
 that
 is
 exit


liquidity.
 But
 I
 mean,
 if
 this
 thing


pumps
 double
 in
 a
 day
 and
 goes
 to
 1.5


trillion
 immediately,
 then
 we've
 got
 a


pretty
 liquid
 market.
 And
 with
 rates


coming
 down,
 more
 money
 entering
 into


the
 ecosystem,
 not
 crazy
 to
 imagine
 that


that
 also
 could
 end
 up
 playing
 out.


Speaking
 of
 Elon,
 Tesla.
 So
 the
 big
 news


over
 the
 weekend
 for
 Tesla,
 which
 quite


frankly
 happened
 this
 morning.
 Um,
 shout


out
 to
 our
 boy
 Mr.
 Sawyer
 Merritt
 who


posted
 this
 rock
 lab
 is
 well
 up
 about
 2%


in
 the
 pre-markets
 probably
 on
 this
 um


SpaceX
 news
 is
 there
 you
 go
 there's
 a


Tesla
 Model
 Y
 robo
 taxi
 no
 one
 is
 in
 the


car
 in
 Austin
 Texas
 and
 this
 has
 been


confirmed
 by
 multiple
 Tesla
 employees


that
 officially


this
 has
 gone
 live


in
 the
 state
 of
 Texas
 in
 the
 city
 of


Austin
 and
 then
 they
 found
 a
 second
 one


as
 well
 so
 there's
 the
 second
 one
 right


This
 is
 a
 different
 car
 from
 the
 one


spotted
 earlier.
 They
 have
 different


license
 plates
 and
 no
 one
 is
 in
 the


front
 seats.


Rockab
 4%.
 I
 I
 really
 do
 think
 Rocket


Lab
 is
 the
 way
 that
 people
 are
 going
 to


play
 the
 SpaceX
 IPO.


And
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 Rocket
 Lab
 is
 the


cheapest
 stock
 in
 the
 market.
 It
 just


means
 that
 thematically
 this
 is
 going
 to


get
 some
 love.
 But
 the
 reason
 Tesla
 is


up
 right
 now
 is
 because
 I
 think
 the


market's
 pretty
 excited
 that
 Wait
 a


second.
 this
 robo
 taxi
 stuff
 that
 Elon's


been
 talking
 about
 FSD
 14.2,
 which
 in
 my


anecdotal
 experience
 has
 been


phenomenal,
 is
 starting
 to
 now
 get
 on


the
 roads
 without
 needing
 supervision.
 I


mean,
 even
 in
 uh
 my
 experience
 with
 it,


I'm
 able
 to
 be
 on
 my
 phone.
 It
 doesn't


nag
 me
 as
 much.
 Like,
 you
 can
 just
 tell


it's
 getting
 friendlier
 to
 where
 it's


not
 necessarily
 always
 having
 your


attention
 looking
 at
 the
 road.
 You
 can


look
 out
 the
 window
 for
 a
 little
 bit
 and


enjoy
 the
 view
 without
 it
 constantly


saying,
 "Hey,
 pay
 attention
 to
 the


road."
 So,
 we're
 getting
 to
 the
 point


where
 the
 car
 should
 be
 able
 to
 drive


itself.
 We
 know
 Whimo
 has
 completed
 14


million
 rides
 this
 year
 and
 we
 had
 some


really
 big
 Whimo
 announcements
 last
 week


which
 is
 why
 Uber
 ended
 up
 taking
 a
 5%


hit
 for
 the
 week.
 Uber
 right
 there
 at


85.
 That
 one's
 down
 again
 in
 the


overnight
 markets.
 But
 if
 Tesla
 could


finally
 get
 to
 the
 point
 where
 they
 can


pick
 people
 up
 and
 put
 them
 in
 their


destination
 without
 needing
 a
 driver
 in


the
 car.
 I
 mean
 the
 manifestation
 of


what
 everyone's
 been
 waiting
 for
 might


start
 to
 take
 place.
 So
 I
 think
 that's


why
 Tesla's
 up
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 why


the
 market


is
 relatively
 excited
 for
 this.


as
 well.
 I
 saw
 a
 Whimo
 car
 being
 tested


in
 London.
 Yeah.
 So,
 uh
 Google
 did
 say


that
 London
 and
 um
 Tokyo
 are
 the
 next


two
 major
 cities.
 They're
 expanding
 to


20
 cities.
 Rocket
 Lab
 did
 have
 a


successful
 launch
 in
 Japan.
 That
 is


correct.
 That
 happened
 yesterday,
 right?


I
 think
 that
 was
 yesterday.
 So,
 that


either
 that
 was
 yesterday
 or
 Friday


night.
 Um
 no,
 no,
 I
 think
 it
 was


yesterday
 during
 the
 day.
 But
 that


that's
 another
 reason
 why
 Rock
 Labs
 up.


Uh,
 but
 Google
 wants
 20
 cities
 and
 a


million
 paid
 rides
 by
 the
 end
 uh
 of
 2026


per
 week,
 which
 would
 be
 52
 million


rides.
 Uh,
 which
 would
 be
 essentially
 a


tripling
 of
 paid
 rides
 from
 last
 year
 or


from
 from
 2025.


So
 Tesla's
 nowhere
 near
 that
 scale
 yet


because
 they
 don't
 have
 the
 amount
 of


vehicles
 needed
 to
 be
 getting
 to
 that


scale
 on
 the
 roads.
 But,
 you
 know,


eventually
 if
 they
 get
 there,
 that
 would


be
 very
 exciting
 for
 Tesla.
 So,
 that's


why
 Tesla's
 given
 a
 move.
 And,
 you
 know,


that
 that
 that
 uh
 AI
 regulatory


framework
 that
 Trump
 signed
 from
 a


executive
 order
 perspective
 about
 how


there
 should
 be
 one
 ecosystem
 for
 AI


even
 though
 different
 states
 can
 have


different
 bylaws.
 It
 all
 has
 to
 live
 up


to
 one
 federal
 standard.
 Uh,
 that's


super
 bullish
 for
 FSD
 and
 unsupervised


driving
 so
 that
 Tesla
 doesn't
 have
 to
 go


to
 every
 single
 state
 and
 get
 approval.


And
 I'm
 sure
 there's
 still
 going to
 be


the
 minutia
 of
 how
 they
 get
 it
 approved


everywhere.
 But
 if
 you
 have
 something


like
 that,
 I
 kind
 of
 think
 that's
 why


Tesla
 pumped
 on
 Friday,
 that
 would
 be


like
 very
 beneficial
 to
 Tesla
 in


particular
 because
 they
 have
 laws
 that


need
 to
 be
 governed
 in
 FSD
 universally.


So,
 it
 seems
 like
 that
 would
 be
 that


would
 be
 a
 good
 deal.
 Uh
 Josh,
 thank
 you


for
 the
 $50
 super
 chat.
 No
 lies
 detected


on
 Rocket
 Lab.
 Yeah.
 Uh
 Josh
 had
 a
 great


Substack
 on
 Rocket
 Lab
 that
 I
 read
 over


the
 weekend
 as
 well.
 I
 think
 the


Rockolap
 thesis
 is
 very
 very
 sound.
 I


don't
 think
 that
 Rocklap
 thesis
 is
 going


anywhere.
 Um,
 it's
 just
 expensive
 in
 my


opinion.
 You're
 paying
 40
 times
 sales


for
 this
 company.
 It's
 a
 bit
 expensive.


Now,
 they
 are
 close
 to
 profitability,


but
 expensive
 gets
 thrown
 out
 the
 window


if
 there's
 a
 narrative
 and
 one
 I
 mean


like
 essentially
 this
 happened
 with


Pounder,
 right?
 Pounder
 has
 always
 been


expensive,
 but
 the
 narrative
 that


software
 and
 AI
 were
 going
 to
 converge.


Pounder
 ended
 up
 being
 the
 only
 company


that
 was
 growing,
 profitable,
 and


investors
 could
 play
 retail
 or


institutional
 as
 a
 thematic
 for
 software


and
 AI.
 So,
 Pounder
 ended
 up
 getting
 the


bid.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 could
 easily


happen
 to
 Rocket
 Lab
 if
 this
 space
 thing


becomes
 even
 bigger
 than
 what
 we


imagined
 because
 of
 that
 SpaceX
 IPO.
 And


that
 might
 be
 an
 easier
 way
 to
 play
 the


entire
 uh
 the
 space
 trend.


So,
 that's
 what
 we
 have
 on
 Rocklab
 and


Tesla
 and
 the
 SpaceX
 IPO.
 And
 hopefully


that
 ends
 up
 happening
 as
 we
 get
 earlier


into
 2026.


Uh
 some
 headlines
 from
 the
 Trump


administration.
 So
 we
 have
 a
 couple


clips
 right
 here.
 Trump
 was
 speaking
 at


a
 crypt
 uh
 at
 a
 uh
 Christmas
 reception.


Here's
 a
 couple
 of
 things
 that
 he
 said


about
 the
 state
 of
 the
 economy
 and
 then


we'll
 talk
 about
 what
 he's
 thinking


about
 for
 the
 Fed
 going
 into
 next
 year.


>> Has
 never
 seen.
 And
 I
 just
 look
 so


forward
 to
 the
 results.
 You're
 going
 to


see
 results
 in
 six
 months
 to
 a
 year.
 I


think
 you'll
 see
 results.
 Uh
 we've
 never


had
 anything
 like
 it
 again.
 There's


never
 been
 any
 country.
 China
 wonderful.


I
 have
 a
 great
 relationship
 with


President
 Xi.
 China's
 never
 seen
 it.


Nobody's
 ever
 seen
 it.
 And
 by
 the
 way,


we're
 leading
 in
 AI
 by
 a
 lot.
 AI
 is
 a


big
 deal.
 And
 we're
 leading
 in
 AI
 by
 a


lot.
 And
 the
 big
 problem
 was


electricity.
 But
 I
 allow
 our
 plants,
 in


other
 words,
 all
 of
 these
 geniuses
 that


are
 building
 a
 $60
 billion
 billion
 $60


billion
 plant,
 I
 allow
 them
 to
 build


their
 own
 electric
 capacity
 as
 part
 of


the
 plant
 and
 that
 solved
 the
 problem


with
 the
 old
 grid.
 Be
 has
 never
 seen
 and


I
 just
 look


>> okay.
 So
 that
 was
 Trump
 on
 some
 of
 the


stuff
 with
 the
 grid
 and
 then
 this
 is


what
 he
 said
 about
 inflation.


>> Country,
 the
 worst
 inflation
 in
 the


history
 of
 our
 country.
 Prices
 were
 the


highest
 they
 ever
 were
 and
 what
 we're


doing
 is
 bringing
 them
 down.
 We
 now
 have


inflation
 is
 totally
 neutralized.
 We
 may


get
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 lower.
 You
 don't


want
 to
 get
 it
 too.
 You
 don't
 want


deflation.
 Deflation
 is
 in
 many
 ways


worse
 than
 inflation.
 But
 we
 have
 a


record
 setting.
 We
 have
 more
 people
 on


Friday.
 We
 had
 more
 people
 working
 on


Friday
 than
 at
 any
 time
 in
 the
 history


of
 our
 country.
 Think
 of
 that
 country.


The
 worst
 inflation.
 So,
 we,
 you
 know,


we've
 been
 talking
 a
 lot
 about
 this


affordability
 narrative
 and
 what
 that


affordability
 narrative
 is
 going
 to
 do


towards
 the
 midterms.
 Uh,
 this
 is
 the


Secretary
 of
 Energy
 this
 morning


discussing
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 energy


bills.
 Again,
 data
 centers
 are
 ramping


up
 those
 energy
 bills
 dramatically.


We've
 seen
 evidence
 of
 that
 in
 Dallas


and
 Oregon.
 Here's
 what
 he
 had
 to
 say.


Again,
 I
 think
 it's
 going to
 be
 one
 of


the
 prevailing
 narratives
 going
 into
 the


midterms
 around
 affordability.


Oh,
 one
 second.
 Let
 me
 reload
 it.
 Okay.


>> With
 the
 president
 talking
 about


affordability
 and
 part
 of
 the
 refrain


was
 that
 uh
 Biden's
 quote
 four-year


allout
 war
 on
 energy
 was
 a
 major
 driver


of
 inflation.
 And
 the
 administration's


been
 pointing
 out
 that
 blue
 states
 uh


energy
 costs
 have
 been
 skewing
 the


national
 average.
 But
 it's
 not
 like
 the


costs
 for
 electricity
 are
 down
 in
 red


states
 either.
 The
 president's
 coming
 up


on
 a
 year
 in
 office.
 When
 can
 Americans


expect
 to
 see
 their
 energy
 bills
 drop?


>> First
 of
 all,
 you
 should
 start
 with


gasoline
 prices.
 On
 inflationadjusted


measures,
 gasoline
 prices
 are
 the
 lowest


they've
 been
 in
 20
 years
 except
 during
 a


blip
 during
 CO.
 So,
 I
 think
 President


Trump's
 policies
 of
 pro-
 energy,
 energy


addition
 versus
 energy
 subtraction
 of


the
 Biden
 administration
 have
 been


immediately
 effective
 in
 gasoline,
 in


diesel,
 in
 other
 fuels.
 But
 the


electricity
 sector
 is
 a
 big
 complicated


machine
 that
 for
 four
 years
 the
 Biden


administration
 shut
 down
 coal
 plants,


shut
 down
 natural
 gas
 plants.
 Heck,
 I


was
 just
 out
 in
 Washington
 state.
 They


were
 going
 to
 dismantle
 four
 hydroelect


electric
 dams.
 So,
 we've
 stopped
 digging


the
 hole.
 We've
 stopped
 the
 closure
 of


coal
 plants.
 You'll
 hear
 more
 on
 that


later
 this
 week.
 And
 so,
 we're
 doing


everything
 we
 can
 to
 stop
 that
 rise
 in


electricity
 prices
 that
 was
 driven
 by


Biden
 policies.
 And
 yes,
 there's
 inertia


that
 continues
 on.
 But
 very
 soon,
 you'll


see
 a
 stop
 of
 the
 rise
 of
 electricity


prices.
 And
 with
 the
 continuation
 of


Trump
 policies
 of
 energy
 addition,
 you


will
 see
 declines
 in
 electricity
 prices


later
 this
 term.
 And
 very
 quickly


because
 we're


>> so
 again
 you
 got
 the
 secretary
 of
 energy


saying
 well
 you
 know
 if
 you're
 going
 to


talk
 about
 energy
 you're
 going
 to
 talk


about
 uh
 prices
 going
 higher
 based
 on
 AI


and
 data
 centers
 we
 have
 to
 talk
 about


gas
 prices
 and
 we
 have
 to
 talk
 about
 all


the
 progress
 that
 we've
 made.


Yes,
 that's
 true.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 much


the
 market
 is
 going
 to
 care
 about
 it
 or


at least
 not
 the
 market
 necessarily
 but


the
 American
 people
 going
 into
 the
 end


of
 the
 year
 unless
 they
 see
 a
 meaningful


difference
 in
 in
 prices.
 And
 I
 think,


you
 know,
 Trump
 knows
 this,
 the


administration
 knows
 this.
 I
 think
 this


is
 why
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 very
 uh


peculiar
 on
 making
 sure
 that
 prices
 do


start
 coming
 down.
 And
 we've
 already


seen
 this
 as
 they've
 started
 to
 roll


back
 tariffs
 on
 things
 like
 coffee
 and


bananas.
 The
 the
 sort
 of
 key
 point
 right


here
 that's
 also
 really
 important
 is
 um


and
 I
 was
 talking
 about
 this
 with
 Steve


on
 Friday,
 which
 is
 if
 we
 were
 to
 get
 a


massive
 20%
 decline
 next
 year,
 which


could
 happen.
 Tom
 Lee
 does
 have
 his


thesis
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 down
 20%


and
 then
 get
 back
 up
 to
 7,700
 in
 in


2026.


The
 worst
 thing
 that
 could
 happen
 is


that
 20%
 draw
 down,
 not
 for
 the
 stock


market,
 but
 for
 the
 economy.
 Because
 one


of
 the
 reasons
 this
 the
 economy
 is


somewhat
 elevated
 is
 because
 people
 that


have
 assets
 feel
 like
 they're
 richer


because
 their
 assets
 are
 up
 and
 as
 a


result
 they're
 spending.
 So,
 you
 know,


even
 if
 you
 have
 the
 bottom
 end
 of
 the


consumer
 that's
 not
 doing
 the
 best,
 you


might
 have
 some
 people
 that
 say,
 "Hey,


I'm
 ready
 to
 vote
 for
 this


administration
 because
 my
 asset
 prices


are
 doing
 okay."
 If
 asset
 prices
 go


down,
 that
 could
 be
 reason
 they
 don't


vote
 for
 the
 administration.
 But
 number


two,
 it
 could
 more
 explicitly
 show
 the


exploitation
 of
 the
 low-end
 consumer


because
 the
 high-end
 consumer
 doesn't


subsidize
 the
 economy
 because
 their


portfolios
 are
 down
 probably
 a
 lot
 more


than
 20%.
 If
 the
 S&P
 actually
 falls
 20%,


most
 people
 will
 probably
 be
 down
 30
 to


40%.
 So,
 you
 kind
 of
 can't
 have
 that


happen
 if
 you
 want
 the
 affordab


affordability
 narrative
 to
 be
 strong,


which
 is
 I
 guess
 you
 could
 call
 it
 a


Trump
 put
 on
 the
 market.
 Will
 it
 be


effective?
 I
 don't
 know.
 But
 if
 asset


prices
 get
 hit,
 affordability
 is
 not


necessarily
 going
 to
 be
 the
 best
 either.


Here
 was
 uh
 Kevin
 Hasset
 as
 well
 on
 the


same
 concept
 of
 affordability.


>> So,
 people
 are
 holiday
 shopping.
 They're


aware
 of
 prices.
 The
 president
 said
 this


week
 prices
 are
 coming
 down


tremendously.
 The
 latest
 data
 though


from
 the
 consumer
 price
 index
 up
 3%


year-over-year.
 Personal
 consumption


index
 is
 up
 2.8%
 year-over-year.


>> What
 data
 is
 he
 looking
 at?
 What's
 your


benchmark?


>> Right.
 Well,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 if


you
 saw
 his
 presentation
 in
 Pennsylvania


as
 he
 put
 up
 a
 bunch
 of
 charts,
 which
 he


loves
 to
 do,
 where
 he
 went
 through
 the


individual
 items
 that
 have
 uh
 we've


already
 sort
 of
 made
 a
 bunch
 of
 progress


on.
 So,
 for
 example,
 under
 Joe
 Biden,


uh,
 prescription
 drugs
 were
 up
 9%.
 So


far
 this
 year,
 they're
 down
 610
 of
 a


percent.
 Gasoline
 is
 way
 down.
 It
 was


like
 the
 highest
 ever
 under
 so
 talking


about
 eggs.


>> Yeah,
 he
 was
 talking
 about
 eggs.
 that


and
 and
 so
 I
 I
 think
 that
 the
 way
 to


think
 about
 uh
 inflation
 of
 course
 is


that
 there
 are
 like
 micro
 effects
 like


the
 time
 that
 we
 had
 the
 aven
 flu


affecting
 drug
 prices
 and
 then
 macro


effects
 which
 is
 runaway
 spending
 uh
 big


deficits
 and
 then
 an
 accommodative
 fed


policy


>> and
 I
 think


>> and
 now
 tariffs
 adding
 to
 some
 price


increases
 according
 to
 the
 chair.
 Well,


I
 you
 know
 I
 I
 think
 that
 the
 tariff


evidence
 is
 mixed,
 but
 but
 the


>> once
 again
 making
 the
 argument
 that


there
 are
 a
 there
 there
 are
 multiple


different
 perspectives
 on
 how
 to
 analyze


affordability
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 comes
 down


to
 how
 do
 you
 think
 of
 asset
 prices


versus
 how
 do
 you
 think
 of
 the


president's
 first
 nine
 months
 in
 office?


Different
 questions
 bring
 up
 different


answers,
 but
 this
 administration
 is


going
 with
 the
 route
 that
 the
 economy
 is


growing.
 We're
 going
 to
 get
 rates
 down


and
 as
 a
 result
 GDP
 growth
 being
 up


should
 be
 enough
 to
 help
 the
 average


American.
 Here's
 what
 Kevin
 Hassid
 had


to
 say
 about
 the
 deficit
 as
 well.


>> Uh
 we've
 got
 deficit
 going
 way
 way
 down.


Uh
 so
 right
 now
 it's
 looking
 like
 the


deficit
 for
 this
 year
 will
 be
 $600


billion
 lower
 than
 it
 was
 last
 year.


That
 really
 helps
 lower
 inflation.
 We've


got
 the
 trade
 deficit
 cut
 in
 half
 from


last
 year.
 And
 so
 all
 these
 things
 are


things
 that
 should
 uh
 continue
 to
 move


us
 towards
 the
 Fed
 target
 of
 2%.


>> Now
 again,
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be


contingent
 on
 if
 we
 can
 do
 two
 things.


Well,
 three
 things.
 Number
 one,
 get


rates
 down.
 Number
 two,
 uh
 Tesla
 right


there
 463
 almost
 in
 the
 overnight


markets.
 Number
 two,
 continue
 to
 grow


GDP,


which
 is
 incredibly
 important.
 Uh
 and


then
 number
 three,
 collect
 tariff


revenue
 and
 pay
 off
 our
 debt.
 I
 mean,
 if


we
 could
 meaningfully
 collect
 tariff


revenue
 without
 affecting
 GDP
 growth,
 uh


because
 tariffs
 hopefully
 don't
 have
 an


impact
 on
 overall
 demand,
 which
 is
 kind


of
 what
 JPAL
 was
 saying
 on
 on
 Wednesday,


uh
 and
 we
 can
 lower
 rates
 at
 the
 same


time.
 That
 is
 your
 bullcase
 argument
 for


2026.
 It's
 it's
 really
 not
 that


complicated.
 Rates
 come
 down,
 GDP
 goes


up,
 tariff
 revenue
 helps
 pay
 down
 the


debt,
 and
 tariffs
 don't
 have
 a
 massive


impact
 on
 demand.
 Is
 that
 how
 this
 and


then
 then
 obviously
 the
 AI
 trade
 needs


to
 continue
 to
 be
 as
 strong
 as
 it
 is


with
 earnings
 growing
 at
 the
 rate


they're
 growing
 at.
 If
 that's
 the
 case,


you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 Wall
 Street
 analysts


saying
 7500
 to
 8,000
 on
 the
 S&P
 is
 not


crazy.
 Um,
 which
 would
 be
 a,
 you
 know,


relatively
 strong
 bull
 market.
 it
 would


be
 11%.
 Which
 is
 not
 horrible
 even
 if


it's
 not
 um
 even
 if
 it's
 not
 like
 the


20%
 we've
 had
 over
 the
 past
 couple


years.
 But
 I
 think
 there
 there
 is
 some


fear
 on
 like
 do
 we
 even
 get
 that?


And
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 the
 market
 is


starting
 to
 get
 a
 bit
 more
 concerned


about
 with
 every
 random
 headline
 that


comes
 out
 about
 well
 this
 data
 center
 is


not
 going
 according
 to
 plan.
 All right


dump
 the
 market.
 Like
 it
 really
 is
 crazy


because
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 level
 of


volatility
 is
 going
 anywhere.
 I
 think


2026
 everyone
 has
 to
 be
 prepared
 for
 if


you're
 in
 certain
 high
 beta
 names
 like
 a


coreweave
 and
 a
 data
 center
 headline


comes
 out


we're
 going
 to
 have
 some
 issues


immediately
 we're
 going
 to
 we're
 going


to
 have
 some
 issues
 and
 it's
 just
 like


even
 though
 that
 that
 data
 center


headline
 probably
 doesn't
 have
 a


meaningful
 impact
 on
 coreweave
 but


nonetheless
 that's
 the
 the
 issue
 that
 we


have
 to
 deal
 with
 and
 yes
 as
 people
 are


saying
 in
 the
 in
 the
 comments
 um
 Supreme


Court
 decision
 on
 tariffs
 that
 should
 be


coming
 out
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year


if
 it
 was
 in
 early
 January.
 Trump


already
 tweeted
 a
 lot
 over
 the
 weekend


or
 not
 over
 the
 weekend
 on
 Thursday,


Friday
 about
 how
 the
 Supreme
 Court


decision
 is
 not
 going
 to
 have
 that
 much


of
 an
 impact
 because
 they're
 going
 to


find
 a
 way
 to
 implement
 tariffs
 in
 a


different
 way.


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 they're


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that,
 but
 I
 mean


that's
 going
 to
 be
 something
 where
 the


market's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 ask
 some


questions.
 Again,
 the
 bull
 case
 here
 is


the
 market
 doesn't
 like
 the
 tariffs
 in


the
 first
 place.
 So,
 good
 that
 we
 get


rid
 of
 them.
 fair
 cases
 we
 lose
 a
 lot
 of


negotiating
 power
 with
 countries
 that
 we


had
 all
 these
 trade
 deals
 on
 with


tariffs
 which
 by
 the
 way
 we
 we
 still


have
 not
 signed
 like
 an
 official


official
 trade
 deal
 with
 a
 bunch
 of


countries
 including
 India
 that
 was


supposed
 to
 be
 a
 big
 one
 that
 one
 didn't


happen
 yet
 China
 we've
 signed
 a
 couple


of
 things
 and
 we've
 started
 the
 export


of
 rare
 earth
 minerals
 again
 with
 them


but
 there's
 a
 few
 big
 countries
 that
 we


still
 need
 to
 get
 those
 in
 place
 and


hopefully
 that
 happens
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the


year
 um
 here's
 another
 update
 on
 the


2026
 S&P
 500
 targets
 from
 the
 compound


pound
 this
 weekend.


>> Come
 on,
 dude.


>> They're
 at
 6378.
 Isn't
 the
 S&P
 higher?


Come
 on.


>> So,
 let's
 let's
 set
 this
 up.
 Um,
 this
 is


Wall
 Street
 Strategist
 2026
 S&P
 500


targets.
 The
 average
 target
 for
 next


year
 7512,


which
 implies
 from
 yesterday's
 close


about
 a
 10%
 return.
 What?
 It's
 like


magic.
 about
 a
 10%
 return
 for
 the
 S&P,


>> give
 or
 take,


>> which
 relative
 to
 recent
 years
 is


actually
 on
 the
 bullish
 side
 cuz
 two


years
 ago,
 I
 think
 the
 call
 for
 2023
 was


flat.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 of
 course,
 we
 went
 up
 30%.


>> So,
 um
 I
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 find
 it's


interesting
 to
 just
 see
 where
 people's


heads
 are
 at.


>> Can
 you
 just
 pause
 for
 a
 second?
 It's


insane
 that
 like
 we
 have
 this
 thing
 in


America
 that
 by
 and
 large
 like
 that's


like
 10%
 year
 after
 year
 after
 year.


It's
 just
 like
 free
 money.
 No,
 I'm
 like


getting


>> I
 think
 that
 the
 returns
 of
 the
 market


in
 America
 have
 really
 been


extraordinary.


>> Did
 you
 see
 the
 bank
 on
 that
 chart?


That's
 like
 bang
 on
 10%.


>> Oh,
 there
 was
 one.


>> Amazing.


>> Of
 course
 it
 was.
 It's
 It's
 a
 shortcut.


>> Yeah.


>> Um,
 can
 I
 tell
 you
 that
 10
 years
 in


podcasting,


>> you're
 kind
 of
 like
 the
 Simpsons
 like


this.


>> We're
 still
 funny
 though,
 right?


>> No.
 So
 10%
 up
 from
 the
 Wall
 Street
 banks


is
 their
 target
 for
 the
 S&P
 which
 would


put
 you
 round
 about
 at
 that
 75
 7600


level.
 I
 mean
 what
 are
 we
 thinking
 if


you
 had
 to
 pick
 if
 you
 were
 a
 Wall


Street
 analyst
 and
 in
 the
 chat
 you
 had


to
 put
 out
 a
 target
 on
 the
 S&P.


Put
 your
 target
 in
 the
 chat.


I
 I
 feel
 like
 the
 easy
 argument
 is
 10%.


That's
 like
 a
 sort
 of
 non-contrarian


view
 right
 here.


Obviously,
 if
 you're
 a
 bit
 more
 bearish


and
 again
 like
 I
 think
 there's
 reasons


to
 be
 bearish.
 I
 would
 just
 be
 curious


if
 someone's
 saying
 like
 5,500
 6,000.


I'd
 be
 like,
 well,
 why?
 Because
 we
 know


earnings
 are
 going
 to
 grow.
 I
 mean,
 I


think
 we're
 going
 to
 escape
 a
 recession.


Yes,
 rates
 are
 going to
 come
 down.
 That


doesn't
 mean
 like
 Bitcoin
 has
 to
 go
 to
 a


million
 dollars,
 but
 that
 also
 means


that
 I
 mean,
 Bitcoin
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


bit
 more
 attractive
 than
 other
 assets
 if


rates
 come
 down.
 So,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 the


entire
 market
 doesn't
 have
 to
 have
 some


2022
 type
 of
 scenario.
 So,
 if
 the
 target


is
 significantly
 lower,
 I
 would
 be


curious
 why.
 But
 also,
 I
 don't
 think
 the


target
 can
 be
 that
 much
 higher
 because


AI
 trade
 is
 definitely
 getting
 a
 bit


exhausted
 and
 markets
 going
 to
 have
 to


try
 to
 consolidate
 how
 it
 plays
 out.


Wow,
 I'm
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 76
 and
 77s.


I
 see
 a
 very
 few
 8000s.


Someone
 says
 10,000
 because
 who
 cares?


Could
 you
 imagine
 10,000
 next
 year?


That'd
 be
 absolutely
 crazy.


Yeah,
 most
 of
 you
 guys
 are
 within
 that


75
 to
 7,700
 range.
 So,
 we're
 all
 taking


the
 10%
 consensus
 view.
 Last
 year,
 I


think
 the
 average
 was
 67
 from
 Wall


Street.
 Um,
 and
 it
 looks
 like
 hopefully


we
 end
 at
 around
 at
 least
 6,800.
 So,
 not


like
 it
 was
 necessarily
 that
 different.


But
 if
 we
 do
 get
 75,
 that
 would
 be
 the


the
 the
 fourth
 year
 of
 the
 bull
 market,


which
 does
 not
 include
 a
 backtoback
 to


backto
 back
 year
 of
 20%.
 Which
 is


reasonable.


Granted,
 if
 everyone's
 not
 expecting


20%,
 maybe
 that
 helps
 us
 get
 to
 20%
 just


based
 on
 more
 and
 more
 uh
 people
 saying,


"Hey,
 you
 know,
 we
 need
 to
 allocate
 our


money
 somewhere."
 But
 then
 you
 get


headlines
 like
 this
 that
 really
 start
 to


make
 you
 wonder
 what
 the
 hell's
 going
 on


in
 the
 market.
 So,
 the
 Wall
 Street


Journal
 did
 an
 expose
 on
 OpenAI
 over
 the


weekend.
 Apparently,
 the
 company
 is


getting
 rid
 of
 their
 vesting
 period
 and


the
 cliff
 for
 talent
 inside
 of
 the


company.
 So,
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 stay
 six


months
 just
 to
 get
 your
 stock
 vested.


The
 idea
 is
 this
 is
 actually
 going
 to


retain
 talent
 versus
 allow
 talent
 to


leave.
 So,
 they're
 kind
 of
 going
 a


little
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 counterintuitive


way
 on
 controlling
 and
 keeping
 their


talent
 as
 the
 intense
 talent
 war
 heats


up
 in
 the
 foundation
 model
 companies.


But
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 also


reported
 that
 the
 company
 expects
 to


spend
 $6
 billion
 in
 2025


on
 stockbased
 compensation,
 which
 is


almost
 half
 its
 projected
 revenue.
 Now


Sam
 Alman
 says
 their
 revenue
 is
 20


billion,
 not
 12
 billion.
 Okay,
 so
 then


it's
 about
 a
 third
 of
 their
 revenue
 on


stockbased
 comp,
 which
 I
 get
 it.
 You
 got


to
 pay
 the
 AI
 researchers
 money.
 Like


you
 got
 to
 give
 them
 an
 incentive
 to
 to


stay
 at
 the
 company
 or
 else
 Zu
 is
 going


to
 take
 them
 or
 Google's
 going
 to
 take


them.
 But
 my
 goodness,
 that's


aggressive.


Almost
 a
 third
 of
 your
 revenue
 in


stockbased
 comp.
 This
 is
 not
 a
 company


that's
 uh
 generating
 any
 positive
 free


cash
 flow
 like
 the
 tech
 companies
 are


able
 to
 do.
 So
 it
 really
 then,
 you
 know,


gets
 people
 worried
 about
 does
 Sam
 Alman


have
 the
 money?
 Can
 he
 get
 to
 1.4


trillion
 in
 spending
 commitments?
 And
 if


he
 can't,
 what
 companies
 are
 going
 to
 be


collateral
 damage?
 Is
 it
 going to
 be


OpenAI?
 Is
 it
 going to
 be
 Oracle?
 um
 or


sorry
 is
 it
 going to
 be
 AMD,
 Oracle,


Nvidia,
 which
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 companies


already
 have
 started
 to
 distance


themselves
 a
 little
 bit
 from
 OpenAI.


Disney
 leaned
 into
 it
 though
 this
 week


with
 their
 partnership.
 But
 it
 just


makes
 you
 question
 things.
 And
 so
 again,


I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 death
 of


OpenAI
 is
 happening.
 I
 I
 was
 actually
 at


a
 family
 event
 today
 and
 I
 was
 speaking


to
 one
 of
 my
 uncles.
 He's
 a
 bit
 older.


He's
 um
 I
 think
 he's
 like
 84
 and
 uh
 he


was
 just
 telling
 me
 how
 much
 he's
 in


love
 with
 Hatchet.
 He's
 like,
 "This


thing
 just
 gives
 you
 every
 single


answer."
 And
 it's
 like,
 I'm
 just
 on
 this


all
 day
 asking
 questions.
 I
 was
 like,


"How
 do
 you
 like
 it
 compared
 to
 Google?"


He
 was
 like, "Google?
 I
 don't
 use
 Google


anymore.
 I
 use
 chatbt."
 Now,
 he
 doesn't


know
 about
 Gemini.
 He
 doesn't
 know
 about


anthropic.
 He
 doesn't
 know
 about
 it,
 but


he
 knows
 about
 chatbt
 because
 it's
 gone


that
 mainstream,
 which
 is
 once
 again,


when
 you
 hear
 that
 type
 of
 stuff,
 you


recognize
 how
 magical
 the
 feeling
 is


when
 someone
 interacts
 with
 an
 LLM.
 A


lot
 of
 us
 because
 we're
 in
 the
 tech


ecosystem
 in
 the
 business
 world,
 we've


used
 so
 many
 of
 them
 that
 you
 know
 we've


kind
 of
 been
 a
 little
 desensitized
 to


it.
 But
 the
 average
 person
 AI
 equals
 GPT


and
 uh
 you
 know
 that
 that
 strangle
 hold


that
 GPT
 has
 over
 at
 this
 point
 900


million
 weekly
 active
 users
 is
 enough
 to


keep
 growing.
 Is
 it
 just
 enough
 to
 spend


a
 trillion
 dollars
 on
 on
 capex
 that
 they


don't
 have
 yet?


I
 think
 that
 is
 the
 broader
 question


which
 is


which
 is
 what
 we're
 going to
 have
 to


see.
 He
 doesn't
 pay
 for
 it.
 I
 asked
 him


does
 he
 pay
 for
 it
 and
 he
 says
 no.
 Uh
 he


said
 they
 they
 he
 said
 I
 asked
 Shajip


what
 do
 I
 get
 if
 I
 pay
 20
 bucks
 a
 month


and
 she
 gave
 me
 a
 good
 answer
 but
 I


don't
 use
 it
 enough
 to
 justify
 paying


for
 it
 which
 is
 fair.
 He
 uses
 it
 every


day
 but
 it's
 not
 like
 he's
 asking
 some


very
 complicated
 question
 or
 sending
 a


bunch
 of
 PDFs
 where
 the
 chat
 needs
 to


read
 the
 attachment
 and
 if
 you
 don't


have
 the
 paid
 version
 it's
 not
 going
 to


be
 able
 to
 do
 that.
 like
 he's
 just


asking
 it
 basic
 stuff
 all
 day.
 It's


giving
 an
 answer.
 He
 loves
 using
 it,
 but


not
 enough
 to
 pay
 for
 it.
 So,


it's
 one
 of
 those
 things
 where
 obviously


AI
 is
 not
 going
 anywhere.
 It's
 just
 the


market's
 starting
 to
 wonder,
 can
 GBT
 pay


for
 all
 this
 stuff
 or
 OpenAI?


And
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 that'll
 be
 the


broader
 question
 going
 into
 as
 well
 of


2026.
 ETH
 right
 here
 getting
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 green
 candle.
 Very
 small
 one


right
 here.
 Ethereum
 is


Yeah,
 303
 to
 309.


You're
 getting
 everything
 going
 green,


guys.
 After
 hours,
 Nvidia
 going
 green
 or


in
 the
 overnight
 markets,
 Weeble
 green,


Tesla's
 green.
 As
 soon
 as
 the
 market


opened,
 there
 was
 like
 three
 or
 four


stocks


um
 that
 were
 green,
 like
 some
 of
 your


big
 tech
 stocks,
 and
 they
 were
 slightly


green.
 Goldman
 and
 Lily
 are
 continuing


to
 pump.
 Look
 at
 Lily
 up
 1.4.
 S&P
 is
 now


getting
 an
 actual
 move
 21%.
 Amazon's
 up.


Oaklo's
 up.
 Broadcom's
 still
 down,


although
 it's
 not
 down
 as
 much
 as
 it
 was


before.
 It
 was
 at
 355,
 now
 it's
 at
 358.


Um,


I
 thought
 about
 Broadcom
 over
 the


weekend.
 The
 only
 thing
 I
 can


realistically
 say
 for
 why
 this
 thing


dumped
 is
 I
 looked
 deeper
 into
 the


multiples.
 This
 thing
 is
 an
 expensive


stock.
 When
 Chris
 was
 on
 the
 show
 on
 the


day
 of
 earnings
 and
 we
 were
 like
 looking


at
 the
 multiples,
 Chris
 was
 a
 thousand%


right
 when
 he
 was
 comparing
 it
 to


Nvidia.
 And
 like
 you
 can
 hate
 Nvidia
 or


whatever,
 but
 my
 goodness,
 they're
 going


way
 faster
 than
 Broadcom
 and
 they're


trading
 significantly
 cheaper
 than
 Broad


Broadcom
 looks
 Broadcom
 makes
 Nvidia


look
 like
 a
 screaming
 buy
 or
 Nvidia


makes
 Broadcom
 look
 like
 a
 screaming


sell.
 So
 forget
 the
 long-term


fundamental
 thesis
 of
 Broadcom.
 Like
 I'm


not
 even
 talking
 about
 that.
 Just
 the


multiple
 on
 this
 bad
 boy
 at
 420
 was


aggressive.
 Like
 very
 aggressive.
 And
 so


the
 fact
 that
 it
 fell
 almost
 seems
 like


inevitable
 now.
 Like
 they
 could
 have


said
 anything
 on
 that
 call.
 It
 was
 just


way
 too
 just
 like
 pound
 when
 it
 got
 to


222
 in
 the
 overnight
 markets
 or
 in
 the


after
 hour
 markets
 just
 like
 when


Broadcom
 got
 to
 420.
 It's
 like
 yeah
 that


was
 amazing
 seeing
 it
 but
 at
 222
 they


had
 one
 of
 the
 best
 quarters
 in
 history


but
 still
 like
 the
 multiple
 just
 got
 up


there
 and
 so
 it
 ended
 up
 taking
 a
 hit


and
 the
 hit
 to
 180
 sucks
 for
 a
 lot
 of


people
 but
 180
 is
 still
 a
 relatively


strong
 price
 for
 pounder.
 360
 is
 still
 a


pretty
 strong
 price
 for
 Broadcom.
 So
 I


think
 with
 this
 one
 consolidating
 the


gains
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 horrible.
 I


don't
 know if
 this
 easily
 rebounds
 back


up
 11%.


That
 lost,
 but
 it
 showed
 me
 that
 Nvidia


continues
 to
 be
 disrespected.
 In
 fact,


here's
 a
 comparison
 between
 these
 two.


By
 the
 way,
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 energy


and
 data
 centers.
 Elon
 tweeted
 this


today
 as
 well.
 The
 sun
 is
 an
 enormous


free
 fusion
 reactor
 in
 the
 sky.
 It
 is


super
 dumb
 to
 make
 tiny
 fusion
 reactors


on
 Earth.
 Even
 if
 you
 burn
 four


Jupiters,
 the
 sun
 would
 still
 round
 up


to
 about
 100%
 of
 all
 the
 power
 that


would
 ever
 be
 produced
 in
 the
 solar


system.
 Stop
 wasting
 money
 on
 puny


little
 reactors
 unless
 actively


acknowledging
 that
 they
 are
 just
 there


for
 your
 pet
 science
 project.


So
 you
 got
 Elon
 with
 a
 pretty
 big


endorsement


of
 solar
 and
 meaningfully
 using
 the
 sun


and
 kind
 of
 saying
 building
 these


reactors
 is
 kind
 of
 stupid.


But
 uh
 I
 think
 he
 also
 understands
 how


much
 energy
 we
 need
 for
 this
 AI
 buildup


and
 that's
 why
 he's
 saying
 we
 need
 to
 be


more
 excited
 for
 the
 sun.
 So
 take
 a
 look


at
 this.
 Broadcom
 trades
 at
 35
 times


next
 12
 months
 PE
 with
 a
 huge
 moat
 and


estimates
 about
 50%
 EPS
 growth
 next


year.
 Nvidia
 trades
 at
 25
 times
 10
 times


lower
 than
 Broadcom
 with
 an
 even
 bigger


moat.
 I
 think
 we
 would
 say
 Nvidia's
 moat


is
 objectively
 bigger
 than
 Broadcom's


moat
 and
 estimates
 of
 57%
 EPS
 growth


next
 year.


I
 mean,
 it
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 Nvidia
 needs


to
 be
 $250,
 but
 my
 goodness,
 Broadcom


trading
 at
 this
 multiple
 with
 Nvidia
 now


trading
 at
 175
 is
 just
 kind
 of
 dumb.
 And


maybe
 the
 market
 recognizes
 that
 going


into
 next
 week,


but
 maybe
 they
 don't.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to


see.
 But
 yeah,
 I
 don't
 expect
 Broadcom


to
 have
 that
 big
 of
 a
 recovery.
 I
 think


we
 can
 see
 back
 up
 to
 380
 this
 week
 if


we
 kind
 of
 like
 get
 a
 little
 move
 on
 the


S&P
 back
 up
 to
 400
 might
 be
 a
 little


tougher.
 Nvidia
 though
 up
 76%
 176


in
 the
 overnight
 markets.
 The
 reason
 it


says
 fiscal
 year
 2027
 is
 because


remember
 Nvidia
 has
 like
 a
 weird


calendar
 cycle.
 So
 technically
 that's


next
 year's
 fiscal
 year.
 Although
 that
 I


don't
 know
 why
 Snowflake
 does
 this.
 I


hate
 when
 companies
 do
 it,
 but
 it's
 it


it
 means
 next
 year,
 even
 though
 they're


saying
 it's
 2027.


So,
 yeah,
 I
 think
 Broadcom's
 fine,
 but
 I


do
 think
 video
 right
 here


is
 uh
 is
 cheaper.
 And
 again,
 Broadcom


has
 a
 massive
 moat
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 A6,


and
 they're
 doing
 a
 lot
 of
 different


work
 with
 those
 companies
 are
 working


with.
 They
 got,
 I
 think,
 another
 11


billion
 contract
 with
 um
 Anthropic
 for


TPUs.


But
 again,
 the
 multiple
 compared
 to
 the


growth,
 it's
 not
 really
 adding
 up
 here.


And
 so
 it
 seemed
 kind
 of
 inevitable
 the


stock
 was
 going
 to
 take
 a
 little
 bit
 of


a
 tumble
 if
 everything
 didn't
 go


perfect.
 And
 then
 they
 said
 a
 couple


things
 that
 weren't
 perfect
 and
 then


stock
 took
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 tumble.
 Tassel


right
 there
 at
 462
 still
 moving
 after


hours.
 Bitcoin
 as
 well.
 You're
 getting
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 pump
 back
 to
 89.
 Yeah,


that's
 actually
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 $1,500


candle
 right
 there.
 882


to
 89.
 Weeble
 right
 there
 916.
 Tesla's


up
 a
 bit.
 Goldman
 Sachs
 up.
 JP
 Morgan


up.
 Apple
 that's
 up.
 Bit
 mine's
 still


down,
 but
 it's
 up
 from
 where
 it
 was.


Amazon's
 up
 and
 then
 the
 S&P
 continues


to
 move
 up.
 Oracle
 as
 well,
 like


Broadcom


not
 getting
 a
 move
 after
 hours


as
 that
 one
 continues
 to
 go
 red.
 I
 think


Oracle
 consolidating
 here
 and
 and


Broadcom
 consolidating
 here
 is
 bullish


just
 because
 they
 all
 trade
 at


high
 multiples.
 Oracle
 not
 as
 high
 as


Broadcom
 but
 Oracle
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 debt


and
 so
 that's
 where
 you
 got
 to
 discount


it.
 Uh
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 should
 be


lower
 than
 these.
 I
 mean
 Oracle
 should


not
 go
 to
 like
 170.
 Broadcom
 should
 not


go
 to
 the
 low
 300s.
 That
 would
 be
 a
 bit


aggressive.
 Even
 Robin
 at
 120
 after


hours
 that
 one
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 pump


as
 well
 which
 is
 nice
 to
 see.
 Pounder


right
 there
 18318
 that's
 down
 about


0.21%.


Okay
 cool.
 So
 that's
 what
 we
 had
 with


Broadcom
 and
 Oracle.
 Uh
 we
 talked
 about


the
 SpaceX
 IPO.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 some


macro
 charts.
 So,
 a
 couple
 different


things
 we
 have
 on
 macros.
 So,
 first
 of


all,
 this
 is
 something
 you're
 going
 to


see
 a
 lot
 of
 in
 2026.
 It
 is
 something


the
 administration
 is
 going
 to
 have
 to


figure
 out
 because
 right
 now
 we
 don't


have


well,
 I
 guess
 a
 meaningful
 solution
 to


this.
 Uh,
 student
 loan
 balances
 90
 days


delinquent
 have
 jumped
 up
 to
 about
 10%


in
 2025
 Q1
 versus
 just
 half
 a
 percent
 a


year
 ago,
 roughly
 back
 to
 prepandemic


levels
 after
 the
 Biden
 payment
 pause


ended.
 So
 obviously
 this
 was
 inevitably


going
 to
 happen
 simply
 because
 of
 the


fact
 that
 we
 had
 a
 massive
 pause
 over


the
 past
 five
 years
 and
 now
 student


loans
 are
 coming
 back.
 However,
 this
 is


another
 form
 of
 deflation
 because
 if


people
 have
 to
 make
 that
 $400
 or
 $500


payment
 every
 single
 month
 to
 their


student
 loans,
 they're
 not
 going to
 be


able
 to
 put
 that
 money
 into
 the
 economy.


And
 the
 fact
 that
 we're
 seeing
 those


loans
 go
 delinquent
 means
 that
 people


don't
 even
 have
 enough
 money
 to
 to
 make


those
 payments.
 So,
 you
 know,
 when
 when


Trump
 talks
 about
 affordability,
 the


student
 loans,
 credit
 card
 loans,
 auto


loans,
 these
 are
 the
 things
 that
 pop
 up


and
 without
 a
 meaningful
 way
 to,
 you


know,
 respond
 to
 that
 crisis


essentially.
 And
 if
 this
 number
 gets


worse,
 then,
 you
 know,
 it's
 going
 to


become
 a
 a
 bigger
 crisis,
 we're
 going
 to


have
 a
 broader
 issue.
 Obviously,
 the
 the


the
 the
 sort
 of
 underwriting
 of
 degrees


has
 been
 discussed
 many
 many
 times.
 Uh,


a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 said
 the
 federal


government
 should
 not
 be
 giving
 out


loans
 to
 degrees
 that
 aren't
 going
 to


actually
 make
 money.
 The
 problem
 here
 is


that
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


questioning
 what
 degrees
 actually
 make


money,


right?
 Like
 in
 the
 world
 of
 AI,


a
 computer
 science
 degree
 theoretically


should
 be
 able
 to
 make
 more
 money
 than


like
 a
 gender
 study
 degree,
 but
 I
 think


there
 was
 some
 question
 about
 like,
 hey,


is
 a
 computer
 science
 degree
 still
 going


to
 be
 super
 super
 valuable
 in
 five


years,
 which
 I
 think
 objectively
 it
 will


be.
 But
 if
 we
 were
 to
 overhaul
 the


entire
 federal
 underwriting
 process
 for


student
 loans,
 that
 would
 be
 the
 first


step
 in
 changing,
 you
 know,
 the
 process


of
 these
 loans
 going
 delinquent.
 But


that's
 something
 that
 I
 don't know
 if


any
 administration
 is
 willing
 to
 do


because
 that
 means
 basically
 rejecting


people
 from
 going
 to
 college
 unless
 they


study
 XYZ.
 And
 the
 colleges
 don't
 love


that
 because
 they
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 money


from
 people
 studying
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 that


doesn't
 matter.
 I
 know
 this
 for
 a
 fact


because
 I
 went
 to
 business
 school
 and


didn't
 learn
 anything
 about
 business.


But
 like
 Ruckers
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 out


of
 me
 uh
 for
 honestly
 doing
 nothing.


Like
 so
 I
 mean
 the
 colleges
 have
 a
 very


perverse
 incentive
 right
 here
 especially


the
 state
 colleges
 because
 they
 get
 a


lot
 of
 federal
 grants
 and
 subsidies
 for


this
 stuff.


But
 if
 we
 don't
 make
 a
 change
 there
 then


I
 think these
 loans
 are
 going
 to


continue
 to
 be
 delinquent


which
 is
 going
 to
 be
 you
 know
 not
 the


best
 thing
 in
 the
 world
 to
 necessarily


see.
 Having
 said
 that,
 that
 was
 the


update
 on
 the
 macro
 in
 terms
 of
 loans
 in


terms
 of
 retail
 investors.
 So,
 take
 a


look
 at
 this
 chart.
 I
 thought
 this
 was


pretty
 incredible
 as
 well.
 So,
 this
 is
 a


chart
 about
 retail
 investors
 in
 the
 blue


versus
 long
 only
 hedge
 funds
 in
 the
 red.


Retail
 investors
 accounted
 for
 20%
 of
 US


stock
 market
 trading
 volume
 in
 Q3,


second
 highest
 on
 record.
 This
 is
 only


below
 the
 Q1
 2021
 peak
 during
 the
 meme


stock
 frenzy.
 By
 comparison,
 before


2020,
 this
 percentage
 averaged
 15%
 for


several
 years.
 it
 is
 now
 5%
 above
 that.


Uh
 these
 funds
 are
 also
 now
 at
 half
 of


their
 levels
 seen
 in
 2015
 making
 one
 of


the
 most
 notable
 shifts
 in
 market


structure
 in
 decades.
 To
 put
 this
 into


perspective,
 the
 combined
 percentage
 of


all
 funds
 including
 long
 only
 hedge


funds
 and
 quants
 was
 just
 31%
 in
 Q3.


Retail
 was
 20%.
 Which
 means
 if
 you
 take


into
 account
 hundreds
 of
 billions
 of


dollars
 of
 hedge
 funds,
 quant
 and
 long


only
 it
 was
 only
 11%
 higher
 than
 retail.


which
 once
 again
 goes
 to
 show
 that


retail
 is
 a
 massive
 massive
 force
 in
 the


ecosystem
 of
 the
 stock
 market.
 It's
 just


now
 going
 to
 be
 a
 question
 of
 how
 much


does
 that
 force
 continue
 to
 play
 out


going
 into
 the


going
 into
 the
 next
 year
 hopefully
 this


bull
 cycle
 which
 is
 essentially
 the


fourth
 year
 uh
 of
 this
 bull
 cycle
 and


like
 I
 don't
 think
 realistically
 there's


a
 world
 where
 retail
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be


a
 big
 force


>> like
 year
 could
 you
 imagine
 retail
 not


playing
 the
 only
 way
 that
 happens
 is
 if


we
 have
 a
 market
 meltdown
 because
 then


people
 get
 wiped
 out
 and
 they
 they
 stop


investing
 but
 if
 things
 are
 even
 flat


next
 year
 for
 get
 bullish
 I
 think
 retail


continues
 to
 allocate
 capital


and
 put
 money
 into
 the
 markets.


Now,
 could
 we
 get
 rugged
 with
 a
 a
 ugly


ugly
 decline?
 Yeah,
 that's
 possible
 and


that
 would
 definitely
 get
 I
 mean
 that


happened
 in
 2022.
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 people
 that
 just
 didn't
 care
 about


the
 market
 anymore
 once
 they
 saw
 their


portfolio
 get
 hit.
 Um,


but
 I
 also
 think
 that
 would
 create
 such


a
 massive
 opportunity
 that
 like
 I
 wonder


on
 the
 5%
 draw
 down
 we
 got
 in
 November


right
 before
 Thanksgiving.
 The
 put
 call


volume
 was
 at
 one
 of
 its
 highest
 levels


ever.
 Aka
 people
 just
 bought
 tons
 of


calls
 because
 they
 were
 like,
 "Oh,


stocks
 are
 cheap."
 Like
 I
 wonder
 how
 low


does
 the
 S&P
 have
 to
 go
 for
 people
 to
 be


demoralized?
 Because
 one
 thing
 we've


heard
 about
 the
 retail
 investor
 is
 that


it's
 or
 one
 thing
 we've
 seen
 over
 the


past
 three
 years
 is
 that
 we
 are
 in
 a
 buy


the
 dip
 generation.
 It's
 not
 easy
 to
 be


demoralized


uh
 when
 you
 think
 that
 every
 dip
 gets


rewarded.
 And
 until
 we
 have
 a


cataclysmic
 event
 where
 the
 dips
 I
 mean


even
 if
 you
 bought
 the
 extreme
 fear


November
 dip,
 you
 were
 rewarded.
 Not


every
 stock
 has
 got
 back
 to
 alltime


highs,
 but
 I
 mean
 Rocket
 Lab
 was
 like
 at


$38.
 It's
 at
 almost
 65
 right
 now.
 By
 the


way,
 we're
 back
 at
 fear
 at
 42.
 You
 got


rewarded.
 You
 know,
 Robin
 was
 at
 100.


Pounder
 was
 at
 147.
 Uh
 Nvidia
 got
 below


170.
 So,
 so
 the
 point
 is
 I
 think
 when
 we


stop
 getting
 rewarded,
 that's
 when
 you


stop
 getting
 people
 to
 buy,
 aka
 a


prolonged
 downturn,
 which
 we
 haven't


seen
 in
 about
 three
 years.
 I
 mean,


again,
 the
 closest
 we
 got
 to
 it
 was


liberation
 day
 and
 that
 Vshaped
 very


quickly.


So,
 I
 think
 you're
 going
 to
 need
 a
 very,


you
 know,
 uh,
 differentiated
 string
 of


events
 to
 come
 together
 to
 create
 that


prolonged
 downturn
 to
 get
 people
 to


think
 the
 dip
 isn't
 bought.
 And
 that


that
 that
 that
 also
 is
 going
 to
 be
 an


ugly
 situation
 if
 it
 happens
 because
 if


you
 remember
 in
 2022
 there
 were
 many


moments
 throughout
 the
 year
 where
 people


including
 myself
 uh
 didn't
 really


believe
 it
 was
 a
 bare
 market.
 They
 just


kept
 buying
 the
 dip
 and
 then
 there
 were


certain
 spikes
 up
 where
 like
 oh
 we're
 in


the
 clear.
 We're
 good.
 We're
 back
 to
 go


and
 then
 boom
 we
 came
 right
 back
 down.


Right
 back
 down.
 And
 now
 in
 hindsight
 it


makes
 sense
 that
 that
 was
 going
 to


happen
 because
 you
 know
 JPAL
 is
 not


going
 to
 stop
 raising
 rates.
 But


now
 JPAL's
 cutting
 rates,
 which
 is
 why


it
 would
 be
 very
 weird
 to
 get
 a


prolonged
 downturn.
 If
 we
 do
 get
 a


prolonged
 downturn
 into
 a
 rate
 cutting


cycle
 with
 the
 overall
 AI
 trade,
 and


everyone
 keeps
 thinking
 it's
 not


prolonged,
 aka
 they
 keep
 buying
 the
 dip


and
 stop
 getting
 rewarded.
 You
 would


have
 to
 have
 10
 to
 15%
 down,
 maybe
 20%


down
 before
 people
 are
 like,
 you
 know


what,
 I'm
 done.
 I'm
 just
 I'm
 not


touching.
 I
 mean,
 people
 bought
 the
 dip


on
 Friday.
 I
 bought
 the
 dip
 on
 Friday.


They
 didn't
 buy
 a
 crazy
 amount
 of
 the


dip,
 but
 I
 bought
 a
 little
 bit.
 I
 bought


Invidia
 at
 175.
 bot
 hood
 at
 119,
 bot


grab
 at
 515.
 So
 like


until
 those
 don't
 get
 rewarded,
 I
 think


you
 will
 have
 a
 buy
 the
 dip
 generation


continue
 to
 buy
 along
 with
 the


institutions
 who
 might
 you
 know
 continue


to
 buy
 as
 well
 and
 that's
 what
 creates


that
 momentum.
 Tesla
 right
 there
 at
 462


that's
 up
 71%
 as
 well


in
 the
 overnight
 markets.
 You
 assume


everyone
 has
 liquidity
 to
 buy
 the
 dip.


Well
 look
 I
 agree.
 I
 mean,
 liquidity
 to


buy
 the
 dip
 is
 something
 that's
 also


going
 to
 be
 necessary
 next
 year.
 And
 if


we
 have
 a
 ugly
 labor
 market,
 which
 we're


going to
 get
 jobs
 data
 on
 the
 16th,
 so


that's
 going
 to
 be
 very,
 very
 important


to
 see.
 This
 is
 the
 first
 jobs
 data


after
 the
 rate
 cut,


that
 is
 also
 going
 to
 be
 a
 massive


implication
 or
 a
 massive
 impact
 have
 a


massive
 impact
 on


if
 liquidity
 holds
 up.
 Uh
 Santa
 Claus


rally
 since
 1929.
 Here's
 a
 good
 chart


that
 I
 saw
 this
 morning.
 The
 S&P
 500
 has


risen
 in
 79%
 of
 Santa
 Claus
 rallies,


average
 return
 of
 1.6%.
 It
 covers
 the


last
 five
 trading
 days
 of
 December.
 So,


it
 starts
 December
 26th
 and
 the
 first


two
 trading
 days
 of
 January.
 The
 S&P
 500


has
 also
 posted
 positive
 results
 in
 79%


of
 these
 periods
 since
 1950.


All
 while
 the
 last
 two
 weeks
 of
 December


have
 been
 the
 best
 weeks
 for
 stocks
 over


the
 past
 75
 years,
 we
 are
 officially
 in


the
 last
 two
 weeks
 of
 December.


So
 theoretically


and
 historically
 the
 next
 two
 weeks


should
 be
 nice
 to
 us.
 The
 question
 is


going
 to
 be
 how
 nice
 if
 they
 are
 nice
 or


if
 we
 get
 a
 2018
 December
 where
 we
 think


it's
 going
 to
 be
 nice
 and
 then
 it


completely
 goes
 the
 opposite
 direction.


The
 difference
 here
 and
 I
 know
 people


say
 the
 shutdown
 the
 tariffs
 very


similar
 to
 2018.
 The
 big
 difference
 is


in
 2018
 JPAL
 was
 hiking.
 Everyone


forgets
 that.
 I
 know
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


comparisons
 to
 December
 2018
 that
 seem


similar,
 but
 the
 the
 one
 part
 that


people
 leave
 out
 is
 that
 JPAL
 was


hiking.
 JPAL
 is
 now
 cutting.
 He
 just
 cut


on
 Wednesday.
 So,
 I
 think
 you
 just
 have


a
 fundamentally
 different
 rate
 cutting


cycle
 uh
 going
 into
 2026


that
 has
 already
 started
 as
 per
 last


Wednesday


is
 how
 you
 know
 December,
 end
 of
 2025


could
 play
 out.
 Here
 is
 what
 Deutsche


Bank
 said
 on
 their
 S&P
 500
 target.
 They


are
 thinking
 7500
 for
 2026.


>> See
 this
 weakness
 that
 we
 saw
 especially


in
 the
 first
 half
 of
 this
 year.
 You
 know


if
 you
 look
 the
 dollar
 started
 to


stabilize
 in
 the
 second
 half
 since
 this


Mara
 Lago
 accord
 related
 you
 know


concerns
 that
 people
 had.
 I
 mean
 there


was
 an
 concern
 that
 the
 incoming


administration
 really
 wanted
 a
 weak


dollar
 just
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 the


trade
 deficits
 gets
 rectified
 and
 our


exports
 become
 more
 competitive.
 I
 think


now
 the
 narrative
 has
 changed
 especially


with
 the
 Fed
 now
 saying
 that
 we're
 not


going
 to
 be
 cutting
 as
 as
 many
 cuts


going
 into
 2026
 as
 what
 the
 street
 was


initially
 expecting.
 So
 I
 think
 when
 you


look
 at
 the
 strength
 of
 the
 economy


which
 tends
 to
 be
 a
 good
 precursor
 to


the
 underlying
 currency
 strength
 when


you
 look
 at
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 equity


markets
 are
 generating
 double-digit


returns
 again
 this
 year
 uh
 that
 should


attract
 a
 lot
 of
 fund
 flows.
 When
 you


look
 at
 all
 these
 things
 together,
 it's


hard
 to
 make
 the
 narrative
 that
 the


dollar
 is
 going
 to
 decline
 as
 much
 as
 we


saw
 this
 year.
 And
 if
 you
 were
 to
 zoom


out
 a
 bit,
 yes,
 dollar
 had
 a
 pretty
 weak


2025,
 but
 we
 still
 up
 7%
 uh
 you
 know,


since
 2021
 and
 on
 annualized
 basis


around
 2%.
 So,
 I'm
 not
 too
 you
 know,
 our


outlook
 is
 that
 against
 some
 emerging


market
 currencies,
 you
 might
 see
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 dollar
 weakness,
 but


your
 dollar
 at
 115
 and
 dollar
 yen
 at
 145


is
 our
 12-month
 outlook.
 On
 a
 day
 where


we're
 getting
 reports
 that
 there
 could


be
 more
 seizures
 of
 more
 Venezuelan
 uh


tankers,


how
 does
 geopolitics
 factor
 into
 this


market
 here?
 Or
 is
 it
 calming
 down


looking
 to
 2026?


>> Actually,
 you
 know,
 I
 mean,
 obviously
 at


any
 given
 time
 geopolitics
 can
 play
 up


and
 play
 a
 role,
 especially
 when
 you're


talking
 about
 oil,
 which
 is
 a
 political


commodity.
 So,
 you
 you
 want
 to
 keep
 an


eye
 on
 it.
 It's
 one
 of
 our
 themes.
 But


having
 said
 that,
 I
 think
 we
 are


entering
 2026
 at
 probably
 a
 better
 you


know
 geopolitically
 than
 maybe
 2025


where
 we
 had
 a
 new
 administration
 coming


in
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 elections
 uh
 you
 know


from
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 that
 there


was
 this
 Middle
 Eastern
 crisis
 which


seemed


>> I
 would
 agree
 with
 that.
 I
 would
 agree


with
 that.
 I
 think
 geopolitically


entering
 2026
 is
 not
 as
 dicey
 as
 2025.


Now,
 we
 don't
 have
 an
 update
 on
 or
 a


like
 official
 update
 on
 Russia
 Ukraine,


although
 there
 has
 been
 a
 peace
 deal


that
 has
 been
 sent
 out
 and
 Zalinsky


might
 be
 closer
 to
 signing
 it.
 But
 I


mean,
 I
 I
 definitely
 think
 going
 into


2025,
 there
 were
 more
 questions
 than


answers
 around
 geopolitics.
 And
 then
 you


had
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 on
 Friday


also
 said
 the
 report
 from
 Trump
 that


he's
 thinking
 of
 Worsh
 as
 the
 next


Federal
 Reserve
 chair
 over
 Hasset.
 So


Wors
 right
 now
 in
 the
 prediction
 markets


is
 leading
 over
 Hasset.
 And
 you
 know,


Trump
 also
 says
 interest
 rates
 should
 be


1%
 or
 lower.
 I
 don't
 know if
 we're
 going


to
 get
 1%
 rates.
 If
 we
 do,
 this
 market


is
 probably
 going
 higher
 than
 7500,
 but


if
 he
 gets
 a
 Fed
 chair
 that's
 conducive


with
 the
 idea
 of
 getting
 us
 to
 that


level,
 you
 know,
 that
 would
 also
 be


pretty
 pretty
 bullish.
 So,


I
 don't know,
 dude.
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


think
 that
 So,
 here's
 here's
 a
 question


for
 everybody
 else.
 Here's
 a
 question.


Let's
 frame
 it
 like
 this.
 Let's
 say
 we


were
 we
 were
 going
 to
 get
 a
 massive
 pump


into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year,
 right?
 Let's


say


I
 don't
 know,
 let's
 pick
 a
 stock.
 Let's


pick
 um


let's
 pick
 let's
 pick
 Nvidia.
 Let's
 just


pick
 Nvidia
 for
 the
 hell
 of
 it.
 Uh


Nvidia
 200
 by
 end
 of
 year.
 Okay,
 which


means
 if
 Nvidia
 is
 200
 by
 end
 of
 year,


pretty
 much
 everything's
 going
 to
 be


higher,
 right?
 Everything's
 going
 to
 get


a
 big
 move.
 Um


do
 you
 sell
 in
 January?
 not
 sell


everything,
 but
 do
 you
 take
 some
 profits


in
 January
 to
 hedge
 against
 the


volatility?
 Because
 I
 think
 and
 I
 saw
 a


lot
 of
 comments
 in
 the
 chat
 right
 here


that
 said,
 "Man,
 it
 would have
 been
 so


nice
 if
 we
 had
 just
 sold
 at
 the
 top
 in


October."
 Obviously,
 yes,
 it
 would
 have


been
 nice
 because
 it's
 nice
 to
 sell
 the


top.
 But
 if
 the
 market
 gives
 you
 an


opportunity
 again,
 which
 Nvidia
 was


basically
 205
 at
 the
 top
 in
 January
 or


in
 October,
 and
 you
 get
 to
 that
 same


range
 again,
 do
 you
 take
 some
 off
 the


table
 this
 time?
 Do
 you
 take
 some
 off


the
 table?
 Do
 you
 derisk
 a
 little
 bit?


And
 do
 you
 just
 have
 some
 of
 that
 money


in
 cash?
 have
 some
 of
 that
 money
 on
 the


sidelines.
 Have
 some
 of
 that
 money
 get


ready
 to
 buy
 protection
 because
 I
 don't


think
 that's
 the
 craziest
 idea.
 I
 I


wouldn't
 sell
 in
 December.
 Obviously,


everyone
 has
 a
 different
 tax
 situation,


but
 I
 personally
 do
 not
 want
 to
 get
 any


more
 capital
 gains
 going
 into
 December.


Um,
 so
 even
 if
 we
 get
 a
 massive
 run


towards
 the
 end
 of the
 year,
 I'm


definitely
 not
 selling
 anything
 in
 2025.


But
 going
 into
 January,
 even
 if
 you
 get


uh,
 you
 know,
 a
 little
 bit
 less
 of
 a


better
 price
 than
 you
 would
 have
 got
 at


the
 end
 of
 December,


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 crazy
 to
 take
 a


little
 bit
 off
 the
 table.
 And
 and
 and


that
 taking
 a
 little
 bit
 off
 the
 table


is
 just
 hedging
 against
 your
 volatility.


Now,
 getting
 out
 of
 the
 markets,
 I


think,
 is
 stupid
 because
 you
 you're


fighting
 the
 Fed
 at
 that
 point.
 And


maybe
 the
 Fed
 ends
 up
 not
 maybe
 the


stock
 market
 ends
 up
 not
 being
 conducive


with
 the
 Fed,
 which
 historically
 has
 not


happened.
 When
 rates
 go
 up,
 markets
 go


down.
 When
 rates
 go
 down,
 markets
 go
 up.


So,
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 get
 out
 the


markets.
 But
 if
 you
 have
 an
 opportunity


to
 get,
 you
 know,
 Tesla
 at
 500
 or
 Hood


at
 140
 or
 like,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 these


prices
 that
 just
 get
 back
 to
 those


October
 highs,


I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 people
 are
 going


to
 hesitate
 to
 take
 some
 of
 that
 money


off
 the
 table.


The
 question
 is,
 do
 you
 even
 get
 that?


And
 the
 broader
 question
 is,
 is


de-risisking
 something
 that
 makes
 sense?


Especially
 if
 you're
 on
 leverage,
 right?


I
 mean,
 if
 you're
 on
 margin
 with
 a
 lot


of
 this
 stuff,
 like
 then
 I
 think
 it
 even


gives
 you
 a
 better
 opportunity
 to
 just


delever
 and
 not
 get
 super
 greedy
 and


take
 some
 of
 the
 gains.
 See
 a
 decent


amount
 of
 people
 saying
 yes,
 yes,
 100%.


Depends
 on
 taxes.


Yes,
 yes,
 yes,
 sure.
 Swing
 a
 portion.


Yep.
 Yes.
 I
 have
 13,000
 shares.
 I
 would


take
 a
 little
 bit
 off
 the
 table.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 again,
 it
 really
 depends


on
 everyone's
 trajectory
 and
 their
 own


personal
 portfolio,
 but
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 crazy
 because
 because
 then
 the


question
 here
 here's
 the
 thing.
 Let's


say
 we
 pump
 to
 all-time
 highs
 going
 into


the
 end
 of
 December,
 early
 into
 January.


What
 is
 the
 upside,
 right?
 Like
 Nvidia


200
 in
 January.
 Are
 we
 just
 ready
 to


normalize
 200
 and
 our
 upside
 is
 you
 know


220
 230
 and
 then
 we
 just
 keep
 going


higher
 or
 do
 we
 once
 again
 have


something
 stupid
 happen
 like
 a
 shutdown


which
 being
 priced
 at
 35%.
 I
 mean
 that's


not
 an
 insignificant
 odds
 of
 getting
 a


shutdown
 happen
 again
 which
 obviously
 is


going
 to
 affect
 the
 markets
 because
 we


know
 that
 it's
 going to
 affect
 the


markets
 especially
 if
 it's
 uh
 something


that's
 going to
 affect
 GDP
 growth
 which


Q4
 GDP
 already
 ended
 up
 taking
 a
 hit.


Uh,
 and
 then
 you
 get
 these
 asset
 prices


that
 just
 take
 a
 breather,
 especially
 if


we
 don't
 get
 a
 rate
 cut
 until
 June.
 I


mean,
 that
 or
 April.
 I
 mean,
 right
 now


the
 January
 probability
 is
 only
 at
 20%.


April's
 at
 like
 40%.
 But
 they're
 not


guaranteed
 for
 next
 year.
 Now,
 maybe
 the


labor
 market
 data
 is
 bad
 enough
 to
 kind


of
 guarantee
 them.
 But
 if
 if
 they
 don't,


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 crazy
 to
 derisk
 a


little
 bit.


Now,
 getting
 out
 of
 the
 market


completely
 and
 going
 net
 short,
 I
 think


that's
 just
 kind
 of
 dumb.
 I
 I
 I
 think


the
 bears
 are
 way
 too
 cocky
 for
 next


year.
 I
 mean,
 all
 of
 us
 are
 sensing
 a


little
 bit
 of
 weakness
 in
 the
 AI
 trade


just
 from
 the
 exhaustion
 of
 the
 market.


But
 the
 bears
 are
 trying
 to
 fight
 the


Fed
 here.
 They're
 trying
 to
 fight
 the


Fed.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 easily
 fight


the
 Fed,


especially
 a
 dovish
 Fed
 like
 JPAL,


especially
 a
 Fed
 that's
 not
 going
 to


have
 JPAL
 soon.
 So,
 de-risking
 is
 one


thing.
 getting
 out
 of
 the
 market
 and


going
 straight
 cash
 and
 just
 waiting
 for


some
 cataclysmic
 crash.
 That
 I
 think
 is


way
 too
 risky
 because
 and
 here's
 the


other,
 you
 know,
 thing
 that
 that
 makes


it
 very
 hard
 to
 completely
 get
 out
 of


the
 market.
 Earnings
 still
 should
 be


really
 good.
 I
 mean,
 we
 forget
 that
 Q3


earnings
 were
 phenomenal.
 There
 was
 a


handful
 of
 companies
 that
 had
 a
 crappy


earnings.
 Outside
 of
 that,
 every
 single


company,
 I
 mean,
 Oracle
 and
 Broadcom,


even
 if
 their
 earnings
 calls
 weren't


good,
 they
 both
 had
 amazing
 numbers.


make
 T
 yeah
 Tesla
 didn't
 have
 the
 best


numbers
 but
 nonetheless
 Tesla
 is
 Tesla


so
 we
 can't
 we
 can't
 necessarily
 say


Tesla's
 emblematic
 of
 a
 horrible
 earning


cycle
 but
 you
 know
 Tesla's
 making
 a
 lot


of
 actual
 progress
 in
 terms
 of
 getting


what
 they
 need
 to
 get
 into
 the
 real


world
 to
 make
 robot
 taxi
 succeed
 but


Amazon
 Google
 Microsoft
 Meta
 Meta


outside
 of
 that
 whole
 tax
 thing
 and
 the


in
 the
 call
 about
 ROI
 on
 AI
 capex
 all


these
 companies
 just
 Meta
 grew
 26%
 which


is
 insane
 for
 a
 company
 of
 their
 size


crazy


Apple
 is
 guiding
 for
 the
 best
 Q4
 in


history
 at
 12%
 revenue
 growth
 or
 at


least
 in
 the
 last
 5
 years.


So
 I
 think
 another
 natural
 hedge
 to
 the


market
 collapsing
 next
 year
 or
 at least


having
 some
 dramatic
 draw
 down
 is
 like


the
 earnings
 growth
 is
 still
 going
 to
 be


so
 strong
 and
 the
 multiples
 are
 not


inconsistent
 with
 the
 earnings
 growth.


Again,
 Nvidia
 trading
 at
 less
 than
 25


times
 and
 50%
 of
 of
 Walmart
 and
 Costco's


multiple
 is
 not
 euphoria.
 If
 Nvidia
 was


trading
 at
 50
 times
 next
 year,
 then
 I


get
 it.
 like
 yes,
 Nvidia
 is
 susceptible


to
 if
 they
 have
 any
 little
 thing
 that's


an
 issue,
 it's
 coming
 down,
 but
 that's


not
 the
 reality
 of
 what
 we're
 seeing


right
 here.


So,
 I
 do
 think
 earnings
 growth
 should
 be


a
 continued
 hedge


to
 keep
 the
 market
 higher
 as
 well.


Um,


yeah,
 Warren
 Buffett
 is
 gone
 next
 year.


That
 is
 true.
 He
 will
 not
 be
 managing


Birkshshire.
 Dude,
 did
 we
 talk
 about
 the


guy
 who
 left
 Birkshshire
 for
 JP
 Morgan?


Greg
 Ael,
 right?


No,
 Todd
 Combmes.
 Todd.
 Yeah,
 that
 was


that.
 I
 think
 that
 was
 on
 Monday.
 We


talked
 about
 that.
 So,
 Bergkshire
 did


lose
 one
 of
 uh
 one
 of
 their
 core
 fund


managers
 for
 JP
 Morgan.


He's
 going
 to
 be
 leading


a
 strategic
 investment
 group.


Um,
 but
 you
 you
 will
 have
 a
 Birkshshire


that
 doesn't
 lead
 that
 that
 is
 not
 being


led
 by
 Buffett
 and
 Google
 is
 now
 a
 $5


billion
 position
 for
 Birkshshire.
 So


potentially
 a
 new
 life
 cycle
 for


technology
 as
 well.


Was
 there
 Japan
 news
 over
 the
 weekend?
 I


didn't
 see
 any
 major
 Japan
 news.
 The
 big


Japan
 news
 is
 the
 rate
 hike
 that
 is


likely
 happening


on


Tuesday.
 They're
 going
 to
 be
 hiking


rates
 to
 75%
 December
 19th.
 What
 is


that?
 Thursday.
 No,
 Friday.
 Okay,


Friday.
 So,
 yeah,
 the
 street
 already


knows
 it
 though.
 The
 street
 knows
 that


Japan
 is
 going to
 be
 raising
 their


rates.
 So,
 I
 don't
 think
 that's


necessarily


something
 that
 should
 be
 like
 a
 yen


carry
 trade
 2.0
 because
 it
 came
 out
 of


nowhere.
 Remember,
 yen
 carry
 trade,


people
 didn't
 know
 they
 were
 hiking.
 So,


when
 it
 happened,
 immediately
 it
 shot


the
 yen
 up
 and
 then
 people
 had
 to
 sell


to
 cover
 their
 short.
 But
 the
 yen's
 been


shooting
 up
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks


anyway.
 And
 we've
 seen
 the
 effect
 on


Bitcoin
 given
 um
 given
 it's
 fallen
 from


130
 126,000.


So,
 I
 don't
 think


a
 yen
 carry
 trade
 2.0
 happens
 randomly


when
 everyone
 knows
 they're
 they're


cutting
 rates.


So,
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 would
 be
 that
 big


of
 a
 of
 a
 deal.
 The
 Hood
 event
 is
 on


Tuesday.
 That's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 one.


So,
 I
 think
 that's
 at
 5:00
 PM
 Eastern.


So,
 I'll
 be
 streaming
 that
 live.
 It's


going
 to
 be
 about
 prediction
 markets
 and


AI.
 Very,
 very
 excited
 to
 see
 especially


what
 they're
 doing
 in
 prediction


markets.
 Obviously,
 that
 market
 has


grown
 massively
 for
 Robin
 Hood.
 So,
 I


think
 this
 is
 the
 opportunity
 for
 them


to
 take
 advantage
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 the


market's
 going
 so
 fast
 that
 they
 need
 to


really
 push
 out
 innovative
 features
 to


make
 sure
 that
 market
 continues
 to
 grow


for
 them.
 Bitcoin
 right
 here
 89.3


getting
 to
 its
 highest
 level
 of
 the


overnight
 market
 so
 far.
 So,
 yes,
 that's


going
 to
 be
 very
 important
 for
 Hood


going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 uh
 end
 of
 the


year.


China
 retail
 sales
 up
 1.3%


year-over-year.
 China
 November


unemployment
 rate
 5.1%
 matching


expectations.
 China
 fixed
 investment


fell
 2.6%
 yearover-year.


Are
 the
 Chinese
 stocks
 down
 on
 some
 of


those
 stats?


The
 Chinese
 stocks
 are
 down.
 Not
 crazy,


but
 Baba's
 down.
 JD
 is
 down.


That's
 not
 even
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal,


though.
 Unemployment
 is
 in
 line
 with


expectations
 5.1.
 And
 then
 retail
 sales


1.
 Well,
 the
 street
 expected
 3%
 on


retail
 sales.
 So
 that's
 why
 it's
 down.


Yeah,
 Kweb
 should
 be
 down.


That's
 not
 that
 crazy.
 Chinese
 stocks


have
 still
 had
 a
 pretty
 good
 year.
 I


mean,
 BABA
 year
 to
 date
 is
 what,
 like


50%
 year
 to
 date?
 Yeah,
 83%.


China's
 outperformed
 the
 US.
 I
 mean,


pretty
 much
 every
 stock
 market
 has


outperformed
 the
 US
 this
 year,


including


uh
 Japan,


China,
 and
 Europe.


Silver
 and
 gold
 have
 also
 outperformed


the
 US
 this
 year.
 Look
 at
 that.
 Silver


and
 gold
 still
 moving.


But
 it
 goes
 to
 show
 that
 the
 US
 is
 the


center
 of
 the
 AI
 trade
 and
 the
 most


important
 AI
 stocks
 are
 not
 really


trading
 at
 like
 premium
 premium


multiples
 simply
 because
 of
 the
 fear
 of


AI
 which
 again
 is
 bullish
 because
 that's


the
 wall
 of
 worry
 which
 inevitably


allows
 us
 to
 grind
 higher
 over
 time
 but


it's
 also
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 the
 US


is
 not
 outperforming.


How
 is
 India
 doing
 this
 year?
 India.


India's
 definitely
 not
 outperforming
 the


US.
 I
 don't
 think
 so.


Um


yeah,
 the
 Nifty50
 has
 not
 outperforming


the
 US
 this
 year.


Yeah,


US
 is
 smacking
 India.
 India's
 had
 their


own
 political
 issues.
 That's
 not


necessarily
 been
 the
 best,


but


overall
 the
 United
 States
 has
 has
 been


relatively
 strong.
 Bitcoin
 getting
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 move
 right
 here.
 Look
 at


that
 894.
 Same
 with
 ETH.
 It
 was
 at
 3200


on
 Friday.
 Now
 it's
 at
 31.
 So
 we're
 not


that
 far
 away.
 It
 was
 almost
 below
 3,000


this
 morning.


So
 Bitcoin
 right
 there
 at
 894
 and
 then


ETH
 at
 313.


Um,
 okay.
 I
 think
 I
 have
 a
 couple
 of


other
 charts
 I
 wanted
 to
 show.
 Oh
 yeah,


I
 saw
 this
 over
 the
 weekend.
 I've
 never


seen
 this.
 I
 just
 want
 to
 show
 you
 guys


this
 because
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 many


people
 have
 seen
 this,
 but
 this
 randomly


popped
 up
 over
 the
 weekend
 and
 I
 think


it
 was
 just
 crazy
 to
 look
 at.
 We
 talk


about
 GPUs
 and
 chips
 all
 day
 and
 like,


you
 know,
 the
 entire
 world
 is
 revolving


around
 these
 GPUs.
 Take
 a
 look
 at
 this


video
 that
 describes
 what
 an
 Nvidia


Blackwell
 GPU
 actually
 looks
 like.
 I


just
 thought
 this
 was
 fascinating


for
 us
 to
 all
 see
 the
 level
 of


technology
 that's
 being
 created
 and
 all


the
 companies
 that
 are
 mentioned
 in
 this


video
 that
 help
 create
 the
 technology


for
 AI
 to
 actually
 become
 a
 thing.


>> Blackwell
 is
 an
 engineering
 marvel.


It
 begins
 as
 a
 blank
 silicon
 wafer
 at


TSMC.


Hundreds
 of
 chip
 processing
 and


ultraviolet
 lithography
 steps
 build
 up


each
 of
 the
 200
 billion
 transistors


layer
 by
 layer
 on
 a
 12in
 wafer.


The
 wafer
 is
 scribed
 into
 individual


blackwell
 die
 tested
 and
 sorted


separating
 the
 good
 dyes
 to
 move


forward.
 The
 chip
 on
 wafer
 on
 substrate


process
 done
 at
 TSMC
 spill
 and
 amcore


attaches
 32
 Blackwell
 dies
 and
 128
 HBM


stacks
 on
 a
 custom
 silicon
 interposer


wafer.
 Metal
 interconnect
 traces
 are


etched
 directly
 into
 it
 connecting


Blackwell
 GPUs
 and
 HBM
 stacks
 into
 each


system
 and
 package
 unit
 locking


everything
 into
 place.
 Then
 the
 assembly


is
 baked,
 molded,
 and
 cured,
 creating


the
 Blackwell
 B200
 Super
 Chip.
 At
 KYC,


each
 Blackwell
 is
 stress
 tested
 in
 ovens


at
 125°
 C
 and
 pushed
 to
 its
 limits
 for


several
 hours.


Back
 at
 Foxcon,
 robots
 work
 around
 the


clock
 to
 pick
 and
 place
 over
 10.


>> This
 is
 crazy.
 Like
 just
 seeing
 the


level
 of
 technology
 that's
 going
 into


these
 chips
 before
 they
 get
 sold
 to
 the


hyperscalers


is
 just
 wild.
 And
 the
 level
 of


transistors
 and
 the
 the
 trillions
 of


different
 parts
 that
 are
 incorporated


into
 these
 chips.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 just


quite
 phenomenal.
 Back
 at
 Foxcon,
 robots


work
 around
 the
 clock
 to
 pick
 and
 place


over
 10,000
 components
 onto
 the
 Grace


Blackwell
 PCB.


Meanwhile,
 additional
 components
 are


being
 prepared
 at
 factories
 across
 the


globe.
 Custom
 liquid
 cooling
 copper


blocks
 from
 Cooler
 Master,
 ABC,
 ARAS,


and
 Delta
 keep
 the
 chips
 at
 optimal


temperatures.


At
 another
 Foxcon
 facility,
 Connect
 X7


Supernicks
 are
 built
 to
 enable
 scale
 out


communications
 and
 Bluefield
 3DPUs
 to


offload
 and
 accelerate
 networking,


storage,
 and
 security
 tasks.


All
 these
 parts
 converge
 to
 be
 carefully


integrated
 into
 GB200
 compute
 trace.


MVLink
 is
 the
 breakthrough
 high-speed


link
 that
 Nvidia
 invented
 to
 connect


multiple
 GPUs
 and
 scale
 up
 into
 a


massive
 virtual
 GPU.


The
 MVLink
 switch
 tray
 is
 constructed


with
 MVLink
 switch
 chips
 providing
 14.4


terabytes
 per
 second
 of
 all
 to
 all


bandwidth.


MVLink
 spines
 form
 a
 custom
 blindmated


back
 plane
 integrating
 5,000
 copper


cables
 to
 deliver
 130
 tab
 per
 second
 of


allto-all
 bandwidth.
 This
 connects
 all


72
 black
 wells
 or
 144
 GPU
 dies
 into
 one


giant
 GPU.


From
 around
 the
 world,
 parts
 arrive
 from


Foxcon,
 Wistrun,
 Quanta,
 Dell,
 Asus,


Gigabyte,
 HPE,
 Super
 Micro,
 and
 other


partners
 to
 be
 assembled
 by
 skilled


technicians
 into
 a
 rack
 scale
 AI


supercomput.
 In
 total,
 1.2
 million


components,
 2
 miles
 of
 copper
 cable,


130
 trillion
 transistors,
 weighing
 1,800


kg.


From
 the
 first
 transistor
 etched
 into
 a


wafer
 to
 the
 last
 bolt
 fastening
 the


Blackwell
 rack,
 every
 step
 carries
 the


weight
 of
 our
 partners'
 dedication,


precision,
 and
 craft.


Blackwell
 is
 more
 than
 a
 technological


wonder.
 It's
 a
 testament
 to
 the
 marvel


of
 the
 Taiwan
 technology
 ecosystem.


So
 when
 you
 ask
 an
 LLM
 a
 question,
 it's


going
 back
 to
 that
 thing
 that
 we
 just


saw
 in
 order
 to
 give
 us
 an
 answer.
 Like


that's
 it's
 crazy,
 dude.
 And
 that's
 just


Blackwell.
 We
 got
 Ver
 Rubin
 coming
 up


next
 year,
 which
 is
 going
 to
 be


supposedly
 much
 faster
 and
 even
 more


advanced
 than
 than
 Grace
 Blackwell
 right


now.
 I
 it's
 just
 sometimes
 when
 you
 see


stuff
 like
 that,
 you
 remember
 that,
 you


know,
 we're
 we're
 sort
 of
 like
 ab


abstractly
 discussing
 Nvidia
 chip
 sales


and
 like
 AMD
 and
 A6,
 but
 like
 the
 actual


real
 technology
 and
 the
 hard
 work
 that


goes
 into
 building
 that
 stuff
 and
 then


Nvidia
 somehow
 inks
 out
 a
 73%
 margin
 on


all
 of
 that.


It
 goes
 to
 show
 you
 how
 incredible
 of
 a


company
 they
 are
 and
 how
 much
 pricing


power
 they
 have.
 Same
 thing
 with


Broadcom
 and
 AMD,
 right?
 Like
 the


ability
 for
 them
 to
 actually
 generate


revenue
 and
 profits
 on
 what
 is
 very
 very


complex
 supply
 chains.
 It
 also
 shows
 you


how
 it's
 not
 that
 easy
 for
 it
 to
 be


replicated
 and
 as
 bullish
 as
 TPUs
 are


for
 Google
 to
 be
 able
 to
 replicate
 that


type
 of
 supply
 chain
 at
 scale
 and
 then


deliver
 it
 to
 millions
 millions
 of


customers


is
 just
 not
 the
 easiest
 thing.


But
 that's
 what
 Nvidia
 is
 doing
 and


hopefully
 that
 continues
 to
 to
 scale.


But
 yeah,
 then
 Bur
 comes
 out
 and
 says


depreciation


Then
 it
 all
 becomes
 and
 then
 the
 market


falls
 a
 trillion
 in
 market
 go.
 That's


that's
 what
 also
 makes
 it
 funny.
 It's


like
 you
 see
 that
 in
 front
 of
 you
 and


then
 you
 have
 a
 guy
 that
 says,
 "Yeah,


but
 depreciation."
 And
 then
 boom,


market's
 like,
 "Yeah,
 none
 of
 it's
 real


anyway."


Which
 again,
 I
 think
 are
 just
 going
 to


be
 opportunities
 for
 us
 long
 term
 as


well.
 Do
 you
 ever
 think
 about
 the


implications
 to
 the
 environment
 with
 all


this
 AI
 build
 electricity
 prices?
 Uh,
 I


think
 there's
 going to
 be
 implications


for
 a
 lot
 of
 things.
 Obviously,


electricity
 prices
 for
 people's
 home


bills
 is
 one
 thing.
 There's
 probably


going
 to
 be
 environmental
 concerns.
 Um,


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 think
 with
 the


environment,
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 comes
 down
 to


capitalism
 in
 general
 and
 the
 necessity


of
 growth
 is
 always
 going
 to
 be
 at
 odds


with
 the
 philosophical
 desires
 of
 people


who
 want
 to
 keep
 the
 environment
 safe
 or


not
 necessarily


affected
 by
 greenhouse
 gas
 emissions.


And
 so


I
 don't know.
 I
 I
 just
 philosophically
 I


don't
 see
 how
 in
 a
 capitalist
 economy
 we


can
 meaningfully
 say
 we
 care
 about
 the


environment
 when
 in
 order
 to
 grow
 the


environment
 is
 going
 to
 have
 to
 like
 in


order
 to
 ship
 the
 parts
 from
 Taiwan
 to


Foxcon
 in
 in
 one
 of
 the
 Foxcon
 factories


in
 the
 United
 States.
 You
 have
 to
 put


them
 on
 a
 plane.
 On
 the
 plane
 there
 has


to
 release
 greenhouse
 gas
 emissions.


when
 it
 gets
 to
 the
 factory,
 the
 factory


has
 to
 also
 use
 energy
 to
 make
 the
 part.


Like,
 how
 do
 you
 put
 a
 limit
 on
 that?


What's
 the
 bright
 line
 on
 that?
 How
 do


you
 philosophically
 say
 what
 we're


allowed
 to
 have
 a
 bright
 line
 on
 or
 not


allowed
 to
 have
 a
 bright
 light
 on?
 And


then
 if
 you
 arbitrarily
 say,
 "All
 right,


we're
 not
 allowed
 to
 grow
 this
 much."


And
 the
 economy
 goes
 down,
 we're
 going


to
 have
 a
 lot
 bigger
 concern
 about


people
 and
 their
 ability
 to
 survive
 if


the
 economy
 goes
 down.
 And
 that's
 going


to
 be a
 different
 environmental


challenge
 if
 people,
 you
 know,
 can't


afford
 to
 pay
 their
 bills.


So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 It's
 not
 even
 that
 I'm


not
 sympathetic
 about
 the
 environmental


concerns.
 I'm
 I
 I
 I've
 just
 kind
 of


decided
 a
 long
 time
 ago
 that
 capitalism


and
 the
 idea
 of
 growth
 is
 incompatible


with
 trying
 to
 be
 saving
 the
 environment


because
 you
 need
 to
 grow
 to
 save
 the


environment.
 Like
 this
 YouTube
 stream
 is


using
 energy
 from
 a
 data
 center
 right


now
 that's
 hurting
 the
 environment.
 So


is
 YouTube
 supposed
 to
 say,
 "Hey,
 you


can't
 stream."
 Well,
 that's
 going
 to


hurt
 Google's
 business.
 If
 that
 hurts


Google's
 business,
 that's
 going
 to
 hurt


people's
 retirement
 accounts
 that
 have


Google
 stock.
 And
 it's
 it's
 a
 very


convoluted
 system
 that
 you
 end
 up
 on
 one


side
 or
 the
 other,
 but
 I
 think
 the


growth
 side
 for
 capitalism
 seems
 to
 be


the
 better
 side,


even
 though
 it
 obviously
 can
 still


affect
 the
 environment.


Um,


Google,
 oh,
 speaking
 of
 Google,
 yes,


Google
 did
 get
 a
 very
 nice
 return
 on


SpaceX.
 Next.
 Uh,
 so
 because
 SpaceX


completed
 the
 offering
 at
 800
 billion,


Google's
 going
 to
 print
 probably
 another


40%
 EPS
 like
 they
 did
 two
 quarters
 ago


on
 their
 SpaceX
 stock.
 So,
 uh,
 pretty


bullish
 for
 Google
 based
 on
 what's
 going


on
 with
 SpaceX.


And
 next
 quarter,


it
 looks
 like
 if
 this
 SpaceX
 thing
 is


official,
 then
 yeah,
 Google's
 going
 to


have
 another
 massive
 EPS
 as
 they
 hold
 a


I
 think
 it's
 like
 a
 50
 billion
 $50


billion
 stake
 now
 in
 SpaceX.


which
 is
 I
 think
 about
 9%.


And
 pretty
 incredible.
 Uh
 retail
 sales


data
 Tuesday,
 jobs
 report
 Tuesday,
 CPI


for
 November,
 Thursday,
 PCE
 on
 Friday,


existing
 home
 sales
 on
 Friday,
 and
 then


we
 get
 consumer
 sentiment
 and
 Michigan


inflation
 expectations
 on
 Friday.
 So,
 we


do
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 macro
 data
 this
 week.
 I


think
 the
 CPI
 on
 Thursday
 and
 the
 jobs


report
 on
 Tuesday
 are
 going
 to
 be
 the


most
 important
 things
 that
 we
 have
 to


look
 for.


Um,
 but
 those
 are
 going
 to
 be
 kind
 of


the
 the
 main
 metrics


that
 at
 least
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 looking


for
 and
 hopefully,
 you
 know,
 they
 don't


disappoint.
 If
 CPI
 comes
 in
 better
 than


expected,
 that's
 bullish.
 If
 the
 labor


market
 is
 okay
 but
 not
 horrible,
 then


that's
 also
 bullish
 because
 we're


probably
 still
 going
 to
 get
 a
 rate
 cut,


but
 hopefully
 that
 doesn't
 hurt
 earnings


growth
 if
 more
 people
 are


unemployed.


When
 in
 2026
 would
 they
 go
 public?
 Okay.


So,
 that
 has
 not
 been
 disclosed,
 but
 it


has
 been
 reported
 widely
 that
 they're


definitely
 going
 public.
 I
 don't
 know.


When
 do
 you
 guys
 think
 they
 should
 go


public?
 I
 think
 they
 should
 do
 it
 as


quick
 as
 possible
 because
 you
 don't
 know


what
 could
 happen
 in
 the
 market
 cycle.


Right
 now,
 it's
 hot.
 People
 want
 to
 own


SpaceX.
 Retail
 is
 going
 to
 bid
 the
 hell


up
 out
 of
 it.
 I
 mean,
 you
 definitely


shouldn't
 do
 it
 after
 we
 have
 like
 a
 10


15%
 decline
 if
 we
 end
 up
 having
 that.


So,
 I
 I
 would
 I
 would
 say
 they
 need
 to


do
 it
 as
 soon
 as
 possible.


like
 February,
 March,
 they
 should
 go
 for


it.
 They
 should
 go
 for
 it
 when
 people


have
 the
 money
 to
 spend.
 And
 right
 now


people
 have
 money.
 Yeah,
 it
 said
 800


billion.
 So
 the
 tender
 offer
 was
 was
 uh


800
 billion,
 not
 1.5
 trillion,
 which


look
 is
 more
 reasonable.
 Bloomberg
 said


1.5
 trillion
 on
 Wednesday.
 I
 was
 like,


there's
 no
 way
 in
 hell.
 Like
 they
 you


cannot
 have
 a
 $1.5
 trillion
 IPO.
 Now


maybe
 it's
 above
 800
 billion,
 but
 the


tender
 offer
 this
 weekend
 was
 at
 800


billion.
 So
 if
 the
 IPO
 ultimately
 is


going
 to
 be
 800
 850
 that's
 more


reasonable
 than
 1.5
 at
 1.5
 trillion
 I


think
 you
 have
 zero
 upside
 at least
 in


the
 short
 term
 at
 800
 billion
 I
 mean


this
 thing
 going
 to
 a
 trillion
 seems


kind
 of
 inevitable
 the
 day
 of
 IPO
 simply


because
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 it's
 going to


get
 pumped
 now
 does
 it
 stay
 there
 who


knows
 but
 at
 least
 there
 is
 some
 baked


in
 upside


so
 I
 think
 they
 should
 do
 it
 like
 very


soon


right
 after
 the
 tariff
 stimulus
 are
 we


still
 getting
 our
 STEMI
 checks


Are
 we
 still
 getting
 any
 tariffs
 demi


checks?


It
 would
 be
 nice
 to
 to
 get
 those
 even


though
 I'm
 not
 getting
 it.
 I
 think
 a
 lot


of
 people
 in
 the
 chat
 are
 probably
 not


getting
 it
 either.


But
 uh
 yeah,
 I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 we're
 getting
 our
 tariff


stemmies.


Trump
 did
 talk
 about
 tariffs
 over
 the


weekend
 and
 he's
 happy
 that
 they
 brought


in
 a
 lot
 of
 money,
 which
 they
 have.


But
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that
 means
 that


money


is
 going
 into
 a
 $2,000
 stim
 check


>> to
 an
 extent
 because
 without
 the


November
 5th
 election,
 you
 would
 have


had
 a
 president
 that
 didn't
 have
 the


courage
 to
 use
 tariffs
 the
 way
 they


should
 be
 used.
 And
 because
 of
 the


tariffs,
 we've
 taken
 in
 more
 than
 18,


think
 of
 this,
 $18
 trillion.
 There's


never
 been
 anything
 like
 it
 as
 to
 an


extent.


>> I
 don't
 think
 it
 means
 18
 trillion
 in


revenue
 because
 revenue
 is
 about
 350


billion.
 Um,
 I
 think
 he's
 talking
 about


overall
 investment
 of
 18
 trillion.


I
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 the
 18
 trillion


number
 comes
 from,
 but
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 direct
 revenue.
 So,


yeah,
 I
 think
 he
 means
 the
 deals
 that


we've
 had
 because
 of
 the
 uh
 the


trillions
 in
 tariffs
 or
 the
 the
 the
 bill


the
 the
 deals
 from
 the
 tariffs
 that
 have


resulted
 in
 trillions
 of
 of
 investment.


But
 yeah,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 those
 $2,000


uh
 checks
 are
 going
 to
 be
 put
 out
 there.


Here's
 a
 here's
 an
 idea
 I
 also
 want
 to


float
 by
 people.
 This
 is
 super
 random,


but
 I
 saw
 this
 over
 the
 weekend.
 I


thought
 it
 was
 compelling.
 I'm
 going to


put
 it
 out
 there.
 I'm
 not
 taking
 this


trade,
 but
 I
 do
 think
 there
 is
 an


argument
 right
 here.
 Um,
 Snappy
 Chat,


Snappy
 Chat,
 Snappy
 Chat,
 Snappy
 Chat.


Here's
 what
 Snapchat
 is
 doing.
 Now,
 if


you
 have
 over
 five
 gigabytes
 of
 memory


in
 your
 Snap
 folder,


you
 now
 have
 to
 pay
 $2
 a
 month
 to


Snapchat
 for
 them
 to
 hold
 all
 your


storage.


Now,
 that
 sounds
 like
 it's
 not
 that
 big


of
 a
 deal,
 but
 when
 you
 think
 about
 it,


and
 I
 thought
 this
 analysis
 was
 pretty


reasonable,
 uh
 they
 say
 the
 vast


majority
 of
 their
 users,
 they
 have
 about


a
 billion
 users,
 have
 over
 5
 gigabytes


of
 data
 in
 their
 saved
 memories.
 They


just
 rolled
 out
 an
 ultimatum
 of
 you


either
 pay
 $3
 a
 month
 for
 storage
 or
 and


this
 is
 the
 big
 part.
 You
 lose
 all
 your


memories.
 Now
 I
 have
 Snapchat.
 I
 have a


lot of
 memories
 from
 college.
 I
 don't


think
 I
 have
 anywhere
 near
 5
 gigabytes.


I
 I
 have
 to
 check
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 I


have
 that
 much.
 I
 will
 say
 there
 is


there
 are
 certain
 random
 days
 where
 I
 go


back
 into
 my
 memories.
 I
 think
 like
 a


lot
 of
 people
 and
 you
 kind
 of
 see
 some


of
 the
 stuff
 in
 in
 your
 Snapchat
 folder,


right?
 It's
 different
 from
 your
 camera


roll
 because
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 it's
 on
 your


like
 actual
 Snapchat
 app
 and
 you
 don't


want
 to
 lose
 those
 memories
 just
 like


you
 don't
 want
 to
 lose
 like
 your


playlist
 on
 Spotify.
 Even
 if
 you
 don't


listen
 to
 those
 playlists
 anymore,
 you


don't
 want
 to
 lose
 those
 memories.
 So
 if


you
 assume
 just
 10%
 of
 DAUs,
 which
 would


be
 about
 40
 million
 people
 pay
 this,


that
 gets
 you
 about
 600
 million
 of
 an


instant
 boost
 to
 IBIDA
 and
 free
 cash


flow.
 And
 so
 even
 if
 you
 don't
 use


Snapchat
 anymore,
 but
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of


photos
 in
 there,
 it
 does
 seem
 like
 this


$3
 tier
 on
 a
 10%
 DAU


uh
 uh
 ratio
 adopting
 it
 would
 print
 them


a
 couple
 billion
 dollars
 extra
 of


revenue
 per
 year
 and
 about
 a
 half
 a


billion
 in
 free
 cash
 flow.
 Now,
 yes,
 uh


people
 saying,
 "Can't
 you
 just
 download


it
 immediately
 into
 your
 uh
 into
 your


camera
 roll?"
 Yeah,
 you
 could,
 right?


Like
 this
 is
 this
 is
 really
 stupid.
 I'm


just
 bringing
 it
 up
 because
 I
 saw
 it


over
 the
 weekend
 and
 I'm
 like,
 it
 does


make
 me
 think
 a
 little
 bit.
 How
 many


people
 would
 see
 that
 and
 get
 so
 scared


that
 they're
 going
 to
 lose
 their


memories
 that
 they
 would
 take
 the
 time


to
 individually
 download
 like
 50


gigabytes
 of
 their
 college
 years
 on


Snapchat
 into
 their
 iPhone.
 I
 mean,


maybe
 people
 will
 do
 that.
 I
 would
 do


that
 if
 I
 have
 like
 six
 gigabytes
 of


memories
 and
 I'm
 a
 gigabyte
 above
 the
 5


gigabyte
 limit.
 But
 if
 you
 have
 like
 a


100
 gigabytes
 where
 there
 are
 some
 you


power
 users
 of
 Snapchat
 that
 just
 love


using
 it,
 you
 would
 just
 pay
 the
 two


bucks
 a
 month,
 right?
 or
 the
 three
 bucks


a
 month.
 Like
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 that
 big
 of


a
 deal,
 especially
 if
 you're
 a
 mo
 like


if
 Spotify
 increased
 their
 their
 their


their
 um
 their
 subscription
 by
 a
 couple


bucks
 and
 you
 you
 your
 all
 of
 your
 music


memories
 are
 stored
 in
 Spotify


playlists,
 you're
 probably
 paying
 the


extra
 couple
 bucks.
 So,
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 that
 crazy
 to
 imagine
 that


consumers,
 Bitcoin
 right
 here
 trying
 to


get
 back
 to
 90,000
 would
 pay
 for
 that.
 I


wonder
 if
 it
 would
 have
 a
 meaningful


impact
 on
 Snap's
 bottom
 line.
 Snapchat


right
 there
 up
 about
 1%
 overnight.
 The


funny
 thing
 about
 this
 as
 well
 is
 this


is
 all
 marketing
 because
 there's
 no
 way


in
 hell
 that
 Snapchat's
 cloud
 computing


costs
 are
 getting
 to
 the
 point
 where


they
 need
 to
 limit
 users
 memories
 and


storage.
 I
 mean
 cloud
 computing
 and
 and


like
 AWS
 S3
 storage
 for
 these
 tech


companies
 is
 is
 pennies.
 And
 the
 ROI


they
 get
 from
 people
 using
 the
 product


over
 and
 over
 which
 is
 why
 they
 give


them
 unlimited
 storage
 on
 Facebook
 and


Google
 etc.
 Google's
 a
 little
 different


with
 Google
 Drive,
 but
 Facebook's
 never


really
 charged
 you
 for
 store
 because


Facebook
 knows
 the
 more
 you
 keep


posting,
 we
 can
 handle
 the
 the
 the
 the


little
 megabytes
 of
 your
 photos,
 but
 the


advertising
 revenue
 we
 make
 of
 you
 keep


posting
 photos,
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 stop.


So,
 this
 is
 not
 like
 Snapchat
 has
 to


charge
 people
 three
 bucks
 a
 month


because
 they're
 like
 trying
 to
 get
 more


efficient
 on
 their
 cloud
 storage
 costs.


This
 is
 like
 just
 I
 think
 a
 gimmick
 to


to
 find
 a
 new
 form
 of
 revenue
 and
 it's


relatively
 smart
 in
 my
 opinion.
 I
 just


wonder
 if
 there's
 a
 trade
 to
 be
 made


there.
 But
 I
 feel
 like
 we
 need
 more
 data


on
 how
 many
 people
 would
 actually


convert


because
 you
 know
 if
 you
 take
 that
 trade


on
 that
 thesis
 you
 would
 need
 a
 really


good
 hunch
 that
 hundreds
 of
 mill
 at


least
 tens
 of
 millions
 of
 people
 would


pay
 that
 stupid
 three
 bucks
 a
 month.
 And


what
 gives
 me
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 of
 of
 of


of
 uh
 sympathy
 for
 that
 argument
 is
 that


Snapchat
 has
 this
 like
 Snapchat
 AI


product,
 which
 is
 also
 like
 five
 bucks
 a


month.
 They
 have
 7
 million
 people
 paying


for
 it.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 7
 million


teenagers
 use
 their
 parents
 credit
 card


to
 pay
 for
 some
 Snapchat
 AI
 bot
 that


they
 could
 use
 Chat
 for
 free
 for,
 but


they're
 paying
 for
 it.
 So
 you
 might
 just


have
 a
 lot
 of
 kids
 that
 just
 say,
 "Oh
 my


god,
 I'm
 going to
 lose
 my
 memories.
 I


need
 to
 pay
 for
 this."
 And
 then
 they
 end


up
 paying
 the
 three
 bucks
 a
 month
 and


then
 boom,
 that's
 what
 ends
 up


happening.
 Bitcoin
 90K,
 Ethereum
 3100.


Now
 we're
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of
 a


bigger
 move
 after
 hours.
 Tesla
 up
 1%,


S&P
 up.3,
 Apple's
 up
 1
 point
 or
 0.14,


Palanteer
 just
 went
 green,
 Nvidia's
 up


almost
 one.
 Hoodie
 at
 120.5.
 Even


Broadcom
 still
 red
 but
 not
 as
 red
 as
 it


was
 before.
 Disney's
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 as


well.
 Rocket
 Lab
 nice
 move
 3%
 right


here.
 So
 you
 are
 getting


the
 futures
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 love.


68333


on
 the
 S&P.


I
 don't
 know.
 Would
 people
 pay
 for
 the


memories
 for
 Snapchat?
 Let
 me
 check


mine.
 I
 don't
 even
 think
 I
 qualify
 to


pay
 for
 this
 much.


Yeah,
 there's
 no
 way
 I
 have
 5
 gigabytes


of
 I
 mean,
 I
 stopped
 using
 this
 thing


years
 ago.


So,


but
 I
 could
 imagine
 some
 kids
 just
 freak


out
 because
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 lose


their
 memories
 and
 then
 boom,
 they


freaking
 uh


they
 just
 pay
 for
 it.


On
 December
 14th,
 seven
 years
 ago,
 I
 was


in
 a
 library


studying
 for
 finals


with
 Starbucks.


Ironically,
 I
 had
 Starbucks
 today.


Actually
 got
 hot
 chocolate
 for
 the
 first


time
 in
 a
 while.


Mr.
 Hot
 chocolate's
 not
 that
 bad.
 It's


not
 that
 bad.
 Um,


it's
 actually
 a
 smart
 idea.
 I
 agree
 it's


smart.
 I
 just
 wonder
 how
 many
 people


would
 pay.


Bob
 says,
 "I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 memories
 on


Snapchat
 stuff
 I
 find
 valuable."


Yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 there
 are
 some


people
 that
 would
 would
 end
 up
 paying


for
 it.


Um,


bullish
 SoFi
 on
 the
 student
 loan
 stuff.


Yes,
 I
 think.


Look,
 the
 the
 SoFi,
 I
 mean,
 there's
 been


some
 rumors
 about
 the
 federal
 government


potentially
 offloading
 a
 lot
 of
 their


private
 loans
 to
 SoFi
 as
 well.
 That


would
 be
 a
 massive
 catalyst
 for
 SoFi.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 that's
 going
 to
 happen.


Maybe
 that's
 the
 reason
 they
 raised
 1.5


billion
 in
 debt
 because
 they're
 getting


ready
 to
 handle
 a
 ton
 more
 loan


originations
 with
 student
 loans.
 I
 mean,


we
 still
 don't
 have
 a
 real
 reason
 why


they
 raised
 that
 money.
 So
 if
 I
 right


there
 2733
 after
 hours,


but
 I'm
 hoping
 Notto
 has
 somewhat
 of
 a


plan
 for
 this.


All right,
 I
 think
 that's
 pretty
 much


it.
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 have
 any
 other


crazy
 headlines
 today.


Be
 very
 curious
 to
 see
 what
 we
 get
 going


into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 uh


the
 year.
 And
 these
 are
 the
 last
 two


weeks
 of
 the
 year.
 These
 are
 supposed
 to


be
 the
 most
 bullish
 two
 weeks
 of
 the


year,
 folks.
 So,
 these
 are
 the
 two
 weeks


where


if
 we're
 making
 a
 run
 for
 it,


we're
 going
 to
 see
 if
 we
 actually
 make


this
 run.
 What
 do
 I
 think
 of
 Camila's


thesis
 on
 Bloom?
 I
 know
 he
 did
 a
 podcast


on
 it
 over
 the
 weekend.
 I
 have
 not


watched
 it
 yet.
 So,
 that
 is
 on
 my
 list


because
 I
 do
 want
 to
 look
 at
 Bloom.
 I


know
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 like
 that
 ticker.


A
 lot
 of
 the
 energy
 stocks
 took
 a


beating
 on
 on
 that
 OpenAI
 data
 center


news.
 But
 yeah,
 I
 will
 uh
 I
 was
 actually


texting
 with
 Camilo
 over
 the
 weekend.
 So


I
 will
 I
 will
 listen
 to
 that
 Bloom


podcast.


Uh
 Derer
 says,
 "Congrats
 on
 expanding


your
 team.
 Did
 you
 get
 bombarded
 with


emails
 after
 Friday
 stream?"
 Yes,
 got
 a


ton
 of
 new
 emails.
 Ton
 of
 you
 guys


signed
 up
 for
 the
 meetup.
 So
 very
 very


excited
 for
 that.
 Again,
 I'll
 put
 the


link
 right
 here
 in
 the
 chat.
 Um
 I'm


excited
 for
 it,
 dude.
 I
 have
 finally
 put


in
 some
 actual
 structure


and
 organization
 to
 managing
 my
 life


outside
 of
 just
 doing
 everything
 on
 my


own.
 And
 yeah,
 I
 think it's
 needed.
 It's


time,
 dude.
 There's
 just
 like
 just
 a
 lot


of
 stuff
 going
 into
 next
 year.
 Like
 a


lot
 of
 planning,
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 ways


to
 take
 things
 to
 the
 next
 level.
 And


just
 having
 some
 support
 there
 is


really,
 really
 important.
 And
 also


having
 some
 support
 with
 someone
 you


actually
 want
 to
 work
 with
 and
 that
 can


be
 part
 of
 the
 community.


I
 think
 is
 really
 important.
 So,
 um,


most
 likely,
 guys,
 I
 will
 be
 at
 CES
 in


January.
 So,
 Vegas,
 I
 will
 be
 there.


We're
 not
 going
 to
 do
 a
 meet
 up
 or


anything,
 but
 at least
 not
 yet
 in
 Vegas,


but
 I
 will
 be
 there.
 So,
 we'll
 have
 some


CES
 stuff
 to
 do.
 Never
 been
 to
 CES


before,
 so
 it'll
 be
 my
 first
 time.
 And,


uh,
 shout
 out
 to
 Nvidia.
 They
 I
 didn't


know
 they
 were
 going
 to
 do
 this
 at
 all,


but
 they
 they
 ended
 up
 posting
 a
 snippet


of
 my
 clip
 on
 the
 official
 Nvidia


account
 with
 the
 podcast
 I
 did
 uh
 with


Justin
 and
 Kevin.
 Justin
 from
 Nvidia,


Kevin
 from
 Pounder.
 This
 is
 one
 of


Jensen's
 30
 direct
 reports.
 And
 then


Kevin
 leads
 sales
 of
 Pounder.
 So,
 this


was
 super
 cool
 to
 see.


And
 so,
 yeah,
 just
 got
 a
 lot
 a
 lot
 of


work
 going
 into
 next
 year,


but
 we
 got
 to
 keep
 grinding.


We've
 got
 to
 keep
 grinding.


I'm
 sure
 I'll
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 at


CES
 as
 well.
 There's
 It's
 a
 pretty
 big


event,
 dude.
 It's
 like
 tens
 and
 tens
 of


thousands
 of
 people
 that
 ended
 up
 going


there.


Are
 you
 going
 to
 interview
 Jensen?
 Not


at
 CES,
 but
 hopefully
 eventually.
 I'm


trying.
 I
 am
 trying.
 I
 think
 I
 think
 we


can
 get
 Jensen
 next
 year.
 I
 don't
 know


how
 it's
 going
 to
 happen
 or
 when
 it's


going
 to
 happen.
 Um,


but
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 shot.
 So,
 it'
 be


very
 very
 cool
 if
 we
 could
 uh
 if
 we


could
 get
 Mr.
 Jensen,


that'd
 be
 just
 awesome,
 dude.
 To
 talk
 to


some
 like
 just
 for
 him
 to
 be
 alive


during
 this
 lifetime
 and
 to
 to
 get
 a


glimpse
 of
 how
 he
 thinks
 about
 the
 world


because
 you
 hear
 it
 from
 all
 these
 other


people,
 but
 like
 actually
 getting
 to
 sit


down
 and
 talk
 with
 them.


He
 already
 has
 it
 scheduled.
 He's


trolling.
 I
 actually
 don't.
 I
 really


don't.


part
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 I'm
 going
 to
 CES


is
 to,
 you
 know,
 get
 closer
 into
 this


Nvidia
 ecosystem
 and
 hopefully
 maybe


that
 gets
 us
 a
 chance
 to
 interview


Jensen.
 But
 I
 also
 I
 want
 to
 see
 the
 new


tech
 at
 CES.
 I
 mean,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 this
 is
 the
 stuff
 we're
 investing


in
 and
 so
 I
 know
 Nvidia
 is
 going to
 have


a
 booth
 there.
 A
 lot
 of
 these
 tech


companies,
 semiconductor
 companies
 going


to
 have
 booths
 there.
 So,
 it'll
 just
 be


really
 cool
 to
 see
 all
 that
 in
 person.


But
 that'll
 be
 really
 fun
 to
 uh
 to
 talk


to
 him.


buy
 a
 GB200.
 I
 should
 do
 that.
 I
 should


do
 that.


All right,
 I
 think
 that's
 it.
 I
 think


that's
 what
 we
 got.
 Um,


nothing
 else
 too
 crazy
 for
 this
 week.
 Do


we
 We
 don't
 have
 any
 earnings
 this
 week,


right?
 No,
 we
 do.
 We
 have
 FedEx
 and
 we


have
 Nike.
 Yeah,
 then
 Nike
 insider
 buy


the
 other
 day.
 Million
 bucks.
 So,
 maybe


that's
 a
 signal.
 And
 then
 Micron.
 Nike,


FedEx,
 and
 Micron.
 Carnival
 Cruise
 as


well.


Nike,
 FedEx,
 Micron,
 and
 Carnival


Cruise.


And
 those
 are
 going
 to
 be
 the
 ones
 that


we'll
 look
 at
 this
 week.


Chris's
 channel,
 let
 me
 put
 it
 right


here.
 It's
 Dumb
 Money.
 That's
 their


latest
 podcast,
 right?
 Their
 latest


podcast,
 I
 think,
 was
 Bloom
 Energy.
 So,


yeah,
 here's
 the
 link
 to
 that
 if
 anyone


wants
 to
 watch
 it,


but
 this
 will
 be
 one
 to
 to
 take
 a
 look


at.
 Any
 meetups
 in
 Boston?
 So,
 we
 did


Boston
 last
 year.
 Uh,
 we
 might
 do
 it


again
 this
 year.
 I
 think
 the
 next
 one,


which
 we're
 already
 started
 planning


after,
 um,
 New
 York
 is
 going to
 be
 LA.


So,
 for
 all
 my
 LA
 folks,
 trying
 to
 make


that
 happen
 hopefully
 end
 of
 March
 and


we'll
 have
 updates
 on
 that
 soon.
 But,


yeah,
 Los
 Angeles
 seems
 like
 the
 next


one
 after
 New
 York.
 And,
 uh,
 we
 did


PaloAlto
 last
 year,
 so
 I
 kind
 of
 want
 to


do
 LA
 this
 time
 because
 we
 already
 did


the
 Bay
 Area,
 even
 though
 I
 love
 the
 Bay


Area.
 Probably
 will
 be
 there
 again
 soon.


But


when's
 the
 last
 time
 I've
 been
 to
 LA?


Like
 I
 don't
 know.
 When's
 the
 last
 time


I
 went
 to
 LA
 for
 fun?


I
 think
 it's
 been
 a
 while.
 I've
 been
 to


the
 Bay
 Area
 a
 bunch,
 but
 LA
 it's
 been
 a


minute.
 We
 will
 definitely
 do
 Toronto.


Definitely
 make
 Toronto
 happen.


Um
 Toronto's
 also
 close,
 so
 it's
 easy
 to


do
 that.


But
 we
 did
 Toronto
 this
 year
 as
 well.


So,
 it's
 not
 like
 we
 didn't
 didn't
 do


that
 one.


LA
 should
 be
 fun,
 though.
 LA
 is
 LA's


always
 a
 fun
 time.
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 could


ever
 live
 in
 Los
 Angeles,
 though.


Although,
 for
 those
 people
 in
 the


Northeast,
 at
 least
 in
 New
 Jersey,
 New


York.


So,
 last
 night
 before
 I
 went
 to
 sleep,
 I


looked
 outside.
 I
 was
 like,
 it
 was


snowing
 a
 little.
 I
 was
 like,
 "Wow,
 we


got
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 snow."
 Like,
 we


haven't
 seen
 snow
 in
 a
 This
 morning
 we


woke
 up
 six
 inches
 pure.
 And
 I'm
 just


like,
 I
 know
 six
 answers
 is
 not
 crazy,


but
 still
 like
 we
 haven't
 seen
 that
 much


snow
 in
 a
 long
 time.
 And
 as
 much
 as
 I


love
 the
 Northeast,
 I
 am
 so
 done
 with


the
 snow.
 I
 am
 so
 done
 with
 the
 cold.


Like
 the
 cold
 is
 just
 inconvenient.
 It's


just
 inconvenient.
 Like
 it
 just
 feels


worse
 when
 it's
 cold.
 And
 I
 really
 love


the
 Northeast
 for
 the
 for
 the


seasonality.
 And
 I
 I
 kind
 of,
 you
 know,


like
 that
 it
 changes
 the
 seasons.
 But
 I


also
 am
 starting
 to
 hate
 it.
 Like


genuinely,
 I'm
 starting
 to
 hate
 it.
 And


I'd
 rather
 just
 like
 be
 somewhere
 that's


warm
 all
 the
 time.


So,


I
 don't
 know
 if
 like
 I
 would
 ever
 move


anytime
 soon
 because
 I
 I
 just
 love
 New


York
 City
 too
 much
 and
 being
 close
 to


it,
 but
 I
 hate
 the
 cold.
 Like,
 I'm
 not
 a


fan
 of
 it
 anymore.


It's
 not
 fun
 for
 it
 to
 be
 cold.


65
 today
 in
 San
 Diego.
 Yeah.
 Like,


San
 Diego,
 that's
 beautiful.
 Like
 how


amazing
 would
 it
 be
 to
 wake
 up
 every


morning


and
 be
 in
 San
 Diego?


>> No,
 Houston
 gets
 too
 hot.
 That's
 you


guys.
 Houston
 is
 ridiculous.
 Houston's


like
 freaking
 110
 degrees


in
 the
 summer.
 But
 LA,
 San
 Diego,
 you


know,
 that
 peaks
 out
 at
 like
 75,
 80,
 I


think.


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 just
 hate
 the
 cold
 now.


I
 hate
 the
 cold.


That's
 why
 I've
 been
 wearing
 my
 scarf


most
 more
 recently
 as
 well.


Uh,


Florida,
 no
 state
 income
 tax.
 That


definitely
 makes
 Florida
 more
 attractive


as
 well.


Look,
 I
 loved
 Miami
 when
 I
 went
 to


Miami.
 I
 absolutely
 loved
 it.


Miami
 was
 amazing.
 I
 I
 could
 really
 see


myself
 living
 in
 Miami.
 Not
 anytime
 soon


because
 again,
 I
 I
 just
 think
 for
 this


part
 of
 my
 life,
 I
 need
 to
 be
 close
 to


New
 York.
 Like
 New
 York
 is
 just
 where


the
 action
 is,
 but
 my
 goodness
 did
 I


love
 Miami.
 It's
 absolutely
 gorgeous.


And
 the
 weather
 was
 amazing.


Seasonality
 argument
 is
 pure
 cope.
 It's


definitely
 pure
 cope.
 It's
 absolutely


pure
 hope,
 but
 still.


All right.
 Is
 that
 it?
 Are
 we
 done?


We'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow
 morning.
 Market


open.
 We
 got
 the
 Robinet
 event
 this


week.
 Uh,
 I
 did
 interview
 a
 Hood


executive
 on
 Friday.
 That'll
 be
 out


after
 the
 Robinet
 event.
 I
 think
 you


guys
 will
 enjoy
 that
 one.
 That
 should
 be


fun.


Um,


I
 think
 that's
 it.
 Is
 Steve
 about
 to
 go


live?
 Can
 we
 spam
 Steve?


Steve
 going
 live?
 Is
 he
 doing


alternative
 assets
 weekly?


No,
 he's
 not.
 Okay,
 so
 we
 can't
 spam


Steam
 today.
 Dude,
 these
 thumbnails
 from


Steve,


look
 at
 this
 thumbnail,
 bro.


He's
 the
 reason
 why
 the
 power
 goats
 out


of
 my
 business
 in
 in
 in
 my
 business
 in


my
 building.
 Look
 at
 this
 thing.
 You
 got


Matt
 and
 Chris
 Sunday
 afternoon
 coffee


and
 stocks.
 That
 legit
 looks
 like
 Matt


and
 Chris


on
 a
 thumbnail.


How
 much
 energy
 was
 used
 from
 Gemini
 to


make
 that
 damn
 thing


and
 get
 it
 uploaded?


It's
 a
 great
 thumbnail,
 but


it's
 causing
 an
 issue
 for
 for
 energy


prices.


Yeah,
 three
 hours,
 dude.
 Matt,
 Chris,


and
 Steve.
 There
 you
 go.
 Nice
 little


coffee
 and
 stocks
 powered
 by
 Gemini


there.


He
 is
 loving
 Nano
 Banana
 100%.


For
 those
 that
 want
 to
 watch
 that,
 I'll


put
 the
 link
 in
 the
 chat.
 But
 he
 is


loving
 Nano
 Banano.


Also,
 I
 think
 I
 heard
 a
 little
 bit
 of


him
 either


on
 Friday
 or
 Saturday,
 maybe
 it
 was


today,
 but
 I
 think
 Steve's
 getting


interested
 in
 BG.


I
 think
 Matt
 and
 Chris
 got
 him
 on
 the
 VG


train.


So,


we
 might
 be
 getting
 Mr.
 Steve
 into


Venture
 Global
 Venture.
 It's
 up
 2%


overnight,
 627.


So,
 we'll
 see
 if
 we
 get
 him
 there
 as


well.


All right,
 that's
 it.
 Thank
 everybody.


Appreciate
 everyone
 being
 here.
 Um,


hopefully
 everyone
 had
 a
 good
 weekend.


I'll
 be
 back
 on
 the
 market
 open


tomorrow.
 Uh,
 and
 again,
 thank
 you
 all


for
 the
 love
 and
 support
 on
 the
 manager


stream.
 Uh,
 I
 read
 all
 the
 comments
 over


the
 past
 weekend
 and
 um,
 a
 lot
 of
 people


were
 just
 really
 excited
 for
 the


progress,
 the
 uh,
 excelling
 of
 whatever


this
 turns
 into
 next
 year
 and
 just
 have


a
 lot
 of
 different
 ideas
 and
 you
 know,


it's
 always
 cool
 to
 uh,
 bring
 more


people
 onto
 the
 team
 and
 kind
 of
 help


support
 the
 economy
 and
 be
 someone
 who


can
 actually
 help
 people
 make
 a
 living.


And
 so
 that's
 that's
 just
 really
 cool


from
 my
 perspective,
 but
 the
 only
 reason


I'm
 doing
 it
 is
 because,
 you
 know,
 you


need
 to
 actually
 move
 the
 business


forward.
 And
 so
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 what


we
 can
 do
 in
 2026.
 Should
 be
 very


exciting.


And
 we're
 going
 to
 keep
 it
 going
 from


there.
 Again,
 for
 the
 meetup
 link,
 I'll


put
 it
 right
 here
 in
 the
 chat.
 Um,
 I


have
 a
 new
 email
 as
 well.
 I'll
 put
 the


new
 email
 in
 the
 chat.
 It's


emitcoms.com.


And
 then
 for
 Jess,
 it's
 Jesscoms.com.


Realistically,
 I'd
 rather
 you
 message


her
 than
 me
 because
 it
 just
 it'll
 be


easier
 for
 her
 to
 see
 the
 email
 and


screen
 it.
 So,
 for
 anyone
 who's
 been


trying
 to
 get
 in
 contact
 for
 anything,


whether
 it's
 podcast,
 any
 random


inquiries
 people
 have,
 this
 will
 be
 the


email
 that
 like
 can
 really
 get
 the


response
 and
 and
 get
 things
 going
 in
 the


the
 right
 direction.


Also,
 lot
 of
 Substack
 articles
 coming


out
 this
 week.
 I
 owe
 you
 guys
 a
 lot
 of


articles.
 Last
 week,
 getting
 sick
 kind


of
 ruined
 it,
 but
 been
 working
 hard
 hard


about
 four
 articles
 that
 should
 be
 out


this
 week.
 So,
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 substack


content
 coming
 this
 weekend.
 Um,
 that


should
 be
 out
 closer
 towards
 the
 end
 of


the
 week
 for
 people
 to
 people
 to
 check


it
 out.


All right.
 Thank
 everybody.
 Have
 a
 good


one.
 I
 will
 see
 you
 guys
 on
 the
 market


open
 and
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


Thank
 everybody.
 Good
 night.
 Have
 a
 good


one.
 See
 you
 guys
 tomorrow
 on
 the
 market


open.
 Bye
 everybody.
