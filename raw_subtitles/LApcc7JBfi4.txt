Today I’m going to get into the movie analysis of “Poor Things”
"Poor Things" wins 4 major Oscars this year
It’s also one of my favorite works of the year
The story tells the story of London, England during the Victorian era in the 19th century
Bella, a pregnant woman, attempted suicide
Artificially resurrected by scientist Godwin
Remove the mother's brain
transplanted into the baby's brain
Bella therefore has the body of an adult and the mind of a baby
Become Godwin's experimental subject to observe closely
This kind of brain-taking experiment actually originated from the mechanical materialism popular in the Enlightenment era.
before 18th century
People believe in Descartes’ mind-matter dualism
Believe that there is a soul in the brain that controls the body
The soul is given by God and has free will
But the philosopher La Mettrie discovered
After many experiments in which people's brains were removed,
The organs in the body will still function on their own
This means that the body has its own movement principles
have one's own will
The human body is actually an automatic machine that determines the person's actions
So anatomy is a person's destiny
The so-called soul and free will are just the imagination of the brain.
"Poor Thing" takes La Mettrie's mechanistic philosophy to its extreme
Godwin assembled the heads and bodies of animals at will
It's like playing with Legos
Bella's body was reassembled like a machine
In the end, Bella inherited Godwin's scientific career.
Put a sheep's head into your ex-husband's brain
La Mettrie's mechanistic dream comes true
Man is a machine
The human brain can also be equipped with an animal body
In fact, in Lanthimo's past movies
We have already seen the transformation between human nature and animal nature
In "Extraordinary Religious Desire"
The father lied to the child that the mother would give birth to a dog
Implying that those children are like domesticated dogs
With canine teeth that will never mature
In "Solo Zoo"
Those who cannot find a mate will be punished by being turned into animals
Single people are like animals exiled from society
In "The Killing of a Sacred Deer"
After the hero's family is cursed
Human free will is bound
Loss of human-like mobility
In these examples
Human actions lack the warmth of humanity
are limited by their animal bodies
Unlike Christianity, God gives people free will
Make people make moral judgments
People in Lanthimo's movies are deprived of their free will
lack of moral subjectivity
But what's different about "Poor Thing" is that
Challenging this mechanistic philosophy
Don’t reduce human nature to just animality
The entire movie is in response to this question from scientist Godwin.
at the beginning of the movie
Bella is indeed no different from an animal
No sense of autonomy, rationality, morality
Just pure infantile impulse
The one who truly possesses subjectivity is Godwin, who is like his father.
You can experiment on Bella
Satisfy your thirst for knowledge
But in order to control the experimental results without interference
Bella has always been limited by the artificial environment created by her father
In "Extraordinary Religious Desire"
We also see this overly omnipotent father figure
Children are not allowed to know the unknown outside
Speak the language their father gave them instead of the common language
<font color=#FFF700FF>Mom</font>
<font color=#FFF700FF>Two little zombies were found</font>
<font color=#FFF700FF>Do you want to pick it for you? </font>
He has been staying at home and being supported by his father.
As a result, he became a giant baby with no sense of autonomy and who will not grow up.
Both examples reflect what the philosopher Badiou calls the “pathogenic structure of the family.”
The family is the most difficult structure to shake in the changes of human society.
Even in the public domain
We have entered a modern, democratic, civil society
But in the private family
But still stuck in feudalism
Full of patriarchy, domestic violence, and controlling parents
Modern society thus conceals a pathological division
People outside shouting for freedom and democracy
after returning home
but recreates an undemocratic power structure
The ending of "Extraordinary Teaching Desire"
Children finally have the opportunity to explore the outside world
And that's exactly where "Poor Things" begins
by accident
Bella sees the external reality
Not a greenhouse created by my father
This new experience made her eager to understand the unknown
The desire to rebel against the Creator also began to appear
After Bella discovers physical pleasure
The will to resist becomes even stronger
Bella's behavior was immediately criticized by Max
Looking at it now, we may think it’s nothing.
But in the 19th century the Victorian era
Masturbation is a moral evil
Like one of Freud's famous cases, Little Hans
I started to like playing with my penis when I was three years old
But my mother threatened me that if I played with it again, I would cut it off.
Later, little Hans developed a mental illness called panic disorder.
same
Godwin in the movie was castrated by his father since he was a child.
Became a eunuch
To be immune to sexual temptation
Dedicated to scientific research
This case of sexual repression
In the Victorian period there were too many
It’s also because of the repression within the family.
Let Bella choose to leave the free prison of family
When Bella arrives in Lisbon
Movies change from black and white to color
It's like leaving a repressive family that only sees black and white
Start experiencing food, sex, and music for the first time
Satisfy your desire to explore the real world
But Poor Thing reveals
Even if a person cannot escape the shackles of his family
Still cannot escape the powerful restrictive structure of society
in high-society social situations
Bella is taught by Duncan to abide by the rules and can only say certain lines.
But when Bella does what Duncan says
But because it was not the right time to speak,
and make social media inoperable
it's here
We're seeing what sociologist Harold Garfinkel calls "destructive experiments."
Why social interaction works smoothly
It’s because everyone subconsciously follows the moral code script
What words should not be said while eating
You should pretend you didn’t see what happened at the next table.
These norms have long been internalized in our bones
People are corrected when their behavior deviates from the script
to stabilize realistic operations
This reflects that social order is actually the result of people's continuous efforts to maintain it.
In comparison
Bella's mental age is that of a child
no shame
No moral framework is taboo
Instead, you can enjoy unrestricted freedom
Bella is like Eve in the Garden of Eden
Before you eat the fruit of good and evil, you don’t know what morality is
It wasn’t until he was taught many times by Duncan that he began to feel ashamed.
it's here
Godwin's question gets an answer
The difference between humans and animals is shame
Darwin thought
Shame is a uniquely human emotion
Because only humans can blush, not other animals
Blushing is because people are thinking about how others are thinking about themselves
So when Bella starts to feel ashamed
This means that she is gradually growing up
There is an extra human dimension
On the one hand, she naturally longs for freedom
On the other hand, she has learned the unique human sense of shame
Both of these are characteristics that distinguish humans from animals.
But these two kinds of human nature are contradictory
Because of shame, Bella can no longer be as childlike as before.
and must limit one's freedom
On the way to Athens
Bella's humanity has been expanded to the third level
Not just a desire for freedom and a sense of shame
Still eager for self-improvement
The debate between Ms. Martha and Mr. Harry
In fact, it was the subject of heated debate among philosophers in the 19th century
Is it possible for society and human nature to progress and improve?
If La Mettrie's mechanical materialism is right
Then human nature is just like animals
They are all driven by body desires and impulses
This means that Bella is destined to repeat her mother's behavior
Because she is an existence determined by her mother’s body
However, another school of German romanticism represented by Goethe believed that
People can transform society through philosophical knowledge
and thus improve human nature
Progress is when people go from ignorance to knowledge
Cultivate your own spirit through new knowledge
Bella's process of growing up is like this self-improvement
That's why Ms. Martha suggested Bella read Goethe
Because it was Goethe who started the tradition of Bildungsroman
This optimism makes Europeans believe that they will lead the progress of all mankind
Therefore, the 19th century is also called the age of improvement by historians.
But the desire to know for the sake of progress
Instead, Bella unexpectedly saw the true face of the world.
Sailing around Alexandria
Alexandria is on this journey
The only non-European city
Egypt at the end of the 19th century was a colony occupied by Britain
It's here
Bella discovers for the first time
The world is not just about beautiful things
There are still many suffering people in the world
in this play
Poor things become those third world workers
Capitalism brought wealth to Europe
But it also covers up the extreme poverty of a large number of working people behind the scenes.
Even if Bella wanted to help the poor, there was nothing she could do
There is no ladder connecting the world of rich and poor
Only then did Bella realize the wonderful life she had experienced before.
It turned out to be a privilege that only belonged to a small group of Europeans.
Bella didn't have enough knowledge at this time to know
It turns out that the progress of European countries and the freedom of the Victorians
It is based on plundering the resources of colonized countries.
Instead blame the problem on the rarity of money
As a result, Bella's behavior of robbing the rich and giving to the poor made both her and Duncan pitiable.
Forced to disembark in Paris
But it also allows Bella to change her perspective
live like a poor man
It’s no longer about experiencing the beautiful things in the world
But to understand the ugly side of the world
In a Paris brothel
Bella finally realizes the ugly side of the world
Power dynamics in sexual relationships
at the beginning of the journey
Duncan tells Bella: No need to commit to a one-on-one relationship
But when Bella has sex with other men
When you want to compare the sexual performance differences between other men and Duncan
But it was regarded as "devalued" by Duncan.
Only then did Bella realize
Men with rich sexual experience will be regarded as love experts
But women are rich in sexual experience, but they will be humiliated as sluts
Bella, who naturally pursues sexual freedom
But I discovered the lack of freedom in sexual relationships
This contradiction becomes even more apparent when Bella works in a brothel
What some men long for is women’s lack of freedom
woman's resistance
This makes Bella once again face the two contradictions between human nature
People long for sex and also long for freedom
But sexual relations actually contain lack of freedom
Bella's way of resolving conflicts
is to get rid of economic dependence on men
Realize that you must use your own labor to make money
Also made Bella a socialist
So far
Four cities on the journey
It just reflects Bella's exploration of freedom.
Four contradictions faced
Under the control of his father in London
Experiencing the conflict between family and freedom
Being socially constrained in Lisbon
Experiencing the contradiction between shame and freedom
Constrained by lack of knowledge in Athens
Experiencing the paradox of self-improvement and freedom
Constrained by power relations in Paris
Experiencing the contradiction between sex and freedom
every journey
Bella has new conflicts to overcome
This also gives me a deeper understanding of freedom.
Finally made a full circle back to London
Just discovered a shocking truth
It turns out that Bella is the product of a brain transplant.
She is her own mother and her own child
This immediately raises a question
Bella's past actions in pursuit of freedom
Really out of her own free will
Or is it determined by the mother’s body?
If she's just repeating her mother's behavior
That's not true freedom
Bella canceled the wedding because of this
Follow her ex-husband to discover her mother's past
Find out the truth about this body
It turns out that my mother is not a kind person
But a person who takes pleasure in the pain of others
This is exactly the opposite of the humanity shown by Bella
Bella's growth process is also opposite to that of her mother.
A mother who committed suicide would have been considered crazy at the time.
and was sent to a mental hospital
But in Bella's sexual relationship
It was Duncan who went crazy because he couldn't get Bella's love.
Finally he was sent to a mental hospital
La Mettrie's theory that "man is a machine" has been overturned
Anatomy is not destiny
But when Bella was leaving her ex-husband
But faced the last obstacle to freedom
victorian sexual science believed
Women are disobedient and emotionally uncontrolled
Or when you are not interested in men
may be a symptom of hysteria
To tame women
There were all kinds of weird treatments
Vibrating rocking chair
uterine massage
removal of clitoris
Anyway, the problem lies with women
Rather than patriarchy driving women crazy
Until French physician Jean-Martin Charcot invented hypnotherapy
Hysteria turns from a physical problem into a psychological problem
in the original novel
When Bella arrived in Paris, she asked Charcot to conduct hypnosis experiments.
But she was pretending to be hypnotized and cooperated with the performance
Let Charcot think his treatment was successful
Here we see the resistance of female subjectivity
This resistance is precisely the origin of psychoanalysis
Freud originally followed Charcot in using hypnosis to treat hysteria.
But when touching the female patient’s forehead,
But was rejected and said: don’t touch me
This led Freud to turn to talk therapy
Let patients talk about their past
When the suppressed history is revealed
The symptoms of hysteria disappeared
And in the movie
Bella is the woman accused by her ex-husband of being hysterical
But the truth of the past is hidden in mother's body
Not in Bella's head
So go discover your mother's history
In fact, it’s about discovering the suppressed truth about your own body.
Thus
Bella is more than just a doctor
A psychoanalyst
Convert the history experienced by the body into conscious history
In the ending, I got the truth about myself:
Bella did not repeat her mother's path
Even with a crazy body
But still have a free mind
etc.
So what exactly is freedom?
during the enlightenment
For the first time, mankind shouted that people have the freedom to boldly seek knowledge
No need to fear any political or religious authority
Many scientists appeared to conduct various experiments to test the truth
But when the experimental creature becomes human beings themselves
Scientists pursuing freedom
Instead, he created the power to resist himself
The relationship between Godwin and Bella is like that between God and his creation.
Every man that Mr. Bei met in his life
They also long to be his creator
In the name of father's love, suppress her desires
In the name of her fiancé, bind her as his wife
Accusing her lover of being a slut in the name of her love
In the name of her ex-husband, she was imprisoned at home
But each time Bella refused to be a creature
Take the initiative to leave home for adventure and leave God Godwin
reject fiancé’s request
Abandoned Duncan, drove him crazy and sent him to a mental hospital
Finally, I had surgery to turn my ex-husband into a sheep.
All the men who stand in her way become pitiful things
Bella shows what makes humans different from the rest of creation
People will question and rebel against the Creator
Philosopher Sartre believes
Everything was created to have a purpose
Scissors were created to cut things
Bella was created to satisfy Godwin's thirst for knowledge
The nature of creation is defined by its Creator
But after humans are created by their parents,
But you will ask yourself why you exist
Other animals don't ask this question
But just follow the Creator’s arrangements
For example, dogs can be set as family dogs, drug detection dogs, and guide dogs.
But you won't see your dog suddenly want to be a drug dog
This is the difference between Bella and the second experiment Felicity
Felicity is just a creature, without her own subjectivity
But Bella will question the purpose of her creation
This represents a kind of transcendence in human nature
can transcend his creaturely state
to plan your future
Achieve a more complete state of humanity
When one transcends the limitations imposed on oneself
It also surpasses oneself
This forgotten transcendence in human nature
It is called freedom by Saudi Arabia
Everyone is born incomplete
Like an unfinished work of art that needs improvement
But only when man realizes that he is free
He just became the author of the artwork
You can shape yourself into what you want
Instead of being shaped by family and environment,
Just like Bella's clothes from being restrained
Turn it into an outfit with your own personal style
But people often forget that they are actually free
Forgot that you can intervene in the workings of the world
When Harry chooses to be indifferent to the suffering of the world
He defined himself as a desperate person
Denies the possibility of free human action
And the moment when Bella cried for the poor
I made a moral choice with my own tears.
Decide to regard the suffering of the world as your own suffering
Freedom therefore also means responsibility
Because every time I move freely
They are all setting an example to the world.
Show what possibilities people can live out of themselves
When France was occupied by Nazi troops
Saudi Arabia shouted
This is the freest moment for us French people
Why can we still call freedom when we are occupied?
Because he became a Nazi prisoner of war
The French still have a chance to prove
Prisoners of war are not determined beings
and be able to resist and regain freedom
When the French chose to resist the Nazis
Is making a choice on behalf of all mankind
Decide which life value people should recognize
Likewise, when Bella rejected marriage twice in a row
Just prove it with actions
Women can have a life that is not bound by marriage
Refuse to let society define what it means to be a woman
The poor thing thus becomes an existential statement
Each of us can be Bella
Within everyone's inner life lies the possibility of freedom
family control
society's expectations
money and power
Sexual relations and morality
These shackles that still restrict human life today
Let humans live like pathetic things
But Bella showed us
It is possible to be a free being
Each of us is born into this world
But they all have the potential to become their own creators
Regaining the long-forgotten freedom within us
