Hello,
 my
 friends.
 Today
 is
 February


21st,
 and
 this
 is
 Markets
 Weekly.
 So,


this
 past
 week,
 the
 major
 indexes


basically
 went
 nowhere.
 We
 did
 have
 the


S&P
 500
 regained
 the
 50-day
 moving


average,
 but
 when
 you
 zoom
 out
 a
 bit,
 it


really
 looks
 to
 me
 that
 the
 indexes
 have


gone
 nowhere
 for
 months,
 are
 losing


momentum,
 and
 that
 is
 not
 good.


So
 the
 biggest
 news
 the
 past
 week
 of
 was


of
 course
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 bombshell
 on


Friday
 ruling
 that
 the
 president
 cannot


impose
 tariffs
 under
 emergency
 powers.


So
 today
 let's
 first
 talk
 about
 what


happened
 there
 and
 what
 could
 be
 the


next
 steps
 and
 secondly
 let's
 talk
 about


some
 miscellaneous
 topics
 like
 data
 fed


minutes
 ECB.
 All right
 starting
 with
 the


tariffs.
 So,
 just
 for
 some
 context,


remember
 last
 April
 Liberation
 Day?
 The


president
 stood
 in
 the
 rose
 garden
 with


this
 giant
 poster
 board
 with
 all
 sorts


of
 random
 numbers
 on
 it
 and
 declared


that
 he
 was
 going
 to
 impose
 tariffs


bigly
 on
 many
 countries
 throughout
 the


world
 unless
 they
 came
 and
 made
 a
 deal


that
 panicked
 the
 markets.
 But
 in
 the


months
 that
 followed,
 many
 countries
 did


come
 and
 sign
 memorandums
 of


understanding
 with
 the
 US.
 In
 some


cases,
 uh
 they
 did
 result
 in
 concrete


investment.
 There's
 reporting
 that
 Japan


uh
 a
 very
 very
 good
 US
 ally
 is
 making


investments
 according
 to
 their
 trade


deal.
 However,
 many
 people
 were


wondering
 does
 the
 president
 actually


have
 authority
 to
 do
 that?
 That
 seems


kind
 of
 uh
 excessive.
 I
 mean
 does
 is


there
 really
 a
 fentinel
 crisis
 with


Canada
 such
 that
 the
 president
 can


declare
 an
 emergency
 and
 impose
 tariffs?


Well,
 we
 were
 all
 about
 to
 find
 out.
 On


Friday,
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 ruled
 that


actually
 no
 doesn't
 give
 the
 president


power
 to
 impose
 tariffs.
 The
 president


can
 do
 things
 like
 embargos,
 but
 a


tariff
 is
 a
 taxation


power
 resizing
 Congress.
 So
 the


president
 can't
 do
 that.
 And
 the
 Supreme


Court
 is
 completely
 correct.
 Congress


has
 the
 power
 of
 the
 tax.
 But
 over
 the


past
 few
 decades,
 Congress
 has
 through


legislation
 delegated
 a
 lot
 of
 tariff


power
 to
 the
 president.
 So
 whereas
 the


president
 cannot
 we
 find
 out
 impose


tariffs
 under
 AIPA.
 The
 president
 had
 a


news
 conference
 right
 after
 the
 uh


Friday
 ruling
 and
 declared
 that
 he
 would


impose
 global
 tariffs
 of
 10%
 through


section
 122
 pars
 which
 is
 on
 much


sounder
 legal
 grounds.
 On
 Saturday


morning
 uh
 through
 uh
 truth
 social
 tweet


he
 declared
 that
 he's
 actually
 going
 to


raise
 them
 to
 15%
 globally.
 Now
 under


section
 122
 the
 president
 can
 have
 15%


tariffs
 globally


but
 for
 a
 maximum
 of
 150
 days.
 However


there
 that
 is
 not
 the
 only
 avenue
 where


the
 president
 can
 impose
 tariffs.
 He
 can


also
 impose
 tariffs
 through
 other
 more


traditional
 means
 such
 as
 section
 301.


During
 his
 first
 term
 the
 president


imposed
 section
 301
 tariffs
 on
 on
 China


that
 continued
 under
 the
 Biden


administration
 and
 continued
 to
 this


day.
 The
 difference
 is
 that
 in
 order
 to


impose
 tariffs
 under
 section
 301,
 you


have
 to
 have
 an
 investigation,
 a


hearing,
 and
 then
 you
 can
 impose


tariffs.
 However,
 tariffs
 under
 that


section
 are
 under


are
 on
 much
 sturdier
 legal
 ground.
 So


the
 game
 plan
 seems
 to
 be
 that
 sure


we're
 losing
 AIPA
 tariffs
 but
 we
 will


replace
 them
 with
 section
 122
 tariffs


for
 150
 days
 and
 in
 the
 meantime
 we'll


conduct
 all
 the
 necessary
 investigations


so
 that
 we
 can
 have
 other
 section
 301


tariffs
 ready
 to
 go.


So
 according
 to
 analysis
 from
 Bloomberg


it
 seems
 like
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


overall
 the
 tariffs
 rates
 will
 basically


be
 unchanged.
 the
 president
 would
 simply


shift
 uh
 his
 legal
 authority
 from
 aipa


to
 other
 legal
 authority
 that's
 um
 less


likely
 to
 be
 overturned
 by
 the
 court.
 So


it
 looks
 like
 we
 are
 going
 to
 have
 this


tariff
 wall.
 It's
 going
 to
 continue.


This
 has
 been
 a
 hiccup,
 but
 the


president
 is
 ultimately
 going
 to
 get


what
 he
 wants.
 Now
 I
 would
 also
 remind


everyone
 that
 President
 Biden
 also


continued
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 uh
 tariffs
 that


Trump
 put
 on.
 So
 these
 tariffs
 will


probably
 going
 to
 continue
 under
 a


democratic
 administration
 as
 well.
 This


really
 does
 look
 to
 be
 uh
 the
 new
 trade


policy
 for
 the
 United
 States
 of
 America.


However,
 what
 about
 all
 those
 tariff


revenue
 collected
 the
 past
 year?
 There


were
 a
 few
 hundred
 billion
 under
 AIPA.


Now
 surely
 those
 are
 illegal
 and
 they


have
 to
 be
 refunded,
 right?
 Because
 the


president
 could
 not
 impose
 tariffs
 under


AIPA.
 Well,
 actually
 the
 Supreme
 Court


did
 not
 rule
 on
 that.
 So,
 uh,
 that's


going
 to
 be
 a
 decision,
 uh,
 that's
 going


to
 be
 litigated
 in
 the
 lower
 courts.
 So,


this
 kind
 of
 sets
 up
 this
 huge
 messy


showdown
 because,
 well,
 who
 is
 going
 to


get
 the
 refund?
 Now,
 some
 new
 data,
 new


study
 from
 the
 New
 York
 Fed
 shows
 that


uh,
 actually
 tariffs
 were
 mostly
 paid
 by


US
 importers
 and
 US
 consumers.
 This
 is


also
 what
 happened
 in
 2017,
 2018
 when


Trump
 did
 tariffs
 the
 first
 time
 around.


Uh
 the
 exporters
 did
 pay
 some
 tariffs


but
 not
 a
 whole
 lot.
 The
 tariffs
 did


seem
 to
 successfully
 have
 an
 impact
 on


rewiring
 global
 trade.
 Looking
 at
 New


York
 Fed
 study,
 uh
 there
 is
 much
 less


imports
 coming
 from
 China.
 But
 keep
 in


mind
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 was
 simply


rerouting
 where
 for
 example
 Chinese


companies
 setting
 up
 shop
 in
 Mexico,
 in


Thailand
 and
 Vietnam
 and
 basically


producing
 and
 exporting
 from
 those


countries
 some
 kind
 of
 tariff
 arbitrage.


However,
 um
 you
 know,
 this
 the
 subs


probably
 did
 seem
 to
 have
 some
 did
 have


some
 impact
 likely.
 Now,
 the
 problem


with
 giving
 tariff
 refunds
 is
 that
 when


an
 item
 comes
 across
 the
 border,
 the


importer
 is
 the
 one
 that
 concretely
 pays


the
 tariff.
 However,
 in
 some
 cases,
 the


importer
 turns
 around
 and
 raises
 the


prices
 to
 the
 consumer
 or
 whoever
 he


resells
 it
 to
 to
 try
 to
 pass
 along
 some


of
 the
 cost.


how
 much
 that
 is,
 you
 know,
 no,
 that's


going
 to
 be
 um,
 you
 know,
 honestly
 a


kind
 of
 a
 subjective
 thing,
 right?
 So,
 I


think
 it's
 unlikely
 for
 an
 importer
 to


actually
 have
 a
 paper
 trail
 and
 tell
 the


consumer
 or
 whoever
 that,
 you
 know,


we're
 raising
 your
 prices
 because
 of


this
 uh
 by
 this
 much
 because
 of
 the


tariffs.
 So,
 if
 we
 were
 to
 get
 a
 big


tariff
 refund
 to
 whoever
 paid
 the
 the


tariff
 invoice,
 which
 would
 be
 the


easiest
 way
 of
 doing
 this,
 uh
 the


importer
 would
 get
 a
 huge
 windfall
 of


hundreds
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars,
 right?


Because
 they
 would
 be
 able
 to
 keep
 the


extra
 revenue
 they
 received
 from
 raising


prices
 to
 consumers
 and
 they
 would
 also


get
 their
 tariff
 payments
 back.
 So,


that's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 mess.
 So,
 we're


not
 really
 sure
 how
 that's
 going
 to
 be


untangled.
 So,
 uh
 the
 most
 likely


outcome
 is
 that
 we
 are
 stuck
 in


litigation
 for
 uh
 a
 few
 years
 and
 none


of
 that
 tariff
 revenue
 um
 gets
 refunded


uh
 at least
 for
 for
 some
 time.
 So,
 the


impact
 on
 the
 markets
 on
 Friday
 was
 was


unamiguously
 positive,
 right?
 Tariffs


are
 a
 tax
 and
 now
 that
 we
 have
 the
 tax


removed,
 at least
 um
 perceived
 removed


for
 that
 one
 day,
 but
 again,
 tariffs
 are


coming
 right
 back.
 So,
 it
 doesn't
 seem


like
 that's
 something
 to
 be
 concerned


of.
 Now,
 some
 people
 were
 were
 thinking


that
 if
 we
 had
 the
 Supreme
 Court


overturn
 tariffs,
 the
 bond
 market
 will


revolt
 because
 that
 means
 the
 deficit


would
 go
 much
 higher.
 Uh
 we
 did
 seem
 to


have
 yields
 go
 up
 a
 little
 bit,
 but


really
 that
 that
 could
 just
 be
 a
 risk
 on


episode.
 And
 to
 be
 clear,
 rates
 are


largely
 the
 expected
 path
 of
 Fed
 policy


and
 we
 don't
 actually
 know
 how
 the


Treasury
 was
 going
 to
 issue
 uh
 debt


going
 forward.
 suppose
 that
 the
 deficit


really
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 few
 hundred


billion
 higher
 due
 to
 the
 lack
 of


tariffs.
 You
 know,
 maybe
 they
 just
 issue


more
 in
 the
 short
 end
 and
 the
 short
 end


it
 largely
 follows
 very
 very
 strongly


follows
 expected
 path
 of
 Fed
 policy.
 So,


so
 you
 really
 wouldn't
 expect
 to
 see


much
 of
 a
 change
 in
 yields
 there.
 So,


all
 in
 all,
 tariffs
 are
 here
 to
 stay


guys
 just
 have
 to
 get
 used
 to
 it.
 All


right.
 Secondly,
 let's
 talk
 about
 all


sorts
 of
 miscellaneous
 things
 that


happened
 last
 week.
 So,
 we
 did
 have
 GDP


data
 and
 we
 did
 have
 some
 inflation


data.
 GDP
 was
 notably
 weaker
 than


expected,
 surprisingly
 weaker
 than


expected,
 largely
 due
 to
 the
 government


shutdown.
 Remember
 last
 quarter
 the


government
 was
 shut
 down
 for
 several


weeks
 and
 we
 had
 a
 whole
 lot
 of
 people


not
 working.
 Now,
 inflation
 was
 also


surprising
 to
 the
 upside.
 But
 zooming


out
 really
 GDP
 inflation
 h
 has
 been


where
 it's
 been
 for
 the
 past
 several


quarters.
 So
 inflation
 a
 little
 bit


below
 3%
 and
 GDP
 you
 know
 stronger
 than


some
 expected
 on
 third
 quarter
 but
 again


weaker
 than
 expected
 fourth
 quarter
 you


average
 that
 out
 still
 seems
 to
 be
 like


we're
 around
 2%
 and
 change.
 So
 uh
 it


seems
 to
 me
 that
 really
 we're
 just
 kind


of
 pretty
 stable
 here.
 Um
 and
 so
 what


does
 that
 mean
 for
 monetary
 policy?


Well,
 surprisingly
 in
 the
 Fed
 minutes,


there
 was
 some
 commentary
 from
 some,


let's
 just
 say,
 Fed
 presidents
 uh
 that


maybe
 we
 should
 talk
 about
 that
 uh
 rates


are
 two-sided,
 that
 we
 can
 not
 just
 cut


rates,
 but
 we
 could
 also
 raise
 rates
 as


well,
 seemingly
 thinking
 that,
 you
 know,


inflation
 is
 still
 stubborn,
 maybe
 that


we
 are
 not
 being
 restrictive
 enough,


maybe
 we
 should
 hike
 rates
 later
 on
 in


the
 year,
 or
 at least
 have
 the


possibility
 of
 doing
 so.
 Now,
 for


context,
 the
 market
 is
 pricing
 in
 two


cuts
 this
 year.


And
 uh
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 kind
 of


ridiculous
 for
 for
 anyone
 on
 the
 FOMC
 to


be
 suggesting
 that
 they
 would
 hike


rates.
 I
 mean,
 the
 trend
 for
 the


unemployment
 rate
 is
 clearly
 upwards.


The
 trend
 for
 inflation
 is
 clearly


downwards,
 although
 of
 course
 it
 has


been
 plateauing.
 So
 uh
 it's a
 high
 rates


in
 in
 that
 context
 given
 that
 uh
 the


broader
 public
 is
 feeling
 down
 on


consumer
 sentiment
 given
 that
 the


administration
 is
 insisting
 on
 lower


rates
 and
 and
 given
 that
 um
 you
 know


back
 in
 2021
 when
 inflation
 was
 5%
 many


people
 were
 saying
 that
 hey
 it's


transitory
 we
 shouldn't
 do
 anything
 and


that's
 just
 too
 ridiculous
 and
 shows
 me


that
 yeah
 these
 what
 what
 I
 actually


already
 know
 that
 many
 of
 these
 guys


have
 no
 idea
 what
 they're
 doing.
 So,
 I


don't
 pay
 any
 attention
 to
 that.


Honestly,
 the
 path
 of
 monetary
 policy
 is


going
 to
 be
 more
 dictated
 uh
 by
 events


that
 are
 happening
 in
 the
 background


that
 are
 far
 more
 important
 than
 uh


whatever
 happens
 with
 uh
 inflation
 in
 in


the
 coming
 months
 uh
 which
 we'll
 talk


about
 a
 little
 bit.
 And
 the
 last
 thing,


miscellaneous
 thing
 that
 I
 I'll
 I'll


mention
 is
 that
 there's
 an
 interesting


article
 in
 the
 Financial
 Times
 saying


that
 uh
 Madame
 Lagard,
 president
 of
 the


ECB,
 is
 going
 to
 enter
 term
 earlier
 than


before
 it
 expires
 uh
 because
 she
 would


like
 to
 have
 uh
 President
 Mcron
 play
 a


role
 in
 appointing
 her
 successor.
 For


contest,
 uh
 the
 president
 of
 the
 bank
 to


France
 also
 resigned
 earlier
 than


expected
 so
 that
 Macron
 can
 name
 his


successor.
 So
 the
 fear
 is
 according
 to


the
 article
 that
 um
 you
 could
 have


someone
 from
 the
 right
 populist
 party
 uh


win
 and
 then
 appoint
 someone
 of
 their


choosing
 to
 be
 uh
 president
 of
 the
 monk


trance
 or
 uh
 have
 a
 say
 in
 who
 becomes


president
 of
 the
 ECB.
 So
 it's
 it's


playing
 a
 political
 game
 that
 we
 see


sometimes
 in
 the
 US
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the


Supreme
 Court.
 Uh
 as
 we
 know
 oftentimes


um


uh
 a
 liberal
 justice
 would
 like
 to


resign
 during
 a
 democratic
 president
 so


that
 the
 replacement
 named
 could
 also
 be


a
 liberal
 justice
 and
 a
 conservative


justice
 would
 also
 like
 to
 resign
 during


the
 time
 when
 a
 when
 a
 republican


president
 is
 in
 charge
 so
 that
 a


Republican
 president
 can
 name
 a
 uh


Republican
 successor.
 So
 there
 are
 many


people
 for
 example
 uh
 suggesting
 that


maybe
 Justice
 Thomas
 who
 is
 a
 very


conservative
 justice
 should
 resign
 at


the
 moment
 so
 that
 Trump
 can
 replace
 him


otherwise
 he
 could
 you
 know
 suddenly


pass
 away
 on
 of
 natural
 causes
 during
 a


democratic
 administration
 and
 get


replaced
 by
 um
 a
 democratic
 justice
 and


and
 tip
 the
 balance
 of
 power.
 So
 that's


a
 game
 that
 we
 play
 in
 the
 US
 for
 the


Supreme
 Court
 and
 now
 it
 seems
 that


they're
 playing
 the
 same
 game
 in
 the


European
 Union.
 So
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 an


interesting
 development
 and
 it
 does
 show


that
 they
 are
 very
 worried
 about
 uh


perhaps
 if
 you
 could
 have
 a
 different


political
 makeup
 in
 the
 EU
 that
 would


leak
 into
 monetary
 policy.
 In
 the
 case


of
 France
 uh
 actually
 the
 inflation
 is


very
 much
 below
 target.
 The
 economy
 is


not
 doing
 well
 and
 we
 all
 know
 they
 have


a
 fiscal
 situation
 that
 would
 uh
 really


appreciate
 lower
 rates.
 So
 that
 that's


an
 interesting
 political
 dynamic
 to


think
 about
 when
 thinking
 about
 the
 ECB


going
 forward.


Um
 so
 one
 thing
 to
 keep
 in
 mind
 and
 the


last
 thing
 we'll
 talk
 about
 is
 that
 it


does
 seem
 that
 war
 with
 Iran
 is
 very


likely
 um
 maybe
 this
 weekend
 maybe
 in


the
 coming
 days.
 Now
 um
 recall
 uh
 there


was
 an
 Israeli
 attack
 against
 Iran
 last


year
 that
 the
 US
 participated
 in
 in
 a


defensive
 way
 and
 the
 US
 also
 through


operation
 midnight
 basically
 flew
 a


bunch
 of
 bombers
 to
 Iran
 and
 bombed
 uh


their
 nuclear
 facility.
 So
 uh
 there
 has


been
 ongoing
 conflict
 in
 the
 Middle
 East


involving
 the
 US
 for
 for
 a
 year
 now.
 And


now
 with
 all
 the
 US
 air
 force
 assets


being
 moved
 there
 and
 there
 is
 a
 huge


amount
 of
 assets
 we
 have
 uh
 another


carrier
 who
 that
 will
 be
 in
 position
 uh


this
 Sunday.
 So
 they
 are
 in


uh
 in
 a
 position
 to
 have
 a
 major


operation
 against
 Iran.
 Um
 again
 they


say
 that
 negotiations
 on
 ongoing
 but


negotiations
 were
 also
 ongoing
 during


the
 first
 operation
 as
 well.
 So
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 tinder
 there
 and
 all
 it
 needs


is
 a
 spark
 and
 sometimes
 when
 you
 have


powerful
 political
 interests
 those


sparks
 can
 be
 created.
 So
 that
 is


something
 that
 could
 if
 it
 happens


really
 dominate
 and
 o
 overshadow


anything
 that
 happens
 in
 u
 trade
 policy


or
 GDP
 or
 whatnot.
 uh
 there's
 a


potential
 for
 this
 to
 become
 very
 messy.


The
 president
 has
 had
 tremendous
 success


in
 um
 extracting
 Maduro
 um
 in
 bombing


Iran
 last
 year,
 but
 again
 there's
 many


many
 unknowns
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 an


operation
 of
 this
 scale.
 So
 that's


something
 I
 think
 uh
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the


biggest
 event
 to
 watch
 in
 the
 coming


weeks.
 It
 would
 be
 tremendously
 riskoff.


Um
 so
 that's
 uh
 what
 I
 would
 focus
 on


for
 the
 coming
 days.
 All
 right.
 So


that's
 how
 I
 prepare
 for
 today.
 Thanks


so
 much
 for
 tuning
 in.
 I'll
 talk
 to
 you


guys
 next
 week.
