This
 episode
 we'll
 be
 talking
 about


adult
 topics
 with
 sexual
 language.
 If


you've
 got
 kids
 around,
 probably
 best
 to


save
 the
 episode
 for
 another
 time.


The
 thing
 I
 always
 tell
 people
 is
 even


if
 you
 hate
 it
 as
 a
 sex
 toy,
 it's
 a


really
 good
 back
 massager.
 So,
 you're


not
 wasting
 your
 money.


>> That's
 really
 funny.


>> Yeah.
 Like
 there
 are
 other
 things
 you


can
 use
 it
 for.


>> I'm
 Christine
 Zerette.
 I'm
 Kyra


Blackwell.


>> I'm
 Rosie
 Garren.
 And
 you're
 listening


to
 the
 Wire
 Cutter
 Show.


Hey
 there,
 it's
 Rosie.
 Valentine's
 Day


is
 coming
 up
 this
 week
 and
 whether
 you


celebrate
 or
 not,
 love
 is
 in
 the
 air.


So,
 we
 wanted
 to
 reair
 one
 of
 our


all-time
 favorite
 episodes,
 the
 vibrator


episode.
 This
 one
 is
 chalk
 full
 of
 great


tips
 and
 recommendations
 for
 finding
 a


vibrator
 that
 will
 suit
 you
 or
 the


person
 you
 love.
 Heads
 up,
 some
 of
 our


picks
 have
 changed
 since
 we
 recorded


this
 episode.
 So,
 if
 you
 like
 the
 sound


of
 something
 we're
 talking
 about,
 make


sure
 you
 check
 the
 show
 notes
 for
 the


most
 up-to-date
 product
 links
 in
 that


category.
 Hope
 you
 enjoy
 it.
 Happy


Valentine's.


>> Christine,
 you're
 blushing.


>> I
 totally
 blushing.
 I
 feel
 so
 immature


right
 now.
 I've
 kind
 of
 been
 dreading


but
 super
 looking
 forward
 to
 this


episode
 because
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be


great
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 super


interesting.
 But
 I
 also
 know
 that
 maybe


my
 like
 family
 is
 going
 to
 listen.


>> Yeah.
 Please,
 mom,
 turn
 this
 off.


>> I
 love
 that
 right
 now
 we're
 just
 shaking


our
 sillies
 out.
 We're
 doing
 all
 the


vocal
 warmups,
 all
 the
 giggles
 because


today
 we're
 talking
 about
 vibrators.


>> That's
 right.
 We
 are
 talking
 about


vibrators.


>> And
 by
 the
 way,
 one
 of
 the
 most
 popular


guides
 on
 the
 wire
 cutter
 site
 all
 time.


People
 cannot
 get
 enough
 of
 this
 guide.


It
 is
 way
 way
 up
 at
 the
 top
 of
 what


people
 read
 on
 Wire
 Cutter
 all
 year


long,
 almost
 every
 day
 of
 the
 year.


>> They're
 just
 pulling
 up
 their
 little


private
 browsing
 page
 to
 Wire
 Cutter
 for


vibes.


>> I
 mean,
 we
 are
 laughing,
 right?
 But
 it's


also
 I
 think
 it
 it
 points
 to
 something


much
 deeper.
 Honestly,
 I
 think
 there's
 a


real
 hunger
 for
 this
 kind
 of
 straight


review
 on
 vibrators,
 well-
 tested,
 well


vetted
 options.
 And
 I
 I
 feel
 like


there's
 just
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 great
 sources


for
 that
 on
 the
 internet.
 And
 our
 writer


has
 tested
 so
 many
 vibrators
 for
 this


guide
 and
 tested
 with
 a
 wide
 group
 of


people.
 It's
 through
 the
 wire
 cutter


lens.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 right?
 It's
 given
 the
 sort
 of
 same


treatment
 that
 KitchenAid
 mixers
 or


rollway
 suitcases
 are.
 It's
 just
 a


harder
 thing
 maybe
 to
 crowdsource
 advice


on.
 So,
 I
 think
 some
 people
 crave
 it
 in


a
 guide,
 somewhere
 they
 can
 go,
 a


one-stop
 shop
 for
 really
 straightforward


advice
 about
 what
 you
 might
 want
 to
 look


for
 when
 you're
 going
 to
 make
 this


purchase
 cuz
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 aren't


cheap.


>> No,
 cannot
 return
 them.


>> So,
 who
 are
 we
 talking
 to


>> today?
 We
 are
 bringing
 in
 Wire
 Cutter's


MVP
 of
 sex
 toy
 coverage,
 our
 Yeah.
 Our


longtime
 sex
 toy
 writer.


>> Yeah.
 Today
 we're
 going
 to
 talk
 with


Bianca
 Alba
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 tell
 us


about
 the
 hang-ups
 people
 have
 when
 it


comes
 to
 sex
 toys
 and
 how
 they
 test
 for


our
 guide.
 And
 we'll
 run
 through
 a
 ton


of
 different
 types
 of
 vibrators
 and


advice
 on
 how
 to
 shop
 for
 them
 because


it
 can
 be
 kind
 of
 scary
 and


intimidating.
 Bianca
 is
 going
 to
 walk
 us


through
 exactly
 how
 to
 buy
 a
 vibrator


that
 you'll
 hopefully
 love.
 And
 they
 are


also
 going
 to
 dish
 on
 the
 things
 that


you
 really
 want
 to
 avoid
 because
 there


are
 some
 products
 out
 there
 that
 you


really
 just
 don't
 want
 to
 buy.
 Bianca's


brilliant.
 I'm
 pumped.


>> Next,
 we'll
 be
 back
 with
 Bianca,
 our
 sex


toy
 rider.
 See
 you
 in
 a
 sec.


Welcome
 back
 to
 the
 Wire
 Cutter
 Show.


Bianca
 Alba
 is
 a
 non-binary
 sexual


health
 educator
 with
 a
 master's
 in


public
 health
 and
 also
 works
 as
 a
 coach


and
 journalist.
 They're
 wire
 cutters,


sex
 toy
 writer,
 working
 on
 our
 guide
 to


vibrators
 since
 2014.
 They've
 also


written
 our
 guides
 to
 personal


lubricants,
 condoms,
 and
 anal
 toys,


among
 others.
 For
 the
 vibrator
 guide


alone,
 Bianca
 interviewed
 more
 than
 a


dozen
 experts
 and
 sex
 toy
 users
 and


tested
 about
 30
 vibrators.
 Bianca,


welcome
 to
 the
 Wire
 Cutter
 Show.


>> Hi,
 thanks
 for
 having
 me.
 Bianca,
 I've


got
 to
 ask.
 What
 is
 the
 most
 common


reaction
 that
 you
 get
 when
 people
 find


out
 you're
 at
 a
 restaurant,
 you're
 at
 a


party,
 wherever
 you
 are,
 people
 find
 out


that
 you
 review
 sex
 toys
 for
 a
 living.


Giggly,
 discomfort,
 or
 sometimes
 they


think
 I'm
 being
 provocative
 or
 seductive


and
 it's
 like,
 no,
 this
 is
 really
 my


job.
 And
 then
 when
 they
 find
 out
 that


I'm
 doing
 it
 for
 New
 York
 Times,
 they're


like,
 "The
 New
 York
 Times
 does
 what?"


You
 know,
 there's
 this
 kind
 of
 like


shock.


>> What
 are
 the
 eye
 roll
 reactions
 that
 you


usually
 get?


>> There
 was
 some
 guy
 that
 I
 was
 chatting


with
 and
 I
 said
 something
 about
 how
 I


had
 to
 work
 on
 the
 guide
 and
 he
 was


like,
 "Oh,
 do
 you
 want
 me
 to
 come
 over


and
 help
 you?"
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 do


you
 want
 do
 you
 want
 to
 help
 me
 set
 up
 a


a
 spreadsheet
 and
 email
 some
 vendors
 cuz


that's
 what
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 doing."


>> I
 would
 love
 a
 tour
 of
 the
 new
 Excel


assistant,


>> right?


I
 do
 actually
 want
 to
 talk
 a
 little
 bit


about
 the
 reactions
 that
 people
 have
 to


this
 guide,
 especially
 coming
 out
 of
 a


publication
 that
 that
 is
 part
 of
 the
 New


York
 Times
 company.
 Whenever
 we
 promote


this
 guide,
 we
 tend
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of


little
 jokes
 dropped
 on
 social
 media.


And
 even
 within
 the
 comment
 section
 of


the
 guide,
 we
 have
 certain
 people
 who


comment
 who
 seem
 to
 be
 sort
 of


scandalized
 that
 a
 publication
 from
 the


New
 York
 Times
 would
 be
 reviewing


vibrators.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 just


wondering
 why
 do
 you
 think
 this
 guide
 is


both
 so
 popular
 but
 also
 so
 polarizing?


There
 is
 a
 real
 double
 standard
 about


male
 sexuality.
 I
 mean
 because
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 discussion
 of
 stuff
 like
 Viagra


and
 condoms
 are
 not
 so
 taboo
 to
 discuss


but
 the
 idea
 that
 there
 is
 a
 product


that
 is
 specifically


just
 to
 give


a
 person
 with
 a
 vulva
 a
 clitoral
 orgasm


is
 like
 oh
 no
 it's
 either
 funny
 or


uncomfortable
 or
 titilating
 when
 I
 think


it's
 really
 just
 a
 part
 of
 health
 you


know
 healthy
 sexuality
 healthy


connection,
 healthy
 intimacy.
 For
 me,


what
 this
 guide
 is
 really
 about
 is


closing
 the
 orgasm
 gap.
 Like
 research


has
 shown
 that
 75%
 of
 people
 with


vulvas,
 namely
 heterosexual
 women,
 are


not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 have
 an
 orgasm


just
 from
 penetrative
 sex.
 And
 it's


there's
 sort
 of
 an
 expectation
 that
 they


should
 be
 able
 to.
 A
 lot
 of
 the
 time,


people
 need
 direct
 clitoral
 stimulation.


And
 a
 vibrator
 is
 a
 very
 effective
 way


to
 close
 the
 orgasm
 gap.
 This
 is


something
 I'm
 very
 passionate
 about
 as


an
 educator.
 Like
 I
 actually
 just
 got
 an


email
 from
 a
 75year-old
 woman
 who
 got


her
 first
 vibrator
 after
 looking
 at
 the


guide
 and
 she's
 like,
 "This
 is
 what
 I've


been
 missing
 out
 on
 all
 these
 years."


>> Wow.


>> At
 age
 75,
 having
 her
 first
 orgasm.
 So,


I
 hope
 for
 future
 generations
 that
 there


are
 fewer
 people
 who
 have
 to
 wait
 until


they're
 75
 years
 old
 to
 have
 their
 first


orgasm.
 Who
 are
 vibrators
 for?
 Broadly


speaking,


>> vibrators
 aren't
 just
 for
 people
 with


vulvas.
 The
 guide
 that
 I've
 written
 up


to
 this
 point
 has
 been
 focused
 on


vibrators
 for
 clitoral
 stimulation,
 but


that
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 they're
 only
 for


people
 with
 vulvas.
 Vibrators
 can
 also


be
 used
 on
 nipples.
 They
 can
 be
 used
 for


massage.
 Like
 the
 magic
 wand
 started
 out


as
 a
 massager.
 Historically,
 vibrators


were
 used
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 medical


applications.
 So,
 it's
 it's
 not
 just
 for


sexual
 titilation.
 It's
 it's
 a


stimulator.
 And
 they're
 increasingly


coming
 out
 with
 more
 vibrators
 that
 can


be
 used
 with
 penises
 or,
 you
 know,
 other


body
 parts.


>> And
 some
 don't
 even
 vibrate.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 I
 just
 came
 back
 from
 a
 big


trade
 show
 and
 there's
 also
 a
 lot
 of


suction
 toys
 now
 that
 fit
 over
 the


clitoris
 or
 nipples
 and
 and
 suction.


There
 are
 toys
 that
 thump.
 There
 are


toys
 that
 like
 flicker
 or
 oscillate.
 So,


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 emerging
 technology


about
 what's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 next
 big


thing
 in
 this
 industry
 in
 terms
 of


different
 people
 like
 different
 types
 of


stimulation.


So,
 for
 people
 who
 have
 never
 had
 the


chance
 of
 using
 a
 vibrator,
 um,
 in
 your


guide
 you
 recommend
 that
 people
 go
 to
 a


brickandmortar
 store,
 just
 like
 walk


right
 in
 and
 ask
 somebody
 for
 help.
 What


are
 some
 of
 the
 basic
 things
 that
 you


should
 ask
 if
 you
 really
 don't
 know


where
 to
 start?


>> So,


do
 maybe
 like
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 self


assessment
 beforehand
 about


what
 do
 you
 hope
 to
 get
 out
 of
 this


experience.
 Is
 this
 going
 to
 be
 solo


exploration?
 Is
 this
 going
 to
 be


something
 you
 use
 with
 a
 partner?
 Are


you
 trying
 to
 have
 your
 first
 orgasm?


Are
 you
 trying
 to
 just
 diversify


the
 types
 of
 stimulation
 you
 enjoy?
 And


maybe
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 clue
 about
 that,


but
 it
 will
 definitely
 make
 a
 it
 a


little
 bit
 easier
 if
 you
 go
 in
 having


some
 sense
 of
 what
 it
 is
 you
 want
 out
 of


the
 experience.
 And
 then
 from
 there,
 you


can
 talk
 to
 a
 sex
 educator
 employee
 of


one
 of
 these
 establishments
 and


hopefully
 they
 can
 guide
 you.


So,
 Bianca,
 can
 you
 tell
 us
 a
 little
 bit


about
 the
 different
 types
 of
 vibrators


that
 are
 out
 there
 and
 the
 ones
 that
 you


recommend?
 Because
 there's
 more
 than


just
 the
 one
 classic
 magic
 wand
 style,


right?
 So,
 depending
 on
 what
 you're


looking
 for,
 there
 are
 the
 big
 wand


vibrators.
 There
 are
 smaller
 kind
 of


like
 palmsized
 vibrators
 that
 are


specifically
 clitoral
 stimulators,
 but


you
 can
 also
 use
 them
 on
 other
 body


parts.
 And
 if
 you're
 wanting
 to
 use


them,
 say
 like
 in
 tandem
 with


intercourse,
 there
 are
 some
 that
 are


like
 really
 skinny
 or
 narrow,
 so
 they


don't
 really
 get
 in
 the
 way,
 which
 is


cool.
 And
 then
 we
 have
 more
 internalized


stimulators.
 So
 ones
 that
 are
 designed


to
 be
 used
 for
 anal
 or
 vaginal


penetration,
 G-spot
 or
 P-spot
 play.
 And


those
 can
 usually
 be
 used
 on
 other
 body


parts,
 too,
 but
 they're
 shaped
 in
 a
 way


that
 they
 can
 be
 used
 for
 penetration.


And
 then
 there
 are
 dual
 stimulators,


which
 is,
 you
 know,
 the
 classic
 rabbit


archetype
 where
 you
 have
 an
 internal


stimulating
 part
 and
 an
 external


stimulator.
 You
 know,
 that's
 great
 if


you
 want
 an
 all-in-one
 toy
 that
 gives


you
 a
 blended
 orgasm.


>> What
 happened
 to
 the
 rabbit?
 That
 was


the
 one
 that
 was
 really
 popular
 with
 my


friends
 when
 I
 was
 in
 college.


>> Yeah,
 it
 was
 like
 mainstream.
 It
 crossed


over.


>> Yeah.
 Never.


>> Yeah.
 That
 was
 because
 of
 a
 Sex
 in
 the


City
 episode.
 It
 kind
 of
 went
 viral


because
 of
 that.
 I
 had
 the
 original


Rabbit
 Pearl.
 It
 never
 really
 had
 enough


oomph
 for
 me
 personally,
 but
 it
 has
 led


to
 many
 new
 generations
 of
 dual


stimulators.


So,
 I
 mean,
 the
 rabbit
 is
 sort
 of
 like


the
 grandmother
 of
 a
 bunch
 of
 a
 whole


new
 generation
 of
 dual
 stimulator
 vibes.


And
 I
 think
 dual
 stimulator
 vibes
 can
 be


wonderful
 toys.
 There
 are
 a
 lot
 of


people
 who
 cannot
 have
 an
 orgasm
 just


from
 clitoral
 stimulation
 and
 if
 you


need
 the
 G-spot
 stimulation
 as
 well


rather
 than
 having
 two
 toys
 that
 you


have
 to
 use
 simultaneously
 using
 both


hands.
 The
 cool
 thing
 about
 the
 suction


rabbits
 is
 once
 you
 put
 it
 in
 it
 kind
 of


stays
 in
 place
 cuz
 the
 suction
 kind
 of


like
 locks
 onto
 you.
 So
 that's
 very


convenient.
 What
 are
 some
 examples
 of


the
 handheld
 type
 that
 you
 that
 you


mentioned?
 The
 one
 that's
 that
 kind
 of


fit
 in
 your
 palm.
 Like
 I
 think
 we
 have
 a


few
 recommendations
 in
 the
 guide
 right


now
 for
 those.


>> Sure.
 Our
 budget
 pick
 is
 the
 Satisfier


Purple
 Pleasure,
 which
 I
 think
 is
 about


$40
 on
 the
 the
 Satisfier
 site.
 So,
 it's


very
 affordable
 and
 it
 does
 fit
 in
 the


palm
 of
 your
 hand
 and
 has
 kind
 of a


rounded
 tapered
 tip.
 So,
 you
 know,
 it


fits
 between
 the
 vulva
 lips
 very
 nicely.


It's
 small.
 It's
 easy
 to
 like
 put
 in
 a


purse
 or
 in
 a
 bedside
 table
 drawer
 or


something
 like
 that.
 Like
 that's
 one
 of


the
 real
 advantages
 is
 that
 it's
 very


portable
 and
 it's
 rechargeable.
 So,
 it


doesn't
 have
 a
 cord.
 It's
 not
 bulky.
 I


think
 the
 other
 small
 picks
 we
 have
 is


the
 Dame
 Air,
 which
 is
 a
 suction


vibrator,
 which
 is
 also
 very
 small
 and


is
 great
 for
 partner
 play
 because
 it
 is


so
 narrow
 that
 it
 doesn't
 get
 in
 the


way,
 but
 also
 great
 for
 solo
 play.
 And


then
 we
 have
 the
 Lelo
 dot,
 which
 is
 very


unique
 and
 one
 of
 my
 personal
 favorites


because
 it's
 very
 pointy.
 So,
 it
 focuses


all
 of
 the
 vibration
 right
 at
 the
 tip
 at


this
 little
 pin
 point,
 which
 you
 can


direct.
 Um,
 there's
 been
 research
 that


shows
 that
 different
 people's
 clitorises


have
 different
 sensitivities
 on
 like
 I


always
 go
 on
 the
 left
 side.
 I'm
 sure


there
 are
 people
 who
 go
 on
 the
 right


side,
 but
 most
 people
 have
 more


sensitivity
 in
 more
 parts
 of
 their


clitoris
 than
 the
 others.
 So,
 it
 allows


you
 to
 target
 the
 stimulation
 exactly


where
 you
 want
 it.
 So,
 those
 are
 some


examples
 of
 handheld
 vibrators
 that
 we


currently
 have
 in
 our
 guide,
 like


smaller
 ones.
 Okay.
 So,
 what
 are
 some


strategies
 or
 ways
 that
 people
 can
 think


through
 how
 to
 choose
 between
 the


various
 options?
 Is
 it
 by
 price?
 Is
 it


by
 style
 of
 vibrator?
 Like,
 what
 do
 you


recommend?
 I
 think
 it's
 helpful
 if
 you


know
 what
 sort
 of
 intensity.
 I
 feel
 like


that's
 a
 really
 good
 place
 to
 start


because
 I
 would
 say
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 quote


unquote
 beginner
 options,
 the
 more


affordable,
 not
 all
 of
 them,
 but
 a
 lot


of
 them
 tend
 to
 be
 less
 powerful.


There's
 a
 sort
 of
 idea
 that
 if
 oh,
 if


this
 is
 your
 first
 vibrator,
 then
 you


don't
 want
 it
 to
 be
 as
 strong
 because


that's
 scary.
 But
 the
 reality
 is
 there


are
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 cannot
 have
 an


orgasm
 unless
 the
 vibrator
 is
 very


powerful.
 So
 they
 might
 buy
 this,
 you


know,
 $30
 bullet,
 and
 it
 just
 doesn't


get
 them
 anywhere.
 For
 me,
 my
 first
 sex


toy
 was
 the
 magic
 wand,
 which
 is
 one
 of


the
 most
 powerful
 ones
 on
 the
 market,


and
 that's
 usually
 the
 one
 I
 go
 to.
 So
 I


don't
 think
 that,
 oh,
 you're
 a
 beginner,


therefore
 you
 need
 a
 milder
 vibrator.
 I


don't
 think
 that's
 universally
 true.
 But


it's
 good
 to
 assess
 like
 am
 I
 someone


who's
 kind
 of
 ticklish?
 Is
 like
 a
 little


bit
 of
 stimulation
 a
 lot
 for
 me
 or
 am
 I


someone
 who's
 going
 to
 need
 a
 lot
 to
 get


over
 the
 edge
 just
 based
 on
 like


previous
 experiences?
 You
 know,
 if


you're
 someone
 who
 can
 masturbate
 with


your
 hand
 and
 have
 an
 orgasm
 in
 under
 2


minutes,
 then
 you
 might
 be
 fine
 with
 a


less
 powerful
 vibrator.
 You
 might
 need


less
 stimulation.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 if


you're
 someone
 where
 you're
 receiving


oral
 sex
 for
 an
 hour
 straight
 and
 you


still
 cannot
 get
 over
 the
 edge,
 then
 you


might
 want
 something
 that's
 a
 little


more
 powerful
 that
 gives
 you
 a
 little


more
 intensity.
 So,
 if
 you're
 more


sensitive
 or
 kind
 of
 in
 the
 middle,


maybe
 start
 with
 the
 budget
 pick,
 you


know,
 because
 it's
 not
 real
 high
 risk


and
 it
 works
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people.


If
 you
 want
 more
 power,
 go
 for
 the
 magic


wand.
 And
 honestly,
 I
 do
 recommend
 the


magic
 wand
 to
 everyone.
 Not
 everyone


loves
 it
 because
 there's
 no


oneizefits-all.


But
 the
 thing
 I
 always
 tell
 people
 is


even
 if
 you
 hate
 it
 as
 a
 sex
 toy,
 it's
 a


really
 good
 back
 massager.


So,
 you're
 not
 wasting
 your
 money.


>> That's
 really
 funny.


>> Yeah.
 Like,
 there
 are
 other
 things
 you


can
 use
 it
 for.


So,
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 worthwhile


investment.


>> You've
 brought
 up
 the
 magic
 wand
 a


couple
 of
 times.
 Can
 you
 describe
 what


that
 looks
 like?
 Cuz
 in
 my
 head,
 I
 think


I've
 seen
 it
 on
 the
 guide.
 Like,
 it


looks
 really
 big
 and
 it's
 kind
 of


intimidating.


>> It
 is
 big.
 It
 is
 big
 and
 it's
 kind
 of


ugly.
 It's
 like
 blue
 and
 white.
 When
 I


did
 my
 first
 iteration
 of
 the
 guide,
 a


lot
 of
 people
 gave
 feedback,
 oh,
 this
 is


ugly.
 This
 looks
 like
 a
 medical
 device.


This
 looks
 like
 a
 microphone.
 But


they've
 sort
 of
 owned
 that
 and
 that's


their
 brand.
 Like
 a
 lot
 of
 competitors


have
 been
 like,
 "Oh,
 well,
 we
 offer
 a


more
 elegant
 wand
 that's
 purple
 or
 black


or
 something
 like
 that."
 And
 Magic
 Wand


is
 like,
 "No,
 we
 have
 this
 really
 iconic


brand.
 Maybe
 it's
 kind
 of
 ugly
 and


clinical
 looking,
 but
 people
 recognize


it."
 So,
 yeah,
 it
 is
 huge.
 I
 don't
 know


exactly
 how
 big
 it
 is.


>> It's
 like
 very
 tall.
 I've
 seen
 I've
 seen


these
 before.
 They're
 very
 big.
 Um,
 the


magic
 wand
 has
 also
 been
 around
 for
 a


long
 time,
 right?
 I
 mean,
 it's
 like,


isn't
 it
 from
 like
 the
 '50s
 or


something?


>> I
 believe
 the
 1960s,
 but
 yeah,
 it
 is


manufactured
 by
 Hitachi,
 which
 is
 a


Japanese
 company,
 and
 it
 was
 originally


sold
 as
 a
 back
 massager,
 and
 then
 sex


educators
 like
 Betty
 Dodson
 kind
 of


helped
 popularize
 it
 as
 a
 sex
 toy.
 And


there's
 actually
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 academic


research
 done
 about
 women
 with
 an


orgasmia
 having
 their
 first
 orgasm
 using


Betty
 Dodson's
 strategy
 with
 the
 magic


wand.
 So,
 there
 has
 been
 scientific


research
 that
 shows
 that
 for
 people
 who


struggle
 to
 reach
 orgasm,
 the
 magic
 wand


is
 often
 the
 thing
 that
 gets
 them
 over


the
 edge.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 reasons
 why


it's
 been
 our
 top
 pick
 for
 a
 decade.


Yes,
 it
 is
 very
 powerful.
 But
 if
 you


need
 milder
 stimulation,
 you
 can
 do


something
 like
 put
 a
 blanket
 or
 towels


between
 your
 vulva
 and
 the
 wand
 and


that'll
 help
 kind
 of
 diffuse
 the


stimulation
 somewhat.
 And
 also
 like
 I


know
 lots
 of
 people
 with
 penises
 who


like
 it
 too.
 Like
 it's
 very
 versatile.


There
 are
 attachments.
 So
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 a
 bad
 first
 investment.
 And
 I
 think


if
 you
 get
 the
 corded
 version,
 you
 can


get
 that
 for
 under
 $100
 which
 is
 a
 very


reasonable
 price.
 And
 and
 what's
 like


the
 difference?
 Like
 why
 would
 you


choose
 corded
 versus
 battery?


Convenience,
 I
 guess.
 Like
 they've


released
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


iterations.


And
 the
 rechargeable
 one,
 you
 don't
 have


to
 deal
 with
 carrying
 the
 cord
 around,


but
 it
 is
 heavier
 because
 more
 of
 the


mechanism
 is
 internal.
 So
 I
 actually
 my


favorite
 one
 is
 the
 Magic
 One
 Plus,


which
 is
 the
 kind
 of
 upgraded
 fancier


corded
 one.
 It
 has
 a
 silicone
 head.
 It


has
 more
 settings.
 It
 has
 a
 detachable


cord
 because
 one
 of
 the
 issues
 with
 like


the
 older
 versions
 is
 that
 the
 cord


would
 fry
 out
 and
 then
 the
 thing
 was


done.
 Whereas
 this
 one,
 if
 the
 cord


wears
 out,
 you
 can
 just
 replace
 the
 cord


and
 still
 have
 the
 body
 of
 the
 toy
 work.


>> That's
 interesting.
 Sustainability,
 but


also
 accessibility.
 I
 think
 like
 the


idea
 of


>> having
 it
 be
 something
 that's
 heavier


could
 potentially
 be
 prohibitive.
 You're


speaking
 about
 using
 these
 toys.
 I'm


curious.
 You've
 tested
 a
 lot
 of


vibrators
 both
 for
 this
 guide
 and
 for


the
 guides
 that
 you've
 published
 in
 Wire


Cutter
 over
 the
 years.
 Describe
 your


testing
 process.
 What
 is
 it
 like?
 Well,


initially
 I
 do
 research.
 I
 just
 went
 to


a
 big
 trade
 show
 and
 I
 met
 all
 these


companies
 face
 to
 face
 which
 was
 amazing


because
 I
 can
 read
 reviews
 online
 and
 I


get
 a
 lot
 of
 information
 from
 seeing
 you


know
 what
 are
 the
 trends
 what
 are
 the


things
 that
 people
 are
 reviewing
 what's


on
 the
 different
 store
 websites
 but


actually
 getting
 to
 go
 in
 person
 and


talk
 to
 the
 people
 who
 designed
 it
 and


feel
 it
 on
 my
 hands
 and
 whatever
 is
 a


big
 game
 changer
 so
 I
 go
 through
 the
 the


research
 process
 I
 also
 where
 I
 am
 in


Chicago
 live
 close
 to
 early
 to
 bed


they're
 literally
 two
 blocks
 from
 my


house.
 I
 will
 just
 walk
 in
 there
 and
 I


will
 just
 play
 and
 I
 will
 talk
 to
 their


sex
 educators.
 It's
 an
 amazing
 resource


for
 me
 to
 have.
 I'm
 just
 lucky
 enough
 to


live
 right
 next
 to
 them.
 So,
 and
 then
 I


do
 research
 online.
 So,
 I
 am
 constantly


paying
 attention
 to
 like
 what
 has
 hype,


what
 is
 the
 things
 that
 are
 sticking


around.
 Like
 for
 example,
 suction


vibrators
 first
 emerged
 in
 2014
 with
 the


womanizer
 and
 that
 was
 a
 very


controversial
 thing.
 A
 lot
 of
 people


hate
 the
 name
 and
 the
 original
 iteration


was
 very
 tacky
 looking.
 It
 had
 a
 lot
 of


rhinestones
 and
 leopard
 print.
 It
 was
 a


very
 strange
 looking
 toy.
 But
 when
 that


first
 came
 out,
 people
 were
 so
 divided


about
 this
 new
 sensation
 that
 it
 was


suction
 and
 it
 was
 hard
 to
 to
 get
 your


hands
 on
 one.


>> And
 now
 suction
 vibrators
 are
 a
 huge


part
 of
 the
 industry
 and
 most
 companies


make
 one.
 So
 I'm
 just
 always
 looking
 for


what's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 next
 thing
 that


blows
 up.


You
 know,
 you
 referenced
 earlier
 the


spreadsheet.
 Can
 you
 explain
 a
 little


bit
 how
 you
 build
 out
 like
 a
 research


spreadsheet
 to
 keep
 all
 the
 information


in?


>> Sure.
 I
 have
 a
 spreadsheet
 with
 the
 list


of
 the
 toys.
 And
 then
 I
 keep
 track
 of


all
 the
 different
 criteria
 we're
 looking


at.
 So
 that
 might
 be
 like,
 okay,
 what


kind
 of
 warranty
 does
 it
 have?
 How
 long


does
 it
 take
 to
 charge?
 How
 long
 does
 it


hold
 a
 charge?
 And
 then
 I
 have
 to
 do
 a


battery
 test
 to
 see
 if
 that's
 actually


true.
 All
 the
 the
 different
 technical


things.
 And
 then
 I
 usually
 test
 it
 on
 my


own
 at
 least
 three
 or
 four
 times
 because


the
 first
 time
 I
 use
 a
 toy,
 especially


if
 it's
 a
 novel
 type
 of
 stimulation
 that


I'm
 not
 used
 to,
 I
 may
 not
 vibe
 with
 it.


And
 also
 I
 am
 a
 so
 I
 have
 a
 hormonal


cycle
 and
 I'm
 parmenopausal
 at
 this


point
 too.
 So,
 my
 sex
 drive
 can
 be
 kind


of
 variable
 and
 depending
 on
 where
 I
 am


in
 my
 cycle.
 If
 I'm
 on
 a
 low
 sex
 drive


day,
 it
 doesn't
 matter
 how
 good
 the
 toy


is,
 I
 might
 just
 not
 really
 be
 into
 it.


So,
 I
 try
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 everything
 I


test
 gets
 a
 fair
 shot
 for
 me.
 And
 a
 lot


of the
 time
 it's
 just
 like,
 okay,
 this


is
 nice.
 Or
 sometimes
 it
 is
 really


terrible,
 but
 most
 of the
 time
 it's
 just


like,
 okay.
 And
 then
 once
 in
 a
 while


I'll
 get
 something
 where
 I'm
 like,
 wow,


like
 this
 is
 a
 game
 changer.
 And
 at
 that


point,
 that's
 when
 we
 send
 it
 out
 to


secondary
 testers
 to
 be
 like,
 "Okay,


what
 do
 you
 think
 of
 it?"
 Because
 I'm


only
 one
 body,
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 I


am
 the
 authority
 on
 what
 toys
 are
 good,


but
 I've
 had
 I've
 had
 enough
 experience


testing
 things
 in
 these
 different


categories
 that
 I
 can
 be
 like,
 "Oh,


yeah,
 this
 is
 significantly
 more


powerful
 than
 what
 I've
 seen
 up
 to
 this


point,
 or
 this
 has
 this
 feature,
 which


is
 really
 new."
 So
 regardless
 of
 what
 my


personal
 physiology
 is,
 I'm
 able
 to


objectively
 compare


the
 features
 and
 the
 strength
 and
 the


qualities
 of
 of
 any
 toy
 that
 I
 test.


>> And
 you
 described
 yourself
 as
 Aphab,


meaning
 assigned
 female
 at
 birth.


>> Assigned
 female
 birth.
 Yeah.
 Um,
 which


begs
 the
 question,
 the
 testers,
 the


folks
 you
 are
 sort
 of
 crowdsourcing
 for


information,
 is
 there
 a
 broad
 diversity


of
 folks
 you're
 testing
 with
 so
 that


you're
 getting
 as
 wide
 array
 of
 feedback


as
 possible
 for
 each
 product?


Absolutely.
 We
 try
 to
 test
 across
 the


lifespan.
 I
 haven't
 had
 a
 chance
 to
 work


with
 testers
 in
 their
 60s
 or
 70s
 yet,


although
 that
 might
 be
 something
 I
 get


to
 do
 in
 future
 because
 I've
 connected


with
 some
 really
 cool
 actually
 cougars


that
 I
 met
 at
 a
 sex
 club
 in
 Toronto.
 So,


we're
 like,
 "Oh,
 yeah.
 We
 want
 to
 test."


And
 these
 are
 ladies
 in
 their
 60s
 and


70s
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "That
 would
 be
 so


cool
 to
 work
 with
 seniors
 who
 are
 really


like
 excited
 about
 vibrators."
 But
 up
 to


this
 point,
 I
 would
 say
 it's
 been
 people


in
 their
 20s,
 30s,
 40s,
 50s
 at
 this


point.
 So,
 I'm
 trying
 to
 get
 a
 range.
 We


did
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an
 audit
 recently


where
 I
 was
 like,
 I
 want
 to
 get
 more


input
 about


what
 is
 criteria
 for
 a
 good
 sex
 toy
 for


trans
 women
 who
 have
 either
 had
 gender


affirming
 surgery
 or
 not.
 And
 so,
 I
 did


a
 lot
 of
 research
 on
 that.
 I
 did
 a
 lot


of
 research
 on
 what
 are
 good
 sex
 toys


for
 Aphab
 people
 who
 are
 permenopausal


or
 menopausal.
 How
 do
 the
 needs
 shift?


And
 also
 disability
 accessibility.
 So,


you
 know,
 maybe
 people
 who
 have
 limited


grip
 strength.
 There
 are
 a
 lot
 of


different
 considerations
 for
 different


folks
 about
 what's
 going
 to
 make
 a
 good


toy.
 So,
 I
 interviewed
 a
 lot
 of
 people


and
 we
 have
 limited
 space,
 but
 I'm


trying
 to
 incorporate
 more
 information


about,
 okay,
 in
 addition
 to
 everything


else
 about
 this
 toy,
 it
 is
 great
 if
 you


have
 arthritis
 in
 your
 hands
 because
 the


handle
 is
 shaped
 a
 certain
 way
 or
 this


works
 equally
 well
 with
 penises
 as
 it


does
 with
 vulvas,
 you
 know.
 So,
 we're


trying
 to
 make
 it
 as
 inclusive
 as


possible
 in
 the
 limited
 space
 that
 we


have
 for
 the
 guide.


What
 I'm
 hearing
 here
 is
 if
 you
 want
 to


buy
 a
 vibrator,
 the
 first
 place
 to
 start


is
 to
 kind
 of
 understand
 what
 you
 like


either
 in
 partnered
 or
 solosex
 to
 help


you
 figure
 out
 what
 type
 of
 vibrator
 you


might
 want
 to
 get.
 And
 if
 you
 can
 access


a
 physical
 store,
 it's
 a
 great
 idea
 to


go
 in
 and
 kind
 of
 try
 things
 out
 on
 your


hand.
 And
 if
 you're
 lost,
 just
 get
 the


magic
 wand.
 We're
 going
 to
 take
 a
 quick


break
 and
 then
 when
 we
 come
 back,
 we'll


talk
 through
 things
 to
 avoid
 when


shopping
 for
 a
 vibrator
 and
 why
 you


shouldn't
 give
 up
 on
 a
 vibrator
 if
 you


don't
 really
 love
 it
 the
 first
 time


around.
 Be
 right
 back.


Welcome
 back
 to
 the
 Wire
 Cutter
 Show.


Today
 we're
 talking
 about
 vibrators.
 Our


guest
 is
 Bianca
 Alba,
 Wire
 Cutters,
 sex


toy
 writer
 for
 over
 a
 decade.
 Now
 we're


going
 to
 get
 into
 some
 of
 the
 things
 to


avoid
 and
 what
 to
 do
 if
 you
 don't
 end
 up


liking
 the
 vibrator
 you
 buy.
 It's
 really


interesting
 because
 at
 Wire
 Cutter,


we're
 always
 coming
 across
 knockoffs
 for


all
 kinds
 of
 things.
 people
 don't
 want


to
 spend
 that
 much
 money.
 But
 I
 think


nowadays
 it's
 just
 it's
 a
 hazard
 when


you're
 trying
 to
 shop
 online.
 So
 to
 that


end,
 Bianca,
 are
 there
 knockoff


vibrators
 being
 sold
 out
 there?


>> Absolutely.
 Especially
 when
 you're
 using


a
 retailer
 like
 Amazon.
 You
 know,
 you


can
 buy
 sex
 toys
 on
 like
 Tamu
 and


Alibaba
 now,
 too.


So
 yeah,
 you
 do
 want
 to
 be
 careful


especially
 in
 terms
 of
 like
 what


materials
 they're
 using
 because
 it
 might


say
 it's
 silicone
 on
 the
 package
 but


it's
 actually
 something
 else
 and
 there's


issues
 with
 like
 materials
 offging


chemicals
 like
 phalates.
 You
 know
 those


materials
 also
 harbor
 bacteria


and
 can
 lead
 to
 infections.
 So,
 you
 want


to
 make
 sure
 that
 you're
 getting
 a


genuine
 product
 that's
 actually
 what
 it


says
 it
 is.
 And
 you
 might
 have
 issues


with
 longevity,
 too.
 You
 know,
 if
 you


buy
 a
 cheaper
 model,
 it's
 going to
 break


in
 a
 few
 months.
 So,
 it's
 worth
 spending


the
 extra
 money
 to
 get
 an
 authentic


product.


>> And
 what
 are
 the
 telltale
 signs
 that
 you


might
 be
 buying
 a
 knockoff?


>> I
 would
 say
 the
 main
 thing
 to
 look
 out


for
 is
 if
 the
 price
 is
 too
 good
 to
 be


true.
 So,
 if
 you
 see
 something
 that's


claiming
 to
 be
 a
 magic
 wand,
 but
 it's


$30
 when
 the
 product
 usually
 retails
 for


$130,


that's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 the
 real
 deal.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 kind
 of
 true
 of
 all
 things.


>> That
 may
 be
 true.
 Too
 cheap
 to
 be
 true.


>> Yeah.
 Like,
 plan
 to
 invest,
 you
 know,


ballpark
 100
 bucks
 to
 get
 something


really
 good.
 Maybe
 you
 can
 find


something
 for
 50,
 maybe
 it's
 150.
 And


also
 look
 at
 the
 warranty
 because


some
 brands
 offer
 really
 great
 five
 or


10
 year
 warranties.
 And
 that
 way
 as
 long


as
 you
 know
 it's
 like
 a
 long-term


investment
 that
 might
 be
 worth
 a
 little


bit
 more
 money
 knowing
 that
 if
 it
 breaks


you
 can
 get
 a
 replacement.


What
 if
 you
 buy
 a
 vibrator
 and
 you
 just


don't
 like
 it?
 You
 can't
 take
 it
 back.


What
 do
 you
 advise
 people
 do
 then?
 I


would
 say


don't
 dismiss
 it
 on
 the
 first
 try.
 I
 had


my
 first
 orgasm
 using
 shower
 head
 to
 be


perfectly
 honest
 and
 it
 took
 me
 a
 while


to
 acclimate
 to
 a
 different
 type
 of


stimulation


because
 I
 was
 used
 to
 having
 an
 orgasm


with
 water
 basically
 from
 water


pressure.
 Switching
 to
 a
 vibrator
 felt


very
 different
 and
 initially
 I
 wasn't


really
 a
 fan
 of
 it.
 So,
 I
 think
 it's


important
 to
 remember
 that
 your
 body


kind
 of
 has
 a
 learning
 curve.
 And
 it


could
 be
 that
 like
 if
 you
 don't
 like
 a


toy,
 you
 don't
 like
 a
 toy.
 And
 that's


fine.
 But
 don't
 dismiss
 it
 without


giving
 it
 a
 couple
 tries
 unless
 it's


like
 painful
 or
 like
 you
 really
 gives


you
 a
 sensory
 ick
 or
 something
 like


that.
 But
 if
 you're
 just
 kind
 of
 like


meh,
 revisit
 it.
 Try
 it
 using
 it


different
 ways.
 You
 know,
 add
 lube.
 Try


it
 with
 a
 partner.
 Maybe
 it's
 fun
 as
 a


teasing
 or
 warm-up
 toy.
 Or
 maybe
 try
 it


on
 a
 different
 body
 part.
 There
 might
 be


some
 other
 way
 that
 it's
 more


pleasurable
 or
 a
 different
 type
 of


purpose
 that
 it
 can
 serve
 for
 you.


>> So,
 what
 if
 you
 just
 really
 don't
 like


it?
 You
 just
 throw
 it
 away.


>> Okay,
 this
 is
 where
 things
 get
 messy.


There's
 not
 really
 a
 lot
 of
 good


information
 about
 what
 to
 do
 with
 toys,


how
 to
 dispose
 of
 them,
 because
 a
 lot
 of


them
 contain
 lithium
 batteries,
 and
 so


you
 can't
 really
 throw
 it
 in
 the


garbage.
 There's
 an
 artist
 who's
 like


building
 a
 house
 out
 of
 sex
 toys.


>> Like,
 she's
 collecting
 sex
 toys
 to
 build


this
 art
 project
 as
 a
 statement
 about


how
 to
 dispose
 of
 them.
 Because
 I
 have


to
 test
 so
 many
 sex
 toys.
 I
 will


disinfect
 them
 with
 bleach
 and
 rehome


them
 with
 friends.
 And
 I
 realize
 that's


not
 for
 everyone,
 but
 I
 go
 through
 so


many
 toys.


>> Well,
 now
 you
 know
 that
 you
 have
 another


option
 which
 is
 to
 build
 a
 house.


>> To
 build
 a
 house
 and
 with
 the
 crisis,


you
 know.


>> Exactly.


>> That
 is
 not
 our
 official
 guidance.


>> It's
 not
 our
 official
 guidance
 in
 the


guidance.
 Not
 our
 official
 guidance


here,
 but
 it's
 not
 official.
 But
 we
 also


we
 do
 have
 a
 guide
 I
 think
 on
 the
 site


for
 how
 to
 clean
 sex
 toys.
 So
 that
 might


be
 a
 good
 resource
 for
 folks
 too.


>> Yes.
 Yes.


>> Bianca,
 you
 did
 this
 really
 really
 good


ask
 me
 anything
 on
 Reddit
 about


vibrators.
 So
 we
 thought
 we'd
 bring
 some


of
 those
 here
 as
 a
 lightning
 round.
 Are


you
 up
 for
 it?


>> Okay,
 I'll
 do
 my
 best.


>> Question
 number
 one,
 what
 do
 you
 advise


if
 buying
 for
 a
 partner?


>> Talk
 to
 your
 partner.
 So,
 I
 had
 this


conversation
 with
 um
 the
 owner
 of
 Early


Toed
 and
 she
 says
 there
 are
 so
 many


times
 that
 like
 men
 will
 buy
 a
 vibrator


for
 their
 female
 partner
 and
 just


surprise
 them
 with
 it
 and
 it's
 like,


"Oh,
 she
 didn't
 like
 it.
 Now
 I
 want
 to


return
 it."
 And
 it's
 like,
 "Did
 you
 even


ask
 her
 if
 she
 wanted
 this?"


>> So,
 not
 a
 good
 surprise
 gift.


>> Yeah.
 Not
 a
 good
 surprise
 gift.
 Like,
 if


you
 have
 a
 relationship
 where
 sex
 toys


is
 already
 a
 part
 of
 it
 and
 you
 use
 sex


toys
 regularly
 and
 you
 know
 each
 other's


tastes,
 that's
 fine.
 But
 I
 would
 say


that
 like
 make
 that
 decision
 together


and
 work
 together.
 Like
 if
 you're
 like,


"Hey,
 I
 want
 to
 buy
 you
 a
 sex
 toy.
 Let


the
 person
 pick
 out
 and
 pay
 for
 it


rather
 than
 just
 picking
 something
 out


and
 being
 like,
 "Here,
 use
 this."
 You


know,


>> kind
 of
 like
 an
 engagement
 ring.


>> Yeah.


>> Yes.
 Absolutely.


>> Wow.
 People
 are
 going
 to
 come
 for
 us
 in


the
 comments.


>> What?


>> Yeah.
 Okay.
 Question
 number
 two.
 Does


size
 actually
 matter
 with
 vibrators
 or


is
 it
 just
 about
 how
 you
 use
 them?
 Okay,


it
 depends
 on
 whether
 this
 is
 an


external
 vibrator,
 an
 internal
 vibrator.


Everyone
 has
 different
 preferences.
 I


would
 say
 with
 external
 vibrators,
 if


you
 want
 more
 power,
 it's
 probably
 going


to
 be
 bigger
 cuz
 it's
 going
 to
 need
 a


bigger
 motor.
 With
 internal
 vibrators,


everyone
 has
 their
 size
 preference.
 So,


I
 don't
 think
 that
 bigger
 is
 better


unless
 you
 like
 bigger.


>> Got
 it.
 Okay,
 your
 last
 question.
 What


type
 of
 lube
 should
 you
 use
 with
 a


vibrator?
 It
 depends
 on
 what
 type
 of


vibrator
 you
 have.
 So,
 anything
 that's


silicone,
 there
 are
 issues
 with
 using


silicone
 toys
 with
 silicone
 lube
 cuz
 the


molecules
 can
 bond
 and
 cause
 the
 toy
 to


warp.
 So,
 I
 would
 say
 that
 like


water-based
 lube
 is
 generally
 a
 safe


bet.
 Oil
 based
 lubes
 can
 sometimes


damage
 mechanized
 toys.
 So,
 I
 just,
 you


know,
 default
 to
 the
 water-based
 if


you're
 going
 to
 use
 lube
 with
 your
 toys,


which
 I
 do
 recommend
 you
 use
 lube
 with


your
 toys.


Before
 we
 wrap,
 we
 always
 ask
 our
 guests


one
 last
 question.
 So,
 Bianca,
 what
 was


the
 last
 product
 that
 you
 bought
 that


you
 absolutely
 love?
 Okay,
 the
 thing
 I'm


currently
 obsessed
 with,
 it's
 this


little
 blender
 that's
 called
 the
 Beast


Blender.
 And
 it's
 like
 a
 mini
 smoothie


blender
 that
 maybe
 holds
 12
 ounces
 of


liquid
 cuz
 I
 was
 making
 smoothies
 in
 my


Vitamix
 and
 I'd
 always
 end
 up
 with
 like


three
 quarts
 worth
 of
 smoothies
 to
 put


all
 the
 stuff
 in
 it
 that
 I
 thought
 I


wanted
 in
 my
 smoothie.
 I
 would
 have
 too


much
 smoothie
 and
 this
 itty
 bitty


blender,
 I
 actually
 get
 one
 smoothie
 or


one
 coffee
 frappe
 out
 of
 it
 and
 it's


just
 like
 my
 new
 obsession.
 I'm
 making


myself
 drinks
 with
 it
 all
 day
 long.
 I
 do


not
 recommend
 it
 as
 a
 sex
 toy.
 That


would
 be
 a
 one
 time
 use
 as
 a
 sex
 toy.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much,
 Bianca.
 It's
 been


great
 to
 chat
 with
 you.


>> It's
 been
 wonderful.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> All
 right,
 guys.
 We
 kept
 it
 in.
 We
 kept


our
 giggles
 in


>> for
 now.


>> For
 now.


>> And
 we
 learned.


>> And
 we
 learned
 a
 lot.
 Oh
 my
 goodness.


There
 were
 so
 many
 things
 that
 Bianca


shared
 that
 I
 didn't
 know
 before.
 So,


what
 are
 your
 takeaways
 from
 this


episode?
 If
 all
 else
 fails,
 your
 magic


wand
 can
 be
 a
 back
 massage,


>> right?
 The
 original
 use
 of
 the
 magic


wand,
 it
 can
 just
 be
 that.
 Again,


>> I
 think
 my
 big
 takeaway
 was
 it
 Socrates


know
 thyself?


>> Yes.


>> I
 assume
 Socrates
 was
 indeed
 talking


about
 um
 vibrators.


>> Duh.


>> He
 fact
 checked
 me.
 But
 um
 no,
 but
 just


this
 idea
 that
 in
 order
 to
 sort
 of
 wade


into
 this
 wide
 world
 of
 vibrators,
 it's


important
 to
 understand
 what
 you


want.


>> Yeah,
 I
 like
 that
 too.
 I
 think
 my


takeaway
 is
 that
 if
 you
 at
 first
 do
 not


like
 it,
 try
 try
 again.
 And
 that
 thing


Bianca
 said
 about
 how
 a
 person's
 body


can
 change
 throughout
 the
 month,
 I
 I


think
 sometimes
 as
 a
 culture
 we
 sort
 of


ignore
 that.
 That's
 just
 not
 part
 of
 the


conversation.
 So,
 I
 think
 that
 was


really
 interesting
 that
 maybe
 if
 you


don't
 like
 something
 at
 first,
 try
 it
 at


a
 different
 time
 of
 the
 month.
 Maybe


you're
 stressed,
 try
 it
 on
 vacation
 and


then
 if
 you
 don't
 like
 it,
 then
 give
 it


up.


>> It's
 true.
 So
 many
 great
 insights
 from


Bianca.
