Tell me about yourself.
Four simple words that can make
anyone ramble or freeze.
Even people at the top
of their game can go blank
when they hear those dreaded words.
So what does that mean?
Does your introduction
really make that big of a difference?
I never thought it did.
I thought my introduction wasn't nearly
as important as my qualifications.
For example, right after
I started my business,
I had the perfect opportunity to shine.
I was interviewing as an instructor
for Supply Chain Institute,
and I knew I was the ideal candidate.
I had over 20 years of expertise
leading supply chains
for one of the world's largest
consumer products companies.
As a prep for my interview,
I didn't want there to be any doubts
about my qualifications.
I created an elevator pitch
and included a complete list
of my accomplishments.
When I heard "Tell me about yourself,"
I was ready, and I proudly explained
everything that I could do.
When I finished, the interviewer said,
"Instead of talking about yourself,
it would have been more effective
if you had explained
what you can do for me."
My interview lasted five minutes.
She rejected me on the spot
based off of one answer.
That was my wake-up call.
I realized it doesn't matter
how smart you are,
it doesn't matter
how perfect a fit you are,
if you can't capture someone's attention.
After that, I became laser-focused
on cracking the code
on introducing myself.
I studied the science
of first impressions.
I researched viral headlines
and what made them so irresistible.
And then, I discovered the secret
of introducing myself perfectly
in 20 words or less.
Fast-forward about six months.
I'm having coffee
with the executive director
of a business-development program.
She asks me, "What do you do?"
I answer her in one sentence:
"I'm a communications consultant
and I help people with something to say
but struggle to say it."
She leans in and says three magic words.
"Tell me more."
Fifteen minutes later,
she hires me to give workshops
for new entrepreneurs.
But here's the thing.
I was the same person who blew
that interview just six months before.
But this time, I got the job,
even though I had way fewer qualifications
and the only thing different
between success and failure,
between that door of opportunity
opening or slamming shut in my face,
was my introduction.
From that point on, I started to see
my introduction in a whole new light.
It wasn't just a way
of grabbing someone's attention.
I thought about all those times
when I would hear "no,"
and my inner critic would tell me
that people didn't see me or hear me
because I wasn't good enough
or smart enough.
But that was wrong. It wasn't me.
It was my introduction.
Alright, are you ready
to introduce yourself in 20 words or less?
I'm going to start with two secrets
of getting people to say "tell me more."
Secret number one:
Think sound bite, not data dump.
That’s because with today’s
multitasking attention-deficit audiences,
it's been said you have a better chance
of engaging with a goldfish
than the person that you’re talking to.
A 20-word introduction is designed
to grab someone’s attention
and get them to say "tell me more."
Secret number two.
Do you remember
what that interviewer told me?
"Don't talk about yourself."
Instead, explain what you can do for them.
I call it the difference between
an “about-me” versus 
an “about-you” introduction.
An about-me introduction sounds like this:
"I'm an award-winning,
best-selling author."
Compare that to "I help
new authors get published faster."
Can you hear the difference?
One describes me, the other describes
what I can do for you.
Now that you know the secrets,
here are five ways to introduce yourself
perfectly in 20 words or less.
I'm going to start
with a straightforward
about-you introduction.
The formula is "I help
my target audience achieve
a benefit they desire."
For example,
"I help worried job hunters
confidently explain
why they're the ideal candidate to hire."
Now, here's a tip about your "benefit."
A benefit answers your listeners' question
"How will my life be different?"
For the second framework,
let's go beyond offering a benefit.
Let's promise a breakthrough.
The formula is the same
as the benefit one,
but you're going to add
the word "without."
"I help my target audience
achieve a benefit they desire
without negative consequence."
"I help establish brands
in competitive markets,
rapidly reach new audiences
without increasing marketing spend."
The word "without" is so powerful
because that's how you explain
what makes you unique.
For the last three frameworks,
here's what to say if you don't want
to focus on your career.
For example, you're mission-driven,
or you're on a career pivot.
Maybe you're a student
and you don't have
a lot of work experience.
In this case, you can use your passion,
your mission or your strength.
I'll start with your passion.
"I'm passionate about something I value
to achieve something
my target audience values."
"I'm passionate
about helping people in need
and creating opportunities
that change lives."
Next, instead of your passion,
you can use your strength.
"I'm known for my strength
to achieve something
my target audience values."
"I'm known for my critical thinking
and turning information
into actionable insights."
Last, you can use your mission.
“I’m on a mission to -- to achieve
something my target audience values.”
"I'm on a mission
to bridge the healthcare divide
and make a lasting difference
for vulnerable communities."
And that's how you use your passion,
your mission or your strength.
Now that you've seen
the five introductions,
your next step -- try them out.
Don't be surprised if you find yourself
using more than one.
That's because different audiences
value different things,
so what works for one
may not work for another.
But that's OK.
You'll see there are multiple ways
of getting people to say "tell me more."
I'll close with this thought:
Have doors been closed in your face?
Do you struggle to be seen and heard?
Does your inner critic tell you
you're not good enough or smart enough,
or that you're an imposter
and something is way above your pay grade?
Before you buy into your inner
critic's narrative, let me challenge you.
What if?
What if that voice
inside your head is wrong?
What if you are good enough
and smart enough?
What if the best way
to describe you is "impressive"?
Not "imposter."
And what if the only thing
between you and being seen,
heard and recognized
is your introduction
in 20 words.
