You may have heard a lot
about rewilding recently.
It conjures up visions of vast landscapes,
reintroductions of wolves,
great herds of bison.
It’s the most important message
we can hear at the moment:
that nature can restore itself,
given the chance.
But it doesn't have to be at vast scale,
and it doesn't have to be
in the middle of nowhere.
Rewilding can happen in your own backyard,
in an urban park,
anywhere there's a tiny
patch of space for it.
And it can happen really fast.
And that's transformative,
not just for nature and the climate,
but for ourselves.
How do I know?
Well, for the past couple of decades,
I've been helping to rewild big and small.
When my husband was 21,
he inherited 3,500 acres of farmland
in the busy southeast of England.
Knepp Estate is on the worst possible land
for intensive agriculture.
It was already losing money.
But Charlie had trained as a farmer,
and so for 17 years
he tried to turn it around.
By 1999, we were
1.5 million pounds in debt.
We knew we had to do
something radically different.
We wanted to work with nature
rather than battling
against it all the time.
We began to rewild.
Europe, like Africa and all the other
continents of the world,
was once home to vast numbers
of free-roaming animals,
animals that we hunted
to extinction or close to it.
Their disturbances shaped the land.
They cleared forests,
they opened up wetlands
and created grasslands,
they stimulated the soil,
they spread seeds.
We were really excited
by large-scale rewilding projects
happening in Europe
that were showing
that by introducing these animals
back into the landscape,
that nature could recover,
that biodiversity could rocket.
But could it actually happen
at smaller scale?
Could it happen on a farm like ours
that had been ploughed
and drenched with chemicals for decades?
Could we bring our own land back to life?
The first steps were so much fun.
We pulled up all the internal fences,
we smashed up the Victorian drains,
we allowed the water to sit
where it had always wanted to sit,
and the fields began
to scrub up with thorny bushes,
and soon trees began to recolonize.
And then we ring-fenced the whole area
and began to introduce
our free-roaming animals.
Old English longhorn cattle
for their extinct ancestor, the aurochs.
Exmoor ponies for the extinct tarpan.
Tamworth pigs for wild boar.
Red and fallow deer,
and eventually beavers.
(Laughter)
The results were
beyond our wildest dreams.
Everywhere these animals went,
life surfaced in their wake.
Our land became a kaleidoscope
of complex, shifting habitats,
the kind of messy margins
that wildlife loves.
Soon we were hearing
nightingales and turtle doves,
birds on the verge
of extinction in Britain.
We had bats and owls and dung beetles
and butterflies homing in on us
as if out of nowhere.
And our soil was restoring too.
So suddenly, we're pulling down
vast amounts of carbon,
whereas before, under the plough,
we'd just been releasing it.
And all of this happened in five years.
We looked at our land in amazement.
It was like it was breathing
a sigh of relief.
And so were we.
Suddenly, we could just sit back
and watch the miracle
of the Earth restoring itself.
Of course, we couldn't just let
the numbers of animals
grow and grow in our small project.
Biodiversity flourishes
when there are neither
too many grazing animals nor too few.
In vast wilderness areas,
nature takes care of this herself.
But we don't have wolves and lynx
and bears in the southeast of England.
So we had to become the apex predator.
And that meant suddenly we had
an income stream that surprised us.
We had wild range meat.
And together with wildlife tourism,
it's become one of the ways
that we can finance rewilding.
It's turned the fortunes
of the estate around.
Inspired by Knepp,
hundreds of thousands of acres
are now rewilding in the UK
on land that isn't suitable
for intensive modern agriculture.
But of course, not everybody
has hundreds of acres to play with.
And soon we were receiving
messages from people
who had seen the magic of Knepp,
but wanted to know if they could
rewild their back garden,
their schoolyard, their urban park.
Yes you can.
Our house has a Victorian walled garden
of about an acre in size
that for years was dominated
by a monoculture lawn.
Lawns have become an obsession
the world over ever since the 1950s,
when artificial fertilizer and weedkillers
and mowing machines
became available to everyone.
We looked again at our high-carbon,
high-maintenance green desert
and wondered why on Earth we had it.
Three years ago, we decided to rewild it.
It's become a wildlife haven.
In just three years,
biodiversity has increased 35 percent.
Rewilding a garden isn't
about simply closing the garden gate
and letting it go.
It takes intentional interventions
to create the right balance of plants
and to create the kind
of habitats that wildlife loves.
So this is what we've learned.
These are our three top tips
for making your green space
and garden wilder.
First, the Earth is not flat.
In nature, there are mounds
of anthills and molehills
and pits made by pigs
and wallows made by rolling bison.
Creating lumps and bumps
produces patches of sun and shade
and damp and dry,
which create conditions for a much
wider spectrum of plants,
and that creates many more
opportunities for wildlife.
We happened to have
some old farm buildings
that we were demolishing nearby
so we asked the diggers
if they would come and dump
hundreds of tons
of crushed brick and concrete
onto our perfected lawn.
You may have a patio
or a piece of concrete
or tarmac that you can pull up.
Crush it up and mix it with sand,
and you have the perfect free-draining
medium for a dry garden.
In a dry garden, you can have
plants like wildflowers
that really love poor soil conditions.
And because you're not having
to water and fertilize,
you're saving yourself
a lot of time and money.
But you're also helping the planet.
We've planted 1,100 different plants,
mostly from arid parts of the world,
but you don't have to have that many.
You can make an enormous impact
just by choosing plants that insects love,
and by extending the pollinating
and nectar season
and supporting forgotten creatures
like night-flying moths,
some of our greatest pollinators.
And all of these plants
are rubbing shoulders
with our native self-seeding wildflowers.
We vowed never to use the word weed again.
You can learn to love
your dandelions and clover.
Second, think like a herbivore.
The job of a gardener is never
to allow one single plant to dominate.
If you do, you lose all those plants
that are creating species
richness in your garden.
So when you're pulling out the thugs,
think of yourself as a wild boar,
rooting out those docks and thistles.
And when you're pruning
your roses or your climbers,
you're the nibbling teeth of a deer.
Thinking of yourself as an animal
in an ecosystem is incredibly freeing.
It allows you to become
more holistic and organic.
It allows you to get messier.
There's still room
for a lawn in the wilder garden,
but think of it as part of the mosaic.
Consider a wildflower or a chamomile lawn.
And when you mow, be the cow.
Graze very tightly in some areas,
but allow others to stay long,
providing protection
for small mammals and birds.
Mix it up, grow a Mohican.
Finally, find life in death.
In nature, death is a primary
source of life.
But in a garden, we get rid
of anything that dies.
Leaving dead wood and piles
of leaves is fantastic habitat,
but it also creates natural fertilizer
for next year's growth.
And leaving seedheads
instead of obsessively deadheading
provides really important food
for birds over winter.
In the UK, we have
23 million private gardens
covering an area four
and a half times the amount of land
that is designated
to national nature reserves,
and most of those gardens
are dominated by a green desert lawn.
Imagine if all those gardeners
thought differently,
if they put away the artificial
fertilizer and the herbicides
and began to think of themselves
as a keystone species,
as a mole or an ant or an earthworm.
Like this amazing city gardener
who's become obsessed with bees,
everything from bumblebees
to sharp-tailed bees
to leafcutter bees to masonry bees.
We tend to think of bees
as aggressive and scary,
but if you watch them,
they're just gentle, sensitive creatures
going about their business.
You can fall in love with them.
This is our neighbor's garden,
now attracting nightingales
and tawny owls.
We can rewild balconies in cities,
even in high-rise blocks.
Even a window box
can become a nature reserve.
And cemeteries and churchyards,
and bus shelters
and whole streets.
We can rewild our public monuments.
This is the Tower of London,
now a wildflower meadow heaving with bees.
And this is the Field Museum in Chicago,
once a green desert
and now a vital food stop
for birds on migration.
We can have whole tower blocks
erupting in plants,
bringing life to our windowsills,
capturing carbon, producing oxygen,
cleaning the air,
insulating us in winter,
cooling us down in summer.
So much of rewilding
is about changing the aesthetic.
It's about questioning what we've always
been taught to think of as beautiful
and normal and stable.
It's about shedding our obsessions,
particularly our desire
to be always in absolute control.
Rewilding is about embracing
the messy and the unpredictable.
It's about letting go.
It's about rewilding ourselves.
Thank you.
