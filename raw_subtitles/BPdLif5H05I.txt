Imagine making a business decision. Maybe hiring, maybe budgeting, maybe speaking up on a social issue. Any one of those choices gets far a public backlash. Put straight on your T, or even shake investment confidence. That's the reality for leaders today. Economic shocks, political uncertainty, polarization have created an environment where even routine decisions can carry real risk. In today's climate, expertise can help you map a strategy. When the road ahead is unclear, the stakes are personal, the fall is public, and your people are looking to you for guides. Courage is what will carry you through. To be clear, I'm not talking about bravery, that one-off heroic act. Courage is dominant. It's like a muscle. You build by acting on your values, even when there's doubt, risk, or fear. I call this "Everyday Courage." It's the most powerful in the small moments that won't make headlines, but still shape your organization's culture, your team's trust, and your legacy. Drawing on research and my work with senior leaders, I've created a plate look with six types of everyday courage. Moral. Choosing principles over profit. Build it by clarifying their values early and committing to them before a crisis puts them So, speeding up when others stay silent. Build it in meetings where silence feels safer. By naming the risk, voicing your perspective clearly, and rewarding dissent on your team. Emotion. Staying present with hard feelings, your own and your team's. Build it during challenges by naming your emotions and leading with honesty, instead of brushing past the shelter. Intellectual. Questioning your own assumptions. Build it by regularly inviting others to challenge your thinking, and celebrate your proven wrong. Create, putting bold and tested ideas on the table. Build it by lowering the stakes, running smaller servants, and normalizing smart failures along the way. Physical, showing up in tough or risky conditions. Build it by practicing presence, studying real time with front-line teams. These aren't dramatic and live-rapping ads. They're everyday choices.
