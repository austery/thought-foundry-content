STEVE:
Do Ontario's former premiers
still stand by the policies
they became known for?
The Premier Files
 explores
all of that and much more.
I, Kathleen O'Day Wynne,
swear that I will
duly and faithfully
and to the best
of my skill
and knowledge
execute the powers
and trusts reposed
in me as Premier
and President
of the Council
and as Minister of Agriculture
of the province of Ontario,
so help me God.
If you walk along this
second-floor corridor
here at Queen's Park,
you will pass by the
portraits of 24 white men,
all of whom have been Premier of
Ontario since Confederation.
And then, there's this painting,
which is a little bit different.
Kathleen Wynne
became Ontario's 25th
and first-ever
female Premier in 2013.
We spoke to her
at Victoria College
at the University of Toronto
about the challenges of being
a pioneer in public life.
Premier Wynne, great to see you.
Thank you for doing this.
Thank you, Steve.
Pleasure.
I'm going to play Ralph Edwards
here and do a bit of
This is Your Life
 here
for the next little while.
So, let's start
at the beginning.
You're born
in Richmond Hill.
What was your childhood like?
So, born in Richmond Hill, 1953.
Richmond Hill at that time
was very different
than Richmond Hill now.
It was quite a separate town.
It was sort of self-contained
north of Richmond Hill.
It wasn't a-- it wasn't
a commuter town at that point.
People lived and worked in
Richmond Hill for the most part.
My dad was
a general practitioner,
family doc in Richmond Hill.
I was the eldest
of four girls.
I always feel like
it was a very ordinary
childhood, you know,
in terms of middle-class
Ontario, mid-50s, post-war.
It was-- we were part
of a growth community,
you know.
So, it was that kind of town.
There was lots of optimism.
My parents were
involved in the community.
Mom was kind of
a radical suburban woman.
She didn't want to be the
doctor's wife, you know.
She was involved
in the social planning council,
and she and a group of people
started a youth aid centre
because it was the 60s,
and there were drugs,
and there was turmoil, you know.
It was the sexual revolution,
and my parents--
I was a member
of the United Church.
I grew up in the United Church.
I kind of enjoyed
the structure of it.
You know, in high school,
I was on all the teams
because there were only 500 kids
in the school,
so-- in Richmond Hill
High School, so...
STEVE:
But you were athletic.
I was athletic enough
to be on all the teams
that I wanted to be on.
And so, you know,
those were really--
those were really important,
happy years for me.
The school-- school
was a happy place for me.
I can remember
my nursery school.
So, I think-- I think the fact
that I had two little siblings
and then three little siblings
made school a happy place
away from that chaos.
(Chuckling)
So...
Is it stretching
it too far to say
that a future
Minister of Education,
a future Premier,
would have been influenced
by her personal relationships,
connection to the public school
system back in the 50s?
KATHLEEN:
I think--
I think it's not
a stretch at all.
My grandmother
had been a teacher.
My uncle was
a professor at U of T.
Education was valued
highly in our family.
But I think it was
my grandmother,
Eva Crummer,
she taught in the north.
She left Watford when
she was seventeen to teach.
She went to normal school
for six months
or whatever they had to do,
and then she started
teaching in the early 1900s.
And, um...
And she was her own person.
She'd been orphaned
when she was a baby.
And so, she really seized life,
and education was
everything to her.
She told stories about teaching
the Italian immigrants
in Sault Ste. Marie,
the parents of
the kids in her class.
She started doing
ESL classes after school
because the parents
didn't speak English, you know?
So, I guess one of the themes
running through my family was,
if there's a problem
that needs to be solved,
you know, you should
figure out a way to solve it.
I'm always interested
in successful politicians
who run
for the first time and lose.
And you were one of those kinds
of politicians, right?
You ran for school board trustee
in Toronto and lost in 1994.
And then, you ran again
to win a nomination
for the provincial Liberal Party
in-- was that 1999?
'99.
And lost.
Lost again.
Why didn't you give up
after going 0 for 2?
Well, first of all,
I highly recommend losing first,
rather than losing after
'cause winning is great,
but if you've lost,
you know you're going to live.
You know? You know you've got--
you know there's life after.
Why didn't I quit?
Because I loved
the exercise.
I loved knocking
on people's doors
and being able to
skip the small talk
and just having a conversation
about something important.
In that case,
it was their kids' education.
You know,
I just thought that was amazing.
And so, it actually--
losing actually
gave me kind of a glimpse
of what it would be like
to be involved in that work
on a day-to-day basis,
and it actually
kind of firmed
my resolve to do it.
And then, the next test was
a nomination race
going on in Don Valley West,
where I ended up eventually.
But there was some,
you know, talk about,
"Well, why don't you go
and run in Don Valley West?
"You can do that.
"You know, we'll hold the
nomination for you.
"We'll wait till you've
had time to sell memberships."
And I was kind of
going over this in my mind,
whether I wanted to do it
because I already knew
Paul Davidson was working
in Don Valley West
to be the candidate.
And just a couple
of days before I was--
you know, I had set a deadline
when I was going
to make the decision,
one of his friends and
supporters came to my house
and said to me,
"Kathleen, please don't do this.
"It's the wrong thing to do."
"Don't challenge Paul."
"Don't challenge Paul.
"Don't go in and, you know--
just it will
not be a good thing.
"People will be angry."
And I didn't,
she convinced me not to do it.
And then,
I went and worked for Paul.
Jane and I worked very hard
for Paul in that '99 election.
And because of that,
it's just...
All the things you do
that are the right things,
as I've learned in politics,
come back at you.
It's kind of like life, right?
They come back to at you.
So, we became good friends.
We'd worked in that campaign.
He didn't win
that campaign in '99.
And then, when it came time
for him to make the decision
to run in 2003, he'd already
decided he was moving.
He was going to Ottawa.
He was taking another job.
And he came to me and he said,
"Well, I'm not--
"I'm not gonna run,
"and Andrew Bevan will work for
you if you'll be the candidate."
So, that's how
I connected with Andrew Bevan.
So, I won that
nomination in 2002,
and we started working.
If you remember,
Ernie Eves was--
well, of course, you remember,
Ernie Eves was the Premier
and we--
there was on again, off again
when the election
was gonna be called.
We waited and waited, and
we had brownouts and blackouts,
and it was a mess,
the run-up to that election.
Um...
And it was SARS too, right?
There was a lot going on.
And a case of mad cow disease.
And mad cow disease, yeah.
It was really a mess.
But what it did was it gave me
a lot of time to get ready.
I went around that riding.
My team and I
knocked on 40,000 doors
in that--
in that run-up to the campaign.
So, I won the nomination,
worked that whole--
you know, the rest
of that year and into 2003,
and then we went in 2003.
STEVE:
Maybe an odd question,
but how well did you know
the leader of your party
at that time, Dalton McGuinty?
KATHLEEN:
Not at all. I really didn't
know Dalton at all
because I had worked
as an activist
and as a trustee,
I'd worked with some
of the Toronto members.
You know, I'd worked with
people like Rosario Marchese
and Gerard Kennedy, Mike Cole
because we were involved
in the anti-Harris
education movement,
and the Citizens
for Local Democracy
that was opposing the
amalgamation of the city.
So, it was those
Toronto members who I knew.
I didn't really
know Dalton at all,
and he didn't know me,
to be fair.
He was Ottawa.
He was in Ottawa.
We just had no history.
So, that was-- that was how we
entered government together.
Well, you win your seat,
and three years later,
you end up in the cabinet.
But those three years that I was
in the backbench are important
because I didn't know
the system at Queen's Park.
I'd been at the municipal
level in the school board.
I knew the
school board really well.
But I didn't know
the system at Queen's Park.
I didn't know it--
I mean, I knew it from afar.
But it was really important for
me to serve on committees,
to travel with committees,
to watch people like Shelley
Martel work with delegates
and ask intelligent
questions and get information.
STEVE:
She was a New Democrat.
KATHLEEN:
She was a New Democrat.
STEVE:
But a role model for you?
KATHLEEN:
But she was a role model for me
as we travelled the
province on those committees
because she really--
she always did her homework,
she always had
great questions,
and I always felt she got the
best out of those exchanges
in whatever town we were in,
talking about
electricity, or pharmacy,
whatever we were
talking about, pharmacare.
So, that was-- those three years
were very, very important to me,
and I got to talk about
all sorts of things
in the legislature.
I'm-- (Unclear) a lot
in those first three years
because I loved
that part of the job.
I loved, you know,
having my staff do research,
and then we put
together a speech,
and I'd be able to go in
and be part of the debate.
So, those three years were not--
it wasn't just like, for me,
a leap to cabinet.
How did you get the call
that you were about to become
Minister of Education in 2006?
Well, that's a funny story.
So, we were about to go to,
I want to say Brighton
or somewhere east,
eastern Ontario,
to a caucus retreat. So,
I was going to go the next day,
and I had been trying to
get a meeting with the boss,
with the Premier,
to talk about an issue
I was really worried about.
I got a call that said,
on the Sunday night,
that I could get this--
I could get this
meeting the next day--
or I can't remember
exactly the day,
but I would have the meeting
late in the day,
and I said, "Yeah, but I'm
going to the caucus retreat,
"so I'll talk to him," whatever.
And they said,
"No, you can't do that.
"You have to stay
and go to this meeting."
So, I walked into this
meeting with Dalton,
I still didn't know
what was happening,
and he said, "Well, Kathleen--"
because what had happened
was Joe...
Cordiano.
...Cordiano had moved on,
and Sandra--
That's a nice way of saying
he got fired and quit.
He got fired and quit.
And Sandra
was being moved
into economic
development,
and so, I was being
put into education.
It was a complete shock.
I had absolutely no idea
that was going to happen.
I think I burst into tears.
You know,
I was very excited about it.
How much latitude
did he give you
to run the
Ministry of Education?
Well, um, a lot.
You know, I mean, if I think
about the implementation
of full-day kindergarten,
I had-- I had a lot of--
I had a lot of input into
that and shepherded it
and brought it along
and made it happen, really,
with Charles Pascal
and Michael Fullan.
I mean, we were
deciding on the model,
and Dalton took our-- he took
the advice from me and us
when we were doing negotiations.
I can remember
sitting in a caucus meeting
and sending
him a note saying, "Okay,
"I know that the elementary
teachers don't want to settle,
"but here's what
I think we need to do,"
and he said, "Fine."
You know, so...
So, um...
I felt that
I had a lot of authority
over the work that we did.
Now, education
was a special case,
in that he saw himself
as the education minister.
You know,
it was really important to him.
He called himself
the 'Education Premier'.
He did.
And not 'Minister', 'Premier'.
Yes, he called himself
the 'Education Premier',
and other people called him
the 'Education Premier',
and it was very
important to him.
So, there were times
when we didn't agree.
For example, I was not as--
I was not as convinced
that our focus on test scores
and improving test scores was--
was as important
as he thought it was. You know?
So, we had a little bit
of back and forth
about that a few times.
2007, you seek re-election.
Right.
And I want to know
what you thought
when you found out that
the leader of the PC party,
John Tory, intended to run
in Don Valley West
against you.
Well, my heart sank a bit
because I had just been made
Minister of Education in 2006,
and it was shortly after that
appointment that I learned
that John Tory was going
to come and run against me.
I think I was mad, I was mad.
It felt like,
"Why are you doing this?"
You know? "Why don't you
stay in Dufferin-Caledon
"where you, for sure,
are going to win?
"Why are we going to go
through this exercise?"
I...
That was the one election
that I really did think we
weren't going to win, you know,
that I wasn't going to win.
You thought he'd beat you.
I thought he'd beat me,
and lots of other people
thought he would beat me.
You know, I had members
of the caucus say to me,
"You know, you
could look at another riding,
"you should look
somewhere else."
I said, "No,
I'm not going to do that."
But, you know,
the leader of
the opposition usually wins.
Did you tell him
you were upset with him
for running against you?
No.
You never said it?
No.
Okay.
You mean did I
tell him after the fact?
No, no, no, at the time.
No. Oh, no.
No, no. No.
After your time
as Education Minister,
what did you feel was better
about our education system?
Well, there was way more staff,
and the class sizes,
across the board, had gone down.
We were
in control of that issue.
There were supports
for students who needed them.
So, we had specifically put in
place teachers in grade 9 and 10
to help with credit recovery.
So, students who were
falling between the cracks,
we were trying to catch them
before they got
into the upper grades.
There were more possibilities
for specialization.
We put in a thing called
a specialist high skills major,
so kids could
bundle together courses
and graduate with an agriculture
specialist high skills major,
for example, you know,
which was an interesting way
of combining real-life
experience and academic.
We had early-- we had full-day
kindergarten in the province,
which was a major change,
particularly for kids
who didn't come to school
necessarily
ready for school, you know.
So, it made a huge
difference to them
and it made a huge
difference to their parents
because there was a--
there was a--
there was
a childcare aspect to it,
although that's not
what it was about.
It was about giving kids
a good head-start.
So, I felt good about that.
I felt that we had
a better relationship
with the unions
and the federations,
which was important to me.
Now, with one exception,
the elementary teachers
were kind of mad at me
because of the
2008 negotiation.
But overall, I felt that
our working relationship
with all the
education partners was better.
We had a partnership table
that brought together
heads of unions,
heads of school boards,
people like Annie Kidder,
parent activists.
We brought them together when
we were bringing in legislation,
and we had a way of
kind of collaborating
on curriculum
and on legislation.
I felt that we had done a lot of
work around parent involvement
that gave parents
more of a role in the systems.
Indigenous education
and the importance of,
not just the--
not just the support of
Indigenous kids in the system,
but the importance of all kids
learning a different version of
our history that's more honest,
that was really important.
It was work that I started when
I was Minister of Education
and then completed when-- or
carried on when I was Premier.
What did I not get done?
(Sighing)
I still feel that
we are missing the boat
in terms of the physical,
arts, sort of--
not extracurricular, but the
non-academic in our schools.
I think we have allowed
the academic of, you know,
science and technology
and language and math--
those are all really
important things.
But the first time
I took part in education
activism was in 1987,
and I was walking
the picket line
with elementary
teachers in Toronto.
So, this was
before the amalgamation,
before any of that,
and what they were striking
about was having more prep time.
But prep time meant
having more art teachers,
more phys ed teachers,
more music teachers
in the schools,
and I think that we do not do
enough of that in our system.
I did put in place grants
for outdoor education
and local priorities,
like phys ed programs and so on,
but it wasn't enough
to make it as systematic,
systemic
as it should have been.
So, I think we're
making a big mistake in not
giving kids a richer
kind of experience.
After education,
Premier McGuinty shuffled you
to a few other portfolios.
You had transportation, you had
municipal affairs and housing,
you had Aboriginal affairs.
Do you think, in hindsight,
you were able to bring
the same kind of emotional,
passionate involvement
to those portfolios
that you did to education,
which clearly is...
Yeah.
...I think, your first love?
Absolutely.
I have to say
I surprised myself.
I actually did get passionate
about those other things.
I just didn't know
about them at first, you know.
So, I had to learn about them.
But what those first three years
in government had shown me
was how important
all of the things were
and how
interconnected all of them are.
At what point
did it occur to you
that Premier McGuinty
might not be the Premier forever
and that you might want
to think about replacing him?
I think when we won
the minority in '11.
But honestly, at that point,
I was not thinking about running
for the leadership.
That was not something that--
it was not something that I had,
you know, thought was in--
would have thought
was in my scope at that point.
I didn't think
I was ready for it.
So, right at that time,
I didn't think about it.
It wasn't until a bit later
that I started thinking
about it, into that year.
Was it after he announced
he was stepping down?
No, it was before that.
It was before that.
It was before that.
When you got called
to that sort of special
late afternoon
caucus meeting that day,
did you know
the Premier was going to
step down at that meeting?
So, at that point, it was like,
"Okay, this is weird." It was
six o'clock at night, I think.
Yeah.
Right? It was very weird.
And when I absolutely knew
was when we saw Terri McGuinty
come into the room.
STEVE:
But not before?
KATHLEEN:
No, no. I mean, people were--
people were...
STEVE:
Speculating, for sure.
...speculating on
what was going to happen.
But it was when Terri
walked in there was,
"Okay, there's no way
it's anything else."
STEVE:
You don't bring the wife
to Queens Park unless...
Right, the family-- because
this is a family decision.
He was such
a family guy, you know,
it would have been
a decision they made together.
Was there a particular person--
since you've told us you
weren't really thinking about
running for leader
well before that,
was there somebody
who said something to you
that made you realize, "I should
be in the conversation,
"I need to think about this"?
(Exhaling sharply)
I think um...
I think Andrew Bevan, probably,
because Sheila Ward had been
talking--
but Sheila, bless her heart,
she talked
about me being premier
when I was a school trustee.
It was like,
"Okay, Sheila, settle down."
Settle down.
"This is not happening."
And I just thought
that was her fantasy
and her living
vicariously, whatever.
But I think when Andrew
seriously said, you know--
he said, "Of course
you're thinking about it,"
in his Northern English way.
Then, I kind of
seriously had to say,
"Okay, does this--
does this make sense?"
And then, Linda Jeffrey,
she was one of my early
supporters, and she said---
Brampton MPP.
Brampton MPP.
"You're gonna run, right?"
And that made me--
that gave me pause, as well.
Let's talk about how you put
your bid together because--
and I'm gonna do
a bit of a lead-up here.
You are unique in the history
of the province of Ontario
in as much as you
not only had to raise money
to run a candidacy,
and develop policy,
and line up supporters
and all of that,
but you also had to figure out
how you were going
to deal with the issue
that no one else has ever had
to deal with. Number one,
being a woman. We'd never had
a woman premier before.
Number two, openly gay.
We'd never had an
openly gay premier before.
I want to put
something on the table.
Is Ontario ready
for a gay premier?
You've heard that question.
(Audience cheering)
You've all--
you've all heard that question,
but let's say
what it actually means.
Can a gay woman win?
That's what it actually means.
(Audience cheering)
As you sat down
with your people
to figure out how you
wanted to handle all that,
let us in on those
conversations.
Well, I think the really
salient conversation was about
how open I was going to be
about that throughout my--
throughout my campaign,
my leadership campaign.
And because I'd made a decision
when I first went into
public office in 1994,
when I ran
as a school trustee,
it was-- it was clear that
it was going to be part of
who I presented
to the province, right?
So, I think, right down to what
was going to be in my speech,
the leadership speech,
which laid it on the table
and said to people, "This is--
you know, "This is who I am,"
we talked about that.
I mean, I had members of my
riding association come to me
and say,
"Kathleen, please don't run
"because you cannot
be the premier,
"you cannot be elected
because you're a lesbian,
"and please don't run."
And, you know,
that kind of conversation
only firmed my resolve that it
was important for me to run
because that's how
homophobia works, right?
Important for you to run,
but not necessarily,
if I can use this expression,
put it in the window.
You could have run
without ever referencing it.
Right.
...but you didn't do that.
No, I didn't.
Well, there was
no point in that.
There was no point because
I had been open all along.
I mean, one of the--
one of the committees
that kind of
vaulted me into thinking
that I could run
for school trustee
was called 'education
against homophobia'.
You know, I had been--
I had been leading
a parents group to improve
the equity education
on LGBTQ issues at the
Toronto Board of Education.
So, there was
no point in me pretending
that that wasn't
going to be part of--
part of my presentation
to the province.
We are the
Ontario Liberal Party,
the best party,
in the best province,
in the best country
in the world. Thank you!
(Audience cheering)
So, you gave the speech
on Convention Day
at Maple Leaf Gardens.
How do you think it went?
I think it was wonderful.
I mean, for me,
it was a wonderful experience.
I loved doing it.
I felt in my skin.
I loved the feeling
in the room.
Well, I was going to say,
you were not the frontrunner
going into that convention.
No.
Sandra Pupitello
was the frontrunner.
Exactly.
Do you think that speech
moved votes
and helped you win?
I know it did.
I've had people tell me
they switched their vote.
They came in
as Pupitello delegates
or they came in--
you know, whatever.
I think the difference--
and I don't know.
And I'd have to--
I haven't actually had this
conversation with Sandra.
But I think that,
because I took
a less pugilistic tone,
I think because I said,
"I'm gonna talk to Tim Hudak,
"I'm gonna talk
to Andrea Horwath,
"you know, we gotta
work together,"
and I didn't say, "I'm gonna try
to beat them down," you know,
and then, in fact,
we extended the life
of the government
for a year because of that,
and I-- you know,
I met with Andrea,
so, I think that tone was
what the party
was looking for.
Because remember, we figured
we were going to lose the next
election we went into, right?
It was 2013 or 2012.
2013, by the time
we had the convention,
we didn't think
we were going to be able
to get up off the mat,
which is probably why the party
was willing to try a woman.
You know, that's the story.
But I think they
were looking for somebody
who was bringing
something a little different
in terms of tone.
And so, that was--
I think that was part
of what convinced
people to support me.
So, what was the
thinking on your part then?
"I'm going to run for leader,
I'm going to win,
"I'll be premier for
however long this term lasts,
"then I'll end up on the
opposition benches,
"and maybe, if I'm lucky,
somewhere down the road,
"I'll get back in"?
So--
Because that
doesn't sound...
You know, you're--
you give me--
I think you give
all of us way more credit
for a long-term plan...
(Chuckling)
...than we deserve.
You know, I saw work in front
of me that needed to be done.
I felt that
the work we were doing
as a government was important.
I didn't want
to see that undermined.
I didn't think that the
opposition had a plan
that was going to was
going to help the people
who I knew needed
help in the province.
I felt that we had,
of course, made mistakes.
There were bridges
I wanted to rebuild.
You know, we had gotten on the
outs with the education workers.
I wanted to
rebuild that bridge.
So, I saw that work ahead of me,
and I didn't know whether we
could win an election or not,
but I thought
it was worth a shot.
This is just the most
clichéd question in the book,
but I have to ask it anyway.
How meaningful
was it to you, at the time,
to be sworn in as
the first-ever female premier
in the province of Ontario?
You don't go into things
to be a role model,
but once you're there,
I think it's important to
recognize who's watching.
I'm just trying to imagine
what it was like, though,
when you walked
down the hallway
of the second floor
of the legislature
and you passed all of those
portraits of all of those...
older white men,
knowing that,
someday,
there would be a portrait
of a woman up there
and it would be you.
Do you remember that moment?
I do.
Well, you know, what I remember
is, moment after moment,
when I was elected in 2003,
walking down those halls
over and over again
and looking at the pictures,
not just of the premiers,
but of the parliaments,
all these guys with
their big long beards,
and you know, looking
at the dates and realizing
that was when my grandmother
was a kid, you know,
and realizing what
a male bastion it was.
So, yes, the reason
I moved very quickly
after we lost
the election in 2018
to get my portrait on the wall
quickly was just that,
because I wanted the kids
who came into the legislature
to see a woman on the wall
and to realize that it was
possible for them to be there.
Okay. One of the first things
that you felt you needed to do
after you became Premier was,
apparently, apologize
for all of the screw-ups
related to the gas plants,
and you did a bit of a circuit.
I remember you came on

The Agenda,
 and you said,
"I apologize," I think,
11 times in that interview,
about the fact that--
And I must have done at least
11 events where I apologized.
I want to address the issue
particularly of the
relocation of the gas plants.
The decisions around the
relocation of the gas plants
that were made were wrong.
I've apologized,
I've taken responsibility
for those decisions,
but they were wrong, Suresh.
And there was public money
that was wasted in those--
in those decisions, and
that shouldn't have happened.
You didn't make that decision
to cancel the gas plant,
and I wonder if,
at any point,
during all of that,
you thought to yourself,
"Geez, is this what
it's going to be like?
"I'm gonna be spending the next
however long I'm Premier
"cleaning up the messes
of the previous guy?"
Um...
So, I was part of the government
that made that decision, right?
My name was
on the order, um, with his.
I...
My hunch is you weren't
the decider, though.
I was not the decider.
No, no. The timing of
that decision was dreadful.
It was in
the middle of the election.
It was just a disaster.
It should have been--
the decision should have been
made months before that.
Was I resentful of that? No.
I mean, I knew that I was going
into a challenging situation,
a government that was
already long in the tooth.
I knew that I was
going to be carrying
the accomplishments
and the mistakes
of that government.
But for me, Steve,
the accomplishments
outweighed the mistakes.
And I was willing to--
I was willing to
kind of own up to,
come clean on,
talk about, you know, the things
that people had really disliked
about our government.
I was proud
of the work that we'd done.
We'd made a mistake
around the gas plants.
And there were things
I was going to do
to rectify other things.
One of the biggest ideas
you brought forward
during your time as Premier
was the notion of selling
a chunk of Hydro One,
the publicly owned-- you're
closing your eyes already
and nodding your head 'cause you
just love talking about this.
You think I've had to
talk about gas plants a lot?
Let me tell you how many times
I've had
to talk about Hydro One.
Well, I mean...
let's refresh people's memories.
The idea was to sell a chunk
of this publicly owned
electricity distribution company
and take those billions
realized from the sale
and spend it on public transit.
Right.
And have some cash to
leverage building transit, yes.
(Stammering)
Why?
Well, no, I get it.
I get that
that was the idea, but it--
I mean, somewhere along the way,
it clearly went off the rails,
and it became
sort of Exhibit A
of terrible idea to do.
What happened?
So, here's the way--
here's the way I've
talked about this many times.
(Both chuckling)
We were in a situation
where I had made a commitment
that we were going
to build transit.
We were in a situation,
if you remember,
we were still building our--
sort of climbing out
of the economic downturn.
We had a deficit, I think,
of about $10 billion,
which now doesn't seem like
a big deal, but it was then.
And so,
we were running out of room.
The finance
officials were saying,
"You can't keep borrowing.
"You know, you're
going to get a downgrade
"from the
bond rating agencies.
"You've got to do something to--
"you need some liquidity here."
So, I brought in some
financial advisors,
Ed Clark led that team,
and we talked about--
we talked about the LCBO,
we talked about OLG, so the
Lottery Gaming Commission,
and we talked about Hydro One.
Basically, what are the assets
that we own as a province
that we could leverage
to build new assets, right?
Distribution of
electricity was already
at least
partly privatized.
Hydro One only delivered
about 25% of the electricity
to about 25% of Ontarians, and
so I thought, "Okay, we can--
"you know, we can find a way
to communicate this."
The other interesting thing was
Hydro One was not
a very popular company
when we went into
this whole exercise.
It became the
darling of everyone
as we went through
the process. But, um...
So, I was convinced
that this was a good idea
in terms of policy.
I wasn't convinced that
it was a good political idea,
and it is the thing that
kept me awake at night
for weeks and weeks,
as we made the decision
because I knew
it ran against my brand.
You know, I knew that people saw
me as a left-of-centre Liberal,
that, you know,
the public sector
was near and dear
to my heart, which it is,
and so people would look
askance at me selling off--
partially
selling off this asset.
It's a bit of
a Tory thing to do, isn't it?
It was a bit of
a Tory thing to do.
But I will say, I don't think
it was the wrong policy.
I am pragmatic.
I'm a Liberal because
I am not ideological,
you know, and
I actually do believe that,
where there's an idea that
makes sense, we should do it,
if we can protect the people
who need to be protected.
I was very keen on there
being the possibility
that the head of Hydro One
could be removed by government,
which Doug Ford did
right after he was elected.
I was very keen on there
being commitments around,
you know, delivery to rural
and remote northern customers.
So, there were
those kinds of things
that were built into the sale.
But it was a terrible
political idea.
You know, it was
a terrible political idea,
and it came at a time
when electricity prices
were going up.
So, the opposition,
particularly the NDP,
could conflate the notion
of selling off
part of Hydro One
and increased
electricity prices,
even though the electricity
prices were not going up
because of the
partial sale of Hydro One.
They were going up because we
had made billions of dollars
of investment in
electricity infrastructure.
But the two things
happened at the same time,
and so, politically,
it was, um--
it was a disaster for us.
What were your expectations
going into the 2014 election,
which would have been
your first as leader?
That we had a shot, but
that it was a long shot to win.
I...
You know,
there were a couple of times
in my political career--
I always had a plan B,
but in 2007, when John Tory
ran against me, and in 2014,
Jean and
I did have a plan B.
You know? That--
Which was what?
Well, we-- in 2007,
our thought was maybe
we'll go for six months
and live in Ireland, you know,
like, do a break from Ontario.
That was probably something like
what we would have done in 2014,
definitely get away,
because I knew how
hard it was going to be to lose.
So, that was-- that was
my expectation in 2014.
When did you know
you had a shot to win?
More than just a shot,
actually, that you had
a good feeling about winning?
So, there are a couple of
moments in that campaign
that I remember
clearly, and one of them--
because a lot of it
gets to be a blur.
But we went to Walkerton,
and we talked
about regulations
because the Tories were
talking about
reducing regulation and
red tape and that kind of stuff.
And I remember standing in
Walkerton and talking about
what happens when you don't have
protections in place,
and you know, referencing the
people who had gotten so sick
in the Walkerton--
in the water crisis. So...
Thousands.
Thousands, yeah.
Thousands of people.
And I remember thinking,
"This is a message that is
going to resonate," and it did.
But it was when-- you know,
Tim Hudak made a mistake
on the calculation
of the numbers of jobs.
First of all,
he announced he was going to cut
a number of jobs,
and he was talking about how
many he was going to create,
and he got the numbers muddled,
and I could see our guys were
going to make hay of that,
and it undermined his campaign.
So, when I listen to the pundits
now talk about that campaign,
it's like that's all it was.
It was that Tim Hudak
and his campaign
weren't able to
keep the numbers straight
and make their argument,
that that's what made
it possible for us to win.
I like to think
there was a little bit
of the positive on our side,
but I know that the
Tory campaign faltered,
and it was those moments
where I felt it personally.
When Tim Hudak announced,
I think in Barrie,
that he wanted to eliminate
100,000 positions,
not fire 100,000 people,
but eliminate 100,000 positions
in the public sector,
broader public sector,
did you immediately understand
that that was something
you could seize upon?
Absolutely. I mean, it's easy
to make the argument that,
if you take 100,000 positions
out of a government
that actually
functions pretty well,
something's gonna
fall through the cracks.
And that's-- that's when--
that's when we were able to
make the argument that,
you know,
if you remove these protections,
you remove this work,
then bad things are
going to start to happen.
And it wasn't just about--
to your point,
it wasn't just about
people losing their jobs.
It was about the work of
government, the work of safety,
the work of community
protection, not being done.
Did you know, election night,
you were gonna win?
We did this!
(Audience cheering)
Thank you!
My team, I think, did.
I think, you know, I was
less convinced of that.
Certainly not convinced
we were gonna get a majority.
You know, that was-- and we
didn't have a huge majority.
I think it was like
four or five seats in the end.
So, I was definitely hopeful
that we'd be able
to eke out a win.
But would we get to a majority
that was actually comfortable
enough for us to govern?
I didn't--
I didn't know that for sure.
And when you
saw that you did...
That was pretty exciting.
It was--
it was very, very cool.
I, um...
Yeah, it was one of those--
it was one of those moments
where you'd sort of
pinch yourself
and think, "Okay,
did this really happen?"
And we'd worked so hard,
and the team was so happy.
And it felt-- it felt like
a huge validation, Steve,
of the work that we had done.
Okay, so, you inherited a
minority, you got a majority.
That doesn't happen
all that often,
so it's a pretty
good vote of confidence.
How much of a honeymoon
do you think you got
after that majority?
(Chuckling)
A couple of days.
It seemed kind
of short, didn't it?
Not very much, yeah.
Why do you think?
Well, because we weren't
a new government, you know,
and we were-- we were in the
traces, we were on the job,
and I had said we were
going to come right back,
and, you know, we got right--
we got right to work,
and it was stuff that we had
promised we were going to do.
Your numbers started to decline,
like, fairly precipitously,
I think,
after a couple of years.
A couple of years.
It was around 2016, yeah.
Yeah.
Do you know what did that?
I don't know whether
I had just not been able
to keep it new enough
or to do enough...
brand new things
that made people feel
that we were--
you know, that we were on--
that we were on a good track.
Because the first couple of
years, the economy was good.
I mean, the economy
was getting better.
The economy was
actually pretty good
at the end of our term in 2018.
I haven't seen polling on this,
but I do remember, anecdotally,
hearing people
at the time saying,
"She seems very preachy now."
Yeah.
Were you picking that up?
Well, yeah, I think--
that's what I mean,
but I think people--
or maybe I was, maybe I was.
There's a lot of being a woman
connected to all of that,
and I've never used
the excuse that I was a woman
for why we lost.
But I do think
that there's
a different standard
that women have to
live up to or abide by
than men do.
And people think of women
in leadership differently.
So,
there's no doubt that,
yeah, people got tired of me;
people didn't
like the way I sounded,
maybe they didn't like
the way I looked, whatever.
I grated on them,
and that's a painful thing
for me to have to say,
but I think
that's the reality.
They said,
back in the day, that,
when Leslie Frost really wanted
to know what the people thought,
he'd go for a haircut
and his barber would tell him,
give him the
unvarnished truth.
Did you have somebody
like that in your life
who was sort of not
very plugged into politics,
but plugged in enough to
give you the straight goods
on what people were thinking?
I probably didn't have
enough people like that,
but I had people around me who--
you know, who listened to
right-wing radio, for example,
and would say, "Okay, things
are not going well." You know?
But you were never
going to get them necessarily.
Well, no, but there were--
the tone started
to shift around 2016, you know?
And I remember having a--
having a dinner with
members of my team,
and, you know, them kind of
laying out for me what
was happening in the numbers.
I mean, we had
very honest conversations
about what was happening,
and I go back often
to those nights and thinking,
"Should I then have said,
I'm going to step down?"
You know, it's 2016,
but I don't--
I'd been there since 2013.
I was in the middle of
my first term, you know?
It's not-- it's just that
I was in the extended term
of a government that
had already been in office
for three terms, you know?
So-- so, it was a really
challenging situation.
I don't even know
I can honestly say that,
if I went back,
I would leave,
but it certainly
would be more of a question,
knowing what I know now.
But I don't think
we would have won anyway,
you know, if there'd
been another leader,
and that was my thought.
So, if I leave-- and this
was starting 2016-2017,
if I leave and we go
into the tank anyway,
then you got a new leader
who's got to deal with this.
At least if I lose,
I've had this time,
and we'll rebuild.
I didn't know we were going
to go down to seven seats.
If I'd known that,
then I probably would have said,
"Well, I've got to go.
Because if I'm the person who's
going to take us to seven seats,
then, you know, I think we need
to try something else.
Okay, that's interesting
because I wondered at the time
whether or not there
were any discussions
happening among your
inner circle about whether--
even though you were
only in your first term,
whether you wanted to
give it a second shot
or whether you thought
about stepping down.
Yeah, we did.
You did think about it.
And what the numbers
were telling us was
that I had the
best chance of winning
and I had the
best chance of losing badly.
So, they ran a bunch of
people's names or whatever.
And so-- so,
I made the decision to stay.
Sadly, we went on the loss--
you know, the bad loss
side of the ledger. So...
And don't think I don't carry
that around with me every day.
You know?
Still?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
Because we haven't recovered
as a party yet, you know?
And I feel like,
if we hadn't gone to seven
seats, we would potentially be
the official opposition
at least right now.
And, um...
Yeah, I feel like
I had a hand in that.
It wasn't me alone,
but I had
a hand in that, for sure.
As much as you love
talking about Hydro One,
let me remind you of
another decision you made
in the 2018
election campaign,
and I'm sure you know
where I'm going here.
With a few days
left to go in the campaign,
you had a very unusual press
conference, I think,
in Michael Coteau's riding.
What's that?
Don Valley East.
In a playground,
Don Valley East.
In a playground...
Playground, yeah.
...in which you said, "Look,
"I know I'm not gonna win
"and send as many liberals as
you can back to Queens Park
"because we got to keep
the new government honest."
And there was a great...
stir in the land
about whether a sitting Premier
should ever acknowledge,
with however many days
it was still to go...
A week.
...a week to go, that
I have no chance of winning.
Yeah.
What went into that decision?
So, it's interesting.
About two weeks
into the campaign,
I got a call
from somebody who said,
"Kathleen,
you've got to--
"you've got to, um, step down."
Okay? Because this person--
In the middle of
the election campaign?
Do what I did
a week ahead, do it then.
And I said,
"I'm not doing that."
And I hadn't wrapped--
at that point,
I hadn't wrapped my mind around
us losing that badly, right?
And I said to-- I remember
I said to Andrew Bevan,
I said, "So, this is what this
guy's called and said to me,"
"because he was working on one
of the campaigns and he said,
"'You know, we're going to the
door and people are saying,
"'"We love your
candidate, we love him,
"'"but we can't
stand your leader,"'
"and that's why he said,
you've got to step down."
So, I said to Andrew,
"This is what he has said to me.
"What do you think?"
And he said-- he said,
"Well, no,
you're not doing that."
And then, he said, "Not yet."
Ooh.
So, that was my--
you know, that was my,
"Okay,
we are in deep trouble,
"and this is not going to--
"we're not going to
pull this out of the bag."
So, then,
it was another couple of weeks
before we actually
got to the point.
Hang on. When he said "Not yet,"
did you say to him,
"What the hell
do you mean 'not yet'?"
No, because it was-- Andrew and
I have this funny relationship,
where there's a kind of a
mind-reading that goes on,
and I-- and I thought,
"Okay, you don't need to say
any more than that."
You knew what it meant.
"I know what this means.
"We're not gonna--
I'm not gonna sob yet.
"You know, I got work to do,
"so I'm just gonna
carry on and do my work,
"and then you'll
tell me what comes next."
And I guess, in my mind,
part of me was thinking,
"Well, maybe the numbers
will get better."
And I don't think I realized
at the time, Steve,
that there really--
there were lots of candidates
who didn't want me
in their riding. You know?
I don't think-- I mean, my team
shielded me from that a bit.
It was just very tough.
I knew that, um...
I had to, basically,
cut my candidates loose.
You know, I had to--
I had to give them the ability
to go to the door and say,
"You know, she's not
going to be the Premier,
"so you can vote for me and..."
'Cause we were
staring down zero seats.
Honestly?
Honestly.
At that moment, had the
election happened that day...
They were worried
we'd get no seats.
...you would have had nothing.
Yeah, yeah.
We were worried.
This is not a concession speech.
I conceded I would
not be Premier days ago.
STEVE:
Your team felt awful
about letting you down.
Awful.
They were so apologetic.
They apologized to me,
I was apologizing to them.
You know? It was--
it was just an awful--
it was just
an awful juncture, you know?
You feel like
you've let people down.
I felt like I'd let
all those candidates
across the province down.
I mean, it was--
it was brutal, it was brutal.
STEVE:
So, election night,
you have to sit there and
watch the returns come in.
KATHLEEN:
Yeah.
STEVE:
What was that like?
It was horrible
because we were losing.
You knew what
was coming, right?
We were losing everybody,
and I just-- I just felt sick.
I've said
it's a difficult night.
It is a difficult night.
I know it's a difficult night.
You've been working so hard.
Even, you can be intellectually
prepared for something,
but to actually sit and watch
your friends lose their jobs
and lose the-- lose
all the work that they had done,
it just--
it just felt dreadful.
And for all the young people
who work in the campaigns,
I mean, it's a tough,
tough game, politics, you know?
Because, for every--
every campaign office
that was feeling
what we were feeling,
there was a campaign
office across the street
that was thrilled, right?
So, all those young
NDPers who were winning
and the Tories who were winning,
they were excited.
So...
(Inhaling sharply)
Yeah, it is what it is.
You won your own seat.
I did.
Did you want to?
It felt like...
(Sighing)
I mean, there were
people who said,
"Oh, I hope you lose,"
you know? But...
It's cleaner if you lose;
you can walk away.
I guess so.
I guess so.
But having won,
I felt like, "Okay, well,
"I won this seat in a sweep
that went the other way,"
and so, in an odd way,
that was validating
of my work and my team.
I didn't win by much.
I think it was
a couple of hundred votes.
You know, you want to--
you want to win your riding.
Um...
But yeah, it made it complicated
for me because, then,
for the next
couple of days,
weeks, the question
came at me constantly,
"Are you going to stay?
What are you going to do?"
I mean, I stepped down
from the leadership
because I'd already said I
wasn't going to--
I wasn't going to
stay in the leadership.
So, I stepped down that night.
But everybody said to me,
who was close to me, said,
"Don't-- don't say tonight
"whether you're going
to stay or not," you know?
And then, I made the decision
with my constituency team
that, you know,
I'd been re-elected
on this terrible night,
and it felt like,
"Why would I step down
"from people who have put
their trust in me yet again?
"Plus, we've only
got seven seats.
"If I step down and
we lose a by-election,
"you know, I will never
get over that," right?
So...
So, I also felt that staying and
being part of this little team,
supporting John Fraser
was important,
and it became even more
important as the weeks went on.
I am so glad
I stayed, Steve.
It was-- for me, personally,
it was a really
good thing to do.
I also have had enormous
feedback over the years
since then, people saying
how brave it was,
they liked that I stayed,
they thought it was
a strong thing to do.
"Other leaders don't stay,
but you stood and you--
you know, you were..."
I was a different voice in the
legislature than other voices
because I had been
the Premier, and I felt that,
and that's not--
that's not self-aggrandising.
That's just the reality
that I knew more
about what was
going on in the government
than a lot of the members on the
other side of the House did.
And so, it was I felt that
I had something to offer,
and so, I'm really glad
I made that decision to stay.
As you look back on your five
years and 138 days as Premier--
(Chuckling)
Only you know that number.
Now I do.
What stays with you?
Oh, man...
(Sighing)
Um...
Like, a specific thing
or what stays with me?
I mean, my immediate answer
is the honour of
having been in that chair,
the ability to, uh...
make a difference.
So, I'll use the example
of some of the, um...
violence against women
curriculum that we--
or not curriculum,
but policy that we brought in
when the beginning of the Me Too
movement thing was happening.
To be able to say to my staff,
"Okay, I want you to go to the
ministries involved...",
so Ministry of Health,
Ministry of the
Attorney General,
the Women's Directorate,
"...I want you to go
to all of these places,
"and I want you to--
I want you to ask them
"to bring forward
policy and ideas
"that we could
move on very quickly
"that could
strengthen this sector,
"that could put more
protections in place for women,
"for victims
of assault and so on."
I mean, to be able to
move that quickly on issues
that were so important,
to be able to put into budgets
direct funding for
increases of salaries
of female-dominated
professions,
our first budget
put money directly into
early childhood educators,
developmental support workers
and personal support workers,
you know, to be able
to pull those levers
that would have a direct
and immediate effect
on people's lives was--
it was amazing.
When we raised
the minimum wage, you know?
To this day, there are people
who work in grocery stores
who will say, if we hadn't had
that increase to $14 an hour,
then we wouldn't
be where we are now.
You know, we raised the floor
and changed people's
abilities to earn a living.
So...
(Inhaling sharply)
...the ability to make change
like that is-- it's heady stuff,
and it's what
I feel is the reward
for all the other crap
that you put up with.
How long does it take
before a former Premier
doesn't pick up
the paper every day
or look at an article
on her smartphone and think,
"If I were in that chair still,
"here's what
I would do about that"?
Well, I don't know
because I'm not there.
(Chuckling)
It hasn't happened yet.
Just, finally,
what are you doing these days?
Well,
I talk about this stuff.
I'm teaching.
I teach a couple of
public policy courses at U of T.
So, I get some
first-year kids in September
and some
fourth-year kids in January,
and we talk about
all these issues.
I've had lots of practice
talking about Hydro One,
when we come on that issue
with the fourth-year seminar.
So, I feel like everything
I'm doing right now--
outside of my
six grandkids and my family,
but everything else I'm doing
is trying to help people
have an opportunity
to ask the questions they wanna
ask about how government works,
about what it's like
to have been in that role,
and about why we made the
decisions that we made
and how they were made,
because people don't
understand how government works.
Why should they? You know,
most people haven't been there.
And I always remember there
were only 24 of me before,
you know, 24 people
before me in that chair.
So, I kind of feel I have an
obligation to be available
if people have questions,
and people do have questions.
A lot of people want
to know what it was like,
and they want to know
how we got to where we were.
Last question:
when one of those students that
you're teaching comes up to you,
as I suspect somebody
has done, and says,
"You know, Premier Wynne,
your example has proved to me,"
especially if it's
a female student,
"that I never want
to go into politics
"because I just couldn't stand
all that crap you went through,"
what's your response?
Well, actually,
some of them say that
at the beginning of the class.
They come in and they will say,
"I really-- you know,
"I don't like politics,
"and, you know, I'm just--
I'm taking this course
"because I need to
know more about Ontario,"
whatever the reason is.
"I don't really like politics,
"it's an elective," you know,
but they don't
say it at the end.
And there-- I have had-- what
I've had young people say is,
"You've changed
my mind about politics,
"you've changed my mind
about what can get done,"
and that's my mission,
you know, is to help young
people understand that,
while it is tough,
it is so worth it, you know?
I just can't imagine anything
that's more worthwhile
than making sure
that little kids have decent
schools to go to. You know?
So, I think that
it is really important
that politicians talk about the
good and the bad and the ugly
because there's
always going to be bad,
there's always going to be ugly,
but there's also always good,
and it is a worthy pursuit,
no matter what.
You know, there are pundits
who talk about, you know,
the elected politicians
like they are nobody.
They're not nobody.
They are somebody
in their communities,
and they are somebody who
is trying to solve problems,
and we can't forget that.
Thank you.
You're very welcome.
