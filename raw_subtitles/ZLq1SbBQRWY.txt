Do you ever close your laptop
at the end of a long day
and feel like you have just enough energy
to crawl over to the couch
to scroll on your phone or watch a show?
Or maybe both at the same time?
Yeah.
During the pandemic,
that was all I wanted to do
and I couldn't understand why.
I was safe, I was healthy,
why didn't I want to close my laptop
and go dance around the living room?
Where did all my energy go?
I'm a journalist.
My specialty for the last 10 years
has been trying to understand
how our tech habits change us as people,
and so I decided I was going to find out
why sitting in front of a screen
makes us feel so exhausted.
Because we have all heard
about the mental effects, right?
But what about our physical health?
Well, as I quickly learned,
looking at screens has not
only reshaped our days,
it is reshaping our bodies.
According to researchers at Johns Hopkins,
every day, the average
19-year-old moves about
as much as the average 60-year-old.
Over the last 20 years,
rates of type 2 diabetes
in young people have doubled.
Three in four American adults
has a chronic illness.
Many of those are preventable.
At least one chronic illness.
And the WHO says
that this is a global problem.
They predict that by the end
of the decade, which is not that far away,
this lifestyle will likely
lead to 500 million new cases
of preventable conditions
like heart disease, obesity and diabetes,
costing governments
27 billion dollars a year.
Typing, swiping, scrolling, sitting.
This is the rhythm of our modern life.
But I don't know about you,
I can't throw away my phone, right?
Like, I can't go off the grid.
So how can we stay connected
without slowly destroying our health?
That was the question
running through my mind
when I came across this guy.
Keith Diaz is a physiologist
at Columbia University Medical Center,
and he has spent his entire career
trying to figure out how little
can we get away with moving
so that sitting
doesn't kill us, basically.
And in 2022, he published a small study
that gives us a great idea.
He found that just five minutes
of gentle movement every 30 minutes
had dramatic effects.
It slashed blood sugar and blood pressure.
In another study,
he found that inactive people
who traded 30 minutes of sitting
for 30 minutes of movement every day
could lower their risk
of a premature death by 18 percent.
And so maybe you're like,
"Yeah, I worked out
this morning, so I'm good."
Or maybe you're like,
"Phew, I'm so glad
I got that standing desk."
I am so sorry, but no.
(Laughter)
If you sit or stand
for the majority of your waking hours,
your health is in jeopardy too.
"Don't stop working out," Keith told me,
but he said, what you have to do
is break up these long stretches
of sedentary screen time.
When he told me this, I was like, really?
Like, how big a difference
can these movement breaks make
for someone who is,
you know, relatively healthy?
I decided I would join the study.
So one day I went to his lab
and I sat and worked on my laptop
for eight hours straight.
The next day I took those movement breaks
every half hour or so.
They checked all my vital signs
and the results were
actually quite extraordinary.
My glucose was cut nearly in half.
My blood pressure was down by five points,
and my mood was so much better.
The science was clear,
but like, what did it matter if no one
could actually do these movement breaks?
Like it was easy in the lab.
Somebody tapped me on the shoulder
and led me over to the treadmill.
So we decided to ask people,
out in the world, out in real life,
to see if they could do it.
We, our teams at NPR and Columbia,
combined forces to create a podcast
and a global clinical trial
called the Body Electric study.
And over 20,000 people signed up.
We had to cap it at 20,000 people,
and they could choose a movement dose,
so they could move
five minutes every half hour,
five minutes every hour,
or every two hours.
They could dance around the house,
they could pace on calls,
they could walk the dog,
they could take out the trash,
it didn't matter.
They just had to break it up,
break up those long periods of sitting.
And you guys, I was so excited.
I was like, we are going
to launch a movement for movement.
Yeah, I've got a way with words.
(Laughter)
But I am not going to lie,
those first few days were so tough.
It takes a lot of intention
and a little rebellion
to upend a world that is quite literally
built around screens and chairs.
But when people figured it out,
when they started getting
those breaks into their lives,
they started having breakthroughs.
They told us that they felt less pain.
They told us that they had more energy.
They said that they felt
more positive about life in general.
In the end, of the people
who started taking movement breaks,
80 percent managed to stick
with them for two solid weeks.
And yes, this was a self-reported study
with a lot of very motivated participants.
Hello public radio.
But still,
the data showed that the more often
they took breaks,
the better they felt.
People who went outside
got an extra boost.
Some people lost a few
of those stubborn pounds,
and most people actually
liked taking the breaks.
But the biggest surprise to me
was that the breaks did
not hurt their productivity.
People said they got back to their desks
and they were able to focus,
and they felt that the work they did
was actually of better quality.
So this research is going through
the scientific process right now.
But Keith explained to me
some of the reasons
why these gentle breaks
can have such an outsized impact.
So when we sit,
our arteries get bent
at our hips and our knees,
kind of like a kinked vacuum hose.
Blood starts pooling in our legs
and our muscles stop contracting.
But leg muscles need to move,
be stimulated,
in order to clear out fat and sugar
and reduce blood pressure.
If they don't, over months and over years,
that's when those chronic conditions
can start to creep in.
And then there is our posture.
Sitting compresses the diaphragm.
We start taking shallow breaths.
Shallow breaths lead to less oxygen
going into our blood and up to our brain.
Less oxygen in our brain
means we get tired and lose focus.
Feel free to take a deep breath
right now if you want to.
And that is where screens
come into the picture.
So screens can mess
with something called interoception.
Interoception is the body's way
of telling you what it needs.
It needs a snack,
it needs to go to the bathroom,
it needs to move.
The more we focus on screens,
the less we listen to the signals
that our body is sending us.
Your body could be begging for a break,
but what do you do?
You keep scrolling past the anxiety,
scrolling past the exhaustion.
That eventually can lead to burnout, yes.
And again, those chronic conditions.
So how can you start
making a change in feeling better?
Well, first, think about your most
sedentary stretches of time
and then make yourself a mantra.
So like if you are a student,
you could say,
"I'll take an extra lap around the quad
before class instead of checking TikTok,
so I get to class with more oxygen
in my brain and I can actually focus."
Or if you work from home,
you could decide that on long Zoom calls,
"I will march in place
in order to manage my glucose
and avoid the post-meeting crash."
If you're a parent, you could say
"I will take a lap
around the soccer field once
so that I have enough energy
to get through the dinnertime chaos."
You can have a dance party
while you microwave your leftovers.
You can walk the concourse instead
of sitting and waiting for your flight.
A mix of all these habits
will keep your muscles firing
and your mood steadier.
My favorite story came
from a 43-year-old woman
named Dana, who works in HR.
So Dana was a type-2 diabetic
with all kinds of health issues.
Her doctor told her she needed
to take a long, brisk walk every morning,
and she was doing this,
but her numbers just were not changing.
So with her doctor's permission,
she decided to join the study.
She started fitting in movement breaks
between all of her meetings,
and within a couple of weeks,
she told me her blood
pressure dropped by 40 points,
her cholesterol went down
and her doctor told her
she could start tapering her insulin.
She's actually off all of her meds today.
Yay, Dana, we love you, Dana.
(Applause)
So we know that too much time online
is not great for our mental health.
But it's not just in our heads,
it's in our bodies.
We need movement to be as much a part
of our lives as screens are.
We need our schools,
our neighborhoods, our workplaces
to give us time and space just to move.
You can help push this reset forward.
Take movement breaks.
And when people look at you
like you're weird,
just tell them why you're doing it.
Because you just want
to feel a little better.
Get them to put down
their phone and join you.
Start soon, start small.
Should we start now?
Yeah, can we have some music?
You could do --
you could do the march.
You could do the shuffle.
Little hands in the air,
if you can't get up.
Feel it.
You're alive.
You're alive.
Love you guys.
(Cheers and applause)
