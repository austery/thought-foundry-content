We cut the crucible in half and we're attaching two pieces of thermally resistant glass, each 4mm thick, as a window into the reaction. People said this would be impossible, that you wouldn't be able to see anything, or that the glass would just break. We've never done this on camera. I've always seen it this way, this clear. And I think it's going to be fascinating to then start to analyze and make sense of this. Now this glass has been specially treated so it shouldn't shatter immediately when it comes into contact with molten metal, but the melting temperature of silica is around 1700 degrees Celsius Which is definitely lower than the temperature of the reaction. For this reaction we'll be using iron thermite So a combination of iron oxide and aluminum metal. Okay, that's good. Let's do this. Holy mo-- Oh no, the GoPro! Oh boy. Oh no. Oh no. That's the end of the GoPro. The reaction starts at the igniter and expands outwards in all directions. To me it almost looks like ants or mold or something. It looks organic in how it's sort of spreading. You see a pulse. Boom, boom, boom. It's living. Yeah, that's what it looks like. We never knew that it did that. We do this for a hundred years and suddenly you find out that. Do you think that's gas escaping up? And that's almost what causes the pulsing, like some gas heats up and then it shoots up and then it makes space for the next one? It's what you seem to see over here. Yeah. Whoa, that is hot. That is really hot. I mean this is impressive work for a camera that's on fire.
