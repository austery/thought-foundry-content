[music]


We're
 talking
 today
 about
 identity
 for


AI
 agents
 and
 how
 we
 authorize
 uh


agents,
 MCP
 servers
 and
 uh
 the


Um,
 we
 launched
 a
 new
 product
 uh


actually
 this
 week.
 So,
 uh,
 that
 made


this
 presentation
 fun.
 [laughter]
 Uh,


had
 a
 major
 release
 just
 a
 few
 days
 ago


um,
 for
 several
 of
 these
 features
 and


ging
 these.
 Um,
 um,
 additionally,
 I


should
 probably
 preface
 by
 saying
 a
 lot


of
 this
 workshop
 material
 has
 been


repurposed
 and
 um,
 our
 our
 architect
 uh,


Abbyek,
 he
 goes
 by
 nicknames


Shrek.


um
 kind
 of
 prepared
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 and


we've
 kind
 of
 massaged
 it
 into
 this


presentation.


Um
 yeah,
 so
 we're
 going
 to
 cover
 each
 of


these
 in
 depth.
 um
 some
 of
 the
 core


features
 of
 this
 new
 release
 whether


it's
 token
 vault
 um
 async
 off
 we're
 not


going
 deep
 on
 FGA
 but
 uh
 just
 know
 that


there
 is
 another
 kind
 of
 subproduct
 if


you
 will
 that's
 all
 around
 role
 based


access
 control
 um
 there's
 an
 open-


source
 project
 around
 fine
 grain
 do
 off


um
 which
 really
 extends
 this
 feature
 set


but
 that's
 really
 kind
 of
 another
 talk


Um,


so
 yeah,
 that's
 some
 of
 the
 things
 we'll


be
 talking.
 Uh,
 quick
 intros.
 Uh,
 uh,


it's
 my
 first
 time
 at
 AIE,
 so
 thank
 you


guys.
 It's
 been
 awesome
 week
 already.


Learned
 so
 much.
 Um,
 um,
 yeah,
 I'm
 I'm


from
 Raleigh,
 not
 not
 actually
 a
 Shire,


but
 [laughter]


uh,
 this
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 me.
 Um,


and,
 uh,
 yeah,
 it's
 been
 great.
 I
 came


over
 from
 Duasio
 from
 Red
 Hat
 and
 I've


learned
 a
 lot
 about
 the
 identity
 space


in
 the
 last
 four
 years.
 Um
 I'm
 going
 to


roll
 over
 to
 Carlos.


>> Yeah.
 Hi.
 Um
 yeah,
 I'm
 I'm
 Carlos.
 I'm


co-host
 with
 uh
 Patrick
 for
 this


workshop
 today.
 Um
 first
 time
 in
 New


York,
 first
 time
 in
 the
 US.
 So
 great
 so


far.
 Uh
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 welcoming.
 Um


I'm
 best
 in
 Spain
 in
 Mayor
 if
 you
 know


the
 place
 it's
 a
 beautiful
 island.
 Um
 I


joined
 Al
 and
 Octa.
 Um
 I
 did
 a
 bit
 more


two
 years


father
 of
 two
 and
 well
 yeah
 it's
 a


little
 bit
 of
 about
 myself.


So
 I'm
 going
 to
 I
 want
 to
 start
 this


with
 a
 vision
 that
 I'll
 zero
 share.
 uh


this
 is
 uh
 to
 free
 everyone
 to
 safely


use
 any
 technology


and
 the
 fun
 fact
 about
 this
 is
 is
 a


vision
 that
 precedes
 the
 AI
 Asian
 era
 uh


and
 still
 stands
 uh
 because
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day
 is
 what
 what
 we
 do
 uh
 we
 deal


with
 identity
 for
 past,
 present
 and


future
 technology
 and
 yeah
 um


just
 to
 give
 a
 little
 bit
 of


what's
 the
 challenge.
 Um
 so
 I
 said
 that


our
 vision
 is
 just
 to to
 free
 uh
 anyone


to
 use
 any
 technology
 but
 it
 doesn't


mean
 that
 all
 the
 technologies
 are
 the


same
 and
 all
 the
 technologies
 has
 the


same
 uh
 challenges.
 It's
 obvious
 that


agents
 bring
 new
 challenges,
 new


threats.
 And
 just
 to
 illustrate,
 this
 is


an
 updated
 list
 of
 the
 OASP
 uh
 LFO
 top


10.
 Um


so
 you
 can
 see
 new
 things
 that
 they


didn't
 exist
 before.
 So
 yeah,
 obviously


we
 need
 to
 to
 solve
 new
 problems.


Um


so
 how
 how
 we
 modeled
 or
 how
 we
 think
 of


agents
 in
 our
 data.
 So


we
 think
 yeah
 so
 far
 we've
 seen


interactive
 agents
 chat
 box
 code
 editors


but
 this
 is
 unlikely
 the
 the
 future.


we
 start
 to
 see
 other
 uh
 modalities


where
 the
 agents
 doesn't
 run
 anymore
 in


a
 in
 interactive
 way.
 Um
 dash
 runners
 or


autonomous
 agents
 is
 something
 that
 is


very
 popular
 these
 days.


But
 beyond
 that


we
 see
 a
 feature
 where
 fully
 autonomous


agents
 can
 do
 things
 uh
 either
 on
 behalf


of
 the
 users
 or
 maybe
 just
 because


agents
 will
 start
 talk
 to
 other
 agents.


So
 this
 is
 how
 these
 are
 four
 pillars


that
 we
 believe
 will
 cover
 all
 these
 new


modalities.
 The
 first
 one
 is


AI
 needs
 to
 know
 who
 I
 am.
 So
 this
 is


this
 is
 key.
 Uh
 if
 the
 agent
 doesn't


know
 who
 I
 am,
 it
 can
 never
 apply
 any


security
 or
 any
 restriction
 or
 any


authoration
 authentication
 because


>> I'm
 just
 an
 anonymous


source
 or
 actor
 in
 this
 and
 this
 is


important.
 The
 second
 is


obviously
 the
 agents
 will
 be
 autonomous


enough
 but
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 we'll
 be


alone.
 It
 will
 be
 just
 doing
 things
 on


its
 own.
 Eventually
 they
 will
 need
 to


access
 other
 services
 to
 consume
 other


resources.
 So
 AI
 needs
 to
 call
 APIs
 on


on
 my
 behalf
 as
 a
 user.


But
 sooner
 or
 later
 the
 agent
 will
 try


to
 do
 something
 riskier
 or
 something


that
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 as
 a
 user
 the


agent
 should
 do
 on
 its
 own
 uh
 without


any
 supervision
 uh
 from
 my
 side.
 So
 AI


can
 request
 my
 confirmation


and
 lastly
 um
 AI
 access


should
 be
 fine
 grain.
 So
 I
 need
 to
 to


give
 the
 agent
 control
 to
 access
 my


resources
 but
 not
 any
 resource,
 not
 any


collection
 or
 document
 or
 anything.
 It's


just
 it
 has
 to
 be
 on
 my
 hands
 to
 what


the
 agent
 can
 access
 and
 what
 not.


And
 just
 to
 to
 also
 introduce


where
 octa
 and
 alto
 can
 play
 or


complement
 each
 other.


So
 we
 talked
 about
 a
 user
 and
 it
 could


be
 me,
 it
 could
 be
 you
 but
 eventually


will
 be
 an
 employee
 within
 an
 enterprise


or
 a
 company
 and
 in
 this
 case
 the


employee
 is
 not
 only
 acting
 on
 his
 own


behalf
 is
 also
 representing
 the
 company


and
 in
 in
 those
 cases
 the
 company
 needs


also
 control
 what
 exactly
 those
 agents


that
 are
 acting
 on
 behalf
 those


employees
 are
 doing.
 So
 that's
 where
 uh


Opta
 also
 plays
 a
 uh
 important
 part
 and


in
 the
 other
 end
 Alzero
 is
 what
 we
 uh


the
 the
 capabilities
 and
 features
 that


we've
 implemented
 I
 think
 is
 where
 they


connect.
 Yeah.


>> Just
 trying
 to
 understand
 you
 said
 the


agents
 need
 to
 know
 who
 you
 are.


>> Yes.


>> Who
 you
 are
 is
 what
 as
 the
 user
 and
 the


coder
 and
 the
 one
 with
 the
 permissions.


uh
 is
 the
 subject
 of
 the
 the
 the


operation
 that
 you're
 doing.
 Like
 it


could
 be
 anything.
 It
 could
 be
 you
 as
 an


employee.
 It
 could
 be
 you
 as
 an
 owner
 or


something
 as
 an
 administrator
 or


something.
 But
 at
 the
 end
 is
 a
 person
 a


human.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> In
 in
 the
 scenario
 I
 was
 talking
 about.


>> Is
 is
 this
 what


what
 permission
 the
 agent
 have
 access
 to


or
 who
 has
 access
 to
 the
 Asian


capabilities?


I'm
 not
 like
 I
 don't
 understand


>> both.
 Yeah.


>> What
 does
 that
 two
 here?


>> We're
 sorry.


>> We
 are
 definitely
 touching
 on
 both.
 So


yes,
 let's
 Yes.
 And
 time
 for
 your


questions
 at
 the
 end.
 Absolutely.
 Let's


make
 sure.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you.


>> All right.
 So
 let's
 get
 deep
 on
 exactly


what
 we
 are
 going
 to
 present
 today.
 Uh


we
 talk
 about
 four
 pillars.
 um
 not
 in
 a


particular
 order
 but
 we
 are
 I'm
 going
 to


introduce
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 three
 which
 is


or
 how
 we
 made
 possible
 one
 of
 the
 three


which
 is
 um
 AI
 can
 request
 my
 approval.


Um
 for
 that
 we
 implemented
 a
 sync
 O
 as


part
 of
 the
 O
 for
 uh
 AI
 us
 offering
 and


basically
 [snorts]
 this
 feature
 what
 it


does
 is
 creates
 a
 mechanism
 and
 and
 a


protocol
 for
 the
 agent
 to
 reach
 out
 the


user
 when
 an
 operation
 needs
 to
 be


approved
 by
 the
 human
 in
 in in
 this


flow.


It's
 seems
 simple.
 Um


it
 it
 is
 in
 in
 [snorts]
 essence
 but
 well


it's
 security
 [laughter]


but
 uh
 on
 it's
 built
 on
 top
 of
 uh
 client


initiated
 authentication
 uh
 sorry
 client


initiated
 back
 channel
 authentication


protocol.
 It's
 an
 ITC
 uh
 specification


and
 it's
 yeah
 so
 in
 this
 scenario
 is
 the


agent
 that
 it's
 initiating
 the


authentication
 and
 authorization.


So
 the
 agent
 is
 running
 maybe
 it
 could


be
 a
 long
 run
 autonomous
 thing
 and
 at


some
 point
 needs
 to
 make
 a
 purchase
 or


make
 something
 that
 is
 flagged
 as
 risk.


Uh
 so
 with
 with
 a
 sync
 uh
 with
 a
 simple


SDK
 call
 it
 can
 initiate
 um


an
 authorization
 request
 that


materializes
 a
 notification
 to
 the
 user.


The
 user
 receives
 the
 details
 of
 that


transaction
 well
 structured.
 The
 user


acknowledges
 that,
 approves
 that
 and


then
 that
 approval
 gets
 back
 to
 the
 to


the
 agent
 in
 form
 of
 an
 access
 token.


And
 that
 access
 token
 contains
 the
 exact


details
 that
 the
 user
 approved.


And
 yeah,
 I'm
 going
 to
 hand
 over
 to


Patrick
 for
 this
 one.


>> Awesome.
 Yeah,
 thank
 you
 Carlos.
 And


yeah,
 good
 question.
 Thank
 you
 both


questions.
 the
 the
 token
 vault
 as
 the


other
 kind
 of
 like
 you
 know
 major


feature
 we're
 introducing
 with
 this
 AI


more
 AI
 targeted
 AIO
 release
 um
 token


vault
 is
 a
 new
 mechanism
 for
 persisting


your
 upstream
 uh
 resource
 refresh
 tokens


so
 I'm
 sorry
 refresh
 tokens
 and
 you
 may


have
 used
 oor
 before
 right
 for
 social


providers
 um
 or
 in
 tangent
 with
 like


other
 identity
 providers


Um
 this
 makes
 use
 cases
 with
 agents
 much


much
 easier.
 Um
 so
 we
 we
 we
 have
 a


really
 fine
 grained
 now
 flow
 which


allows
 you
 to
 exchange
 tokens.
 So
 on
 on


behalf
 of
 users
 so
 I
 can
 you
 know
 I
 can


send
 my
 access
 token
 or
 my
 application's


refresh
 token
 um
 whether
 it's
 for
 an
 API


whether
 it's
 for
 my
 application
 um
 and
 I


can
 then
 request
 scopes
 for
 an
 upstream


uh
 you
 know
 service.
 So
 whether
 that's


accessing
 Slack
 API
 or
 Facebook
 API
 or


um
 any
 any
 other
 identity
 you
 know
 uh


scoped
 API
 and
 so
 yeah
 and
 we
 we


actually
 persist
 scopes
 we
 manage


lifetimes
 of
 tokens
 um
 we
 do
 a
 lot
 of


handling
 there
 to
 ensure
 that
 your
 SDK


life
 is
 very
 easy
 um
 and
 that
 your
 agent


stays
 online
 and
 it's
 it's
 it's


available
 and
 it's
 secure
 u
 um
 yeah


we've
 been
 testing
 this
 flow
 really


extensively.
 Um,
 but
 you
 can
 kind
 of
 get


a
 picture
 of
 what
 is
 going
 on
 under
 the


hood
 and
 um,
 yeah,
 we'll
 talk
 more
 about


token
 vault
 in
 the
 in
 the
 shop.
 It'll


make
 a
 lot
 more
 sense
 when
 we
 get
 in


there.
 Um,
 I
 do
 want
 to
 kind
 of


highlight
 a
 few
 flows
 though.
 Um,
 where


you
 know
 I
 mentioned
 refresh
 token
 and


access
 token.
 um
 as
 we
 are
 digesting


each
 of
 the
 agentic
 frameworks
 you
 can


kind
 of
 see
 that
 well
 it
 may
 differ
 if


you're
 using
 a
 single
 page
 app
 right
 and


uh
 you
 know
 you're
 you
 don't
 have
 a


backend
 which
 is
 as
 you
 know
 uh
 as


secure
 you're
 or
 you're
 wanting
 to


access
 an
 external
 API
 um
 in
 these
 cases


especially
 like
 with
 langraph
 uh
 we
 we


use
 an
 access
 token
 it's
 shortlived


access
 token
 um
 that's
 simply
 because


langraph
 stands
 up
 an
 external
 API
 um


there's
 a
 langraph
 protocol
 around
 the


langraph
 CLI.
 So
 yeah,
 in
 this
 case
 like


we
 kind
 of
 model
 that
 flow
 whereas
 like


other
 flows
 you
 may
 just
 have
 a
 native


app
 or
 a
 simple
 Nex.js
 regular
 web
 app


um
 traditional
 web
 app
 with
 your
 agent


running
 embedded.
 Um
 then
 yeah
 in
 this


case
 like
 a
 refresh
 token
 may
 fits
 your


use
 case
 perfectly
 fine.
 Um,
 and
 then
 I


think
 as
 we're
 going
 to
 talk
 later,


there's
 also
 cases
 where,
 you
 know,


maybe
 you
 have
 an
 asynchronous
 agent


accessing
 other
 data.
 Um,
 we
 have
 a
 new


mechanism
 now
 called
 a
 custom
 API


client.
 Um,
 which
 can
 allow
 an
 MCP


server
 for
 example
 to
 access
 remote


data.
 Um,
 so
 that's
 kind
 of
 the


conceptually
 what
 we've
 done
 at
 Ozero.


We've
 taken
 agent,
 we've
 kind
 of
 modeled


it
 as
 a
 client
 and
 we've
 taken
 your
 APIs


and
 kind
 of
 modeled
 them
 as
 traditional


OOTH
 resource
 servers
 or
 APIs
 in
 our


platform.
 Um,
 so
 yeah,
 that's
 a
 little


bit
 what's
 going
 on
 here.
 I've
 kind
 of


listed
 some
 details
 about
 token
 exchange


on
 the
 [laughter]
 slide.
 Um,
 yes,
 that


just
 know
 that
 the
 subject
 token
 type
 is


kind
 of
 type
 of
 exchange
 whether
 access


or
 refresh.
 The
 subject
 token
 is
 your


your
 token.
 um
 [snorts]


the
 user
 token
 be
 in
 exchange
 for
 the


third
 party
 token.
 Um


let's
 see.
 This
 is
 a
 really
 quick
 GIF
 of


um
 our
 interrupt
 flow
 with
 Lingraph.
 Uh


recently
 wrote
 this.
 Um
 so
 it
 just
 shows


kind
 of
 you
 know
 what
 the
 what
 the


mechanism
 looks
 like.
 If
 the
 the
 prompt


says
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 need
 access
 to
 my


calendar,
 we
 have
 a
 a
 Google
 social


provider.
 um
 we
 have
 an
 interrupt
 you


know
 as
 part
 of
 our
 SDK
 it
 will
 feed
 you


back
 the
 the
 mention
 that
 you
 need
 to


request
 additional
 scopes
 we
 then
 do
 the


token
 exchange
 from
 token
 vault
 get
 you


a
 new
 access
 token
 and
 then
 you
 can
 up


access
 your
 upstream
 provider
 um
 really


quite
 simple
 in
 our
 in
 our
 framework
 now


um
 quickly
 about
 MCP
 and
 then
 we'll
 dive


into
 the
 workshop
 um
 MCP
 [snorts]
 is


very
 new
 for
 us
 we
 just
 launched
 a


preview
 Um
 but
 we've
 been
 avidly
 working


on
 this
 for
 quite
 some
 time.
 Um
 but


yeah,
 you
 can
 kind
 of
 see
 where
 we've


modeled
 the
 MCP
 server
 also
 as
 a
 client.


Um
 and
 yes,
 there
 are
 cases
 where
 agent


is
 a
 client
 talking
 to
 MCP
 server
 which


is
 also
 a
 client
 talking
 to
 upstream


APIs.
 So
 um
 and
 that's
 that's
 actually


what
 I'm
 going
 to
 show
 today.
 [laughter]


Um
 but
 yes,
 the
 the
 flow
 is
 quite


similar
 and
 we'll
 talk
 more
 about
 MCP


semantics
 and
 um
 you
 know
 how
 we've


implemented
 dynamic
 client
 registration


and
 um
 kind
 of
 what
 we
 have
 here.
 Uh


these
 are
 totally
 from
 our
 teammates.
 So


[laughter]


just
 trying
 to
 pick
 our
 favorite
 slides.


Um
 and
 yeah
 um
 as
 far
 as
 the
 workshop
 uh


I
 think
 we're
 planning
 to
 just
 kind
 of


highle
 high
 note
 each
 section.
 Um,
 if


you
 don't
 want
 to
 work
 through
 it,


that's
 okay.
 You
 can
 follow
 along.
 If


you
 want
 to
 work
 through
 it
 and
 you're


more
 hands-on,
 um,
 that's
 fine,
 too.
 Um,


and
 yeah,
 we
 really
 truly
 appreciate
 all


your
 feedback.
 We
 do
 have
 time
 at
 the


end
 for
 questions
 and
 all
 kinds
 of


feedback.
 So,
 um,
 we
 would
 love
 that.


And,
 um,
 yeah,
 this
 is
 what
 we
 are


building,
 um,
 today.
 Um,


basically,
 we
 are
 building
 an
 agent


Nex.js
 app.
 Um
 what's
 nice
 about
 Vcel's


platform,
 right,
 is
 we
 can
 build
 MCP


tools
 alongside
 our
 agent
 in
 the
 same


infrastructure
 quickly.
 We
 can
 then
 use


the
 agent
 client
 to
 communicate
 with
 the


MCP
 server
 and
 then
 leverage
 the
 MCP


server
 to
 talk
 to
 third
 parties.
 So
 um


that's
 really
 powerful
 and
 you
 know
 it's


secure
 and
 it's
 easy
 to
 build.
 um
 you


know
 we
 we
 feel
 quite
 good
 about
 several


areas
 of
 this
 the
 security
 stack
 there


but
 yeah
 I
 think
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 the


rough
 idea
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 typical
 flows


you
 might
 see
 um
 you
 know
 in
 the


industry
 um
 yeah
 so
 uh
 I'm
 going
 to
 yeah


so
 we
 can
 pull
 it
 up
 and
 get
 going
 uh
 so


let's
 see
 uh
 yeah
 hopefully
 everybody
 is


able
 to
 capture
 the
 link
 Um


and


>> all
 right.
 Uh
 so
 yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 while
 while
 Patrick
 is
 um


showing
 and
 kind
 of
 doing
 the
 workshop,


um
 I'll
 be
 available
 for
 anyone
 has
 a


question
 or
 uh
 a
 problem
 with
 with
 the


workshop
 itself.
 Just
 raise
 your
 hand.
 I


will
 approach
 you.


>> Awesome.
 Awesome.


Yeah.
 and
 then
 I'll
 do
 like
 a
 quick


intro
 then
 kind
 of
 showcase
 what
 it
 does


and
 we'll
 kind
 of
 step
 through
 this


journey
 of
 building
 that
 topology.
 Um


so


yeah
 uh
 but
 welcome
 is
 really
 just


around
 getting
 your
 dependencies
 and


getting
 um
 a
 a
 client.
 Um
 so
 I
 guess
 the


first
 step
 here
 we
 we
 have
 a
 a
 root


tenant
 an
 upstream
 IDP
 for
 you.
 So
 this


is
 kind
 of
 a
 little
 more
 of
 an


enterprise
 use
 case.
 So
 let's
 say
 you


have
 a
 a
 core
 IDP
 provider
 um
 that
 you


know
 you
 you
 tap
 into
 for
 like
 upstream


API
 management
 or
 upstream
 identity.
 Um


so
 we
 have
 this
 like
 fictitious
 uh
 stock


trade
 application
 uh
 which
 looks
 like


this.
 Um
 and
 this
 application
 basically


the
 idea
 is
 is
 that
 you
 know
 consumers


can
 come
 here
 they
 can
 access
 a
 stock


API
 they
 can
 establish
 identity
 here
 but


this


this
 application
 also
 exposes
 a
 stock
 an


API
 for
 downstream
 consumers
 and


downstream
 agent
 clients
 and
 and


additional
 consumers.
 So
 we
 have
 a


basically
 a
 link
 a
 federated
 a
 linked


access
 uh
 with
 our
 ODC
 connection
 um
 to


this
 to
 this
 tenant.
 Um
 so
 yeah
 uh
 so


the
 first
 part
 is
 really
 just
 um
 getting


your
 um
 your
 client.
 Um,
 I
 already
 have


a
 client,
 but
 where
 you
 would
 start
 here


is
 basically
 just
 um
 going
 through


Ozer's
 stack
 and
 getting
 um


uh
 a
 tenant
 and
 starting
 to
 get
 your


client
 developer
 keys.
 Um


so
 we'll
 add
 O
 as
 the
 as
 a
 subsequent


step,
 but
 I'll
 show
 the
 like
 the
 first


step
 where
 we
 just
 have
 a
 really
 simple


agent
 and
 then
 we're
 we're
 adding
 on
 um


identity
 and
 then
 authorization.


Uh


so
 so
 yeah
 these
 are
 some
 prerequisites


node
 PNP


standard
 toys
 um
 OS
 CLI
 so
 we
 use
 a
 CLI


for
 a
 lot
 of
 CLI
 management
 of
 our
 stack


it
 makes
 some
 things
 easier
 we
 use
 a


combination
 of
 Terraform
 and
 CLIs
 um
 in


this
 demo
 um


um
 [sighs and gasps]
 yeah
 so
 that's
 kind


of
 the
 conceptual
 overview
 and
 some
 of


the
 like
 major
 dependencies
 Um,
 after


you've
 created
 your
 your
 client
 and
 kind


of
 signed
 up
 here,
 um,
 we've
 got
 a
 link


to
 it
 here.
 Um,
 you
 should
 be
 ready
 to


go
 for
 spinning
 up
 your
 tenant.
 Um,
 but


yeah,
 I'll
 talk
 more
 about
 that
 in
 step


two.
 Um,
 so
 yeah,
 let's
 start
 with
 the


very
 beginnings
 here.
 Um,
 so
 we're
 in


this
 step,
 we're
 just
 we're
 we're


building
 our
 downstream
 chatbot.
 Um,


this
 is
 a
 downstream
 application
 that


we're
 just
 spinning
 up.
 hasn't
 connected


to
 anything
 yet
 and
 we're
 adding
 we're


adding
 on
 this
 upstream
 provider
 and


adding
 on
 access
 um
 with
 agents
 and
 with


tools.
 Um


and
 so
 yeah
 uh
 I
 used
 OpenAI
 with
 my


agent
 but
 yeah
 you'll
 need
 uh
 an
 open


API
 access
 key.
 Um
 this
 is
 the
 repo


which
 has
 the
 base
 um
 the
 base
 template.


I'll
 give
 you
 a
 branch
 at
 the
 end
 which


has
 all
 of
 the
 changes
 we
 make
 in
 this


workshop.
 Um


and


um
 yeah,
 so
 let's
 take
 a
 look
 at
 what


that
 looks
 like.
 Go
 for


agent.


Okay.


Oops.
 [snorts]


Okay.


Go
 for
 it.


One,
 two.


>> Sure.


>> So,
 well,
 yes,
 standard
 uh
 chat
 box.
 Um


so
 at
 this
 point
 when
 when
 when
 you


start
 if
 you
 try
 to
 do
 anything
 other


than
 just
 regular
 gen
 AI
 questions
 you


will
 get
 just
 the
 model
 nothing
 else
 but


um
 the
 important
 part
 is
 if
 we
 try
 to
 to


ask
 the
 model
 who
 who
 I
 am


>> that's
 when
 the
 model
 then
 says
 okay
 I


don't
 know
 who
 you
 are
 I
 don't
 know
 what


they
 is
 so
 I
 don't
 I
 know
 nothing.


The
 same
 for
 in
 this
 case
 this
 is
 a


downstream
 of
 a
 trade
 uh
 app.
 If
 you
 try


to
 consume
 data
 from
 that
 trading


service
 like
 again
 the
 chatbot
 will
 tell


you
 I
 know
 nothing.
 Uh
 so
 let's
 let's


fix
 that.
 uh
 let's
 give
 uh
 the
 chat
 box


awareness
 uh
 first
 of
 the
 service
 uh
 and


tools
 and
 then
 also
 [clears throat]


>> authentication.
 So
 let's
 let's


authenticate
 and
 let
 the
 the
 agent
 know


who
 who
 I
 am.


>> Okay.


>> Uh


>> so
 that's
 okay.
 Yeah,
 keep
 going.
 I'm


going
 to
 apply
 this.


>> So
 well


I
 will
 try
 to
 sing
 with
 Patrick
 here.


>> Yeah.
 [laughter]


>> Um
 yeah,
 this
 is
 pretty
 standard.
 I


think
 you
 saw
 this
 in
 several
 workshops


already
 just
 today
 and
 imagine
 several


times
 in
 the
 last
 weeks
 but
 yeah
 we
 are


uh
 in
 the
 basel
 uh
 AI
 SDKs
 we
 will


introduce
 the
 uh
 get
 stock
 price
 tool


>> um
 and
 later
 the
 uh
 authentication
 part.


So,
 let's
 go
 for
 the
 simple
 thing.
 Um,


in
 this
 case,
 Patrick
 is
 cheating


because
 he
 has
 all
 everything
 stashed.


>> Won't
 be
 that
 easy
 for
 you
 guys,
 but


>> um


>> rest
 assured
 that
 uh
 let's
 run
 it
 again.


Um
 I


>> was
 going
 to
 say
 rest
 assured
 all
 of
 the


code
 that's
 here
 is
 is
 in
 this
 stash.


So,
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 worry
 about
 that.


So,
 um,
 let's
 go
 back
 to
 the
 chat
 box


and
 let's
 ask
 again
 about
 prices.


>> You
 guys
 want
 us
 to
 try
 to
 follow
 along?


You're
 going
 to
 do
 an
 overview.


>> Okay.


>> Like,
 am
 I
 supposed
 to
 try
 to
 keep
 up


with
 what
 you're
 doing?


>> Yeah,
 that's
 hard,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 [laughter]


>> Let's
 let's
 let's
 complete
 everything,


right?
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Good.
 Good


call.


>> You
 can
 tell
 it's
 the
 first
 time
 we
 run


inspection.
 [laughter]


Great.


>> Pretty
 awesome.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 let
 let's
 let's let's


make
 an
 actual
 or
 let's
 start
 uh
 with
 a


um
 trading
 questions
 or
 at least
 get


info
 questions
 about
 it.
 Okay,
 cool.
 So,


now
 we've
 got
 the
 chat
 box


um
 connected
 to
 the
 upstream
 API.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 Uh
 in
 this
 case
 it's
 a


public
 service.
 It's
 a
 public
 endpoint.


So
 no
 authentication
 association
 was


required


>> right


>> let's
 try
 so
 let's
 move
 along.


>> Um


>> there
 are
 more


info
 in
 that
 page
 but


>> sorry.


>> Yeah
 no
 no
 no
 it's
 okay.
 I
 was
 going
 to


say
 that
 let's
 go
 back
 to
 the
 kind
 of


important
 stuff.


>> Okay.


>> Um


all
 right.


What
 happens
 if
 we
 want
 to
 read
 not


public
 uh
 data
 from
 [snorts]
 the


upstream
 service
 but
 personalized
 data


so
 data
 that
 I
 as
 a
 resource
 owner
 own


in
 this
 case
 is
 we
 are
 going
 to
 use
 uh


token
 board
 so
 basically
 when
 when
 we


logged
 in
 can
 you
 go
 back
 uh
 the
 chat


box


>> yeah
 yeah yeah


>> so
 so
 far
 we
 didn't
 go
 through
 any
 login


process
 so
 there
 is
 no
 who
 I
 am
 or


anything
 like
 so
 it's
 just
 um
 anonymous


uh
 session
 so
 far
 but
 at
 some
 point
 we


will
 log
 in
 we
 will
 log
 in
 in
 the
 uh


Asian
 IDE


>> right
 and
 but
 that
 will
 give
 us
 a


relation
 a
 trust
 relationship
 between
 us


and
 the
 Asian
 alone


we
 need
 to
 go
 beyond
 that
 we
 need
 to


establish
 a
 relationship
 also
 it's
 kind


of
 a
 a
 three-way
 thing
 it's
 us
 is
 the


upstream
 service
 and
 the
 agent
 so
 we


need
 to
 establish
 this
 triangle


relationship,
 right?
 And
 we
 do
 that
 we


will
 do
 that
 through
 token
 bot.
 We
 will


uh
 first
 authenticate
 the
 agent
 that
 in


exchange
 well
 issue
 an
 ID
 token
 and
 an


access
 token
 u
 an
 access
 token
 that


basically
 authorize
 us
 to
 use
 the
 agent


alone.
 But
 we
 can
 with
 token
 bowl
 we
 can


use
 uh
 once
 we
 establish
 the
 third


relationship
 we
 can
 use
 that
 access


token
 to
 exchange
 to
 exchange
 it
 by
 an


upstream
 access
 token.
 Yeah.
 And
 that's


what
 token
 does.
 What
 it
 does
 is
 once
 we


connect
 our
 upstream
 app,
 in
 this
 case


the
 demo
 trade
 app,


Alzero
 will
 start
 storing
 the
 refresh


token


and
 dealing
 with
 the
 issuance
 that
 of


the
 access
 tokens.
 So
 we
 store
 the


refresh
 token,
 we
 store
 the
 the
 access


token
 for
 as
 long
 as
 it
 it
 until
 it


expires.
 And
 every
 time
 the
 agent
 needs


to
 access
 this
 data,
 it
 runs
 the
 refresh


token
 uh
 grant
 to
 obtain
 a
 new
 access


token
 and
 that
 is
 issued
 back
 to
 the


agent.
 So


>> can
 you
 Yeah,
 that's
 that's
 more
 or
 less


the
 the
 graph.
 Can
 I
 yeah
 jump
 to
 uh


>> so
 yes
 um
 you
 know
 it's
 also
 going
 to


show
 just
 adding
 the
 basic
 off
 for
 your


user
 and
 and
 built
 and
 then
 adding
 on


these
 these
 token
 vault
 requests.
 Um
 the


so
 SDK
 code
 here
 kind
 of
 walks
 you


through
 like
 the
 sign
 up
 the
 terraform


all
 of
 the
 tenant
 setup
 um
 so
 that
 you


can
 start
 to
 use
 these
 services,
 right?


so
 that
 you
 can
 access
 token
 mold
 so
 you


can
 start
 using
 identity
 with
 providers.


Um
 this
 is
 a
 very
 new
 feature
 set
 with


some
 of
 these
 features.
 So
 you'll
 you'll


notice
 like
 in
 some
 of
 our
 configuration


you're
 enabling
 a
 connected
 accounts


feature
 with
 our
 new
 my
 account
 API.
 Um


you're
 you
 know
 setting
 up
 grant
 types


for
 your
 client
 application,
 your
 agent


[snorts]
 application.
 Um,
 and
 you're


configuring
 your
 OIDC
 connection.
 Um,


um,
 so
 yeah.
 Um,
 [sighs]


I
 don't
 know
 if
 we
 want
 to.
 Let's
 keep


moving
 and
 then
 we
 can
 kind
 of
 show
 the


tenant.
 Um,


>> um,
 but
 these
 are
 kind
 of
 the
 steps,
 um,


we
 can
 apply
 to
 just
 add
 a
 basic


identity.
 And
 yeah,
 I'll
 turn
 to
 you


while
 I'm
 doing
 that.


>> Yeah,
 TDR,
 all
 the
 steps
 are
 there.
 uh


references,
 links,
 and
 everything
 you


need
 in
 case
 you
 want
 this
 to
 want
 to
 do


this
 later
 or
 at
 home.


>> Uh
 all
 right.
 [clears throat]
 So,


>> let's
 try.
 So,
 the


>> So,
 at
 this
 point,
 what
 we're
 going
 to


do
 is
 bring
 the
 login
 button
 to
 the


agent
 basically.


>> Um


>> just
 kind
 of
 show
 what
 that
 looks
 like.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 uh
 route.


>> Yeah.
 So,


>> so
 we
 use
 ALJ
 SDK
 for
 Nex
 that
 provides


a
 middleware


>> um


>> not
 the
 right
 one.
 One
 second


>> and
 a
 wrapper
 uh
 for
 our
 routes.


>> You
 will
 see.


>> Sorry.
 One
 second.


>> Yeah,


>> I
 think
 it's
 that.
 Oh,
 it's
 complaining.


Sorry.
 Conflicts.


There
 we
 go.
 Okay,
 there
 we
 go.


>> Yeah,
 a
 huge
 change.
 It's
 intimidating


but
 it's
 because
 um
 it's
 dealing
 with


the
 connected
 account.
 I
 think
 uh
 we
 are


in
 the
 process
 of
 simplifying
 that
 in


the
 SDK


>> way
 more.


>> Uh
 but
 yeah
 uh


>> what
 is
 this?


>> Uh
 so
 this
 is
 the
 next
 uh
 route
 for
 the


chat.


>> Yeah.
 So
 we've
 taken
 the
 page
 uh
 that


yeah
 has
 the
 the
 chat
 um
 client.
 Uh
 so


it's
 yeah
 it's
 just
 your
 your
 standard


NexJS
 page
 and
 um
 yeah
 this
 is
 our


wrapper
 [snorts]


um
 which
 then
 basically
 forces
 login
 um


or
 gives
 you
 a
 redirect.


>> Um
 yeah


>> let's
 step
 back
 a


>> yes


>> and
 I'm
 going
 to
 add
 authentication
 to


this
 agent.


>> Yes.


>> Okay.
 Where
 does
 this
 fit
 in?


>> This
 is
 an
 embedded
 agent
 within
 the


next
 app.
 So
 yes,
 this
 chatbot
 is
 an


embedded
 agent.
 Um
 we'll
 show
 other


>> I'll
 tell
 you
 what
 I'm
 agent
 do
 is


>> I
 have
 a
 existing
 deployment
 what


additional
 components
 you're
 sharing


with
 me
 right
 now.
 What's
 my
 existing


deployment?


>> Yeah.


>> And
 what's
 out
 of
 the
 box?


>> Yeah.
 So
 it's
 really
 these
 wrappers
 u


from
 the
 SDK
 which
 wrap
 an
 endpoint
 um


you
 know
 whether
 it's
 a
 page
 route
 or
 um


something
 else.
 Um
 so
 yeah
 and
 then
 this


is
 pretty
 standard
 with
 like
 our
 next.js


JS
 SDK
 now
 um
 we
 established
 a
 session


um
 so
 yeah
 I'll
 show
 login
 but
 that's


there's
 there's
 really
 not
 a
 lot
 of


magic
 here
 um
 we
 are
 however
 requesting


this
 new
 connected
 accounts
 to
 see
 if


you
 have
 a
 federated
 connection
 so


that's
 kind
 of
 the
 confusing
 part
 here


because
 like
 you
 know
 the
 old
 school


zero
 flows
 would
 not
 have
 that
 like
 you


know
 we
 we
 wouldn't
 be
 requesting


upstream
 providers
 in
 many
 cases
 or


other
 APIs
 Um
 but
 in
 this
 case
 yes
 we


are
 using
 a
 federated
 provider
 and
 um
 so


yeah
 it's
 it's
 a
 little
 more
 contrived
 I


guess
 um
 and
 yeah
 we're
 creating
 a


client
 there
 you
 can
 kind
 of
 see
 the


OIDC
 options
 we're
 providing
 which
 are


you
 know
 are
 specific
 for
 OIDC
 and
 then


um
 this
 connect
 account
 endpoint
 um
 is


is
 new
 that's
 going
 to
 enable
 our
 new


connected
 accounts
 API
 um
 for
 managing


all
 of
 your
 accounts
 Um


I
 think
 that's
 Yeah.
 So
 let
 me
 show
 that


and
 kind
 of
 Yeah,
 go
 for
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.


Um


>> so
 that
 was
 code.
 Um


I
 think


>> let
 me
 restart.


>> All
 right.
 Okay.
 Let's
 try
 it
 again.


>> Yeah.
 Run
 it.


>> No,
 it
 didn't.


>> It's
 it's
 it's
 there.


>> Awesome.


>> So
 I'm
 gonna
 sign
 out
 and
 sign
 in.


>> Yeah.
 So
 we
 sign
 out.
 Um
 so
 at
 this


point
 is
 up
 to
 you
 want
 to
 place
 a
 login


button
 or
 whatever
 login
 UX
 is
 suits


best
 with
 with
 you
 in
 this
 case
 just
 to


simplify
 if
 you
 try
 to
 access
 the
 URL
 it


will
 just
 prompt
 you
 with
 the
 login


screen
 right
 away.


>> Um
 so
 we
 log
 in
 now
 um
 at
 this
 point
 we


are


>> well
 we
 it
 doesn't
 show
 but
 we
 are


logging
 to
 the
 upstream
 ID.
 Yes.
 So


using
 just
 one
 credentials


and
 then
 [sighs and gasps]


uh
 well
 at
 least
 uh
 now


>> uh
 it
 knows
 that
 I've
 got
 a
 session
 uh


>> and
 who
 I
 am.


>> Let's
 see.


>> Yeah.


>> Awesome.
 So
 it
 got
 the
 profile
 from
 the


IDP.
 It
 load
 that
 to
 the
 context.
 Yeah.


So
 now
 it
 knows
 who
 we
 are.


>> Yeah.
 And
 in
 this
 fictitious
 application


like
 this
 is
 also
 the
 same
 identity


that's
 uh
 I'm
 sorry
 that's
 linked
 with


the
 the
 stock
 trader
 uh
 sorry


yeah
 this
 dashboard.
 So
 so
 yeah
 your


identities
 are
 now
 linked
 between
 you


know
 these
 applications
 you're
 using
 an


upstream
 provider
 and
 you'll
 also
 see


shortly
 that
 they'll
 be
 linked
 with
 your


MCP
 tools
 as
 well.
 So,
 okay.


So,
 we've
 got
 identity
 for
 we've
 got


login.
 Um,
 we've
 got
 an
 embedded
 agent


running
 locally.
 Um,


um,
 what
 else
 do
 we
 want
 to
 talk
 about


in
 this
 step?
 Are
 we
 ready
 to
 go
 on?


>> Okay.
 So,
 it
 knows
 who
 I
 am,
 but
 it


doesn't
 know
 what
 I
 own.
 What
 What
 is


that?
 It
 doesn't
 have
 access
 to
 the


trading
 service
 resources
 that
 I
 own
 in.


So
 if
 you
 go
 back
 to
 the


>> uh
 demonstrated
 app
 one
 sec.


>> Uh
 yeah
 this
 one.


>> Yes.
 So
 my
 balance
 is
 10k.


I've
 got
 these
 recent
 orders.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 so
 on
 so
 forth.
 So
 how
 can
 we
 give


the
 agent
 access
 to
 all
 this
 data?


>> Yeah.
 So
 all
 right.


>> So
 the
 first
 step
 is
 as
 we
 said
 earlier


>> we
 need
 to
 connect


the
 two
 accounts.
 So
 even
 if
 we
 are


using
 the
 same
 credentials,
 we
 still


didn't
 say
 explicitly
 or
 the
 a
 user


didn't
 set
 the
 explicitly
 to
 the
 agent,


hey
 I
 I
 know
 I
 I
 want
 you
 to
 know
 who
 I


am,
 but
 I
 didn't
 give
 you
 permissions
 to


access
 my
 account
 yet.
 So
 that's
 the


step
 you
 are
 doing.
 We
 are
 connected
 the


account.
 So
 that's
 when
 we
 prompt
 the


user
 with
 these
 extra
 permissions
 that


the
 agent
 needs,
 these
 extra
 scopes,


right?
 And
 that's
 when
 the
 relationships


is
 established.
 Uh
 so
 now
 the
 agent


knows
 that
 uh
 I
 have
 access
 to
 this


account


>> with
 that
 exact
 permissions.
 Nothing


more,
 nothing
 else.


>> Yeah.
 Yep.


And


>> yeah.


>> Yeah.
 So
 next
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 adding


some
 tools
 which
 can
 now
 leverage
 this


account.
 Um
 so
 I'm
 going
 to
 jump
 into


portfolio
 tools.


Um,
 and
 this
 is
 getting
 into
 that
 token


exchange
 and
 um,
 yeah,
 now
 we
 can
 start


to
 ask
 more
 pertinent
 queries,
 right?
 We


can
 say,
 can
 you
 view
 my
 portfolio?
 Um,


and
 uh,
 yeah,
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 give


you
 access
 yet
 to
 create
 orders.
 That'll


be
 uh,
 the
 next
 pieces.
 Um
 but
 yes
 uh


this
 kind
 of
 shows
 how
 our
 SDK
 kind
 of


models
 getting
 an
 access
 token
 for


another
 [snorts]
 connection
 upstream.
 Um


how
 to
 how
 to
 leverage
 shared
 tools
 and


TypeScript.
 Um
 I
 think
 what's
 really


nice
 here
 is
 that
 these
 tools
 can
 be


versatile.
 They
 can
 be
 shared
 between


whether
 it's
 an
 agent
 tool
 or
 an
 MCP


tool.
 Um
 hopefully
 your
 framework
 has


you
 know
 TypeScript
 support.
 Um
 that's


also
 a
 really
 nice
 uh
 capability


tool
 organization.
 Um
 so
 yeah
 let
 yeah


if
 you
 want
 to
 keep
 going
 I'm
 going
 to


add
 the
 the
 tools.


>> Awesome.
 So
 the
 same
 as
 the
 same
 the


first
 step
 we
 did
 we
 are
 going
 to
 load
 a


uh
 well
 to
 give
 the
 agent
 a
 new
 tool.
 So


far
 local
 tools
 we
 will
 get
 to
 we
 will


get
 to
 into
 the
 MCP
 part
 later
 but
 uh
 it


is
 a
 native
 tool
 that
 it
 does
 a
 simple


>> um
 HTTP
 request
 to
 the
 service
 but
 uh


the
 tool


will
 have
 a


>> so
 we
 can
 show
 yeah
 sorry


>> so
 one
 of
 the
 other
 things
 that
 we


provide
 in
 our
 SDKs
 is
 how
 we
 connect


this
 tool
 uh
 with
 the
 authentication


part
 and
 the
 authentication
 part.


>> Yeah.
 [snorts]


>> Use
 the
 the
 tools
 basically
 again.


>> Yeah.


>> So


>> So
 can
 you
 show


>> the
 code
 tool?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> No,
 the
 tool
 again
 the
 code
 tool.


>> Uh
 you
 show
 the


>> this
 one
 tools
 or


>> the
 the
 get
 portfolio
 tool.


>> Oh
 yeah.
 Go
 in


uh
 Yeah.


Sorry.


Yeah.


>> So
 at
 some
 point
 we
 have
 we
 create
 uh


with
 with
 a
 client
 and


in
 the
 handler.


>> Yeah.


>> What
 is
 that
 call?


>> So
 yeah
 it's
 just
 a
 a
 get
 with
 a
 include


history
 you
 know
 query
 pram
 option


optional
 uh
 addition
 there.
 um
 pretty


straightforward


API
 call
 once
 you
 have
 a
 client
 and
 a


token.
 Um
 but
 yeah,
 this
 the
 sweet
 sauce


is
 the
 you
 know
 we
 can
 now
 leverage
 this


get
 access
 token
 for
 connection
 really


easily
 on
 our
 SDK.
 Um
 so
 yeah
 let
 me


show
 that
 if
 you
 want
 to


>> yeah
 it's
 everything
 is
 summarized
 on


this
 slide
 that's
 what
 I
 wanted
 to
 show.


Uh
 so
 our
 SDK
 provides
 this
 you
 provide


the
 connection
 in
 this
 case
 that's
 the


upstream
 name
 that
 is
 represented
 in
 in


your
 tenant


uh
 and
 that's
 what
 does
 all
 the
 dance


with
 the
 top


>> there
 I'll
 say
 can
 you
 show
 my
 portfolio


sorry


>> so
 yeah
 um
 all
 right


>> so
 we've
 got
 an
 agent
 with
 access
 to
 our


data
 now
 so
 he
 knows
 who
 I
 am
 but
 also


has
 access
 to
 what
 I
 am


has
 digital
 access.
 Well,
 it's
 up
 to
 you


obviously
 that
 the
 tool
 implemented
 but


at
 least
 yeah
 I already
 know
 exactly


what
 we
 have.


>> Okay.


>> Okay.


>> So,
 so
 we
 have
 portfolio
 tools
 uh
 which


is
 great.
 Um


I
 didn't
 show
 the
 scopes
 but
 [laughter]


uh
 yeah
 rest
 assured
 that
 like
 I
 must


show
 the
 MCP
 server
 really
 quickly.
 So


kind
 of
 what
 we've
 scaffolded
 and


modeled.
 Um
 and
 this
 may
 help
 with
 some


of
 the
 questions
 but
 the
 um
 yeah
 here's


the
 MCP
 server
 which
 we've
 we've
 modeled


as
 an
 API.
 Um
 and
 we
 have
 you
 know


scopes
 around
 accessing
 the
 MCP
 server.


um
 we've
 kind
 of
 modeled
 those
 the
 same


way
 as
 our
 as
 our
 upstream
 um
 API.
 So


let's
 see
 permissions.
 Um
 we've
 got


scopes
 around
 reading
 trades,
 reading


our
 portfolio.
 Um
 and
 yeah,
 those
 are


referenced
 in
 in
 those
 tools
 in
 the


meta.
 Um
 that
 wasn't
 abundantly
 clear,


but
 um
 yes,
 we
 are
 representing
 those
 as


like
 scoped
 permissions.
 Um


>> how
 do
 you
 create
 these
 permissions?


Yes.


>> The
 keyword
 trade
 and
 portfolio
 these


are
 very
 application
 specific.


>> Yes.


>> Yes.


>> Yes.


>> So
 how
 would
 it
 know
 what
 they
 are
 mean


in
 the
 context
 of
 the
 application?


>> You
 want
 to
 take
 that
 one?


>> What
 do
 you
 mean?


>> So
 this
 app
 is
 a
 stock
 trading
 app.
 So


the
 word
 trade
 and
 portfolio
 will
 have


very
 specific
 meaning
 here.


>> Yes.
 Yes.


>> But
 I
 could
 have
 another
 app
 where
 the


word
 trade
 or
 the
 word
 portfolio
 maybe


it's
 like
 a
 project
 management
 app.


Portfolio
 would
 mean
 something
 else.


>> Yeah.
 But


>> so
 so
 how
 does
 it
 identify


[snorts]
 the
 meaning
 of
 the
 permission?


>> That's
 taking
 it.


>> Yeah,
 I
 can.
 So
 uh
 yes,


>> I
 think
 I
 understand
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 is
 the
 upstream
 service
 that


sets
 the
 rules,
 right?
 [clears throat]


So
 [snorts]
 if
 you
 want
 to
 access
 my
 my


my
 resources,
 I
 need
 an
 access
 token


with
 this
 scope.
 Otherwise,
 I
 would


reject
 your
 request.


>> And
 it
 doesn't
 it
 doesn't
 matter
 if


you're
 an
 agent
 or
 even
 a
 just


traditional
 REST
 API
 client.
 And
 that


rel
 that
 you
 as
 an
 implementer
 of
 the


agent,
 you
 know
 that
 in
 advance.
 You


know
 if
 you
 are
 connected
 to
 an


upstream,
 you
 know
 what's
 the
 shape
 of


the
 request
 and
 what's
 the
 authorization


layer
 that
 I
 need
 to
 implement.
 You
 can


model
 your
 scopes
 as
 you
 want
 in
 your


local
 tenant
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


the
 translation
 the
 scopes
 to
 the


upstream
 should
 be
 done.
 So
 you
 can
 you


can
 tell


>> where
 do
 I
 do
 that?


>> It's
 in
 the
 connection.


>> Yeah.
 When
 you
 define
 the
 connection.


>> Yeah.


Yeah.
 So
 the
 the
 enterprise
 connection


here
 to
 our
 upstream
 is
 here.
 And
 yeah,


you
 can
 kind
 of
 see
 we're
 requesting


those
 scopes
 from
 the
 upstream
 tenant


and
 it
 also
 in
 this
 case
 like
 has
 those


scopes
 modeled
 around
 the
 stock
 API.
 So


>> exactly.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 these
 scopes
 I'm
 getting
 from
 that


from
 the
 from
 the
 service.


>> Yes.
 So
 this
 comes
 out
 most
 likely


publicly
 available
 or
 it's
 something


that
 is
 part
 of
 the
 contract
 between
 you


and
 the
 upstream


>> and
 that's
 exactly
 what
 the
 user
 will


see
 on
 on
 the
 prom
 that
 you
 saw
 at
 the


moment
 that
 they
 connect
 the
 account.


>> Exactly.


>> So
 we
 are
 here
 for
 to
 simplify
 we
 use


the
 same
 names
 but
 it
 could
 be
 different


it
 could
 be
 different
 scopes
 have
 it's


the
 translation
 happens
 on
 top
 of
 both.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 um
 yeah,
 I
 should
 also


worth
 mentioning
 like
 we
 model
 roles


differently,
 right?
 like
 around
 you
 know


personas
 or
 other
 identities
 scopes
 are


really
 around
 API
 access
 right
 so
 if


you're
 looking
 to
 kind
 of
 model
 more


around
 a
 role
 um
 yeah
 definitely
 check


out
 FDA
 um
 we
 have
 role
 based
 access


controls
 which
 you
 can
 apply
 around


tools
 as
 well
 or
 around
 pages
 but
 this


is
 more
 just
 you
 know
 fine
 grained
 uh


access
 around
 an
 API
 um
 so
 all
 right


let's
 keep
 going


>> and
 this
 is
 new


>> yes
 Yeah,
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 is
 very
 new.


>> Connections
 has
 been
 around
 for
 forever,


but
 the
 purpose
 and
 actually
 that's
 the


name
 we
 chose.
 Uh
 the
 purpose
 of
 a


connection


>> uh
 we
 create
 a
 new
 one
 which
 is
 talking


mode.


>> All right,
 we're
 still
 doing
 pretty
 good


on
 time,
 but
 yeah,
 it's
 okay.
 Ready
 to


jump
 in
 MCP.
 So


>> yes,
 um
 any
 questions
 so
 far?
 Kind
 of


switching
 topics
 here.
 I
 I
 wanted
 to
 ask


similar
 to
 your
 question


>> the
 scopes
 will
 be
 available
 you
 get


them
 from
 the
 well-known
 oids
 like
 a


hard


common
 way
 to
 get
 these
 right
 and
 you


can
 publicly
 fetch
 them
 and
 then


>> yes


>> yes yes


>> yes
 exactly
 um
 so
 yeah
 that's
 you've


jumped
 right
 into
 the
 next
 flow
 and


>> uh
 yeah
 so
 we
 are
 trying
 to
 implement


the
 current
 spec
 with
 MCP
 now
 and
 that's


kind
 of
 the
 next
 part
 of
 this
 exercise


is
 adding
 the
 well-known
 protected


resource
 metadata
 endpoint.
 Um
 and
 um


yeah,
 so
 we've
 been
 testing
 this
 with
 a


lot
 of
 providers
 uh
 recently
 and


recently
 we
 just
 EA
 our
 DCR
 uh
 feature


like
 this
 week.
 So
 um
 but
 yeah,
 that


this
 flow
 is
 a
 little
 more
 involved,


right?
 Because
 the
 the
 MCP
 server


becomes
 um
 you
 know
 a
 client
 of
 the


agent.
 Um
 and
 we're
 kind
 of
 we're
 going


to
 show
 kind
 of
 how
 we
 modeled
 that
 in


the
 Verscell
 code.
 Um
 [clears throat]


um
 and
 you
 can
 see
 like
 you
 know
 all
 of


the
 steps
 there's
 you
 know
 obviously


more
 involved
 but
 it's
 you
 know
 it's


important
 because
 we're
 actually


securing
 MCP
 resources
 and
 tools
 and


kind
 of
 doing
 it
 in
 a
 granular
 way
 but


also
 enabling
 dynamic
 registration


um
 with
 many
 providers.
 Um
 so
 yeah
 we'll


showcase
 that
 towards
 the
 end
 here.
 Um


yeah,
 I
 can
 probably
 fire
 this
 up
 if
 you


want.
 Um
 kind
 of
 see
 if
 there's
 So
 this


kind
 of
 show
 maybe
 I'll
 talk
 through
 a


little
 bit
 of
 this.
 This
 kind
 of
 shows


some
 of
 the
 middleware


um
 and
 how
 we
 apply
 like
 scope


verification
 on
 the
 MCP
 server
 itself


and
 how
 we
 expose
 metadata.
 So
 yeah,


that's
 exactly
 what
 you're
 alluding
 to


is
 like
 we
 we
 advertise
 the
 supported


scopes
 um
 when
 you
 go
 to
 register
 um
 in


that
 part
 of
 the
 flow
 and
 then


um
 yeah
 further
 down
 I
 think
 it's
 in
 the


transport
 when
 we
 actually
 construct


uh
 so
 yeah
 this
 is
 just
 more
 helpers
 so


it's
 like
 you
 know
 creating
 middleware


to
 verify
 a
 JWT
 we're
 still
 you
 know


still
 a
 beer
 token
 um
 public
 private
 key


encryption.
 Um
 but
 yeah,
 we
 we
 reference


those
 libraries.
 We
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 shared


libraries
 for
 doing
 these
 things
 now.
 Um


and
 then
 um
 yeah,
 it
 another
 important


mention
 here
 is
 this
 is
 where
 we


introduced
 this
 custom
 API
 client.
 Um


maybe
 I
 can
 show
 so
 this
 is
 a
 separate


client
 that
 we've
 modeled
 in
 this
 uh


demonstration.
 You
 could
 really
 create


any
 number
 of
 API
 clients
 if
 you
 want
 to


model
 them,
 you
 know,
 more
 independently


or
 how
 you
 want
 to
 build
 your
 stack.


But,
 um,
 yeah,
 we've
 modeled
 this
 as
 a
 a


linked
 client,
 which
 is
 also
 a
 new


feature,
 not
 zero.
 Um,
 so
 now
 we
 can


actually
 link
 APIs
 to
 clients
 and
 model


them
 as
 basically
 you
 can
 think
 of
 them


as,
 you
 know,
 an
 agent
 client
 or
 an
 MCP


server
 client.
 So,
 um,
 so
 that's
 a


really
 nice
 new
 feature.
 um
 those
 are


now
 linked
 and
 um
 we
 have
 API
 support


for
 those
 as
 well.
 Um
 so
 yeah
 you
 can


see
 like
 constructing
 an
 API
 client
 with


the
 MCP
 server
 client
 ID
 and
 secret.
 Um


and


yeah
 I'll
 run
 that
 in
 just
 a
 second.
 I


want
 to
 see
 if
 this
 so
 this
 is
 again


like
 monitoring
 these
 shared
 tools.
 So


we've
 we've
 taken
 this
 like
 stock
 tool


portfolio
 tool
 from
 the
 agent
 over
 to


the
 MCP
 server
 now.
 So
 we
 can
 expose
 it


from
 there
 as
 well.
 Um
 and
 then
 you
 know


the
 registration
 of
 the
 tools.


Um
 and
 then
 yeah
 this
 is
 where
 we
 create


the
 transport
 right.
 So
 this
 is
 where
 we


create
 this
 MCP's
 endpoint
 and


construct
 the
 server
 and
 um
 yeah
 that


that's
 where
 we
 invoke
 our
 middleware


and
 so
 yeah
 let
 me
 show
 that
 and
 um
 yeah


if
 you
 want
 to
 add
 anything
 else
 feel


free


>> yeah
 so
 in
 in
 this
 case
 to
 an
 attempt
 to


to
 show
 the
 whole
 journey
 we
 decided
 to


create
 the
 NCP
 as
 part
 of
 this
 workshop


>> but
 it
 could
 also
 be
 that
 you


>> get
 your
 upstream
 NCP
 not
 that
 you
 are


building
 an
 NCP
 but
 you
 still
 need
 to


authorize
 to
 that
 right
 so
 in
 in
 in
 both


cases
 association
 works


>> so
 it's
 not
 that
 we
 wanted
 to
 show
 both


ends
 uh
 so
 that's
 why
 there's
 so
 many
 so


so
 much
 code
 in
 in
 that
 page
 it's
 just


because
 uh
 part
 of
 it
 is
 is
 the
 actual


MCP
 server


>> so
 I've
 unstashed
 all
 the
 changes
 in


this
 that
 I
 just
 showed
 and
 Um
 yes
 like


this
 is
 basically
 uh
 what's
 going
 to


give
 us
 the
 MCP
 tools.
 Um
 so
 um
 yeah
 I


will
 start
 this.
 [snorts]


All right.
 Um


so
 yeah
 we
 made
 the
 changes
 to
 the


client.
 So
 in
 this
 case
 in
 this
 the
 same


nextGS
 server
 that
 the
 agent
 is
 running


is
 where
 the
 MCP
 is
 served.
 But
 it's
 up


to
 you
 which
 as
 your
 architecture
 but


same
 same
 concept
 apply.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I'm
 gonna
 say


>> yes
 go.
 Yeah.


>> So
 if
 you
 go
 back
 to
 the
 chat
 UI,
 can


you
 can
 [clears throat]
 you
 do
 a
 prompt


injection
 to
 tell
 that
 now
 my
 connection


have
 a
 different
 scope
 and


>> so
 you
 can
 try
 that
 but
 it
 will
 take
 a


no
 effect
 because
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 are


asking
 scopes
 that
 are
 not
 part
 of
 the


connection
 would
 be
 either
 ignored
 or


rejected.


>> So
 so
 basically
 just
 ignore
 that.
 Yeah,


it
 depends
 on
 the
 the
 upstream,
 but


yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 the
 scopes
 that
 are
 not
 part,


correct
 me
 if
 I'm
 wrong,
 Patrick,
 but


scopes
 that
 are
 not
 part
 of
 the


connection
 can
 never


>> end
 up
 in
 the
 access
 token.


>> That's
 correct.
 That's
 right.


>> Right.
 So,
 I
 think
 our
 policy
 most
 of


the
 times
 is
 just
 ignore
 what
 we
 don't


recognize.


>> So,
 you
 just
 you
 will
 get
 an
 access


token
 with
 valid
 scopes,
 but
 not
 the
 one


you
 try
 to
 inject.


Okay.


>> And
 also
 I
 don't
 think
 now
 that
 you


mentioned
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 expose


the
 out
 part
 to
 the
 LM
 meaning
 we
 expose


the
 tool
 and
 we
 grab
 the
 tool
 but
 the


authorization
 happened
 before
 the
 tool


execution.


So
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 LM
 will
 have
 any


influence
 in
 what
 exactly.
 But
 I'm
 not


saying
 it's
 not
 possible
 because
 there


[laughter]
 are
 many
 ways
 to
 do
 many


things.


But
 either
 way,
 even
 in
 our
 end,


>> anything
 that
 we
 don't
 recognize


shouldn't
 end
 up
 in
 an
 access
 token.


>> Because
 you
 mean
 that
 the
 OP
 will


actually
 recognize
 what
 connections
 you


have
 before
 it
 pass
 your
 instruction


over
 to
 LM
 to
 execute.
 Is
 that
 right?


>> Yes.
 So
 you
 when
 you
 go Jio
 try
 to


execute
 the
 tool.
 So
 the
 tool
 will
 say


okay
 I
 need
 an
 access
 token
 because
 I


need
 to
 do
 an
 API
 call.
 So
 it's
 our


grapper
 or
 our
 SDK
 tools
 that
 provide


this
 access
 token
 to
 the
 tool.
 It's
 not


the
 tool
 on
 command
 to
 the
 end
 the
 to


from
 the
 LLM
 that
 runs
 the
 authorization


request.
 It's
 it's
 let
 me
 say
 it's
 just


oldfashioned


code.
 It's
 not
 LLM
 code.


>> Okay.
 So
 uh
 now
 I'm
 going
 to
 show
 kind


of
 step
 for
 step
 the
 DCR.
 Um
 so
 yeah


it's
 our
 I'm
 using
 MCP
 inspector
 and


common
 tool.
 Um
 and
 we'll
 show
 some


others
 but
 um
 yeah
 this
 will
 kind
 of


just
 show
 now
 we
 can
 actually
 target


that
 MCP
 server
 directly
 you
 know


running
 on
 the
 same
 server
 under
 /mcp


now.
 Um
 so
 yeah
 and
 this
 will
 show
 our
 o


flow
 and
 DCR
 happening.
 So
 I'm
 going
 to


hit
 continue.


disclaimer,
 open
 DCR
 is
 a
 thing.
 Yeah.


>> But
 in
 as
 in
 early
 access
 and
 I
 don't


think
 we
 will


>> Yeah.


>> There
 are
 some
 concerns
 about
 how
 this


will
 scale.


>> Yes.


>> Um
 but
 there
 are
 other
 aspects
 coming
 uh


that
 I
 think
 fit
 better
 in


>> in
 this
 scenario.


>> Absolutely.
 I
 agree.


Uh
 but
 yeah,
 you
 can
 see
 the
 protected


resource
 metadata
 coming
 back.
 So
 we


have
 the
 well-known
 endpoint.
 Um
 you
 can


see
 the
 scope
 supported
 and
 then
 we
 make


a
 request
 to
 the
 authorization
 server.


Um
 that
 returns
 more
 information
 about


our
 tenant.
 Um
 and
 you
 know
 additional


scopes
 how
 to
 authorize.
 Um
 so
 yeah,
 I'm


going
 to
 jump
 through
 that.
 And
 then
 we


get
 a
 registration
 call.
 Um,
 so
 now


we're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 new
 client
 just
 for


testing
 purposes
 with
 the
 MCP
 server.


Um,
 so
 yeah,
 now
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 um


believe
 this
 is
 PKCE.
 It's
 our


authorization
 code
 flow
 with
 proof
 key


code
 exchange.
 Um,
 so
 yeah,
 it's


standard
 on
 zero
 flow,
 but
 it's
 also


works
 well
 with
 with
 MCP.
 Um,
 so
 I'm


going
 to
 copy
 this.


Uh,


okay.
 So,
 yeah,
 now
 it's
 going
 to
 prompt


me
 and
 give
 me
 an
 authorization
 code.


And
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 line
 here,
 we


should
 get
 an
 access
 token.
 So,
 which
 is


great.
 So
 now
 we
 can
 access
 the
 MCP


server
 with
 these
 scopes
 from
 from


anywhere,
 right?
 That's
 the
 great
 thing.


So
 uh
 so
 now
 I'm
 going
 to
 hit
 connect


and
 let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 some
 tools.


Uh
 yeah.
 So


yes,
 so
 now
 we
 have
 access
 to
 our


portfolio
 and
 um
 you
 know
 our
 our


identity
 tools
 kind
 of
 accessing
 um
 the


same
 upstream
 stock
 API.
 Um,
 so
 yeah.


Um,


you
 want
 to
 add
 anything
 here,
 Carlos,


before
 we
 go
 further?
 Oh,
 any
 question?


Yeah.


>> Sorry,
 I'll
 ask
 at
 the
 end.
 Yeah.


>> Sure.
 All right.


Okay.
 So,
 um,
 yeah,
 this
 is
 really
 the


most
 involved
 part
 of
 this
 flow.
 Um
 I'm


going
 to
 show
 the
 claude.
 Uh
 so
 I've


actually
 deployed
 it
 if
 you
 want
 to
 play


around.


Uh


and
 um
 yeah,
 so
 um
 that's
 that's
 really


the
 most
 involved
 part
 with
 MCPA
 rather.


Um
 um
 yeah,
 I
 think
 we're
 hitting
 time.


So
 let's
 go
 into
 the
 async
 goth.
 That's


all
 right.


>> All
 right.
 Okay.


Um


>> go
 for
 it.


Do
 you
 mind
 still
 um
 driving
 the
 the


coding
 so
 I
 can


>> All right.
 So
 we
 said
 that
 earlier
 the


fact
 that
 the
 agent
 has
 access
 to
 our


resources
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 you


should
 do
 anything
 in
 any
 time
 without


my
 supervision.
 Right?


I
 said
 this
 all
 the
 time.
 We
 don't
 want


an
 hallucinating
 agent
 buying
 a
 stock
 in


the
 middle
 of
 the
 night
 without
 my


permission.


>> What's
 wrong
 with
 that?
 [laughter]


>> Yeah.
 So
 that's
 where


part
 of
 our
 uh
 the
 bundle
 is
 provide
 a


simple
 way
 and
 a
 seamless
 way
 to
 the


agent
 to
 reach
 out
 the
 user
 and
 get


their
 approval
 for
 risky
 operation.


In
 this
 case,
 we
 consider
 place
 an
 order


either
 buy
 or
 sell
 a
 risky
 operation.


It's
 something
 that
 we
 as
 a
 developers


of
 the
 agent
 define.
 It's
 up
 to
 us.
 Um


so
 in
 this
 case
 what
 we
 are
 going
 to
 do


is
 we
 are
 we
 will
 bring
 um
 the
 create


order
 tool
 but
 with
 some
 conditions.


>> Yes.
 So
 D
 conditions
 would
 be
 that


before
 running
 the
 create
 order
 tool
 we


will
 call
 uh
 back
 channel
 O
 that's
 the


the
 SDK
 name
 for
 for
 the
 O
 uh
 sync


>> we
 will
 obtain
 an
 access
 token
 that


contains
 exactly
 what
 the
 user
 is
 so
 let


me
 let
 me
 go
 step
 uh
 backward
 so
 we
 will


create
 this
 request
 to
 back
 channel
 with


the
 detail
 with
 the
 details
 of
 the


transaction
 in
 this
 case
 it
 will
 be


exactly


the
 symbol
 I'm
 I'm
 buying
 or
 selling


quantity
 and
 the
 price
 for
 the
 user
 to


see
 that
 in
 their
 screen
 most
 likely
 out


of
 plan
 device
 see
 that
 and
 approve
 that


and
 only
 when
 that
 is
 approved
 we
 will


place
 the
 order.


>> Yeah.


Yeah.
 for
 that
 in
 this
 in
 this
 case
 in


this
 sample
 we
 will
 use
 guardian
 is
 our


uh
 mfa
 uh
 application
 is
 is
 out
 of
 the


box
 application
 you
 can
 use
 you
 can


install
 and
 use
 um
 but
 also
 we
 support


guardian
 SDK
 in
 case
 you
 want
 to


implement
 your
 own


>> um


>> I'll
 show
 the
 user


>> yeah
 so


to


for
 the
 agent
 to
 be
 able
 to
 reach
 out


the
 user
 in
 for
 this
 channel
 in


particular,
 the
 user
 needs
 to
 be


enrolled
 on
 MFA.


>> There
 are
 several
 mechanisms
 to
 do
 that


uh
 just
 for
 for
 for
 the
 workshop.
 We


show
 you
 kind
 of
 the
 back
 door
 of
 it,


>> but
 it
 depends
 on
 the
 UIX
 how
 you
 it


could
 be
 in
 sign
 up.
 It
 could
 be
 like
 a


step
 up
 kind
 of
 thing.
 I
 don't
 know.


It's
 up
 to
 uh
 to
 you.
 But
 we
 need
 to
 to


enroll.
 So
 you
 will
 find
 this
 is
 in
 the


docs
 but
 you
 will
 find
 a
 way
 to
 send
 an


email
 that
 contains
 all
 the
 instructions


to
 enroll.


>> So
 once
 we
 enroll
 we
 will
 we
 can
 we
 can


add
 this
 uh
 little
 helper
 here


>> uh
 that
 just
 basically
 forwards
 the
 uh


off
 to
 the
 to
 our
 SDK.


>> All
 right,
 let
 me
 undo
 and
 reapply
 here.


>> Yeah.
 Am
 I
 going
 faster
 than
 you?


>> No,
 it's
 Yeah,
 it's
 [laughter]
 perfect.


Sorry.


>> Catching
 up.


>> All right.
 Um


>> uh
 one
 sec.


>> Okay.
 So
 in
 a
 second
 I
 will
 show
 you


exactly
 what
 we
 are
 going
 to
 send
 in


this
 authorization.


>> Um


>> so
 we
 can
 see


>> so
 I
 think
 it
 was
 in
 a
 zero
 we
 add
 the


>> yeah
 so
 here
 is
 the
 uh
 this


>> is
 the
 helper.
 It's
 just
 a
 wrapper
 just


for
 wrap
 the
 errors
 and
 I'll
 test
 it.


But
 basically
 it's
 again
 this
 this
 line


of
 code
 in
 our
 SDK
 is
 what
 we
 sent
 and


what
 will
 run
 all
 these
 steps


>> internally.


>> Show
 the
 tool.


>> It
 will
 keep
 um
 it
 will
 wait
 for
 the


user
 response.
 So
 it's
 basically
 an
 an


sync
 uh
 operation
 and
 when
 the
 user


responds
 the
 agent
 can
 resume.
 Oh,


sorry.
 It's
 in
 uh
 it's
 in
 tools.
 This


one.


>> Uh
 yeah,
 this
 one.


>> So,
 yeah.
 So,
 here
 [clears throat]
 we


>> we're
 creating
 a
 new
 client
 with
 uh
 you


know,
 so
 we're
 specifying
 like
 what
 we


need
 in
 the
 authorization
 details.
 So,


we
 can
 provide
 that
 rich
 authorization


request
 detail
 when
 the
 authorization


request
 comes
 in.
 um
 we're
 you
 know


we're
 using
 this
 custom
 API
 client
 in


this
 case
 that
 we've
 already
 created
 you


could
 create
 others
 but
 yes
 we're


creating
 a
 custom
 API
 client
 to
 then


perform
 the
 back
 channel
 request
 um
 and


then
 uh
 yeah
 it
 in
 this
 case
 it
 waits


you
 could
 do
 a
 number
 of
 things
 you


could
 pull
 you
 could


there's
 other
 mechanisms
 here
 but
 yes
 in


this
 case
 for
 simplicity
 sake
 we
 wait


for
 the
 verification
 so
 let
 me
 give
 this


a


All
 right.


>> Yeah.
 [snorts]


So,


>> okay.
 So,
 we
 run
 the
 client
 again.
 Uh,


sorry,
 the
 chat
 box
 agent.


>> So,
 we'll
 go
 back
 to
 here.


>> All
 right.


>> And


so,
 now
 we
 can
 ask
 to


>> I
 don't
 know
 place
 an
 order


>> of
 what
 is
 it?
 Wayne.


>> Wayne.
 Yeah.
 For example,


>> fictitious
 stocks.


>> Yeah.
 So
 in
 this
 case,


>> yeah,
 go
 ahead.


>> I
 have
 this
 question
 about
 the
 code.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 all
 this
 code
 is
 checked


in.


>> I'm
 not
 sure.
 Do
 you
 have
 branches?


>> Uh
 yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Uh
 yes,
 I'm
 happy
 to


share
 that
 towards
 uh
 towards
 the
 Do
 you


want
 me
 to
 share
 it
 now
 or


>> later?
 I
 just
 follow
 Yes,
 we
 do
 have
 a


final
 state
 branch.
 Yes.


>> Um
 in
 this
 case,
 the
 agent
 is
 instructed


to
 inform
 the
 user
 that
 this
 is
 going
 to


happen.
 So
 this
 is
 not
 yet
 the


authorization
 request.
 is
 just
 heads
 up


that
 hey
 you're
 going
 to
 receive
 a
 push


notification


is
 is
 okay
 it's
 just
 a
 really
 silly


system


um
 so
 you
 can
 proceed
 then


>> yeah
 waiting
 hang
 on


>> um


one
 minute
 here
 should
 be
 connected


let's
 see


>> one
 a
 minute


>> you
 run
 this
 like
 [laughter]


Uh,


turn
 that
 off.
 Oh,
 because
 you're
 hot.


>> And
 [sighs]


let's
 see.


Let
 me
 try
 again.
 Let's
 see.


>> Yeah.
 Refresh
 and
 try
 again.


>> Refresh.


[clears throat]


>> Apart
 from
 push
 notifications,
 we
 also


support
 email
 as
 a
 random
 note.
 Um,
 and


more
 channels.
 We
 we
 will
 be


implementing
 more
 channels
 to
 reach
 out


there.


Yeah,
 maybe
 I
 need
 to
 restart
 the


application
 server


is
 if
 I
 have


>> can
 I
 just
 pre-authorize
 certain
 users


>> in
 in
 your
 engine
 like


>> yeah
 I
 I
 mean
 I
 guess
 it's
 up
 to
 you
 how


you
 manage
 this
 session
 with
 your
 agent


this


>> no
 yeah
 I
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 no
 one
 else


can
 engage
 like


>> with
 the
 same
 agent
 You
 mean?


>> Yeah.
 Or
 like
 can
 I
 can
 I
 get
 can
 I
 can


I
 be able
 to
 pre-authorize
 the
 agent
 for


certain
 access
 but
 also
 for
 preauthorize


who
 can
 use
 the
 agent
 for
 access.


>> Just
 trying
 to
 understand
 what
 are
 the


different
 use
 cases
 around
 that.


>> Um
 yeah
 but
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 up
 to
 you


how
 you
 kind
 of
 the
 how
 you
 manage
 your


sessions
 and
 permissions
 to
 access
 the


app
 as
 a
 resource.


>> Okay.
 Uh
 but
 once
 you
 establish
 that


it's
 just
 you
 can
 you
 can
 establish
 any


policy
 that
 you
 want
 at
 the
 end.
 I
 don't


I
 don't
 know
 if
 I'm
 following
 the
 we
 can


we
 can
 chat
 later
 but


>> I
 approved
 it.
 So
 yeah
 I
 had
 to


reconnect
 here
 on
 this
 network.
 So


>> okay


>> uh
 let
 me
 try
 one
 more
 time.


>> It
 did
 come
 in


>> in
 this
 example
 for
 this
 agent.
 It's


saying
 okay
 basically
 the
 we
 the
 agent


is
 asking
 if
 if
 it's
 allowed
 to
 go
 to


that
 website.
 So
 I
 just
 want
 to
 make


sure
 that
 the
 the
 agent
 is
 filled
 with


that
 website
 but
 no
 other
 websites.


That's
 what
 I
 meant
 about
 pre


authentication
 authorization.
 But
 when


you
 say
 website,
 you
 say
 the
 the
 service


>> or
 certain
 APIs
 or
 certain
 tools


just
 trying
 to
 see
 what
 if
 anything
 can


be
 done
 as
 it
 because
 right
 now
 the


application
 is
 happening
 as
 interactive.


>> Yes.


>> So
 I'm
 just
 saying
 can
 it
 be
 enough?


>> Okay.
 I
 see.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 So


>> this
 is
 how
 I
 I
 see
 I
 not
 access
 person.


>> No
 no
 I
 understand
 I
 understand
 now.
 I


understand
 now.
 So
 yeah,
 I
 I
 had
 similar


concerns.
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 in
 product,
 sorry.


But
 um
 yeah,
 so
 imagine
 that
 your


interface
 is
 not
 a
 chat
 box.


>> It's
 like
 a
 task
 runner
 kind
 of
 thing.


>> Exactly.


>> So
 I
 guess
 in
 what
 I
 would
 implement
 as


an
 engineer
 is
 I
 would
 attach
 my


identity
 or
 at least
 an
 identifier
 of


the
 user,
 the
 subject
 to
 that
 task
 in
 my


database.
 So
 I
 I
 enter
 the
 agent,
 I
 set


up
 a
 task
 and
 I
 say,
 "Okay,
 I
 want
 to
 I


don't
 know,
 find
 me
 a
 good
 deal
 or
 or


advise
 me
 or
 buy
 Wayne
 stocks
 when
 it's


below
 70."


>> It
 could
 be
 a
 task,
 right?
 I
 think
 that


task
 is
 modeled
 in
 your
 system,
 right?


It
 has
 to
 be
 modeled
 somehow.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 it's
 prompt
 and
 ID
 of
 the
 user


and
 that
 thing
 that's
 when
 you
 establish


that.
 And
 we
 use
 the
 user
 that
 is
 the


subject
 is
 what
 we
 use
 to
 identify
 if


the
 user
 has
 a
 connection
 to
 that


account


you
 know
 so
 I
 need
 this
 account
 this


user
 to
 have
 this
 connected
 this


>> I
 understand


>> and
 then
 I
 will
 only
 create
 a
 sensitive


identity
 for
 the
 agent
 because
 I
 want
 to


differentiate
 if
 the
 connection
 is


coming
 from
 an
 agent
 or
 coming
 from
 the


user


>> but
 that's
 that's
 the
 thing
 you
 are
 in


in
 our
 uh
 because
 the
 event
 is
 an
 agent


performing
 the
 the
 the
 request
 to
 the


service


>> behalf


>> is
 in
 my
 behalf.
 what
 I
 need


>> but
 I
 want
 to
 know
 but
 but
 I
 want
 to


differentiate
 though


>> because
 if
 an
 agent
 goes
 wrong
 I
 want
 to


know
 the
 agent
 goes
 wrong
 right
 so
 I


want
 to
 know


>> yeah
 you
 can
 you
 can


>> yes
 so
 in
 that
 case
 because
 the
 agent
 is


the
 client
 your
 access
 token
 will
 have


an
 author
 authorizing
 party
 that's
 a


claim
 identify
 not
 not
 the
 user
 but
 who


is


who
 the
 user
 is
 delegating
 the
 access
 to


>> and
 that's
 where
 you
 can
 say
 okay
 This


is
 my
 ID
 as
 an
 agent.
 This
 is
 my


subject.
 So
 I
 can
 know
 exactly
 okay
 this


agent
 is
 acting
 on
 behalf
 of
 this
 user


and
 you
 can
 ruin
 any
 policy
 on
 that
 that


you
 need.


>> Yeah.


>> That's
 all
 that's
 nothing
 new.
 It's
 been


it's
 been
 around
 forever.


>> No,
 but
 now
 I
 understand.
 I
 understand.


Yes.


So
 um
 yeah
 I
 wanted
 to
 show
 kind
 of
 logs


and
 also
 just
 uh
 we
 did
 show
 the


exchange
 in
 the
 last
 example
 for


accessing
 the
 portfolio
 but
 this
 is
 the


actual
 async
 siba
 exchange
 uh
 which
 is


slightly
 different
 in
 our
 logs
 but
 I


think
 it
 also
 kind
 of
 ties
 it
 together


really
 well.
 Um
 and
 it
 shows
 you
 know


I'm
 going
 to
 show
 like
 what
 an
 actual


token
 payloaded
 looks
 like.
 again


fictitious
 and
 these
 tokens
 are


>> not
 going
 to
 give
 you
 much.
 [laughter]


>> So
 this
 is
 the
 details
 I
 was
 talking


about.
 Um
 we
 use
 an
 extension
 of
 it's


reach
 authorization
 request
 is
 a
 it's
 in


a
 specification
 and
 basically
 we
 can


describe
 exactly
 what
 the
 user
 is
 giving


consent
 to.


>> Yeah.
 uh
 and
 that
 gets
 recorded
 in
 the


accessory.


In
 a
 real
 scenario,
 most
 likely
 the


resource
 server
 will
 want
 to
 verify


that.


>> Uh
 but
 yeah,
 that
 that's
 up
 to
 the
 the


stack
 that
 out
 of
 our
 but
 yeah,


>> I'll
 show
 the
 uh
 notification
 to
 so


yeah,
 it
 looks
 like
 so
 yeah,
 that's
 what


it
 looked
 like
 on
 my
 phone
 actually
 when


I
 actually
 connected
 it
 to
 the
 network


and
 I
 got
 a
 slew
 of
 notifications.


One
 of
 the
 challenges
 with
 uh
 rich


associations
 request
 is
 that
 the
 object


is
 reported.
 You
 can
 put
 anything
 you


want.
 Um
 and
 that
 complicates
 thing
 in


terms
 of
 rendering
 that
 request.
 To


solve
 that,
 we
 created
 an
 schema.
 Uh
 so


we
 we
 support
 an
 on
 schema.
 is
 flexible


enough
 to
 give
 you
 any
 opportunity
 to


display
 anything
 but
 is
 known
 and
 we
 can


it
 helps
 for
 our
 [snorts]
 app
 in
 our


case
 but
 also
 in
 your
 apps
 if
 you
 are


developing
 yours
 to
 to
 render
 this


dynamically.
 So
 our
 garden
 app
 is
 able


to
 render
 any
 details
 um
 and
 yeah
 we


provide
 this
 schema
 for
 you.
 All
 right,


>> cool.
 We're
 good.


>> All right.


>> Awesome.
 So,
 that's
 a
 little
 bit
 about


our
 new
 asynchronous
 authorization


features.
 Um,


last
 piece
 and
 then
 kind
 of
 open
 up
 more


for
 discussion
 and
 yeah,
 I
 know
 we'll


have
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 time,
 but
 um
 I
 just


want
 to
 quickly
 show
 and
 kind
 of
 preface


with
 like
 some
 of
 the
 integrations
 which


we
 are
 testing.
 This
 is
 very
 beta
 and


shipped
 very
 recently.
 But
 um
 yeah,
 this


is
 using
 that
 DCR
 flow.
 Um
 I'm
 kind
 of


showing
 how
 again
 how
 we
 did
 it
 with
 um


with
 the
 inspector,
 but
 also
 with
 cloud


code
 or
 with
 uh
 the
 chat
 uh
 I'm
 sorry,


the
 open
 API
 app
 SDK.
 Um
 so
 this
 just


kind
 of
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 do
 this
 now.


We're
 short
 on
 time,
 but
 obviously
 like


we
 can
 you
 know
 we
 can
 deploy
 this
 to


Burcell.
 Um
 I'm
 using
 an
 upstach


database
 uh
 varus
 database
 for
 handling


the
 state
 um
 on
 on
 the
 MCP
 server
 side.


Um


and
 yeah
 you
 you
 can
 get
 running
 pretty


quickly
 on
 on
 versell.
 So
 you
 can
 you


know
 you
 can
 take
 this
 agent
 and
 this


MCP
 server
 and
 start
 sharing
 you
 know


these
 tools.
 Uh
 bring
 your
 tools
 right


anywhere.
 So
 um


um
 yeah.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 show
 um
 I


guess
 just
 I've
 got
 a
 deployment
 that
 I


mentioned
 earlier.
 I'll
 target
 that
 and


uh
 I'll
 I'll
 DCR
 with
 my
 deployment.


Ironically,
 it's
 also
 linked
 to
 the
 same


identity
 provider.
 So,
 I'll
 get
 back
 my


same
 information.
 Um
 which
 is
 nice.
 Uh


and
 then
 um
 I'll
 show
 kind
 of
 how
 um
 in


cloud
 code
 this
 works.
 Um
 I'm
 going
 to


skip
 over
 chat
 uh
 GPT
 app
 SDK.
 There
 is


there
 is
 an
 integration
 that
 is
 starting


to
 work
 here.


Um
 there's
 some
 configurations
 needed.


So
 reach
 out
 and
 let's
 talk
 uh
 if
 you


need
 this
 today.
 Um
 but
 yeah,
 it'll
 be


pretty
 much
 readily
 available
 in
 you


know
 the
 very
 near
 future.
 So
 we
 we
 do


have
 some
 integrations
 today
 um
 that


we've
 we've
 tested.
 Um
 but
 yes,
 there's


this
 kind
 of
 gives
 you
 a
 rough
 overview


of
 like
 how
 you
 could
 quickly
 bring


those
 tools
 to
 J
 GPT.
 Um
 um


so
 yeah,
 I'm
 gonna
 gloss
 through
 that.


This
 is
 just
 me
 showing
 like
 oh
 yes,


I've
 connected
 it
 in
 GPT
 and
 I
 can


access
 my
 tools
 there.
 Um


um
 yeah,
 let
 me
 go
 ahead
 and
 while
 if


you
 want
 to
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of


that,
 I
 will
 show
 kind
 of
 uh
 getting
 a


new
 a
 new
 client
 with
 the
 with
 my


deployed
 instance
 and
 then
 integrating


it
 in
 cloud
 code.
 [snorts]


So
 yeah,
 just
 this
 is
 just
 to
 showcase


that
 the
 the
 client
 the
 MCP
 client


should
 also
 run
 the
 same
 policies
 all


policies
 that
 so
 all
 clients
 should
 run


the
 same
 uh
 so
 should
 identify


authenticate
 me
 and
 author
 and
 the


authorization
 the
 same
 authorization


policy
 should
 happen.
 So
 in
 this
 case
 um


we
 embedded
 the
 MCP
 as
 part
 of
 the


server
 but
 um


well
 in
 this
 case
 Patrick
 deployed
 that


for
 us.
 [laughter]


>> Uh
 so
 yeah


>> disconnect


>> same
 same
 thing
 we
 did
 before


um


in
 this
 case
 this
 is
 an
 production


issue.


>> Yeah
 same
 [snorts]


>> as
 you
 can
 see
 it's
 asking
 for
 my


authentication.


>> Okay.
 and
 it
 got
 an
 access
 token
 with


the
 scopes
 that
 we
 requested.


>> All
 right.
 So
 now
 we're
 going
 to
 pull
 up


claude


>> and
 uh


>> and
 yeah,
 we
 can
 just
 jump
 into


uh
 cloud
 cut
 uh
 give
 it
 the
 MCP.


>> So
 yep,


I
 got
 a
 command
 in
 the
 read
 me
 here


that's
 in
 the
 final.


>> All
 right.


>> So
 uh
 and
 then
 yeah,
 I
 need
 to
 replace


the
 token.
 I'll
 save.
 So
 in
 this
 case,
 I


am
 going
 to
 use
 my
 inspectors
 token
 and


claude
 does
 support
 authentication.


However,
 there
 is
 an
 open
 issue
 right


now
 about
 specifying
 scopes.
 [laughter]


Uh
 so
 yeah,
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 use
 my


inspector's
 access
 token.
 Um
 but
 yeah,


you'll
 see
 you'll
 see
 that
 with
 Claude


and
 then
 Claude
 will
 still
 initiate.
 Let


me
 show
 that.
 Unfortunately,
 the
 spec
 is


pretty
 new


>> and
 not
 all
 the
 clients
 implemented
 the


same
 way.
 Um,


>> yeah.


>> So,
 yeah,
 that's
 um
 I
 expect
 that
 to


stabilize
 advantages.


>> There's
 no
 like
 copy
 in
 this
 tool,
 is


there?


>> No.
 Okay.


Okay.


Once
 again,
 my
 my
 token
 is
 not
 going
 to


do
 you
 much.
 These
 are
 fictitious
 uh


trains.


>> All right.


>> Okay.


>> So,
 yeah,
 same
 same
 thing
 as
 before.
 We


can
 start
 asking
 about


>> what
 we
 got
 in
 the
 in
 the
 app
 service.


>> Uh
 what
 happened?


>> It's
 connected.


>> Is
 it
 connected?
 Okay.
 Oh,
 okay.
 So,
 let


me
 res
 sometimes
 I
 have
 to
 restart
 it.
 I


don't
 know
 why.
 Okay.
 Now,
 let's
 see.


No.
 Huh.


Yeah.
 Let
 me
 try
 once
 more
 here.


That
 did
 not
 work.
 I'm
 sure.
 Yeah,
 I'm


not
 seeing
 it.


Okay.


Clawed
 ad.


Yeah,
 it
 looked
 like
 it
 was
 there.


Let's
 see.


[snorts]


In
 the
 meantime,
 more
 questions.


>> Yeah,
 [snorts]
 you
 had
 a
 question


before.


>> Uh,
 yeah,
 I
 I
 think
 I
 get
 the
 perview


when
 you're
 a
 zero
 customer.
 Maybe
 the


context
 here
 if
 you're
 building
 an
 app


for
 let's
 say
 your
 consumers
 or


something,
 then
 maybe
 this
 whole
 flow


will
 be
 applicable.


I'm
 thinking
 but
 if
 you
 are
 an
 octa
 uh


tenant
 you're
 using
 octa
 in
 your


workspace
 how
 do
 the
 two
 work
 together


or
 do
 is
 this
 thing
 also
 going
 to
 be


available
 on
 the
 opta
 side


>> no
 I
 think
 the
 idea
 that
 got
 me
 I'm


going
 to
 I
 don't
 know
 exactly
 so
 100%


but
 what
 I
 think
 it
 is
 is
 we
 are
 going


to
 create
 some
 sort
 of
 bridge
 um
 that


you
 can
 apply
 the
 the
 the
 same
 policies


as
 octa
 as
 an
 employee
 to
 agents


>> and
 restrict
 those
 accesses
 to
 those


services
 as
 you
 would
 do
 with
 that


employee
 that's
 where
 I
 is
 that
 your


question
 more
 or
 less


>> kind
 of
 yeah


>> but
 also
 how
 how
 the
 two
 systems
 are


going
 to
 work
 together
 because


>> this
 seems
 like
 a
 feature
 of
 zero
 which


is
 my
 understand


>> yeah
 it
 is
 it
 is
 a
 separate
 part
 but
 um


as
 far
 as
 I
 know


work
 together
 on
 on
 protests.


Um,
 but
 yeah,
 we
 can
 we
 can
 connect


later
 if
 you
 want.
 I
 can
 dig
 into
 dogs.


Yeah,
 most
 likely
 us.


Yeah.
 Not
 sure
 what
 I'm
 doing
 wrong


here.
 Uh,
 do
 you
 need
 to
 do
 the


>> uh
 let's
 see


>> this
 this
 cloud
 command
 you
 don't
 you


have
 to
 run
 it
 outside
 cloud
 session


>> maybe


>> in
 the
 terminal.


>> Oh,
 in
 the
 terminal.
 Okay.
 Yeah,
 let's


try
 that.


>> Anything
 else?


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 so
 it
 seems
 like
 if
 I
 were


deploying
 an
 agent,
 one
 way
 I
 can
 start


is
 just
 to
 use
 the
 user's
 token
 on


behalf
 of
 who
 the
 agent
 is
 acting
 as
 the


token
 for
 the
 agent
 themselves.
 So
 what


do
 you
 feel
 like
 is
 the
 advantage
 of


existing
 agent
 identity?
 What
 are
 the


the
 features
 that
 have?


>> So
 when
 you
 say
 I
 can
 just
 pass
 so
 you


authenticate
 the
 user
 and
 just
 forward


the
 access
 token
 to
 the
 agent
 somehow
 or


>> that's
 that
 don't
 do
 that
 please.
 So
 the


access
 tokens
 are
 meant
 to
 first
 it
 will


be
 in
 terms
 of
 operability
 it
 will
 be


cumbersome
 because
 access
 tokens
 will


expire
 eventually.
 So
 at
 some
 point
 you


will
 need
 to
 reach
 out
 the
 user
 again


okay
 login
 and
 do
 all
 the
 dance
 again.


So
 how
 autonomous
 your
 agent
 will
 be
 in


that
 scenario.


Um
 so
 that's
 kind
 of
 what
 we
 try
 to


solve.
 So
 we
 establish
 that
 connection,


that
 relationship
 and
 we
 take
 care
 of


this
 nasty
 complex
 part
 of
 refreshing


tokens,
 storing
 tokens


um
 and
 and
 yeah
 all
 the
 scope
 step
 up


things
 like
 that.


>> Okay,
 so
 finally
 got
 it
 working
 here.


[laughter]


>> Some
 of
 the
 interactions
 I
 might
 make


with
 the
 agent
 are
 through
 say
 the
 the


chat
 assistant
 and
 so
 whenever
 the
 agent


is
 taking
 action,
 I'm


initiating
 an
 action,
 right?
 Or
 Not


necessarily
 as
 as
 for
 example
 the


example
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 before.


Imagine
 like
 a
 taskr
 runner
 kind
 of


thing.
 You
 log
 in,
 you
 have
 the


identity,
 you
 have
 a
 like
 a
 kind
 of


traditional
 dashboard
 where
 you
 list


your
 connectable
 apps,
 Slack,
 Gmail,
 uh


Google
 calendar,
 whatever.
 And
 the
 user


does
 that
 once,


just
 once.
 So
 once
 the
 these
 are


connected
 you
 can
 you
 give
 the
 Asian


client
 well
 not
 not
 double
 quot
 is
 the


Asian
 client


>> access
 to
 those
 apps.
 So
 every
 time
 so


the
 user
 next
 time
 that
 connects
 to
 the


chat
 that's
 it.
 You
 don't
 need
 to
 run


all
 this
 thing
 again.


>> It's
 it's
 already
 done.
 It's
 it's
 the


relationship
 has
 been
 established


already.
 So
 the
 user
 will
 open
 the
 chat


again.
 You
 don't
 need
 to
 do
 all
 this


connecting
 scopes,
 prompts,
 consent


screens.
 That's
 it.
 That's
 done.


Eventually,
 it
 can
 die.
 It
 depends
 on


the
 policy
 of
 your
 upstream.
 The
 refresh


tokens
 may
 expire.
 In
 that
 case,
 yes,


you
 will
 need
 to
 deal
 with,
 oh,
 you
 need


to
 reload
 again.
 You
 do
 that
 once
 and


that's
 it.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 just
 an
 update.
 Was
 they


finally
 able
 to
 have
 syntax
 or
 my


version
 of
 cloud,
 I
 guess.
 But
 um
 yeah


was
 able
 to
 off
 and
 kind
 of
 show
 went


through
 the
 authenticate
 screen
 and
 um


yeah
 now
 I
 can
 access
 my
 same
 tools
 in
 a


deployed
 instance.
 Um
 you
 can
 do
 this


with
 several
 providers
 now,
 right?
 Um


all
 of
 which


any
 which
 support
 uh
 D
 as
 as
 Carlos
 was


saying
 like
 any
 which
 support
 DCR
 static


client
 or
 preconfigured
 clients
 um
 and


then
 yeah
 soon
 to
 be
 client
 ID
 metadata


is
 the
 next
 uh
 spec
 I
 believe
 that's


going
 to
 be
 implemented.
 Um,
 so
 yeah,


you'll
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 options
 to
 to


register
 new
 clients,
 new
 agents,
 um,


and
 access
 your
 tools.
 Um,


uh,
 yeah,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 there's


anything
 else
 we
 turn
 back
 to.


>> Questions?


>> Okay,


>> I
 think
 that's
 it.
 Um,
 questions
 and


feedback,
 whatever.
 Um,
 please
 reach
 out


or


>> Yeah.
 I
 know
 I
 the
 guy
 I
 showed
 in
 your


workshop,
 but
 to
 his
 question,
 is
 there


a
 a
 later
 branch?


>> Yes.


>> Yes,
 absolutely.
 And
 let
 me
 push
 that
 to


his
 repository
 and
 let
 me
 show
 my
 final


state
 now.
 And
 yeah,
 I'll
 pull
 that
 up


and
 link
 it
 here.


>> Also,


the
 live
 demo
 and
 build


a
 lot


>> for
 the
 first
 time.
 Yeah,
 for
 the
 first


time
 with
 a
 major
 release
 this
 week
 was


like
 we
 just
 shipped
 this
 like
 two
 days


ago.
 So,
 but
 [snorts]
 yeah.


>> All
 right.
 Okay.


>> Uh
 but
 yeah,
 the
 final
 state
 is
 in
 my


branch
 here.
 Finish


finish
 state.
 Uh
 that
 should
 have
 all


the
 applied
 changes
 and
 I
 think
 I've


like
 tweaked
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 like
 order


history
 tools,
 but
 it's
 it's
 pretty


straightforward.
 Um
 there's
 some
 other


tools
 that
 are
 implemented
 there,
 but


yeah,
 it's
 it's
 up
 to
 you
 what
 you
 want


to
 implement
 there.
 Um
 but
 yeah,
 can
 I


let's
 see
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I
 can
 I
 can


link
 this
 in
 the
 notes
 after
 and
 um


>> we'll
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 have
 this
 uh


I'll
 probably
 actually
 push
 it
 to
 our


our
 upstream
 workshop
 branch.
 So,
 and


yeah,


>> just
 little
 disclaimer,
 the
 workshop


app,
 well,
 it
 can
 suffer
 some


disruptions
 uh
 as
 we
 uh
 develop
 more


things.
 So,
 yeah,
 take
 that
 into


consideration.


>> All
 right.


>> All
 right.
 Awesome.
 Thank
 you.
