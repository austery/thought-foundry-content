If
 you
 have
 really
 really
 high


ambitions,
 you
 achieve
 great
 things
 even


if
 you
 fail.
 If
 you
 have
 low
 ambitions,


you
 achieve
 nothing
 even
 if
 you
 succeed.


>> Where
 do
 you
 think
 the
 tech
 sector


evolves
 from
 here?


>> Well,
 that's
 the
 trillion
 dollar


question,
 right?


>> Luckily,
 you
 manage
 what,
 two
 trillion.


So,


>> when
 I
 give
 presentations
 at


universities,
 I
 I
 ask
 people,
 hey,


anybody
 here
 who
 thinks
 differently
 from


other
 people
 who
 kind
 of
 think
 that
 they


are
 weird,
 hands
 up.
 So,
 typically
 less


than
 10%.
 I
 said,
 you
 guys,
 you're


great.
 We'd
 love
 to
 hire
 you.
 And
 then


the
 other
 90%
 is
 like,
 you
 know,
 sorry


guys,
 you're
 just
 like
 everybody
 else.


You're
 never
 going
 to
 make
 much
 money.


Okay,
 so
 I
 never
 do
 politics
 because
 my


job
 is
 not
 is
 totally
 not
 political.
 But


if
 I
 were
 like
 uh
 prime
 minister
 for
 a


day,
 I
 would
 inject
 AI
 everywhere.
 If


you
 look
 at
 the
 golden
 ages
 we've
 had


and
 you
 look
 at,
 you
 know,
 the
 real


powers
 we've
 had
 during
 the
 years,
 you


know,
 Rome,
 Venice,
 they
 were
 open


economies,
 free
 trade,
 um,
 free
 movement


of,
 uh,
 labor,
 thought,
 and
 so
 on.
 What


they
 all
 have
 in
 common
 in
 terms
 of
 the


end
 of
 the
 golden
 ages
 is


what
 are
 you
 leaning
 against
 right
 now?


Well,
 I
 think
 uh
 the
 stuff
 to
 lean


against
 if
 you
 really
 want
 to
 do
 the


opposite
 of
 everybody
 else
 would
 be
 to,


you
 know,
 do
 less
 AI
 related
 investments


and
 more
 real
 estate
 investments.


>> How
 do
 you
 see
 real
 estate
 playing
 out?


>> Well,
 that's
 a
 very
 tough
 one,
 right?


But
 it's
 not
 very
 popular
 and
 I
 see
 that


uh
 a
 lot
 of
 big
 investors
 are
 uh


reducing
 their
 exposures
 to
 to
 real


estate.
 So,
 that's
 probably
 a
 good
 sign,


right,
 that
 there
 are
 better
 times


ahead.


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 of
 office?
 I
 I
 guess


that's
 the
 worst
 real
 estate
 classroom.


>> It's
 very
 bad.
 It's
 very
 bad.


>> So,
 you
 have
 to
 think
 uh
 in
 a
 way
 you've


had
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 perfect
 crisis
 there
 now


in
 that
 uh
 COVID
 meant
 that
 more
 people


were
 working
 from
 home.
 You
 had
 uh
 some


trouble
 with
 uh
 you
 know
 part
 of
 the


banking
 system.
 You
 had
 rates
 uh
 you


know
 being
 relatively
 high
 and
 so
 you


had
 a
 few
 factors
 there
 uh
 impacting
 it


negatively.


>> How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 rates?
 I
 mean


historically
 there's
 been
 a
 I
 think
 the


average
 is
 6%
 or
 something
 somewhere


thereabouts
 and
 we've
 been
 lower
 than


that
 for
 almost
 20
 years
 now.


>> Yeah.
 We
 have
 been
 very
 low
 and
 for
 a


very
 long
 period
 of
 time.
 I
 think
 there


are
 some
 structural
 issues
 which
 mean


that
 they
 probably
 will
 be


a
 bit
 higher
 than
 they
 have
 been
 and
 I


think
 one
 one
 um
 factor
 here
 which
 uh


you
 know
 people
 don't
 talk
 so
 much
 about


just
 now
 is
 is
 the
 impact
 on
 climate
 you


know
 so
 climate
 is
 impacting
 harvest
 is


impacting
 prices
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 know


raw
 material
 and
 uh
 and
 impact
 factors


in
 particular
 to
 the
 food
 side
 so
 be
 it


uh
 you
 know
 chocolate
 coffee
 and
 so
 on


then
 you
 got
 various
 fires
 uh
 you
 just


you
 just
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 kind
 of
 impacts


from
 climate
 on
 pricing
 structures


um
 you
 know
 it
 also
 hits
 kind
 of


insurance
 rates
 free
 insurance
 rates
 um


and
 so
 on
 so
 that's
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 now


the
 thing
 which
 is
 pulling
 in
 the
 other


direction
 is
 of
 course
 efficiency
 gains


through
 AI
 and
 uh
 you'll
 have
 uh
 you


know
 just
 much
 more
 intelligence


uh
 at
 cheaper
 levels
 right


>> where
 do
 you
 think
 the
 tech
 sector


evolves
 from
 here.


>> Well,
 that's
 the
 trillion
 dollar


question,
 right?


>> Luckily,
 you
 manage
 what,
 two
 trillion.


So,


>> um,
 it's
 pretty
 pretty
 hot,
 right?
 That


I
 think
 we
 can
 agree
 on
 that.
 And
 I


think it's
 quite
 interesting.
 So,
 you


have
 Yansen
 Huang,
 the
 CEO
 of
 N
 Media,


who
 goes
 to
 Korea,
 right?
 He
 hangs
 out


with
 the
 guys
 at
 Samsung.
 they
 go
 and


have
 uh
 you
 know
 some
 uh
 deep
 fried


chicken
 and
 so
 when
 they
 are


photographed
 in
 this
 uh
 chicken
 uh


restaurant
 the
 share
 price
 of
 uh
 of
 that


chicken
 chain
 is
 going
 up
 like
 20%
 right


and
 the
 company
 that
 actually
 breeds


chicken
 in
 Korea
 is
 going
 up
 a
 lot
 and


the
 company
 that
 does
 the
 robotic
 arms


to
 actually
 deep
 fry
 the
 chicken
 is
 also


going
 up
 a
 lot
 so
 it's
 uh
 just
 indicates


to
 me
 that
 this
 is
 now
 a
 very
 very
 hot


sector
 when
 things
 like
 that


What
 would
 be
 your
 argument
 for
 the
 fact


that
 we're
 in
 an
 AI
 bubble
 and
 then


against
 the
 fact
 that
 we're
 in


>> well
 I
 think
 um
 okay
 AI
 bubble
 you
 would


look
 at
 things
 like
 valuations
 you'd


look
 at
 circularity
 in
 terms
 of


ownership
 and
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 vendor


financing
 uh
 these
 type
 of
 things.
 um


you'd
 look
 at
 uh
 news
 coverage
 uh
 you


look
 at
 things
 like
 what
 happens
 when


they
 eat
 you
 know
 chicken
 at
 a


restaurant.
 So
 you
 just
 kind
 of
 just


look
 at
 how
 frothy
 a
 sector
 is.
 On
 the


other
 side
 it
 has
 huge
 um
 ramifications


for
 how
 we
 live
 our
 lives
 and
 we
 see
 in


our
 firm
 we
 are
 increasing
 productivity


probably
 by
 20%
 just
 by
 utilizing
 it


more
 and
 we're
 just
 stuffing
 it
 in


wherever
 we
 can
 and
 it's
 making
 a
 huge


impact.
 How
 does
 that
 show
 up
 the


increase
 in
 productivity?


>> Well,
 we
 it
 shows
 up
 um
 in
 that
 we
 do


more
 with
 the
 same
 amount
 of
 people.
 You


know,
 we
 have
 we
 are
 keeping
 headcount


now
 flat
 and
 we
 are
 just
 producing
 more


and
 producing
 better
 quality.


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 would
 cause
 inflation


to
 come
 back?


>> Um


slower
 world
 economy,
 you
 know,
 AI


leading
 to
 more
 productivity
 gains.
 uh


humanoids
 so
 increased
 use
 of
 robotics


which
 is
 just
 a
 cheaper
 labor
 supply.


>> Is
 AI
 making
 decisions
 now
 at
 the
 firm


or
 is
 it


>> No,
 we
 are
 there
 is
 always
 a
 human
 in


the
 loop
 but
 it's
 helping
 us.
 It's


supporting
 our
 decision-
 making.


>> Do
 you
 think
 it'll
 ever
 replace
 humans


in
 investing?


>> I
 uh
 not
 in
 our
 place.
 Um
 but
 clearly
 in


some
 places
 right
 you
 have
 uh
 fully


automated
 uh
 uh
 you
 know
 investment


models
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 places.


>> What
 skills
 do
 you
 think
 will
 matter


more
 in
 an
 AI
 world?


>> Interpersonal
 skills
 uh
 you
 know
 the


ability
 to
 talk
 to
 people,
 the
 ability


to
 listen
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 empathy.
 I


mean
 these
 these
 things
 have
 always
 been


important
 but
 they
 are
 just
 even
 more


important
 you
 know
 and
 I'm
 just
 I'm
 just


seeing
 it.
 so
 many
 places.
 It's
 really


really
 interesting.


>> You
 talked
 about
 uh
 the
 ability
 to


listen,
 I
 think,
 in
 your
 uh
 Wharton


commencement
 speech.


>> Yep.


>> Um
 how
 would
 you
 teach
 somebody
 to
 do


that?


>> Well,
 that's
 a
 tough
 one.
 Um


I
 mean,
 it
 can
 be
 taught
 in
 that
 you
 can


point
 it
 out
 to
 people
 that
 they
 talk


all
 the
 time
 and
 they
 don't
 listen,


right?
 So,
 you
 can
 say
 that,
 but
 I
 think


we
 we
 would
 fall
 back
 to
 how
 we
 are


generally.
 Um,
 and
 I
 think
 it
 needs
 to


come
 with
 some
 curiosity
 because
 if


you're
 not
 curious,
 you're
 not
 going
 to


listen.
 So,
 I
 think
 it
 goes
 it
 goes
 hand


inhand
 with
 that.
 I
 mean,
 generally
 you


should
 listen
 twice
 as
 much
 as
 you


speak,
 right?
 That's
 why
 you
 got
 two


ears
 and
 um
 but
 um


it's
 super
 important.


>> A
 lot
 of
 people
 think
 they're
 listening,


but
 they're
 not
 actually
 listening.


>> Yeah.
 They're
 just
 processing
 stuff
 and


can't
 wait
 to
 get
 to
 the
 next
 questions


themselves,
 you
 know?
 So
 there
 is
 there


is
 little
 listening.


Um
 I
 um
 I
 spoke
 to
 this
 guy
 called
 Saul


Pearlmutter.
 He
 is
 a
 scientist.
 He
 got


the
 Nobel
 Prize
 in
 physics.


And
 uh
 he
 said
 uh
 Nikolai
 we
 are
 now
 at


the
 stage
 in
 the
 world
 where
 we
 for
 the


first
 time
 can
 solve
 all
 the
 problems.


We
 can
 solve
 all
 the
 problems.
 We
 we


know
 how
 to
 solve
 the
 climate
 problem.


We
 know
 how
 to
 feed
 everybody
 in
 the


world.
 We
 have
 the
 technology.
 we
 have


the
 science.
 It's
 just
 that
 we
 don't


talk
 to
 each
 other.
 We
 don't
 listen.
 We


don't
 work
 together
 properly.
 So
 that's


why
 we
 need
 to
 zoom
 in.
 I
 think


>> would
 you
 say
 that's
 the
 biggest
 problem


in
 society?
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


problem
 now
 is
 um
 is
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 we


close
 up
 you
 know
 we
 um
 if
 you
 look
 at


the
 golden
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 golden


ages
 we've
 had
 and
 you
 look
 at
 you
 know


the
 real
 powers
 we've
 had
 during
 the


years
 you
 know
 Rome
 Venice


uh
 you
 know
 the
 Song
 Dynasty
 the


Netherlands
 you
 know
 these
 these
 places


which
 did
 really
 really
 well
 they
 were


open
 economies
 free
 trade
 um
 free


movement
 of
 uh
 labor
 thought
 and
 so
 on.


And
 what
 has
 what
 they
 all
 have
 in


common
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 end
 of
 the
 golden


ages
 is


uh
 close
 of
 free
 trades,
 tariffs,


um
 end
 of
 immigration,
 end
 of
 free


thought,
 the
 rise
 of
 the
 strong
 man,
 uh


attack
 on
 you
 know
 freedoms
 of
 all
 types


of
 you
 know
 sorts.
 And
 we
 are
 seeing


that
 in
 many
 places
 of
 the
 world.
 And
 uh


and
 that's
 a
 native.


>> Which
 one
 of
 those
 concerns
 you
 the


most?


>> All
 the
 above.
 For
 me,
 it's
 free
 speech.


It's
 like
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 the
 big


limiter.


>> Yeah.
 But
 you
 need
 you
 need
 new
 ideas,


you
 know,
 you
 need
 to
 rejuvenate


countries
 and
 societies.
 But
 clearly


free
 speech
 is
 important.
 How
 do
 you
 see


the
 difference
 between
 American
 and


European
 mindsets?


>> So,
 this
 is
 super
 interesting,
 right?


Um,


uh,
 and
 now
 I'm
 in
 New
 York
 for
 a
 month


and,
 you
 know,
 wow,
 the
 energy
 here,
 uh,


the
 entrepreneurship,
 the
 drive,
 you


know,
 I
 just
 get
 so
 much
 energy
 just


living
 here.
 Uh,
 level
 of
 ambitions


super
 high.


uh
 versus
 Europe
 where
 there
 is
 I
 mean


Europe
 is
 a
 fantastic
 place
 too
 right


but
 for
 different
 reasons
 um
 you
 know


culturally
 uh
 incredible
 uh
 you
 know


food
 pretty
 good
 in
 many
 places
 but
 less


ambitions
 you
 know
 the
 thing
 with


ambitions
 I
 think
 it's
 so
 interesting
 if


you
 have
 really
 really
 high
 ambitions


you
 achieve
 great
 things
 even
 if
 you


fail
 if
 you
 have
 low
 ambitions
 you


achieve
 nothing
 even
 if
 you
 succeed
 and


so
 having
 great
 ambitions
 is
 just


fantastic


And
 you
 know
 in
 in
 America
 five
 I
 mean


do
 you
 think
 five
 is
 a
 high
 number
 or
 a


low
 number


>> for
 what?


>> Well
 just
 generally
 number
 is
 number


five
 high


>> low.


>> Well
 there
 you
 go.
 You
 think
 you
 think


five
 is
 low?
 Okay.
 You
 asking
 you
 know
 a


European
 is
 five
 high
 or
 low?
 They
 would


say
 it's
 pretty
 high.
 So
 it's
 just
 like


and
 so
 the
 whole
 concept
 of
 you
 know


growth
 rates
 ambitions
 and
 so
 on
 is


different.
 And
 then
 of
 course
 you
 work


much
 harder
 in
 America.
 I
 mean
 that's


just
 not
 something
 I
 think.
 It's
 just


like
 the
 facts.
 you
 got
 less
 holiday


uh
 and
 so
 on.


>> Do
 you
 think
 that
 it's
 good
 or
 bad?


>> I
 think
 it's
 both.
 I
 think
 it's
 good
 for


um
 some
 things
 in
 society
 and
 I
 think


it's
 not
 so
 good
 for
 the
 people


involved.


>> It's
 so
 interesting
 because
 if
 you
 think


of
 it
 from
 an
 evolutionary
 point
 of


view,
 I
 mean,
 evolution
 doesn't
 care


about
 you.
 It
 cares
 about
 the
 species.


>> And
 so
 it
 would
 sacrifice
 you
 and
 make


you
 work
 harder
 for
 the
 good
 of
 the
 the


whole
 unit
 and
 the
 survival
 of
 the
 unit.


Was
 it
 a
 culture
 shock
 when
 you
 came
 to


Wharton?


>> To
 Wharton?


>> Yeah.


>> Absolutely.
 Absolutely.
 Well,
 you
 see


the
 um
 in
 a
 way
 in
 Norway
 is
 the


opposite
 of
 Wharton.


Um
 because
 in
 Norway
 everybody's


supposed
 to
 be
 the
 same.
 You
 have
 this


thing
 called
 Yantelovven.
 It's
 just
 like


don't
 don't
 think
 you
 are
 fantastic
 in


any
 way,
 shape
 or
 form.
 Uh
 so
 you
 come


to
 I
 sit
 there
 in
 a
 class
 and
 it's
 just


like
 hey
 what
 do
 you
 guys
 want
 to


achieve
 in
 life?
 And
 one
 one
 of
 the
 my


fellow
 students
 just
 hands
 up
 what
 do


you
 want
 to
 do?
 I
 just
 want
 to
 conquer


the
 world.
 And
 that's
 kind
 of
 a


statement
 which
 is
 totally
 normal,


>> you
 know,
 at
 Wharton,
 but
 it's
 not


particularly
 normal
 in
 where
 I'm
 from.


>> How
 would
 you
 change
 that
 to
 add
 more


ambition?


>> I
 don't
 think
 you
 can
 change
 it.
 You


can't
 you
 can't
 change
 a
 you
 can't


change
 a
 nation,
 but
 you
 can
 change
 it


in
 your
 own
 company,
 and
 you
 can
 work
 on


the
 corporate
 culture,
 in
 the
 firm
 you


work,
 and
 you
 can
 change
 it
 with


yourself
 and
 your
 family
 and
 your


friends.
 But
 to
 change
 the
 ambition


level
 of
 a
 whole
 country,
 I
 don't
 think


you
 can
 do
 that.
 It's
 tough.


>> How
 would
 you
 go
 about
 it
 if
 you
 had
 to


if
 that
 was
 your
 task?


>> Okay.
 So,
 I
 never
 do
 politics
 because
 my


job
 is
 is
 totally
 not
 political.


>> But
 if
 I
 were
 like
 uh
 prime
 minister
 for


a
 day


>> and
 your
 only
 job
 just
 ambition,
 nothing


sort
 of
 like


>> I
 would
 I
 would
 inject
 AI
 everywhere.
 Um


I
 would


I
 would
 just
 go
 all
 in.


I
 would
 do
 what
 they
 did
 you
 know
 in


Sweden
 in
 the
 80s
 they
 had
 something


called
 home
 PC
 so
 they
 bought
 800,000


PCs
 in
 a
 country
 of
 I
 don't
 know
 at
 that


stage
 let's
 say
 it
 was
 67
 million
 or


something
 eight
 um
 put
 them
 in
 people's


homes
 and
 it
 just
 increased
 the


digitalization
 of
 the
 country
 so
 now
 you


have
 you
 know
 Spotify
 cla
 all
 these


things
 so
 is
 it
 directly
 linked
 no


probably
 not
 but
 you
 know
 they
 they


increase
 the
 digitization
 now
 they're


doing
 the
 same
 thing
 with
 AI
 now
 they're


doing
 the
 same
 in
 Iceland
 in
 Iceland


they
 are
 they
 just
 did
 a
 they
 announced


a
 cooperation
 project
 with
 um
 uh
 you


know
 with
 Antropics
 where
 they're


basically
 going
 to
 stuff
 it
 in
 to
 all


the
 schools
 and
 all
 that
 kind
 of
 thing


and
 I
 think
 it
 should
 be
 perfect
 for


Norway.
 high
 highly
 digitalized
 country


and
 where
 people
 think
 it's
 pretty
 nice


to
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 spare
 time
 and
 of


course
 AI
 helps
 you
 with
 that


and
 it's
 a
 once
 you
 know
 you
 you
 read


the
 book
 uh
 about
 uh
 Nvidia
 for
 instance


and
 Yensson
 Huang
 talks
 about
 this
 once


in
 a
 lifetime
 opportunity
 and
 this
 is


just
 a
 once
 in
 a-lifetime
 opportunity


for
 people
 companies
 and
 countries
 to


pull
 apart


>> and
 if
 you
 don't
 do
 that
 you're
 sort
 of


going
 to
 be
 left
 behind
 if
 people


There's
 uh
 two
 I
 mean
 Alpha
 School
 I


guess
 is
 one
 of
 them
 who's
 who's
 using


AI
 to
 get
 curriculum
 down
 to
 two
 hours
 a


day.
 The
 students
 are
 getting
 massively


better
 outcomes
 and
 then
 synthesis
 is


tutor
 has
 created
 this
 math
 program


through
 I
 think
 it's
 uh
 kindergarten


through
 grade
 eight
 or
 nine
 now
 and
 the


results
 are
 like
 just
 off
 the
 charts.


They
 move
 kids
 two
 standard
 deviations


within
 like
 3
 or
 4
 months.
 And
 so
 we've


demonstrated
 that
 it's
 better
 than


teachers.
 But
 the
 impediment
 to
 that


would
 be
 what
 do
 you
 think?
 Like
 why


wouldn't
 people
 do
 it?
 What
 would
 be
 the


argument
 against


>> I
 don't know
 why
 people
 would
 do
 it.


They
 should
 do
 it.
 I
 mean
 they
 so
 should


do
 it.


>> What's
 the
 most
 important
 data
 you
 look


at
 these
 days?


>> Uh
 I
 don't
 have
 like
 just
 one
 or
 two


data
 sources.
 I
 read
 uh
 just
 a
 lot
 of


newspapers
 and
 I
 think
 what's
 going
 on


in
 the
 world
 now
 is
 just
 so
 incredibly


fascinating
 and
 it's
 so
 exciting
 to
 be


alive,
 you
 know,
 and
 so
 I
 just
 wake
 up


at
 5
 and
 I
 just
 spin
 out
 of
 bed.
 I
 just


can't
 wait
 to
 get
 out
 of
 bed
 uh
 to
 start


to
 read
 the
 papers
 and
 then
 I
 just


start,
 you
 know,
 the
 Financial
 Times,


Wall
 Street
 Journal,
 New
 York
 Times,
 all


these
 things.
 And
 wow,
 the
 stuff
 that


goes
 on
 now
 is
 just
 in
 incredible
 things


that
 you
 didn't
 think
 was
 possible
 uh


you
 know
 a
 year
 ago
 that's
 now


happening,
 right?
 Um,
 so
 I
 was
 up
 in
 a


forest
 um
 a
 few
 weeks
 ago
 and
 um
 with


seven
 of
 my
 best
 friends
 and
 um
 and
 we


were
 predicting
 okay
 what's
 going
 to


happen
 over
 the
 next
 12
 months.
 So
 we


and
 we
 tape
 it
 we
 tape
 recorded
 and
 then


we
 were
 we
 were
 playing
 our
 predictions


from
 last
 year


and
 you
 know
 these
 are
 really
 clever


people
 and
 how
 do
 you
 think
 we
 did?


>> Terrible.
 Terrible.
 Terrible.
 I
 mean
 we


were
 like
 80%
 wrong.
 You
 know,
 we
 didn't


we
 didn't
 we
 didn't
 predict
 that
 Trump


would
 win
 the
 election
 a
 few
 weeks


later.
 We
 didn't
 we
 didn't
 think
 about


like
 tariffs
 and
 relationship
 between


the
 US,
 Europe,
 you
 know,
 what's
 going


on
 now
 in
 the
 US
 in
 Europe,
 in
 India,
 in


China.
 We
 had
 no
 clue.
 And
 so
 I
 think


trying
 to
 predict
 in
 this
 world
 is
 just


more
 and
 more,
 you
 know,
 useless.


So
 what
 you
 need
 to
 do,
 you
 just
 need
 to


work
 on
 speed
 and
 agility.


Go
 deeper
 on
 that
 for
 a
 second.
 How


important
 is
 speed
 and
 agility?


>> Well,
 I
 have
 a
 big
 thing
 with
 speed,
 you


know,
 speed
 is


well,
 I
 mean,
 speed
 speed
 is
 a
 mindset


and
 it
 is,
 you
 know,
 um
 he
 struck
 me


again
 going
 back
 to
 New
 York,
 you
 know,


I
 buy
 this
 every
 morning,
 I
 buy
 this
 uh


you
 know,
 egg
 and
 uh
 egg
 and
 ham
 roll


and
 just
 speed
 with
 which
 they
 wrap
 it.


I
 mean,
 my
 so
 the
 speed
 in
 New York
 is


very
 high,
 but
 speed
 generally
 I
 think


is
 is
 super
 important,
 you
 know.
 Um
 it


comes
 to
 this
 first
 principle.
 Things


shouldn't
 take
 longer
 than
 than
 they


need
 to
 take.
 You
 know
 um


you
 save
 time
 by
 being
 fast.
 So
 this


sounds
 a
 bit
 um
 strange
 but
 you
 know
 if


you
 answer
 if
 I
 if
 I
 send
 you
 an
 email


and
 you
 answer
 within
 one
 minute
 how


long
 does
 that
 email
 need
 to
 be?
 Two
 two


words,
 right?
 And
 I'm
 impressed
 because


you
 answer
 really
 quickly.
 If
 you
 answer


the
 next
 day,
 how
 long
 does
 it
 have
 to


be?
 what
 a
 paragraph
 and
 you
 answer
 a


week
 later.
 It
 needs
 to
 be
 a
 page,


right?
 So
 you
 so
 you
 just
 save
 time
 by


being
 quick.


You're
 in
 meetings
 all
 day.
 You're


trying
 to
 stay
 present,
 but
 you're
 also


worried
 you'll
 forget
 the
 decision,
 the


action
 item,
 the
 important
 next
 step.


That's
 where
 Granola
 comes
 in.
 Granola


is
 an
 AI
 powered
 notepad
 for
 meetings.


You
 jot
 down
 rough
 notes
 like
 you
 always


do,
 and
 in
 the
 background,
 Granola


transcribes
 and
 turns
 them
 into
 clear,


useful
 notes
 when
 the
 meeting
 ends.


There
 are
 no
 bots
 joining
 your
 calls,
 no


distractions,
 just
 a
 clean
 notepad
 that


helps
 you
 focus.
 During
 or
 after
 the


call,
 you
 can
 chat
 with
 your
 notes.
 You


can
 ask
 Granola
 to
 pull
 out
 action


items,
 help
 you
 negotiate,
 make
 a


decision,
 write
 a
 follow-up
 email,
 and


so
 much
 more.
 I
 even
 use
 it
 when
 I'm


listening
 to
 podcasts.
 Once
 you
 try
 it


on
 a
 first
 meeting,
 it's
 hard
 to
 go


without.

Most
 things
 worth
 having
 in
 life
 reward


focus.
 Dating
 should,
 too.
 The
 League
 is


built
 for
 people
 like
 me
 who
 know
 who


they
 are
 and
 what
 they
 want.
 Instead
 of


endless
 options,
 it
 delivered
 me
 a


curated
 set
 of
 profiles
 each
 day,
 so
 my


time
 and
 attention
 stay
 directed
 towards


what
 matters.
 What
 stood
 out
 to
 me
 most


is
 the
 community.
 High-quality
 people


who
 are
 intentional
 and
 serious
 about


building
 something
 real.
 If
 you're
 ready


to
 approach
 dating
 the
 same
 way
 you


approach
 the
 rest
 of
 your
 life
 with


clarity
 and
 purpose,
 this

How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 urgency?
 That's


one
 thing
 we
 didn't
 that
 was
 not
 a
 word


we
 used
 when
 we
 were
 sort
 of
 like


thinking
 about
 uh
 American
 versus


European
 mindsets.


>> Yeah,
 I
 just
 think
 uh
 you
 know
 urgency


is
 I
 I
 try
 to
 build
 urgency
 into
 most


things.
 you
 know,
 in
 my
 office,
 I
 have
 a


I
 have
 this
 uh
 this
 watch,
 this
 kind
 of


clock,
 and
 it
 counts
 down
 the
 number
 the


days
 I've
 got
 left
 in
 in
 my
 job.
 So,


it's
 not
 because
 I
 look
 forward
 to
 to


stop
 working
 because
 I
 I
 love
 my
 job,


but
 I
 have
 this
 thing
 on
 the
 wall.
 And


so,
 you
 come
 in
 and
 say,
 "Hey,
 N,
 we


we're
 going
 to
 work
 on
 this
 and
 um
 do


you
 know,
 I'll
 I'll
 sort
 it
 by
 January."


And
 I
 said,
 "January,


look
 here.
 I've
 got
 1,765
 days
 left.
 We


need
 to
 do
 it
 now."
 And
 then
 he
 said,


"Oh,
 really?
 you
 only
 have
 1,765
 days


left.
 Yeah,
 let's
 do
 it
 now.
 Let's
 do
 it


now.
 So,
 you
 just
 you
 build
 urgency
 into


these
 tasks.
 I
 love
 it.


>> I
 like
 that.
 That's
 a
 really
 good
 idea.


>> When
 I
 was
 talking
 with
 Charlie
 Mer


about
 predicting,
 and
 he
 basically
 said,


"It's
 a
 fool's
 errand.
 It's
 better
 to


position
 and
 have
 agility,
 but
 you
 kind


of
 have
 to
 mix
 that
 with
 a
 stubbornness,


too."


>> Yeah.


>> How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 that?


Um
 so
 I
 think
 the
 most
 important
 thing


to
 have
 in
 investing
 is
 you
 need
 to
 be


stubborn
 but
 you
 need
 to
 have
 the


ability
 to
 change
 your
 mind.
 Very
 few


people
 have
 that.
 Um
 somebody
 like
 Stan


Rick
 and
 Miller
 has
 it


but
 the
 combination
 is
 rare.


You
 need
 to
 be
 stubborn
 in
 order
 to
 do


the
 opposite
 of
 everybody
 else.


Um
 and
 when
 you
 are
 when
 you
 do
 these


kind
 of
 contrarian
 investing
 investments


uh
 there
 will
 be
 periods
 where


everything
 goes
 against
 you
 and
 it's


stressful
 but
 you
 need
 to
 hang
 in
 there.


>> Do
 you
 think
 you
 can
 teach
 people
 to


change
 their
 minds?


>> Um
 I
 think
 you
 can
 to
 a
 certain
 extent


you
 can
 teach
 them.
 It's
 um
 easier
 as


you
 get
 older
 I
 think
 because
 you've


seen
 more
 cycles.


But
 it's
 difficult
 to
 find
 people
 who


are
 really
 contrarian
 now
 because
 it's


you
 need
 to
 you
 need
 to
 live
 in
 a
 in
 a


space
 where
 you
 are
 where
 people
 don't


agree
 with
 you
 and
 we
 you
 know
 in
 in


today's
 world
 everybody
 wants
 to
 be


liked
 and
 you
 know
 have
 100
 like
 you


know
 likes
 on
 Facebook
 or
 whatever
 and


so
 to
 be
 to
 be
 different
 from
 other


people
 is
 is
 tough.
 So
 now
 when
 I
 have


when
 I
 give
 presentations
 at


universities,
 I
 I
 ask
 people,
 hey,


anybody
 here
 who
 thinks
 differently
 from


other
 people
 who
 kind
 of
 think
 that
 they


are
 weird,
 that
 they
 that
 nobody


understands
 them,
 hands
 up.
 So
 typically


less
 than
 10%.
 I
 said,
 you
 guys,
 you're


great.
 We'd
 love
 to
 hire
 you.
 Can


everybody
 else
 put
 a
 hands
 up?
 And
 then


the
 other
 90%
 is
 like,
 you
 know,
 sorry


guys,
 you're
 just
 like
 everybody
 else.


You're
 never
 going
 to
 make
 much
 money,


but
 there
 is
 hope.
 you
 can
 change,
 you


know,
 and
 I
 I
 kind
 of
 think
 people


hopefully
 they
 go
 out
 of
 that
 room
 and


think,
 you
 know
 what,
 I
 want
 to
 be


different,
 you
 know.
 It's
 something
 we


should
 really
 treasure
 and
 and
 love.
 I,


you
 know,
 wear
 it
 is
 good,
 right?
 Go


deeper
 on
 that
 for
 a
 second
 in
 terms
 of


I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 optimize
 their


lives
 not
 necessarily
 to
 be
 liked,
 but


definitely
 not
 be,
 you
 know,
 hated
 or


disliked
 by
 people


>> and
 that
 causes
 all
 these
 weird
 societal


distortions.


>> Yeah.
 you
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 be
 disliked


even
 though
 you
 dis
 you you
 know
 people


disagree
 with
 you
 but
 you
 know
 in
 my
 in


my
 mind
 life
 is
 not
 a
 popularity
 contest


so
 my
 wife
 says
 that
 well
 only
 people


without
 friends
 say
 that
 but
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 think
 so
 I
 think
 you


life
 is
 for
 sure
 not
 the
 popularity


contest


and


>> you're
 definitely
 not
 popular
 all
 the


time
 you
 have
 that
 big
 number
 on
 the


screen


>> you
 can't
 you
 know
 you
 can't
 be
 popular


all
 the
 time
 and
 you
 have
 to


you
 know
 you
 have
 to
 be
 used
 to
 the
 fact


that
 whatever
 even
 if
 you're
 by
 10%
 will


disagree
 with
 you.


>> Do
 you
 read
 the
 comments
 that
 are


negative
 about
 you?


>> No.


>> Do
 you
 read?


>> But
 I
 also
 I
 also
 don't
 read
 the


positives.


>> Okay.


>> And
 I
 don't
 believe
 them.
 You
 know,
 I


don't
 believe
 the
 positives.
 I
 don't


believe
 the
 negatives.


>> So
 when
 you
 read
 the
 newspapers,
 like


how
 do
 you
 read
 them?
 Are
 you
 reading


headlines
 and
 then
 if
 it
 catches
 you,


you
 read
 the
 article
 or
 is
 there
 a


different
 way
 that
 you
 skim
 or
 process


that?
 I
 read
 I
 go
 through
 headlines
 and


then
 I
 drill
 down
 if
 it's
 either


something
 I
 am
 interested
 in
 or


something
 I
 know
 I
 should
 know
 more


about


uh
 or
 if
 I'm
 going
 to
 meet
 somebody


who's
 interested
 in
 that
 particular


field
 or
 I
 know
 somebody
 who's


interested
 then
 I
 pass
 it
 on
 to
 somebody


else
 or
 if
 I've
 met
 the
 person
 uh
 or
 had


him
 on
 our
 podcasts.


>> How
 do
 you
 test
 your
 assumptions
 before


making
 a
 big
 investment?


So
 that's
 where
 we
 that's
 where
 I
 think


we
 can
 be
 better
 and
 I
 think
 we
 can


develop
 this
 and
 I
 think
 the
 by
 using


more
 of
 a
 scientific
 method


um
 I
 think
 we
 can
 be
 better
 and
 I
 do


think
 that
 there
 is
 I
 I
 think
 there
 is


something
 called
 I
 think
 there
 is
 an


objective
 truth.
 I
 think
 there
 is


something
 which
 is
 correct
 and
 we
 need


to
 we
 need
 to
 find
 it
 and
 um
 so
 I
 have


much
 more
 of
 an
 open
 mind
 now
 than
 I
 had


in
 the
 past.
 I
 I
 think
 I
 listen
 to
 more


different
 types
 of
 input
 and
 opinions


and
 I
 try
 not
 to
 jump
 to
 conclusion.


>> Has
 that
 made
 you
 a
 better
 or
 worse


investor
 based
 on
 returns?


>> Well,
 so
 so
 I
 I
 don't
 run
 money
 myself


now.
 I'm
 you
 know
 running
 a
 a
 company


where
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 running


money.
 But
 for
 sure
 it's
 going
 to
 make


you
 a
 better
 investor
 if
 you
 take
 more


uh
 of
 the
 different
 opinions
 into
 into


the
 equation.
 If
 you
 are
 long
 something,


you
 listen
 to
 the
 shorts
 you
 and
 vice


versa.
 I
 mean,
 there
 really
 is
 a
 truth,


you
 know.
 Don't
 you
 think?


>> Do
 you
 think
 there
 is
 an
 objective


truth?


>> I
 would
 like
 to
 think
 so.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 But
 how
 do
 we


get
 at
 that
 truth
 is
 the


>> listening
 to
 different
 types
 of
 people.


>> Yeah.
 But
 then
 you're
 you're
 making
 a


judgment
 call
 at
 some
 point
 on
 what


>> what's
 closer
 to
 the
 truth
 and
 what's


not.


>> Of
 course.
 And
 then
 you
 have
 to
 kind
 of


uh
 well
 then
 you
 link
 in
 analysis
 and


you
 know
 some
 pattern
 recognition
 and


and
 so
 on
 and
 hopefully
 you
 get
 to


something
 which
 is
 correct.


>> I
 think
 the
 the
 source
 of
 most
 of
 our


poor
 decisions
 is
 just
 blind
 spots.


There's
 information
 we're
 missing.


There's
 something
 we
 don't
 see.
 There's


something
 and
 our
 job
 is
 to


>> um


>> reduce
 our
 blind
 spots.
 I
 don't know
 if


we
 can
 completely
 eliminate
 them
 but
 we


can
 definitely
 reduce
 it.


>> Yep.
 And
 then
 we
 reduce
 it
 through


talking
 to
 people
 and
 getting
 different


perspectives.
 And
 it's
 just
 like
 if
 you


and
 I
 were
 standing
 beside
 each
 other


right
 here
 and
 you
 took
 a
 photo
 and
 I


took
 a
 photo.
 Both
 of
 those
 photos
 are


100%
 accurate.


>> But
 if
 we
 add
 them
 together,
 we
 get
 more


of
 a
 picture
 than
 we
 do
 individually


because
 it'll
 be
 slightly
 different


because
 we're
 standing
 at
 slightly


different
 angles
 with
 different
 offsets.


>> Y


>> How
 is
 your
 attitude
 towards
 risk


changed?


>> It's
 um


it
 it's
 a
 difficult
 one.
 I
 amum
 probably


in
 some


ways
 become
 more
 risk
 averse.
 On
 the


other
 hand,
 there
 are
 some
 risks
 I


probably
 take
 more
 of
 now
 than
 I
 did
 in


the
 past.
 Right?
 So
 the
 risk
 people's


risk
 appetite
 uh
 depends
 on
 many
 things.


Um
 I
 mean
 everything
 else
 being
 equal,


men
 take
 more
 risk
 than
 women,
 which
 is


why
 we
 crash
 our
 cars
 much
 more,
 right?


Um


young
 take
 more
 than
 older
 people.


Extroverts
 take
 more
 than
 introverts.


It's
 geographically
 based,
 right?


American
 people
 take
 more
 risks
 than


let's
 say
 Asian
 people.


Um,
 and
 I'm
 sorry,
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 the


one
 who
 has
 invented
 this,
 okay?
 Because


I
 I
 did
 a
 degree
 in
 social
 psychology


and
 one
 of
 my
 papers
 was
 on
 exactly
 this


is
 just
 how
 is
 risk
 appetite
 linked
 to


the
 big
 five,
 you
 know?
 And
 uh
 so
 as
 you


get
 older
 on
 average
 you
 take
 a
 bit
 less


risk
 but
 as
 you
 also
 as
 you
 build
 wealth


you
 take
 a
 bit
 more
 risk
 sometimes.


Um
 so
 I
 don't
 I'm
 sorry
 this
 was
 a
 long


answer.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 I
 have
 a
 very
 clear


answer
 here.
 So
 risk
 is
 interesting


right?
 So
 then
 you
 talk
 to
 some
 people.


So
 in
 so
 let's
 say
 you
 do
 private
 equity


and
 you
 interview
 somebody
 like
 Steve


Schwarzman
 which
 we
 did
 on
 our
 podcast


right?
 So
 like
 okay
 it's
 really


important
 not
 to
 lose
 money.
 So
 you
 need


to
 really
 look
 at
 the
 downside.
 Now
 in


venture
 capital,
 it
 doesn't
 matter


whether
 you
 lose
 money
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff


as
 long
 as
 you
 capture
 the
 really
 big


winners,
 right?
 So
 you
 can
 lo
 you
 can


lose
 nine
 out
 of
 10
 as
 long
 as
 you
 get


the
 one,
 right,
 which
 is
 just
 like
 going


up
 like
 a
 rocket.


The
 the
 issue
 here
 is
 that
 the
 rocket


the
 the
 entry
 ticket
 for
 the
 rocket


which
 was
 $1
 million
 in
 the
 past,
 that's


not
 like
 $500
 million.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 that
 rocket
 better
 go
 up,
 right?


And
 you
 guys
 do
 mostly
 it's
 like
 index


plus.


>> Yeah,
 we
 are
 we
 are
 we
 are
 very
 index


there.
 We
 got
 a
 very
 uh
 we
 got
 a
 really


great
 investment
 mandate
 from
 the


minister
 of
 finance.
 It
 tells
 us
 how


we're
 going
 to
 be
 how
 roughly
 how
 we
 are


going
 to
 be
 positioned.
 It
 gives
 us
 a


risk
 budget
 and
 then
 we
 are
 pretty
 close


to
 that
 and
 that's
 that's
 important
 for


many
 things
 but
 it's
 also
 important


because
 it
 limits
 how
 much
 money
 we
 can


lose.
 So
 how
 does
 that
 work
 in
 practice?


you
 you
 basically
 like
 start
 with
 100%


in
 the
 index
 and
 then
 you're
 like
 okay


well
 we're
 going
 to
 take
 a
 little
 less


of
 this
 and
 a
 little
 more
 of
 that
 or


>> yeah
 pretty
 much
 right
 so
 we
 would
 have


I
 would
 say
 we
 have
 20%
 of
 the
 active


20%
 of
 the
 capital
 we
 would
 run
 in
 a


very
 active
 way
 and
 the
 other
 one
 the


other
 part
 of
 the
 capital
 will
 do


smaller
 tweaks


>> but
 you
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 coming


in
 every
 year
 I
 would
 imagine
 it's


probably
 on
 the
 order
 of
 a
 100


billionish
 if
 not
 more


>> well
 it's
 um
 it
 depends
 on
 energy
 prices


but
 uh
 generally
 there's
 been
 inflows


And
 so
 do
 you
 take
 that
 and
 you
 no


matter
 what
 the
 price
 is
 like
 say
 today


where
 you
 have
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 top
 seven


stocks
 account
 for
 46%
 of
 the
 US
 index


do
 you
 just
 how
 do
 you
 allocate
 that
 new


money
 coming
 in
 do
 you
 just
 sort
 of
 like


pop
 it
 into
 the
 index
 or


>> kind
 of
 we
 get
 we
 get
 uh
 the
 the
 the


inflows
 or
 outflows
 are
 they're
 monthly


right
 so
 you
 get
 the
 money
 uh
 on
 a


particular
 day
 and
 then
 you
 have
 to


think
 when
 do
 you
 deploy
 it
 into
 the


market
 you
 do
 it
 a
 did
 bit
 beforehand
 or


a
 bit
 afterwards
 or
 you
 know
 bit
 before


and
 after
 and
 we
 use
 AI
 to
 optimize


those
 type
 of
 decisions.


>> Do
 you
 try
 to
 frontr
 run
 index
 changes?


>> Yeah.


>> Using
 AI
 I
 would
 imagine.


>> Yeah.


>> What's
 gotten
 harder
 in
 investing?


>> Everything.


>> Nothing's
 gotten
 easier.
 No,


>> everything's
 gotten
 harder.


>> No,
 I
 mean
 everything
 has
 gone
 harder.
 I


would
 say
 what's
 getting
 getting
 easier


is
 research,
 right?


uh
 because
 of
 the
 deep
 research


functions
 in
 some
 of
 the
 models
 you
 get


incredible
 incredible
 amount
 of


knowledge
 within
 within
 5
 seconds.
 It


would
 take
 you
 ages
 to
 do
 that
 before


and
 it's
 well
 structured
 and
 it's
 um
 and


you
 can
 play
 around
 with
 it
 and
 so


that's
 I
 mean
 that's
 just
 phenomenal.


It's
 just
 phenomenal.


How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 the
 rise
 of


passive
 investing
 when
 it
 comes
 to


retail?
 What
 are
 the
 pros
 and
 cons
 of


that?
 Well,
 the
 pros
 is
 that
 it's


cheaper,
 so
 people
 don't
 pay
 that
 much


fees.


It's
 difficult
 to
 beat
 the
 market.
 Um,


the
 natives
 is
 that
 you
 will,
 I
 mean,


they
 would
 typically
 perpetuate
 uh


bubbles
 because
 with
 more
 passive
 money,


they
 go
 into,
 you
 know,
 stocks
 which


have
 done
 historically
 well
 and
 they


perpetuate
 uh
 the
 moves.


Is
 your
 goal
 active
 return
 like
 a
 active


um
 or
 total
 return
 absolute
 return
 or
 is


it
 sort
 of
 relative
 to
 the
 index?


>> Relative
 relative
 to
 the
 ind.


>> So
 we
 are
 measured
 against
 a
 reference


index
 which
 is
 uh
 constructed
 by
 the


ministry
 and
 then
 we
 try
 to
 beat
 that.


Historically
 over
 the
 last
 close
 to
 30


years
 we've
 had
 25
 basis
 points
 of


performance.
 So
 you
 would
 say
 hey
 that's


not
 so
 much.
 Well,
 the
 thing
 is
 that
 if


if
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 money,


>> it's
 these
 are
 pretty
 they
 it
 ends
 up


being
 pretty
 big
 uh
 you
 know
 absolute
 uh


amounts.


>> And
 when
 you
 were
 running
 your
 own
 fund


before
 that,
 what
 was
 the
 the
 worst
 sort


of
 investing
 mistake
 that
 you
 made
 and


what
 happened?


The
 worst
 mistake
 was
 during
 the


financial
 crisis.
 We
 were
 in
 a
 subprime


lender
 and
 it
 turned
 out
 that
 there
 was


accounting
 fraud
 and
 um
 it
 was
 a
 big


position
 and
 that's
 that's
 the
 worst


that's
 the
 worst
 investment
 I've
 ever


made.
 Uh
 and
 what
 I
 learned
 was
 that
 um


you
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 into
 dubious


business
 models.
 And
 so
 Brian,
 you
 can


say,
 you
 know,
 it's
 not
 really


um
 certainly
 the
 type
 of
 company
 we're


invested,
 I
 I
 would
 say
 it's
 not
 really


I
 mean,
 is
 it
 ethical
 to


lend
 money
 to
 people
 who
 are
 in
 a
 tough


situation
 in
 life?
 Well,
 I
 don't
 know.


It
 certainly
 was
 a
 really
 bad


investment.
 I
 wouldn't
 invest
 in
 that


type
 of
 company.
 Now,


>> what
 would
 you
 like?
 What
 was
 the
 lesson


you
 took
 away
 from
 that?
 Is
 it
 the


business
 model?
 Is
 it
 the


>> it's
 just
 a
 business
 model
 and
 it's
 just


I
 I
 just
 don't
 want
 to
 I
 just
 don't


think
 you
 should
 profit
 from
 people
 who


have
 a
 tough
 time.


>> What
 would
 be
 the
 counterargument
 to


that
 if
 you
 were
 to
 argue
 with
 yourself?


I
 mean


>> I
 don't
 think
 there's
 a
 I
 don't
 think


there's
 a
 good
 counter
 argument.


>> The
 push
 back
 would
 Wouldn't
 it
 be
 like


maybe
 I'll
 play
 devil's
 advocate
 here


for
 a
 second,
 but
 wouldn't
 it
 be
 that


people
 uh
 all
 need
 credit?
 We've
 all


been
 down
 on
 our
 luck
 and
 maybe
 we
 don't


have
 the
 best
 credit
 rating
 and


>> but
 it's
 just
 how
 you
 do
 it
 and
 how
 you


go
 about
 it
 and
 what
 you
 charge
 for
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> It
 shouldn't
 be
 sort
 of
 user
 rates
 for


sure.


>> No.


>> Um
 did
 you
 do
 a
 postmortem
 after
 that?


>> Totally.


>> And
 then
 how
 do
 you
 have
 the
 confidence


to
 sort
 of
 come
 back
 and
 take
 big
 swings


after
 you
 lo
 like
 you
 lost
 a
 lot
 of


money
 on
 that
 one.


>> Because
 you
 as
 long
 as
 you
 don't
 do
 the


same
 mistake.
 I
 mean,
 why
 why
 why
 make


the
 same
 mistakes
 when
 there
 are
 so
 many


mistakes
 to
 take
 from,
 you
 know,
 you


find
 some
 new
 ones.


>> That's
 originality
 and
 mistakes.
 I
 love


it.


>> Um,
 but
 you
 know,
 Okay.
 So,
 so
 the
 risk


taking
 is
 really
 interesting.
 So,
 most


people
 take
 less
 risk
 when
 they
 lose


money.


>> Mhm.


>> Even
 though
 you
 should
 take
 the
 same


amount
 of
 risk.
 So,
 here
 we
 use
 a
 sports


psychologist.
 I
 I
 sail
 and
 I
 did
 a
 lot


of
 competition
 when
 I
 was
 a
 bit
 younger.


And
 I
 sailed
 with
 some
 of
 the
 British


Olympic
 sailors
 and
 they
 were
 just


really
 really
 good,
 right?
 And
 so
 I


asked
 them,
 hey,
 why
 are
 you
 so
 good?


Well,
 you
 know,
 we
 we
 have
 two
 reasons.


One,
 we
 have
 a
 very
 uh
 great
 we
 got
 a


really
 good
 debrief
 system
 and
 also
 we


work
 with
 sports
 psychologist,
 you
 know,


to
 work
 with
 mental
 type
 of
 uh
 you
 know,


strength.
 And
 so
 what
 is
 important
 in


sailing
 is
 that
 you
 know
 you
 can
 be


number
 one
 and
 then
 the
 wind
 the
 wind


direction
 changes
 and
 then
 suddenly


you're
 you're
 the
 last
 one.
 Now
 next


race
 you
 need
 to
 take
 the
 same
 type
 of


risks
 you
 know
 you
 cannot
 let
 it
 impact


you
 and
 that's
 the
 same
 way
 it
 is
 with


investing
 you
 know
 just
 because
 you
 lost


you
 need
 to
 get
 back
 on
 your
 horse
 and


take
 the
 same
 amount
 of
 risk
 and
 it's


very
 difficult
 and
 that's
 why
 you
 need


some
 psychologist
 to
 help
 you
 with
 this


um
 you
 know
 I
 did
 a
 podcast
 with
 Magnus


Carlson
 the
 chess
 player
 and
 so
 I
 asked


him
 hey
 what
 happens
 when
 you
 when
 you


lost
 you
 know
 a
 game
 do
 you
 take
 more


less
 or
 he
 takes
 more
 risk
 in
 the
 next


game
 which
 I
 think
 is
 interesting
 but


normally
 people
 take
 less
 That's


fascinating
 because
 I
 was
 thinking
 as


you
 were
 saying
 that
 a
 little
 bit
 that


the
 worst
 people
 would
 take
 less
 or
 more


risk
 because
 isn't
 that
 the
 I
 just


picture
 this
 guy
 at
 the
 or
 girl
 I
 guess


or
 whatever
 at
 the
 gambling
 table
 in


Vegas
 and
 they
 lose
 and
 they
 keep
 go
 you


know
 double
 down
 double
 down
 double


down.


>> Investors
 don't
 do
 that.


>> Yeah.
 Why
 did
 you
 take
 this
 job?
 Like


what
 did
 you
 see?


>> Why
 did
 you
 why
 did
 you
 want
 it?


>> Oh
 my
 it
 was
 my
 it
 was
 my
 it
 was
 my


dream
 job.
 Right.
 So
 I
 had
 um


I
 had
 run
 uh
 this
 investing
 company


investment
 company
 called
 AKO
 Capital


set
 it
 up
 and
 um
 it
 kind
 of
 turned
 15


years
 and
 and
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 time
 to


pass
 it
 on
 to
 the
 next
 generation
 and
 do


something
 else.
 So
 I
 wanted
 to
 go
 back


to
 university
 and
 do
 another
 degree
 and


uh
 learn
 some
 more
 more
 things.
 And
 then


I
 had
 just
 before
 that
 taken
 a
 degree
 in


done
 a
 degree
 in
 in
 social
 psychology


and
 uh
 organizational
 development.
 And


so
 when
 this
 job
 came
 up
 it
 was
 just


like
 wow
 you
 know
 it
 combines


uh
 you
 know
 asset
 management
 and
 asset


management
 is
 the
 most
 interesting
 thing


you
 can
 do
 in
 life
 because
 it's
 about


everything
 that
 moves
 everything
 you
 eat


where
 drive
 all
 that
 kind
 of
 thing.
 It's


about
 psychology.
 It's
 about
 markets.


It's
 about
 greed
 and
 fair.
 It's
 about


macroeconomy
 geopolitics
 defense.
 Uh
 it


it's
 about
 everything,
 right?
 So
 So
 it


is
 it
 is
 the
 most
 incredible
 game
 you


could
 ever
 construct.


Then
 I
 could
 combine
 it
 with


organization
 development
 and
 really
 see


whether
 we
 could
 take
 this
 organization,


you
 know,
 to
 a
 place
 that
 it
 hadn't
 been


before
 and
 then
 do
 something
 great
 for


the
 country.
 So
 all
 my
 interests
 came


together
 in
 one
 job.
 You
 know,
 people


talk
 a
 lot
 about
 product
 market
 fit,


sales
 tactics,
 or
 pricing
 strategy.
 But


the
 truth
 is,
 success
 in
 selling
 often


comes
 down
 to
 something
 much
 simpler,


the
 system
 behind
 the
 sale.
 That's
 why
 I


use
 and
 love
 Shopay,
 because
 nobody
 does


selling
 better
 than
 Shopify.
 They've


built
 the
 number
 one
 checkout
 on
 the


planet.
 And
 with
 Shopay,
 businesses
 see


up
 to
 50%
 higher
 conversions.
 That's
 not


a
 rounding
 error.
 That's
 a
 gamecher.


Attention
 is
 scarce.
 Shopify
 helps
 you


capture
 it.
 and
 convert
 it.
 If
 you're


building
 a
 serious
 business,
 your


commerce
 platform
 needs
 to
 meet
 your


customers
 wherever
 they
 are
 on
 your


site,
 in
 store,
 in
 their
 feed,
 or
 right


inside
 their
 inbox.
 The
 less
 they
 think,


the
 more
 they
 buy.
 Businesses
 that
 sell


more,
 sell
 on
 Shopify.
 If
 you're
 serious


about
 selling,
 the
 tech
 behind
 the


scenes
 matters
 as
 much
 as
 the
 product.


Upgrade
 your
 business
 and

 I

>> I'm
 a
 huge
 proponent
 in
 sovereign
 wealth


funds.
 How
 would
 you
 advise
 the
 United


States
 or
 Canada
 to
 set
 one
 up
 knowing


what
 you
 know
 now?


I
 I
 I
 I


think
 I'm
 too
 too
 humble
 to
 advise


anybody
 uh
 in
 that
 field.
 What
 has


worked
 well
 for
 Norway
 is
 to
 have
 a


sovereign
 wealth
 fund
 which
 is
 has
 broad


political
 anchoring.
 So
 the
 political


parties
 generally
 agree
 on
 the
 on
 the
 on


the
 big
 decisions
 which
 means
 that
 when


you
 have
 a
 change
 of
 government
 you
 do


not
 change
 the
 way
 you
 run
 the
 fund.


That's
 important.
 Then
 transparency,
 we


are
 the
 most
 transparent
 fund
 in
 the


world
 and
 there
 is
 actually
 a
 world


championship
 in
 that
 and
 we
 won
 it
 three


times
 in
 a
 row.
 Um
 it's
 a
 world


championship
 which
 has
 been
 run
 by


actually
 a
 Canadian
 company
 called
 SEM


in
 Toronto.
 Uh
 and
 then
 the
 last
 thing


is
 you
 have
 a
 we
 have
 a
 spending
 rule


which
 means
 that
 um
 the
 politicians


spend
 3%
 of
 the
 fund
 every
 year
 a


maximum
 of
 3%.
 So
 I
 think
 the
 you
 know


the
 broad
 political
 anchoring
 the


transparency
 and
 the
 spending
 rule
 those


those
 are
 three
 really
 important


factors.


>> Are
 there
 any
 acute
 sort
 of
 um
 political


factors
 that
 go
 into
 this?
 I
 imagine
 it


would
 become
 political.
 You're
 like
 20


or
 30%
 of
 the
 budget
 at
 this
 point.


>> Yeah.
 The
 fund
 is
 25%
 of
 the
 state


budget.
 Well
 the
 whole
 idea
 is
 that
 the


fund
 should
 not
 be
 political.
 And
 then


how
 do
 how
 does
 Norway's
 politics
 work


its
 way
 into
 how
 you
 might
 vote
 for
 your


shares
 on
 things
 like
 ESG
 or
 uh


>> yeah
 well
 so
 that's
 so
 that
 is
 not


politically
 decided
 that's
 decided


how
 is
 that


>> decided


>> well
 that
 is
 decided
 we
 got
 a
 group
 of


people
 who
 sit
 and
 look
 at
 votes
 right


and
 uh
 they
 are
 very
 very
 experienced


people
 so
 for
 instance
 we
 look
 at
 pay


packages
 are
 they
 structured
 in
 a
 way


which
 coincide
 with
 with
 the
 they
 um
 you


know
 I
 mean
 are
 they
 aligned
 with
 our


interests?


Are
 they
 long-term
 enough?
 Are
 they


equity
 based
 enough?
 Those
 kind
 of


things.


>> Did
 those
 decisions
 come
 up
 to
 you
 or


are
 you
 at least
 aware
 of
 the
 big
 ones?


>> I
 am
 aware
 of
 the
 big
 ones
 but
 I


deliberately
 do
 not
 uh
 make
 decisions


here.


>> What
 was
 the
 thinking
 behind
 voting


against
 Elon's
 pay
 package?
 Like
 what


was
 the
 rationale?
 Um
 well
 the
 team


thought
 it
 was
 too
 too
 big


and
 uh
 didn't
 have
 the
 right
 alignment


with
 shareholders.


>> Yeah.


>> Do
 you
 think


>> and
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 was
 dilutive


and


you
 know
 we
 own
 we
 own
 shares
 in
 9,000


companies.
 If
 if
 all
 the
 CEOs
 were
 going


to
 have
 a
 billion
 dollars
 that
 would
 be


pretty
 expensive
 for
 us.


I
 like
 to
 think
 of
 it
 as
 you
 basically


have
 a
 almost
 a
 2%
 toll
 on
 the
 world


economy
 at
 this
 point
 or
 something


similar.
 Is
 that
 a
 fair
 way
 to
 think


about
 it?


>> I
 think
 so.


>> I
 think
 that's
 a
 I
 think
 that's
 really


cool
 personally.


>> How
 do
 you
 build
 long-term
 thinking
 into


the
 organization?


>> It's
 very
 difficult
 because
 because


people
 want
 to
 do
 things.
 Okay.
 You


know,
 I
 think
 wealth
 wealth
 is
 basically


created
 by
 owning
 one
 or
 two
 really
 good


assets
 and
 then
 you
 just
 hold
 on
 to
 it


for
 the
 very
 long
 term.
 That's
 when
 you


when
 you
 know
 you
 look
 at
 the
 wealth


the
 really
 big
 pockets
 of
 wealth.
 That's


basically
 how
 it
 has
 been
 created.
 So


you
 make
 money
 by
 doing
 as
 little
 as


possible
 in
 terms
 of
 ownership
 and


change
 of
 ownership
 stakes.
 But
 imagine


now
 you're
 a
 portfolio
 manager.
 You
 come


home
 from
 work
 on
 Monday
 and
 your


husband
 asks
 you,
 "Hey,
 how
 how
 was
 it


today?
 What
 did
 you
 do?"
 I
 did
 nothing.


Okay.
 And
 next
 day,
 Tuesday,
 it's
 like,


"Hi,
 darling.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 what
 did
 you


do
 today?"
 Nothing.
 And
 the
 same
 thing


on
 Wednesday,
 Thursday,
 Friday,
 and
 it's


just
 like
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 week,
 hey,


did
 you
 did
 you
 do
 anything?
 No,
 I


didn't
 do
 a
 thing.
 It's
 um
 it's
 not


intuitive
 that
 that's
 easy,
 right?
 So,


very
 often
 the
 most
 difficult
 thing
 is


not
 to
 do
 anything.
 And
 so,
 one
 way
 to


look
 at
 it
 is
 what
 I
 call
 the
 inert


inertia
 analysis.
 It
 mean
 you
 take
 you


take
 the
 portfolio
 from
 January
 Jan
 one


and
 you
 and
 you
 see
 what
 would
 have
 been


the
 investment
 result
 if
 I
 just
 stuck
 to


that
 and
 not
 made
 a
 single
 change
 and


then
 you
 look
 at
 your
 actual
 results
 for


the
 year
 and
 so
 often
 you
 actually
 have


detracted
 from
 your
 performance
 by
 the


things
 you've
 done.


>> That
 is
 so
 true.
 What
 does
 it
 mean
 to


think
 long
 term?
 Like
 if
 you
 were
 to
 are


there
 elements
 to
 that
 thinking
 that
 go


into
 it?
 Um
 well,
 you
 have
 to
 figure
 out


what's
 your
 time
 horizon,
 right?


Ideally,
 we
 should
 be
 thinking


with
 a
 wealth
 fund,
 we
 should
 think
 50


years
 ahead.
 But
 that's
 tough
 because


you
 haven't
 got
 a
 clue
 what
 the
 world
 is


going
 to
 look
 like
 in
 50
 years
 time.
 We


don't
 even
 know
 what
 it's
 going
 to
 look


like
 in
 I
 would
 say
 three
 years
 time
 is


probably
 the
 max
 you
 can
 you
 can
 look


into
 the
 future.


So,
 it's
 very
 tough
 to
 be
 it's
 very


tough
 to
 be
 long-term
 in
 what
 you
 do.


I
 know
 um
 Draen
 Miller
 is
 widely
 known


to
 take
 a
 position
 then
 do
 research


after.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 do
 you
 do
 that
 as
 well
 or?


>> Well,
 I
 did
 I
 did
 that
 uh
 quite
 a
 lot


and
 I
 think
 it's
 why
 do
 you
 want
 to
 do


that?
 Well,
 um
 first
 of
 all
 you
 if
 your


gut
 feel
 is
 good
 and
 you
 know
 people


don't
 believe
 in
 gut
 feed.
 If
 you
 call


it
 gut
 feel
 if
 you
 call
 it
 pattern


recognition
 more
 people
 believe
 in
 it.


But
 if
 your
 if
 your
 pattern
 recognition


is
 good
 and
 you
 see
 something
 that
 looks


really
 interesting,
 the
 probability
 of


that
 being
 a
 good
 investment
 is
 pretty


high.
 Okay,
 it's
 like
 way
 over
 50%.


Um,
 and
 by
 taking
 a
 position,
 you
 create


some
 urgency
 in
 the
 research
 process


and
 it's
 also
 easier
 to
 add
 to
 add
 to


the
 position,
 you
 know,
 if
 it
 goes
 up


because
 you
 already
 have
 you
 already


have
 some
 shares,
 right?
 So,
 it's
 just


like
 mentally
 a
 bit
 easier
 to
 get
 going.


So,
 I
 I
 was
 in
 his
 camp.


Do
 you
 think
 you
 can
 teach
 intuition
 or


pattern
 recognition
 if
 you
 will?


>> No,
 you
 can't.
 But
 you
 can
 but
 you
 gain


it
 with
 time.
 So
 I
 did
 uh
 I
 did
 a


research
 process
 when
 I
 studied
 social


psychology.
 I
 interviewed
 the
 20
 best


asset
 managers
 in
 Europe
 and
 I
 asked


them
 you
 know
 about
 pattern
 recognition


you
 know
 when
 do
 you
 when
 do
 you
 use
 it


when
 don't
 you
 use
 it?
 Well
 first
 of
 all


you
 call
 it
 gutfield
 nobody
 believes
 in


it.
 You
 call
 it
 pattern
 recognition
 a


lot
 of
 people
 believe
 in
 it.
 You
 don't


believe
 in
 anybody
 else's
 gut
 feel
 only


your
 own.
 You
 can't
 apply
 it
 when
 you're


young
 because
 nobody
 believes
 in
 it.
 You


can't
 go
 to
 your
 boss
 and
 it's
 like
 hey


you
 know
 what
 I
 think
 we
 should
 I
 think


we
 should
 just
 you
 know
 buy
 you
 know
 100


million
 worth
 of
 Apple.
 It's
 like
 okay


well
 why
 it's
 just
 a
 gut
 feel
 I
 have.
 It


doesn't
 it
 doesn't
 work
 right?
 Nobody's


going
 to
 listen
 to
 you.
 So
 you
 need
 to


be
 pretty
 senior
 and
 ideally
 you
 want
 to


be
 the
 boss
 because
 if
 you're
 the
 boss


uh
 you
 can
 actually
 do
 it
 and
 it
 gets


better
 over
 time.
 So
 the
 best
 the
 best


people
 use
 a
 combination
 of
 the
 two.


They
 use
 a
 combination
 of
 pattern


recognition
 and
 analysis
 depending
 on


the
 situation.
 If
 you
 are
 if
 you
 press


for
 time
 you
 you
 are
 you're
 more
 likely


to
 use
 pattern
 recognition
 and
 if
 it's
 a


really
 complex
 situation
 where
 where


it's
 difficult
 to
 put
 numbers
 on
 the


outcome
 their
 pattern
 recognition
 is


more
 important.
 I
 think
 I
 remember
 an


interview
 with
 Magnus
 where
 he
 said


something
 like
 that
 whereas
 I
 have
 an


intuition
 like
 an
 intuitive
 recognition


of
 what
 move
 I'm
 going
 to
 make


>> and
 then
 the
 person
 the
 followup
 was
 why


does
 it
 take
 you
 like
 five
 minutes
 to


move
 sometimes
 and
 he's
 like
 well
 I'm


double-checking.


>> Yeah,


>> I'm
 slowing
 down.
 So
 what
 he
 does
 uh


well
 according
 to
 what
 he
 told
 me
 is


that
 he
 his
 uh
 his
 gut
 feel
 gives
 him


like
 three
 move
 three
 different
 types
 of


moves
 and
 then
 he
 analyze
 them
 and
 then


he
 spends
 like
 five
 10
 minutes
 but


beyond
 that
 uh
 time
 he
 doesn't
 need
 time


more
 than
 that
 because
 it
 doesn't
 add
 to


to
 the
 outcome
 and
 we
 we
 over
 anal
 there


are a
 lot
 of
 things
 we
 overanalyze


by
 overanalyzing
 you
 it
 doesn't
 often
 it


doesn't
 improve
 the
 outcome
 but
 it
 makes


you
 more
 confident
 about
 the
 outcome


which
 is
 also
 not
 always
 a
 good
 thing.


How
 do
 you
 re
 like
 how
 do
 you
 think


about
 chess
 which
 is
 sort
 of
 like
 a


defined
 board
 defined
 rules
 uh
 finite


it's
 knowable
 everything's
 knowable
 all


the
 information
 is
 knowable
 it's
 all


visible
 versus
 something
 like
 poker
 when


it
 comes
 to
 intuition


because
 you
 if
 you
 listen
 to
 conman
 I


mean
 his
 argument
 was
 to
 really
 develop


intuition
 you
 need
 a
 constant


environment
 rapid
 feedback
 and
 a
 lot
 of


iterations


and
 in
 investing
 You
 definitely
 don't


have
 a
 constant
 environment.
 Feedback


can
 sometimes
 take
 a
 long
 time
 and
 you


might
 not
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 iterations
 at
 the


table.


>> Well,
 I
 would
 argue
 you
 get
 feedback
 all


the
 time
 in
 investing.


>> How
 is
 that


>> because
 you
 well
 because
 you
 just
 the


share
 price
 tells
 you
 something,
 right?


>> But
 the
 share
 price
 tomorrow
 like
 if
 you


buy
 today,
 the
 share
 price
 tomorrow
 is


that
 feedback
 or
 is
 that
 sort
 of
 noise?


How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 that?


>> Well,
 it
 depends.
 It
 depends.
 It
 can
 be


can
 be
 either.


>> So,
 how
 do
 you
 know
 when
 you're
 wrong?


Well,
 generally
 speaking,
 uh,
 you
 know,


with
 the
 share
 prices
 going
 against
 you,


that's
 an
 indication
 of
 the
 fact
 that


you
 may
 be
 wrong.
 But
 of
 course,
 you


don't
 know
 for
 sure.


>> How
 do
 you
 seek
 out
 disagreement?


>> Well,
 first
 you
 have
 to
 create
 an


environment
 where
 people


are
 okay
 to
 disagree
 with
 you.
 You
 need


to
 listen.
 Um,


you
 need
 to
 take
 what
 they
 say
 into


consideration.


Uh,
 so
 you
 need
 to
 create
 that
 kind
 of


atmosphere.


In
 the
 beginning
 in
 my
 job,
 people


didn't
 disagree
 with
 me.
 They
 all
 agreed


and
 that's
 not
 very
 good.
 Now
 they


disagree
 all
 the
 time.
 You
 know,
 it's


really
 good.


>> How
 did
 you
 change
 that
 cuz
 that
 so


often
 leaders
 leaders
 insulated?


>> No,
 by
 creating
 that
 hopefully
 security


for
 people
 to
 be
 able
 to
 speak
 up.
 I


mean,
 is
 everybody
 telling
 me
 all
 the


things
 they
 mean
 all
 the
 time?
 No,
 of


course
 they
 don't
 because
 some
 people


have,
 you
 know,
 respect
 for
 the
 CEO
 and


that
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 But
 we
 are
 creating


ways
 of
 doing
 it.
 For
 in
 I
 mean
 you're


Canadian,
 right?
 So
 you
 are
 you
 I'm
 sure


you
 are,
 you
 know,
 into
 isoki.
 No,
 you


have
 these
 pucks
 is,
 you
 know,
 things


that
 you,
 you
 know,
 play
 with.
 We
 have


them
 on
 the
 table.
 It's
 just
 like,
 hey,


here
 is
 a
 straight
 puck.
 I
 disagree
 with


what
 you
 say.
 I
 think
 you're
 wrong.
 So


then
 you
 put
 the
 disagreement
 into
 like


a
 physical
 object
 and
 you
 take
 it
 away


from
 the
 person.
 So
 it's
 not
 personal.


It's
 just
 like,
 hey,
 you
 know what?
 I


think
 what
 you're
 saying
 here
 is
 just


crap.
 And
 that's
 really
 good.
 So
 in
 the


front
 now
 we
 have
 like
 a
 straight
 puck


award.
 So
 the
 people
 who
 is
 kind
 of


talking
 up
 uh
 you
 know
 properly


disagreeing
 with
 me
 gets
 a
 buck.
 It's


good.


>> I
 like
 that
 idea.


>> I
 love
 it.
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 really


good.


>> What
 other
 ideas
 do
 you
 use
 internally


that
 would
 be
 along
 the
 same
 lines
 that


may
 seem
 interesting
 or
 counterintuitive


that
 are
 actually
 super
 effective?


>> Well,
 you
 just
 have
 to
 work
 on
 getting
 a


feedback
 culture.
 You
 know,
 we
 are


working
 on
 it.
 It's
 not
 easy.
 It's
 not


easy
 to
 give
 feedback
 and
 it's
 not
 easy


to
 receive
 feedback.
 So,
 you
 just
 have


to
 do
 it
 all
 the
 time.
 I'm
 getting


better
 at
 it
 at
 this,
 you
 know.
 I'm
 I'm


I'm
 more
 of
 a
 straight
 talker.
 I
 tell


people
 more
 now
 that
 I
 disagree
 with


them
 and
 uh
 and
 I
 tried
 to
 give
 them


feedback
 straight
 after,
 but
 it's
 not


easy.
 People
 are
 very
 sensitive,
 you


know.


>> Is
 there
 anything
 you've
 learned
 about


how
 you
 disagree
 with
 people
 that
 makes


a
 difference?


>> Well,
 you
 I
 mean,
 you
 can
 pack
 it
 in
 a


touch,
 but
 I
 think
 you
 just
 want
 to
 be


pretty
 straight.


>> Yeah.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 sensitive
 when


you
 sort
 of


>> totally
 I
 mean
 but
 it's
 also
 the
 age


right
 I
 mean
 young
 people
 are
 very
 very


sensitive
 in
 in
 the
 Nordics
 we
 are
 like


hyper
 sensitive
 and
 in
 the
 public
 sector


they
 are
 very
 very
 sensitive
 you
 know.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 the
 the
 feedback
 you
 get


is
 it's
 so
 interesting
 because
 a
 lot
 of


these
 conversations
 actually
 turn
 into


that
 which
 is
 like
 I
 disagree
 with
 you


and
 then
 it's
 well
 I
 didn't
 like
 the
 way


you
 disagreed
 with
 me
 and
 you
 made
 me


feel
 and
 then
 the
 the
 whole
 topic
 of
 the


conversation
 has
 changed
 from
 the
 actual


thing
 where
 it's
 not
 like
 I
 disagree


with
 you
 as
 a
 person.
 I
 disagree
 with


your
 opinion
 on
 this
 thing,
 but
 now
 all


of a
 sudden
 we're
 talking
 about
 how
 you


feel
 about
 my
 disagreement.


>> Absolutely.


>> And
 it
 sort
 of
 derails
 things.
 It's


crazy.
 What
 do
 you
 look
 for
 when
 hiring?


Um,
 curiosity,
 intelligence,
 integrity,


drive.


>> How
 do
 you
 test
 for
 curiosity?
 Like,


what
 does
 that
 look
 like?


>> What
 are
 you
 trying
 to
 learn
 now?
 What


have
 you
 learned
 lately?
 What
 have
 you


learned
 lately?


>> Me,
 I'm
 learning
 every
 day.
 I've
 done


deep
 dive
 on
 you
 for
 the
 past
 Tuesday.


That


>> poor
 thing.


>> I've
 learned
 lots.
 I've
 learned
 lots


about
 you.
 One
 of
 the
 favorite
 things


that
 came
 up
 in
 my
 learning
 about
 you
 is


you
 have
 an
 ice
 cream
 stand
 outside
 of


your
 office
 or
 something.


>> That's
 really
 good.
 That's
 really
 good.


>> Yeah.
 Why
 do
 you
 use
 that?
 because
 you


want
 um
 you
 want
 people
 to
 come
 by
 and


talk
 to
 you.
 And
 so
 I
 got
 a
 sofa
 next
 to


the
 ice
 cream
 box
 and
 I
 kind
 of
 hang
 out


on
 the
 sofa
 quite
 a
 bit,
 you
 know,
 like


uh
 just
 chill
 there
 and
 then
 um
 people


come
 by
 to
 have
 an
 ice
 cream
 and
 say,


"Hey,
 what
 what
 are
 you
 working
 on
 just


now?"
 And
 they
 tell
 me
 what
 they're


working
 on
 and
 it's
 really
 interesting.


And
 sometimes
 he's
 like, "Yep,
 but
 have


you
 spoken
 to
 this
 guy?
 I
 think
 he
 or


she
 is
 doing
 the
 same
 thing
 as
 you.
 Have


you
 spoken
 to
 that
 person?"
 So
 I
 just


learn
 a
 lot.
 It's
 great.
 I
 mean
 the


payback
 on
 that
 ice
 cream
 box
 is


probably
 I
 don't
 know
 thousand
 times


payback
 at
 least.


>> One
 of the
 other
 things
 I
 learned
 about


you
 that
 I
 found
 fascinating
 that
 I


wanted
 to
 follow
 up
 on
 actually
 is
 you


had
 all
 these
 conversations
 after
 you


started
 or
 right
 before
 you
 started.


>> You
 had
 hundreds
 of
 conversations
 with


people.


>> I
 had
 140.


>> 140.
 What
 were
 those
 what
 was
 the


structure
 of
 those
 conversations
 like?


>> Um
 okay
 so
 this
 is
 something
 I
 learned


from
 a
 guy
 called
 Albert
 Benny.
 He
 was


the
 head
 of
 a
 company
 in
 Switzerland


called
 Gabberit
 and
 another
 one
 called


Lonza.
 And
 he
 said,
 "Nicoline,
 when
 you


because
 when
 I
 got
 the
 job,
 I
 thought,


you
 know,
 gee,
 I
 got
 the
 job.
 I
 mean,


what
 do
 you
 do
 when
 you
 get
 a
 new
 job?


What
 do
 you
 do?"
 So,
 I
 rang
 all
 the
 best


cos
 I've
 ever
 met.
 I
 said, "Hey,
 what
 do


I
 do?
 I
 I
 got
 a
 new
 job.
 I
 mean,
 how


should
 I
 how
 do
 you
 approach
 a
 new
 job?"


You
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 conversations
 with


people
 and
 you
 do
 them
 before
 you
 start


because
 after
 you
 started,
 you
 have
 you


won't
 have
 any
 time.
 and
 um
 and
 you
 do


it
 because
 people
 need
 to
 get
 to
 know


you
 and
 you
 need
 to
 get
 to
 know
 them
 and


you
 need
 more
 data
 points
 so
 that
 you


can
 make
 your
 decisions.
 So
 that's
 very


important.
 So
 I
 sit
 down
 with
 140
 people


and
 I
 just
 start,
 hey,
 what's
 on
 your


mind?


>> That's
 it.


Yeah.
 And
 then
 people
 have
 stuff
 on


their
 mind,
 right?
 Yeah.
 What
 do
 people


think
 about?
 That's
 very
 interesting.


But
 then
 of
 course
 you
 you
 develop
 it's


just
 like
 okay
 what
 is
 what
 are
 the
 what


are
 the
 good
 things
 here
 what
 would
 you


change
 what's
 your
 advice
 to
 me
 those


kind
 of
 things
 and
 it's
 very
 clear
 you


know
 when
 you
 the
 funny
 thing
 is
 that


when
 I
 had
 you
 know
 when
 you've
 had
 half


of
 them
 you've
 you
 get
 the
 general
 gest


of
 what
 you
 need
 to
 do


>> you've
 kind
 of
 triangulated
 like
 the


same
 thing
 is
 coming
 up
 over
 and
 over


again
 so
 that's
 a
 strong
 signal


>> absolutely
 I
 do
 the
 same
 now
 so
 I'm
 in


New
 York
 for
 a
 month
 I
 sit
 down
 with


everybody
 in
 the
 firm
 here
 we
 got
 100


and
 uh
 hey
 what's
 on
 your
 mind
 and
 um


you
 know
 there's
 a
 pattern
 emerging
 and


I
 if
 there
 is
 a
 problem
 I
 try
 to
 I
 well


I
 change
 it.
 Do
 you
 ask
 people
 what


you're
 doing
 that
 doesn't
 make
 sense?


>> Uh
 yeah
 I
 do
 but
 I
 probably
 should
 do


even
 more
 because
 people
 do
 generally


speaking
 we
 all
 do
 things
 which
 are


which
 don't
 make
 sense


>> and
 then
 inertia
 sort
 of
 like
 takes


overtally
 like
 we're
 doing


>> totally
 we
 make
 reports
 which
 nobody


reads
 right
 that
 kind
 of
 thing.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 so
 that's
 the
 first
 thing
 you
 do
 when


you
 when
 you
 talk
 to
 people.
 So
 then
 you


distill
 down
 okay
 of
 everything
 I've


taken
 from
 these
 140
 conversations
 what


is
 it
 what
 are
 the
 three
 most
 important


things
 and
 then
 you
 put
 together
 a


leader
 group
 and
 you
 execute
 those
 three


things
 and
 you
 take
 the
 time
 you
 spend


the
 time
 it
 takes
 people
 leaders
 who


fail
 they
 try
 to
 do
 too
 many
 things
 too


quickly
 and
 we
 were
 in
 the
 beginning
 I


we
 moved
 too
 quickly
 twice
 and
 then
 we


we
 got
 the
 message
 and
 we
 slowed
 down.


go
 deeper
 on
 that
 for
 a
 second
 because


that
 that
 strikes
 me
 as
 um
 something


really
 interesting
 where
 a
 lot
 of
 people


are
 trying
 to
 go
 faster
 and
 faster
 and


I'm
 thinking
 you
 know
 specifically
 uh
 my


friend
 Cass
 had
 a
 shirt
 on
 yesterday
 he


did
 the
 uh
 open
 investor
 call
 um
 and
 his


shirt
 literally
 said
 faster
 and
 he
 was


all
 about
 increasing
 velocity
 and
 he
 had


just
 taken
 over
 I
 think
 uh
 September


14th
 or
 16th
 or
 whatever
 um
 but
 like
 how


do
 you
 how
 how
 do
 you
 yeah
 just
 go


deeper
 on


First
 of
 all,
 um
 you
 need
 to
 you
 need
 to


execute
 change
 as
 a
 combined
 leader


group
 because
 if
 you
 if
 you
 don't
 have


if
 you
 don't
 if
 you
 aren't
 a
 combined


leader
 group
 and
 you
 try
 to
 do
 something


on
 your
 own,
 you'll
 trigger
 uh
 the


immune
 system
 of
 the
 organization.
 You


know,
 the
 organization
 just
 want
 to
 have


you
 out
 and
 they
 often
 succeed.
 You


know,
 you
 are
 isolated,
 you
 just
 don't


get
 things
 done
 and
 so
 on.
 So
 you
 need


to
 the
 organization
 needs
 to
 feel
 okay


this
 is
 a
 this
 is
 a
 combined
 leader


group
 there
 is
 no
 it
 doesn't
 make
 any


sense
 to
 try
 to
 resist
 this
 change


because
 it's
 going
 to
 come
 I
 can
 just
 as


well
 just
 cave
 in
 and
 accept
 it
 right


um
 and
 then
 you
 need
 to
 you
 need
 to


prioritize
 and
 you
 need
 to
 have
 not
 too


many
 things
 and
 you
 need
 to


overcommunicate


and
 um
 the
 thing
 with
 overcommunication


it's
 become
 just
 becoming
 clearer
 and


clearer
 you
 know
 you
 think
 you've
 said


it
 you
 think
 they've
 heard
 it
 they


haven't
 heard
 it
 it's
 very
 very
 tough
 to


get
 something
 to
 really
 permeate
 through


an
 organization.


So
 we
 just


>> But
 then
 you
 think,
 gee,
 I've
 said
 it
 10


times
 and
 I
 nearly
 I'm
 I'm
 so
 bored
 of


myself,
 but
 then
 you're
 only
 halfway.


Just
 need
 to
 keep
 going,
 you
 know?


>> Same
 message
 over
 and
 over
 and
 over


again.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 how
 do
 you
 evaluate
 CEOs
 from
 a


competence
 point
 of
 view
 from
 the


outside
 just
 using
 public
 information?


What's
 your
 thought
 process
 when
 you're


sort
 of
 evaluating
 whether
 this
 person's


effective
 or
 ineffective?


I
 think
 it's
 difficult
 to


see
 before
 they
 have
 been
 in
 the


position.


Most
 people
 I
 see
 are
 competent


otherwise
 they
 wouldn't
 have
 gotten
 the


job
 you
 know
 they
 are


>> they
 are
 I
 mean
 they
 know
 their
 stuff


right
 they
 know
 the
 company
 they
 know


the
 things
 but
 are
 they
 good


communicators
 are
 they
 good
 at
 executing


it's
 tough
 to
 see
 from
 the
 outside


how
 long
 after
 somebody
 has
 taken
 over


do
 you
 start
 to
 see
 it
 in
 the
 finances


like
 the
 analytic
 numbers
 the


quantitative
 numbers


>> I
 think
 it
 depends
 it
 depends
 on
 Uh,
 it


depends
 on
 the
 business
 cycle.
 It


depends
 on
 kind
 of
 the
 product
 cycle
 of


a
 company.


But
 it
 takes
 time
 to
 turn
 around
 a


company.


>> Totally.
 I
 guess
 the


>> I
 would
 say
 to
 change
 a
 culture
 is
 a


10-year
 project.


>> Oh,
 wow.


>> Yeah.


>> Why
 do
 you
 think
 it
 takes
 so
 long?


>> Well,
 I
 mean
 this
 I've
 been
 in
 the
 job


for
 5
 years
 now.
 I
 think
 I'm
 roughly


half
 the
 way
 in.


>> If
 you
 had
 to
 do
 it
 faster,
 how
 would


you
 do
 it?
 Is
 it
 a
 matter
 of
 force?
 Like


if
 we
 think
 of
 it
 from
 physics
 it's


>> no
 I
 think
 if
 you
 do
 it
 faster
 you
 need


to
 lay
 off
 people
 then
 you
 need
 to


change
 the
 people


>> right


>> and
 in
 some
 in
 some
 businesses
 you
 can


do
 that
 but
 but
 I
 but
 you
 know
 we
 can't


do
 that
 in
 I
 mean
 in
 Europe
 it's
 it's


difficult
 and
 also
 we
 got
 great
 people


you
 know
 we
 were
 amazing
 people
 I
 think


we
 got
 an
 incredible
 lineup
 of
 you
 know


very
 very
 able
 you
 know
 professionals


and
 so
 you
 know
 but
 there
 just
 are
 a
 few


things
 that
 we'd
 love
 to
 you
 to
 change,


right?
 We
 want
 to
 have
 more
 feedback


into
 the
 system.
 We
 want
 to
 move
 a
 bit


faster.
 We
 want
 to
 have
 a
 bit
 less
 fear.


We
 want
 to
 uh
 do
 these
 kind
 of
 things.


>> But
 that
 was
 I
 mean
 it
 was
 uh
 it


probably
 it
 wasn't
 working
 as
 well
 um


before
 you
 as
 now
 maybe.
 Um
 but
 it's


sort
 of
 like
 that's
 working
 when
 you


think
 about


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 it
 was
 working
 well.
 I
 mean


it
 was
 is
 a
 great
 company.
 It
 was
 not


nothing
 wrong
 with
 the
 company.
 I
 mean


really
 good.
 I
 mean,
 just
 had
 a


fantastic
 performance,
 right?
 But
 I
 just


thought
 it
 needed
 some
 tweaks.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 I
 mean,
 technologically,
 it
 was


topnotch.
 Um,
 compliance-wise,


top-notch,
 a
 lot
 of
 really,
 really
 good


things.
 It's
 the
 envy
 of
 the
 world
 now.


Well,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 good
 company.
 You've


taken
 I
 mean,
 just
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 the


sovereign
 wealth
 fund,
 too,
 right?


you've
 taken
 these
 these
 reserves
 that


you
 have
 and
 you've
 turned
 them
 into


perpetual
 wealth
 not
 only
 for
 all
 your


citizens
 but
 global
 influence
 and
 a


tollbridge
 on
 the
 world
 economy.
 I
 mean


I
 think
 that's
 amazing.


>> Well
 I
 well
 I
 so
 I
 would
 say
 that's


that's
 really
 the
 um
 that's
 to
 the


credit
 of
 the
 politicians.
 You
 know,
 the


politicians
 decided
 when
 they
 found
 oil


and
 back
 in
 ' 69,
 I
 mean,
 they
 decided


after
 they
 found
 oil,
 listen,
 we
 should


put
 this
 into
 a
 fund
 and
 so
 in
 96
 they


set
 it
 up.
 First
 deposit
 was,
 you
 know,


relatively
 small
 and
 now
 it's
 grown
 a


lot,
 right?
 But
 the
 politicians
 were


really
 foresighted
 and
 uh
 and
 they've


been
 good
 ever
 since
 to
 be
 true
 to
 the


principles.


What
 are
 you
 trying
 to
 learn
 right
 now?


>> Lots
 of
 things.
 I


I
 I
 just
 feel
 I
 know
 so
 little
 and
 you


know
 I'm
 just
 looking
 at
 the
 podcasts


I'm
 doing
 over
 the
 next
 few
 months
 and


I'm
 learning
 about
 all
 these
 kind
 of


things
 and
 I
 needed
 to
 learn
 them
 anyway


but
 but
 that
 kind
 of
 makes
 it
 urgent.
 I


really
 need
 you
 know
 by
 next
 week
 I
 need


to
 know
 more
 about
 uh
 networks.


Um,


I
 need
 to
 read
 up
 on
 crypto.
 I
 need
 to


uh
 read
 up
 on
 IMF.


I
 need
 to


uh


Oh
 my,
 there
 is
 just
 so
 much
 I
 need
 to


learn.


>> You
 guys
 incredible.


>> You
 guys
 don't
 invest
 in


>> No,
 we
 don't.
 But
 I'm
 talking
 to


somebody
 who's
 in
 that
 space


>> in
 crypto
 at
 all.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 I
 just
 don't
 understand.
 I


don't
 understand
 it.
 So,
 I
 need
 to
 to


learn.
 Is
 it
 that
 you
 don't
 invest
 in


the
 coins
 themselves
 or
 you
 sort
 of
 like


a
 Bitcoin
 or
 you
 don't
 invest
 in
 the


exchanges
 like
 Coinbase
 or
 something?


>> Well,
 we
 have
 we
 have
 some
 we
 have
 some


ownership
 stakes
 in
 in
 some
 of
 the


infrastructure


>> because
 it's
 in
 the
 index
 and
 we
 are
 you


know
 so
 we
 would
 own
 it
 in
 a
 in
 a
 bit


more
 of
 a
 passive
 way.
 How
 much
 do
 you


work?


I
 work
 uh
 I
 work
 all
 the
 time,


>> but
 it's
 not
 work.
 It's


>> it's
 like
 Jensen.
 Is
 it
 like
 Jensen?
 You


wake
 up
 at
 5:00
 and
 you're
 like
 go
 go go


go
 until
 9:00
 and
 then
 you
 know
 for
 him


it
 it
 doesn't
 feel
 like
 work.
 It's
 just


>> wait
 to
 say
 I
 mean
 uh
 that's
 what
 he


that's
 what
 he
 told
 me
 and
 I
 kind
 of
 I
 I


mean
 he
 works
 more
 than
 he
 works
 a
 lot


more
 than
 me
 because
 he
 works
 every


holiday
 and
 every
 Saturday
 and
 every


Sunday
 and
 all
 the
 time.
 You
 know,
 I
 I


tend
 to
 wake
 up
 at
 5
 and
 then
 I
 read


papers
 and
 try
 to
 understand
 what's


going
 on
 in
 the
 world
 and
 then
 I


start
 to
 shoot
 mails
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 I


have
 a
 notepad
 at
 the
 side
 of
 my
 bed


because
 if
 I
 wake
 up
 in
 the
 middle
 of


the
 night
 I
 typically
 have
 some
 ideas


and
 if
 you
 don't
 get
 them
 done
 a
 piece


of
 paper
 you're
 going
 to
 forget
 them,


right?
 So
 I
 do
 that
 and
 then
 I
 work
 for


meetings


um
 and
 I
 read
 in
 the
 evenings
 and


uh
 you
 know
 check
 out
 the
 papers
 for
 the


next
 day
 and


but
 but
 it's
 not
 work.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 know
 it's
 just
 like
 it's
 life.
 So


many
 people
 Michael
 Oitz
 gave
 me
 this


phrase
 but
 it's
 like
 so
 many
 people


fight
 their
 job.
 Um,
 and
 so
 that
 it's


more
 of
 like
 a
 transaction
 than
 an


integration
 between
 work
 and
 life.
 And


>> strikes
 me
 that
 having
 the
 view
 that
 you


have
 towards
 work
 is
 much
 healthier.
 And


>> yeah,
 but
 not
 all
 people
 I
 mean,
 hey,


it's
 not
 like
 everybody
 have
 the


opportunity
 to
 work
 with
 what
 they
 love


and
 you
 know,
 not
 everybody
 is
 that


fortunate,
 but
 I've
 been
 really


fortunate
 in
 that
 I've
 ended
 up
 with
 the


things
 I
 I
 just
 cannot
 think
 of
 anything


more
 interesting
 in
 in
 the
 world.


>> Who
 do
 you
 go
 to
 for
 advice?


>> I
 go
 to
 lots
 of
 people.
 I
 um


I
 speak
 with
 as
 many
 people
 as
 I
 can.


The
 funny
 thing
 when
 you
 ask
 people
 for


advice,
 what
 do
 what
 do
 what
 do
 they


think
 about
 you
 afterwards?


>> Do
 you
 think
 they
 think
 that
 you
 are


more
 clever
 or
 less
 clever?


>> More


>> more
 clever.
 They
 because
 you
 must
 be


very
 clever
 who
 asked
 me
 for
 advice,
 you


know.
 He
 must
 he
 must
 be
 really
 clever.


He
 understands
 how
 clever
 I
 am
 and


therefore
 he
 wants
 to
 have
 my
 opinion.


>> What
 surprised
 you
 the
 most
 this
 year?


everything
 that
 goes
 on
 in


geopolitically,


>> you
 didn't
 see
 it
 coming
 or
 it
 just


continues
 to
 like
 push
 the
 limits
 of


what
 you
 thought
 was
 possible.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 that's
 makes
 life
 interesting
 to


live.
 You
 know,
 you
 can
 be
 you
 can
 do


one
 or
 two
 if
 you
 don't
 like
 what's


going
 on.
 You
 can
 be
 really
 depressed


about
 it
 or
 you
 can
 put
 on
 your
 student


hat
 and
 just
 think,
 "Oh
 my,
 I
 can't


believe
 I'm
 alive
 to
 see
 these
 things."


You
 know,
 it's
 so
 interesting.
 And
 I


think
 it
 is
 like
 super
 interesting.
 and


technology
 you
 know
 so
 the
 thing
 is
 that


everything
 is
 coming
 together
 at
 the


same
 time
 you
 know
 the
 technology


development
 now
 is
 just
 like
 totally


totally
 phenomenal
 right


>> what
 a
 time
 to
 be
 alive
 I
 wake
 up
 every


day
 yeah


>> and
 I
 remember
 it
 wasn't
 it
 was
 only
 a


couple
 weeks
 ago
 where
 um
 AI
 actually


made
 the
 first
 sort
 of
 um
 bio
 advance


that
 humans
 hadn't
 made
 was
 on
 cancer


research
 and
 they
 tested
 the
 hypothesis


and
 it
 was
 true
 and
 I
 was
 like
 this
 is


like
 Neil
 Armstrong
 stepping
 on
 the
 moon


like
 This
 is
 this
 is
 incredible.
 This
 is


the
 first
 stage
 of
 the
 first
 real
 thing.


I
 thought
 that
 was
 amazing.
 I
 was
 so


excited
 about
 that.


>> We
 always
 end
 with
 the
 same
 question


which
 is
 what
 is
 success
 for
 you?


>> Success
 is
 to
 make
 a
 an
 impact
 in
 other


people's
 life
 in
 a
 positive
 manner.


>> It's
 a
 great
 answer.
 Thank
 you
 for


taking
 the
 time
 today.
 I
 really


appreciate
 it.


>> Thank
 you.
