How do you know when you understand something deeply? There's no talent, a special miracle ability to understand quantum mechanics. Richard Feynman is this brilliant physicist who also was very good at explaining things simply. And the reason is he constantly questioned himself. He had these models about how the world worked. and he tested them over and over and over. When I first got to college, there was an older student who taught me that the best way to know whether I really understood something deeply was to teach it to somebody else. And that is the core tenant of the Feynman technique that's named after Richard Feynman. That technique has four steps. It starts by naming the topic. What is it that you're trying to learn about? Now write a full explanation under that, that's step two, of everything you know about this topic. So if what you're trying to understand is the concept of temperature, write your best definition of temperature, draw diagrams, show the wiggling of molecules. Once you've done all that, step three is to explain that concept as best as you can and as simply as you can. And what that does is it forces you to break down the concept, not just to the next. level of all of the vocab terms beneath it. You're breaking it down so far that even a 12 year old can with simple pictures in their mind understand what you're explaining. And that also reveals all the ways that you don't yet understand this concept. And what you can do then is you can do step four, which is ask further questions and go do research and better your model. And now you can start the whole process all over again and you can try again to explain that concept to somebody else.
