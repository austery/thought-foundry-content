 I
 always


>> Which
 one
 is
 which?


>> Yeah,
 I
 have
 to
 remember
 that.
 Um,
 well,


you
 can
 answer
 whenever
 you
 want.


>> Okay,
 that
 sounds
 good.


>> All
 right,


>> I
 might
 just
 sit
 back
 with
 this
 one.
 I


might
 just
 listen
 to
 the
 I
 might
 just


listen
 to
 Joe's
 answers
 and
 then
 listen


to
 your
 questions,
 which
 would
 be
 better


than
 mine.


>> I
 did
 a
 deadlift.
 I
 am
 both
 the
 most


popular
 trader
 and
 most
 successful


trader
 at
 Citadel.


>> Feta
 is
 going
 viral.


>> Uh
 barges.


>> This
 is
 an
 after
 school
 special
 except


>> I've
 decided
 I'm
 going
 to
 base
 my
 entire


personality
 going
 forward
 on
 campaigning


for
 a
 strategic
 pork
 reserve
 in
 the
 US.


>> Black
 gold.


>> These
 are
 the
 the
 important
 questions.


Is
 it
 robots
 taking
 over
 the
 world?


>> No,
 I
 think
 that
 like
 in
 a
 couple
 years


the
 AI
 will
 do
 a
 really
 good
 job
 of


making
 the
 OddLots
 podcast.
 One
 day
 that


person
 will
 have
 the
 mandate
 of
 heaven.


How
 do
 I
 get
 more
 popular
 and


successful?


>> We
 do
 have


>> the
 perfect
 guest.


>> Welcome
 to
 Lots
 More,
 where
 we
 catch
 up


with
 friends
 about
 what's
 going
 on
 right


now.


>> Because
 even
 when
 OddLots
 is
 over,


there's
 always
 lots
 more.


>> And
 we
 really
 do
 have
 the
 perfect
 guest.


>> I
 think
 we've
 been
 lying
 to
 our


listeners
 and
 our
 viewers.


>> Go
 on.
 This
 is
 intriguing.


>> We
 keep
 saying
 the
 Fed
 is
 raising
 or


lowering
 interest
 rates.


>> Yeah.
 Oh,
 I
 like
 this.
 I
 see.
 I
 already


see
 where
 you're
 going
 with
 this.


>> But
 actually,
 there's
 this
 whole


constellation
 of
 rates
 and
 we
 never


really
 specify
 which
 one.


>> It's
 less
 of
 a
 lie
 and
 more
 of
 an


omission
 etc.
 It
 is
 true,
 especially
 at


the
 short-term
 level
 that
 they're
 all


these
 different
 rates
 and
 they
 sort
 of


get
 abstracted
 away
 because
 I
 guess
 they


can
 be
 arbed
 one
 way
 if
 there's
 between


the
 two
 if
 they
 ever
 deviate.
 So
 the
 Fed


can
 influence
 these
 other
 rates
 and


obviously
 generally
 strongly
 does
 but


it's
 no
 guarantee
 that
 all
 these


short-term
 rates
 always
 converge


identically.


>> No.
 And
 we
 have
 seen
 for
 instance


instances
 where
 the
 market
 rates
 have


gone
 far
 far
 outside
 what
 the
 Fed
 is


actually
 targeting.
 So
 I
 should
 just
 say


when
 the
 Fed
 raises
 or
 lowers
 interest


rates
 it
 does
 it
 through
 well
 it
 targets


the
 Fed
 funds
 rate.
 Okay?
 And
 I
 think


everyone
 has
 heard
 of
 that.
 But
 the
 way


it
 mechanically
 does
 it
 has
 changed
 over


time.
 In
 fact,
 it
 changed
 in
 a
 pretty


big
 way
 early
 on
 in
 our
 financial


journalistic
 careers.
 So,
 we
 should


definitely
 talk
 about
 it.
 Who's
 the
 guy


that
 we
 call
 when
 we
 want
 to
 talk
 money


markets
 and
 mechanics
 of
 interest
 rates?


>> Go
 on.


>> It's
 Joe
 Abate.


>> I'm
 really
 excited.
 Let's
 do
 it.


>> Joe
 has
 actually
 left
 Barclays
 after


more
 than
 28
 years
 and
 he's
 now
 at
 SMBC


Nico.
 He's
 head
 of
 macro
 strategy.
 So,


we're
 looking
 forward
 to
 uh
 hearing
 even


more
 from
 him.
 Uh
 Joe,
 talk
 to
 us
 about


how
 the
 actual
 mechanics
 of
 raising


changing
 rates
 has
 changed
 over
 time.
 So


originally
 the
 Fed
 started
 with
 a
 scarce


reserve
 regime
 and
 the
 idea
 was
 that
 the


level
 of
 liquidity
 in
 the
 system
 was


always
 kept
 a
 little
 bit
 short
 of
 what


banks
 really
 wanted
 to
 hold
 and
 that


created
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 torque
 in
 this


interbank
 market,
 the
 Fed
 funds
 market.


And
 that
 allowed
 the
 Fed
 to
 move
 the
 Fed


funds
 rate
 to
 exactly
 where
 it
 wanted
 to


set
 the
 target.
 and
 the
 target
 was
 set


at
 a
 pinpoint
 level
 of
 interest
 rates.


Over
 time,
 and
 certainly
 beginning
 in


about
 2008,
 the
 Fed
 shifted
 to
 a


different
 format.
 And
 in
 that
 format,


the
 Fed
 would
 supply
 an
 ample
 or


abundant
 level
 of
 reserves
 and
 let
 the


Fed
 funds
 rate,
 you
 know,
 trade
 or
 at


least
 in
 this
 case
 not
 trade
 at
 some


spread
 or
 band
 between
 an
 upper
 and


lower
 band
 where
 it
 set
 the
 target.
 And


originally,
 it
 set
 the
 target
 range
 band


because
 it
 wasn't
 confident
 that
 this


new
 structure
 would
 keep
 the
 Fed
 funds


rate
 close
 to
 a
 pinpoint
 level.
 But
 if


you
 supply
 an
 abundant
 level
 of
 reserves


into
 the
 system,
 what
 happens
 is
 the
 Fed


funds
 market
 changes
 fundamentally.


>> It
 adapts.


>> It
 adapts.
 And
 as
 it
 adapted,
 what


happened
 was
 banks
 stopped
 trading
 in


the
 Fed
 funds
 market.
 They
 didn't
 need


to
 borrow
 reserves
 anymore


>> because
 there
 were
 plenty
 there.


>> Because
 there
 were
 plenty.
 Exactly.


>> So
 the
 market
 kind
 of
 devolved
 into


basically
 an
 interest
 rate
 arbitrage.


You
 have
 one
 set
 of
 borrowers
 and
 one


set
 of
 lenders.
 The
 borrowers
 in
 this


market
 are
 generally
 non
 US
 banks
 and


the
 lenders
 are
 the
 home
 loan
 banks.
 And


the
 reason
 there's
 this
 distinction
 is


because
 the
 home
 loan
 banks
 can't
 earn


interest
 on
 their
 reserve
 on
 their
 cash


balances
 at
 the
 Fed.
 So
 they
 have
 an


incentive
 to
 sell
 their
 cash
 right
 into


the
 Fed
 funds
 market
 to
 non
 US
 banks
 who


are
 simply
 making
 the
 spread
 between
 Fed


funds
 and
 IRB
 and
 in
 an
 ample
 reserve


>> IRB
 oh
 interest
 on
 reserves
 okay


>> reserve
 balances
 and
 that
 spread
 has


been
 very
 very
 stable
 for
 the
 last


probably
 four
 years
 or
 so
 at
 minus
 minus


seven
 basis
 points
 because
 the
 Fed's


been
 operating
 in
 an
 abundant
 reserve


regime.
 The
 abundant
 reserve
 regime


first
 came
 about
 because
 of
 QE,
 right?


So,
 you
 expanded
 the
 Fed's
 balance


sheet,
 created
 all
 these
 reserves,
 so


banks
 were
 oversted
 with
 liquidity.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 a
 question
 that's
 going


to
 sound
 very
 negative,
 but
 it's
 not.


It's
 actually
 I
 mean
 it
 very
 literally


because
 I
 think
 this
 might
 help
 us


understand
 why
 we're
 having
 this


conversation.
 Who
 cares?


Who
 cares
 about
 the


>> any
 of
 this?
 And
 I
 do
 and
 again
 I
 do
 not


mean
 this
 in
 like
 a
 dismissive
 way.
 I


mean
 all
 of
 these
 things
 like
 these


short-term
 things
 that
 basically
 are


equivalent.
 They
 could
 be
 armed
 away.


The
 Fed
 seems
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 control


over
 these
 markets.
 In
 the
 end,
 even
 if


it's
 not
 targeting
 one
 or
 the
 other,
 the


short-term
 interest
 rate
 is
 basically


where
 the
 Fed
 wants
 it
 by
 any
 of
 these


measures.
 So
 literally,
 who
 cares
 about


the
 plumbing?
 So
 the
 reason
 you
 I
 think


care
 about
 the
 plumbing
 is
 that
 the
 Fed


uses
 it
 to
 communicate
 its
 policy


intentions.
 So
 it
 needs
 some
 sort
 of


barometer,
 some
 sort
 of
 measure
 for
 the


market
 to
 be
 able
 to
 interpret
 what
 the


Fed's
 intentions
 are.
 So
 there's
 a


two-fold


implication,
 if
 you
 will,
 for
 the
 Fed


funds
 market.
 One
 is
 the
 Fed
 uses
 the


Fed
 funds
 rate
 to
 communicate
 its
 policy


intentions.
 So
 raising
 rates,
 lowering


rates,
 and
 it
 uses
 the
 dot
 plot,
 for


example,
 defined
 as
 the
 Fed
 funds
 rate


to
 provide
 forward
 guidance
 to
 tell
 the


market
 how
 far
 we're
 going
 or
 what
 we


see
 as
 the
 endgame
 potentially
 for


interest
 rates.


>> And
 the
 second
 element
 is
 kind
 of
 more


of
 a
 mechanical
 one,
 which
 you're


referring
 to
 as
 the
 plumbing.
 Yeah.


which
 is
 how
 does
 the
 Fed's
 intentions


get
 translated
 into
 bank
 deposit
 rates,


mortgage
 rates,
 etc.


>> Right?
 And
 one
 way
 to
 think
 about
 this


is
 that
 all
 of
 these
 term
 interest


rates,
 tenure
 yields,
 etc.
 are
 all
 a


reflection
 of
 what
 your
 expected
 path
 of


the
 Fed
 is,


>> right?
 Defined
 as
 Fed
 funds
 plus
 some


premium,
 right,
 to
 reflect
 the
 term
 risk


that
 you're
 taking
 or
 inflation
 risk,


etc.
 And
 therefore
 there's
 a
 linkage


between
 the
 overnight
 rates,
 the


communication
 of
 policy
 and
 how
 it's


transmitted
 to
 the
 broader
 financial


market
 system.


>> I
 do
 think
 in
 terms
 of
 signaling
 the


central
 bank's
 actions,
 it
 is
 kind
 of


funny
 that
 you
 know
 we're
 so
 used
 to


thinking
 of
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 as
 a


very
 targeted
 institution,
 but
 when


we're
 talking
 about
 reserves,
 the


language
 they
 use
 is
 like
 excess


abundant
 apple.
 And
 there's
 no
 hardcore


definitions
 of
 what
 those
 actually
 are.


But
 I
 should
 just
 say
 the
 reason
 we
 are


talking
 about
 this
 is
 because
 everyone


in
 money
 markets
 is
 talking
 about
 this


right
 now
 because
 Lori
 Logan
 at
 the


Dallas
 Fed,
 she
 did
 a
 speech
 last
 week


and
 a
 paper
 I
 think
 basically
 saying


that
 the
 US,
 the
 Fed
 should
 move
 away


from
 targeting
 Fed
 funds
 and
 look
 at


some
 different
 ways
 of
 targeting
 rates


basically.
 Was
 that
 a
 surprise
 to
 you


when
 you
 read
 the
 speech?


>> It
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 surprise
 since


we
 didn't
 really
 think
 that
 the
 Fed
 was


preparing
 to
 actually
 change
 policy


rates,
 but
 the
 overall
 reasons
 for
 why


they
 might
 have
 to
 move
 away
 from
 a
 Fed


funds
 target
 are
 pretty
 well
 known.
 So


again,
 as
 I
 described
 the
 Fed
 funds


market
 earlier,
 right,
 you've
 got
 one


set
 of
 borrowers,
 one
 set
 of
 lenders.


It's
 become
 kind
 of
 a
 Roman
 lake,
 right?


The
 provinces
 around
 the
 Mediterranean


all
 spoke
 Latin.
 So
 in
 effect,
 right,


there's
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 activity
 going
 on


between
 the
 Fed
 funds
 market
 or
 the


reason
 to
 borrow.
 So
 it
 just
 becomes
 a


communications
 device.
 So
 if
 you
 move
 to


a
 different
 barometer,
 let's
 say
 a


triparty
 repo
 rate,
 and
 we
 can
 go
 into


details
 about
 what
 exactly
 that
 means.


So,
 one
 that
 would
 be
 based
 on
 an
 active


market,


>> correct?
 You
 would
 get
 not
 only
 the


communications
 element,
 but
 you'd
 also


get
 a
 feedback
 on
 how
 well
 the
 Fed
 is


doing
 in
 managing
 liquidity.


>> Now,
 if
 reserves
 are
 always
 abundant,
 I


don't
 really
 need
 that
 information,


right?
 I
 know
 that
 reserves
 are


abundant,
 but
 if
 I
 want
 to
 run
 an


efficient
 balance
 sheet
 for
 the
 Fed,
 in


other
 words,
 one
 that's
 not
 any
 larger


than
 it
 needs
 to
 be
 to
 control
 interest


rates,
 then
 I
 have
 to
 kind
 of
 bring
 down


the
 level
 of
 reserves
 in
 the
 system
 and


monitor
 as
 I
 bring
 down
 the
 level
 of


reserves,
 what's
 happening
 with


liquidity
 in
 the
 overall
 system.
 Is
 it,


as
 you
 said,
 is
 it
 staying
 within
 the


bands
 or
 is
 it
 moving
 outside
 those


bands?
 and
 creating
 other
 sorts
 of


distortions
 and
 that's
 why
 I
 need


hopefully
 a
 market
 traded
 instrument
 and


that
 would
 be
 in
 this
 case
 the
 repo


rate.


>> What
 is
 the
 cost
 of
 running
 an


inefficient
 balance
 sheet
 or
 a
 balance


sheet
 that
 has
 more
 reserves
 than
 are


theoretically
 necessary?
 Like
 okay,


what's
 so
 bad
 about
 that?


>> You're
 very
 existential
 to
 me.


>> No,
 for
 real.
 Like
 I've
 heard
 this


before.
 They
 want
 to
 get
 it
 right.
 But


like
 from
 an
 actual
 when
 we
 think
 about


the
 Fed's
 goals,
 right,
 which
 is


ultimately,
 and
 you
 described
 it,
 it's


about
 transmitting
 policy,
 these
 dual


mandates
 and
 all
 this
 stuff.
 What
 is
 the


cost
 from
 the
 Fed's
 purpose?
 It's
 razone


debt
 of
 running
 a
 having
 a
 few
 extra
 of


these
 tokens
 in
 the
 system.


>> Why
 are
 we
 here,
 Joe?
 Yeah,


>> Joe
 one.


>> Well,
 no,
 cuz
 like
 Yeah.
 No,
 because
 if


we
 need
 to
 switch
 to
 X
 because
 we
 want


to
 get
 a
 better
 read
 on
 the
 efficiency


of
 our
 balance
 sheet,
 that
 implies
 that


balance
 sheet
 efficiency
 is
 an
 important


thing.


>> So,
 I
 agree
 with
 you.
 I'm
 personally


not
 opposed
 to
 a
 big
 balance
 sheet.
 I


would
 argue
 that
 having
 plenty
 of


reserves
 in
 the
 system
 increases
 the


safety
 of
 banks,
 right?
 They
 have
 more


liquidity.
 that
 particular
 type
 of


liquidity
 is
 immediately
 available,


right?
 Because
 bank
 reserves
 can
 be


accessed
 a
 immediately
 whereas


monetizing
 treasuries
 requires
 either


repoing
 them,
 going
 to
 the
 discount


window
 or
 selling
 them
 in
 the
 market.
 So


ample
 is
 probably


where
 you
 should
 be
 targeting.
 An


inefficient
 balance
 sheet
 would
 be
 one


where
 you
 could
 argue
 that
 banks
 are


overstocked
 with
 reserves.
 And
 because


they're
 overstocked
 with
 reserves,


the
 cost
 of
 those
 reserves
 for
 them
 is


low.
 And
 anything
 that's
 low


in
 price,
 you
 have
 an
 incentive
 to
 hold


more
 than
 you
 probably
 need.
 So
 from
 an


efficiency
 argument,
 you
 might
 argue


that
 banks
 because
 they've
 been
 over


supplied
 with
 bank
 reserves,
 their


demand
 for
 those
 reserves
 is
 excessive


and
 they
 should
 be
 holding,
 you
 know,


kind
 of
 more
 treasuries
 and
 other


assets.
 The
 other
 example
 of
 this
 is
 if


you
 have
 a
 bloated
 Federal
 Reserve


balance
 sheet,
 right,
 during,
 for


example,
 QE,
 right,
 you
 create
 other


sorts
 of
 distortions
 in
 the
 market.
 So


during
 QE
 what
 we
 saw
 was
 that
 bank


demand
 for
 loans
 or
 loan
 demand
 was
 weak


right
 and
 the
 Fed
 was
 pushing
 all
 these


reserves
 into
 the
 system.
 Banks
 ended
 up


with
 lots
 and
 lots
 of
 deposits.
 These


deposits
 were
 uninsured
 right
 and
 they


were
 very
 rate
 sensitive
 so
 that
 when


the
 Fed
 began
 raising
 interest
 rates


that
 cash
 left


>> very
 quickly
 as
 in
 March
 of
 23.
 Mhm.


>> At
 the
 same
 time,
 the
 cash
 on
 their


balance
 sheet
 was
 crowding
 out
 their


fixed
 amount
 of
 capital,
 right?
 So,
 you


were
 basically
 holding
 more
 cash
 than


you
 wanted
 to
 and
 you
 were
 rolling
 it


into
 securities
 because
 loan
 demand


wasn't
 there.
 And
 so
 you
 had
 a
 balance


sheet
 that
 became
 more
 heavily
 skewed


toward
 this
 is
 the
 banks
 skewed
 toward


treasuries,


lots
 of
 cash
 and
 more
 flightprone


liabilities.
 So
 when
 the
 Fed
 began


raising
 interest
 rates,


>> everything


>> became
 unglued
 or
 became
 more
 volatile.


There
 was
 also
 I
 think
 a
 populist


component
 for
 a
 time
 where
 people
 used


to
 get
 upset
 that
 like
 the
 foreign
 banks


were
 earning
 lots
 of
 interest
 on
 their


reserves
 and
 things
 like
 that.
 Do
 you


remember?
 I


>> I
 do.
 I
 actually
 remember
 even
 earlier


than
 that
 where
 there
 was
 work
 done


about
 who
 was
 benefiting
 from
 the


liquidity
 programs
 in
 the
 financial


crisis.
 And
 there
 were
 in
 fact
 some
 news


agencies
 filing
 Freedom
 of
 Information


Act
 requests
 to
 find
 out
 exactly
 who


used
 what
 facility
 and
 how
 much.


[Music]


Okay,
 I
 have
 to
 ask
 why
 the
 trip
 party


rate
 and
 not
 something
 like
 sofur,
 the


secured
 overnight
 financing
 rate,
 which


I
 thought,
 you
 know,
 that's
 supposed
 to


be
 the
 de
 facto
 benchmark
 money
 market


rate,
 the
 one
 that
 replaced
 Liebore.


>> That's
 right.
 I
 think
 the
 main


distinction
 is
 because
 the
 triparty
 rate


or
 the
 triparty
 market
 itself
 is
 a
 pure


financing
 market.
 It's
 the
 market
 in


which
 the
 dealer
 community
 is
 raising


cash
 from
 cash
 providers
 like
 money


market
 funds.
 By
 contrast,
 sofur
 is
 a


little
 bit
 broader
 because
 it
 includes


the
 bilateral
 repo
 market.
 And
 because


it
 includes
 the
 bilateral
 repo
 market,


that's
 more
 of
 a
 market
 where
 people
 are


looking
 for
 financing
 as
 well
 as


specific
 QIPS
 or
 specific
 treasury


securities.
 So
 they
 may
 have
 the
 left


shoe,
 but
 they're
 looking
 for
 the
 right


shoe,


>> right?


>> And
 because
 of
 that,
 you
 basically
 have


two
 different
 equilibria
 in
 the
 market.


You
 have
 a
 triparty
 equilibrium
 and
 then


you
 have
 a
 sofur
 bilateral
 equilibrium.


And
 what
 Lori
 Logan
 was
 arguing
 is
 that


that
 creates
 kind
 of
 a
 bifurcated


distribution
 where
 the
 incentives
 to


trade
 in
 one
 market
 may
 not
 be
 the
 same


as
 in
 the
 other
 more
 smaller
 triparty


market.
 The
 result
 is
 that
 you
 may
 be,


you
 know,
 looking
 at
 a
 at
 an
 an
 average


or
 a
 volume
 weighted
 median
 across
 all


of
 these
 markets.
 that
 doesn't
 actually


reflect
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 market.


>> So
 what
 is
 the
 prospect
 of
 something


fundamental
 changing
 and
 what
 the
 Fed


targets?
 Okay,
 Lori
 Logan
 gives
 a


speech,
 but
 that's
 just
 a
 speech.
 And


then
 if
 there
 were
 going
 to
 be
 some


change
 in
 what
 instrument
 or
 what


measure
 the
 Fed
 targets,
 you
 know,
 what


are
 the
 technical
 challenges
 with
 the


new
 implementation?


>> So
 the
 short
 answer
 to
 that
 is
 I
 don't


know.
 What
 I
 would
 say
 is
 that
 my
 sense


is
 that
 it's
 probably
 sooner
 than
 people


think.
 Lori
 Logan
 is
 given
 her
 past


career
 at
 the
 New
 York
 Fed
 and
 the
 SOM


or
 the,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of
 the


implementation
 desk
 at
 the
 Fed
 probably


has
 a
 lot
 of
 weight
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 the


mechanics
 of
 monetary
 policy
 run.
 As
 far


as
 the
 other
 members
 of
 the
 FOMC,
 I'm


not
 sure
 what
 their
 opinions
 are
 because


nobody's
 really
 discussed
 this
 in
 the


past.
 So
 I
 would
 say
 that
 probably


sooner
 rather
 than
 later,
 but
 something


that's
 not
 going
 to
 happen,
 you
 know,


let's
 say
 within
 the
 next
 two
 years.


>> Okay.


>> Mechanically,
 you
 know,
 there
 have
 been


certainly
 in
 my
 career,
 the
 Fed
 has,


you
 know,
 targeted
 the
 Fed
 funds
 rate


for
 the
 entire
 period
 of
 time,
 but
 the


way
 it
 communicates
 what
 it's
 targeting


has
 changed.
 So
 when
 I
 started
 the
 Fed


used
 to
 do
 daily
 operations


and
 what
 kind
 of
 daily
 liquidity


operation
 there
 were
 fine
 distinctions


between
 them
 that
 would
 indicate
 how


much
 the
 Fed
 was
 expecting
 the
 Fed
 funds


rate
 to
 move
 up
 or
 down.
 Then
 in
 94
 you


know
 they
 basically
 came
 out
 and
 said


that
 we're
 going
 to
 target
 the
 rate


itself.
 Mhm.


>> And
 then
 after
 that
 in
 I
 think
 it
 was


'95
 they
 actually
 started
 publishing
 the


target
 rate
 in
 the
 FOMC
 minutes


>> because
 it
 used
 to
 just
 be
 you
 had
 to


you
 would
 just
 intuitive
 right
 it
 would


just
 it
 would
 arrive
 there
 and
 then
 they


would
 figure
 out
 what
 the
 target
 was.


Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 They
 used
 to
 use
 expressions
 like


expected
 to
 put
 modest
 pressure
 on


reserve
 conditions
 or


>> because
 the
 Fed
 has
 such
 a
 track
 record


of
 successfully
 targeting
 a
 rate.
 Has


that
 reduced
 the
 pressure
 to
 actually


trade
 in
 the
 market
 because
 the
 word
 is


so
 good?


>> Uh
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 no.
 I
 I
 think
 that


the
 reason
 there's
 no
 trading
 in
 the
 Fed


funds
 market
 partly,
 as
 I
 said
 earlier,


is
 that
 you
 know
 because
 it's
 a
 Roman


lake
 of
 sorts.
 It's
 kind
 of
 a
 negotiated


interest
 rate.
 It's
 not
 really
 a
 traded


rate.
 But
 I
 mean
 the
 what
 I
 meant
 is


like
 does
 the
 Fed
 does
 it
 not
 need
 to


intervene
 directly
 as
 much
 the
 way
 it


did
 in
 the
 old
 days
 because
 everybody


knows
 that
 it
 can
 achieve
 it
 and
 so
 the


market
 will
 take
 care
 of
 any
 deviations.


>> Yes,
 I
 think
 that's
 partly
 true.
 I
 think


that


you
 know
 that
 was
 originally
 the
 reason


why
 they
 had
 a
 band
 around
 the
 target


because
 they
 weren't
 sure
 in
 2008
 that


they
 could
 achieve
 that.
 in
 the


subsequent
 years.
 Yes,
 they've
 kind
 of


eliminated
 the
 fine-tuning
 that
 they


would
 need
 to
 do
 to
 get
 the
 Fed
 funds


rate
 to
 the
 target.


>> Okay.
 On
 the
 topic
 of
 nebulous
 Fed
 words


though,
 whether
 it's
 modest
 or
 something


like
 ample,
 reserves
 in
 the
 system
 are


still
 ample,
 but
 they
 are
 also
 falling.


And
 meanwhile,
 we've
 seen
 some
 repo


rates
 going
 up
 recently.
 Uh
 we
 had
 the


September
 15th
 tax
 day.
 I
 guess


September
 30th
 quarter
 end.
 There
 was
 a


lot
 of
 concern
 that
 we
 might
 get,
 you


know,
 some
 sort
 of
 repo
 apocalypse
 as
 we


used
 to
 call
 it.
 That
 hasn't
 really


materialized.
 But
 would
 you
 say
 overall


the
 price
 of
 liquidity
 is
 going
 up?


>> Yes,
 I
 totally
 agree
 with
 that.
 So


reserves
 may
 be
 ample
 at
 the
 moment
 but


their
 price
 is
 going
 up
 because
 the


amount
 of
 that
 ampleness
 is
 getting


smaller
 and
 smaller
 and
 there
 are


variety
 of
 reasons
 why
 it's
 getting


smaller
 and
 smaller.
 One
 of
 them
 is
 QT


the
 other
 was
 the
 resolution
 of
 the
 debt


ceiling
 which
 you
 know
 encouraged
 the


Treasury
 to
 kind
 of
 target
 a
 higher
 cash


balance
 for
 precautionary
 reasons.
 There


was
 a
 speech
 recently
 by
 Hunter
 McMaster


about
 what
 the
 Treasury's
 cash
 balance


target
 or
 goal
 or
 desired
 level
 is,


which
 is
 5
 to
 7
 days
 of
 expected


outflows.
 And
 so
 they
 want
 to
 maintain


an
 ample
 balance
 in
 their
 checking


account,
 but
 the
 Treasury's
 checking


account
 is
 held
 at
 the
 Federal
 Reserve,


and
 that
 acts
 as
 a
 liability
 for
 the


Fed,
 so
 it
 drains
 reserves
 as
 the


balance
 goes
 up.
 So
 all
 of
 these
 factors


have
 kind
 of
 been
 moving
 and
 up
 until


now
 most
 of
 the
 decline
 in
 the
 Fed's


balance
 sheet
 has
 shown
 up
 as
 a
 shift


out
 of
 the
 reverse
 repo
 program
 which
 is


meant
 to
 mop
 up
 excess
 reserves
 and
 the


treasury's
 account.
 Now
 what's
 happening


is
 that
 there's
 nothing
 left
 in
 the
 RRP


program
 and
 as
 the
 balance
 sheet
 shrinks


further
 it
 comes
 out
 of
 reserves.
 as
 it


comes
 out
 of
 reserves,
 the
 effect
 is


kind
 of
 disproportionate,
 if
 you
 will.


Most
 of
 the
 reserve
 loss
 that
 we've
 seen


has
 come
 from
 foreign
 banks.
 Foreign


banks
 are
 the
 ones
 who
 are
 trading
 in


the
 Fed
 funds
 market.
 So,
 their
 cost
 of


liquidity
 is
 going
 up,
 right?
 Their


bargaining
 power
 in
 this,
 you
 know,


negotiation
 has
 deteriorated
 and
 they


have
 to
 pay
 an
 extra
 basis
 point
 and


that's
 what
 we've
 seen
 in
 recent
 days.


>> Last
 question
 for
 me.
 you
 seen
 any


interesting
 have
 any
 interesting


thoughts
 these
 days
 about
 stable
 coins


or
 how
 that
 interacts
 with
 some
 of
 these


markets?
 So
 the
 idea
 behind
 the
 stable


coins
 is
 as
 a
 payment
 mechanism,
 right?


That
 they
 look
 similar
 to
 a
 money
 market


fund
 and
 because
 they're
 similar
 in


structure
 to
 a
 money
 market
 fund,
 the


idea
 is
 that
 they
 would
 have
 to
 buy


short
 duration
 assets,
 right?
 They'd


have
 to
 buy
 Treasury
 repo,
 they'd
 have


to
 buy
 Treasury
 bills.
 So
 the
 goal
 or


the
 intent
 is
 that
 if
 demand
 for
 stable


coins
 goes
 up,
 the
 demand
 for
 bills
 will


go
 up
 and
 therefore
 the
 treasury
 will


find
 a
 new
 buyer
 for
 treasury
 bills
 and


it
 could
 issue
 more
 treasury
 bills


without
 pushing
 interest
 rates
 up,


right?
 And
 if
 your
 goal
 hypothetically


is
 to


increase
 bill
 supply
 but
 reduce
 the


supply
 of
 term
 debt
 in
 order
 to
 keep


term
 interest
 rates
 from
 rising.
 Yeah.


>> Then
 you
 need
 a
 new
 large
 buyer
 of


treasury
 bills,
 right?
 That
 buyer


theoretically
 could
 be
 stable
 coins
 or


at least
 a
 payment
 token
 of
 some
 sort.


The
 problem
 of
 course
 is
 that
 when
 the


demand
 for
 payment
 tokens
 goes
 up,
 it's


taking
 away
 from
 the
 demand
 other


>> other
 instruments
 that
 people
 use
 for


making
 payments.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 Deposits,


>> right?


>> Credit
 cards
 and
 paper
 currency.


So
 my
 sense
 at
 least
 from
 looking
 at


this
 and
 having
 thought
 about
 it


somewhat
 is
 I
 think
 of
 the
 payment


tokens
 as
 a
 closer
 substitute
 for


currency
 than
 a


you
 know
 than
 a
 bank
 deposit.


If
 you
 think
 about
 currency
 generally,


right,
 there's
 I
 think
 the
 average


onperson
 currency


amount
 is
 about
 $60,
 but
 per
 capita


currency
 in
 the
 US
 is
 something
 like


$7,000
 or
 more.
 So
 there's
 a
 significant


volume
 of
 US
 currency
 that's
 held


offshore,
 right?
 Some
 estimates
 between


58
 58
 of
 US
 currency
 is
 held
 offshore.


There
 are
 19
 billion
 $100
 bills
 out


there.


>> 19
 billion
 $100
 bills?


>> Yes.


>> So,


>> I
 have
 none
 of
 them.


>> No,
 I
 have
 a
 few.


>> Oh,
 really?


>> Yeah.
 From
 the
 last
 time
 I
 played
 poker.


>> Do
 you
 keep
 them
 in
 your
 wallet?


>> I
 have
 them
 in
 my
 bedside
 drawer.


>> So,
 you're
 part
 of
 the
 exception
 rather


than
 the
 rule.
 But
 my
 point
 being
 that
 a


payment
 token
 probably
 the
 demand
 for
 it


may
 be
 higher
 outside
 the
 US
 than
 inside


the
 US
 because
 you
 have
 all
 lots
 of
 ways


of
 making
 fast
 payments.
 Where
 it
 might


be
 more
 attractive
 is
 in
 underbanked


economies
 that
 are
 able
 to
 access
 mobile


phones.
 And
 so
 all
 things
 being
 equal,


you
 could
 say
 it
 is
 a
 substitute
 for
 the


$100
 bill
 as
 a
 store
 of
 value
 and
 a
 unit


of
 account.
 And
 in
 that
 case
 then
 you


could
 potentially
 see
 strong
 demand
 for


payment
 tokens
 but
 they
 would
 be
 located


outside
 the
 US.
 The
 other
 area
 would
 be


with
 respect
 to
 remittances.
 Right.


>> Right.
 So
 sending
 money
 abroad.
 Again


much
 easier
 to
 do
 with
 a
 payment
 token.


Making
 purchases
 theoretically
 using


your
 credit
 card
 and
 a
 non
 US
 currency


sometimes


can
 get
 hard
 partly
 because
 of


anti-fraud
 and
 other
 uh
 mechanisms.
 If


you
 used
 a
 stable
 coin,
 that
 might
 be


easier.
 But
 the
 problem,
 of
 course,
 is


that
 a
 stable
 coin
 used
 in
 that
 way
 is


just
 like
 using
 money,
 right?
 Or
 paper


money,
 right?
 Once
 it's
 gone,


>> right?


>> You
 can't
 call
 your
 credit
 card
 company


and
 say,
 "Stop
 that
 payment."


I'm
 going
 to
 squeeze
 in
 one
 more


question
 on
 swap
 spreads,
 which
 was


actually
 the
 original
 reason
 why
 I


reached
 out
 to
 you,
 but
 then
 Lori
 Logan


made
 her
 speech
 and
 we
 got
 very


distracted.
 But
 swap
 spreads,
 there's


something
 going
 on
 there,
 which
 is
 they


seem
 to
 be
 widening,
 not
 just
 in
 the
 US,


but
 basically
 all
 around
 the
 world.
 So,


Australia,
 Japan,
 Canada,
 I
 think.
 What


is
 going
 on
 there?
 And
 why
 should
 we


care
 about
 swap
 spreads?
 So,
 I'm
 not
 an


expert
 on
 swap
 spreads,
 but
 I
 will
 say


is
 that
 there's
 a
 general
 global
 theme


about
 fiscal
 prudence,
 if
 you
 will,
 and


that
 the
 amount
 of
 government
 debt


outstanding
 is
 increasing
 and
 doesn't


seem
 to
 be
 going
 anywhere
 but
 up.
 The


result
 of
 that
 is
 that
 people
 demand
 a


premium
 for
 holding
 that
 government


debt.
 And
 that's
 what
 we're
 seeing
 here,


which
 is
 that
 that
 premium
 has
 started


to
 rise.
 Now
 initially
 in
 the
 US
 the


sense
 was
 that
 after
 the
 certainly
 in


April
 of
 this
 year
 that
 premium
 was


expected
 to
 be
 higher
 but
 I
 think
 what


happened
 in
 the
 US
 was
 that
 people


recognized
 that


the
 deterioration
 in
 the
 fiscal
 outlook


was
 not
 a
 uni
 a
 unique
 US
 phenomena


right
 it
 was
 occurring
 across
 the
 board


certainly
 in
 the
 countries
 among
 the


countries
 that
 you
 were
 mentioning.
 So
 I


think
 there's
 a


I
 don't
 want
 to
 call
 it
 bond


vigilanteism
 because
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 what's
 going
 on
 but
 there
 is
 a


realization
 that
 fiscal
 policy
 is
 moving


in
 presumably
 an
 unsustainable


direction.


>> Although
 weirdly
 the
 UK
 one
 hasn't
 moved


that
 much.


>> Yeah,
 I
 know.
 They
 got
 so
 much


excitement
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 September


and
 then
 it's
 uh
 it's
 been
 kind
 of


chill.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 we'll
 see
 what
 happens.
