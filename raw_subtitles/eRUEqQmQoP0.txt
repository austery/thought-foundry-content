Argentina has been burning through dollars like 
a gambler on borrowed time. In just seven trading  
sessions, its Treasury sold $1.8 billion 
dollars to defend the peso and maintain an  
exchange rate that markets expect to collapse the 
day after the midterm elections. Interest rates on  
short-term debt surged past 87% this week, and 
the central bank is running low on ammunition.  
The Argentine government is intervening in 
spot and futures markets, reinstating selective  
foreign-exchange controls, and clinging to a 
currency band that looks increasingly fictional.
 
President Javier Milei insists that the 
peso must hold—at least until October 26,  
when half of Congress is up for grabs. But 
the more dollars he throws at the problem,  
the more obvious it becomes that the current 
exchange rate is unsustainable. A U.S. Treasury  
pledge of support last month managed to calm 
markets but didn’t reverse the slump. Now,  
the U.S. has escalated its involvement.
On Thursday this week, Treasury Secretary  
Scott Bessent announced that the US Exchange 
Stabilization Fund, an emergency fund run by  
the US Treasury had directly purchased Argentine 
pesos. This is a very unusual move - the ESF has  
only intervened directly like this four times 
in the last thirty years – it’s most recent  
high-profile intervention was more than a decade 
ago and came as part of a G7 effort to control  
a spike in the yen after the Fukushima earthquake 
in Japan back in 2011. The ESF most famously lent  
$20 billion dollars to support Mexico after 
its currency collapsed in 1994. Mexico drew  
down $12 billion dollars of that twenty and 
eventually repaid the US with a profit.
 
Bessent also finalized a $20 billion currency 
swap framework with Argentina’s central bank,  
declaring Milei’s reform program 
to be “of systemic importance.”
 
The peso rebounded slightly on this 
announcement, and Argentina’s dollar  
bonds rallied. But the intervention has sparked 
bipartisan backlash in Washington. Critics on  
both sides of the aisle are asking whether this 
is in America’s interests. Republicans question  
whether it aligns with President Trump’s declared 
“America First” agenda – which is possibly being  
replaced with a - America First—unless Argentina 
needs twenty billion dollars and a hug agenda…
 
Democrats are probing whether hedge funds 
associated with Scott Bessent played a  
role in the deal and whether taxpayer dollars 
should be used to support a foreign president  
whose policies may be hurting American farmers.
When Javier Milei took office in December 2023,  
he brought a chainsaw to the office—both 
literally and metaphorically – but most  
importantly literally... The self-described 
libertarian economist promised to cut through  
decades of Peronist interventionism and 
restore Argentina’s economic credibility.  
His early moves were dramatic: he balanced 
the budget within a single quarter, cutting  
the deficit from 5% of GDP to zero. Inflation, 
which had been running at over 200% annually,  
began to fall sharply. By mid-2025, monthly 
inflation had dropped to around 2%, and the  
IMF was publicly praising his fiscal discipline.
One of Milei’s most tangible successes came in the  
housing market. In his first month in office, he 
repealed Argentina’s rent control laws—regulations  
that had distorted the rental sector, driving 
landlords out of the market, and leaving thousands  
of usable apartments vacant. The results 
were immediate. Listings on Argentina’s real  
estate platforms surged by 180%. Real (meaning 
inflation adjusted) rents fell, and long-term  
leases returned. The Cato Institute described it 
as a “textbook case” of deregulation improving  
outcomes for both tenants and landlords.
High inflation in Argentina had also – pretty  
much - halted home sales – as the extreme 
inflation meant that it made no sense for  
anyone to make any sort of long term loan 
– thus – you couldn’t borrow money to buy  
a house. Now that inflation has fallen, mortgages 
are back, and houses are once again transacting. 
 
Milei’s economic philosophy, which is rooted in 
free-market orthodoxy, stood in stark contrast  
to the populist statism of his predecessors. 
While his flamboyant style drew comparisons  
to Donald Trump, his policy agenda was more 
Milton Friedman than MAGA. He slashed tariffs,  
scrapped export taxes, and began privatizing 
state assets – this is pretty much the opposite  
of what Trump has been doing. For a country 
long mired in inflation, capital controls,  
and fiscal mismanagement, Milei’s early months 
offered a rare glimpse of coherent reform.

Milei initially campaigned on a policy  
of dollarization—a move that most economists 
considered unrealistic given Argentina’s lack  
of reserves – I made a video about that around 
the time of his election. He then pivoted to a  
strong peso strategy, believing that a stable 
currency would help tame inflation. While this  
approach did contribute to the decline in 
inflation, it created other distortions:  
it encouraged imports, discouraged exports, 
incentivized Argentinians to go on shopping  
sprees abroad, and drained Argentina’s foreign 
exchange reserves. The peso – which was once a  
symbol of Milei’s economic discipline, is 
now at the center of a growing crisis.
 
While Milei’s economic reforms have been 
bold, his political footing has been growing  
increasingly precarious. Three major scandals 
have damaged his credibility: his involvement  
in a meme coin scheme – I made a video about that 
in February - the accusations against his sister  
and chief of staff for taking kickbacks related to 
pharmaceutical sales, and the resignation of his  
lead congressional candidate José Luis Espert, who 
admitted to receiving payments from a businessman  
now under investigation for drug trafficking.
The political fallout came to a head last month,  
when Milei’s coalition suffered a stinging defeat 
in Buenos Aires Province—home to nearly 40% of  
Argentina’s electorate. While the region leans 
left and his candidates were not expected to win,  
the scale of the loss was worse than anticipated. 
Analysts interpreted this loss as a sign that  
voters are tiring of austerity and that 
corruption concerns are gaining traction.
 
Milei’s alliances with centrist opposition 
parties have frayed too. Argentina’s congress  
has already overturned one of his vetoes on 
a spending bill and is preparing to challenge  
three more. A new bill passed in the lower house 
would limit his ability to govern by decree,  
further constraining his capacity to 
push through reforms. The Economist  
notes that Milei’s ability to govern is now in 
question, and that his political strength—once  
rooted in popular support—is eroding.
With midterm elections approaching - later  
this month, Milei faces a critical test. Even 
a modest gain in congressional seats could  
help him block hostile legislation and shore up 
his reform agenda. But if the vote goes poorly,  
his ability to govern—and the durability of 
his economic program—could be in jeopardy.
 
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says 
the United States “stands ready to do  
what is needed” to support Argentina. 
That announcement helped calm markets,  
but it also raised eyebrows in Washington.
Behind the scenes, the bailout may be about  
more than Argentina. Washington’s support for 
Milei coincides with growing concern over China’s  
influence in South America. Argentina has an $18 
billion swap line with the People’s Bank of China,  
and Beijing has been deepening its trade ties 
across the region. Bessent has said Milei is  
“committed to getting China out of Argentina.”
The Trump administration has reportedly asked  
Argentina to reinstate export taxes on 
farm products—a move that would benefit  
U.S. agricultural interests but undermine Milei’s 
free-market agenda – and make it more difficult  
for Argentina to get the foreign exchange it needs 
to pay back its bondholders. Critics point out  
that it is unreasonable to blame countries like 
Argentina and Brazil for selling agricultural  
produce to China’s – replacing US producers 
– as it was the U.S. that started a trade war  
with its own farm sector’s best customers.
Scott Bessent told Fox news late on Thursday  
that this is not a bailout and that he thinks the 
peso is undervalued. Most economists disagree,  
saying the currency is too strong and hurting 
Argentina’s competitiveness. You also don’t need  
to spend billions of dollars supporting a currency 
that’s undervalued. The evidence of overvaluation  
is in plain sight - Bloomberg wrote an article 
earlier this week on how thousands of Argentinians  
are making trips to shopping malls across the 
border in Chile like it’s Black Friday at Best  
Buy - stuffing their cars with TV’s, laptops and 
clothes thanks to the peso’s new purchasing power.  
If your currency makes foreign electronics cheaper 
than buying rice at home, something may be off…
 
The Atlantic and FT Alphaville both suggest 
that the bailout is as much about geopolitics as  
economics. By backing Milei, the U.S. is not just 
supporting a reformer—it’s countering Beijing’s  
growing footprint in south America. But that 
strategy carries plenty of risks. If Milei fails,  
the U.S. will have spent billions defending a 
currency and a presidency that couldn’t hold.
 
Brad Setser of The Council on Foreign Relations 
told Bloomberg on Friday that this is “a gamble  
that all the problems that Argentina now faces 
are a function of politics, that Milei can pull  
a rabbit out of the hat and do better than 
expected in the October elections.” Bloomberg  
argue that - for Scott Bessent’s bet to pay off, 
a lot of things have to go right – things that in  
the past, have tended to go wrong in Argentina.
There’s a famous line in economics:  
that “there are four types of 
economies—developed, undeveloped,  
Japan, and Argentina.” And it’s impressive to get 
your own category in economics textbooks right  
next to ‘Japan’ and ‘don’t try this at home. 
But it might not be fun if you live there.
 
Argentina’s currency troubles are by no means 
unique. History offers a long list of failed  
attempts to support an artificially high 
exchange rate. The European Monetary System  
famously unraveled in 1992 when the UK was forced 
to exit the ERM under speculative pressure – I  
made a video on that a while back called “How 
George Soros Broke The Bank of England.”
 
Scott Bessent worked for Soros and helped 
break the Bank of England. Now he’s trying  
to un-break the Bank of Argentina. 
That’s what we call career range.
 
Thailand’s fixed exchange rate against the 
US dollar faced speculative attacks in 1997  
and the attempt to defend it depleted their 
foreign reserves. The government officially  
abandoned the fixed exchange rate on July 2, 
1997, triggering a major financial crisis.  
 
Mexico’s peso crisis in 1994 led to a $50 billion 
bailout coordinated by the U.S. and the IMF.
 
Each case followed a familiar pattern: a 
currency held artificially strong, reserves  
depleted defending it, and a sudden devaluation 
that shocked markets and citizens alike. 
 
Argentina has lived this cycle repeatedly. 
It has defaulted nine times since gaining  
independence in 1816 and is now the largest 
borrower from the IMF, accounting for more  
than a third of its global lending portfolio.
The IMF’s current program with Argentina includes  
a $20 billion Extended Fund Facility, with 
$12 billion dollars already disbursed. But the  
targets for reserve accumulation have already 
been missed, and the peso remains overvalued.  
The U.S. bailout via the ESF appears to lack the 
conditionality that helped Mexico recover in 1994.  
As Brad Setser wrote in the FT earlier this week - 
“Unconditional bailouts incentivize bad policy.”
 
Without a shift toward greater exchange 
rate flexibility and a sustainable  
path to rebuilding reserves, Argentina 
risks repeating the same mistakes. The  
peso band may hold through the election, but 
history suggests it won’t hold much longer.
 
Argentina’s economic history is littered 
with failed experiments—currency pegs,  
populist spending sprees, and reform programs 
that collapsed under political pressure. The  
current moment is worryingly familiar. Milei’s 
early successes have given way to mounting risks:  
a currency under siege, reserves running 
dry, and a reform agenda facing resistance  
from Congress and the electorate.
The IMF has already bent its own rules  
to keep the program alive. The U.S. Treasury is 
now deploying nearly all of its liquid reserves to  
back a bailout that lacks enforceable conditions. 
The peso remains overvalued. The reserve targets  
have been missed. And the political coalition 
needed to sustain reform is fraying.
 
Argentina’s - fixed-but-adjustable exchange rate 
system—where the peso trades within a band and  
the central bank intervenes at the edges—is 
inherently unstable and is inconsistent with  
Milei’s free-market philosophy. It creates 
perverse incentives, encourages speculation,  
and risks reserve depletion. Bloomberg estimates 
that defending the peso until election day could  
cost as much as $8 billion—an extraordinary sum 
for a country already running low on reserves.  
The U.S. Treasury’s intervention may have bought 
time, but it hasn’t changed the underlying math.
 
Defending an overvalued currency is not only 
economically unsound but politically dangerous  
too. Floating the peso would restore monetary 
autonomy, deter speculation, and signal confidence  
in Argentina’s fiscal consolidation – it would 
also boost the country’s ability to export and  
earn the foreign exchange needed to pay off its 
external debts. Unfortunately - with elections  
looming, the temptation to delay adjustment may 
prove irresistible. If history is any guide,  
the cost of waiting could be steep.
If Milei fails, the consequences will  
extend beyond Argentina. It will be a setback for 
market-oriented reformers across the region—and a  
cautionary tale for those who believe that 
ideology alone can stabilize an economy.  
Argentina is once again testing the limits 
of economic orthodoxy, political durability,  
and international patience. The graveyard of 
reforms may be about to gain another headstone.
