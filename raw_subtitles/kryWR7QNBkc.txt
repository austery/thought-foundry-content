I love negotiating.
I love negotiating.
Anyone else?
Four people!
(Laughter)
As women, we have a negotiation problem.
When we negotiate,
we are less likely than men are
to be successful
and we're at a higher risk of backlash.
This causes us to miss out
on opportunities,
earn less and frankly,
messes around with our mental well-being.
Fun, right?
We've all been there.
There's something you want to ask for.
So we stress about it for weeks.
We prepare, we take
all of the expert advice,
and yet it never feels like we're coming
from a position of strength.
What if I told you
that's because we've been given
the wrong advice our whole lives?
What if I told you there's another way,
a better way, a more authentic way,
designed especially for women,
that will make you much more likely
to get what you're asking for?
I want to share a story.
Ten years ago, I was an MBA intern
with an opportunity
at a Fortune 50 company,
a company that I had had
my eye on for years.
I was doing really well in the internship.
I actually finished my summer
project in under a month,
and I decided that my best bet
would be to negotiate
to be placed on another team
halfway through the summer,
because that's how, I thought,
twice as many people would vouch for me
and I would get that job.
So I made an appointment with the intern
coordinator for Monday morning,
and spent all weekend preparing
for one of the biggest
conversations of my life.
Monday morning arrives
and I walk into the coordinator's
office at 10 am sharp,
ready to negotiate,
just like the experts told me to.
I was creased, pleated
and pressed to perfection.
(Laughter)
By 10:05,
I had managed to accidentally
offend the coordinator.
By 10:10,
I was being told
I was no longer a "culture fit,"
which meant I wasn't getting that job.
As an added bonus, per company protocol,
I was then escorted out
of the building by security
and deposited on the sidewalk.
My head was spinning.
What just happened?
It turns out I had accidentally
violated the gender norms of negotiation
and derailed my career in less time
than it takes to get a latte.
That set me on a path to research
the role of gender in negotiations,
because I don't want
any other woman to be blindsided
by the secret impact gender has.
Why?
Because we continue
to use strategies built for men.
In fact, that's what
most expert advice is.
That's what I did,
and it earned me
a VIP seat on the sidewalk.
(Laughter)
Instead, you want to use
what's called a relational ask.
A relational ask is easily the most
well-hidden secret in negotiation.
Until now.
Research by Hannah Riley
Bowles out of Harvard
and Linda Babcock out of Carnegie Mellon
shows that when women
use a relational ask,
we are much more likely to be successful
and we actually
strengthen the relationship.
Research out of Georgetown shows
that this "virtually eliminates"
the risk of backlash.
That means that you can feel free to ask
for whatever it is you want,
and you don't have to worry
about all of those things
that maybe would have happened
because of your gender.
Like the nerd I am,
I have now reviewed 13,000 pages
of academic research on this topic,
and I used it to create
a formula you can use
to ask for what you want.
The formula is: past performance,
plus future vision,
plus the ask
and then a collaborative question.
This formula has been field-tested
by hundreds of women
over the past five years
to get promoted, make more money,
and craft careers they love.
Let me show you how it works.
Past performance is what
you've already done that matters.
Future vision is something
that everyone in the room wants.
The ask is what you want.
We're going to connect that to the vision.
And then a collaborative question
is really just how we get
out of our own ways.
Because after coaching women
on this for years,
what I found is that women
are so wonderful
that in order to avoid the possibility
of someone else feeling uncomfortable,
We'll negotiate against ourselves.
"But it's OK if it's not
in your budget this year."
Don't say that.
Instead, you want to use
what we call a collaborative question.
This formula means that it will take you
two minutes to create your ask,
using everything we know
about how to negotiate
successfully as a woman.
Maybe give you a few examples
of how this works, right?
So instead of saying,
"Hmm, I deserve to be promoted,"
you would use this formula
to say something like,
"As you know, I exceeded my sales
targets by 10 percent last year.
I think I can do it again this year,
but in order to do that,
I need the credibility that comes
with a director title.
What do you think?"
The woman who used those words
was successfully promoted.
Here's another one.
Instead of "I want to work less,"
you could use the formula
to say something like,
"As you know, I piloted a new
onboarding process this quarter
and it's getting great results.
We can roll it out
across the company next year,
but in order to do that,
I need to work the hours
when I'm most productive,
which is typically earlier in the day.
How can we make this work?"
That woman no longer works
late into the evenings.
Now, you might be thinking,
"This isn't fair.
I shouldn't have to deal
with gender bias at all."
You're right.
And we can wait for gender parity.
Estimates are it will only take 191 years.
(Laughter)
In the meantime,
there are 79 million women
who need tools to be successful, now.
Another one I've been hearing recently is,
"Well, won't AI fix this for me?"
I wish that were true.
And for a while, I thought it was.
Unfortunately, it turns out
AI's strength is in its ability
to gobble up huge amounts of information,
most of which on this particular topic
is what researchers call ...
Crap.
(Laughter)
Did you know that we make
35,000 decisions every day?
As women, so many of those decisions
are made to optimize for other people.
What does my boss need?
My team.
My kids.
But we only get this one life.
And you get to decide
what yours looks like.
Not your boss,
not your parents,
not your partner, not your kids.
You.
So let's ditch the bad advice
and instead use this formula
to ask for what you want in your life.
Share this with the other women
that you care about,
your family, your friends,
your classmates, your colleagues,
so that we can all have the tools we need
to negotiate a life we love.
Thank you.
(Applause)
