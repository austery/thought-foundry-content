Hi everyone, I'm Anthony.
Welcome to my channel
Today's video
Let's talk about a slightly heavy topic.
Why do those who pursue freedom...
Families that escape the system
Ultimately, this often creates new suffering for the child.
The reason I want to talk about this
Because of the two days ago
A female friend
She told me about her personal experience.
After obtaining her consent
I made her story into this video.
Share it
The girl's father
China's public education and culture
They hate both the political system and the political system.
They insisted on taking her away from the school.
Homeschooling
However
Compared to her previous situation in a public school
However, she fell into an increasingly severe depression.
I think this story is very typical.
In China we can see
There is a large group of highly educated people
Or rather, people with many ideas
Their views on China's education, culture, and system
With a strong critical attitude
I strongly agree with the values ​​of freedom, democracy, and openness.
They also often suffer from political depression.
then
They were determined to prevent their children from suffering from such pollution.
Some of the parents
Choosing to send your child to certain innovative schools
Other parents choose homeschooling
That is, educating children at home.
However their choice
Often fails to make children more mature and free.
Instead, it led to the child falling into more depression.
Pain and social impairment
This is undoubtedly a regrettable phenomenon.
This also reflects a rather profound issue.
and universal sociological laws
So this video
Let's explore and analyze this phenomenon.
I will upload this video.
Included in the list of "Psychology and Education"
If you have anything you'd like to discuss with me
And the topics of consultation
You can contact me via email to make an appointment.
So what happened to this friend?
She originally lived in a major city in China.
Attending a public high school
Junior High School
Originally, it was about a child establishing peer relationships.
The key stage in forming self-identity
But at that time
Her father
Intervening with an unquestionable air of authority.
Her father told her
Chinese schools are all brainwashing and mind control.
That kind of meaningless involution
You can't learn any real knowledge at all
Staying there is a waste of life
Under this narrative
She was forcibly taken away from school by her father.
At first her father sent her to
A local innovative school that prides itself on advanced concepts
But she didn't feel happy there.
On the contrary, it was that kind of interpersonal environment that caused more pain.
And this, ironically, became the father's...
Reasons for further tightening of controls
Eventually, she left that school.
He was taken home by his father and spent an extremely lonely time there.
It could even be described as several years of isolation from the world.
In these years
The father took over the role of God
He devised all sorts of ambitious learning plans for his daughter.
Accompanying
It was a complete colonization of her mind and social life.
She said: Her father spends several tens of minutes almost every day
Even longer
Intensive ideological indoctrination was carried out on her.
The content is roughly a critique of the darkness in Chinese society.
They mocked how stupid, idiotic, and brainwashing the education system is.
and repeated emphasis
How wicked and greedy the human heart can be.
Even more deadly is social distancing.
A teenager
I really need to interact with my peers.
Even just chatting about gossip
Playing games is also extremely meaningful.
But these things were absolutely forbidden in the father's eyes.
The father's logic is:
"Your peers have all been brainwashed by the system."
It's pointless to socialize with them.
"A complete waste of time"
He asked his daughter
To transcend age
Socializing with adults who are decades older than you
Learn from these people
You can imagine
A teenager
All normal social connections were cut off
Forced to navigate the adult circles approved by his father
This severe social misalignment
Let her
Living in a profound fear and loneliness
Not surprising
She later developed severe depression.
She began to painfully question her father's choice.
But whenever she showed even the slightest doubt...
The father would then ask in return: Do you want to go back to public school?
Should I join them in the same competitive and arduous struggle?
I'm so good to you
After going through so much trouble
It spared you from the poison of Chinese education.
Why can't you understand my good intentions?
The father kept trying to make his daughter believe
She lived in the happiest of times
The brightest and freest family
Although I am in China
But it is far removed from all Chinese systems.
Negative factors in education
She was completely protected by her father.
Therefore, if she still feels pain
That's definitely not a problem with the father.
Rather, they are "unaware of their own good fortune."
but
This female friend is very smart and brave.
Despite being in such a serious predicament
She eventually broke through her father's iron curtain.
Just like the protagonist in the movie "The Truman Show".
Realizing the falsity of all this
However, not all children can do this.
There are many parents like this in China
They may not be that cultured
But that kind of imprisonment in the name of resisting the mainstream
But equally suffocating
For example, I once saw a report like this
Li Tiejun, a father from Luzhou, Sichuan
Using the excuse that you can't learn anything at school
He forcibly took his daughter, Li Jingci, home and raised her himself.
Li Tiejun stated
When my daughter turned 18
He wants to raise his daughter
Become a scientist in the field of biomagnetism
He also stated
I'd rather go to jail
They also don't send their daughters to school.
This statement has a certain spirit of sacrifice.
Li Tiejun educates his daughter at home in this way.
For 11 years
When the reporter arrived at his home, he found
The 20-year-old daughter sat in the dimly lit room.
Draw for an hour
They couldn't even capture the basic outline of the figure.
She doesn't even understand junior high school level knowledge.
She has no household registration.
No ID card
I can't even buy a train ticket
They became invisible in this society.
The reporter watched Li Jingci paint for an hour.
The outline was not drawn.
When asked if she was tired
Li Jingci replied: This is what I love to do.
I don't feel tired!
This answer
It easily reminds us of
Common on the streets of North Korea
That kind of conditioned reflex response
In such a totalitarian atmosphere
The father is the absolute authority.
The only truth
Li Jingci probably had no idea.
What is true passion?
All she knew was that this was what her father wanted her to do.
Therefore she must love
She has to say "I'm not tired" when she can't draw anymore.
Seeing the reporter's appreciation of Li Jingci's artistic talent
When confused
Li Tiejun was getting anxious.
He asked the reporter: Who are the four ugliest women in Chinese history?
The reporter said they didn't know.
Li Tiejun immediately asked his daughter to answer.
This is actually a common pattern among them.
Li Tiejun really likes to use some very uncommon methods.
And meaningless knowledge
To flaunt and show off her daughter's extensive knowledge
And find pleasure in stumping others
Faced with questions from neighbors and friends
Li Tiejun always looked down on it.
He believes that schools teach people to flatter others.
I can't learn anything
then
He drew up a detailed schedule for his daughter.
It lists the things my daughter does every day.
Drawing, music, reading, memorizing, calligraphy
There are still a lot
sports
Li Tiejun stated
Music, Fine Arts, Astronomy, Medicine
I teach everything
Li Jingci admitted that she couldn't do middle school level test papers.
When the reporter asked
Does this mean
My daughter doesn't have a junior high school education level?
Li Tiejun suddenly became excited.
explain
Even college students can't match my daughter.
Historically
No scientist's contribution will surpass that of Li Jingci.
This kind of agitation is actually a typical case of narcissistic rage.
The father of the girl mentioned at the beginning of our video
So it is.
When he discovered that his daughter was under his tutelage
When becoming increasingly depressed
He wasn't trying to empathize with his daughter.
Instead, she blamed and berated her daughter.
These fathers also knew on a subconscious level.
Children are not happy under their rule.
You could even say they cheated us.
But they absolutely cannot admit this.
then
They had to build an airtight bubble.
In this bubble
secular standards
For example, education level, grades, work
They are all vulgar, dirty, and ineffective.
They stand on a rather idealistic position.
and highly pure position
To criticize all of this
And invented a completely new evaluation system
In this system
They are educators
He is a mentor, a prophet, and a genius.
They just said something.
Children will regard it as truth
This greatly satisfied their vicious narcissism.
They so vehemently criticize the despotism of others.
In reality, it was to establish his own autocracy.
However
A tyranny of many is always better than a tyranny of one.
Our Channel
They also frequently criticize China's education system.
However, a complex and systemic authoritarian system
It is also stronger than one person's tyranny over another.
No matter how authoritarian or exam-oriented a school is
It remains a microcosm of society.
It has a complex ecosystem
In this system
Although there is an annoying homeroom teacher
But there might be one or two with gentle personalities.
Even young teachers who encourage you to rebel
Despite the heavy workload
But there might also be people who share your ideals.
Let's complain about school together
Classmates who secretly look at each other's phones
These different people
Although not the mainstream within the system
They also live in the cracks of the system.
But it is precisely these gaps
These subcultures in the shadows
Give the child breathing space
This gives children the opportunity to compare and distinguish.
Children will discover
It turns out that not all adults think the same way.
The world is diverse.
Even if this diversity is very slight...
For a child's mental maturity
It is also absolutely necessary
However
In this extreme and Chinese-style homeschooling
There is absolutely no such gap.
In this utopia where only parents hold power
The child is facing an omnipotent God.
Father's joys and sorrows
It is the barometer of this world.
Father's values
It is the only truth of this universe.
The child has no classmates to complain to.
There are no other teachers I can ask for help.
There wasn't even a single school bell ringing.
It can declare that she can temporarily escape this environment.
Such families
Similar to what sociologist Goffman said
total institution
Individuals in such organizations
There is no personal privacy.
Her sleep, entertainment, and work
They are all in the same place
Under the same authority
Goffman pointed out
Such an organization must have a privilege system.
They took away what are originally fundamental human rights.
Then turn these into a privilege.
To reward those who obey
Over time
Individuals began to realize that the outside world was indeed terrifying.
They even felt that the inside was better than the outside.
Completely internalized this system
These parents' logic
The original intention was to criticize schools as a total institution.
Trying to build a utopia in home
However, what was achieved
But it is far more stressful and suffocating than school.
It is worth mentioning
We found
These fathers seem to have one huge commonality.
Their own socialization process was a failure.
They either have difficulty gaining recognition in society.
Either they gained recognition
But later suffered some major setback.
Even if you are in an organization
But deep down, he felt extremely lonely and in pain.
In other words
They are, to some extent, a marginalized group.
And the self-identity of young and dependent children
It can greatly nourish them who are on the verge of collapse.
Fragile self
So they chose to retreat back to their families.
In this smallest unit
A was established
An independent kingdom completely under its own control
Li Tiejun is clearly very lonely.
He has few friends.
Living on a meager pension
Spending all day with her daughter
therefore
He certainly didn't want his daughter to have her own ID card.
I don't want my daughter to leave me.
And what we mentioned at the beginning
That female friend's father
Although he achieved considerable worldly success in his early years
However, after experiencing setbacks in the workplace
He has been unable to go out to work for more than ten years.
He was always immersed in
My ideal is to educate my daughter well.
He said
I wanted to focus on my daughter's education.
So many sacrifices were made
He even forbade his daughter from having any contact with her mother.
The reason is that the mother is not educated enough.
It will disrupt my daughter's study plan.
These parents outside
It might just be one
A strange old man with a meager pension
or
A disillusioned middle-aged man who has been unable to work for more than a decade
But at home
Facing young children who are completely dependent on them
They instantly became the embodiment of truth.
This explains
Why this uniquely Chinese form of homeschooling?
It is often accompanied by extreme isolation and exclusivity.
Because once children come into contact with the real world...
Having one's own judgment
The illusion of the father as an omnipotent god will shatter instantly.
Therefore, in order to maintain this illusion
They had to build the wall higher and higher.
certainly
If we try to understand from the child's perspective
We can actually imagine it.
At least in the early stages
The image of a father in the eyes of a child
It must be very charming
They seemed so talented yet unappreciated.
So wise
It is full of criticism of this vulgar and boring world.
They were like a lone hero.
Escaping the banality of evil with the children
In human history
We often see
Many radical ideals originated from resisting the mainstream.
In the early stages
It often carries a fatal moral appeal.
and temptation
However, this is built on the edge
Ideals beyond rebellion and hatred
Although it initially appeared very noble and pure
However, in practice, strange changes often occur.
Why?
Because when they incorporate all mainstream evaluation systems
Whether it's exam scores or degree verification
Or the approval of one's peers
When all are denied and excluded
They thought they had been liberated.
But this actually leads to an extreme feeling of weightlessness.
Because people need references to determine their own coordinates.
When you can't let go of hatred
Therefore, all external feedback had to be cut off.
Although you are exempt from being evaluated
But it also lost the ability to be tested in reality.
This absolute freedom
It brings absolute loneliness and anxiety.
And in order to alleviate this weightlessness and emptiness
The resulting panic
These parents had no choice but to resort to their last resort.
A defense mechanism
They put a lot
Originally a technical and secular issue
It was forcibly transformed into a matter of "good and evil".
The theological problem of "cleanliness and dirtiness"
For example, the child wants to make friends.
In their view
This is not a typical social need.
Instead, it is defined as "whether or not one degenerates into the vulgar masses".
The child is depressed
This shows
The children are still being influenced by this corrupt system and society.
Polluted
And in order to prove that the child is excellent
In other words, their educational experiment was successful.
They must constantly emphasize
That useless knowledge
That is what truly represents wisdom.
This, in turn, led to a major regression in rationality.
and premodern witchcraft
We know
Bourdieu uses French society as an example
A fierce critique of the modern education system
He believes
School education is like a sorcerer performing magic.
Through a series of exams and rankings
To cultivate students' inner mental abilities
To make a seemingly fair and objective selection
Bourdieu sees this as a form of symbolic violence.
It is to forcibly combine academic performance, customs, and school discipline.
Connected to a person's inner essence
However
These parents also criticized the symbolic violence of the school.
But the symbols they rely on and trust
But it is more primitive and rough.
This is precisely the opposite of the spirit of the modern Enlightenment.
We say that one of the basic meanings of enlightenment
It means that people started to use rationality
A technical, analytical perspective
To replace the mystical, moral, and religious perspective
But these parents
This dragged education back to the pre-modern era of witchcraft.
In that enclosed room
Father is no longer an educator
Instead, they degenerated into a tribal shaman.
or High Priest
They believed they were rebelling against the oppression of the system.
In reality, it was about establishing a theocratic regime.
True freedom
Never produced
Amidst hatred and isolation from the world
That might seem very aloof and pure.
But it is also very fragile.
I think true freedom
It lies in our courage to step into that imperfection.
Even some dirty real world
In clashes, compromises, and collaborations with others
Maintain independent thinking
