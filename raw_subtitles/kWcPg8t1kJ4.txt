Today I'm chatting with Lewis Bollard, 
who is Farm Animal Welfare program  
director at Open Philanthropy.
Open Philanthropy is the  
biggest charity in this animal welfare space.
Lewis, thanks so much for coming on the podcast. 
Thanks for having me on.
First question. At some point we'll have AGI. 
How do you think about the 
problem you're trying to solve? 
Are you trying to make conditions more 
tolerable for the next 10 years until AI  
solves this problem for us?
Or is there some reason to  
think that the interventions we're 
making in terms of improvements,  
like in-ovo sexing or cage-free eggs, etc., will 
have an impact beyond this transformative moment? 
The end of factory farming is far from inevitable.
Every year we're factory farming about 2% more  
animals globally.
There are two  
possible trajectories we could go down.
One is the trajectory that we have been on  
for the last century, which is that technology 
has made factory farming ever more efficient,  
resulted in ever more animals being 
abused and ever more intensive ways. 
There is a trajectory where we reduce the number 
of animals on factory farms, where we reduce the  
suffering of each of those animals.
So, even if we get AGI, I am really  
optimistic that that will accelerate 
forms of technological progress. 
It will bring us better alternative proteins 
and it will improve humane technology. 
But there are still huge cultural and 
political obstacles to alternatives. 
The cultural obstacles are that 
most people want real meat. 
Most people have the option already of plant-based 
meat that tastes about as good as real meat. 
Does it? I don't know.
This is a debate. That's  
fair. This is a debate. But I don't think 
that's just the obstacle that people have. 
There are a lot of people who say, "I'm just not 
interested in the alternative. I want the real  
thing." Then there's also the political obstacle.
Let's say that AGI solves cultivated meat for us. 
Cultivated meat is already 
illegal in seven US states. 
It might soon be illegal in 
the entire European Union. 
By the time we get AGI, will they 
even be able to sell it anywhere? 
Again, there's a huge amount of good 
that technology can do in this space. 
I'm optimistic that AGI 
can accelerate that hugely. 
But at the same time, we should prepare 
for the significant possibility that AGI  
does not end factory farming.
This is an incredibly efficient  
system that has persisted through all kinds 
of technological changes, and could persist  
through this technological change.
What is it that makes it so efficient? 
The basic efficiency is that the 
animal, and the chicken in particular,  
has evolved over a very long time to be a 
being that can take in a relatively small  
amount of grain and convert it very efficiently 
into a form of protein that people like to eat. 
The feed conversion ratio for chickens, the 
amount of grain you put in to get meat out,  
is 2x. That grain is incredibly cheap. The 
rest of the production process is incredibly  
cheap because they've removed everything 
that costs money, treating animals well and  
providing comfort and all that stuff.
They've just gotten rid of it all. 
They've gotten down to the 
point where it's insanely cheap. 
You're trying to beat the price of 
grain times two, plus a few extra costs. 
That is actually a really hard target to meet.
That's why factory farmed chicken  
is so insanely cheap today.
Maybe an intuition pump here. We've been spending  
on the order of hundreds of billions of dollars 
a year in order to replicate human intelligence. 
And human intelligence has been developed—it 
depends on when you start counting intelligence  
as having started evolving—but on the 
order of hundreds to tens of millions of  
years ago, evolution has been trying to 
optimize for this intelligence thing. 
And we've had to spend all this 
effort in order to replicate it. 
Converting calories into meat has 
been something that evolution has  
been optimizing for billions of years.
Everything from the immune system to  
growth factors to delivering nutrition, 
etc, texture or whatever… This is what  
evolution is working on the entire time.
So it makes sense why this is actually  
such a tough problem.
Are you ready to  
throw some cold water on your friends?
How far away is cultivated meat actually? 
It completely depends on what we do from here.
It also depends on what you  
mean by cultivated meat.
There are companies right now that  
are selling cultivated meat, in very small volumes 
at very high price points, which is incredible. 
The challenge from here is how do you 
scale that and bring the price point  
down to compete with the incredibly low 
price point of factory farmed chicken. 
How long it takes to get there, 
and indeed whether we get there,  
really depends on what happens from here.
We are not on a path right now when it comes to  
the amount of venture capital funding available, 
when it comes to the current startups available…  
We're not on a path to reach cultivated meat 
that is cheaper than factory farmed chicken. 
We could get on that path…
Ever? 
Depends. It’s contingent on AGI and 
contingent on what happens with AGI. 
I wouldn't rule it out, but I 
don't think it's the default path. 
I don't think it's the most likely outcome.
Eventually, we'll have nanotech or whatever. 
At that point, raising chickens 
can't be the thing to do. 
You would think nanotech and bringing robotics 
in and all these things… But unless the cost  
of all those things goes down to close to zero, 
chickens are just going to be so insanely cheap.  
Maybe. It is totally possible that these AGI 
technologies introduce incredible new proteins  
that help solve this problem for us.
But I don't think we should rely on it. 
First, because they might not be able 
to solve some of these problems to the  
point that it is as cheap as chicken.
But second, because you still have these  
cultural and political barriers.
The reason I think this is a very  
interesting example is because whenever 
people think about the use of technology  
to improve animal welfare, they're thinking 
about cultivated meat, lab meat, etc. 
They're thinking about these 
extremely far-off solutions. 
Then it makes sense why people who are especially 
concerned about this space, the first thought is  
not to just find ways to make the existing 
regime more tolerable, but to come up with  
some moonshot that changes the whole paradigm.
If you look at how much VC investment is going  
towards cultivated meat.
Do you have some sense of  
how much goes into it a year?
Versus how much VC investment  
goes into, "Okay, we've already got the farms.
What is it that we need to do to come up with more  
things like putting the eggs through MRIs?
Let's do these other small  
improvements in welfare"?
There's a huge difference.  
The venture capital on humane technology 
is probably less than $10 million a year. 
$10 million?
That would be my guess, whereas  
the venture capital on the alternative proteins 
has been in the billions over the last few years. 
Which has probably been motivated, 
at least partly, by the sense of,  
"We're going to make things more ethical."
People might not realize that in the near term,  
to actually make things more ethical, it might 
be just better to increase that $10 million pool. 
It's good to do both. Both of these are important. 
I can see why alternative proteins have a  
more promising allure to investors.
First, it could be higher margins. 
But second, it feels more like 
the electric vehicle or the solar  
that just totally replaces the old practice.
It's something totally new that replaces it. 
It has that potential for 
some portion of the market. 
But what I don't see happening anytime 
soon is the entire market switching  
over to these alternative proteins.
We need alternative proteins to meet  
the world's growing demand for protein so that 
we don't just have ever more factory farming. 
And we need humane technology 
to reduce the suffering within  
the factory farming that does exist.
Whenever a discussion like this comes up, it's  
often phrased in the context of personal behavior.
I think people will be assuming that what we're  
going to get up to is this 
push to make you vegetarian. 
I happen to have been vegetarian.
I grew up a Hindu, so I've never eaten meat. 
Then I just stayed a vegetarian 
after I was no longer a Hindu. 
But then I started prepping 
to interview you and I'm like… 
I don't know how valuable this is, especially 
if you look at some of these online charity  
evaluators and you're just like, "A dollar of 
your donation will offset this much meat-eating." 
You're like, "What are we doing here?" 
But anyways, vegetarianism, overrated? 
I think we made a mistake as a movement 
making this about personal diet. 
It's great when folks want to make a personal 
diet decision, whether that is eating less  
meat or meat from more humane sources, but 
the focus should not be on the individual. 
This is not how large-scale social change occurs. 
We need government reform. We need corporate  
reform. People can be a part of that regardless of 
what they eat, regardless of what their diet is. 
We need people to be advocates and 
funders and supporters of this cause. 
How did we end up in this position?
When people think about animal welfare, they think  
PETA, they think of protesters who are encouraging 
individuals to give up meat consumption? 
At the same time, these charities, 
which are so effective at corporate  
or policy changes, are just so neglected.
How did this end up being the landscape  
of animal welfare activism and funding?
It's a puzzle. It seems so obvious that you  
can have far larger-scale change at the level 
of governmental change and corporate change. 
Instead, we get fixated about whether 
someone is completely vegan or vegetarian. 
I think what happened is that when people 
started learning about this issue initially,  
it was just a few people and they felt totally 
powerless to achieve larger-scale change. They  
understandably focused on themselves. Then it 
started to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
It started to become an end in itself, where 
it was about personal purity as much as about  
the impact you're having on the issue.
It's much easier to measure your own  
personal purity than it is to measure your 
total impact on reforming factory farming. 
It just became this kind of inward focus.
The good news is, that has changed  
tremendously in the last decade.
The movement has gone from being  
one that was obsessed with personal 
purity, obsessed with dietary choices,  
to one that is much more obsessed with impact.
This is why I really wanted to do this episode. 
I think people will be aware that there's a 
general problem here, but the actual politics,  
the actual economics, the actual state of 
the technology landscape here… there might be  
interventions which are stupendously effective, 
which we overlook just because people are not  
aware of what's actually happening in this space.
On that point, to use an analogy from global  
health and poverty.
The Against Malaria  
Foundation estimates that it saved on the 
order of 180,000 lives, which is a lot. 
But then you compare it to China liberalizing, 
which brought a billion people out of poverty. 
That's just a many, many orders 
of magnitude bigger impact. 
In animal welfare, do you have some big 
take about what the "China-liberalizing"  
equivalent in this space is?
There have been three  
large-scale drivers of progress so far.
The first has been government policy. 
Advocates got the European Union to 
set basic animal welfare standards. 
That is billions of animals every year, billions 
every year. Then there’s corporate reforms. We  
see the same thing. There's this incredible 
scale across these corporate supply chains. 
McDonald's just implemented its 
pledge to go cage-free in the US. 
That alone is seven million hens every year out 
of cages, just in the McDonald's supply chain.  
The third lever is technology. One example would 
be in-ovo sexing as a new technology that can get  
rid of the need to kill male chicks.
In the egg industry,  
the unwanted chicks are killed at birth.
In-ovo sexing has already spared about  
200 million chicks from that fate.
So there are these giant drivers. 
The good news is we're just 
getting started with them. 
There is the potential, I think, to help tens 
of billions of animals through these drivers. 
I want to go into in-ovo sexing.
Just the fact that you can have  
a new technology and you can have basically 
Pareto improvements where things aren't getting  
more expensive… Maybe in the future they'll 
actually get cheaper because of this technology. 
At the same time, you're having 
improvements in animal welfare. 
The problem, of course, with this industry has 
been that in the past, increases in efficiency  
have been coupled with increases in cruelty.
I want to understand whenever the trend  
goes in the opposite direction, 
what causes that to be the case? 
What is the history of this technology? How 
does it work? Why did it take so long for it to  
come into common practice?
The historical basis is a  
story of technology doing harm.
Initially, the egg industry and the  
meat chicken industry separated because they 
realized they could grow meat chickens to be  
optimized for weight gain and laying 
hens to be optimized for laying eggs. 
That meant that the laying-egg 
industry had no need for male chicks. 
They couldn't lay eggs and they couldn't 
grow fast enough to be meat chickens. 
What they decided was to just kill 
them on the day they were born. 
The standard practice is that about 8 billion 
chicks globally every year are just thrown in  
a giant meat grinder or suffocated in bags the 
day they're born. Crazy. This new technology is  
basically the application of existing technologies 
to scan the eggs in advance and work out whether  
they're going to be male or female.
And then you can just get rid of the male  
eggs very early in the incubation phase.
This technology went from, 10 years ago,  
just being a vague idea to today where it's 
already a third of the European egg industry. 
It just got introduced to the United States.
We've got the first eggs coming  
out in the United States now.
This is a technology that is growing rapidly. 
I'm really optimistic it can 
ultimately end this problem globally. 
How much was this driven by policy versus the 
tech being mature enough for it to be economical? 
It was both. First, there 
was some policy up front. 
Because advocates had drawn attention 
to this practice of killing male chicks. 
There was real impetus by 
governments and philanthropists  
to support kickstarting this technology.
My estimate is it was about $10 million, a very  
little amount of public and philanthropic 
money that kickstarted this technology,  
got it to a point where startups could 
start to implement the technology. 
I'd be curious to understand exactly.
MRIs have existed for a while,  
PCRs have existed for a while.
Why did it take this long  
for this to be economical?
What was the nature of that cost curve? 
I'm especially interested to understand this 
because it seems to imply… We didn't have  
to come up with some brand-new 
tech in order to enable this. 
Are there other things where somebody 
who is somewhat familiar with the  
technological landscape… People are 
always looking for startup ideas. 
Should they just spend a couple days at a big 
poultry farm or pig farm or something and see  
if things can't be improved?
I think there's huge  
potential for technologists here.
There is a lot of low-hanging fruit. 
This is primarily a commodity business 
that has only done things that reduce  
the price or increase production levels.
It has not invested in animal welfare. 
And as a result, you find these things 
it's doing that just seem archaic. 
Like the way that it is castrating piglets is 
with a blunt knife and with no pain relief. 
In that case, there was a new technology of 
immunocastration, an injection that achieved the  
same effects, and it was very easy to develop.
I think there are a whole lot of  
other practices like that out there.
There's a whole lot of these archaic practices  
being done where someone could come in, and with 
a little bit of smart work around this and an  
actual focus on animal welfare, bring in solutions 
that could potentially help billions of animals. 
One important dynamic to this industry that you've 
pointed out is that whenever we have to ruthlessly  
optimize for efficiency in one domain, it causes 
all kinds of other problems that we have to then  
make up for with even more cruelty.
Think of what we've done to pigs. 
We took pigs inside from outdoors and we 
selected them to grow faster and to have  
this inadvertent greater aggression, the 
first thing they started doing was getting  
bored and biting each other's tails.
That was a problem, so then we said,  
"We'll cut the tails off." Well, that didn't 
work. So then we had to start clipping the  
teeth and cutting part of their teeth off.
That still wasn't enough when it came to the sows. 
So then we had to put them 
in crates to protect them  
from any other animal, and that wasn't enough.
So then we gave them antibiotics and other drugs. 
At each step, there is a new solution that can't 
solve the fundamental underlying parts of the  
problem, and sometimes just makes it worse.
Could we make chickens or pigs with no brains? 
Because it’s the suffering we care about.
To the extent that their bodies are just these  
incredibly well-evolved bioreactors for converting 
grain into meat whereas optimization has led to  
more and more cruelty in the past, in this 
case, this is the ultimate optimization. 
They're not moving around at all.
They are literally just a machine  
for producing more meat.
The suffering is in some  
sense inefficient, if they're pecking at other 
animals, if they're catching on wires, etc. 
This is something that it would be 
better, even economically, to eliminate. 
You're right. The suffering is uneconomical 
at the level of an individual animal. 
The animals that we have selected for and 
the way we have treated them result in more  
of those animals dying, more of them 
having all kinds of welfare problems. 
The problem is that it is 
collectively more efficient. 
If you can cram twice as many animals into a 
barn, it doesn't matter if 10% more of them die. 
That's been the underlying model of this industry.
The reason welfare gets neglected is that it has a  
slight cost, but the efficiency 
gains are so much greater. 
I agree we should try and 
find things to reverse that. 
I am personally more optimistic about 
these kinds of incremental reforms. 
The average person listening to 
this is not thinking, "Oh yeah,  
I'm really pumped for the brainless chickens 
to come along and just persuade me." 
But they're not pumped about the 
cultivated meat either, right? 
No, sure. This is why you need a 
whole bunch of different approaches. 
There's no one solution that 
is going to satisfy everyone. 
What I would say on genetics is that 
what feels way more achievable to me in  
the near term is to get rid of the genetic 
physical problems that ail these animals. 
For instance, we've bred these chickens to be 
mutants that collapse under their own weight. 
We know that we can breed for far higher welfare 
birds that are still commercially viable. 
Indeed, there are companies, and there are places 
like Denmark, where the industry has already moved  
entirely toward these higher welfare birds.
They have way better welfare outcomes  
that suffer way less.
What's different about them? 
The first thing about them is that 
they are more balanced overall. 
Where the industry has just selected 
for rapid breast meat growth and for  
really efficient feed conversion, these 
birds have been bred to have robustness. 
They have broader legs so 
their legs don't collapse. 
They have better cardio systems, so they 
don't develop all these cardio problems. 
In general, they've just been 
bred for welfare outcomes. 
We're just like, "Let's just breed a bunch 
of birds and find the ones that die less." 
Are they less economical?
They're slightly less economical.  
This is why, because they haven't been 
ruthlessly selected for those two variables  
of breast meat yield and feed conversion.
They cost a little bit more, and this is why  
you need advocacy to get people to adopt them.
There has been huge advocacy in France,  
in Germany, in Denmark to get this.
In fact just last month,  
the largest French chicken producer, the LDC 
Group, committed to moving its two main brands  
to these higher welfare genetics
Why not think that they will just  
be eaten up in terms of their welfare impact?
To the extent that the economics in the industry  
for a century have been to cram more things in, 
to figure out how to optimize along axes which  
just make the animal incredibly unhealthy and 
immiserated for longer and in more extreme ways? 
Okay, we'll come up with in-ovo sexing, 
but then there will be another thing  
which is the equivalent of gestation crates.
Why think that even technologically the thing that  
is favored is the suffering-free optimizations?
I think you’re right. This is the story of a lot  
of the industry's efforts to improve welfare.
There was a study back in the 90s where  
they taught chickens how to 
select pain relief-laced feed. 
They found the broiler chickens were all 
selecting the pain relief-laced feed,  
suggesting they were all in chronic pain.
The industry said, "Don't worry, we'll address  
it. We'll strengthen their legs." So they went 
away and they strengthened their legs for a bit. 
Then they were like, "Wow, it's great.
The chickens have stronger legs now. 
They can go and eat more stuff and we 
can put more weight on those legs." 
So then they made them bigger and 
essentially undid those gains. 
In recent years we've seen the mortality rate 
in the industry rising again and getting worse. 
So presumably they've just pushed 
so far again in that direction. So  
that's a major risk. This is why you need 
the government or corporations involved. 
This is why you need the government 
setting out a baseline standard saying,  
"You can't go below this welfare floor."
For instance in Denmark, the government  
is strongly encouraging the move toward these 
higher welfare breeds and looking to ban low  
welfare outcome breeds entirely.
You need to maintain those  
higher welfare outcomes.
This is what you need in  
corporate supply chains too.
This is also what you see with  
the French retailers moving away 
from these low welfare breeds. 
You need them to maintain those standards.
Because you're right, the industry left on  
its own will always find a race to the bottom.
Potentially, we could find ways to make animals  
even bigger with the future forms of biological 
progress that some of my guests talk about. 
It's already the case that it's better 
to eat beef than chicken, because cows  
just have so much more meat per brain.
What if we just got rid of the myostatin  
inhibitor genes or whatever, and then 
now there's even more meat per cow? 
Is that better because you have more meat per 
cow, or is it worse because it's potentially going  
to lead to the same dynamic of these overgrown, 
more suffering animals? Which way does that tilt? 
I think it probably tilts toward more suffering.
This is what you see with the history of  
breeding these chickens to be the 
kind of mutants they are today. 
They've achieved a 4x gain in 
growth rates since the 1950s. 
That has led to a 2x drop in price, and that 
has led to a 3x increase in consumption. 
Because consumption has gone up so dramatically, 
and the suffering per bird has gone up so  
dramatically, that has outweighed the 
benefits of these birds being bigger. 
But the consumption might have gone up regardless.
So actually then it's not clear. 
To the extent that we hold consumption constant, 
and maybe we shouldn't, they would have to be  
suffering 4x as much as a chicken in the 
1950s for it not to be a net improvement. 
I don't know if you disagree with that.
There is an in-between ground solution now. 
The higher welfare breeds that we 
are advocating for producers to  
adopt are not 1950s growth levels.
They grow almost at 2025 growth  
levels scaled back slightly in a way that 
enables much larger welfare improvements. 
You don't have to go backwards to the level 
of these incredibly slow-growing animals. Some  
people will want that. There'll be a market for 
like heritage chickens and people who are willing  
to pay for these extremely slow-growing animals.
But the more realistic thing at scale is going  
to be these ones that still 
grow fast and still get big,  
but do so in a way that doesn't totally destroy 
their bodies and cause them to suffer so much. 
It's just striking me now that the 
way to think about what we're doing  
to these animals is not even… This would 
already be just incredibly immoral, finding  
creatures in the wild and then caging them up 
and then putting them through awful tortures. 
Rather, we are manufacturing creatures 
basically optimized for suffering. 
It's not even like, "We found this chicken and 
now we're going to put this in this little cage." 
It's like, "We have designed this chicken 
to basically suffer as much as possible. 
We have literally genetically changed it as much 
as we can plausibly change it given the technology  
available to us today, in this Frankensteinian 
way, to suffer as much as possible." 
That framing just makes it especially gruesome.
I agree. This is the story of  
the chicken meat industry.
They have just bred and bred  
so that these animals suffer more and more.
I'll give you another example of that,  
which is the breeding birds.
The birds that they have that are  
raised for meat are optimized to only survive 
until about seven or eight weeks of age. 
Even by that age, a lot of them are 
keeling over, getting lame, collapsing. 
But they're not at puberty yet.
So they need to raise some of these birds past  
puberty to raise the next generation of birds.
For those birds to not totally collapse under  
their genetics, they have to starve them.
What they do is they give the breeding  
birds about 30% of the feed that 
the birds would eat on their own. 
They're starving them 70%, because 
that is the only way to stop these  
birds from completely collapsing under the 
genetics that they've inflicted on them. 
In just reading about the accounts of, 
for example pigs in gestation crates,  
and the medical symptoms like swollen ankles, 
broken bones obviously from chewing the iron bars,  
all the bruises that cause ulcers, tumors, 
cancers, pus, etc… These are not rare medical  
emergencies, but the regular anticipated, 
expected outcomes across populations of pigs. 
Individual farms will house thousands of them 
and, of course, around the world a billion. 
I'm sure you've visited many 
of these places yourself  
or have had friends who've done so, right?
I've visited factory farms. It is every bit as  
bad as it looks on the videos you can find online.
It is every bit… The addition you see is,  
first, you hear the noise, the 
distress yelps from these animals. 
You smell it, it smells awful.
But the other thing I noticed,  
I visited one egg factory farm.
It's impossible for farmers to provide  
individual care to each of these birds.
This was a relatively well-run farm. 
Yet I still found a whole lot 
of hens stuck in the wire. 
Those hens are just going to slowly starve. 
Indeed many had. There were a lot of dead birds  
in with the live birds in other cages.
That's just because of the scale. 
One farmer is trying to look after 200,000 hens.
The only thing they can actually do is check the  
feed lines and check the water lines 
and remove some of the dead birds. 
In fact, that is the work of a factory 
farmer, largely removing dead animals. 
It is just this dystopian thing where the 
industry presents this picture of, "Oh,  
we have individual care for our animals."
The scale at which you were doing it  
has totally prohibited having any 
kind of individual care like that. 
This is an issue where scope sensitivity 
is just so insane, the magnitude. 
If this one battery cage farm was the only 
thing that existed in the world—if there  
was this one farm in India that had 100,000 
chickens which were each just experiencing  
weeks upon weeks of pain through their 
life—that would already be a moral emergency. 
But it's so easy to forget that if 
there's 10 billion chickens that  
are alive at any point in the world.
The whole problem is five orders of  
magnitude bigger than this one farm itself.
So 100,000 times bigger than this one farm. 
It's just stupendous to comprehend 
the scale of the problem. 
It's crazy. You see this total confusion in 
the laws we pass, for instance, dog fighting. 
It’s a real evil, it's horrific, but we're talking 
about thousands of animals. Congress has passed  
multiple laws. Every state has made it a felony.
It is being regulated, correctly,  
out of existence.
Meanwhile, the factory  
farming of pigs occurs on this far greater scale.
We've even done the same thing with cockfighting,  
which is literally chickens.
Again, it's literally thousands  
of chickens. We have rightly banned it. 
We've rightly made it felony animal cruelty. 
Yet when factory farmers do far worse to a far 
larger number of chickens, we call that commerce. 
Okay, so the positive spin on that can be 
that, because of how big the problem is and how  
neglected it is, the ability of any one person 
to have a big impact might genuinely shock  
them. Let's get into that. You are the biggest 
funder in this space, but cumulatively between  
you and the others, what is the amount of smart 
money that is being allocated to this problem? 
We think less than $300 million is being devoted 
to all work globally around every possible  
solution to factory farming across every country.
Less than 200 million of that is what  
you would consider smart money going to 
evidence-based, effective interventions. 
To put that into perspective, 
philanthropic climate advocacy  
alone is 50 times bigger than that.
The work of cat and dog shelters and rescue  
groups in the US alone, 25 times bigger than that.
There are individual conservation and poverty  
charities that are 5 to 10x bigger than that.
So this is a tiny amount of money  
for the purpose of social reform.
Yet it has achieved a huge amount, impacting  
hundreds of millions, billions of animals.
What would happen if the amount of funding in  
this space doubled from the $200-300 million 
you mentioned that is being spent smartly? 
I know you will say there's a bunch of things we 
could optimize around. There's so many neglected  
issues. But is there an immediate thing which 
is the thing that is directly at the margin,  
the next $100 million or the next 
$10 million would enable this? 
Additional funding would be 
transformative. We have a playbook  
that works on a number of these issues.
One of the first things would be  
holding companies to account for animal 
welfare policies they've already made. 
We've got huge numbers of companies that made 
commitments to getting rid of battery cages and  
are now trying to back out of them or ignore them.
With additional campaign funding, we could hold  
them to those, and as a result immediately 
improve the conditions of millions of animals. 
For years, the industry used these battery 
cages that are these microwave-oven-sized cages. 
They cram as many hens in as they can 
and they leave them there for years. 
We know consumers don't think 
this is acceptable, but the  
industry doesn't disclose their use of them.
It's not like when you pick up a pack of eggs,  
it has a big thing saying "from caged 
hens" or an image of where they came from. 
Advocates went to the largest retailers, 
the largest fast-food chains, and said,  
"You need to move away from this because 
your consumers already expect this of you. 
This is what your consumers clearly want and 
they clearly don't accept this practice." 
They got pledges from almost all of the largest 
food companies, not just in the US but globally,  
to move away from these practices.
We're already seeing that this transition  
has already spared over 200 million 
hens a year from these battery cages. 
The US has gone from less than 
10% cage-free to 47% cage-free. 
The European Union is now 62% 
cage-free. This is a huge transition. 
How did they do this?
They captured this basic divide  
between what consumers expected was already 
happening and what was actually happening. 
I loved this specific example 
where there's a super tractable  
thing that is immediately available with 
the next millions of dollars in funding. 
Is there a particular charity which 
works on these campaigns in particular? 
I think that one great way to support them is 
to support a diversified portfolio of groups. 
There's a group, FarmKind, that allows 
people to donate to a variety of groups. 
Two of those groups that you can donate to through 
that platform, The Humane League and Sinergia  
Animal, are both working on exactly this.
I think people might just not be  
aware of the ratio of dollars to 
suffering averted in this space. 
Can you give some sense of what we're 
talking about, dollar to suffering, here? 
The work to get hens out of cages has already 
spared over 200 million hens from cages. 
The work to improve the lives of broiler 
chickens has already benefited over a  
billion animals. That's just every year.
Wait, sorry, it's 200 million a year? 
200 million a year.
Sorry, I missed that. I  
thought it was cumulative across.
No, cumulatively we're already  
well north of 500 million hens.
We're into the billions of broiler chickens. 
If you assume these things weren't just around the 
corner, they weren't just going to happen anyway,  
if you think you probably sped up progress 
by years, decades, maybe it would never  
have happened… That cumulative impact 
over those years and decades is giant. 
We're talking billions, we're 
talking tens of billions. 
The amount of money spent just on those 
corporate reforms was less than $100  
million a year over a couple of years.
We're talking about a ratio that is  
far less than 1:10 of a dollar per 
year of animal well being improved. 
So you're saying $1 can do more than 10 years of 
a better, more humane life? That is stupendous. A  
couple hours of pain is just awful and terrible.
You're saying 10 years for a dollar? 
The reason why that’s so 
shocking…On its face it's shocking. 
But in other areas where you're trying 
to do global health or something, first,  
the problem is improving on its own.
Second, with the Gates Foundation etc.,  
there's tens of billions of dollars 
already being poured into the problem. 
It’s the same with climate change, etc.
The idea that you would find an  
intervention where a single dollar can 
go this far is just genuinely crazy. 
It's very unique. The reason this 
philanthropic opportunity exists is because  
this area has been systematically neglected.
Most people, when they think of philanthropy,  
do not think of farmed animals.
Most people pile into popular areas  
like education and healthcare and climate.
As a result, you end up with these outsized  
opportunities that no one has taken advantage of.
If the space had billions of dollars in it,  
as other philanthropic areas do, you 
would not see opportunities like this. 
I won’t bury the lede any longer.
I've always been interested in this issue. 
I lost track of it for a 
little while, to be honest. 
But I encountered you on Twitter and I 
started learning more about the issue. 
We chatted a few times in person, and that 
motivated me to have you on the podcast and  
also to donate myself.
As you mentioned,  
FarmKind Giving is this re-grantor.
They don't keep any of the money themselves. 
They just regrant it to the most 
effective charities in this area. 
They're basically like an index fund across 
the most effective charities in animal welfare. 
It motivated me to donate to them.
So I'm giving $250,000,  
and I'm doing this as a donation match.
This is to say that you the listener,  
if you contribute to this donation match, 
we can double each other's impacts. 
Between the two of us, we can allocate $500,000—if 
we saturate this, and I really want to saturate  
this—to the most effective charities in this area.
Remember how neglected this area is. 
Lewis, as you were just mentioning, $1 that 
is donated in this area corresponds to 10  
years of animal suffering that is averted, 
which is just stupendous to think about. 
There's no other cost area in the 
world which has such a crazy ratio. 
That has to do with how neglected this area is.
The positive connotation of that neglectedness  
is just how big an impact any person listening 
to this podcast can have. That's the donation  
match. The way you can contribute to it 
is to go to farmkind.giving/dwarkesh. 
I also recognize that there's people in the 
audience who can do much more than this amount. 
Given how neglected this issue is… Remember, 
there's on the order of $100 million or $200  
million that is being spent wisely on this topic.
One such person listening could double the amount  
of money that is being spent effectively in 
this area. That's crazy to think about. If  
you are one such person, just think about that.
Even if you can't double the amount of money  
that's being spent in the area, you could cause 
a double-digit increase in the amount of funding  
that these effective causes are receiving.
For those people in the position to contribute  
much more, or at least want to get 
their foot in the door and explore  
contributions of $50k or higher, Lewis, 
what's the best way they can reach you? 
In that case, we'd love to hear from you.
People can message me on X, or they can  
reach out to my colleague Andres.
That is Andres with one ‘a’. So it is  
andres@openphilanthropy.org. He would love to work 
with you, and I'd love to work with you to help  
you spend that money as effectively as possible.
Okay, but if you're like the rest of us and  
you need to start off on a more humble basis, 
again, your donation would already just have a  
huge impact given how neglected the space is. 
Again, the link is farmkind.giving/dwarkesh. 
Let's talk about other countries. You 
are not only the biggest funder in this  
cause area in the United States, but globally.
Obviously, animal suffering in Sri Lanka or China  
is just as bad as animal suffering here.
What is especially promising, especially  
given that more people in these 
countries will start eating meat? 
This problem is getting worse over time.
It's getting worse because people are  
getting wealthier and eating more meat.
What seems like the most useful intervention,  
or the useful thing to understand, 
about what to do about that? 
There are a couple of things.
Countries, where their protein consumption  
is rapidly growing and there is not yet a 
deeply entrenched animal agricultural industry,  
have the ability to do things differently.
In particular, they have the ability  
to support alternative protein work 
without that being politically toxic. 
For example, we see China investing very 
heavily in cultivated meat research. 
The majority of patents coming out globally 
on cultivated meat now are coming out  
from public universities in China.
This is a case where the US is being  
overtaken because we have this entrenched 
industry that is ferociously lobbying. 
I also think there's the potential to 
extend animal welfare policies globally. 
We're seeing multinationals like Unilever and 
Nestlé and even Burger King saying we shouldn't  
have cages in our supply chain globally.
This creates the potential to spread best  
practices, just in the same way that factory 
farming spread from the United States globally. 
But factory farming spread because it was 
cheaper, not because there was some law passed  
that everybody else felt the need to copy.
That's right. We essentially had  
economic efficiency spread factory farming.
In some cases, that can spread higher welfare  
tech, for example, in-ovo sexing technology.
Once that has been derisked enough, once it  
has been scaled up in Europe and the US, I'm 
optimistic it will become cheaper and then it will  
just be scaled out globally for economic reasons.
But also, we can spread moral progress. 
We know that people in these countries also 
care about animal welfare. I had a fascinating  
conversation. I went to a trade show and I talked 
with a company that manufactures gestation crates. 
I was like, what do you think about 
the future sales of these crates? 
They're like, "Well, we already have 
stopped selling them in Europe and the US." 
I was like, "Do you think you'll just be able 
to sell them in Asia forever?" They're like,  
"No way. As Asia gets richer and is on 
social media and sees the images and things,  
they're not going to be cool with this either.
We know there is a limit to how long we're going  
to be able to sell these things for."
I think that gives me some optimism. 
As countries get richer, they generally 
get more concerned about this issue,  
and that then enables them to adopt animal 
welfare reforms as we've seen in the West. 
On net, is there a Kuznets curve here?
Initially they get wealthy enough to afford the  
most economical forms of meat, which are battery 
cages, etc., and then they get even wealthier so  
that they can afford the potentially slightly more 
expensive versions of meat which are more humane. 
Or on net, is it just that you keep eating 
more meat through this whole process? 
Even if it gets slightly more ethical, the 
amount of meat consumption will rise 2x or 3x. 
So wealth always correlates 
with more suffering, basically. 
It's mixed. So far globally, wealth has 
heavily correlated with more suffering. 
The drive of people getting richer has led 
to them eating far more meat and far more of  
that coming from factory farming.
We have overwhelmingly seen that  
trend across all countries.
In a few European countries,  
we are starting to see the dynamic where once 
countries have reached a certain degree of wealth,  
they are able to bring about reforms that 
actually reduce the total amount of suffering. 
I think it is quite likely that Germany has passed 
the top of that curve and is now on the other side  
of diminishing total animal suffering.
The critical thing to bear in mind  
is that this does not happen on its own.
In Germany, this happened because there  
are very talented advocates who harnessed 
that public opinion and concern to drive  
corporate reforms to the retailers and to 
drive government policy reforms. We need to  
do that. I don't think you can just count that 
people are going to get to a certain degree of  
wealth and this is going to happen.
I think it only happens if there is  
advocacy to mobilize that public opinion.
A difficulty that these animal welfare policies  
have had is that even if you outlaw a practice 
domestically, to the extent that it's cheaper to  
produce meat that way, people will just import 
meat produced that way that is made elsewhere. 
States in the US who have tried 
to do this have had this problem. 
Countries in Europe that have tried 
to do this have had this problem. 
How do you solve the lowest common denominator 
problem in animal welfare standards? 
It's a huge problem. Advocates in 
the US passed ballot measures in  
Florida and Arizona to ban gestation crates.
Then the pork industry just imported crated  
pork from other states into those states.
So advocates then went to California and  
Massachusetts and passed ballot measures that 
extended the same standards to the sale of  
pork within the state.
That you can't sell  
pork from crated pigs anywhere.
I think that is a critical move,  
and we're seeing the European Union now 
considering doing the same thing, imposing  
animal welfare standards equally on imports.
That policy is critical to not just ensuring that  
you're not getting these laws undercut, but also 
to changing the political dynamic because domestic  
or local farmers are going to be very opposed to 
any law if they realize they're just going to get  
undercut by out-of-state competition, rightly so.
This is a chance to also change that political  
dynamic so they can actually 
support the law, knowing that  
they are not at a relative disadvantage.
Potentially reversed by an upcoming bill, right? 
This is right. The pork industry, 
unfortunately, has looked at these  
laws in California and Massachusetts and wants 
to do everything it can to undermine them. 
It knows this is the only way 
it can be effectively regulated,  
given that it has an absolute hold on the 
legislatures in Iowa and North Carolina,  
which are the main states for pork production.
It knows that it needs to stop any other  
state from setting production 
standards or sales standards. 
It first went to the Supreme Court.
It first said this is unconstitutional,  
the states can't do this. The Supreme Court 
disagreed. We won at the Supreme Court. 
Now it has gone to Congress, and it's saying to 
Congress, "You need to wipe out these state laws. 
You need to stop them from doing this."
The unfortunate thing is the Senate and  
the House are both on track to do that.
In the upcoming farm bill, there is  
language that would ban states from 
passing laws on the sales standard,  
on animal welfare sales standards on goods.
Right now, the default path is that that will pass  
as part of the farm bill in the next few months.
If advocates are able to pass these laws or  
ballots at the state level, and it's 
popular enough that they're passing,  
why is it that at the national level they can't 
make a ruckus about this and prevent this from  
getting added to the full farm bill?
The first problem is structural. At  
the state level, they've had to use ballot 
measures to get around entrenched lobbies. 
In this case, things start out in the House 
and Senate Agricultural Committees, which are  
heavily dominated by agricultural interests.
The majority of House members signed a letter  
against this in the last Congress, but the vast 
majority of them are not on the Ag Committee. 
The Ag Committee gets to 
decide what's in this bill. 
The House Ag Committee just 
hosted a hearing on this. 
They only invited lobbyists for the industry.
They didn't bother to invite a single  
opposing witness to their hearing.
We're also seeing that the industry  
is much better organized and funded 
on this effort than advocates are. 
The industry is constantly flying out 
a bunch of big industrial pork farmers,  
claiming they speak for the entire industry, 
telling the legislators this is their number  
one priority and absolutely has to be done.
By contrast, animal welfare groups are  
not getting the same hearing.
Legislators are not taking them  
as seriously as they take these Ag lobbies.
Shouldn't there be some political constituency  
that's formed by the pork producers who are using 
more ethical standards and who are themselves  
being undercut by these Iowa farmers?
Why aren't they getting flown out to  
these congressional hearings?
That's exactly right. There is  
a large constituency of family farmers who 
support these laws because it has created a  
new market opportunity for them, where they 
can sell their already higher welfare meat  
and not be undercut by the industrial stuff.
The problem they have is that they are far  
less wealthy and organized than 
the industrial pork interests. 
They don't have the money to just fly 
themselves to D.C. They can't stop farming.  
The people who are actually doing family 
farming can't just go to D.C. and hang out  
for a week because they need to be farming 
and looking after the pigs on their farms. 
But with the meat lobbyists also, given 
that it's a commodity business, you would  
think that there wouldn't be that much surplus 
that they can dedicate to political lobbying. 
Everybody here is not doused in cash.
We can't subsidize a couple plane tickets  
for these family farmers. What's going on?
There are people who are funding some of  
these family farmers to go to Washington, 
D.C., but we could see a far bigger effort. 
That voice is being hugely 
neglected in the debate. 
The other thing I'll say on the money 
the pork industry has is that yes, it's a  
commodity business but it's also an oligopoly.
You've got a very small number of firms that  
process the vast majority of pigs, and 
they do seem to make outsized profits. 
So they don't make the kind 
of profits you would expect. 
Across these industries, we constantly see 
price-fixing scandals and other antitrust scandals  
because it's a very small number of companies.
It only requires minimal coordination for them  
to make greater profits than 
you would think they could. 
That might be good for animal welfare in the 
sense that if they can extract greater surplus,  
it makes it more possible for them to 
potentially invest in animal welfare. 
Not that they're necessarily doing 
it, but it would make it possible. 
It completely makes it possible. That's 
right. The absurdity of this is that the egg  
industry has been saying, "We can't possibly 
afford this transition to cage-free eggs." 
They, over the last few years of high 
egg prices, have made insane profits. 
How much?
Cal-Maine,  
which is the biggest egg producer, its share 
price has doubled over the last few years. 
It's because the price elasticity 
for eggs is very inelastic. 
You can just keep cranking up the price on even a 
very small reduction in supply, and you can then  
take all that surplus. They've been doing that. As 
a result, you see a whole lot of these industries  
are actually flush with cash.
But is it on the order of  
hundreds of millions, billions?
It depends on the company. A lot of the egg  
producers are actually relatively smaller.
It's the Tyson Foods and things  
that are on the billions.
But they have the money to  
do these reforms. That is not the constraint. The 
constraint is the willingness to do the reforms. 
If the majority of House members have written 
this letter, apparently saying that this should  
be taken out of the farm bill… They're 
the people who are going to vote on this. 
So why is it still going to pass?
The problem is this bill stopping  
states from regulating farm animal welfare 
meaningfully could not pass on its own. 
If it were put on the floor of the 
House and the Senate, it would lose. 
This is why they're putting it in the farm bill.
The farm bill is this huge piece of legislation  
that includes all the farm subsidies, it 
includes all the food stamp assistance. 
This is a bill that is considered 
a must-pass piece of legislation  
and is decided based on issues that most 
politicians consider far bigger than the  
issue of whether the state laws are wiped out.
What the industry is banking on is that once  
they've got this in the text of the bill, 
people aren't going to sink the bill over  
this one provision, and it will sail through 
even though it's a deeply unpopular policy. 
I want your guide on how to corrupt the 
political process in the opposite direction. 
What insights do you have on how to 
actually have an impact on how Congress  
people or state legislatures vote?
The good news here is we have public  
opinion overwhelmingly on our side.
That's good. Ease the foot in the mouth I  
caused by saying the word "corrupt."
That's right. That's right.  
We don't need to be corrupt.
The industry needs to be corrupt because  
they are trying to get politicians to do something 
that their voters strongly disapprove of. 
What we need to do is mobilize that 
base of support and show how real it is. 
We need, for instance, to 
mobilize animal welfare advocates. 
We need to mobilize farmers who 
benefit from higher welfare standards. 
We need to provide them with an equal footing 
to the footing that the industry has provided  
to the very small number of factory 
farmers who have a stake in the system. 
That requires the same 
things the industry is doing. 
It requires flying people to D.C.
It requires getting people to go and talk  
to their politicians in their local district.
Yes, it also requires money, because the  
industry is putting up so much money.
Politicians need to see that there is  
also money on the other side of this issue.
What would it actually take to… It's not clear  
what exactly you would do if you wanted 
to get this message in front of them. 
Abstractly, you can give money 
or whatever, but how does that  
actually transfer to political influence?
My sense of what the industry does is that they  
get a whole bunch of their executives 
to max out on donations to politicians. 
The politicians then give them meetings.
I wish this wasn't the way the system worked. 
I wish instead that politicians were actually 
just responsive to what the voters want. 
But given this is how the system works, I think 
that what people need to do is to bind together  
with a couple of other friends who care about this 
issue, max out on your donations to a politician,  
and then meet with the politician and say, 
"I really care about this and I'm watching  
what you do on this issue."
Frankly, you don't even need  
to just start donating.
There are a lot of people  
listening to this who probably already 
donate significant amounts to politicians. 
If they started saying to those politicians, "By 
the way, this is something I really care about,  
and I'm watching what you do on 
this issue," I think you would  
start to see the political dynamic change.
You wrote in one of your recent blog posts  
that the meat lobby spends on the order of 
$45 million in any given election cycle. 
They seem to be able to have influence on 
the topics they care about, which would be  
astounding and make all of us in tech jealous.
There are probably people listening to this  
podcast who could spend on the order 
of that kind of money on politics. 
But the ability of tech to have an 
impact on the kinds of issues that  
they care about is quite minuscule compared 
to the meat industry. What's going on here?  
What's the political economy of meat here?
It's a real puzzle. This is an industry  
that accounts for less than 1% of Americans.
It’s trying to defend wildly unpopular practices,  
and doesn't even get that much money.
Yet they somehow have this total lock  
on the legislative process where they can stop 
any animal welfare legislation from passing. 
There are a couple of things going on.
The first thing is, it's not just them. 
They are fighting alongside the 
entire agriculture industry. 
There are allied industries, like the insurance 
industry and pharma industry, that have a big  
stake in factory farming. It's not just the money. 
They appeal to this mythos of the American farmer. 
People think the American farmer is the 
good, hardworking, salt-of-the earth person. 
They sell the image of this person out in the 
fields, tending to their chickens and their pigs. 
They don't realize these are factory farmers.
And they're extremely well organized,  
they have a very formidable lobbying presence 
in Washington D.C. and across state capitals. 
They have effectively used that 
to block any kind of regulation. 
You're telling me that tech 
bros aren't as politically  
sympathetic as a salt-of-the-earth farmer?
There's this "children's kids book" rule  
of politics, which is that you should never 
mess with a character in a children's book. 
That's the police, that's the 
doctors, that's the farmers. 
I don't think there are any 
tech bros in the kids books yet. 
The front-end developers 
have yet to grace the covers. 
That’s right.
You should  
describe the sort of franchise hierarchy type 
structure of a lot of these meat companies. 
Yes, you would anticipate that the Perdues and 
Tysons of the world would want a particular thing  
to happen in terms of political processes.
But the farmers who are indebted to these  
companies often have an adversarial relationship.
Why are they able to form an effective  
political coalition with them?
This is a great point. Most people  
don't realize that the way these factory farms 
are structured is that you have these giant  
corporations like Tyson Foods or Smithfield.
They mostly don't own their own farms. 
Instead, they have these contract farmers 
who are essentially indentured laborers. 
They have a huge loan hanging over 
their head and they're farming. 
Why would those people support this?
The answer is they often don't. 
The agribusiness lobbying associations have 
done a very good job of pretending they do. 
They present themselves as 
representing the farmers. 
But if you look at their boards, if you 
look at the people who are actually leading  
these organizations, it's made up of 
people from the giant agribusinesses  
and the very largest industrial farmers.
They do not have small contract farmers  
on the boards of these organizations.
It really is a bit of a bait and switch  
where they claim to be representing 
those family farmers, but they're not. 
What is the reason that these contract farmers 
are willing to work with these large businesses? 
People will often say things like, "Uber 
is bad for Uber drivers," but I trust  
Uber drivers to know what's best for them.
Why would these small farmers be working  
with these companies in the first 
place if it's uneconomical for them? 
It depends. For some people, it is 
just the least bad option they have,  
especially if someone just has a little wee bit 
of land and they want to preserve that land and  
they don't have other skills they can use.
I was chatting with this guy, Craig Watts,  
who was a chicken contract farmer for Perdue.
He told me that when he got into the business,  
they made all these exorbitant claims to him.
They said you're going to be making over  
$100,000 within years.
They said just get out  
this loan, and it's going to be incredible.
They told him all the things that could go right. 
Then he got into the business, and they 
slowly started eroding the payments to him. 
They slowly started paying him less and less.
They slowly got to a point where he was  
making less and less money.
He wanted out, but by that  
point he couldn't get out because he had 
this giant loan hanging over his head. 
You've got a bunch of people 
who are stuck in the situation. 
There aren't easy alternatives because normally 
in one area, there will only be one processor  
that has a slaughterhouse in that area.
There's no effective competition going on. 
Also, often you're locked in 
these long-term contracts as well. 
There is an element of people being locked 
in this, and then there's an element of  
people just not having better choices.
What is the alternative use of that land? 
If you didn't work with some 
centralized processor, is the  
alternative use of that land for farming?
If you've inherited some land and you want  
to figure out what to do with 
it, what can you do with it? 
Ideally, we would see pasture-based 
farming in those places. 
It doesn't require that much land, for 
instance, to have a pasture-based chicken farm. 
The problem is you would need to find a 
processor that you could work with. Normally,  
that just doesn't exist. Normally you've only 
got the giant players in an area and they say,  
"We just want commodity production.
We don't want to fund you to  
do this pasture-raised stuff."
You get locked into that contract. 
Oftentimes, people who are doing 
pasture-raised production have to create  
their entire supply chain by themselves.
They literally have to build their own  
slaughterhouse and create their 
entire supply chain around that,  
which drives up costs massively.
Why is that? Because there must be  
enough consumers, even if it's not a majority of 
consumers, that there's some economic incentive  
to set up the economies of scale and supply 
chains that would make it easier to set up  
such a farm. Why doesn't that exist?
There are people who are trying. 
Niman Ranch, for instance, has done 
this with independent pork farmers. 
There was a big effort to do this by 
Cooks Venture with pasture-raised chicken. 
Unfortunately, they just went out of business.
The reason they went out of business is  
because there is such huge mislabeling 
across the industry that it's very hard  
to separate out what's actually better.
For instance, much factory-farmed chicken  
in the US is sold with the label "all-natural."
We know from surveys that people think all-natural  
means the chickens were outside. It actually 
means nothing. But if you're trying to sell  
your product as pasture-raised next to a 
product that says all-natural, and people  
think it means the same thing and your product 
costs $2 more, you're not going to get very far. 
So long as we have this rampant mislabeling, it's 
very hard for the other players to get ahead. 
There's normal bananas and 
there's organic bananas. 
People are willing to pay quite 
a bit more for organic bananas. 
I feel like "pasture-raised" should be 
in a similar embedding space as organic. 
Organic is a huge industry even though it 
has dubious medical benefits, et cetera. 
Then the problem is not that if 
there were accurate labeling,  
you'd think there might be consumer demand 
to make this a viable, much larger industry. 
It's just that it's very hard for 
consumers to identify which is which. 
Yes. You actually see that 
in the egg sector in the US. 
Within eggs, there is clearer labeling.
Cage-free actually means something,  
pasture-raised actually means something.
You can't just put the all-natural label on. 
What we see is that the pasture-raised 
egg sector is growing rapidly. 
Even then, it is still handicapped by 
the fact that supermarkets use this  
as a price differentiation tool.
They know that wealthier consumers  
prefer pasture-based eggs and are also less 
price-sensitive, so they mark them up heavily. 
The price you see is way inflated 
beyond the actual cost difference. 
Yet still, that is a rapidly growing sector.
This is one thing I wanted to ask you about. 
One point you've often made is that you have to 
understand that meat and agriculture generally  
is a commodity business.
In a commodity business,  
you'd expect all margins to be competed away.
I think you said in one of your blog posts that  
it costs 19 cents more for a dozen eggs to 
be cage-free, but often chains will charge  
on the order of $1.70 more for cage-free eggs.
If it's a commodity business, why is it possible  
for supermarkets to extract this extra margin?
This is the non-commodity part of the industry. 
The broader context on those retailers is 
that almost all the top US retailers have  
made pledges to stop selling eggs from caged hens.
A lot of them were meant to do that by this year,  
and a lot of them have not done it.
Walmart and Kroger have not followed through. 
What they say is, "Our 
consumers don't want cage-free  
eggs because they're way more expensive."
And it's true, they're way more expensive. 
They're selling them for like a 
dollar to two dollars more per dozen. 
When you look at the underlying production 
costs, it's only 19 cents difference. 
What we see is these retailers are using 
this as an opportunity to get a big markup  
with less price-sensitive consumers and 
are in the process massively hampering  
their ability to fulfill their commitments.
By contrast, Costco went 100% cage-free. 
They followed through on their promise.
What we see is they are now selling cage-free  
eggs for the same price as Walmart sells its 
caged eggs. There is that competitive pressure.  
Once cage-free becomes the new baseline, 
it does become the commodity market and you  
do see those margins competed away.
It’s the same thing in states where  
they've banned the sale of caged eggs.
Cage-free eggs now cost the same thing  
as the caged eggs cost next door.
You do see that competed away once  
it becomes a commodity.
It's until it reaches that  
point that you're seeing these crazy margins.
Interesting. If these companies are already  
making these commitments, in many cases following 
through on them, to move towards more ethical  
ways of procuring meat, procuring eggs, etc….
I think I learned from you that McDonald's has  
made these commitments or that Chipotle has made 
these commitments. I didn't learn from McDonald's.  
What is the reason that this is not a more 
prominent part of their own advertising,  
given how much consumers care and how 
universally popular animal welfare is? 
The very best companies are advertising 
this, like Vital Farms or NestFresh eggs. 
They are out front focusing on the 
animal welfare benefits because  
they're pasture-raised and it looks amazing.
The fundamental problem for the large-scale  
companies is they have just made things less bad.
It's still really good what they're doing. 
Moving from caged to cage-free is incredible. But 
there are two problems. One is, their consumers  
already thought they weren't using caged eggs.
So if they advertise, "Hey, we're cage-free  
now," everyone's like, "What?
What were you doing all this time? 
You didn't tell us you were using caged eggs."
And people still might think that even the new  
reality is not as good as what 
they thought things should be. 
They still would rather the animals 
were going outside, which they're not. 
And in a lot of cases, there 
are these phase-ins over time. 
So McDonald's is like, "In 10 years' time, 
we're going to get rid of the caged eggs." 
You don't want to advertise that too loudly 
because then people are going to be for the  
next 10 years, "I'm eating caged eggs, 
and I didn't know that previously." 
That is just the unfortunate dynamic.
Because this dissonance is so great  
between current practices and reality, that 
merely getting rid of the worst practices is  
not enough to create an advertising claim.
Given how fast you're able to secure these  
commitments from different corporations, 
from retailers to restaurants, etc. 
It seems like corporate campaigns are even 
more successful than policy. Corporations are  
much more receptive. Obviously Perdue 
and Tyson are corporations as well. 
But the rest of the actual industry of getting 
food to consumers just seems incredibly receptive  
to these kinds of pressure campaigns.
Maybe that's a lever of change that's  
especially salient.
It's been phenomenally  
successful with these consumer facing brands, 
like the retailers, the fast food chains. 
Advocates have been able to secure over 3,000 
corporate animal welfare pledges now globally,  
including from all the biggest retailers, 
all the biggest fast food chains, affecting  
hundreds of millions of animals.
The reason for that is twofold. 
The first is, there's a totally 
different structure from the  
structure in place on the legislative side.
On the legislative side, if you want to pass an  
animal welfare reform in Congress or in any state 
legislature, it goes to the Agriculture Committee. 
The Agriculture Committee is dominated 
by a bunch of people who are in the  
pocket of big Ag, and they kill the bill.
It never even gets out of that committee,  
let alone getting to the whole legislature.
If you go to a company, you go to someone who  
is a decision maker who is not being lobbied by 
industry, or if they are being lobbied, is far  
less susceptible to that lobbying than they are.
I also think companies have just proven  
more responsive to consumers than 
politicians are to their voters. 
I think politicians have decided that they 
need to be responsive on the 10 issues their  
voters care most about. Maybe it's fewer than 
that. But on low salience issues like this,  
they can just ignore what their voters 
want and do what their donors are telling  
them what to do or what's easier to do.
Whereas I think what corporations are  
finding is, actually, if consumers are really 
outraged about this, then we need to act. 
Maybe this is higher on the list of salience 
for consumers at a retailer, because they're  
not worried about what their taxation policy is.
For a retailer, actually, what is the quality  
of the goods you are selling?
That is a pretty critical factor. 
We know from surveys that when 
it comes to sustainability,  
animal welfare is the top thing people care about.
So for all this talk we see from companies about  
climate change and prioritizing climate change, 
both the McDonald's and the Tysons and so on,  
they've all said this is the thing 
that consumers actually care about. 
Then what is the reason that the animal welfare 
movement has gotten so wrapped up with that? 
You go to most landing pages for animal 
welfare stuff and it'll be, "We're improving  
animal lives and we're making farming 
more sustainable. We're addressing climate  
change." That just seems really strange to me.
Okay, we're torturing tens of billions of animals  
a year, but then also we're reducing emissions.
We'll figure out some other way to reduce  
emissions, right? Whatever. How did this 
become the same issue in the first place? 
There's been this weird conflating. There's 
even been this very cynical exploitation  
of the climate issue by producers 
to not do animal welfare reforms. 
So something that Tyson Foods will say is, 
"We can't move to these higher welfare breeds  
because they would have a slightly bigger carbon 
footprint, because they eat a little bit more. 
Also, if you let the animals move around a lot, 
they expend more calories and that's got a bigger  
carbon footprint." It's this total absurdity. I 
had a conversation with the SVP for sustainability  
at one of the largest meat companies.
What they told me was, "Yes, we know  
from internal surveys that animal welfare 
is actually more important to consumers. 
But we are far more responsive to what the fast 
food companies and the investors are telling us. 
And the fast food companies and the 
investors are obsessed with climate." 
The ESG stuff?
The ESG stuff. I think they've all  
made these targets that they need to implement.
Those targets are getting much higher priority  
than the targets they made on animal welfare.
But then why do animal charities… It's not just  
a cynical attempt by the meat industry.
If you go to animal charity websites,  
they'll often also emphasize 
sustainability on their landing page. 
I understand other people's 
psychologies are different, so  
I don't want to project the way I think about it.
At least whenever I see that, I'm like, "Oh wait,  
are you actually optimizing for the thing 
that makes this a really salient issue for me? 
Or are you just going to optimize for carbon 
footprint rather than this incredible amount of  
suffering that this industry produces?"
So why are they doing this? 
Why have your friends roped 
sustainability into this area? 
I think a lot of people care 
about multiple things, right? 
They care about animal welfare and 
they care about sustainability. 
It is true that in certain cases, 
these things go hand in hand. 
Alternative proteins are both better 
for animal welfare and have a smaller  
environmental footprint. They are more 
sustainable. This is not always the case. 
One thing that is wild to me is where 
you have people out there telling  
people to switch from beef to chicken 
because it's better for the climate. 
Literally that switch is 23 more animals per 
year you'll be consuming, costing several  
years worth of suffering in these factory 
farms, for a pretty marginal climate impact. 
I do think there is often this tendency 
that climate just gets total precedence. 
It's just seen as obviously more important 
than any number of animals suffering. 
I actually think that that is more of an elite 
narrative than it is what regular people think. 
I actually think regular people 
are just pretty horrified by  
animal suffering and do prioritize that.
Lewis, thank you so much for coming on the  
podcast and thank you for the work you do.
You are allocating the largest amount of  
philanthropic funding in this space.
You're a cheery fellow but I'm sure,  
day in and day out, this is not pleasant work 
to do, to learn about these gruesome details  
and how we can make the situation better.
But it's awesome that you're doing it. 
Thank you for coming on, 
and thank you for your work. 
Thank you very much. And thank you 
for both being willing to take on  
this tough topic on your podcast and for 
making such a generous donation match. 
I'm really excited about the 
impact you can have there. 
Cool.
Awesome.
