All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 close.


It
 is
 Friday,
 December
 5th.
 We
 are
 live.


And
 well,
 you
 didn't
 have
 that
 much


crazy
 stuff
 happen
 throughout
 the
 day.
 I


mean,
 S&P
 500
 relatively
 flat.
 We
 did


get
 a
 big
 move
 almost
 in
 the
 morning


above
 688,
 68839.
 We
 are
 right
 back
 to


685.
 So,
 realistically,
 the
 the
 move


that
 we
 got
 in
 the
 morning,
 which
 was
 um


pretty
 bullish,
 basically
 flattened
 out.


And
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 been


a
 overall
 good
 week
 up
 about
 1.2%
 so
 I


can't
 complain
 too
 much.
 Um,
 but
 there


weren't
 that
 many
 crazy
 headlines
 or


swings
 on
 this
 type
 of
 a
 Friday.
 And
 you


know,
 most
 of
 the
 stuff
 that
 needed
 to


happen
 throughout
 the
 week
 kind
 of


happened.
 PCE
 in
 the
 morning
 was


important.
 Came
 in
 line
 with


expectations
 in
 some
 respects
 were
 even


better
 than
 expectations.
 Market


ultimately
 didn't
 go
 up
 or
 down
 based
 on


the
 news.
 Uh,
 but
 it
 was
 what
 you
 needed


to
 kind
 of
 keep
 the
 market
 stable.


Meta's
 up
 1.72%.
 Robin
 Hood
 lost
 about


4%
 as
 Bitcoin
 came
 down.
 Nvidia
 could


not
 break
 above
 184.
 Netflix
 right
 back


down
 3%.
 We'll
 talk
 more
 about
 this


Netflix
 Warner
 Brothers
 stuff
 today.
 Uh,


which
 was
 the
 big
 announcement
 of
 the


morning.
 Stock
 for
 Netflix
 is
 down
 3%


and
 when
 Steve
 joins
 the
 show,
 we'll
 get


his
 take
 on
 that.
 Palenteer
 broke


through
 182
 right
 now
 at
 18164.
 That's


up
 about
 2%.
 Salesforce
 and
 Adobe
 great


days.
 Those
 Salesforce
 now
 reacting


after
 earnings
 and
 Adobe
 reacting
 before


their
 earnings.
 So,
 you're
 getting


Salesforce
 and
 Adobe
 getting
 some
 more


momentum.
 And
 then
 Warner
 Brothers


actually
 catching
 up
 to
 the
 price
 that


they
 need
 to
 be
 sold
 at
 at
 2750.
 Right


now,
 it's
 at
 26.
 Netflix
 is
 down.
 Warner


Brothers
 up.
 So
 maybe
 the
 market's


pricing
 in
 more
 of
 a
 shot
 that
 Netflix


ends
 up
 completing
 this
 acquisition
 as


Warner
 Bros.
 is
 getting
 closer
 to
 that


acquisition
 price
 and
 obviously
 Netflix


would
 go
 down
 if
 they
 have
 to
 pay
 that


money.
 Um,
 but
 this
 might
 be
 a
 much


longer
 story
 than
 just
 today
 to
 see
 when


this
 plays
 out
 from
 a
 regulatory


perspective.
 Tesla
 right
 here
 at
 454.


That's
 green.
 Ethereum
 begging
 to
 hold


on
 to
 3,000.
 I
 didn't
 even
 see
 it
 fell


below
 three.
 Look
 at
 that.
 29.86
 it


bounced
 off
 of.
 And
 then
 Bitcoin
 when
 I


left
 we
 were
 at
 91
 and
 now
 we're
 back
 at


89.
 So,
 Bitcoin
 continues
 to
 oscillate


around
 this
 85
 to
 93
 type
 of
 range.
 In


terms
 of
 S&P
 500,
 so
 I'm
 going
 to
 have


to
 say
 this
 pretty
 much
 throughout
 the


entire
 show,
 but
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 new


people
 will
 be
 joining.
 The
 results
 will


not
 be
 out
 until
 5:15
 p.m.
 Eastern.
 5:15


p.m.
 Eastern.
 In
 fact,
 I'll
 just
 pin


that
 comment
 right
 here


for
 SNP
 inclusion
 results.


So,
 for
 those
 that
 only
 care
 about
 that,


you're
 just
 going
 to
 have
 to
 wait
 about


an
 hour,


hour
 and
 a
 half.
 Um,
 and
 then
 we
 will


see
 what
 those
 earnings
 look
 like
 or
 not


earnings,
 but
 what
 the
 rebounds
 looks


like.
 The
 companies
 that
 could
 get
 in.


So,
 there's
 a
 couple
 candidates
 I
 think


some
 people
 forgot
 that
 could
 um
 that


could
 get
 in.
 Marll
 is
 on
 the
 list
 to


get
 in.
 I
 didn't
 even
 realize
 they


weren't
 in
 the
 S&P
 500.
 Carvana
 is
 on


the
 list
 to
 get
 in.
 Carvana
 back
 at
 $400


a
 share.
 And
 then
 in
 the
 morning
 we


talked
 about
 Reddit,
 Micro
 Strategy,


Viva
 Systems,
 VRT,
 Liquid
 Cooling
 Play


for
 Data
 Centers,
 which
 is
 up
 about
 3.2%


on
 the
 day,
 1884.
 A
 lot
 of
 these
 names


actually
 are
 up
 and
 maybe
 they're
 either


previewing
 an
 S&P
 500
 inclusion.
 Reddit,


look
 at
 that,
 up
 5%
 on
 the
 day,
 which


could
 be
 uh
 could
 be
 the
 signal
 or
 it


could
 be
 noise
 if
 this
 doesn't
 actually


happen.
 Viva's
 flat.
 And
 then
 SoFi
 after


that
 $ 1.5
 billion
 dilution
 down
 about


6.6%.
 This
 one
 also
 didn't
 really


recover
 from
 the
 dilution
 that
 it
 had


last
 time.


So,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 this
 ends
 up


playing
 out,
 but
 we
 will
 know
 basically


in
 the
 next
 hour.
 I
 don't
 think
 Coree
 is


eligible
 to
 get
 in.
 I
 mean,
 maybe
 they


are.
 Coreweave,
 they
 went
 public.


No,
 they
 went
 public
 this
 year.
 That's


going
 to
 be
 a
 little
 tough.
 They're
 not


a
 2024
 IPO.
 They
 were
 like
 March
 of
 this


year,
 right?
 Yeah.
 I
 I
 think
 that's


going
 to
 be
 a
 little
 harder
 for
 them
 to


get
 in.
 Uh
 but
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 and


ultimately


it
 will
 obviously
 make
 an
 impact
 on
 some


of
 these
 companies.
 Again,
 for
 SoFi,


this
 would
 be
 the
 one
 for
 all
 of
 us
 that


would
 be
 awesome
 to
 get
 in.
 Just
 a


question
 of
 if
 they
 have
 a
 shot.
 Fix


that's
 another
 one
 that
 is
 eligible
 as


well.
 Comfort
 Systems,
 this
 is
 a
 34


billion
 $35
 billion
 company.
 Um
 HVAC
 is


what
 they
 mainly
 focus
 on.
 They're
 up


133%
 year
 to
 date.
 So
 there
 might
 be


some
 names
 that
 get
 included
 that
 a
 lot


of
 people
 just
 don't
 know
 that
 much


about.
 They're
 not
 like
 sort
 of the
 hot


names
 people
 talk
 about.
 But


if
 they
 do
 get
 in,
 obviously
 that
 would


be
 very
 good
 for
 those
 shareholders
 in


those
 names.
 So
 that's
 what
 you
 have
 on


S&P.
 And
 again,
 we
 will
 find
 out
 over


the
 coming
 hour
 what
 ends
 up
 happening.


Uh
 big
 headline
 on
 Elon's
 space
 company.


Thought
 this
 was
 kind
 of
 inevitable,
 but


it
 looks
 like
 it
 is
 officially


happening.
 not
 confirmed
 by
 the
 company


yet,
 but
 as
 for
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal,


secondary
 share
 at
 an
 $800
 billion


valuation
 for
 SpaceX.
 So,
 for
 anyone
 who


has
 SpaceX
 on
 the
 private
 market,
 SpaceX


is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 uh
 liquid
 private


market
 stocks.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


ways
 to
 get
 access
 to
 SpaceX,
 even
 if


you're
 not
 an
 accredited
 investor.
 So,


you
 can
 put
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you
 own
 this


one.
 I
 know
 Suchin,
 who's
 friend
 of
 the


channel,
 has
 owned
 this
 for
 a
 long
 time.


I
 think
 he's
 up
 like
 more
 than
 5x
 on
 it.


But
 SpaceX
 right
 there
 beginning
 a


secondary
 share
 at
 an
 $800
 billion


valuation,
 hundred
 billion
 dollar


valuation.
 That
 would
 be
 more
 valuable


than
 OpenAI
 and
 it
 would
 officially
 be


the
 most
 private
 the
 the
 largest
 private


startup
 right
 now.
 OpenAI
 currently
 has


that
 uh
 that
 valuation.


And
 so
 I
 think
 bullish
 Rocket
 Lab
 if


SpaceX
 can
 get
 that
 type
 of
 valuation,


bullish
 AS,
 I
 mean
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 names


could
 get
 some
 a
 little
 of
 that


momentum.
 Rocket
 Lab
 there.
 Wow.
 4940


rockab
 potentially
 closing
 just
 under
 50


on
 the
 day.
 Got
 about
 9
 minutes
 until


the
 close.
 S&P


I
 got
 a
 red
 candle.
 She
 might
 end
 up


going
 red.
 But
 it
 is
 nice
 to
 see
 that


the
 space
 names
 are
 getting
 a
 lot
 of


respect
 and
 that
 could
 be
 something
 very


big
 for
 SpaceX.
 68470.


She
 tricked
 us
 this
 morning.
 She
 got
 to


68.
 She
 got
 like
 70
 cents
 away
 from


alltime
 highs
 and
 she
 tricked
 us.


But
 she
 was
 not
 able
 to
 get
 above
 that


level.
 Yes,
 Google
 also
 owns
 8%
 of


SpaceX.
 So
 that
 would
 be
 a
 massive


increase
 on
 Google
 on
 their
 stake
 which


on
 ironically
 their
 stake
 I
 think
 four


quarters
 ago
 was
 the
 reason
 why
 Google


massively
 beat
 EPS
 by
 40%.
 Because
 they


actually
 realized
 it
 on
 their
 balance


sheet
 even
 if
 they
 didn't
 sell
 the
 stock


and
 you
 know
 that
 could
 be
 something


that
 helps
 them
 going
 into
 the
 future
 as


well.


So
 we
 are
 going
 to
 see
 what
 happens


there.
 A
 that's
 another
 candidate
 for


S&P
 500
 inclusions.
 I
 did
 see
 this


ticker
 getting
 thrown
 out.
 ARS


Management
 Corporation,
 $55
 billion


company.
 There's
 a
 variety
 of
 tickers


that
 are
 floating
 around
 as
 eligible.


Um,
 they
 are
 private
 credit,


kind
 of
 like
 a
 KKR,
 Apollo.


I
 think
 both
 of
 those
 are
 in
 the
 S&P


500.
 So,
 yes,
 ARS
 management,
 Aries


management,
 they
 also
 have
 a
 shot
 of


getting
 in.
 And
 then


and
 then
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 yes,
 you
 can


buy
 Android
 through
 the
 private
 markets.


Again,
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 just
 the
 valuation


you're
 going
 to
 be
 paying,
 which
 is
 more


aggressive.
 Hive
 is
 the
 platform
 that
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 use.
 H
 IV,
 you
 do


have
 to
 prove
 you're
 an
 accredited


investor
 on
 that
 platform,
 but
 you're


just
 going to
 be
 paying
 a
 lot.
 Now,
 if


it
 goes
 public
 and
 you
 double
 your


money,
 you
 might
 not
 care,
 but
 like


relative
 to
 how
 people
 get
 into
 these


deals,
 some
 of these
 secondary
 platforms


just
 charge
 you
 a
 higher
 fee
 and
 you


know,
 that's
 kind
 of
 how
 they
 make
 their


money.
 Amcore
 right
 there,
 4333,
 that's


up
 27%.
 Iran
 was
 down
 about
 3.4%.
 Nebius


was
 also
 down
 4.3.
 Bitcoin
 again
 89324


and
 then
 Ethereum
 at
 320.
 Take
 a
 look
 at


this.
 This
 is
 another
 chart
 that
 has


been
 going
 around
 for
 global
 monthly


active
 users
 uh
 from
 sensor
 tower
 data


which
 is
 this
 firm
 that
 essentially
 has


a
 proprietary
 model
 that
 tracks
 all
 the


usage
 of
 these
 platforms.
 Chatbt
 at
 810


million
 365
 copilot
 for
 Microsoft
 212


million.
 Gemini
 346
 million.
 Perplexity


45
 million.
 Grock
 34
 million
 then
 claude


at
 11
 million.
 Now
 some
 of
 these
 numbers


are
 a
 bit
 different
 than
 what
 the


companies
 themselves
 have
 said.


Obviously
 the
 company's
 word
 is
 a
 bit


more
 important
 here
 and
 they're
 going
 to


probably
 have
 an
 update.
 Also
 there's


another
 rumor
 coming
 out
 that
 chachi


6
 or
 5.5
 or
 whatever
 you
 want
 to
 call
 it


is
 coming
 out
 next
 week.
 So
 uh
 a
 new


model
 is
 getting
 ready
 to
 come.
 But
 the


point
 of
 these
 numbers
 is
 that
 more
 and


more
 people
 are
 using
 these
 products


which
 is
 very
 very
 important
 for
 the


overall
 usage
 of
 the
 industry.
 If
 we


were
 to
 get
 a
 new
 GPT
 model,
 I
 think


that
 would
 be
 very
 very
 exciting
 simply


because
 of
 the
 fact
 that,
 you
 know,


Gemini
 3
 right
 now
 is
 taking
 the
 the


cake
 of
 like
 the
 best
 model
 that
 people


actually
 care
 about.
 Um,
 and
 obviously


Altman
 has
 no
 shot
 unless
 he
 has
 a


better
 model
 and
 all
 of
 us
 as
 investors


are
 going
 to
 see
 if
 they
 can
 actually


put
 up
 that
 better
 model
 going
 into
 the


end
 of
 the
 year
 and
 that
 would


definitely
 be
 a
 good
 way
 for
 them
 to


compete
 going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year


as
 well.
 Amazon
 right
 there
 229
 0.09


09%.
 You
 know
 what
 this
 day
 feels
 like?


It
 feels
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 have


covered
 calls
 that
 are
 getting
 saved.


Like
 if
 you
 had
 Robin
 Hood
 135
 covered


calls,
 you're
 getting
 saved.
 If
 you
 have


Amazon
 232
 covered
 calls,
 you're
 getting


saved.
 Video
 185,
 you're
 getting
 saved.


Like
 BMR
 right
 there,
 that's
 down
 about


5%
 based
 on
 ETH
 price
 action.
 But
 if
 you


had
 covered
 calls
 on
 some
 of
 these
 names


on
 Rubric,
 you're
 probably
 getting


screwed
 on
 the
 cover
 calls.
 Rubric
 hit


90
 at
 one
 point.
 Dude,
 look
 at
 that.
 22%


on
 the
 day,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 finishing


just
 below


those
 levels.
 S&P
 announcement
 is
 at


5:15
 p.m.
 Eastern.


5:15
 p.m.
 Eastern.


Um,


we
 will
 get
 that
 announcement.
 It
 might


happen
 at
 5:20.
 Dude,
 there's
 there's


another
 probability.
 We
 might
 not
 get


the
 announcement.
 last
 time
 in
 June,
 uh,


for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 three
 years,
 the


S&P
 didn't
 do
 any
 rebalance,
 which
 I


just
 felt
 like
 was
 a
 troll.


Uh,


I
 was
 like,
 really?
 In
 three
 years,


you're
 not
 there's
 no
 companies
 that


need
 to
 get
 out
 of
 the
 S&P?
 That's


that's
 quite
 incredible.
 Um,
 so
 maybe


that
 happens
 this
 time.
 I
 think
 it's


less
 likely,


but
 if
 we
 don't
 get
 an
 answer
 by
 like


5:30,
 then
 we
 know
 that
 maybe
 they're


not
 doing
 a
 rebalance.


And
 so
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 going
 into
 the


end
 of
 today
 what
 ends
 up
 happening.
 My


SoFi
 covered
 calls
 were
 cooked.
 Yeah,


SoFi
 definitely
 did
 everybody
 a
 solid


with
 that
 dilution.
 If
 you
 had
 2850,


28,
 29.
 Now
 granted,
 if
 they
 get
 in


maybe
 I
 mean
 there's
 four
 minutes
 left.


I
 don't
 know if
 you
 can
 close
 them,
 but


see
 the
 thing
 is
 if
 let's
 say
 you
 have
 a


28
 covered
 call
 and
 then
 after
 hours


SoFi
 shoots
 up
 to
 29
 for
 whatever


reason,
 maybe
 because
 they
 got
 into
 the


S&P
 500,
 those
 shares
 probably
 get


called
 away.
 We've
 seen
 this
 happen


many,
 many
 times.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 giving


back
 a
 couple
 hundred
 bucks
 just
 to


potentially
 save
 your
 shares
 if
 they


were
 to
 get
 in
 is
 not
 the
 worst
 idea,


but
 it
 all
 depends
 on
 them
 getting
 in.


And
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 later
 if
 that


ends
 up
 taking
 place.
 My
 Soapi
 leaps
 are


also
 gone.


Dude,
 Nod
 is
 going
 to
 get
 paid
 half
 a


billion
 at
 45.
 We've
 got
 to
 imagine
 that


uh


that
 he's
 he's
 got
 a
 plan,
 right?
 Like


he's
 not
 some
 random
 CEO
 that
 has
 no


idea


um


what
 he's
 doing.
 And
 it's
 not
 like
 they


need
 the
 money.
 So
 like
 like
 like
 a
 like


a
 desperate
 meme
 stock.
 So
 I
 think


there's
 something
 deeper.


I
 think
 there's
 something
 deeper.
 Can


you
 please
 sell
 Tanner
 a
 bell?
 He
 keeps


using
 his
 water
 bell.
 Yeah,
 I
 know.


Tanner
 did
 the
 close
 yesterday
 and
 he


uses
 water
 bottle.
 He's
 got
 to
 get
 a
 I


got
 to
 send
 him
 a
 bell.
 I
 got
 to
 legit


send
 him
 a
 bell
 because
 the
 days
 that
 I


can't
 do
 it,
 he
 needs
 to
 like
 ring
 the


bell
 at
 the
 close.


His
 water
 bottle
 is
 a
 good
 attempt,
 but


we
 need
 a
 legit
 bell.
 Matt
 has
 had
 a


great
 day.
 673.
 I
 mean,
 this
 stock
 was


at
 585
 two
 weeks
 ago
 and
 it
 was
 at
 620


on
 Monday.
 So,
 anyone
 who's
 really


taking
 advantage
 of
 the
 metadip
 at


scale,
 you've
 been
 heavily
 rewarded
 and


that
 is
 a
 long
 candidate
 going
 into
 2026


along
 with
 I
 think
 Amazon


and
 Nvidia.
 Meta
 stock
 year
 to
 date
 now


12%.
 It
 was
 3%
 last
 week,


so
 now
 we're
 at
 12%.
 New
 bank.
 Yep.
 New


bank
 also
 doing
 great.
 16
 well
 down


today.
 It
 was
 doing
 great.
 It
 was
 a


1782.
 Well,
 this
 one's
 also
 like,
 hey,


you
 know,
 it
 hit
 all-time
 highs.
 Gonna


take
 a
 breather.
 It's
 like
 a
 lot
 of


these
 stocks
 when
 you
 get
 that
 big
 of
 a


move,
 you
 know,
 people
 are
 going
 to
 take


profits.
 And
 if
 people
 are
 going
 to
 take


profits,
 that's
 okay.
 But
 that
 can


definitely
 affect
 the
 stocks
 to
 the


to
 the
 downside.
 All
 right,

 minutes.


Let's
 see
 how
 we
 end
 up
 getting
 this


close.
 Again,
 PCE
 for
 those
 that
 missed


it.
 2.8
 versus
 2.8
 expected.
 68550
 on


the
 S&P
 up
 0.16%


uh
 for
 the
 week
 if
 the
 S&P
 was
 going
 to


close
 at
 these
 levels.


We
 would
 be
 up
 1%.


Yeah,
 pound
 is
 up
 2%
 as
 well.
 We
 would


be
 up
 1%
 for
 the
 week


and
 that
 would
 be
 better.
 They
 should
 do


these
 S&P
 rebounces
 on
 Wednesdays
 and


not
 Fridays
 because
 the
 options
 market.


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 it's
 always
 been
 weird
 kind


of
 how
 they
 announced
 them
 and
 also
 they


just
 have
 such
 an
 archaic
 way
 of


announcing
 it.
 Like
 everyone's


refreshing
 a
 website
 for
 no
 like
 this


should
 be
 such
 such
 a
 modern
 process
 and


it's
 not.


But
 unfortunately


that's
 how
 you're
 seeing
 it.
 Grab
 also


down
 on
 the
 day
 again
 for
 Grab.
 I
 think


the
 number
 one
 thing
 to
 remember
 is
 that


until
 they
 get
 clarity
 on
 what's
 going


on
 with
 goto
 I
 think
 this
 stock
 is
 going


to
 continue
 to
 be
 red.
 So
 519
 I
 think
 is


deeply
 deeply
 undervalued.
 I
 don't
 think


it
 makes
 much
 sense
 for
 the
 company
 but


nonetheless
 they
 have
 a
 narrative


attached
 to
 them
 right
 now.
 In
 a
 couple


weeks
 that
 narrative
 potentially
 changes


and
 so
 until
 it
 does
 you
 know
 you're


likely
 going
 to
 have
 investors
 keeping


it
 at
 those
 levels
 and
 we
 have
 to
 see


how
 it
 ultimately
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.

 Do

 don't

Do
 we
 have

 No,
 there

 be


no

Oh,
 that's
 a
 headline.
 DOJ
 expected
 to


investigate
 Netflix's
 bid
 for
 Warner


Brothers
 with
 regulators
 already


examining
 how
 the
 deal
 could
 cement


Netflix
 dominance.
 Wow.


I
 mean,
 that
 is
 quite
 incredible
 that


this
 continues
 to
 become
 a
 thing
 for


Netflix.
 Let's
 get
 some
 coverage
 on


Netflix
 and
 we'll
 get
 through
 a
 bunch
 of


other
 headlines
 that
 we
 have.
 But
 Josh


Brown,
 the
 person
 who
 sold
 Google
 to
 buy


Netflix
 today,
 has
 trimmed
 85%
 of
 his


Netflix
 and
 watch
 this
 become
 a


political
 football
 and
 tie
 up
 capital.


So,
 it's
 just
 a
 um
 it's
 just
 a
 a


portfolio
 management
 decision.
 Um
 I


think
 there
 going
 to
 be
 other


opportunities
 that
 have
 more
 near-term


upside
 while
 this
 Netflix
 thing
 works


its
 way
 through
 the
 uh
 the
 meat
 grinder


in
 Washington.
 I
 want
 I
 want
 everyone
 to


understand
 I
 think
 Netflix
 right
 now


represents
 a
 tremendous
 value,
 but
 I


don't
 think
 the
 stock
 will
 be
 able
 to


get
 out
 of
 its
 own
 way.
 The
 thing
 to


keep
 in
 mind
 here
 is
 we
 don't
 know
 if
 an


over-the-top
 bid
 comes.
 We
 don't
 know


what
 Republicans
 are
 going
 to
 want
 to


talk
 about
 as
 as
 it
 pertains
 to
 this.
 We


don't
 know
 what
 the
 Democrats
 will
 want


to
 talk
 about.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


antitrust
 uh
 there's
 a
 big
 antitrust


contingent
 in
 both
 parties
 for
 different


reasons.
 Then
 of
 course
 there's
 the


White
 House.
 This
 would
 be
 the
 second


largest
 merger
 or
 acquisition
 in
 the


post-pandemic
 period
 worldwide
 other


than
 Norfolk
 Southern
 and
 Union
 Pacific.


the
 railroad
 tie
 up
 at
 85
 billion.
 You


cannot
 tell
 me
 um
 the
 eye
 of
 Sauron
 is


not
 going
 to
 see
 this
 thing
 happening


and
 say
 what
 can
 we
 what
 what
 does
 this


mean
 for
 us?
 And
 keep
 in
 mind
 this
 is


media
 so
 it
 probably
 means
 something.


I'm
 not
 telling
 you
 they
 have
 to
 put
 the


apprentice
 back
 on
 the
 air
 or
 it's
 going


to
 be
 something
 like
 that.
 But
 don't
 be


surprised
 that
 this
 takes
 over
 a
 year


produced
 by
 Baron.
 This
 this
 could
 take


over
 a
 year.
 So
 look
 I
 celebrity
 I
 have


tons
 of
 gonna
 be
 the
 remedy.
 Yeah,


>> right.
 I
 have
 tons
 of
 Right.
 Ma
 Ma
 Maga


Apprentice.
 So,
 all
 all
 I'm
 saying
 is
 I


think
 Netflix
 is
 a
 great
 value.
 I
 think


it's
 a
 great
 deal.
 I
 actually
 love
 the


deal
 for
 them.
 Not
 only
 for
 them,
 but
 I


love
 that
 they're
 keeping
 this
 out
 of


the
 hands
 of
 somebody
 else.
 Equally


important
 in
 the
 streaming
 wars.
 Um,
 but


I
 can't
 sit
 here.
 So,
 I
 I
 kept
 a
 very


small
 position
 on
 and
 we'll
 we'll
 see


what
 happens.
 We'll
 I
 we'll
 watch
 it
 for


the
 next
 12
 to
 18
 months.
 See
 how
 this


goes.


>> I
 thought
 some
 of
 the
 Kev,
 you
 have
 the


stock,
 too.
 I
 thought
 some
 of
 the
 notes


from
 the
 street
 today
 about
 the


strategic
 nature
 of
 the
 the
 deal
 and
 how


it's
 a
 departure
 for
 Netflix
 from
 how
 it


has
 historically
 done
 things.
 Uh
 Huber


Research
 says,
 "We've
 had
 an
 overweight


for
 nearly
 the
 entire
 time
 over
 the
 last


10
 years,
 but
 are
 stepping
 aside.


Netflix
 has
 been
 very
 successful
 the


last
 15
 plus
 years
 developing
 its
 own


content
 and
 has
 smartly
 stayed
 away
 from


doing
 sizable
 deals.
 We
 do
 not
 see
 the


need
 to
 change
 that."
 Baird
 weighs
 in


today.
 Certainly
 a
 deviation
 from
 the


company's
 historical
 approach
 and
 we


understand
 the
 initial
 investor


hesitation
 regarding
 the
 size
 of
 this


deal
 and
 the
 potential
 closing


integration
 process,
 but
 we
 suspect
 the


long-term
 benefits
 will
 ultimately


outweigh
 the
 near-term
 risks
 risks.
 You


as
 a
 shareholder
 have
 to
 be
 willing
 to


sit
 for
 the
 long
 haul.
 You
 have
 to
 have


a
 bigger
 vision.
 But
 the
 notion
 that


this
 is
 historically
 different
 than
 what


Netflix
 is
 used
 to
 doing,
 not
 unlike
 you


might
 hear
 if
 Apple
 was
 to
 make
 an


acquisition
 of
 some
 scale
 larger
 than


it's
 ever
 done
 before,
 you'd
 probably


have
 similar
 notes.


>> I
 hope
 we
 do
 see
 that
 from
 Apple,
 Scott,


and
 I'm
 thrilled
 to
 see
 it
 from
 Netflix.


I'm
 going
 to
 take
 the
 other
 side
 of


this.
 I
 think
 it's
 incredibly
 um


wonderful
 to
 see
 them
 go
 on
 the


offensive.
 this
 is
 a
 an
 IP
 play
 that
 if


the
 deal
 were
 to
 go
 through
 and
 I
 agree


with
 all
 the
 notes
 and
 Josh's
 comments


that
 the
 likelihood
 is
 pretty
 thin.
 I


also
 think
 that
 we'll
 see
 a
 competitive


bid
 from
 Paramount
 Skyworks
 to
 excuse
 me


a
 hostile
 bid
 from
 them
 to
 to
 to
 keep


this
 deal
 alive.
 But
 if
 it
 did
 happen,


you
 kind
 of
 think
 of
 it
 like
 the
 Disney


deal
 when
 they
 bought
 Star
 Wars
 and
 when


they
 bought
 Marvel.
 When
 you're
 talking


about
 some
 of
 these
 franchises,
 Game
 of


Thrones,
 The
 Sopranos,
 the
 DC
 Universe,


Harry
 Potter,
 what
 Netflix
 can
 do
 with


this


>> I
 never
 saw
 it.
 I
 think
 it's
 an
 amazing


um
 opportunity
 for
 this
 company
 to
 to


just
 take
 these
 franchises
 into
 a
 whole


another
 stratosphere.
 So,
 I'm
 excited


about
 the
 deal
 and
 I'm
 I'm
 happy.
 What


do
 you
 make
 of
 Josh's
 move
 to
 sell
 85%


of
 his
 his
 stock?


>> I
 think
 it's
 a
 mistake.
 I
 think
 I
 would


be
 more
 of
 a
 buyer
 of
 the
 stock.
 If
 the


deal
 does
 get
 blown
 up,
 the
 stock
 will


go
 higher.
 And
 plus,
 the
 one
 difference


between
 Josh
 and
 I
 is
 I
 can
 write


covered
 calls
 against
 this.
 There's


going
 to
 be
 heightened
 volatility
 now


around
 this
 name
 even
 more
 so
 they
 were


bowing
 out
 in
 in
 such
 a
 large
 way.
 He


would
 agree
 with
 everything
 that
 you've


said,
 I'm
 sure,
 on
 the
 fundamental
 basis


of
 this.
 Yeah.
 um
 the
 stock
 itself
 he


obviously
 the
 company
 itself
 the


leadership
 likes
 all
 of
 it
 but
 you're


gonna
 be
 in
 some
 level
 as
 in
 in


>> I
 wouldn't
 trim
 85%
 of
 it
 I
 think
 that's


I
 mean
 if
 it's
 a
 portfolio
 management


move
 that's
 different
 but
 like


I
 don't
 know
 that's
 a
 lot
 of
 Netflix


position
 you're
 getting
 out
 of
 for


something
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 much
 more


accretive
 than
 not
 even
 if
 there's
 going


to
 be
 some
 controversy
 around
 if
 they


can
 get
 the
 deal
 done
 in
 Washington


apparently
 Paramount
 is
 reportedly


considering
 presenting
 an
 offer
 for


Warner
 Brothers
 directly
 to
 shareholders


now
 this
 stuff
 can
 happen.
 Uh
 companies


can


go
 directly
 to
 the
 shareholder
 base
 and


just
 say
 hey
 we
 are
 willing
 to
 pay
 95


billion
 for
 uh
 Warner
 Brothers
 instead


of
 uh
 Netflix's
 80
 billion
 and
 you
 know


they
 can
 just
 bypass
 the
 company
 and


then
 the
 company
 then
 has
 a
 fiduciary


you
 know
 who
 did
 this
 in
 modern
 history


Mr.
 Elon
 Musk
 when
 he
 put
 out
 his
 offer


for
 X
 um
 he
 publicly
 said
 I
 want
 to
 buy


and
 then
 the
 the
 CEO
 had
 a
 fiduciary


responsibility
 to
 then
 inquire
 about
 the


offer
 because
 if
 that
 offer
 is
 better


than
 an
 existing
 offer
 you
 can't
 ignore


it
 as
 a
 fiduciary
 you
 have
 to
 take
 a


look
 at
 it.
 So
 that
 is
 kind
 of
 crazy
 if


Paramount
 wants
 it
 that
 bad
 that
 they're


just
 going
 to
 put
 out
 a
 press
 release


and
 says
 we'll
 pay
 a hundred
 billion
 or


something
 crazy
 and
 then
 Warner
 Brothers


can't
 actually
 just
 dismiss
 it.
 Warren


Brothers
 2608
 up
 about
 7%
 on
 the
 day.


And
 so
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 we're
 going
 to


see
 how
 that
 one
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.


That
 does
 seem
 desperate
 for
 Paramount.


Yes,
 I
 agree.


It
 seems
 like
 they
 really
 uh
 you
 know


really
 want
 it.
 But
 it's
 also
 just
 like


do
 they
 want
 it
 because
 it's
 going
 to


help
 their
 business
 or
 do
 they
 want
 it


for
 something
 else?
 Because
 Netflix
 is


obviously
 going
 to
 help
 their
 business.


For
 Warner
 Brothers,
 I'm
 not
 sure


exactly.
 For
 Paramount,
 I'm
 not
 sure


exactly
 how
 that's
 going
 to
 meaningfully


make
 a
 difference.
 Uh,
 I
 put
 a
 poll
 in


the
 chat
 on
 SoFi.
 Which
 one
 do
 you
 guys


think
 is
 going
 to
 get
 in?
 The
 other


companies
 that
 have
 a
 chance
 to
 get
 in,


by
 the
 way,
 are,
 let
 me
 pull
 this
 up


right
 here.
 Alab,
 Reddit,
 LG,
 Shener


Energy,
 VRT,
 Viva,
 Carvana,
 Haiko,
 Aries


Management,
 Kong,
 Micro
 Strategy,
 Toast,


and
 then
 SoFi.
 So,
 these
 are
 the
 names.


There
 could
 obviously
 be
 some
 outliers


here.
 Mic
 Strategy
 could
 be
 another
 one


that
 gets
 in.
 5:15
 p.m.
 Eastern
 is
 when


we'll
 get
 the
 announcement,


but
 these
 are
 all
 the
 names
 that
 have
 a


shot


of
 potentially
 getting
 in.
 Uh
 57%
 say


no.
 So
 does
 not
 get
 in
 to
 the
 S&P
 500


right
 here.
 Dude,
 I
 kind
 of
 think


there's
 a
 world
 Reddit
 get.
 really
 do


think
 Reddit
 I
 mean
 I
 if
 I
 had
 to
 bet


I'd
 probably
 say
 no
 because
 it's
 only
 a


year
 old
 but
 out
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 these


companies
 they
 are
 putting
 up
 some


really
 good
 metrics
 that
 the
 I
 mean
 the


S&P
 500
 ultimately
 wants
 the
 S&P
 to


grow.
 The
 S&P
 to
 grow
 you
 need
 companies


in
 it
 that
 are
 growing
 and
 Reddit
 has


just
 done
 a
 phenomenal
 job
 of
 showing


the
 growth.
 It
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 that's


slowing
 down
 even
 if
 you
 think
 the


multiples
 is
 a
 bit
 expensive
 on
 it.
 So


would
 not
 surprise
 me
 if
 Reddit
 or
 even


Carvana
 gets
 in.
 I
 don't
 have
 the
 list


of
 companies
 that
 are
 being
 um


considered
 of
 being
 removed.
 However,


if
 we
 just
 look
 at
 the
 performance
 of


these
 companies
 um
 and
 go
 to
 the
 bottom,


you
 know,
 there's
 plenty
 of
 names
 that


probably
 could
 get
 hit.
 Chipotle,
 for


example,
 that
 could
 get
 out.
 Um


Ferve,
 I
 don't
 think
 Ferve
 is
 going to


get
 out,
 but
 these
 are
 the
 names
 that


are
 down,
 you
 know,
 down
 60%.
 Lulu
 down


50%.


Yeah,
 just
 plenty
 of
 plenty
 of
 names.


Constellation
 Brands,
 just
 tons
 and
 tons


of
 obviously
 like
 a
 Target's
 probably


not
 getting
 replaced
 or
 anything
 like


that.
 But
 there
 are
 names
 out
 there
 that


have
 just
 been
 horrible
 this
 year
 that


you
 have
 a
 shot
 to
 remove.
 Naz
 got


removed
 last
 time.
 So,
 it's
 not
 crazy
 to


imagine
 that
 that
 could
 that
 could


happen.
 Uh
 the
 professor,
 let's
 get
 his


thoughts
 on
 what
 he's
 thinking
 about


what's
 going
 on
 with
 the
 markets
 and
 the


Fed
 and
 then
 we
 will
 keep
 going
 from


there.


I'm
 actually
 fairly
 pleased
 with
 what


I'm
 seeing
 in
 terms
 of
 holiday
 sales.
 Uh


I
 was
 a
 little
 fearful
 that
 tariffs


might
 impact
 those
 sales,
 but
 Black


Friday
 was
 good.
 Cyber
 Monday
 was
 fairly


good.
 Not
 gang
 busters,
 but
 it
 shows
 an


economy
 that,
 you
 know,
 is
 is
 moving
 at


a,
 you
 know,
 probably
 two
 two
 and
 a


half%
 GDP
 pace.
 Um,
 one
 thing
 that's
 so


unusual,
 Scott,
 I
 mean,
 yesterday
 when
 I


saw
 jobless
 claims
 go
 to
 more
 than
 a


three-year
 low,
 uh,
 and
 and
 the
 day


before
 that
 on
 Wednesday,
 seeing
 the
 ADP


employment
 report
 showing
 the
 lowest


level
 in
 almost
 three
 years.
 I
 mean,


that
 is
 something
 that
 is
 just
 never


supposed
 to
 happen.
 Uh,
 I
 mean,
 the
 the


the
 labor
 market
 uh
 is
 is
 so
 hard
 to


interpret.
 This
 is
 the
 most
 extreme
 uh


no
 higher
 no
 fire
 economy
 uh
 that
 we've


ever
 seen.


>> It's
 funny,
 professor,
 you
 know,
 there


are
 some
 notes
 today
 that
 do
 talk
 about


seasonality
 being
 in
 in
 our
 favor
 um
 as


it
 as
 it
 tends
 to
 be,
 especially
 when


you
 come
 into
 December
 with
 such
 a


strong
 year
 leading
 into
 it.
 But
 there's


also
 a
 mention
 today
 of
 FOMO
 that
 it's


in
 full
 swing
 yet
 again.
 That
 there
 are


a
 lot
 of
 portfolio
 managers
 who
 have


underperformed
 this
 market.
 maybe
 they


couldn't
 be
 as
 large
 as
 they
 otherwise


would
 have
 wanted
 to
 in
 some
 of
 the
 mega


caps.
 So
 now
 the
 chase
 is
 on.
 Is
 there


something
 to
 that?


>> Well,
 there
 there
 is,
 but
 again,
 you


know,
 the
 Mag
 7
 has
 been
 the


outperformers
 and
 they've
 been


relatively
 weak
 actually
 over
 the
 last


uh
 four
 to
 six
 weeks,
 which
 is
 a
 little


bit
 surprising.
 Now,
 maybe
 some
 people


will
 say,
 I
 got
 to
 get
 them
 on
 my


balance
 sheet
 in
 the
 last
 couple
 of


weeks
 of
 the
 year.
 You
 do
 get
 some
 uh
 of


that
 evening
 up
 that's
 happening.
 Um,


but
 I'm
 actually
 rather
 pleased
 to


seeing
 uh
 the
 rally
 broaden
 out.
 Uh,
 and


right
 now
 I
 I
 actually
 see
 less
 FOMO


than
 I
 think
 I
 uh
 saw
 maybe
 four
 or
 six


weeks
 ago.


>> Oh,
 interesting.
 You
 know,
 the
 the
 other


idea
 is
 is
 what
 city
 puts
 forth
 today,


professor,
 where
 they
 say
 no
 pain,
 no


gain,
 and
 they
 use
 the
 A
 and
 the
 I
 in


pain
 and
 gain
 in
 in
 caps
 and
 talking


about
 a
 bubble.
 We
 we
 think
 we're
 in
 a


bubble
 in
 US
 equities,
 they
 say.
 But


bubbles
 are
 initially
 quite
 profitable,


so
 stay
 long.
 This
 is
 like,
 well,
 I


guess
 you
 have
 to
 inflate
 it
 before
 you


pop
 it,
 so
 we
 might
 as
 well
 ride
 this
 as


long
 as
 we
 can.


>> You
 know,
 the
 big
 So,
 just
 a
 minute.
 Is


this
 like
 96
 or
 99?
 There's
 a
 big


There's
 a
 big
 difference
 uh
 about
 that.


And
 by
 the
 way,
 that
 internet
 bubble
 was


many
 times
 what
 we're
 seeing
 now.


>> Service
 Now

 five
 for
 one
 stock


split.
 Service
 Now
 will
 be

their
 stock,
 $859
 stock.
 stocks
 up
 a


little
 bit
 after
 hours
 about
 half
 a


percent.
 Uh
 if
 it
 stays
 at
 this
 price,


it'll
 open
 at
 $171.
 I
 believe
 in
 two


weeks
 the
 split
 will
 be
 approved.
 Uh


honestly,
 it
 might
 happen
 closer
 earlier


than
 that,
 but
 officially
 the


shareholder
 vote
 has
 gone
 through.


Service
 Now
 shareholders
 have
 approved
 a


five
 for
 one
 stock
 split.


>> Uh
 uh
 you
 know,
 not
 in
 in
 both
 the
 tech


stocks
 and
 the
 non-
 tech
 stocks.
 I'm


actually
 pleased
 to
 see
 some
 caution
 in


the
 mag
 7
 uh
 recently
 and
 uh
 I'm
 not


saying
 you
 know
 I
 mean
 Tesla
 Palunteer


there's
 a
 few
 of
 them
 that
 do
 have
 those


tripledigit
 PE
 ratios
 but
 the
 others
 uh


you
 know
 PE
 ratios
 of
 of
 30
 when
 you're


growing
 20%
 plus
 a
 year
 and
 beating
 on


all
 metrics.
 I'm
 not
 saying
 they're
 the


ones
 to
 own,
 but
 certainly
 I
 wouldn't


say
 that
 they
 are
 in
 bubble
 territory.


And
 once
 you
 subtract
 the
 mag
 7
 or
 the


related
 tech,
 you
 get
 pees
 that
 are


under
 20,
 which
 in
 my
 uh
 you
 know,


playbook
 is
 absolutely
 not
 a
 bubble.
 So


I
 I
 am
 not
 in
 agreement
 with
 uh
 you


know,
 Cityroup's
 analysis
 here.
 you


know,
 when
 you
 when
 you
 talk
 about


certain
 kinds
 of
 stocks
 and
 and
 you


mentioned
 Palunteer
 by
 name.
 I'm


wondering
 given
 the
 number
 of
 markets


you've
 seen
 over
 the
 years,
 you've
 seen


many
 stocks
 that
 have
 acted
 like
 this


one
 over
 the
 years.
 How
 do
 you
 tell
 an


investor
 class,
 so
 to
 speak,
 as
 the


professor,
 how
 to
 judge
 a
 company
 like


that?
 It's
 a
 totally
 legit,
 real,
 great


business,
 right?
 with
 a
 with
 a
 fire


brand
 CEO
 who
 doesn't
 take
 any
 you
 know


what


>> and
 and
 this
 company's
 got
 some
 real


stuff
 going
 on.
 Yes,
 it
 trades
 at
 a
 high


P,
 but
 it
 also
 has
 a
 a
 very
 loyal
 cohort


of
 investors
 behind
 it,
 not
 only


institutionally
 but
 retail.
 Well,
 Scott,


everything
 you're
 saying
 right
 now
 could


be
 said
 of
 Tesla,
 right?
 Um
 I
 mean
 you


know
 a
 very
 you
 know
 CEO
 that's
 in
 the


limelight
 uh
 who's
 done
 amazing
 things


PE
 ratio
 well
 over
 a
 hundred.
 We
 know
 if


it
 is
 just
 on
 the
 if
 Tesla
 was
 just
 a


car
 company
 you
 know
 it
 would
 be
 selling


at
 about
 30
 or
 $40
 a
 share.
 It's
 all


those
 options
 on
 what
 Elon
 Musk
 can
 do


might
 do.
 Uh
 of
 course
 that's
 a
 $64


question.
 uh
 all
 the
 things
 that
 Karp


can
 do,
 might
 do.
 Uh
 but
 these
 both
 of


these
 companies,
 Palunteer
 a
 and
 and


Tesla
 show
 so
 much
 more
 substance
 than


the
 crazy
 internet
 companies
 that
 were


being
 bought
 in
 2000.


>> I
 guess
 that's
 that's
 kind
 of
 my
 point,


right?
 is
 you
 have
 to
 make
 a


distinction.
 Even
 while
 we
 make


analogies
 to
 different
 periods
 of
 time


and
 market
 caps
 and
 valuations
 etc.


there
 are
 clear
 differences
 that
 that


need
 to
 be
 pointed
 out.
 Let
 me
 ask
 you


this.
 Um
 the
 backup
 in
 interest
 rates


concerning
 to
 you
 in
 any
 way?


>> Uh
 yeah.
 Well,
 you
 know,
 we're
 going
 to


see
 the
 Fed
 uh
 next
 week.
 Um,
 you
 know,


I've
 always
 said
 that
 even
 if
 the
 Fed


lowers,
 I
 don't
 I
 actually
 see
 the
 the


tenure
 between
 four
 and
 four
 and
 a


quarter.
 Uh,
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 you


have
 to
 lower
 the
 short
 end
 because
 the


short
 end
 is
 usually
 one
 percentage


point
 below
 the
 long
 end
 and
 that's
 why


it
 belows
 belongs
 on
 the
 low
 3s.
 We'll


see
 how
 the
 bond
 market
 reacts.
 What's


causing
 some
 of
 this
 backup
 today?
 It's


it's
 it's
 it's
 hard
 to
 say.
 Are
 are
 they


worried
 about
 Kevin
 Hasset?
 That
 he


might,
 you
 know,
 cowtow
 to
 Trump
 a


little
 bit
 too
 much,
 lower
 interest


rates
 a
 little
 too
 fast,
 a
 little
 too


much.
 It
 could
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 uh,


you
 know,
 the
 the
 oil
 market
 has
 ticked


up
 a
 bit.
 Uh,
 I
 wouldn't
 call,
 you
 know,


411
 to
 be
 something
 to
 be
 concerned


about.
 Uh,
 certainly
 quite
 yet.


>> I'll
 ask
 you
 this
 then
 about
 the
 Feds


since
 you
 bring
 it
 up.
 I
 I
 think
 people


think
 they're
 going
 to
 cut
 next
 week.


Yeah.
 Oh,
 I
 think
 it's


>> Yeah,


>> you
 absolutely
 you
 say


>> I
 Well,
 nothing
 is
 absolute.
 I
 I
 think


it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 very
 hawkish
 cut,


which
 means
 they're
 going
 to
 cut,
 but


put
 in
 the
 language
 that
 they're
 apt
 to


hold
 in
 January
 unless
 they
 see
 the


economy,
 you
 know,
 significantly


deteriorate
 or
 inflation
 come
 down


dramatically.
 So
 that
 that
 is
 what
 I


think
 the
 the
 message
 is
 going
 to
 be


next
 week.


>> I
 wonder
 if
 you're
 getting
 into


>> All right.
 So
 that's
 what
 you
 got
 from


the
 professor
 again.
 The
 probabilities


for
 that
 um
 December
 rate
 cut
 is
 going


to
 be
 now
 87%.
 Next
 Wednesday
 I'll
 be


live
 and
 we'll
 see
 if
 that
 plays
 out.


You
 got
 the
 Mexico
 president
 that
 just


tweeted.
 There
 she
 is
 with
 Carney
 from


Canada
 and
 Trump
 in
 Washington.
 We
 had


an
 excellent
 meeting
 with
 President
 of


the
 United
 States
 Donald
 Trump
 and
 with


the
 prime
 minister
 of
 Canada
 Mark


Carney.
 We
 talked
 about
 the
 great


opportunity
 that
 the
 2026
 FIFA
 World
 Cup


represents
 for
 the
 three
 countries
 and


have
 the
 good
 relationship
 we
 have.
 We


agreed
 to
 continue
 working
 together
 on


trade
 issues
 with
 our
 teams.


Okay.
 So,


um


they
 are
 continuing
 to
 talk
 and
 work


their
 stuff
 out.
 Back
 in
 March,
 I


remember
 Mexico
 and
 the
 United
 States


were
 a
 bit
 more
 hostile
 with
 each
 other


when
 it
 came
 to
 trade
 relations,
 but


maybe
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 as
 ugly
 as
 it


was
 back
 then.
 Uh,
 in
 about
 1
 hour,
 less


than
 an
 hour
 now,
 we
 will
 know
 who
 gets


into
 the
 S&P
 500
 and
 who
 gets
 out.
 So,


it'll
 take
 until
 about
 5:15.
 Again,
 this


is
 the
 list
 for
 the
 companies
 that
 could


get
 in.
 Carvana,
 Micro
 Strategy,
 Kong,


Aries,
 Reddit,
 Shener.
 Shaneer
 is


actually
 I
 mean
 if
 I
 had
 to
 guess
 one
 I


think
 Shener
 like
 that
 that
 they've
 been


a
 company
 been
 public
 for
 a
 long
 time.


Oil
 and
 gas
 is
 something
 the
 S&P
 500


loves.
 The
 S&P
 500
 also
 does
 have
 a
 lot


of
 financials
 which
 is
 another
 bare
 case


for
 potentially
 Sofi
 or
 Toast
 getting


in.
 But
 then
 again
 those
 companies
 might


be
 of
 higher
 quality
 than
 the
 other


ones.
 Then
 you
 obviously
 have
 Reddit


that
 could


be
 one
 that
 gets
 in.
 A
 firm
 isn't
 on


this
 list
 but
 yes
 a
 firm
 could
 get
 in.
 A


firm
 also
 went
 public
 five
 years
 ago.


So,
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 crazy
 to
 imagine
 that


a
 firm
 has
 a
 shot
 of
 potentially
 getting


in.
 SoFi
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 after
 hours


04%.
 Reddit's
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 And
 then


Service
 Now
 with
 that
 stock
 split
 is


also
 up.
 That
 Reddit
 headline
 or
 not
 the


Red
 headline,
 the
 Warner
 Brothers


headline,
 I'm
 reading
 more
 from
 it
 right


here.
 Paramount
 is
 considering
 going


hostile
 after
 losing
 Warner
 Brothers


Netflix
 bid.
 Uh,
 apparently
 Larry


Ellison
 offered
 $30
 a
 share
 in
 all
 cash


and
 that
 was
 rejected.


which
 feels
 a
 little
 bit
 better
 than


Netflix's
 offer.
 To
 be
 honest,
 it
 just


seems
 like
 Warner
 Brothers
 didn't
 want


to
 take
 that
 offer.


Tanner
 says
 toast
 is
 not
 eligible.


Morgan
 Stanley
 just
 wrote,
 but
 okay,
 so


then
 Toast
 might
 not
 have
 a
 shot
 to
 get


in.
 Um,
 you
 know
 what
 could
 be
 happening


here
 as
 well?
 Maybe
 Warner
 Brothers
 knew


that
 they
 would
 piss
 off
 Paramount
 and


Larry
 Ellson
 by
 going
 with
 Netflix
 and


maybe
 they
 wanted
 this
 to
 happen.
 like


they
 wanted
 because
 essentially
 this


could
 create
 a
 bidding
 board
 because
 if


Warner
 Brothers
 comes
 back
 and
 says,


"Hey,
 we're
 gonna
 pay
 95
 billion."


I
 mean,
 what
 happens
 if
 Netflix
 comes


out
 and
 says,
 "Okay,
 we
 pay
 more
 as


well."
 Even
 though
 I
 think
 at
 that
 point


you
 kind
 of
 just
 let
 it
 go.


But
 I
 mean,
 it
 would
 be
 quite
 incredible


if
 that's
 what
 happens
 for,
 you
 know,


Warner
 Brothers
 has
 has
 some
 rich


assets,
 but
 dude,
 this
 stock
 was
 at
 11


12
 bucks
 for
 the
 majority
 of
 the
 past


couple
 years.
 The
 fact
 that
 it's
 one
 of


the
 top
 performing
 S&P
 500
 stocks


towards
 the
 end
 of the
 year
 is
 just


incredible


and
 it
 goes
 to
 show
 what
 could
 happen


when
 you
 have
 valuable
 IP
 that
 the


street
 wants.
 Let's
 get
 a
 little
 bit


more
 coverage
 on
 this
 Netflix
 deal


and
 see
 how
 this
 one
 might
 end
 up


playing
 out.


>> Swipe
 at
 Netflix
 just
 living
 rentree
 in


my
 head
 today.


>> Yeah,
 that
 was
 quite
 a
 long
 time
 ago.


And
 now
 Netflix
 is
 such
 a
 streaming


giant
 that
 it
 makes
 sense
 for
 it
 to


acquire
 um
 Warner
 Brothers
 if
 you
 look


from
 their
 point
 of
 view.
 Now
 just


looking
 at
 their
 argument
 about
 why


Netflix
 believes
 that
 this
 deal
 should


go
 through
 they're
 saying
 they
 just
 have


8%
 of
 monthly
 viewing
 share.
 If
 you


consider
 viewing
 across
 both
 streaming


and
 linear
 YouTube
 in
 the
 number
 one


spot,
 then
 Disney
 and
 they're
 saying


even
 if
 they
 acquire
 these
 Warner


Brothers
 assets
 with
 HBO,
 their
 share
 of


total
 viewing
 will
 not
 be
 meaningful


enough
 to
 raise
 concerns
 from


regulators.
 Having
 said
 that,
 we're


seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 concern
 today,
 John,
 um


from
 the
 Screen
 Actors
 Guild
 as
 well
 as


from
 the
 WGA.
 The
 WGA
 calling
 for
 this


deal
 to
 be
 blocked.
 The
 Screen
 Actors


Guild
 just
 issuing
 a
 statement
 saying,


"This
 transaction
 may
 serve
 the


financial
 interests
 of
 shareholders,
 but


it
 raises
 many
 serious
 questions
 about


its
 impact
 on
 the
 future
 of
 the


entertainment
 industry,
 especially
 the


human
 creative
 talent
 whose
 livelihoods


and
 careers
 depend
 on
 it."
 So,
 John,
 I


think
 we're
 going to
 hear
 a
 lot
 of


questions
 here
 about
 how
 to
 calculate


the
 impact
 of
 this
 merger.
 Um,
 there
 are


some
 other
 calculations
 of
 the
 streaming


heft
 of
 Netflix
 sensor
 tower
 out
 with


some
 data
 today
 showing
 that
 if
 you
 look


just
 at
 mobile
 viewing
 and
 you
 look
 at


the
 fact
 that
 Netflix
 is
 such
 a
 leader


in
 terms
 of
 mobile
 viewing,
 they're


going
 to
 actually
 have
 56%


in
 terms
 of
 monthly
 active
 users
 of
 the


mobile
 app.
 Right
 now,
 Netflix,
 they


say,
 has
 46%.
 Amazon
 Prime
 Video
 has


17%.
 But
 that's
 just
 of
 mobile
 viewing.


And
 I
 I
 suspect
 that
 Netflix
 and
 their


confidence
 that
 this
 deal
 is
 going
 to
 go


through
 is
 expecting
 that
 the
 strength


of
 YouTube
 and
 also
 the
 viewing
 on


social
 media
 platforms
 like
 Tik
 Tok
 is


going
 to
 enable
 them
 to
 say
 that
 they


don't
 dominate.
 They're
 just
 one
 player


in
 this
 ecosystem.


>> But
 do
 they
 become
 uh
 an
 Apple
 type


player
 now
 across
 not
 just
 streaming
 but


also
 theaters
 and
 TV?
 And
 I
 say
 that


because
 uh
 Netflix
 now
 becomes
 an


important
 player
 in
 theaters,
 assuming


they
 don't
 drop
 those
 WBD
 assets.
 And


part
 of
 what's
 come
 under
 fire
 from
 the


industry
 a
 bit
 is
 these
 algorithmic


decisions
 that
 are
 getting
 made
 on
 what


flies
 or
 what
 doesn't
 based
 on
 the


numbers
 in
 streaming.
 One
 can
 imagine


that's
 starting
 to
 influence
 what
 movies


get
 green
 lit,
 uh
 who
 gets
 to
 act
 in


certain
 TV
 shows,
 even
 if
 it's
 not


primarily
 for
 streaming.


Well,
 look,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 the
 data


always
 comes
 into
 play,
 but
 there
 are
 a


lot
 of
 different
 questions
 in
 there,


John.
 And
 one
 of
 them
 is
 whether
 they


become
 an
 Apple-like
 player.
 I
 actually


think
 the
 question
 is
 whether
 they


become
 an
 Amazon-like
 player
 where


they're
 selling
 Netflix
 and
 then


allowing
 users
 to
 bundle
 in
 the
 HBO


content
 or
 are
 they
 going
 to
 include
 the


HBO
 content
 in
 the
 Netflix
 subscription


price
 and
 bump
 up
 the
 price
 of
 that?
 So,


the
 question
 then
 is,
 do
 they
 then
 add


other
 channels?
 Are
 they
 going
 to
 allow


consumers
 to
 subscribe
 to
 Netflix
 plus
 a


series
 of
 channels
 including
 HBO,
 which


is
 what
 Amazon
 has
 in
 its
 channels


business?
 So,
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 key


question
 to
 be
 determined
 for
 how


Netflix
 approaches
 its
 new
 um
 its
 new


portfolio
 of
 offerings
 between
 Netflix,


HBO,
 and
 then
 what
 other
 other
 streaming


services
 that
 it
 doesn't
 own
 it
 decides


to
 bundle
 in
 there
 as
 well.
 I


>> I
 think
 the
 argument
 as
 well
 that


Netflix
 is
 going
 to
 go
 to
 the
 regulators


with
 and
 say,
 "Hey,
 we
 are
 not
 a


monopoly
 because
 we're
 competing
 with
 um


with
 with
 YouTube
 is
 like
 a
 legit


argument.
 If
 they
 were
 to
 acquire
 Warner


Brothers,
 would
 they
 be
 in
 monopoly
 in


like
 streaming?"
 Yes.
 But
 they
 do
 not


have
 a
 monopoly
 on
 attention.
 And
 I


think
 in
 the
 attention
 economy
 that


we're
 in,
 like
 Tik
 Tok,
 YouTube,
 I
 mean,


so
 many
 Instagram
 reels,
 so
 many


platforms


obviously
 take
 away
 time
 from
 from
 from


long
 form
 media.
 It's
 just
 it's
 become


it's
 become
 inevitable
 that
 these
 are


these
 are
 competitors
 to
 each
 other,


even
 if
 they're
 not
 direct
 competitors.


So
 now,
 is
 that
 the
 best
 argument
 in


court?
 It's
 a
 reasonable
 argument
 to
 say


that
 you
 can't
 say
 we're
 a
 monopoly
 if


like
 YouTube
 has
 more
 streaming
 time


than
 us.
 But
 is
 it
 the
 one
 that
 the


judges
 would
 be
 willing
 to
 accept?
 I'm


not
 sure
 right
 now
 that
 the
 DOJ's
 taken


this
 up.
 We're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 ends
 up


happening
 right
 here.
 Warner
 Brothers


down
 a
 little
 bit
 after
 hours.
 SoFi
 up
 a


little
 bit.
 S&P
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 as
 well.


We
 will
 see.


We
 will
 see
 in
 30
 minutes
 if
 that
 ends


up
 playing
 out.
 Reddit
 deep
 dive
 has
 not


gone
 live
 yet.
 Still
 working
 on
 that


one.
 Should
 be
 out
 early
 next
 week.
 Um,


you
 know,
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 I
 also


don't
 want
 to
 post
 it
 yet
 is
 because
 if


they
 get
 into
 the
 S&P,
 that
 changes.
 I


mean,
 if
 if
 Rena
 gets
 into
 the
 S&P,
 it's


already
 high
 beta.
 This
 thing's,
 in
 my


opinion,
 probably
 up
 another
 10%.
 If
 not


more.
 So,
 valuation
 part
 of
 the
 deep


dive
 is
 going
 to
 have
 to
 take
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 change
 if
 that
 happens.
 Um,


again,
 S&P
 is
 a
 big
 deal.
 every
 two


weeks,
 retirement
 accounts,
 401ks
 across


the
 country
 have
 to
 buy
 a
 little
 piece


of
 all
 these
 different
 stocks.
 So,
 it


definitely
 has
 a
 massive,
 massive
 impact


if
 they
 can
 end
 up
 uh
 if
 they
 can
 end
 up


getting
 it.


How
 much
 would
 Micro
 Strategy
 go?
 You


know,
 it's
 interesting
 because
 MSTR
 at


it's
 actually
 a
 good
 question.
 I
 haven't


thought
 about
 it
 too
 much
 because
 they


trade
 at
 a
 at
 a
 at
 a
 premium
 to
 Bitcoin.


So,
 if
 they
 get
 into
 the
 S&P,
 there's


just
 direct
 pressure
 on
 buying
 the


shares,
 but


does
 that
 matter


if
 like
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 if


Bitcoin
 were
 to
 go
 down
 5%,
 like
 would


that
 premium
 even
 withhold
 itself?
 And
 I


think
 that's
 what
 the
 committee
 is


worried
 about
 on
 the
 S&P
 like
 they're


worried
 that
 if
 we
 let
 MSTR
 in
 the
 the


natural
 premium
 or
 the
 types
 of
 premium


it
 could
 trade
 at
 is
 always
 affected
 by


this
 underlying
 asset.


And
 you
 know,
 it's
 almost
 like
 you
 need


a
 you
 need
 a
 Bitcoin
 maxi
 on
 the


committee
 to
 like
 be
 bullish
 enough
 to


to
 pitch
 MSTR.


But
 yeah,
 I
 would
 not
 bet
 on
 those
 guys.


Those
 guys
 getting
 in
 MSTR
 right
 there


178
 99
 after
 hours.
 Nebas
 right
 here.


That
 one's
 also
 flat.
 New
 bank
 up
 a


little
 bit.
 Robbing
 it
 up
 a
 little
 bit.


Grab
 down
 about
 2
 cents
 after
 hours.
 I


don't
 see
 any
 news
 on
 Grab.
 They
 did


have
 a
 lot
 of
 volume
 today
 though.
 41


million
 shares.
 So,
 the
 volume
 has


ramped
 up.
 Stock
 price
 not
 going
 up.


Volume
 ramping
 up
 again
 tends
 to
 tell
 me


that
 there's
 something
 going
 on
 behind


the
 scenes.
 I
 can't
 prove
 it.
 I
 don't


know.
 We
 saw
 a
 lot
 of
 darkpool
 orders


last
 week
 of
 close
 to
 $500
 million
 in


single
 transaction.
 So,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


this
 comes
 down
 to
 what
 happens
 with


GOTU
 and
 I
 think
 we
 get
 more
 clarity
 on


that
 going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 December
 when


Goto
 has
 their
 shareholder
 meeting.


Marll
 right
 there,
 98.91.
 That
 one


didn't
 get
 the
 $100
 close
 for
 the
 week,


although
 it
 did
 jump
 about
 7%.
 and


Dolingo
 1997.
 Also


not
 a
 not
 a
 bad
 day
 for
 Duolingo


because
 that
 was
 also
 great.


Um,
 if
 Netflix
 gets


Warner
 Brothers,


does
 that
 mean
 Harry
 P?
 Yes.
 I
 mean,


Harry
 Potter,
 which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 core


assets
 of
 Warner
 Brothers,
 will
 go
 over


to
 Netflix.


Dude,
 like
 that
 alone,
 the
 amount
 of


people
 that
 just
 watch
 Harry
 Potter


movies
 over
 like
 Chris
 says
 his
 wife
 is


like
 obsessed
 with
 Harry.
 Like
 he's
 had


to
 seen
 these
 movies
 millions
 of
 times


because
 just
 always
 on
 in
 the


background.
 My
 cousin,
 she
 loves
 Harry


Potter
 as
 well.
 There's
 just
 so
 much
 IP


attached
 to
 that
 franchise.
 Once
 you


have
 a
 good
 piece
 of
 content
 that


becomes
 timeless,


it's
 one
 of
 those
 things
 that's
 a
 money


printer
 forever
 because
 it
 can
 be


consumed


forever,
 right?
 There's
 a
 infinite
 tam


on
 the
 amount
 of
 times
 it
 can
 actually


be
 watched
 and
 then
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that


it
 can
 be
 licensed
 many
 many
 times.


Yes,
 Michelle
 also


obsessed
 with
 Harry
 Potter.
 I
 mean
 I
 saw


the
 Chamber
 of
 Secrets
 over


Thanksgiving.
 Dude,
 it
 was
 like
 so
 we
 we


it
 was
 like
 2
 a.m.
 So
 we
 fell
 asleep


when
 with
 like
 40
 minutes
 left.
 I
 woke


up
 the
 next
 morning.
 I
 was
 like
 bro
 I


got
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 is
 in
 this


Chamber
 of
 Secrets.
 I
 have
 to
 open
 that


[ __ ]
 Like
 and
 I'm
 I'm
 usually
 not
 like


that.
 if
 I
 barely,
 you
 know,
 finish
 a


movie
 or
 something,
 like
 whatever.
 Like,


I
 don't
 really
 care.
 There's
 so
 many


movies
 I've
 just
 never
 finished
 the
 last


like
 20.
 I
 woke
 up,
 I
 was
 like,
 I
 need


to
 see
 what's
 in
 this
 damn
 chamber.
 I
 am


curious.


And
 so
 those
 Harry
 Potter
 movies
 will


uh
 absolutely
 get
 you.


Prime
 has
 200
 million
 subs
 and
 Disney


has
 130
 million.
 That's
 on
 top
 of
 IGX,


YouTube,
 No
 Monopoly,
 Shake
 the
 Fear


Off.
 You
 know,
 so
 many
 times
 I
 forget


about
 Amazon
 Prime
 as
 a
 video
 streaming


platform.
 Like
 I
 just
 forget
 to
 mention


it
 so
 many
 times.
 But
 yes,
 that
 is
 also


a
 big
 competitor
 in
 the
 streaming
 space.


Wow,
 we
 got
 a
 meta
 headline.
 Is
 this


legit?


Is
 Meta
 moving
 on
 this
 or


this
 was
 posted
 20
 minutes
 ago?
 Um,


okay.
 I'll
 confirm
 this,
 but
 Meta


acquired


Limitless,
 which
 is
 an
 AI
 wearables


startup.


Limitless
 is
 the
 maker
 of
 the
 pendant


that
 records
 conversations
 and
 generates


summaries.
 Zuck
 says
 it
 accelerates


Meta's
 push
 into
 AI
 enabled
 wearables


after
 the
 Ray-B
 band
 smart
 glasses


surprise
 hit.


If
 they're
 using
 a
 Zuck
 quote.
 Oh,
 yeah.


Boom.
 Well,
 actually,
 this
 came
 out
 two


hours
 ago.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay,
 so
 this


might
 be
 priced
 in.


My
 bad.
 Yeah,
 that's
 old
 news,
 but
 this


is
 still
 really
 important.
 Wow.
 So,
 Meta


is
 buying
 an
 AI
 wearable
 company.


Limitless
 makes
 small
 AI
 powered
 pendant


that
 can
 record
 conversations.
 We're


excited
 that
 Limitless
 will
 be
 joining


Meta
 to
 accelerate
 our
 work.
 Meta


recently
 announced
 a
 new
 vision
 to
 bring


personal
 super
 intelligence
 to
 everyone,


and
 a
 key
 part
 of
 that
 vision
 is


incredible
 AI
 enabled
 wearables.


I
 don't
 know,
 guys.
 I
 really
 I
 really
 am


not
 bullish
 on
 these
 wearables.
 I'm


really
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 people
 are
 going


to
 want
 to
 put
 something
 on
 that,
 you


know.
 By
 the
 way,
 we
 we
 know
 Chacha
 is


working
 on
 the
 exact
 same
 thing.
 Like


every
 time
 Sam
 teases
 this
 um


collaboration
 with
 Johnny
 Ies
 on
 on
 on
 a


wearable
 for
 AI,
 it
 has
 to
 be
 some
 type


of
 necklace
 or
 bracelet
 or
 something


that's
 recording
 what
 you're
 saying,


then
 talking
 to
 you.
 So,
 it's


summarizing
 using
 GPT.
 In
 this
 case,


Zucks
 would
 be
 using
 llama


and
 then
 that's
 how
 you're
 engaging
 with


it.


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a
 thing.
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 I
 really
 don't


and
 you
 know
 for
 the
 people
 like
 ohit


you
 just
 don't
 understand
 technology.


You're
 being
 you
 know
 uh
 count
 you're


acting
 like
 the
 person
 who
 said


Blackberry
 was
 going
 to
 survive
 forever.


I
 yes
 maybe
 there's
 some
 hint
 of
 that


but
 at
 its
 core
 ask
 yourself
 would
 you


wear
 this?
 Like
 just
 like
 just
 be
 honest


with
 yourself.
 Would
 you
 wear
 something


around
 your
 neck
 all
 day
 that's


recording
 everything
 that
 you're
 talking


to?
 Like,
 no,
 you
 just
 do
 it
 with
 your


phone
 or
 with
 your
 AirPods
 connected
 to


your
 phone.
 Like,
 I
 feel
 like
 the
 use


case
 is
 real,
 but
 the
 use
 case
 in
 a
 new


form
 factor
 is
 non-existent.
 And
 and


that's
 why
 we
 saw
 the
 Vision
 Pro
 didn't


work.


People
 just
 wouldn't
 care
 about
 that.


And
 also,
 like,
 let's
 also
 not


disrespect
 Steve
 Jobs.
 the
 iPhone
 and


the
 the
 touchscreen
 with
 Apple
 iOS.
 That


was
 a
 new
 paradigm
 shift.
 Wearing
 a


necklace
 that
 has
 a
 pendant
 that
 records


your
 convers
 is
 not
 a
 paradigmatic
 shift


on
 how
 we
 think
 about
 computing.
 It's


just
 like
 maybe
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of
 an


efficient
 mouse
 trap
 on
 on
 a
 use
 case.


But
 to
 go
 from
 keyboards
 to
 touchcreens


and
 then
 to
 open
 up
 the
 app
 store
 in


2008,
 which
 what
 like
 really
 made
 the


touchcreen
 valuable
 because
 you
 had
 so


many
 different
 products
 on
 top
 of
 it.


That's
 what
 changed
 everything


which
 I
 don't
 think
 Meta
 is
 necessarily


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do.


You
 said
 the
 same
 thing
 about
 Ray-B


bands.
 Have
 I
 been
 wrong?


Like
 Ray-B
 bands
 don't
 like
 that
 is
 not


a
 meaningful
 revenue
 contributor
 for


Meta.
 I
 mean,
 yeah,
 people
 wear
 them,


but
 like
 it's
 like
 we're
 not
 talking


about
 billions
 of
 Ray-B
 bands
 that
 get


sold.
 We're
 definitely
 not
 talking
 about


them
 being
 used
 as
 a
 computing
 platform


on
 a
 daily
 basis.
 People
 wear
 them.
 Yes.


But
 it's
 not
 like
 replacing
 the
 iPhone,


at least
 not
 in
 my
 opinion.


Um,


Zucks
 is
 too
 rich
 and
 too
 bored.
 That


could
 also
 be


that
 could
 also
 be
 what
 Zucks
 is
 dealing


with
 right
 now.
 But
 no,
 I
 think
 he's


just
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 where
 the


metaverse
 spend
 goes.
 Then


that
 might
 end
 just
 up
 being
 for
 the


wearables
 part.


Why
 would
 you
 need
 RayBands
 independent?


That's
 a
 good
 question.
 Why
 would
 you?


I
 mean,


I
 just
 think
 you're
 going
 to
 need
 the


phone.
 They
 also
 acquired
 that
 company


where
 you
 have
 that
 uh
 the
 wristwatch


thing
 that
 like
 allows
 you
 to
 like
 type


because
 the
 ri
 like
 type
 in
 the
 air
 and


it's
 like
 sensing
 what
 your
 fingers
 are


doing.
 Again,
 I
 just
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 that


stuff
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 how
 humans


interact
 with
 these
 devices.


All
 these
 internet
 revolutions
 and
 tech


revolutions
 that
 happen,
 they
 all
 have
 a


lot
 of
 ideas
 and
 there's
 like
 a
 couple


of
 them
 that
 end
 up
 becoming
 the


mainstream
 ones.
 And
 I
 think
 right
 now


one
 of
 the
 ideas
 is
 there
 is
 a
 way
 to


replace
 computing
 at
 the
 edge
 with
 these


devices
 uh
 that
 are
 different
 from
 the


iPhone.
 And
 I
 guess
 my
 contrarian
 take,


which
 I
 don't
 even
 think
 is
 that


contrarian,
 is
 that
 people
 will
 just
 use


the
 iPhone
 or
 their
 Pixel
 or
 whatever


for
 those
 use
 cases.


Yeah,
 that's
 a
 good
 point.
 Doug
 says,


"No
 company's
 going to
 allow
 these
 to
 be


worn
 at
 work."


Dude,
 imagine
 wearing
 something
 walking


through
 the
 office
 that's
 just
 recording


everything
 everyone
 is
 saying,
 or
 having


glasses
 that's
 recording
 everything


everyone
 is
 doing.
 Like,
 that's
 it's


weird,
 bro.
 And
 then
 do
 you
 want
 to
 come


to
 the
 office
 if
 you
 know
 some
 guys


walking
 around
 constantly
 like
 recording


every
 like
 that's
 just
 awkward.


There's
 definitely
 those
 privacy


concerns
 that
 that
 would
 come
 up.


Service
 Now
 still
 moving
 a
 little
 bit


after
 hours
 on
 that
 five
 for
 one
 split.


See
 now
 what
 Elon's
 doing
 is
 totally


different.
 You
 put
 a
 chip
 in
 someone's


brain,
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 wear
 anything.


And
 that
 actually
 has
 like
 far


substantial
 use
 cases
 with
 the
 early


success
 Neuralink
 has
 had
 versus
 like


wearing
 glasses


and
 that
 stuff
 actually,
 you
 know,
 you


could
 imagine
 Neuralink
 legit
 legit


legit
 becomes
 a
 massive
 company
 because


of
 those
 use
 cases.
 But
 don't
 know
 if


glasses
 is
 the
 best
 spot
 to
 to
 focus
 on.


Here's
 the
 update
 on
 SpaceX
 talking


about
 Elon.


um
 100
 billion
 seems
 to
 be
 where


investor
 markets
 are
 willing
 to
 buy.


Then
 we'll
 take
 a
 look
 at
 uh
 a
 couple
 of


the
 clips
 from
 the
 Vlad
 interview
 on
 the


compound
 which
 came
 out
 this
 morning
 as


well.


>> The
 question
 of
 just
 when
 right
 not
 if


it
 was
 going
 to
 happen.


>> Yeah.
 I
 just
 want
 to
 correct
 and
 clarify


some
 things
 for
 you
 guys
 that
 there
 are


two
 distinct
 things
 here.
 There
 is
 a


tender
 offer
 which
 is
 an
 indecider
 share


sale
 where
 basically
 SpaceX
 done
 does


this
 annually
 or
 bannually.
 It
 allows


employees
 and
 early
 investors
 to
 sell


shares
 at
 a
 specific
 price
 and
 therefore


valuation
 to
 give
 them
 some
 liquidity.


So
 the
 journal
 had
 reported
 that
 this


tender
 was
 at
 a
 share
 price
 that
 would


give
 a
 valuation
 of
 $800
 billion
 double


what
 we
 believed
 the
 valuation
 to
 be


earlier
 this
 year.
 I'm
 hearing
 that


there
 is
 a
 tender
 underway.
 It
 could


close
 by
 Monday,
 but
 actually
 the
 share


price
 I
 was
 hearing
 is
 much
 nearer
 to


$300
 a
 piece,
 which
 would
 put
 the


valuation
 nearer
 to
 $600
 billion.
 So,


this
 is
 a
 kind
 of
 live
 situation.
 The


IPO
 part
 of
 it
 is
 separate
 that,
 you


know,
 in
 communications
 with
 investors,


the
 company
 is
 saying
 that
 in
 the
 second


half
 of
 next
 year,
 2026,
 they'd
 look
 at


an
 IPO.
 And
 the
 bit
 you're
 right
 about


is
 that
 it
 would
 be
 the
 whole
 company.


Previously,
 we
 reported
 that
 one
 of
 the


ideas
 was
 that
 SpaceX
 would
 spin
 off


Starlink,
 its
 space-based,


constellation-based
 internet
 service


rather
 than
 the
 whole
 company.
 But,
 you


know,
 that
 is
 contrary
 to
 what
 the


information's
 put
 out
 this
 morning.


>> Right.
 Okay.
 Thank
 you
 for
 clarifying


that.
 There's
 a
 lot
 going
 on
 here
 with


SpaceX.
 We
 know
 investors
 are
 hungry
 for


any
 information
 they
 can
 get
 on
 it


because
 right
 now
 it's
 publicly
 it's


privately
 held
 and
 so
 you
 can't
 really


get
 access
 to
 it.
 Um,
 having
 said
 all
 of


that,
 Ed,
 Elon
 Musk
 would
 be
 the
 CEO
 of


two
 publicly
 traded
 companies
 if
 this


happens.
 Does
 his
 current
 contract
 or


his
 current
 setup
 with
 Tesla
 allow
 for


that?


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 mean,
 as
 you
 know,
 Scarlet,
 we


spoke
 to
 Tesla's
 board
 chair,
 Robin


Denholm,
 about
 this
 exact
 idea
 twice.


The
 board
 seems
 comfortable
 based
 on
 the


compensation
 agreement,
 which
 has
 now


been
 ratified
 by
 Tesla
 shareholders,


that
 Musk
 continues
 on
 at
 the
 helm
 of


other
 companies.
 And
 actually
 the
 board


went
 a
 step
 further
 to
 say
 that
 there's


value
 in
 Elon
 Musk
 having
 um
 interaction


with
 these
 companies
 because
 in
 the


future
 they
 basically
 believe
 they're


highly
 analogous.
 You
 know,
 if
 you
 think


about
 space-based
 internet
 and
 where


this
 market's
 going
 right
 now,
 a
 very


big
 concentration
 on
 the
 potential
 for


space-based
 data
 centers,
 they
 will
 see


it
 as
 a
 kind
 of
 value
 ad
 to
 have
 the


relationship
 between
 the
 two
 companies.


>> Yeah,
 that
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 as
 well.


We've
 been
 hearing
 about
 space-based


data
 centers
 for
 a
 couple
 weeks
 now.


Lots
 of
 people
 including
 Elon
 Sunder
 and


Bezos
 have
 mentioned
 it.
 I
 mean
 SpaceX


right
 now
 uh
 in
 its
 present
 day
 one


could
 argue
 deserves
 this
 valuation
 if


they
 were
 to
 be
 pivotal
 in
 the
 launching


of
 the
 materials,
 products,
 etc.
 that's


needed
 to
 actually
 build
 out
 data


centers
 in
 space
 which
 I
 mean
 why


wouldn't
 they
 be
 one
 of
 the
 core


companies
 that's
 in
 that
 ecosystem


that's
 actually
 showing
 the
 reusability


of
 the
 rockets
 to
 to
 get
 the
 job
 done.
 I


I
 would
 say
 that
 that
 should
 increase


the
 valuation
 or
 at least
 the
 perception


of
 the
 increase
 of
 the
 valuation,


especially
 when
 they
 go
 public
 and
 you


can
 own
 a
 space
 company
 that's
 building


out
 data
 centers.
 Like
 that
 would
 be


pretty
 cool.
 StarCloud.
 Yeah,
 dude.


Imagine
 StarCloud.


That'd
 be
 wild.
 Starlink
 alone,
 you


know,
 the
 growth
 of
 that
 gets
 people
 so


excited.
 So,
 it
 would
 be
 very,
 very
 cool


to
 see
 that
 end
 up
 playing
 out.
 Um
 but


as
 a
 result
 600
 to
 800
 billion
 it
 would


be
 the
 most


privately
 valued
 company
 in
 the
 market


uh
 ahead
 of
 opening
 eye
 if
 they
 do
 get


those
 tender
 offers
 at
 800
 billion.
 Um,


all right,
 folks.
 So,
 we
 have
 about
 25


minutes,
 sorry,
 35
 minutes.
 At
 5:15
 p.m.


Eastern,
 we
 will
 get
 this
 news
 on
 which


company
 gets
 included
 into
 the
 S&P
 500


uh
 to
 help
 me
 analyze
 and
 break
 this


down
 on
 this
 Friday
 afternoon


in
 December.
 Let's
 bring
 on
 someone
 and


get
 their
 thoughts
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 in


the
 markets.
 Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 Mr.


Milkman.


Steve,
 how
 are
 you?


Steve
 is
 muted,
 so
 he's
 not
 going
 to
 be


talking
 until
 he
 unmutes
 himself.


>> What's
 going
 on,
 everyone?


>> Are
 you
 in
 the
 car,
 Steve?


>> I'm
 in
 the
 car,
 man.
 Driving
 through
 the


city.


>> Are
 you
 enjoying
 driving
 through
 the


world's
 greatest
 city
 in
 traffic
 on
 a


Friday?


>> It's
 certainly
 different
 driving
 in
 the


winter
 than
 driving
 in
 the
 summer.
 The


car
 is
 freezing.
 It's
 dark
 out.
 People


beeping.


>> It
 gets
 dark
 so
 quick
 now.
 Like
 it's


actually
 insane
 how
 quick
 it
 is.


>> It
 is
 insane
 that
 4:00
 is
 dark.


>> Um,
 all right.
 So,
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk


about.
 Thank
 you
 for
 joining.
 I
 think
 I


think
 let's
 let's
 get
 your
 take
 on
 the


S&P
 first
 before
 we
 get
 into
 the
 whole


Netflix
 stuff.
 Um,
 gut
 feeling.
 Do
 you


think
 SoFi
 gets
 in
 in
 the
 next
 30


minutes?


>> No.


Uh,
 do
 you
 think
 if
 they
 did
 get
 in,
 it


would
 be
 surprising
 or
 they
 deserve
 to


get
 in
 early
 early?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 think
 I
 can
 make
 an
 argument


that
 at
 least
 50
 companies
 don't
 deserve


to
 be
 in
 it
 compared
 to
 SoFi,
 but
 I


don't
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 get
 in,
 but


I
 think
 you
 could
 say
 that
 with


anything.
 You
 know,
 when
 Hood
 got
 in,
 I


think
 we
 could
 have
 made
 the
 argument


that
 50
 companies
 didn't
 deserve
 to
 be


in
 it
 instead
 of
 Hood.
 So,


>> yeah.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 Okay,
 so
 let
 me
 throw


some
 other
 companies
 at
 you
 and
 just
 get


your
 raw
 opinion.
 Reddit.


>> I
 don't
 know
 enough
 about
 them.
 I
 think


I
 don't
 even
 understand
 why
 anybody
 uses


Reddit.
 So
 I
 mean
 seriously,
 why
 is


anybody
 going
 on
 a
 message
 board
 in


2025?
 Come
 on.


>> They
 have
 like
 a
 hundred
 million
 daily


activ


>> which
 is
 ridiculous.
 Go
 use
 X.
 Like
 what


are
 you
 people
 doing?


>> No,
 but
 there
 are
 some
 like
 crowdsourced


pieces
 of
 information
 that
 are
 unique
 to


Reddit,
 right?
 like
 on
 these
 message


boards.


>> So,


>> it's
 a
 fair
 point.
 Uh
 Carvana,


>> I
 don't
 know
 how
 that
 company's
 still
 in


business.


>> Like
 seriously.
 And
 look,
 what
 the


person
 that
 we
 were
 with
 aside,
 who
 the


hell
 is
 buying
 a
 car
 out
 of a
 vending


machine?
 Come
 on.
 Like
 really?


Look,
 I
 haven't
 understood
 it
 either,


but
 they
 have
 been
 the
 best
 performing


stock
 over
 the
 past
 five
 years,
 which
 is


>> Yeah,
 because
 they
 almost
 went
 out
 of


business
 and
 did
 some
 freaking
 debt


equity
 offering
 and
 somehow
 the
 market


just
 decided
 it
 was
 going
 to
 work.
 It


didn't
 make
 any
 sense
 then
 and
 sure
 as


all
 it
 doesn't
 make
 any
 sense
 now.


>> It's
 of
 100%
 year
 to
 date,
 too.
 Um,


here's
 one
 I
 think
 you
 I
 think
 you're


gonna
 agree
 with
 this
 one.
 Shener.


>> Shaneer
 is
 freaking
 great
 company.
 Do
 do


you
 think
 S&P
 would
 definitely


think
 twice
 about
 putting
 them
 in?


>> I'm
 surprised
 they're
 not
 in.
 How
 about


that?


>> Me,
 too.
 Me,
 too.


>> I
 agree.
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 that's
 a


candidate
 today
 that
 could
 really


>> I
 think
 it's
 a
 no-brainer
 that
 they


should
 be
 investing.


>> Okay,
 two
 more.
 Uh,
 Micro
 Strategy,
 you


think
 they
 get
 in?


>> No.


>> Why?


>> If
 Micro
 Strategy
 gets
 in,
 and
 so
 far
 it


doesn't,
 we
 have
 a
 problem.
 Like,
 we
 got


a
 problem.


Yeah,
 micro
 I
 agree
 with
 that.
 My
 only


micro


>> How
 about
 this?
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 see


Micro
 Strategy
 ever
 get
 invested
 in.
 How


about
 that?


>> Look,
 I
 get
 it
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 you're
 contingent
 on
 Bitcoin


massively
 if
 that's
 it.


>> Let
 it
 be
 its
 own
 thing
 with
 correlated


to
 Bitcoin.
 Doesn't
 need
 to
 be
 in
 the


S&P
 500.


>> Okay.
 And
 then
 last
 one,
 VRT
 Vertive.


You
 think
 they
 have
 a
 shot
 of
 getting


it?


Yeah,
 I
 guess
 so.


>> This
 is
 the
 liquid
 cooling
 data
 set.


>> I
 know
 what
 they
 are.
 Yeah,
 I
 guess
 so.


>> I
 out
 of
 all
 of
 them,
 I
 think
 Shaneer
 is


the
 one.


>> Yes,
 I
 think
 Shaneer
 is
 the
 one
 as
 well.


Shaneer,
 VRT,
 Reddit,
 I
 think,
 could
 be


the
 three,
 but


>> I
 think
 SoFi
 gets
 in
 before
 Reddit.


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 Sofi's
 been
 public
 for


four
 years,
 longer
 than
 Reddit,
 so


that's
 also


that's
 also


>> and
 they're
 a
 freaking
 bank.
 And
 we
 know


that
 some
 people
 love
 his
 financials.
 So


why
 would
 you
 [ __ ]
 turn
 here?
 What


are
 you
 doing?
 I
 swear
 to
 God,
 people


don't
 know
 how
 to
 drive.
 You
 have
 people


trying
 to
 turn,
 make
 a
 left
 from
 the


middle
 [ __ ]
 lane.


Jesus
 Christ,


>> dude.
 I
 was
 in
 a
 Uber
 in
 New
 York
 City


yesterday
 and
 that
 guy
 was,
 I
 think,
 at


least
 five
 times


almost
 getting
 ready
 to
 like
 kill
 all
 of


us
 in
 the
 car.
 I
 mean,
 the
 way
 these


people
 drive
 in
 New
 York
 is


>> Let
 me
 just
 tell
 you
 something
 and
 and


maybe
 this
 is
 why
 I
 am
 so


full
 self-driving
 and
 freaking


uh
 whatever
 they're
 called,
 cyber
 cabs


are
 not
 going
 to
 work
 for
 a
 while


because
 this
 is
 the
 most
 craziest
 place


to
 drive.
 I
 just
 I
 I
 don't
 see
 it.
 I


don't
 see
 it,


>> bro.
 Like,
 as
 I
 was
 in
 the
 Uber
 and
 I


was
 in
 a
 Tesla
 as
 well,
 but
 he
 wasn't


using
 FSD.
 We
 were
 like
 pulling
 up
 to


I'm
 like
 there's
 no
 way
 you're
 going
 to


fit
 in
 that
 space.
 And
 then
 he
 does
 a


mini
 turn
 right
 when
 we're
 about
 to
 hit


something.
 I'm
 like
 I'm
 just
 like
 how


did
 you
 do
 that?
 So
 I
 give
 a
 lot
 of


credit
 to
 the
 New
 York
 drivers
 but
 it's


also
 like
 dude
 there's
 no
 way
 I
 think
 AI


can
 navigate
 these
 streets
 yet.


>> No.
 And
 I'm
 not
 saying
 they're
 not
 going


to
 be
 able
 to.
 But
 I've
 always
 said
 five


or
 10
 years
 absolutely.
 But
 when
 I


looked
 at
 and
 I
 was
 one
 of
 the
 people


that
 was
 looked
 at
 as
 being
 crazy
 when
 I


said
 by
 2025
 2026
 this
 is
 not
 going
 to


be
 a
 real
 business
 line
 for
 Tesla.


There's
 just
 no
 way
 it's
 going
 to


happen.
 And
 it
 looks
 like
 my
 craziness


was
 correct
 because
 driving
 in
 these


conditions
 is
 very
 complex.
 This
 is
 not


going
 to
 be
 full
 self-driving
 for
 quite


some
 time.


>> I
 agree.
 All
 right.
 So,
 we
 got
 20


minutes
 until
 the
 uh
 the
 SoFi
 news,
 I


think,
 or
 I'm
 already
 calling
 it
 so
 S&P


news.
 Tanner
 will
 join
 in
 a
 bit.
 Let's


talk
 about
 Netflix.
 So,


>> let's
 talk
 about
 Netflix
 a
 minute.


>> First
 of
 all,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 say
 that
 I


think
 a
 year
 ago,
 Steve,
 this
 was


probably
 at
 $12,
 was
 saying,
 "We
 have
 to


look
 at
 Warner
 Brothers."


And
 his
 thesis
 would
 not
 Well,
 your


thesis
 was
 they
 could
 get
 bought
 up,
 but


you
 also
 just
 said,
 "Dude,
 they
 have


amazing
 assets."
 I
 was
 concerned
 about


the
 debt.
 Uh
 the
 stock's
 up
 160%


year-to-
 date.
 Apparently,
 no
 one
 cares


about
 the
 debt.
 They
 care
 about
 what
 you


mentioned
 in
 your
 original
 thesis,
 which


was
 the
 Amazing
 Assets,
 and
 it
 looks


like
 that
 has
 got
 them
 a
 buyout
 offer.


So,
 I
 guess
 I'll
 give
 you
 the
 floor,
 but


do
 you
 think
 this
 is
 the
 right
 move
 for


Netflix
 and
 the
 right
 move
 for
 Warner


Brothers
 if
 they
 acquire
 them?


>> So,
 here's
 the
 breakdown.


And
 to
 be
 fair,
 I
 am
 a
 shareholder


because
 I
 have
 my
 shares
 from
 the


spin-off
 from
 AT&T.
 I
 did
 not
 buy
 more


than
 I
 should
 have.
 I
 think
 that
 this
 is


I'm
 going
 to
 throw
 a
 conspiracy.
 You


ready
 for
 con
 conspiracy
 corner?


>> Okay,
 let's
 do
 it.


>> Netflix
 ain't
 getting
 the
 bid.


>> Okay,
 what's
 your


>> The
 regulators
 aren't
 going
 to
 let
 it
 go


through.
 It's
 going
 to
 go
 to
 Paramount.


It's
 going to
 go
 to
 Paramont.


>> Okay,
 but
 why?
 This
 is
 Why
 wouldn't
 the


regulators
 like


>> Go
 ahead.
 Why?
 They're
 not
 going
 to
 let


the
 number
 one
 and
 number
 four
 streamer


merch
 and
 let
 the
 number
 one
 streamer


get
 bigger.
 Paramount's
 like
 six
 or


seven.
 So,
 it
 would
 absolutely
 work.
 I


think
 that
 then
 you
 can
 consider
 this
 a


legit
 monopoly
 and
 this
 is
 going
 to
 have


a
 very
 hard
 time
 getting
 through.
 I


think
 Larry
 Ellison
 is
 gonna
 use
 every


trick
 in
 the
 book
 he's
 got
 with
 Trump


donate
 whatever
 he
 has
 to
 do
 to
 get
 the


freaking
 regulators
 to
 not
 approve
 this


and
 have
 Paramount
 go
 directly
 to
 the


shareholders
 and
 potentially
 up
 their


bid
 and
 pay
 the
 entire
 breakup
 fee
 of


5.8
 8
 billion
 that's
 in
 the
 contract


with
 Netflix
 and
 say,
 "Listen,
 this
 is


what
 you're
 never
 going
 to
 get
 this
 past


the
 regulators.
 They're
 never
 going
 to


approve
 it.
 Take
 our
 deal.
 We
 will
 pay


you
 the
 additional
 money
 from
 the


breakup
 thing."


>> Wow.


>> And
 here's
 why.
 This
 is
 a
 once
 in


a-lifetime
 deal.
 These
 assets
 are
 never


coming
 up
 for
 grabs
 again.
 Ellison
 and


his
 sons
 are
 going
 to
 be
 working
 the


whole
 weekend
 with
 their
 bankers.


They're
 going
 to
 figure
 something
 out.


They're
 not
 going
 down
 without
 a
 fight.


This
 is
 even
 though
 this
 seems
 like
 it's


far
 from
 over
 or
 it's
 a
 done
 deal.
 It's


far
 from
 over
 because
 this
 is
 going
 to


take
 at
 least
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 to
 get


through
 the
 regulators
 on
 the
 Netflix


side.
 Paramount
 side,
 they
 can
 get
 this


pushed
 through
 a
 lot
 quicker
 and
 I
 do


think
 that
 this
 is
 a
 situation
 where
 we


have
 not
 heard
 the
 final
 details
 yet.


And
 since
 it's
 a
 once
 in
 a-lifetime


thing,
 maybe
 the
 Ellison's
 want
 to


overpay
 in
 the
 short
 term
 because
 if


they
 don't
 get
 this
 done,
 they're


screwed.
 Paramount
 is
 screwed
 and


Netflix
 becomes
 a
 company
 you
 can't
 mess


with
 anymore.
 Now,
 from
 Netflix,
 it's
 a


it's
 an
 amazing
 deal.
 They're
 paying
 up


and
 they
 should
 pay
 up
 and
 it
 would
 be


an
 amazing
 deal
 for
 anybody.
 As
 I've


been
 saying,
 Apple
 should
 have
 bought


them.
 Netflix
 should
 have
 bought
 them.


Amazon
 should
 have
 bought
 them.
 Warner


Brothers
 has
 the
 crown
 jewel
 assets.
 And


for
 Netflix,
 they
 not
 only
 gain
 Warner


Brothers
 Studios
 and
 the
 entire
 content


library,
 they
 gain


HBO
 and
 HBO
 Max
 and
 all
 the
 content.
 And


they
 can
 now
 produce
 all
 their
 TV
 shows


and
 their
 movies
 through
 Warner


Brothers.


>> I
 think
 you
 made
 a
 couple
 really
 good


points
 here.
 The
 number
 one
 point
 that


these
 are
 assets
 that
 will
 never
 be
 up


for
 sale
 again.
 Um,
 by
 the
 way
 guys,


Steve's
 YouTube
 right
 there,
 so
 please


make
 sure
 to
 subscribe
 to
 him
 as
 well.
 I


think
 that's
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 point
 because
 I


mean
 there's
 not
 many
 times
 the
 Harry


Potter
 franchise
 gets
 just
 passed


around.
 So


>> yeah,
 you
 are
 right
 that
 this
 this
 is
 a


big
 deal,
 Game
 of
 Thrones,
 all
 that


stuff.
 The
 question
 I
 would
 have
 to
 you


is
 you're
 saying
 they're
 going
 to
 be


viewed
 as
 monopoly,
 but
 what
 if


Netflix's
 argument
 is
 uh
 we
 compete
 with


YouTube,
 so
 we
 can't
 seriously
 we
 like


the
 attention
 economy
 is
 so
 wide
 you


can't
 say
 we're
 a
 monopoly.


So,
 and
 I
 think
 that
 is
 what
 they're


going
 to
 say
 and
 I
 think
 that
 that
 is


part
 of
 their
 whole
 thing
 that
 this
 is


not
 just
 CBS
 versus
 Paramont
 versus


Disney.
 This
 is
 an
 intention


and
 environment
 with
 YouTube
 and
 Prime


and
 all
 these
 other
 things
 and
 it's


watchtime
 not
 subscriptions.
 But
 I
 think


the
 counter
 to
 that
 really
 is
 this
 is


still
 streaming
 TV
 and
 streaming
 movies


and
 Netflix
 is
 already
 the
 dominant


factor.
 And
 when
 you
 add
 the


subscriptions,
 I
 mean,
 HBO
 Max
 has
 what,


33
 million
 people
 or
 something
 like


that.


>> No,
 actually,
 dude,
 I
 saw
 today
 HBO
 Max


has
 130
 million
 subscribers.


>> 130
 million
 subscribers.
 When
 you
 add


that
 into
 the
 Netflix
 platform,
 they


become
 a
 uber
 monopoly
 and
 they
 become
 a


much
 more
 larger
 number
 one.
 This
 isn't


number
 two
 and
 number
 three
 competing
 to


go
 headto-head
 with
 number
 one.
 This
 is


number
 one
 taking
 out
 number
 four
 to
 to


make
 the
 gap
 even
 wider.
 And
 I
 think


that
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 something
 that


regulators
 are
 gonna
 have
 a
 very
 hard


time
 with.
 And
 I
 do
 think
 Paramont's


going
 to
 try
 to
 come
 over
 the
 top
 and


figure
 something
 out
 and
 try
 to
 go


directly
 to
 the
 shareholders
 in
 the


board
 and
 say,
 "Listen,
 with
 us,
 wink


wink,
 nod
 nod,
 it's
 going
 to
 go
 through.


The
 Donald's
 already
 blessed
 it.
 We're


going
 to
 up
 the
 deal.
 We'll
 we'll
 give


you
 the
 5.8
 a
 breakup
 fee
 that
 is
 going


to
 be
 in
 Netflix's
 thing
 will
 up
 it


somehow.
 They're
 going
 to
 try
 to
 figure


out
 a
 way
 to
 snake
 Netflix
 on
 this.


>> You
 think
 they
 work
 a
 different
 story?


>> You
 think
 they
 paid
 six
 billion
 just
 to


get


>> feed?
 Yes.


>> Okay.
 So
 then
 here's
 the
 follow-up


question.
 Why
 does
 Larry
 Ellison,
 who's


the
 CEO
 of
 Oracle,
 which
 is
 a
 way
 better


opportunity
 than
 whatever
 is
 in
 media,


why
 does
 he
 care
 so
 much
 about
 this?


>> Because
 his
 sons
 are
 running
 Paramot.


>> Yeah.
 But
 like


does
 so
 he
 just
 wants
 his
 son
 to
 like
 be


really
 successful?
 Is
 that
 the


motivation
 here
 to
 pay
 40
 billion


dollars?
 Like
 you
 know
 what
 I'm
 saying?


It's
 just
 it's


>> Yes,
 that
 was
 me
 beeping.


>> We
 We
 heard
 we
 we
 heard.


>> I'm
 just
 making
 it
 clear.


>> Yeah.
 Okay.
 Um
 Yeah.
 Why
 do
 you
 think
 he


like
 why
 do
 you
 think
 that
 he
 cares
 so


much
 about
 Paramount
 and
 their
 success?


I
 guess


>> you
 know
 I
 don't
 know
 probably
 because


he's
 just
 bankrolling
 his
 sons
 and
 he


thinks
 that
 this
 is
 the
 future
 and
 that


legacy
 media
 is
 going
 to
 continue
 to


crumble.
 I
 mean
 look
 the
 Netflix
 deal
 is


a
 really
 good
 deal
 for
 Warner
 Brothers


shareholders.
 When
 you
 look
 at
 the


entire
 deal,
 you're
 getting
 24
 24
 and
 a


half
 in
 the
 cash.
 You're
 getting
 another


couple
 of
 bucks
 on
 equity
 and
 you're


getting
 the
 remaining
 legacy
 TV
 channels


in
 a
 Spinco
 company.
 It's
 a
 really
 good


deal.
 Okay,
 the
 Spinco
 company
 will
 be


loaded
 up
 with
 a
 considerable
 amount
 of


debt.
 Not
 all
 the
 debt
 will
 end
 up
 on


Netflix's
 balance
 sheet.
 It's
 a
 really


good
 deal,
 but
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 better


deal
 to
 be
 had
 with
 Paramont.
 I
 really


do.


All
 right.
 So,
 that's
 your
 take.
 Your


take
 is
 this
 doesn't
 go
 through.
 Um,


there
 was
 some
 reporting
 this
 morning


that
 Trump
 is
 not
 a
 fan
 of
 Netflix
 and


their
 collaboration
 with


>> No.
 Oh,
 and
 here's
 the
 other
 thing.


Got
 to
 remember
 what
 it
 And
 here's


conspiracy
 corner
 part
 two.
 You
 ready


for
 this
 on
 steroids?


>> Okay,
 go
 ahead.


>> What
 asset
 does
 Warner
 Brothers


Discovery
 own
 that
 Trump
 hates?


Okay,
 let's
 think
 about
 this
 for
 a


second.
 Put
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you
 know
 the


answer
 to
 this.
 What
 asset
 does
 Warner


Oh,
 all
 righty.
 Yeah.
 Well,


>> all
 right.
 So,
 what
 asset
 is
 it?


>> CNN.


>> Okay.
 Do
 you
 think
 he
 wants
 CNN
 run
 by


Netflix
 or
 CNN
 run
 by
 the
 Ellisons?


>> That's
 a
 really
 good


>> I'm
 just
 saying.


>> I
 I
 I'm
 not
 I
 don't
 think
 that's
 even


too
 much
 of
 a
 conspiracy
 to
 be
 honest.


>> I'm
 just
 saying.
 Let's
 play
 chestnut


checkers.


>> I
 mean,


>> you
 don't
 think
 that
 Larry
 Ellison
 went


to
 Trump
 is
 like,
 "Listen,
 I
 get
 a
 hold


of
 these
 guys,
 CNN's
 becoming
 Fox
 2.0."


You
 think
 he
 didn't
 say
 that
 to
 I
 would


say
 that
 to
 Trump.


>> Now,
 granted,
 they're
 not
 buying
 the
 the


stream
 the
 the
 TV
 networks
 though,


right?
 Or
 that
 that's
 a
 spin-off
 into
 a


public
 company.
 But
 who's
 to
 say
 that


they
 don't
 just
 [ __ ]
 carve
 that
 out


into
 that
 doesn't
 make
 it
 into
 the
 spin


cup?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 from
 what
 I
 read
 on
 the


deal
 this
 morning,
 they're
 they're
 going


to
 Discovery
 Global
 Plus
 will
 turn
 into


a
 public
 company
 that'll
 include
 all
 the


streaming
 or
 the
 the
 TV
 stuff
 and


Netflix
 will
 acquire
 the
 studios.
 But
 to


your
 point,
 and
 this
 was
 reported
 in
 the


morning
 as
 well,
 it's
 consistent
 with


what
 you're
 saying.
 You
 know,
 CNBC
 said


that
 Trump
 is
 not
 happy
 that
 Obama
 uh


production
 company
 uh
 has
 a
 relationship


with
 Netflix.
 And
 you
 know,
 then
 you've


got
 all
 the
 sort
 of
 woke
 controversy


around
 Netflix.
 So
 like
 there
 could
 be
 a


broad
 argument
 that
 the
 administration


doesn't
 want
 to
 make
 this
 company
 uber


powerful


>> and
 have
 them
 create
 content
 that
 is


obviously
 not
 on
 the
 side
 of
 having


>> and
 keep
 in
 mind
 that's
 the
 deal
 from


Netflix.
 That's
 not
 the
 deal
 from


Paramount.
 So
 Netflix
 is
 the
 one
 that's


spinning
 everything
 out
 into
 a
 spin
 with


legacy
 media.
 Ellison
 could
 very
 well
 go


to
 Trump
 like,
 "Hey,
 don't
 worry.
 We're


going
 to
 keep
 CNN
 part
 of
 us."
 And
 We'll


take
 care
 of
 CNN.
 Don't
 worry
 about
 it.


>> I
 mean,
 they're
 already
 doing
 this
 with


CBS,
 right?
 Like
 CBS
 is
 starting
 to
 Who


would
 have
 thought
 Poly
 Market
 would
 get


a
 60
 Minute
 special?


>> Just
 saying.


>> I
 mean,
 like,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 the
 old


CBS
 would
 have
 done
 that,
 but
 Poly


Market
 was
 instrumental
 in
 determining


that
 Trump
 was
 going
 to
 win
 the
 election


before
 the
 polls,
 right?
 So,
 Poly
 Market


is
 a
 direct
 middle
 finger
 to
 every


mainstream
 media
 poll
 that
 was
 out
 there


because
 they
 all
 got
 it
 wrong.
 And
 then


CBS
 gave
 Poly
 Market
 a
 big
 piece
 last


last
 week
 as
 well.
 So


>> look,
 Ellison
 didn't
 get
 to
 where
 he
 is


by
 losing.
 He
 didn't
 get
 to
 where
 he
 is


by
 not
 getting
 acquisitions
 done.
 And


just
 because
 it
 looks
 like
 Netflix
 won


right
 now


does
 not
 mean
 that
 this
 is
 going
 to
 pass


and
 it
 does
 not
 mean
 that
 this
 is
 over.


Paramount
 can
 go
 to
 the
 shareholders,


they
 can
 come
 up
 with
 another
 deal
 and


they
 can
 get
 something
 done.
 And
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day,
 they
 do
 have
 the


administration
 on
 speed
 dial,
 whereas


Netflix
 does
 not.
 The
 administration
 is


not
 a
 fan
 of
 Netflix,
 but
 they
 are
 a
 fan


of
 Ellison
 and
 the
 Ellison
 team.
 So,


when
 push
 comes
 to
 shove,
 oh,
 no


problem.
 You
 need
 another
 five
 billion


to
 fund
 all
 the
 uh
 accounts.
 Don't


worry,
 we'll
 make
 it
 six
 and
 a
 half.


We'll
 match
 Michael
 Dell.
 We'll
 we'll


give
 you
 more
 even
 more
 for
 the
 Trump


accounts.
 Don't
 worry.


>> This
 isn't
 over.
 Also,
 Paramount
 has


links
 to
 the
 UFC,
 right?


>> The
 UFC
 has


>> UFC
 has
 I
 mean,
 Dana
 White
 and
 Trump
 are


both
 I
 mean,
 the
 more
 I
 think
 about
 it,


the
 more
 you
 have
 an
 argument.
 You


definitely
 have
 an
 argument.


>> All
 I'm
 saying
 is
 this
 isn't
 over,
 Gab.


That's
 all
 I'm
 saying.
 Now,
 maybe


Netflix
 does
 get
 this
 done,
 but
 it's


certainly
 not
 going
 to
 be
 over
 for
 at


least
 a
 year,
 year
 and
 a
 half
 with


getting
 it
 through
 the
 regulators.
 This


is
 not
 a
 very
 small
 deal.
 And
 this


really
 does
 make
 a
 monopoly.
 So


>> So
 So
 you
 would
 you
 wouldn't
 buy
 you


wouldn't
 buy
 Netflix
 here?


>> No,
 I
 wouldn't.


>> And
 just
 the
 yearly
 overhang
 that
 might


exist
 on
 Netflix
 is
 another
 reason
 why


you
 would
 stay
 away
 from
 it
 here


>> because
 we
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 going
 to


get
 done.
 And
 here's
 the
 thing,
 you're


betting
 it
 gets
 done
 if
 you're
 going
 to


buy
 Netflix
 here.
 What
 if
 you
 buy


Netflix
 here
 and
 it
 doesn't
 get
 done
 in


a
 year?
 What
 happens
 to
 the
 stock?
 Does


it
 go
 down
 10%,
 5%,
 20%,
 or
 does
 it
 go


up?
 I
 have
 no
 idea.
 I
 still
 think
 I'd


rather
 be
 in
 Amazon
 or
 Meta
 than
 Netflix


here.


>> The
 other
 thing
 is
 you
 got
 to
 ask


yourself
 why
 Netflix
 wanted
 this
 bid
 so


badly.
 And
 like
 yes,
 your
 argument
 is


right
 about
 the
 the
 assets
 are
 so
 good.


But
 also,
 they
 might
 be
 thinking,
 dude,


we
 might
 not
 have
 that
 many
 bangers
 for


2026,
 which
 means
 if
 we
 can't
 grow
 as


much
 as
 we
 thought
 and
 we
 don't
 get
 this


big,


>> the
 content
 on
 Netflix
 sucks.


Yeah,
 I
 I
 agree
 with
 that.


>> I
 mean,
 in
 all
 seriousness,
 is
 there


anything
 on
 there
 you
 really
 want
 to


watch?


>> No.


>> Exactly.


>> Now,
 people
 people
 say
 Stranger
 Things


and
 all
 that
 stuff,
 but
 again,
 those
 are


not
 there's
 not
 as
 many
 of
 those.


>> Yeah,
 but
 but
 after
 you're
 done
 watching


the
 new
 season
 of
 Stranger
 Things,
 what


else
 are
 you
 watching?


>> And
 then
 when
 you
 try
 to
 watch


something,
 it's
 like
 leaving
 soon.
 I'm


like,
 well,
 why
 did
 you
 even
 bring
 it
 on


the
 platform?
 Like,
 if
 you
 can't
 keep
 it


for
 at least
 a
 year,
 you
 know?


>> And
 that's
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 this


is
 so
 important
 for
 Netflix.
 Because
 if


the
 and
 think
 about
 the
 expense
 side,


right?


HBO
 Max
 and
 all
 the
 content
 on
 it,
 you


throw
 it
 on
 Netflix's
 servers,
 you


integrated
 into
 Netflix,
 and
 you
 get
 rid


of
 all
 the
 costs
 associated
 with
 HBO.


You
 no
 longer
 pay
 for
 any
 of
 those


streaming
 costs
 for
 hosting
 and
 all
 that


stuff.
 It's
 just
 it's
 a
 bolt-on


acquisition.
 So,
 you
 make
 the
 Netflix


library
 so
 robust
 that
 it's
 almost


mandatory
 that
 you
 have
 to
 have
 a


subscription.


Tanner,
 what's
 up?


>> What's
 up,
 guys?


>> What
 is
 your
 take
 on
 this
 Netflix


headline?


>> Um,
 I
 mean,
 my
 opinions
 aren't
 too


strong,
 but
 I
 think


uh
 the
 the
 government
 should
 step
 in
 if


it's
 bad
 for
 customers,
 and
 I
 don't


think
 that
 this
 is
 bad
 for
 customers.
 I


think
 all
 Netflix


um
 you
 know,
 customers
 would
 love
 to


have
 this
 IP
 as
 part
 of
 their


subscription.
 And
 maybe
 the
 price
 goes


up,
 but
 it's
 ne
 probably
 will
 not
 go
 up


at
 the
 rate
 of
 owning
 both
 HBO
 Max
 and


Netflix.
 So,
 I
 actually
 think
 on
 the


other
 side,
 I
 think
 there's
 going
 to
 be


a
 little
 bit
 of
 um
 cannibalization.
 Like


a
 lot
 of
 the
 280
 plus
 million
 Netflix


subscribers,
 I
 bet
 there's
 a
 little
 bit


of
 an
 overlap
 on
 the
 ven
 diagram
 of
 the


130
 million
 HBO
 Max
 users.


So,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 they
 can
 shut
 it


down
 if
 it's
 not
 if
 if
 customers
 are


really
 excited
 that
 this
 happens,


you
 know,
 on
 the
 political
 side.
 I've


got
 no
 take.
 Um,
 all
 that
 stuff
 about


CNN
 and
 stuff.
 I
 mean,
 I'll
 I'll
 let
 you


guys
 run
 with
 that,
 but
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 just


looking
 at
 it
 from


>> you.
 You
 stream
 to
 Americans
 every
 day.


You
 got
 to
 have
 a
 take
 there.


>> No,
 no,
 no.
 Leave
 me
 out
 of
 it.
 But,


usually
 I'm
 the
 one
 that
 wants
 to
 be


down
 the
 middle.
 What?


>> Steve
 says
 you


>> I'm
 the
 one.


>> Yeah.


>> Well,
 in
 this
 case,
 it's
 Tanner.
 Okay.


So,
 Tanner,
 do
 you
 do
 you
 would
 you
 be


interested
 in
 Netflix
 stock
 just
 given


the
 conditions
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 here?


>> Uh,
 no,
 not
 personally.
 I
 don't
 like
 the


fact
 that
 they
 have
 to
 pay
 for
 content


constantly
 and
 they
 don't
 know
 the
 the


take
 on
 the
 other
 side.
 I
 just
 think


like
 YouTube
 is
 just
 such
 like
 YouTube


doesn't
 make
 any
 bets
 on
 what's
 going
 to


be
 viral
 or
 what's
 not
 there
 and
 they


pay
 every
 creator
 equally
 and
 they
 go


out
 and
 decide
 what
 what's
 hot
 and


what's
 not.
 And
 you
 have


comedians
 putting
 out
 specials
 on


YouTube
 like
 full
 produced
 specials.
 You


have
 uh
 Mr.
 Beast
 putting
 out
 movies


that
 are
 insane
 quality,
 tens
 and
 tens


of
 millions
 of
 dollars.


uh
 into
 individual
 YouTube
 videos.
 I


just
 think
 that's
 the
 future.
 It's


working.
 There's
 no
 reason
 why
 it's
 not.


So,
 I
 I
 like
 that
 as
 a
 better
 approach,


and
 I'm
 just
 more
 of
 a
 YouTube
 person.


But
 Netflix
 got
 its
 grips
 on
 me.
 I
 still


pay
 for
 the
 the
 subscription.
 You
 were


talking
 some
 smack
 on
 Stranger
 Things.
 I


mean,
 it's
 an
 amazing
 show,
 so
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 have
 that.


The
 Stranger
 Things
 is
 perfect.
 Like,
 I


don't
 know what
 you
 want
 from
 me.


>> Oh,
 the
 first
 season
 was
 perfect.
 It


went
 downhill
 every
 season
 going


forward.
 I'll
 agree
 with
 that.
 But
 it


went
 from
 a
 10
 and
 now
 on
 season
 five


it's
 at
 a
 9.5.


>> I
 mean
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I
 would
 say
 9.5


but
 sure
 we
 can
 disagree
 on
 that.


>> Yeah.
 I'm
 not
 having
 I'm
 with
 Michelle.


I
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 some


stranger
 things
 happen
 today
 in
 12


minutes
 when
 the
 S&P
 500.
 So
 let
 let's


get
 into
 that
 conversation.


Um
 Tanner
 is
 SoFi
 getting
 in?
 What
 do


you
 think?


I
 put
 it
 probably
 at
 like
 a
 10%
 chance,


like
 really
 really
 low.
 I'm
 not
 banking


on
 it,
 but
 um
 you
 know,
 we
 were


streaming
 all
 the
 times
 that
 Robin
 Hood


was
 supposed
 to
 get
 in.
 And
 then
 the
 one


time
 where
 I'm
 like,
 "Okay,
 they're
 not


going
 to
 get
 in.
 I've
 done
 this
 before.


I'm
 just
 going
 to
 go
 for
 a
 long
 drive."


They
 got
 in
 that
 time.
 So
 I
 I


>> The
 one
 time
 you
 were
 traveling,
 they


got
 in.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 whatever.
 So
 maybe
 me
 streaming


right
 now,
 maybe
 this
 is
 a
 bad
 sign.
 Who


knows?


Good
 luck,
 Sean.


>> But
 if
 Reddit
 gets
 in,
 I
 think
 it's
 a


little
 early.
 Um,


like
 just
 them
 being
 a
 public
 company,


they
 haven't
 really
 been
 public
 for
 very


long.
 So,
 it
 might
 be
 a
 little
 early
 for


them,
 but
 their
 growth
 and
 and
 the


quality
 of
 the
 business,
 I
 think,
 is


worthy
 of
 the
 S&P
 500.
 And
 a
 bunch
 of


people
 are
 talking
 up
 the
 quality
 of
 the


S&P,
 saying
 like
 none
 of
 the
 companies


are
 should
 be
 uh
 entered
 into
 the
 S&P


500.
 like
 some
 very
 very
 small
 companies


in
 the
 S&P
 500.
 I
 think
 it's
 almost
 like


200
 companies
 that
 if
 they
 were
 to


reapply
 at
 their
 current
 market
 caps
 or


current
 profitability,
 they
 wouldn't


even
 be
 eligible
 right
 now.
 200
 of
 the


uh
 you
 know
 500
 businesses.
 It
 It's


pretty
 incredible.
 So,
 do
 I
 think
 that


SoFi
 and
 Reddit
 and
 Shener
 and
 all
 of


these
 other
 businesses
 deserve
 to
 be
 in


more
 than
 those
 companies?
 Yeah.


>> Okay.
 So,
 basically,
 you're
 saying
 SoFi


has
 a
 chance
 to
 get
 in,
 but
 you're
 not


counting
 on
 it.
 Um,
 and
 you
 think
 the


other
 companies
 deserve
 it
 more.
 If
 they


did
 get
 in,
 would
 it
 be
 surprising
 to


you
 at
 this
 moment,
 or
 would
 it
 kind
 of


just
 be
 like,
 well,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 the
 S&P
 did
 need
 uh
 a
 high
 quality


company,
 and
 SoFi
 is
 growing
 at
 40%.


>> So,
 I
 bought
 SoFi
 today.
 Um,
 they
 they


diluted
 4.8%
 8%
 of
 the
 outstanding


shares
 and
 they
 fell
 by
 more
 than
 that.


They
 fell
 by
 like
 7%
 at
 one
 point
 which


is
 sort
 of
 take
 like
 it
 should
 have
 fell


by
 4.8%.
 If
 also
 you're
 not
 assuming


that
 they
 got
 anything
 for
 it
 but
 they


got
 1.7
 billion
 for
 it.
 So
 um
 you
 know


the
 the
 the
 company
 has
 a
 stronger


balance
 sheet
 and
 we
 don't
 know
 what


they're
 going
 to
 do
 with
 it
 yet.
 If
 they


were
 to
 just
 put
 it
 all
 towards
 their


their
 warehouse
 facilities,
 which
 they


have
 about
 $2
 billion
 in
 warehouse


facilities
 paying
 out
 5.3%.
 That's
 a


hundred
 million
 extra
 per
 year
 that


would
 go
 to
 the
 bottom
 line.
 So,
 this


does
 increase
 their
 growth.
 It
 does


increase
 their
 profitability.
 Maybe
 it


goes
 to
 an
 acquisition.
 I
 don't
 know.


But,
 um,
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 fell
 more
 than


what
 they
 diluted
 by
 and
 the
 company


ended
 up
 strengthening
 its
 position,
 I


thought
 was
 a
 good
 dip
 purchase.
 And


then
 over
 the
 next
 year
 if
 you
 include


today
 and
 then
 the
 next
 four
 rebalances


that's
 five
 chances
 along
 with
 you
 know


mergers
 and
 acquisitions
 like
 uh
 Warner


Brothers
 and
 Netflix
 that
 would
 open
 up


another
 slot
 like
 like
 these
 types
 of


acquisitions.


I
 just
 think
 SoFi
 is
 going
 to
 get
 in
 at


least
 in
 the
 next
 12
 months
 and
 my
 money


is
 well
 placed
 in
 that
 company
 until


then.


>> This
 is
 going
 to
 be
 exciting.
 We
 got
 10


minutes.
 This
 is
 going
 to
 be
 exciting.


Um,
 Tanner,
 Verive,
 Viva,
 Micro


Strategy,
 any
 of
 these
 you
 think
 have
 a


better
 shot?


>> I
 know
 you
 said
 I


>> I
 don't
 know
 about
 Micro
 Strategy,
 but


uh,
 Verdive.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 Carvana


maybe.
 Um,
 Toast
 I
 actually
 don't
 think


is
 eligible.
 I
 read
 something.
 I
 I
 wrote


Morgan
 Stanley,
 but
 it
 was
 actually


Truis.
 I
 went
 back
 and
 checked,
 but


Truis
 wrote
 that
 they're
 not
 even


eligible
 right
 now.
 Um,
 but


all
 of
 these
 other
 names.
 I
 mean,
 Copang


would
 be
 pretty
 exciting.


I
 don't
 I'm
 not
 sure.
 I'm
 not
 sure.
 If


Reddit
 gets
 in,
 I'm
 still
 going
 to


celebrate.
 I
 hold
 that
 one,
 but


everything
 else,
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 hold


anything
 else
 on
 this
 list.


>> Steve,
 what
 was
 your
 thoughts
 on
 the


dilution?


>> I
 think
 it's
 great.
 You
 know,
 I


discussed
 it
 yesterday
 that
 if
 you
 don't


believe
 in
 Dodto
 and
 Chris
 Le
 Point,


then
 you
 shouldn't
 own
 the
 stock.
 The


last
 time
 that
 they
 did
 this
 was
 right


after
 Q3
 earnings
 and
 the
 stock


immediately
 took
 a
 hit
 and
 then
 it
 came


back
 and
 we
 should
 trust
 that
 the
 CEO


and
 CFO
 know
 what
 they're
 doing.
 And
 if


you're
 worried
 about
 dilution,
 don't
 be


a
 shareholder.
 The
 reality
 is
 I'd
 rather


them
 issue
 shares
 and
 dilute
 us
 for
 what


what
 their
 future
 plans
 are
 going
 to
 be


than
 to
 tap
 the
 debt
 markets
 and
 not


only
 have
 to
 pay
 the
 debt
 back
 but
 incur


reoccurring
 interest
 charges.


>> Tanner,
 you
 agree
 with
 that
 or
 you
 think


the


>> Yeah,
 I
 just
 wonder
 what
 they
 even
 need


the
 money
 for.
 like
 even
 if
 it
 was
 going


to
 be
 uh
 an
 acquisition,
 what
 I
 was
 also


thinking
 is
 like
 why
 don't
 you
 just


offer
 them
 stock
 then
 at
 the
 time
 that


the
 acquisition
 actually
 closes
 like


you
 know
 you
 have
 a
 certain
 amount
 of


cash.
 They're
 already
 way
 over


capitalized.
 They
 just
 raised
 another


$1.7
 billion
 like
 3
 months
 ago.
 So
 this


is
 $3.4
 billion
 that
 they've
 raised
 in


the
 last
 like
 three
 four
 months.


>> I
 don't
 know
 what
 they're
 up
 to.


All
 we
 can
 say
 is
 that
 No
 has
 two
 more


tanches.
 He
 needs
 to
 hit
 35
 and
 45.


Better
 believe
 that
 in
 the
 next
 six


months
 they're
 looking
 at
 making
 a


splash
 because
 they
 have
 to
 have
 that


out
 of
 it
 share
 price
 for
 90
 days.
 So


whatever
 they're
 going
 to
 do,
 they
 got


to
 get
 it
 done
 the
 next
 freaking


bigger
 100
 days.


it.
 So,
 so
 someone
 in
 the
 chat
 says
 it's


not
 much
 cash,
 but
 the
 way
 that
 um
 the


lending
 works
 for
 SoFi
 is
 that
 they
 can


give
 out
 about
 $9.5
 times
 more
 for
 every


dollar
 that
 they
 have
 as
 book
 value.
 So,


essentially,
 whenever
 they
 raise
 $3.4


billion,
 they
 can
 give
 out
 $32
 billion


more
 in
 loans.
 Their
 full
 loan
 book
 is


$33
 billion.
 They've
 essentially
 doubled


the
 capacity
 of
 their
 loan
 book
 over
 the


last
 4
 months.
 like
 it
 is
 very
 very
 big


how
 much
 money
 they've
 just
 raised.


>> And
 look,
 you
 can
 also
 look
 at
 it
 like


this.
 They
 may
 want
 to
 increase
 their


lending
 capability
 in
 the
 short
 term


because
 if
 new
 Fed
 share
 gets
 rates
 much


lower
 over
 the
 next
 six
 months
 or
 new


Fed
 chair
 gets
 in
 then
 after
 he
 takes


over
 the
 next
 six
 months,
 they'll
 be


able
 to
 sell
 those
 loans
 for
 a
 much
 high


not
 much
 higher
 but
 for
 a
 good
 profit


because
 they'll
 be
 more
 valuable
 because


of
 a
 bigger
 yield.
 So
 they
 may
 be


looking
 at
 something
 like
 that
 also
 as


opposed
 to
 an
 acquisition.
 Who
 knows?


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 going
 on
 what
 Steve
 said


uh
 just
 a
 second
 ago,
 he
 he
 said
 like


Anthony
 Notto
 does
 have
 his
 tanches.
 He


has
 three
 like
 people
 are
 thinking
 like


he's
 going
 to
 use
 this
 money
 or
 or


somehow
 it
 goes
 into
 not's
 pocket
 or


something.
 He
 has
 $350
 million
 in
 this


stock
 that
 he
 just
 diluted.
 He's
 getting


hit
 a
 lot
 harder
 than
 me.
 He's
 getting


hit
 a
 lot
 harder
 than
 me
 and
 Steve.
 You


know,
 maybe
 not
 Steve.
 I
 don't
 know how


big
 his
 portfolio
 is
 these
 days,
 but


>> he
 has
 like
 150,000
 shares
 of
 SoFi
 just


ready
 to
 dump
 it.
 He's
 he's
 like
 waiting


to
 dump,
 but
 he's
 holding
 on.


>> No,
 but
 that's
 that's
 a
 good
 point
 that


you
 know,
 keep
 in
 mind
 is
 one
 of the


largest
 shareholders
 of
 this
 company.


So,
 he's


>> and
 performancebased
 stock
 unit.
 So,


he's
 affecting
 that
 payout
 as
 well.


>> Exactly.
 He's
 not
 going
 to
 do
 anything


that's
 going
 to
 put
 his
 own
 net
 worth
 in


jeopardy
 in
 addition
 to
 him
 not
 getting


those
 other
 two
 tranches.
 Maybe
 he


doesn't
 get
 the
 45,
 but
 you
 got
 to
 think


there's
 a
 good
 chance
 he
 gets
 the
 35


trunch.


>> Yeah,
 the
 incentives
 are
 aligned
 with


shareholders.
 So,
 I
 I I
 honestly
 do


trust
 him


>> 100%.


>> Uh
 Pamela,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Thanks
 to
 Emit,
 Stephen,
 Tanner,
 you


guys
 are
 my
 stock
 friends.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 definitely


means
 a
 lot
 uh
 for
 everyone
 to
 be
 here


on
 occasions
 like
 this.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is


why
 we
 do
 it,
 right?
 These
 are
 the


moments
 that
 get
 everyone
 excited.
 In


about
 five
 minutes,
 all
 of
 us
 together,


we'll
 see
 if
 they
 get
 in.


Um
 I
 I
 do
 Why
 are
 Why
 are
 people
 posting


the
 S&P
 said
 no
 companies
 are
 getting


in?


Are
 you
 seeing
 this,
 Tanner?
 I
 don't


have
 a
 source
 for
 it,
 but
 I'm
 seeing
 a


lot
 of
 people
 post
 this.


>> I
 saw
 Tim
 post
 that,
 but
 I
 don't


>> I
 saw
 two
 other
 people
 besides
 Tim
 also


post.
 I'm
 like,
 where
 are
 they?


>> Where
 the
 hell
 are
 they
 getting
 that


information?


>> Yeah.
 Where?


And
 then,
 all right,
 dude.
 This
 is
 why


you
 can't
 trust
 Twitter.
 Me
 and
 Tanner


learned
 the
 hard
 way
 in
 June
 with
 Robin


that
 people
 are
 just
 posting
 [ __ ]
 at


this
 point.


>> Yeah.
 You'll
 see
 these
 companies
 run
 up


and
 down
 on
 no
 news
 at
 5:15.


So,
 I'm
 not
 calling
 it
 until
 like


Bloomberg,
 like
 we
 get
 an
 official
 post


either
 from
 Standard
 and
 Pores.


Honestly,
 it
 should
 just
 be
 from


standard
 reports.
 I
 think
 it
 was


actually
 Bloomberg
 one
 of
 those
 times


that
 ended
 up
 leaking
 something
 that


wasn't
 true.


>> Well,
 we
 appreciate
 everyone
 being
 here


and
 again,
 thank
 you
 all
 for
 taking
 the


time
 to
 be
 with
 us
 to
 see
 if
 this


happens.
 I'll
 do
 one
 final
 poll
 in
 the


chat
 so
 I
 can
 pick
 four
 names.
 Which
 one


do
 you
 think
 gets
 in
 to
 the
 S&P?


>> We'll
 do
 with


>> I
 think
 Reddit,
 SoFi,
 VRT,
 and
 then


MSTR.
 Those
 are
 the
 main
 ones
 that


people
 care.


>> What
 about
 OMG?


Jun
 is
 gonna
 get
 in.


>> Yeah,
 I
 would
 put
 LG
 on
 that
 list.


>> All
 right,
 MSTR,
 I'll
 replace
 with
 LG.


Even
 though
 the
 MSR
 for
 that


>> before
 we
 get
 this
 whole
 thing
 and
 we


discuss
 who
 gets
 in.
 How
 crazy
 is
 it


that
 I
 had
 Nostradamus
 moment?


>> Dude,


Steve
 is
 he's
 calling
 the
 shots
 these


days.
 He's
 Mr.
 Market.


>> He's
 got
 a
 I
 don't
 know.
 You
 You
 have


Mark
 Zuckerberg's
 number
 or
 something.


>> Oh,
 the
 Meta
 stuff.
 Yeah,


>> it
 was
 on
 Wednesday
 night.
 I
 was
 telling


Tanner
 that
 all
 Zuckerberg
 needs
 to
 do


is
 come
 out
 and
 say
 that


>> cut
 out
 a
 little bit
 there,
 Steve.


>> We're
 cut.


>> Yeah,
 somebody
 called
 me.
 We're
 cutting


the
 uh


metaverse
 spend
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 shift


it
 to
 AI.
 And
 then
 next
 thing
 you
 know,


they
 come
 out
 and
 say
 they're
 shifting


30%.


>> Yeah.
 And
 that's
 what
 happened.
 That's


ex
 I
 mean
 you
 were
 dead
 on
 the
 money
 on


that.


>> Yeah,
 literally
 like
 and
 I
 mean
 it
 was


10
 hours
 before
 they
 announced
 it
 like


the
 night
 before.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 look
 Meta
 once
 again
 585
 to


670.
 Massive
 move
 for
 anyone
 who
 took


real
 advantage
 of
 that.
 And
 the
 question


is
 just
 now
 how
 it
 plays
 out
 towards
 the


end
 of
 the
 year.
 We
 got
 two
 minutes


folks.
 I
 have
 multiple
 screens
 open.


Let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 this.
 I'm
 sure


the
 website
 will
 crash
 again.
 But
 you've


got
 people
 already
 posting.
 I
 don't
 know


where
 they're
 getting
 this
 from
 that


there's
 no
 rebalance.


>> I
 think
 it's
 trolls
 and
 they're


reposting
 the
 trolls
 cuz


>> Oh,


>> unless
 they're
 posting
 screenshots
 from


a
 Bloomberg
 terminal,
 I
 wouldn't


freaking
 put
 any
 stock
 in
 it.


>> That's
 fair.
 That
 is
 very
 very
 fair.


Um,
 okay.
 So,
 I
 have
 the
 website
 open.


Yeah.
 Two
 minutes.
 We'll
 see.
 Marll


Steve,
 that's
 another
 one
 that
 could
 get


in
 today.


Marll's
 not
 in
 the
 S&P.


>> I
 I I
 couldn't
 believe
 it
 either.


>> Really?


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah,
 I
 could
 see
 I
 could
 see
 that


getting
 in.


>> I
 could
 see
 that
 getting
 in
 as
 well.


>> I
 could
 definitely
 see
 that.
 Okay.
 So,


in
 about
 a
 minute
 we
 will
 get
 it.
 514


and
 we'll
 we'll
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 the
 this


is
 the
 list
 of
 companies.
 Did
 I
 add


Marll
 here?
 No,
 I
 did
 not
 add
 Marll.


Let's
 add
 Marll.
 So,
 these
 are
 the


names.
 We'll
 see
 if
 there's
 any
 crazy


moves.
 We
 got
 it
 highlighted
 on
 SoFi,


but
 these
 are
 the
 ones


we
 are
 looking
 for.
 BMR
 is
 probably
 not


going
 to
 get
 into
 the
 SM.
 probably


not
 do
 that.


>> Come
 on.
 I
 don't
 I
 do
 not
 want
 BMR
 or


Micro
 Strategy
 in
 the
 S&P.
 Come
 on.


Let's
 not
 do
 that,


>> dude.
 We
 got
 to
 We
 got
 to
 crypto
 up
 the


American
 economy
 here.


>> We
 don't
 need
 them
 in
 the
 S&P.


>> Yeah.
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 it
 it
 does
 seem


very
 weird
 to
 put
 strategy
 in
 there.


Okay,
 here
 we
 go.
 5:15


we
 now
 wait.
 We
 should
 be
 getting
 an


update
 very
 soon.
 If
 we
 don't
 get
 an


update
 by
 5:30,
 there
 was
 no
 inclusion


for
 anything.
 Which
 would
 be
 the
 second


time
 in
 less
 than
 a
 year
 after
 three


years.


>> Oh,
 SoFi
 is
 going
 a
 little
 red
 now.
 All


these
 companies
 are
 turning
 red
 now.


That's
 so
 funny.


>> Wow.


>> Which
 is
 ridiculous.
 No,
 nobody
 should


have
 thought
 SoFi
 is
 getting
 in
 like
 it


should
 not
 go
 red
 off
 of
 those.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 just
 the


perception
 of
 it
 ends
 up


being
 a
 thing.


>> Um,


>> yeah,


>> Marvel's
 down
 2%
 on
 this
 news.
 Just


nothing
 yet.


>> Carvana,
 do
 they
 get
 in?


>> I
 think


>> Do
 not
 tell
 me
 freaking


>> hard
 vending
 machine
 is
 getting
 in.


That's
 ridiculous.


>> Just
 stop
 it.


Uh,


>> Carvana
 is
 still
 Evan,
 dude.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 try
 to
 confirm.
 Price


action
 isn't
 the
 only
 story,
 but
 let's


see.


>> It's
 a
 bunch
 of
 traders
 pumping
 it.


>> Usually
 an
 eight
 n%
 move
 though,
 that


tends
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 more
 signal.
 So,
 this


did
 happen
 last
 time
 though
 with
 Hood,


so
 I'm
 not
 calling
 anything
 yet.


>> That
 is
 true.
 That
 is
 true.


>> Um,


CR,
 what
 is
 this
 company?
 CR


uh
 they're
 up
 eight6%.
 Steve,
 you
 know


these
 guys?


>> I
 do
 not
 know
 them.
 No.


>> 80
 billion
 dollar
 business.


>> CR
 does
 um


company


>> uh
 CR
 plc.
 They're
 headquartered
 in


they're
 a
 building
 materials
 provider.


They're
 headquartered
 in
 Dublin.
 And


quite
 frankly,
 they
 might
 be
 doubling


their
 market
 cap
 over
 the
 next
 year
 if


they
 end
 up
 getting
 into
 the
 S&P
 500.


That's
 up
 4%.


after
 hours.


>> I'm
 still
 not
 seeing
 the
 official
 report


though.


>> No,
 me
 either.


>> Up.


>> Is
 Is
 Fix
 up?
 I
 think
 I
 I
 think
 I
 have


the
 report.
 I
 think
 Fix
 Are
 we
 up?


>> Fixes
 up.


>> Okay,
 so
 I
 This
 is
 not
 confirmed.
 I
 am


seeing
 CR,
 Carvana,
 and
 Comfort
 Systems.


This
 is
 not
 confirmed.


>> [ __ ]
 out
 of
 here.


>> It's
 starting
 to
 get
 No.
 All
 right.
 This


is
 the
 one
 that's
 going
 across.
 Yep.


This
 is
 This
 should
 be
 the
 one,
 folks.


CR,


Carvana,
 and
 Comfort
 Systems.
 Oh,
 I
 got


my
 my
 Bloomberg
 terminal
 that
 reported


it.
 There
 you
 go.


Seems
 like
 that's
 the
 one.


>> A
 card
 vending
 machine
 just
 got
 an
 S&P


500
 over
 Shener.
 Are
 you
 kidding
 me?


>> That
 is
 a
 bit
 weird.
 Also,


>> do
 me
 a
 favor.
 Do
 me
 a
 favor.
 What
 is


Shaneir's
 net
 income
 for
 the
 past
 three


months
 of
 what
 is
 Carbanas?


Okay.
 I
 I
 can't
 check
 that
 right
 now,


but
 I'm
 sure
 it's
 better
 than
 Carvana's


uh
 SoFi's
 dumping.


>> Come
 on.


>> But
 to
 be honest
 though,
 Steve,
 have
 you


looked
 at
 Carvana
 recently?


>> No,
 I
 haven't.


>> They
 have
 been
 growing
 like
 a
 weed


recently.
 Like
 there
 there
 was
 some
 um


obviously
 chapter
 11
 concerns
 and
 then


they
 really
 did
 see
 a
 comeback.


>> Okay.
 And
 Tanner,
 what's
 their


profitability
 over
 the
 past
 three


months?


>> Uh
 263
 million.


What's
 LG's


>> billion?


>> What
 is
 it?


>> He
 was
 not
 expecting
 me
 to
 say
 that.


>> What
 is
 it?


>> 1.6
 billion.


>> Oh,
 cool.
 So,
 we
 let
 Yeah,
 cool.
 Cool


story.


>> Okay,
 but
 that's
 not
 the
 only
 thing,


Steve.
 Like,
 yeah,
 we
 look
 at
 other


things,
 but


>> dude,
 Carvana
 CR,
 which
 that
 came
 out
 of


left
 field.
 Fix
 we
 talked
 about,
 so
 we


did
 discuss
 that.
 And
 Carvana.
 So
 they


they
 they
 said
 no
 to
 Alab,
 Verdive,


Vivve,
 Micro
 Strategy,
 Marll,
 Reddit,


Shener,
 and
 so
 forth.


>> I
 just
 look
 the
 whole
 thing
 seems


ridiculous
 that
 Shaneer
 is
 not.


I
 don't
 even
 own
 Shaneer,
 so
 I
 don't


benefit
 by
 saying
 that,
 but
 when
 you


look
 at
 quality
 companies,
 Shaneer
 is


the
 highest
 quality
 company
 out
 of
 all


those
 names.


>> Yeah,
 it
 is
 confirmed.
 They'll
 be
 in
 on


uh
 December
 20th,
 folks.
 December
 20th.


CR,
 Carvana,
 and
 Comfort
 Systems.


>> Great.


>> Is
 it
 crazy
 for
 me
 to
 say
 though,
 I
 like


how
 many
 names
 were
 entered?
 I
 think
 it


does
 take
 out
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 names
 that


were
 before
 SoFi.
 So,
 we
 got
 to
 trim
 the


the
 the
 bigger
 companies
 have
 to
 go


before
 SoFi
 gets
 in.


>> No,
 I
 think
 that's
 fair.
 I
 think
 that's


a
 fair
 point.


>> All
 right,
 that's
 it.
 That's


>> Yeah,
 which
 companies
 are
 out?
 Which


companies
 are
 out?
 Oh
 yeah.
 Which
 ones


are
 out?
 Oh,
 Elk,
 KQ,
 Solstice,
 Advanced


Materials,
 and
 Mohawk
 Industries.


>> But
 this
 is
 what
 I
 mean,
 though.
 Like,


like,
 should
 SoFi
 be
 in
 there
 before
 any


of
 these
 names?
 Of
 course.
 Like,


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 names
 that
 need
 to
 go.


Solstice
 is
 down
 2%
 on
 the
 year.
 I
 don't


know
 what
 LKQ
 is.
 That
 stock
 is
 down
 18%


for
 the
 year.
 What's
 the
 market
 cap
 on


these
 names?


>> LKQ
 is
 7
 billion.
 Uh,
 Solstice
 is,


sorry,
 Solstice
 is
 7
 billion.
 L
 Well,


no,
 LKQ
 is
 also
 7
 billion.
 And
 then


Mohawk
 Industries


is


>> Isn't
 that
 freaking
 rug
 company?


>> Yes,
 that
 is
 a
 rug
 company.


>> I'm
 just
 saying,
 isn't
 it?


>> Yes.
 And
 it's
 a
 another
 seven
 billion


dollar
 company.


>> This
 is
 what
 I
 mean.
 There's
 so
 many


names
 that
 are
 not
 even
 eligible


anymore.


Oh,
 wow.
 Yeah.
 All
 of
 you
 got
 to
 be
 21


billion
 to
 get
 in,
 right?
 So
 all
 these


>> It's
 I
 think
 it's
 over
 23
 now.


>> Yeah.
 I'm
 I'm
 seriously
 I
 think
 like


something
 like
 it's
 almost
 200
 names
 are


not
 even
 eligible
 anymore
 because


they've
 fallen
 out
 of
 profitability.


They
 don't
 have
 enough
 volume
 or
 they


have
 less
 than
 a$20
 billion
 market
 cap.


It
 is
 very


>> I'm
 sorry
 for
 everybody
 who
 wanted
 a
 a


juicy
 S&P
 today.
 I
 mean,
 these
 are


relatively
 boring
 names,
 but
 it
 is
 what


it
 is.
 At least
 Carvana,
 I
 know,
 is
 a


bigger
 retail
 name,
 and
 at
 least
 that


one
 got
 to
 move.


>> I'll
 go
 for
 a
 drive
 next
 time,
 guys.
 I'm


sorry.
 I
 uh


>> Yeah,
 we
 can
 blame
 Tanner.
 We
 can
 blame


Tanner
 on
 this.


>> Tanner,
 don't
 even
 bother
 showing
 up


tonight.
 We're
 good.


All
 right.


>> Go
 ahead,
 Denn.


>> I
 was
 just
 going
 to
 say
 that's
 it
 for


me.
 Um
 that's
 why
 I
 didn't
 want
 to


stream
