immigrants.


>> They're
 criminals.
 That
 country
 is
 no


good
 for
 a
 reason.


>> Hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 people
 mass


migration.


>> According
 to
 the
 American
 government,


Europe
 faces
 the
 real
 and
 stark
 prospect


of
 civilizational
 eras.
 The
 main
 reason


American
 leaders
 like
 Marco
 Rubio
 and
 JD


Vance
 are
 quite
 clear.
 So
 look,
 the
 the


greatest
 threat
 in
 Europe
 is
 that
 you've


had
 the
 leaders
 of
 the
 West
 decide
 that


they
 should
 send
 millions
 and
 millions


of
 unvetted
 foreign
 migrants
 into
 their


countries.
 That
 is
 the
 biggest
 threat
 to


Europe.
 We
 opened
 our
 doors
 to
 an


unprecedented
 wave
 of
 mass
 migration


that
 threatens
 the
 cohesion
 of
 our


societies,
 the
 continuity
 of
 our


culture.
 This
 of
 course
 refers
 to
 the


wave
 of
 mass
 migration
 in
 2015
 and
 2016


when
 Germany's
 Angla
 Merkel
 famously


said,
 "We're
 shuffandas.
 We
 can
 do
 it."


An
 act
 of
 kindness
 indeed.
 But
 now
 10


years
 later,
 was
 Merkel
 too
 naive?


According
 to
 Trump
 at
 the
 United
 Nations


last
 year,
 these
 immigrants,


>> they
 repaid
 kindness
 with
 crime.
 Even
 in


>> and
 in
 Switzerland,
 beautiful


Switzerland,
 72%
 of
 the
 people
 in


prisons
 are
 from
 outside
 of
 Switzerland.


>> Elon
 Musk
 himself
 has
 described
 European


immigration
 as
 an
 invasion
 and
 agreed


with
 Dr.
 Ellis
 Vital
 from
 Germany's
 AFD


party
 that


>> they
 let
 like
 millions
 of
 people
 in.


They
 let
 um
 um
 do
 let
 them
 do
 crimes
 on


our
 streets
 like
 the
 crime
 rate
 are


skyrocketing.


>> But
 is
 it
 really
 true?
 Has
 Europe
 become


less
 safe
 as
 a
 result
 of
 mass
 migration


largely
 from
 outside
 of
 Europe?
 This
 is


such
 a
 politicized
 subject
 that
 it's


incredibly
 difficult
 for
 people
 who
 just


want
 to
 know
 what's
 actually
 going
 on
 to


find
 an
 unbiased
 analysis.
 Right-wing


politicians
 have
 even
 accused
 academics


of
 a
 left-wing
 bias
 on
 this
 particular


subject.
 Therefore,
 we
 spent
 weeks


reading
 hundreds
 of
 studies
 trying
 to


find
 out
 if
 either
 right-wing


politicians
 are
 cherry-picking
 data
 or


if
 academics
 and
 activists
 are
 leaving


out
 convenient
 facts.
 In
 this
 process,


we
 spoke
 to
 Bonei
 professor
 Paulo
 Pinati


who
 has
 spent
 much
 of
 his
 career


analyzing
 this
 issue
 from
 a
 datadriven


perspective
 and
 is
 not
 afraid
 to
 point


out
 problems
 like


>> they
 don't
 get
 a
 job,
 the
 visa
 expires,


maybe
 they
 don't
 have
 the
 money
 to
 go


back
 to
 their
 own
 country
 and
 so
 they


remain
 in
 the
 country
 and
 that's
 kind
 of


if
 you
 want
 the
 perfect
 receipt
 for


disaster,
 right?


>> That's
 right.
 There
 are
 no
 taboos
 here


at
 Money
 and
 Micro.
 We
 just
 want
 to
 know


what's
 going
 on.
 But
 we
 are
 also
 not


afraid
 to
 call
 out
 exaggerations
 such
 as


the
 IFD's
 claim
 that
 crime
 rates
 are


skyrocketing.
 Since
 the
 1990s,
 the


homicide
 rate
 in
 Europe
 went
 down,
 36%


in
 Germany,
 50%
 in
 Spain,
 15
 in
 France,


4%
 in
 the
 UK,
 and
 an
 astonishing
 82%
 in


Italy.
 And
 what
 makes
 this
 even
 more


strikingly
 is
 that
 this
 decline
 in


deadly
 violence
 happened
 during
 the
 same


period
 Europe
 experienced
 unprecedented


migration
 with
 millions
 arriving
 from


Eastern
 Europe,
 Africa,
 and
 the
 Middle


East.
 But
 if
 that
 is
 true,
 then
 why
 are


immigrants
 so
 over
 represented
 in


European
 prisons?
 Something
 strange
 is


going
 on
 here.
 Is
 Europe
 genuinely


facing
 civilizational
 erasure?
 And
 are


European
 prisons
 full
 of
 immigrants?


Clear
 evidence
 of
 that?
 Here
 is
 the


truth
 about
 Europe's
 mass
 migration


experience.
 Okay,
 to
 truly
 understand


the
 impact
 of
 migration
 has
 had
 on


Europe,
 we
 need
 to
 go
 back
 in
 time.


Europe
 has
 essentially
 seen
 five
 big


migration
 waves.
 The
 first
 wave
 was
 the


so-called
 guest
 worker
 wave
 that
 was


driven
 by
 the
 need
 for
 labor
 in
 Western


Europe's
 fast
 growing
 economies.
 First,


there
 were
 Italians,
 Spanish,
 and
 Greek


migrants.
 And
 then
 when
 those
 economies


started
 growing
 quickly
 themselves,


Western
 Europe
 started
 attracting


lowskilled
 workers
 from
 Turkey,
 Morocco,


and
 Yugoslavia.
 This
 program
 stopped


after
 the
 oil
 crisis
 of
 the
 1970s
 when


many
 jobs
 disappeared.
 But
 many
 guest


workers
 stayed
 and
 on
 top
 of
 that,


migration
 continued
 for
 a
 while
 as
 guest


workers
 brought
 their
 families
 to


Europe.
 The
 second
 wave
 was
 tied
 to


decolonization
 from
 the
 1950s
 to
 1980s.


And
 during
 this
 wave,
 many
 refugees
 from


newly
 independent
 colonies
 migrated
 to


their
 former
 colonial
 masters.
 This
 wave


was
 possible
 because
 during
 this
 area,


many
 colonial
 subjects
 were
 technically


nationals.
 And
 since
 they
 often
 already


spoke
 the
 language,
 it
 was
 relatively


easy
 for
 them
 to
 move.
 This
 is
 why
 today


there
 are
 still
 many
 Indonesian


descendants
 in
 the
 Netherlands,


Algerians
 and
 Africans
 in
 France,
 and


Indians
 and
 Pakistanis
 in
 the
 UK.
 Third,


after
 the
 fall
 of
 the
 Iron
 Curtain,


there
 was
 a
 massive
 migration
 wave
 from


East
 to
 Western
 Europe.
 And
 fourth,
 in


2015
 and
 2016,
 there
 was
 a
 mass


migration
 wave
 from
 Syria,
 North
 Africa,


and
 Afghanistan
 to
 Europe.
 And
 finally,


in
 the
 last
 few
 years,
 millions
 of


Ukrainians
 migrated
 to
 Europe.
 Each
 of


these
 migration
 waves
 had
 their
 own


political
 backlashes.
 But
 do
 people
 like


Trump
 and
 JD
 Vans
 refer
 to
 Eastern


Europeans
 moving
 to
 Western
 Europe
 when


they
 talk
 about
 civilizational
 eraser?


I
 think
 this
 clip
 from
 conservative
 news


channel
 Newsmax
 makes
 it
 quite
 clear


what
 they
 really
 care
 about.


>> 50
 million
 Muslims
 now
 live
 in
 Europe.


At
 the
 turn
 of
 the
 century,
 that
 number


was
 less
 than
 500,000.
 as
 the
 people
 who


lead
 these
 countries
 try
 to
 do
 what
 Joe


Biden
 tried
 to
 do
 here
 and
 that
 is


fundamentally
 change
 the
 racial
 and


ethnic
 makeup
 of
 a
 nation
 and
 make
 white


Christians
 a
 minority
 in
 their
 own


country
 as
 the
 attack
 on
 western


civilization
 continues.
 Everyone
 who


lives
 in
 Europe
 knows
 that
 there
 are


many
 different
 cultures
 inside
 Europe.


American
 culture
 is
 also
 quite
 different


from
 European
 culture.
 If
 we
 want
 to
 see


how
 different
 then
 political
 scientists


Inglehart
 and
 Welser
 have
 given
 us
 this


map
 where
 you
 can
 see
 Protestant
 Europe,


Catholic
 Europe,
 Orthodox
 Europe
 and
 the


English-speaking
 world
 these
 cultures


are
 distinct
 but
 quite
 close
 to
 each


other.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 African


Islamic
 cultures
 are
 very
 different
 from


most
 European
 cultures.
 And
 look,


sharing
 spaces
 with
 people
 who
 are


culturally
 distant
 presents
 challenges.


Should
 public
 schools
 have
 halal
 meals?


Should
 burkas
 be
 allowed
 in
 public


institutions?
 These
 are
 valid
 debates
 to


have.
 However,
 the
 problem
 with
 using


language
 like
 civilizational
 erasure
 or


about
 white
 Christian
 descendants


becoming
 a
 minority
 is
 that
 this
 is
 just


complete
 and
 utter
 excuse
 my
 language


bull.
 Take
 the
 newsmax
 segment.
 While
 50


million
 Muslims
 sounds
 like
 a
 scary
 big


number,
 this
 includes
 Balcon
 countries


and
 Russian
 republics
 that
 have


historically
 been
 Muslim.
 More


outrageously,
 the
 claim
 that
 there
 were


less
 than
 500,000
 Muslims
 in
 Europe
 at


the
 turn
 of
 the
 century
 is
 just
 wrong.


As
 you
 can
 see
 here,
 in
 the
 year
 2000,


there
 were
 about
 37
 million
 Muslims
 in


Europe.
 And
 in
 2020,
 that
 was
 about
 45


million.
 To
 put
 that
 into
 perspective,


in
 this
 period,
 the
 share
 of
 Muslims
 in


Europe
 has
 been
 rising
 slowly
 from
 about


4%
 of
 all
 Europeans
 to
 6%.
 However,
 if


we
 take
 into
 account
 that
 migration
 to


Europe
 is
 still
 happening
 and
 that


Muslims
 tend
 to
 have
 more
 children
 than


native
 Europeans,
 we
 do
 have
 some


credible
 estimates
 that
 in
 25
 years
 from


now,
 in
 2050,
 the
 share
 of
 Muslims
 in


many
 Western
 European
 countries
 will
 get


close
 to
 or
 above
 15%.


That
 is
 quite
 a
 big
 increase
 from
 the
 6


to
 8%
 that
 we
 are
 seeing
 in
 many
 Western


European
 countries
 today.
 But
 again,


just
 to
 put
 these
 numbers
 into


perspective
 for
 our
 American
 viewers,


the
 number
 of
 black
 people
 in
 America


today
 is
 about
 15%.
 Saying
 that
 Europe


faces
 civilizational
 erasure
 due
 to


Muslim
 migration
 is
 like
 saying
 that


America
 today
 is
 a
 dominantly
 African


country.
 It
 is
 just
 complete
 and
 utter


nonsense.
 But
 of
 course,
 if
 you
 go
 to


certain
 cities
 in
 Europe
 or
 especially


certain
 neighborhoods
 in
 Europe,
 it
 can


feel
 very
 different.
 For
 example,
 in


Brussels
 about
 28%
 of
 inhabitants
 are


Muslim
 or
 in
 the
 poor
 Brussels


neighborhood
 of
 Anderle
 where
 my


colleague
 Alejandro
 lives
 about
 30%
 of


inhabitants
 are
 Muslims.
 So
 of
 course


the
 rapid
 transformation
 of
 certain


cities
 and
 neighborhoods
 has
 led
 to


cultural
 tensions
 there.
 In
 fact,


besides
 increased
 economic
 inequality


and
 economic
 stagnation,
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 research
 that
 convincingly
 shows
 that


increased
 low-skilled
 migration
 from


non-European
 countries
 is
 a
 crucial


factor
 needed
 to
 explain
 the
 rise
 of


far-right
 parties
 in
 Europe.
 And
 much


like
 Vines
 and
 Trump,
 farright
 European


politicians
 like
 Hungary's
 Victor
 Orbin


often
 tell
 us
 that
 if
 you
 take
 masses
 of


non-registered
 immigrants
 from
 the


Middle
 East
 into
 your
 country,
 you
 are


importing
 terrorism,
 crime,


anti-semitism,
 and
 homophobia.
 So
 even


though
 migrants
 and
 their
 descendants


remain
 a
 minority
 in
 Europe,
 could
 it


still
 be
 true
 that
 immigrants
 are
 making


Europe
 far
 less
 safe?
 This
 is
 where
 we


get
 back
 to
 Trump's
 UN
 speech.
 And
 in


Switzerland,
 beautiful
 Switzerland,
 72%


of
 the
 people
 in
 prisons
 are
 from


outside
 of
 Switzerland.


>> First,
 Trump
 is
 not
 wrong.
 Immigrants


are
 over
 represented
 in
 European


prisons.
 But
 as
 you
 can
 see
 here,


Switzerland
 is
 an
 extreme
 case.
 In
 this


speech,
 Trump
 does
 not
 mention
 that
 in


some
 striking
 cases,
 like
 in
 the
 case
 of


the
 UK,
 immigrants
 are
 actually
 under


represented
 in
 prison,
 just
 as
 they
 are


in
 other
 Anglo-Saxon
 countries
 like


Australia,
 New
 Zealand,
 and
 the
 United


States.
 So,
 what's
 going
 on?
 First,
 as


you
 can
 see
 here,
 Anglo-Saxon
 countries


tend
 to
 attract
 much
 more
 highly


educated
 migrants.
 these
 are
 more
 likely


to
 find
 a
 high-paying
 job
 and
 therefore


less
 likely
 to
 commit
 crimes
 and
 end
 up


in
 jail.
 The
 fact
 that
 continental


European
 prisons
 have
 a
 lot
 of


immigrants
 is
 probably
 because
 Europe's


immigrants
 are
 simply
 poorer
 than
 the


average
 European.
 It
 does
 not


necessarily
 have
 anything
 to
 do
 with


their
 cultural
 background.
 A
 second


powerful
 explanation
 is
 that
 Europeans


are
 pretty
 old
 and
 immigrants
 are
 on


average
 much
 younger.
 younger
 people


commit
 more
 crimes.
 So
 again,
 this
 could


disprove
 the
 narrative
 that
 the
 type
 of


immigration
 matters.
 Finally,
 being
 in


jail
 more
 could
 be
 because
 immigrants


commit
 more
 crimes.
 But
 there's
 also


credible
 research
 which
 shows
 that


immigrants
 are
 more
 likely
 to
 be
 held
 in


jail
 while
 waiting
 for
 the
 trial
 because


judges
 often
 believe
 they
 are
 a
 higher


flight
 risk
 than
 locals,
 which
 makes


sense,
 I
 guess.
 but
 that
 does
 put
 them


in
 a
 worse
 situation
 for
 negotiating


deals,
 especially
 if
 they're
 not
 fluent


in
 a
 European
 language.
 That
 being
 said,


nobody
 knows
 for
 sure
 how
 big
 these


three
 effects
 are.
 So,
 all
 of
 this


research
 neither
 proves
 that
 immigrants


are
 innocent,
 but
 it
 also
 does
 not
 prove


that
 they
 are
 guilty
 of
 committing
 more


crimes.
 But,
 okay,
 that
 means
 that
 Trump


and
 Orban
 could
 still
 be
 right.
 Migrants


could
 make
 Europe
 much
 less
 safe.
 We


just
 need
 more
 evidence.
 So
 what
 about


the
 AFD
 claim
 that


>> the
 crime
 rate
 are
 skyrocketing


>> because
 of
 immigrants?
 Well,
 in
 most
 of


Europe,
 we
 actually
 see
 the
 opposite.


Crime
 is
 falling.
 For
 example,
 as
 you


can
 see
 here,
 violent
 crimes
 like


murders
 kept
 on
 dropping
 even
 as
 the


number
 of
 migrants
 in
 Europe
 increased.


Similarly,
 petty
 crime
 like
 robbery,


burglaries,
 and
 theft
 have
 dropped
 in


Europe
 in
 the
 same
 years
 that


immigration
 increased.
 This
 is
 also
 true


in
 Germany.
 However,
 here
 we
 do
 see
 a


suspicious
 increase
 in
 crime
 after
 the


massive
 2015
 migration
 wave.
 Crucially,


these
 studies
 do
 not
 distinguish
 between


the
 background
 of
 migrants
 though.
 So


perhaps
 the
 AFD
 is
 right
 about


increasing
 crime
 because
 of
 the
 massive


2015
 2016
 Muslim
 migration
 wave
 in


Germany.
 And
 perhaps
 even
 for
 the
 rest


of
 Europe,
 crime
 could
 have
 fallen
 even


faster
 if
 it
 wasn't
 for
 all
 these
 new


immigrants.
 to
 separate
 the
 effect
 of


migrants
 from
 broader
 effects
 that
 are


decreasing
 crime
 overall,
 like
 Europeans


getting
 older
 and
 better
 home
 and
 store


security
 systems.
 Researchers
 have
 done


several
 detailed
 studies
 about
 the


relationship
 between
 crime
 and
 migration


in
 the
 US,
 Italy,
 and
 Germany.
 They
 take


into
 account
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 factors


such
 as
 GDP
 and
 youth.
 And
 surprisingly


>> in
 general
 the
 the
 conclusion
 is
 that


these
 increases
 in
 migration
 sometimes


very
 huge
 increase
 in
 migration
 they


have
 no
 significant
 effect
 on
 crime


rates.


>> For
 example,
 as
 you
 can
 see
 here
 while


most
 migrants
 came
 to
 East
 Germany


between
 2008
 and
 2019,
 crime
 has
 mostly


gone
 up
 in
 the
 west
 and
 south
 of


Germany.
 But
 if
 migrants
 do
 not
 clearly


increase
 overall
 crime
 even
 in
 places


like
 Germany
 and
 Italy,
 how
 can


low-skilled
 migrants
 be
 so
 over


represented
 in
 prisons?
 When
 we
 asked


Professor
 Pinati
 about
 this,
 he
 offered


another
 explanation.
 Immigrants
 may
 be


replacing
 nativeborn
 offenders
 in
 some


types
 of
 criminal
 activity.


>> So
 think
 about
 the
 drug
 sector,
 drug


trafficking,
 which
 is
 a
 major
 criminal


enterprise
 in
 most
 cases,
 right?
 So
 if


you
 were
 trying
 to
 buy
 drugs


20
 years
 ago,
 the
 dealer
 probably
 was


going
 to
 be
 a
 native,
 right?
 Um
 if
 you


buy
 drugs
 nowadays,


uh
 the
 dealer
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 member
 of


some
 foreign
 criminal
 group,
 right?
 But


in
 the
 end,
 the
 amount
 of
 drugs
 that
 is


sold
 in
 the
 street
 is
 still
 going
 to
 be


the
 same.
 It
 depends
 more
 on
 other
 it


depends
 more
 on
 the
 demand
 for
 drugs.
 In


other
 words,
 and
 honestly,
 this
 is


something
 I
 absolutely
 did
 not
 expect


when
 starting
 the
 research
 for
 this


video,
 it
 is
 possible
 that
 yes,


immigrants
 commit
 more
 crimes
 than


native
 people.
 And
 yet,
 they
 do
 not


increase
 crime
 overall.
 Just
 like


immigrants
 may
 take
 low-skilled
 jobs


like
 fruit
 picking
 from
 native


Europeans,
 they
 may
 actually
 also
 simply


take
 crime
 jobs
 from
 native
 Europeans
 as


well.
 So
 for
 instance,
 what
 we
 observe


in
 these
 very
 large
 criminal
 uh
 networks


involving
 drug
 trafficking
 is
 that
 the


natives
 they
 are
 still
 part
 of
 the


networks
 but
 they
 climb
 up
 to
 the
 higher


levels
 of
 the
 organization
 while
 the


lower
 level
 like
 the
 retail
 seller
 in


the
 street


the
 drug
 dealer
 in
 the
 street
 is
 going


to
 be
 an
 immigrant
 different
 from
 20


years
 ago.
 Still,
 I
 have
 to
 be
 honest.


We
 don't
 have
 enough
 data
 to
 completely,


without
 a
 doubt,
 confirm
 that
 this
 is


what
 happened.
 But
 it
 could
 explain
 why


even
 in
 detailed
 studies,
 big
 migration


waves
 do
 not
 seem
 to
 lead
 to
 more
 crime,


but
 they
 could
 lead
 to
 a
 higher
 number


of
 criminals
 in
 jail
 that
 are


immigrants.
 So,
 okay,
 there
 you
 have
 it.


The
 evidence
 is
 actually
 pretty
 clear.


Conclusion.
 Even
 for
 extremely
 detailed


recent
 studies,


>> the
 conclusion
 is
 that
 these
 increases


in
 migration,
 sometimes
 very
 huge


increase
 in
 migration,
 they
 have
 no


significant
 effect
 on
 crime
 rates.
 So


no,
 Europe
 is
 not
 at
 risk
 of


civilizational
 erasure.
 And
 even
 recent


migration
 waves
 have
 not
 caused
 crime
 to


skyrocket.
 That's
 right.
 Here
 I
 am,
 an


ex-academic
 in
 his
 ivory
 tower
 telling


ordinary
 people,
 "Move
 along,
 folks.


There's
 nothing
 to
 see
 here.
 Research


says
 immigration
 is
 fine.
 You
 should


just
 open
 your
 borders
 and
 let
 the


immigrants
 come."
 If
 that
 is
 making
 you


feel
 unsafe
 or
 uneasy,
 well,
 you
 are


wrong.
 No.
 Just
 because
 the
 truth
 is
 not


on
 one
 extreme
 does
 not
 mean
 that
 the


truth
 is
 on
 the
 other
 extreme.


Immigrants
 from
 distant
 cultures
 always


cause
 tensions.
 But
 one
 key
 factor
 that


often
 gets
 overlooked
 is
 access
 to
 jobs.


If
 asylum
 seekers
 and
 migrants
 are
 not


allowed
 to
 work
 legally,
 they
 can
 end
 up


stuck.
 Their
 visa
 might
 expire.
 They


might
 not
 have
 money
 to
 return
 home.
 And


without
 access
 to
 regular
 jobs,
 yeah,


some
 may
 turn
 to
 illegal
 ways
 of
 making


money
 like
 drug
 dealing
 or
 burglary.
 The


work
 that
 professor
 pinati
 has
 shown


that
 when
 immigrants


uh
 receive
 legal
 status,
 they
 are


finally
 able
 to
 obtain
 legal
 status
 and


therefore
 the
 right
 to
 work
 in
 the


official
 economy,
 the
 probability
 of


committing
 crimes
 decreases
 by
 50%.
 It's


cut
 by
 half.
 Right?
 So
 the
 takeaway


should
 be
 that
 if
 you
 do
 want
 to
 have


some
 migration,
 it's
 essential
 to
 do
 it


orderly.
 This
 can
 also
 explain
 that
 a


recent
 study
 did
 find
 that
 one
 year


after
 the
 relatively
 chaotic
 2015-16


migration
 wave,
 there
 was
 actually
 a


significant
 wave
 of
 increased
 burglaries


and
 theft
 in
 Germany.
 So
 there
 was
 some


truth
 to
 what
 the
 AFD
 politicians
 said


to
 Elon
 Musk.
 Another
 thing
 is
 that
 you


want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 migrants
 and


their
 children
 are
 able
 to
 integrate


into
 society
 and
 that
 they
 do
 not
 all


end
 up
 in
 some
 isolated
 ghettos
 such
 as


the
 French
 ban
 or
 in
 Brussels
 suburbs


like
 Ander.
 On
 top
 of
 that,
 one
 major


limitation
 of
 the
 research
 that
 we've


discussed
 today
 is
 that
 it
 looks
 at


migrants
 but
 not
 at
 their
 children.


Recent
 research
 shows
 that
 in
 countries


like
 Austria,
 the
 Netherlands,
 France,


and
 Denmark,
 children
 of
 immigrants
 from


the
 first
 two
 waves
 often
 have
 a
 harder


time
 moving
 up
 in
 life
 compared
 to


children
 of
 native
 parents
 who
 grew
 up


with
 the
 same
 level
 of
 poverty.


This
 may
 actually
 help
 explain
 why


second
 generation
 immigrants
 in,
 for


example,
 Denmark
 are
 actually
 more


likely
 to
 end
 up
 in
 prison
 than
 both


their
 parents,
 on
 the
 one
 hand,


migrants,
 and
 native
 Danish
 children.


Finally,
 we
 should
 be
 open
 to
 the


possibility
 that
 men
 from
 countries
 with


more
 traditional
 attitudes
 toward
 women


are
 on
 average
 more
 likely
 to
 engage
 in


sexual
 violence.
 This
 should
 not
 be


entirely
 surprising
 since
 we
 know
 that


men
 with
 sexist
 attitudes
 are
 more


likely
 to
 commit
 violence
 against
 women.


Worryingly,
 a
 recent
 study
 from
 Lund


University
 found
 that
 63%
 of
 those


convicted
 of
 rape
 in
 Sweden
 have
 an


immigration
 background.
 This
 massive


over
 representation
 decreased
 a
 bit


after
 controlling
 for
 soio
 economic


factors
 and
 for
 substance
 abuse
 and


mental
 health
 conditions,
 but
 it
 did
 not


disappear
 completely.
 So
 yeah,
 even
 if


migration
 has
 not
 clearly
 made
 Europe


less
 safe
 overall,
 there
 are
 still
 real


serious
 problems
 that
 need
 to
 be
 studied


and
 more
 importantly
 fixed.
 However,


these
 problems
 are
 clearly
 not
 big


enough
 that
 it
 is
 something
 that
 Donald


Trump
 should
 be
 worried
 about.
 Talking


about
 sex
 offenders,
 perhaps
 he
 should


worry
 a
 bit
 more
 about
 the
 fact
 that
 his


government
 is
 actively
 protecting
 the


associates
 of
 a
 convicted
 pedophile
 and


that
 Trump
 and
 his
 friends
 are
 over


represented
 in
 the
 Epstein
 files.
 Maybe


it's
 a
 bit
 much
 to
 call
 that


civilizational
 erasure,
 but
 it
 does
 look


a
 lot
 like
 civilizational
 decline
 all


the
 way
 from
 here
 in
 Europe.
 But
 yeah,


that's
 my
 take.

 less
 innovative.
