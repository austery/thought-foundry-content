Hey there, all thoughts viewers,
you are about to watch a conversation
recorded
live in Chicago with TRW founder and CEO
Don Wilson, sometimes
called the smartest man in trading.
We had an absolute blast hosting that show
and we hope
you enjoy it too.
Don, well, thank you for being here.
Really appreciate it.
Great to be here. Truly the perfect guest.
Truly the perfect guest
about what's next in trading.
But just to begin with, why GPUs?
Well,
obviously
AI is becoming more and more useful.
And, as it becomes more useful, people,
use more of it, which means they need
to use more GPUs to,
to run inference or train new models.
And I actually have this theory
that within the next ten years,
the world will spend more per year on on
GPUs than it does on crude oil.
And that would, of course, make GPUs compute the largest commodity in the world.
So it
seems like you would kind of need a market
for a very modest call,
just the largest market in the world.
Yeah.
It's funny because, you know,
I certainly an oil often coming out of,
you know, sandy desert,
but now they're literally turning the sand
via, chips into the commodity itself, or,
like, breathing life into the sand.
Just to back up,
I have a million questions about that.
About this.
For those who don't know,
why don't you give us the sort of,
you know, the 32nd or the 45
second description of,
what you do or what AWS.
Yeah. So,
I started off
standing in the trading pit in Chicago
and the Eurodollar option pit,
yelling and screaming and, and,
then I would go home and write code
on my Macintosh computer,
and I built models and essentially,
you know, I don't stand in the pit
and yell and scream anymore,
and most of the pits are gone,
but but we kind of
do the same thing now with computers.
I heard a story that you were
once on vacation with your family,
and you were in Italy.
I think in Florence.
And instead of, I don't know,
eating gelato or something like that,
you decided to invent a new Greek letter
for derivatives trading.
So. So this is cool.
Yeah. So?
So here, I mean, the
the you're confusing two story, so.
Oh. Dairy.
Okay.
Actually, what happened was,
I was,
there was a new exchange
that had launched an interest rate swap
futures contract.
It was called IBC. And,
I looked at the contract
and I figured out that
actually they had not designed
the contracts properly.
And so,
although they were telling everybody
that it was economically equivalent
to a regular interest rate swap, it wasn't
because it had this additional
convexity bias in it.
Which is we could talk about convexity
bias.
It goes even more in the weeds
than a lot of your podcast go into.
But, but so when I was in Florence,
I had this idea of how you could create
an interest rate swap futures contract
without this convexity bias problem.
And that is
that is what I focused my time on there.
What was the letter.
Well so so back to the letter
that the letter
that was about
after a really unpleasant
period in the Eurodollar option pit,
where, you know, all the market makers
lost tons of money because the shape
of the skew shifted dramatically.
As the fed started hiking
in a very predictable manner. And,
and nobody had really developed
a measure for, linear skew,
and so over, over the weekend,
I said, you know, during the week,
I said, well,
you know, this isn't that much fun.
We're losing a lot of money every day.
But the good news is that
that means we have something to learn.
And so,
so I spent the weekend working
with the quants and we came up with,
you know, kind of a measure of, of the,
linear skew between the inputs and
decided to use
the Greek letter psi to describe it.
And, you know,
so by Monday morning,
we had put it into the risk and
under the sheets and, and before the open,
I explained to the traders,
you know, how to talk about it,
how to use language around it.
And, and before you know, it,
we had made the money back
because we were able to trade, manage
this risk better than anybody else
because we had a whole language around it.
Amazing.
So we've established your street cred
when it comes to,
solving problems in contracts
for financial instruments.
If I think about a GPU future
or something like that,
the first problem that comes to
my mind is standardization.
Because of course, you know,
all different types of chips,
different types of memory,
different latency, I guess.
How do you go about addressing that?
So so that's a great question.
And right now, so what we've done is
we set up to two companies.
One is called compute exchange,
not very creatively named.
We have a tendency to do that.
At what is your initials. Right.
That was my trading badge.
And yes, also my initials. Yeah.
I, you know,
I mean,
we did better later on with Cumberland.
Crypto. Yeah. That's nice, that's nice.
That was actually a reference
to the Grateful Dead song
about, Cumberland Mines.
I didn't I didn't know that either. Yeah.
One of my partners who does the more
creative naming came up with that one.
He's a he's a dead fan.
Anyway, so,
the other company is called Silicon data.
And silicon data is job is to
create indices that will be,
that will become tradable,
you know, will be viable to have futures
contracts listed on them.
And right now,
they've created
a number of different ones, but
one is the H100 index,
another one is the A100 index.
And believe it or not, those indices
are both available on Bloomberg.
Oh, amazing. That's, love hearing that.
If we were in the studio,
I would already we would be looking at
I would already be looking up the, chart
as you were talking about it.
Who are the natural participants?
Because when I think about AI or training,
you know, imagine
someone goes to one of the big cloud
vendors and they sign a long term contract
or whatever.
Who are the participants
who would be better off in an environment
where there was sort of where
there was a liquid market for compute. So,
what we found and
who actually uses, compute,
extend source compute.
And we find that because
there are something like 70 different
cloud providers
that, participate, you can,
you can often get better pricing.
And one of the things that you can do is
you can specify
if, let's say that you're an AI company.
Yeah.
And you kind of you know, roughly
what kind of cluster you want,
you can specify that.
You can even say, you know what?
I'm, I don't I'm indifferent
between locations
or, you know, I
if it's in the Middle East,
I'm still okay with it,
but I want to pay $0.20 per GPU or less.
Whatever it is, you can kind of express
your preference curve.
Compute exchange can conduct an auction
and then, you know, find the,
the kind of best price compute
that matches your needs.
So that's,
that's kind of the idea of how it works.
And, and,
you know, it probably doesn't work
if you want a 10,000 cluster.
You know, monster
for doing a huge training run.
Okay.
But for, for inference, it works great.
Or for smaller training runs,
it works really well.
Is the broader impact
the idea that once you establish
a liquid market where people can,
you know,
presumably hedge their exposure, that
that would bring down the cost of capital.
So, so that's right.
So, so once you have a liquid market,
then it's much easier.
Then then you have much more confidence
in the indices.
And you can then list futures contracts.
And and so what does that do.
It enables the NIO clouds
that are going out
raising capital, buying a bunch of GPUs,
putting them in data centers
and kind of hoping
that they can rent them out
and not really knowing what,
the they're going to be able
to rent them out for six months from now,
let alone two years from now.
So a Nio cloud could,
buy the GPUs, sell
a strip of futures contracts,
and I envision that these will be traded
kind of like electricity futures,
where there's one for every month. And.
And if you want to hedge
the next three years, you sell 36 of them.
And now you've locked in your pricing,
obviously their cost of capital
is going to go down,
which in turn should make GPUs
more readily available.
And then on the flip side,
if your running an AI company
and you raise a finite amount of dollars
and you kind of know
how much training you're going to do,
but you don't know
exactly what configuration, and
you can go ahead by the compute
in the derivatives market.
And then once you have,
clear view
on exactly what configuration you want,
then you can swap those derivatives
for actual compute.
Talk to us a little bit more about
so I'm trying to think,
oh yeah, the sell side.
So like we have
these like big, big clouds, right.
The ones that everybody knows.
And then you mentioned the neo clouds.
Do you see that changing?
Like what do you see is the future
mix of cloud vendors in the future.
So, that is a great question.
I think that that the whole space
is going to grow,
but that the, you know,
AWS gcp's of the world will make up
a smaller percentage of the whole.
Okay, that's my guess.
But how come,
because there are such proliferation of,
other companies
buying GPUs and deploying them.
Okay. So good answer.
You know, Joe asked you who would be
the natural market participants for this.
I'm going to ask you
the opposite question.
Who wouldn't want this?
Because I think of
some of the hyperscalers.
They seem to like controlling
the GPU supply and maybe squeezing
some of their competitors.
Would you expect resistance from them?
Yeah, I mean, I think the
hyperscalers benefit from opaque pricing
and kind of bundled pricing.
And of course, they would prefer to have
all the GPUs could.
But Nvidia
I would also prefer to have all the GPUs.
You know, that's always a good thing.
But but I think Nvidia wants the GPUs
to be
widely distributed and, and
they're really the ones
that make the call.
This isn't the first time
that there's been an attempt
to create futures markets
out of something, out of technology.
I think there's been multiple efforts
decades ago to like Dram futures.
It doesn't seem that fundamentally
different, although maybe it is.
Why did those fail?
Like when you think about like,
what's going to be different this time?
What was the failure that caused?
Why didn't Dram futures take off?
So so the thing about Dram was that
the price just kept on going down.
So yeah, in a very predictable way.
And so why would you want to buy a futures
contract if you know,
the price in the
future is going to be lower?
Whereas
GPUs, you know, we've certainly gone
through periods
where GPU demand was super high.
And then we've gone through a period
where,
you know, there was kind of some excess.
So there's not a consistent
trajectory of pricing.
I, I think that there will be a consistent
trajectory
lower in terms of,
I don't know, however
you want to measure it, dollars per flop.
Sure.
Dollars per token, I, I think that that's
going to continue to decline.
But the, you know, in
H100 is going to be a useful
GPU for a very long time. And,
and so,
you know, and, and over its life,
I think there will be periods
where there's more demand, less demand,
and, you know, a little bit more
cyclicality and,
less predictability.
So I know the
the Trump administration has said
that they want this market to happen.
Right.
So you seem to have some regulatory,
I guess, tailwind behind you.
Yeah.
I mean, I don't think that I don't think
that this is a controversial thing.
I think that it's pretty clear that,
you know, okay, once
we figure out the right index construction
and have kind of sufficient data
that I don't think
the CFTC would complain about the,
the product.
This is a little bit of a sideways
question
from your attempt to build a, this market.
But speaking of the cloud,
in the in your main business, is it,
I assume your sort of major customers
or users of, the CME?
Are you excited about the CME migration
of its back end to Google Cloud?
Because they tout it.
They talk about their partnership
with Google, etc.
as a client or customer.
What are you enthusiastic about this move?
We interviewed Terry earlier.
Yeah. Said that we was excited for sure.
Yeah.
So so
the problem with so
it depends on what you put into the cloud
and it's totally fine to put,
a lot of things into the cloud,
but the thing that you don't want to
put into the cloud is a matching engine.
Okay.
And and the reason for that is
you want the matching engine
to be as, deterministic as possible.
And so that means that,
if you send two orders into the,
the matching engine, one, let's say,
you know, a couple of microseconds
behind the other one, you want
the one that gets there first to be filled
all the every time. Yeah.
And if you put stuff into the cloud it's
very hard to make that happen.
You wind up getting,
you know, a wide distribution around,
which order will be for filled first and,
and even as you
kind of stretch those times out,
you could have an order that comes in,
you know, maybe a couple milliseconds
later, be filled first, that,
is super disruptive
for liquidity providers.
And it means that,
the liquidity in the market
is going to suffer.
But this is
so, I mean, and you say it's not ideal
for them to put the matching
to have a matching engine in the cloud,
but this is the direction it's going. It.
Yeah.
And it's unclear exactly which part
of the matching engine within the cloud.
Okay.
Is it some kind of,
you know, a dual structure?
I don't know, but
but that's what matters is.
Yeah. Deterministic matching engine.
I mean, if Google can figure out
how to make
a matching
engine in the cloud deterministic,
you know, go for it.
Can you
skeptical that that's even possible?
Can you just describe
the sort of theoretical problem?
What is it about cloud computing
that makes this particular problem
the deterministic aspect difficult,
as opposed to traditional infrastructure?
Well, when you have on prem,
computers, you can, kind of it's
all right there.
You can control where the wires go and.
Oh, I see,
and so when it's in the cloud, it's
a little bit more.
Well, yeah.
Nebulous, I guess. And,
it's just hard to do
as a good pun, I admire it.
So, you know, you mentioned
that you have this long and storied career
in the trading industry.
Starting from old school trading.
And now we're here
talking about GPU trading
and what's in the cloud and what works
and what doesn't.
Tell us what your company is
actually doing when it comes
to practical application of AI.
This is a question we're asking everyone.
We asked all companies to spill
all their proprietary secrets,
excluding the engine,
excluding the engineers.
We know that
they're we know that they're generating.
We know people.
So don't say yes.
We know that they're using
cloud code or whatever.
So besides the engineer.
Yeah, you're right.
That's that's kind of the boring.
Yes. The boy, the.
And then the other thing is
then they when we ask this
question, people say to watch a machine
learning things that.
Yeah, which has been around forever.
So let's talk about actual. Yeah.
Yeah. So, so,
I think that the way that you make,
we make trading
decisions is going to change dramatically.
And and it already is.
You can,
use AI to,
interact with your proprietary data,
your proprietary models,
and suggest trades.
That's pretty cool.
Are you doing that right now?
Yeah.
So, okay, so we're we're
I mean, we're starting to do that.
But but we have some tools that kind of
do that now and, and.
Yeah, the other thing
that's really interesting is to fiddle
around with, with agents,
and have different agents interact.
And so you could,
you could kind of think about,
you know, maybe you have,
you have a couple different analysts,
AI analysts that, both,
work on some stock.
And then you have kind of a, risk
taking agent
or maybe a couple different risk
taking agents
that interact with those analysts
and then come up with trades,
based on that.
So, I mean, these are, you know, that's
a little bit of a theoretical concept,
but I don't think we're that far away
from things like that.
Let's go just on the,
the cloud, trading a little bit more.
I want to.
Yeah, just on the, the cloud trading.
I am really interested in this, topic.
What is the current state today? Just
so that we understand where you're at?
Like, what is today's snapshot of usage
of the platforms?
I mean, as far as where the matching
engines.
Yeah. No, no no, no. Oh, sorry.
The on
the GPU trading like how active is it?
Right now?
Like, what do you like,
where is the state of the business? Oh,
I mean, I, you know, I think last month
we conducted,
I don't know, 5 or 6 auctions,
but it's early.
Yeah. But but it's happening.
So when I think about how, like, futures
contracts are born,
it's usually bespoke options.
And then you get the index like us.
And then you get a forward
and then a future.
That's
kind of how I think about it in my head.
Is that the process that you imagine
for this?
I don't necessarily I think that,
I mean, the, the simplest,
I mean, I yeah, I suppose you could do
some privately negotiated,
compute swap or something,
and maybe that will happen first, but,
no, I think the first thing is
a futures contract
that settles to an index.
If the spot market becomes really liquid
and you have very standardized auctions,
let's say.
And, you know, one of the things
that you asked about was, well,
how do you deal
with the lack of standardize?
You know,
and so one thing is, you go to a certain
type of GPU, you know, H100, for instance.
But even with Nat, you can, you can,
configure them in different ways.
You could use InfiniBand.
Yeah, some other way of connecting them.
And so what's important is
you need to decide on some benchmark
and one of the things
that silicon data has done is
they've actually built
some measurement tools that measure,
you know, how fast a GPU cluster is.
And so,
you can then say, okay, well,
in order for this GPU
to be kind of eligible
to be in the, in the index,
it needs to meet a certain standard.
And and you can there are a couple
different vectors you can measure by.
So I think that that's
kind of how you would do it.
And then
if you got
very liquid auctions,
you could actually have
a futures contract
that cash settles to the auction price.
And then, you know,
people could have the option of either
essentially just, you know, cash
settling their derivative and walking
away, or cash selling their derivative
and participating in the auction.
And they would know that they would,
you know, that price would transfer
from one thing to another.
That that might be
a future state of the world.
And the initial state
is probably just a generic index.
And the futures cash
that ought to be indexed.
What would a market failure
look like in GPU trading?
Because your analogy is the oil market.
And, you know, weird stuff
happens in the oil market.
Could we get negative GPU prices?
Or if everyone wakes up one day
and decides they want to use ChatGPT
as their psychotherapist or whatever,
some people are doing,
could you have a GPU shortage where maybe
people can't deliver into the contract?
So, there are lots of
ways that markets can break and go wrong.
And, and,
you know, I, I remember to this day that,
you know, when oil futures went negative,
it was during Covid.
I was sitting at home,
I was trading oil futures
and I bought oil futures
for negative prices.
You were one of the ones
who actually got it.
So amazing.
But my,
then,
what was that, 2001?
Or 2021?
So yeah, my then 14 year
old said to me, please, please, please,
I want to buy negative
you price futures contracts.
And I said, well, you have no way
of, of taking delivery of the oil.
And he said, I will go to Cushing,
Oklahoma and figure out how to do it.
You really raised,
son, daughter, son, son.
You've
really, he's he's been learning for his,
we have an episode
about taking physical possession of oil.
I do not recommend it.
Turns out if you keep it on your desk
for long enough, it
evaporates into the atmosphere and poisons
your colleagues.
Yeah.
Anyway, anyway, a little bit of a tangent.
But, so
I think on the, you know, upward
trajectory, if there's tons of demand,
you know, that's something that commodity
markets are really good at dealing with.
And, you know, the price will go up
and more supply will come in.
And I think that's all good.
On the downward side,
you know,
you can always just turn the GPUs off.
So I don't think they trade negative.
How how much of the volatility that do you
when you anticipate market volatility
in the price of GPUs?
How much of that like embedded
electricity costs.
So when you buy compute, right,
you're buying the chip but also the power.
Like how much of that volatility
will be the power.
So the industry lingo that's used is
total cost of ownership.
And and you know, what percentage
of the total cost of ownership is
the price is the power price.
Okay. For an H100, it's less than 15%.
Less than 15. Yeah. Okay.
So GPU trading obviously
one of the things you're working
on, but you're a busy guy
and you've got other stuff up your sleeve.
What are you doing
in the realms of tokenized trading?
So, so that is an area that that I'm,
we're super excited about that.
And, and we've been thinking about this
for a very long time.
So in 2012,
when we started
talking about Bitcoin at the RW
and there were a number of
of traders at TRW
that were very excited about Bitcoin,
you were very early into it.
2012 was still pretty early.
Very early. Yeah.
And so we were having these discussions
of, of, you know, why is this interesting.
Is it interesting.
What about it is interesting. And, and
we came away with the following thesis.
You know, there's some small chance
that Bitcoin could be digital gold.
I don't know, you know, call it 1%.
It's kind of an interesting product.
So we should probably make markets in it.
So we we set up Cumberland as the
and you know we didn't call it W
because at the time everybody knew that
anybody trading crypto
was obviously a crock.
So you know, we wanted
to kind of separate the band a little bit.
And, but, you know,
the other thing
was this idea that you could
move value instantaneously
in a trustless
ecosystem was super interesting to me.
And I said, wow, if you could do that
in traditional financial markets,
that would make the markets
so much better.
So much more resilient.
And so we
should really figure out how to do that.
So we started a company called, again,
not very creatively named Digital Asset
Holdings.
Which,
which created the Canton Blockchain.
Initially the Canton Blockchain
was a private permissioned chain.
But, last summer
it actually became a public chain.
And, and that chain was designed
specifically
with tokenization of traditional
financial instruments in mind.
So it has a couple of characteristics.
One is it has configurable privacy.
And believe it or not,
for people who are in the,
you know, finance business,
they don't want to broadcast
to the entire world
when they are buying or selling something.
Right?
I mean, obviously if it's above
the reporting thresholds, you do.
But, but and so,
so that was kind of a fundamental
characteristic of this chain
that's different than Ethereum or Solana
or any of these other things
where if you tokenize
something and put it on top,
and you move it
around, everybody sees it move around.
So, so that's kind of,
something we've been working on
for quite a while.
And how big could this get?
Like, could it swallow everything?
Could you imagine a world in which the
expect, given any financial instrument,
a stock bond, etc., that it all
sort of ends up on chain?
Yeah, I think that everything will be on
chain. Wow.
By when give us a give us a year.
Oh, I'm always way too early on this stuff
but but I, I think in the next
five years it really
all of these instruments will be on chain.
Okay. That's a good time.
Well we will
we will have a live episode in.
We'll come back to Chicago.
We'll revisit that question. Yeah.
It's the idea with tokenized assets
also that you could use that
for collateral management
and use it as a way to move collateral.
100%.
And so everybody's talking about
moving to 24 or 5 or 24 seven markets.
And if you want to do that, it's
really important to,
be able to move collateral 24
or 5 or 24 seven and move variation
margin, 25 5 or 24 seven.
And so, yes, that is
that is a very important use case.
So speaking of very exciting,
sexy topics in trading,
right after you, we're going to be,
speaking with, Tariq, minister of Kelce.
And so prediction markets are super hot.
What is your what where are you at with
them is making markets
and any of these in any of the spaces
right now.
So a million years ago, we, actually
made markets and prediction markets.
I think it
was, I don't know, Intrade or something.
Yeah. And and it never went anywhere.
Nobody cared.
And I always thought, you know, prediction
markets should be a thing.
Everybody should care, but nobody did.
And then, you know, then augur came out,
I was like, oh, this is really cool.
This is going to take off.
And nobody cared. And,
so it's it's taken a long time.
So at this point, we, we use it as,
you know, as a reference price.
You know, obviously during the election,
it was super helpful to,
you know, kind of,
use that as a gauge of.
Oh, so you were actually using that
because, you know, we hear stories
about institutional investors
maybe finding prediction markets useful.
Perhaps. But you were
you were looking at it.
We were definitely looking at it.
We were not using it as a hedge.
And, you know, it was it was funny.
Shane messaged me and said, hey, you know,
it's it's, it's up on Bloomberg now.
And I was like,
no, no, no, it's awesome. Shane.
The Shane Copeland from polymer.
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah.
But currently like do you, do you foresee
like are you going to enter now
either in making markets
on some of these exchanges
and would you get into the
the sports, the sports contracts?
I mean, so we're not so here
I think it's highly likely
that we'll, start
trading some of the prediction markets.
You know,
some of our competitors
already trade in the, in the sports
markets pretty actively. We don't.
So it's not necessarily a natural fit,
but but, you know,
I don't have, like,
a religious opposition to it.
Would there be different considerations
for trading in a prediction market
versus a traditional financial asset?
Are there different things
you have to think about, either
in terms of like pricing the trade
or maybe risk management?
Well, I think it depends on what
the prediction market is.
I mean, if you're
if you're trading a prediction market on,
I don't know
whether somebody will throw,
you know, rubber object on to WNBA court.
Then I mean, that's something that,
that, you know,
people in the audience can control.
And so it seems like providing liquidity
in that you would be at a disadvantage.
That was a very particular example,
by the way.
I was going to go with Taylor Swift
getting married, but you went with that
one. Well, these are markets
that people can directly intervene
on an incestuous
as opposed to inside of their own.
Yeah. Anti-social behavior.
That's right.
And as opposed to,
you know,
will the fed cut 25 or 50 or stay on hold?
I mean, that is you
can you can trade that in,
you know, Sofr you can trade that
in in the fed funds futures.
There are some binaries you can trade.
And so the prediction
market version of that is, is,
you know, totally fits in with the risk
that we already trade.
So we mentioned
in the intro, there's going to be
this big, meeting in DC next week.
And we just happened to sort of
catch a bunch of the participants.
When you look at the landscape
for these new futures
platforms,
because that's what they are, right.
The CME like does has regulation
been part of their dominant,
has regulation made it harder
for other entrants
to cut into sumi margins or volumes?
So, I'm
trying to say I'm trying to ask questions
that are going to create some tension
around the table next week.
Yeah. Yeah.
So so here, I mean, yeah, you should hear
what Terry said about how we're neck.
I it'll be on the podcast.
I, I'm, I'm sure I can,
I can probably repeat it
without having,
so it, here, once
you have a liquid market in something,
it becomes a natural monopoly.
Yeah.
It's very hard
to move that to a different venue.
It's happened before
I, I was living in London in the mid 90s,
and, the bond futures were,
you know, on the floor of the life.
It was this huge trading pit
with a bunch of guys
pushing and shoving and,
and over the course
of 12 months, the,
you know, DTV, now called
the euro was able to move
the entire bond futures
complex on to the computer.
On a different exchange now.
I mean,
they gave hefty incentives to people.
I think they went to the
all the German banks and they said,
don't you dare trade on life anymore.
So it's possible, but I think that
these things are generally,
I don't think that it's really
a regulatory issue
that causes them to be sticky.
I think it's just kind of that unnatural
state of affairs, network effect, I guess.
So our theme for this evening
is obviously the future of trading.
And one of the things
that seems to be happening
is the sort of intermingling
of professional and retail trading.
And we again talked about that with Terry.
I'm sure we're about to talk about it
with, the CEO.
But from your perspective, and again,
you started this career back
when I don't think there were
any retail traders doing day trading.
Really.
How is that changed
the way you think about trading?
And can you envision a future where,
I don't know, I fires all of us
and we're all going to be just day
trading from home as an insurance policy?
I it's really or I should say
Robinhood is really a full employment
program, maybe for U.S. workers, maybe.
Yeah.
So so I mean, that is that is a thesis
that, that I have heard
is that what's happening is,
a bunch of, you know,
relatively successful
people are losing their jobs.
And they're retiring.
But in their retirement,
they decide to just,
manage their portfolios on Robinhood.
And so there's this surge in trading
activity that, you know, wouldn't
have happened ten years ago,
and it's only going to grow from here.
And, and I don't know, maybe that's right.
Do you like
it feels to me like, culturally
because you're talking about like,
why have prediction markets taken off when
they've been around for over 20 years?
I think I first heard about them
in like 2002 or 2003.
They've suddenly taken off.
There's all this sort of, you know, the
there was never a bright line between
what's gambling and what's sort of hedging
or what's trading, but there's clearly
whatever line that is just feels like it's
completely collapsing.
Is this good?
Do you have an opinion like should should,
is, there is,
is, and I don't know
if any of our opinions
matter on the question
because it feels like culturally
we're entering this world where everything
will be tradable on any app and there's,
you know, you're going to see a price
for gold futures right next
to one day, the line on a football
match, etc..
Is it do we want this world? So,
I don't think there's anything
particularly wrong with it.
But I am a little bit
confused about, whether,
prediction
markets and sports are actually consistent
with what the Commodity Exchange Act
says is permissible.
And so, you know,
I know that, you know, you're next.
Yeah. You're setting us up perfectly.
Here's, you know, benefits
from, his ability to list these contracts.
And and I don't know if, you know,
the CFTC is just kind of asleep,
and I know
they're kind of understaffed now.
Or do you want to stay on stage?
Yeah, you can,
because you can just anyway.
Or or maybe they've decided that actually,
these are economically important.
Transactions
that that are consistent with the.
Yeah, it's unclear to me. Amazing.
All right.
Well, we're going to have to leave it
there, but Don Wilson,
founder and CEO of W.
Q thank you so much for being here.
