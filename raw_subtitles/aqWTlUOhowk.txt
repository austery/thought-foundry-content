- It is nicer to think that you are here
for some kind of reason
that's written into the rules
of the universe and that
it all is just a happy
or unhappy accident.
I think that there are very
good arguments to believe
that there are some kind
of foundational principle
of the universe, some
necessarily existing being,
some first cause.
But I think that the
Judeo-Christian tradition
is an imperfect approximation
of who that being is.
Nihilism doesn't remove
values, it analyzes values
and finds them to be
essentially groundless,
or if they do have a ground,
subjective preferences of people.
It's a very difficult
thing to define concepts
like good and bad, but we
employ them all the time.
Like what is the difference
between a murder just occurred
and it's wrong that that
murder just occurred?
If you try to isolate what the
actual difference is there,
I think it has to just be an attitude,
it's an expression, it's the way you feel.
My name's Alex O'Connor.
I'm the host of the
"Within Reason" podcast.
I think I'm best described
as a philosophy YouTuber
and former edgy atheist.
- [Narrator] Chapter 1:
The strongest arguments
for and against the existence of God.
- So I think probably the
most powerful argument
for the existence of God is the so-called
first cause argument, which
is quite, like, naive.
A lot of people are familiar with the idea
that we need a first
cause for the universe,
but I think people think about it wrong.
There is what you might think of
as a horizontal causal argument
and a hierarchical causal argument.
And a lot of people just aren't familiar
with the hierarchical version
of the causal argument,
which I think is probably
best explained with a prop,
like this lovely glass of water.
You might ask yourself,
"Why is this water here?"
And the way that people
tend to think about cause
is in terms of time and
what happened before,
what might be called the efficient causes
in the Aristotelian sense, which is,
well, somebody just poured
the water into the glass.
And then I might ask,
"Well, why did they pour
the water into the glass?"
"Oh, well because you asked them to."
"Oh, well, why did you do that?"
"Well, because the glass was
empty, because I'm thirsty,"
so on and so forth, back infinitely.
There's just no beginning.
It's just as long as every single step
is explained by the step before,
then everything gets
explained back in time.
But there's another way that
you can think about causation.
I can say, "Why is this water here?"
Well, because it's being
held up by the glass, right?
If the glass wasn't there,
the water would just fall out,
or at least wouldn't like retain its shape
even if we were in space.
The water is in the glass right now
because it's being held up by the glass.
In that sense, the shape
and position of the water
right now is being caused by the shape
and position of the glass.
Okay, so why is the glass there?
Because it's being held up by my hand.
Why is my hand there?
Being held up by my arm.
My arm's being held up by my shoulder.
My shoulder's being held up by my body.
My body is being held up by the chair.
The chair is being held up by the ground.
The ground is being held
up by the foundations
of the building and so on.
And if you kept going, you
might get to the gravity
that's pulling the building down.
You might get the forces of nature
which are holding the earth together.
But ultimately all of
this is happening now
in a time slice and hierarchically.
This isn't some causation
that goes back in time.
It's sort of goes up and down
if you can see what I mean.
So there is a reason why that kind
of causation cannot go on infinitely.
And that is that in each
stage of this causal chain,
the causal actor doesn't
have any causal power
except insofar as it borrows it
from something more fundamental.
I'll try and put that in simpler terms.
The glass holds up the water,
but it can't do it of its own accord.
It's being held up by my hand
to the extent that if I took away my hand,
the glass would no longer
have the power to hold
the water here, right?
So the glass is power, the
causal power to have to cause
the water to be where it is right now
is literally borrowed from my hand.
But likewise, if I removed my arm,
my hand would no longer have the power
to hold the water where it is.
So my hand doesn't have on
its own any kind of power
to hold up the glass.
It borrows it from my arm.
And my arm borrows it from my shoulder.
And my shoulder borrows it from my body.
To the extent that if I were
to remove any of those parts
in the causal chain,
everything further up the chain
than that would instantly
lose its causal power
to hold the water up where it is, right?
Instantly.
So what that means is that
there is no actual causal power
except for whatever is
at the basis of this
giving the whole chain causal power.
So if you think about that
horizontal causation, right?
Imagine a series of dominoes
knocking each other over.
This is causation in time.
Domino one is knocked
over by domino minus one,
and domino minus one is knocked
over by domino minus two,
minus three, minus four, minus five,
and so on back to infinity.
In this kind of causation,
when domino minus five
knocks over domino minus four,
and then the dominoes keep falling over,
I could take domino minus five
that caused all these other
do dominoes fall over,
I could take that earlier
cause, I could take it,
I could throw it in the bin.
We don't need it anymore.
Those dominoes further down the chain
would keep on going, right?
It's the kind of causation
where you don't require
the first causes, the earlier causes
to remain in existence
in order for the causal chain to continue.
So another example of this would be
like parents and children.
My grandfather caused my father to exist.
Then my grandfather died.
After my grandfather died,
my father caused me to exist.
Right, so like you've
got cause A, B and C,
A causes B, A then just
disappears, gets into C,
and B still has the causal
power to bring about C.
You see what I'm saying?
You don't need that first
cause to remain there.
But that's in this so-called
horizontal causation, right?
In a hierarchical series of causation,
you can't get rid of the earlier cause.
And when we say earlier
or first or fundamental,
we don't mean in time.
We mean like sort of further
down the chain as it were.
So if my grandfather causes my father,
then my grandfather dies,
my father still has the causal
power to bring me about.
But if my shoulder causes
the position of my arm,
then if my shoulder disappears,
my arm no longer has the
power to hold up my hand.
The shoulder needs to
stay there causing the arm
in order for the arm to cause the hand.
So all of that causation
happens all at once, right?
Which means that there is
no intrinsic causal power.
My father has his own causal
power to bring about me,
but my arm only borrows
it from my shoulder.
It doesn't have it on its own.
But my shoulder only
borrows it from my body,
and my body only borrows
it from the chair.
Without the chair, none of this
would have any causal power.
My hand would not be able to be here.
And without the floor,
none of that would be able
to do anything.
So there's no causal power
at all in this chair,
except insofar as it borrows it right now
in this instant from the ground below it.
So if this just goes back infinitely,
well, this borrows from this
and this borrows from this
and this borrows, and that goes back
on literally infinitely,
then there is no causal power
at all because it's not
being borrowed from anywhere.
It's like everyone is just
borrowing from another thing
which has no causal power.
It only gets its causal power,
it's borrowed it from something else
which has no causal power.
So where did it get it from?
It borrowed it from something else,
which has no causal power.
So where did that get it from?
That can't go back forever
because then there would be
literally no causal power
in this instant right now.
So unlike the temporal thing
where you can go back in time
and imagine that just
sort of goes on infinitely
and there's no first cause,
because each individual
causal actor in the chain
has its own causal power to
knock over the next domino,
the hierarchical causation
in this time slice right now,
this glass being held up right now
has some kind of foundational cause
which is giving life to
this entire causal chain
without which the whole
thing would would fall apart.
So it's a sustaining cause.
It's things to exist and be
as they are right now in time,
not like a billion years
ago set something in motion,
but right now sustaining it in existence.
In the same way that like
the law of gravity sustains
all of the objects in
this room in position,
it's a fundamental cause of why everything
is being held up right now.
If that just switched
off, like the entire thing
would fall apart, right?
And you need that now, right now,
like at the basis of
this sort of causal chain
of floors holding up chairs
and chairs holding up buildings
and stuff like that.
And so you might say, "Well,
maybe the fundamental cause
there then is something
like the law of gravity."
Fine, but you might wanna ask
sort of what's holding the
law of gravity in place.
What's making sure that it
won't stop working tomorrow?
And this is this sort of great debate
with something like this argument.
And there are lots of technical terms
that you can throw in there.
You can talk about
contingency and necessity,
and you can talk about
per se and per accidens
causal chains and stuff, but
let's just do away with that
for a moment and just think
about it in those terms.
What is holding up this
invisible microphone
that I promise our listeners
is above my head right now in place?
And, like, the depth of
explanation you go to
will be context dependent.
If I say, "What's holding
up that microphone?"
our audio engineer might say,
"Well, it's the mic stand," right?
But the physicist might
say, "Oh, it's the floor
pressing up against the mic stand."
But the philosopher will say it's whatever
is at the foundation of that causal chain
giving causal power to it all.
And that is the strongest version
of a first cause argument,
I think, one that's insensitive to time
and one which requires that first cause
to exist right now.
So this alone isn't
strong enough to establish
the existence of capital G God, right?
Like this just establishes
that there is some kind of fundamental
sustaining principle of the universe.
Now there are lots of
debates as to the nature
of what that thing could be,
but the thing that's
really important to note
is that there's no singular argument
for the existence of God.
What you have is a kind
of cumulative case.
You have different arguments that deal
with different aspects of God.
So this kind of causal
argument is discussed
by Thomas Aquinas in
his "Summa Theologica."
He gives five famous
ways of sort of showing
the existence of God to be true,
and the first three are
kinds of causal arguments.
You have to then do more to
get the attributes of God.
You have to do more to show
that this thing is not material,
that this thing is certainly more to show
that it's like good or
loving or anything like that.
But so Aquinas has an
argument from change.
I mean, it's called the
argument from motion,
but motion just means change
in some sort of older
dialect of philosophy.
So he leans quite heavily on Aristotle,
and it gets a bit complicated,
but he'll say something like,
"For something to change
means that something which
is potential becomes actual."
That's what change is.
Like a hot cup of coffee will cool down
because when it was hot, it had
the potential to become cool
and that potential was actualized.
Potential can only be actualized
by something which is already actual.
Potential can't be
actualized by potential.
Like if the coffee cools down
because it's in a fridge,
the potential coldness of the coffee
can't be brought into existence
by the potential coldness of the fridge.
The fridge has to be actually cold
in order to bring about
the potential coldness
in the coffee, right?
It can't just be you've got
a potentially cold fridge
and a potentially a cold cup of coffee
and the potential coldness
brings about the potential...
No, you have to have an actual thing
actualizing the potential
in the coffee, right?
And that's what he thinks change is.
But you have another kind
of causal argument then.
Any instance of change
where something potential
becomes actual, there has to
have been something actual
to actualize it.
But there will have had
to have been something
to actualize that thing
and to actualize that thing
and to actualize that thing.
And so Aquinas sort of
follows this causal chain
and says again, at the
beginning, there must be a,
as Aristotle might have had
it, an unactualized actualizer,
something which is pure act.
Now this gets really kind
of technical and weird,
but Aquinas then tries to draw out
why it would be that if something
has zero potential in it,
it can't be material, for example.
Because if something is material,
you could potentially divide it.
You could potentially move it.
There are things that are
like potential about it,
it has potential qualities.
And so if the first cause of the universe
has to be pure act, no
potentiality, pure act,
then whatever is the cause of the universe
can't be material.
So now we've got an immaterial
first cause of the universe,
and then we carry on in a similar vein
using different arguments to
show why this thing must be
outside of time, outside of space.
And you end up with
something like a spaceless,
timeless creative first
cause of the universe
powerful enough to bring
the universe into existence.
And if you don't wanna call
that God, that's fine by me,
but I think it will
suffice for most people.
The strongest argument
against the existence of God
as traditionally conceived is undoubtedly
the problem of evil.
I prefer to say the problem of suffering
because a lot of the time
being an ethical emotivist,
especially a religious person will say,
"Well, how can you call anything evil
if you've got no standard of goodness?"
Okay, let's not say evil
then. Let's say suffering.
If you believe that there is a loving God
who has the power to
do all that is possible
and who supervises not just the goings on
of the universe, but also
supervised its creation
and the setting up of its parameters,
there are a few questions that
jump out, a few mysteries.
For example, life on Earth is the result
of evolution by natural selection.
That is the reason why
we have such complexity
and such variance of life.
Natural selection is
survival of the fittest.
Survival of the fittest is the same thing
as the destruction and death
and suffering of the weakest.
For billions of years,
there's been life on earth.
And for much of that, it's
existed in a brutal competition
for survival, with predation and disease.
And 99.9% of all the species,
let alone the creatures,
but the species who've ever existed
being wiped from existence,
usually in a pretty dismal manner.
And all of this is built
into the very mechanism
by which God chose to bring
about human life on Earth.
Traditional religious communities believe
that humans are very special.
They think that we are the
reason why this all exists
as opposed to other animals
and other points in history.
Which means that all of this
has occurred for our sake.
It's built in.
It's one thing to talk about suffering
as a sort of abstract object.
But it is unfathomable, truly,
the amount of suffering
that these animals,
not just like the human species
in its 200,000-year history,
or I suppose the human
species would be much longer
than that, a few million years.
But the animals who came before us
and the animals who existed
at the same time as us,
it's genuinely unfathomable
the depths of despair
and misery and suffering and torment,
meaningless torment for those animals
who don't get to inherit eternal life.
And we're told that for some
reason God chose this mechanism
to bring us into existence.
It just doesn't seem to
be what you would expect.
Of course, this doesn't
disprove the existence of God.
It's not like logically contradictory
to say that God did this for some reason.
But it just seems a little unexpected.
And I think for most
people it's very powerful.
Of course, this only really does anything
to argue against the
existence of a good God.
And some people will then just say,
"Well, maybe God is evil."
But this will then just
depend on your view of God.
Because there are philosophers who,
in the course of proving God's existence,
have established why he must
be perfectly good, for example.
There are also people who
belong to religious traditions
who insist upon the goodness of God.
So they would at least
have to give up that
if they were to accept the plausibility
of an argument like this.
And I think it's powerful.
I think that there are very
good arguments to believe
that there are some kind
of foundational principle
of the universe, some
necessarily existing being,
some first cause.
But I think that the
Judeo-Christian tradition
is an imperfect approximation
of who that being is.
I think it probably gets a lot right
and is a sort of compilation
of human theological wisdom
over the past few thousand years,
but it will get a lot wrong as well.
I think that if you have
just personally apprehended
a truth about the universe,
you are just convicted
that there's some kind
of foundational cause,
"I don't really know much more than that
and I don't want to subscribe
to a particular tradition,"
I say more power to you.
I think you're on the right track.
In the same way that if somebody
is sort of a dogmatic atheist
of the new atheist variety,
I have a lot of fun posing
religious arguments to them
and saying like that
there might actually be
more plausibility to these arguments
than you would know from
reading "The God Delusion."
But that's not enough to say
that you are wrong about
your atheism or anything.
But I much prefer this kind
of person who says either
I believe there's some kind
of God of maybe of some sort,
maybe not even a God, maybe
just something like that.
But I don't really know what it is.
I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, me
too, man, I've got no idea."
Likewise somebody who
says, "I just, you know,
there's a lot of mysteries,
but I just can't buy the fact
that this was designed
somehow intelligently."
I'm like, "Yeah, I get
that too. That's awesome."
And then we can just discuss it, you know?
And so I quite like that kind of person.
There are also the so-called deists
who typically are described
as people who believe that God
kind of set the universe in
motion and then went away.
So does not involve himself.
I mean, he could have died,
he could have gone to sleep
and sort of set it all off.
And that explains how it got going,
but it's not there anymore.
I don't think that makes much sense.
I think that this is a product
of mechanistic thinking
that comes about with the
sort of scientific revolution.
But we think of everything as sort of like
a bit of a machine where you
twist it up and let it go.
But the argument that I just ran through,
the reason I like it so much
is because I think it gets rid
of this idea of deism.
You can't have a God who
sets it all in motion
and then goes to sleep.
He can't knock over the
first domino and then go away
and the dominoes keep on
falling over and he's long dead,
because he is not just
knocked over a domino
and then gone away.
He's holding up the
microphone above my head
right now in this instant.
And if he were to disappear,
the whole thing would just collapse.
I think that there's a
more powerful argument
for that kind of God, not to say personal,
not to say that he cares
about human beings, right?
Like, because again,
you can distinguish between those things.
There's like, people say,
"Well, I believe that there is a God,
but he has no interest in human affairs."
That's fair enough.
But someone who says,
"Well, I believe in a God,
but he's just like not
around anymore, like at all,"
I think that might be true,
there might be no God.
But if you think there's a good argument
for God's existence, I think
the best versions of arguments
for God's existence require
that he does stick around.
And so I think you either
kind of have to say
there's no God at all, or there's a God
who's still here right now
holding it all in place
as we speak.
I don't think this God at
the beginning but not anymore
makes much sense to me.
- [Narrator] Chapter 2:
Understanding nihilism
and the human condition.
- Nihilism comes in many forms,
and depending on the context
can mean many different things.
But most broadly it's
probably the lack of belief in
or belief that there is no such thing
as an objective purpose to life,
or to the actions that we commit
and the behaviors that
we portray within life.
Whenever anybody acts in any way,
when I pick up a glass
of water to have a drink,
when I walk to a bus stop or something,
there will be a reason why I've done that.
These kinds of behaviors don't
just spring up ex nihilo.
They exist for some kind of reason.
And so if you ask me why
it is that I'm reaching
my arm over there, it might be because
I'm trying to pick up a glass of water.
Well why am I doing that? I
don't just do that randomly.
Well, because I'm thirsty.
Okay, well why am I thirsty?
Well, now we're kind of into
some biological science.
You might say, "Well, it's been a while
since I've last had a drink."
And then you might describe
what it is about my
biology that causes thirst.
And you might even give an
evolutionary explanation
for why it is that we've developed
this sensitivity to thirst.
And eventually this kind of
has to bottom out somewhere.
But as soon as we're in this level of like
biological science, which
seems to be kind of outside
of my own volition and desire and control,
I suddenly realized that if
the reason I'm reaching my arm
over right now is ultimately speaking
because of some evolutionary principle
that I had no control over,
that's just a result of animals
fighting for survival, then
my reaching my hand over there
kind of feels a bit silly now.
It feels like I'm like
beholden to something
which is not reasonable,
is not some kind of God-given purpose,
there's nothing good about
about drinking the water
or anything like that.
I'm just sort of following
my evolutionary drives.
And a process like that
for a lot of people
will feel quite devoid of
meaning because you realize
that you're just beholden to your
sort of animalistic instincts essentially
with almost everything you do.
The thing that the nihilist recognizes
is that the values he or
she holds are not grounded
in anything other than
their own preferences
or aesthetic preferences.
So to be a nihilist is not to,
it's not to have no desire.
It's not to have no,
no motivation to act.
A lot of people think that
if you lived like a nihilist,
you'd sort of rot away in bed.
Some nihilists may do that,
and I think there is actually
a correlation, a strong correlation
between philosophical nihilism
and practical depression.
However, nihilism is not
about the actual consequences
or the things that you're doing.
It's about the purpose behind them.
It's about the meaning behind them.
And so suppose that you
are feeling thirsty.
I could explain to you
that the only reason
you are feeling thirst is
because of some animalistic drive
that you had no control over.
And you might go, "Wow, that makes this
all a bit ridiculous, doesn't it?"
But you're still thirsty.
You still have that desire.
You still have that value
of quenching of thirst,
and so you'll still do that.
And the same applies in all areas of life,
including art and music and poetry,
but also including
relationships, friendships,
that kind of stuff.
You're still going to
want to do those things.
But the nihilist is
someone who sort of takes
a bird's eye view of it and realizes that
it's all a little bit meaningless.
It's like Camus famously describes
in "The Myth of Sisyphus"
this person who suddenly
recognizes the structure
of their day, you know,
waking up, having breakfast,
getting in the car, going
to work, taking a break,
eating some food, going
back home, eating some food,
going to sleep, starting again.
And you sort of start to
notice that you are doing this.
And it's not anything
about what you're doing,
it's realizing, taking a
step back and realizing that
there's no meaning to any of this,
that there's nothing more
than just my doing it.
It doesn't go any deeper than that.
Meaning, I think, is used
synonymously with purpose.
To have meaning is to
have some kind of purpose.
And purpose is something like
reason to act or reason to be.
So to have meaning or to have purpose,
I think, is to have some
kind of reason to either act.
If you're talking about
the meaning in an action,
it's the reason to act in that way.
If you're talking about
the meaning of or in life,
it's the reason to live,
or the reason that we are alive, right?
Now, like I said before,
there always will be
some kind of reason, but that
reason will be contingent
on something else.
So the reason why I'm reaching my hand
is because I want to get the water,
but the reason why I want the water
is contingent on something
else, that is that I'm thirsty.
And the reason that I'm thirsty
is contingent on something else.
So to find an objective
meaning at the root of life
would mean finding a non-contingent
reason to act or to be.
There would just need to be
a self-justifying principle
where if you ask "But why?"
the answer and the truthful
answer would be it just is,
or that why is an inappropriate question
to ask any further.
For there to be something
for this to bottom out in
it will either have to
bottom out in something
completely arbitrary, which
feels meaningless to people
because it could have
easily been something else,
or this contingent chain of reasoning
just essentially goes back
forever, which seems implausible,
or it terminates in something
which is self-justifying.
And when people say that they
found their meaning in life,
I think a lot of the time they found
that self-justifying principle.
For some people, their
meaning in life might be
the raising of their children.
And if you ask them, "Why
are you getting out of bed?"
"To go to work."
"Why are you doing that?" "To make money."
"Why? "To provide for my family."
"Why?" "To bring up my
children healthily."
"Why?" "Because I want my
children to be healthy."
"Why?" "What do you mean why?
That's it, that's what it's about."
And the philosopher might
look at that and say,
"Well, you should still probably ask why
as a point of interest, why
do you care about that?"
But in practice, that
moment that you reach
where that question why
just seems inappropriate,
that's where you've bottomed out.
And if you find some kind
of self-justifying principle
that ultimately motivates
most of your actions,
it's what you sort of have
in the back of your mind
when you're doing anything.
And for most people it
probably is relational,
it's probably got to do with children
or spouses or something like that.
For the religious, it will be God.
Everything they do, even
if they don't cognize it
all the time will be for the glory of God.
If you ask them to proactively
analyze what they're doing,
"Well, why are you doing this?
Why are you sat here doing
an interview with people?"
Ultimately they would say something like,
"Well you know, it's all
for the glory of God."
Everybody will have that
self-justifying principle
somewhere at the basis of their thinking.
And if you're a secular
person, if you're an atheist,
it will likely be something else.
I might say that, "Well, I really enjoy
doing this kind of thing.
I think it's a meaningful pursuit
because I like discussing big questions."
And if somebody says,
"Well, why are big questions
in life important?"
Somebody might just
say, "What do you mean?
Of course they are.
That's almost the
definition of importance."
Now you can pick a hole with
that, and a nihilist will.
They'll say that you can always go deeper
and you will realize that
ultimately it's just preference,
which is why the nihilist thinks
that there's no objective meaning.
But most people have some kind
of self-justifying principle,
it's just usually a subjective one.
Objective meaning would
look something like a reason
to act that is self-justifying
and not because,
not dependent on some kind
of preference that you have.
So if your foundational
self-justifying principle
is your care for your
children, it seems quite clear
that your care for your
children is subjective,
it's dependent on you.
After all, you don't care
about other people's children
in the same way and they
don't care about your children
in the same way.
It seems like if you died
and your children with you,
there'd be no, like this kind of principle
wouldn't exist out there in the ether.
It seems completely dependent
on your circumstances
and your preferences.
It seems a bit crude to describe
your care for your
children as a preference,
but broadly speaking, it
is a kind of preference.
You prefer the wellbeing of your children
over the wellbeing of other children.
And in fact, that's a lot
of the time what caring
for the wellbeing of
your children is about,
it's providing them with
a roof over their head
and a stable income, which
oftentimes is to the detriment
of other people who are
competing for the same job,
but you have this preference.
But it seems quite clear that
that is person dependent.
Right, like for there to
be an objective meaning
would mean that it is
insensitive to preference.
It would mean that even for somebody
who just had different preferences,
who just didn't want children,
if caring for your children
were the objective meaning
in life, then if somebody
said, "Well, you know what,
I just don't want children.
It's just not something
that appeals to me.
I think I wouldn't be a good parent."
Then you would say to
them, "You are wrong.
You are literally incorrect
about the meaning in your own life."
And some people think this,
but what they mean is
something like, "Oh, I think
that if you had kids, you'd
actually like it," right?
But that's just saying that you predict
that they will subjectively prefer it too.
Like to say it's objective would be,
even if you don't prefer it,
even if you have children
and actually hate the
whole process and think,
"Gosh, this is awful and terrible,"
your life will still be more meaningful
even if you don't think it is.
It would have to be something
which provides meaning
completely independent
of your preferences,
of how you actually feel about
what it is that you're doing,
if that makes sense.
If meaning just means a reason
to act or a reason to be,
then of course ultimately I do think
there is some kind of literal explanation
for why we behave in the way that we do.
And that will be objective in the sense
that that will be the driving
force behind our behaviors,
whether we like it or not.
So if you are an atheist materialist,
you might think that
evolution by natural selection
has simply favored certain traits
which produce certain behaviors.
And I could say, literally speaking,
the reason why you are
behaving in this way,
the reason why you have these preferences
is because of this
evolutionary trait, right?
For most people, that's
not very fulfilling.
But literally speaking,
that could be something
like an objective meaning
in the sense of it being
an objective purpose.
It is literally the
purpose why we all act.
But I think people want something
a little bit more than that.
They want something which feels like
it's not quite just a reason to act.
It's also something
which feels worthwhile,
that's somehow sort of justified
by some universal principle.
There's almost like a moral element,
that it's a good thing to be alive,
that it's a good thing to
live a meaningful life.
And that kind of thing I think
is very difficult to ground objectively,
unless you posit some kind of
either supernatural design,
or I suppose if you have
a kind of philosophy of
life, or a metaphysic
which says that there is
some kind of teleology
built into nature itself,
which some people believe
but I struggle to grapple with.
I think human beings naturally
desire certain things
and they have values.
And I think this is probably
an evolutionary trait.
I mean, if you had two communities,
one of which sort of just
didn't care about anything,
were completely apathetic,
didn't care about their own children,
didn't care to have children,
didn't care to get outta bed,
they're not gonna survive for very long.
So I think it is just literally the case
that having some kind
of sense of motivation
for doing things in life is
evolutionarily selected for.
And so I think the most people
are not actually fundamentally apathetic.
Even people who seem apathetic
actually have certain values,
they value their own comfort, for example.
Like if you sort of wake up
and you just wanna go back
to sleep, it's not apathy.
That's having a different value
to the kind of value that
would get you out of bed.
You value your comfort,
you value sleeping.
And so most people have
these kinds of values.
Nihilism doesn't remove values.
It analyzes values and finds them
to be essentially groundless.
Or if they do have a ground,
the ground is within the
subjective preferences of people.
And so, like, I understand why,
I mean, nihilism might
make you act in a way
that would be viewed as apathetic.
It might make you a bit
depressed, for example.
And it might mean that
you lay around a bit more
and you have less motivation
for doing the things you formally enjoyed,
all of those things that
come along with depression.
But you'll still have literal values.
You will not enjoy your own pain.
If hungry, you will feel that hunger,
whether or not you choose to satisfy it.
You'll have experiences that
you want when experienced
and experiences that you
don't want when experienced,
which I think is a good
definition of pleasure and pain.
And so what does nihilism do then?
It just removes the
meaning in those values.
And so I would sort of like
to imagine that the person
who is suffering, it's
helpful to think of a person
who's suffering but is not a nihilist.
You could have the
worst life in the world.
You could be depressed, you
could be upset every single day.
You could think your
life is going terribly,
but you could believe that
there's some kind of reason.
You could believe that
there's a meaning behind it.
Maybe you're religious, maybe
you believe in reincarnation,
whatever, such that you're suffering
but you're not an nihilist.
To be an nihilist is to suffer
and suffer all the more
from the recognition
that the suffering is meaningless.
So in principle, you could
also be really happy,
you could be having the best time
in the world and be a nihilist
so long as you recognize
that that happiness
you're feeling is completely meaningless.
There's no reason for it.
You are just feeling it.
You just exist, and you're
feeling a certain thing,
and that's it.
In practice, nihilism tends to make people
more sad than happy.
But as a philosophy, let's
say, a philosophy of life,
there's no inconsistency
with being a very motivated,
very happy, very content person
who yet realizes that there's
no meaning behind any of it.
There is the fact that most
people, literally speaking,
do feel meaning in life.
And it does seem a little bit
bold to say that everybody
who reports that is
essentially either lying
or deluding themselves.
That seems bold.
It seems a little arrogant
and too confident.
Not to say that that makes it false,
but I think you should
be aware of how radical
a claim that is, of course.
But also there does seem to be
this universal compulsion towards meaning.
It's like, obviously, there
is this universal compulsion
to think that there is some
reason why we're all here.
Now, like I said before,
that could be explained
through evolutionary
self-selecting pressures.
But in a way you might just
say that that's kind of enough,
because the only thing
that matters is that I feel
as though there is objective meaning.
Like that might just be enough for people
in the sense that nihilism
as a lived philosophy,
that like informs the way that you behave,
you might just sort of,
you might just sort of accept the fact
that everybody universally has this drive
and treat it as if it were objective.
In the same way that like,
if you're trying to work out
what color to paint a house,
and, like, color is completely subjective,
but if it just so happened that everybody,
for some evolutionary reason,
preferred the color blue,
like, absolutely everybody just in fact
preferred the color blue,
you might treat it as an objective fact
that blue is the best
color to paint the house.
And in that context,
that might become a meaningful statement.
Even though you recognize it's
not technically objective,
it's just universally subjectively true.
But in practice, that
sort of works the same
as an objective truth,
if you know what I mean.
So you would paint the house blue,
and if anybody said you
should paint it another color,
you might be able to say to them,
"You're kind of wrong,"
even though you're just
dealing with preferences.
So the universality of felt meaning
or desire for meaning or
assumption that there is meaning
might be enough to raise a few eyebrows
when it comes to nihilism.
Nihilism is often seen
as a kind of response
to the decline of religion.
And you get thinkers like Nietzsche,
you get thinkers like Emil Cioran.
And then a bit later on you
get your existentialists
and your absurdists, you get your Sartres
and your Camus, right?
But this goes way further back.
Like, nihilism is not a new philosophy
in response to the decline of religion.
I think that religions emerge
as a response to nihilism.
I think it's the other way around.
One of the still greatest
expositions of nihilism
that can be found in the printed word
is the book of Ecclesiastes
in the Old Testament.
Just this nihilistic outpouring,
"'Meaningless, everything is meaningless,'
says the Teacher."
Ecclesiastes takes us through
the reflections of this man,
this anonymous author.
Some have tried to identify him,
but it doesn't really matter who it is.
We know that he was a great man, a king.
He lived an illustrious life,
but he saw no meaning in it.
And he keeps coming
back to this word hebel
which means literally
something like wind, right?
And so it's translated as
vanity by the King James,
vanity of vanities.
Everything is vanity.
I've heard some exegetes think
that the best modern
translation of that word hebel
in Hebrew is actually absurd
in alignment with Camus'
rubbing up of our expectations
against the great iconoclast
of reality which just shatters
all of our expectations.
But "Meaningless, meaningless,
everything is meaningless,"
is one translation.
"Absurd, absurd, everything
is absurd," is my favorite.
because he's describing these things.
He's like, "I denied my eyes
no pleasure that they saw.
If I wanted something, I took it.
I drank wine. I partied, I lived life.
But in the end I saw
that it was all hebel,
it was all just wind.
It's just nothing. It just
happens, and then it's gone.
And it doesn't mean anything."
And clearly whoever penned
this text is struggling deeply
with the exact same nihilistic themes
that we talk about today.
And for him, this is a piece
of religious scripture.
So there's this undertone,
he keeps saying that
under the sun there is
nothing, there's no meaning,
there's no purpose to any of this.
It's where we get the phrase
"nothing new under the sun."
Under the sun, is this phrase
that keeps showing up in Ecclesiastes.
And some have suggested that
this is supposed to indicate
that on Earth separate
from the heavenly realm,
there's no ultimate purpose to this.
But interestingly, at the
very end of Ecclesiastes,
there's this passage where someone is,
I mean, we've heard the
teacher speak, Qoheleth.
We've heard this teacher speak
and talk about how
meaningless everything is.
And then at the end there's
a commentary on this
teacher's sort of treatise.
And it says that everything
he said was upright and true.
Everything he said was
correct essentially.
But the solution is this,
fear God and keep his commandments.
And there's no explanation as to why
that would solve the problem.
There's no like mechanism as
to what that would change.
The most interesting thing
is that it seems to suggest
that everything that this
guy was saying was true,
that it is all just wind.
But that somehow by just fearing God
and keeping his commandments,
you have somehow solved the problem.
I don't think that that's
a very satisfying solution.
But then I think that
that is the great theme
of nihilistic literature.
People try for a kind of solution,
but ultimately, for me at least,
they seem relatively unsatisfying.
Fast forward thousands of years
and you get Albert Camus'
"Myth of Sisyphus,"
which famously ends with this idea
of imagining Sisyphus happy.
Maybe that does it for you.
I don't know what it does for me.
But yeah, Nietzsche is often
associated with nihilism.
Not a nihilist himself, of course,
but discusses a lot of nihilistic themes.
And then the existentialists
are the sort of go-to figures
for discussions of modern nihilism.
In fact, Camus is
celebrated for the starkness
of the opening line of
the "Myth of Sisyphus,"
that "there is one serious
philosophical question,
and that is suicide."
Because everything else, you know,
how many dimensions there are to space,
whether abstract numbers exist,
all of that is secondary.
The most foundational
question is whether or not
you're going to, as he once put it,
have a cup of coffee
or kill yourself today.
Those are kind of your options.
So nihilistic literature, so to speak,
is a broad span.
But literally I think it begins with,
I think that the term is popularized
by Turgenev's novel "Fathers and Sons."
Although that's a more, I think,
that's a more restricted
use of the word nihilism.
It's more culturally relevant to Russia,
the Russia that he was living in.
But that's sort of where
we get the term from.
And it's in novelistic form.
Interestingly, this often
shows up in narrative,
even in the book of Ecclesiastes
it's sort of telling a story.
I mean, broadly speaking,
most people will know,
there's this distinction
between the so-called analytic
philosophy, the if p then q,
and logical fallacy and modus ponens.
And on the other side
you've got the so-called
continental philosophy,
which is more narrative,
it's more poetry, it's
more grasping at ideas
but not directly.
So this is where you
have your existentialists
but also your novelists.
You have your Dostoevsky
and your and your Tolstoys,
and you have your poets.
And that's all sort of on that side.
And the nihilistic literature,
at least the stuff that people care about,
is almost exclusively
on the continental side
because it does seem to be something that
resists discussion in abstract terms.
It's very personal, it's very narrative.
And it involves, you need
to sort of involve yourself
in the story of life in
order to even understand
what the problem is.
I mean, you can imagine
speaking to an alien.
If you sort of tried to
describe to an alien or an AI
what nihilism is, and you say like,
"Well, the problem is I
get up and I go to work,
and I just don't know why I do it."
And the alien might be
like, "Well, yeah, you do.
You do it to get money and to get a job."
"Yeah, but like, why do I do that?"
"Well, because otherwise
you'd be on the street
and you'd be suffering."
"But why?"
"Well, you just it's just built into your,
you don't like suffering.
That's like a definition of suffering.
You just don't like suffering
and you're trying to avoid it."
"Yeah, you're right.
But it's just sort of, there's something,
gosh, I just wish there
was more, you know?"
The alien's like, "What do you mean?
More what? Like more pleasure?"
"No, not more pleasure, just like,
I wish there were like a reason."
It'd be actually quite difficult
to just explain in plain terms.
It's almost like it's a problem
that can only be understood
by someone who lives it.
Whereas you could easily
explain to that alien
the concept of modus ponens.
the alien probably wouldn't
have a problem with that
as long as it's got a rational mind.
But nihilism is something that we need
to experience ourselves and
explore through narrative.
I am brutally agnostic
about almost everything.
And in fact, if somebody ever asks me
how I might console myself in the face
of these existential woes,
genuinely, at least personally,
it is in agnosticism.
It's in the fact that I do not
know the first thing about,
about why any of this exists.
Of course, I don't, you know?
And sometimes people ask me
in a context on a podcast
on a stage or something
implicitly as if I'm
going to have some answer,
as if I've like worked it out
and I'm going to be able to
communicate that to people.
Like, there's just no way.
This is obviously a deeply personal story
that everybody has to live individually.
And I'm like doing the same thing, right?
And I'm interested in philosophy.
So I might have read something
that helps to elucidate a concept,
or I might be able to
put a word on something
that you've been thinking but didn't know
was also thought by other people.
But we're doing the same thing here.
And ultimately I have absolutely no idea
what the ultimate answers are.
And so that kind of consoles me.
Because like if you are
a more certain nihilist,
I can understand why that
would be very upsetting.
If you really just believe
that there's no meaning
to any of this, then I can see why
that would cause you some trouble.
But personally, that's just not something
that I strongly believe.
I think it's plausible.
I think there's a lot of, like,
it's quite an attractive
view in many respects.
You look at the level of suffering
of animals in the history of the world.
When you look at the seeming arbitrariness
of the world around us, the
way that the environment
and the organisms within
it seem to just sort of
almost randomly evolve according
to literal just battles
for survival, it all just
seems a little bit like
this is all just
accidental and meaningless.
But then on a more fundamental level,
it just seems strange to suggest
that it's all just happening
for literally no reason.
That seems implausible to me too.
So I don't really know how
to fully make sense of that.
And that consoles me.
It's the same on the religious question.
It's much easier to be consoled.
I mean, if you believe in
God, you might be terrified
because you're constantly
worried about going to hell.
If you're an atheist,
you might be terrified
because you think that
this is the only life
you have and that it's
ultimately meaningless.
If you're somewhere in the middle,
you kind of just feel like
you'll cross that bridge when
you come to it, you know?
Like nihilism is an upsetting
thing to think about.
It's a sad, it would be a sad reality.
And so if you're certain of it,
if you really are convinced
that that's the case,
I can see why that would
be quite upsetting.
Agnosticism literally does just...
It's not like I'm
choosing to be an agnostic
in order to console myself.
I just genuinely don't know
what the truth of the matter is,
and that just doesn't allow
me to get really upset.
It's almost like,
it's almost like I don't know
if it's going to rain on my wedding day.
It's like, so long as I
have no real conviction
that it is going to rain,
it's gonna be very difficult
for me to get like upset about the rain
spoiling my wedding day, right?
Like I literally just
can't be upset about that
unless I've got some reason to think
that it's going to happen.
Of course, there's literal
reason to think this,
it's plausible that it will
rain on my wedding day,
but that's not quite enough.
You have to actually be convicted of it
in order to be upset by it.
And I suppose I'm just
not convicted of nihilism,
but that's not to say
that I think it's false,
it's just to say that there's
a lot of room for doubt there.
A lot of people don't realize the extent
to which their emotions are
influencing their thinking.
Everybody likes to think that
they're thinking objectively
and rationally and with a sober mind,
but our minds are never
sober from emotion.
And so when you sort of
develop a philosophical view,
it's always gonna be informed
by the way that you feel.
So a lot of people think,
"I'm depressed because I'm an nihilist."
But I think without realizing it,
a lot of the time is actually the case
that people are nihilists
because they're depressed.
It goes the other way around.
Nobody is ever convinced, like,
out of nowhere of a
philosophical position, right?
Like you read a philosopher,
and they will put something in
such a way that makes you go,
"Huh, yeah, you know what,
I think that makes sense."
And that's usually
because they are kind of
putting something into words
or systematizing something
which you already kind of knew.
In fact, if you open
Wittgenstein's "Tractatus,"
the very first line of the introduction,
it says something like,
"This book will be
completely useless to anybody
who doesn't already
agree with his contents."
He just admits that the reason
he's really writing this
is to elucidate something that hopefully
his readers had already kind
of independently come to.
I think that happens all
the time, which is also why,
by the way, if you've ever
tried to get into philosophy,
you might look up like
the 50 greatest philosophers of all time.
I'm really interested. I
wanna see what I can learn.
And it will say, "Okay,
well one great philosopher
is Jean Paul Sartre."
And say, "Okay, I'll give that a go,"
and you pick it up and you read it,
and you're just like, "I don't get it.
I don't understand, not
only do I not understand
the context, like even when
I looked at the SparkNotes
and I got what he was
talking about and all,
it just doesn't make sense to me.
I'm not impressed, like
why is this so famous?"
And it's because you've just
plucked it out of nowhere.
Whereas if you've had like
a million conversations
with people and Jean Paul Sartre is a name
that has come up every now and again,
such that you've heard of him
and such that just because it's so happens
that you are in like conversations
and you are in situations
that suited his name coming up from people
who know who he is, chances
are that if you then go
and read him, you are
actually going to enjoy
what he's saying because
there's some reason
he keeps coming up.
So when people ask me for a recommendation
of what to read philosophically,
I literally tell them to just
read what they've heard of,
because there's a reason why you've heard
of those philosophers,
because they're the people
who've come up in the kind of context
that you are obviously
already interested in.
And I think it's important
to recognize that
you're not gonna be convinced
out of nowhere of a philosophy
that you don't already
have sort of one foot in.
And so for that reason, I
think that our predisposition
towards the world will influence
the kind of philosophies
which are attracted to us.
I mean, I like all of the
nihilistic literature,
all of the famous existential
nihilistic literature,
if you handed that to
a confident Christian,
they're not gonna be convinced by it.
If you hand it to somebody
who hasn't really thought
about the issue, but maybe has some sort
of nihilistic undertones to
their life, they might read that
and go, "Yeah, he's got a point," right?
It's sort of, it's going
to be more attractive
if you are already kind of attracted to it
before you've interacted with the text.
I do think it's not just that.
I mean, I just think
it's worth pointing out
that any kind of radical abandonment
of philosophical consolation and principle
is going to bring with it distress.
But it's not just that,
because nihilism is also
just quite a upsetting
thing for a lot of people.
Like, I mean, it is nicer
to think that you are here
for some kind of reason
that's written into the rules
of the universe and that
it all is just a happy
or unhappy accident.
I think it's just a
nicer kind of philosophy.
But I think we ought be more
suspicious of philosophies
which are more attractive to us,
not because they're
less likely to be true,
but because we are more
likely to accept them
on less evidence because
we want them to be true.
And so I think we need to recognize
that bias and be careful of it.
But it does also seem
completely bewildering
that we would just exist
for absolutely no reason.
I mean, the nihilist
ultimately has to posit that
there is either no
reason for our existence,
which seems completely ludicrous.
There needs to literally be
a reason why things exist.
Or that there is some kind of reason,
but it's completely arbitrary,
which also just seems a bit bewildering.
I mean, whatever is the
answer to the grand mystery
of why anything exists at all,
it seems a little
unsatisfying philosophically
to say that it just could
have gone the other way
and they could have just been nothing.
It seems a little, well, on the surface,
it seems a little implausible.
And so there is an inherent
implausibility to nihilism too
that people will wrestle with.
And whether you are more convinced
by the implausibility of meaning in life
or the implausibility
of it all just happening
for no reason I think will ultimately
depend on your emotional state.
- [Narrator] Chapter 3: How
emotivism shapes ethics.
- Emotivism is an ethical theory.
It's also a theory of language really,
but it belongs in this discussion around
what is good and what is bad.
Broadly speaking, people might be familiar
that when it comes to morals,
what's good and what's bad,
there are kind of two schools.
You have the objective who think
that there are things
which are good and bad,
whether you like it or not.
And there are the subjectivists
who say it's kind of
just all your opinion.
It's your preference.
Some people like murder,
some people don't,
in the way that some people like cake
and some people don't, right?
Emotivism is more on this subjective side,
but emotivism is something
a little different.
It suggests that when people
make ethical statements,
what they're doing is
expressing an emotion.
When you say that murder is wrong,
you are literally expressing
an emotional state towards murder.
That sounds very similar to subjectivism.
In the subjectivist framework,
the phrase "Murder is wrong"
translates to something like,
"I don't like murder."
A phrase like, "I don't like murder"
is a claim about my psychology.
I could be lying. I could
say I don't like murder.
But actually I do secretly like murder.
It could be something
that I'm lying about.
It could be true, it could be false
that I don't like murder.
It seems to be a claim about
my brain, about my psychology,
about my attitude towards murder.
Emotivism is not that.
It's not the reporting of an
emotional state or an attitude.
It is literally the
expression of that attitude.
It's the difference between telling you,
"I don't like murder,"
and literally going like,
"Ugh, murder," or just
like pulling a nasty face.
Or as A.J. Ayer's famously had it going,
"Boo, boo murder," right?
The emotivist thinks that
that is what's going on
when we say murder is wrong,
meaning that these ethical
claims are literally
not the kind of thing
that can be true or false.
There are some kinds of
expressions and statements
that have what's called truth value.
Truth value means that
it can be true or false.
So a statement like the
sky is red has truth value,
it's just that the truth value is false.
Whereas some statements
like commands, for example,
"Go over there," it
doesn't have truth value.
It's not the kind of thing
that can be true or false.
A phrase like, "I don't
like murder" could be true.
A phrase like the objectivist theory
that murder is wrong might be true,
but for the emotivist,
it's literally like going,
"Boo, murder," which isn't true.
It isn't false, it's just an expression.
It's the same as me kicking my foot
and going, "Ow."
Is that true? Is it false?
Am I lying? Like that kind
of doesn't apply here.
You're just expressing something.
That's what the emotivist believes anyway,
that's the broad position of emotivism.
It belongs in this category of
non-cognitivism about ethics,
which means that these statements
don't have truth value.
There are cognitivists who
think that ethical statements
have truth value and non-cognitivists
who think that they don't.
And emotivism is a form
of non-cognitivism.
So for example, another
non-cognitivist school
is prescriptivism, which
thinks that ethical statements
are essentially commands.
When I say murder is wrong,
what I mean is something like,
"Don't murder."
That's like the kind of
statement that I'm saying.
So it's not exactly expressing an emotion,
it's giving a command, but
it's also non-cognitivist
because it doesn't have truth value.
You're just sort of saying something
that isn't true or false.
Reasoning can be connected
to ethical statements
on an emotivist framework.
There is this idea that
if we're emotivists,
then suddenly the possibility
for all disagreement
on moral issues vanishes.
Because how can you have a
debate if there's no truth value?
And that's true to a degree,
and I understand the criticism.
It's not so much a
criticism as an observation.
It might just be true
that we can't do that,
but a lot of people aren't
satisfied with that.
But it's way more restricted
than people realize.
A.J. Ayer pointed out in
"Language, Truth & Logic,"
he sort of is the founder
of this emotivist school.
He points out that the vast
majority of moral debate
is not moral debate at all.
It's debate about descriptive facts
that we then apply our sort
of moral intuitions to.
So for example, if you imagine
a debate about guns in America
and people are having a back and forth.
And one person says, "Well, did you know
that if we criminalize guns,
it would reduce the number
of gun-related deaths by 10,000 a year?
And another person says, "Ah, yeah,
but did you know that you
haven't taken into account
this statistic that if you get
rid of good people with guns,
then less people will be saved?"
And then someone says,
"Oh, but did you know
that swimming pools kill
more children than guns do?"
This is the kind of debate that
we're having back and forth.
But none of those claims are moral claims.
They're just descriptive, factual claims,
they're statistics, you
can go and test them.
It's either true or false, right?
Like a lot of what we
think is moral debate
is actually just debate
about descriptive facts,
which once those are settled,
we then apply our moral intuitions to.
So for example, in the gun debate,
one person has one moral view
and another person has another moral view,
and they're battling it out.
But actually they might
have the same moral view,
so to speak.
For the emotivist, it's some
kind of emotional expression.
And so what might be the
emotional expression?
Well, suppose one person says,
"If we allow guns in society,
innocent people are going to die."
And another person says,
"But, like, if we don't
allow guns in society,
then only the bad guys
are gonna have guns,
and they're gonna kill innocent people,
and there's gonna be
no one to protect them,
so innocent people will die."
Both of them agree,
innocent people dying, boo.
And what they're debating is a descriptive
like truth of of the matter
as to whether, literally
speaking, more guns, less guns,
more deaths, less deaths, right?
And so the idea that
instantly comes to mind
is that we can't have any
kind of reasonable discussion
about moral issues, like it's true,
but I just wanna point out
that it's way more restricted.
It's not like you can't have
this kind of gun discussion.
You can't have a discussion about,
I don't know about
abortion and healthcare.
And you can't talk about, I don't know,
pick another pet moral
issue, speed limits.
You know, like how can we
have a moral discussion
about speed limits?
Well, we can talk about
how many people will die,
the statistics about
increasing by 10 miles an hour
and all this kind, that's all just facts.
And then we'll apply our moral intuitions.
And I think that when
we actually break down
and isolate the moral element alone,
we'll find that there is
actually a lot more agreement
than there is disagreement.
That doesn't do away with the problem.
The challenge is like what if
there really is disagreement
on the moral stuff?
What if two people genuinely just have
conflicting boos and yays?
And in that case, there
are sort of two strategies.
You either say, "Well, if you really broke
those down further, you'd
realize that everybody
ultimately has the same
emotional, like, expression
on fundamental ethical issues.
Because we're all human,
we all have a shared
evolutionary heritage that will have
placed within us certain
emotional predispositions,
that ultimately will be the same
if we just break them down far enough."
The other strategy is to
say, "No, people do just have
fundamental value conflicts.
And that's just true. And
that's just the way it is.
And there's nothing we can do about it."
Whichever of those you find
plausible is up to you.
But obviously the former is a bit more
of an optimistic idea.
I think people will be
more attracted to that
because it allows us to sort
of say, "Well, everybody agrees
that boo innocent people dying,
and so we can just in
accordance with that."
But it seems more likely the
case that that's not true.
I mean, on that point, it's quite clear
that there are people who
do not have an adverse
emotional reaction to
innocent people dying.
And so that can't be the most foundational
ethical principle that we all agree on.
But it might go deeper than that.
It might be, that's not foundational.
Innocent people dying cannot be
a foundational ethical expression,
because it contains too many concepts.
The concept of innocent,
the concept of death.
The reason why you might think,
the reason why you might
have that emotional reaction
to innocent people dying,
it can be broken down much, much further.
If somebody thinks that their
fundamental ethical principle
is innocent people dying, boo,
I can think of 10 situations
off the top of my head
in which you would be perfectly fine
with an innocent person dying.
It can't be that. It
must go deeper than that.
And it might genuinely be
that if you actually go
deep enough into people's moral emotions,
they will ultimately outroot the identical
across the human species.
And that at a higher level,
when someone has an emotional
reaction to something,
that emotional reaction,
you can't say it's wrong
because there's no truth value,
but you could say that
it betrays a mistake
that somebody has made.
This is really interesting.
Like, suppose you were really upset
because it was raining
on your wedding day.
But it turned out it
wasn't actually raining.
You'd been accidentally
watching a tape recording
of the news forecast, right?
And you believed it was raining,
and you're really upset about it.
And I come over to you and I say,
"Hey, it's not actually raining, right?"
And suddenly you are happy again.
Those emotional states,
the sadness that the rain
and the happiness that it's not raining,
they're just emotional states, right?
They're not true. They're not false.
They're literally just
expressions of emotion.
But I can still come in
and give you information
that will change your emotional state
and literally convince you
to sort of feel the opposite way
just based on the information
that I've just given you.
So in the same way it
might be that people have,
so to speak, mistakes in their
like emotional expressions
at a higher level, right?
In the same way that you might
be sad that it's raining,
even though it's not really raining,
somebody might have an emotional reaction
to a surface-level moral issue.
They might be like,
"Oh, I think it's wrong
that that gun law passed."
But if you actually just
explain to the facts to them,
they might be like,
"Actually, yeah, fair enough.
No, I think it's good
that that gun law passed."
So you are sort of having this
what looks like rational
discussion about moral issues,
but all you're actually doing
is discussing the facts.
And it might be the case
that if we actually made
every human being on earth
consistent internally,
emotionally with all of their foundational
emotional motivations, that there would be
a lot more unity than disunity.
But we don't know, because, of course,
that experiment has not and
probably cannot ever be done.
I'm not sure there is a distinction
between emotions and attitudes.
I think these are essentially synonyms.
Simon Blackburn disagrees
with me about this.
He is an important metaethicist.
He founded a metaethical position,
which he equals quasi-realism,
which is a kind of
non-cognitivism about ethics.
But he thinks that, for example,
you can have an attitude towards something
without having an emotional state,
like, or being in an emotional state
with relation to that thing.
So you might have an attitude
that that thing is bad
or that you shouldn't do
that or something like that.
But it doesn't mean that you're
like emotionally invested.
I'm just not sure that that's possible.
I think that to have an
attitude towards something
is kind of, literally speaking,
to have a way that you prefer it to be.
And I think that that belongs
in the category of emotion.
But this is essentially semantics.
Like if you want to
draw out a distinction,
you could probably do it and say that
an attitude towards something is
something like your desire for the way
that you want it to be.
Whereas your emotional
state is the reaction
you have to it not being
the way you want it to be.
Yeah, you could draw out
some distinction like that,
but I think that in practice
we're kind of talking
about the same thing.
One thing that's important to point out
is a mistake that people make.
Emotivists don't think
that wrongness or badness
or something that maps on
to a preexisting emotion,
like disgust or like anger or upset.
It just belongs in that category,
but it's its own unique emotion,
in the same way that anger
is a little bit like sadness,
but they're not the same thing.
They just belong in the same category.
They're just two unique kinds of emotions.
Wrong is its own kind of emotion.
It's unique, but it's
still an emotion, you know?
It just belongs in that category.
So well, why might we think that?
Well, how do people talk about ethics?
Okay, we talk about things being wrong,
but when someone does
something absolutely awful,
like really, really bad, what do we say?
"Disgusting."
You say, "That's just disgusting.
It's despicable."
And the sort of emotional reaction
just comes up in your face.
Now, some people will say
that that emotional reaction
is your reaction to the wrongness, right?
There is this objective wrongness
and you are having this
reaction of disgust
to the wrongness.
I'm more inclined to
say that the wrongness
in its totality is the feeling of disgust.
A great example for emotivism
is the incest taboo.
It's the most universal taboo
that exists in human societies.
Everywhere we look,
there is a prohibition
against any kind of marital
or sexual relation with
your immediate family.
Some tribes, I think, found
have some interesting variants
whereby, like, you can
marry your older sister
but not your younger
sister, stuff like that.
But across the board there
is some kind of incest taboo.
It's quite easy to explain evolutionarily
why this is the case.
Like, clearly there are
all kinds of problems
with inbreeding that
will be evolutionarily
deselected for, right?
But evolutionary explanations
aren't a justification, right?
Like I can also evolutionarily explain
why people tend to be a bit racist.
I can explain that in terms
of your evolutionary biology,
but that wouldn't be a
justification for racism.
That would just be an
explanation for it, right?
So I can explain why there
is this incest taboo,
but most people want to
say that incest is wrong.
Why?
It's a famously difficult thing for any,
at least secular ethicist, to do,
especially if you're
some kind of utilitarian
who thinks that the
only thing that matters
is the minimization of suffering.
"Oh, well it's because you
can have disabled children."
Few questions jump out of that for me.
Firstly, what's wrong with
having disabled children?
Secondly, obviously you can
control for these factors.
Okay, so you make sure
that it's two women,
or it's two men who've been sterilized
or something like that.
Or a man and a woman who've
been sterilized or two men.
"Okay, well then it's
about the power imbalances
in a family that," okay,
we'll just control for that.
Like, it's so often we waste so much time
on these irrelevant factors.
You can literally just
control for these factors.
What's wrong with it?
When it comes down to it, most people,
if they search their inner experience,
will either, I mean, the sort
of enlightened rationalists
will go, "Well then, I don't
think it is wrong, you know?"
And okay, maybe they're right
in being consistent there,
but even such people tend to still feel
uncomfortable with it.
Somebody actually once put
me through my paces on this,
because I used to be
a bit of a utilitarian
and I used to talk about this and say,
"Well, I suppose like I can't see anything
that's subjectively wrong with that."
And someone I know like pretended
that his new girlfriend,
he like introduced her to me
as like his cousin or something.
And then like later on it became clear
that they were an item, and
he was just toying with me
to see how I'd actually react.
Because it's easy to say, "Oh yeah,
there's nothing wrong with that,"
but you're still gonna be like, "What?"
because it's so universal.
So what's going on there?
We just think it's disgusting.
We're just like, "Gosh, no.
I mean, that's your
brother, that's your sister,
that's your mother."
It's like that's all
you've got, ultimately,
when you break it down.
There will be people who say, "No, like,
I believe in God and God has
enshrined into the moral law
of the universe that this is wrong."
Interestingly, still doesn't
tell you why it's wrong,
just gives you confidence that it's wrong.
But fine, shelving that at
least for the time being,
like for at least the
secular ethicist among us,
like even secular ethicists will say,
"No, emotivism is wrong."
Okay, well then try to account
for what's going on here.
Maybe you will just say that in this case
people are just having
an emotional reaction,
and for that reason it's not wrong.
But I think that's just what's
going on across the board.
Think about the worst,
most homophobic person
you've ever met.
What do they say about gay people?
They don't just say abstractly,
like completely dispassionately,
"I think that is immoral."
They say, "It's disgusting.
It's disgusting. No, no.
No son of mine will be gay, no, no."
It's got this emotional
component that everybody knows.
Everybody knows about
this emotional component
that these things have,
but I think there is
just the emotional component.
I think that's what this ethics is.
That is the difference
between a father saying,
"My son is gay," as a matter of fact,
and saying, "It's wrong
that my son is gay."
I think if you isolate
what the difference is
between those two statements
is that, in one case,
he's feeling something in relation
to that fact about the world.
And it's not like another
fact that he's adding on.
There's only one fact there,
which is that his son is gay,
and the only thing that's being added on
in saying that it's
wrong that his son is gay
is how he feels about it.
You might remember that I
said that emotivism is a,
it's a theory about ethics,
but really it's a theory
about language, right?
It's more about what people mean
when they say particular words.
And so to say that,
when someone says like, "The
world ought to be this way,"
what they're doing is they're expressing
an emotional state about the world.
They're expressing their
emotional reaction to the world,
that they don't like it.
And you can still make sense
of what's like going on there.
It's kind of like if we
were looking for some food
and I said, "Let's go to Wetherspoons."
I don't know if you know
what a Wetherspoons is,
but it's a glorious pub
chain in the United Kingdom.
And you looked on your phone and said,
"Oh, they're all shut."
And I went, "Ugh, God's sake."
Like I'm expressing a preference
about how I wish the world were, you know?
And crucially, I'm not
just reporting this,
I'm not just saying, "You know,
I wish we lived in a world
where Wetherspoons were open all night."
That would just be a fact
about my psychological state.
It's the expression itself.
And I think that if I said something like,
"It's just so wrong that they shut early,"
or something like that, I
use these moralizing terms,
that what I'd be doing
is expressing an emotion.
So you can still say something like,
"The world really ought not be that way,"
but the emotivist is just translates
that language into the
language of ethical expression
in the same way that like, I don't know,
you might translate when...
A lot of the time in like
relationships with people,
you kind of have to translate
what they're saying.
If your wife says to you
like, "Oh, you're back
10 minutes later than you said you'd be."
What she's actually saying is,
"Stop taking me for a fool.
Like, you're lying to me
and you're never on time
and you're lazy."
But it's sort of this,
there's something more
going on under the surface.
It might even be a kind
of expression of emotion.
When she says, "Oh, well, oh
no, it's just that I thought
we could maybe get
dinner together tonight."
On the surface, she's
making a descriptive claim
about her psychology.
"I'm just reporting to you,
I thought, I had a belief
that we were gonna get dinner."
That's just a fact about the world.
But clearly what she's
actually doing there
is expressing an emotional state to you.
She's expressing her upset,
but she's sort of disguising
it in the language
of truth claims about
her psychology, right?
And the same thing's going on with ethics.
When someone says, "I think that's wrong,"
what they're doing is
having an emotional reaction
to something and putting it
into descriptive clothing.
I was always already just
deeply suspicious of the idea
that ethics is this...
It's a very difficult
thing to define famously,
like, concepts, like good and bad,
but we employ them all the time.
Like, outside of this
kind of conversation,
if I'm a bit late to this
interview, and somebody says,
"Oh, I just think that that's really bad,
that's really immoral that you were late,"
like without doing any metaethic,
we all kind of get what's
being said there, right?
Technically speaking, if I
asked everybody in this room,
"Well, what's your
definition of wrongness?
What does that literally mean?
Do you mean that it causes suffering?
Do you mean that it..."
Like, people might have
different views and whatnot,
but like on the surface level,
we all sort of use these
terms and we kind of get along
using these terms and
we know what they mean.
So I was just interested in the fact
that it's a kind of lexicon
that I was already frequently employing,
but also deeply suspicious of the idea
that there is this thing in the universe
called like goodness.
It just like where does it
exist? How does it exist?
Does it exist, like in people, in actions?
Like, can something even
exists within an act?
Like where is it? What is it, you know?
It's like, "Okay, well then
let's start paying attention."
I mean, this is not an uncommon thought
for people to realize that
the this good and bad stuff
is essentially just, it's
just people saying stuff.
It's just like viewpoints
and subjective preferences.
All right, but let's get more specific.
What exactly am I saying?
Because I use these terms.
It's not like I'm using a term
without knowing what it means.
It's not like I've just
used the word obnoxious,
but not known the definition of obnoxious.
I know what I mean when
I say these terms, right?
But when I reflect on it, right?
"But what is this, this good, this bad?
I must mean something. So what do I mean?"
And that's when I sort of do this exercise
of really trying to
isolate the moral element.
What is the difference between
it's raining and it's
bad that it's raining?
What is the difference
between a murder just occurred
and it's wrong that that
murder just occurred?
If you try to isolate what the
actual difference is there,
I think it has to just be an attitude,
it's an expression, it's the way you feel
about that particular situation.
And so the only thing that
can be added by saying
that something is wrong is the
expression of that attitude.
That's sort of the way
of thinking about it.
That led me to emotivism.
I think it is hard to remember literally
how I sort of first started
becoming convinced by this,
but I suppose I was
convinced that there is
no objective good or bad.
I couldn't even make
sense of such a concept.
And once that's gone, it's
not even like you're really
doing ethics anymore.
Now you're just trying to work out,
"Okay, then what do those words mean?
What is the referent for the word good?"
It can't be literally meaningless.
It must have some kind of referent.
That's what led A.J. Ayer
to it in the first place.
He had this whole philosophy
about meaning in language.
He thought that like statements
could only be meaningful
if they were either
something you could verify,
so prove or disprove through
empirical observation,
or if they were just
like analytically true,
just true by definition,
things like two plus two is
four, something like that.
Or analytically false, you
know, two plus two is five.
It's a meaningful statement.
It's just meaningfully false.
This philosophy, by the
way, has completely fallen
out of favor, this logical
positivism, as it's called,
this idea that statements
are only meaningful
if they are verifiable or analytical,
or analytically true or false,
which means that any kind
of statement which does not
belong in that category...
It's not just that it's
like wrong or false.
Ayer thought it was literally meaningless.
It was the same as just like going,
"Blah, blah, blah," or something.
It just literally had no meaning.
And so the big problem in chapter seven
of "Language, Truth & Logic"
is what about ethical statements?
When I say murder is wrong,
it doesn't seem like it's something
I can empirically verify.
I can't go out and like test
with scientific experiments
whether murder is wrong,
but it also doesn't
seem analytically true.
It doesn't seem true by definition.
It seems like I can meaningfully ask,
is murder really wrong?
And so Ayer's philosophy
led him to this position
where he either had to say
that ethical statements
were therefore literally meaningless,
again, like saying murder
is wrong would be the same
as just saying like,
murder is blah, blah, blah.
Like, just meaningless statement.
But Ayer was like, "No, it
definitely means something."
So if it's not analytically true
and it's not empirically verifiable,
then what do these
ethical statements mean?
Oh, well, they're expressions of emotions.
They're not the kind of
things that are true and false
that we can test like scientifically
or might be analytically true.
It's not in the realm
of truth value at all.
It's literally just an
emotional expression.
So it's meaningful in that sense,
in a slightly different sense
that the literal meaning
of the expression is
just that an expression.
The biggest problem for
emotivism is this so-called
Frege-Geach problem, named
after two philosophers.
It's also known as the embedding problem.
Reason for that is because
it deals with this problem
that, when you take the meaning
of a word or a statement
and you embed it in the English language
into a larger sentence, the
meaning needs to stay the same.
So if I say, "It's raining outside,"
and then I say something like,
"I wonder if it's raining outside,"
so I've embedded that phrase,
"it's raining outside"
that atomic phrase
inside a larger sentence,
that isolated element of
"it's raining outside"
has to mean the same thing.
I'm now saying, "I wonder
if it's raining outside,"
and then "it's raining outside."
Well, "I think that it's raining outside."
Or, "If it's raining outside,
then I will bring an umbrella," right?
Like those statements, "I
will bring an umbrella"
and, "it's raining outside"
have meaning of their own,
and they retain that
meaning when you embed them
into a statement, like,
"if it's raining outside,
then I'll bring an umbrella."
The problem for Frege and Geach
is that with emotivism,
if ethical statements
are just expressions of emotion,
that is, when I say murder is wrong,
I literally mean something
like boo, murder.
Then how can I make sense
of a statement like,
"I wonder if murder is wrong."
Like, what does that statement
mean when someone says that?
Because if murder is wrong,
just means boo, murder,
that would mean someone saying,
"I wonder if boo, murder."
That doesn't make very much sense
because you are expressing an emotion
and then saying, "I wonder."
It's almost like you
stub your toe and you go,
"I wonder if, ah, man."
It doesn't make sense.
That's not the kind of...
The only way you could make
sense of someone saying
"I wonder if murder is
wrong," is if in that context,
in the embedded context,
murder is wrong means something different.
In that context, it means it's
not an expression of emotion.
Oh, it's a discussion
about their mental attitude
or something like that.
But meaning doesn't just
change like that for sentences.
And so the embedding problem
says, "Well, if you look
at a statement like, 'I
wonder if murder is wrong'
or if murder is wrong, then
murdering James is wrong,"
which seems to be a sensible statement
that I can make sense of,
then given that in that embedded context,
those statements can't just
be expressions of emotion,
means that outside of
those embedded context,
they also can't just be
expressions of emotions.
It's a bit of a technical problem.
I hope that kind of makes sense.
It's a little bit difficult
to explain actually,
but I think hopefully that comes across.
And people can do further reading on this,
but I mean, if you think
about an argument like,
if murder is wrong, then
murdering James is wrong.
Premise two, murder is wrong,
conclusion, therefore,
murdering James is wrong.
That conclusion follows
from those premises.
We don't know if the premises are true,
but we can say that if
the premises are true,
the conclusion follows.
It's a valid argument.
But logical validity
relies on the truth value of the premises.
To say that an argument is valid is to say
that if the premises are
true, the conclusion is true.
Right? That's what it means
to say an argument is valid.
That's like the definition
of a valid argument.
So if we take that argument,
if murder is wrong, then
murdering James is wrong,
premise two, murder is wrong,
it follows that murdering James is wrong.
That seems valid, but that would require
us being able to conceive of
premise two, murder is wrong,
as being something which is true or false.
If we're an emotivist
and we say, "No, no, no,
that's an expression of emotion,
it can't be true or false,"
then we'd have to say that that argument
that I just laid out is not valid.
That doesn't seem right.
Seems perfectly valid.
I mean, it has to be valid.
Surely if you see it written down,
it's like that's obviously,
the conclusion obviously
follows from the premises.
So it's as though when you
take these ethical expressions
and you embed them into bigger contexts
like syllogisms or "I
wonder if," or whatever,
if-then statements, that
suddenly they're what,
like just not emotional
expressions anymore?
Suddenly they have truth value
and we talk about them differently.
That doesn't seem to make any sense.
So that's the Frege-Geach problem.
If you're interested in emotivism,
the place to start might be A.J. Ayer's
"Language, Truth & Logic,"
which is where this
all kind of comes from.
It's chapter seven in which he talks
about what it means to use moral terms.
Like the book as a whole explains
his logical positivism as a philosophy,
which like I say, no one
really believes in anymore.
It was kind of popular for
a while in the 20th century
and then just completely
fell out of favor.
But that chapter seven is still the origin
of this emotivist framework.
But a more modern philosopher
to read on this stuff
would be Simon Blackburn, I think.
Blackburn is famous for his
introductions to philosophy.
He's written a few sort
of popular introductions
for just getting into philosophy.
But he's also done some
important work in metaethics.
He's not himself an emotivist,
but he's written
compellingly about emotivism
and non-cognitivism more broadly.
He's also compiled or constructed
quite an influential response
to the best objection to emotivism.
Those would be the two
names that jump out at me
to begin exploring emotivism.
