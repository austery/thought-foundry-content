In research at OpenAI, which is around slightly less than 600 people at the moment, everyone knows everything. We are extremely internally transparent when in research. The culture generally is very collaborative. It is a very positive sum game. The success of OpenAI is far from guaranteed. There is a lot of feeling of... shared faiths and the fact that we all need to rely on each other to do our job to achieve this shared mission. There truly will happen some complaints that are just a little bit unnecessary. But if you are not afraid to say that this is bad or that is bad, then you are a little bit closer to the truth and a little bit closer to identifying things that you actually should improve and should do better.
