- Imagine you are in empty space
and you fire off a stream of electrons.
Well then according to most
physics textbooks, the only way
to change how those electrons behave is
by applying an electric or magnetic
or gravitational force to them.
But most physics textbooks are wrong.
In the 1950s, two physicists came up
with a clever experiment.
You could have electrons
travel through a region
with no electric or
magnetic fields whatsoever,
and yet by flipping a switch,
you could change their behavior.
- The magnetic field could be just zero,
and yet the presence of some
quantity could actually lead
to observable effects. 
That wasn't supposed to happen, right?
- This experiment split the
physics community in two.
It made them question whether
fields are fundamental
or whether something that was supposed
to be just an abstract
mathematical tool was actually more
core to reality.
This tool was first introduced
in an attempt to solve one
of the hardest unsolved
problems in physics.
The three body problem. 
That is, if you have three bodies
and you know their initial positions
and velocities, how
will they move under the
influence of each other's gravity?
- It's a juicy, juicy problem,
which has occupied literally
generations, hundreds
and hundreds of years
of incredibly ambitious,
talented mathematicians,
physicists, and astronomers,
and, and and beyond.
- The fact that this
problem is so difficult
to solve should at least
be a little surprising
because if you have just two bodies,
then the solution is easy to find.
In fact, the general case was
already solved over 300 years
ago by Newton himself.
But when Newton added a third body, well,
that's when everything fell apart.
In the two body case, the
forces behaved predictably,
always pointing toward's the
system's shared center of mass.
But with three bodies,
this is no longer the case.
When you try to calculate the forces,
they end up being extremely dynamic.
In addition to worrying about
the magnitude of the forces,
you also have to worry
about their direction.
So you end up with this
chaotic mess of vectors
for the next hundred years,
everyone who tried to
solve this problem failed.
But what if there was some
other way to approach it, a way
to simplify the math
and not have to worry about
these three dimensional vectors?
Well, that's where Joseph
Louis Lagrange comes in.
In the 1770s, he was also trying
to solve the three body problem,
and he came up with a new approach.
It works something like this.
Say you've got a single mass like a star
Lagrange imagined assigning a value
to each point in space around the star.
The value is determined by the star's mass
and the distance from the star.
You can think of each value as a height,
and if we then turn this into
an altitude map, you can see
how the star creates this sort of well.
What Lagrange had developed
was the gravitational
potential V, and what's
important to note is
that V is a scalar.
It has a magnitude but no direction.
So the genius in Lagrange's idea is this.
At any given point, we can
draw an arrow pointing directly
downhill where the size
of the arrow corresponds
to the steepness of the hill
at that point, we can repeat
this process at every point.
And if we then shift our
perspective to two dimensions,
look, what we've got is the
gravitational field of the star.
Mathematically, we say
that the gravitational field G is equal
to the negative gradient of V.
- So Lagrange had found a
way to switch the problem back
and forth between one of
vectors and one of scalars.
And while adding up vectors is hard,
adding scalars is a piece of cake.
To find the combined potential
landscape of any number
of bodies, you just add up
their individual potentials
and then you can always
use that to get back
to forces if you want.
For a simple two body system
like the earth orbiting the
sun, that combined potential
looks something like this.
If you look closely, you see
that there are five points
where the gradient is zero.
And so Lagrange realized the
forces there are also zero,
which means that at each of these points,
you could place a tiny third body
and it would maintain a
perfectly stable orbit.
That is if it isn't disturbed.
These points are now known
as the Lagrange points.
And while they didn't help
solve the three body problem,
Lagrange was developing
more sophisticated tools.
In fact, he developed an entirely new
way of doing mechanics.
But for that to work, he
didn't just need the potential,
he needed the potential energy
and the kinetic energy too.
I think when people hear potential,
they think potential energy.
And while they're very similar,
there is a subtle difference.
If you have the potential
that's basically the field
corresponding to a single body,
then it will have some
potential field around it,
which is described as
V equals minus GM over
r, where this is the mass of the sun.
But to get the potential energy we need
to add in a second body.
So let's say that's the
earth. The potential energy,
let's call it U,
is basically just the potential times the
mass of the second body.
So they're very similar, but
they're slightly different.
And the kinetic energy
of the earth is simple.
That's of course one half MV squared.
So now we have everything we
need to try this new method.
In fact, we made a whole
video on this over a year ago,
but for now, all we need to know is
that we can write down the
kinetic minus potential energy
to find what's known as the Lagrangian.
Then you sub that into the
so-called Euler-Lagrange equation,
and out comes your solution.
For example, predicting the
motion of a double pendulum
by using this standard forces
approach is infamously hard.
- Because as one pendulum is swinging,
it provides the attachment point
for the pendulum hanging below it.
And so that pendulum is
in this moving reference
frame as it's swinging.
- But if you plug the kinetic
and potential energy into
the Euler-Lagrange equation,
then you can quickly get to a
solution at least numerically.
That's actually how we
made this simulation.
- I remember thinking,
man force is like hard
to get the right answer.
You can do it if you're good,
and people who are good
at mechanics can do it.
But with the Lagrangian approach,
you could just write down the
energy, which is a scalar,
not a vector, plug it into
the Euler-Lagrange equation,
and you get the right equation of motion
and you don't have to be a good physicist.
- But for all its usefulness,
the potential wasn't enough
to help Lagrange solve
the three body problem.
In 1887, mathematician
Heinrich Bruns finally proved
that the three body problem is unsolvable.
There are simply too many unknowns
and no way to simplify the
problem to reduce them.
So the best we've got
are computer simulations,
which compute the potentials
from moment to moment,
and use that to predict how
the system will evolve in time.
- And so that's where we come to realize
that the three body
problem is beautiful for
what it's taught us.
Even though we now recognize
that we can't actually solve
for this exact problem as as
many folks had hoped to do.
And in doing that, they
merely gave us the machinery
of modern mathematical physics.
So I'm pretty happy they tried.
- The potential helped simplify
a wide array of problems.
For many physicists
it even replaced forces
as their primary tool.
It became so useful that people started
to wonder if other forces
in nature might have a
corresponding potential,
starting with the electric force.
- If you look at the formula
for the electric force,
you notice that it's remarkably
similar to that for gravity,
just with masses and charges
swapped.
In the 1810s, Simeon Denis Poisson, 
one of Lagrange's students, also noticed the similarity
and he realized
that you can define an
electric potential phi in a
very similar way.
But there is one important difference,
and that is while two
masses can only attract,
two charges can attract or repel.
So now with the potential
you don't only get pits,
you also get hills.
But one force was much trickier
to find the potential for,
and that was the magnetic force.
And that's because magnetism
is a fundamentally different
beast from the gravitational
and electric force.
Take a bar magnet,
we can draw the magnetic
field it produces.
It looks something like this.
Now at first glance,
this looks very similar
to the electric scenario
where we have a positive
and negative charge,
but this picture doesn't
look at what's going
on inside the magnet.
So if we reveal what's inside
then you see that these
lines actually continue,
but now they point from south to north.
So magnetic field lines
are actually loops.
They don't have an origin or endpoint,
and that fundamentally changes things.
So physicists need a new way
to describe the magnetic potential.
- The breakthrough came in the
1840s from an undergraduate
student named William Thompson.
- His day job as an
undergraduate was to learn
as much fancy calculus as possible.
And then when he learned
that he invented more.
- Thompson found that the
mathematics of his day was unable
to describe the relationship
between a magnetic field
and its associated potential.
So he came up with an
entirely new function, the curl.
To see how this works,
imagine the arrows of
this vector field are
like currents in a liquid.
If we were to place a
paddle wheel right here,
it would start to rotate
rapidly counterclockwise.
As Thompson defined it, this
spot has high positive curl, at
this spot, it would rotate clockwise,
but not as rapidly, so it
has lower negative curl.
And here the current pushes
on it equally in both
directions, so it wouldn't rotate at all.
This spot has zero curl.
Thompson realized
that the magnetic vector
field B could be defined
as the curl of some other vector field,
the magnetic vector potential A.
Now, even though they're both
vector fields, it turns out
that A is often much easier to work
with than the magnetic field itself,
much like the other potentials V and phi,
- Thompson was showing there was a kind
of underlying mathematical
structure one could use
that would streamline the calculations,
but even Thompson thought
this was a kind of device,
a helpful device,
and not a substitute for
like the real physics.
- Decades later, Thompson was
elevated to the House of Lords
for his contributions to science
where he received a
new title, Lord Kelvin,
with Kelvin's latest edition.
There were now three fundamental
equations relating the
potentials to their respective fields.
- Thanks to each of these,
you could now solve problems much easier.
And so ever since professional
physicists often use
potentials instead of forces
or fields to solve the
problems they're working on.
Potentials even show up in some
of our best physical
theories of the universe.
But that raises an important question.
If potentials pop up everywhere,
then do they actually represent
anything physical, that is,
can they have a direct
influence on reality?
Well, to most physicists, the
answer was a resounding no.
Take the gravitational potential
of a single star, for example.
Well, we could just add 10 to
each value of the potential,
and this would shift
the overall landscape.
But the change in landscape from one point
to the next remains the exact same.
So the field is the same
as the one we had before,
and the force and object would
experience at any point would
remain unchanged.
In fact, we can add any constant
10, a hundred, a million,
and the field doesn't change.
And so the forces
an object would experience going
around it also don't change.
There are an infinite number
of ways we could write the
gravitational potential
for any gravitational field
and get the system to
evolve in the same way.
And the same is true for
electricity and magnetism.
The value of the field and
thus the force is fixed,
but the value of the
potential is arbitrary.
So from this, most physicists concluded
that potentials can possibly
have any physical significance.
It must just be a trick
that makes the math easier,
but most physicists might be wrong.
- In 1942, 23-year-old David
Bohm was hard at work on his
thesis in particle physics
when one day he received
an unexpected visit.
- Robert Oppenheimer, who was
David Bohm's PhD advisor, wanted
to bring him squarely onto the new
Manhattan project efforts.
- This was a life-changing opportunity.
Bohm would be working side by side with some
of the top minds in physics,
but there was a problem.
The project's military director
General Leslie Groves had
to approve Oppenheimer's recruits.
And when he ran a background check on B,
he didn't like what he saw.
- He briefly joined the American branch
of the Communist Party
when he was in California
by his own recollections,
he quit pretty quickly
'cause he got bored.
He said, these people just sit around
talking all day and don't do anything.
Even so Groves deemed Bohm a security risk
and banned him from working
on the Manhattan Project.
But things got even worse just
- As he was about to finish
his dissertation in Berkeley,
the topic was then classified.
He did not have clearance,
so he couldn't even work on
or even write up his own dissertation.
So Oppenheimer had to certify
that Bohm had done good work.
And in 1943 in wartime,
that was sufficient for Bohm
to actually get a PhD.
- After the war, Bohm became
an assistant professor at
Princeton University, but
fears surrounding his communist
sympathies followed him wherever he went.
In 1949, he was brought
before the house on American Activities
Committee for questioning.
While Bohm was under investigation,
Princeton let his
professorship lapse, and even
after he was acquitted, the university
refused to reinstate him.
It seemed that Bohm was
destined for obscurity.
And so Oppenheimer gave
him a firm recommendation,
leave the country and
start fresh somewhere else.
Oppenheimer was no stranger
to political persecution,
and he didn't want Bohm
to suffer the same fate.
So Bohm took the advice, his
journeys brought him to Brazil
and then Israel.
And though he was free from
the political pressures he had
felt in America, he still
found himself an outcast.
Many of Bohm's academic peers were put off
by his more unorthodox ideas,
including his radical
interpretation of quantum mechanics
and his new theory of human consciousness.
But there was one student
who was enthralled
by Bohm's approach, and
that was Yakir Aharonov.
- When Bohm relocated once more.
This time, moving to the
University of Bristol in England,
Aharonov chose to come with him,
and it was there in Bristol
in the 1950s that Aharonov
and Bohm stumbled upon something huge.
- According to quantum mechanics,
at the smallest particles
behave like waves,
and this behavior is governed
by the Schrodinger equation.
The solution to this
equation is called the wave
function psi.
If you take its modulus squared,
you get the probability density
of finding a particle at a
given point, at a given time.
The left side of this equation tells you
how the wave function
changes over time and space,
and the right side tells you
that this change depends on hitch,
what is known as the Hamiltonian.
It's basically just the
total energy of the system.
In the case where we have both an electric
and magnetic potential, the solution
to the Schrodinger equation
looks something like this,
where this is just a constant.
And this term describes the complex phase.
It looks complicated,
but it's actually quite
easy to get a feel for it.
So let's plot it in two
dimensions for an electron.
Moving to the right,
the different colors here
represent the different phases,
and you can see how the phase
evolves over time and space.
Thank you to Richard Behiel
for inspiring this approach.
Now, if you look closely
at the original phase term,
you see A and phi, the magnetic
and electric potentials.
So watch what happens if we
add a magnetic vector potential
that points in the same direction
as the electron is traveling.
You can see that the wave stretches out.
So now the phase changes more slowly over
space than it did before.
And if the potential points the other way,
then now the wave gets more compressed
and its phase changes faster over space.
And a similar thing would
happen if you change the
electric potential phi.
Now, this by itself, I
think wasn't shocking
to most physicists, just
as you would always use the
potentials to make the math easier.
That's also why you use it
in the Schrodinger equation.
But really what's responsible
for these, you know,
even phase changes were still the fields.
But you spoke to Aharonov.
- Yeah
- And that wasn't his take.
- No. If you look at the
Schrodinger equation,
you can't just replace the potential phi
with the electric field E. 
- Why not?
Because you're losing information. 
- Okay?
Because remember, you can
define any number of potentials
for a specific electric field
because you can pick an arbitrary height,
but that information is lost when you go
and swap it out for the electric
field. There's another way to think about it.
- Okay, okay, it's getting real.
- So if you have an expression
like five x squared plus
five, you'd think you could
just write this as the integral
of 10 X, right?
Because the integral is
five x squared plus C.
- C, right? 
- C is a constant.
So it includes five, but it
also includes any other number.
But importantly, C is not five,
or at least not in every case.
So you lose this specificity
when you grow from a
potential to an electric field.
And Aharonov wasn't comfortable with that.
So he thought, what if every
quantum system was actually
influenced by the potential
and not by the field, right?
So it's the potential
that shows up in the Schrodinger equation.
So it is what influences wave functions.
He had to find a way to prove that
what we're observing is
always because of a potential
and not because of the field.
How do you do that complicated?
See, Aharonov had to design an experiment
that would send a
particle through a region
where there's no electric
or magnetic field,
but there is a potential in such a setup.
If the phase of the particles
wave function started changing
slower or faster, that had
to be the direct result
of the potential itself
because there are no fields,
- But that's where you run into a problem
because there's no way to
directly measure the phase
of a particle's wave function.
So how do you devise an experiment
that can yield a measurable result?
Well, Aharonov enlisted
the help of his mentor Bohm,
and together they came up
with the following theoretical experiment.
It starts with a beam of
electrons, which is split into two.
In the middle of these two
beams is a tightly coiled wire
known as a solenoid.
Now, solenoids have an
interesting property.
When you run a current through one,
it produces a strong magnetic
field inside the coil
and a very weak field outside the coil.
The longer the solenoid,
the weaker the field in
the surrounding space.
For simplicity, Aharonov and Bohm imagined a setup
with an ideal, infinitely long solenoid.
One where the magnetic field
outside the coil is exactly zero.
After traveling on opposite
sides of the solenoid,
the electron beams are redirected
back towards each other
by the researchers, and here
at this point, they intersect.
Now since electrons behave as waves,
though waves from the
intersecting beams overlap
and produce an interference
pattern, bright fringes
with gaps in between them.
The exact pattern depends on the phase
of each of these waves.
When the solenoid is off,
there is no magnetic field in the region,
the electrons are traveling through
and there is no magnetic potential.
The phase of the electrons
changes in the same way across
both beams, regardless of
whether they pass above
or below the solenoid.
And so you get an interference
pattern that looks like this,
but when the solenoid is turned on, well,
there is still no magnetic field
because it's confined
entirely within the coil,
but there is a magnetic potential.
That may sound strange,
but remember, the
magnetic field is the curl
of the magnetic potential.
The curl of the potential
can be zero in some region,
even when the potential itself is not.
And that's exactly what's happening here.
Now take a closer look at the
vector potential, in the space
the upper beam passes
through, the potential
points in the opposite
direction as the beam.
So here the phase changes faster,
but below the solenoid
it points in the same
direction as the beam.
So the phase changes slower.
If the phase truly depends
on the potential alone
and not the field, then the phases
of the two beams should
evolve differently.
So as a result, the interference
pattern should shift when
the solenoid is on versus
when it's off.
The magnetic field could be just zero,
and yet the presence,
some vector potential
could actually lead to observable effects
that wasn't supposed to happen, right?
- What I love about this
story is that it reminds me
that individual people can
challenge entire paradigms.
For nearly 200 years, many
of the smartest minds
in history all believed
that potentials were nothing
more than mathematical tools.
But then two outsider
physicists came along
and defied that interpretation,
confident in their approach
they took on the entire
scientific establishment.
That same belief in the
power of the individual is
what motivated me to
partner with planet wild.
Many of us can feel helpless
when we look at the huge
problems facing the earth
today, deforestation,
plastic pollution, and the
extinction of entire species.
The easy solution is just to wait around
and hope someone else will
do something about it.
Planet wild gets boots on the ground
to actually protect our planet,
and they make it easy for
anyone to join the cause,
which is one of the
reasons I became a member.
Another reason is that every month we
as a community fund new projects
to clean up oceans, rewild,
forests, protect endangered
species and raise awareness.
You can think of planet wild
as crowdfunding for nature.
My favorite part, I get to see the impact
of my contributions through
outstanding monthly videos,
which are published right here on YouTube.
Take this for instance.
This is a planet wild mission in Mumbai.
It's a scalable technology that
stops plastic at the source,
preventing 10 tons from
reaching the ocean every month.
Planet wild invested over a hundred thousand
dollars in this, and that money
didn't come from governments
or corporations,
it came from ordinary
people like you and me.
You can sign up for whatever
amount feels right for you
and cancel any time.
The first 150 people
to sign up using my code
Veritasium one will get their first
month paid for by me.
Just scan this QR code or click
the link in the description.
If you're interested in the
science behind their projects,
then go check out their YouTube channel.
I'm leaving the link
to the plastic cleanup
mission in the description
and now back to the mystery
of the potential.
Aharonov and Bohm published their findings in 1959,
and the reception was mixed.
- Even Niels Bohr, one
of the founding fathers
of quantum mechanics, found
it impossible to accept
that a particle could be influenced
by a potential in the
absence of any force.
But some physicists
supported Aharonov and Bohm
Richard Feynman wrote "the fact
that the vector potential
appears in the wave equation
of quantum mechanics was
obvious from the day it was written.
It seems strange in
retrospect that no one thought
of discussing this
experiment until 1959 when Bohm
and Aharonov first suggested it
and made the whole question crystal clear."
Feynman included himself that statement.
He later wondered why he had
never noticed the effect.
Physicist Victor Weisskopf
had a similar response.
"The first reaction to this
work is that it's wrong.
The second is that it's obvious."
Ultimately, there was only
one way to settle the debate.
Someone had to actually do the experiment.
The first to try was a colleague
of Aharonov and Bohms at the University of Bristol,
Robert Chambers.
Chambers' experiment
largely followed the setup.
Aharonov and Bohm proposed with
one notable exception,
an ideal solenoid would
have to be infinitely long,
which is physically impossible.
So instead, chambers used a
tiny needle-like piece of iron,
about a millionth of a meter
thick, and 500 times as long.
When this iron whisker was magnetized,
it produced a magnetic field
that was strong within the metal itself,
but negligible outside of it, as well
as a magnetic potential in the
surrounding region of space.
To get a baseline interference pattern,
Chambers fired two beams of electrons
around an empty region of space.
Then he added the magnetic whisker.
When he fired the beams, again,
the interference pattern shifted.
It seemed that Aharonov and Bohm were right,
but critics were unconvinced
- Maybe a stray field was
responsible for the effect,
not the potential,
- And that's showing throwing
no shade on their colleague
who did these cool experiments.
It's like it's hard,
right? It's really hard.
- And so it went for several decades,
experimentalists repeatedly
tested the Aharonov-Bohm effect,
but each trial had flaws
that left the result open to debate.
- Until in 1986, a team of
Japanese researchers led
by Akira Tonomura came up with a
new way to do the experiment.
See, they used a tiny donut shaped magnet
to make their magnetic
field with a perfect Taurus.
All the magnetic field is
contained within the loop.
Outside it, it's absolutely zero.
And as an added layer of protection,
the team also coded the
entire magnet in a layer
of superconducting niobium,
which would block out any leaking fields.
Now, previous experiments relied
on turning a magnetic field
on or off, but Tonomura's team
took on a different approach.
In their case, the
magnet is always on, but
because of its unique shape, the potential
outside the torus is different
from the one in the center.
It points towards us on the outside
and away from us on the inside.
And the team realized they
could take advantage of this.
They started by firing
off an electron beam,
which was actually wide
enough to be treated
as two separate beams.
Part of it traveled
along through empty space
and functioned as the control,
whereas the other part washed
over the entire torus.
And what's important here is
that the beam is wide enough so
that part of it passes around the torus
and part of it passes through.
Then at the end, a biprism deflects the electron
beams toward each other.
They intersect, and this is
where they create an interference pattern.
Now, think about
what this interference
pattern should look like.
Well, for starters, there should
be a shadow of the torus,
so we can fill that in.
But the rest, well, it
depends on whether the Aharonov-
Bohm effect is real or not.
If it's not real, we'd expect
to see an interference pattern
that looks something like
this, where the pattern
outside the torus and
in the center match up.
But if it is real, then
the electrons that traveled
through the center would've
experienced a different
potential, which would've
shifted their pattern
by half a phase.
So that should look something like this.
Now here are the results
from Tonomura's experiment.
You see these are the interference fringes
inside and outside the magnet.
And then if you follow what is a peak
outside the torus lines up with,
- Right?
- A trough inside the middle, and then
it's a peak outside again.
And that's exactly what they predicted.
This is exactly what they
predicted. - So it's real. - It's real
- And yet soon a new debate
emerged. The effect is real.
Sure, but how should we interpret it?
What is it really telling
us about the nature
of the universe? 
Today
Physicists largely fall
into one of two camps.
The first camp claims
that potentials aren't just
mathematical conveniences.
They can influence physical reality.
This is the perspective
initially favored by Aharonov
and Bohm, as they wrote in
the abstract of their paper.
Contrary to the conclusions
of classical mechanics,
there exist effects
of potentials on charged
particles even in the region
where all fields vanish.
Some take this position a step further,
since the potentials show up
in the Schrodinger equation
and the fields do not.
Well, they argue that the
potentials are more fundamental
to physics than fields are.
Richard Feynman supported this idea.
He wrote A is as real as B  - realer,
whatever that means.
- I mean, I kind of like
that interpretation,
but something about the
potential bothers me.
And that's the fact
that you can set the potential
at any arbitrary height.
It can be plus infinity.
It can be minus infinity,
anything in between.
So wouldn't that change?
You know how the potential actually
influences the way function?
- This bothered me too, so much so
that I actually ended up
asking a professor about this,
but it turns out it can't.
- It's not
just the potential that's
that's entering the observable,
it's the line integral.
So it's only A that enters.
It's not the magnetic field B vanishes.
It's only A, but it's not A alone.
- It gets a little technical here,
but you know, if I pull up, you know,
- As one does - As one does a flip chart,
now we can actually run this.
So if you look at how
the potential shows up,
then what's measurable is
not the phase directly,
but it's the phase shift.
Call it delta theta.
Then the phase shift is line
integral of A over the path
or dotted with the path.
So you get this.
Now you can imagine, okay,
let's add a constant to this.
And if our setup is roughly,
you know, we start here,
one electron beam goes like this,
and the other one goes like this,
and these are symmetric, then
the potential here will point,
let's say in this direction.
But here it will point in that direction.
Let's say instead of A, we
do A plus C, some constant.
Then when we're taking the
path this way, we'll be adding
that C and we'll be dotting it with dx.
But because that path is the
exact same when we go this
way, we just subtract it.
So it cancels out.
So the potential, yeah, it does show up,
but in such a way that
all the arbitrariness
of the potential, it
cancels out perfectly.
- Okay?
- It's a geometrical quantity solving a
that has taken care of for which all
that residual ambiguity has
has literally canceled out
- The potentials,
being physical might sound strange,
but the second interpretation
is even stranger
physicists in camp two maintain
that potentials really are
just mathematical objects
and the fields are
responsible for the effect.
But in Tonomura's experiment,
the magnetic field was
completely confined within the
solenoid, for this
interpretation to be true,
its supporters are forced to assert
that fields can act non-locally.
That is a field can influence
things outside the region
of space where the field itself exists.
Many physicists find this
idea difficult to swallow.
- I think the idea of
saying that these fields act
non-locally undoes the reason why we have
field theory, right?
The great try of a field theory,
which has served us so well
for more than 100 years, is
this notion, stubborn notion
that local causes yield
only local effects.
- And yet Aharonov's own
perspective has shifted from
camp one to camp two.
- While non-locality remains
a controversial idea,
a sizable portion of
physicists do side with Aharonov,
and the debate continues to this day,
- I maybe have a third interpretation.
- Good.
- And I would love to get your thoughts,
and if it's bad, please tell me honestly.
- Okay 
- So we did this other video about particles
essentially exploring all
possible paths all at once.
And so right now we're saying
either the potentials are real
or fields are acting non-locally.
But what if there's a third option
where the fields are still local
and it is the fields that
are affecting the change,
but rather it's the particles
that are exploring all
possible paths all at once.
You could potentially even
have some quantum tunneling
effects going inside an
area where there are fields,
you know, as the electron or
the wave function at least
explores all possible
paths, gets influenced
by those slight bits
where the wave function
is inside the field.
- I actually don't think
that's ridiculous, Casper.
That's how, that's for a
strong ringing endorsement.
I think there's a lot to that.
- Okay,
- If we could think about these things
as it is indeed the quantum
phase that's being affected,
- Yeah
- We can describe that phase in terms
of quantum mechanical path integrals.
I think that's a perfectly
reasonable way to to frame it.
So yeah, I'd buy that. - That's awesome.
- I'm pretty sure this
isn't the complete answer,
but one thing which would be
cool is if someone else takes
this idea, you know, or
maybe it gets inspired by it
and they're like, actually
that doesn't work,
but here is how it does
work and now we're closer.
- That's right. That would
be the best possible outcome.
Well, the best possible outcome
is, is you're just right.
But the second best possible
outcome is that, is that
that nudges the community
more broadly to ask those
to ask new questions of
familiar material. That's right.
- One new question the
community asked was,
is there also a gravitational version?
In 2022, researchers at
Stanford tested this.
A simplified version
of their experiment works
something like this.
They shut up ultra cold rubidium
atoms into a tube shaped
vacuum chamber at the top of
which was a tungsten mass.
Now, atoms like electrons are also
governed by a wave function.
So they split each rubidium
atoms wave function into two
distinct packets, and they launched them
to different heights.
One was sent really high
and got close to the mass
whereas the other didn't.
And then when the two
collided at the bottom,
this created an interference pattern.
And when they let this interfere
and accounted for all other effects,
they could clearly see the
phase shift as predicted
by Aharonov and Bohm
So it seems like the
gravitational Aharonov 
and Bohm effect is real. 
If the results hold up the scrutiny,
this is a huge finding
because it suggests
that the electromagnetic
and gravitational potentials
can influence reality at the
most fundamental scale,
even when all the fields are exactly zero.
So does that mean that most
physics textbooks are wrong
or need updating?
- Don't throw out all the
textbooks. They're beautiful.
We learn a lot, but that
doesn't mean we're done
and we should be open to surprise.
And just because things haven't
changed in let's say 200
years roughly between say Lagrange
and Aharonov-Bohm, they
still could change, right?
And they can sometimes change
in in beautiful and surprising
and very powerful ways.
- I read somewhere that
the reason you decided
to do the AB effect was
that you didn't really think
potentials were something
that was just a mathematical tool like
most scientists believe.
