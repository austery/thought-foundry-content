Brian
 Johnson
 wants
 to
 break
 the
 chains


of
 biology.
 I
 want
 to
 break
 the
 chains


of
 time.
 We
 can
 always
 raise
 another


round
 or
 do
 another
 trade,
 but
 you
 can't


raise
 another
 decade.


>> You're
 running
 a
 massive
 company.
 You


also
 do
 investing.
 You're
 also
 a
 happy


marriage
 with
 four
 kids.
 I
 know
 the
 way


that
 you
 do
 it
 all
 is
 delegation.
 What


is
 the
 secret
 that
 you've
 figured
 out?


>> Cardinal
 sin
 of
 delegation
 is
 that
 it


will
 be
 faster
 or
 better
 to
 do
 it


myself.
 And
 the
 reason
 it's
 a
 blocker
 is


cuz
 it's
 true.
 But
 the
 only
 way
 you
 get


leverage
 is
 by
 going
 through
 that
 work.


A
 couple
 decades
 ago,
 you
 had
 to
 be
 Mark


and
 Dreston
 urban
 Kosla
 to
 have
 a
 half


dozen
 assistants
 and
 that
 cost
 you
 half


a
 million
 dollars.
 Now
 with
 a
 company


like
 Athena
 for
 3,000
 bucks
 a
 month,
 you


can
 have
 your
 own
 assistant.


>> What
 have
 you
 learned
 in
 your
 extensive


founder
 career?


>> Jonathan,
 welcome
 to
 the
 podcast.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> So
 Jonathan,
 you're
 running
 a
 massive


company.
 What
 4,000
 employees?


>> 4,000


>> 4,000
 employees.
 You
 also
 do
 investing.


You're
 also
 in
 a,
 you
 know,
 happy


marriage
 with
 with
 four
 kids.
 How
 do
 you


do
 it
 all?
 I
 know
 the
 way
 that
 you
 do
 it


all
 is
 delegation.
 You
 have
 a
 chief
 of


staff,
 a
 bunch
 of
 EAs.
 Why
 don't
 you


talk
 about
 what
 is
 the
 secret
 that


you've
 figured
 out
 that
 other
 people
 can


learn
 from?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 my
 origin
 story
 here
 is
 out
 of


school,
 I
 worked
 at
 the
 White
 House
 and


uh
 I
 sat
 I
 sat
 in
 the
 West
 Wing
 next
 to


the
 president's
 executive
 assistants.


And
 as
 you
 might
 imagine,
 the
 EAs
 in
 the


West
 Wing
 were
 really
 freaking
 good.
 And


it
 set
 my
 bar
 super
 high
 for
 what
 this


EA
 client
 partnership
 could
 look
 like.


And
 when
 I
 moved
 to
 San
 Francisco
 to


start
 a
 Thumbtac,
 I
 said,
 "Okay,
 I'm
 not


president,
 but
 what
 if
 I
 had
 a
 EA
 and


support
 team
 that
 was
 as
 good
 as
 the


presence?
 Like,
 what
 could
 I


accomplish?"
 And
 so
 at
 Thumbtac,
 as
 we


were
 scaling
 the
 business,
 I
 hired
 my


first
 assistant
 in
 the
 Philippines


started
 helping
 me
 with
 basic
 stuff,


inbox,
 calendar,
 uh,
 and
 then
 we
 just


got
 creative
 and
 we
 did
 more
 and
 more


complex,
 interesting
 things,
 which
 we


can
 talk
 about.
 And
 what
 I
 found
 was
 the


more
 leverage
 I
 got,
 the
 more
 ambition
 I


got
 and
 it
 just
 compounded.
 And,
 you


know,
 you
 started
 with
 one
 assistant,


now
 I've
 got
 a
 half
 dozen
 and
 every


assistant
 gives
 me
 more
 leverage
 to
 take


on
 more
 things.
 It's
 fascinating
 because


I
 some
 people
 say,
 "Hey,
 you
 know,
 Bill


Gates
 is
 so
 much
 richer
 than
 me,
 but
 he


has
 the
 same
 phone
 that
 I
 have."
 Or
 I


remember
 um
 maybe
 it
 was
 you,
 maybe


someone
 else
 who
 was
 like,
 "Wait,
 Obama


should
 have,
 you
 know,
 or
 the
 president


should
 have
 way
 better
 information
 than


me,
 and
 yet
 they're
 like
 reading


political
 like
 they're
 reading
 the
 same


media."
 And
 this
 is
 like
 another
 example


of
 it,
 which
 is
 the
 democratization


where
 White
 House
 have
 amazing


assistance,
 but
 thanks
 to
 Athena,
 you


know,
 and
 and
 you
 know,
 technology,
 at


some
 point,
 everyone
 will
 have
 a
 certain


block.


>> Exactly.
 that
 you
 know
 a
 couple
 decades


ago
 you
 had
 to
 be
 Mark
 Andre
 and
 Urban


Kosva
 to
 have
 a
 half
 dozen
 assistants


and
 that
 cost
 you
 half
 a
 million


dollars.
 Now
 with
 a
 company
 like
 Athena


for
 3,000
 bucks
 a
 month
 you
 can
 have


your
 own
 assistant
 and
 then
 with
 AI
 yeah


it's
 going
 to
 become
 ubiquitous.
 People


are
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 billions
 of


people
 learning
 to
 delegate
 to
 a
 machine


assistant
 and
 as
 your
 budget
 increases


you
 might
 add
 a
 human
 or
 a
 chief
 of


staff
 on
 top
 but
 it's
 just
 kind
 of
 a


ladder
 of
 leverage.
 How
 should
 we
 think


about
 what
 are
 the
 things
 that
 humans


can
 do
 versus
 what
 are
 the
 things
 that


AI
 can
 do?
 You
 know,
 remember
 my
 friend


started
 CL
 um
 you
 know
 a
 decade
 ago


which
 is
 trying
 to
 be
 AI
 assistance


effectively.
 Obviously
 this
 is
 well


before
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 innovation
 but
 what


is
 the
 right
 way
 of
 thinking
 about
 sort


of
 the
 human
 AI
 you
 know
 relationship.


>> Yeah
 I
 mean
 it's
 a
 moving
 target


obviously
 is
 going to
 get
 increasingly


more
 capable
 and
 our
 view
 is
 it's
 like


self-driving
 cars
 where
 it's
 not


self-driving
 overnight.
 It's
 you
 drive


the
 Tesla
 at
 first
 and
 then
 there's


assisted
 steering
 and
 braking
 and
 then


over
 time
 it
 becomes
 more
 autonomous.


And
 the
 same
 thing
 is
 going
 to
 happen


with
 assistants.
 My
 my
 view
 here
 for


founders
 is
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 an


assistant,
 you
 are
 the
 assistant
 and
 you


don't
 want
 to
 be
 the
 assistant.
 And
 so


no matter
 your
 budget,
 you
 should
 first


start
 by
 learning
 to
 delegate.
 Uh
 and
 if


you
 only
 got
 20
 bucks
 a
 month,
 you
 start


by
 delegating
 to
 chat
 GPT.
 And
 prompt


engineering
 is
 really
 just
 delegating.


And
 if
 you
 become
 world
 class
 at


leveraging
 Chat
 GPT
 to
 brainstorm
 your


goals,
 figure
 out
 how
 uh
 you
 can
 take


the
 next
 step
 in
 the
 business,
 once
 you


have
 the
 budget
 for
 a
 human
 assistant
 or


chief
 of
 staff,
 then
 you're
 prepared
 to


go
 that
 next
 level.
 So
 you
 start
 20


bucks
 a
 month.
 Um
 if
 you
 have
 budget,


then
 you
 hire
 someone
 direct
 with
 a


service
 like
 Athena.
 If
 you
 have
 enough


money,
 you
 hire
 someone
 in
 person.


That's
 six
 figures,
 you
 know.
 And
 if


you're
 uh
 legendary
 budget,
 then
 you've


got
 a
 suite
 of
 assistants
 and
 chief
 of


staff
 following
 you
 around.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 I've
 had
 an
 for
 many
 years
 now
 and


and
 she's
 absolutely
 amazing
 and
 um
 you


know
 I
 use
 her
 for
 scheduling
 and
 u
 you


know
 typical
 assistant
 activities
 but


you
 have
 many
 assistants
 you
 know
 our


friend
 Sam
 Corkos
 has
 a
 bunch
 of


assistants
 as
 well


>> close
 the
 gap
 between
 what
 do
 the
 people


who
 do
 it
 well
 like
 you
 know
 what
 else


do
 people
 get
 leverage
 on
 or
 delegate


that
 maybe
 is
 not
 obvious.


>> So
 first
 you
 start
 by
 taking
 the
 pain


off
 of
 your
 life.
 So
 you
 I
 never
 wait
 on


hold.
 I
 never
 put
 my
 credit
 card
 in
 the


internet.
 I
 would
 never
 fill
 out
 DMV


forms,
 never
 do
 passport
 renewal.
 The


world
 is
 full
 of
 all
 these
 annoyances.


And
 so
 first
 you
 take
 off
 these
 things


that
 drain
 you
 that
 don't
 give
 you


leverage.
 Then
 once
 you've
 done
 that,


then
 the
 next
 thing
 is
 you
 raise
 your


sights
 and
 you're
 like,
 what's
 a
 new


business
 I
 could
 start?
 How
 can
 I
 scale


my
 business
 faster?
 Uh
 how
 can
 I
 spend


more
 time
 with
 my
 family?
 What
 are
 the


things
 uh
 I
 actually
 care
 to
 do
 a
 lot


more
 of?
 Yeah.
 Um,
 and
 so
 I
 start
 with


basic
 stuff,
 inbox,
 calendar,
 stuff
 that


everyone
 does,
 but
 then
 I
 just
 start


experimenting.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 during


the
 scaleup
 days
 of
 Thumbtac,
 when
 we're


in
 a
 house
 working
 all
 the
 time,
 I
 told


Marne,
 my
 assistant,
 I
 don't
 really
 have


any
 friends
 outside
 of
 work.
 I
 was
 like,


the
 only
 people
 I
 know
 are
 in
 this


building.
 I
 need
 to
 make
 some
 friends.


And
 so,
 I
 told
 her,
 let's
 plan
 a
 a


founder
 dinner
 at
 my
 house
 every
 other


week.
 And
 we
 did
 lots
 of
 this
 together


back
 in
 the
 day.
 And
 that's
 how
 I
 made


all
 my
 best
 friends.
 And
 I
 just
 walked


home
 from
 work
 and
 Marne
 had
 invited


people,
 set
 up
 the
 the
 chef
 and
 the


bartender
 and
 we
 walk
 in
 and
 we
 make
 new


friends
 and
 you
 know
 I
 met
 Catherine,
 my


wife
 through
 that
 and
 then
 Marty's


helping
 plan
 our
 wedding
 and
 now
 Mary


helps
 us
 with
 our
 kids
 and
 so
 you
 know


it
 starts
 small
 and
 then
 you
 just
 kind


of
 compound
 these
 things.


>> Yeah.
 But
 even
 in
 that
 example
 um
 like


say
 more
 about
 how
 did
 she
 know
 who
 to


reach
 out
 to
 or
 what
 kind
 of
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 So
 the
 kind
 of
 entrylevel


delegation
 is
 you
 delegate
 by
 task.
 you


say,
 "Help
 me
 plan
 this
 dinner
 party."


If
 you
 just
 say
 that,
 you're
 not
 going


to
 get
 what
 you
 want.
 Um,
 the
 more


advanced
 way
 to
 delegate
 is
 called


delegate
 by
 algorithm,
 where
 you


actually
 export
 your
 own
 internal


preferences
 as
 you
 delegate.
 So,
 I
 would


say,
 "Hey,
 when
 I
 plan
 dinner
 parties,
 I


like
 to
 have
 six
 to
 eight
 people.
 I
 like


people
 to
 have
 raised
 similar
 amounts
 of


capital
 or
 be
 at
 similar
 stages
 or


similar
 number
 of
 employees."
 And


literally
 write
 an
 algorithm
 for
 how
 you


find
 the
 right
 people.
 Um
 and
 then
 you


get
 feedback
 on
 whether
 it
 worked
 or


not.
 And
 once
 the
 algorithm
 is
 fully


exported
 from
 your
 head,
 then
 it's
 just


rinse
 and
 repeat.
 And
 so
 you
 know


engineers
 tend
 to
 be
 better
 at
 creating


these
 kind
 of
 like
 SOPs
 or
 standard


practices.
 But
 it's
 something
 yeah
 you


can
 learn
 to
 do.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 share
 more
 about
 what
 how


you
 for
 people
 have
 multiple
 systems
 or


how
 do
 you
 differentiate
 like
 how
 do
 you


you
 know
 sort
 of
 delegate
 across
 the


team?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 start
 with
 one
 uh
 and


then
 like
 any
 team
 you
 specialize
 and
 so


>> I
 just
 had
 one
 that
 did
 everything
 as
 a


generalist
 and
 now
 half
 dozen
 which
 I


know
 sounds
 crazy
 but
 each
 one


specialized
 in
 different
 things.
 One
 is


on
 work,
 one
 is
 on
 home,
 one
 is
 on
 kids,


family,
 travel,
 uh
 finances.


>> Um


>> and
 uh
 that
 specialization
 is
 helpful


because
 the
 finance
 person
 is
 just


thinking
 about
 balance
 sheet,
 uh
 you


know,
 sending
 wires,
 all
 of
 that
 sort
 of


stuff.
 And
 then
 I
 have
 a
 chief
 of
 staff


who
 sits
 on
 top
 who
 distributes
 work


>> across
 all
 of
 them.


>> What
 are
 other
 principles
 like,
 you


know,
 I
 love
 this
 delegate
 bio


algorithm,
 not
 not
 by
 task.
 What
 are


other
 principles
 or
 frameworks
 that
 are


really
 important
 or
 non-obvious
 to,
 you


know,
 get
 the
 most
 out
 of
 an
 assistant?


>> Yeah,
 the
 the
 cardinal
 sin
 of
 delegation


is
 that
 it
 will
 be
 faster
 or
 better
 to


do
 it
 myself.


>> That's
 the
 number
 one
 blocker
 for
 most


people.
 And
 the
 reason
 it's
 a
 blocker
 is


cuz
 it's
 true.


>> It
 will
 actually
 be
 faster
 or
 better
 if


you
 do
 it
 yourself
 that
 first
 time.
 And


it
 takes
 more
 effort
 to
 delegate
 to


teach
 someone
 how
 to
 do
 it.
 It
 might
 not


be
 as
 fast
 or
 as
 good
 as
 you'd
 like
 it,


but
 the
 only
 way
 you
 get
 leverage
 is
 by


going
 through
 that
 work.
 So,
 you
 have
 to


overcome
 that
 activation
 energy.
 The


second
 mistake
 people
 make
 is
 they
 don't


compound
 for
 the
 long
 term
 and
 they
 hire


someone
 and
 then
 switch
 an
 assistant


every
 6
 12
 months.
 But
 it's
 the


compounding
 that
 creates
 incredible


leverage.
 I've
 been
 working
 with
 Marne


for
 a
 decade,
 like
 a
 little
 sister
 now,


and
 she
 knows
 everything
 about
 me.
 Um,


so
 that's
 just
 kind
 of
 like
 common


principles.
 Um,
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 way
 to


delegate,
 I
 think
 the
 this
 is
 just


tactical
 the
 methods.
 You
 know,
 the
 most


common
 way
 people
 delegate
 is
 with
 your


thumbs
 on
 your
 phone.
 That's
 the
 worst


way.
 Very
 slow.
 Um,
 better
 to
 use
 all
 10


fingers
 at
 a
 computer,
 but
 that's


actually
 pretty
 slow
 as
 well.
 The
 best


way
 to
 really
 delegate
 is
 using
 your


voice.
 And
 so
 voice,
 you
 can
 talk
 two
 to


three
 times
 faster.
 You
 can
 do
 it
 on
 the


go.
 You
 can
 do
 it
 on
 a
 date
 between


lunch,
 you
 know,
 in
 the
 Uber.
 Um,
 you


know,
 at
 Thumbtac
 during
 hypers
 scale


times,
 I
 would
 walk
 between
 meetings
 and


between
 a
 meeting,
 I
 would
 be
 voice


noting
 to
 an
 assistant,
 here's
 the


takeaways,
 pre-draft
 these
 five
 emails,


uh,
 follow
 up
 with
 this
 person.
 And
 all


my
 work
 from
 that
 meeting
 was
 actually


delegated
 by
 the
 time
 I
 started
 the
 next


meeting
 versus
 everything
 kind
 of


accumulating
 and
 then
 you
 get
 to
 the
 end


of
 the
 day
 and
 you're
 like,


>> I
 have
 100
 things
 to
 do.
 And
 so
 learning


to
 delegate
 by
 voice,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 all


the
 super
 delegators
 at
 Athena,
 they
 are


all
 just
 delegating
 by
 voice
 all
 day


long,


>> right?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 fascinating.
 Well,
 at
 some


point
 it's
 going
 to
 be,
 you
 know,
 not
 I


don't
 even
 have
 to
 say
 it,
 I
 just
 think


it.


>> Yeah,


>> this
 is
 uh
 this
 is
 part
 of
 our
 vision
 uh


Athena
 longer
 term


>> is
 you
 shouldn't
 have
 to
 actually


vocalize
 it.


>> No.


>> And
 we've
 built
 an
 internal
 demo
 of


this.
 It's
 it
 uh
 it's
 not
 live.
 uh
 for


customers.
 But
 the
 way
 it
 works
 is
 we


build
 something
 that
 watches
 your
 screen


as
 you
 work
 and
 it
 screenshots
 the


screen
 and
 when
 it
 identifies
 things


that
 you
 should
 be
 delegating
 to
 your


assistant,
 it
 automatically
 adds
 it
 to


your
 assistant's
 task
 list.
 Your


assistant
 then
 says,
 "Oh,
 Eric
 would


want
 my
 help
 with
 this
 or
 maybe
 he'll
 do


this
 on
 his
 own."
 And
 that
 creates
 the


reinforcement
 learning
 effectively
 to


tune
 the
 model
 to
 pull
 things
 off
 of


your
 screen.
 You
 don't
 have
 to
 vocalize.


And
 so
 the
 person
 who
 built
 this


internally,
 he's
 been
 using
 it.
 The


majority
 of
 his
 delegations
 are
 now


machine
 generated.


>> Yeah,


>> he's
 not
 talking.
 He's
 just
 working
 and


the
 machine
 is
 magically
 pulling
 tasks


and
 putting
 on
 his
 assistance
 plate.
 Uh


it'll
 take
 a
 while
 to
 bring
 that
 to


market
 and
 fruition,
 but
 that's
 the


that's
 the
 future.
 There
 should
 also
 be


relatedly
 there
 should
 also
 be
 a
 version


where
 it's
 like
 you
 know
 you
 see
 in


Slack
 that's
 you
 know
 it's
 someone's


birthday
 or
 someone
 has
 a
 baby
 or


something
 and
 it
 suggests
 hey
 do
 you


want
 to
 yep
 you
 know
 get
 this
 person


this
 this
 specific
 gift
 or
 something.


Yeah,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 place
 where


we're
 thinking
 a
 lot
 about
 the
 human


machine
 merger
 and
 how
 we
 get
 the
 best


of
 both.
 And
 that's
 really
 the
 vision


Athena
 is
 like
 the
 best
 human
 assistant,


the
 best
 AI
 wrapped
 into
 one
 combined
 uh


product
 that's
 seamless.
 And
 humans
 off


obviously
 have
 human
 touch
 and
 good
 UX.


Uh
 but
 what
 machines
 can
 do
 is
 remember


everything
 and
 be
 super
 proactive.
 who


can
 look
 through
 every
 email,
 every


calendar
 and
 remind
 you
 to
 do
 things


that
 you
 would
 not
 have
 thought
 to
 do


otherwise.


>> One
 thing
 you've
 always
 been
 fascinated


about
 is
 sort
 of
 um
 international
 labor


some
 call,
 you
 know,
 labor
 arbitrage.


>> What
 is
 the
 right
 way
 of
 thinking
 about


what
 people
 in
 say
 the
 Philippines
 um


can
 do
 or
 can't
 do
 verse,
 you
 know,


assistance
 in
 the
 US?
 Like
 how
 do
 people


because
 obviously
 there's
 a
 huge
 cost


savings.
 Um
 what
 what
 are
 stuff
 that
 you


keep
 in
 that
 cost
 savings
 or
 stuff
 that


you
 don't
 keep
 or
 like
 what's
 the
 right


way
 of
 thinking?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 America's
 strength
 is


entrepreneurship,
 capital,
 innovation,


technology
 and
 um
 the
 more
 you
 can


leverage
 someone
 to
 do
 back
 office


tasks,
 the
 more
 you
 can
 spend
 on


technology,
 product,
 etc.
 So,
 you
 know,


I
 think
 the
 the
 thing
 Athena
 focuses
 on


is
 executive
 assistant,
 someone
 who
 can


do
 all
 of
 this
 admin.
 Um
 but
 people
 uh


are
 using
 global
 talent
 for
 all
 sorts
 of


things
 for
 legal,
 medical,
 um
 all
 the


above.


>> Yeah.
 So
 let's
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 on
 the


finance
 thing.
 I'm
 curious
 because
 I
 I


don't
 leverage
 mine
 there.
 What
 are
 the


ways
 that
 people
 could
 get
 leverage
 from


this
 because
 are
 you
 are
 you
 still


interfacing
 with
 with
 the
 accountants
 or


are
 they
 do
 Yeah.
 What
 is
 the
 right
 way


of
 thinking
 about?


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 the
 first
 thing
 I'd
 recommend


if
 uh
 you're
 getting
 an
 assistant
 uh
 is


to
 have
 them
 help
 you
 save
 money.
 Uh
 if


you
 have
 a
 big
 budget,
 not
 a
 big
 deal,


but
 the
 first
 project
 can
 be,
 hey,
 help


pay
 for
 your
 salary
 by
 looking
 through


all
 my
 subscriptions,
 finding
 things
 to


say,
 save
 me
 money,
 find
 me
 refunds.
 Um


so
 that's
 just
 kind
 of
 like
 a


cost-saving
 bucket.
 Um
 then
 there's


admin
 paying
 bills.
 Um
 and
 then
 there's


coordination,
 which
 is
 what
 you're


talking
 about,
 basically
 being
 a
 PM.
 So


coordinating,
 you
 know,
 the
 tax
 attorney


asks
 for
 something
 from
 the
 accountant,


and
 there's
 a
 bunch
 of
 docs,
 and
 it's


just
 moving
 paperwork
 between
 Yeah.
 uh


systems
 um
 at
 enough
 scale
 and


complexity
 that
 becomes
 effectively
 a


full-time
 job.
 And
 obviously
 you
 need


someone
 you
 truly
 trust
 uh
 to
 go
 deep


with
 and
 we
 kind
 of
 recommend
 that
 you


build
 this
 trust
 over
 time
 and
 you
 know


you
 give
 email
 and
 calendar
 access
 at


first
 and
 bank
 account
 later.
 Uh
 but
 as


you
 earn
 that
 trust
 then
 the
 more
 access


you
 give
 effectively
 the
 more
 leverage


you
 get.


>> Yeah.
 the
 um
 yes
 it's
 really
 interesting


and
 and
 in
 terms
 of
 um
 say
 more
 about


what
 it's
 been
 like
 to
 scale
 this


company
 where
 you
 have
 and
 you
 know
 you


dealt
 with
 this
 thumb
 thumb
 too
 a
 little


bit
 in
 terms
 of
 just
 work
 forces
 in


different
 areas
 and
 how
 you
 think
 about


culture
 between
 them
 and
 um
 yeah
 kind
 of


what
 are
 the
 the
 challenges
 or
 what's


really
 important
 to
 get
 right


>> yeah
 um
 yeah
 I
 mean
 we
 we
 look
 for


cultures
 that
 have
 a
 strong
 affinity
 uh


to
 American
 culture
 Uh,
 you
 know,


Philippines
 has
 a
 long
 history
 with


America.
 They
 like
 know
 American
 pop


culture
 and
 sports
 better
 than
 I
 do.


>> Um,
 and
 then
 they
 have
 a
 very
 strong


work
 ethic
 and
 u,
 it's
 a
 caretaking
 um,


culture.
 So,
 there's
 lots
 of
 nurses
 and


one
 of
 the
 reasons
 we
 picked
 it
 for


assistance
 is
 being
 an
 executive


assistant
 is
 really
 taking
 care
 of


someone.
 It's
 like
 their
 full-time
 job


is
 to
 make
 your
 life
 better,
 is
 to
 take


things
 off
 your
 plate,
 to
 help
 you
 be


successful.
 And
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 uh


barriers
 for
 some
 people
 to
 get
 an


assistant
 is
 it
 feels
 indulgent.
 It's


like,
 do
 I
 should
 I
 really
 have
 someone


who's
 just
 taking
 care
 of
 me?
 Um,
 but


the
 way
 I
 flip
 that
 around
 is
 you
 not


delegating
 and
 you
 not
 giving
 leverage


is
 holding
 you
 back,
 but
 it's
 actually


preventing
 you
 from
 creating
 a
 job
 for


someone
 who's
 excited
 to
 help
 you.
 Yeah.


>> And
 for
 the
 people
 on
 our
 team,
 like


they
 get
 to
 work
 with
 a
 CEO,
 they
 get
 to


see
 behind
 this
 exciting
 startup
 that
 um


is
 a
 totally
 different
 life
 than
 they


live.
 And
 for
 them,
 that
 is
 a
 cool,


exciting,
 life-changing
 thing.


>> Yeah.
 One
 thing
 that
 I
 think
 people


should
 be
 using
 assistance
 more
 for
 is


uh
 is
 not
 only
 delegation
 but
 also


accountability
 of
 like
 hey
 you
 want
 to


be
 you
 know
 exercising
 this
 amount
 or


you
 want
 to
 be
 spending
 your
 time
 doing


XYZ
 or
 you
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 you
 you


know
 you
 go
 to
 your
 appointments
 or
 or


something.
 Oh,
 do
 we
 have
 some
 uh


clients
 who
 actually
 exercise
 live
 with


their
 assistants
 for
 this
 reason?
 Like


they
 both
 have
 a
 fitness
 goal
 and
 so


they
 pull
 up
 videos
 at
 a
 set
 time
 and


they
 work
 out
 together
 and
 that's
 the


place
 where
 human
 accountability
 is
 a


little
 more
 powerful
 than
 machine


accountability.


>> Chatpt
 actually
 has
 a
 feature
 now
 where


it
 will
 automatically
 ping
 you
 on


things.
 So
 if
 you
 can't
 afford


assistant,
 you
 just
 tell
 CatchPT,
 here's


my
 top
 five
 goals,
 ask
 me
 how
 I'm
 doing


every
 day,
 log
 my
 results,
 and
 give
 me


feedback.
 You
 can
 get
 that
 for
 20
 bucks


uh
 a
 month.
 Um
 I've
 done
 similar


versions
 of
 this
 with
 Human
 Assistant.
 I


think
 we
 may
 have
 done
 this
 in
 the
 past


where
 I'm
 like,
 "Hey,
 I
 want
 to
 work


out,
 meditate,
 eat
 clean,


>> send
 me
 a
 a
 ping
 on
 WhatsApp
 every
 day,


and
 I'll
 just
 reply
 yes,
 no,
 yes,
 no


whether
 I
 did
 it."
 And
 then
 at
 the
 end


of
 each
 week,
 send
 me
 a
 scorecard
 and


compare
 me
 to
 Eric
 or
 Katherine
 and
 we


can
 have
 a
 little
 competition
 with
 it.


>> And
 yeah,
 helping
 you
 helping
 you
 hit


your
 goals
 is
 exactly
 what
 they
 should


be
 doing.
 Yeah.
 And
 then
 the
 other
 thing


I
 think
 is
 uh
 an
 interesting
 opportunity


to
 get
 more
 leverage
 because
 these


people
 are
 also
 you
 know
 um
 not
 just


operation
 savvy
 but
 also
 you
 know
 pretty


you
 know
 uh
 intuitive
 you
 know
 they
 go


into
 caring
 fields
 and
 so
 there's
 also


like
 opportunities
 for
 coaching
 too
 or


like
 there
 you
 know
 they're
 the
 people


that
 have
 most
 context
 on
 you
 and
 they


can
 give
 feedback
 on
 how
 you're
 engaging


or
 like
 you
 know
 they
 can
 tell
 you
 hey


you're
 tired
 today
 you
 know.
 Yeah,
 the


>> that
 was
 my
 first
 observation
 uh
 when
 I


was
 in
 the
 West
 Wing.
 The
 assistants
 who


sat
 next
 to
 the
 president
 were
 insane.


They
 were
 so
 good.
 They
 went
 on
 to


become
 like
 elected
 to
 Congress
 and


amazing
 people.


>> Um
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 the


president,
 his
 adviserss
 would
 have
 been


meeting
 with
 senators
 and
 all
 these


people
 and
 they
 would
 finish
 the


meeting,
 they
 would
 lean
 back
 and
 they


would
 have
 the
 assistant
 come
 over
 and


they'
 just
 be
 like,
 "What's
 going
 on?"


And
 it
 was
 it
 was
 more
 than
 just


accomplishing
 things.
 This
 was
 their


closest
 confidant
 who
 saw
 behind
 the


scenes
 on
 everything.
 They
 knew
 the
 good


and
 the
 bad.
 They
 know
 they'd
 gotten


kicked
 in
 the
 nuts
 a
 couple
 times
 that


day
 from
 different
 things.


>> And
 they're
 there
 for
 them.
 And
 I
 think


that
 human
 element
 is
 going
 to
 remain


important
 for
 a
 long
 time,
 no matter
 how


uh
 good
 AI
 gets.
 And
 it's
 something
 you


should
 lean
 into.
 We
 have
 uh
 clients
 who


tell
 us
 that
 yeah
 like
 going
 through
 a


divorce
 or
 a
 depression
 and
 like
 my


assistant's
 like
 there
 for
 me
 in
 a
 way


that
 others
 aren't
 and
 like
 I
 can't
 tell


my
 company
 or
 my
 team
 about
 some
 of


these
 things
 but
 it's
 this
 is
 the
 person


that's
 like
 on
 the
 inside
 with
 you.


>> Yeah,
 totally.
 Relatedly,
 one
 of
 the


things
 you've
 had
 really
 interesting


insights
 on
 over
 the
 years
 is
 um
 is
 how


to
 spend
 time.
 think
 about
 time


management
 not
 not
 only
 in
 terms
 of
 ways


to
 get
 more
 of
 it
 v via
 delegating
 but


also
 you
 know
 h
 how
 to
 prioritize
 and


you
 know
 I've
 I've
 learned
 this
 from


from
 you
 but
 you
 think
 about
 goals
 on
 a


sort
 of
 you
 know
 annual
 quarterly
 you


know
 like
 on
 different
 increments
 why


don't
 you
 maybe
 we
 could
 start
 with
 LBD


and
 how
 you
 think
 about
 goal
 setting
 in


general
 and
 then
 we
 can
 you
 know
 bit


deeper


>> yeah
 I
 mean
 my
 wife
 Katherine
 and
 I
 who


uh
 we
 met
 as
 friends
 one
 of
 you
 know


developed
 this
 friendship
 over
 one
 of


these
 entrepreneurship
 dinners.
 We
 read


this
 book
 um
 called
 How
 You
 Measure
 Your


Life
 by
 Clayton
 Christensen
 and
 he


basically
 told
 the
 story
 of
 how
 Harvard


Business
 School
 professor
 kids
 come
 back


at
 reunions
 and
 they're
 Fortune
 500


CEOs,
 super
 rich
 and
 their
 lives
 are
 in


shambles.
 They're
 divorced,
 have
 all


these
 problems,
 the
 kids
 don't
 talk
 to


them
 and
 going
 to
 jail.
 And
 he's
 like


the
 rigor
 they
 apply
 to
 their


businesses,
 the
 quarterly
 reviews,
 the


metrics
 were
 completely
 absent
 from


their
 life.
 And
 his
 point
 was,
 how
 do


you
 want
 to
 measure
 your
 life?
 And


Katherine
 and
 I
 read
 this
 book
 and
 we


were
 just
 friends
 at
 the
 time,
 but
 we're


both
 like,
 I
 want
 to
 be
 on
 your
 life


board
 directors.
 Let's
 freaking
 do
 that.


And
 so
 we
 just
 started
 tradition
 a


decade
 ago.
 Every
 quarter
 we
 get


together,
 we
 fill
 out
 a
 survey
 on
 our


relationship,
 uh
 strengths
 and


weaknesses,
 kind
 of
 squat
 analysis,


geeky
 stuff,
 and
 then
 we
 talk
 about
 like


what
 can
 we
 improve,
 uh
 what
 could
 we
 do


better,
 and
 like
 anything
 if
 you
 the


more
 you
 invest,
 the
 better
 it
 gets.


>> Totally.
 And
 yeah,
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 key


point
 because
 some
 people
 are
 turned
 off


by
 sort
 of
 like
 uh
 quantification
 like


they
 want
 their
 relationship
 placed
 like


you
 know,
 relax
 or
 turn
 off
 or


something.
 I
 think
 it's
 less
 that
 you


have
 to
 like,
 you
 know,
 quantify
 every


element
 of
 it
 and
 more
 just
 that
 you


want
 to
 prior
 you
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 let


the
 lack
 of
 quantification
 mean
 that


you're
 not
 prioritizing
 it.
 Um,
 and
 so


this
 is
 just
 an
 exercise
 to
 make
 sure


that
 you're
 actually
 just
 like
 keeping


accountable
 to
 how
 you
 want
 to
 be.


>> Exactly.
 It's
 uh
 be
 purposeful,
 get
 the


thing
 you
 want.
 If
 you're
 a
 geek
 like


us,
 then
 you
 measure
 it
 and
 you
 track


everything.
 Uh,
 and
 if
 you
 just
 want
 to


go
 have
 like
 a
 date
 and
 drink
 wine
 and


talk
 about
 your
 relationship,
 that
 works


too.
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 the
 people


prioritize
 fitness
 or
 their
 work,
 but


they
 never
 think
 about
 how
 do
 I


prioritize
 my
 relationship?
 Like
 what's


the
 what's
 the
 fitness
 or
 the
 workout
 or


the
 yoga
 equivalent
 for
 my
 relationship?


Having
 been
 in
 many
 goal
 setting


sessions
 with
 you,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I


think
 that
 you
 intuitively
 understand
 or


have
 learned
 um
 and
 are
 often
 instilling


in
 others
 is
 this
 idea
 of
 um


prioritization.
 Like
 when
 people
 set


goals,
 they
 set
 a
 lot
 of
 goals
 and
 they


don't
 sort
 of
 think
 about,
 hey,
 what
 is


the
 one
 that
 makes
 everything
 else
 much


easier?
 Um
 and
 uh
 you
 know,
 what
 is
 the


one
 the
 one
 thing
 that
 if
 we
 did
 would


be
 a
 great
 year,
 a
 great
 quarter,


whatever
 it
 is.


>> Who
 sets
 too
 many
 goals?


>> You
 know,
 me
 a
 little
 bit.
 Uh
 but
 uh
 but


yeah.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 my
 view
 is
 there's
 a
 power


law
 in
 everything
 and
 power
 law
 in


business,
 power
 law
 in
 venture,
 power


law
 in
 your
 life.
 And
 there's
 typically


one
 thing
 every
 month
 or
 quarter
 that
 if


you
 accomplish
 is
 worth
 more
 than


everything
 else
 combined.
 And
 figuring


out
 what
 that
 one
 thing
 is
 uh
 is
 what


you
 should
 do.
 Figure
 that
 thing
 out
 and


then
 go
 all
 in
 on
 that.
 And
 not
 to
 say


that
 having
 other
 goals
 isn't


worthwhile,
 but
 if
 you
 haven't


identified
 the
 one
 thing
 and
 gone
 allin


to
 make
 that
 happen,
 then
 I
 think
 it's


not
 optimized.
 I
 think
 it's
 also
 easier


to
 kind
 of
 procrastinate
 on
 the
 most


important
 thing
 in
 your
 life
 by
 having
 a


a
 long
 list.
 Yeah.


>> And
 you
 do
 a
 bunch
 of
 different
 things,


but
 there's
 that
 one
 thing.
 It's
 find


your
 partner,
 it's
 start
 the
 business,


it's
 fix
 my
 health.
 That
 really
 is
 more


foundational
 than
 everything
 else.


>> So
 to
 that
 end,
 um
 I'm
 curious
 if
 you


could
 share
 more,
 you
 know,
 frameworks


or
 principles
 you
 live
 by
 in
 terms
 of


time.
 Like
 for
 example,
 I
 I
 believe
 you


put
 you
 try
 to
 stack
 meetings
 in,
 you


know,
 in
 a
 day
 or
 in
 as
 few
 days
 as


possible
 or
 something.
 What
 are
 what
 are


certain
 sort
 of
 frameworks
 that
 are


important
 for
 you
 in
 terms
 of
 time,


energy,
 you
 know,


>> I
 mean
 high
 level
 is
 Brian
 Johnson
 wants


to
 break
 the
 chains
 of
 biology
 or


longevity.
 I
 want
 to
 break
 the
 chains
 of


time
 and
 you
 know
 the
 question
 I
 asked


myself
 is
 like


>> what's
 the
 most
 valuable
 asset
 in
 the


world?
 It's
 not
 gold
 or
 bitcoin
 or


nvidia
 clusters.
 It's
 time.
 Uh
 we
 can


always
 raise
 another
 round
 or
 do
 another


trade
 but
 you
 can't
 raise
 another


decade.
 And
 so
 if
 time
 is
 the
 primary


asset
 uh
 and
 it's
 more
 foundational
 than


everything
 else,
 we
 should
 focus
 on


owning
 that
 and
 controlling
 it.
 And
 so


for
 different
 this
 means
 different


things
 for
 different
 people.
 If
 you
 are


in
 hardcore


scale
 mode,
 that
 may
 mean
 halfhour


meetings
 for
 14
 hours
 a
 day
 where
 you


are
 just
 grinding
 out
 interviews
 and


doing
 things
 that
 only
 you
 can
 do
 as
 a


founder.
 uh
 or
 it
 may
 mean
 clearing
 your


schedule
 and
 having
 time
 to
 dream
 about


the
 future
 of
 the
 product
 or
 big
 deals.


And
 I
 think
 you
 just
 have
 to
 know
 what


stage
 of
 the
 business
 you're
 in


>> and
 then
 design
 your
 calendar


purposefully
 around
 that.
 And
 if
 you


look
 back
 on
 the
 last
 month
 and
 the


calendar
 does
 not
 reflect
 your
 highest


goals,
 then
 uh
 you're
 not
 doing
 it


right.


>> Yeah.
 I
 remember
 uh
 Keith
 Boy
 shared


with
 me
 this
 idea
 of
 like
 at
 the
 end
 of


every
 week
 do
 a
 calendar
 audit
 of
 the


past
 week
 like
 what
 are
 the
 meetings
 you


had
 that
 you
 wish
 you
 wouldn't
 have
 and


then
 just
 look
 at
 the
 next
 week.


>> I
 mean
 there's
 a
 place
 uh
 you
 know


Athena
 assistants
 can
 do
 this


proactively
 for
 you
 but
 there's
 a
 place


that
 AI
 is
 obviously
 going
 to
 automate


and
 it
 will
 be
 very
 powerful
 or
 it's
 at


the
 end
 of
 it
 each
 week
 it
 just
 tells


you
 here's
 what
 you
 prioritized
 those


actually
 your
 goals.


>> Yeah.


>> If
 not
 then
 next
 week
 we
 should
 adjust


those
 things.


>> Yeah.
 I'm
 curious
 for
 your


interpretation
 of
 meetings.
 Some
 people


are
 like
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 I
 want
 to
 have
 as


few
 meetings
 as
 possible.
 Me
 is
 not
 the


most
 efficient.
 I'd
 rather
 do
 everything


async.
 What
 what
 is
 your
 kind
 of


>> sort
 of
 thinking
 between
 async
 and


synchronous?


>> I
 mean
 Naval
 has
 a
 good
 line
 that's
 like


uh
 a
 phone
 call
 is
 better
 than
 a


meeting.
 A
 voice
 notes
 is
 better
 than
 a


call.
 A
 text
 is
 better
 than


>> a
 voice
 note.
 Uh
 I
 think
 in
 general


that's
 true.
 And
 uh
 there's
 this
 it's


almost
 like
 a
 generational
 thing
 where
 I


feel
 like
 you're
 in
 this
 a
 little
 bit
 of


like
 there's
 a
 reluctance
 to
 call
 people


on
 the
 phone
 and
 it's
 just
 we
 do


everything
 text
 and
 email
 but
 calling


people
 is
 super
 effective.
 It's
 really


high
 bandwidth.
 You
 can
 figure
 out


in
 5
 minutes.
 And
 so
 uh
 I
 personally
 try


to
 minimize
 meetings
 and
 then
 do
 more


picking
 up
 the
 phone
 and
 talking
 to


someone
 for
 five
 minutes.
 Um,
 when
 I'm


in
 more
 chairman
 mode,
 then
 I
 prioritize


as
 few
 meetings
 as
 possible
 and
 voice


notes
 and
 um
 I
 uh
 I
 what
 I
 request
 is


voice
 notes
 out
 and
 text
 message
 back


because
 read
 listening
 to
 voice
 notes
 is


slow.


>> It's
 assault
 as
 marketing.


Yeah.
 Um
 yeah
 it
 is
 interest
 you
 u
 one


of
 my
 favorite
 self-help
 books
 is
 the


seven
 effective
 habits
 of
 how
 effective


people
 and
 one
 of
 their
 you
 know


principles
 maxims
 is
 this
 idea
 of
 like


efficiency
 with
 when
 it
 comes
 to


achieving
 uh
 you
 know
 tasks
 or


accomplishing
 tasks
 but
 effectiveness


when
 it
 comes
 to
 people
 and
 and
 so
 um


you
 know
 the
 efficient
 path
 might
 not
 be


the
 effective
 path
 because
 you
 might


>> you
 sort
 of
 save
 some
 time
 on
 the
 front


end
 but
 you
 might
 you
 know
 acrew
 sort
 of


a
 debt
 on
 the
 on
 the
 back
 end.
 Yeah.
 And


um
 yeah,
 it
 might
 be
 efficient
 to
 just


send
 a
 text
 or
 something,
 but
 you
 know,


keeping
 the
 dynamic.
 Yeah,
 phone
 calls


are
 obviously
 under
 underrated.
 And


>> yeah,
 that's
 true.
 Remote
 cultures,
 too.


Like
 remote
 cultures
 build
 up
 debt
 of


just
 the
 lack
 of
 bandwidth.
 And
 so
 if


you
 are
 in
 a
 remote
 culture,
 you
 should


get
 together
 every
 couple
 months
 for
 a


few
 days
 in
 person.


>> H
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 how
 when


founders
 are
 asking
 for
 advice
 like
 how


how
 should
 I
 spend
 time?
 Like
 what


what's
 most
 important?
 like
 what


frameworks
 are
 helpful
 for
 founders


about
 thinking
 about
 obviously
 there's
 a


million
 things
 they
 could
 be
 doing


there's
 not
 enough
 time
 in
 the
 day
 for


you
 know
 even
 a
 fraction
 of
 them
 what


are
 the
 most
 important
 ways
 to
 to
 get


right
 whether
 it's
 your
 time
 at


>> thumbtack
 look
 is
 build
 your
 product


customers
 raise
 capital
 build
 your
 team


and
 when
 founders
 ask
 me
 like
 how
 to


leverage
 an
 assistant
 what
 should
 I
 be


doing
 my
 the
 way
 I
 turn
 around
 is
 like


what's
 your
 top
 two
 goals
 for
 the
 month


if
 it's
 recruiting
 uh
 you
 have
 to
 be


closing
 candidates
 But
 you
 don't
 need
 to


be
 sourcing
 all
 of
 the
 emails.
 You
 could


pull
 up
 a
 voice
 note
 and
 say,
 "Here's
 a


template
 I
 want
 you
 to
 reach
 out
 to.


Here's
 let
 me
 go
 through
 my
 contacts.


Here's
 20
 people."
 Send
 an
 outreach


email
 asking
 them
 for
 suggestions
 for


this
 role.
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 if
 your
 goal
 is


to
 raise
 capital,
 your
 assistant
 could


help
 project
 manage
 the
 the
 process
 of


all
 of
 that.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 step
 one


is
 you
 set
 your
 goals
 and
 then
 you
 break


them
 down
 into
 subtasks.
 and
 your


assistant
 won't
 be
 able
 to
 run
 the
 fund


raise
 but
 can
 run
 components
 of
 it
 and


your
 job
 is
 just
 to
 decompose
 things


into
 the
 smallest
 part
 that
 you
 can
 hand


off.


>> Maybe
 you
 should
 have
 some
 sort
 of
 like


forward
 deployed
 uh
 you
 know
 sort
 of


thing
 of
 what's
 it's
 not
 just
 the


assistant
 but
 it's
 also
 someone
 that


helps
 you
 like
 really
 get
 the
 most


leverage
 out
 of
 it
 and
 watches
 you
 know


your
 your
 activity.
 One
 of
 our
 learnings


from
 this
 business
 when
 we
 first
 started


it,
 we
 were
 like,
 we're
 just
 going
 to


hire
 the
 best
 assistants,
 match
 them


with
 clients,
 and
 boom,
 amazing.
 But
 we


matched
 the
 first
 five
 assistants,
 and


every
 single
 client
 said
 the
 same
 thing.


How
 do
 I
 delegate
 calendar?
 How
 do
 I


delegate
 inbox?
 And
 so
 it
 became
 clear


we
 need
 to
 invest
 more
 in
 actually


teaching
 the
 clients
 how
 to
 delegate
 uh


because
 that
 is
 as
 much
 of
 a
 constraint


as
 the
 assistants.
 And
 we've
 got
 a
 few


thousand
 assistants
 and
 clients.
 And
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 best
 performing


assistants
 at
 Athena,
 they
 work
 for
 the


best
 delegators.
 It's
 not
 a
 coincidence.


The
 reason
 they're
 the
 best
 is
 because


someone
 has
 figured
 out
 how
 to
 export


their
 ideas,
 decompose
 projects,
 create


SOPs
 in
 a
 way
 that
 helps
 the
 assistant


fly
 and
 the
 more
 mediocre
 delegators
 uh


struggle
 with
 that
 and
 need
 more


training.


>> Yeah.
 One
 one
 thing
 that
 you've
 been


phenomenal
 at
 is
 whether
 it's
 Stump
 Tech


or
 is
 is
 hiring
 executives.
 What
 do
 you


think
 that
 you
 do
 differently
 or
 what


what
 are
 the
 principles
 or
 frameworks


that
 really
 guide
 your
 sort
 of
 exec


hiring
 process?
 I
 mean
 one
 thing
 that
 is


obvious
 as
 you
 hire
 execs
 is
 the
 more


senior
 they
 go
 the
 better
 they
 are
 at


interviewing
 almost
 by
 definition
 and
 so


when
 you
 get
 to
 seuite
 they
 all
 are


really
 good
 at
 interviewing
 and
 so
 you


actually
 have
 to
 discard
 the
 interview


more
 the
 more
 senior
 they
 go
 and
 so
 I
 re


uh
 uh
 I
 I
 use
 references
 much
 more
 the


higher
 you
 go
 and
 then
 the
 other
 thing


that
 I
 think
 is
 interesting
 that
 people


should
 do
 more
 of
 is
 I
 just
 ask
 people


for
 their
 360
 reviews


like
 at
 their
 last
 company,
 10
 people


wrote
 reviews
 of
 them
 that
 are
 honest


about
 their
 strengths
 and
 weaknesses.


And
 I
 just
 asked
 to
 see
 it
 and
 I
 say,


"Hey,
 I'll
 share
 you
 share
 mine.
 You


show
 me
 yours.
 I
 actually
 think
 this


would
 be
 a
 cool
 kind
 of
 reference
 pro


startup
 um
 where
 you
 could
 like
 ping
 the


LM
 about
 someone
 versus
 pinging
 their


references."
 So,
 I
 try
 to
 get
 to
 more


ground
 truth
 on
 the
 person
 versus


>> the
 UX
 of
 an
 interview
 is
 just
 gonna
 be


pretty
 good
 when
 you
 get
 to
 the
 senior


level.
 What's
 most
 important
 in
 when
 you


when
 you're
 doing
 reference
 checks?
 What


do
 you
 really
 What's
 the
 way
 to
 get
 the


most
 signal
 out
 of
 them?


>> I
 mean,
 what
 I
 often
 tell
 people
 is,


hey,
 I'm
 probably
 going
 to
 hire
 this


person.
 Uh,
 and
 now
 tell
 me
 all
 the


things
 you
 don't
 like
 about
 them
 or


things
 that
 they
 could
 be
 better
 at.
 Cuz


if
 you
 know,
 people
 are
 so
 biased
 to


just
 tell
 you
 all
 the
 good
 things.
 You


have
 to
 get
 them
 to
 uh
 to
 see
 it
 as
 a


safe
 place
 to
 share
 strengths
 and


weaknesses.
 And
 yeah,
 just
 do
 enough


references
 until
 they
 start
 to
 sound
 the


same.
 And
 once
 they
 start
 to
 sound
 the


same,
 then
 you've
 got
 a
 signal.


>> Yeah.
 One
 question
 I
 like
 to
 ask
 is
 um


what
 skill
 sets
 would
 be
 really


important
 to
 complement
 this
 person


with?
 Um
 which
 is
 another
 way
 of
 just


saying
 what
 are
 they
 bad?
 Like
 you
 know


what's
 really
 important?
 Or
 one
 of
 my


favorite
 questions
 is
 if
 this
 didn't


work
 out
 in
 6
 months
 or
 a
 year,


>> you
 know,
 why
 would
 that
 be?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 I
 mean
 the
 best
 way
 to


source
 talent
 um
 I
 just
 hired
 an


executive
 recently
 is
 just
 ask
 the


people
 that
 you
 respect
 the
 most
 that


have
 the
 highest
 standards.
 Who's
 the


best
 person?
 So
 like
 here's
 the
 three


people
 who
 have
 the
 highest
 standards
 in


this
 role.
 I
 ask
 them
 for
 the
 two
 or


three
 best
 people
 and
 I
 go
 try
 to
 hire


one
 of
 them.


>> And
 that
 is
 the
 like
 speed
 rapid
 way
 to


hire
 an
 exec.
 Um
 you
 know
 using
 an
 exec


recruiter
 you
 spend
 three
 months
 you
 get


all
 this
 cold
 leads
 but
 going
 through
 a


network
 of


>> high
 bar
 people
 is
 super
 efficient.


>> There's
 some
 maxim
 that
 almost
 like
 half


of
 executives
 you
 know
 don't
 work
 out


within
 like
 a
 you
 know
 12
 to
 24
 month


period
 checks
 out.


>> Yeah.
 Why
 is
 that?
 I
 think
 it's
 this


it's
 difficult
 to
 uh
 judge
 uh
 the


interview
 process
 is
 not
 representative


of
 the
 work
 they're
 doing.
 And
 that's


ultimately
 what's
 broken
 about


interviewing
 is
 interviewing
 should
 be


someone
 doing
 the
 work
 they're
 going
 to


do.
 Um
 I
 think
 it
 was
 like
 Weebly
 back


in
 the
 day
 would
 actually
 have
 execs


come
 work
 for
 two
 weeks
 to
 trial
 before


they
 ever
 hired.
 That's
 difficult
 to


pull
 off
 because
 people
 have
 other
 jobs.


But
 I
 do
 think
 something
 like
 that
 makes


a
 lot
 of
 sense.
 your
 interview
 process


is
 just
 kind
 of
 irrelevant
 compared
 to


what
 the
 work
 they're
 doing
 in
 lots
 of


cases.


>> Yeah.
 And
 Keith
 has
 this
 maxim
 that


that's
 like
 um
 you
 you're
 not
 going to


get
 100%
 hiring
 in
 the
 same
 way
 you're


not
 going to
 get
 100%
 investing.
 And
 if


you
 know
 like
 you
 also
 want
 to
 avoid
 the


you
 know
 of
 not
 the
 uh
 trap
 of
 not


taking
 enough
 risk
 or
 moving
 too
 slow.


>> Yeah.
 And
 as
 long
 as
 you
 cut
 your
 losses


quickly
 it's
 okay.
 It's
 if
 you
 like


don't
 cut
 losses
 then
 you
 compound
 a


hole
 and
 that's
 where
 it's
 painful.
 The


the
 other
 thing
 I'd
 say
 is
 more
 useful


for
 basically
 all
 interview
 process
 is


project
 based
 work.
 Yeah.


>> So
 just
 like


>> you
 know
 hiring
 uh
 seuite
 for
 one
 pro
 uh


one
 part
 of
 the
 team
 I
 just
 tell
 them


what
 the
 pain
 points
 in
 the
 org
 are
 and


what
 I
 want
 to
 fix
 and
 I'm
 like
 come
 up


with
 a
 plan
 like
 how
 would
 you
 fix
 this


like
 if
 you
 we
 hire
 you
 you're
 then


going
 to
 do
 it
 and
 that
 sort
 of


practical
 work
 is
 more
 useful.


>> Yeah
 that's
 really
 interesting.
 What
 um


going
 back
 to
 other
 sort
 of
 founder


principles
 what
 is
 your
 stance
 on
 um


transparency
 with
 the
 company
 like


what's
 information
 that's
 helpful
 maybe


going
 back
 to
 thumbtack
 days
 what's


helpful
 for
 the
 the
 company
 to
 employees


to
 know
 like
 what
 what
 are
 principles


that
 that
 guide
 you
 know
 how
 much
 you


share


>> yeah
 I
 mean
 default
 transparency
 is


obviously
 the
 best
 but
 there's
 obviously


some
 lines
 like
 there's
 uh
 you
 know
 at


thumbtac
 there
 was
 a
 moment
 you
 may


remember
 this
 decade
 ago
 where
 I
 woke
 up


and
 I
 had
 a
 message
 from
 someone
 on
 our


team
 in
 the
 Philippines
 and
 it
 said


Thumbtac
 does
 not
 exist
 on
 the
 internet.


I
 was
 like
 what?
 And
 I
 went
 to
 Google.


You
 type
 in
 Thumbtac
 and
 nothing
 shows


up.
 And
 we
 basically
 received
 the
 death


penalty
 from
 Google.
 Uh
 there
 was
 a


>> misunderstanding.
 They
 thought
 we
 had


done
 something
 wrong,
 but
 they
 like


eliminated
 us
 from
 the
 internet.
 And
 so


our
 traffic
 went
 to
 zero
 and
 our
 revenue


went
 to
 zero.
 And
 I
 remember
 waking
 up


and
 like
 I
 go
 to
 the
 office
 and
 there's


a
 class
 of
 25
 new
 thumbtackers
 who
 it's


their
 first
 day.
 I'm
 supposed
 to
 do
 the


onboarding
 with
 them.
 There's
 a


journalist
 like
 walking
 around
 outside


trying
 to
 get
 a
 quote.
 And
 you
 know


that's
 one
 of
 those
 times
 where
 you


can't
 share
 everything.
 And
 so
 uh
 you


want
 to
 ultimately
 be
 transparent
 but
 if


I
 just
 walked
 into
 a
 new
 class
 and
 say


hey
 the
 business
 might
 be
 dead
 uh
 that's


not
 going
 to
 work.
 And
 so
 you
 have
 to


kind
 of
 get
 a
 handle
 of
 the
 situation.


uh
 you
 know
 the
 people
 who
 need
 to
 know


it
 know
 it
 and
 then
 once
 there's
 a
 plan


and
 a
 solution
 in
 place
 then
 the
 whole


company
 uh
 is
 told


>> yeah
 that
 that
 makes
 sense.
 Um
 at


Thumbtac
 you
 were
 a
 nonCEO
 co-founder


and
 you
 lasted
 you
 know
 a
 decade
 or


almost
 decade
 and
 you're
 still
 on
 the


board
 of
 course.
 Um
 I
 feel
 like
 it's


pretty
 rare
 when
 I
 think
 about


co-founding
 teams
 that
 it
 feels
 like
 the


nonCEO
 especially
 if
 not
 a
 CTO
 usually


doesn't
 last
 you
 know
 over
 5
 years
 or


something.
 Um
 I'm
 curious
 what's
 really


important
 to
 get
 right
 in
 in
 co-founder


relationships
 or
 how
 you
 think
 about


advising
 you
 know
 companies
 you
 invest


in.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 the
 I
 heard
 Sir
 Michael
 at


Sequoia
 say
 something
 that
 was
 like


there's
 only
 one
 founder.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 it
 was
 at
 he
 said
 it
 at
 a
 founder


event
 and
 I
 was
 like
 that's
 rude.


There's
 lots
 of
 co-founders
 here.
 And


now
 a
 decade
 later
 I'm
 like
 of
 course


there
 is
 only
 one
 co-founder
 that
 goes


the
 distance
 because
 ultimately
 as
 you


scale
 the
 org
 it
 only
 makes
 sense
 to


have
 one
 person
 on
 top.
 Yeah.
 Um
 so


>> I
 think
 that's
 just
 the
 reality
 and
 uh


you
 know
 it's
 good
 to
 know
 that
 going


into
 starting
 a
 business.
 Uh
 in
 terms
 of


who
 to
 pick,
 my
 advice
 is
 you
 pick


someone
 you
 want
 to
 get
 married
 to


>> and
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 all
 the
 same


relationship
 issues
 you
 have
 with
 a


partner.
 uh
 you
 know,
 no
 makeup
 sex,
 but


it's
 still
 like
 uh
 yeah,
 there's
 highs,


lows,
 and
 you
 want
 someone
 that


ultimately
 you
 you
 really
 deeply
 trust


because
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 stress
 and


>> um
 challenges,
 but
 as
 long
 as
 you
 trust


the
 foundation,
 then
 you
 got
 a
 good
 a


good
 thing
 to
 build
 on.
 I
 would
 say,
 you


know,
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 I
 if
 I
 called
 a


mistake
 at
 Thumbtac,
 uh
 because
 I
 love


my
 founders,
 but
 it's
 something
 I


wouldn't
 recommend
 others
 do
 is
 we
 had


four
 co-founders
 and
 one
 was
 technical.


He
 left
 after
 like
 two
 years
 and
 then


the
 other
 three
 were
 non-technical.
 This


is
 like
 the
 most
 idiotic
 way
 to
 start
 a


technology
 business,
 but
 we
 had
 no
 idea


what
 we're
 doing
 and
 uh
 you
 know,
 it


worked
 out.
 And
 how
 did
 you
 divide
 and


and
 conquer
 between
 those
 three


non-technical


>> uh
 we
 just
 kind
 of
 jumped
 on
 things
 is


like
 whoever
 was
 good
 at
 something


>> but
 it
 was
 no
 like
 clear
 executive.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 uh
 you
 know


that's
 not
 recommended
 because
 there's


like
 it's
 obvious
 how
 that
 could
 create


tension.
 We
 worked
 through
 it
 but
 um


that's
 why
 it's
 non
 non-standard
 not


best
 practice.


>> Right.
 Right.
 But
 um
 I'm
 going
 back
 to


the
 original
 story
 because
 I
 remember


there's
 this
 uh


>> you
 got
 into
 GSB
 and
 you
 were
 going
 to


go
 to
 grad
 school,
 but
 you
 you
 know
 had


your
 buddies
 from
 college
 and
 you
 were


thinking
 of
 starting
 this
 this
 business


which
 wasn't
 even
 like
 a
 personal
 pain


point.
 You
 just
 thought
 it'd
 be
 a
 good


business


>> and
 you
 uh
 emailed
 the
 you
 know
 let
 the


GSP
 people
 know
 you
 weren't
 going
 to


accept
 it
 and
 and
 they
 sent
 you
 back


this
 very
 immoralizing
 email
 of
 how


you're
 making
 the
 biggest
 mistake
 in


your
 life.


>> Um
 etc.
 you
 know,
 it
 turned
 out
 pretty


good,
 but
 h
 how
 do
 you
 Pretty
 good


decision.
 Um,
 how
 did
 you
 at
 the
 time


think
 about
 get
 enough
 conviction
 to
 to


take
 the
 leap
 and
 do
 it?


>> Yeah,
 it
 was
 scary.
 I
 uh
 got
 into,
 you


know,
 this
 good
 school.
 Seemed
 like
 that


was
 a
 safe
 bet.
 I
 knew
 I
 wanted
 to
 start


a
 business
 and
 uh,
 you
 know,
 if
 I
 went


to
 business
 school,
 I
 knew
 that
 I'd
 have


all
 this
 debt.
 I
 probably
 might
 need
 to


get
 a
 nice
 paying
 job
 afterwards.
 And
 if


I
 was
 going
 to
 go
 for
 it,
 I
 should


probably
 just
 go
 for
 it.
 But
 yeah,
 when


the
 dean
 sent
 me
 that
 email,
 I
 was
 like,


this
 is
 biggest
 mistake
 of
 your
 life.
 He


said
 something
 like
 uh
 you
 can
 startups


will
 come
 and
 go,
 but
 you
 can
 only
 come


to
 Stanford
 once
 or
 something.
 This
 is
 a


once
 in
 a
 lifetime
 opportunity.
 I
 never


responded
 and
 I
 have
 it
 as
 a
 email
 in
 my


this
 save
 that
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 respond


to
 whenever
 Thumbtac
 goes
 public
 and
 be


like,
 I
 made
 the
 right
 decision.
 Uh,
 and


you
 know,
 I
 have
 nothing
 against
 this


guy.
 He's
 just
 doing
 his
 job,
 but
 it's


good
 to
 have
 a
 little
 uh
 chips
 on
 your


shoulder.


>> Yeah,
 totally.
 Okay,
 so
 there's
 EAS
 and


then
 there
 chiefs
 of
 staffs.


>> How
 should
 we
 think
 about
 sort
 of
 the


the
 difference
 there?
 And
 what's
 really


important
 to
 get
 right
 in
 chief
 of


staff?
 It's
 it's
 a
 role
 that
 everyone
 in


addition
 to
 EA
 wishes
 they
 they
 had
 um


but
 seems
 hard
 to
 find
 the
 right
 person.


>> Yeah,
 there's
 no
 formal
 definition.
 And


I
 think
 it's
 something
 that
 uh
 an
 EA
 is


typically
 more
 administrative
 and
 taking


things
 off
 your
 plate
 and
 uh
 chief
 of


staff
 is
 more
 offensive
 and
 it's
 the


type
 of
 person
 who
 can
 follow
 you
 into


meetings.
 You
 could
 deploy
 to
 hey
 like


actually
 take
 this
 meeting
 for
 me
 or
 hey


this
 problem
 came
 up
 uh
 today
 go
 figure


out
 how
 to
 solve
 it.
 And
 so
 a
 chief
 of


staff
 typically
 has
 the
 capabilities
 to


become
 a
 founder
 themselves.
 and
 the


only
 reason
 they
 take
 the
 job
 as
 chief


of
 staff
 is
 so
 they
 can
 see
 what
 it's


like
 to
 be
 a
 founder
 so
 they
 can
 go
 off


uh
 to
 do
 it.
 So
 you
 kind
 of
 get
 people


who
 do
 more
 tours
 of
 duty
 and
 you
 get


super
 high
 capability
 uh
 but
 you
 don't


get
 the
 same
 longevity
 as
 a
 assistant.


What
 have
 you
 looked
 for
 in
 chief
 of


staff
 or
 what's
 sort
 of
 the
 right,
 you


know,
 there's
 sort
 of
 this
 tension


between,
 you
 know,
 getting
 someone


younger
 who's,
 you
 know,
 definitely


initially
 going
 to
 do
 it
 for
 for
 a


couple
 years
 um
 and
 is
 more
 ambitious


versus
 someone
 who's
 been
 more
 seasoned


but
 maybe
 not
 as
 high
 slope
 or


something.
 How
 do
 you
 think
 about


>> The
 way
 I
 break
 it
 down
 is
 assistant,


you
 find
 someone
 you
 want
 to
 go
 a
 decade


with.
 Uh
 the
 intimacy
 and
 the


compounding
 of
 that
 relationship
 is


super
 important.
 And
 so
 you
 go
 deep
 and


that
 means
 you
 probably
 don't
 find
 a


founder
 because
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 be


excited
 to
 do
 this.
 It's
 someone
 who's


much
 more
 of
 a
 caretaker
 and
 is
 excited


to
 be
 number
 two.
 And
 then
 a
 chief
 of


staff
 I
 do
 pure
 slope
 where
 you
 know
 the


person
 is
 going
 to
 move
 on
 in
 a
 couple


years
 but
 they
 have
 yeah
 they
 could


start
 a
 business
 but
 instead
 you
 get


them
 by
 your
 side
 to
 help
 solve


problems.
 And
 there
 there
 are
 people
 you


know
 like
 Lonsdale
 maybe
 like
 a
 lot
 or


something
 who
 have
 you
 know
 chief
 of


staff
 for
 like
 a
 year
 or
 two
 and
 then


they
 start
 a
 company
 then
 they
 invest
 in


them
 and
 they
 build
 kind
 of
 this


reputation
 for
 for
 doing
 and
 then
 they


have
 sort
 of
 these
 like
 you
 know
 um


alumni
 almost
 chief
 of
 staff
 just
 kind


of
 you
 know
 Peter
 Teals
 just
 kind
 of


further


>> yeah
 Bezos
 has
 this
 someone
 follows
 him


around
 that
 goes
 to
 every
 meeting
 and


yeah
 it's
 cool


>> yeah
 let
 let's
 talk
 about
 some
 some


people
 who
 get
 an
 enormous
 amount
 done


and
 I'm
 curious
 what
 are
 lessons
 that
 we


can
 draw
 from
 them.
 Whether
 it's
 someone


like
 Lonsdale,
 whether
 it's
 someone
 like


Elon,
 whether
 it's
 someone
 like
 Sam


Alman,
 who
 who
 are
 folks
 that
 you've


particularly
 learned
 something
 from
 even


just
 watching
 from
 afar
 of
 like
 how
 do


they
 build
 their
 world?
 How
 do
 they


operate?
 I'll
 just
 say
 one
 for
 for


someone
 like
 Londale
 Til
 has
 done
 this


really
 well.
 They
 sort
 of
 compound
 these


certain
 talent
 networks.
 So,
 you
 know,


whether
 it's
 like
 Stanford
 Review
 or


just
 Stanford
 in
 general,
 um
 they're


often
 hiring
 people
 from
 there
 and
 then


involved
 in
 sort
 of
 these
 talent


pipelines.
 they
 sort
 of,
 you
 know,


created,
 you
 know,
 they're
 deep
 in
 the


hackathon
 scene,
 but
 they
 just
 kind
 of


build
 this
 proprietary
 compounding
 sort


of
 talent
 base
 that
 they're
 constantly,


you
 know,
 sort
 of
 um


>> I
 mean,
 the
 talent
 access
 is
 part
 of
 it.


I
 think
 the
 other
 thing
 is
 there
 are


some
 people
 who
 have
 just
 limitless


ambition
 and
 you're
 very
 much
 this
 way


of
 like,
 well,
 what
 if
 I
 could
 do
 10


times
 more
 things?
 Yeah.


>> And
 I
 think
 lots
 of
 people
 uh
 just
 think


that's
 impossible.


>> Um
 but
 it's
 not.
 it
 is
 possible
 and
 uh


with
 delegation
 and
 empowerment
 you
 can


just
 keep
 compounding
 bigger
 and
 bigger


scale.
 The
 other
 thing
 that's


interesting
 that
 we've
 seen
 from
 working


with
 these
 like
 power
 delegators
 is


people
 assume
 that
 uh
 people
 of
 uh
 great


power
 or
 wealth
 or
 uh
 resources
 can


afford
 this
 team
 and
 then
 that
 uh
 is
 why


they
 have
 this
 ambition.
 But
 we've


actually
 seen
 the
 opposite
 is
 the
 case


is
 as
 people
 get
 more
 leverage
 with


assistant,
 their
 ambition
 increases.


Yeah.


>> And
 it's
 difficult
 to
 have
 big
 ambition.


If
 you're
 just
 weighed
 down
 by
 DMV
 forms


and
 passports,
 but
 once
 that's
 off
 your


plate,
 then
 you
 raise
 your
 sights
 and


you
 can
 be
 more
 ambitious
 and
 you
 know,


then
 you
 go
 from
 assistant
 to
 a
 chief
 of


staff
 and
 you
 just
 keep
 leveling
 up
 to,


you
 know,
 until
 you're
 lonsdale
 or
 the


president.
 I
 I
 think
 another
 thing
 I've


admired
 about
 some
 of
 these
 people
 is


they
 um


>> you
 know
 they
 remark
 hold
 remarkably
 few


grudges
 like
 um
 you
 know
 apparently
 you


know
 Peter
 Teio
 like
 kicked
 Elon
 out
 of


PayPal
 or
 something
 or
 you
 know
 like
 a


lot
 of
 these
 people
 have
 had
 beefs
 you


know
 decades
 ago


>> and
 yet
 he
 ended
 up
 funding
 his
 next


company
 and
 so
 people
 have
 very
 short


memories
 if
 if
 someone
 you
 know


mistreats
 them
 or
 they
 make
 a
 mist


mistake
 or
 something
 they're
 quick
 to


reconcile
 and
 just
 do
 business
 again


over
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look
 what
 uh
 President


Vance
 said
 about
 President
 Trump
 before


they
 were
 partners.
 It's
 I
 think
 there's


>> Trump's
 actually
 quite
 forgiving
 or
 you


know, a
 lot of
 people
 say
 a
 lot
 of
 bad


things
 about
 him
 and
 he'll
 continue
 to


work
 with
 them
 as
 long
 as
 they
 change


their
 mind.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 there's
 just
 a
 desire
 to


win
 uh
 at
 all
 costs
 and
 uh
 yeah,
 grudges


are
 not
 helpful.


>> Yeah.
 Even
 Trump
 and
 Elon,
 right?
 You


getting
 into
 it
 and
 you
 know,


reconciling,


you
 know,
 TVD
 where
 it
 stands
 by
 by
 the


time
 this
 comes
 out.
 And
 and
 then
 there


are
 some
 people
 who
 seem
 to
 have
 pretty


like
 uh
 you
 know
 Bill
 Gates
 has
 like
 you


know
 pretty
 big
 team,
 pretty
 big


operation.


>> Um
 but
 then
 it
 seemed
 like
 Bezos
 and


Elon
 maybe
 have
 like
 pretty
 lean
 and
 so


yeah
 I'm
 curious
 how
 you
 think
 about


sort
 of


>> I
 mean
 Elon's
 the
 one
 that
 makes
 no


sense.
 It's
 he
 claims
 to
 not
 have
 an


assistant
 and
 to
 be
 like
 scheduling


stuff.
 There's
 a
 story
 of
 Bill
 Gates


being
 like
 trying
 to
 schedule
 a
 meeting


with
 Elon.
 and
 he's
 like,
 "Connect
 me


with
 your
 assistant."
 And
 Elon's
 like,


"No,
 I
 am
 my
 assistant."
 Uh,
 it's
 I
 I


hardly
 believe
 it,
 but
 Elon's
 just


insane.
 So
 maybe
 he
 is
 that
 that
 way.
 I


think
 most
 normal
 humans,
 if
 you
 want
 to


get
 leverage,
 you
 have
 to
 delegate.
 I


mean,
 the
 one
 of
 the
 cool


>> personal
 teams
 I
 saw
 is
 this
 guy
 who's
 a


billionaire.
 He's
 runs
 this
 hedge
 fund


and
 he
 has
 a
 team
 of
 40.
 Uh
 he
 has
 eight


personal
 uh
 executive
 assistants.
 The


all
 of
 the
 executive
 assistants
 graduate


from
 Princeton.
 insanely
 high
 bar.
 And
 I


was
 asking
 this
 woman
 who
 managed
 the
 EA


team
 like,
 "How
 do
 you
 decide
 what
 to


prioritize
 your
 team
 on?"
 And
 she's


like,
 "If
 my
 team
 can
 spend
 one
 day


saving
 my
 uh
 principal
 one
 minute,
 it's


well
 worth
 our
 time."
 And
 I'm
 like,
 that


is
 so
 next
 level
 and
 definitely
 like


that's
 something
 I
 would
 love
 to
 aspire


to,
 but
 it's
 just,
 you
 know,


>> the
 the
 the
 billionaire
 budget.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 pretty
 funny.
 Um
 also
 just
 in


terms
 of
 prioritiz
 like
 um
 you
 know


we're
 hiring
 you
 know
 assistants
 here


and
 someone
 was
 saying
 oh
 you
 know
 do


you
 want
 them
 to
 be
 in
 all
 meetings
 with


you
 and
 I
 was
 like
 well
 if
 they're
 in


meetings
 with
 me
 then
 they're
 not


working
 like
 I
 want
 them
 to
 be
 like
 you


know
 finding
 ways
 to
 give
 me
 leverage


and
 take
 things
 off
 my


>> plate.
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 one
 of
 our
 visions


at
 Athena
 is
 that
 you
 can
 have
 digital


assistants
 that
 listen
 to
 you
 and
 work


with
 you
 and
 are
 connected
 to
 your
 Zoom


and
 your
 inbox
 and
 your
 calendar
 and
 can


be
 mining
 all
 of
 that
 digital
 exhaust


for
 things
 your
 assistant
 should
 work


on.
 And
 so
 I
 mean
 your
 assistant
 can't


possibly
 sit
 in
 every
 meeting
 if
 they're


going
 to
 do
 anything,
 but
 if
 the
 digital


uh
 the
 machine
 assistants
 are
 surveying


it
 and
 pulling
 things
 out,
 that's
 a


pretty
 cool
 combination.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 think
 it's
 interesting
 to


look
 at
 how
 people
 build
 out
 their


univer
 like
 for
 example,
 you
 know,
 Mark


and
 Ben


>> funnel
 everything
 through
 as
 Z
 and
 are


all
 in
 on
 Z
 and
 of
 course
 have,
 you


know,
 other
 intellectual
 or


philanthropic
 interests,
 but
 mostly
 it's


like
 consolidate.
 Whereas
 someone
 like


Peter
 Teal
 has
 this
 um
 he
 sort
 of


fragments
 it
 a
 bit
 more
 you
 know
 like
 um


you
 know
 founders
 fund
 but
 then
 other


several
 other
 you
 know
 myith
 several


other
 funds
 other
 company
 all
 sorts
 of


like
 um
 initiatives
 that
 are
 you
 know


somewhat
 collaborative
 but
 independent.


Yeah.
 Um
 and
 he
 he
 sits
 on
 top
 but
 also


it
 seems
 like
 he
 lets
 them
 you
 know
 he's


not
 like
 CEO
 of
 of
 of
 them.
 Um,
 and
 he's


got
 this
 sort
 of
 talent,
 you
 know,


network
 that
 he's
 worked
 with
 for
 a
 long


time
 that
 kind
 of
 like,
 uh,
 you
 know,


goes
 in
 almost
 boomerangs
 across
 the
 the


universe.


um
 lonsdale
 feels
 like
 he's
 more
 hands


he's
 got
 the
 HBC
 universe
 but
 then
 his


his
 um
 other
 initiative
 he's
 like
 quick


to
 institutionalize
 something
 whether


it's
 like
 a
 think
 tank
 or
 like
 you
 know


it's
 no
 coincidence
 that
 you
 know
 Peter


Teal
 would
 do
 the
 sort
 of
 teal


fellowship
 and
 la
 create
 a
 university
 or


something
 teal
 is
 almost
 like
 early
 to


stuff
 he
 creates
 a
 format
 for
 something


um
 a
 template
 you
 know
 he
 does
 the
 hard


work
 of
 sort
 of
 um
 you
 know
 field


building
 intellect
 or
 like
 you
 know
 uh


doing
 something
 that's
 in
 a


controversial
 space
 or
 it's
 longevity
 or


charter
 cities
 or
 um
 you
 know
 higher


education
 and
 then
 um
 you
 know
 people


like
 Lonsdale
 institutionalize
 it
 to
 to


some
 degree.
 Um
 and
 then
 yeah
 Elon
 you


know
 it's
 been
 described
 also
 has
 this


like
 SWAT
 team


>> um
 you
 know
 of
 of
 people
 that
 help
 him


from
 from
 company
 to
 company
 and
 he's


just
 able
 to
 recruit
 you
 know


world-class
 people
 to
 to
 lead
 these


efforts.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 it
 comes
 it's
 like
 what's


the
 right
 org
 structure?
 There's


actually
 no
 right
 or
 structure.
 It's


what's
 the
 right
 or
 structure
 for
 you
 as


a
 founder
 and
 you
 know
 Mark
 Andre
 and


Ben
 Horowitz
 are
 company
 builders
 and
 so


they're
 building
 their
 leverage
 like
 a


company.
 The
 A16Z
 is
 a
 company.


>> Uh
 not
 that
 Peter
 Teal
 is
 not
 an


entrepreneur
 but
 he's
 more
 of
 a


philosopher
 today
 and
 so
 his
 uh
 system


is
 more
 like
 a
 philosopher.
 It's
 all


these
 kind
 of
 wild
 and
 crazy
 ideas.
 Uh,


and
 so
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 Jensen
 Hang


has
 like
 46
 direct
 reports
 or
 something,


which
 is
 absolutely
 insane,
 but
 it
 works


for
 him.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 you
 just
 have
 to


know
 what
 your
 style
 is
 and
 then
 you


build
 it
 for
 you.


>> Totally.
 And
 someone
 like,
 you
 know,
 Sam


Alman
 is
 like
 a
 dealmaker
 and
 a


fundraiser


>> and
 a
 talent
 identifier,
 you
 know,
 and


so
 he's
 able
 to
 like
 I
 remember
 he
 was


at
 YC
 and
 he
 was
 talking
 to
 my
 one
 of
 my


friends
 about
 sort
 of
 this
 universal


basic
 income
 company.
 My
 friend
 didn't


end
 up
 doing
 it,
 but
 I
 was
 like, "Huh,


that's
 interesting.
 Why
 is
 why
 is
 he


even
 doing
 that?"
 He's
 like
 focused
 on


waste
 and
 he's
 like


>> he
 he
 has
 a
 knack
 for
 for
 good
 ideas.
 He


has
 a
 knack
 for
 and
 this
 person
 was
 like


22.
 He
 has
 a
 knack
 for
 you
 know
 uh
 high


slope
 talent
 and
 he
 has
 a
 superpower


around
 raising
 money.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I


think
 new
 founders
 or
 at least
 me
 as
 a


new
 founder
 was
 like
 okay
 what
 are
 my


weaknesses
 and
 how
 do
 I
 get
 better
 at


them?


>> But
 then
 a
 second
 time
 founder
 is
 like


forget
 all
 of
 my
 weaknesses.
 I'm
 just


not
 even
 going
 to
 try.
 I'm
 just
 going
 to


be
 really
 good
 at
 my
 strengths
 and
 I'm


going
 to
 hire
 other
 people
 to
 do
 all
 the


things
 I'm
 not
 good
 at.
 And
 that
 is
 way


more
 effective.


>> Yeah,
 totally.
 The
 um
 there
 used
 to
 be


this
 sort
 of
 skepticism
 of
 like
 hey
 you


can't
 really
 and
 there
 still
 is
 actually


you
 can't
 really
 incubate
 company
 like


this
 the
 CEO
 has
 to
 be
 the
 co-
 the


founder
 they
 have
 to
 drive
 it
 to
 where


do
 you
 stand
 on
 on
 kind
 of
 that
 that


debate.


>> I
 think
 the
 biggest
 companies
 aren't


incubated
 because
 the
 biggest
 companies


have
 a
 founder
 who
 is
 monomomaniacal


from
 the
 beginning
 and
 compounds
 it
 for


50
 years.


>> Yeah
 totally


>> and
 that's
 not
 incubation.
 incubation
 is


kind
 of
 let
 me
 uh
 try
 a
 bunch
 of
 thing.


It's
 not
 this
 monomomaniacal
 power
 law


commitment.
 So
 if
 you're
 just
 trying
 to


build
 a
 trillion
 dollar
 business,
 I


think
 that's
 not
 the
 way
 to
 do
 it.


>> But
 look,
 if
 you
 like,
 you
 know,
 we
 have


a
 mutual
 friend
 who
 likes
 to
 remain


anonymous
 who
 incubates
 lots
 of


companies
 and
 he
 launches
 four
 companies


a
 year


>> and
 he
 loves
 doing
 it
 and
 he's
 going
 to


make
 a
 ton
 of
 money
 doing
 it
 and
 that's


just
 his
 style.
 Well,
 he's
 not
 going
 to


probably
 have
 trillion
 dollar


businesses,
 but
 he's
 going
 to
 have
 50,


you
 know,
 hundred
 million
 dollar


businesses,
 which
 is
 still
 incredible,


>> right?
 Yeah.
 I
 think
 one
 bookcase
 is


more
 of
 it's
 like
 uh
 breeding
 like,
 you


know,
 Sam
 Alman
 in
 some
 sense
 incubated


OpenAI
 and
 that
 it
 wasn't
 the
 main
 thing


he
 was
 working
 on,
 but
 then
 once
 he


identified
 that
 it
 could
 be,
 you
 know,


this
 massive
 opportunity
 then
 then
 went


all
 in
 all
 in
 with
 it.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 it's
 more
 like
 a


venture
 portfolio
 and
 you
 know
 there's


probably
 a
 bunch
 of
 stuff
 Peter
 Teal
 has


done
 that
 we
 don't
 even
 remember
 uh


because
 like
 sea
 studying
 and
 things


like
 that
 because
 they
 just
 disappear


into
 the
 ether
 and
 then
 things
 that
 work


compound
 and
 so
 yeah
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 have


the
 resources
 to
 launch
 10
 new
 things


and
 then
 just
 double
 down
 on
 the
 one


thing
 that's
 big
 every
 year
 that's
 a


cool
 cool
 approach


>> right
 a
 decade
 ago
 Mark
 Andre
 wrote
 this


blog
 post
 on
 productivity


>> and
 they
 were
 asking
 him
 how
 you
 think


about
 you
 meetings,
 scheduling,


whatever.
 And
 he
 said,
 "You
 know what?
 I


try
 not
 to
 schedule
 things
 in
 advance


because
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 I'll
 feel,
 you


know,
 next
 week
 and
 I
 want
 kind
 of
 want


to
 do
 things
 like
 in
 flow."
 And
 so
 when,


you
 know,
 people
 are
 trying
 to
 get
 my


time,
 what
 I
 typically
 say
 is
 like,


"Call
 me
 right
 now


>> or


>> feel
 free
 to
 check
 in


>> next
 week
 and
 we'll
 see
 how
 I
 feel."


>> Yeah.


>> And
 it
 kind
 of
 is
 like
 better
 aligned


with
 sort
 of
 the
 flow
 state.
 Um,
 and


>> I
 mean
 that's
 the
 ultimate
 flex.
 It's


like
 if
 if
 you
 can
 pull
 that
 off,
 that


is
 definitely
 the
 ultimate
 way
 to
 live


is
 you
 just
 work
 on
 whatever
 you
 want.


The
 world
 opens
 up
 to
 you.
 You
 call


>> obviously
 it's
 hard
 for
 most
 uh
 new


mortals
 to
 pull
 off.
 But
 yeah,
 if
 you


can
 get
 to
 that
 level,
 that
 is
 the


dream,


>> right?
 So
 then
 I
 I
 was
 for
 certain,
 you


know,
 meetings
 that
 people
 cold
 reaching


out
 or
 whatever.
 supposed
 to
 kind
 of


try.
 It's
 It's
 like
 um
 I
 always


anticipate
 that
 in
 a
 few
 more
 days
 I'll


be
 like
 busier
 than
 I
 am
 or
 something
 or


I'll
 have
 whereas
 like
 right
 now,
 yeah,


I
 got
 time.
 Give
 me
 a
 call.
 Um
 but
 so
 I


I
 tried
 that
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 then
 I


Mark
 did
 a
 follow-up
 interview
 uh
 where


someone
 asked
 him
 about
 that.
 Sure.
 Um


um
 and
 he
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 you
 know,
 that


didn't
 work."
 Like
 I
 I
 tried
 but
 that


didn't
 work.
 Now
 I'm
 just
 scheduled


everything


>> just
 back
 toback
 all
 day
 long.


>> I
 was
 like, "Oh,
 god
 damn
 it.
 You've


been
 doing
 that."
 Um,
 and
 it's
 um,
 but


he's,
 you
 know,
 he's
 also
 mastered
 uh,


multitasking.
 And


>> I
 mean,
 I
 think
 people
 just,
 uh,
 the


thing
 I
 think
 you
 can
 learn
 from
 Mark


and
 other
 people
 is
 just,
 uh,
 challenge


the
 defaults
 occasionally.
 And
 if
 you're


in
 backto-back
 meetings
 all
 the
 time,


try
 this
 other
 system
 and
 see
 see
 if
 it


works.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 most
 people
 just
 go


with
 the
 flow.
 I
 think
 other
 thing
 is


most
 people
 aren't
 vicious
 enough
 at


saying
 no.
 Yeah.


>> And
 just
 being
 super
 hardcore
 is
 like,


is
 that
 conference
 you're
 going
 to


matter?
 Is
 that
 random?
 get
 to
 know
 you


chat
 mean
 anything?
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 you


just
 say
 no
 to
 most
 things.
 Um,
 you


know,
 I've


>> back
 in
 the
 Uber
 vers
 uh
 really
 scaling


war
 days,
 I
 remember
 emailing
 Logan
 a


question
 um
 probably
 to
 come
 to
 one
 of


our
 dinners
 and
 he
 just
 responded
 war


mode.


>> And
 I
 love
 that.
 And
 I'm
 like,
 well,


most
 people
 should
 actually
 be
 in
 war


mode
 like
 90%
 of
 the
 time.
 And
 that
 same


>> Yeah.
 hardcornness
 is
 just
 like
 the


right
 way
 to
 operate.


>> Yeah.
 What
 have
 you
 learned
 in
 your


extensive
 founder
 career
 about
 uh


managing
 your
 own
 psychology,
 dealing


with
 stress,


>> dealing
 with
 the
 cognitive
 dissonance


of,
 you
 know,
 having
 to
 present


externally
 like
 things
 are
 amazing
 even


when,
 you
 know,
 you're
 concerned
 about


Google,
 you
 know,
 taking
 out
 your


business.
 Um
 what
 um
 what
 advice
 might


you
 have
 for
 others
 in
 terms
 of


cultivating
 this?
 Uh


>> yeah,
 man.
 I
 think
 it's
 like
 a
 cold


plunge
 or
 something.
 It's
 just
 you
 just


shock
 therapy
 and
 eventually
 you
 it's


just
 like
 you're
 bathed
 in
 existential


fear
 all
 the
 time
 and
 you're
 like


whatever,
 let's
 bring
 it
 on.
 Totally.


>> Uh


>> I
 don't
 think
 there's
 there's
 much
 other


than
 knowing
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 happen.


There's
 going
 to
 be
 tons
 of
 ups
 and


downs.
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 clear
 lessons


from
 Thumbtac,
 which
 is
 now
 scaled
 and


and
 done
 so
 well,
 was
 that
 like
 there


was
 lots
 of
 near
 misses
 where
 we
 almost


died
 times
 where
 we
 thought
 it
 wasn't


going
 to
 work.
 And
 it's
 like
 you
 just


got
 to
 stay
 in
 the
 game.
 Yeah.


>> And
 if
 you
 can
 stay
 in
 the
 game,
 you
 can


eventually
 win.
 Yeah.
 And
 I
 think


Thumbtac
 was
 very
 good
 at
 staying
 in
 the


game
 so
 that
 we
 can
 eventually
 win.


>> Um


>> Yeah.
 It's
 funny.
 There's
 like
 degrees


of
 panic
 in
 the
 beginning.
 You
 know,


you're
 getting
 your
 feet
 wet.
 It's
 like,


"Oh
 my
 god,
 someone
 said
 something
 mean


about
 me
 on
 the
 internet.
 And
 then
 it's


like,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 someone
 wants
 to
 like


leave
 my
 company."


>> And
 then
 it's
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 um,


we're,
 you
 know,
 we
 might
 die.
 We
 only


six
 months
 of
 payroll."
 Then
 it's
 like,


"Oh
 my
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 sued."


>> Like,
 you
 know,


>> well,
 it's
 like
 the
 first
 time
 you
 get


sued
 or
 you're
 worried
 about
 getting


sued
 and
 then
 eventually
 you
 have
 a


board
 meeting
 and
 there's
 just
 a
 list
 of


lawsuits
 and
 it's
 just
 you
 revict
 them


quarterly.
 It's
 just
 like
 that's


actually
 what
 success
 is
 is
 like
 you're


gonna
 have
 that
 stuff
 constantly
 and
 it


becomes
 Yeah.
 Just
 part
 of
 business.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 you
 just
 keep
 building


up
 more
 uh
 capacity
 uh
 to
 handle
 these


things
 and
 they,
 you
 know,
 just


>> Yeah.
 That's
 where
 like
 I
 think


co-founders
 are
 the
 best
 is
 is
 like
 it's


the
 people
 you
 can
 be
 totally
 open
 with


and
 be
 like,
 well,
 that
 situation's


effed
 up.
 What?
 And
 someone
 you
 can


trust
 and


>> totally


>> be
 on
 the
 ups
 and
 downs
 with.


>> Let's
 go
 to
 Athena
 and
 let's
 go
 where
 we


started,
 which
 is
 sort
 of
 the


intersection
 between
 uh
 humans
 and
 AI.


How
 have
 you
 thought
 about
 building


Athena
 given
 sort
 of
 developments
 in
 AI


and
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 for
 for
 Athena


started
 fully
 bootstrapped
 human
 only


scaled
 to
 a
 thousand
 people
 no
 outside


capital
 and
 then
 we
 had
 this
 AI
 moment
 a


few
 years
 ago
 and
 it
 was
 clear
 we
 could


uh
 make
 a
 big
 AI
 play
 and
 this
 could


become
 a
 generational
 business
 or
 we


could
 get
 railroaded
 by
 AI
 and
 so
 only


one
 option
 there
 is
 go
 big
 and
 uh
 our


vision
 here
 is
 this
 uh
 is
 you
 take
 the


best
 of
 a
 human
 and
 best
 of
 a
 machine


wrap
 it
 into
 one
 unified
 product
 and


what
 the
 machine
 does
 will
 increase
 over


time
 just
 like
 a
 self-driving
 car
 and
 so


the
 humans
 the
 UX
 it's
 on
 top
 uh
 it
 will


become
 more
 the
 human
 assistant
 will


focus
 more
 on
 project
 management
 and


highle
 uh
 work
 uh
 and
 really
 be
 that


like
 caretaker
 that
 empathy
 that
 partner


and
 then
 the
 machine
 will
 increasingly


do
 the
 more
 row
 mechanical


administrative
 stuff
 and
 you
 know
 just


as
 when
 you
 get
 into
 a
 Tesla,
 uh,
 you


know,
 Elon
 made
 them
 with
 wheels,
 so


with
 steering
 wheels,
 so
 you
 could
 drive


them
 because
 they
 don't
 drive


themselves,
 uh,
 when
 he
 started,
 but


every
 time
 you
 get
 in
 the
 car,
 you're


actually
 teaching
 the
 machine
 how
 to


drive.
 Yeah.


>> And
 these
 models
 don't,
 uh,
 generalize


well.
 You
 have
 to
 bring
 edge
 cases
 under


distribution.
 And
 so
 every
 time
 you


drive,
 the
 uh,
 the
 model
 gets
 more


powerful.
 And
 the
 same
 is
 true
 in
 um,


executive
 assistant.
 Our
 humans
 are


driving.
 They're
 doing
 the
 tasks,
 but


we're
 building
 machine
 models
 that
 are


being
 improved
 by
 the
 way
 they
 act.
 And


so
 the
 more
 your
 assistant
 does
 tasks


for
 you,
 the
 more
 our
 models
 will


improve
 and
 that'll
 allow
 the
 human
 to


upgrade
 what
 they
 they
 work
 on
 to
 more


high
 leverage
 stuff.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 that's
 exciting.
 So
 what
 what


else
 uh
 can
 you
 share
 about
 plugs
 for


the
 company
 or
 things
 to
 watch
 out
 for


or
 for
 people
 who
 you
 know
 want
 to
 get


assistance,
 you
 know?
 Yeah,
 look
 it
 uh
 I


just
 say
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 an
 assistant,


you
 are
 the
 assistant.
 Step
 one,
 uh
 if


you're
 starting
 a
 business,
 you
 should


hire
 assistant.
 And
 if
 you've
 got
 20


bucks
 a
 month,
 use
 Chat
 GPT.
 Yeah.
 If


you've
 got,
 you
 know,
 10
 bucks
 an
 hour,


go
 on
 to
 Upwork
 and
 hire
 someone


yourself.
 Uh
 if
 you
 hire
 someone


yourself,
 I
 would
 say
 my
 main


recommendation
 is
 you
 need
 to
 interview


a
 lot
 of
 people.
 Uh
 you
 know,
 Athena,
 we


have


>> 50,000
 assistants
 apply
 per
 month
 and
 we


put
 them
 through
 a
 huge
 battery
 of
 tests


and
 we
 hire
 like
 one
 in
 300.
 So,
 if


you're
 going
 to
 hire
 on
 yourself,
 make


sure
 you
 interview
 not
 10,
 but
 probably


like
 50
 people.
 Uh,
 if
 you
 have
 the


resources
 for
 $3,000
 a
 month,
 then
 you


should
 work
 with
 a
 company
 like
 Athena


who
 can
 recruit,
 train,
 manage,
 and


teach
 you
 how
 to
 delegate.
 And
 then
 when


you
 have
 the
 resources
 for
 an
 in-person


assistant,
 uh,
 100
 150k
 a
 year,
 you


should
 do
 that
 as
 well.
 Um,
 and
 then


ultimately,
 you
 know,
 when
 you
 get
 later


stage,
 you
 have
 a
 chief
 of
 staff,


inerson
 assistant,
 and,
 you
 know,
 a


fleet
 of
 Athena
 assistants
 in
 the
 cloud.


Yeah,
 that's
 a
 great
 great
 overview.


Well,
 let's
 wrap
 on
 that
 podcast.
