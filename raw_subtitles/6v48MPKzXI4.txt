Let's write an email together, starting with the greeting. Hi, and a first name is probably fine. We're all friends here. Save dear and using someone's title for more formal situations, such as an official briefing or an invitation. The body of our email. Assume that everyone you're communicating with is smarter than you and cares more than you and is busier than you. No jargon, no small talk. You do not have to ask after your recipient's health every time you email them. There is a correct way to sign off an email. It is best wishes. Best and all the best are also acceptable. My email etiquette philosophy is guided by one fundamental principle. Reducing the burden of email as much as possible.
