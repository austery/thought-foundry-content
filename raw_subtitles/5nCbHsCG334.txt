All
 right,
 everybody.
 We're
 thrilled
 to


have
 the
 one,
 the
 only
 Tata
 Nadella


here,
 the
 third
 CEO
 of
 Microsoft
 for
 a


uh
 impromptu
 fireside
 chat
 with
 David


Saxs,
 Arzar
 of
 AI
 and
 crypto.
 Satia


third,
 CEO
 of
 Microsoft,
 born
 in
 India.


What
 an
 incredible
 story.
 came
 here


right
 after
 college
 and
 uh
 you
 had
 a


little
 round
 trip
 to
 pick
 up
 your
 wife


in
 your
 book
 to
 to
 bring
 her
 here.
 Tell


everybody
 briefly
 uh
 how
 that
 occurred.


>> Well
 um
 uh
 you
 know
 so
 that's
 that's
 a


great
 story
 of
 uh
 the
 uh
 the
 labyrinth


that
 is
 the
 immigration
 policies
 of
 the


United
 States
 I
 think.
 Um
 I
 my
 wife
 and


I
 went
 to
 college
 together
 in
 India.
 I


came
 here
 for
 grad
 school.
 We
 then
 got


married.
 Uh
 I
 got
 my
 green
 card.
 Um
 and


she
 couldn't
 come
 join
 because
 we
 got


married.
 So
 the
 story
 goes
 basically
 I


had
 to
 give
 up
 my
 green
 card.
 So
 the


funny
 thing
 is
 I
 went
 to
 the
 American


embassy
 in
 Delhi


>> and
 I
 said
 where's
 the
 line
 to
 give
 up


my
 green
 card?
 And
 they
 said
 there
 is
 no


such
 line.
 Um


>> that
 would
 be
 a
 crazy
 thing
 to
 do
 in
 the


'9s.
 So
 it
 was
 a
 strange
 thing
 to
 give


up
 your
 green
 card,
 get
 an
 H1
 so
 that


she
 could
 join,
 but
 it
 all
 worked
 out.


So
 um
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 long
 lost
 memory


but
 it
 was
 you
 know
 a
 way
 to
 work
 around


it.
 Um
 I
 wanted
 to
 ask
 you
 uh
 having


launched
 a
 co-pilot
 first
 with
 GitHub


then
 having
 a
 co-pilot
 on
 the
 desktop.


You
 made
 a
 very
 bold
 move
 for
 Microsoft


to
 put
 that
 in
 the
 Windows
 product,


which
 I
 use
 every
 day,
 on
 the
 desktop,


but
 you
 did
 that
 before
 it
 really
 could


recognize
 the
 file
 system
 and
 interact


with
 applications.
 Got
 a
 little
 bit
 of a


lukewarm
 reception,
 but
 now
 you've
 been


doubling
 down,
 doubling
 down,
 and
 there


seems
 to
 be,
 in
 my
 estimation,
 three


modalities
 for
 knowledge
 workers.


Elon's
 building
 at
 XAI,


what
 they're
 calling
 a
 human
 emulator,


if
 you
 saw
 that
 leak
 this
 week.
 Yeah.


uh
 where
 they're
 just
 building
 employees


and
 just
 putting
 them
 into
 their
 chat


rooms
 and
 email.
 Then
 you
 have
 Claude


came
 out
 with
 co-work
 this
 week.


Incredibly
 powerful.
 People
 are
 kind
 of


losing
 their
 minds
 over
 it.
 I've
 been


playing
 with
 it
 for
 the
 last
 40
 hours.


Truly
 impressive.


What's
 your
 vision
 for
 Microsoft
 and
 how


knowledge
 workers
 will
 actually
 put
 this


to
 use
 because
 there
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 gap


between
 you
 know
 playing
 around
 with


chatbt
 and
 getting
 some
 interesting


results
 and
 getting
 business
 results.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 think
 it
 one
 of the
 most
 um


perhaps
 illustrative
 examples
 um
 of


trying
 to
 understand
 these
 various
 form


factors
 is
 looking
 at
 coding
 which
 is


obviously
 a
 form
 of
 knowledge
 work
 or
 uh


probably
 the
 best
 example
 of
 knowledge


work
 and
 if
 you
 think
 about
 the
 journey


coding
 has
 been
 it
 started
 with
 u


essentially
 uh
 uh
 the
 next
 edit
 suggest


right
 that
 was
 the
 first
 time
 in
 fact
 my


own
 belief
 in
 this
 entire
 uh
 generation


of
 tech
 really
 sort
 of
 got
 formulated


where
 I
 started
 seeing
 I
 think
 it
 was
 G


you
 know
 there's
 a
 codeex
 model
 back
 in


the
 day
 it
 was
 preGPT35


uh
 that's
 when
 next
 edits
 started


working
 with
 some
 real
 accuracy
 then
 we


went
 to
 chat
 then
 we
 went
 to
 actions
 and


now
 to
 full
 autonomous
 agents
 and
 then


the
 autonomous
 agents
 can
 be
 both


foreground
 background
 in
 the
 cloud
 or


local
 right
 so
 that's
 all
 the
 form


factors
 that
 exist
 today
 when
 you're


coding
 and
 interestingly
 If
 you
 look
 at


it,
 you
 use
 all
 of
 them,
 right?
 It's
 not


like
 there's
 only
 one
 form
 factor.
 So


that's
 I
 think
 probably
 one
 of
 the
 other


lessons.
 So
 for
 example,
 when
 I'm
 in
 a


CLI,
 I
 can
 you
 go
 a
 foreground
 agent,


background
 agent,
 and
 then
 just


literally
 go
 edit
 in
 VS
 Code,
 right?


There
 all
 happening
 in
 parallel,
 right?


So
 that
 sort
 of
 shows
 how
 these
 form


factors
 even
 composed.
 So
 then
 you
 bring


that
 to
 knowledge
 work
 to
 your
 point.
 We


started
 with
 chat.
 chat
 with
 reasoning


sort
 of
 goes
 beyond
 just
 request


response
 because
 you
 now
 have
 that
 chain


of
 thought
 uh
 where
 you
 can
 see
 it
 work


now
 they're
 actions
 right
 essentially


either
 through
 computer
 use
 or
 through


uh
 AP
 you
 know
 basically
 skills
 uh
 and


agent
 calls
 so
 you
 can
 do
 actions
 so


that's
 kind
 of
 the
 state
 of
 the
 copilot


today
 now
 there
 is
 a
 way
 to
 think
 about


you
 know
 the
 the theory
 of
 the
 mind


evolution
 Right?
 Because
 you
 need
 like


if
 you
 remember
 you
 know
 Jobs
 had
 the


best
 line
 I
 would
 say
 for
 PCs
 or


computers
 was
 to
 say
 if
 you
 it's
 a


bicycle
 for
 the
 mind.
 Bill
 had
 a
 line


which
 I
 liked
 as
 well
 which
 was
 it's


information
 at
 your
 fingertips.
 We
 kind


of
 need
 now
 a
 new
 concept
 metaphor
 for


how
 we
 use
 computers
 in
 the
 AI
 age.
 And


you
 have
 one


>> and
 the
 one
 I
 like
 actually
 came
 from


the
 CEO
 of
 notion
 which
 I
 you
 know
 that


manager
 of


>> incredible
 product.
 Yeah.


>> You
 haven't
 bought
 it
 yet?
 I've
 not
 got


that.
 Uh
 but
 the
 it's
 both
 management
 of


you
 know
 basically


a
 manager
 of
 infinite
 minds.
 That's
 a


nice
 way
 to
 think
 about
 it
 right
 when


you
 sort
 of
 really
 look
 at
 all
 the


agents
 that
 you
 are
 working
 with.
 You


kind
 of
 need
 to
 understand
 what
 I
 in


fact
 the
 other
 term
 I
 like
 is
 we
 macro


delegate
 and
 micro
 steer.
 In
 fact
 you


kind
 of
 need
 that
 in
 in in
 coding
 you


kind
 of
 have
 it
 right.
 So
 you
 do
 a
 macro


delegation
 and
 then
 I
 can
 in
 parallel


give
 it
 instructions
 while
 it
 is
 doing


work.
 So
 that's
 sort
 of
 the
 state
 even


today
 of
 co-pilot
 or
 what
 have
 you.
 you


bring
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 what
 one
 of
 one


of the
 form
 factors
 I'm
 very
 excited


about
 and
 you'll
 see
 us
 even
 in
 the
 next


week
 even
 uh
 do
 things
 is
 while
 I'm


sitting
 in
 GitHub
 copilot


what
 it's
 not
 as
 if
 software
 developers


sit
 in
 isolation
 right
 it's
 not
 like
 the


only
 thing
 I
 work
 on
 is
 my
 repo
 I
 attend


meetings
 um
 I
 write
 specs
 or
 others
 have


written
 specs
 that
 I'm
 implementing
 uh
 I


need
 to
 have
 my
 repo
 be
 consistent
 with


that
 so
 that
 means
 using
 either
 a


straightforward
 MCP
 server
 or
 a
 skill
 I


want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 call
 into
 my
 work
 IQ


which
 is
 the
 co-pilot
 bring
 that
 in


that's
 the
 type
 of
 composition
 uh
 of


knowledge
 work
 that'll
 happen
 same
 thing


with
 security
 say
 you're
 a
 security


professional
 you
 have
 lots
 of
 logs
 uh


how
 do
 you
 sort
 of
 really
 analyze
 them


you
 drop
 them
 into
 a
 file
 system
 then


write
 code
 on
 top
 of
 it
 create
 a


dashboard
 what
 have
 you
 those
 are
 the


types
 of
 knowledge
 work
 that
 we
 can


enable
 there
 I
 think
 you
 bring
 up
 one


more
 thing
 which
 is
 can
 you
 create
 quote


unquote
 digital
 employees
 digital


co-workers
 or
 what
 have
 you
 and
 it's
 all


about
 credentials
 right
 so
 the
 I
 today


you
 could
 like
 you
 can
 literally
 assign


>> are
 you
 working
 on
 that
 as
 well


>> yeah
 so
 in
 fact
 we
 introduced
 something


called
 agent
 365
 as
 a
 way
 to
 give


identities
 in
 fact
 extending
 the


identities
 we
 have
 for
 humans
 today
 uh


and
 the
 endpoint
 protection
 we
 have
 for


their
 compute
 devices
 to
 agents
 so


>> so
 you
 might
 clone
 me
 working
 in
 the
 HR


department
 or
 working
 in
 the
 marketing


department
 and
 have
 a
 virtual
 correct


>> version
 of
 me
 inside
 of
 office.


>> That's
 correct.
 So,
 so
 there
 are
 two


sort
 of
 modalities
 there.
 One
 is
 you


give
 every
 knowledge
 worker
 infinite


minds.
 That's
 kind
 of
 one
 and
 then
 you


create
 even
 infinite
 minds
 independent


of
 the
 your
 identity
 because
 the


identity
 is
 one
 of
 the
 key
 things
 you


got
 to
 get
 right
 even
 for
 it
 to
 work


right.
 Right.
 So


>> permissions


>> and
 decision
 making


>> permissions
 decision-
 making
 and
 like


one
 of
 the
 key
 in
 things
 is
 who
 did
 what


to
 whom
 is
 sort
 of
 the
 most
 important


query
 in
 an
 organization
 right
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day
 the
 organization
 needs
 to


understand
 what
 work
 got
 done
 h
 and


what's
 the
 provenence
 of
 that
 work
 uh


and
 how
 do
 you
 trace
 it
 back
 right
 so


therefore
 you
 kind
 of
 want
 either
 what


if
 it's
 a
 human
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 agents


then
 it's
 really
 macro
 delegation
 micro


steering
 by
 the
 human
 whose
 identity
 was


passed
 on.
 So
 it's
 delegation
 versus
 a


separate
 identity.


>> And
 that
 was
 done
 by
 a
 level
 of


management,
 product
 management
 that


you've
 eliminated,
 that
 Alphabets


eliminated.
 Meta
 has
 started
 to


eliminate
 in
 their
 organization
 four


years
 ago.
 You
 had
 the
 same
 number
 of


employees
 you
 have
 at
 Microsoft
 now,
 but


you
 put
 a
 $90
 billion
 onto
 the
 top
 line


of
 the
 revenue
 in
 that
 time
 and
 you


doubled
 your
 income
 during
 that
 time.
 So


how
 did
 that
 happen?
 Is
 that
 automation


of
 those
 jobs?
 Is
 it
 you
 were
 a
 little


bit
 overstaffed?


>> Unpack.


>> I
 think
 it's
 it's
 actually
 you're


pulling
 on
 a
 very
 interesting
 thread


which
 is
 at
 some
 level
 what's
 the
 big


structural
 change
 that
 needs
 to
 happen.


In
 fact,
 I
 would
 say
 this
 is
 probably


the
 biggest
 change
 in
 knowledge
 work


since
 PCs.
 I
 mean
 I
 always
 you
 know


think
 about
 like
 how
 did
 work
 happen


precise
 right?
 I
 mean
 think
 about
 a


multinational
 company
 like
 ours
 trying


to
 do
 a
 forecast.
 uh
 right
 faxes
 went


around,
 inter
 office
 memos
 got
 sent
 and


then
 you
 kind
 of
 created
 a
 you
 know
 uh
 a


forecast
 then
 suddenly
 you
 know
 PCs


became
 standard
 issue
 uh
 you
 put
 an


Excel
 spreadsheet
 put
 some
 numbers
 sent


it
 in
 email
 everybody
 entered
 numbers


and
 you
 had
 a
 forecast
 so
 the
 work
 the


work
 artifact
 and
 the
 workflow
 all


changed
 that's
 what's
 happening
 so
 for


example
 I'll
 give
 you
 uh
 at
 LinkedIn


uh
 we
 used
 to
 have
 product
 managers
 we


had
 designers
 uh
 we
 had
 front-end


engineers
 and
 then
 we
 had
 CIS
 backend


engineers
 and
 so
 on.
 So
 what
 we
 did
 is


we
 sort
 of
 took
 those
 first
 four
 roles


and
 combined
 them
 in
 fact
 increased


scope
 and
 said
 let's
 they're
 all
 full


stack
 builders.
 So
 I
 like
 that
 because


that's
 a
 structural
 change
 that
 allows


for
 us
 to
 increase
 the
 change
 both
 the


work
 and
 the
 workflow
 between
 these


functions
 and
 I
 would
 assume
 the


velocity
 because
 you
 don't
 have
 four


people
 communicating
 and
 that
 throughput


of
 ideas
 it's
 just
 one
 person
 and
 vibe


coding.
 Exactly.
 And
 there's
 a
 new


workflow.
 So
 what
 at
 the
 same
 time
 as


you
 can
 imagine
 if
 to
 build
 an
 AI


product
 today
 there's
 a
 complete
 new


workflow
 right
 it
 starts
 with
 eval
 right


so
 basically
 there's
 this
 eval
 to


science
 to
 infrastructure
 and
 so
 eval


are
 done
 by
 these
 full
 stack
 builders


and
 what
 have
 you
 and
 product
 managers


in
 the
 new
 form
 the
 infrastructure
 is


built
 by
 the
 systems
 engineers
 at
 the


back
 end
 because
 they
 support
 the


science
 that
 supports
 the
 product.
 So
 in


some
 sense
 there's
 a
 new
 loop
 uh
 and
 you


have
 to
 structurally
 change
 and
 so
 a
 lot


of
 what
 is
 happening
 inside
 a
 tech
 is


that
 change
 uh
 which
 is
 I
 think
 going
 to


be
 pretty
 massive
 uh
 and
 at
 the
 same


time
 a
 company
 like
 ours
 I
 have
 to
 do


everything.
 It's
 not
 like
 I
 can
 just
 so


go
 live
 in
 the
 future.
 I
 have
 to
 make


sure
 we're
 doing
 a
 fantastic
 job
 of


doing
 hot
 patching
 on
 Windows
 is
 done


with
 quality
 uh
 while
 at
 the
 same
 time


building
 the
 evals
 that
 are
 improving


co-pilot
 quality.
 Right?
 And
 so
 both
 of


those
 have
 to
 be
 first
 class.


>> I
 assume
 this
 is
 the
 most
 challenging


moment
 of
 your
 career
 because
 Microsoft


was
 so
 dominant
 duopoly
 in
 some
 spaces.


Um
 but
 you
 really
 weren't
 up
 against
 the


competition
 level
 you're
 up
 against
 now.


I
 was
 talking
 to
 Elon,
 you
 know,
 and
 he


was
 sort
 of
 saying,
 well,
 building
 cars


was
 pretty
 easy.
 Uh
 because
 I
 was
 up


against
 the
 legacy
 car
 makers
 and
 now


I'm
 up
 against


just
 look
 at
 the
 set
 you're
 up
 against.


Yeah,
 it's
 it's
 a
 pretty
 intense
 time.
 I


mean,
 so
 the
 way
 I
 I
 I
 always
 think
 is


it's
 always
 helpful
 uh
 when
 you
 have
 a


complete
 new
 set
 of
 competitors
 every


decade
 because
 that
 keeps
 you
 fit.
 Uh
 if


you
 think
 about
 it,
 I
 joined
 uh


Microsoft
 in
 '92
 when
 I
 had
 Noel
 as
 the


big
 existential
 competitor
 we
 had.
 Um


and
 here
 we
 are
 in
 2026.
 Uh
 and
 it


you're
 absolutely
 right,
 it's
 a
 pretty


intense
 time.
 I'm
 glad
 there's
 the


competition.
 uh
 it's
 it's
 quite
 honestly


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 when
 I
 look
 at
 it


right
 as
 a
 percentage
 of
 GDP
 5
 years


from
 now
 where
 will
 tech
 be
 right
 uh
 it


will
 be
 higher
 so
 we're
 blessed
 to
 be
 in


this
 industry
 it's
 lot
 of
 intense


competition
 but
 it's
 not
 so
 zero
 sum
 as


some
 people
 make
 it
 out


>> it's
 getting
 much
 bigger


>> much
 the
 TAM
 and
 the
 you
 know
 just
 the


impact
 of
 this
 tech
 is
 going
 to
 be
 so


massive
 um
 the
 question
 then
 of
 course


is
 what
 is
 like
 I
 I
 always
 go
 back
 to


what's
 the
 brand
 identity
 Microsoft
 has


brand
 permission.
 We
 have
 what
 do


customers
 expect
 from
 us.
 It's
 sometimes


we
 kind
 of
 overthink
 somehow
 that
 every


customer
 wants
 the
 same
 thing
 from
 all


of
 the
 competitors
 and
 finding
 that
 out,


right?
 It's
 kind
 of
 a
 different
 take
 on


the
 Peter
 Theal
 thing
 which
 is
 you
 got


to
 avoid
 competition
 by
 really


understanding
 what
 customers
 really
 want


from
 you
 uh
 versus
 thinking
 everybody's


a
 competitor.


>> David.


>> Yeah.
 So
 there
 are a
 lot
 of
 heads
 of


state
 here
 obviously
 at
 Davos
 as
 well
 as


CEOs
 of
 Fortune
 500
 companies
 and
 I


think
 you
 got
 asked
 a
 question
 last


night
 at
 the
 dinner
 about
 how
 they


should
 think
 about
 AI
 and
 how
 to
 be


successful
 and
 I
 recall
 they
 used
 the


word
 diffusion
 and
 I
 was
 wondering
 if


you
 could
 expand
 on
 those
 remarks


because
 that
 really
 resonated
 with
 some


of
 the
 policy
 work
 I've
 been
 doing.


>> No,
 absolutely.
 In
 fact,
 uh
 what
 you
 all


have
 been
 doing
 to
 make
 sure
 in
 in
 this


context
 of
 the
 American
 tech
 stack
 um
 is


broadly
 used
 around
 the
 world
 and
 is


trusted
 around
 the
 world
 because
 I
 think


uh
 when
 I
 look
 back
 David
 to
 me
 um
 uh
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 you
 create
 the


technology
 but
 really
 the
 benefits


come
 only
 by
 intense
 use.
 In
 fact,
 one


of
 my
 favorite
 studies
 has
 always
 been


this
 work
 that
 uh
 an
 economist
 I
 think


out
 of
 Dartmouth
 did
 uh
 his
 name
 is


Diego
 Comman
 where
 he
 studied
 uh


basically
 what
 happened
 during
 the


industrial
 revolution
 um
 how
 did


countries
 get
 ahead?
 Um
 and
 the
 simple


sort
 of
 takeaway
 from
 that
 was
 any


country
 uh
 that
 brought
 the
 latest


technology
 into
 their
 uh
 country
 and


then
 did
 value
 add
 technology
 on
 top
 of


it.
 Right?
 So
 it's
 like
 don't
 reinvent


the
 wheel.
 Bring
 the
 latest
 and
 then


build
 on
 top
 of
 it.
 That's
 to
 me
 uh
 what


happens
 you
 know
 when
 you
 have


diffusion.
 So
 especially
 with
 general


purpose
 technologies
 like
 AI
 it
 needs
 to


spread
 like
 right
 in
 our
 you
 know
 in
 our


own
 country
 in
 the
 United
 States
 we
 now


need
 we
 have
 the
 tech.
 The
 question
 is


is
 it
 being
 used
 in
 healthcare?
 Is
 it


being
 used
 um
 in
 financial
 services?
 Is


it
 being
 used
 in
 every
 sector
 of
 the


economy
 by
 large
 businesses,
 small


business,
 public
 sector?
 Um
 so
 to
 me
 un


unless
 and
 until
 we
 see
 that
 diffusion


and
 intense
 use
 uh
 we're
 not
 going
 to


have
 the
 success.
 Um
 uh
 and
 so
 that's


the
 phase
 we
 are
 in
 it's
 f
 you
 know
 it's


diffusing
 faster
 um
 and
 so
 some
 of
 the


work
 policy
 work
 you
 have
 done
 um
 and
 in


general
 all
 you
 know
 the
 good
 news
 here


is
 the
 technologies
 there
 the
 rails


around
 cloud
 and
 mobile
 that
 were
 laid


out
 make
 it
 possible
 for
 this
 thing
 to


spread
 right
 it's
 not
 you
 know


impossible
 to
 get
 the
 tokens
 the


question
 is
 what
 are
 the
 use
 cases
 how


do
 and
 how
 do
 you
 manage
 the
 change
 in


all
 of
 that
 um
 you
 know
 like
 one
 of
 the


questions
 at
 least
 in
 Davos
 is
 it's
 one


for
 the
 west
 and
 the
 developed
 nations.


What
 about
 the
 global
 south?
 Um
 I
 think


global
 south
 has
 a
 huge
 opportunity
 too


quite
 frankly
 because
 to
 me
 like
 let's


say
 you
 know
 40%
 50%
 of
 the
 GDP
 of
 most


global
 south
 countries
 is
 public
 sector.


So
 just
 imagine
 this
 tech
 making
 a


difference
 in
 how
 the
 governments
 uh


really
 parlay
 their
 taxpayer
 money
 into


services
 for
 citizens
 and
 there's
 if


there's
 efficiency
 gains
 that's
 probably


couple
 of
 points
 of
 GDP
 growth
 right


there
 and
 so
 I'm
 very
 optimistic
 that


there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 pull
 uh
 and
 that


we
 should
 as
 the
 United
 States
 given
 the


technology
 stack
 we
 have
 uh
 in
 Europe
 in


Asia
 in
 you
 know
 in
 South
 America
 in


Africa
 and
 everywhere


get
 it
 to
 be
 broadly
 deployed.


>> You
 one
 of
 the
 questions
 I
 get
 asked
 a


lot
 about
 the
 AI
 race
 is
 how
 do
 you
 know


if
 you're
 winning
 or
 how
 do
 you
 know
 if


the
 United
 States
 is
 ahead
 of
 its
 global


competitors?
 And
 the
 answer
 I
 give
 is


market
 share.
 You
 know,
 if
 we
 look


around
 the
 world
 in
 5
 years
 and
 we
 see


that
 American
 companies,
 American


technology
 has
 say
 80%
 market
 share,
 it


means
 we
 did
 a
 good
 job.
 If
 we
 look


around
 the
 world
 in
 five
 years
 and
 see


that
 it's
 say
 Chinese
 chips
 and
 Chinese


models
 that
 are
 being
 used
 all
 over
 the


world,
 well
 means
 we
 probably
 lost.
 So


you
 know
 ultimately
 usage
 is
 the
 proof


of
 the
 pudding
 is
 in
 the
 eating
 of
 it.
 I


mean
 the
 in
 this
 case
 the
 way
 that
 you


know
 that
 you're
 succeeding
 is
 through


market
 shares
 through
 usage.


>> I
 and
 I
 I
 would
 agree
 with
 that.
 But


David,
 since
 you
 even
 worked
 at


Microsoft
 for
 a
 few
 years,
 um
 you
 you


know,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I'm
 very


grounded
 on
 is
 always
 uh
 that
 Bill
 Gates


line
 of
 a
 platform,
 right?
 So,
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 I
 always
 think
 about
 is


it's
 market
 share,
 but
 it's
 also


ecosystem
 effects,
 right?
 See,
 what
 the


United
 States
 always
 has
 done
 is
 not


just
 about
 our
 market
 share
 or
 even
 um


the
 revenues
 to
 US
 companies.
 In
 fact,


one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 learned
 at
 Microsoft


is
 whenever
 I
 did
 a
 country
 visit,
 the


data
 I
 would
 first
 study
 is
 in
 let's
 say


in
 the
 UK
 or
 in
 Switzerland
 or
 what
 have


you
 is
 what
 is
 the
 total
 employment


created
 in
 Switzerland
 uh
 in
 our
 channel


that
 used
 to
 be
 like
 the
 number
 one


thing
 uh
 in
 our
 country
 reports
 right


and
 the
 total
 number


>> that
 be
 like
 the
 number
 of
 IT
 workers


the
 number


>> office
 workers
 channel
 so
 channel


partners
 we
 so
 number
 of
 ISVs


uh
 who
 were
 there.
 So
 we
 used
 to
 have
 a


complete
 marker
 of
 how
 did
 the
 ecosystem


around
 the
 platform
 get
 built
 one


country
 at
 a
 time
 and
 that
 is
 what
 the


United
 States
 has
 always
 done.
 In
 fact


the
 US
 tech
 stack


>> including
 in
 China
 got
 built
 because


others
 built
 around
 our
 tech
 stack
 the


same
 thing
 is
 going
 to
 happen.
 So
 that's


why
 I
 think
 the
 work
 you're
 doing
 around


diffusion,


>> right,


>> is
 about
 really
 increasing
 the
 size
 of


the
 pie,
 the
 trust
 in
 the
 platform
 so


that
 there
 is
 true
 economic
 opportunity


quite
 frankly.


>> Well,
 you're
 right
 and
 and
 I
 remember


actually
 you
 you
 brought
 back
 some


memories
 from
 this
 is
 about
 a
 decade
 ago


when
 my
 company
 Yammer
 was
 acquired
 by


Microsoft.
 we
 were
 part
 of
 uh
 the


SharePoint
 group
 and
 I
 remember
 that
 the


um
 the
 product
 managers
 there
 were
 very


proud
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 revenue
 from


the
 SharePoint
 ecosystem
 meaning


non-Microsoft


the
 um
 the
 consulting
 community
 the


implementers
 who
 would
 go
 into
 companies


implement
 SharePoint
 I
 think
 their


revenue
 is
 something
 like
 seven
 times


greater
 than
 Microsoft's
 own
 software


revenue
 and
 I
 think


>> in
 aggregate


>> in
 aggregate
 and
 I
 think
 and
 I
 think


Bill
 had
 a
 line
 about
 you're
 not
 an


ecosystem
 or
 platform
 until
 the
 revenue


on
 top
 of
 your
 platform
 is
 some,
 you


know,
 factor
 of
 your
 own
 revenue.
 And


and
 I
 and
 I
 think
 that
 I
 think
 what's


really
 important
 about
 this
 is
 when
 we


talk
 about
 diffusion
 and
 obviously
 want


the
 United
 States
 to
 have
 this
 leading


position,
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 it's
 bad
 for


the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 because
 they're


able
 to
 build
 on
 top
 of
 those
 platforms


and
 create
 even
 more
 value.


>> 100%.
 In
 fact,
 that's
 sort
 of
 the
 most


important
 point,
 right?
 So
 this
 is
 not


that
 this
 is
 not
 about
 uh
 American
 tech


um
 and
 America
 revenues
 to
 the
 United


States.
 It's
 actually
 creating


opportunity
 using
 a
 new
 platform


everywhere.
 And
 in
 fact
 you
 know
 the
 you


know
 like
 I
 remember
 I
 worked
 on
 our


database
 products
 uh
 in
 the
 '90s
 u
 you


know
 with
 SAP
 in
 fact
 the
 combination
 of


uh
 SQL
 Server
 and
 R3
 were
 successful
 on


both
 sides.
 There's
 a
 lot
 talked
 about


Intel
 and
 Microsoft,
 but
 one
 of the


other
 things
 that
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 which
 has


sort
 of
 been
 foundational
 in
 how
 I
 look


at
 the
 world
 is
 what
 we
 did
 with
 a


European
 software
 company
 that
 is
 still


uh
 you
 know
 a
 giant.
 And
 so
 that
 you


know
 who
 knows
 what
 the
 next
 big
 AI
 app


will
 be
 and
 where
 and
 what
 will
 happen.


But
 uh
 I
 I
 sort
 of
 go
 in
 with
 the


attitude
 that
 there
 will
 be
 tech


companies
 uh
 maybe
 even
 top
 five
 tech


companies
 that
 could
 emerge
 everywhere


with
 even
 the
 American
 tech
 stack.
 you


have
 um
 done
 some
 amazing
 acquisitions


and
 you're
 quite
 a
 dealmaker
 on
 top
 of


being
 a
 technologist.
 It's
 probably
 the


least
 reported
 aspect
 of
 your


spectacular
 tenure
 and
 the
 massive


growth
 you've
 had.


But
 you
 did
 a
 deal
 with
 OpenAI
 and


probably
 one
 of
 the
 most
 savvy


slashcontroversial
 dealmakers
 of
 all


time,
 Sam
 Alman.
 That
 deal
 was
 looked
 at


as


you
 you
 you're you're
 set
 up
 to
 get
 a


windfall
 in
 cash
 which
 you
 don't
 need
 as


Microsoft.
 always
 nice
 I'm
 guessing
 if


they
 IPO
 but
 did
 you
 create
 potentially


and
 this
 was
 the
 criticism
 of
 it


an
 ultimate
 competitor
 to
 Microsoft
 and


how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 that
 and
 how
 can


Microsoft
 which
 missed
 Steve
 Bombber's


biggest
 regret
 missing
 the
 mobile


revolution
 how
 can
 you
 not
 have
 a
 Gemini


an
 XAI
 a
 claude
 that
 is
 your
 own
 or
 in


your
 mind
 do
 you
 have
 that
 because
 you


have
 the
 source
 code
 of
 open
 AI


>> yeah
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 right
 so
 when


when
 people
 say
 uh
 where
 is
 your


foundation
 model?
 I
 mean
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 we
 do
 have
 the
 IP
 but
 that
 said


I
 think
 you
 bring
 up
 a
 couple
 different


things
 right
 one
 is
 to
 us
 the
 most


important
 thing
 when
 I
 look
 at
 what
 is


Microsoft's
 uh
 strategy
 today
 one
 is
 we


want
 to
 build
 token
 factories
 right
 so


our
 biggest
 business
 today
 is
 Azure


business
 and
 the
 Azure
 business
 the
 TAM


given
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 is
 is
 so


huge
 that
 we
 now
 need
 to
 be
 fantastic
 uh


at
 building
 these
 token
 factories
 and
 um


that's
 means
 a
 heterogeneous
 fleet
 of


infrastructure


and
 that
 every
 hyperscaler
 has
 always


done
 which
 is
 use
 software
 to
 make


maximum
 use
 of
 it
 and
 for
 TCO
 and


utilization.
 So
 that's
 one
 side
 of
 it.


Then
 there's
 the
 app
 server
 business


right
 which
 is
 everybody
 we
 you
 talked


about
 like
 if
 everyone's
 going
 to
 be


building
 agents
 have
 infinite
 minds
 have


these
 RL
 gyms
 have
 eval
 what
 have
 you


there's
 an
 entire
 just
 like
 every


platform
 has
 had
 an
 app
 server
 this
 one


has
 an
 app
 server
 that's
 what
 we're


doing
 with
 foundry
 and
 what
 have
 you


right
 so
 there's
 an
 app
 server
 business


in
 that
 app
 server
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 structurally
 now
 is
 pretty
 clear
 is


anyone
 building
 any
 application
 or
 any


company
 is
 going
 to
 use
 not
 one
 model


but
 all
 the
 models
 Right?
 Why
 would
 I


not?
 Right?
 Which
 is
 in
 fact
 I
 will


orchestrate
 for
 any
 given
 task
 even


multiple
 models.
 Right?
 There's
 this
 one


nice
 thing
 that
 we
 came
 out
 in
 our


healthcare
 practice
 called
 the
 decision


orchestrator.
 What
 it
 proves
 is
 that
 by


assigning
 roles,
 right?
 So
 investigator,


data
 analyst,
 domain
 expert,
 just
 giving


even
 prompted
 roles
 to
 models
 and
 then


orchestrating
 them
 gets
 better
 results


than
 any
 one
 single
 frontier
 model.
 Am
 I


right
 to
 read
 into
 that
 then
 that
 you're


bullish
 on
 the
 open-
 source
 models
 and


think
 large
 language
 models
 will
 largely


be
 commoditized
 and
 that's
 not
 where
 the


value
 will
 occur.
 In
 fact,
 the
 way
 I


think
 about
 it
 is
 that
 just
 like
 what


happened


>> and
 Apple
 thinks
 that
 too
 by
 the
 way.


>> By
 the
 way,
 what
 the
 way
 you
 think
 about


what
 happened
 in
 the
 database
 market,


right?
 You
 know,
 I
 used
 to
 be
 like


everything
 is
 just
 a
 SQL
 database
 until


it
 was
 not,
 right?
 There
 was
 I
 mean,


think
 about
 it.
 There
 dock
 databases,


there
 is
 no
 SQL
 databases.
 The


proliferation
 of
 databases,
 right?
 Who


would
 have
 thought
 that
 the
 database


market
 would
 have
 such
 a
 richness
 to
 it


>> or
 that
 it
 could
 ever
 be
 open
 source?


That
 was


>> that's
 true.
 I
 mean
 talk
 about
 Postgress


or
 what
 has
 happened
 even
 with


which
 is
 open
 but
 there
 are
 even


companies
 that
 have
 backed
 it
 and
 so
 so


to
 me
 that's
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 and


to
 me
 a
 model
 is
 like
 the
 database


market
 you
 know
 it's
 it's
 got
 it's
 going


to
 differences
 but
 I
 sort
 of
 somehow


think
 that
 uh
 it's
 not
 there
 are


definitely
 going
 to
 be
 frontier
 models


that
 are
 closed
 source
 you
 know
 there


going
 to
 be
 open
 source
 models
 that
 are


going
 to
 be
 uh
 uh
 frontier
 class
 in
 fact


if
 anything
 I
 think
 in
 this
 next
 year


what'll
 be
 probably
 a
 big
 part
 of
 the


discussion
 is
 what's
 the
 future
 of
 a


firm?
 A
 firm
 should
 be
 able
 to
 take
 the


tacet
 knowledge
 it
 has
 and
 embed
 it


inside
 a
 weights
 in
 a
 model
 that
 they


control.
 Right?
 So
 when
 somebody
 asks
 me


how
 many
 models
 should
 be
 there,
 I'll


say
 as
 many
 models
 as
 firms
 in
 the


world.
 Right?
 That's
 sort
 of
 the
 an


extreme
 way.
 Uh
 because
 because
 to
 me


that's
 how
 I
 think
 this
 you
 know
 this


knowledge
 economy
 becomes
 an
 AI
 economy.


>> Are
 you


secretly
 and
 you
 can
 say
 it
 here
 since


we're
 on
 allin
 working
 on
 an
 LLM
 to


exist
 on
 the
 Windows
 desktop
 because


that
 you
 are
 you
 have
 it
 like
 today


there's
 a
 five
 silica
 model
 which
 is


completely
 resident
 using
 NPUs
 and
 of


course
 using
 uh
 GPUs
 in
 fact
 the
 largest


installation


um
 of
 high
 power
 in
 fact
 it's
 one
 of
 the


fascinating
 the
 workstation
 is
 back
 I'm


one
 of
 the
 most
 if
 you
 went
 to
 see


>> which
 is
 great
 for
 Microsoft
 because
 you


you
 have
 a
 nice
 desktop
 business.


>> Absolutely.
 And
 so
 we
 and
 in
 fact
 we


think
 that
 that
 form
 factor
 especially
 I


mean
 I
 I
 always
 say
 this
 which
 is
 u
 you


know
 I
 started
 my
 career
 on
 a
 command


line.
 Who
 knows
 I
 may
 just
 end
 it
 in
 a


command
 line.


>> Well
 you
 started
 at
 Sun
 which
 was
 the


original
 5
 $10,000
 workstation.
 Do
 you


see
 a
 time
 where
 you'll
 be
 meeting
 with


your
 customers
 here
 and
 advocating
 a
 10


$20,000
 desktop
 machine
 that
 has
 an
 LLM


and
 the
 hardware?
 You
 can
 you
 can
 put
 a


DGX
 card
 and
 you
 can
 have
 like
 just
 a


fantastic
 machine
 and
 the
 models
 I
 and


by
 the
 way
 you
 know
 we
 are
 one


architecture
 tweak
 away
 from
 even
 having


some
 kind
 of
 a
 distributed
 model


architecture
 right
 even
 ane
 architecture


that
 shows
 knows
 how
 to
 really


distribute
 itself
 right
 that's
 the
 type


of
 breakthrough
 that
 can
 completely


change
 uh
 what
 hybrid
 AI
 may
 look
 like


but
 we're
 absolutely
 committed
 and


focused
 on
 making
 the
 PC
 a
 great
 place


for
 local
 models
 uh
 and
 local
 models


that
 then
 do
 even
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 prompt


processing
 and
 call
 into
 the
 cloud,


right?
 So
 there's
 a
 whole
 lot
 of
 work


that
 can
 happen
 and
 that's
 sort
 of


definitely
 something
 that's
 underway.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that
 the
 cloud
 co-work
 has


kind
 of
 shown
 the
 power
 of
 tapping
 into


the
 local
 file
 drive
 and
 be
 able
 to
 use


that.
 That
 that
 brings
 up
 another
 point.


you
 you
 got
 me
 thinking
 about
 Yammer
 and


for
 people
 who
 don't
 know
 um
 you
 know


Yammer's
 claim
 to
 fame
 this
 is
 about
 15


years
 ago
 was
 that
 it
 pioneered
 a
 lot
 of


um
 well
 it
 used
 a
 lot
 of
 consumer
 growth


tactics
 to
 attack
 enterprise
 software


I'm
 wondering
 as
 you
 think
 about


enterprise
 adoption
 of
 AI
 how
 do
 you


think
 it's
 going
 to
 spread
 over
 the
 next


year
 it
 feels
 like
 we're
 at
 sort
 of
 a
 a


a
 critical
 point
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 going


to
 be
 top
 down
 is
 it
 going
 to
 come
 from


the
 CEO
 directing
 a
 team
 giving
 them
 a


strategic
 transformation


project
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 do
 an
 RFP


or
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 spread


bottom
 up
 in
 the
 enterprise
 through
 AI


native
 employees
 who
 are
 adaptable
 who


are
 using
 the
 tools
 in
 their
 own
 lives


and
 they
 start
 to
 bring
 these
 things
 to


work
 and
 start
 accomplishing
 amazing


things.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 I
 think
 you
 know
 like
 all


things
 David
 I
 think
 it's
 both
 the
 top


down
 bottom
 up
 right.
 uh
 the
 that
 the


reason
 I
 say
 that
 top
 down
 is
 if
 I
 look


at
 the
 ROI
 uh
 of
 uh
 applying
 AI
 in


customer
 service
 uh
 or
 in
 supply
 chain


or
 in
 HR
 self-service
 those
 are
 the
 easy


projects
 where
 uh
 IT
 and
 CXOs
 can
 make


calls
 and
 that's
 where
 you'll
 see
 the


first
 drop
 of
 uh
 real
 AI
 adoption
 but


the
 bottom
 up
 is
 what
 ultimately
 will


happen
 right
 I
 mean
 with
 even
 with
 the


PCs
 in
 fact
 if
 you
 think
 back
 at
 the


lawyers
 brought
 word
 in
 and
 then
 finance


bought
 Excel
 in
 and
 then
 email
 came
 and


then
 it
 became
 standard
 issue.
 That's


what's
 happening
 right
 now.
 So
 for


example,
 these
 agents
 when
 I
 sort
 of


talk
 about
 everybody's
 building
 agents,


they
 are
 figuring
 out
 a
 way
 to
 go
 create


these
 things
 that
 are
 changing
 workflow


and
 removing
 drudgery
 in
 their
 work.


Right?
 That's
 sort
 of
 the
 beginning
 of


what
 is
 a
 bottomup
 transformation.
 Um
 I


you
 I
 was
 in
 fact
 the
 thing
 that
 I'm


most
 excited
 about
 is
 this
 bottomup


change
 even
 at
 Microsoft
 for
 example
 we


manage
 something
 like
 500
 odd
 fiber


operators
 around
 the
 world
 in
 in
 Azure


today
 and
 by
 the
 way
 I
 not
 myself


realized
 it
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 you
 know
 it's


called
 DevOps
 but
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 physical


asset
 things
 get
 cut
 and
 when
 you
 sort


of
 say
 DevOps
 that
 means
 you
 literally


are
 emailing
 people
 and
 saying
 hey
 what


happened
 to
 that
 fiber
 cut
 how
 do
 we


repair
 it
 so
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 back
 and


forth
 so
 this
 network
 the
 the
 person
 who


runs
 our
 global
 network
 basically
 has


built
 to
 your
 point
 about
 these
 person


they're
 just
 digital
 employees


essentially
 that
 are
 doing
 all
 of
 that


devops
 uh
 and
 so
 that's
 and
 there's
 a


completely
 bottoms
 up
 uh
 where
 you
 see


the
 tools
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 hey
 I
 have


the
 new
 way
 to
 build
 agents
 it's
 there


I'm
 going
 to
 use
 it
 to
 create
 levels
 of


automation
 uh
 that
 remove
 drudgery


improve
 efficiency
 improve
 quality
 and


that
 ultimately
 is
 a
 skilling
 thing


which
 is
 sort
 of
 the
 big
 issue
 which
 is


um
 and
 skilling
 is
 not
 mystical
 it's


just
 by
 doing
 right
 so
 it's
 not
 like
 I


go
 to
 a
 class
 per
 se
 it's
 like
 the


diffusion
 of
 the
 tools
 uh
 and
 using
 the


tools
 and
 that
 I
 think
 is
 what's
 really


going
 to
 be
 happening


>> and
 and
 we're
 in
 a
 very
 interesting


moment
 empowering
 an
 existing
 employee


with
 these
 tools
 is
 so
 much
 easier
 than


hiring
 and
 mentoring
 and
 bringing
 up
 the


next
 generation
 so
 it
 feels
 like
 we're


in
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an
 indigestion
 moment


at
 Microsoft,
 do
 you
 think
 who's
 going


to
 have
 my
 job


>> in
 30
 or
 40
 years,
 if
 the
 company
 stays


the
 same
 size?
 Because
 given
 your


technology
 first
 approach,
 there's


really
 no
 reason
 to
 ever
 add
 another


Microsoft
 employee
 at
 the
 pace
 this
 is


going
 and
 you
 haven't
 for
 four
 years.


So,
 how
 you
 may
 have
 swapped
 some
 in
 and


out
 and
 changed
 the
 texture
 of
 it.
 So,


how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 maybe
 this
 next


generation?
 What
 advice
 would
 you
 have


for
 these
 college
 graduates
 who
 maybe


don't
 have
 an
 offer
 for
 Microsoft
 right


now?
 And
 you
 used
 to
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time


on
 that
 building
 that
 group,
 but
 maybe


you
 don't
 have
 that
 luxury
 now.
 Do
 you


think
 about
 it
 ever?


>> No,
 I
 I
 mean
 it's
 a
 great
 question.
 I


you
 know
 there's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


debate
 what
 happens
 to
 early
 in
 career


and
 how
 is
 college
 recruiting.
 I
 still


am
 a
 big
 believer
 in
 uh
 college


recruiting
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


um
 this
 is
 going
 to
 change
 the
 curve
 by


which
 anyone
 can
 pick
 up
 proficiency
 in


a
 codebase.
 Let's
 just
 it
 takes
 sort
 of


just
 regular
 CS
 hiring.
 uh
 what
 has


changed
 is
 perhaps
 for
 someone
 who
 comes


in
 new
 into
 a
 team
 and
 to
 be
 able
 to


ramp
 up
 thanks
 to
 all
 of
 uh
 the


markdowns,
 the
 skills,
 uh
 the
 fact
 that


I
 can
 go
 ask
 the
 agent.
 I
 mean,
 think


about
 it,
 right?
 It's
 like
 having
 an


unbelievable
 mentor
 who
 is
 getting
 you


onboarded
 onto
 a
 codebase
 faster.
 So
 in


some
 sense
 the
 productivity
 curve
 uh
 of


a
 college
 hire
 is
 going
 to
 be
 much


steeper
 than
 it
 ever
 before.
 So
 I
 think


there
 might
 be
 a
 difference.
 In
 fact,


one
 of
 the
 things
 we're
 experimenting


with
 is
 a
 different
 type
 of


apprenticeship,
 right?
 Which
 is
 you
 take


somebody
 who's
 an
 IC
 senior
 dev
 have


like
 a
 cohort
 of
 college
 uh
 hires


working
 with
 them
 because
 it's
 a
 new
 way


of
 working.
 It's
 like
 I
 remember
 like


all
 you
 know
 everybody
 who
 joined


Microsoft
 would
 say
 go
 how
 how
 did
 you


know
 whatever
 um
 Cutler
 implement
 Malik


or
 what
 have
 you
 right
 he
 would
 go
 try


to
 read
 uh
 his
 code
 to
 understand
 uh


what
 great
 craftsmanship
 looks
 like


nowadays
 I
 think
 that
 great


craftsmanship
 uh
 comes
 by
 looking
 at


even
 how
 the
 10x
 100x
 engineers
 use
 AI


to
 build
 great
 quality
 products
 uh
 and


that
 is
 what
 these
 new
 college
 grads


will
 learn
 and
 learn
 faster
 and
 so


that's
 a
 beneficial
 thing
 for
 a
 company


like
 us
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


you
 know
 until
 we
 saw
 longevity
 or


something
 we
 need
 people
 to
 come
 into


the
 workforce
 be
 successful
 at
 Microsoft


so
 we
 are
 very
 committed
 but
 we
 are
 also


making
 sure
 that
 the
 scopes
 of
 the
 jobs


make
 sense
 for
 what
 the
 aspirations
 of


people
 are
 going
 to
 be
 both
 who
 are


currently
 in
 the
 workforce
 and
 people


who
 are
 entering
 the
 workforce.


Okay,
 on
 that
 note,
 Sache
 Nadella,


>> thank
 you
 so
 much.
