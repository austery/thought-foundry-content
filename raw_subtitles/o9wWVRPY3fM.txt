I'm
 Rosie
 Garren
 and
 you're
 listening
 to


the
 Wire
 Cutter
 Show.


Hey
 there,
 it's
 Rosie.
 In
 our
 last


episode,
 Christine
 and
 I
 talked
 with


Wire
 Cutter
 editorial
 director
 Margarite


Preston
 about
 the
 gear
 you
 need
 to


upgrade
 your
 coffee
 setup
 at
 home.
 We


covered
 grinders,
 different
 brewing


methods,
 and
 other
 techniques
 to
 develop


the
 flavor
 you
 want
 in
 your
 morning


brew.
 So,
 go
 check
 that
 out
 if
 you


haven't
 heard
 it.
 But
 there
 was
 one


important
 element
 of
 a
 great
 cup
 of


coffee
 we
 didn't
 have
 time
 to
 talk


about,
 and
 that's
 the
 coffee
 beans


themselves.


Every
 cup
 of
 coffee
 starts
 off
 as
 a
 ripe


coffee
 cherry,
 the
 fruit
 of
 the
 coffee


plant.
 The
 seeds
 of
 that
 plant
 get


harvested,
 dried,
 roasted,
 and
 packaged


up
 as
 coffee
 beans.
 Every
 step
 of
 the


coffee
 production
 process
 is
 an


opportunity
 to
 change
 the
 way
 a
 cup


eventually
 will
 taste.
 From
 the
 type
 of


coffee
 plant
 you
 grow
 to
 the
 temperature


at
 which
 you
 roast
 the
 beans.
 To
 be


honest,
 I
 find
 that
 a
 bit
 overwhelming.


I've
 been
 a
 wannabe
 coffee
 snob
 for


years
 and
 I
 still
 struggle
 at
 the


grocery
 store
 or
 at
 my
 local
 coffee
 shop


deciphering
 the
 words
 on
 the
 back
 of
 a


bag
 of
 beans.
 How
 do
 I
 experiment
 with


new
 brands
 or
 new
 coffee
 roasters
 and


still
 have
 confidence
 that
 I'm
 actually


going
 to
 like
 the
 taste?
 So
 to


understand
 that,
 I'm
 going
 through


coffee
 101
 with
 some
 nai.
 Sum
 is


co-founder
 of
 coffee
 project
 New
 York


which
 began
 as
 a
 coffee
 shop
 in
 New


York's
 East
 Village
 and
 it
 has
 since


expanded
 into
 roasting
 wholesale
 retail


education.
 Sum
 also
 happens
 to
 be
 a


certified
 QG
 grader
 which
 I've
 just


learned
 is
 essentially
 the
 equivalent
 of


a
 somalier
 in
 wine.
 So
 after
 the
 break


some's
 going
 to
 tell
 me
 about
 how
 to
 buy


coffee
 beans
 that
 will
 end
 up
 in
 a
 cup


of
 coffee
 I
 love.
 So
 stick
 around.


We're
 back
 with
 S
 Guy,
 coffee
 expert
 and


co-founder
 of
 Coffee
 Project
 New
 York.


Sum,
 welcome
 to
 the
 Wire
 Cutter
 Show.
 So


happy
 to
 have
 you.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 Um,
 my
 first


question
 is
 how,
 why,
 when
 did
 you
 fall


in
 love
 with
 coffee?
 I'm
 from
 Malaysia,


born
 and
 raised,
 and
 coffee
 culture


there,
 it's
 a
 big
 thing.
 Like,
 we
 would


go
 hang
 out,
 drink
 coffee
 at
 any
 time
 of


the
 day,
 7:00
 a.m.
 to
 like
 2:00
 a.m.
 in


the
 morning
 because
 it's
 just
 like
 a


medium
 for
 us
 to
 get
 together
 and
 talk


about
 things.
 My
 love
 for
 actual
 like


the
 specialty
 coffee
 side
 of
 things


didn't
 really
 happen
 until
 I
 moved
 to


New
 York
 City.
 I
 wanted
 to
 actually


build
 the
 space
 like
 what
 I
 have
 back


home
 in
 Malaysia
 for
 people
 to
 come
 in


and
 gather
 drinking
 whatever
 that
 they


want.
 However,
 I
 realized
 that
 as
 soon


as
 I
 start
 the
 business,
 me
 diving


deeper
 and
 deeper
 into
 coffee
 as
 a


beverage.


>> Yeah.
 And
 now
 it
 become
 coffee
 as
 the


fruit
 and
 then
 the
 whole
 coffee
 culture


is
 the
 people
 the
 producer
 and
 all
 these


people
 that
 we're
 bringing
 together


changed
 a
 lot
 for
 me
 from
 the
 beginning


itself
 where
 it
 is
 just
 the
 barriage
 as


a
 medium
 of
 connection.


>> Okay.
 So
 you
 obviously
 have
 a
 very
 very


deep
 knowledge
 of
 coffee.
 We're
 going
 to


ask
 you
 to
 dial
 it
 way
 way way
 back
 like


you're
 talking
 to
 curious
 noviceses.
 So,


how
 do
 you
 choose
 beans
 you
 know
 you'll


like
 when
 you
 get
 home?


>> So,
 I
 think
 the
 first
 thing
 is
 maybe


look
 at
 the
 bag
 of
 coffee
 and
 see
 some


of
 these
 flavor
 calls
 that
 is
 listed
 on


the
 back.
 I
 prefer
 to
 go
 with
 the
 flavor


first
 or
 the
 profile
 first
 because
 then


it
 opens
 up
 your
 mind
 about
 trying


different
 coffees
 from
 different
 origin.


>> I
 want
 to
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 these


tasting
 notes
 and
 some
 of
 the
 words
 that


you
 see
 on
 on
 a
 bag
 of
 coffee.
 If
 you


see
 chocolatey
 as
 a
 as
 an
 example,
 what


does
 that
 mean?


>> A
 lot
 of
 times
 it's
 an
 impression.
 The


bag
 of
 coffee
 tells
 you
 what
 is
 the


first
 thing
 that
 you
 might
 be
 tasting.


Coffee
 itself
 is
 a
 fruit.
 So
 the
 innate


flavor
 call
 that
 you
 get
 from
 it,
 it's


going
 to
 be
 either
 fruity
 or
 something


herbaceious
 or
 floral.


>> Okay?


>> Or
 a
 combination
 of
 both.
 But
 when
 you


see
 a
 bag
 of
 coffee
 that
 you
 have
 notes


like
 chocolate,
 hazelnuts,
 brown
 sugar,


these
 are
 all
 the
 chemical
 reaction


that's
 happening
 when
 we
 put
 the
 seed


into
 a
 roaster
 and
 start
 roasting
 them.


So
 it's
 the
 sugar
 in
 the
 city
 itself


browning
 to
 a
 certain
 reaction.
 It


reminds
 you
 of
 how
 it
 tastes
 like


chocolate.


>> Yeah.


>> Hazelnut
 or
 um
 brown
 sugar.


>> I've
 seen
 cherry.
 I've
 seen
 apple.
 I've


seen
 so
 many
 different
 things
 and
 I've


always
 wondered
 what
 that
 means.
 So
 that


manifests
 when
 the
 beans
 are
 being


roasted.


>> Correct.
 So
 um
 technically
 speaking
 like


whenever
 the
 coffee
 is
 getting
 roasted


chemical
 reaction
 happen
 and
 the
 heat


change
 some
 component
 in
 the
 beans


itself
 to
 a
 compound
 that
 you
 might
 also


find
 in
 let's
 say
 strawberry.
 So
 when
 we


both
 eat
 a
 strawberry
 together,
 we
 know


it
 tastes
 like
 strawberry,
 right?


>> But
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 your
 strawberry


tastes
 and
 you
 will
 not
 know
 how
 my


strawberry
 tastes,
 but
 we
 both
 know
 that


we're
 tasting
 strawberry
 because
 we
 have


experience
 having
 them.
 with
 the


roasting
 side
 of
 things
 is
 if
 this


coffee
 has
 impression
 of
 strawberry,


highly
 likely
 there
 is
 a
 compound
 in
 the


beverage
 itself
 that
 reminds
 you
 of
 the


strawberry
 that
 you
 had
 in
 the
 other


compound
 when
 you're
 eating
 a


strawberry.
 So,


>> so
 this
 is
 all
 incredibly
 subjective


because
 notes
 of
 strawberry
 to
 me
 in
 a


bag
 of
 coffee
 are
 is
 very
 likely
 going


to
 be
 different
 or
 different
 on
 my


palette
 than
 it
 will
 be
 on
 yours,


whatever
 that
 strawberry
 is.


>> Correct.
 So
 uh
 whenever
 I
 am
 teaching
 a


class
 or
 I'm
 like
 getting
 a
 note
 uh
 on


the
 back
 of
 coffee
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 we
 try


to
 stay
 calibrated.
 We
 will
 know
 like
 if


let's
 say
 this
 bag
 of
 coffee
 tastes
 like


strawberry
 then
 my
 strawberry
 and
 your


strawberry
 will
 somewhat
 be
 the
 same


because
 we
 have
 experience
 with
 what
 we


call
 the
 coffee
 lexicon
 or
 the
 flavor


wheel
 where
 we
 do
 a
 bunch
 of
 pallet


calibration
 together.


>> Can
 you
 explain
 this
 process?
 I've
 I've


heard
 of
 it.
 I've
 read
 a
 little
 bit


about
 it,
 but
 I'm
 I
 would
 love
 for
 you


to
 kind
 of
 paint
 a
 picture
 of
 what
 that


looks
 like.
 The
 calibration
 process.


>> Once
 in
 a
 while,
 we
 gather
 some
 of
 our


team
 members
 and
 we
 buy
 a
 bunch
 of


spices,
 fruits,
 and
 we
 eat
 it
 together


and
 try
 to
 pinpoint
 the
 product
 that


we're
 eating
 from
 ground
 level.
 So,
 take


a
 lime
 and
 as
 an
 example.
 So,
 when
 I


have
 a
 lime,
 I
 cut
 it
 open
 and
 I
 start


eating
 it.
 Instead
 of
 just
 saying
 like
 a


sour,
 we're
 diving
 into
 the
 five
 basic


tastes.
 Sweet,
 sour,
 bitter,
 umami,
 and


salty.
 When
 we
 do
 an
 exercise
 like
 that


together,
 we
 write
 down
 from
 aroma,


fragrance,
 which
 is
 we
 start
 from


smelling
 them.
 And
 I
 remember
 doing
 this


exercise
 and
 realized
 for
 the
 very
 first


time,
 lime
 on
 its
 own
 is
 not
 just
 sharp,


bright,
 and
 acidic.
 It's
 actually
 salty.


>> Huh.
 And
 then
 we
 would
 tone
 down
 our


levels
 to
 match
 each
 other
 and
 at
 the


same
 time
 would
 explain
 why
 I
 would


taste
 this
 this
 way.
 So
 this
 is
 how
 we


stay
 calibrated
 in
 the
 professional


setting.
 However,
 how
 do
 we
 stay


calibrated
 with
 people
 who
 enjoy
 our


coffee
 that
 is
 not
 in
 coffee?
 And
 that's


when
 you
 see
 bags
 of
 coffee
 that
 says


that
 it
 tastes
 like
 Jolly
 Rancher,


tastes
 like
 a
 cotton
 candy.
 So
 these
 are


terms
 that
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 common


that
 people
 can
 actually
 figure
 it
 out


and
 also
 think
 about
 it
 and
 it's
 also


more
 fun
 and
 personally
 I
 think
 it's


less
 scary.
 So
 if
 I
 get
 a
 bag
 of
 coffee


that
 tastes
 like
 Fruity
 Pebbles,
 I'll


know
 for
 sure
 that
 oh
 it's
 a
 mixed
 bag


of
 fruits,
 tastes
 like
 a
 red
 sunre,
 then


I
 know
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit


boozy
 and
 also
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 red


grape
 compared
 to
 like
 if
 you
 want
 to
 go


straight
 into
 like
 this
 coffee
 tastes


like
 orange,
 strawberry
 and
 kiwi.
 I


think
 after
 brewing
 it,
 sipping
 it
 and


looking
 at
 the
 label
 helped
 you


understand
 the
 flavor.


When
 I'm
 buying
 coffee,
 should
 I
 be


buying
 whole
 bean
 or
 ground?


>> I
 think
 whole
 bean
 is
 always
 the
 go-to


because
 once
 you
 ground
 the
 coffee,


you're
 exposing
 the
 coffee
 areas
 a
 lot


more.
 So,
 chances
 of
 it
 degassing,


getting
 still
 is
 a
 lot
 quicker
 even


though
 you
 still
 them.
 But
 that's
 a
 very


practical
 reason
 of
 why
 you
 do
 not
 want


to
 grind
 your
 coffee
 ahead
 of
 time
 is


because
 you
 don't
 know
 how
 you
 want
 to


brew
 it.


>> Mhm.


>> So
 if
 let's
 say
 you
 are
 you
 have
 a
 bag


of
 coffee
 and
 you
 preground
 or
 you


bought
 it
 pregrown,
 there's
 only
 going


to
 be
 good
 for
 like
 filter.
 You
 won't
 be


able
 to
 make
 any
 adjustment
 or
 like


cater
 it
 to
 a
 different
 brew
 style.


>> Another
 term
 I've
 been
 curious
 about


roast
 date.
 M


>> what
 does
 that
 mean
 relative
 to
 my


buying
 and
 then
 making
 and
 drinking
 a


cup
 of
 coffee?


>> So
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 roast
 date
 is
 uh


technically
 when
 is
 the
 beans
 getting


roasted
 and
 finished
 and
 packaging.
 That


date
 tells
 you
 the
 freshness.
 When
 you


have
 a
 back
 of
 coffee
 that
 is
 super


fresh.
 Let's
 say
 it's
 roasted
 yesterday


and
 you
 brew
 it
 right
 away.
 it's
 not


always
 going
 to
 be
 the
 best
 results


because
 there
 are
 still
 a
 lot
 of
 things


going
 on
 with
 the
 coffee
 after
 we
 finish


roasting.
 So,
 what
 we
 like
 is
 to
 have
 a


rest
 period.
 And
 that's
 one
 of
 the


reason
 why
 we
 want
 to
 pay
 attention
 to


the
 roast
 date.
 The
 sooner
 you
 brew
 your


coffee
 after
 the
 roast
 date,
 it's


actually
 harder
 for
 you
 to
 extract
 the


coffee.
 So
 it
 will
 not
 taste
 as
 good
 as


if
 the
 coffee
 has
 been
 sitting
 in
 the


bag
 for
 5
 days
 or
 more.


>> The
 flavors
 won't
 be
 as
 deep.


>> Yes.
 Um
 not
 only
 that,
 you
 might
 get
 a


lot
 of
 like
 smokiness,
 gassiness
 or
 what


we
 call
 like
 grassiness
 um
 right
 after


roast.
 And
 sometimes
 when
 we
 cup
 coffee


together,
 a
 very
 common
 flavor
 call
 that


we'll
 be
 getting
 if
 the
 coffee
 is
 way


too
 fresh
 is
 roasted
 beef.


>> O


>> yes.
 Um,
 so
 as
 soon
 as
 it
 rest
 and
 open


up,
 you'll
 get
 a
 lot
 more
 benefit
 from


the
 beverage
 itself.


>> So
 in
 terms
 of
 short
 hand,
 how
 long


generally
 are
 you
 going to
 want
 to
 wait?


>> Ideally
 7
 days.
 Rule
 of
 thumb
 is
 if
 you


have
 a
 lighter
 roast,
 chances
 of
 it


resting
 longer
 is
 going
 to
 be
 better.


>> Can
 you
 briefly
 explain
 the
 differences


between
 light,
 medium,
 and
 dark
 roasts?


light,
 medium
 and
 dark
 rose
 is
 uh
 when


we
 see
 the
 color
 of
 the
 beans
 itself


very
 very
 subjective
 because
 somebody's


dark
 rose
 can
 be
 somebody's
 medium
 rose


however
 uh
 what
 I
 like
 to
 see
 when


someone
 is
 talking
 about
 light
 medium


and
 dark
 roses
 it
 is
 almost
 always


reflected
 in
 the
 way
 that
 the
 back
 of


coffee
 has
 the
 calls.
 So
 light
 roast


coffee
 you
 will
 always
 see
 a
 lot
 of


herbaceious
 floral
 and
 fruit
 notes
 in


the
 back.


>> Okay.


>> Medium
 roast
 of
 coffee
 you
 will
 see
 a


little
 bit
 more
 of
 the
 fruit
 but
 at
 the


same
 time
 you
 get
 some
 sort
 of
 brown


sugar
 like
 vanilla
 or
 like
 cooked


berries.
 So
 like
 think
 about
 pineapple


or
 peach
 that
 you
 throw
 it
 on
 top
 of
 a


grill
 kind.
 So
 that
 will
 be
 your
 medium


roast.
 And
 if
 it's
 a
 dark
 rose,
 look
 out


for
 notes
 like
 caramel,
 dark
 chocolate,


roasted
 hazelnut,
 almonds.
 These
 are
 all


sign
 that
 can
 tell
 you
 a
 little
 bit
 more


on
 that.
 As
 long
 as
 you're
 not
 tasting


burnt
 or
 extreme
 bitterness
 from
 the


dark
 roast
 itself,
 it
 will
 be
 great
 as
 a


milk
 barriage
 or
 maybe
 that
 is
 the
 cup


of
 coffee
 that
 you
 need
 to
 wake
 you
 up


in
 the
 morning.


What
 are
 some
 of
 the
 ways
 you
 can


determine
 the
 taste
 of
 coffee
 beans


based
 on
 where
 they're
 from?
 M
 this
 is


exactly
 where
 gets
 very
 fascinating
 for


me.
 I
 love
 how
 coffee
 tastes
 in


different
 region.
 So
 coffee
 from
 the


Asian
 region
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 is
 going
 to


be
 lower
 acidity
 because
 of
 the


elevation
 and
 then
 coffee
 from
 the


Americas
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit


more
 mild
 in
 acidity
 and
 more
 spice


forward
 notes
 of
 apple
 and
 things
 like


that
 and
 then
 coffee
 from
 the
 African


region
 will
 be
 brighter
 fruier
 more


floral
 so
 these
 are
 all
 the
 classic
 but


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 changing
 right


now
 and
 people
 are
 getting
 more
 and
 more


creative
 with
 fermentation
 technique
 and


it
 throws
 me
 off
 all
 the
 time.
 So,
 I


have
 a
 cup
 of
 coffee
 just
 maybe
 two
 to
 3


weeks
 ago.
 It
 is
 actually
 a
 cup
 of


coffee
 from
 Indonesia.
 When
 I
 had
 it,
 it


tastes
 like
 almost
 an
 high
 elevation


Colombia


>> because
 of
 the
 anorobic
 natural
 process


that
 are
 putting
 on
 to
 it.
 So
 while
 we


all
 have
 something
 to
 ground
 us
 to
 the


taste,
 now
 things
 are
 getting
 more
 and


more
 complex.


>> Okay.
 So
 let's
 say
 I
 buy
 my
 coffee
 beans


at
 the
 grocery
 store.
 I'm
 in
 the
 aisle.


There
 are
 so
 many
 different
 options.


What
 is
 your
 general
 guidance
 when


you're
 looking
 up
 and
 down
 and
 trying
 to


reach
 for
 a
 bag
 of
 whole
 bean
 coffee?


What
 do
 I
 look
 for


>> when
 you're
 buying
 coffee
 in
 a
 grocery


store?
 I
 think
 the
 first
 thing
 is
 uh


pick
 the
 coffee
 that
 you
 like
 how
 it


tastes,
 the
 brew
 method
 it's
 roasted
 for


and
 then
 after
 that
 you
 can
 look
 into


regions
 that
 might
 excite
 you.
 You
 want


to
 see
 something
 that
 is
 very
 common
 or


not
 common
 if
 it's
 a
 blend
 or
 it's
 a


single
 origin
 and
 finally
 probably
 is


the
 roast
 date.
 You
 don't
 want
 to
 have


something
 that
 has
 been
 sitting
 on
 a


shelf
 for
 like
 6
 months
 or
 something


like
 that.


>> And
 also
 you
 want
 you
 it
 needs
 to
 have
 a


roast
 date.


>> Yes.
 I
 think
 highly
 likely
 you
 will
 see


a
 roast
 date
 on
 each
 and
 every
 bag
 of


coffee.


>> So,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 joining
 us.


This
 was
 amazingly
 helpful.
 Really,


really
 appreciate
 it.


>> Thank
 you,
 Rosie.


>> All
 right,
 that's
 it
 on
 coffee
 beans.


We'll
 link
 to
 the
 Coffee
 Project
 New


York
 website
 in
 our
 show
 notes.
 Thank


you
 for
 listening.
 Bye.
