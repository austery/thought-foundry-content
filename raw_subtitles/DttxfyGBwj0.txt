From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Michael


Bubaro.
 This
 is
 the
 daily.


Just
 hours
 before
 a
 federal
 immigration


officer
 killed
 Renee
 Good
 in
 her
 car,


the
 Minneapolis
 police
 chief
 warned
 that


a
 tragedy
 involving
 ICE
 and
 the
 people


of
 his
 city
 seemed
 inevitable.


Today
 I
 speak
 with
 that
 police
 chief


Brian
 O'Hara
 about
 his
 experience
 with


ICE
 in
 Minneapolis
 and
 why
 in
 his
 mind


the
 president's
 campaign
 of
 mass


deportation
 is
 undermining
 faith
 in


police
 departments
 like
 his.


It's
 Monday,
 January
 12th.


Chief
 O'Hara,
 thank
 you
 for
 making
 time


for
 us
 on


>> Sure.


>> a
 Sunday,
 no
 less
 than
 a
 very
 busy


weekend
 for
 you.


>> Sure.
 Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.


>> The
 past
 48
 hours
 were
 pretty


extraordinary


from
 the
 perspective
 of
 an
 outsider.


There
 were
 these
 enormous
 protests.
 I


believe
 you
 yourself
 ended
 up
 in
 the


middle
 of
 one
 of
 them.
 I've
 tried
 to


make
 sense
 of
 the
 video.
 I
 mean,


>> what
 has
 this
 been
 like
 for
 you?
 So
 what


happened
 was
 we
 had
 a
 protest
 start


outside
 of
 a
 hotel
 where
 people
 believed


federal
 law
 enforcement
 might
 be


staying.


>> They
 believed
 ICE
 agents
 were
 staying


there.
 Right.


>> Right.
 Exactly.
 During
 the
 course
 of


that
 protest
 in
 March
 is
 it
 sort
 of


transitioned
 into
 an
 unlawful
 assembly


and
 things
 that
 typically
 happen
 in


cities
 happen
 and
 a
 woman
 who
 was


disoriented
 drove
 her
 car
 onto
 a


sidewalk
 and
 the
 police
 were
 called
 to


respond.
 So
 while
 the
 police
 car
 was


there
 dealing
 with
 regular
 police
 work


uh
 suddenly
 they
 realized
 they
 had


become
 surrounded
 by
 this
 crowd
 which


had
 become
 unruly.
 So
 our
 officers
 uh


called
 in
 uh
 that
 they
 were
 unable
 to


drive
 out
 and
 I
 was
 in
 the
 area


personally
 with
 other
 police
 officers.


We
 just
 we
 quickly
 ran
 in
 to
 back
 the


crowd
 out
 to
 get
 a
 path
 for
 the
 police


car
 to
 come
 out.
 And
 I
 think
 because
 we


did
 that,
 I
 think
 that
 may
 have


contributed
 to
 emboldening
 an
 already


unruly
 crowd.
 And
 we
 very
 quickly
 called


in
 well
 over
 200
 additional
 police


officers.
 And
 then
 ultimately
 we
 wound


up
 placing
 uh
 30
 people
 under
 arrest
 for


unlawful
 assembly
 and
 releasing
 them.


It's
 been
 very
 taxing
 for
 all
 members
 of


the
 police
 department
 and
 this
 is
 a


situation
 that
 has
 been
 building
 up
 for


several
 weeks.
 A
 lot
 of
 the
 disturbances


and
 chaos
 that's
 been
 happening
 here
 as


a
 result
 of
 the
 manner
 in
 which
 some


federal
 enforcement
 activity
 is


happening
 is
 requiring
 our
 officers
 to


respond
 and
 step
 into
 situations
 and
 try


and
 restore
 the
 peace
 where
 often
 times


they
 themselves
 then
 become
 the
 target


of
 people's
 frustration.


>> Well,
 you're
 hinting
 at
 all
 this.
 The


reason
 we're
 talking
 to
 you,
 of
 course,


is
 because
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 ICE
 is


there,
 but
 because
 specifically
 of
 what


an
 ICE
 agent
 did
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 of


last
 week,
 the
 shooting
 of
 a
 Minneapolis


resident,
 Renee
 Good.
 A
 shooting
 that


killed
 Ms.
 Good.
 And
 at
 this
 point,


millions
 of
 people
 have
 watched
 the


video
 of
 that
 shooting
 from
 every


conceivable
 angle
 on
 social
 media,
 on
 TV


news.
 But
 there
 was
 a
 leadup
 to
 that


shooting
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 didn't
 watch


as
 closely
 and
 and
 didn't
 see
 on
 TV
 or


on
 YouTube
 and
 that
 was
 the
 arrival
 of
 a


large
 number
 of
 Immigration
 and
 Customs


Enforcement
 agents
 starting
 in
 early


December.
 And
 so
 that's
 where
 I
 want
 to


begin.


>> Take
 me
 back
 to
 that
 period
 for
 you
 as


police
 chief.
 What
 was
 your


understanding
 of
 why
 the
 president


decided
 to
 send
 these
 agents
 to
 your


city?


>> About
 a
 month
 ago
 in
 December,
 it
 seemed


like
 the
 public
 messaging
 was
 largely


political
 and
 and
 it
 was
 a
 result
 of
 a


real
 problem
 that
 does
 exist
 in
 the


state
 and
 that
 is
 a
 problem
 with
 fraud.


Uh
 dozens
 of
 people
 have
 been
 prosecuted


uh
 by
 the
 FBI
 and
 the
 US
 Attorney's


Office
 here
 in
 Minnesota.
 You're


referring
 to
 the
 fraud
 that
 had
 been


specifically
 highlighted.
 Yes.
 In
 the


Somali
 community
 in
 Minneapolis.
 And
 I


do
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 president's


message
 when
 he
 decided
 to
 send


specifically
 immigration
 officers
 to


Minneapolis.
 I
 mean,
 he
 was
 pretty


explicit
 about
 his
 thinking.
 In
 his
 mind


>> the
 Somali
 population
 in
 the
 city,
 which


is
 sizable
 and
 wellknown.


>> Yes.
 He
 described
 it
 as
 a
 community
 that


was
 sewing
 disorder,
 committing
 crimes,


basically
 in
 so
 many
 words,
 a
 community


of
 troublemakers
 who
 should
 be
 deported.


And
 I
 wonder
 what
 you
 made
 of
 that
 and


if
 it
 felt
 like
 that
 had
 been
 your


experience
 as
 chief.


>> Well,
 I'm
 from
 about
 10
 miles
 from
 lower


Manhattan
 is
 where
 I
 grew
 up.
 I
 was
 a


police
 officer
 for
 over
 20
 years
 in


Newark,
 New
 Jersey.
 But
 I
 had
 not
 known


any
 Somali
 Americans
 until
 I
 moved
 to


Minnesota.
 And
 the
 Somali
 Americans
 that


I
 have
 met
 here,
 including
 many
 of
 whom


are
 police
 officers
 uh
 in
 this
 city,


have
 been
 incredibly
 welcoming
 of
 me.


You
 know,
 so
 from
 a
 personal


perspective,


it
 was
 just
 bizarre
 because
 I'm
 also


aware
 that
 the
 overwhelming
 majority
 of


people
 from
 that
 community
 are
 American


citizens.


>> Well,
 from
 from
 a
 crime
 perspective,
 was


anything
 the
 president
 was
 saying
 true?


Well,
 there
 is
 a
 real
 problem
 with
 fraud


in
 the
 state
 and
 unfortunately
 that
 is


sort
 of
 lost
 now
 in
 all
 of
 this


political
 rhetoric
 and
 sort
 of
 the


extreme
 reactions
 that
 occur.


>> You're
 you're
 drawing
 a
 distinction


between
 fraud
 and
 kind
 of
 traditional


street
 crime.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> But
 you're
 acknowledging
 that
 there's


some
 level
 of
 fraud
 occurring
 perhaps
 in


this
 community.
 Perhaps
 that's
 what
 the


president
 is
 referring
 to.


>> Yes.


>> In
 your
 mind,
 that's
 distinct
 from


perhaps
 the
 crime
 that
 you
 you
 and
 your


officers
 are
 dealing
 with
 day
 in
 and
 day


out.


>> Yes,
 absolutely.
 Those
 cases
 that
 were


brought
 about
 uh
 leading
 to
 dozens
 and


dozens
 of
 of
 prosecutions
 were
 led
 by


the
 US
 attorney's
 office
 here
 in


Minnesota
 as
 well
 as
 the
 FBI.


>> Got
 it.
 So
 in
 in
 your
 mind,
 was
 this


planned
 deployment
 specifically
 of
 ICE


agents
 that
 the
 president
 asked
 for,
 was


it
 warranted?


>> I
 mean,
 there
 have
 been
 immigration


enforcement
 conducted
 in
 Minnesota


as
 long
 as
 there
 has
 been
 ICE.
 I
 think


the
 problem
 is
 what
 gets
 lost
 in
 this
 is


it's
 not
 necessarily
 about
 which
 laws


are
 being
 enforced.
 It's
 about
 how
 that


enforcement
 is
 happening.
 To
 the
 extent


that
 there
 are
 wellplanned,
 pre-planned,


targeted
 enforcement
 against
 people
 who


who
 are
 violating
 the
 law,
 I
 think
 all


of
 law
 enforcement
 can
 very
 clearly
 get


behind
 that.
 But
 to
 the
 extent
 that


things
 are
 being
 conducted
 that
 may
 not


be
 well
 planned,
 using
 tactics
 that


generally
 are
 not
 viewed
 as
 sound,
 that


may
 unnecessarily
 endanger
 the
 lives


both
 of
 law
 enforcement
 officers


conducting
 that
 enforcement
 as
 well
 as


the
 lives
 of
 people
 in
 the
 community.


Certainly,
 those
 are
 concerns
 that
 I


have
 to
 deal
 with
 and
 I
 am
 responsible


for
 as
 a
 professional
 managing
 my


agency.


>> Mhm.
 So
 it
 sounds
 like
 for
 you
 it's
 not


the
 fact
 of
 ICE
 coming
 that
 is
 the


issue,
 it's
 the
 way
 that
 that
 that
 ICE


came.
 So
 So
 let's
 talk
 about
 that.
 So


>> the
 president
 makes
 his
 case
 that


immigration
 enforcement
 should
 be


happening
 on
 a
 larger
 scale
 in


Minneapolis
 and
 in
 early
 December
 he


makes
 it
 happen.
 How
 did
 the
 operations


of
 these
 ICE
 agents
 work
 and
 how
 did
 it


start
 to
 affect
 the
 police
 department


that
 you
 run?
 What
 changed?
 I
 mean,


you're
 hinting
 that
 their
 tactics
 are


different.


>> Yes.
 So,
 we've
 just
 gotten
 a
 pretty


dramatic
 increase
 in
 911
 calls
 from


people
 in
 the
 community
 related
 to
 a
 lot


of
 the
 street
 enforcement
 that's


happening.
 And
 I
 mean
 it's
 everything


from
 people
 are
 being
 arrested
 and
 their


cars
 are
 left
 in
 the
 roadway
 sometimes


blocking
 the
 street
 and
 at
 one
 case
 left


when
 it
 wasn't
 even
 placed
 in
 park
 and


was
 rolling
 down
 the
 road.


>> Wait.
 So
 so
 ICE
 officials
 are
 are
 are


taking
 someone
 out
 of
 their
 car,


arresting
 them
 and
 their
 car
 is
 not
 even


put
 in
 park.


>> We
 had
 that
 happen.
 We
 had
 another
 time


where
 there
 was
 a
 dog
 in
 the
 car
 and


they
 left
 the
 dog
 in
 the
 car.


>> Wow.
 I
 mean,
 even
 this
 morning,
 we've


gotten
 calls
 for
 individuals
 who
 were


pepper-sprayed
 by
 ICE.
 There's
 just
 a


variety
 of
 calls
 for
 service
 that
 we


then
 have
 to
 manage
 and
 triage
 that
 were


not
 happening
 before.


>> And
 how
 does
 that
 sudden
 influx
 of
 911


calls
 because
 people
 are
 experiencing


ICE
 tactics
 affect
 the
 department
 as
 a


whole?
 How
 does
 it
 complicate
 your


policing?


>> It
 complicates
 things
 because
 we
 remain


significantly
 understaffed.
 This
 is
 the


Minneapolis
 Police
 Department.
 The


majority
 of
 the
 cops
 that
 worked
 here
 in


2020,
 5
 years
 later,
 the
 majority
 have


left
 and
 we're
 trying
 to
 rebuild.
 We


remain
 one-third
 below
 what
 had
 been


typical
 of
 of
 staffing
 for
 the
 police


department
 here
 today.
 While
 we're


dealing
 with
 a
 much
 higher
 level
 of


serious
 street
 crime
 than
 what
 had
 been


normal
 in
 the
 past.
 So,
 this
 is
 adding


additional
 work.
 Probably
 the
 toughest


distinction
 is
 we're
 getting
 called
 and


pulled
 into
 situations
 that
 are
 very


tense
 and
 very
 emotionally
 charged
 and


often
 times
 we're
 asked
 to
 try
 and
 step


in
 and
 deescalate
 situations
 where


federal
 law
 enforcement
 may
 have
 been


involved
 that
 very
 very
 quickly
 as
 soon


as
 we
 show
 up
 we
 become
 the
 target
 of


people's
 frustration.
 H.
 So
 the
 minute


you
 show
 up,


>> the
 minute
 we
 show
 up,
 we're
 the


problem.
 You
 know,
 people
 are
 ready
 to


go,
 it
 could
 very
 very
 quickly
 explode.


And
 with
 the
 level
 of
 staffing
 that
 we


have
 and
 the
 time
 that
 it
 takes
 to
 get


the
 National
 Guard
 to
 come
 in,
 it
 will


be
 too
 late.
 That's
 my
 fear.


I
 mean,
 you've
 been
 talking
 around
 this,


and
 I
 think
 we
 should
 just
 make
 this


extremely
 explicit,
 that
 you
 come
 to
 the


job
 of
 being
 police
 chief
 in
 Minneapolis


at
 a
 very
 specific
 moment
 with
 a
 very


specific
 mandate.
 You
 arrive
 just
 two


years
 after
 a
 Minneapolis
 police
 officer


murdered
 George
 Floyd
 at
 a
 moment
 of


extremely
 low
 morale
 for
 the
 department


and
 really
 high
 levels
 of
 distrust
 of


the
 police
 department
 by
 the
 community.


And
 when
 you
 took
 this
 job,
 I
 went
 back


and
 looked
 at
 the
 old
 clips.
 You
 called


Minneapolis
 ground
 zero
 for
 a
 global


reckoning
 on
 policing.
 and
 you
 in
 the


job
 put
 in
 place
 sweeping
 reforms
 to
 try


to
 rebuild
 trust,
 repair
 relationships


between
 police
 and
 residents.
 Just
 give


us
 a
 couple
 examples
 of
 the
 reforms
 you


put
 in
 place
 and
 that
 presumably
 are
 now


being
 somewhat
 challenged
 by
 ISIS


presence.


>> So,
 we
 have
 placed
 a
 very
 strong


emphasis
 on
 use
 of
 force,
 on
 employing


deescalation,


on
 the
 use
 of
 critical
 decision-making


practices.
 We
 have
 gone
 out
 and
 had


dozens
 of
 community
 meetings
 to
 get


input
 from
 community
 as
 we
 revise
 our


policies.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 it
 all
 boils


down
 to


trying
 to
 fight
 crime
 in
 a
 way
 that


earns
 community
 trust
 as
 opposed
 to


alienating
 people.
 And
 from
 what
 you're


saying,
 suddenly,
 as
 of
 a
 few
 weeks
 ago,


all
 of
 that
 work


is
 confronted
 with
 an
 outside
 group
 of


federal
 law
 enforcement
 officials


arriving
 in
 your
 city
 doing
 police
 work,


but
 who
 don't
 answer
 to
 you
 and
 are
 not


as
 inevitably
 invested
 in
 the
 reform


efforts
 that
 you
 have
 put
 in
 place.
 They


have a
 totally
 different
 mandate.
 And
 it


sounds
 like
 you're
 saying
 all
 of
 a


sudden
 that
 is
 just
 immediately


overshadowing,
 challenging,
 complicating


this
 entire
 project
 that
 you
 have


overtaken
 as
 police
 chief.


>> Absolutely.
 And
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 all
 of


those
 challenges,
 while
 we're
 trying
 to


heal
 this
 community,
 while
 we're
 trying


to
 heal
 the
 men
 and
 women
 who
 have


remained
 here
 and
 rebuild,
 while
 they're


already
 the
 most
 scrutinized
 police


department
 in
 the
 nation
 and
 and
 I
 can


tell
 you
 like
 the
 cops
 here,
 we're
 human


beings.
 And
 it's
 I
 worry
 that
 we
 might


hit
 a
 breaking
 point.
 It
 feels
 like
 as


the
 weeks
 went
 on
 here
 that
 residents


are
 taking
 it
 upon
 themselves
 to
 monitor


ICE
 agents
 and
 their
 activity.


>> Minneapolis,
 this
 is
 not
 a
 secret
 pretty


liberal
 city.
 And
 there
 are


>> residents
 who
 organize
 themselves
 in


this
 period
 into
 groups.
 They're


shadowing
 ICE
 agents.
 They're
 texting


each
 other.
 They're
 blowing
 whistles.


and
 it's
 amounting
 to
 a
 pretty


meaningful
 effort
 to
 counter
 their


enforcement
 operations.
 I
 don't
 know if


you
 quibble
 with
 that
 word.
 Does
 that


become
 its
 own
 problem?
 And
 did
 you
 find


yourself
 wishing
 that
 the
 residents
 were


not
 doing
 that?
 Did
 you
 try
 to


discourage
 it?


Well,
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 the
 role
 of
 the


police
 and
 law
 enforcement
 in
 the
 United


States
 is
 first
 off
 to
 protect
 life,
 but


it's
 also
 to
 ensure
 people's
 human


rights
 and
 their
 constitutional
 rights.


And
 people
 in
 this
 country
 have
 a
 first


amendment
 right
 to
 observe,
 record,
 and


object
 to
 government
 activity.
 And
 that


includes
 the
 activity
 that
 Minneapolis


police
 officers
 do
 as
 well
 as
 other
 law


enforcement
 in
 our
 city.
 And
 so
 it
 is
 a


challenge,
 but
 it's
 a
 challenge
 that


policing
 in
 America
 has
 been
 dealing


with
 and
 and
 trying
 to
 improve
 upon
 uh


for
 many
 years.
 It
 does
 add
 a
 level
 of


complication
 to
 our
 work.
 But
 I
 I
 just


want
 to
 be
 clear
 though.
 I'm
 not
 asking


for
 federal
 law
 enforcement
 to
 do


anything
 differently
 than
 what
 I
 expect


the
 men
 and
 women
 of
 the
 Minneapolis


Police
 Department
 to
 do.


>> What
 you're
 describing
 clearly
 sounds


like
 a
 pretty
 combustible
 combination.


You've
 got
 ICE
 agents
 who
 are
 operating


with
 their
 own
 systems
 and
 set
 of
 rules


and
 then
 you
 have
 these
 residents
 in


your
 words
 operating
 the
 first
 amendment


right
 to
 surround
 them
 to
 monitor
 them


to
 scream
 at
 them
 and
 this
 is
 adding
 up


to
 clearly


>> yes


>> a
 very
 delicate
 situation
 and
 there's
 a


moment
 that
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 about


because
 it
 felt


>> oddly
 preient
 where
 within
 the
 last
 week


or
 so
 You
 stand
 up
 at
 a
 news
 conference


and
 you
 say
 basically
 I
 am
 worried.


>> I
 I
 do
 have
 an
 ask
 that's
 both
 for


federal
 law
 enforcement
 who


>> you
 say
 may
 not
 be
 from


>> ICE
 agents.
 You
 have
 your
 job
 to
 do
 but


please
 do
 it
 lawfully.


>> Um
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time
 to
 members
 of


the
 community


>> residents
 yes
 you
 can
 have
 your
 protest.


Please
 do
 it
 peacefully.
 officially.
 Uh


I've
 been
 concerned
 for
 weeks
 that


because
 the
 issue
 is
 so
 emotional
 and


because
 frankly
 some
 of
 the
 way
 this


stuff
 has
 been
 carried
 out,
 the
 greatest


risk
 to
 me
 is
 that
 there
 would
 be
 unrest


or
 that
 there
 would
 be
 a
 tragedy,
 that


somebody
 could
 get
 seriously
 hurt
 or


killed.


>> But
 you
 seem
 to
 kind
 of
 know
 that


something
 awful
 was
 coming.


>> Yes.


I
 mean,
 this
 was
 predictable
 and
 it's


also
 entirely
 preventable.
 I
 mean,
 I
 had


been
 saying
 it
 for
 weeks.
 I
 literally


said
 it
 at
 a
 press
 conference
 the
 day


before.


>> And
 when
 you
 found
 out
 that
 it
 was
 true


that
 there
 was
 a
 shooting
 involving
 an


ICE
 agent,
 what
 was
 your
 first
 thought?


>> I
 mean,
 I'm
 having
 a
 hard
 time


describing
 it.


I
 I
 just
 thought,


[ __ ]
 this
 is
 it,
 you
 know?
 This
 is
 the


potential
 here
 for
 2020
 all
 over
 again,


>> for
 George
 Floyd
 all
 over
 again.


>> For
 the
 destruction
 of
 the
 city.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


So,
 I
 understand
 that
 an
 investigation


is
 still
 underway
 of
 what
 happened
 in


this
 shooting
 and
 we
 don't
 know
 exactly


what
 that
 investigation
 is
 going
 to
 look


like
 or
 what
 it's
 going
 to
 conclude.
 and


and
 we'll
 talk
 in
 just
 a
 few
 moments


about
 the
 conflict
 arising
 from
 the


investigation
 over
 whose
 investigation


it
 should
 be.
 But
 just
 to
 focus
 for
 a


minute
 on
 the
 shooting
 itself.


>> Mhm.


>> Have
 you
 watched
 the
 videos?


>> Yes,
 I've
 seen
 the
 videos
 that
 are


available
 online.


>> What
 is
 your
 understanding
 of
 how
 this


unfolded?


My
 understanding
 is
 that
 there
 was
 a


woman
 who
 was
 in
 her
 car
 and
 was


blocking
 the
 street.


>> That's
 fine,
 dude.


>> I'm
 not
 mad
 at
 you.


>> Likely
 because
 immigration
 agents
 were


present.
 Uh,
 and
 she
 was
 likely


protesting
 in
 some
 way
 immigration


officials
 being
 present.


>> Get
 out
 of
 the
 [ __ ]
 car.
 And


ultimately
 some
 confrontation
 occurred


uh
 where
 federal
 law
 enforcement
 shot


into
 the
 vehicle


>> killing
 her.


>> [ __ ]
 [ __ ]


>> What
 the


>> What
 did
 you
 do?


>> You


shame


shame


>> shame.
 Shame.
 H
 having
 watched
 the


videos
 and
 spoken
 perhaps
 to
 responding


officers,
 does
 this
 strike
 you
 as
 a


lawful
 interaction
 between
 the
 ICE


officer
 and
 the
 resident?
 Well,
 I
 can


tell
 you
 as
 a
 police
 officer
 for
 25


years,
 anytime
 you
 hear
 a
 situation


where
 a
 cop
 gets
 into
 a
 shooting
 with
 an


unarmed
 motorist,
 it
 gives
 you
 pause
 and


it's
 very
 concerning
 because
 while


policies
 and
 training
 try
 to
 do


everything
 possible
 to
 prohibit
 those


situations
 and
 to
 try
 and
 prevent
 them


from
 occurring
 in
 the
 first
 place,
 there


are
 times
 unfortunately


where
 law
 enforcement
 cannot
 avoid
 those


situations
 from
 occurring.
 The
 concern


is
 as
 a
 professional


to
 try
 and
 prevent
 our
 people
 from


getting
 into
 that
 situation
 in
 the
 first


place
 so
 that
 we're
 not
 unnecessarily


creating
 the
 risk
 unjustifiably.


>> Well,
 let's
 talk
 about
 that.
 You


mentioned
 training.
 My
 sense
 is
 that


there
 are
 some
 pretty
 universal
 rules


around
 policing
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 a


motorist
 in
 a
 running
 car.


>> The
 number
 one
 is
 you
 don't
 place


yourself
 in
 the
 path
 of
 the
 vehicle.


That's
 like
 traffic
 stop
 101.
 You
 don't


do
 that.


>> So
 in
 your
 mind
 that's
 a
 flag
 that
 you


have
 this
 ICE
 agent,
 the
 one
 who
 ends
 up


shooting
 Renee
 Good
 standing
 in
 front
 of


her
 car.


>> Absolutely.
 And
 then
 the
 other
 one
 is


what
 exactly
 is
 the
 mission
 here?


Because
 if
 this
 person
 isn't
 the
 target


of
 a
 pre-planned
 enforcement
 action,


then
 what
 are
 we
 doing?
 Are
 we
 trying
 to


deescalate
 and
 try
 and
 resolve
 the


situation?
 Are
 we
 trying
 to
 take
 an


enforcement
 action
 and
 enforce
 some
 law


here
 or
 what
 exactly
 is
 is
 the
 goal?


>> We're
 focusing
 here
 on
 the
 ICE
 officers.


I
 do
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 about
 the
 driver's


decision-m


>> in
 this
 moment.
 Her
 refusal
 to
 get
 out


of
 the
 car
 even
 after
 ICE
 agents
 demand


that
 she
 get
 out
 of
 the
 car.
 Her


reversing
 then
 driving
 forward.
 She


appears
 to
 disobey
 spoken
 orders
 from


from
 these
 officers.
 As
 somebody
 who


thinks
 about
 this
 stuff,
 let's
 just
 ask


this
 really
 plainly.
 Was
 she
 in
 the


wrong?


Well,
 I
 can
 only
 speak
 to
 conducting
 the


traffic
 stop
 from
 my
 perspective
 as
 a


police
 officer.
 What
 is
 our
 policy?
 What


is
 our
 training?
 Number
 one,
 you


approach
 the
 driver.
 You
 introduce


yourself
 by
 rank,
 by
 name,
 by
 what


agency
 you
 work
 for.
 And
 you
 tell
 the


person,
 explain
 why
 the
 person
 is
 being


stopped.
 You
 do
 these
 sorts
 of
 things
 to


try
 and
 ensure
 one
 number
 one
 to


identify
 yourself
 but
 to
 try
 and
 ensure


a
 level
 of
 professionalism
 and
 to
 try


and
 deescalate.
 If
 the
 person
 asks
 you
 a


question
 that's
 reasonable,
 you
 respond


to
 it
 reasonably.
 Like
 that
 is
 the


expectation.


>> And
 did
 the
 ICE
 agent
 do
 any
 of
 that?
 My


recollection
 is
 that
 any
 of
 that
 and


further
 it
 just
 seems
 like
 there's


confusion
 and
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 just
 from


what
 I
 recall
 but
 it
 seems
 like
 someone


else
 is
 saying
 to
 get
 out
 of
 the
 car


than
 the
 officer
 who
 shot
 and
 I
 just


it's
 not
 clear
 to
 me
 whether
 the
 two
 of


them
 were
 working
 together
 and


understood
 what
 each
 other
 was
 trying
 to


accomplish.


>> Do
 you
 feel
 that
 this
 would
 have
 ended


differently
 had
 this
 been
 handled


entirely
 by
 the
 MPD,
 not
 ICE?


>> No
 question.
 Do
 you
 have
 any
 empathy
 for


the
 ICE
 officer
 given
 the
 splitsecond


nature
 of
 of
 policing?
 Putting
 aside


whether
 he
 should
 have
 ever
 been
 in


front
 of
 the
 car.


>> Yes,
 absolutely.
 Law
 enforcement


leaders,
 executives
 have
 an
 obligation


to
 their
 people.
 We
 have
 an
 obligation


to
 ensure
 that
 our
 people
 have


sufficient
 policies,
 sufficient


training,
 sufficient
 experiences


for
 the
 challenges
 that
 we
 are
 placing


them
 into.
 We
 have
 an
 obligation
 not
 to


send
 our
 people
 out
 there
 and
 to
 tell


them,
 you
 know,
 you
 have
 a
 specific


quota
 today.
 You
 have
 to
 get
 a
 certain


number
 of
 people.
 I
 mean,
 it
 seems
 like


that's
 the
 situation
 these
 folks
 are


being
 placed
 into.
 And
 that
 went
 out
 the


window
 a
 long
 time
 ago
 in
 professional


policing.
 And
 considering
 this
 agent
 was


seriously
 injured
 in
 a
 stop,
 you
 know,


somewhat
 recently,
 it
 certainly
 raises


questions
 as
 to
 what
 did
 the
 agency
 do


to
 protect
 their
 person.


>> You're
 you're
 referring
 to
 the
 fact
 that


I
 believe
 this
 officer
 in
 the
 Times
 has


written
 about
 it
 was
 involved
 in
 a
 stop


where
 he
 was
 dragged
 in
 a
 car.


>> Yes.
 He
 sustained
 significant
 bodily


injury.
 For
 sure.
 So
 what
 did
 the
 agency


do
 to
 ensure
 that
 that
 officer
 would
 not


be
 unsafe
 in
 similar
 situations?


>> Right.
 I
 mean,
 you
 were
 basically


raising
 questions
 about
 whether
 ICE


agents
 are
 sufficiently
 trained
 to


handle
 these
 kinds
 of
 encounters.


>> Yes.
 And
 whether
 or
 not


>> Do
 you
 think
 they
 are?


>> I
 don't
 have
 specific
 information
 about


that.
 I
 just
 know
 what
 I've
 read.
 I
 know


what's
 been
 reported.
 It's
 been
 reported


>> that
 they're
 not
 even
 getting
 the
 level


of
 training
 that
 they
 used
 to
 get.
 That


the
 the
 time
 of
 training
 is
 less.
 I


think
 that's
 concerning.
 And
 I
 do
 think


they
 are
 being
 forced
 into
 situations
 in


which
 they
 are
 not
 well
 prepared
 to
 deal


with.


>> Let
 me
 turn
 to
 the
 investigation
 and
 I


want
 to
 ask
 you
 about
 two
 issues
 that


have
 arisen
 with
 this
 investigation.
 The


first
 of
 course
 is
 that
 the
 federal


government
 has
 blocked
 local
 officials


from
 participating
 in
 the
 investigation


and
 they
 basically
 argue
 that
 because
 of


comments
 made
 by
 your
 boss,
 Mayor
 Jacob


Fry,
 that
 local
 officials
 can't
 be


objective.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 you've
 got


the
 Trump
 administration
 out
 there


basically
 saying,
 you
 know,
 Renee
 Good


is
 entirely
 at
 fault
 and
 the
 ICE
 officer


did
 nothing
 wrong
 here.
 So,
 can
 they
 be


objective?
 I
 mean,
 h
 how
 are
 you
 making


sense
 of
 what
 has
 become
 an
 incredibly


messy
 and
 contentious
 situation
 over


what
 I
 normally
 think
 of
 as
 everybody


doing
 joint
 investigations
 of
 of
 a


tragic
 situation?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 the
 loss
 here
 is
 the
 loss


of
 any
 trust
 that
 the
 investigation


would
 be
 legitimate.
 M


>> and
 I
 tell
 you,
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 FBI


agents
 here.
 I
 believe
 the
 FBI
 will


still
 do
 a
 thorough
 investigation
 cuz


that's
 what
 they
 do.
 That's
 what
 the


people
 who
 staff
 this
 agency
 here,


that's
 what
 they
 do
 every
 day.


>> But
 will
 Minneapolis
 residents
 believe


that
 it's
 a
 serious
 investigation?


>> But
 that's
 the
 problem.
 The
 way
 this
 has


played
 out
 has
 taken
 all
 sense
 of


legitimacy
 away
 from
 many
 people,
 and


that's
 very
 unfortunate.
 I
 want
 to
 talk


about
 what
 happens
 next
 now
 in
 the
 city


as
 this
 investigation
 for
 which
 there


may
 not
 be
 much
 faith
 locally
 unfolds


because
 in
 the
 wake
 of
 this
 shooting
 and


these
 protests,
 your
 governor
 has


dispatched
 the
 National
 Guard
 to


Minneapolis.
 The
 president
 is


dispatching
 or
 plans
 to
 dispatch
 far


more
 federal
 officials,
 border
 patrol


agents.
 Is
 that
 just
 going
 to
 magnify


all
 the
 challenges
 that
 we
 have
 been


talking
 about
 here?


Well,
 I
 had
 asked
 the
 mayor
 to
 have
 the


National
 Guard
 on
 standby
 as
 this
 was


initially
 unfolding
 because
 it
 was
 so


unpredictable.


>> I
 was
 afraid
 that
 once
 it
 came
 to
 the


point
 where
 we
 might
 need
 the
 National


Guard,
 it
 would
 probably
 take
 too
 long


to
 get
 them
 here.


>> So,
 that's
 why
 I'm
 glad
 they
 were
 on


standby.
 Going
 forward,
 it's
 my


understanding
 that
 there
 is
 additional


federal
 law
 enforcement
 being
 added
 to


the
 state
 specifically
 to
 conduct
 more


of
 these
 operations.
 That
 is
 concerning.


If
 this
 escalates,
 are
 you
 worried,


Chief
 O'Hara,
 that
 all
 of
 this
 is
 just


going
 to
 erase
 the
 work
 you've
 done
 over


the
 past
 four
 plus
 years
 to
 rebuild
 and


repair
 the
 community's
 trust
 in
 the


Minneapolis
 Police
 Department?


The
 number
 one
 priority
 that
 I
 worry


about
 in
 terms
 of
 erasing
 work
 that


we've
 done
 is
 ultimately
 erasing
 the


gains
 that
 we've
 made
 rebuilding
 the


department
 and
 being
 able
 to
 reduce


crime.
 Mhm.


>> You
 know,
 in
 June
 of
 2020,
 immediately


after
 the
 destruction
 of
 the
 city,
 the


burning
 of
 a
 police
 station
 here,
 in


that
 one
 month,
 we
 had
 about
 as
 many


shootings
 in
 one
 month
 as
 the
 city
 used


to
 have
 in
 half
 a
 year.


>> And
 that
 level
 of
 crime
 stayed
 very


high.
 And
 you
 know,
 now
 the
 last
 couple


of
 years
 has
 started
 to
 come
 down.
 And


it's
 come
 down
 despite
 not
 having
 enough


officers.
 and
 we
 finally
 have
 started
 to


rebuild
 and
 I'm
 just
 afraid
 if
 we
 have


another
 large-scale
 unrest
 that
 we
 are


go
 both
 going
 to
 have
 a
 dramatic


increase
 in
 crime
 yet
 again
 that's


predictable
 as
 well
 as
 another
 mass


exodus
 of
 the
 department
 and
 we
 just
 we


we
 cannot
 sustain
 that.
 I
 mean,
 is
 there


any
 part
 of
 you
 that
 feels
 that
 this


moment
 could
 strengthen
 the
 relationship


between
 the
 community
 and
 police
 and


test
 this
 work
 and
 reveal
 that
 you
 all


have
 made
 progress
 that
 people
 will
 see


a
 distinction
 between
 the
 MPD
 and
 the


feds?


>> I
 know
 that
 is
 true.
 I've
 had
 many


people
 reach
 out
 and
 activists
 reach
 out


u
 our
 elected
 officials,
 many
 people
 who


typically
 have
 nothing
 good
 to
 say
 about


the
 Minneapolis
 police


have
 been
 incredibly
 complimentary
 of


how
 well,
 how
 restrained,
 how


disciplined
 the
 Minneapolis
 police


officers
 have
 been
 in
 these
 very,
 very


tense
 situations
 over
 the
 last
 several


days.


>> Mhm.


>> But
 it's
 not
 universal.
 You
 know,


there's
 people
 here
 who,
 despite
 what's


happening,
 seem
 to
 think
 it's
 our
 job
 to


do
 ISIS's
 job.
 There's
 people
 here
 to


seem
 to
 think
 that
 that
 we
 should


continue
 to
 make
 the
 same
 failed


mistakes
 of
 the
 past
 when
 dealing
 with


protests
 and
 crowd
 control
 and
 not


utilize
 the
 best
 practices
 to
 deescalate


and
 to
 keep
 everyone
 safe.
 Are
 we
 fully


aware
 of
 that?
 Of
 course
 not.
 We're
 not.


We
 haven't
 accomplished
 winning
 trust


with
 all
 levels
 of
 the
 community.
 That


was
 obvious
 this
 week
 with
 all
 the
 the


hate
 and
 vitriol
 that
 was
 directed


towards
 our
 officers,


but
 there's
 certainly
 been
 progress.


Just
 to
 end
 this
 conversation,
 Chief,


how
 do
 you
 think
 you
 get
 back
 to
 a


simpler
 time
 in
 your
 policing
 where
 you


can
 be
 focused
 on
 the
 reforms
 that
 you


brought
 to
 the
 city
 on
 repairing


relations
 between
 police
 and
 the


community?
 And
 in
 your
 mind,
 does
 ICE,


does
 Border
 Patrol,
 do
 all
 these
 federal


agents
 need
 to
 leave
 the
 city
 for
 you
 to


do
 that?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 think
 everybody
 wants
 to
 get


back
 to
 some
 sense
 of
 normaly
 and
 I


think
 that
 does
 involve


some
 level
 of
 returning
 to
 some
 basic


things
 that
 we
 accepted
 as
 normal.
 You


know,
 that
 obviously
 isn't
 federal
 law


enforcement
 stops
 enforcing
 federal
 law.


That's
 not
 the
 answer
 either.
 But
 it


does
 have
 to
 do
 with
 having
 an
 honest


conversation


about
 reality.
 We've
 had
 many
 instances


of
 people
 being
 stopped,
 family
 members


of
 police
 officers
 being
 stopped
 that


are
 American
 citizens


>> by
 ICE.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 definitely
 at
 best
 it
 is


definitely
 questionable.
 They're
 not


stopping
 family
 members
 of
 folks
 who
 are


Norwegian
 or
 Irish.
 That's
 not


happening.
 Hm.
 Just
 to
 return
 to
 that


question,
 can
 your
 work
 at
 its
 best


coexist
 with
 the
 work
 of
 a
 organization


like
 ICE?


>> We
 are
 doing
 it
 right
 now
 and
 we
 are


proving
 to
 the
 world
 that
 this
 is


possible.
 That
 this
 is
 not
 the
 same


police
 department
 it
 was
 5
 years
 ago
 or


10
 years
 ago
 or
 15
 years
 ago.
 But
 it
 is


an
 unbelievable
 stress
 on
 everyone


involved.


And
 I
 think
 everybody
 needs
 to
 turn
 the


heat
 down


and
 hopefully
 get
 some
 sense
 of
 normaly


some
 basic
 things
 to
 return.


>> Chief,
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 your


time.
 We
 really
 appreciate
 it.


>> Thank
 you,
 Michael.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.


As
 massive
 anti-government
 protests


spread
 across
 Iran
 over
 the
 weekend,


Iran's
 president
 vowed
 to
 address
 the


country's
 economic
 problems,
 but
 showed


no
 signs
 of
 backing
 off
 a
 harsh


crackdown
 on
 demonstrators.
 That


crackdown,
 activists
 say,
 may
 have


killed
 as
 many
 as
 200
 people
 over
 the


past
 few
 days.


>> So,
 Iran's
 in
 big
 trouble.
 It
 looks
 to


me
 that
 the
 people
 are
 taking
 over


certain
 cities
 that
 nobody
 thought
 were


really
 possible
 just
 a
 few
 weeks
 ago.


>> Meanwhile,
 the
 Trump
 administration
 is


warning
 Iran's
 leaders
 that
 it
 could


strike
 Iran
 if
 the
 regime
 continues
 to


kill
 peaceful
 protesters.


The
 Times
 reports
 that
 US
 military


leaders
 have
 begun
 to
 brief
 President


Trump
 on
 options
 for
 such
 strikes.
 that


if
 they
 start
 killing
 people
 like
 they


have
 in
 the
 past,
 we
 will
 get
 involved.


We'll
 be
 hitting
 them
 very
 hard
 where
 it


hurts.
 And
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 boots
 on


the
 ground,
 but
 it
 means
 hitting
 them


very,
 very
 hard
 where
 it
 hurts.
 So,


>> and
 the
 Trump
 administration
 is


escalating
 its
 longunning
 feud
 with
 the


chairman
 of
 the
 Federal
 Reserve,
 Jerome


Powell,
 by
 opening
 a
 criminal


investigation
 into
 his
 conduct.
 The


investigation
 centers
 around
 whether


Powell
 lied
 to
 Congress
 about
 the
 scope


of
 a
 multibillion
 dollar
 renovation


project
 of
 the
 Fed's
 headquarters.
 But


Trump's
 original
 conflict
 with
 Powell


stems
 from
 his
 unwillingness
 to


significantly
 slash
 interest
 rates
 as


President
 Trump
 had
 demanded.
 A
 reality


that
 Powell
 highlighted
 in
 a
 video


released
 on
 Sunday
 night.
 The
 threat
 of


criminal
 charges
 is
 a
 consequence
 of
 the


Federal
 Reserve
 setting
 interest
 rates


based
 on
 our
 best
 assessment
 of
 what


will
 serve
 the
 public
 rather
 than


following
 the
 preferences
 of
 the


president.
