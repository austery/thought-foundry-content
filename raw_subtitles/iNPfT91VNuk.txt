All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 the
 channel.
 We
 are
 starting
 about
 10


minutes
 early


and
 we're
 live
 folks.
 We
 got
 the
 rate


cut.
 25
 basis
 points.
 It
 is
 official
 and


it
 has
 happened.
 My
 by
 Mr.
 Jerome
 Pow.


Now,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 nuance
 to
 what


we're
 looking
 at
 here
 and
 there's
 a


bunch
 of
 different
 things
 to
 discuss
 in


regards
 to
 the
 rate
 cuts.
 In
 fact,
 the


rate
 cuts
 are
 quite
 frankly
 not
 even
 the


most
 important
 part
 of
 the
 story.
 The


the
 more
 important
 part
 is
 the


quantitative
 easing
 that
 the
 Fed


announced
 that
 we'll
 get
 into
 for
 a


second.
 But
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 has
 cut


interest
 rates
 by
 25
 basis
 points.
 There


was
 a
 90%
 probability
 as
 of
 this


morning.
 It
 has
 officially
 happened
 in


about
 20
 minutes.
 We
 will
 have
 JP
 Pal


and
 we'll
 see
 what
 he
 has
 to
 say.
 There


were
 nine
 votes
 for
 cutting
 25
 bips.
 An


overwhelming
 majority
 of
 the
 Federal


Open
 Market
 Committee
 decided
 to
 cut


rates.
 Two
 votes
 against
 cutting,
 one


vote
 for
 cutting
 50
 bips.
 So
 you
 had


Moran
 who
 went
 for
 50
 bips.
 You
 had
 uh
 I


believe
 Goulsby
 who
 went
 for
 the
 cut
 and


or
 went
 against
 the
 cut
 and
 then
 you
 had


nine
 votes
 for
 cutting
 that
 25
 basis


points
 for
 today.
 Now,
 the
 outlook
 by


the
 Fed,
 the
 summary
 of
 economic


projections,
 which
 is
 uh
 a
 bit
 more


important
 here,
 and
 this
 is
 the
 part


that's
 actually
 quite
 surprising,
 even


though
 it's
 kind
 of
 not
 surprising,
 is


only
 suggesting
 one
 more
 cut
 in
 2026
 and


one
 more
 cut
 in
 2027,


which
 would
 be
 quite
 incredible
 if
 that


actually
 is
 the
 case.
 But
 nonetheless,


it
 seems
 like
 that
 at
 least
 could
 be


what
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 now
 can
 change


dramatically.
 But
 this
 is
 what
 they're


suggesting
 right
 here.
 This
 is
 the
 dot


plot.
 Uh
 in
 2025,
 the
 street
 was


expecting
 3.62%.
 That's
 what
 we're
 going


to
 get.
 3.625.
 Uh
 2026
 3.375.
 2027
 3.12.


These
 are
 on
 the
 federal
 interest
 rates.


And
 then
 2028
 also
 3.123.


So
 the
 idea
 of
 getting
 the
 federal


interest
 rate
 down
 to
 like
 2.75%


3%
 by
 the
 end
 of
 next
 year.
 Maybe.
 It's


a
 big
 maybe
 because
 right
 now
 uh
 you


know
 JPA's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 there
 in


March
 or
 in
 May
 and
 we'll
 see
 who


replaces
 him.
 But
 right
 now,
 the
 people


on
 the
 FOMC
 are
 saying
 that
 we
 think
 the


most
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 to
 in
 2026
 is


3.375%.


That
 would
 only
 be
 another
 25
 basis


points.


Um,
 which
 is
 not
 necessarily
 the
 best


thing,
 but
 nonetheless,
 the
 market
 likes


it.
 Now,
 before
 we
 talk
 about
 the


quantitative
 easing,
 let's
 just
 take
 a


quick
 look
 at
 the
 markets.
 S&P
 685.
 So,


you
 got
 to
 move
 right
 there.
 Again,
 I


wouldn't
 trust
 any
 of
 the
 candles
 you're


seeing
 right
 now.
 Realistically
 when
 Pal


talks
 and
 when
 he
 actually
 starts


speaking
 about
 what's
 going
 on
 uh
 in
 the


context
 of
 interest
 rates
 we'll
 get
 a


better
 understanding
 but
 the
 S&P
 is

 got
 from

today.
 Rocket
 Lab,
 massive
 move,
 9%.


Absolutely
 gigantic
 move
 on
 Rocket
 Lab.


By
 the
 way,
 Bloomberg
 reported
 this


morning,
 and
 we'll
 talk
 more
 about
 this,


that
 Elon,
 in
 the
 discussions
 for
 the


new
 secondary
 sales
 of
 SpaceX,
 we
 don't


have
 confirmation
 if
 he's
 really


thinking
 of
 going
 public
 next
 year,
 but


in
 the
 new
 secondary
 sales
 for
 SpaceX,


valuing
 the
 company
 from
 around
 600
 to


800
 billion,
 specifically
 is
 pitching


data
 centers
 in
 space
 as
 part
 of
 the


thesis
 for
 why
 the
 company
 should
 get
 a


premium
 valuation.
 Now,
 maybe
 Bloomberg


is
 wrong
 about
 this,
 but
 you
 know,
 you


had
 Elon
 literally
 tweeting
 about
 data


centers
 in
 space
 last
 night.
 If
 they're


not
 wrong
 about
 this,
 look
 at
 SoFi
 up
 2%


27.40.
 Then
 Elon's
 taking
 this
 very


seriously.
 And
 uh
 that
 is
 a
 big
 deal.


BMR
 back
 above
 40
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in


a
 month.
 Look
 at
 her.
 That
 is
 beautiful.


Back
 above
 40.
 This
 thing
 fell
 all
 the


way
 to
 24.
 Ethereum
 did
 hit
 3,400.
 And


then
 we
 had
 BTC
 at
 92,800
 trying
 to
 get


to
 93,000.
 Now,
 why
 is
 Bitcoin
 and


Ethereum
 running?
 Well,
 the
 biggest


story
 of
 the
 day
 from
 this
 Federal


Reserve
 meeting
 is
 that
 the
 Fed
 says


they
 will
 begin
 buying
 Treasury
 bills
 on


December
 12th,
 which
 is
 two
 days
 away.


How
 much
 are
 they
 going to
 start
 buying?


Remember,
 they
 have
 been
 selling
 bonds


off
 the
 balance
 sheet
 since
 2022,
 aka


quantitative
 tightening.
 um
 QT
 and


unfortunately
 JPOW
 has
 not
 really
 been
 a


QT
 to
 me
 while
 he's
 been
 engaging
 in
 QT


but
 he's
 much
 more
 of
 a
 QT
 when
 he


starts
 QE
 40
 billion
 of
 Treasury
 bills


over
 the
 next
 30
 days
 liquidity
 is


entering
 into
 the
 system
 and
 that
 is


going
 to
 be
 very
 very
 important


ultimately
 for
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum
 and


a
 lot
 of the
 risk
 on
 assets.
 For
 those


that
 have
 been
 waiting
 for
 QE
 over
 the


past
 couple
 years,
 now
 we
 have
 had
 a


bull
 market
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 years.


Thank
 you
 to
 Nvidia.
 Thank
 you
 to
 AI.


But
 we
 weren't
 supposed
 to.
 And
 really


AI
 is
 what
 saved
 it.
 And
 in
 2022,
 we


didn't
 have
 that
 bull
 market
 primarily


because
 of
 rising
 interest
 rates
 and


quantitative
 tightening.
 That's
 gone.


Interest
 rates
 are
 not
 rising.
 They're


not
 necessarily
 coming
 down


dramatically.
 We
 got
 our
 25,
 but
 they're


not
 rising.
 and
 mortgages
 and
 bonds
 and


the
 the
 host
 of
 different
 baskets
 of


bonds
 that
 the
 Fed
 is
 going to
 be
 buying


is
 finally
 coming
 back
 into
 the


ecosystem
 after
 three
 years
 of
 the
 Fed


not
 buying.
 Here's
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of


an
 update
 on
 this
 Fed
 decision
 and
 then


we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> Though,
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 some
 pretty


big
 news
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 balance


sheet.
 The
 committee
 making
 a


determination.
 It
 is
 now
 at
 what
 it


calls
 an
 ample
 level
 of
 reserves.
 So,
 it


plans
 to
 initiate
 purchases
 of


shorter-term
 treasuries
 on
 an
 ongoing


basis.
 And
 then
 a
 separate
 document
 was


specific,
 saying
 the
 Fed
 will
 begin


buying
 $40
 billion
 in
 bills
 starting


December
 12th.
 That's
 just
 a
 couple
 days


from
 now,
 and
 I
 believe
 that's
 sooner


than
 the
 market
 expected.
 And
 those


purchases
 will
 go
 on
 for
 a
 little
 while


at
 an
 elevated
 level
 because
 of
 seasonal


demands
 for
 reserves
 that
 are
 out
 there


before
 coming
 down
 again
 in
 April.


That's
 what
 the
 document
 says.
 Outlook


on
 the
 economy
 in
 the
 statement.
 GDP


outlook
 was
 stronger
 next
 year
 in
 the


Fed's
 own
 forecast,
 up
 a
 half
 a
 point
 to


2.4%.
 So
 pretty
 big
 move
 there
 in
 the


outlook
 for
 GDP
 next
 year.
 The
 inflation


outlook
 lower
 for
 next
 year
 by
 just
 a


tick
 down
 to
 2
 and
 a
 half%
 just
 about


hitting
 the
 the
 target
 of
 2.1
 in
 2027.


The
 statement
 says
 the
 economy
 is


expanding
 at
 a
 moderate
 pace.


>> So
 there
 you
 go.
 QE
 is
 back.
 Um,
 and
 we


have
 cut
 rates.
 The
 rate
 cut
 was
 not
 the


big
 surprise,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 the


market
 expected
 40
 billion
 over
 the
 next


30
 days,
 especially
 at
 the
 rate
 uh
 or
 at


at
 the
 timing
 that
 they
 were
 going
 to


start,
 which
 is in
 two
 days,
 December


12th,
 but
 it
 looks
 like
 the
 Fed
 is


officially
 getting
 ready
 to
 inject
 that


liquidity
 into
 the
 system.
 93,000
 on


Bitcoin.
 S&P,
 you
 have
 a
 move.
 Again,


when
 JPEL
 speaks,
 we'll
 have
 a
 much


better
 understanding
 of
 what
 that
 move


looks
 like.

 Pounder

 there


at

 Bouncer
 did
 break

 yesterday
 in
 the

Maybe
 it
 is
 a
 shot
 to
 get
 there
 again.


Amazon
 230.
 I
 think
 that
 hit
 231
 this


morning.
 Uber's
 down.
 We'll
 talk
 about


that
 in
 a
 second.
 Again,
 Carvana
 is
 up


1.3%.
 Ironically,
 Nvidia
 not
 doing


anything.


Not
 doing
 anything.
 I
 mean,
 it
 just
 goes


to
 show
 how
 annoyed
 the
 market
 is
 or
 how


uh
 fearful
 the
 market
 is
 of
 this
 AI


narrative,
 but
 you're
 getting
 really


nothing.
 I
 mean,
 I
 guess
 182
 to
 18340
 is


is
 is
 your
 move.
 182
 is
 the
 lowest
 of


the
 days
 low
 of
 the
 day
 but
 that
 one


right
 now
 still
 down


about
 1%
 right
 now


and
 that
 is
 what
 we
 are
 seeing
 quite


incredible
 uh
 in
 this
 ecosystem
 of
 how


the
 market
 is
 thinking
 of
 the
 current


state
 of
 what
 the
 Fed
 is
 doing.
 Now
 the


other
 really
 interesting
 thing
 is
 again


you
 had
 nine
 votes
 for
 uh
 a
 rate
 cut
 but


you
 also
 had
 two
 votes
 against
 cutting


and
 then
 one
 which
 was
 for
 cutting
 by
 50


bips.
 So
 you
 had
 Moran
 who
 was
 way
 more


bullish
 than
 what
 we
 did.
 I
 mean
 well
 he


said
 he
 was
 going
 to
 you
 know
 vote
 for


50
 bips
 but
 he
 actually
 ended
 up
 voting


for
 it.
 I
 guess
 he
 thought
 there
 was
 an


overwhelming
 support
 of
 25
 bips.
 So
 he


wanted
 to
 show
 that
 he
 was
 extra


doubbish.
 And
 you
 had
 two
 that
 actually


said
 we
 shouldn't
 be
 cutting.
 Again
 the


Fed
 says
 it
 will
 buy
 40
 billion
 of


treasury
 bills
 over
 the
 next
 30
 days.


Fed
 cuts
 the
 benchmark
 rate
 target
 range


to
 3.5
 to
 3.75%
 93
 vote
 and
 they
 will


begin
 Treasury
 bill
 purchases
 starting


on
 December
 12th.
 For
 those
 that
 are


just
 joining,
 yes,
 we
 officially
 got
 a


cut
 and
 that's
 why
 markets
 are
 moving.


Now,
 if
 we
 could
 get,
 as
 Doug
 says
 right


here,
 Oracle,
 if
 we
 can
 get
 Oracle
 to


give
 us
 some
 love,
 Robin
 right
 there
 at


137
 and
 I'll
 be
 live
 for
 Oracle.
 We'll


just
 transition
 from
 the
 FOMC
 into
 the


uh
 the
 market
 close.
 Um,
 if
 Oracle
 can


blow
 away
 earnings,
 give
 us
 some
 decent


guidance.
 Ethereum
 back
 at
 3,400,
 S&P


685,


that
 might
 be
 the
 recipe
 we
 need
 to
 have


a
 really
 strong
 day
 and
 maybe
 start
 off


this
 potential
 December
 run.
 But
 it
 also


depends
 on
 what
 JPL
 is
 going to
 say.


TSM,
 that's
 moving.
 That's
 up

 Amazon

 Uh,
 even

today.

Nebius,
 I
 think,
 is
 still

 well.


No,
 Nebius
 went
 green

 after
 being


down
 all

 And
 then
 Cororeweave
 right


here,

 That
 one
 is

Wow.
 Rocket

 I
 mean,
 that's
 making


the
 big

 right
 here.

 goodness.

 I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 it's


not
 at
 the
 75
 highs
 that
 it
 was
 at
 um
 in


November
 or
 in
 October,
 but
 I
 mean,
 it


cracks
 through
 60,
 they're
 going
 to


start
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 to
 think


that
 it
 can
 make
 that
 run.
 Here
 is
 the


um
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 quotes
 by
 the


B
 Jeff
 Bezos
 and
 Elon
 Musk
 race
 to
 bring


data
 centers
 to
 space.
 Bezos
 Space


Center
 Blue
 Origin
 has
 a
 team
 working
 on


orbital
 data
 centers
 and
 Musk
 SpaceX
 has


pitched
 data
 center
 plan
 as
 part
 of


share
 sale
 and
 that's
 what's
 getting
 the


market
 a
 lot
 more
 excited
 right
 here.
 VG


at
 602
 pounder
 again
 at
 190.
 Yes,
 JPEL


will
 be
 live
 in
 about
 12
 minutes.
 We
 did


have
 our
 boy
 Tom
 Lee
 who
 was
 live
 about


an
 hour
 ago.
 Let
 me
 pull
 that
 up
 for


those
 that
 did
 not
 see
 it
 and
 we'll
 get


his
 take
 on
 what's
 happening.
 Now,
 he


predicted
 a
 rally
 and
 the
 reason
 he


predicted
 a
 rally
 primarily
 was
 based
 on


the
 idea
 that
 uh
 people
 were
 being
 too


bearish
 expecting
 a
 hawkish
 cut,
 which


is
 what
 we
 got.
 I
 mean,
 they're
 saying


no
 rate
 cuts
 in.
 They're
 saying
 one
 cut


in
 26,
 one
 cut
 in
 2027.
 You
 know,


there's
 no
 way
 in
 hell
 Trump
 is
 going
 to


allow
 one
 cut
 in
 2026.
 I
 mean,
 he
 is


going
 to
 fight
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 get


interest
 rates
 down
 to
 at least
 3%
 next


year,
 which
 would
 quantify
 to
 at least


three
 cuts.
 But
 this
 is
 a
 hawkish
 cut


and
 JPA's
 probably
 going
 to
 qualify
 it


being
 hawkish
 when
 he
 talks,
 but
 the


market's
 still
 being
 able
 to
 move


forward.


>> Exactly
 as
 Steve
 laid
 out,
 you
 know,
 Fed


does
 a
 cut,
 but
 future
 cuts
 are


uncertain,
 not
 even
 maybe
 until
 June.


Now,
 because
 that's
 the
 base
 case,
 then


if
 that's
 what
 happens,
 of
 course,


markets
 have
 already
 been
 bracing
 for


that,
 you
 know,
 and
 and
 they've
 been


bracing
 over
 it
 since
 October.
 And
 of


course
 there's
 a
 chance
 that
 it's
 a


dovish
 cut
 which
 would
 be
 bullish
 as


well.
 And
 then
 I
 think


>> what
 would
 what
 to
 you
 would
 be
 a
 dovish


cut?
 So
 are
 there
 projections?
 Are
 there


dots
 dot?
 There
 is.
 So
 we'll
 know
 right


away
 if
 they
 come
 out
 and
 those


projections
 show
 that
 they're
 expecting


more
 rate
 cuts
 next
 year
 than
 you're


you're
 saying
 you
 we
 might
 only
 get
 one


more
 in
 the
 in
 the
 summer.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 it
 could
 also
 be


interpreted
 doubbishly
 if
 they
 start


acknowledging
 the
 balance
 of
 risks
 are


shifting
 so
 that
 they
 then
 markets
 can


realize
 the
 Fed
 is
 now
 acknowledging


there's
 some
 underlying
 fragility
 of
 the


economy
 and
 of
 course
 now
 QE
 is
 because


QT
 is
 ending
 it's
 essentially
 not
 QT


which
 is
 QE
 and
 there's
 you
 know
 of


course
 the
 chance
 that
 there's
 um


something
 positive
 the
 Fed
 has
 to
 say.


So,
 I
 think
 it
 is
 a
 hawkish
 cut,
 but


actually
 I
 think
 market
 reaction
 is


positive.


>> And
 I
 we're
 there's
 so
 much
 more
 you're


queuing
 up
 here
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 into.


But
 on
 a
 top
 level,
 why
 why
 isn't
 it
 a


bigger
 roadblock
 for
 markets?
 Tom,
 you


know,
 you
 could
 look
 at
 this
 and
 just


say,
 well,
 we're
 already
 basically
 at


all-time
 highs.
 Look
 at
 the
 Russells
 and


so
 forth.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 and
 Powell's


been
 known
 to
 not
 have
 a
 very
 favorable


reaction
 to
 his
 commentary
 and
 he's
 only


got
 a
 few
 meetings
 left,
 so
 maybe
 he's


even
 more
 hawkish
 than
 usual.
 I
 don't


know.
 um
 why
 don't
 you
 think
 that's
 a


bigger
 risk
 and
 whether
 it's
 I
 I'm
 not


just
 myopically
 even
 talking
 about
 this


afternoon
 but
 you
 know
 kind
 of
 setting


the
 tone
 into
 year
 end
 and
 then
 into


next
 year.


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 part
 of
 it
 is
 just


the
 markets
 now
 adjusted
 to
 the
 idea


that
 the
 Fed
 is
 institutionally
 slightly


hawkish.
 Now
 part
 of
 it
 may
 be
 because


uh
 that
 there
 could
 be
 undue
 pressure


coming
 from
 outside
 the
 Fed
 and
 the


institution
 wants
 to
 protect
 its


integrity
 and
 that
 comes
 across
 as


hawkish.
 Uh
 but
 that
 dynamic
 is


something
 the
 markets
 have
 been
 bracing


for
 and
 they've
 reacted
 negatively
 to
 it


like
 in
 October
 they
 did
 and
 so
 I
 think


because
 of
 that
 that's
 what
 people
 are


building
 into
 this
 December
 meeting


which
 is
 why
 it
 could
 be
 a
 surprise.


It's
 like
 when
 Apple
 always
 gives


cautious
 guidance.
 You
 just
 cut
 you
 the


stock.


>> I
 mean,
 he
 is
 right
 on
 that
 argument.
 It


is
 a
 it
 is
 in
 the
 context
 of
 guidance
 uh


for
 the
 future.
 Remember
 JPAL
 was


hawkish
 last
 time
 uh
 said
 don't
 expect
 a


December
 cut.
 We
 ended
 up
 getting
 a


December
 cut.
 It
 is
 December
 10th
 and
 we


got
 a
 cut
 rock
 lab
 right
 up
 9%.
 Maybe


that's
 the
 case
 for
 2026.
 Also,
 I
 mean


there's
 no
 world
 where
 the
 Fed
 can
 come


out
 and
 be
 like,
 "Yeah,
 everything's


fine.
 2026
 we're
 going to
 give
 you
 three


cuts."
 like
 that's
 just
 not,
 you
 know,


even
 companies
 don't
 come
 out
 and
 and


and
 raise
 guidance
 like
 that
 easily


because
 then
 there's
 nothing
 to
 to


surprise
 with.
 So,
 uh
 it
 makes
 sense


that
 they're
 not
 as
 doubbish,
 but
 the


market's
 not
 necessarily
 being
 as
 uh


annoyed
 or
 I
 guess
 as
 scared
 of
 them
 not


being
 that
 doubbish
 because
 the
 market


also
 probably
 knows
 that
 we're
 going
 to


get
 these
 cuts
 and
 JPAL
 is
 not
 going
 to


be
 the
 fed
 here.
 S&P
 500
 right
 there


684,
 Nvidia
 still
 not
 moving,
 really
 not


making
 a
 massive
 move.
 Palanteer
 and


Robin
 Hood
 up
 about
 1%.
 pounds
 are
 up
 4%


and
 then
 TSM
 at
 309.
 By
 the
 way,
 Trump


has
 officially
 started
 interviews
 with


the
 new
 Fed
 candidates.
 Kevin
 Worsh
 is


reportedly
 at
 the
 White
 House
 today


having
 interviews.
 Hassid
 is
 not
 a
 lock.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 concerns
 from
 the
 bond


market,
 which
 let's
 check
 the
 tenure


right
 now
 around
 um
 his
 independence
 and


you
 know
 if
 the
 bond
 market
 can
 trust


that
 Hasset's
 actually
 going
 to
 be
 able


to
 operate
 without
 allegiance
 to
 the


president.
 So
 I
 think
 Trump
 I
 mean


there's
 a
 world
 in
 which
 he
 doesn't
 pick


acid
 and
 he
 picks
 someone
 that
 the
 bond


market
 likes
 more
 but
 he's
 going
 to
 want


to
 really
 confirm
 that
 they
 are
 on
 the


side
 of
 cutting
 rates.
 4.16.
 So
 it's
 not


at
 4.2
 like
 it
 was
 in
 the
 morning
 which


is
 good.
 Um


but
 it
 is
 down
 a
 bit
 more.
 What
 are
 the


polyarket
 odds?
 So
 first
 of
 all
 let's


bring
 up
 Kshi.
 Jason
 was
 freaking


texting
 me
 like
 a
 degenerate
 and
 saying


that
 we
 have
 to
 bet
 on
 JPAL
 and
 all
 the


stuff
 he's
 going
 to
 say.
 So,
 these
 are


all
 the
 things
 you
 can


uh
 take
 a
 wager
 on
 here.
 Some
 of
 these


things
 are
 incredibly
 mispriced
 to
 me
 to


the
 upside.
 So,
 for
 example,
 and
 I
 don't


know,
 maybe
 I'll
 be
 wrong
 on
 this,
 but


like
 I
 don't
 think
 he's
 going
 to
 say


Trump.
 Trump
 is
 trading
 at
 15
 cents


right
 now.
 I
 I
 don't
 He
 doesn't
 like


acknowledging
 Trump.
 I
 I
 don't
 even


think
 he
 said
 Trump's
 name
 last
 time.


So,
 he
 doesn't
 even
 say
 President
 Trump


and
 stuff.
 So,
 every
 time
 he
 gets
 a


Trump
 question,
 he
 kind
 of
 avoids
 it.
 I


think
 this
 I
 would
 take
 the
 under
 on


this.
 Um
 soft
 landing
 we
 haven't
 heard


in
 a
 long
 time.
 That
 was
 like
 2024
 2023


stuff.
 I
 don't
 think
 he's
 going
 to
 say


soft
 landing.
 Stablecoin
 maybe
 if
 he


talks
 about
 crypto.
 Uh
 QE
 he's
 probably


going
 to
 mention.
 Uh
 beigebook
 he


probably
 will
 mention.
 AI
 probably
 has


to
 mention
 shutdown
 layoffs.
 He'll


mention
 restrictive
 he'll
 mention.
 Look


at
 this
 one.
 Good
 where
 is
 it?


Afternoon.
 Is
 that
 the
 one?


I
 think
 good
 afternoon
 was
 up
 there


trading
 at
 like
 50
 cents.
 I'm
 like,


"Bro,
 what
 if
 he
 doesn't
 say
 good


afternoon?"
 Like,
 what
 what
 if
 what
 if


he
 has
 a
 different
 way
 of
 greeting


everybody?


Uh,
 let
 me
 see
 if
 it's
 still
 up
 there.


Yeah,
 there
 it
 is.
 And
 96%.


Bro,
 what
 if
 he
 just
 says
 something


different
 than
 good
 after?
 What
 if
 he


says
 hello
 everybody
 or
 something
 like


that?
 I
 mean,
 then
 you
 just
 lost
 90
 98


cents
 on
 the
 dollar
 or
 95
 cents
 on
 the


dollar
 at
 that
 point.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know.


I
 don't
 know if
 I
 would
 like
 really
 bet


that
 much
 money
 that
 that
 would
 play


out.
 So,
 is
 data
 dependent
 on
 the
 list?


It
 should
 be
 data.
 No,
 data
 dependent
 is


not
 on
 the
 list,
 but
 that
 one
 should
 be


since
 I'll
 probably
 say
 that.
 Look
 at


this.
 Look
 at
 all
 these
 comments
 of


people
 betting
 on
 what
 he's
 going
 to


say.
 This
 is
 the
 world
 we
 live
 in,
 bro.


How
 much
 volume
 is
 in
 this
 thing
 right


now?
 1.5
 million
 of
 volume.
 Look
 at
 all


these
 $1
 bets
 coming
 in
 in
 real
 time.


This
 is
 wild.
 Someone
 just
 bet
 $750,


$800,
 $300.


This
 is
 crazy.
 Absolutely
 crazy.
 Let's


finish
 up
 with
 uh
 with
 Tom
 Lee
 right


here
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from


there.


>> Crypto
 asset
 or
 or
 buy
 stocks
 because


this
 is
 coming.
 So
 it's
 important
 to


know
 whether
 it's
 coming
 or
 not


>> comes
 from
 the
 banks.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 yeah,
 in
 the
 crypto
 world
 QT
 was


draining
 liquidity.
 So
 the
 ending
 of
 QT


is
 essentially
 QE
 because
 if
 they're


just
 holding
 the
 balance
 sheet
 flat,


they
 are
 still
 going
 to
 be
 essentially


adding
 liquidity
 to
 the
 system


>> to
 maintain
 the
 size.
 Yes.
 And
 so
 that


is
 why
 I
 think
 crypto
 prices
 have
 risen


in
 anticipation
 of
 this
 meeting.


>> So
 do
 crypto
 prices
 keep
 going?
 Do
 you


have
 a
 bullish
 view
 still
 on
 small
 caps


if
 we're
 finally
 going
 to
 get
 that
 rate


coming
 down
 a
 little
 bit?
 Where
 should


people
 look
 for
 alpha
 or
 outperformance?


>> Um
 yeah,
 I
 mean
 like
 2026


is
 a
 year
 like
 there's
 a
 new
 Fed,
 right?


and
 but
 a
 dovish
 tilt
 and
 at
 a
 time
 when


the
 ISM's
 been
 below
 50
 for
 a
 record


more
 than
 three
 years.
 So
 that's
 really


good
 for
 small
 caps
 and
 as
 Barry
 says
 if


they
 deregulate
 banking
 and
 we
 were


talking
 about
 this
 uh
 offline
 that's


really
 good
 for
 small
 caps
 but
 that's


also
 really
 good
 for
 the
 business
 cycle


and
 we
 we've
 talked
 about
 this
 in
 some


of
 our
 past
 research.
 Crypto
 prices
 are


really
 sensitive
 to
 the
 ISM.
 So
 the
 ISM


moving
 back
 above
 50
 has
 historically


been
 associated
 with
 actually
 super


cycle
 moves
 in
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum.


>> Wait,
 ISM
 going
 into
 expansion
 territory


is
 positive
 for
 Bitcoin
 and
 correct.


Interesting.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 if
 you
 look
 at
 ISM
 and


Bitcoin


uh
 and
 you
 drend
 Bitcoin
 essentially


look
 at
 its
 distance
 from
 the
 200
 day.


It's
 almost
 perfectly
 correlated
 to
 the


ISM.


>> Surprising.


>> And
 same
 thing
 with
 copper
 to
 gold


prices.
 So
 copper
 is
 an
 industrial
 metal


versus
 gold
 is


>> right.
 But
 all
 of
 that
 tells
 you
 that


it's
 basically
 just
 risk
 on
 that
 they're


all
 behaving
 like
 an
 economy.
 And
 is


that
 am
 I
 over
 characterizing?


>> I
 think
 that's
 I
 think
 that's
 right.
 I


think
 Bitcoin's
 a
 bit
 of a
 chameleon


because
 they're
 there'll
 probably
 be
 a


time
 when
 it
 it
 acts
 like
 uh
 gold,
 but


right
 now
 it
 acts
 a
 lot
 more
 like
 it's


sensitive
 to
 monetary
 policy
 and
 the


business
 cycle
 and
 both
 are
 about
 to


turn
 up.
 So
 that
 would
 mean
 anybody
 who


thinks
 the
 Bitcoin
 four-year
 cycle
 means


crypto
 prices
 are
 down
 next
 year.
 We're


betting
 against
 that
 thinking
 that
 new


highs
 come
 early


>> like
 January


>> as
 a
 fin.


>> Okay,
 three
 minutes.
 Three
 minutes.
 Here


we
 go.
 Again,
 this
 is
 the
 reason
 why
 we


invest.
 None
 of
 your
 friends
 or
 family


or
 anyone
 you
 care
 about
 probably
 knows


that
 JPL
 is
 uh
 speaking
 in
 the
 next


three
 minutes.
 But
 all
 of
 us
 are
 going


to
 be
 obsessed
 with
 every
 single


syllable
 that
 he
 says.
 I'm
 not
 saying


it's
 healthy.
 Never
 said
 it
 was
 healthy.


never
 even
 said
 it
 was
 productive.
 Quite


frankly,
 it's
 like
 a
 form
 of


entertainment.
 It's
 not
 even
 market


research,
 but
 it's
 our
 form
 of


entertainment.
 It
 is
 our
 form
 of


entertainment.
 68363
 0.08%
 on
 the
 S&P.


So,
 basically
 that
 move
 we
 had
 on
 the


S&P
 pretty
 much
 went
 erased.
 Nvidia
 goes


down.
 Hood
 goes
 down
 again.
 That's
 why


those
 green
 candles
 as
 as
 amazing
 as
 the


dopamine
 is.
 Same
 thing
 with
 Rock
 Lab
 59


to
 57.
 You
 just
 can't
 trust
 it
 because


ultimately
 the
 price
 action
 starts
 I


believe
 at
 3:30.
 30
 minutes
 before
 the


market
 closes.
 That's
 when
 we
 really
 get


to
 see
 how
 the
 market's
 interpreting


this
 stuff
 and
 whatever
 happens
 in


between
 is
 just
 the
 action
 that
 happens


in
 between.


Here
 we
 go.
 Okay,
 let
 me
 do
 one
 pump
 or


dump
 poll
 in
 the
 chat.
 So,
 this
 is
 a


general
 pumper
 dump
 poll
 I
 guess
 during


the
 FOMC
 meeting.
 I
 mean,
 the
 initial


reaction
 was
 a
 pump.
 It's
 just
 is
 that


the
 last
 is
 the
 question.
 And
 how


hawkish
 or
 potentially
 doubbish


does
 JPAL
 go


during
 FOMC


to
 make
 this
 actually
 happen?


All right,
 here
 we
 go.
 Here
 we
 go.
 It's


exciting
 stuff,
 dude.
 This
 is
 exciting.


Oh,
 real
 quick.
 Whimo.
 So,
 updates
 on


Whimo.
 We
 got
 two
 minutes
 until
 we
 go


live.
 Dude,
 Whimo
 is
 crushing
 it.
 14


million
 paid
 rides
 in
 2025.
 On
 track
 for


20
 million
 lifetime
 rides
 in
 2025,


they're
 doing
 a
 million
 rides
 a
 month.


They're
 targeting
 a
 million
 rides
 per


week
 in
 2026.
 20
 new
 cities
 planned
 for


2026,
 including
 Tokyo
 and
 London.
 I
 was


wondering
 why
 Uber
 was
 down
 5%
 on
 the


day.
 It's
 because
 of
 this.
 It's
 because


of
 this.
 The
 entire
 market
 is
 wondering


if
 a
 business
 model
 for
 Uber
 can
 exist


if
 you
 have
 Whimo
 with
 this
 type.
 I


mean,
 this
 is
 tripledigit
 growth


year-over-year.
 And
 you
 know,
 Tesla's


going to
 get
 into
 the
 mix
 pretty
 soon,


and
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 very
 exciting


for
 the
 robo
 taxi
 res
 revolution.
 So,


we're
 going to
 see
 how
 this
 all
 plays


out.
 But
 that
 was
 the
 update
 on
 Google.


And
 that's
 why
 Uber
 ended
 up
 going
 down


about
 5%
 on
 the
 day.


All right,
 we
 got
 one
 minute.
 One


minute.


JPAL's
 not
 live
 yet.
 I
 will
 switch
 as


soon
 as
 he's
 live.


And
 then
 we're
 going
 to
 see.


We're
 going
 to
 see.
 I'm
 curious
 if
 he


actually
 says
 good
 afternoon.
 I
 am


curious
 if
 he
 actually
 says
 good


afternoon


or
 uh


or
 or
 if
 it's
 just
 something
 so
 many


bets
 during
 this
 entire


entire
 meeting
 based
 on
 what
 JPL
 ends
 up


saying
 here.
 All
 right,
 so
 he
 should
 be


coming
 live
 in
 about
 10
 15
 seconds


and
 then
 we
 get
 to
 stare
 at
 him.
 Also,


purple
 tie
 or
 not?
 What
 do
 you
 guys


think?
 Do
 we
 I
 think
 we
 got
 the
 purple


tie
 last
 time.


Do
 you
 think
 we
 get
 the
 purple
 tie


again?


Of
 course,
 my
 mic
 goes
 out.
 Of
 course.


Okay.
 Well,
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 leave
 it


here
 and
 then
 it'll
 go
 live.
 Of
 course,


my
 mic
 is
 going
 bad
 right
 before
 we
 go


live.


Green
 tie.
 All right.
 Here
 he
 is.


>> There
 is
 Jerome
 Powell.
 Let's
 listen


into
 the
 Fed
 chair.


Good
 afternoon.


My
 colleagues
 and
 I
 remain
 squarely


focused
 on
 achieving
 our
 dual
 mandate


goals
 of
 maximum
 employment
 and
 stable


prices
 for
 the
 benefit
 of
 the
 American


people.


Although
 important
 federal
 government


data
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 months
 have


yet
 to
 be
 released,
 available
 public
 and


private
 sector
 data
 suggests
 that
 the


outlook
 for
 employment
 and
 inflation
 has


not
 changed
 as
 much
 since
 our
 meeting
 in


October.
 Conditions
 in
 the
 labor
 market


appear
 to
 be
 gradually
 cooling
 and


inflation
 remains
 somewhat
 elevated.


In
 support
 of
 our
 goals,
 in
 light
 of
 the


balance
 of
 risks
 to
 employment
 and


inflation,
 today
 the
 Federal
 Open
 Market


Committee
 decided
 to
 lower
 our
 policy


interest
 rate
 by
 a
 quarter
 percentage


point.
 As
 a
 separate
 matter,
 we
 also


decided
 to
 initiate
 purchases
 of


shorterterm
 Treasury
 securities
 solely


for
 the
 purpose
 of
 maintaining
 an
 ample


supply
 of
 reserves
 over
 time,
 thus


supporting
 effective
 control
 of
 our


policy
 rate.


I
 will
 have
 more
 to
 say
 about
 monetary


policy
 and
 its
 implementation
 after


briefly
 reviewing
 economic
 developments.


Although
 some
 key
 government
 data
 have


yet
 to
 be
 released,
 available
 indicators


suggest
 that
 economic
 activity
 has
 been


expanding
 at
 a
 moderate
 pace.
 Consumer


spending
 appears
 to
 have
 remained
 solid


and
 business
 fixed
 investment
 has


continued
 to
 expand.


In
 contrast,
 activity
 in
 the
 housing


sector
 remains
 weak.


The
 temporary
 shutdown
 of
 the
 federal


government
 has
 likely
 weighed
 on


economic
 activity
 in
 the
 current


quarter,
 but
 these
 effects
 should
 be


mostly
 offset
 by
 higher
 growth
 next


quarter,
 reflecting
 the
 reopening.


In
 our
 summary
 of
 economic
 projections,


the
 median
 participant
 projects
 that


real
 GDP
 will
 rise
 1.7%
 this
 year
 and


2.3%
 next
 year,
 somewhat
 stronger
 than


projected
 in
 September.


In
 the
 labor
 market,
 although
 official


employment
 data
 for
 October
 and
 November


are
 delayed,


available
 evidence
 suggests
 that
 both


layoffs
 and
 hiring
 remain
 low
 and
 that


both
 households
 perceptions
 of
 job


availability
 and
 firms
 possession


perceptions
 of
 hiring
 difficulty


continued
 to
 decline.


The
 official
 report
 on
 the
 labor
 market


for
 September,
 the
 most
 recent
 release,


showed
 that
 the
 unemployment
 rate


continued
 to
 edge
 up,
 reaching
 4.4%
 4%


and
 that
 job
 gains
 had
 slowed


significantly
 since
 earlier
 in
 the
 year.


A
 good
 part
 of
 the
 slowing
 likely


reflects
 a
 decline
 in
 the
 growth
 of
 the


labor
 force
 due
 to
 lower
 immigration
 and


labor
 force
 participation.


Though
 labor
 demand
 has
 clearly
 softened


as
 well.


In
 this
 less
 dynamic
 and
 somewhat
 softer


labor
 market,
 the
 downside
 risks
 to


employment
 appear
 to
 have
 risen
 in


recent
 months.
 In
 our
 SEP,
 the
 median


projection
 of
 the
 unemployment
 rate
 is


4.5%
 at
 the
 end
 of
 this
 year
 and
 edges


down
 thereafter.


Inflation
 has
 eased
 significantly
 from


its
 highs
 in
 mid
 2022,
 but
 remains


somewhat
 elevated
 relative
 to
 our
 2%


longerrun
 goal.


Very
 little
 data
 on
 inflation
 have
 been


released
 since
 our
 meeting
 in
 October.


Total
 PCE
 prices
 rose
 2.8%
 8%
 over
 the


12
 months
 ending
 in
 September.
 And


excluding
 the
 volatile
 food
 and
 energy


categories,
 core
 PCE
 prices
 also
 rose


2.8%.


These
 readings
 are
 higher
 than
 earlier


in
 the
 year
 as
 inflation
 for
 goods
 has


picked
 up,
 reflecting
 the
 effects
 of


tariffs.


In
 contrast,
 disinflation
 appears
 to
 be


continuing
 for
 services.


Near-term
 measures
 of
 inflation


expectations
 have
 declined
 from
 their


peaks
 earlier
 in
 the
 year
 as
 reflected


in
 both
 market
 and
 survey
 based


measures.


Most
 measures
 of
 longerterm
 expectations


remain
 consistent
 with
 our
 2%
 inflation


goal.


The
 median
 projection
 in
 the
 SCP
 for


total
 PCE
 inflation
 is
 2.9%
 this
 year


and
 2.4%
 next
 year,
 a
 bit
 lower
 than
 the


median
 projection
 in
 September.


Thereafter,
 the
 median
 falls
 to
 2%.
 Our


monetary
 policy
 actions
 are
 guided
 by


our
 dual
 mandate
 to
 promote
 maximum


employment
 and
 stable
 prices
 for
 the


American
 people.
 At
 today's
 meeting,
 the


committee
 decided
 to
 lower
 the
 target


range
 for
 the
 federal
 funds
 rate
 by
 a


quarter
 percentage
 point
 to
 3
 and
 1 half


to
 3
 and
 3/4%.


In
 the
 near
 term,
 risks
 to
 inflation
 are


tilted
 to
 the
 upside
 and
 risks
 risks
 to


employment
 to
 the
 downside,
 a


challenging
 situation.


There
 is
 no
 risk-free
 path
 for
 policy
 as


we
 navigate
 this
 tension
 between
 our


employment
 and
 inflation
 goals.


A
 reasonable
 base
 case
 is
 that
 the


effects
 of
 tariffs
 on
 inflation
 will
 be


relatively
 short-lived,
 effectively
 a


one-time
 shift
 in
 the
 price
 level.
 Our


obligation
 is
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 a


one-time
 increase
 in
 the
 price
 level


does
 not
 become
 an
 ongoing
 inflation


problem.


But
 with
 downside
 risks
 to
 employment


having
 risen
 in
 recent
 months,
 the


balance
 of
 risks
 has
 shifted.
 Our


framework
 calls
 for
 us
 to
 take
 a


balanced
 approach
 in
 promoting
 both


sides
 of
 our
 dual
 mandate.
 Accordingly,


we
 judged
 it
 appropriate
 at
 this
 meeting


to
 lower
 our
 policy
 rate
 by
 a
 quarter


percentage
 point.


With
 today's
 decision,
 we
 have
 lowered


our
 policy
 rate
 threequarters
 of
 a


percentage
 point
 over
 our
 last
 three


meetings.
 This
 further
 normalization
 of


our
 policy
 stance
 should
 help
 stabilize


the
 labor
 market
 while
 allowing


inflation
 to
 resume
 its
 downward
 trend


toward
 2%
 once
 the
 effects
 of
 tariffs


have
 passed
 through.


The
 adjustments
 to
 our
 policy
 stance


since
 September
 bring
 it
 within
 a
 range


of
 plausible
 plausible
 estimates
 of


neutral
 and
 leave
 us
 well
 positioned
 to


determine
 the
 extent
 and
 timing
 of


additional
 adjustments
 to
 our
 policy


rate
 based
 on
 the
 incoming
 data,
 the


evolving
 outlook
 and
 the
 balance
 of


risks.


In
 our
 summary
 of
 economic
 projections,


FOMC
 participants
 wrote
 down
 their


individual
 assessments
 of
 an
 appropriate


path
 of
 the
 federal
 funds
 rate
 under


what
 each
 participant
 judges
 to
 be
 the


most
 likely
 scenario
 for
 the
 economy.


The
 median
 participant
 projects
 that
 the


appropriate
 level
 of
 the
 federal
 funds


rate
 will
 be
 3.4%
 at
 the
 end
 of
 2026
 and


3.1%
 at
 the
 end
 of
 2027,
 unchanged
 from


September.


As
 is
 always
 the
 case,
 these
 individual


forecasts
 are
 subject
 to
 uncertainty
 and


they're
 not
 a
 committee
 plan
 or


decision.
 Monetary
 policy
 is
 not
 on
 a


preset
 course
 and
 we
 will
 make
 our


decisions
 on
 a
 meeting
 bymeating
 basis.


Let
 me
 turn
 now
 to
 issues
 related
 to
 the


implementation
 of
 monetary
 policy.
 with


the
 reminder
 that
 these
 issues
 are


separate
 from
 and
 have
 no
 implications


for
 the
 stance
 of
 monetary
 policy.


In
 light
 of
 the
 continued
 tightening
 in


money
 market
 interest
 rates
 relative
 to


our
 administered
 rates
 and
 other


indicators
 of
 reserve
 market
 conditions,


the
 committee
 judged
 that
 reserve


balances
 have
 declined
 to
 ample
 levels.


Accordingly,
 at
 today's
 meeting,
 the


committee
 decided
 to
 initiate
 purchases


of
 shorter
 term,
 mainly
 treasury
 bills


for
 the
 sole
 purpose
 of
 maintaining
 an


ample
 supply
 of
 reserves
 over
 time.
 Such


increases
 in
 our
 securities
 holdings


ensure
 that
 the
 federal
 funds
 rate


remains
 within
 its
 target
 range
 and
 are


necessary
 because
 the
 growth
 of
 the


economy
 leads
 to
 rising
 demand
 over
 time


for
 our
 liabilities,
 including
 currency


and
 reserves.


As
 detailed
 in
 a
 statement
 released


today
 by
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 Bank
 of
 New


York,
 reserve
 management
 purchases
 will


amount
 to
 $40
 billion
 in
 the
 first
 month


and
 may
 remain
 elevated
 for
 a
 few
 months


to
 alleviate
 expected
 near-term


pressures
 in
 money
 markets.
 Thereafter,


we
 expect
 the
 size
 of
 reser
 reserve


management
 purchases
 to
 decline,
 though


the
 actual
 pace
 will
 depend
 on
 market


conditions.


In
 our
 implementation
 framework,
 an


ample
 supply
 of
 reserves
 means
 that
 the


federal
 funds
 rate
 and
 other
 short-term


interest
 rates
 are
 primarily
 controlled


by
 the
 setting
 of
 our
 administered
 rates


rather
 than
 day-to-day
 discretionary


interventions
 in
 money
 markets.
 In
 this


regime,
 standing
 repurchase
 agreement
 or


repo
 operations
 are
 a
 critical
 tool
 to


ensure
 that
 the
 federal
 funds
 rate


remains
 within
 its
 target
 range
 even
 on


days
 of
 elevated
 pressures
 in
 money


markets.
 Consistent
 with
 this
 view,
 the


committee
 eliminated
 the
 aggregate
 limit


on
 standing
 repo
 operations.
 These


operations
 are
 intended
 to
 support


monetary
 policy
 implementation
 and


smooth
 market
 functioning
 and
 should
 be


used
 when
 economically
 sensible.


To
 conclude,
 the
 Fed
 has
 been
 assigned


two
 goals
 for
 monetary
 policy,
 maximum


employment
 and
 stable
 prices.
 We
 remain


committed
 to
 supporting
 maximum


employment,
 bringing
 our
 inflation


sustainably
 down
 to
 our
 2%
 goal,
 and


keeping
 longerterm
 inflation


expectations
 well
 anchored.
 Our
 success


in
 delivering
 on
 these
 goals
 matters
 to


all
 Americans.
 We
 understand
 that
 our


actions
 affect
 communities,
 families,


and
 businesses
 across
 the
 country.


Everything
 we
 do
 is
 in
 service
 to
 our


public
 mission.
 At
 the
 Fed,
 we
 will
 do


everything
 we
 can
 to
 achieve
 our
 maximum


employment
 and
 price
 stability
 goals.


Thank
 you
 and
 I
 look
 forward
 to
 your


questions.


>> All
 right,
 Q&A.
 This
 is
 where
 we
 really


see
 some
 action.


>> Uh
 thank
 you
 Howard
 Schneider
 with


Reuters.
 Uh
 just
 first
 turning
 to
 the


statement
 the
 just
 to
 be
 clear,
 we're
 on


the
 same
 page
 here,
 the
 insertion
 of
 the


phrase
 uh
 considering
 the
 extended


timing
 of
 additional
 adjustments.
 Does


that
 indicate
 that
 the
 Fed
 is
 now
 on


hold
 until
 there's
 some
 clearer
 signal


from
 uh
 inflation
 or
 jobs
 or
 the


evolution
 of
 the
 economy
 along
 the


baseline
 outlook?


So
 yes,
 the
 um
 the
 adjustments
 since


September
 um
 bring
 our
 policy
 within
 a


broad
 range
 of
 estimates
 of
 neutral
 and


as
 we
 noted
 in
 our
 statement
 today,
 we


are
 well
 positioned
 to
 determine
 the


extent
 and
 timing
 of
 additional


adjustments
 based
 on
 the
 incoming
 data,


the
 evolving
 outlook
 and
 the
 balance
 of


risks.
 Uh
 that
 new
 language
 points
 out


that
 we'll
 carefully
 evaluate
 that


incoming
 data.
 Uh
 and
 also
 I
 would
 note


that
 having
 reduced
 our
 policy
 rate
 by


75
 basis
 points
 since
 September
 and
 175


basis
 points
 since
 last
 September,
 the


Fed
 funds
 rate
 is
 now
 within
 a
 broad


range
 of
 estimates
 of
 its
 neutral
 value


and
 we
 are
 well
 positioned
 to
 wait
 to


see
 how
 the
 economy
 evolves.
 And
 if
 I


could
 follow
 up
 on
 the
 outlook
 there,
 it


it
 it
 seems
 like
 with
 the
 additional
 GDP


growth
 coupled
 with
 easing
 inflation
 and


a
 fairly
 steady
 unemployment
 rate,
 this


seems
 like
 a
 pretty
 optimistic
 outlook


uh
 for
 next
 year.
 Um
 what's
 given
 rise


to
 that?
 Is
 this
 an
 early
 bet
 on
 AI?
 Is


there
 some
 sense
 of
 uh
 improve
 improving


productivity
 out
 there?
 What's
 what's


driving
 that?


>> So
 a
 number
 of
 things
 are
 driving
 uh


what's
 happening
 in
 the
 forecast?
 And
 I


would
 say
 if
 you
 if
 you
 look
 broadly
 at


outside
 forecasts,
 you
 do
 see
 a
 pickup


in
 growth
 in
 many
 of
 those
 now
 too.
 So


it
 is
 um
 it's
 partly
 that
 consumer


spending
 has
 held
 up.
 It's
 been


resilient
 and
 it
 it
 to
 another
 degree
 it


is
 it
 is
 that
 uh
 AI
 spending
 on
 data


centers
 and
 related
 to
 AI
 has
 been


holding
 up
 business
 investment.
 So


overall
 um
 the
 the
 baseline
 expectation


for
 next
 year
 is
 at
 least
 at
 at
 the
 Fed


and
 I
 think
 with
 with
 outside


forecasters
 too
 is
 a
 pick
 up
 in
 growth


from
 today's
 relatively
 low
 level
 of


level
 of
 1.7%.
 I
 mentioned
 that
 the
 SEP


median
 is
 1.7
 for
 this
 year
 growth
 and


2.3
 for
 next
 year.
 You
 actually
 some
 of


that
 is
 due
 to
 the
 uh
 the
 shutdown.
 So


you
 can
 take
 2/10
 out
 of
 2026
 and
 put
 it


in
 2025.
 So
 it
 would
 really
 be
 1.9
 and


2.1.
 But
 overall,
 yes,
 um,
 you
 know,
 you


know,
 for
 a
 few
 reasons.
 Fiscal
 policy


is
 going
 to
 be
 supportive
 and
 as
 I


mentioned,
 AI
 spending
 will
 continue,


the
 consumer
 continues
 to
 spend.
 So
 it


looks
 like
 uh
 the
 baseline
 would
 be


solid
 growth
 next
 year.


>> Steve,


>> uh,
 thank
 you
 uh,
 Mr.
 chairman
 for


taking
 our
 questions
 here.
 Um
 the
 uh
 you


had
 previously
 described
 rate
 cuts
 in


terms
 of
 a
 riskmanagement
 framework
 and


kind
 of
 following
 up
 on
 what
 Howard
 was


asking
 um
 is
 the
 riskmanagement
 phase
 of


rate
 cuts
 over
 here
 and
 uh
 um
 have
 you


taken
 out
 sufficient
 uh
 insurance
 I


guess
 against
 potential
 weakness
 in


terms
 of
 the
 data
 we
 might
 get
 next
 week


when
 it
 comes
 to
 employment?
 So
 we're


going
 to
 get
 a
 great
 deal
 of
 data


between
 now
 and
 the
 and
 the
 January


meeting
 and
 I'm
 sure
 we'll
 talk
 more


about
 that
 and
 that
 will
 the
 data
 that


we
 get
 are
 going
 to
 factor
 into
 our


thinking
 but
 yes
 we
 have
 uh
 if
 if
 you
 go


back
 uh
 we
 held
 our
 policy
 rate
 at
 you


know
 5.4%
 for
 more
 than
 a
 year
 because


inflation
 was
 high
 very
 high
 and


unemployment
 when
 and
 the
 labor
 market


was
 was
 really
 solid
 at
 that
 point.
 So


what
 happened
 is
 over
 last
 summer,


summer
 of
 of of
 of
 24,
 um
 inflation
 came


down
 and
 the
 labor
 market
 began
 to
 show


real
 signs
 of
 weakness.
 And
 so
 we
 we


decided
 as
 our
 framework
 tells
 us
 to
 do


that,
 uh
 when
 the
 when
 the
 risks
 to
 the


two
 goals
 become
 more
 equal,
 you
 should


move
 from
 uh
 a
 stance
 that
 favors
 really


dealing
 with
 one
 of
 them,
 in
 that
 case


inflation,
 to
 a
 more
 balanced,
 more


neutral
 setting.
 And
 so
 we
 we
 we
 did


that.
 We
 did
 some
 cutting
 and
 then
 we
 we


paused
 for
 a
 while
 to
 work
 our
 way


through
 uh
 what
 was
 happening
 in
 the


middle
 of
 the
 year
 and
 then
 we
 resumed


cuts
 in
 in
 September
 and
 we've
 cut
 now


three
 we
 now
 cut
 a
 total
 of
 175
 basis


points
 and
 as
 I
 mentioned
 you
 know
 we


feel
 like
 uh
 where
 we're
 positioned
 now


puts
 we're
 well
 positioned
 to
 wait
 and


see
 how
 the
 economy
 evolves
 from
 here.


If
 I
 could
 just
 follow
 up
 on
 the
 SCP,
 um


you
 have
 a
 whole
 lot
 of
 a
 big
 increase


in
 the
 growth
 numbers
 but
 not
 a
 big


decline
 in
 the
 unemployment
 numbers
 and


is
 that
 an
 AI
 factor
 in
 there?
 What
 is


going
 on
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 dynamic
 of
 you


get
 more
 growth
 but
 you
 don't
 get
 a


whole
 lot
 of
 decline
 in
 unemployment?


Thank
 you
 sir.


>> So
 it
 it
 is
 the
 implication
 is
 obviously


higher
 productivity
 um
 and
 u
 some
 of


that
 may
 be
 AI.
 It
 just
 also
 I
 think
 uh


productivity
 has
 just
 been
 almost


structurally
 higher
 for
 several
 years


now.
 So
 if
 you
 start
 to
 thinking
 of
 it


as
 2%
 per
 year,
 you
 can
 sustain
 higher


growth
 without
 more
 without
 more
 job


creation.
 Uh
 of
 course
 higher


productivity
 is
 also
 what
 enables


incomes
 to
 rise
 over
 long
 periods
 of


time.
 So
 it's
 basically
 a
 good
 thing,


but
 that
 may
 be
 that's
 certainly
 the


implication.


>> Thank
 you.
 Kobe
 Smith
 with
 the
 New
 York


Times.
 Um
 today's
 decision
 was
 clearly


very
 divided.
 It
 wasn't
 just
 the
 two


official
 descents
 against
 the
 cut,
 but


there
 were
 also
 soft
 descents
 from
 four


uh
 others.
 And
 I'm
 just
 wondering
 if
 um


this
 reluctance
 from
 several
 people
 to


support
 recent
 reductions
 suggests
 that


there
 is
 a
 much
 higher
 bar
 for
 cuts
 in


the
 near
 term
 and
 and
 what
 exactly
 does


the
 committee
 need
 to
 see
 um
 if
 things


are
 well
 positioned
 right
 now
 um
 to


support
 a
 January
 reduction?


>> Sure.
 So
 um
 let
 me
 just
 say
 as
 I


mentioned
 u
 and
 as
 I've
 mentioned
 here


before
 the
 situation
 is
 is
 that
 our
 two


goals
 are
 a
 bit
 in
 tension
 right
 so
 um


interestingly
 everyone
 around
 the
 table


at
 the
 FOMC
 agrees
 that
 inflation
 is
 too


high
 and
 that
 we
 want
 it
 to
 come
 down


and
 agrees
 that
 the
 labor
 market
 has


softened
 and
 that
 there's
 further
 risk.


Everyone
 agrees
 on
 that.
 where
 the
 where


the
 difference
 is
 is
 how
 do
 you
 weight


those
 risks
 and
 what
 does
 your
 forecast


look
 like
 and
 and
 and
 where
 do


ultimately
 ultim
 where
 do
 you
 think
 the


bigger
 risk
 is
 and
 and
 you
 know
 it's


very
 unusual
 to
 have
 uh
 persistent


tension
 between
 the
 two
 parts
 of
 the


mandate
 and
 when
 you
 do
 this
 is
 what
 you


see
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 actually
 uh


what
 you
 would
 expect
 to
 see
 and
 we
 do


see
 it
 meanwhile
 the
 discussions
 we
 have


are
 as
 good
 as
 any
 we've
 had
 in
 my
 14


years
 at
 the
 Fed
 they're
 very
 thoughtful


respectful
 And
 you
 just
 have
 people
 who


have
 strong
 views
 and
 you
 know
 we
 we


come
 together
 and
 and
 we
 reach
 we
 reach


u


you
 know
 a
 place
 where
 we
 can
 make
 a


decision.
 We
 made
 a
 decision
 today.
 We


had
 you
 know
 nine
 out
 of
 12
 supported


it.
 So
 fairly
 broad
 support.
 Um
 but
 it's


not
 like
 the
 nor
 normal
 situation
 where


everyone
 agrees
 on
 the
 direction
 and


what
 and
 what
 to
 do.
 It's
 more
 it's
 more


spread
 out
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 only


inherent
 in
 the
 situation
 in
 terms
 of


what
 it
 would
 take.
 you
 know,
 we
 all


have
 an
 outlook
 in
 terms
 of
 what's
 going


to
 come,
 but
 I
 think
 ultimately
 uh


having
 cut
 75
 and
 you
 know
 that
 the


effects
 of
 the
 75
 basis
 points
 will
 only


begin
 to
 be
 coming
 in,
 as
 I've
 said


before
 a
 couple
 times,
 we're
 well


positioned
 to
 wait
 to
 see
 how
 the


economy
 evolves.
 We'll
 just
 have
 to
 see


and
 we
 will
 get,
 as
 you
 know,
 quite
 a


bit
 of
 data.
 I
 should
 mention
 on
 the


data,
 as
 long
 as
 I'm
 talking
 about
 it,


that
 um
 we're
 going
 to
 need
 to
 be


careful
 in
 assessing
 particularly
 the


the
 household
 uh
 survey
 data.
 Uh
 there


there
 are
 very
 technical
 uh
 reasons


about
 the
 way
 data
 are
 collected
 in
 some


of
 these
 measures
 both
 in
 you
 know


inflation
 and
 in
 uh
 in
 labor
 in
 the


labor
 market.
 uh
 so
 that
 the
 the
 data


may
 be
 distorted
 and
 not
 just
 not
 just


sort
 of
 more
 volatile
 but
 distorted
 and


and
 that's
 it's
 uh
 and
 that's
 really


because
 data
 was
 not
 collected
 in


October
 and
 half
 of
 November.
 So
 we're


going
 to
 get
 data
 but
 we're
 going to


have
 to
 look
 at
 it
 carefully
 and
 with
 a


somewhat
 skeptical
 eye
 by
 the
 time
 of


the
 January
 meeting.
 Notwithstanding


that
 we
 will
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 December


data
 by
 the
 time
 of
 the
 January.
 So,
 we


expect
 to
 see
 a
 lot
 more,
 but
 I'm
 just


saying
 that
 the
 what
 we
 get
 for,
 for


example,
 CPI
 or
 for
 the
 uh
 for
 the
 um
 uh


uh
 household
 survey,
 uh
 we're
 going
 to


we're
 going
 to
 look
 we're
 going
 to
 look


at
 that
 really
 carefully
 and
 and


understand
 that
 it
 may
 be
 distorted
 by


very
 technical
 factors.


>> Going
 live
 right
 now.


>> Um
 one
 more
 question
 on
 desense.
 Um
 I


mean
 you
 talk
 about
 in
 a
 very
 positive


way
 just
 given
 the
 complicated
 nature
 of


the
 situation
 we're
 in
 economically
 but


is
 there
 any
 point
 in
 which
 those


descents
 become
 counterproductive
 either


to
 you
 know
 the
 Fed's
 communication
 and


the
 messaging
 around
 the
 policy
 path


forward?


>> I
 wouldn't
 I
 don't
 feel
 that
 we're
 at


that
 point
 at
 all.
 I
 don't
 I
 I
 would
 say


again
 these
 are
 these
 are
 good


thoughtful
 respectful
 discussions
 and


you
 hear
 people
 say
 and
 you'll
 hear
 you


hear
 many
 many
 outside
 analysts
 say
 the


same
 thing.
 I
 could
 make
 a
 case
 for


either
 for
 either
 side.
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 could


make
 that
 case.
 It's
 it's
 a
 close
 call.


We
 have
 to
 make
 decisions
 and
 uh
 we
 you


know
 we
 always
 hope
 that
 the
 data
 will


will
 give
 us
 a
 clear

 But
 in
 this


situation
 you
 you
 have
 you
 have


competing
 as
 if
 you
 look
 to
 if
 you
 look


through
 the
 SCP
 you'll
 see
 that
 a
 very


large
 number
 of
 participants
 agree
 that


risks
 are
 to
 the
 upside
 for
 unemployment


and
 to
 the
 upside
 for
 inflation.
 So
 what


do
 you
 do?
 You've
 got
 one
 tool,
 you


can't
 do
 two
 things
 at
 once.
 So,
 at
 what


pace
 do
 you
 move,
 how
 how
 what
 what
 size


moves
 do
 you
 make
 and
 that
 kind
 of


thing?
 And
 what
 what's
 the
 timing
 of


them?
 It's
 it's
 very
 it's
 a
 very


challenging
 situation.
 I
 think
 we're
 in


a
 good
 place
 to,
 as
 I
 mentioned,
 to
 wait


and
 see
 how
 the
 economy
 evolves.


>> Nick
 Timos
 of
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal.


Um,
 Chair
 Powell,
 there's
 been
 some


discussion
 recently
 of
 the
 1990s.
 In
 the


1990s,
 the
 committee
 did
 two
 discrete


sequences
 of
 three
 quarter
 point
 cuts.


One
 in
 199596
 and
 one
 in
 1998.
 And
 after


both
 of
 those,
 the
 next
 move
 in
 rates


was
 up,
 not
 down.
 With
 policy
 now
 closer


to
 neutral,
 is
 it
 a
 foregone
 conclusion


that
 the
 next
 move
 in
 rates
 is
 down,
 or


should
 we
 think
 of
 policy
 risks
 as


genuinely
 two-sided
 from
 here?


>> So,
 I
 don't
 think
 that


um
 a
 a
 rate
 hike
 is
 anybody's
 base
 as


the
 next
 thing
 is
 anybody's
 base
 case
 at


this
 point.
 And
 I'm
 not
 hearing
 that.


What
 you
 what
 you
 see
 is
 um
 some
 people


feel
 we
 should
 stop
 here
 and
 and
 that


we're
 at
 the
 right
 place
 and
 just
 wait.


Some
 people
 feel
 like
 we
 should
 cut
 once


or
 more
 this
 year
 and
 next
 year.
 But
 the


the
 but
 when
 people
 are
 writing
 down


their
 estimates
 of
 policy
 of
 where
 it


should
 go,
 it
 it
 is
 is
 either
 holding


here
 or
 cutting
 a
 little
 or
 cutting
 more


than
 a
 little.
 So
 I
 don't
 see
 that
 as
 I


don't
 see
 the
 base
 case
 as
 involving


that.
 So
 of
 course
 you
 know
 a
 data
 set


of
 two
 now
 three
 is
 is
 not
 a
 big
 data


set
 but
 I
 you're
 you
 are
 right
 about


those
 two
 uh
 three
 cut
 times
 in
 in
 the


90s.
 If
 I
 could
 follow
 up,
 the


unemployment
 rate
 has
 been
 rising
 very


gradually
 for
 the
 better
 part
 of
 two


years,
 and
 indeed
 the
 statement
 today
 no


longer
 describes
 the
 unemployment
 rate


as
 remaining
 low.
 What
 gives
 you


confidence
 it
 won't
 continue
 rising
 in


2026,
 especially
 when
 housing
 and
 other


rate
 sensitive
 sectors
 still
 appear
 to


be
 feeling
 restrictive
 policy
 from
 the


uh
 notwithstanding
 the
 150
 basis
 points


and
 cuts
 prior
 to
 today.
 So
 the
 the
 I


think
 the
 idea
 is
 that
 with
 with
 now


having
 cut
 755
 basis
 points
 more
 now
 and


having
 policy
 you
 know
 I'd
 call
 it
 in
 a


broad
 range
 of
 of
 plausible
 estimates
 of


neutral
 that
 that
 will
 be
 a
 place
 which


will
 enable
 the
 labor
 market
 to


stabilize
 or
 to
 only
 tick
 up
 one
 or
 two


more
 tents
 but
 we
 won't
 see
 uh
 you
 know


any
 kind
 of
 a
 sharper
 downturn
 which
 we


haven't
 seen
 any
 evidence
 evidence
 of
 at


all.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 uh,
 policy
 is


still
 in
 a
 place
 where
 it's
 not


accommodative
 and
 and
 we
 feel
 like
 we


feel
 like
 we
 have
 made
 progress
 this


year
 in
 non-tariff
 related
 inflation
 and


it
 as
 tariffs
 come
 through
 as
 they
 flow


through
 that'll
 show
 through
 next
 year.


But,
 as
 I
 said,
 we're
 we're
 well
 past


well
 placed
 to
 to
 wait
 and
 see
 how
 that


turns
 out.
 That
 is
 our
 expectation.
 But,


you
 know,
 we're
 going
 to
 start
 to
 see


the
 data
 and
 it'll
 tell
 us
 whether
 we


were
 right
 or
 not.


>> Claire
 Jones,
 Financial
 Times.
 Um,
 a
 lot


of
 people
 interpreted
 your
 comments
 at


the
 October
 meeting
 that,
 you
 know,
 when


there's
 a
 foggy
 situation,
 we
 slow
 down


to
 mean
 that,
 you
 know,
 there
 won't
 be
 a


cut
 now,
 there'd
 be
 a
 cut
 in
 January


instead.
 So
 it'd
 be
 good
 to
 get
 a
 sense


of
 why
 did
 the
 committee
 decide
 to
 move


today
 rather
 than
 to
 move
 in
 January


instead.
 Thank
 you.


>> Right.
 So
 in
 October
 I
 said
 um
 that


there
 was
 no
 certainty
 of
 moving
 and


that
 was
 that
 was
 indeed
 correct.
 I
 said


it's
 possible
 you
 could
 think
 about
 it


that
 way
 but
 I
 was
 careful
 to
 say
 other


people
 could
 look
 at
 it
 differently.
 So


why
 did
 we
 move
 today?
 You
 know
 I
 would


say
 point
 to
 a
 couple
 things.
 First
 of


all,
 gradual
 cooling
 in
 the
 labor
 market


has
 continued.
 Unemployment
 is
 now
 up


3/10en
 from
 June
 through
 September.


Payroll
 jobs
 uh
 averaging
 40,000
 per


month
 since
 April.
 We
 think
 there's
 an


overstatement
 in
 in
 these
 numbers
 by


about
 60,000.
 So
 that
 would
 be
 negative


20,000
 per
 month.
 Um
 and
 also
 just
 to


point
 one
 other
 thing,
 surveys
 of


households
 and
 businesses
 both
 showed


declining
 supply
 and
 demand
 for
 workers.


So
 I
 think
 you
 can
 say
 that
 the
 labor


market
 has
 um
 uh
 continued
 to
 cool


gradually
 maybe
 just
 a
 touch
 more


gradually
 than
 we
 thought.
 um
 you
 know


in
 terms
 of
 inflation
 um
 we
 are
 it's
 get


come
 in
 a
 touch
 lower
 and
 I
 think
 the


evidence
 is
 is
 uh
 kind
 of
 growing
 that


what's
 happening
 here
 is
 services


inflation
 coming
 down
 and
 that's
 offset


by
 increases
 in
 in
 in
 goods
 and
 that


goods
 inflation
 is
 entirely
 in
 sectors


where
 there
 are
 tariffs.
 So
 that
 does


build
 on
 the
 story
 and
 so
 far
 it's
 only


a
 story
 that
 this
 is
 that
 that
 the
 goods


inflation
 which
 is
 really
 the
 source
 of


the
 excess
 at
 this
 point
 that
 that
 uh
 mo


almost
 more
 than
 half
 the
 source
 of
 the


excess
 inflation
 is
 goods
 is
 tariffs
 and


you've
 got
 to
 say
 then
 so
 what
 do
 we


expect
 from
 tariffs
 um
 and
 it's
 I
 would


say
 that
 is
 to
 some
 extent
 down
 to


looking
 for
 broader
 economic
 uh
 you
 know


uh
 heat
 you
 know
 do
 we
 see
 a
 hot
 econ


economy.
 Do
 we
 see
 constraints?
 Do
 we


see
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 wages?
 You
 saw


the
 ECI
 report
 today.
 It
 doesn't
 feel


like
 a
 hot
 economy
 that
 wants
 to


generate,
 you
 know,
 Philips
 curve
 kind


of
 inflation.
 So,
 we
 look
 at
 all
 those


things
 um
 and
 we
 say
 that
 this
 was
 a


decision
 to
 make.
 It
 obviously
 wasn't
 uh


unanimous
 and
 um
 but
 overall
 that
 was


the
 judgment
 that
 that
 we
 made
 and


that's
 the
 action
 we
 took.


>> That
 is
 just
 reserves
 point.
 How


concerned
 were
 people
 around
 the
 table


about
 some
 of
 the
 tensions
 we've
 seen
 in


money
 markets?


>> I
 wouldn't
 say
 concerned.
 So,
 what
 what


really
 happened
 is
 this
 um
 uh
 balance


sheet
 shrinkage,
 sometimes
 called
 QT


went
 on.
 We
 had
 a
 framework
 in
 place
 for


monitoring
 it
 and
 nothing
 happened.
 The


overnight
 reverse
 repo
 facility
 went


down
 pretty
 much
 close
 to
 zero.
 Uh
 and


then
 beginning
 in
 in
 September,
 uh
 the


federal
 funds
 rate
 started
 to
 tick
 up


within
 the
 range,
 right?
 And
 it
 ticked


up
 almost
 all
 the
 way
 to
 uh
 Intertorm


reserve
 balances.
 There's
 nothing
 wrong


with
 that.
 What
 that's
 telling
 you
 is


that
 we're
 actually
 in
 reserves
 in
 an


ample
 reserves
 regime.
 So,
 you
 know,
 we


we
 knew
 this
 was
 going
 to
 come.
 When
 it


finally
 did
 come,
 it
 came
 a
 little


quicker
 than
 expected,
 but
 we
 were


absolutely
 there
 to
 take
 the
 actions


that
 we
 said
 we
 would
 take.
 So,
 and
 we


those
 actions
 are
 today.
 So,
 you
 know,


we
 we
 announced
 that
 we're
 resuming


reserve
 management
 purchases.
 That
 is


completely
 separate
 from
 monetary


policy.
 It's
 just
 we
 need
 to
 keep
 an


ample
 supply
 of
 reserves
 out
 there.
 Why


so
 big?
 The
 answer
 to
 that
 is
 uh
 you


know,
 if
 you
 look
 ahead,
 you'll
 see
 that


that
 April
 15th
 is
 coming
 up
 and
 our
 our


framework
 is
 such
 that
 we
 want
 to
 have


ample
 reserves
 even
 at
 times
 when


reserves
 are
 at
 a
 low
 level
 temporarily.


So,
 that's
 what
 happens
 on
 tax
 day.


people
 pay
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 to
 the


government,
 reserves
 drop
 sharply
 and


temporarily.
 So
 this
 seasonal
 buildup


that
 we'll
 see
 in
 the
 next
 few
 months


was
 going
 to
 happen
 anyway.
 It
 was
 going


to
 happen
 because
 April
 15th
 is
 April


15th.
 There's
 also
 a
 secular
 ongoing


growth
 of
 the
 balance
 sheet.
 We
 have
 to


keep
 reserves
 call
 it
 constant
 as
 a
 as


it
 relates
 to
 the
 banking
 system
 or
 to


the
 whole
 whole
 economy.
 And
 that
 alone


calls
 for
 us
 to
 increase
 about
 2025


billion
 dollars
 per
 month.
 So
 that's
 a


small
 part
 that
 that's
 going
 on.
 It's


also
 happening
 in
 the
 context
 of
 a


temporary
 few
 month
 uh
 frontloading
 to


get
 to
 get
 reserves
 high
 enough
 to
 get


through
 the
 you
 know
 the
 tax
 period
 in


in
 in
 midappril.
 So
 that's
 what's


happening
 there.


>> Andrew.


>> Um
 thanks
 Mr.
 Chairman.
 Um
 uh
 this
 is


the
 last
 post
 FOMC
 press
 conference
 uh


before
 an
 important
 Supreme
 Court
 uh


hearing
 next
 month.
 Can
 you
 talk
 about


how
 you're
 hoping
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 will


rule
 and
 uh
 I'm
 just
 curious
 why
 the


Fed's
 been
 so
 reticent
 on
 such
 a
 pivotal


matter.


>> Big
 question.


>> It's
 not
 something
 I
 I
 want
 to
 address


here,
 Andrew.
 Um
 you
 know,
 we're
 not
 uh


we're
 not
 legal
 commentators.
 It's
 it's


before
 the
 courts
 and
 uh
 we
 think
 our
 we


we
 don't
 think
 that
 we
 help
 matters
 by


trying
 to
 engage
 as
 a
 as
 a
 as
 a
 as
 a


public
 discussion
 of
 that.
 I'll
 give
 you


a
 mulligan
 though.


>> Thanks.


>> That
 means
 I
 get
 three
 questions
 but
 uh


>> just
 one
 just
 one
 more.
 I


>> I
 guess
 I
 wanted
 to
 come
 back
 to
 the
 the


1990s
 question
 and
 and
 like
 do
 you
 see


that
 as
 a
 useful
 model
 for
 thinking


about
 uh
 what
 is
 happening
 in
 the


economy
 right
 now?


>> I
 don't
 think
 it
 rises
 to
 that
 level.
 So


I
 did
 think
 that
 in
 in
 200
 was
 it
 19


where
 we
 cut
 three
 times
 but
 you
 know


this
 is
 such
 a
 unique
 situation.
 We
 this


is
 it's
 not
 um
 uh
 it's
 not
 the
 1970s


let's
 put
 it
 that
 way
 but
 we
 do
 have


tension
 between
 our
 two
 goals
 and
 so


that's
 that's
 just
 unique
 in
 in
 my
 time


at
 the
 Fed
 and
 I
 think
 going
 back
 a
 long


ways
 we
 haven't
 had
 that
 in
 our


framework.
 Our
 framework,
 as
 you
 know,


says
 that
 when
 that's
 the
 case,
 then
 we


try
 to,
 you
 know,
 take
 a
 balanced


approach
 to
 to
 the
 two
 things
 and
 we


look
 at
 how
 far
 they
 are
 and
 how
 long
 it


would
 take
 to
 get
 them
 back
 to
 each
 of


them
 back
 to
 the
 goal.
 That's
 a
 very


subjective
 analysis
 really,
 but
 it
 just


tells
 you
 you've
 gota
 and
 I
 think


ultimately
 what
 it
 says
 is
 when
 they're


broadly
 equally
 threatened
 or
 equally
 at


risk,
 you
 should
 be
 kind
 of
 neutral


because
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 either


accommodative
 or
 or
 or
 tight,
 you're


favoring
 one
 or
 the
 other
 goal.
 And
 so


we've
 been
 trying
 to
 we've
 been
 sort
 of


moving
 in
 the
 direction
 of
 neutral.
 Now


we're
 in
 the
 range
 of
 neutral.
 We're
 in


the
 high
 end
 of
 the
 range
 of
 neutral,
 I


would
 say.
 And
 that's
 what
 we're
 doing


now.
 it
 it's
 so
 happened
 that
 we
 we've


cut
 three
 times
 that
 you
 know
 we
 have
 we


haven't
 made
 any
 decision
 about
 January


but
 as
 as
 I've
 said
 we
 think
 we're
 well


positioned
 to
 uh
 wait
 and
 see
 how
 the


economy
 performs


>> Edward


>> thanks
 Mr.
 Chairman
 Edward
 Lawrence
 uh


with
 Fox
 Business.
 I
 wanted
 to
 ask
 you


um
 the
 inflation
 expectations
 uh
 has
 has


come
 down
 in
 your
 SCP
 report.
 Um
 do
 you


see
 the
 tariff
 price
 increases
 as


passing
 through
 in
 the
 next
 three


months?
 Is
 it
 a
 six-month
 process
 that


we're
 looking
 for
 that
 to
 end?
 And
 then


because
 of
 that,
 is
 jobs
 the
 threat
 to


the
 economy?


>> So
 with
 with
 tariff
 inflation,
 you
 know,


it
 takes
 there's
 the
 announcement
 of
 a


tariff
 and
 then
 there's,
 you
 know,
 they


start
 to
 take
 effect
 and
 then
 it
 takes


some
 months.
 goods
 may
 have
 to
 be


shipped
 from
 other
 parts
 of
 the,
 you


know,
 it
 may
 take,
 you
 know,
 quite
 a


while
 for
 an
 individual
 tariff
 to
 take


its
 full
 effect.
 But
 once
 it's
 had
 that


effect,
 then
 the
 question
 is,
 isn't
 that


just
 a
 one-time
 price
 increase?
 So,


we've
 actually
 we
 actually
 look
 at
 it


all
 of
 the
 announcements
 and
 and
 and
 and


what
 you
 get
 from
 all
 that,
 you
 see
 sort


of
 a
 for
 each
 one
 of
 them,
 there's
 a


time
 period
 and
 then
 then
 it's
 fully
 in.


So
 if
 there
 are
 no
 new
 tariff


announcements
 and
 we
 don't
 know
 that
 but


let's
 assume
 there
 are
 no
 major
 new


tariff
 announcements
 inflation
 from


goods
 uh
 should
 peak
 in
 the
 first


quarter
 or
 so
 right
 or
 roughly
 you
 know


we
 haven't
 been
 able
 to
 predict
 this


with
 any
 precision
 no
 one
 is
 but
 call
 it


the
 first
 quarter
 or
 or
 so
 of
 next
 year


should
 be
 the
 peak
 and
 from
 here
 it


should
 be
 it
 shouldn't
 be
 big
 it
 should


be
 a
 couple
 tenths
 or
 or
 even
 less
 than


that
 we
 don't
 really
 have
 precision
 on


this
 but
 and
 after
 that
 again
 if
 there


are
 no
 new
 tariffs
 that
 that
 are
 being


announced
 that
 will
 take
 nine
 months
 to


get
 fully
 in.
 Nine
 months
 is
 also
 an


estimate.
 Um
 then
 you
 should
 start
 to


see
 that
 coming
 down
 in
 the
 back
 half
 of


next
 year.


>> And
 and
 I
 want
 to
 see
 if
 I
 could
 address


sort
 of
 the
 elephant
 the
 room.
 The


president's
 been
 talking
 openly
 about
 um


a
 new
 Fed
 chairman.
 Does
 that
 hinder


your
 current
 job
 right
 now
 or
 change


your
 thinking
 at
 all?


>> No.


>> No
 mulligans
 for
 it.
 Michael
 Michael


McKe
 from
 Bloomberg
 radio
 and


television.
 Uh
 tenure
 rates
 have
 are
 50


basis
 points
 higher
 than
 when
 you


started
 cutting
 back
 in
 September
 of


2024
 and
 the
 yield
 curve
 basically
 has


been
 steepening.
 Uh
 why
 do
 you
 think


that
 continuing
 to
 cut
 now,
 especially


in
 the
 absence
 of
 data
 is
 going
 to
 bring


down
 the
 yield
 on
 the
 thing
 that
 will


move
 the
 economy
 the
 most?


>> So
 we're
 looking
 at
 the
 real
 economy
 and


focusing
 on
 that.
 And
 you
 have
 you've


got
 when
 the
 when
 the
 long
 bonds
 move


around,
 you've
 got
 to
 look
 at
 why


they're
 moving
 around.
 If
 you
 look
 at


inflation
 compensation,
 it's
 very
 con


you
 that's
 one
 part
 of
 it
 is
 is


inflation
 compensation
 break
 evens
 and


you
 know
 they're
 at
 very
 comfortable


levels,
 they're
 at
 levels
 consistent


past
 the
 once
 you
 get
 out
 past
 the
 very


short
 term
 now
 break
 evens
 are
 at
 a
 you


know
 at
 at
 quite
 levels
 that
 are
 quite


consistent
 with
 2%
 inflation
 over
 time.


So
 there's
 nothing
 happening
 with
 rates


going
 up
 out
 there
 that
 suggests
 concern


about
 inflation
 in
 the
 long
 term
 or


anything
 like
 that.
 I
 mean
 I
 look
 I
 look


at
 these
 things
 pretty
 regularly.
 Same


thing
 with
 surveys.
 Surveys
 are
 all


saying
 that
 uh
 the
 public
 understands


our
 commitment
 to
 2%
 and
 and
 expects
 us


to
 get
 back
 there.
 So
 So
 why
 why
 are


rates
 going
 up?
 It
 has
 to
 be
 something


else.
 It
 must
 be,
 you
 know,
 an


expectation
 of
 higher
 growth
 or


something
 like
 that.
 And
 that's
 that's
 a


lot
 of
 what's
 been
 going
 on.
 I
 mean,
 you


saw
 a
 big
 move,
 you
 know,
 toward
 the
 end


of
 last
 year,
 which
 was
 not
 to
 do
 with


us.
 It
 was
 to
 do
 with
 other


developments.


>> Well,
 you
 just
 mentioned
 that
 um
 we're


the
 public
 is
 expecting
 you
 to
 get
 back


to
 2%
 and
 Americans
 overwhelmingly
 are


citing
 high
 prices,
 inflation
 as
 their


number
 one
 concern.
 Can
 you
 explain
 to


them
 why
 you're
 prioritizing


uh
 the
 labor
 market,
 which
 seems


relatively
 stable
 to
 most
 people,


instead
 of
 their
 number
 one
 concern,


inflation?
 So
 we
 um
 as
 you
 know
 we
 have


a
 network
 of
 contacts
 in
 the
 US
 economy


which
 is
 really
 unmatched
 if
 you
 go


through
 the
 12
 reserve
 banks.
 Uh
 so
 we


hear
 loud
 and
 clear
 how
 people
 are


experiencing
 um
 really
 costs.
 It's


really
 it's
 really
 high
 costs
 and
 a
 lot


of
 that
 is
 not
 the
 current
 rate
 of


inflation.
 A
 lot
 of
 that
 is
 just


embedded
 higher
 cost
 due
 to
 higher


inflation
 in
 2022
 and
 23.
 Uh
 so
 that's


what's
 going
 on.
 And
 so
 the
 best
 thing


we
 can
 do
 is
 restore
 inflation
 to
 to
 to


to
 its
 2%
 goal
 and
 our
 policy
 is
 is


intended
 to
 do
 that.
 But
 also
 have
 a


strong
 economy
 where
 real
 wages
 are


going
 up,
 where
 people
 are
 getting
 jobs


and
 and
 earning
 money
 and
 and
 uh
 we're


going
 to
 need
 to
 have
 some
 years
 where


real
 compensation
 is
 higher.
 You
 know,


it's
 positive,
 significantly
 positive.


So
 wages,
 nominal
 wages
 are
 higher
 than


inflation
 for
 people
 to
 start
 feeling


good
 about
 affordability,
 the


affordability
 issue.
 And
 you
 know,
 so


we're
 we're
 working
 hard
 on
 that.
 We


want
 to
 we're
 trying
 to
 keep
 inflation


under
 control,
 but
 also
 support
 the


labor
 market
 and
 strong
 wages
 so
 that


people
 are
 earning
 enough
 money
 and
 and


feeling
 economically
 healthy
 again.


>> Victoria,


>> he's
 been
 dovish
 so
 far.


>> Hi,
 Victoria
 Aguido
 with
 just
 to
 follow


up
 on
 that.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 now
 the


third
 time
 that
 you've
 cut
 this
 year
 and


inflation
 is
 around
 3%.
 So,
 is
 the


message
 that
 you're
 sort
 of
 trying
 to


send
 with
 that
 that
 you're
 okay
 with


where
 inflation
 is
 for
 now
 as
 long
 as


people
 understand
 that
 at
 some
 point
 you


still
 want
 to
 get
 back
 to
 2%
 because


inflation
 is
 relatively
 stable
 where
 it


is.


>> Everyone
 should
 understand
 and
 the


surveys
 show
 that
 they
 do
 that
 we're


committed
 to
 2%
 inflation
 and
 we
 will


deliver
 2%
 inflation.
 But
 it's
 a


complicated,
 unusual,
 difficult


situation
 where
 the
 labor
 market
 is
 also


under
 pressure
 where
 job
 creation
 may


actually
 be
 negative.
 Now
 supply
 of


workers
 has
 also
 gone
 way
 down.
 So
 the


unemployment
 rate
 hasn't
 moved
 that


much,
 but
 um
 you
 know
 it's
 it's
 a
 labor


market
 that
 that
 seems
 to
 have


significant
 downside
 risks.
 People
 care


a
 lot
 about
 that.
 That's
 their
 jobs.


That's
 their
 ability
 if
 they
 get
 laid


off
 or
 if
 they're
 entering
 the
 labor


force
 to
 find
 work.
 So
 that's
 that's


really
 important
 to
 people.
 Um
 the
 story


with
 inflation
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 we're


well
 aware
 that
 this
 is
 a
 story
 at
 this


point
 is
 that
 the
 if
 you
 get
 away
 from


tariffs
 inflation
 is
 in
 the
 low
 twos


right
 so
 it's
 really
 tariffs
 and
 that


that's
 causing
 the
 most
 of
 the
 inflation


overshoot
 and
 we
 do
 think
 of
 those
 as


likely
 to
 in
 the
 current
 situation
 as


likely
 to
 be
 a
 one-time


you
 know
 one-time
 price
 increase.
 Our


job
 is
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 it
 is
 and
 we


will
 do
 that
 job.
 But
 right
 now
 you


you've
 got
 this
 difficult
 balance
 and


there
 risks
 to
 both
 sides.
 There's
 no


risk-free
 path.
 If
 we
 were
 if
 we
 you


know
 if
 it
 was
 just
 inflation
 and
 the


labor
 market
 was
 just
 really
 strong
 and


then
 we
 rates
 would
 be
 higher
 as
 they


were
 for
 more
 than
 a
 year.
 You
 know
 we


didn't
 have
 to
 worry
 about
 inflation


sorry
 about
 the
 about
 the
 labor
 market.


Uh
 because
 the
 labor
 market
 unemployment


was
 very
 low
 if
 you
 remember
 when


inflation
 was
 very
 high.
 Uh
 there
 was
 a


labor
 shortage.
 So
 we
 could
 focus


entirely
 on
 on
 inflation.
 Now
 it's


different.
 We
 actually
 have
 risks
 to


both.
 And
 I
 think
 we're
 we're
 doing
 the


best
 we
 can
 for
 people.
 They
 also
 care


about
 their
 jobs.
 They
 do
 care
 about


affordability.
 And
 the
 best
 thing
 we
 can


do
 there
 is
 to
 is
 both
 to
 support


economic
 activity,
 but
 also,
 you
 know,


um
 make
 sure
 that
 when
 tariff
 inflation


goes
 down
 and
 disappears,
 inflation


lands
 around
 2%.


>> Elizabeth,


>> thanks
 so
 much.
 Elizabeth
 Schelsey
 with


ABC
 News.
 Just
 to
 follow
 up,
 you
 keep


talking
 about
 job
 growth
 being
 negative.


Why
 do
 you
 think
 job
 growth
 is
 so
 much


worse
 than
 some
 of
 the
 official
 data?


Why
 do
 you
 think
 job
 growth
 is
 to
 follow


up
 on
 your
 comments
 about
 job
 growth?


Why
 is
 it
 so
 much
 worse
 than
 the


official
 data
 is
 suggesting?


>> Oh,
 well,
 we
 just
 we
 know
 I
 think
 it's


it's
 um
 this
 is
 I
 don't
 think
 this
 is


particularly
 controversial.
 There's
 a


it's
 very
 difficult
 to
 to
 estimate
 job


growth
 in
 real
 time.
 They
 don't
 count


everybody.
 they
 have
 a
 survey
 and


there's
 been
 something
 of
 a
 systematic


overcount
 and
 so
 we
 we
 expected
 and
 they


correct
 it
 twice
 a
 year.
 So
 the
 last


time
 they
 corrected
 it
 we
 thought
 the


correction
 would
 be
 eight
 or
 900,000.
 I


won't
 get
 the
 numbers
 exactly
 right
 and


that
 was
 that
 was
 exactly
 what
 happened.


So
 we
 think
 that
 that
 has
 persisted
 and


uh
 so
 there's
 there's
 an
 overcount
 in


the
 payroll
 job
 numbers
 we
 think


continuing
 and
 it
 will
 be
 corrected.
 I


don't
 have
 the
 exact
 month
 in
 my
 head


right
 now,
 but
 and
 that's
 just
 I
 don't


again
 I
 think
 forecasters
 generally


understand
 that.
 So
 and
 we
 think
 it's


about
 60,000
 a
 month.
 So
 40,000
 jobs


could
 be
 negative
 20
 and
 you
 know
 that


could
 be
 wrong
 by
 10
 or
 20
 in
 either


direction.
 But
 in
 any
 case
 and
 but
 the


thing
 is
 that's
 um
 that's
 job
 creation


in
 a
 way
 that's
 job
 that's
 demand.
 Labor


supply
 has
 also
 come
 down
 quite
 sharply.


So,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 had
 had
 a
 world


where
 there
 just
 there's
 just
 no
 growth


in
 workers
 and
 you
 really
 don't
 need
 a


lot
 of
 jobs
 to
 have
 a
 to
 have
 full


employment,
 some
 people
 argue
 that's


what
 we're
 looking
 at.
 But
 I
 think
 a


world
 where
 job
 creation
 is
 negative.
 I


just
 think
 we
 need
 to
 watch
 that


situation
 very
 carefully
 and
 be
 in
 a


position
 where
 we're
 where
 we're
 not,


you
 know,
 pushing
 down
 on
 job
 creation


with
 our
 policy.
 When
 we're
 talking


about
 supply,
 we
 have
 seen
 major


American
 employers
 like
 Amazon
 site
 AI


and
 job
 cuts.
 How
 much
 right
 now
 are
 you


factoring
 in
 AI
 into
 the
 current


weakness
 in
 the
 job
 market?


>> So,
 it
 it's
 probably
 part
 of
 the
 story.


It's
 not
 it's
 not
 a
 big
 part
 of
 the


story
 yet.
 And
 we
 don't
 know
 whether
 it


will
 be,
 but
 um
 you
 know,
 for
 example,


if
 you
 look
 at
 you
 can't
 miss
 the
 big


announcements
 of
 layoffs
 and
 and
 also


companies
 uh
 saying
 that
 they're
 they're


not
 going
 to
 hire
 anybody
 for
 a
 long


time
 and
 they
 cite
 AI
 that
 that's
 all


clearly
 happening.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 um,


people
 are
 not
 filing
 for
 unemployment


insurance
 and,
 uh,
 since
 job
 creation,


job
 finding
 rates
 are
 extremely
 low.
 If


there
 were
 big
 numbers
 of
 layoffs,
 you


you'd
 expect
 the
 the
 continuing
 claims


to
 go
 up
 and
 you'd
 expect
 new
 claims
 to


go
 up.
 It
 really
 haven't
 much.
 So,
 it's


it's
 a
 little
 bit
 curious.
 Longer
 term


though,
 you
 know,
 the
 question
 is
 what


are
 we
 going
 to
 see
 here?
 And
 we
 don't


we
 don't
 know
 but
 it's
 you
 know
 there's


a
 it
 may
 be
 that
 in
 past
 technology


really
 significant
 tech
 technology
 uh
 uh


innovation
 eras
 you
 have
 seen
 some
 jobs


destroyed
 and
 other
 jobs
 made.


Ultimately
 what's
 happened
 for
 a
 couple


hundred
 years
 is
 when
 you
 get
 through


all
 that
 you
 have
 higher
 productivity


and
 you
 have
 you
 have
 new
 jobs
 and
 there


are
 enough
 jobs
 for
 people.
 This
 is
 a


this
 may
 be
 different.
 You
 know,
 it's


every
 time
 we
 have
 a
 wave
 of
 technology,


we
 think,
 "Oh,
 this
 could
 this
 could
 put


a
 lot
 of
 people
 out
 of
 work.
 What
 are


they
 going
 to
 do?"
 In
 the
 past,
 there's


always
 been
 more
 work
 and
 higher


productivity
 and
 incomes
 have
 risen.


What
 will
 happen
 here,
 we're
 going
 to


have
 to
 see,
 but
 right
 now
 is
 such
 early


days.
 We
 don't
 think
 we
 see
 much.
 Uh,


it's
 certainly
 not
 showing
 up
 in
 in


layoffs
 yet.


>> Thank
 you,
 Chair.
 Endur
 Bloomberg
 News.


Given
 the
 breadth
 of
 views
 on
 the
 policy


committee,
 why
 is
 there
 such
 a
 division


of
 views
 between
 the
 policy
 what


>> on
 the
 committee?


>> Thank
 you.


>> Why
 is
 there
 such
 a
 division
 of
 views


between
 the
 presidents
 and
 the
 board


members?


>> You
 know,
 it's
 it's
 not
 so
 stark
 is
 that


there
 there's
 de
 there
 the
 views
 are
 are


more
 varied
 on
 each
 in
 each
 group
 as


well.
 There's
 some
 of
 that,
 but
 I
 would


say
 they're
 also
 governors
 and
 and
 uh


and
 and
 they're
 they're
 they're
 people


in
 in
 both
 on
 both
 sides
 in
 both
 groups.


I
 wouldn't
 put
 too
 much
 in
 that.


>> Okay.
 And
 just
 to
 follow
 up
 is
 given


your
 growth
 upgrade
 um
 how
 would
 you


factor
 in
 or
 what
 would
 be
 the
 economic


impact
 if
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 is
 to
 strike


down
 the
 tariffs
 that
 they're
 currently


hearing
 please
 in
 terms
 of
 growth
 and


inflation.
 Thank
 you.


>> I
 I
 really
 don't
 know
 it
 would
 depend
 um


it
 would
 depend
 on
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of


things
 we
 don't
 know
 so
 I
 can't
 really


help
 you
 there.


Christine,
 thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you,
 Chair
 P.
 Christine
 Romans,


NBC
 News.
 I
 wanted
 to
 ask
 you
 about
 how


the
 higher
 income
 households
 are
 really


driving
 spending
 right
 now.
 They're


backed
 by
 home
 equity
 and
 stock
 market


wealth,
 but
 lower-income
 consumers
 are


really
 struggling
 with
 the
 accumulation


of
 five
 years
 now
 of
 rising
 prices.
 It's


price
 levels,
 not
 really
 the
 inflation


rate,
 holding
 some
 of
 these
 families


back.
 How
 sustainable
 is
 this
 so-called


K-shaped
 economy?
 and
 and
 what
 are
 the


Fed's
 thoughts
 on
 whether
 that's
 a
 risk


going
 forward?


>> So,
 we
 do
 um
 through
 our
 vast
 network
 of


contacts
 and
 just
 through
 our


observation
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the


economy,
 we
 hear
 about
 this
 a
 lot.
 Uh
 if


you
 listen
 to
 the
 earnings
 reports
 for


consumerf
 facing
 companies
 that
 tend
 to


deal
 with
 low
 and
 moderate
 income


people,
 they'll
 all
 say
 that
 we're


seeing
 people,
 you
 know,
 tightening


their
 belts,
 uh
 you
 know,
 changing


products
 that
 they
 buy,
 buying
 less
 and


that
 sort
 of
 thing.
 And
 so
 it's
 clearly


a
 thing.
 It's
 also
 clearly
 a
 thing
 that


you
 know
 asset
 values,
 housing
 values


and
 and
 and
 and
 securities
 values
 are


high
 and
 they
 tend
 to
 be
 owned
 by
 people


more
 at
 the
 higher
 end
 of
 the
 income
 and


wealth.
 So
 as
 how
 sustainable
 it
 is,
 I


don't
 know.
 Most
 of
 the
 consumption
 does


happen
 by
 people
 who
 have
 more
 means.
 Uh


I
 think
 you
 know
 the
 top
 the
 top
 third


accounts
 for
 way
 more
 than
 a
 third
 of


the
 consumption
 for
 example.
 So
 um
 it's


a
 good
 question
 how
 sustainable
 that
 is.


Uh
 you
 know
 the
 best
 we
 can
 do
 is
 to
 is


to
 have
 a
 you
 know
 price
 stability
 and
 a


strong
 labor
 market.
 What
 we
 saw
 um
 for


example
 what
 we
 saw
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


you
 know
 the
 very
 very
 long
 um
 expansion


that
 ended
 with
 the
 outbreak
 of
 the


pandemic.
 We
 saw
 that
 it
 was
 10
 years


and
 8
 months
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 The


longest
 one
 in
 recorded
 history.
 In
 the


last
 two
 years,
 most
 of
 the
 job,
 the


largest
 part
 of
 of
 the
 wage
 gains
 were


come
 going
 to
 people
 in
 the
 bottom


cortile,
 the
 bottom
 part
 of
 the
 lower


low
 and
 moderate
 income.
 So,
 you
 know,
 a


having
 a
 a
 strong
 labor
 market
 for
 a


long
 period
 of
 time
 is
 really
 really


good
 from
 a
 social
 standpoint.
 It
 it's


helping
 people
 at
 the
 lower
 income


levels
 and
 that's
 what
 we
 all
 want
 to


get
 back
 to.
 But
 we
 got
 to
 we
 got
 to


have
 price
 stability
 and
 we
 got
 to
 have


uh
 you
 know
 full
 employment,
 maximum


employment.


>> And
 just
 quickly,
 you
 mentioned
 the


housing
 market
 remains
 kind
 of
 weak
 with


these
 rate
 cuts
 that
 we've
 seen.
 Is


there
 a
 chance
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 more


affordability
 in
 the
 housing
 market
 so


more
 people
 can
 maybe
 enjoy
 that
 part
 of


wealth
 creation?
 I
 mean,
 the
 average
 age


or
 median
 age
 of
 a
 first-time
 home
 buyer


is
 now
 40
 years
 old.
 That's
 the
 highest


on
 record.


>> Yeah.
 So
 the
 housing
 market
 faces
 um


some
 really
 significant
 challenges
 and


uh
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 you
 know
 a
 25
 basis


point
 decline
 in
 the
 federal
 funds
 rate


is
 going
 to
 make
 much
 of
 a
 difference


for
 people.
 Um
 you
 know
 housing
 supply


is
 low.
 Many
 people
 have
 very
 very
 low


low
 uh
 uh
 low
 rate
 mortgages
 from
 the


pandemic
 period
 and
 they
 kept


refinancing
 and
 caught
 the
 the
 really


low.
 So
 it's
 made
 expensive
 to
 them
 to


move
 and
 you
 know
 we're
 we're
 a
 ways


away
 from
 that
 changing.
 Also
 we're
 just


we
 haven't
 built
 enough
 housing
 in
 the


country
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and
 so
 a
 lot
 of


estimates
 suggest
 that
 we
 just
 need
 more


housing
 of
 different
 kinds.
 So
 housing


is
 going
 to
 be
 you
 know
 a
 problem
 and


and
 you
 know
 really
 the
 tools
 to
 address


it
 are
 are
 we
 can
 we
 can
 raise
 and
 lower


interest
 rates
 but
 we
 don't
 really
 have


the
 tools
 to
 address
 you
 know
 a
 secular


housing
 shortage
 a
 structural
 housing


shortage.


Chris.


>> Uh,
 thanks
 Chris
 Rabber,
 Associated


Press.
 Um,
 you
 mentioned
 on
 inflation,


uh,
 services
 inflation
 being
 low,
 goods


inflation
 looking
 like
 maybe
 it'll
 peak.


Uh,
 we
 had
 the
 wages
 report
 you


mentioned
 today
 showing
 uh,
 moderating


wage
 growth.


Where
 are
 the
 inflation
 risks?
 It
 looks


like
 inflation
 is
 cooling
 in
 your
 view.


At
 the
 same
 time,
 you
 have
 potentially


negative
 hiring.
 Why
 not
 uh
 why
 aren't


we
 hearing
 more
 about
 maybe
 more
 cuts
 in


this
 environment?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 the
 risk
 risk
 inflation
 is


pretty
 clear
 to
 see
 and
 that
 is
 you
 know


we
 we
 see
 um
 higher
 inflation
 the
 as
 I


mentioned
 most
 of
 the
 inflation


overtarget
 is
 from
 goods
 and
 we
 think
 we


estimate
 we
 expect
 most
 of
 us
 that
 that


inflation
 will
 be
 a
 one-time
 price


increase
 and
 then
 come
 down.
 We
 just


came
 off
 an
 experience
 where
 um


inflation
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 much
 more


persistent
 than
 anyone
 had
 expected.
 Is


that
 going
 to
 happen
 now?
 Uh
 you
 know


that
 so
 that's
 the
 risk.
 The
 risk
 is
 is


either
 that
 that
 that
 tariff
 inflation


just
 turns
 out
 to
 be
 more
 and
 more


persistent
 maybe
 because
 uh
 uh
 companies


who
 are
 now
 holding
 back
 from
 passing


through
 the
 tariffs
 will
 just
 keep
 doing


that.
 So
 you'll
 see
 you
 see
 that.
 Um
 I


think
 the
 other
 possibility
 is
 is
 less


likely
 and
 that
 is
 just
 that
 uh
 you
 know


the
 labor
 market
 gets
 tight
 or
 the


economy
 gets
 tight
 and
 you
 see
 you
 know


just
 just
 traditional
 inflation.
 I
 I


don't
 see
 that
 as
 particularly
 likely.


But
 uh
 so
 I
 I
 think
 you
 know
 again
 uh


you
 know
 all
 across
 the
 committee
 uh


people
 see
 the
 the
 picture
 pretty


similarly
 but
 see
 the
 risks
 quite


differently.
 And
 some
 people
 do
 see
 the


the
 inflation
 risk
 and
 I
 I
 wouldn't


dismiss
 that
 case.
 I
 I
 don't
 dismiss


that
 case
 but
 you've
 got
 to
 you
 got
 to


make
 an
 assessment
 and
 this
 is
 the


assessment
 we
 made.


>> Hi
 Sure.
 Neil
 Irwin
 with
 Axios.
 Um,
 so


this
 has
 come
 up
 a
 couple
 of
 times


today,
 but
 to
 be
 clear,
 do
 you
 believe


that
 we're
 experiencing
 a
 positive


productivity
 shock
 whether
 from
 AI
 or


policy
 factors
 or
 whatever?
 Uh,
 and
 how


much
 of
 that
 is
 how
 much
 is
 that
 driving


the
 higher
 GDP
 projection
 in
 the
 SCP?


>> So
 yeah,
 I
 mean
 it
 uh
 I
 never
 thought
 I


would
 see
 a
 time
 when
 we
 had,
 you
 know,


five,
 six
 years
 of
 2%
 productivity


growth.
 This
 is
 this
 is
 higher,
 you


know,
 this
 is
 definitely
 higher.
 And
 it


was
 it
 was
 before
 before
 it
 could
 be


attributed
 to
 AI.
 I
 think
 you
 I
 I
 also


think
 if
 you
 look
 at
 what
 AI
 can
 do
 and


if
 you
 use
 it
 in
 your
 personal
 life,
 as


I
 I
 imagine
 many
 of
 us
 have,
 you
 can
 see


the
 prospects
 for
 productivity.
 I
 think


it
 makes
 people
 who
 use
 it
 more


productive.
 It
 may
 make
 other
 people


have
 to
 find
 other
 jobs
 though.
 So,
 so


it
 could
 have
 productivity
 implications


while
 also
 having,
 you
 know,
 social
 and


labor
 market
 implications
 that
 we
 don't


have
 the
 tools
 to
 deal
 with.
 But
 yes,
 I


think
 we
 are
 seeing
 we're
 definitely


seeing
 higher
 productivity.
 I
 don't
 I


think
 it's
 a
 little
 quick
 to
 be
 saying


it's
 it's
 generative
 AI,
 but
 um
 I
 don't


know,
 you
 know,
 the
 pandemic
 may
 have


induced
 people
 to
 do
 more
 automation
 and


do
 more
 things
 with
 computers
 to
 replace


people
 and
 that
 raises
 productivity,
 you


know,
 output
 per
 hour.
 Does
 that
 does


that
 imply
 a
 higher
 does
 that
 imply
 a


higher
 neutral
 rate
 and
 therefore
 the


policy
 might
 be
 a
 little
 easier
 than
 it


seems?


>> All
 you
 know
 all
 things
 equal
 yes
 but


all
 things
 aren't
 equal.
 There
 are
 many


uh
 many
 things
 pushing
 in
 in
 different


directions
 on
 where
 the
 neutral
 rate


would
 be.
 But
 yes,
 that
 that
 argument


does
 come
 up.


>> Uh
 Matt,


>> thanks
 Towel.
 Matt
 Eaggan
 with
 CNN.
 Um,


after
 today,
 you
 only
 have
 three
 more


meetings
 at
 the
 helm
 of
 the
 Fed.
 Since


becoming
 Fed
 Chair,
 you've
 seen
 multiple


trade
 wars,
 the
 pandemic,
 COVID


reopening,
 period
 of
 high
 inflation.
 I


know
 your
 term's
 not
 up
 as
 chair
 until


May,
 but
 I'm
 wondering
 if
 you've
 given


any
 thought
 to
 what
 you
 want
 your
 legacy


to
 be.


>> My
 legacy?
 I
 my
 thought
 is
 that


um
 I
 really
 want
 to
 turn
 this
 job
 over


to
 whoever
 replaces
 me
 in
 with
 the


economy
 in
 really
 good
 shape.
 That's


what
 I
 want
 to
 do.
 I
 want
 I
 want


inflation
 to
 be
 under
 control


coming
 back
 down
 to
 2%
 and
 I
 want
 the


labor
 market
 to
 be
 strong.
 That's
 what
 I


want.
 And
 uh
 all
 of
 my
 efforts
 are
 to
 to


get
 to
 that
 place.
 they
 have
 been
 all


along.
 But
 ultimately
 that's
 that's
 what


and
 it's
 you
 know
 I
 don't
 have
 time
 to


think
 about
 the
 bigger
 things.
 I
 have
 I


have
 I
 hope
 many
 years
 ahead
 to
 worry


about
 that
 but
 there's
 enough
 to
 do.


>> Relatedly
 um
 have
 you
 given
 any
 more


thought
 and
 can
 you
 tell
 us
 any
 more


about
 your
 plans
 on
 whether
 or
 not
 you


plan
 to
 stay
 on
 the
 Fed
 board
 of


governors
 even
 after
 your
 term
 as
 chair


expires?


>> Again
 I'm
 I'm
 focused
 on
 I'm
 focused
 on


my
 remaining
 time
 as
 chair.
 I
 haven't


got
 anything
 new
 on
 that
 to
 tell
 you.


>> Go
 to
 Mark
 for
 the
 last
 question.


>> Chairman
 Mark
 Hamick
 with
 Bank
 Rate.
 Uh


even
 while
 many
 price
 levels
 remain


elevated,
 the
 reductions
 in
 the
 federal


funds
 rate
 means
 that
 savings
 rates
 or


yields
 to
 be
 more
 precise
 have
 peaked


while
 key
 borrowing
 rates
 remain


elevated.
 And
 that's
 as
 we've
 discussed


here
 as
 many
 Americans
 struggle
 with


liquidity
 or
 emergency
 savings


challenges.
 Is
 that
 just
 collateral


damage
 or
 an
 unintended
 consequence


because
 your
 tools
 are
 limited
 in


addressing
 individual
 or
 household


liquidity
 constraints,
 insufficient


money
 in
 the
 bank?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I
 would
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 um


agree
 that
 that's
 collateral
 damage
 of


our
 of
 our
 um
 I
 mean
 over
 time
 over
 time


we
 do
 what
 we
 do
 in
 order
 to
 create


price
 stability
 and
 maximum
 employment


and
 those
 things
 are
 hugely
 valuable
 to


to
 all
 the
 people
 we
 serve.
 um
 when
 we


raise
 rates
 to
 bring
 inflation
 down,
 you


know,
 that
 does
 work
 by
 slowing
 the


economy,
 but
 we've
 moved
 back
 our
 rate


our
 policy
 back
 down
 to
 where
 it's
 not


it's
 certainly
 not
 strongly
 restrictive


at
 this
 point.
 I
 think
 it's
 sort
 of
 in


the
 range
 of
 neutral.
 Um
 so
 that's
 what


we're
 trying
 to
 do
 and
 uh
 I
 would
 want


people
 to
 understand
 to
 understand
 that


I
 think
 what
 pe
 what
 people
 are
 feeling


is
 the
 effect
 of
 higher
 prices.
 There


was
 a
 global
 wave.
 Sort
 of
 every
 large


economy
 in
 the
 world,
 sort
 every
 every


large
 open
 economy,
 market-based
 economy


in
 the
 world
 had
 a
 wave
 of
 inflation


that
 looked
 an
 awful
 lot
 like
 ours.
 We


actually
 came
 through
 better
 than
 any


other
 country,
 substantially
 better.
 We


had
 higher
 growth.
 We
 had
 better
 labor


market.
 And
 this
 is
 really
 due
 to
 the


American
 economy.
 We
 have
 an


extraordinary
 economy.
 And
 uh
 you
 know,


people
 are
 innovative.
 They
 work
 hard.


And
 uh
 so
 you
 know
 we
 all
 of
 those
 all


of
 us
 who
 work
 in
 economics
 jobs
 are


really
 fortunate
 to
 have
 to
 have
 the
 US


economy.
 So
 thank
 you
 very
 much.


All
 right
 that
 was
 Mr.
 Jpal


for
 the
 December
 FOMC
 meeting
 that
 we


have
 all
 been
 waiting
 for.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 I've
 got
 Neil


who's
 joining
 me
 to
 break
 down
 what


happened
 with
 the
 Fed.
 Also,
 we
 will
 be


transitioning
 right
 into
 the
 market


close
 in
 about
 30
 minutes.
 We
 will
 have


Adobe
 and
 Oracle.
 So,
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 to


talk
 about
 in
 terms
 of
 those
 earnings.


And
 then
 I
 believe
 we'll
 be
 listening
 to


Oracle's
 earnings
 call
 at
 5:00
 PM


Eastern.
 Neil,
 I'll
 just
 give
 you
 the


floor.
 What
 was
 your
 raw
 takeaway
 from


that
 meeting?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 think
 it's
 the
 first
 time
 in
 a


long
 time
 that
 I've
 heard
 a
 dovish


Powell.
 I
 think
 it's
 fair
 to
 say
 it's


been
 it's
 been
 quite
 I
 mean,
 less
 less


bearish
 and
 negative
 and
 quite
 Yeah.


quite
 more
 positive
 on
 AI,
 job
 creation,


the
 economy,
 growth.


Strange.
 Maybe
 maybe
 he
 felt
 the


pressure.
 I
 don't
 know.
 Um
 would
 be


strange
 for
 him
 to
 crack
 6
 months
 before


he's
 anyways
 out
 of
 the
 job.
 So
 I
 guess


even
 with
 the
 missing
 data
 because
 we


didn't
 get
 the
 data
 uh
 because
 of
 the


government
 shutdown
 and
 next
 week
 we


should
 be
 getting
 more
 data.
 He
 seems


comfortable
 saying
 what
 he
 just
 said.
 I


mean,
 a
 25
 basis
 point
 cut
 was
 a
 given.


Let's
 be
 honest.
 Whoever
 whoever
 made


money
 on
 on
 Poly
 Market
 or
 Calia
 from


from
 a
 month
 ago
 when
 this
 thing
 was


50/50,
 congrats.
 Easy
 easy
 money.


But
 yeah,
 I
 mean,
 dovish
 dovish
 Jerome


Powell.
 I
 did
 not
 have
 this
 on
 my
 uh


bingo
 card
 today.
 That's
 for
 sure.


>> Yeah,
 this
 was
 one
 of
 the
 most
 dovish


FOMCs
 that
 we've
 had,
 I
 think,
 all
 year.


And
 the
 consensus
 view
 was
 that
 it
 was


not
 going
 to
 be
 doubbish.
 The
 consensus


view
 was
 that
 this
 one
 was
 going to
 be
 a


hawkish
 cut.
 And
 I
 mean,
 I
 guess
 you
 can


say
 it
 was
 hawkish
 from
 the
 perspective


of
 uh
 they
 aren't
 really
 guaranteeing
 a


rate
 cut
 next
 year.
 They're
 saying
 maybe


one
 cut,
 maybe
 one
 cut
 in
 2027.
 But


folks,
 if
 if
 you
 miss
 some
 of
 the
 key


quotes,
 there's
 two
 major
 quotes
 that
 as


soon
 as
 he
 said
 this,
 I
 mean,
 we
 were


going
 up,
 we
 were
 going
 down,
 we
 were


going
 up,
 we
 were
 going
 down.
 The
 next


30
 minutes
 is
 really
 going
 to
 define
 how


the
 market
 thinks
 of
 it.
 3:30
 to
 4
 p.m.


Eastern
 is
 when
 we
 really
 see
 what
 the


market
 thinks.
 As
 soon
 as
 he
 said
 this,


which
 is
 a
 bit
 of a
 summary,
 but


essentially
 the
 gist
 of
 what
 he
 said
 is


inflation
 is
 coming
 in
 lower
 and
 tariffs


may
 not
 be
 running
 the
 economy
 hot.


That's
 when
 we
 saw
 the
 S&P
 make
 a
 move.


We
 got
 all
 the
 way
 up
 to
 68850,
 which
 is


very
 close
 to
 68970,
 which
 is
 our


all-time
 high.
 Obviously,
 a
 lot
 of
 us


are
 seeing,
 can
 we
 break
 that
 all-time


high?
 Right
 now,
 we're
 at
 688.
 And
 then


after
 that
 he
 said
 if
 we
 didn't
 have


tariffs
 inflation
 would
 be
 in
 the
 low


twos
 which
 is
 part
 of
 the
 Fed's
 target


2%.
 And
 then
 he
 said
 but
 we
 think


tariffs
 are
 a
 onetime
 thing.
 So
 he
 said


hey
 tariffs
 are
 the
 issue
 which
 is
 why


we've
 had
 so
 much
 inflation.
 Without


tariffs
 we
 wouldn't
 have
 any
 of
 this


inflation
 concern
 but
 we
 also
 think


tariffs
 are
 not
 running
 the
 economy
 hot.


We
 think
 tariffs
 are
 not
 going
 to
 be
 the


biggest
 thing.
 Essentially
 he
 said


tariffs
 are
 transitory
 without
 saying


they're
 transitory.
 And
 that's
 when
 the


market
 really
 got
 excited
 because
 if


he's
 right
 about
 that
 or
 at least
 the


perception
 is
 that
 the
 Fed
 is
 not


assuming
 that
 tariffs
 are
 going to
 be
 as


big
 of
 a
 deal
 going
 into
 2026
 and
 you've


got
 the
 labor
 market
 continuing
 to


weaken.
 They
 can
 say
 we're
 only
 going
 to


cut
 once
 in
 2026,
 but
 it's
 kind
 of


obvious
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 cut
 only


once.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 market
 is
 pricing


that
 in
 right
 now
 and
 that's
 why
 we're


getting
 some
 of
 this
 momentum.
 Neil,
 any


thoughts
 on
 what
 he
 said
 about
 inflation


and
 I
 guess
 how
 that
 relates
 to
 to


tariffs
 in
 the
 labor
 market?


I
 mean
 I
 the
 last
 time
 he
 used
 I
 mean


the
 last
 time
 they
 said
 transitory


didn't
 work
 out
 for
 them.
 Um
 this
 time
 I


mean
 I
 guess
 tariffs
 for
 now
 I
 if
 we
 go


back
 to
 what
 was
 mentioned
 back
 in
 April


or
 maybe
 March
 and
 April
 so
 far
 they


have
 not
 destroyed
 the
 economy.


Inflation
 has
 not
 soared
 to
 to
 five
 6
 7


8%.


So
 so
 far
 I
 guess
 so
 good.
 the
 it's
 not


as
 bad
 as
 expected
 could
 get
 much
 better


in
 2026
 as
 we
 lap
 these
 let's
 say


difficult
 uh
 periods
 tariffs
 are
 or
 the


effects
 of
 it
 are
 probably
 going
 to
 go


away
 because
 even
 even
 today
 we
 are
 not


at
 the
 same
 rates
 as
 before
 uh
 they've


been
 adjusted
 down
 still
 waiting
 for


some
 deal
 with
 China
 I
 don't
 know
 when


that's
 supposed
 to
 happen
 but
 I
 guess
 it


will
 happen
 eventually
 um
 on
 a
 broader


broader
 deal
 But
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 I
 was
 I


was
 quite
 surprised
 with
 some
 some
 of


the
 questions
 of
 people
 saying,
 "Oh,
 now


now
 now
 you
 are
 paying
 more
 attention
 to


the
 job
 market.
 Why
 you
 why
 you
 paying


less
 attention
 to
 inflation?"
 And
 I
 was


like,
 "Guys,
 are
 you
 seriously
 talking


about
 why
 he's
 paying
 more
 attention
 to


one,
 also
 the
 housing
 market,
 which
 has


been
 has
 been
 crushed
 for
 the
 last


couple
 of
 years,
 and
 two,
 making
 sure


that
 people
 are


having
 the
 option
 to
 get
 a
 job
 or
 not


get
 laid
 off
 and
 still
 focus
 on


inflation,
 but
 maybe
 a
 little
 bit
 less."


And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Well,
 what
 kind
 of
 a


stupid
 question
 is
 that?"
 Didn't
 I


didn't
 make
 much
 sense
 to
 me.


>> No,
 I
 agree.
 And
 uh
 we're
 going
 to
 hear


from
 Jeffrey
 Gunlock
 in
 a
 minute
 who


again
 has
 been
 kind
 of
 ringing
 the
 bell


about
 how
 the
 bond
 market
 is
 going
 to


have
 a
 very
 big
 issue
 next
 year.
 Um
 I


think
 even
 he
 would
 have
 to
 admit
 that


inflation
 at
 least
 from
 the
 perspective


of
 Pal
 is
 not
 as
 aggressive
 as
 an
 issue


as
 the
 market
 might
 have
 been
 pricing
 in


going
 into
 this
 print.
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


people
 thought
 Pal
 was
 going
 to
 say
 look


we
 gave
 you
 the
 cut
 today
 next
 year
 we


have
 concerns
 around
 inflation
 that's


why
 you
 know
 there
 was
 all
 this


hesitation
 in
 November.
 I
 mean,
 in


literally
 in
 November,
 Nvidia
 was
 up
 500


billion
 in
 market
 cap
 after
 earnings


came
 right
 back
 down
 based
 on
 Fed
 talk,


based
 on
 not
 the
 Fed
 chair,
 not
 the
 the


person
 who's
 very
 close
 to
 the
 Fed
 chair


like
 John
 Williams
 in
 the
 New
 York
 Fed,


but
 just
 a
 random
 Fed
 president
 from


Cleveland
 saying
 that
 she
 thinks
 maybe


inflation
 is
 an
 issue.
 And
 Nvidia
 fell


500
 billion
 market
 cap
 and
 one.
 I
 mean,


so
 you
 had
 all
 this
 Fed
 talk
 in
 November


creating
 fears
 about
 inflation,
 which


begged
 the
 question
 for
 us
 on
 the
 show


to
 do
 a
 lot
 more
 research
 about
 the


labor
 market
 versus
 inflation.
 And
 based


on
 what
 we
 just
 heard
 over
 the
 past
 40


minutes,
 it's
 almost
 like
 JPAL
 doesn't


really
 have
 that
 many
 concerns
 about


inflation,
 which
 would
 be,
 I
 think,
 a


180
 going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 You


talk
 about
 a
 perfect
 setup
 for
 a
 Santa


Claus
 rally.
 That's
 it.
 If
 we
 don't
 get


the
 Santa
 Claus
 rally
 after
 that,
 then


it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 But
 you
 could
 not
 have


asked
 Pal
 to
 be
 friendlier
 to
 the
 bulls


in
 that
 FOMC
 by
 being
 as
 doubbish
 as


possible
 on
 the
 concept
 of
 inflation
 not


being
 a
 concern.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 why


we're
 getting
 some
 momentum
 right
 here.


Robin
 Hood
 at
 137.
 Bitcoin
 almost
 had


94.
 We
 did
 touch
 it
 for
 a
 little
 bit.


Ethereum
 3,400.
 BMR,
 it
 has
 been
 very


volatile
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 that
 got
 into


this
 name.
 Basic
 around
 the
 40
 to
 50


range.
 Um
 Q
 all
 the
 way
 back
 down
 to
 24.


Now
 we're
 right
 back
 at
 41.5.
 So
 not
 too


bad.
 That's
 up
 5.7%.
 Rocket
 Lab,
 a
 lot


of
 talk
 about
 data
 centers
 in
 space.


That's
 up
 8.9%
 of
 the
 day.
 Grab
 goes


green.


>> Can
 we
 talk
 about
 the
 data
 center
 in


space
 thing?


>> Yeah,
 let's
 talk
 about
 it.
 And
 Nvidia


still
 can't
 go
 green.
 Even
 though
 if


we're
 building
 data
 centers
 in
 space,


we're
 going
 to
 need
 some
 Nvidia
 GPUs.


So,
 what
 are
 your
 thoughts
 on
 on
 that


entire
 idea?


>> No,
 I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 crazy
 how
 fast


these
 things
 they
 we
 first
 heard
 about


it.
 I
 think
 uh
 Jose
 talked
 about
 it
 a


month
 or
 so
 ago
 when
 uh
 when
 they
 sent


H100s
 to
 space,
 but
 there
 was
 also
 that


podcast
 with
 uh
 Gavin
 Baker,
 I
 think
 on


uh
 Oshanes's
 podcast
 and
 and
 he
 talks


about
 the
 fact
 that


>> energy,
 okay,
 you're
 closer
 to
 the
 sun,


so
 you
 get
 energy,
 but
 he
 talks


especially
 about
 the
 the
 cooling
 aspect,


the
 fact
 that
 on
 Earth,
 um
 all
 of
 these


servers,
 right,
 that
 they're
 built
 so


they
 and
 cool
 the
 GPUs
 much
 faster.
 Air


cooled,
 liquid
 cooled,
 and
 in
 space,


well,
 it's
 freezing
 in
 space.
 So,
 so


it's
 much
 easier.
 But
 I
 I
 I
 did
 some


some
 LLM
 digging
 here.
 Not
 not
 digging


in
 books.
 I
 I
 just
 asked
 some
 questions


because
 it
 did
 not
 make
 that
 much
 sense


because
 you're
 in
 a
 vacuum
 in
 space
 and


so
 it
 should
 be
 more
 difficult


to
 cool
 things
 down
 in
 space.
 There
 is


no
 there
 is
 no
 air
 in
 in
 in
 space.
 And


so
 what
 what
 are
 you
 going
 to
 do?


Apparently
 the
 only
 way
 to
 shed
 heat
 in


space
 is
 via
 thermal
 radiation,
 infrared


light.
 And
 this
 apparently
 is
 extremely


slow
 and
 inefficient.
 So
 you're
 not


going,
 you're
 telling
 me
 that
 on
 Earth


we're
 doing
 liquid
 cooling,
 air
 cooling,


which
 apparently
 is
 very
 efficient


compared
 to
 what
 other
 alternatives


there
 are.
 But
 in
 space,
 which
 you
 are


again,
 you
 are
 in
 a
 vacuum.
 So
 you're


you're
 not
 having
 you
 don't
 have
 air


that
 you're
 you
 can
 blow
 into
 these


GPUs.
 And
 if
 you
 are
 still
 going
 to
 use


liquid
 then
 then
 what's
 the
 like
 what's


what's
 the
 point
 here?
 Um
 so
 there
 there


might
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 hype
 right
 now
 with


data
 centers
 in
 space.
 I'm
 pretty
 sure


it's
 going
 to
 happen
 anyways.
 But
 I


think
 it's
 also
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 why
 a


lot
 of
 these
 small
 neo
 cloud
 players
 are


down
 a
 lot
 today.
 The
 core
 etc
 etc.


>> I
 didn't
 even
 think
 of
 that.
 Of
 course,


if
 if
 there's
 d
 I
 mean,
 it's
 such
 a


absurd
 if
 there's
 data
 centers
 in
 space,


then
 yeah,
 Nebius
 and
 Cororeweave
 don't


matter.
 Wow.
 That
 that
 that
 really
 could


be
 the
 reason.


>> I
 mean,
 the
 are
 we
 going
 to
 have
 huge


gigawatt
 data
 centers
 in
 space
 tomorrow?


No,
 but
 the
 market
 is
 always
 like,
 okay,


you
 know
 what?
 Let's
 dump
 things
 and


then
 let's
 see
 if
 it
 actually
 makes
 any


sense.
 And
 it
 it
 doesn't
 make
 any
 sense


because
 I
 mean
 are
 we
 going
 to
 ship
 data


centers
 into
 rockets
 tomorrow
 or
 even


next
 year
 or
 even
 the
 next
 two
 years?


The
 the
 answer
 to
 me
 is
 no.
 Are
 we
 going


to
 have
 data
 centers
 in
 space
 in
 the


2030s?
 Yes,
 probably.
 Probably.
 But


until
 the
 2030s,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 smaller,


let's
 say,
 data
 center
 companies
 or
 or


neoclouds
 are
 going
 to
 have
 gigawatts


worth
 of
 compute
 running
 through
 them.


So
 overreaction
 from
 the
 market
 as


always
 in
 my
 opinion
 and
 uh
 data
 center


in
 space.
 I
 mean,
 okay,
 cool.
 But
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 happen
 anytime


soon.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 the
 other
 reason


people
 are
 getting
 excited
 about
 this
 is


because
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 reported


that
 Elon
 is
 touting
 this
 as
 the
 next


phase
 of
 growth
 for
 uh
 selling
 SpaceX


stock
 to
 new
 investors
 that
 are
 trying


to
 get
 in
 at
 a
 maybe
 800
 maybe
 $1


trillion
 valuation.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 Elon's


tweeted
 multiple
 things
 over
 the
 past
 24


hours
 about
 data
 centers
 in
 space.


Sundar's
 tweeting
 about
 it.
 Maybe


collectively
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


starting
 to
 recognize
 this
 could
 be
 a


next
 growth
 vector.
 Although,
 as
 Neil


says,
 there's
 probably
 a
 lot
 of


challenges
 that
 are
 going
 to
 be
 needed


to
 to
 ultimately
 get
 there.
 Bitcoin


right
 now
 93.5.
 Small
 caps,
 I
 think


that's
 an
 all-time
 high.
 January
 is


really
 good
 for
 the
 small
 caps.
 Yep,


that
 is
 an
 all-time
 high.
 256
 on
 our


small
 caps.
 S&P
 she's
 so
 close.
 68970


less
 than
 a
 dollar
 away
 to
 get
 to


alltime
 highs.
 And
 you
 know,
 just
 even


if
 we
 get
 there
 and
 then
 we
 fade
 a


little
 lower,
 psychologically
 breaking


that
 all-time
 high
 after
 the
 past
 five


weeks
 we've
 all
 been
 through,
 including


the
 November
 downturn,
 uh
 that'd
 be
 a


big
 deal.
 That'd
 be
 a
 very
 big
 deal.
 And


you
 know,
 690
 to
 7,000
 might
 be
 on
 the


way
 if
 it
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 Bitcoin


right
 there
 93.6,
 Ethereum
 at
 3,400,


Robin
 Hood
 at
 137.
 Microsoft
 still
 down


on
 the
 day.
 These
 Max
 7
 names
 still


getting
 disrespected.
 Amazon
 uh
 making
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 move
 at
 232.
 Nvidia
 and


Microsoft
 are
 down.
 Tesla
 I
 think
 got
 to


455.
 There
 you
 go.
 45595.


That
 is
 green.
 Um
 Apple,
 are
 we
 at
 280?


We
 are
 at
 279.
 And
 then
 Meta
 was
 down
 in


the
 morning.
 Meta
 right
 there
 649.
 So


Meta,
 uh,
 Nvidia
 and
 Microsoft
 not


really
 making
 a
 move
 as
 the
 market
 is


moving
 higher.
 Google
 is
 moving
 up
 at


320.
 Healthcare
 is
 getting
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 bit.
 So
 you're
 seeing
 some
 of
 that


rotation
 into
 other
 things
 along
 with


small
 caps
 which
 are
 propping
 up
 the


market
 right
 here
 as
 we
 are
 trying
 to


push
 for
 that
 all-time
 high.
 Tesla
 right


there
 at
 455


80
 as
 well.
 Uh,
 let's
 get
 to
 Jeffrey


Gunlock
 again.
 He
 uh
 caused
 a
 lot
 of
 I


guess
 concern
 in
 November.
 He's
 been
 a


prominent
 bond
 investor
 speaking
 about


how
 the
 bond
 market
 is
 not
 healthy.


Let's
 get
 his
 take
 on
 what
 he
 thought


JPEL
 said
 in
 that
 meeting.


>> From
 the
 tips
 versus
 nominal
 treasury


market,
 which
 is
 appropriate.
 He's
 right


about
 that.
 That's
 been
 extremely
 well


contained
 in
 the
 mid
 twos
 for
 quite
 some


time.
 So
 he
 says
 he's
 well
 positioned,


but
 we're
 he
 really
 emphasized
 things


like
 well
 maybe
 you
 know
 inflation
 will


tick
 up
 because
 of
 jobs
 uh
 you
 know


being
 in
 demand
 or
 something
 but
 I
 don't


expect
 that
 to
 happen.
 He
 he
 went
 out
 of


his
 way
 to
 frame
 inflation
 as
 less
 of
 a


problem.
 He
 even
 went
 so
 far
 as
 to
 say


they're
 making
 good
 progress
 on


inflation
 if
 it
 weren't
 for
 those
 darn


tariffs,
 you
 know.
 So
 he's
 he's
 he's


trying
 to
 carve
 out
 some
 real
 estate
 for


himself
 on
 on
 these
 things.
 But
 when
 he


says
 he's
 well
 positioned,
 I
 really


agree
 with
 him
 because
 at
 long
 last,
 the


Fed
 funds
 rate
 is
 the
 same
 as
 the
 2-year


Treasury
 yield.
 It's
 fascinating
 that


the
 Fed
 has
 dropped
 rates
 175
 basis


points


beginning
 sego,
 September,
 but
 the


two-year
 Treasury
 rate
 is
 completely


unchanged.
 So
 175
 basis
 point
 drop
 in
 in


Fed
 funds
 has
 finally
 gotten
 it
 back


down
 in
 line
 with
 the
 two-year.
 So
 I


think
 he
 is
 well
 positioned
 and
 he
 seems


pretty
 clearly
 focused
 more
 on
 the


employment
 risk
 of
 unemployment
 rising


than
 he
 is
 on
 inflation
 being
 a
 problem.


So
 I
 don't
 I
 think
 this
 was
 sold
 uh
 you


was
 kind
 of
 sold
 to
 be
 expected
 to
 be
 a


hawkish
 cut
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 was.


And
 when
 you
 when
 you
 ladle
 on
 top
 of


the
 the
 cut
 and
 the
 language
 surrounding


it
 with
 the
 40
 billion
 of
 what
 some


people
 will
 call
 QE,
 I
 mean
 that's
 kind


of
 interesting.
 We've
 been
 we've
 been


doing
 QT
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and
 all
 of a


sudden
 out
 of
 the
 blue
 we've
 we've


ramped
 up
 QE,
 which
 is
 probably
 giving


people
 some
 hope
 that
 there's
 going
 to


be
 QE
 if
 needed.
 And
 I
 suspect
 that
 is


going
 to
 be
 the
 case.
 One
 thing
 that's


fascinating
 is
 that
 people
 keep
 talking


about
 the
 Fed
 cutting
 rates
 to
 help


housing.
 Well,
 the
 Fed
 cutting
 rates
 175


basis
 points
 has
 not
 helped
 housing.


What's
 happened
 is
 that
 long-term


interest
 rates
 have
 risen
 as
 the
 Fed
 has


cut
 rates
 175
 basis
 points.
 The
 long


bond,
 the
 30-year
 Treasury
 is
 up
 about


75
 basis
 points


since
 before
 they
 started
 cutting
 rates.


And
 the
 10-year
 Treasury
 rate
 is
 up
 as


well.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 I
 continue
 to
 believe
 and


this
 has
 been
 my
 thesis
 since
 they


started
 cutting
 rates
 and
 the
 market


action
 seems
 to
 have
 corroborated
 my


view
 that
 the
 Fed
 cutting
 interest
 rates


is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 helpful
 for
 long-term


interest
 rates.
 So
 today
 we
 had
 the
 Fed


cut
 and
 the
 curve
 steepened
 again.
 We're


out
 to
 2's
 30s
 out
 to
 about
 123
 124


basis
 points.
 The


>> we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 how
 that


plays
 out
 going
 into
 2025.
 Obviously


there
 has
 been
 uh
 a
 mismatch
 in
 the


market
 which
 is
 that
 we
 have
 cut
 rates


but
 interest
 rates
 mortgage
 rates
 etc


haven't
 really
 declined.
 Neil
 any


thoughts
 on
 that
 idea
 that
 although
 we


are
 being
 dovish
 the
 credit
 market
 is


not
 really
 cooperating
 especially
 the


10ear
 which
 is
 barely
 down
 on
 the
 day.


>> Um
 I'll
 say
 honestly
 I'm
 not
 a
 bonds


experts
 or
 anything
 like
 that.
 So
 I


don't
 know
 it
 has
 been
 doing
 some
 crazy


things
 year
 to
 date.
 We've
 had
 we've


seen
 it
 go
 under
 four
 then
 it
 goes
 back


over
 four.
 I
 mean
 it
 was
 under
 four
 what


two
 three
 weeks
 ago.


>> We're
 just
 under
 four


>> and
 now
 we're
 back
 at
 uh
 I
 think
 this


morning
 or
 yesterday
 was
 what
 4.2.
 So


again
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 low
 right
 now.


People
 were
 expecting
 it
 to
 to
 spike


actually
 after
 after
 today.
 So
 it's
 a


bit
 all
 over
 the
 place
 for
 now.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


POW
 uh
 rate
 cut
 probabilities
 right
 now,


January,
 I
 said
 POW
 rate
 cut,
 I
 meant


Fed
 rate
 cut,
 but
 POW
 is
 still
 the
 Fed


chair.
 January's
 at
 24%,
 March
 is
 at
 46,


April's
 at
 60,
 June's
 at
 87.
 So,
 you


have
 that
 June
 cut
 that's
 being
 priced


in.
 But
 the
 first
 three
 months
 of
 the


year,
 markets
 putting
 a
 less
 than
 a
 50%


chance
 until
 April
 that
 we
 even
 get
 a


rate
 cut.
 And
 maybe
 if
 the
 bond
 market


cooperates
 and
 we
 get
 yields
 to
 come


down,
 you
 get
 yourself
 set
 up
 for
 a
 very


strong
 2026.
 The
 way
 to
 do
 that
 is
 for


the
 bond
 market
 to
 not
 be
 afraid
 of


inflation.
 Pal
 did
 his
 best
 to
 frame


over
 the
 past
 hour
 that
 inflation
 isn't


the
 concern
 and
 that
 it's
 only
 tariffs


that
 are
 causing
 it,
 but
 it's
 going
 to


be
 up
 to
 the
 bond
 bond
 market
 to
 decide


that
 going
 into
 next
 year.
 ESTs
 10%
 on


the
 day.
 Absolutely
 incredible.
 Rocket


Lab,
 that's
 up
 9%.
 It
 was
 at
 5837.


Um
 again
 a
 lot
 of these
 space
 names


getting
 some
 momentum
 based
 on
 this
 data


center
 argument.
 BMR
 is
 moving.
 Silver


is
 at
 62.
 BMR
 right
 there
 4152.
 Silver


the
 running
 commodities
 has
 been
 I
 mean


just
 incredible.
 6177.
 Gold
 is
 up
 about


half
 a
 percent
 as
 well.
 So
 you're
 seeing


a
 lot
 of
 that
 move
 continue
 to
 take


place
 along
 with
 the
 broader
 stock


market.
 Uh
 Trump
 is
 live
 as
 well.
 He


announced
 a
 couple
 things.
 Number
 one
 is


this
 gold
 card
 and
 platinum
 card.
 gold


card
 for
 a
 processing
 fee
 and
 a
 $1


million
 contribution.
 You
 will
 receive


US
 residency
 in
 record
 time
 with
 the


Trump
 gold
 card.
 With
 the
 platinum
 card,


you
 have
 to
 pay
 5
 million.
 You
 have
 the


ability
 to
 spend
 up
 to
 270
 days
 in
 the


United
 States
 without
 being
 subject
 to


US
 taxes
 on
 non
 US
 income.


We've
 heard
 about
 this
 uh
 gold
 card
 for


a
 while
 now.
 I
 think
 like
 they
 announced


it
 five
 different
 times.
 I
 guess
 this
 is


like
 their
 official
 big
 announcement.


Uh,
 but
 if
 you
 got
 a
 million
 dollars
 or


$5
 million,
 I
 guess
 you
 can
 come
 to
 the


United
 States.
 Neil,
 any
 Neil,
 you're


going
 to
 shell
 out
 a
 million
 to
 to
 live


here
 now?


>> Yeah.
 I
 need
 PayPal
 to
 move
 up.


Yes.
 Once
 PayPal
 moves
 up,
 we'll
 get


Neil
 to
 the
 States.
 Here's
 Trump
 Live.


Let's
 see
 what
 he's
 talking
 about
 here


as
 well.


>> Whatever
 you
 want
 to
 call
 it,
 license.


They
 paid
 nothing
 and
 you
 know
 we


they're
 paying
 now.
 They're
 paying
 a


fair
 amount.
 I
 had
 them
 at
 39%.


But
 I
 decided
 to
 be
 nice.
 I
 was
 nice
 and


I
 think
 they
 like
 us
 a
 little
 bit


better.
 But
 the
 money
 you're
 talking


about
 is
 enormous.
 Our
 country
 is
 a
 very


rich
 country.
 But
 if
 we
 do
 well,
 the


market
 should
 go
 up
 and
 the
 value
 of
 our


country
 should
 go
 up.
 And
 if
 we
 do


poorly,
 the
 market
 then
 should
 go
 down.


It
 shouldn't
 be
 the
 opposite.
 And
 if
 we


go
 up,
 we
 should
 encourage
 it
 to
 go
 up


more.
 And
 those
 numbers
 when
 you
 say,


you
 know,
 3%
 of
 GDP
 or
 4%
 of
 GDP,
 they


should
 be
 much
 higher.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I


wanted
 to
 say
 it.
 I
 do
 say
 it.
 I
 believe


it.
 And
 we
 have
 to
 get
 a
 mindset
 that


when
 a
 country
 is
 doing
 well,
 you
 don't


want
 to
 kill
 the
 growth.
 That's
 what


they're
 doing.
 They
 kill
 the
 growth.
 I


don't
 know if
 you
 guys
 even
 agree
 with


that.
 They
 kill
 the
 growth
 because


they're
 so
 afraid
 of
 inflation.
 But
 you


can
 have
 tremendous
 growth
 without


inflation.
 Every
 everything
 goes
 up
 with


the
 growth.
 But
 that's
 not
 inflation.


So
 I
 think
 we
 can
 do
 much
 better.
 All


right.
 That's
 what
 you
 got
 from
 Trump.


So
 that
 is
 the
 coverage
 on
 FOMC.
 We'll


transition
 here
 to
 Oracle
 and
 Adobe.
 But


I
 mean
 ultimately
 guys,
 you
 know,
 Neil


and
 I
 are
 analyzing
 this
 stuff
 day
 in


and
 day
 out.
 We
 are
 reading
 a
 lot
 of


stuff,
 watching
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff,
 trying


to
 understand
 what's
 going
 on.
 I
 can't


see
 how
 this
 is
 bearish.
 Does
 the
 stock


price
 action
 across
 the
 entire
 market


have
 to
 reflect
 a
 bullish
 point
 of
 view?


No,
 because
 the
 markets
 are
 the
 markets.


They
 are
 right
 now,
 which
 is
 very
 nice.


But
 like
 objectively,
 that
 was
 not
 a


hawkish
 cut.
 There's
 not
 many
 statements


we
 can
 go
 to
 to
 explain
 that
 was


hawkish.
 What
 was
 hawkish
 was
 anyone
 who


actually
 bet
 on
 JPL
 saying
 the
 word


Trump.
 I
 told
 you
 guys
 he
 doesn't
 like


Trump.
 He
 wasn't
 gonna
 say
 it.
 So,
 he


said
 a
 lot
 of
 things,
 but
 for
 those
 that


wasted
 15
 cents
 thinking
 that
 he
 was


going
 to
 say
 Trump
 or
 soft
 landing,
 I


didn't
 think
 he
 would
 say
 that
 either.


Stagflation,
 gold,
 national
 debt,
 egg,


trade
 war,
 stable
 coin,
 yield
 curve,


recession.
 He
 didn't
 say
 the
 rword,


consumer
 confidence.
 He
 didn't
 say
 any


of
 that
 stuff.
 He
 did
 say
 tariff.
 He
 did


say
 shutdown,
 restrictive,
 balance


sheet,
 good
 afternoon.


Dude,
 I
 think
 you
 could
 bet
 on
 that
 at


94
 cents.
 You
 got
 paid
 a
 dollar.
 That's


a
 6%
 return
 on
 betting
 that
 he
 would
 say


good
 afternoon.
 It's
 quite
 incredible.


But
 yeah,
 I
 I
 think
 what
 was
 really


hawkish
 was
 uh
 the
 perception
 coming


into
 this
 cut,
 not
 the
 actual
 cut
 or
 the


meeting
 itself,
 which
 was
 quite


incredible.


>> Um
 Oracle
 Neil,
 what
 are
 your
 thoughts?


And
 do
 you
 think
 this
 stock
 can
 pump


today?


>> I
 mean,
 it's
 it
 is
 now
 up
 20%
 or
 so
 I'm


seeing
 from
 the
 lows.
 Not
 obviously
 not


today
 from
 the
 lows.
 It's
 it
 should
 have


never
 been
 um
 it
 should
 have
 never
 been


at
 340
 or
 or
 something
 like
 that.


Anyways,
 it's
 I
 mean
 we
 were
 I
 think
 I


think
 I
 was
 here
 as
 well
 3
 months
 ago


when
 the
 big
 RPO
 number
 came
 out
 and


they
 said
 we
 can't
 even
 or
 we
 are


probably
 going
 to
 see
 half
 a
 trillion


dollars
 in
 RPO
 etc
 etc
 and
 they
 gave
 us


some
 revenue
 projections
 which
 okay
 that


will
 happen
 in
 the
 next
 four
 years
 or
 so


that
 was
 fine
 and
 of
 course
 since
 then
 a


lot
 of
 things
 have
 happened
 Samman


didn't
 want
 to
 answer
 a
 specific


question
 um


default
 swaps
 are
 are
 rising
 for
 uh
 for


Oracle,
 for
 coreweave.
 There
 are
 lots
 of


questions
 about
 it
 this
 whole
 ecosystem.


Okay,
 fine.
 Today
 I
 think
 the
 focus


should
 be
 way
 more
 on
 the
 short-term


success
 of
 the
 business
 and
 it
 will
 be


way
 less
 on
 the
 5
 10
 years
 uh
 road
 map


that
 they
 are
 putting
 out
 there
 with


with
 their
 RPO
 because
 again
 the
 RPO
 is


not
 a
 contract.
 um
 it's
 not
 100%
 certain


that
 they're
 going
 to
 recognize
 the


whole
 $400
 and
 something
 billion
 dollars


or
 so
 over
 the
 next
 four
 years.
 So
 the


market
 is
 probably
 going
 to
 see
 okay
 you


know what
 you
 gave
 us
 revenue
 guidance


but
 but
 what
 about
 actual
 profitability


because
 they
 don't
 have
 the
 free
 cash


flow
 for
 the
 whole
 for
 all
 of
 the


projects
 they
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 debt.
 So


that's
 probably
 what
 the
 market
 is
 is


looking
 for
 some
 answers
 with
 regards
 to


that.
 Um
 and
 that
 might
 also
 help
 a
 lot


of
 the
 other
 smaller
 players.
 Maybe
 that


will
 move
 Nvidia
 because
 Nvidia


literally
 doesn't
 move
 as
 of
 as
 of
 right


now.
 It's
 one
 of
 those
 names
 that
 that


is
 down
 to
 flatish
 plus
 all
 the


Neoclouds.
 Um
 so
 yeah,
 I
 I
 think


revenue-wise
 I
 think
 they'll
 beat
 right.


I
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 the
 estimates
 the


assumptions
 are
 are
 that
 crazy.


But
 the
 whole
 I
 think
 the
 whole
 earnings


call
 will
 just
 be
 focused
 on
 how
 are
 you


actually
 going
 to
 achieve
 all
 of
 this?
 I


mean,
 you
 gave
 us
 crazy
 amounts
 of


revenue
 for
 for
 the
 next
 four
 years,
 but


it's
 going
 to
 cost
 you
 and
 and
 how
 do


you
 fund
 all
 of
 these
 things?
 Hopefully,


they
 have
 an
 answer.


Yeah,
 and
 we'll
 talk
 about
 Adobe
 in
 a


second.
 I
 agree.
 I
 am
 not
 taking
 an


earnings
 earnings
 play
 on
 this
 one.
 Let


me
 know
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 anyone
 is.
 Um,
 I


am
 just
 worried
 that
 there's
 not
 going


to
 be
 that
 monumental
 358%
 revenue


growth
 or
 um
 RPO
 growth
 and
 they're
 not


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 announce
 that


massive
 new
 cloud
 computing
 contract.


the
 the
 reason
 the
 stock
 pumped
 to
 350


in
 a
 day,
 which
 was
 insanity,
 um
 was


because
 Oracle
 said
 they
 increased
 RPO


by
 300
 billion
 because
 there
 was
 one


client
 who
 ended
 up
 saying,
 "Hey,


Oracle,
 we'll
 give
 you
 300
 billion."


That
 client
 ended
 up
 being
 the
 worst


possible
 client
 you
 could
 tell
 the


market,
 especially
 after
 Mr.
 Sam
 Alman's


interview
 that
 yeah,
 these
 guys
 want
 to


give
 us
 300
 billion.
 It
 was
 OpenAI
 and


we
 all
 know
 OpenAI
 doesn't
 have
 the


money.
 Now,
 maybe
 one
 day
 they'll
 have


the
 money.
 Maybe
 they'll
 keep
 growing


fast
 enough
 to
 get
 the
 money.
 But
 you


talk
 about
 Sam
 Alman
 issuing
 code
 reds


because
 he's
 afraid
 that
 Chachm
 is
 going


to
 stop
 growing
 because
 of
 Gemini.
 Next


thing
 you
 know,
 the
 1.4
 trillion
 in


spending
 they
 committed
 for
 Nvidia,
 AMD,


Oracle.
 I
 mean,
 even
 Nvidia
 on
 their


earnings
 call
 explicitly
 said
 we
 don't


have
 a
 definitive
 agreement
 set
 in
 place


with
 OpenAI.
 So,
 the
 market
 is
 very
 well


to
 discount
 Oracle
 not
 only
 for
 the
 40


billion
 debt
 that
 they've
 issued,
 which


is
 why
 the
 credit
 default
 swaps
 have


been
 rising
 dramatically,
 which
 is


normal,
 right?
 Not
 necessarily
 bearish.


is
 just
 a
 hedge
 against
 that
 debt.
 But


two,
 because
 they
 just
 can't
 trust
 that


they're
 actually
 going
 to
 get
 paid
 back.


So
 if
 Oracle
 doesn't
 have
 that
 type
 of


number
 on
 this
 call,
 or
 Oracle
 might
 end


up
 saying
 something
 more
 about
 negative


free
 cash
 flow
 with
 the
 financing
 of
 the


debt,
 like
 something
 that
 is
 just


generally
 not
 the
 most
 exciting
 in
 the


short
 term.
 Maybe
 it
 pays
 dividends
 in


the
 future,
 but
 not
 right
 now.
 You
 know,


maybe
 the
 stock
 tanks
 now.
 Maybe
 it


stays
 flat,
 but
 if
 you're
 buying
 options


or
 something,
 right,
 you
 got
 to
 you
 got


to
 get
 a
 big
 move
 on
 this.
 Google
 right


there
 at
 321.
 So
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 what


happens
 with
 Oracle.
 This
 is
 going to
 be


a
 monumental
 earnings.
 I
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 going
 to
 have
 the
 biggest
 impact
 on


the
 market,
 but
 because
 they
 are


collateral
 damage
 from
 this
 whole
 OpenAI


fallout
 that
 the
 market
 is
 having,


having
 them
 kind
 of
 stabilize
 the
 trust


in
 OpenAI,
 I
 think
 would
 be
 very


important.
 Um,
 Adobe
 Neil,
 you
 actually


went
 to
 Adobe's
 conference
 in
 LA,
 so


congratulations
 on
 that.
 That
 was
 super


super
 awesome
 stuff.
 What
 are
 your


thoughts
 on
 Adobe
 after
 the
 bell
 today?


>> Well,
 that's
 the
 complete
 opposite.
 It


has
 zero
 expectations
 valuation
 wise
 is


is
 very
 cheap.
 Again,
 I
 don't
 own
 Adobe,


but
 I
 do
 I
 do
 cover
 it.
 I
 think
 I
 mean
 I


I
 use
 their
 services.
 It's
 very
 cheap.


It
 is
 actually
 a
 very
 profitable


company.
 Again,
 we
 just
 talked
 about


Oracle.
 There's
 no
 free
 cash
 flow
 with


Adobe.
 There
 is
 plenty
 of
 free
 cash


flow.
 High
 margin
 business
 buying
 back


quite
 a
 lot
 of
 shares.
 But
 for
 them
 it's


oh
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 disrupt
 and
 destroy


the
 Adobe
 Creative
 Cloud
 ecosystem.


Today
 we've
 actually
 had
 an
 announcement


that
 Adobe
 Photoshop
 Express
 and
 Acrobat


are
 going
 to
 be
 integrated
 into
 Chat


GPT.
 They
 already
 had
 a
 sort
 of
 uh
 Chat


GPT
 let's
 say
 partnership
 or
 semi


integration
 with
 regards
 to
 uh
 um


imaging


but
 they
 have
 that
 with
 um
 Gemini.


They've
 had
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 go
 on
 Firefly,


Adobe
 Firefly,
 you
 can
 use
 third
 party


models.
 It's
 not
 just
 Firefly
 models.


You
 can
 use
 Gemini,
 you
 can
 use
 Runway,


Black
 Forest,
 you
 you
 name
 it.
 So


they've
 been
 doing
 they've
 been
 doing


what
 they
 should
 be
 doing.
 My
 biggest


let's
 say
 bare
 case
 for
 Adobe
 was
 and


still
 is
 if
 they
 don't
 move
 fast
 enough,


they
 will
 give
 their
 users
 reasons
 to


leave
 the
 Adobe
 ecosystem
 towards


something
 else.
 As
 long
 as
 they
 innovate


and
 move
 fast
 and
 have
 partner
 models,


have
 everything
 that
 creators
 need,


they're
 not
 giving
 a
 reason
 for
 people


to
 leave
 the
 Adobe
 ecosystem.
 I
 know


some
 people
 can
 leave
 and
 will
 leave
 to


Canva
 to
 other
 uh
 free
 stuff,
 but


they're
 making
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 on


enterprises,
 huge
 enterprises
 buying
 um


Adobe
 subscription
 professionals
 will
 be


using
 Adobe
 because
 that's
 what


everybody
 uses
 in
 the
 industry.
 When


when
 you
 look
 at
 design
 people
 that
 that


study
 in
 college,
 in
 university,


whatever,
 they
 use
 Adobe.
 They're


they're
 not
 going
 to
 use
 a
 a
 free


knockoff
 version
 of
 whatever
 you
 can


find
 on
 the
 internet.
 Everybody's
 using


Adobe.
 Yes,
 Dainci
 Resolve,
 I
 use
 it.


It's
 also
 great.
 Um,
 yes,
 Canva
 is
 free.


It's
 also
 great.
 Adobe
 Express
 is


basically
 the
 equivalent
 of
 Canva
 right


now.
 Um,
 which
 has
 become
 much
 better.


And
 again,
 this
 is
 something
 that
 an


Adobe
 employee
 told
 me.
 He
 said,
 and


this
 is
 someone
 that
 worked
 on
 Adobe


Express,
 when
 Adobe
 Express
 came
 out,
 we


didn't
 even
 like
 that
 product.
 We
 said


we
 cannot
 even
 compete
 with
 Canva,
 but


today
 we
 can.
 So
 they
 they
 were
 quite


honest
 with
 how
 crappy
 uh
 Adobe
 Express


was
 at
 first.
 So
 we
 also
 know
 that
 they


I
 mean
 they
 basically
 reiterated


guidance
 for
 for
 this
 year
 a
 month
 ago.


So
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 miss
 today.
 It's


probably
 going
 to
 be
 a
 double
 beat.
 Uh


and
 they're
 probably
 going
 to
 buy
 back
 a


lot
 of
 shares.
 But
 the
 questions
 on
 the


call
 will
 be
 okay,
 what
 about
 AI?
 Um
 I


think
 starting
 next
 year
 reporting
 wise


there
 are
 some
 changes
 that
 will
 come


again
 to
 please
 Wall
 Street
 with
 this


whole
 AI
 story.
 But
 so
 far
 again
 it's


one
 of
 those
 companies
 where
 the
 stock


is
 completely
 crushed
 and
 you
 might
 say


oh
 stock
 is
 down
 a
 lot
 so
 business
 is


doing
 bad
 but
 then
 you
 open
 the


financials
 and
 it's
 up
 and
 to
 the
 right.


Of
 course
 we've
 seen
 things
 change
 just


like
 this
 but
 so
 far
 so
 good
 I
 would


say.


I'll
 get
 my
 thoughts
 on
 Adobe
 on
 a


second.
 This
 is
 uh
 the
 update
 from
 Trump


and
 what
 he
 said
 about
 Powell
 today.


>> Now,
 at
 the
 Roosevelt
 room
 over
 at
 the


White
 House,
 the
 president
 is
 meeting


with
 CEOs
 from
 the
 the
 Technology
 CEO


council,
 including
 Michael
 Dell
 and


other
 high-tech
 executives.
 He
 just
 gave


his
 first
 reaction
 to
 the
 Fed
 rate
 cut.


In
 that
 meeting,
 uh
 he
 said
 uh
 it
 was


too
 small.
 He
 said
 this
 rate
 cut
 could


have
 at least
 been
 doubled.
 He
 was
 not


impressed.
 He
 called
 the
 Federal
 Reserve


chair
 a
 stiff
 and
 said
 that
 the
 Fed
 is


too
 focused
 on
 inflation
 and
 therefore


they
 are
 killing
 growth
 by
 not
 lowering


rates
 even
 more.
 Uh
 so
 the
 first


reaction
 there
 from
 the
 president
 in


real
 time.
 I
 also
 want
 to
 flag
 for
 you


Scott
 a
 comment
 that
 the
 president
 made.


He
 confirmed
 that
 the
 US
 government
 has


seized
 an
 oil
 tanker
 on
 the
 coast
 of


Venezuela.
 He
 called
 it
 a
 large
 tanker,


very
 large,
 largest
 one
 ever
 seized.
 Uh


so
 we
 have
 confirmation
 of
 that
 news
 now


from
 the
 president
 of
 the
 United
 States.


He
 also
 said
 other
 things
 are
 happening.


So
 you'll
 be
 seeing
 that
 later
 and


you'll
 be
 talking
 about
 that
 later
 uh


with
 some
 other
 people.
 So
 uh
 we
 don't


know
 exactly
 what
 the
 president
 was


referring
 to
 when
 he
 talked
 about
 other


things
 happening
 potentially
 in
 the


context
 of
 Venezuela
 given
 how
 he


expressed
 it.
 But
 he
 did
 confirm
 that


the
 United
 States
 has
 seized
 an
 oil


tanker.
 We
 expect
 to
 learn
 more
 about


what
 tanker
 it
 was
 on
 what
 basis
 it
 was


seized
 and
 what
 that
 means
 for
 US


Venezuelan
 relations
 as
 well.
 Scott


back.


>> All right,
 so
 some
 more
 updates
 with


Venezuela
 and
 Trump
 thinking
 that
 we


should
 have
 cut
 by
 50
 pips.
 Uh,
 do
 have


the
 market
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 red


candle
 right
 here.
 In
 terms
 of
 Adobe,
 I


am
 not
 in
 this.
 I'm
 probably
 not
 taking


this
 trade.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


take
 this
 trade.
 We
 only
 have
 eight


minutes
 to
 make
 a
 decision.
 Um,
 but
 I


think
 this
 one
 probably
 has
 a
 better


shot
 of
 going
 up
 than
 Oracle.
 And
 I'll


probably
 be
 wrong
 about
 this
 as
 well,


but
 I
 mean,
 Oracle's
 had
 a
 30%
 run.


Adobee's
 down
 21%
 for
 the
 year.
 I
 mean,


Adobe
 literally
 just
 needs
 to
 say


anything
 that
 sounds
 positive.
 We're


going
 into
 the
 last
 month
 of
 the
 year.


You've
 got
 plenty
 of
 fund
 managers
 that


really
 want
 this
 stock
 to
 do
 well.
 Uh,


it's
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 go
 up
 20%,


but
 if
 it
 can
 make
 any
 level
 of
 good


news
 around
 revenue
 growth,
 AI
 is
 a


catalyst,
 buyback
 of
 shares,
 dividend


increases,
 whatever
 they
 can
 say.
 I


mean,
 they
 don't
 have
 a
 dividend.
 Maybe


they
 announce
 a
 dividend
 that
 gets
 the


street
 potentially
 more
 excited.
 Now


granted,
 Oracle
 might
 have
 just
 like


pure
 better
 growth
 and
 that's
 what
 the


street
 might
 care
 about
 more,
 but
 I


don't
 know
 if
 I
 had
 to
 bet
 I
 think
 maybe


Adobe
 pumps
 and
 Oracle
 stays
 flat.
 Uh


hopefully
 they
 both
 end
 up
 getting
 a


pump
 today.
 S&P
 500
 right
 there
 688.
 We


are
 not
 touching
 690.
 We
 did
 touch
 it
 on


S&P.
 So
 we
 did
 touch
 690,
 6,900
 on
 the


actual
 index.
 On
 SPY
 we're
 at
 68780.


Little
 bit
 of
 a
 red
 candle
 in
 the
 last


five
 minutes.
 I
 think
 we
 all
 are
 still


pretty
 grateful
 for
 the
 move
 that
 we
 saw


today.
 Definitely
 from
 the
 dovish
 tone


from
 POW.
 Um
 but
 then
 again,
 you
 know,


markets
 are
 going
 to
 react
 violently
 up


and
 down
 and
 so
 forth
 at
 least


relatively
 strong
 on
 the
 day.
 Um
 Vatzla,


thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat
 taking
 the


oracle
 trade.
 Wish
 me
 the
 best.
 Wishing


you
 the
 best.
 Uh
 Neil,
 if
 you
 had
 to


pick
 between
 one
 or
 the
 other,
 which
 one


do
 you
 think
 pumps?
 Which
 one
 do
 you


think
 dumps?


I
 mean,
 I
 I'd
 probably
 go
 with
 I
 mean,


Pump,
 I
 guess
 even
 a
 5%
 move
 for
 Adobe


is
 is
 good
 is
 big
 enough.
 But
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 chart,
 it
 does
 exactly
 what


Salesforce
 did.
 Exactly
 the
 same.
 And


Salesforce
 reported
 last
 week
 and
 we've


seen
 it
 go
 up
 um
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 Adobe


actually
 went
 up
 with
 Salesforce.
 It's


exactly
 the
 same
 U-shaped
 type
 of
 uh
 of


move.
 I
 mean,
 I
 hope
 both
 of
 them
 go
 up


because
 Oracle,
 if
 Oracle
 is,
 let's
 say,


bad,
 then
 all
 of
 our
 AI
 investments
 are


going
 to
 go
 down
 with
 it
 tonight.
 Um,


but
 I
 think
 I
 think
 Adobe
 has
 just
 an


easier
 easier
 setup
 in
 my
 opinion
 right


now.


You
 muted.


Oops.
 I
 put
 in
 the
 chat
 there's
 four


possibilities.
 Oracle
 up,
 Adobe
 dump.


Adobe
 up,
 Oracle
 dump.
 both
 dump
 and


both
 pump.
 So,
 we'll
 see.
 I
 think
 we


covered
 pretty
 much
 every
 single


category
 there.
 Um,
 I
 don't know
 if
 I


had
 to
 bet
 maybe
 Adobe
 pumps,
 Oracle


dumps.
 If
 I
 really
 had
 to
 bet,
 I
 think


more
 likely
 it's
 Adobe
 pumps,
 Oracle's


flat.


Uh,
 could
 I
 see
 both
 pumping?
 Yes,


because
 Adobe
 is
 is
 still
 down
 for
 the


year
 and
 Oracle
 is
 still
 down
 from
 350.


I
 just
 don't
 know
 if
 that's
 the
 best
 way


to
 gauge
 it
 because
 maybe
 Oracle
 should


have
 never
 been
 at
 350.


So,
 both
 flat
 as
 a
 copout.
 You
 got
 to


have
 you
 got
 to
 have
 some
 skin
 in
 the


game.
 If
 you
 say
 both
 is
 flat,
 then
 it


doesn't
 it
 doesn't
 really
 make
 it
 that


exciting.


So,
 we're
 going
 to
 see.
 Um,


all
 right.
 We
 got
 five
 minutes
 until


this
 market
 closes
 and
 then
 we
 will
 get


some
 results
 on
 what
 we've
 got
 with


Oracle
 and
 Adobe.
 Let's
 finish
 up
 with


Gunlock
 right
 here
 and
 then
 we'll
 get


into
 these
 earnings
 in
 the
 next
 couple


minutes.


took
 a
 took
 a
 little
 jab
 at
 Trump
 by


blaming
 what
 what
 inflation
 progress
 has


failed
 to
 be
 to
 materialize
 is
 because


of
 the
 tariffs.
 I
 think
 he
 said
 it
 two


or
 three
 times.
 So
 if
 you
 jab
 Trump,


he's
 going
 to
 jab
 you
 back
 and
 call
 you


stiff
 and
 everything
 else
 because
 that's


just
 the
 way
 he's
 wired.
 So
 not


surprising
 that
 Trump
 wants
 a
 bigger


rate
 cut.
 And
 that
 just
 means
 that
 we're


going
 to
 get
 more
 rate
 cuts.
 That
 just


doubly
 reinforces
 what
 I've
 been
 talking


about.
 We're
 going
 to
 get
 rate
 cuts


after
 Powell's
 gone
 and
 it's
 going
 to


weaken
 the
 dollar.
 I
 I
 just
 think
 this


is
 crystal
 clear.
 It's
 already
 been


materializing.
 The
 dollar's
 already


down.
 Uh
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 worst
 years
 for


the
 dollar
 in
 the
 last
 25
 years.
 And
 I
 I


think
 that
 the
 rate
 cuts
 are
 going
 to


weaken
 the
 dollar
 further.
 And
 investors


should
 think
 about
 that
 seriously


because
 it's
 already
 happening
 in
 real


time.
 This
 this
 year
 has
 been
 absolutely


following
 that
 playbook.
 And
 Trump
 is


telling
 you
 through
 that
 uh
 that


outburst
 that
 rates
 are
 coming
 down
 in


the
 second
 part
 second
 half
 of
 this


year.


>> And
 whatever
 Fed
 chair
 he
 picks
 likely


is
 going
 to
 influence
 that
 decision.


Let's
 go
 back
 to
 Trump
 right
 here.
 Three


minutes
 and
 then
 we
 will
 get
 into


earnings.


>> I
 don't
 know
 why
 it
 doesn't
 make
 sense.


Usually
 I
 can
 figure
 things
 out,
 but
 I


don't
 know
 why.
 But
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 But


other
 than
 that,
 we
 should
 win
 because


we're
 doing
 great.
 The
 economy
 is


roaring.
 I
 think
 the
 economy
 is
 only


going
 to
 go,
 you
 know,
 better
 with
 all


this
 money
 pouring
 in.
 We
 have
 factories


being
 built
 and
 forget
 about
 AI.
 We
 have


AI
 more
 than
 anybody.
 We're
 leading
 AI


by
 a
 lot.
 But
 we
 have
 many
 car
 companies


coming
 in
 from
 Canada,
 from
 Mexico.


They're
 closing.
 They're
 coming
 in
 from


Mexico.
 They're
 coming
 in
 from
 Canada,


from
 Japan,
 from
 Europe,
 all
 over


Europe,
 Germany,
 all
 over
 Europe.
 Uh
 I


mean,
 we're
 doing
 great.
 But
 for


whatever
 reason,


it
 doesn't
 matter
 how
 well
 they're


doing,
 you
 know,
 good
 and
 bad,
 the
 bad,


you
 understand.
 But
 when
 even
 when
 a


pres
 president
 is
 doing
 well,
 they
 seem


to
 not
 do
 well
 in
 the
 midterms.
 So,


we're
 going
 to
 try
 and
 change
 it.
 There


should
 be
 no
 reason
 for
 it.
 If
 anybody


at
 the
 table
 can
 figure
 out,
 Bruce,
 a


nice
 psychological
 reason,
 but
 uh
 so


I
 want
 to
 win
 and
 winning
 the
 midterms


is
 important.
 People
 want
 us
 to
 win
 the


midterms
 and
 I
 think
 but
 we
 have
 we
 have


great
 spirit.
 We
 should
 win
 the


midterms.


>> All
 right,
 last
 two
 minutes.
 You're


seeing
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 red
 right
 here.


This
 is
 what
 happens
 on
 FOMC
 day.
 A
 lot


of
 the
 price
 action
 can
 be
 very


deceiving.
 It
 usually
 never
 follows


through
 until
 the
 very
 end.
 S&P
 still


though.
 Yes,
 it's
 not
 690,
 but
 687.
 We


haven't
 seen
 that
 in
 over
 a
 month.
 So,


it's
 nice
 to
 see
 that
 on
 the
 close
 in


about
 2
 minutes
 if
 we
 still
 get
 687
 up
 a


half
 a%
 on
 the
 day.
 Tesla
 down
 from
 455


to
 452.
 Amazon
 still
 holding
 on
 to
 231.


Meta
 has
 been
 flat
 all
 day.
 Google
 still


holding
 320.
 Again,
 Google
 the
 fact
 that


it's
 normalized
 the
 300s
 over
 the
 past


couple
 weeks
 is
 pretty
 incredible.
 Open


getting
 hit
 even
 with
 the
 rate
 cut.


Yeah,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 thought
 the
 open


door
 thesis
 was
 rate
 cuts
 and
 that's
 not


necessarily
 helping
 it
 at
 least
 today.


Netflix,
 wow,
 low
 of
 days.
 We
 have
 not


seen
 these
 levels
 since
 April,
 folks.


The
 April
 lows
 on
 Netflix
 were
 82.
 We're


at
 92.
 We
 have
 not
 seen
 92
 since


midappril.
 The
 absolute
 lows
 of


liberation
 day
 for
 Netflix
 were
 82.


So,
 Street's
 not
 liking
 this
 one
 for


Netflix.
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 Oscar
 is
 down


8%.
 I
 don't
 think
 Trump
 said
 anything


about
 healthare.
 I
 think
 it's
 because


the
 market
 awaits
 a
 vote
 on
 whether
 or


not
 maybe
 they
 might
 or
 might
 not
 extend


the
 enhanced
 subsidies
 because


apparently
 there's
 a
 vote
 happening


maybe
 this
 week,
 maybe
 next
 week.


>> Um,
 and
 apparently
 there
 is
 a
 plan
 that


has
 been
 proposed.
 So,
 we'll
 see.
 We'll


see
 what
 the
 market
 thinks.


>> All
 right,
 FOMC
 December
 2025.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 Wednesday,


December
 10th.
 The
 stock
 market
 is
 now


closed.


All
 right,
 we
 are
 done
 for
 the
 day.


And
 now
 we
 get
 two
 earnings
 from
 two


companies
 that
 really,
 really
 matter.


Oracle
 and
 Adobe.
 in
 the
 next
 five


minutes.
 I
 think
 Oracle
 tends
 to
 be
 very


quick.
 Adobe
 I
 think
 is
 a
 little
 bit


later
 at
 410,
 but
 we
 should
 get
 their


numbers
 very
 soon.
 Bonar
 closes
 above
 40


for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 a
 month.
 S&P
 500


at
 687.
 Netflix
 one
 of
 its
 worst
 days
 in


the
 past
 couple
 months
 down
 about
 4%.


Oscar
 down
 8%.
 ESTs
 up
 8%.
 Rocket
 Lab
 up


7%.
 Can't
 be
 too
 upset
 about
 that.
 Eli


Liy
 up
 1%.
 Google
 up
 1%.
 Meta
 flat.


Amazon
 up
 1.2.
 Tesla's
 up
 1.4.
 Uh


Palunteer
 up
 3.3.
 IWM
 all-time
 highs
 254


closed
 just
 underneath
 that
 all-time


high
 up
 1.37%.
 Grab
 went
 green
 up
 half
 a


percent.
 Nvidia
 could
 not
 make
 a
 move,


but
 that
 was
 also
 flat.
 Bitcoin


uh
 935
 to
 925.
 So,
 you
 had
 about
 a


$1,000
 candle
 to
 the
 downside.
 And
 then


Ethereum
 3450
 to
 3360
 as
 that
 one
 came


down,
 but
 still
 up
 from
 well
 much
 higher


from
 3
 weeks
 ago
 at
 or
 two
 weeks
 ago
 at


that
 2750
 level.
 Then
 Robin
 right
 there


at
 135,
 TSM
 at
 310,
 Uber
 down
 off
 some


great
 statistics
 from
 Whimo
 today.
 And


then
 Microsoft
 down
 2.78%


on
 the
 day.
 So
 we
 will
 be
 streaming


Oracle's
 earnings
 at
 5:00
 p.
 p.m.


Eastern.
 Um,
 so
 we'll
 be
 listening
 to


Oracle
 and
 we
 should
 be
 getting
 the


results


in
 the
 next
 probably
 couple
 minutes
 and


we're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 they
 say.
 Elon


has
 not
 responded
 to
 the
 SpaceX


evaluation
 and
 IPO
 launch
 in
 2026.


However,
 some
 of
 the
 reporting
 about


Elon
 pitching
 data
 centers
 in
 space
 as
 a


new
 part
 of
 SpaceX's
 business
 is
 making


me
 think
 maybe
 the
 IPO
 is
 on
 the
 table


because
 he's,
 you
 know,
 trying
 to
 create


a
 narrative
 that
 could
 I
 mean,
 you
 got


to
 sell
 a
 story
 when
 you
 go
 public,


right?
 If
 you're
 going
 to
 buy
 a
 $1.5


trillion
 company
 going
 public,
 your


upside
 has
 to
 be
 like
 three
 trillion,


right?
 And
 you
 assume
 like,
 okay,
 one


day
 it'll
 double
 maybe
 over
 the
 next


decade,
 there's
 got
 to
 be
 a
 story.
 And


maybe
 it's
 that
 data
 center


story
 for
 everybody
 else.


Oh
 yes,
 we
 have
 Synopsis
 as
 well.
 We
 do


have
 Synopsis


which
 just
 got
 an
 Nvidia
 investment
 for


two
 billion.
 Jose
 or
 not
 Jose,
 Neil,
 do


you
 know
 anything
 about
 this
 company
 or


you
 guys
 are
 two
 P's
 in
 a
 P


>> just
 just
 that
 it
 is
 in
 design
 and
 uh


you
 know
 not
 I
 haven't
 studied
 the


business
 much
 to
 be
 honest
 but
 it
 did


get
 a
 hit
 the
 last
 time
 they
 reported
 I


think
 because
 they
 said
 that
 one
 of


their
 clients
 um
 which
 was
 again
 then


leaked
 let's
 say
 that
 it
 was
 Intel
 but


then
 the
 stock
 did
 see
 a
 rebound
 because


Intel
 got
 that
 investment
 from
 the
 US


government
 plus
 then
 Nvidia
 and
 so
 now


that
 they
 have
 that
 money,
 I
 guess


synopsis
 is
 less
 scared
 that
 Intel
 is


not
 going
 to
 use
 them
 um
 that
 much


anymore.
 Um
 so
 that's
 why
 why
 you're


seeing
 that
 little
 recovery
 there
 after


the
 huge
 huge
 drop
 three
 months
 ago.
 But


other
 than
 that,
 Nada.


Yeah,
 I
 don't
 know
 too
 much
 about
 them,


but
 Jensen
 did
 give
 them
 some
 attention


as
 per
 their
 latest
 partnership.
 In


terms
 of
 what
 the
 street
 wants
 to
 see,


in
 about
 405,
 so
 in
 two
 minutes,
 we'll


get
 these
 numbers.
 So
 for
 Oracle
 Street


wants
 16.1
 billion
 in
 revenue,
 164
 of


EPS.
 Remember
 last
 quarter
 they
 didn't


even
 really
 beat
 earnings
 or
 revenue.
 I


think
 they
 might
 have
 beat
 by
 like
 a


very
 slight
 amount.
 It
 was
 that
 RPO


number
 that
 blew
 everybody
 away.
 So
 the


initial
 reaction
 might
 not
 take
 into


account
 the
 the
 underlying
 numbers


outside
 of
 EPS
 and
 revenue.
 And
 so
 we're


going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 what
 that
 turns
 out


to
 be.
 For
 Adobe
 Street
 wants
 6.1


billion
 in
 revenue
 and
 540
 of
 EPS.


And
 then
 for
 for
 Synopsis
 Street
 wants


288
 of
 VPS
 and
 then
 2.24
 billion
 of


revenue.


>> Oh,
 we're
 getting
 in
 the
 meantime.
 In


the
 meantime,
 what
 what
 are
 your


thoughts
 on
 this
 whole
 Netflix
 uh
 drama


succession
 that's
 going
 on?


>> Trump
 apparently
 said
 Warner
 Bros.
 deal


must
 include
 the
 sale
 of
 CNN.


>> That's
 hilarious,


>> dude.
 for
 everyone
 thinking
 that
 Netflix


was
 just
 going
 to
 have
 an
 easy
 time.
 I


mean,
 Steve
 was
 on
 the
 show
 on
 Friday


and
 he
 really
 made
 a
 big
 deal
 of
 this


idea
 around
 CNN
 and
 Trump.
 I
 mean,
 who's


going
 to
 buy
 CNN?
 Netflix
 is
 not
 buying


CNN.
 Their
 offer
 was
 to
 spin
 it
 out
 into


something
 else,
 right?
 Here's
 the
 here's


the
 clip
 right
 here.
 And
 then
 we'll
 get


the
 earnings
 from
 Trump
 saying
 that.


>> Get
 the
 people
 that
 have
 run
 CNN
 into


the
 ground.
 By
 the
 way,
 nobody
 watches.


Very
 few
 people
 watch.
 I
 don't
 think


they
 should
 be
 entrusted
 with
 running


CNN
 any
 longer.
 So
 I
 think
 any
 deal


should
 it
 should
 be
 guaranteed
 and


certain
 that
 CNN
 is
 part
 of
 it
 or
 sold


separately.
 But
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 people


that
 are
 running
 that
 company
 right
 now


and
 running
 CNN,
 which
 is
 a
 very


dishonest


uh
 group
 of
 people,
 I
 don't
 think
 that


should
 be
 allowed
 to
 continue.
 I
 think


CNN
 should
 be
 sold
 along
 with
 everything


else.


All
 right,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 that


story
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.
 Oracle,
 do
 we


have
 some
 numbers?
 Synopsis
 is
 up
 2%.


Oracle
 up
 2.4.


Now
 it's
 up
 one.
 Now
 it's
 barely
 up.
 Oh,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 pretty
 volatile.


It's
 going
 green
 and
 red
 super
 quick.


Um,


it
 got
 up
 to
 23.
 Oh,
 now
 it's
 down.
 Now


she's
 down.
 Now
 she's
 dumping.
 Down
 2.7.


Adobee's
 up
 2.5.
 Oracle's
 down
 2.6.


Wow.
 231
 to
 216.
 That
 could
 easily
 get


right
 back
 up
 there.
 But
 this
 is
 a


little
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 prolonged
 red


candle.


If
 that
 doesn't
 reverse,
 that
 was
 a


major
 out.
 By
 the
 way,
 go
 on
 the


earnings
 correspondent
 guy
 OnX.


>> Okay,
 I'll
 get
 it.
 Oracle
 now
 down
 4%.


Wow.
 Gave
 bulls
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 hope.


Maybe
 that
 changes
 and
 it
 reverses,
 but


right
 now
 she's
 getting
 hit.
 Oracle


numbers,
 we
 have


a
 miss.
 Slight
 miss.
 Miss
 missed
 by
 1%


on
 revenue.
 16.05
 versus
 16.19.
 EPS


though,
 40%
 beat.


Why
 is
 the
 street
 upset?
 Down
 6%.
 They


beat
 226
 EPS
 versus
 164.


What
 is
 the
 street
 mad
 about?
 That's
 a


massive
 beat
 for
 a
 company
 of
 their


size.
 Adobe
 beat
 by
 2%
 and
 then
 beat
 by


1%.
 So
 Adobe
 uh
 relatively
 small
 beats


on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 550
 versus


540,
 6.19
 versus
 6.11.
 EPS
 up
 14%


year-over-year.
 Revenue
 up
 10%


year-over-year.
 DOB's
 up
 2%.


Uh
 Oracle
 taking
 down
 the
 S&P
 with
 it.


Wow,
 6%
 on
 a
 $630
 billion
 company.


Nvidia
 is
 probably
 going
 down
 as
 well.


Nvidia,
 yep,
 Nvidia
 is
 down
 half
 a


percent
 on
 this.
 Oracle
 down
 six.
 Uh,


and
 then
 Adobe
 is
 up
 three.


Adobe
 is
 up
 three.
 Adobee's
 pumping.


Oracle's
 dumping.


That
 is
 what
 we've
 got
 right
 here.
 Uh,


let's
 get
 into
 the
 Oracle
 numbers.
 Let's


see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 some
 coverage
 on
 this


and
 then
 we'll
 go
 deeper.
 That's
 a
 big


move
 down.
 I
 mean,
 I
 thought
 it
 would
 be


weak.
 I
 didn't
 think
 it
 would
 be
 6%
 down


week.
 That
 would
 be
 two
 3%
 market
 would


then
 move
 on.
 But
 she's
 getting
 hit.


Adobe
 though
 loving
 it.
 That's
 up
 almost


4%.
 Oracle
 now
 almost
 7%.


This
 thing
 was
 at
 185
 last
 week.
 So
 I


mean
 it's
 not
 like
 it
 we
 haven't
 seen


this
 before
 but


it's
 an
 ugly
 reaction.
 Oracle
 revenue
 up


14%.
 Cloud
 was
 at
 8
 billion.
 RPO
 is
 at


523
 billion.
 I
 think
 that's
 similar
 to


last
 quarter


on
 their
 remaining
 performance


obligations.
 It
 might
 be
 a
 little
 bit


higher,
 but
 if
 it's
 higher,
 then
 it's


not
 higher
 enough
 to
 get
 this
 to
 move.


Nebius
 and
 I
 also
 getting
 hit.
 IN
 is


down
 2%.


Nebius
 down
 two.
 Okay,
 so
 Oracle
 again


cloud
 computing
 data
 centers,
 she's


taken
 down
 the
 other
 data
 center
 names


with
 her.
 Bit
 mine
 also
 down
 1.6


might
 be
 affecting
 the
 the
 broader


market.
 Adobe
 holding
 on
 to
 a
 2.5%
 move,


but
 Oracle
 right
 here
 down


6.5%.


I'm
 trying
 to
 pull
 up
 their
 actual


press
 release.


>> What
 did
 you
 say
 the
 RPO
 number
 was?


>> December.


No,
 this
 is
 from
 last
 month.


This
 is
 from
 the
 last
 quarter.
 All


right.
 So,
 we're
 still
 waiting
 for
 that


one
 to
 be
 updated,
 but
 Oracle's
 down.


Synopsis
 is
 up.
 Let
 me
 get
 Synopsis's


numbers.
 They
 had
 a


uh
 beat
 by
 1%
 290
 versus
 288
 on
 EPS
 and


then
 revenue
 2.25
 versus
 2.24
 they
 beat


by
 1%.


Beat
 by
 1%
 on
 the
 top
 and
 bottom


synopsis
 up
 slightly


right
 now.
 Yeah,
 net
 income
 6.6
 billion


versus
 4.76.
 Dude,
 they
 did
 almost
 two


billion
 more
 than
 expected
 in
 net


income.


Down
 7%
 on
 that
 is
 a
 little
 aggressive
 I


feel.
 RPO
 is
 up
 100
 billion.
 That
 is


correct.
 RPO
 went
 from
 423
 to
 523.


So
 RPO
 is
 up,
 which
 is
 good.
 The
 bigger


question
 is
 why
 is
 RPO
 up?
 And
 uh


>> I
 sent
 you
 the
 link
 in
 the
 chat.


>> Oh,
 you
 got
 it.
 Okay.
 Thank
 you,
 Neil.


Uh
 Neil,
 any
 raw
 uh
 reaction
 to
 this
 and


then
 we'll
 go
 through
 some
 of
 these


numbers
 as
 well.


I
 mean
 I
 mean
 I'm
 seeing
 RPO
 $523


billion
 but
 last
 time
 was
 a
 bit
 less.


Well,
 not
 a
 bit
 less.
 Last
 time
 was
 455.


So
 a
 bit
 less
 than
 100
 billion
 extra
 but


they
 told
 us
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 just


above
 half
 a
 trillion
 dollars.
 So
 okay,


that
 that's
 that's
 up
 438%.


Congratulations.
 Um
 which
 is
 crazy.
 But


remember
 I
 I
 said
 they
 they
 talked
 a
 lot


about
 revenue
 and
 I
 wanted
 to
 hear
 more


about
 earnings
 and
 we
 have
 a
 small
 miss


in
 revenue
 but
 a
 huge
 beat
 in
 earnings


and
 the
 stock
 is
 still
 down.
 So
 quite


quite
 confused
 with
 the
 with
 the
 with


the
 move
 but
 then
 again
 they'll
 have
 a


lot
 of
 explaining
 to
 do
 during
 the
 uh


during
 the
 earnings
 call
 with
 regards
 to


I
 mean
 this
 growing
 RPO
 number
 and
 the


huge
 part
 of
 it
 coming
 from
 a
 company


that
 does
 not
 have
 the
 revenue
 to


support
 all
 of
 these
 uh
 future
 plans.
 So


we'll
 see
 we
 can
 see
 a
 reversal
 of


course
 after
 hours.
 Um
 but
 it
 is
 a


company
 that
 is
 growing
 still
 quite


rapidly.
 I
 mean
 cloud
 revenue
 is
 up


nicely.
 Infrastructure
 is
 up
 68%.
 Of


course
 the
 the
 dollar
 amount
 is
 still


quite
 small
 compared
 to
 the
 RPO
 number


that
 you're
 seeing
 there.
 I
 mean
 we're


talking
 here
 about
 8
 billion
 in
 cloud


revenue,
 4
 billion
 in
 cloud


infrastructure.
 Uh
 but


we
 are
 going
 into
 quarters
 and
 years


where
 they
 should
 be
 generating
 a
 hell


of
 a
 lot
 more
 every
 single
 quarter.


Oracle
 down
 5.6.
 Adobe
 goes
 red.
 She
 was


up
 four.
 Now
 she's
 basically
 flat.
 She


was
 just
 down
 almost
 2%
 for
 a
 second.


Let's
 get
 some
 more
 coverage
 on
 Oracle


and
 then
 we'll
 get
 into
 uh
 Adobe
 as
 well


>> figure
 versus
 the
 $164
 adjusted


estimate.
 But
 revenue
 coming
 in
 slightly


below
 expectations
 at
 $16.1
 billion


likely
 due
 to
 a
 weakness
 in
 software


revenue
 which
 again
 just
 came
 in


slightly
 light.
 If
 we
 look
 at
 AI
 in


cloud
 the
 remaining
 performance


obligations
 which
 is
 the
 key
 bookings


number
 uh
 up
 $523
 billion
 in
 the
 second


quarter
 up
 438%
 that
 is
 a
 higher
 growth


rate
 than
 the
 previous
 quarter
 and
 above


street
 estimates.
 uh
 cloud


infrastructure
 seeing
 gains
 of
 68%


year-over-year,
 stock
 down
 about
 5.6%.


We
 have
 comments
 here
 from
 uh
 CTO
 and


chairman
 Larry
 Ellison
 how
 the
 company


is
 selling
 because
 we
 no
 longer
 he
 says


think
 it
 is
 strategic
 for
 us
 to
 continue


designing,
 manufacturing
 and
 using
 our


own
 chips
 in
 our
 cloud
 data
 centers.
 He


ha
 he
 adds
 that
 we
 are
 now
 committed
 to


a
 policy
 of
 chip
 neutrality
 where
 we


work
 closely
 with
 all
 our
 CPU
 and
 GPU


suppliers.
 Of
 course,
 we
 will
 continue


to
 buy
 the
 latest
 GPUs
 from
 Nvidia,
 but


we
 need
 to
 be
 prepared
 and
 able
 to


deploy
 whatever
 chips
 our
 customers
 want


to
 buy.
 There
 are
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of


changes,
 he
 says,
 in
 AI
 technology.
 I


would
 perhaps
 look
 at
 shares
 of
 Nvidia


to
 see
 if
 they're
 responding.
 But,
 um,


some
 interesting
 comments
 here
 from


Ellison.
 I
 don't
 see
 any
 specific


comments
 on
 financing,
 which
 of
 course


is
 a
 big
 topic
 of
 discussion
 around


Oracle,
 the
 funding
 of
 its
 massive
 data


center
 uh
 buildout,
 but
 I
 imagine
 that


will
 be
 a
 big
 topic
 when
 the
 earnings


call
 starts
 at
 5:00
 p.
 p.m.
 Eastern.


Analysts
 asking
 for
 more
 transparency
 on


whether
 this
 company
 will
 continue
 to


lean
 into
 the
 debt
 market
 or
 use
 other


tools,
 Morgan
 and
 John,
 like
 vendor


financing,
 equity,
 or
 bringing
 in
 a


sovereign
 wealth
 investor.
 Again,
 shares


of
 Oracle
 now
 down
 6%
 in
 overtime.
 Okay,


Simma
 Modi
 and
 we
 know
 you.


>> All right,
 so
 I
 guess
 the
 concerns


around
 the
 debt
 market
 are
 still
 the


issue.
 Um,
 CEO
 or
 CFO
 of
 Oracle
 said


remaining
 performance
 obligation


increased
 by
 68
 billion,
 up
 15%
 to
 523


billion.
 Um,
 Oracle
 is
 very
 good
 at


building
 and
 running
 high
 performance


and
 costefficient
 data
 centers,
 said
 the


CEO.
 For
 years,
 Oracle
 has
 been


investing
 in
 AI
 and
 building
 autonomous


cloud
 software.
 Oracle's
 autonomous


database
 and
 autonomous
 Linux
 have
 been


key
 to
 reducing
 human
 labor.


Yeah,
 they're
 just
 talking
 their
 book


right
 here
 about
 why
 AI
 is
 important
 for


their
 business,
 but
 realistically,
 the


street
 cares
 about
 uh
 the
 financing


going
 into
 how
 they're
 getting
 this


growth.
 Also,
 I
 mean,
 68
 billion
 in
 RPO.


That's
 a
 pretty
 massive
 number.
 15%
 not


year-over-year,
 but
 Q
 over
 Q.
 Uh


highlighted
 by
 new
 commitments
 from


Meta,
 Nvidia,
 and
 others.
 That
 others
 is


definitely
 something
 the
 street's
 going


to
 care
 about.
 Who
 are
 those
 others?


Because
 yeah,
 Meta
 and
 Nvidia
 can


definitely
 spend
 some
 money
 and
 it's
 not


really
 street
 doesn't
 love
 when
 Nvidia


is
 the
 one
 that's
 spending
 the
 money
 on


their
 customer.
 So,
 who
 exactly
 is


fueling
 RPO?
 Adobe.
 All right,
 Adobe


goes
 flat.
 Let's
 get
 into
 Adobe
 numbers.


Um,
 Neil,
 any
 raw
 reaction
 to
 these


numbers?
 I'll
 pull
 up
 on
 their
 website,


but
 anything
 you're
 seeing
 on
 Adobe?


>> Uh,
 on
 Adobe?
 No,
 I'm
 still
 reading
 the


the
 Oracle
 stuff
 and
 comparing
 to
 what


we
 what
 we
 had
 3
 months
 ago
 because
 3


months
 ago
 they
 they
 talked
 a
 lot
 more


about
 the
 uh
 revenue
 for
 Oracle
 Cloud


Infrastructure
 uh
 18
 $18
 billion
 for
 the


fiscal
 year
 then
 increase
 it
 to
 $32


billion,
 $73
 billion
 and
 $114
 billion
 uh


over
 the
 subsequent
 four
 years.
 And


right
 now
 we're
 not
 really
 getting
 any


update
 on
 those
 numbers.
 So
 I
 guess


that's
 also
 one
 of
 the
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 they
 might
 touch
 on
 during
 the


earnings
 call
 that
 is
 not
 present
 in


this
 press
 release
 um
 at
 the
 moment
 and


yeah
 we'll
 I
 guess
 again
 the
 question
 is


going
 to
 be
 on
 on
 this
 whole
 financing


financing
 thing
 right
 now
 for
 uh
 for


Oracle
 because


it's
 still
 yes
 it's
 cool
 your
 RPO
 is


growing
 like
 crazy
 but
 uh
 four
 years


from
 now
 is
 uh
 Yeah,


>> who
 care?
 I
 mean,
 the
 streets
 really


wondering
 who
 cares
 and
 how
 can
 you


justify
 the
 debt
 you're
 spending
 to
 get


that
 RPO
 growth.
 All right,
 Adobe


>> in
 overtime.
 The
 company
 reporting


earnings
 of
 $5.50
 a
 share,
 beat
 of
 11


cents
 a
 share.
 Revenues
 of
 more
 than
 $6


billion
 also
 topping
 estimates.
 First


quarter
 guidance
 topping
 the
 estimate
 as


well.
 Company
 says
 remaining
 performance


obligations,
 a
 measure
 of
 backlog,


stands
 at
 more
 than
 $22
 billion.
 is
 the


CEO
 Shantun
 Orion
 crediting
 strong


adoption
 of
 AI
 tools.


>> Well,
 shares
 of
 Oracle
 moving
 lower
 in


overtime.


>> Okay.
 Uh
 real
 quick
 before
 we
 do
 Adobe,


I
 forgot
 uh
 and
 and
 Oracle
 starting
 to


reverse
 a
 little bit.
 It
 was
 down
 seven,


now
 it's
 down
 six.
 Uh
 folks,
 we
 have


is
 this
 correct?
 We
 have
 Hood.
 We
 have


uh
 monthly
 metrics
 for
 Hood
 for


November.


Are
 we
 getting
 those
 today?
 I
 believe


we're
 getting
 those
 today.
 I
 don't
 have


it
 yet
 on
 my
 screen.
 We
 should
 be


getting
 in
 a
 second,
 but
 that
 is
 also


going
 to
 be
 pretty
 big
 today.
 I
 don't


have
 it
 on
 the
 website
 yet.
 Should
 be


getting
 it
 a
 second.
 But
 yes,
 December


10th,
 today's
 the
 day
 we
 should
 be


getting
 it
 in
 a
 second.
 Here
 is
 the


Adobe
 press
 release.
 CEO
 says,
 "Our


record
 fiscal
 year
 2025
 results
 reflect


our
 growing
 importance
 in
 the
 global
 AI


ecosystem
 by
 advancing
 our
 innovative


and
 generative
 agentic
 platforms.
 We
 are


excited
 to
 target
 double
 digit
 ARR


growth.
 The
 company's
 been
 growing


around
 8%,
 so
 it
 looks
 like
 they're


targeting
 10%.
 uh
 6.1
 billion
 cash
 flow


3.6
 billion
 RPO
 22
 billion
 they
 bought


back
 7.2
 million
 shares


digital
 media
 segment
 4.26
 26
 billion


total
 total
 customer
 group
 subscription


revenue
 5.96


billion
 on
 the
 day
 Adobe
 achieved


revenue
 of
 23
 billion
 for
 the
 year
 11%


year-over-year
 growth
 10
 billion
 in
 cash


flow
 and
 they
 bought
 30
 million
 shares


the
 fact
 that
 the
 stock's
 down
 25%
 for


the
 year
 they
 bought
 30
 million
 shares


is
 quite
 incredible
 uh
 revenue
 they're


targeting
 25
 to
 26
 billion
 this
 year


they
 did


just
 under
 that
 about
 10%
 under
 that
 So


again,
 they're
 targeting
 about
 23.7


billion,
 7.35
 billion
 business


professionals
 and
 earnings
 per
 share.


They're
 targeting
 around
 $1810.
 I
 think


that's
 a
 little
 bit
 higher
 than


expected.
 Not
 massive.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 also
 why
 the
 street


is
 not
 that
 excited


about
 these
 Adobe
 numbers
 right
 now.


Although
 you
 did
 have
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 pump


initially.
 Oracle
 still
 down
 four.
 It


was
 down
 seven,
 hit
 206,
 now
 down
 to


213.
 synopsis.
 I
 guess
 that's
 the
 story


of
 the
 day.
 520


up
 10%.


520
 up
 10%.
 They
 beat
 barely
 on
 the
 top


and
 the
 bottom
 streets
 like
 in
 something


that
 they
 said
 again
 they
 just
 had
 a
 big


partnership
 with
 Nvidia.
 Nvidia
 just


invested
 $2
 billion.
 Gap
 net
 income
 was


448
 million.
 That's
 up
 a
 lot


year-over-year.
 Uh
 Synopsis
 team


delivered
 a
 solid
 finish
 of
 the
 year


that
 refined
 our
 company
 and
 the
 leader


in
 engineering
 systems
 from
 silicon
 to


everything
 else.
 We
 enter
 fiscal
 year


226
 with
 an
 intense
 focus
 on
 delivering


sustainable
 growth
 and
 margin
 expansion


through
 continued
 innovation.
 We


finished
 the
 year
 with
 a
 record
 revenue


and
 a
 strong
 backlog
 of
 11
 billion
 which


underscores
 the
 resilience
 of
 our


business.
 We
 are
 expected
 to
 drive


another
 year
 of
 efficiency
 in
 2026.


>> All
 right.
 So
 I
 guess
 uh
 synopsis
 being


the
 winner
 was
 not
 on
 the
 poll
 choices,


but


that's
 the
 one
 that
 ended
 up
 winning


right
 here.
 Synopsis
 up
 10%.
 Planet


Labs.
 Jose,
 do
 you
 know
 much
 about
 this


company
 or
 or
 No,


>> I
 don't
 know.
 You
 want
 to
 put


Dude,
 I
 just
 see
 you
 as
 Jose
 because


when
 I
 watch
 your
 streams
 in
 the


background,
 I
 just
 think
 Neil,
 what
 do


you
 think
 about
 Planet
 Labs
 if
 you
 have


any
 thoughts
 on
 this
 one?


>> Uh,
 no
 thoughts
 on
 it.
 I've
 seen
 it
 pop


up
 a
 couple
 of
 times
 in
 chat
 and
 in
 my


comment
 section,
 but
 uh,
 no
 com.
 I'm


purely
 Rocket
 Lab
 and
 and
 that's
 good


enough
 for
 me.


Okay,
 so
 guys,
 let
 me
 know
 what
 this


company
 does.
 They're
 a
 space
 company.


They
 beat
 by
 100%
 on
 EPS.
 That's


relatively
 strong.
 Not
 profitable,
 but


they're
 not
 losing
 money.
 81
 million


beat
 by
 13%
 of
 revenue.
 Revenue
 is
 up


30%.
 Year-over-year
 EPS
 is
 up
 100%.


Um,


and
 so
 that's
 why
 Planet
 Labs
 is
 up.


Dude,
 I
 thought
 they
 sold
 weed,
 but


that's
 Planet
 13,
 right?


>> I
 was
 about
 to
 say,
 how
 much
 weed
 did


they
 sell?
 But
 yeah,
 that's


That's
 not
 it.
 Uh,
 satellite
 imaging.


Okay.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 it's
 a
 great
 time
 to


be
 a
 space
 company,
 especially
 over
 the


past
 couple
 of
 days.
 Okay.
 Hood.
 Let's


see
 real
 quick
 what
 we've
 got.
 All


right.
 Here
 we
 go.
 November


net
 deposits
 were
 7
 billion.
 That's
 up


25%.
 Total
 platform
 assets
 325.
 That's


down
 from
 333.
 Funded
 customers
 26.9


million.
 That's
 down.
 They
 probably
 got


rid
 of
 Yeah.
 280,000
 debt
 accounts.


uh
 through
 a
 sheetment
 which
 I
 learned


about
 for
 the
 first
 time
 a
 couple
 months


ago
 but
 that's
 when
 a
 company
 is


required
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 the
 debt


accounts.
 Um
 options
 were
 193
 million


that's
 up
 24%
 year-over-year
 but
 down


from
 October.
 Crypto
 was
 28.6
 billion


down
 12%
 down
 19%
 year-over-year.
 Okay


so
 crypto's
 down
 not
 the
 best
 events


contracts
 we
 already
 knew
 3
 billion


margin
 16.8
 8
 billion.
 That's
 up
 2%


quarter
 over
 quarter
 or
 month
 over
 month


up
 140%
 year-over-year.
 Cash
 32.5


billion.
 That's
 down
 5%
 but
 up
 23%


yearover-year.
 And
 then
 security
 lending


revenue


only
 34
 million.
 That's
 down
 40%
 month


overmonth
 even
 though
 it's
 up
 48%


year-over-year.


Yeah,
 I
 would
 call
 that
 mixed.
 I
 would


call
 that
 mixed
 for
 Hoodie.


Um,
 decent
 metrics,
 but
 not
 like


October.
 October
 was
 lights
 out.
 Now


granted,
 November
 was
 a
 really
 ugly


month
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 uh
 given
 the


market
 took
 a
 5%
 hit.
 So
 it
 makes
 sense


that
 you're
 seeing
 but
 you
 can
 see
 right


there
 October
 267
 to
 193.
 Not
 bearish
 by


any
 sense
 of
 the
 imagination.
 Just
 not


living
 up
 to
 October,
 which
 you
 know


maybe
 means
 the
 street's
 going
 to
 react


potentially
 negative
 towards
 that.
 But


still
 a
 pretty
 strong


month
 for
 for
 Hoodie.


Uh
 it's
 because
 people
 are
 moving
 to


Weeble.
 Look,
 there
 you
 could
 point
 to
 a


lot
 of
 reasons
 why
 Hood
 didn't
 have
 the


best
 November.
 The
 most
 obvious
 one
 is


when
 the
 market
 goes
 down,
 every


brokerage
 takes
 a
 hit.
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 that
 reason.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


because
 people
 are
 leaving
 everything
 to


Weeble.
 Um
 Adobe
 Jose
 thoughts
 on
 this.


Is
 it
 does
 this
 deserve
 to
 be
 flat
 or
 do


you
 think
 this
 deserves
 four
 or
 five


percent?


>> This
 is
 the
 the
 third
 the
 third
 strike


for
 tonight.


>> My
 name
 is
 Neil.
 Nice
 to
 meet
 you,


>> dude.
 What
 is
 going
 on?
 I
 don't
 know


what
 is
 happening.
 I
 just


Neil,
 what
 do
 you
 think
 about
 it?
 Now


I'm
 gonna
 have
 to
 say
 it
 because
 now
 I


got
 to
 lean
 into
 it
 because
 it's
 funny.


But
 uh
 yeah,
 should
 Adobe
 be
 up
 or
 no?


>> I
 mean,
 it's
 not
 like
 my
 name
 is
 not


written
 right
 here
 in
 in
 blue.
 But
 um


>> Oh
 my
 gosh.


>> Now
 look,
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 looking
 at
 at
 the


numbers.
 The
 numbers
 look
 fine.
 They


even
 talked
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 about
 AI


influenced
 um
 ARR
 revenue
 as
 as
 they
 did


actually
 uh
 last
 quarter
 and
 it's
 now


they
 say
 here
 total
 new
 AI
 influenced


ARR
 now
 exceeds
 onethird
 of
 uh
 the


overall
 business
 as
 we
 deeply
 integrate


AI
 deeply
 into
 our
 solutions
 and
 um
 as


they've
 shared
 before
 their
 strategy
 is


to
 drive
 the
 entire
 book
 of
 business


with
 AI
 influenced
 solutions
 again
 it's


just
 just
 to
 please
 Wall
 Street
 if
 I'm


being
 honest.
 Just
 the
 same
 the
 same


type
 of
 money
 just
 being
 u
 marketed
 as


AI
 influenced
 type
 of
 uh
 type
 of
 money.


But
 look,
 it's
 record
 cash
 flow
 from


operations,
 record
 RPO
 for
 this
 quarter.


So
 it's
 it's
 up
 and
 to
 the
 right
 for


this
 company.
 It's
 already
 very
 cheap.


Um
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 how
 much
 is
 the


stock
 down
 right
 now
 on
 these
 numbers
 on


a
 double
 beat.
 Um
 probably
 not
 that


much,
 but


>> no.


So
 yeah,
 I
 don't
 know
 the
 again
 it's


it's
 all
 about
 the
 call
 u
 more
 comments


on
 the
 whole
 business
 on
 AI
 on
 some


partnerships
 as
 well
 but
 I
 mean
 the


business
 is
 doing
 well
 they're
 extremely


profitable
 so
 it's
 the
 same
 here
 as
 as
 a


as
 a
 PayPal
 they
 just
 buy
 back
 an
 insane


amount
 of
 shares
 and
 if
 it
 continues


like
 this
 again
 in
 10
 years
 maybe
 Adobe


is
 also
 a
 a
 privately
 held
 company
 at


this
 at
 this
 rate.


Yeah.
 Um


I
 don't
 I
 I
 the
 problem
 with
 Adobe
 here


is
 like
 this
 was
 a
 good
 quarter
 as
 you


said
 records
 across
 the
 board.
 It's
 just


again
 we
 talk
 a
 lot
 about
 these


narratives
 with
 these
 stocks.
 What
 is


the
 narrative
 that's
 super
 super super


exciting
 around
 Adobe
 and
 maybe
 the


street
 is
 looking
 for
 that.
 This
 thing


got
 to
 362
 guys
 before
 it
 reversed.


Oracle
 got
 to
 203.


Uh
 Oracle
 back
 down
 to
 208
 or
 sorry
 it


got
 to
 206
 almost
 right
 back
 down
 to
 the


lows
 down
 6.5
 Street
 is
 just
 not
 buying


it


at
 these
 levels.
 And
 also
 it's
 kind
 of


hard
 to
 buy
 the
 dip
 right
 here
 because


again
 you
 don't
 know
 what
 they're
 going


to
 say
 on
 the
 call
 and
 if
 they
 end
 up


saying
 something
 a
 bit
 more
 bearish
 on


the
 debt
 financing


at
 these
 levels.


You
 know
 ironically
 I
 was
 just
 texting


Jose
 before
 before
 Neil
 came
 on
 and
 we


were
 talking
 about
 something.
 So
 now
 you


have
 to
 call
 me
 Tanner.
 That's
 how
 we


>> You
 You
 did
 indeed
 text
 me
 before.


>> No,
 no,
 I
 was
 texting
 you
 too,
 but
 Jose


separately
 I
 was
 texting
 as
 well.


>> Yeah.


>> Jose
 almost
 made
 it
 to
 stream,
 but
 he


had
 some
 stuff
 to
 do
 with
 his
 kids.
 So


>> um


Okay.
 So
 then
 Adobe
 is
 a
 nothing
 burger.


Flat
 on
 the
 day.
 Planet
 Labs
 and


Synopsis.
 These
 two
 take
 the
 show
 and


then
 Oracle
 takes
 a
 dump.


That
 is
 what
 we
 got


>> for
 now.
 For
 now,
 an
 hour
 from
 now,
 both


can
 be
 green
 or
 both
 can
 be
 down
 even


more.
 We
 I
 guess
 I
 guess
 we
 don't
 know


what
 they'll
 say
 during
 the
 earnings


call.
 But
 I
 agree
 with
 you
 with
 Oracle


right
 now.
 I
 don't
 see
 why
 anyone
 would


touch
 it
 until
 until
 the
 call
 is
 over.


Um
 because
 it's
 it's
 too
 too
 risky
 to


because
 you
 don't
 you
 don't
 know
 what


the
 the
 street
 doesn't
 like.
 I
 mean,
 we


just
 went
 over
 the
 numbers.
 Not
 like


they're
 horrible.
 And
 it's
 not
 like
 this


stock
 is
 at
 $300
 anymore.
 Um,
 but


yeah,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 know.
 Plus


the
 the
 comment
 on
 Weeble
 and
 and
 Robin


Hood.
 I
 mean,
 Weeble
 reported
 I
 think


two
 weeks
 or
 so
 ago.
 I
 I
 don't
 They
 are


growing,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 many
 Robin


Hood
 people
 went
 to
 uh
 Weeble.
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 Tesla
 holders
 actually
 went
 to


Robin
 Hood
 more
 recently.
 Um,
 Weeble


does
 apparently.
 I
 mean,
 you
 you
 you


just
 use
 Weeble.
 The
 thing
 is
 that


people
 use
 it
 for
 free
 and
 they
 don't


really
 monetize
 their
 users
 that
 well.


That's
 that's
 the
 main
 critic
 I
 think


people
 have
 with
 uh
 I
 mean
 investors


have
 with
 Weeble.
 People
 like
 the


platform
 for
 for
 what
 it
 is,
 but
 they


they
 can't
 seem
 to
 grow
 their
 paid
 users


as
 fast
 as
 the
 free
 ones
 it
 seems
 right


now.


>> Yeah.
 And
 again,
 liking
 their
 charts
 is


just
 not
 a
 bullcase.
 Like
 yes,
 a
 company


can
 have
 a
 good
 charting
 feature,
 which


is
 fine,
 but
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily
 mean


that
 the
 company
 is
 growing
 at
 a
 rate


that
 is
 exciting
 or
 meaningful.
 So,
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 see
 this
 at
 $10


and
 they
 think
 it's
 a
 baby
 Robin
 Hood,


which
 I
 get
 it.
 You
 know,
 there's
 plenty


of
 companies
 I've
 thought,
 hey,
 well,


this
 one's
 in
 the
 same
 niche.
 It's
 way


cheaper
 technically
 on
 the
 share
 price


itself
 and
 on
 the
 market
 cap.
 Maybe


it'll
 replicate
 it.
 But
 it's
 hard


because,
 you
 know,
 you've
 got
 to
 really,


especially
 in
 in
 a
 cyclical
 environment


like
 the
 stock
 market
 where,
 you
 know,


you
 really
 got
 to
 fight
 for
 your
 revenue


every
 single
 day
 because
 nothing's


guaranteed.
 Um,
 just
 given
 the
 market


conditions
 that
 that
 requires
 innovation


and
 that's
 where
 I
 don't
 think
 Weeble


necessarily
 has
 a
 big
 advantage.
 Uh,
 net


deposit
 7.1
 billion
 again,
 202
 billion


for
 equities,
 28.6
 billion
 for
 crypto.


All
 of
 these
 are
 down
 month
 over
 month


except
 margin.
 margin
 actually
 went
 up,


which
 is
 surprising
 because
 I'm
 sure


people
 got
 margin
 called
 heavily
 in


November.
 So,
 the
 fact
 that
 this
 one


actually
 got
 up
 uh
 month
 over
 month
 is


surprising,
 but
 it's
 up
 147%


year-over-year,


which
 is
 also
 what
 we're
 seeing.
 Uh


here's
 the
 coverage
 on
 Trump
 and
 this


CNN
 thing
 that
 he
 he
 just
 mentioned
 as


well.


President's
 just
 been
 talking
 about
 the


Fed
 as
 you
 guys
 have
 been
 discussing
 the


Fed.
 confirmed
 that
 he
 has
 a
 meeting


with
 Kevin
 Walsh.
 Uh
 that's
 been
 sort
 of


widely
 speculated
 about
 or
 reported.
 But


the
 president
 also
 said,
 "I
 sort
 of
 have


a
 very
 good
 idea
 of
 what
 I'm
 looking
 for


in
 terms
 of
 a
 Fed
 chair
 candidate."
 He


says,
 "I'm
 looking
 for
 somebody
 that


will
 be
 honest
 with
 interest
 rates."
 He


says,
 "Honestly,
 our
 rate
 should
 be
 much


lower."
 He
 says
 he's
 not
 going
 to
 be


asking
 uh
 the
 the
 candidates
 to
 commit


to
 lowering
 interest
 rates.
 He
 says
 he's


going
 to
 ask
 them
 questions
 and
 he'll


know
 what
 he's
 uh
 seeing
 in
 terms
 of
 the


answer
 there.
 So,
 it's
 clear
 that
 the


president
 is
 putting
 a
 low
 interest
 rate


threshold
 here
 on
 his
 selection
 of
 Fed


chair.
 He
 is
 meeting
 with
 Wsh
 although


Hassid
 has
 been
 reported
 to
 be
 in
 the


lead
 for
 that
 job.
 Uh
 the
 president


saying
 I
 sort
 of
 have
 a
 very
 good
 idea


of
 what
 I'm
 looking
 for.
 One
 other
 note


here
 from
 this
 meeting
 guys
 on
 uh
 the


Warner
 Brothers
 sale.
 The
 president
 was


asked
 about
 CNN
 uh
 and
 what
 he
 thinks
 of


the
 prospect
 of
 CNN
 being
 either


included
 in
 that
 transaction
 or
 not


included
 in
 that
 transaction.
 The


president
 said
 he
 thinks
 that
 no
 matter


what
 happens
 to
 Warner
 Brothers
 that
 CNN


should
 be
 sold
 uh
 either
 to
 the
 new


buyer
 uh
 that
 is
 Paramount
 or
 Netflix
 uh


or
 should
 be
 sold
 uh
 to
 have
 new


ownership
 in
 charge
 of
 CNN.
 That's


because
 the
 president
 says
 he
 doesn't


like
 what
 he
 sees
 as
 CNN's
 political


bias.
 He
 doesn't
 like
 the
 content
 that


he
 sees
 on
 CNN.
 He
 wants
 them
 to
 change


it.
 He
 wants
 new
 ownership
 there.
 Uh
 so


Neil,


as
 a
 foreigner,


you
 don't
 live
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Any


perspective
 on
 our
 president,
 I
 mean,


you
 don't
 have
 to
 get
 political
 here,


but
 any
 perspective
 on
 our
 president


arguing
 that
 a
 media
 network
 that
 uh


objectively
 is
 is
 not
 a
 big
 fan
 of
 him


should
 be
 sold
 in
 a
 deal
 and
 that
 might


be
 the
 lynch
 pin
 of
 making
 this
 deal


happen.
 How
 how
 do
 you
 as
 a
 European


kind
 of
 think
 of
 that?


>> I
 mean,
 me
 personally,
 uh
 the
 news
 other


than
 of
 course
 finance
 news,
 I
 I
 don't


really
 care
 that
 much
 cuz
 every
 every


news
 channel
 will
 have
 its
 angle,
 its


agenda.
 It's
 like
 this.
 But
 on
 the
 one


hand,
 nobody
 watches
 CNN,
 okay?
 Because


probably
 people
 don't
 like
 what
 what


they're
 hearing
 anymore.
 So
 I
 I
 don't


see
 why
 why
 do
 we
 need
 to
 save
 it.
 If


you
 if
 if
 you
 suck,
 then
 you
 will
 have


to
 go
 down
 and
 somebody
 else
 will


replace
 you.
 It's
 it's
 to
 me
 it's
 that


easy.
 I
 don't
 see
 why
 they
 need
 saving


whether
 it's
 Netflix
 or
 or
 or
 anyone


else.
 If
 nobody
 watches
 a
 certain


channel,
 show
 whatever.
 I
 mean
 a
 show


for
 example,
 the
 show
 gets
 cancelled
 and


we
 move
 on
 something
 else
 will
 pop
 up.


And
 the
 same
 should
 happen
 here
 whether


it's
 CNN
 or
 whether
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 Fox


or
 or
 CNBC
 or
 or
 whatever.
 If
 it
 doesn't


work
 out,
 it's
 it's
 because
 people
 don't


want
 to
 watch.
 And
 so
 create
 something


else,
 I
 guess.
 Create
 something
 else.


Much
 better.
 People
 anyways
 go
 on
 social


media,
 YouTube,
 listen
 to
 podcasts
 way


more
 than
 they
 they
 used
 to
 go
 and
 sit


at
 7
 p.m.
 or
 at
 8:00
 p.m.
 every
 night


and
 listen
 to
 their
 favorite
 uh


uh
 Ron
 Burgundy
 talk
 about
 the
 news
 and


and
 and
 whatever.
 So,


I
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,
 this
 whole


Netflix
 acquisition
 story
 thing
 really


reminds
 you
 of
 Succession.
 It's
 it's


insane
 how
 how
 accurate
 and
 close
 this


this
 is.
 But
 yeah,
 I
 mean


>> what
 what
 is
 your
 what
 is
 your
 take?
 Who


who
 gets
 uh
 who
 gets
 Warner
 Brothers,


Netflix
 or
 Paramount?


>> I
 mean
 for
 now
 they
 have
 a
 contract
 then


they
 have
 an
 agreement
 with
 with


Netflix.
 Whether
 or
 not
 that
 agreement


will
 uh
 will
 be
 broken
 up
 is
 is
 another


story.
 Now
 if
 it
 get
 broken
 up
 because


of
 Netflix
 then
 it
 will
 cost
 them
 5.8


billion
 or
 so.
 But
 if
 it
 get
 broken
 up


by
 Warner
 Brothers
 then
 they'll
 have
 to


pay
 $2.6
 six
 or
 so
 billion
 dollars
 to


Netflix
 and
 I
 guess
 Paramount
 will
 be


the
 one
 making
 making
 the
 acquisition
 if


of
 course
 it
 gets
 uh
 approved
 by


regulators
 but
 people
 say
 look
 oh


Paramount
 offers
 uh
 central
 Neil
 news


it's
 people
 say
 oh
 Paramount
 is
 offering


$30
 which
 is
 more
 than
 what
 Netflix
 is


offering
 at
 $27.50
 50
 cents
 or
 so,
 but


Netflix
 is
 offering
 that
 only
 for
 the


studios
 and
 only
 for
 streaming.
 And
 so,


yes,
 I've
 heard
 the
 the
 the
 CEO
 of
 uh
 I


mean
 uh
 what's
 his
 name?
 David
 Ellison


say
 that,
 oh
 yeah,
 but
 the
 that
 other


side
 of
 is
 worth
 only
 $1
 per
 share.


Yeah.
 Okay.
 Of
 course,
 you're
 going
 to


say
 it
 could
 to
 convince
 uh
 Warner


Brother
 shareholders
 to
 take
 your
 your


deal.
 But
 to
 to
 me,
 if
 I
 were
 a


shareholder
 one,
 if
 I
 want
 to
 exit,
 of


course,
 I'll
 take
 the
 $30.
 Thank
 you


very
 much.
 It's
 more
 money
 in
 my


pockets.
 I'm
 out.
 But
 if
 I
 really
 like


the
 business,
 which
 Warner
 Brothers
 have


been
 doing
 quite
 well,
 I'd
 say.
 Um,


then
 I
 would
 go
 with
 Netflix
 cuz
 Netflix


is
 a
 much
 better
 business
 than
 Paramount


today.
 Free
 cash
 flow-wise,


revenue-wise,
 subscribers.
 You
 might
 not


like
 the
 content.
 That's
 fine.
 there
 is


enough
 content
 on
 the
 platform
 for


everyone
 to
 like
 um
 and
 and
 to
 watch.
 I


actually
 love
 the
 content
 on
 Paramount,


Taylor
 Sheridan,
 great
 shows,


Yellowstone
 and
 and
 all
 of
 that.
 But
 I
 I


do
 think
 that
 Netflix
 combined
 with


Warner
 Brothers
 Studios
 and
 uh
 HBO


makes
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 lot
 more
 sense.
 And
 I


don't
 buy
 this
 counterargument
 that
 oh


Netflix
 is
 going
 to
 destroy
 theatrical


releases.
 They
 literally
 said
 a
 couple


of
 times
 that
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 kill


theatrical
 releases.
 What
 I
 do
 think


that
 is
 that
 again
 my
 personal
 opinion


what
 is
 killing
 cinema
 is
 one
 bad
 movies


very
 bad
 movies
 super
 expensive
 cinema


tickets
 super
 expensive
 popcorn
 and


drinks
 I
 mean
 imagine
 you
 go
 out
 to


watch
 one
 movie
 for
 two
 three
 hours
 if


you
 go
 out
 with
 friends
 and
 family


you're
 probably
 already
 paying
 $50
 $60


or
 so
 just
 for
 one
 night
 or
 you
 can
 stay


at
 home
 watch
 a
 movie
 on
 Netflix
 and


that
 cost
 you
 $18
 per
 month
 for
 the


whole
 family.
 And
 so


if
 people
 don't
 go
 to
 cinemas
 anymore,


it's
 probably
 because
 it
 became
 super


expensive
 and
 the
 movies
 suck.
 Okay.
 I
 I


I
 used
 to
 go
 a
 lot
 more
 to
 the
 to
 the


movies.
 Today,
 I'm
 only
 going
 for
 a


Christopher
 Nolan
 movie
 or
 maybe
 now


Avatar
 and
 and
 yeah,
 maybe
 some
 big


Marvel
 movies
 or
 or
 whatnot.
 But
 other


than
 that,
 even
 the
 Oscars,


I
 used
 to
 be
 very
 excited
 about
 the


Oscars
 cuz
 oh,
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 uh


this
 actor
 might
 win
 it.
 This
 movie


might
 win
 it.
 Now,
 for
 the
 last
 10


years,
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 what
 type
 of


movies
 won
 the
 the
 the
 best
 movies
 out


there.
 It's
 always
 the
 weirdest
 one
 that


that,
 let's
 face
 it,
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is


political,
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 inclusion,


culture,
 whatever.
 And
 and
 maybe
 that's


why
 people
 just
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 watch


movies
 anymore
 because
 they
 they
 used
 to


go
 watch
 movies
 for
 escapism
 because


it's
 it's
 great,
 it's
 cool,
 space


exploration
 or
 the
 Wild
 West
 or
 Cowboys


or
 Mafia
 movies.
 And
 today
 it's
 it's


more
 of
 the
 more
 of
 the
 same.
 It's
 like,


oh,
 it's
 gender
 or
 it's
 or
 it's
 color


and
 it's
 this
 and
 this
 identity
 and
 like


people
 are
 like
 gh
 leave
 me
 alone.
 Yes,


on
 Netflix
 you
 also
 have
 cultural


[ __ ]
 shows.
 Fine.
 But
 you
 have
 the


choice
 not
 to
 watch
 it.
 It's
 like


nobody's
 forcing
 you
 to
 click
 on
 that


movie.
 If
 I
 don't
 like
 a
 show,
 I'm
 like


putting
 the
 thumb
 down
 and
 it
 goes
 away


on
 my
 feet
 and
 I
 only
 have
 good
 shows
 on


the
 feed.
 So,
 um
 I
 don't
 own
 Netflix,


but
 if
 I
 would,
 I
 probably
 be
 buying


today.
 Yeah.
 If
 I
 would
 like
 to
 own
 it.


>> Well,
 so
 so
 you
 would
 uh
 you
 would
 take


advantage
 of
 this
 dip
 if
 you
 like
 or


would
 you
 personally
 be
 compelled
 like


at
 85
 at
 80?
 Like
 is
 there
 a
 price
 where


you
 think
 Netflix
 is
 a
 premium
 asset


that
 deserves
 your
 capital


>> today?
 To
 today
 I
 if
 if
 I
 would
 be


looking
 to
 buy,
 I
 would
 I
 would
 probably


buy
 it
 today.
 Again,
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 keeping


my
 cash
 for
 some
 other
 things
 that
 might


or
 might
 not
 happen.
 But
 if
 I
 would
 be


buying
 or
 looking
 to
 buy,
 I
 would


definitely
 be
 buying
 it
 uh
 today.
 It's


yes
 it's
 trading
 at
 close
 to
 30
 times


forward
 PE
 but
 it
 is
 still
 expected
 to


grow
 above
 20%
 this
 fiscal
 year
 the
 next


one
 and
 the
 one
 after
 that
 above
 20%


earnings
 growth
 and
 free
 cash
 flow
 is


also
 expected
 to
 grow
 faster
 than
 that


in
 the
 upcoming
 two
 fiscal
 year
 of


course
 excluding
 any
 acquisition


advertising
 business
 for
 them
 is


expected
 to
 to
 grow
 quite
 rapidly
 next


year
 and
 the
 years
 after
 that
 it
 is
 a


very
 well-run
 business.
 That's
 that's


just
 a
 fact,
 which
 just
 became
 much


cheaper
 than
 than
 before.
 If
 they
 do
 buy


Warner
 Brothers,
 I
 do
 think
 they
 they'll


become
 a
 an
 even
 even
 bigger
 business
 in


the
 in
 the
 future.
 And
 if
 not,
 then


yeah,
 then
 a
 competitor
 is
 going
 to
 get


those
 uh
 very
 very
 lucrative
 IPs
 because


I
 mean
 Harry
 Potter,
 Game
 of
 Thrones,
 DC


and
 etc,
 etc.
 is
 is
 is
 worth
 a
 lot
 of


money.
 is
 worth
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 of


money.
 Whether
 or
 not
 it
 goes
 on
 Netflix


because
 they
 own
 it
 or
 through
 licensing


is
 a
 is
 another
 story.


Yeah,
 I
 agree
 with
 you.
 I
 mean,
 the


biggest
 concern
 I've
 had
 about
 Netflix


for
 so
 many
 years
 was
 that
 I
 thought


tension
 was
 shifting
 away
 from


traditional
 sort
 of
 linear
 television


and
 sitting
 on
 your
 couch
 to
 people
 just


listening
 to
 a
 podcast
 or
 people
 using


that
 form
 of
 escapism
 that
 they
 had
 at


the
 movies
 with
 content
 creators
 that


they
 enjoyed
 listening
 to.
 Uh,
 so
 that


is
 sort
 of
 a
 macrobear
 case
 for
 Netflix.


But
 nonetheless,


it
 is
 still
 a
 premium
 asset
 that
 if
 they


do
 acquire
 Harry
 Potter
 and
 all
 these


amazing
 brands.
 By
 the
 way,
 I
 know
 who


Ron
 Burgundy
 is.
 Okay,
 everyone's


saying,
 "I
 don't know
 who
 that
 is."
 is


in
 Star
 Wars.
 All right.
 So,
 I
 don't


know
 why
 you
 guys
 are
 acting
 like
 I


don't
 know
 who
 this
 guy
 is.
 But,
 um,
 now


some
 of the
 other
 references
 Neil
 made,


I
 have
 no
 freaking
 clue
 what
 he
 was


talking
 about,
 but
 I
 trust
 that
 Neil


knows
 what
 he's
 talking
 about.
 Um,
 the


point
 is
 like
 I
 I
 I
 I
 I
 think
 that
 they


need
 content
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 the


Netflix
 studio
 content,
 it's
 not
 good.


Like
 some
 of
 the
 stuff
 is
 good.
 Like
 you


get
 a
 hit
 like
 Squid
 Game,
 which
 they


ruined
 season
 two
 and
 season
 3.
 Like
 I


cannot
 believe
 they
 let
 that
 show


decline
 in
 quality
 as
 and
 I
 don't
 even


think
 that's
 a
 contrarian
 take.
 It
 was


just
 season
 two
 and
 season
 3
 were


horrible.
 Uh,
 and
 then
 Stranger
 Things,


but
 like
 for
 every
 Stranger
 Things
 or
 or


Squid
 Games,
 you
 get a
 lot
 of
 crappy


shows.
 And
 the
 beautiful
 thing
 about
 HBO


Max
 is
 they
 have
 such
 high
 quality
 IP


that
 ultimately
 that
 IP
 will
 outweigh
 a


lot
 of
 the
 losers
 that
 they
 they
 end
 up


having.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 also
 I
 mean
 you
 you
 heard


the
 comment
 from
 the
 the
 Paramount
 CEO


say
 um
 yeah,
 we're
 going
 to
 release
 30


theatrical
 releases
 if
 this
 acquisition


goes
 through.
 I'm
 like
 we
 don't
 need
 30


theatrical
 releases.
 We
 need
 quality


content
 which
 is
 something
 that
 Apple


has
 been
 doing
 extremely
 well.
 Apple
 is


not
 releasing
 like
 a
 hundred
 TV
 shows


and
 movies
 every
 every
 single
 year.
 No,


that
 but
 the
 ones
 that
 they
 do
 release


is
 very
 good.
 HBO,
 same
 thing.
 They


release
 quality
 content
 that
 they've


been
 releasing
 quality
 content
 for
 for


decades
 and
 decades.
 I
 don't
 need
 30


theatrical
 releases,
 30
 movies
 coming


out
 each
 and
 every
 year.
 Something
 that


Marvel
 also
 they
 did
 very
 well
 for
 for


15
 years.
 I'd
 say
 10
 10
 12
 years
 or
 so.


And
 then
 Disney
 like
 exaggerated
 with


their
 releases
 every
 single
 month


another
 TV
 show
 that
 came
 out.
 I'm
 like


guys,
 my
 god.
 And
 and
 it
 hurt
 them


because
 there
 was
 superhero
 fatigue.


There
 was
 just
 fatigue
 period
 because
 I


mean
 we
 we
 couldn't
 keep
 keep
 up
 anymore


with
 these
 types
 of
 content.
 So
 that
 is


not
 a
 good
 argument
 to
 me.
 The
 monopoly


argument
 is
 not
 a
 good
 one
 at
 all


because


>> agree


>> Netflix
 is
 not
 a
 monopoly.
 Even
 with


this
 deal,
 they're
 not
 even
 close
 to


being
 a
 a
 monopoly.
 YouTube
 is
 leading


the
 way
 by
 far
 and
 growing
 very
 very


rapidly.


Plus,
 Netflix
 doesn't
 have
 a
 studio.
 So


now
 they'll
 own
 a
 studio,
 which
 again


wouldn't
 compete
 with
 Netflix
 core


business,
 might
 actually
 enhance
 it.
 And


Netflix
 literally
 enhances
 what
 HBO


does.
 HBO
 does
 already
 quality
 content.


Like
 you
 said,
 that's
 not
 the
 problem.


The
 problem
 is
 the
 distribution,
 and


Netflix
 fixes
 that
 in
 just
 one
 click.


Um,
 which
 is
 why
 I
 am
 all
 for
 this


acquisition.
 I
 I
 just
 really
 hope
 that


yes,
 HBO
 and
 Warner
 Brothers,
 they
 do


still
 I
 mean
 they
 stay
 HBO
 and
 Warner


Brothers
 and
 that's
 about
 it.
 I
 think


Netflix
 said
 that
 as
 well.
 We're
 not


going
 to
 rebrand
 everything
 and
 say,


"Oh,
 it's
 a
 Netflix
 original."
 No,
 it's


it's
 going
 to
 stay
 Warner
 Brothers
 and


HBO
 is
 just
 a
 brand
 owned
 by
 uh
 by


Netflix,
 which
 to
 me
 is
 is
 fine.
 Um,
 and


it
 should
 also
 help
 Netflix
 content
 like


you
 said
 because
 quality
 quality


content.
 I
 do
 like
 Stranger
 Things,
 the


last
 the
 the
 current
 season
 that
 was


released.
 I
 think
 it's
 so
 far
 so
 good.


So
 far
 so
 good.


Planet
 Labs
 getting
 a
 move
 right
 here.


Up
 17%.
 So,
 this
 one
 was
 the
 real
 winner


after
 hours.
 Adobe
 up
 a
 little
 bit.


Not
 a
 big
 move,
 but
 a
 little
 bit
 67.


Oracle
 still
 getting
 hit.
 Synopsis
 up


5%.
 It
 was
 up
 a
 bit
 more.
 Oracle
 right


there.
 Still
 down
 7%
 at
 207.
 We'll
 get


the
 call
 in
 about
 20
 minutes.
 And
 then


Nvidia


going
 down
 with
 Oracle.


Going
 down
 with
 Oracle.
 Not
 7%,
 but
 it


is
 down
 1%.
 Um
 Neil,
 another
 pick
 that


you
 had
 this
 year
 that
 you,
 you
 know,


you
 held
 on
 when
 [ __ ]
 looked
 ugly,
 but


uh
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 ended
 up


holding
 on
 with
 you,
 Micron.
 This
 one


has
 massively
 outperformed
 a
 lot
 of
 the


semiconductor
 names.
 Is
 this
 something


you're
 still
 long
 on,
 or
 do
 you
 think


it's
 time
 to
 take
 some
 profits
 here?


So,
 I
 I
 still
 own
 it.
 Um
 I
 I
 I
 am
 I
 am


thinking
 because
 they're
 yet
 to
 report.


I
 think
 they
 report
 next
 next
 week,


Wednesday
 or
 Thursday,
 one
 one
 of
 the


two,
 I
 believe.
 So,
 um
 yeah,
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm


up
 I
 think
 160%
 on
 that.
 And
 that's
 not


even
 a
 year
 old
 position,
 which
 is


crazy.
 Uh
 but
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 buying


here.
 I'm
 I
 might
 yes
 maybe
 take
 some


some
 profits
 because
 again
 if
 if
 we


continue
 to
 go
 up
 okay
 my
 initial


position
 is
 just
 going
 going
 to
 grow


more
 and
 more
 but
 if
 suddenly
 we
 hit
 a
 a


certain
 roadblock
 which
 business-wise
 I


don't
 think
 we
 will
 because
 they're


firing
 all
 cylinders
 but
 maybe
 maybe


things
 are
 uh
 priced
 too
 close


perfection
 I
 would
 say
 but
 you
 you
 are


you're
 going
 to
 need
 Micron
 SKhing


Samsung
 I
 think
 SK
 Hings
 there
 was
 some


news
 that
 came
 out
 that
 they
 are
 looking


to
 be
 listed
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Um,


that
 could
 be
 very
 interesting.
 they're


the
 leader
 in
 the
 in
 this
 whole
 memory


space
 but
 uh
 no
 I
 mean
 execution
 has


been
 very
 good
 for
 Micron


and
 yeah
 maybe
 taking
 profits
 again
 is


is
 not
 a
 bad
 thing
 where
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 year
 so
 if
 you're
 looking
 for
 for


cash
 and
 if
 you
 want
 to
 buy
 something


else
 that
 have
 has
 been
 crushed
 may
 if


you
 own
 Micron
 then
 maybe
 that's
 a
 name


you
 want
 to
 you
 want
 to
 take
 profits


from
 and
 then
 keep
 the
 rest
 for
 for
 the


ride
 because
 HBM
 for
 them
 is
 is
 still


going
 to
 go
 up
 like
 crazy.
 Uh
 and
 yeah,


they're
 they're
 fully
 focused
 on
 this


growth
 in
 AI
 and
 the
 memory
 cycle
 this


time
 is
 going
 to
 go
 much
 much
 higher
 and


it's
 going
 to
 last
 much
 longer
 than
 the


previous
 memory
 cycle
 in
 in
 phones
 and


PCs
 and
 whatnot,
 which
 was
 my
 my


original
 bull
 case
 at
 the
 start.
 I


didn't
 understand
 why
 the
 market
 hated


this
 one
 when
 it
 was
 very
 clear
 to
 me


that
 the
 current
 upcycle
 is
 just
 going


to
 be
 a
 huge
 huge
 one
 for
 them.
 And


whenever
 we
 will
 hit
 the
 end,
 I
 guess


we'll
 have
 signs
 from
 the
 big
 tech


players
 and
 the
 semiconductors
 that


okay,
 demand
 is
 slowing
 down.
 But
 so


far,
 uh,
 so
 good.


>> Yeah.
 Josh
 Wolf
 from
 Lux
 Capital,
 uh,


also
 super
 bullish,
 Micron,
 and
 they've


been
 long
 for
 a
 while.
 And
 you
 know,
 his


thesis,
 same
 as
 yours.
 If
 you're
 going


to
 have
 an
 AI
 revolution,
 you're
 going


to
 have
 to
 have
 memories
 to
 or
 you're


going
 to
 have
 to
 have
 some
 level
 of


memory
 in
 order
 to
 make
 that
 revolution


make
 sense
 in
 a
 meaningful
 way.
 Um,
 got


an
 update
 right
 here
 from
 Whimo.
 I
 mean,


they
 had
 some
 amazing
 miles
 driven


today.
 Take
 a
 look
 at
 this.
 A
 baby
 was


born
 inside
 a
 Whimo


during
 a
 ride
 to
 a
 hospital
 in
 San


Francisco.
 That


That
 is
 quite
 incredible.
 Okay,
 so
 the


question
 now
 is
 does
 that
 baby
 get
 free


unlimited
 way
 more
 rides
 for
 life?
 Cuz


that's
 usually
 what
 you
 should
 be


getting
 when
 you
 are
 born
 on
 a
 plane.


Although
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 happening


that
 much
 these
 days,
 but
 that
 was
 the


rule.
 If
 you
 if
 you're
 born
 on
 a
 plane,


you
 are
 flying
 for
 free.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 Google
 would
 get
 a


lot
 of
 brownie
 points
 if
 they
 give
 the


baby
 and
 their
 parents
 free
 Whimo


forever.


>> An
 unexpected
 delivery
 inside
 of
 a


Whimo.
 A
 baby
 born
 in
 a
 driverless
 car


is
 bound
 to
 happen.
 And
 Whimo
 says
 the


pregnant
 woman
 was
 riding
 to
 UCSF
 last


night
 when
 she
 gave
 birth
 during
 the


ride.
 Remember,
 no
 driver.
 Whimo
 says


it's
 remote
 support
 team
 detected
 that


they
 felt
 something
 unusual,
 unusual


activity
 and
 called
 to
 check
 in
 on
 the


rider.
 They
 called
 right
 through
 the


car.
 Then
 they
 called
 911.
 Whimo
 says


the
 car
 kept
 driving
 to
 the
 hospital.


Mom
 and
 baby
 made
 it
 safe
 before
 the


first
 responders
 got
 there.
 This
 is
 the


second
 time
 a
 baby
 has
 been
 born
 inside


of
 ao.
 The
 first
 birth
 happened
 in


Phoenix
 earlier
 this
 year.


>> That's
 crazy,
 bro.
 This
 is
 going
 to
 be


happening
 more
 and
 more
 as
 robo
 taxis


become
 a
 thing.
 Um,
 and
 it's
 going to
 be


part
 of
 our
 lives.


>> She
 could
 have
 been
 born
 in
 the
 back


seat
 of
 an
 Uber
 driver.
 Imagine
 that.


>> That
 would
 have
 been
 an
 experience.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 the
 fact
 that
 she
 had
 the


privacy
 to
 even
 have
 that
 baby
 in
 the


Whimo
 because
 there
 was
 no
 driver,


that's
 definitely
 another
 big
 part
 of


that
 entire
 thesis
 around
 robo
 taxis.


Uh,
 we
 got
 15
 minutes
 until
 the
 Oracle


call.
 Tom
 Lee
 just
 put
 out
 a
 new


podcast.
 I
 have
 not
 listened
 to
 all
 of


it,
 but
 here's
 a
 clip
 of
 his
 argument


for
 Ethereum.
 I
 think
 Neil,
 you're
 not


the
 most
 bullish
 on
 BMR,
 but
 you're


relatively
 bullish
 on
 the
 concept
 of
 uh


the
 Treasury,
 and
 we're
 starting
 to
 get


a
 little
 bit
 of
 recovery
 as
 the
 Fed
 has


now
 officially
 cut
 rates,


>> I
 think.
 So,
 what's
 like
 your
 wildest


price
 call
 on
 Ethereum?
 Because
 you've


made
 some
 calls,
 but
 these
 are
 boring.


$7,000,000.


>> Yeah.


>> Like
 what's
 the
 actual
 like
 craziest


call
 you?


>> Well,
 it
 can
 be
 super
 long
 time.
 I
 don't


I'm
 not
 like


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 just
 give
 people
 some


framework
 to
 think
 about
 like
 really


simple.


>> Yeah.


>> They
 should
 just
 have
 two
 ways
 to
 price


Ethereum
 in
 their
 head.
 Okay.
 One
 is
 it


what
 is
 its
 price
 ratio
 to
 Bitcoin?


That
 should
 make
 sense
 because
 they're


like,
 if
 you
 think


Ethereum's
 story
 is
 getting
 better
 than


Bitcoin,
 like
 there's
 more
 excitement
 or


things
 happening,


>> then
 its
 price
 ratio
 relative
 to
 Bitcoin


should
 go
 up.


>> I
 mean,
 it's
 sort
 of
 like


>> it
 would
 be
 like
 a
 relative
 price


comparison.


>> And
 uh
 that
 price
 ratio
 in
 the
 past
 was


like
 0.08.
 That's
 the
 average
 price
 of


Ethereum
 to
 Bitcoin.


Well,
 if
 someone
 thinks
 Bitcoin's
 get


gets
 to
 200,000,
 which
 I
 think
 it
 will,


then
 Ethereum
 just
 to
 get
 to
 its


long-term
 average
 is
 like
 16,000.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.
 And
 it's
 like
 3,000
 right
 now.


Now,
 if
 Ethereum
 gets
 to
 the
 same
 value


as
 Bitcoin,
 the
 network
 value,
 that's


like
 250,000,


which
 could
 Ethereum
 be
 more
 valuable


than
 Bitcoin
 at
 in
 the
 future.
 Keep
 in


mind,
 Open
 AI
 is
 probably,
 if
 it
 was
 a


publicly
 traded
 company,
 would
 be
 worth


a
 trillion
 dollars.
 And
 it's
 one
 of
 four


or
 five
 LM.
 Open
 AI
 just
 by
 itself
 is


worth
 three
 times
 Ethereum
 right
 now.
 Is


Ethereum
 more
 valuable


in
 relative
 to
 AI?
 Right.
 Opening
 is


just
 one
 of
 like
 eight
 models.
 And
 if


Ethereum
 is
 the
 dominant
 L1,


>> shouldn't
 that
 be
 worth


>> more
 than


>> a
 couple
 trillion?


>> Neil,
 uh,
 do
 you
 agree
 with
 that
 general


sentiment
 or
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 a
 it's


reaching
 a
 little bit
 too
 much
 on


Ethereum?


>> I
 mean,
 any
 comparison
 with
 OpenAI
 for


me
 doesn't
 doesn't
 make
 much
 sense


because
 I
 don't
 believe
 that
 OpenAI


should
 be
 trading
 where
 it's
 trading


right
 now.
 in
 the
 in
 the
 private
 market.


I
 mean,
 Dan,
 I've
 spoke
 on
 CNBC,
 I
 think


this
 morning
 or
 yesterday,
 and
 said
 that


that
 their
 valuation
 is
 conservative.


I'm
 like,
 are
 you
 serious?
 Is
 it


conservative?
 It's
 not
 conservative,
 but


but
 fine.
 You
 know what?
 Fine.
 Um,
 look,


if
 I
 mean,
 if
 it
 plays
 out,
 if
 we
 are


going
 to
 get
 like
 a
 huge
 infrastructure


refresh
 where
 everything
 or
 every
 asset


runs
 on
 on
 Ethereum,
 then
 I
 guess
 yes,


BMR
 and
 and
 Tom
 Lee
 are
 going
 to
 be


proven,
 right?
 Um,
 they
 aren't
 even


staking
 right
 now,
 right?
 I
 don't
 think


they
 are
 staking
 their
 so
 that
 that's


yet
 yet
 to
 come
 and
 and
 to
 generate
 them


quite
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 cash.
 So
 I


think
 people
 should
 put
 their


expectations
 a
 bit
 a
 bit
 lower.
 The


these
 things
 will
 take
 time
 to
 play
 out.


I
 mean
 I
 remember
 the
 first
 big
 uh


presentation
 that
 he
 gave
 a
 couple
 of


months
 ago
 with
 regards
 to
 the
 the


trillion
 in
 market
 um
 financial
 markets


and
 how
 that
 will
 change
 and
 how


how
 f
 well
 not
 how
 fast
 the
 number
 that


Ethereum
 could
 grow.
 Why
 was
 it
 60,000


so
 I
 can't
 remember
 the
 exact
 number
 he


he
 put
 there
 and
 I'm
 like
 okay
 but
 to


reach
 that
 number
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 need


to
 go
 his
 way
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 things


will
 take
 years
 and
 years
 and
 years.
 um


time
 to
 to
 reach
 those
 goals


five five
 10
 years
 from
 now
 are
 we
 going


to
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 tokenization
 probably
 I


mean
 we
 already
 seeing
 it
 today
 but
 to


reach
 a
 trillion
 dollar
 market
 and


refreshing
 the
 whole
 infrastructure


there
 is
 just
 going
 to
 take
 a
 while
 and


I
 think
 expectations
 for
 a
 lot
 of


investors
 need
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 lower
 a
 lot


lower
 and
 more
 realistic
 I
 would
 say


>> yeah
 I
 agree
 I
 mean
 there
 is
 a
 massive


bullc
 case
 on
 Ethereum
 from
 a


tokenization
 stable
 coin
 perspective
 but


the
 undeniable
 truth
 is
 that
 it
 requires


a
 liquid
 environment
 in
 the
 context
 of


um
 global
 liquidity
 which
 is
 why
 the


rate
 cut
 stuff
 was
 good
 today
 but
 you


just
 don't
 get
 that
 mass
 appeal
 and
 that


risk
 on
 sentiment
 if
 you
 don't
 have


liquid
 ecosystem
 and
 so
 we've
 been


tightening
 for
 three
 years
 I
 think
 the


intersection
 of
 Wall
 Street
 and
 crypto


is
 real
 but
 you
 need
 the
 Fed
 to
 be
 on


your
 side
 and
 if
 it
 is
 in
 2026
 then
 that


could
 be
 bullish
 Uh,
 Paramount
 just
 sent


out
 a
 letter
 or
 I
 think
 Warner
 Brothers


sent
 out
 a
 letter.
 Let's
 get
 an
 update


right
 here
 on
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 this


Netflix
 situation.


>> Welcome
 back
 to
 Overtime.
 We
 got
 an


update
 on
 the
 battle
 for
 Warner
 Brothers


Discovery.
 Julia
 Bon
 has
 that
 for
 us.


Julia?


>> Well,
 we've
 seen
 a
 letter
 from
 Paramount


Sky
 Dance,
 which
 has
 just
 gone
 out
 to


Warner
 Brothers
 Discovery
 shareholders


urging
 them
 to
 accept
 the
 $30
 per
 share


tender
 offer.
 Some
 key
 notes
 here
 in


this
 letter.
 The
 letter
 says
 to
 suggest


we
 are
 not
 good
 for
 the
 money
 or
 might


commit
 fraud
 to
 try
 to
 escape
 our


obligations
 as
 certain
 reports
 have


speculated
 is
 absurd.
 They
 go
 on
 to
 say


that
 absurdity
 is
 underscored
 by
 the


fact
 that
 Warner
 Brothers
 discovering


his
 adviserss
 never
 picked
 up
 the
 phone


or
 typed
 out
 a
 responsive
 text
 or
 email


to
 raise
 any
 questions
 or
 concern
 or
 to


seek
 out
 any
 clarification.
 They
 go
 on


to
 say,
 "For
 the
 avoidance
 of
 doubt,
 our


$6
 billion
 synergy
 estimate
 does
 not


rely
 on
 cuts
 to
 content
 budgets
 at
 our


studios."
 and
 they
 intend
 to
 continue


running
 both
 separately
 post
 close.
 They


say
 those
 synergies
 will
 be
 from


technology
 linear
 networks
 optimization


and
 real
 estate
 rationalization.
 They


also
 criticize
 Netflix's
 strategy
 when


it
 comes
 to
 regulatory
 approval,
 saying


Warner
 Brothers
 transaction
 with
 Netflix


appears
 to
 be
 in
 for
 a
 long
 and
 bumpy


ride
 as
 it
 navigates
 the
 global


regulatory
 review
 process.
 They
 say
 that


um
 the
 the
 argument
 being
 advanced


publicly
 by
 Netflix
 and
 its
 proxy
 states


that
 regulators
 should
 ignore
 the


streaming
 video
 on
 demand
 market
 and


instead
 utilize
 a
 gerrymandered
 market


definition
 that
 includes
 services
 like


YouTube,
 Tik
 Tok,
 Instagram,
 and


Facebook.
 going
 on
 to
 say
 Netflix's


claim
 boils
 down
 to
 trying
 to
 mask
 its


dominance
 in
 streaming
 video
 on
 demand


by
 grouping
 together
 all
 internet


enabled
 video
 media
 and
 social
 media
 or


otherwise
 saying
 no
 regulator
 has
 ever


accepted
 such
 a
 broad
 approach
 to
 market


definition
 and
 to
 do
 so
 would
 require


regulators
 to
 give
 up
 on
 merger


enforcement
 in
 media
 and
 social
 media


alike.
 Quite
 harsh
 words
 here
 in
 this


letter
 that
 Paramount
 Sky
 Dance
 is


sending
 to
 Warner
 Brothers
 Discovery


shareholders
 urging
 them
 to
 tender
 their


shares.
 Uh
 and
 we
 will
 reach
 out
 to
 the


parties
 for
 comment
 especially
 the


criticism
 of
 the
 regulatory
 potential.


Back
 over
 to
 you.


>> Yeah,
 super
 fascinating
 especially
 when


you
 see
 shares
 of
 Paramount.


>> Does
 does
 that
 scream
 desperation
 to


you?


>> I
 was
 I
 was
 just
 just
 about
 to
 say
 the


exact
 the
 exact
 same
 thing.
 they
 sound


very
 desperate
 and
 the
 the
 the
 argument


to
 I
 mean
 the
 counterargument
 to
 the


argument
 that
 Netflix
 is
 is
 making
 here


with
 regards
 to
 yes
 the
 competition
 is


of
 course
 YouTube
 it's
 Instagram
 it's


Tik
 Tok
 it's
 some
 it's
 not
 something
 new


it's
 something
 if
 you
 go
 back
 to
 their
 I


think
 press
 release
 of
 I
 don't
 know
 two


three
 years
 or
 so
 ago
 they
 already
 said


it
 they
 they
 said
 their
 competitors
 are


the
 likes
 of
 of
 Tik
 Tok
 Fortnite
 I


believe
 they
 even
 they
 they
 specifically


mentioned
 Fortnite
 in
 one
 of
 their
 one


of
 their
 letters
 because
 yes,
 you
 are


competing
 with
 these
 types
 of
 companies


because
 these
 types
 of
 companies
 are


also
 entertaining
 and
 the
 most
 important


part
 here
 consume
 people's
 time
 in
 their


day.
 You
 are
 you
 have
 you
 are
 you
 have


24
 hours
 a
 day
 people
 sleep
 work
 and


then
 or
 maybe
 don't
 work
 I
 don't
 know


but
 in
 the
 mean
 in
 between
 those
 things


you
 might
 or
 might
 not
 watch
 Netflix


Instagram
 res
 Tik
 Tok
 play
 Fortnite
 Call


of
 Duty
 um
 and
 eventually
 GTA
 in
 2046


whenever
 that
 things
 comes
 out
 um
 so


yeah
 it
 this
 is
 the
 desperate
 attempt


for
 from
 them
 their
 bit
 is
 not
 really


not
 that
 attractive
 if
 you're
 asking
 me


plus
 if
 you
 still
 want
 to
 own
 share
 your


your
 own
 share
 of
 a
 company
 that
 that


has
 quite
 a
 lot
 of
 debt
 anyways.
 But


yeah,
 the
 the
 market
 share
 argument
 is


I'm
 going
 with
 what
 Netflix
 is
 is
 saying


because
 I
 also
 think
 that
 I
 mean
 Roku
 is


saying
 it.
 I
 think
 YouTube
 is
 saying
 it.


So
 what
 only
 Paramount
 is
 not
 seeing


that
 the
 competition
 is
 is
 Tik
 Tok,


YouTube
 and
 and
 all
 the
 others
 doesn't


make
 doesn't
 make
 much
 sense.


I
 know
 they
 don't
 have
 the
 money.
 So


that's
 why
 they
 have
 to
 raise
 tens
 of


billions
 of
 dollars.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 I
 I
 think
 uh
 Warner
 Brothers


would
 rather
 sell
 to
 a
 company
 that
 they


know
 that
 has
 the
 money
 and
 is
 good
 for


it.
 Now
 Larry
 Ellson's
 got
 a
 ton
 of


money
 and
 he
 can
 backs
 stop
 it,
 but


there's
 a
 different
 sense
 of
 selling
 to


an
 indiv.
 I
 mean
 essentially
 you're


selling
 it
 to
 Larry.
 You're
 not
 selling


it
 to
 Paramount.
 You're
 selling
 it
 to


Ellison
 because
 he's
 the
 one
 back


stopping
 the
 trade.
 Versus
 Netflix
 has
 a


lot
 of
 equity
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 assets
 that


you
 know
 they're
 good
 for
 it.
 So,
 it


makes
 sense
 why
 they
 went
 with
 Netflix


over
 Paramount,
 but
 you
 know,
 the
 Trump


stuff
 is
 definitely
 going
 to
 complicate


how
 this
 actually
 uh
 actually
 ends
 up


getting
 done.
 These
 were
 the
 top
 20


options
 or
 the
 top
 20
 stocks
 trading
 in


the
 options
 market
 today.
 Tesla
 and


Nvidia
 again
 at
 number
 one
 and
 two.


Netflix
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 a
 long


time
 getting
 there
 at
 number
 three
 with


823,000
 contracts
 that
 were
 traded


today.
 Okay,
 then
 you
 got
 TSM,
 Palanter


in
 the
 top
 five,
 Oracle,
 Amazon,
 Warner


Brothers,
 Microsoft,
 IBIT,
 Apple,
 Micro


Strategy,
 SoFi,
 Meta,
 Intel,
 Uber,


GameStop,
 Open
 Door,
 Rivian,
 and
 AMD.


So,
 these
 were
 your
 names


that
 were
 traded
 the
 most


uh
 throughout
 the
 entire
 day.
 And


obviously,
 the
 earnings
 for
 Oracle
 is


probably
 going
 to
 increase
 some
 of
 that


volatility.
 Uh,
 we
 got
 four
 minutes


until
 the
 Oracle
 call.
 Neil,
 if
 you
 had


to
 ask
 a
 question
 on
 this
 call,
 same


thing
 to
 the
 chat
 and
 I'll
 put
 a
 poll
 if


you
 think
 Oracle
 reverses
 right
 here.


What
 would
 be
 the
 question
 that
 you


asked
 today?


>> I
 think
 it's
 uh
 I
 think
 it's
 the


question
 is
 uh
 okay,
 you
 you've
 given
 us


the
 RPO
 three
 months
 ago.
 you've
 given


us
 sort
 of
 a
 road
 map
 on
 revenue


recognition,


but


seeing
 how
 a
 big
 chunk
 of
 your
 IPO
 is


coming
 from
 a
 certain
 company
 that
 does


not
 have
 the
 financial
 capability
 to


support
 such
 projects.


What
 is
 how
 are
 you
 going
 to
 basically


achieve
 achieve
 all
 of
 this?


No,
 Jose,
 you
 are
 muted.


>> Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for


letting
 me
 know.
 European
 Jose,
 I
 I'll


be
 Indian
 Jose.
 You're
 European
 Jose.


And
 then
 the
 actual
 Jose
 is
 just
 Jose.


We
 got
 to
 troll
 him
 on
 this
 next
 time
 he


comes
 on
 because
 he's
 probably
 not


watching.
 He
 doesn't
 know
 that
 we
 did


this.
 Um,


what
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say,
 the
 the
 if
 I


was
 a
 CEO,
 I
 I
 would
 say
 I
 you
 you
 got


to
 glaze
 Open
 AI,
 right?
 You
 got
 to
 be


like
 OpenAI
 is
 the
 best
 company
 in
 the


world
 and
 they're
 growing
 the
 fastest


and
 they
 need
 a
 lot
 of
 compute
 and
 cloud


and
 I
 mean
 you've
 got
 to
 make
 the
 market


believe
 that
 Oracle
 is
 going
 to
 be
 one


of the
 core
 providers
 for
 OpenAI.
 So


it's
 it's
 not
 like
 it's
 a
 hard
 answer,


but
 it's
 a
 question
 of
 does
 the
 market


believe
 it?
 And
 Sam
 Alman
 didn't


necessarily
 give
 them
 the
 most
 to


believe
 in
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks


with
 the
 code
 red
 and
 the
 way
 he


answered
 some
 of
 these
 questions.
 So
 I


think
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 uh
 the


biggest
 thing.
 This
 is
 what
 the
 two
 CEOs


said
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago
 when
 they
 were


asked
 about
 the
 partnership
 last
 time.


>> You
 don't
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a


winner
 take
 all
 kind
 of
 a
 situation?


>> I
 I
 think
 the
 market
 is
 too
 big.


>> No.
 Look,
 the
 the
 the
 market's
 too
 big


and
 I
 think
 that
 there's
 far
 too
 much


kind
 of
 open
 space
 that
 has
 to
 be


solved.
 Do
 do
 I
 think
 that
 there
 might


be
 winner
 or
 take
 all
 in
 certain
 niches?


Of
 course.
 But
 the
 reality
 is
 is
 that
 AI


is
 applicable
 to
 everything.
 you
 know,


someone
 who's
 really
 good
 at
 optimizing


uh
 for
 uh
 you
 know,
 uh
 drug
 discovery,


it
 may
 not
 be
 the
 same
 model
 provider


that's
 really
 good
 at
 optimizing
 your


business
 results.
 So,
 I
 think
 there's


going
 to
 be
 many
 winners.
 And
 the
 good


thing
 uh
 for
 us
 in
 terms
 of
 mitigating


any
 downside
 is
 that
 the
 infrastructure


these
 customers
 needs
 while
 in
 some
 ways


it's
 customized
 is
 largely
 the
 same.
 And


so
 really
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 buildout


that's
 happening
 across
 the
 industry,


it's
 a
 bet
 on
 the
 success
 of
 AI.


Obviously,
 we
 have
 a
 great
 relationship


with
 OpenAI,
 but
 there
 are
 many


different
 customers
 that
 are
 all
 going


to
 need
 this
 type
 of
 infrastructure
 for


many,
 many
 years
 to
 come.


>> You
 don't
 think
 it's
 going to
 be?


>> I
 don't
 know if
 Larry
 Ellison's
 going
 to


be
 on
 the
 call
 today.
 I
 think
 he
 was
 on


the
 call
 last
 time


and
 so
 maybe
 we'll
 see
 him
 comment


today,
 but
 if
 not,
 these
 are
 going
 to
 be


the
 two
 CEOs
 that
 are
 going
 to
 be


talking
 and
 um
 yeah,
 we're
 going
 to
 see


what
 they
 end
 up
 saying.
 Broadcom,
 by


the
 way,
 for
 those
 asking,
 is
 tomorrow


along
 with
 Lulu,
 which
 is
 tomorrow.


So,


today
 is
 just
 going
 to
 be
 Oracle.


Okay,
 call
 is
 not
 live
 yet.
 Should
 be


live
 in
 a
 second.


About
 30
 more
 seconds


and
 then
 we'll
 see
 what
 we
 get
 for


Oracle.
 Uh
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 poll
 54
 about


50/50
 54%
 say
 no
 we
 don't
 get
 a
 reversal


oracle
 right
 here


still
 bleeding
 7%.


I
 mean
 it
 touch
 flat
 green
 flat.


>> Yeah
 compared
 to
 Oracle
 Dolby
 is
 having


a
 great
 day.


Um
 but
 yeah
 I
 mean
 maybe
 Oracle
 dips


back
 below
 200
 if
 it
 gets
 that
 ugly.
 And


also
 the
 call
 for
 the
 first
 30
 minutes


might
 be
 really
 boring.
 I
 actually
 this


is
 my
 first
 time
 legit.
 Like
 I've


listened
 to
 parts
 of
 the
 call
 before.


This
 is
 my
 first
 time
 listening
 to
 the


whole
 thing.
 Um
 so


this
 call
 might
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 numbers


that
 are
 read
 before
 we
 get
 into
 any


question
 that
 actually
 affects


the
 market.
 And
 so
 we're
 going
 to
 have


to
 see
 what
 the
 street
 actually
 cares


about
 when
 the
 call
 goes
 live.
 Uh
 Nvidia


as
 well


getting
 hit.
 This
 one
 just
 again
 I
 think


it
 uh
 do
 you
 do
 you
 think
 that
 Nvidia
 do


AMD
 do
 you
 think
 AMD
 is
 a
 better
 buy


right
 now
 versus
 Nvidia
 or
 do
 you
 think


the
 OpenAI
 concern
 is
 still
 an
 issue
 for


Nvidia
 because
 I
 know
 you're
 way
 long


AMD
 Neil
 how
 are
 you
 thinking
 of
 those


two


>> I
 mean
 it's
 not
 like
 OpenAI
 I
 mean
 AMD


OpenAI
 has
 also
 they
 also
 have
 that
 that


relationship
 now
 right
 because
 if
 OpenAI


delivers
 then
 they
 get
 10%
 of
 AMD
 in
 uh


what
 is
 it
 five
 five
 years
 or
 or


something
 like
 that
 if
 AMD
 reaches
 uh
 a


trillion
 dollar
 in
 valuation
 based
 on
 on


the
 uh
 trenches
 that
 they
 they
 need
 to


meet
 from
 OpenAI.
 So
 it's
 not
 just
 I'm


I'm
 surprised
 that
 that
 AMD
 is
 not


getting
 hit
 as
 much
 as
 Nvidia
 more


recently
 but
 uh
 I'm
 I'm
 fine
 with
 that.


But
 again
 Nvidia
 reported
 three
 weeks
 or


so
 ago
 I
 mean
 we
 were
 live
 and


numbers
 were
 good.
 Things
 seem
 to
 be


going
 their
 way
 and
 and
 it's
 not
 slowing


down
 anytime
 soon.
 So,
 it's
 it's
 just


purely
 sentiment
 right
 now
 and
 and
 it


will
 change.
 We
 we've
 had
 that
 before.


We've
 had
 the
 Blackwell
 heating
 issues


slash
 delays.
 Then
 we've
 had
 deepsek.


Then
 we
 have
 well
 we
 have
 China
 every


every
 every
 month
 we
 have
 China
 issues


or
 even
 though
 they've
 told
 us
 that


China
 is
 zero
 zero
 dollars
 right
 now
 of


their
 business.


Yes,
 they
 might
 send
 H200s
 to
 China.


China
 might
 not
 allow
 it.
 So
 maybe


they're
 sending
 it
 somewhere
 else
 and


Chinese
 companies
 are
 I
 don't
 know
 what


the
 heck's
 going
 on
 there.
 But
 anyways,


it's
 zero
 dollars
 of
 their
 business.
 um


what
 was
 zero
 dollars
 before
 and
 is
 now


becoming
 much
 much
 bigger
 for
 them


larger
 is
 UAE
 is
 Saudi
 Arabia
 is
 all
 of


these
 other
 countries
 that
 are
 buying


huge
 amounts
 of
 uh
 of
 Nvidia
 GPUs
 and
 I


don't
 think
 that's
 slowing
 down
 anytime


soon.
 So
 I
 might
 not
 own
 Nvidia
 but
 I'm


very
 bullish
 on
 on
 Nvidia.
 I'm
 of
 course


very
 bullish
 on
 AMD
 purely
 from
 upside


perspective
 I
 guess.
 Um
 but
 execution
 is


uh
 for
 both
 of
 them
 has
 been
 quite
 good.


Next
 year
 it's
 a
 big
 year
 for
 uh
 for
 AMD


because
 they
 are
 really
 coming
 out
 with


a
 much
 better
 competing
 competing


solution
 with
 the
 MI400
 series.
 Um
 and


funny
 enough
 AMD
 has
 a
 has
 an
 close


relationship
 with
 AM
 with
 uh
 OpenAI
 and


also
 Oracle.
 Um
 so
 we'll
 see.


All
 right,
 let's
 get
 into
 the
 call
 and


then
 we
 will
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


Three
 cents
 positive
 impact
 on
 earnings


in
 Q2.
 For
 Q3,
 assuming
 currency


exchange
 rates
 remain
 the
 same
 as
 they


are
 now,
 currency
 should
 have
 a
 two
 to


3%
 positive
 effect
 on
 revenue
 and
 have
 a


six
 cents
 positive
 effect
 on
 EPS


depending
 on
 rounding.


In
 terms
 of
 the
 results
 for
 Q2,
 we
 had


another
 excellent
 quarter
 of
 execution.


Remaining
 performance
 obligations
 or
 RPO


ended
 the
 quarter
 at
 523.3


billion
 up
 433%
 from
 last
 year
 and
 up
 68


billion
 since
 the
 end
 of
 August
 driven


by
 contracts
 signed
 with
 Meta
 Nvidia
 and


others
 as
 we
 continue
 to
 diversify
 our


customer
 backlog.


RPO
 expected
 to
 be
 recognized
 in
 the


next
 12
 months
 grew
 40%
 year-over-year


compared
 with
 25%
 last
 quarter
 and
 21%


last
 year.


Total
 cloud
 revenue
 which
 include


includes
 both
 applications
 and


infrastructure
 was
 up
 33%
 at
 8
 billion


representing
 a
 significant
 acceleration


from
 the
 24%
 growth
 rate
 reported
 last


year.
 Cloud
 revenue
 now
 accounts
 for


half
 of
 Oracle's
 overall
 revenue.


Cloud
 infrastructure
 revenue
 was
 4.1


billion,
 up
 66%
 with
 GPU
 related
 revenue


growing
 177%.


Oracle's
 cloud
 infrastructure
 businesses


continue
 to
 grow
 much
 faster
 than
 our


competitors.


Cloud
 database
 services
 revenue
 was
 up


30%.
 With
 autonomous
 database
 revenue
 up


43%
 and
 multicloud
 consumption
 up
 817%.


Cloud
 applications
 revenue
 was
 3.9


billion
 and
 up
 11%.


Our
 strategic
 back
 office
 applications


revenue
 was
 2.4
 billion
 and
 up
 16%.


As
 we
 finished
 combining
 our


industry-based
 cloud
 apps
 and
 our
 fusion


cloud
 apps
 under
 one
 selling


organization
 in
 each
 region
 across
 the


world,
 we
 have
 been
 seeing
 increasing


cross-selling
 synergies
 that
 are


expected
 to
 drive
 higher
 cloud


applications
 growth
 rates
 in
 the
 future.


All
 in
 total
 revenues
 for
 the
 quarter


were
 16.1
 billion
 up
 13%
 and
 higher
 than


the
 9%
 growth
 reported
 in
 Q2
 last
 year


continuing
 our
 trend
 of
 accelerating


total
 revenue
 growth.


Operating
 income
 grew
 8%
 to
 6.7
 billion.


Non-GAAP
 EPS
 was
 $2.26
 26
 up
 51%.


While
 GAP
 EPS
 was
 $210


up
 86%.


We
 recognized
 a
 pre-tax
 gain
 of
 2.7


billion
 in
 the
 quarter
 stemming
 from
 the


sale
 of
 our
 interest
 in
 a
 year.


Turning
 to
 cash
 flow,
 operating
 cash


flow
 in
 Q2
 was
 2.1
 billion
 while
 free


cash
 flow
 was
 a
 negative
 10
 billion
 and


capex
 was
 12
 billion,
 reflecting
 the


investments
 being
 made
 to
 support
 our


accelerating
 growth.


As
 a
 reminder,
 the
 vast
 majority
 of
 our


capex
 investments
 are
 for
 revenue


generating
 equipment
 that
 is
 going
 into


our
 data
 centers
 and
 not
 for
 land,


buildings
 or
 power
 that
 collectively
 are


covered
 via
 leases.
 Oracle
 does
 not
 pay


for
 these
 leases
 until
 the
 completed


data
 centers
 and
 accompanying
 utilities


are
 delivered
 to
 us.
 Rather,
 the


equipment
 capex
 is
 purchased
 very
 late


in
 the
 data
 center
 production
 cycle,


allowing
 us
 to
 quickly
 convert
 cash


spent
 into
 revenues
 earned
 as
 we


provision
 cloud
 services
 to
 our


contracted
 and
 committed
 customers.


In
 terms
 of
 funding
 our
 growth,
 there


are
 a
 variety
 of
 sources
 available
 to


us.


I
 think
 that's
 on
 their
 side
 for
 the


audio


>> throughout
 our
 debt
 structure
 in
 public


bond
 bank
 and
 private
 debt
 markets.
 In


addition,
 there
 are
 other
 financing


options
 through
 customers
 that
 may
 bring


their
 own
 chips
 to
 be
 installed
 in
 our


data
 centers
 and
 suppliers
 who
 may
 lease


their
 chips
 rather
 than
 sell
 them.
 Both


of
 these
 options
 enable
 Oracle
 to


synchronize
 our
 payments
 with
 our


receipts
 and
 borrow
 substantially
 less


than
 most
 people
 are
 modeling.
 As
 a


foundational
 principle,
 we
 expect
 and


are
 committed
 to
 maintaining
 our


investment
 grade
 debt
 rating.


Turning
 to
 guidance,
 let
 me
 start
 with


the
 impact
 of
 the
 added
 RPO
 that


occurred
 in
 Q2
 on
 our
 future
 results.


The
 vast
 majority
 of
 these
 bookings


relate
 to
 opportunities
 where
 we
 have


near-term
 capacity
 available,
 which


means
 we
 can
 convert
 the
 added
 backlog


to
 revenue
 sooner.
 The
 result
 is
 we
 now


expect
 4
 billion
 of
 additional
 revenue


in
 FY27.


Our
 fullear
 FY26
 revenue
 expectation
 of


67
 billion
 remains
 unchanged.
 However,


given
 the
 added
 RPO
 this
 quarter
 that


can
 be
 monetized
 quickly
 starting
 next


year,
 we
 now
 expect
 fiscal
 2026
 CAFAX


will
 be
 about
 15
 billion
 higher
 than
 we


forecasted
 after
 Q1.


Finally,
 we
 are
 confident
 that
 our


customer
 backlog
 is
 at
 a
 healthy
 level


and
 that
 we
 have
 the
 operational
 and


financial
 strength
 to
 execute


successfully.


While
 we
 continue
 to
 experience


significant
 and
 unprecedented
 demand
 for


our
 cloud
 services,
 we
 will
 pursue


further
 business
 expansion
 only
 when
 it


meets
 our
 profitability
 requirements
 and


the
 capital
 is
 available
 on
 favorable


terms.


As
 it
 relates
 to
 specific
 guidance
 for


Q3,


total
 cloud
 revenue
 is
 expected
 to
 grow


from
 37%
 to
 41%
 in
 constant
 currency
 and


is
 expected
 to
 grow
 from
 40%
 to
 44%
 in


USD.


Total
 revenues
 are
 expected
 to
 grow
 from


16%
 to
 18%
 in
 constant
 currency
 and
 are


expected
 to
 grow
 from
 19%
 to
 21%
 in
 USD.


Non-GAAP
 EPS
 is
 expected
 to
 grow
 between


12%
 to
 14%
 and
 be
 between
 A$164
 and
 A168


in
 constant
 currency
 and
 grow
 between


16%
 to
 18%
 and
 be
 between
 A$1.70
 and


A$1.74
 in
 USD.
 And
 with
 that,
 I'll
 turn


it
 over
 to
 Clay.


>> Thank
 you,
 Doug.
 Our
 infrastructure


business
 has
 grown
 at
 an
 accelerating


66%
 year-over-year.
 You
 are
 well
 aware


of
 the
 strong
 demand
 for
 AI


infrastructure,
 but
 multiple
 segments


across
 OCI
 are
 also
 contributing
 to
 this


accelerating
 growth
 rate,
 including


cloud
 natives,
 dedicated
 regions,
 and


multicloud.
 Our
 diversity
 of


capabilities
 within
 infrastructure


differentiates
 us
 from
 AI
 infrastructure


neoclouds.
 Our
 unique
 combination
 of


infrastructure
 and
 applications


differentiate
 us
 from
 other


hyperscalers.


We
 have
 ambitious
 achievable
 goals
 for


capacity
 delivery
 worldwide.
 OCI
 now


operates
 147
 live
 customer-f
 facing


regions
 with
 64
 more
 regions
 planned.
 In


the
 last
 quarter,
 we
 handed
 over
 close


to
 400
 megawatts
 of
 data
 center
 capacity


to
 our
 customers.
 We
 also
 delivered
 50%


more
 GPU
 capacity
 this
 quarter
 than
 Q1.


Our
 supercluster
 in
 Abalene,
 Texas
 is
 on


track
 with
 more
 than
 96,000
 Nvidia
 Grace


Blackwell
 GB200
 delivered.
 We
 also
 began


delivering
 AMD
 MI355
 capacity
 to


customers
 this
 quarter.
 Our
 pace
 of


capacity
 delivery
 continues
 to


accelerate.


We
 continue
 to
 see
 strong
 demand
 for
 AI


infrastructure
 across
 training
 and


inferencing.
 We
 follow
 a
 very
 rigorous


process
 before
 accepting
 customer


contracts.
 This
 process
 ensures
 that
 we


have
 all
 the
 necessary
 ingredients
 to


deliver
 to
 customer
 success
 at
 margins


that
 make
 sense
 for
 our
 business.
 We


analyze
 land
 and
 power
 for
 data
 center


buildings,
 component
 supply,
 including


GPUs,
 network
 gear
 and
 optics,
 labor


costs
 for
 all
 phases
 of
 construction
 and


low
 voltage
 work,
 engineering
 capacity


to
 design,
 build
 and
 operate,
 revenue


and
 profitability,
 and
 capital


investments
 required.
 Only
 when
 all


these
 components
 come
 together
 do
 we


accept
 customer
 contracts
 having
 the


confidence
 we
 can
 deliver
 on
 schedule


with
 the
 highest
 quality.
 As
 Doug
 said


this
 quarter
 we
 contracted
 for
 an


additional
 68
 billion
 of
 RPO.
 These


contracts
 will
 quickly
 add
 revenue
 and


margin
 to
 our
 infrastructure
 business.


We
 continue
 to
 carefully
 evaluate
 all


future
 infrastructure
 investments,


investing
 only
 when
 we
 have
 alignment


across
 all
 necessary
 components
 to


ensure
 profitable
 delivery
 for
 our


customers.


The
 holiday
 season
 is
 peak
 period
 for


many
 of
 our
 retail
 and
 consumer


customers.
 It
 is
 our
 responsibility
 at


OCI
 to
 deliver
 the
 most
 secure,
 highest


performance,
 and
 highest
 availability


infrastructure
 to
 support
 these


customers
 at
 the
 scale
 they
 need.
 Uber


has
 now
 surpassed
 three
 million
 cores
 on


OCI,
 powering
 their
 highest
 traffic
 ever


this
 Halloween.
 T-Mu
 scaled
 to
 nearly
 1


million
 cores
 for
 Black
 Friday
 and
 Cyber


Monday.
 In
 addition,
 we
 also
 supported


thousands
 of
 other
 customers
 across
 our


retail
 and
 other
 applications
 through


their
 largest
 and
 most
 successful


holiday
 period
 yet.


OCI
 is
 constantly
 expanding
 in
 features


and
 services.
 We
 recently
 launched


Acceleron
 delivering
 enhanced
 networking


to
 all
 OCI
 customers
 and
 other
 services


like
 our
 AI
 agent
 service.
 However,
 we


cannot
 deliver
 everything
 ourselves
 and


we
 rely
 on
 our
 rapidly
 expanding
 partner


community
 to
 provide
 the
 best
 experience


on
 OCI.
 We
 added
 new
 AI
 models
 from


Google,
 OpenAI,
 and
 XAI
 to
 ensure
 our


customers
 have
 the
 latest
 and
 greatest


AI
 capabilities.
 Our
 marketplace


consumption
 has
 grown
 89%


year-over-year,
 powered
 by
 partners
 like


Broadcom
 and
 Palo
 Alto.
 Those
 same


partners
 drive
 OCI
 consumption
 by


building
 their
 SAS
 businesses
 on
 OCI.


Palo
 Alto
 released
 their
 Sassy
 and


Prisma
 access
 platform
 on
 OCI
 and
 Cyber


Reason
 and
 Newfold
 Digital
 continue
 to


scale
 their
 businesses
 rapidly.
 These


partnerships
 make
 our
 ecosystem
 richer,


which
 helps
 our
 customers
 and
 that


growth
 translates
 directly
 into
 more
 OCI


growth.
 As
 our
 partners
 build
 their


solutions
 on
 our
 infrastructure,


Oracle
 database
 services
 see
 increasing


demand
 across
 all
 clouds.
 Multiloud


database
 consumption
 has
 increased
 817%


year-over-year.
 We
 launched
 11
 multi


cloud
 regions
 this
 quarter,
 bringing
 us


to
 45
 regions
 live
 across
 AWS,
 Azure,


and
 GCP
 with
 27
 more
 planned
 over
 the


next
 month.
 We
 see
 increasing
 customer


demand
 with
 billions
 in
 identified


pipelines.
 We
 launched
 two
 important


programs
 this
 quarter
 for
 multicloud.


The
 first
 is
 multiloud
 universal
 credits


which
 enables
 customers
 to
 commit
 once


to
 Oracle
 database
 services
 and
 use
 them


anywhere
 in
 any
 cloud
 with
 the
 same


price
 and
 flexibility.
 The
 second
 is
 our


multiloud
 channel
 reseller
 program
 which


enables
 customers
 to
 procure
 Oracle


database
 services
 through
 their


preferred
 ch
 uh
 channel
 partners.
 We


also
 launched
 nine
 services
 across
 the


different
 clouds
 such
 as
 Oracle


autonomous
 AI
 lakehouse.
 This


combination
 of
 the
 best
 services,


universal
 availability,
 consistent
 and


easy
 pricing
 and
 procurement
 and
 partner


support
 is
 accelerating
 the
 adoption
 of


Oracle
 database
 services
 across
 our


entire
 customer
 base.
 OCI
 is
 the
 only


full
 cloud
 available
 to
 individual


customers.
 We
 launched
 dedicated
 region


25
 which
 provides
 the
 full
 capability
 of


OCI
 in
 a
 tiny
 three
 rack
 footprint.
 OCI


is
 also
 the
 only
 cloud
 that
 enables


partners
 to
 become
 cloud
 providers


themselves
 through
 our
 alloy
 program
 and


our
 new
 footprint
 is
 available
 for
 all


alloy
 providers.
 Dedicated
 region
 and


alloy
 consumption
 grew
 69%


year-over-year.
 We
 launched
 one


dedicated
 region
 for
 Itha
 group
 in
 Oman


and
 both
 NT
 data
 and
 SoftBank
 launched


one
 alloy
 region
 each
 this
 quarter.
 This


brings
 our
 live
 dedicated
 regions
 to
 39


with
 25
 more
 planned.
 In
 summary,
 the


four
 segments
 of
 our
 infrastructure


business
 are
 growing
 at
 incredible


rates.
 This
 will
 contribute
 to
 a


continued
 acceleration
 in
 our


infrastructure
 revenue
 in
 the
 coming


quarters.
 Customers
 are
 choosing
 OCI
 for


its
 performance
 optimized
 architecture,


unrelenting
 focus
 on
 security,


consistently
 low
 and
 predictable


pricing,
 and
 unmatched
 depth
 in
 database


and
 enterprise
 integration.
 Those


priorities
 have
 been
 our
 strategy
 from


the
 beginning
 and
 are
 the
 driving
 force


behind
 this
 growth.
 OCI
 is
 in
 a
 constant


state
 of
 reinvention
 and
 you
 can
 see
 the


value
 that
 has
 for
 our
 customers.
 When


you
 combine
 our
 commitment
 to
 deliver


the
 best
 in
 performance,
 efficiency
 and


security
 with
 the
 growing
 customer


demand
 for
 cloud
 infrastructure
 services


we
 are
 seeing.
 I
 couldn't
 be
 more


excited
 about
 what's
 coming
 next.
 And


with
 that
 over
 to
 Larry.


>> Thank
 you
 very
 much
 Clay.


Over
 the
 years
 Oracle
 has
 developed


software
 in
 three
 important
 areas


database
 applications
 and
 the
 Oracle


cloud.


We
 used
 AI
 to
 make
 our
 database
 software


and
 our


autonomous
 software
 eliminates
 human


labor
 and
 human
 error,
 thus
 lowering


operating
 costs
 and
 making
 our
 systems


faster,
 more
 reliable,
 and
 more
 secure.


Now,
 with
 the
 development
 of
 the
 Oracle


AI
 database
 and
 the
 Oracle
 AI
 data


platform,
 we're
 bringing
 all
 three


layers
 of
 our
 software
 stack
 together
 to


solve
 another
 very
 important
 problem,


enabling
 the
 latest
 and
 most
 powerful
 AI


models
 to
 do
 multi-step
 reasoning


on
 all
 your
 private
 enterprise
 data


while
 keeping
 that
 data
 private
 and


secure.


Training
 AI
 models
 on
 public
 data
 is
 the


largest
 fastest
 growing
 business
 in


history.


AI
 models
 reasoning
 on
 private
 data


will
 be
 an
 even
 larger
 and
 more
 valuable


business.


Oracle
 databases
 contain
 most
 of
 the


world's
 high
 value
 private
 data.


Oracle
 applications
 also
 all
 hold
 huge


amounts
 of
 exceptionally
 valuable


private
 data.


The
 Oracle
 cloud
 includes
 all
 the
 top
 AI


models,
 OpenAI
 chat
 GPT,
 XAI
 GRO,
 Google


Gemini
 and
 Metal
 Lama.


Oracle's
 new
 database
 and
 AI
 data


platform,
 plus
 the
 latest
 versions
 of


Oracle
 applications,


enables
 all
 of
 those
 AI
 models
 to
 do


multi-step
 reasoning
 on
 your
 database


and
 application
 data
 while
 keeping
 that


data
 private
 and
 secure.


All
 our
 database
 and
 application


customers
 want
 to
 do
 this
 because
 for


the
 first
 time
 they
 get
 a
 unified
 view


of
 all
 of
 their
 data.


AI
 models
 can
 respond
 to
 a
 single


inquiry
 by
 reasoning
 across
 all
 your


databases,
 all
 of
 your
 applications,


by
 treating
 all
 of
 your
 data


holistically.
 The
 combination
 of
 AI


models
 plus
 the
 Oracle
 AI
 database
 and


AI
 data
 platform
 breaks
 down
 the
 walls


that
 isolate
 and
 fragment
 your
 data.
 The


Oracle
 AI
 data
 platform
 makes
 all
 your


data
 all
 your
 data
 accessible
 to
 AI


models.
 Not
 just
 Oracle
 databases
 and


Oracle
 applications.
 The
 data
 in
 Oracle


databases
 and
 Oracle
 applications
 but


data
 from
 other
 databases.
 Cloud
 storage


from
 any
 cloud.
 Even
 data
 from
 your
 own


custom
 applications
 are
 accessible
 to
 AI


models
 using
 the
 Oracle
 AI
 data


platform.


Using
 our
 AI
 data
 platform,
 you
 can


unify
 all
 your
 data
 and
 reason
 on
 all
 of


your
 data
 using
 the
 very
 latest
 AI


models.


This
 is
 the
 key
 to
 finally
 unlocking
 all


the
 value
 in
 all
 your
 data.
 very
 soon


through
 the
 lens
 of
 AI,
 you
 will
 be
 able


to
 see
 everything
 happening
 in
 your


business
 as
 it
 happens.
 Mike,
 over
 to


you.


>> Thanks,
 Larry.
 Uh,
 as
 Doug
 shared,
 the


total
 revenue
 growth
 up
 13%
 in
 constant


dollars.
 I
 think
 it's
 worth
 noting
 that


that's
 three
 consecutive
 quarters
 now


where
 total
 revenue
 growth
 has
 been
 in


double
 division.
 So,
 a
 solid
 quarter
 and


we
 see
 even
 better
 days
 ahead
 of
 us.
 So,


let
 me
 break
 down
 a
 few
 of
 the
 numbers
 a


bit
 further
 and
 I'll
 do
 so
 all
 in
 in


constant
 currency.
 Cloud
 applications


revenue
 was
 up
 11%
 and
 that
 brings
 us
 to


a
 about
 a
 $16
 billion
 annualized
 run


rate.
 Within
 that,
 Fusion
 ERP
 up
 17%.


Fusion
 SCM
 up
 18%.
 Fusion
 HCM
 up
 14%.


Netswuite
 grew
 by
 13%.
 Fusion
 CX
 is
 up


12%.
 In
 our
 industry
 cloud,
 specifically


hospitality,
 construction,
 retail,


banking,
 restaurants,
 local
 governments,


and
 communications
 all
 combined,
 we're


up
 21%
 in
 a
 quarter.
 So,
 so
 big
 growth


rates
 on
 on
 on
 a
 big
 base
 in
 our
 health,


>> bro.
 Their
 call
 is
 having
 issues.
 It's


not
 me.


Audio
 problem.


Oh,
 he's
 just
 regulatory
 EHR
 is


generally
 available
 and
 it
 has
 received


US
 regulatory
 approval.
 And
 finally,
 in


healthcare
 in
 Q3,
 we
 expect
 both
 our


bookings
 and
 our
 revenue
 to
 accelerate


materially.
 So
 overall,
 cloud
 apps
 were


up
 11%
 on
 a
 big
 bigger
 base.
 This
 is


very
 meaningful
 because
 we
 see
 this


business
 as
 continuing
 to
 accelerate


going
 forward.
 We
 achieved
 this
 growth


uh
 while
 we
 also
 undertook
 a
 major


Salesforce
 reorg
 in
 many
 regions


throughout
 the
 world.
 This
 is
 something


we've
 been
 talking
 about
 for
 many
 years


and
 that
 is
 the
 synergies
 between
 our


back
 office
 applications
 and
 our


industry
 applications.
 We're
 seeing
 more


and
 more
 deals
 where
 our
 industry
 apps


are
 pulling
 fusion
 or
 the
 fusion
 apps


are
 pulling
 the
 industry
 apps.
 And
 as
 a


result
 of
 seeing
 more
 and
 more
 deals,


we're
 also
 seeing
 larger
 deals
 with
 more


components.
 So
 recently,
 we
 combined
 our


industry
 application
 sales
 team
 and
 our


fusion
 sales
 teams
 into
 a
 single
 selling


organization.
 This
 enables
 our
 sellers


to
 have
 more
 strategic
 one
 oracle


conversations
 with
 our
 customers
 to
 sell


higher
 and
 to
 sell
 more.
 And
 then
 when


you
 think
 about
 our
 very
 large
 install


base
 of
 on-
 premise
 application


customers,
 these
 strategic
 conversations


are
 driving
 upgrades.
 And
 you've
 heard


us
 say
 before,
 just
 moving
 a
 customer
 to


the
 cloud
 results
 in
 a
 3
 to
 5x
 annual


revenue
 lift
 compared
 to
 support


revenue.
 Now
 on
 top
 of
 all
 that,
 top
 of


the
 Salesforce,
 the
 the
 one
 Oracle
 go
 to


market
 uh
 oneleacle
 go
 to
 market


motions,
 the
 industry
 suites,
 think


about
 combining
 our
 AI
 data
 platform


with
 this
 unmatched
 suite
 of


applications.
 This
 creates
 an
 incredibly


unique
 opportunity
 for
 our
 customers
 to


gain
 value
 very
 quickly
 from


enterprisegrade
 AI.
 The
 combination


allows
 customers
 to
 unite
 the


industryleading
 foundational
 models
 with


company
 specific
 proprietary
 data
 as


Larry
 mentioned
 much
 of
 which
 comes
 from


the
 Oracle
 applications
 and
 of
 course


the
 AIA
 data
 platform
 also
 ties
 in


non-Oracle
 applications
 competitive
 data


sources
 like
 MongoDB
 or
 Snowflake
 object


stores
 and
 even
 complete
 bespoke


unstructured
 data.
 So
 we
 think
 this


allows
 our
 customers
 to
 very
 very
 easily


build
 enterprise
 lakehouses,
 AI
 agents


and
 applications
 that
 leverage
 builtin


not
 bolted
 on
 but
 built-in
 AI
 to


transform
 their
 business.
 So
 just
 to


repeat
 AI
 of
 course
 uh
 is
 a
 great
 OCI


play
 but
 it's
 also
 a
 broader
 software


play
 for
 Oracle.
 It's
 driving
 growth
 in


our
 applications
 and
 our
 database


businesses
 as
 well.
 Let
 me
 let
 me


highlight
 a
 few
 key

signed
 a
 new
 5-year
 expansion
 to


accelerate
 AI
 adoption
 and
 to
 transform

 all
 built


on
 OCI.
 Uh
 this
 actually
 this
 5-year


deal
 was
 an
 expansion
 an
 extension
 of
 a


partnership
 that
 began
 with
 Tim
 Brazil's


full
 data

 migration
 to
 OCI
 back


in
 2021.
 So
 they're
 now
 building
 AI

 that
 are
 powering
 real

 including
 the

 even


further

 as
 the

continues.
 They've
 got

 Seven
 of
 them
 are
 already
 in


production
 in
 just
 a

 of
 months.


Six
 more
 launching
 soon,
 all
 enabled
 by


a
 multi
 cloud

 with
 Oracle


as
 a
 key
 AI
 infrastructure
 partner.


Already
 as
 a
 result
 of
 this
 this
 initial


roll
 out,
 customer
 satisfaction
 is
 up


16%
 and
 call

 I
 could
 go

 but
 I
 think
 it


gives
 you
 the
 flavor
 of
 just
 the
 sheer


amount
 of
 multi-pillar

 and
 why
 it's


so
 important
 uh
 that

 11%.


Just
 to
 reinforce
 my
 earlier
 statements


that
 we
 expect
 continued
 apps
 growth


acceleration.
 So
 a
 solid
 quarter
 across


the
 board.
 We're
 on
 the
 back
 end
 of
 a


sales
 reorg
 that
 was
 focused
 on
 unified


selling
 across
 our
 applications


portfolio.
 We're
 seeing
 a
 clear
 AI
 halo


effect
 for
 our
 cloud
 applications
 which


is
 driving
 upgrades.
 Our
 AI
 data


platform
 combined
 with
 our
 applications


is
 an
 absolute
 conversation
 changer
 and


it
 brings
 the
 Oracle
 database
 and
 all
 of


our
 applications
 into
 the
 center
 of
 a


modern
 agentic
 enterprise.
 Looking


ahead,
 we're
 executing
 well
 on
 a
 big
 and


growing
 pipeline
 and
 I
 expect
 revenue


and
 earnings
 growth
 to
 accelerate
 off
 an


even
 larger
 base.
 With
 that,
 Ken,
 I'll


turn
 it
 back
 to
 you.


Mike.
 Uh,
 Tiffany,
 if
 you
 could
 please


pull
 the
 audience

 Again,
 we
 will
 pause
 for
 just


a
 moment
 to
 compile
 the
 Q&A
 roster.


>> Your
 first
 question
 comes
 from
 the
 line


of
 Brad
 Zelnik
 with
 Deutsche
 Bank.


Please
 go
 ahead.


>> Thank
 you.
 Congratulations
 and
 a


particular
 shout
 out
 to
 Mahesh
 and
 the


team
 for
 standing
 up
 a
 massive
 amount
 of


capacity
 in
 this
 quarter.
 My
 question
 is


for
 Clay
 or
 maybe
 Doug.
 Oracle
 is


clearly
 the
 destination
 of
 choice
 for


the
 most
 sophisticated
 AI
 customers,
 but


this
 is
 a
 far
 more
 capital
 inensive


proposition
 unlike
 any
 business
 Oracle's


ever
 been
 in
 before.
 Very
 specifically,


how
 much
 money
 does
 Oracle
 need
 to
 raise


to
 fund
 its
 AI
 growth
 plans
 ahead?
 Thank


you.


Thanks
 for
 the
 question,
 Brett.
 This
 is


Clay.
 Um,
 so
 look,
 I
 I'll
 answer
 that


question
 in
 two
 parts.
 First,
 uh,
 let
 me


give
 you
 kind
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 it's


hard
 to
 answer
 that
 question
 exactly.


So,
 um,
 the
 thing
 I
 think
 that
 a
 lot
 of


people
 don't
 understand
 is
 that
 we


actually
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 options


for
 how
 we
 go
 about
 delivering
 this


capacity
 to
 customers.
 There's
 obviously


the
 way
 that
 people
 think
 about
 it,


which
 is
 we
 buy
 all
 the
 hardware
 up


front.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 as
 we,
 as
 I
 talked


about
 at
 my
 financial
 analyst
 meeting,


uh,
 we
 don't
 actually
 incur
 any
 expenses


for
 these
 large
 data
 centers
 until


they're
 actually
 operational.
 Um,
 so


then
 it
 goes
 on
 to,
 well,
 how
 do
 you
 pay


and
 and
 what's
 the
 kind
 of
 cash
 flows


look
 like
 for
 the
 stuff
 that
 goes
 into


the
 data
 center?
 Well,
 we
 have
 some


other
 interesting
 models
 that
 we've
 been


working
 on.
 One
 of
 them
 is
 that


customers
 can
 actually
 bring
 their
 own


ships.
 And
 in
 those
 models,
 Oracle


obviously
 doesn't
 have
 to
 incur
 any


capital
 expenditures
 upfront
 uh,
 for


that
 model.
 Uh
 similarly
 we
 have
 uh
 uh


different
 models
 that
 we're
 working
 on


with
 different
 vendors
 where
 some


vendors
 are
 actually
 very
 interested
 in


a
 model
 where
 they
 rent
 their
 capacity


rather
 than
 selling
 their
 capacity
 and


as
 you
 can
 imagine
 that
 comes
 with


different
 cash
 flow
 uh
 impacts
 that
 are


favorable
 and
 reduce
 the
 overall


borrowing
 needs
 uh
 and
 capital
 required


for
 Oracle.
 Um
 so
 as
 you
 can
 imagine
 as


we
 look
 at
 all
 of
 these
 kind
 of


commitments
 we
 will
 use
 a
 range
 and
 a


variety
 of
 those
 such
 that
 we
 minimize


the
 overall
 cost
 of
 capital
 uh
 as
 well


as
 you
 know
 in
 certain
 cases
 we'll
 be


raising
 our
 own
 funds.
 Um
 as
 part
 of


that
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 that


everyone
 understands
 that
 we're


committed
 to
 maintaining
 our
 investment


grade
 debt
 rating.
 Um,
 so
 now
 to
 give


you
 some
 more
 specifics,
 what
 I
 would


say
 is
 we
 we've
 been
 reading
 a
 lot
 of


analyst
 reports
 and
 we've
 read
 quite
 a


few
 that
 show
 an
 expectation
 of
 upwards


of
 a
 hundred
 billion
 dollars
 um
 for


Oracle
 to
 go
 out
 and
 kind
 of
 complete


these
 buildouts.
 And
 based
 on
 what
 we


see
 right
 now,
 we
 expect
 we
 will
 need


less,
 if
 not
 substantially
 less
 uh,
 you


know,
 money
 raised
 than
 than
 that
 amount


um
 to
 go
 and
 fund
 this
 buildout.
 So


hopefully
 that
 helps
 answer
 your


question,
 Brad.


It
 does.
 Thank
 you.
 That's
 very
 helpful


and
 thanks
 for
 taking
 the
 question.


>> Your
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 the
 line


of
 Ben
 Brightus
 with
 Melius
 Research.


Please
 go
 ahead.


>> Hey
 guys,
 thanks
 a
 lot.
 Uh,
 appreciate


it.
 Good
 to
 speak
 with
 you.
 In
 light
 of


the
 answer
 to
 that
 question,
 uh,
 the


path
 for
 OCI
 margins
 seems
 very


important
 to
 improving
 the
 EBID
 cash


flow.
 So
 at
 the
 analyst
 meeting
 you
 said


margins
 for
 AI
 workloads
 for
 OCI
 would


be
 in
 the
 30
 to
 40%
 range
 over
 the
 life


of
 a
 customer
 contract.
 I
 guess
 my


question
 is
 how
 long
 will
 it
 take
 your


AI
 margins
 across
 all
 your
 OCI
 data


centers
 to
 ramp
 to
 that
 level
 and
 what


needs
 to
 happen
 to
 get
 there?


>> Yeah,
 thank
 thanks
 for
 the
 question
 Ben.


Um
 look
 the
 answer
 is
 it
 really
 depends.


So
 the
 good
 thing
 is
 that
 um
 as
 as
 I


mentioned
 earlier
 the
 we
 don't
 actually


incur
 any
 expenses
 for
 the
 data
 centers


until
 they're
 actually
 built
 and
 up
 and


running
 and
 then
 we've
 highly
 optimized


our
 process
 by
 which
 we
 actually
 put


capacity
 in
 and
 then
 are
 able
 to
 hand


that
 over
 to
 customers
 which
 means
 that


the
 period
 of
 time
 where
 we're
 incurring


the
 expenses
 without
 uh
 that
 kind
 of


revenue
 and
 the
 gross
 margin
 profile


that
 we
 talked
 about
 um
 is
 really
 on
 the


order
 of
 a
 couple
 of
 months.
 So,
 so
 in


that
 you
 know
 scenario
 that
 time
 period


is
 not
 material.
 So
 a
 couple
 of
 months


is
 not
 is
 not
 a
 long
 time.
 The
 what


actually
 you
 know
 matters
 much
 more
 is


the
 overall
 mix
 of
 uh
 the
 data
 centers


that
 we
 have
 online
 right
 and
 how


they're
 growing
 compared
 to
 the
 total


amount
 that
 we're
 scaling
 across
 the


world.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 as
 we
 go
 through


this
 buildout
 phase
 right
 right
 now


we're
 in
 a
 phase
 of
 very
 rapid
 buildout


without
 uh
 the
 majority
 of
 the
 capacity


online.
 Obviously
 the
 aggregate
 mix
 is


going
 to
 be
 lower
 but
 as
 we
 actually
 get


the
 majority
 of
 this
 capacity
 online
 and


that's
 really
 our
 focus.
 The
 best
 way
 to


improve
 margins
 quickly
 is
 to
 actually


go
 out
 and
 deliver
 capacity
 faster.
 Um


that
 ends
 up
 very
 rapidly
 uh
 ensuring


that
 we
 get
 to
 that
 30
 to
 40%
 gross


margin
 profile
 for
 all
 of
 the
 AI
 data


centers.


Thanks.


>> Your
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 the
 line


of
 Tyler
 Ratkkey
 with
 City.
 Please
 go


ahead.


>> Yes,
 thank
 you
 for
 taking
 the
 question.


And
 this
 question's
 uh
 for
 for
 Larry
 or


Clay.
 So,
 Oracle
 has
 clearly
 established


itself
 as
 a
 leading
 provider
 uh
 for
 for


AI
 infrastructure
 to
 AI
 labs
 and
 in
 some


cases
 enterprise
 clients.
 How
 are
 you


thinking
 about
 the
 opportunity
 uh
 to


sell
 additional
 platform
 services
 such


as
 database,
 middleware,
 other
 pieces
 of


the
 portfolio
 similar
 to
 how
 we
 saw
 uh


cloud
 providers
 add
 that
 on
 at
 the
 early


days
 of
 the
 public
 cloud
 space
 and
 what


might
 be
 some
 of
 the
 similarities
 or


differences
 that
 you
 see
 uh
 with
 the


emerging
 AI
 platform
 as
 a
 service
 market


uh
 versus
 the
 traditional
 cloud
 platform


as
 a
 service
 market.
 Thank
 you.


Well,
 let
 me
 start
 with
 traditional


cloud
 and
 traditional
 Oracle
 database.


So,
 I
 think
 the
 biggest
 change
 we've


made
 there
 uh
 was
 to
 make
 our
 database


available
 uh
 in
 everyone's
 cloud.
 So,


you
 can
 buy
 the
 Oracle
 database
 at


Google
 or
 Amazon


uh
 at
 a
 uh
 it's
 available
 at
 at


Microsoft
 Azure
 uh
 as
 well
 as
 as
 well
 as


OCI.
 So,
 that
 was
 the
 most
 maybe
 that


was
 the
 first
 move
 we
 made.
 uh
 we
 we


call
 it
 we
 call
 it
 multicloud
 and
 we


actually
 embed
 OCI
 data
 centers
 within


uh
 the
 other
 clouds
 uh
 so
 they
 get
 the


latest
 greatest
 uh
 you
 know
 version
 of


the
 Oracle
 database.
 Second
 thing
 we
 did


is
 we
 actually
 converted
 the
 Oracle


database
 or
 added
 capabilities
 to
 the


Oracle
 database
 to
 allow
 you
 to


vectorize
 all
 of
 your
 data.
 Uh
 so
 it's
 a


vector
 database.
 Some
 people
 call
 that


an
 AI
 database.
 Uh
 so
 it's
 designed
 to


make
 data
 available
 to
 models.
 You
 can


then
 once
 you
 vectorize
 your
 data,
 you


can
 place
 AI
 models
 on
 top
 of
 that
 and


the
 AI
 models
 can
 understand
 what's
 in


the
 database
 and
 reason
 with
 the
 data


that's
 in
 the
 database.
 So
 we
 think
 that


combination
 of
 making
 our
 uh
 the
 data
 a


the
 data
 available
 in
 our
 database
 also


accessible
 by
 AI
 models
 dramatically
 in


increases
 the
 value
 of
 the
 data.
 We


think
 that's
 very
 so
 far
 none
 of
 the


other
 largecale
 databases
 have
 been
 able


to
 do
 that.
 Uh
 we
 we
 can
 do
 that
 not
 we


can
 do
 that
 and
 keep
 your
 data
 secure.


That's
 one
 of
 the
 bigger
 issues.
 We
 have


to
 scale
 it,
 keep
 your
 keep
 everything


reliable,
 keep
 it
 secure.
 Uh,
 and
 we


actually
 have
 to
 add
 all
 all
 of
 those


capabilities
 and
 features
 to
 the
 Oracle


database.
 So
 that
 was
 step
 two.
 First,


multicloud.
 Second,
 vectorize
 all
 the


data
 and
 make
 it
 accessible
 uh
 by
 uh
 uh


you
 know
 all
 all
 of
 the
 popular
 AI


models.
 Third
 step,
 well,
 you
 know,
 it's


great
 that
 we're
 making
 the
 Oracle
 data,


Oracle
 database
 data
 uh
 data
 available


to
 these
 AI
 models,
 but
 companies


actually
 have
 data
 that's
 not
 stored
 in


an
 Oracle
 database,
 is
 not
 stored
 in
 an


Oracle
 application.
 So,
 we
 built
 an
 AI


lakehouse
 we
 call
 the
 AI
 data
 platform


that


actually
 points
 to
 and
 vectorizes
 all
 of


your
 data.
 uh
 whether
 it's
 in
 um


an
 object
 store
 in
 different
 clouds,


whether
 it's
 a
 bespoke
 application,


whether
 uh
 it's
 in
 another
 database,
 it


really
 will
 take
 the
 universe
 of
 your


data,
 ve
 catalog
 that
 data,
 vectorize


it,
 and
 allow
 an
 AI
 an
 LLM
 to
 do
 multi


uh
 multi-step
 reasoning
 on
 all
 of
 that


data.
 Now
 the
 thing
 that's
 really


remarkable
 about
 that
 is
 think
 about


asking
 one
 query
 asking
 one
 question
 and


the
 model
 looks
 at
 all
 of
 your
 data.


Normally
 when
 you
 when
 you
 ask
 a


question
 you
 have
 to
 direct
 it
 to
 this


database
 or
 this
 application.
 You
 can't


say
 look
 I
 just
 like
 to
 know
 um
 um
 who


whose
 next
 customer
 I
 I
 should
 be


selling
 to.
 Uh
 I'm
 a
 salesperson
 in


territory.
 I'm
 looking
 I
 want
 to
 look
 at


all
 the
 accounts
 in
 my
 territory
 uh
 and


I
 want
 to
 uh
 see
 who's
 the
 best
 prospect


in
 my
 territory.
 Well,
 that
 means


looking
 at
 contractual
 data
 means


looking
 at
 public
 publicly
 available


data.
 That
 means
 looking
 at
 looking
 at


our
 sales
 system
 at
 our
 support
 system,


all
 of
 these
 separate
 systems.
 Well,


suddenly
 all
 of
 that
 data
 is
 unified.
 We


take
 all
 of
 your
 data
 and
 unify
 it.
 So


you
 can
 ask
 a
 single
 question
 and
 it
 can


and
 the
 and
 the
 AI
 models
 can
 find
 the


answer
 to
 that
 question
 regardless
 of


what
 data
 store
 it's
 in.
 That's
 really
 a


unique
 proposition
 and
 we
 think
 that


thing
 is
 going
 to
 turbocharge
 uh
 the
 use


of
 our
 database
 and
 and
 the
 use
 of
 our


cloud
 dramatically.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Your
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 the
 line


of
 Brent
 with
 Jeff
 and
 Company.
 Please


go
 ahead.


Uh
 thanks
 a
 question
 for
 uh
 Larry
 and


and
 uh
 Clay
 on
 uh
 the
 fungeability
 of


your
 infrastructure.
 Um
 what
 would
 you


have
 to
 do
 to
 convert
 a
 data
 center
 from


one
 customer
 to
 another
 such
 as
 if
 one


of
 the
 larger
 customers
 was
 unable
 to


pay?


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 thanks
 thanks
 Brent.
 So
 I
 I


think
 the
 first
 thing
 to
 understand
 is


that
 um
 what
 we
 deliver
 for
 our
 AI


infrastructure
 is
 exactly
 the
 same
 cloud


that
 we
 deliver
 uh
 for
 all
 of
 our


customers.
 Um
 you
 know
 we
 made
 specific


choices
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 OCI
 around


bare
 metal
 virtualization
 and
 the
 way
 in


which
 we
 um
 do
 things
 like
 secure
 wipe


of
 hardware
 etc.
 Um,
 but
 the
 reason
 I


bring
 that
 up
 is
 that
 uh
 take
 as
 an


example,
 you
 you
 anyone
 right
 now
 with
 a


credit
 card
 can
 show
 up
 and
 sign
 up
 for


any
 one
 of
 those
 hundreds
 of
 regions


that
 I
 talked
 about
 earlier
 and
 you
 can


spin
 up
 a
 bare
 metal
 computer
 uh
 in
 as


as
 quickly
 as
 a
 few
 minutes
 and
 at
 the


end
 of
 that
 you
 can
 turn
 it
 off
 and
 I


will
 recycle
 that
 and
 I
 can
 hand
 it
 to


another
 customer
 uh
 you
 know
 in
 less


than
 an
 hour.
 And
 so
 when
 you
 ask
 the


question
 of
 well
 how
 how
 long
 does
 it


take
 to
 transfer
 capacity
 from
 one


customer
 to
 another
 it's
 on
 the
 order
 of


hours.
 Um
 and
 you
 know
 what
 what


actually
 I
 think
 is
 kind
 of
 a
 correlary


to
 that
 question
 is
 is
 well
 then
 how


long
 does
 it
 take
 customers
 to
 adopt
 it?


And
 thankfully
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of


experience
 getting
 uh
 you
 know
 more
 than


700
 AI
 customers
 on
 our
 platform


including
 the
 vast
 majority
 of
 the
 large


model
 providers
 already
 run
 on
 OCI
 and


when
 we
 give
 them
 capacity
 they


typically
 spin
 that
 capacity
 up
 in
 the


order
 of
 uh
 you
 know
 two
 two
 to
 three


days.
 Um
 and
 so
 when
 I
 think
 about
 how


long
 does
 it
 take
 for
 me
 to
 uh
 you
 know


take
 capacity
 hand
 customer
 um
 it
 is
 not


a
 laborious
 process.
 It
 is
 not
 a
 unique


process.
 And
 something
 else
 I
 would
 say


that
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 don't


realize
 about
 our
 cloud
 is
 this
 is


actually
 happening
 all
 the
 time.
 So,
 you


know,
 we
 have
 lots
 of
 customers
 that


might
 sign
 up
 for
 a
 few
 a
 thousand
 of


one
 type
 of
 GPU
 and
 then
 they'll
 come


back
 and
 say,
 well,
 actually,
 you
 know,


I'd
 like
 to
 get
 uh
 even
 more
 capacity


somewhere
 else.
 Will
 you
 take
 this
 back?


And
 we
 do
 that
 all
 day
 every
 day.
 And


we're
 constantly
 moving
 customers
 around


and
 uh
 you
 know,
 adding
 aggregate
 net


capacity.
 So
 um
 we
 have
 the
 technology


we
 have
 a
 secure
 base
 from
 which
 to
 do


that
 and
 we
 also
 have
 a
 customer
 base
 of


a
 lot
 of
 demand
 such
 that
 whenever
 we


find
 ourselves
 with
 capacity
 that's
 not


being
 used
 it
 very
 quickly
 gets
 uh
 gets


allocated
 and
 provisioned.


>> Your
 next
 question
 comes
 from
 the
 line


of
 Mark
 Murdler
 with
 Sanford
 Bernstein.


Please
 go
 ahead.


>> Thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 taking
 my


question
 and
 congrats
 on
 the
 quarter.
 Um


Doug,
 you
 gave
 some
 color
 earlier


tonight
 that
 I'd
 like
 to
 dig
 in
 on.
 Clay


presented
 a
 slide
 at
 the
 financial


analyst
 meeting
 where
 he
 showed
 the


revenue
 and
 expenses
 for
 a
 single
 data


center.
 Doug
 and
 Clay,
 can
 you
 talk


about
 the
 cash
 flow
 for
 that
 same
 data


center
 starting
 with
 the
 commitment
 for


the
 data
 center
 and
 then
 the
 hardware


and
 how
 that
 ca
 that
 flows
 into
 becoming


cash
 flow
 positive.
 Um
 and
 then
 how
 that


rolls
 up
 across
 multiple
 data
 centers.


Any
 color
 would
 be
 really
 appreciated.


>> Sure.
 H
 happy
 to
 answer
 Mark.
 So
 so
 as


we
 talked
 about
 earlier
 in
 this
 call
 uh


it
 starts
 with
 the
 actual
 data
 center


itself
 and
 the
 power
 capacity
 along
 with


it.
 And
 uh
 the
 way
 in
 which
 we
 structure


that
 is
 that
 we
 incur
 no
 cash
 expenses


until
 that's
 fully
 uh
 fully
 delivered


and
 provisioned
 and
 fit
 for
 purpose.
 Um


so
 then
 it's
 really
 comes
 down
 to
 what


is
 the
 cash
 flow
 look
 like
 for
 the


capacity
 that's
 going
 inside
 the
 data


center
 and
 as
 I
 as
 I
 talked
 about


earlier
 that
 really
 depends
 on
 uh
 kind


of
 the
 business
 model
 and
 the
 financial


model
 that
 we
 we've
 used
 procuring
 that


in
 some
 cases
 uh
 customers
 actually
 want


to
 bring
 their
 own
 hardware
 in
 which


case
 we
 don't
 have
 any
 capital
 expense


and
 it's
 really
 around
 you
 know
 um
 uh


the
 the
 data
 center
 itself
 possibly
 some


networking
 gear
 as
 well
 as
 as
 human


labor
 cost.
 We
 have
 other
 models
 where


uh
 vendors
 want
 to
 you
 know
 rent
 that


capacity
 in
 which
 case
 those
 rent


payments
 start
 when
 the
 capacity
 is


provisioned
 for
 the
 customer
 and
 so


customer
 you
 know
 cash
 flow
 comes
 in
 uh


we're
 then
 taking
 that
 cash
 flow
 and
 and


pushing
 that
 out
 uh
 to
 all
 of
 the


different
 suppliers
 and
 then
 obviously


you've
 got
 the
 model
 where
 Oracle
 uh


takes
 own
 cash
 pays
 upfront
 for
 the


hardware
 and
 then
 puts
 the
 the
 capacity


in.
 that's
 obviously
 the
 most
 cash


intensive
 upfront.
 Um,
 and
 then
 there's


depreciation
 schedule
 over
 the
 next


several
 years.
 So,
 uh,
 it
 really
 depends


on
 the
 exact
 business
 and
 financial


model
 used
 for
 each
 of
 the
 data
 centers.


Um,
 and
 then
 you
 ask,
 well,
 how
 do
 they


layer
 together?
 Well,
 thankfully
 they're


they're
 not
 uh
 we
 don't
 need
 calculus


for
 this
 one.
 Um,
 basic
 basic
 arithmetic


is
 enough
 because
 they
 they
 actually


just
 layer
 on
 top
 of
 each
 other.
 Um,
 so


if
 you
 have
 a
 a
 time
 schedule
 for
 one


data
 center
 and
 a
 time
 schedule
 for
 a


second
 data
 center,
 the
 cash
 flows
 add


together.
 Um,
 and
 obviously
 if
 if
 a
 data


center
 comes
 in
 sooner,
 uh,
 you'll
 have


the
 expenses
 as
 well
 as
 the
 revenue


coming
 in
 sooner.
 If
 the
 data
 center


moves
 out,
 then
 the
 expenses
 and
 the


revenue
 also
 move
 out.


>> That's
 very
 helpful.
 I
 appreciate
 it.


>> Your
 final
 question
 comes
 from
 Don


Deuchcci
 with
 Guggenheim
 Securities.


Please
 go
 ahead.


Okay,
 I
 won't
 make
 you
 kiss
 my
 ring.


It's
 it's
 actually
 John
 Duchcci.
 Um,


anyway,
 I'm
 sorry.
 Listen,
 a
 lot
 of
 my


questions
 on
 infrastructure
 have
 already


been
 asked.


>> What
 is
 happening?


>> Really
 important
 questions
 because


that's
 that's
 a
 big
 part
 of
 that's
 your


your
 big
 part
 of
 your
 growth.
 Um,
 but
 I


have
 a
 question
 on
 the
 applications


business.
 Mike,
 you
 said
 applications


are
 going
 to
 accelerate
 this
 year.
 Why


the
 confidence
 in
 this
 business
 when
 all


your
 large
 SAS
 peers
 are
 seeing
 just
 the


opposite
 where
 growth
 is
 decelerating


especially
 because
 you
 know
 we
 thought


that
 something
 similar
 about
 Oracle's


application
 business
 last
 year
 and
 we


didn't
 really
 start
 to
 see
 it
 until
 the


fourth
 quarter.
 We've
 heard
 some
 things


in
 the
 field
 around
 one
 oracle
 your
 go


to
 market
 motion
 where
 apps
 and


infrastructure
 are
 more
 combined
 versus


separate
 and
 you
 also
 talked
 about


combining
 vertical
 and
 horizontal
 apps


teams
 here
 is
 that
 it
 is
 it
 mostly
 go
 to


market
 is
 there
 something
 more
 about
 the


products
 or
 something
 else
 that
 we


should
 be
 thinking
 about
 thank
 you


>> well
 yep
 thanks
 for
 the
 question
 first
 I


think
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 combination
 of


things
 but
 let
 me
 just
 start
 with
 what
 I


think
 is
 happening
 in
 the
 industry
 all


of
 our
 competitors
 are
 largely
 in
 the


best
 of
 breed
 business
 because
 they're


not
 in
 the
 applications
 business
 in


totality.
 They're
 not
 in
 the
 back
 office


business.
 They're
 not
 in
 the
 industry


business.
 And
 they're
 not
 in
 everything


in
 between.
 They're
 not
 in
 the
 front
 of


the
 house,
 the
 back
 of
 the
 house,
 in
 the


middle
 of
 the
 house.
 We
 are
 the
 only


applications
 company
 in
 the
 world
 that's


selling
 complete
 application
 suites.


Then
 you
 add
 in
 bakedin
 AI,
 uh
 the
 AI


halo,
 baked
 in
 AI
 right
 into
 right
 into


our
 application.
 So
 we're
 over
 400
 AI


features
 live
 in
 Fusion
 already.
 I


mentioned
 274
 customers
 live
 on
 our


clinical
 AI
 agent.
 The
 you
 know
 the
 go


lives
 for
 these
 clinical
 AI
 agents
 which


are
 a
 new
 breed
 of
 SAS
 applications
 for


us
 are
 measured
 in
 the
 matter
 of
 weeks.


And
 you're
 looking
 in
 an
 industry
 like


healthcare
 where
 it
 would
 take
 months
 or


years
 to
 get
 anything
 done
 of
 that


magnitude
 weeks.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 John,


the
 customers
 are
 implementing
 these


things
 all
 by
 themselves.
 They
 they


don't
 need
 us
 to
 help
 them.
 You
 just


roll
 them
 out
 and
 they
 work.
 So
 we're
 in


the
 we're
 in
 we're
 in
 the
 applications


industry
 suite
 business.
 We're
 building


AI
 into
 our
 back
 office
 applications,


our
 front
 office
 applications
 and
 we
 are


building
 applications
 that
 are
 also
 AI


agents
 themselves
 that
 are
 in
 fact
 AI


agents.
 That's
 why
 you
 see
 the
 growth


rates
 in
 our
 industry
 applications
 up


21%
 in
 the
 quarter.
 Our
 fusion
 fusion


ERP's
 up
 17%,
 SCM
 up
 18%,
 HCM
 up
 14%,
 CX


up
 12%.
 Again,
 all
 on
 a
 bigger
 base.


Then
 I
 think
 the
 next
 piece
 of
 this
 is


you
 add
 in
 the
 AI
 data
 platform.
 So
 if


you'd
 like
 an
 industry
 suite
 of


applications,
 then
 you'd
 like
 to
 create


your
 own
 AI
 agents.
 You'd
 like
 to
 create


and
 unlock
 your
 own
 enterprise
 data
 on


top
 of
 it
 all.
 Um
 we
 are
 the
 only


all
 of
 those
 ingredients
 for
 for
 a


customer.
 And
 I
 think
 as
 you
 as
 you
 look


at
 customers,
 you
 know,
 tiring
 of
 spend


on
 best
 of
 breed
 because
 the
 integration


costs
 are
 so
 high
 and
 it's
 hard
 to
 bolt


AI
 onto
 all
 that
 because
 you're
 actually


not
 retiring
 anything
 in
 the
 process.
 Uh


we're
 in
 a
 very
 unique
 position
 and
 I


think
 we're
 starting
 to
 see
 the
 numbers


too,
 John,
 with
 the
 deferred
 revenue
 for


apps
 growing
 at
 14%
 now.
 Um
 you
 know,


faster
 than
 the
 inquarter
 revenue
 growth


of
 11%.
 Uh
 for
 all
 those
 reasons
 I'm


optimistic
 on
 our
 apps
 business
 going


forward
 that
 it's
 a
 continued
 growth


vision
 for
 Oracle.


>> Thank
 you
 Mike.
 When
 I
 when
 you
 as
 you


were
 talking
 I
 sort
 of
 clarified
 in
 my


mind
 when
 I
 think
 of
 one
 Oracle
 I
 used


to
 think
 of
 I
 thought
 of
 it
 when
 I


started
 to
 hear
 about
 it
 as
 as
 a
 go
 to


market
 motion
 but
 it's
 more
 than
 that.


It's
 actually
 a
 it's
 a
 product
 thing


too.
 It's
 everything.
 So
 thanks
 a
 lot.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you
 John.


A
 telephonic
 replay
 of
 this
 conference


call
 will
 be
 available
 for
 24
 hours
 on


our
 investor
 relations.


Well,


that
 was
 Oracle's
 call.


Uh,
 I'll
 go
 first
 and
 then
 we'll
 get


Neil's
 reaction.
 Uh,
 I've
 never
 heard


their
 call
 before.
 For
 those
 that
 have


heard
 the
 call
 before,
 I
 have
 I've
 also


never
 heard
 these
 many
 glitches
 in
 a


call.
 These
 many
 random
 beeps.
 Uh
 there


is
 a
 universal
 sound
 for
 those
 that
 have


an
 iPhone
 on
 when
 someone
 sends
 a
 text


or
 or
 receives
 a
 text.
 We
 heard
 that


multiple
 times.
 I
 guess
 they
 left
 it
 on


speaker
 phone
 and
 they
 were
 near
 the


mic.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 fine
 to
 be
 texting


during
 an
 earnings
 call.
 Just
 don't
 have


it
 on
 the
 speaker
 where
 thousands
 of


investors
 are
 listening
 to.
 Um,
 and
 then


in
 terms
 of
 the
 questions
 and


commentary,
 I
 mean,
 my
 my
 simple


takeaway
 was
 there
 was
 zero
 excitement


from
 the
 CEOs,
 the
 co-CEOs
 or
 Larry


Ellson
 on
 what
 they're
 doing
 with
 AI.


And
 it's
 very
 weird
 because
 RPO
 is
 up


$70
 billion
 quarter
 overquarter.
 So,
 you


would
 think
 you
 would
 get
 excitement,


energy,
 enthusiasm,
 and
 just
 like
 this


broader
 understanding
 of,
 hey,
 like
 this


is
 our
 market
 to
 win
 and
 we
 are
 going
 to


win.
 And
 I
 didn't
 get
 that.


Stocks
 down
 11%,
 you
 can't
 just
 say
 it's


from
 the
 earnings
 itself.
 They
 beat
 EPS


by
 40%.
 So
 maybe
 it's
 a
 bit
 of
 an


overreaction.
 I
 do
 think
 the
 the
 way


they
 answered
 questions
 maybe
 wasn't


conducive
 to
 the
 street.
 The
 one
 good


thing
 they
 said
 we
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


pump
 to
 202
 was
 when
 um
 they
 said
 we're


going
 to
 be
 having
 substantially
 less


than
 a hundred
 billion
 dollars
 that
 is


going to
 be
 needed
 to
 finance
 building


up
 the
 data
 centers.
 What
 does
 that


mean?
 Is
 it
 80
 billion,
 70
 billion?
 They


already
 issued
 40
 billion
 of
 debt.
 Will


they
 issue
 another
 20
 billion?
 60


billion
 is
 still
 substantially
 less
 than


100
 billion.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think


that
 call
 was
 an
 absolute
 mess
 and
 I


don't
 have
 any
 more
 clarity.
 And
 I
 agree


with
 Bruce
 Shield
 in
 the
 chat
 who
 was


saying
 that
 it's
 almost
 like
 Oracle
 was


was
 discussing
 uh
 rag
 as
 like
 some


proprietary
 amazing
 form
 of
 AI
 as
 a
 as


an
 ecosystem
 for
 you
 know
 margin


efficiencies
 and
 and
 and
 productivity.


And
 it's
 like
 retrieval
 augmented


generation
 that
 that
 stuff
 has
 been


around
 for
 a
 while.
 So
 it's
 not
 like


that
 was
 the
 most
 exciting
 uh
 in
 the


context
 of
 what
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 AI.


Neil,
 what
 were
 your
 thoughts
 on
 this


entire
 call?


>> Yeah,
 so
 a
 couple
 of
 things.
 First
 of


all,
 the
 the
 EPS
 stuff.
 Um
 so
 the
 big


beat
 is
 because
 of
 the
 recognition
 of


pre-tax
 gains
 of
 $2.7
 billion
 of
 the


quarter
 for
 the
 sale
 of
 uh
 Mier.
 So


okay,


>> I
 did
 not
 know
 that.
 That's
 a
 big
 deal.


>> Okay,
 that's
 a
 big
 one.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I


was
 I
 was
 I
 was
 looking
 for
 that
 in
 the


press
 release.
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 found
 it,


but
 they
 they
 basically
 say
 that
 said


that
 at
 the
 start
 of
 this
 uh
 of
 this


earnings
 call.
 Then
 the
 $100
 billion


stuff.
 I
 am
 I
 am
 looking
 at
 the
 exact


thing
 that
 they're
 saying.
 They
 said


um
 what
 we
 see
 right
 now,
 we
 expect
 we


will
 need
 less
 if
 not
 substantially


less.


Okay,
 cool.
 But
 that
 that
 doesn't


confirm
 a
 lot,
 I
 would
 say.
 Um,
 and
 then


yeah,
 I
 mean,
 like
 like
 you
 said,
 I


don't
 know.
 I
 had
 a
 feeling
 that
 this


this
 was
 more
 of
 a
 a
 call
 you
 have


during,
 I
 don't know,
 a
 product
 day
 or


an
 analyst
 uh
 an
 analyst
 conference.


Like,
 I
 I
 don't
 care
 what
 you
 do
 with


your
 your
 Oracle
 apps
 or
 or
 whatn
 not.


This
 is
 an
 earnings
 call.
 Speak
 about


numbers.
 um
 speak
 about
 how
 how
 fast
 you


you
 expect
 this
 thing
 to
 to
 be
 built


out.
 Exactly.
 Maybe.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 They


give
 the
 stock
 took
 a
 huge
 hit
 when
 they


suddenly
 announced
 suddenly
 it's
 going


to
 be
 $15
 billion
 extra
 in
 capex.
 That


that
 I
 mean
 that's
 that's
 quite
 a
 big


increase
 from
 3
 months
 ago
 that
 you
 you


didn't
 uh
 you
 didn't
 acknowledge.
 But
 in


three
 months
 that
 things
 went
 up
 by
 15


billion.
 But
 okay,
 they
 they
 said
 it's


because
 they
 they
 are
 moving
 faster.


that
 they
 could
 be
 recognizing
 revenue


uh
 earlier
 because
 there
 were
 a
 couple


of
 I
 mean
 the
 problem
 with
 these


earnings
 calls
 is
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 the


times
 the
 good
 questions
 get
 asked
 but


they
 don't
 get
 answered
 right
 they


suddenly
 the
 dude
 it's
 like
 Amazon
 not


this
 time
 but
 three
 months
 ago
 it's
 like


asking
 good
 question
 and
 then
 Jasse
 and


the
 other
 guy
 like
 talking
 for
 10


minutes
 on
 something
 that
 would
 wasn't


even
 asked.
 So
 again,
 in
 this
 case,
 it's


it's
 more
 blah
 blah
 blah
 blah
 blah.
 But


yes,
 uh
 here
 expect
 fiscal
 26
 capex
 will


be
 about
 $15
 billion
 higher
 than
 we


forecasted
 after
 Q1.


But
 I
 I
 I
 guess


um
 this
 is
 because
 yeah,
 they
 want
 to


monetize
 RPO
 faster
 than
 previously


expected,
 which
 okay,
 fine.
 um


throughout
 the
 earnings
 call
 they
 then


explain
 the
 the
 various
 ways
 for
 for


them
 to
 to
 to
 recognize
 and


sometimes
 the
 client
 will
 come
 in
 with


the
 chips,
 sometimes
 they
 will
 not,


sometimes
 they
 will
 rent
 it
 out,


sometimes
 they
 will
 not.
 I'm
 like,
 okay,


you're
 not
 telling
 me
 something
 new,


something
 that
 the
 rest
 isn't
 doing,


right?
 Nebu
 say
 cororeweave,
 it's
 also


the
 same.
 It's
 like
 they're
 paying
 for


for
 the
 bare
 metal
 and
 yes,
 they
 will


come
 in
 with
 their
 own
 chips.
 Um,
 so


I
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 know.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 this
 is


bearish
 Oracle
 by
 any
 sense.
 The
 call


was
 definitely
 bearish
 and
 the
 stock
 is


reacting
 bearish,
 but
 I
 mean
 it
 does
 get


to
 a
 point
 if
 this
 thing
 gets
 anywhere


near
 that
 175
 180
 range,
 it
 probably


gets
 a
 bounce,
 but
 it
 was
 just
 not,
 I


think,
 what
 the
 street
 wanted
 to
 hear.


Even
 though,
 as
 you
 said,
 they
 increase


capex,
 which
 should
 be
 good
 for
 Nvidia.


Nvidia's
 down.
 The
 street
 doesn't
 like


that.
 Nebius
 and
 Corore
 wee
 all
 the
 data


center
 plays
 going
 down
 because
 I
 mean


they
 are
 kind
 of
 correlated
 with


Oracle's
 business
 model
 and
 and
 with


their
 business
 practices
 in
 terms
 of
 the


debt
 financing


and
 you
 know
 if
 the
 if
 the
 biggest
 debt


issuer
 is
 not
 really
 giving
 you
 the


stuff
 you
 want
 to
 hear
 then
 core
 and


Irene
 Nebus
 are
 going to
 get
 hit.
 Corre


down
 3%
 after
 hours
 down
 2%
 and
 then


Neb's
 down
 2%
 as
 well.
 Um


yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 I
 agree
 with
 with
 what


Neil
 said.
 Oracle
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 very
 important
 player


in
 cloud
 computing
 and
 the
 increase
 of


capex
 the
 RPO
 growth
 all
 that
 is


positive
 but
 this
 call
 was
 not
 a
 call


where
 they
 like
 did
 you
 even
 hear


someone
 mentioned
 in
 the
 chat
 I
 didn't


even
 hear
 like
 agents
 or
 agentic


workflows
 or
 like
 meaningful
 discussion


around
 the
 future
 of
 enterprise


workflows
 in
 the
 context
 of
 agents
 we


heard
 about
 very
 old
 concepts
 in
 AI
 like


rag
 and
 you
 know
 Larry
 Ellson
 talked


about
 how
 you
 know
 the
 data
 needs
 to
 be


secure
 and
 confidential
 it's
 like
 dude


like
 we
 we've
 heard
 this
 many
 times
 like


yes
 we
 get
 it
 you
 guys
 are
 going
 to


protect
 the
 data
 it's
 like
 okay
 what's


the
 next
 step
 right
 like
 how
 do
 you


really
 make
 this
 make
 more
 sense
 and
 and


maybe
 they're
 getting
 tired
 of


explaining
 it
 and
 you
 know
 it's
 been
 two


and
 a
 half
 years
 and
 you
 know
 most


investors
 kind
 of
 know
 how
 the
 story
 is


playing
 out
 and
 you're
 seeing
 it
 in
 some


of
 the
 numbers
 but
 this
 was
 not
 a
 call


to
 incite
 a
 lot
 of
 confidence
 or


excitement
 for
 someone
 who's
 new
 to


Oracle
 like
 myself
 in
 terms
 of
 listening


to
 their
 first
 call
 ever
 and
 be
 like
 man


this
 is
 a
 name
 that
 has
 to
 be
 in
 the


portfolio
 over
 the
 next
 10
 years
 when
 it


comes
 or
 at least
 next
 10
 months
 when
 it


comes
 to
 AI
 growth.


That's
 probably
 why
 the
 stock
 is
 down


10%.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 yeah,
 I
 I


the
 me
 the
 messaging
 here
 again
 a
 lot


about
 messaging
 because
 the
 numbers
 are


there.
 It's
 either
 they
 they're
 not
 sure


about
 the
 upcoming
 12
 months
 even
 though


they
 are
 still
 giving
 us
 certain
 numbers


but


it
 wasn't
 clear.
 It's
 like
 I
 I
 was


listening
 to
 an
 earnings
 call
 where


okay,
 now
 I'm
 even
 more
 confused
 than


than
 what
 I
 was
 two
 hours
 or
 an
 hour
 or


so
 ago.
 The
 numbers
 are
 there.
 They


wrote
 the
 RPO
 is
 there,
 but
 again,
 give


us
 a
 little
 bit
 more.
 Like,
 oh,
 thank


you
 for
 the
 added
 color.
 What
 added


color?
 What
 what
 added?
 I
 I
 just
 got


more
 confused
 by
 by
 what
 they
 were


saying
 every
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 they


answered
 two
 questions
 the
 exact
 same


way,
 which
 I
 also
 found.
 Okay,
 thank
 you


for
 no
 added
 color
 in
 this
 case.
 Um,
 but


yeah,
 it's
 more
 confusing
 than
 anything


else.
 It's
 not
 bearish
 on
 the
 name,


right?
 It's
 not
 like,
 oh,
 there
 is
 no


revenue
 coming
 in
 or
 they're
 not


growing.
 They
 are
 growing.
 It's
 just
 the


the
 we
 didn't
 get
 much


valuable
 information
 from
 them.
 Like
 if


if
 I
 wanted
 to
 learn
 more
 about
 the


Oracle
 product,
 I
 would
 go
 and
 and
 look


at
 some
 of
 their
 blog
 posts
 or
 or


YouTube
 videos
 or
 whatnot.
 I
 would
 not


be
 listening
 to
 an
 earnings
 call.
 I'm


listening
 to
 the
 earnings
 call
 to
 hear


more
 about
 the
 half
 a
 trillion
 dollars


in
 RPO
 that
 you
 are
 talking
 about
 and


and
 and
 how
 that
 will
 well
 flow
 from
 the


top
 to
 the
 bottom
 lines
 for
 you.
 But
 uh


yeah
 uh
 apparently


>> also
 I
 guess


>> someone
 asked
 like
 hey
 what
 happens
 to


your
 RPO
 if
 one
 customer
 can't
 come


through?
 They
 didn't
 they
 didn't
 the


analysts
 I
 think
 had
 a
 little
 bit
 of


respect
 and
 didn't
 want
 to
 say
 what


happens
 if
 OpenAI
 can't
 pay
 you.
 So
 they


kind
 of
 framed
 it
 politically
 in
 a
 in
 a


more
 correct
 way
 and
 they
 didn't
 have
 an


answer.
 They
 had
 some
 nonsense
 about
 how


well
 we're
 diversifying.
 Yeah.
 It's
 like


no
 dude
 if
 Open
 AI
 can't
 come
 through


with
 the
 money
 what
 happens
 and
 I
 think


that's
 when
 the
 stock
 took
 an
 even


bigger
 dip.
 So
 I
 agree
 with
 you.
 I
 don't


think
 they
 really
 gave
 any
 clarity
 and


they
 did
 not
 give
 you
 I
 mean
 if
 you're


an
 AI
 company
 in
 this
 world
 in
 this


market
 and
 you're
 telling
 us
 you
 have
 a


half
 a
 billion
 of
 RPO
 on
 the
 books
 and


then
 you're
 not
 getting
 people
 excited


for
 how
 you're
 going
 to
 monetize
 it
 or


>> sorry
 half
 a
 trillion
 or
 clarify
 how


that
 half
 a
 trillion
 actually
 ends
 up


coming
 to
 shareholders
 through
 you
 know


the
 bottom
 line
 net
 income
 it
 is
 a


little
 hard
 to
 be
 like
 all
 right
 I'm


going
 to
 be
 long
 this
 stock
 I
 would


rather
 just
 buy
 more
 Nvidia


or
 a
 core
 or
 a
 nebus
 because
 they
 have


been
 quite
 clear
 how
 they
 are
 going
 to


recognize
 and
 how
 much
 they're
 going
 to


recognize
 and
 how
 much
 they're
 going
 to


generate
 12
 months
 from
 now.
 Yes,
 it's


also
 capex
 heavy
 but
 they
 explain
 it
 in


a
 very
 very
 simple
 way.
 It's
 like
 okay


we
 are
 going
 to
 need
 this
 amount
 of


money.
 This
 is
 the
 ARR
 exit
 rate
 for


next
 year.
 This
 is
 our
 backlog.
 This
 is


the
 new
 contract
 for
 for
 Nebus
 with


Microsoft
 and
 Meta
 and
 and
 that's
 it.
 At


least
 we
 know
 what's
 going
 on
 here.
 It's


I
 don't
 know
 may
 maybe
 they
 I
 don't
 know


they
 maybe
 Larry
 was
 too
 busy
 with
 the


Paramount
 stuff.
 I
 don't
 know
 even


though
 it's
 it's
 his
 it's
 his
 kid
 but
 um


but
 yeah
 I
 don't
 know.
 It's
 it's
 it's
 a


strange
 earnings
 call
 where
 they
 they


just
 seems
 like
 they
 they
 woke
 up
 like


two
 hours
 ago
 and
 like
 ah
 god
 damn
 it.


Let's
 go
 and
 chat
 GPT.
 uh
 summarize
 the


earnings
 call
 for
 me
 uh
 quickly
 and
 they


used
 fast
 instead
 of
 thinking
 and
 this


is
 what
 we
 got.
 This
 is
 basically
 it.


>> I
 would
 agree
 that
 I
 mean
 that
 earnings


call
 did
 seem
 like
 it
 got
 freaking


summarized
 by
 Chad
 GBT
 because
 there
 was


no
 nuance
 or
 excitement
 or
 just
 original


thought
 I
 think
 that
 we
 got
 out
 of
 this


one.
 In
 fact,
 the
 most
 important
 thing


we
 had,
 which
 is
 what
 Neil
 tweeted
 about


during
 the
 call,
 by
 the
 way,
 this
 is
 uh


Neil's
 YouTube.
 So,
 for
 those
 that
 are


on
 my
 channel,
 if
 you
 are
 not
 subscribed


to
 Neil,
 please
 make
 sure
 you
 subscribe


to
 him.
 Uh
 we
 will
 be
 collaborating


in
 the
 future
 on
 some
 calls.
 Neil,
 do
 we


want
 to
 do
 broadcast?
 You
 can
 let
 me


know.
 We
 might
 be
 able
 to
 do
 Broadcom


tomorrow,
 but
 that
 will
 also
 be
 a
 big


one.
 Yeah,
 we
 usually
 do
 pretty
 much
 all


the
 big
 AI
 ones,
 including
 Nvidia.
 Uh


this
 was
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 I


think
 that
 happened.
 Times
 person
 of
 the


year
 which
 people
 have
 been
 predicting


on
 the
 prediction
 markets
 for
 for
 the


past
 month
 now
 is
 AI
 architects.


So
 that's
 who
 you
 got
 for
 person
 of
 the


year.
 Neil,
 what
 was
 your
 reaction
 to


the
 conglomerate
 of
 people
 they
 picked?


>> I
 mean
 the
 my
 reaction
 is
 is
 what
 is


what
 I
 wrote.
 Where
 where
 is
 where
 is
 my


my
 guy
 Sundar
 Sundar
 Pitch
 AI?
 Um,
 but


yeah.
 Okay.
 They
 they
 put
 their
 Demis


from
 uh
 Deep
 Mind.
 So
 I
 guess
 I
 guess


that's
 fine.
 Um,
 we've
 got
 Zucker,
 Sasu,


Elon,
 Jensen.
 You
 see
 Elon
 not
 next
 to


Sam
 Alman.
 That
 was
 uh


they
 put
 Jensen
 in
 the
 middle
 the
 middle


of
 the
 two.
 Then
 you
 have
 Demis.
 Then


you
 have
 uh
 Entropic
 Guy.
 And
 who
 who's


the
 last
 who's
 the
 last
 person?


The
 lady,
 right?
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 who
 the


Who's
 that
 lady?


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 know.
 Lisa
 Sue.


I
 don't
 know
 who
 the
 other
 lady
 is.
 Uh


let
 let
 us
 know
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 you
 know.


But
 I
 guess
 they
 couldn't
 pick
 someone


to
 be
 the
 person
 of
 the
 year.
 So
 they


just
 picked
 all
 the
 AI
 people


and
 they
 left
 out
 a
 bunch.
 I
 mean


Sundar's
 stock
 is
 up
 70%.
 He's
 beating


everyone
 else
 this
 year.
 They
 don't
 have


Alex
 Carr.
 I
 didn't
 expect
 Alex
 Carr,


but
 still
 like
 he's
 pretty
 important


when
 it
 comes
 to
 AI.


Fay
 Fay,
 she's
 a
 top
 AI
 researcher.


All right.
 Well,
 that
 is
 Times


person
 of
 the
 year.
 AI
 architects


is
 what
 we
 got.


That's
 it.


All right,
 folks.
 I
 think
 that
 is
 it
 for


us.
 Uh
 I'll
 be
 live
 tomorrow
 for


Broadcom.
 Uh
 maybe
 Neil
 will
 join
 me,


but
 if
 not,
 we'll
 still
 be
 discussing


Broadcom.
 I
 think
 that's
 probably
 going


to
 be
 a
 much
 bigger
 one
 than
 Oracle
 and


Adobe
 to
 be
 honest.
 Um
 Adobe
 after
 hours


flat
 Oracle
 getting
 hit.
 I
 wouldn't
 be


surprised
 if
 Oracle
 rebounds
 tomorrow.
 I


mean,
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 it
 still
 is


a
 pretty
 large
 company,
 so
 I
 could
 see


people
 buying
 the
 dip,
 but
 that
 call
 was


just
 not
 the
 most
 exciting.
 Adobe
 right


there
 up
 0.19%.


Uh,
 Lulu
 and
 Broadcom
 are
 tomorrow.
 So,


those
 are
 the
 big
 ones.
 One
 big


retailer,
 Broadcom
 hit
 alltime
 highs


today.
 They
 closed
 at
 all
 time
 highs
 at


412,
 $
 1.95
 trillion
 company.
 I
 think


they're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 pretty
 monster


earnings.
 It's
 just
 that
 one
 is


definitely,


you
 could
 argue,
 price
 for
 perfection.


So,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 what


numbers
 they
 can
 put
 up
 as
 well.


>> I
 think
 we
 have
 Costco
 as
 well
 tomorrow


for
 uh


>> Oh,
 yes.
 Costco
 bigger
 economic
 maybe


data
 type
 of
 thing.
 It's
 going
 to
 be


interesting
 because
 now
 we
 had
 like
 a


dobish
 Jerome
 Powell
 and
 now
 we
 have


Oracle
 maybe
 ruining
 the
 party
 a
 little


bit.
 Uh
 so,
 we'll
 see
 how
 how
 we
 go
 how


we
 open
 tomorrow
 or
 close
 and
 then
 next


week
 with
 CPI
 reports
 is
 next
 week,


right?
 We're
 not
 getting
 PPI.
 We're


going
 getting
 CPI
 next
 week
 for
 now


unless
 it
 gets
 cancelled
 as
 well.


>> Yeah.
 And
 there
 is
 Neil's
 Twitter.
 You


guys
 can
 follow
 him
 there
 as
 well.
 Now,


again,
 in
 terms
 of
 JPAL,
 like
 he
 was


pretty
 damn
 doubbish.
 I
 don't
 think


Oracle,
 and
 I
 know
 some
 people
 in
 the


chat
 said
 Oracle
 uh
 ruined
 the
 Sand


Claus
 rally.
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 go
 that
 far.
 I


I
 think
 there
 I
 think
 JPAL
 really
 set
 us


up
 to
 have
 a
 good
 run
 towards
 the
 end
 of


the
 year.
 Seasonally
 we're
 on
 the
 right


side
 of
 uh
 the
 year
 in
 terms
 of
 a
 rally.


We
 needed
 the
 cut.
 We
 got
 the
 cut.
 We


needed
 a
 dovish
 cut.
 We
 got
 a
 dovish


cut.
 Maybe
 it
 turns
 out
 to
 be
 a
 sell
 the


news
 tomorrow.
 But
 JPAL
 did
 everything


he
 could
 possibly
 do.
 Hopefully
 Hawkan


saves
 us
 tomorrow.
 But
 JPAL
 like
 no
 one


can
 be
 mad
 at
 Pal.
 No
 one.
 I
 mean
 he


said
 everything
 you
 wanted
 to
 say.
 I


mean
 he
 basically
 said
 the
 tariffs
 are
 a


onetime
 issue
 and
 it
 shouldn't
 be


affecting
 inflation.
 The
 whole
 concern


over
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 months,
 the
 past


couple
 weeks
 was
 inflation
 is
 going
 to


matter
 more
 than
 the
 labor
 market.


Clearly,
 he's
 that
 the
 labor
 market


matters
 more
 than
 inflation.
 And
 even


downplayed
 the
 problem
 of
 inflation.


Now,
 maybe
 it's
 because
 he
 wants
 to


secure
 his
 legacy
 as
 the
 guy
 that
 took


inflation
 down
 from
 10%
 to
 2%.
 Which,
 to


be
 fair,
 he
 did.
 I
 mean,
 he's
 done
 a


phenomenal
 job
 over
 the
 past
 couple


years,
 even
 if
 he
 was
 a
 little
 late.
 Uh,


but
 it's
 not
 like
 inflation
 seems
 like


it's
 that
 big
 of
 a
 concern.
 So,
 I
 think


from
 a
 macro
 perspective,
 you've
 got
 the


market
 in
 a
 place
 where
 it
 can
 get
 to


all-time
 highs.
 Oracle,
 it'll
 have
 some


issues
 maybe
 tomorrow
 and
 next
 week
 in


terms
 of
 how
 the
 markets
 think
 about
 AI,


but
 I
 think
 that
 stuff
 gets
 resolved


relatively
 quickly.
 The
 next
 catalyst,
 I


don't
 know,
 Neil,
 I
 guess
 that's
 my
 last


question
 to
 you.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 the


next
 catalyst
 is
 for
 the
 rest
 of


December?
 Or
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 just


season
 seasonal
 to
 potentially
 get


towards
 end
 of
 year
 chasing,
 I
 guess,
 to


get
 to
 end
 of
 year
 highs
 potentially?


>> Yeah,
 probably.
 I
 mean
 if
 the
 CPI
 report


comes
 in
 much
 better
 than
 feared,
 I


guess
 the
 whole
 inflation
 story
 thing
 is


uh
 is
 going
 to
 help
 the
 market
 close
 out


a
 bit
 higher,
 a
 bit
 higher
 because
 we


are
 already
 quite
 high.
 But
 a
 good
 CPI


print


could
 help
 us.
 Hctan
 could
 not
 help
 us


tomorrow
 because
 Hawkan
 is
 the
 basically


like
 the
 anti-
 Nvidia
 story.
 So
 a
 good


Hawk
 10
 Broadcom
 report
 tomorrow
 is


going
 to
 counter
 the
 whole
 GPU
 thing.
 So


you
 might
 you
 might
 not
 want
 to
 have


that
 um
 because
 he's
 in
 the
 Google


Google
 camp
 of
 TPUs
 and
 and
 AS6
 and
 all


of
 that.
 So
 we'll
 see.
 But
 yeah,
 a
 good


CPI
 report,
 I
 guess,
 could
 could
 help
 us


out.
 Um
 but
 I
 mean,
 we
 just
 had
 the


earning
 season.
 Most
 companies
 beat


earnings
 quite
 comfortably.
 Most
 had


good
 guidance
 as
 well.
 So
 it
 seems
 like


the
 companies
 that
 we
 follow
 and
 maybe


even
 own
 are
 doing
 well.
 And
 it
 seems


like
 the
 economy
 is
 doing
 better
 than


feared.
 And
 we
 got
 a
 rate
 cut.
 We
 got
 a


a
 dovish
 power.
 So,
 what
 more
 can
 I
 ask


for?
 Probably
 for
 the
 market
 to
 continue


to
 go
 up,
 but
 okay,
 maybe
 I
 don't
 maybe


not
 being
 that
 greedy,
 but
 you
 you
 asked


the
 question,
 so
 I
 answer.
 I
 hope
 we
 do


we
 do
 end
 the
 year
 even
 higher,


but
 we'll
 see.


All
 right,
 that's
 it
 for
 us.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 4hour
 stream.


We
 had
 PAL,
 we
 had
 Oracle,
 we
 had
 Adobe.


I'll
 be
 live
 for
 the
 market
 open


tomorrow
 and
 then
 we
 will
 have
 um
 we


will
 have
 what's
 the
 other
 one?


Broadcom,
 which
 will
 be
 a
 big
 one.
 And


yeah,
 Neil,
 you
 do
 have
 a
 point.
 I
 mean,


if
 Broadcom
 does
 crush
 it,
 technically


it's
 Parish
 Nvidia,
 but
 hopefully
 it


still
 helps
 the
 broader
 market
 given


Broadcom
 is
 up
 there
 in
 terms
 of


waitings
 for
 the
 S&P.


All right,
 thank
 you
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 We'll
 see
 you
 guys


tomorrow
 and
 thank
 you
 for
 joining.


Bye
 everybody.
