The
 VC's
 incentive
 is
 two
 things.
 One,


get
 the
 best
 return
 so
 that
 you
 can


compete.
 If
 I'm
 only
 earning
 12%
 and
 a


pure
 VC
 is
 earning
 20%,
 money
 is
 going


to
 go
 where
 it's
 going to
 be
 well


treated
 and
 uh
 I'm
 going
 to
 lose
 to


that.
 So,
 the
 cost
 of
 my
 capital
 for
 the


cost
 of
 an
 LP's
 capital
 is


outperformance.
 So,
 I've
 got
 to


outperform,
 which
 means
 I
 have
 to
 be


earlier.
 I
 have
 to
 own
 more.
 I
 can't


just
 do
 stupid
 deals.
 sophisticated
 LPs


will
 not
 just
 look
 at
 the
 logos
 that
 you


have,
 which
 is
 the
 game
 that
 you
 always


>> sophisticated
 LPs


>> from
 mutual
 funds
 and
 from
 some
 hedge


funds.
 You
 know,
 you
 see
 the
 Q4
 filings


and
 they
 always
 threw
 in
 the
 name,
 oh,


we
 were
 in
 Nvidia,
 you
 know,
 and
 they


would
 market
 their
 top
 10
 holdings,
 but


BS,
 you
 know,
 they
 lost
 money
 on
 it,


right?
 And
 so,
 so
 that
 is
 a
 really


important
 incentive.
 And
 the


sophisticated
 LPs
 will
 actually
 know


down
 to
 the
 partner
 at
 the
 firm
 or
 the


team
 or
 the
 deal
 team
 who
 was


responsible
 for
 this,
 what
 was
 the
 entry


point.
 They
 will
 talk
 to
 the
 founders


and
 say,
 "Who
 was
 your
 most
 valuable


investor?
 Who
 got
 you
 your
 first
 10


hires?
 Who
 helped
 with
 your
 syndicate


construction
 for
 your
 later
 rounds?
 Who


made
 customer
 introductions?
 Who
 was
 a


valuable
 board
 member?
 Who
 never
 showed


up?
 Who
 was
 asleep
 in
 the
 board


meetings?"
 All
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 So


there
 is
 a
 level
 of
 due
 diligence
 that


LPs
 have
 to
 do
 to
 know
 are
 you
 a
 value


ad
 investor
 or
 are
 you
 a
 poser
 or


pretender
 that's
 just
 buying
 a
 logo
 or
 a


brand
 name.


[Music]


>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 OddLots
 podcast.
 I'm
 Joe
 Wisenthal


>> and
 I'm
 Tracy
 Aloway.
 You
 know,


sometimes
 uh
 with
 the
 whole
 AI
 thing,
 it


feels
 like
 the
 are
 we
 back?
 Is
 it
 over


thing?
 There's
 been
 a
 few
 moments
 in
 the


last
 year,
 whatever
 was
 like,
 is
 the


bubble
 bursting?
 Is
 there
 a
 bubble?
 I


don't
 know
 where
 what
 this
 week
 is.


We're
 recording
 this
 September
 3rd.


There's
 a
 little
 I
 don't
 know.
 There's


some
 tremors.
 I
 can't
 tell
 what's
 real


or
 not.


>> I
 feel
 like
 the
 hype
 cycles
 get
 shorter


and
 shorter
 and
 more
 compressed.
 Um
 but


you're
 right.
 I
 think
 there
 are
 maybe


some
 more
 jitters
 than
 there
 have
 been


previously.
 Like
 maybe
 only
 maybe


though.
 It's
 hard
 to
 tell.


>> It's
 hard
 to
 tell.


>> But
 I
 think
 even
 if
 we're
 not
 there
 yet,


we
 are
 getting
 maybe
 to
 that
 point
 where


like
 the
 rubber
 needs
 to
 meet
 the
 road


in
 terms
 of
 monetization.
 Like
 you
 know,


everyone
 got
 maybe.
 Okay.


>> Right.
 Maybe.


>> Yeah,
 you're
 right.
 Maybe


>> yesterday
 uh
 or
 uh
 either
 this
 morning


or
 yesterday
 uh
 anthropic
 $183
 billion


valuation.
 This
 does
 not
 strike
 me
 as


like


>> people
 worried
 about
 monetization.


people
 well
 or
 suddenly
 people
 are


worried
 about
 valuation.
 It
 sounds
 like


people
 really
 want
 to
 pour
 a
 lot
 of


money
 into
 these
 companies.


>> Yeah,
 it
 is.
 It's
 a
 weird
 environment.


Let's
 just
 put
 it
 that
 way.
 That's
 the


only
 thing
 we
 can
 say
 with
 certainty


that
 doesn't
 start
 with
 a
 maybe.


>> That's
 right.
 Um
 here's
 another
 thing
 we


can
 say
 with
 certainty.
 Alphabet
 the


shares
 are
 up
 as
 we're
 speaking
 8


something%
 today.
 This
 was
 a
 company


people
 were
 sort
 of
 worried
 about
 how


they
 would
 do
 in
 the
 AI
 era.
 They're


killing
 it.
 They're
 at
 an
 all-time
 high


again
 today.
 So
 again,
 like
 many
 things


are
 like
 it's
 tough
 to
 get
 a
 read
 on


things.


>> It
 is
 indeed.
 Who
 do
 we
 turn
 to?


>> I
 love
 this
 vague
 intro.
 We're
 like
 we


just
 want
 to
 get
 have
 an
 excuse
 to
 get


to
 the
 guest
 and
 so
 we're
 going
 to
 vamp


for
 a
 little
 while
 and
 then
 we're
 going


to
 get
 to
 the
 guest.


>> I
 I
 just
 tried
 to
 throw
 to
 the
 guest.


Joe,
 who
 do
 we
 turn
 to
 for
 a
 read
 on
 the


the
 true
 feelings
 of
 the
 market
 around


AI?


>> That's
 right.
 Uh
 we
 do
 have
 the
 perfect


guest.
 We're
 going
 to
 be
 speaking
 with


Josh
 Wolf.
 He's
 the
 co-founder,
 managing


partner
 at
 Lux
 Capital,
 VC
 who's
 been
 in


this
 space
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 A
 guy
 we


like
 to
 turn
 to
 to
 uh
 figure
 out
 what's


actually
 happening
 at
 any
 given
 moment.


He
 sometimes
 even
 has
 good
 interest
 uh


insights
 in
 public
 companies,
 too,
 not


just
 a
 private
 company.
 Uh
 Josh,
 thank


you
 so
 much
 for
 coming
 back
 on
 the


podcast.


>> Great
 to
 see
 you
 both.
 How
 you
 guys


doing?


>> Uh
 we're
 doing
 great.
 What's
 up
 with


Alphabet?
 Some
 people
 thought
 they
 were


going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 loser
 in
 AI
 because


they
 have
 this
 legacy
 search
 business


model
 and
 03
 is
 so
 much
 better
 for


searching
 things.
 Here
 they
 are
 surging.


They're
 at
 an
 all-time
 high.
 What
 is
 the


uh
 what
 is
 the
 smart
 take
 on
 Alphabet


right
 now?


>> I
 think
 they
 are
 crushing
 it.
 I
 think


they
 are
 the
 sort
 of
 dark
 horse
 underdog


and
 maybe
 the
 second
 that
 I
 would
 put


with
 that
 is
 Apple
 which
 people
 are


totally.


>> Yeah,
 totally.
 And
 you
 know
 the
 irony
 is


um
 you
 know
 if
 you
 think
 about
 the
 big


players
 Meta
 with
 Zuck's
 crazy
 poacha


Palooa
 you
 know
 the
 month


>> where
 uh
 you
 know
 hund00
 million
 pay


packages
 and
 trying
 to
 disrupt
 everybody


and
 bring
 them
 all
 on
 you're
 seeing


talks
 about
 them
 they've
 got
 midjourney


coming
 in
 for
 the
 images
 so
 not
 relying


on
 their
 own
 models
 they're
 talking


about
 oh
 yeah
 you
 know
 Google
 for
 uh
 you


know
 potential
 integration
 uh
 on
 on


search
 and
 uh
 so
 so
 it's
 interesting


that
 meta
 having
 committed
 to
 first
 be,


you
 know,
 the
 metaverse
 and
 change
 the


name
 to
 Meta
 and
 then
 Zuck
 going
 all
 in


AI
 is
 actually
 going
 to
 be
 turning
 to


some
 of
 these
 other
 players
 potentially.


Uh
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 surprise
 number
 one


that
 people
 thought
 that
 Meta
 was
 going


to
 be
 in
 the
 lead
 and
 um
 I
 think
 that
 uh


Google
 and
 Apple
 were
 both
 sort
 of


counted
 out,
 but
 both
 are
 very
 serious


contenders.
 If
 uh
 you
 look
 at
 the
 top


two
 video
 models
 that
 are
 out
 in
 the


world
 today,
 uh
 one
 US
 company
 which
 is


ours
 called
 Runway
 ML
 and
 the
 other


which
 is
 Veo
 3
 which
 is
 absolutely


stunning
 and
 incredible.
 um
 they
 are
 a


force
 to
 reckon
 with.
 It
 is


extraordinary
 development.
 You
 can
 make


an
 argument
 by
 the
 way
 they
 have
 this


repository
 exclusive
 to
 them
 of
 being


able
 to
 trade
 on
 every
 YouTube
 video


ever
 produced.
 That
 itself


>> is
 a
 super
 valuable
 piece.
 Um
 remember


it
 was
 what
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 ago,
 two


years
 ago
 that
 people
 were
 mocking
 Bard.


Bard
 was
 the
 laughing
 stock
 of
 all
 of


this.
 Gemini
 25
 is
 crushing
 it.
 Oh
 yeah.


you
 know,
 the
 the
 nano
 banana
 that
 uh
 I


don't
 know
 if
 you
 guys
 have
 used,
 which


was
 the
 the
 uh
 secret
 code
 name
 for


their
 latest
 image
 generation
 model
 is


probably
 the
 number
 one
 performing
 model


out
 there
 and
 paired
 with
 some
 of
 these


workflows
 that
 go
 into
 runway
 or
 even


into
 uh
 combined
 with
 midourney.
 So,
 I


think
 people
 counted
 Google
 out
 because


they
 were
 behind
 and
 they
 weren't
 part


of
 the
 hype,
 open
 AAI
 had
 won
 the


consumer
 both
 on
 subscription
 basis
 and


capturing
 people's
 habitual
 daily
 use


and
 that
 all
 made
 sense.
 Claude
 was


capturing
 it
 and
 anthropic
 on
 uh
 code
 uh


and
 then
 you've
 got
 niche
 players
 you


know
 like
 open
 evidence
 and
 other
 people


that
 are
 doing
 it
 in
 different
 verticals


like
 medicine
 but
 I
 think
 that
 the


corporate
 workflows
 I
 think
 about
 how


much
 Lux
 depends
 upon
 Gmail
 and
 Google


calendar
 and
 slides
 and
 their
 ability
 to


integrate
 that
 all
 over
 time
 is
 I
 think


going
 to
 give
 them
 a
 huge
 advantage.
 So


very
 bullish
 on
 Google.
 And
 by
 the
 way,


remember,
 go
 back
 20
 years
 or
 15
 years.


Google
 did
 the
 thing
 that
 completely
 did


what
 the
 DOJ
 couldn't
 do
 to
 Microsoft.


They
 dropped
 the
 price
 of
 alternatives


to
 the
 office
 suite
 to
 free


>> and
 the
 net
 result
 of
 that
 was
 Google,


which
 had
 this
 advertising
 model,
 was


ascended
 and
 Microsoft
 was
 suddenly


scrambling.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 the
 same


thing's
 going
 to
 happen.
 I
 think
 that
 a


lot
 of
 people
 funding
 foundation
 models


and
 the
 endless
 perception
 of
 endless


demand
 for
 GPUs
 and
 compute
 and
 all


these
 uh
 independent
 private
 AI


companies
 are
 going
 to
 be
 shocked
 by


what
 Google
 does
 on
 a
 pricing
 basis
 with


Gemini
 and
 beyond.


>> So
 Darkhorse
 uh
 I'd
 be
 pretty
 bullish.


>> Joe,
 did
 you
 immediately
 run
 to
 the
 Nano


Banana
 website?


>> Yeah,
 I
 did.
 As
 soon
 as
 you
 said
 I
 had


not
 used
 it.
 I'm
 not
 a
 I
 had
 never
 used


Nano
 Banana.
 That
 is
 the
 first
 place.


Don't
 don't
 go
 to
 a
 website
 called


nanobanana
 because
 you
 know
 you're
 going


to
 uh
 I
 don't
 know


>> nanobanana.ai
 looks
 like
 the
 right
 spot.


Okay.


>> Where
 you
 want
 to
 actually
 go
 is
 it's


now
 embedded
 inside
 of
 Google


>> the
 AI
 studio.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 see
 that.


Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Ability
 to
 take
 you
 and
 uh
 it's
 almost


like
 Photoshop.


>> So
 this
 is
 a
 threat
 to
 Tracy's
 MS
 Paint


skills
 which
 are
 legendary
 within
 the


OddLocks
 office.
 And
 maybe
 I
 will
 no


longer
 need
 to
 say,
 "Tracy,
 can
 you
 make


this
 for
 me
 in
 MS
 MS
 Paint?"


>> No.
 No
 technology
 will
 ever
 replace
 MS


Paint.
 I'm
 100%
 confident
 in
 that.
 I'm


being
 sarcastic,
 obviously.
 Okay.
 Um


Josh,
 can
 you
 talk
 more
 generally
 about


how
 people
 are
 feeling
 about
 the
 AI


space
 at
 the
 moment
 because
 you
 probably


heard
 us
 in
 the
 intro
 struggling
 to


characterize
 like
 the
 general
 attitudes


towards
 the
 sector
 at
 the
 moment.
 What's


your
 take
 on
 it?
 Well,
 the
 first
 is
 um


on
 the
 one
 hand,
 people
 underappreciate


how
 much
 this
 is
 going
 to
 change


everything
 in
 our
 daily
 lives.
 Um
 but


that
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 people
 are
 going


to
 make
 money
 from
 that.
 We're
 all
 going


to
 benefit.
 We'll
 all
 be
 more


productive.
 Um
 the
 great
 irony
 at
 the


macro
 scale,
 of
 course,
 is
 that
 people


thought
 that
 blue
 collar
 jobs
 were


totally
 screwed,


>> you
 know,
 and
 white
 collar
 jobs
 and
 the


Peter
 Ducker
 knowledge
 worker,


everybody's
 safe.
 But
 the
 great
 irony
 is


it
 is
 the
 knowledge
 workers
 that
 are
 in


trouble
 because
 so
 much
 of
 their


workflows
 are
 being
 captured
 and
 in
 a


sense
 commoditized
 and
 maybe
 approaching


an
 asmtote
 of
 good
 enough.
 It
 may
 not
 be


perfect
 but
 pretty
 damn
 good.
 And
 so


you're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 labor


destruction
 in
 segments
 and
 markets
 that


people
 were
 not
 anticipating.
 The
 first


early
 canary
 in
 the
 coal
 mine
 that


you're
 seeing
 there
 is
 hiring
 for


undergrads
 coming
 into
 entry-
 level


jobs.
 And
 whether
 that's
 investment


banking
 or
 sales
 and
 trading
 or


consulting
 or
 accounting,
 suddenly
 uh
 it


isn't
 that
 the
 economy
 is
 really


troubled.
 It's
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 those


demands
 you're
 seeing
 Salesforce
 say
 45%


of
 our
 jobs,
 you
 know,
 cut.
 Mark
 Benoff


is
 using
 AI
 instead
 of
 people.
 And


that's
 going
 to
 keep
 trickling
 down.


It's
 going
 to
 happen
 slowly
 and
 then


sort
 of
 all
 at
 once.
 So
 that's
 one
 thing


on
 the
 labor
 side
 and
 I
 would
 say


broadly
 that
 it's
 underhyped
 in
 how
 much


it's
 going
 to
 impact
 our
 lives.
 It's


overhyped
 in
 valuations.
 Now
 where
 is
 it


overhyped
 in
 valuations?
 First
 one,
 you


know,
 I
 was
 very
 proud
 10
 years
 ago.
 We


funded
 a
 company
 called
 Zuk.
 Zuks
 did


autonomous
 driving
 and
 they
 were


training
 these
 cars
 and
 we
 had
 $25


million
 in
 and
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "They're


playing
 video
 games.
 You
 know,
 what
 are


you
 doing?
 You're
 messing
 around."
 And


they
 said, "No,
 no,
 no.
 We're
 training


the
 vehicles
 and
 we
 have
 these
 Nvidia


chips.
 Nobody
 else
 has
 yet."
 That
 was


2015.
 I
 ended
 up
 pitching
 at
 a
 public


charity
 event,
 the
 Invest
 for
 Kids


conference,
 2015,
 2016.
 And
 this
 was
 a


$15
 billion
 market
 cap
 company
 at
 the


time
 when
 Intel
 was
 150
 billion.
 I
 said,


"This
 is
 like
 the
 pear
 trade
 of
 a


centric,
 you
 Oh,
 Nvidia,
 they're
 up
 like


340x
 since
 then,
 aren't
 they?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 and
 so
 this
 was
 just,


you
 know,
 insane.


>> It's
 the
 benefit
 of
 being
 a
 venture


capitalist
 that
 you
 get
 to
 see
 the


future
 in
 legal
 inside
 information


inside
 the
 companies
 and
 what
 people
 are


doing.


>> Uh
 so
 the
 perception
 and
 the
 consensus


in
 AI
 on
 the
 hardware
 stack
 is
 that
 we


need
 endless
 demand
 for
 data
 centers.
 We


need
 endless
 demand
 for
 GPUs.
 We
 need


100,000
 clusters
 of
 H100
 chips
 or


Blackwell
 chips.
 uh
 we're
 gonna
 thwart


China
 from
 getting
 the
 chips,
 but


they're
 going
 to
 sort
 of
 design
 around


or
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 different


versions
 of
 the
 Nvidia
 chips
 for
 China.


Um
 I
 think
 that
 this
 is
 misplaced.
 And


I'll
 give
 you
 another
 insight.
 Uh
 you


know,
 we
 may
 have
 talked
 a
 little
 bit


about
 this
 in
 the
 past,
 but
 there
 was
 a


paper
 from
 Apple


>> a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 ago


>> that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 not
 really
 uh


sucked
 their
 teeth
 into,
 which
 was
 um


>> the
 idea
 that
 you
 could
 do
 large


language
 models
 on
 device
 using
 flash


memory,
 not
 you
 needing
 GPUs.
 And
 so


Jensen
 and
 Nvidia
 will
 tell
 you
 you
 need


all
 of
 these
 H100
 chips
 and
 you
 need


endless
 compute
 and
 lots
 of
 data
 centers


for
 training
 and
 that's
 generally
 true


but
 the
 other
 part
 of
 it
 the
 fancy
 word


for
 prompting
 which
 we
 call
 inference
 uh


you
 don't
 necessarily
 need
 that
 and
 if


that
 is
 true
 then
 that
 means
 that
 our


devices
 maybe
 are
 uh
 running
 on
 SKH
 and


Micron
 and
 Samsung
 and
 the
 memory


players
 which
 have
 just
 like
 the
 GPU


players
 were
 considered
 commodity


players
 with
 the
 upgrade
 cycle
 of
 the


gaming
 consoles
 for
 PS5
 an
 Xbox.
 I
 think


you
 may
 see
 a
 shift
 towards
 edge


inference.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 I've
 been


talking
 about
 this
 for
 about
 a
 year
 and


a
 half.
 Elon
 just
 tweeted
 out
 about
 it


maybe
 two,
 three
 weeks
 ago
 saying
 like


this
 is
 an
 inevitability,
 but
 I
 think


it's
 going
 to
 shift
 away
 this
 fallacy
 of


composition
 where
 what
 Google
 is
 doing


and
 Anthropic
 is
 doing
 and
 OpenAI
 is


doing
 and
 Meta
 is
 doing
 at
 a
 huge
 scale


all
 to
 the
 benefit
 of
 Jensen
 and
 Nvidia


and
 Nvidia
 shareholders
 may
 start
 to


chip
 away
 and
 say,
 "Wait
 a
 second,
 we


don't
 need
 all
 this
 compute.
 There's


going to
 be
 a
 glut."
 So
 that's
 the
 first


one
 on
 the
 hardware.


>> That's
 very
 interesting.
 And
 um
 yeah,


I'd
 heard
 I
 haven't
 done
 much
 with
 on


device
 things.
 A
 friend
 of
 mine
 was


telling
 me
 that
 um
 Alibaba's
 model
 Quinn


works
 very
 well
 on
 a
 phone
 for
 example.


So
 maybe
 something
 we
 should
 pay
 more


attention
 to.
 All right.
 As
 a
 VC,


when
 you
 are
 uh
 doing
 due
 diligence
 on
 a


company,
 how
 does
 it
 affect
 how
 you


think
 about
 even
 arriving
 at
 the
 concept


of
 fair
 value
 when
 there
 is
 the
 prospect


that
 some
 share
 of
 the
 enterprise
 value


of
 the
 company
 could
 walk
 out
 the
 door


via
 aqua
 hire
 to
 a
 meta
 etc.
 Now
 I
 get


it
 different
 not
 every
 company
 in
 AI
 is


doing
 the
 hard
 science
 etc.
 But
 just


coming
 from
 your
 perspective
 as
 an


investor,
 how
 is
 that
 changing
 how
 you


think
 of
 companies
 that
 so
 much
 of
 where


the
 value
 is
 may
 lie
 with
 talent
 that


could
 just
 walk
 out
 the
 door
 at
 any


time?


>> It
 it
 is
 a
 very
 big
 deal.
 The
 entire


social
 contract
 of
 venture
 capital
 is


the
 premise
 that
 pension
 funds
 and
 high


net
 worth
 individuals
 and
 endowments,


give
 capital
 to
 people
 like
 us.
 We
 then


go
 deploy
 it
 into
 companies.
 We
 buy


stakes.
 We
 try
 to
 buy
 them
 as
 early
 as


we
 can
 and
 own
 as
 much
 of
 a
 company
 and


be
 a
 partner
 and
 add
 value
 and
 then
 sell


those
 companies.
 But
 if
 all
 of a
 sudden


somebody
 is
 being
 pried
 away
 and
 the


irony
 of
 all
 of
 this
 is
 that
 because
 of


a
 very
 uh
 suppressive
 DOJ
 and
 FTC
 that


basically
 said
 no
 no
 M&A
 we're
 coming


after
 you
 you
 know
 big
 tech
 companies
 uh


we
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 more
 consolidation


you
 have
 too
 much
 power
 so
 they
 started


doing
 instead
 of
 M&A
 LNA
 instead
 of


mergers
 and
 acquisitions
 they
 were
 doing


license
 and
 aqua
 hire
 and
 what
 that


meant
 was
 hey
 we'll
 buy
 and
 they
 did


this
 with
 scale
 we'll
 buy
 49%
 of
 your


company.
 I
 think
 scale
 was
 valued
 at


around
 $12
 billion
 thereabout
 and
 they


said
 well
 we'll
 pay
 14
 slight
 premium
 to


your
 last
 round
 but
 we'll
 buy
 49%


effectively
 valuing
 it
 at
 28
 billion
 uh


but
 we'll
 pay
 out
 that
 money
 to
 the


company.
 You
 can
 dividend
 it
 out
 to


shareholders.
 So
 it
 may
 not
 be
 perfectly


tax
 efficient
 number
 one
 but
 um
 then


we're
 going
 to
 basically
 license
 the


technology
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 take
 all


the
 people
 or
 at least
 the
 top
 people.


The
 result
 of
 that
 is
 you're
 navigating


around
 Delaware
 governance.
 It's
 really


important
 because
 you
 know
 it's
 sort
 of


like
 Carl
 Icon
 used
 to
 say
 your
 price
 my


terms.


>> You
 know
 there's
 this
 phenomenon
 in


legal
 terms
 people
 might
 call
 the


Chesterton
 fence.
 The
 idea
 of
 the


Chesterton
 fence
 is
 thought
 experiment


of
 like
 okay
 there's
 a
 fence
 there.
 What


the
 heck
 is
 it
 there
 for?
 You
 don't


understand
 right?
 Well
 maybe
 it
 was


there
 to
 keep
 the
 sheep
 in
 or
 keep
 the


wolves
 out
 or
 whatever
 it
 is.
 every


legal
 term
 in
 every
 term
 sheet
 that
 a


venture
 capitalist
 gives
 or
 a
 founder


gets
 is
 based
 on
 somebody
 screwing


somebody
 in
 the
 past
 and
 they're
 like,


"Uh-uh,
 we're
 not
 letting
 that
 happen


again."
 So,
 I
 can
 guarantee
 you
 that
 the


next
 few
 years,
 you
 will
 see
 all
 kind
 of


protective
 provisions
 and
 covenants
 that


say
 if
 one
 of
 these
 companies
 comes
 and


tries
 to
 just
 acquire
 you,
 all
 of
 your


stock,
 you
 know,
 reverts
 and
 yada
 yada.


Um
 and
 and
 so
 there's
 going
 to
 be


tie-ups
 and
 holdbacks
 that
 are
 a


pendulum
 swing
 away
 from
 the
 super


founder
 friendly
 dynamics
 where
 venture


capitalists
 were
 tripping
 over


themselves
 to
 basically
 give
 the
 most


founder
 friendly
 terms
 that
 they
 can


because
 the
 founder
 would
 say
 well
 if


you
 don't
 give
 me
 what
 I
 want
 I'll
 go
 to


somebody
 else.
 But
 I
 think that
 the


pendulum
 is
 swinging
 with
 the
 cost
 of


capital
 rising
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 see


more
 and
 more
 investorfriendly
 term


sheets
 partially
 as
 a
 reaction
 to
 the


fact
 that
 somebody
 like
 Zuck
 and
 Meta


can
 go
 in
 and
 just
 basically
 take
 the


fruit
 off
 the
 end
 of
 the
 tree
 and
 leave


a
 stump.


>> By
 the
 way,
 Tracy,
 as
 we
 were
 talking


about
 this
 breaking
 from
 the
 Wall
 Street


Journal,
 XAI
 CFO
 Liberator
 never
 stepped


down.
 Latest
 in
 string
 of
 executive


departures
 always
 moves
 in
 this
 space.


>> Yes,
 indeed.
 um
 you
 know
 the
 sort
 of


race
 to
 the
 bottom
 in
 terms
 of
 terms
 it


reminds
 me
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 corporate
 bond


market
 and
 the
 rise
 of
 covenant
 light


deals
 right
 and
 I
 remember
 a
 time
 when


like
 covite
 deals
 were
 a
 minority
 in
 the


uh
 leverage
 loan
 market
 and
 now
 I
 think


they're
 like


>> almost
 98%
 or
 99%
 basically
 everything's


covite
 now
 because
 the
 issuers
 had
 all


the
 power
 recently
 and
 they
 were
 able
 to


push
 back
 against
 investors.
 Um,
 you


mentioned
 the
 higher
 cost
 of
 capital


there,
 like
 how
 much
 leverage
 does
 that


actually
 give
 you
 as
 a
 VC?
 And
 then


secondly,
 just
 going
 back
 to
 the
 aqua


hire
 thing,
 how
 reliable
 can
 legal


restrictions
 actually
 be
 in
 terms
 of


preventing
 like
 your
 star
 engineers
 from


leaving
 the
 company?
 Are
 they
 ever
 going


to
 be
 like
 100%
 bulletproof?


>> No.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 you
 have
 non-competes


that
 are
 not
 enforceable
 in
 California,


a
 little
 bit
 more
 enforceable
 in
 New


York.
 you
 have
 arbitrage
 and


jurisdictional
 stuff.
 Um,
 broadly
 I


would
 say
 that
 the
 lower
 the
 cost
 of
 the


capital,
 the
 shorter
 your
 term
 sheets


are.
 The
 higher
 the
 cost
 of
 the
 capital,


the
 longer
 your
 term
 sheets
 are.
 Uh,
 you


got
 more
 terms,
 more
 covenants,
 more


protections
 because
 you
 can
 afford
 to
 be


able
 to
 negotiate
 for
 those
 things.
 And


it's
 not
 because
 you're
 trying
 to
 screw


over
 the
 founder.
 What
 you're
 really


trying
 to
 do
 as
 an
 investor
 is
 prevent


yourself
 from
 being
 screwed
 over.
 But


again,
 there's
 always
 a
 pendulum


swinging
 here
 back
 and
 forth.
 Even
 if


you
 think
 about
 Zuck
 and
 Meta
 and
 this


entire
 movement
 of,
 hey,
 I'm
 the


founder.
 I'm
 going
 to
 have
 super
 voting


stock
 of
 10
 or
 100
 to
 one
 uh
 and
 control


was
 in
 a
 response
 to
 founders
 being


ousted,
 you
 know,
 by
 bad
 investors
 or


bad
 board
 members
 and
 some
 of
 the
 best


companies,
 frankly,
 being
 run
 by


founders.
 And
 so
 there's
 always
 going
 to


be
 this
 pendulum
 shift.
 To
 your
 direct


question,
 um
 it's
 really
 a
 covenant
 and


contract
 that
 starts
 socially
 before
 it


starts
 legally.


>> If
 I'm
 backing
 a
 founder,
 I'm
 doing
 the


most
 important
 thing
 in
 addition
 to


writing
 a
 check.
 I
 believe
 before
 others


understand,
 particularly
 at
 the
 early


stage,
 I'm
 encouraging
 them
 to
 start


their
 company.
 I'm
 giving
 them
 the


confidence
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 back
 them


and
 believe
 in
 them.
 We're
 going to
 give


them
 the
 capital
 so
 they
 can
 go
 hire
 the


10
 best
 people
 to
 start
 the
 business.


We're
 going
 to
 give
 them
 the
 money
 for


the
 compute
 or
 the
 infrastructure.


Depending
 on
 the
 sector
 that
 we're
 in,


it
 could
 be
 biotech,
 could
 be
 defense,


but
 whatever
 it
 is
 in
 this
 particular


moment,
 it
 is
 breaking
 the
 social


contract
 between
 investors
 and
 founders.


And
 for
 founders,
 it
 might
 be
 heads
 I


win
 and
 tails
 I
 also
 win.
 And
 so
 that's


the
 dynamic
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 a


reaction
 of
 investors
 saying,
 "Wait
 a


second,


>> I'm
 getting
 screwed.
 My
 limited
 partners


are
 getting
 screwed."
 Again,
 those


limited
 partners
 are
 endowments
 and


foundations
 and
 and
 wealthy
 families.


And
 you
 got
 to
 protect
 against
 a


potential
 bad
 actor
 trying
 to
 take
 the


fruit
 off
 the
 edge
 of
 the
 tree
 and
 just


leave
 you
 with
 a
 stump.
 So,
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 comes
 up
 a
 lot
 on
 the


podcast
 and
 this
 discovery
 over
 years
 of


conversations
 and
 what
 you're
 describing


it's
 principal
 agent
 problems
 all
 the


way
 down
 in
 finance
 and
 this
 is
 why
 we


see
 the
 rise
 of
 the
 multistrap
 model
 in


hedge
 funds
 in
 some
 ways
 to
 align
 the


incentives
 PM
 with
 the
 level
 of
 the


overall
 fund
 with
 the
 level
 of
 the


endowment
 etc.
 And
 of
 course,
 some
 of


these
 issues
 that
 you're
 wrestling
 with


or
 where
 everyone's
 wrestling
 with
 in


finance,
 similar
 issues
 about
 where
 the


incentives
 align
 between
 the
 star


engineer,
 the
 founder,
 the
 VC,
 the
 LP,


and
 so
 forth.
 I
 have
 a
 question
 though,


a
 venture
 capital
 firm.
 The
 goal
 in


theory
 is
 to
 create
 funds
 with
 the


highest
 return,
 right?
 Make
 money
 for


investors.
 But
 I
 could
 also
 imagine
 a


slightly
 different
 um
 uh
 incentive
 in


which
 if
 the
 goal
 is
 to
 collect
 LP


money,
 then
 maybe
 you
 want
 to
 show
 that


you're
 in
 the
 hottest
 deals
 of
 the
 time


so
 that
 when
 you
 go
 to
 various


endowments
 and
 pensions
 and
 so
 forth,


you
 we're
 in
 this
 deal,
 we're
 in
 this


deal,
 we're
 in
 this
 deal.
 And
 maybe
 that


overrides
 the
 impulse
 to
 create
 high


returns.
 By
 the
 way,
 I'm
 not
 insinuating


anything.
 I'm
 just
 trying
 to
 get
 your


perspective
 on
 something.
 That
 being


said,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 you
 hear


that's
 happening
 in
 tech
 these
 days
 is


that
 and
 for
 years
 founders
 taking
 money


off
 the
 table
 earlier
 and
 earlier
 in
 the


process.
 You
 invest
 $50
 million
 in
 a


company,
 20
 million
 is
 so
 that
 the


founder
 can
 retire
 for
 him,
 his


children,
 and
 and
 his
 children.
 That
 may


not
 be
 great
 for
 your
 LPs,
 but
 it
 might


be
 good
 for
 you
 if
 you
 could
 say
 we
 got


in
 this
 deal.
 Talk
 to
 us
 about
 how


prevalent
 this
 is
 and
 how
 this
 is


changing
 this
 sort
 of
 a
 social
 contract


of
 finance.
 So,
 there's
 three
 layers
 of


incentives
 and
 and
 man,
 you
 really


nailed
 it.
 I
 I
 actually
 haven't
 really


heard
 somebody
 uh
 that
 is
 not
 a


full-time
 venture
 capitalist
 or
 limited


partner
 nail
 these
 these
 issues.
 So,
 so


very
 pressing
 and
 very
 shrewd.
 Um
 here's


the
 three
 layers.
 First,
 think
 about
 the


LPs.
 You're
 an
 endowment
 or
 you're
 a


foundation
 or
 you're
 a
 hospital.
 You're


giving
 5%
 by
 law
 of
 your
 uh
 uh


charitable
 assets
 every
 year.
 you
 want


to
 continue
 to
 earn
 more
 than
 5%
 so
 that


you
 can
 grow
 that
 base
 and
 invest
 in


campuses
 and
 scholarships
 or
 expand


hospital
 systems
 and
 whatnot.
 So
 you


invest,
 you
 know,
 6040
 bonds
 uh
 equity.


Uh
 now
 you
 do
 the
 Swenson
 model
 from


Yale
 and
 you
 start
 introducing
 some


private
 equity.
 Uh
 and
 now
 you're


extending
 your
 duration
 and
 you're


extending
 your
 liquidity,
 but
 you're


doing
 it
 because
 you
 think
 you're


getting
 better
 returns.
 Okay,
 returns


are
 a
 function
 of
 how
 much
 capital
 is


going
 into
 a
 sector.
 If
 there's
 a
 ton
 of


capital
 going
 into
 a
 sector,
 if
 you're


early,
 you're
 going to
 do
 really
 well.


If
 you're
 late,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 doing


really
 poor
 because
 as
 Buffett
 says,
 you


pay
 a
 high
 price
 for
 a
 cheery
 consensus


and
 once
 it's
 consensus,
 you're
 not


making
 money.
 So
 the
 LP's
 incentive
 is


to
 make
 as
 much
 money
 they
 can
 for
 their


benefactors,
 whether
 they're
 patients
 or


scholars
 or
 charitable
 giving.
 The
 VC's


incentive
 is
 two
 things.
 One,
 get
 the


best
 return
 so
 that
 you
 can
 compete.
 If


I'm
 only
 earning
 12%
 and
 a
 peer
 VC
 is


earning
 20%,
 money
 is
 going
 to
 go
 where


it's
 going
 to
 be
 well
 treated
 and
 uh
 I'm


going
 to
 lose
 to
 that.
 So
 the
 cost
 of
 my


capital
 for
 the
 cost
 of
 an
 LP's
 capital


is
 outperformance.
 So
 I've
 got
 to


outperform,
 which
 means
 I
 have
 to
 be


earlier.
 I
 have
 to
 own
 more.
 I
 can't


just
 do
 stupid
 deals.
 Sophisticated
 LPs


will
 not
 just
 look
 at
 the
 logos
 that
 you


have,
 which
 is
 the
 game
 that
 you
 always


>> sophisticated
 LPS


>> from
 mutual
 funds
 and
 from
 some
 hedge


funds.
 You
 know,
 you'd
 see
 the
 Q4


filings
 and
 they
 always
 threw
 in
 the


name,
 oh,
 we
 were
 in
 Nvidia,
 you
 know,


and
 they
 would
 market
 their
 top
 10


holdings,
 but
 BS,
 you
 know,
 they
 lost


money
 on
 it,
 right?
 And
 so,
 so
 that
 is
 a


really
 important
 incentive
 and
 the


sophisticated
 LPs
 will
 actually
 know


down
 to
 the
 partner
 at
 the
 firm
 or
 the


team
 or
 the
 deal
 team
 who
 was


responsible
 for
 this,
 what
 was
 the
 entry


point.
 They
 will
 talk
 to
 the
 founders


and
 say
 who
 was
 your
 most
 valuable


investor,
 who
 got
 you
 your
 first
 10


hires,
 who
 helped
 with
 your
 syndicate


construction
 for
 your
 later
 rounds,
 who


made
 customer
 introductions,
 who
 was
 a


valuable
 board
 member,
 who
 never
 showed


up,
 who
 was
 asleep
 in
 the
 board


meetings,
 all
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 So


there
 is
 a
 level
 of
 due
 diligence
 that


LPs
 have
 to
 do
 to
 know
 are
 you
 a
 value


ad
 investor
 or
 are
 you
 a
 poser
 or


pretender
 that's
 just
 buying
 a
 logo
 or
 a


brand
 name.
 Okay.
 The
 other
 incentive


and
 then
 we'll
 get
 to
 the
 founders


liquidity
 is
 you
 have
 this
 weird
 dynamic


of
 what
 I've
 called
 the
 minnows
 and
 the


megas
 in
 venture
 capital.
 This
 is
 in


preview
 a
 shakeout
 that
 is
 going
 to


happen.
 Uh
 the
 minnows
 are
 the
 thousands


of
 small
 sub500
 million
 dollar
 funds


that
 proliferated
 when
 the
 cost
 of


capital
 was
 low,
 rates
 were
 low,


everybody
 was
 making
 money,
 you
 had
 a


roommate
 that
 started
 a
 company
 and
 you


got
 into
 Pinterest
 or
 you
 knew
 somebody


at
 Meta
 and
 they
 gave
 you
 a
 deal
 and


blah
 blah
 blah
 blah
 blah.
 And
 when
 you


had
 the
 tigers
 and
 the
 soft
 banks
 and


the
 abundance
 of
 follow-on
 capital,


every
 round
 was
 an
 up
 round.
 You
 had


paper
 marks
 that
 kept
 going
 up
 and
 up


and
 up
 and
 it
 looked
 great
 and
 you're


reporting
 these
 paper
 marks
 and
 then


sometimes
 these
 things
 became
 zeros.


Okay,
 but
 you
 raised
 your
 next
 fund


before
 they
 became
 a
 zero.
 Those
 are
 the


minnows.
 I
 was
 with
 one
 of
 my
 very
 large


LPs
 has
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 of
 dollars


invested
 with
 us
 and
 I
 said
 I
 think


there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 50%
 extinction


rate
 amongst
 these
 minnows
 and
 he
 said


Josh
 that
 is
 ridiculous.
 It's
 going
 to


be
 90%.


So
 you
 are
 going
 to
 have
 a
 mass


extinction.
 Now
 why,
 by
 the
 way?
 Not


because
 they're
 just
 bad
 investors.
 It's


Shakespearean,
 okay?
 Shakespearean
 in


that
 these
 are
 partnerships.
 People


start
 to
 hate
 each
 other
 when
 it
 becomes


hard.
 People
 start
 to
 hate
 each
 other


when
 there's
 down
 rounds.
 People
 start


to
 hate
 each
 other
 when
 there
 somebody


else's
 deal
 is
 a
 crappy
 deal
 and
 they're


bringing
 down
 your
 carry.
 And
 so


partnerships
 are
 fragile
 things
 just


like
 relationships
 and
 marriages
 and
 and


and
 they
 can
 break
 up.
 And
 so
 you
 have
 a


lot
 of
 VCs
 started
 in
 the
 past
 few


years.
 They're
 not
 experienced
 in
 going


through
 cycles.
 They
 have
 inadequate


reserves
 to
 continue
 to
 fund
 their


companies.
 So
 you're
 going to
 have
 an


extinction
 that
 I
 would
 consider


involuntary
 exits.
 Okay.
 Then
 there's


voluntary
 exits
 which
 is
 another


interesting
 dynamic.
 And
 there's
 a


playbook
 for
 this
 which
 is
 2009
 to
 2014


all
 the
 big
 private
 equity
 firms
 reached


a
 level
 of
 scale
 several
 hundred
 billion


dollars
 aum
 assets
 under
 management


where
 they
 basically
 said
 we're


diversified
 where
 alternative
 asset


platforms
 Carlile
 Blackstone
 KKR
 TPG


Apollo
 all
 went
 public.
 The
 same
 thing


is
 going
 to
 happen
 in
 venture
 with


probably
 five
 or
 six
 firms.
 My


prediction
 is
 and
 they're
 all
 great


people
 running
 great
 firms
 but
 they're


starting
 to
 play
 a
 different
 game
 and


that
 game
 Andre
 Harowitz,
 General


Atlantic,
 General
 Catalyst,
 uh,
 Insight,


Lightseed,
 a
 handful
 of
 others
 all
 at
 80


or
 100
 billion
 AUM
 have
 built
 great


firms
 but
 are
 thinking
 about
 how
 do
 we


create
 generational
 wealth
 for
 the


founders
 and
 go
 public.
 Different


incentive.


>> Yeah.


>> How
 do
 I
 make
 my
 LPs
 the
 best
 money
 or


get
 the
 best
 founders?
 It's
 about
 asset


gathering
 and
 liquidity.
 Now,
 we
 go
 to


the
 founders.
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 I've
 been


on
 both
 sides
 of
 this.
 On
 the
 one
 hand,


you
 want
 to
 be
 fully
 aligned
 with
 your


founders.
 Meaning,
 I'm
 in
 a
 fund,
 it's


10
 years.
 Some
 VCs
 vest
 over
 two
 or


three
 or
 four
 years.
 We
 vest
 and
 all
 of


our
 partners
 vest
 over
 10
 years.
 The


same
 duration
 that
 you're
 if
 you're
 an


LP
 with
 me,
 your
 money
 is
 locked
 up.


It's
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 do.
 Buffett


style.
 And
 the
 guy
 that
 put
 me
 in


business,
 Bill
 Conway,
 who's
 the
 Carile


founder,
 this
 is
 what
 they
 did.
 So
 if


you're
 a
 entrepreneur
 and
 you
 start
 a


company
 and
 people
 are
 tripping
 over


themselves
 to
 get
 in,
 they
 might
 entice


you
 with
 green
 mail
 and
 say,
 "Yes,
 we're


going
 to
 invest
 just
 like
 you
 said,
 Joe,


$50
 million,
 but
 we're
 going
 to
 give
 you


20
 million
 of
 liquidity."
 Okay.
 Now,
 I


will
 say
 this,
 2019,
 I'm
 on
 a
 Zoom
 call


for
 an
 amazing
 company
 called
 Control


Labs
 that
 we
 sell
 for
 to
 Meta
 for
 a


little
 under
 a
 billion
 dollars.
 And
 I


love
 this
 company
 and
 I
 love
 the


founders.
 And
 I'm
 This
 is
 before


everybody
 was
 on
 Zoom
 during
 COVID.
 And


I'm
 looking
 at
 the
 Zoom
 window
 and
 I
 see


one
 of
 the
 founders
 and
 I
 text
 the
 other


founder
 because
 I
 think
 that
 they're


selling
 too
 early.
 And
 I'm
 the
 lone


board
 member
 that
 didn't
 have
 a
 veto,


but
 I'm
 like,
 I
 really
 think
 we
 should


stay
 the
 course
 and
 we
 should
 keep


going.
 And
 I
 made
 a
 terrible,
 terrible


mistake
 because
 I'm
 looking
 at
 the
 Zoom


window
 and
 I
 see
 the
 guy
 and
 I
 I
 look


closer
 and
 I
 and
 I
 text
 the
 other


founder
 and
 I'm
 like,
 "Is
 he
 still
 in
 a


dorm
 room?"
 And
 sure
 enough,
 he
 was
 in
 a


dorm
 room
 as
 a
 PhD,
 had
 made
 no
 money.


>> Yeah,
 you
 got
 to
 let
 that
 guy
 get
 rich.


>> Paper
 stock
 value.
 And
 he's
 like,
 "Yes,


I
 want
 to
 sell
 because
 he's
 going
 to


make
 90
 hundred
 million
 dollars
 and
 it's


life-changing
 money."
 And
 I
 sat
 there


and
 I
 said,
 "Ah,
 if
 I
 would
 have
 just


given
 him
 a
 few
 million
 dollars
 of


interest,


>> he
 would
 have
 been
 able


>> to
 take
 a
 breath,
 buy
 a
 house,
 you
 know,


get
 out
 of
 that


>> door


>> and
 and and
 keep
 going.


There
 is
 a
 virtue
 of
 giving
 some


liquidity,
 but
 you
 need
 to
 be
 aligned.


And
 in
 that
 moment,
 we
 were
 not
 aligned


because
 he
 was
 like,
 I'm
 calling
 in
 rich


>> and
 I
 wanted
 him
 to
 keep
 going.


>> But
 if
 you're
 calling
 in
 rich
 and
 you


you
 you
 you're
 not
 completing
 the
 the


job,
 the
 mission,
 then
 you
 have
 total


misalignment.
 So


>> that's
 the
 dynamics
 LP
 alignment,
 GP


alignment,
 and
 the
 bifurcation,
 and
 then


founder
 alignment.
 A
 little
 bit
 of


liquidity
 is
 okay
 to
 let
 them
 stay
 the


course.


>> Okay.
 Other
 than
 misalignment
 and


everyone
 starting
 to
 hate
 each
 other
 um


as
 the
 cost
 of
 capital
 goes
 up,
 there's


another
 thing
 going
 on
 which
 is
 uh
 you


know
 open
 AI
 just
 launched
 some
 open


source
 models
 of
 its
 own.
 And
 this
 leads


me
 to
 a
 question
 that
 like
 I'm
 going
 to


admit
 I
 I've
 never
 quite
 understood


this,
 but
 like
 what
 exactly
 is
 the


attraction
 for
 VC
 investors
 to
 open


source
 models
 as
 opposed
 to
 closed


source
 where
 like
 closed
 source,
 you


know,
 it's
 proprietary,
 people


presumably
 have
 to
 pay
 in
 order
 to
 get


it.
 There's
 like
 a
 defensible
 moat


around
 the
 business,
 you
 would
 assume.


Why
 in
 the
 world
 would
 I
 ever
 want
 to


fund
 a
 model
 that's
 open
 source?


>> Well,
 a
 few
 things.
 One,
 um,
 if
 you
 go


back
 in
 the
 compute
 stack,
 you
 had
 this


with
 like
 Red
 Hat
 and
 Linux,
 you
 know,


going
 back,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 15,
 20
 years


ago.
 Um,
 we
 are
 the
 largest
 owners
 of
 a


company
 called
 Hugging
 Face,
 which
 is


both
 the
 most
 ridiculous
 name.
 And
 when


one
 of
 my
 partners,
 Brandon
 Reeves,
 was


sourcing
 this
 deal,
 it
 was a
 bunch
 of


free
 French
 PhDs
 came
 to
 Brooklyn,
 uh,


and
 they're
 like,
 "We're
 starting
 this."


I'm
 like, "Hugging
 face."
 And
 they're


like, "Yeah,
 it's
 named
 after
 an
 emoji."


The
 little,
 you
 know,
 hugging
 face


emoji.
 cute.
 Um,
 they
 became
 the


leading.


>> I
 like
 that
 you're
 visually


demonstrating
 everything
 for
 us.
 Thank


you.


>> I
 can't
 do
 many
 other
 emojis
 and
 you


don't
 want
 to
 see
 some
 of
 them,
 but
 but


hugging
 face
 I
 can
 do.
 So,
 they
 became


the
 leading
 open-
 source
 repository.


Now,
 the
 great
 irony,
 by
 the
 way,
 is


when
 Open
 AI
 started,
 they
 were
 Open
 AI,


but
 they
 became
 the
 world's
 greatest


chatbot.
 Hugging
 Face
 started
 with
 a


really
 crappy
 chatbot,
 but
 then
 became


the
 world's
 greatest
 open-source


repository.
 every
 major
 uh
 tech
 company


including
 OpenAI,
 Microsoft,
 any
 open


source
 model
 that
 they
 do
 they
 put
 on


there
 and
 that
 is
 like
 the
 GitHub
 of
 AI


models.
 Microsoft
 bought
 GitHub
 roughly


8
 billion
 eight
 and
 a
 half
 billion


dollars.
 Uh
 it
 was
 a
 really
 valuable


store
 of
 models
 and
 and
 and
 code.
 This


is
 the
 same
 thing
 for
 dynamic
 AI
 models.


So
 as
 a
 VC
 we
 originally
 funded
 this
 I


want
 to
 say
 at
 a
 30
 or
 40
 million
 pre-


money
 valuation.
 last
 round
 was
 north
 of


$6
 billion
 dollars
 and
 real
 revenue


generating
 multi-hundreds
 of
 millions
 of


dollars.
 Uh
 serious
 company
 uh
 now
 the


trend
 is
 this.
 Uh
 Venode
 Kos
 and
 I
 were


both
 in
 the
 White
 House
 uh
 a
 year
 and
 a


half
 ago
 and
 we
 were
 having
 a
 debate


with
 Jake
 Sullivan
 about
 what
 is
 better


for
 national
 security


>> uh
 open
 source
 or
 closed
 and
 I
 said


where
 you
 stand
 on
 the
 issue
 depends
 on


where
 you
 sit
 in
 the
 cap
 table.
 Okay.


And
 venode
 was
 an
 early
 investor.
 Uh
 I


think
 he
 probably
 put
 50
 million
 into


open
 AAI.
 I
 think
 it
 became
 worth
 you


know
 a
 billion
 plus
 is
 a
 great


investment
 and
 he
 believed
 that
 the
 best


thing
 for
 us
 visav
 China
 and
 the
 Chinese


Communist
 Party
 was
 closed
 proprietary


siloed
 model
 and
 I
 had
 the
 counter
 view


because
 we're
 big
 investors
 in
 hugging


face
 with
 a
 very
 large
 position
 and
 I


said
 no
 because
 the
 great
 virtue
 of
 any


system
 be
 it
 journalism
 scientific


inquiry
 computer
 code
 is
 the
 ability
 to


have
 in
 this
 very
 Carl
 popper
 like
 way


if
 I
 can
 get
 philosophically
 geeky
 for
 a


second
 of
 conjecture,
 hypothesis
 and


criticism.
 That
 is
 what
 creates
 great


societies.
 It's
 what
 creates
 knowledge.


So
 you
 come
 up
 with
 hypothesis,
 you
 come


up
 with
 code,
 you
 come
 up
 with
 a


scientific
 experiment,
 you
 come
 up
 with


an
 investigative
 journalist
 idea
 and


then
 people
 get
 to
 criticize
 it.
 It's


your
 editorial
 room,
 it's
 people


fighting
 it
 out
 and
 things
 improve


through
 that
 mechanism.
 So
 you
 think


about
 China,
 they
 will
 only
 uh
 approach


an
 asmtote
 of
 truth.
 You
 will
 never
 get,


you
 know,
 Shin
 Jang,
 you'll
 never
 get


Tanaman
 Square,
 you'll
 never
 get
 the


Weaguers.
 uh
 whereas
 open
 source
 lets


you
 approach
 closer
 in
 asmtote
 of
 truth.


So
 that's
 the
 virtue
 of
 open
 source.
 The


real
 thing
 though
 for
 AI
 is
 this.
 I
 am


not
 convinced
 that
 the
 value
 will


continue
 to
 acrue
 to
 in
 terms
 of


enterprise
 value
 the
 closed
 foundation


models.
 And
 the
 reason
 is
 open
 source
 is


getting
 near
 damn
 performative
 enough.


Yeah.
 That
 the
 real
 value
 will
 go
 to
 the


longitudinal
 repositories
 of
 siloed


information.
 That
 is
 a
 mouthful
 of


basically
 saying
 your
 database
 of


proprietary
 data.
 Bloomberg
 has
 it
 with


a
 huge
 and
 wonderful
 repository
 of


financial
 information,
 time
 series,


every
 security,
 currency,
 bond,
 fixed


income,
 etc.
 QIP
 that
 you
 can
 imagine.


Uh
 Meta
 has
 it
 with
 all
 of
 your
 WhatsApp


chats
 and
 your
 uh
 Instagram
 posts
 and


your
 Facebook
 likes.
 Meta
 um
 uh
 X
 and


Twitter
 have
 it
 with
 all
 of
 your
 tweets.


So
 uh
 pharma
 companies
 with
 your


clinical
 data
 anybody
 that
 has
 siloed


proprietary
 and
 long
 time
 time
 frame
 um


data
 is
 going
 to
 benefit
 from
 open


source
 models
 that
 over
 time
 become


commodity
 and
 then
 your
 business
 model


is
 how
 do
 you
 charge
 people
 to
 do
 API


calls
 on
 the
 models
 or
 to
 house
 and
 and


and
 warehouse
 them
 keep
 them
 on
 prem


keep
 them
 in
 the
 cloud
 and
 that's
 how


people
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 monetize
 open


source


>> it's
 interesting
 because
 I
 I
 hear
 you


that
 okay
 maybe
 the
 value
 doesn't
 keep


acrewing
 to
 the
 closed
 source
 AI


foundation
 labs.
 Um
 or
 maybe
 the
 value


doesn't
 keep
 uh
 acrewing
 to
 the
 one
 GPU


maker
 that
 we
 all
 talk
 about
 all
 the


time.
 And
 yet
 at
 least
 these
 are
 not


consensus
 views
 based
 on
 the
 fact
 that


anthropic
 $183
 billion
 valuation
 or


whatever
 it
 is.
 Nvidia,
 maybe
 it's
 not


at
 an
 all-time
 high
 today,
 but
 more
 or


less
 basically
 a
 stock
 at
 an
 all-time


high.
 These
 are,
 you
 know,
 there
 are


some
 um
 contrarian
 views
 here.
 I
 want
 to


go
 back
 though
 to
 something
 before
 I


forget.
 Um,
 when
 we
 were
 talking
 about


the
 aqua
 hires
 and
 you
 blamed
 it
 on


somewhat
 the
 FTC
 and
 there
 has
 been


continuity
 from
 the
 Biden,
 some


ideological
 continuity
 I
 think
 between


Biden
 and
 the
 new
 Trump
 administration.


I
 don't
 know,
 maybe
 it's
 changed
 a


little
 bit.
 That
 being
 said,
 I
 don't


fully
 buy
 it.
 And
 here's
 why.
 Um
 because


in
 the
 era
 of
 businessto
 business
 SAS


which
 was
 the
 2010s
 let's
 say
 I
 had
 some


Y
 combinator
 company
 and
 I
 like
 all


right
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 all
 build
 a


software
 for
 all
 the
 booking
 for


dentists
 around
 the
 country
 and
 I
 sign


up
 150,000
 dentists
 and
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of


things
 there
 is
 no
 engineer
 who
 can
 just


be
 hired
 away
 and
 replace
 that
 because


it
 was
 the
 network
 effects
 right
 this
 is


what's
 different
 with
 AI
 though
 right
 is


that
 okay
 I'm
 sure
 network
 effects
 are


still
 real
 and
 accumulation
 of
 data
 etc


are
 still
 real
 but
 these
 are
 businesses


that
 are
 a
 lot
 more
 about
 science
 and


having
 had
 the
 experience
 of
 doing
 a


training
 run
 and
 so
 forth.
 So
 how
 on


very
 expensive
 compute
 so
 how
 much
 of


this
 phenomenon
 I
 know
 you
 attributed


some
 of
 it
 to
 FTC
 but
 it
 really
 seems


like
 there
 is
 something
 fundamentally


different
 with
 the
 business
 model
 such


that
 it's
 not
 like
 the
 the
 B2B
 SAS
 era


that
 allows
 uh
 a
 talented
 person
 to
 take


a
 lot
 of
 value
 out
 the
 door
 with
 them.


you
 you
 are
 100%
 correct
 in
 that
 it
 is


more
 sophisticated
 software
 and


algorithms
 than
 your
 traditional
 B2B
 SAS


software
 and
 therefore
 what
 was
 really


valuable
 and
 sticky
 was
 the
 data
 in
 the


regress
 out
 um
 API
 calls
 on
 the
 back
 end


and
 this
 the
 great
 irony
 is
 we
 talk


about
 artificial
 intelligence
 but
 the


thing
 that
 is
 most
 valued
 is
 indeed


today
 human
 intelligence.
 It
 is
 why


somebody
 that
 was
 one
 of
 the
 authors
 on


the
 attention
 is
 all
 you
 need
 paper
 uh


which
 was
 really
 the
 first
 transformer


paper
 the
 T
 of
 GPT
 every
 single
 one
 of


those
 people
 has
 started
 a
 company
 and


we
 backed
 one
 of
 them
 that
 came
 up
 with


the
 name
 of
 that
 paper
 a
 guy
 Leon
 Jones


in
 a
 Japanese
 AI
 company
 called
 Sakana


that's
 taking
 a
 different
 approach
 so


you
 are
 right
 in
 that
 the
 human


intelligence
 of
 this
 in
 this
 early
 stage


which
 is
 why
 you
 are
 seeing
 the


machinations
 with
 the
 breaking
 news


you're
 even
 reporting
 of
 almost
 like
 a


crazy
 NBA
 draft
 or
 football
 or
 MLB,
 you


know,
 trades.
 This
 person
 went
 here
 and


then
 they
 left
 and
 whatever
 and
 then


this
 person's
 getting
 sued
 because
 they


were
 only
 at
 XAI
 for
 three
 months
 and


and
 they
 took
 proprietary
 information


with
 them.
 I
 think
 that
 in
 six
 months


all
 of
 that
 starts
 to
 shake
 out.
 You


will
 have
 geniuses.
 We
 backed
 an


incredible
 genius,
 Scott
 Woo.
 If
 you


look
 up
 uh


>> you
 give
 us
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 to
 Google.


>> He's
 a
 professional
 genius.
 I
 find
 that


so
 funny.


>> He
 is
 a
 professional
 genius.
 But
 but


here's
 the
 thing.
 Uh
 you
 can
 see
 the


video
 of
 him
 in
 sixth
 grade,
 so
 he
 must


have
 been
 12.


>> I
 love
 these
 guys.


>> Winning
 the
 math
 Olympiad
 and
 it's


almost
 like
 you
 think
 it's
 an
 SNL
 skit


because
 you're
 watching
 it.


>> Oh,
 so
 this
 is
 the
 Cognition
 guy,


>> correct?
 Okay.


>> And
 so
 we're
 we're
 large
 investors
 in


Cognition
 and
 he
 has
 attracted
 talent


and
 there's
 no
 way
 that
 Scott
 is
 selling


to
 Google
 or
 Meta.
 I
 mean,
 his
 ambitions


>> uh
 and
 it's
 born
 in
 like
 an
 ethical


long-term
 I
 just
 want
 to
 get
 the
 best


people
 and
 build
 the
 best
 technology.


But
 this
 is
 a
 guy
 at
 12
 years
 old
 is


looking
 at
 this
 crazy
 question
 on
 the


math
 olympiad
 and
 just
 before
 it's
 even


done
 ready
 he's
 like
 25,
 you
 know,
 4,722


and
 you're
 like
 did
 he
 cheat?
 Did
 they


give
 him
 the
 questions
 beforehand?
 So


there
 is
 this
 aptitude
 of
 individuals


that
 you
 are
 correct
 are
 highly
 coveted


and
 highly
 valued
 but
 the
 instantiation


of
 that
 genius
 into
 code
 into


repositories
 into
 algorithms
 means
 that


those
 become
 assets
 that
 do
 persist
 even


if
 the
 person
 comes
 and
 goes.


>> This
 is
 actually
 exactly
 what
 I
 wanted


to
 ask
 you
 about
 which
 is
 are
 you
 seeing


any
 companies
 any
 AI
 shops
 being


particularly
 innovative
 I
 guess
 when
 it


comes
 to
 retaining
 talent.
 Um,
 you
 know,


it
 used
 to
 be
 in
 the
 SAS
 days
 that


having
 a
 pingpong
 table
 and,
 you
 know,


free
 food
 and
 some
 stockbased


incentives,


>> kombucha
 on


>> Yeah,
 that's
 right.
 Um,
 that
 was
 enough


to
 attract
 people
 to
 the
 company
 and


keep
 them.


>> Is
 it
 a
 different
 story
 now?


>> If
 I
 want
 a
 professional
 genius,
 what
 do


I
 need
 to
 do?


>> You
 need
 to
 give
 them
 the
 capital
 to


hire
 the
 very
 best
 people.
 Here,
 here's


the
 thing.
 Geniuses
 don't
 suffer
 fools.


The
 smartest
 people
 that
 I
 know,
 they


are
 antisocial
 only
 with
 people
 who
 they


think
 are
 inferior
 to
 them.
 And
 it


really
 is
 one
 of those
 things.
 You
 see


it
 in
 many
 domains.


>> But
 if
 you
 are
 super
 smart,
 you
 want
 to


be
 around
 super
 smart
 people
 because


it's
 almost
 like
 you
 crave
 stimulation


and
 intellect
 and
 somebody
 that
 can


challenge
 your
 ideas.
 And
 when
 you're


talking
 to
 what
 they
 would
 consider
 a


dummy,
 you
 know,
 you're
 like,
 I
 can't


talk
 to
 this
 person.
 I
 can't
 talk
 to


this
 person
 about
 these
 trivial,


superficial
 things.
 And
 you
 know,
 you


want
 to
 get
 into
 it.
 And
 so
 what
 you


what
 you
 do
 to
 retain
 super
 smart
 people


is
 surround
 them
 with
 super
 smart


people.
 Um
 you
 know
 you
 could
 argue
 I


don't
 know
 um
 you
 know
 really


fashionable
 great
 art
 people
 want
 to
 be


around
 art
 people.
 Amazing
 musicians


want
 to
 be
 around
 amazing
 musicians.


Incredible
 athletes
 want
 to
 play
 with


incredible
 athletes.
 And
 brilliant


technical
 geniuses
 whether
 they're
 in
 AI


or
 they're
 in
 aerospace
 and
 defense
 or


they're
 in
 biotech
 don't
 want
 to
 suffer


fools.
 They
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 around


losers.
 They
 want
 to
 be
 around
 tens
 and


A+es.
 And
 that's
 the
 way
 that
 you
 retain


people.
 Uh
 now
 any
 one
 of
 those
 people


could
 decide
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 off
 and


start
 my
 own
 thing
 which
 by
 the
 way
 is


often
 the
 case
 of
 why
 you
 are
 seeing


people
 leave
 OpenAI
 or
 this
 or
 that.
 As


these
 companies
 start
 with
 geniuses
 and


then
 get
 managers
 and
 different
 layers,


you
 spend
 time
 with
 these
 geniuses
 and


like
 I'm
 not
 reporting
 to
 that


You
 know,
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 start
 my
 own


thing
 and
 attract
 other
 geniuses.
 And


eventually
 then
 they
 need
 to
 hire


managers
 and
 business
 development
 people


and
 sales
 people.
 And
 then
 there's


technical
 people
 that
 like
 I'm
 not


working
 with
 those
 idiots
 and
 they
 go


start
 a
 company.
 So
 that's
 the
 cycle.


>> So
 actually
 um
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 discourse


was
 God.
 It's
 crazy
 how
 recent
 this
 is.


So
 June
 19th
 CNBC
 reported
 that
 Meta
 had


met Meta
 had
 tried
 to
 acquire
 safe
 super


intelligence
 which
 is
 the
 founder
 uh


which
 was
 the
 company
 founded
 by
 the


open
 AI
 co-founder
 ga
 for
 $32
 billion.


This
 is
 a
 company
 that
 as
 far
 as
 I
 know


doesn't
 really
 have
 anything
 that
 anyone


uses.
 So
 they're
 essential
 that
 was


essentially
 attempt
 to
 like
 I'm
 going
 to


pay
 you
 $ 32
 billion
 to
 come
 join
 my


company
 at
 this
 level
 of
 sophistication


and
 skill.
 Are
 they
 is
 do
 you
 sense
 is


the
 talent
 even
 the
 genius
 talent
 is
 it


motivated
 by
 something
 much
 deeper
 than


money
 in
 terms
 of
 like
 no
 there
 is
 this


thing
 out
 there
 maybe
 we
 call
 it
 AGI
 or


maybe
 it's
 some
 big
 scientific


breakthrough
 that
 they
 want
 to
 be
 part


of
 that
 essentially
 no
 amount
 of
 money


can
 buy
 if
 it
 doesn't
 look
 like
 that


ship
 isn't
 out
 there
 chasing
 the
 white


whale


>> in
 in
 SS
 in
 SSI's
 case
 it
 was
 it
 was


Ilia
 um
 and
 you
 know
 look
 I
 think


they're
 all
 super
 confident
 in
 their


ability
 and
 their
 ability
 to
 attract


capital
 number
 one.


>> Number
 two,
 many
 of
 them
 are
 actually


saying
 to
 your
 point
 no
 to
 Zuck.
 They


are
 turning
 him
 down.
 And
 what's
 he


saying
 in
 return?
 You
 don't
 come
 to
 work


for
 me
 almost
 mafiosa
 style.
 I'm
 going


to
 poach
 all
 your
 people.
 But
 that
 kind


of
 message


>> is
 almost
 one
 that
 the
 people
 that
 are


working
 for
 somebody
 like
 Ilia
 or
 Mira


or
 whatever
 are
 like,
 yeah,
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 go
 there.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be,


you
 know,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 work
 with
 six


layers
 of
 product
 managers
 and
 that
 kind


of
 stuff.
 if
 I
 want
 to
 do
 this
 thing
 and


then
 suddenly
 it
 feels
 like
 it's
 the


rebels
 versus
 the
 evil
 empire
 and
 that's


always
 the
 case
 right
 Microsoft
 when
 you


see
 the
 founding
 picture
 of
 these
 nerds


you
 know
 and
 then
 they
 became
 Microsoft


Microsoft
 became
 the
 evil
 empire
 to


Google
 you
 know
 and
 then
 Google
 became


like
 the
 evil
 empire
 to
 like
 Mark
 and


then
 you
 know
 Meta
 became
 the
 evil


empire
 to
 open
 AI
 and
 and
 the
 other


piece
 you
 have
 here
 are
 huge
 individual


egos
 and
 we
 as
 societal
 members
 you
 know


everyday
 lay
 people
 We
 benefit
 from
 it.


We
 benefit
 from
 Elon
 and
 Bezos
 sometimes


being
 sort
 of
 cordial
 to
 each
 other,
 but


basically
 trying
 to
 take
 their
 big
 giant


phallic
 rockets
 and
 send
 them
 up
 to


space.
 And
 we
 all
 benefit
 from
 that.
 We


benefit
 from
 the
 fact
 that
 right
 now
 the


number
 one
 person
 that
 Mark
 Zuckerberg


wants
 to
 beat
 is
 Dennis
 Sabis
 of
 Google.


>> Oh
 yeah.
 won
 the
 Nobel
 Prize
 is
 shipping


at
 an
 insane
 rate
 video
 models,
 image


models,
 text
 models,
 huge
 context


windows
 to
 put
 everything
 you
 have
 in
 um


and
 he's
 like
 h
 I
 need
 to
 beat
 that
 guy.


I
 need
 to
 hire
 the
 best
 scientists
 and


the
 best
 scientific
 team
 and
 where
 do
 I


get
 them
 from?
 And
 so
 part
 of
 this


poachalooa
 isn't
 just
 like
 the
 future
 of


meta
 because
 you
 know
 these
 pay
 packages


at
 a
 $2
 trillion
 market
 cap
 or
 higher
 to


spend
 1%
 of
 your
 market
 cap
 you
 know
 $20


billion
 on
 all
 this
 talent
 is
 nothing.


It's
 like
 a
 flyer
 and
 but
 to
 win
 a
 Nobel


Prize
 for
 figuring
 out
 how
 to
 do
 protein


folding
 in
 AI
 or
 develop
 the
 next
 drug


or
 come
 up
 with
 a
 cure
 for
 Alzheimer's


or
 solve
 some
 geopolitical
 issue.
 That


is
 a
 big
 deal
 and
 that's
 what
 many


people
 are
 chasing
 now.
 They
 want
 to


make
 history.


>> So
 you
 touched
 on
 hardware
 and
 also


closed
 source
 models.
 Are
 there
 any


other
 areas
 in
 the
 AI
 space
 that
 you


think
 are
 maybe
 overhyped
 at
 the
 moment?


>> You
 know,
 I've
 characterized
 this
 before


as
 everything
 in
 2D
 to
 me
 feels


overhyped.


>> Voice,
 video,
 image,
 text,
 it's
 all


going
 to
 continue
 to
 improve
 somewhat


incrementally,
 but
 it's
 good
 enough.
 And


in
 the
 history
 of
 evolution


biologically,
 most
 of
 what
 evolved
 was


good
 enough.
 You
 know,
 from
 everything


in
 our
 bodies
 to
 nature
 and
 trees
 and


it's
 just
 it's
 good
 enough.
 And
 so
 that


you're
 going
 to
 reach
 an
 asmtote
 of
 good


enough
 on
 all
 the
 twodimensional
 stuff.


Today
 with
 oneshot
 learning,
 meaning


maybe
 30
 seconds
 of
 audio,
 11
 labs
 or


some
 of
 the
 other
 voice
 models
 can


capture
 you
 with
 an
 iniccernable


probably
 90%
 similarity.
 Maybe
 your
 your


spouse,
 your
 loved
 ones,
 your
 families


would
 be
 like, "Ah,
 it
 doesn't
 sound


like
 him."
 But
 the
 vast
 majority
 of


these
 things
 are
 getting
 so
 good
 that


with
 very
 little
 training,
 they
 can


emulate
 and
 predict
 and
 do
 all
 the


things
 that
 are
 of
 high
 utility.
 What's


scarcer
 is
 the
 three-dimensional
 world,


particularly
 robotics,
 which
 we've


talked
 about
 in
 the
 past,
 and
 biology.


In
 part,
 because
 you
 have
 large


unstructured
 data
 sets.
 A
 robot
 walking


in
 and
 figuring
 out
 how
 much
 force
 to


use
 with
 this
 cup
 30
 minutes
 ago
 when
 it


was
 full
 versus
 now
 when
 it's
 empty
 is


something
 that
 we
 all
 do
 intuitively.


The
 second
 you
 grasp
 it,
 you
 know


exactly
 how
 much
 force
 to
 use
 so
 that


you
 don't
 throw
 it
 over
 your
 head
 or
 you


know
 have
 an
 inability
 to
 lift
 it


because
 it's
 too
 heavy.
 All
 of
 that
 kind


of
 training
 is
 really
 scarce
 and
 there's


very
 few
 companies
 that
 are
 doing
 that.


So
 the
 entire
 robotic
 ecosystem
 from
 the


embodied
 intelligence
 and
 the
 AI
 models


and
 the
 world
 models
 to
 the
 motors
 and


the
 gears
 and
 the
 uh
 supply
 chain
 for


that
 mostly
 doiciled
 in
 China
 is
 a
 big


area
 of
 opportunity.
 The
 other
 big
 area


of
 opportunity
 is
 biology.
 Being
 able
 to


go
 from
 a
 prompt
 to
 a
 protein
 to
 be
 able


to
 design
 a
 drug
 biology
 is
 really


complicated.
 Computer
 scientists
 often


underestimate
 how
 hard
 biology
 is


because
 they're
 used
 to
 2D
 linear
 inputs


outputs.
 Here's
 my
 code.
 It
 works.
 But


biologists
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 also


massively
 underestimate
 how


sophisticated
 computer
 science
 has
 got.


So
 that's
 a
 really
 interesting
 ripe


area.
 Um
 so
 2D
 overhyped


GPUs
 overhyped
 out
 of
 necessity
 of
 both


scarcity
 and
 geopolitical
 thwarting
 of


China.
 We're
 going
 to
 have
 edge


inference
 chips
 whether
 it's
 memory
 or


other
 things
 that
 are
 going
 to
 be
 on


device.
 The
 other
 area
 that
 I
 think
 is


an
 inevitability
 and
 I've
 coined
 a
 word


for
 this
 I
 call
 life
 cording.


Um,
 life
 cording
 are
 little
 devices,
 you


know,
 I
 I
 have
 one
 here.
 I'm
 not
 an


investor
 in
 these
 guys,
 but
 there's


little
 devices
 that
 you
 can
 carry
 around


that
 passively
 record


>> uh
 24
 hours
 a
 day.


>> Now,
 older
 people
 might
 be
 like,
 Stevie,


don't
 like
 that.
 Feels
 invasive.


Privacy.
 That
 has
 always
 been
 the


trade-off
 between
 privacy
 and


convenience,
 between
 security
 and


unleashing
 all
 kinds
 of
 things.
 It
 is


super
 valuable
 to
 me
 to
 figure
 out
 uh


who
 was
 I
 talking
 about
 that
 was
 it
 was


it
 Joe
 or
 was
 it
 my
 wife?
 I
 can't


remember
 who
 I
 had
 that
 conversation


with
 and
 I
 query
 the
 thing
 and
 it
 was


passively
 recording
 and
 maybe
 it
 doesn't


keep
 the
 audio
 but
 it
 keeps
 the
 text
 and


it's
 able
 to
 search
 and
 query
 it.
 That


is
 going
 to
 become
 an
 inevitability.


Students
 will
 use
 it.
 People
 in
 everyday


business
 you
 might
 ask
 hey
 is
 it
 okay


that
 I'm
 recording?
 But
 I
 think
 socially


people
 will
 become
 comfortable
 first


with
 audio
 and
 then
 with
 glasses
 that


are
 passively
 recording
 every
 30
 seconds


or
 a
 minute
 capturing
 your
 environment


able
 to
 provide
 context
 around
 it
 and


then
 click
 a
 button
 high
 resolution


recording


>> and
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 super
 valuable


and
 very
 competitive
 area


>> and
 very
 controversial
 freak
 the
 heck


out
 about
 this


>> an
 incredible
 utility
 and
 look
 people


have
 freaked
 out


>> there
 was
 a
 guy
 that
 said


>> these
 these
 these
 These
 devices
 are


going
 to
 ruin
 human
 memory.
 They're


going
 to
 destroy
 human
 memory,
 which


was,
 you
 know,
 Plato
 and
 Socrates


talking
 about
 writing
 utensils,
 you


know,
 because


>> I
 know,
 but
 that's
 voluntary
 because


when
 you
 write
 at least
 you're
 recording


me
 when
 we're
 doing
 this,
 I
 heard
 about


someone
 on
 a
 date
 in
 San
 Francisco
 and


the
 date
 was
 record.
 That's
 weird
 stuff.


>> It's
 very
 weird
 and
 I


>> But
 but
 here's


>> it
 could
 be
 very
 big,
 but
 it's
 super


weird.
 people
 already
 believe,
 you
 know,


that
 there's
 an
 invisible
 man
 in
 the
 sky


that
 is
 looking
 down
 on
 them
 and
 judging


them,
 these
 kinds
 of
 things.


>> Oh,
 I
 see
 what
 you're
 saying.


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 have
 an


opinion
 on
 that
 question.


>> We
 we've
 got
 a
 technological
 god
 around


us
 that
 people
 are
 going
 to
 either
 feel


comfortable
 with
 and
 not
 and
 there's


going
 to
 be
 a
 bifurcation.
 And
 by
 the


way,
 there's
 another
 weird
 thing
 coming.


You
 want
 to
 get
 weird.
 Okay,
 you
 already


see
 some
 breadcrumbs
 of
 this
 and
 it's


super
 weird.
 The
 number
 one
 and
 two
 uses


of
 all
 our
 language
 large
 language


models
 and
 chat
 bots
 are
 advice,


companionship.
 Yeah.


>> You
 know,
 people
 using
 them
 as


therapists
 and
 seeking
 and
 people
 used


to
 joke
 about
 this
 like
 your
 Google


searches,
 you
 know,
 reveal
 more
 about


you
 than
 you
 may
 have
 revealed
 to
 your


spouse.
 Um
 the
 things
 that
 people
 feel


comfortable
 asking
 a
 chatbot
 about.
 You


know,
 whether
 it's
 a
 body
 issue
 or
 a


psychological
 issue
 or
 relationship


advice,
 you
 know,
 if
 those
 things
 were


revealed
 would
 be
 pretty
 scary.
 There's


going
 to
 become
 dependency
 and
 psychosis


that
 develop
 as
 the
 relationship
 between


man
 and
 machine
 start
 to
 become
 very


symbiotic
 and
 you
 will
 see
 I
 predict
 and


I
 wrote
 about
 this
 in
 our
 quarterly


letter
 Lux
 that
 there
 is
 a
 cohort
 of


people
 that
 basically
 start
 fighting
 for


AI
 rights.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> We're
 going
 to
 be
 sitting
 there
 like


>> Yeah.
 I
 came
 across
 a
 think
 tank
 today


that's
 focused
 on
 that
 because
 right


that
 the
 like
 if
 there's
 animal
 rights


and
 the
 AI
 says
 you're
 hurting
 me
 if
 you


turn
 off
 the
 machine
 then
 well
 well


maybe
 it's
 true
 maybe
 we
 have
 to
 take


that
 seriously
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 weird


this
 is
 a
 weird
 stuff
 that's
 coming


>> people
 are
 going
 to
 be
 marching
 in
 the


streets
 you
 know
 protesting
 don't
 turn


off
 my
 language
 model
 keep
 my
 memory


don't
 erase
 it
 my
 memory


>> I
 thought
 about
 this
 um
 when
 you
 know


after
 G
 uh
 the
 I
 guess
 GPT5
 was
 revealed


and
 a
 bunch
 of
 there
 was
 a
 bunch
 of


changes
 to
 the
 voice
 and
 a
 bunch
 of


people
 on
 Reddit,
 they're
 like,
 "Oh,
 my


AI
 boyfriend
 talks
 totally
 differently


now."
 And
 then
 there
 was
 some
 pressure.


This
 is
 just
 day
 one
 around
 here.
 I


would
 be
 very
 uncomfortable
 getting
 into


a
 relationship
 with
 a
 model
 that
 was


closed
 source
 and
 therefore
 um
 uh
 a
 very


at
 risk
 of
 the
 company
 changing
 model.


Josh
 Lux,
 we
 could
 go
 on
 forever.
 We


should
 another
 time.
 Always
 great


catching
 up
 with
 you.
 Always
 fun.
 Always


a
 little
 freaky.
 Thanks
 for
 coming
 on.


>> Great
 to
 see
 you
 both.
 Thank
 you.


>> Thanks
 so
 much,
 Josh.


>> Take
 care,
 Josh.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much,


Tracy.
 I
 love
 talking
 to
 Josh.
 I'm


really
 concerned
 about
 this
 whole
 life


recording
 thing,
 but
 I
 know
 it's


happening.
 There
 was
 a
 good
 article
 I


think
 in
 the
 um
 SF
 Standard.
 I
 read
 like


it's
 not
 just
 a
 theoretical
 thing
 that
 a


lot
 of people
 are.
 It's
 happening.
 It's


mostly
 in
 San
 Francisco
 so
 far,
 but
 it's


coming
 for
 everyone.


>> I
 am
 very
 curious
 how
 life
 courting


stacks
 up
 with
 uh
 California's
 laws
 on


like
 whether
 or
 not
 you
 can
 record


someone
 without
 their
 knowledge.


Is
 it
 the
 case
 that
 like
 from
 now
 on
 if


you
 have
 one
 of
 these
 devices
 like
 the


first
 thing
 you
 have
 to
 say
 to
 everyone


you
 meet
 is
 like
 by
 the
 way
 do
 you
 mind


if
 I
 record
 you


>> by
 the
 way
 I'm
 life
 cording
 this


conversation
 is
 that
 no
 or
 like
 but
 it


doesn't
 m
 you
 know
 or
 you
 have
 glasses


or
 something
 yeah
 it's
 very
 um
 it's
 very


strange
 I
 also
 think


>> this
 AI
 rights
 thing
 we
 have
 to
 talk


about
 more
 I
 don't
 know
 when
 we'll
 get


back
 to
 it
 but
 I
 literally
 just
 this


morning
 came
 across
 an
 organization


that's
 you
 know
 this
 idea
 okay
 there
 is


already
 evidence
 of
 sensience
 and


therefore
 with
 sensience
 comes
 some
 sort


of
 moral
 agency
 and
 so
 in
 the
 same
 way


that
 we
 talk
 about
 animal
 rights
 as


being
 somewhat
 important
 do
 we
 have
 to


take
 seriously
 I
 don't
 this
 all
 seems


very
 strange
 to
 me
 and
 then
 of
 course


the
 psychosis
 induced
 by
 what
 happens


when
 your
 AI
 partner
 or
 therapist


changes
 models
 and
 changes
 voices
 and


therefore
 and
 that
 was
 just
 the
 end
 of


the
 conversation


>> you
 know
 if
 AI
 models
 have
 rights
 then


you
 have
 to
 start
 asking
 if
 robots
 have


rights
 right
 and
 then
 and
 then
 you


should
 start
 asking
 should
 robots
 be


paid
 a
 fair
 wage
 and
 I
 think
 there's


actually
 an
 interesting
 thought


experiment
 that
 you
 could
 do
 about
 that


and
 make
 like
 a
 relatively
 strong
 case


that
 we
 should
 pay
 the
 robots.


>> Who
 collects
 the
 money
 and
 what
 do
 they


spend
 it
 on?


>> Yeah,
 that's


I
 mean
 this
 is
 this
 is
 like
 we're
 we're


basically
 at
 what
 all
 of
 sci-fi
 has
 been


discussing
 for
 the
 entire
 history
 of
 sci


on
 the
 less
 speculative
 stuff.
 I
 like


talking
 to
 Josh.
 I
 like
 his
 sort
 of


counter
 um
 counter
 consensus
 calls
 on


GPUs
 and
 closed
 source
 models.
 I
 really


liked
 his
 answer
 on
 founder
 liquidity


that
 sometimes
 you
 can
 maybe
 keep
 the


founder
 sticking
 with
 the
 mission
 as


opposed
 to
 bailing
 with
 the
 mission
 if


you
 can
 derisk
 them
 and
 they
 can
 have


enough
 money
 to
 go
 on
 a
 date.


>> I
 like
 the
 idea
 that
 everyone's
 life


view
 is
 basically
 dictated
 by
 where
 they


are
 in
 the
 capital
 staff.
 That's
 right.


Words
 to
 live
 by.


>> Extremely
 real.


>> Shall
 we
 leave
 it
 there?


>> Yeah,
 let's
 leave
 it
 there.


>> All right.
