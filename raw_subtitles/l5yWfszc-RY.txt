Let's
 talk
 about
 new
 research
 on
 GLP-1


drugs
 like
 Ompic
 and
 WGOI
 that
 suggests


they
 may
 be
 able
 to
 treat
 addiction
 and


possibly
 depression.
 One
 study
 involving


patients
 with
 opioid
 use
 disorder
 found


that
 GLP-1
 medication
 reduced
 cravings


by
 40%
 over
 the
 course
 of
 3
 weeks.


Another
 looked
 at
 the
 health
 records
 of


more
 than
 a
 million
 people
 with
 alcohol


use
 disorder
 or
 opioid
 use
 disorder.
 It


found
 people
 taking
 GLP-1s
 had
 a
 50%


lower
 rate
 of
 alcohol
 intoxication
 and
 a


40%
 lower
 rate
 of
 opioid
 overdose.
 I
 sat


down
 with
 Dr.
 Anna
 LMK,
 professor
 and


medical
 director
 of
 addiction
 medicine


at
 Stanford
 University
 to
 learn
 more.


[music]


Dr.
 Lemi,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 joining


us
 on
 the
 rundown.
 How
 are
 you
 doing


today?


>> I'm
 doing
 well.
 Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> Of
 course.
 Um
 as
 we
 noted
 some
 really


good
 signs
 early
 signs
 uh
 when
 we
 look


at
 GLP1s
 and
 sort
 of
 addiction.
 How


would
 you
 characterize
 the
 promise
 uh


with
 GLP1s
 and
 say
 ompic
 uh
 when
 it


comes
 to
 treating
 addiction?


>> Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 I
 think
 it's
 worth


noting
 that
 we
 reached
 a
 point
 in
 human


history
 when
 we
 actually
 need
 a


medication
 to
 help
 us
 eat
 less.
 For
 most


of
 human
 existence,
 we
 have
 spent
 the


majority
 of
 our
 day
 looking
 for
 enough


food.
 Now,
 we're
 struggling
 to
 resist


food.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 uh,
 molecules


like
 GLP1s
 are
 a
 way
 to
 adapt
 to
 a
 an


environment
 of
 abundance.
 And
 so,
 I


think
 that
 in
 itself
 is
 fascinating.
 Um,


the
 promise
 of
 GLP1s
 is
 enormous.
 uh
 the


signal
 that
 we're
 seeing
 now
 in
 terms
 of


helping
 people
 curb
 appetite,
 lose


weight,
 uh
 normalize
 blood
 sugar
 is
 is


just
 really
 really
 exciting.
 Um
 as
 well


as
 its
 potential
 promise
 in
 treating


addiction
 more
 broadly,
 alcohol


addiction,
 opioid
 addiction,
 nicotine


addiction.
 It's
 it's
 just
 really
 an


exciting
 moment
 to
 have
 a
 new
 new
 tool


in
 what
 is
 um
 a
 pretty
 limited
 toolbox


at
 this
 point.
 help
 us
 understand
 the


science
 here.
 How
 does
 it
 actually
 work?


>> So,
 the
 GLP1s
 mimic
 a
 molecule
 that
 we


make
 in
 our
 bodies
 that's
 released
 in


the
 gut
 after
 we
 eat
 that
 signals
 to
 the


body,
 okay,
 you've
 had
 enough
 food,
 you


can
 stop
 eating.
 As
 well
 as
 leading
 to


the
 release
 of
 insulin
 and
 other


hormones
 which
 lower
 blood
 sugars
 and


again
 contribute
 to
 that
 feeling
 of


fullness.
 So
 they
 essentially
 augment
 or


amplify
 something
 that
 our
 body
 does


already.


>> Are
 there
 any
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 the


potential
 and
 its
 effectiveness,
 are


they
 potentially
 more
 effective
 with


certain
 types
 of
 addictions?
 Is
 there


are
 we
 seeing
 it
 with
 alcohol?
 Are
 we


seeing
 it
 with
 opioids?


>> Well,
 remember
 they
 really
 originated
 to


treat
 type
 2
 diabetes
 and
 related


obesity.
 Um,
 and
 it's
 really
 kind
 of
 a


serendipitous
 or
 secondary
 uh
 awareness


that
 oh
 wow
 this
 their
 ability
 to
 help


with
 uh
 decreasing
 food
 intake
 might


actually
 help
 with
 other
 addictions
 as


well.
 So
 the
 strongest
 early
 signal
 has


been
 with
 alcohol,
 not
 surprisingly


because
 alcohol
 is
 also
 a
 carbohydrate,


right?
 And
 so
 that's
 calorie
 mediated.


That
 wasn't
 really
 the
 hugest
 surprise,


although
 you
 know,
 a
 welcome
 early


signal.
 What
 has
 been
 surprising
 is
 some


of
 the
 other
 potential
 effects
 of
 the


GLP1s
 like
 its
 potential
 effect
 on
 an


opioid
 addiction,
 a
 nicotine
 addiction,


or
 even
 what
 we
 call
 behavioral


addictions.
 These
 are
 like
 things
 that


we
 do
 like,
 you
 know,
 a
 gambling


addiction
 or
 a
 sex
 addiction.
 Uh,
 in


that
 people
 are
 now
 looking
 at
 the


possibility
 of
 GLP1s
 in
 that
 arena
 as


well.
 In
 your
 book,
 Dopamine
 Nation,
 you


write
 that
 we
 are
 increasingly


vulnerable
 to
 addiction.
 I'm
 curious,
 do


we
 need
 a
 treatment
 like
 GLP1's
 in
 our


arsenal
 to
 fight
 back?


>> Yes,
 for
 exactly
 the
 reasons
 that
 I


alluded
 to
 before,
 because
 we
 live
 in


this
 world
 of
 abundance
 where
 almost


everything
 has
 been
 drugified
 in
 some


way.
 That
 is
 to
 say,
 made
 more
 potently


reinforcing,
 more
 accessible,
 more


bountiful.


um
 we're
 now
 struggling
 as
 a
 species
 to


limit
 our
 consumption
 um
 to
 not
 get


addicted
 and
 as
 a
 result
 we
 need
 more


help
 in
 this
 arena
 just
 because
 we're


really
 in
 many
 ways
 um
 such
 slaves
 to


our
 environment.
 We
 think
 of
 these


diseases
 of
 addiction
 as
 being
 in
 our


brains
 but
 really
 they're
 in
 the
 space


between
 our
 brains
 and
 the
 environment.


So,
 um,
 we're
 constantly
 looking
 for
 and


inventing
 with
 increasing
 frequency,
 um,


tools
 to
 help
 with
 repetitive
 control,


which
 which
 essentially
 amount
 to
 some


kind
 of
 barrier
 between
 ourselves
 and


this
 problem
 of
 over
 uh,
 compulsive


overconumption.


>> I
 want
 to
 change
 gears
 a
 little
 bit.


What
 are
 we
 learning
 about
 GLP1s
 and


potentially
 treating
 depression?


>> Yeah,
 so
 this
 is
 a
 really
 exciting
 and


unexpected
 arena.
 Um,
 a
 lot
 of
 folks


just
 anecdotally
 who
 were
 put
 on
 GLP1s


for
 diabetes
 or
 obesity
 um,
 endorse


elevated
 mood.
 And
 initially
 the


thinking
 was,
 well,
 that's
 just
 because


they're
 happy
 they're
 losing
 weight.
 But


it
 really
 looks
 like
 there
 may
 be
 a


separate
 chemical
 phenomenon
 going
 on


here
 where
 GLP1s
 might
 actually
 work
 as


an
 anti-depressant.
 There
 are
 at
 least


five
 placeboc
 controlled
 trials
 now


showing
 their
 effectiveness
 in
 uh


treating
 depression
 compared
 to
 a


placebo
 which
 is
 to
 say
 a
 sugar
 pill


which
 is
 the
 gold
 standard
 of
 how
 we


measure
 uh
 the
 effectiveness
 of
 various


medications.
 So
 um
 that's
 that's
 really


really
 interesting.
 I
 think
 there's


going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 more
 research
 in
 this


arena
 because
 of
 course
 our


armamentarium
 for
 treating
 depression
 is


also
 quite
 limited
 and
 there
 are
 lots
 of


folks
 who
 have
 treatment
 refractory


depression
 who
 don't
 respond
 to
 our


typical
 treatments.
 So
 the
 idea
 that


maybe
 there's
 a
 new
 kit
 on
 the
 block
 uh


that
 might
 help
 folks
 uh
 by
 working


through
 a
 totally
 novel
 mechanism
 is
 is


really
 exciting.


>> I'm
 hoping
 you
 can
 also
 break
 this
 down


for
 us,
 get
 a
 little
 sciency
 for
 us,
 but


some
 depressions
 may
 be
 related
 to


increased
 inflammation.
 Uh,
 so
 help
 us


understand
 how
 exactly
 GLP1
 helps
 with


that.


>> Yeah,
 I
 wish
 I
 could
 I
 wish
 I
 could
 help


you
 understand
 exactly,
 but
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 think
 anybody
 exactly
 understands


how
 this
 works.
 But
 that's
 been
 another


interesting
 sort
 of
 side
 finding
 related


to
 the
 GLP1s
 that
 they
 seem
 to
 modulate


the
 inflammatory
 response.
 So,
 a
 huge


mediator
 of
 our
 inflammatory
 or
 immune


response
 actually
 comes
 from
 the
 gut


lining.
 And
 the
 GLP1's
 impact
 on
 hormone


release
 in
 the
 gut
 uh
 also
 seems
 to


contribute
 to
 an
 anti-inflammatory


response.
 And
 so
 there's
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 interest
 in
 that
 arena
 and
 and
 the


possibility
 that
 its
 anti-inflammatory


effects
 that
 is
 it's
 calming
 down
 our


immune
 system
 uh
 might
 make
 it


exploitable
 or
 useful
 to
 treat
 all


different
 kinds
 of
 disease
 processes
 pro


processes
 that
 are
 related
 to
 um
 a
 a
 an


over
 like
 an
 excessive
 inflammatory


response
 starting
 with
 diabetes,
 right?


because
 that
 that
 is
 related,
 but
 also


um
 um
 other
 kinds
 of
 gut
 inflammatory


diseases
 and
 possibly
 mood
 disorders


that
 might
 be
 related
 to
 an
 autoimmune


or
 inflammatory
 response.


>> As
 you
 mentioned,
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 is
 in


its
 early
 stages,
 but
 just
 us
 talking


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 excitement
 uh
 on
 the


research
 side
 of
 where
 we
 can
 go,
 but
 I


do
 want
 to
 have
 a
 conversation
 about


access.
 Uh
 GLP1s
 are
 of
 course
 in
 high


demand.
 um
 will
 people
 be
 able
 to


properly
 access
 them
 when
 they
 are


deemed
 effective?


>> Yeah,
 so
 this
 is
 a
 huge
 problem
 because


right
 now
 they're
 really
 only
 FDA


approved
 for
 the
 treatment
 of
 diabetes


and
 obesity.
 Uh
 and
 you
 need
 FDA


approval
 typically
 to
 have
 insurance
 pay


for
 it,
 at least
 the
 United
 States.
 Um,


so
 I
 personally
 have
 a
 number
 of


patients
 who
 I
 would
 like
 to
 prescribe


GLP-1s
 to
 who
 I
 think
 would
 benefit
 uh


from
 it
 uh
 for
 a
 variety
 of
 different


indications
 and
 yet
 who
 can't
 get
 it


paid
 for
 by
 their
 insurance
 because
 it


they're
 not
 they
 don't
 struggle
 with


diabetes
 or
 obesity
 per
 se
 and
 can't


afford
 it
 on
 their
 own.
 So
 this
 is
 a
 big


problem.
 Um
 and
 you
 know
 I
 think
 um
 you


know
 there
 is
 an
 increasing
 awareness
 of


trying
 to
 make
 uh
 these
 drugs
 more


affordable
 and
 more
 accessible
 for
 the


average
 person
 which
 is
 really


important.


>> One
 last
 question
 for
 you
 Dr.
 LMKI.
 Um


you
 know
 of
 course
 a
 lot
 of
 attention
 on


sort
 of
 where
 we
 can
 go
 with
 this
 with


GLP1s
 but
 are
 they
 safe?
 Do
 we
 know
 that


they're
 safe?


>> Well
 they're
 safe
 to
 the
 extent
 that


they're
 FDA
 approved.
 So
 that
 you
 know


um
 any
 medication
 that
 goes
 through
 the


FDA
 process
 uh
 gets
 tested
 for
 safety


but
 it's
 also
 very
 well
 established
 that


even
 once
 a
 medication
 is
 FDA
 approved


once
 it's
 on
 the
 market
 there
 will
 be


adverse
 effects
 and
 adverse
 phenomenon


that
 manifest
 um
 as
 they
 become
 more
 um


ubiquitous
 or
 prevalent
 in
 the


population.
 every
 medication
 has
 side


effects.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 that
 they're


unpredictable.
 Some
 individuals
 will
 not


experience
 any
 side
 effects.
 Other


individuals
 may
 have
 very
 serious
 side


effects.
 So,
 you
 know,
 it's
 really


important
 to
 inform
 patients
 and
 for
 for


patients
 to
 know
 about
 all
 the
 side


effects
 that
 do
 go
 along
 with
 the
 GLP1s.


Um,
 and
 any
 any
 taking
 any
 medication,


prescribing
 any
 medic
 any
 medication
 is


always
 going
 to
 be
 a
 costbenefit


analysis.
 Do
 the
 benefits
 of
 this


medication
 outweigh
 the
 risks?
 But
 there


there's
 no
 medication
 that's
 risk-f


free.
 And
 so
 so
 it's
 important
 to
 to


remember
 that.
 Dr.
 Lkey,
 we're
 going
 to


have
 to
 leave
 it
 there.
 Really


appreciate
 your
 time
 and
 your
 expertise.


Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 joining
 us.


>> You're
 welcome.
