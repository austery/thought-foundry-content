>> We are here to make an
announcement regarding a
lengthy investigation into
organised crime and police
corruption.
>> Earlier this month, police
chiefs from Toronto and York
region dropped a bombshell.
Seven Toronto police officers
and one retired cop had been
arrested in what is being
described as one of the biggest
corruption cases the service
has ever faced. The
investigation, called Project
South, started when a veteran
officer allegedly leaked the
home address of a corrections
officer to an accused drug
trafficker, police say that led
to an attempted hit. When
authorities looked into that,
they uncovered more a whole lot
more allegations involving guns,
drugs, bribery and obstruction
of justice, among other things.
Now, the province's inspector
general of policing has ordered
an Ontario wide review of
police services and boards. So
what exactly have officers been
accused of and what happens
next? And zooming out, what
does a scandal like this do to
public trust? We check out an
index that lists countries
according to how corrupt their
public sectors are perceived to
be, and find out where Canada
ranks and why. Welcome to The
Rundown. Project South has led
to criminal charges against
multiple Toronto police
officers and allegations of
involvement with organised
crime. So what do we know so
far? Jennifer Pagliaro is the
Toronto Star's crime reporter
and has been following this
story closely. And she joins me
in studio. How are you doing?
>> Good. Thanks so much for
having me.
>> There is a lot to uncover
here. We are learning a bit
more about the officers and the
civilians involved. Give us the
latest.
>> So we just reported that
some of the officers were
involved in a little bit more
detailed allegations from the
police that they, one of them
was involved with a civilian
who's also charged as part of
this project, helping advise
her on how to install a GPS
tracker on another woman's car.
It allegedly damaged her car,
and that woman also felt
harassed when she was followed
using this tracker. And
ultimately, police say she
feared for her safety. Now, a
Toronto police officer is
charged jointly with a civilian
in that allegation, which is, I
think, shocking to a lot of
people.
>> And I'm. Correct me if I'm
wrong. Was there a gun also
found as well?
>> Yes. The civilian had a very
old model gun that she was
allegedly keeping in a unlocked
drawer inside of an envelope in
her residence, which she was
charged with carelessly storing.
We're not sure how she got the
gun. If the officer
participated in helping her in
any way. He's not charged with
that, but of course, concerning
nonetheless.
>> And there was another
officer, something closely
related to insurance fraud or
something with a car. What do
we know?
>> Yeah, there's an officer who
allegedly counselled one of his
associates on how he could help
have that car stolen so that
that person could claim an
illegal insurance fraud on the
stolen car, which would have
been a setup, essentially. We
know that the person whose name
is on that court record, that
name is also known to us as
being one of the Peel Region
police officers who is
suspended but not criminally
charged. No one would confirm
that they're the same person.
But of course, that name has
popped up now on the court
record, and that person
allegedly never went through
with the stealing insurance
fraud scheme. And so that's why
that person's not criminally
charged. But the officer
involved, Sergeant Robert Black,
is charged with counselling him
on how to commit insurance
fraud.
>> All right. We were making
the comment that it feels like
this is an onion just being,
you know, we're peeling and
seeing the layers. There's a
lot to it. I want to take a
step back just to kind of make
sure we have all of the details
here at the moment. How many
officers have been charged and
with what if you can give us
sort of some of the more
extreme charges versus some of
the lesser ones?
>> Yeah. So seven active duty
Toronto police officers were
charged, as well as one retired
police officer. The interesting
bit there is he and his son are
co-accused in this case. His
son only has around four years
on the force and they're
charged with a host of things.
Some of the more serious
charges is the officers are
actually charged themselves in
trafficking drugs, not just in
aiding in that criminal
activity, as well as accepting
bribes and searching police
databases, essentially leaking
personal information that's on
these confidential databases to
known alleged criminals who
were then disseminating it. And
we know that that has led to a
series of crimes, including
conspiracy to commit a murder
against a Toronto jail official
and also a shooting various
homes through the GTA.
>> Fair to say the conspiracy
to commit murder. The most
serious charge on that list.
>> It is.
>> All right. The now we do.
You had mentioned Peel police
as well. Three officers who
have been suspended, not
criminally charged. Do we know
anything on that if that's
going to turn into anything?
>> Yeah. Well, we got a bit of
a clue recently with that name
that we saw that may have been
involved in the insurance fraud.
We don't know too much about
what these other officers are
alleged to have done, or
whether they're just under
suspicion at this time and have
been suspended pending
investigation. We just know
that they don't have criminal
charges, and we're not sure if
they will warrant criminal
charges, but we're watching
that very closely.
>> In terms of the precincts,
throw out some numbers.
Obviously, for a lot of
reviewers, they probably won't
know where they are, but just a
general description of where
where they are.
>> Yeah. So most of these
officers, the active officers
were assigned to divisions in
sort of the northwest part of
the city. So in the Black Creek
North York areas, there was one
officer assigned to a down like
a right downtown core division.
We know that some of the
officers were working at the
same divisions, 12 division
that's in that Black Creek area.
So we're still piecing together
how all of the officers may
have known one another or came
to know one another. In the
past, for example, we've been
able to figure out that some of
the officers who have all been
sort of 19 years of service
between them, may have
graduated from police college
together. And they also worked
at 12 Division together early
in their careers. So perhaps
those relationships were
maintained. We're still trying
to understand what those
allegations are and what the
conspiracy is on at a big
picture level.
>> All right. I want to talk
about one constable whose name
really surfaced in the
beginning, Constable Tim
Barnhart. Who is he? What have
we learning more of?
>> Yeah. So he's one of those
12 division officers. He's been
on the force for 19 years. He's
been a constable that whole
time, which means typically at
a division you're like a rogue
cop. You go out to nine, 11
calls or anything that requires
your attention. He is one of
those officers who is himself
charged with trafficking in
drugs. He is an officer who we
know is alleged to have leaked
the address of the jail
official, who then these
alleged criminals tried to kill.
Okay. And we also know that he
is involved in other alleged
conspiracies, such as trying to
protect illegal pot shops in
the city. We know cannabis was
legalised. There are still
issues with illegal marijuana,
and so there's a whole host of
allegations of obstructing
justice, falsely accusing
people trafficking in drugs, as
I said, and that involvement in
the eventual conspiracy to
commit murder.
>> Now, I know at the press
conference when Toronto police
unveiled the investigation,
there were questions posed to
Project South ties to the tow
truck wars that have been in
the headlines for quite a while
in GTA. What do we know? Is
there is there a stronger
connection there? What do we
know about that?
>> Yeah, we were sort of
surprised when the press
conference happened. My
colleague Abby O'Brien was
there, and she's been covering
this tow truck issue a lot, and
we Recognized one of the names
of the civilians. That person
was previously arrested for the
incidents. I mentioned shooting
up various houses in the GTA,
including in Vaughan. One of
those houses allegedly belongs
to a so-called kingpin in this
tow truck industry, which, you
know, your viewers may have
seen, as you mentioned, that
there's been a lot of
infighting to the extent of,
you know, calling it a war.
Shootings back and forth
repeatedly in these locations,
home addresses, tow truck yards.
It's been really problematic.
>> One has to ask. And this was
a question that was asked at
that press conference as well.
But have any criminal cases
been compromised because of the
probe into police corruption?
>> We've been actively
searching that out. We've been
talking to criminal defence
lawyers to find that out. So
far, I haven't heard of any
cases falling apart, but I
think it's still a little bit
early days for that. And that
is obviously a huge concern.
>> All right. We mentioned
Ontario's Inspectorate of
Policing is launching a review
into all police departments
across Ontario. Does that mean
the problem goes beyond just a
few bad apples? Obviously this
case here is really tied into
the the GTA for the most part.
But does this problem go beyond
that?
>> Yeah, I think it's a valid
question. I'm personally really
curious to see what the
inspector general finds. I
don't think we have any
allegations beyond this Toronto
Police Department. And, you
know, those three Peel officers
who have not been criminally
charged. However, there are
some bigger questions about
supervision, the way police
have access to sensitive
information and just overall,
their ability to be
incentivised to work with this,
these criminal entities. And I
think it's worth exploring. Of
course, I'll be very interested
to know how deeply they go on
the Toronto police force and
whether they uncover any more
systemic issues with that force.
>> Let's talk reaction.
Political leaders, of course,
have been quick to jump on sort
of their thoughts on here,
police unions as well. How are
they reacting so far?
>> Well, there were some
questions about whether Toronto
Police Chief Myron Demko was
going to face questions of
leadership so far, talking to
people behind the scenes. I'm
not seeing any strong calls or
any calls at all, really, from
the mayor's office, from the
police board that oversees the
force or from the union, who
often has a lot of negative
things to say about policing
management. So I think for now,
Demko is not taking the fall
for this. He seems to be taking
it relatively seriously. But of
course, the investigation as we
know, is not over. So we're
just waiting to see how that
plays out politically.
>> You mentioned Chief Demko.
Obviously this is a big hit to
public trust. And so I am
curious, what are members of
the public saying? You know, it
wasn't that long ago when there
were calls for defunding the
police. We are talking we are
in the midst of budgets. So,
you know, these are usually
pretty high up there when we
talk about the money allocated
to salaries for police. But
what are the public saying?
>> Yeah, I think like we've
seen such a huge shift in
attitudes toward policing over
the last decade and especially
over the last five years. And I
think it this investigation, I
think, for a lot of people,
validates what they felt was
already happening in terms of
corrupt policing. Now, I don't
think anyone really knew
specifically that this was
going on or could have
predicted this. I certainly
didn't, but I think it's
reinforcing a lot of negative
opinions about policing. And
that's a huge mountain for
Demke and the service as a
whole to overcome. And they
have a lot of work to do to
already repair a fractured
trust in policing.
>> You have been on the crime
beat for for a bit here. I got
to ask, has there been anything
like this in Toronto police
history or in just in the
stories that you have covered
in general? We are just at the
beginning here. Yeah. Have you
seen anything like this?
>> No, I honestly couldn't have
imagined anything like this.
You know, the night that we
were starting to hear the
initial rumours and then were
able to confirm seven officers
accused as part of a massive
York police investigation. It's
just never happened. It's
unprecedented. We're in
unchartered territory, and
we're still waiting to see how
far this goes. I asked chief
Demkiw if he expected more
arrests of his members, and he
said he didn't want to speculate
on what the investigation would
bring. So we're tuning in to
see what happens next.
>> All right. As will we.
Jennifer, thank you very much.
Really appreciate your time.
>> Thank you so much for having
me.
>> Is police corruption rare in
this country and more broadly,
are Canadian institutions
usually seen as trustworthy?
Each year, Transparency
International releases the
Corruption Perceptions Index,
which ranks countries based on
how corrupt their public
sectors are seen to be.
Salvatore Cusumano is the
executive director of
Transparency International
Canada, and he joins us in
studio. How are you doing?
>> Great. Thank you for having
me.
>> Great to have you here.
Let's start off with we're here
to talk corruption. So I think
it's fair that we start the
conversation with corruption
scandal that's taken the
headlines here in Toronto and
broader. But what's your take
on the Toronto police
corruption scandal right now?
>> I mean, I think it shows us
it's a really elegant, if
unfortunate illustration of how
corruption works in Canada. Of
course, the allegations haven't
been proven yet. And anything I
say today, of course, is really
respectful of the due process
that exists and the
investigations that are
continuing. But I think it
shows you that with corruption,
it takes two to tango. What I
mean by that is that on the one
hand, when we talk about
corruption, you do have public
officials who have to be
willing to engage in the
behaviour, people who are going
to use their position of power
or authority to personal,
private or potentially criminal
benefit. On the other hand, you
have just that, which is an
actor or a party that motivates
the corruption in some cases,
maybe coerces the corruption.
And, you know, in this case, we
see, unfortunately, allegations
of public officials serving the
public who may have been tied
up in behaviour by actors who
were looking to exploit a
public institution for some
very nefarious purposes.
>> You use the word elegant.
Help explain that?
>> Well, I think it's elegant
because, you know, at
Transparency International,
we're the Canadian chapter of a
of a global organisation. And
what's elegant is that it's a
really, really clear
illustration. If it's proven of
the vulnerabilities that our
institutions face in Canada. On
the one hand, you know, I think
the investigations hopefully
will point to some of the sort
of systemic tendencies that we
could improve in our
institutions. But on the other
hand, it does show a rising
concern with organised crime in
Canada and the way that
organised crime can, can really
impact the integrity of our
institutions. And so it's
elegant in that sense because
it's come out in public. We're
fortunate to see it. And we do
applaud the investigators who
brought it to light. There's
elegance in that too, that that
we see the impact of the
resources we put into these
types of investigations. But
unfortunately, the downsides
are are evident as well.
>> How corruption in policing
is that, is that rare in Canada?
These are the institutions that
would sort of be investigating
corruption cases on their own.
So we flip that case is is it
rare to see.
>> That's a good question. And
I think that, you know, on the
one hand, I hope that the
investigations that are going
on will tell us, hopefully,
that this is an isolated
incident in the Toronto police
and in Toronto police, Toronto
Area police services. But no,
we've seen cases of of of
corruption in in police
services in Canada. We've also
seen issues of of other types
of misconduct that exist.
Sometimes the two are linked.
But I think the real takeaway
here is that I think there's a
sense sometimes in Canada that
that corruption or the word
corruption refers to something
that happens elsewhere, that it
refers to something that
happens in countries that are
not democratic. I think I think
what we see here is a real
reminder that it is these types
of public institutions that in
this case, are supposed to be
identifying, prosecuting this
type of behaviour. Criminal
organisations are targeting
those, those, those entities as
well, because they need to to
carry out the types of
activities they're doing. These
are vulnerable institutions.
And if we let our foot off the
gas, as these groups become
more sophisticated, this type
of behaviour could become more
common as well. But it does
exist in Canada. It has existed,
and we hope in this case it's
isolated. But we'll have to see
what comes out.
>> All right. Well, let's
switch gears a bit and I want
to zoom out and talk about the
Transparency International's
2025 Corruption Perception
Index for people who aren't
familiar with it. What is it?
What's the methodology?
>> That's a great question. So
the Corruption Perceptions
Index is sort of it's probably
the most discussed index on
corruption in the world right
now. Transparency international
has been doing it for, for for
about 20 years. And what it
basically shows is the
perceptions of experts and
business leaders vis a vis the
perceived levels of corruption
that exist in a country. Now,
when I say perceived, it's not
a direct measure of how many
police scandals took place in
the country. It's it's more a
measure of what is the
confidence and what is the
degree of certainty that people
have about what kind of place
is Canada to do business? What
kind of place is Canada to be a
citizen and to expect
accountability from its
institutions? Now, what we saw
on the rankings this year, 182
countries were ranked. Canada
was 16th from the top. So you
could say 16th best. I think if
we're looking to Milano Cortina
right now, we're not going to
settle for 16th.
>> In hockey.
>> Fair enough. But you know, I
think it shows again, this it's
sort of what you see in the
police scandal is that when I
say 16th, that's a downward
trend, the lowest ranking ever
for Canada since we started the
index. And since we were able
to kind of standardise the
scores in 2012, it could still
be a good score in a global
context. You know, top 10%. But
it's that trend we're worried
about because we think it also
reflects and tracks with
declining public trust in our
institutions and a perception
that that things aren't working
in some way when it comes to to
prosecuting these types of
crimes. And as an aside, you
know, the fact that business
leaders are involved in the
types of indices that feed into
our index, it should be a cause
for concern at a time when
Canada is trying to diversify
its trade and investment
partnerships. You know, if our
country, if our financial
systems are not deemed to be
secure, clean, it does increase
costs for investors in terms of
due diligence, in terms of
checking where their money is
going. And, you know, we really
think on on all aspects public
trust and investor trust.
Frankly, we need to do a much
better job and turn the ship
around.
>> I don't want to make the
same analogy of the Olympics
here, but, you know, it's hard
not to compete or compare
ourselves when we're looking at
this. How do we compare to
other Democratic peers?
>> So one of the interesting
things that came out this year
is we saw a sustained trend of
a similar decline among what
you might call Canada's peer
democracies, countries in the
G7, some of its NATO partners,
and so on. Now, again, on the
one hand, you might be tempted
to say, oh, well, what's
happening here is not that
exceptional. I think when you
think back to, for example,
what our Prime Minister talked
about at the World Economic
Forum, you know, you do see, in
a sense, a threat that exists
across many countries, a
similar trend of declining
public trust that we hope
doesn't signal something deeper
about how democracy in general
is performing. We we believe
that Canada can be a leader in
in this community of countries.
Our prime minister has
certainly said he hopes that we
can be he intends for us to be.
And I think this is one area
where democracies really have
to come together and identify
what is it about our
institutions that is not
keeping the public trust, and
how can we change that?
>> When we look at sort of from
that zoomed out perspective
from from the global side, you
talked about perception versus
actual corruption. Can you give
us some some examples in terms
of what a perception would look
like versus actual? When we
look at maybe down that index,
when we get down to the bottom
half of these countries.
>> Sure. Maybe one thing I can
talk about is the financial
sector in a country. Another
thing I could talk about is the
type of corporate ownership
transparency that exists. And
these two things can can go
hand in hand sometimes. For
example, one of the things that
that we can really see in the
index coming through is what
kind of confidence exists in
who are people doing business
with, and where does money come
from when it's flowing into
Canada, through Canada and out
of Canada? Now the Corruption
Perceptions Index is about
public sector institutions.
That's important to mention.
But these kind of broader
questions around how, how how
well is it known, what
companies are doing business
with the Canadian government or
with the Ontario government,
for example? We are fortunate
at Transparency International
to have been able to work with
government at various levels to
have a registry now of
companies that are registered
at federal level and in a
couple of provinces, who's
behind them, what data exists?
We think that still there could
be room to roll this out across
all provinces, an issue that
you'll see come into public
sector corruption in Canada is
that it is a complicated
environment. You've got
regulations at federal level,
provincial level, even at some,
in some cases municipal level
with these things. And because
Canada's complex people need an
additional level of certainty
sometimes to be able to, to, to
have, have trust. And we
certainly see that in Canada
from a citizens perspective as
well.
>> With that, what steps has
Canada taken to shore up
confidence that our system has
safeguards against corruption?
Obviously there's work to be
done, but what have we done so
far?
>> Sure we have. We have the
fortunate opportunity right now,
a global body that looks at the
integrity of our anti-money
laundering framework in Canada,
the Financial Action Task Force,
they're actually wrapping up a
review right now that's going
to look at how far has Canada
come over the last five and ten
years in, in strengthening a
framework that there had been
some deficiencies identified.
Now Canada has done a couple of
things that we think could be
stronger in practice. One is
opening up that corporate black
box numbered companies at the
federal level. Now they're
they're available for viewing
on a public registry, B.C. and
Quebec as well. Ontario has
announced they're going to do
it as well. You know, this is a
really good opportunity to to
show a body like this, but also
our citizens that you can't
hide behind a numbered company.
You've got to you've got to do
business openly. So we could
see that we hope that will
spread out across Canada. But
it's a good step. Another one
is we just saw Canada announce
the government announced in the
budget 2025 budget, the
creation of a new financial
crimes agency, which might look
into that sort of supply side.
I talked about where you have
organisations trying to corrupt
our institutions. This agency
should theoretically help
improve the coordination
between bodies like RCMP,
provincial level police Fintrac,
the financial intelligence unit.
That's a good step. It's been
named in the budget, but we
would want to know what kind of
resources are behind it. How is
it going to harmonise those
those entities rather than add
another one to the mix? Those
are two things that they have
great potential, but it's kind
of the story. In Canada. We see
good announcements. We have to
really make them effective now.
>> All right. Prime Minister
Carney's government passed the
Building Canada Act to expedite
infrastructure projects deemed
in the nation's interest. When
we see expedite, we think
things are going to speed up
there. There might be some
things that are missing there.
Are there any risks that this
would create opportunity for
corruption?
>> Certainly. I think that we
at Transparency International
Canada know through our
international network that when
you speed up the the way you do
business, the way you make
investments, the way you spend
public money, if at the same
time you're not increasing
transparency and increasing
oversight at a similar rate,
public money is going to be
misspent. We could look at what
happened during Covid, for
example. I think that everybody
knows some of the the public
misspending that took place,
the name Arrivecan, while it
should have been a source of
pride for something that
secured our country and
improved our public health,
it's now become an infamous
name in terms of how our money
is, is, is spent that that
incident could be multiplied
many, many times over. If we
don't manage this critical
moment the right way. And so
when we see the creation of
things like, for example, a new
Defence investment agency, you
know, that can be a very good
way of helping improve our
country's defence. But we need
to make sure that when when you
do create these kind of
channels, that there is an
opportunity to, to to be open
with the public as much as you
can with something as sensitive
as defence about where the
money is being spent, that it's
being spent competitively, and
that it is actually, at the end
of the day, improving our
defence. Because that's the
bottom line. If we spend money
and it doesn't improve our
defence, that will undermine
public trust. Same goes with
infrastructure and many other
priorities.
>> Very quickly. When we're
talking about Canada, it's hard
not to have a conversation
about the US as well. To some,
the US has been the world's
policeman to some extent. How
have they been doing at
policing corruption under this
administration?
>> Well, they've announced the
rollback of certain of the
enforcement of certain laws
that were instrumental in
bringing people to justice,
both in the US and abroad. Now,
I think what we'll see, it's
still early to tell, if you can
imagine a year in, we have seen
so much. But on this front, I
think it's still early to tell
where it will go. It's again a
reminder that these things can
be weaponized. It's a reminder
that you don't want to make
yourself a target. We need to
be impeccable on all of these
things. It's not just the
potential of rolling back
enforcement, it's the potential
of using it in ways that suit
pretexts. We have seen this
administration use, you know,
the justification of, of of
fentanyl flowing across the
border into the US as a reason
to apply tariffs. It's just a
call to say whatever is
happening south of us, there
are so many things we can do to
get better. Let's not give
anyone a reason to to point the
finger.
>> All right. We're going to
leave it there. I really
appreciate your insights. Thank
you so much.
>> Appreciate your time. Thank
you so much.
