I grew up in a family
of small business owners in Argentina.
My parents ran a curtain and carpet shop,
so I witnessed first-hand
how difficult it is to grow a business.
Trust and support from their community
were key in keeping the business alive.
But I decided not to continue
with my family business.
Instead, I studied political science.
I was obsessed with how technology
could support the growth
of businesses like my parents'.
And that curiosity led me to MIT,
where in 2019,
my Master’s thesis in AI
and economic development
got awarded funding
to become a real-world pilot.
And that's how I ended up working
in informal settlements in Colombia.
In these neighborhoods
where I did my research,
you didn't need a credit
card to buy lunch.
It was enough for the shopkeeper
to know who you were.
If your mother had a good
record with loans,
if you said hello in the mornings,
if you had a shop
that was known by the neighbors,
they will front you the rice,
the sugarcane, the bread.
The economy didn't run solely on cash.
It ran on trust.
That invisible currency
that is built over time.
And I noticed something.
Those same principles
I saw growing up in Argentina
were alive in Colombian businesses, too.
In many Latin American neighborhoods,
trust has always been
the strongest currency.
A good name.
But here comes the contradiction.
When this same person goes to a bank
and asks for a loan to grow this business,
they will be rejected.
They will tell them,
“You don’t have a collateral.
You don't have a financial history.
There's no way we can prove who you are."
In many Latin American
neighborhoods, this is the case.
And in Latin America,
half of our population
is excluded from formal credit.
After a decade working
at the intersection of financial inclusion
and urban development,
I dedicated my life
to answer one question.
What if what makes you credit-worthy
in your neighborhood,
trust,
could also make you credit-worthy
in the eyes of a bank?
What if your word could be part
of the risk assessment?
What if we can scale the access to capital
by making your potential measurable?
What if trust could be measured with AI?
So before I tell you more,
I want to share a little bit
of how all this started.
Since I was a child,
I dreamed of changing the world.
And that's why I studied
political science.
I thought I was going
to do it through policy.
But then I realized policy was not moving
at the speed people needed to.
So I turned to technology.
Technology doesn't recognize
any geographic boundary.
So at MIT,
my classmates and I
started working on a local project
to define local marketplaces
for communities,
platforms where they can upload
what they are selling
and become visible in their community.
We started visiting these businesses
to help them to upload
more pictures of their products
into the marketplace
and become known and start selling more.
And we noticed that they weren't
growing their sales.
So when we asked them why,
their answer was very simple.
They didn't have enough money
to buy more supplies.
Even though they were running
these businesses for years,
they couldn't get more inventory.
They couldn't get any access
to working capital to buy more inventory.
So we noticed something.
We were not facing a visibility problem.
We were facing a financial
exclusion problem.
And the deeper I went,
the more I learned something
that we usually don't say enough.
Being poor is very expensive.
Products cost more
when you can just afford them
in small quantities.
If you can't buy
a whole bottle of shampoo,
you end up buying a sachet.
If you can't buy groceries
for the whole week,
you end up buying by the day,
and you always end up paying more.
And when it comes to credit,
in the financial sector,
the cost is even higher.
When you don't have
a credit history or bank account,
your only option is to access
the predatory lenders.
The "gota-a-gota", the loan sharks,
and they come at brutal cost.
They don't ask you for paperwork,
but they could charge you
20-percent interest rate per week,
even per day,
and they are violent and abusive.
So I will tell you the story of Maria.
She's a Venezuelan migrant
living in a low-income
neighborhood in Colombia.
She makes these
beautiful handcrafted bags,
and she gets custom
orders from her clients.
So before she sells and she gets paid,
she needs to make the order.
So she needs to buy the materials
to make that order happen.
As Maria is a migrant,
she doesn't have a bank account,
she doesn't have any credit history,
so her only option to buy those materials
is to ask for money
from these predatory lenders
that are really, really dangerous.
Unfortunately, Maria
in Latin America is not the exception.
She's actually the rule.
She's the rule in Latin America.
Millions of microbusinesses.
Microbusinesses like hers are everywhere.
They are from the corner shop
to the restaurant to the beauty salon.
Actually, almost every business
in Latin America is a microbusiness.
Ninety-nine percent
of our businesses are micro,
and they contribute one third of our GDP.
But still, they cannot even access
one dollar from a bank.
Why? Because they don't have the paperwork
the financial system was built to require.
So Maria might not have a credit history,
she might not have a bank account,
but she has a phone.
And there's where we saw the opportunity.
Not to change who they are,
but to change how they are seen.
So when we started,
there was no data about this economy
and this segment of the population
we wanted to help.
And, you know, that's one
of the main problems with AI.
Models can only predict
what they have already seen.
So we understood
that if we wanted
to start helping this population,
we needed to build a data set ourselves.
As this population we're talking about
are informal entrepreneurs,
then there's no record, there's no data.
So you become invisible to the system.
So in traditional banking,
the way they give out a loan is usually,
you know, the risk officer goes
to the house of the person,
checks the business with their own eyes,
talks with the neighbors,
sees if actually that business exists
and they make the decision
based on their experience
that usually comes with bias,
it’s subjective, and it’s really slow.
So at that point, when we started
to build the data set,
we were actually building
the local marketplaces
where people were uploading
the products of what they were selling.
And we noticed that the images themselves
were full of economic signals.
We could see if there were
customers in the back,
if the product was handmade,
if there was potential
for that product or service
to be sold in that neighborhood.
So the data was there,
but just not in the format
that the banks were trained to read.
So when we started building
the data set, we started small.
Super small.
We started giving out 10-dollar loans,
just enough for entrepreneurs
to refill their inventory
and enough for us
to start growing the data set.
And we were very intentional
to whom we were giving the loans.
Half of the people
we were serving were women,
because if we want AI to be fair,
then it needs to learn from everyone.
So people like Maria the artisan,
they might not have a credit history,
but she has a phone that is full
of clues about her daily economy.
She has a Facebook page
where she uploads
the products she's selling,
She has, you know,
text orders that she's receiving.
She has had this phone for years,
she has videos
of the products in her phone.
So we built a suite of scores,
AI-powered models,
that take these invisible data
into a financial identity.
This is all the data we are processing.
But I will concentrate
on three specific scores
that are proprietary
and that have been done by us.
One of the main scores we have
is looking at text messages,
short-code text messages,
where we are getting
bill payments, order confirmations,
mobile recharges,
any transactions that have been done
in digital wallets or bank accounts.
And by using an LLM model
and machine learning,
we can detect patterns
of income, of spending,
of disposable, available
balance per month.
It's a kind of open banking,
but instead of using a bank account,
we are using telecom data.
Another score we have developed
is using videos.
We replace that visit
that usually the risk officer
is doing to the houses of people,
that is usually very expensive
and it takes a lot of time.
We replace it by users sending
a one-minute video of their business,
where they explain what they are doing,
and using computer vision,
we can get their stock,
their inventory, their tone of voice,
what they are saying about their business,
their localization, the type of business,
and all the potential that it has.
We are detecting their willingness to pay.
And lastly, we developed one
that is connecting
into their social media.
Right now, most of businesses,
even if they are informal,
they are present online.
They have a Facebook page
or they have an Instagram.
So when they apply for the loan,
they sign up into their social media
and we can get their videos,
their pictures,
So we use, again, computer vision,
the same one we did
for the other type of videos.
But also we get the likes, the comments,
the engagement they are having,
their profile bio,
and we detected that a business
that has a really strong
social presence and online presence
has more probability to pay back.
So all this data flows into our models
and we detect patterns and signals
that can tell us
can this person be trusted with a loan
if they never had one before?
And after three years,
we can go beyond just saying yes or no.
That in fact, we do it in just seconds.
We can also say how much they can repay,
when and under what conditions.
This is allowing us to simulate
the interest rate,
the number of installments,
we can also detect for seasonal impact.
So this is allowing us to offer credit
that is actually supporting
people's everyday needs
and that are tailor-made for them.
It's not just one financial product
that we are trying to sell to everyone.
It's actually understanding
what do you need for your business.
So we have validated this approach.
After all these three years,
we demonstrated that we can use
this type of data
to understand the informal sector.
Our business and our models
have reached an accuracy levels
on top of 0.83,
which is at market standards.
We have served more
than 26,000 entrepreneurs.
Our models have been trained
with more than 150,000 data samples
of informal entrepreneurs
with millions of data points.
But it is not just supporting
the entrepreneur and their family.
This is changing the financial system.
What usually took years to be built,
or maybe we don't have it at all,
a credit history,
now can take just months.
We are building a live financial monitor
of the financial well-being
that can be updated daily,
so you don't need to wait years
to be eligible for a loan.
And this is allowing the informal sector
to access loans
from the formal banking system
for the first time.
Artificial intelligence is not magic.
It's a tool.
One that can help us process
millions of data points
no human risk officer
could ever reach, could ever read,
watch or analyze at scale.
AI, of course, is improving efficiency.
But if we design it with intention,
it becomes more than efficient.
It becomes fair,
and it allows us to see value
where others were seeing risk.
It's allowing us to see gold
where others saw stones,
and it's allowing us
to offer services at scale,
while at the same time
honoring the local knowledge,
culture and context.
It’s allowing us the hyper-personalization
of financial services.
And to say yes to someone like Maria.
To say yes to someone like my mom
all those years ago
when she started the business.
And to millions of women entrepreneurs
that we are pushing this economy forward.
You say yes, not because
of a bank statement,
but because of millions of quiet signals
that tell us that she shows up,
she delivers,
and she can be trusted.
(Applause)
