Last time I interviewed the Chinese man who is fighting for the Russian army in the Russian-Russian war. Let's talk about his situation first. He was bombed on the way to transport the wounded. He died of a minor injury. He is currently in the hospital in the back. His contract will expire in May. 上期節目播出之後,馬卡龍告訴我國內有警察聯繫了他,表達了試圖幫助的意願。馬卡龍在訓練營時期就希望能夠退出,但是沒能實現,所以之後的參戰違背他的個人意願。中國政府不鼓勵公民去雙方戰場參戰,不過很多人都希望政府能夠出於人道主義考慮,在馬卡龍退役和回國期間提供必要的幫助,我們也會繼續關注他的命運。 另外上期節目播出之後我收到了很多關於烏克蘭的中國人的線索之前我從媒體了解到的是烏克蘭的國際軍團當中唯一一位公開身份的中國公民叫彭晨亮他在2024年的11月份已經陣亡但目前我能核實身份的在烏軍一線作戰的中國公民不只一位他們的理念和經歷也不同 我會盡可能在這些節目當中無時的呈現他們的聲音這是我的槍這是我的防彈衣那邊是別的戰友然後那邊是我們隊友其他的人我目前能夠接觸到的最早去往烏克蘭作戰的中國公民叫高山他曾經在法國外籍軍團偵察聯服役在2022年夏天帶著自己的機槍到了烏克蘭 有的美國人會過來跑過來問我誒 但是你們中國不是支持俄斯嗎?對 你怎麼回答呢?俄斯囤了很多中國的領土啊 從歷史上近百年就蒙古啊 比如海神馬啊後來中國說為了邦交嘛 就是不追憂了但是事還是存在的嘛讓它如法保之 又去侵略別的國家 那可能當年這個烏克蘭也是德國的一個部分 對吧進入戰爭當中它也有份有份有份 但是這個地盤最後歸誰了是歸烏克蘭了嗎 沒有官方對於中俄關係友好的這種強調是非常的普遍和頻繁的嗎那你是帶著飛機攻擊去烏克蘭戰場你不覺得這當中有一種反差幸好官方也沒有太真的支持 這什麼事也不能改變我是個中國人的這件事高山在他的機槍上,貼著中國國旗我接觸的另外一位正在烏軍服役的中國公民也在胸前佩戴著國旗他此刻正在110旅無人機系統營服役這位叫做天下未功的下士,同樣自稱愛國者但強調他參戰與中國歷史無關 说爱就是爱,和丝绸没有关系。我问到具体的动机,他发了一段视频给我。这段视频是天下卫工参战的原因。2024年7月份,他在新闻中看到,俄罗斯两枚导弹击中了肌腹的儿童肿瘤医院,导致很多孩子和医生护士的死亡。 此后,他决定到乌克兰,用自己的工程师经验服务于他们的无人机部队。他认为自己胸前佩戴国旗,是象征中国人的人道主义。与前两位不同,在2024年7月份,加入乌克兰国际军团的中国籍士兵彭晨亮在当年11月4日执行步兵任务时阵亡。 他是云南红河人,但在预录的遗嘱中,他要求批中华民国国旗。在这里也立个遗嘱吧,如果哪一天我有不测,请把我的照片和我的国旗放在圣光的旁边。曾圣光是台湾人,也是乌克兰战场上阵亡的第一位东亚军人。彭承亮是他为偶像,他手中所持的旗就是曾圣光带来战场的。 蓬佩奧說過,他的選擇和經歷有關。2023年7月29日,他因為尋釁滋事罪在雲南被逮捕。作案工具是一台灰色手機。按有事,他發了64條推特。其中一條,是諷刺網絡尋釁滋事犯罪。 彭程亮在推特中表达了对于云南当地警察执法方式的不满,也批评了一些政治人物,包括普京。公安在提醒我的时候说过,那普京是不允许的,是违反的。因为我在推特上去转号就说了一句,畜生普京,我当时发的是。他对小姐定为那个我犯罪的证据吗?畜生普京。从他的推特来看,涉及到普京的应该是这一条。这是彭程亮看到了乌克兰的抽烟士兵被处决的新闻之后发表的评论。 他的战友整理他的遗物的时候,找到了判决书,发了部分截图给我。法庭认为,彭程亮在境外平台辱骂他人,严重损害党和国家,在国际上的地位和形象,危及国家利益和社会秩序。 彭哲亮的推特基本上没有任何转发和评论,但判决认定他造成了恶劣的社会影响。彭哲亮被羁押半年之后,律师建议他做一个精神兵鉴定,争取早日出狱。 此后,他按照羁押的日期被判了7个月。2024年2月25日,刑满处狱之后,彭程亮持护照尝试出境,未受到限制,在4月份进入乌克兰。当年7月,他拿中国护照进入乌克兰国际军团无人机部队。 好吧,这就是我想说的中华人民共和国部长对当时彭成亮是唯一一个公开身份为乌克兰而战的中国公民我们为的是自由而战,为的是民主而战彭成亮、高山、天下卫工这三位为乌克兰作战的士兵动机不同政治理念也有差异但有一点高度相似他们都强烈拒绝雇佣兵的说法而认为自己是志愿兵 高山在海外大马公司工作,天下围攻是前工程师,而彭晨亮之前是无人机老师,他们都认为经济因素不是他们参战的主要动机。这也是彭晨亮的台湾队友文洋接受采访的原因之一,他不能忍受朋友被称为雇佣兵。 You guys can talk like this. 我弟兄的死就毫無意義,毫無價值了所以你有一種憤怒當然是有憤怒啊我認識的這些人他們像阿達他在台灣做工作台幣一個月可以賺六七萬我現在還算比較富裕的家庭我缺錢嗎?我不缺錢 那量載缺錢嗎?我也不覺得他缺錢。不缺錢的人到那個地方,你就不要說我們是為了什麼錢而來,那就是各自的信念問題。我並不認為想去烏克蘭參戰的中國人都是理想主義者。在任何一場戰爭中,都不會缺乏想要掙錢、想要投機,或者想要體驗戰爭的人。只不過,他們抵達雙方戰場的難易程度有相當的不同。 我们可以拿马卡龙和鹏城亮的经历来做一个简单的对比在一线战斗的月工资,马卡龙是15000左右,鹏城亮是25000左右马卡龙持旅行签证到俄罗斯,鹏城亮是从波兰去乌克兰需要生根签证和购买保险 入伍的程序审核,马卡龙没有。而彭真亮需要四个部门审核,时长大约两个月,并且有英文要求。马卡龙的《俄罗斯战场》内容可以在国内的社交媒体发布,而彭真亮以及我采访的其他乌克兰军中的中国公民均在国内的社交媒体隐匿身份。 These conditions can be seen from the comparison. The reality of going to the war in Ukraine is more difficult. And they are wearing their own equipment. Foreign soldiers are wearing their own equipment to fight. This is common on the battlefields of both Russian and Russian troops. Look at the Russian troops. This is too hard. This is too hard. I feel much better. This helmet looks like a fool. It looks like a Taliban. I will look like a US soldier with my own. This is the equipment that the Russian troops got from the Macaron. Good stuff. 两块防弹插板纯铁板刚从上面拔下来的就他们有点沉了不错马卡龙和彭真亮的公司都用来买了装备区别是彭真亮用上了而马卡龙没有 The Russian army seized his equipment. After he complained to the commander, he was locked in the dungeon. After that, the army arranged him to be in front of the assault team. He was wearing a gun that was sent to him in 1948, and two rusty iron I was lucky, I didn't explode, and then I got shot twice. It's okay, I was lucky, and then I went into the small forest and the UAV came again. I got a lot of bombs, and I realized that because the plain was full of eggshells and corpses, I realized that I couldn't go any further. I had to go forward and die. You are attacking Ukraine from a flat line. You are going to be in the air. No mater how you move, you use your flying or climbing skills, people can see you. So you must have enough troops, at least twice or three times more. And then try to attack the next point. Then there is no doubt that your damage will be high. This is not a war in your country. But then, first, you have a life-and-death battle. Secondly, the group of people you are facing do not have personal grudges against you. Will you struggle? In this war, Russia is the main enemy. As the main enemy, you have to be beaten up. It's that simple. If you want to beat someone up, you have to be beaten up. That's why so many people died. Last night, a strong attack hit the ground. Both sides suffered heavy losses. 有些细节我没法描述,很血腥 Russia has a lot of people, it has 2 million people, Ukraine has only a few hundred thousand people. Can it be the same? And we have the advantage of the air, the advantage of the cannon, and the advantage of the number of people. The opposite is... 无人机很多对 但是无人机它只能骚扰和防守实际作用它有效减缓了俄罗斯军队进攻的速度你看巴赫姆特打了一年巴赫姆特的第二个城市叫苏菲尔现在马上一年了你说打一个城市也就间隔十几公里打一个小城市要打一年而且要伤亡好几万人三万人左右伤亡不全是死亡 这代价也挺大的其实这是为什么俄军宣告攻占巴赫木特一年多之后马卡龙还在这里因为乌克兰人不肯放弃这个城市彭辰亮阵亡的地方就在距离巴赫木特十几公里之外这个是杰西比尔 When the Reds went, the whole city was under our control on October 1, 2024. Later, the Reds attacked Russia. The Reds' arrows gradually lost their position. 俄罗斯就用那种人浪冲锋人海战术不惜命的往前推这个地方离13公里就是那个巴克姆特就是马卡龙在的阵地马卡龙所说的俄军花了极大代价争夺的城市就是恰西富亚尔2022年高山在这里防守2024年彭程亮和潘文洋还在这里防守 馬卡龍在聊的時候 感覺整個俄軍的指揮系統包括裝備都很糟糕 他的槍是很爛 很糟糕 但是這個槍是沒有太大用處其實我們那個首領的地方大概一個月也沒有交火一兩次但是每天都會有炮擊和無人機 When the bomb falls, it will explode in front of you. You will see a black object. It's like a ball, but it's very fast. Then it goes down. Then there will be a very big fire. The flame will directly cut the fallen leaves on the ground. It's about seven or eight meters high. Then it's... When the bomb is falling, it will make a very sharp sound. A very sharp sound. If it flies over your head, it will fly over you like this. But when it's about to blow you up, it has a very sharp sound. When you hear it, you basically know you've been targeted. What was your reaction? The situation was that the island was being occupied. If you were to look for trees or the land where the land had been spread, you would have a chance to survive in such an environment. If you were to land on flat land, and you encountered such dense gunfire, you would die from the gunfire. 從軍事實力看,俄羅斯在全球的排名第二,而烏克蘭排在第二十名之後。戰爭開始之前,俄羅斯有現役軍人90萬,烏克蘭20萬。俄羅斯有預備役軍人200萬,烏克蘭90萬。 就比如這個電子偵查車他們是還有這個火炮的水平都是比較高於這個武漢的我們這邊這個偵查車就很少他們無人機啊什麼什麼或者那邊信號就我們這邊就很難捕捉 外界得到的印象是西方國家的軍事援助也好或者情報也好是烏克蘭一個持續的動力而俄羅斯這邊在被消耗挺厲害的俄羅斯的鋼鐵紅油但是巴士上的傷亡都是由炮擊和火機造成的我的台灣戰友犧牲了他叫什麼名字 就是曾胜光哦 就是曾胜光就是台湾阵亡的那个士兵我们两个人就在挨着床我们天天吃喝喝 躲在一块儿这是25岁的台湾士兵曾胜光试图在开一辆战场上搅和的俄国坦克看起来 这辆坦克是苏联时期的T-62 俄勳坦克在战场上损失严重,就将不少不存武器翻新之后重新投入战争。但他们仍可以造成致命伤害。曾胜光有五年在台湾陆军服役的经验。他写:老实说,我没有把握每次都能那么幸运。晚上睡觉睡到一半,听到炮声都会怕,永远都不知道下一刻会不会直接打在你呆的房子。 兩三公里上去發現對面的熱衝向目標然後進行一個迅速的炮擊比如一分鐘打六到八發然後盛光就這麼死的這種事也經常發生嘛因為我們都不知道炮來哪打來的 所以即使是像你這樣 在多個戰爭區域已經有過作戰經驗的人 在這樣的戰場上其實也是……我也都是炮灰 步兵都沒有意義我們唯一的意義就是 我幫我們西城叫天坑這個坑的概念是1000多公里的戰線都是由雙方的坑道和空勢組成的 我們就是填其中的幾百米的一個坑填完之後 如果對方進攻呢我們要麼報到 要麼去阻攔我們阻攔不了 我們就撤退這就是填坑的一個原理你們雙方都認為步兵在這麼個戰場當中幾乎是非常殘酷的就是被 像炮灰一樣被犧牲的角色 就是為什麼還要這麼去銷售?因為這個戰線一千多公里必須有人去守著呀你沒人守他就攻過來就形成一個包圍了就把其他地方也影響掉了我採訪雙方戰士的時候他們都自稱炮灰區別在於選擇,馬卡龍沒有選擇 他从训练营时期想要离开,就被告知他的合同将被自动续约,一直到战争胜利为止。此后,他被强制送进了突击队。他想要脱离的时候,一位翻译告诉他,可以通过行贿离开,骗走了他5万人民币。 I have to tell you that this is not the place for those who want to make money or experience. There is no retreat. Go to the team and attack the team. 好 I know that going directly to the assault team's base and even facing death is a very dangerous thing. I even have to kowtow to my parents and say that I was wrong. But I have to say that only this kind of action can be used to completely realize my so-called ideas. There is a hamburger shop near our shelter. It's a kind of small stall. There are a few stores that sell snacks or hot dogs. It was the people who were suffering. The people who didn't do this, they couldn't maintain their spirit. They used two rockets to blow up that place. They blew up. The people died. What was the point?  We have a lot of people here in the class, especially those who study politics, we need to talk about justice and peace. You go to the front line and talk to the devil. If we want to talk, we need to have some people. They can really pick up their weapons and go to the front line. Even if you don't attack, at least you can defend that place. Don't let him push forward again. On October 15, 2024, the second battalion where Wen Yang was located decided to counterattack in Chachifu-Yar. At this time, Peng Cheng-lai asked to fall back and fight with Wen Yang. This meant that he would turn from a drone to a assault team. 同樣在無人機部隊服役的天下圍攻,發給了我這些視頻。他告訴我,這是他為什麼尊敬彭志亮的原因,因為無人機的匪首最清楚步兵是何等脆弱。 I immediately called him because they are my family. I can understand that I go to war with my family, it's more fun than going to war with a group of friends. That makes me feel more at ease. He wanted to come to my team. He wanted to form a Chinese team with me and Ada. Because he thought it was a bright spot. In Ukraine, we are all foreigners. 在一国作战,语言是双方士兵最大的障碍。马卡龙告诉我,他是俄军联队当中唯一的外国士兵,所以只能够依靠手机翻译软件来跟他的上级和同僚沟通。这也是为什么他被关进地牢之后,俄方仍然允许他使用手机。我问他为什么不申请调动到一个可以讲中文或者讲英文的地方。 他說沒人會在乎一個士兵尤其是一個外國士兵他們怕這個外國士兵滑變或者逃跑吧或者是這個出賣情報吧咱也不知道他們是怎麼想的在大陸長大的高山在軍團最親密的戰友來自一位台灣的原住民曾勝國 在你去烏克蘭之前 你曾經想像過說你跟一個……沒有 不可能 怎麼會想像不到我也帶了中國國旗 他也帶了那個青年白日旗你們各自怎麼處理的?我那戶家展示的 她掛床頭了你呢? 我收起來了為什麼你收起來了你沒有用一種對峙的方式呢嗯我首先我那個旗標小我在那邊沒它那個大它那個真大你是覺得就是掛出來這個聲威不夠是吧對 我印象最深的一個 我跟那個聖光有一個片段就是在佩羅西訪問台灣的時候我們倆正在站好一朵防空警報然後我到時候我再問他 我說 曾曾你看新聞了嗎 佩羅西再過一個小時就降落台灣了 我說你說這兩邊會不會打起來啊 都是中國人合併的那他的態度呢 也是 他說也不希望打起來但是一旦打起來呢 他肯定要回台灣那我說一旦打起來呢 我也肯定要回中國那個場景的討論影響到你們之間的感情嗎不影響 不影響 我們那時候吃的還不太好我們那時候我們還去研究 怎麼樣出去搞點吃的高山和曾勝光在戰壕裡 做了兩碗麵加了一點辣醬 兩個人分著吃了高山把他帶的筷子也分送了幾位日本戰友他說他不喜歡日本人在戰場時 曾經拒絕傳日本捐贈的軍服 但是,他说和在法外达过的所有战争相比,额巫战争的残酷性是空前的。他也产生了同样强度的凝聚力。一些流浪狗经常和他们一起躲炮弹,在列队的时候,士兵会给狗在队伍中留出位置。这是高山派的一张照片。在战壕中,他搭了一个雨棚,和曾胜光一起躲雨。 就是这么一个瞬间,让我想起上期节目当中的一个细节马哈龙在勒军大战的时候,总是一个人坐在黑暗中听着枪炮声,偶尔跟老鼠说话战争的恐怖和人性的需求是一样的区别在于在生死的边缘,有没有人可以信任,有没有人可以依靠 甚至死亡的时候,有没有人可以告别?2002年秋天,父亲去世,高山返回中国。但不久之后,他知道曾胜光陈亡的消息,重返乌克兰。我第二次带了很多东西,带了很多装备给他们,去捐给他们。 I went to talk to her about the idea of the light. What did you say to her? We talked about the last conversation. He said... He was very tired and cold every day. He didn't have much equipment. After that incident, he died in a second. Zeng Shengguang was the first Chinese soldier to die in the East Asia. Wu Kalan held a funeral for him and his family. Heng Zhiliang didn't know him. But he tweeted the news of Zeng Shengguang's death. He said, "Brother, good luck." 錄製自己的視頻一組時,彭聲亮手持的,就是曾聲光床頭那面旗幟。他請求調去突擊隊的時候,對文陽說,不論做什麼,副射手、精確射手、不相守,都可以。這意味著,他只是想跟自己的朋友生死與共。 This application was approved. And then? He had to complete the mission first, before he could be transferred. Then he died in the mission he completed. After hearing that, I was actually quite sad. Because if I didn't invite him to the second camp, would he survive? He was a drone operator, but he said, "Don't worry, I know your machine gun is heavy, so I'll carry bullets for you." Have you ever thought about having such a deep relationship with a young man in the mainland? My relationship is actually very special. When he was in Lvov, I said, "If you have time, come to my house and I'll make you dumplings." What was that feeling? You would think of food in Ukraine, all white people's food. You would suddenly think of the dumplings your mom made for you. There's a kind of love affair. So they're my brothers over there. They're my family. 現在兩岸的這種形勢下,好像有的時候大家談起一些理念也會有對峙的感覺政治不是我們決定的,政治是由領袖決定的領袖決定怎麼做,下面的人才會有衝突領袖只要不要鬧,我們大家都是好朋友 彭志亮在调离之后仍然要出任务,是因为前线的形势突然发生了变化。从地图上可以看得出来,这个红区是俄战区,英勇区是双方交战区。10月份,俄方一直在快速推进。到10月21日左右,红色的方块出现了。 This means that the Russian army is behind the enemy. In this case, someone must be the closest to the enemy. Peng's team member told me that he was in the front line of the fire zone where he was performing the observation mission. Only a 22-year-old British teammate was with him, who was also a drone pilot. 這是一個自願任務,彭志亮可以選擇不去。他曾反復斟酌,對朋友阿提說,理性告訴他不要去,但他最終去了。我知道他去之前其實也挺掙扎的。他非常掙扎,因為他們說在國際軍團的死亡率,我必須講,高達30%,那是很高的一件事。 I would say, you have read books, Liang Liang has read books. Someone is braver than him. I don't believe it. On October 27, Peng Chengliang set off. His team member provided me with this observation chart. I checked this chart. From the map, it was written here, "The 9th Independent Motorized Rifleman of the Russian Army." It belongs to the mechanical army of the Russian front line. 他的最前沿,执行观测任务。这是与敌人接触最频繁的地方。他的队友告诉我,这个位置相对孤立,如果与敌人发生接触,可能没有人能够支援他们。横贞亮实现了他初到乌克兰时许下的诺言。  最好在那里,确实。圣光兄弟是最好的,曾圣光战士是最好的,他已经把生命打在了这里,我们只是一个普通人,我们不要想成为任何英雄,我只想默默地去把事情做好就行了。任务只有四天,但是就在这四天之内,前线的俄军活动频繁,撤离变得危险了,任务只能延长。 在乌克兰的冬天,彭程亮和他的队友两个人在前沿阵地住宅了九天。在那里,他度过了自己30岁的生日。 待兩天三天四天哪怕待四個小時以上基本上就凍透了你沒有熱源哪怕你吃飽了沒有熱源就沒有拋火的東西啊會非常難受外面99的世界都是非常枯燥的這些換班一個人兩個小時一個人四個小時去掩體的一個小眼那去去盯著對面盯著中間的一個緩衝帶 有一天晚上我們那個電池動得沒電了沒有熱成像了結果所有人都沒有睡覺所有人睜大雙眼數起耳朵熬了一晚上彭志亮當時的處境遠比高山所描述的更差他的隊友告訴我 彭丞亮執行監測任務的時候,沒有夜市儀,也沒有熱城巷儀。因為戰局變化,他所在的這個聯隊,負責區域的前線觀察哨突然從2個點增加到了6個點,裝備不足。這意味著,在夜裡,他們沒有防禦可言。 10月29日,文洋问候彭成亮,没有回应。此时,文洋所在的突击队的反攻,马上就要开始。两天之后,他和朋友吴忠达的小队,负重数十公斤,进入森林。突击开始之前十分钟。吴忠达告诉文洋: If he dies, he will give his bullet armor to his teammates. This is his last words. The first shell of Russian troops fell down. It was two meters away from Panwenyang. He could feel the wind when he was close. He could hardly hear anything after that. Only sharp ears remained. What was your feeling at that time? The first thing I did at that time was to pat my thighs, my calves and my shoulders. Because I knew that Some people were injured or lost their limbs, and they might not have noticed. I made sure I was fine, and my teammate had a problem. The bomb was in the middle of us. The bomb flew in front of us, and there was a big piece of the bomb, a Pugipug bomb, and it flew right past me. If I had been a little bit later, I would have died. 但是他就沒有那麼幸運,最後那個迫擊炮彈便打到他的嘴巴,所以他的嘴唇就被掀開了。高山告訴過我,一旦炮擊開始,俄軍會通知附近幾十公里的部隊不自殺武林級,行程包圍,撤離即困難。但我楊知道,交戰區的後方有一個埋過大型車輛的壕溝。 他拉著受傷的隊長和隊員向那裡撤退。就在這個時候,他幾乎是用讀純語的方式,看到吳仲達對他說:「我不能動。」我們隊長那時候想要去拉他,但一拉的時候,他的防彈背心下面,腰部那個位置,傷口就撕裂嘛,非常大非常大。這麼大一個洞,你可想得知那個血會怎麼滲出來。所以那時候隊長講,我說:「我想幫他,我也無奈。」 Even if I helped him, I would drag him 20 or 30 meters, and he would die. Because that kind of open wound is not possible. At that time, when the bomb exploded, it was all ashes, and the leaves scattered in a mess. The smoke was buried, you couldn't see anything, we could only retreat. And I was a sniper, so I had to hold that... I had to carry a heavy machine gun with me every time I pressed two or four buttons. I had to cover my wounded teammates. Because we didn't run 10 meters, a bomb would fall. It was 2 or 3 meters away from us. So at that stage, my mind was completely empty. I was retreating into the forest. Then I started to have a little consciousness. In the escape, I was completely blank. You mean you didn't have the impression that you saw him after he was bombed? I only saw that there was nothing there. Really. On November 1st, Wu Zhongda, the father of these three children, died. 文洋所在的突击队20人死亡,10人重伤。三天之后,彭晨亮的无线电台电池在完全耗尽前,接到了撤离命令。潘文洋说,彭晨亮没有热成像仪,也没有夜视镜,晚上撤退根本不可能,因为前线太黑,会成为敌军的伙伴子。 但是白天撤退,意味着完全暴露在敌人之下。曾经有类似经历的马卡龙,向我介绍过这种危险。大白天的时候我们往前去走刚到这公路上就挨炸就挨对就被袭击我感觉这太愚蠢了就是在敌人的不是在眼皮子底下就是在敌人的眼睛里边 敌人就是打名牌就告诉你我要去打你就这样你知道吧通过坐标在军事地图上我们可以大概还原当天彭志亮撤离的路线就是在这个十字路口他和队友被四名俄军复击数十米的距离内进行火力覆盖命中几率非常高文阳对我说在这种敌火直下撤离必须要有火力掩护确保敌军无法攻击否则就是自杀和赌运气 I asked my friend Zhen Liang's teammates for help. He told me that there was no fire support that day. To be honest, our military equipment is not that good. We don't have any armored vehicles, tanks, or helicopters. We are a unit of infantry. So we don't have any fire support. That's all a dream. Why is there no fire support? I don't know the specific situation. I have confirmed to the soldiers of the WU Army and the international troops that the international troops lack heavy weapons and armored vehicles. The world's military officer who served in the Ukrainian army told me that his troops, whether in equipment or rear-line, were quite good. But the international group is completely different. Gao Shan explained to me that tanks and cannons need long-term training and integration, and that they need to master the local language and need long-term training. 可是國際兵團的流動性很大通常只有6個月的合同而且沒有強制約束力有的人會離開就是說逃兵就是放棄離開大家得很快能理解那你這個合同上面簽署的這些日期什麼的它怎麼執行沒有具體日期 就是一个进入,只要你什么离开都可以。我下一出事之后,我上午知道这个信息,我转天上午就走了。乌克兰国际军团高流动性的结果,彭志亮很了解。他曾经在推特上转发过波兰装甲部队的视频,说:"作为轻步兵的我们哭死,希望军团能够拥有装甲单位。"所以,北俄军伏击的时候,他很清楚不会有炮火之源,他只能自己持枪而战。 当年发生了浇火,彭直亮的枪是AK-74U,有30发子弹。按照文洋的经验,他应该浇火拖延时间,呼叫友军支援。从地图看,这个十字路口距离最近的友军据点大约40米。 But Peng's team confirmed to me that no one rescued them that day. I have to say that the command is quite confusing in the international All of them spoke English, but we entered a L-shaped death zone. Under this circumstance, if you want to call for the support of the army, the rest of the troops and soldiers mostly spoke Spanish. Who would speak Spanish? So the command chain created this language barrier, and linked it to the so-called life-threatening. So this is why I chose to leave. For them, I'm sorry to say those two words, but in fact, it was treated like this. You mean the two words "Huahui"? Yes, but I have to say that I cannot be biased. I know that in many other troops in the Wujun, foreigners are highly respected. Their troops also treat them as one person, train them in a very high-quality way, and then send them to carry out missions. Why? Because the people who spoke English to us were all dead. Language issues put a lot of pressure on both sides of the Russian and Russian battlefield. Because it was difficult to communicate and it was difficult to cooperate. Macaron told me in the last episode that he couldn't even understand the command of the commander to "sink" at the beginning. In the Ukrainian army, there are also problems. The main obstacles exist between soldiers who speak English and soldiers who speak Western. Gao Shan said that the two sides could not communicate and cooperate with difficulties. So his A-list and E-list were originally divided into English and Western. 但是,從他發給我的照片來看,到2023年,至少150位烏克蘭國際軍團的士兵陣亡。隨著傷亡和離開,英語牌和西語牌長年都不能滿邊。那麼到了2024年10月份的時候,彭程亮所在的連已經是多餘種的混編。當他跟俄軍交火的時候,大約在40米之外有一個友軍的據點,但是據他的隊友告訴我,當天並沒有救援。 潘卫洋说,在没有救援的情况下,彭正亮只剩一条路可以走,就是拔腿狂奔。所以很多人都说,他第一次任务,或者是他什么什么任务,然后死掉,他没有经验,这个观点是错的。这个你能解释一下吗?今天二户战争,它是一场全面战争,所有的战争,所有的战斗,它都是在很短的时间内,然后就要执行,甚至它是处于一种临场自由发挥。 It's not like the US military. We have plans, we have plans A, B, C, and B. We can't evacuate the sea, we can't evacuate the air, we can't evacuate the land, we have all kinds of ways, all kinds of systems. There's also the so-called "three-military coordination". You know that their army is so awesome. Ukraine is not. Ukraine doesn't have those things. So in this conflict, everything you've been through is just a chance. When I retreated, several Ukrainians covered me. They were all killed. Without them, I couldn't leave that position. 為什麼他們掩護你?因為他們的防線是建立在那個位置,後來我們在往後撤的時候,他們一直揮手讓我們過去。然後我們過去以後,他們沒有撤離,他們還是守在那個地方。就二軍就直接把他們的地方都給炸掉了。當時情況來講,他們知道你們是外籍兵團的嗎?知道,知道。 They really died for us. This is the truth. Because of these Ukrainian soldiers, I can live to this day. So I still have a reason to help them continue fighting. Because they once saved my life. They used many lives to exchange for one. 在这样一场战争中,俄巫双方的中国士兵都将自己的生死存亡视为概率。2024年11月4日上午,30岁的彭辰亮把他的生命交给了概率。他冲过了十字路口,跑向40米之外的右军据点。但这个十字路口的两所房子都有俄军,这段距离完全在他们火力覆盖的范围之内。 He was a fitness coach in China. He often ran. After Li Wufu, he ran 8 kilometers every day. At that time, he tried his best to run the most important 40 meters in his life. He ran in bullets. He ran to the military base. Right at the entrance of this house. His head was hit by a bullet. I got the official reply of Peng Chengliang's superior. The military investigation against his death is in progress. The reason why this investigation is so difficult is because Peng Qialan's body is still on the front line. On the night of the death of the Emperor, on November 4, Wu Jun lost his position. On the second day, Wenyang sent a message to his friend's phone. Liang, I don't know if you really left or if it was a fake. I don't know if you can receive this message. You are one of the best friends I have met in Wuhan. I miss you very much. I miss you very much too. I hope you can be with me. You lost them in a short time. It's hard to explain why it hurts so much. It's like you're in a different country, and all your support is blown away. And then, because they're gone, you're living in a strange world. If there is no war, they will have a good life. They have a kind personality. They can contribute to society. So I think war is like this, taking them away. I can't get over it. So I wanted to tell his father here, if his father could see this video, I said your son is really a... I'm sorry I can't protect Liang-Zai well. I can't bring him back to you either. As his comrade-in-arms, I know him for a long time. I would say that your child is kind and righteous. And in the light of humanity, I would say that he is unyielding. So if anyone wants to give him any criticism, I would say that he is my enemy. 阿亮父亲的工作和生活受到了儿子的影响,他不能够出境到乌克兰去取孩子的遗物处理后事。在给儿子朋友的信息中,他说:我们这代人生活得不易,为了生存没得选。亮这代,可以心顺意走。 她很單純,心地善良,喜歡幫助他人,做自己想做的事。太執著,到了那裡找到自己想要的。她母親知道後,非常非常…… I can't say anymore. A single child makes us worry too much. On Peng Jialiang's Twitter, he once forwarded a video of the Ukrainians sending their farewells on the streets but without a sad little symbol to send farewell to the dead. (The people who are not going to the war are not going to the war. This is our war. You are a foreigner. You have already started a new life. You don't have to go there. I still have a hope in my heart. I can inspire more people through me. I used the fire to light the candle and let it burn. So that not all Chinese people can be a bird in the ground. After the death of Peng Zhiliang, Ejun posted his photo on the Internet and made a red cross on his body. He is called the "Nacai Ancient Man". This is how the Russian army did it. After the death of Zeng Shengguang, his Japanese comrades-in-arms posted photos of Zeng. They said they would be friends in the next life. Seven days after the death of this soldier, the Russian army also attacked him. This Japanese soldier was sent by Gao Shan. Gao Shan hid it. I asked him, "What do you feel when you see it?" He said, "I feel sad." 尊重 心理精力我問他你希望人們怎麼理解他們他說 國際主義戰事為了心中正義的一方你經歷過多場戰爭不同類型的不同國家的 不同地域的跟這場戰爭相比的話你感受有什麼不同嗎這個戰爭太真實了太殘酷了那實體都是一卡車一卡車了 但是隨著時間的推移,隨著戰線的不停的崩潰,身邊戰友死的越來越多,這種信念會減弱,但不會消失。在烏克蘭,也有很多驗戰和反戰的人。這是2024年,彭程亮和一個烏克蘭本地年輕人的合影。這個年輕人試圖逃出烏克蘭,他認為政府腐敗,戰爭只是普京和澤林斯基的事情,他不想為之送死。 在一年之後 彭志朗陣亡 這張照片中間的人空了這位年輕人告訴我說 他不會選擇像彭志朗這樣上戰場但他尊敬這個外國士兵那你對那些不想服兵役的普通平民和你年齡相仿的人 那你對他們怎麼看?我不會責備他們因為我完全可以理解有些人他們本身沒有辦法將生命托付給這種高度的不確定性和風險當中這就是為什麼我們需要軍人的原因因為軍人他們是自願從事這份保家衛國的職業就整體而言對烏克蘭整體的國家戰鬥意志我還是非常敬佩和尊重他們 因為我們不能就是瞄定單一的個體,就整體來說他們的戰鬥意志還是非常強烈的,這點我是非常敬佩的。你剛才說烏克蘭沒有辦法像美軍那樣打仗。因為它這個國家它缺乏資源,它大部分能打到今天都是靠北約和美國的援助,這毋庸置疑。但烏克蘭這場戰爭,它比美國還值得敬佩的是什麼? They use the spirit of democracy to express themselves. Look at their sacrifice, look at their spirit. In this day and age, there are only a few ethnic groups who can do this kind of spiritual I asked Macaroon when I interviewed him in the last episode. He posted the news of the two Chinese soldiers' deaths. Liu Jie and Liu Hongwei. I asked them if there was any memorial ceremony or award ceremony for the Russian side. He said there was none. That's why he accepted my interview. He said that he would die at any time in such a war. And his death would have no meaning. So he chose to tell the truth. 在乌克兰,彭志亮阵亡之后,按照他的意愿,他的朋友阿提把他和曾胜光无中大的照片固定在一起,放在了阵亡军人的广场。曾胜光的母亲看到这张照片之后,发了一个信息给他,说:"谢谢你,孩子。" I want to say to Macron that this is the difference between a normal country and a wrong country. In Russia, you will not have any possibility to be treated normally. If you die, Russians will not commemorate you. 但是在烏克蘭是不一樣的你在烏克蘭的行為會有人記住會有人去給你紀念所以我覺得馬哈龍說他自己是沒有立場的沒有價值觀的我希望如果他看到這個節目的話我希望他能重新思考這個問題價值觀還是很重要的 我采访时,欧无战争正在发生剧烈变化,但结局很难预料。在我采访期间,加入110旅无人机部队的中国国际士兵医院对我说,"他这个头像是在独立广场缅怀劣势的时候拍的。"他说,"也许将来也会有人站在同样的地方,用同样的方式缅怀我。" 而他的同事天下為公發給我這句話 彭真亮生前和阿提去看利沃夫的陣亡軍人廣場時,曾經說,如果他陣亡的話,想長眠在烏克蘭。我採訪的時候,有一個中國女孩也來到了這個廣場。她的名字叫蘇菲,在歐洲一所大學讀哲學博士。聽到彭真亮的故事之後,她到烏克蘭來參軍,當醫療官。 这也是一个女生这个女生很有名的她看她车上其实带了一面美国国旗看到那个上边她的肩膀上面那个黑的青条旗她应该是乌克兰人就是在乌克兰的 军队里边服役的人带着美国国旗是一个不少见的现象不能说常见,但是我都看到过很多乌克兰人,南非人,罗马尼亚人,包括阿亮都带着美国国旗因为美国国旗的象征是为自由民主而战 可惜的是现在这一届川普的政府已经不再维护这样的价值观了我觉得他脑子里只有短期的利益他完全没有想到整个世界秩序的维持是更加长远的在这场战争中人们在做出不同的选择高山对我说他仍然能够感觉到强烈的吸引力想要重回乌克兰战场但是他不会再回去了 找我合适对象结婚吧让我妈安心这是我现在最重要的步骤妈 等你这句话应该很多年了吧是 其实我应该退役 退役之后就开始但是我也比较特殊嘛我父亲去世我才突然给姐姐叫我妈妈说我人为什么要结婚为什么要生孩子 我突然明白了一切。在失去兩位好朋友之後,潘文洋曾經說,"夠了!"他在2024年年底回到台灣,在高雄大學繼續他的學業。但我採訪的時候,他說,他已經寫完了一本書,之後他就要重回烏克蘭。這次不再去國際軍團,而是直接加入烏軍的部隊戰鬥。 People can forget, but the work remains, so the spirit remains. If something really bad happens to me, I hope my spirit can become someone else's living thing. But if you are in the battle at this moment, the pressure you may be under is even greater than before. How do you judge this time? If I were to judge the time, it would be no different from the businessmen. That's how it is for me. So you don't consider it? I don't consider it. We thought we were witnesses to history, but we became fuel of history. But without our fuel, history would not go forward. It would not have a story. Will you feel lonely in the final battle? My soul doesn't represent just one person, but me. My soul is also the one that I've left behind. I think my best friend is in that place. So even if I'm in a corner of the world, I can feel the same existence. As long as I'm holding a gun and wearing military gear, I can feel that they are around me.
