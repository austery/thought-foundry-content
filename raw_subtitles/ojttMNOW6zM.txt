So in 2015,
a bride-to-be uploaded a picture
of a dress to the internet --
(Laughter)
And we all lost our minds.
If you see this as blue
and black, say “Team blue.”
Audience: Team blue!
If you see this as white and gold, how?
How do you see that as white and gold?
(Laughter)
Why does this break our brains so much?
It's because it puts us into confrontation
with the fact that two minds
can perceive the same reality
entirely differently.
I'd like to talk to you about two things.
One, our minds are much
more different than we think.
And two, you should seek out minds
that are different than your own,
because that's where the magic happens.
I get to work with a lot of diverse minds
by virtue of what I do.
I write and produce scripts for animation
on a wide variety of topics,
and I create puzzles and games.
And a few years ago,
I had my own dress moment
where I realized that my brain
works differently
than almost everyone I know.
And I'd like to show you how.
So if you'll indulge me for a second,
please visualize the following.
You can do it with your eyes
open or closed,
whichever gives you
the most vivid mental imagery.
A rocket ship crash lands
on an alien planet.
A creature comes up
to the hatch and knocks.
And someone opens it from within.
So now I'm going to ask you
some questions about what you just saw.
What color was the planet?
What kind of creature was it?
And who opened the hatch?
I'll show you what I see.
Nothing.
That's because I have
a condition called aphantasia,
which is where I don't have access
to my mind's eye.
It turns out that the mind's
eye is a spectrum.
On one end are about two
to four percent of us with aphantasia.
And at the other extreme
is hyperphantasia.
That's where you can visualize
in exquisite detail,
sometimes even able to superimpose
what you're imagining on reality.
That's about three
to six percent of people.
Everyone else is somewhere in between.
But there's a huge range
of experience here.
Everyone I do this with
not only describes something different
but describes the experience
of experiencing it differently.
So I went through most of my life
assuming that most people were
or everyone was like me,
that a visualization exercise like this
is a figure of speech
that no one could actually do.
So imagine my surprise
and fascination and apprehension
when I learned about aphantasia,
the last, because it raised
some scary questions like,
have I been working in entirely
the wrong careers my entire life?
(Laughter)
So aphantasia changes the way
that those of us who have it
perceive information
and consume and process information.
So, for example, most people I speak to
who have a mind's eye
describe the experience of reading a novel
as seeing scenes play out
in their mind and casting characters.
I can't do either of those things.
It's a much more conceptual
experience for me.
And when something is out of sight,
it's very much out of mind.
I have a five-year-old daughter.
I can't in this moment imagine her face.
That has a big effect on my memory.
And it's also not just my mind's eye,
it's also my mind's ear,
though I think I have
a little bit of a mind's ear,
but I don't have a mind's
nose or a mind's mouth.
I can't, for example,
imagine the taste of peanut butter.
And what's it like to think
in the absence of a mind's eye?
It's a really tough question
that's not that far off from asking
what's it like to be
a dolphin or a spider?
And in the absence of being able
to inhabit each other's consciousnesses,
we can communicate about them.
So for me,
I'm generally much more aware
of something's skeleton than its skin.
I'm very attuned to structure.
When I'm creating a game or a puzzle,
I'm first dreaming up the mechanics
and figuring out
how they relate to each other,
how they map to a story structure.
And the details come later,
often in collaboration with other artists.
I realize there's a leap of faith here
in this idea that our minds
can be so alien to each other,
and I struggle with that, too.
I can't understand
what it's like to visualize
any more than I can see
the dress as white and gold.
But what's become increasingly apparent
is that the mind's eye
is just one of many constellations
we're starting to draw in a night sky
full of neurological diversity.
That includes having or not having
an interior monologue.
It includes the autism spectrum,
ADHD, dyslexia and a lot more.
Probably a lot of things
we have yet to even give a name to
because we're just figuring
all of this out.
The norm is to pathologize
these experiences
into a list of conditions
that depart from a so-called
“normal” functioning of the mind.
I think we're thinking
about this completely wrong.
There is no true normal out there,
and difference is not deviance.
Rather, these are all clues
towards a vast and profound star field
we're each individually blinded to
because we only have our one
cozy, inescapable mind
as a single reference point.
It's no secret that different
people think differently.
Many people on the autism spectrum
excel at pattern recognition
and logical deduction.
Multiple studies have shown
students with ADHD outperforming,
on average, their peers,
at creative problem solving
and divergent thinking tasks,
and there are very similar
findings for dyslexia,
especially when it comes
to advanced spatial reasoning.
So if difference is in fact the norm,
what do we do with that?
I say seek out minds
that are different than your own
and make something incredible together.
There's a wealth of research
that shows that teams of people
from diverse backgrounds
produce superior outcomes.
I'd like to propose a corollary to this:
diverse minds working together
can produce wonders.
This comes with challenges
and opportunities.
So in the last decade or so,
companies such as SAP,
Hewlett Packard and JPMorgan
have started programs
designed to recruit neurodivergent talent.
And in the time since, they've reported
corresponding gains in productivity,
morale, innovation and quality.
I see this in my own work as well.
Again, by the serendipity
of working in visual fields
without being able to visualize,
I wind up working with a lot of minds
who are very different than mine.
And that results in some weird
and wonderful work,
such as a film noir animation
about fractals that I coauthored
that was brought to life by a brilliant
hyperphantasic animator
named Jeremiah Dickey.
Or this is one of my pride and joys.
It's a game that's a hybrid
jigsaw puzzle and escape room in a box.
And the way it works -- yeah.
(Laughter)
The way it works
is you first assemble a jigsaw,
but you're missing big sections,
so you have to unlock them
by solving puzzles
that are embedded
in the illustration and artifacts
that you unlock along the way.
This was made in collaboration
with two incredible artists,
Rita Orlov and Senne Trip,
and our minds can be found
in very different corners
of the galaxy of neurological diversity.
So am I working in the wrong fields?
No, I don't think so.
I think I'm exactly where I should be.
In fact, some of the greatest joy
and fulfillment in my life
has been from coming to terms
with the initially jarring realization
that my mind works differently
than the people around me,
and recognizing that
for what it is -- dazzling.
Thank you.
(Cheers and applause)
