>> Do
 you
 guys
 know
 what
 today
 is?


>> It's
 our
 10y
 year
 anniversary
 because


everyone
 keeps
 sending
 us.


>> I
 know.
 We
 only
 we
 knew
 we
 only
 knew
 I


didn't
 realize
 that
 today
 was
 the
 actual


10
 year
 anniversary
 until
 I
 started


getting
 emails
 from
 random
 people
 this


morning.
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 happy
 10


years."
 Like,
 what?


>> Random
 Bloomberg
 people,
 too.


>> I
 thought
 I
 would
 be
 the
 first
 to


remember.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 [laughter]
 Sorry,
 Dad.
 it
 in


our
 hearts.
 You
 were
 the
 first.


>> Yes.
 10
 years
 ago
 today,
 the
 first


episode
 of
 Odd
 Lbox.


>> I
 do
 have
 uh
 I
 forget
 who
 sent
 this
 to


me.
 I
 have
 a
 mug.


>> U
 Yeah.
 So,
 happy
 anniversary
 to
 us.


>> Happy
 birthday.


>> Happy
 birthday.


>> What
 did
 you
 get
 me?


>> I
 guess
 this
 is
 a
 little
 weird.
 Happy


anniversary
 to
 us.
 Happy
 birthday
 to
 uh


OddLots.
 Um
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 what?
 Wait,


I
 didn't
 get
 you
 anything.


>> I
 know
 you
 didn't.
 [laughter]


I
 wait
 I
 wait
 with
 baited
 breath
 for
 a


gift
 from
 Joe
 one
 of
 these
 days.


>> You
 know
 what?
 Um
 no,
 that's
 not
 true.


I've
 gotten
 you
 a
 gift.
 Name
 one.


>> I
 always
 bring
 back
 sweets
 when
 I


travel.
 Um,
 everyone
 does
 that.
 I
 know.


I
 guess
 that
 doesn't
 count.
 You're


right.
 You
 know
 what
 would
 be
 a
 really


wonderful
 gift?


>> What?


>> Uh,
 fresh
 jobs
 data.


>> Oh,
 yes.


[music]


>> I
 did
 a
 dead
 list.


>> I
 am
 both
 the
 most
 popular
 trader
 and


most
 successful
 trader
 at
 Citadel.


>> Feta's
 going
 viral.


>> Uh,
 barges.
 This
 is
 an
 after
 school


special
 except


>> I've
 decided
 I'm
 going
 to
 base
 my
 entire


personality
 going
 forward
 on
 campaigning


for
 a
 strategic
 pork
 reserve
 in
 the
 US.


>> Black
 gold.


>> These
 are
 the
 the
 important
 questions.


Is
 it
 robots
 taking
 over
 the
 world?


>> No,
 I
 think
 that
 like
 in
 a
 couple
 years


the
 AI
 will
 do
 a
 really
 good
 job
 of


making
 the
 OddLots
 podcast.
 One
 day
 that


person
 will
 have
 the
 mandate
 of
 heaven.


>> How
 do
 I
 get
 more
 popular
 and


successful?


>> We
 do
 have


>> the
 perfect
 guest.
 You're
 listening
 to


Lots
 More,
 where
 we
 catch
 up
 with


friends
 about
 what's
 going
 on
 right
 now.


>> Because
 even
 when
 The
 Odd
 Lots
 is
 over,


there's
 always
 lots
 more.


>> And
 we
 really
 do
 have
 the
 perfect
 guest.


>> I
 don't
 know
 about
 you
 guys,
 but
 I
 did


not
 expect
 to
 miss
 the
 NFP
 as
 much
 as
 I


I
 am
 at
 the
 moment.
 I
 just
 thought,
 you


know,
 we
 have
 all
 the
 alt
 data,
 things


will
 be
 fine.


>> It
 doesn't
 hit
 the
 same,
 does
 it,


Connor?


>> It
 does
 not.
 I
 mean
 [laughter]
 ADP
 like


having
 to
 care
 about
 ADP
 is
 just
 the


worst.


>> You're
 like
 all
 these
 estimates
 or


whatever.
 It's
 like
 it
 just
 doesn't
 even


if
 you
 know
 it's
 coming
 out
 it
 doesn't


hit
 the
 same.
 There's
 nothing
 like
 uh


>> the
 Chicago
 Fed
 estimate
 of
 unemployment


like
 all
 right
 Austin
 Goulsby
 I
 like
 you


but
 [laughter]
 not
 not
 the
 same.
 Well,


wait.


>> We
 got
 to
 get
 him
 on
 here.
 And


>> okay,
 so
 the
 one
 upside
 of
 not
 having


the
 official
 data,
 the
 official
 jobs


data
 because
 of
 the
 government
 shutdown


is
 everyone
 gets
 to
 be
 really
 mean
 about


the
 alt
 data,
 right?
 And
 say
 like
 really


harsh
 things
 about
 why
 they
 don't
 like


ADP.
 But
 could
 someone
 just
 remind
 me


why
 we
 hate
 ADP?


>> Oh
 yeah.
 What's
 wrong
 with
 it,
 Connor?


>> I
 mean,
 it's
 always
 they
 revise
 it
 to


the
 BLS
 data.
 So
 it's
 like
 here's
 our


estimate
 and
 then
 6
 months
 later
 you


revise
 it.
 So
 then
 the
 historical
 data


looks
 fine,
 but
 in
 the
 moment
 it's


actually
 not
 the
 same
 at
 all.


>> It's
 interesting
 because
 you
 know
 people


always
 say
 like
 ADP,
 oh
 it
 missed
 again,


but
 it
 is
 a
 little
 weird
 and
 it
 gets
 to


I
 think
 some
 philosophical
 things
 which


aren't
 necessarily
 worth
 diving
 into
 for


a
 conversation
 about
 what
 does
 it
 even


mean
 to
 be
 right
 or
 wrong.
 I
 mean
 NFP


gets
 revised
 all
 the
 time.
 NFP
 is
 just
 a


model
 for
 the
 real
 economy.
 You
 know,


little
 confusing
 the
 map
 and
 the


territory
 stuff.
 Anyway,
 when
 people
 are


listening
 to
 this,
 it
 should
 have
 been


jobs
 day
 and
 so
 I
 don't
 really
 think


there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 report
 unless


somehow
 the
 government
 gets
 hope.
 I


don't
 think
 that's
 uh
 happening.


>> This
 is
 our
 gift
 to
 OddLotss
 listeners.


In
 celebration
 of
 our
 10y
 year


anniversary,
 we
 are
 bringing
 you
 this


labor
 market
 episode
 of
 uh
 Lotsmore


brought
 to
 you
 by
 OddLots
 and
 and
 it's
 a


poor
 substitute
 perhaps,
 but
 it's
 the


best
 that
 we
 can
 do.


>> So
 this
 morning
 there
 was
 a
 headline


challenger
 which
 has
 never
 been
 a


particularly
 like
 topshelf
 data
 point


for
 me.
 like
 they
 said
 the
 worst
 month


for
 layoffs
 in
 20
 years.
 On
 the
 other


hand,
 an
 initial
 claims
 have
 been


steady.
 Uh
 also
 there
 was
 a
 headline


from
 U.
 Cleveland
 Fed's
 hammock.
 She's


more
 concerned
 about
 inflation
 than


employment
 right
 now
 in
 terms
 of
 risk
 to


the
 dual
 mandate.
 Connor,
 you've
 sort
 of


pretty
 taking
 the
 opposite
 view.
 You


think
 the
 labor
 market
 situation
 is


pretty
 serious
 and
 urgent,
 maybe


underappreciated
 as
 a
 risk.
 You
 probably


disagree
 with
 uh


>> we've
 had
 this
 low
 hires
 low
 fires
 labor


market
 for
 at
 least
 18
 to
 24
 months
 now.


And
 I
 think
 we
 have
 evidence
 over
 the


past
 few
 months
 that
 at least
 there's
 no


reason
 for
 low
 fires
 to
 still
 be


happening
 in
 corporate
 America.
 They


don't
 have
 to
 hoard
 labor
 because
 if


nothing
 else,
 if
 you
 really
 want
 to


hire,
 there's
 plenty
 of
 young
 people.


There's
 plenty
 of
 long-term
 unemployed


people
 to
 hire.
 Unemployment
 rates
 kind


of
 low,
 but
 there's
 plenty
 of
 slack
 out


there
 to
 hire
 people.
 So
 to
 the
 extent


that
 like
 Amazon
 has
 shown
 the
 way
 of
 we


don't
 need
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 our
 co
 workers


anymore
 that
 could
 give
 permission
 to


other
 companies
 to
 do
 the
 same
 and
 at
 a


time
 when
 everybody's
 trying
 to
 cut


costs
 that
 could
 snowball
 a
 little
 bit.


>> Wait
 so
 just
 going
 back
 to
 the
 ADP
 data


for
 a
 second.
 So
 sorry
 I
 hate
 to
 do
 this


but
 according
 to
 ADP
 payrolls
 were
 up


>> we're
 going to
 get
 a
 call
 from
 ADP.


They're
 going
 to
 want
 to
 come
 on
 and


defend
 which
 is
 fine.
 Well,
 I'm
 I'm


trying
 to
 get
 to
 some
 of
 the
 tension


here.
 But,
 okay,
 jobs
 up
 42,000
 for


October
 and
 then
 we
 get
 the
 challenger


data
 for
 that
 same
 month
 and
 as
 Joe


said,
 it's
 like
 the
 worst
 job
 cuts
 in
 20


years.
 I
 think
 over
 150,000
 cut.
 Why


does
 it
 seem
 like
 we
 are
 getting
 these


two
 very
 different
 streams
 of


[clears throat]
 jobs
 data
 at
 the
 moment


where
 we
 do
 have
 some
 alternative
 data


points
 that
 are
 coming
 in
 better
 than


expected
 and
 then
 we
 have
 some
 that
 are


just
 coming
 in
 that
 look
 almost
 I
 don't


want
 to
 say
 depression
 level
 but
 like


certainly
 worse
 than
 it
 feels
 at
 the


moment.


>> Well,
 the
 way
 the
 challenger
 data
 works


is
 it's
 announced
 layoffs.
 So
 that
 could


be
 anything
 from
 UPS
 saying
 we've
 laid


off
 50,000
 people
 over
 the
 past
 12


months
 or
 announced
 job
 cuts
 that


haven't
 happened
 yet.
 So
 they're
 just


headlines,
 not
 actual
 job
 cuts
 that


month.


>> Oh,
 I
 see.
 Okay.
 So
 it's
 aggregating


just
 people
 saying
 stuff
 and
 we're
 still


not
 entirely
 sure
 whether
 or
 not


>> headline
 aggregation,
 not
 confirmed


layoffs
 that
 month.


>> What
 do
 we
 know
 about
 initial
 claims?


>> So
 the
 initial
 claims
 are
 still
 pretty


low.
 I
 think
 one
 thing
 we're
 dealing


with
 right
 now
 is
 that
 the


year-over-year
 is
 incorporating
 the
 the


hurricane
 Hela
 situation
 from
 last
 year.


So
 if
 you
 remember
 that
 was
 end
 of


September.
 Then
 you
 saw
 claims
 in
 North


Carolina
 and
 Florida
 and
 the
 southeast


as
 people
 were,
 you
 know,
 there
 was


flooding
 and
 so
 companies
 were
 closed


for
 a
 while.
 So
 you
 saw
 a
 spike
 in


claims
 in
 October.
 So
 we're
 kind
 of


lapping
 that
 period.
 And
 so
 to
 the


extent
 that
 the
 year-over-years
 don't


look
 bad
 right
 now,
 that
 could
 be


partially
 a
 hurricane
 impact.


>> Do
 you
 have
 like
 a
 shadow
 NFP
 figure
 in


your
 mind
 that
 you're
 working
 on?


>> For
 me,
 it's
 just
 sort
 of
 I
 don't
 think


jobs
 are
 really
 growing
 in
 the
 aggregate


right
 now.
 Certainly
 ex
 healthcare.
 And


so
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 we
 think
 corporate


earnings
 are
 going
 to
 grow
 10%
 over
 the


next
 12
 months,
 how
 do
 you
 grow
 earnings


10%
 if
 there's
 no
 job
 growth?
 It
 just


seems
 like
 you
 need
 a
 real
 productivity


miracle
 or
 some
 sort
 of
 compositional


dynamic
 to
 get
 there.
 If
 the
 labor


market
 is
 substantially
 weakening,
 we


are
 going
 to
 revisit
 the
 cyclical
 versus


structural
 debate.
 Except
 this
 time
 the


structural
 argument
 would
 be
 that
 it
 has


something
 to
 do
 with
 AI.
 And
 if
 the
 call


and
 that
 if
 AI
 is
 driving
 job
 loss,


which
 I'm
 not
 really
 convinced
 by,
 but


if
 AI
 is
 dropping
 driving
 job
 loss,
 then


rate
 cuts
 aren't
 going
 to
 do
 much.
 Like


what
 is
 Yeah,


>> can
 I
 give
 you
 my
 conundrum
 of
 what
 I


think
 is
 going
 on?
 I
 think
 about
 Craig


Fuller
 and
 precommodity
 markets
 and
 all


the
 supply
 chain
 episodes
 you
 guys
 did


>> and
 I
 think
 about
 there
 sort
 of
 the


contracted
 rate
 of
 like
 promotions
 and


jobs
 that
 people
 got
 in
 2022,
 home


prices
 people
 committed
 to
 in
 2022
 and


then
 like
 the
 spot
 market
 which
 is


long-term
 unemployed
 young
 people


>> resale
 housing
 inventory.
 And
 I
 feel


like
 the
 spot
 market
 wants
 to
 get
 back


to
 2019
 affordability
 and
 then
 the


contracted
 market
 wants
 to
 stay
 at
 2022


prices.
 And
 there's
 this
 really
 growing


tension
 between
 the
 two
 as
 as
 the
 spot


market's
 trying
 to
 drag
 down
 the


contracted
 market
 so
 to
 speak.


>> So
 to
 understand
 this
 to
 maybe
 the
 way


to
 think
 about
 this
 is
 that
 there
 is
 a


seat
 that
 a
 company
 has


a
 role
 and
 the
 person
 sitting
 in
 that


seat
 might
 be
 taking
 in
 $150,000


currently.
 But
 if
 that
 seat
 were
 open


and
 they
 had
 to
 hire
 for
 it,
 maybe
 it


would
 only
 be
 they
 could
 hire
 for
 that


role
 for
 100,000
 or
 90,000
 or
 110,000.


And
 thus
 the
 gap
 between
 contract
 and


spot,


>> right?
 And
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 it's
 you


think
 about
 like
 a
 bank
 analyst
 [snorts]


program
 where
 you
 hire
 a
 bunch
 of
 21


year olds.
 Maybe
 they
 were
 making


$100,000
 in
 2020
 and
 then
 that
 that
 got


raised
 at
 150
 in
 2022
 because
 the
 job


market
 was
 so
 strong.
 Those
 analysts


then
 become
 associates
 and
 then
 there's


kind
 of
 an
 expectation
 they're
 going
 to


leave
 for
 business
 school
 or
 private


equity
 or
 whatever,
 but
 because
 the


labor
 market's
 so
 bad,
 they
 don't
 want


to
 leave.
 and
 they
 might
 be
 perfectly


fine
 people,
 but
 at
 some
 point
 you're


like,
 "Well,
 we
 need
 to
 kind
 of
 kick
 you


out
 to
 make
 room
 for
 the
 next
 21
 year


olds."
 Almost
 like
 if
 a
 college
 like


University
 of
 Texas,
 if
 the
 seniors
 were


like,
 "We're
 not
 leaving
 cuz
 the
 job


market's
 [laughter]
 weak.
 We're
 just


going
 to
 stay."
 And
 at
 some
 point,
 Texas


is
 like, "Well,
 we
 have
 freshmen
 that


need
 beds.
 You
 have
 to
 leave."


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I
 worry
 we're
 kind
 of
 getting
 there.


>> There's
 a
 whole
 movie
 about
 Ryan


Reynolds
 trying
 to
 stay
 at
 university


because
 of
 a
 lackluster
 job
 market,
 I


presume.
 Anyway,
 the
 other
 thing
 that


everyone
 seems
 to
 be
 debating
 at
 the


moment
 is
 the
 impact
 of
 immigration
 or


lack
 thereof
 on
 the
 total
 labor
 market


and
 what
 that
 means
 for
 supply.
 And


depending
 on
 where
 you
 come
 out
 on
 this


particular
 debate,
 you
 might
 have
 very


different
 impressions
 of
 what's
 going
 on


at
 the
 moment.
 What
 side
 of
 it
 are
 you


sort
 of
 landing
 on?


>> I
 think
 it's
 fair
 to
 say
 that
 the
 break


even
 jobs
 rate
 is
 much
 lower.
 Like
 maybe


it's
 30,000.
 Um
 but
 also
 supply
 kind
 of


generates
 demand
 as
 well.
 And
 I
 think


you
 can
 look
 at
 housing
 to
 show
 that.
 Um


I
 don't know
 if
 he'll
 appreciate
 me


calling
 him
 out,
 but
 Lee
 Everett,
 who


you've
 had
 on
 to
 talk
 about
 multif


family
 a
 couple
 times.
 I
 asked
 him,
 do


you
 think
 that
 reduced
 immigration
 is
 is


hurting
 multif
 family
 performance?


Because
 Q3
 was
 pretty
 soft
 for


apartments.
 And
 his
 view
 is
 it's
 not


like
 undocumented
 migrants
 are
 living
 in


class
 A
 and
 class
 B
 apartments,
 but
 if


you
 don't
 have
 population
 growth,
 you


don't
 need
 job
 growth.
 And
 if
 you
 don't


have
 job
 growth,
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 sign


an
 apartment
 lease.
 So
 it
 might
 not
 be


directly
 leading
 to
 weakness
 and
 and


whatever,
 but
 it's
 sort
 of
 that
 demand


weakness
 is
 showing
 up
 elsewhere
 in
 in


housing,
 in
 consumer
 staples,
 things


like
 that.


>> Let's
 get
 back
 to
 the
 AI
 question.
 Do


you
 think
 it's
 playing
 some
 role
 in
 cuts


because
 yeah,
 I'll
 leave
 it
 at
 that.


>> I
 think
 in
 two
 ways,
 yes,
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 that
 the
 technology
 is
 displacing


workers,
 but
 I
 think
 that
 companies
 are


first
 cost
 constrained
 and
 they
 feel


like
 they
 have
 to
 invest
 in
 AI.
 So,
 if


you
 have
 to
 increase
 your
 your
 budget


somewhere,
 you've
 got
 to
 cut
 it


somewhere
 else.
 And
 labor
 is
 a
 good
 way


to
 do
 that.
 And
 then
 I
 just
 think
 the


vibes
 in
 general
 of
 well,
 if
 you're


hiring
 a
 bunch
 of
 people,
 you're


probably
 a
 loser
 that
 doesn't
 get
 AI.


And
 so,
 you
 can't
 look
 like
 a
 loser,
 so


you're
 just
 not
 doing
 it.


>> Yeah.
 This
 is
 what
 I
 worry
 about
 with


the
 optics,
 which
 is
 if
 there
 are
 a


bunch
 of
 companies
 recently
 who
 have


seen
 their
 share
 prices
 go
 down.
 And


we're
 recording
 this
 at
 lunchtime,
 so


all
 the
 food
 ones
 are
 on
 my
 mind.
 But


for
 instance,
 McDonald's,
 Chipotle,


right,
 came
 out
 with
 disappointing


earnings
 and
 shares
 are
 going
 down.
 If


you're
 a
 company
 watching
 your
 stock


price
 go
 down,
 you're
 thinking
 about
 the


levers
 you
 can
 pull
 to
 make
 it
 go
 up
 in


the
 future.
 Price
 increases
 probably


aren't
 going
 to
 work
 when
 everyone's


already
 complaining
 that,
 you
 know,
 a


cheeseburger
 and
 fries
 over
 at


McDonald's
 are
 like
 more
 than
 $10
 now.


But
 one
 thing
 you
 can
 do
 is
 say,
 "Well,


we're
 going
 to
 cut
 workers."
 And
 by


cutting
 workers,
 look
 at
 us.
 we
 really


understand
 AI
 and
 we're
 in
 on
 like
 the


current
 trend
 or
 craze.


>> Something
 McDonald's
 did
 18
 months
 ago


is
 they
 finally
 when
 everything
 was


slumping
 in
 23
 and
 24,
 their
 comp
 sales


in
 the
 US
 went
 negative


>> and
 they
 had
 this
 big
 earnings
 call


saying,
 "We've
 always
 prided
 oursel
 on


value.
 Our
 value
 gap
 versus
 our
 peers


has
 really
 compressed,
 but
 we
 are
 going


to
 win
 at
 value
 whatever
 it
 takes."


Almost
 like
 a
 draggy
 moment
 for
 us
 fast


[laughter]
 food.
 And
 they
 introduced


this
 $5
 value
 meal.
 this
 they
 caught
 MCV


value
 their
 new
 program
 that
 they


launched
 earlier
 this
 year
 and
 they've


really
 clawed
 that
 value
 gap
 back
 and
 so


it's
 sort
 of
 like
 they're
 going
 to
 claim


their
 market
 share
 and
 then
 everybody


else
 is
 going
 to
 lose
 traffic
 to


McDonald's
 and
 so
 I
 think
 they're
 kind


of
 fine
 but
 everybody
 and
 it
 kind
 of


gets
 to
 that
 contracted
 versus
 spot


economy
 framework
 where
 McDonald's
 got


back
 to
 where
 they
 need
 to
 be
 everybody


else
 isn't
 there
 and
 they're
 all
 trying


to
 figure
 out
 how
 do
 we
 deal
 with
 this


environment
 where
 demand
 is
 weak
 and


consumers
 are
 very
 price
 pressured


>> I
 want
 to
 say
 Joe
 I
 have
 yet
 to


experience
 the
 um
 rebound
 of
 value
 at


McDonald's.
 I
 I
 had
 a
 uh
 moment
 of


weakness
 on
 Monday
 and
 I
 did


>> and
 it
 was
 costly.


>> It
 was
 costly.
 I
 went
 through
 the


drive-thru.
 I
 didn't
 use
 the
 app,
 so


that
 was
 probably
 the
 problem.
 But
 like


it
 is
 not
 nothing
 to
 get
 a
 meal
 from


McDonald's
 nowadays.


>> When
 do
 my
 favorite
 thing
 is
 uh
 whenever


like
 a
 sector
 comes
 up,
 I
 start
 like


pulling
 up
 stock
 charts
 on
 the
 terminal.


Sweet
 green,
 that
 was
 a
 $45
 stock
 last


November.
 This
 is
 maybe
 the
 biggest


Trump
 loser.
 It
 was
 $44.
 Now
 it's
 a
 $6


stock.
 Cava


was
 a


$150


stock
 also
 in
 late
 2024.
 Now
 it's
 a
 $47


stock.
 I
 mean,
 these
 are
 like,
 you
 know,


these
 are
 the
 tip
 of
 the
 sphere,
 the


most
 cutting
 edge
 slot
 bowls
 you
 can


get.
 And
 they're


>> Yeah.
 I
 feel
 like
 if
 you
 were
 the
 kind


of
 person
 working
 for
 like
 Shaw's


group
 and
 like
 eating
 lunch
 in
 DC,
 the


kinds
 of
 things
 you're
 eating,
 that's


like
 in
 a
 bad
 recession
 now.
 Those
 types


of
 workers.


>> I
 do.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 not
 funny.


It's
 a
 It's
 true.
 I
 also
 Tracy
 like
 when


I
 I
 love
 our
 DC
 listeners
 so
 I
 don't


want
 to
 insult
 people
 in
 DC
 but
 when
 I


think
 of
 like
 what
 is
 the
 city
 which
 I'm


certain
 has
 the
 highest
 percentage
 of


people
 that
 sort
 of
 eat
 a
 bowl
 lunch
 I


always
 think
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 workforce


it
 must
 be
 DC
 and
 I
 do


>> actually
 founded
 and
 Sweet
 Green
 both


Cava
 and
 Sweet
 Green
 are
 like
 this
 is


true
 innovation
 serving
 the
 local
 market


and
 so
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 interesting
 that


DC
 is
 an
 industrial
 hotbed
 for
 these


kind
 of
 lunches


>> I'll
 just
 say
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 sad
 salad


eaters
 uh
 here
 in
 New
 York,
 including


Joe.
 But
 I
 am
 willing
 to
 say
 that
 Cava


and
 Sweet
 Green
 are
 certainly
 that
 sort


of
 um
 I
 guess
 liberal
 bureaucratic


government
 official
 um
 coded


>> your
 meal.
 Yeah,
 your
 rations.


>> They
 are.
 Yeah,
 they
 are.
 Here's
 your


bowl
 of
 salad.


>> Oh
 man.


>> Well,
 and
 you're
 hearing
 like
 Chipotle


talked
 about
 weakness
 among
 25
 to
 35


year olds,
 not
 just
 20
 to
 24
 year olds.


So
 it
 does
 seem
 like
 that
 weakness
 is


kind
 of
 creeping
 up
 the
 income
 scale,


the
 age
 ladder,
 and
 you
 know,
 maybe
 the


AMX
 consumer
 is
 still
 fine,
 but
 it
 just


seems
 like
 the
 weakness
 is
 moving
 up
 the


income
 curve.


[music]


>> We
 were
 actually
 talking
 about
 the
 labor


market,
 and
 I
 know
 this
 is
 related,
 but


one
 one
 thing
 that
 kind
 of
 worries
 me
 at


the
 moment
 is
 that


Even
 if
 the
 government
 opens
 up
 tomorrow


and
 NFP
 gets
 released
 soon
 after
 that,


it
 feels
 like
 it's
 just
 going
 to
 be


messy.
 And
 even
 if
 we
 get
 the
 official


number,
 it's
 not
 actually
 going
 to
 be


that
 insightful
 and
 we're
 still
 going
 to


be
 spending
 all
 our
 time
 having
 the


debates
 that
 we're
 having
 right
 now.


>> I
 think
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 a
 clean


read
 on
 the
 data
 until
 at least
 January


just
 because
 October
 is
 gonna
 be
 a
 mess.


Who
 knows
 when
 we're
 going to
 get
 the


data.
 Then
 even
 if
 the
 government


reopens
 then
 you
 have
 the
 November
 data


is
 impacted
 by
 the
 shutdown
 which
 so


>> yeah
 we're
 kind
 of
 just
 twiddling
 our


thumbs
 until
 your
 end.


>> So
 let's
 talk
 about
 you
 know
 let's
 put


it
 in
 the
 stakes
 for
 the
 Fed.
 If
 you


were
 the
 Fed
 chair
 which
 you
 know
 you


probably
 play
 fantasy
 Fed
 chair
 in
 your


mind.


>> There's
 a
 nonzero
 chance
 that
 Connor


could
 one
 day


>> or
 certain
 [laughter]
 Yeah.
 certainly
 a


governor.
 Um
 well
 like
 what
 what
 do
 you


like
 is
 there
 an
 effective
 move
 here?
 Is


the
 is
 it
 keep
 cutting
 rates
 and
 how


effective
 would
 they
 be?
 Play
 it
 out


from
 the
 Fed
 framework.
 What
 I
 think


they're
 thinking
 is
 that
 we
 keep
 missing


on
 inflation.
 We
 don't
 know
 if
 tariffs


are
 going
 to
 lead
 to
 une
 unanchanchored


inflation
 expectations.
 Even
 though
 they


don't
 take
 the
 stock
 market
 into


account,
 I
 do
 think
 on
 some
 vibes
 level


if
 the
 stock
 market's
 high,
 that
 doesn't


force
 their
 hand.
 And
 they
 they're


really
 anchoring
 to
 the
 unemployment


rate
 is
 historically
 low,
 which
 kind
 of,


but
 again,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 long-term


unemployment
 numbers,
 age
 2024,
 kind
 of


that
 spot
 labor
 market
 uh
 groups,
 that's


actually
 quite
 weak.
 That's
 more
 of
 like


a
 2015
 type
 labor
 market.
 And
 I
 just


think
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 anything


until
 their
 hand
 is
 forced.
 But
 again,


for
 me,
 I
 see
 housing
 getting
 worse.


We've
 the
 Fed's
 cut
 rates
 150
 basis


points
 and
 housing
 is
 worse
 now
 than
 it


was
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 ago.
 So
 I
 think


the
 whole
 when
 the
 Fed
 cuts
 rates,


housing's
 going
 to
 be
 fixed
 has
 not


proven
 to
 be
 true.
 And
 the
 labor
 market


doesn't
 seem
 to
 be
 getting
 better
 yet.


So
 outside
 of
 AI,
 it's
 just
 hard
 to
 see


any
 upward
 momentum
 heading
 into
 2026.


If
 you
 were
 at
 the
 Fed
 dealing
 with
 an


AI
 economy
 versus
 the
 economy
 of
 10


years
 ago,
 let
 alone
 30
 or
 40
 years
 ago,


but
 let's
 say
 10
 years
 ago,
 does
 that


make
 you
 think
 about
 monetary
 policy
 and


the
 transmission
 mechanism
 different
 at


all?
 Joe
 kind
 of
 got
 at
 this
 earlier,


but


>> yeah,
 it's
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 we
 all


live
 through
 the
 mid-200s
 and
 then
 the


the
 bust
 and
 the
 bailouts,
 and
 it's


like,
 should
 the
 Fed
 have
 prevented


OpenAI
 from
 making
 these
 commitments?


Should
 the
 Fed
 have
 prevented
 Nvidia


from
 doing
 vendor
 finance
 on
 the
 scale


they
 have?
 Maybe
 we'll
 say
 in
 hindsight,


yes.
 But
 like
 in
 the
 moment,
 which
 is


right
 now,
 come
 on.
 Like
 that's
 not


going
 to
 happen.
 So,
 I'm
 a
 little
 more


sympathetic
 now
 to
 the
 Fed
 being
 blind


to
 certain
 things
 in
 the
 boom,


especially
 when
 it's
 sort
 of
 outside
 of


their
 their
 mandate
 just
 because


>> it's


>> right.
 They're
 not
 AI
 regulators.


>> No.
 Exactly.
 And
 it's
 also
 with
 with


Trump,
 it's
 not
 like
 they're
 going
 to
 be


telling
 Sam
 Alman
 he
 can't
 do
 what
 he's


doing.
 So,
 I
 feel
 like
 they're
 going
 to


probably
 have
 a
 role
 in
 the
 cleanup,
 but


in
 the
 moment
 there's
 not
 a
 whole
 lot


they
 can
 do.


>> It's
 funny
 that
 we're
 already
 like


projecting
 it
 so
 far
 forward,
 but
 it
 is


I
 mean
 this
 is
 and
 I
 really
 want
 to
 do


more
 on
 this.
 I
 think
 the
 politics
 of
 AI


are
 going
 to
 be
 huge
 in
 2028
 and
 I


expect
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 it's
 very


plausible
 to
 me
 that
 the
 AI
 industry
 at


the
 same
 time
 is
 a
 very
 big
 deal
 in
 the


US
 touch
 and
 sort
 of
 friendless
 in
 DC.


It
 seems
 very
 plausible.
 Seems
 very


plausible
 to
 me
 that
 in
 2028
 the
 story


is
 most
 people
 again
 2028
 it's
 a


lifetime
 from
 now
 in
 both
 politics
 and


technology
 but
 it
 could
 be
 a
 story
 where


it's
 like
 here's
 this
 thing
 it's
 really


important
 or
 there's
 tons
 of
 investment


in
 it
 but
 people
 for
 the
 most
 part


either
 mostly
 see
 it
 as
 a
 job
 killer


slash
 an
 electricity
 price
 booster
 and


there
 are
 some
 you
 know
 the
 stakes
 are


going
 to
 be
 very
 high
 and
 I
 expect
 sort


of
 like
 especially
 on
 the
 republic
 Repan


primary.
 I
 would
 expect
 I
 would
 expect


the
 Democrats
 to
 sort
 of
 be
 more


comfortable.
 Their
 antagonism
 towards


big
 tech
 has
 obviously
 been,
 you
 know,


several
 years.
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be


some
 interesting
 divisions
 on
 the
 GOP


side
 in
 terms
 of
 which
 lanes
 and
 I
 think


there
 is
 going
 to
 be
 an
 AI
 lane
 or
 an


anti-aline
 AI
 lane.
 You
 already
 see


Ronda
 Santis,
 he's
 been
 tweeting
 a
 lot


about
 this.
 I
 think
 that's
 very
 telling.


Well,
 it's
 also
 in
 2024,
 the
 the
 MAGA


coalition
 was
 kind
 of
 workingass
 voters


of
 all
 races
 and
 ethnicities
 and
 then


tech
 and
 VC.
 Yeah.


>> And
 it's
 just
 hard
 to
 see
 how
 their


interests
 are
 truly
 aligned
 on
 AI.


>> Let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 just
 about


the
 the
 job
 market
 right
 now.
 Like,
 you


know,
 let's
 say
 we
 were
 getting
 data


like
 do
 you
 think,
 you
 know,
 some
 rule


like
 we're
 in
 sort
 of
 a
 it's
 sort
 of


come
 down,
 but
 how
 close
 do
 you
 think
 we


are
 to
 the
 snowball?
 Like
 how
 urgent,


how
 far
 behind
 do
 you
 think
 the
 Fed


could
 get
 here?
 I
 remember
 when


Liberation
 Day
 happened
 and
 people
 were


wondering
 how
 bad
 it
 was
 going
 to
 get.


And
 my
 thought
 was
 that
 companies
 don't


like
 to
 change
 their
 capex
 plans
 in


April
 and
 May.
 They're
 going
 to
 try
 to


get
 through
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 and
 then


figure
 out
 2026
 and
 Q4.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 as
 they're
 doing
 that
 right
 now,


it's
 hard
 to
 think
 that
 they're
 going
 to


feel
 like
 we
 need
 outside
 of
 AI
 like
 we


need
 to
 step
 up
 investment
 and
 hiring.


>> We
 feel
 really
 good
 about
 2026
 when
 the


government's
 shut
 down
 and
 share
 prices


going
 down.


>> Exly.
 So,
 I
 worry
 a
 bit
 that
 it's
 like


we
 we
 all
 freaked
 out
 in
 April
 and
 May


and
 then
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 fine
 for
 6


months
 and
 then
 now
 is
 when
 people
 are


going to
 make
 their
 investment
 in


spending
 plans
 for
 next
 year
 and
 those


are
 going
 to
 come
 in
 lower
 than
 they
 did


a
 year
 ago
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 start
 to


see
 that
 show
 up
 in
 Q1.
 So,
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 a
 next
 week,
 next
 month


thing,
 but
 you
 know,
 could
 the


unemployment
 rate
 go
 certainly
 into
 the


high
 fours?
 Yes.
 And
 I
 think
 we
 probably


will
 get
 there.
 Does
 it
 get
 beyond
 that?


I
 don't
 know.
 But
 I
 just
 think
 3
 to
 six


months
 from
 now
 it's
 still
 going
 to
 be


worse
 than
 it
 is
 today.
 How
 concerned


are
 you
 about
 like
 um
 just
 while
 we're


here
 and
 have
 you
 some
 of
 the
 first


brands
 treeore
 some
 of
 these
 dodgy


credits
 you
 know
 Jamie
 Diamond
 used


cockroaches
 right
 like
 you
 know
 what


what's
 your
 sense
 I


>> I
 feel
 like
 the
 whole
 private
 asset


thing
 is
 that
 it
 was
 small
 in
 2008
 so


there
 weren't
 really
 any
 problems
 there


and
 then
 in
 the
 early
 2010s
 you
 had
 Zerp


and
 then
 very
 cheap
 assets
 and
 they
 had


a
 great
 decade
 of
 performance
 based
 on


that
 and
 then
 the
 asset
 class
 kind
 of


just
 kept
 getting
 bigger
 just
 because


like
 I
 don't
 know if
 there's
 a
 real


fundamental
 reason
 for
 it.
 It
 just


became
 like
 a
 thing
 that
 institutions


do.
 And
 so
 it's
 like
 are
 they
 really


underwriting
 very
 well?
 Like
 you
 look
 at


the
 stock
 prices
 of
 a
 firm
 and
 uh
 upwork


or
 all
 these
 like
 AI
 fintech
 lenders
 are


getting
 destroyed.
 And
 you've
 had
 um


that
 that's
 the
 treating
 guy
 talked


about
 Blue
 Owl.
 It's
 just
 hard
 to
 think


underwriting
 is
 really
 really
 great


right
 now.
 And
 so
 if
 if
 that
 if
 anything


worsens
 in
 the
 economy,
 I
 assume
 that


those
 guys
 are
 going
 to
 be
 in
 trouble.


>> The
 Blue
 Owl
 thing
 is
 worth
 worth
 uh


talking
 about
 more.
 And
 I
 think
 we
 have


an
 episode
 coming
 up
 that
 will
 touch
 on


that.
 Um,


>> you
 know what
 I
 should
 say?


>> We've
 been
 speaking
 with
 Bloomberg


opinion
 columnist
 Connor
 S.


>> Oh
 yes,
 [laughter]
 that's
 very


important.


>> I
 wanted
 to
 make
 sure
 I
 knew
 there
 was


one
 more
 thing
 I
 wanted
 to
 get
 in
 the


conversation
 and
 so
 I
 wanted
 to


establish
 who
 the
 guest
 we
 are
 actually


talking
 to
 was.
 I
 guess


>> Connor
 send
 person
 with
 nonzero
 chance


of
 becoming
 fed
 chair.


>> Non-zero
 chance
 of
 becoming
 fed
 chair.


>> You
 said
 that.
 That's
 [clears throat]


that's
 the
 real
 title.


>> That's
 the
 real
 title.


>> We
 should
 leave
 it
 there.
 We
 should
 go.


So,
 I
 kind
 of
 want
 McDonald's
 again,


which
 is
 bad.


>> It's
 lunch
 time.
