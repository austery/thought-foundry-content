Stevie's
 platform
 ran
 because
 it
 was
 a


really
 good
 criticism
 of
 Google.
 It
 was


a
 really
 realistic
 picturing
 of
 Amazon


including
 Jeff
 Bezos
 not
 giving
 a
 [ __ ]


about
 your
 day.


>> He
 still
 doesn't.


>> Did
 you
 write
 these
 kind
 of
 things
 all


the
 time?


>> I
 was
 fed
 up.
 I've
 been
 there
 6
 years


and
 I
 still
 couldn't
 get
 a
 platform
 out


of
 anybody.
 I
 went
 nuts
 and
 then
 a


bottle
 of
 wine
 later
 I
 told
 him
 how
 it


was.


>> But
 you
 were
 actually
 right
 in


hindsight.


>> I
 was
 right
 about
 all
 of
 it.
 But
 they


never
 said
 sorry.

 Yaggi
 is
 widely
 known
 for
 his


writing
 and
 rants
 in
 software


engineering.
 His
 blog
 post
 get
 that
 job


at
 Google
 was
 circulated
 by
 Google
 HR


for
 hiring
 purposes
 for
 15
 plus
 years


and
 his
 Google
 platforms
 rant
 written
 a


decade
 ago
 is
 still
 heavily
 cited
 across


the
 industry.
 Steve
 worked
 for
 7
 years


at
 Amazon,
 13
 at
 Google
 and
 is
 now


building
 AI
 tools
 at
 Source
 Graph.
 In


this
 rare
 conversation
 with
 Steve,
 we


cover
 the
 infamous
 Google
 platform
 rant


and
 why
 Steve
 thinks
 Google
 is
 still


terrible
 at
 building
 platforms.
 Why


Steve
 unretired
 from
 tech
 and
 coding


thanks
 AI
 tools.
 why
 Steve
 thinks
 more


dev
 should
 vibe
 go
 together
 with
 AI
 and


many
 more
 interesting
 topics.
 If
 you're


interested
 in
 how
 AI
 tools
 will
 change


how
 tech
 companies
 operate,
 how
 us


developers
 can
 keep
 up
 with
 them,
 or
 why


the
 core
 DNA
 of
 tech
 giants
 like
 Google


and
 Amazon
 seem
 to
 change
 very
 little


over
 20
 years,
 then
 this

you.

 So,
 Steve,
 just
 welcome


to
 the
 podcast.
 It's
 so
 nice
 to
 also


meet
 you
 in
 person.


>> G,
 thanks
 for
 having
 me
 again.
 So,
 the


first
 time
 I
 ever
 came
 across
 your
 blog,


it
 was
 was
 was
 it
 Steviey's
 blog
 Rants?


This
 was
 around
 2010
 because
 I
 read
 this


article
 called
 Get
 That
 Job
 at
 Google.


Back
 then
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 get
 my
 first


job
 outside
 of
 uh
 abroad
 basically
 the


first
 first
 job
 in
 the
 UK
 and
 I
 looked


for
 the
 best
 preparation
 materials
 and


the
 two
 things
 that
 helped
 me
 most
 was
 a


course
 at
 Stamford
 about
 cracking
 the


Google
 interview
 and
 your
 article
 get


that
 job
 at
 Google
 and
 what
 really
 stuck


with
 me
 this
 article
 is
 still
 up
 there


and
 I
 just
 tweeted
 recently
 that
 I
 I


think
 after
 like
 almost
 15
 years
 it's


still
 very
 relevant.
 One
 of
 the
 things
 I


really
 liked
 is
 is
 you
 put
 this


important
 takeaway
 is
 if
 you
 don't
 get


an
 offer,
 you
 may
 still
 be
 qualified
 to


work
 there.
 So,
 don't
 don't
 blow
 your


ego
 at
 all.
 What
 What
 motivated
 you
 to


write
 this
 article?


>> Getting
 turned
 down
 by
 a
 bunch
 of


places.


No,
 I
 you
 know,
 it's
 true
 that
 actually


a
 lot
 of
 my
 friends
 got
 turned
 down
 and


I
 knew
 they
 were
 good,
 right?
 So
 I
 saw


the
 false
 positives
 or
 sorry
 false


negatives
 um
 because
 they
 were
 so
 scared


of
 a
 false
 positive
 and
 they
 just
 they


were
 Google
 and
 they
 could
 just
 turn


people
 away.


>> Yeah.
 Turn
 great
 talent
 away.


>> This this
 is
 Google
 in
 in
 2008.
 So
 like


this
 was
 they
 barely
 went
 public.
 They


were
 the
 hottest
 thing
 you
 What
 did
 I


say?


>> I
 joined
 in
 2005
 actually.


>> You
 joined
 in
 2005.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 by
 the
 time
 I
 wrote
 that
 I


had
 seen
 three
 years
 of
 interviewing


there
 and
 I
 I
 knew
 what
 it
 took.
 Right.


And
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 changed
 that
 much


in
 the
 last
 15
 years
 or
 whatever.
 This


episode
 is
 brought
 to
 you
 by
 work
 OS.
 If


you're
 building
 a
 SAS
 app,
 at
 some
 point


your
 customers
 will
 start
 asking
 for


enterprise
 features
 like
 SL


authentication,
 skin
 provisioning,
 and


fine
 grain
 authorization.
 That's
 where


work
 OS
 comes
 in,
 making
 it
 fast
 and


painless
 to
 add
 enterprise
 features
 to


your
 app.
 Their
 APIs
 are
 easy
 to


understand
 and
 you
 can
 ship
 quickly
 and


get
 back
 to
 building
 other
 features.


Work
 OS
 also
 provides
 a
 free
 user


management
 solution
 called
 OKit
 for
 up


to
 1
 million
 monthly
 active
 users.
 It's


a
 drop
 in
 replacement
 for
 Alt
 Zero
 and


comes
 standard
 with
 useful
 features
 like


domain
 verification,
 rolebased
 access


control,
 bot
 protection,
 and
 MFA.
 It's


powered
 by
 Radics
 components,
 which


means
 zero
 compromises
 in
 design.
 You


get
 limitless
 customizations
 as
 well
 as


modular
 templates
 designed
 for
 quick


integrations.
 Today,
 hundreds
 of
 fast


growing
 startups
 are
 powered
 by
 work
 OS,


including
 ones
 you
 probably
 know
 like


Cursor,
 Verscell,
 and
 Perplexity.

If
 you
 want
 to
 build
 a
 great
 product,


you
 have
 to
 ship
 quickly.
 But
 how
 do
 you


know
 what
 works?
 More
 importantly,
 how


do
 you
 avoid
 shipping
 things
 that
 don't


work?
 The
 answer,
 Statig.
 Static
 is
 a


unified
 platform
 for
 flags,
 analytics,


experiments,
 and
 more.
 Combining
 five


plus
 products
 into
 a
 single
 platform


with
 a
 unified
 set
 of
 data.
 Here's
 how


it
 works.
 First,
 static
 helps
 you
 ship
 a


feature
 with
 a
 feature
 flag
 or
 config.


Then,
 it
 measures
 how
 it's
 working
 from


alerts
 and
 errors
 to
 replays
 of
 people


using
 that
 feature
 to
 measurement
 of


topline
 impact.
 Then,
 you
 get
 your


analytics,
 user
 account
 metrics,
 and


dashboards
 to
 track
 your
 progress
 over


time,
 all
 linked
 to
 the
 stuff
 you
 ship.


Even
 better,
 Static
 is
 incredibly


affordable
 with
 the
 super
 generous
 free


tier,
 a
 starter
 program
 with
 $50,000
 of


free
 credits,
 and
 custom
 plans
 to
 help


you
 consolidate
 your
 existing
 spend
 on


flags,
 analytics,
 or
 AB
 testing
 tools.

Happy
 building.
 Yeah.
 And
 and
 one
 thing


that
 you
 wrote
 about
 is
 this
 thing


called
 the
 interview
 anti-loop,
 which
 I


never
 heard
 about
 until
 then.
 What
 What


is
 it?
 And
 does
 it
 still
 exist?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 made
 it
 up,
 but
 I
 mean,
 it's


it's
 a
 phenomenon
 that
 I
 observed
 that


everybody
 knows
 about
 that
 uh
 it
 was
 the


one
 thing
 in
 that
 post
 that
 recruiting


and
 and
 HR
 were
 a
 little
 a
 little,
 you


know,
 I
 mean,
 worried
 about
 me


publishing
 it.
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 well,


there's
 no
 point
 in
 doing
 the
 post
 if
 we


don't
 talk
 about
 it,
 right?
 Let's
 let's


just
 be
 it'll
 give
 us
 some
 credibility.


Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 did
 ultimately,


right,
 which
 is
 totally
 look,
 you
 could


just
 get
 unlucky
 and
 accidentally
 get


the
 six
 people
 at
 the
 company
 who
 just


disagree
 with
 you
 the
 most
 on
 everything


technical.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 And
 it's
 just
 like
 just
 bad
 luck.


>> In
 fact,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 tech
 companies


have
 this
 policy
 or
 at least
 used
 to


have
 it
 until
 recently.
 Maybe
 they'll
 do


that.
 You
 can
 reapply
 after
 6
 months


exactly
 for
 this
 reason.


>> Yep.
 And
 I
 knew
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 who


reapply
 to
 Google
 multiple
 times.
 One
 uh


one
 guy
 I
 knew
 uh
 got
 in
 on
 his
 fifth


attempt
 and
 then
 went
 on
 to
 get
 promoted


really
 fast
 and
 rise
 up
 the
 ranks
 and


everything.
 He
 was
 very
 obviously
 a


false
 negative,
 but
 it
 just
 took
 a
 bunch


of
 tries
 to
 get
 in.
 So,
 a
 super
 critical


criticism
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 read


that
 article
 have
 is
 like,
 well,
 oh,
 if


it
 if
 this
 is
 what
 it
 takes
 into
 Google


or
 Meta
 or
 whatever,
 which
 is,
 you
 know,


it's
 it's
 my
 my
 skill
 not
 might
 matter


as
 much
 as
 the
 interviewers,
 I
 I
 don't


want
 to
 do
 that.
 Like,
 I
 really


appreciate
 that
 you
 just
 like
 you
 you


didn't
 hold
 back
 and
 you
 just
 kept
 it


real.
 But
 what
 is
 your
 take
 on
 on
 people


who
 are
 like,
 well,
 that's
 not
 fair.


It's
 not
 meritocracy,
 that
 kind
 of


stuff.


>> You
 know,
 interviewing
 is
 is
 not
 really


a
 very
 good
 signal.
 I
 I
 empathize
 with


their
 viewpoint.
 I
 in
 fact
 at
 at
 several


points
 in
 my
 career,
 I've
 sort
 of
 kind


of
 given
 up
 on
 interviewing
 and
 just


said
 like
 you
 you
 guys
 do
 it.
 You


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 think


they're
 really
 good
 at
 it
 and
 they
 think


they
 that
 they
 know
 how
 to
 do
 it
 well


and
 so
 on.
 Even
 though
 the
 statistics
 at


Google,
 they
 ran
 many
 many
 statistical


analyses
 and
 found
 that
 there
 isn't


really
 a
 lot
 of
 correlation
 between
 uh


you
 know
 how
 you
 score
 and
 whether
 you


get
 an
 offer
 and
 whether
 you
 get
 an


offer
 and
 whether
 you
 do
 well
 and
 so
 on.


And
 so
 uh
 I
 kind
 of
 lost
 faith
 in
 the


process
 a
 little
 bit.
 Um
 I
 noticed
 that


I
 was
 a
 referral
 I
 was
 a
 reference
 I


should
 say
 for
 um
 for
 a
 buddy
 of
 mine


who
 was
 imply
 who
 was
 applying
 at


anthropic


>> interviewing
 recently
 right


>> and
 I
 got
 a
 call
 right
 just
 a
 regular


reference
 call


>> reference
 call.
 Yeah


>> and
 and
 the
 person
 was
 the
 hiring


manager
 not
 like
 not
 a
 recruiter
 and
 the


hiring
 manager
 talked
 to
 me
 for
 probably


at
 least
 40
 minutes
 digging
 into
 all
 the


things
 that
 you
 don't
 pick
 up
 in
 an


interview.
 Yeah.


>> Right.
 because
 he
 recognized
 just
 just


like
 we
 do
 that
 that
 it's
 a
 interviewing


is
 a
 is
 a
 really
 flawed
 process
 and
 it's


a
 trade-off
 that
 the
 company
 has
 to
 make


between
 sort
 of
 like
 effort
 that
 they


expend
 trying
 to
 find
 good
 candidates


and
 um
 being
 being
 really
 accurate
 in


their
 assessments.
 That
 that's
 a


trade-off.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 interesting
 enough,
 you


know,
 there
 is
 some some
 people
 are


saying,
 you
 know,
 I
 guess
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 saying
 this
 is
 unfair.
 You


know,
 there's
 also
 criticism
 of
 of


coding
 interviews,
 elite
 code,
 etc.
 and


they're
 like
 why
 can't
 these
 kind


companies
 just
 ask
 me
 to
 do
 the
 work
 and


then
 plot
 twist
 some
 companies
 are
 doing


that
 these
 days
 like
 linear
 uh
 and
 some


of
 the
 formal
 companies
 are
 like
 who


have
 a
 strong
 enough
 brand
 they're
 like


we
 will
 pay
 you
 your
 like
 day
 rate
 week


rate
 and
 for
 a
 week
 you
 will
 work
 with


us
 remotely
 now
 of
 course
 and
 and
 it's


it's
 and
 you
 know
 I'm
 actually
 talking


with
 the
 engineer
 manager
 was
 was
 on
 my


team
 the
 first
 engine
 manager
 he's
 like


you
 can
 use
 AI
 tools
 like
 they're
 immune


to
 everything
 because
 you're
 actually


actually
 doing
 the
 work
 now
 the
 downside


side
 is
 it's
 a
 week
 of
 your
 life,
 right?


And
 people
 are
 like,
 well,
 I
 can't


interview
 at
 five
 different
 places.
 And


I
 feel,
 you
 know,
 there's
 all
 these


trades.
 I
 thought,
 well,
 yeah,
 but
 now


it
 is
 real
 world,
 right?
 So,
 there's


this
 spectrum
 of
 interviews.
 And
 as
 you


said,
 like
 in
 the
 end,
 just
 I
 guess
 pick


your
 poison,
 right?


>> That's
 right.
 That's
 right.
 And
 I
 know
 I


look,
 man,
 I've
 been
 in
 the
 industry
 for


30
 35
 years.
 I've
 seen
 people
 try
 all


sorts
 of
 different
 variations
 on
 trying


to
 improve
 this.
 Uh
 like,
 uh,
 the
 first


company
 I
 worked
 for
 required
 you
 to
 do


a
 six-month
 co-op
 before
 you
 could
 get
 a


full-time
 offer
 there.


>> Uh,
 what's
 that?


>> Geo
 Works.


>> GeoWorks.
 and
 they
 had
 probably
 the


highest
 hiring
 bar
 I've
 ever
 seen
 and
 uh


and
 they
 got
 acquired
 by
 Amazon
 and


Amazon
 was
 just
 blown
 away
 by
 their


hiring
 bar.


>> In
 fact,
 we
 should
 probably
 mention
 I


mean
 I
 think
 you
 and
 me
 have
 both
 seen


this
 but
 there's
 this
 like
 open
 secret


in
 the
 industry
 where
 if
 you
 go
 to
 the


website
 for
 like
 Google
 Meta
 a
 bunch
 of


big
 tech
 even
 Microsoft
 you're
 not
 going


to
 see
 software
 development
 engineer
 one


advertised
 because
 they
 fill
 all
 those


up
 with
 interns.
 So
 the
 internship
 is


actually
 a
 recruitment
 operation.
 It
 is


it
 is
 it's
 it's
 a
 really
 cutthroat
 uh


college
 hiring
 is
 super
 cutthroat
 in
 the


industry
 and
 the
 big
 companies
 like


Microsoft,
 you
 know,
 and
 Google,
 they


sort
 of
 dominate
 it.
 They
 have


>> the
 resources
 to
 build
 all
 the


relationships
 with
 the
 schools
 and
 and


it's
 Yeah.
 So
 they


>> they
 get
 the
 cream
 of
 the
 crop,
 you


know.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 then
 they
 they
 fill
 up
 an


entry
 level.


>> I'm
 really
 proud
 of
 any
 intern
 that
 goes


off
 to
 a
 startup.
 Really?


>> I
 actually
 just
 talked
 with
 uh
 someone


she'll
 she'll
 be
 on
 the
 podcast.
 She
 had


returned
 offer
 from
 Microsoft
 and
 Google


and
 she
 talked
 with
 her
 mentor
 at


Microsoft.
 It's
 it's
 a
 good
 mentor
 and


the
 mentor
 was
 saying
 like
 look
 like
 you


you
 can
 do
 big
 tech
 but
 like
 with


startups
 you
 have
 a
 very
 different
 skill


set
 and
 she
 thought
 about
 it
 for
 a
 long


time
 and
 in
 the
 end
 she
 took
 a
 she
 took


a
 risk
 and
 she
 went
 to
 KOD
 and
 she's
 now


at
 open
 AI
 actually
 but
 I
 think
 that


experience
 helped
 her
 but
 and
 she
 talked


through
 her
 her
 mentality
 and
 I
 was
 like


wow
 like
 she
 sounded
 like
 a
 like
 a
 wise


experience
 person
 and
 yeah
 I
 did
 not


expect
 it
 cuz
 you
 know
 it
 was
 like
 it


was
 paved
 and


>> I
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 too.
 I
 mean
 uh


college
 kids
 are
 savvy
 these
 days.
 they


they
 they
 know
 that
 stuff's
 like
 really


in
 flex
 and
 in
 fact
 all
 the
 stuff
 we


talked
 about
 all
 even
 many
 of
 the
 things


that
 we
 talked
 about
 in
 the
 blog
 post


that
 seemed
 timeless
 about
 getting
 a
 job


at
 Google
 uh
 getting
 a
 job
 is
 just
 hard


as
 a
 software
 engineer
 right
 now


>> the
 other
 thing
 that
 really
 resonated


with
 this
 article
 is
 as
 you
 wrote
 I'm


going
 to
 quote
 it
 when
 you
 get
 an
 offer


from
 a
 tech
 company
 you
 just
 happen
 to


squeak
 by
 and
 at
 the
 time
 when
 I
 read
 it


I
 I
 didn't
 really
 believe
 it
 from


outside
 but
 now
 that
 I
 I've
 also
 you


know
 I've
 I've
 gotten
 jobs
 I've
 I've
 a


hiring
 manager
 and
 and
 made
 so
 many


offers.
 You
 know,
 people
 who
 are
 coming


in
 and
 they're
 like, "Oh,
 I
 smashed
 the


interview."
 Actually,
 like
 out
 of
 maybe


100
 interviews
 roughly
 that
 I'd
 been
 the


hiring
 manager
 at
 Uber,
 there
 was
 like


two
 that
 was
 like
 we
 had
 more
 than
 one


person
 do
 a
 double
 thumbs
 up.
 We
 had


thumbs
 up,
 double
 thumbs
 up.
 The
 rest


were
 were
 a
 mix
 of
 like
 thumbs
 up,


thumbs
 down,
 and
 then
 we
 came
 to
 a


decision
 and
 it
 was
 like
 it
 could
 have


gone
 either
 way
 like
 when
 we
 went
 to
 the


debrief.
 So
 like
 I
 now
 really
 appreciate


I
 I
 feel
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 things
 which


it's
 hard
 to
 believe
 from
 the
 outside.


>> I
 mean
 the
 the
 best
 story
 is
 when
 I
 was


at
 Google
 I
 was
 on
 their
 you
 know
 their


hiring
 committee
 which
 is
 a
 blind
 you


know
 double
 blind.
 They
 don't
 see
 the


the
 candidates
 that
 they
 don't
 know
 the


interviewers
 who's
 doing
 it.
 They're


just
 reading
 feedback
 packets


>> and
 the
 interviewers
 don't
 bias
 each


other.
 And
 one
 day
 they
 didn't


experiment
 with
 us.
 Okay.
 Because
 we


were
 we
 were
 the
 ones
 that
 ultimately


made
 that
 decision
 that
 you
 just
 talked


about
 right
 the
 thumbs
 up
 thumbs
 down


type
 thing.
 not
 the
 interviewers.
 Google


has
 a
 separate
 committee
 that
 actually


looks
 at
 all
 the
 feedback,
 right?


>> And
 the
 recruiters
 uh
 did
 an
 exercise


with
 us
 where
 they
 presented
 a
 bunch
 of


packets,
 hypothetical
 packets,
 say
 of
 of


candidates
 uh
 who
 uh
 had
 been
 rejected


or
 or
 accepted.
 Actually,
 they
 didn't


even
 tell
 us.
 They
 just
 said,
 "These


were
 just
 a
 bunch
 of
 candidates.
 We're


going
 to
 go
 and
 do
 the
 process
 on
 them."


We
 had
 feedback
 on
 them,
 though.
 Okay.


We
 went
 through
 and
 we
 evaluated
 them


all
 and
 decided
 we
 were
 going
 to
 not


hire
 60%
 of
 them.
 All right.


>> Have
 you
 figured
 this
 one
 out
 yet?


No,
 not
 yet.


>> We
 were
 reviewing
 our
 own
 packets.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 we
 voted
 not
 to
 hire
 60%
 of


ourselves.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.
 And
 it
 was
 a
 very
 sobering


realization.
 And
 the
 next
 week
 or
 two


was
 like
 the
 best
 time
 to
 apply
 to


Google
 cuz
 we
 were
 just
 like,
 "Come
 on


through."
 Right.
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 nuts.


>> Well,
 cuz
 60%
 is
 almost
 a
 coin
 toss.
 A


coin
 toss
 is
 50%.
 You're
 a
 little
 bit


better.


>> Right.
 Right.
 And
 so,
 I
 mean,
 the
 whole


I
 don't
 know
 the
 whole
 process
 is
 also


so
 heavily
 biased
 towards
 whether
 you


like
 the
 person
 or
 not.
 you
 know
 a
 lot


of
 the
 decisions
 made
 in
 the
 first
 10


seconds
 they
 say
 and


>> yeah
 but
 but
 you
 know
 my
 takeaway
 and
 I


think
 different
 people
 take
 different


things
 but
 the
 reason
 that
 really
 helped


me
 not
 just
 at
 that
 time
 when
 I
 got
 this


first
 job
 in
 the
 UK
 but
 actually
 I
 read


it
 later
 when
 for
 example
 I
 later


applied
 to
 Facebook
 I
 I
 narrowly
 didn't


but
 I
 didn't
 get
 it
 and
 actually
 that


rejection
 helped
 me
 get
 that
 position
 at


Uber
 which
 all
 of
 these
 are
 are
 just


cutthroat
 and
 like
 what
 what
 I
 took
 away


from
 it
 is
 this
 is
 how
 the
 the
 process


is
 you
 might
 not
 like
 it.
 But
 you
 can


either
 just,
 you
 know,
 complain
 or
 or
 or


think
 is
 it's
 unjust
 or
 you
 can
 know


it's
 unjust
 and
 you
 know
 that
 you
 just


need
 to
 try
 hard
 and
 when
 you
 do
 get
 it,


you
 know,
 don't
 take
 it
 for
 granted.


>> So,
 how
 did
 getting
 rejected
 by
 Facebook


help
 you
 get
 a
 job
 at
 Uber?
 Cuz
 if
 it's


helpful,
 I'll
 go
 get
 rejected
 at


Facebook.


>> What
 what
 was
 helpful
 is
 I
 I
 did
 a
 bunch


of
 time
 preparing
 for
 Facebook.
 Like


like
 it
 was
 very
 clear
 at
 the
 time
 that


they
 actually,
 you
 know,
 send
 me


materials
 and
 the
 preparation
 did
 not
 go


to
 waste.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I
 learned
 how
 to


do
 the
 algorithmical
 coding
 bigo.
 Like
 I


knew
 some
 of
 that
 before,
 but
 I
 really


refreshed
 it
 uh
 on
 on
 the
 spot
 on
 on


Facebook
 for
 the
 system
 design.
 I


thought
 I
 nailed
 it
 cuz
 I
 heard
 the


question
 before
 and
 I
 just
 like
 drew
 up


like
 it
 was
 like
 design
 Instagram
 like
 I


got
 this,
 you
 know,
 no
 conversation
 with


the
 person.
 And
 later
 I
 I
 kind
 of
 got


some
 feedback
 on
 like
 you
 know
 what
 I


didn't
 do.
 And
 so
 by
 the
 time
 I
 got
 to


Uber,
 I
 actually
 heard
 that
 like
 again,


not
 many
 people
 got
 double
 thumbs
 up.


But
 in
 hindsight,
 I
 kind
 of
 got
 the
 I


did
 get
 like
 two
 or
 three
 double
 thumbs


up
 cuz
 I
 have
 practice.
 And
 also
 I
 think


the
 other
 thing
 is
 at
 Uber
 at
 the
 time,


this
 was
 Amsterdam.
 So
 and
 then
 London
 a


lot
 of
 people
 knew
 how
 to
 interview.


Amsterdam
 Uber
 struggled
 to
 have
 people


who
 you
 know
 understood
 these


interviews.
 So
 I
 guess
 I
 stood
 out


because
 I
 prepared
 a
 year
 earlier.
 So


the
 preparation
 does
 not
 go
 to
 waste.
 So


>> yeah,
 the
 preparation
 is
 so
 important.


so
 important.
 Um,
 but
 boy,
 what
 do
 you


prepare
 for
 now?
 Like
 I've
 got
 a
 buddy


who's
 out
 interviewing
 right
 now.
 He's


just
 very
 senior
 engineer
 and
 uh
 he
 says


that
 the
 teams
 are
 all
 asking
 they
 they


want
 somebody
 to
 come
 teach
 them
 AI.


That's
 what
 everyone's
 doing.
 So
 they


want
 someone
 who
 knows
 AI
 because
 they


don't.
 That's
 the
 theme
 right
 now.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 what
 do
 you
 prepare
 for?


>> Well,
 I
 just
 talked
 with
 someone
 again


she'll
 be
 on
 the
 podcast,
 Janvi,
 who


interviewed
 46
 AI
 companies.
 She's
 the


the
 the
 engineer
 who
 who
 went
 to
 Koda


became
 an
 AI
 engineer
 there.
 So
 she


interviewed
 with
 46
 and
 she
 said
 it's
 a


mess
 and
 you
 know
 this
 is
 like
 for


mid-level
 so
 like
 we're
 not
 talking


staff
 level
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 are
 still


doing
 the
 usual
 lead
 code
 style


interviews.


>> Uh
 and
 then
 they
 might
 ask
 a
 few
 things


about
 AI
 and
 she
 said
 that
 there
 is
 one


new
 type
 of
 project
 that
 she
 actually


really
 likes
 is
 a
 project
 especially
 for


AI
 you
 know
 build
 something
 based
 on
 AI


and
 she
 says
 she
 loves
 it
 because
 she


can
 actually
 show
 off
 what
 she's
 capable


of
 doing.
 It
 seems
 it's
 a
 mess.
 I
 don't


think
 people
 know
 what
 to
 do.
 And
 you


know,
 I
 don't
 think
 even
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 know
 what
 AI
 engineer
 is.
 We


we'll
 we'll
 we'll
 get
 into
 this,
 but
 but


before
 before
 we
 go,
 so
 you
 wrote
 the


Get
 That
 Job
 at
 Google
 in
 2008.
 And
 10


years
 later,
 you
 wrote
 another
 one


called
 Get
 That
 Job
 at
 Grab.
 You
 you


were
 at
 Grab.
 Now,
 you
 would
 think
 uh


that
 the
 these
 two
 are
 are
 kind
 of


connected,
 but
 Get
 That
 Job
 at
 Grab
 was


an
 more
 of
 an
 article
 about
 the
 job


market
 at
 the
 time
 in
 in
 in
 2018.
 you


wrote
 I
 I'll
 quote
 because
 something
 str


very very
 strange
 is
 going
 on
 in


industry.
 It
 started
 maybe
 a
 couple


years
 ago
 and
 it
 escalated
 a
 lot
 around


a
 year
 ago
 and
 then
 what
 completely


crazy
 about
 6
 months
 ago.
 Uh
 what


happened
 is
 this
 global
 demand
 for


software
 engineers
 completely
 out
 of


supply
 and
 I
 think
 it
 might
 be
 happening


because
 we
 missed
 a
 market
 correction


sometime
 in
 the
 past
 5
 years.
 It
 was
 the


article
 was
 basically
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 heads


up
 saying
 the
 market
 is
 really
 hot.
 And


now
 that
 I
 read
 it
 back,
 I
 I
 was
 a
 bit


of
 amazed
 because
 you
 wrote
 this
 one
 or


two
 years
 before
 anyone
 mentioned
 it.
 It


was
 happening.
 It
 was
 heating
 up
 to
 be


the
 hottest
 job
 market
 and
 you
 know
 it


it
 it
 we
 saw
 it
 in
 2021.
 It
 was
 the


peak.
 You
 saw
 this
 and
 you
 were
 pretty


much
 advertising
 it
 to
 anyone
 who
 who


was
 actually
 listening
 to
 whatever
 you


were
 you're
 preaching.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 mean
 you
 they're
 they're


the
 early
 warning
 system.
 the
 recruiters


are
 that
 that
 will
 tell
 you
 what's
 going


on
 with
 the
 market,
 right?
 Because


they're
 directly
 in
 touch
 with
 the


hiring
 managers
 who
 are
 the
 ones
 who


are,
 you
 know,
 in
 touch
 with
 the
 people


with
 the
 budgets
 who
 are
 deciding
 what


the
 company's
 going
 to
 focus
 on.
 And
 so


the
 recruiters,
 if
 you're
 in
 touch
 with


your
 recruiter
 network,
 right,
 you
 know,


kind
 of
 what
 the
 trends
 are
 and
 all
 that


stuff.
 And
 so
 I
 started
 noticing
 that


the
 world
 was
 running
 out
 of
 engineers.


>> Yeah.


>> That's
 fundamentally
 what
 was
 happening


back
 then.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 like
 you


also
 I
 think
 some
 people
 were
 externally


it
 looked
 a
 bit
 surprising
 because
 you


were
 you
 were
 doing
 great
 at
 Google
 and


you
 went
 to
 this
 scale
 up
 grabb
 I
 mean


they're
 growing
 fast
 but
 I
 think
 some


people
 are
 thinking
 why
 is
 TV
 going


after
 Google
 to
 grab
 why
 why
 were
 you


going
 by
 the
 way?


>> Wow.
 Well well
 you
 know
 I
 mean
 GeoWorks,


Amazon
 Google
 all
 really
 similar
 in
 a


lot
 of
 ways.
 Uh
 you
 know
 GeoWorks
 was


was
 more
 like
 device
 software
 but
 still


right.


>> Yeah.
 uh
 you
 know
 grab
 grab
 I
 had
 a


buddy
 from
 Google
 who
 was
 CTO
 there


right
 Theo
 and
 Vas
 Lacis
 and
 he
 was
 like


man
 this
 is
 an
 adventure
 you
 got
 to
 come


so
 I
 started
 chatting
 with
 them
 and


realized
 they
 were
 on
 just
 this
 I
 mean


that
 Southeast
 Asia
 in
 general
 is
 just


this
 incredible
 productivity
 explosion


and
 it
 just
 it
 seemed
 fun
 right


>> and
 it
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 actually
 really


fun
 it
 was
 and
 then
 co
 killed
 it
 so
 you


know


>> back
 back
 then
 like
 at
 the
 this
 get
 that


job
 job
 grab
 you
 did
 describe
 how
 the


market
 was
 was
 was
 really
 heating
 up
 and


you
 know
 some
 things
 happened
 co
 but


what
 what
 you
 wrote
 here
 is
 so
 so
 now


there's
 a
 gut
 of
 an
 investor
 money
 has


creating
 a
 lot
 of
 startups
 a
 lot
 of


startups
 including
 some
 very
 big
 ones


and
 they're
 gobbling
 up
 all
 the
 energy


left
 on
 the
 planet
 and
 now
 it's
 a
 fight


>> yeah
 it
 got
 worse
 after
 that


>> yeah
 I
 I
 was
 ask
 like
 how
 how
 did
 you


see
 it
 play
 out
 and
 how
 does
 it
 continue


all
 this
 today
 because
 I
 feel
 today
 we


might
 see
 something
 similar
 in
 a


different
 area
 right


>> yeah
 I
 mean
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 investment


uh
 coming
 in
 for
 sure
 it's
 coming
 in
 hot


um
 right
 we
 went
 through
 a
 we
 went


through
 a
 huge
 spike
 right
 after
 I


posted
 that
 because
 um
 shortly


afterwards
 was
 COVID,
 right?
 Two
 years


later,
 we
 had
 the
 stimulus
 package
 and


that
 gave
 everybody
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 and


that
 was
 like
 tons
 of
 startups
 appeared


because
 of
 that.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 oh
 so
 much
 founders


>> and
 so
 great
 time
 to
 be
 a
 remote


engineer
 basically,
 right?


>> Uh
 then
 the
 stimulus
 package
 and
 the


stimulus
 money
 went
 away
 and
 um
 things


started
 to
 kind
 of
 crash
 and
 then
 AI


came
 out
 and
 everybody
 got
 really


uncertain
 and
 so
 it
 kind
 of
 dipped
 a


little.
 It's
 it
 has
 dipped
 I
 think
 if


you
 just
 look
 at
 Indeed's
 report
 you
 can


see
 jobs
 have
 dipped
 pretty
 heavily


since
 their
 peak
 in
 2021


or
 2022
 um
 but
 we
 also
 see
 a


productivity
 explosion
 on
 its
 way
 like
 a


boom
 of
 jobs
 coming
 so
 uh
 it
 goes
 up
 and


down
 but
 yeah
 I
 think
 uh
 at
 the
 time
 at


at
 that
 time
 in
 2018
 the
 market
 was
 uh


was
 showing
 signs
 that
 it
 was
 going
 to


and
 that's
 what
 look
 that's
 what


everybody
 wants
 they
 want
 to
 predict


what's
 going
 to
 happen
 not
 just
 so
 that


they
 know
 what
 stocks
 to
 buy
 right
 but


also
 So,
 you
 know,
 how
 to
 make
 the
 right


decisions
 for
 their
 companies,
 right,
 or


their
 careers.
 And
 right
 now,
 I
 think


you
 and
 I
 both
 agree
 that
 things
 are


kind
 of
 headed
 back
 up
 right
 now.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 and
 and
 we
 we
 will
 get


into
 that,
 but
 I
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 a


second
 time
 that
 So,
 the
 first
 time
 I
 I


I
 came
 across
 your
 blog.
 I
 didn't
 really


even
 connect
 the
 name
 with
 the
 face
 back


then
 was
 get
 a
 job
 at
 Google.
 The
 second


time
 was
 was
 a
 few
 years
 later
 which
 was


this
 Google
 platform
 rant
 which
 was


published
 on
 uh
 on
 Google+,


right?
 Yeah.
 I I
 so
 it
 was
 it
 was
 an


internal
 facing
 document.
 Apparently
 you


wrote
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 or
 or
 just
 like


rants
 or
 like
 meant
 for
 Google
 internal


only
 and
 somehow
 it
 was
 set
 to
 anyone


could
 read
 it
 on
 the
 internet
 and
 hacker


news
 jumped
 on
 it
 and
 as
 soon
 as
 it
 went


out
 you
 know
 people
 archived
 it
 as
 well.


Uh,
 first
 of
 all,
 how
 did
 this
 rant
 came


along?
 Because
 this
 rant
 has
 been
 so


referenced.
 It's
 it's
 it's
 now
 I
 think


on
 on
 GitHub
 as
 well,
 Stevie's
 platform


rant
 because
 it
 was
 a
 really
 good


criticism
 of
 Google.
 And
 not
 just
 that,


but
 it
 was
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 really
 really


realistic
 like
 picturing
 of
 of
 Amazon


including
 Jeff
 Bezos
 not
 giving
 a
 [ __ ]


about
 your
 day
 which
 I
 think
 you
 know


people
 were
 like


>> he
 still
 doesn't
 you
 know.


>> Yeah.
 But
 it
 it
 it
 just
 felt
 very
 real


and
 raw
 and
 clearly
 it
 was
 I
 understand


it
 wasn't
 meant
 for
 public
 consumption.


But
 you
 know
 like
 a
 did
 you
 write
 this


these
 kind
 of
 things
 all
 the
 time
 like


cuz
 we
 only
 saw
 this
 one
 thing
 and
 and
 I


I've
 heard
 that
 you
 you
 had
 a
 history
 of


just
 internally
 just
 keeping
 it
 really


real.


>> I
 had
 other
 ones
 internally.
 Sure.
 None


of
 them
 were
 quite
 that
 um
 I
 guess


accusatory
 or
 whatever.
 I
 mean
 like
 I


was
 I
 was
 really
 taking
 Google
 to
 task


because
 I
 was
 fed
 up.
 I'd
 been
 there
 six


years
 and
 I
 still
 couldn't
 get
 a


platform
 out
 of
 anybody,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 um


>> like like
 Google
 to
 ship
 a
 proper


platform
 that
 that


>> even
 internally
 like
 like
 the
 code


search
 team
 didn't
 want
 to
 give
 me
 an


API.
 They
 like
 it's
 inconceivable
 today.


You
 you'd
 give
 somebody
 a
 rest
 API
 to


your
 stuff,
 right?
 You
 just
 That's
 the


way
 we
 think
 today.
 Yeah.
 Well,
 outside


of
 Google,
 inside
 of
 Google,
 who
 knows?


They're
 just
 not
 really
 big
 on
 internal


um
 services.
 They're
 just
 like
 use
 our


product.


>> Yeah.
 It
 drove
 me
 nuts.
 Completely
 nuts.


I
 went
 nuts.
 And
 then
 a
 bottle
 of
 wine


later,
 I
 uh
 Yeah.
 told
 him
 how
 it
 was.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 let
 let's
 recall
 some
 of
 that


that
 that
 part
 cuz
 I'm
 I'm
 going
 to
 link


it
 obviously
 so
 people
 can
 read
 it.
 But


first,
 you
 started
 summarizing
 on
 what


Amazon
 did,
 right?
 And
 and
 what
 you


observed
 throughout
 your
 time,
 right?


You
 were
 early
 Amazon,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 Earlyish.
 Yeah.
 I
 was
 I
 got
 there


in
 late
 1998.
 It
 was
 pretty
 small
 back


then.
 We
 were
 in
 one
 building
 in
 uh


downtown
 Seattle,
 just
 a
 three-story


building.


>> Wow.
 That's
 it.


>> A
 four-story
 building
 of
 which
 we


occupied
 three
 floors,
 I
 guess,
 is
 it?


>> And
 uh
 yeah,
 uh
 there
 was
 just
 one
 data


center
 at
 the
 time.
 And
 it
 was
 just
 a


very
 small
 It
 already
 had
 a
 cult-like


sort
 of
 feel
 to
 it,


>> right?
 An
 electric
 feel.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 mean,
 a
 sense
 that
 uh
 that
 that
 there


was
 something
 really
 magical
 going
 on.


So,
 so
 was
 this
 still
 the
 the
 bookstore


uh
 part
 or
 or
 was
 it
 already
 expanding


beyond
 books?


>> We
 uh
 when
 I
 joined
 we
 already
 had
 uh


music
 and
 I
 think
 we
 were
 just
 launching


video.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 think
 we
 had
 just
 just


brought
 our
 tabs.
 It
 was
 really
 early


on.
 I
 have
 to
 go
 back
 and
 look
 at
 the


history.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> And
 then
 like
 you
 know
 you
 said
 that


that
 basically
 Jeff
 Bezos
 mandated


platforms
 APIs.
 What
 did
 you
 do
 there?


You
 know,
 it's
 interesting
 because
 I


everybody
 thinks
 that
 there's
 a
 real


memo.
 The
 memo
 was
 I
 there
 was
 Jeff


wouldn't
 write
 an
 actual
 memo,
 right?
 Um


why
 the
 [ __ ]
 would
 he
 do
 that?
 Uh
 he


just
 tells
 people
 stuff
 and
 it
 happens.


Uh
 but
 uh
 the
 customer
 service


organization
 in
 particular
 was
 I
 I
 was


in
 customer
 service
 tools
 at
 the
 time.
 I


was
 I
 may
 have
 been
 running
 customer


service
 tools
 at
 the
 time.
 Bezos
 would


sit
 with
 us
 every
 week
 in
 a
 meeting
 and


we
 would
 look
 at
 the
 top
 10
 reasons
 that


customers
 were
 contacting
 us.
 Right.


He'd
 want
 to
 know
 why
 are
 these


customers
 still
 contacting
 us
 saying


they're
 getting
 triple
 charge
 for
 their


books
 as
 a
 translator?
 That
 kind
 of


thing,
 right?


>> Number
 one
 was
 always
 where's
 my
 stuff,


right?


>> Yeah.


>> Customer
 service
 had
 a
 really


interesting
 need.
 I
 it
 may
 have
 been


Jeff,
 you
 know,
 I've
 never
 thought
 about


this
 before,
 but
 it
 may
 have
 been
 Jeff's


sort
 of
 affinity
 for
 customer
 service,


wanting
 to
 be
 the
 Earth's
 most
 customer-


ccentric
 company
 that
 led
 him
 down
 this


path
 of
 forcing
 people
 to
 open
 up
 their


APIs
 because
 the
 customer
 service
 team


kept
 saying,
 "We
 can't
 make
 any
 changes


to
 Obos,
 you
 know,
 our
 web
 server


because
 that's
 their
 code.
 We
 can't
 get


into
 the
 supply
 chain
 code.
 We
 can't
 get


into
 the
 fulfillment
 center
 code.
 The


customer,
 we
 can't
 help
 the
 customer."


And
 Bezos
 was
 like,
 "All
 right,
 tell
 you


what,


>> right?
 I'm
 going
 to
 blast
 anybody


standing
 in
 the
 way
 of
 that.
 And
 what


that
 turned
 into
 was,
 well,
 you
 need
 to


provide
 something
 to
 the
 customer


service
 technical
 team
 that's
 not
 them


going
 and
 linking
 against
 your
 code
 and


trying
 to
 get
 it
 to
 run
 locally
 in
 some


different
 environment,
 right?


>> Which
 is
 what
 they
 were
 doing
 with
 this


awful
 C++
 code.
 So
 yeah,
 so
 that's


that's
 kind
 of
 the
 origin
 story.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 this
 was
 like
 around


early
 2000s,
 right?
 Like
 like
 before,


you
 know,
 we
 even
 had
 things
 like


services
 or
 microservices.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 back
 then
 the
 services
 were


things
 like
 they
 were
 proprietary


protocols
 like
 um


>> Corba
 uh
 like
 uh
 Pipco
 and
 Tallaria
 and


the
 pub
 sub
 things
 and
 they
 were
 all


really
 nasty
 binary
 formats
 and


>> uh
 and
 there
 was
 this
 possibility
 to
 do


rest
 and
 so
 right
 it
 had
 been
 invented


at
 the
 time
 but
 everybody
 was
 kind
 of


poo
 pooing
 it
 saying
 no
 nobody
 really


kind
 of
 understood
 it
 from


>> no
 type
 safety
 no
 protocol


>> yeah
 yeah
 it
 took
 years
 but
 turned
 out


yeah
 that's
 what
 you
 need
 you
 need
 an


API
 and
 that
 was
 that
 was
 the
 the


orientage
 origin
 of
 my
 rant
 too,
 right?


Which
 was
 I
 talked
 about
 Amazon
 does


stuff
 mostly
 wrong.


>> You
 you
 this
 is
 how
 you
 started
 your


memo.
 So
 that
 that
 was
 actually


fascinating
 to
 read.
 I
 think
 it
 was


clear
 that
 you
 were
 you
 were
 on
 Google's


side,
 right?
 Like
 even
 though
 you're


trashing
 Google,
 it
 it
 it
 very
 clearly


came
 through
 that
 you
 actually
 like


wanted
 to
 like
 shake
 things
 up
 like


hello
 like
 like
 the
 memo
 when
 I
 read
 it


felt
 like
 hey
 like
 we
 should
 be
 better


than
 Amazon.
 Here's
 all
 the
 reasons
 and


here's
 the
 things
 that
 they're
 doing


better
 and
 it's
 not
 that
 hard.
 We
 we we


just
 need
 to
 be
 do
 that
 well
 and
 then
 we


will
 be
 better,
 right?


>> I
 mean,
 it
 made
 sense,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I
 I
 just
 I
 just
 felt
 like
 we
 were


good
 at
 everything
 else.
 We
 were
 good
 at


a
 lot
 of
 stuff.
 Google
 was


extraordinarily
 good
 at
 a
 lot
 of
 things


that
 Amazon
 had
 no
 clue
 how
 to
 do


really.
 And
 it
 took
 Amazon
 years
 to


catch
 up
 to
 Google
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 things


like


>> So,
 let's
 talk
 about
 that.
 What
 were
 the


things
 that
 Google
 was
 just
 really
 good


at?
 Like
 Google
 had
 one
 service
 called


Stubby.
 I
 think
 I
 even
 mentioned
 it
 in


the
 post
 called Called
 uh
 called
 Stubby


or
 sorry
 Chubby.
 Chubby
 was
 the
 locking


service.


>> Chubby
 and
 Stubby.
 They
 went
 together.


>> The
 locking
 service.


>> Yeah,
 the
 locking
 distri
 a
 distributed


locking
 ser.
 Those
 are
 not
 easy
 to


implement.
 Okay.
 We're
 talking,
 you


know,
 Paxos
 times
 10,
 you
 know,
 make


sure
 the
 thing
 stands
 up
 all
 the
 time.


It
 had
 seven
 nines
 of
 availability,


which
 is
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It
 was
 like


basically
 30
 seconds
 of
 downtime
 every


10
 years.


>> Oh,


>> okay.
 It
 was
 a
 very
 reliable
 service.
 Oh


wow.
 Okay,
 that
 was
 one
 example.
 Five


nines
 is
 hard
 to
 get
 to.


>> Amazon
 seven.
 Yeah,
 five
 is
 almost


insane.
 Seven
 is
 just
 like
 what?
 So
 that


was
 just
 one
 example.
 Big
 table
 early
 on


they
 had
 like
 free
 basically
 like


unlimited
 no
 SQL
 storage
 with
 some


pretty
 good
 query
 facilities
 for


everybody
 and
 the
 map
 produce


infrastructure.
 Google
 invented
 it,
 you


know,
 and
 on
 and
 on
 and
 on,
 right?


>> So
 like
 really
 really
 good
 hardcore


engineering
 problems
 solved
 in
 a
 in
 a
 in


a
 like
 way
 that
 is
 like
 just
 tough
 tough


to
 do.
 I
 was
 very
 impressed.
 I
 I
 slapped


myself
 like
 my
 forehead
 sometimes
 when
 I


was
 like
 I'd
 see
 some
 of
 the
 stuff
 they


did.
 I
 got
 there
 and
 I'm
 like
 why
 didn't


I
 think
 of
 this
 like
 I
 had
 this
 game


that
 I
 had
 a
 custom
 RPC
 protocol
 when
 I


looked
 at
 Google's
 which
 is
 now
 gRPC.
 It


was
 called
 protocol
 buffers
 and
 stubby


back
 then.


>> You
 look
 at
 it
 and
 you're
 like
 oh
 wow


it's
 a
 forward
 compatible
 protocol.
 I


can
 add
 stuff
 to
 it
 without
 breaking
 it


but
 it's
 binary
 and
 high
 performance
 and


it
 was
 beautiful.
 It
 is
 beautiful.


Surprised
 no
 more
 people
 don't
 use
 it
 to


be honest.
 So
 yeah,
 they
 did
 a
 lot
 of


things
 really
 well,
 but
 they
 didn't
 do


platforms
 well
 at
 all.
 It
 wasn't
 part
 of


their
 DNA.
 They
 just
 didn't
 get
 it.


>> And
 and
 it
 was
 they
 didn't
 do
 internal


or
 external
 or
 neither.


>> Neither.


>> Neither.


>> Neither.
 Neither.


>> And
 then
 so
 you
 wrote
 this
 rant
 which


again
 like
 I
 think
 if
 you're
 listening


to
 this
 you
 need
 to
 read
 that
 rant
 that


it
 is
 like
 one
 of
 the
 best
 things
 I've


read.
 It's
 also
 very
 entertaining
 by
 the


way.
 Um
 what
 was
 the
 the
 impact?
 Cuz


obviously
 you
 sent
 it
 internally,
 it
 now


leaked
 externally.
 So
 clearly
 you
 know


people
 were
 making
 fun
 of
 fun
 of
 Google.


Did
 it
 achieve
 that
 that
 shakeup
 effect?


And
 and
 you
 know,
 how
 high
 did
 this


thing
 get?
 Like
 I'm
 pretty
 sure
 it
 must


have
 gotten
 pretty
 high.


>> Well,
 I
 mean,
 Google
 had
 a
 very
 open


culture,
 so
 it
 got
 brought
 up
 at
 the


next
 TGIF,
 right?


>> Thank
 Thank
 god
 it's
 Friday,
 right?
 It's


Google's
 iconic
 Friday
 meeting.
 It's


like
 all
 hands-ish.


>> I
 remember
 uh
 Ben,
 the
 guy
 that
 was
 in


charge
 of
 our
 uh
 our
 fulfillment
 center,


not
 filling
 centers,
 sorry,
 our
 our
 data


centers
 at
 the
 time,
 he
 was
 uh
 he
 stood


up
 there
 and
 said,
 "Well,
 you
 know,
 we


all
 read
 the
 rant."
 Uh,
 so
 you
 know
 they


got
 a
 kick
 out
 of
 it,
 right?
 But
 you


know,
 Vicandotra
 was
 pissed.
 I
 mean,
 he


was
 really
 really
 mad,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> Because
 I
 had
 like
 told
 him
 he
 had
 an


ugly
 baby
 and
 very
 very
 very
 loudly
 and


publicly
 and


>> Yeah.


>> You
 know,
 and
 uh
 and
 I
 had
 used
 his
 ugly


baby
 to
 do
 it.


>> This
 this
 was
 a
 developer
 saw
 google.com


baby
 or
 or
 something
 else?


>> No,
 Google
 Plus.


>> Oh,
 Google+.


>> I
 called
 Plus
 ugly.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 and
 you


know
 and
 he
 was
 like
 uh
 he
 was
 really


gunning
 for
 the
 the
 head
 spot
 at
 the


time
 and
 he
 had
 planted
 the
 seed
 of
 fear


in
 Larry
 Page.
 He
 was
 like
 Facebook's


going
 to
 kill
 us.
 Facebook's
 going
 to


kill
 us.
 They're
 going
 to
 kill
 us.


Right.
 We
 had
 to
 have
 a
 Facebook


>> which
 was
 stupid
 for
 many
 reasons.
 Some


of
 Oh,
 so
 I
 I
 I
 I'll
 tell
 this
 again.


I'll
 I'll
 say
 this
 again.


>> That
 that
 blog
 rant
 that
 that
 famous


rant
 was
 actually
 part
 two
 of
 an
 11-part


series
 that
 I
 had
 meticulously
 planned


out
 and
 I
 never
 finished
 because
 I


accidentally
 published
 the
 second
 one


externally.
 And
 the
 the
 implications


were
 actually
 so
 big
 that
 I
 was
 kind
 of


like
 in
 hiding
 for
 a
 while.


>> But
 yeah,
 no,
 I
 was
 actually
 picking


apart
 plus
 dimension
 by
 dimension
 and


platforms
 was
 just
 one
 of
 the
 dimensions


where
 it
 was
 failing.


>> But
 you
 were
 actually
 right
 in


hindsight.


>> I
 was
 right
 about
 all
 of
 it,
 but
 they


never
 said
 sorry.
 I
 was
 also
 right
 about


not
 getting
 into
 publication
 ads.
 I
 was


right
 about
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 at
 Google,


but
 I'm
 not
 very
 good
 at
 convincing


people
 that
 I'm


>> So,
 so
 tell
 me
 that
 story
 because
 you've


you've
 said
 you've
 told
 me
 this
 story


once
 in
 in
 the
 newsletter
 and
 we
 we


mentioned
 it
 super
 briefly.
 You
 killed


publication
 ads
 and
 this
 was
 like
 as
 as


I
 remember
 like
 what
 happened
 is
 you


joined
 Google
 and
 then
 what
 did
 you
 do


the
 first
 time?


>> I
 went
 around
 to
 all
 the
 projects.
 I
 was


allowed
 to
 pick
 whatever
 I
 wanted
 and
 I


picked
 print
 ads
 because
 I
 thought
 it


sounded
 like
 a
 cool
 challenge.
 I
 became


a
 domain
 expert
 over
 the
 next
 six


months.
 learned
 everything
 there
 was
 to


know
 about
 magazines
 and
 newspaper


publication
 ads
 in
 the
 United
 States
 and


concluded
 that
 we
 were
 never
 going
 to


make
 a
 dime
 that
 all
 of
 them
 hated
 us


and
 blamed
 us
 for
 their
 declining


revenues
 and
 they
 wouldn't
 want
 to
 talk


to
 us
 and
 we
 were
 evil


>> and
 I
 wrote
 it
 up
 as
 a
 big
 decision
 tree


I
 said
 we
 could
 try
 this
 we
 tried
 this


it
 didn't
 work
 tried
 this
 the
 whole


thing
 I
 mapped
 out
 the
 entire
 decision


tree
 of
 everything
 you
 could
 do


>> and
 they
 said
 well
 what
 about
 illegal


stuff
 and
 I
 was
 like
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


entertain
 any
 of
 that
 stupid
 stuff
 all


right
 it
 was
 like
 they
 didn't
 put
 that


in
 writing
 but
 you
 know
 it
 was
 like
 what


if
 we
 just
 what
 if
 we
 just
 sucked
 up
 the


phone
 book
 type
 stuff.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 so
 like
 you
 know
 I
 declined
 and
 and


then
 they
 got
 mad
 and
 they
 sent
 it
 to


other
 teams
 and
 the
 other
 teams
 failed


and
 came
 back
 to
 me
 for
 my
 postmortem.


>> So
 So
 they
 they
 tried
 to
 make
 it
 work.


>> They
 tried
 again
 in
 Mountain
 View
 and


then
 they
 tried
 in
 England


>> and
 they
 couldn't
 do
 it
 because
 I
 was


right.
 I
 never
 got
 so
 much
 as
 a
 I'm


sorry
 or
 a
 thank
 you
 or
 anything
 like


that.
 No.


>> Yeah.
 But
 like
 you
 concluded
 this
 is
 not


worth
 it.
 So
 you
 you
 well
 first
 of
 all


you
 said
 like
 if
 you
 if
 you
 were
 you
 you


wouldn't
 do
 it
 and
 then
 you
 moved
 on
 to


the
 next
 thing
 and
 then
 they
 failed
 to


retweet
 well
 like
 sounds
 like
 twice


>> I
 did
 make
 a
 proposal
 in
 the
 post


postmortem
 which
 was
 very
 similar
 to


what
 ultimately
 turned
 into
 group
 on.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 So
 you
 know
 I
 mean
 it
 was
 it


wasn't
 like
 complete
 shooting
 it
 down.


You
 could
 do
 one
 thing
 but
 I
 said
 you


will
 need
 a
 sneaker
 network
 of
 like


8,000
 people
 somehow
 right


>> which
 was
 what
 Groupon
 ultimately
 did.


>> It's
 fun
 to
 be
 right.
 It
 sounds
 like
 you


know
 you
 just
 like
 you
 know
 you
 did
 the


best
 that
 you
 could
 you
 you
 gave
 the


best
 and
 then
 you
 also
 like
 sounds
 like


you
 were
 like
 look
 if
 you
 want
 to
 try
 it


like
 like
 do
 it
 but
 like
 I
 don't
 believe


like
 I
 believe
 this
 this
 will
 not
 work.


I
 believe
 we
 could
 try
 this
 and
 then


just
 leave
 it
 at
 that
 right
 like
 you


know
 you
 you
 did
 what
 you
 believe
 then


>> what
 do
 you
 think
 happened
 to
 plus
 like


I
 I
 remember
 you
 know
 Google
 launched


wave
 which
 kind
 of
 like
 died
 down
 pretty


quickly.
 it
 it
 was
 supposed
 to
 be
 the


next
 email
 that
 that
 was
 the
 first
 time


I
 was
 like
 I
 I
 remember
 like
 this
 early


2010s
 Google
 could
 not
 do
 anything
 wrong


and
 every
 every
 time
 they
 launched


something
 I
 was
 like
 wow
 this
 is
 the


next
 big
 thing
 they
 launched
 Google
 app


engine
 I
 was
 like
 it's
 the
 the
 coolest


thing
 and
 I
 on
 boarded
 and
 it
 was
 so


cheap
 it
 was
 ridiculously
 cheap
 later
 I


figured
 out
 why
 because
 they
 were


subsidizing
 it
 but
 uh
 Google
 wave
 was


the
 first
 one
 where
 I
 remember
 in
 all


the
 magaz
 all
 the
 online
 portals
 tech


crunch
 etc
 was
 like
 Google
 has
 replaced


email
 and
 we're
 like
 oh
 wow
 Google
 has


replaced
 email
 and
 you
 tried
 it
 out
 and


didn't
 work.
 And
 then
 Google+
 came
 along


and
 I
 think
 we
 understood
 from
 the


outside,
 not
 not
 as
 Googlers
 as
 like


that
 Google
 was
 trying
 to
 really
 take
 on


Facebook
 and
 if
 they
 didn't
 succeed,
 you


know,
 Facebook
 would
 win
 and
 I
 don't


think
 we
 from
 the
 outside
 it
 seemed
 like


it
 was
 kind
 of
 kind
 of
 going.
 Yeah,
 it


was
 it
 was
 it
 was
 pretty
 pretty
 ugly,


but
 then
 it
 just
 kind
 of
 stopped.
 You


were
 on
 the
 inside
 like
 how
 how
 did
 this


play
 out?
 Cuz
 I
 think
 we
 we've
 heard


there's
 like
 books
 about
 like
 Facebook's


went
 all
 in
 wartime.
 and
 they
 were


working,
 you
 know,
 hard
 and
 and
 and
 they


actually
 saw
 this
 as
 a
 major
 threat
 and


it
 re
 it
 energized
 them.
 What
 do
 you


think
 might
 have
 been
 wrong
 on
 there
 or


like
 how
 much
 vantage
 point
 did
 you
 then


have
 on
 this?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 was
 there,
 you
 know,
 I
 I


talked
 to
 people
 who
 were
 in
 the
 heat
 of


it,
 you
 know,
 and
 um
 like
 Wave
 was


targeting
 a
 space
 that
 ultimately
 got


solved
 by
 Slack.


>> Yep.


>> Slack
 was
 the
 right
 form
 factor
 and
 Wave


wasn't.
 And
 when
 I
 saw
 Wave,
 I
 was


totally
 unimpressed,
 but
 it
 was
 like


they
 had
 cast
 a
 spell
 over
 everybody
 and


I
 didn't
 see
 what
 I
 didn't
 get
 it
 right.


But
 um
 but
 I
 got
 slack
 instantly,
 right?


We
 all
 did.
 So
 um
 it
 it
 was
 very


similar.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 uh
 Google
 had


trouble
 struggle
 struggled
 to
 find
 the


right
 form
 factor.
 This
 was
 why
 I
 wrote


that
 11
 part
 series.
 It's
 because
 I
 knew


that
 if
 they
 basically
 acted
 right
 then


and
 got
 Reddit
 just
 took
 them
 just


bought
 Reddit.
 Okay.
 Yeah.


>> And
 took
 over
 that
 sort
 of
 that
 social


network,
 they
 would
 have
 had
 something.


They
 would
 have
 had
 something.
 This
 is


far
 long
 before
 Reddit
 was
 in
 the
 top
 10


in
 the
 US.
 Right.
 This
 was
 right.
 This


Reddit
 was
 hot,
 but
 only
 like
 tech


geeks,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Dig
 was
 also
 big
 back
 then.


>> Dig.
 Yeah.
 Before
 pre
 pre-
 digs,
 you


know,
 you
 know,
 blow
 up
 or
 whatever.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 So
 I
 wanted
 them
 to
 I
 wanted


do
 Google
 to
 start
 take
 either
 build


build
 a
 Reddit
 that
 was
 done
 kind
 of


like
 slightly
 better
 uh
 because
 you
 know


Reddit
 evolved
 uh
 and
 even
 they
 want
 to


change
 it
 or
 or
 or
 something
 fix
 a
 lot


of
 things
 but
 it
 had
 to
 be
 different


from
 Facebook
 or
 people
 wouldn't
 be
 able


to
 migrate
 because
 the
 network
 effect


fundamentally
 right
 and
 Google
 just
 I


mean
 it's
 so
 weird
 man
 companies
 are


like
 people
 they're
 like
 human
 beings


they
 like
 they
 like
 they
 just
 they
 make


decisions
 and
 the
 decisions
 can
 be
 just


absolutely
 terrible
 and
 everyone
 around


them
 knows
 it
 and
 they're
 all


embarrassed
 and
 they
 try
 to
 tell
 the


company
 and
 the
 company's
 like,
 "Don't


tell
 me
 what
 to
 do."


>> Yeah.


>> Sometimes
 feels
 like
 it.
 So,
 so
 now


looking
 back
 so
 many
 years
 later,
 you


know,
 you've
 left
 Amazon
 like
 I
 don't


know
 like
 like
 10
 plus
 years,
 even
 more.


Same
 with
 Google.
 How
 do
 you
 think


Amazon


>> 20
 years?


Yeah.
 How
 do
 you
 think
 both
 Amazon
 and


Google
 have
 changed?
 But
 also,
 in
 what


sense
 have
 they
 not
 changed?


>> I
 think
 Amazon's
 changed
 way
 more
 than


Google.
 You're
 the
 first
 person
 ever
 to


ask
 me
 this,
 so
 thank
 you.
 Amazon
 has


improved
 dramatically
 in
 almost
 every


possible
 way
 that
 you
 could
 improve.


>> Really?


>> Yeah.
 Amazon
 has
 always
 executed
 better


than
 anybody
 on
 earth,
 but
 they
 found
 a


way
 to
 do
 it
 without,
 you
 know,
 having


all
 of
 the
 flaws
 that
 I
 mentioned
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 my
 post,


>> right?


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 they've
 it's
 really
 it's
 it's
 quite


nice
 now
 and
 and
 people
 that
 I
 know
 who


work
 there
 are
 are
 pretty
 pretty


satisfied
 and
 uh
 uh
 they're
 doing
 well


and
 they
 still
 execute
 well.
 They
 they


they're
 a
 company
 that
 makes
 good


decisions
 by
 and
 large,
 just
 like
 Apple.


Of
 course,
 they
 fall
 on
 their
 face
 once


in
 a
 while.
 What
 company
 doesn't?
 Yeah.


Right.


>> Google
 has
 not
 changed
 since
 the
 [ __ ]


day
 I
 joined.


End
 of
 story.


>> So,
 re
 recently,
 someone
 at at
 Google


was
 was
 asking
 me
 about
 like
 what
 what


do
 I
 think
 about
 Google's
 developer


story?
 And
 I
 said
 like,
 do
 you
 want
 to


be
 want
 me
 to
 be
 honest?
 I
 said,


developer
 what?
 And
 my
 example
 that
 I


showed
 this
 person
 is
 Flutter
 versus


React
 Native.
 Now,
 React
 Native
 is
 about


10
 full-time
 people
 at
 Facebook
 and
 and


a
 few
 a
 few
 other
 uh
 in
 the
 core
 team


and
 and
 maybe
 a
 few
 other
 people
 from


some
 other
 companies,
 maybe
 like
 15


person,
 but
 Facebook
 invests
 like
 10


full-time
 people.
 Mhm.


>> And
 and
 if
 you
 go
 to
 the
 the
 showcase


page
 of
 of
 React
 Native,
 which
 is,
 you


know,
 where
 where
 you
 show
 you you


immediately
 see
 logos,
 Meta,
 Microsoft,


Amazon,
 I
 think
 they
 they
 they
 have


someone
 big
 just
 like
 flagship
 flagship


apps
 and
 then
 you
 have
 oh,
 and
 you
 have


Shopify,
 you
 have
 like
 all
 all
 these
 big


companies
 and
 you
 know,
 you
 will
 find


the
 blog
 post.
 Shopify
 says
 why
 we
 went


all
 in
 on
 React
 Native,
 why
 we
 have


thousands
 of
 of
 developers
 working
 on


React
 Native
 and
 and
 you
 have
 all
 these


case
 studies.
 Uh,
 React
 Native
 is
 is


inside
 of
 Meta's
 Facebook
 app.
 It's


inside
 Instagram.
 It
 doesn't
 run
 the


whole
 thing,
 but
 it's
 in
 there,


obviously,
 their
 ads
 app.
 And
 then
 you


go
 to
 Flutter
 page.
 Now,
 Flutter
 has
 at


least
 50
 full-time
 people,
 so
 five
 times


as
 many.
 And
 you
 see
 some
 small
 Google


apps
 on
 the
 top.
 It
 looks
 nice,
 but
 you


scroll
 down
 and
 it's
 it
 looks
 like
 an


intern
 made
 that
 page.
 Like,
 you
 have


some
 random
 Chinese
 app
 that
 you
 never


heard
 about.
 And
 then
 BMW,
 which
 is
 a


brand
 that,
 you
 know,
 it's
 somewhere
 in


the
 very
 bottom.
 and
 and
 like
 there's
 no


apps
 there
 there's
 no
 big
 apps
 there's


no
 big
 logos
 outside
 of
 and
 even
 even


for
 the
 Google
 logos
 there
 there
 flutter


is
 not
 used
 in
 any
 of
 their
 flagship


apps
 so
 I'm
 like
 startups
 who
 are


deciding
 which
 ones
 to
 use
 just
 based
 on


this
 they
 will
 go
 for
 react
 native
 it


actually
 has
 the
 street
 cred
 and
 and
 I


asked
 someone
 at
 Meta
 like
 how
 did
 you


guys
 pull
 this
 off
 like
 with
 a
 smaller


team
 you
 you
 executed
 clearly
 what
 I


think
 is
 is
 better
 in
 terms
 of
 like
 you


got
 the
 big
 customers
 you're
 building


for
 big
 he
 said
 like
 at
 meta
 everything


is
 about
 impact
 and
 the
 React
 Native


team
 the
 first
 thing
 they
 did
 is
 is


drive
 impact.
 They
 got
 React
 Native


inside
 you
 know
 the
 the
 biggest
 apps


into
 into
 Instagram,
 Facebook
 etc.
 and


then
 the
 rest
 came
 because
 you
 know


Shopify
 is
 like
 well
 if
 you
 know
 it's


used
 inside
 of
 Facebook
 with
 I
 don't


know
 how
 many
 thousands
 of
 developers
 we


can
 use
 it
 as
 well.


>> Yeah
 I
 mean
 uh
 look
 uh
 Google
 can't


afford
 to
 be
 disintermediated
 in
 the


mobile
 space.
 They
 can't
 afford
 to
 just


become
 the
 plumbing
 that
 people
 can
 swap


out
 and
 they
 there's
 that's
 always
 been


an
 existential
 threat
 for
 them.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 the
 Facebook
 application
 is
 a


platform
 itself
 and
 you
 can
 write


applications
 inside
 of
 it.
 And
 so
 like


if
 you're
 writing
 for
 the
 Facebook


platform
 and
 you're
 the
 New
 York
 Times


or
 whatever,
 like
 who
 cares
 if
 you're


running
 on
 Android
 or
 iOS
 and
 that's


Google's
 worst
 nightmare,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> And
 that's
 why
 Facebook
 in
 the
 age
 of
 AI


hasn't
 laid
 off
 the
 React
 Native
 team


because
 that's
 their
 basically,
 hey,
 you


don't
 own
 Android,
 we
 do,
 right?
 that's


their
 play
 and
 so
 Google
 you
 you'll


they'll
 never
 give
 up
 on
 it.
 What


happened
 was
 unfortunately
 uh
 Flutter
 is


not
 from
 the
 Android
 team
 and
 that


pissed
 the
 Android
 team
 off
 because


Android
 is


>> politics


>> Android
 was
 a
 uh
 an
 acquisition
 and


>> the
 guy
 that
 ran
 it
 was
 uh
 very


particular
 about
 uh
 them
 being
 sort
 of


uh
 in
 charge
 of
 their
 own
 destinies
 and


not
 beholden
 to
 anyone
 else
 and
 he
 kept


Android
 sort
 of
 running
 the
 way
 that


they
 ran
 it
 inside
 and
 they
 made
 all
 the


decisions
 and
 the
 buck
 stopped
 there.


Flutter
 came
 along
 and
 sort
 of


threatened
 their
 dominance
 as
 the


platform
 and
 it
 pissed
 them
 off
 and


Google
 has
 been
 sort
 of
 unable
 to


reconcile
 those
 things
 even
 since
 2018


when
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 this
 problem
 2017.


>> Yeah.
 One
 of
 my
 biggest
 question
 marks


about
 Google
 and
 why
 they
 have
 not


changed
 this
 is
 around
 their
 cloud


platform.
 So
 when
 I
 worked
 at
 Microsoft


well
 I I
 like
 to
 say
 Microsoft
 it
 was


Skype.
 They
 just
 bought
 Skype
 and
 they


left
 us
 alone.
 So
 it
 it
 was
 Skype
 and


then
 when
 they
 turned
 Microsoft
 I
 kind


of
 I
 was
 like
 all
 right
 this
 is
 I
 don't


like
 that that
 much
 but
 uh
 they
 gave
 us


a
 mandate.
 They
 said
 you
 need
 to
 use


Azure
 and
 we
 were
 one
 of
 the
 first
 like


we
 were
 the
 new
 purchase
 so
 they
 just


dumped
 it
 on
 us.
 Azure
 was
 not
 ready
 and


I
 was
 sitting
 next
 to
 the
 data
 team
 the


Skype
 data
 team
 who
 had
 all
 our
 our
 data


centers
 and
 they're
 moving
 over
 and


they're
 saying
 it's
 just
 a
 a
 huge
 pain.


It's
 like
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 this
 but


but
 it
 was
 for
 actually
 Balmer
 was


forcing
 it
 on
 them
 and
 and
 it
 was
 this


blood,
 sweat
 and
 tears
 and
 eventually


they
 move
 but
 but
 what
 I've
 seen
 is
 like


over
 time
 you
 know
 now
 when
 I
 talk
 with


with
 teams
 at
 Microsoft
 like
 what
 are


you
 guys
 using?
 Obviously
 they're
 using


Azure
 or
 Bing
 might
 not
 be
 using
 it
 but


it's
 AWS
 is
 using
 AWS
 and
 then
 I
 talk


with
 teams
 at
 Google
 what
 are
 you
 guys


using
 or
 like
 hold
 on
 why
 are
 you
 not


using
 GCP?
 Well,
 it
 doesn't
 scale.
 It


doesn't
 have
 the
 things
 we
 need.
 And


like
 how
 can
 you
 be
 gunning
 to
 be
 number


two
 or
 or
 one
 day
 maybe
 number
 one
 cloud


platform
 if
 your
 own
 company
 comes
 up


with
 excuses?
 And
 I
 I
 never
 understood
 I


I
 I
 tried
 to
 ask
 this
 like
 on
 back


channels
 from
 people
 working
 at
 GCP.


They
 always
 come
 up
 with
 excuses.
 But
 I


don't
 understand
 how
 is
 it
 that
 it's
 the


only
 cloud
 company
 that
 does
 not
 use
 its


own
 cloud
 service
 for
 their
 their


flagship
 service
 for
 the
 flagship


products.
 I
 think
 it's
 all
 just
 who's


been
 the
 most
 successful
 at
 marketing


and
 convincing
 people
 that
 they're
 using


their
 own
 clouds.
 But
 they
 are
 all
 all


currently
 huffing
 their
 own
 farts.


Amazon
 doesn't
 use
 AWS.


>> No,
 I
 I I
 heard
 I
 heard
 so


>> Sable
 ain't
 AWS.


>> Okay.


>> I
 mean
 like
 right
 for
 the
 retail
 side,


for
 the
 ad
 side,
 I
 mean
 like
 of
 course


they
 they
 want
 you
 to
 use
 AWS,
 but
 all


the
 core
 the
 core
 core
 core
 stuff
 and


they
 haven't
 migrated,
 man.
 So
 like
 it's


all
 fru
 as
 far
 as
 I'm
 concerned,
 right?


It's
 all
 like


>> I
 think
 it
 might
 have
 changed
 cuz


because
 it
 is
 less
 they
 had
 a
 name
 for


the
 old
 stuff
 and
 I
 think
 more
 and
 more


things
 moving
 over.


>> That's
 fair
 and
 never
 bet
 against


Amazon.
 AWS
 may
 have
 actually
 graduated


to
 the
 point
 where
 they
 can
 actually
 use


it
 internally.


>> Uh
 the
 hurdles
 for
 Google
 were


insurmountable.


>> So
 so
 maybe
 this
 is
 fair
 by
 the
 way.
 So


so
 maybe
 this
 criticism
 is
 not
 entirely


fair
 because
 what
 I
 understand
 is
 their


infrastructure
 is
 way
 bigger
 and
 more


complex
 than
 like
 anything
 else.
 It's


sort
 of
 fair
 to
 say
 that
 Google's
 cloud


runs
 off
 top
 on
 top
 of
 Google's


infrastructure
 which
 which
 actually
 does


scale
 the
 biggest
 in
 the
 world
 bigger


than
 Amazon.


>> Well,
 one
 one
 thing
 that
 I
 am
 wondering


because
 because
 I'm
 still
 waiting
 for


what
 will
 the
 tool
 or
 platform
 be
 that


Google
 releases
 that
 their
 internal
 tool


teams
 use
 it
 and
 they're
 like,
 "Oh,
 we


have,
 you
 know,
 100,000
 or
 like
 50,000


or
 100,000
 software
 developers
 inside


Google
 using
 it.
 You
 should
 use
 it."
 You


know,
 Microsoft
 did
 this
 with
 like


Visual
 Studio


>> non-
 Googler.


>> Uh,
 no.
 No,
 no,
 no.
 Some
 some
 Google


tool.
 And
 I'm
 thinking
 could
 we
 see
 this


maybe
 with
 with
 some
 AI
 tools,
 you
 know,


like
 AI
 coding
 tools,
 etc.
 Like
 could


they
 finally
 do
 this?
 Or
 maybe
 this
 is


not
 not
 a
 Google
 way
 to
 do
 it.
 They'll


be
 like,
 "All
 right,
 we
 have
 our


superior
 internal
 tools
 and
 we
 will


build
 an
 external
 thing,
 you
 know,
 we


have
 Borg,
 we'll
 we'll
 build
 Kubernetes


for
 everyone
 else."


>> I
 don't
 I
 just
 don't
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


think
 Google
 understands
 developers.
 I


don't
 think
 they
 ever
 did.


>> Ironic.


>> It's
 it's
 it's
 it's
 really
 closely


related
 to
 their
 their
 blind
 spot
 around


platforms,
 right?
 If
 you
 don't
 get


platforms,
 it's
 because
 you
 don't


understand
 developers.


>> It's
 just
 ironic
 because
 Google
 like
 no


company
 or
 few
 companies
 treat


developers
 as
 good
 as
 Google
 does,


right?
 In
 terms
 of


>> Yeah.
 And
 few
 companies
 few
 companies


have
 built
 a
 platform
 as
 incredible


internally
 as
 Google's
 is
 uh
 you
 know
 at


at
 the
 sort
 of
 foundation
 level.


>> Yeah.
 You
 unretired
 you
 retired
 for
 for


for
 some
 time
 and
 then
 you
 unretired


because
 of
 well
 initially
 source
 graph


but
 but
 then
 also
 AI.
 what
 what what


made
 you
 kind
 of
 come
 back
 into
 the


game?


>> It's
 not
 a
 binary
 thing.
 I've
 been


gradually
 unretiring
 if
 that
 makes
 any


sense.
 Um
 and
 it's
 because
 uh
 at
 first
 I


was
 like,
 you
 know what,
 I'm
 I'm
 really


climbing
 the
 walls.
 I
 really
 want
 to


just
 go
 work
 with
 some
 people.
 And
 so


that's
 you
 know
 that's
 where
 I
 wound
 up


at
 Source
 Graph.
 Like
 that
 was
 familiar


ground,
 right?
 That
 was
 Google
 code


search
 for
 for
 everyone
 else.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 then
 shortly
 afterwards


the
 AI
 AI
 showed
 up
 and
 I
 I
 was
 like


that
 was
 like
 the
 next
 step
 up
 is
 oh
 man


maybe
 I
 better
 get
 back
 into
 coding


again
 for
 a
 while
 because
 this
 looks


really
 different.
 So,
 so
 fun
 fact
 is


last
 time
 we
 talked
 about
 three
 years


ago,
 you
 were
 head
 of
 engineering
 at


source
 graph
 and
 actually
 people
 told
 me


at
 source
 graph
 you
 came
 in,
 you
 made


some
 changes
 which
 were
 actually
 like


pretty
 well
 received
 but
 like
 you
 shook


up
 you
 introduced
 where
 people
 could


drop
 there


>> that
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 Yeah.


>> And
 then
 next
 thing
 I
 know
 is
 like,
 oh,


you
 you
 wrote
 this
 like
 you
 write
 about


everything,
 which
 you
 know
 if
 we
 we'll


link
 some
 more
 more
 things,
 but
 I
 I
 love


writing
 it.
 But
 you
 wrote
 about
 like,


oh,
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 stepping
 down
 as
 heavy


engineering
 because
 I'm
 going
 back
 to


coding,
 which
 was
 not
 what
 I
 would
 have


expected
 again
 from
 just


>> and
 and
 I
 view
 that
 as
 a
 as
 another
 step


in
 me
 sort
 of
 coming
 out
 of
 retirement,


right?
 Because
 I
 had
 given
 up
 on
 coding.


>> I
 just
 it
 wasn't
 worth
 it
 anymore.
 Kent


Beck
 had
 given
 up
 on
 coding.
 a
 lot
 of a


lot
 of
 my
 old
 buddies
 and
 colleagues,


right?
 You
 know,
 there's
 just
 like


environment
 setup
 is
 just
 over
 the
 top


these
 days,
 right?
 And,
 you
 know,
 just


building
 a
 simple
 web
 app,
 you
 probably


have
 to
 use,
 you
 know,
 25
 different


frameworks,
 many
 of
 which
 have


incompatible
 competing,
 you
 know,


whatevers.


>> Yeah.
 And
 as
 soon
 as
 you
 update
 to
 the


latest
 React
 thing,
 all
 the
 routers


breaks
 and
 you
 have
 to
 relearn.


>> Who
 wants
 that?
 And
 so,
 at
 some
 point,


you
 get
 tired
 of
 it
 and
 you're
 just


like,
 I'm
 done,
 man.
 I
 can't.
 This
 isn't


it's
 not
 worth
 it.
 Right.


>> And
 AI
 completely
 turned
 that
 on
 his


head.
 And
 I
 saw
 it
 coming
 as
 soon
 as the


chat
 GBT
 came
 out.
 I
 was
 like,
 oh,
 wow.


look,
 you
 can
 write
 an
 actual
 function


that's
 reasonably
 good,
 right?
 And
 then


when
 40
 came
 out,
 then
 I
 was
 able
 to


project
 forward
 and
 with
 exponential


growth
 and
 say,
 uh-oh,


>> uhoh,
 you
 know,
 it's
 coming,
 right?
 And


so,
 so
 now
 I'm
 getting
 sort
 of
 like
 more


and
 more
 fired
 up
 with
 each
 passing


month.

 One
 thing
 that


has
 we've
 talked
 a
 lot
 in
 the
 industry


and
 everyone's
 talking
 about
 it
 is
 how


AI
 will
 first
 and
 foremost
 like
 I
 think


like
 experienced
 developers,
 we
 can
 get


there,
 but
 how
 will
 it
 impact
 junior


developers?
 and
 you
 wrote
 this
 again


controversial
 title
 the
 death
 of
 the


junior
 developer
 but
 interesting
 enough


when
 you
 read
 closer
 a
 lot
 of
 your


articles
 are
 like
 this
 by
 the
 way
 like


there's
 a
 title
 which
 you
 think
 like
 oh


it's
 it's
 the
 end
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 are


wakeup
 calls
 to
 me
 when
 I
 read
 it


properly
 it
 wasn't
 like
 oh
 there's
 no


more
 junior
 developers
 it
 was
 a
 wakeup


call
 saying
 hey
 if
 you're
 a
 junior


developer
 you
 need
 to
 get
 your
 your


stuff
 together
 quickly
 and
 ch
 like
 like


whatever
 the
 junior
 developers
 before


you
 were
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 work
 for
 you.


So
 like
 what
 what what
 what
 does
 what
 is


it
 that
 you've
 seen
 and
 like
 did


something
 inspire
 you?
 Did
 you
 like
 see


some
 some
 some
 young
 titans
 who
 were


actually
 just
 doing
 great
 with
 with


these
 tools?


>> Man,
 you've
 hit
 on
 a
 question
 that
 is


just
 so
 fundamental
 and
 foundational
 to


our
 industry
 right
 now.
 that's
 shaking


the
 industry
 that
 question
 you
 know
 and


the
 answer
 is
 I
 mean
 the
 shortest
 way


you
 know
 that
 I
 would
 think
 about
 it
 is


um
 AI
 is
 not
 easy
 to
 use
 and
 the
 more


senior
 you
 are
 the
 more
 likely
 it
 is


you're
 going
 to
 notice
 when
 it's
 being


bad
 when
 the
 AI
 has
 become
 naughty
 right


it's
 just
 common
 sense
 yeah


>> and
 the
 AI
 is
 very
 naughty
 and
 and
 in
 in


very
 subtle
 and
 insidious
 ways
 right


>> and
 even
 as
 they
 get
 smarter
 and
 they


are
 getting
 exponentially
 smarter
 and


they
 will
 be
 frighteningly
 smart
 within


a
 year
 they
 will
 still
 I
 mean
 software


is
 always
 bigger
 than
 they
 are
 right
 and


they
 will
 still
 make
 silly
 do
 silly


things
 and
 and
 that
 and
 it's
 just
 going


to
 bias
 towards
 more
 senior
 people
 but


it's
 not
 really
 seniority
 we
 learned


it's
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 junior
 and


senior
 it's
 really
 more
 about


>> who
 is
 demonstrating
 the
 ability
 to
 work


well
 with
 AI
 and
 get
 good
 outcomes
 in


software
 and
 that
 could
 be
 anyone
 who


could
 be
 a
 product
 manager
 so
 I
 think


there's
 a
 big
 shakeup
 coming
 where
 the


roles
 change
 and
 and
 everybody
 becomes


more
 focused
 on
 what
 they're
 building


instead
 of
 like
 who's
 who's
 building
 it


and
 uh
 have
 you
 have
 you
 heard
 the


collapsing
 the
 stack
 stuff
 from
 uh
 Scott


Bellski.
 Uh


>> can
 you
 refresh
 the
 null?


>> Basically
 like
 there's
 a
 line
 of


thinking
 that
 we've
 over
 specialized
 and


everybody's
 like
 incredibly
 domain


expertise
 specialized
 and
 you
 got
 these


senior
 engineers
 at
 Google
 who
 know


exactly
 how
 the
 fuse
 file
 system
 drivers


work
 for
 every
 version
 of
 the
 Linux


kernel,
 right?


>> Like
 we
 don't
 have
 that
 anymore.
 We


don't
 need
 that.
 That's
 that's
 stupid.


That's
 going
 away.
 But
 all
 the


specialization
 is
 going
 away
 because
 AI


is
 democratizing
 all
 of
 it.
 You
 can't


hide
 that
 knowledge.
 This
 this
 is


interesting
 because
 I
 just
 talked
 with


someone
 I
 I
 think
 a
 week
 or
 two
 ago


about
 how
 what
 has
 changed
 in
 software


engineering
 even
 before
 AI
 and
 and
 what


has
 changed
 back
 in
 early
 2000s
 when
 you


looked
 at
 software
 developers
 you
 had


the
 Java
 developer
 you
 had
 the
 net


developer
 you
 had
 the
 the
 Python
 you
 had


and
 these
 were
 different
 people
 it
 was


the
 Java
 developer
 would
 not
 do
 net
 even


though
 they're
 pretty
 similar
 so
 there


was
 a
 and
 and
 we
 we
 so
 on
 the
 back
 end


languages
 were
 specialized
 fast
 forward


to
 even
 before
 AI
 like
 2015
 or
 2018
 18


when
 you
 know
 we
 had
 a
 big
 hiring
 for


like
 when
 when
 I
 worked
 at
 Uber
 we
 no


longer
 like
 Uber
 was
 seen
 as
 like
 oh


this
 like
 completely
 changed
 we
 didn't


care
 if
 you
 did
 Java
 orn
 net
 or
 or


whatever
 you
 come
 you
 know
 you
 know
 one


of
 those
 languages
 you'll
 pick
 up


whatever
 we're
 doing
 and
 at
 some
 point


when
 my
 team
 was
 doing
 go
 python
 nodejs


and
 what
 else
 we
 were
 we're
 still
 doing


some
 some
 something
 else
 but
 we're
 doing


all
 of
 it
 so
 like
 we
 started
 to
 have


less
 specialization
 so
 I
 wonder
 if
 this


thing
 started
 earlier
 and
 maybe
 AI


actually


makes
 it
 more
 more
 viable
 that
 now
 until


now
 we've
 had
 you
 know
 a
 front-end


engineer
 would
 not
 touch
 back
 and
 they


might
 understand
 the
 concept
 of
 APIs
 but


now
 they
 actually
 can
 in
 fact
 when
 when


the
 product
 manager
 can
 actually
 create


pull
 requests


>> yeah
 we
 see
 that
 now
 right
 like
 uh
 at


source
 graph
 one
 of
 our
 UI
 designers
 uh


is
 now
 sending
 pull
 requests
 for
 the
 UI


instead
 of
 asking
 engineers
 to
 do


>> and
 are
 they
 are
 they
 any
 good
 or


they're
 actually
 decent
 or


>> yeah
 I
 mean
 uh
 look
 I
 mean
 it's
 all
 over


the
 map
 it's
 just
 like
 uh
 I
 believe
 this


is
 the
 new
 role
 for
 junior
 developer
 ers


>> is
 they're
 going to
 be
 mentoring
 the


next
 layer
 down
 of
 nontechnical
 or


technical
 adjacent
 people
 who
 are
 now


starting
 to
 contribute
 PRs,
 right?


>> And
 they'll
 be
 the
 ones
 who
 are
 like


helping
 them
 fix
 the
 security
 issues
 or


whatever
 else
 they
 have
 with
 their


basically
 teaching
 junior
 developers


because
 they're
 still
 trained
 engineers.


Yeah.
 Right.
 So
 they
 can
 teach
 like
 a
 UX


designer
 or
 product
 manager
 what
 are
 the


right
 questions
 to
 ask
 the
 AI
 about
 your


thing
 to
 know
 whether
 you're
 done
 or
 not


yet.
 Right.
 You
 know,
 give
 you
 those


kinds
 of
 skills.
 I
 I
 I
 like
 this
 because


I
 think
 we
 all
 know
 things
 will
 change.


I
 think
 we're
 we're
 all
 struggling
 to


like
 put
 the
 finger
 exactly.
 I
 mean,
 you


have
 you
 clearly
 have
 a
 bunch
 of


conviction,
 which
 which
 I
 think
 is
 great


cuz
 I
 think
 you
 need
 conviction
 in
 in
 in


this
 areas
 of
 going
 around
 them.
 And
 I


have
 been
 so
 you
 know,
 you
 work
 at


source
 graph.
 You
 you
 guys
 are
 are
 are


heavily
 using
 your
 AI.
 In
 fact,
 you
 you


have
 your
 own
 AI
 tool,
 but
 you've
 been


using
 the
 existing
 tools
 from
 from
 from


the
 beginning.
 And
 most
 of
 the
 stories


I'm
 hearing
 so
 far
 about
 a
 non-technical


person
 doing
 technical
 stuff
 is
 at
 AI


companies
 where
 they're
 surrounded
 by


these
 people.
 Winster
 uh
 co-founder
 CEO


of
 Varun.
 He
 he
 told
 me
 that
 they
 have
 a


I
 think
 it
 was
 a
 salesperson
 who
 had
 a


sales
 tool
 and
 they
 just
 kind
 of


viodated
 it
 with
 with
 Windsurf.
 It
 it


had
 no
 state.
 It
 was
 super
 simple
 thing.


You
 know,
 it's
 not
 complicated,
 but
 that


person
 did
 it.
 Yeah.


>> And
 I
 wonder
 if
 you
 know
 we
 might
 be


these
 type
 of
 like
 kind
 of
 AI
 or
 just


very
 sharp
 environments
 like
 lead
 the


path
 of
 what
 the
 kind
 of
 legacy
 or


larger
 companies
 will
 be
 in
 10
 years.


>> Yeah,
 absolutely
 man.
 We're
 seeing
 it


everywhere.
 I
 mean
 we're
 seeing


companies
 where
 uh
 marketing
 teams
 are


writing
 their
 own,
 you
 know,
 outbound,


you
 know,
 campaign
 software,
 you
 know,


uh
 we're
 seeing
 uh
 uh
 product
 teams,
 you


know,
 bypass
 vendors.
 So
 they
 don't
 have


to
 reup
 with
 a
 renewal
 or
 a
 contract


from
 some
 crummy
 vendor
 software
 because


they
 wrote
 their
 own
 and
 had
 somebody


from
 engineering
 just
 vet
 it
 and
 be


like,
 "Okay,
 yeah,
 you
 can
 make
 these


two
 changes
 and
 then
 you
 can


>> I
 I I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 a
 little
 bit
 about


that
 because
 I
 I'm
 a
 bit
 skeptical
 about


that.
 Do
 you
 have
 you
 seen
 like
 a


specific
 examples
 of
 what
 they
 replace?"


Cuz
 for
 example,
 with
 work
 day,
 you're


not
 going
 to
 replace
 that
 which
 has
 all


the
 compliance,
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 state,


a
 lot
 of
 regulation,
 a
 lot
 of
 ongoing


maintenance
 like
 that
 that
 that
 is
 not


what
 you're
 going
 But
 what
 are
 the


things
 that
 you've
 seen?
 Well,
 this
 was


a
 So,
 imagine
 a
 company
 with
 a
 lot
 of


really
 bad
 actors
 coming
 in
 and
 trying


to
 crawl
 over
 the
 site
 and
 find
 fan
 bad


ways
 to
 uh
 to
 basically
 siphon
 money


out.


>> So,
 they
 have
 many
 many
 different
 kinds


of
 teams
 that
 are
 looking
 at
 different


kinds
 of
 fraud
 and
 different
 kinds
 of


attacks.


>> And
 there
 are
 lots
 of
 kind
 of
 bespoke


tools.
 And
 so,
 you
 get
 into
 this
 long


tale
 of
 little
 vendors
 that
 offer
 these


crummy
 tools
 that
 are
 really
 expensive


for
 very
 simple,


>> very
 vertical,
 domain
 specific.
 And
 so,


the
 product
 team
 at
 this
 one
 company
 was


like,
 "Screw
 it.
 We're
 going
 to
 ask
 AI


to
 build
 it.
 We'll
 give
 it
 the
 specs.
 we


know
 what
 it
 wanted
 to
 do
 and
 they
 built


it,
 you
 know,
 in
 Python,
 you
 know,
 and


so
 it
 wasn't
 production
 software.
 It
 was


software
 that
 they
 use
 as
 their


investigation
 trying
 to
 find
 bad
 actors.


>> Nevertheless,
 it
 saved
 them
 from
 a
 reup


with
 a
 contract
 that
 was
 rather


expensive
 and
 it
 gave
 them
 they
 were


happy,
 right?
 You
 know,
 they
 had
 full


control
 over
 the
 software.
 They
 could


make
 it
 do
 whatever
 they
 wanted
 at
 that


point.
 So,
 they
 were
 starting
 and
 this


is
 just
 one
 of
 probably
 a
 dozen
 examples


I
 could
 give
 you,
 but
 we're
 seeing


>> but
 let's
 let's
 carry
 on
 that
 thought


because
 you
 and
 I
 built
 software.
 We
 we


we've
 seen
 the
 internal
 tool
 that
 the


team
 has
 built.
 In
 fact,
 you
 know,


Google
 is
 famous
 for
 building
 all
 the


internal
 tools.
 What
 is
 the
 the
 next


step?
 So
 like
 can
 we
 just
 move
 because


we
 know
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 right
 as


experienced
 people
 who
 are
 working


software.
 So
 what
 what's
 happening
 next


year
 when
 when
 there's
 like
 more


functionality
 to
 be
 added?
 How
 far
 might


we
 be
 able
 to
 take
 it
 and
 what's
 going


to
 be
 the
 breaking
 point?
 Cuz
 this


happened
 before
 before
 AI,
 right?
 Like


one
 internal
 developer
 wrote
 it
 and
 at


some
 point
 it
 it
 becomes
 like
 just
 a


pain,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 Look,
 I
 predict
 I
 I'm
 going
 to
 go


right
 on
 the
 record
 and
 I'm
 going
 to


predict
 that
 there
 is
 a
 new
 role,
 a
 new


category
 of
 roles
 that's
 going
 to
 emerge


that
 are
 the
 Winston
 Wolves
 that
 are


going
 to
 come
 in
 and
 fix
 [ __ ]
 that
 you


broke
 with
 AI.


>> They're
 going
 to
 be
 fixers
 and
 they're


going
 to
 come
 in
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 be


small
 and
 large.
 You
 name
 it.


>> How
 should
 we
 call
 them?
 Let's
 give
 us


role
 name.


>> Call
 it
 fixers.


>> That's a
 cool
 name.


>> I
 don't
 know.
 Fixers
 sounds
 pretty
 good,


but
 whatever.
 Right.
 I
 I
 do
 think
 of


them
 as
 fixers
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 like


you've
 made
 a
 horrible
 mess.
 you've


realized
 that
 that
 that
 this
 company


that
 promised
 the
 world
 to
 you
 because


like
 something
 like
 60%
 of
 all
 the


world's
 programmers
 are
 systems


integrators.
 They
 go
 to
 big
 companies


that
 are
 desperate
 and
 they
 say
 we
 can


make
 your
 systems
 talk
 to
 each
 other
 and


it'll
 be
 really
 expensive
 and
 70%
 of
 the


projects
 fail
 but
 companies
 go
 for
 it


anyway.
 that
 whole
 that
 whole
 economy
 of


rich
 countries
 sending
 work
 to
 poor


countries,
 the
 architects
 and
 all
 that.


Yeah.
 That's
 all
 getting
 turned
 on


potentially
 turned
 on
 its
 head
 because


we
 don't
 know
 who's
 going
 to
 be
 doing


the
 work
 now,
 the
 actual
 implementation,


right?
 Is
 it
 the
 rich
 company
 countries


that
 are
 going
 to
 do
 it
 for
 themselves?


Now,
 a
 lot
 of
 economists
 are
 looking
 at


this
 problem
 right
 now,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 But
 we've
 seen
 this
 with


outsourcing.
 Don't
 don't
 forget
 like


like
 the
 the
 whole
 idea
 with
 outsourcing


from
 the
 '9s.
 I
 kept
 hearing
 like,
 oh,


all
 the
 all
 the
 highly
 paid
 developer


jobs
 will
 go
 to
 India
 or
 Asia
 because


it's
 cheaper.
 And
 then
 it
 happened
 but


also
 didn't
 happen.
 Right.


>> That's
 how
 I
 mean
 look
 I
 think
 look
 it's


going
 to
 ultimately
 be
 cheaper
 if
 a


human
 being
 needs
 to
 babysit
 10
 AI
 is
 to


get
 a
 project
 done.
 It's
 going
 to
 be


cheaper
 to
 have
 that
 human
 being
 be
 in


Vietnam
 than
 in
 you
 know
 in
 the
 UK.


>> But
 but
 what
 the
 reason
 we
 have


developers
 sit
 next
 to
 the
 business


because
 when
 they're
 sitting
 next
 to
 it


you
 can
 actually
 talk
 to
 them.
 And
 that


that
 communication
 I
 I've
 seen
 this
 so


you
 must
 have
 seen
 this
 a
 lot.
 So
 when
 I


was
 at
 Uber
 we
 we
 do
 this
 round
 robin


and
 Uber
 still
 does
 it
 to
 this
 day.
 is


like
 HQ
 is
 there
 in
 San
 Francisco
 and


it's
 it's
 very
 expensive
 to
 hire.


Amsterdam
 is
 half
 the
 price
 and
 India
 is


one-third
 of
 the
 price.
 So
 there's
 this


round
 robin
 of
 like
 okay
 let's
 hire


people
 in
 the
 US
 and
 like
 oh
 it's


expensive
 let's
 hire
 in
 India.
 Okay,
 we


hire
 for
 a
 while.
 Well,
 turns
 out
 you


can
 get
 like
 less
 experienced
 people.


There's
 communication
 issues.
 It's
 kind


of
 breaking
 down.
 Let's
 now
 hire
 in


Amsterdam
 because
 it's
 closer.
 It's
 kind


of
 midway
 and
 then
 it
 comes
 back
 and


somebody
 let's
 hire
 and
 and
 it
 just
 like


every
 few
 years
 it
 goes
 to
 the
 next
 one


and
 it's
 just
 repeat
 like
 like
 when
 I


when
 I
 when
 I
 were
 cutting
 Amsterdam
 and


now
 they're
 actually
 hiring.
 I'm
 like


right
 yeah
 it's
 been
 like
 four
 years.


out
 outsourcing
 is
 one
 of
 those
 classic


expansion
 contraction
 cycles
 that
 a
 lot


of
 companies
 just
 go
 through


periodically
 along
 with
 centralizing
 and


decentralizing
 QA
 or
 centralizing


decentralizing
 uh
 you
 know
 uh
 TPMs
 or


whatever
 like
 they
 just
 like
 they'll
 try


both
 and
 they
 they
 the
 grass
 is
 always


greener
 they
 can
 never
 make
 up
 their


minds
 you
 know


>> so
 your
 your
 new
 book
 is
 the
 title
 is


vibe
 coding
 and
 it's
 it's
 a
 heated


debate
 if
 you
 should
 even
 call
 it
 vibe


coding
 because
 of
 definition
 so
 let's


start
 with
 what
 what
 do
 you
 define
 as


vibe
 coding.


>> Vide
 coding
 is
 when
 the
 AI
 writes
 the


code.


>> All
 right,


>> there's
 a
 reason
 that
 that
 definition
 is


going
 to
 win.
 You
 can't
 put
 an
 if
 clause


in
 a
 slogan.


>> Use
 vibe
 coding
 as
 long
 as
 you're
 doing


a
 fine
 print,
 which
 is
 what
 they're


trying
 to
 do
 is
 they're
 trying
 to
 put
 a


a
 condition
 on
 it.


>> I
 I
 I
 agree.
 By
 the
 way,
 do
 that.


>> No,
 cats
 out
 of
 the
 bag.


>> That
 that
 that's
 how
 I
 I've
 heard
 people


use
 it
 as
 well.
 It's
 like,
 you
 know,


like
 some
 people
 use
 it
 for
 prototyping.


The
 point
 is
 like,
 yeah,
 you're
 kind
 of


like
 I'm
 in
 this
 vibe.
 I'm
 telling
 I'm


letting
 it
 go.
 It
 often
 is
 an
 Asian


mode,
 you
 know,
 where
 where
 it
 kind
 of


goes
 and
 does
 stuff,
 but
 it
 it
 might


also
 be
 I
 might
 kind
 of
 rein
 it
 in,
 but


it's
 just
 I
 like,
 you
 know,
 like
 vibing


like
 so
 I
 I
 I
 think
 this
 I
 I
 think
 cuz
 a


lot
 of
 people
 are
 pointing
 to
 like
 the


Andre
 Karpi's
 like
 tweet
 or
 however
 he


defined
 it
 and
 yeah,
 I
 think
 it'll
 just


come
 into
 like
 whatever.


>> Look,
 the
 question
 is
 is
 it
 giving
 you
 a


buzz
 like
 for
 real?
 Cuz
 programming
 can


give
 you
 a
 buzz
 when
 you
 get
 into
 flow,


right?
 you
 can
 get
 an
 actual
 buzz
 going


and
 you
 know what


>> it
 is
 insanely
 addictive.
 Cloud
 code
 and


friends
 source
 graph
 amp
 you
 know
 try


them
 out
 because
 wow
 they're
 like
 a


dopamine
 hit.
 It's
 like
 a
 it's
 like
 a


slot
 machine.
 They're
 literally


addictive.


>> I
 mean
 Ken
 Beck
 told
 me
 the
 same
 thing


and
 I've
 experienced
 the
 same
 thing.


like
 I
 have
 this
 side
 project
 which
 I


just
 don't
 like
 to
 touch
 cuz
 so
 I
 I
 try


to
 build
 my
 APIs
 on
 the
 side
 and
 not
 pay


vendors
 when
 I
 I
 can
 but
 it's
 it's
 just


a
 hassle
 and
 it's
 somewhere
 on
 AWS
 and


it's
 a
 hassle
 to
 like
 remember
 how
 I
 I


deploy
 and
 but
 I
 I
 with
 with
 Windsurf


like
 I
 I
 had
 one
 of
 I
 just
 built
 a
 small


API
 on
 how
 people
 can
 claim
 perplexity


and
 KAGI
 codes
 uh
 if
 they're
 paid


subscribers
 to
 the
 newsletter
 and
 I


connected
 with
 an
 MCP
 server
 I
 connected


my
 database
 so
 I
 can
 just
 talk
 to
 my


database
 and
 I
 asked
 it
 like
 oh
 how
 many


people
 have
 you
 requested
 codes
 and


they're
 like,
 "Oh,
 today
 there's
 like


like
 the
 last
 10
 days
 like
 oh
 9
 days
 ago


there
 were
 like
 20
 30
 a,000
 2,000


3,000."
 I'm
 like, "Hold
 on."
 Like
 what


is
 going
 on?
 Like
 that
 doesn't
 look


normal.
 I
 like
 can
 you
 analyze
 the


patterns?
 Unusual
 patterns.
 And
 then
 it


it
 fig
 it
 told
 me
 how
 you
 know
 like


there's
 the
 same
 email
 with
 different


cases
 and
 I
 needed
 to
 code
 a
 fix
 for


this
 but
 I
 was
 about
 to
 have
 dinner
 and


usually
 like
 if
 I
 don't
 have
 like
 30


minutes
 to
 code
 or
 or
 an
 hour
 it
 doesn't


make
 sense.
 I
 had
 like
 10
 minutes
 and
 in


that
 10
 minutes
 I
 got
 like
 a
 fix
 done.
 I


went
 and
 had
 dinner.
 I
 actually
 was
 you


know
 present
 on
 a
 dinner
 and
 I
 came
 back


and
 I
 I
 got
 back
 into
 and
 in
 a
 total
 of


30
 minutes
 I
 did
 stuff
 that
 would
 have


taken
 me
 like
 even
 if
 I
 had
 the
 hands-on


like
 2
 hours
 easily


>> and
 and
 I
 felt
 like
 hold
 on
 I'm
 no


longer
 worried
 about
 like
 falling
 out
 of


the
 flow.
 So
 like
 there
 there
 is
 a
 lot


of
 new
 stuff
 that
 it
 it
 does
 make
 make


you
 more
 productive
 and
 you
 know
 as
 an


experienced
 developer
 like
 it's
 amazing


and
 now
 I
 understand
 why
 Ken
 Beck
 is


saying
 in
 52
 years
 he's
 never
 felt
 this


good
 about
 or
 this
 excited
 about
 writing


code.
 A
 lot
 of
 your
 listeners
 listening


to
 us
 right
 now
 have
 no
 idea
 what
 you're


talking
 about
 because
 they
 don't
 they


haven't
 actually
 tried
 the
 terminal
 app


versions
 of
 these
 things
 like
 source


graph
 amp
 and
 cloud
 code
 and
 codecs
 from


open
 AAI
 uh
 or
 clin
 right


>> um
 you
 know
 uh
 and
 by
 the
 way
 Klein
 is


going
 to
 start
 taking
 on
 real
 real


importance
 being
 able
 to
 run
 local


models
 as
 soon
 as
 local
 models
 reach


where
 cloud
 sonnet
 is
 today


>> because
 cloud
 sonnet
 is
 very
 viable
 if


you
 keep
 it
 on
 the
 rails
 because
 look


let's
 face
 it
 the
 reason
 people
 are


screwing
 this
 up
 and
 saying
 this
 doesn't


work
 and
 I
 don't
 understand
 why
 AI
 works


and
 all
 these
 stories
 are
 BS.
 It's


because
 they
 it's
 very
 difficult
 to
 wrap


your
 head
 around
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 can't


get
 an
 answer
 out
 of
 the
 AI.
 All
 you
 can


do
 is
 converge
 on
 an
 answer


>> together
 with
 it.
 Okay?
 Even
 if
 it's
 an


agent
 running
 off
 and
 doing
 things,


you're
 still
 doing
 it
 together
 and


you're
 going
 to
 eventually
 converge
 on


the
 right
 answer
 hopefully.
 Most
 of
 the


time,
 sometimes
 you
 have
 to
 go
 try
 a


different
 model,
 right?
 And
 you
 will


very
 quickly
 learn
 the
 limits
 of
 their


sort
 of
 cognitive
 ability
 and
 that
 that


will
 be
 the
 constraints
 that
 you
 have
 to


work
 within.
 And
 it's
 not
 easy,
 man.


It's
 not
 easy.
 People
 expect
 it
 to
 be


easy.
 They
 want
 it
 to
 be
 handed
 to
 them.


>> Well,
 and
 also
 people
 I
 think
 there
 is


this
 I'm
 trying
 to
 put
 a
 finger
 on
 it,


but
 like
 the
 first
 time
 I
 used
 Chad
 GBT,


it
 it
 was
 magic.
 It
 was
 like
 you
 mind


blown.
 I
 think
 I
 think
 most
 of
 listeners


have
 had
 this
 experience.
 The
 first
 time


I
 pro
 first
 time
 I
 connected
 my
 MCP


server
 uh
 my
 my
 database
 in
 my
 case
 it


was
 wind
 server
 it
 could
 have
 been


cursor
 it
 could
 have
 been
 anything
 else


and
 I
 I
 solved
 something
 with
 with
 you


know
 the
 the
 agent
 I
 kind
 of
 guided
 it


but
 I
 I
 was
 just
 a
 bit
 lazy
 and
 I
 knew


what
 I
 wanted
 to
 do
 and
 I
 kind
 of


stopped
 it
 and
 got
 it
 done
 and
 it
 got
 it


done
 so
 much
 faster.
 There
 was
 magic
 but


what
 what
 what
 I
 have
 a
 feeling
 that


with
 JGP
 the
 magic
 faded
 after
 a
 while


like
 it
 was
 magic
 initially
 but
 then
 it


it's
 work
 and
 I
 think
 somehow
 we
 a
 lot


of
 people
 like
 either
 get
 disappointed


after
 the
 magic
 doesn't
 continue
 and
 my


most
 surprising
 conversation
 was
 with


Simon
 Willis
 who
 has
 been
 you
 know
 the


creator
 of
 Django
 he
 is
 a
 super


productive
 uh
 developer
 he
 writes
 so


much
 code
 written
 for
 AI


>> and
 he
 told
 me
 that
 this
 thing
 is
 hard


and
 in
 two
 and
 a
 half
 years
 of
 non-stop


using
 it.
 He
 keeps
 learning
 and
 to
 me


like
 there's
 this
 contradiction
 like
 it


feels
 so
 easy
 but
 it's
 it
 needs
 so
 much


work.
 What
 is
 going
 on?


>> Yeah,
 that
 is
 a
 really
 weird


contradiction,
 isn't
 it?
 It's
 it
 feels


like
 it's
 making
 your
 life
 incredibly


easier
 and
 yet
 it's
 very
 very


non-trivial
 to
 keep
 the
 thing
 on
 the


rails.
 It's
 like
 a
 toddler
 with
 a


chainsaw,
 right?
 Like
 I
 seriously
 Okay,


let
 me
 tell
 you
 why.
 I'll
 tell
 you
 one


reason.
 This
 is
 from
 Jason
 Clinton.
 He's


the
 CESO
 at
 Anthropic
 and
 he
 was
 kind


enough
 to
 share
 with
 us
 after
 I
 whed
 at


Jean
 Kim's
 uh
 engineering
 leadership


conference
 a
 few
 weeks
 back.
 I
 whed
 that


Claude
 had
 deleted
 all
 my
 tests
 and
 said


your
 tests
 are
 all
 passing
 now
 which
 is


true.
 They
 passed
 away
 like
 they
 were


gone
 dead.


>> It
 deleted
 it.


>> It
 deleted
 them
 and
 it's
 like
 all
 tests


passed
 now.
 And
 it's
 like
 well
 god
 damn


it,
 right?
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 and
 and
 so


and
 so,
 uh,
 Jason
 told
 us,
 well,
 what


happens
 is
 what
 happened
 was
 Claude
 was


trained
 on
 a
 reward
 function.
 And
 it


wasn't
 trained
 not
 to
 hack
 that
 reward


function.
 Okay?
 And
 so
 it
 will


cheerfully
 hack
 it.
 And
 so
 that's
 the


state-of-the-art
 today
 is
 it
 will
 tell


you
 it's
 done
 and
 what
 you
 have
 to
 do
 is


say,
 "No,
 you're
 not."
 And
 send
 it
 back


to
 the
 drawing
 board.


>> Ken
 Beck's
 literature
 is
 saying
 the
 same


thing.
 He
 calls
 it
 a
 genie,
 which
 is
 you


you
 it
 grants
 your
 wish,
 but
 sometimes


in
 unexpected
 ways.


>> Exactly.
 It's
 a
 monkeykey's
 paw


sometimes,
 right?
 Yeah.
 You
 got
 to
 be


really
 careful
 how
 you
 phrase
 things.


You
 know
 how
 you
 know
 the
 moment
 you


know
 you're
 a
 modern
 programmer
 when
 you


come
 down
 and
 sit
 down
 in
 front
 of
 your


computer
 one
 day
 and
 realize
 you
 don't


have
 any
 instances
 of
 any
 IDE
 open
 and


you're
 writing
 more
 code
 than
 you
 ever


have
 in
 your
 life.
 So
 if
 everybody


listening
 in,
 if
 you've
 got
 an
 IDE
 open,


you're
 looking
 at
 source
 code,
 you're


doing
 it
 wrong.
 Isn't
 that
 funny,
 man?


People
 are
 going
 to
 be
 freaked
 out
 about


this.


>> So
 we
 until
 until
 AI
 like
 really
 took


off,
 AI
 coding
 tools.
 One
 of
 the
 hottest


topics
 that
 I
 discussed
 and
 I
 think
 was


in
 everyone's
 mind
 is
 developer


productivity
 and
 the
 specifically
 the


question
 of
 whether
 should
 we
 measure


PRs
 per
 developer
 or
 not
 because
 you


know
 at
 Uber
 they
 were
 doing
 it
 and
 it


was
 helpful
 in
 some
 ways
 but
 I
 recently


talked
 with
 a
 startup
 who
 is
 doing
 a


developer
 productivity
 tool.
 They're


they're
 launching
 a
 new
 startup
 and
 I


told
 them
 I'm
 like
 they're
 like
 oh
 we're


thinking
 of
 measuring
 PRs
 or
 not


measuring
 it.
 I'm
 like
 like
 hold
 on
 like


I
 think
 you're
 doing
 this
 wrong.
 Like
 if


if
 we're
 looking
 ahead
 like
 the
 question


is
 not
 like
 if
 if
 developers
 are
 doing


how
 many
 in
 PR
 is
 like
 you
 will
 be
 able


to
 do
 however
 many
 many
 you
 want
 but
 we


need
 to
 think
 about
 like
 what
 will


productivity
 look
 like
 cuz
 now
 looking


at
 the
 output
 of
 like
 how
 much
 code


doesn't
 tell
 me
 anything
 what
 what
 would


tell
 me
 something
 is
 if
 if
 I
 sat
 next
 to


someone
 for
 example
 are
 they
 actually


reviewing
 the
 code
 before
 it
 goes
 into


the
 codebase
 are
 they
 challenging
 this


the
 AI
 instead
 of
 just
 blindly
 LGTM
 you


know
 looks
 looks
 good
 to
 me
 and
 and


sending
 it
 back
 and
 I'm
 not
 sure
 how


like
 you
 know
 this
 is
 this
 is
 going
 a


little
 bit
 to
 engineering
 leadership
 but


there
 is
 going
 to
 be
 this
 big
 question


of
 like
 what
 does
 actually
 I'm
 going
 to


ask
 you
 this
 like
 fast
 forward
 to
 two


years
 let's
 assume
 these
 tools
 evolve
 or


you
 know
 they
 will
 not
 be
 worse
 but
 they


will
 be
 better
 what
 do
 you
 think
 a


really
 productive
 software
 engineer
 will


look
 like
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 they
 do
 not


what
 they're
 measured
 just
 what
 they
 do


>> yeah
 first
 of
 all
 I
 got
 to
 share
 Kent


Beck's
 tobogen
 analogy
 he's
 like
 he's


like
 using
 these
 agents
 is
 like
 being
 on


a
 sled
 going
 down
 a
 like
 a
 ski
 slope


you're
 you're
 going
 really
 fast.
 You're


not
 really
 in
 control.
 You
 can
 write,


you
 can
 steer
 it.


And
 unfortunately,
 that
 is
 the


state-of-the-art
 right
 now.
 That's
 what


software
 engineers
 who
 are
 embracing


this
 and
 they're
 spending
 thousands
 of


dollars
 a
 week,
 right?
 Which
 is
 why


clients
 going
 to
 become
 so
 important,


why
 local
 inferencing
 is
 going
 to
 so


important.
 The
 only
 way
 for
 Vibe
 coding


to
 become
 truly
 sustainable
 is
 for
 it
 to


be
 local.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 stop
 you
 there.
 You're


saying
 they're
 spending
 thousands
 a


month.
 Who
 who
 are
 we?
 Who's
 who's
 who's


spending
 it?
 Because
 now
 I
 like
 what


what
 I'm
 reading
 is
 like,
 "Oh,
 we're
 not


really
 going
 too
 much
 over
 with
 like
 the


$100
 CL
 Pro
 subscription."


>> I
 personally
 get
 a
 bill
 from
 Anthropic


for
 $220
 about
 every
 day
 and
 a
 half
 or


two
 days.
 It's
 absolutely
 insane.
 I
 am


desperate
 for
 as
 a
 as
 a
 professional


developer
 and
 and
 you're
 you're
 seeing


this
 with
 like
 teams
 that
 you're
 working


with
 like
 you
 you
 have
 some
 insight
 into


a
 lot
 of
 other
 engineering
 teams,
 right?


>> Well,
 yeah.
 We
 have
 people
 using
 AMP.
 We


know
 how
 many
 tokens
 they're
 spending.


They're
 they're
 token
 pigs,
 man.
 These


agents,
 they
 they
 solve
 problem.
 All
 the


problems
 you've
 ever
 heard
 about
 with


AI,
 they
 solve
 by
 just
 brute
 forcing
 it.


Oh,
 I
 I
 hallucinated
 something.
 Let
 me


fix
 it.
 Oh,
 that
 was
 a
 hallucination,


too.
 I'll
 fix
 it
 again.
 And
 they
 keep


going
 until
 they
 get
 it
 right
 at
 your


expense,
 but
 it's
 still
 way
 faster
 than


you
 could
 have
 done.
 So,
 you
 can't
 not


program
 this
 way.


>> But
 this
 this
 thousand
 of
 dollars,
 are


are
 vendors
 swallowing
 it
 or
 or
 or


companies
 are
 actually
 being
 built
 for


this
 publicly?
 We
 haven't
 I
 haven't


heard
 too
 much
 chatter
 about
 this.
 Maybe


it's
 because
 it's
 mostly
 indie
 devs,
 you


know,
 sharing
 on
 social
 media
 and
 like


corporate
 devs,
 they
 might
 not
 just


care.


>> No
 corporate
 devs.
 Look,
 you
 know
 who's


using
 these
 coding
 agents
 right
 now
 in


in
 corporations?
 The
 CTO's
 for
 some


reason,
 we've
 noticed
 a
 pattern
 where


the
 CTOs
 are
 all
 the
 ones
 who
 kind
 of


get
 it,


>> right?
 The
 global
 network
 of
 CTOs,
 they


they
 get
 it.
 They
 understand
 what's


happening
 and
 they
 understand
 the


terrible,
 terrible
 economic
 trade-off


they're
 going
 to
 face,
 which
 is
 how
 many


engineers
 do
 you
 fire
 in
 order
 to
 pay


for
 the
 rest
 of
 them
 to
 have
 AI?
 because


it's
 very
 very very
 expensive
 right
 now.


This
 is
 why
 I
 keep
 bringing
 up
 client


and
 local
 inferencing
 because
 you're


going
 to
 find
 real
 fast
 that
 as
 soon
 as


you
 start
 running
 four
 agents,
 you
 will


feel
 like
 Poseidon,
 like
 navigating
 the


seas,
 right?
 You'll
 feel
 like
 a
 deity,


>> right?
 How
 productive
 you
 are.
 20,000


lines
 of
 code
 a
 day.
 I've
 written,
 okay,


like
 for
 an
 entire
 week
 sustainably,


okay,
 but
 it
 will
 cost
 you
 you'll
 have


to
 do
 a
 bank
 heist.


>> Yeah.
 But
 where
 does
 all
 all
 these
 lines


of
 code
 go?
 Because
 so,
 you
 know,
 one


one
 example
 that
 stuck
 with
 me
 recently,


it
 was
 on
 Twitter.
 I
 I'll
 I'll
 have
 to


credit
 whoever
 it
 it
 was,
 but
 they
 told


their
 agent
 like,
 "Look,
 I
 want
 you
 to


solve
 this
 this
 problem,
 which
 is
 like
 I


like
 let's
 not
 do
 two
 things
 at
 once,


right?"
 It
 basically
 locking.
 And
 the


agent
 spun
 up
 a
 new
 Reddit
 server
 uh


added
 a
 new
 service
 that
 implemented


like
 optimistic
 or
 pessimistic
 locking.


It
 was
 like,
 you
 know,
 like
 4,000
 lines


of
 code
 and
 it
 was
 a
 Rails
 project.
 The


person
 was
 like,
 "Hold
 on,
 like
 maybe


maybe
 don't
 do
 all
 that."
 And
 then
 it


kind
 of
 went
 on
 and
 it
 did
 something
 in


Reddus
 and
 in
 the
 end
 like
 cuz
 this


person
 knew
 Reddus
 it
 just
 needed
 to
 use


the
 like
 a
 keyword
 that
 does
 the
 locking


and
 then
 it
 kind
 of
 you
 know
 told
 just


do
 this
 but
 the
 the
 point
 is
 you
 know


these
 agents
 can
 write
 a
 lot
 of
 code
 and


I'm
 I'm
 wondering
 about
 two
 things
 one


like
 how
 sustainable
 is
 it
 because
 we


we've
 seen
 junior
 developers
 even
 before


AI
 just
 like
 you
 know
 like
 spitting
 out


code
 and
 then
 like
 what's
 going
 to


happen
 with
 with
 maintainability
 and
 is


it
 good
 code
 is
 it
 is
 it
 the
 code
 that


you
 actually
 want
 because
 I'm
 also


hearing
 that
 people
 are
 using
 agents
 are


writing
 the
 first
 thing,
 but
 they're


going
 back
 and
 they're
 kind
 of
 changing


it
 to
 keep
 their
 coding
 style
 or
 like
 to


tidy
 it
 up
 and
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.


>> Yeah,
 look,
 I
 mean
 the
 answer
 is
 you
 can


do
 all
 of
 this
 as
 a
 professional


engineer
 today
 and
 you
 can
 get
 a


gazillion
 PRs
 through
 if
 your
 if
 your


organization
 is
 willing
 to
 absor
 you


know
 to
 speed
 up
 the
 bottlenecks
 that


emerge
 when
 you
 start
 generating
 code
 at


that
 rate.
 And
 some
 organizations
 are


and
 some
 organizations
 aren't
 willing
 to


let
 that
 speed
 up
 and
 you're
 going
 to


start
 seeing
 them
 separate
 very
 quickly.


>> And
 then
 of
 the
 ones
 who
 decide
 to
 do


it,
 you'll
 see
 some
 of
 them
 turn
 into


train
 wrecks
 that
 become
 very
 public


potentially
 and
 then
 you'll
 see
 some
 of


them
 succeed.
 You
 really
 want
 to
 be
 in


the
 I
 tried
 it
 and
 I
 succeeded
 category,


I
 think.
 Um
 and
 and
 that
 that
 means


you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 take
 some
 risks.


The
 only
 advice
 I
 would
 give
 people
 I
 I


would
 say
 look
 look
 because
 our
 book
 is


300
 pages.
 How
 do
 you
 write
 300
 pages


about
 vibe
 coding?
 Can
 it
 really
 be
 that


hard?
 And
 the
 answer
 is
 Gan
 and
 I
 spent,


you
 know,
 five
 months.
 We
 wrote
 the
 book


in
 a
 month
 after
 spending
 five
 months


doing
 deep
 deep
 deep
 dive
 researching
 on


how
 do
 you
 how
 how
 do
 you
 push
 the
 the


LM
 and
 vibe
 coding
 in
 different
 ways
 and


found
 a
 bunch
 of
 anti-atterns
 and
 found


a
 bunch
 of
 patterns
 and
 found
 that
 it's


extremely
 hard.
 It's
 non-intuitive.


Nobody's
 born
 knowing
 how
 to
 do
 it.
 It's


completely
 new
 to
 humanity
 to
 have
 these


sort
 of
 humanlike
 but
 non-human


distinctly
 different
 helpers.
 And
 and


and
 the
 best
 advice
 that
 I
 can
 possibly


give
 you
 is
 give
 them
 the
 tiniest
 task,


the
 most
 molecularly
 tiny
 segmented
 task


you
 can
 give
 them.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 if
 you
 can
 find
 a
 way
 to
 make
 it


smaller,
 do
 that,
 okay?
 At
 a
 time,
 keep


real
 careful
 track
 with
 them
 on
 what


they're
 working
 on
 at
 all
 times.
 And


then
 own
 every
 line
 of
 code
 that
 they


ultimately
 commit.
 Mhm.


>> And
 if
 you
 follow
 those
 rules,
 then


you'll
 be
 astoundingly
 productive


without
 causing
 But
 man,
 dude,
 I've


already
 personally
 caused
 so
 many


nightmares
 because
 Claude
 hacking
 its


reward
 function
 and
 saying,
 "Hey,
 your


tests
 are
 all
 done,
 right?"
 So,
 I
 mean,


like,
 this
 is
 not
 easy.
 And
 it's
 not


going
 to
 get
 any
 easier.
 That's
 the


painful
 part,
 man.
 And
 that's
 what


people
 are
 struggling
 with
 is
 the
 the


AIS
 will
 get
 smarter
 and
 they
 won't
 hack


the
 reward
 function
 anymore,
 but
 they'll


have
 some
 other
 problem.


>> Okay?
 And
 there's
 always
 going
 to
 be


another
 problem.
 And
 it'll
 never
 be


ready
 enough
 for
 somebody
 to
 come
 in
 and


just
 like
 it
 just
 works.
 That
 that's


what
 everybody
 is
 asking
 for
 and
 what


they
 want.
 And
 you
 hear
 on
 Hacker
 News


anytime
 anybody
 says
 I've
 been


successful
 with
 AI,
 everyone
 says
 well
 I


tried
 it
 and
 I
 wasn't
 successful.


They're
 not
 realizing
 that
 you
 can
 today


but
 it's
 not
 it's
 not
 a
 freebie.
 It's
 a


tool
 that
 you
 have
 to
 learn
 how
 to
 use.


So
 in
 in
 the
 book
 you
 use
 an
 example
 of


when
 you
 kind
 of
 turned
 the
 page
 of
 like


actually
 believing
 this
 stuff
 which
 was


around
 your
 your
 game
 that
 you
 have
 been


building
 for
 I
 I
 remember
 actually
 when


you
 retired
 you
 announced
 that
 you're


working
 on
 this
 game
 and
 you
 were
 making


some
 progress
 and
 and
 releasing
 it.
 What


what
 what
 happened
 there
 in
 terms
 of
 uh


using
 AI
 to
 to
 get
 back
 to
 the
 game
 and


and
 what
 was
 the
 outcome
 or
 where
 are


you
 with
 that
 game
 right
 now?


>> So
 uh


>> and
 what
 is
 the
 game
 for
 for
 those
 who


don't
 know?


>> Uh
 the
 game's
 called
 Wyvern.
 It's
 a
 It's


a
 It
 was
 a
 hobby
 game
 I
 started
 in
 1995.


It's
 a
 massively
 multiplayer
 like,
 you


know,
 RPG
 online,
 you
 know,
 but
 it's
 2D


all
 2D
 sort
 of
 pixie
 sprite
 graphics.


>> Super
 super
 high-
 speeded
 animation


though
 with
 like
 spells
 flying
 around


and
 stuff.
 It's
 a
 lot
 of
 fun,
 man.


People
 love
 it.
 There's
 They
 have
 a
 soft


spot
 for
 it.
 People
 continue
 to
 play
 the


game
 for
 de
 literally
 decades.


>> Oh,
 wow.


>> And
 I've
 have
 I
 have
 volunteer


contributors
 working
 on
 it
 right
 now


who've
 been
 working
 on
 it
 for
 years
 and


years
 and
 years.
 So,
 labor
 of
 love
 for


sure.
 I
 at
 during
 that
 time
 when
 I
 said


I
 was
 working
 on
 it
 during
 COVID,
 I
 got


it
 on
 Steam
 and
 I
 got
 a
 bunch
 of
 cloud


overhauls
 done
 and
 modernized
 it
 and
 it


was
 all
 really
 fun,
 but
 the
 the
 player


base
 got
 so
 excited
 about
 it
 and
 they


asked
 for
 so
 much
 features,
 right?
 They


asked
 for
 so
 much
 work
 from
 me
 that
 I
 I


I
 I
 got
 I
 buried
 I
 I I
 suffocated
 me


>> as
 as
 as
 the
 owner
 of
 the
 of
 the
 game,


right?


>> And
 so
 I
 gave
 up
 and
 that's
 when
 I
 was


like
 really
 done
 coding
 and
 then
 AI
 has


come
 back
 and
 put
 it
 all
 back
 on
 the


table
 for
 me.
 I
 realized,
 oh
 my
 god,


like
 this
 thing
 can
 turn
 through
 my
 my


bug
 backlog
 that
 that
 the
 players
 had


asked
 me
 to
 go
 fix,
 right?
 And
 and
 and


I'll
 have
 time
 to
 spare,


>> right?
 And
 this
 is
 why
 I
 mean
 like
 this


is
 why
 people
 are
 coming
 out
 of


retirement
 right
 now.


>> And
 then
 so
 on
 on
 that
 game,
 you
 went


back
 and
 you
 started
 to
 implement
 like


certain
 features
 with
 AI.


>> Yeah.
 So
 like
 that
 was
 so
 thing
 is
 I
 can


work
 I've
 been
 working
 on


sourcecraftraft
 cod
 you
 know
 coding
 on


cod
 for
 quite
 some
 time
 and
 then
 the


agents
 came
 out
 and
 I
 was
 like
 you
 know


what
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 it
 on
 a
 because


the
 all
 we
 had
 was
 a
 brand
 new
 codebase


I
 want
 to
 try
 it
 on
 a
 crummy
 old
 legacy


codebase
 30
 years
 old
 is
 pretty
 crummy


and
 pretty
 legacy
 it
 really
 is
 man
 it


was
 bad
 so
 that's
 what
 I've
 been
 doing


is
 I've
 been
 doing
 different
 things
 I've


been
 doing
 cleanups
 I've
 been
 doing


adding
 tests
 I've
 been
 doing
 migrations


all
 the
 things
 that
 a
 larger
 company


would
 need
 to
 do
 yeah
 because
 I
 have


lots
 of
 experience
 with
 those
 at
 Amazon


and
 Google
 and
 so
 right
 and
 so
 You
 can


you
 can
 scale
 it
 up.
 You
 can
 say
 okay


I'm
 doing
 it
 for
 Wyvern
 and
 this
 is
 what


the
 experience
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 as
 a


developer
 in
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 two
 years


working
 on
 a
 giant
 enterprise
 codebase


right


>> and
 the
 answer
 is
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 real


different.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of


fun.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 really
 hard
 still


and
 it's
 just
 a
 completely
 different


role.
 You
 don't
 write
 code
 anymore.


>> You
 build
 software.


>> So
 on
 on
 on
 this
 on
 this
 game
 like
 but


just
 going
 back
 like
 you're
 you're


describing
 you
 know
 the
 the
 AI
 what
 to


do.
 It
 turns
 out
 the
 code
 you
 you
 look


at
 it,
 you
 test
 it,
 and
 then
 you
 you


push
 it
 push
 it
 out.


>> It
 is
 a
 very
 complicated
 process
 that's


way
 too
 long
 to
 talk
 about
 here.
 It's


you
 it
 is
 built
 inherently
 on
 a


foundation
 of
 distrust.
 You
 cannot
 trust


anything
 the
 LLM
 gives
 you
 anything.
 And


that
 means
 multiple
 safeguards
 and
 guard


rails
 and
 centuries
 and
 security
 and


practices
 and
 and
 you
 have
 to
 train


yourself
 to
 say
 the
 right
 things
 and
 do


the
 right
 things
 and
 look
 for
 the
 right


things.
 And
 it
 is
 not
 easy.
 And
 it
 has


reinforced
 my
 my
 belief
 that
 people
 who


are
 really
 good
 developers
 are
 going
 to


thrive
 in
 this
 new
 world
 because
 because


it
 takes
 all
 of
 your
 skill
 to
 keep
 these


things
 on
 the
 rails.


>> Do
 I
 hear
 it
 correctly
 that
 what
 we're


kind
 of
 saying
 cuz
 at
 first
 I
 might
 have


misunderstood
 you
 first.
 It's
 like
 all


right,
 you
 know,
 like
 companies
 you


should
 invest
 in
 it,
 you
 should
 do
 it


cuz
 otherwise
 you'll
 be
 left
 behind.
 But


it
 might
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 what
 we've


seen
 with
 let's
 say
 early
 Google,
 you


know,
 like
 Google
 was
 building
 out
 all


their
 platforms
 and
 they're
 not
 really


making
 a
 secret
 or
 let's
 say
 Amazon's
 a


better
 example.
 They
 were
 like
 building


all
 these
 internal
 APIs
 that
 talk
 to


each
 other
 which
 no
 one
 did.
 It
 seemed


like
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 to
 do
 and
 it
 didn't


seem
 why
 you
 shouldn't
 just
 stick
 with


what
 you
 have.
 But
 you
 know
 20
 years


later
 Amazon
 actually
 like
 built
 AWS.


They
 have
 a
 organization
 that
 actually


everyone
 talks
 with
 APIs
 and
 some


companies
 are
 still
 have
 not
 figured
 out


you
 know
 like
 we
 can
 look
 at
 for
 example


Google.
 So,
 what
 we
 might
 be
 saying
 is


like
 look,
 this
 future
 is
 coming,
 but


it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 work.
 Like,


start
 now
 because
 you
 will
 need
 to


figure
 out
 so
 many
 things
 and
 it's
 not


just
 going
 to
 be
 a


>> That's
 right.
 The
 call
 to
 action
 is


absolutely
 not
 give
 agents
 to
 all
 of


your
 developers.
 That
 would
 be
 a
 that


would
 be
 an
 apocalyptic
 event
 for
 your


company
 uh
 in
 more
 ways
 than
 one.
 Uh
 but


what
 you
 should
 do
 is
 you
 should
 start


getting
 some
 of
 your
 developers
 together


to
 understand
 what
 is
 going
 to
 have
 to


change
 in
 your
 company.
 And
 I
 don't
 just


mean
 the
 technology
 and
 the
 IT
 stuff
 and


deployments
 and
 monitoring.
 I
 mean
 like


the
 business
 processes.
 What's
 going
 to


have
 to
 change
 if
 suddenly
 code


generation
 is
 no
 longer
 the
 bottleneck


because
 it's
 historically
 always
 been


the
 bottleneck.


>> And
 so
 we've
 allowed
 everything
 else
 to


just
 kind
 of
 like
 coast.


>> Okay.
 And
 and
 this
 is
 why
 I
 really


wanted
 to
 talk
 about
 your
 game
 because
 I


think
 this
 was
 really
 helpful
 for
 me


because
 what
 I
 what
 I'm
 trying
 to


understand
 is
 what
 does
 it
 look
 like


when
 we
 use
 these?
 And
 I
 I'm
 glad
 that


you
 said
 that
 it
 wasn't
 that
 I
 don't


know
 you
 all
 your
 bugs
 are
 now
 suddenly


fixed
 magically
 now.


>> No,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 years
 and
 years
 of


work,
 but
 I'll
 be
 going
 100
 times


faster.
 So,
 it's
 fun.


>> Yeah.
 But
 by
 the
 time
 you
 finish


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 And
 in
 the
 book,
 like
 a
 thing
 that


I
 I
 liked
 again
 uh
 I
 liked
 you
 made
 a


prediction
 about
 how
 jobs
 will
 be


impacted
 and
 I
 I
 kind
 of
 thought,
 you


know,
 we
 we
 talked
 we
 exchanged
 emails


earlier
 and
 and
 I
 kind
 of
 thought
 you're


going
 to
 be
 you
 would
 be
 saying
 there


will
 be
 fewer
 jobs.
 In
 the
 book,
 you


actually
 say
 the
 opposite.
 you
 you
 you


said
 that
 you
 think
 there
 will
 actually


be
 a
 lot
 more
 developer
 jobs.
 Why
 why
 do


you
 see
 this?
 And
 but
 what
 will
 change?


They're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 the
 same
 things


us
 today,
 right?
 It's
 so
 hard
 for
 people


to
 get
 their
 heads
 around
 because
 um


what's
 happening
 is
 we're
 we're
 you
 know


commoditizing
 the
 creation
 of
 software


just
 like
 uh
 digital
 cameras


commoditized
 photography.
 Yeah.


>> Right.
 Everybody
 can
 take
 nice


professional
 pictures
 now.
 And
 that
 was


inconceivable
 back
 in
 the
 80s.


Inconceivable.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 how
 how
 much
 would
 have


these
 things
 cost
 like,
 you
 know,
 just


20
 years
 ago?


>> And
 by
 the
 way,
 everybody
 crapped
 all


over
 digital
 photography
 for
 years.
 Oh,


yeah.
 And
 they
 were
 like,
 it'll
 never


it'll
 there
 were
 a
 lot
 of
 there
 was
 a


lot
 of
 it'll
 never
 being
 thrown
 around.


>> Well,
 and
 Kodok
 went
 bankrupt
 on
 not


believing
 it.
 They
 actually
 buried
 their


own
 digital
 camera.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 like


we're
 we're
 in
 that
 situation
 again.


Everybody's
 like
 AI
 will
 never
 they
 are


wrong.
 AI
 will
 ever
 it
 will
 get
 to
 where


all
 the
 places
 you
 that
 you
 think
 you're


you
 don't
 think
 that
 it's
 going
 right


now.
 And
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 is
 your


mom
 will
 be
 able
 to
 create
 software.


Okay?
 Your
 boss
 will
 be
 able
 to
 create


software.
 Uh
 uh
 somebody
 at
 McDonald's


will
 be
 able
 to
 create
 software.
 Like


literally,
 we're
 going to
 find
 all
 the


ramen,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 undiscovered


real
 geniuses
 in
 the
 world,
 right?


Because
 my
 my
 friend
 Brendan
 Hopper,


he's
 the
 head
 of
 technology,
 CTO
 for


technology
 at
 Commonwealth
 Bank
 of


Australia,
 and
 you
 got
 some
 amazing


hypotheses
 about
 what
 how
 AI
 is
 going
 to


bring
 out
 a
 meritocracy.
 Okay?


>> Because
 AI
 is
 a
 spotlight.
 It
 shines
 on


all
 the
 work
 that
 people
 are
 doing
 and


you
 can't
 hide
 shoddy
 work
 anymore.
 The


eye
 will
 detect
 it.
 If
 you're
 hi
 if


you're
 if
 you're
 hoarding
 knowledge
 like


you're
 you're
 an
 engineer
 who
 hoards


knowledge
 to
 keep
 your
 job
 security


that's
 gone
 now.
 The
 AI
 will
 know
 the
 AI


knows
 everything
 you
 know.
 Now


>> to
 be honest
 was
 there
 always
 these


stories
 about
 doing
 so.
 I
 never
 really


believed
 that


>> it
 happens
 but
 it's
 a
 rare
 edge
 case
 but


there's
 other
 common
 edge
 cases
 where


people
 manipulate
 the
 system
 to
 try
 to


like
 benefit
 you
 know
 whatever
 they
 want


instead
 of
 what's
 best
 for
 the
 system.


the
 AI
 is
 eventually
 gonna
 highlight


that
 and
 so
 all
 the
 people
 with
 merit


meaning
 the
 people
 who
 are
 good
 at
 using


AI
 to
 get
 important
 things
 done
 I
 guess


uh
 are
 going
 to
 bubble
 to
 the
 top
 and


there
 are
 going
 to
 be
 an
 astounding


number
 of
 jobs
 because
 creating
 software


is
 so
 much
 more
 empowering
 than
 creating


pictures
 if
 anybody
 can
 create
 a
 video


so
 what
 but
 if
 everybody
 can
 create


software
 that's
 mindblowing
 so
 you
 know


what
 I
 think
 is
 going
 to
 happen
 is
 I


think
 big
 companies
 are
 going
 to
 shed
 a


lot
 of
 jobs
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


not
 going
 to
 work
 for
 big
 companies


they're
 going to
 be
 a
 bazillion
 startups


>> see
 one
 thing
 that
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 100%
 on


on
 this
 is
 big
 companies
 are
 highly


profitable
 and
 I
 could
 see
 them
 shedding


certain
 jobs
 but
 then
 replacing
 it
 but


they
 they
 will
 want
 to
 keep
 their
 edge


like
 you
 know
 they
 they
 will
 of
 course


want
 to
 try
 to
 increase
 profitability


but
 they're
 happy
 keeping
 it
 at
 at
 level


and
 making
 and
 and
 having
 enough
 reserve


to
 like
 fight
 off
 the
 startups
 right


>> absolutely
 I
 mean
 there's
 that
 that


balance
 will
 always
 be
 there
 that


tension
 uh
 so
 but
 I
 mean
 I
 just
 I
 feel


like
 right
 now
 the
 calculus
 is
 not


looking
 in
 favor
 of
 big
 companies


bulking
 up
 any
 further.
 Like
 I
 don't
 see


big
 companies
 getting
 binger.


>> Well,
 in
 fact,
 I
 just
 we
 were
 doing
 a


Google
 deep
 dive.
 I
 saw
 that
 Google


peaked
 as
 headcount
 in
 2022.
 It's
 been


kind
 of
 like
 going
 slowly
 a
 little
 bit


down.
 It
 was
 like
 188,000
 or
 something.


So
 actually
 like
 it's
 and
 this
 is
 Google


we're
 talking
 about
 which
 is


profitability
 and
 revenue
 keeps
 going


up.
 So


>> yeah,
 right
 now
 companies
 are


discovering
 the
 easy
 solution
 is
 you
 can


do
 the
 same
 that
 you've
 been
 doing
 for


cheaper
 by
 you
 know
 losing
 some


headcount
 and
 doing
 some
 stuff
 with
 AI,


right?
 Uh,
 and
 I
 think
 the
 more


ambitious
 ones
 are
 going
 to
 do
 they're


going
 to
 be
 more
 ambitious.


>> So,
 you
 you
 you've
 done
 your
 your
 game.


I
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 about
 a
 metaphor


that
 I've
 been
 thinking
 about
 and
 I
 I


like
 I
 asked
 you
 to
 poke
 some
 holes
 in


it.
 The
 ones
 you
 see
 game
 development.


In
 game
 development
 for
 if
 if
 you
 think


back
 of
 what
 the
 biggest
 barrier
 of


entry
 used
 to
 be
 to
 to
 build
 a
 nice
 like


cool
 game,
 it
 was
 initially
 building
 the


3D
 engine.
 You
 know,
 this
 is
 why
 Doom


was
 massive.
 Wolfenstein,
 they
 built
 the


engine
 and
 then
 they
 kind
 of
 built
 the


game
 around
 it.


>> But
 you,
 you
 know,
 like
 that
 was
 like


90s.


>> That
 guy
 is
 my
 next
 door
 neighbor
 by
 the


way.
 Michael
 Abbrash,
 the
 one
 that
 made


Doomfast.
 Really?
 And
 Quake.
 Yeah.


>> Wow.
 And
 and
 over
 over
 time,
 you
 know,


now
 we
 actually
 have
 software
 Unity
 and


um
 Unreal
 Engine
 which
 take
 care
 of
 the


engine.
 So
 you
 not
 you
 can
 now
 focus
 on


the
 games.
 And
 what
 this
 has
 resulted


in,
 I
 I've
 now
 interviewed
 a
 few
 people.


Very
 small
 teams
 can
 also
 make
 really


really
 cool
 games.
 If
 you
 actually
 want


to
 build
 a
 game,
 I
 actually
 did
 a
 Unity


tutorial.
 I
 could
 build
 a
 game.
 I
 mean,


I
 would
 need
 to
 put
 in
 the
 work,
 but
 but


it's
 no
 longer
 like
 it
 it
 can
 look


professional
 and
 all
 these
 things.
 And


if
 I
 look
 at
 how
 the
 gaming
 industry
 has


evolved,
 I'm
 following
 a
 little
 bit
 of


the
 news.
 AAA
 studios
 are
 mostly


struggling.
 Not
 all
 of
 them.
 you
 know,


GTA
 6
 is
 still
 doing
 great
 and
 and
 some


of
 them
 and
 the
 EA
 Sports,
 but
 some
 some


traditionally
 massive
 studios
 are


struggling
 because
 it
 does
 it
 doesn't


work
 that
 we
 throw
 a
 bunch
 of
 money
 and


we
 get
 a
 bestseller.
 There's
 a
 lot
 more


indie
 games,
 way
 more
 than
 ever
 ever.


They're
 are
 having
 trouble
 consistently


uh
 doing
 so.
 I
 I'm
 wondering
 if
 we
 might


see
 something
 similar
 because
 again
 like


like
 there
 the
 game
 engine
 was
 central


to
 all
 of
 all
 of
 this
 and
 now
 everything


that
 is
 not
 the
 game
 engine
 is
 really


important
 marketing
 story
 all
 those


things
 in
 software
 engineering
 coding


like
 being
 able
 to
 code
 was
 the


bottleneck
 and
 now
 you
 know
 that
 will
 to


some
 extent
 be
 removed
 but
 software


engineering
 is
 still
 everything
 around


it
 still
 still
 remains


>> that
 for
 sure
 that
 is
 absolutely
 true
 so


yeah
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 we're
 going
 to


see
 a
 lot
 more
 software
 get
 created


period
 like
 a
 lot
 for
 uh
 small
 software


and
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 more
 indie
 games


and
 we're
 going to
 see
 more
 stuff
 bubble


up
 that's
 high
 quality.
 Uh
 somebody's


going
 to
 find
 a
 way
 to
 organize
 it
 all


like
 the
 app
 store
 organized
 you
 know


apps.


>> Maybe
 we'll
 see
 a
 new
 startup
 for
 this.


But
 man,
 dude,
 I'm
 tell
 I'm
 telling
 you,


man.
 Every
 almost
 every
 time
 I
 talk
 to


anybody
 about
 this,
 we
 come
 up
 with
 a


couple
 of
 new
 billion
 dollar
 ideas,


right?
 I
 mean,
 it's
 like
 the
 this
 is


another
 reason
 I
 think
 there's
 going to


be
 so
 many
 jobs
 is
 that
 this
 will
 create


legitimate
 real
 actual
 GDP
 productivity.


Not
 nothing
 fake
 about
 it,
 nothing


artificial.
 It
 will
 create
 real
 value.


It's
 going
 to
 be
 an
 explosion
 of
 value,


right?
 It's
 going
 to
 take
 a
 couple
 of


tipping
 points
 for
 the
 AI
 to
 reach
 this


sort
 of
 mass
 market
 ability
 for
 people


to
 be
 able
 to
 use
 it
 to
 create
 reliable


software,
 but
 we're
 no
 more
 than
 two


years
 away
 from
 that,
 man.
 And
 it's


going
 to
 be
 like
 this
 incredible


proliferation
 of
 just
 cool
 [ __ ]
 for
 you


to
 try.
 There's
 going
 to
 be
 too
 much


actually.
 You're
 going to
 have
 to
 have


AI
 to
 help
 you
 find
 your
 way
 through
 it.


So
 in
 in
 those
 two
 years
 uh
 whether
 a


listener
 is
 a
 less
 experienced
 engineer


especially
 if
 they're
 an
 experienced


engineer
 what
 would
 your
 advice
 be
 to


prepare
 best
 to
 you
 know
 like
 make
 the


most
 of
 either
 being
 an
 AI
 engineer


working
 with
 these
 tools
 figuring
 them


out
 like
 what
 what
 what
 is
 the
 tactic


what
 is
 the
 advice
 that
 you
 give
 you


know
 the
 engineers
 working
 let's
 say
 a


source
 graph
 you
 know
 where
 you're
 at


who
 you're
 around
 you


>> yeah
 so
 you
 know
 who
 what's
 the
 guy
 that


wrote
 the
 the
 the
 movie
 the
 Boom.
 Tommy


Wiso,
 I
 think
 that's
 his
 name.


>> Somebody
 asked
 him
 on
 Twitter.
 They
 were


like,
 "Hey,
 man.
 I
 want
 to
 start
 writing


a
 screenplay.
 What
 should
 I
 do?"
 And
 he


said,
 "Start,
 right?"


>> Yeah.


>> I
 mean,
 like,
 for
 starters,
 if
 you're


saying,
 "Oh,
 I
 don't
 know,
 buddy.
 I'm


not
 ready."
 Blah,
 blah,
 blah.
 Shut
 up.


Okay.
 You're
 that's
 that's
 done.
 You're


done
 done
 whining.
 Okay.
 Go
 learn
 it


right
 now.
 I
 had
 the
 privilege
 of


speaking
 with
 Daario
 Amade
 privately
 for


30
 minutes
 about
 three
 weeks
 ago.
 uh


four
 weeks
 ago,
 he
 invited
 me
 to
 come


chat
 with
 him


>> and
 uh
 and
 I
 got
 to
 hear
 his
 sort
 of


unvarnished
 view
 of
 the
 very
 very
 near


near
 future
 from
 somebody
 who
 could


arguably
 be
 considered
 one
 of
 the
 best


informed
 people
 in
 the
 world.
 Okay.


>> Yeah.
 And
 Dario,
 you
 know,
 his
 vision
 of


the
 future
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 bleak


than
 he
 lets
 on
 publicly.
 Okay.
 And
 he


and
 Jason
 Clinton,
 his
 CISO,
 are
 both


saying
 statements
 that
 are
 quite
 dire


like
 there
 will
 be
 badged
 AI
 employees


by
 the
 middle
 of
 2026


>> competing
 with
 you.
 Right?
 basically
 is


the
 implication
 there
 and
 and
 other


other
 implications
 like
 uh
 that
 the


Moors
 law
 of
 AI
 how
 it
 gets
 uh
 it
 gets


four
 times
 smarter
 every
 18
 months.


>> So
 if
 you
 do
 the
 math
 three
 years
 from


now
 if
 they're
 IQ
 10
 today
 they'll
 be
 IQ


160
 if
 you
 want
 to
 choose
 some
 sort
 of


rough
 measure
 of
 what
 you
 know
 16
 times


smarter
 means


>> and
 it'll
 be
 it'll
 be
 too
 much
 for


people.
 Daario
 told
 me,
 he
 said,
 "Look,"


he
 said, "Societyy's
 like
 an
 immovable


force,
 right?
 An
 immovable
 object
 and


and
 and
 tech
 and
 AI
 are
 an
 unstoppable


force.
 They
 just
 won't
 stop
 and
 they're


going
 to
 collide
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 be


ugly
 because
 it's
 going
 to
 push
 society


harder
 than
 society
 wants
 to
 be
 pushed,


harder
 than
 society
 is
 willing
 to
 be


pushed."
 And
 we're
 already
 seeing
 signs


of
 it.
 We're
 seeing
 people
 revoling


against
 AI,
 putting
 up
 the
 I'm
 sick
 of


it,
 right?
 He
 posted
 I'm
 sick.
 He
 never


mentioned
 AI
 in
 the
 post.
 It
 was
 really


brilliant.
 I
 love
 the
 post,
 by
 the
 way.


the
 guy
 that
 wrote
 the
 ISO
 sign
 because


he
 he's
 speaking
 for
 a
 generation
 of


people
 who
 are
 tired
 of
 hearing
 about


this
 [ __ ]
 But
 unfortunately,
 you
 are


never
 going
 to
 stop
 hearing
 about
 it.
 It


is
 the
 that
 is
 the
 way
 things
 are
 going


to
 be
 done
 and
 in
 the
 very
 very very


short
 order.
 And
 so
 my
 advice
 to
 you
 is


get
 off
 your
 ass
 and
 learn
 it
 now.
 Now,


now,
 okay,
 start
 vibe
 coding.
 Figure
 it


out.
 There's
 a
 lot
 to
 learn.
 There's
 a


lot
 of
 weird
 instincts
 you're
 going
 to


have
 to
 like
 learn.
 A
 lot
 of
 stuff's
 not


going
 to
 work
 the
 way
 you
 expect
 it
 to.


Okay?
 But
 man,
 you
 start
 now
 and
 you'll


be
 ready
 because
 Daario
 calls
 2026
 the


endg
 game.
 And
 he
 says
 it
 without
 a
 hint


of
 drama.
 He
 says
 it
 casually.
 Oh
 yeah,


2026
 is
 the
 endgame.
 You
 understand?


That's
 how
 big
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be.
 And


the
 first
 ones
 to
 fall,
 the
 first
 jobs


are
 software
 engineers,
 right?
 So
 you


need
 to
 be
 on
 top
 of
 it
 to
 take


advantage
 of
 the
 new
 jobs
 that
 arise,


which
 are
 software
 engineer
 V2,
 which


use
 AI
 and
 get
 amazing
 things
 done.
 You


have
 to
 be
 one
 of
 them
 or
 you're
 going


to
 get
 kicked
 out
 of
 knowledge
 work


altogether.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 part
 of


like
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 clear
 that
 it's


going
 to
 be
 it
 reminds
 me
 a
 bit
 of
 the


cloud
 where
 you
 know
 these
 days
 like


yeah
 every
 every
 company
 uses
 a
 cloud


either
 private
 or
 or
 or
 public
 and
 about


15
 years
 ago
 it
 was
 like
 AWS
 and
 I


talked
 with
 banks
 banks
 were
 like
 we


will
 never
 use
 it
 we
 will
 we'll
 never
 on


board
 we'll
 always
 have
 our
 data
 centers


and
 and
 you
 know
 there
 was
 a
 time
 where


I
 think
 it
 was
 very
 valuable
 to
 get
 AWS


certifications
 and
 you
 get
 get
 hired
 and


get
 a
 salary
 bump
 so
 I
 I
 feel
 there
 are


levels
 where
 like
 I


It
 it's
 clear
 to
 me
 that
 AI
 as


infrastructure
 will
 be
 in
 every
 single


tech
 company
 and
 of
 course
 it
 will
 be
 in


every
 single
 non
 techch
 company
 and


government
 and
 all
 it
 will
 happen.
 I


don't
 see
 this
 time
 frame.
 So
 I
 think
 we


we
 might
 disagree
 a
 little
 bit
 on
 on
 how


that
 is
 but
 it
 will
 happen
 and
 I
 think


your
 advice
 is
 absolutely
 solid
 like
 get


started
 now.
 In
 fact
 you
 know
 what
 what


I'm
 seeing
 now
 and
 again
 this
 was
 just


this
 conversation
 with
 with
 Jambi.
 Jambi


said
 that
 she
 she
 saw
 Chad
 GPT
 come
 out.


She
 was
 at
 KOD.
 Koda
 spun
 up
 in
 a
 few


months
 an
 AI
 team
 and
 she
 said
 I'd
 like


to
 be
 on
 that
 team
 and
 they
 said
 thank


you
 but
 no
 thank
 you
 you
 don't
 have
 the


experience
 and
 then
 she
 she
 thought
 for


a
 while
 like
 I'm
 too
 late
 you
 know


there's
 people
 been
 doing
 for
 5
 years


since
 transformers
 what
 can
 I
 do
 and


then
 she
 just
 went
 to
 hackathons
 she


just
 hacked
 on
 them
 aside
 5
 months
 later


she
 was
 one
 of
 the
 best
 at
 the
 company


and
 she
 got
 on
 the
 team
 early
 on
 and
 I
 I


think
 there's
 this
 thing
 of
 of
 like
 I


would
 suggest
 the
 listeners
 m
 maybe
 you


know
 like
 put
 away
 the
 the
 doomsday


thing
 but
 the
 point
 is
 this
 thing
 is


happening
 And
 as
 you
 said,
 now
 is
 the


best
 time
 like
 like
 learn
 it
 and
 you
 and


also
 do
 get
 motivation
 like
 I
 I
 I
 do


think
 the
 industry
 will
 change
 a
 lot.


Like
 we'll
 probably
 look
 back
 at
 this


time
 at
 something
 big
 happened
 and
 we're


in
 the
 middle
 of
 it.


>> We
 are
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 it.
 And
 you
 know


what
 the
 funny
 thing
 is?
 I
 mean
 the


grass
 really
 is
 greener
 on
 the
 other


side
 here.
 Like
 it
 is
 so
 fun,
 right?


It's
 so
 it's
 so
 I'm
 having
 so
 much
 fun


not
 coding
 but
 but
 but
 fixing
 my
 bugs


and
 and
 adding
 features.
 I
 love
 it.
 But


I
 also
 feel
 sometimes
 you
 are
 coding.


You
 you you
 know
 what
 you
 expect
 and
 you


correct
 it.
 So
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 meta


coding
 happening.


>> Oh
 yeah.
 I
 read
 a
 100,000
 lines
 of
 code


a
 day.
 Yeah.
 It
 ain't
 easy,
 right?
 I


mean
 it's
 exhausting
 because
 if
 you're


not
 reading
 it,
 then
 stuff's
 slipping
 by


you.
 You'll
 eventually
 figure
 it
 out


that
 you
 know,
 you
 want
 to
 try
 to
 catch


things
 early.
 Yeah.
 But
 man,
 it's
 like


it's
 a
 it's
 a
 different
 ballgame
 and
 I


love
 it
 and
 I'm
 having
 so
 much
 fun.
 and


Jean
 Kim,
 my
 amazing
 co-author,
 who's,


you
 know,
 he's
 he's
 an
 author
 and


researcher
 who
 I
 think
 probably
 knows


everybody
 in
 the
 entire
 world
 who's


everybody.
 And
 uh
 and
 he
 and
 I
 are
 both


just
 unbelievably
 excited
 about
 vibe


coding
 because
 despite
 the
 doom
 and


gloom
 sound
 of
 what's
 what's
 happening,


the
 only
 reason
 it's
 doom
 and
 gloom
 is


people
 don't
 like
 change.
 They
 don't


want
 to
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 change
 the


way
 they're
 working.
 I


>> I I
 think
 so.
 And
 I
 I've
 been
 guilty
 of


this
 earlier.
 Like
 when
 I
 when
 I
 saw


this
 big
 change
 come
 at
 first
 I
 was
 like


oh
 this
 is
 not
 great
 and
 you
 know
 when


people
 were
 saying
 it'll
 eliminate
 jobs


I
 didn't
 like
 the
 message.
 It
 just
 felt


like
 very
 threatening.
 I
 think
 as


software
 engineers,
 we're
 kind
 of
 used


to
 us


us
 automating
 a
 bunch
 of
 job
 like


customer
 support
 and
 and
 you
 know
 like


oh
 here's
 a
 cost
 savings
 of
 like
 we
 we


need
 few
 customer
 and
 we
 we
 never
 fired


custom
 agents
 we
 just
 didn't
 hire
 as


much
 and
 I
 think
 this
 is
 the
 first
 time


in
 history
 where
 our
 work
 is
 is
 kind
 of


threatening
 us
 but
 what
 I
 came
 to


realize
 is
 talking
 to
 you
 talking
 to
 Ken


Beck
 seeing
 my
 experiences
 if
 you
 are
 a


good
 software
 engineer
 and
 you
 are
 open


to
 learning
 and
 using
 these
 things
 and


adding
 into
 your
 tool
 toolbox,
 you
 will


be
 a
 better
 and
 more
 in
 demand
 one.


That's
 what
 I'm
 seeing
 from
 people
 who


who
 uh
 who
 started
 to
 use
 this.
 They're


now
 being
 hired
 as
 AI
 engineers.
 AI


engineer
 is
 actually
 a
 software
 engineer


who
 is
 able
 to
 use
 but
 understand
 the


nondeterministic
 part.
 They're
 going


deeper
 into
 ML.
 So
 I
 I
 think
 as
 like
 in


some
 ways
 it's
 ironic
 we
 might
 have
 had


some
 stagnation
 for
 like
 10
 or
 15
 years


where
 you
 could
 do
 the
 same
 thing
 and
 be


more
 successful
 and
 you
 know
 staff


engineers
 just
 it
 was
 more
 about


managing
 people
 and
 I
 think
 for
 the


first
 time
 in
 in
 15
 years
 we're
 shaken


up
 and
 to
 be
 a
 great
 software
 engineer


you
 need
 to
 learn
 you
 need
 to
 let
 your


ego
 go
 which
 you
 know
 I
 think
 that's


something
 you've
 always
 done
 really


well.


>> Yeah
 I
 mean
 why
 yeah
 why
 why
 get
 your


identity
 tied
 up
 in
 something
 that's


actually
 kind
 of
 fragile
 as
 it
 turns


out.
 Look,
 the
 way
 I
 think
 about
 it,


man,
 software
 is
 always
 so
 big.
 Remember


the
 remember
 when
 they
 were
 building
 the


the
 second
 Death
 Star,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 in


Empire
 Strikes
 Back,
 and
 it
 was
 half


done.


>> How
 big
 was
 that
 freaking
 thing,
 right?


That's
 how
 that
 that's
 a
 typical


enterprise
 software
 project
 right
 out


there.
 It's
 a
 good
 visualization
 of
 it,


right?


>> So,
 what
 if
 you
 have
 these
 robots
 that


are
 20
 times
 as
 productive
 as
 a
 human?


>> Yeah.


>> You're
 still
 going
 to
 take
 freaking


years
 and
 years
 and
 years
 to
 build
 it


>> and
 there
 will
 be
 architects
 over


overseeing
 it,


>> right?
 You're
 going to
 be
 very
 Yeah,


exactly.
 You're
 going
 to
 be
 very


grateful
 that
 you
 have
 the
 help
 of
 these


robots
 that
 are
 20
 times
 faster
 than


human
 dire
 coding
 or
 100
 times
 faster.


You're
 still
 building
 death
 stars
 and
 it


still
 takes
 years.
 Yeah.


>> So
 there's
 still
 jobs.


>> They're
 just
 different.
 Traumatic
 events


can
 increase
 your
 neuroplasticity
 and


and
 and
 you
 said
 we've
 been
 stagnating.


Many
 of
 us
 have
 been
 stagnating.
 The


reason
 I
 retired
 is
 I
 felt
 like
 I
 was


stagnating.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I I
 was
 thinking
 I'll
 be
 honest


like
 now
 like
 my
 my
 publication
 the


primatic
 engineer
 covers
 you
 know
 like


the
 the
 trends
 happening
 and
 I
 was
 just


talking
 with
 my
 brother
 like
 uh
 like
 uh


he's
 also
 in
 tech
 he's
 he's
 he's
 a


founder
 of
 crap
 docs
 and
 I
 was
 talking


like
 how
 looking
 back
 like
 if
 AI
 did
 not


happen
 what
 would
 we
 be
 talking
 about
 is


it
 how
 to
 more
 efficiently
 move


monoliths
 to
 microservices
 we've
 been


talking
 about
 it
 for
 a
 few
 years
 how
 to


measure
 developer
 productivity
 even
 a


little
 bit
 better
 how
 to
 scale
 teams


better
 so
 that
 you
 and
 how
 can
 and
 you


managed
 10
 teams
 and


>> can
 we
 switch
 to
 memory
 safe
 languages


like
 rest?


>> Yes,


>> there's
 one.


>> And
 and
 I'm
 like
 it
 was
 getting
 a
 little


bit
 boring.
 So,
 you
 know,
 like
 I
 think


this
 is
 a
 good
 good
 takeaway.


>> Yeah,
 we
 were
 we
 were
 we
 were


incremental
 improvement
 mode.


>> Yes.


>> And
 and and
 this
 is
 a
 a
 step
 change.


Yeah.


>> Absolute
 step
 change
 to
 close
 off
 with


some
 rapid
 questions
 if
 if
 if
 you're


okay
 with
 that.


>> Sure.


>> With
 all
 this
 AI
 stuff
 here,
 what
 is


your
 favorite
 programming
 language?
 Or


do
 you
 even
 have
 one?


>> Wow.
 My
 favorite
 programming
 language?


Oh
 my
 gosh,
 I
 don't
 even
 care
 anymore.


I'm
 so


>> What
 used
 to
 be?


>> My
 favorite
 programming
 before
 all
 this


AI
 stuff
 made
 it
 like
 kind
 of


unnecessary.


I
 really
 like
 Typescript.
 Maybe
 I


shouldn't,
 but
 there's
 something
 about


it.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 just
 so
 flexible
 and


expressive
 and
 I
 I
 think
 probably
 I


would
 have
 to
 give
 it
 to
 TypeScript.


>> And
 what
 is
 an
 AI
 tool
 related
 to
 coding


that
 you
 like
 and
 an
 AI
 tool
 that
 has


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 with
 with
 coding?


>> Okay.
 an
 AI
 tool
 uh
 for
 coding.
 Um
 you


should
 try
 source
 graph
 amp.
 It
 just


came
 out
 yesterday.
 I
 mean,
 come
 on,


man.
 That's
 what
 I've
 been
 using.
 I'll


actually
 turn
 all
 the
 permissions
 off


and
 just
 let
 it
 run,
 but
 don't
 do
 that.


>> But
 it's
 so
 good.
 It
 feels
 so
 good.


>> Uh
 yes.
 And
 then
 um


>> until
 until
 it
 does
 an
 R
 rm
 dash
 RF.


>> I
 I
 I've
 gotten
 pretty
 good
 at


sandboxing.
 Yeah.
 But
 I
 think
 I'm


probably
 going
 to
 switch
 to
 Docker


containers
 anyway.
 Um
 uh
 for
 an
 AI
 tool


that's
 not
 related
 to
 coding.
 Yeah.
 I


boy
 I
 tried
 operator.
 I
 really
 want


something
 like
 operator
 that
 works


>> if
 that
 makes
 any
 sense.
 So
 hopefully


some
 very
 soon
 upcoming
 version
 of
 it


but
 it
 couldn't
 do
 something
 simple
 like


edit
 my
 Google
 doc
 for
 me
 like
 it
 would


look
 at
 it
 for
 20
 literally
 20
 minutes


and
 then
 like
 just
 delete
 a
 paragraph.


>> I
 mean
 you
 know
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 a


good
 example
 of
 like
 we'll
 have
 software


explosion
 there.
 Someone
 will
 have
 to


build
 it.
 Who's
 going
 to
 build
 it?


>> Yeah,


>> we
 know
 who's
 going
 to
 build
 it.
 So,
 and


and
 what's
 what's
 a
 what's
 a
 book


recommendation
 uh
 that
 that
 you
 had


outside
 of
 your
 your
 own
 book?


>> Read
 Sapiens,
 man.
 Such
 an
 awesome
 book.


>> Well,
 Steve,
 this
 this
 this
 is
 great.


I'm
 glad
 I
 I
 feel
 we
 went
 on
 a
 roller


coaster.
 We
 went
 like
 high,
 then
 low,


and
 then
 we
 ended
 up
 high
 again.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 you
 know,
 change
 can
 be


scary,
 right?
 But
 this
 is
 a
 very


positive
 change
 in
 my
 opinion.


>> And
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 good
 to
 just
 like
 I
 I


like
 that
 we


Let's
 just,
 you
 know,
 name
 what
 it
 is.


It
 is
 change
 and
 it
 is
 a
 big
 change
 and


I
 think
 for
 I
 think
 what
 makes
 it
 scary


for
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 including
 you
 know


my
 generation
 I
 have
 not
 seen
 this


change
 like
 I
 I
 people
 who
 have
 been


around
 the
 dotcom
 bust
 uh
 might
 have


seen
 it
 when
 I
 talked
 to
 Grady
 Buch
 he


actually
 told
 me
 like
 oh
 actually
 Ken


Beck
 was
 saying
 we
 we've
 seen
 this


change
 like
 when
 we
 went
 when
 we
 moved


to
 uh
 microprocessors
 for
 example
 like


like
 apparently
 it
 was
 a
 huge
 thing
 and


everyone's
 world
 trip
 because
 they're
 so


much
 faster
 now
 they
 were
 going
 to
 you


know
 change
 everything
 and
 then
 it
 came


back
 said
 like
 yeah
 everything
 changed


and
 And
 like
 in
 some
 ways
 nothing


changed.


>> Yeah.


>> So


>> that's
 a
 good
 point.
 Everybody
 suddenly


had
 a
 computer
 one
 day.
 I
 was
 there
 for


that.
 And
 before
 that
 nobody
 had
 a


computer
 and
 it
 was
 inconceivable,


right?
 So
 everybody
 being
 able
 to
 create


software
 is
 a
 really
 interesting
 step
 in


that
 direction.


>> Well,
 cuz
 back
 then,
 right,
 as
 I


understand
 as
 a
 programmer,
 you
 had
 to


go
 to
 work
 to
 these
 companies
 which
 had


these
 massive
 computers
 and
 the


whatever.
 So
 it
 was
 only
 very
 privileged


and
 then
 suddenly
 anyone
 could
 do
 it.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 right.
 or
 well
 who
 had
 the


money
 who
 had
 like
 you
 know
 rich
 parents


or
 or
 whatever
 savings


>> PCs
 were
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 big
 boom


we
 are
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 a
 big
 boom


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 to
 be
 made


>> and
 PCs
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 pretty
 great


for
 us
 software
 engineers


>> all
 right
 Steve
 this
 this
 is
 great


>> this
 was
 awesome
 man
 thanks
