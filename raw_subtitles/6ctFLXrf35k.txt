>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 OddLots
 podcast.
 I'm
 Joe
 Weisenthal.


>> And
 I'm
 Tracy
 Aloway.


>> Tracy
 metals.
 Metals.


>> That's
 it.
 That's
 the
 episode.


>> That's
 it.
 It's
 the
 title.


>> No,
 you're
 right.
 There
 is
 a
 lot


happening
 in
 the
 metals
 space.
 So,
 we


have
 gold
 above
 5,500
 an
 ounce,
 which
 is


a
 record.
 We
 have
 silver
 above
 $120
 an


ounce,
 also
 a
 record.
 And
 now
 we
 have


copper
 at
 over
 $14,400


a
 ton.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 this
 is
 something
 that's
 super


interesting
 to
 me
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 a


very
 important
 dimension,
 which
 is
 that


copper
 is
 the
 ultimate
 industrial
 metal,


right?
 And
 for
 you
 know,
 Dr.
 Copper


tells
 us
 about
 the
 economy.
 Probably
 a


little
 overstated,
 its
 reputation,
 but


it's
 the
 ultimate
 industrial
 metal.


>> Gold
 is
 the
 ultimate
 metal
 with
 no


industrial
 uses,
 right?
 It's
 primarily
 a


store
 of
 value,
 a
 sort
 of
 uh
 form
 of


money
 that's
 existed
 for
 thousands
 of


years.


>> And
 then
 silver
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 in
 the


middle.
 It's
 more
 of
 a
 safe
 haven,
 but


we
 know
 it
 has
 it's
 used
 in
 solar,
 it's


used
 in
 photography.
 Not
 that
 that


really
 exists
 anymore,
 but
 you
 know
 what


I
 was
 saying.
 So,
 it's
 like
 it's


interesting
 to
 see
 like
 why
 are
 they
 all


flying
 at
 the
 exact
 same
 time?
 Yeah,
 I


was
 going
 to
 say
 the
 exact
 same
 thing.


So
 each
 of
 these
 metals
 historically


would
 tell
 you
 something
 very
 specific


about
 the
 state
 of
 the
 economy
 and


copper
 certainly
 would
 be
 screaming


people
 are
 bullish
 on
 economic
 growth.


Silver,
 you
 know,
 something
 kind
 of
 in


the
 middle
 and
 gold,
 gold
 soaring
 is


something
 that
 you
 traditionally


associate
 with
 stress
 points
 either
 in


the
 financial
 system
 or
 the
 broader


global
 economy
 and
 yet
 here
 we
 are.


Yeah,
 it's
 all
 happening
 in
 once
 and


like
 you
 know,
 you
 know,
 you
 could
 say


like,
 oh,
 dollar
 debasement,
 right?
 And


we
 know
 the
 dollar
 has
 been
 weak
 against


other
 currencies.
 It's
 not
 like


inflation
 as
 measured,
 you
 know,
 is
 like


raging
 hot.
 So,
 it's
 not
 just
 a
 simple


of
 story
 of
 like
 the
 dollar
 becoming


worthless.
 So,
 the,
 you
 know,
 the


denominator
 whatever
 going
 up
 or


whatever
 the
 other
 way
 around
 is,
 etc.


There's
 something
 going
 on
 with
 metals.


Maybe
 they're
 just
 the
 new
 meme
 stocks,


etc.
 But,
 uh,
 we
 have
 to
 we
 have
 to
 dig


in.


>> Yeah,
 let's
 do
 it.


>> All right.
 Well,
 I
 have
 to
 say
 we
 really


do
 have
 the
 perfect
 guest
 on
 the
 perfect


day.
 Again,
 we're
 recording
 this
 the


morning
 of
 January
 29th.
 We're
 going
 to


try
 and
 get
 it
 out
 ASAP.
 But
 this


headline,
 copper
 surging
 10%.


Unbelievable
 headlines.
 We've
 had
 him
 on


multiple
 times
 in
 the
 past,
 a
 believer


in
 super
 cycles,
 a
 vindicated
 man
 in


many
 respects
 with
 many
 of
 his
 calls.
 He


was
 a
 Goldman
 a
 long
 time.
 We're
 going


to
 be
 speaking
 with
 the
 one
 and
 only


Jeff
 Curry
 who
 is
 now
 a
 partner
 at


Carile
 knows
 commodities
 as
 well
 as


anyone
 else
 we
 talked
 to.
 So
 Jeff,
 thank


you
 so
 much
 for
 coming
 back
 on
 the


Outlaws
 podcast.


>> Great.
 Well,
 thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.


You
 know,
 commodities
 are
 up
 and
 back
 in


favor.
 It
 was
 a
 rough
 last
 couple
 of


years
 to
 say
 the
 least.


>> What
 do
 uh
 what
 do
 we


>> We
 should
 just
 ask
 is
 this
 going
 to
 be


the
 peak?


>> Yeah.
 Is
 this
 the
 peak?
 Did
 we
 Is
 uh


Yeah,
 that's
 the
 question.
 Is
 this
 the


peak?
 Because


>> they're
 back
 on.
 Everyone's
 going
 to
 ask


is
 this
 the
 peak?
 Oh,
 did
 online
 get
 the


peak?
 Cuz
 they
 called
 they
 ring
 Jeff


Curry.
 So,
 let's
 just
 get
 this
 out
 of


the
 way.


>> By
 the
 way,
 I
 love
 that
 we're
 in
 the


foothills
 of
 the
 Himalayas
 right
 now.


So,
 we're
 not
 even
 close
 to
 the
 the
 real


mountain
 peaks
 yet.


>> Really?


>> Yes.


>> Okay.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 the
 obvious


question,
 which
 we
 alluded
 to
 in
 the


intro,
 but
 why
 are
 all
 three
 of
 these


things
 moving
 in
 the
 same
 direction
 all


at
 once?
 When
 you
 look
 at
 the
 commodity


complex,
 you
 take
 anything
 that
 has
 an


atomic
 number
 to
 it
 that's
 in
 the


periodic
 table,
 it's
 going
 up
 right
 now.


>> Even
 nickel
 and
 zinc
 have
 joined
 the


party.


>> If
 it
 is
 a
 molecule
 and
 it
 has
 a
 carbon


in
 it,
 a
 carbon
 hydrogen,
 a
 CH
 in
 it,


it's
 been
 struggling.
 So
 that
 includes


hydrocarbons
 as
 well
 as
 carbohydrates


like
 corn,
 wheat,
 and
 so
 forth.
 So
 that


space
 the
 molecules
 have
 been
 struggling


yet
 you
 have
 the
 things
 that
 are


primarily
 critical
 minerals
 things
 that


are
 in
 the
 periodic
 table
 the
 atomic


number
 have
 all
 done
 well
 and
 the


fundamentals
 in
 copper
 are
 not
 that
 much


tighter
 than
 what
 you
 have
 in
 oil.
 that


what's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 metal
 space
 is


hoarding
 given
 the
 concerns
 over
 having


availability
 of
 these
 critical
 minerals


and
 you
 you
 threw
 out
 the
 idea
 of


debasement
 and
 I
 want
 to
 throw
 in
 three


other
 D's
 dd
 dollararization
 and


diversity
 to
 your
 debasement
 so


debasement
 ddollarization
 and
 diversity


is
 what's
 driving
 all
 of
 these
 different


metals
 and
 when
 we
 think
 about
 the


ddollarization
 and
 that
 goes
 back
 to


2022
 when
 the
 US
 and
 Europeans
 froze
 the


central
 bank
 assets
 of
 Russia.
 Every


emerging
 market
 goes,
 uhoh,
 I
 don't
 want


to
 be
 owning
 any
 dollar
 denominated


assets
 because
 look
 what
 happened
 to
 the


Russians.


>> And
 as
 a
 result,
 they're
 moving
 as
 fast


as
 they
 can
 out
 of
 dollar
 assets
 and


into
 assets
 that
 cannot
 be
 seized.
 And


precious
 metals
 and
 metals
 are
 part
 of


that.
 And
 then
 when
 you
 have
 the


geopolitical
 risk
 as
 high
 as
 they
 are


right
 now
 on
 a
 global
 basis,
 whether
 it


was
 US
 cutting
 off
 Venezuelan
 oil
 supply


to
 China,
 India
 and
 Europe,
 or
 it
 was


the
 Chinese
 cutting
 off
 critical
 mineral


supply
 to
 the
 US
 and
 its
 allies,
 or
 it's


Russia
 cutting
 off
 supplies
 of
 natural


gas,
 it's
 a
 dangerous
 time
 to
 be


dependent
 upon
 foreign
 commodity
 supply.


And
 as
 a
 result,
 we
 have
 stockpiling.


And
 we
 everybody
 talks
 about
 the
 squeeze


in
 silver
 running
 it
 up
 to
 $120
 an


ounce.
 The
 reality
 is
 this
 is
 a
 squeeze


by
 the
 population
 of
 the
 people
 in


China.
 You
 know,
 they're
 hoarding
 the


silver
 over
 concerns
 around,
 you
 know,


export
 controls
 and
 things
 of
 that


nature.
 So
 you
 mentioned
 China
 just
 then


and
 this
 is
 exactly
 what
 we
 wanted
 to


ask
 you
 about
 which
 is
 if
 you
 stripped


out
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 China.
 How
 much


of
 the
 rally
 would
 disappear
 in


something
 like
 gold?


>> I
 I
 mean
 the
 vast
 majority
 of
 it
 is
 not


just
 China
 but
 emerging
 market
 central


bank
 buying
 basically
 reduce
 their


holdings
 of
 western
 bonds
 that
 can
 be


frozen
 similar
 to
 what
 happened
 with
 the


Russians.
 So,
 you
 know,
 do
 not


underestimate
 the
 impact
 that
 China's


had.
 In
 fact,
 if
 anything,
 China
 and
 the


other
 emerging
 markets
 have
 squeezed


other
 participants
 in
 the
 gold
 market


out


>> and
 you
 still
 have
 a
 long
 ways
 to
 go.
 I


like
 to
 point
 out
 that
 in
 1970


when
 Nixon
 took
 the
 US
 off
 the
 gold


standard,
 central
 bank
 reserves
 of
 gold


stood
 at
 around
 40%.
 Last
 time
 I


calculated
 late
 day
 in
 the
 last
 year
 was


in
 that
 27
 to
 28%.
 But
 the
 run
 up
 in
 the


last
 couple
 of
 days
 could
 be
 as
 high
 as


30
 by
 now.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 key
 message


is
 there's
 still
 a
 lot
 more
 buying
 by


central
 banks
 who
 diversify
 themselves


out
 of
 dollars.


>> I
 I'm
 still
 a
 little
 bit
 confused.
 What


is
 it
 about
 silver
 particularly
 that's


so
 desirable
 right
 now
 from
 the


population
 in
 China?
 Because
 just
 let's


talk
 about
 hoarding
 and
 some
 of
 these


issues.
 It's
 totally
 understandable
 why


China
 wants
 to
 hold
 certain
 strategic


assets,
 right?
 It
 wants
 to
 accumulate
 a


lot
 of
 oil
 in
 part
 because
 of
 defense


purposes
 because
 in
 the
 event
 of
 a
 war


for
 whatever
 reason,
 they
 may
 get
 shot


out
 of
 oil.
 So,
 they
 need
 a
 lot.
 What
 is


it
 about
 silver
 in
 the
 population


context
 that
 makes
 it
 so
 desirable?
 And


by
 the
 way,
 I'm
 looking
 at
 a
 chart.
 This


is
 from
 two
 days
 ago,
 but
 the
 Shanghai


silver
 premium
 buyers
 in
 China
 paying


more
 than
 $5
 an
 ounce
 versus
 everyone


else
 in
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world.
 But


explain
 what
 is
 it
 that's
 driving
 this


purchase
 from
 the
 public
 in
 China.


>> Okay,
 first
 let's
 talk
 about
 its
 role
 as


a
 critical
 mineral.
 It
 goes
 into
 the


production
 solar
 PV
 and
 that
 makes
 it
 as


you
 pointed
 out
 at
 the
 beginning
 50%
 an


industrial
 metal
 and
 then
 50%
 of
 a
 store


value
 like
 gold.
 So
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 has


these
 dual
 uses,
 it's
 a
 critical
 mineral


and
 important
 to
 the
 electrification


process
 on
 a
 global
 basis.
 Remember,


it's
 a
 superconductor.
 Actually,
 let
 me


go
 back
 to
 answer
 your
 question,
 Tracy.


We
 said,
 what
 do
 gold,
 silver,
 and


copper
 all
 have
 in
 common?
 They're


superconductors.


>> I
 know
 people
 say,
 "Well,
 Jeeoff,
 copper


isn't
 exactly
 a
 definition
 of
 a


superconductor.
 It's
 not
 as
 strong
 as


silver
 and
 gold,
 but
 it
 sits
 up
 there
 in


that
 electrification
 process."
 And
 so


when
 we
 think
 about
 silver,
 it's


critical
 for
 the
 industrial
 base
 of


China,
 given
 the
 importance
 of
 solar


panels
 as
 a
 part
 of
 the
 industrial


manufacturing
 process
 in
 China.
 So
 you


know
 whether
 if
 you're
 the
 PBOC
 or


something
 like
 that,
 you
 we're
 going
 to


be
 very
 focused
 on
 making
 sure
 there's


adequate
 silver
 supplies
 inside
 of


China.
 Um,
 so
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 also
 then


has
 the
 store
 of
 value
 like
 gold
 and


accessible
 by
 many
 parts
 of
 the


population
 because
 even
 at
 you
 know


hundred
 $100
 an
 ounce,
 $120
 an
 ounce
 as


where
 we're
 this
 morning,
 it
 still
 makes


it
 a
 much
 more
 affordable


u
 you
 store
 of
 value.
 So
 I
 think
 the
 two


key
 points
 for
 China
 and
 why
 silver
 is


so
 important
 is
 its
 role
 as
 a
 critical


mineral
 and
 as
 a
 superconductor.
 And


given
 the
 importance
 of
 solar
 panels
 and


other
 types
 of
 renewable
 investments
 to


the
 Chinese
 industrial
 base,
 having
 a


secure
 supply
 of
 silver
 is
 absolutely


critical
 to
 the
 Chinese
 economy.
 Second


of
 all
 is
 when
 we
 look
 at
 the
 price
 of


silver,
 even
 at
 $120
 an
 ounce,
 it
 is


still
 very
 affordable
 to
 many
 of
 the


population
 as
 a
 store
 of
 value
 similar


to
 gold.
 And
 also
 given
 the
 recent
 price


trends,
 people
 feel
 comfortable
 in


holding
 it.
 So
 it
 has
 those
 two


components
 that
 make
 it
 critical
 to
 the


Chinese
 economy.


>> Some
 people
 would
 say
 that
 like
 all


right,
 you
 can
 look
 at
 all
 these
 things


surging
 and
 tell
 a
 story
 about


debasement
 and
 electrification
 and
 what


the
 future
 world
 is
 going
 to
 look
 like.


Some
 other
 people
 would
 say,
 well,
 you


could
 tell
 an
 even
 simpler
 story,
 which


is
 that
 one
 of
 these
 markets
 is
 wrong,


right?
 So
 [clears throat]
 maybe
 copper


sees
 economic
 growth
 going
 to
 the
 moon,


although
 it
 seems
 kind
 of
 unlikely
 to


me.
 Maybe
 silver
 is
 somewhere
 in


between.
 Maybe
 gold
 is
 wrong
 about
 the


debasement
 thesis,
 whatever.
 How
 do
 we


know
 that
 we're
 just
 not
 seeing


investors
 get
 this
 one
 wrong?
 People
 are


just
 going
 for
 the
 meme
 coinification
 of


precious
 met
 of
 metals.
 Well,
 I
 I
 do


think
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 a
 commodity


super
 cycle,


>> the
 sword,


>> which
 by
 the
 way
 is
 nothing
 other
 than
 a


commodity
 capex
 cycle
 or
 a
 big
 global


capback
 cycle.
 And
 we're
 seeing
 that,


you
 know,
 whe
 it's
 an
 investment
 in


defense,
 investment
 into
 AI,
 data


centers,
 the
 list
 goes
 on.
 This
 is
 a


worldcale
 capex
 boom
 we're
 now
 entering.


And
 that
 typically
 is
 when
 you
 see
 the


big
 commodity
 super
 cycles,
 one
 in
 the


70s,
 one
 in
 the
 2000s.
 And
 we're
 I
 mean


just
 take
 the
 defense
 spending
 in
 Europe


alone.
 It's
 likely
 to
 be
 9
 trillion


euros
 over
 the
 next
 decade.
 To
 put
 that


in
 perspective,
 the
 Chinese
 boom
 in
 the


2000s
 was
 10
 trillion
 US.
 Today
 it's


about
 15.
 So
 even
 just
 Europe
 on
 alone,


we
 haven't
 even
 factored
 in
 data
 centers


and
 AI.
 So
 when
 that
 occurs
 typically


what
 we
 see
 is
 a
 rericing
 a
 rerating


towards
 asset
 heavy
 industries
 in


commodities
 or
 another
 way
 to
 think


about
 it
 is
 short
 duration
 is
 strangely


is
 when
 interest
 rates
 are
 low
 everybody


thinks
 oh
 you
 would
 be
 doing
 capex


cycles
 no
 you
 do
 them
 when
 the
 interest


rates
 are
 high
 because
 the
 interest


rates
 are
 high
 they're
 telling
 you
 you


need
 to
 put
 money
 into
 the
 ground
 and
 so


we're
 moving
 into
 one
 of
 these
 repricing


towards
 assets
 heavy
 industries
 which
 is


why
 it'll
 ultimately
 be
 sustainable


across
 the
 entire
 commodity
 complex.
 And


I
 just
 want
 to
 take
 a
 step
 back
 and
 talk


about
 these
 repricings
 because
 in
 my


career
 I've
 lived
 through
 two.
 The
 first


one
 was
 in
 that
 call
 it
 O2
 through
 like


04
 time
 period
 and
 that's
 when
 we
 coined


the
 term
 revenge
 of
 the
 old
 economy.
 Old


economy
 is
 asset
 heavy
 new
 economy
 is


asset
 light.
 And
 that
 asset
 light
 in
 the


late
 90s
 2000s
 was
 really
 about
 the


scalability
 of
 software.
 You
 don't
 need


to
 have
 put
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 into
 the


ground
 to
 be
 able
 to
 create
 growth.
 And


that
 was
 the
 whole
 asset
 light
 model.


But
 eventually
 we
 ran
 out
 of
 all
 of


these
 heavy
 industries
 that
 you
 need
 to


make
 the
 investments
 in.
 And
 then
 China


came
 on
 the
 scene
 and
 became
 clear
 we


need
 to
 make
 those
 investments.
 And
 that


happened
 over
 that
 decade.
 But
 that


repricing
 rerating
 was
 a
 violent
 process


as
 you
 moved
 out
 of
 new
 economy
 or
 into


the
 old
 economy.
 The
 next
 time
 we
 saw


that
 was
 in
 1415
 where
 we
 moved
 out
 of


the
 old
 economy
 and
 into
 the
 new


economy.


>> Why?
 Because
 it
 was
 clear
 China
 was
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 track.
 And
 if
 you


remember
 that
 time
 period
 we
 go
 through


there
 the
 euro
 went
 from
 like
 1.4
 to


parody
 in
 the
 course
 of
 like
 18
 months.


I
 remember
 the
 period
 oil
 was
 coming


down
 $7
 a
 barrel
 like
 every
 other
 day.


Everybody,
 what's
 going
 on?
 What's
 going


on?
 But
 I
 want
 to
 make
 a
 point
 here
 to


get
 to
 your
 point
 about
 why
 is
 this


sustainable
 across
 all
 these


commodities?
 And
 when
 we
 look
 at
 I'm


going
 to
 take
 a
 like
 a
 private
 equity


pitch
 book
 in
 2012
 of
 a
 Canadian
 oil


asset.
 They
 valued
 the
 asset
 at
 $110


a
 barrel.
 The
 irr
 of
 that
 asset
 that


this
 oil
 field
 was
 25%
 at
 110.
 Now
 fast


forward
 to
 2016
 after
 the
 macro


repricing.
 Oil
 was
 sitting
 around
 $40
 a


barrel.
 Now
 let's
 go
 repric
 the
 irr
 of


that
 asset.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 it
 is?


Immediate
 response
 was
 people
 go,
 "Oh,


it
 was
 negative
 IRR."
 No,
 it
 was
 around


181
 19%.
 It
 didn't
 come
 down
 much.
 Why


is
 because
 the
 Canadian
 dollar
 repric
 so


wages
 went
 down.
 You
 had
 a
 repricing
 of


the
 cost
 of
 capital.
 You
 had
 a
 repricing


of
 copper,
 iron
 ore.
 they
 all
 came
 down


and
 so
 your
 cost
 basis
 came
 down
 such


that
 the
 irr
 was
 far
 more
 stable
 over


that
 repricing
 and
 that's
 ultimately


what
 we're
 starting
 to
 see
 happen
 across


this
 space
 right
 now
 and
 I
 believe
 we're


in
 one
 of
 these
 repricings
 where
 we're


going
 to
 move
 back
 into
 the
 asset
 heavy


space
 I
 want
 to
 make
 one
 last
 point


before
 moving
 on
 this
 during
 this
 it's


going
 to
 make
 this
 one
 really
 different


from
 ones
 in
 the
 past


>> is
 I
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 the
 1960s


because
 it's
 similar
 to
 to
 today
 and


that
 was
 at
 the
 at
 least
 in
 the
 modern


data
 the
 the
 first
 big
 commodity
 super


cycle
 the
 asset
 light
 space
 back
 in
 the


60s
 was
 companies
 like
 Coca-Cola
 in
 fact


all
 the
 nifty50
 were
 brands
 what
 do


brands
 have
 similar
 to
 let's
 say


Microsoft
 infinitely
 scalable
 at
 zero


marginal
 cost
 and
 so
 Coca-Cola
 was
 the


world's
 darling
 right
 now
 and
 all
 of
 the


big
 commodity
 producers
 the
 miners
 the


oil
 companies
 were
 at
 the
 bottom
 and


then
 you
 had
 the
 Arab
 oil
 embargo
 create


that
 catalyst
 to
 repric.
 Now
 what


happened
 here
 is
 that
 that's
 different


today.
 So
 you
 think
 about
 that
 asset


light
 space
 was
 Coca-Cola
 then
 and
 then


in
 then
 in
 in
 2000
 it
 was
 Microsoft
 and


today
 it's
 Google
 and
 the
 hyperscalers.


Now
 here's
 where
 it
 gets
 really


different
 in
 the
 power.
 What's
 going
 to


happen
 now
 is
 the
 asset
 light
 space
 is


getting
 into
 the
 asset
 heavy
 space
 i.e.


These
 hyperscalers
 are
 putting
 steel


into
 the
 ground.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 you're


no
 longer
 a
 asset
 light
 infinitely


scalable
 software
 company.
 You're
 a


minor.
 You're
 a
 oil
 company.
 You
 are
 a


commodity
 producer.
 Your
 multiple
 is


going
 to
 get
 rerated.
 And
 so
 what
 we


have
 is
 the
 asset
 light
 space
 this
 time


is
 moving
 into
 the
 asset
 heavy
 space
 in


putting
 steel
 in
 the
 ground.
 So
 this
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 real
 violent
 transition.


So
 you
 ask
 about
 copper
 and
 silver
 and


the
 rest
 of
 these
 things.
 What
 are
 the


restrictions
 on
 their
 big
 capex
 budgets?


Is
 the
 availability
 of
 transformers.


What
 are
 transformers?
 Big
 chunks
 of


copper.
 And
 so
 we
 have
 a
 difference
 in


this
 cycle
 than
 ones
 in
 the
 past
 is
 the


asset
 light
 space
 is
 colliding
 in
 the


physical
 space
 at
 the
 exact
 same
 time.


Which
 is
 what
 I
 tend
 to
 think
 that
 this


repricing
 is
 going
 to
 be
 more
 violent,


more
 sustainable.
 And
 what
 you're
 going


to
 see,
 and
 it
 goes
 to
 a
 simple
 point


that
 I
 observed
 in
 the
 2000s,
 was
 when


oil
 first
 went
 up
 because
 oh,
 it's
 a


bunch
 of
 investors
 buying
 oil,
 it
 sits


at
 $60
 a
 barrel.
 That's
 supernatural


returns.
 No,
 you
 actually
 had
 capital


rotate
 out
 of
 the
 asset
 light
 space
 and


into
 the
 oil
 space
 during
 0405
 such
 that


the
 cost
 basis
 actually
 rose
 and
 there


was
 no
 supernatural
 return.
 So
 go
 Tracy,


back
 to
 your
 point,
 how
 sustainable
 is


this?
 Well,
 what
 we're
 seeing
 is
 all
 the


capital
 flowing
 into
 this
 asset
 heavy


space
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 fill
 the
 ground


underneath
 these
 prices
 and
 support
 them


from
 a
 relative
 cost
 basis.
 And
 so
 when


we
 think
 about
 $14,000
 a
 ton
 copper,


doesn't
 mean
 these
 guys
 are
 earning


supernatural
 returns
 because
 we
 see
 so


much
 capital
 moving
 into
 the
 space.


[music]


[music]


I
 absolutely
 love
 that
 comparison
 of
 the


software
 companies
 to
 the
 Coca-Cas.
 and


this
 idea
 that
 like
 there
 are
 certain


business
 models
 that
 can
 scale


incredibly
 with
 very
 little
 physical


needs
 and
 I
 the
 way
 you
 frame
 that
 I


thought
 was
 uh
 very
 helpful
 to


understand
 and
 we've
 certainly
 talked
 a


lot
 on
 the
 podcast
 about
 the


hyperscalers
 getting
 into
 the
 real


business
 of
 things
 and
 you
 know
 going
 up


the
 chain
 and
 in
 some
 cases
 getting
 you


know
 getting
 into
 the
 power
 production


investing
 in
 their
 own
 nuclear
 plants


and
 hiring
 power
 traders.
 So
 all
 of
 this


feels
 very
 real.
 Let's
 just
 like
 you
 say


we're
 in
 a
 super
 cycle.
 You
 say
 we're
 at


the
 foothills
 of
 the
 Himalayas.
 What


does
 history
 or
 your
 work
 say
 about
 how


big
 and
 how
 far
 this
 can
 go?


>> Well,
 I
 mean
 historically
 these
 cycles


last
 somewhere
 around
 12
 years.
 The
 one


in
 the
 70s
 did.
 The
 one
 in
 the
 2000s


did.
 The
 one
 in
 the
 '7s
 from
 ' 68
 to


1980.
 The
 one
 in
 the
 2000s
 from


essentially
 2002
 to
 2014.
 A
 lot
 of


people
 say,
 "Oh,
 the
 world's
 different


today
 than
 any
 of
 those
 other
 points


time."
 Putting
 steel
 in
 the
 ground
 still


takes
 about
 the
 same
 amount
 of
 time.


Technology
 or
 no
 technology.
 I
 like
 to


point
 out
 where
 do
 you
 get
 the
 the
 12


years?
 You
 the
 first
 three
 years
 are


getting
 people
 to
 believe
 it


>> before
 they
 they
 start
 to
 really
 invest


earnestly.
 And
 I
 would
 say
 this
 one


started
 in
 2020.
 And
 so
 the
 fact
 that
 we


lost
 two
 years
 in
 23
 and
 25
 whether
 it


was
 copper
 or
 oil
 and
 part
 of
 the
 reason


for
 that
 was
 the
 rally
 in
 prices
 was
 so


steep
 after
 that
 Russian
 Ukrainian


invasion
 that
 the
 policy
 response


globally
 was
 incredibly
 swift.
 I
 want
 to


point
 out
 that
 policy
 response
 in
 22
 and


23
 was
 not
 so
 much
 the
 rise
 in
 interest


rates
 but
 the
 creation
 of
 supply.
 And
 I


say
 that
 is
 because
 you
 had
 inflation


come
 down
 everywhere
 in
 the
 world
 in
 a


synchronous
 manner.
 And
 it
 did
 it


against
 record
 commodity
 demand
 and


really
 strong
 GDP
 growth
 in
 the
 United


States.
 What
 does
 that
 tell
 you?
 It


simply
 could
 not
 have
 been
 interest


rates
 and
 the
 demand
 side.
 It
 had
 to


come
 from
 a
 supply
 side.
 Where
 did
 they


get
 new
 supply?
 Russia,
 Iran,
 Venezuela.


you
 know,
 some
 of
 the
 issues
 that
 are


facing
 a
 state,
 they
 got
 it
 through


increased
 immigration
 on
 on
 the
 labor


side.
 There
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 ways
 they


created
 supply
 all
 over
 the
 world
 to
 be


able
 to
 deal
 with
 that.
 Now,
 the
 point


this
 time
 around,
 and
 everybody's
 bought


into
 this
 oil
 supply
 gut,
 we
 don't
 have


a
 problem,
 is
 that
 those
 easy
 fixes
 are


not
 going
 to
 be
 available
 next
 time


around.
 So,
 this
 one's
 going
 to
 take


longer
 than
 normal.
 But
 I
 also
 want
 to


go
 why
 I'm
 comfortable
 with
 this
 being
 a


super
 cycle
 is
 all
 of
 these
 things
 are


all
 policydriven.


The
 one
 in
 the
 70s
 was
 due
 to
 the
 LBJ's


war
 on
 poverty,
 the
 big
 defense


spending.
 Sound
 familiar?
 And
 then
 you


had
 the
 Arab
 oil
 embargo.
 If
 you
 look
 at


what
 happened
 in
 the
 2000s,
 it
 was
 the


decision
 to
 admit
 China
 and the
 WTO,
 a


policy
 decision.
 um
 here
 the
 policy


decisions
 is
 the
 war
 on
 free
 trade
 and


it's
 not
 just
 the
 US
 doing
 it


everybody's
 doing
 it
 you
 know
 curtailing


commodity
 supply
 around
 the
 world
 in


fact
 the
 three
 points
 we
 laid
 out
 in


2020
 in
 fact
 it
 was
 on
 this
 show
 we
 laid


them
 out
 they're
 still
 very
 much
 valid


today
 and
 they
 were
 all
 policy
 decisions


one
 was
 del
 globalization
 the
 war
 on


free
 trade
 I
 mean
 if
 anything
 it's
 been


turbocharged
 now
 from
 5
 years
 ago
 and


when
 we
 think
 about
 it
 it's
 all
 policy


decisions
 and
 it's
 not
 just
 inside
 the


United
 States
 where
 we're
 seeing
 this,


you
 know,
 the
 Chinese
 cutting
 critical


mineral
 supply,
 you
 know,
 Europeans


focused
 on,
 you
 know,
 protecting


themselves,
 defense
 spending,
 the
 list


goes
 on.
 Let's
 go
 to
 the
 second
 one
 at


the
 time,
 decarbonization
 or


electrification.
 And
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 going
 to
 look
 at,
 oh,
 well,


didn't
 the
 US
 backtrack
 on
 that
 with,


you
 know,
 the
 recent
 political
 shifts?


The
 answer
 is
 absolutely
 not.
 the
 rest


of
 the
 world
 is
 doubling
 down
 on


electrification
 for
 both
 when
 we
 think


about
 the
 electrification
 of
 the
 world


where
 it
 wasn't
 decarbonization
 was
 not


the
 motivator
 today
 it
 wasn't
 then
 and


then
 going
 back
 in
 time
 why
 do
 I
 say


that
 why
 did
 China
 build
 cutting
 edge


technologies
 and
 nuclear
 power
 solar


wind
 batteries
 and
 the
 rest
 of
 it
 they


did
 it
 for
 energy
 security
 kind
 of
 goes


into
 the
 deglobalization
 point
 they
 want


their
 own
 secure
 energy
 supply
 in
 fact


Carter


coined
 the
 term
 energy
 transition
 and


wanted
 to
 transition
 out
 of
 oil
 into


renewables
 in
 1977
 not
 because
 they


wanted
 to
 save
 the
 world
 but
 because
 of


energy
 security.
 One
 last
 point
 on
 this


is
 France
 lowest
 carbon
 footprint
 in
 the


world.
 It
 didn't
 get
 there
 because
 it


wanted
 to
 save
 the
 planet.
 It
 got
 there


because
 it
 wanted
 nuclear
 power
 so
 it


could
 it
 was
 Charles
 de
 Gaul
 decision
 to


rid
 itself
 of
 the
 oil
 trade.
 So
 this


story
 regardless
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 in


the
 political
 push
 back
 and
 I
 don't


think
 green
 was
 ever
 probably
 the
 right


way
 to
 phrase
 this.
 You
 know
 it's


renewable.
 It's
 a
 secure
 source.
 Nuclear


power
 is
 a
 secure
 source.
 Throw
 data


centers
 AI
 all
 on
 top
 of
 it.
 It's


turbocharged
 from
 the
 last
 time
 we


talked
 about.
 And
 then
 finally
 the
 third


point
 was
 redistribution
 or
 the
 war
 on


income
 inequality.


>> Yeah
 K
 with
 the
 K
 economy.
 This
 is
 alive


and
 kicking.


Wait,
 say
 more
 about
 that
 last
 point.


>> Well,
 when
 we
 think
 about
 commodities,


and
 actually
 Tracy,
 you
 I've
 seen
 you


even
 make
 this
 point
 that
 I
 made
 back


five
 years
 ago
 was
 that


>> when
 you
 see
 inflation
 and
 you
 see


commodity
 demand,
 it
 has
 to
 be
 coming


from
 the
 low
 income
 groups.
 This
 is
 a


point
 I
 think
 people
 get
 backwards,


right?


>> Inflation
 is
 bad
 for
 the
 high
 income


groups.
 And
 the
 reason
 why
 is
 because


the
 low


>> This
 was
 a
 great
 call
 that
 you
 made,
 by


the
 way.
 Yeah.
 And
 the
 lowincome
 groups


are
 the
 ones
 that
 actually
 think
 about


this
 corn.
 A
 highinccome
 person
 will


consume
 the
 same
 amount
 of
 corn
 at
 any


point
 in
 time.
 The
 marginal
 demand
 has


to
 come
 from
 the
 low
 income
 groups.
 And


so
 when
 you
 give
 them
 money
 like
 fiscal


transfers
 and
 you
 know
 to
 keep
 the


masses
 happy
 in
 certain
 situations,
 what


are
 they
 going
 to
 do?
 They're
 going
 to


spend
 it.
 They're
 going
 to
 spend
 it
 on


commodities
 and
 physical
 goods
 and
 that


ends
 up
 creating
 that
 inflation.
 And


then
 the
 high
 income
 people
 suffer


because
 the
 visit
 the
 response
 by
 policy


makers
 to
 the
 higher
 rates
 is
 wealth


comes
 down.
 And
 another
 way
 to
 think


about
 all
 inflation
 is
 is
 a
 wealth


transfer
 between
 the
 high
 income
 groups


and
 the
 low
 income
 groups
 and
 then
 they


go
 out
 and
 spend
 it.
 And
 so
 when
 we


think
 about
 the
 demand
 here
 is
 that


third
 one
 which
 is
 this
 war
 on
 income


inequality.
 is
 just
 going
 to
 demand
 more


and
 more
 types
 of
 transfers
 to
 the
 lower


income
 groups
 to
 be
 able
 to
 deal
 with


the
 civil
 unrest
 and
 and
 it's
 alive
 and


kicking
 everywhere
 in
 the
 world
 right


now.
 And
 so
 I
 I
 would
 assume
 you
 know


the
 you
 know
 if
 you
 liked
 any
 of
 these


three
 stories
 back
 in
 2020
 you
 got
 to


love
 them
 today.


Just
 going
 back
 to
 the
 super
 cycle


thesis
 and
 the
 role
 of
 policy,
 how
 do
 we


know
 that
 the
 importance
 of
 a
 lot
 of


these
 metals,
 the
 strategic
 importance,


how
 do
 we
 know
 that
 that
 won't
 end
 up


increasing
 supply
 faster
 than
 we
 expect?


You
 know,
 part
 of
 the
 story,
 especially


in
 copper,
 is
 that
 it's
 not
 that
 many


people
 are
 pulling
 it
 out
 of
 the
 ground


anymore.
 It
 takes
 forever
 to
 get
 a
 new


mine
 started.
 How
 do
 we
 know
 that


governments
 aren't
 just
 going
 to
 make
 it


easier
 to
 get
 this
 stuff
 and
 so
 you'll


see
 a
 supply
 response
 faster
 than


perhaps
 you
 saw
 previously?


>> Let's
 go
 back
 to
 my
 point.
 You
 know,


these
 are
 12
 year
 cycles.
 It's
 just


putting
 steel
 in
 the
 ground
 takes
 a
 long


time.
 Even
 if
 you
 got
 rid
 of
 all
 the


bureaucracy
 and
 red
 tape,
 it's
 going
 to


take
 time.
 But
 let's
 go
 to
 the
 critical


minerals.
 Why
 does
 China
 dominate
 these?


They
 did
 it
 because
 the
 Soviets
 and
 the


Americans
 didn't
 want
 to
 touch
 the


downstream
 processes
 because
 of
 not
 in


my
 backyard
 for
 nimi
 reasons.
 I
 mean,


even
 the
 Soviets,
 let
 me
 remind
 I
 say


the
 Soviets
 because
 this
 decision
 was


made
 in
 the
 70s.
 Remember
 when
 the
 EPA,


the
 super
 fun
 sites
 and
 all
 of
 that,
 the


Americans
 and
 the
 Soviets
 used
 to
 do


this.
 They
 quit
 doing
 it
 and
 farmed
 it


out
 to
 the
 Chinese
 because
 they
 didn't


like
 doing
 it
 in
 their
 backyards.
 This


these
 are
 really
 highly
 toxic
 processes.


And
 so
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 onshore
 them


and
 bring
 them
 back,
 you've
 got
 to


figure
 out
 technologies
 to
 do
 this
 in
 a


way
 that's
 going
 to
 deal
 with
 those
 nimi


problems
 that
 people
 didn't
 want
 to
 deal


with
 50
 years
 ago.
 Um
 so
 it's
 going
 to


be
 very
 expensive,
 time
 consuming.


There's
 ways
 to
 get
 around
 it,
 but
 it,


you
 know,
 whether
 I
 heard,
 you
 know,
 you


can
 build
 these
 facilities
 on
 army
 land


in
 the
 United
 States,
 you
 don't
 get
 any


of
 the
 bureaucracy
 around
 environmental


problems.
 But
 even
 so,
 and
 the
 last


thing
 you
 this
 stuff
 you
 do,
 you you


know,
 if
 you
 didn't
 like
 it
 in
 the
 70s,


you're
 still
 not
 going
 to
 like
 it
 today.


Um,
 so
 I
 it's
 not
 something
 that
 can
 be


resolved
 overnight.
 It's
 going
 to
 take
 a


long
 time.
 It's
 going
 to
 take
 an


enormous
 amount
 of
 capital,
 new


technologies,
 created,
 rerouting
 supply


chains
 around
 the
 world.
 That's
 why
 I


say
 that
 we're
 at
 just
 the
 tip
 of
 the


iceberg
 on
 what
 needs
 to
 be
 done
 here,


which
 is
 why
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 go


on,
 you
 know,
 for
 at least
 another


decade.
 And
 I
 mean
 one
 last
 point
 about


the
 super
 cycle
 the
 70s
 and
 the
 one
 in


the
 in
 the
 2000s.
 They
 were
 sequences
 of


price
 spikes.
 They
 weren't
 a
 steady


upward
 trend.
 You
 had
 one
 in
 73,
 another


one
 in
 7778
 and
 another
 one
 in
 80.
 In


the
 2000s
 you
 had
 one
 in
 ' 0405,
 another


one
 in
 ' 08,
 and
 then
 the
 final
 finale


in
 11
 late
 10
 and
 11.
 It
 was
 with
 Libya


and
 then
 copper
 topped
 11,000.
 So


everybody
 thinks
 they're
 like
 this


steady
 upward
 trend
 in
 prices
 and


assets.
 The
 reality
 is
 their
 sequence
 of


price
 spikes
 and
 this
 one
 will
 be
 more


bubbly
 in
 nature.


>> Right?


>> I
 like
 to
 say
 it's
 a
 bubbling
 cauldron


of
 supply
 and
 demand
 imbalances.
 And
 in


part
 of
 this
 is
 because
 of
 what
 happened


with
 the
 surge
 in
 investment
 around


let's
 call
 it
 the
 green
 investment


around
 net
 zero
 2050.
 I
 like
 to
 say
 that


that
 investment
 occurred
 from
 around


2015
 through
 about
 2122.


It
 created
 an
 environment
 where
 you
 have


lots
 of
 let's
 say
 renewable
 wind
 in


places
 like
 Germany
 or
 Spain,
 but
 you


don't
 have
 the
 batteries,
 the
 grid
 and


the
 rest
 of
 it.
 So
 what
 that
 creates
 is


these
 pockets
 where
 you
 can
 see
 big


shifts
 where
 you
 have
 negative
 prices
 of


power
 at
 some
 point,
 explosive
 prices
 on


the
 other
 side.
 So
 the
 one
 thing
 about


this
 time
 around,
 it's
 going
 to
 create


much
 higher
 levels
 of
 volatility
 across


the
 commodity
 space.
 I
 think
 silver,
 you


can
 see
 you're
 getting
 through
 these


pockets
 where
 it'll
 go
 up
 and
 down.
 And


you
 know,
 whether
 if
 it
 was
 California


Power
 in
 the
 2000s
 and
 that
 that


commodity
 cycle,
 which
 sure
 reminds
 me


what
 silver
 is
 doing
 today,
 is
 you
 end


up
 with
 an
 environment
 in
 which
 the


volatility
 gets
 higher.


>> The
 volatility
 then
 scares
 investors


away.
 The
 lack
 of
 investment
 then


reinforces
 the
 higher
 volatility.
 And
 I


think
 that
 that
 dynamic
 in
 this
 bubbling


cauldron
 of
 supply
 and
 demand
 imbalances


is
 just
 going
 to
 be
 that
 much
 more


vicious
 this
 time
 around
 than
 in
 the


past.


>> Jeff,
 you're
 my
 favorite
 person
 to
 talk


to
 about
 commodities.
 But
 my
 second


favorite
 person
 to
 talk
 to
 about


commodities
 is
 the
 Uber
 driver
 that
 I


had
 in
 2022
 [clears throat]
 who
 when
 he


was
 dropping
 me
 off
 at
 Bloomberg,
 and
 I


mentioned
 this
 on
 a
 previous
 episode,


he's
 like,
 "Oh,
 I
 have a
 thesis.
 some


really
 long
 silver
 because
 it
 has
 all


these
 industrial
 uses,
 but
 silver
 is


frequently
 mined
 as
 a
 byproduct
 of


copper
 production
 and
 there
 isn't
 a
 lot


of
 new
 copper
 production
 happening
 at


this
 current
 state
 and
 therefore
 we're


not
 going
 to
 see
 a
 big
 supply
 response


be
 elicited
 on
 the
 silver
 side
 and
 so


you're
 going
 to
 get
 this
 mega
 squeeze.


So
 he's
 my
 second
 favorite
 one.
 That
 was


2022.
 now
 in
 January
 2026.
 I
 mean


clearly
 the
 price
 was
 right
 but
 this


phenomenon
 as
 he
 described
 it
 does
 that


sound
 uh
 pretty
 accurate
 to
 you?


>> Absolutely.
 I
 mean
 with
 all
 of
 these


it's
 by
 the
 way
 you
 you
 can
 get
 the


supply.
 It's
 not
 a
 scarcity
 of
 the


commodities
 whether
 if
 it's
 critical,


metal,
 even
 copper.
 It's
 like
 it's
 the


access.
 It's
 it
 is
 the
 political
 access


to
 where
 the
 resources,
 but
 more


importantly,
 it's
 the
 willingness
 of


capital
 to
 provide
 the
 money.
 I
 like
 to


say
 it's
 not
 about
 the
 supply
 and
 demand


of
 the
 molecules
 or
 of
 the
 metric
 tons


or
 the
 bushels.
 It's
 about
 the
 supply


and
 demand
 of
 the
 capital
 used
 to
 create


the
 production.
 Therein
 lies
 the
 core


problem.
 And
 the
 capital
 has
 not
 moved


in.
 So
 Tracy,
 back
 to
 your
 point,
 how


long
 does
 it
 go?
 We
 haven't
 even
 moved


the
 capital
 in
 yet.
 The
 capital
 is
 still


sitting
 in
 the
 new
 economy
 or
 asset


light
 world.
 And
 the
 returns,
 you
 know,


by
 the
 way,
 I've
 asked
 people,
 I
 go,


like
 this
 was
 in
 like
 23,
 24.
 I
 go,
 hey,


why
 don't
 you
 want
 to
 put
 money
 into


these
 these
 this
 space?
 The
 answer
 was,


Jeff,
 I
 agree
 with
 your
 story.
 The


problem
 is
 the
 tech
 space
 is
 providing


such
 very
 good
 returns
 that
 if
 I
 am


underweight
 the
 space
 I
 got
 a
 problem


and
 I
 rather
 be
 putting
 the
 money
 into


what's
 out
 before
 me.
 That
 was
 the
 case


in
 23
 24
 25.


>> Just
 to
 be
 clear
 since
 the
 last
 time
 we


talked
 to
 you
 there
 has
 not
 been
 a
 ton


of
 activity
 in
 terms
 of
 let's
 actually


start
 digging.
 No,
 because
 the
 pullback


in
 late
 22
 and
 early
 23
 was
 so
 vicious


across
 this
 entire
 space.


>> Yeah.


>> That
 the
 money
 they
 looked
 at
 it
 go,
 I


got
 beaten
 up.
 You
 know,
 Curry,
 you
 told


me
 to
 go
 in
 back
 in
 20
 and
 21,
 worked


for
 about
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half,
 I
 got


absolutely
 cremated
 on
 the
 backside.
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 do
 that
 again.
 And
 so,
 they


got
 beaten
 up
 over
 that
 time
 period.


Their
 willingness
 to
 go
 back
 in
 and


believe
 the
 story
 is
 not
 that
 high.


They're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 it.
 And
 now


that's
 moves
 so
 quick,
 so
 fast
 like
 it


did
 in
 22
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 look
 at


it
 and
 go,
 "Oh,
 I've
 missed
 it."
 And
 I


think,
 you
 know,
 it's
 like
 Tracy's
 point


is
 how
 how
 much
 further
 this
 go?
 How


sustainable
 is
 it?
 And
 I
 think
 the
 key


point
 there
 is
 it's
 got
 it's
 that


volatility
 is
 discouraging
 them.
 Yeah.


And
 that's
 why
 I
 tend
 to
 think
 what
 is


going
 to
 force
 the
 money
 into
 this
 space


is
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 have
 the


returns
 in
 the
 asset
 light
 tech
 or


whatever
 you
 want
 to
 call
 it
 world
 get


to
 a
 point
 that
 they're
 go
 looking
 at


the
 old
 economy
 going
 I'm
 willing
 to


take
 that
 risk
 and
 go
 in
 it
 because


that's
 the
 only
 place
 that
 has
 returns.


And
 when
 they
 do
 that
 that's
 when
 you're


going
 to
 end
 up
 seeing
 the
 rotation.
 And


I
 also
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 a
 point
 here


is
 the
 market
 is
 so
 severely
 underweight


all
 of
 this
 stuff
 cuz
 it's
 been
 so
 hated


for
 so
 long
 that
 when
 the
 money
 rotates


>> anti-
 gold
 bug
 [laughter]


>> but
 when
 the
 money
 rotates
 it
 it's
 going


to
 be
 playing
 catchup.
 Whether
 if
 it's,


you
 know,
 the
 two
 and
 a
 half
 percent


waiting
 of
 energy
 in
 the
 S&P
 500
 versus


what
 a
 seven
 or
 eight
 percent
 waiting
 on


revenues,
 the
 market
 cap
 is
 too
 small


and
 whether
 if
 it's
 in
 metals
 and
 mining


critical,
 these
 things
 are
 just
 so
 tiny.


It's
 like
 we
 I
 was
 talking
 the
 other


day,
 you
 take
 FCX
 and
 let's
 see
 Ivanho


Mines
 and
 some
 of
 the
 other
 smaller


copper
 producers
 and
 what
 is
 their


market
 cap
 is
 is
 altogether
 200
 billion


versus
 Nvidia
 at
 4
 a.5
 trillion.
 Now
 all


a
 sudden
 you
 take
 that
 money
 out
 there


and
 it
 has
 to
 go
 chase
 this
 space.
 And


so
 you're
 asking
 how
 high
 can
 it
 go?
 you


can
 go
 really
 high
 because
 you're


talking
 about
 moving
 trillions
 of


dollars
 out
 of
 asset
 light
 into
 asset


heavy
 when
 nothing's
 been
 here
 for
 over


a
 decade.


>> Jeeoff,
 very
 very
 quickly,
 are
 there
 any


risks
 to
 the
 structural
 super
 cycle


thesis?
 Is
 there
 any
 indicator
 that


you're
 watching
 to
 suggest
 that
 okay


maybe
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 happen
 or
 maybe


it's
 not
 going
 to
 happen
 at
 the
 moment


that
 you're
 currently
 predicting?
 I
 I


first
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 the


difference
 between
 equities
 and


commodities.
 Commodities
 are
 driven
 by


the
 real
 physical
 supply
 and
 demand
 and


equities
 in
 financial
 markets
 are
 driven


by
 expectations.
 Expectations
 can
 or


cannot
 happen.
 I
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


what
 the
 next
 person's
 going
 to
 do
 and


what
 they're
 going
 to
 buy
 actually
 can


be
 modeled
 and
 thought
 through,
 but
 it's


less
 predictable.
 Long-term
 supply
 and


demand
 balances
 of
 commodities,
 you


know,
 when
 you
 have
 a
 problem.
 By
 the


way,
 people
 don't
 push
 back.
 I
 mean,


when
 I
 think
 I
 said
 on
 the
 last
 time


here,
 copper
 is
 the
 best
 trade
 I've
 seen


in
 terms
 of
 fundamentals.
 Stan
 Duck


Miller
 recently,
 he
 made
 the
 same


comment
 that,
 hey,
 it's
 tight.
 Yeah,


it's
 really
 tight,
 but
 it
 may
 not
 work


today,
 tomorrow,
 the
 next
 day.
 I
 know
 if


I
 sit
 on
 the
 position
 and
 hold
 it
 long


enough,
 eventually
 you'll
 get
 to
 that


point
 where
 it
 does
 pay
 out
 because,
 you


know,
 the
 physical
 supply
 and
 demand,


the
 rubber
 meets
 the
 road,
 and
 you
 see


the
 the
 rise
 in
 prices.
 Now
 the
 question


is
 can
 you
 stay
 liquid
 long
 enough


before
 that
 event
 occurs.
 So
 first
 of


all
 the
 reason
 why
 I'm
 so
 confident
 into


these
 stories
 is
 the
 forward
 on
 these


markets
 are
 incredibly
 unbalanced


whether
 if
 it
 is
 in
 copper
 you
 know
 the


industrial
 metals
 you
 know
 the
 critical


minerals
 oil
 all
 of
 them
 are
 really


imbalanced
 because
 so
 that's
 the
 thesis


why
 my
 confidence
 now
 what
 is
 the


near-term
 risk
 it's
 not
 that
 you
 know


that
 you're
 going
 to
 because
 we're
 going


to
 electrify
 the
 world
 you
 don't
 have


enough
 copper
 to
 electrify
 the
 world
 the


risk
 is
 like
 the
 demand
 for
 in
 housing


demand
 in
 China
 collapses,
 but
 that


happened
 in
 23
 and
 24.
 So,
 you've


already
 paid
 the
 price
 on
 that
 one.
 So,


when
 I
 think
 about
 these
 risks
 that


you're
 talking
 about,
 they
 might
 come


from
 the
 demand
 side
 because
 you
 cannot


create
 supply
 from
 thin
 air.
 So,
 it
 has


to
 be
 demand
 coming
 down.
 But
 that


demand
 coming
 down
 just
 ultimately


delays
 how
 long
 it'll
 take
 before
 you


run
 into
 problems.
 The
 main
 reason
 why


copper
 didn't
 perform
 in
 that
 23
 24
 time


frame
 is
 we
 underestimated
 the
 severity


of
 the
 property
 contraction
 in
 China.


And
 part
 of
 that
 was
 the
 high
 interest


rates
 west
 forced
 the
 Chinese
 to
 keep


interest
 rates
 too
 high
 because
 they
 had


to
 prevent
 capital
 outflow
 and
 as
 a


result
 it
 really
 hurt
 that
 property


sector.
 So
 that
 would
 be,
 you
 know,
 the


it's
 it's
 different
 than
 the
 the
 the


financial
 markets
 because
 the


expectations
 [music]
 can
 change
 on
 a


moment
 and
 they're
 hard
 to
 forecast.


Bottom
 line,
 you
 need
 this
 investment.


>> Jeff
 Curry,
 perfect
 guest,
 perfect
 day.


Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 coming
 back
 on


OddLocks.


>> Great.
 Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.
 It's


quite
 enjoyable.


>> Truly
 the
 perfect
 guest
 and
 congrats
 on


uh
 all
 your
 structural
 thesis
 that
 seem


[music]
 to
 be
 playing
 out.


>> Great.
 Thanks.
 [laughter]
 Take
 care


y'all.


>> [music]


[music]


>> I
 love
 that.
 I
 mean,
 Jeff's


[clears throat]
 just
 the
 best.


>> He's
 so
 good.


>> I'm
 so
 glad
 we
 could
 get
 him
 on
 today
 in


particular.
 I
 should
 just
 mention
 we're


recording
 on
 January
 29th.
 The
 price
 of


metals
 is
 going
 up
 so
 quickly.
 Who
 knows


what
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 tomorrow.
 I
 think


the
 most
 po
 I
 mean
 there
 are
 so
 many


powerful
 ideas
 and
 compelling
 notions.


To
 my
 mind
 one
 of
 the
 strongest
 ideas


that
 I
 think
 is
 sort
 of
 under
 discussed


in
 the
 debate
 is
 the
 intersection
 of
 the


commodity
 rally
 and
 the
 war
 on
 free


trade
 right
 and
 you
 know
 we
 look
 at


things
 they're
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 more


expensive
 here
 people
 sort
 of
 look
 like


oh
 is
 the
 tariffs
 being
 passed
 through


etc.
 But
 this
 deeper
 dynamic
 that
 if
 you


don't
 have
 a
 world
 of
 sort
 of
 relatively


open
 trade,
 then
 that
 forces
 everyone
 to


stockpile
 and
 that
 forces
 everyone
 to


build
 their
 own
 version.
 And
 that
 all


I'm
 going
 to
 build
 a
 chip
 plant
 here
 and


I'm
 going to
 build
 a
 chip
 plant
 there


and
 I'm
 going
 to
 build
 a
 chip
 plant


there
 because
 we're
 also
 worried
 you


have
 that
 duplication
 that
 it's
 the
 war


on
 free
 trade
 that
 whether
 it's
 public


or
 private
 forces
 all
 of
 this
 commodity


intensive
 spending.


>> Yeah.
 All
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 is
 it's
 good


to
 hold
 gold
 and
 silver
 coins.


>> Stop
 rubbing
 it
 in.
 Stop
 rubbing.
 Stop


[laughter]
 rubbing.


>> Well,
 the
 problem
 is
 it
 feels
 good.


>> It
 feels
 good.
 But
 well,
 that's
 the


thing.
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 how
 to
 sell.


Like
 I
 would
 have
 to
 carry
 a
 bunch
 of


gold
 coins
 through
 New
 York
 and
 find
 a


dealer
 or
 something.


>> You
 know what?
 We
 need
 to
 take
 another


trip
 through
 the
 uh
 Diamond
 District


where
 there
 are
 plenty
 of
 signs
 on
 their


windows.
 We
 buy
 gold
 and
 so
 forth.


>> Well,
 I
 would
 actually
 do
 an
 episode
 on


buying
 physical
 gold.
 Let's
 do
 an


episode
 on
 selling
 physical
 gold.
 Yeah.


>> Like,
 how
 do
 you
 actually
 do
 that?
 Are


there
 certain
 ways
 to
 do
 it
 that
 are


better
 than
 others
 and
 all
 of
 that?


>> I
 totally
 do
 that.


>> Let's
 do
 it.
 That
 sounds
 like
 a
 great


episode.


>> I
 have
 a
 silver
 bar
 somewhere,
 too.
 I


need
 to
 find
 that.


>> I
 like
 uh
 I


>> I'm
 going
 to
 bring
 it
 in
 and
 use
 it
 as
 a


paper
 weight
 just
 to
 annoy
 you.


>> Well,
 I
 have
 my
 uh
 I
 have
 my
 uh
 what's


it
 called?
 The
 not
 the
 um
 what's
 that


metal
 that
 I
 have
 my
 tungsten
 cube


>> that
 metal
 that
 you
 were
 obsessed
 with


and
 now
 you've
 forgotten.
 I
 should
 have


asked
 if
 that's
 my
 one
 that's
 my
 main


exposure
 to
 hard
 assets
 is
 that
 tungsten


cube
 that
 I
 use
 paper
 weight
 I
 think
 so


I
 mean
 he
 said
 every
 element
 in
 the
 he


said
 the
 the
 story
 is
 that
 if
 it's
 an


element
 in
 the
 periodic
 table
 it's
 gone


up
 in
 price
 and
 I
 actually
 think


tungsten
 has
 gone
 up
 quite
 a
 bit
 in
 uh


price
 but
 I
 didn't
 exactly
 buy
 in
 size
 I


think
 my
 cube
 cost
 about
 $300
 or


something
 like
 that
 but


>> okay
 um
