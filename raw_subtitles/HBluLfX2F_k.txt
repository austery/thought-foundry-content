- Some things are not normal.
By that I mean if you go out in the world
and start measuring things
like human height, IQ
or the size of apples on a tree,
you will find that for each
of these things, most of the data clusters
around some average value.
This is so common that we call
it the normal distribution,
but some things in life are not like this
- Nature shows
power laws all over the place.
That seems weird, like is nature tuning
itself to criticality?
- If you make a crude measure of
how big is the world war by
how many people it kills, you find
that it follows a power law.
The outcome will vary in size over
10 million, a hundred
million.
- It's a much more likelihood of really big
events than you would expect from
a normal distribution,
and they will totally skew
the average.
- The system you're looking at doesn't have any
inherent physical scale.
It's really hard to know
what's gonna happen next.
- The more you measure,
the bigger the average
is, which is really weird.
It sounds impossible.
- It's, it's very important to
try to understand, you know,
which game you're playing
and what are the payoffs going
to be in the, in the long run.
- In the late 1800s,
Italian engineer Vilfredo Pareto,
stumbled upon something
no one had seen before.
See, he suspected there
might be a hidden pattern in
how much money people make.
So he gathered income tax
records from Italy, England,
France, and other European countries,
and for each country he plotted
the distribution of income.
Each country he looked at,
he saw the same pattern,
a pattern which still holds
in most countries to this day,
and it's not a normal distribution.
If you think about a normal
distribution like height,
there's a clearly defined average
and extreme outliers
basically never happen.
I mean, you are never
going to find someone
who is say five times the average height.
That would be physically impossible,
but Pareto's income
distributions were different.
Take this curve for England,
it shows the number of people
who earn more than a certain income.
The curve starts off declining steeply,
most people earn relatively little,
but then it falls away gradually
much more slowly than a
normal distribution would,
and it spans several orders of magnitude.
There were people who
earned five times, 10 times,
even a hundred times more than others.
That kind of spread just
wouldn't happen if income were
normally distributed.
Now to shrink this huge spread of data,
Pareto calculated the
logarithms of all the values
and plotted those instead.
In other words, he used a log log plot,
and when he did that, the
broad curve transformed
into a straight line.
The gradient was around negative 1.5.
That means each time
you double the income,
say from 200 pounds to
400 pounds, the number
of people earning at least that
amount drops off by a factor
of two to the power of
1.5, which is around 2.8.
And this pattern holds for
every doubling of income.
So Pareto could describe
the distribution of incomes
with one simple equation.
The number of people who
earn an income greater than
or equal to x is proportional
to one over x to the power
of 1.5.
Now, that's what Pareto saw for England.
But he performed the same
analysis on data from Italy,
France, Prussia, and a
bunch of other countries,
and he saw the same thing again and again.
Each time the data transformed
into a straight line
and the gradients were remarkably similar.
That meant Pareto could describe
the income distribution in
each country with the same
equation, one over the income
to some power where that power
is just the absolute gradient
of the logarithmic graph.
This type of relationship
is called a power law.
When you move from the world
of normal distributions
to the world of power laws,
things change dramatically.
So to illustrate this, let's
take a trip to the casino
to play three different games.
At table number one, you
get 100 tosses of a coin.
Each time you flip and it
lands on heads, you win $1.
So the question is, how
much would you be prepared
to pay to play this game?
Well, we need to work
out how much you'd expect
to win in this game
and then pay less than
that expected value.
So the probability of throwing
ahead is one half, multiply
that by $1 and multiply
that by a hundred tosses.
That gives you an expected payout of $50.
So you should be willing
to pay anything less than
$50 to play this game.
Sure, you might not win every time,
but if you play the
game hundreds of times,
the small variations either side
of the average will cancel out
and you can expect to turn a profit.
One of the first people to study this kind
of problem was Abraham de
Moivre in the early 1700s.
He showed that if you plot the
probability of each outcome,
you get a bell-shaped curve,
which was later coined
the normal distribution,
- Normal distributions.
The traditional explanation
is that when there are a lot
of effects that are
random that are adding up,
that's when you expect normals.
So like how tall I am depends on a lot
of random things about my
nutrition, about my parents',
genetics, all kinds of things.
But, but if they, if these
random effects are additive, that
is what tends to lead to normals.
- At table number two, there's
a slightly different game.
You still get 100 tosses of the coin,
but this time, instead
of potentially winning
a dollar on each flip,
your winnings are
multiplied by some factor.
So you start out with $1
and then every time you toss a head,
you multiply your winnings by 1.1.
If instead the coin lands on tails,
you multiply your winnings by 0.9 and
after a hundred tosses,
you take home the total
that is the dollar.
You started with times the
string of 1.1s
and 0.9s.
So how much should you
pay to play this game?
Well, on each flip, your payout
can either grow or shrink
and each is equally likely
each time you toss the coin.
So the expected factor,
each turn is just 1.1 plus 0.9
divided by two, which is one.
So if you start out with $1,
then your expected payout is just $1.
That means you should be willing
to pay anything less than
a dollar to play this game.
Right? Well, if you look at
the distribution of payouts,
you can see that you could win big.
If you tossed a hundred heads,
you'd win 1.1 to the power of a hundred.
That's almost $14,000,
although the chance of that
happening is around 1 in 10
to the power of 30, you'd be more likely
to win the lottery three times in a row.
On the other hand, the median
payout is around 61 cents.
So if you're only
playing the game one time
and you want even odds
of turning a profit,
well then you should
pay less than 61 cents.
Though either way, if you played
the game hundreds of times,
your payout would average out to $1.
Now watch what happens if we
switch the x axis from a linear
scale to a logarithmic scale.
Well then you see the
curve transforms into a
normal distribution.
That's why this type
of distribution is called
a log normal distribution.
- When random effects multiply,
if I have a certain wealth
and then my wealth goes up by
a certain percentage next year
because of my investments,
and then the year
after that it, it changes
by another random factor
as opposed to adding, I'm
multiplying year after year.
If you have a big product
of random numbers,
when you take the log of a product,
that's the sum of the logs.
So if so, what was a product
of random numbers then gets
translated into sums of logs
of random numbers, and that's what leads
to this so-called log normal distribution
and log normal distributions
produce big inequalities.
You don't just see a mean, you see a mean
with a big long tail.
It's much more likelihood of
really big events in this case,
tremendous wealth being obtained
than you would expect from
a normal distribution.
- The reason this curve
is so asymmetric is
because the downside is capped at zero.
So at most you could lose $1,
but the upside can keep
growing up to nearly $14,000.
Now let's go on to table three.
Again, you'll be tossing a coin,
but this time you start out with a dollar
and the payout doubles
each time you toss the coin
and you keep tossing
until you get a heads.
Then the game ends.
So if you get heads on your
first toss, you get $2.
If you get a tails first
and then get a heads on your
second toss, you get $4.
If you flipped two tails
and then a head on your third
toss, you'd get $8 and so on.
If it took you to the Nth toss
to get a heads, you would get 2
to the N dollars.
So how much should you
pay to play this game?
Well, as in our previous example, we need
to work out the expected value.
So suppose you throw
a head on your first try,
the payout is $2
and the probability of
that outcome is a half.
So the expected value of
that toss is a dollar.
If it takes you two tosses to get a heads,
then the payout is $4
and the probability of that
happening is one over four.
So again, the expected value is $1.
We also need to add in the chance
that you flip heads on your third try.
In that case, the payout is $8
and the probability of that
happening is one over eight.
So again, the expected value is $1,
and we have to keep repeating
this calculation over all
possible outcomes.
We have to keep adding $1 for
each of the different options
for flipping the coin, say 10
times until it lands on heads
or a hundred times before you get heads.
I know it's extremely unlikely,
but the payout is so huge
that the expected value of
that outcome is still a dollar.
So it still increases the
expected value of the whole game.
This means that theoretically,
the total expected value
of this game is infinite.
This is known as the
St. Petersburg paradox.
If you look at the
distribution of payouts,
you can see it's uncapped.
It spans across all orders of magnitude.
You could get a payout
of a thousand dollars,
a hundred thousand dollars,
or even a million dollars or more.
And while a million
dollar payout is unlikely,
it's not that unlikely.
It's around one in a million.
Now, if you transform
both axes to a log scale,
you see a straight line with
a gradient of negative one.
The payout of the St. Petersburg paradox 
follows a power law.
The specific power law in this
case is that the probability
of a payout x is equal to x
to the power of negative one
or 1 over x.
In the previous games,
when you have a normal distribution
or even a log normal distribution,
you can measure the width
of that distribution.
It's standard deviation,
and in a normal distribution, 95%
of the data fall within two standard
deviations from the mean.
But with a power law, 
like in the St. Petersburg paradox,
there is no measurable width.
The standard deviation is infinite.
This makes power laws a
fundamentally different beast
with some very weird properties.
- Imagine you take a
bunch of random samples
and then average them
and then take more random
samples and average them.
You'll find that the
average keeps going up,
it doesn't converge,
and the more you measure, the bigger
the average is, which is really weird.
It sounds impossible, but it's
because it has such a heavy
tail, meaning the probability
of really whopping big
events is so significant
that if you keep measuring occasionally,
you're gonna measure one
of those extreme outliers
and they will totally skew the average.
It's sort of like saying, you know,
if you're standing in
a room with Bill Gates
or Elon Musk, the average
wealth in that room
you know is gonna be a hundred
billion dollars or something
because the average is
dominated by one outlier.
- And that same idea,
one outlier can dominate the
average shows up online too.

information of millions of people.

for sponsoring this video.
And now back to power laws.
So why do you get a
power law from the simple
St. Petersburg setup?
If you look at the payout x,
you can see it grows exponentially
with each toss of the coin.
x equals two to the N.
But if you look at the
probability of tossing the coin
that many times to get a heads, you can see
that this probability
shrinks exponentially.
So the probability of flipping
a coin n times is a half
to the power of n, but we're
not really interested in
the number of tosses.
We're interested in the payout.
Now we know that x equals two to the n.
So instead of writing two
to the n in our probability
equation, we can just write x.
So we end up with this.
The probability of a payout
of x dollars is equal
to one over x,
or in other words, x to
the power of negative one.
- You put them together, the exponentials
conspire to make a power law.
And that's a very common
thing in nature, that a lot
of times when we see power laws,
there are two underlying
exponentials that are
dancing together to make a power law.
- One example of this is earthquakes.
If you look at data on
earthquakes, you find
that small earthquakes are very common,
but earthquakes of
increasing magnitudes become
exponentially rarer.
But the destruction that
earthquakes cause is not
proportional to their magnitude.
It's proportional to
the energy they release.
And as earthquakes grow in magnitude,
that energy grows exponentially.
- So there's this exponential
decay in frequency
of earthquakes of a given magnitude
and an exponential increase in
the amount of energy released
by earthquakes of a certain magnitude.
So when you combine those two exponentials
to eliminate the magnitude,
what you find is a power law.
- But power laws also reveal
something deeper about the
underlying structure of a
system to see this in action.
Let's go back to the
third coin game in the
St. Petersburg paradox.
Now you can draw all the
different outcomes as a tree diagram
where the length of each branch
is equal to its probability.
So starting with a
single line of length one
and then a half for the
first two branches, a quarter
for the next four and so on.
Now when you zoom in,
you keep seeing the same
structure repeating at smaller
and smaller scales.
It's self-similar like a fractal,
and that's no coincidence.
We see the same fractal-like
pattern in the veins on a leaf
river networks, the blood vessels in our
lungs, even lightning.
And in all of these cases,
we can describe the pattern
with a power law.
Power laws and fractals
are intrinsically linked.
That's because power laws reveal
something fundamental about
a system structure.
- So I've got a magnet
and I've got a screw,
and you'll notice if I
bring them close together,
then the screw gets attracted
to the magnet, and that's
because there's a lot of iron
 in it, which is ferromagnetic.
But watch what happens if I
start heating this up.
Trying to, oh, you see that?
Ah, there it went. There it went.
You see, you heat it up
and suddenly it becomes non-magnetic.
To find out what happened,
let's zoom in on this magnet.
- Inside a magnet, each atom
has its own magnetic moment,
which means you can think
of it like its own little
magnet or compass.
If one atom's moment points
up, its neighbors tend
to point that way too.
Since this lowers the system's
overall potential energy.
Therefore at low temperatures,
you get large regions called domains
where all the moments align.
And when many of these domains also align,
their individual magnetic
fields reinforce to create an
overall field around the magnet.
But if you heat up the magnet,
each atom starts vibrating vigorously.
The moments flip up and down,
and so the alignment can break down.
And when all the moments cancel out,
then there's no longer
a net magnetic field.
Now, if you have the right equipment,
you can balance any
magnetic material right on
that transition point,
right between magnetic
and non-magnetic.
This is called the critical point,
and it occurs at a
specific temperature called
the curie temperature.
I asked Casper and the
team to build a simulation
to show what's going on
inside the magnet at this critical point,
- Each pixel represents
the magnetic moment
of an individual atom.
Let's say red is up and blue is down.
Now when the temperature is
low, we get these big domains
where the magnetic moments are all aligned
and you get an overall magnetic field.
But if we really crank up
the temperature, then all
of these moments start
flipping up and down
and so they cancel out and the
magnet loses its magnetism.
So that's exactly what
happened in our demo.
But if we tune the temperature
just right, right to
that Curie temperature,
then the pattern becomes
way more interesting.
- This looks like a map,
- Like a map?
- Yeah, it almost looks like
the Mediterranean or something.
It's almost stable, like atoms
that are pointing one way
tend to point that way
for a while,
but there is clearly fluctuations as well.
So domains are constantly
coming and going.
It's both got some elements of stability
and some persistence over time.
Some features which are consistent,
but it's also not locked in place, right?
Because you notice changes over time.
- If you zoom in, you
find that the same kinds
of patterns repeat at all scales.
You've got domains of tens of
atoms, hundreds, thousands,
even millions.
There's just no inherent
scale to the system that is,
it's scale free.
It's just like a fractal.
And if you plot the size
distribution of the domains,
you get a power law.
- The underlying geometry
suddenly shows a fractal character
that it doesn't have on either
side of the phase transition.
Right at the phase transition,
you get fractal behavior
and that pops out as a power law.
- In fact, whenever you find a power law
that indicates you're
dealing with a system
that has no intrinsic scale
and that is a signature of a
system in a critical state,
which turns out has huge consequences.
- See normally in a magnet
below the Curie temperature,
each atom influences only its neighbors.
If one atom's magnetic moment
flips up, then that means
that its neighbors are slightly
more likely to point up too.
But that influence is local,
it dies out just a few atoms away.
But as the magnet approaches
its critical temperature,
those local influences
start to chain together.
One spin notches its neighbor
and that neighbor notches the next
and so on, like a rumor
spreading through a crowd.
And the result is that the effective range
of influence keeps expending.
And right at the critical point,
it becomes effectively infinite.
A flip on one side can
cascade throughout the
entire material.
So you get these small
causes, just a single flip
to reverberate throughout
the entire system.
- And it gets right into
that, that point where
the system is maximally
unstable, anything can happen.
It's also maximally interesting,
in a way it's, it means the
system is most unpredictable,
most uncertain.
It's really hard to know
what's gonna happen next.
And that seems to be a
a, a natural procedure
that happens in many different
systems in the world.
- One such system is forest fires.
In June, 1988,
a lightning strike
started a small fire near
Yellowstone National Park.
This was nothing outta the ordinary.
Each year, Yellowstone
experiences thousands
of lightning strikes.
Most don't cause fires,
and those that do tend
to burn a few trees,
maybe even a few acres
before they fizzle out.
Three quarters of fires burn
less than a quarter of an acre.
The largest fire in the
park's recent history occurred
in 1931.
That burned through 18,000 acres,
an area slightly larger than Manhattan.
But the 1988 fire was different.
That initial spark spread
slowly at first covering
several thousand acres.
Then over the next couple
of months, it merged
with other small fires to
create an enormous complex
of mega fires that blazed
across 1.4 million acres of land
that's around the size of
the entire state of Delaware.
That's 70 times bigger
than the previous record,
and 50 times the area
of all the fires over the
previous 15 years combined.
So what was so special
about the 1988 fires?
Well, to find out, we made
a forest fire simulator.
- We've got a grid of squares,
and on each square, either
a tree could be there,
it could grow, or it could not be there.
There's gonna be some probability
for lightning strikes.
So you know, the higher that probability,
the more fires we're gonna have.
We can run this.
- So trees are growing, trees are growing,
forest is filling in,
nice, getting pretty dense.
- What do you expect is gonna happen?
- I expect to see some fires probably,
you know, now that, oh,
that was good, that
was a good little fire.
Whoa, whoa,
no way.
Well, that's crazy.
You haven't adjusted the
parameters, right? It is just like,
- Not yet. Not yet.
- This seems like a very critical
situation just by itself.
I say that because of
how big that fire was.
- This sort of system will
tune itself to criticality,
and you can, you can
see it start to happen.
So right now, I think it's a good moment
where you have basically domains of a lot
of different sizes.
And then one way to
think about it is, if some
of these domains become too big,
then you get a single fire
like that one perfectly timed,
burns them out, it's just
gonna propagate throughout the
whole thing and burn
it back down a little.
But then if it goes too hard,
then now you've got all these domains
where there are no trees,
and so it's gonna, you know,
grow again to bring it back
to that critical state.
- I can see how it's the
feedback mechanism, right,
that the fire gets rid of all the trees
and there's nothing left to burn,
and then that has to fill in again.
- Yeah
- Yeah.
But if there hasn't been a fire,
then the forest gets too thick
and then it's ripe for
this sort of massive fire.
- For a magnet. You have
to painstakingly tune it
to the critical point,
but the forest naturally
drives itself there.
This phenomenon is called
self-organized criticality.
And if you let it run,
what you get is again
a power law distribution.
So this is log log, so it
should be a straight line.
- That kind of stuff
seems so totally random
and unpredictable, and it is in one way,
and yet it follows a pattern.
There's a consistent mathematical pattern
to all these kind of disasters.
It's, it's shocking.
- Is there something fractal about this?
- Mostly in terms of the, I guess, domains
of the trees when you're
at that critical state.
So you get very dense areas,
you get non dense areas,
and as a result, when a
single lightning bolt strikes,
you can get fires of all sizes.
Most often you get small fires of 10
or fewer trees burning a
little less frequently.
You get fires of less
than a hundred trees.
And then every once in a while
you get these massive fires
that reverberate throughout
the entire system.
Now you might expect that
because the fire is so large, there has
to be a significant event causing it.
But that's not the case
because the cause for each
fire is the exact same.
It's a single lightning strike.
The only difference is where it strikes
and the exact makeup of
the forest at that time.
So in some very real way,
the large fires are
nothing more than magnified
versions of the small ones.
And even worse, they're inevitable.
So what we've learned is that
for systems in a critical state,
there are no special events
causing the massive fires.
There was nothing special
about the Yellowstone fire.
- In 1935, the US Forest Service
established the so-called
10:00 AM policy.
The plan was to suppress every single fire
by 10:00 AM on the day
following its initial report.
Now, naively, this strategy makes sense.
I mean, if you keep all
fires under strict control,
then none can ever get out of hand.
But it turns out this
strategy is extremely risky.
- So let's say we're gonna
bring down the lightning
probability, so it's very small,
only one in a million right now.
And we're also gonna crank up, you know,
the tree growth a little bit.
Now, what do you think is gonna happen?
- We're gonna get some big
fires I would imagine, like a lot
of not fire and then some huge fires.
Yeah.
- Yep. 
- Oh boy.
So nowadays the fire service
has a very different approach.
They acknowledge that
some fires are essential
to make the mega fires less likely.
So they let most small fires burn
and only intervene when necessary.
In some cases, they even
intentionally create small fires
to burn through some of the buildup.
Though it could take
years to return the forest
to its natural state after a
century of fire suppression.
But it's more than just
the Earth's forests
that are balanced in this critical state.
Every day the Earth's crust is moving
and rearranging itself.
Stresses build up slowly
as tectonic plates rub against each other.
Most of the time you get
a few rocks crumbling,
the ground might move just
a fraction of a millimeter,
but the stresses dissipate
in many earthquakes
that you wouldn't even feel.
- There are really tiny earthquakes
that are happening right now between be
beneath your feet, you
just can't feel 'em.
'cause they're very small,
but they are earthquakes.
They're driven by small slipping
movements in the Earth's crust.
- But sometimes those random
movements can trigger a
powerful chain reaction.
- In Kobe Japan, the morning
of January 17th, 1995
seemed just like any other,
this was a peaceful city.
And although Japan as a
country is no stranger
to earthquakes, Kobe
hadn't suffered a major
quake for centuries.
Generations grew up believing the ground
beneath them was stable.
But that morning, deep underground,
a stress released nearby
the Nojima fault line.
The stress propagated to the
next section of the fault.
And the next, within seconds,
the ruptured cascaded along
40 kilometers of crust,
shifting the ground by up to two meters
and releasing the energy equivalent
of numerous atomic bombs.
The resulting quake destroyed
thousands of homes along
with most major roads and
railways leading into the city.
It killed over 6,000 people
and forced 300,000 from their homes.
- How far it goes depends a lot on chance
and the organization of all
that stress field in the Earth's crust.
And it just seems to be
organized in such a way
that it is possible
oftentimes for the earthquake
to trickle along an
avalanche along a long way
and produce a very large
unusual earthquake.
But if you look at the process
behind that earthquake,
it is exactly the same physical process.
It's just that the earthquake
generating process naturally
produces events that range over
an enormous range of scale.
And we're not really used
to thinking about that.
- We have this ingrained
assumption that we can use the past
to predict the future, but
when it comes to earthquakes
or any system that's in a critical state,
that assumption can be catastrophic
because they're famously unpredictable.
So how can you even begin
to model something like the
behavior of earthquakes?
- In 1987, Danish physicist Per Bak
and his colleagues considered
a simple thought experiment,
take a grain of sand
and drop it on a grid, then
keep dropping grains on top
until at some point the
sand pile gets so steep
that the grains tumble down
onto different squares.
- What they looked at
was the size of these,
what they were calling
avalanches, these reorganizations
of numbers of grains of sand.
They asked for how often
do you see avalanches
of a certain size?
- This is the most simple version
of a sand pile simulator that
you could almost imagine.
We're gonna drop a little
grain of sand, at first
always in the center,
and then it's just gonna
keep going up for one grain,
it'll be fine for two grains,
it'll be fine, three grains,
it'll be fine, but it's
on the edge of toppling.
And then when it reaches four
or more, it's gonna basically
go, it feels a bit like a,
I don't know, pulsing thing,
like something's trying
to escape or something
very video game-like
that seemed pretty crazy
and it is symmetrical.
- Yeah, nice geometric features.
- So this might be interesting
because right now we paused it at a point
where this middle one is gonna go
and then you look around it
and you see essentially
you can think of these
brown or you know, these
three tall grain stacks
as being maximally unstable.
They're about to go.
And so you could think
of them as these fingers
of instability, if anything touches them.
The whole system, like they're,
they're just gonna go,
- I see it propagating out,
- It's cool seeing it slower.
I feel like you can see several waves
propagating at the same time.
- Some people have reasoned
that the earth's crust becomes
riddled with similar
fingers of instability
where you get stresses building up
and then when one rock crumbles,
it can propagate along these
fingers potentially triggering
massive earthquakes.
If you look at the data,
there's some even more compelling evidence
that links the sand pile
simulation to earthquakes.
- Let's say instead of
dropping it at the center,
pretty unrealistic to
have a drop in the center.
I'm gonna drop at random.
- Huh. That is crazy.
You can actually see it tune 
itself to the critical state.
Like at the start, you only see
these super tiny avalanches.
- Yeah.
- And then now it's everything.
- It has to build up.
- We can slow down a little.
Oh, and that's a super clean power law.
There are events of all sizes.
One grain of sand might
knock over just a few others,
or it could trigger an
avalanche of millions of grains
that cascade throughout the entire system.
And if you look at the power
law you get from the sand pile
simulation, it closely
resembles the power law
of the energy released
by real earthquakes.
But if you look at the sand pile
experiment more closely,
it doesn't just resemble earthquakes.
What does it remind you of?
- Forest fires.
- Right?!
Feels like it's the exact same behavior.
- That's the really surprising thing.
And that's why this little paper
with a sand pile was published
in the world's top journal
because it did something
that people just didn't
really think was was possible.
- Now, what's ironic is if
you look at real sand piles,
they don't behave like this.
- Okay, you said sand,
I'm gonna do an experiment
on a real sand pile.
And of course it doesn't
follow a power law distribution
of avalanches at all.
It's totally wrong.
Per Bak naturally gets a
chance to reply to the criticism.
And he says, I'm pretty close to quoting.
He says, self-organized
criticality only applies
to the systems it applies to.
So he doesn't care the, the fact
that his theory is not
relevant to real sand piles.
So what? Get out of my face.
He's interested in bigger
fish to fry than, than,
you know, sand piles.
It's like you're taking me too, literally.
I'm talking about a universal mechanism
for generating power laws.
And the fact that it doesn't depend,
it doesn't work in real sand
is uninteresting to him.
I thought that took some real nerve.
- You could think about the earth
and the earth going around the sun.
That's a very complex system.
You've got all the, you've
got the molten core,
everything sloshing around,
and you've got oceans
and you've even got the
moon going around the earth,
which in theory, you know,
all should affect the exact motion
of the earth around the sun.
But Newton ignored all of that.
All he looked at was
just a single parameter,
essentially the mass of the earth.
And with that, he could
correctly, for the most part,
predict how the earth was
gonna go around the sun.
Similarly here, there are people
that have looked at
these phenomena that go
to the critical state in this,
in this case it's self-organized
criticality as it brings itself there.
And what they find is that
there's this universal behavior
where it doesn't even really
matter what the sub parts are,
you just get the behavior
that's the exact same
- At that critical point when,
when all the forces are poised
and the system is right
on that delicate balance
between being organized, highly organized,
or being totally disorganized,
it turns out that almost none
of the physical details about
that system matter to how it behaves.
There's just a universal
behavior that is irrespective of
what physical system you're talking about.
The term that was used
is called universality.
And it's kind of a miracle.
It means you can make extremely
powerful theories without
involving any technical details,
any real details of the material.
- What this means is that
you could have these systems
that on the surface
seem totally different,
but when you get to the critical point,
they all behave in the exact same way.
The other thing you could do
is instead of this being trees,
you could imagine it being people.
And the thing that's spreading...
- Is disease.
- Is disease, yeah.
- You almost get something
for nothing at these,
at these critical points.
- See, many of these
systems fall into what's known
as universality classes.
Some of them you need to tune
to get there like magnets
at their Curie temperature
or fluids like water
or carbon dioxide at
their critical points.
But some other systems
seem to organize themselves
to criticality like the
forest fires or sand piles
or earthquakes.
But what's crazy is
that if you succeed in
understanding just one system from a
class, then you know
how all the systems in
that class behave.
And that includes even the
crudest simplest toy models like
the simulations we've looked at.
So you can model
incredibly complex systems
with the most basic of models.
And some people think
this critical thinking
applies even further.
When we look around the world,
there are lots of systems
that show the same power law behavior
that we see in this critical systems.
It's in everything from DNA
sequencing to the distribution
of species in an ecosystem to the size
of mass extinctions throughout history.
We even see the same behavior
in human systems like the
populations of cities
fluctuations in stock prices,
citations of scientific papers,
and even the number of deaths in wars.
So some people argue that these systems
and perhaps many parts of our
world also organize themselves
to this critical point.
- So the fact that all
these natural hazards,
as they call them, floods, wildfires,
and earthquakes, they all
follow power law distributions
means that these extreme events are
much more common than you
would think based on normal
distribution thinking.
- If you find yourself in a situation
or an environment that is sort
of governed by a power law,
how how should you change her behavior?
- If you have events with one
of these power distributions,
what you're seeing most of
the time is small events.
And this can lull you into
a false sense of security.
You think you understand
how things are going.
You know, floods for
example, there are a lot
of small floods, and then every once in a
while there's a huge one.
One response to this is insurance.
That insurance is designed precisely
to protect you against the
large rare events that would
otherwise be very bad.
But then there's the other
side of that picture,
which is you are the
insurance company that needs
to insure people and they have
a particularly difficult job
because they have to be able
to say how much to charge so
that they have enough money
to pay out when the big
bad thing comes along.
- In 2018, a forest fire tore
through Paradise California.
It became the deadliest
and most destructive fire
in the state's history.
But the insurance company, Merced Property
and Casualty hadn't planned
for something that huge
and when the claims came in,
they just didn't have
the reserves to pay out.
So just like that, the company went bust.
- But while extreme events
can cripple some companies,
there are entire industries
that are built on power law distributions.
Between 1985
and 2014, private equity firm,
Horsley Bridge invested in
7,000 different startups
and over half of their
investments actually lost money.
But the top 6% more than 10x in value
and generated 60% of the
firm's overall profit.
In fact, the best venture
capital firms often have more
investments that lose money.
They just have a few crazy outliers
that show extraordinary growth.
A few outliers that carry
the entire performance.
In 2012, Y Combinator calculated at 75%
of their returns came from just two out
of the 280 startups they invested in.
So venture capital is a world
that depends on taking risks in the hope
that you'll get a few of
these extreme outliers which
outperform all of the rest
of the investments combined.
- Book publishers operate
in a similar fashion,
most titles flop,
but in 1997,
a small independent UK publisher
called Bloomsbury took a
chance on a story about a boy wizard.
The boy's name of course was Harry Potter.
And now Bloomsbury is a
globally recognized brand.
We see a similar pattern
play out on streaming platforms.
On Netflix,
the top 6% of shows account for over half
of all viewing hours on
the platform.
On YouTube, less than 4% of videos
ever reach 10,000 views,
but those videos account
for over 93% of all views.
- All these domains
follow the same principle
that Pareto identified over 100
years ago, where the majority
of the wealth goes to the richest few.
The entire game is defined
by the rare runaway hits.
- But not every industry
can play this game.
Like if you're running
a restaurant, you need
to fill tables night after night.
You can't have one particularly
busy summer evening
that brings in millions of
customers to make up for a bunch
of quiet nights.
Over a year the busy nights 
and quiet ones balance out
and you're left with the
average.
Airlines are similar,
an airline needs to fill
seats on each flight.
You can't squeeze a million
passengers onto one plane.
So it's the average number
of passengers over the year
that defines an airline success.
- We're used to living in this world
of normal distributions.
And you act a certain way.
- Yeah
- But as soon as you switch to this realm
that is governed by a power law, you need
to start acting vastly different.
It really pays to know
what kind of world you're
or what kind of game you're playing.
- That is good. That's good. Yes.
You should come on camera
and just say that just like that.
You were on camera,
you just did do it.
- If you are in a world where
random additive variations can
slow out over time, then you
get a normal distribution.
And in this case, it's
the average performance.
So consistency, which is important.
But if you are in a world
that's governed by a power law
where your returns can multiply
and they can grow over
many orders of magnitude,
then it might make sense
to take some riskier
bets in the hope that one
of them pays off huge.
In other words, it becomes more important
to be persistent than consistent.
- Though as we saw in
the second coin game,
totally random multiplicative
returns give you a logged
normal distribution, not a power law.
To get a power law,
there must be some other
mechanism at play.
In the early two thousands,
Albert-László Barabási was
studying the internet,
and to his surprise, he found
that there was no normal
webpage with some average number of links.
Instead, the distribution
followed a power law.
A few sites like Yahoo had thousands
of times more connections
than most of the others.
Barabási wondered
what could be causing this
power law of the internet.
So he made a simple prediction.
As new sites were added to the internet,
they were more likely to
link to well-known pages.
To test this prediction, he
and his colleague Réka
Albert ran a simulation.
They started with a network
of just a few nodes,
and gradually they added
new nodes to the network
with each new node more likely to connect
to those with the most links.
As the network grew, a power law emerged.
The power was around negative two,
which almost exactly matched
the real data of the internet.
- Look at that. It's still so satisfying.
- That's fun.
This will basically also
distribute a power law.
One of the ideas here is that, you know,
this could be individuals
or even companies.
And so if you're more likely
to become more successful
or more well known to, well more known
or successful, you already
are, you're gonna get this sort
of runaway effect where
you're, you get a few that sort
of dominate, you know, the distributions.
I wonder if part of the takeaway
is like if you're playing
some sort of game that is
dominated by power law,
then you better do the work as much of it
as early as possible.
So you get to benefit from the
snowball effect, essentially.
- Yeah, I guess. I guess
that's, that's a good idea.
I'm not sure whether you
can control it though.
Human beings like to think of ourselves
as being a bit special
and that maybe somehow
because we're intelligent
and have free will, we will escape
the provenance of the laws of
of physics in order and organization.
But I think that's
probably not not the case.
So if you look at, at
the number of world wars,
and if you make a crude measure
of how big is the world war
by how many people it kills,
which is a bit macabre,
but still you find that,
again, it follows a power law
virtually identical to
the power law you find in
stock market crashes.
- So if the world is shaped by power laws,
then it feels like we're
poised in this kind
of critical state where two
identical grains of sand,
two identical actions can
have wildly different effects.
Most things barely move the needle,
but a few rare events
totally dwarf the rest.
And that I think is the
most important lesson.
If you choose to pursue areas governed
by the normal distribution,
you can pretty much
guarantee average results.
But if you select pursuits
ruled by power laws,
the goal isn't to avoid risk, it's
to make repeated intelligent bets.
Most of them will fail,
but you only need one wild
success to pay for all the rest.
- And the thing is that beforehand
you cannot know which bed
it's going to be because the system is
maximally unpredictable.
It could be that your
next bet does nothing.
It could do a little bit
or it could change your entire life.
In fact, around three years ago,
I was reading this little book,
and in the book there was this
little line saying something
like one idea could
transform your entire life.
So right underneath that, I wrote,
send an email to Veritasium.
A couple days later, I wrote
an email to Derek saying,
Hey Derek, I'm Casper.
I study physics and I can
help you research videos.
I didn't hear back for four weeks,
so I was getting pretty sad
and just wanted to forget
about it and move on.
But then a couple days later
I got an email back saying,
Hey Casper, we can't do
an internship right now,
but how would you like to research, write
and produce a video as a freelancer?
So I did, and that's how I
got started at Veritasium.
Hey, just a few quick final things.
All the simulations
that we used in this video
we'll make available for free
for you to use in the
link in the description.
And the other thing is
that we just launched the
official Veritasium game.
It's called Elements of Truth,
and it's a tabletop game
with over 800 questions.
It's the perfect way to
challenge your friends
and see who comes out on top.
Now at Veritasium, we're
all quite competitive,
so every time we play things
get a little bit heated,
but that's honestly a big part of the fun.
Now, when we launched on
Kickstarter, we got a lot
of questions asking if we could
ship to specific countries.
And originally we didn't enable this,
and this is our mistake.
This is on us and we totally hear you.
But I'm glad to say that
right now we have enabled
worldwide shipping.
So no matter where you are in the world,
you can get your very own
copy.
