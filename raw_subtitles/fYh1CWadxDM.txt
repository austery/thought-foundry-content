you
 know
 when
 we
 organized
 this
 this


event
 we
 we
 just
 wanted
 to
 be
 the
 answer


look
 look
 at
 the
 most
 important


questions
 that
 we
 are
 facing
 at
 that


time
 and
 this
 was
 5
 months
 ago
 and
 we


thought
 some
 of
 it
 might
 be
 AI
 but
 it
 it


turned
 out
 to
 be
 AI
 is
 is
 everywhere
 so


I'm
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 beat
 around
 the


bush
 the
 two
 of
 you
 are
 very
 similar
 in


many
 ways
 you
 have


not
 like
 that


you've
 you
 you've
 run
 or
 are
 running


large
 organizations.
 You
 you're
 building


brands
 that
 developers
 love
 and
 and
 use


and
 and
 are
 engaged
 with.
 Thomas,
 you're


now
 starting
 something
 completely
 new.


So,
 you're
 also
 doing
 something


completely
 different.
 What
 is
 an
 AI


first
 or
 AI
 native
 team
 mean
 to
 you?
 And


I'll
 start
 with
 you
 Rajie.


>> Sure.
 F
 first
 of
 all,
 Gerge,
 thank
 you


for
 inviting
 me
 and
 uh
 thanks
 everyone


for
 coming.
 It's
 the
 energy
 here
 is
 just


palpable.
 So
 like
 it's
 really
 great
 to


be
 here
 and
 um
 I'm
 I'm
 really
 excited
 to


be
 talking
 about,
 you
 know,
 AI
 native


stuff.
 Everyone
 wants
 to
 talk
 about
 AI


these
 days.
 So
 it's
 fun.
 Um
 but
 what


does
 an
 AI
 native
 team
 look
 like?
 Um


well,
 first
 of
 all,
 you
 know,
 it
 starts


with
 the
 mindset,
 right?
 You
 have
 to


sort
 of
 really
 believe
 in
 uh
 doing
 AI


native
 work
 and
 working
 with
 agents
 and


things
 like
 that.
 We
 have
 teams
 at


Atlassian
 engineering
 teams,
 some
 of


which
 are
 still
 doing
 the
 more


traditional
 way
 of
 of
 coding
 and


building
 software
 because
 we
 do
 have


legacy
 systems
 that
 take
 that.
 But
 we


have
 a
 number
 of
 AI
 native
 teams
 where


engineers
 are
 basically
 writing
 zero


lines
 of
 code.
 It's
 all
 agents.
 It's


orchestration
 of
 agents.
 Um
 what
 we
 are


finding
 is
 the
 lines
 are
 blurring


between
 PM
 design
 and
 engineering
 where


uh
 PMs
 are
 writing
 code,
 designers
 are


writing
 code.
 This
 is
 basically
 leading


to
 more
 productivity
 generally
 speaking.


And
 u
 the
 thing
 I
 find
 is
 that
 the
 teams


are
 not
 necessarily
 getting
 smaller
 but


they
 are
 producing
 a
 lot
 more
 sometimes


2x
 5x
 more
 and
 uh
 the
 creativity
 is


going
 up.
 What
 you
 build
 is
 is
 much
 more


creative.
 You
 can
 put
 in
 like


screenshots
 of
 things
 and
 design
 you


know
 more
 modern
 UX
 um
 and
 and
 then
 you


can
 also
 between
 PMs
 designs
 and


engineers
 the
 the
 distance
 is
 shrinking


as
 well.
 So
 that's
 making
 for
 more
 uh


vigorous
 conversation
 and
 more


creativity.
 I
 find
 that
 the
 discussion


about
 using
 AI
 to
 produce
 more


efficiency
 and
 maybe
 smaller
 teams
 and


fewer
 engineers
 is
 missing
 the
 point.


It's
 more
 about
 what
 can
 you
 create
 now


with
 AI
 that
 you
 could
 not
 create
 before


and
 how
 can
 you
 be
 that
 much
 more


productive
 and
 how
 can
 you
 have
 that


much
 more
 joy.


You
 know,
 I
 think
 there's
 multiple


answers
 to
 this.
 Rajie
 gave
 one
 of
 them.


If
 I
 think
 about
 the
 word
 AI
 native
 in


the
 same
 context
 as
 cloud
 native,
 um


when
 GitHub
 started
 in
 2008,
 nobody


spoke
 about
 cloud
 native.
 It
 is
 a
 term


that
 was
 introduced
 after
 the
 fact
 after


in
 identifying
 how
 all
 these
 companies


reinvented
 how
 they're
 deploying
 and
 and


and
 developing
 systems.
 And
 I
 think
 the


same
 is
 going
 to
 be
 true
 for
 AI
 native.


What
 we're
 calling
 AI
 native
 now
 is


going
 to
 be
 very
 different
 than
 uh
 what


is
 going
 to
 be
 AI
 native
 in
 a
 few
 years.


And
 I
 have
 two
 two
 boys
 13
 and
 11
 and


most
 of
 the
 time
 they're
 playing


Minecraft.
 Sometimes
 I
 can
 also
 convince


them
 to
 code
 but
 certainly
 they
 are
 AI


native.
 You
 know,
 one
 day
 they
 came


home,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a
 year
 or
 two
 ago,


and
 they
 showed
 me
 their
 cell
 phones
 and


they
 had
 like
 puppy
 images
 on
 the
 on
 the


front
 p
 on
 the
 home
 screen
 and
 they
 use


Adobe
 Firefly
 to
 generate
 these
 images.


And
 I'm
 like,
 how
 the
 hell
 did
 you
 find


Adobe
 Firefly?
 Oh,
 everybody
 in
 school


is
 using
 it.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 AI


native
 generation,
 those
 that
 are


growing
 up
 now
 with
 these
 agents.
 For


them,
 it
 will
 be
 just
 so
 natural
 to
 use


an
 agent
 instead
 of
 going
 to,
 you
 know,


a
 Google
 search
 or
 I
 mean
 trying
 to
 find


it
 to
 do
 the
 the
 traditional
 way.
 And
 I


think
 if
 we're
 all
 honest
 to
 ourselves,


you
 know,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 sorry


 out
 there
 of
 how
 all
 dayto-day


is
 a
 native
 and
 I'm
 using
 agents
 for


everything.
 You
 know,
 I'm
 a
 startup


founder.
 Most
 of
 the
 time
 I'm
 still


dealing
 with
 HR
 systems
 and
 my
 my
 month


and
 close
 and
 getting,
 you
 know,
 uh,


directors
 of
 board
 insurance
 and
 that's


a
 form
 that
 I
 have
 to
 fill
 out.
 No
 agent


helps
 me
 with
 any
 of
 that.
 And
 if
 you


hear
 that
 in
 podcast,
 I'm
 like,
 "Sure,


sure,
 sure."
 You
 know,
 like
 in
 theory


that
 is
 my
 life.
 But
 in
 reality,
 h
 you


know,
 yesterday
 we
 announced
 uh
 my
 my


company.
 Since
 then,
 I
 got
 like
 hundreds


of
 emails
 from
 investors
 that
 want
 to


absolutely
 still
 angel
 invest
 into
 the


seat
 round.
 People
 that
 have
 12
 years
 of


experience
 are
 the
 best
 developers,
 you


know,
 on
 the
 planet,
 yet
 they're
 sending


me
 an
 email
 to
 to
 apply
 for
 a
 job.
 And


and
 I'm
 I'm
 looking
 for
 the
 agent
 that


solves
 all
 that
 for
 me
 instead
 of
 just


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 can
 I
 be
 both


nice
 human
 to
 give
 them
 response,
 but


also
 let
 them
 know
 that
 I'm
 not


interested
 in,
 you
 know,
 that


conversation
 right
 now
 because
 I
 want
 to


build
 a
 company.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 the


like
 the
 the
 c qu crux
 of
 AI
 native


teams
 today
 in
 a
 software
 development.


Yes,
 we're
 going
 to
 use
 cloud
 code
 or
 or


some
 agent
 to
 build
 code,
 but
 no,
 we're


not
 going
 to
 feed
 Markdown
 files
 into


that.
 Like
 3,000
 software
 engineers
 all


collaborating
 on
 markdown,
 that
 is
 a


nightmare,
 right?
 Um
 if
 you
 have
 then


folks
 in
 Germany,
 you
 know,
 that
 speak


English
 with
 an
 accent
 or
 in
 Spain
 or
 in


India
 and
 China
 and
 whatnot
 that
 don't


actually
 are
 as
 fluent
 in
 English,
 it's


actually
 an
 even
 worse
 nightmare
 because


programming
 language
 is
 great.
 It


reduces
 vocabulary
 on
 like
 20
 words
 that


everybody
 can
 speak.
 As
 soon
 as
 you
 have


to
 describe
 a
 feature
 in
 a
 language
 that


you
 don't
 actually
 think
 in,
 it's
 really


really
 hard.
 And
 I
 think
 we
 haven't


figured
 any
 of
 that
 out.


>> And
 how
 are
 your
 teams
 today
 using


tools?
 How
 have
 their
 workflows
 changed?


>> I
 think
 the
 biggest
 change
 in
 the


workflow
 is
 that
 um
 you
 basically
 most


uh
 uh
 developers
 that
 start
 Greenfield


from
 scratch
 today
 and
 and
 have
 used


cloud
 code
 is
 that
 they
 force
 themselves


to
 not
 look
 at
 the
 code.
 uh
 and
 that


basically
 it
 starts
 with


>> that
 that's
 happening
 at
 your
 teams


right


>> that's
 happening
 I
 think
 that's


happening
 everywhere
 in
 the
 industry


like
 in
 all
 the
 people
 I'm
 interviewing


uh
 whether
 they
 work
 at
 Microsoft
 GitHub


or
 Atlassian
 or
 thought
 works
 or
 or


block
 or
 so


>> easy
 with
 the
 poaching
 there


>> well
 I'm


all
 coming
 to
 me
 you
 know


>> but
 all
 Thomas
 yeah


>> well
 you
 know
 um
 you
 a
 third
 about
 a


third
 of
 the
 our
 team
 of
 my
 startup


entire
 is
 Australian
 because
 one
 of
 the


co-founders
 um
 is
 actually
 um
 went
 to


high
 school
 with
 me
 in
 East
 Berlin
 and


then
 immigrated
 to
 Australia.
 Um
 and
 so


the
 Australian
 press
 didn't
 uh
 um
 um
 let


that
 uh
 opportunity
 go
 to
 a
 little


bit
 on
 Atlassian
 yesterday
 when
 the


announcement
 came
 uh
 because
 your
 stock


price
 is
 down
 and
 whatnot
 has
 nothing
 to


do
 with
 us.
 But
 of
 course,
 you
 know,


that's
 not
 how
 the
 press
 works.
 Um


>> it's
 all
 the
 sad
 stuff,
 you
 know.


>> Yeah.
 H
 anyway,
 um
 where
 was
 I?
 um


developers,
 you
 know,
 that
 want
 to
 be
 AI


native,
 what
 they're
 doing
 is
 try
 to


look
 at
 little
 as
 code
 as
 pos
 at
 the


code
 as
 possible
 and
 force
 yourselves
 to


figure
 it
 out
 with
 a
 prompt
 and
 a


reasoning
 process
 and
 and
 voicing


intent,
 right?
 And
 then
 same
 way
 with


code
 review
 ideally,
 you
 know,
 I
 never


read
 the
 code
 line
 by
 line
 because


that's
 going
 to
 become
 increasing


bottleneck.
 I
 have
 like
 cursor
 buckbot


or
 or
 one
 of
 these
 tools
 point
 out
 the


mistakes
 to
 me
 and
 I'm
 waiting
 for
 the


moment
 and
 I
 think
 uh
 uh
 a
 previous


session
 alluded
 to
 this
 that
 let's
 just


have
 the
 code
 review
 bot
 or
 agent
 work


with
 the
 coding
 agent.
 Why
 would
 you


need
 the
 human
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 that?


And
 I
 think
 that's
 where
 that
 the
 what


the
 the
 most
 AI
 native
 developers
 are


right
 now
 is
 the
 ones
 that
 uh
 have


figured
 out
 how
 to
 do
 that
 and
 that
 is
 a


skill
 in
 itself
 and
 that's
 I
 think


answering
 the
 question
 are
 we
 going
 to


replace
 humans
 with
 agents?
 No,
 we
 are


upleveling
 the
 humans
 to
 become
 the
 the


masters
 of
 these
 of
 these
 agents.
 Yeah.


And
 on
 tools
 I
 think
 like
 the
 there's


two
 parts
 to
 it
 right.
 is
 that
 coding


and
 implementation
 is
 becoming
 free
 to


the
 point
 where
 the
 bottleneck
 is


shifting
 to
 what
 I
 call
 the
 left
 of
 code


and
 the
 right
 of
 code
 on
 the
 left
 of


code
 it's
 about
 planning
 and
 specking


and
 there
 increasingly
 one
 of
 the
 tools


we
 are
 using
 in
 a
 classion
 a
 lot
 is


confluence
 because
 confluence
 is
 where


the
 intent
 and
 the
 spec
 and
 yes
 it's


mostly
 English
 language
 and
 Thomas
 makes


a
 good
 point
 about
 language
 but
 um


that's
 where
 you
 are
 putting
 in
 really


what
 you
 want
 to
 build
 uh
 especially
 for


product
 oriented
 engineers
 they're
 going


in
 and
 putting
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 comments
 and


our
 agents
 are
 able
 to
 read
 the
 comments


and
 go
 off
 in
 a
 Ralph
 loop
 and
 you
 know


solve
 things
 which
 is
 really
 amazing.
 uh


but
 yeah
 left
 of
 code
 and
 then
 right
 of


code
 it's
 the
 standard
 stuff
 CI/CD


deployment
 incidents
 sees
 how
 do
 you


find
 that
 out
 so
 using
 agents
 to
 do
 that


is
 is
 what
 we're
 doing
 so
 I'd
 say
 we
 are


looking
 at
 it
 holistically
 across
 the


entire
 software
 development
 life
 cycle


we
 call
 it
 the
 AI
 native
 SDLC
 all
 the


way
 from
 ideation
 to
 coding
 to
 like


deployment
 in
 production
 we
 we
 are


changing
 the
 tool
 set
 quite
 a
 bit


>> okay
 what
 about
 rooev
 tell
 me
 what


roboev
 is


>> yeah
 yeah yeah
 so
 roboev
 is
 a
 coding


agent
 but
 it's
 also
 our
 brand
 for
 like


doing
 uh
 things
 across
 the
 entire
 SDLC.


So
 we
 using
 it
 for
 code
 reviews,
 we're


using
 it
 for
 CI/CD,
 we
 are
 using
 it
 for


uh
 incident
 resolution.


>> So
 you
 built
 your
 own
 coding
 agent.


>> Yes.
 Uh
 now
 here
 interesting
 thing
 is
 we


are
 using
 anthropics
 model.
 Uh
 but
 in


the
 benchmark
 we
 actually
 beat
 plot


code.
 Uh
 which
 is
 sounds
 amazing.
 How


does
 how
 do
 you
 do
 that
 using
 their


model?
 Well,
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 one
 magic


word
 which
 is
 context.
 Um
 agents
 are
 as


smart
 as
 the
 context
 you
 give.
 And
 in


Atlassian
 we
 have
 built
 what
 is
 called


the
 teamwork
 graph
 which
 is
 you
 know
 who


does
 Thomas
 work
 with
 on
 which
 um
 PR
 on


which
 issue
 in
 Jira
 and
 that
 context


really
 helps
 uh
 rob
 do
 a
 much
 better
 job


with
 the
 PR
 it
 produces


what
 is
 happening
 with
 distributed
 teams


Thomas
 you
 mentioned
 that
 your
 team
 is


spread
 across
 a
 bunch
 of
 different
 time


zones
 which
 is
 super
 unusual
 for
 a
 early


stage
 startup
 usually
 the
 conventional


wisdom
 is
 like
 be
 in
 the
 same
 office


you're
 going
 to
 be
 riffing
 at
 the
 each


Why
 did
 you
 decide
 to
 go
 distributed
 and


does
 AI
 have
 to
 do
 anything
 with
 this?


>> First
 of
 all,
 I
 want
 to
 say,
 you
 know,
 I


I'm
 a
 strong
 believer
 of
 everybody
 needs


to
 find
 their
 own
 happiness,
 right?
 And


there's
 just
 similar
 to
 the
 relationship


that
 you
 have
 in
 your
 personal
 life,


it's
 same
 with
 the
 relationship
 you
 have


with
 your
 company.
 There
 is
 not
 one


perfect
 approach.
 And
 if
 you
 want
 to


work
 in
 a
 company
 that
 has
 a
 beautiful


office
 in
 San
 Francisco,
 great.
 You
 want


to
 work
 in
 a
 hybrid
 scenario,
 also


great.
 And
 I
 love
 working
 in
 remote


teams
 because
 I
 love
 traveling.
 Uh
 I


love
 the
 247
 coverage
 if
 you
 have
 people


in
 Australia,
 in
 Germany,
 in
 Spain,
 uh


in
 Lisbon
 and
 uh
 UK,
 whatever
 in
 in
 in


United
 States
 in
 the
 different
 time


zones.
 And
 that
 makes
 my
 life
 happy
 and


doesn't
 mean
 that
 anybody
 else
 is
 wrong


in
 in
 how
 they're
 running
 the
 company.


Um
 what
 it
 does
 though
 is
 if
 you
 have
 a


remote
 team
 is
 that
 you're
 lonely,


right?
 And
 lonely
 in
 might
 be
 in
 the


kind
 of
 like
 co
 alone
 at
 home
 sense,
 but


also
 in
 the
 who
 is
 available
 for
 me
 to


ask
 the
 question.
 And
 it's
 much
 easier


to
 do
 that
 in
 an
 office
 environment


because
 you
 can
 kind
 of
 figure
 out
 well


Gerley
 is
 only
 you
 know
 surfing
 on
 X
 and


and
 and
 posting
 and
 whatnot
 and
 uh
 so
 I


can
 ask
 him
 a
 question
 and
 um
 never


never
 and
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 in
 the
 same


time
 if
 you're
 busy
 in
 a
 conversation


with
 Rajie
 then
 obviously
 I
 won't
 run


into
 the
 conference
 room
 and
 ask
 you
 hey


can
 you
 do
 this
 code
 review
 for
 me
 and
 I


think
 agents
 basically
 gave
 us
 these


bearings
 partners
 these
 e
 experts
 that
 I


can
 just
 ask
 and
 say
 hey
 I
 want
 to


brainstorm
 on
 this
 topic
 I
 need
 to
 write


an
 ADR
 or
 like
 solve
 a
 problem.
 You


know,
 I
 was
 uh
 over
 the
 weekend


preparing
 a
 launch.
 So,
 I
 figured
 out
 I


need
 not
 only
 a
 terms
 of
 service
 and
 a


privacy
 policy,
 I
 also
 need
 a
 cookie


policy.
 So,
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


how
 do
 I
 do
 that
 in
 the
 React
 app
 and
 I


just
 asked
 Cursor
 Composer
 to
 do
 that


for
 me
 and
 it
 was
 done
 in
 3
 seconds,


right?
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 the
 remote


work
 um
 with
 the
 help
 of
 agent
 has


gotten
 a
 new
 level
 that
 wasn't
 possible


before
 because
 I
 have
 always
 somebody


available
 my
 code
 review
 agent
 my
 coding


agent
 know
 my
 brainstorming
 agent
 my


research
 agents
 all
 these
 kind
 of
 things


and
 then
 I
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 for
 us
 the


huge
 benefit
 especially
 if
 you
 have


these
 launch
 days
 right
 if
 you
 everybody


in
 the
 same
 time
 zone
 in
 the
 same
 office


at
 some
 point
 you
 need
 to
 go
 home
 like


that's
 just
 the
 reality
 if
 you
 have


folks
 in
 Australia
 by
 the
 time
 it's
 6


p.m.
 here
 it's
 like
 noon
 or
 something
 in


Melbourne
 and
 so
 they're
 still
 working


and
 maintaining
 you
 know
 the
 engagement


on
 discord
 and
 and
 the
 open
 source


project.
 I
 think
 in
 some
 ways
 you
 know


agents
 have
 gotten
 as
 an
 advantage
 again


you
 know
 for
 being
 remote
 first
 uh
 and


that
 you
 know
 other
 teams
 that
 work
 in


the
 office
 together
 you
 know
 have
 on
 on


their
 side
 when
 when
 they
 can
 brainstorm


in
 front
 of
 whiteboard.
 It
 evened
 out
 a


little
 bit
 of
 the
 competitive


disadvantage
 that
 certainly
 has
 evolved


here
 in
 San
 Francisco
 as
 most
 of
 the
 AI


native
 companies
 have
 gotten
 back
 into


office.


>> And
 Reie,
 how
 are
 you
 seeing
 this
 cuz


you've
 been
 you
 have
 distributed
 teams.


Is
 it
 changing?


>> Yeah.
 Um
 well,
 we
 have
 we
 are
 actually


Atlassian
 has
 been
 uh
 leaning
 into


distributed
 teams
 way
 before
 like
 even


before
 COVID.
 So
 when
 actually
 co


happened
 it
 was
 super
 natural
 for
 us
 to


um
 to
 be
 in
 that
 kind
 of
 situation.
 Our


software
 naturally
 is
 for
 collaboration


across
 distributed
 teams
 that
 we're
 not


remote.
 We
 have
 offices.
 We
 have
 offices


in
 San
 Francisco,
 in
 Sydney,
 in
 in


different
 parts
 of
 the
 world.
 So
 we
 do


believe
 in
 like
 that
 intentional


togetherness
 you
 get
 when
 human
 beings


come
 together
 and
 and
 work
 together.
 So


we're
 not
 like
 a
 remote
 only,
 remote


first
 kind
 of
 company.
 But
 uh
 we
 don't


mandate
 you
 coming
 into
 the
 office.
 We


like
 you
 can
 work
 from
 anywhere.
 We
 call


it
 team
 anywhere.
 You
 can
 work
 from


anywhere.
 You
 can
 work
 with
 people.
 And


to
 Thomas's
 point,
 I
 think
 agents
 have


changed
 things
 a
 lot.
 Like
 I
 remember


the
 days
 when
 I
 was
 in
 the
 office
 at
 2


a.m.
 writing
 code
 and
 you
 get
 stuck
 and


all
 you
 can
 do
 is
 like
 read
 the
 code
 and


read
 the
 code
 more
 until
 you
 understand


it
 and
 figure
 it
 out.
 Uh
 well
 now
 you


can
 ask
 an
 agent
 and
 the
 agent
 can


explain
 it
 for
 you
 or
 even
 better
 do
 the


code
 for
 you.
 So
 I
 think
 with
 agents


it's
 gotten
 even
 better
 and
 easier
 for


us
 to
 be
 able
 to
 be
 distributed
 in
 this


in
 this
 fashion.


And
 you
 know
 like
 a
 big
 thing
 that
 we're


all
 seeing
 you're
 seeing
 it
 as
 well
 the


role
 of
 software
 engineer
 changing
 and


the
 role
 of
 the
 engineing
 leader
 the


engineing
 manager
 changing
 from
 your


vantage
 point
 what
 are
 you
 seeing


happening
 so
 far
 what
 do
 you
 expect
 and


especially
 looking
 at
 at
 last
 are
 are


you
 are
 you
 doing
 any
 change
 in
 in
 terms


of
 like
 defining
 the
 role
 or
 thinking


about
 or
 relaxing
 some
 of
 the
 things


that
 you've
 kind
 of
 had
 had
 in
 place


before?
 Yeah,
 we
 we
 think
 about
 it
 in


terms
 of
 like
 uh
 what
 changes
 with


respect
 to
 ownership,
 accountability,


things
 like
 that,
 right?
 And
 what
 we're


finding
 is
 it's
 less
 about
 code


ownership.
 It's
 more
 about
 like
 now
 the


artifacts
 are
 shifting
 to
 things
 like


Confluence
 and
 Jira
 and
 even
 Loom.
 We


have
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 interaction
 through
 a


product
 we
 acquired
 called
 Loom
 that's


now
 partian
 product
 and
 you
 can
 express


a
 lot
 more
 uh
 intent
 and
 thoughts
 and


video
 and
 so
 feeding
 that
 into
 our
 AI


agents
 and
 using
 that
 to
 produce
 better


artifacts.
 um
 the
 ownership
 is
 shifting


towards
 that
 and
 then
 the
 accountability


part
 is
 increasing
 as
 well
 instead
 of


like
 a
 lot
 of
 code
 reviews
 and
 trying
 to


understand
 whether
 the
 code
 is
 good


which
 you
 still
 have
 to
 do
 but
 the


agents
 help
 you
 it's
 about
 verification


right
 uh
 what
 are
 the
 guardrails
 what


are
 the
 inputs
 and
 outputs
 that
 you
 want


to
 verify
 that
 so
 that
 you
 know
 that
 the


AI
 code
 is
 good
 and
 that
 the
 agents
 have


done
 a
 good
 job
 uh
 that's
 where
 the


ownership
 and
 accountability
 is
 shifting


and
 so
 that's
 that's
 how
 we
 are
 thinking


about
 it
 but
 in
 terms
 of
 team
 structures


and
 managers
 and
 PMs
 and
 designers
 and


engineers
 we
 aren't


thinking
 we're
 not
 doing
 like
 radical


changes
 yet.
 What
 we
 are
 focusing
 on
 is


that
 team
 structure,
 that
 team
 that's


producing
 the
 feature.
 How
 can
 they
 do


more?
 How
 can
 they
 be
 more
 creative?
 Uh


we're
 not
 going
 down
 the
 path
 of
 saying,


"Oh,
 let's
 do
 it,
 you
 know,
 with
 fewer


people
 necessarily."
 That's
 not
 the


biggest
 thing.
 In
 some
 cases,
 we
 do
 find


10x
 even
 100x
 more
 productivity
 and
 we


then
 reshape
 the
 team
 for
 that.
 But
 our


angle
 is
 more
 how
 do
 you
 unleash
 more


creativity
 and
 how
 do
 you
 do
 more?


>> Can
 you
 tell
 me
 a
 tiny
 bit
 more
 when
 you


say
 like
 you
 see
 more
 productivity
 team


and
 you
 reshape
 the
 team
 for
 that?
 What


could
 that
 mean
 or
 what
 does
 that
 mean?


Well,
 we've
 tried
 some
 projects
 where
 uh


we
 are
 like,
 hey,
 what
 if
 we
 didn't


write
 any
 code
 manually?
 Like
 what
 does


that
 look
 like?
 Right?
 And
 uh
 that


forces
 you
 to
 think
 differently.
 That


forces
 you
 to
 organize
 a
 repo


differently.
 That
 forces
 you
 to
 um
 set


up
 the
 rules
 for
 the
 agents
 differently.


The
 agents
 uh
 don't
 have
 enough
 context.


When
 you
 have
 a
 repo
 with
 full
 of
 code,


it
 can
 start
 off
 in
 a
 better
 place.
 And


so
 that
 forces
 you
 to
 sort
 of
 really
 be


AI
 native
 AI
 first.
 And
 we're
 finding


that
 in
 those
 cases,
 we
 make
 a
 lot
 of


progress.
 You
 can
 get
 real
 good


productivity.
 But
 if
 you
 have
 a
 legacy


codebase
 uh
 that
 has
 been
 around
 for
 a


long
 time,
 it's
 not
 as
 easy,
 right?
 We


find
 that,
 you
 know,
 it
 takes
 a
 lot
 more


effort
 and
 things
 like
 that.
 And
 so
 we


have
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 progress
 with
 Robo


Dev,
 but
 it's
 not
 yet
 at
 the
 point
 where


you
 can
 give
 it
 like
 a
 complex
 project


on
 a
 legacy
 codebase.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


a
 hard
 problem
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


working
 on.
 I
 think
 we'll
 get
 there
 very


soon,
 but
 that's
 an
 area
 where
 you
 can't


go
 and
 and
 be
 as
 aggressive.


Yeah.
 I
 have
 two
 angles
 on
 this.
 I
 think


one
 is,
 you
 know,
 we
 we're
 constantly
 in


this
 problem
 that
 we
 have
 way
 too
 many


ideas
 in
 life
 and
 way
 too
 many
 things
 to


do.
 You
 know,
 one
 of
 my
 jokes
 is
 that


when
 you're
 single,
 your
 Saturday


morning
 is
 great.
 You
 have
 all
 the
 plans


for
 the
 weekend.
 When
 you're
 married


with
 kids,
 uh
 all
 the
 plans
 that
 you
 had


on
 Saturday
 morning
 didn't
 happen
 by


Sunday
 night
 because
 your
 family


determined
 what
 you're
 actually
 doing


over
 the
 weekend.
 And
 the
 same
 is
 true


in
 software
 projects.
 And
 the
 way
 we're


solving
 this
 is
 we're
 writing
 things


down
 in
 to-do
 lists
 and
 we're
 moving


them
 into
 linear
 backlogs.
 and
 your


backlog
 gets
 longer
 and
 longer
 and


somebody
 just
 throw
 it
 all
 away
 and


start
 fresh
 and
 bring
 up
 the
 same
 ideas


again.
 And
 what
 we're
 now
 doing
 with


agents,
 we're
 shifting
 this
 one
 step
 to


the
 right
 where
 we
 just
 feed
 all
 of
 that


into
 agents
 and
 agents
 write
 all
 the


code
 and
 now
 you
 have
 your
 backlog
 and


your
 pull
 requests.
 And
 there's
 the


bottleneck
 now
 because
 you
 can't
 review


all
 of
 that.
 Uh,
 and
 then
 are
 going
 to


be
 agents
 that
 review
 all
 that
 code
 and


auto
 merge
 and
 auto
 deploy
 it.
 And
 what


you
 get
 is
 the
 Homer
 Simpsons
 car,


right?
 because
 all
 the
 ideas
 you
 had,


you
 know,
 without
 without
 any
 process


and
 any
 creativity
 and
 and
 and
 product


management
 and
 whatnot
 leads
 to
 products


that
 have
 lots
 of
 features
 that
 look


like
 Homer
 Simpson.
 I
 don't
 everybody


has
 that
 picture
 in
 your
 head.
 The
 the


flip
 side
 of
 that
 is,
 you
 know,
 that
 and


then
 obviously
 we
 need
 to
 so
 that
 we


still
 need
 product
 managers
 and


designers
 and
 engineers
 to
 actually


architect
 products
 that
 are
 really


great.
 And
 um
 every
 time
 you're
 using
 a


product
 that's
 not
 great,
 you
 know,


exactly
 that
 that's
 the
 case,
 right?


Like
 that's
 it's
 easier
 for
 us
 to
 find


something
 bad
 than
 finding
 something


good.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 I
 think
 we're


seeing
 going
 to
 see
 a
 massive
 role


collapse
 um
 between
 the
 traditional


engineering
 roles,
 right?
 Um
 you're
 not


the
 pragmatic
 product
 product
 manager


and
 the
 product
 designer,
 but
 I
 actually


think
 the
 product
 manager
 is
 becoming
 a


product
 engineer
 and
 the
 designer
 is


becoming
 a
 design
 engineer
 and
 the


software
 engineer
 stays
 a
 software


engineer.
 And
 so
 the
 ven
 diagram
 of


these
 roles
 is
 overlapping
 much
 more.


I
 think
 it
 was
 this
 morning's
 session
 or


maybe
 it
 was
 the
 off
 the
 record
 session


yesterday,
 but
 uh
 we're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of


that
 where
 product
 managers
 in
 companies


um
 are
 now
 forced
 to
 as
 an
 as
 an


expectation
 of
 their
 job
 to
 use
 a
 coding


agent
 to
 build
 a
 prototype
 instead
 of


just
 writing
 a
 document
 and
 handing
 it


off.
 Now
 that's
 the
 obvious
 part
 of


this,
 but
 it's
 also
 true
 for
 your


marketer,
 for
 your
 coms
 people,
 for
 your


assistant.
 all
 those
 folks
 are
 already


using
 lovable
 or
 ripple
 it
 or
 any
 of


these
 tools
 to
 actually
 automate
 part
 of


their
 life.
 And
 then
 the
 question


becomes
 is
 it
 the
 bad
 cop
 uh
 like
 in
 the


I
 think
 it
 was
 in
 the
 Phoenix
 project


that
 blocks
 everybody
 from
 deploying
 or


do
 we
 find
 ways
 in
 the
 organizations
 to


actually
 let
 everybody
 be
 a
 builder
 and


and
 contribute
 to
 back
 to
 what


ultimately
 is
 the
 goal
 of
 every


organization
 which
 is
 as
 a
 team
 together


we
 are
 much
 more
 powerful
 than
 as


individuals
 right
 that's
 the
 Dutch


trading
 company
 philosophy
 if
 if
 you
 go


back
 where
 companies
 come
 from
 and
 we


have
 to
 find
 these
 processes
 and
 I
 think


that's
 the
 thing
 that
 we
 haven't
 really


figured
 out
 of
 how
 in
 a
 secure
 way
 and


uh
 trustworthy
 A
 we
 can
 ship
 amazing


products,
 you
 know,
 by
 moving
 much


faster
 through
 the
 life
 cycle
 while
 at


the
 same
 time
 empowering
 everybody
 in


the
 company
 to
 to
 do
 so.


>> And
 we
 we've
 talked
 about
 this
 is
 the


engineer
 role
 and
 of
 course
 like
 how
 the


designers
 and
 and
 product
 managers
 are


getting
 closer.
 What
 about
 the


engineering
 leader?
 You
 know,
 you you've


got
 a
 lot
 of
 outstanding
 engineering


leaders
 inside
 at
 Lash
 and
 how
 do
 you


see
 their
 roles
 changing
 and
 you
 know


Thomas
 like
 as
 you're
 going
 to
 be


hiring,
 who
 would
 you
 hire
 for?
 Like


before
 you
 would
 have
 obviously
 hired


for
 every
 10
 engineers
 like
 an
 engine


manager
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 How
 how


will
 that
 change
 for
 you?
 So
 I'll
 I'll


start
 off
 with
 you
 Rajie.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 one
 of the
 most
 exciting


things
 for
 engineering
 leaders
 including


myself
 is
 we
 can
 write
 more
 code
 now.


Like
 you
 know
 um
 I
 love
 writing
 code.
 I


I
 over
 the
 holidays
 you
 know
 bought
 a


laptop
 and
 you
 know
 because
 sometimes


you
 can't
 install
 things
 because
 of
 it


but
 like
 Iought


I
 bought
 my
 own
 personal
 laptop
 at
 the


Apple
 store
 installed
 cloud
 code
 and
 you


know
 built
 an
 app
 bunch
 of
 Python


scripts
 and
 things
 like
 that.
 Um
 and
 and


you
 know
 for
 someone
 who
 has
 grown
 up


writing
 code
 for
 my
 bar
 for
 my
 own
 code


is
 super
 high
 like
 as
 it
 is
 for
 all
 my


engineers
 and
 so
 like
 for
 me
 to
 take
 a


time
 out
 to
 go
 and
 build
 a
 whole
 new


feature
 it
 it's
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 in


the
 old
 traditional
 way
 but
 now
 I
 can
 do


it
 much
 faster
 with
 robo
 dev
 with
 with


agents
 and
 things
 like
 that
 and
 it's


always
 satisfying
 to
 go
 join
 a
 hackathon


build
 something
 and
 write
 code
 and
 so


for
 all
 the
 leaders
 I
 think
 it's
 like


you
 know
 you
 can
 get
 a
 lot
 more


connected
 because
 sometimes
 as
 a
 leader


you
 go
 up
 the
 chain
 and
 then
 you
 get


more
 disconnected
 from
 code
 and


engineers
 and
 now
 I
 think
 that
 is
 that


gap
 is
 shrinking.
 The
 other
 thing
 that's


interesting
 that's
 happening
 is
 the
 span


of
 control
 is
 changing.
 I've
 always


advocated
 for
 you
 know
 the
 the


degenerate
 case
 of
 where
 you
 have
 a
 team


of
 400
 engineers.
 You
 take
 the
 square


root
 of
 400
 and
 you
 have
 essentially
 20


direct
 reports
 each
 having
 20
 direct


reports
 and
 then
 it's
 just
 two
 layers
 of


management.
 Uh
 but
 usually
 most
 most


organizations
 have
 people
 who
 have
 like


five
 or
 three
 reports
 that
 most


degenerate
 cases
 the
 binary
 tree
 right


two
 reports
 two
 reports
 two
 reports
 all


the
 way
 down.
 Um
 but
 I
 think
 the
 span
 of


controls
 will
 increase.
 I
 think
 you
 know


Tibo
 I
 think
 talked
 about
 having
 33


direct
 reports.
 You
 know
 Jensen
 talks


about


>> 33.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Having
 like
 40
 or
 50.
 Yeah.


I
 think
 like
 people
 will
 have
 more


direct
 reports
 and
 fewer
 managers
 and


managers
 will
 be
 more
 connected
 with
 the


quotes.
 I
 think
 all
 of
 this
 is
 really
 a


good
 thing.


>> As
 a
 followup,
 what
 about
 the


traditional
 career
 path?
 traditional
 oh


my
 gosh
 I'm
 talking
 like
 you
 know
 like


pre
 like
 2020
 2022
 because
 we
 were
 used


to
 there
 was
 a
 career
 path
 like
 be
 a
 you


know
 software
 engineer
 senior
 engineer


then
 either
 staff
 engineer
 engine


manager
 senior
 engine
 manager
 director


senior
 director
 etc.
 What
 do
 you
 think


might
 happen
 just
 in
 taking
 educated


guess?


>> Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 um
 you
 know,
 anytime


somebody
 asks
 me
 about
 career
 path
 as
 an


engineer,
 but
 the
 first
 thing
 I
 tell


people
 is
 don't
 be
 a
 manager.
 Okay.
 Um


you
 know,
 in
 fact,
 I
 did
 that
 myself


when
 I
 started
 out.
 Somebody
 gave
 me


that
 advice.
 And
 so
 the
 for
 the
 first


many
 years
 of
 my
 career,
 I
 avoided
 being


a
 manager
 as
 far
 as
 I
 could
 um
 until
 I


found
 decisions
 being
 made
 that
 I
 didn't


understand.
 And
 so
 then
 I
 popped
 my
 head


up
 to
 see
 okay
 what
 the
 hell
 is


happening
 and
 that
 sort
 of
 thing
 and


then
 joined
 the
 dark
 side.
 But
 like
 um


you
 know


>> worked
 out
 pretty
 good
 in
 the
 end.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But
 uh
 I'd
 say
 like
 you
 know


for
 for
 engineers
 like
 I
 mean
 it's
 it's


it's
 a
 great
 time
 to
 be
 alive.
 Like
 I


would
 just
 write
 code,
 use
 agents,


figure
 this
 out,
 do
 all
 the
 advanced,


you
 know,
 cutting
 edge
 stuff
 for
 a


while.
 I
 mean
 we
 don't
 know
 where
 the


future
 is
 going
 but
 like
 you'll
 be
 fine


if
 you're
 an
 engineer
 writing
 code.


Managers
 and
 leaders,
 it's
 a
 little


tougher.
 I
 think
 there
 might
 be
 fewer
 of


them.
 I
 think
 uh
 it's
 exciting
 if
 you


are
 want
 to
 be
 hands-on
 that
 it's


amazing.
 Um
 I
 think
 there's
 less
 of
 like


leadership
 management
 blah
 blah
 blah.


It's
 more
 of
 like
 doing
 and
 like


figuring
 things
 out
 in
 this
 new
 world.


And
 those
 who
 do
 I
 think
 will
 do
 well.


Those
 who
 want
 to
 like
 stick
 to
 the
 old


career
 paths
 might
 have
 to
 find


something
 else.


I
 have
 three
 things.
 One,
 number
 one,


for
 all
 the
 startup
 founders.
 Every
 time


an
 investor
 asks
 you
 how
 they're


preventing
 the
 incumbent
 doing
 the
 same


thing
 that
 you're
 doing,
 just
 tell
 them


that
 the
 CTO
 of
 Atlassian
 had
 to
 buy
 a


laptop
 on
 his
 own
 money
 to
 start
 coding.


That's
 the
 best
 answer
 I
 can
 give


because
 it
 shows
 you
 how
 even,
 you
 know,


relatively
 agile
 companies
 that
 actually


develop
 agile
 tools,
 you
 know,
 can't


really
 do
 what
 you
 can
 do
 in
 5
 minutes.


Um,
 I
 I'll
 fix
 it.
 I'll
 fix
 it
 once
 I


acquire
 your
 company,
 Thomas.
 Oh,
 you


can
 you
 can
 get
 their
 assets.
 You
 can


get
 their
 assets
 and
 use
 them
 for


coding.
 Um,
 number
 two
 is
 I
 think
 what


happened
 in
 the
 last
 two
 years
 uh


through
 um
 coding
 agents
 like
 C-pilot,


Kursa
 and
 Devon
 is
 that
 many
 CTOs
 and


CIOS
 even
 in
 the
 largest
 banks
 in
 this


country
 and
 many
 other
 countries
 have


realized
 they
 can
 go
 back
 to
 coding


because
 it
 no
 longer
 takes
 hours
 to


install
 all
 the
 packages
 and
 figure
 out


all
 the
 problems.
 And
 so
 I
 actually
 I


have
 friends
 in
 that
 in
 that
 space
 that


told
 me
 stories
 of
 like
 on
 every
 night


they
 would
 give
 Devon
 a
 task
 and
 and
 say


Devon
 built
 me
 this
 and
 then
 on
 the


morning
 would
 check
 the
 check
 in
 with


the
 developer
 at
 the
 agent
 and
 then
 keep


going
 that
 way
 and
 then
 they
 have
 their


normal
 day-to-day
 as
 a
 as
 a
 CTO
 of
 a
 big


bank
 and
 you
 do
 that
 for
 two
 weeks
 and


you
 realize
 everything
 is
 going
 to


change
 and
 has
 to
 change
 in
 my


organization
 and
 in
 contrast
 to
 the
 you


know
 Twilio
 founders
 ask
 your
 developer


where
 the
 developer
 decides
 bottoms
 up


what
 the
 tools
 are.
 Those
 folks
 went


into
 the
 into
 their
 organization
 says
 I


don't
 want
 to
 hear
 any
 excuses.
 We're


going
 to
 roll
 out
 agents
 and
 you
 know
 um


many
 banks
 still
 are
 on
 very
 archive


systems
 and
 they
 have
 developers
 like
 to


Citrix
 and
 and
 what
 have
 you
 and
 often


the
 CTO
 was
 not
 empowered
 to
 override


this
 because
 of
 CISO
 concerns
 and
 and


what
 have
 you.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 has


dramatically
 changed
 because
 basic
 gets


our
 hands
 dirty
 again
 and
 realize
 how


powerful
 this
 technology
 is.
 And
 that


shift
 is
 happening.
 You
 see
 this


everywhere
 like
 no
 other
 software


development
 technology
 has
 been
 adopted


as
 fast
 as
 agents
 right
 like
 most
 German


companies
 you
 know
 Japanese
 companies


other
 international
 are
 still
 not
 in
 the


cloud
 uh
 because
 of
 all
 the
 kinds
 of


concerns
 that
 they
 heard
 from
 the
 legal


team
 security
 teams
 and
 whatnot
 and
 then


there's
 the
 third
 piece
 you
 know
 when


you
 ask
 about
 leadership
 and
 manager
 you


know
 when
 I
 became
 a
 manager
 um
 the


first
 time
 I
 became
 really
 manager
 was


when
 I
 my
 startup
 got
 acquired
 by


Microsoft
 because
 CEO
 of
 a
 10
 person


startup
 you're
 not
 actually
 a
 manager


you're
 just
 one
 of
 10
 and
 you're
 the


speaker
 and
 it
 has
 to
 do
 payroll
 and
 and


and
 pitch
 to
 customers
 and
 I
 became
 a


manager
 and
 I
 realized,
 oh
 god,
 now
 I


have
 to
 hire
 people,
 which
 means
 I
 have


to
 write
 a
 job
 description
 and
 do


interviews
 and
 I
 have
 to
 write


performance
 reviews.
 You
 know,
 when
 CHPT


came
 out,
 all
 of a
 sudden
 we
 just
 would


ask
 Chet
 PT
 to
 write
 the
 performance


review
 for
 us
 and
 of
 course
 the


employees
 did
 the
 same
 on
 their
 site
 and


if
 you
 have
 worked
 at
 Microsoft
 every


like
 the
 employee
 has
 to
 fill
 out
 like
 I


think
 seven
 input
 fields
 on
 their
 side


and
 then
 the
 manager
 has
 to
 react
 to


those
 seven
 input
 fields.
 And
 if
 you're


uh
 a
 lazy
 developer
 manager,
 you
 write
 I


agree
 with
 you
 and
 the
 employee
 is
 not


happy
 about
 that.


>> Hang
 on.


>> And
 so
 you
 kind
 of
 hack
 that
 system
 by


just
 asking
 Chatty
 which
 then
 in
 reverse


is
 then
 give
 me
 just
 the
 bullets
 that


you
 put
 into
 Chat
 GBT.
 So
 at
 least
 I


know
 how
 you're
 prompting.


>> So
 you
 became
 the
 CEO
 of
 GitHub
 with


this
 mentality.


>> You
 know
 that
 God
 does
 GitHub.
 you
 know


the
 you
 know
 the
 the
 the
 key
 um
 the
 key


I
 know
 pragma
 if
 you
 will
 or
 dogma
 um
 by


the
 way
 we
 are
 joking
 in
 the
 green
 room


I
 think
 the
 next
 one
 is
 the
 dogmatic


summit
 and
 so
 we
 have
 all
 the
 dogmas
 on


stage
 is
 much
 more
 entertaining
 I
 think


um
 is
 developers
 first
 right
 developers


first
 is
 what
 what
 we
 always
 said
 at


GitHub
 for
 everything
 we
 design
 for


every
 process
 for
 the
 marketing
 and
 when


we
 fail
 um
 you
 can
 see
 that
 a
 hacker


news
 is
 very
 very
 straight
 right
 like


when
 a
 GitHub
 blog
 post
 or
 GitHub
 tweet


or
 a
 message
 is
 too
 corporate,
 quote


unquote.
 Developers
 won't
 like
 that
 and


they
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 that.
 Um,
 give


me
 the
 truth,
 give
 me
 the
 direct


conversation,
 don't
 give
 me
 all
 the


marketing
 bull.
 That
 works
 for
 other


products,
 but
 it
 doesn't
 work
 for


developer
 tools,
 right?
 And
 I
 think
 the


same
 is
 true
 for
 being
 a
 people
 manager,


an
 engineering
 manager
 of
 a
 team,
 like


your
 team
 knows
 exactly
 whether
 you're


talking
 straight
 to
 them
 and
 giving
 them


the
 truth
 or
 whether
 you're
 sugar


coating
 that
 they're
 actually
 not
 doing


so
 well
 and
 you're
 kind
 of
 like
 trying


to
 tell
 give
 them
 the
 message
 that
 you


either
 improve
 or
 or
 you
 get
 the
 out,


right?
 And
 and
 and
 I
 think
 this
 is
 where


you
 know
 the
 AI
 is
 changing
 this
 because


this
 I'm
 spending
 an
 hour
 of
 writing
 a
 a


a
 pified
 you
 know
 summary
 of
 a


performance
 of
 course
 the
 engineer
 just


feeds
 that
 into
 chatbt
 backwards
 and


says
 what
 did
 Thomas
 actually
 mean
 and


did
 he
 use
 AI
 to
 write
 this
 and
 all
 of


that
 and
 I
 think
 this
 is
 this
 is
 a
 good


thing
 like
 you
 know
 when
 we
 when
 we


think
 about
 um
 AIdriven
 sales
 processes


hell
 I
 don't
 want
 an
 AI
 email
 from
 a


sales
 uh
 uh
 uh
 from
 a
 sales
 agent
 to


sell
 me
 some
 outsource
 ing
 company
 or


something
 like
 that.
 Just
 I
 want
 an
 AI


that
 deletes
 all
 that
 and
 tells
 them
 to


never
 contact
 me
 again,
 right?
 And
 I


think
 the
 same
 is
 true
 like
 for
 people


management.
 It's
 so
 much
 more
 it's
 so


much
 more
 enjoyable
 when
 you
 have
 a


relationship
 with
 your
 pe
 with
 your
 with


your
 team
 members,
 your
 IC's
 that's
 on


on
 an
 honest
 trustworthy
 basis
 like
 you


hopefully
 have
 you
 know
 with
 your
 spouse


at
 home
 and
 and
 your
 kids
 and
 whatnot.


And
 I
 think
 that
 is
 going
 to
 shift


because
 you
 can
 no
 longer
 cheat
 your
 way


as
 a
 people
 manager
 into
 being
 the


nicest
 manager
 of
 everybody
 while
 in


reality
 uh
 you
 you're
 having
 you're


struggling
 with
 all
 the
 problems
 in
 your


team.


>> I
 mean
 you
 heard
 it
 from
 the
 former
 the


last
 CEO
 of
 of
 GitHub
 you
 know


management
 might
 actually
 become
 like
 a


bit
 more
 enjoyable.
 Thanks
 for
 that.


looking
 at
 your
 current
 teams
 now,
 what


is
 the
 biggest
 change
 that's
 already


happened
 in
 in
 how
 you're
 working
 and


what
 do
 you
 expect
 to
 happen
 this
 coming


year?


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 mean
 like
 clearly
 the
 biggest


change
 is
 agentic
 coding
 and
 using
 um


agents
 to
 do
 stuff
 like
 in
 Atlassian


rodev
 is
 used
 by
 all
 our
 engineers
 um


>> all
 the
 engineers.


>> Yes.
 Yes.


>> Nice.


>> Yes.
 Uh
 code
 reviews.
 I
 mean
 every
 day
 I


see
 the
 percentage
 of
 you
 know
 diffs


that
 are
 through
 code
 reviews
 are


increasing
 quite
 a
 bit.
 um
 PRs
 per


engineer
 have
 gone
 up
 89%.
 Issue
 cycle


time
 has
 got
 has
 gone
 down
 42%.
 51%
 of


security
 vulnerabilities
 are
 now
 cut


through
 agents.
 So
 we're
 seeing
 like


massive
 change
 in
 in
 our
 productivity


output
 metrics
 the
 Dora
 metrics
 all
 of


that
 is
 going
 up
 you
 know
 going
 well
 up


meaning
 well
 um
 because
 of
 agent


encoding
 and
 that
 sort
 of
 thing.
 And
 uh


more
 than
 the
 metrics
 I'd
 say
 like
 we


are
 we
 are
 really
 excited
 about
 how
 we


are
 working
 across
 PM
 design
 and


engineering
 because
 we
 build
 a
 lot
 of


products
 like
 Jira
 confluence
 and
 so


that
 that
 loop
 is
 very
 important
 for
 us


and
 we
 are
 finding
 that
 because
 uh
 PMs


are
 using
 like
 replet
 and
 things
 like


that
 they're
 producing
 actually
 better


specs
 that
 are
 much
 more
 uh
 aminable
 to


being
 close
 to
 the
 product
 that
 we
 want


easier
 for
 engineers
 to
 go
 implement
 and


so
 definitely
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 change.


What
 will
 happen
 in
 the
 future
 I
 think


is
 um
 this
 notion
 of
 building
 products


with
 actually
 zero
 lines
 of
 code
 manual


coding
 I
 would
 say
 uh
 because
 today
 it's


a
 mix
 of
 like
 some
 manual
 coding
 some


agents
 um
 I
 think
 we
 will
 get
 to
 the


point
 where
 we
 just
 trust
 the
 code


reviews
 done
 by
 the
 agents
 and
 not
 have


to
 have
 too
 much
 human
 review
 over
 that


um
 I
 think
 we
 move
 towards
 more


verification
 of
 inputs
 and
 outputs
 to


see
 the
 system
 performing
 according
 to


the
 right
 security
 reliability


performance
 bars
 less
 about
 inspection


of
 code
 and
 And
 then
 if
 I
 were
 to
 look


out
 I
 know
 that
 TB
 didn't
 want
 to
 look


out
 two
 years
 but
 if
 I
 look
 out
 two


years
 uh
 plus
 uh
 maybe
 we
 don't
 have


programming
 languages
 and
 IDEs
 anymore


and
 we
 have
 some
 kind
 of
 AI
 JVM
 or


something
 that
 just
 sort
 of
 does
 things


and
 because
 like
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it


programming
 languages
 are
 there
 because


like
 you
 know
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 write


assembly
 and
 we
 need
 something
 to
 tell


the
 computer
 what
 to
 do
 but
 like
 if
 AI


is
 able
 to
 do
 that
 and
 you
 know
 you're


able
 to
 debug
 using
 AI
 as
 well
 then
 it


shifts
 to
 a
 higher
 level
 intent
 and
 you


don't
 need
 maybe
 programming.
 Now
 that's


super
 extreme.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it'll
 go


there,
 but
 it
 is
 conceivable
 and
 so


that's
 really
 exciting
 to
 think
 about


what
 that
 word
 would
 look
 like.
 From
 the


CEO
 perspective,
 I
 think
 there's
 two


drastic
 changes.
 One
 is
 uh
 costs
 are


through
 the
 roof.
 Um
 and
 as
 everybody


who
 manages
 a
 larger
 team
 has
 some
 fixed


opex
 budget
 uh
 that
 is
 you
 know
 mostly


your
 salaries,
 your
 benefits
 and
 then


some
 travel
 and
 expenses,
 right?
 All
 of


a
 sudden,
 we
 have
 flexible
 token
 costs.


And
 the
 more
 productive
 you
 you
 had
 all


this
 impressive
 statistics,
 the
 more


productive
 your
 developers
 are,
 the
 more


your
 costs
 are
 going
 through
 the
 roof


and
 you
 actually
 create
 an
 inversion


where
 you
 have
 to
 slow
 down
 some


developers
 because
 they're
 burning
 so


many
 tokens
 and
 then
 they're
 like,


"Well,
 then
 I
 will
 build
 less
 features,


right?"
 And
 that's
 something
 that
 a


startup
 founder
 only
 deals
 with
 when


when
 the
 money
 runs
 out,
 the
 run
 rate


gets
 shorter.
 But
 a
 a
 big
 manager
 in
 a


in
 a
 corporation
 will
 actually
 have
 to


figure
 out
 with
 their
 with
 their
 finance


team,
 right?
 What
 the
 traditional


approach
 to
 this
 will
 no
 longer
 work.


and
 you
 actually
 want
 to
 encourage
 teams


to
 burn
 more
 tokens.
 And
 you
 talked
 in
 a


very
 early
 session
 this
 morning
 about


OpenAI's
 billions
 uh
 tokens
 and
 they


don't
 have
 to
 pay
 for
 them.
 Obviously,


that's
 not
 true.
 They're
 paying
 for
 the


GPUs
 to
 to
 Azure
 and
 and
 Oracle
 and
 and


whatnot.
 But
 that's
 I
 think
 a
 drastic


change
 to
 how
 we're
 managing
 teams.
 Um


that
 all
 of a
 sudden
 you
 had
 and
 look


what
 nobody
 wants
 to
 do
 is
 fire
 people


to
 offset
 the
 cost
 of
 the
 tokens,
 right?


Because
 the
 the
 human
 cost
 of
 that
 is
 is


way
 higher
 than
 the
 benefits.
 I
 think


the
 very
 positive
 version
 of
 that
 is


coding
 is
 fun
 again.
 And
 I,
 you
 know,
 I


learned
 coding
 on
 a
 Commodore
 64
 in
 the


early
 1990s
 and
 then
 I
 had
 a
 3860x40


with
 a
 turbo
 switch
 and
 a
 pensium
 and


whatnot.
 And
 I
 remember
 the
 days
 when
 I


couldn't
 solve
 any
 of
 my
 problems


because
 all
 I
 had
 was
 books
 and
 computer


club
 was
 only
 Wednesdays
 and
 you
 were


just
 stuck,
 right?
 And
 you
 went
 to
 bed


frustrated
 and
 and
 and
 uh
 and
 then
 in


the
 morning
 hopefully
 you
 had
 some,
 you


know,
 intuition
 of
 how
 to
 solve
 that


problem.
 Came
 the
 internet,
 came
 forums,


all
 of a
 sudden
 you
 could
 talk
 to


people.
 Now
 you
 can
 just
 in
 3
 seconds,


you
 know,
 ask
 the
 agents
 to
 figure
 it


out.
 And
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 we're


underestimating
 the
 power
 of
 these


agents
 because
 we
 all
 think
 about
 code


generation.
 I
 think
 the
 best
 scenario
 is


actually
 have
 some
 stupid
 build
 error
 or


npm
 error
 or
 something
 on
 the
 terminal


and
 just
 feed
 that
 into
 codeex
 and
 say,


"Hey,
 go
 and
 solve
 this.
 I
 don't
 want
 to


deal
 with
 any
 of
 that."
 Right?
 I
 think


that's
 it's
 way
 more
 fun
 than
 it
 ever


was.
 Same
 for
 unit
 testing.
 Raise
 your


hand
 if
 you
 love
 wring
 unit
 tests.


Right?
 Like,
 oh,
 that's
 the
 one.
 Um
 uh


>> I'm
 I'm I'm
 looking
 for
 Ken
 back.


>> No,
 the
 the
 exception
 to
 the
 rule,


right?
 But
 like
 that
 that's
 so
 powerful


to
 just
 say
 write
 write
 me
 unit
 tests


and
 and
 or
 or
 fix
 the
 tests
 and
 and
 and


what
 have
 you.
 Coding
 is
 fun
 again
 and


it
 brings
 us
 back
 to
 when
 we
 learned


coding.
 I
 think
 what
 agents
 have
 done
 is


it
 bring
 us
 back
 to
 the
 joy
 of
 um
 uh


coding
 and
 I
 was
 at
 OpenAI
 a
 month
 ago


or
 so
 and
 they
 showed
 a
 couple
 of


builders
 the
 new
 Codex
 Mac
 app
 um
 and
 uh


made
 sure
 we're
 all
 in
 the
 NDA
 but
 now


the
 app
 is
 out
 so
 I
 can
 talk
 about
 it


and
 um
 was
 a
 bit
 you
 know
 food
 and
 and


presentation
 and
 then
 we
 all
 had
 some


coding
 time
 and
 I
 built
 three
 native
 Mac


apps
 like
 in
 Swift
 UI
 without
 ever


looking
 at
 the
 code
 right
 and
 and
 that's


just
 and
 I
 had a
 menu
 by
 app
 and


somebody
 was
 yesterday
 on
 X
 saying
 I


love
 building
 menu
 by
 apps
 on
 on
 Mac,


right?
 And
 it's
 so
 easy.
 And
 if
 you
 ever


tried
 that
 yourself
 in
 in
 going
 on,
 you


know,
 GitHub,
 Google,
 stack
 overflow,


whatever,
 have
 it
 even
 setting
 up
 just


the
 Xcode
 project
 to
 hide
 the
 doc
 icon


and
 have
 it
 only
 in
 the
 menu
 bar,
 you


you
 have
 given
 up
 and
 and
 the
 idea
 has,


you
 know,
 flown
 away
 by
 the
 time
 you


actually
 had
 the
 first
 build
 running.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 just
 so
 incredible.


And
 whether
 that
 applies
 to
 all
 our


hobby
 projects,
 but
 ultimately
 got
 us


into
 this
 profession,
 hopefully.
 uh


whether
 or
 it's
 uh
 you
 know
 doing
 work


at
 Atlassian
 or
 at
 ENTIA
 or
 GitHub.
 I


think
 that's
 what
 what
 is
 so
 amazing


about
 this
 and
 that
 is
 the
 actual
 um


drastic
 and
 the
 productivity
 is
 great


you
 know
 for
 the
 CFO
 and
 the
 CEO
 and
 the


and
 and
 and
 then
 the
 the
 stock
 public


stock
 markets
 but
 what
 really
 matters
 to


us
 is
 our
 job
 is
 fun
 again


>> 100%.


>> And
 I
 I
 I
 love
 that.
 So
 thank
 you
 so


much
 Rajie
 and
 Tomas
 and
 especially
 for


that
 nice
 ending.
 This
 was
 great.
 Thank


you.
 Let's
 give
 a
 round
 of
 applause
 to


them.
