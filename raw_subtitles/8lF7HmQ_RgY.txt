What
 if
 you
 could
 merge
 600
 commits
 on
 a


single
 day
 and
 none
 of
 it
 was
 slopp?


This
 is
 what
 today's
 guest,
 Peter


Stainberger,
 the
 creator
 of
 Claudebot,


claims
 he's
 doing.
 Peter
 is
 a
 standout


developer
 who
 built
 PSP
 PDF
 kit,
 the
 PDF


framework
 used
 on
 more
 than
 1
 billion


devices.
 Then
 he
 burned
 out,
 sold
 his


shares,
 and
 disappeared
 from
 tech
 for
 3


years.
 This
 year,
 he
 came
 back
 and
 how


he
 builds
 and
 what
 he's
 doing
 now
 looks


nothing
 like
 traditional
 software


development.
 In
 today's
 episode,
 we


cover
 why
 he
 no
 longer
 reads
 most
 of
 the


code
 he
 ships,
 and
 why
 that's
 not
 as


crazy
 as
 it
 sounds.
 How
 he
 is
 building


Clawbot,
 his
 wildly
 popular
 personal


assistant
 project,
 which
 feels
 like
 the


future
 of
 Siri,
 the
 closing
 the
 loop


principle
 that
 separates
 effective
 AI


assistant
 coding
 from
 frustrating
 vibe


coding.
 Why
 he
 says
 code
 reviews
 are


dead
 and
 PR
 should
 be
 called
 prompt


requests,
 and
 many
 more.
 If
 you're


interested
 in
 how
 the
 software
 engine


workflow
 could
 change
 in
 the
 coming


years
 thanks
 to
 AI,
 this
 episode
 is
 for


you.
 This
 episode
 is
 presented
 by


Statsig,
 the
 unified
 platform
 for
 flags,


analytics
 experiments,
 and
 more.
 Check


out
 the
 show
 notes
 to
 learn
 more
 about


them,
 the
 pragmatic
 summit
 on
 the
 11th


February
 in
 San
 Francisco
 that
 I'm


hosting
 with
 them,
 and
 our
 other
 season


sponsors.
 Right,
 Pete,
 welcome
 to
 the


podcast.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me,
 Gay.


>> It
 is
 awesome
 to
 meet
 you
 in
 in
 person.


>> Yeah,
 and
 I
 almost
 messed
 it
 up.


>> Yeah.
 What
 what what
 what
 happened?
 You


lost
 track
 of
 time.
 Does
 that
 happen


often?
 And
 how
 how
 so?
 Um,
 not
 usually.


Not
 usually.
 Um,
 this
 is
 an
 interesting


time
 for
 me
 cuz
 I
 cuz
 my
 latest
 project


is
 is
 blowing
 up.
 Cloud,
 right?


>> Clawbot.
 Yeah,


>> Cloudbot.


>> I'm
 struggling
 a
 bit
 to
 get
 enough


sleep,
 but
 it's
 it's
 it's
 interesting.
 I


never
 I
 never
 had
 a
 community
 blowing
 up


so
 fast
 and
 it's
 just
 incredibly
 fun
 to


work
 with.


>> So,
 before
 we
 we
 get
 into
 Clubbot
 and


all
 the
 fun
 stuff
 you're
 doing,
 I
 wanted


to
 rewind
 all
 the
 way
 way
 back.
 You


create
 a
 PSPDF
 kit
 which
 is
 used
 I
 think


on
 more
 than
 1
 billion
 devices
 users.
 If


if
 you
 see
 a
 PDF
 render
 you
 probably
 see


that.
 But
 even
 before
 that
 how
 did
 you


get
 into
 tech?
 Oh
 my
 god.
 How
 did
 you


get
 into
 tech?
 So
 I'm
 from
 rural


Austria.
 Um
 always
 more
 being
 the


introvert.


So
 eventually
 I
 we
 always
 had
 like


summer
 guests
 and
 one
 of
 them
 one
 of


them
 was
 a
 was
 a
 computer
 nerd
 and
 then


I
 kind
 of
 got
 hooked
 with
 with
 like
 the


machine
 he
 had
 and
 begged
 my
 mom
 to
 buy


me
 one


and
 ever
 since
 then
 I
 this
 was
 in
 high


school
 or
 so.


>> I
 guess
 I
 was
 14.


>> Yeah.
 And
 ever
 since
 I
 started


tinkering,
 like
 I
 can
 remember
 the


earliest
 thing
 was
 like
 I
 stole
 an
 old


DOS
 game
 from
 my
 school
 and
 then
 wrote
 a


copy
 protection
 for
 the
 floppy
 disc
 so
 I


could
 sell
 it.


It
 took
 like
 2
 minutes
 to
 load.
 I
 was


just
 always
 tinkering.
 Also
 playing
 a


lot
 of
 computer
 games
 of
 course,
 but


like
 building
 stuff
 almost
 feels
 like


playing
 a
 computer
 game.
 Like
 definitely


right
 now
 it
 feels
 better
 than
 Factorio.


Oh,
 when
 I
 started
 out,
 I
 I
 I
 I
 read


like


the
 equivalent
 of
 bash
 scripts
 for


Windows
 and
 then
 I
 did
 like
 websites.


So,
 I
 guess
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 JavaScript,


uh,
 even
 though
 I
 had
 no
 clue
 what
 I
 was


doing.
 And
 then
 the
 actual
 first


language
 where
 I
 I
 had
 to
 learn
 how
 to


build
 things
 is
 when
 I
 started


university.


And
 I
 never
 met
 my
 dad.
 And
 I
 come
 from


a
 from
 a
 poor
 family.
 So,
 I
 always
 had


to
 work.
 like
 I
 had
 to
 had
 to
 finance
 my


own
 studies,
 right?
 So
 when
 other
 people


were
 were
 having
 holiday,
 I
 just
 worked


full-time
 at
 a
 company.
 So
 the
 the
 first


real
 job
 I
 had
 was
 was
 in
 Vienna
 was


supposed
 to
 be
 1
 months
 and
 then
 they


kept
 me
 for
 6
 months.
 It
 was
 just
 a


bridge
 between
 military
 and
 and
 my


university.
 And
 I
 kept
 working
 there
 for


like
 I
 think
 5
 years.
 And
 I
 remember
 the


first
 day
 they
 they
 gave
 me
 this
 huge


book.
 maybe
 that
 huge
 and
 say
 Microsoft


MFC.
 Um
 I
 still
 have
 nightmares
 and
 I


got
 I
 got
 like
 I
 was
 like
 this
 is


terrible
 like
 for
 for
 the
 next
 win
 I


just
 I
 just
 silently
 used
 net
 I
 just


didn't
 tell
 them
 and
 like
 a
 few
 months


in
 I
 just
 told
 them
 yeah
 but
 the
 text
 I


I
 did
 a
 few
 modernizations
 but
 then
 it


was
 too
 late.
 I
 did
 this
 a
 few
 times
 in


this
 company.
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 they
 kept


me
 because
 because
 my
 [ __ ]
 worked.
 So
 uh


I
 did
 net
 and
 actually
 I
 actually


actually
 dig
 it.NET
 2.0
 had
 like


generics.
 It
 took
 insanely
 long
 for
 the


application
 to
 to
 to
 launch
 because
 like


everything
 was
 compiled
 at
 first
 start


and
 like
 your
 hard
 disk
 was
 like


if
 you
 remember


>> so
 so
 you
 you
 how
 did
 you
 stumble
 into


both
 iOS
 and
 where
 did
 the
 idea
 from


PSPDF


>> come
 from?


>> Not
 even
 yeah
 the
 first
 one
 the
 first


one
 wasn't
 even
 available
 in
 in
 in


Austria.
 That's
 true.
 Yeah.


>> A
 little
 time
 goes
 went
 on
 and
 I
 was
 at


university
 and
 a
 friend
 showed
 me
 the


iPhone
 and
 I
 I
 think
 I
 I
 touched
 it
 for


a
 minute
 and
 then
 immediately
 bought
 one


like
 like
 this
 like
 it
 it
 clicked
 when
 I


felt
 it
 and
 and
 to
 me
 this
 was
 like
 a


holy
 f
 moment
 cuz
 it
 was
 just
 like
 so


different
 and
 so
 much
 better.
 So
 I
 got
 I


got
 one.
 I
 was
 still
 not
 thinking
 about


building
 for
 it,
 you
 know.
 That
 was
 that


was


>> when
 was
 this
 2009
 10
 something
 like


that.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 then
 I
 I
 used
 their


browser.
 I
 I
 can
 see
 the
 story.
 I
 was
 I


was
 literally
 driving
 in
 the
 subway.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 by
 the
 time
 I
 was
 using
 a
 gay
 dating


app
 and
 this
 was
 iPhone
 OS
 2.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 So
 I
 I


>> long
 time
 ago


>> I
 typed
 this
 long
 message.
 I
 pressed


send
 and
 we
 were
 just
 going
 into
 a


tunnel
 and
 the
 JavaScript
 disabled
 the


send
 button
 and
 then
 an
 error
 message


came
 but
 there
 was
 no
 copy
 paste.
 There


was
 no
 screenshot.
 So
 I
 was
 just
 like


and
 I
 couldn't
 scroll
 anymore
 because


like
 scrolling
 was
 disabled.
 So
 like


this
 long
 message
 was
 like
 a
 little
 bit


emotional
 was
 gone
 and
 I
 was
 so
 mad.
 I


was
 so
 mad.
 I'm
 like
 what
 the
 hell?
 I


went
 home
 and
 I
 downloaded
 Xcode.
 That's


that's
 where
 that's
 where
 the
 window


came
 and
 I
 was
 like
 where
 is
 the
 ID?


So
 it
 was
 like
 like
 I
 was
 like
 this
 is


unacceptable.
 I
 basically
 hacked
 the


website.
 I
 used
 regular
 expressions
 to


like
 download
 uh
 to
 parse
 the
 HTML
 which


is
 like
 totally
 not
 something
 you
 should


do
 and
 I
 built
 an
 app
 and
 I
 used
 I
 used


iPhone
 OS3
 beta
 with
 like
 core
 data
 in


beta
 regaxit
 light.
 I
 used
 a
 hacked


version
 of
 GCC
 that
 backported
 the


blocks
 compiler
 so
 I
 could
 use
 blocks
 in


iPhone
 OS3.
 It
 took
 me
 quite
 a
 while


until
 anything
 worked
 because
 like
 I
 had


no
 idea
 what
 I
 was
 doing
 and
 I
 was
 like


using
 all
 kind
 of
 like
 beta
 tech
 but


eventually
 I
 I
 got
 it
 to
 work
 and
 I
 I
 I


wrote
 that
 company
 was
 like
 hey
 I'm


making
 an
 app.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 about


it?
 Got
 no
 response
 of
 course.
 So
 I
 was


like
 let's
 just
 put
 it
 in
 the
 app
 store.


>> And
 this
 was
 for
 the
 dating
 app
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> So
 you
 just
 like
 you
 know
 you
 looked
 at


you
 saw
 their
 APIs
 you
 could
 just
 like


easily
 like
 build
 a
 client
 on
 top


>> API.
 It
 was
 HTML.


>> Oh


>> I
 was
 I
 was
 just
 literally
 parsing
 HTML.


>> Oh.
 So,
 so
 you
 kind
 of
 parse
 the
 HTML,


kind
 of
 turn
 it
 into
 your
 own,
 you
 know,


like
 you
 use
 it
 as
 an
 API.
 Oh,
 clever.
 I


mean,
 this
 was
 back
 in
 the
 day
 where
 no


one
 thought
 this
 this
 would
 happen,
 but


I
 made
 I
 put
 it
 in
 the
 app
 store.
 I


charged
 five
 bucks
 for
 it
 and
 I
 made


like
 10k
 in
 the
 first
 month.


And
 I
 had
 no
 clue
 what
 I
 was
 doing.
 So,


and
 there
 was
 like
 so
 many
 complex
 tech


stuff.
 This
 was
 very
 early
 on
 where


there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 weird
 forums
 on


Apple.


>> So,
 I
 just
 put
 in
 the
 the
 bank
 account


of
 my
 grandpa.
 And
 then
 one
 day
 my


grandpa
 called
 me,
 "Yeah,
 something
 is


weird.
 Like
 I
 got
 this
 huge
 payment
 from


Apple."
 I'm
 like,
 "This
 is
 mine.
 This
 is


mine.
 Don't
 touch
 it."
 But
 the
 the
 funny


thing
 was
 when
 I
 this
 blew
 off
 and
 I


remember
 I
 was
 in
 a
 club
 one
 day
 and


like
 I
 saw
 someone
 using
 my
 app
 and
 I


was
 so
 proud
 and
 I
 wanted
 to
 like
 tap


him
 on
 the
 shoulder
 and
 say
 I
 built
 this


and
 I
 thought
 like
 that
 would
 be
 really


weird.
 So
 I
 didn't.
 And
 then
 I
 I
 I
 went


to
 the
 company
 I
 worked
 for
 for
 5
 years


and
 told
 him
 like
 I'm
 going
 to
 pursue


this.
 This
 is
 this
 is
 really
 exciting.


And
 my
 boss
 was
 like
 mocking
 me.


>> Oh,
 really?


>> They're
 like,
 "Oh,
 you're
 making
 a


mistake.
 This
 is
 a
 fat.
 This
 will
 not


go."
 Blah,
 blah,
 blah,
 blah,
 blah.
 And


you
 know
 what
 that
 got
 me?
 That's
 what


you
 call
 a
 chip
 on
 your
 shoulder.
 I'm


like,


>> you
 know,
 one
 day
 I'm
 going
 to
 I'm
 going


to
 have
 a
 company
 that
 that's
 worth
 more


money
 than
 yours.
 Well,
 it
 took
 me
 eight


years.
 So,
 I
 I
 got
 hooked.
 Like,
 I
 I


worked


I
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an
 addictive


personality.
 So
 which
 you
 see
 again


right
 now.
 But
 I
 I
 worked
 a
 lot
 on
 this


app.
 I
 learned
 I
 learned
 in
 in
 high


speed
 and
 this
 was
 also
 the
 time
 where
 I


started
 Twitter
 and
 that
 was
 usually


hugely
 influential
 for
 my
 career.
 I
 made


this
 app
 actually
 quite
 good
 and
 then


one
 day
 I
 was
 at
 a
 party
 at
 at
 3:00
 a.m.


um
 slightly
 intoxicated
 and
 I
 got
 a
 call


from
 a
 US
 number.
 The
 guy
 on
 the
 phone


was
 like,
 "Yeah,
 hello.
 This
 is
 John


from
 Apple.
 Yeah,
 there's
 a
 problem
 with


your
 application.
 Like
 some
 people


reported
 pictures
 and
 that
 was
 it.
 That


was
 the
 end
 of
 my
 app.
 Um,


>> it
 was
 good
 until
 it
 lasted


>> and
 I
 was
 just
 I
 just
 quit
 my
 my
 job
 and


was
 like,
 well,


f
 you
 Apple.


>> I
 did
 freelance
 work.
 I
 was
 at
 dubdub.


I
 was
 introduced
 to


>> dubdubdubc.


>> Yes.
 Sorry
 for
 the
 insider
 terms.
 I
 was


introduced
 to
 someone
 as
 one
 of
 the
 best


iOS
 developers
 in
 Austria
 at
 a
 bar
 at
 2


a.m.
 in
 San
 Francisco
 and
 then
 basically


got
 a
 job
 in
 the
 US
 and
 then
 I
 moved
 to


the
 US
 for
 a
 while
 and
 then
 I
 I
 went
 to


the
 Nokia
 development
 days.
 This
 is
 all


like
 stone
 age
 by
 now.
 My
 god.
 And
 then


someone
 came
 up
 to
 me
 and
 said,
 "Yeah,


they
 built
 this
 app
 somewhere
 in
 Eastern


Europe
 and
 it
 works
 but
 it
 crashes


sometimes
 and
 it
 was
 like
 was
 like
 a


magazine
 viewer,
 right?
 This
 was
 back


when
 the
 iPad
 just
 came
 out
 and
 Steve


Jobs
 hit
 that
 like
 this
 is
 the
 savior.


So
 everybody
 was
 building
 magazine
 apps


and
 I
 was
 like
 that
 sounds
 like
 an


interesting
 short-term
 gig.
 And
 I
 I
 was


like
 okay
 I
 I'll
 I'll
 I'll
 help
 you
 out.


And
 I
 opened
 the
 app
 and
 it
 was
 like
 oh


the
 worst
 code
 I've


ever
 seen
 in
 my
 life.
 It
 was
 literally


one
 file
 with
 like
 thousands
 of
 lines


>> of
 Objective
 C.
 Yes.
 Where
 they
 used


windows
 as
 tabs.
 I
 I
 didn't
 know
 this


worked.
 I
 was
 surprised
 this
 worked
 at


all,
 but
 it
 felt
 like
 a
 a
 house
 of


cards.
 And
 I
 I
 tried
 to
 I
 tried
 to


surgically
 fix
 things,
 but
 like
 as
 soon


as
 you
 would
 touch
 something,
 something


else
 would
 break.
 Um
 so
 I
 got
 it
 I
 got


it
 somewhat
 stabilized
 and
 I
 told
 him


like,
 "Look,
 this
 is
 this
 is
 like


madness.
 Um
 I'm
 going
 to
 rewite
 this
 for


you."
 Yeah.
 But
 it
 took
 half
 a
 year.
 I'm


going
 to
 do
 it
 in
 in
 a
 month.
 Well,
 it


took
 me
 two
 months.
 Um,
 I
 wasn't
 that


far
 off


and
 and
 then
 here
 I
 was
 working
 on
 a
 on


a
 PDF
 viewer.
 You
 know,
 on
 every


technical
 problem,
 the
 domain
 is
 is
 I


wouldn't
 say
 like
 completely


unimportant,
 but
 you
 can
 always
 find


interesting
 problems
 in
 every
 domain.


And
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 interesting


problems
 because
 you
 had
 a
 C
 call
 that


would
 render
 a
 PDF
 that
 would
 maybe
 take


30
 megabytes,
 but
 the
 whole
 system
 had


64
 megabytes.
 So
 if
 you're
 not
 very


smart
 and
 like
 very
 careful
 what
 you
 do


in
 the
 background
 and
 when
 the
 OS
 would


just
 kill
 you.
 I
 got
 really
 fixated
 at


like
 making
 it
 good
 like
 when
 the


rotation
 is
 like
 that
 the
 page
 would


like
 animate
 and
 so
 so
 you
 know
 I
 I
 like


I
 like
 those
 details.
 I
 spent
 way
 too


much
 time
 on
 that.
 That's
 why
 I
 took
 two


months
 instead
 of
 one.
 But
 the
 end


result
 was
 it's
 good.
 Um
 and
 then
 I
 I
 I


worked
 with
 them
 for
 a
 while
 and
 then
 a


friend
 texted
 me
 up.
 He's
 like,
 "Yeah,


I'm
 working
 on
 this
 magazine
 app
 and


it's
 really
 hard."
 I'm
 like,
 "Yeah,
 no


way
 it's
 hard.
 I
 know."
 Oh,
 like
 I
 did


it.


>> You
 just
 built
 one.


>> And
 and
 he
 was
 like,
 "Can
 you
 can
 you


can
 you
 get
 me
 the
 code?"
 I'm
 like,


"Sure."
 So,
 I
 sold
 him
 like
 I
 extracted


the
 the
 part
 that
 was
 PDF
 from
 from
 this


magazine
 app.
 And
 I
 I
 made
 sure
 I
 made


sure
 like
 the
 other
 person
 was
 okay.
 And


then
 I
 sold
 him
 that.
 I
 was
 like,
 "Well,


if
 he's
 interested
 in
 that,
 why
 let's


not
 try
 to
 sell
 it
 to
 other
 people."
 I


used
 a
 a
 WordPress
 template
 and


mutilated
 it
 to
 run
 on
 GitHub
 pages
 and


then
 and
 then
 when
 you
 did
 the
 the
 fast


lane
 flow
 at
 the
 end
 you
 got
 a
 Dropbox


link
 to
 my
 personal
 Dropbox
 with
 a


source
 code
 sip
 and
 I
 put
 this
 on
 one


afternoon
 and
 I
 I
 tweeted
 it
 and
 and


then
 in
 that
 week
 three
 people
 bought
 it


and
 it
 was
 like
 I
 guess
 200
 bucks
 but


back
 then
 and
 for
 me
 this
 was
 like


amazing
 and
 not
 only
 I
 got
 like
 three


people
 who
 just
 bought
 it
 and
 like
 10


emails
 who
 comp
 10
 people
 who
 complained


about


uh
 because
 they
 wanted
 it
 but
 it
 didn't


have
 the
 features
 they
 wanted.
 You
 know,


it's
 like
 I
 got
 nerd
 sniped.
 I
 was
 like,


"Oh,
 I
 didn't
 have
 text
 selection."
 Oh,


how
 hard
 can
 it
 be?
 3
 months
 later.
 Oh,


yeah.
 It's
 really
 hard.


Text
 selection
 in
 a
 PDF
 specifically.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 You
 know
 the


saying
 the
 saying
 like
 uh
 the
 companies


are
 built
 by
 young
 people
 because
 they


don't
 know
 how
 hard
 it
 is.


>> Yes.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 had
 no
 idea
 what
 an
 insane


madness
 this
 file
 format
 is.
 Peter
 was


talking
 about
 how
 some
 problems
 look


deceptively
 simple.
 PDF
 rendering
 is
 a


good
 example.
 You
 look
 at
 it
 and
 think,


how
 hard
 could
 it
 be?
 And
 then
 you
 spend


months
 on
 edge
 cases
 that
 you
 didn't


even
 know
 existed.
 This
 looks
 easy
 until


you
 build
 it
 pattern
 shows
 up
 in
 other


places,
 too.
 Internal
 tooling
 for


feature
 flags
 and
 experimentation
 is
 a


classic
 example.
 Teams
 often


underestimate
 how
 much
 work
 it
 is
 to


build
 infrastructure
 around
 these
 tools.


There's
 a
 reason
 big
 tech
 companies
 like


Uber
 invested
 years
 into
 building


internal
 experimentation
 and
 feature


flagging
 systems.
 Which
 brings
 me
 to


Static,
 our
 presenting
 partner
 for
 the


season.
 Static
 gives
 you
 the
 complete


toolkit
 without
 building
 it
 yourself.


You
 get
 feature
 flags,
 experimentation,


and
 product
 analytics
 all
 in
 one


platform
 tied
 to
 the
 same
 underlying


user
 assignments
 and
 data.
 In
 practice,


it
 looks
 like
 this.
 You
 roll
 out
 a


change
 to
 1%
 of
 users
 first.
 You
 see
 how


it
 moves
 the
 top
 pipeline
 metrics
 you


care
 about,
 conversion,
 retention,


whatever
 is
 relevant
 for
 the
 release.
 If


something
 goes
 wrong,
 instant
 roll
 back.


If
 it's
 working,
 you
 can
 confidently


scale
 it
 up.
 Companies
 like
 Notion
 went


from
 singledigit
 experiments
 per
 quarter


to
 over
 300
 experiments
 with
 static.


They
 shipped
 over
 600
 features
 behind


feature
 flags,
 moving
 fast
 while


protecting
 against
 metrics
 regression.


Microsoft,
 Atlassian,
 and
 Brex
 use


static
 for
 the
 same
 reason.
 It's
 the


infrastructure
 that
 enables
 both
 speed


and
 reliability
 at
 scale.
 Static
 has
 a


generous
 free
 tier
 to
 get
 started
 and


pro
 pricricing
 for
 teams
 starts
 at
 $150


per
 month.

And
 now,
 let's
 get
 back
 to
 Peter
 and
 why


rendering
 PDFs
 was
 a
 surprisingly
 hard


problem.


But
 now,
 I
 remember
 there
 was
 a
 few


weeks
 ago
 someone
 emailed
 me.
 They
 did


something
 PDF
 and
 they
 wanted
 my
 help.


And
 I
 just
 wrote
 them
 like,
 I'm
 sorry,


like
 I
 I
 did
 my
 deed.
 I
 I
 know
 more


about
 PDF
 than
 any
 any
 sane
 human
 person


ever
 should
 know.
 And
 I
 went
 I
 went
 to


therapy.
 Good
 luck.


But
 that
 took
 off
 and
 and
 I
 just
 I
 while


I
 was
 waiting
 for
 my
 visa,
 I
 I
 worked
 on


this
 project
 and
 and
 it
 just
 kept
 on


more
 people
 kept
 on
 buying
 it.
 And
 you


know,
 it
 was
 like
 it
 was
 like
 summer.
 I


was
 I
 was
 like
 lying
 at
 the
 lake
 and
 got


another
 email
 that
 someone
 bought
 it
 for


600
 bucks,
 800
 bucks.
 I
 just
 up
 the


prices
 as
 it
 had
 more
 features.
 And
 by


the
 time
 I
 I
 went
 to
 San
 Francisco
 to


work
 at
 this
 company,
 it
 already
 made


more
 than
 what
 I
 made
 there.
 But
 my


whole
 life
 was
 I
 still
 I
 still
 thought


like
 I
 have
 to
 be
 there,
 you
 know.


>> So
 I
 I
 did
 it.
 And
 also
 interestingly
 at


this
 company,
 I
 had
 to


>> So
 what
 would
 you
 say
 that
 you
 moved
 to


San
 Francisco?


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 of
 course
 also
 it
 ended
 up


being
 something
 where
 I
 had
 to
 build


build
 something
 with
 my
 framework
 at


that
 company
 too.
 But
 you
 know
 startups


are
 not
 like
 8
 hours.
 They're
 a
 little


more.
 And
 my
 personal
 project
 was
 also
 a


little
 more.
 So
 my
 sleep
 was
 a
 little


less.
 And
 then
 eventually
 after
 3
 months


uh
 Sabine
 my
 manager
 came
 over
 and
 said


this
 Peter
 are
 you
 okay?
 And
 they
 gave


me
 a
 choice
 uh
 to
 either
 keep
 working
 at


this
 company
 and
 drop
 my
 project
 or
 or


vice
 versa.
 And
 I
 had
 one
 week
 to


decide.
 The
 counter
 was
 one
 week
 to


stay
 there
 or
 leave
 the
 country
 because


I
 was
 on
 a
 on
 a
 complicated
 visa.


And
 well,
 the
 decision
 was
 quite
 easy.


It's
 like,
 yeah,
 I
 want
 to
 do
 my
 own


thing.
 And
 then
 and


>> and
 at
 this
 point,
 it
 was
 already
 taking


off.
 You
 already
 saw
 that
 this
 is


there's
 a
 big
 business
 here.
 It
 it
 will


probably
 pay
 you
 as
 much
 as
 your
 US
 job


would
 have
 paid.
 Ah,


>> it
 was
 never
 money
 driven
 either.


>> It
 was
 more
 about
 what
 what
 were
 you


driven
 by?
 I
 want
 to
 make
 stuff
 that


other
 people
 find
 amazing.
 Like
 I
 I
 I


love
 tweaking
 the
 details.
 I
 love
 those


little
 delights.
 It
 wasn't
 even
 that
 the


space
 there
 were
 competitors
 in
 the


space.
 But
 my
 angle
 was
 always
 like
 I


built
 something
 as
 if
 Apple
 would
 have


built
 it
 like
 like
 with
 with
 like
 all


the
 love
 and
 care
 and
 and
 polish
 and
 and


those
 little
 delights
 that


a
 lot
 of
 people
 in
 the
 industry
 don't


get.
 Uh,
 so
 even
 though
 we
 had


competitors
 that
 had
 way
 more
 features


and
 were
 around
 way
 longer,
 my
 company


was
 more
 successful
 and
 my
 product
 was


more
 successful
 cuz
 developers
 tried
 the


the
 different
 ones
 and
 mine
 just
 felt


the
 best.
 I
 think
 software
 is
 all
 about


about
 how
 it
 feels
 much
 more
 so
 than
 the


than
 the
 feature
 set.
 Like
 why
 did
 we


buy
 Apple
 stuff?
 It
 has
 more
 features


than
 than
 Windows.
 Um,
 but
 it
 it
 feels


better.
 So,
 how
 did
 you
 go
 from
 like
 you


you
 left
 this
 company
 and
 you
 were


building
 this
 PDF
 component
 that
 started


to
 sell.
 At
 what
 point
 did
 you
 hire
 the


first
 person
 realizing,
 okay,
 there's


something
 more
 to
 this?
 when
 I
 went
 back


to
 Vienna
 then
 I
 was
 like
 okay
 I
 have
 to


go
 all
 in
 and
 that's
 where
 I
 I
 started


working
 with
 freelancers
 a
 little
 bit


and
 way
 too
 late
 to
 be
 honest
 also
 like


I
 I
 could
 have
 could
 have
 hired
 much


earlier
 but
 you
 know
 you
 know
 it's
 it's


it's
 a
 big
 step
 and
 that's
 kind
 of
 where


it
 it
 started
 having
 a
 life
 of
 its
 own


and
 I
 spent


pretty
 much
 13
 years
 of
 my
 career


um
 building
 this
 product
 with
 this
 weird


name
 that
 I
 never
 changed
 because
 I
 took


me
 like
 I
 thought
 like
 five
 minutes


about
 it
 and
 then
 stock
 PSPDF
 kit.


>> PSPDF.


>> They
 finally
 they
 finally
 did
 a
 rename,


but
 I
 wouldn't
 have
 I
 wouldn't
 have


renamed
 it.
 But
 now
 it
 it


>> it's
 it's
 a
 mouthful,
 but
 it's
 very


unique.


>> Well,
 you
 get
 it
 if
 you
 do
 Objective
 C


because
 it's
 just
 a
 name
 space.


>> Yes.


>> Um
 and
 by
 by
 the
 time
 it
 it
 made
 perfect


sense,
 my
 marketing
 my
 strategy
 for


marketing
 was
 always
 I
 only
 care
 about


the
 developer.
 Like
 I
 know
 like
 upper


management
 does
 the
 decisions
 but
 if
 I


can
 convince
 the
 people
 inside
 the


company
 they
 all
 do
 the
 marketing
 and


lobbying
 for
 me
 that
 worked
 really
 well.


We
 never
 did
 like
 cold
 cold
 emails
 or


aggressive.
 It
 was
 all
 inbound.
 All
 we


did
 was
 like
 make
 good
 stuff
 and
 write


insertful
 technical
 blog
 posts
 that
 and


I
 went
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 conferences
 like
 the


for
 me
 important
 it
 was
 okay
 if
 if


people
 understand
 that
 the
 people
 who


built
 this
 product
 are
 like
 know
 what


they
 do
 and
 and
 love
 what
 they
 do
 that


reflects
 on
 the
 product
 and
 that
 that


worked
 really
 well.


>> And
 then
 what
 was
 the
 text
 type
 behind


PSPDF
 kit?
 Was
 it
 objective
 C?
 Was
 it


later
 swift?
 Were
 there
 other


technologies
 like
 C
 or
 or
 anything
 else?


>> We
 eventually
 expanded
 to
 to
 all
 the


platforms.
 Um
 big
 shift
 was
 the
 switch


out
 renderer
 which
 was
 and
 is
 still


quite
 buggy
 to
 like
 a
 big
 C++
 one
 that


when
 then
 we
 used
 across
 all
 the


frameworks.
 Um
 we
 we
 were
 we
 were
 really


early
 with
 web.
 We
 were
 one
 of
 the
 first


PDF
 frameworks
 that
 ran
 in
 web
 assembly.


And
 I
 I
 did
 the
 most
 clever
 thing
 that


it
 was
 in
 the
 very
 early
 days
 when
 Web


Assembly
 was
 just
 taking
 off
 and
 we


built
 a
 benchmark
 and
 that
 benchmark
 was


eventually
 used
 by
 by
 Google
 and


Microsoft
 and
 Apple
 and
 I
 basically
 had


all
 these
 companies
 like
 working
 really


hard
 on
 making
 my
 renderer
 faster
 cuz


cuz
 they
 used
 their
 benchmark
 as
 one
 of


their
 benchmarks
 and
 the
 benchmark
 was


just
 like
 rendering
 our
 stuff
 with
 our


[ __ ]


>> Ah
 nice.
 And
 then
 a
 as
 as
 a
 company


grew,
 one
 thing
 that
 I
 remember
 about


PSPDF
 kit,
 you
 did
 write
 a
 lot
 of
 blogs


and
 one
 blog
 in
 2019,
 so
 this
 was
 about


like
 I
 think
 you
 know
 year
 nine
 or
 10
 in


the
 company.
 It
 was
 about
 how
 the
 team


worked
 and
 you
 you
 mentioned
 things


there
 like
 every
 feature
 starts
 with
 a


proposal.
 You
 mentioned
 that
 you
 are


conservative
 because
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 big


API
 that
 that
 people
 use.
 You
 want
 to
 be


careful
 things
 like
 the
 boy
 scout
 rule


such
 a
 factor.
 How
 how
 did
 you
 kind
 of


put
 together
 the
 the
 culture
 of
 of
 this


now
 this
 team
 which
 was
 now
 closer
 to
 30


or
 60
 people?


>> We
 were
 actually
 70
 when
 when
 I
 sold
 my


shares
 and
 now
 it's
 almost
 200.
 And
 I
 I


knew
 right
 from
 the
 get-
 go
 it's
 like


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 find
 the
 people
 that
 I


need
 in
 Vienna.
 So
 it
 was
 always
 just


like
 remote
 first
 and
 eventually
 we
 we


landed
 up
 with
 some
 kind
 of
 hybrid
 model


uh
 which
 made
 things
 a
 bit
 more


complicated.
 I
 learned
 a
 whole
 lot
 on


the
 go.
 Like
 I
 I
 never
 had
 the
 urge
 to


be
 CEO.
 I
 always
 was
 coding.
 I
 I
 brought


people
 in
 to
 people
 that
 that
 helped
 me


a
 lot
 with
 other
 other
 parts.
 Uh
 and
 on


the
 business
 side,
 I
 can
 do
 it
 and
 I
 I


think
 I
 think
 I'm
 I'm
 quite
 good
 at
 it,


but
 I
 just
 don't
 enjoy
 it.
 Like
 even
 on


sales
 calls
 where
 you
 like
 have
 to
 like


think
 of
 all
 the
 magic
 number
 how
 much


it
 would
 be
 worth
 because
 that's
 how


enterprise
 works.
 Gh
 worse.
 Peter
 just


said,
 "Ah,
 the
 worst
 about
 enterprise


sales.
 Because
 selling
 to
 large


companies,
 enterprises,
 is
 as
 tricky
 as


it
 gets."
 Not
 just
 because
 you
 need
 to


get
 pricing
 right,
 but
 because
 of
 all


the
 enterprise
 features
 that
 you
 need
 to


build.
 And
 this
 leads
 us
 nicely
 to
 our


season
 sponsor,
 Work
 OS.
 If
 you're


building
 with
 AI
 agents
 or
 automation


tools,
 here's
 a
 problem
 most
 teams
 don't


think
 about
 at
 first.
 Once
 an
 agent
 can


take
 actions
 on
 your
 behalf,
 you
 need
 to


control
 what
 it's
 allowed
 to
 do.
 And


traditional
 O
 just
 wasn't
 designed
 for


that.
 That's
 why
 work
 introduced
 MCP
 off


which
 gives
 teams
 a
 way
 to
 authenticate


AI
 agents
 with
 explicit
 permissions


auditability
 and
 enterprisegrade


security.
 Instead
 of
 sharing
 over
 scoped


API
 keys,
 you
 can
 define
 clear


boundaries
 for
 the
 data
 that
 agents
 can


access
 and
 the
 agents
 they
 can
 perform.


If
 you're
 building
 AI
 powered
 features


and
 want
 to
 share
 fast
 without


compromising
 security,
 check
 out


workeros.com/mcp.


And
 with
 this,
 let's
 get
 back
 to
 Peter


and
 enterprise
 pricing.
 But
 that's
 also


the
 only
 thing
 that
 that
 really
 works
 on


on
 a
 model
 like
 this.


>> Yeah.
 You
 mean
 enterprise
 sales


specifically,
 right?


>> Meaning
 custom
 pricing.
 So
 So
 can
 you


tell
 us
 for
 for
 for
 you
 know
 devs


listening
 who
 go
 to
 a
 vendor's
 website


and
 they're
 frustrated
 that
 there's
 no


price.
 It
 says
 call
 us
 or
 schedule


meeting.
 Why
 that
 is?


>> Oh,
 that's
 that's
 why
 because
 we
 going


to
 look
 at
 your
 company
 and
 then
 just


take
 the
 dice
 and
 and
 and
 think
 about


the
 number
 that
 you're
 probably
 willing


to
 pay.
 And
 that
 sounds
 horrible.
 But


also
 when
 you
 have
 a
 product
 where
 you


can't
 really
 tear
 it
 down
 to
 a
 specific


number
 like
 it
 it's
 it
 makes
 a


difference
 if
 uh
 a
 freelancer
 contacts


us
 or
 one
 of
 the
 big
 Fortune
 500s.
 Let's


not
 say
 names


>> because
 the
 usage
 will
 be
 different.
 The


value
 they
 get
 out
 of
 it
 will
 be


different
 and
 charging
 the
 same.
 You


would
 either
 exclude
 one
 or
 the
 other.


If
 I
 if
 I
 if
 I
 go
 too
 low,
 they're
 going


to
 see
 this
 fishy.
 It's
 like
 uh


procurement
 for
 like
 500
 bucks.
 we're


not
 going
 to
 even
 start
 the
 process.
 And


if
 we
 we
 target
 it
 too
 high,
 we're
 going


to
 lose
 those
 people.
 So So
 as
 horrible


and
 unfair
 this
 process
 seems
 for
 some


kinds
 of
 products,
 it
 is
 the
 it's
 the


most
 fair
 way
 after
 all.
 You
 know,
 you


know,
 on
 software


there
 is
 I
 would
 say
 there's
 like
 four


axes.
 There's
 like
 easy
 and
 hard
 and


interesting
 and
 not
 interesting.
 We
 were


very
 much
 in
 the
 not
 interesting
 and


hard
 part.
 If
 you
 build
 something
 that


every
 developer
 wants
 to
 build,
 it's


going
 to
 be
 a
 hard
 cell.
 It's
 it's
 a


hard
 sell
 anyhow.
 Selling
 anything
 to


developers
 is
 a
 hard
 sell.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 if
 it's
 if
 it's
 too
 easy
 or
 too


interesting,
 good
 luck.
 But
 if
 it's


>> oh
 god,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 this
 and
 oh


my
 god,
 this
 is
 hard.
 That's
 a
 good
 spot


to
 be
 in.
 So
 So
 I
 found
 a
 really


interesting
 niche
 and
 there
 were
 just
 an


infinite
 number
 of
 complex
 problems.


>> You
 you
 you
 need
 to
 tell
 me
 tell
 me
 one


or
 two
 hard
 things
 about
 parsing
 PDF.


How
 hard
 could
 it
 be?
 There's
 a


specification.
 I'm
 an
 engineer.
 I
 know


specifications.
 I
 What's
 so
 hard
 about


it?


>> I
 mean,
 there
 was
 this
 one
 example


where,
 you
 know,
 like
 PDF
 has
 have


links.
 So,
 like
 there's
 like
 there's


like
 a
 table
 of
 contents
 and
 you
 click


on
 it
 and
 it
 goes
 to
 like
 page
 37.
 So,
 I


built
 this
 whole
 model
 with
 the


assumption,
 oh
 yeah,
 maybe
 there's
 like


a
 100
 or
 400
 links
 in
 there.


>> And
 then
 we
 got
 this
 one
 customer
 who


like
 paid
 really
 good
 money.
 And
 then
 I


was
 like,
 oh,
 it
 takes
 4
 minutes
 to
 load


a
 PDF.
 What
 the
 heck,
 guys?
 And
 I
 looked


at
 it
 and
 it
 was
 like
 a
 50,000
 page
 text


bible
 from
 Canada
 and
 it
 had


>> 50,000
 pages.


>> It
 had
 like
 more
 than
 100
 links
 per


page,


>> 500,000
 links.


>> My
 data
 model
 completely
 exploded


because
 my
 assumptions
 were
 off
 by
 a


number
 of
 what
 1,000.
 But
 by
 then
 you


have
 like
 a
 mature
 product
 with
 an
 API.


So
 like
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 completely


redesign
 the
 internal
 part
 without


breaking
 things
 for
 everyone?
 like


suddenly
 everything
 has
 to
 be
 lazy
 where


where
 before
 parsing
 100
 one
 was
 easy


but
 now
 they
 were
 like
 this
 was
 like
 so


difficult
 to
 keep
 it
 working
 for
 people


um
 I
 think
 I
 spent
 like
 two
 months
 just


on
 that
 completely
 redesigning
 like
 the


internals
 and
 like
 making
 sure
 it's


still
 easy
 for
 people
 they
 don't
 have
 to


know
 what
 we
 what
 we
 load
 easy
 what
 we


load
 lazy
 or
 if
 you
 copy
 this
 thing
 it


it
 still
 has
 to
 like
 have
 to
 keep
 some


connection


>> it
 needs
 to
 keep
 the
 references
 and
 and


some
 of
 those
 things.


>> So,
 so
 I
 and
 I
 I
 love
 to
 do
 support
 and


I
 think
 that
 that
 that
 also
 a
 confining


factor
 why
 the
 company
 worked
 cuz
 if
 if


you
 send
 a
 ticket
 and
 then
 the
 the
 the


CEO
 replies
 and
 helps
 you
 out


um
 that
 has
 impact
 and
 my
 my
 strategy


was
 always
 like
 I
 always
 used
 to
 list
 in


reverse
 cuz
 if
 you
 if
 you
 send
 a
 ticket


and
 you
 get
 a
 reply
 within
 5
 minute


that's
 magical.
 If
 you
 wait
 one
 or
 two


days
 not
 much
 difference.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 yeah,
 this
 this
 was
 one
 of
 the


problems
 where
 I
 worked
 two
 months
 and
 I


finally
 got
 it
 down
 to
 almost
 like
 this.


>> Mhm.
 That
 must
 have
 been
 satisfying.


>> And
 and
 it
 was
 this
 was
 very
 satisfying.


>> And
 you
 were
 writing
 a
 lot
 a
 lot
 of
 the


code
 or
 you
 were
 involved
 in
 in
 in
 a


bunch
 of
 the
 code
 like
 obviously
 a
 big


big
 team
 was
 now
 here,
 but
 you
 were


still
 kind
 of
 overseeing
 it,
 right?


You're
 in
 the
 details.
 I
 mean,
 of


course,
 I
 had
 a
 a
 really
 great
 team
 and


and
 some
 parts
 I
 was
 more
 involved.
 I


was
 always
 more
 involved
 in
 mobile


because
 that's
 where
 my
 my
 heart
 was,


but
 I
 was
 always
 very
 deep
 in
 the
 tech


and
 and
 the the


marketing
 side,
 the
 business
 side.
 I
 had


like
 Jonathan's
 help,
 I
 had
 marketing


help.
 There
 was
 I
 I
 I
 found
 good
 people.


The
 the
 thing
 is
 if
 you
 like
 the


blogging
 and
 writing
 about
 how
 you
 solve


interesting
 hard
 problems
 will
 help
 you


hire
 interesting
 people
 that
 want
 to


solve
 interesting
 problems.
 This
 is
 what


I
 remember
 at
 PSP
 PDF
 kit
 that
 your
 blog


was
 every
 now
 and
 then
 it
 admitted
 it
 to


hacker
 news
 as
 well
 but
 it
 was
 just


interesting
 to
 read
 and
 I
 couldn't
 name


again
 I
 I'm
 not
 went
 into
 PDFs
 but
 if
 I


had
 to
 say
 something
 a
 PDF
 I
 would
 have


said
 PSPDF
 kit
 because
 they're
 the
 only


ones
 where
 I
 read
 interesting
 engineing


blogs
 about
 how
 you
 optimize
 your
 ship


is
 still
 there
 by
 the
 way
 I
 I
 I
 myself


also
 sometimes
 ask
 myself
 like
 hm


interesting
 do
 more
 companies
 not
 see


this
 or
 is
 is
 the
 question
 that
 you
 you


need
 to
 be
 a
 developer
 who's
 either
 the


CEO
 or
 or
 up
 there
 who
 just
 likes
 doing


this.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 did
 did
 you
 ever


write
 this
 thinking
 this
 will
 be
 helpful


or
 you
 just
 wrote
 because
 you
 got


something
 out
 of
 it
 like
 putting
 out


that
 you
 solved
 this
 hard
 problem?


>> I
 like
 sharing
 and
 and
 and
 like


inspiring
 people.
 Um
 there
 was
 sometimes


even
 conflicts
 where
 we
 were
 like
 should


we
 write
 about
 this
 because
 it's
 like
 a


little
 bit
 of
 secret
 sauce


but
 I
 just
 never
 listen
 to
 those
 voices


too
 much.
 Um
 I
 just
 you
 know
 there's


also
 like
 when
 you
 when
 you
 write


something
 down
 there
 it's
 this
 principle


of
 like
 you
 understand
 it
 but
 then
 if


you
 want
 to
 teach
 it
 you
 really
 have
 to


understand
 it.
 So
 to
 to
 me
 it
 was
 also
 a


little
 bit
 like
 oh
 yeah
 I
 worked
 on
 this


really
 hard
 problem
 and
 now
 I
 want
 to


like
 preserve
 it
 and
 like
 help
 others.


So,
 so,
 so
 I
 I
 got
 I
 got
 a
 gig
 of
 it
 of


of
 course
 I
 liked
 the
 attention.
 Um,
 but


really
 it
 it
 was
 this


sometimes
 I
 just
 referenced
 a
 year
 later


to
 my
 own
 post
 like
 yeah
 this
 this
 is
 a


this
 is
 both
 company
 documentation.
 This


is
 like
 my
 own
 lookbook.
 It's
 helpful
 on


so
 many
 ways
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 bigger


companies.


Oh,
 they
 put
 on
 too
 much
 red
 tape.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 developers
 who
 don't


really
 like
 to
 write.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 forced


everyone
 once
 a
 month
 a
 full
 day
 just
 to


write
 a
 blog
 post.


>> But
 you
 gave
 them
 the
 time.
 You're
 like


that
 day
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 do
 any
 other


work
 but
 write
 something.


>> Yeah.
 You
 have
 Yeah.
 You
 have
 a
 day
 to


come
 up
 with
 a
 post.
 Ah
 a
 day
 is
 is


quite
 much
 actually.
 I
 mean
 when
 I'm


nowadays
 when
 I
 write
 posts
 it
 still


takes
 me


a
 few
 hours.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 dwell
 too


much
 on
 like
 the
 I
 think
 the
 the
 the


starting
 time
 of
 the
 company
 is
 the
 most


interesting.
 the
 then
 the
 the
 growth


phase,
 you
 get
 more
 red
 tape,
 you
 get


more
 people.
 It's
 much
 more
 gardening


your
 product
 instead
 of
 like
 doing
 doing


wild
 hacks


>> um
 and
 more
 iterative.
 So,
 so,
 so
 it
 got


a
 little
 bit
 less
 interesting
 uh
 over


the
 years
 and
 there
 was
 like
 more
 people


drama
 cuz
 the
 more
 so
 the
 more
 people


you
 have,
 the
 more
 issues
 there
 are
 and


I
 didn't
 enjoy
 it
 that
 much
 and
 I
 was


really
 really
 burned
 out.
 What
 what


burnt
 you
 out,
 do
 you
 think?


>> I
 was
 just
 burning
 too
 hard.
 I
 was


working
 most
 weekends.
 I
 I
 I
 tried
 to


shuffle
 all
 my
 managerial
 needs.
 And
 you


know,
 as
 a
 CEO,
 you're
 basically
 the


waste
 bin
 cuz
 everything
 everything
 that


other
 people
 don't
 manage
 or
 or
 can
 do


or
 or
 mess
 up,
 you
 have
 to
 fix.
 And
 it's


also
 quite
 lonely
 because
 you
 you
 can't


openly
 talk
 about
 a
 lot
 of
 things.
 I


mean
 I
 I
 I
 I
 structured
 the
 company
 to


be
 quite
 open
 but
 still
 like
 you
 cannot


you
 cannot
 be
 negative.
 You
 have
 to
 even


if
 even
 if
 like
 even
 if
 like
 really
 bad


stuff
 happens.
 I
 know
 there
 was
 like


there
 was
 like
 one
 weekend
 where
 my
 my


co-founder
 called
 me
 at
 at
 5:00
 a.m.
 and


told
 me
 like
 yeah
 there's
 this
 big


airplane
 company
 and
 their
 planes
 are


down
 because
 our
 software
 is
 crashing.


That
 was
 a
 very
 interesting
 weekend


until
 I
 could
 like
 I
 disassembled
 their


their
 app
 and
 did
 proof
 that
 they
 messed


around
 with
 our
 source
 code
 to


triggering
 a
 triggering
 a
 license
 key


fall
 back.
 Uh
 that
 eventually
 like


caused
 issue
 they
 had.
 But
 that
 was
 like


a
 if
 they
 sus
 company's
 gone
 and
 more


moment.
 Um
 and
 that's
 just
 on
 top
 to
 all


the
 additional
 stress
 and
 there
 were


quite
 a
 few
 of
 those
 things.
 You
 can
 do


that
 for
 a
 while.
 And
 I
 I
 also
 believe


like
 burnout
 doesn't
 necessarily
 come


from
 working
 too
 much.
 It
 it
 comes
 more


from
 or
 at least
 for
 me
 when
 you
 when


you
 work
 on
 something
 but
 you
 don't


believe
 in
 it
 anymore
 or
 you
 have
 like


too
 many
 conflicts
 and
 and
 we
 also
 had
 a


we
 did
 fight
 a
 lot
 in
 the
 team
 uh
 with


like
 management
 team
 and
 by
 the
 time
 I
 I


made
 this
 mistake
 and
 I
 thought
 you
 have


to
 like
 lead
 a
 company
 more


democratically.


Um
 so
 that
 was
 also
 something
 that


burned
 me
 out.
 I
 wouldn't
 I
 wouldn't


want
 to
 miss
 it
 for
 a
 while,
 though.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 you
 know,
 from
 from
 the


outside,
 it
 seems
 you
 sold
 your
 shares,


you
 made
 enough
 money
 to
 not
 have
 to


work
 again,
 should
 you
 not
 choose.
 And


for
 a
 lot
 of
 people,
 like,
 you
 know,


people
 who
 are
 starting
 out
 their


business
 or
 or
 one
 day
 want
 to
 start
 a


business,
 this
 sounds
 like
 the
 absolute


dream.
 Like,
 this
 is
 I
 guess
 what
 we


know
 realistically
 that
 most
 people
 will


not
 make
 it,
 but
 if
 you
 make
 it,
 I
 mean,


you've
 kind
 of
 like
 I
 guess
 you
 know,


checkbox
 done.
 You're
 kind
 of
 it's
 a


little
 bit
 if
 you're
 like
 climbing
 on
 a


wall
 and
 you
 ring
 the
 bell,
 you're
 done.


And
 then
 what
 I
 noticed
 is
 from
 the


outside
 again
 on
 your
 blog,
 the
 blog


post
 completely
 stopped
 for
 several


years.
 What
 what
 did
 you
 do
 uh
 in
 in


this
 time
 uh
 and
 and
 what
 what what
 did


you
 learn
 in
 this
 time,
 you
 know,
 before


you
 came
 back
 to
 to
 where
 we
 are
 now?


>> I
 needed
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 to
 decompress.
 I


I
 catched
 up
 a
 lot
 on
 the
 things
 I


thought
 I
 missed.
 I
 I
 a
 lot.
 Um
 there


were
 months
 where
 I
 didn't
 even
 turn
 on


my
 computer.
 And
 for
 a
 while
 I
 was
 I


just
 didn't
 had
 this
 feeling
 of
 like


what
 should
 I
 do
 now?
 Like
 like
 I


definitely
 was
 like


why
 border?
 You
 know,
 you're
 not
 you're


not
 supposed
 to
 to
 retire
 so
 early
 or


like
 have
 so
 much
 have
 such
 a
 good
 exit


that
 you
 never
 have
 to
 work
 again.
 That


messed
 with
 my
 mind
 quite
 a
 bit.
 That


>> that
 was
 some
 that
 was
 some
 hard
 years.


And
 then
 in
 in
 April
 I
 was
 like


I
 there
 was
 this
 idea
 that
 I
 had
 years


ago
 and
 even
 a
 side
 project
 that
 I


started
 I
 was
 like
 oh
 yeah
 I
 want
 to
 I


want
 to
 continue
 on
 that
 and
 then
 after


after
 after
 more
 than
 3
 years
 I
 just
 sat


back
 to
 my
 computer
 and
 and
 started


hacking
 again.
 But
 the
 thing
 was
 this


was
 like
 a
 a
 Twitter
 analytics
 thing
 and


it
 was
 written
 in
 in
 Swift
 and
 Swift
 UI


and
 back
 then
 I
 already
 knew
 this
 would


have
 would
 be
 so
 much
 better
 if
 I
 would


build
 as
 a
 website.


>> So
 So
 was
 this
 an
 existing
 idea
 that
 you


kind
 of
 had
 at
 the
 back
 of
 your
 your


mind
 something
 something
 Twitter


analytic?


>> Yeah,
 it
 was
 just
 like
 something
 I


wanted
 to
 build
 for
 myself
 because
 uh


because
 it
 didn't
 exist
 and
 then


>> even
 three
 years
 later
 it
 didn't
 exist.


It
 still
 doesn't
 exist.
 Uh
 it
 it
 kind
 of


does
 but
 I
 got
 a
 bit
 sidetracked.
 So
 I
 I


went
 back
 and
 I
 I
 wanted
 to
 build
 it
 in


in
 with
 web
 tech.
 But
 web
 was
 really
 was


always
 even
 at
 the
 company
 the
 one
 thing


that
 I
 looked
 into
 the
 least
 because
 I


had
 I
 had
 someone
 really
 smart
 who
 took


care
 of
 of
 of
 that
 side
 in
 the
 company


that
 I
 brought
 in
 Martin.
 So
 I
 never
 had


to
 worry
 about
 it.
 That
 was
 one
 of
 the


>> You're
 not
 hands
 on
 with
 React
 or
 any
 of


that
 stuff.


>> Yeah.
 And
 when
 I
 came
 back,
 I
 was
 like,


what's
 a
 prop?
 You
 know,
 that
 that
 level


where
 you
 really
 where
 and
 you
 know,


this
 is
 like
 this
 is
 a
 a
 trap
 I
 see
 with


many
 developers.
 The
 the
 better
 you
 get


at
 one
 technology,
 the
 harder
 it
 is
 to


jump
 somewhere
 else.
 It's
 not
 that
 you


can't
 do
 it,
 but
 it
 hurts
 so
 much.


You're
 like
 like
 I
 can
 I
 can
 program
 in


in in in
 Apple
 stack.
 and
 program
 blind.


But
 then
 in
 that
 stack,
 I
 have
 to
 Google


the
 most
 mundane
 stuff
 and
 it
 it
 just


like
 it
 just
 hurts.
 You
 you
 you
 feel
 you


feel
 like
 an
 idiot
 again.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 I
 guess
 the
 more


experience
 you
 have,
 it
 it
 kind
 of
 sucks


feeling.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 sure
 you
 say


embrace
 and
 and
 all
 that,
 but
 it's
 it's


not
 great.
 You're
 not
 as
 efficient.
 You


know
 that
 you
 could
 be
 faster,
 etc.


>> Yeah.
 So
 So
 I
 came
 back
 and
 I
 was
 like,


gosh,
 there
 has
 to
 be
 there
 has
 to
 be


what
 is
 this
 AI?
 What
 is
 this
 AI
 stuff


that
 every
 that
 that
 people
 are


dismissing?
 let's
 look
 into
 this.
 Yeah.


And
 in
 April,
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 were
 the


specific
 probably
 for
 rightfully
 so,
 but


and
 I
 and
 I
 and
 I
 like
 and
 I
 to
 a
 degree


I
 I
 credit
 those
 three
 years
 where
 I


basically
 didn't
 turn
 on
 my
 computer


because
 in
 those
 years
 you
 guys
 checked


out
 AI
 and
 learned
 that
 it's
 crap.


>> Yeah.
 the
 the
 people
 who
 like
 I
 was


about
 to
 say
 so
 you
 missed
 out
 on
 you


didn't
 do
 the
 beta
 of
 GitHub
 copilot
 you


know
 glorified
 autocomplete
 which
 is


GPC3
 or
 or
 maybe
 not
 even
 there
 was
 then


of
 course
 3.5
 which
 is
 a
 big
 jump
 and
 it


it
 got
 incrementally
 better
 than
 GPT4


and
 so
 by
 the
 time
 you
 came
 back
 what


tool
 did
 you
 first
 use
 when
 you
 cuz
 you


missed
 out
 on
 like
 two
 years
 of
 like


like
 devs
 us
 devs
 using
 dismissing


finding
 some
 niche
 use
 cases
 for
 it


>> oh
 cloud
 code
 so
 you
 start
 with
 cloud


mode
 that
 I
 think
 came
 out.


>> It
 just
 came
 out
 It
 came
 out
 in
 May,
 but


there
 was
 a
 beta
 beforehand.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 think
 they
 had
 something


Didn't
 they
 have
 something
 in
 February


already?


>> They
 had
 a
 beta
 from
 February.
 Correct.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 so


>> so
 clock
 was
 your
 first
 you
 you
 come


back
 after
 like
 a
 you
 know
 hiatus
 and


you
 immediately
 turned
 on
 clock
 code
 and


you
 missed
 everything
 else
 before.
 and


and and
 you
 know,
 you
 know,
 it
 was
 like


I
 I
 remember
 I
 took
 this
 big
 messy
 site


project
 that
 I
 built
 and
 I
 have
 this


browser
 extension
 where
 that
 that


converts
 a
 GitHub
 repository
 into
 one


big
 markdown
 that
 was
 like
 a
 1.3


megabyte
 markdown
 file
 and
 I
 dragged
 it


into
 into
 Google's
 CI
 studio
 with


Geminina
 2.5
 or
 two
 to
 something
 and
 I


typed
 write
 me
 a
 spec
 and
 it
 generated


those
 400
 lines
 of
 spec
 And
 I
 dragged


this
 back
 into
 cloud
 code


and
 I
 was
 like
 build
 and
 then
 I
 continue


continue
 continue
 and
 while
 I
 was
 like


working
 on
 other
 stuff,
 you
 know,
 um
 and


eventually
 told
 me
 like
 it's
 100%


production
 ready
 and
 I
 started
 it
 and
 it


crashed.
 I'm
 sure
 we
 can
 all
 relate
 to


the
 story
 of
 the
 AI
 saying
 the
 code
 is


production
 ready
 then
 crashing.
 This
 is


a
 pretty
 funny
 and
 innocent
 story,
 but
 I


personally
 don't
 trust
 code
 that
 AI


generates
 without
 verifying
 it.
 And
 this


leads
 us
 nicely
 to
 our
 season
 sponsor,


Sonar.
 So,
 let's
 look
 at
 some
 data.
 A


new
 report
 from
 Sonar,
 the
 state
 of
 code


developer
 survey
 report,
 found
 that
 82%


of
 developers
 believe
 they
 can
 code


faster
 with
 AI.
 But
 here's
 what's


interesting.
 In
 the
 same
 survey,
 96%
 of


developers
 said
 they
 do
 not
 highly
 trust


the
 accuracy
 of
 AI
 code.
 This
 checks
 out


for
 me
 as
 well.
 While
 I
 write
 the
 code


faster
 with
 AI
 agents,
 I
 don't
 exactly


trust
 the
 code
 it
 produces.
 This
 really


becomes
 a
 problem
 at
 the
 code
 review


stage
 where
 all
 this
 AI
 generated
 code


must
 be
 regularly
 verified
 for
 security,


reliability,
 and
 maintainability.
 Sonar


cube
 is
 precisely
 built
 to
 solve
 this


code
 verification
 issue.
 Sonar
 has
 been


the
 leader
 in
 the
 automated
 code


analysis
 business
 for
 over
 17
 years,


analyzing
 750
 billion
 lines
 of
 code


daily.
 That's
 over
 8
 million
 lines
 of


code
 per
 second.
 I
 actually
 first
 came


across
 Sonar
 13
 years
 ago
 in
 2013
 when
 I


was
 working
 at
 Microsoft
 Skype
 and
 a


bunch
 of
 teams
 already
 use
 Sonar
 Cube
 to


improve
 the
 quality
 of
 their
 code.
 I've


been
 a
 fan
 since.
 Sonar
 provides
 an


essential
 and
 independent
 verification


layer.
 It's
 the
 automated
 guardrail
 that


analyzes
 all
 code
 whether
 it's
 developer


or
 AI
 agent
 generated,
 ensuring
 it
 meets


your
 quality
 and
 security
 standards


before
 it
 ever
 reaches
 production.

With
 this,
 let's
 get
 back
 to
 Peter
 and


how
 AI
 agents
 cannot
 exactly
 be
 trusted.


>> Then
 I
 had
 then
 I
 added
 added
 an
 MCP
 so


it
 could
 use
 the
 browser.
 I
 think
 the


player
 with
 MCP
 was
 already
 there
 and
 it


looped
 a
 few
 more
 hours
 and
 then
 I
 had
 a


I
 had
 a
 Twitter
 login
 page
 and
 it
 it
 did


something.
 I
 It
 was
 not
 great,
 but
 it


did
 something.
 And
 to
 me
 to
 me
 this
 was


my
 holy
 [ __ ]
 mind-blowing
 moment.


>> Yeah.


>> This
 and
 this
 was
 like
 in
 April
 or
 May


this
 year,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 It
 was
 it
 was
 it
 was
 just
 good


enough
 that
 I
 could
 see
 the
 potential


and
 I
 I
 understood
 it's
 like


>> yeah
 this
 is
 this
 is
 where
 it's
 going


and
 and
 from
 that
 moment
 on
 I
 I
 had
 a


few
 months
 where
 I
 had
 really
 trouble


sleeping
 and
 I
 in


>> I
 I
 remember
 because
 once
 on
 Twitter
 I


sent
 you
 a
 direct
 message.
 I
 was
 up


early
 for
 valid
 reasons,
 you
 know,
 my
 my


kids
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 But
 it
 was


5:00
 a.m.
 and
 I
 I
 sent
 you
 a
 message
 on


Twitter
 and
 you
 replied
 immediately.
 And


I
 was
 like,
 "Why
 are
 you
 up?"
 And
 he's


like, "Oh,
 this
 is
 usual.
 Like
 I
 I


usually
 I'm
 still
 usually
 awake."
 And


and
 I
 asked
 like,
 "Why?"
 And
 you
 said


like,
 "Oh,
 I'm
 I'm
 just
 like
 using


Claude
 and
 it's
 really
 really


addictive."
 And
 I
 was
 like, "Really?"


And
 you're
 like,
 "Yeah,
 I'm
 not
 joking.


Like
 it's
 really
 good."
 And
 I
 think
 that


was
 the
 thing.
 You
 said
 something
 or


wrote
 something
 like
 just
 one
 more


prompt.
 like
 you
 told
 me
 how
 like
 what


what
 made
 it
 so
 addictive
 or
 or
 what


what
 still
 makes
 it
 so
 addictive?


>> Oh,
 it's
 the
 same
 economics
 as
 as
 you
 go


to
 a
 casino.
 That's
 that's
 it's
 my


little
 slot
 machines,
 you
 know?
 You
 you


you
 press
 the
 trigger
 and
 ding
 ding
 ding


ding
 ding
 and
 it's
 like
 nope.
 you
 you


type
 in
 the
 prompt
 and
 it
 it
 will
 like


and
 it
 does
 it
 does
 crap
 or
 it
 does


something
 that
 actually
 blows
 your
 mind


and
 it's
 this


>> and
 and
 you're
 saying
 it
 it
 blows
 your


mind
 as
 like
 you're
 a
 really
 experienced


developer
 like
 it's
 it's
 not
 easy
 to


blow
 your
 mind,
 right?
 Like
 you
 you


you've
 seen
 good
 code
 you
 can


differentiate
 like
 crap
 code,
 decent


code,
 good
 enough
 code
 like
 you
 have
 a


bar,
 right?
 It's
 so
 funny,
 you
 know,
 in


my
 company,
 I
 used
 to
 obsess
 over
 every


detail,
 every
 spacing,
 every
 new
 line,


the
 naming.
 I
 spend
 so
 much
 time
 bike


shedding.
 And
 in
 retrospect,
 I'm
 like,


what
 the
 heck?
 Why
 did
 I
 do
 that?
 Like,


what's
 the
 point
 that
 the
 customer


doesn't
 see
 the
 insights
 of
 of
 course


like
 it
 has
 to
 meet
 certain
 certain


standards.
 It
 has
 to
 work.
 It
 has
 to
 be


fast.
 It
 should
 be
 secure,
 but
 like
 how


much
 did
 that
 bike
 [ __ ]
 there
 is
 like


stupid.


>> You
 say
 that,
 but
 then
 you
 also
 just


said
 that
 people
 loved
 PSPDF
 kit
 because


it
 was
 the
 most
 polished.
 It
 worked
 the


best.
 Do
 you
 not
 think
 that
 that
 that


amount
 of
 caring
 bike
 shedding
 as
 you


call
 it?
 Being
 obsessed.
 It
 sound
 like


you
 were
 keeping
 tech
 depth
 at
 bay,
 you


know,
 like
 being
 obsessed
 with
 white


spaces
 is
 is
 not
 going to
 be
 messy.
 And


we
 know
 it's
 not
 just
 the
 white
 spaces.


we
 know
 you're
 going
 to
 care
 about


testing
 and
 all
 that.
 Like
 it
 sounds
 to


me
 that
 PSPDF
 kit
 like
 you
 know
 like


what
 I
 see
 is
 you
 were
 not
 just
 building


a
 product
 that
 was
 great
 UX
 but
 you


built
 something
 that
 had
 a
 really
 good


hygiene
 and
 that's
 how
 it
 could
 be
 high


performance
 and
 all
 that
 is
 how
 do
 you


think
 about
 it?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 To
 a
 degree.
 Yes.
 And


and
 even
 now
 like
 I
 I
 I
 mean
 like
 my
 my


last
 blog
 post
 was
 a
 confession
 that
 I
 I


ship
 code
 on
 read
 and


>> yeah
 we
 have
 to
 talk
 about
 that


>> and
 at
 the
 same
 time
 I
 spent
 so
 much


time
 to
 like
 restructuring


I
 mean
 I
 mean
 like
 even
 even
 today
 like


I
 I
 really
 wanted
 to
 get
 this
 PR
 in


where
 it
 was
 like
 15,000
 line
 change


where
 in
 my
 I
 moved
 everything
 over
 to
 a


plug-in
 architecture
 where
 I
 was
 so


excited
 about
 and
 I
 care
 a
 lot
 about
 the


structure.
 Did
 I
 read
 all
 the
 code?
 No,


because
 a
 lot
 of
 code
 really
 is
 just


boring
 plumbing.
 Well,
 what
 are
 most


apps?
 Like
 data
 comes
 in
 from
 an
 API
 in


one
 form.
 You
 like
 you
 parse
 it,
 you


package
 into
 a
 different
 form.
 Hey,
 you


store
 it
 into
 database
 and
 it's
 a


different
 form.
 It
 comes
 out
 again
 into


a
 different
 form.
 Then
 it's
 like
 HTML
 or


whatever.
 And
 you
 type
 in
 something
 it's


a
 different
 form
 again.
 And
 all
 you
 do


is
 like
 you're
 massaging
 data
 in


different
 forms
 throughout
 your
 app.


This
 is
 what
 most
 apps
 are.
 We
 are


pretty
 chasing
 printers.
 And
 the
 and
 the


the
 really
 the
 hard
 part
 is
 solved
 by


Postgress
 30
 years
 ago
 by
 some
 neck


birds.
 Uh
 that's
 that's
 really
 what
 a


lot
 of
 software
 is
 like.
 There's
 always


some
 interesting
 parts,
 but
 I
 don't
 have


to
 care
 how
 this
 button
 is
 aligned
 or


which
 tailwind
 class
 is
 used
 or
 or
 like


many
 details
 are
 boring
 and
 many
 other


details
 are
 interesting.
 But
 it
 I
 think


it's
 much
 more
 about
 system
 architecture


than
 having
 to
 read
 every
 single
 line.


>> Right
 now
 jumping
 forward,
 what
 is
 your


workflow
 like?
 Like like
 when
 you're


working
 on
 on
 cloud
 bot,
 are
 you
 using
 a


terminal,
 multiple
 terminals,
 which


which
 tools
 and
 and
 how
 are
 you
 you
 know


like
 you
 said
 you're
 not
 you're
 kind
 of


like
 not
 reviewing
 the
 the
 code,
 but


you're
 still
 thinking
 about


architecture.
 Like
 what
 does
 your


average
 day
 look
 like
 in
 terms
 of


tooling?
 You
 know,
 you
 have
 to
 explain


to
 a
 developer
 who
 might
 join
 the
 team.


you
 know,
 at
 at
 one
 point
 you
 didn't
 get


like
 what
 does
 it
 look
 like?


>> It's
 interesting.
 Let's
 let's let's
 go
 a


little
 bit.
 We
 were
 we
 were
 in
 in
 in


April
 with
 Cloud
 Code
 and
 then
 I
 got


really
 hooked
 and
 then
 I
 did
 some
 I
 had


a
 phase
 where
 I
 did
 cursor
 and
 then
 I


did
 I
 I
 used
 Gemini
 2.5
 a
 bit.
 Then
 we


had
 this
 phase
 with
 Opus
 4.
 I
 hooked
 up


a
 lot
 of
 my
 friends
 like
 I
 know
 I
 know


both
 Armen
 and
 and
 Mario
 from
 Vinner.


They
 got
 they
 got
 AI
 pill
 because
 I
 I


was
 addictive.
 You
 know,
 my
 my
 enem
 was


like
 confusing
 them
 and
 then
 they
 tried


it
 out
 and
 then
 and
 then
 eventually
 they


also
 were
 up
 at
 5:00
 a.m.
 and
 I
 called


it
 like
 the
 black
 eye
 club.
 I
 mean,


there's
 a
 reason
 like
 I
 I I
 I
 started
 a


meet
 up
 in
 London
 that
 I
 called
 called


uh
 Cloud
 Code
 Anonymous
 because
 because


it's
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 a
 drug


because
 it's
 so
 it's
 so
 much
 fun.
 Like


to
 to
 me
 what
 what what
 blew
 my
 mind
 so


much
 was
 this
 realization
 that
 I
 can


build
 everything
 now.
 Before
 you
 had
 to


really
 pick
 which
 side
 project
 you
 build


because
 software
 is
 hard.
 Yeah,
 it's


still
 hard.
 But
 now
 like
 I
 I
 am
 this


this
 friction
 that
 I
 talked
 about
 where


I'm
 so
 good
 at
 this
 at
 this
 technology


and
 I'm
 like
 so
 bad
 at
 this
 and
 I'm
 like


oh
 let's
 make
 the
 CLI
 in
 Go.
 I
 have
 no


clue
 about
 Go.
 But
 I
 have
 I
 have
 a
 good


system
 understanding
 and
 once
 you
 have


that
 is
 like
 you
 you
 develop
 a
 feeling


what's
 right
 what's
 wrong
 like
 it's
 it


it
 is
 a
 skill
 in
 itself.
 I
 remember


there
 was
 this
 tweet
 where
 someone
 said,


"Oh,
 when
 you
 write
 the
 code,
 you
 you


feel
 the
 friction
 and
 that's
 why
 that's


how
 you
 make
 good
 architecture."
 I
 feel


the
 same
 friction
 when
 I
 prompt
 because


I
 I
 see
 the
 code
 flying
 by.
 I
 see
 how


long
 it
 takes.
 I
 see
 if
 like
 the
 agent


pushes
 back.
 Um
 I
 see
 if
 what
 it
 creates


looks
 like
 messy
 or
 like
 makes
 sense.


When
 I
 prompt,
 I
 I
 have
 a
 hint
 already


how
 long
 it's
 going
 to
 take.
 If
 it
 takes


much
 longer,
 I
 understand
 that
 I
 messed


up
 somewhere.


>> You
 kind
 of
 feel
 the
 model.
 you
 you
 know


you
 know


>> yeah
 usually
 it's
 like
 this
 or
 if
 it


runs


>> I
 I
 feel
 it's
 very
 much
 a
 symbiosis
 like


I
 I
 learn
 to
 to
 talk


>> may
 I
 even
 say
 dare
 or
 that
 language


more
 so
 it's
 like
 my
 my
 knowledge
 how
 to


use
 those
 things
 improved
 and
 also
 the


models
 improved
 and
 then
 and
 then
 like


over
 the
 time
 between
 between
 April
 and


now
 I
 would
 say
 yeah
 the
 inflection


point
 was
 summer
 where
 it
 just
 got
 so


good
 that
 you
 could
 you
 create
 software


without
 actually
 writing
 code
 by
 hand.


But
 the
 real
 that
 change
 that
 like
 sold


it
 for
 me
 is
 was


again
 GBD
 5.2
 that
 was
 again
 I
 think


it's
 underrated.
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 don't


know
 why
 why
 all
 these
 people
 still
 use


cloud
 code.
 I
 I
 I
 kind
 of
 get
 it.
 It's


it's
 a
 different
 way
 of
 working
 but


whatever
 OpenAI
 cook
 there
 is
 insanely


good.
 pretty
 much
 every
 prompt
 I
 type


gives
 me
 the
 result
 I
 want
 which
 is


insane
 like
 like
 on
 on on
 cloudbot
 the


my
 latest
 product
 I
 use


between
 five
 and
 10
 agents
 in
 parallel


if
 you're
 very
 much
 cloud
 code
 build
 you


have
 to
 forget
 quite
 a
 lot
 of
 the


the
 silliness
 that
 the
 things
 that
 you


have
 to
 do
 to
 create
 good
 output
 with


cloud
 code
 I
 mean
 I
 also
 met
 that
 team


and
 and
 they
 created
 a
 whole
 new


category.
 Like
 cloud
 code
 is
 is
 is
 a


category
 defining
 product
 and
 it
 is


amazing
 for
 general
 purpose
 computer


work
 and
 it
 is
 is
 really
 good
 for
 coding


and
 I
 I
 I
 I
 still
 use
 it
 almost
 every


day.
 But
 for
 writing
 code
 in
 complex


applications,
 Codex
 is
 just
 so
 much


better
 because
 it
 it
 it
 takes
 10
 times


longer.
 um
 Claude
 would


read
 three
 files
 and
 then
 be
 confident


enough
 to
 just
 like
 create
 code
 and
 then


you
 really
 have
 to
 steer
 it
 and
 push
 it


so
 it
 reads
 more
 code
 so
 it
 gets
 it
 sees


a
 bigger
 picture
 of
 your
 codebase
 so


that
 it
 it it
 weaves
 in
 new
 features


better
 and
 Codex
 will
 just
 like
 be


silent
 and
 just
 read
 files
 for
 10


minutes
 and
 if
 you
 if
 you
 only
 work
 on


one
 terminal
 I
 completely
 understand
 how


you
 how
 you
 find
 this
 unbearable


But
 I
 rather
 have
 something
 where
 it's


also
 you
 don't
 tell
 it
 what
 to
 do.
 You


know
 this
 is
 this
 is
 also
 something
 that


people
 don't
 get
 like
 I
 have
 a


conversation
 with
 the
 model.
 It's
 like


oh
 let's
 look
 at
 this
 what
 what what


what
 options
 do
 we
 have
 for
 this


structure?
 Did
 you
 consider
 this


feature?
 It's
 like
 because
 every
 every


session
 is
 like
 the
 model
 starts
 from


having
 no
 understanding
 about
 your


product
 and
 you
 have
 and
 and
 sometimes


you
 have
 to
 just
 give
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 of


pointers.
 What
 about
 this
 and
 this?
 So


it
 explores
 different
 directions
 and
 you


don't
 need
 plan
 mode
 like
 I'm
 just


having
 a
 conversation
 until
 I
 say
 build


this
 it
 will
 not
 build
 this.
 There's


some
 trigger
 words
 because
 it
 it
 is
 they


all
 are
 a
 little
 trigger
 hungry
 but
 as


soon
 as
 I
 say
 let's
 discuss
 or
 give
 me


options
 they
 will
 not
 build
 things
 until


I
 say
 build.


>> So
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 would
 you
 say
 a
 lot


of
 your
 prompting
 or
 a
 good
 part
 of
 it


is
 this
 conversation
 where
 you
 are


pretty
 much
 planning
 together
 with
 the


agent.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 like
 what
 about
 like
 I
 say


okay
 then
 you
 remind
 them
 it's
 like
 okay


we
 need
 documentation
 what
 would
 be
 a


good
 spot
 it
 would
 like
 give
 me
 some


recommendations
 I
 say
 no
 this
 should


really
 be
 its
 own
 page
 do
 we
 need
 a


configuration
 how
 how
 does
 this
 fit
 into


this
 other
 feature
 it's
 like
 I
 am


designing
 the
 system
 because
 I
 have
 this


I
 have
 this
 system
 understanding
 about


how
 how
 is
 my
 my
 product
 how
 are
 the


shapes
 looking
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 line
 by


line
 code
 understanding
 that's
 that's


what
 Codex
 does
 for
 me
 but
 I'm
 the


architect
 you


It
 sounds
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 you're


almost,
 you
 know,
 for


years
 back
 this
 this
 totally
 came
 got


out
 of
 style.
 But
 there
 was
 this
 idea


that
 you
 would
 have
 the
 architect
 with
 a


capital
 A
 who
 used
 to
 be
 a
 software


developer,
 but
 they're
 not
 hands-on


anymore
 because
 they
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time


understanding
 the
 business
 and
 they
 have


these
 developers
 working
 underneath


them.
 And
 some
 companies
 still
 kind
 of


work
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 this,
 but
 most


modern
 companies
 don't.
 But
 some
 banks,


etc.
 I
 met
 people
 there
 who
 are
 capital


architects.
 They
 do
 the
 system
 plan.


They
 talk
 with
 fellow
 architects.
 They


have
 the
 blueprint
 and
 then
 they


literally
 pass
 it
 down
 to
 the
 team
 and


everyone
 hates
 this
 model
 obviously


because
 you
 know
 again
 like
 I
 I
 think
 as


people
 you
 kind
 of
 want
 more.
 The


architect
 is
 never
 on
 call
 for
 for
 this


stuff
 and
 so
 it
 just
 kind
 of
 breaks
 down


in
 practice
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 large
 companies


just
 move
 to
 the
 staff
 engineer
 model


where
 you're
 kind
 of
 all
 working


together.
 Of
 course,
 there's
 people
 who


make
 who
 might
 have
 more
 input,
 but


sounds
 like
 it's
 almost
 like
 this
 world


where
 you
 are
 the
 architect
 who
 kind
 of,


you
 know,
 you
 have
 your
 little
 agents


who
 who
 do
 the
 code,
 except
 in
 this


case,
 you
 are
 of
 course
 fully


responsible
 because
 you're
 still
 an


individual
 contributor.
 You're
 not


you're
 not
 like
 a
 okay,
 you
 might
 say


you're
 a
 manager
 of
 agents
 or
 whatnot,


but
 the
 code
 is
 is
 yours.
 It's
 your


responsibility.
 You're
 going
 to
 be
 on


call.
 If
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 push
 out
 code


that
 takes
 down
 CloudBot,
 which
 it
 did


just
 recently,
 you're
 on
 the
 hook
 for


it,
 right?
 like
 and
 I
 think
 the
 the


difference
 in
 this
 system
 when
 when
 it


was
 in
 companies
 it
 was
 the
 architect


was
 kind
 of
 shielded
 from
 the
 output
 of


their
 work
 because
 there's
 so
 much


people
 and
 so
 much
 process
 etc.
 Well,
 I


wouldn't
 say
 architecture.
 I
 I
 like
 the


word
 builder.


>> Builder.
 Yeah.


>> And
 and and
 I
 think
 also
 that's
 there's


a
 few
 categories
 that
 I
 see
 for
 people


that
 are
 highly
 successful
 using
 using


AI
 and
 people
 who
 really
 struggle.


>> I
 care
 more
 about
 the
 outcome,
 the


product.
 I
 very
 much
 care
 about
 how
 it


feels
 and
 everything,
 but
 how
 the


plumbing
 works
 underneath.


>> I
 care
 structurally,
 but
 you
 know,
 not


to
 the
 not
 the
 biggest
 detail.
 And
 then


there
 are
 people
 who
 really
 love
 to
 to


code
 on
 hard
 problems
 like
 think
 about


algorithms
 don't
 really
 like
 the
 I'm


building
 a
 product
 with
 like
 all
 the


marketing
 all
 the
 they
 they
 more
 like


they
 like
 to
 solve
 hard
 problems
 and


those
 are
 the
 people
 who
 really
 struggle


and
 and
 and
 often
 reject
 AI
 or
 get


really
 sad
 because
 that's
 exactly
 the


job
 where
 that
 AI
 does
 like
 it
 solves


the
 hard
 problems.
 Now
 sometimes
 I
 give


it
 some
 pointers
 but
 many
 times
 I


learned
 I
 learned
 more
 this
 year
 than


last
 five
 years
 around
 around
 software


architecture
 and
 designing.
 I
 the


there's
 so
 much
 inside
 those
 monsters
 um


on
 knowledge
 and
 everything
 is
 just
 a


question
 away
 but
 you
 have
 to
 know
 what


question
 to
 ask.
 Of
 course
 I
 also
 built


this
 Twitter
 thing
 and
 it's
 still
 not


done
 and
 I
 and
 I
 I
 really
 hope
 I
 I'll


get
 back
 to
 it
 at
 one
 one
 time.


everything
 worked
 but
 if
 I
 used
 it
 more


at
 some
 point
 things
 got
 really
 laggy


and
 weird
 and
 then
 it
 worked
 again
 and
 I


just
 couldn't
 figure
 it
 out
 and
 it
 was


like
 really
 difficult
 to
 debug
 because


it
 was
 not
 easy
 to
 reproduce.
 It
 was


just
 like
 you
 use
 it
 more
 and
 things
 get


really
 slow.
 I
 basically
 had
 like


software
 in
 in
 in
 in
 Psql
 like
 in


Postgress
 that
 would
 be
 triggered
 when


certain
 inserts
 were
 were
 doing
 and
 then


the
 database
 would
 would
 get
 really
 busy


and
 the
 model
 couldn't
 see
 it
 because
 it


was
 it
 was
 it
 was
 so
 far
 abstracted
 from


all
 the
 you
 know
 like
 those
 those
 models


are
 really
 good
 at
 tracing
 through
 but


this
 was
 a
 side
 effect
 that
 was
 so
 hard


to
 see
 because
 it
 was
 only
 in
 this
 one


file


a
 function
 that
 had
 no
 connection
 to


anything
 else.
 um
 with
 a
 name
 that
 was


not
 easy
 grabbable.
 I
 just
 never
 asked


the
 right
 question
 until
 I
 was
 like
 do


we
 have
 any
 side
 effects
 for
 this
 and


this
 and
 I
 found
 it
 and
 I
 fixed
 it
 and


it's
 like
 but
 I
 everything
 is
 just
 the


right
 question
 away.


>> Yeah.
 But
 you
 you
 need
 to
 have
 like


knowledge,
 expertise.


>> Yeah.
 You
 experience


>> you
 you
 I
 mean
 so
 so
 so
 these
 are
 the


people
 who
 rejected
 and
 then
 the
 people


who
 who
 care
 a
 bit
 less
 about
 how
 it's


being
 plumbed
 internally
 but
 are
 just


excited
 to
 build
 things.
 They're
 really


successful.
 And
 one
 thing
 that
 also


helped
 me
 is,
 you
 know,
 when
 you
 run
 a


company
 and
 then
 you
 hire
 people,
 you


can't
 breathe
 on
 everyone's
 neck
 and


like
 make
 them
 have
 the
 line
 of
 code


exactly
 that
 way.
 And
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


people
 who
 who
 didn't
 manage
 a
 team,


they
 didn't
 had
 this
 experience
 how
 to


how
 to
 relax
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 understand


that
 yes,
 this
 maybe
 is
 not
 exactly
 that


code
 that
 I
 want,
 but
 it
 will
 get
 me


closer
 to
 my
 goal.
 And
 for
 anything
 that


is
 like


not
 perfect,
 we
 can
 always
 make
 it


better
 and
 like
 put
 more
 time
 into
 it.
 I


very
 much
 believe
 into
 this
 iterative


improvement.
 I
 had
 to
 learn
 to
 let
 go
 a


little
 bit
 at
 my
 company.
 So,
 so,
 so


then
 when
 I
 when
 I
 had
 cloud
 code,
 it


kind
 of
 felt
 like
 I
 have
 like
 I
 have


like
 imperfect,
 sometimes
 silly,
 but


sometimes
 very
 brilliant
 engineers
 that


I
 have
 to
 steer
 and
 where
 we
 where
 we


work
 together
 on
 a
 common
 goal.
 It
 felt


a
 lot
 like
 being
 the
 boss
 again.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 interesting
 now
 you
 know


you
 you
 built
 kind
 of
 software
 I
 guess


the
 traditional
 way
 you
 know
 pre
 AI
 for


15
 years
 or
 even
 more
 than
 15
 years
 and


you
 got
 really
 good
 at
 being
 also


leading
 a
 team
 and
 then
 how
 to
 have
 high


standards.
 You
 really
 cared
 about
 the


the
 craft
 there
 as
 well.
 You've
 now
 kind


of
 been
 I
 guess
 vibe
 coding
 or
 working


with
 agents
 for
 a
 year.
 You're
 comparing


the
 two.
 What
 do
 you
 think?
 What
 do
 you


think
 really
 really
 changed?
 And
 what
 do


you
 think
 are
 things
 that
 kind
 of
 stayed


the
 same
 despite
 all


>> First
 of
 all,
 I
 don't
 like
 I
 don't
 like


the
 term
 VIP
 code.


>> All
 right.
 How
 should
 we
 call
 it?


>> I
 I
 think
 I
 think
 I
 think
 VIP
 coding
 is


by
 now
 almost
 a
 I
 I
 call
 it
 I
 tell


people
 I
 do
 what
 I
 do
 is
 agending


engineering
 with
 a
 little
 star.
 VIP


coding
 starts
 at
 3:00
 a.m.


>> Now
 like
 because
 all
 the
 the
 mundane


stuff
 of
 writing
 code
 is
 automated
 away,


I
 can
 move
 so
 much
 faster.
 But
 also


means
 like
 I
 have
 to
 sing
 so
 much
 more.


I'm
 still
 very
 much
 in
 the
 flow.
 Like
 it


is
 it
 is
 completely
 the
 same
 feeling
 as


for
 me
 as
 as
 I
 I
 very
 much
 get
 in
 this


flow
 state
 but
 it
 is
 mentally
 even
 more


taxing
 because
 I
 have
 I
 don't
 have
 one


employee
 that
 I
 manage.
 I
 have
 like
 five


or
 10
 that
 all
 work
 on
 things
 and
 I


switch
 from
 this
 one
 part
 to
 this
 other


part
 to
 this
 other
 part
 to
 this
 other


part.
 mostly
 because
 of
 I'm
 designing


this
 new
 subsystem
 or
 like
 this
 feature


and
 then
 I
 know
 that
 it
 will
 probably


take
 Codex
 like
 40
 minutes
 or
 or
 one


hour
 to
 build.
 So
 like
 I
 want
 to
 like


have
 the
 plan
 right
 and
 then
 I
 build
 it


and
 then
 I'll
 I'll
 move
 on
 to
 something


else
 but
 then
 this
 is
 cooking
 and
 then
 I


work
 on
 this
 and
 then
 this
 is
 cooking


and
 then
 this
 is
 cooking
 and
 then
 at


some
 point
 this
 is
 cooking
 and
 then
 this


is
 cooking
 and
 then
 I
 go
 back
 to
 this


one.
 So
 like
 I
 I
 I
 I
 switch
 around
 a
 lot


in
 my
 head.
 I
 wish
 I
 wouldn't
 have
 to
 do


that.
 Like
 I'm
 sure
 this
 is
 a


transitionary
 problem
 and
 at
 some
 point


we
 have
 we
 have
 models
 and
 and
 systems


that
 are
 so
 fast
 that
 that
 I
 can


paralyze
 a
 little
 less.
 But
 to
 stay
 in


the
 float
 flow
 state
 I
 need
 to
 massively


parallelize.
 So
 that
 that's
 that's
 how


it
 work.
 I
 go
 back
 to
 there
 and
 and


maybe
 tweak
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 more.
 But


usually
 just
 like
 try
 it
 out
 and
 maybe


then
 this
 is
 ready
 because
 this
 only


took
 like
 20
 minutes.
 So
 like
 I


constantly
 jump
 around.
 Usually
 there's


there's
 one
 main
 project
 that
 has
 my


focus
 and
 I
 have
 like
 some
 satellite


projects
 that
 also
 need
 attention
 but


where
 I
 can
 make
 maybe
 I
 spend
 5
 minutes


it
 does
 something
 for
 half
 an
 hour
 and


and
 and
 I
 try
 it
 and
 it
 doesn't
 need
 uh


so
 much
 capacity
 up
 there.


>> This
 almost
 sounds
 you
 know
 like
 two


things
 come
 to
 mind.
 One
 is
 there's


these
 like
 games
 where
 you
 have
 to


manage
 a
 kitchen
 with
 the
 employee
 and


and
 you
 see
 like
 the
 recipes
 or


something
 come
 out
 and
 you
 need
 to
 jump


and
 do
 it
 again.


>> It's
 like
 Starcraft,
 you
 know,
 you
 have


like
 your
 main
 base
 and
 you
 have
 like


your
 side
 bases.
 They
 give
 you


resources.


>> That
 as
 well.
 And
 also
 one
 thing
 that


just
 came
 to
 mind
 as
 you
 said
 like
 I
 go


there
 and
 I
 watch
 this
 and
 I
 make
 a


decision
 is
 when
 I
 see
 the
 chess
 grand


masters
 play
 multiple
 boards
 at
 once.


You
 see
 see
 sometimes
 they
 20
 boards
 and


they
 always
 all
 you
 they
 go
 there
 they


kind
 of
 you
 can
 see
 that
 they
 just
 like


see
 what's
 on
 that
 board.
 they
 make
 a


decision
 and
 for
 some
 boards
 they
 stop


for
 longer
 I
 guess
 better
 players
 or


better
 opponents.
 It
 feels,
 you
 know,


both
 they're
 occupying
 100%
 of
 of
 their


brain.
 You're
 occupying
 your
 bay
 and


you're
 you're
 kind
 of
 scaling
 yourself


as
 long
 as
 you
 can
 context
 switch.
 The


difference
 the
 difference
 was
 up
 until


with
 with
 cloud
 code
 I
 you
 have
 to
 work


a
 little
 different
 because
 it
 is
 much


faster
 but
 then
 the
 output
 often
 doesn't


work
 on
 the
 first
 try.
 So
 like
 it
 makes


something
 but
 then
 it
 forgot
 to
 update


three
 other
 things.
 it
 crashes
 or
 you


give
 it


the
 good
 thing
 how
 to
 be
 effective
 with


coding
 agent
 is
 always
 like
 you
 have
 to


close
 the
 loop.
 It
 needs
 to
 be
 able
 to


debug
 and
 test
 itself.
 That's
 the
 big


secret.
 Um
 that's
 also
 something
 I
 I


think
 that's
 part
 of
 why
 it
 got
 so
 much


more
 effective.
 Um
 but
 yeah,
 with
 with


with
 clock
 code
 you
 I
 often
 had
 to
 go


back
 and
 like
 fix
 up
 the
 stuff


um
 or
 it
 just
 takes
 a
 lot
 of
 iterations.


So
 in
 the
 end
 it's
 not
 that
 much
 faster.


It's
 just
 more
 interactive.


And
 and
 these
 days
 with
 Cordex
 it
 just


almost
 always
 gets
 it
 right.
 My
 my


general
 strategy
 is
 always
 I
 I
 build
 a


feature
 of
 course
 you
 and
 and
 of
 course


you
 always
 let
 it
 write
 tests
 and
 you


make
 sure
 that
 it
 runs
 it.


>> It
 runs
 them.
 Yes.


So
 even
 even
 when
 I
 write
 a
 MAC
 app,
 I


don't know
 like
 I
 I
 just
 yesterday
 I


debuged
 this
 feature
 where


the
 MAC
 app
 couldn't
 find
 a
 a
 remote


gateway
 but
 like
 the
 the
 same
 code
 in


Typescript
 could
 but
 makeup
 is
 kind
 of


annoying
 to
 debug
 because
 like
 it
 builds


it
 you
 have
 to
 start
 it
 you
 have
 to
 look


at
 it
 you
 have
 to
 like
 say
 no
 this
 is


not
 working.
 So
 now
 I
 just
 said
 it
 like


you
 know
 you're
 going
 to
 build
 a
 CLI


just
 for
 debugging
 that
 invokes
 all
 the


same
 code
 path
 that
 you
 can
 call


yourself
 and
 then
 you
 just
 iterate
 and


you
 fix
 it
 yourself
 and
 then
 it
 will


just
 cook
 and
 it
 just
 cooked
 for
 an
 hour


and
 it
 was
 done
 and
 it
 told
 me
 like


there
 was
 a
 race
 condition
 here
 and
 here


and
 like
 a
 misconfiguration
 blah
 blah


blah
 and
 like
 yeah
 it
 sounds
 sensible.
 I


don't
 need
 to
 I
 don't
 need
 to
 see
 that


code.
 It's
 like
 but
 but
 you
 don't
 need


to
 see
 it
 because
 you
 set
 up
 the


validation
 loops
 and
 you
 trust
 that


because
 it
 ran
 it.
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 I


guess
 I
 guess
 it's
 not
 too
 dissimilar
 to


like
 sometimes
 when
 you
 work
 on
 a
 large


project
 in
 a
 large
 company
 when
 all
 the


tests
 pass
 I
 mean
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 100%


it's
 there
 but
 it's
 it's
 a
 pretty
 good


and
 and
 all
 the
 new
 new
 code
 has
 test
 as


well
 you
 know
 someone
 thought
 about
 it


and
 tested
 it
 and
 and
 all
 that.
 So
 even


even
 on
 my
 on
 the
 very
 latest
 project
 we


always
 had
 bugs


but
 like
 anti-gravity
 has
 like
 a
 certain


a
 certain
 weirdness
 with
 how
 it
 takes


tool
 calls
 in
 the
 loop
 in
 the
 in
 the


format.
 So
 you
 have
 to
 do
 like
 some


filtering.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 that
 broke
 a
 bunch.
 And
 it
 actually


took
 me
 way
 too
 long
 to
 realize
 like


what
 am
 I
 doing
 here?
 I
 just
 need
 to


automate
 this.
 So
 I
 was
 just
 going
 to


codeex.
 like
 design
 life
 tests
 that
 spin


up
 a
 Docker
 container,
 install
 the
 whole


thing,
 spin
 up
 a
 loop,
 use
 my
 API
 keys


from
 this
 and
 this
 file


and
 then
 you
 tell
 the
 model
 to


read
 an
 image,
 create
 an
 image
 before


and
 then
 look
 into
 the
 image
 and
 see


what
 it
 sees.
 So
 I
 I
 don't
 not
 just
 tell


the
 loop,
 I
 still
 tell
 tool
 calling,


make
 it
 work


and
 then
 it
 solved
 itself.
 It
 took


forever,
 but
 it
 it it
 it
 tested
 all
 my


API
 keys
 like
 from
 from
 Entropic
 over


SEI
 over
 GLM
 like
 everything
 and
 it


fixed
 all
 those
 little
 indicies
 where


where
 sometimes
 the
 tool
 calling
 didn't


work
 or
 the
 ordering
 was
 wrong
 because
 I


closed
 the
 loop
 and
 and
 that's
 that's


>> and
 closing
 the
 loop
 you
 mean
 just
 have


a
 way
 to
 to
 have
 have
 the
 agent
 be
 able


to
 validate
 its
 work?


>> Yeah,
 that's
 why
 that's
 the
 whole
 reason


why
 why
 those
 models
 that
 we
 currently


have
 are
 so
 good
 at
 coding.
 But
 like


sometimes
 mediocre
 good
 at
 writing


creative
 because
 there's
 no
 easy
 way
 to


validate
 right
 but
 code
 I
 can
 compile
 I


can
 lint
 I
 can
 execute
 I
 can
 verify
 the


output
 if
 you
 design
 it
 the
 right
 way


you
 have
 a
 perfect
 loop
 like
 even
 now


even
 now
 for
 for
 websites
 I
 built
 the


core
 in
 a
 way
 that
 can
 be
 run
 via
 a
 CLI


so
 it's
 like
 I
 have
 this
 I
 have
 this


perfect
 uh
 execution
 loop
 because
 the


the
 browser
 loop
 is
 insanely
 slow
 you


want
 something
 that
 that
 loops
 fast.
 So


it
 sounds
 like
 one
 thing
 that
 is
 not


really
 changing
 from
 like
 before
 is
 we


had
 this
 before
 like
 backend
 or
 business


logic
 heavy
 he
 heavy
 thing
 could
 easily


be
 or
 more
 easily
 be
 verified
 that
 it's


correct.


>> Surprise
 actually
 using
 aentic
 coding


makes
 you
 a
 better
 coder
 because
 you


have
 to
 have
 to
 think
 harder
 about
 your


your
 your
 architecture
 so
 that
 it's


easier
 verifiable
 because
 verifying
 is


the
 way
 how
 to
 make
 things
 good.
 Well,


then
 remember
 back
 back
 even
 before
 AI


for
 complex
 systems
 like
 once
 you
 got


someone
 who
 built
 these
 things
 before


what
 they
 started
 with
 how
 do
 we
 make
 it


testable
 right
 like
 you
 you
 need
 to


design
 interfaces
 classes
 testable
 you


need
 to
 think
 about
 like
 am
 I
 going
 to


fake
 things
 will
 I
 use
 mocks
 will
 I
 use


end
 toend
 testing
 which
 will
 be
 long
 etc


but
 these
 are
 like
 really
 hard


architectural
 decisions
 and
 once
 you


make
 them
 they're
 I
 guess
 harder
 to


change
 in
 your
 in
 your
 word
 you
 know


like
 the
 model
 would
 cook
 a
 lot
 longer


if
 you
 asked
 it
 to
 make
 a
 massive


refactor
 acture
 and
 you
 know
 if
 you
 have


test
 it'll
 get
 it
 right
 but
 you
 know now


these
 we
 we
 still
 have
 these
 trade-offs


>> yeah
 it's
 still
 it's
 still
 software
 it's


it's
 I
 I
 would
 say
 I
 write
 better
 code


now
 that
 I
 don't
 write
 code
 myself


anymore
 and
 I
 wrote
 really
 good
 code
 but


but
 like
 even
 back
 at
 the
 company


sometimes
 testing
 was
 so
 tedious
 and
 you


come
 up
 with
 all
 those
 edge
 cases
 and


and
 and
 the
 branching


>> I
 mean
 outside
 of
 Ken
 Debbec
 who
 I


deeply
 respect
 and
 he
 was
 on
 the
 podcast


and
 we
 We
 we
 we
 talk
 like
 he
 he
 still


writes
 test
 first
 and
 he
 tells
 me
 that


he's
 not
 mad
 at
 me
 for
 not
 writing
 it


but
 if
 you
 want
 to
 write
 like
 you
 know


poor
 quality
 code
 it's
 on
 you.
 Uh
 but
 I


don't
 know
 many
 developers
 myself


included
 I
 never
 liked
 writing
 tests
 and


even
 even
 when
 I
 pretended
 that
 I
 did
 I


I
 just
 never
 did.
 It's
 a
 little
 bit
 like


writing
 documentation
 and
 writing
 tests


to
 me
 it
 was
 never
 a
 creative


expression.
 It
 is
 so
 good
 now
 like
 I
 I


would
 say
 for
 my
 last
 project
 I
 have


really
 good
 documentation
 and
 I
 didn't


write
 a
 single
 line
 myself
 like
 no
 I


don't
 write
 the
 test
 I
 don't
 write


documentation
 I
 explain
 the
 model
 the


trade-off
 so
 like
 why
 we
 did
 something


like
 this
 and
 then
 tell
 it
 like
 like


write
 that
 write
 the
 entrance
 section


beginner
 friendly
 and
 then
 add
 more


technical
 detail
 at
 the
 end
 and
 it
 is
 so


good
 I
 never
 had
 a
 project
 with
 that


good
 documentation
 just
 by
 every
 time
 I


design
 a
 feature
 this
 is
 a
 part
 of
 this


a
 part
 of
 the
 process
 And
 also
 like


testing
 I
 was
 like
 okay
 we
 built
 this


how
 are
 we
 going
 to
 test
 this?
 Yeah
 we


could
 do
 this
 and
 this
 and
 this.
 What
 if


we
 build
 it
 this
 way
 and
 oh
 yeah
 then
 we


can
 test
 it
 better.
 So
 it's
 like
 this
 is


now
 part
 of
 my
 singing
 because
 I
 I


always
 think
 like
 how
 do
 I
 close
 the


loop?
 How
 do
 I
 the
 model
 always
 needs
 to


be
 able
 to
 verify
 the
 work
 itself


um
 which
 automatically
 steers
 me
 to


better
 architecture.
 So
 why
 do
 you
 think


there's,
 you
 know,
 a
 bunch
 of
 like


experienced
 devs
 who
 are
 still
 pushing


quite
 a
 bit
 back
 on
 on
 just
 like
 the


idea
 that
 AI
 can
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 this?


>> That
 was
 a
 week
 ago.
 I
 I
 stumbled
 over
 a


a
 blog
 post
 by
 Nala
 Coco
 with
 love
 that


I
 deeply
 respect
 and
 learned
 a
 lot
 from.


And
 this
 blog
 post
 was
 just
 was
 a


dissing
 of
 the
 current
 way
 how
 models


work.
 And
 and
 what
 he
 did
 was
 he
 he


tested
 like
 five
 or
 six
 models
 including


some
 that
 make
 no
 sense
 like
 the
 the


Open
 EI
 120
 billion
 open-
 source
 one


that
 is
 not
 good
 enough
 to
 write
 good


code
 you
 know
 it's
 like
 and
 he
 just
 he


he
 wrote
 a
 prompt
 as
 far
 as
 I
 understand


it
 there
 was
 there
 was
 not
 a
 lot
 of


information
 on
 the
 website
 but
 to
 me
 it


sounded
 like
 he
 wrote
 a
 prompt
 he
 put
 it


on
 claude
 web
 and
 and
 he
 pressed
 send


and
 And
 then
 he
 took
 the
 output
 and
 ran


it
 and
 it
 didn't
 compile
 and
 he
 was


disappointed.
 But
 he's
 like,
 "Of
 course


it
 will
 not
 work.
 Do
 you
 think
 I
 can


write
 buck-free
 code
 on
 the
 first


attempt?"
 And
 those
 little
 those


models
 are
 ghosts
 of
 our
 collective


human
 knowledge.
 They
 work
 very
 similar


in
 many
 ways.
 Of
 course,
 you
 don't
 get


it
 right
 the
 first
 time.
 Like
 there
 will


be
 mistakes.
 That's
 why
 you
 have
 to


close
 the
 feedback
 loop.
 And
 also
 you


don't
 just
 send
 a
 prompt
 to
 the
 model,


you
 start
 a
 conversation.
 Hey,
 this
 is


what
 I
 want
 to
 build.
 It's
 like
 you
 he


complained
 that
 it
 used
 old
 API.
 Yeah,


you
 didn't
 specify
 the
 Mac
 OS
 version.


So
 it
 so
 so
 it
 made
 an
 assumption
 to


default
 to
 like
 old
 API
 because
 that


information
 was
 missing
 and
 it
 is
 it
 is


trained
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 data,
 not
 just
 the


last
 two
 years
 and
 there's
 just
 more
 old


data
 than
 new
 data.
 So
 this
 is
 like
 the


more
 you
 understand
 how
 those
 little


beasts
 think,
 the
 the
 better
 you
 get
 at


prompting.
 Um
 and
 then
 and
 then
 and
 then


he
 he
 spent
 maybe
 I
 don't
 know
 a
 day
 or


so
 on
 on
 playing
 with
 it
 and
 then
 just


decided
 that
 this
 technology
 is
 still


not
 really
 good.
 But
 to
 be
 effective
 you


have
 to
 spend
 significantly
 more
 time.


You
 know,
 it's
 it's
 like
 it's
 like
 you


know
 how
 to
 play
 guitar
 and
 I
 put
 you
 on


the
 piano
 and
 you
 tried
 a
 bit.
 It's


like,
 "Oh,
 this
 sucks.
 I
 go
 back
 to
 my


guitar."
 No.
 No.
 It's
 like
 it's
 it's
 a


different
 way
 of
 building.
 It's
 a


different
 way
 of
 thinking.
 You
 have
 no


idea
 how
 often
 I
 screamed
 at
 like
 3:00


a.m.
 to
 cloud
 code
 because
 it
 did


something
 silly.
 I
 slowly
 started
 to


understand
 why
 those
 things
 do
 what
 they


do
 with
 like
 exactly
 the
 way
 I
 tell
 it


to
 do
 things.
 And
 sometimes
 you
 can


literally
 ask
 you
 can
 even
 even
 last


year
 like
 I
 for
 this
 project
 I
 the
 last


project
 like
 clotboard
 I
 feel
 like
 a


human
 merge
 button
 because
 the
 community


is
 like
 blowing
 off
 and
 all
 I
 do
 is
 like


reviewing
 PRs.
 I
 I
 I
 I
 have
 very
 little


time
 to
 actually
 write
 code
 myself


anymore.


>> And
 in
 the
 beginning
 it
 would
 often
 like


just
 cherrypick
 things
 and
 would
 close


the
 PR
 and
 I
 was
 like
 so
 annoyed.
 So
 was


I'm
 like
 why
 are
 you
 doing
 this?
 Yeah.


When
 you
 say
 this
 and
 this
 I
 interpret


this
 this
 and
 this.
 It
 was
 like
 ah
 like


I
 I
 learned
 the
 language
 of
 the
 machine


a
 little
 bit
 more.
 I
 tweaked
 my
 my


prompting
 and
 now
 I
 get
 exactly
 what
 I


want
 because
 it's
 it's
 a
 skill
 like
 any


other
 skill.


>> Yeah.
 And
 this
 is
 like
 Simon
 Wilson
 has


been
 saying
 the
 same
 thing
 even
 though


he's
 been
 using
 it
 for
 for
 years
 and
 I


think
 everyone
 I
 think
 once
 I
 start
 to


use
 it
 I
 also
 realize
 like
 I'm
 not
 I'm


okay
 at
 it
 but
 I
 I
 I
 I
 could
 do
 better.


What
 if
 we
 put
 this
 to
 a
 real
 test?
 cuz


I
 think
 it's
 fair
 to
 say
 that
 right
 now


you're
 building
 CloudBot
 which
 is
 a
 you


know
 it's
 not
 something
 that
 generates


revenue
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 users
 and
 it's


blowing
 up
 and
 it's
 it's
 a
 really
 cool


tool
 but
 it's
 not
 PSPDF
 kit
 which
 is
 a


business
 that
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 revenue
 is


hinging
 over
 it
 if
 today
 you
 know
 we


just
 wiped
 PSPF
 kit
 does
 not
 exist
 you


need
 to
 rebuild
 PSPDF
 kit
 you
 now
 have


these
 agents
 how
 differently
 would
 it


look
 how
 much
 would
 you
 trust
 it
 what


would
 you
 delegate
 what
 you
 would
 you


validate
 and
 and
 when
 you
 know
 you
 built


up
 a
 team
 around
 it
 because
 now
 it's
 a


profitable
 business
 at
 the
 very
 least


you
 need
 to
 hire
 sales
 people
 whatot
 how


do
 you
 think
 the
 team
 would
 look


different
 today
 with
 that
 same
 product


cuz
 you
 you
 know
 exactly
 what
 it
 took
 to


build
 it
 and
 you
 also
 know
 what
 these


tools
 can
 do
 today


>> I
 could
 easily
 run
 a
 company
 with


30%
 of
 the
 people
 it
 would
 probably
 be


quite
 difficult
 to
 find
 people


on
 that
 level
 but
 you
 you
 you
 want
 you


want
 to
 have
 really
 senior
 engineers


that
 really
 understand
 what
 they
 build


but
 that
 are
 also
 comfortable
 in
 in
 in


delegating
 and
 know
 which
 parts
 are


actually
 important
 to
 to
 work
 on
 and


which
 parts


I
 can
 vibe.
 That's
 still
 something
 I


don't
 see.
 I
 don't
 see
 a
 lot
 like
 like


especially
 in
 the
 AI
 world,
 there
 is
 so


much
 crap
 on
 Twitter,
 there's
 there's
 so


many
 people
 that
 are
 loud
 but
 clearly


have
 no
 clue
 what
 they're
 doing.
 There's


there's
 so
 many
 there's
 so
 many
 dumb


concepts
 around
 like
 I'm
 sorry,
 but
 the


Ralph
 Wigum
 one
 gh
 like
 this
 is
 again


another
 another
 silliness
 people
 use
 to


work
 around


uh
 model
 limitations
 of
 of
 of
 of
 Opus


that
 you
 don't
 even
 need
 when
 you
 use


Codex.
 There's
 there's
 maybe
 a
 few
 cases


where
 you
 have
 a
 really
 long
 list
 of


individual
 tasks
 that
 can
 be
 automated,


but
 that's
 usually
 not
 how
 software


building
 works.
 So
 there's
 these
 people


who
 I
 see
 so
 many
 people
 building
 up


this
 elaborated
 orchestration
 layers
 and


then
 you
 have
 like
 beats
 that


automatically
 creates
 tickets
 and
 then


your
 agent
 does
 tickets
 and
 then
 your


agent
 emails
 the
 other
 agent
 and
 then


you
 build
 up
 this
 this
 elaborate
 mess.


What
 for?
 Oh
 yeah,
 they
 did
 they
 design


the
 the
 spec
 for
 like
 a
 few
 hours
 and


then
 you
 just
 like
 the
 machine
 builds
 it


in
 the
 whole
 day.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


believe
 this
 works.
 Like
 like
 this
 is


this
 is
 this
 is
 the
 waterfall
 model
 of


software
 building.
 This
 we
 learned
 long


ago
 that
 this
 doesn't
 work.
 Like


yes,
 people
 work
 differently
 and
 maybe


it
 does
 work
 for
 some.
 I
 just
 I
 just
 I


don't
 see
 how
 this


how
 this
 could
 work
 for
 me.
 Like
 I
 I


have
 to
 start


with
 an
 idea
 and
 often
 I
 purposefully


underprompt
 the
 agent
 so
 it
 would
 do


something


that
 would
 give
 me
 new
 ideas.
 You
 like


maybe
 like
 80%
 of
 the
 things
 I
 assumed


were
 like
 crap
 but
 like
 there
 were
 like


two
 things
 like
 oh
 I
 didn't
 think
 about


that
 way.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 then
 I
 I
 I
 iterate
 and
 and
 and
 shape


the
 project
 and
 I
 have
 to
 I
 have
 to


click
 it.
 I
 have
 to
 like
 I
 have
 to
 feel


it.
 I
 feel
 I
 feel
 to
 make
 good
 software


I
 you
 know
 one
 thing
 those
 those
 things


often
 lack
 is
 taste.
 I
 have
 to
 feel
 like


how
 does
 this
 feature
 feel
 and
 and
 the


beauty
 now
 is
 that
 features
 are
 so
 easy


I
 can
 just
 like
 throw
 it
 away
 or
 like


reprompt
 it.
 My
 building
 model
 is


usually
 very
 much
 forward.
 It's
 very


rarely
 that
 I
 actually
 revert
 and
 have


to
 go
 back.
 It's
 just
 like
 okay
 no
 then


let's
 change
 this.
 No
 let's
 do
 this.


It's
 like
 it's
 like
 shaping.
 I
 I
 love


how
 this
 like
 you
 start
 with
 a
 rock
 and


then
 you
 like
 sisle
 away
 at
 it
 and
 like


pick
 different
 areas
 and
 and
 and
 then


slowly
 like
 this
 statue
 emerges
 out
 of


out
 of
 marble.
 That's
 that's
 how
 I
 see


that's
 how
 I
 see
 building
 something.
 I
 I


guess
 reflecting
 on
 how
 software
 engine


is
 changing.
 This
 seems
 like
 a
 change


because
 before
 before
 we
 had
 AI
 or
 any


of these
 agents,
 upfront
 planning
 did


make
 a
 difference.
 you
 know,
 writing
 at


PSPDF
 could
 you
 insisted
 I
 think
 to
 have


a
 proposal
 where
 people
 put
 a
 lot
 of


thought
 up
 front
 to
 specify
 and
 do
 all


because
 it
 was
 expensive
 to
 I
 guess
 to


to
 build
 to
 to
 do
 you
 think
 this
 is


changing
 because
 of
 the
 the
 cost
 of
 just


writing
 code
 is
 is
 going
 down
 or


>> I
 mean
 I
 still
 I
 still
 I
 still
 plan
 and


I
 but


>> you
 still
 do
 yes


>> but
 I
 don't
 put
 as
 much
 into
 it
 because


I
 it's
 now
 so
 much
 easier
 to
 just
 like


try
 and
 look
 at
 the
 results
 and
 then
 see


if
 oh
 yeah
 this
 this
 shape
 could
 work
 or


no
 we
 have
 to
 like
 the
 tweaking
 and
 even


even
 like
 oh
 no
 we
 have
 to
 like
 do
 it
 a


completely
 different
 way
 isn't
 so
 much


cheaper
 that
 it's
 to
 me
 it
 became
 much


more
 playful.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 guess
 cuz
 cuz
 like
 you


know
 when
 you're
 working
 even
 if
 you


have
 like
 a
 new
 grad
 on
 the
 team
 or
 an


intern
 you
 know
 you
 give
 them
 something


they
 work
 it
 for
 a
 day
 or
 two
 now
 you


give
 them
 another
 it's
 another
 day
 or


two
 you
 know
 and
 and
 we're
 not
 talking


days
 here
 we're
 talking
 minutes
 or
 like


if
 it's
 a
 longunning
 task
 like
 10
 20


minutes
 at
 at
 worst.
 Plus,
 you're
 not


just
 waiting
 on
 that
 thing.
 You
 have


parallel
 things
 running.
 So,
 it's
 not


that
 much
 of
 a
 waste,
 if
 you
 will,


>> in
 in in
 in
 in
 cloud.


At
 the
 beginning
 I
 had
 this
 assumption


of
 like
 one
 agent
 and
 then
 eventually


changed
 to
 multiple
 agents
 and
 there
 was


the
 assumption
 of
 like
 one
 provider
 like


WhatsApp
 and
 now
 it's
 multiple
 ones
 and


changing
 that
 was
 like
 such
 a
 pain
 would


would
 have
 been
 such
 a
 pain
 if
 I
 would


have
 written
 it
 myself
 because
 you
 have


to
 weave
 in
 literally
 everything
 through


the
 whole
 logic
 of
 the
 application


and
 yeah
 it
 took
 Codex
 like
 three
 hours


it
 would
 have
 taken
 me
 like
 two
 weeks


you
 know
 so
 so
 that
 upfront
 planning.
 I


I
 could
 have
 realized
 that
 in
 the


beginning,
 but
 now
 I
 I
 know
 that
 like
 I


can
 just
 change
 things
 and
 it's
 it's


much
 it's
 much
 easier
 to
 work
 down
 your


technical
 depth
 or
 your
 you
 know,
 you


evolve
 how
 you
 think
 about
 a
 project
 as


you
 build
 a
 project.
 That's
 why
 I
 don't


believe
 in
 I
 don't
 know
 things
 like
 Gas


Town
 where
 like
 you
 write
 up
 the
 spec


and
 then
 it
 builds
 itself
 and
 then
 it's


done.
 How
 can
 you
 even
 know
 what
 you


want
 to
 build
 before
 you
 built
 it?
 you


learn
 so
 much
 in
 the
 process
 of
 building


it
 that
 will
 go
 back
 into
 your
 thinking


of
 how
 this
 how
 the
 how
 the
 system


actually
 will
 end
 up
 being
 to
 me
 this
 is


very
 much
 it
 is
 very
 much
 a
 circle
 um


until
 I
 you
 don't
 I
 don't
 you
 don't
 walk


up
 the
 mountain
 like
 this
 you
 go
 you
 go


around
 and
 sometimes
 you
 like
 you
 you


you
 stray
 off
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 path
 but


but
 eventually
 you
 you
 you
 reach
 the
 top


that's
 that's
 how
 I
 feel
 so


>> then
 you
 know
 you've
 been
 building
 cloud


bot
 for
 what
 like
 two
 months
 three


months
 non-stop
 upish
 or
 or
 like
 like


how
 long?


>> Let
 me
 let
 me
 let's
 switch
 a
 little
 bit


gear.
 So,
 one
 of
 the
 ideas
 that
 got
 me


back
 was
 even
 even
 in
 in
 April
 May
 was
 I


I
 wanted
 to
 have
 this


hyper
 personal
 assistant
 and
 not
 like


not
 like
 one
 that
 sends
 you
 a
 good


morning
 email.
 Oh,
 these
 are
 your
 three


tasks.
 No,
 one
 that
 has
 a
 really
 deep


understanding


of
 me
 and
 doesn't
 just
 I
 don't
 know
 I


meet
 a
 friend
 and
 then
 and
 then
 when
 I


go
 home
 it
 would
 ping
 me,
 hey,
 how
 was


how
 was
 that
 meeting?
 Or
 one
 that
 would


wake
 me
 up
 one
 day
 and
 say,
 "Hey,
 you


haven't
 texted
 Thomas
 in
 3
 weeks
 and
 I


noticed
 he's
 he's
 in
 town
 right
 now


because
 I
 checked
 his
 Instagram
 account.


Do
 you
 want
 to
 say
 hi?"
 or
 something


that
 says,
 "Hey,
 I
 noticed
 every
 time


you
 meet
 that
 and
 that
 person,
 you're


sad.
 Why
 is
 that?"
 Like
 something


something
 that
 is
 deeply
 personal.
 Um


like
 almost
 the
 the
 anti-orem.
 It's
 kind


of
 like
 the
 movie
 Her,
 but
 but
 that's


where
 the
 technology
 is
 going.
 Those


models
 are
 really
 good
 at
 understanding


text.
 the
 the
 the
 bigger
 the
 context
 is,


the
 more
 patterns
 they
 see.
 And
 even


though
 they're
 like
 matrix
 calculation


without
 a
 soul,
 it
 very
 often
 feels


different.
 So
 this
 was
 like
 one
 of
 these


ideas
 and
 I
 even
 created
 a
 company
 I


called
 a
 mant
 machina
 like
 the
 loving


machine.
 But
 in
 summer
 when
 I
 explored


it,
 the
 models
 weren't
 quite
 there
 yet.


I
 got
 some
 results
 that
 it
 was
 like
 okay


this
 is
 like
 I'm
 a
 little
 too
 much
 on


the
 edge
 of
 what
 I
 need
 right
 now
 which


it
 was
 very
 exciting
 because
 I
 know
 that


that
 the
 the
 state
 of
 AI
 goes
 so
 fast


that
 oh
 I
 can
 just
 revisit
 that
 in
 like


a
 little
 later
 and
 and
 one
 of
 the
 ideas


also
 was
 is
 that
 I
 assume
 that
 all
 of


the
 big
 corporations
 right
 now
 are
 very


much
 working
 on
 personal
 assistance
 in


the
 future.
 Yeah,


>> everyone
 will
 have
 you
 will
 have
 your


best
 friend
 who
 is
 a
 a
 freaking
 machine


that
 will
 understand
 you,
 that
 will
 know


everything
 from
 you,
 that
 will
 can
 do


tasks
 for
 you,
 that
 will
 be
 proactive,


that
 will
 require
 a
 lot
 of
 tokens,
 but


everyone
 who
 can
 afford
 it
 will
 have


one.
 And
 of
 course,
 this
 will
 democ


democratize
 and
 and
 trickle
 down
 to
 like


more
 and
 more
 people
 as
 as
 we
 learn
 how


to
 build
 more
 efficient
 systems
 and
 and


and
 hook
 up
 on
 on
 on
 chips.
 No
 question


this
 is
 where
 the
 things
 are
 going.
 You


see
 like
 the
 first
 things
 with
 like


OpenAI
 who
 who
 launched
 pulse
 with
 some


productivity
 but
 we
 just
 don't
 have


enough
 compute
 yet
 to
 offer
 this
 as
 a


feature
 and
 also
 it's
 it's
 quite


difficult.
 My
 idea
 always
 was
 like
 ah
 I


kind
 of
 want
 something
 that
 runs
 on
 my


computer
 and
 where
 the
 data
 is


>> it's
 yours


>> is
 is
 actually
 mine
 and
 not
 and
 it
 it's


also
 quite
 scary
 that
 like
 you
 you
 give


openropic
 access
 to
 your
 email
 your


calendar
 your
 your
 dating
 apps
 I
 don't


know
 if
 you
 talk
 to
 to
 to
 your
 normie


friends
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 friends
 in
 they


use
 that
 a
 lot
 to
 basically
 have
 a
 a


therapist


And
 it
 it
 does
 work
 incredibly
 well.


Like
 it's
 it's
 a
 really
 great
 listener.


It
 understands
 your
 problems
 and
 unless


like
 some
 of
 versions
 of
 40
 that
 are


like
 sure
 this
 is
 a
 great
 idea.
 I
 want


to
 put
 French
 fries
 into
 a
 salad.
 It
 it


works
 really
 well.
 And
 I
 did
 that
 too


like
 to
 like
 re
 I
 mean
 part
 of
 it
 just


is
 like
 the
 the
 act
 of
 reflecting


already
 is
 helping
 you.
 So
 it
 would
 even


work
 if
 the
 machine
 would
 only
 repeat


exactly
 what
 you
 wrote
 to
 a
 degree.
 But


it
 actually
 gives
 insightful
 questions.


It's
 actually
 it
 it
 got
 really
 good.
 So


I
 had
 this
 idea
 of
 this
 like
 assistant


but
 the
 tech
 wasn't
 there.
 So
 I
 did


other
 part
 and
 I
 I
 built
 a
 whole
 bunch


of
 fun
 stuff
 with
 like
 of
 course
 like
 I


built
 VIP
 tunnel
 this
 in
 your
 career
 to


become
 like
 an
 authentic
 engineer
 you


have
 this
 phase.
 It's
 a
 trap
 phase
 where


you
 you're
 looping
 and
 building
 your
 own


tools
 to
 like
 optimizing
 your
 own


workflow.
 But
 this
 idea
 of
 like
 this


hyper
 personal
 agent


stuck
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 then


over
 the
 last
 few
 months
 I
 I
 really


started
 I
 built
 it
 but
 finally


initially
 I
 didn't
 even
 had
 the
 the


scope
 that
 it
 has
 now.
 Like
 I
 called
 it


WhatsApp
 relay.
 I
 just
 I
 just
 I
 just


wanted
 to
 do
 to
 trigger
 stuff
 on
 my


computer
 with
 WhatsApp.
 So,
 I
 built
 like


a
 WhatsApp
 relay
 where
 I
 had
 an
 agent


that
 could
 do
 stuff
 with
 my
 computer
 and


then
 I
 I
 was
 traveling
 to
 Morocco
 for
 a


friend's
 birthday
 and


was
 out
 most
 of
 the
 day
 and
 just
 used


WhatsApp
 to
 to
 talk
 to
 my
 agent
 and
 I


was
 kind
 of
 hooked.
 It
 it it
 was
 guiding


me
 through
 the
 city.
 It
 was
 making


jokes.
 It
 could
 text
 other
 friends
 via


WhatsApp
 from
 me.


And
 I
 remember
 I
 I
 was
 blown
 away


because
 I
 in
 the
 beginning
 the
 tech
 was


very
 scrappy
 but
 I
 I
 built
 in
 something


where
 I
 could
 send
 it
 an
 image.
 Didn't


even
 use
 the
 proper
 thing
 to
 send
 an


image.
 I
 just
 gave
 the
 the


a
 string
 and
 it
 could
 do
 the
 read
 tool


to
 like
 read
 the
 string.
 And
 then
 I
 was


in
 Morocco
 and
 was
 just
 like
 just
 like


not
 seeing
 it
 and
 saying
 it
 a
 voice
 a


voice
 message
 but
 it
 didn't
 build
 that.


And
 then
 like
 like
 30
 seconds
 later
 it


replied
 to
 my
 voice
 message.
 I'm
 like,


"How
 the
 did
 you
 do
 that?"
 Oh,
 yeah.
 You


sent
 me
 a
 file
 and
 and
 then
 I
 looked
 at


the
 header
 and
 I
 found
 that
 it's
 OG.
 So,


I
 used
 FFmpeg
 to
 convert
 it.
 And
 then
 I


I
 looked
 for
 Visper
 on
 your
 computer,


but
 it's
 not
 installed.
 But
 I
 found
 the


OpenAI
 key.
 So,
 I
 did
 a
 curl
 to
 open


server,
 let
 it
 translate,
 and
 I'm
 like,


"Holy
 cow."
 like
 this
 was
 Opus
 4.5
 and


it's
 so
 incredibly
 resourceful
 like
 you


just
 did
 this
 you
 know
 other
 people
 say


oh
 you
 need
 a
 skill
 or
 some
 system
 no


just
 like
 it
 just
 figured
 it
 out
 I


slowly
 got
 hooked
 on
 the
 thing
 I
 I
 used


it
 I
 used
 it
 to
 wake
 me
 up
 and
 it
 was


running
 I
 it
 was
 running
 on
 my
 Mac


Studio
 in
 London
 and
 was
 connecting
 over


SSH
 to
 my
 MacBook
 in
 in
 Morocco
 and
 was


turning
 on
 the
 music
 and
 making
 it


louder
 louder
 is
 because
 I
 didn't
 reply.


And
 to
 make
 that
 work,
 I
 I
 added
 a


heartbeat.
 So,
 which
 which
 in
 a
 way
 is


insane
 from
 a
 security
 perspective.
 You


have
 a
 model
 that
 you
 prompt
 with
 do


something
 cool
 and
 surprise
 me
 that
 you


send
 every
 few
 minutes
 to
 make
 it


proactive
 and
 like
 go
 through
 your
 task


list.
 Uh
 like
 probably
 the
 most


expensive
 alarm
 clock
 ever.
 But
 it
 was


just
 hilarious.
 And
 also
 the
 text
 it


sends
 like
 cuz
 I
 I
 I
 was
 I
 had
 a
 balloon


fart
 and
 it
 it
 knew
 that
 I
 had
 to
 wake


up
 very
 early
 and
 I
 didn't
 reply
 and
 it


was
 like
 you
 could
 see
 the
 reasoning


Peter's
 not
 responding
 but
 Peter
 has
 to


wake
 up.
 No,
 no,
 no,
 no,
 no,
 no
 sleep.


Like
 I
 it
 was
 bitching
 to
 me
 and
 then
 I


I
 showed
 it
 to
 the
 the
 the
 friends
 I
 was


with
 and
 everybody
 was
 like
 hooked.
 Like


this
 is
 something
 magical
 and
 I
 was


hooked
 too.
 Um,
 and
 then
 I
 I
 I
 went
 on


Twitter
 and
 I
 got
 the
 most
 muted


responses
 cuz
 nobody
 would
 get
 it.
 I


feel
 it's
 somewhat
 of
 a
 of
 a
 new


category
 of
 products.
 Um,
 that
 a
 little


bit
 like
 your
 story
 with
 like
 you
 know


when
 you
 didn't
 get
 the
 iPhone
 uh
 from


the
 marketing
 campaigns
 on
 TV
 and


anywhere
 and
 then
 you
 had
 to
 use
 it.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 I
 worked
 on
 it
 but
 only
 the


last
 two
 months
 and
 it
 the
 name
 changed


from
 V
 relay
 to
 at
 some
 point
 a
 claude


uh
 said
 like
 then
 what
 is
 this
 name
 like


it
 doesn't
 fit
 the
 feature
 set
 anymore


because
 like
 I
 had
 like
 in
 there
 and


other
 features
 so
 I
 renamed
 it
 to
 to


Claudius
 because
 it's
 an
 inside
 joke


because
 I
 like
 Doctor
 Who.
 I
 felt


cloudbot
 is
 is
 a
 better
 name
 has
 a


better
 domain
 and
 explained
 the
 product


better.
 So
 I
 did
 on
 all
 the
 domains
 and


then
 I
 I
 also
 quietly
 built
 up
 my
 army


because
 to
 make
 this
 work
 you
 want
 you


want
 everything
 to
 be
 a
 CLI.
 So
 I
 was


just
 building
 CLI
 for
 everything
 like


for
 Google
 for
 my
 bed
 for
 lambs
 for


music.


>> Why
 CLIs?
 Why
 not
 why
 not
 MCPs?
 And
 what


do
 you
 think
 about
 MCPS
 anyway?


>> As
 a
 crutch
 it's
 it's
 I
 think
 that
 the


the
 best
 thing
 that
 came
 out
 of
 MCPS
 is


that
 it
 made
 companies
 reync
 to
 open
 up


more
 APIs.


>> Mh.
 But
 the
 whole
 concept
 is
 is
 silly.


You
 you
 have
 to
 pre-export


all
 the
 functions
 of
 all
 the
 tools
 and


all
 the
 explanations
 when
 your
 session


loads
 and
 then
 the
 model
 has
 to
 send
 a


precise
 blob
 of
 JSON
 there
 and
 gets
 JSON


back.
 But
 surprise,
 models
 are
 really


good
 at
 using
 bash.
 And
 like
 imagine


imagine
 you
 have
 a
 better
 service.
 So


the
 model
 could
 ask
 for


list
 of
 available
 cities
 and
 then
 get


like
 500
 cities
 back
 and
 then
 it
 has
 to


pick
 one
 city
 out
 of
 500
 city.
 But
 it


cannot
 filter
 that
 list
 because
 that's


not
 part
 of
 how
 MCP
 works.
 And
 then
 you


say,
 "Okay,
 give
 me
 the
 weather
 for


London."
 And
 you
 would
 get
 like
 the


weather,
 temperature,
 wind,
 rain,
 and


like
 50
 other
 things
 that
 I'm
 not


interested
 in
 because
 I
 just
 want
 to


know
 is
 it
 raining
 or
 not?
 Probably


raining
 because
 London.
 But
 the
 model


needs
 to
 digest
 everything
 and
 then
 you


have
 like
 so
 much
 crap
 in
 your
 context.


Whereas
 if
 it's
 a
 CLI,
 I
 could
 use
 just


it
 could
 use
 GQ
 and
 you
 could
 filter
 for


exactly
 what
 it
 needs.
 But
 does
 does
 not


seem
 like
 a
 limitation
 that
 everything


is
 loaded
 around
 the
 MCP
 in
 the
 context.


That
 seems
 a
 problem.
 Like
 it
 sounds


like
 it
 could
 work
 if
 MCPS
 were
 not
 in


the
 context
 and
 there
 was
 a
 way
 to


discover
 or
 decide
 which
 one
 to
 use.


>> That's
 what
 that's
 what
 companies
 are


building
 now.
 But
 there's
 still
 the


problem
 of
 that
 I
 cannot
 chain
 them.
 I


cannot
 I
 cannot
 easily
 build
 a
 script


that
 says,
 "Hey,
 get
 me
 get
 me
 like
 all


the


>> all
 the
 CDs
 that
 are
 over
 25
 degrees
 and


then
 and
 then
 filter
 out
 only
 that
 part


of
 information
 and
 like
 pack
 it
 in
 one


command."
 That's
 it's
 all
 individual
 MCP


calls.
 I
 cannot
 I
 cannot
 script
 it.


>> Yeah.
 But
 but
 I
 guess
 this
 is
 just
 a


matter
 of
 time
 because
 if
 we
 think
 about


like
 you
 know
 when
 when
 I'm
 building
 a


weather
 app
 right
 now,
 I
 know
 that
 you


know
 even
 without
 AI,
 I
 know
 I
 need
 to


build
 up
 this
 thing.
 I
 need
 to
 I
 needs


to
 fetch
 the
 data.
 So
 I
 will
 search
 what


kind
 of
 APIs
 are
 available,
 which
 one
 do


I
 like,
 which
 what
 kind
 of
 trade-offs


for
 pricing,
 for
 covering,
 etc.
 And
 then


I
 choose
 that
 API
 and
 I
 could
 chain
 APIs


because
 I
 I
 could
 get
 that
 result
 and


look
 up
 a
 etc.
 So
 I
 I
 guess
 this
 is,
 you


know,
 like
 it
 it
 sounds
 pretty
 much


we've
 solved
 this.
 So
 as
 free
 AI,
 we're


going
 to
 solve
 it.
 It'll
 just
 take
 some


time
 and
 who
 knows
 what
 the
 format
 for


it
 will
 be.
 I
 mean
 I
 mean
 I
 built
 make


porter
 which
 is
 a
 which
 is
 a
 a
 small


TypeScript
 thing
 that
 converts
 an
 MCP
 to


a
 CLI.
 So so
 you
 can
 you
 can
 just


package
 it
 up.


>> Basically
 you're
 saying
 CLIs
 right
 now


are
 a
 lot
 more
 efficient.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So
 so
 my
 in
 in
 in
 cloud
 but


I
 don't
 have
 MCP
 support
 but
 you
 can
 we


make
 portal
 you
 can
 use
 any
 MCP
 you
 can


you
 can
 literally
 be
 on
 your
 phone
 and


say
 hey
 use
 the
 use
 the
 versel
 MCP
 to
 do


this
 and
 this
 and
 it
 will
 go
 on
 the


website.
 It'll
 find
 the
 MCP.
 it
 will


load
 it
 and
 it'll
 use
 it
 all
 all
 on


demand.
 Even
 right
 now
 if
 you
 use
 MCP


you
 have
 to
 restart
 cloud
 code
 which
 is


like
 very
 user
 unfriendly.
 So
 I
 quietly


built
 up
 my
 army
 to
 like
 automate


everything
 which
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 work.
 Uh
 I


think
 t
 did
 a
 video
 a
 few
 days
 ago
 where


he
 told
 me
 like
 this
 guy
 is
 insane


because
 the
 list
 is
 really
 long
 by
 now


but
 like
 I
 I
 as
 I
 was
 playing
 with
 my
 my


my
 agent
 I
 just
 I
 want
 him
 to
 do
 more


and
 more
 stuff
 you
 know.
 I
 felt
 it


really
 hard
 to
 convey
 what
 it
 does.
 It's


still
 hard
 to
 me.
 In
 January,
 January


1st,
 just
 a
 week
 now,
 I
 did.
 Okay,
 let's


let's
 try
 something.
 Let's
 let's
 do
 the


ins
 really
 insane
 thing
 of
 like
 making
 a


Discord
 and
 then
 adding
 my
 agent
 to


Discord.
 There
 was
 somebody
 who


contributed
 Discord
 support
 to
 it.
 And


uh
 even
 though
 I
 wasn't
 sure
 if
 I
 should


merge
 it
 and
 I
 eventually
 did.
 So
 I
 put


on
 my
 agent
 who
 has
 full
 read
 write


access
 to
 my
 computer
 in
 a
 public


Discord.


>> What
 could
 possibly
 go
 wrong?


>> Yeah.
 It's
 like
 this
 is
 absolutely


insane.
 And
 then
 of
 course
 like
 some


people
 join
 the
 Discord
 and
 then
 they


saw
 me
 they
 saw
 me
 using
 the
 full
 power


of
 this
 thing
 like
 checking
 my
 cameras


doing
 home
 automation.


It
 playing
 DJ
 for
 me.
 Like
 I
 was
 in
 the


kitchen
 and
 I
 told
 him
 like
 look
 at
 my


screen
 and
 are
 my
 agents
 done
 cuz
 it
 has


full
 access
 of
 my
 clean
 and
 it
 can


click.
 So
 it
 can
 actually
 click
 into
 the


terminal
 and
 type
 for
 me
 and
 like
 it
 can


tell
 me
 your
 codex
 say
 this
 and
 this


because
 it
 just
 sees
 the
 screen.
 I
 mean


I'm
 working
 on
 optimizing
 that
 like
 I
 I


actually
 want
 to
 stream
 out
 it
 because


would
 be
 much
 would
 be
 much
 better
 if


it's
 text
 but
 it
 works
 already
 like
 it


it's
 it's
 in
 the
 background
 it
 look
 at


my
 screen
 and
 like
 make
 some
 rants
 if
 I


do
 some
 [ __ ]
 And
 everybody
 who


experienced
 it
 for
 a
 few
 minutes
 got


hooked.
 Like
 this
 was
 this
 was
 the


craziest
 blow
 up
 from
 100
 stars
 to
 like


what
 3,300
 stars
 in
 a
 week.
 Um
 and
 I


think
 I
 merged
 500
 pull
 requests


already.
 That's
 why
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 even


merge
 button.
 So,
 so
 that
 that's
 why


that's
 why
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 little
 I'm
 a
 little


all
 over
 the
 place
 these
 days
 because


this
 project
 is
 blowing
 off
 and
 and
 and


you
 know
 the
 beauty
 of
 it
 is
 the


technology


disappears.


You
 just
 you
 just
 talk
 to
 a
 a
 friend
 on


your
 phone
 that
 is
 infinitely


resourceful,
 has
 access
 to
 your
 your


email,
 your
 calendar,
 your
 files,
 can


build
 websites
 for
 you,
 can
 like
 do


administrative
 work,
 can
 scrape


websites,
 can
 call
 your
 friends
 or
 can


call
 a
 business.
 I'm
 just
 about
 to
 to
 to


merge
 the
 call
 feature.
 It
 literally
 can


call
 a
 business
 and
 like
 make make
 a


reservation
 for
 you
 and
 you
 don't
 have


to
 think
 about
 compactation
 or
 or
 any


all
 of
 that
 context
 blends
 away.
 I
 have


like
 a
 I
 have
 a
 memory
 system
 that
 will


remember
 um
 not
 perfect.
 Nothing's


perfect
 yet,
 but
 it's
 already
 feels


magical.
 cuz
 all
 cuz
 cuz
 now
 I
 I
 walk


around,
 I
 see
 like
 this
 event,
 I
 I
 send


Claude
 a
 picture,
 it
 will
 it
 will
 not


only
 tell
 me
 the
 reviews
 of
 this
 event,


if
 there's
 a
 conflict
 in
 my
 calendar,
 if


like
 friends
 talked
 about
 it
 or,
 you


know,
 it
 has
 so
 much
 context
 that
 it
 the


responses
 that
 it
 can
 give
 me
 are
 like


so
 much
 better
 than
 like
 what
 any
 of
 the


the
 current
 tools
 that
 live
 in
 their
 own


little
 box
 can
 give
 me.
 Well,
 sounds


like
 you
 built
 whatever
 Apple
 was
 hoping


Siri
 to
 do,
 but
 they've
 been
 unable
 to.


>> I
 honestly
 I
 built
 the
 best
 marketing


tool
 for
 Entropic
 to
 sell
 them
 more


subscription.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 many


people
 signed
 up
 for
 the
 $200


subscription
 because
 of
 Cloudbot
 and


like
 many
 people
 already
 had
 one
 and


used
 a
 second
 subscription
 because
 of


that
 because
 it's
 so
 token
 hungry.
 It's


not
 is
 not
 that
 it's
 token
 hunter.
 It's


just
 that
 people
 love
 it
 so
 much
 that


they
 use
 it
 all
 the
 time.
 And
 because


the
 technology
 blends
 away,
 they
 don't


see
 that
 it
 spawns
 sub
 agents
 and
 does


like
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 things
 in
 the


background
 to
 just
 make
 it
 feel
 easy.


But
 like
 there's
 some
 actual
 engineering


like
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 in
 the
 back


uh
 to
 make
 it
 feel
 easy.
 You
 know,
 this


is
 like
 the
 hard
 part.
 Like
 you
 hide


complexity


to
 a
 degree
 that
 it
 it
 it
 feels
 magical.


Well,
 but
 yeah,
 but
 this
 is
 interesting


because
 like
 I
 I
 I
 can
 sense
 from
 we're


talking,
 you
 know,
 you
 put
 so
 much


thought
 into
 architecting
 this
 thing
 and


right
 now
 like
 you've
 been
 building
 this


for
 a
 few
 months
 and
 yes,
 it
 blew
 up,


but
 in
 your
 head
 like
 do
 you
 have
 a


structure
 of
 how
 CloudBot
 is
 structured


like
 what
 parts
 you
 need
 to
 modify,
 you


know,
 like
 like
 you
 kind
 of
 you
 can
 get


your
 your
 mindset
 into
 it
 and
 you
 you


know
 where
 modification
 needs
 to
 do.
 You


know
 what
 you
 want
 to
 refactor
 because


it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 efficient.
 Are
 you


thinking
 about
 like
 things
 like
 memory


consumption,
 token
 consumption,


efficiency,
 those
 kind
 of
 things?


>> I
 mean,
 token
 consumption
 is
 more
 like


how
 do
 how
 do
 you
 structure
 the
 prompt


and
 memory?


It's
 it's
 TypeScript
 that
 shows
 Jason


around
 in
 the
 end.
 Let's
 be
 honest.
 Like


like
 like
 I
 get
 text
 from
 from
 an
 LLM,


>> I
 save
 text
 to
 to
 disk.
 I
 send
 text
 to


WhatsApp
 or
 to
 now
 we
 have
 like
 MS


Teams,
 Slack,
 Discord,
 uh
 Signal,


iMessage,
 WhatsApp,
 and
 there's
 there's


two
 more
 that
 are
 landing
 like
 Metrics


that
 will
 will
 expand
 this
 thing
 even


further.
 It's
 like
 it's
 it's
 really
 poly


by
 now.
 But
 but
 mostly
 I
 I
 again
 I
 I


move
 around
 text
 in
 different
 shapes
 and


maybe
 maybe
 it
 goes
 to
 different


providers
 or
 there's
 like
 now
 it's


different
 agents
 and
 there's
 like
 the


agentic
 loop
 and
 there's
 like
 a
 lot
 of


configuration
 and
 there's
 it's
 it's
 a


lot
 of
 plumbing
 but
 nothing's
 there's


nothing
 in
 there
 that
 is
 really


difficult.
 Yeah.
 Well,
 but
 it's
 it's
 a


lot
 lot
 of
 small
 things,
 right?
 Like
 I
 I


feel
 in
 software,
 right?
 Like
 we
 we
 know


for
 software
 even
 before
 AI
 there
 was


not
 much
 difficult.
 Of
 course,
 you
 need


to
 learn
 and
 understand
 the
 language
 and


all
 that,
 but


>> the
 difficulty
 is
 how
 do
 I
 how
 do
 I
 make


it
 so
 that
 it
 feels
 magical.
 So,
 so
 what


I
 worked
 on
 a
 lot
 is
 now
 you
 have
 you


have
 this
 oneliner
 that
 you
 type
 in
 that


you
 python
 your
 command.
 I
 will
 I
 will


check
 if
 you
 have
 node
 installed


homebrew
 installed.
 I'll
 I'll
 install


the
 mpm
 package.
 I
 do
 some
 check
 if
 you


have
 any
 existing
 stuff
 just
 to
 like
 y


>> just
 to
 make
 it
 work
 simple
 even
 if
 you


already
 used
 an
 older
 version
 and


everything.
 and
 then
 I
 I'll
 guide
 you


through
 uh
 setting
 up
 a
 model.
 But


again,
 I
 will
 I
 will
 predict


or
 or
 claude
 installed.
 So
 you
 can
 just


press
 enter.
 So
 you
 don't
 have
 have
 to


think
 about
 it.
 Mostly
 just
 press
 enter


and
 then
 you
 want
 a
 WhatsApp,
 you
 type


in
 your
 number,
 it
 will
 just
 work
 again.


And
 then
 and
 then
 I'll
 ask
 you
 do
 you


want
 do
 you
 want
 to
 hatch
 your
 bot?
 And


you
 can
 press
 yes.
 And
 then
 and
 then


like
 a
 TUI
 a
 TUI
 comes
 up
 because
 you're


still
 in
 the
 terminal,
 right?
 You
 want
 a


good
 experience.


>> Yeah.
 So
 just
 a
 toy
 basically
 for
 that


and
 where
 you
 where
 you
 to
 see
 wake
 up


my
 friend
 and
 then
 the
 the
 I
 programmed


the
 model
 I
 added
 a
 bootstrap
 file
 and


the
 to
 explain
 the
 model
 that
 it
 is
 now


being
 born
 to
 like
 create
 an
 identity


and
 a
 in
 a
 in
 a
 in
 a
 soul
 where
 like
 the


values
 of
 the
 user
 are
 in
 and
 then
 the


model
 will
 be
 like
 hello
 like
 stretches


who
 are
 you
 um
 who
 are
 who
 I
 am
 what's


my
 name
 you
 know
 and
 this
 this
 is
 is


like
 I've
 watched
 people
 do
 it
 and


that's
 where
 the
 magic
 starts.
 That's


where
 that's
 where
 they're
 like
 they
 no


longer
 think
 about
 I'm
 talking
 to
 to


GPD4.2.
 No,
 I'm
 now
 talking
 to
 my
 friend


created
 Vajorn
 like
 a
 a
 unicorn
 with


part
 of
 his
 name
 or
 like
 I'm
 talking
 to


Claude.
 Uh
 and
 then
 it's
 like
 what


what's
 important
 to
 you?
 What
 do
 you
 do?


It's
 like
 curious.
 I
 I
 programmed
 it
 to


be
 like
 curious
 and
 then
 go
 through
 this


bootstrapping
 phase
 and
 then
 it
 will


actually
 delete
 the
 bootstrap
 file
 and


create
 a
 a
 user.md
 with
 like
 information


about
 you
 a
 soul.md
 with
 like
 all
 the


core
 values
 and
 an
 identity
 with
 the


like
 what's
 his
 name
 what's
 his
 core


emoji
 what
 are
 the
 things
 that
 are
 like


inside
 jokes
 and
 and
 but
 it's
 like


evolving
 documents
 that
 it
 will
 maintain


and
 like
 tweak
 as
 you
 interact
 with
 it


and
 then
 you
 it
 will
 just
 like
 send
 you


a
 message
 on
 on
 WhatsApp
 and
 you
 just


like
 suddenly
 you
 talk
 on
 WhatsApp
 like


making
 this
 flow
 easy.
 That
 was
 hard.


Yeah.
 Also
 like
 even
 even
 get
 coming
 up


with
 the
 idea
 of
 you
 know
 you
 you're
 not


you're
 not
 editing
 the
 configuration


because
 the
 agent
 can
 edit
 its
 own


configuration.
 You
 don't
 have
 to
 update


anything
 because
 the
 agent
 can
 update


itself.
 You
 can
 literally
 ask
 your
 bot


update
 yourself
 and
 it
 will
 fetch
 itself


and
 update
 itself
 and
 come
 back
 like
 hey


I
 have
 new
 features.
 Planning
 the


technical
 giveaway
 so
 far
 that's
 the


magic.
 That's
 why
 that's
 why
 I


>> But
 it
 feels
 it's
 very
 similar
 to
 what


you
 would
 with
 PSP
 PDF
 cut,
 right?
 You


kind
 of
 blended
 away
 the
 complexity
 of
 a


PDF.
 So
 it
 was
 just
 there.
 You
 could


rotate,
 you
 could
 do.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Even
 at
 the
 API
 level
 back


then,


>> but
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 bit
 bizarre
 like
 what


what
 you
 described
 reminds
 me
 of
 this


Black
 Mirror
 episode
 I
 just
 watched,


which
 is
 called
 Play
 Thing.
 uh
 where


it's
 a
 it's
 a
 digital
 little
 uh
 creature


that
 creates
 of
 course
 it's
 black
 mirror


so
 it
 has
 a
 black


>> bit
 bit
 of
 a
 dark
 ending
 but
 but
 it
 it


had
 it
 was
 also
 a
 game.
 It
 also
 kind
 of


feels
 you
 know
 we
 talked
 about
 how
 you


you
 don't
 play
 as
 much
 games
 cuz
 you


like
 but
 this
 also
 feels
 a
 little
 bit


like
 a
 game,
 right?
 But
 it
 it's
 it's


kind
 of
 like
 more
 connected
 with


reality.
 Just
 fascinating
 how
 we're


we're we're
 here
 pulling
 back
 into
 the


the
 realm
 of
 of
 software
 engineering.
 So


you
 built
 this
 this
 product
 and
 it's
 now


it's
 a
 production
 software
 you're


merging
 porocas
 people
 are
 using
 it
 now


thinking
 back
 to
 PSPDF
 kit
 and
 and


companies
 that
 are
 like
 that
 which
 which


have
 you
 know
 like
 like
 tens
 or
 hundreds


of
 developers
 working
 on
 on
 production


software
 knowing
 what
 you
 know
 with
 how


you're
 building
 cloudbot
 and
 the
 tools


that
 you're
 using
 how
 do
 you
 think


software
 engineering
 at
 those
 larger


companies
 could
 change
 because
 one
 one


thing
 I
 see
 is
 is
 for
 individual
 people


like
 you
 it's
 like
 AI
 I
 is
 really
 really


hitting
 a
 fit
 like
 you're
 making
 you
 way


more
 productive.
 You're
 in
 control
 at


teams
 or
 at
 companies
 that
 are
 you
 know


have
 existing
 code.
 It's
 just
 a
 lot
 kind


of
 slower.
 It's
 it's
 not
 really
 okay


people
 use
 it
 for
 this
 or
 that
 but
 but


it
 it
 seems
 a
 huge
 divide
 between
 the


two
 worlds.
 And
 you've
 kind
 of
 been
 you


know
 CEO
 for
 this
 company.
 What
 what


might
 that
 be
 or
 is
 it
 just
 more
 of
 a


timing
 thing
 where
 every
 new
 technology


often
 comes
 with
 with
 hobists
 you
 know


pick
 it
 up
 uh
 earlier?
 I
 think
 companies


will
 have
 a
 really
 hard
 time
 adopting
 AI


efficiently
 because
 this
 also
 requires


to
 completely
 redefine
 how
 the
 company


works.
 You
 know,
 you
 know,
 you
 know
 like


you
 know
 like
 at
 Google
 they
 they
 tell


you
 you
 can
 either
 be
 an
 engineer
 or


like
 a
 manager
 but
 or
 you
 want
 to
 also


like
 define
 how
 the
 UI
 looks.
 That
 role


doesn't
 exist
 because
 either
 you
 like


you
 you
 build
 it
 or
 you
 you
 design
 it.


But
 this
 new
 world
 needs
 people
 that


that
 have
 a
 a
 product
 vision
 that
 that


that
 can
 be
 able
 to
 do
 everything
 and


you
 need
 like
 far
 fewer
 of
 them,
 but


ultimately


just
 very
 high
 agency
 and
 and
 and
 high


competency
 people.
 But
 you
 can
 you
 can


like
 probably
 like
 trim
 the
 company
 down


to
 like
 30%.
 Which
 is
 very
 scary
 because


like
 I
 mean
 economically
 this
 will
 all


this
 will
 all
 lead
 into
 a
 fiasco.
 Um,


and
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 will
 like
 have


trouble
 finding
 a
 a
 place
 in
 this
 new


world,
 but


I'm
 not
 the
 least
 surprised
 that
 current


companies
 cannot
 very
 successfully
 use


AI.
 I
 mean,
 they
 do
 to
 a
 degree,
 but
 you


you
 have
 to
 do
 a
 big
 refactor
 first,
 you


know,
 like
 not
 just
 on
 your
 codebase,


but
 also
 on
 your
 company.
 I
 design
 even


on
 code
 bases
 I
 design
 the
 codebase
 not


so
 it's
 it's
 useful
 it's
 easy
 for
 me
 so


that
 it
 has
 to
 be
 easy
 for
 the
 agent
 I


optimize
 for
 different
 things
 not
 always


the
 things
 that
 I
 prefer
 but
 the
 things


I
 know
 work
 the
 best
 and
 and and
 have


the
 the
 least
 friction
 for
 those
 models


because
 I
 just
 want
 to
 move
 faster
 and


ultimately
 they
 have
 to
 deal
 with
 the


code
 not
 me
 I
 had
 I
 deal
 with
 the
 the


overall
 structure
 and
 architecture
 and
 I


can
 still
 do
 that
 in
 the
 way
 that
 I
 like


everything
 has
 to
 be
 resold
 you
 know


pull
 requests
 uh
 I
 see
 them
 more
 as


prompt
 requests
 Now,
 like
 I
 don't
 I
 I


somebody
 opens
 a
 pull
 request,
 I
 don't
 I


lot
 I
 do
 say
 thanks
 and
 I
 think
 about


the
 feature
 and
 then
 with
 my
 agent
 we


start
 off
 with
 the
 PR
 and
 then
 I'll


design
 the
 feature
 as
 I
 see
 fit.
 The


agent
 rarely
 reuses
 like
 maybe
 I
 reuse


some
 code
 but
 it's
 more
 like
 it
 gives


the
 agent
 a
 good
 understanding
 of
 what


the
 goal
 is
 and
 sometimes
 it's
 very


useful
 because
 it's
 it's
 tricky
 bucks,


right?
 But
 I
 I
 basically
 rewrite
 every


pull
 request
 and
 and
 and
 v
 it
 in
 also


also
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 let's
 just
 say
 the


overall
 code
 quality
 of
 of
 PRs
 went
 down


a
 lot
 because
 people
 vibe
 code
 and
 and


building
 a
 successful
 feature
 still


needs
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 understanding
 of


your
 overall
 design
 and
 if
 you
 if
 you


cannot
 do
 that
 you
 will
 have
 a
 harder


time
 steering
 your
 agent
 and
 the
 output


will
 be
 bad.


>> Yeah.
 And
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 the
 feedback


loop
 to
 close
 it
 etc.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 so
 I
 found
 it
 highly


effective.
 Like
 I
 know
 at
 my
 at
 at
 PSVDF


kit
 sometimes
 a
 pull
 request
 was
 like
 a


week
 in
 the
 work


>> and
 you
 comment
 on
 it
 and
 then
 somebody


has
 to
 context
 switch
 and
 you
 wait
 for


CI
 for
 40
 minutes.
 No,
 I
 have
 the


discussion.
 I
 see
 okay
 how
 would
 this


affect
 something
 like
 I
 I
 I
 let
 the


model
 review.
 They
 will
 already
 bring


something
 up.
 I
 have
 some
 some
 ideas
 as


well.
 We're
 going
 to
 reshape
 it
 into
 a


form
 that
 fits
 my
 vision
 and
 then


we
 weave
 in
 the
 code.
 It's
 literally


there's
 so
 many
 new
 words
 I
 use
 for
 like


writing
 code
 now
 with
 those
 models
 which


is
 so
 funny
 like
 weaving
 in
 code
 into
 an


existing
 structure.
 Um
 and
 sometimes
 you


have
 to
 like
 change
 the
 structure
 so
 it


would
 fit.
 Now
 imagine
 that
 you
 would


hire
 one
 or
 two
 people
 to
 make
 it
 a


small
 team.
 How
 do
 you
 think
 in
 this


world
 and
 you
 keep
 want
 to
 keep
 doing


what
 you're
 doing?
 How
 do
 you
 think


things
 like
 code
 review
 CI
 CD
 would


change?


>> I
 don't
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 care
 much
 about


CI.
 I


>> Why
 why
 not?
 you
 used
 to
 care
 a
 lot
 like


a
 PSPDF
 kid.
 You
 used
 to
 care
 a
 lot,


right?


>> And
 and
 I
 still
 do
 this.
 There's
 value,


>> but
 I
 I
 have
 local
 CI.
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 little


bit
 I'm
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 DAH
 now
 that


>> because
 because
 the
 agent
 runs
 the
 test,


right?


>> Yeah.
 And
 it's
 just
 way
 faster.
 I
 don't


I
 want
 to
 push
 on
 the
 on
 on
 the
 on
 the


back
 on
 the
 P
 and
 then
 wait
 for
 10


minutes
 to
 wait
 for
 for
 CI


>> because
 you
 waited
 10
 minutes
 on
 the


agent
 already.
 I
 if
 if
 the
 tests
 pass


locally,
 we
 merge
 and
 then
 yes,


sometimes
 main
 slips
 a
 little
 bit,
 but


it's
 it's
 it's
 usually
 very
 close


because
 maybe
 sometimes
 I
 forget
 the
 and


the
 agents
 call
 it
 gate.
 I
 don't
 know


where
 that's
 coming
 from.
 Should
 I
 run


full
 gate?
 So
 now
 I
 call
 it
 gate
 with
 g


full
 gate
 is
 like
 linting
 and
 building


and
 and
 checking
 and
 running
 all
 the


tests.
 And
 I
 almost
 think
 it
 like


because
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 wall,
 you
 know,


like
 it's
 like
 he
 calls
 the
 llinter
 and


like
 the
 builder
 and
 the
 tester.
 It's


almost
 like
 a
 gate
 before
 my
 code
 goes


out.
 So
 I
 know
 obviously
 like
 okay
 once


you're
 done
 like
 commit
 this
 run
 full


gate
 like
 I'm
 I'm
 slowly
 adopting
 their


language
 but
 but
 and
 if
 you
 hired
 like


one
 more
 person
 to
 work
 on
 this
 you


probably
 wouldn't
 do
 code
 reviews


either.
 That's
 what
 I'm
 sensing.
 You


would
 you'll
 probably
 trust
 this
 person


to
 run
 like
 like
 pick
 up
 your
 working


style,
 right?


>> Even
 in
 Discord,
 we
 don't
 we
 don't
 talk


code.
 We
 talk
 about
 architecture
 like


big
 decisions
 like
 you
 still
 need
 to


have
 style.
 Like
 there
 was
 like
 this
 one


pull
 request
 that
 adds
 voice
 calling.
 So


now
 like
 literally
 I
 can
 tell
 Claude,


hey,
 can
 you
 call
 this
 restaurant
 and


and
 and
 and
 reserve
 your
 seats
 and
 and


it
 it
 it
 can
 do
 that.
 But
 it
 it
 it's
 a


big
 it's
 quite
 a
 big
 new
 module
 that


like
 touches
 a
 lot
 of
 places.
 I'm
 like


you
 have
 to
 have
 this
 feeling
 is
 like


this
 like
 I
 got
 a
 little
 this
 is
 like
 I


want
 to
 merge
 this
 but
 oh
 this
 is


becoming
 bloatware.
 So
 I
 so
 I
 I
 had
 this


idea
 of
 like
 uh
 let's
 my
 typical
 way


let's
 make
 a
 CLI
 out
 of
 it
 and
 I
 already


had
 a
 project
 where
 I
 tried
 to
 solve


something
 like
 this
 but
 I'm
 finished.
 So


I
 opened
 up
 Codex
 and
 said,
 "Hey,
 look


at
 this
 PR.
 Look
 at
 this
 project.
 Could


we
 weave
 this
 feature
 in?"
 I
 again
 say


weave.
 I'm
 like,
 "So
 I'm


>> let's
 keep
 it.


>> Could
 we
 weave
 this
 feature
 into
 the


CLI?
 What
 are
 the
 up
 and
 downsides?"
 And


then
 would
 like
 tell
 me
 like,
 "Oh
 yeah,


I
 could
 do
 this
 and
 this
 and
 this."
 They


give
 me
 honest
 opinion.
 Would
 this
 to
 me


this
 sounds
 like
 it
 actually
 it
 would


fit
 into
 the
 project?
 I
 was
 like,
 and


was
 like,
 "Yeah,
 you
 would
 get
 this
 and


this
 benefits
 that
 we
 cannot
 do
 if
 the


next
 CLI."
 Okay,
 but
 I
 don't
 like
 this.


This
 is
 getting
 blowware.
 could
 we
 build


a
 plug-in
 architecture
 and
 then
 I
 will


and
 do
 you
 know
 like
 one
 of
 the
 the


secret
 hacks
 on
 on
 on


using
 effectively
 is
 you
 reference
 other


products
 like
 I
 constantly
 tell
 it
 look


into
 this
 folder
 because
 I
 solved
 it


there
 and
 I
 solved
 that
 there
 and
 all


the
 previous
 thinking
 I
 did
 to
 like


solve
 a
 problem
 well
 AI
 is
 so
 good
 at


this
 still
 to
 like
 read
 the
 code
 and


understand
 my
 ideas
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 like


explain
 it
 again
 uh
 or
 if
 I
 explained


again
 I
 might
 like
 make
 mistakes
 that


like
 wouldn't
 get
 across
 was
 exactly
 the


idea
 that
 I
 have
 in
 my
 head.


>> So
 in
 this
 case,
 I
 know
 that
 Mario
 who


does
 like
 shitty
 coding
 shitty
 coding


agent
 which
 is
 like
 a
 actually
 very
 much


not
 shitty
 coding
 agent.
 It's
 called
 Pi.


I
 know
 that
 he
 had
 this
 plug-in


architecture
 that
 would
 load


>> code
 via
 via
 GT
 and
 because
 it's
 all


TypeScript.
 So
 I
 was
 like,
 can
 you
 look


into
 this
 folder
 and
 this
 folder?
 And


then
 it
 just
 came
 up
 with
 this
 really


insanely
 good
 plug-in
 architecture
 again


by
 like
 being
 inspired
 by
 the
 people.


And
 then
 that's
 why,
 you
 know,
 I
 have


this
 feeling
 and
 then
 I
 I
 came
 up
 with


Yeah,
 that's
 what
 I
 built
 last
 night


basically.
 I
 mean,
 sounds
 like
 this
 is


going
 to
 be
 completely
 different
 like


you
 know
 PRs
 are
 are
 like
 in
 your


workflow,
 you're
 not
 using
 PRs
 that
 much


as
 CI
 is
 just
 different.
 It's
 it's
 tests


are
 still
 doing
 there's
 an
 more


important
 feedback
 loop.
 you're
 using


things
 more
 like
 weaving
 instead
 of


code.
 You're
 talking
 more
 about


architecture
 and
 taste.
 It
 sounds
 like
 a


pretty
 big
 shift
 to
 me.
 Now,
 in
 this


world,
 let's
 assume
 you
 get
 to
 the
 point


where
 you're
 going
 to
 you're
 hire
 the


next
 one
 and
 two
 and
 three
 developers
 on


this
 team.
 Let's
 imagine
 that
 this
 thing


gets
 a
 life
 of
 its
 own
 and
 you
 know,


maybe
 it's
 a
 business
 as
 well.
 What


skills
 would
 you
 look
 for?
 And
 what


would
 you
 advise
 a
 an
 experienced


engineer
 right
 now?
 Who
 would
 you
 be


excited
 to
 work
 with?
 kind
 of
 either


expertise


projects
 would
 you
 look
 for
 for
 someone


who
 sounds
 like
 who
 can
 work
 in
 this
 way


or
 can
 pick
 up
 this
 way
 of
 working?


>> Someone
 who's
 active
 on
 GitHub
 and
 does


open
 source
 and
 and
 someone
 where
 I
 have


the
 feeling
 that
 they
 they
 love
 the
 the


game.
 The
 way
 you
 learn
 in
 this
 new


world
 is
 by
 like
 trying
 stuff
 and
 it


very
 much
 feels
 like
 a
 game
 where
 you


improve
 your
 skills
 as
 you
 get
 better


like
 like
 a
 like
 a
 music
 instrument.
 you


have
 to
 like
 keep
 trying
 and
 I
 and
 I


that
 I'm
 now
 this
 efficient
 and
 this


fast
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 like
 I
 I
 think


like
 the
 other
 day
 I
 had
 like
 600


commits
 in
 a
 single
 day.
 this
 is
 like


completely
 nuts
 and
 it
 works
 like
 it's


not
 it's
 not
 like
 there
 was
 there
 was
 a


somebody
 did
 a
 code
 review
 and
 said
 like


oh
 this
 is
 actually
 not
 slop
 and
 like


yeah
 uh


>> there's
 a
 lot
 of
 skill
 that
 went
 into


>> yeah
 it's
 it's it's
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 hard


work
 but
 you
 need
 to
 play
 with
 the


technology
 and
 learn
 and
 then
 you
 will


get
 in
 the
 beginning
 it
 might
 be


frustrating
 I
 don't
 know
 kind
 of
 like


you
 you
 know
 you
 start
 going
 to
 the
 gym


it's
 going
 to
 suck
 it's
 going
 to
 be


painful


but
 very
 quickly
 you
 like
 you
 get
 better


and
 you
 and
 you
 feel
 that
 that
 your


workflow
 gets
 faster
 and
 then
 you
 feel


the
 improvements
 and
 then
 you
 slowly
 get


hooked.
 So
 So
 but
 yeah,
 play
 and
 and


yeah,
 also
 work
 hard.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 mean
 you're
 putting
 in
 more


hours
 into
 this
 thing.


>> I've
 never
 right
 now
 I've
 I've
 never
 I


never
 worked
 more
 even
 even
 when
 I
 had


my
 company.
 I
 I've
 never
 worked
 so
 hard


as
 I
 do
 now.
 Not
 because
 I
 have
 to,
 but


because
 it's
 so
 addictive
 and
 so
 much


fun,
 but
 also
 because
 right
 now
 I'm
 like


using
 the
 moment
 where
 where
 this
 has


traction
 and
 and
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people


who
 like
 are
 pushing
 me.
 Um,
 and
 I
 I


feel
 could
 it
 be
 cuz
 I
 think
 you
 have


pretty
 good
 business
 sense.
 Not
 not
 not


necessarily
 in
 the
 business
 business,


but
 seeing
 when
 there's
 an
 opportunity


there
 is
 an
 opening
 for
 to
 get
 traction,


right?
 Like
 what
 you
 said
 for
 people
 to


work
 in
 the
 open
 right
 now
 it
 seems


novel.
 You're
 telling
 me
 you
 don't
 think


you
 could,
 even
 if
 you
 wanted
 to
 hire,


you
 don't
 think
 you
 could
 hire
 people


cuz
 there's
 not
 many
 people
 working
 in


the
 open,
 clearly
 using
 these
 things.


Fast
 forward
 2
 or
 3
 years
 from
 now,
 once


a
 bunch
 of
 people
 start
 to
 do
 it
 and


everyone
 does
 it,
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 moot


a
 little
 bit.
 So
 there
 there's
 also
 that


a
 group
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 lot
 of
 people
 are


worried
 about
 is
 the
 the
 new
 grads,
 the


the
 people
 with
 with
 no
 experience
 who


are
 either
 in
 school
 or
 about
 to


graduate
 because
 of
 course
 you've
 been


an
 experienced
 engineer
 by
 the
 time
 this


came
 around.
 you
 know,
 you
 have a
 lot
 of


things
 to
 build
 on.
 Putting
 that


yourself
 into
 shoes
 of
 of
 someone
 like


that
 and
 knowing
 what
 you
 know
 now,
 what


would
 you
 recommend
 of
 of
 activities


that
 they
 do,
 things
 that
 they
 build
 or


try
 and
 you
 know
 like
 do
 would
 you


recommend
 on
 focusing
 on
 the


fundamentals
 of
 software
 engineering
 on


this
 on
 the
 agents
 kind
 of
 mixing
 the


two?


>> I
 would
 I
 would
 recommend
 them
 to
 be


infinitely
 curious.
 Yes,
 it's
 going
 to


be
 harder
 to
 enter
 this
 market.
 It's


it's
 absolutely
 going
 to
 be
 harder
 and


you
 need
 to
 build
 things
 to
 like
 gain


experience.
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 need
 to


write
 a
 lot
 of
 code
 but
 you
 need
 to
 I


don't
 know
 you
 know
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


open
 source
 that
 is
 complex
 that
 you
 can


like
 check
 out
 and
 learn
 and
 you
 have
 an


infinitely
 patient
 machine
 that
 is
 able


to
 explain
 you
 all
 the
 things
 so
 you
 can


ask
 you
 can
 ask
 all
 questions
 why
 why


was
 it
 built
 this
 way
 to
 like
 gain


system
 understanding
 but
 it
 requires


real
 curiosity
 and
 I
 don't
 think


universities
 right
 now
 are
 set
 up
 to


teach
 you
 that
 in
 a
 in
 in
 a
 really
 good


way
 this
 is
 usually
 something
 you


discover
 through
 pain
 it's
 it's
 not


going
 to
 be
 easy
 for
 new
 people,
 but
 but


they
 have
 they
 have
 the
 benefit
 that


they
 are
 not
 tainted
 by
 all
 the


experience
 like
 they
 they they
 use


agents
 in
 ways
 that
 we
 don't
 even
 think


about
 again
 because
 they
 don't
 know
 that


it
 doesn't
 work
 and
 by
 then
 it
 probably


does


>> and
 also
 their
 friends
 use
 it
 all
 all


the
 time


>> especially
 like
 like
 the
 other
 day
 I
 I


have
 this
 little
 menu
 bar
 app
 for
 cost


tracking
 on
 on
 on
 on
 cursor
 and
 and and


cloud
 code
 and
 everything
 and
 it
 was
 a


bit
 slow.
 So
 I
 I
 was
 like,
 "Okay,
 let's


do
 let's
 do
 performance
 measurement."


And
 and
 my
 old
 way
 is
 like
 I
 open


instruments
 and
 click
 around.
 And
 it


would
 just
 call
 and
 do
 everything
 by
 the


terminal.
 It
 blew
 me
 away.
 I
 was
 like
 I


didn't
 even
 have
 to
 open
 instruments


anymore.
 And
 it
 just
 like
 made
 it


faster.
 And
 then
 did
 like
 some


recommendations.
 I'm
 like
 all
 of
 that


sounds
 good.
 Do
 it.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 think
 we
 might
 be


underestimating
 both
 like
 how


resourceful
 people
 entering
 tech
 have


been
 also
 how
 young
 people
 if
 I
 think


about
 some
 of
 the
 great
 companies


started
 they
 were
 very
 young
 and


obviously
 very
 inexperienced
 but
 had
 a


lot
 of
 passion
 so
 so
 that's
 there
 as


well
 yeah
 it's
 it's
 a
 big
 opportunity
 I


I'm
 especially
 taking
 in
 like
 it's
 I


have
 to
 take
 it
 in
 like
 but
 all
 the


things
 you
 mentioned
 about
 just
 your
 way


you
 know
 weaving
 code
 in
 not
 caring


about
 PR
 not
 caring
 about
 code
 reviews


it's
 a
 big
 change
 because
 these
 things


have
 been
 us
 with
 like
 again
 for
 like
 15


plus
 years
 of
 your
 life
 they
 have
 been


in
 fact
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 has
 been


kind
 of
 you
 know
 solid
 building
 blocks


of
 PSPDF
 kit
 right
 yeah
 we
 need
 we
 need


a
 lot
 of
 new
 things
 even
 you
 know
 even


when
 I
 get
 a
 PR
 I'm
 actually
 more


interested
 in
 the
 prompts
 than
 in
 the


code
 I
 I
 ask
 people
 to
 please
 add
 the


prompts
 and
 some
 do
 and
 I
 I
 read
 the


prompts
 more
 than
 I
 read
 the
 code


because
 to
 me
 this
 is
 this
 is
 a
 way


higher
 signal
 of
 like
 how
 did
 you
 get
 to


the
 solution
 what
 did
 you
 actually
 ask


how
 much
 steering
 was
 involved
 then
 the


actual
 out
 to
 me
 this
 gives
 me
 more
 idea


about
 the
 output
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 read


the
 code
 or
 like
 if
 someone
 wants
 a


feature
 I
 ask
 for
 a
 prompt
 request
 like


write
 it
 up
 really
 well
 because
 then
 I


can
 just
 point
 my
 agent
 to
 the
 issue
 and


it
 will
 build
 it
 so
 because
 because
 the


the
 work
 is
 the
 thinking
 about
 how
 it


should
 work
 and
 what
 the
 details
 are
 and


if
 someone
 else
 does
 it
 for
 me
 I
 can


literally
 say
 build
 and
 it
 will
 work
 uh


and
 I
 and
 then
 yeah
 of
 course
 I
 think


about
 But
 it
 will
 will
 re
 really
 or
 if


someone
 sends
 me
 a
 PR
 that
 are
 just
 a


few
 fixes.
 I
 told
 people
 please
 don't
 do


that.
 It
 takes
 me
 10
 times
 more
 time
 to


to
 review
 that
 and
 just
 type
 in
 fix
 in


in
 in
 codex
 and
 wait
 a
 few
 minutes.
 So


there's
 there
 like
 all
 these
 insane


things
 that
 are
 like
 would
 have
 been


completely
 different


>> even
 even
 at
 the
 beginning.
 uh
 now
 we


have
 a
 oneliner
 but
 for
 the
 last
 two


weeks


like
 when
 it
 got
 really
 traction
 I
 told


people
 to
 just
 just
 point
 an
 agent
 at


the
 repository
 to
 configure
 it
 so
 so
 I


didn't
 had
 I
 didn't
 have
 an
 onboarding


but
 we
 had
 cloud
 codebased
 onboarding


where
 claude
 would
 like
 check
 out
 the
 G


repository
 read
 the
 things
 and
 write
 the


configuration
 for
 those
 people
 and
 set


everything
 up
 so
 it
 works
 like
 set
 up
 a


launch
 agent
 that
 didn't
 have
 the
 manual


setup
 because
 it
 was
 not
 a
 priority


anymore
 because
 because
 agents
 can
 now


do
 that
 for
 you
 and
 the
 and
 the
 and


since
 the
 the
 product
 was
 built
 by


agents.
 They
 structured
 it
 exactly
 the


way
 agents
 expect
 things
 to
 be
 named
 and


things.
 There's
 certain
 ways
 that
 are


encoded
 in
 in
 in
 the
 in
 the
 weights
 how


they
 expect
 things
 to
 be
 named
 and


everything
 exactly
 like
 how
 they
 expect.


So
 they
 are
 really
 good
 at
 navigating


their
 product.
 So
 it
 was
 not
 a
 priority


to
 work
 on
 onboarding
 as
 much.
 I
 mean


eventually
 I
 wanted
 this
 magical


experience
 but
 it
 was
 more
 important
 to


like
 make
 sure
 that
 your
 message
 arrives


and
 that
 things
 don't
 explode.
 So


onboarding
 was
 literally
 like
 type
 this


prompt
 into
 your
 agent.
 Um
 which
 is


would
 have
 been
 mind-blowing
 even
 a
 year


ago.


>> All right.
 So
 to
 to
 wrap
 up,
 we'll
 do


some
 rapid
 questions.
 So
 I'll
 just
 ask


and
 you
 tell
 me
 what's
 on
 your
 mind.


What's
 a
 tool
 that
 is
 not
 a
 CLI,
 not
 an


ID,
 it
 can
 be
 physical
 that
 you
 you
 use


you
 like
 you
 would
 recommend?
 I
 buy
 a


lot
 of
 gadgets
 and
 many
 of
 them
 dust


away.
 But
 there's
 this
 one
 kind
 of


crappy
 thing
 that
 was
 not
 expensive
 that


gives
 me
 almost
 unlimited
 amount
 of
 joy.


And
 it's
 like
 this
 Android
 powered
 photo


stand
 where
 I
 can
 upload
 pictures
 and


where
 like
 it
 has
 an
 email
 address
 and


friends
 can
 send
 pictures
 and
 it
 will


just
 show
 pictures.
 And
 I
 and
 I
 put
 a


few
 a
 few
 in
 in
 my
 house
 again.
 And
 I


mean
 even
 the
 animations
 are
 a
 little


croppy
 because
 it
 runs
 nward
 and
 it's


terrible
 from
 the
 technology
 but
 but
 it


gives
 me
 infinite
 number
 of
 joy
 because


it
 is
 low
 tech
 that
 just
 shows
 pictures


and
 reminds
 me
 of
 happy
 moments
 in
 my


life
 and
 it
 was
 like
 200
 bucks
 and
 I


don't
 know
 to
 be
 honest
 that
 gets
 me


more
 joy
 than
 the
 latest
 iPhone.
 I


bought
 the
 iPhone
 17.
 I
 still
 haven't


unpacked
 it
 because
 I
 just
 in
 my
 head
 I


wanted
 it
 but
 then
 I
 couldn't
 get
 around


to
 it
 because
 it's
 just
 a
 hassle
 to
 like


move
 the
 Sims
 around
 and
 I
 said
 like


basically
 no
 no
 no
 no
 feelable
 benefit


but
 like
 this
 little
 this
 little
 device


gives
 me
 infinite
 joy.


>> What's
 something
 that
 helps
 you
 recharge


outside
 of
 tech
 like
 just
 or
 just
 moving


away
 from
 from
 tech
 and
 screens?
 What


keeps
 me
 sane,
 even
 if
 I
 work
 crazy


hours,
 is
 going
 to
 the
 gym,
 even
 better,


working
 with
 a
 a
 coach
 and
 leaving
 my


phone
 in
 the
 locker.
 And
 then
 I
 really


have
 like
 a
 good
 hour
 where


I
 just
 feel
 me
 and
 I
 and
 I'm
 like
 in
 the


moment
 and
 I'm
 not
 distracted
 by


notifications
 or
 tempted
 to
 like
 touch


my
 phone
 like
 we
 need
 more
 time
 for


this.
 Or
 even
 sometimes
 I
 I
 I
 go
 for
 a


walk
 and
 I
 I
 leave
 my
 phone
 at
 home
 and


it
 feels
 very
 scary.
 It's
 almost
 like
 a


it's
 almost
 like
 an
 organ
 now,
 you
 know?


It's
 like
 your
 your
 body
 knows
 where
 it


is
 and
 if
 you
 don't
 know
 where
 your


phone
 is,
 you
 freak
 out.


>> I
 I'm
 having
 I'm
 having
 a
 blast.


>> Love
 it.
 This
 is
 great,
 Pete.
 Thanks


very
 much.
 Well,
 this
 was
 a
 super


interesting
 conversation
 and
 it
 feels
 to


me
 that
 how
 one
 person
 teams
 built


software
 with
 AI
 is
 already
 completely


different
 to
 what
 we've
 been
 used
 to.


One
 thing
 that
 really
 caught
 my


attention
 is
 how
 Peter
 thinks
 in
 prompts


and
 not
 pull
 requests
 and
 how
 he
 weaves


in
 the
 code
 and
 no
 longer
 merges
 the


code.
 He
 doesn't
 find
 poll
 requests
 all


that
 useful
 and
 would
 rather
 get
 prompt


suggestions
 even
 on
 GitHub.
 I
 do
 think


we
 might
 have
 to
 rethink
 the
 importance


of
 prompts
 or
 at
 the
 very
 least
 sharing


of
 prompts
 in
 software
 development
 the


more
 we
 use
 AI
 and
 AI
 agents.
 Another


thing
 that
 struck
 with
 me
 was
 Peter's


emphasizing
 how
 important
 is
 to
 close


the
 loop.
 As
 Peter
 explained,
 the
 reason


AI
 is
 so
 good
 at
 coding
 but
 often


mediocre
 at
 writing
 is
 because
 you
 can


validate
 code.
 You
 can
 compile
 it,
 run


tests,
 check
 the
 output.
 So,
 the
 secret


to
 making
 AI
 system
 development
 work


well
 is
 to
 design
 your
 system
 to
 close


the
 loop
 and
 have
 the
 AI
 run
 the
 test.


Finally,
 I
 was
 wondering
 if
 Peter
 is
 in


the
 flow
 as
 much
 even
 when
 he's
 not


writing
 code.
 Turns
 out
 he
 is.
 He's
 in


the
 flow
 more
 than
 ever.
 And
 he
 told
 me


that
 it's
 mentally
 more
 exhausting
 to


juggle
 several
 AI
 agents
 in
 parallel


than
 it
 was
 just
 to
 write
 code.
 My


feeling
 is
 that
 someone
 who
 was
 a
 great


developer
 without
 AI
 can
 be
 an
 excellent


kind
 of
 code
 architecture
 or
 carding


person
 with
 AI.
 This
 is
 just
 a
 gut


feeling
 I've
 had
 so
 far,
 but
 Peter
 seems


to
 prove
 it.
 Finally,
 we
 should
 note


that
 Clawbot
 is
 more
 of
 a
 YOLO
 project


than
 most
 production
 apps.
 So,
 take
 the


approaches
 that
 we
 discussed
 with
 a


grain
 of
 salt.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 I
 do


think
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 Peter
 does


could
 well
 spread
 to
 building
 production


code,
 except
 review
 and
 validation
 will


become
 a
 much
 more
 important
 step
 in


those
 projects.
