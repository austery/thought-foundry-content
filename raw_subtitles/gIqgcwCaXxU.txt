My
 country
 is
 Venezuela
 and
 my
 name
 is


Jan
 Rodriguez.


>> My
 name
 is
 Juan
 and
 I'm
 in
 Karakas
 in


the
 capital.


>> My
 name
 is
 Karolina
 Hill.
 I
 live
 near


the
 most
 important
 military
 complex
 here


in
 Venezuela.


early
 January
 3rd.
 It
 was
 like
 uh
 1:57


a.m.
 and
 I
 was
 watching
 a
 movie
 with
 my


sister
 and
 everything
 went
 completely


dark
 and
 5
 seconds
 later
 we
 heard
 the


first
 explosion.


I
 ran
 to
 the
 window
 to
 take
 a
 look
 at


what
 was
 going
 on.
 My
 hands
 were


shaking.
 I
 could
 only
 see
 the
 light
 of


the
 moon
 and
 we
 could
 hear
 the
 airplanes


and
 we
 could
 hear
 the
 helicopters
 but
 we


couldn't
 see
 them


and
 the
 walls
 of
 my
 building
 and
 the


windows
 were
 shaking.


I
 thought
 now
 the
 gringo
 are
 here.
 They


are
 attacking
 Karakas.


>> Everybody
 in
 the
 city
 heard
 the
 noises.


I
 think
 we
 were
 nervous
 but
 at
 the
 same


time
 excited
 because
 we
 thought
 they


were
 overthrowing
 the
 government.
 They


were
 freeing
 us
 from
 the
 dictatorship.


Like
 my
 girlfriend
 and
 I
 were
 crying
 and


screaming.
 I
 called
 my
 mom.
 I
 called
 my


brothers.
 Like
 I
 called
 all
 my
 family.


We
 were
 waiting
 for
 that
 for
 years.


>> When
 Donald
 Trump
 put
 up
 the
 picture


with
 Maduro


capture,
 I
 am
 so
 happy
 in
 that
 moment.


Oh
 my
 god,
 man.
 Honestly,
 I
 cry
 for
 that


picture.
 It's
 finished
 that
 this
 hell.


This
 felt
 like
 a
 real
 victory.
 Like


someone
 in
 this
 government
 that
 has
 done


so
 much
 damage
 to
 my
 country
 is
 going
 to


finally
 face
 real
 justice.


after
 this
 attack
 we
 were
 like
 okay
 they


did
 it
 but
 what's
 the
 meaning
 of
 that


what
 will
 come
 for
 us
 I
 mean
 what
 what's


the
 next
 step
 because
 okay
 they
 took
 mro


out
 but
 we
 have
 we
 have
 padrino
 lopez
 we


have
 Rodriguez
 I
 mean
 they
 are
 still


here


>> other
 people
 government
 is
 free
 I
 am


confused
 the
 future
 in
 Venezuela
 really


really


[Music]


And
 the
 people
 don't
 know
 what
 will


happen.
 The
 people
 is
 so
 scared.
 It's
 so


scared.


From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Natalie


Kitroof.
 This
 is
 the
 Daily.


On
 Monday,
 as
 Nicholas
 Maduro
 and
 his


wife
 Celia
 pleaded
 not
 guilty
 in
 a


Manhattan
 courtroom,
 the
 nearly
 30


million
 people
 of
 Venezuela
 struggled
 to


absorb
 the
 reality
 of
 a
 post-maduro
 era.


An
 era
 in
 which
 the
 United
 States


appears
 to
 be
 the
 dominant
 force


reshaping
 their
 once
 firmly


anti-American
 government.


Today,
 my
 colleague
 Anatoli
 Kermanay


explains
 why
 President
 Trump
 chose
 to


back
 a
 Maduro
 loyalist
 to
 run
 the


country
 and
 what
 Venezuelans
 think
 of
 it


all.


It's
 Tuesday,
 January
 6th.


>> Hi,
 Anatoli.
 Welcome.
 It's
 good
 to
 have


you
 here.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me,
 Natalie.


So,
 in
 the
 last
 couple
 of
 days,
 we
 at


the
 show
 have
 talked
 about
 how
 this


operation
 to
 capture
 Nicholas
 Maduro


went
 down.
 We've
 talked
 about
 the


legality
 of
 it.
 What
 we
 haven't
 talked


about
 as
 much
 is
 who
 is
 running


Venezuela
 right
 now
 and
 how
 is
 all
 of


that
 going
 to
 play
 out
 because
 that


feels
 very
 uncertain
 in
 this
 moment.


You've
 been
 in
 the
 country
 as
 this
 all


has
 been
 going
 on
 through
 the
 mission


itself.
 You're
 in
 Karacus
 right
 now.
 So,


just
 to
 start,
 how
 does
 it
 feel
 there?


>> It
 feels
 surreal.
 You
 know,
 the
 city
 is


still
 coming
 out
 of
 Christmas
 holidays.


It's
 a
 metropolis
 of
 more
 than
 4
 million


people
 and
 it's
 full
 of
 lights
 and


decorations.
 And
 I
 was
 driving
 through


the
 city
 last
 night
 and
 the
 city
 was


completely
 deserted.
 You
 know,
 there
 was


not
 a
 single
 soul
 on
 the
 streets.
 Uh,
 no


sounds
 to
 be
 made.
 It
 felt
 like
 I
 was
 in


a
 zombie
 movie.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 just
 sums


up
 this
 atmosphere
 of
 expectation,
 of


fear,
 of
 concern.
 It's
 just
 tense.
 We


have
 not
 seen
 mass
 signs
 of
 jubilation


at
 the
 fall
 of
 Nicholas
 Maduro.
 At
 the


same
 time,
 we
 had
 not
 seen
 any
 genuine


mass
 outpourings
 of
 grieving
 for
 him
 and


his
 wife.
 And
 this
 atmosphere
 of
 quiet


tension
 is
 taking
 place
 amid
 growing


signs
 of
 repression,
 of
 people
 being


detained,
 of
 journalists
 being
 harassed,


which
 shows
 to
 me
 that
 even
 though
 this


government
 has
 a
 new
 face,
 the
 brutal


repressive
 apparatus
 that
 has
 kept
 it
 in


power
 for
 decades
 remains
 in
 place
 and


is
 cracking
 down
 again.
 It
 sounds
 like


everyone
 in
 Venezuela
 is
 just
 kind
 of


waiting
 with
 baited
 breath
 for
 what's
 to


come.
 So,
 let's
 get
 into
 that.
 And
 my


first
 question
 is,
 is
 what
 we're
 seeing


actually
 regime
 change?
 Because
 now
 that


the
 dust
 has
 settled
 a
 little
 bit,
 it


seems
 as
 though
 the
 regime
 is
 actually


still
 in
 power
 in
 Venezuela.


>> That's
 right,
 Natalie.
 The
 regime
 is
 in


place.
 The
 people
 who
 are
 no
 longer
 here


is
 Maduro
 and
 his
 wife
 and
 around
 80


people
 have
 died
 between
 his
 Cuban


bodyguards
 and
 Venezuelan
 civilians,


Venezuelan
 security
 service
 members.
 But


beyond
 that,
 we
 are
 seeing
 the
 same
 cast


of
 characters.
 Most
 of
 his
 inner
 circle


is
 intact.
 It
 is
 in
 power
 and
 is
 led
 by


Deli
 Rodriguez,
 known
 universally
 as


Deli,
 who
 was
 Madura's
 vice
 president,


who
 was
 the
 first
 in
 line
 to
 replace
 him


under
 any
 circumstances.
 So
 the
 same


characters
 uh
 ruling
 the
 country.


>> Okay.
 So
 Deli
 Rodriguez,
 the
 vice


president
 now
 in
 power,
 is
 someone
 that


Trump
 has
 endorsed.
 The
 administration


says
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 working


directly
 with
 her.
 And
 I
 want
 to
 talk


about
 why.
 Why
 her?
 Because
 honestly,


when
 you
 and
 I
 have
 talked
 about
 this,


the
 most
 obvious
 choice
 for
 who
 was


going
 to
 work
 with
 the
 Trump


administration
 in
 the
 event
 that
 Maduro


was
 no
 longer
 in
 power
 was
 someone
 else.


It
 was
 Maria
 Karina
 Machado,
 this
 famous


opposition
 leader.
 So
 explain
 for
 me,


Anatoli,
 why
 it's
 not
 Machado
 and
 why


it's
 Deli
 instead.


>> The
 short
 answer
 is
 continuity.
 Trump


wanted
 to
 stop
 the
 flood
 of
 drugs
 from


Venezuela.
 He
 wanted
 to
 stop
 migrants,


but
 above
 all,
 he
 made
 it
 very
 clear
 he


wanted
 Venezuelan
 oil.
 And
 Dela


Rodriguez
 has
 been
 able
 to
 sell
 herself


as
 a
 reliable
 guardian
 of
 Venezuela's


oil
 industry
 as
 a
 person
 who
 can
 manage


Venezuela
 resources
 and
 protect
 foreign


interests
 which
 in
 this
 case
 will
 be


American
 investor
 interests.


>> And
 Machado
 was
 not
 able
 to
 sell
 herself


as
 that
 figure.


>> She
 was
 not
 and
 this
 is
 perhaps
 the


biggest
 surprise
 of
 this
 theme.
 Machado


is
 by
 far
 the
 most
 popular
 politician
 in


the
 country.
 She
 has
 led
 an
 election


campaign
 in
 2024
 that
 has
 led
 more
 than


70%
 of
 Venezuelans
 to
 vote
 for
 the


opposition
 and
 she
 has
 won
 the
 Nobel


Peace
 Prize
 for
 her
 efforts.
 She
 has


global
 recognitions
 and
 global
 respect


and
 she
 comes
 with
 impeccable


conservative
 credentials.
 She's
 a


daughter
 of
 a
 wealthy
 industrialist.
 She


has
 an
 impeccable
 record
 of
 supporting


free
 markets,
 of
 supporting
 personal


freedom,
 supporting
 Christian
 faith,
 all


values
 at
 the
 heart
 of
 traditional


Republican
 agenda.
 But
 she's
 a
 product


of
 a
 different
 period
 of
 American


politics.
 And
 Machado's
 gravest
 mistake


was
 not
 being
 able
 to
 adapt
 to
 the


transformation
 that
 Trump
 has
 brought
 to


the
 American
 right.


>> What
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 that
 exactly?
 Well,


the
 adjective
 that
 defines
 Machado
 more


than
 anything
 else
 is
 consistency.
 She


has
 been
 extremely
 consistent
 in
 her


beliefs.
 She
 has
 been
 extremely


consistent
 her
 political
 agenda.
 And


this
 consistency
 is
 what
 brought
 her
 to


the
 cost
 of
 gaining
 power
 in
 Venezuela


during
 the
 last
 elections.
 This
 is
 the


reasons
 why
 she
 has
 galvanized


Venezuelan
 populations
 because
 people


believed
 in
 her.
 They
 believed
 in
 her


values.
 they
 believed
 in
 what
 she
 stood


for
 and
 that
 she
 would
 defend
 them,
 that


she
 would
 not
 negotiate
 with
 Madura,


that
 she
 would
 not
 sell
 them
 out.
 This


consistency
 was
 at
 its
 core.
 But
 in
 the


current
 transactional
 Washington
 of


today,
 this
 has
 become
 a
 liability.
 she


has
 not
 been
 able
 to
 adjust
 to
 uh
 a
 very


transactional
 approach
 to
 politics
 that


we
 see
 in
 Washington.
 A
 ideologically


agnostic
 approach
 to
 Washington
 where


beliefs
 and
 policies
 are
 are
 ditched
 and


sacrificed
 and
 adjusted
 on
 daily
 basis


to
 suit
 the
 the
 whims
 of
 people
 taking


power.
 And
 this
 has
 gradually
 led
 her
 to


lose
 allies
 and
 make
 a
 growing
 number
 of


enemies
 in
 the
 Trump
 administration,


which
 eventually
 has
 contributed
 to
 her


being
 sidelined
 at
 this
 crucial
 moments


in
 Venezuelan
 history.


>> Okay.
 Can
 you
 go
 a
 little
 deeper
 there?


Like
 give
 me
 examples
 of
 how
 she
 wasn't


able
 to
 adjust.


>> So,
 for
 example,
 when
 Trump
 returns
 to


power,
 his
 initial
 focus
 on
 Venezuela
 is


getting
 Americans
 detained
 there,
 out
 of


jail,
 and
 back
 into
 the
 United
 States.


and
 he
 sends
 his
 envoy,
 he
 sends
 a
 man


called
 Richard
 Grenell,
 a
 businessman


and
 former
 ambassador
 to
 Germany
 to


Caracus
 to
 negotiate
 the
 deal.
 And
 then


Grenell
 arrives
 in
 Karacas.
 He
 reaches


out
 to
 Machado
 because
 she's
 the


representative
 of
 Venezuelan
 opposition.


She's
 seen
 at
 the
 time
 as
 representative


of
 American
 interest.
 And
 he
 starts
 a


dialogue.
 That's
 a
 relationship
 that


very
 quickly
 goes
 off
 rails
 because


getting
 Americans
 out
 means
 talking
 to


Madura's
 government
 means
 negotiating.


Negotiating
 is
 an
 anthema
 for
 Maria


Karina
 Machado.
 She
 has
 argued
 for


decades
 that
 freedom
 is
 not
 negotiable,


that
 democracy
 is
 not
 negotiable,
 that


there
 can
 be
 no
 compromises.
 And
 that


set
 the
 stage
 for
 a
 train
 wreck
 between


Richard
 Grenell
 and
 Maria
 Karina


Machado.
 a
 clash
 that
 has
 repeated


itself
 over
 and
 over
 throughout
 the


Trump
 administration
 as
 she
 lost


national
 allies
 and
 created
 new
 enemies.


>> You're
 saying
 basically
 Machado
 is
 such


a
 purist
 that
 she's
 totally
 opposed
 to


any
 notion
 of
 negotiating
 with
 Maduro


and
 this
 alienated
 Trump's
 lead


negotiator
 in
 Venezuela
 who's
 there
 to


try
 to
 get
 a
 deal.


>> He
 was
 there
 to
 try
 to
 get
 a
 deal
 and


he's
 there
 to
 get
 economic
 deals.
 to


start
 negotiating
 a
 deal
 with
 Maduro's


officials
 that
 would
 see
 Maduro
 hand


over
 Venezuelan
 resources
 in
 return
 for


him
 staying
 in
 power
 at
 least
 for
 the


time
 being.
 Again,
 this
 goes
 completely


against
 everything
 that
 Machado
 has


stood
 for.
 And
 over
 time,
 in
 the
 months


since
 the
 election,
 as
 Venezuelan


government
 stepped
 up
 repression,


Machado's
 movement
 became
 increasingly


marginalized
 in
 Venezuelan
 political


life.


>> They
 increasingly
 had
 to
 flee
 in
 exile.


Machado
 herself
 had
 to
 go
 into
 hiding.


They
 have
 gradually
 lost
 touch
 with
 what


is
 happening
 on
 the
 streets
 in
 Venezuela


and
 their
 uncompromising
 position
 meant


they
 had
 very
 few
 contacts
 inside


Venezuelan
 government.
 So
 then
 the
 Trump


administration
 they
 have
 gradually
 come


to
 realize
 that
 the
 strategies
 that


Machado
 and
 her
 aids
 were
 providing
 to


Washington
 were
 outdated
 were
 were
 not


accurate
 and
 the
 intelligence
 or
 you


know
 the
 assumptions
 being
 made
 by
 the


opposition
 have
 proved
 wrong
 time
 and


again
 and
 this
 has
 angered
 officials
 in


the
 Trump
 administration
 that
 were


trying
 to
 work
 out
 a
 credible
 plan
 of


getting
 Maduro
 out
 of
 power.
 So
 it


sounds
 like
 they
 start
 to
 sour
 on
 her
 in


part
 because
 they
 don't
 believe
 she's


giving
 valuable
 intel.
 And
 that's


despite
 the
 fact
 that
 as
 we
 know
 in


recent
 months,
 Machado
 was
 really
 doing


everything
 she
 could
 to
 kind
 of


ingratiate
 herself
 with
 the
 Trump


administration
 as
 they
 began
 to
 dial
 up


the
 pressure
 on
 Maduro.
 She
 even


dedicated
 her
 Nobel
 Peace
 Prize
 to


Trump.
 I
 guess
 all
 that
 wasn't
 enough.


>> All
 that
 wasn't
 enough.
 And
 to
 me,


there's
 a
 certain
 tragic
 element
 to
 this


because
 this
 is
 a
 politician
 with


impeccable
 moral
 credentials.
 Machado


has
 built
 her
 presidential
 campaign
 on


the
 focus
 on
 Venezuelan
 migrants,
 of


reuniting
 Venezuelan
 families,
 of


returning
 the
 millions
 of
 Venezuelans


that
 have
 fled
 the
 country
 from
 Maduro,


bringing
 them
 back
 home.
 And
 since
 Trump


took
 power,
 she
 has
 stopped
 talking


about
 Venezuelan
 migrants
 cuz
 these
 are


the
 people
 that
 Trump
 was
 arresting.


Trump
 was
 deporting,
 Trump
 was
 jailing


in
 in
 foreign
 jails
 where
 we
 were


tortured.
 And
 Machado
 stayed
 silent
 as


flights
 into
 the
 country
 were
 gradually


cancelled
 under
 American
 pressure.
 She


stayed
 silent.
 As
 inflation
 rose
 under


tightening
 American
 sanctions,


complicating
 people's
 daily
 life,
 she


has
 stayed
 silent.
 And
 this
 has
 caused
 a


political
 capital
 inside
 the
 country.


She
 has
 sacrificed
 a
 lot
 of
 political


goodwill
 that
 she
 has
 built
 inside


Venezuela
 to
 please
 this
 one
 man.
 She


has
 gone
 out
 of
 her
 way
 to
 praise
 him.


She
 has
 published
 opads
 saying
 that


Trump
 is
 the
 greatest
 defender
 of


freedom
 in
 the
 western
 hemisphere.
 It


was
 very
 clear
 to
 everyone
 observing


Venezuela
 that
 Machado
 is
 speaking
 to


the
 audience
 of
 one
 and
 her
 entire


strategy
 has
 been
 on
 bringing
 Trump
 to


her
 side
 and
 so
 far
 she
 has
 failed.


>> You
 know,
 Trump
 said
 in
 this
 big
 press


conference
 he
 gave
 over
 the
 weekend
 that


Machado
 just
 didn't
 have
 the
 support
 in


Venezuela.
 So,
 was
 that
 actually
 true


based
 on
 what
 you
 just
 said?
 credible


polling
 in
 Venezuela
 is
 very
 limited,


but
 the
 evidence
 we
 have
 shows
 that
 her


popular
 support
 has
 been
 gradually
 very


slowly
 sipping
 away
 from
 a
 very
 high


point.
 Crucially
 for
 Trump,
 when
 he
 says


that
 she
 doesn't
 have
 a
 respect,
 he
 is


talking
 about
 respect
 of
 the
 people
 that


would
 make
 it
 possible
 for
 her
 to


govern.
 And
 Machado's
 inflexibility
 and


focus
 on
 pressure
 rather
 than


negotiation
 has
 meant
 that
 she
 has
 lost


the
 support
 of
 the
 Solo's
 economic


elites
 that
 have
 traditionally
 supported


the
 opposition
 and
 she
 has
 not
 been
 able


to
 gain
 the
 support
 of
 the
 armed
 forces


that
 she
 herself
 has
 constantly
 said
 are


crucial
 to
 removing
 Maduro.
 She
 has


again
 to
 please
 Trump
 she
 has
 gone
 out


of
 her
 way
 to
 mimic
 his
 talking
 point


that
 Venezuelan
 government
 is
 a
 narco


cortel.
 She
 has
 mimicked
 his
 language


that
 Maduro
 is
 flooding
 United
 States


with
 drugs
 and
 criminals.
 And
 this
 has


meant
 that
 for
 the
 officers
 watching
 her


speeches,
 for
 the
 members
 of
 the


governments,
 for
 the
 people
 that


actually
 make
 the
 state
 tick
 and
 hold


the
 guns,
 that
 she
 was
 painting
 them
 as


members
 of
 an
 Aarco
 cartel,
 as
 part
 of
 a


problem,
 as
 people
 that
 need
 to
 be


eliminated
 from
 Venezuela's
 public
 life.


and
 the
 dissonance
 between
 her
 calls
 for


the
 armed
 forces
 and
 government


employees
 to
 rise
 up
 against
 Maduro
 and


the
 way
 she
 has
 branded
 them
 as
 members


of
 an
 ARO
 cartel
 ended
 up
 spelling
 her


political
 downfall
 inside
 the
 Venezuelan


political
 system.


So,
 ironically,
 in
 order
 to
 align


herself
 with
 Trump,
 Machado
 starts


saying
 these
 things
 that
 actually


alienate
 all
 these
 elites
 within


Venezuela
 that
 she
 actually
 needs
 to


have
 on
 board
 in
 order
 to
 persuade
 the


Trump
 administration
 that
 she's
 a
 viable


candidate
 to
 run
 the
 country.
 Is
 that


right?


>> That's
 right.
 That's
 exactly
 what


happened.
 These
 are
 people
 that
 have


been
 in
 charge
 for
 a
 very
 long
 time.
 And


it
 the
 Trump
 administration
 became


convinced
 that
 to
 get
 the
 country


running
 quickly
 to
 keep
 it
 stable,
 to


keep
 it
 from
 collapsing
 and
 sending


hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 migrants
 to
 its


borders,
 to
 keep
 the
 oil
 flowing
 to
 the


United
 States,
 to
 boost
 that
 flow
 of


oil,
 they
 needed
 to
 work
 with
 people
 who


were
 already
 in
 charge.


And
 that's
 why
 we
 picked
 DelC
 over
 Maria


Karina
 Machado.


This
 is
 the
 great
 irony
 of
 a
 current


political
 drama
 that
 Deli
 despite
 of
 her


Marxist
 roots,
 despite
 being
 the


handpicked
 protetéé
 of
 a
 person
 labeled


as
 a
 naroterrorist
 by
 the
 United
 States,


despite
 playing
 a
 crucial
 part
 in
 the


repressive
 machine,
 the
 White
 House
 has


decided
 that
 she
 is
 the
 most
 likely


candidate
 among
 the
 available
 options
 to


bring
 Venezuela
 into
 the
 American
 sphere


of
 influence.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Okay,
 let's
 talk
 about
 Venezuela's
 new


leader,
 who,
 as
 you
 said,
 everyone
 calls


Deli.
 She
 sounds
 like
 an
 unlikely
 choice


for
 the
 Trump
 administration
 in
 many


ways
 to
 support.
 explain
 who
 she
 is
 and


what
 the
 Trump
 administration
 sees
 in


her.


>> First
 and
 foremost,
 they
 see
 Deli
 as
 a


capable
 economic
 manager
 and
 that


reputation
 that
 she
 has
 earned
 has
 come


at
 the
 end
 of
 a
 very
 unexpected
 journey.


[Music]


She
 is
 a
 daughter
 of
 a
 Marxist
 gerilla


who
 was
 tortured
 by
 the
 security
 forces


of
 previous
 pro-American
 governments


during
 the
 cold
 war.
 So
 she
 comes
 from
 a


background
 of
 impeccable
 socialist


credentials
 but
 they
 also
 come
 from


money


>> and
 she
 enjoyed
 quite
 a
 privileged


upbringing.
 She
 went
 to
 university
 in


France
 and
 she
 joined
 the
 government,


the
 current
 regime
 under
 the
 wings
 of


her
 older
 brother
 going
 up
 in
 the
 ranks


of
 a
 chavismo
 government.
 And
 that
 rise


really
 accelerated
 around
 2019
 when


Venezuela
 is
 facing
 tremendous
 economic


pressure
 from
 United
 States
 that
 had


just
 sanctions
 its
 oil
 industry.
 The


revenues
 have
 collapsed.
 The
 Maduro


government
 has
 struggled
 to
 just
 keep


the
 lights
 on
 in
 the
 country.
 And
 Maduro


turns
 to
 Deli
 and
 basically
 tells
 her
 to


fix
 it.


>> And
 what
 does
 she
 do?
 Does
 she
 fix
 it?


>> She
 completely
 re-engineers
 Venezuelan


economy.
 She
 and
 a
 group
 of
 technocrats


allied
 to
 her
 began
 a
 process
 that
 in
 a


very
 short
 period
 discarded
 the


socialist
 tropes
 that
 the
 government
 had


based
 its
 legitimacy
 on
 for
 many
 years,


price
 controls,
 currency
 controls,
 focus


on
 the
 needs
 of
 Venezuelan
 poor,
 and


turned
 it
 into
 a
 free-for-all
 market


economy
 where
 money
 ruled
 and
 investment


was
 the
 only
 merit.


[Music]


It's
 so
 interesting
 that
 the
 daughter
 of


a
 Marxist
 became
 this
 trusted
 steward
 of


something
 approaching
 capitalist
 reform.


>> Well,
 in
 many
 ways,
 you
 know,
 Venezuela


is
 an
 extremely
 corrupt
 country
 and
 it


is
 as
 corrupt
 today
 as
 it
 was
 under
 the


nominally
 socialist
 principles.
 But
 in


terms
 of
 actual
 policies,
 Deli
 has


turned
 Venezuela
 into
 a
 radically


capitalist
 society.
 That
 there's


practically
 no
 regulation,
 that
 there


are
 practically
 no
 rules,
 that
 money
 is


the
 only
 variable
 that
 that
 governs


society
 and
 and
 governs
 the
 interaction


between
 the
 states
 and
 its
 citizens.


>> But
 did
 it
 work
 though?
 Like
 did
 it


stabilize
 the
 economy,
 which
 is
 what


Maduro
 was
 originally
 asking
 for?
 It
 did


work
 and
 led
 to
 a
 period
 of
 moderate


growth.
 Starting
 in
 2021,
 the
 inflation


subsided.
 People
 started
 to
 open
 up


businesses.
 People
 started
 to
 travel


more.
 The
 oil
 production
 began
 to


gradually
 edge
 up.
 And
 remember,
 Natalie


that
 this
 has
 all
 started
 from
 a
 very


low
 base.
 We're
 not
 talking
 about
 uh


Dubai
 of
 Latin
 America,
 but
 we're


talking
 about
 a
 country
 that
 had


suffered
 a
 tremendous
 economic
 collapse


where
 millions
 have
 fled
 where
 that


people
 have
 suffered
 from
 malnutrition


and
 it
 gave
 them
 a
 modiccom
 of
 economic


stability.


>> Okay.
 So,
 it
 sounds
 like
 the
 reforms


that
 Deli
 helped
 engineer,
 they
 didn't,


you
 know,
 bring
 wealth
 back
 on
 mass
 to


Venezuelans,
 but
 they
 did
 write
 the


economic
 ship.
 They
 helped
 stanch
 the


bleeding.
 Did
 that
 do
 anything
 to
 help


the
 regime's
 standing
 with
 Venezuelans?


I
 mean,
 obviously,
 they
 still
 voted
 for


the
 opposition
 in
 the
 last
 election.
 So,


I
 would
 imagine
 the
 answer
 is
 no,
 right?


>> The
 answer
 is
 no.
 And
 the
 elections
 of


2024
 have
 proven
 that
 the
 government
 had


gone
 out
 of
 its
 way
 to
 sell
 itself
 to


Venezuelans
 as
 we
 are
 stability.
 The


opposition
 is
 chaos.
 Stick
 with
 us.
 You


can
 live
 with
 us.
 You
 can
 breathe
 with


us.
 And
 still
 more
 than
 70%
 of


Venezuelans
 including
 massive


proportions
 of
 public
 sector
 workers
 and


the
 poor
 voted
 for
 the
 opposition
 voted


for
 the
 candidate
 of
 Maria
 Karina


Machado
 showing
 just
 the
 scale
 of


exhaustion
 and
 repulsion
 that
 this


population
 has
 against
 President
 Maduro.


>> And
 what
 about
 the
 elites
 that
 we
 talked


about
 earlier?
 How
 do
 they
 see
 Deli
 in


all
 of
 this?
 Delta's
 reforms
 gave
 him


space
 to
 to
 grow,
 gave
 him
 space
 to


invest.
 Again,
 not
 talking
 about
 massive


investments.
 We're
 not
 talking
 about


tremendous
 growth
 for
 talking
 about
 a


climate
 where
 people
 that
 have
 money
 can


start
 making
 more
 money.
 And
 Machado's


message
 is
 overhauling
 this
 completely,


scrapping
 this
 whole
 system
 is
 is


starting
 from
 scratch.
 And
 business


wants
 stability
 and
 they
 turn
 against


Machado's
 message
 of
 radical
 change.


It's
 really
 interesting,
 right?
 Because


Machado
 in
 many
 ways
 is
 a
 more
 natural


ally
 of
 theirs
 too,
 right?
 She
 comes


from
 this
 family
 they
 probably
 know,


this
 industrialist.
 She
 has
 these


impeccable
 credentials
 as
 a
 free
 market


capitalist.
 And
 yet
 here
 she's
 the
 one


with
 the
 broad-based
 popular
 support


who's
 lost
 the
 support
 of
 these
 elites.


While
 Deli
 doesn't
 have
 that
 popular


support,
 it
 sounds
 like,
 but
 she
 has
 one


over
 this
 group
 of
 business
 titans
 that


is
 still
 incredibly
 influential
 in
 this


country.


>> This
 is
 a
 fundamental
 paradox,
 Natalie.


I
 could
 not
 have
 summarized
 it
 better.


Uh,
 and
 I
 think
 all
 it
 just
 goes
 to
 show


that
 economic
 freedoms
 do
 not
 always


correlate
 with
 political
 freedoms.
 And


the
 reality
 is
 that
 for
 Trump,
 what


matters
 to
 him
 is
 the
 deals
 and
 the


investment
 of
 the
 elites.
 And
 that
 has


led
 him
 to
 gradually
 ally
 with
 Deli,
 the


the
 self-styled
 technocrat
 who
 could


bring
 him
 Venezuelan
 riches
 over
 Maria


Kurim
 Machado
 who
 was
 promising


political
 liberation
 but
 a
 very
 volatile


and
 unstable
 economic
 environment.
 Okay,


so
 now
 I
 think
 I
 get
 why
 Deli
 is


preferable
 to
 Machado
 in
 the
 eyes
 of


Trump.
 What
 I
 still
 don't
 understand


though
 is
 why
 Deli
 is
 preferable
 to


Maduro
 because
 you've
 told
 us
 Anatoli


the
 few
 times
 that
 you've
 come
 on
 to


talk
 about
 this
 that
 Maduro
 was
 actually


happy
 to
 let
 the
 US
 into
 Venezuela's
 oil


fields
 to
 give
 up
 those
 natural


resources
 as
 part
 of
 a
 potential
 deal


with
 Trump.
 Why
 did
 Trump
 reject
 that


only
 to
 go
 for
 what
 sounds
 like
 a
 very


similar
 deal
 with
 Deli?


>> I
 don't
 think
 we
 have
 perfect
 clarity
 to


that
 question
 at
 the
 moment,
 Natalie.
 My


hunch
 is
 that
 the
 campaign
 against


Maduro,
 the
 campaign
 to
 brand
 a
 narot


terrorist
 and
 a
 cartel
 chief
 who
 is
 at


war
 with
 the
 United
 States
 has
 gone


simply
 too
 far
 for
 Trump
 to
 tolerate
 him


and
 make
 a
 deal
 with
 him.
 Remember
 that


while
 oil
 is
 the
 driving
 force
 of


Trump's
 policy
 towards
 Minnesota,
 it's


not
 the
 only
 one,
 right?
 And
 there
 are


advisers
 within
 his
 administration,


there
 are
 people
 in
 in
 his


administration
 that
 are
 pushing
 towards


our
 goals.
 Uh
 there's
 Steven
 Miller
 with


his
 focus
 on
 migration
 and
 uh
 illegal


drugs.
 There's
 Secretary
 of
 State
 Marco


Rubio
 who
 has
 been
 a
 declared


anti-communist
 warrior.
 These
 people


have
 been
 sworn
 enemies
 of
 Maduro.
 And


as
 Maduro
 repeatedly
 rebuffs
 Trump


administration's
 attempts
 to
 provide
 him


a
 soft
 lensing,
 to
 provide
 him
 a
 golden


parachute,
 Trump's
 position
 hardens
 and


by
 December
 his
 patience
 finally
 snaps.


Maduro's
 response
 to
 increasingly


explicit
 ultimatums
 from
 America
 was
 to


present
 himself
 as
 a
 carefree
 patier.


He
 constantly
 dances
 on
 television.


>> He
 sings
 no
 crazy
 war.


>> You
 know,
 he's
 he's
 a
 good
 dancer.
 You


know,
 he
 he
 puts
 up
 the
 moves
 and
 you


know,
 he
 does
 on
 regular
 basis


>> and
 at
 some
 point
 Trump
 snaps.


Wait,
 are
 you
 saying
 Anatoli
 that
 Maduro


dancing
 on
 national
 television
 is
 an


actual
 factor
 here
 in
 everything
 that


ends
 up
 happening?


>> My
 understanding
 it
 was
 the
 stroll
 that


broke
 the
 camel's
 back.


>> Meaning
 what
 exactly?
 That
 Trump
 saw


Maduro
 dancing
 and
 said,
 "This
 guy's
 not


taking
 me
 seriously."
 Or
 what?
 meaning


that
 Trump
 saw
 the
 ongoing
 dancing
 as
 a


humiliation
 as
 Maduro
 calling
 Trump's


bluff
 as
 Maduro
 telling
 Trump
 I'm
 here


and
 I'm
 here
 for
 as
 long
 as
 I
 want
 to
 be


and
 Trump
 could
 not
 tolerate
 what
 he
 saw


as
 a
 personal
 affront.


>> Wow.
 We
 are
 truly
 living
 in
 wild
 times.


>> Remember
 I
 mean
 Natalie,
 history
 is


often
 made
 by
 seemingly
 sort
 of
 small


banal
 circumstances,
 right?
 It's
 a


accumulation
 of
 major
 factors,
 major


forces
 like
 oil,
 migration,
 drugs.
 But


you
 know,
 it
 can
 be
 something
 as
 sort
 of


small
 as
 a
 little
 techno
 dance
 on
 a


public
 stage
 that
 can
 tilt
 the
 scares


towards
 a
 momentous
 policy
 decision
 that


will
 change
 the
 history
 of
 Western


Hemisphere
 perhaps
 forever.
 Okay,
 we'll


have
 plenty
 of
 time
 to
 talk
 about
 that


future,
 but
 for
 now,
 the
 Trump


administration
 is
 counting
 on
 Deli.
 And


this
 is
 someone
 who
 in
 the
 last
 few
 days


has
 come
 out
 very
 strongly
 against
 them.


It's
 worth
 saying.
 She
 said
 Maduro
 is


the
 only
 president
 of
 Venezuela.
 She


refers
 to
 herself
 as
 the
 vice
 president.


And
 I'm
 wondering
 what
 we
 should
 make
 of


that.
 I
 know
 that
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of


people
 from
 the
 regime
 that
 are
 still
 in


power
 in
 the
 country
 and
 I
 wonder
 if


this
 is
 her
 playing
 to
 them
 to
 that


domestic
 audience.
 She
 has
 to
 appease


them.
 Right.


>> That's
 right.
 Remember
 that
 the
 attack


was
 a
 major
 humiliation
 to
 the
 armed


forces
 and
 security
 officials
 that
 form


the
 core
 of
 Maduro's
 regime.
 It
 was
 an


operation
 that
 cost
 the
 life
 of
 80


people
 uh
 causing
 major
 destructions
 in


capital
 Karacas.
 Deli
 could
 not
 just


sort
 of
 wave
 this
 off
 and
 open
 her
 arms


to
 Americans.
 You
 know,
 she
 has
 to


satisfy
 the
 domestic
 audience.
 She
 has


to
 show
 to
 the
 ruling
 parties
 faithful


who
 are
 not
 numerous
 in
 numbers
 but
 who


hold
 a
 lot
 of
 guns
 that
 she's
 not
 an


American
 porn
 that
 she's
 someone
 who


will
 defend
 the
 country's
 sovereignty


someone
 who
 will
 defend
 the
 the


country's
 standing
 while
 at
 the
 same


time
 she
 has
 to
 satisfy
 American


demands.
 You
 know
 the
 Trump


administration
 and
 his
 officials
 have


repeatedly
 stated
 that
 Deli
 must
 do


their
 bidding
 or
 else
 she
 will
 face
 the


same
 fate
 as
 Maduro.
 So
 she's
 trying
 to


play
 for
 both
 audiences
 and
 as
 you
 said


she
 started
 off
 making
 very
 sort
 of


aggressive
 remarks
 towards
 America
 but


just
 in
 a
 matter
 of
 days
 in
 a
 matter
 of


hours
 her
 position
 has
 softened.
 She
 has


issued
 a
 statement
 calling
 for


corporations
 with
 the
 United
 States
 for


peaceful
 coexistence
 for
 working


together
 for
 joint
 business
 ventures
 and


just
 let
 it
 sink
 for
 you
 Natalie.
 This


is
 a
 statement
 towards
 the
 government


that
 has
 just
 blown
 up
 your
 capital
 and


killed
 80
 people
 living
 in
 the
 capital


and
 you
 are
 basically
 opening
 your
 arms


to
 their
 investments
 and
 to
 bilateral


relations.


>> No,
 it's
 totally
 remarkable
 and
 it
 makes


me
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 about
 what
 this
 means


for
 the
 Chavista
 movement
 that
 has
 been


in
 power
 now
 for
 almost
 three
 decades
 in


Venezuela.
 This
 is
 a
 movement
 that
 has


staked
 its
 legacy
 on
 being
 an


anti-American
 bull
 work.
 What
 happens
 to


that
 legacy
 if
 Deli
 follows
 through
 and


really
 does
 become
 a
 willing
 partner
 of


the
 Trump
 administration?


>> To
 me,
 Natalie,
 the
 events
 of
 the
 past


few
 days
 exposed
 the
 hollowess
 of
 the


nationalist


rhetoric
 behind
 the
 Chavisma
 movement.


At
 the
 time
 when
 the
 country
 came
 under


the
 attack,
 no
 one
 was
 prepared
 to


defend
 President
 Maduro.
 There
 was
 no


notable
 resistance
 from
 Yam
 forces.
 And


to
 me,
 this
 peels
 another
 layer
 of


mysticism
 and
 ideology
 from
 the


movements
 that
 over
 the
 years,
 over
 the


decades,
 this
 movement
 has
 gradually


lost
 the
 the
 pillars
 of
 its
 ideology.


First
 it
 lost
 the
 populist
 support,
 then


it
 lost
 the
 socialist
 credentials.
 Now


it
 loses
 nationalism.
 And
 what
 is
 laugh


Natalie?
 Survival.
 Survival
 is
 the
 core


aspects
 of
 chisbo
 movements.
 And
 the


senior
 officials
 who
 have
 been
 at


Maduro's
 side
 for
 years
 and
 have
 now


closing
 ranks
 behind
 LC
 are
 focused
 on


survival
 at
 any
 cost.


>> And
 at
 I
 want
 to
 end
 by
 just
 asking
 how


the
 Venezuelans
 you're
 talking
 to
 are


perceiving
 all
 of
 this,
 how
 they're


feeling
 right
 now.
 I
 have
 to
 imagine


that
 the
 many
 people
 who
 voted
 against


Maduro
 are
 happy
 that
 he's
 gone
 on
 the


one
 hand
 and
 yet
 the
 regime
 that
 he
 led


is
 still
 very
 much
 there.
 And
 not
 only


that,
 now
 there's
 also
 this
 added


element
 of
 Trump
 having
 a
 potentially


very
 heavy
 hand
 in
 their
 country.
 So
 how


is
 that
 playing
 with
 people?
 This
 is
 a


country
 that
 has
 gotten
 used
 to


disappointments,
 that
 has
 gotten
 used
 to


tragedy.
 In
 the
 years
 that
 I
 have
 lived


here,
 I
 have
 experienced
 time
 and
 again


a
 moment
 of
 extreme
 exaltation
 when
 it


appeared
 that
 freedom
 and
 democracy
 were


just
 within
 grasp.
 You
 know,
 I
 have


witnessed
 millions
 of
 people
 come
 out
 on


the
 streets
 in
 popular
 protest
 against


the
 government.
 And
 every
 time
 that


hope,
 that
 democracy,
 that
 freedom
 was


snatched
 from
 under
 their
 nose.


This
 is
 a
 country
 that
 has
 been
 burned


many
 times
 and
 where
 people
 have
 learned


to
 temper
 their
 expectations.
 And
 I


think
 most
 people
 in
 Venezuela
 when
 they


watched
 ElC
 being
 sworn
 in
 as
 the


country's
 interim
 president,
 this
 is
 not


the
 outcome
 they
 would
 have
 hoped
 for.


This
 is
 not
 the
 outcome
 they
 would
 have


chosen.
 This
 is
 an
 outcome
 that
 is
 not


just,
 but
 is
 not
 fair,
 but
 is
 an
 outcome


that
 just
 might
 make
 their
 difficult


life
 just
 a
 little
 bit
 easier.


Well,
 Anatoli,
 I
 hope
 you
 get
 some
 rest


in
 the
 coming
 days
 and
 thank
 you
 so


much.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> On
 Monday,
 in
 her
 first
 interview
 since


the
 capture
 of
 Maduro,
 Maria
 Karina


Machado
 told
 Fox's
 Shan
 Hannity
 that
 she


hadn't
 spoken
 with
 President
 Trump
 since


the
 US
 deposed
 the
 Venezuelan
 leader.


But
 I
 do
 want
 to
 say
 today
 on
 behalf
 of


the
 Venezuelan
 people
 how
 grateful
 we


are
 for
 his
 courage.


>> She
 also
 thanked
 Trump
 for
 the
 quote


courageous
 actions
 that
 led
 to
 Maduro's


removal.


>> It's
 a
 milestone
 and
 it's
 not
 only
 huge


for
 the
 Venezuelan
 people
 on
 our
 future.


I
 think
 it's
 a
 huge
 step
 for
 humanity,


for
 freedom
 and
 human
 dignity.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.
 Here's


what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.
 On


Monday,
 Defense
 Secretary
 Pete
 Hgsith


said
 the
 military
 had
 begun


administrative
 actions
 against
 Mark


Kelly,
 the
 Democratic
 senator
 from


Arizona,
 a
 move
 that
 could
 end
 up


reducing
 Kelly's
 rank
 and
 the
 military


pension
 he
 receives
 as
 a
 retired
 Navy


captain.


The
 review
 stems
 from
 a
 video
 that
 Kelly


and
 five
 other
 Democratic
 lawmakers


released
 in
 November
 that
 reminded


service
 members
 they
 were
 obligated
 to


refuse
 illegal
 orders.


Hexath
 called
 the
 video
 sedicious
 and


called
 Kelly
 reckless
 for
 trying
 to


undermine
 discipline
 in
 the
 ranks.


Kelly
 and
 his
 lawyers
 have
 argued
 the


senator
 was
 simply
 articulating
 a


fundamental
 principle
 of
 military
 law.


They've
 also
 pointed
 out
 that
 Hegathth


himself
 has
 made
 similar
 comments
 in
 the


past.
