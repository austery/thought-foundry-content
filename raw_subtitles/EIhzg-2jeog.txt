From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Natalie


Kitlef.
 This
 is
 the
 Daily.


On
 Monday,
 we
 looked
 at
 the
 growing
 push


back
 against
 sprawling
 AI
 data
 centers


in
 communities
 across
 America.


Today,
 my
 colleague
 Kevin
 Roose
 takes
 us


inside
 one
 of
 the
 most
 transformative


technologies
 that
 infrastructure
 is


enabling
 a
 new
 way
 of
 programming
 that


may
 be
 the
 biggest
 development
 in


artificial
 intelligence
 since
 the
 launch


of
 Chat
 GPT.


It's
 Wednesday,
 February
 18th.


Okay.
 So,
 the
 other
 day
 I
 slacked
 you,


Kevin
 Roose,
 my
 colleague,
 my
 friend,


the
 host
 of
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 tech


podcast,
 Hard
 Fork,
 and
 I
 asked
 you,


"What
 is
 vibe
 coding?"
 Because
 this
 is
 a


thing
 I
 had
 been
 hearing
 about,
 and
 I


had
 no
 idea
 what
 it
 was.
 And
 you


answered
 me
 roughly
 in
 the
 tone
 that
 one


might
 use
 with
 their
 very
 elderly


grandmother.
 I
 think
 it's
 like
 fair
 to


fair
 to
 say.


>> Well,
 I
 I
 am
 not
 agist.
 I
 I I
 think


people
 have
 lots
 of
 different
 levels
 of


comfort
 with
 technology.
 I
 think
 my
 tone


of
 voice
 was
 directed
 at
 you


specifically,
 Natalie,
 because
 I
 know


that
 you
 are
 younger
 than
 me
 and
 so
 you


have
 no
 excuse
 to
 be
 this
 confused
 by


technology.


>> Yeah.
 Okay,
 fair
 enough.
 So
 since
 then
 I


did
 my
 own
 research
 as
 any
 young
 person


would
 do
 and
 I've
 come
 to
 the


understanding
 that
 vibe
 coding
 is
 in


fact
 very
 important.
 It
 appears
 to
 be


using
 AI
 in
 a
 way
 that
 is
 truly


revolutionary.
 And
 I
 do
 think
 that
 I


cannot
 possibly
 be
 the
 only
 one
 who
 has


not
 caught
 up
 to
 this.
 And
 so
 I
 want
 to


ask
 you
 to
 just
 start
 by
 laying
 out
 the


basics
 for
 those
 of
 us
 who
 aren't
 there


yet.
 What
 is
 vibe
 coding?


>> So
 vibe
 coding
 is
 a
 term
 that
 was
 coined


about
 a
 year
 ago
 by
 a
 guy
 named
 Andre


Carpathy
 who's
 a
 former
 programmer
 at


OpenAI,
 very
 well
 known
 out
 here
 in


Silicon
 Valley.
 and
 he
 was
 describing


this
 thing
 that
 he
 was
 doing
 using
 these


new
 AI
 coding
 tools,
 which
 is
 that


instead
 of
 learning
 a
 programming


language
 and
 writing
 the
 code
 line
 by


line
 uh
 by
 himself,
 he
 would
 just
 sort


of
 let
 the
 program
 write
 the
 code
 for


him
 and
 build
 software
 that
 way.


>> Let
 the
 vibes
 do
 the
 work.


>> Let
 the
 vibes
 do
 the
 work.
 Exactly.
 And


suddenly,
 for
 the
 first
 time
 about
 a


year
 ago,
 you
 didn't
 have
 to
 know
 how
 to


code
 to
 build
 software.
 you
 could
 just


use
 these
 tools.
 They
 would
 help
 you


along
 the
 way
 and
 you
 could
 just
 kind
 of


oversee
 them
 as
 they
 worked.


>> So
 what
 does
 that
 actually
 look
 like?


You
 experimented
 with
 it.
 What
 did
 that


do
 for
 you?


>> Yeah,
 so
 I
 tried
 vibe
 coding
 about
 a


year
 ago
 when
 this
 term
 first
 emerged


and
 I
 would
 build
 these
 little
 test


tools
 for
 myself.
 I
 built
 an
 app
 called


Lunchbox
 Buddy,
 which
 was
 basically
 a


way
 to
 help
 me
 pack
 my
 son's
 lunch
 by


just
 taking
 a
 photo
 of
 whatever
 was
 in


my
 fridge
 and
 giving
 it
 to
 this
 tool
 and


saying
 like,
 "What
 are
 the
 different


combinations
 of
 things
 I
 could
 put
 in


this
 four
 compartment
 lunch
 box?"


>> Oh
 my
 god,
 that's
 amazing.
 So
 useful.
 I


want
 it.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 built
 some
 other
 stuff,
 too.


But
 honestly,
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 clunky.
 The


tools
 basically
 you
 still
 needed
 to
 know


a
 little
 bit
 about
 programming
 to
 be


able
 to
 do
 this
 and
 they
 were
 pretty


buggy.
 I
 tried
 to
 build
 some
 stuff
 to


help
 me
 sort
 through
 my
 emails
 and
 it


couldn't
 do
 it.
 It
 was
 mostly
 useful
 to


professional
 programmers


>> and
 it
 doesn't
 stay
 that
 way
 I'd
 imagine


because
 here
 we
 are
 talking
 about
 it
 as


something
 that
 is
 revolutionary.
 So
 what


happened?
 So
 the
 big
 innovation
 between


last
 year
 and
 now
 is
 what
 is
 called


agentic
 coding.
 Uh
 agentic
 coding
 is


basically
 just
 a
 fancy
 way
 of
 saying
 an


AI
 system
 that
 can
 do
 much
 more
 of
 the


process
 autonomously.
 So
 you
 still
 do


have
 to
 like
 have
 the
 idea
 for
 what
 you


want
 to
 build,
 but
 then
 with
 these
 new


tools,
 you
 can
 just
 sort
 of
 give
 them
 a


project
 and
 they
 can
 make
 a
 plan.
 They


can
 decide
 what
 programming
 languages


they
 want
 to
 use.
 They
 can
 even
 create


their
 own
 little
 team
 of
 agents
 and
 say,


"Okay,
 this
 agent's
 going
 to
 go
 off
 and


do
 the
 research.
 This
 agent's
 going
 to


build
 the
 website.
 This
 agent's
 going
 to


test
 it."
 And
 so
 you
 sort
 of
 have
 a


little
 team
 of
 robots
 working
 for
 you
 to


do
 whatever
 task
 you've
 given
 it.


>> My
 dream,
 a
 team
 of
 robots.
 Just
 sketch


out
 why
 that's
 a
 big
 deal.
 Kevin.


>> Well,
 because
 these
 models
 are
 getting


much
 better
 very
 quickly
 and
 they
 are


now
 able
 to
 do
 the
 kinds
 of
 tasks
 that


would
 take
 humans
 hours
 or
 sometimes


even
 days
 to
 do.
 And
 so
 they
 are
 working


their
 way
 up
 into
 the
 entrylevel


functions
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 white
 collar


industries.
 The
 models
 themselves
 are


also
 getting
 much
 better.
 They're
 not


hallucinating
 as
 much
 as
 they
 used
 to.


They're
 not
 making
 as
 many
 silly


mistakes
 as
 they
 used
 to.
 They
 are
 doing


better
 at
 things
 like
 reasoning
 and


solving
 complex
 math
 and
 science


problems
 than
 they
 used
 to.
 So
 sort
 of


across
 the
 board
 these
 things
 are


getting
 better
 at
 a
 pace
 that
 is


surprising
 even
 the
 people
 who
 are


building
 them.


>> Okay.
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 about
 the


transformational
 potential
 of
 that
 about


the
 impact
 on
 jobs.
 But
 first
 just
 tell


me
 at
 a
 really
 practical
 level
 where
 do


you
 see
 these
 new
 tools?


what
 or
 who
 is
 driving
 this
 agentic


phase?


>> So
 this
 is
 largely
 being
 driven
 by
 a


handful
 of
 companies
 that
 are
 sort
 of


the
 leaders
 in
 this
 AI
 race.
 So
 one
 of


them
 is
 OpenAI
 the
 maker
 of
 chat
 GPT.


They
 have
 a
 new
 agentic
 coding
 system


called
 codeex.
 I
 have
 been
 using
 claude


code
 which
 is
 made
 by
 anthropic
 another


AI
 company.
 And
 these
 are
 the
 tools
 that


have
 come
 out
 just
 in
 the
 past
 couple
 of


months
 that
 have
 people
 feeling
 like


things
 are
 really
 accelerating.
 Cloud


code
 sort
 of
 blew
 up.
 Millions
 of
 people


have
 been
 using
 it.
 They
 are
 doing


increasingly
 complex
 tasks
 with
 them.


People
 are
 using
 these
 in
 their
 jobs
 in


the
 software
 industry.
 And
 what's
 really


changed
 is
 that
 if
 you
 talk
 to
 people
 at


the
 big
 AI
 companies
 who
 used
 to


program,
 who
 used
 to
 write
 code
 by
 hand,


they'll
 say,
 "I
 I
 don't
 write
 any
 code


anymore.
 I
 basically
 supervise
 this
 team


of
 agents
 and
 I
 kind
 of
 orchestrate
 them


and
 set
 them
 off
 toward
 tasks
 and
 then
 I


go
 get
 lunch
 and
 I
 come
 back
 and
 the


work
 is
 done.


>> Okay,
 I
 want
 to
 understand
 this.
 I
 want


to
 understand
 the
 story
 of
 this.
 I
 think


we
 should
 pick
 one
 and
 it
 sounds
 like


claude
 code
 has
 been
 the
 one
 that's
 been


blowing
 up.
 So
 tell
 me
 the
 story
 of
 this


model.
 How
 did
 it
 start?
 How
 did
 it
 get


created?


So
 this
 app
 Claude
 code
 started
 as
 a


side
 project.
 Basically
 an
 engineer
 at


Anthropic
 named
 Boris
 Churnney
 had
 an


idea.
 He
 was
 trying
 to
 sort
 of
 get
 a


sense
 of
 what
 Claude
 Anthropic's
 chatbot


could
 do.
 So
 he
 said,
 "Well,
 what
 if
 I


just
 give
 it
 my
 computer?
 What
 if
 I


install
 Claude
 inside
 the
 terminal
 app,


which
 is
 the
 app
 that
 you
 use
 to
 write


code
 and
 interface
 with
 your
 computer
 if


you're
 a
 programmer?
 And
 what
 would


happen
 if
 I
 just
 set
 Cloud
 loose
 inside


my
 computer
 with
 a
 bunch
 of
 tools
 like


give
 it
 the
 ability
 to
 write
 scripts,
 to


create
 files,
 to
 organize
 things,
 to


debug
 code,
 and
 he
 starts
 seeing


something
 really
 interesting
 happening


around
 the
 office.
 His
 colleagues
 are


starting
 to
 use
 this
 tool
 to
 do
 their


jobs.
 They're
 starting
 to
 program
 with


it.
 It
 started
 with
 the
 engineers.


They're
 saying,
 "This
 is
 really
 great


for
 coding."
 At
 first
 it's
 maybe
 20%
 of


their
 engineers
 and
 then
 it's
 40%
 and


now
 all
 of
 them
 are
 using
 it.
 But
 it's


also
 being
 used
 by
 people
 who
 are
 not


professional
 programmers.
 People
 in


marketing
 and
 sales
 and
 finance
 are


using
 this
 not
 to
 just
 build
 little
 apps


but
 to
 automate
 parts
 of
 their
 jobs.


>> So
 it's
 like
 really
 catching
 on
 way


beyond
 you
 know
 the
 technical
 people


like
 normies
 are
 using
 it.


>> Exactly.
 What
 people
 have
 discovered
 is


that
 it
 can
 do
 lots
 of
 stuff.
 It
 can


automate
 your
 email.
 It
 can
 create


dashboards
 for
 things.
 It
 can
 reorganize


the
 files
 on
 your
 computer.


It's
 sort
 of
 like
 you
 just
 have
 a


computer
 that
 can
 use
 a
 computer.
 Now,


this
 is
 starting
 to
 blow
 my
 mind,
 but
 I


want
 to
 see
 it
 in
 action.
 Can
 we
 make


something
 together?
 Can
 you
 make


something
 for
 me?
 How
 does
 this
 work?


>> Okay,
 I
 would
 love
 to
 show
 you.
 So,
 what


I'll
 do
 is
 I
 will
 share
 my
 screen
 here.


>> I'm
 excited
 and
 a
 little
 scared.


>> Don't
 be
 scared.
 It'll
 be
 fine.


Okay.
 So,
 this
 is
 the
 terminal
 app.
 Have


you
 spent
 much
 time
 in
 the
 terminal
 app


on
 your
 computer?


>> The
 answer
 is
 not
 going
 to
 surprise
 you.


No.


>> Okay.
 So,
 I
 had
 not
 either
 before
 I


started
 using
 cloud
 code.


>> Okay.
 This
 looks
 technical
 though,


Kevin.
 Can
 I
 just
 say
 this
 is
 not
 my


chat
 GBT
 window.


>> No,
 this
 looks
 like
 hardcore
 programming


things.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 interface
 is


what
 has
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 feel
 like


this
 is
 a
 tool
 that
 they
 can't
 use


because
 they
 don't
 write
 code.
 Right.


>> So
 I
 will
 just
 say
 I
 do
 not
 write
 code.


I
 am
 not
 a
 coder.


>> You're
 closer
 to
 me
 than
 them.
 You're


saying


>> I
 am
 much
 closer
 to
 to
 you
 than
 them.


>> So
 okay,
 here
 we
 are.
 We're
 inside
 Cloud


Code
 and
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 give
 it
 a


prompt.
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 build
 a
 website


for
 my
 colleague
 Natalie
 Kitroof.
 And
 I


noticed,
 Natalie,
 that
 you
 don't
 have
 a


personal
 website,
 at least
 that
 I
 could


see.
 Correct.
 Do
 you
 have
 Do
 you
 have


one?


>> I
 don't.
 I've
 kind
 of
 given
 over
 my


identity
 to
 the
 New
 York
 Times.


>> No,
 see,
 you
 need
 one.
 You
 are
 a


big-time
 podcast
 host
 now.
 And
 so,
 you


need
 a
 website
 for
 yourself.
 So,
 she's


the
 co-host
 of
 the
 Daily.
 And
 the
 site


should
 look,
 how
 do
 you
 want
 it
 to
 look?


Sleek
 and
 professional.


>> Yes.
 And
 cool.
 Make
 me
 look
 cool,


please.
 Thank
 you.


>> And
 cool.


And
 professional.


Make
 her
 look


>> And
 also
 cool.
 Sorry.
 Thank
 you.
 Yeah,


>> she
 really
 likes
 the
 Philadelphia


Eagles,
 so
 maybe
 do
 it
 in
 eagles
 colors.


>> This
 is
 getting
 better
 and
 better.


>> All right,
 so
 I
 I
 hit
 enter
 and
 it
 says


burrowing,
 which
 is
 one
 of
 its
 words


that
 it
 uses
 for
 thinking.


>> Do
 we
 know
 what
 it's
 doing?


>> I
 promise
 you
 I
 do
 not
 understand
 what


it's
 doing.
 Like
 a
 professional
 coder


would
 know
 what
 it
 is
 doing,
 right?
 All


I
 know
 is
 that
 is
 doing
 something
 and


it's
 going
 to
 think
 about
 it.
 It's
 going


to
 make
 a
 plan
 and
 then
 it's
 going
 to


start
 building.


>> How
 long
 does
 it
 take?


>> It
 depends
 on
 the
 complexity
 of
 the


task.
 I've
 had
 tasks
 that
 have
 taken
 10,


20,
 30
 minutes
 before,
 but
 I
 think
 this


is
 going
 to
 be
 just
 a
 minute
 or
 two
 at


most.


>> And
 the
 idea
 is
 that
 it's
 kind
 of


scraping
 the
 internet
 for
 information


about
 me.
 Did
 you
 tell
 it
 to
 make
 sure


that
 everyone
 knows
 I'm
 young?
 Also,
 I'm


just


>> We
 can
 add
 that
 in
 a
 subsequent
 version.


So,
 it
 wrote
 644
 lines
 of
 code.


Okay,
 so
 it's
 live.
 Let's
 just
 see
 what


it
 looks
 like
 together.


>> What
 was
 that?
 A
 minute.


>> That
 took
 uh
 a
 minute
 and
 36
 seconds.


Look
 at
 that.


>> Wow.


>> We've
 got
 a
 little
 like
 Eagles
 Green


website.


>> Yeah,
 I
 see
 that.
 Oh
 my
 god.
 It
 knows


that
 I
 was
 in
 Mexico
 as
 a
 foreign


correspondent.


>> Uh-huh.


>> Oh,
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 daily.
 The
 best


journalism
 doesn't
 just
 inform,
 it
 makes


you
 feel
 the
 weight
 of
 reality
 and
 then


pushes
 you
 to
 care.
 It's
 a
 quote
 that
 is


attributed
 to
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 daily,


>> which
 is
 not
 a
 real
 person.


>> So,
 because
 I
 didn't
 give
 it
 a
 lot
 of


information,
 it
 uh
 it
 just
 sort
 of
 made


some
 stuff
 up
 to
 fill
 the
 space.
 But
 the


cool
 thing
 about
 this
 is
 now
 if
 you
 want


to
 change
 it,
 you
 can
 just
 go
 into
 this


window
 and
 you
 can
 say,
 "Hey,
 that's
 a


fake
 quote.
 Can
 you
 make
 sure
 all
 the


info
 on
 the
 site
 is
 accurate?"


>> Yeah.


>> I'm
 thinking
 we
 should
 maybe
 add
 like
 an


Easter
 egg
 to
 this.
 Um
 something
 fun
 for


for
 people
 who
 go
 to
 your
 website
 and


really
 want
 the
 full
 Natalie
 Kitf


experience.
 Okay.
 What's
 it
 going
 to
 be?


>> So,
 you're
 a
 big
 football
 fan.
 There
 was


a
 video
 game
 called
 Techmo.
 Very
 early


football
 video
 game.
 And
 so,
 I
 would


like
 to
 see
 if
 we
 could
 put
 a
 version
 of


Techmobile
 that's
 playable,
 like
 a


little
 playable
 video
 game
 on
 your


website.


>> Yes.
 Wow.
 Can
 I
 also
 hire
 you?
 I
 feel


like
 you're
 good
 at
 this.
 You're
 good
 at


talking
 to
 Claude.


>> So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 back
 to
 my
 terminal


app
 here
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 say,
 "That's


great.
 Could
 you
 add
 a
 playable


Techmo
 bowl
 style
 video
 game
 to
 the


site.


Oh,
 it
 says
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 fun.
 So,


it's
 writing
 hundreds
 of
 lines
 of
 code.


>> I
 mean,
 this
 is
 insane.


>> It's
 wild.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 why
 people


are
 freaking
 out
 about
 AI
 right
 now


because
 this
 was
 not
 possible
 even
 a


couple
 of
 months
 ago
 and
 now
 it
 is.


Okay,
 so
 now
 our
 our
 video
 game
 is
 done.


Should
 we
 go
 see
 it?
 Yes,
 please.


>> Okay,
 so
 here's
 Natalie's
 techmobile.


>> Oh
 my
 god.


>> And
 do
 you
 see
 it?


>> Oh
 my
 god.
 Yeah,
 I
 do.


>> So,
 it
 says
 press
 space
 to
 hike


>> and
 arrow
 keys
 to
 move.
 Okay,
 so
 Oh.
 Oh,


we
 got
 to
 run.
 We
 got
 to
 run.


>> Oh,


>> touchdown
 Eagles.


>> Go
 birds.
 This
 is
 incredible.
 Wow.
 This


is
 like
 I
 feel
 like
 I'm
 going
 to
 draw
 a


lot
 of
 people
 to
 my
 new
 website
 with


this
 feature.


>> Yeah,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 getting
 so
 much


traffic.


>> Okay.


So
 that
 is
 Cloud
 Code
 and
 that
 is
 how


these
 new
 coding
 tools
 work.
 How
 do
 you


feel?


>> I
 feel
 pretty
 blown
 away.
 I
 honestly


can't
 believe
 that
 we
 just
 made
 my
 first


website
 and
 that
 it
 has
 a
 video
 game
 on


it.
 I
 have
 so
 many
 questions
 that
 I
 want


to
 ask
 you
 about
 it
 and
 we'll
 do
 that


after
 the
 break.
 We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Kevin,
 I
 have
 to
 just
 acknowledge
 that


it
 is
 honestly
 an
 amazing
 feeling
 to
 see


this
 AI
 agent
 at
 work.
 It's
 probably
 the


first
 time
 that
 I
 have
 felt
 awe
 at
 this


technology
 since
 Chat
 GPT
 came
 out.
 It's


been
 a
 really
 long
 time
 and
 there
 is


something
 a
 little
 bit
 unnerving
 about


it.
 And
 so
 I
 just
 wonder
 for
 you,
 what


do
 you
 make
 of
 this
 moment?
 What
 do
 you


make
 of
 this
 change
 that
 we're
 seeing
 in


these
 tools?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 big
 deal
 in
 the


world
 of
 AI.
 This
 is
 something
 that


people
 inside
 the
 AI
 industry
 have
 been


saying
 is
 coming
 for
 a
 long
 time,
 but


until
 recently,
 people
 couldn't
 really


see
 it
 for
 themselves
 or
 try
 it
 for


themselves.
 And
 you
 know,
 chat
 GPT
 has


been
 around
 for
 three
 years
 now.
 And
 for


most
 people,
 the
 novelty
 is
 sort
 of


wearing
 off.
 You
 know,
 it's
 a
 fancy


Google.
 You
 can
 get
 a
 meal
 plan.
 You
 can


sort
 of
 give
 it
 some
 questions.
 It
 can


help
 you
 write
 your
 emails
 or
 memos
 or


things
 like
 that,
 but
 it
 doesn't
 sort
 of


shock
 you
 anymore.
 This
 feels
 different


to
 me
 and
 I
 think
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 other


people
 when
 you
 can
 actually
 build


something
 useful
 without
 knowing
 how
 to


write
 code.
 And
 I
 think
 this
 is
 what


people
 think
 is
 the
 thing
 that's
 going


to
 take
 AI
 from
 just
 kind
 of
 being
 a


fancier
 Google
 to
 something
 that


genuinely
 changes
 how
 people
 work.
 When


you
 say
 that
 this
 is
 something
 that
 the


tech
 companies
 have
 been
 saying
 is


coming
 for
 a
 long
 time,
 what
 is
 the
 it


that
 is
 coming?
 What
 makes
 it
 special?


Is
 it
 just
 the
 complexity
 of
 the
 stuff


it
 can
 do
 or
 is
 it
 the
 utility
 of
 it?


>> I
 think
 it's
 the
 utility,
 but
 it's
 also


the
 economic
 value.
 This
 kind
 of
 agentic


system
 can
 actually
 do
 work.
 It
 can
 do


tasks.
 It
 can
 perform
 things
 that
 humans


would
 have
 had
 to
 do
 by
 hand.
 So
 it
 is


sort
 of
 a
 step
 in
 the
 direction
 of


making
 these
 things
 actually
 kind
 of


members
 of
 the
 workforce
 in
 some
 sense


where
 you
 could
 have
 a
 company
 with
 some


human
 employees
 and
 then
 a
 whole
 bunch


of
 AI
 agents
 doing
 tasks.


>> Okay,
 let's
 talk
 about
 that
 because


obviously
 when
 we're
 talking
 about


economic
 value,
 what
 that
 presumably


means
 for
 the
 people
 that
 run
 these


companies
 is
 lowering
 labor
 costs
 by


potentially
 eliminating
 jobs.


>> Yeah.
 So
 that's
 the
 big
 question
 is
 will


this
 just
 help
 people
 at
 work?
 Will
 this


kind
 of
 agentic
 coding
 tool
 make
 people


faster
 and
 more
 efficient
 and
 more


productive
 and
 give
 them
 a
 new
 powerful


tool
 in
 their
 toolkit
 or
 will
 it
 start


to
 replace
 people?
 We
 are
 starting
 to


see
 in
 the
 data
 some
 signs
 that
 this


kind
 of
 tool
 is
 maybe
 displacing
 young


software
 developers.
 So
 there
 was
 a


study
 from
 Stanford
 recently
 that
 looked


at
 payroll
 records
 and
 found
 that


employment
 for
 young
 software
 engineers


just
 people
 who
 are
 early
 in
 their


careers
 has
 dropped
 about
 20%
 from
 its


peak
 in
 2022.


>> So
 companies
 that
 used
 to
 hire
 five
 or


10
 people
 to
 write
 code
 for
 them
 may


only
 need
 one
 or
 two
 now
 with
 a
 bunch
 of


AI
 tools.


>> Can
 I
 ask
 we
 were
 pointing
 to
 issues


with
 my
 beautiful
 website.
 How
 good
 is


this
 stuff?
 I
 mean,
 can
 it
 debug
 itself?


Because
 I
 guess
 I'm
 seeing
 that
 there
 is


also
 a
 lot
 of
 doubt
 and
 skepticism
 that


you
 can
 really
 do
 this
 only
 with
 an
 AI


tool
 at
 this
 point.


>> Well,
 coding
 is
 an
 interesting
 test


ground
 for
 this
 because
 in
 some
 sense
 it


is
 very
 verifiable.
 The
 code
 either
 runs


or
 it
 doesn't.
 And
 so,
 in
 some
 sense,


it's
 very
 easy
 to
 tell.
 I
 mean,
 the


website
 we
 built,
 it
 works.
 You
 can
 go


visit
 it
 on
 the
 web.
 it
 has
 a
 playable


video
 game
 inside
 of
 it,
 right?
 So,
 yes,


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 software
 engineers


who
 are
 still
 saying
 these
 coding


agents,
 they're
 not
 perfect.
 You
 still


kind
 of
 need
 to
 hold
 their
 hands
 and


oversee
 them
 if
 you
 want
 to
 get
 really


useful
 code
 that
 you
 could
 like
 deploy


inside
 of
 a
 big
 business,
 but
 that
 is


maybe
 temporary
 because
 they're


improving
 at
 a
 very
 rapid
 rate.
 And


we're
 seeing
 that
 some
 of
 the
 things


that
 these
 tools
 couldn't
 do
 even
 a
 few


months
 ago,
 it's
 now
 doing
 in
 ways
 that


are
 correct
 and
 and
 useful.
 Well,
 can


you
 just
 tell
 me
 quickly
 like
 what's


making
 this
 improve
 so
 quickly?


>> So,
 part
 of
 it
 is
 just
 that
 the
 models


themselves,
 the
 things
 that
 are
 sort
 of


underneath
 tools
 like
 cloud
 code
 are


just
 getting
 better
 very
 rapidly.
 And


part
 of
 that
 is
 because
 they're
 being


trained
 on
 more
 coding
 data.
 So,
 they're


sort
 of
 improving
 over
 time.
 The
 other


really
 interesting
 and
 really
 important


thing
 that
 is
 starting
 to
 happen
 is
 that


these
 AI
 tools
 are
 building
 versions
 of


themselves.
 They
 are
 starting
 to
 improve


themselves.


>> What
 what
 does
 that
 mean?


>> So,
 OpenAI's
 latest
 coding
 model
 which


is
 called
 GPT
 5.3
 codeex
 was
 used
 to


help
 build
 itself.
 Early
 versions
 of
 the


model
 were
 used
 to
 make
 changes
 to
 the


training
 runs
 for
 later
 versions.
 So


this
 is
 happening
 across
 all
 of
 the


leading
 AI
 companies
 right
 now
 which
 is


that
 you
 have
 these
 systems
 which
 can


build
 websites
 which
 can
 automate


certain
 financial
 or
 legal
 tasks.
 They


can
 also
 help
 train
 AI
 models
 and
 so


we're
 starting
 to
 see


>> so
 AI
 models
 making
 AI
 models
 just
 to
 be


clear
 about
 what
 we're
 saying
 here.


>> Yes.


>> Is
 that
 scary
 to
 you?
 Because
 it
 gives


me
 the
 vibe
 of
 a
 sci-fi
 reality.


>> Yeah.
 This
 is
 a
 sort
 of
 scenario
 that


we've
 heard
 about
 in
 science
 fiction
 for


years
 where
 you
 have
 AIs
 that
 are


becoming
 increasingly
 capable.
 They're


building
 better
 and
 better
 AIs
 within


the
 AI
 community.
 There's
 this
 idea,


this
 phrase
 of
 the
 intelligence


explosion,
 which
 is
 when
 you
 have
 these


systems
 that
 are
 doing
 what's
 known
 as


recursive
 self-improvement,
 building


better
 and
 better
 versions
 of


themselves.
 And
 so
 that
 is
 one


possibility
 that
 these
 systems
 just


start
 to
 accelerate
 their
 improvements


to
 the
 point
 where
 they
 are
 sort
 of


doing
 all
 of
 this
 autonomously
 without


human
 involvement.
 Now
 there
 are
 some


people
 who
 think
 this
 is
 still
 a


far-fetched
 scenario
 but
 just
 look
 at


the
 trajectory.
 I
 mean
 a
 year
 ago
 you


had
 these
 very
 clunky
 AI
 vibe
 coding


tools.
 Now
 they're
 running
 autonomously


for
 sometimes
 hours
 at
 a
 time.
 they
 can


build
 and
 maintain
 real
 software
 and


they're
 starting
 to
 help
 build
 the
 next


versions
 of
 themselves.
 So
 I
 think
 we


are
 right
 to
 be
 paying
 attention
 to
 this


and
 I
 think
 it's
 irresponsible
 to


sugarcoat
 what's
 happening.
 I
 have
 to


say
 for
 the
 companies
 and
 for
 the
 people


that
 have
 been
 involved
 in
 AI,
 this
 also


has
 to
 really
 be
 a
 kind
 of
 proof
 of


concept
 moment
 for
 them
 because
 there


has
 been
 so
 much
 skepticism
 about
 AI


over
 the
 last
 year.
 A
 lot
 of
 fear
 about


frothiness
 in
 the
 market,
 about
 whether


we're
 in
 a
 bubble,
 about
 whether
 AI
 is


really
 going
 to
 live
 up
 to
 its


potential.
 And
 what
 you've
 described
 is


a
 transformative
 tool
 that
 can
 be


incredibly
 useful.
 and
 with
 that
 the


potential
 for
 real
 job
 loss.
 So
 anyway


you
 slice
 it,
 this
 is
 AI
 doing
 what
 they


said
 it
 probably
 would.


>> Yeah,
 it
 is.
 And
 I
 think
 you
 know
 I


don't
 blame
 people
 for
 questioning
 last


year
 whether
 we
 were
 in
 an
 AI
 bubble.
 I


think
 most
 people
 up
 to
 that
 point
 had


only
 used
 things
 like
 chat
 GPT
 which
 are


you
 know
 very
 capable
 on
 their
 own
 but
 I


can
 understand
 why
 people
 would
 look
 at


that
 and
 then
 look
 at
 the
 billions
 of


dollars
 being
 spent
 on
 data
 centers
 and


infrastructure
 and
 think
 like
 okay
 isn't


this
 a
 little
 bit
 much
 but
 the
 bet
 that


these
 AI
 companies
 were
 making
 is
 that


you
 could
 actually
 turn
 this
 stuff
 into


useful
 tools
 that
 would
 be
 able
 to
 do


real
 valuable
 work
 in
 the
 economy
 and
 I


think
 we
 are
 starting
 to
 see
 that
 bet


pay
 off.


>> Kevin,
 I
 think
 it's
 worth
 pausing
 here


for
 a
 moment.
 Like,
 it's
 very
 easy
 to


talk
 about
 job
 loss
 from
 all
 this
 in
 the


abstract,
 but
 at
 a
 practical
 level,
 if
 a


whole
 class
 of
 workers
 just
 lose
 their


jobs,
 if
 those
 jobs
 cease
 to
 exist,
 we'd


be
 talking
 about
 a
 pretty
 massive
 impact


on
 the
 economy
 at
 large.
 And
 I
 mean
 this


could
 hypothetically
 just
 be
 the
 very


beginning.
 If
 agents
 like
 these
 can
 do


other
 forms
 of
 work,
 you
 could
 see
 many


more
 jobs
 wiped
 out.
 So
 I
 just
 want
 to


ask,
 how
 likely
 is
 it
 really
 that
 these


tools
 create
 that
 kind
 of
 job
 loss?
 And


what
 are
 the
 AI
 companies
 saying
 about


it?


>> So
 I'll
 answer
 the
 first
 part,
 which
 is


that
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 likely
 it
 is.
 I


have
 intuitions
 and
 guesses,
 but
 no
 one


really
 knows
 how
 this
 is
 going
 to
 go.
 It


could
 be
 that
 there's
 a
 short-term
 spike


in
 the
 demand
 for
 software
 engineers


because
 everyone's
 building
 new
 kinds
 of


software
 and
 they
 need
 people
 to
 manage


it
 all


>> and
 it
 could
 be
 that
 these
 tools
 just


never
 wipe
 out
 millions
 of
 jobs
 on
 mass


but
 the
 AI
 companies
 and
 the
 people
 who


run
 the
 companies
 are
 increasingly


worried
 about
 this.
 So
 Dario
 Ammed,


who's
 the
 CEO
 of
 Anthropic,
 which
 makes


Claude,
 has
 warned
 that
 he
 believes
 that


AI
 could
 potentially
 eliminate
 half
 of


all
 entry-level
 white
 collar
 jobs
 within


the
 next
 5
 years.


>> Wow.


>> So
 that
 could
 be
 wildly
 off,
 but
 even
 if


it
 were
 partially
 true,
 even
 if
 it
 were


10%
 or
 20%.


That
 would
 still
 be
 a
 massive
 change
 to


the
 labor
 market
 and
 to
 the
 lives
 of


millions
 of
 people.
 Yeah,
 there's


something
 deeply
 unsettling
 about
 all
 of


that.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agree.
 And
 I
 myself
 feel
 very


uncertain
 about
 this.
 And
 I
 think
 there


are
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 in
 the
 tech
 industry


who
 are
 very
 excited
 about
 these
 tools


cuz
 it's
 letting
 them,
 you
 know,
 build
 a


bunch
 of
 stuff
 very
 quickly.
 But
 as
 I'm


hearing
 from
 more
 people
 in
 white
 collar


knowledge
 work
 fields,
 they're
 just
 very


anxious
 right
 now.
 People
 are
 really


uncertain.
 They
 don't
 know
 if
 the
 skills


they're
 building
 are
 obsolete.
 College


students
 don't
 know
 what
 they
 should
 be


studying
 so
 they
 can
 get
 a
 job
 after


they
 graduate.
 People
 are
 really
 getting


nervous
 about
 how
 quickly
 this


technology
 is
 improving
 and
 the


possibility
 that
 it
 could
 make
 the


future
 look
 very
 different.


>> Okay.
 And
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 about
 that


future.
 I
 mean,
 are
 we
 on
 a
 runaway


train?
 The
 speed
 with
 which
 this
 is


changing
 feels
 hard
 to
 even
 capture


honestly.
 And
 I
 wonder
 if
 you
 think


about
 the
 progress
 made
 over
 one
 year,


what's
 the
 next
 year?
 What
 can
 we


expect?


>> I
 mean,
 my
 honest
 prediction
 is
 that
 a


year
 from
 now,
 these
 agentic
 tools
 will


be
 dramatically
 better,
 right?
 They'll


handle
 big
 complex
 problems.
 You
 won't


have
 to
 hold
 their
 hand
 as
 much.
 They


will
 become
 full-fledged
 members
 of
 the


workforce
 and
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 will
 still
 do
 things
 the
 old


way
 because
 institutions
 are
 very
 slow


to
 change
 as
 we
 know
 but
 there
 will
 be


this
 sort
 of
 new
 kind
 of
 company
 that
 is


emerging
 with
 AI
 work
 at
 the
 center
 of


it
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 a


really
 fast
 growing
 part
 of
 the
 economy.


I
 think
 the
 job
 market
 impacts
 that


we're
 starting
 to
 see
 hints
 of
 today


will
 become
 much
 clearer
 a
 year
 from


now.
 But
 honestly,
 I
 lose
 a
 lot
 of


visibility
 myself.
 I
 mean,
 I
 have


stopped
 trying
 to
 predict
 more
 than


about
 6
 months
 out
 because
 that's
 about


as
 far
 as
 I
 can
 see
 right
 now.
 I
 would


not
 have
 predicted
 a
 year
 ago
 when
 vibe


coding
 first
 came
 into
 my
 consciousness


that
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be
 capable
 of
 doing


all
 of
 this
 today.


So,
 I
 think
 the
 most
 we
 can
 say
 right


now
 is
 these
 tools
 are
 getting
 better
 at


a
 at
 a
 very
 fast
 and
 accelerating
 rate


and
 that
 they
 keep
 doing
 things
 that
 are


surprising
 and
 useful
 and
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 unknowns
 about
 what
 that
 will
 mean


for
 the
 future
 of
 human
 work.


>> Kevin,


one
 of
 my
 favorite
 humans,
 thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 coming
 on
 the
 show.
 I
 really


appreciate
 it.


>> You're

 And
 we
 should
 also
 thank


Claude

 built
 you
 that
 beautiful


website.


>> Thank
 you,
 Claude.


>> He's

>> He

a
 point

Shall

unity

or
