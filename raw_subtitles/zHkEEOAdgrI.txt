>> It probably won't surprise
you to hear that I watch and
read a lot of news a lot
because of my job.
I have to think and talk about
the news a lot too.
But sometimes my brain
needs a break.
So I put on a show that isn't
exactly a critic's pick:
Selling Sunset.
Los Angeles. Real estate. Drama.
Have a look at part of the
trailer for season nine, which
just wrapped up.
>> I know there's still
factions and friction.
If we could focus on
real estate, this is our
best year ever.
>> This is.
>> Billionaire Paradise.
>> I know, I know, don't judge,
but I know I am far from alone.
Reality shows are everywhere
and a lot of people are
watching, even people you may
not expect.
Then there are nostalgia
watches.
And not just for older people.
Gen Zers are apparently bingeing
shows like Gilmore Girls.
So what do we get from these
shows, and what's behind
our addiction to escapism
and nostalgia?
Welcome to The Rundown.
There's the Secret Lives of
Mormon Wives, Love Island,
The Real Housewives of
practically every city
you've ever heard of more
than 30 years after the reality
TV genre really got going, it's
stronger than ever.
So what is it about reality TV
that keeps us coming back
for more?
I talked to Cathie James,
co-president of Proper
Television and executive
producer and showrunner of
MasterChef Canada, among other
shows, and Sarah Krichel,
associate editor at The Tyee,
about finding escape in reality
TV when reality itself is hard
to handle.
Kathy, Sarah, welcome to
the program.
How are you guys doing?
>> Great.
Thank you so much for
having us.
>> Thank you.
>> There are two types of
entertainment watching that's
on the rise reality TV.
And then we have nostalgia TV
and films.
I want to start with reality
first.
Kathy, what do you think
people are looking for
when they're watching,
perhaps bingeing, in my case,
reality TV?
>> I think that everybody's
looking for something different.
I think the way that I might
watch it as a producer of, of
unscripted television might be
a little differently different
than the way that that you two
watch it.
So I'd like to turn it back
to you two, because as
the producer, it's really
interesting for me to hear
what you like about it.
>> Okay.
Well, Sarah, you had written
an article about your
Selling Sunset habit, and you
wrote, more than anything, it's
outsize opulence drowns out the
many moments when I'm
uncomfortably confronted with
the real life wealth
disparities all around me.
I'm hoping you could take us
through sort of your Selling
Sunset journey, because it was
sort of a a love, maybe a love
love relationship, but sort of
turns into a love-hate
relationship.
So for people who aren't
familiar with Selling Sunset,
what is the show?
And then walk us through your
journey.
>> Yeah.
So Selling Sunset is kind of
a softly scripted
docusoap series.
It follows real estate agents
who dress up in glamorous
outfits, increasingly glamorous
as the seasons go on.
>> Tuesday is the Met Ball for
them?
>> Yes.
Let's be very clear.
Yes, absolutely.
>> And that's part of the fun,
right.
And yeah, they kind of just
they sell houses once in a
while.
But I think, you know,
you can't go five minutes
without Chrishell and Emma
sitting on the edge of a
multi-million dollar mansion
and talking about what happened
at Girls Giving, which are the
moments that I'm waiting for.
And yeah, my journey with with
Selling Sunset.
It truly was a journey.
I remember texting friends
being like, I have started
the Selling Sunset journey
because its popularity
really exploded during the
pandemic because it first
released in 2019.
And yeah, I was kind of in
one of two states
while watching Selling Sunset.
I was either, you know,
entrenched into the drama and
into the psychoanalysis and
into the funny, awkward moments.
Or, you know, I was going
through it and looking to
absolutely turn my brain off.
I think the moment that the
fantasy sort of shattered a
little bit for me was earlier
this year in January, a new
spinoff came out which was
Selling The City, which takes
place in New York City.
And, I don't know, I kind of
recognized, you know, the the
exposed pipe and the and the
pylons and the concrete jungle
of New York City in my own city
of Toronto.
And I, I started to just feel
like I was coming down to
earth a little bit again.
And and yeah, the fantasy
wasn't, wasn't so much
working anymore.
And I kind of remembered,
you know, all the,
the issues of, of housing
unaffordability and the
homelessness crisis and, you
know, people's inability to pay
rent and buy groceries.
So these people aren't
that far off from us.
They're they're around us.
>> Some people will talk about
unscripted TV reality shows as
a form of escapism, and they
may make some associations that
it is, you know, perhaps a bit
lazy, some guilty pleasure
watching.
But these days there's also this
term of Rot Day.
What is that?
>> Okay, so the Rot Day is
basically when you are
absolutely allowing yourself to
be horizontal, as long as you
need to be binge as many
episodes guilt free as you need
to, you know, have your
favourite hot chocolate or tea
or whatever it is you want, and
just and kind of rest and lean
into a level of rest that is
considered radical these days.
You know, I think this is Gen
Z's way.
This trend is a reflection
of our greater collective
rejection against hustle
culture and productivity
culture, especially in a time
when we're dealing with
symptoms of late stage
capitalism and being exhausted
from meaningless jobs and and
being increasingly isolated in
our individual lifestyles of
working from home and
perfecting our gym routine and
watching our little prestige
television show, and then going
to bed and doing it over and
over again.
And I think it's kind of
a reflection of our lack of
community and our lack of
touch with a purpose and
fulfilment in our generation.
That's not for everybody.
Rot Days are beautiful
and healthy and and necessary.
But yeah, I think it's a
reflection of a greater problem.
>> Sometimes I want your take
on this as someone, as you
mentioned, who makes this
television not Selling Sunset.
But, you know, if we're
mentioning shows The Great
Canadian Bake Show, MasterChef
Canada, we've got Listing Large,
which is a real estate show.
So listening to what Sarah
has to say does that
is that something that is
in your brain thinking about
when you're producing
some of these shows?
>> Well, I definitely, I, I
definitely want to create an
enjoyable experience.
I think that, you know, all
entertainment, whether it's
reading or movies, is a form of
escape.
You know, in the 19th century,
people were scolded for
reading too much.
And now, you know,
it's interesting to
think of a rot day where really,
you're just immersing yourself
in more rot because the cycle
of reality TV and digital
culture and acquisitiveness and
aspiration is all cycled
throughout the culture.
You're not escaping it.
When you immerse yourself
in Selling Sunset, you're
actually embracing it.
I think that, you know,
the interesting thing about
reality television and
reality is a terrible.
>> Probably no way to.
>> To talk about any, any form
of entertainment, even
documentary.
Nothing is real.
Once you edit it and, and, you
know, contract it in to an hour
or two hour package.
But I think that what, what's
interesting about unscripted
television is that it is
actually can be highly
authentic within a very
constructed package.
And when it works, even with
something as contrived as
Selling Sunset, where,
as you mentioned, you know,
women are dressed, you know,
to go to, you know, like
for like a, you know, a black
tie party when they're going to
show a house at like, you know,
three in the afternoon.
I mean, it's absurd.
That show is, is shot
and lit and, and the, and
the participants, even though
they are real people behaving
and acting as themselves in
their own lives, it is all
fully produced in a way that
most unscripted television
isn't.
Because frankly, we
don't have the budget for that.
But what I would say is that,
you know, reality TV works or
unscripted television works
even on Selling Sunset, because
despite all the contrivance it
gets at something that people
are connecting to.
>> I'm hoping you can pull the
curtain for us a little bit in
terms of considering casting
for shows that you work on,
what makes a good character.
>> It really depends on on what
you're going for.
>> As an example.
Yeah.
>> For sure.
Well, for the Great Canadian
Baking Show, you know,
I think that for some
culinary shows, because the
objective of that particular
show is that this is going to
change your life.
We want to see people sort of
battle it out.
We want to see, you know,
some some conflict which might
actually mimic an authentic
environment on the on the line
at a, at a high end kitchen.
We we may we may cast for
a mix of personality
and cooking skill
for something like the Great
Canadian Baking Show.
Obviously, we look for people
who Canadians are going to love.
We look at at how we represent
the country as a whole,
geographically, demographically.
But you really, really need to
be a great baker.
I mean, for that particular
show, that audience wants to
see people who are artists,
and we we spend a great deal
of time, you know, talking
to them, testing them and,
and interviewing them
to get a sense of their skill
level.
For something like
Listing Large, which was a
group of real estate agents
based in, I think, the northern
part of Toronto.
We it was anchored by a
on-again, off-again couple
that ended up coming together
and getting married
and having two kids at
the end of the show.
I mean, thank God for that,
because that real life thing
that was happening really
drove the story of the show.
But, you know,
it was against the
background of of beautiful
Toronto real estate.
But, you know,
the they would not have
have had the chance to have
their lives, you know, on
camera if they weren't also
extraordinarily good looking
and very charismatic.
>> Right.
>> That all plays in.
I want to pick up on sort of
the competition aspect of it.
We see this even in
dating shows.
We can name a bunch of them.
But the there is what is it
about sort of upping the ante
that has created or does it
create a higher viewership when
there is something at stake?
>> That's a good question.
Yeah.
I think, you know, there's
there's two kinds of stakes in
in my view, in my experience,
either consuming these kinds of
stories or even trying to write
them.
Sometimes I think there's
the external stakes, which is,
you know, are they going to in
the case of Selling Sunset,
are they going to sell this
this million dollar mansion?
Is my client who wants to sell
his house for $75 million
going to be mad at me
if I don't sell his house for
an exorbitant amount of money.
And then there's
the internal stakes.
You know, there's the characters
that we come to know and love.
I think Chrishell has become
such a fan favourite on
that show, and she kind of
has a perfect narrative to
contribute in a space where,
you know, we see a lot of
wealth, a lot of opulence.
She kind of has this experience
with homelessness, and it kind
of aligns with a lot of viewers
values around, you know, the
American dream and getting out
of a tough situation, and that
it is possible to aspire to, to,
to be like and look like the
people who are on our screens.
And it is fantasy, but it kind
of does get to you on that
subconscious level.
So yeah, I think I think
upping the stakes like that,
both externally and emotionally,
is what makes us connect to it
so much as Kathy said.
>> I want to turn our attention
to nostalgia.
From TV to vinyl records
and analogue technology,
we are seeing this
being documented.
We talk about Gen Zs
as a millennial.
It's a nice little pulse.
Check to see what you know,
what the kids are up to
and into these days.
And we know that you know
what's trending.
But in tough times,
it seems like everyone
wants to go back to what they
think as a simpler time,
a simpler past.
And I am just curious,
what is your go to nostalgia
or escape binge, perhaps,
and why?
>> I've got to say Gilmore
Girls, okay, I am that person
who went to journalism school
and is still obsessed with that
show.
I mean, I watched Gilmore
Girls, you know, Saturday
mornings or Sunday mornings on.
I think it was the W channel
with my mom.
And when the episode
got a little too inappropriate
for my age and
for my strict parents, my mom
would change the channel
if my dad was in the room.
But you know, that show
is just quintessential
comfort.
It takes place, you know,
throughout the beautiful
seasons in this small town.
And I watch it every single
fall.
And it just reminds me of, you
know, watching this show with
hilarious banter and iconic,
flawed characters every, every
weekend with my mom and my
sister.
And yeah, it just hits
every time.
I don't know what to say
every single fall.
It never misses.
>> All right, Kathy, as someone
who works in TV, I don't know,
maybe I'm assuming that it's
it's something, you know, that
you're watching, but perhaps
it's something else that that
brings back some nostalgia, but
also takes you back to a
simpler times.
>> You know, the way that
nostalgia is playing out for me
lately is in the kinds of shows
that we are developing.
And one of the shows that
I'm I'm developing right now
is a dating show
that takes people
back in time to a university
campus in which they're
immersed in basically a time
capsule.
And, and, and I think
that it really and, you know,
it's interesting because it
involves people like Gen Xers
going back to an '80s college
campus.
But when I talk to
younger people, they love the
idea because the idea of dating
and having community and
meeting people in a, in an
analogue world is really plays
into this nostalgia for a
simpler time.
>> All right.
We are going to leave it there.
We will keep our eyes out
for that show.
>> Fingers crossed.
All right.
Kathy.
>> Sarah, thank you so much.
Really appreciate your insights.
>> Thank you so much.
>> Thank you.
It's a pleasure.
>> Sometimes you just want to
hang out with some old TV
friends.
They'll be there for you
like they've been there before,
but they can also make you
yearn.
Nostalgia isn't only
pleasurable.
So why do we watch
the old favourites for the
comfort, for the longing or
both?
I got insights from
psychologists and cognitive
scientists.
>> George E Newman, an
associate professor of
management and marketing at the
University of Toronto's Rotman
School of Management.
George, great to have you.
How are you doing?
>> Great, great.
Thanks so much for having me.
>> Of course, I want you to
first start off with connecting
the dots for us.
Nostalgia over here,
escapism here.
How are they connected?
>> Yeah.
So in our work, what we find
is that nostalgia provides
this kind of escapism,
especially when times are
feeling uncertain.
So if it feels like the world
is a bit shaky, people are
more likely to cling to
nostalgia.
>> Tell us a little bit about
the context of the study and
what you wanted to look at.
>> Sure.
So in our experiment,
what we did is we brought
people into a laboratory on
campus.
And then we had they
came in and there's a vinyl
record player and it's Simon
Garfunkel record.
And we said,
okay, we want you to listen to
this record and tell us how
much you enjoy it, how good the
experience is.
But we had two different
versions of the study,
and in one study before they
listened to the record, they
read about how well things seem
maybe uncertain right now, but
if you look at a lot of
statistics, it actually it's
not so bad.
And then in the
other condition they read, well,
things seem bad now and they
really are.
They're very uncertain.
And what we found is
that in the situations in which
people had read about how the
current times were uncertain or
unstable, they actually liked
the experience of listening to
the record more.
>> In terms of the things that
we look for vinyl records, old
TV shows, which nowadays you
can just pop on, you know, any
streaming service and be like,
oh, the good old times.
What are we looking for
specifically when we are
looking into the past?
>> Yeah.
So it's really fascinating
because a lot of that
connection seems to be about
like a communal sense of
nostalgia, maybe not something
that was necessarily part of
your own childhood, but things
that we associate with the
broader culture.
And that's really what
becomes attractive to us,
especially in these times
of uncertainty.
>> Well, you mean communal.
What are we talking about?
Give us an example.
>> So communal, you know, it
could be things like
typewriters or vinyl records.
And interestingly, we find that,
you know, older products, let's
say, from the past, like
answering machines, even though
they were part of the past,
they don't have that same kind
of sense of nostalgia.
>> Is it fair to say that for
people who are looking at
something that's nostalgic,
have they necessarily lived
through it themselves, or is
this something that they have
that they kind of sort of
resonate and connect with and
be like, oh, I think that is
something that happened in the
past, or is it a direct
connection to something like a
typewriter or anything else?
>> It's a great question, and
we were really surprised by
this.
But in our work, we actually
found that it's about things
that maybe weren't part of
your own childhood.
So like vinyl records,
the number one selling
vinyl record is Taylor Swift.
>> Okay.
>> You know, so it's suggesting
that it's younger consumers,
younger music listeners who
probably never experienced a
vinyl record, certainly as part
of their own childhood.
But there's something about
that connection and attachment
that makes it really attractive.
>> We hear the word retro a lot
and people are like, oh, that's
so retro.
That's so in things have made
their way back.
How does nostalgia drive
cultural trends?
You mentioned consumerism.
How does that help what
people view, what people
buy at the end of the day?
>> Yeah.
So what we find in these times
of uncertainty and people
are kind of looking back
to the past.
It's it's not just about
products.
It's kind of images,
associations, ways of life that
we think about in the past.
So, you know, ultimately
it's about trying to connect to
a different time period,
maybe one that we think about
as being more stable.
>> I'm going to get personal
with you.
Is there something for you
that you kind of look back at
and go like, okay, in times of,
you know, uncertainty that you
lean into the nostalgia
of totally.
>> Well, you know, when we were
doing this research, part of
the studies that we were doing
is we were having undergraduate
students listen to vinyl
records in the lab, and I used
to have a vinyl record
collection as a kid, and it got
me interested in it again,
and then realised that vinyl
records are very expensive.
Yeah, yeah.
But but you know,
so I've done a little bit of
collecting.
I also really like
old photographs.
There's something about having
the, the tangible photo.
>> So not black and white.
We're talking coloured but
still.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
>> I think there's something
that's really nice about having
that, that physical photo that
for me personally kind of
serves the same function.
>> There is this idea or
perception that the past was
simpler, more authentic.
Is this a factor in sort of
our reach for for the past?
In some ways?
Is it true?
I think is what most people
kind of we have this perception
that those times are were
simpler, but are they
actually true?
>> It's really interesting.
So the research there suggests
that there's a bit of rose
coloured glasses.
When we think about the past
that we tend to filter out
all of the negatives,
all the difficulty, you know,
life expectancies were shorter,
it was harder to get medical
care, all of those kinds of
things that we don't maybe
normally think of.
We think about the past
as this simpler, happy time.
And so we might kind of
gloss over some of
those negative details.
>> Is it fair to say, though,
simpler times were also
probably in some cases younger
didn't have a lot of
responsibility.
So we can look back at those
days and kind of go like,
well, of course they
were simpler.
You know, we didn't have to
pay bills or a mortgage or,
you know, run errands.
>> Yeah.
You know, and there's
kind of like the blurring
between a communal sense of
nostalgia and our own personal
nostalgia.
And I think you're exactly
right that when we're
thinking about the past, we can
kind of mix those two things up
and say, it was a lot simpler
for me.
I just had to run around
and play outside, and it
must have been a nice time.
>> What I find fascinating is
people say they want to witness
authenticity as well, but then
we have this sort of urge to
watch shows like reality TV.
And I am curious, you know, why
do we binge reality TV shows
that seem to sort of defy that
desire of authenticity?
>> I think that's really
fascinating, too.
I mean, there's authenticity
in a different sense, right?
That that it's kind of
a window into people's
private lives.
Maybe the things that they
would be a little bit ashamed
of showing it.
So that's part of the
excitement, I think, of reality
TV is seeing that behind the
scenes look.
So it's a different sense of
authenticity.
It's maybe not authenticity
with respect to our culture,
but authenticity more having to
do with, you know, certain
kinds of people or a certain
kind of lifestyle.
>> So you have a book out
called How Great Ideas Happen,
and that looks at sort of the
past and how it can drive
innovative ideas.
Tell me, how can taking
a look back through
the history books do that?
>> So how great ideas happen is
definitely a big part of it is
looking towards the past and
being able to draw on past
ideas to fuel new ones.
So you know, a hometown
success story, the Instant Pot,
you know, looking back to
crock pots, which had been
around for a very long time,
but, you know, taking it
and reconfiguring it
and making something new or
Hamilton, you know, which just
kind of smashed Broadway
records.
But that was really about
focusing on a piece of history
that maybe had been overlooked,
or at least not talked about
quite as much, and bringing that
to the fore and putting
a very unique individual
spin on it.
>> Is there a great idea that
is waiting to be discovered
that you think is just on the
cusp of us kind of looking in
the past?
>> I mean, throughout the book,
I really try to bring up this
idea that that creativity and
innovation is something that's
available to all of us and that
there are great ideas
underneath our feet.
It's really just about paying
attention, being responsive,
looking to your environment
and in this case, also looking
to the past.
>> What would you recommend?
What is your go to in times of
uncertainty?
And you want to sort of to back
into a time of nostalgia.
What do you do?
>> Well, for me.
>> As a as a child of the 1980s,
it's all about those 1980s
movies like the John Hughes
movies is a real sense of
nostalgia for me personally.
Yeah.
>> All right, George, we're
going to leave it there.
Thank you so much.
>> Thank you.
>> I love my time in the studio,
but I've got to admit, it's
also pretty great to shoot on
location.
Getting to see how interesting
and surprising and diverse
this province is.
Rundown producer Diego Garcia
got this behind the scenes look
at why filming in the field
matters so much to us here.
We just finished up a taping
in studio.
Now we're heading over to
pack the van for a field shoot.
Heading to the EFP room.
Electronic field production.
Fancy word for cameras.
Ricardo's probably in there
right now, so let's go check
that out.
Ricardo.
Hey.
>> Hey, hey.
>> How's it going?
>> Hey.
Pretty good.
How are you doing?
>> Are you all right?
We brought a camera crew
with us.
This is Ricardo,
cinematographer extraordinaire,
DP, director of photography.
Does everything all right.
We're going on a field shoot.
Tell us what we have here.
>> Well, we have the the Canon
C70, and it's, you know, it's a
small compact camera.
And because we have to be
nimble, you put on the lens,
we have the sound and we have
the monitor.
>> You know, we'll start at
6 a.m.
Ricardo packs up the camera.
Extra batteries.
That's always important.
We're in Canada.
Gets cold, cold and batteries
don't like each other so much.
>> I remember one time, yeah,
we got stuck up north and the
hotel, it was freezing.
You couldn't even go to sleep.
>> So these are light panels,
audio packs, tripods,
a teleprompter.
>> I guess we work together.
I think the first time,
maybe about eight years ago.
>> When I joined TVO, I was
doing a lot of field work.
It's taking me to places
I never thought I would go to,
just in Ontario.
People don't realise how big
Ontario is.
>> Did a lot of field going up
to Sault Sainte Marie?
>> Thunder Bay Thunder Bay.
If you've never been a gorgeous
place and some very important
stories that need to be told,
we Ricardo and I did a story
out there about the Bear Clan.
>> Trying to create this
community that's can respond to
each other.
>> Every day is different.
I meet new people, new story.
>> We get to follow people.
They get to show us their their
life, their day to day.
There's lots of things that
pop up that you don't expect.
You can plan as much as
you want.
>> There you go.
Good.
>> And I think that's one of
the things why I love doing
field work.
Yeah.
You know, it's different
every time.
Yeah.
>> Brampton.
Where are you to be able to
go and meet people
where they are?
That to me, I think is one of
the most important things
in telling stories,
particularly in communities
that don't have news sources,
newspapers.
We know local news is dying.
And so I think it's one thing
that is super important.
I love studio, but I gotta say,
my heart is definitely in
the field.
>> It's adventure every day.
>> This is our last show of
2025.
It's been pretty exciting,
I can't lie.
Overwhelming to start
a whole new show, but we are
proud of what we've done so far
and we have some big things
in store for 2026,
including a real studio.
Let us know what else you'd like
to see on The Rundown by going
to tvo.org/rundownfeedback
or leave us a comment on
YouTube.
Until then, we will see you
in January.
Merry Christmas and
happy holidays!
