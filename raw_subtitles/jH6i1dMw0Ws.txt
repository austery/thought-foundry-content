>> I think the biggest security
threat to Canada is China.
>> That was Prime Minister Mark
Carney during the federal
leaders debate in April 2025.
Fast forward nine months.
>> I believe the progress that
we have made in the partnership
sets us up well for the new
world order.
>> Same prime minister, same
country, but very different
tone.
That comment came during an
official visit to China after
the announcement of a new trade
deal.
So what changed?
Well, it's mostly thanks to US
President Donald Trump's trade
wars and threats pushing Canada
to start looking for trade
partners in places it kept at
arm's length.
And China, well, that's about as
arm's length as it gets.
Relations between the two
countries have been strained
since 2018.
That's when Canada arrested the
CFO of Chinese telecom company
Huawei at the request of the
United States.
And then not too long after
that, there were allegations of
foreign interference.
So can China be a reliable
partner now?
Well, according to a new book,
issues between the two countries
didn't start in 2018.
They go back decades to the time
of Pierre Trudeau.
We talked to author Dennis
Molinaro about why he believes
China has been trying to
undermine democracy in Canada
for decades, and whether it
still poses a significant
security threat now.
Carney isn't the only leader
who's recently paid a visit to
Beijing.
French President Emmanuel Macron
and UK Prime Minister Keir
Starmer also met with Chinese
President XI Jinping.
So are we seeing the end of a
China versus the West?
And if a new world order is
taking shape, what does that
mean for Canada?
This is The Rundown.
A few years ago, Ottawa was
rocked by allegations China had
interfered in the 2019 and 2021
federal elections.
But a new book says China's
attempts to influence politics
in this country go back further,
way further.
Dennis Molinaro is a former
national security analyst and
policy adviser for the Canadian
federal government, and the
author of Under Assault
Interference in Espionage in
China's Secret War Against
Canada.
And he joins us in studio.
How are you doing, sir?
>> Very well.
How are you?
>> I'm doing great.
Let's start with a little
history lesson here.
You say in your book that
China's covert actions against
Canada go back over 50 years to
Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.
What's the story there?
>> Oh, there's a story.
Yeah.
So it goes back really to the
time when the PRC, the People's
Republic of China, was looking
to get recognised by the world
and the Communist Party wanted
their government recognised as
the sole government in charge of
China.
And so what I learned from
declassified documents was
essentially one of the principal
actors of that era.
An individual named Paul Lin was
very influential in speaking out
in terms of recognition of China
that it needed to happen, trying
to meet with government members
of government, academics,
policymakers of all kinds
internationally.
And it turns out through the
records that he was actually an
agent of influence, as the RCMP
put it, for China.
And that really started to
change the story of when did
interference and influence
start?
I mean, because it started to
look like it was a lot earlier
than we may have thought.
>> When we talk about
interference, I want to make
sure we distinguish.
How do we distinguish between
foreign interference versus,
say, lobbying.
>> The covert aspect is the main
element, right?
So when when something is covert
and being done behind closed
doors, that's when it changes
from something that is really
open and legitimate type of
lobbying work.
When it shifts into the covert
space, it becomes generally
could be more nefarious.
And so that's really what we're
looking at is nefarious activity
that is at the behest of a
foreign state.
>> Give me an example.
>> Sure.
So, well, you could think about
trying to influence a community
leader to not speak out against
China in some way if we're
talking about China, which we
are today.
So trying to influence community
members not to.
So somebody could be covertly
doing that for the PRC, for
China, within Canada, not
declaring that activity so
secretly working for the state
and harassing dissidents or
harassing people could be
influencing politicians to take
a certain policy line, could be
stealing intellectual property
by getting into partnerships.
>> Dennis, most viewers and
listeners may be familiar with
the allegations around election
interference, but what other
areas has China targeted?
>> So as I mentioned, a little
bit of other areas like research
partnerships.
So it would be trying to partner
with a Chinese institution or
company, maybe that's got a
state linked influence, trying
to partner with academics,
trying to form partnership
agreements for research and for
funding.
And behind the scenes, there are
clauses to turn over
intellectual property.
So that's that's another way of
trying to influence and trying
to gain tactical advantage for
China.
>> When we talk about trade and
interference, what does that
look like?
>> Trade is is another one that
has a long history in terms of
the PRC looking to build trade
linkages, which would give them
access to different
technologies.
Again, intellectual property
over time, but also in this
case, if we're talking about
trade in the present modern day
era, then we're talking about
potentially PRC EVs, right?
So the risks here start to
become one.
Chinese goods and technologies
that are strategic, entering
into the supply chain of North
America, that becomes a problem,
particularly with our
relationship with the United
States.
And the integrated auto sector,
you're also getting companies
that are traditionally heavily
state subsidised.
So that undercuts Canadian
labour and manufacturers.
You're also getting other
avenues that don't get talked
about a lot.
And that's because in China, a
number of companies have been
pulled into what's called
military civil fusion.
This is where companies are
directly contributing or
indirectly contributing to
China's military ambitions.
Okay.
And so the danger there is, if
we get tied into a company that
provides technology to us or
cars or what have you, that
might have a military civil
fusion connection.
So then we would be indirectly
assisting the PLA, the People's
Liberation Army.
Okay.
>> I can see the concerns there.
>> There's concerns.
>> You are throughout this book
sort of waving, you know,
pressing the alarm and letting
people in on sort of what many
people don't know.
But the Canadian Security
Intelligence Service, CSIS has
listed a number of other
countries, India, Russia, Iran
as potential sources of
interference.
So one has to ask the question,
why is there so much focus on
China?
>> Well, because I felt that
this history had not been told.
Typically what we we have in
Canada, what's happened is
successively over the years and
continually is as I make the
point in the book, there have
been there has been a belief
when it comes to China that
Canadian policymakers have
continued, and even business
leaders have continued to view
China as they want to see it,
rather than as it actually is.
And so you can't really have
that diplomatic history or that
diplomatic understanding of the
country when it's when all the
intelligence security aspect is
ignored.
So China becomes the main focus
because of the fact that it is a
rising superpower.
And it's our second largest
trading partner.
And progressively, consistently,
actually, over the years,
Canadian intelligence has
identified it as the number one
threat.
So it made logical sense that we
needed this story told.
>> Now, I do have to ask, when
you were a national security
analyst, were you able to
communicate any of these
concerns?
>> I couldn't say.
>> Signed an NDA.
>> Yeah.
That's that's an oath you carry.
Whatever I did or didn't do, I
could never talk about it.
>> Fair enough.
All right.
Given understanding that given
the seriousness of the issue,
though you've outlined in your
book, how has it been handled by
successive governments?
We're to kind of look at the
history here and with our
current government.
But what have we seen?
>> So what I saw from the book
were researched for the book was
that continually, you never
really saw governments
addressing any of the activities
that were going on domestically.
And that dates all the way back
to the Trudeau senior years.
You would have instances appear
in the newspaper.
You would have warnings appear
from the security services.
So in one instance, actually in
the after the after China gets
an embassy here, you have the
CBC reporting that the FBI was
concerned and wanted to arrest
of diplomats who were bringing
intelligence using the the
embassy in Canada to funnel
intelligence back to China that
they were collecting in the
United States.
>> Okay.
>> And nothing appeared to have
happened with that at all that I
could find.
You had other instances where
technology is sold to China.
There were efforts to try to
sell.
There was an effort actually,
where they did sell.
Companies did sell the engines
for China's first attack
helicopters.
Tried to do it again later.
You had one instance in the
press where Canada was was fine
with selling China spy planes
that would be equipped with
technology from Israel.
When that got exposed in the
press, the deal seemingly fell
apart as far as I could find.
But we have all these warnings
about the PRC's activities
against and transnational
organised organised crime, but
also transnational crime or
repression against dissidents.
Haven't seen anything happen.
>> Is it different now than in
those cases?
>> I think the danger that we're
into now is that because of how
long some of these activities
have continued, we've had
warnings from from the Chinese
Canadian community and different
diaspora communities that
they've been targeted by China,
for instance, just using this as
an example going back to the
'80s and '90s.
Okay.
And so the difference now is
when we know the activity has
been going on that long, it
emboldens people who are doing
the activity.
If there's no cost imposed, then
there's no reason for them to
stop.
>> How?
I don't want us to to sort of
look into to the future, but how
bad can this be?
>> It can be very bad.
I mean, potentially when you're
talking about a a state that is,
you know, challenging the United
States, which is still our
traditional ally in spite of the
problems we've been having, is
is considered, I would say, an
adversary to, to Canada, really
in these activities that it's
doing, it's bullying its
neighbours.
And if it's able to try to
influence Canadians, if it's if
it's able to harass Canadians on
Canadian soil, that undermines
our sovereignty, that undermines
our democracy and our democratic
institutions.
And that, for me, is very
troubling.
If we can't offer protections to
our people that are living here.
>> You wrote a recent column for
the National Post titled
Diversifying Trade with With
China.
It's a losing play.
Why do you think so?
>> Because, again, for a lot of
the reasons that I just
mentioned, you're you're dealing
with a quote unquote partner
that is been historically proven
unreliable.
And we're not talking about one
administration like we've been
having with problems with the
United States.
I'm talking about.
And in that article, in that op
ed, I continually point out,
just briefly, the history of
where China repeatedly
weaponized trade against us.
Canola.
Yes, canola.
Going back to 2008.
Would find reasons to block its
shipment.
Would find reasons to change
docking, storage fees and what
have you and all kinds of
matters related to it.
And would sometimes just
outright not accept it.
And they did this to leverage us
to try to to exert pressure on
us to conform to a policy that
they wanted.
>> Canada agreeing to reducing
tariffs and allowing Chinese EVs
into the country.
I can get the sense from our
from what you said earlier.
Not a good idea.
But when we talk about trade and
sort of when we talk about our
neighbours to the South, we and
you mentioned China being the
second biggest trading partner.
Does that not make sense to be
going in that direction?
>> Not on strategic materials.
And I would put EV in the
category of strategic because of
the technologies that are
involved in an EV, because of
the fact that we won't be able
to control where the data that
EVs collect go, because we don't
have insights on what companies
relationships will be in China
with the PRC military.
For all those reasons, it makes
it unless we can be given
subtype of assurances or
guardrails, that we won't have
to worry about those things.
>> But we should note that a
number of countries do have
Chinese EVs and may not use them
in government.
In military.
>> So.
Right.
I mean, we've had instances
where they've been restricted
from being driven to certain
locations.
Advice given where you don't
connect your cell phone to it.
So you start to ask, why are you
buying a car like that?
If you have those kinds of
problems, but those other
instances as well, don't rely on
having such an integrated North
American auto market either.
Okay.
And we have auto production here
too.
That is going to get undercut by
that, that trade.
But it's not to say we shouldn't
trade with China.
We absolutely should.
And it's totally fine to
diversify trade with China.
It's when we get into the realms
of strategic technology and
goods, and we have to go in
understanding the relationship
some companies might have with
the state and the military, and
also addressing the activity
they've been doing here.
You do all that, then it's
possible.
>> All right.
In a recent post on X, you wrote
about why the US doing business
with China is different than
Canada doing business with
China.
Yeah.
Lay down the argument.
>> For sure.
Different in the sense of the
US.
One is the world's largest
economy.
So when China tries to pressure
them in a particular industry or
tries to hurt them or retaliate,
in a way the United States
economy is large enough that it
can absorb it.
Simply put, it can absorb it,
and it can retaliate harder.
Okay.
That we don't have that option.
You look at the canola EV
incident.
We, in my opinion, completely
buckled and caved on canola in
exchange for dropping the tariff
on EVs.
What was our ability to
retaliate to China that would
have made a difference?
It didn't seem like there was
one.
And along with that, the US has
more safeguards in terms of
export controls, entity lists,
banning of certain Chinese
companies if they have military
partnerships.
They have a foreign agent
registry that they've had since
the '30s that they use to go
after people that are actually
working secretly on behalf of
the PRC state.
We don't have any of those
things.
>> All right.
Whether we like it or not, it
does seem like Canada and China
will have relations, as you
mentioned.
Of course, in your book, you
offer a set of recommendations
on what Canada can do to to kerb
China's interference.
Let us hear some of them.
>> So one, I think a number of
recommendations that the inquiry
made when it comes to election
financing, those should those
are easy implementations.
Those should right away I think
could easily be implemented.
I would say standardising across
the board when it comes to
elections in terms of not just
elections federally, but on the
municipal and provincial level
and in nomination contests, the
rules should be the same.
You should be.
I don't see why you can't have
people that are 18 and a citizen
voting in a nomination contest.
Why we need to have the age
lowered to something like 14 and
not even being.
That doesn't make sense to me.
It's it's an election.
So those I think are easy fixes
that should be made.
But other things like the
foreign agent registry, we need
that to come in and we need that
to have some teeth so that it
doesn't just function as a way
to manage influence.
In other words, have a nefarious
activity that we become okay
with as long as we can kind of
organise and manage it, one that
actually is used to deter it,
and there's some type of cost
imposed for that kind of
activity.
So those are, I think, realistic
fixes, that some of these things
are already in play.
I think they just need to be
followed through.
>> All right Dennis, we're going
to leave it there.
Really appreciate your insights.
Thank you so much for this.
>> Thank you very much for
having me I appreciate it.
>> Prime Minister Mark Carney
has made it clear that Canada's
future involves closer ties with
China.
But is this the best way
forward?
Lynette Ong is a distinguished
professor of Chinese politics at
the University of Toronto, and
the director of the China
Governance Lab at U of T's Munk
School of Global Affairs.
And Lynette joins us in studio.
How are you doing?
>> Good.
How are you?
>> I am doing well.
Now let's talk.
Given the state of US-Canada
relations, some say that Canada
is now freed from the pressure
of bloc shaped politics and can
engage with China in a more
pragmatic way.
What are your thoughts on that?
>> I would agree with that.
If by blockchain politics you
mean United States and its
Western allies, I think United
States have actually broken
trust among a lot of allies,
including Canada and European
countries.
So people.
So countries are out there
trying to pursue their own
interests, often on an issue by
issue basis.
And in our case, China has been
the second largest trading
partner.
I think it makes sense for for
Canada to look to look to China,
kind of to diversify away of our
trade from the United States
towards China.
But I think we shouldn't stop at
China.
China would be the beginning of
our of our diversification
strategy.
We should also look to
Indo-Pacific and Europe.
>> All right.
We'll talk about some of those
potential countries making
deals.
But some see Canada's trade deal
with Beijing as risk management
under pressure and not a pivot
away from the US.
What are your thoughts on that?
>> Like the Prime Minister has
put it, I think it's a way of
buying insurance.
Yes, it's a risk management.
It's not putting all our eggs in
one basket.
So diversifying our eggs in many
different baskets.
But that also means that we are
pivoting away from the United
States.
We are diversifying our reliance
away from the United States
towards a bunch of other
countries.
And one of them, and the largest
among them would be China.
So it's a bit of both.
>> Among Canadians, engagement
with China remains politically
sensitive, following years of
hostility between the two
governments, especially under
Trudeau.
How should Carney navigate that?
>> I think he has to walk a very
fine, fine line.
I think so far he has done
pretty well, I would think.
On the domestic front, we have
seen a shift towards Canadians
attitudes towards the United
States.
Under Trump, Unfavorability
rating of the United States has
actually gone up vis a vis
Beijing.
Beijing China used to be very
unpopular in Canada for very
obvious reasons.
We have got two Canadians being
detained for 1000 days, right.
And I think on the domestic
front, the domestic landscape
has changed a little bit, has
changed quite a bit under under
Trump, Washington, D.C.
is now more unpopular than
Beijing, and that's reflected in
the kind of latest public
opinion poll, not only in Canada
but across a lot of Western
nations conducted by Pew
Research.
So on that front, he has got a
little bit more mandate, but I
think the government needs to go
out there and not only sell to
people that we need to pay more
attention to China, but also be
also be firm on China, not
forgetting, you know, our
commitment towards democracy in
Taiwan and be able to come to
trade between China and our
commitments towards, you know,
all the values that are still
important to us, including
democracy in Taiwan, human
rights issues and so forth.
>> What does firm look like?
>> You know, for instance, I
think our business with Taiwan
should go according as usual,
you know, should should be as
usual.
We shouldn't prematurely pull
MPs out of Taiwan trip.
Okay.
Right.
We should not cancel any Taiwan
trade deal that we have planned.
We have planned for.
I think that would be
prematurely kowtowing.
I think that would be
prematurely being you know, I
think with that, we are we are
signalling to Beijing that we
need them more than they need
us.
I think that's not necessarily
true.
You know, I think China is at a
phase where economically it's
weak.
Real estate use accounts for 30%
of GDP growth.
Its economy, its economic growth
has has not recovered to the
pre-pandemic level.
It probably never will.
And it now needs to to depend on
export led growth to drive its
economy.
And Canada is one of those
places that it looks to.
But more importantly, I think
because Canada shares a border
with the United States, used to
be closest ally of the United
States, and where the
instruction to arrest Meng
Wanzhou came from.
Not to forget that.
So in the in the age of kind of
great power competition between
the United States and China, we
would think that China naturally
wants a better relationship with
Canada.
So in that sense, you know, I
think we should go in there, you
know, with all the confidence
and we, we we do have cards in
our hands,
>> Okay.
>> Is what I'm saying.
>> I want to get a better
understanding of the meetings
that happened with Mark Carney
just last month, but also the
UK's prime minister, Keir
Starmer.
He had went but very different
in terms of what had come out of
it.
Can you can you give us a little
insight into how those two
meetings would have gone?
>> Yeah.
You know, Keir Starmer, the
British prime minister of the
Beijing trip, he was hammered at
home.
Right.
But you know Mark Carney after
that he went to Davos and then
came back celebrated as a hero.
They're two very different
reception I think, you know,
people would say that Britain
gave away a little bit too much
before the trip.
He approved the mega embassy in
in London with a lot of, you
know, concern about potentially
espionage and spies and, you
know, underground tunnels and so
on.
So he gave away a little bit too
much before he went to Beijing.
So he was seen as kind of weak,
giving concessions vis a vis
China.
Whereas us I think we have hold
on to it a little bit more, more
firmly.
And we didn't actually give away
a lot of concessions.
The EV tariff reduction is
actually restricted to a very
small number of quarters.
>> You bring up EV.
So I need to talk about some
critical minerals.
The Trump administration
recently announced a new US
trade bloc.
And that would help because
China owns a pretty substantial
share of the market.
But Canada has not signed yet.
Should Canada?
>> I'm not sure whether US has
the credibility to mobilise any
country to form a trade bloc,
with its recent behaviour tone
towards taking over Greenland,
alienating a bunch of European
allies.
You see what happened in Munich
security conference.
People are not reassured.
Trust has definitely broken
Rubio.
Right after Munich went to
Hungary and spoke to Viktor
Orban.
People don't know where the
United States stands.
So what if we enter into a trade
bloc on critical minerals with
the United States?
They could turn around and do
something against us.
I think without that sort of
predictability and credibility,
it will be difficult to lead.
And any sort of alliance.
>> With that.
Canada is spearheading its own
efforts to create a trading bloc
between the European Union and a
12 nation Indo-Pacific bloc.
This is we're talking, 1.5
billion people amongst all those
nations.
The US is not part of this.
And I'm curious, can it succeed
without the US with everything
that you've mentioned?
>> Yeah.
The proposal was between CBC and
and and and a bunch of European
Union countries.
Right.
>> And of course, Lynette, when
you say CPTPP, we are talking
about the Comprehensive and
Progressive Agreement for
Trans-Pacific partnership.
>> I think the very idea is kind
of complementarity between these
countries, which is more
developing countries in the
Indo-Pacific versus more, more
industrialised nations in
Europe.
So if those two regions
combined, I think would
constitute a large proportion of
the world's GDP, that would be a
good counterbalance against the
United States.
I don't see that as kind of
necessarily as whether we need
the United States to succeed.
But I think if there is enough
complementarity and differences
in comparative advantage among
these countries, there's a lot
of benefits to be gained.
Yeah.
>> Does this present a chance?
You mentioned the speech at
Davos.
Here's an opportunity for the
middle powers.
Is this a chance for them to be
for Canada to be more assertive
on that world stage?
>> I think so I think so I think
Canada is in the right place to
lead because we are we used to
be the closest ally to the
United States and now we are
not.
So we have there's a lot of
serious damage being done to
Canadian diplomacy.
And I think our prime prime
minister, in addition to being a
political leader, he's also an
intellectual, someone who could
conceptualise ideas, who could
articulate kind of big ideas and
deliver it to common people.
With a combination of the two, I
think we are in a good position
to lead and mobilise countries
and to stand to stand firm and
get middle powers, hang together
to advance our interests.
>> Well, now we are going to
leave it there, of course,
something that we will continue
to follow.
Thank you so much for your
insights.
>> Thank you for having me.
>> I'm Jeyan.
