>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 OddLots
 podcast.
 I'm
 Jill
 Weisenthal


>> and
 I'm
 Tracy
 Aloway.


>> Tracy,
 we
 always
 hear
 about
 big
 startup


exits.
 you
 know,
 people
 becoming


billionaires,
 companies
 getting


acquired,
 going
 IPO,
 etc.
 But
 I
 don't


think
 that's
 most
 of
 them
 is
 not
 that.


That's
 just
 the
 ones
 we
 talk
 about.
 You


never
 hear
 about
 the
 scores
 of
 other


ones
 that
 always
 fail.


>> No,
 this
 is
 called
 survival
 bias,
 right?


So,
 you
 only
 ever
 hear
 about
 the
 winners


because
 all
 the
 losers
 are
 basically


gone
 and
 can
 no
 longer
 uh
 communicate.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 then
 the
 other
 thing


is
 that
 most
 startups
 fail
 and
 you
 know


VCs
 talk
 about
 oh
 I
 need
 one
 winner
 for


every
 you
 know
 whatever
 hundred
 maybe
 20


losers
 or
 whatever
 they're
 probably
 few


in
 the
 middle
 they
 get
 two
 or
 three
 x


returns
 but
 that's
 not
 what
 delivers
 the


big
 money
 but
 yeah
 it's
 funny
 because


it's
 the
 losers
 that's
 the
 norm
 that's


the
 expectation
 going
 in
 with
 any
 series


of
 investments
 and
 yeah
 we
 really
 should


talk
 about
 losers
 more
 often.


>> Yeah
 I'm
 into
 it.
 Let's
 talk
 about


losers.
 I'll
 say
 one
 other
 thing
 too


which
 is
 that
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 a
 lot


of
 startup
 investing
 particularly
 in


technology
 you
 know
 you
 don't
 really


think
 of
 them
 as
 having
 assets
 or
 a
 lot


of
 assets
 that
 can
 be
 sold
 right
 so
 when


a
 sort
 of
 cardboard
 box
 manufacturer


goes
 bankrupt
 or
 whatever
 well
 there's


probably
 some
 equipment
 that
 can
 be
 sold


there's
 land
 maybe
 there's
 a
 building


that
 could
 be
 reproposed
 some


intellectual
 property
 maybe
 I
 don't
 know


for
 some
 of
 these
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 tech


companies
 it
 seems
 like
 there's
 nothing


there
 if
 they
 don't
 succeed
 and
 then


there's
 like
 all right
 you
 just
 pull
 the


plug
 and
 everybody
 moves
 on
 but
 I
 don't


really
 know
 if
 that's
 the
 case
 like
 I


don't
 actually
 know
 what
 happens
 at
 that


moment
 of
 death


>> well
 from
 what
 I
 remember
 bankruptcy


tends
 to
 be
 uh
 pretty
 complicated
 in
 in


various
 ways
 and
 I'm
 thinking
 back
 this


is
 the
 ultimate
 extreme
 example
 but
 the


Lehman
 Brothers
 bankruptcy
 that
 took
 14


years


>> and
 I
 remember
 covering
 it
 for
 like


years
 and
 years
 and
 years
 and
 years
 and


they
 had
 all
 these
 counter
 parties,
 this


big
 waterfall
 of
 creditors
 and
 things


like
 that.
 And
 I
 wonder
 how
 it
 works
 for


I
 guess
 smaller
 VC
 companies.


>> Totally.
 And
 it
 seems
 like
 that
 whole


court
 experience
 is
 probably
 something


you
 might
 want
 to
 avoid
 if
 you
 can.
 So


anyway,
 we
 really
 do
 have
 the
 perfect


guest
 to
 talk
 about
 what
 happens
 when
 a


company
 fails,
 what
 happens
 when
 the


startup
 fails.
 We
 are
 talking
 with
 David


Johnson.
 He
 is
 a
 managing
 principal
 at


Resolution
 Financial
 Advisors.
 They're
 a


financial
 advisory
 firm
 based
 out
 of
 Los


Angeles
 that
 focuses
 exclusively
 on
 the


insolveny
 world.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to


learn
 about
 all
 of
 this.
 David,
 thank


you
 so
 much
 for
 coming
 on
 the
 podcast.


>> Thank
 you,
 Joe
 and
 Tracy.
 I'm
 delighted


to
 be
 here.


>> This
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 fun.
 Why


don't
 you
 start
 off?
 What
 do
 you
 do
 or


what
 does
 Resolution
 Financial
 Advisors


do?
 What
 is
 your
 sort
 of
 typical
 client


and
 what
 are
 they
 looking
 for?


>> Resolution
 Financial
 Advisors
 is
 a


financial
 advisory
 firm.
 It's
 true,
 but


we
 don't
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 work
 that
 other


financial
 advisories
 firms
 do.
 I
 started


my
 career
 at
 Alvarez
 and
 Marcel
 a
 long


time
 ago.
 I
 think
 I
 was
 employee
 number


21
 of
 what
 is
 now
 a
 10,000
 person
 firm.


>> Wow.


>> And
 I
 did
 restructuring
 work
 and
 interim


management
 work
 and
 forensic
 accounting


work
 there.
 So,
 I've
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 that


in
 my
 career,
 but
 that's
 not
 what
 we
 do


anymore.
 We
 focus
 like
 a
 laser
 beam
 on


what
 I
 call
 the
 insolveny
 world.
 that
 is


alternatives
 to
 bankruptcy
 and
 other


ways
 to
 wind
 down
 companies


>> create
 value
 by
 recovering
 value
 and


sometimes
 we
 do
 use
 the
 bankruptcy
 code.


I
 am
 a
 bankruptcy
 specialist.
 I'm
 a


chartered
 financial
 analyst
 and
 I
 am
 a


certified
 insolveny
 and
 restructuring


adviser
 and
 so
 bankruptcy
 is
 the
 right


tool
 in
 some
 cases
 but
 for
 most
 of
 the


people
 with
 whom
 I
 do
 work
 it's
 not
 the


right
 solution.
 So,
 why
 don't
 we
 talk


about
 the
 various
 solutions
 that
 are


potentially
 on
 the
 table?
 Because
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 will
 recognize


something
 like
 chapter
 11
 bankruptcy.
 I


know
 as
 the
 daughter
 of
 a
 commercial


airline
 pilot,
 I
 am
 certainly
 familiar


with
 chapter
 11
 bankruptcy
 and
 that


allows
 you
 to,
 you
 know,
 keep
 operating,


keep
 the
 business
 going
 while
 you
 sort


out
 your
 various
 creditors.
 And
 then


there's
 chapter
 7,
 which
 is
 an
 actual


liquidation.


And
 then
 there's,
 I
 assume,
 more


creative
 workouts
 that
 you
 are
 advising


on.
 What
 are
 the
 options?


>> That's
 a
 really
 good
 summary,
 Tracy.


Thank
 you.
 Yes.
 Chapter
 11
 is
 the


restructuring.
 That's
 where
 you
 get
 a
 an


automatic
 stay,
 a
 pause
 from
 your


creditors,
 and
 a
 chance
 to
 catch
 your


breath,
 raise
 new
 money
 under
 favorable


terms,
 conduct
 a
 sale
 of
 the
 assets
 in
 a


very,
 very
 court
 supervised
 process.
 Has


its
 place.
 I've
 been
 through
 many
 of


those.
 They
 are
 terrific
 if
 you
 want
 to


restructure
 a
 company.
 Many
 buyers


buying
 assets
 out
 of
 bankruptcy
 will


prefer
 a
 judge's
 order
 to
 do
 it
 that


way.
 Chapter
 seven,
 as
 you
 said,
 is
 when


you
 throw
 the
 keys
 on
 the
 table
 and
 walk


away.
 And
 bankruptcy
 court
 will
 appoint


a
 independent
 attorney,
 a
 bankruptcy


trustee,
 they're
 called,
 but
 they
 tend


to
 be
 people
 who
 are
 not
 specialists
 at


selling
 esoteric
 assets.
 You
 don't


really
 expect
 any
 value
 recovery
 in
 a


chapter
 7.
 So
 what
 we
 do
 is
 we


specialize
 in
 alternatives
 that
 give
 the


company
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 control
 and


certainly
 don't
 ask
 them
 to
 incur
 so


many
 costs.
 For
 example,
 to
 get
 into
 a


chapter
 11
 bankruptcy,
 you
 almost


certainly
 need
 upwards
 of
 a
 hundred
 or


$200,000
 just
 to
 give
 a
 retainer
 to
 your


bankruptcy
 council.


>> Wow.


>> Sometimes
 that's
 warranted,
 but
 for
 the


companies
 we'll
 be
 talking
 about
 today,


it's
 not
 a
 wise
 use
 of
 money,
 especially


when
 you
 don't
 have
 an
 expected
 outcome


where
 there
 will
 be
 a
 sale
 or
 a


restructuring.
 You
 simply
 want
 to
 shut


down.
 I
 have
 one
 really
 short
 question


then
 a
 real
 question.
 Like
 I've
 never


heard
 of
 like
 a
 chapter
 6
 bankruptcy.


Does
 that
 exist
 or
 what's
 up
 with
 all


those
 other
 chapters?


>> There
 are
 other
 bankruptcies.
 There
 are


some
 especially
 for
 farmers
 for
 example.


There
 are
 some
 that
 deal
 with


international
 companies
 in
 the
 United


States.
 But
 chapter
 11,
 chapter
 7,
 and


then
 chapter
 13
 are
 the
 ones
 you
 hear


about
 most
 of
 the
 time.


>> Got
 it.
 Okay.
 That
 was
 just
 one
 of
 those


questions
 I've
 been
 dying
 to
 get
 off
 my


chest.
 I
 probably
 could
 have
 asked
 Chad


GPT
 that
 and
 got
 a
 decent
 answer,
 but


now
 I
 got
 that
 out
 of
 the
 way.
 You


mentioned
 esoteric
 assets.
 So
 I
 imagine


that
 there
 are
 some
 types
 of
 assets
 that


are
 very
 easy
 for
 anyone
 to
 sell
 like
 a


building
 or
 something.
 It's
 not
 very


complicated
 offices
 whatever
 and
 then


what
 is
 an
 esoteric
 asset
 for
 which
 if


you're
 not
 a
 specialist
 in
 it
 you
 might


really
 not
 know
 how
 to
 get
 top
 value
 for


it.


>> So
 I
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 in
 the
 new


economy.
 I've
 spent
 most
 of
 the
 past
 20


years
 working
 with
 Silicon
 Valley
 firms


who
 have
 tech
 startups
 biioarma
 clean


energy
 things
 that
 are
 very
 intellectual


propertyheavy.


It
 is
 sometimes
 the
 case
 that
 in
 selling


a
 company's
 assets,
 we
 have
 machinery


and
 equipment
 or
 inventory
 or
 something


that
 could
 easily
 be
 auctioned.
 But
 if


you
 have
 a
 patent
 portfolio
 for
 a


specific
 technology
 or
 if
 you've
 got
 a


drug
 in
 development
 or
 you've
 got
 a


special
 software
 that
 does
 something


unique,
 there's
 no
 benchmark
 for
 that.


There's
 no
 open
 outcry
 auction
 system


that
 you
 can
 conduct
 for
 that.
 You've


really
 got
 to
 find
 the
 right
 buyers


narrowly
 tailored
 and
 conduct
 an
 effort


to
 monetize
 those
 assets.


Okay,
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 losers


because
 I
 am
 a
 firm
 believer,
 you
 know,


you
 always
 read
 all
 those
 business
 books


that
 are
 like
 here's
 this
 massive


company
 that
 was
 a
 huge
 success
 story


and
 no
 one
 ever
 writes
 about
 the
 ones


that
 didn't
 make
 it
 as
 you
 mentioned
 at


the
 beginning,
 Joe.
 So,
 one
 thing
 I'm


wondering
 in
 your
 many
 many
 years
 of


doing
 this,
 have
 you
 observed
 like
 a


commonality
 among
 companies
 that
 fail?


Is
 there
 something
 that
 is
 I
 guess


endemic
 to
 all
 the
 failures?


>> I
 wouldn't
 say
 so.
 The
 people
 that
 are


doing
 the
 investing
 in
 those
 companies


have
 a
 lot
 more
 information
 and
 probably


are
 a
 lot
 more
 intelligent
 than
 I
 am.


There
 was
 a
 recent
 book
 out
 a
 year
 or
 so


ago
 called
 the
 venture
 mindset
 and
 it


makes
 the
 point
 that
 Silicon
 Valley


venture
 firms
 don't
 really
 mind
 losing


money.
 They
 don't
 mind
 investing
 in


something
 that
 won't
 succeed.
 They're


much
 more
 concerned
 about
 missing
 the


ones
 that
 do
 succeed.
 right?


>> They
 know
 that
 eight
 out
 of
 10,
 perhaps


more,
 but
 my
 number
 is
 eight
 out
 of
 10


investments
 will
 either
 break
 even
 or


fail
 completely.
 It's
 the
 other
 two
 or


the
 other
 one
 out
 of
 that
 10
 that
 will


carry
 the
 fund
 for
 the
 year.
 So,
 they


cast
 a
 wide
 net.
 They
 do
 their
 best
 to


pick
 intelligently,
 of
 course,
 but
 they


cast
 a
 wide
 net
 and
 most
 of
 them
 need
 to


be
 shut
 down.


>> Well,
 what's
 the
 trigger
 or
 the
 catalyst


from
 going
 to
 losing
 money
 for
 years
 and


years
 and
 years
 to
 an
 actual
 bankruptcy


and
 failure?


>> Good
 question.
 That's
 when
 they
 come
 to


me.
 The
 companies
 come
 to
 me
 when


they're
 perhaps
 pre-revenue.
 They're


almost
 always
 pre-p
 profofitability.


They
 are
 relying
 probably
 on
 the
 next


trunch
 of
 venture
 funding
 to
 come
 in.
 If


their
 plan
 says
 we're
 going to
 burn
 a


certain
 amount
 of
 money
 and
 the
 venture


partners
 are
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 fund


us,


>> eventually
 the
 venture
 fund
 runs
 out
 of


patience,
 the
 fund
 is
 is
 full
 or
 old,
 or


they
 simply
 don't
 believe
 in
 the
 idea


anymore.
 That's
 the
 first
 thing.
 If
 that


money
 doesn't
 come
 in,
 you
 can't
 make


payroll,
 you
 can't
 operate.
 Or
 perhaps


they've
 got
 a
 secured
 lender
 like


Silicon
 Valley
 Bank.
 I
 do
 work
 with


them.
 They
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 venture


investing.
 The
 bank
 may
 run
 out
 of


patience.
 The
 bank
 may
 have
 to
 write


down
 the
 loan.
 The
 bank
 may
 want
 to


recover
 their
 debt.
 Okay?
 And
 they'll


cut
 off
 their
 line
 of
 credit
 perhaps
 or


simply
 fail
 to
 advance
 them
 any
 more


money.
 Or
 perhaps
 the
 venture
 firm
 has


tried
 to
 sell
 the
 company,
 tried
 to
 sell


the
 technology,
 they've
 run
 an


investment
 banking
 process
 and
 no
 buyer


has
 emerged.
 So
 what
 do
 you
 do
 when
 you


come
 to
 the
 end
 of
 the
 road?
 There's
 no


more
 cash
 to
 pay
 payroll.
 You
 can't


continue
 funding
 your
 company.
 What
 do


you
 do?


>> All right.
 So,
 they
 come
 to
 you
 and
 as


you
 said,
 there
 are
 going
 to
 be
 these


esoteric
 assets
 in
 at least
 some
 cases


for
 which
 a
 typical
 courtappointed


liquidator
 does
 not
 have
 the
 specialty


to
 get
 the
 max
 dollar
 for
 them.


Incidentally,
 I
 imagine
 there
 are


situations
 in
 which
 you
 don't
 have
 the


specialty,
 but
 you
 have
 to
 learn
 it
 or


you
 have
 to
 focus
 on
 that.
 So
 let's
 say


I'm
 doing
 something
 novel
 and
 I
 don't


drug
 discovery
 or
 whatever
 it
 is
 you
 can


give
 us
 the
 example
 some
 new
 type
 of


asset
 comes
 to
 you
 your
 job
 is
 to
 get


Maxeller
 you
 haven't
 really
 dealt
 you


don't
 know
 this
 specific
 thing
 yet
 maybe


because
 it's
 novel
 give
 us
 an
 example
 of


some
 esoteric
 asset
 and
 how
 you
 sought


out
 to
 find
 the
 buyer
 who
 was
 able
 to


pay
 max
 dollar
 you
 know
 Paul
 McCartney


once
 said
 that
 he
 was
 fortunate
 because


in
 his
 line
 of
 work
 he
 did
 not
 need
 to


know
 how
 to
 read
 music.


>> Yeah,


>> I
 deal
 in
 broad-based
 technology.
 I'm,


as
 I
 said,
 clean
 techch
 and
 biioarma
 and


software
 and
 AI,
 all
 of
 which
 I
 know


nothing
 about.


>> I
 don't
 need
 to
 be
 a
 specialist
 in
 the


technology.
 I
 need
 to
 know
 how
 to
 find


the
 people
 that
 know
 it.
 So,
 I
 want
 to


put
 those
 assets
 in
 front
 of
 the
 right


people.


>> I
 run
 what
 I
 call
 a
 mini
 investment


banking
 process.
 We
 have
 to
 do
 it


quickly.
 We
 don't
 have
 much
 money.
 The


people
 that
 are
 at
 the
 company
 are
 going


to
 be
 gone
 very,
 very
 soon.
 So,
 I
 don't


do
 it
 for
 six
 months.
 I
 do
 it
 for
 eight


weeks.
 I
 sum
 up
 the
 technology.
 I
 put
 it


into
 a
 little
 package
 and
 I
 put
 it
 in


front
 of
 the
 50
 to
 100
 companies
 in
 that


very
 narrowly
 targeted
 space,
 whatever


that
 space
 happens
 to
 be.


>> Okay?


>> I
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 everybody
 in


that
 respective
 industry
 has
 a
 chance
 to


look
 at
 it
 and
 opine.
 I
 don't
 have
 to


learn
 it.
 I
 have
 to
 know
 enough
 to
 talk


about
 it
 a
 little
 bit,
 but
 I'm
 there
 to


bring
 people
 to
 the
 table.
 I
 want
 to
 put


them
 in
 front
 of
 the
 people
 who
 invented


the
 technology,
 the
 people
 who
 can
 tell


everybody
 why
 it's
 the
 greatest
 thing.


and
 let
 the
 market
 tell
 me
 what
 it
 is.


>> So,
 give
 us
 an
 example
 of
 ad
 technology


or
 give
 us
 a
 story
 about
 where
 you
 had


to
 do
 that.


>> Long
 time
 ago,
 I
 worked
 on
 a
 company


called
 Proteiogenics.
 It
 was
 more
 than


10
 years
 ago,
 so
 I
 feel
 comfortable


releasing
 the
 name.
 They
 were
 doing


research
 in
 neonatal
 disease.
 They
 had


collected
 oh,
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 many


pints
 of
 vaginal
 fluid
 all
 in
 deep


freeze
 in
 the
 basement
 of
 their


laboratory.


Didn't
 have
 the
 ability
 there
 a


secondary
 market
 for
 vaginal
 fluid?


>> Well,
 that
 was
 my
 job
 to
 find
 out.


>> Oh
 my.


>> That's
 exactly
 right.
 Now,
 there
 were


patents
 and
 there
 were
 research
 and


there
 were
 medical
 tests
 and
 there
 were


patient
 records
 all
 analyzing
 for


disease
 for
 whatever
 disease
 they
 were


looking
 for.


>> We
 ultimately
 did
 sell
 that
 technology


to
 a
 large
 I
 think
 Boston-based


pharmaceutical
 company.
 I
 don't
 know


what
 ever
 happened
 to
 it
 from
 there,
 but


I
 had
 to
 manage
 that
 process.
 The


company
 closed
 overnight.
 The
 facility


was
 locked
 with
 the
 vaginal
 fluid
 in
 the


deep
 freezers
 and
 I
 had
 a
 landlord
 who


wasn't
 very
 happy
 about
 that.
 So
 my
 job


was
 to
 two
 things.
 My
 job
 is
 always
 two


things.
 Number
 one,
 monetize
 the
 assets.


Do
 it
 quickly
 before
 the
 ice
 cube
 melts.


I
 had
 to
 find
 a
 buyer.


>> You're
 being
 very
 literal
 here.
 Like


it's
 a
 melting
 ice
 cube
 and
 this
 is


sometimes
 a
 cliche
 in
 the
 world,
 but


you're
 talking
 about
 literal
 melting


refrigeration.
 Keep
 going.
 It
 got
 a


little
 dicey
 because
 the
 landlord
 locked


me
 out.
 Now,
 landlords
 aren't
 supposed


to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that
 in
 California,
 but


I
 wound
 up
 having
 to
 negotiate
 something


and
 keeping
 the
 lights
 on
 until
 such


time
 as
 I
 could
 run
 the
 sale
 process,


get
 people
 interested,
 back
 up
 the


technical
 data,
 and
 move
 those
 freezers


out
 on
 refrigerated
 trucks,
 all
 while


the
 clock
 was
 ticking,
 while
 I
 had
 a


very
 limited
 budget
 to
 pay
 the
 rent
 and


to
 keep
 the
 electricity
 on.
 Now,
 that


was
 a
 good
 outcome
 again
 because
 we
 sold


the
 technology.
 I'm
 thinking,
 if
 I


remember
 correctly,
 maybe
 $2
 million,


which
 is
 a
 great
 outcome
 in
 my
 business.


That
 was
 probably
 enough
 to
 repay
 the


secured
 lender.
 There
 was
 often
 a
 bank


that's
 first
 in
 line
 to
 get
 paid.
 And


then
 there
 are
 unsecured
 creditors
 who


come
 second,
 trade
 creditors,
 landlords,


things
 like
 that.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 try


to
 to
 get
 as
 much.
 Now,
 there
 was


probably
 $50
 million
 invested
 in
 that


company
 from
 various
 funds,
 lenders,


equity
 investors,
 and
 so
 we're
 not
 going


to
 get
 those
 guys
 repaid,
 but
 we
 want
 to


source
 as
 much
 value
 as
 we
 can.
 Somebody


will
 say
 to
 me,
 "How
 much
 is
 a


technology
 worth?"
 And
 my
 answer
 is


always,
 "I
 have
 no
 idea,
 but
 I'm
 gonna


find
 out."
 How
 am
 I
 gonna
 find
 out?
 As
 I


said
 before,
 we're
 going
 to
 talk
 to


everybody
 in
 the
 industry,
 everybody
 who


knows
 this
 technology,
 everybody
 who
 is


in
 a
 position
 to
 say,
 "This
 might
 be


useful
 to
 me,
 and
 we'll
 let
 them
 speak."


Sometimes
 the
 answer
 is
 no
 one.


>> Who
 is
 the
 buyer
 for
 the
 fluid
 and
 the


fridges?
 it.
 I
 don't
 recall
 the
 name
 of


the
 buyer,
 but
 it
 was
 I
 remember
 a
 large


Bostonbased
 biotech
 company
 with
 a


well-known
 name.
 I
 just
 remember
 that
 as


the
 buyer.
 And
 then
 the
 day
 the
 other


thing
 I
 remember
 was
 the
 day
 we
 moved


out,
 we
 had
 the
 technology
 backed
 up
 on


an
 external
 hard
 drive.
 Again,
 they
 had


paid
 $2
 million
 for
 it.
 And
 when
 they


went
 to
 leave,
 they
 couldn't
 find
 it.
 We


found
 it
 in
 the
 trash
 can.


>> Oh
 my
 god.


>> So
 things
 are
 a
 little
 bit
 wild
 west,
 a


little
 bit
 touchandgo,
 but
 that's
 the


kind
 of
 work
 we
 do.


[Music]


I'm
 just
 going
 to
 get
 very
 um
 voyeristic


about
 corporate
 failures,
 I
 guess,
 and


just
 ask
 for
 a
 bunch
 of
 specific


examples,
 but
 have
 you
 ever
 gone
 into
 a


company
 and
 just,
 you
 know,


>> shook
 your
 head
 in
 disgust
 or
 surprise


at
 what's
 been
 going
 on?
 like
 how
 could


this
 company
 actually
 have
 been
 running


this
 way
 for
 I
 don't
 know
 however
 long.


>> It
 is
 often
 surprising
 to
 me
 that
 the


destruction
 of
 value
 is
 so
 great.
 If
 you


told
 me
 $50
 to
 $100
 million
 was
 invested


in
 X
 and
 there's
 nothing
 to
 show
 for
 it


or
 maybe
 the
 technology
 has
 a
 buyer
 for


a
 million
 or
 $2
 million.
 Where
 does
 the


money
 go?
 That's
 a
 very
 good
 question


and
 I've
 been
 doing
 this
 a
 long
 time
 and


I
 I
 don't
 really
 have
 a
 good
 answer
 for


that.
 You
 know,
 something
 I'm
 curious


about
 is
 will
 it
 could
 if
 when
 a
 company


is
 on
 its
 deathbed,
 if
 I
 were
 a
 founder


or
 if
 I
 were
 a
 board
 member
 or
 whatever,


like
 I
 would
 be
 pretty
 checked
 out.
 Like


I'm
 kind
 of
 not
 surprised
 in
 some


instances
 that
 like,
 you
 know
 what,
 some


important
 bit
 of
 technology,
 it's
 on
 a


hard
 drive,
 etc.
 gets
 thrown
 in
 the


trash
 or
 no
 one
 really
 cares
 about


keeping
 the
 refrigeration
 bill
 going.


But,
 you
 know,
 if
 you're
 whatever


involved
 in
 this,
 like
 you
 might
 be


thinking
 about
 your
 next
 thing.
 This
 is


dead.
 This
 is
 a
 waste
 of
 time.
 I
 see
 no


future
 upside.
 Talk
 about
 like
 those


late
 stages
 and
 who
 actually
 is


incentivized
 to
 till
 the
 very
 end
 till


the
 keys
 are
 handed
 over
 till
 the
 sale


is
 made.
 Like
 how
 do
 you
 get
 them


focused
 on
 extracting
 that
 last
 value


when
 most
 people
 I
 would
 imagine
 want
 to


move
 on
 at
 that
 point?


>> That's
 an
 excellent
 segue,
 Joe.
 So
 how


do
 we
 get
 hired?
 Why
 do
 people
 bring
 us


in?
 It's
 exactly
 right.
 If
 I'm
 on
 the


board
 of
 a
 company,
 I'm
 probably


residing
 at
 a
 venture
 capital
 firm
 or
 a


private
 equity
 firm
 or
 maybe
 a
 venture


lender
 and
 once
 I
 see
 that
 there's
 not


going
 to
 be
 any
 recovery
 or
 minor


recovery,


>> why
 would
 you
 want
 to
 spend
 another


second
 on
 it


>> or
 another
 dollar?
 That's
 exactly
 right.


So,
 I'd
 rather
 go
 focus
 on
 my
 things


with
 upside.
 So,
 they
 want
 to
 as
 quickly


as
 possible
 hand
 it
 off
 to
 me.
 So,
 under


the
 rubric
 of
 my
 business,
 we
 very


often,
 not
 always,
 but
 very
 often
 engage


in
 a
 formal
 kind
 of
 insolveny
 process.


known
 as
 an
 assignment
 for
 the
 benefit


of
 creditors,
 okay?
 Or
 ABC
 for
 short.


>> It's
 a
 form
 of
 insolveny
 that's
 well


recognized
 in
 many
 states.
 It's
 not


under
 federal
 bankruptcy
 law.
 It's
 under


state
 law
 in
 California,
 state
 law
 in


Delaware.
 Has
 a
 long
 storied
 history.


It's
 nothing
 new.
 Goes
 back
 to
 English


common
 law.
 Under
 an
 ABC,
 a
 company


says,
 "We
 have
 assets.
 We
 have
 debts.
 We


can't
 continue
 to
 operate
 the
 business.


So,
 we're
 going
 to
 take
 all
 of
 our


assets
 and
 assign
 them
 to
 a
 third
 party


trustee.
 That's
 me.
 And
 I
 have,
 again,
 I


have
 two
 jobs.
 One,
 turn
 those
 assets


into
 cash,
 try
 to
 collect
 as
 much
 money


and
 put
 it
 in
 a
 trust
 account
 for


creditors.
 And
 my
 second
 function
 is
 to


do
 the
 administrative
 wind
 down
 of
 the


company.
 Get
 the
 final
 tax
 returns


prepared.
 Store
 the
 books
 and
 records.


Make
 sure
 the
 W2s
 go
 out
 to
 the


employees
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 Wind


down
 the
 401k
 under
 Orisa
 law
 properly.


All
 the
 administrative
 things
 that
 board


of
 members
 really
 do
 care
 about
 and


should
 care
 about
 but
 don't
 have
 the


expertise
 or
 the
 interest
 to
 do


themselves.


>> Therefore,
 when
 the
 transaction
 happens,


when
 the
 company
 signs
 over
 these
 assets


to
 me,
 the
 board
 generally
 resigns
 that


same
 day.
 H


>> in
 a
 Delaware
 dissolution,
 if
 the


company's
 just
 going
 to
 file
 paperworks


to
 close
 the
 company
 without
 a
 formal


insolveny
 process,
 Delaware
 requires
 at


least
 one
 director
 stay
 on
 the
 hook
 as
 a


director
 for
 three
 years,


>> which
 means
 you've
 got
 to
 keep,
 you


know,
 insurance
 in
 place.
 You've
 got
 to


continue
 to
 bother
 the
 directors
 with


items
 he
 may
 be
 at
 risk.
 In
 this
 case,


they
 don't
 have
 to.
 They
 put
 all
 of
 the


work
 on
 the
 shoulders
 of
 me
 and
 my


partners.
 And
 we
 have
 a
 legal
 fiduciary


duty
 to
 do
 the
 things
 we've
 talked


about,
 monetize
 the
 assets
 and
 wind
 it


down.
 And
 it's
 very
 often
 we
 never
 talk


to
 those
 directors
 again.


>> I'm
 thinking
 how
 to
 frame
 this
 question,


but
 does
 anyone
 ever
 try
 to
 influence


your
 decisions
 as
 a
 trustee
 who
 is,
 you


know,
 supposed
 to
 be
 independent


following
 the
 law?
 Does
 anyone
 ever
 try


to
 kick
 themselves
 up
 the
 waterfall
 or


something
 like
 that?


>> That's
 a
 good
 question.
 I've
 had
 very


few
 experiences
 like
 that.
 We
 handle
 the


insolveny
 process
 very
 strictly.
 We


adhere
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 same
 rules
 that


occur
 in
 chapter
 11
 in
 federal


bankruptcy.
 The
 veneer
 of
 having
 the


formal
 ABC
 insolveny
 process
 is
 itself


powerful.
 We
 tell
 our
 companies
 if
 you


just
 walk
 away
 and
 you
 owe
 the
 bank


money
 and
 you
 owe
 unsecured
 creditors


money,
 people
 are
 going
 to
 be
 angry.


People
 are
 going
 to
 look
 for
 somebody
 to


sue.
 People
 are
 going
 to
 perhaps
 push


for
 an
 involuntary
 bankruptcy.
 You
 guys


don't
 want
 any
 of
 that.
 You
 want
 to
 walk


away.
 Instead,
 make
 resolution
 the


target.
 Give
 somebody
 a
 place
 to
 file
 a


claim.
 Give
 them
 someone
 to
 yell
 at.
 Let


them
 know
 there's
 a
 process.
 And
 give


them
 the
 assurance
 that
 you're
 acting


independently.
 And
 if
 there's
 any
 money


to
 distribute,
 you'll
 get
 your
 fair


share.


>> Are
 you
 paid
 to
 be
 yelled
 at?
 Is
 that


basically
 it?


>> I
 am
 paid
 to
 be
 yelled
 at.


>> Okay.
 Well,
 the
 other
 thing
 I
 wanted
 to


ask
 is
 I
 mentioned
 at
 the
 beginning
 the


Lehman
 Brothers
 bankruptcy,
 which
 you


know
 took
 more
 than
 a
 decade
 to
 resolve


and
 was
 perhaps
 an
 extreme
 example,
 but


you
 do
 often
 hear
 about
 bankruptcy


proceedings
 that
 go
 on
 for
 years
 and


years
 and
 years.
 And
 in
 your
 business,


it
 sounds
 like
 you're
 trying
 to
 be


pretty
 fast
 with
 the
 windown,
 right?


You're
 trying
 to
 get
 as
 much
 money
 as


possible
 and
 maybe
 that
 means
 you
 have


to
 move
 really,
 really
 quickly.
 So,
 I'm


curious
 how
 you
 kind
 of
 balance
 the
 need


for
 speed
 with
 the
 financial
 and
 legal


complexities
 of
 actually
 winding
 down
 a


company.


>> Bankruptcies
 that
 go
 on
 for
 a
 long
 time


do
 so
 because
 there
 are
 material
 assets


that
 have
 to
 get
 sold
 or
 divvied
 up
 and


you
 often
 have
 a
 huge
 constituency
 of


creditors.
 Those
 creditors
 can
 form


their
 own
 committee.
 They
 can
 hire
 their


own
 counsel,
 their
 own
 financial


adviserss.
 There's
 many
 competing


interests.
 You're
 right.
 Leman
 would
 be


an
 extreme
 example.
 That
 was
 my
 old


boss,
 Brian
 Marcel.
 We
 spent
 years
 doing


that
 one.
 In
 these
 cases,
 you
 don't
 have


that
 in
 my
 cases
 because
 you
 have
 a


single
 asset
 or
 you
 have
 assets
 that


have
 unknown
 value
 and
 likely
 several


million
 dollars
 at
 most.
 We're
 not


talking
 about
 a
 billion
 dollars
 in
 most


cases
 that
 go
 through
 my
 process.
 So,


there's
 less
 to
 manage.
 You
 don't
 have


some
 of
 the
 the
 legal
 benefits
 of


bankruptcy,
 but
 nor
 do
 you
 have
 the


restrictions.
 You
 don't
 have
 to
 ask
 a


judge
 for
 permission
 to
 do
 all
 sorts
 of


things.
 You
 don't
 have
 to
 usually
 have
 a


large
 staff
 of
 financial
 adviserss


managing
 the
 cash.
 It
 is
 true
 that


sometimes
 in
 my
 processes
 we
 continue
 to


run
 the
 operations
 of
 the
 company,
 but


on
 a
 skeleton
 crew
 and
 maybe
 for
 a
 few


months
 at
 most.
 So
 they're
 not
 nearly
 as


complicated.
 The
 outcome
 is
 not
 nearly


as
 fraught
 for
 so
 many
 creditors.
 But
 I


will
 give
 you
 one
 example
 of
 when
 we
 had


hoped
 to
 do
 an
 ABC
 but
 wound
 up
 doing
 a


chapter
 11
 instead.
 Hm.
 There's
 a


company
 a
 few
 years
 ago
 that
 was
 in
 the


sports
 business.
 They
 had
 a
 website
 that


accumulated
 or
 curated
 sports
 writing.


We
 had
 one
 sports
 writer
 who
 only
 wrote


about
 the
 Florida
 Marlins
 and
 one
 sports


writer
 that
 only
 wrote
 about
 this
 team


in
 San
 Francisco.
 Sorry,
 I'm
 not
 much
 of


a
 sports
 buff.
 So,
 they
 had
 a
 collection


of
 people
 all
 of
 whom
 were
 contracted


with
 this
 company.
 The
 company
 had
 the


website
 and
 was
 a
 well-known
 brand.


>> We
 had
 hoped
 to
 do
 an
 assignment
 for
 the


benefit
 of
 creditors
 because
 we
 had
 $10


million
 of
 debt.
 We
 had
 a
 buyer
 who


wanted
 to
 pay
 $10
 million
 for
 the


assets.
 Sounded
 like
 a
 great
 match.


Unfortunately,
 there
 are
 special
 rules


in
 bankruptcy
 that
 come
 in
 handy
 here


that
 we
 can't
 take
 advantage
 of
 in
 the


outside
 of
 the
 bankruptcy
 process.


Specifically,
 in
 bankruptcy,
 if
 you
 have


contractors
 like
 that,
 if
 you
 have


executive
 contracts,
 you
 can
 drag
 those


contracts
 along
 and
 put
 them
 in
 a
 sale


to
 a
 buyer.
 And
 those
 contractors
 have


to
 go
 along
 with
 that
 along
 with
 a


bankruptcy
 court.
 In
 an
 ABC,
 I
 don't


have
 that
 power.
 So
 I
 would
 have
 had
 to


negotiate
 with
 a
 hundred
 or
 200
 sports


writers
 to
 get
 them
 to
 go
 along
 with
 the


sale
 to
 the
 buyer
 and
 that
 was
 not


>> tenable.


>> Therefore
 we
 filed
 a
 chapter
 11.
 We


processed
 the
 sale
 with
 the
 buyer


through
 a
 chapter
 11
 363
 sale
 process


and
 the
 sale
 was
 completed.
 Now
 here's


the
 downside.
 We
 had
 a
 $10
 million
 loan.


We
 had
 a
 $10
 million
 buyer.


By
 the
 time
 the
 bankruptcy
 process
 was


paid,
 bankruptcy
 council
 and
 my
 firm
 and


the
 creditors
 committee
 and
 their


counsel
 and
 their
 financial
 adviserss


and
 the
 delays
 and
 the
 special
 insurance


and
 the
 funds
 that
 had
 to
 be
 set
 aside,


the
 buyer
 did
 pay
 $10
 million.
 The


lender
 only
 walked
 away
 with
 seven.


>> The
 lawyers
 always
 win,
 huh?


>> There
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 take
 a


toll
 on
 the
 way
 through
 bankruptcy.
 Yes,


>> that
 sounds
 like
 a
 good
 way
 to
 put
 it.


Tell
 us
 about
 another
 weird
 esoteric


asset
 for
 which
 you
 had
 to
 find
 a
 buyer.


>> I
 have
 a
 cute
 little
 story
 from
 a
 while


back.
 Company
 called
 Co-apt,
 CO
 A
 P
 was


developing
 some
 new
 technology
 for
 for


cosmetic
 surgery.
 We
 did
 operate
 that


company
 for
 a
 few
 weeks.
 We
 did
 run
 a


sale
 process
 and
 we
 did
 find
 a
 buyer.


Now,
 a
 couple
 funny
 things
 about
 this


company.
 First,
 when
 we
 go
 into
 a


company
 like
 this,
 we
 have
 to
 remember


sell
 the
 assets,
 but
 we
 also
 have
 to


wrap
 everything
 up.
 People
 get
 up
 from


their
 desks
 and
 walk
 away.
 They
 leave


things
 almost
 as
 if
 they
 were
 taken
 by


aliens
 in
 some
 cases.
 So,
 we
 do


everything.
 Remember,
 the
 board
 put
 us


in
 charge.
 We've
 got
 to
 monetize
 the


assets,
 but
 we've
 got
 to
 report
 to
 the


landlord.
 We've
 got
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 the


furniture
 perhaps.
 Back
 in
 the
 vaginal


fluid
 company,
 I
 forgot
 to
 mention
 there


was
 E.coli
 in
 their
 laboratory.


>> Lovely.
 Lovely.
 So,
 we
 very
 often


contract
 with
 hazardous
 materials
 firms


to
 make
 sure
 we
 we
 clean
 those
 things


up.
 That's
 part
 of
 the
 deal.
 Remember,


we're
 putting
 a
 bow
 on
 these
 things
 for


the
 directors
 and
 they
 expect
 to
 not


have
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 hear
 about
 any


blowback
 any
 anything
 uh
 later
 on.
 So,


we
 have
 a
 full
 service
 process
 here.
 So,


at
 Co-App
 though,
 remember
 this
 was


cosmetic
 surgery.
 They
 had
 a
 technology


for
 a
 special
 device
 with
 hooks
 that


they
 would
 drill
 into
 your
 skull
 and


then
 they
 would
 pull
 the
 skin
 up
 over


those
 hooks.


>> I've
 seen
 pictures
 of
 that.
 That
 was


that
 was
 the
 technology
 that
 was
 being


developed.


>> I've
 seen
 these
 images.
 It's
 so


disturbing.
 I
 can't
 even
 believe
 that's


real.
 Anyway,
 keep
 going.


>> It's
 real
 and
 and
 we
 did
 sell
 it
 to


somebody.
 Somebody
 found
 value
 in
 that


enough
 to
 get
 the
 bank
 repaid
 almost
 in


in
 that
 case.
 But
 the
 real
 trick
 of
 the


story
 here
 was
 that
 to
 practice
 this,
 to


experiment
 on
 this,
 to
 develop
 this


technology,
 you
 actually
 need
 real
 human


heads
 to
 do
 it
 apparently.


>> Lovely.


>> So,
 as
 we
 were
 moving
 out,
 we
 found
 four


or
 five
 human
 heads
 in
 the
 freezer.
 So,


if
 you're
 a
 director
 of
 a
 company,
 if


you're
 in
 Silicon
 Valley
 and
 you're


deciding
 where
 to
 allocate
 your


investments
 and
 you
 find
 out
 that
 this


one's
 gone
 down,
 do
 you
 want
 to
 be
 the


one
 making
 the
 decision
 or
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 how
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 things
 like


that?
 I
 I
 have
 lots
 of
 stories
 about


things
 that
 just
 nobody
 would
 want
 to


deal
 with.
 Now,
 you
 might
 ask
 yourself,


what
 do
 you
 do
 with
 human
 heads?


>> Yep.


>> You'll
 be
 surprised
 to
 learn
 that
 there


are
 actually
 people
 that
 specialize
 in


this
 industry.
 A
 van
 rolled
 up.


These
 are
 people
 that
 look
 like
 they


might
 have
 worked
 for
 the
 circus.


This
 is
 not
 an
 industry
 where
 you


attract
 everyday
 run-of-the-mill
 people,


I
 suppose.
 So,
 I
 deal
 with
 things
 like


that.
 I
 had
 nuclear
 waste
 in
 one
 of
 my


deals.


>> Wait,
 wait.
 What
 do
 they
 do
 with
 the


heads?


>> I
 wasn't
 going
 to
 ask
 that
 question.


>> Oh,
 okay.


>> I'm
 sorry.
 I
 don't
 have
 more
 to
 the


story,
 but
 we
 uh
 we
 found
 somebody
 to


take
 them
 off.


>> My
 job
 was
 to
 get
 the
 human
 heads
 off


and
 then
 move
 on
 with
 life.


>> Your
 job
 is
 done.


>> I
 divide
 the
 world
 into
 two
 sections.


things
 that
 are
 my
 problem,
 things
 that


are
 not
 my
 problem.
 And
 I
 find
 that
 I'm


much
 happier
 that
 way.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 I
 did
 have
 nuclear
 waste
 one
 time.


There
 was
 a
 a
 nuclear
 medicine
 company,


not
 buckets
 of
 glowing
 rods,
 but
 you


know,
 something
 you
 could
 hold
 in
 your


hand,
 but
 still
 it
 needed
 to
 be
 disposed


of
 properly.
 Once
 again,
 these
 are


things
 that
 people
 who
 signed
 up
 to
 be
 a


director
 don't
 want
 to
 spend
 their
 time


solving.


>> I
 was
 about
 to
 ask,
 what's
 the
 weirdest


thing
 you
 ever
 had
 to
 sell,
 but
 I'm


assuming,
 you
 know,
 human
 heads
 would
 be


up
 there
 along
 with
 nuclear
 waste.
 So


maybe
 I'll
 ask
 instead.
 What's
 the
 most


creative
 buyer
 solution
 that
 you
 have


come
 up
 with?


>> Well,
 let
 me
 tell
 another
 story
 then.


And
 I
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 mention
 the
 name


because
 it
 was
 a
 Fortune
 500
 company


that
 was
 involved,
 but
 I'll
 tell
 you


enough
 to
 be
 interesting.
 I
 got
 a
 call


about
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 ago
 from
 an


attorney
 who
 sends
 me
 business
 here
 in


New
 York.
 Actually,
 they
 said,
 "My


client
 has
 a
 disaster.
 They
 need
 to
 talk


to
 you
 right
 away."
 I
 get
 on
 the
 phone


with
 the
 board
 of
 directors.
 H
 we
 just


found
 out
 the
 CEO
 has
 been
 lying
 to
 us


and
 we're
 out
 of
 cash
 and
 we
 can't
 make


payroll
 and
 we've
 got
 to
 shut
 down
 right


away.
 Okay,
 so
 we
 came
 in
 took
 over
 and


turns
 out
 the
 company
 and
 I
 again
 I


can't
 get
 too
 specific.
 I
 can
 tell
 you


it
 was
 so
 new
 economy
 that
 it
 just


screams
 peak.com


silliest
 concept
 that
 I
 had
 heard
 in
 a


long
 time
 and
 I
 wish
 I
 could
 tell
 you


what
 it
 was.
 company
 was
 teed
 up
 to
 be


sold
 for
 $50
 million


and
 the
 CEO
 was
 running
 out
 of
 cash
 but


trying
 to
 extend
 his
 runway
 to
 get
 to


the
 sale.
 So
 he
 was
 going
 to
 hard
 money


lenders
 almost
 like
 check
 cashing
 shops


and
 borrowing
 $250,000
 at
 a
 time
 again


and
 again
 and
 again
 to
 try
 to
 pay
 for


payroll
 and
 extend
 his
 runway
 till
 he


could
 get
 the
 sale
 done.


>> He
 ran
 out
 of
 time.
 The
 board
 found
 out


that
 he
 was
 doing
 this.
 They
 found
 out


they
 didn't
 have
 any
 cash
 left
 over
 and


they
 shut
 the
 company
 down
 right
 away.


Now,
 the
 buyer
 was
 still
 very
 interested


in
 the
 company,
 but
 the
 company
 didn't


really
 exist
 anymore.
 All
 of
 the


employees
 were
 terminated.
 All
 the


systems
 were
 shut
 down,
 but
 they
 still


had
 the
 the
 technology.
 They
 still
 had


the
 patents.
 They
 still
 had
 the


interface.
 They
 still
 had
 the
 customer


base.
 They
 still
 have the
 business
 plan.


So,
 the
 buyer
 said,
 "We'd
 still
 like
 to


buy
 the
 technology,
 but
 we're
 not
 going


to
 pay
 $50
 million
 anymore."
 So,
 we


negotiated
 a
 little
 bit.
 We
 shopped
 the


company
 around
 a
 little
 bit,
 but
 these


guys
 were
 at
 the
 table
 and
 they
 were


ready
 to
 buy.


They
 bought
 the
 company
 for
 $15


million15.


They
 got
 essentially
 the
 same


technology.
 Now,
 they
 had
 to
 put
 Humpty


Dumpty
 back
 together
 again,
 but
 they
 got


a
 great
 bargain
 buying
 the
 company


through
 this
 ABC
 insolveny
 process.


Didn't
 have
 to
 go
 through
 bankruptcy.


Didn't
 have
 to
 pay
 all
 those
 fees.
 It


was
 done
 in
 a
 matter
 of
 weeks,
 not


months,
 and
 they
 got
 what
 they
 were


looking
 for.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 I
 was


able
 to
 collect
 enough
 money
 to
 repay


the
 venture
 lender
 in
 full,


>> which
 is
 rare.
 Now,
 there
 are
 unsecured


creditors
 that
 weren't
 paid,
 and
 equity,


of
 course,
 is
 completely
 out
 of
 the


money,
 but
 the
 technology
 lives
 on.
 They


hired
 some
 of
 the
 former
 employees.
 The


senior
 lender
 got
 paid.
 That's
 a
 pretty


good
 outcome
 in
 my
 world.


[Music]


I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 have
 experience
 with


this,
 but
 to
 my
 mind,
 it
 strikes
 me
 that


for
 finding
 the
 right
 buyers,
 it
 seems


like
 this
 is
 where
 AI
 could
 be
 really


useful.
 You
 come
 upon
 some
 asset
 that


you've
 never
 experienced
 before,
 like


human
 heads,
 etc.,
 And
 then
 I
 go
 in
 and


say,
 "What
 is
 the
 type
 of
 buyer
 that


would
 maybe
 be
 in
 the
 market
 to
 purchase


human
 heads
 or
 whatever?"
 I'm
 curious
 if


you
 found
 that
 to
 be
 the
 case
 because
 I


imagine,
 you
 know,
 your
 rolodex,
 your


intuition,
 the
 research
 you
 do,
 but
 have


you
 found
 that
 technology
 over
 time
 in


your
 industry
 has
 made
 it
 easier
 to


rapidly
 locate
 the
 ideal
 buyer
 of


certain
 certain
 assets?


>> A
 a
 bit.
 Now,
 I'm
 54.
 My
 partners
 are


younger
 than
 I
 am,
 so
 they're
 more


interested
 and
 savvy
 at
 doing
 that.
 But


when
 I
 find
 a
 company
 who
 has
 an
 asset


for
 sale,
 I
 say
 to
 the
 the
 owners
 of
 the


company
 or
 the
 inventor
 of
 the


intellectual
 property
 or
 the
 president


of
 the
 company,
 tell
 me,
 you
 know,


>> oh
 yeah,


>> the
 top
 five
 companies
 that
 that
 should


buy
 this,
 your
 competitors,
 your


customers,
 your
 suppliers.


>> Give
 me
 the
 top
 four
 or
 five
 people
 that


you
 know
 off
 the
 top
 of
 your
 head,
 and


then
 I'm
 going
 to
 use
 AI
 to
 develop
 a


larger
 list.
 Got
 it?


>> I
 can
 usually
 get
 that
 to
 50
 or
 or
 up
 to


a
 hundred
 of
 people
 really
 targeted.


I've
 got
 thousands
 of
 people
 in
 my


database,
 but
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 send
 this


opportunity
 to
 everybody.
 I
 want
 the


people
 in
 that
 industry
 have
 a
 chance
 to


look
 at
 it.


>> I
 just
 typed
 into
 perplexity
 the


question,
 I
 have
 legally
 acquired
 some


human
 heads
 that
 I
 need
 to
 sell.
 Who


would
 be
 a
 potential
 buyer?
 And
 it's


given
 me
 a
 list
 including
 specific
 names


such
 as
 Bone
 Dealers,
 Skulls
 Unlimited,


and
 the
 Bone
 Room.
 I
 don't
 know if


that's
 a
 hallucination.


>> Might
 be
 hallucinations.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 Skulls
 Unlimited.


>> Well,
 that's
 fantastic.


>> Maybe
 it
 exists.
 That's
 pretty
 funny.
 We


do
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 with
 new
 economy,
 but


but
 old
 economy
 as
 well.
 For
 example,


right
 now
 we're
 liquidating
 two
 retail


furniture
 stores.


>> Wait,
 skulls
 unlimited.
 World
 leader
 in


real
 and
 replica
 skulls.
 Oh,


>> and
 they
 say,
 "Do
 you
 need
 a
 skull


clean?"


>> So,
 this
 is
 a
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 they
 do


human
 ones.
 It
 looks
 like
 it's
 mostly


animals
 and
 stuff.
 Anyway,
 at least
 they


Perplexity
 came
 up
 with
 a
 company
 that


is
 in
 the
 skull
 business.
 Anyway,
 keep


going.


>> There
 are
 niche
 industries.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 old
 economy
 as
 well.
 I'
 I've


done
 a
 lot
 of
 brickandmortar
 work,


especially
 down
 here
 in
 in
 the
 Los


Angeles
 area
 versus
 Silicon
 Valley.
 As
 I


say,
 we're
 doing
 some
 furniture


companies.


>> At
 one
 point,
 I
 was
 serving
 as
 a


receiver
 for
 a
 chain
 of
 pawn
 shops.


>> Now,
 a
 receiverhip
 is
 a
 little
 bit


different
 than
 a
 bankruptcy.
 It's


different
 than
 the
 ABC
 we
 talked
 about.


It
 is
 the
 case
 that
 a
 lender
 or
 even


investors
 don't
 have
 faith
 in
 management


and
 they
 want
 a
 babysitter.
 They
 want


someone
 to
 can
 keep
 take
 control
 of
 the


cash,
 look
 over
 management
 shoulders,


perhaps
 hire
 and
 fire
 management,


ultimately
 perhaps
 sell
 the
 company.
 But


this
 is
 not
 when
 you
 want
 to
 shut
 a


company
 down
 or
 destroy
 something.
 You


just
 want
 some
 adult
 supervision.
 So
 I


served
 as
 a
 receiver
 for
 this
 chain
 of


pawn
 shops,
 which
 was
 really
 check


cashing
 stores,


>> but
 they
 dealt
 in
 gold.
 They
 had
 a
 big


vault
 in
 their
 headquarters
 where
 they


would
 store
 some
 of
 the
 gold.
 If
 you
 go


into
 a
 check
 cashaching
 store
 and
 you


have
 a
 gold
 necklace
 and
 you
 want
 to


borrow
 $50,
 they'll
 keep
 your
 gold


necklace.
 It
 got
 very
 interesting
 though


when
 people
 were
 depositing
 their
 gold


teeth
 into
 the
 vault.


>> And
 you
 know,
 if
 they
 don't
 come
 back


and
 repay
 the
 loan,
 the
 gold
 teeth
 stay


in
 the
 vault.
 So,
 we
 had
 a
 lot
 of


interesting
 things
 to
 deal
 with
 there.


And
 again,
 in
 a
 check
 cashaching
 store,


all
 cash
 business,
 you
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 $100


bills,
 buckets
 and
 buckets
 of
 those


things
 floating
 around.
 So,
 new
 economy,


old


>> Those
 are
 easy
 to
 value.
 At
 least


>> they're
 easy
 to
 value,
 but
 new
 economy,


old
 economy
 that
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


management
 and
 judgment
 calls
 and
 what


do
 I
 do
 about
 this
 situation
 in
 my
 line


of
 work?


>> We
 were
 talking
 earlier
 before
 we


started,
 you
 did
 a
 scooter
 company
 and


I've
 wondered
 about
 those
 scooter
 cuz


you
 know
 some
 of
 the
 they're
 still


going.
 All
 the
 companies
 in
 that


business
 seemed
 terrible.
 The
 ones
 that


have
 gone
 public
 have
 done
 awful.


>> Joe,
 you
 were
 very
 scooters.
 Yes,
 I
 knew


you
 were
 going
 to
 say
 that.
 I
 was
 very


bullish
 on
 the
 scooters.
 I
 still


actually
 like
 them.
 When
 I'm
 in
 a
 city,


it's
 not
 a
 bad
 way
 to
 get
 around
 medium


length
 distances.
 Nonetheless,
 my


understanding
 is
 that
 they
 have
 not
 been


particularly
 at
 least
 in
 the
 US,


particularly
 profitable
 companies.
 What


happens
 when
 they
 have
 like
 a
 bunch
 of


old
 branded
 uh
 scooters
 laying
 around?


>> That's
 an
 interesting
 question.
 It
 isn't


an
 interesting
 business.
 I
 think
 it
 was


probably
 overinvested
 in
 I
 have
 a
 story


with
 both
 a
 good
 outcome
 and
 a
 bad


outcome.


>> Okay.
 So,
 a
 company
 called
 Super


Pedestrian,
 which
 is
 not
 one
 I
 was


familiar
 with,
 but
 it's
 up
 there
 with


Lime
 and
 Bird
 and
 it
 does
 the
 exact
 same


thing,
 has
 a
 very
 large
 presence
 in


Europe.
 The
 company
 ran
 out
 of
 cash.
 The


venture
 lender,
 not
 a
 bank,
 but
 the


venture
 lender
 contacted
 us
 and
 said,


"We
 need
 somebody
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 to


do.
 How
 do
 we
 get
 our
 money
 back?


There's
 got
 to
 be
 value
 here.
 We


invested
 X
 gazillion
 dollars.
 We've
 got


a
 lot
 of
 scooters
 all
 over
 the
 United


States,
 all
 over
 Europe.
 What
 do
 you


do?"
 So
 we
 started
 out
 in
 Europe.
 Turns


out
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 interest
 from


European
 investors.
 And
 so
 we
 had


scooters
 in
 Spain.
 We
 had
 scooters
 in


the
 UK.
 We
 had
 scooters
 in
 France.
 We


had
 scooters
 in
 Germany.
 We
 had
 scooters


in
 Switzerland.
 And
 I
 don't
 do
 a
 lot
 of


work
 in
 Europe.
 I
 don't
 know
 European


insolveny
 law.
 I
 don't
 know
 all
 the
 very


different
 ones.
 I
 sometimes
 do
 work
 over


there,
 but
 I
 rely
 on
 local
 specialists


sometimes.
 But
 I
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 attention


on
 that
 business.
 Fortunately,
 we
 were


able
 to
 get
 council
 in
 the
 UK
 who
 did
 a


fantastic
 job
 of
 corelling
 all
 of
 these


buyers
 and
 selling.
 We
 didn't
 have
 to


take
 apart
 the
 companies
 this
 time.
 We


sold
 the
 German
 entity
 and
 this
 French


entity
 and
 the
 Spanish
 entity
 all
 to
 a


company
 I
 think
 from
 Norway
 who
 was


wellunded
 and
 believed
 in
 scooters.
 And


so
 we
 were
 able
 to
 flip
 that
 almost
 in


in
 a
 matter
 of
 a
 month
 or
 two.
 And
 that


business
 is
 still
 going.
 I
 still
 see


them
 in
 the
 news.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 we


didn't
 have
 so
 much
 luck
 in
 the
 United


States.
 We
 didn't
 find
 anybody


interested
 enough
 in
 the
 local
 business


here.
 And
 after
 a
 lot
 of
 searching
 and
 a


lot
 of
 bill
 paying
 and
 a
 lot
 of


landlords
 locking
 up
 the
 scooters,
 to
 my


knowledge,
 uh
 those
 scooters
 are
 still


sitting
 on
 the
 corners
 of
 Los
 Angeles


and
 Washington
 DC
 and
 maybe
 at
 the


bottom
 of
 the


>> unusable
 and
 and
 unusable
 because
 once


the
 technology
 gets
 turned
 off,


>> they're
 like
 bricks.


>> Wow.
 So
 good
 outcome
 in
 in
 Europe.
 I
 I


wish
 them
 well.


>> I
 like
 the
 scooters,
 but
 I
 do
 think
 that


there
 is
 this
 element
 of
 like
 sort
 of


weird
 public
 vandalism
 about
 it
 in
 some


point
 where
 like
 a
 company
 just
 thinks


it
 can
 deposit
 its
 products
 all
 around


neighborhoods.
 It's
 like
 what?
 Like


where
 did
 these
 come
 from?
 And
 then
 you


see
 them
 in
 ditches.
 Anyway,
 Tracy,
 keep


going.


>> I
 was
 going
 to
 ask
 so
 the
 scooters
 that


are
 left
 over,
 would
 the
 company
 be


liable
 for
 anything
 that
 like
 happened


to
 those
 or
 if
 they
 I
 don't
 know
 caused


an
 accident
 of
 some
 sort?
 If
 I'm
 cycling


down
 the
 the
 sidewalk
 and
 I
 accidentally


run
 into
 a
 defunct
 scooter,
 could
 I
 sue


the
 failed
 company?


>> Who
 would
 you
 sue?


>> The
 company,


>> but
 it
 doesn't
 exist
 anymore.
 So,
 I


can't.
 So,
 there's
 no


>> Oh,
 you
 can
 sue.
 Yes,
 you
 can
 sue
 all


day
 long,
 but
 there's
 nothing
 to


recover.


>> Okay.


>> That's
 both
 a
 blessing
 and
 a
 curse.
 I


remember
 when
 the
 scooters
 first
 came
 to


Los
 Angeles
 a
 few
 years
 ago,
 and
 people


would
 just
 throw
 them
 in
 the
 river,


throw
 them
 in
 the
 ocean.
 It
 was


astounding
 to
 me
 that
 that
 business


model
 could
 work.


>> Somebody
 believed
 in
 it.
 There
 are
 a
 lot


of
 those
 scooters
 still
 around
 Los


Angeles.
 And
 again,
 they're
 not
 useful


unless
 you
 have
 the
 technology
 active.


So,
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 happened.
 I
 I


wound
 up
 leaving
 that
 company
 before


that
 was
 fully
 resolved.
 But
 that
 is
 the


question.
 There
 were
 all
 sorts
 of


government
 penalties.
 Cities
 imposed


fines
 or
 wanted
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 had


insurance,
 for
 example,
 if
 we
 were
 going


to
 operate
 scooters.
 So,
 we're
 a
 little


bit
 hamstrung.
 We
 don't
 want
 to
 be


operating
 a
 scooter
 company.
 I've
 got
 a


small
 firm
 and
 I'm
 not
 staffed.
 I
 can


certainly
 rely
 on
 some
 of
 the
 former


employees
 if
 I
 can
 pay
 them,
 but
 I
 don't


want
 to
 be
 operating
 a
 company
 like


that.


>> I
 have
 just
 one
 last
 question,
 but
 one


particularly
 complicated
 and
 interesting


liquidation
 or
 sale
 or
 failure
 that's
 in


the
 news
 over
 the
 last
 several
 months


have
 been
 23
 in
 May,
 which
 raises
 all


kinds
 of
 interesting
 things
 about
 like


privacy
 in
 particular.
 I'm
 curious
 if


this
 is
 a
 story
 you
 followed
 and
 whether


you
 have
 any
 insight
 to
 bear
 on
 how
 a


situation
 like
 that
 will
 or
 should
 play


out
 from
 a
 legal
 perspective.


>> I
 followed
 it
 just
 a
 bit
 just
 enough
 to


know
 that
 I
 would
 not
 want
 to
 be
 making


the
 decisions
 as
 an
 asne
 in
 an
 ABC
 in


that
 case.
 That's
 a
 case
 that
 belongs
 in


bankruptcy
 court.


>> Okay?


>> Because
 you've
 got
 a
 judge
 who
 will
 make


the
 decisions
 for
 you.
 I
 don't
 want
 to


be
 responsible
 for
 selling
 personal


identifiable
 information
 without
 someone


telling
 me
 it's
 okay.


>> But
 actually
 imagine
 that
 in
 a
 I
 mean
 23


and
 me
 is
 an
 extreme
 example
 because


it's
 so
 personal.
 But
 I
 have
 to
 imagine


personal
 identifiable
 information
 is


actually
 got
 to
 be
 pretty
 common
 in
 a


lot
 of
 internet
 startups
 etc
 where


people
 have
 to
 submit
 information
 to
 set


up
 an
 account
 etc.
 I
 imagine
 that
 there


are
 a
 lot
 of
 maybe
 not
 quite
 as
 tricky


but
 still
 pretty
 tricky
 questions
 that


are
 raised
 with
 some
 of
 these
 companies.


>> We
 do
 have
 to
 take
 care.
 I
 I
 sold
 a


business
 earlier
 last
 year
 in
 the


ticketing.
 Actually,
 I've
 done
 four
 or


five
 deals
 in
 the
 ticketing
 business


like
 a
 StubHub
 type
 competitor.


>> And
 there
 are,
 of
 course,
 credit
 card


information
 and
 and
 personal


information.
 We
 don't
 generally
 sell


that.
 And
 so,
 as
 long
 as
 I'm
 careful


that
 it
 doesn't
 get
 disseminated
 out
 in


the
 public,
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 worry
 about


that
 too
 much.
 There
 is
 sometimes
 the


case
 if
 I
 sell
 a
 company,
 I
 have
 to


review
 their
 internet
 privacy
 policy
 to


make
 sure
 I'm
 able
 to
 sell
 the
 customer


list.
 Mhm.


>> And
 we
 do
 take
 that
 seriously
 and
 we
 do


work
 with
 council
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we


aren't
 going
 to
 be
 on
 the
 hook.


Certainly
 don't
 want
 to
 make
 those


decisions
 and
 have
 someone
 come
 back
 and


say
 I
 did
 something
 illegal.


>> I
 could
 sit
 here
 and
 listen
 to
 corporate


failure
 stories
 for
 hours,
 but
 we
 are


running
 out
 of
 time.
 So
 I'm
 just
 going


to
 ask
 one
 other
 question
 which
 is
 for


esoteric
 assets,


>> how
 do
 you
 go
 about
 ensuring
 that
 you


have
 that
 you're
 getting
 a
 reasonable


price?
 So
 something
 like
 human
 heads,
 I


imagine
 there
 is
 no
 secondary
 market
 for


human
 heads.
 There's
 no
 What
 I
 mean
 is


there's
 no
 exchange
 showing
 you
 a
 price.


>> There's
 no
 benchmark.


>> That's
 right.
 There's
 no
 benchmark
 human


head
 price.
 So
 someone
 could
 make
 you
 an


offer,
 but
 I
 imagine
 without
 expertise


in
 that
 particular
 market,
 you
 wouldn't


necessarily
 know
 if
 it
 was
 a
 good
 price


or
 not.
 So
 how
 do
 you
 go
 about
 making


sure
 that
 you're
 getting
 the
 most
 money


possible?


>> I
 get
 that
 question
 a
 lot
 and
 the
 answer


is
 there
 are
 no
 benchmarks.
 There's
 no


liquid
 market
 for
 these
 type
 of
 assets


that
 are
 very
 unique
 and
 very


interesting
 technology
 in
 some
 cases.


You
 have
 to
 ask
 the
 market.
 Something
 is


worth
 what
 someone
 else
 is
 willing
 to


pay
 for
 it.
 So,
 it's
 important
 that
 I


get
 the
 opportunity
 in
 front
 of


everybody
 who
 might
 have
 an
 interest.


That's
 why
 I
 said
 earlier
 50
 to
 100


people
 in
 that
 industry.
 And
 if
 I
 shop


it
 to
 all
 of
 the
 people
 who
 should
 know


what
 it
 is
 and
 how
 to
 value
 it,
 and
 they


say,
 "Sorry,
 I'm
 not
 interested."
 then
 I


can
 be
 pretty
 sure
 it's
 got
 no
 market


value
 today.
 If
 I
 get
 four
 or
 five


people
 to
 say,
 "Hey,
 this
 is


interesting.
 Let
 me
 do
 some
 homework.


Let
 me
 talk
 to
 management.
 Let
 me
 make


an
 offer."
 And
 I
 get
 four
 or
 five
 offers


and
 the
 offers
 are
 all
 centered
 around


$3
 million.
 Well,
 I've
 identified
 the


market
 value
 of
 that
 technology.
 If
 I've


got
 three
 offers
 at
 $500,000
 and
 one


offer
 at
 $5
 million,
 I'm
 going
 to
 grab


the
 $5
 million
 offer.
 That's
 the
 value


of
 the
 technology.
 So,
 I
 know
 better


than
 anybody
 else
 what
 that
 technology


is
 worth.
 In
 fact,
 I
 had
 to
 go
 to
 court


only
 one
 time,
 I
 think,
 in
 almost
 20


years
 where
 it
 was
 this
 co-apt
 case


again,
 I'll
 tell
 you
 that,
 where
 I
 sold


the
 technology
 for,
 let's
 call
 it,
 $3


million,
 and
 I
 repaid
 the
 secured
 lender


and
 there
 was
 no
 money
 for
 anybody
 else.


There
 was
 a
 plaintiff's
 attorney
 who
 was


representing
 some
 people
 who
 had
 said


that
 they
 were
 injured,
 not
 by
 this
 new


technology
 we
 discussed,
 but
 something


else
 the
 company
 had
 done,
 some
 kind
 of


dermapiller
 or
 something.
 And
 those


patients
 had
 potential
 claims,


contingent
 claims.
 They
 said
 they


suffered
 injury.
 They
 weren't


adjudicated.
 There
 were
 no
 judgments.


But
 the
 plaintiff's
 attorney
 may
 have


had
 a
 case
 as
 patients
 may
 have


suffered.
 Nevertheless,
 when
 we
 sold
 the


technology,
 there
 was
 enough
 money
 to


pay
 back
 the
 bank
 and
 nobody
 else.
 The


plaintiff's
 attorney
 took
 us
 to
 court


and
 they
 said,
 "Yes,
 you
 sold
 the


company
 for
 $3
 million,
 but
 if
 you
 know


what
 you
 were
 doing,
 Johnson,
 you
 would


have
 sold
 it
 for
 $11
 million
 and
 we
 all


would
 have
 gotten
 paid."


>> He
 says,
 "I
 have
 an
 ivory
 tower


economist
 right
 here
 at
 my
 desk."
 and
 he


says
 this
 company
 was
 worth
 $11
 million.


And
 I
 said,
 "Really?"
 He
 goes,
 "Here's


my
 binder.
 Here
 are
 the
 people
 that
 I


reached
 out
 to
 to
 sell
 this
 technology.


50,
 60,
 70
 of
 them.
 And
 here
 are
 the
 10


that
 said
 they
 were
 interested
 in


looking
 at
 it."
 And
 they
 signed


non-disclosure
 agreements.
 And
 after


doing
 their
 diligence,
 four
 of
 them
 came


to
 me
 with
 an
 offer
 to
 buy
 the
 company.


And
 I
 chose
 the
 one
 with
 the
 highest


price.
 So,
 if
 your
 ivory
 tower
 economist


wanted
 to
 buy
 this
 company
 for
 $11


million,
 I
 sure
 wish
 I
 would
 have
 met


it.
 I
 would
 have
 been
 happy
 to
 sell
 it


to
 him.
 But
 I
 know
 in
 the
 real
 world


that
 something
 is
 worth
 what
 someone's


willing
 to
 pay.
 And
 I
 asked
 everybody


and
 this
 is
 what
 they
 told
 me.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 one
 more
 question.
 I


can't
 resist,
 but
 is
 there
 a
 lesson


about
 corporate
 mortality
 that
 you
 wish


more
 executives
 or
 entrepreneurs
 would


learn
 and
 internalize?
 If
 you
 could
 give


a
 piece
 of
 advice
 to
 executives
 of


failing
 companies
 or
 companies
 that
 are


managing
 to
 survive,
 but
 there's
 always


a
 risk
 of
 failure,
 what
 would
 it
 be?


>> I
 won
 the
 court
 case.
 By
 the
 way,


>> I'll
 give
 you
 the
 same
 advice
 that
 that


everybody
 says.


Coming
 to
 us
 earlier
 rather
 than
 later


is
 always
 wise.


>> You
 only
 have
 as
 long
 as
 your
 cash


runway
 allows
 you
 to
 be
 there.


>> So,
 if
 you
 have
 six
 months
 worth
 of
 cash


instead
 of
 six
 weeks
 worth
 of
 cash,
 I


can
 do
 a
 more
 thorough
 search.
 I
 can


come
 up
 with
 potentially
 other
 buyers,


create
 more
 value,
 I
 can
 keep
 more


people
 around
 for
 a
 longer
 period
 of


time.
 I
 can
 make
 better
 preparations
 for


the
 preservation
 of
 the
 technology.
 So


earlier
 is
 always
 better.
 And
 I
 do
 a
 lot


of
 contingency
 planning.
 People
 come
 to


me
 and
 say,
 "I've
 got
 an
 offer
 on
 the


table,
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 going
 to


close.
 So,
 how
 do
 I
 prepare
 for
 the


downside?"
 Or,
 "We
 think
 we're
 going
 to


get
 that
 next
 round
 of
 venture
 funding,


but
 just
 in
 case
 it
 doesn't
 come
 in,


what
 do
 I
 do?"
 So,
 I
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 that


kind
 of
 planning.
 And
 the
 more
 time
 we


have,
 the
 better.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 I


have
 gotten
 the
 phone
 call
 before.
 I


can't
 make
 payroll
 on
 Friday.
 Can
 you


help
 me?


>> Should
 have
 called
 me
 earlier.
 David


Johnson,
 I
 think
 if
 I
 were
 on
 the
 board


of
 a
 company
 and
 you
 showed
 up
 and
 said,


you
 know
 what,
 tough
 situation,
 but


we're
 going
 to
 get
 you
 the
 max
 dollar.
 I


think
 I'd
 feel
 really
 good.
 I
 feel
 like


you'd
 do
 a
 good
 uh
 job
 for
 us.
 Really


appreciate
 you
 coming
 on
 OddLotss
 and


telling
 us
 about
 this
 niche
 that
 I
 knew


nothing
 about.
 This
 has
 been
 fun.
 Thank


you,
 Joe.
 Thank
 you,
 Tracy.


[Music]


[Music]


Tracy,
 that
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 fun.
 I
 didn't


know
 anything
 about
 any
 of
 this
 topic


and
 uh
 he
 was
 the
 perfect
 guest
 for


that.


>> Yes,
 a
 very
 niche
 topic
 for
 someone
 who


specializes
 sometimes
 in
 very
 niche


sales.
 That
 was
 so
 interesting.
 I'm


trying
 to
 think
 what
 my
 big
 takeaway
 is


here.
 I
 mean,
 I
 guess
 the
 emphasis
 on


how
 comfortable
 a
 lot
 of
 Silicon
 Valley


actually
 is
 with
 losing
 money
 for
 years


and
 years
 and
 years
 and
 then
 how


suddenly
 that
 tap
 can
 be
 turned
 off.


>> Well,
 so
 I
 thought
 your
 last
 question


and
 his
 last
 answer
 about
 like
 sooner


the
 better


>> was
 really
 interesting
 and
 really


important.
 And
 I
 just
 feel
 like
 if
 I


were
 a
 founder
 of
 a
 company,


>> I
 would
 never
 do
 sooner.
 I
 would
 hold


out
 till
 the
 very
 last
 second,
 the
 last


dollar
 in
 my
 account
 in
 order
 to
 make


payroll.
 I
 would
 never
 call
 David
 up


until
 I
 was
 absolutely
 forced
 out
 of
 the


room.


>> Even
 though,
 you
 know,
 you
 get
 into
 all


what
 do
 they
 call
 principal
 agent


problems
 here,
 right?
 Because
 you're


suddenly
 operating
 for
 yourself
 as


someone
 who's
 trying
 to
 keep
 your
 equity


in
 the
 money
 in
 the
 hopes
 that
 it
 can


going
 on.
 Meanwhile,
 you're
 burning


through
 credit
 or
 cash
 and
 probably,
 you


know,
 diminishing
 their
 recovery
 value


by
 the
 day.


a
 lot
 of
 interesting
 uh
 incentive


disalignment
 potential
 at
 the
 end
 of


life
 there.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 imagine
 that
 the
 founders
 of


startups
 that
 might
 eventually
 fail,


they're
 probably
 optimistic
 by
 nature


and
 so
 they're
 probably
 sat
 there


thinking
 they
 might
 get
 a
 hailmary
 at


the
 very
 last
 minute
 and
 then
 it
 doesn't


materialize
 and
 it's
 too
 late
 and


they're
 scrambling
 to
 make
 payroll.


>> I
 guess
 this
 is
 what
 the
 board,
 right?


The
 board
 is
 supposed
 to
 solve
 some
 of


these
 incentive
 alignment
 problems
 and


it's
 like,
 bro,
 come
 on.
 You
 got
 to
 give


up.
 you
 got
 to
 you
 got
 to
 begin
 the


liquidation
 phase,
 which
 I
 guess
 is
 why


the
 founder
 in
 one
 of
 his
 stories
 was


taking,
 you
 know,
 personal
 check
 cashing


loans
 to
 keep
 it
 going
 precisely
 because


the
 board
 maybe
 wouldn't
 have
 let
 it


keep
 going
 had
 they
 been
 aware
 of
 the


true
 financial
 state
 of
 the
 company.


Although
 anyway,
 very
 interesting


conversation,


>> bro.
 You
 got
 to
 give
 up
 signed
 the


chairman.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.


>> All
 right,
 shall
 we
 leave
 it
 there?


>> Let's
 leave
 it
 there.
