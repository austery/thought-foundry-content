I'm
 trying
 not
 to
 cry.
 I'm
 just
 like,


um,
 I
 hate
 suffering.
 I've
 suffered


myself
 and
 so
 I
 hate
 to
 see
 anybody


suffer.
 And
 so,
 um,
 this
 is
 my
 mission.


This
 is
 what
 I'm
 made
 for.
 And,
 um,
 I'm


just
 one
 guy.
 I
 can't
 do
 everything,
 but


I
 can
 do
 a
 lot.


Um,
 I
 always
 try
 to
 help
 people
 say,


"How
 can
 you
 turn
 your
 worst
 day
 into


your
 best
 day?"


>> Please
 help
 me
 welcome
 to
 the
 stage,


Tony
 Robbins.


He's
 the
 nation's
 number
 one
 life
 and


business
 strategist.


>> He's
 worked
 with
 royalty,
 elite


athletes,
 Oscar
 winners,
 scientists,
 and


everyone
 in
 between


>> to
 overcome
 their
 limitations
 and


accelerate
 change.


>> Can
 you
 take
 us
 back
 to
 the
 environment


that
 shaped
 you
 into
 the
 man
 that
 you


are?


>> So,
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 a
 tough
 environment.
 I


had
 four
 different
 fathers.
 My
 mom,
 she


drank
 alcohol
 and
 took
 prescription


drugs.
 We
 had
 no
 money,
 no
 food.
 And


then
 the
 thing
 that
 changed
 my
 whole


life
 was
 a
 knock
 on
 the
 door
 on


Thanksgiving.
 There
 was
 this
 tall
 guy


standing
 there
 with
 two
 bags
 of


groceries
 and
 an
 uncooked
 frozen
 turkey


in
 a
 pan.
 And
 my
 dad
 saw
 this
 man.
 He


said,
 "We
 don't
 take
 charity."
 And
 he


went
 and
 slammed
 the
 door
 on
 the
 guy.


But
 it
 became
 a
 very
 useful
 and


distinction
 for
 me
 about
 how
 he
 and
 I


process
 that
 day
 differently
 because


there's
 three
 decisions
 you
 make
 every


moment
 of
 your
 life.
 And
 the
 real


problem
 is
 the
 story
 you
 have.
 For


example,
 that
 day
 my
 dad's
 focus
 was
 the


fact
 he
 not
 fed
 his
 family
 and
 he
 was


worthless.
 However,
 I
 took
 that
 as


strangers
 care.
 And
 so
 the
 story
 is
 the


belief
 you've
 told
 yourself
 over
 and


over
 because
 belief
 is
 the
 invisible


force
 that
 controls
 everything
 in
 your


life.
 And
 then
 there's
 the
 third


decision.
 What
 am
 I
 going
 to
 do?
 And
 so


what
 I
 decided
 to
 do
 is
 someday
 I'm


going
 to
 do
 this
 for
 others
 and
 end


suffering
 where
 I
 can.
 And
 so
 I'm
 going


to
 show
 you
 how
 to
 get
 clear
 what
 you


really
 want.
 Figure
 out
 what's
 been


stopping
 you.
 Put
 the
 plan
 in
 place
 and


teach
 you
 the
 most
 important
 thing


that's
 made
 me
 successful.


>> And
 I
 don't
 think
 people
 fully
 realize


the
 significance
 of
 how
 many
 of
 the
 most


influential
 people
 on
 planet
 Earth
 you


have
 worked
 with
 and
 continue
 to
 work


with.
 What
 is
 the
 pattern
 that
 you


noticed
 in
 those
 people?


>> So,
 I
 found
 four
 things
 with
 them.
 And


the
 first
 thing
 is,


>> listen,
 my
 my
 team
 gave
 me
 a
 script
 that


they
 asked
 me
 to
 read,
 but
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 ask
 you
 um
 in
 the
 nicest
 way
 I


possibly
 can.

 had


so
 many
 dreams

 very
 fact
 that

 Thank
 you,


Tony.
 I
 was
 I
 was
 shocked.
 It
 was
 so


surprising
 to
 me
 that
 you
 had
 the


childhood
 you
 had
 based
 on
 the
 outcomes


that
 you've
 accomplished
 in
 your
 life.


And
 as
 someone
 that
 has
 followed
 you
 for


a
 very
 long
 time,
 I
 imagine
 that
 there's


many
 other
 people
 that
 have
 followed
 you


for
 a
 very
 long
 time
 that
 have
 no
 idea


about
 the
 early
 context.
 For
 those


people,


>> can
 you
 take
 us
 back
 to
 the
 environment


that
 shaped
 you
 into
 the
 man
 that
 you


are?


>> Well,
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 I
 grew
 up
 I


grew
 up
 in
 a
 tough
 environment.
 I
 had
 um


four
 different
 fathers.
 My
 mom
 was
 a


very
 intense
 and
 passionate
 woman.
 Uh
 we


never
 had
 any
 money.
 We're
 very
 very


poor.
 Uh
 my
 mom
 was
 probably
 the
 most


important
 influence
 in
 my
 life
 by
 far.


Um
 very
 loving
 woman
 but
 a
 very
 stressed


woman
 and
 under
 that
 stress
 she
 drank


alcohol
 and
 took
 prescription
 drugs
 and


when
 she
 did
 that
 she
 became
 very


violent.
 So
 I
 took
 the
 brunt
 of
 that
 and


then
 figured
 out
 how
 to
 manage
 her


emotions
 basically.
 Uh
 it's
 where
 all
 my


beginning
 training
 really
 happened
 and


yet
 at
 the
 same
 time
 she
 was
 loving
 it.


She
 pushed
 me.
 She
 believed
 in
 me.
 Uh


she
 wanted
 me
 to
 be
 something.
 So
 she


influenced
 my
 life
 in
 so
 many
 beautiful


ways.
 And
 then
 probably
 what
 changed
 my


life
 the
 most
 though
 is
 my
 forefather


especially
 made
 it
 clear
 no
 one
 gives
 a


damn
 about
 anybody
 else.
 We
 lived
 in
 a


um
 what
 I
 thought
 was
 an
 upper
 class
 uh


community
 or
 city
 but
 we
 were
 on
 the


other
 side
 of
 the
 tracks.
 It
 was
 lower


middle
 class
 and
 we
 were
 you
 know


literally
 right
 by
 the
 railroad
 tracks


where
 the
 worst
 of
 the
 worst
 live
 so
 to


speak.
 And
 so
 we're
 kind
 of
 looked
 down


on.
 And
 so
 it
 really
 looked
 like
 nobody


cares.
 And
 then
 the
 thing
 that
 changed


my
 whole
 life
 a
 single
 event
 was
 a
 knock


on
 the
 door
 on
 Thanksgiving.
 We
 had
 no


money,
 no
 food.
 When
 I
 say
 no
 food,
 we


had
 crackers
 and
 peanut
 butter,
 but
 not


a
 Thanksgiving
 dinner,
 right?
 And
 uh
 my


dad
 has
 been
 mom
 are
 screaming
 each


other
 through
 a
 door
 and
 my
 dad
 had
 lost


his
 job.
 You
 get
 the
 knock
 of
 the
 door


and
 I
 go
 open
 the
 door
 and
 there's
 this


tall
 guy
 standing
 there
 with
 two
 bags
 of


groceries,
 one
 in
 each
 hand,
 and
 at
 his


feet
 he
 had
 an
 uncooked
 frozen
 turkey
 in


in
 a
 pan,
 you
 know.
 And
 he
 said,
 "Is


your
 father
 here?"
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Just


one
 moment."
 You
 know,
 and
 I
 was
 like,


it
 was
 Christmas
 morning.
 So,
 I
 go
 to
 my


dad
 and
 I
 go,
 "Hey,
 Dad,
 there's
 someone


at
 the
 door
 for
 you."
 And
 he
 goes,
 "Who


is
 it?"
 And
 I
 said,
 "I
 don't
 know.
 It's


for
 you."
 He
 goes,
 "Well,
 you
 answered."


I
 said, "I
 already
 did.
 It's
 for
 you."


So,
 he
 goes
 over
 there
 and
 I'm
 waiting


like
 with
 such
 excitement
 for
 him
 to


open
 the
 door.
 And
 he
 saw
 this
 man
 and


he
 was
 not
 happy.
 He
 looked
 at
 this
 man


before
 the
 guy
 say
 a
 word
 and
 he
 said,


"We
 don't
 take
 charity."
 And
 he
 went
 and


slammed
 the
 door
 on
 the
 guy.
 But
 the
 man


had
 leaned
 in
 because
 of
 the
 groceries


and
 it
 hit
 his
 shoulder
 and
 it
 bounced


off,
 which
 made
 my
 dad
 even
 matter.
 And


they
 said,
 "Sir,
 sir,"
 he
 said,


"Somebody
 knows
 you're
 having
 a
 tough


time.
 Everyone
 has
 tough
 times.
 They


want
 you
 to
 have
 this
 food
 for
 your


family
 for
 Thanksgiving."
 He
 goes,
 "I'm


just
 the
 delivery
 guy."
 And
 my
 father


said,
 "We
 don't
 take
 charity."
 And
 he


pushed
 the
 door
 again.
 But
 this
 time,


because
 the
 guy's
 leaning,
 his
 foot
 now


has
 stepped
 in.
 It
 hit
 his
 foot
 and


bounced
 off.
 And
 then
 now
 my
 dad's


getting
 more
 fired
 up.
 And
 I'm
 standing


looking
 at
 this
 whole
 thing,
 and
 it's


like
 a
 car
 crash
 happening.
 And
 the
 guy


said
 something
 to
 my
 dad.
 I
 thought
 my


dad
 was
 going
 to
 punch
 him
 in
 the
 face.


He
 didn't
 say
 it
 meanly.
 He
 said,
 "Sir,"


he
 said,
 he
 saw
 me.
 He
 said, "Don't
 make


your
 family,
 you
 know,
 suffer
 because
 of


your
 ego."


And
 I
 can
 still
 see
 it
 like
 yesterday.


My
 dad's
 veins
 on
 both
 sides
 of
 his
 neck


were
 just
 pumping
 and
 he
 was
 red
 as
 can


be.
 And
 then
 he
 just
 dropped
 his


shoulders.
 He
 took
 the
 groceries.
 He


slammed
 it
 on
 the
 table
 and
 he
 slammed


the
 door.
 And
 he
 never
 even
 said
 thank


you.
 It
 took
 me
 maybe
 a
 decade
 to


eventually
 figure
 it
 out.
 And
 it
 became


a
 very
 useful
 and
 distinction
 for
 me


about
 how
 he
 and
 I
 process
 that
 day


differently
 because
 I
 believe
 there's


three
 decisions
 you
 make
 every
 moment
 of


your
 life.
 You're
 making
 them
 right
 now


if
 you're
 listening
 to
 me
 and
 so
 is
 your


audience.
 The
 first
 one
 is
 what
 are
 you


going
 to
 focus
 on?
 You're
 going
 to
 be


focused
 on
 what
 happened
 yesterday,
 what


you're
 going to
 have
 for
 lunch,
 what
 I'm


saying,
 how
 it
 relates
 to
 you.
 There
 are


millions
 of
 things
 you
 can
 focus
 on.
 But


you
 don't
 experience
 life.
 You


experience
 the
 life
 you
 focus
 on.
 And


most
 of
 us
 are
 distortion
 deletion


creatures.
 Our
 brains
 don't
 take
 it
 all


in
 consciously.
 it's
 too
 much.
 So
 our


brains
 delete
 things.
 We
 distort
 things.


We
 generalize
 things
 so
 we
 can
 make
 it


through
 our
 lives.
 And
 so
 if
 you
 don't


control
 your
 focus,
 you
 react.
 And
 that


day,
 my
 dad's
 focus
 was
 the
 fact
 he
 not


fed
 his
 family.
 It
 wasn't
 hard
 to
 figure


out.
 He
 said
 it
 over
 and
 over
 again


after
 after
 he
 slammed
 the
 door.
 And
 my


focus
 was,
 "Wow,
 there's
 food.
 What
 a


concept."
 You
 know,
 I
 was
 excited.
 But


the
 second
 decision
 you
 make
 every


moment,
 the
 minute
 you
 focus
 on


something,
 your
 brain
 has
 to
 figure
 out,


what
 does
 this
 mean?
 Is
 this
 the
 end
 or


the
 beginning?
 Is
 this
 person
 dissing


me?
 Is
 they
 are
 they
 challenging
 me?
 Are


they
 coaching
 me?
 Are
 they
 loving
 me?


And
 whatever
 meaning
 you
 give,
 it


produces
 emotion.
 And
 out
 of
 that


emotion,
 you
 make
 the
 third
 decision.


What
 am
 I
 going
 to
 do?
 And
 that
 day,
 I


know
 the
 meaning
 my
 dad
 did.
 It
 wasn't


just
 that
 he
 didn't
 feed
 his
 family.


It's
 that
 he
 was
 worthless.
 You
 know,
 I


can't
 even
 feed
 my
 family.
 And
 he


muttered
 all
 this
 stuff
 continuously.


But
 I
 I
 took
 that
 as
 stranger's
 care.
 It


completely
 violated
 everything
 I
 had


experienced
 in
 my
 life
 up
 until
 that


point.
 And
 my
 brain
 was
 like,
 if
 a


stranger
 doesn't
 even
 want
 credit
 for


this
 and
 they
 fed
 my
 family
 on


Thanksgiving,


I
 got
 to
 care
 about
 strangers.
 And
 so


what
 I
 decided
 to
 do
 is
 someday
 I'm


going
 to
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 this
 for


others.
 And
 so
 when
 I
 was
 17,
 I
 went
 out


and
 I
 uh
 I
 didn't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 money,


but
 was
 doing
 okay.
 And
 I
 went
 to
 a


grocery
 store
 and
 I
 told
 the
 manager


what
 happened
 in
 my
 life
 and
 I
 said,
 "I


want
 to
 feed
 two
 families.
 Help
 me
 out.


Give
 me
 a
 discount."
 And
 he
 gave
 me
 10%


off.
 And
 I
 thought,
 "Cheep
 bastard."
 But


I
 took
 it.
 I
 had
 the
 most
 enjoyable


shopping.
 I
 took
 two
 shopping
 carts
 and


just
 filled
 it
 up
 with
 two
 families.
 And


then
 I
 um
 I
 called
 this
 church
 and
 I


said,
 "Who
 do
 you
 know
 that
 needs
 help


but
 won't
 ask
 for
 it?
 Won't
 come
 for


it."
 And
 they
 gave
 me
 two
 families


names.
 And
 so
 I
 wrote
 a
 little
 note.
 I


just
 put
 this
 is
 a
 gift
 from
 a
 friend.


Everyone
 has
 tough
 times.
 I
 hope
 you


have
 a
 beautiful
 Thanksgiving
 and


someday
 if
 you
 can
 pay
 this
 forward.
 I


didn't
 use
 the
 word
 pay
 it
 forward.
 I


said
 do
 this
 for
 someone
 else.
 But
 now


you
 look
 at
 us
 pay
 it
 forward.
 and
 I
 put


love
 a
 friend.
 And
 then
 I
 I
 realized
 I


was
 going
 to
 the
 bario
 area
 of
 the
 city


and
 I
 was
 like
 maybe
 they
 don't
 speak


English.
 So
 I
 had
 a
 friend
 of
 mine
 write


in
 Spanish
 on
 the
 back.
 So
 I
 figured
 I


could
 flip
 it
 over.
 And
 I
 the
 first


house
 I
 went
 to,
 it's
 a
 little
 tiny


place.
 I
 knock
 on
 the
 door
 and
 this


woman
 about
 this
 tall
 asmatic
 woman
 sees


me
 and
 sees
 the
 food
 and
 screams
 and


then
 grabs
 my
 head
 and
 pulls
 it
 down,


starts
 kissing
 me
 on
 the
 cheek
 and
 said,


"No,
 no,
 no.
 Delivery
 boy,
 delivery


boy."
 And
 she
 and
 I
 and
 I
 pull
 out
 the


note
 and
 I
 flipped
 it
 over
 in
 Spanish


and
 she
 read
 it
 and
 then
 she
 started
 to


cry
 and
 she
 goes
 and
 she
 started
 giving


me
 kissing.
 I
 said,
 "No,
 deliver."
 She


goes,
 "No,
 gift
 of
 God.
 Gift
 of
 God."


And
 I'm
 trying
 not
 to
 cry,
 you
 know,


just
 like
 um
 I
 feel
 like
 it
 was


yesterday
 still.
 And
 so,
 um
 I
 the
 door


opened.
 It's
 a
 tiny
 little
 place
 size
 of


your
 kitchen
 here
 or
 reminder
 of
 your


kitchen.
 And
 um
 and
 I
 I
 was
 so
 excited


to
 start
 food
 down.
 All
 a
 sudden
 I
 heard


screams
 and
 then
 next
 thing
 I
 know
 I'm


hit
 by
 one
 and
 by
 another
 four
 boys.
 And


one
 hit
 one
 leg,
 one
 hit
 the
 other.
 They


saw
 the
 food
 they
 went
 crazy.
 Um
 and
 I


said,
 "Come
 help
 me."
 You
 had
 other


stuff
 in
 the
 van.
 And
 when
 they
 saw
 the


pumpkin
 pie,
 it
 was
 really
 over,
 you


know,
 and
 we
 bought
 all
 this
 food
 in
 and


it
 was
 time
 to
 go.
 And
 um
 the
 father
 had


left
 them.
 I
 found
 out
 later
 4
 days


before
 Thanksgiving
 with
 no
 money
 and
 no


food.
 And
 I'm
 anyway
 I'm
 looking
 through


the
 mirror
 and
 I
 just
 started
 crying


uncontrollably
 and
 I'm
 like
 why
 am
 I


crying
 so
 bad?
 This
 is
 such
 a
 beautiful


moment.
 And
 I
 just
 realized
 you
 know
 my


worst
 day
 of
 my
 life
 was
 really
 my
 best


day.
 That
 the
 day
 that
 was
 the
 most


painful
 to
 me
 cuz
 that
 father
 is
 the
 one


who
 he
 adopted
 me.
 I
 carry
 his
 name.
 um


that
 I
 wouldn't
 be
 there
 that
 day.
 I'm
 a


good
 human
 being,
 but
 you
 know,
 would
 I


work
 as
 hard
 as
 I
 worked
 to
 feed
 other


people?
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 next
 year
 I
 did


four,
 then
 eight,
 then
 12,
 then
 I
 had
 a


little
 company.
 I
 got
 my
 employees


involved.
 Then
 I
 got
 to
 a
 million


people,
 two
 million
 people.
 And
 then


about
 12
 years
 ago,
 I
 decided
 I
 want
 to


throw
 I
 want
 to
 feed
 a
 billion
 meals


here
 in
 the
 United
 States
 in
 10
 years.


And
 so,
 it's
 grown
 and
 grown
 and
 grown,


all
 from
 not
 being
 fed.
 And
 so,
 I
 I
 I


see
 it
 as
 a
 blessing.
 I
 see.
 I
 always


try
 to
 help
 people
 say,
 "How
 could
 you


turn
 your
 worst
 day
 into
 your
 best
 day?"


That's
 when
 life
 is
 really
 magical.


>> How
 many
 years
 has
 it
 been
 since
 you
 met


that
 young
 mother
 with
 her
 four


children?


>> I
 was
 17.
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 66.


>> Wow.
 50
 years.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 it
 still
 brings
 you
 to
 tears
 to


recount
 that.


>> It
 really
 does.


>> Why?
 Why
 is
 that?


>> Um
 I
 have
 a
 I
 hate
 suffering.
 I've


suffered
 myself
 and
 so
 I
 hate
 to
 see


anybody
 suffer.
 And
 so
 I'm
 unbelievably


driven
 to
 end
 suffering
 where
 I
 can
 to


help
 anyone
 do
 that.
 Whether
 it
 be


hunger
 or
 emotional
 hunger
 or
 depression


or
 sadness
 or
 relationship
 or
 I
 just
 I


don't
 know
 what
 it
 is.
 I
 just
 I
 love


human
 beings.
 I
 hate
 suffering
 and
 I


hate
 and
 I
 love
 to
 see
 when
 somebody


awakens
 to
 who
 they
 are.
 And
 we
 all
 are


so
 much
 more
 than
 we
 ever
 you
 know


perceive
 oursel
 to
 be.
 But
 many
 times


you
 don't
 discover
 that
 until
 you
 have


to.
 I
 like
 to
 try
 and
 show
 people
 how
 to


do
 it.
 So
 I
 have
 to
 wait
 till
 life
 hits


them.
 you
 know,
 anything
 you
 can


imagine.
 We're
 all
 going
 to
 go
 through


extreme
 stress
 in
 our
 lives,
 but
 how
 do


you
 do
 stress
 or
 distress?
 Use
 you.
 And


so,
 my
 whole
 thing
 is
 help
 people
 show


them
 how
 to
 use
 stress.
 Cuz
 I
 don't
 care


how
 good
 a
 person
 you
 are.
 I
 don't
 care


how
 spiritual
 or
 religious
 you
 are.
 I


don't
 care
 how
 smart
 you
 are,
 how
 rich


you
 think
 you
 are.
 Every
 human
 being
 is


going
 to
 go
 through
 extreme
 stress


multiple
 times
 in
 their
 life.
 And
 the


real
 question
 is,
 what
 are
 you
 gonna
 do


with
 it?
 And
 the
 first
 thing
 is,
 if


you're
 going
 through
 hell,
 keep
 going.


But
 if
 you
 keep
 going,
 you
 discover


number
 one
 how
 strong
 you
 really
 are.


Cuz
 if
 you
 don't
 give
 up,
 you'll


discover
 who
 you
 are.
 The
 second
 thing


you
 find
 out
 is
 who
 your
 real
 friends


are.
 Cuz
 when
 things
 aren't
 so
 great,


you
 get
 to
 see
 who
 those
 are.
 And
 then


third,
 it
 almost
 gives
 you
 like
 an


inoculation
 to
 future
 stress.
 Cuz
 like
 I


had
 a
 friend
 that
 was
 shot
 down
 in


Vietnam
 and
 was
 in
 a
 prison
 there
 for


seven
 years
 in
 solitary
 confinement.
 And


um
 Captain
 Coffee
 is
 his
 name.
 And
 I


remember
 I
 met
 him
 later
 in
 life
 and
 he


was
 going
 through
 this
 tough
 thing
 with


the
 IRS
 and
 it
 was
 so
 unfair.
 It
 took


him
 three
 years.
 He
 got
 his
 money
 back.


But
 I
 said,
 "Doesn't
 that
 drive
 you


crazy?"
 He
 goes,
 "After
 being
 with
 the


North
 Vietnamese,"
 he
 goes,
 "You
 know,


what
 could
 the
 IRS
 do
 to
 me?"
 You
 know,


so
 I
 think
 those
 pieces
 are
 there.
 But


everyone
 gets
 called
 on
 the
 journey.


Most
 people
 try
 to
 resist
 it,
 but
 that


journey,
 that's
 what
 the
 call
 is.
 It's
 a


call
 to
 grow.
 So
 I'm
 I'm
 big
 on
 change


your
 story,
 change
 your
 life.
 And
 I'm


big
 on
 understanding
 the
 narrative
 of


where
 you
 are
 in
 the
 story
 of
 your
 life.


Because
 if
 you
 understand
 where
 you
 are,


it
 gives
 context.
 It
 gives
 meaning
 and


it
 doesn't
 make
 you
 feel
 overwhelmed.


>> Had
 your
 mother
 not
 suffered
 in
 such
 a


way,
 do
 you
 think
 this
 would
 be
 so


important
 to
 you
 had
 you
 not
 observed


that
 suffering?


>> Yeah.
 No,
 I
 I
 I
 I've
 often
 said
 I'm
 like


I
 said
 earlier,
 I
 think
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 good


human
 being.
 I
 think
 I
 still
 to
 help


people,
 but
 would
 I
 providing
 62
 billion


meals
 and
 working
 around
 the
 clock
 on


top
 of,
 you
 know,
 my
 114
 companies
 and


all
 that?
 No,
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 would.
 And


that
 hunger
 comes
 very
 often
 from
 pain.


But
 pain's
 not
 enough
 to
 keep
 you
 going.


Pain
 only
 goes
 so
 far.
 You've
 got
 to


find
 something
 that
 it's
 like
 I
 I
 tell


people
 there's
 two
 types
 of
 motivation,


right?
 There's
 push
 motivation.
 You


know,
 you're
 making
 something
 happen.


And
 I
 have
 enormous
 willpower.
 I'm
 sure


you
 do.
 Most
 of the
 people
 we
 probably


interact
 with
 have
 great
 willpower,


right?


>> But
 there's
 still
 a
 limit
 to
 it.
 But


there's
 no
 limit
 to
 pole
 motivation.


Pole
 is
 there's
 something
 so
 magnificent


you
 want
 to
 serve
 something
 that
 you


care
 about
 more
 than
 yourself.
 That's


where
 all
 the
 energy
 in
 life
 comes
 from.


You
 know
 what's
 in
 your
 heart
 and
 your


soul.
 What
 wakes
 you
 up
 in
 the
 morning


and
 makes
 you
 go.
 And
 I
 think
 if
 I


hadn't
 had
 the
 pain,
 I
 don't
 think
 I


would
 have
 been
 sensitized.
 But
 I
 also


if
 I
 hadn't
 felt
 the
 pleasure
 of
 serving


and
 seeing
 impact
 on
 such
 a
 large
 scale,


then
 you
 know,
 you'd
 be
 limited
 because


you
 listen,
 meeting
 your
 own
 needs
 is


not
 that
 hard.
 Like
 I
 my
 biggest
 beef


with
 right
 now
 is
 since
 co
 is
 this
 whole


self-care
 revolution
 we've
 got.
 I
 mean,


you
 got
 to
 take
 care
 of
 yourself.
 Don't


get
 me
 wrong.
 I
 take
 care
 of
 myself.
 And


you
 know,
 you
 get
 weaker
 and
 weaker
 the


more
 you
 focus
 on
 yourself.
 The
 human


mind
 is
 always
 going
 to
 figure
 out


something
 that
 isn't
 good
 enough.
 But


when
 you're
 serving,
 you're
 not
 there.


Like
 your
 mind's
 not
 there.
 You're
 with


the
 people.
 You're
 with
 what
 you're


doing.
 And
 it's
 the
 escape
 from
 the


mind's
 reductionism.
 And
 so
 I
 really


believe
 that
 people
 the
 secret
 to
 life


is
 to
 find
 something
 you
 care
 about
 more


than
 yourself
 that
 gives
 you
 that
 pull


motivation.
 And
 then
 you're
 never
 going


to
 lack
 for
 energy.
 You're
 never
 going


to
 lack
 for
 passion.
 You're
 never
 going


to
 lack
 for
 anything.
 And
 you're
 going


to
 have
 a
 life
 that's
 extremely


meaningful.
 It's
 not
 happy
 every
 moment


there.
 They're
 not
 meant
 to
 be.
 If
 you


smile,
 have
 you
 ever
 smiled
 so
 much
 face


hurt?


>> You
 know,
 we
 need
 variety.
 So
 you
 But


meaning
 that's
 something
 you
 can
 find
 no


matter
 what.


>> I
 asked
 you
 before
 we
 started
 recording


um
 a
 question
 I
 almost
 never
 ask
 any
 of


my
 guests,
 which
 is
 what
 is
 the
 thing


that
 we
 should
 be
 talking
 about
 the


most?
 and
 you
 told
 me,
 you
 know,
 shortly


after
 um
 what
 your
 answer
 was,
 but
 you


know,
 even
 shortly
 after
 that,
 you
 then


went
 on
 to
 talk
 to
 me
 about
 how
 you're


driven
 to
 end
 suffering.
 Now,
 if
 I


compare
 these
 two
 answers,
 the
 answer


you
 gave
 me
 to
 the
 question
 I
 asked


about
 what's
 the
 most
 important
 thing


for
 us
 to
 be
 talking
 about
 and
 your


second
 point
 about
 your
 desire
 to
 end


suffering,
 there's
 probably
 some
 kind
 of


overlap.


>> There
 is.
 Yeah.
 So,
 if
 I
 were
 to
 ask
 you


just
 for
 because
 we
 weren't
 recording


then,
 what
 you
 think
 maybe
 the
 most


consequential
 thing
 we
 should
 be
 talking


about
 right
 now
 is
 as
 it
 relates
 to


suffering
 and
 everything
 that's
 going
 on


in
 society,
 what
 would
 that
 answer
 be?


>> I
 think
 it's
 uh
 AI,
 but
 it's
 not
 just


AI,
 it's
 nanotechnology,
 it's
 how


technology,
 the
 rapid
 change
 in


technology
 and
 if
 you
 don't
 believe
 it's


going
 to
 destroy
 humanity
 and
 it's
 going


to
 liberate
 us
 from
 a
 lot
 of
 labor,
 if


you
 believe
 that,
 the
 ones
 that
 promote


that
 concept.
 If
 that
 does
 happen
 and
 we


displace
 this
 many
 jobs
 in
 this
 short
 a


period
 of
 time,
 jobs
 are
 not
 just
 money.


Jobs
 are
 meaning.
 It's
 not
 the
 only
 form


of
 meaning,
 but
 it's
 meaning.
 So,
 it's


like
 you
 talk
 about,
 well,
 we'll
 do
 give


people
 UBI
 and
 okay,
 I
 think
 you
 might


have
 to
 because
 the
 changes
 are
 going
 to


happen
 so
 rapidly.
 Like
 I
 said,
 you


know,
 farming,
 80%
 of
 us
 were
 farmers


150
 years
 ago.
 Now,
 it's
 3%.
 We
 feed
 the


world.
 That's
 a
 long
 transition.
 Uh,
 I


think
 I
 mentioned
 to
 you
 off
 the
 air


here,
 I
 was
 visiting
 with
 President


Obama
 10
 years
 ago
 and
 towards
 the
 end


of
 his
 term
 there
 and
 I
 was
 saying,


"Hey,
 I
 just
 got
 to
 talk
 to
 you.
 You


know,
 you
 inherited
 a
 pretty
 tough


economy
 from
 the
 original
 2008
 explosion


breakdown.
 We
 lost
 8
 million
 jobs."
 So,


I
 said,
 "There's
 technology
 coming
 right


now
 that
 we
 can
 predict
 is
 going
 to


displace
 more
 than
 those
 8
 million


jobs."
 And
 I
 talked
 to
 him
 at
 that
 time


just
 about
 I
 said,
 "Just
 take
 one
 like


self-driving
 cars."
 We
 were
 just


starting
 to
 come
 out.
 I
 said, "In
 the


next
 10,
 12,
 13,
 14
 years,
 they're
 going


to
 become
 ubiquitous."
 And
 I
 said,


"There's
 8
 million
 truck
 drivers,
 Uber


drivers,
 and
 taxi
 drivers.
 And
 are
 you


doing
 anything
 to
 retool
 them?"
 I
 said,


"Because


>> just
 in
 the
 US,


>> just
 in
 the
 US."
 I
 said,
 "Because
 if
 you


don't,
 think
 about
 this.
 If
 I'm
 a


business
 person
 and
 I
 can
 hire
 a
 person


to
 drive
 a
 truck
 only
 eight
 hours
 a
 day,


I
 have
 to
 pay
 for
 the
 healthcare,
 which


gets
 more
 expensive
 every
 year.
 Um,


they're
 going
 to
 [ __ ]
 at
 me
 about


things.
 And
 I
 can
 buy
 a
 truck
 that
 can


drive
 24
 hours
 a
 day.
 My
 insurance
 is


cheaper
 because
 it
 doesn't
 make
 mistakes


and
 I
 can
 depreciate
 the
 asset.
 Am
 I


going
 to
 hire
 anybody?
 I
 said,
 so
 those


jobs
 going
 to
 go
 that's
 8
 million.


That's
 one
 sector.
 We
 could
 look
 at


pharma.
 There's
 so
 many
 industries


affected.
 So
 I
 said,
 we've
 got
 to
 retool


those
 people
 now
 where
 there's
 10
 years


to
 gear
 them
 up
 because
 these
 are
 not


people
 that
 are
 going
 to
 do
 it
 on
 their


own
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 shocked.
 The


shock
 to
 their
 system.
 The
 loss
 of


dignity
 of
 of
 being
 in
 control
 agency
 of


their
 own
 life,
 of
 their
 own
 job,
 of


their
 own
 direction
 is
 huge.
 And
 if
 you


go
 back
 to
 like
 the
 Ludites,
 you
 know,


you're
 from
 the
 UK,
 right?
 You
 must
 know


your
 history
 there.
 1800s,
 you
 know,


Merkantile,
 they
 come
 up
 with
 these


machines
 and
 how
 did
 people
 react?
 And


by
 the
 way,
 this
 story
 is
 the
 same


across
 history.
 We
 have
 a
 radical
 change


like
 this.
 All
 these
 people
 are


displaced
 and
 what
 did
 they
 do?
 They


rioted.
 They
 took
 hammers
 and
 they


destroyed
 those
 machines.
 They


threatened
 to
 kill
 the
 owners
 of
 those


companies
 and
 some
 were
 shot
 and
 killed.


They
 blew
 up
 and
 firebomb
 places.
 And


what
 did
 the
 UK
 uh
 you
 know
 do
 about


this?
 They
 passed
 a
 law
 in
 the
 first


year
 of
 this
 of
 these
 ludites
 saying
 you


destroy
 machine,
 it's
 capital


punishment.
 They
 hung
 people
 because


they
 couldn't
 have
 them
 destroy
 the


growth
 of
 the
 of
 the
 economy,
 right?
 And


guess
 what?
 15
 years
 later,
 the
 same


thing
 happened
 again
 with
 the
 thrashers.


thrasher
 machines
 that
 were
 used
 for


wheat
 and
 they
 lost
 all
 the
 jobs
 and
 the


people
 and
 the
 government
 overreacted.


I'm
 not
 trying
 to
 be
 overly
 dramatic,


but
 if
 anything
 this
 transition
 is
 just


going
 to
 be
 smooth
 by
 us
 doing
 nothing,


they're
 wrong.
 And
 the
 problem
 is,
 as
 I


mentioned
 to
 you
 before,
 I
 think
 the


leverage
 is
 not
 in
 favor
 of
 us
 taking


care
 of
 society.
 The
 leverage
 is
 the


carrot
 and
 the
 stick.
 The
 carrot
 is
 I


can
 make
 a
 trillion
 dollars
 if
 I
 have


the
 right
 LLM
 or,
 you
 know,
 if
 I
 get
 to


artificial
 general
 intelligence.
 Who


knows?
 And
 if
 we
 don't
 do
 it,
 China's


going
 to
 do
 it.
 That's
 the
 stick.
 And


then
 they're
 going
 to
 run
 the
 world.
 So


there's
 no
 focus
 on
 safety
 virtually,
 as


you
 well
 know.
 And
 there's
 certainly
 no


focus
 on
 what's
 happening
 with
 these


jobs.
 Right
 now,
 high
 school
 students


are
 getting
 jobs
 more
 than
 college


students
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 50
 years,


right?
 You
 see
 the
 displacement.
 You


know,
 you
 got
 friends
 just
 like
 I
 do.


Mark
 Benoff's
 one
 of
 my
 dear
 friends.


They
 let
 go
 of
 like
 what
 was
 it?
 I
 think


it
 was
 was
 it
 5,000
 customer
 service


agents
 and
 now
 it's
 done
 with
 AI
 now.


Now
 he
 wants
 to
 elevate
 them
 to
 other


jobs.
 So
 we
 have
 to
 look
 at
 what
 this


means
 to
 our
 society.
 We
 have
 to


anticipate
 what
 this
 means
 and
 we've
 got


to
 retool
 not
 just
 the
 jobs
 but
 the


psychology
 because
 people
 talk
 about
 a


post-work
 world.
 You
 hear
 people
 talk


about
 this
 all
 the
 time.
 Elon,
 people


like
 that.
 They
 labor
 is
 not
 like


electricity.
 You
 just
 take
 it
 for


granted.
 It's
 so
 cheap.
 It's
 so
 easy.


Well,
 if
 that's
 true,
 and
 he's
 talking
 3


to
 5
 years,
 and
 a
 lot
 of people
 say


Elon's
 early,
 he
 usually
 is
 uh
 in
 his


predictions,
 but
 Ray
 Kerszwell
 is
 a
 good


friend
 of
 mine.
 He's
 the
 most
 accurate


predictor
 of
 technology
 in
 history.
 And


he's
 been
 saying
 2029
 for
 almost
 20


years
 is
 when
 we
 have
 artificial
 general


intelligence.
 If
 you
 go
 to
 Hinton,
 I


think
 you've
 interviewed
 Hinton,
 haven't


you?
 Right.
 So,
 he's
 the
 longest.
 He's


saying
 2030
 to
 2040.
 He's
 given
 us
 a


little
 more
 room.
 In
 the
 next
 3
 to
 10


years,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 happen.
 How
 are


we
 prepared
 for
 this?


And
 so
 this
 is
 the
 questions
 I'm
 trying


to
 bring
 up
 to
 people
 that
 have


influence
 to
 say
 if
 you're
 in
 business,


you
 got
 to
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this.
 If


you're
 in
 government,
 you
 got
 to
 take
 a


look
 at
 this.
 And
 so
 I
 I
 just
 got
 um


they
 haven't
 announced
 yet,
 but
 I
 just


got
 selected
 to
 be
 on
 the
 federal


advisory
 committee
 for
 the
 president
 and


for
 the
 health
 and
 human
 services
 and


I'm
 on
 the
 mental
 health
 side
 and
 I'm


hoping
 to
 use
 that
 position
 to
 bring


more
 of
 government's
 focus
 into
 this


category
 as
 well
 because
 it's
 it's
 got


to
 be
 addressed


>> when
 we
 recite
 these.
 And
 that's
 by
 the


way
 the
 answer
 to
 your
 question
 is
 and


that's
 suffering.


>> That's
 suffering
 at
 the
 highest
 level.


Not
 just
 financial
 suffering.
 That's


emotional
 suffering.
 That's
 loss
 of


identity
 suffering.
 If
 I
 am
 a
 coder,
 I


am
 a
 truck
 driver
 and
 I
 lose
 who
 I
 am.


Now
 I
 just
 want
 to
 say
 one
 last
 thing.


We've
 already
 been
 in
 a
 postwork
 world


because
 I
 one
 person
 said
 to
 me


recently,
 well,
 for
 4,000
 years
 we
 tied


our
 identity
 to
 our
 work.
 I
 said,
 no,


Americans
 all
 go,
 what
 do
 you
 do?
 Not


everybody
 in
 the
 world
 does
 that.
 And


for
 4,000
 years,
 our
 connection
 post


before
 the
 agricultural
 revolution
 was


really
 what
 tribe
 we're
 connected
 to.


And
 our
 sense
 of
 significance
 was
 maybe


our
 courage
 in
 battle,
 not
 our
 financial


component.
 Or
 maybe
 it
 was
 our


creativity,
 our
 poetry,
 our
 storytelling


capacity,
 or
 maybe
 it
 was
 our


generosity.
 Um
 maybe
 it
 was
 our
 wisdom.


So
 we
 can
 find
 other
 things
 to
 have


meaning
 besides
 a
 job.
 But
 if
 you
 don't


take
 a
 culture
 that's
 been
 conditioned


for
 200
 years
 to
 think
 a
 certain
 way,


we're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 pain.
 And
 I


would
 like
 to
 see
 us
 have
 less
 of
 that


if
 we
 could.
 And
 I'm
 only
 one
 person,


but
 I'll
 do
 my
 best
 to
 help
 people
 make


that
 transition.


>> It's
 funny
 because
 when
 we
 think
 about


those
 historical
 examples
 of
 transition,


I
 for
 many
 reasons
 think
 this
 is
 even


more
 extreme.


>> I
 agree.


>> Because
 you
 have
 intelligence
 and
 you


have
 you've
 basically
 disrupted
 both
 the


muscles
 and
 the
 mind.
 But
 you
 know
 if


the
 reason
 it's
 going
 to
 explode
 even


faster
 is
 because
 we're
 moving
 from
 LLM


to
 now
 actually
 studying
 visually
 what's


happening
 in
 the
 real
 world.
 And
 when


robots
 do
 that
 then
 the
 game
 changes


their
 tempo
 of
 learning.
 And
 just
 think


about
 this.
 You
 and
 I
 are
 having
 a


conversation.
 I
 picked
 up
 one
 of your


books
 here
 and
 I'm
 reading
 through
 your


book.
 So
 I
 want
 to
 get
 a
 feel
 for
 who


you
 are
 and
 everything
 else
 before
 I


came
 here.
 I've
 seen
 some
 of
 your
 videos


but
 and
 I
 know
 like
 I
 really
 enjoyed
 it.


But
 I
 had
 to
 go
 get
 that.
 I
 had
 to
 take


a
 couple
 hours
 to
 dig
 through
 that.
 You


and
 I
 have
 a
 conversation.
 If
 either
 one


of
 us
 learn
 something
 we're
 a
 machine.


every
 machine
 knows
 it
 instantly.
 You


push
 one
 button
 and
 they
 have
 all
 of


that
 knowledge.
 There's
 none
 of
 this


word
 transfer.
 It's
 just
 it's
 now.
 So,


people
 don't
 realize
 what
 this
 really


means.
 And
 when
 you're
 learning
 from
 the


real
 world,
 not
 just
 LLMs,
 right
 now,


you
 and
 I
 are
 our
 brains
 are
 predictive


devices.
 They're
 predicting
 what
 is


going
 to
 happen
 next
 to
 the
 best
 of
 our


ability.
 And
 we're
 trying
 to
 close
 that


gap
 as
 much
 as
 we
 can
 or
 we
 get
 jolted.


Well,
 think
 how
 predictively
 that's


going
 to
 do
 to
 people's
 heads
 when
 all


of a
 sudden
 their
 labor
 is
 not
 needed.


>> And
 it's
 no
 longer
 blue
 collar
 labor,


which
 is
 what
 people
 thought
 it
 would


be.
 It's
 white
 collar
 labor.
 I
 mean,


like
 my
 financial
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 I
 have


uh
 I
 own
 95
 different
 private
 equity


firms.
 I
 have
 own
 the
 firms,
 not
 the


actual
 funds,
 right?
 So,
 I
 get
 to
 do
 and


20
 of
 them
 and
 I
 got
 pieces
 of
 all
 of


them.
 So,
 they're
 biggest
 in
 the
 world.


And
 so,
 I
 get
 to
 take
 a
 look
 at
 some
 of


the
 things
 that
 are
 happening
 so
 fast.


And
 I
 look
 at
 all
 those
 jobs
 and
 I
 see


people
 in
 those
 industries
 and
 quantum


is
 taking
 it
 took
 over
 maybe
 five
 years


ago.
 I've
 seen
 the
 shrink
 in
 these


offices
 from
 staffs
 the
 guys
 who
 are


making
 5
 million
 $10
 million
 a
 year
 that


are
 now
 unemployed.
 Right?
 It's
 not
 just


the
 blue
 collar
 worker.
 It's
 everyone.


So
 you're
 right.
 This
 has
 never
 happened


before
 in
 history.
 And
 what's
 being
 done


about
 it?


>> More
 money's
 been
 put
 into
 it
 to


accelerate
 it.


>> The
 carrot
 and
 stick,
 the
 trillionaire


and
 China,
 those
 two
 pieces
 are
 driving


it
 all.
 And
 a
 few
 people
 are
 trying
 to


hammer
 like
 Hinton
 and
 a
 few
 other


people.
 We
 got
 to
 work
 on
 safety
 here
 so


it
 doesn't
 eliminate
 the
 human
 race.
 And


I'm
 not
 a
 reactionary
 person,
 but
 you


know
 of
 what
 is
 it
 25
 30%
 of
 them
 people


that
 work
 in
 AI
 say
 that
 they
 think
 it


could
 potentially
 do
 that.
 I
 mean
 like


you
 could
 use
 electricity
 to
 kill
 people


or
 light
 up
 a
 city.
 So
 all
 technology
 is


that
 challenge.
 But
 this
 is
 a
 different


technology.
 This
 is
 a
 technology
 that


keeps
 learning
 can
 replicate
 itself.


Right
 now
 they
 don't
 even
 know
 how
 some


of
 this
 actually
 works.
 They
 don't
 know


how
 the
 AI
 is
 actually
 working.
 It's


teaching
 itself.
 These
 AIs
 now
 have


their
 own
 language.
 I'm
 sure
 you
 know


they're
 talking
 no
 longer
 in
 English
 to


each
 other.
 And
 you
 know,
 I'm
 sure


you've
 seen
 the
 studies,
 right,
 where


they
 give
 them
 information
 on
 in
 the


email
 and
 then
 they
 say
 they're
 going
 to


shut
 shut
 off
 the
 AI
 and
 it
 blackmails


them
 by
 giving
 them
 they
 g
 information


about
 somebody
 having
 an
 affair
 and
 it


blackmails
 them.
 I
 mean,
 it
 lies.
 So,


we're
 we're
 living
 in
 a
 crazy
 world


where
 the
 opportunity
 is
 greater
 than


any
 time
 in
 his
 history
 for
 us
 to
 be


creators.
 We
 were
 created
 and
 we're


meant
 to
 create
 and
 we've
 got
 tools
 to


create
 like
 never
 before.
 But
 we
 we're


going
 to
 have
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 as
 we're


doing
 that,
 we've
 got
 some
 parameters


around
 safety
 and
 some
 parameters
 about


what
 does
 it
 do
 to
 society.
 And
 I
 don't


have
 the
 perfect
 answers
 for
 it.
 But
 I


do
 know
 one
 thing,
 retooling
 is
 the


answer.
 And
 I
 don't
 believe
 most
 people


will
 be
 replaced
 by
 an
 AI.
 They'll
 be


replaced
 by
 somebody
 who
 knows
 how
 to


use
 AI.


>> Yeah.
 One
 of
 the
 things
 you
 said
 there


really
 blew
 my
 mind
 when
 I
 watched
 a


video
 from
 Boston
 Dynamics
 this
 week


where
 they
 the
 guy
 explained
 how
 these


robots
 are
 going
 to
 learn.
 And
 he
 goes


there's
 two
 ways.
 One
 way
 is
 we're
 going


to
 get
 our
 factory
 workers
 to
 wear
 a


suit
 and
 every
 time
 the
 factory
 worker


does
 something
 the
 the
 all
 the
 robots


are
 going
 to
 learn
 that
 thing.
 And
 the


other
 thing
 is
 he
 said
 is
 if
 one
 of
 our


robots
 learns
 something
 whether
 it's
 how


to
 pick
 up
 a
 book
 or
 how
 to
 make
 an


omelette
 every
 robot
 learns
 it


instantaneously.
 And
 my
 mind
 was
 like


wow
 that
 is
 I
 personally


don't
 know
 where
 this
 leaves
 us.
 to
 well


neither
 do
 I
 but
 there
 are
 certain


things
 you
 know
 it's
 leading
 us
 towards


you
 know
 it's
 going
 to
 lead
 us
 to
 a


great
 deal
 of
 violence
 because
 there
 are


going
 to
 be
 people
 like
 have
 always


happened
 with
 technology
 displaces
 them


only
 this
 is
 going to
 be
 a
 global
 event


across
 multiple
 areas
 and
 not
 just


drivers
 of
 Ubers
 and
 truck
 drivers
 if
 we


don't
 get
 our
 act
 together
 and
 have
 a


plan
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 violence
 for


some
 period
 of
 time
 there'll
 be
 there's


that
 grief
 period
 of
 loss
 and
 that


people
 go
 through
 when
 something
 jars


them
 that
 much
 and
 some
 people
 don't


return
 from
 that
 grief.
 And
 some
 people


are
 going to
 take
 this
 technology
 and


they're
 going
 to
 go
 off.
 It's
 already


happening
 now
 even
 without
 AI.
 There
 are


more
 males
 at
 home
 25
 to
 35
 living
 at


home
 with
 their
 family
 not
 working
 than


any
 time
 in
 human
 history
 including
 the


depression.
 Right?
 There
 are
 I
 think


it's
 25%
 or
 I
 think
 it
 was
 30%
 I
 forgot


the
 number.
 I
 just
 saw
 it
 recently
 of


young
 men
 have
 never
 approached
 a
 woman


to
 ask
 her
 out
 for
 a
 date.
 They
 play


video
 games
 all
 day
 long.
 their
 mom
 does


their
 laundry
 and
 they
 order
 Uber
 Eats.


This
 is
 a
 mass
 number
 of
 people.
 That's


just
 the
 technology
 of
 getting
 somebody


gamified.
 Imagine
 with
 AI.
 So,
 some


people
 are
 going
 to
 go
 live
 there
 and


some
 people
 are
 going
 to
 go
 the
 Star


Trek
 route
 and
 say,
 "I'm
 going
 to
 figure


out
 what
 makes
 human
 existence
 be
 here."


But
 it's
 not
 hard
 to
 figure
 out.
 The


majority
 are
 not
 going
 to
 go
 the
 Star


Trek
 route.
 And
 so,
 we've
 got
 to
 have
 a


bridge
 because
 of
 the
 time
 compression.


If
 this
 was
 a
 hundred
 years
 to
 do
 it,
 we


could
 adjust.
 There
 will
 be
 more
 jobs.


There'll
 be
 new
 jobs.
 There'll
 be
 new


time.
 But
 it's
 the
 time
 frame
 that
 I'm


most
 concerned
 about.
 So
 when
 you
 ask
 me


what
 I'm
 concerned
 about,
 that's
 what


I'm
 concerned
 about
 because
 it
 creates


suffering.
 And
 it's
 something
 that
 we


can
 predict
 is
 going
 to
 create


suffering.
 And
 yet
 I
 see
 very
 few
 people


in
 positions
 of
 influence
 and
 power


doing
 much
 about
 it.


>> So
 on
 an
 individual
 level,
 if
 you
 were


an
 18-year-old
 Tony
 Robbins,
 what
 would


you
 be
 doing
 at
 this
 moment?
 What
 would


you
 be
 focusing
 on
 work-wise?
 How
 would


you
 be
 designing
 your
 life
 for
 such
 a


world?


>> I
 have
 five
 kids
 and
 five
 grandkids,


right?
 So,
 I
 have
 a
 52-year-old
 daughter


and
 I
 have
 a
 thanks
 to
 CO
 a
 4-year-old


daughter.
 So,
 CO
 was
 good
 to
 me.
 I
 was


home.
 So,
 um
 I
 look
 at
 my
 my
 especially


my
 grandkids
 and
 my
 daughter
 and
 I
 say


they're
 entering
 a
 world
 that
 none
 of
 us


have
 known
 before.
 And
 so,
 how
 do
 I
 arm


them
 for
 it?
 And
 the
 answer
 is
 a
 couple


of
 things.
 Number
 one,
 I
 have
 to
 teach


them
 not
 to
 do
 what
 most
 people
 in
 the


world
 do.
 Most
 people
 you
 talk
 to
 of
 any


even
 quote
 successful
 people,
 whatever


that
 means,
 they're
 stressed
 all
 the


time.
 Stress.
 I'm
 so
 stressed.
 You
 hear


people
 talk
 about
 stress
 all
 the
 time.


It's
 like
 they
 argue
 about
 who's
 more


stressed.
 And
 I
 I
 look
 at
 that
 and
 go,


why
 are
 they
 stressed?
 And
 the
 answer
 is


because
 they're
 managing
 their
 life.


We're
 not
 made
 to
 manage
 circumstances.


We're
 made
 to
 create.
 We
 were
 created
 by


something.
 Call
 it
 your
 creator.
 Call
 it


the
 universe.
 Call
 it
 God.
 Whatever
 you


want
 to
 call
 it.
 And
 we
 were
 made
 to


create.
 And
 when
 we
 create,
 we're
 alive.


When
 we
 just
 try
 to
 maintain
 or
 manage


or
 hold
 on
 to
 something,
 if
 we're
 just


caught
 up
 in
 making
 a
 living
 instead
 of


designing
 a
 life,
 life
 is
 a
 [ __ ]
 And


that's
 why
 so
 many
 people
 have
 so
 many


challenges.
 So,
 I'm
 teaching
 my
 kids
 to


be
 creators
 and
 I
 teach
 them
 the
 second


piece,
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 I


believe
 that's
 made
 me
 successful.
 And


anyone
 I've
 ever
 interviewed,
 you


interviewed
 a
 million
 people.
 You
 see
 if


you
 agree
 or
 disagree
 with
 me.
 The
 three


most
 important
 skills
 in
 life
 now
 are


the
 ones
 that
 allow
 you
 to
 learn
 more


rapidly.
 If
 you
 learn
 rapidly,
 you
 can


win
 no
 matter
 what
 happens
 with
 the


technology.
 And
 what
 are
 those
 three


skills?
 Number
 one,
 the
 skill
 of
 pattern


recognition.


When
 you
 can
 recognize
 patterns,
 you


eliminate
 fear.
 Fear
 comes
 from
 this
 has


never
 happened
 before.
 I
 don't know
 what


this
 is.
 Chaos.
 Like
 I
 hear
 people
 all


the
 time
 talk
 about
 how
 we've
 never
 been


this
 place
 politically
 where
 here
 in


America
 where
 the
 most
 we're
 going
 to


have
 a
 civil
 war.
 The
 And
 they
 don't
 do


any
 history
 whatsoever.
 I
 I
 have
 these


two
 placards
 that
 I
 have
 because
 back


then
 they
 didn't
 have
 ads,
 right?
 They


had
 placards
 and
 one
 is
 from
 Thomas


Jefferson
 talking
 about
 Adams
 and
 one
 of


Adams
 about
 Jefferson
 and
 they
 said


stuff
 that
 make
 Republicans
 and


Democrats
 look
 like
 they're
 nice
 to
 each


other.
 I
 mean
 it's
 just
 unbelievable
 the


stuff
 they
 said.
 This
 is
 a
 cycle.
 And
 so


when
 you
 recognize
 a
 pattern
 it
 gives


you
 power,
 potential
 power
 at least.
 The


first
 power
 is
 you're
 not
 not
 afraid


anymore.
 You
 go
 now
 this
 is
 not


something
 that's
 never
 happened.
 This
 is


not
 something
 that's
 going
 to
 I I
 can


see
 this.
 I
 can
 see
 how
 this
 has
 been


dealt
 with.
 What
 took
 us
 from
 living
 in


fear,
 from
 being
 hunter
 gatherers
 or


trying
 to
 survive
 every
 day,
 didn't
 know


if
 we're
 going to
 survive
 every
 day
 to


being
 able
 to
 stay
 in
 one
 place?


What
 pattern
 recognition?


>> I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 the
 seasons,
 but


>> you
 got
 it.


>> Really?


>> That's
 it.
 The
 seasons.
 I
 figured
 you


got
 the
 seasons.
 Because
 before
 that,


you
 could
 do
 the
 right
 thing
 at
 the


wrong
 time
 and
 you
 get
 pain.
 And
 three


of
 the
 four
 seasons
 are
 the
 wrong
 time.


So
 once
 we
 figured
 out,
 oh
 my
 god,
 if
 I


plant
 in
 the
 spring
 and
 I
 take
 care


through
 the
 hot
 summer,
 I
 get
 this
 big


reaping
 and
 if
 I
 hang
 on
 to
 some
 of
 it


to
 make
 it
 through
 the
 winter,
 I
 can


live
 here.
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 worry.
 All
 my


fear
 disappears.
 So
 we
 have
 the
 minute


we
 understood
 seasons,
 it
 changed


humanity.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 there's
 the


seasons
 to
 your
 life.
 You
 could
 say
 0
 to


21
 is
 springtime.
 Springtime.
 How
 hard


is
 it
 for
 something
 to
 grow
 in


springtime?
 If
 you
 start
 a
 business
 in


an
 economic
 spring
 where
 everybody's


optimistic,
 you
 think
 you're
 a
 genius,


you're
 just
 in
 the
 right
 season,
 right?


>> So
 0
 to
 21,
 you're
 taken
 care
 of.
 And


that
 season,
 you
 grow
 like
 crazy.


Somewhere
 around
 in
 roughly,
 and


everyone's
 different,
 21,
 22
 years
 old,


you
 go
 the
 next
 stage,
 22
 to
 42,
 and


that's
 your
 summertime.
 That's
 the


testing
 period
 of
 your
 life.
 What


happens?
 You
 are
 21,
 you've
 heard
 all


this
 stuff,
 and
 now
 you
 go,
 you
 know


what?
 I
 don't
 know if
 I
 believe
 this


[ __ ]
 I
 want
 to
 see
 what
 I
 believe.


But
 I'm
 going
 to
 test
 all
 history,
 all


studies
 of
 psychology
 show
 this
 is
 the


most
 difficult
 time
 in
 most
 people's


lives,
 right?
 22
 to
 42.
 So
 if
 you're
 in


that
 range
 and
 you're
 listening,
 I
 love


you.
 Hang
 in
 there.
 You
 know,
 this
 is


this
 is
 your
 ground.
 If
 you
 keep


growing,
 this
 is
 a
 great
 time.
 All


right?
 Somewhere
 in
 that
 range,
 you
 make


a
 transition.
 Somewhere
 around
 30,
 35,


you're
 33,
 you
 just
 got
 engaged.


Congratulations.
 Right?
 You
 start
 to


move
 towards
 a
 family.
 You
 start
 to
 have


those
 experiences.
 I'm
 sure
 yours
 will


be
 very
 successful.
 many
 aren't.
 Right?


So
 at
 42
 43
 to
 63,
 that's
 the
 fall.
 If


you
 planted
 in
 the
 spring,
 right,
 and


you
 worked
 your
 tail
 off
 during
 that
 hot


summer,
 now
 you
 can
 do
 more
 with
 your


pinky
 than
 working
 around
 the
 clock.
 You


know
 more
 people,
 you
 have


relationships.
 You
 recognize
 the


patterns.
 You
 know
 what's
 going
 on.
 It's


nothing's
 really
 a
 shock
 or
 surprise
 to


you.
 You're
 more
 strategic.
 You're
 more


efficient
 or
 more
 elegant.
 You
 have
 more


choices.
 um
 you've
 learned
 a
 lot
 of


lessons
 if
 you
 grew.
 Now,
 if
 you
 didn't


plant
 in
 the
 spring
 and
 work
 hard
 in
 the


in
 the
 summer,
 you're
 going to
 weep
 in


the
 fall,
 not
 reap
 in
 the
 fall,
 right?


But
 so
 now
 this
 is
 this
 is
 your
 power


period.
 This
 is
 when
 most
 people
 earn


the
 most
 money
 in
 their
 life
 if
 they're


going
 to
 grow
 because
 they've


accumulated
 knowledge,
 skills,


relationships,
 and
 so
 forth.
 And
 then


the
 winter
 is
 comes
 back
 to
 that
 64
 to


84
 to
 104
 to
 the
 oldest
 humans
 124.
 That


period
 is
 a
 transition
 period
 to
 where


you
 become
 a
 real
 leader
 because
 you're


no
 longer,
 you
 know,
 in
 that
 22
 to
 42,


you're
 trying
 to
 prove
 yourself
 to


yourself
 or
 maybe
 other
 people
 or
 both.


But
 there's
 a
 point
 when
 you
 get
 into


your
 power
 group.
 You
 know
 who
 you
 are


by
 the
 time
 you
 get
 into
 this
 last


season,
 this,
 you
 know,
 64
 to
 84,
 104,


124,
 you
 know
 who
 the
 f
 you
 are.
 I
 mean,


and
 and
 you
 you
 want
 people
 to
 like
 what


you
 do,
 but
 if
 they
 don't,
 it's
 like,


you
 know
 who
 you
 are.
 You
 don't
 give
 a


[ __ ]
 I've
 just
 entered
 that
 season


myself.
 I'm
 about
 to
 be
 66
 in
 a
 few


weeks
 and
 um
 it's
 the
 most
 fulfilling


season
 of
 all.
 Um
 it's
 mindbgggling.
 I


wouldn't
 believe
 that
 when
 I
 was
 your


age.
 That's
 why
 I'm
 sharing
 it.
 It's
 if


you're
 healthy,
 if
 you're
 fit,
 if
 you're


strong.
 Um
 if
 you
 don't
 do
 that,
 then


it's
 can
 be
 a
 [ __ ]
 that
 time.
 But
 if


you're
 healthy
 and
 strong,
 you
 have
 40


year
 relationships,
 35
 year
 business


relationships.
 You
 have
 friends
 that


adore
 you
 and
 love
 them
 and
 you're
 it's


unbreakable.
 It's
 unshakable.
 you
 have


an
 intimate
 relationship
 or
 a
 family
 or


husband
 and
 wife
 relationship
 if
 you've


built
 to
 that
 point
 that
 is
 beyond


anything
 you
 could
 have
 dreamed
 of
 or


hoped
 for.
 You
 wake
 up
 every
 day
 and
 you


know
 that
 life
 is
 a
 gift
 and
 you
 want
 to


give
 back
 even
 more.
 Like
 you're
 more


driven
 than
 you
 were
 when
 you
 were
 in


the
 22
 to
 42
 stage.
 Those
 are
 the


seasons.
 There's
 one
 more.
 Your
 seasons


of
 history
 and
 your
 season
 of
 history


shapes
 how
 you
 shape
 your
 life.
 So
 you


can
 look
 at
 a
 thousand
 years
 of
 Roman


history.
 I'm
 very
 much
 in
 history
 and


500
 years
 of
 Anglo-American
 history.
 Um,


and
 you
 start
 to
 see
 patterns.
 In
 fact,


I'd
 recommend
 for
 everyone
 there's
 a


book
 called
 Generations.
 Have
 you
 read


it?


>> No.


>> When
 I
 was
 working
 with
 President
 uh


Clinton


in
 those
 days,
 I
 worked
 with
 President


Clinton.
 I
 went
 across
 the
 other
 side


and
 worked
 with
 the
 speaker
 of
 the
 house


Gingrich.
 I
 on
 the
 same
 day
 on
 Clinton's


on
 on
 his
 desk
 on
 the
 resolute
 desk
 was


this
 book
 generations.
 And
 I
 asked
 him


about
 it
 and
 he
 told
 me
 about
 how
 it


it's
 amazing.
 It
 shows
 how
 history
 is


somewhat
 predictable
 and
 why
 the
 cycles


are
 generated
 by
 different
 generations,


how
 we
 react
 the
 way
 we're
 we
 grew
 up.


And
 then
 I
 go
 over
 to
 Gingrich's
 office


and
 he's
 a
 historian.
 He's
 got
 it
 on
 his


desk.


>> It's
 a
 pretty
 thick
 book,
 good
 size


book.
 My
 point
 is
 it
 if
 you
 want
 to


navigate
 your
 life,
 you
 need
 pattern


recognition
 so
 you
 don't
 go
 in
 reaction.


And
 one
 thing
 is
 to
 understand
 seasons


are
 a
 great
 pattern.
 They
 freed
 us.


There
 are
 seasons
 of
 your
 life.
 You


should
 think
 about
 this
 season.
 What's


this
 season
 about
 for
 you?
 What
 do
 you


want
 to
 extract
 from
 this
 season?
 And


every
 season
 has
 predictable
 challenges


and
 predictable
 opportunities.
 And
 where


am
 I
 in
 the
 season?
 Some
 people
 go


through
 their
 springtime
 during
 a
 war,
 a


winter
 time.
 Some
 people
 go
 through


their
 springtime
 in
 a
 fall.
 We
 all
 grew


up
 with
 different
 environments.
 And
 so


we're
 shaped
 by
 that.
 And
 that's
 why


history's
 changed.
 So,
 but
 let
 me
 finish


the
 last
 last
 piece.
 I've
 gone
 way
 long.


I
 apologize.
 But
 I
 said
 there's
 three


skills.
 What What
 do
 we
 need,
 right?


First
 one
 is
 pattern
 recognition.
 The


second
 one
 is
 pattern
 utilization.


So
 I
 watch
 you
 like
 you,
 you
 and
 I
 both,


we
 develop
 companies,
 took
 them
 public


very
 early
 ages,
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 and


figured
 out
 it
 wasn't
 just
 about
 money,


right?
 You
 know,
 looking
 at
 your


history.
 You
 didn't
 just
 recognize


patterns,
 you
 used
 them.
 You
 saw
 them
 in


marketing
 areas.
 You
 saw
 online


opportunities.
 You
 saw
 things.
 You


didn't
 just,
 oh,
 now
 I
 understand
 it.


You
 jumped
 on
 it.
 Anyone
 who's


incredibly
 successful
 in
 anything,
 if


they're
 great
 at
 dance,
 if
 they're
 great


at
 investing
 in
 companies,
 they're
 great


in
 running
 companies,
 if
 they're
 great


in
 singing,
 they
 recognize
 there
 are


certain
 patterns.
 And
 then
 the
 final


skill,
 and
 this
 is
 what
 I'm
 teaching
 my


children,
 is
 you
 ultimately
 want
 to


become
 a
 pattern
 creator.
 Take
 an


example.
 Same
 learn
 to
 play
 the
 piano,


right?
 Yeah.
 How
 do
 you
 learn
 to
 play


the
 piano?
 You
 got
 to
 recognize


patterns.
 And
 usually
 you're
 taught


someone
 else's
 patterns
 that
 produce


something
 beautiful,


>> right?
 could
 be
 Bach
 Beethoven,
 it
 could


be
 some
 rock,
 it
 could
 be
 whatever


you're
 learning.
 And
 so
 you
 learn
 those


patterns
 and
 you
 practice
 them.
 You


learn
 to
 use
 them,
 right?
 And
 now
 you


can
 produce
 the
 same
 music.
 There
 is
 a


point
 and
 I'm
 sure
 you've
 experienced


this
 already
 and
 you're
 going to


experience
 a
 lot
 more
 in
 the
 next
 10


years
 of
 your
 life.
 You've
 taken
 so
 much


input
 in,
 you've
 recognized
 so
 many


patterns
 that
 now
 you
 come
 through
 and


you
 become
 the
 pattern
 creator.
 And


that's
 when
 you
 start
 to
 become
 the
 goat


of
 your
 industry,
 the
 best
 of
 all
 time.


You
 look
 at,
 you
 know,
 Tom
 Brady's
 a


friend
 of
 mine.
 Like
 he
 made
 pattern


distinctions
 no
 one
 else
 made
 on
 how
 to


keep
 his
 body
 strong,
 one
 of
 the
 most


important
 ones.
 So
 he
 had
 the
 duration,


but
 also
 how
 to
 read
 the
 defense,
 know


what's
 happening.
 Those
 tools,
 he


started
 create
 his
 own
 patterns
 about


how
 to
 deal
 with
 that,
 right?
 And
 so


once
 you
 create
 your
 own
 patterns,
 you


bring
 something
 to
 the
 table
 that's


never
 been
 there
 before.
 And
 when
 you


make
 something
 never
 been
 there
 before,


your
 value
 goes
 through
 the
 roof.
 When
 I


met
 Jim
 Ran,
 my
 original
 personal


development
 teacher,
 he
 changed
 my
 life


radically.
 I
 went
 when
 I
 was
 17
 years


old.
 He
 Oh,
 yeah.
 That's
 great
 picture.


That's
 great.


I
 love
 that
 man.
 Beautiful
 man.
 I
 I
 went


What
 I
 did
 was
 I
 was
 working
 as
 a


janitor.
 I'm
 in
 high
 school,
 sophomore


year,
 and
 I
 had
 um
 my
 mom
 came
 home
 one


day
 and
 said,
 "Uh,
 we've
 got
 a
 friend


that
 needs
 somebody
 to
 help
 move
 stuff."


And
 I
 was
 always
 trying
 to
 earn
 some


extra
 money.
 And
 so,
 and
 it
 was
 the


weekends
 and
 I
 wasn't
 doing
 the


janitorial
 work
 on
 the
 weekends.
 So,
 I


said,
 "Okay,
 I'll
 I'll
 I'll
 do
 it.


Volunteer."
 And
 my
 dad
 said,
 "Yeah,
 you


got
 to
 find
 out
 what
 he
 did.
 He
 used
 to


be
 such
 a
 loser.
 Now
 he's
 so
 successful,


right?"
 And
 so,
 when
 I
 went
 to
 go
 see


this
 guy,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 a
 hard
 worker,


so
 I
 worked
 really
 hard.
 And
 so,
 he
 took


me
 to
 lunch
 and
 he
 starts
 asking
 me


questions.
 I
 said, "I
 want
 to
 ask
 you


questions."
 And
 I
 said,
 "You
 know,
 my


father
 said,
 "You
 used
 to
 be
 such
 a


loser
 and
 now
 you're
 so
 successful.


How'd
 you
 change
 your
 life?
 I'm
 just
 a


kid."
 I
 wasn't
 trying
 to
 be
 funny
 or


mean,
 right?
 The
 guy
 you
 said
 your
 dad


said,
 "What?"
 He
 goes,
 "Well,
 it's


true."
 And
 he
 said,
 'Well,
 what
 changed


my
 life
 is
 I
 went
 to
 a
 seminar.
 He
 goes,


"Yeah,
 I
 was,
 you
 know,
 three
 and
 a
 half


hours.
 His
 name
 is
 Jim
 Ran."
 He
 told
 me


the
 whole
 thing.
 And
 he's
 here
 in
 Orange


County.
 He's
 coming
 up
 to
 an
 event


pretty
 quick.
 I
 said, 'Could
 you
 get
 me


in?
 And
 he
 goes,
 "Yeah."
 I
 said,
 "Well,


how
 much
 is
 it?"
 He
 said,
 "
 $35?
 It'
 be


like
 $250
 in
 today's
 money,
 right?"
 And


I
 said,
 "
 $35?
 I'm
 making
 $40
 a
 week
 as


a
 janitor,
 right?"
 He
 go
 I
 said,
 "I
 I I


can't
 do
 that."
 He
 goes,
 "Well,
 then


just
 learn
 on
 your
 own
 experience
 and


waste
 a
 few
 decades."
 I
 said,
 'You


really
 think
 it's
 that
 valuable?'
 He


goes,
 "No,
 you
 have
 to
 decide
 if
 it's


that
 valuable."
 And
 so
 I
 remember
 I
 I


wrestled
 with
 this
 like
 it
 was
 the


biggest
 decision
 of
 my
 life,
 a
 week's


pay.
 And
 and
 I
 went
 in
 and
 I
 heard
 this


man
 speak.
 He
 said
 some
 simple
 things


like,
 you
 know,
 for
 things
 to
 change,


you
 got
 to
 change.
 For
 things
 to
 get


better,
 you
 got
 to
 get
 better,
 right?


Interesting
 things.
 But
 at
 the
 end,
 I


was
 so
 excited.
 I
 went
 up
 to
 him
 and
 I


said,
 I
 want
 to
 come
 work
 for
 you.
 I


want
 to
 learn
 this.
 I
 want
 to
 be
 a
 part


of
 this.
 And
 he
 turned
 to
 me
 and
 said,


"Look,
 kid."
 He
 goes,
 "Uh,
 um,
 you
 know,


if
 you
 want
 to
 come
 work
 for
 me,
 you
 got


to
 go
 through
 all
 my
 programs."
 And
 I


said, "What
 does
 that
 mean?"
 And
 he


said, "Well,
 you
 got
 to
 this,
 this,


this."
 You
 know,
 it
 was
 like
 $1,200
 for


just
 one
 of the
 programs
 for
 a
 weekend.


$1,200
 is
 like
 $10,000
 today
 to
 give
 an


idea.
 $12,000.
 I'm
 at
 the
 time
 sleeping


in
 my
 car,
 working
 as
 a
 janitor.
 My
 dad


left,
 my
 mom
 kicked
 him
 out.
 Mom's
 a


strong
 woman.
 And
 then
 she
 chased
 me
 out


with
 a
 knife.
 She
 wasn't
 going
 to
 kill


me,
 but
 I
 wasn't
 going
 back
 in
 that


place.
 And
 so
 I'm
 like,
 I
 I
 can't
 I


can't
 do
 this.
 And
 then
 said
 something,


he
 said,
 you
 know,
 decide.
 He
 goes,
 some


people
 have
 to
 survive,
 some
 people


succeed,
 decide
 which
 one
 you
 are,
 and


if
 you're
 ready
 by
 next
 Saturday,
 a
 week


from
 Saturday,
 he
 goes,
 um,
 I'm
 starting


a
 training
 and
 you
 can
 join
 it,
 but
 if


you
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 the
 money
 for
 it,


you
 won't
 be able
 to
 do
 it.
 And
 I


remember
 leaving
 thinking,
 this
 guy
 just


wants
 my
 money.
 He's
 such
 a
 jerk.
 And
 I


was
 so
 angry.
 But
 then
 in
 my
 head,
 I
 was


like,
 he's
 right.
 He's
 right.
 You
 know,


I've
 always
 gotten
 what
 I
 had
 to
 have.
 I


haven't
 had
 to
 have
 much.
 And
 so
 I


started
 going
 to
 banks.
 I
 walked
 in
 this


place,
 five
 banks
 turned
 down
 and
 I
 saw


this
 woman
 who
 looked
 persuadable
 and


sweet.
 And
 her
 name
 was
 uh
 Mrs.


Williams.
 This
 woman
 looks
 at
 me
 and
 she


goes,
 "The
 bank's
 not
 going
 to
 loan
 you


this
 money."
 And
 I'm
 she's
 like
 my
 fifth


bank.
 And
 uh
 I
 said,
 "You
 don't


understand."
 And
 I
 got
 all
 passionate.


She
 goes,
 "With
 this
 kind
 of
 focus
 and


energy,
 I
 think
 you
 can
 do
 something.


I'd
 like
 it
 to
 be
 something
 good."
 And


she
 goes,
 "Um,


I
 want
 to
 talk
 to
 the
 bank,
 but
 if
 the


bank
 will
 ling
 the
 money,
 I
 will.
 if
 you


look
 me
 in
 the
 eye
 and
 you
 swear
 to
 me


I'm
 never
 going
 to
 have
 to
 come
 find
 you


and
 you
 will
 take
 care
 of
 this.
 And
 I


jumped
 across,
 hugged
 her
 and
 kissed


her.
 She
 wasn't
 quite
 ready
 for
 that.
 I


went
 to
 Jim
 Ran
 seminar.
 I
 went
 to
 work


for
 him.
 And
 the
 first
 question
 when
 I


got
 finally
 got
 a
 private
 moment
 with


him
 that
 I
 asked
 was,
 I
 had
 four


fathers.
 They
 were
 all
 good
 men.
 They


all
 worked
 hard.
 How
 come
 we
 never
 had


any
 money
 and
 sometimes
 no
 food?
 I
 said,


I
 look
 over
 at
 the
 school
 teacher
 who


makes
 $35,000
 a
 year,
 I
 think,
 in
 those


days.
 And
 then
 I
 see
 this
 hedge
 fund
 guy


who
 made
 a
 billion
 dollars
 in
 a
 year.
 I


said,
 'Th
 that
 is
 so
 unjust.'
 And
 he


gave
 me
 a
 lesson
 that
 changed
 my
 whole


life.
 He
 said,
 Tony,
 he
 said,
 'You


right.
 We're
 all
 equal
 as
 souls,


but
 we're
 not
 equal
 in
 the
 marketplace.


I
 said,
 what
 does
 that
 mean?
 He
 said,


well,
 let
 me
 ask
 you
 a
 question.
 Is
 it


possible
 someone
 to
 make
 twice
 as
 much


money
 in
 the
 same
 amount
 of
 time?
 Yeah.


Four
 times,
 10
 times,
 100
 times.
 Yeah,


people
 do
 it.
 How?
 He
 goes,
 you
 have
 to


become
 more
 valuable.
 He
 goes,
 "If
 you


go
 to
 work
 at
 McDonald's,
 you
 get
 this


tiny
 little
 income.
 It's
 not
 made
 to
 be


an
 ideal
 job.
 It's
 a
 first-time
 job.


Anyone
 can
 learn
 to
 do
 it
 in
 two
 hours."


And
 I've
 been
 obsessed
 about
 it
 ever


since.
 And
 I
 that
 changed
 everything
 in


my
 life.
 My
 whole
 life
 became
 how
 do
 I


add
 more
 value?
 And
 so
 today
 I
 have
 121


companies
 and
 we're
 doing
 12
 billion


dollars
 in
 business
 across
 almost
 every


industry
 you
 can
 imagine
 that
 I'm
 a
 part


of.
 And
 I
 couldn't
 run
 one
 company
 in


the
 start
 and
 you
 know
 and
 make
 it


successful
 at
 300,000
 a
 year
 you
 know


for
 the
 revenue
 all
 that
 became
 in
 every


industry
 and
 I'm
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 I'm
 the


number
 one
 in
 the
 industry
 it's
 because


I'm
 obsessed
 with
 adding
 value
 and
 so
 I


think
 that
 piece
 is
 what's
 missing
 also


from
 our
 youth
 you're
 saying
 what
 do


they
 need
 to
 do
 they
 think
 I'm
 here
 to


get
 something
 no
 life
 is
 calling
 you


what
 are
 you
 going
 to
 give
 not
 not
 just


what
 you
 want
 to
 give
 but
 what
 people


need
 and
 so
 my
 focus
 is
 I
 give
 people


what
 they
 want.
 They
 want
 to
 make
 more


money.
 They
 want
 a
 better
 relationship.


But
 my
 goal
 is
 so
 I
 can
 give
 them
 what


they
 need,
 which
 is
 a
 life
 that
 has
 more


meaning.
 And
 that's
 one
 that
 goes
 beyond


yourself.


>> It's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 stressful
 period.


>> Yes.


>> To
 say
 the
 least.


>> Um
 I
 I
 think
 algorithms
 are
 actually


making
 our
 online
 experiences
 more


stressful.
 I
 think


>> 100%.


>> Because
 you
 know,
 they're
 designed
 to


retain
 our
 attention.
 And
 the
 best
 way


to
 retain
 our
 attention
 is
 probably


fear.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 this
 with
 myself,
 I


find
 myself
 watching
 all
 these
 [ __ ]


short
 form
 videos
 that
 are
 just
 like


they
 feel
 like
 they're
 at
 some
 level


frying
 something,
 depleting
 something
 in


me,
 but
 they're
 they're
 design
 it's


designed
 the
 algorithms
 to
 serve
 me
 up


the
 next
 one
 that's
 going
 to
 hold
 me
 or


scare
 me
 or
 whatever.


>> So
 in
 such
 a
 world
 where
 we're
 the


algorithms
 are
 probably
 going
 to,
 you


know,
 in
 the
 online
 world,
 especially


for
 younger
 kids,
 is
 going
 to
 really


>> it's
 going
 to
 is
 going
 to
 be
 better
 at


taking
 hold
 of
 us.
 What
 are
 the
 tools


that
 I
 need
 to
 deal
 with
 this
 stress
 and


this
 angst?


>> The
 first
 step
 to
 me
 would
 be
 take
 15


minutes
 out
 of
 your
 day
 and
 go
 for


microlearning.
 Like
 decide
 you're
 going


to
 learn
 what
 matters,
 right?
 About


yourself,
 about
 AI.
 We
 tell
 people
 like


you
 already
 have
 habits,
 right?
 Most


people
 are
 scrolling
 a
 good
 portion
 of


the
 day.
 Give
 me
 15
 of
 those
 minutes
 and


let's
 do
 microlearning
 on
 something,
 a


new
 language
 to
 stimulate
 your
 brain,


philosophy,
 history,
 AI,
 something


pragmatic,
 something
 that's
 valuable.


It's
 just
 getting
 people
 to
 have
 some


habits
 that
 you
 know
 the
 1%
 growth


metaphor
 right
 you
 know
 you
 know
 27


times
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 it's
 like


it's
 pretty
 simple
 all
 we
 have
 to
 do
 is


create
 a
 new
 direction
 if
 you
 try
 to
 do


it
 one
 giant
 step
 it's
 overwhelming
 for


people
 that
 the
 secret
 to
 life
 is


chunking
 think
 of
 it
 this
 way
 some


people
 never
 work
 out
 but
 they
 eat


easily
 so
 I'll
 say
 to
 them
 why
 don't
 you


work
 out
 and
 they'll
 give
 me
 all
 the


reasons
 and
 I'll
 say
 but
 you
 know
 you


know
 I'd
 have
 to
 I'd
 have
 to
 join
 a
 gym


and
 I
 said
 okay
 well
 tell
 me
 what's


entailed
 and
 they'll
 go
 I
 got
 to
 look
 up


where
 the
 gyms
 are
 and
 then
 I
 got
 to
 I


got
 to
 drive
 to
 each
 of
 the
 gyms
 and


then
 I
 got
 to
 you
 know
 I
 got
 to
 park
 the


car
 each
 place
 and
 find
 it
 and
 then
 I


got
 to
 get
 out
 and
 then
 you
 know
 get


hopefully
 get
 a
 pass
 and
 then
 they
 take


you
 on
 the
 tour
 and
 and
 then
 they
 will


sit
 you
 down
 and
 sell
 stuff
 to
 you
 and


they
 got
 to
 back
 in
 the
 car
 and
 you
 got


to
 drive
 things
 and
 then
 when
 you
 go
 do


it
 let's
 say
 you
 sign
 up
 then
 you
 go
 and


you
 got
 to
 check
 check
 in
 and
 take
 off


all
 your
 clothes
 and
 then
 they
 drop
 and


get
 wrinkled
 and
 then
 you
 go
 work
 out


and
 it's
 sweaty
 you
 got
 to
 wipe
 other


people's
 sweat
 off
 and
 then
 afterwards


you
 got
 to
 go
 do
 a
 shower
 and
 your
 hair


is
 messed
 up
 and
 your
 makeup
 you
 got


start
 all
 over
 and
 everything
 else
 and


you
 got
 to
 get
 the
 thing
 and
 you
 got
 to


back
 out.
 It's
 like
 it's
 too
 much
 work.


What
 does
 it
 take
 to
 eat?
 Well,
 you
 just


go.
 They
 chunk
 eating
 is
 one
 thing.
 They


chunk
 working
 out
 as
 29,000
 things,


right?
 So,
 if
 you
 chunk
 too
 big,
 try
 to


do
 everything
 in
 one
 bite.
 It's


overwhelming.
 And
 if
 you
 chunk
 it
 too


small,
 it's
 overwhelming.
 So,
 there's
 a


different
 size
 for
 different
 things.
 And


if
 we
 want
 to
 learn
 and
 grow,
 which
 is


what
 the
 secret
 is
 to
 your
 future
 is
 to


become
 a
 learning
 machine
 about
 what


matters.
 Like
 most
 people
 major
 in
 minor


things,
 they
 know
 more
 about
 some


actresses
 or
 actors
 love
 life
 um
 than


they
 do
 or
 their
 skin
 regimen
 than
 they


do
 about
 their
 own
 values
 and
 needs
 and


what
 makes
 them
 tick
 as
 a
 human
 being.


Today
 you
 can
 learn
 from
 the
 brightest,


smartest
 people
 on
 earth.
 They're


available.
 They're
 available
 by
 online.


They're
 available
 by
 by
 contracting
 or


coaching
 them.
 They're
 they're


everywhere.
 There
 isn't
 a
 limit
 anymore.


There's
 zero
 limit
 except
 you're


deciding
 to
 be
 a
 creator
 and
 not
 a


maintainer.
 He
 said
 you're
 deciding
 I'm


not
 just
 going
 to
 manage
 my
 life.
 I'm


going
 to
 design
 and
 create
 something
 cuz


the
 tools
 are
 available
 everywhere.
 And


so
 I'm
 just
 one
 of
 those.


>> I
 have a
 couple
 of
 questions
 based
 on


what
 you've
 just
 said.
 The
 first
 one


starting
 at
 the
 top
 was
 around
 you


talked
 about
 this
 idea
 of
 pattern


recognition
 uh
 utilization
 and
 creation.


The
 question
 I
 had
 from
 that
 section
 was


is
 there
 a
 way
 to
 get
 better
 at
 pattern


recognition?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 first
 by
 understanding
 it's


the
 most
 important
 key.


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 So,
 it's
 like
 if
 I'm


fearful,
 what's
 the
 pattern
 I'm
 missing


here?
 What's
 something
 that
 could
 give


me
 some
 history
 to
 understand
 that
 this


isn't
 random?
 Like,
 you
 know,
 people


say,
 "I
 overeat.
 I
 overdrink.
 I
 I
 get


really
 angry
 at
 every
 you
 don't
 overread


every
 moment.
 You
 don't
 smoke
 every


moment."
 What
 are
 the
 triggers
 that
 you


use


>> and
 do
 you
 do
 you
 recommend
 people


write?
 How
 do
 they
 how
 do
 they
 raise


their
 self-awareness
 enough
 to
 start


spotting
 these
 patterns?


>> I
 believe
 in
 diaries.
 You
 call
 it
 diary.


I
 call
 it
 journals.
 I
 believe
 in


journalism
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that
 to


guide
 yourself.
 But
 yes,
 but
 it's
 more


than
 that.
 You
 have
 to
 you
 have
 to
 not


only
 make
 the
 distinction,
 but
 you
 also


have
 to
 have
 a
 different
 state
 to
 it.


For
 example,
 let's
 say
 um
 let's
 say
 uh
 I


say
 to
 you,
 I
 know
 I
 know
 um
 I
 need
 to


lose
 weight.
 Um
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 it.
 I'm


going
 to
 go
 on
 a
 diet.
 Um
 I'm
 going
 to


work
 out.
 Am
 I
 going
 to
 do
 it?


>> No.
 Because
 I'm
 not
 in
 the
 state
 to
 do


it.
 Now,
 most
 people
 are
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 what
 to
 do.
 And
 there's


nothing
 wrong
 with
 that.
 But
 it's
 the


wrong
 sequence
 because
 when
 you
 think


about
 what
 to
 do,
 if
 you've
 never
 done


it
 before,
 you
 feel
 uncertain,
 you
 don't


follow
 through.
 If
 you
 have
 done
 it


before,
 but
 you
 don't
 feel
 strong


enough,
 you're
 not
 going to
 follow


through.
 So,
 I
 tell
 people,
 if
 you
 want


a
 breakthrough,
 it's
 three
 things.


Strategy,
 story,
 state.
 Most
 people,
 if


they
 want
 to
 have
 a
 breakthrough,
 they


want
 to
 change
 their
 body,
 you
 want
 to


change
 their
 life,
 they
 look
 for
 how
 to


do
 it.
 And
 that's
 natural,
 but
 it's
 the


absolute
 wrong
 order.
 And
 if
 you
 do


things
 in
 the
 wrong
 order,
 it's
 like


having
 the
 numbers
 to
 a
 phone
 for


someone
 and
 you
 dial
 the
 wrong
 order,


you
 don't
 reach
 somebody.
 Or
 the
 vault,


right?
 You
 got
 the
 right
 numbers
 the


wrong
 order,
 vault
 doesn't
 open.
 Why
 are


so
 many
 people
 overweight
 in
 this


country?
 Like
 60%
 of
 the
 population
 is


overweight.
 How
 is
 that
 possible?
 Is
 it


because
 what
 it
 takes
 to
 be
 fit
 and


strong
 is
 so
 incredibly
 complex?
 No.


Only
 the
 1%
 knows.
 No.
 It's
 super


expensive.
 No,
 you
 have
 to
 work
 not
 to


know
 what
 to
 do.
 So
 that
 the
 how
 is
 not


the
 problem.
 So
 I
 say
 strategy
 story


state
 that's
 how
 you
 have
 a


breakthrough.
 Yes,
 I'm
 a
 strategist.
 The


right
 strategy
 can
 save
 you
 10
 years.
 I


love
 that.
 It's
 fun.
 But
 if
 I
 start
 with


a
 strategy,
 you'll
 listen
 and
 go,
 "Yeah,


that's
 cool."
 And
 you
 won't
 do
 it.
 The


real
 problem
 is
 the
 story
 you
 have.
 The


story
 you
 have
 is
 I've
 tried
 everything.


>> The
 story
 you
 have,
 nothing
 works.
 The


story
 has
 all
 the
 good
 ones
 are
 gone
 and


I'm
 gay
 and
 they're
 not
 or
 they're
 gay


and
 I'm
 not.
 It's
 the
 story
 is
 the


belief
 you've
 told
 yourself
 over
 and


over
 because
 belief
 is
 the
 invisible


force
 that
 controls
 everything
 in
 your


life.
 And
 when
 you
 have
 a
 belief
 that


you've
 honed
 because
 you're
 fearful
 and


you've
 never
 done
 this
 before,
 then
 I


can
 show
 you
 exactly
 how
 to
 do
 it
 and


you'll
 say,
 "It
 doesn't
 work.
 I've
 tried


that."
 Yeah.
 How
 many
 times?
 How
 hard?


How
 many
 minutes?
 Right?
 But
 what's


behind
 the
 story
 is
 your
 state.
 Your


mental
 emotional
 state.
 If
 I
 said
 to


you,
 I
 am
 going
 to
 lose
 12
 pounds
 in
 the


next
 6
 weeks.
 There
 is
 non-negotiable.


Here's
 why
 I
 do
 this
 and
 this
 and
 this


and
 this.
 Do
 you
 think
 I'm
 going
 to
 do


it?


>> Yes.


>> You
 bet
 your
 ass
 I'm
 going to
 do
 it.


Right.
 You
 can
 feel
 the
 state.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 people
 are
 usually
 trying
 to
 figure


out
 how
 to
 do
 something
 and
 they
 got
 a


story
 about
 it
 when
 what
 they
 need
 first


is
 the
 state.
 When
 you
 go
 in
 the
 right


state,
 have
 you
 had
 this
 happen
 where


you
 get
 in
 a
 flow
 and
 and
 something


comes
 through?
 You're
 hitting
 a
 tennis


ball
 or
 you're
 doing
 or
 you're
 speaking


and
 at
 the
 end
 of
 you're
 like,
 "That
 was


pretty
 awesome.
 I
 did
 that.
 How'd
 I
 do?


I
 don't
 know.
 That
 [ __ ]
 just
 flowed.


That
 was
 pretty
 awesome,
 right?
 You're


in
 a
 peak
 state.
 I
 put
 people
 in
 a
 peak


state
 while
 they're
 doing
 the
 things


we're
 talking
 about.


>> So,
 what
 do
 you
 do
 right
 before
 you
 come


out
 on
 stage?
 And
 what
 can
 anyone


listening
 at
 home
 do
 before
 the
 big


meeting,
 the
 big
 moment
 in
 their
 life
 or


really
 like
 on
 a
 daily
 basis
 to


configure
 our
 state?


>> The
 first
 thing
 I
 do,
 my
 little
 daily


routine
 is
 I
 go
 out,
 I
 use
 the
 jacuzzi


for
 a
 moment
 to
 open
 my
 body
 up
 and


everything
 else
 and
 then
 I
 go
 on
 the


cold
 plunge.
 And
 I've
 been
 doing
 that


for
 18
 years
 now.
 Everybody
 talks
 about


it,
 but
 I
 go
 into
 that
 cold
 plunge.
 And


the
 secret
 though
 is
 I
 don't
 negotiate


with
 myself.
 I
 go
 on
 the
 cold
 plunge
 for


both
 the
 health
 purposes
 because
 it


floods
 your
 body,
 right?
 Completely.
 But


the
 the
 real
 value
 is
 is
 the
 mental


discipline
 of
 I
 don't
 go,
 okay,
 I'm


ready.
 And
 I
 don't
 get
 in
 one
 just
 lie


lying
 here.
 I
 dunk
 under.
 I
 jump
 in.
 Not


one
 that
 goes
 above
 my
 head.
 I
 go
 under


under
 the
 water.
 I
 dive
 into
 it.
 Right?


And
 I
 don't
 stand
 there.
 I
 don't
 stand


there
 and
 go,
 "Oh,
 I
 feel
 cold
 right


now."
 or
 another
 minute
 or
 like
 I've


trained
 my
 brain
 when
 I
 say
 go,
 we
 go.


And
 I've
 done
 that
 for
 decades.
 And
 so


I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 in
 the
 place
 when
 I
 say


go
 somewhere
 else,
 my
 brain
 obeys.
 I'm


not
 I
 don't
 have
 these
 stories
 in
 my


head
 back
 and
 forth
 trying
 to
 have
 a


conversation
 with
 myself,
 trying
 to


convince
 myself
 to
 do
 something
 I've


decided,
 right?
 So
 decision
 point
 is


everything.
 So
 I've
 trained
 myself
 to
 do


it,
 but
 also
 it
 produces
 a
 massive


change.
 It
 is
 not
 comfortable.
 I
 don't


think
 there's
 been
 a
 morning
 in
 my
 life


that
 I've
 looked
 forward
 to
 doing
 it,


but
 it
 changes
 you.
 So,
 that's
 one


thing.
 The
 thing
 I
 do
 before
 I
 go
 on


stage,
 I
 have
 a
 routine
 of
 how
 I
 shift


my
 body.
 I
 have
 a
 I
 have
 a
 prayer
 that
 I


do,
 which
 is
 use
 me,
 Lord,
 and
 I
 picture


being
 to
 serve
 as
 many
 human
 people
 as


human
 beings
 as
 possible.
 I
 see
 them
 not


only
 where
 they
 are
 now,
 I
 see
 where


they're
 going to
 be
 by
 the
 end
 of
 what


I'm
 done.
 And
 then
 I
 make
 this
 radical


shift
 in
 my
 body.
 I
 make
 these
 moves
 and


explosive
 breath.
 And
 then
 I
 storm
 out


there.
 And
 then
 I've
 I've
 taken
 myself


imagine
 on
 a
 zero
 to
 10
 to
 a
 20
 of


intensity.
 So
 now
 I
 can
 drop
 down
 to
 a


nine
 feels
 like
 I'm
 very
 relaxed
 and
 but


I've
 got
 a
 lot
 more
 gears
 in
 me
 than
 you


know.
 And
 that's
 how
 I
 can
 project
 to


the
 guy
 at
 the
 top
 of
 the
 stadium
 and


hold
 them
 for
 12
 hours,
 you
 know,
 who


wouldn't
 sit
 for
 a
 three-hour
 movie


someone
 spent
 $300
 million
 on.


>> And
 do
 you
 think
 a
 lot
 about
 your
 diet


and
 nutrition?


>> I'm
 Yeah,
 I'm
 totally
 committed
 to
 that.


And
 I
 also
 train
 like
 a
 crazy
 person
 and


I
 do
 hyperbaric
 oxygen.
 And
 I
 I
 you
 name


it.
 I'm
 a
 I'm
 a
 biohacker.
 Um
 and
 I'm


committed
 to
 that.
 I
 have
 a
 whole


company
 that
 does
 it
 for
 people
 as
 well.


So
 I've
 always
 done
 that
 because
 I've


had
 to
 to
 perform.
 And
 I'm
 66
 going
 to


produce
 results
 that,
 you
 know,
 were


designed
 by
 a
 25-year-old,
 right?
 But


I'm
 stronger
 today
 than
 I
 was
 then.
 I


got
 more
 aerobic
 capacity.
 I've
 got
 more


muscle
 capacity.
 So
 I
 mean,
 there's
 a


limit,
 but
 I
 haven't
 found
 it
 yet.


>> If
 you
 follow
 me,
 you've
 probably
 heard


me
 talk
 about
 hiring
 more
 so
 than


anything
 else.
 So,
 you
 probably
 see
 me


on
 Behind
 the
 Diary,
 which
 is
 our
 other


YouTube
 channel,
 talking
 about
 how


obsessed
 I
 am
 with
 the
 hiring
 process.


And
 this
 really
 brings
 me
 to
 a


recommendation
 I'd
 love
 to
 give
 you,


which
 is
 to
 check
 out
 our
 sponsor,

 you're

 In
 a
 world


of
 um
 in
 a
 world
 of
 challenging
 meaning


where
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 viewers
 are


struggling
 with
 meaning,
 one
 of the


things
 I've
 noticed
 is
 that
 it
 appears


especially
 with
 young
 men
 who
 you
 talked


about
 earlier.
 They
 it
 appears
 that
 more


and
 more
 of
 them
 are
 turning
 to
 religion


and
 you
 mentioned
 your
 your
 faith
 in
 God


there.
 It's
 a
 really
 interesting


phenomenon
 for
 me
 that
 I've
 observed
 in


my
 own
 life.
 I've
 talked
 about
 this
 a


few
 times.
 Um
 certain
 friends
 of
 mine


who
 were
 very
 individualistic.
 They
 were


living
 the
 dream
 in
 any
 way
 that
 you


might
 define
 it,
 you
 know.
 Yeah.
 They


had
 money,
 they
 had
 freedom,
 they
 had
 no


boss,
 no
 dependence,
 no
 no
 partner.
 And


suddenly
 you
 see
 their
 life
 turn
 into


what
 looks
 like
 depression,
 a
 form
 of


depression.


>> Yeah.


>> An
 absence
 of
 meaning
 in
 their
 lives.


And
 I
 I I
 I
 wanted
 just
 to
 throw
 this


out
 there
 because
 we
 we
 are
 in
 a
 society


that's
 um
 I
 think
 increasingly


encouraging
 independence.


>> Yes.


>> And
 there's
 upsides
 to
 independence,
 of


course.
 We
 all
 understand
 those.
 I


wondered
 if
 there's
 a
 sort
 of
 a


double-edged
 sword
 here
 when
 we're
 we're


you
 kind
 of
 said
 it
 earlier
 about
 making


the
 world
 more
 about
 just
 me
 me
 and
 I.


And
 in
 a
 world
 of
 abundance,
 I
 imagine


many
 more
 people
 are
 going
 to
 choose
 to


make
 it
 about
 I
 I
 I
 cuz
 they
 can
 I
 could


put
 a
 headset
 on
 theoretically
 never


leave
 my
 house.
 Someone
 could
 literally


put
 a
 robot
 puts
 the
 food
 in
 my
 mouth.
 I


could
 have
 some
 sex
 robot
 that
 just
 gets


me
 off.
 Money
 comes
 in
 my
 account
 by


UBI.
 the
 reason
 your
 friends
 got


depressed.
 I've
 had
 this
 happen.
 I've


seen
 this
 as
 well.
 I've,
 you
 know,
 most


of my
 friends
 are
 older
 than
 I
 am.


Usually,
 for
 some
 reason,
 I
 gravitated


to
 to
 men
 that
 were
 18,
 20
 years
 my


senior
 who
 were
 brilliant
 and
 learning


from
 them
 and
 seeing
 where
 they're
 going


in
 their
 life
 and
 so
 forth.
 But
 I
 watch


some
 of
 them
 like
 sell
 their
 company
 and


make
 a
 billion
 two


>> and
 then
 they
 were
 happy
 for
 like
 a


month
 maybe
 and
 they'd
 call
 me,
 let's
 go


do
 this,
 go
 do
 that.
 And,
 you
 know,
 try


to
 go
 to
 somebody.
 I
 got,
 you
 know,
 I


got
 a
 lot
 of
 companies,
 got
 a
 lot
 got
 a


lot
 of
 kids,
 I
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 things,


right?
 And
 it's
 like,
 and
 eventually


they
 all
 want
 to
 get
 back
 in
 the
 game


because
 we
 have
 six
 human
 needs.


Certainty,


uncertainty,
 because
 think
 about
 this.


If
 you
 were
 certain
 every
 moment
 of
 your


life,
 you
 know
 what
 someone's
 going
 to


say,
 and
 I'm
 sure
 you've
 had
 this


somewhat.
 You
 know
 what
 they're
 going
 to


say
 before
 they're
 going
 to
 say
 it.
 But


if
 you
 knew
 what
 someone's
 going to
 say


before
 they're
 going
 to
 say,
 you
 know


what's
 going
 to
 happen
 before
 it's
 going


to
 happen
 every
 moment
 of
 every
 day.
 In


the
 beginning,
 it'd
 be
 cool.
 But
 after
 a


while,
 what
 would
 you
 feel?


>> Bored.


>> Out
 of
 your
 mind.
 Bored.


>> So
 God
 in
 her
 infinite
 wisdom
 gave
 us


uncertainty.
 We
 need
 variety.
 We
 need


surprise.
 So
 I
 ask
 people,
 you
 got
 a


stadium,
 15,000
 people,
 and
 I
 say,
 "How


many
 you
 love
 surprises?"
 And
 everybody


raised
 their
 hand,
 "Yay!"
 And
 I
 go,


"Bullshit.
 You
 love
 the
 surprises
 you


want."
 The
 surprises
 you
 don't
 want,
 you


call
 problems,
 but
 we
 need
 those,
 too.


Right?
 Third
 need
 is
 significance.
 They


need
 to
 feel
 unique.
 You
 need
 to
 feel


special.
 The
 need
 to
 feel
 important.
 Who


do
 you
 think
 has
 that
 need?


>> All
 of
 us.


>> Everyone.


>> Yeah.


>> Now,
 some
 people
 like
 Donald
 Trump
 is


pretty
 obvious,
 right?
 And
 some
 people


though
 it's
 like
 I
 don't
 want


significance.
 I
 don't want
 to
 be
 I
 don't


want
 to
 be
 special.
 That's
 only
 because


they
 feel
 if
 they
 get
 special
 they
 get


attacked.


>> Right?
 Every
 some
 people
 do
 it
 by


earrings.
 Some
 people
 buy
 tattoos
 in


certain
 areas.
 Some
 by
 knowing
 bot
 box


scores
 about
 a
 sport
 more
 than
 anybody


else.
 Some
 people
 buy
 their
 art.
 Some


people
 the
 way
 they
 dress.
 Some
 people


buy
 their
 money.
 Some
 people
 be
 more


generous.
 Everyone
 finds
 a
 way.
 Okay.


However,
 some
 people
 do
 it
 through


violence.


>> Okay.
 So
 let
 me
 give
 you
 another
 seed.


>> Why
 has
 violence
 always
 been
 with
 us?
 If


I
 feel
 I'm
 insignificant,
 and
 this
 is,


by
 the
 way,
 even
 more
 powerful
 in
 most


men's
 cases
 because
 the
 nature
 of


testosterone,
 right?
 Testosterone
 is


about
 significance.
 It's
 about
 being


dominant,
 right?
 So,
 if
 I'm
 uh
 I'm
 in
 a


community
 and
 I'm
 driving
 by
 or
 I'm


walking
 by
 this
 community
 and
 it's
 a


tough
 community,
 a
 tough
 environment,


somebody
 comes
 up,
 puts
 a
 gun
 to
 my


head.
 I've
 never
 met
 him
 in
 my
 life.


Why?
 Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 how
 certain
 do


you
 think
 that
 person
 is
 you're
 going to


respond
 when
 they
 put
 a
 gun
 to
 your


head?
 Before
 you
 may
 not
 have
 paid


attention
 to
 them,
 but
 you're
 going
 to


pay
 attention
 now.
 How
 significant
 are


they
 in
 your
 life
 on
 a
 0
 to10
 scale
 with


that
 gun
 to
 your
 head?
 They're
 the
 most


significant
 thing
 on
 earth.
 And
 by
 the


way,
 every
 time
 it's
 a
 little
 different.


They
 give
 variety.
 Anytime
 you
 meet
 a


belief,
 an
 emotion,
 or
 a
 behavior
 meets


at
 least
 three
 of
 these
 six
 needs,
 you


will
 become
 addicted
 to
 that
 thought,


that
 feeling,
 or
 that
 behavior.
 It
 could


be
 a
 positive
 one
 or
 a
 negative
 one,
 but


you
 will
 become
 addicted
 to
 it.
 So


violence
 connects
 those
 three,


but
 you
 can
 also
 get
 significance
 by


tearing
 other
 people
 down.
 So
 why
 do
 we


have
 so
 many
 warriors
 in
 their
 little


house,
 you
 know,
 doing
 their
 little


virtual
 signaling,
 doing
 what
 they're


doing,
 cuz
 they've
 never
 done
 anything


with
 their
 life.
 And
 it
 used
 to
 be
 I'd


have
 to
 confront
 you.
 Now
 I
 don't


confront
 you
 who
 don't
 even
 know
 who
 I


am.
 I
 can
 say
 all
 this
 terrible
 [ __ ]
 and


I'm
 sitting
 my
 little
 place
 and
 make
 my


seal
 feel
 significant
 because
 I
 make
 you


smaller,
 I'm
 bigger.
 It's
 why
 social


media
 is
 so
 terrible.
 There's
 great


things
 in
 social
 media.
 That's
 what's
 so


terrible
 about
 it.
 It's
 like
 people
 now


can
 meet
 their
 need
 for
 significance


without
 much
 effort.
 No
 consequence.
 You


come
 and
 say
 this
 directly
 to
 me,
 you're


going
 to
 pay
 a
 price
 of
 some
 sort,


right?
 That's
 no
 longer
 there.
 Now,


fourth
 need,
 connection
 and
 love.


Everybody
 wants
 love.
 Most
 people
 settle


for
 connection
 because
 they've
 had
 love


at
 one
 point.
 It
 was
 so
 painful
 when
 it


ended.
 They
 decided
 to
 settle
 for


connection.
 How
 can
 you
 get
 it?
 You
 can


get
 it
 by
 going
 for
 a
 run
 and
 feeling


connected
 to
 God
 of
 the
 universe,


nature.
 You
 can
 get
 it
 by
 prayer.
 You


can
 get
 it
 by
 uh
 being
 with
 some


friends.
 You
 can
 get
 it
 by
 making
 love.


You
 can
 get
 it
 by
 getting
 a
 dog.
 If


nothing
 else,
 get
 a
 dog.
 Don't
 get
 a


cat.
 Cats
 leave.
 But
 you
 know,
 dogs,
 you


leave
 for
 2
 minutes.
 It's
 like
 you've


been
 gone
 for
 6
 months.
 They'll
 make
 you


feel
 very
 loved.
 There's
 a
 million
 ways


to
 feel
 connection
 and
 love.
 Some
 are


positive,
 some
 are
 negative.
 Some
 people


get
 connected
 by
 their
 problems.
 They're


always
 comparing
 problems.
 You
 ever
 seen


two
 people
 comparing?
 But
 I
 have
 this.


Well,
 you
 think
 that's
 bad.
 Let
 me
 tell


you
 my
 they're
 arguing
 over
 significance


and
 they're
 connecting
 through
 their


problems.
 Right?
 So
 the
 biggest
 drug
 on


earth
 is
 not
 cocaine.
 It's
 not
 fentanyl.


It's
 not
 dope.
 It's
 problems.
 Cuz
 the


deepest
 fear
 everybody
 has
 is
 they're


not
 enough.
 And
 our
 deeper
 fear
 is
 if


we're
 not
 enough,
 we
 won't
 be
 loved.


I've
 never
 met
 a
 human
 being.
 I've


worked
 with
 kings,
 queens,
 winners
 of


everything
 you
 can
 imagine,
 academy


awards,
 scientists.


There's
 some
 point
 in
 which
 you
 might


feel
 for
 someone
 you
 care
 about
 most


that
 you're
 not
 smart
 enough,
 young


enough,
 old
 enough,
 pretty
 enough,
 funny


enough,
 rich
 enough,
 playful
 enough,


something
 enough.
 And
 it
 is
 the
 worst


feeling
 on
 earth.
 To
 feel
 like
 you
 are


unloved
 and
 worthless
 is
 internal
 death.


So
 people
 come
 up
 with
 a
 story,
 it's


just
 cuz
 I
 have,
 you
 know,
 um
 I
 have


this
 dyslexia,
 that's
 why.
 Or
 it's
 cuz
 I


was
 raped.
 And
 maybe
 they
 really
 were


raped.
 It's
 I'd
 like
 to
 kill
 the
 guy


that
 hurt
 them.
 But
 that's
 not
 why


they're
 feeling
 what
 they're
 feeling


right
 now.
 It's
 because
 they're
 fearful.


And
 so
 if
 you
 have
 a
 big
 problem,
 that's


why
 I'm
 not
 where
 I
 want
 to
 be.
 It's
 not


that
 I'm
 not
 enough
 and
 not
 worthy
 of


love.
 And
 so
 people
 use
 problems
 as
 a


way
 to
 connect.
 Now
 these
 first
 four


needs,
 certainty,
 uncertainty,
 you
 can


see
 how
 they'd
 have
 a
 conflict.
 But
 have


you
 ever
 rented
 a
 movie
 you've
 already


watched?


>> Yeah.


>> Get
 a
 life.


I
 have
 too.
 Why
 would
 we
 do
 that?
 Cuz


we're
 certain
 it's
 good,
 but
 it's
 been


long
 enough
 that
 we
 hope
 it's
 been


there's
 a
 variety.
 We
 won't
 remember
 it


all.
 Have
 a
 variety
 once
 again.
 Yeah.


>> So
 you
 can
 meet
 multiple
 needs
 through


the
 same
 task
 potentially.
 But


certainty,
 uncertainty,
 significance.


Here
 you
 are
 in
 Hollywood.
 Why
 do
 people


come
 to
 Hollywood?


>> Be
 famous
 and


>> be
 famous,
 right?
 They
 don't know
 what


that
 really
 is.
 If
 they
 did,
 some
 of


them
 would
 move
 away
 from
 it.
 But


significance
 is
 what
 they're
 looking


for.
 But
 what
 they
 really
 want
 is
 love.


That's
 what
 everybody
 wants.


>> But
 you
 know what
 the
 problem
 is?
 They


think
 if
 they're
 significant,
 everyone's


going
 to
 love
 them.
 And
 I
 get
 these


clients
 without
 mentioning
 any
 names,


the
 biggest
 names
 in
 Hollywood,
 the


biggest
 names
 in
 sports.
 And
 you
 know


what
 their
 number
 one
 thing
 is?
 They're


angry.
 Why
 are
 they
 angry?
 Because
 they


thought
 if
 I'm
 significant,
 everybody


love
 me.
 And
 now
 they
 go,
 people
 rip
 me


online.
 They
 interrupt
 me
 with
 my
 family


trying
 to
 have
 dinner.
 They
 don't
 give
 a


[ __ ]
 about
 me.
 They
 just
 want
 a
 picture.


They
 just
 want
 this.
 And
 if
 I
 don't
 do


it,
 they
 write
 that
 about
 me.


>> They
 care
 about
 themselves.


>> They
 care
 about
 themselves.
 And
 so
 what


happened
 is
 I
 thought
 by
 being


significant,
 I
 would
 be
 loved.
 And
 now


I'm
 super
 significant
 and
 I'm
 not
 loved.


I'm
 attacked.


Because
 the
 more
 you
 try
 and
 push
 your


significance
 on
 someone,
 the
 less


significant
 they
 make
 you.
 If
 you
 love


someone,
 there's
 nothing
 more


significant
 than
 that.
 True
 love,
 not
 a


trade,
 not
 I'll
 love
 you
 if
 you
 give
 me


something.
 Genuine
 love.
 And
 if
 that


happens,
 you
 become
 significant
 in


people's
 lives.
 But
 that's
 the
 number


one
 challenge
 in
 this
 community.
 So


significance
 is
 love
 attack.
 If
 you're


significant,
 you're
 the
 individual.
 But


I
 need
 to
 be
 connected.
 Well,
 if
 I'm
 so


connected,
 who
 am
 I?
 And
 that's
 the


pull.
 The
 secret
 to
 it
 all
 are
 the
 final


two
 needs.
 These
 are
 the
 spiritual


needs.
 Not
 religious,
 but
 spiritual.
 And


that
 is
 we
 all
 must
 grow.
 When
 you
 grow,


you
 feel
 alive.
 And
 if
 you
 don't
 grow,


you
 start
 to
 die
 inside.
 And
 this
 isn't


my
 rule.
 Everything
 in
 the
 universe


grows
 or
 dies.
 As
 you
 well
 know,
 this
 is


the
 law
 of
 the
 universe.
 If
 your


relationship's
 not
 growing,
 it's
 dying.


Don't
 [ __ ]
 yourself.
 If
 your


business
 is
 not
 growing,
 you're
 a


businessman.
 You
 know
 it
 is
 not
 growing.


It
 is
 dying.
 You
 better
 do
 something


now.
 Right?
 But
 we
 grow
 so
 we
 have


something
 finally
 to
 give
 which
 is
 where


meaning
 comes
 in
 life.
 When
 I
 grow
 I


have
 something
 more
 to
 give.
 And
 if
 I


can
 give
 that
 to
 someone
 then
 my
 life
 is


more
 meaningful
 than
 just
 the
 pleasure


of
 I
 have
 the
 machine
 that
 you
 know


makes
 me
 feel
 pleasure
 in
 certain
 parts


of
 my
 body
 and
 feeds
 me
 and
 all
 the


things
 you
 talked
 about.
 If
 you
 went
 to


Vegas
 and
 you
 pull
 down
 that
 you
 know


that
 little
 jukebox
 thing
 and
 you
 get


boom
 boom
 boom
 bars
 bars
 bars
 what's


your
 reaction?


>> Amazing.


>> Amazing.
 Wow,
 this
 is
 And
 you
 pull
 it
 a


second
 time
 and
 you
 get
 it
 again.


>> Amazing.


>> And
 you
 do
 a
 third
 time
 and
 you
 get
 it


again.


>> Less
 amazing.


>> And
 now
 you
 do
 a
 100
 times.


>> Yeah.
 Less
 amazing.


>> And
 now
 what
 you
 have
 is
 a
 job.
 You
 do


this
 and
 you
 got
 a
 predictable
 outcome.


The
 fact
 that
 you
 don't
 know
 what
 the


outcome
 is
 that
 that's
 the
 jackpot
 in
 it


that
 gets
 someone
 hooked
 on
 anything.


That's
 what
 makes
 it
 significant
 because


it's
 scarce.
 Right?
 So
 when
 you
 do
 this,


if
 I
 said
 to
 you,
 Osama
 bin
 Laden,
 what


would
 you
 say
 his
 top
 need
 driving


force?
 Was
 it
 certainty?
 Was
 it
 variety?


Was
 it
 significance?
 Was
 it
 love?
 Was
 it


growth
 or
 contribution?


>> I'd
 say
 probably
 significance


>> 100%.
 He
 was
 one
 of
 I
 forgot
 the
 number.


27
 children,
 right?
 Literally,
 he
 was
 27


children.
 He
 was
 a
 nobody.
 He
 took
 his


dad's
 money.
 He
 was
 not
 very
 religious


and
 he
 went
 to
 Afghanistan
 and
 he
 used


his
 money
 and
 became
 significant
 not
 by


shooting
 people.
 He
 provided
 resources


and
 then
 all
 of a
 sudden
 his
 entire
 life


changed.
 How
 do
 you
 know?
 The
 most


significant
 thing
 is
 he
 sent
 other


people
 to
 die.


>> He
 didn't
 go
 to
 die.
 He
 sent
 other


people.
 Now
 his
 number
 one
 drive
 is


significance
 and
 his
 way
 of
 doing
 it
 was


get
 other
 people
 to
 die.
 On
 that
 same


day
 in
 9/11,
 there
 were
 men
 and
 women
 in


the
 fire
 department,
 police
 department


who
 went
 into
 those
 buildings
 knowing
 it


a
 good
 chance
 they
 would
 die
 to
 save
 a


stranger.


Also
 driven
 by
 significance
 but
 with


different
 rules.


If
 I
 die
 a
 hero,
 my
 life
 is
 meaningful.


And
 that's
 a
 meaningful
 life.


So
 people
 can
 even
 have
 the
 same
 need


structure,
 but
 their
 beliefs
 about
 how


to
 meet
 those
 needs
 are
 the
 most


important
 thing.
 And
 the
 needs
 of


connection
 and
 love,
 growth,
 and


contribution
 have
 no
 downside.
 Certainty


make
 if
 you
 have
 certainty
 is
 your


number
 one
 thing,
 you're
 always
 trying


to
 keep
 life
 the
 same
 way,
 and
 you're


going
 to
 be
 stressed
 out.
 Especially


with
 AI,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 really


stressed
 out.
 If
 you're
 a
 variety


person,
 you
 can
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 fun,
 but


eventually
 not
 much
 variety.
 The
 life


you
 described
 for
 all
 these
 people
 now,


they
 have
 the
 money,
 they
 have
 the
 sex,


they
 have
 this,
 they
 have
 that,
 they


have
 the
 woman,
 they
 have
 the
 notoriety,


they
 have
 the
 Academy
 Award.
 It
 all
 gets


old
 because
 if
 we're
 not
 growing,
 it


doesn't
 matter.
 How
 many
 people
 do
 you


know
 that
 were
 famous,
 who
 were
 rich,


who
 had
 supposedly
 everything
 people


want
 and
 took
 their
 own
 life?
 Why'
 they


take
 their
 life?
 They
 stopped
 growing


and
 stopped
 having
 a
 sense
 of
 meaning
 by


giving.
 You
 could
 show
 I
 can
 show
 you


example
 after
 example
 of
 people.
 So


these
 need
 structures
 in
 the
 new
 world


have
 to
 be
 met.
 We
 can
 meet
 certainty


right
 now
 very
 easily
 by
 going
 online


and
 controlling
 our
 communication.


That's
 why
 people
 text.
 That's
 much


easier
 than
 communicating
 back
 and
 forth


with
 someone,
 right?
 We
 can
 get
 variety


by
 going
 online
 so
 easily.
 Now
 we
 can


get
 significance,
 tear
 other
 people
 down


or
 work
 on
 something
 significant.
 We


think
 right
 AI
 explore
 the
 world.
 We
 can


get
 a
 sense
 of
 connection
 through
 people


online
 or
 through
 a
 robot
 or
 these
 days


people
 have
 an
 AI
 and
 they
 talk
 to
 it


like
 it's
 their
 boyfriend
 or
 girlfriend


because
 it
 totally
 affirms
 them.
 They


say
 something
 idiotic
 and
 they
 tell
 you


you're
 so
 smart,
 right?
 Get
 better,


right?
 But
 you're
 missing
 growing
 and


contributing.
 If
 you're
 missing
 growing,


contributing,
 you
 will
 not
 feel


fulfilled.
 you
 as
 a
 person,
 if
 I've
 read


your
 books
 correctly,
 and
 I
 didn't
 read


them
 all,
 but
 I've
 had
 pieces
 of
 it.


Probably
 the
 best
 lesson
 you
 got
 early


in
 life
 was


there's
 the
 science
 of
 achievement.


There's
 the
 art
 of
 fulfillment.
 They're


two
 different
 skills.
 If
 you
 want
 an


extraordinary
 life,
 you
 need
 both.
 You


go
 to
 the
 east,
 they're
 really
 great


about
 fulfillment.
 They
 can
 live
 in


poverty
 and
 feel
 totally
 happy
 and


connected
 to
 God
 or
 the
 universe.
 You


come
 here
 and
 and
 people
 can
 have
 an


incredible
 external
 life,
 but
 their


internal
 life
 often
 not
 so
 nice.
 They


get
 really
 pissed
 off
 because
 they


didn't
 get
 their
 special
 sauce
 on
 their


burger,
 right?
 It's
 a
 different
 world.
 I


believe
 you
 can
 merge
 those
 two.
 How?


You
 master
 the
 science
 of
 achievement.


There
 are
 rules
 to
 achieve.
 As
 you
 well


know,
 you
 wrote
 a
 whole
 book
 with
 33


rules
 in
 it.
 Me,
 too.
 Right?
 So,
 I
 know


those
 rules.
 I
 know.
 I
 wrote
 books
 on


finance.
 Three
 of
 them.
 I
 want
 an


answer.
 Is
 it
 still
 possible
 to
 win
 the


financial
 game?
 Because
 so
 many
 young


people
 think
 it
 can't
 be
 done.
 So,
 I


interviewed
 50
 of
 the
 greatest
 financial


people
 alive
 today.
 All
 started
 with


nothing.
 All
 billionaires.
 Nobody
 from


the
 Lucky
 Sperm
 Club.
 They
 all
 did
 it
 on


their
 own.
 Ray
 Dalio,
 Carl
 Icon,
 Warren


Buffett,
 all
 of
 them.
 And
 guess
 what
 I


found?
 They're
 all
 different,
 but
 I'm
 a


modeler.
 I
 found
 the
 strategies
 that
 are


common
 between
 them
 and
 I
 applied
 them.


I
 taught
 other
 people,
 wrote
 the
 books,


but
 I
 applied
 them
 myself.
 And
 that's


how
 my
 businesses
 and
 my
 life
 grew


geometrically.
 I
 modeled,
 I
 didn't
 have


to
 learn
 on
 my
 own
 experience.
 You


follow?


>> I've
 got
 to
 ask
 you
 some
 questions
 on


those
 two
 points.
 So
 on
 these
 six
 needs,


because
 I
 also
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 about
 the


the
 50
 rich
 people
 that
 you've
 you've


interviewed
 for
 the
 books,
 but
 on
 those


six
 needs,
 when
 you
 look
 at
 someone
 like


me
 and
 you
 look
 at
 the
 broad
 world
 that


I'm
 heading
 towards
 as
 a
 30
 30-year-old


man,
 what
 what
 configuration
 of
 these


needs?


Well,
 I'll
 tell
 you
 what
 creates
 all
 the


pain
 first.


>> Okay,
 please.


>> So
 if
 I
 go
 to
 a
 room
 and
 I'll
 say
 I
 I


explain
 these
 needs
 like
 I
 have
 I
 know


this
 is
 kind
 of
 lecture
 here.
 I
 didn't


mean
 to
 be
 that,
 but
 I
 just
 want
 to


share
 because
 I'm
 so
 passionate
 about


it.
 And
 I'll
 get
 people
 to
 understand


what
 they
 are.
 And
 then
 I
 ask
 them,
 I


want
 you
 to
 write
 down
 what
 you
 think


your
 top
 two
 needs
 have
 been.
 Not
 in


what
 you
 want,
 but
 in
 the
 way
 you've


been
 living.
 Because
 people
 might
 want


love,
 but
 they
 think
 they
 have
 to
 be


significant
 before
 they
 can
 get
 it.
 Or


they
 might
 want
 love,
 but
 they
 want


certainty
 that
 love
 never
 go
 away.
 You


follow
 me?
 And
 so
 that
 modifies
 things.


And
 I'll
 say,
 "So
 the
 way
 you've
 lived,


the
 way
 you've
 lived,
 what
 would
 have


been
 the
 top
 two?"
 And
 then
 I
 say,
 I


want
 you
 to
 write
 a
 paragraph
 about


what's
 the
 downside
 of
 having
 that
 one


so
 high
 on
 your
 list.
 And
 it's
 amazing.


So
 then
 I
 say,
 now
 write
 what
 you
 think


your
 list
 top
 two
 should
 be
 to
 go
 to
 the


next
 level
 of
 your
 life.
 Okay.
 Let's
 how


you
 do
 that.
 What
 do
 you
 think
 your
 top


two
 means?
 I
 see
 you
 doing
 it
 already,


which
 I
 love.
 I
 love
 how
 active
 you
 are.


So
 what
 would
 you
 say
 your
 top
 two
 have


been
 up
 until
 now?


>> I
 think
 if
 I'm
 being
 completely
 honest.


>> Yes.
 And
 now,
 by
 the
 way,
 by
 the
 way,
 I


I
 want
 to
 thank
 you
 because
 I
 watched


several
 of your
 pieces
 and
 you
 are


you're
 not
 bullshitting
 about
 good.


>> There's
 just
 no
 I'm
 going
 to
 die


someday.
 So,
 there's
 no
 even
 if
 being


honest
 makes
 me
 look
 bad.
 It
 just
 [ __ ]


who
 cares.
 My
 of
 course,
 like


significance,
 of
 course,
 especially
 from


where
 I,
 you
 know,
 where
 I
 came
 from.


>> That
 was
 the
 big
 problem
 was,
 you
 know,


being
 different
 and
 and
 not
 in
 a
 good


way.
 That's
 right.
 And
 then
 I
 would
 say


um


interestingly
 it
 feels
 like
 uncertainty


and
 significance
 are
 really
 really
 high


for
 me
 because


>> Yes.
 Yes.


>> I've
 for
 some
 reason
 I
 have
 a
 very
 a


huge
 appetite
 for
 uncertainty.


>> Yeah.
 Well,


you're
 wired
 that
 way
 in
 a
 beautiful


way.
 It
 also
 leads
 to
 learning
 for
 you.


That's
 one
 of
 your
 vehicles
 for


learning,
 is
 it
 not?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Dropping
 out
 of
 school,
 stopping
 going


to
 school
 when
 I
 was
 younger,
 dropping


out
 of
 university.


>> Um
 quitting
 jobs
 where
 you
 know
 I


shouldn't
 have
 quit
 them
 after
 a
 month.


Which
 by
 the
 way,
 if
 certainty
 was
 your


top
 need,
 would
 you
 have
 done
 that?


>> No.


>> No.
 Completely.
 So
 you
 understand
 this.


These
 are
 I'm
 talking
 about
 the
 six


controlling
 forces
 of
 your
 life.
 There's


a
 million
 stories
 about
 your
 life,
 but


there's
 only
 six
 reasons
 you
 do


anything.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 have
 all
 these
 stories
 with
 reasons.


So
 what
 would
 you
 say
 would
 be
 the


downside
 of
 that?
 There
 would
 have been


upsides,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Great.
 Yeah.


>> We're
 sitting
 here
 because
 of
 the


upsides.
 Your
 desire
 for
 significance


made
 you
 look
 for
 significant
 ideas,


significant
 application,
 succeed
 in


business.
 The
 downsides
 of
 wanting


significance
 is


>> at
 the
 at
 the
 top,
 not
 cuz
 it's


valuable.
 Significance
 is
 valuable


period.
 Everyone
 should
 want
 it.
 But


it's
 the
 sequence.
 So
 if
 it's
 the
 top
 of


your
 list,
 what's
 the
 downside?


>> For
 me,
 it
 costs
 me
 connection
 and
 love


and
 all
 these
 and
 some
 of
 these
 other


opportunities.


>> That's
 correct.
 Which
 is
 what
 you
 really


want
 underneath
 it
 all?


>> Yeah.


>> Your
 desire
 for
 significance
 really
 came


from
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 were
 not
 loved


and
 connected
 by
 people.
 People
 judge


you
 the
 color
 of
 your
 skin.
 They
 put
 you


in
 a
 community
 where
 you
 were
 different.


you
 were
 outside
 the
 so
 it's
 like


>> I'll
 show
 them


>> right
 which
 by
 the
 way
 was
 a
 very


healthy
 response
 right
 but
 now
 at
 this


stage
 of
 your
 life


>> this
 is
 the
 gift
 that
 you
 have
 now
 at


this
 stage
 of
 your
 life
 right
 you're


entering
 this
 second
 season
 right


>> now
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 be
 driven
 by
 that


anymore


>> you
 already
 are
 significant
 like
 what


more
 are
 you
 going to
 do
 that's
 not


significant
 I'm
 sure
 you'll
 find
 more


significant
 things
 to
 do
 but
 you've
 done


so
 many
 significant
 things
 you've
 helped


millions
 of
 people
 I'm
 sure
 through
 your


insights
 your
 elements
 you've
 written


books
 you've
 built
 businesses
 and
 you're


only
 33
 years
 old.
 That's
 pretty
 effing


awesome,
 right?
 So,
 now
 you
 get
 the


leisure
 of
 be
 able
 to
 sit
 back
 and
 say,


now
 with
 a
 greater
 level
 of


consciousness,
 what
 would
 ideally
 be
 my


top
 two?
 What
 would
 you
 say
 your
 top
 two


need
 to
 be
 to
 have
 the
 next
 level
 of


your
 life
 to
 go
 to
 the
 next
 level
 for


you?


>> It
 was
 really
 easy
 for
 me
 to
 answer
 this


question.
 Um,
 connection
 and
 love
 and


the
 the
 need
 to
 grow
 and
 give.


>> Yes.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 Well,
 those
 are
 two


different
 ones.
 Contribution.
 Growth
 and


contribution.
 Of
 of
 those
 two,
 which
 one


do
 you
 think
 is
 even
 more
 important
 for


you?


>> Oh,
 god.
 of
 those
 two.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 hard
 because
 one
 you
 can
 see


as
 a
 vehicle
 to
 the
 other.
 Exactly.
 I


understand
 that.
 But
 I'm
 asking
 a


different
 question.
 I'm
 saying
 which
 is


more
 important
 to
 feel
 experience.


>> It
 would
 be
 contribution.


>> Yes.
 So
 for
 you,
 you're
 saying
 love
 and


contribution.


>> I'm
 saying
 love
 and
 contribution.


>> In
 what
 order?


>> Love
 first
 and
 then
 contribution.


>> It's
 a
 good
 choice.


>> I
 tried
 in
 my
 head.
 I
 tried
 the
 other


way
 around
 and
 I
 thought
 no.
 It's
 almost


that
 like
 monks
 have
 said
 to
 me
 many


years
 ago
 that
 you
 need
 to
 fill
 up
 your


cup
 so
 you
 have
 something
 to
 pour
 out


for
 others.


>> Yes.
 And
 that's
 what
 I
 was
 thinking
 of.


I
 was
 thinking
 it
 doesn't
 work
 the
 other


way
 around.


>> That
 was
 that
 was
 a
 wise
 wise
 choice.


Most
 people
 wouldn't
 make
 that
 choice.
 I


for
 most
 of
 my
 life
 was
 contribution


first
 and
 then
 love.
 It
 was
 my
 way
 of


earning
 love.


>> And
 so
 like
 I'd
 be
 on
 stage
 for
 13
 hours


and
 this
 is
 before
 people
 had
 phones
 and


everybody
 wants
 to
 sign
 something
 and


give
 me
 a
 hug.
 I
 work
 my
 guts
 out
 and


then
 that
 was
 my
 take
 it
 in
 time.
 So
 I'd


be
 there
 finish
 at
 1:30
 or
 2
 in
 the


morning
 and
 I'd
 be
 there
 till
 3:30
 till


every
 person
 had
 an
 autograph,
 got,
 you


know,
 their
 hug
 and
 everything
 else.
 Now


it's
 pictures
 a
 lot
 faster.
 But
 that
 was


my
 life.
 I
 met
 my
 wife,
 Sage.
 Changed
 my


entire
 life.
 She
 didn't
 care
 that
 I
 was


Tony
 Robbins.
 She
 just
 loved
 me.
 And
 all


of a
 sudden,
 I
 never
 thought
 12,000,


15,000,
 20,000
 people
 could
 of
 love


pouring
 out.
 You
 could
 compare,
 one


person
 compare,
 but
 way
 beyond
 that.
 So


now
 I
 finish
 it.
 When
 I
 give
 my
 guts,
 I


go
 to
 1
 in
 the
 morning,
 but
 then
 I
 get


up
 and
 I
 leave,
 right?
 you
 know,
 I
 take


pictures
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 day,
 but


then
 I
 leave
 at
 that
 time
 and
 I
 go
 and


be
 with
 my
 wife
 and
 it
 switched
 to
 where


love
 was
 there.
 Because
 think
 about


this,
 if
 contribution
 is
 first,
 and
 this


is
 what
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 do,
 then
 it's
 a


way
 to
 protect
 yourself
 from
 feeling


rejected
 because
 if
 I
 I'm
 always
 giving


to
 you
 truly
 generously
 over
 beyond
 what


you
 can
 imagine
 and
 then
 you
 treat
 me


like
 [ __ ]
 Well,
 then
 you're
 clearly
 the


problem,
 right?
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 think


I'm
 not
 enough.


>> So,
 but
 the
 more
 honest
 way
 is
 love.


Because
 if
 it's
 love
 first,
 now
 I'm


giving
 because
 I
 want
 to,
 not
 cuz
 I
 have


to.
 Does
 that
 make
 sense?
 So
 tell
 me
 how


you
 think
 that
 would
 change
 your
 life
 if


you
 made
 love
 and
 contribution
 your
 top


two
 and
 the
 way
 you
 actually
 live


because
 you
 already
 value
 love
 and


contribution.
 But
 if
 they
 were
 the


highest
 priority,
 how
 would
 it
 shift


your
 life
 for
 the
 better
 in
 your
 mind?


>> I
 feel
 like
 I
 would
 be
 significantly


less
 stressed.


>> You
 are
 correct.
 You
 are
 absolutely


correct.
 So
 when
 I
 ask
 the
 audience


this,
 I
 have
 them
 write
 down
 and
 I've


got
 15,000
 people
 and
 I'll
 say,
 "Okay,


how
 many
 have
 certainty
 on
 your
 list?"


and
 they've
 come
 to
 an
 event
 that
 has
 a


firewalk,
 right?
 And
 you
 get
 like
 50
 60%


of
 the
 rooms
 on
 the
 top
 in
 their
 top
 two


of
 their
 list,
 right?
 Because
 it's
 the


in
 our
 culture,
 it's
 still
 the
 most


important
 one.
 It's
 the
 foundational.


It's
 the
 one
 that's
 going
 to
 have
 the


biggest
 problem
 with
 AI
 because
 they


want
 things
 to
 stay
 the
 same
 and
 life


isn't.
 The
 only
 thing
 is
 for
 certain
 is


change.
 And
 now
 rapid
 change,
 like


geometrically
 rapid
 change.
 Okay.


Variety,
 small
 number,
 significance


through
 the
 roof.
 Social
 media
 has
 made


significance
 disproportionate
 in
 our


culture
 and
 it's
 why
 people
 are
 so


unhappy.
 You
 used
 to
 maybe
 compare
 most


yourself
 to
 your
 neighbors
 or
 your


friends.
 Now
 you
 compare
 yourself
 to
 a


billionaires
 of
 which
 there's
 only


3,000,
 right?
 And
 so
 you're
 like,
 "My


life's
 not
 that
 great
 anymore."
 Or
 you


compare
 it
 to
 pictures
 that
 have
 been


doctorred.
 I
 have a
 friend
 of
 mine
 owns


a
 gym
 and
 he
 says,
 "Tony,
 you
 can't


believe
 it.
 Women
 and
 men
 come
 in
 here


who
 are
 influencers.
 They
 lay
 everything


out
 and
 then
 they
 do
 their
 video
 and


they
 never
 work
 out.
 They're
 27
 years


old.
 They
 don't
 have
 to
 work
 out
 for


[ __ ]
 I
 mean,
 it's
 like
 they
 do
 a


minimum
 workout.
 They
 got
 jeans.
 They're


just
 fine.
 They
 don't
 even
 do
 the


workout.
 It's
 all
 pictures.
 It's
 all


[ __ ]
 right?
 You
 know,
 he
 goes,
 "It


makes
 me
 so
 mad
 because,
 you
 know,
 real


people
 there
 working
 hard
 to
 make


something
 happen."
 So,
 that's
 why
 people


get
 so
 women
 especially
 depressed


comparing
 themselves
 to
 images
 that
 are


not
 even
 real,
 right?
 It's
 totally


absurd.
 So,
 when
 I
 deal
 with
 the


audience
 though,
 certainty
 and


significance
 is
 80%
 of
 the
 room,
 right?


There's
 growth
 people,
 contribution


people,
 but
 that's
 the
 dominant
 force


because
 of
 our
 cultural
 conditioning.


And
 because
 certainty
 is
 basically


survival
 tool
 then
 I've
 asked
 them
 to
 do


what
 you
 did
 and
 I
 say
 okay
 tell
 me
 I


don't
 tell
 them
 anything
 like
 I
 didn't


tell
 you
 anything
 and
 then
 I
 say
 okay


who
 has
 certainty
 on
 their
 list
 now
 and


in
 a
 room
 of
 15,000
 people
 12,000
 people


there
 might
 be
 like
 five.
 Okay,
 there's


five
 people
 that
 really
 like
 pain.
 So
 I


point
 that
 out
 to
 them
 and
 they
 look
 at


me
 and
 then
 I
 go
 okay
 how
 many
 got
 you


know
 variety?
 It'll
 be
 more
 variety.
 How


many
 got
 significance?
 the
 number


plummets
 just
 like
 it
 did
 with
 you.


People
 I
 didn't
 tell
 them
 anything.


Their
 own
 intelligence
 knows
 this,


right?


>> How
 many
 got
 love
 through
 the
 roof,


right?
 Contribution
 through
 the
 roof.


Growth
 through
 the
 roof.
 Those
 are
 the


ones
 that
 expand.
 And
 then
 we
 show


people
 how
 to
 condition
 that
 though


because
 it's
 one
 thing
 to
 know
 it.
 It's


another
 thing
 to
 start
 training
 it
 in


your
 body
 to
 make
 those
 priorities


happen
 in
 your
 life.
 Right?
 Just
 like


any
 other
 habit,
 lurking
 out
 or
 anything


else,
 you
 have
 to
 build
 the
 neurology
 of


that.
 You
 have
 to
 practice
 putting


yourself
 in
 those
 states
 over
 and
 over


again
 where
 you
 make
 the
 value
 based
 on


love
 or
 you
 make
 the
 value
 based
 on


contribution.
 See
 before
 you
 do


something
 to
 be
 significant
 and
 you
 miss


out
 on
 some
 of
 the
 love.
 Now
 love
 is


probably
 always
 what
 you
 wanted.
 That's


why
 you
 could
 make
 that
 decision
 so


quickly,
 right?
 But
 now
 I'm
 going
 to
 go


for
 that
 first,
 not
 this
 securitous


route.
 By
 the
 way,
 you
 will
 still
 be


significant.
 You'll
 be
 loving
 first
 and


you'll
 be
 contributing
 and
 that
 will


make
 you
 significant.
 Is
 it
 really


possible
 to
 change
 like
 that
 that


deeply?


>> No,
 not
 at
 all.
 I've
 never
 been
 able
 to


do
 that
 in


>> No,
 no,
 my
 49th
 year.
 I'm
 just
 I've


never
 seen
 that
 happen.


>> No,
 I
 was
 I
 was
 thinking
 really
 really


deeply
 about
 what
 you
 were
 saying
 and
 I


was
 thinking
 there
 will
 be
 some
 people


that
 are
 listening
 and
 I
 think
 there
 was


maybe
 a
 part
 of
 me
 my
 conscious
 that's


like


because
 I
 because
 that's
 a
 journey
 I've


never
 gone
 on
 before.
 I've
 never
 shifted


from
 the


>> Well,
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 do
 it
 by


discussion.
 You
 have
 to
 have
 leverage.


>> What
 is
 that?
 Leverage
 is
 uh
 you
 have
 to


have
 something
 you
 value
 more
 than
 your


present
 way
 of
 doing
 things.
 Leverage


can
 be
 pain
 or
 pleasure,
 right?
 So


>> like
 my
 fiance,


>> your
 fiance,
 you
 got
 understand
 how
 you


got
 to
 LA
 has
 a
 little
 leverage,
 right?


Her
 love,
 her
 happiness,
 her
 joy.
 Oh,


that's
 beautiful.


>> That's
 a
 photo.


>> My
 girl,


>> you
 and
 Sage.


>> That's
 awesome.
 You're
 good
 at
 putting


people
 in
 state
 with
 her
 pictures.


That's
 impressive.


>> That's
 a
 beautiful
 photo.


>> Yeah,
 I
 love
 her
 so
 much.
 And
 we've
 been


together
 25
 years.
 I
 love
 her
 more
 today


than
 ever
 before.
 She
 is
 a
 force
 in


nature,
 this
 woman.
 Really,
 really


great.
 But
 yes,
 she's
 leverage
 in
 my


life.
 My
 my
 my
 youngest
 daughter's


massive
 leverage,
 you
 know,
 four
 and
 a


half
 years
 old.
 It's
 beautiful.
 But
 I'll


give
 you
 an
 example.
 I
 had
 I
 worked
 with


a
 woman
 one
 time
 on
 stage
 and
 she
 was
 a


colon
 therapist
 and
 uh
 vegan
 and
 you


know,
 so
 but
 she
 was
 always
 sick
 cuz


she's
 so
 stressed
 all
 the
 time
 trying
 to


be
 perfect
 at
 everything.
 There's
 just


constriction
 in
 her
 body,
 right?
 And
 um


and
 the
 level
 stress
 was
 just


ridiculous,
 right?
 So
 I
 was
 trying
 to


get
 her
 to
 see
 have
 some
 other
 options


about
 what
 to
 do
 to
 without
 boring
 the


whole
 story.
 I'm
 looking
 for
 leverage


always.
 That's
 how
 you
 get
 someone
 to


make
 a
 change.
 You
 got
 to
 get
 make


change
 a
 must,
 not
 a
 should.
 Not
 me


making
 it
 to
 you.
 If
 I
 put
 a
 gun
 to
 your


head,
 that's
 leverage.
 But
 some
 people


would
 rather
 die
 than
 bend
 to
 your
 will.


You
 have
 to
 find
 out
 what
 moves
 that


person.
 It's
 unique
 for
 everyone,
 not


what
 motivates
 them.
 I
 hate
 the
 word


motivation.
 I've
 never
 used
 it.
 I
 want


to
 know
 your
 drives.
 Look,
 if
 you're


fat,
 you're
 motivated
 to
 eat.
 I
 want
 to


know
 what's
 underneath.
 I
 want to
 know


what
 the
 drives
 are.
 So
 this
 woman,
 I'm


trying
 to
 help
 her
 make
 changes.
 And
 I


show
 her
 these
 things
 and
 see
 the


consequences.
 And
 she
 wouldn't
 change.


Wouldn't
 change.
 So
 finally
 I
 I
 said,


"Man,
 I
 got
 to
 push
 this
 lady."
 I
 was


like,
 I
 said,
 "How
 long
 I
 wouldn't
 tell


her
 this.
 I
 asked
 I
 said,
 "How
 long


would
 a
 person
 with
 a
 level
 of
 stress


with
 these
 things
 you're
 doing
 and
 these


ailments,
 how
 long
 will
 a
 person
 like


that
 live
 if
 they
 don't
 change?"


And
 she
 paused
 and
 she
 thought
 and
 she


said,


"Probably
 to
 35."
 "How
 old
 are
 you?"


"32."


So,
 okay,
 she's
 going
 to
 change
 now.
 I


mean,
 she's
 going to
 do
 it,
 right?


That's
 the
 leverage.
 She's
 got
 to


change.
 But
 I
 can't
 change.
 I
 just


can't.
 It's
 just
 how
 my
 life
 is.


I
 said,
 "Well,"


I
 said,
 "This
 session
 is
 on
 videotape,


you
 know."


And
 I
 said,


"How
 do
 you
 think
 your
 daughter's
 going


to
 feel
 when
 she's
 carrying
 your
 coffin


and
 she
 knows
 that
 you
 knew
 you
 could


shift
 this
 and
 you
 didn't?
 This
 is


pretty
 intense.
 I
 mean,
 she
 thinks
 she's


going
 to
 die.
 If
 she
 doesn't
 do
 it,
 she


probably
 could."
 So,
 I'm
 thinking
 out


big
 leverage,
 right?
 She
 goes,
 "I
 know


that's
 horrible,
 but
 I
 can't
 change."


And
 part
 of
 my
 head,
 I'm
 like,
 "Holy


[ __ ]
 she's
 not
 going
 to
 change
 here.


What
 the
 hell
 is
 going
 to
 change
 her?"


And
 then
 I
 said
 to
 her,
 I
 said,
 "Yeah,


what
 if
 her
 new
 mother
 is
 a
 meat
 eater?"


And
 she
 exploded
 on
 stage.
 That
 is
 not


happening.
 I
 will
 not
 make
 this
 happen.


I
 mean,
 she
 went
 berserk.
 And
 she
 goes,


"Fine,
 I'm
 changing
 this
 now."
 Like,


there
 is
 always
 leverage.
 There
 is


something
 that
 will
 make
 change
 a
 must


and
 not
 a
 should.
 Change
 is
 never
 a


matter
 of
 ability.
 It's
 always
 a
 matter


of
 strong
 enough
 reasons
 of
 motive.
 If


you
 got
 strong
 enough
 reasons,
 you
 can


do
 just
 about
 anything.
 But
 if
 you
 have


weak
 reasons,
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 do


anything.
 So
 the
 fact
 that
 you


understand
 this
 is
 our
 discussion.
 In
 an


event,
 you
 be
 in
 a
 rather
 a
 rather
 peak


state
 and
 I
 take
 you
 through
 a
 process


of
 consequence
 where
 you
 will
 envision


what
 the
 consequences
 are
 and
 then
 you


can
 make
 that
 shift
 and
 you
 still
 got
 to


condition
 it.
 This
 specific
 change
 is


the
 hardest
 one.


>> I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 might
 say
 I
 was


thinking
 forward
 as
 life
 events
 to
 come


and
 becoming
 a
 father.


>> Yes.
 Yes,
 it's
 often


>> that
 will
 do
 that
 will
 absolutely
 shift


a
 lot
 of
 people.
 Becoming
 a
 father,


getting
 married,
 falling
 in
 love.
 There


are
 certain
 events.
 Losing
 people
 will


make
 you
 re-evaluate
 things.
 Hitting
 a


birthday,
 you
 know,
 you're
 33.
 When
 you


hit
 your
 40th
 birthday,
 I'm
 sure
 you


don't
 think
 it'll
 be
 any
 different.
 I


remember
 people
 telling
 me
 that,
 but
 you


tend
 to
 re-evaluate
 for
 some
 weird


reason
 in
 our
 culture.
 And
 after
 40,


usually
 a
 fiveyear
 or


50
 year,
 60
 year.
 It's
 just
 part
 of
 the


way
 we
 look
 at
 life.
 It's
 there's
 a


process
 you
 go
 through
 and
 there
 will
 be


different
 things
 that
 trigger
 you.
 But


when
 you
 want
 a
 real
 lasting
 change,
 you


have
 to
 change
 the
 driving
 force.
 When


we
 change
 these,
 it's
 changing
 your


values.
 So
 again,
 like
 think
 about
 how


your
 brain
 is
 a
 predictor
 and
 it's


trying
 to
 close
 the
 gap
 between
 what


it's
 predicting
 what
 reality
 is.
 When


it's
 not
 working,
 it
 looks
 for
 an


answer.
 When
 you
 get
 to
 the
 point
 where


your
 old
 strategy
 doesn't
 work
 enough


and
 you
 have
 enough
 pain,
 you
 will


search
 for
 something
 new.
 And
 if
 at
 that


time
 we
 can
 give
 you
 something
 that


actually
 works,
 you'll
 grab
 it.
 It's


like
 if
 you're
 drowning
 in
 a
 sea
 of


confusion
 and
 I
 throw
 you
 a
 life
 raft,


you're
 not
 going
 to
 go,
 I
 don't
 like
 the


color.
 You
 know,
 you're
 going
 to
 grab
 a


hold
 and
 it
 comes
 into
 your
 unconscious.


And
 the
 other
 last
 thing
 I'd
 say
 about


that
 is
 it's
 also
 about
 going
 beyond


your
 conscious
 mind.
 Right?
 You're
 if


you
 ever
 try
 to
 do
 something
 and
 then


sabotage
 yourself,
 it's
 consciously
 you


wanted
 one
 thing,
 subconsciously


another.
 I
 believe
 all
 lasting
 change


happens
 in
 an
 altered
 state.
 When
 I
 say


an
 altered
 state,
 you
 could
 call
 it


hypnosis.
 I
 tell
 people
 I'm
 a


dehypnotist.
 Most
 people
 walk
 around
 in


hypnosis.
 People
 tell
 me
 like,
 "You


can't
 hypnotize
 me."
 And
 they're
 they're


in
 a
 hypnotized
 state
 in
 that
 moment.
 Do


you
 ever
 drive
 your
 car
 and
 then


something
 catch
 your
 attention
 and
 you


stay
 focused
 on
 too
 long
 and
 all
 a


sudden
 you
 realize,
 "Holy
 [ __ ]
 who's


been
 driving
 the
 car?"
 You
 ever
 have?


That
 was
 a
 That
 was
 a
 hypnosis
 state.


Hypnosis
 just
 means
 you're
 inside,
 not


outside
 most
 of
 the
 time.
 And
 in
 a


hypnotic
 state,
 what
 goes
 in
 goes
 in


deeper
 than
 just
 in
 a
 consciousness


state.
 That's
 why
 I
 like
 doing


storytelling.
 You
 know,
 I'm
 I'm
 my
 wife


and
 I
 are
 there's
 certain
 things
 in
 life


that
 just
 shouldn't
 happen
 that
 are


inhuman
 and
 trafficking
 is
 one
 of
 them.


And
 we
 had
 a
 friend
 that
 child
 was
 taken


and
 trafficked
 and
 it
 was
 the
 most


brutal
 thing.
 And
 so
 I
 got
 us
 involved


and
 so
 now
 we've
 we've
 contributed
 to


72,000
 children
 being
 saved.
 I've
 gone


out
 on
 some
 of
 these
 undercover
 with


scars
 on
 my
 face
 and
 elements.
 It's
 most


brutal
 thing
 you
 can
 possibly
 imagine.


But
 I
 tell
 you
 this
 because
 when
 you


when
 you
 witness
 certain
 things
 in
 life


that
 are
 so
 intense,


they
 alter
 you.
 They
 change
 you.
 They


change
 what
 you
 value.
 They
 change
 what


what
 you
 make
 important
 in
 your
 life.


And
 so
 what
 I
 say
 to
 people,
 you
 want


your
 life
 to
 keep
 growing.
 Keep
 putting


yourself
 in
 new
 environments.
 Keep


getting
 around
 things
 you're
 not
 used
 to


and
 let
 something
 hit
 you.
 You
 know,


people
 don't
 know
 their
 passions
 cuz


they
 keep
 going
 doing
 the
 same
 things.


It's
 like
 get
 around
 where
 it's
 better


and
 see
 what
 hits
 you
 and
 something's


going
 to
 strike
 you.
 Something's
 going


to
 wake
 you
 up.
 Something
 is
 going
 to


make
 you
 feel
 more,
 desire
 more,
 want
 to


give
 something
 to
 life
 as
 opposed
 to


just
 live
 your
 life
 because
 the
 life
 you


describe
 to
 those
 people
 is
 predictable.


You
 get
 familiarized.
 Even
 pain,
 I
 mean,


you
 look
 at
 people
 in
 Ashwitz,
 you
 know,


um,
 Man's
 Search
 for
 Meaning
 is
 one
 of


my
 favorite
 books.
 Have
 you
 read
 it?


>> Victor
 Frank.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 I
 bought
 the
 rights
 of


making
 the
 movie,
 right?
 Oh,
 really?


>> Oh,
 the
 reason
 I
 was
 telling
 you
 about


the
 the
 Finding
 the
 Kids
 is
 I
 made
 The


Sound
 of
 Freedom.
 Did
 you
 see
 it?


>> Yes.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 and
 we
 beat
 Disney
 that
 week


and
 people
 thought
 that
 it
 would
 never


happen,
 right?
 But
 that
 movie
 changed


people
 radically,
 woke
 them
 up,
 brought


resources
 to
 the
 table,
 has
 created
 real


shift.
 Man's
 search
 to
 meaning
 I
 think


can
 do
 that
 as
 well.
 But
 in
 those


places,
 they
 get
 habituated
 to
 the
 pain.


You
 get
 habituated
 pain
 or
 pleasure.


That's
 why
 we've
 got
 to
 grow.
 And
 when


we
 grow,
 we
 get
 that
 life
 cycle.
 We
 feel


more
 alive
 and
 then
 we
 got
 something
 to


share.
 And
 then
 we
 feel
 meaning
 and
 then


it's
 like
 a
 virtuous
 cycle
 and
 life
 gets


better
 and
 better.


>> Last
 month
 I
 told
 you
 about
 our
 sponsor


Function
 Health
 and
 their
 team
 who've


developed
 a
 way
 of
 giving
 you
 a
 full
 360


view
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 inside
 your


body.
 They
 offer
 over
 100
 advanced
 lab


tests
 covering
 everything
 from
 hormones,


toxins,
 inflammation,
 heart
 health,


stress,
 and
 so
 much
 more.
 So
 Jack,
 who


started
 this
 show
 with
 me,
 got
 his
 first


blood
 draw
 done
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks
 ago.


So
 I
 thought
 I'd
 let
 him
 tell
 you
 a


little
 bit
 more
 about
 his
 experience.


This
 test
 really
 opened
 my
 eyes
 to


personally
 what
 I
 should
 be
 doing
 with


my
 health.
 I
 hear
 a
 lot
 of
 information


in
 this
 podcast.
 I
 sit
 in
 every
 single


recording.
 So
 to
 know
 how
 I
 can
 relate


each
 one
 to
 me
 personally
 is
 super


valuable.
 You
 sign
 up
 and
 you
 schedule


your
 tests
 and
 once
 you're
 done
 you
 get


a
 little
 report
 like
 the
 one
 I
 have


here.
 I
 can
 see
 my
 inrange
 results,
 my


out
 of
 range
 results,
 and
 there's
 a


little
 AI
 function
 too.
 So
 if
 I
 have
 any


questions
 about
 my
 out
 of
 range
 results,


I
 can
 just
 go
 in
 there
 and
 ask
 it
 any


question
 I
 want.
 And
 these
 tests
 are


backed
 by
 doctors
 and
 thousands
 of
 hours


of
 research.
 You
 get
 an
 annual
 draw
 done


and
 a
 mid-year
 follow-up.
 So,
 if
 you


want
 to
 learn
 more,
 head
 over
 to


functionhealth.com/doac


where
 you
 can
 sign
 up
 for
 a

 a
 year.


I'll
 put
 the
 link
 in
 the
 description


below.
 It
 is
 just
 $1
 a
 day
 for
 your


health.
 You
 know,
 every
 once
 in
 a
 while


you
 come
 across
 a
 product
 that
 has
 such


a
 huge
 impact
 on
 your
 life
 that
 you'd


probably
 describe
 as
 a
 gamecher.
 And
 I


would
 say
 for
 about
 35
 to
 40%
 of
 my


team,
 they
 would
 currently
 describe
 this


product
 that
 I
 have
 in
 front
 of
 me


called
 Ketone
 IQ,
 which
 you
 can
 get
 at


ketone.com


as
 a
 game
 changer.
 But
 the
 reason
 I


became
 a
 co-owner
 of
 this
 company
 and


the
 reason
 why
 they
 they
 now
 are
 a


sponsor
 of
 this
 podcast
 is
 because
 one


day
 when
 I
 came
 to
 work,
 there
 was
 a
 box


of
 this
 stuff
 sat
 on
 my
 desk.
 I
 had
 no


idea
 what
 it
 was.
 Lily
 and
 my
 team
 says


that
 this
 company
 have
 been
 in
 touch.
 So


I
 went
 upstairs,
 tried
 it,
 and
 quite


frankly,
 the
 rest
 is
 history.
 in
 terms


of
 my
 focus,
 my
 energy
 levels,
 how
 I


feel,
 how
 I
 work,
 how
 productive
 I
 am.


Game
 changer.
 So,
 if
 you

 to
 give
 it


a
 try,

 You'll
 also
 get
 a
 free

with
 your
 second

 And
 now
 you


can
 find
 Keton
 IQ
 at
 Target
 stores


across
 the
 United
 States
 where
 your


first
 shot
 is
 completely
 free
 of
 charge.


I
 was
 stunned
 at
 how
 big
 your
 business


empire
 is.
 You
 know,
 even
 as
 you're


speaking
 there,
 you're
 talking
 about


movies
 that
 I've
 watched
 that
 I
 had
 no


idea
 that
 you're
 involved
 in.
 And
 you're


talking
 about
 all
 these
 other
 incredible


things
 you've
 done.
 And
 yeah,
 your


company's
 doing
 what
 what
 12
 billion


dollars
 in
 revenue
 annually.


>> Well,
 it's
 a
 group
 of
 companies,
 not


just


>> group
 of
 companies.
 Yeah.
 And
 then


earlier
 on,
 you
 said
 you'd
 spoken
 to


these
 50
 very,
 very
 rich
 people
 in
 the


pursuit
 of
 writing
 the
 books
 that
 you've


written
 about
 wealth
 and
 finance
 and


money.


Pattern
 recognition.


>> That's
 right.


>> What
 is
 the
 pattern
 that
 you
 noticed
 in


those
 people
 that
 you
 then
 applied
 to


yourself?
 What
 is
 the
 pattern?
 You
 know,


this
 is
 called
 the
 diary
 of
 a
 CEO.
 So,


I'm
 sure
 we
 have
 a
 lot of
 people
 that


are
 thinking
 about
 building
 businesses,


want
 to
 get
 financially
 free,
 especially


in
 a
 world
 of
 AI
 where
 they're
 they're


very
 uncertain
 about
 how
 they'll
 make


money
 and
 how
 they'll
 provide
 stability


that
 to
 their
 family.
 What
 is
 the


pattern
 that
 you
 have
 found
 in
 all
 of


those
 people
 that
 you
 have
 met
 and


interviewed
 and
 I
 know
 you
 know
 some
 of


the
 most
 wealthy
 people
 on
 earth
 because


I
 know
 you
 coach
 a
 lot
 of
 them.
 Um,
 I


don't
 think
 people
 fully
 realize
 the


significance
 of
 how
 many
 of
 the
 most


influential
 people
 on
 planet
 earth
 you


have
 worked
 with
 and
 continue
 to
 work


with.
 Um,
 I
 found
 it
 hilarious
 reading


that
 Bill
 Clinton
 called
 you
 uh
 the
 day


before
 he
 was
 going
 to
 be
 impeached


telling
 you
 that
 he
 was
 going
 to
 be


impeached
 and
 asking
 you
 what
 he
 should


do.


>> Yeah.
 First,
 let's
 say
 what
 everybody


makes
 the
 mistake
 on
 the
 majority
 of


people.
 We
 live
 in
 a
 free
 enterprise


system
 and
 we
 have
 kids
 that
 all
 think


communism
 is
 great.
 I
 just
 want
 you
 to


know
 I
 went
 to
 the
 USSR
 when
 it
 was


still
 the
 USSR.
 I
 was
 24
 years
 old.
 I


was
 brought
 there
 because
 of
 my


firewalking
 experience.
 And
 I
 went
 on
 a


train
 from
 from
 Moscow
 to
 Siberia
 and


back
 for
 two
 weeks.
 On
 the
 train,
 we


were
 all
 fed
 caviar
 and
 the
 most


incredible
 meals
 as
 were
 all
 the


Russians
 on
 the
 plane,
 right?
 We're


supposed
 to
 be
 all
 equal,
 right?
 That's


supposedly
 what
 communism
 is.
 It's


everything's
 fair
 for
 everybody.
 Every


single
 town,
 we'd
 stop
 in
 the
 square


where
 the
 there
 and
 in
 the
 square


there's
 a
 big
 building
 and
 they
 wrapped


around
 for
 about
 maybe
 a
 quarter
 of
 a


mile.
 people
 standing
 in
 the
 freezing


cold
 to
 get
 a
 quart
 of
 milk
 and
 a
 half
 a


thing
 of
 bread.
 I
 left
 there
 and
 I


became
 a
 capitalist.
 I
 didn't
 know
 what


a
 capitalist
 was,
 but
 I
 knew
 I
 wasn't
 a


communist.
 Right?
 So,
 people
 in
 our


country
 are
 the
 free
 enterprise
 system,


but
 they
 don't
 understand
 it.
 So,
 what


are
 they
 making
 the
 mistake
 of?
 They're


consumers.
 They're
 not
 owners.
 We
 are
 a


consumer
 society
 and
 we
 train
 these
 kids


to
 be
 consumers.
 Adults
 as
 well.
 So,


I'll
 give
 you a
 simple
 example.
 I
 looked


I
 was
 trying
 to
 give
 an
 example
 to
 a


young
 kid
 the
 other
 day,
 so
 I
 actually


did
 the
 math
 on
 it.
 You
 have
 an
 iPhone?


Yeah.


>> Okay.
 Have
 you
 always
 had
 an
 iPhone?


>> Well,
 yeah.
 For
 the
 last
 decade
 or
 more.


Yeah.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 iPhones
 around
 for
 what,


18
 years,
 19
 years.
 I
 went
 and
 did
 the


numbers
 and
 found
 out
 what
 the
 cost
 was


for
 every
 iPhone.
 Add
 it
 up.
 If
 you
 got


an
 iPhone
 each
 time,
 somebody
 who's


older
 to
 do
 it,
 you
 spent
 22,000
 and


some
 change
 at
 the
 retail
 price.
 If
 you


bought
 the
 stock,
 I
 went
 and
 saw
 what


the
 stock
 was
 on
 the
 same
 day
 the
 thing


came
 out
 and
 you
 bought
 the
 stock.
 Same


amount
 of
 money
 of
 the
 stock.


>> Apple
 stock.


>> Apple
 stock.
 $326,000
 right
 now.
 Instead


of
 out
 22
 grand,
 you
 have
 326.
 If
 you're


going
 to
 use
 an
 Apple
 phone,
 I'm
 not


saying
 it's
 Apple
 specifically.
 I'm
 not


making
 a
 recommendation.
 Why
 would
 you


not
 own
 the
 company,
 right?
 Because
 we


don't
 teach
 people
 to
 think
 that
 way.


And
 so
 now
 they
 think
 communism
 is
 going


to
 be
 the
 answer.
 They
 don't
 understand


what
 that
 really
 means.
 They
 have
 no


clue.
 So
 you
 have
 to
 become
 an
 owner.


You
 have
 that's
 what
 you
 have
 to
 do.


Then
 the
 second
 piece
 is
 when
 I


interviewed
 all
 these
 people,
 I
 found


four
 things
 with
 them.
 I
 found
 number


one
 their
 focus
 didn't
 matter
 if
 they're


a
 macro
 trader
 or
 if
 they
 were
 value


trader
 or
 it
 didn't
 matter
 what
 their


style
 was
 the
 four
 things
 that
 had
 in


common
 I
 call
 them
 the
 core
 four
 was


number
 one
 they
 all
 were
 focused
 on
 not


losing
 money
 most
 people
 are
 trying
 to


make
 money
 and
 the
 reason
 is
 they
 know


if
 you
 lose
 you
 know
 you
 you
 lose
 you


got
 a
 $100,000
 investment
 and
 you
 lose


50%


how
 much
 do
 you
 have
 to
 grow
 your
 money


to
 get
 your
 money
 back
 and
 people
 will


say
 50%
 %.
 No,
 you
 got
 to
 grow
 at
 100%.


>> Right?
 You
 get
 it?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Right.
 So,
 they
 know
 that.
 So,
 they're


first
 making
 sure
 they
 don't.
 Now,
 how


do
 they
 do
 that?
 They
 do
 it
 by
 asset


allocation,
 right?
 They
 all
 have


different
 asset
 allocation
 strategies,


which
 at
 the
 most
 basic
 level
 is
 you


don't
 put
 all
 your
 eggs
 in
 one
 basket.


Most
 people
 put
 all
 their
 money
 in
 their


business
 or
 their
 house,
 right?
 They


know
 that
 that
 is
 the
 kiss
 of
 death.
 And


so
 they
 look
 at
 how
 to
 divide
 their


assets
 where
 they
 have
 a
 certain
 amount


in
 a
 more
 secure
 environment,
 meaning


not
 a
 lot
 of
 upside,
 but
 it's
 like
 the


nest
 egg.
 And
 they
 have
 some
 that
 are


more
 at
 risk.
 And
 there's
 different
 and


I
 learned
 what
 theirs
 are
 and
 I
 taught


those
 different
 ones.
 But
 the
 most


valuable
 one
 I
 know,
 you
 know,
 because
 I


read
 it
 in
 your
 book
 and
 I
 was
 really


impressed.
 Asymmetrical
 riskreward.


Their
 entire
 focus
 is
 not
 about
 taking


risks,
 right?
 There
 are
 few
 only
 a
 few


people.
 You
 think
 you're
 a
 billionaire


because
 you
 took
 giant
 risks,
 right?
 No,


no,
 no.
 may
 have
 some
 do,
 but
 they
 don't


usually
 stay
 billionaires
 doing
 that,


right?


>> How
 do
 they
 do
 it?
 They
 figure
 out


what's
 the
 smallest
 amount
 of
 risk
 with


the
 most
 amount
 of
 upside
 that
 I
 can
 do.


And
 so
 Paul
 Tudtor
 Jones's
 approach
 was


5
 to
 one.
 If
 I'm
 going
 to
 risk
 a
 dollar,


I
 want
 to
 be
 certain
 I
 can
 make
 five.


You
 and
 I,
 most
 average
 people
 would


normally
 think,
 I
 used
 to
 think,
 well,


12,
 15,
 20%
 return,
 right?
 But
 here's


how
 it
 works.
 If
 I
 risk
 $1
 and
 I'm


certain
 I
 make
 five,
 and
 I'm
 wrong.
 I'm


down
 one.
 I
 can
 risk
 a
 dollar
 and
 still


make
 four.
 I
 can
 be
 wrong
 four
 times
 out


of
 five
 and
 still
 be
 okay.
 That's
 how


those
 guys
 become
 billionaires.


Asymmetrical
 reward.
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 a


gentleman
 um
 who
 in
 19
 2008,
 excuse
 me.


He
 took
 $25
 million
 and
 turned
 into
 $2


billion
 in
 the
 worst
 economic
 time.
 He


anticipated
 what
 was
 going
 to
 happen


with
 real
 estate.
 Everybody
 thought
 it


was
 going
 to
 keep
 going
 up.
 He
 used


synthetic
 bets
 and
 bet
 against
 it.
 Made


$2
 billion.
 Brilliant.
 Brilliant
 job.


And
 I
 said
 to
 him,
 you
 know
 what?
 What


is
 the
 things
 that's
 missing
 for


investors?
 He
 goes,
 well,
 the
 smartest


investors
 are
 usually
 the
 worst


investors
 because
 they
 want
 absolute


certainty.
 They
 know
 everything
 before


they
 decide.
 And
 by
 that
 time,
 the


opportunity
 is
 gone.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 he
 said,
 but
 the
 most
 important
 key


for
 him
 was
 asymmetrical
 riskreward.
 He


said,
 I
 risked,
 I
 think
 he
 said
 he


risked
 six
 cents
 for
 every
 dollar.
 He


could
 have
 been
 wrong
 a
 dozen
 times,
 but


he
 wasn't.
 That's
 how
 he
 did
 it,
 right?


And
 then
 the
 fourth
 one
 is
 the
 obvious


one
 we
 both
 know
 which
 is


diversification.
 But
 this
 is
 the
 real


key.
 You
 know
 Ray
 Dalz,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I've
 interviewed
 him


actually.


>> Yeah.
 So
 Ray's
 a
 good
 friend.
 One
 of
 the


questions
 I
 asked
 him
 was
 if
 we
 had
 to


reduce
 it
 to
 the
 single
 most
 important


investment
 principle
 to
 know.
 I
 mean


you're
 the
 Da
 Vinci
 of
 investing.
 No
 one


has
 made
 more
 money
 than
 you
 in
 this


area.
 You
 know
 I
 said
 what
 is
 it?
 Is


there
 one?
 There's
 got
 to
 be
 one.
 And
 he


goes
 Tony
 there
 is.
 He
 goes,
 "I
 spent


almost
 nine
 years
 refining
 this
 and
 it's


so
 simple.
 It's
 the
 holy
 grail
 of


investing
 is
 to
 find
 8
 to
 12


uncorrelated
 investments
 that
 you
 feel


strongly
 about.
 If
 you
 find
 8
 to
 12
 of


those,
 you
 reduce
 your
 risk
 80%
 and
 keep


your
 upside.
 In
 fact,
 you
 slightly


enhance
 your
 upside.


>> Uncorrelated
 for
 someone


>> uncorrelated.
 That's
 that's
 the
 hard


part
 today
 because
 so
 many
 markets
 are


correlated.


>> What
 does
 uncorrelated
 mean
 for
 someone


that
 does?"
 Well,
 for
 example,
 stocks


and
 bonds
 traditionally
 are
 thought
 of


as
 uncorrelated.
 Meaning,
 you
 know,


stocks
 in
 a
 tough
 time,
 those
 are
 the


excuse
 me,
 in
 a
 growing
 time,
 stocks
 are


where
 you
 put
 your
 money,
 but
 bonds
 are


to
 protect
 you
 when
 the
 market
 goes


down.
 Unfortunately,
 doing
 most
 things


like
 2008
 or
 2020,
 they
 both
 go
 down
 at


that
 time,
 but
 nobody
 talks
 about
 that.


They
 just
 go, "Oh,
 it's
 this
 weird


thing.
 It
 happens
 regularly."


>> So,
 things
 that
 don't
 move
 together.


>> That's
 right.
 They
 don't
 move
 together.


Well,
 so
 much
 is
 tied
 together
 today.


But
 the
 only
 way
 to
 really
 do
 it
 is


you've
 got
 to
 have
 private
 investment.


private
 equity,
 private
 credit,
 private


real
 estate.
 You
 have
 to
 diversify


beyond
 just
 stocks
 and
 bonds.
 And
 then


you
 can
 get
 that
 across
 it
 by
 different


industries,
 different
 elements.
 Because


think
 about
 this,
 this
 will
 blow
 your


mind.
 Private
 equity,
 basic
 private


equity,
 not
 I
 interviewed
 12
 of
 the
 best


in
 the
 world.
 Basic
 private
 equity
 has


outproduced
 every
 stock
 market
 in
 the


world
 for
 40
 years.
 Every
 single
 stock


market
 in
 the
 world
 every
 year
 for
 40


years.
 Now,
 you
 don't
 have
 total


liquidity.
 That's
 you're
 giving


something
 up,
 but
 your
 returns
 are
 in
 a


different
 place.
 They
 don't
 have
 to
 sell


when
 things
 are
 tough.
 They
 take


advantage.
 These
 are
 the
 smartest
 people


out
 there.
 They're
 not
 just
 trying
 to


get
 alpha.
 They're
 building
 value,


right?
 They
 take
 a
 company,
 they
 put
 AI


in
 it,
 they
 bring
 new
 people
 to
 it,
 and


then
 they
 take
 it
 to
 the
 public
 or
 in


most
 cases,
 they
 sell
 it
 to
 private


companies.
 There's
 fewer
 public


companies
 than
 ever.
 So,
 I
 looked
 it
 up


and
 it
 was
 f fantastic
 seed.
 The
 average


S&P
 for
 39
 years
 was
 9%.
 Nice
 return.
 If


you
 put
 a
 million
 dollars
 down,
 you


know,
 you'd
 have
 $28
 million,
 you
 know,


39
 years
 later
 without
 doing
 anything.


But
 if
 you
 put
 it
 in
 basic
 private


equity,
 basic
 private
 equity
 is
 average


15.7%.


Think
 about
 the
 difference
 of


compounding
 that
 every
 single
 year.


>> That's
 crazy.


>> Now
 it's
 worth
 $328
 million.


That's
 the
 difference
 between
 the
 same


investment
 in
 public
 versus
 private.
 So


it's
 finding
 these
 pieces.
 But
 when
 you


can
 do
 8
 to
 12
 uncorrelated
 investments


or
 more,
 reduce
 your
 risk
 by
 80%.
 That's


how
 you
 get
 higher
 returns
 and
 the
 same


time
 because
 most
 people
 are
 behind.
 And


so


>> you
 didn't
 come
 from
 a
 financial


background.


>> No.
 No.
 I
 have
 no
 financial
 background.


>> You
 didn't
 study
 finance
 in
 university?


>> No.


>> So,
 so
 where
 did
 you
 learn
 all
 this


stuff
 about
 finance?


>> By
 going
 to
 the
 very
 best
 on
 earth.
 Like


why
 would
 I
 go
 to
 university
 to
 a


professor
 who's
 never
 done
 anything
 when


I
 can
 go
 to
 50
 of
 the
 smartest
 people
 on


earth
 or
 in
 private
 equity?
 I
 went
 to
 13


of
 the
 smartest
 ones,
 most
 successful
 in


history.
 Is
 your
 superpower
 learning?


>> Yes.
 I
 think
 it's
 that's
 what
 I
 tried
 to


say
 to
 you
 from
 the
 beginning.
 That's


what
 pattern
 recognition,
 pattern


utilization,
 pattern
 creation
 is.
 If
 you


don't
 learn
 at
 a
 rapid
 tempo
 in
 the


world
 right
 now,
 you're
 cheating


yourself
 of
 an
 extraordinary
 life.


>> Is
 there
 a
 tactic
 or
 a
 strategy
 to
 make


me
 a
 better
 learner?
 Especially
 someone


that
 does
 this
 pockets.
 I
 get
 to
 meet


people
 like
 you.
 So,
 I
 want
 to
 store


everything.
 Yes.
 In
 this
 time
 that
 we


have.


>> Yes.
 I
 I'm
 I
 believe
 in
 immersion
 and


space
 repetition.
 So,
 I
 believe
 like
 did


did
 you
 take
 a
 language
 in
 school?


>> Oh,
 god.
 Yeah.
 German.
 Can
 you
 speak
 it?


>> Nine.


>> That's
 right.
 So,
 most
 people
 go
 to


college
 or
 high
 school
 and
 college
 and


they
 take
 a
 language,
 right?
 And
 five


years
 later,
 10
 years
 later,
 can't
 speak


a
 word,
 right?
 Immersion
 is
 how
 you
 do


it.
 So,
 if
 I
 wanted
 to
 teach
 you
 a


language
 and
 you
 had
 the
 time
 and
 money,


I
 would
 take
 you
 to
 Italy
 and
 I
 would


drop
 you
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 Rome
 and
 say,


"I'll
 see
 you
 in
 90
 days."
 With
 no
 one


to
 teach
 you
 in
 90
 days,
 are
 you
 going


to
 be
 speaking
 the
 language?


>> Better.


>> Yeah.


>> You're
 going
 to
 speak
 the
 language.


You're
 going
 to
 know
 the
 nuances
 of
 the


language.
 you're
 going to
 have
 a
 pitch


and
 tone
 that's
 more
 there
 because
 it's


how
 you
 learned
 originally
 by
 total


immersion.
 So
 the
 reason
 I
 do
 12
 hours
 a


day
 for
 4
 days,
 50
 hours
 in
 a
 weekend
 or


60
 hours
 and
 most
 people
 think
 I'll


never
 do
 that,
 but
 they're
 having
 the


time
 of
 their
 life.
 So
 time
 disappears


when
 you're
 enjoying
 yourself
 and
 you


hate
 it.
 I
 mean
 it
 feels
 like
 eternity.


But
 the
 reason
 I'm
 able
 to
 do
 that
 is


that
 immersion
 is
 like
 years
 of


experience
 and
 you're
 in
 a
 peak
 state


while
 you're
 doing
 it.
 So
 you
 remember


it
 because
 it's
 locked
 in
 like
 911
 as


opposed
 to
 811.
 So,
 I
 love
 that.
 The


other
 thing
 that
 I
 do
 is
 I'm
 capturing


and
 I
 use
 AI
 now
 to
 do
 it.
 I've
 kept


journals
 my
 whole
 life
 just
 like
 you


looks
 like
 you've
 done,
 but
 I'm
 building


on
 it,
 but
 I
 have
 my
 AI
 that
 I've
 been


feeding
 over
 and
 over
 and
 over
 again
 the


things
 I
 wanted
 to
 remember,
 the


principles,
 and
 I
 create
 structures
 to


evaluate
 these
 things.


>> And
 I
 asked
 you
 there
 about
 how
 these


wealthy
 investors
 make
 their
 money.
 Um,


the
 the
 last
 question
 I
 really
 have


around
 this
 is
 how
 the
 best


entrepreneurs
 in
 the
 world
 make
 their


money.
 Um,
 again,
 we're
 called
 the
 diary


of
 a
 CEO.
 So,
 there's
 lots
 of


entrepreneurs
 and
 build
 business


builders
 watching.
 And
 I
 know
 you've


worked
 with
 many
 of
 the
 world's
 top


entrepreneurs.
 In
 fact,
 one
 of
 them


wrote
 you
 a
 letter.


>> Oh,
 which
 one?


>> Mark
 Ben
 off.


>> Oh,
 I
 love
 Mark.
 He's
 a
 beautiful
 man.


>> For
 anyone
 that
 doesn't
 know
 who
 Mark


is.
 Um,
 he's
 the
 the
 founder
 CEO
 of


Salesforce.


>> Yes.
 Yeah.
 He
 actually
 came
 to
 four,
 I


think,
 or
 five
 of
 my
 seminars
 originally


in
 a
 row,
 same
 seminar.
 And
 uh,
 you


know,
 Mark's
 as
 big
 as
 I
 am.
 He's
 a
 big


guy
 and
 he
 was
 going
 for
 it
 full
 tilt.


And
 finally
 after
 the
 fourth
 one,
 he


came
 up
 to
 me
 and
 said,
 "You've


convinced
 me.
 I'm
 going
 to
 leave
 Oracle.


I'm
 going
 to
 start
 my
 own
 business.
 I


want
 you
 to
 come
 on
 the
 journey
 with
 me.


It's
 called
 Salesforce.com."
 He
 said,


"We're
 going
 to
 change
 business
 around


the
 world."
 And
 he
 said
 this
 to
 me.
 He


goes,
 "And
 I
 promise
 you,
 we'll
 get
 to
 a


hundred
 million
 dollars
 in
 business."


Now
 he's
 doing
 like
 42
 billion,
 right?


So,
 but
 Mark's
 what
 I
 love
 about
 Mark
 is


he's
 a
 contributor.
 He's
 he's
 a
 social


CEO.
 Like
 he
 does
 things
 for
 society.
 He


isn't
 just
 about
 himself.
 He's
 an


extraordinary
 human
 being.
 He
 said,


"Dear
 Tony,
 I
 am
 so
 deeply
 grateful
 for


everything
 that
 you've
 done
 for
 me
 over


the
 last
 four
 decades."
 He
 talked
 about


the
 seminars
 he'd
 been
 to
 with
 you
 and


says
 that
 you've
 transformed
 his
 life


through
 your
 inspiration
 and
 ideas.
 He


talks
 about
 that
 particular
 seminar
 you


referenced
 as
 the
 moment
 that
 led
 him
 to


go
 deeper
 and
 deeper
 and
 deeper.
 He
 said


it
 was
 at
 date
 with
 Destiny
 that
 I
 made


the
 firm
 decision
 to
 leave
 Oracle
 and


start
 my
 own
 company.
 We
 even
 had
 a


brief
 conversation
 about
 it
 back
 then.


If
 you
 remember,


>> I
 remember.


>> Fast
 forward
 26
 years
 and
 Salesforce
 now


has
 80,000
 employees
 and
 generates
 over


40
 billion
 in
 revenue
 annually.
 It


stands
 as
 the
 largest
 enterprise


software
 company
 in
 the
 world.
 I
 truly


could
 not
 have
 done
 it
 without
 you
 by
 my


side.
 And
 as
 you
 always
 say,
 we
 often


overestimate
 what
 we
 can
 do
 in
 one
 year,


but
 we
 vastly
 underestimate
 what
 we
 can


do
 in
 a
 few
 decades.
 Tony,
 I
 started


this
 letter
 with
 gratitude.
 And
 I'll
 end


it
 the
 same
 way.
 When
 I
 reached
 my
 most


difficult
 moments,
 you
 were
 there.
 When


I
 reached
 my
 highest
 heights,
 you
 were


also
 there.
 I
 never
 forgot
 that
 whenever


I
 reached
 out
 for
 help,
 you
 returned
 the


phone
 call
 or
 text,
 always
 quickly.


Business
 and
 politics
 are
 temporal,
 but


relationships
 are
 eternal,
 and
 yours
 is


one
 I
 carry
 with
 me
 always.


Congratulations
 on
 everything
 you're


doing.
 I
 look
 forward
 to
 a
 wonderful


future
 with
 you.
 Aloha,
 Mark.
 That's


very
 beautiful.


It
 makes
 me
 a
 little
 emotional,
 but
 I


just
 I
 love
 Mark.
 He's
 such
 a
 good
 man


and


um
 I
 was
 very
 kind
 of
 him
 to
 write
 that


letter.
 He
 says
 he
 gives
 me
 more
 credit


than
 I
 deserve.
 Um
 but
 I
 I
 love
 him


personally.
 I
 love
 I
 I
 love
 strangers.


I'm
 driven
 by
 that.
 But
 I
 love
 Mark


because
 he's
 such
 a
 giver.
 I
 I
 see
 him


as
 a
 a
 role
 model
 of
 what
 a
 great
 CEO


is.
 Someone
 who
 understands
 the
 social


impact
 of
 what
 they're
 doing
 as
 well
 as


the
 business
 impact.
 Um,
 he's
 got
 a


heart
 of
 gold
 and
 of
 course
 we
 all
 have


ups
 and
 downs
 throughout
 our
 lives
 and


and
 he
 thinks
 he's
 just
 I've
 just
 helped


him,
 he's
 helped
 me,
 too.
 It's
 like
 it's


never
 a
 one
 one
 way
 piece.
 It's
 not
 like


I
 go
 around
 and
 coach
 all
 these
 people.


I'm
 no
 idiot.
 I've
 learned
 so
 much
 from


Mark.
 Uh,
 it's
 priceless.
 So,
 I
 have
 to


I
 have
 to
 send
 that
 thanks
 right
 back
 to


him.
 No
 question
 about
 it.


>> Where
 does
 that
 emotion
 come
 from
 that
 I


see
 in
 your
 face?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I
 was
 just
 like


I'm
 I'm
 an
 emotional
 guy.
 I'm
 empathetic


guy
 and
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 lover,
 you
 know?


That's
 what
 drives
 all
 that
 I
 do.
 And
 to


um
 see
 somebody
 I
 love
 and
 to
 see
 how


far
 he's
 come
 and
 to
 know
 that
 um
 I've


been
 able
 to
 be
 helpful
 to
 him
 at
 at
 key


moments
 um
 is
 meaningful.
 You
 know,
 it's


extremely
 meaningful
 cuz
 he's
 provided


opportunities
 for
 millions
 of
 people,


80,000
 employees,
 but
 millions
 of
 people


through
 his
 creativity
 and
 his
 focus.


And
 we've
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 cool
 things


together.
 I
 called
 him
 one
 time.
 I
 was


up
 in
 uh
 San
 Francisco
 for
 other


business.
 And
 um
 I
 read
 in
 the
 paper


that
 this
 this
 landlord
 was
 kicking
 out


these
 nuns
 who
 had
 the
 food
 kitchen
 in


the
 the
 worst
 part
 of
 the
 city
 there
 in


the
 Tenderloin
 district.
 And
 I
 was
 like,


"This
 guy's
 an
 idiot.
 I
 mean,
 I
 got
 to
 I


got
 to
 do
 something."
 So
 instead
 of


leaving,
 I
 spent
 an
 extra
 day
 and
 I
 went


and
 met
 these
 nuns,
 most
 incredible


ladies.
 And
 they
 were
 spending
 all
 their


time
 cooking
 food
 so
 they
 could
 sell


food
 so
 they
 could
 make
 money
 so
 they


could
 actually
 prepare
 food
 for
 the


homeless
 there.
 and
 in
 this
 tiny
 little


building
 and
 they
 were
 getting
 kicked


out.
 So
 I
 called
 the
 owner
 and
 I
 said


listen
 I'm
 own
 a
 lot
 of
 real
 estate


also.
 I
 understand
 your
 rights
 as
 a
 real


estate
 guy
 but
 I
 said
 do
 you
 want
 to
 be


the
 most
 hated
 guy
 in
 San
 Francisco?
 I


said
 I'll
 give
 you
 an
 option.
 How
 about


let
 them
 stay
 to
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.


I'll
 pay
 their
 lease.
 I'll
 pay
 twice
 the


amount
 and
 then
 I'll
 get
 them
 out.
 I


said
 but
 you
 don't
 push
 them
 out
 now
 on


the
 street.
 So
 we
 agreed.
 And
 so
 then
 I


said
 to
 ladies,
 "Let's
 find
 a
 place
 for


you
 and
 I'll
 help
 you
 find
 a
 place.


We'll
 rent
 a
 place
 for
 you."
 And
 then
 I


started
 getting
 phone
 calls
 and
 one
 of


the
 phone
 calls
 I
 got
 says
 realtor
 and


he
 goes
 they're
 they're
 looking
 to
 buy
 a


place
 and
 I
 said
 I
 said
 well
 where
 are


they
 getting
 the
 money?
 I
 said
 they
 said


I
 don't
 know.
 So
 I
 called
 and
 made
 none


up
 and
 she
 goes
 uh
 I
 said
 you
 know
 I
 I


was
 said
 I'd
 you
 know
 pay
 for
 a
 place


for
 you
 guys
 for
 a
 year
 you
 know
 lease


you
 a
 place.
 I
 said
 but
 I
 hear
 you're


looking
 to
 buy
 a
 place.
 Do
 you
 guys
 have


some
 capital
 I'm
 not
 aware
 of?
 And
 she


goes
 no.
 She
 goes
 will
 provide
 Tony


like
 God
 will
 provide.
 So,
 so
 I
 spent,
 I


don't
 know,
 a
 million
 two
 or
 something


like
 that
 to
 find
 them
 a
 place.
 But
 then


I
 called
 Mark
 because
 I
 didn't
 want
 them


living
 in
 the
 place.
 I
 said,
 "Mark,


match
 me
 on
 this."
 And
 I
 mean,
 he
 didn't


hesitate
 a
 second.
 He
 had
 not
 even
 met


the
 nuns.
 Then
 he
 went
 the
 nuns,
 we
 went


met
 them,
 and
 he
 went
 and
 he
 bought
 them


a
 home
 for
 them
 to
 stay
 in.
 And
 and
 then


we
 went
 through
 four
 years
 of
 the
 city


trying
 to
 not
 let
 them
 take
 over
 this


place.
 But
 that's
 the
 kind
 of
 guy
 Mark


is.
 So,
 he's
 incredibly
 generous
 and
 I'm


very
 touched
 that
 I
 could
 count
 him
 as
 a


friend
 and
 be
 a
 helpful
 to
 him.
 and


you've
 been
 so
 helpful
 to
 me.


>> I've
 learned
 quite
 a
 lot
 about
 you
 today


just
 from
 observing
 you
 and
 two
 one
 of


the
 big
 things
 that
 I've
 learned
 is
 the


two
 moments
 where
 I've
 seen
 tears
 in


your
 eyes


>> have
 both
 been
 moments
 where
 people
 have


expressed
 a
 huge
 amount
 of
 love
 and


appreciation
 for
 you.


>> That's
 true.


>> And
 I
 I
 work
 back
 through
 your
 early


earliest
 years
 and
 I
 again
 it's
 almost


like
 a
 a
 jigsaw
 puzzle
 coming
 into


formation
 in
 my
 mind
 of
 how
 how
 much
 you


love
 love.


>> I
 do.
 I
 think
 love
 is
 life.
 Love
 is
 the


driving
 force
 in
 my
 life
 for
 sure.


There's
 no
 question
 about
 it.
 And
 that's


why
 I
 can't
 I
 I
 hate
 to
 see
 suffering


because
 it's
 the
 opposite
 of
 love.
 You


know,
 if
 you
 love
 somebody,
 what
 do
 you


do?
 Anything
 you
 can.
 So
 that's
 what
 I'm


called
 to
 do.
 And
 it
 is
 it's
 a
 calling.


It's
 not
 a
 job.
 It's
 not
 a
 business.
 You


I
 have
 all
 kinds
 of
 businesses
 obviously


and
 I
 enjoy
 business.
 But
 this
 is
 my


mission.
 This
 is
 what
 I'm
 made
 for.
 And


um
 I'm
 just
 one
 guy.
 I
 can't
 do


everything,
 but
 I
 can
 do
 a
 lot.
 And
 I'm


always
 figuring
 how
 to
 scale
 more,


right?
 you
 know,
 whether
 it's
 feeding


people
 or
 I'm
 getting,
 you
 know,
 my
 wife


and
 I,
 we
 were
 fortunate
 enough
 to
 have


our
 own
 plane
 and
 I
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 just


burn
 up
 a
 bunch
 of
 carbon.
 I
 found
 it's


3,000
 trees.
 I
 said,
 let's
 plant
 a
 100


million
 trees.
 So,
 we're
 up
 to
 75


million.
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 hit
 the


100
 million
 this
 year.
 And
 but
 we
 didn't


just
 plant
 the
 trees.
 We
 talked
 to


farmers,
 work
 with
 an
 organization
 about


how
 to
 build
 a
 build
 a
 crop
 not
 once
 a


year,
 but
 to
 do
 it
 across
 12
 different


months
 so
 that
 if
 something
 drops,
 they


come
 out
 and
 they
 go
 from
 earning
 a
 $125


a
 day
 and
 starving
 to
 making
 $12
 a
 day,


which
 doesn't
 sound
 like
 much
 makes
 them


rich
 in
 that
 community.
 So,
 we're
 doing


that.
 It's
 like
 I
 just
 I
 love
 taking


things
 to
 scale,
 too.
 It's
 like
 I
 love


the
 individual
 impact
 and
 I
 love
 the
 the


global
 impact.
 The
 combination
 of
 the


two
 make
 life
 ever
 challenging
 and
 ever


exciting


>> with
 people
 like
 Mark
 and
 entrepreneurs.


My
 last
 question
 about
 this
 pattern


recognition
 and
 my
 last
 question
 is
 just


as
 me
 as
 a
 you
 know
 I'm
 I'm
 an


entrepreneur.
 I'm
 building
 businesses
 at


the
 moment.
 I'm
 earlier
 in
 my
 journey


much
 earlier
 than
 someone
 like
 Mark.
 But


what
 is
 the
 pattern
 that
 you've
 seen
 in


these
 exceptional
 founders
 and


entrepreneurs
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 building


great
 businesses
 that
 you
 would
 impart


on
 me?


>> I
 don't
 think
 there's
 anything
 I'm
 going


to
 impart
 on
 you
 that
 you
 don't
 already


know
 because
 the
 fundamentals
 are
 so


simple.
 Um,
 you
 have
 to
 the
 business
 has


to
 be
 more
 than
 a
 vehicle
 for
 money.
 And


don't
 get
 me
 wrong,
 I
 mean,
 there
 are


people
 who have
 certainly
 succeeded
 that


way.
 But
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 people
 that


build
 something
 that's
 lasting,
 it
 has


to
 be
 a
 passion
 where
 it's
 something
 you


believe
 in
 so
 much.
 It's
 so
 valuable.


It's
 a
 contribution
 sense
 to
 you,
 not


just
 an
 economic
 sense.
 Because
 in
 the


beginning
 of
 a
 business,
 it's
 like


having
 a
 child.
 You
 know,
 you
 know,
 you


don't
 get
 a
 lot
 back.
 You
 work
 around


the
 clock.
 You'll
 discover
 when
 your


first
 child
 comes
 and
 you
 love
 them.


It's
 it's
 the
 pride
 of
 ownership.
 But
 if


you're
 just
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 start
 a


business
 think
 they're
 gonna
 get
 rich


overnight
 or
 make
 some
 and
 those
 people


never
 succeed.
 So
 it's
 like
 finding


something
 a
 vision
 that
 not
 only
 you


believe
 in
 but
 others
 are
 completely


moved
 by
 because
 you
 can
 attract
 people.


You
 can't
 build
 an
 organization
 without


great
 people.
 And
 do
 you
 think
 I
 could


run
 all
 these
 companies
 if
 I
 was
 just


sitting
 there
 every
 day?
 I
 mean
 I've
 got


some
 of
 the
 greatest
 leaders
 I
 could


possibly
 recruit.
 I'm
 constantly
 looking


for
 the
 second
 part
 which
 is
 how
 do
 I


find
 leaders?
 How
 do
 I
 find
 leaders
 that


are
 smarter
 than
 I
 am
 in
 various
 areas


and
 where
 I
 can
 pull
 together
 the
 right


people
 together
 and
 create
 a
 culture


that
 adds
 a
 massive
 value
 and


continually
 does
 so
 until
 it
 dominates


the
 that
 industry
 or
 that
 market
 or
 that


marketplace.
 So
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 find


something
 that's
 more
 than
 just
 a


business
 for
 you.
 It
 has
 to
 be
 more
 than


economics
 for
 you.
 It
 has
 to
 be
 a


mission
 for
 the
 most
 successful
 people.


You
 have
 to
 be
 able
 to
 have
 something


you
 can
 articulate
 that
 can
 attract


people.
 And
 you
 have
 to
 constantly
 find


the
 very
 best
 that
 you
 can.
 And
 you
 got


to
 constantly
 prune
 because
 the
 law
 of


familiarity
 shows
 up.
 That's
 what
 your


friends
 went
 through,
 right?
 They
 got


all
 these
 great
 things
 but
 know
 how


great
 it
 is
 after
 a
 while
 it's
 familiar.


You
 know,
 it's
 like
 they
 don't
 they


don't
 have
 the
 same
 hunger.
 I
 look
 for


not
 only
 wickedly
 smart
 people,
 which
 I


love,
 but
 hungry
 people.
 When
 people
 ask


me
 like,
 "What
 is
 the
 one
 common


denominator
 of
 people
 that
 succeed
 on
 a


massive
 scale
 around
 the
 world?"
 I'd


always
 in
 the
 beginning
 say,"Well,
 I


love
 wicked
 intelligence,
 but
 I
 know
 a


lot
 of
 very
 smart
 people
 that
 can't


fight
 their
 way
 out
 of
 a
 paper
 bag
 in


their
 relationship
 or
 their
 finances."


You
 know,
 they're
 smart
 in
 one
 area,
 not


another.
 But
 the
 one
 that
 is
 absolutely


completely
 accurate
 is
 hunger.
 The


hunger
 to
 be
 more,
 to
 do
 more,
 to
 give


more,
 to
 share
 more.
 Somebody
 who
 has
 a


hunger
 that
 doesn't
 die,
 not
 a
 hunger
 to


get
 make
 a
 certain
 amount
 of
 money
 or
 a


hunger
 to
 achieve,
 you
 know,
 a
 swimsuit


size,
 but
 a
 hunger
 that's
 unquenchable.


Those
 are
 the
 people
 that
 you
 know
 their


names
 because
 they
 have
 an
 impact.
 So


it's
 like
 whether
 it's
 Richard
 Branson


who's
 in
 his
 70,
 he
 has
 the
 same
 hunger


today
 as
 when
 he
 was
 16
 years
 old
 in


that
 crypt
 in
 your
 country
 coming
 up


with
 Virgin,
 right?
 I
 mean
 it's
 same


level.
 Let's
 give
 it
 a
 go,
 right?
 He's


got
 that
 peace,
 you
 know?
 Anybody
 you


see,
 you
 know,
 look
 at
 the
 people
 you


have
 on
 your
 show
 and
 think
 about
 how


many
 of
 them
 still
 have
 that
 hunger.


Kevin
 Hart
 is
 a
 friend
 of
 mine.
 I
 know


he's
 been
 on
 your
 show.
 I
 mean,
 he's
 one


of
 the
 hardest
 working
 guys,
 but
 he's


hungry.
 He
 loves
 it.
 He
 want
 he
 just


wants
 to
 do
 it
 all.
 To
 me,
 that's
 the


gift.
 and
 stoking
 your
 hunger
 or


awakening
 someone's
 hunger
 that
 doesn't


have
 it.
 That's
 a
 real
 gift
 and
 that's


one
 of
 the
 gifts
 I
 think
 I've
 tried
 to


refine
 within
 myself
 and
 help
 people


with.


>> My
 last
 question
 is
 of
 all
 the
 things


we've
 talked
 about
 today
 and
 everything


else
 that's
 going
 on
 in
 your
 life
 and


the
 world,
 what
 is
 the
 most
 important


thing
 we
 should
 have
 talked
 about
 that


we
 didn't
 talk
 about?


>> We
 covered
 a
 lot
 of
 territory.
 I'm


impressed
 by
 the
 diversity
 of
 what
 we


got
 to
 cover.
 Thank
 you.
 We
 went
 deep.


Um
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 there's
 anything
 that


off
 the
 top
 of
 my
 head
 right
 now.
 I
 I
 do


think
 that
 I
 hope
 people
 leave
 with
 the


idea
 that
 if
 I'm
 stressed
 in
 my
 life,
 I


got
 to
 stop
 managing.
 I
 got
 to
 start


creating.
 And
 that
 that
 sounds
 like
 just


an
 overwhelming
 thing,
 but
 it's
 like


creating
 life
 on
 your
 terms.
 Like


deciding
 what
 are
 the
 immutables.
 It's


like
 um
 if
 you
 want
 to
 take
 the
 island,


you
 got
 to
 burn
 your
 boats.


>> Uh
 if
 if
 you
 have
 a
 way
 to
 go
 back,
 the


mind
 will
 rationalize
 and
 you
 will
 go


back.
 But
 if
 you
 really
 are
 committed
 to


a
 greater
 quality
 of
 life,
 you
 got
 to


master
 the
 science
 of
 achievement
 and


the
 art
 of
 fulfillment.
 And
 fulfillment


is
 not
 like
 achievement.
 There's
 very


cool
 real
 rules
 for
 achievement
 like


what
 to
 do
 with
 your
 body,
 multiple


ones,
 but
 there's
 certain
 fundamentals


that
 are
 immutable.
 What
 to
 do


financially,
 certain
 things
 that
 are


immutable.


Fulfillment


that
 success
 without
 fulfillment
 is


failure.
 And
 fulfillment
 is
 an
 art.
 It's


not
 a
 science.
 It's
 different
 for
 you


and
 me
 and
 everybody
 we
 meet.
 And
 so
 I


I'll
 tell
 you
 one
 real
 fast
 example.
 I


know
 we've
 gone
 over
 in
 time.
 Um
 Steve


Win's
 a
 good
 friend
 of
 mine,
 built
 most


of
 Las
 Vegas.
 Brilliant
 guy.
 Absolutely


brilliant.
 And
 um
 one
 day
 Steve
 calls


up.
 He
 goes,
 "There's
 a
 painting
 that
 I


have
 coveted
 for
 over
 a
 decade
 and
 he


goes,
 "I
 just
 recently
 outdid
 everybody


at
 Southbes
 and
 it
 just
 got
 delivered


and
 you
 got
 to
 see
 it."
 And
 I
 said,


"Okay,
 I
 can't
 see."
 I
 said, "But
 I
 got


to
 ask
 a
 question.
 How
 much
 did
 it
 set


you
 back?"
 And
 he
 goes,
 "$86.9
 million.


I
 go,
 "8
 $86.9
 million."
 Okay,
 I
 got
 to


see
 what
 an
 $87
 million
 painting
 looks


like.
 So,
 I
 go
 to
 his
 house.
 He
 takes
 me


in,


shows
 me
 this
 wall.
 It's
 a
 red
 square.


It's
 a
 Rothco,
 if
 you
 know
 what
 a
 Rothco


is.
 It's
 a
 red
 square.
 And
 it's
 not


totally
 red,
 a
 little
 red
 and
 orange,


right?
 And
 I
 look
 at
 him.
 I
 go,
 "Steve,


they
 missed
 some
 spots."
 And
 he
 looks
 at


me
 and
 gives
 me
 the
 look.
 And
 I
 start
 to


tease
 him
 a
 little
 bit.
 I
 go,
 "Steve,
 if


you
 give
 me
 a
 $100
 worth
 with
 the
 red


paint
 and
 you
 give
 me
 10
 minutes,
 I


think
 I
 can
 match
 this."
 And
 I'm
 just


screwing
 him
 with
 a
 little
 bit.
 He
 knows


I'm
 screwing.
 He
 goes,
 "You
 know,
 this


is
 a
 Rothco."
 I
 said, "I
 know."
 He
 goes,


"No,
 but
 you
 don't
 know."
 Like,
 you


know,
 he
 committed
 suicide.
 He
 tells
 me


the
 whole
 story,
 right?
 And
 I
 go,
 "Well,


that
 better
 be
 blood
 of
 his
 for
 $87


million,
 right?"
 But
 the
 reason
 I
 tell


you
 the
 story
 is
 it's
 not
 making
 fun
 of


Steve.
 It's
 making
 fun
 of
 me.
 He
 can


look
 at
 that
 and
 he
 can
 barely
 see.
 And


he
 knows
 what
 every
 stroke
 means.
 It
 has


meaning
 for
 him.
 He
 knows
 what
 it's


about,
 what
 it
 means,
 the
 uniqueness
 of


it.
 He's
 the
 man's
 life.
 I
 see
 a
 red


square.
 He
 has
 an
 experience.


The
 richness
 of
 life
 is
 when
 you
 go


deeper
 and
 figure
 out
 what
 makes
 you


feel
 like
 it's
 a
 red
 square
 for
 someone


else,
 but
 this
 is
 your
 thing.
 This
 is


what
 fulfills
 you.
 I
 know
 what
 fulfills


me.
 Family,
 love,
 as
 you
 can
 probably


tell,
 and
 contribution
 in
 a
 meaningful


way.
 Light
 me
 up
 like
 a
 Christmas
 tree,


and
 they've
 made
 me
 go
 for
 66
 years,
 and


it'll
 keep
 me
 going,
 right?
 But
 people


got
 to
 find
 what
 that
 is
 for
 themselves.


Because
 if
 you
 succeed
 and
 you're
 not


fulfilled,


what
 do
 you
 got?
 How
 many
 people
 have


taken
 their
 life?
 They're
 super


successful
 on
 the
 surface,
 but
 they


weren't
 fulfilled.
 Some
 of
 the
 people


made
 everybody
 on
 earth
 laugh
 when
 they


took
 their
 life.
 Some
 people
 did


businesses
 and
 took
 their
 life.
 You


don't
 want
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 most


people
 are going
 to
 take
 their
 life,
 but


you
 don't
 want
 to
 live
 more
 decades
 and


not
 really
 be
 here,
 not
 experiencing


fulfillment.
 So,
 my
 passion
 is
 to
 help


people
 be
 fulfilled,
 not
 just
 achieve.


>> Amen.
 I
 mean,
 I've
 got
 so
 many
 other


photos
 that
 I
 might
 as
 well
 show
 you.


The
 ones
 that


>> This
 is
 the
 moment
 my
 wife
 and
 I
 met.


>> That
 is
 the
 moment
 you
 met.


>> Literally
 the
 moment
 we
 met.
 How
 did
 she


get
 the
 one?


>> That's
 my
 mom.
 That's
 Jim
 Robbins.
 This


man
 adopted
 me.


>> This
 one
 here.


>> Oh,
 that's
 down
 uh
 this
 one
 is
 actually


down
 in
 Haiti.
 I
 went
 down
 there.
 That's


where
 first
 group
 people
 went
 to
 save


>> all
 these
 kids.
 These
 were
 kids
 that
 had


been
 trafficked.


>> Yeah.
 my
 brother
 and
 sister.
 Wow,
 you
 do


your
 homework.
 Very
 impressive.


>> We
 We
 have
 a
 closing
 tradition
 where
 the


last
 guest
 leaves
 a
 question
 for
 the


next,
 not
 knowing
 who
 they're
 leaving
 it


for.
 And
 the
 question
 left
 for
 you
 is,


if
 you
 could
 choose
 your
 life
 span,
 how


long
 would
 it
 be
 and
 at
 what
 point
 would


you
 choose
 to
 die?


>> That's
 a
 great
 question.
 Well,
 I


certainly
 would
 want
 to
 live
 um
 as
 long


as
 my
 family
 does,
 and
 now
 I've
 got
 to


live
 a
 little
 longer
 because
 I
 got
 a


four-year-old.
 Um


I
 don't
 know
 if
 I'd
 want
 to
 live


forever.
 Um


I
 don't
 know.
 You
 know,
 there's
 talk


about,
 you
 know,
 uploading
 your


consciousness
 to
 a
 machine
 and
 so
 forth.


I
 don't
 I
 believe
 in
 spirit
 and
 soul.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 that's
 going
 to
 be


uplifted
 machine.
 Maybe
 I'm
 wrong.
 Maybe


it's
 just
 the
 process.
 But
 I
 want
 to


leave
 as
 much
 legacy
 as
 possible.
 I
 want


to
 live
 as
 long
 as
 I'm
 interested
 and


useful.
 You
 know,
 those
 are
 the
 two


things
 that
 are
 really
 matter.
 And
 you


know,
 my
 minimum
 I
 think
 is
 92
 is
 my


goal
 as
 if
 I
 had
 control,
 right?
 Life


will
 tell
 me.
 But
 92
 for
 the
 number
 that


somehow
 I've
 had
 in
 my
 head
 and
 what


some
 of
 the
 boosts
 we
 have
 with
 bio


chemistry
 and
 element
 stem
 cells,
 who


knows?
 Maybe
 it
 goes
 past
 100.
 But
 uh
 I


think
 a
 century
 of
 living
 and
 giving


would
 be
 an
 extraordinary
 experience
 for


me.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I'd
 want
 to
 live
 for


eternity,
 but
 I'm
 not
 at
 that
 point


where
 that's
 really
 a
 choice,
 so
 I
 don't


have
 to
 think
 about
 it.
 Um,
 I
 I
 will


tell
 you
 the
 only
 fear
 that
 I've
 really


felt
 in
 my
 life
 was
 dying
 too
 soon.
 I


think
 part
 of
 my
 drive
 early
 on
 was
 just


I
 want
 to
 squeeze
 everything
 out
 of
 life


while
 I'm
 here.
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 it's


come
 from.
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 couple


things
 could
 have
 contributed
 to
 it,
 but


I
 think
 death
 was
 a
 good
 counselor
 for


me.
 It
 gave
 me
 drive
 to
 the
 today.
 It


it's
 not
 a
 fear
 for
 me
 other
 than
 I
 want


to
 be
 here
 as
 long
 as
 I
 can
 for
 my


family
 and
 for
 especially
 all
 my


children.
 but
 especially
 my
 youngest.


But
 yeah,
 that
 would
 be
 my
 answer.
 I'd


say
 not
 forever,
 but
 as
 long
 as
 I'm


useful
 and
 helpful
 and
 I
 can
 enjoy
 it


all.


>> You
 use
 the
 word
 legacy
 there.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 legacy
 is
 um
 what
 I
 leave


when
 I'm
 gone.
 In other
 words,
 I
 don't


have
 to
 be
 here
 to
 continue
 to
 have


impact,
 right?
 It's
 like
 that's
 the
 best


part
 of
 life.
 I
 I
 looked
 at,
 you
 know,


leadership
 is
 influence,
 right?
 What


makes
 you
 a
 leader
 is
 your
 ability
 to


influence
 thoughts,
 feelings,
 emotions,


actions,
 another
 person
 if
 you're
 a


positive
 leader
 for
 good.
 And
 I
 look
 at


levels
 of
 influence.
 One
 is
 can
 you


influence
 someone
 to
 change
 their
 state?


Then
 it's
 can
 you
 influence
 them
 to


change
 your
 state
 when
 you're
 not
 there?


So
 you're
 no
 longer
 a
 manager,
 right?


You've
 changed
 their
 values.
 Could
 you


change
 your
 state
 and
 they're
 not
 there


for
 a
 group
 of
 people?
 Right?
 Could
 you


change
 your
 state
 with
 a
 mass
 number
 of


people
 and
 you're
 not
 there?
 Right?
 That


to
 me
 is
 the
 ultimate
 level
 of


influence.
 And
 now
 with
 audios
 and


videos
 and
 AI,
 especially
 with
 AI,
 I've


got
 an
 AI
 that's
 amazing.
 I
 mean,
 we


have
 4.9
 in
 Apple
 and
 people
 love
 it
 and


their
 lives
 changed
 by
 it.
 And
 I'm
 I'm


working
 right
 now
 with
 another
 group
 um


to
 create
 a
 platform
 for
 interventions


and
 therapy
 that's
 not
 just
 me
 with
 AI


because
 there
 aren't
 enough
 therapists.


There
 aren't
 enough
 great
 therapists
 in


the
 world.
 I
 want
 to
 have
 that.
 It's


already
 in
 50
 languages.
 So
 the
 whole


world
 I
 want
 to
 leave
 a
 legacy
 that
 the


world
 has
 people
 that
 can
 help
 them
 24/7


365.
 And
 I
 think
 AI
 is
 one
 of
 the
 tools.


It's
 getting
 better
 and
 better
 to
 do


that.


>> And
 what
 happens
 when
 you
 die?
 Where
 do


you
 go?
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 anything
 in


the
 universe
 I
 know
 nothing
 in
 the


universe
 ever
 destroys
 it
 changes
 form.


What
 does
 that
 look
 like?
 Do
 I
 have


conscious
 awareness
 that
 as
 I
 do
 now?
 I


don't
 know
 the
 answer
 to
 that
 question.


Uh
 all
 I
 want
 to
 do
 is
 make
 sure
 I
 live


fully
 while
 I'm
 here
 and
 whatever's
 next


when
 it
 shows
 up,
 I'll
 I'll
 take
 that


journey.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 uh
 for
 so


many
 reasons.
 I
 think
 you've
 been
 a


you've
 been
 a
 mentor
 to
 so
 many
 of
 us


for
 for
 so
 long
 in
 so
 many
 ways.
 Whether


it's
 I
 remember
 how
 profoundly
 impacted


I
 was
 when
 I
 watched
 your
 um
 your
 piece


on
 Netflix
 and


>> Oh,
 no.
 Your
 guru.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 That
 was
 really
 the
 front
 door
 for


me
 into
 your
 world.
 I'd
 seen
 I'd
 seen


your
 work
 before
 I'
 I'd
 read
 the
 books


and
 stuff,
 but
 for
 me
 that
 was
 really
 a


paradigm
 shifting
 moment.
 I
 think
 it
 was


in
 that
 documentary
 where
 there
 was
 a


young
 man
 who
 was
 suicidal.
 Yeah,
 it
 was


that
 one.
 The
 Netflix
 I'm
 not
 there
 was


Yeah,
 there
 was
 one.
 That's
 how
 it


started
 actually.


>> Matias.


>> Yes.
 Matteas.


>> Matteas.


That
 was
 what
 six
 years
 ago?


>> No.
 No,
 that
 was
 2014.


>> 2014.
 Okay.
 Wow.


>> Yeah.


>> Gosh.


>> There
 was
 a
 young
 woman
 there
 also.
 I


don't
 know if
 you
 remember
 the
 young


woman
 that
 was
 in
 that
 sex
 cult
 where


they
 made
 the
 children
 have
 sex
 with
 the


adults.


>> That
 one
 was
 very
 emotional.
 I
 was
 down


in
 Brazil
 and
 I
 was
 doing
 a
 seminar
 for,


you
 know,
 about
 10,000
 people.
 And
 I'm


walking
 through
 the
 aisle
 and
 this
 woman


kept
 looking
 at
 me
 and
 then
 I
 didn't


realize
 it.
 She
 goes,
 "Don't
 you


recognize
 me?"
 And
 it
 was
 her.
 She
 got


herself
 out
 of
 the
 group.
 She's
 wrote
 a


book.
 She's
 now
 a
 therapist.
 She
 helps


other
 people
 get
 out
 of
 it.
 So,
 it's


really
 fun
 to
 see
 years
 later.
 We


actually
 did
 a
 follow-up
 at
 the
 7-year


mark
 or
 something
 like
 that
 afterwards


to
 show
 what
 happened
 with
 these


families.
 It's
 been
 really
 nice
 to
 see.


>> Did
 you
 say
 his
 name?
 His
 name
 was


Matias.
 Matias.


>> Matias,
 I
 believe.
 Matias.
 He
 he
 just


wanted
 to
 he
 sent
 an
 email
 just
 to
 say


that
 for
 anyone
 that
 doesn't
 know,
 he


was
 a
 a
 guy
 in
 the
 audience
 who
 was
 had


suicidal
 ideiation
 and
 was
 clearly


struggling.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 it's
 been
 what
 a
 decade
 roughly
 since


then.
 you
 you
 supported
 him,
 you
 helped


him.
 And
 he's
 just
 sent
 an
 email
 to
 say


that
 attending
 that
 event
 that
 day
 was
 a


huge
 dream
 for
 him
 and
 the
 experiences


that
 he
 got
 from
 that
 have
 completely


changed
 the
 trajectory
 of
 his
 life.
 And


those
 memories
 continue
 to
 impact
 him
 as


he
 continues
 to
 support
 um
 his
 growth,


his
 habits,
 his
 decisions,
 and
 his


outcomes.
 And
 he
 wanted
 to
 send
 his


regards
 to
 you
 for
 that.


>> That
 was
 really
 kind
 of
 him
 to
 reach


out.
 That's
 nice.
 I
 love
 seeing
 people
 a


year
 later,
 10
 years
 later,
 20
 years


later.
 That's
 the
 great
 gift
 of
 my
 life.


I
 walk
 down
 the
 street
 anywhere
 on


earth.
 Sarah
 desert
 has
 happened
 to
 me


in
 China.
 People
 come
 up
 and
 say,
 "You


changed
 my
 life."
 And
 I
 always
 remind


them,
 "I
 didn't
 change
 your
 life.
 You


did,
 but
 glad
 I
 got
 to
 help.
 What


happened?"
 And
 then
 they
 tell
 me


stories.
 And
 outside
 my
 family,
 there's


nothing
 that
 gives
 me
 more
 joy
 than
 to


hear
 those
 stories.


>> Well,
 you've
 done
 that
 for
 more
 people


than
 I
 could
 possibly
 receive
 emails


from.
 Um,
 hundreds
 of
 billions
 really,


if
 we're
 counting
 the
 amount
 of
 people,


the
 amount
 of
 meals
 you
 fed
 through
 the


the
 work
 you've
 done
 through
 your


company.
 you
 even
 you've
 invested


tremendously
 also
 in
 in
 saving
 the


planet
 through
 your
 green
 energy


investments
 which
 we
 didn't
 get
 to
 talk


about
 today
 but
 I'm
 going
 to
 link
 that


below
 for
 people
 to
 read
 about.


>> One
 thing
 I
 would
 mention
 if
 I
 may
 is
 I


uh
 Paramount
 approached
 me
 and
 we
 now


have
 a
 24-hour
 day
 channel
 and
 uh
 it's


it's
 a
 fast
 channel
 so
 it's
 free


advertised
 supported
 television.
 It's
 a


TV
 I
 grew
 up
 with
 instead
 of
 cable.
 So,


if
 you
 go
 to
 um
 whether
 it's
 Pluto
 or
 if


you
 go
 to
 Roku
 or
 if
 you
 go
 to
 Amazon


Prime
 and
 you
 look
 for
 live
 TV,
 there's


the
 Tony
 Robbins
 network
 and
 24
 hours
 a


day
 there's
 content
 there
 that's
 free


that
 anybody
 can
 watch
 and
 educate


themselves
 and
 they're
 full
 of


interventions
 like
 these
 that
 you
 talked


about.
 So,
 I
 hope
 some
 people
 will
 check


it
 out
 because
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 way
 I'm


another
 way
 I'm
 trying
 to
 give
 people
 a


gift
 to
 support
 their
 lives.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 link
 that
 below
 and
 also


I'm
 going
 to
 put
 a
 link
 below
 to
 your


free
 3-day
 virtual
 event
 called
 Time
 to


Rise
 which
 I
 think
 we
 mentioned.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 Please
 come
 to
 that.
 You
 don't


want
 to
 say
 come.
 You
 can
 do
 it
 from


anywhere
 in
 the
 world.
 Your
 office,
 your


home.
 And
 it's
 coming
 up
 on
 the
 29th


through
 the
 31st
 of
 January.


>> And
 it's
 perfect
 timing
 at
 the
 start
 of


the
 new
 year.
 People
 thinking
 about


making
 a
 change
 in
 their
 life.
 I'm
 going


to
 link
 that
 below
 as
 well
 if
 anybody


wants
 to
 attend.
 It's
 free
 3
 days
 and


it's
 uh
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 great


continuation
 of
 the
 conversation
 we've


had
 today
 because
 we've
 talked
 so
 much


about
 change,
 a
 changing
 world,
 and
 how


to
 change
 thyself.
 And
 um
 that's
 what


you've
 done
 for
 me.
 It's
 what
 you've


done
 for
 so
 many
 people.
 And
 it's
 an


absolute
 honor.
 It's
 actually
 for
 me


there
 have
 certain
 moments
 when
 I
 in
 the


job
 that
 I
 do
 where
 I
 think
 [ __ ]
 hell


like
 how
 lucky
 I'm
 grateful
 am
 I
 to
 get


to
 do
 this
 and
 this
 is
 one
 of
 those
 such


moments
 that
 is
 a
 is
 a
 real
 dream
 for
 me


because
 you're
 you're
 such
 a
 huge


inspiration
 to
 me.
 So
 thank
 you
 so
 much


Tony
 for
 your
 graciousness.
 I
 appreciate


>> I
 just
 want
 you
 I
 feel
 the
 same
 way.
 I


feel
 like
 uh
 you're
 the
 next
 wave
 of


contribution
 to
 this
 world
 and
 you're


doing
 an
 amazing
 job
 already
 but
 I
 got
 a


ticket
 to
 your
 parade.
 I'm
 gonna
 watch


how
 you
 evolve
 over
 the
 next
 couple
 of


decades
 and
 I
 know
 your
 your


contributions
 will
 only
 grow
 because
 I


feel
 the
 sincerity
 in
 your
 heart
 not


only
 to
 grow
 but
 to
 give
 and
 uh
 I
 hope


that
 you
 continue
 to
 move
 towards
 that


love
 and
 contribution
 you're
 talking


about
 cuz
 I
 think
 that's
 your
 true


essence.
 I
 think
 that's
 really
 what


drives
 you
 anyway.


>> I
 think
 so
 too.


>> Yeah.
 Thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you.


>> This
 is
 something
 that
 I've
 made
 for


you.
 I've
 realized
 that
 the
 direio


audience
 are
 striv


goals
 that
 we
 want
 to
 accomplish.
 And


one
 of
 the
 things
 I've
 learned
 is
 that


when
 you
 aim
 at
 the
 big
 big
 big
 goal,
 it


can
 feel
 incredibly
 psychologically


uncomfortable
 because
 it's
 kind
 of
 like


being
 stood
 at
 the
 foot
 of
 Mount
 Everest


and
 looking
 upwards.
 The
 way
 to


accomplish
 your
 goals
 is
 by
 breaking


them
 down
 into
 tiny
 small
 steps.
 And
 we


call
 this
 in
 our
 team
 the
 1%.
 And


actually
 this
 philosophy
 is
 highly


responsible
 for
 much
 of
 our
 success


here.
 So
 what
 we've
 done
 so
 that
 you
 at


home
 can
 accomplish
 any
 big
 goal
 that


you
 have
 is
 we've
 made
 these
 1%
 diaries


and
 we
 released
 these
 last
 year
 and
 they


all
 sold
 out.
 So
 I
 asked
 my
 team
 over


and
 over
 again
 to
 bring
 the
 diaries
 back


but
 also
 to
 introduce
 some
 new
 colors


and
 to
 make
 some
 minor
 tweaks
 to
 the


diary.
 So
 now
 we
 have
 a
 better
 range
 for


you.
 So,
 if
 you
 have
 a
 big
 goal
 in
 mind


and
 you
 need
 a
 framework
 and
 a
 process


and
 some
 motivation,
 then
 I
 highly


recommend
 you
 get
 one
 of
 these
 diaries


before
 they
 all
 sell
 out
 once
 again.
 And


you
 can
 get
 yours
 now
 at
 the
 diary.com


where
 you
 can
 get
 20%
 off
 our
 Black


Friday
 bundle.
