From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Rachel


Abrams
 and
 this
 is
 the
 Daily.


The
 latest
 release
 of
 files
 related
 to


the
 sex
 offender
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 left


key
 questions
 about
 his
 rise
 to
 power


and
 his
 connections
 to
 the
 president


unanswered.


Today,
 my
 colleague
 David
 Enrich


explains
 how
 he
 and
 a
 team
 of
 reporters


worked
 to
 fill
 in
 those
 mysteries
 and


reveal
 the
 truth
 about
 Jeffrey
 Epstein's


origins.


It's
 Tuesday,
 December
 23rd.


David
 Enrich,
 welcome
 to
 the
 show.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> David,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 probably
 your


fourth
 or
 fifth
 appearance
 on
 the
 show


this
 year
 to
 talk
 about
 Jeffrey
 Epstein.


And
 this
 time
 we're
 having
 you
 back


because
 on
 Friday
 there
 was
 obviously


this
 massive
 file
 release
 from
 the


Justice
 Department
 that
 as
 far
 as
 I


understand
 it
 did
 not
 really
 advance
 our


understanding
 of
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 or
 his


crimes
 or
 the
 people
 in
 his
 orbit.
 Can


you
 tell
 us
 what
 you
 think
 the
 biggest


takeaways
 were?


>> It's
 a
 hard
 question
 because
 there
 were


not
 huge
 takeaways
 and
 we
 got
 lots
 of


bits
 of
 incremental
 color
 and
 detail


that
 reinforced
 the
 deep
 depravity
 of


Epstein's
 crimes
 and
 the
 horrible
 things


he
 was
 doing.
 We
 also
 got
 some
 new


tidbits.
 We
 saw,
 for
 example,
 Bill


Clinton
 in
 numerous
 photos
 with
 Epstein


and
 his
 associates,
 including
 in
 a


swimming
 pool.
 We
 saw
 that
 one
 of


Epste's
 victims
 back
 in
 1996
 had


reported
 him
 to
 the
 FBI
 for
 having
 child


sexual
 abuse
 material.
 And
 that's
 a


decade
 before
 we
 know
 the
 federal


prosecutors
 actually
 started


investigating
 Epstein.
 So
 that
 was
 a


definitely
 a
 new
 development.
 But
 for


the
 most
 part,
 there
 was
 nothing
 here


that
 fundamentally
 altered
 our


understanding
 of
 Epstein
 and
 his


network.
 and
 notably
 also
 very
 little


about
 Donald
 Trump
 whose
 name
 was
 barely


mentioned
 in
 these
 files.
 And
 it
 was


Trump's
 relationship
 with
 Epstein
 that


triggered
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 political


interest
 in
 this
 investigation
 to
 begin


with.


>> Right.
 Just
 to
 remind
 people,
 this
 whole


file
 of
 release
 is
 coming
 about
 because


of
 a
 massive
 pressure
 campaign,
 mostly


from
 Democrats,
 but
 also
 from
 some


within
 the
 MAGA
 orbit
 for
 Donald
 Trump


and
 his
 administration
 to
 release
 the


so-called
 Epstein
 files,
 right?
 And
 that


basically
 forced
 Trump
 to
 sign


legislation
 authorizing
 these
 files
 to


be
 released
 from
 the
 Justice
 Department.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 worth
 noting
 that
 the
 Justice


Department
 did
 not
 do
 what
 it
 was


legally
 required
 to
 do,
 which
 was


release
 all
 of
 the
 files.
 And
 those


files
 that
 were
 released
 were
 in
 many


cases
 so
 heavily
 redacted
 that
 you


couldn't
 make
 any
 sense
 of
 them.


>> And
 why
 didn't
 they
 release
 them?
 The


Justice
 Department
 has
 said
 that
 they


will
 release
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 files
 on
 an


kind
 of
 a
 rolling
 basis
 over
 the
 next


few
 weeks
 and
 that
 they
 need
 this


additional
 time
 to
 be
 able
 to
 properly


review
 and
 redact
 these
 huge
 quantities


of
 materials.


>> Okay.
 So,
 knowing
 that
 there
 would
 be


this
 sort
 of
 staggered
 release,
 what


were
 you
 expecting
 to
 get
 or
 or
 maybe


more
 importantly,
 what
 questions
 were


you
 hoping
 that
 this
 batch
 of
 files


would
 actually
 answer?
 I
 mean
 it
 depends


on
 your
 perspective
 and
 what
 your


interest
 is
 in
 this.
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 one


of the
 biggest
 questions
 that
 many


victims
 have
 and
 many
 people
 who
 have


been
 focusing
 on
 Epste
 for
 a
 while
 are


are
 there
 other
 men
 who
 were
 enabling


him
 or
 participating
 in
 sex
 crimes
 with


him.
 And
 for
 me
 and
 my
 colleagues,
 I


I've
 been
 working
 with
 Matt
 Goldstein,


Jessica
 Silver
 Greenberg,
 and
 Steve
 Eer


for
 months
 now
 to
 really
 understand


Epstein's
 financial
 web
 that
 he
 wo
 and


looking
 at
 his
 origins
 and
 how
 he
 went


from
 kind
 of
 this
 rags
 to
 rich's
 story


where
 he
 managed
 to
 transform
 himself


from
 a
 working-class
 family
 into
 an


extraordinarily
 rich
 and
 well-connected


person.
 And
 so
 we
 were
 wondering
 if


there
 would
 be
 any
 revelations
 in
 these


files
 about
 that.
 And
 we're
 just


completely
 disappointed
 in
 that
 regard.


>> Well,
 that
 reporting
 that
 you
 mentioned


is
 what
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 about


because
 everybody's
 been
 eagerly


awaiting
 the
 release
 of
 these
 files,


right?
 Like
 hoping
 perhaps
 that
 the


files
 would
 address
 some
 of
 these


enduring
 questions
 about
 Epstein
 and
 his


crimes.
 And
 obviously
 that
 did
 not


happen
 on
 Friday.
 But
 you
 and
 our


colleagues
 have
 been
 digging
 into
 a


different
 period
 of
 Epstein's
 life,
 one


that
 preceded
 the
 era
 of
 his
 most


flagrant
 criminal
 activity
 that
 he


became
 known
 for,
 that
 he
 was
 arrested


for.
 Why
 was
 that
 period
 your
 focus?
 Why


was
 it
 important
 in
 your
 estimation
 to


understand
 the
 early
 period
 of
 Epstein's


life?
 Well,
 Epstein
 built
 an
 extensive


sex
 trafficking
 operation
 all
 over
 the


world
 and
 that
 was
 really
 expensive
 and


it
 required
 the
 support
 of
 a
 lot
 of


powerful
 people.
 And
 so
 the
 question
 for


us
 has
 been
 how
 did
 he
 get
 in
 a
 position


where
 he
 had
 the
 money
 and
 the
 power
 and


the
 connections
 to
 do
 that.
 This
 was
 a


guy
 who
 came
 from
 a
 really
 working-class


background.
 He
 grew
 up
 in
 Coney
 Island


in
 Brooklyn.
 His
 dad
 was
 an
 employee
 of


the
 New
 York
 City
 parks
 department.
 He


was
 really
 kind
 of
 scraping
 by
 growing


up
 and


>> then
 somehow
 starts
 to
 climb
 this
 ladder


which
 will
 bring
 him
 to
 the
 upper


echelons
 of
 Wall
 Street
 and
 American


politics.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 absence
 of


information
 about
 Epstein
 and
 his
 early


years
 has
 given
 rise
 to
 just
 a
 vast


number
 of
 conspiracy
 theories
 ranging


from
 that
 Epstein
 was
 running
 this
 super


sophisticated
 blackmail
 operation
 to


that
 he
 was
 affiliated
 with
 intelligence


services.
 And
 the
 period
 from
 basically


the
 mid
 1970s
 to
 the
 early
 1990s
 for
 the


most
 part
 has
 been
 just
 a
 complete
 black


box.
 And
 so
 our
 goal
 when
 we
 started


reporting
 on
 this
 months
 ago
 was
 to
 try


and
 get
 inside
 that
 black
 box
 and
 figure


out
 how
 Epstein
 got
 his
 start.
 And
 the


bottom
 line
 of
 how
 he
 did
 that
 was
 that


he
 was
 an
 extremely
 successful
 con
 man.


He
 stole,
 he
 deceived,
 he
 manipulated,


and
 he
 learned
 over
 and
 over
 again
 that


he
 could
 do
 so
 basically
 with
 impunity.


>> So
 where
 does
 the
 story
 begin?


>> It
 begins
 in
 1976.
 Epstein
 is
 a
 teacher


at
 the
 Dalton
 School
 in
 Manhattan
 and
 he


gets
 invited
 to
 a
 reception
 at
 an
 art


gallery
 and
 he
 goes
 kind
 of
 grudgingly


in
 his
 tongue
 and
 at
 the
 reception
 he


bumps
 into
 the
 parent
 of
 one
 of
 his


students
 who
 is
 impressed
 with
 his
 math


chops.
 And
 the
 parent
 suggests
 that


maybe
 he
 is
 wasting
 his
 time
 being
 a


teacher
 and
 instead
 should
 consider
 a


career
 in
 Wall
 Street.
 And
 the
 parent


then
 introduces
 Epstein
 to
 a
 guy
 named


Ace
 Greenberg.


>> Very
 big
 name.


>> Yeah.
 who
 at
 the
 time
 was
 a
 top


executive
 at
 Bear
 Sterns,
 which
 is
 this


scrappy
 Wall
 Street
 investment
 bank.
 And


one
 of
 the
 ways
 in
 which
 it's
 scrappy
 is


that
 it
 is
 not
 going
 to
 hire
 Ivy
 League


MBAs.
 It
 is
 looking
 for
 what
 Ace


Greenberg
 likes
 to
 call
 PSDs,
 which


stands
 for
 poor,
 smart,
 and
 deeply


desirous
 of
 being
 rich.


>> Wow.


>> And
 Epste
 goes
 in
 to
 meet
 Greenberg
 for


a
 job
 interview.
 And
 Epste
 fits
 the


bill.
 Greenberg
 is
 bowled
 over
 by
 the


guy's
 charisma
 and
 charm.
 and
 apparent


math
 prowess
 and
 offers
 him
 a
 job.


So
 he
 arrives
 at
 Bear
 Sterns
 and
 he


quickly
 becomes
 the
 protege
 to
 some
 of


the
 firm's
 top
 executives.
 One
 is


Greenberg,
 the
 guy
 who
 hired
 him,
 who
 is


so
 taken
 with
 Epstein
 that
 he
 introduces


him
 to
 his
 own
 20-year-old
 daughter,
 and


they
 start
 dating,
 which
 affords
 Epstein


something
 akin
 to
 protected
 status
 at


the
 firm.
 And
 that
 really
 quickly
 comes


in
 handy
 because
 within
 a
 couple
 of


months
 of
 his
 arrival
 at
 Beer
 Sterns,


Epstein's
 boss,
 a
 guy
 named
 Michael


Tenenbomb,
 learns
 from
 the
 HR
 department


that
 Epstein
 had
 lied
 on
 his
 resume


about
 having
 graduated
 from
 college.


>> And
 so
 Tenbomb
 summons
 Epste
 into
 his


office,
 is
 not
 really
 sure
 what
 to
 do


about
 this
 because,
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 a


very
 serious
 infraction.
 On
 the
 other


hand,
 the
 guy
 is
 dating
 the
 boss's


daughter
 and
 confronts
 Epstein
 with


this,
 expecting
 Epstein
 to
 lie
 and


dissemble
 and
 deny,
 which
 in
 that
 case


would
 allow
 Tennibomb
 to
 easily
 fire


him.
 Instead,
 Epstein
 says,
 "You're


right.
 It's
 true.
 I
 did
 lie."
 And
 the


reason
 he
 lied,
 Epstein
 goes
 on
 to
 say,


is
 that
 if
 he
 didn't
 lie,
 there
 is
 no


way
 a
 firm
 like
 Beer
 Sterns
 or
 anyone


else
 is
 going
 to
 give
 him
 a
 chance


without
 having
 a
 college
 diploma.
 And


Tenbomb
 is
 so
 taken
 aback
 and
 disarmed


by
 this
 honesty
 that
 he
 decides
 to
 give


Epstein
 a
 second
 chance.
 And
 this
 is
 a


pattern
 we
 will
 see
 repeating
 over
 and


over
 and
 over
 again.


>> It's
 sort
 of
 remarkable
 because
 first
 of


all,
 he
 gets
 this
 job
 because
 in
 a
 way


Ace
 Greenberg
 is
 like
 fetishizing
 his


lower
 middle
 class
 background,
 right?


Something
 that
 would
 have
 been
 a


disadvantage
 to
 somebody
 else
 is
 an


advantage
 to
 Epstein.
 He
 gets
 his
 foot


in
 the
 door.
 And
 then
 when
 he
 gets


caught,
 he
 doesn't
 just
 make
 himself


sympathetic.
 He
 actually
 makes
 himself
 a


victim
 of
 the
 institution
 where
 he's


working,
 right?
 Like
 I
 had
 no
 choice
 but


to
 lie.
 Otherwise,
 you
 big
 powerful
 mean


Wall
 Street
 bank
 would
 never
 have
 taken


a
 chance
 on
 me.


>> Yeah.
 And
 to
 tennbomb,
 you
 know,
 this
 is


now
 what
 40
 or
 45
 years
 later.
 When
 I


spoke
 to
 him,
 he
 was
 still
 kind
 of


marveling
 at
 Epstein's
 knack
 for


understanding
 human
 dynamics
 so
 well


that
 just
 on
 the
 spur
 of
 the
 moment,
 he


understood
 that
 that
 would
 be
 something


that
 was
 likely
 to
 get
 him
 a
 second


chance.


>> And
 sure
 enough,
 it
 worked.


>> So
 what
 happens
 next?


>> Well,
 he
 keeps
 his
 job
 and
 he
 starts


very
 quickly
 climbing
 through
 the
 ranks


at
 Bear
 Sterns.


Within
 a
 few
 years,
 he
 has
 been
 named
 a


limited
 partner,
 which
 means
 that
 he
 is


getting
 paid
 boatloads
 of
 money
 at
 that


point.
 Something
 like
 $800,000
 in


today's
 dollars.
 And
 yet,
 the
 problems


still
 keep
 bubbling
 up.
 I
 mean,
 Epstein


was
 found
 to
 abuse
 his
 expense
 account.


He
 took
 a
 work
 trip
 to
 the
 Caribbean
 and


charged
 Beer
 Sterns
 something
 like


$10,000
 on
 jewelry
 and
 clothing
 for
 his


girlfriend.
 So,
 this
 is
 after
 he
 was


dating
 the
 boss's
 daughter.


>> Mhm.
 Another
 thing
 is
 that
 it
 turns
 out


that
 he
 has
 been
 helping
 his
 girlfriend


get
 early
 access
 to
 lucrative
 investment


deals
 at
 Bear
 Sterns,
 which
 is
 a


violation
 certainly
 of
 the
 company's


rules
 if
 not
 the
 law.
 And
 he's
 helping


his
 high
 school
 friend
 get
 a
 loan
 to
 buy


securities
 at
 Bear
 Sterns,
 which
 is
 also


a
 violation
 of
 company
 policies
 if
 not


the
 law.
 And
 eventually
 Beer
 Sterns
 gets


wind
 of
 this
 and
 starts
 investigating.


And
 Epstein
 is
 kind
 of
 headed
 for
 a
 slap


on
 the
 wrist.
 he's
 likely
 to
 get
 uh
 pay


a
 financial
 penalty
 and
 also
 be


suspended
 for
 a
 couple
 of
 months.
 And


instead
 of
 suffering
 that
 indignity,
 he


decides
 to
 resign,
 saying
 that
 he's
 been


deeply
 offended
 by
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 was


even
 being
 investigated.


So,
 one
 of
 the
 many
 things
 he
 learned
 at


Bear
 Sterns
 through
 this
 network
 of


acquaintances
 and
 colleagues
 that
 he


built
 up
 was
 basically
 how
 to
 act
 and


behave
 as
 a
 really
 rich
 person.


>> Is
 this
 like
 which
 fork
 to
 use
 or
 is


this
 about
 acting
 comfortable
 or
 giving


off
 an
 air
 of
 ease
 in
 the
 face
 of


>> It's
 both.
 It
 is
 what
 fork
 to
 use.
 It's


how
 to
 dress
 appropriately,
 how
 to


introduce
 yourself
 to
 a
 member
 of


royalty
 or
 to
 a
 senior
 politician,
 but


it's
 also
 to
 have
 the
 confidence
 that
 he


belongs
 in
 these
 settings,
 in
 these


rooms
 with
 rich
 and
 powerful
 people.
 And


that
 immediately
 pays
 dividends
 for
 him.


A
 former
 Bear
 Sterns
 colleague


introduces
 him
 to
 a
 guy
 named
 Michael


Stroll,
 who
 is
 a
 video
 game
 executive,


and
 Epstein
 persuades
 Stroll
 to
 hand
 him


$450,000,


which
 is
 about
 10%
 of
 Stroll's
 net


worth,
 to
 invest
 in
 what
 Epste
 claims
 is


an
 oil
 deal.


>> There's
 no
 evidence
 that
 any
 oil
 deal


existed.
 And
 Stroll
 loses
 virtually
 all


of
 his
 money
 and
 keeps
 pestering


Epstein,
 saying,
 "Where
 is
 my
 money?
 you


promised
 me
 we
 would
 get
 this
 kind
 of


payout.
 Epstein
 rebuffs
 him
 over
 and


over
 again.
 At
 one
 point
 sends
 him
 a


pint
 of
 crude
 oil
 to
 convince
 him
 that


the
 oil
 deal
 actually
 does
 exist.
 Wow.


>> But
 the
 money
 is
 just
 gone
 ultimately.


And
 so
 this
 is
 one
 of
 Epstein's
 huge


first
 killings.
 He
 walks
 away
 with
 what


appears
 to
 be
 several
 hundred,000
 of


money
 that
 he
 just
 stole
 from
 this
 guy.


And
 nothing
 really
 happens.
 And
 Stroll


files
 a
 lawsuit
 against
 him.
 It
 bounces


around
 the
 federal
 court
 system
 for


years.
 Ultimately,
 Epstein
 prevails
 on


technical
 grounds.
 And
 so
 Epste
 is
 now


two
 for
 two.
 He
 cheated
 and
 lied
 at
 Bear


Sterns
 and
 essentially
 got
 away
 with
 it.


Now
 he's
 cheating
 and
 lying
 with
 this


video
 game
 executive
 and
 walking
 away


with
 his
 money
 once
 again
 with
 impunity.


And
 for
 someone
 like
 Epstein,
 the


message
 there
 is
 very
 clear,
 which
 is


that
 if
 you
 lie
 and
 cheat
 well
 enough


and
 often
 enough
 and
 are
 sufficiently


manipulative,
 you
 can
 make
 a
 real
 living


doing
 this.


>> So,
 he's
 not
 only
 learning
 that
 he
 can


get
 away
 with
 it,
 but
 it
 sounds
 like


he's
 learning
 that
 he's
 getting
 away


with
 it
 at
 a
 larger
 level
 and
 with


people
 who
 are
 arguably
 within
 his


social
 network.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 right.
 And
 Epstein
 is


nothing
 if
 not
 a
 very
 good
 student
 of


fraud
 and
 thievery.
 And
 you
 can
 see
 him


progressing
 from
 one
 stage
 of
 this
 to


the
 next
 and
 getting
 more
 ambitious
 and


bolder
 and
 bolder
 the
 more
 times
 he


pulls
 this
 off
 and
 the
 more
 times
 he


gets
 away
 with
 it.


>> So
 where
 does
 he
 go
 from
 here?


>> So
 Epstein
 around
 this
 time
 has
 been


referring
 to
 himself
 as
 a
 financial


bounty
 hunter.
 basically
 someone
 who


like
 tracks
 down
 hidden
 assets
 all
 over


the
 world.
 And
 as
 it
 happens,
 we're
 in


the
 kind
 of
 early
 1980s
 at
 this
 point.


He
 is
 dating
 a
 Spanish
 actress
 named


Anna
 Obergon.


>> And
 it
 turns
 out
 that
 her
 family
 has


just
 realized
 that
 they've
 lost
 millions


of
 dollars
 in
 the
 implosion
 of
 a


securities
 firm
 in
 New
 York.
 And
 so
 they


hire
 Epstein
 to
 track
 down
 their
 missing


money.
 and
 he
 pairs
 up
 with
 a
 friend
 of


his
 who's
 a
 former
 federal
 prosecutor


and
 together
 they
 spend
 the
 next
 couple


years
 trying
 to
 track
 down
 these
 missing


assets
 and
 lo
 and
 behold
 they
 find
 them.


They're
 in
 a
 bank
 in
 the
 Cayman
 Islands


>> and
 Epstein
 and
 his
 buddy
 charter
 a
 jet


go
 down
 to
 Cayman
 and
 somehow
 walk
 away


with
 millions
 of
 dollars
 of
 these


securities.
 They
 recover
 it
 and
 get
 paid


a
 certain
 portion
 of
 that
 as
 a
 fee.
 And


so
 Epstein
 by
 this
 point
 is
 almost


certainly
 a
 millionaire,
 which
 is
 really


it's
 a
 quite
 an
 extraordinary
 turnaround


for
 a
 guy
 who
 just
 a
 few
 years
 earlier


was
 this
 working-class
 guy
 trying
 to


make
 a
 living
 as
 a
 high
 school
 teacher.


>> The
 story
 of
 the
 recovered
 money
 though


is
 also
 so
 interesting
 because
 one
 of


the
 narratives
 about
 Epstein
 in
 recent


years
 in
 recent
 memory
 is
 that
 this
 guy


was
 not
 actually
 a
 financial
 genius.


That's
 the
 thing
 you
 get
 you
 you
 hear


over
 and
 over
 again.
 And
 people
 are


like,
 why
 would
 would
 these
 billionaires


hand
 him
 millions
 of
 dollars
 to
 manage


when
 he
 wasn't
 proving
 himself
 as


singular
 in
 any
 particular
 way?
 But
 this


is
 the
 only
 story
 I
 think
 I
 am
 familiar


with
 where
 he
 really
 provides
 tangible


value
 to
 people
 in
 a
 way
 that
 does
 seem


quite
 singular,


>> right?
 And
 to
 be
 frank,
 it's
 one
 of
 the


things
 I've
 struggled
 with
 a
 little
 bit


in
 reporting
 the
 story
 and
 in


understanding
 the
 story
 because
 Epstein,


he
 likes
 to
 present
 himself
 as
 this


financial
 genius.
 We
 have
 not
 seen


evidence
 to
 support
 that
 claim.
 We
 do


see
 here
 some
 glimmer
 of
 cleverness
 that


does
 set
 him
 apart.
 And
 so
 around
 this


time,
 Epstein
 has
 amassed
 enough
 money


that
 he
 has
 gone
 from
 having
 been
 kind


of
 chased
 out
 of
 Beer
 Sterns
 with
 his


tail
 between
 his
 legs
 to
 now
 he
 returns


to
 Beer
 Sterns
 this
 time
 as
 a
 valued


client.


He's
 doing
 lots
 of
 trading
 through
 the


firm
 which
 produces
 revenue
 for
 Bear


Sterns
 which
 makes
 Bear
 Sterns
 very


eager
 to
 keep
 him
 in
 its
 good
 graces.


And
 so
 they
 start
 extending
 some
 favors


to
 him.


>> Favors
 like
 what?


>> Well,
 one
 of
 Epste's
 former
 managers
 at


the
 firm
 who
 is
 now
 helping
 to
 run
 him


as
 a
 client
 has
 a
 very
 attractive
 young


assistant
 named
 Patricia
 Schmidt.
 And


one
 night
 in
 1987,
 the
 manager
 asks


Schmidt
 to
 deliver
 some
 papers
 to


Epstein's
 apartment
 at
 night.
 And


Schmidt
 goes
 over
 to
 the
 apartment.


Epstein
 makes
 her
 tea,
 gives
 her
 a
 tour


of
 his
 very
 nice
 apartment
 building,
 and


invites
 her
 to
 come
 back
 whenever
 she


wants
 to
 use
 the
 building's
 swimming


pool.
 And
 Schmidt
 takes
 him
 up
 on
 that


offer.
 And
 thus
 begins
 a
 year-long


sexual
 relationship
 between
 Schmidt
 and


Epstein.


And
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we
 found
 in
 our


reporting
 is
 that
 the
 same
 Bear
 Stern's


manager
 on
 multiple
 other
 occasions
 also


sent
 young
 female
 assistants
 over
 to


Epstein's
 apartment
 and
 that
 ended
 up


leading
 to
 sexual
 relationships.


And
 Epste
 seems
 to
 realize
 that
 if
 Bear


Sterns
 can
 use
 women
 as
 a
 source
 of


leverage,
 so
 can
 he.
 And
 Schmidt,
 when
 I


spoke
 with
 her,
 she
 was
 very
 cleareyed


about
 her
 role
 in
 this
 and
 that
 she
 was


being
 used.
 And
 the
 way
 she
 described
 it


to
 me
 was
 that
 I
 was
 his
 play
 thing
 and


Epstein
 perceived
 her
 as
 someone
 that's


going
 to
 help
 him
 get
 where
 he
 wants
 to


go.
 And
 sure
 enough,
 we
 see
 him
 start
 to


use
 Schmidt
 for
 other
 things
 such
 as
 he


would
 have
 Schmidt
 give
 his
 clients
 and


acquaintances
 tours
 around
 Wall
 Street,


bringing
 them
 into
 Bear
 Sterns,
 maybe


take
 them
 out
 to
 a
 nice
 dinner.
 And
 so


Epstein
 had
 discovered
 that
 he
 could
 use


attractive
 young
 women
 was
 a
 potent
 form


of
 currency
 as
 he
 sought
 to
 impress
 and


cultivate
 relationships
 with
 rich
 and


powerful
 people
 whom
 he
 wanted
 to
 do


business
 with.


>> He's
 taking
 advantage
 of
 the
 fact
 that


other
 people
 are
 motivated
 by
 sex
 and


they
 might
 do
 something
 for
 him
 if
 he


does
 something
 for
 them,
 i.e.
 send
 this


woman
 out
 to
 meetings
 with
 them.
 As
 far


as
 we
 can
 tell,
 this
 is
 probably
 the


first
 time
 that
 Epstein
 has
 really
 fully


discovered
 his
 ability
 to
 use
 women
 to


really
 advance
 his
 own
 agenda.
 And
 at


the
 same
 time
 around
 now,
 Epstein
 has


also
 really
 cultivated
 enough


connections
 and
 built
 enough
 wealth
 that


those
 things
 start
 compounding
 upon
 each


other.


And
 we
 will
 see
 over
 the
 ensuing
 decade


that
 Epstein
 really
 takes
 that
 to
 the


next
 level
 and
 starts
 building


connections
 with
 kind
 of
 the
 creme
 de
 la


creme
 of
 American
 finance
 and
 society.


And
 so
 he'll
 build
 and
 exploit


relationships
 with
 people
 like
 David


Rockefeller,
 like
 Les
 Wexner,
 the
 retail


tycoon,
 ultimately
 with
 big
 institutions


and
 big
 banks
 like
 JP
 Morgan.
 And
 this


is
 the
 Epstein
 who
 we
 all
 now
 know,


right?
 is
 someone
 who
 has
 built
 this


huge
 network
 not
 only
 of
 young
 women
 and


girls
 whom
 he's
 abusing
 but
 also
 this


cast
 of
 rich,
 powerful,
 famous
 men
 who


have
 supported
 him
 and
 enabled
 him
 along


the
 way.


>> We'll
 be
 right
 back.


So
 David,
 you've
 described
 a
 lot
 of
 the


lessons
 that
 Epstein
 learned
 in
 his


early
 years
 that
 allowed
 him
 to
 climb


his
 way
 up
 the
 social
 ladder,
 that


allowed
 him
 to
 amass
 great
 wealth,
 and


of
 course
 enabled
 his
 criminal
 activity


over
 many,
 many
 years.
 But
 one
 name
 that


you
 have
 not
 mentioned
 is
 Donald
 Trump.


and
 pressure
 on
 the
 president
 is
 what


led
 to
 the
 disclosure
 of
 these
 files


because
 people
 want
 to
 understand
 what


evidence
 the
 government
 has
 about


Jeffrey
 Epstein
 and
 his
 criminal


behavior
 and
 the
 network
 in
 which
 he


operated.
 And
 so
 I
 wonder
 then
 how
 are


we
 to
 think
 about
 where
 Donald
 Trump


fits
 into
 Epstein's
 early
 years?


>> Well,
 Epstein
 and
 Trump
 were
 operating


in
 very
 similar
 social
 circles
 for
 a


number
 of
 years.
 basically
 from
 the
 late


1980s
 into
 the
 early
 2000s.
 They
 were
 at


times
 apparently
 very
 close
 friends.
 And


our
 colleague
 Nick
 Confesori
 has
 just


spent
 months
 digging
 into
 this.
 And
 one


of
 the
 findings
 in
 his
 investigation
 was


that
 not
 only
 were
 they
 close
 friends


for
 years,
 but
 they
 were
 also
 competing


with
 each
 other
 for
 young
 women.
 And


Nick
 and
 his
 story
 described
 Epstein
 and


Trump
 as
 being
 one
 another's
 wingmen.


That
 being
 said,
 there
 are
 still
 a
 lot


of
 unanswered
 questions
 about
 the
 exact


nature
 of
 that
 relationship.
 If
 there


were
 business
 dealings
 between
 the
 two


of
 them,
 for
 example,
 and
 it
 is
 not


clear
 to
 me
 whether
 there
 are
 answers


that
 are
 lurking
 in
 these
 as
 yet


undisclosed
 Epstein
 files
 that
 the
 Trump


administration
 is
 sitting
 on.
 And
 one


way
 to
 think
 about
 this
 is
 that
 at
 the


outset,
 what
 the
 Justice
 Department
 has


been
 told
 and
 is
 required
 under
 law
 to


release
 are
 files
 related
 to
 the
 federal


investigations
 of
 Epstein
 over
 the


years.
 And
 it
 is
 not
 clear
 to
 me
 that


federal
 investigators
 were
 doing
 a
 whole


lot
 of
 investigating
 into
 the
 men
 with


whom
 Epstein
 was
 associated,
 whether


that's
 Trump
 or
 men
 like
 Leon
 Black
 or


Les
 Wexner
 or
 people
 like
 that.
 And
 so


to
 the
 extent
 that
 those
 were
 not


subjects
 of
 investigation,
 we're
 not


likely
 to
 see
 a
 tremendous
 amount
 about


them
 in
 these
 files.
 But
 at
 the
 same


time,
 there's
 also
 a
 question
 of
 why


exactly
 Trump
 and
 his
 administration


have
 been
 so
 reluctant
 to
 come
 clean


about
 what
 is
 in
 these
 files
 to
 begin


with.
 And
 if
 they
 had
 just
 released
 this


stuff
 when
 they
 said
 they
 would
 back


early
 in
 this
 year,
 we
 might
 not
 be


talking
 about
 this
 anymore.
 or
 in
 the


fact
 that
 they
 have
 been
 fighting
 so


hard
 against
 full
 transparency
 here,
 it


does
 suggest
 that
 there
 is
 something
 in


there
 that
 they
 want
 to
 hide.


>> But
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 one
 of
 the
 things


I've
 never
 quite
 understood
 about
 the


Epstein
 files,
 as
 we
 have
 been
 calling


them,
 is
 if
 there
 was
 evidence
 of


criminal
 behavior
 on
 the
 part
 of
 Trump


or
 any
 of
 these
 other
 notable
 figures


that
 has
 been
 in
 the
 possession
 of
 the


DOJ
 across
 multiple
 administrations
 for


years.
 And
 so
 I
 don't
 mean
 to
 come
 off


as
 naive
 and
 say
 like
 if
 the
 DOJ
 had


evidence
 of
 crimes,
 why
 would
 they
 not


investigate
 it?
 But
 I
 I
 just
 don't
 quite


understand
 why
 exactly
 we
 believe
 that


it
 wouldn't
 have
 come
 out
 before
 now.


>> It's
 not
 self-evident
 that
 this
 would


have
 already
 come
 out
 for
 at least
 two


reasons.
 One
 reason
 is
 that,
 you
 know,


it's
 become,
 I
 think,
 accepted


conventional
 wisdom
 that
 if
 an


administration
 has
 damaging
 information


about
 its
 political
 enemies
 that
 that


will
 immediately
 be
 released.
 That
 is


not
 the
 way.
 justice
 departments
 have


historically
 operated.
 And
 so
 it's


entirely
 possible
 that
 a
 previous


administration's


justice
 department
 might
 have
 had


damaging
 information
 about
 its
 opponents


that
 it
 kept
 under
 wraps
 because
 it
 was


supposed
 to
 do
 so.
 That's
 thing
 one.


Thing
 two
 is
 that
 it
 is
 also
 entirely


possible
 that
 there
 could
 have
 been


reports
 or
 suspicions
 or
 investigative


trails
 that
 were
 followed
 that
 did
 lead


to
 powerful
 men
 and
 powerful


institutions
 and
 those
 investigations


went
 nowhere.
 Maybe
 because
 there
 wasn't


evidence,
 but
 also
 it
 could
 be
 because


there's
 a
 a
 long
 history
 of
 federal


investigators
 not
 aggressively
 pursuing


cases
 that
 involve
 white
 collar


defendants.
 When
 you
 have
 some
 of
 the


richest,
 most
 powerful
 people
 in
 the


world,
 it
 is
 not
 surprising
 and
 it's
 not


a
 conspiracy
 to
 think
 that
 those
 people


might
 get
 away
 with
 it.


>> I
 guess
 the
 reason
 why
 I'm
 sort
 of


lingering
 on
 this
 is
 that
 it
 feels
 like


everybody
 is
 waiting
 for
 another
 shoe
 to


drop.
 Everyone
 is
 waiting
 with
 baited


breath
 to
 see
 what's
 in
 these
 files
 and


maybe
 these
 files
 will
 finally
 answer


our
 persistent
 questions
 about
 Epstein's


orbit
 and
 Donald
 Trump.
 But
 it
 feels


like
 the
 picture
 that's
 emerging,
 at


least
 from
 your
 reporting,
 is
 that
 we


already
 kind
 of
 know
 the
 answer
 about


how
 Epstein
 became
 Epstein
 in
 some
 way,


which
 is
 that
 he
 didn't
 need
 to
 be
 a


secret
 spy
 or
 whatever
 these
 other


conspiracy
 theories
 that
 have
 popped
 up


in
 intervening
 years
 would
 suggest.
 He


just
 needed
 to
 be
 a
 remarkably
 savvy
 guy


who
 learned
 very
 early
 on
 that
 he
 could


manipulate
 people.
 He
 could
 commit


crimes
 and
 he
 could
 basically
 get
 away


with
 anything
 he
 wanted
 as
 he
 climbed
 up


the
 ladder.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that's
 right.
 And
 I
 think


there's
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 really
 good


reporting
 that
 has
 peeled
 back
 a
 lot
 of


layers
 of
 the
 Epstein
 story.
 I
 do
 think


that
 there
 are
 still
 a
 bunch
 of
 layers


left
 to
 unpeel.
 And
 I'm
 not
 holding
 out


a
 huge
 degree
 of
 confidence
 that
 these


files
 as
 they
 get
 released
 are
 going
 to


do
 much
 of
 that
 peeling,


>> but
 I
 do
 think
 there
 is
 still
 a
 ton
 of


important
 questions
 that
 have
 not
 been


answered.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 Epstein
 saga


for
 years
 now
 has
 been
 kind
 of
 a


political
 roar
 test
 and
 that
 people
 on


the
 left
 or
 many
 people
 on
 the
 left
 view


it
 as
 a
 weapon
 with
 which
 to
 go
 after


Donald
 Trump.
 I
 think
 on
 the
 right
 a
 lot


of
 people
 view
 this
 as
 a
 vehicle
 to


attack
 kind
 of
 liberal
 globalist


institutions
 and
 individuals.
 And
 I


think
 the
 truth
 is
 probably
 somewhere
 in


the
 middle,
 right?
 That
 there
 are
 a
 lot


of
 very
 rich
 powerful
 men
 who
 enabled


Epstein
 and
 may
 have
 participated
 in


some
 of
 his
 crimes.
 I
 do
 not
 think
 that


there
 has
 been
 very
 much
 accountability


for
 those
 men
 yet.
 And
 I
 don't
 think


that
 we
 have
 a
 full
 sense
 of
 what


information
 may
 or
 may
 not
 be
 in
 these


government
 files
 pertaining
 to
 those


men.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 reason
 people
 think


that
 there
 may
 be
 more
 shoes
 to
 drop,


it's
 partly
 that
 their
 dreams
 of
 having


their
 political
 enemies
 crushed
 by
 the


Epstein
 scandal
 remain
 unfulfilled.
 But


it's
 also
 partly
 of
 recognition
 that


there
 were
 so
 many
 people
 involved
 in


supporting
 Epstein
 and
 allowing
 his


criminal
 network
 to
 prosper


>> that
 it
 just
 doesn't
 feel
 right
 that


only
 two
 people,
 Jeffrey
 Epste
 and
 his


associate
 Gain
 Maxwell
 have
 really
 been


held
 to
 account
 for
 this
 so
 far.
 Okay,


but
 speaking
 of
 being
 held
 accountable,


I
 do
 wonder
 if
 that's
 the
 takeaway
 here


because
 on
 the
 one
 hand,
 obviously


Jeffrey
 Epstein
 died
 in
 a
 jail
 cell.
 On


the
 other
 hand,
 he
 got
 away
 with


horrific
 crimes
 and
 amassed
 so
 much


money
 and
 power
 over
 the
 years.
 We've


been
 talking
 this
 whole
 conversation


about
 the
 lessons
 that
 Epstein
 learned


in
 order
 to
 do
 that,
 but
 I
 do
 wonder


what
 lessons
 we
 as
 the
 public
 should


learn
 looking
 at
 Epstein's
 story
 and
 how


he
 came
 to
 an
 end.


Well,
 look,
 dying
 in
 a
 jail
 cell
 is
 no


one's
 idea
 of
 a
 happy
 ending.
 That
 said,


the
 story
 of
 Epstein
 is
 really
 one
 of


impunity,
 and
 he,
 as
 you
 said,
 got
 away


with
 this
 for
 years,
 despite
 repeated


red
 flags,
 despite
 many
 warnings,


despite
 many
 victims
 coming
 forward
 and


trying
 to
 blow
 the
 whistle
 on
 him.
 And


to
 me,
 it's
 also
 a
 broader
 story
 of


impunity.
 Not
 just
 about
 Jeffrey


Epstein,
 but
 the
 people
 around
 him,
 many


of
 whom
 really
 have
 not
 had
 a
 public


reckoning
 about
 the
 roles
 they
 play
 in


this.


The
 reason
 that
 people
 remain
 obsessed


about
 Epstein
 to
 a
 large
 degree,
 I


think,
 is
 that
 there
 are
 so
 many
 people


out
 there
 who
 have
 not
 had
 a
 similar


public
 reckoning.
 And
 so
 to
 me,
 that's


the
 great
 takeaway
 that
 for
 people
 with


a
 lot
 of
 money
 and
 power
 and


connections,
 they
 really
 can
 act
 with


impunity.


>> David
 Enrich,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> Late
 on
 Monday
 night,
 the
 Department
 of


Justice
 released
 more
 files
 related
 to


the
 investigation
 of
 Jeffrey
 Epstein.


The
 documents
 contained
 hundreds
 of


references
 to
 President
 Trump,
 although


most
 of
 them
 are
 from
 media
 reports,


unverified
 tips,
 and
 discussions
 among


investigators,
 including
 a
 mention
 that


Trump
 was
 a
 passenger
 on
 Epstein's


private
 jet
 eight
 times
 between
 1993
 and


1996.


None
 of
 the
 mentions
 appear
 to
 be


evidence
 of
 wrongdoing.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.


President
 Trump
 announced
 on
 Monday
 that


the
 Navy
 would
 build
 two
 new
 quote
 Trump


class
 battleships
 with
 the
 eventual
 goal


of
 acquiring
 25.
 The
 move
 was
 the
 latest


example
 of
 the
 president
 rebranding
 an


aspect
 of
 the
 federal
 government
 in
 his


image.


The
 announcement
 also
 comes
 as
 the
 US


has
 ratcheted
 up
 its
 threats
 against


Venezuela's
 President
 Nicholas
 Maduro


and
 intercepted
 tankers
 that
 serve
 the


country's
 oil
 industry.
 And
 in
 a
 move


that
 prompted
 criticism
 from
 a
 veteran


correspondent,
 CBS
 News
 abruptly
 removed


a
 segment
 about
 El
 Salvador's
 notorious


SECOT
 prison
 from
 an
 episode
 of
 60


Minutes
 after
 the
 network's
 new
 chief,


Barry
 Weiss,
 said
 the
 segment
 needed


additional
 reporting.
 The
 decision
 drew


condemnation
 inside
 and
 outside
 the


network
 where
 critics
 of
 Weiss
 saw
 the


move
 as
 evidence
 that
 the
 network
 was


more
 interested
 in
 cowtowing
 to
 the


Trump
 administration
 than
 preserving
 its


journalistic
 integrity.
