ADI IGNATIUS: Walmart is
the world's largest company,
its biggest private employer,
and its most successful
retailer, with 255 million
customer visits per week.
Doug McMillon started
his career there in 1984
as an hourly associate and,
30 years later, became a CEO.
Under his leadership,
the company
has become a digital as well
as brick-and-mortar powerhouse.
It has increased pay and
benefits for its workers.
It's leveraged technology to
improve the customer experience
and worked to create a more
environment-friendly supply
chain.
Doug, thank you very
much for joining us.
DOUG MCMILLON: Hey, Adi.
Great to see you.
ADI IGNATIUS: Doug, it is
always great to have you here.
Thank you for making the time.
So let's just jump right in.
It's never easy
running a big company.
With AI poised to
disrupt, with recurring
waves of geopolitical
uncertainty--
what does it take
to lead consistently
in an environment like this?
DOUG MCMILLON: I
think remembering
who you are is important but
also being open to change.
And when I think about
what AI presents,
the first thing that
goes through my mind
is the growth opportunity.
I think right after
generative AI captured
everyone's attention,
we were pretty balanced
in terms of our mindset
between offense and defense.
And I think that's
shifted over time
to being offensive in our
orientation and growth oriented.
We'll talk, I'm sure, at
some point about agentic AI.
But there's a great
opportunity for us
to change how people shop and
be able to save them even more
time, things like that.
So we're excited about the
opportunity that AI presents.
And as it relates to
geopolitical issues and things
like that, there's
been turbulence now
for quite a few years.
And I think we've
just learned how
to operate in that environment.
ADI IGNATIUS: Well,
let's talk about AI.
How do you think about it?
One is tempted to
think, all right,
so AI offers these tremendous
efficiencies, possibly
at the expense of
human employment.
What is the core AI thinking
at Walmart at this point?
DOUG MCMILLON: Well, again,
growth is the first thing
that I think of.
And the e-commerce experience
hasn't changed that much since
it really started back in
the '90s with a search bar
and a laundry list.
And now we have an
opportunity to create
an e-commerce experience that's
multimedia, more personalized,
contextual, really change the
digital side of the equation.
And we're really
focused on that.
As it relates to
changes to employment,
I really do think that
every job we've got
is going to change in some way.
Whether it's getting the
shopping carts off the parking
lot, or it's the way
our technologists work,
or, certainly, the way
leadership roles change,
I can imagine how AI will
change every one of those jobs.
And it will create new jobs.
We're starting to
see some of that.
All of those new jobs
we've seen already
are AI oriented in some way.
It will eliminate some tasks
and eliminate some roles.
And what we want to
do is equip everybody
to be able to make the
most of the new tools that
are available, learn, adapt,
add value, drive growth,
and still be a really large
employer years from now.
That's the goal that
we're working towards.
So we've done things like give
everybody a ChatGPT license
and give everyone other tools
so that they can learn and grow
and go through this process
with us as a company.
ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah.
So you're heading a company
that from its founding
has always been very purpose
driven, the founding family.
And you've articulated
that as well
since you've taken over CEO.
That must evolve, though, right?
Has the core purpose--
or maybe the
auxiliary purposes--
kind of shifted over time
and since you've become CEO?
DOUG MCMILLON: When Sam Walton
accepted the Presidential Medal
of Freedom shortly before he
passed away, back in 1992,
he articulated a purpose for
the company, as far as I know,
the first time that
he had articulated it.
And it was basically,
we'll show people
what it's like around
the world to save money
and have a better life, to
live a better lifestyle.
And so those words have become
save money, live better.
We wake up every day trying
to create value for all
of our customers and members.
But that live better part of
the equation, to your point,
has changed over time.
If you look at what happened in
the mid 2000s with the work we
did, led by Lee Scott, to become
a more sustainable company,
as just one example of
how the mandate broadened.
These days, we obviously think
about not only saving people
money but saving people time,
strengthening communities,
strengthening the planet,
playing a role in health care.
I think the part
that has changed
is a more specific view
of what live better means
and how we can work as
associates to improve lives.
ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah.
And I always find it
interesting to think
about a very purpose-driven
company with very intense profit
pressures.
And you must feel--
and I'm sure you'd love the
answer to be, we maximize both.
But there must be
a push and pull.
How difficult is it to keep
purpose front and center
when you have these short-term
and longer-term profit
pressures?
How do you handle that balance?
DOUG MCMILLON: Yeah.
It's probably important
to remind everyone
that now a little
over 10 years ago, we
made a number of
investments that
were really sizable, all
pretty much at the same time.
We invested in higher wages.
Eventually, that
became investments
in free education and things
beyond just the wage rate.
But we invested in our
people, billions of dollars.
We invested in lower
prices, billions of dollars.
We invested in e-commerce,
billions of dollars.
And we also invested to
modernize our tech stack.
As we did all of
those things, we
took the profitability
of the company down.
Our operating income percentage
peaked somewhere north of 8%.
Sam Walton once famously
danced the hula on Wall Street
because the management team
back then hit a target of 8%
or higher on operating income.
And when I moved into this role,
the operating income percentage
was about 6%.
With all those investments
that I just mentioned,
we went all the way down to
just a little north of 4%--
so a pretty dramatic investment
that our shareholders
paid for so that we could
change the company and get
positioned for the future.
It was really pretty cool
to watch the Walton family
and our board of directors
work through those decisions
with the management team
to lay out those choices
and to make them and to reduce
the profitability of the company
so that we could position
the company for the future
and fulfill our purpose
at the same time.
We didn't ask our
customers to pay for it.
We didn't ask anybody
else to pay for it.
Of course, it's really been the
shareholders that paid for it.
And then if you look at
what's happened as of late,
because our business
model has changed,
e-commerce led to membership
opportunity and advertising
opportunity, other
forms of income.
We've been able to turn that
operating income percentage
back up while keeping
prices low and continuing
to invest in wages.
So that played out over a
period of quite a few years
and I think has caused us to
be able to live our purpose
and, at the same time,
transform the company.
ADI IGNATIUS: If anything
in this conversation
inspires you to do
a hula, feel free.
DOUG MCMILLON: [LAUGHS]
That won't happen.
ADI IGNATIUS: Well, we'll see.
We'll see.
DOUG MCMILLON: Sam--
ADI IGNATIUS: We're just
getting started here.
DOUG MCMILLON: --took
care of that part.
ADI IGNATIUS: So you've been
through a number of shocks
recently, right?
We all have been.
And the COVID pandemic
is one of them
and resulting in
supply-chain shocks.
I think we're all looking at
companies like Walmart that
import a lot, to what
extent are tariffs
changing your business, either
overtly or not so overtly.
Maybe talk about-- since the
tariffs thing is still ongoing,
start with--
what lesson did you
take, guiding Walmart
through pandemic
supply-chain shocks before?
What did you learn from that
experience that's maybe relevant
now, going forward?
DOUG MCMILLON: Yeah.
It would take a
long time, I think,
to share everything we learned
about ourselves and the company
as we went through the pandemic.
The thing that comes to
the top of the list for me
is just how capable
our associates were.
That includes our
store associates,
supply-chain associates,
Sam's Club associates.
It also includes our leaders.
And what I experienced is just
how good their judgment was
and how fast they
can make decisions.
Before the pandemic, I thought
we were moving quicker.
We want to move with speed,
never really satisfied
as it relates to that.
But during the pandemic,
everything just sped up so much.
And there were so
many decisions to make
about how to keep
people safe, how
to manage the supply
chain, everything
during that period of time--
how to help with COVID testing,
how to eventually help
with immunizations.
And we picked up the
cadence of the company.
And as we were all
operating on Zoom,
my leadership team
and I were too.
And we went from what was
a weekly, monthly cadence
to a daily, weekly cadence.
And we were together
every morning,
surfacing choices that
needed to be made.
And we didn't know,
as others in the world
didn't, all the answers
to those questions
immediately, of course.
And so we just were
forced to delegate more,
hand this choice to this person
or someone else in the company.
Tomorrow, tell us
what you decided
and why you made that decision.
But don't wait to act.
And wow, they made a lot of
really good decisions quickly.
And then if I look at this
most recent circumstance
as it relates to tariffs,
yet again, the team
is showing that they can manage
these quantity decisions,
change the country of
origin, move production
where they should, make really
good choices about timing
and flow.
And our inventory has
been really well managed
during the course
of this year, which
is so important as a retailer.
If you get
over-inventoried, you end up
with all these additional costs,
markdowns and many other costs.
If you have too little
goods, you end up
missing sales opportunities.
And the way they've managed
through this whole everchanging,
complex situation too
has been impressive,
just like it was
during the pandemic.
Here in the US, a little more
than 2/3 of what we sell is made
or grown here.
Today we operate
in 19 countries.
But the biggest part of our
business is in Walmart US.
And that more-than-2/3
number helps.
But that other third that comes
from around the world, including
countries like China,
Mexico, Canada, Vietnam,
and some others--
more than a hundred
countries by the time we
get through with it all.
That fluid
decision-making related
to where those goods come from
has been really well managed.
And so I've just
learned to trust people
even more than I did on
the front side of it.
ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah.
Well, I want to talk a
little more about that.
So sometimes the tariffs
are set and it's clear.
It's 10%.
It's 50%.
It's 100%.
Whatever it is, you
know what it is.
And you have to eat that
cost and pass it on or not.
But then there's the
huge uncertainty.
And it's hard to tell,
at least in Washington,
are these negotiation tactics?
Are these real?
It feels like the
level of uncertainty,
which must be so
profound for you,
sourcing so much from
all over the world--
how do you handle that
level of acute uncertainty
in your planning?
Because it's uncertain.
But then it's going
to get locked in
down the road before long.
DOUG MCMILLON: Yeah.
Well, let's use the example
of seasonal merchandise.
Take yourself back to
the spring and pretend
that you're the Halloween
costume buyer for Walmart.
How many costumes do you buy?
Where do they come from?
What price points do
you think they'll be at?
Because by the time
you receive them,
which is when the
tariff is assigned,
it could be a different
tariff number.
So we run what ifs.
If the tariff is
this amount, here's
what would probably
happen with pricing.
Then how many units would we
sell if we had that price?
Where else could we
source them from?
What will people buy if they're
under inflationary pressure?
We've learned as we've gone
through different things
over the years, for example,
that families prioritize
their children and their
pets before they prioritize
the parents.
And a mom usually
puts herself last.
And so these trade-offs
happen throughout the family.
So we were confident there
would be trick-or-treating
and children's
costumes would sell.
But we might not sell as many
adult costumes, for example.
So we just kind of all talk
through those independent
decisions and hold hands, pick
a number, and make a decision.
And as I mentioned
earlier, so far,
everyone's done a really
good job of generally getting
things right.
ADI IGNATIUS: So I
feel like we're all--
all of us who are leading
businesses-- in a period
where transformation
is perpetual.
It's not like, OK, we
figured out the technology.
We adapted.
And there you are.
How do you think
about that, trying
to make sure that
transformation isn't just
lurching from
project to project,
but is an evolving and
sustainable capability?
DOUG MCMILLON: Yeah.
You have to be willing
to change so many things.
I'm remembering, as you
asked the question, what
it was like to move into this
role almost 12 years ago.
We were running negative comps
in our US Supercenter business.
We didn't have much of an
e-commerce business to speak of.
We had some challenges in
international, where I had been.
And there were a lot of
questions about strategy
and transformation.
And what the leadership team and
I decided to do fairly early on
was to explain to everyone
what wouldn't change.
Because the list of things
that needed to change
was really long.
And if you started
talking through all that,
it'd feel pretty overwhelming.
So what we said to
everyone was, we
believe in this timeless purpose
that our founder, Sam Walton,
gave us.
We will stay committed to
helping people, helping
people save money and
live a better life.
We believe we've got the
right four core values.
And we want our
culture, our behaviors,
to match those four values.
So the Walmart that
you joined, in terms
of how people are treated
and how we want you to lead,
that's going to stay consistent.
By the way, part of those values
include striving for excellence.
So the bar is high.
Expectations are high.
But we respect the individual.
We act with integrity.
We serve the customer.
Those values are going
to be consistent.
Everything else is
open for change.
If customers don't want
stores in the future,
we won't have stores.
So we started out really trying
to play catchup on e-commerce
and build an
e-commerce business.
And that led to understanding--
largely informed
by spending time
with startups and
digital companies
and other e-commerce companies--
that we had to literally change
the way we worked.
We needed design
as a capability.
We needed product management.
We needed some roles
that technology companies
had and have that we
didn't have in the company.
And we'd grown up running
the business with operations,
our store leadership
team and our merchants
making a lot of the big
decisions when, really, we
needed to change the way
we thought and worked,
to put the customer and
member in charge and work
backwards to build
the right tech.
And that caused more
organizational change
than what I anticipated
in the beginning.
So to kind of put a
punchline on your question,
one of the things you have
to do as a big company
is to set yourself up to change
all the time and not just once.
So that means constant learning,
constant mindset shifts,
changes to structure,
new capabilities,
just a faster pace of
organizational change
so that you don't
fall behind again.
ADI IGNATIUS: Yep.
Before we started
this event today,
we asked our
audience what issues
they wanted to hear most about.
And it was interesting.
AI was-- you wonder,
is AI overhyped?
Do people-- are they tired of
hearing-- and the answer's no.
They really want insight.
So I'm going to actually go to
a couple of audience questions,
if it's OK, that relate to AI.
And one of them--
and it picks up--
you had said that you're making
AI large language modules
available to your employees.
But there's a question
from Liore Arussy--
not sure from where.
Whose responsibility is it
to adapt the new technology?
Is it about, in
your case, Walmart
investing in change
management, making it happen,
forcing it to happen?
Or is it up to the employees
to stay current and relevant?
Do they have to show
that spark of interest
in the new technology?
DOUG MCMILLON: Yeah,
great question.
It's obviously both.
If you've been inside
Walmart maybe just
at the beginning of
this year, for example,
we were all learning a lot.
One of the great
things about being here
is, you have access
to all the leaders
that are responsible
for building
the frontier of
artificial intelligence.
So you get access to
ask questions and learn.
And we were all doing that,
my direct reports and I.
And when we got
to the springtime,
we realized we needed
some additional resource.
We knew top down
what we wanted to do.
We wanted to reinvent
how e-commerce works
and how shopping
works for customers.
We wanted to equip
our associates.
We wanted to drive
productivity, of course.
We want to manage
inventory better.
We had these big
objectives that we could
click down on and explain.
But so many of us were
doing these things
on top of all the
other things we'd
been doing before this wave
of change came our way.
So we decided to create a new
role that reports directly to me
that we announced just maybe
a couple of months ago.
And that role is one filled
by Daniel Danker, who
came to us from Instacart and
had worked at Uber and Facebook
before then.
He's a product
management leader.
He's a really good thinker.
He's a problem solver.
He's native AI, lives
in the Bay Area.
And his responsibility
includes speeding up
our AI transformation.
While we're not a company
that should be investing
to build all this compute
and invent the frontier,
we do need to be the best
in the world at application.
And so Daniel's taking on that
responsibility for how we turn
this into an AI organization.
Product management, design,
tech prioritization,
and the change
management related to AI
fit within his responsibility.
So what we might have done
years ago, where we had
all these tech stacks that we'd
picked up by buying companies
around the world--
Suresh Kumar and the
team, the technologists,
had done a great job in recent
years of modernizing that tech
stack, getting us
on the road to have
platforms that work everywhere.
And now we can
infuse that with AI
in a way that causes more speed.
So from a topdown point of view,
we know what our priorities are,
and we're resourcing that
change, and we're driving it.
And it's what we spend most
of our time talking about.
And then at the same time, we
have 2.1 million associates
around the world.
And we are giving them all the
tools that we can give them
and being transparent about
what we expect from them as it
relates to their
learning journey
so that we do this together.
And I expect that we'll get some
goodness from just great ideas.
I was just reading
a note this morning
about an idea that one of our
associates in a Sam's Club
has here in the US
that she would like
to see us implement in our app.
That kind of stuff will happen
and those topdown initiatives
will be driven because we've
resourced it differently.
But again, it causes
the company to have
to work in a different way
than we would have before.
It's just constant change.
ADI IGNATIUS: Yep.
So here's another
audience question.
This is from Gavin Dia.
And it really follows up on
what you were talking about.
So to what extent
does Walmart plan
to go beyond access to tools,
some of these investments,
bringing in some of
these high-level people,
to a kind of structured
upskilling programs
to prepare the workforce for
this AI-integrated future?
DOUG MCMILLON: Yeah.
We have something called
Walmart Academies,
where we teach curriculum
to all of our associates.
We'll be using those
academies to create--
in some cases already have--
create specific programs
so that people can learn
and understand what
capabilities that they
need to be building.
And we also provide something
called Live Better U, where
we pay for college
tuition and books
so that people can go
get a degree if they
want to get a degree.
And we've had some people
move into technology roles.
I've been running into
people in the field that
want to work in cybersecurity.
And we have been creating a lot
of technicians in the company
to fix all the equipment
that we're running,
whether that's the automated
storage and retrieval
systems that we are deploying
in our distribution centers
or the HVAC equipment
we've got in stores.
There's more talent
needed in the world
to do that kind of work.
And so we've been teaching
people and certifying them
on how to do that
and, in some cases,
have started to sell those
services outside the company
and have what may grow
into a profit center.
ADI IGNATIUS: So in the
current issue of HBR--
this is another question from an
audience member, Ginger Tay, who
notes that in the current issue
of Harvard Business Review,
we have an article about
hands-on leadership.
And as CEO of one of the
largest corporations,
I think it's interesting that
you have the Walmart employee
tag on right now.
What percent of time do you
spend really on the front line?
And how valuable is that?
How relevant is that
from your position?
DOUG MCMILLON: Yeah, it's vital.
If you know anything
about our history,
you know that Sam Walton was
in the stores all the time
and became a pilot to
move around faster.
And now we've got airplanes.
And we're flying
out of Arkansas--
if I use the US as an example--
all the time to go visit stores
and clubs on a surprise basis.
On social media, you'll
see some of those visits.
And you'll hear people
say things to me like, you
should come see the real world.
99% of the time, nobody knows
we're coming, including me.
We just show up in a market.
We show up in the first
store, Sam's Club.
How are things going?
Go straight to our
associates that
are either helping
people check out
or picking orders for an
e-commerce order or whatever.
I'll be out again
tomorrow somewhere
in the United States
in stores and clubs
that don't know that I'm coming.
I love that part of the job.
I've just lately been in
Mexico, Canada, and China,
visiting with our folks in
Sam's Clubs and Walmart stores.
And the conversations
always lead to something.
I always leave one of those
visits with a list of to do's
that's longer than the list
that I leave, if anything.
Because the things
I learn, we can
use to help the whole company.
ADI IGNATIUS: So I
would say Walmart
gets praised for pursuing its
environmental and social goals.
It gets criticized for pursuing
its environmental and social
goals, depending on
who's commenting.
We're in a somewhat
different environment,
in terms of the expectations
of how companies think
about their engagement, again,
in environmental and social
issues.
How do you navigate this?
You're going to get
criticisms from all sides.
And I know you want to
stick to your purpose.
But the ground is shifting.
How do you navigate this--
DOUG MCMILLON: It hasn't been
that difficult because it's just
all super practical.
Like, the work we were doing
before was good for the P&L.
It's been good for the company.
And it still is.
So when this whole conversation
started back in the early 2000s,
I would say we were going
through a maturation process.
Just like any startup does,
you focus on your customers,
and you focus on your
associates, your employees.
And we were like that too.
And we'd grown
into this big size,
opening one store at a time.
But we still acted,
in some ways,
like an inexperienced company.
And then Lee Scott and
Rob Walton and others
caused us to start
thinking about the fact
that we had this big footprint.
And there were
things we could be
doing that would make our
business better and also
strengthen the planet and
strengthen communities.
And I tell this
story all the time.
But I remember leaving
Sam's Club at the time.
And I'm embarrassed to tell
you, we were paying people
to haul off the corrugate
behind our Sam's Clubs
as brown boxes came to
the back of the club
and we bailed them up.
And as we were going through
this learning journey
and going to visit landfills
and reading books and getting
more informed about
what we could do, given
the size of the
company, we started
realizing how much value
there was in that corrugate.
And we went from paying
somebody to take it
to charging them to take it away
because it was worth so much.
My P&L benefit about
$50 million in one year,
just because we
learned something.
We had spots like that--
but that was 20 years ago--
that we've continued to uncover
and learn as we've grown.
So whether I'm talking
to a member of the media
or I'm talking to someone that
works in government, if we're
getting criticized
for something,
I just get really practical.
Wouldn't you expect Walmart
to be eliminating its waste?
Yes.
It helps us save money so
that we can lower prices.
It's a good business choice.
So all of this work that
we're doing, that lens of,
how does this
strengthen the business
and how does it help the
customer or our associates?
That all matters.
And sometimes it just boils
down to time perspective.
And I'm in a really
good situation
here because of the
board that we've got
and the Walton family's
investment, where
I can think more long term.
And once you start
thinking longer term,
these things all just
make a lot of sense.
ADI IGNATIUS: So
I think, Doug, you
and I first met shortly before
you took on the CEO role.
And we did an HBR interview
soon after you took over.
And when you took
over, I'm sure you
had a vision of what
you wanted to achieve.
Now, looking back,
you've had to adapt.
We need to be adaptable.
What advice would you share with
other leaders who are trying
to lead major transformations?
What maybe even is a trap
that they should avoid as they
try to push toward the future?
DOUG MCMILLON:
Listen to your gut.
The thing that most
of us, I think,
as we get to more time
in role that we regret
is not going faster.
And while not everything
was clear-- back when
you and I first
met, I was really
focused on, how do you
build an e-commerce business
and turn it into
an omni business,
leveraging the assets we
had, including the stores?
And that was a lot of work.
But what I didn't
really understand is,
it was going to lead to this
bigger change in the way
the company worked and
figuring that out with our team
here and just taking steps
to try and get faster
and to become more
digital in nature.
We use a phrase around.
We're people led
and tech powered.
We want to be great at
deploying technology.
We want to be the best at that.
And we want to start with the
humanity of this experience.
Whether it's the
customers we serve
or the associates that we
have, this is about people.
And the tech is
to serve people--
so people led, tech powered.
There were things that I
just didn't know back then.
And once I did know
them, I was sometimes
too slow to act because I was
worried about what someone
thought or, can the organization
handle this much change?
And what I've learned is
that people can handle it.
And you need to go hard,
and you need to go fast.
And when you know something's
right in your bones,
you need to act on it.
And don't delay too much.
ADI IGNATIUS: Yes.
I remember that
when you were trying
to become a digital powerhouse,
you hosted an event in Davos
and brought people in
and basically said,
we're really good
at brick and mortar.
We're not good at digital.
Help us out.
Nobody goes to Davos and says
we're not good at something.
So I thought that
was refreshing.
But talk about it.
Are you happy with where
you are now in terms
of digital commerce or--
DOUG MCMILLON: No.
No.
But remember, I'm compensated
to be dissatisfied.
So that's the
nature of the work.
We just have so much
room to improve.
We've made progress,
and our customers
are having a better experience.
And Walmart is known
today with our customers
for being convenient at about
the same intensity level
as we are known for
having low prices.
So that's progress.
And I don't want
to skip over that.
Thank you to our associates
for what's been done.
But we can just
be so much better.
And this opportunity to get
AI right is a great one.
ADI IGNATIUS: And
back to AI-- so here's
another audience question.
This is from Hilda Ingham.
And this is down
to the lower level.
People fear change.
We know that.
We feel like our companies
have a secret sauce because we
do things a certain way.
And then somebody's trying
to force change on us.
How do you help people embrace
change where it's not just,
OK, the board has
figured this out.
The C-suite has
figured this out.
Go.
How do you bring people
along, understanding
that they fear change?
Some will adapt.
Some won't.
How do you handle
that part of it?
DOUG MCMILLON: Yeah.
I joke with our folks
here that I love change,
except when it relates to me.
I don't really want to change.
I just want all
of you to change.
I think being really honest
about things is important,
and being consistent
is important.
And let's take artificial
intelligence and the situation
that we're in right now.
There's so much we don't know,
like that-- literally, you
mentioned earlier this question
about, how much of this is hype?
Well, the hype curve is real.
We've seen that repeat
itself over time.
So certainly, there's
some investment here
that's happening that's
not going to work.
But big picture-- it feels
like, to me, that a lot of this
is going to work.
And we should have
this mindset that it
will work and be
moving that direction
to try and make that true so
that our customer is served
better.
And I think if you're
honest about it,
you remind everybody
what you're trying
to do-- what it is
we are trying to do
is to serve customers and
members better so that we grow,
which creates more
opportunity for everyone.
So let's lean into
this together.
And let's learn as we go.
So the rhythm of the
company comes to mind.
Like, how often
are you together?
How often are you
together in person?
We really believe in
being together in person,
including with our associates
and our store managers.
We bring people together
during the course of a year.
We've got a calendar that works
and is designed with purpose
to cause us to build
relationships, earn trust, shoot
people straight, go through
it together, remind them
of the big picture of what
we're trying to accomplish.
And then if something goes
wrong or doesn't work,
just acknowledge that.
Put it to the side.
And move on to the next thing.
But I don't know
how else to do it.
I think you've got to be really
straightforward, really honest,
give people what they need,
encourage them, support
them, but lean into change.
Because the alternative
is not very enjoyable.
ADI IGNATIUS: I love it.
Change is great, except
when it's coming after me.
Doug, we're out of time.
As always, it's great having
a conversation with you.
Thank you very much for being
on the Future of Business today.
DOUG MCMILLON: Thanks
for inviting me.
Great to see you, Adi.
Take care.
ADI IGNATIUS: All right.
