Hi
 everyone,
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangan,
 the


CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 Southern
 Wealth


Fund
 and
 today
 I'm
 joined
 by
 Bill


Winters,
 the
 group
 CEO
 of
 Standard


Charter
 Bank,
 one
 of
 the
 world's
 most


distinctive
 banks
 headquartered
 in


London.
 You
 have
 most
 of
 your
 activities


in
 Asia,
 Africa,
 and
 the
 Middle
 East.


And
 we
 own
 more
 than
 2%
 of
 the
 company


worth
 a
 billion
 dollars.
 We
 are
 really


proud
 shareholders.
 So,
 Bill,
 um,
 the


bank
 opened
 its
 first
 offices
 far
 away


in
 Mumbai,
 Kolkata,
 and
 Shanghai
 in


1853.


Long
 time
 ago,
 and
 you've
 been
 CEO
 in,


uh,
 for
 10
 years,
 which
 is
 only
 5%
 of


the


>> That's
 right.


>> of
 the
 duration
 of
 the
 bank.
 So,
 tell
 us


what
 is
 it
 that
 makes
 Standard
 Charter


so
 special?


>> Yeah,
 first
 it's
 great
 to
 be
 here.


Thanks
 for
 having
 me.
 Uh,
 so
 you're


right.
 Standard
 chart
 actually
 started


as
 a
 standard
 bank
 of
 Africa.
 It
 was


started
 in
 in
 Port
 Elizabeth
 in
 South


Africa.
 today
 South
 Africa
 and
 uh
 and


the
 charter
 bank
 of
 India,
 China
 and


Australia
 which
 first
 branch
 in
 Kolkata


and
 obviously
 at
 the
 outset
 it
 was


two
 banks
 it
 only
 came
 together
 in
 1969


still
 a
 long
 time
 ago
 uh
 but
 to
 finance


the
 empire
 it
 was
 to
 finance
 trade


within
 the
 empire


>> and
 those
 are
 still
 our
 roots
 and
 people


sometimes
 refer
 to
 us
 as
 an
 emerging


markets
 bank
 that's
 not
 quite
 right


because
 we
 have
 big
 operations
 in
 the
 US


and
 Europe
 and
 I'm
 not
 sure
 that
 places


like
 Hong
 Kong
 and
 Singapore
 are
 are


emerging
 markets
 anymore
 in
 any


U
 or
 they
 refer
 to
 us
 as
 a
 trade
 bank


which
 is
 true.
 We
 are
 a
 trade
 bank
 and


and
 the
 second
 largest
 trade
 bank
 in
 in


Asia
 of
 course
 which
 is
 the
 biggest


trading
 center
 of
 the
 world


>> but
 uh
 really
 we're
 a
 connector
 bank
 uh


we
 just
 connect
 markets
 to
 markets
 and


people
 to
 people
 because
 we
 have


multiple
 home
 markets
 and
 what
 attracted


me
 to
 standard
 chartered
 was
 the
 this


unique
 culture
 of
 of
 being
 a
 connector


uh
 with
 no
 single
 home
 market
 that
 of


course
 the
 UK
 is
 our
 home
 market
 in
 many


ways
 is
 where
 we
 started
 and
 where
 we're


headquartered.
 Uh,
 Hong
 Kong
 is
 our


biggest
 single
 market.
 Hong
 Kong,
 China,


which
 is
 increasingly
 a
 single
 market,


is
 is
 our
 by
 far
 our
 biggest
 profit


source.
 Singapore
 is
 our
 major


operational
 hub.
 India
 is
 our
 operation


center.
 And
 then
 we're
 a
 big
 bank
 in


India
 as
 well.


>> But
 who
 who
 are
 your
 clients
 then?


>> Our
 clients
 so
 roughly
 twothirds
 of
 our


businesses
 are
 our
 corporate
 and


institutional
 clients,
 including


governments.
 Uh,
 they're
 almost
 all


multinational.
 If
 they're
 not


multinational,
 they
 don't
 really
 need


us.
 And
 of
 course
 we
 can
 deal
 with
 some


local
 clients
 as
 well
 but
 but
 for
 the


most
 part
 they're
 multinational.
 They


have
 some
 crossber
 nexus.
 One-third
 is


retail.
 Uh
 all
 of
 the
 retail
 is
 Asia


Middle
 East
 and
 Africa
 but
 the
 corporate


is
 is
 truly
 global
 and
 uh
 and
 the


clients
 use
 us
 to
 connect
 them
 to


markets
 and
 investments.


>> Why
 are
 you
 still
 headquartered
 here?


You
 got
 all
 your
 activities
 so
 far
 away.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 question.
 It's
 a


good
 question
 and
 we
 ask


>> it's
 not
 the
 first
 time
 you
 got
 it


either.


>> No,
 not
 the
 first
 time.
 Uh
 do
 you
 know


what?
 So,
 so
 when
 we
 when
 we
 reflect
 on


this
 from
 time
 to
 time,
 we
 say
 first
 of


all
 uh
 we're
 we're
 quite
 quite
 a
 complex


bank,
 difficult
 to
 regulate
 and
 uh
 the


UK
 regulators
 are
 extremely


sophisticated.
 So
 they
 they
 they've
 been


managing
 global
 banks
 for
 a
 long
 time.


>> Uh
 so
 they
 especially
 for
 us
 we
 we
 deal


actively
 in
 financial
 markets,


derivatives
 and
 things
 like
 that
 that


are
 quite
 difficult
 to
 regulate


actually.
 So
 the
 P
 Bank
 of
 England
 is


extremely
 sophisticated.


>> Uh
 second
 it's
 the
 UK
 has
 always
 been
 a


a
 fantastic
 financial
 center.
 So
 it's


it's
 got
 the
 underlying
 infrastructure.


It
 obviously
 is
 a
 good
 time
 zone
 because


we're
 we're
 active
 throughout
 Africa
 and


in
 the
 west
 Europe
 and
 Americas
 where


where
 the
 UK
 is
 fine.


>> Um
 but
 you
 know
 our
 name
 is
 on
 the


banknotes
 in
 Hong
 Kong.
 Uh
 our
 largest


shareholder
 is
 Tomasc
 in
 Singapore.


>> Um
 we
 don't
 ever
 have
 want
 have
 to


choose
 between
 the
 two
 of
 them.
 Uh
 so


that's
 and
 you
 can
 think
 about
 some
 some


other
 location.
 Uh
 today
 Singapore
 and


Hong
 Kong
 could
 regulate
 us
 uh
 because


they've
 become
 extremely
 sophisticated


regulators
 as
 well.
 20
 years
 ago,
 I'm


not
 sure
 they
 could,
 but
 in
 the


meantime,
 we
 were
 we're
 firmly


entrenched
 here.


>> So
 now
 I'm
 I'm
 an
 international
 company


uh
 and
 I've
 got
 businesses
 in
 all
 these


places.
 What
 do
 you
 do
 for
 me?


>> We
 take
 care
 of
 your
 your
 local


operations,
 financing
 for
 your
 local


operations
 in
 countries
 where
 in
 some


cases
 we'll
 be
 the
 only
 bank
 that
 you


could
 deal
 with.
 in
 others
 will
 be
 one


one
 of
 the
 few
 international
 banks


that's
 truly
 local.


>> Uh
 so
 we're
 going
 to
 take
 care
 of
 your


business
 in
 those
 local
 markets.
 Uh


we're
 also
 going
 to
 connect
 you
 to
 local


players
 who
 may
 be
 part
 of
 your
 supply


chain
 or
 they
 may
 be
 your
 distributors


or
 they
 may
 be
 your
 partners
 or
 one
 day


they
 may
 buy
 you
 or
 or
 buy
 part
 of
 you.


Uh
 so
 that's
 for
 the
 multinational


companies.
 We're
 offering
 them
 access
 to


these
 local
 markets.


>> When
 you
 took
 over
 the
 bank
 10
 years
 ago


uh
 the
 state
 of
 affairs
 were
 very


different.
 What
 did
 things
 look
 like


back
 then?
 You
 know,
 I
 I
 had
 I
 had
 left


banking
 at
 that
 point.
 I
 had
 worked
 at


JP
 Morgan.
 I
 I
 was
 I
 had
 set
 up
 a
 what


today
 we
 would
 call
 a
 private
 credit


fund.
 Then
 we
 just
 called
 it
 an
 asset


manager.
 Uh
 it
 was
 fine.
 It
 was
 a
 good


life.
 You
 know,
 the
 asset
 management


life
 is
 a
 good
 life.
 Uh


>> not
 always,
 but
 some


>> I'm
 going
 to
 say
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 it's
 a


good
 life.
 That's
 how
 I
 remember
 it.
 And


uh
 and
 then
 I
 got
 this
 call
 from
 Sander


Charter.
 I
 knew
 the
 bank
 pretty
 well


from
 my
 time
 at
 JP
 Morgan
 because


Standard
 Charter
 was
 a
 client
 and
 a


partner


>> that
 we're
 still
 clients
 and
 partners.


Uh
 and
 the
 chairman
 said,
 "We've
 got
 a


problem."
 Uh
 I
 said,
 "Yeah,
 I'm
 aware


that
 there
 are
 some
 problems.
 Uh
 but
 he


said,
 'I
 think
 we've
 got
 a
 really
 good


underlying
 franchise
 and
 we
 just
 need
 to


clean
 it
 up."
 And
 and
 the
 problems
 that


they
 were
 very
 clear
 at
 that
 point
 were


were
 compliance
 problems
 largely
 with


the
 US,
 but
 also
 with
 the
 UK
 and


elsewhere.
 Uh
 but
 it
 was
 also
 clear
 that


there
 were
 some
 credit
 problems.
 Uh
 I


don't
 think
 anybody
 was
 aware
 how


substantial
 the
 problems
 were,
 and
 I


wasn't
 uh
 when
 I
 arrived,
 I
 have
 to


confess
 despite
 my
 due
 diligence.


>> How
 how
 bad
 were
 they?
 We
 wrote
 off
 a


quarter
 of
 the
 book
 equity
 of
 the
 bank


and
 and
 had
 to
 fill
 that
 up
 with
 the


rights
 offering
 uh
 which,
 you
 know,
 took


the
 share
 price
 down.
 It
 had
 it
 had


peaked
 at,
 you
 know,
 almost
 double
 the


price
 that
 it
 was
 at
 when
 I
 was


announced,
 but
 it
 it
 dropped
 by
 another


half
 uh
 again.
 So
 that's
 now
 75%
 down.


Peaked
 drop.
 So
 that's
 um
 yeah,
 but
 my


the
 bet
 I
 made
 uh
 which
 I
 I
 questioned


at
 a
 few
 points,
 but
 I
 fundamentally
 I'm


sure
 today
 was
 right
 was
 that
 there
 was


a
 really
 good
 underlying
 franchise
 with


a
 really
 interesting
 and
 thank
 you
 for


calling
 this
 distinct
 at
 the
 outset.


That's
 a
 it's
 a
 neutral
 term.
 It
 could


be
 distinctively
 positive
 or
 negative,


but
 it
 is
 in
 fact
 distinct.
 And


>> it's
 a
 positive
 now.


>> It
 is
 a
 positive
 now.
 And
 and
 people


have
 wondered
 at
 times
 whether
 it
 is
 a


positive
 because
 sometimes
 it's


expensive
 to
 be
 distinct.


>> Uh
 or
 it's
 tough
 to
 get
 to
 scale
 when


you're
 distinct.
 But
 uh
 I
 I
 took
 the


view
 that
 we
 were
 distinctive
 and
 that


that
 distinction
 was
 a
 strength
 and
 that


we
 could
 leverage
 that
 strength
 and
 that


we
 just
 had
 some
 problems
 that
 we
 had
 to


clean
 up.


>> So So
 first
 day
 in
 the
 office,
 you
 come


in
 there
 and
 you
 say,
 "Hi
 guys,
 Bill


Winter.
 I'm
 uh
 you
 know
 coming
 to
 save


you
 and
 let's
 have
 a
 look
 at
 the
 books.


Wow,
 not
 so
 good.
 Uh
 write
 off
 a
 quarter


of
 that.
 Uh
 have
 to
 take
 in
 some
 new


capital.
 Just
 how
 do
 you
 go
 about
 fixing


something
 which
 is
 so
 big
 and
 complex?


>> We
 took
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 time.
 We
 took
 I


I
 had
 the
 luxury
 first
 of
 all
 of
 having


three
 months
 between
 the
 time
 that
 I
 was


announced
 and
 the
 time
 that
 I
 started.


So
 I
 was
 just
 an
 observer.
 I
 was
 also


selling
 as
 it
 happens
 my
 my
 previous


business.
 uh
 I
 was
 on
 the
 board
 of
 some


other
 companies
 that
 I
 had
 to
 step
 off.


So
 it
 took
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 time
 to


transition
 uh
 which
 was
 which
 gave
 me
 a


chance
 to
 understand
 without
 having
 to


make
 decisions.
 Uh
 so
 by
 the
 time
 I


started
 3
 months
 after
 announcement
 uh
 I


was
 pretty
 familiar
 with
 the
 bank
 and
 we


could
 get
 right
 down
 to
 to
 business.
 You


know
 the
 first
 order
 was
 to
 was
 to
 pick


the
 team
 uh
 actually
 but
 even
 before
 we


dealt
 with
 the
 problems
 and
 uh
 we
 you


there's
 one
 person
 that
 had
 been
 on
 the


previous
 executive
 team
 that
 we
 carried


over
 uh
 about
 half
 the
 people
 that
 that


formed
 the
 core
 team
 at
 the
 outset
 came


from
 inside
 but
 we
 bumped
 them
 up
 an


organizational
 level
 or
 two
 and
 the


other
 half
 came
 from
 outside.
 Took
 a


little
 bit
 of
 time.


>> During
 those
 three
 months
 how
 many


people
 did
 you
 meet
 with?


>> Oh
 hundreds.
 Hundreds
 and


>> working
 inside
 the
 bank
 and
 meeting


people.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 you
 know,
 I
 was
 in
 almost


every
 day
 and
 I
 and
 I
 took
 uh
 you
 weeks


on
 the
 road
 to
 to
 go
 visit
 the
 the
 key


centers
 in
 Hong
 Kong,
 Singapore,
 Dubai,


uh
 Seoul.


>> And
 how
 do
 you
 and
 how
 do
 you
 pick
 the


people?
 How
 do
 you
 see
 who
 is
 fit?


>> I
 you
 know,
 when
 when
 I
 reflect
 back
 on


that
 on
 that
 period,
 uh
 I
 didn't
 have
 a


100%
 success
 rate,
 but
 it
 was
 I'm
 I'm


surprised
 that
 the
 initial
 instincts


were
 as
 correct
 as
 they
 seemed.
 What


what


>> what
 were
 you
 looking
 for?


>> I
 I
 was
 first
 and
 foremost
 was
 looking


for
 integrity.
 uh
 you
 know
 there
 had


been
 I
 would
 say
 very
 substantial


control
 lapses
 in
 the
 company.
 It
 wasn't


completely
 clear
 whether
 all
 those


control
 lapses
 were
 completely
 honest


and
 uh
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 evidence


that
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 dishonesty
 but


there
 were
 some
 bad
 examples
 of


selfserving
 behavior
 I
 thought
 and
 that


had
 got
 I
 think
 that
 contributed
 a
 lot


to
 to
 the
 state
 of
 the
 company
 at
 the


time
 and
 I
 wanted
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 that


we
 had
 a
 team
 that
 was
 completely


focused
 on
 the
 team
 and
 not
 focused
 on


themselves.


>> How
 many
 people
 did
 you
 bring
 in
 from


the
 outside?


>> Right.
 the
 the
 the
 first
 hire
 from
 the


outside
 was
 a
 chief
 risk
 officer
 and


which
 was
 a
 really
 natural
 place
 to


start.
 Uh
 it
 brought
 in
 a
 the
 head
 of


our
 corporate
 bank
 came
 from
 outside


whereas
 the
 head
 of
 our
 retail
 bank
 I


promoted
 from
 within.
 Uh
 the
 bank


actually
 had
 just
 hired
 a
 new
 CFO
 before


I
 arrived
 uh
 who
 had
 had
 a
 very


experienced
 CFO
 from
 Vodafone
 uh
 who


obviously
 stayed
 and
 the
 had
 just
 hired


a
 general
 counsel
 to
 clean
 basically
 to


clean
 up
 some
 of
 the
 mess
 with
 with
 the


US
 authorities
 in
 particular
 who's
 also


very
 strong.
 So,
 so
 we
 had
 you
 know
 we


had
 some
 good
 endowments
 uh
 at
 the


outset.
 Uh
 and
 in
 fact
 the
 bank
 had
 just


hired
 a
 head
 of
 technology
 and


operations
 who
 started
 the
 same
 day
 same


day
 I
 did.


But
 you
 what
 I
 found
 was
 that
 the
 talent


in
 the
 bank
 was
 actually
 very
 very
 good


and
 much
 of
 it
 long-
 serving
 and
 they


understood
 what
 was
 really
 good
 about


center
 charter
 and
 what
 was
 not.
 But
 I


also
 realized
 that
 that that
 group
 of


people
 was
 they
 were
 shell
 shocked


because
 I
 mean
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 the


history
 center
 charter
 was
 just
 three


years
 earlier
 they
 were
 the
 darling
 of


the
 city
 uh
 trading
 at
 a
 multiple
 of


their
 book
 value
 and
 uh
 had
 subsequently


dropped
 down
 to
 something
 around
 book


value
 that
 subsequently
 fell
 down
 to
 30%


of
 book
 value
 but
 that
 in
 2012
 they
 were


heroes
 and
 and
 told
 that
 they
 were
 great


and
 you
 know
 very
 big
 investors


came
 in
 and
 put
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 with
 the


at
 a
 very
 high
 price
 saying
 you
 guys
 are


great
 and
 you're


>> including
 us.


>> I
 don't
 think
 so.
 I
 think
 you
 were
 much


much much
 more
 astute
 at
 the
 time
 but
 uh


no
 notice
 was
 was
 was
 involved
 but
 I


don't
 think
 outsized
 at
 the
 time.


>> When
 you
 come
 in
 there
 and
 the
 bank
 is


in
 trouble
 and
 you're
 like
 a
 fallen
 star


and
 you're
 a
 new
 person,
 what
 how
 do
 you


communicate
 with
 shareholders?


>> What's
 the
 what
 are
 the
 key
 what
 are
 the


key
 things
 and
 key
 messages?


>> You
 know
 the
 very
 first
 and
 most


important
 communicators
 were
 with


regulators
 because
 the
 bank
 had
 lost
 the


confidence
 of
 of
 regulators,


>> right?
 And
 uh
 so
 my
 my
 first


interactions
 were
 just
 to
 to
 be
 be
 very


clear
 that
 that
 the
 regulators
 actually


were
 the
 very
 single
 number
 one
 priority


even
 at
 the
 expense
 of
 shareholders
 not


because
 that
 can
 sustain
 for
 any
 period


of
 time
 but
 because
 that
 was
 necessary


for
 existence
 at
 that
 point.


>> Stupid
 question.
 Why
 is
 it
 important
 to


be
 friends
 with
 the
 regulators?


>> Because
 regulators
 give
 you
 a
 license
 to


operate
 and
 without
 the
 the
 support
 of


the
 of
 the
 regulator
 you
 can't
 operate.


uh
 you
 know
 there
 there
 were
 there
 were


questions
 back
 in
 2012
 when
 standard


charter
 was
 first
 uh
 identified
 as


having
 violated
 some
 of
 the
 financial


crime
 rules
 in
 in
 the
 US.
 There
 was
 a


question
 whether
 the
 US
 would
 would


remove
 our
 banking
 license.
 Uh
 I
 don't


know
 how
 close
 that
 ever
 came
 but
 it
 was


certainly
 considered
 and


>> and
 a
 bank
 without
 a
 banking
 license


that's
 not
 a
 good
 place
 to
 be.


>> It
 doesn't
 exist.


>> It
 doesn't
 exist.
 uh
 not
 necessarily
 in


every
 country,
 but
 if
 that
 country
 is


the
 United
 States
 and
 you're
 one
 of the


largest
 clearers
 of
 US
 dollars
 and
 that


means
 you
 can
 no
 longer
 clear
 US


dollars,
 it's
 it's
 as
 essential.
 So,


>> but
 but
 how
 do
 you
 communicate
 with


shareholders
 when
 just
 what
 do
 you
 what


do
 you
 tell
 them?
 Do
 you
 tell
 them
 your


dreams
 or
 your
 plans
 or
 your
 specific


targets?
 Just
 how
 do
 you


>> I
 started
 by
 I
 I
 so
 I
 gave
 shareholders


my
 assessment
 of
 why
 I
 took
 the
 job.
 And


it
 it
 was
 pretty
 clear
 I
 think
 to


anybody
 I
 was
 speaking
 to
 that
 I
 didn't


have
 to
 take
 that
 job.
 uh
 I
 wasn't
 an


internal
 person
 that
 was
 that
 was


brought
 into
 you
 know
 to
 to
 carry
 on.
 I


was
 I
 I
 I
 dropped
 a
 really
 nice


comfortable
 life
 outside
 to
 go
 do


something
 new.
 Uh
 and
 I
 explained
 why


and
 I
 explained
 that
 I
 thought
 that
 the


underlying
 franchise
 was
 a
 super


franchise
 that
 we
 had
 some
 problems
 that


we
 could
 fix
 them.


>> I
 had
 been
 at
 JP
 Morgan
 uh
 at
 the
 time


that
 JP
 Morgan
 sold
 itself
 to
 Chase.
 Uh


that
 bank
 JP
 Morgan
 Chase
 which
 is
 hard


to
 imagine
 today
 given
 how
 powerful
 that


bank
 is.
 That
 bank
 had
 had
 a
 really


difficult
 time
 in
 2001
 on
 the
 back
 of


the
 the
 bankruptcy
 of
 Enron
 and
 and


WorldCom
 and
 and
 other
 associated


failures
 during
 that
 you
 know
 the
 dotcom


bust
 and
 and
 other
 things
 and
 uh
 we
 as
 a


team
 pulled
 together
 and
 fixed
 that
 bank


you
 know
 Jamie
 then
 came
 in
 four
 years


later
 I
 guess
 and
 and
 then
 continue
 to


fix
 the
 bank
 and
 obviously
 has
 taken
 it


on
 to
 to
 what
 it
 is
 today.
 Uh
 so
 I
 had


some
 experience
 with
 really
 bad


situations
 with
 really
 bad
 relationships


with
 regulators


>> that
 had
 worked
 out
 really
 well
 for


shareholders
 and
 I
 tried
 to
 play
 on
 that


history.


>> When
 did
 you
 first
 start
 to
 think
 that


everything
 hey
 now
 things
 are
 going
 well


we
 sorted
 it


>> well
 but
 you
 know
 interesting
 when
 I


thought
 things
 were
 going
 well
 was
 a


little
 bit
 different
 than
 when
 the


market
 thought
 things
 were
 going
 well.


So
 uh
 we
 we
 took
 you
 know
 really
 severe


medicine
 in
 2015
 and
 16
 both
 management


and
 and
 and
 sure
 you
 financial
 uh
 I


think
 17
 and
 18
 were
 definitely


rebuilding
 years.
 We
 also
 had
 a
 big


technical
 deficit
 so
 technology
 gaps


obsolescence
 that
 needed
 to
 be
 closed.


I
 was
 feeling
 very
 good
 about
 things
 in


2019
 and
 we
 had
 set
 at
 the
 outset
 uh


three-year
 performance
 targets
 as
 as as


we
 all
 do
 and
 you
 know
 performance
 plans


were
 linked
 to
 that
 so
 it
 was
 all
 public


and
 um
 you
 know
 the
 the
 big
 delivery


year
 was
 going to
 be
 2019
 as
 it
 happens


we
 fell
 a
 little
 bit
 short
 of
 the


targets
 in
 2019
 largely
 because
 interest


rates
 had
 had
 fallen
 relative
 to
 what
 we


expected
 but
 we
 were
 on
 track
 and
 so
 so


2020
 was
 going
 to
 be
 the
 delivery
 year


>> uh
 that
 was
 not
 reflected
 in
 the
 market


at
 all
 for
 us
 at
 that
 point
 um
 not
 long


enough
 to
 be
 too
 frustrated.
 We
 know


what
 we
 know
 what
 happened
 in
 2020
 with


with
 COVID
 and
 interest
 rates
 going
 to


zero
 uh
 which
 is
 very
 bad
 for
 any
 bank.


It's
 it
 was
 particularly
 bad
 for
 our


bank
 at
 that
 point.
 So
 for
 two
 years
 we


had
 to
 kind
 of
 tread
 water
 uh
 with


continued
 to
 progress
 but
 but
 it
 was
 not


very
 visible.
 Uh
 so
 I
 felt
 things
 were


in
 in
 good
 in
 good
 nick
 in
 2019
 but
 I


don't
 think
 the
 market
 finally
 came


around
 to
 that
 view
 until
 probably
 2022


or
 23.
 what
 took
 it
 so
 long


>> covid
 was
 two
 years
 uh
 we
 had
 a


credibility
 gap
 uh
 which
 I
 think
 was
 the


credibility
 gap
 that
 came
 from
 the


problems
 in
 2014
 15
 16
 uh
 we're


relatively
 small
 uh
 so
 that
 not
 every


investor
 has
 to
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time


understanding
 a
 relatively
 complex
 bank


like
 center
 charters
 and
 uh
 so
 I
 think


there
 there's
 a
 very
 wise
 uh
 sharehold


well
 actually
 non-shareholder
 but
 a


portfolio
 manager
 a
 very
 large
 asset


manager
 who
 said
 you
 know
 the
 way
 this


is
 going to
 work
 is
 you're
 going
 to
 have


to
 outperform
 form
 for
 2
 or
 3
 years


before
 anybody
 really
 pays
 attention
 and


then
 people
 will
 crowd
 in.
 And
 I
 thought


and
 he
 probably
 said
 that
 to
 me
 in
 2018.


I
 thought
 that
 was
 a
 a
 little
 bit


histrionic
 at
 the
 time.
 It
 turns
 out
 I


think
 he
 was
 he
 was
 exactly
 correct


which
 you
 know
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 would


necessarily
 be
 the
 same
 if
 it
 was
 a
 much


bigger
 bank
 even
 a
 bank
 like
 HSBC
 much


bigger
 than
 us.
 Similar
 kind
 of
 business


profile
 but
 they're
 in
 the
 indices


they're
 in
 all
 the
 indices.
 uh
 you
 can't


not
 own
 HSBC
 or
 if
 you
 don't
 own
 HSBC


you
 have
 to
 be
 very
 aware
 that
 you
 don't


you
 cannot
 own
 it
 standard
 chartered
 and


it's
 not
 going
 to
 fundamentally
 change


your
 your
 portfolio.


>> If
 you
 were
 to
 take
 over
 a
 bank
 in
 the


same
 situation
 again
 what
 would
 you
 do


differently?


>> But
 the
 biggest
 mistake
 I
 made
 and
 it


was
 a
 big
 one
 was
 to
 not
 realize
 that


the
 risk
 appetite
 inside
 the
 bank
 had


already
 collapsed
 before
 I
 arrived.
 So
 I


showed
 up
 on
 day
 one.
 I
 saw
 many


indicators
 of
 of
 loose
 controls
 on
 the


compliance
 side,
 on
 the
 conduct
 side,


and
 then
 on
 the
 financial
 side.
 So,


credit
 losses.
 Uh,
 and
 I
 hit
 the
 brakes


hard.
 Uh,
 and
 that
 was
 I
 overdid
 it.
 Uh,


and
 I
 overdid
 it
 because
 I
 acted
 before


I
 be
 before
 I
 investigated.
 So,
 you
 the


indicators
 were
 very
 negative.
 And,
 uh,


so
 I
 said,
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 you're
 out


of
 control.
 Basically,
 you
 can't
 do


anything
 without
 my
 approval
 for
 a


little
 while.
 And


>> and
 they
 were
 already
 scared
 to
 death.


>> But
 they
 were
 already
 scared
 to
 death.


and
 and
 they
 had
 been
 scared
 to
 death


for
 six
 months.
 So
 So
 you
 know
 the


balance
 sheet
 shrunk
 by
 the
 better
 part


of
 a
 third
 in
 my
 first
 year.
 Probably


half
 of
 that
 was
 unnecessary.
 I
 I
 may
 be


a
 little
 bit
 harsh
 on
 myself
 on
 that


one,
 but
 but
 I
 I
 I
 think
 I
 I
 over
 I


overindulged
 on
 the
 uh
 the
 risk


messaging
 and
 and
 maybe
 even
 more


harmful
 than
 the
 damage
 that
 I
 did
 in


the
 short
 term
 was
 that
 it
 meant
 it
 was


that
 much
 harder
 to
 get
 out
 of
 that
 that


risk
 averse
 position.
 Um,
 what
 were
 the


most
 important
 things
 that
 you
 took
 from


your
 time
 at
 JP
 Morgan
 to
 bring
 into


this
 bank?


>> You
 know,
 JP
 Morgan
 was
 was
 several


different
 banks
 in
 my
 time
 there.
 I


started
 there
 in
 1983.
 It
 was
 a
 US


commercial
 bank,
 but
 but
 very
 a
 very


preeminent
 US
 commercial
 bank,
 but
 a


commercial
 bank.
 And
 then
 Morgan
 Stanley


and
 Goldman
 Sachs
 were
 these
 other


things
 that
 we
 just
 heard
 about.
 Uh,


shortly
 after
 I
 arrived,
 Lou
 Preston,


legendary
 leader
 of
 of
 JP
 Morgan,
 who


went
 on
 to
 run
 the
 World
 Bank,
 said,
 you


know,
 we've
 got
 to
 make
 a
 decision.
 Do


we
 follow
 our
 clients
 into
 the
 products


that
 they're
 pursuing
 or
 do
 we
 follow


our
 products
 into
 a
 new
 group
 of
 clients


and
 that
 was
 because
 the
 our
 clients


were
 going
 into
 capital
 markets
 uh
 which


we
 as
 a
 US
 commercial
 bank
 were
 unable


to
 access
 because
 of
 the
 glass
 act
 and


Preston
 said
 prophetically
 we
 will


follow
 our
 clients
 and
 therefore
 we
 need


a
 new
 set
 of
 products.
 So
 we
 developed


some
 conventional
 investment
 banking


products
 like
 debt
 and
 equity
 capital


markets
 first
 debt
 then
 equity
 u
 but


then
 also
 gave
 ourselves
 license
 to
 get


into
 some
 new
 areas
 like
 the
 very
 early


days
 of
 the
 derivative
 markets.
 So
 my


the
 first
 big
 lesson
 was
 you
 ask


yourself
 the
 question
 why
 are
 you
 there?


Are
 you
 there
 to
 serve
 your
 clients
 or


are
 you
 there
 to
 push
 products?


>> The
 answer
 the
 right
 answer
 is
 almost


always
 serve
 your
 clients
 but
 but


perhaps
 in
 some
 cases
 it's
 not.
 Uh


second
 was
 and
 this
 the
 huge
 lesson
 for


me
 was
 I
 just
 got
 very
 lucky
 and
 got
 got


put
 into
 this
 derivative
 area
 or
 swaps


as
 we
 called
 it
 in
 1987
 when
 it
 was
 just


getting
 started
 and
 I
 rode
 that
 wave
 for


the
 next
 25
 years
 uh
 as
 a
 and
 it
 it
 gave


me
 an
 opportunity
 in
 in
 the
 outset
 in


sort
 of
 the
 back
 room
 in
 the
 in
 the
 dark


the
 dark
 room
 that
 nobody
 paid
 too
 much


attention
 to
 to
 innovate
 and
 create
 and


then
 later
 to
 industrialize
 something


that
 started
 from
 an
 innovative
 process.


the
 most
 fabulous
 learning
 experience
 of


my
 life.
 I
 was
 just
 I
 was
 just
 you
 know


how
 things
 happen
 just
 a
 confluence
 of


of
 things
 and
 events
 that
 allowed
 me
 to


glom
 onto
 that
 at
 that
 point
 and
 and


just
 ride
 that
 wave.
 But
 we
 did
 some
 we


did
 some
 really
 interesting
 things
 at
 JP


Morgan
 and
 you
 know
 maybe
 the
 we
 then


sold
 the
 company
 to
 Chase
 that
 cleanup


was
 absolutely
 fascinating.
 Uh
 you
 know


I
 I
 can
 blame
 us
 for
 having
 done
 very


bad
 due
 diligence
 at
 the
 time
 that
 we


sold
 the
 company
 because
 we
 sold
 the


company
 at
 a
 huge
 premium
 to
 a
 company


whose
 stock
 was
 hugely
 overvalued
 as
 it


turned
 out.
 It's
 okay.
 Like
 as
 as
 you


see
 today
 with
 JP
 Morgan
 Chase,
 it


worked
 out.
 Uh
 but
 there
 it
 was
 a
 very


bumpy
 road,
 but
 that
 cleanup
 process
 was


fascinating.
 Uh
 and
 then
 Jamie
 came
 and


you
 know,
 I
 learned
 as
 much
 from
 Jamie


as
 I've
 learned
 from
 anybody
 in
 my


working
 life.
 He's
 just
 a
 highly


disciplined,
 very
 focused
 manager.
 And


we
 didn't
 always
 get
 along
 uh
 for
 sure.


And
 uh
 and
 it
 didn't
 end
 well
 my


relationship
 with
 Jamie
 at
 JP
 Morgan,


but
 it's
 end
 it's
 carried
 on
 very
 well.


I
 mean,
 I
 would
 put
 I
 put
 him
 in
 the


category
 of
 good
 friends.
 uh
 to
 this
 day


despite
 the
 bumps
 we
 had
 along
 the
 road.


He's
 a
 fabulous
 manager.


>> How
 would
 you
 define
 your
 leadership


style?


>> I
 would
 define
 my
 leadership
 style
 as
 as


very
 collaborative.
 Uh
 I'm
 uh
 not


particularly
 directive.
 I
 mean,
 I
 can


get
 deeply
 into
 the
 details
 if
 I
 need


to,
 but
 I
 would
 prefer
 not
 to.
 I'd


prefer
 that
 the
 people
 that
 are
 that
 are


working
 for
 me
 are
 really
 taking
 care
 of


the
 details
 themselves.
 I
 try
 to
 push


accountability
 down
 at
 every


opportunity.
 uh
 I
 try
 to
 create
 a
 team


that
 is
 a
 team
 rather
 than
 a
 team
 that


has
 a
 series
 of
 bilateral
 relationships


with
 me.
 Uh
 I
 probably
 some
 would
 say


that
 I
 overindex
 optionality
 so
 that


that
 that
 I'm
 I
 that
 I
 carry
 too
 many


options
 uh
 at
 too
 high
 a
 carry
 cost.


Some
 would
 say
 that
 others
 would
 say
 the


fact
 that
 you're
 prepared
 to
 back
 non


sure
 things
 is
 what
 has
 changed
 the


organizations
 for
 the
 better
 that
 you


work
 for
 over
 the
 years.
 Uh
 I
 would


accept
 that
 I
 I
 probably
 overindex


optionality.
 I
 unbiased
 on
 balance.
 I


think
 that's
 a
 good
 thing.
 Uh
 but
 that


that's
 probably
 the
 most
 controversial


of
 the
 things
 that
 are
 attributed
 to
 my


leadership
 style.


>> Some
 people
 say
 I
 just
 can't
 make
 a


decision
 sometimes.


>> And
 what
 would
 you
 say?


>> I
 say
 I
 love
 optionality
 and
 I'll
 make
 a


decision
 when
 it's
 the
 right
 right
 time


to
 either
 exercise,
 sell
 or
 shut
 down


that
 option.


>> Yeah.
 Optionality
 is
 often
 um


underpriced
 and
 worth
 a
 lot
 sometimes.


>> Sometimes.
 How
 do
 you
 read
 today's


world?


>> Uh
 it's
 it's
 obviously
 super
 tense
 today


and
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 wake
 up
 each
 morning


wondering
 what
 happened
 overnight
 in


China
 or
 or
 or
 in
 Asia
 or
 depending
 on


where
 I'm
 sitting
 and
 I
 go
 to
 bed
 each


night
 wondering
 what's
 going
 to
 happen


when
 I
 sleep.
 And
 you
 know
 what
 we
 find


in
 the
 between
 dawn
 and
 dusk
 is
 things


are
 going
 pretty
 well.
 So
 uh
 I
 happened


to
 be
 in
 Vietnam
 on
 April
 2nd
 and
 I
 had


met
 with
 the
 prime
 minister
 uh
 on
 the


evening
 of
 the
 first
 and
 then
 uh
 or
 at


the
 evening
 of
 second
 actually
 and
 then


woke
 up
 to
 find
 this
 you
 the
 Vietnam
 was


at
 46%
 on
 the
 on
 the
 tariff
 chart.
 We
 we


were
 all
 remember
 the
 tariff
 chart


>> and


>> so
 this
 was
 a
 liberation
 day
 where
 they


introduced


>> that
 was
 the
 day
 the
 tariffs
 were


introduced


>> and
 uh
 I
 had
 said
 to
 the
 prime
 minister


the
 night
 before
 uh
 I
 don't
 know
 what's


going
 to
 come
 today
 in
 this
 press


conference
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 need
 to


worry
 because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 I


don't
 think
 the
 president
 of
 the
 United


States
 is
 really
 keen
 to
 trash
 his


economy
 and
 uh
 then
 the
 46%
 number
 came


out
 and
 and
 I
 met
 with
 him
 in
 the


finance
 minister
 the
 next
 morning
 and
 he


said
 what
 kind
 of
 advice
 was
 that
 you


gave
 me
 last
 night
 because
 we're
 worried


here
 today
 I
 said
 I'm
 Well,
 I'm
 a
 little


bit
 more
 worried
 than
 I
 was
 yesterday


because
 it
 was
 quite
 dramatic
 this
 whole


thing.
 But
 uh
 but
 I
 still
 don't
 think


you
 need
 to
 worry
 because
 I
 really
 don't


think
 that
 the
 United
 States
 wants
 to


destroy
 its
 own
 economy
 through


inflation
 or
 or
 through
 uh
 through
 uh


suppressed
 economic
 activity.
 So
 what


what
 I
 would
 suggest
 is
 that
 you


identify
 those
 things
 that
 are
 really


sensitive
 to
 the
 US.
 The
 obvious
 one
 for


you
 in
 Vietnam
 is
 is
 trans
 shipments.


you're
 you're
 a
 very
 large
 trans


shipment
 point
 or
 at least
 allegedly
 for


Chinese
 goods
 that
 are
 that
 are


basically
 stamped
 made
 in
 Vietnam
 on
 the


way
 through.
 Uh
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 make
 a


lot
 of
 money
 at
 that.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


a
 big
 employer
 of
 your
 people.
 It's
 just


a
 thing
 that
 you
 do.
 I
 think
 you
 could


probably
 focus
 on
 that
 and
 and
 and
 cut
 a


pretty
 good
 deal
 with
 the
 US
 on
 the
 way


back.
 Anyway,
 we
 we
 had
 the
 view
 that


tariffs
 would
 end
 up
 at
 10%
 for
 the


world,
 25%
 for
 China,
 and
 I
 will
 still


maintain
 that
 that
 I
 never
 change
 that


view.
 I
 would
 still
 maintain
 that's


where
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 once
 we've


factored
 in
 all
 the
 exemptions
 and
 the


new
 you
 know
 India
 has
 to
 cut
 the
 deal


etc.
 So
 uh
 if
 but
 if
 you
 take
 the
 view


that
 the
 US
 doesn't
 want
 to
 to
 engage
 in


self
 harm
 and
 China
 doesn't
 want
 to


engage
 in
 self
 harm
 but
 they're
 in
 an


intense
 competition
 that's
 going
 to


persist
 for
 my
 entire
 lifetime
 uh
 and


and
 beyond
 I
 suspect
 then
 uh
 you
 just


have
 to
 ride
 with
 with
 that
 tension


>> and
 you
 know
 what
 I
 reflect
 on
 more


broadly
 is
 that
 in
 the
 history
 of
 the


world
 we've
 never
 been
 at
 a
 time
 where


there
 was
 less
 major
 conflict
 than
 right


now.
 So,
 of
 course,
 you
 don't
 feel
 that


way
 if
 you're
 in
 Gaza
 or
 southern


Lebanon
 or
 Ukraine.
 Uh,
 but
 broadly,


this
 is
 a
 really
 peaceful
 time
 in
 the


world.
 And,
 uh,
 I'm
 hopeful
 that
 we
 can


sustain
 that.
 Uh,
 and
 I'm
 I'm
 hopeful


that
 it's
 fundamentally
 it's
 the


self-interest
 of
 the
 United
 States,


China,
 even
 Russia,
 uh,
 Europe
 as
 as
 the


major
 military
 powers
 in
 the
 world
 that


that
 continue.
 So,
 uh,


>> when
 you
 when
 you
 talk
 about
 resetting


globalization,
 what
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 that?


We
 mean
 uh
 enga
 extracting
 the
 benefits


of
 globalization
 without
 leaving
 key


parts
 of
 the
 population
 behind
 as
 we
 did


last
 time.
 Uh
 so
 we
 all
 know
 that


globalization
 was
 a
 tremendous
 enricher


and
 and
 generator
 of
 prosperity
 for


billions
 of
 people
 around
 the
 world.
 Uh


we
 also
 know
 that
 there
 were
 extremely


important
 chunks
 of
 the
 electorate
 in


democracies
 that
 were
 left
 behind
 as


their
 markets
 de-industrialized
 or


partially
 de-industrialized
 and
 hence
 we


get
 the
 the
 the
 populist
 backlash.
 So


resetting
 globalization
 and
 that's
 just


one
 example
 of
 of
 people
 that
 were


disenfranchised.
 I
 think
 there
 were
 also


you
 know
 incidents
 of
 human
 rights
 or


indigenous
 people
 abuses
 uh
 that
 came


with
 globalization.
 There
 was
 a
 a
 lack


of
 focus
 on
 on
 sustainability
 and
 and


and
 managing
 greenhouse
 gas
 emissions


that
 came
 with
 globalization.
 So


resetting
 globalization
 is
 is
 getting
 as


much
 of
 of
 the
 benefit
 that
 we
 have


always
 recognized
 from
 globalization


while
 taking
 maybe
 a
 slightly
 store


slower
 step
 from
 time
 to
 time
 uh
 to
 to


bring
 those
 other
 populations
 along.


>> Are
 we
 moving
 towards
 a
 word
 world
 with


um
 with
 separate
 financial
 systems?


>> I
 fear
 that
 we
 are
 uh
 although
 I
 think


there
 will
 be
 a
 big
 chunk
 of
 the
 world


that
 operates
 in
 both.
 So
 at
 the
 for
 the


time
 being
 the
 dollar
 is
 the
 dollar
 and


the
 Brettonwood
 system
 is
 still


preminent.


>> U
 China
 is
 is
 steadily
 building
 up
 a
 a


financial
 infrastructure
 that
 is
 an


alternative
 to
 the
 US
 dollar.
 I
 don't


think
 their
 objective
 is
 to
 displace
 the


dollar
 certainly
 not
 as
 a
 reserve


currency
 but
 I
 don't
 even
 think
 as
 a
 as


a
 currency
 of
 trade
 but
 they
 do
 want
 to


have
 a
 facility
 to
 continue
 trading
 if


their
 access
 to
 dollars
 is
 shut
 down.


And
 uh
 so
 whether
 it's
 the
 and
 and
 we


play
 very
 actively
 in
 both
 call
 it


financial
 systems
 they're
 completely


interoperable
 today
 but
 of
 course
 we


could
 imagine
 a
 time
 when
 they're


disintegrated


>> as
 Russia
 was
 disintegrated
 from
 from


the
 global
 financial
 system
 after
 they


invaded
 Ukraine.
 So
 so
 I
 fear
 we're


heading
 that
 direction
 bit
 by
 bit
 and
 I


fear
 we're
 heading
 the
 same
 direction
 in


technology
 and
 and
 underlying
 uh


technical
 infrastructure.
 But
 we've
 also


seen
 that
 that
 very
 important
 countries


in
 the
 world
 starting
 with
 with
 India,


Brazil,
 South
 Africa,
 the
 Middle
 East
 uh


aren't
 going
 to
 choose
 sides
 and
 I
 don't


think
 they
 can
 be
 compelled
 to
 choose


sides.
 Uh
 so
 they'll
 be
 operating
 in


both
 financial
 systems
 and
 as
 as
 soon
 as


as
 long
 as
 you
 have
 somebody
 in
 the


middle
 then
 you've
 got
 the
 bridge


between
 the
 two


>> which
 will
 render
 them
 interoperable


even
 if
 they're
 technically
 not


interoperable.


>> So
 um
 let's
 spend
 a
 minute
 on
 the
 big


regions
 where
 you
 operate.
 Uh
 and
 let's


start
 with
 China.
 How
 do
 you
 see
 the


longer
 term
 outlook
 for
 China?


>> Uh
 longer
 term,
 I'm
 very
 optimistic


about
 China.
 I
 think
 they've
 clearly


have
 some
 some
 huge
 technical
 and


technology
 advantages.
 Now,
 they're


coming
 from
 behind
 in
 some
 of
 the


cutting
 edge
 technologies
 we
 know,
 but


we've
 also
 seen
 how
 quickly
 they
 can


catch
 up
 even
 in
 things
 like
 chip
 design


where
 the
 where
 the
 gap
 was
 enormous


even
 two
 years
 ago.


>> So,
 I
 think
 technically
 uh


technologically,
 China's
 in
 a
 good


place.
 Uh
 China's
 going
 through
 a
 major


transition
 right
 now.
 And
 I
 I've
 at
 SFU


lived
 through
 major
 transitions
 in
 in


economies
 as
 they
 develop
 and
 they're


quite
 ugly.
 They're
 usually
 associated


with
 things
 like
 real
 estate
 crises
 or


or
 bubbles
 bursting
 which
 is
 often


associated
 with
 stock
 market
 crashes,


recessions
 or
 depressions
 in
 some
 case.


Uh
 and
 these
 are
 extremely
 destabilizing


things
 when
 they
 happen
 in
 the
 United


States
 or
 the
 United
 Kingdom
 or
 Norway


or
 anywhere
 else.
 Uh,
 China,
 I
 think,
 is


desperately
 keen
 to
 avoid
 the
 the


adverse
 consequences
 of
 the
 deflation


of,
 in
 their
 case,
 a
 property
 bubble,


which
 was
 also
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an
 equity


market
 bubble,
 but
 really
 it
 was
 a


property
 bubble.
 And
 so
 far
 so
 good
 in


the
 sense
 that
 they've
 not
 had
 a


financial
 crisis
 following
 from
 the
 the


property
 crisis.


>> The
 I
 say
 so
 far
 so
 good
 because
 it's


not
 over.
 The
 property
 market
 hasn't
 yet


begun
 to
 recover.
 The
 financial
 system


is
 intact,
 but
 it's
 it's
 completely


sapped
 consumer
 confidence
 and
 investor


confidence.
 uh
 it's
 tough
 to
 reignite


the
 consumer
 confidence
 in
 China.
 So
 as


we
 sit
 here
 today
 at
 4.8
 or
 so
 percent


growth
 uh
 which
 is
 below
 potential
 for


China.
 It's
 still
 a
 just
 a
 middle-
 inome


country.
 4.8%
 is
 is
 not
 the
 the


appropriate
 long-term
 uh
 growth
 rate
 for


a
 country
 of
 that
 size.
 Uh
 they've
 got


they've
 got
 a
 real
 challenge.
 And
 as
 the


property
 market
 stabilizes,
 the
 equity


market
 has
 begun
 to
 stabilize,
 uh
 I


think
 they
 can
 expect
 I
 think
 then


they'll
 they'll
 inject
 some
 some
 of
 the


stimulus
 that's
 lacking
 today
 in


particular
 into
 the
 consumer
 economy
 and


and
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 lift,
 but
 that


could
 be
 another
 three
 or
 four
 years.
 In


the
 meantime,
 the
 the
 techn
 the


technical
 base
 looks
 quite
 good.
 And
 the


other
 obvious
 challenge
 is
 they've
 got


an
 export-led
 economy
 and
 they're


they're
 so
 strong
 on
 the
 export
 side


that
 that
 they're
 being
 shut
 out
 of
 key


markets
 almost
 entirely
 shut
 out


>> of
 the
 discretionary
 markets
 in
 the
 US


and
 now
 I
 think
 increasingly
 in
 Europe.


>> How
 do
 you
 read
 India?


>> India
 is
 is
 uh
 is
 a
 powerhouse
 uh
 and
 I


think
 the
 reforms
 that
 that
 Prime


Minister
 Modi
 initiated
 10
 years
 ago
 and


has
 is
 carrying
 on
 have
 been
 extremely


effective.
 uh
 it's
 still
 a
 poor
 country


so
 there's
 you
 know
 there's
 there's
 a


ton
 more
 to
 go
 8%
 GDP
 growth
 figure
 in


the
 most
 recent
 quarter
 is
 very


encouraging
 getting
 closer
 to
 what
 we


would
 think
 is
 its
 real
 potential


>> uh
 the
 um
 there's
 still
 much
 more


structural
 real
 form
 to
 do
 there's
 much


more
 infrastructure
 that
 needs
 to
 be


built
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 there's
 ongoing


cultural
 adjustments
 that
 will
 be


necessary
 to
 make
 it
 easier
 for
 foreign


investors
 to
 operate
 in
 the
 country
 but


but
 the
 wheels
 are
 in
 motion
 I
 think


India
 will
 carry
 on
 for
 some
 time


>> middle
 east
 major
 hope
 for
 you


>> middle
 east
 is
 is
 is
 has
 been
 booming


on
 the
 back
 of
 of
 obviously
 oil
 prices


helped
 but
 that's
 less
 of
 a
 of
 a
 tail


>> and
 a
 little
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 English
 people


are
 moving
 there.


>> Well,
 the
 Dubai
 in
 particular
 is
 uh
 is


is
 is
 certainly
 picking
 up
 actually
 the


bulk
 of
 the
 wealth
 that's
 moving
 into


Dubai
 is
 Indian
 or
 South
 Asian.
 uh
 it


started
 during
 co
 because
 it
 turned
 out


it
 was
 a
 really
 nice
 place
 to
 to
 seek


refuge
 and
 uh
 uh
 they
 they've
 been
 very


welcoming
 to
 people
 with
 money
 in
 in
 the


UAE
 but
 that's
 uh
 yeah
 chunks
 of
 the


asset
 management
 industry
 are
 moving
 and


and
 with
 that
 a
 few
 a
 few
 tax
 tax
 exiles


from
 Britain
 I'm
 sorry
 to
 say
 but
 um
 you


know
 I
 think
 the
 region
 is
 I
 mean
 the


most
 interesting
 thing
 about
 the
 Middle


East
 is
 that
 it's
 transforming
 from


being
 an
 an
 oil
 and
 creditor
 economy
 to


being
 a
 developing


>> diversified
 economy.
 it's
 actually


hugely
 capital
 consumptive
 and
 um
 it's


interesting
 to
 see
 at
 the
 at
 the
 the


annual
 uh
 jamberee
 that
 they
 have
 in


Riyad
 uh
 that
 you
 know
 people
 used
 to
 go


thinking
 they
 could
 walk
 away
 with
 money


for
 their
 business
 and
 now
 they
 the


people
 who
 go
 are
 people
 who
 are
 coming


with
 money
 in
 their
 pocket
 to
 invest
 in


the
 exciting
 projects
 there
 and
 it's
 a


big
 change
 in
 just
 5
 years


>> talking
 about
 money
 you've
 been
 an


industry
 leader
 in
 um
 digital
 assets


um
 what
 role
 will
 this
 play
 in
 the


future
 of
 banking


>> I
 I
 think
 it
 will
 be
 absolutely
 central.


I
 our
 view
 is
 uh
 well
 it's
 probably


quite
 controversial
 a
 few
 years
 ago
 less


so
 today
 but
 and
 we
 have
 a
 a
 an


underlying
 view
 which
 is
 that
 eventually


all
 things
 will
 settle
 on
 blockchains


and
 all
 things
 certainly
 means


securities
 uh
 but
 also
 means
 money
 so


payments
 and
 uh
 and
 then
 eventually
 will


mean
 real
 world
 assets
 like
 property
 and


art
 and
 wine
 or
 whatever
 else
 people


might
 want
 to
 invest
 in.
 And
 you
 know


why
 do
 I
 why
 do
 we
 think
 that?
 Because


blockchain
 based
 settlement
 is
 cheaper.


It's
 easier.
 It's
 more
 transparent.
 It's


more
 traceable
 and
 it's
 real
 time.
 So


when
 you've
 got
 all
 those
 advantages,


it's
 hard
 to
 see
 why
 that
 wouldn't


ultimately
 prevail.
 Now
 the
 the
 obstacle


the
 obstacles
 have
 been
 technical.


There's
 the
 there
 are
 no
 longer


technical
 obstacles.
 We've
 piloted


everything.


>> The
 real
 obstacles
 are
 regulation.


Regulators
 are
 understandably
 quite


nervous
 about
 a
 whole
 new
 financial


infrastructure.
 And
 why
 are
 they


particularly
 nervous
 about
 this?


>> So
 I
 think
 they're
 nervous
 for
 different


reasons.
 Uh
 number
 one,
 the
 blockchain


technology,
 the
 only
 place
 it's
 been


deployed
 at
 scale
 is
 cryptocurrencies


and
 cryptocurrencies
 which
 have
 nothing


to
 do
 with
 with
 with
 real
 money
 other


than
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 can
 convert
 them


from
 one
 to
 the
 other.
 Uh
 but


cryptocurrencies
 became
 a
 domain
 for
 the


criminal
 and
 and
 it
 was
 wonderful
 for


moneyaundering
 or
 for
 disposal
 of
 of


illicit
 gains
 or
 whatever.
 And
 uh
 so


that
 already
 makes
 I
 think
 law


enforcement
 and
 and
 regulators
 nervous.


But
 second
 is
 as
 you
 think
 about
 moving


that
 that
 blockchain
 technology
 moving


into
 payments.
 So
 using
 things
 that


aren't
 cryptocurrencies
 but
 are
 digital


assets
 as
 for
 your
 question
 as
 a
 medium


of
 exchange
 for
 payments.
 And
 it's
 quite


a
 natural
 medium
 of
 exchange
 for


payments.
 It
 means
 that
 that
 the
 the


deposits
 are
 no
 longer
 sitting
 in
 banks.


the
 deposits
 are
 sitting
 in
 in
 stable


coins
 which
 today
 the
 big
 stable
 coins


are
 invested
 in
 government
 bonds
 and
 uh


as
 a
 bank
 regulator
 and
 Andrew
 Bailey


head
 of
 the
 bank
 of
 England
 and
 but
 also


chairman
 of
 the
 FSB
 has
 been
 very
 clear


and
 not
 him
 not
 just
 him
 many
 of
 the


bank
 regulators
 have
 been
 very
 clear


that
 a
 system
 that
 that
 drains
 deposits


out
 of
 the
 banking
 system
 basically
 to


fund
 government
 deficits
 is
 an
 unstable


system.
 Uh
 now
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 it
 won't


happen.
 Uh
 and
 or
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 that


that
 that
 bad
 things
 can
 happen
 anyway,


but
 I
 think
 the
 the
 benefits
 of
 of
 a


payment
 system
 that's
 based
 on
 stable


coins,
 which
 would
 include
 also


tokenized
 bank
 deposits,
 i.e.
 you
 keep


the
 money
 in
 the
 banking
 system
 or


central
 bank
 digital
 currencies,
 which


the
 central
 bank
 gets
 the
 money,
 but


they've
 always
 said
 we'll
 keep
 it
 we'll


keep
 it
 quite
 small
 so
 as
 not
 to
 drain


too
 much
 by
 way
 of
 deposits
 from
 the


banking
 system.
 uh
 but
 the
 benefits
 of
 a


stable
 coinbased
 payment
 platform
 are


inexurable
 in
 in
 our
 opinion
 and


therefore
 we've
 been
 investing
 in
 in


that
 area
 for
 seven
 years
 and
 have
 the


leading
 institutional
 grade
 platforms


for
 those
 mechanisms.
 Talking
 about


changes,
 AI,
 how
 will
 that
 change
 your


bank?


>> It's
 a
 I
 think
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 huge


game
 changer.
 Uh
 yeah,
 we
 I
 think
 we've


all
 been
 using
 large


>> is
 it
 already
 or
 is
 it
 just
 it
 is
 in


some
 areas.
 So
 in
 in
 areas
 like
 you
 know


fraud
 detection,
 anti-moneyaundering,


compliance.
 So
 so
 where
 where
 we've


always
 been
 trolling
 big
 data


>> for
 for
 patterns
 or
 or
 incidents.
 Um
 it


has
 already
 you
 know
 dra
 drastically


improved
 our
 ability
 to
 fight
 financial


crime.
 You
 know
 PS
 we
 still
 only
 capture


3%
 of
 the
 financial
 crime
 that
 we
 think


is
 committed
 in
 the
 world.
 So
 it's
 like


we've
 hardly
 broken
 the
 back
 of
 the


criminal,
 but
 but
 it's
 but
 it's
 a
 huge


improvement.
 U
 I
 think
 uh
 I
 think
 pretty


much
 anybody
 that
 builds
 large
 scale


systems
 is
 using
 AI
 for
 code
 generation.


So
 programming
 uh
 that's
 already
 that's


but
 that's
 productivity.
 I
 think
 the


productivity
 investments
 will
 be


meaningful
 and
 will
 allow
 companies
 to


grow
 with
 improved
 profitability.
 the
 uh


the
 big
 changes
 will
 come
 with
 uh
 with


product
 development
 uh
 with
 customer


service
 when
 when
 we
 were
 deploying


agents
 in
 scale
 to
 improve
 the
 the


customer
 outcomes
 and
 advice


>> and
 that
 I
 think
 we're
 very
 early
 stage


in
 those
 applications.


>> Uh
 let's
 move
 on
 to
 corporate
 culture.


Um
 you
 talked
 about
 a
 bit
 about
 your


your
 leadership
 style
 but
 how
 do
 you
 how


would
 you
 describe
 the
 corporate
 culture


in
 the
 bank?
 I
 think
 our
 culture
 is


highly
 collaborative
 and
 uh
 I
 say
 that


would
 be
 the
 big
 positive
 and
 based
 on


on
 diverse
 inputs.
 So
 we're
 structurally


diverse
 as
 as
 a
 company
 and
 by
 that
 I


mean
 you
 operate
 in
 in
 55
 markets


physically
 another
 120
 via
 via
 uh
 you


know
 fly
 in
 fly
 out
 and
 contact
 and
 we


have
 people
 from
 all
 those
 countries.


>> What
 what
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the
 parts
 of


the
 culture
 which
 you
 are
 trying
 to


change?
 So
 the
 negatives
 of
 the


collaborative
 culture
 are
 the
 slowness


of
 decision-m
 and
 getting
 things
 done.


So
 some
 of
 that
 will
 come
 from
 the
 risk


aversion
 that
 I
 that
 I
 mentioned
 earlier


and
 you
 there's
 some
 legacy
 hangovers


from
 that.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 the
 the


bigger
 issue
 is
 in
 a
 very
 diverse


organization
 where
 people
 don't
 always


connect.
 You
 can't
 you
 don't
 have
 the


eye
 contact
 that
 means
 that
 I
 know


exactly
 what
 you're
 saying
 and
 what


you're
 saying
 that
 you're
 not
 saying
 uh


or
 something
 like
 that.
 Uh
 we
 have
 it's


a
 little
 bit
 too
 hard
 to
 get
 things
 done


in
 our
 bank.
 So
 some
 of
 that
 is


simplifying
 process,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 that


is
 culture.


>> And
 how
 do
 you
 go
 about
 changing
 that?


>> We
 uh
 so
 so
 we're
 we're
 tackling
 the
 the


relative
 complexity
 of
 our
 bank
 by


streamlining
 our
 processes
 mechanically.


And
 then
 that's
 that's
 that's
 the


hardware.
 The
 software
 is
 better


feedback
 systems
 so
 that
 that
 we
 can
 the


people
 who
 are
 who
 go
 beyond


collaboration
 into
 actual
 execution
 and


getting
 things
 done
 and
 and
 helping


their
 partners
 are
 recognized
 as
 such.


And
 that
 flows
 through
 to
 prospects
 for


promotion
 or
 pay
 or
 or
 whatever
 else
 is


is
 good
 in
 one's
 life.
 Uh
 but
 we've
 got


to
 have
 an
 equal
 focus
 on
 hardware
 and


software
 to
 to
 really
 shift
 the
 culture


of
 the
 place.


>> How
 do
 you
 benchmark
 speed?


>> It's
 a
 really
 good
 question.
 How
 do
 we


benchmark
 speed?
 Uh


>> because
 we
 also
 work
 on
 getting
 speed


up.
 Speed
 is
 a
 an
 obsession
 of
 mine.
 You


know,
 I


I
 think
 organizations
 which
 make
 fast


investment
 fast
 decisions
 generally
 make


better
 decisions.


>> Yep.
 So
 we
 uh


one
 of the
 measures
 that
 we
 look
 at


carefully
 is
 what
 our
 colleagues
 tell
 us


about
 their
 sense
 of
 speed.
 Uh
 we


measure
 in
 in
 terms
 of
 processes,
 we


measure
 turnaround
 times.
 Just
 how
 many


minutes
 or
 hours
 or
 days
 does
 it
 take
 to


get
 from
 from
 where
 we
 start
 to
 to
 point


B.


>> Uh
 so
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 onboarding
 a
 new


asset
 manager,
 we
 want
 to
 know
 that
 we


can
 get
 that
 time
 down
 from
 60
 days
 to


six
 and
 and
 then
 down
 to
 to
 six
 hours


and
 eventually
 to
 six
 minutes.
 probably


never
 happened
 but
 given
 the
 the


screening
 that
 needs
 to
 be
 done


>> but
 uh
 but
 benchmarking
 speed
 generally


in
 in
 one
 sort
 of
 universal
 metric
 uh


you've
 given
 me
 a
 good
 challenge.


>> You
 mentioned
 the
 the
 risk
 aversion
 just


how
 do
 you
 handle
 mistakes
 in
 that


environment.


>> I
 think
 I'm
 quite
 tolerant
 of
 errors
 of


judgment
 and
 I'm
 completely
 intolerant


of
 errors
 of
 principle.
 So
 when
 we
 find


an
 error
 or
 principle,
 it's
 an
 instant


out.
 And
 when
 there's
 an
 error
 of


judgment,
 there's
 there's
 a
 unless
 it's


material
 or
 very
 frequently
 repeated,
 uh


it's
 it's
 indulged.
 I
 I
 insist
 on


understanding
 what
 the
 root
 cause
 of
 the


of
 the
 problem
 was


>> and
 understanding
 how
 what
 wherever
 the


mistake
 came
 from,
 how
 you're
 going to


deal
 with
 it
 to
 make
 sure
 it
 doesn't


come
 again
 or
 to
 take
 best
 steps
 for
 it


not
 to
 come
 again.


>> Uh
 but
 yeah,
 that's
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 we


embrace
 failure.
 That's
 that's
 a
 that's


a
 that's
 cliche.
 Uh
 but
 we
 have
 plenty


of
 it.
 So
 for
 example,
 we
 have
 a
 we
 set


up
 a
 venture
 lab.
 Uh
 the
 venture
 lab
 has


been
 extremely
 successful.
 We've


created,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 best
 digital


banks
 in
 Hong
 Kong
 and
 Singapore.
 We've,


you
 know,
 monetized
 ventures
 in
 in
 India


and
 and
 in
 the
 UK.
 Uh
 we've
 got
 a
 good


return
 on
 invested
 capital
 in
 our


venture
 lab.
 Now,
 at
 the
 top
 of
 the


funnel
 is
 2,000
 investments
 or
 2,300


investments
 that
 we've
 looked
 at.
 At
 the


bottom
 end
 of
 the
 funnel,
 we've
 got
 40


that
 we've
 materially
 commercialized


>> and
 uh
 we've
 got
 five
 that
 we've


completely
 commercialized.
 So
 that's


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 failure
 in
 that
 1,960


um
 not
 all
 failures.
 Some
 of
 them
 we


just
 decided
 to
 discontinue


>> but
 the
 uh
 so
 perfectly
 happy
 to
 to
 try


and
 and
 then
 not
 succeed


>> sometimes
 is
 failure.


>> Uh
 and
 that
 actually
 has
 helped
 to


change
 the
 I
 think
 the
 tone
 within
 the


company
 that
 that
 you
 know
 better
 to
 try


uh
 and
 fail
 than
 to
 not
 have
 tried
 at


all.


>> Yeah.
 So
 Bill
 you
 are
 everybody
 in
 the


bank
 would
 look
 at
 you
 right
 you
 are
 the


role
 model.
 How
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 use


that
 role
 model
 to
 uh
 breathe
 and
 live


the
 corporate
 culture
 that
 you
 want


other
 people
 to
 replicate?


>> You
 know,
 this
 role
 model
 question
 is


interesting
 because
 I
 I
 one
 I'm
 not
 keen


to
 be
 a
 role
 model
 a
 the
 role
 I'm
 not


keen
 to
 be
 the
 role
 model
 especially
 in


a
 bank
 that's
 as
 diverse
 as
 ours
 because


like
 what
 am
 I?
 I'm
 I'm
 an
 American
 guy


who's
 lived
 in
 the
 UK
 for
 32
 years
 and


and
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 around
 the


world.
 uh
 but
 when
 I
 what
 I
 would
 like


the
 role
 model
 to
 be
 is
 the
 aggregation


of
 the
 senior
 managers
 who's
 the
 the


person
 from
 Hong
 Kong
 who's
 been
 in
 the


bank
 for
 25
 years,
 the
 person
 from


Europe
 who's
 been
 in
 the
 bank
 for
 two


years,
 uh
 the
 person
 from
 India,
 the


person
 from
 Africa,
 etc.
 And


collectively
 we're
 a
 role
 model
 and
 and


and
 we're
 really
 collectively
 a
 role


model
 if
 we
 work
 together
 as
 a
 seamless


team
 despite
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 come
 from


very
 different
 backgrounds
 both


culturally,
 linguistically
 uh
 and
 uh
 and


and
 organizationally.
 So,
 but
 yeah,
 but


what
 what
 I
 would
 like
 people
 to
 see
 for


me
 is
 that
 it's
 okay
 to
 take
 risk.
 Uh


it's
 okay
 to
 to
 I
 mean,
 you've
 got
 to
 be


curious.
 I'm
 I'm
 super
 curious
 and
 I


want
 the
 people
 that
 work
 with
 me
 to
 be


extremely
 curious
 themselves
 and
 I
 want


them
 to
 be
 extremely
 empathetic.
 Those


to
 me
 are
 the
 two
 defining
 terms
 uh
 for


leadership
 are
 are
 curiosity
 and


empathy.


>> What
 do
 you
 say
 that
 drive
 drives
 you


now?


>> Curiosity
 and
 empathy.
 I
 I'm
 I'm


extremely
 curious.
 I
 I
 love
 learning.
 I


I
 mean
 and
 that's
 also
 very
 cliche
 but


it
 just
 happens
 to
 be
 true.
 And


>> what
 are
 the
 kind
 of
 things
 you
 try
 to


learn
 now?


>> Uh
 so
 I
 learn
 in
 lots
 of
 different


realms.
 Uh
 I
 of
 course
 the
 environment


that
 we're
 operating
 in
 is
 changing


every
 day
 and
 I'm
 learning
 a
 lot
 about


geopolitics
 at
 the
 moment.
 I'm
 learning


a
 lot
 about
 innovation
 and
 I've
 always


been
 curious
 whether
 innovation
 can
 be


taught
 or
 it's
 a
 character
 trait.


>> What
 do
 you
 think?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 Uh
 I
 think
 some
 people
 are


innately
 curious
 and
 I
 think
 other


people
 can
 adopt
 uh
 sorry
 innately


innovative
 and
 I
 think
 other
 people
 uh


can
 adopt
 innovative
 characteristics


through
 training.


>> Why
 are
 some
 people
 more
 curious
 than


others?
 uh
 more
 curious.
 Uh


I
 probably
 starts
 in
 the
 womb
 more
 or


less,
 but
 I
 I
 know
 I
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 an


extremely
 curious
 household
 and
 uh
 we


didn't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 to
 travel


around,
 but
 we
 but
 when
 we
 scraped
 a


little
 bit
 together,
 we
 tried
 to
 see
 the


world
 because
 it
 was
 something
 new
 and


something
 different.
 And
 now
 I'm
 getting


paid
 to
 do
 the
 same
 thing.
 It's


fantastic.


>> Do
 you
 think
 ambition
 and
 curiosity
 go


together?


>> I
 do.
 I
 do.
 Ambition
 is
 a
 bit
 of a


curse.


>> Tell
 me.
 Well,
 I
 think
 ambition
 uh
 lead


leads
 to
 perpetual
 dissatisfaction


unless
 you're
 unless
 you
 lose
 the


ambition
 at
 some
 point.
 And
 so
 I
 think


it's
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 curse.
 So
 sometimes
 I


wish
 I
 wasn't
 ambitious.
 Sometimes
 I


wish


>> are
 you
 like
 perpetually
 dissatisfied?


>> Well,
 I
 always
 I
 want
 always
 want
 to


keep
 on
 going.
 Yeah.


>> How
 long
 do
 you
 think
 you
 you
 would
 keep


going
 for?


>> As
 long
 as
 you
 let
 me.


>> Uh
 when
 do
 you
 wake
 up
 in
 the
 morning?


>> I
 usually
 wake
 up
 about
 5:30.
 Um


>> and
 what
 do
 you
 do
 then?
 I
 I
 read
 I
 read


in
 bed
 for
 a
 bit
 and
 uh
 so
 I
 so
 I
 kind


of
 clear
 all
 my
 emails
 and
 the
 research


and
 and
 news
 that
 comes
 in
 overnight.


>> Still
 in
 bed.


>> Still
 in
 bed.
 Yeah.
 And
 uh
 maybe


>> you
 got
 one
 of these
 kind
 of
 tables
 that


sits
 over
 your
 bed.
 So
 you


>> I
 I
 have
 this
 this
 iPhone
 thing
 that


that's
 pretty
 good
 for
 for
 that.
 Uh
 my


wife
 also
 gets
 up
 about
 the
 same
 time.


If
 I'm
 lucky,
 we
 get
 up
 together,
 have
 a


cup
 of
 coffee
 before
 I
 head
 off
 to
 work.


And
 uh
 and
 then
 uh
 of
 course
 I
 travel
 a


lot.
 So
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 I'm
 alone
 in
 that


bed
 in
 which
 case
 I
 can
 I
 can
 hang
 out
 a


little
 bit
 longer.


>> What
 do
 you
 read?


>> Uh
 so
 well
 for
 for
 for
 work
 it's


whatever
 comes
 in
 overnight
 which
 is
 a


lot
 of
 research
 and
 and
 at
 news
 and
 and


emails
 in
 my
 free
 time
 and
 I
 do
 try
 to


get
 a
 little bit
 of
 free
 time
 every
 day.


I
 typically
 read
 fiction
 and
 uh
 I
 uh


typically
 fiction
 that's
 that's
 kind
 of


hard
 to
 get
 through.
 I
 want
 to
 be


challenged.
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 but
 I
 do


>> give
 me
 an
 example
 of
 a
 hard
 fiction


book.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 uh,


what
 am
 I?
 So,
 I
 mean,
 right
 now
 it's


actually
 not
 fiction.
 Well,
 it's
 So,
 I'm


reading
 George
 Saunders.
 He's
 a


fabulous,
 uh,
 American
 short
 story


author,
 but
 he's
 also
 written
 some


novels,
 is
 one
 pullet
 surprises,
 things


like
 that.
 And
 I
 actually,
 uh,
 attended


a
 lecture
 of
 his
 in
 upstate
 New
 York


about
 15
 years
 ago.
 He's
 fabulous.
 So,


he's
 he's
 written
 a
 a
 a
 book
 on
 the


Russian
 short
 story,
 which
 he
 considers


to
 be
 the
 perfect
 form.
 Uh,
 so
 it's
 six


Russian
 short
 short
 stories,
 a
 Czechov,


Jurgenov,
 and
 others.
 Uh
 and
 then
 he


analyzes
 them
 and
 it's
 actually
 a
 an


it's
 a
 university
 lecture
 and
 analyzes


it
 page
 by
 page.
 So
 it's
 kind
 of
 fiction


because
 the
 story
 is
 fiction.
 U
 but
 the


rest
 is
 a
 lecture.
 Why
 do
 I
 read
 that?


Because
 it's
 just
 really
 interesting.


>> Now
 you
 and
 your
 wife
 are
 very
 into
 uh


theater
 and
 your
 wife
 runs
 the
 Cornet


Theater
 in
 Notting
 Hill
 where
 they
 by


the
 way
 sometimes
 put
 on
 Norwegian
 plays


in
 Norwegian.
 Can
 you
 imagine


>> and
 they
 are
 sellouts?


>> They
 are.
 They
 are.


>> Why
 why
 is
 theater
 so
 important
 for
 you


guys?


>> Well,
 this
 is
 my
 wife's
 theater.
 I'm


moral
 support
 and
 and
 I
 and
 but
 I
 love


it
 because
 it's
 obviously
 it's
 it's
 an


alternative
 it's
 it's
 an
 alternative


life
 for
 me
 actually
 when
 I
 go
 into
 the


cornet
 theater
 in
 Notting
 Hill
 in
 London


uh
 I'm's
 husband
 and
 period
 full
 stop


and
 if
 I'm
 wearing
 a
 business
 suit
 they


say
 like
 why
 are
 you
 the
 only
 guy
 here


in
 a
 in
 a
 gray
 suit
 and
 so
 don't
 worry


about
 that
 there's
 my
 wife
 uh
 but
 uh
 no


it's
 um
 I
 think
 it's
 extremely
 important


for
 all
 of
 us
 to
 to
 give
 back
 to
 our


communities
 in
 our
 own
 ways
 and
 that
 can


come
 in
 lots
 of
 different
 forms
 forms.


Uh
 this
 is
 a
 theater
 that
 focuses
 on


international
 work.
 It
 features


prominently
 Norwegian
 work.
 Uh
 I
 think


we
 had
 I
 think
 we
 were
 the
 first
 theater


to
 put
 on
 Yan
 Fussy,
 the
 famous


Norwegian
 playwright
 after
 he
 won
 the


Nobel
 Prize.
 That's
 right.
 And
 uh
 which


if
 I'm
 not
 mistaken
 you
 may
 have
 helped


with
 and
 uh
 that's
 a
 uh
 it's
 very


special
 uh
 to
 to
 have
 that
 kind
 of
 a


position
 in
 uh
 in
 in
 a
 local
 community.


>> What's
 the
 play
 that
 everybody
 should


see?


>> Oh,
 there's
 so
 many
 plays
 that
 everybody


should
 see.
 the
 um
 well
 everybody
 should


see
 Hamlet
 just
 I
 think
 most
 people
 have


seen
 Hamlet
 but
 if
 you
 haven't
 it's


because
 it's
 it
 is
 just
 the
 the
 classic


story
 of
 the
 tragedy
 of
 life
 and
 death


and
 power
 and
 and
 and


empathy
 and
 curiosity
 and
 and
 insecurity


etc
 etc
 but
 but
 uh
 but
 not
 very
 modern


uh
 although
 but
 maybe
 say
 timeless
 uh


maybe
 the
 Ipsson
 is
 frequently
 referred


to
 as
 the
 as
 the


European
 Shakespeare
 or
 the


>> well
 I
 think
 is
 the
 number
 who
 played
 uh


playwright
 after
 after
 Shakespeare.


>> Yep.
 And
 for
 good
 reason.
 And
 and


whether
 it's
 the
 uh
 you
 know,
 Doll's


House
 would
 be
 would
 be
 a
 pretty
 good


one
 or
 uh
 probably
 probably
 I'd
 probably


stop
 there.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 Bill,
 in
 in
 addition
 to
 seeing


this
 uh
 place,
 what
 is
 your
 advice
 to


young
 people?


>> My
 advice
 to
 young
 young
 people
 is
 uh


stay
 on
 the
 path
 but
 not
 for
 very
 long


and
 find
 a
 way.
 There
 was
 a
 famous


American
 called
 Yogi
 Barra
 who
 said,


"When
 you
 get
 to
 a
 fork
 in
 the
 road,


take
 it."
 Which
 you
 have
 to
 think
 about


a
 little
 bit
 to
 realize
 how
 ridiculous


that
 is.
 But
 but but
 the
 gist
 of
 it
 is,


you
 know,
 when
 you
 when
 you
 do
 come
 to
 a


a
 a
 turning
 point
 from
 time
 to
 time,
 go


the
 reckless
 route.
 And
 if
 you
 go
 the


reckless
 route
 early,
 uh
 you
 can
 recover


very
 easily.


>> Don't
 go
 the
 reckless
 route
 right
 at
 the


end
 of
 your
 working
 life.
 But
 in
 the


beginning,
 and
 then
 you
 ask
 about
 young


people,
 take
 a
 risk.
 And
 I
 can
 I
 can
 say


I
 only
 made
 two
 or
 three
 decisions
 my


whole
 working
 life.
 You
 know,
 one
 of


them
 was
 to
 come
 to
 Standard
 Chartered.


Uh
 one
 of
 them
 was
 to
 go
 into
 that


derivative
 business
 that
 I
 talked
 about


earlier,
 which
 was
 40
 years
 earlier,
 30


years
 earlier.
 And
 those
 are
 two
 of
 the


best
 decisions
 I
 took
 because
 they
 were


very
 they
 were
 reckless
 actually.
 It
 was


reckless
 for
 me
 to
 give
 up
 my
 cozy
 life


and
 asset
 management
 and
 and
 go
 work
 for


this
 struggling
 emerging
 markets
 trade


bank.
 But
 it's
 worked
 out
 really
 well


for
 me.
 uh
 and
 I
 did
 it
 because
 I


thought
 it
 would
 be
 a
 great
 challenge


and
 I
 quite
 enjoy
 risk
 and
 the
 same


thing
 back
 in
 my
 earlier
 days.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 would
 say
 they
 have
 worked


out
 very
 well
 indeed.
 Uh
 and
 it's
 been


really
 really
 great
 talking
 to
 you.
 Big


thanks.
 All
 the
 best.


>> Thank
 you.
