[music]


If
 you
 buy
 this
 thing
 and
 it
 sits
 in


your
 vanity
 and
 you
 never
 use
 it,
 the


value
 is
 zero.
 So
 if
 the
 one
 that
 you


keep
 using
 is
 the
 one
 that
 cost
 a
 little


bit
 more,
 so
 be
 it.
 That's
 the
 one
 you


should
 use.


>> I'm
 Kyra
 Blackwell.


>> I'm
 Rosie
 Garin.
 And
 you're
 listening
 to


the
 Wire
 Cutter
 Show.


>> [music]


>> Hi,
 Kyra.


>> Hi,
 Rosie.


>> Hi,
 my
 friend.
 Uh,
 it's
 winter
 time,


isn't
 it?


>> It's
 so
 cold.


>> It's
 cold
 in
 New
 York.
 It's
 cold.


>> It's
 windy.
 It's
 blistering.


>> We're
 talking
 moisturizers
 today,
 and


that's
 not
 incidental.
 It's
 dry.


>> Yeah.
 My
 skin
 is
 crying
 right
 now.


>> Mine,
 too.
 So,
 I
 was
 excited
 to
 see
 Wire


Creder's
 Guide
 published
 about
 facial


moisturizers
 and
 body
 lotions,


specifically
 things
 you
 can
 find
 in
 the


drugstore.
 I
 want
 to
 know
 more
 cuz
 I
 I


realize
 I
 know
 very
 very
 little.
 Yeah,


I'm
 really
 excited
 to
 learn
 more,
 too.


And
 I'm
 excited
 for
 the
 person
 [music]


who's
 going
 to
 take
 us
 on
 this
 journey.


It's
 Jen
 Sullivan.
 She
 is
 amazing.
 She's


a
 senior
 editor
 here
 at
 Wire
 Cutter
 on


[music]
 the
 beauty
 team.
 And
 she's
 been


covering
 beauty
 for
 at
 least
 25
 years.


So,
 she's
 going
 to
 really
 walk
 us


through
 [music]
 the
 basics
 of


moisturizer,
 what
 you
 know,
 what
 you


think
 you
 might
 know,
 and
 how
 to
 apply


them,
 and
 keep
 your
 skin
 smooth,
 soft,


and
 hydrated
 all
 winter
 [music]
 long.


So,
 60,000
 questions
 for
 Jen
 after
 the


break.
 We'll
 be
 right
 back.


>> [music]


>> Welcome
 back.
 With
 us
 now
 is
 Jen


Sullivan,
 a
 senior
 editor
 on
 Wire


Cutters
 beauty
 team
 who's
 been
 covering


beauty
 for
 at
 least
 25
 years.
 She
 also


hosted
 her
 own
 awardwinning
 podcast,
 Fat


Mascara.
 So,
 Jen
 really
 is
 a
 pro.
 Hi,


Jen.


>> Hi.


>> Hi.
 Today,
 we're
 talking
 moisturizer,


and
 we're
 going to
 zoom
 way
 out
 to


start.
 So,
 can
 you
 just
 first
 explain


what
 we
 mean
 when
 we
 say
 moisturizer?


What
 are
 we
 talking
 about?
 Uh,
 we
 can


meet
 a
 lot
 of
 things,
 but
 I
 think
 we


talk
 about
 topical
 products
 you
 put
 on


your
 skin
 to
 add
 back
 in
 hydration,
 lock


in
 hydration,
 prevent
 water
 loss,
 soften


your
 skin.
 They
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 things.
 And


who
 is
 it
 good
 for?
 Who
 needs
 to
 be


using
 moisturizer?
 I
 would
 argue
 all
 of


us
 at
 some
 point
 in
 our
 lives
 because,


you
 know,
 when
 you're
 young,
 your
 skin


barrier
 is
 not
 super
 strong.
 You
 might


not
 be
 good
 at
 holding
 in
 moisture.
 As


you
 get
 older,
 your
 skin
 gets
 drier.
 And


explain
 what
 you
 mean
 by
 skin
 barrier.


meaning
 your
 cell's
 ability
 to
 hold
 in


the
 water
 that
 is
 in
 your
 skin
 is
 not
 as


strong
 as
 someone
 who's
 a
 little
 bit


older
 cuz
 I
 was
 talking
 about
 kids
 in


that
 for
 particular
 example.


>> Gotcha.


>> So,
 Jen,
 say
 somebody
 does
 the
 wire


cutter
 method
 at
 home
 and
 maybe
 they
 buy


like
 three
 different
 brands
 to
 try
 at


once.
 What
 should
 their
 testing
 process


actually
 look
 like?


>> Oh,
 I'm
 I'm
 so
 glad
 they're
 trying
 to


mimic
 what
 we
 do
 in
 the
 [laughter]


office
 because
 we
 put
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 into


it.
 If
 you
 want
 to
 buy
 three
 and
 you


want
 to
 try,
 I
 mean,
 I
 would
 say
 buy


one,
 see
 if
 it
 works,
 then
 buy
 the
 other


two.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 if
 you
 have
 sensitive
 skin,
 I
 would


say
 patch
 test
 first.
 Just
 use
 a
 little


bit
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 it
 doesn't


irritate
 you.
 Right
 on
 contact


>> on
 any
 part
 of
 your
 body.


>> Dermatologists
 say,
 and
 by
 the
 way,


guys,
 I
 am
 not
 a
 dermatologist.
 So


everything
 I'm
 saying,
 take
 with
 a
 grain


of,
 you
 know,
 salt.
 Try
 your
 body
 first


and
 make
 sure
 that
 like
 you
 like
 the


scent,
 it
 doesn't
 bother
 you,
 all
 that


kind
 of
 stuff.


>> Got
 it?
 And
 then
 I
 don't
 know if
 people


are
 going
 to
 like
 this,
 but
 at least
 30


days
 to
 see
 how
 it
 works
 for
 your
 skin.


>> 30
 days.


>> It
 takes
 that
 long
 for
 your
 skin
 to
 like


turn
 over
 and
 get
 a
 new
 set
 of
 skin


cells
 going.
 So
 you
 really
 want
 to
 like


see
 how
 it
 worked
 through
 that
 whole


process.


>> And
 you
 really
 do
 have
 to
 pinpoint.
 So


if
 you're
 going to
 add
 something
 new
 to


your
 routine,
 don't
 change
 anything


else.
 So
 if
 you
 do
 see
 something
 wrong,


you
 can
 know
 exactly
 what
 the
 problem


is.
 Right.


>> Spoken
 like
 a
 wire
 cutter
 editor.
 Yes.


Single
 variable.
 [laughter]


>> Yes.
 So,
 can
 you
 tell
 us
 what
 people


should
 look
 for
 to
 know
 if
 the


moisturizer
 is
 working
 or
 if
 it
 isn't


working?


>> I
 feel
 like
 a
 good
 moisturizer,
 you're


going
 to
 forget
 about
 like
 you're
 going


to
 find
 yourself
 using
 it
 cuz
 your
 skin


feels
 comfortable
 and
 good.
 It
 doesn't


feel
 like
 anything.
 It
 doesn't
 make
 you


feel
 worse
 and
 your
 skin
 is
 acting
 the


way
 it
 should.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 if
 it's
 not,
 you're
 itchy.
 You're


maybe
 a
 little
 red.
 You're
 maybe
 just
 a


little
 Yeah.
 Well,
 then
 definitely


change
 things
 up.
 Change
 it.
 Change
 it


up.
 Okay.
 So
 this
 guide,
 this


specifically
 this
 facial
 moisturizer


guide,
 we
 have
 seven
 picks
 and
 eight
 in


the
 body
 lotion
 guide.
 Can
 you
 first


explain
 the
 difference
 between
 facial


moisturizer
 and
 body
 lotion
 because
 I


think
 many
 people
 use
 them


interchangeably.
 Some
 people
 use
 them


interchangeably
 or
 at least
 want
 to
 or


at least
 want
 to.


>> The
 difference
 between
 face
 moisturizer


and
 body
 moisturizer
 is
 marketing.


>> No
 way.


>> Yes.
 I
 mean,
 there
 are
 products
 there


are
 body
 products
 you
 can
 use
 around


your
 face,
 face
 products
 you
 can
 use
 on


your
 body.
 It
 depends
 on
 you
 and
 your


particular
 skin
 needs,
 but
 by
 and
 large,


it's
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 same
 ingredients
 in


both
 those
 types
 of
 products.
 I
 will
 say


that
 the
 body
 skin
 tends
 to
 be
 drier.


So,
 those
 products
 tend
 to
 be
 like


richer
 formulas,
 a
 little
 bit
 thicker,


maybe
 more
 olusives,
 which
 are
 those
 uh


skin
 care
 protecting.
 They
 protect
 the


barrier
 of
 the
 skin


>> like
 a
 Vaseline.
 Petroleum
 jelly
 is
 an


olusive,
 yes,
 but
 there
 are
 lots
 of


others.
 But
 like
 some
 people
 don't
 like


the
 feel
 of
 a
 thicker
 product
 on
 their


face.
 It
 feels
 greasy
 and
 your
 face
 has


more
 oil
 glands,
 so
 it's
 kind
 of
 got
 its


own
 moisture
 going
 on
 that
 you
 might
 not


always
 find
 on
 your
 body.
 But
 by
 and


large,
 if
 like
 a
 product
 works
 for
 you


all
 over,
 you
 only
 need
 one
 product.


Live
 your
 life.


>> [music]


>> So,
 is
 there
 a
 cheat
 sheet
 for
 people
 to


know
 or
 remember
 where
 like
 they
 know


that
 they
 have
 a
 skin
 type,
 what
 kind
 of


moisturizer
 will
 match
 with
 that
 skin


type?
 How
 do
 you
 make
 that
 decision
 a


little
 bit
 easier?


>> It's
 all
 preference.
 It
 really
 is.


That's
 why
 we
 have
 so
 many
 choices


because
 we
 want
 to
 give
 you
 options.


There's
 no
 set
 math
 equation
 of
 like


drier
 skin
 needs
 more
 of
 X
 ingredient.


It's
 different
 for
 everybody.
 We're


we're
 unique
 people.
 We
 have
 a
 whole


microbiome
 that's
 completely
 different


than
 the
 person
 next
 to
 us.
 We
 like


different
 things,
 how
 they
 feel,
 how


they
 smell,
 all
 of
 that.
 So,
 that's
 why


we
 have
 so
 many
 choices.
 I
 will
 say
 if


you
 tend
 to
 be
 on
 the
 drier
 side,
 our


testers
 found
 this.
 A
 dermatologist


would
 say
 that
 thicker,
 more
 olusive,


more
 hydrating,
 richer
 might
 be
 the
 word


that
 I'm
 trying
 to
 use.
 Those
 are
 the


products
 you
 might
 want
 to
 look
 for.
 If


you
 have
 oily
 skin
 and
 you
 put
 that
 on,


a
 lot
 of
 people
 come
 away
 being
 like,


"That
 made
 me
 greasy."
 Yeah.


>> So,
 you
 don't
 want
 that.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 And


when
 it
 comes
 to
 moisturizing,
 what
 do


you
 think
 is
 the
 most
 misunderstood
 skin


type?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 would
 talk
 to
 a
 dermatologist


to
 really
 get
 into
 this,
 but
 for
 me,


it's
 probably
 sensitivity
 in
 general.


The
 idea
 of
 sensitive
 skin.
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 people
 think
 they're
 inherently


just
 so
 sensitive,
 but
 what's
 really


going
 on
 is
 something
 in
 their


environment
 or
 some
 product
 that
 they're


using.
 Not
 even
 a
 skincare
 product.


Could
 be
 like
 the
 laundry
 detergent
 or


the
 air
 was
 drier.
 So,


>> cleaning
 products.


>> Yeah.
 and
 then
 and
 then
 we
 try
 and
 fix


the
 problem.
 We
 use
 more
 stuff
 to
 fix


the
 problem
 and
 pairing
 back
 and
 making


things
 simpler
 might
 be
 the
 fix.
 So,
 I


think
 that's
 kind
 of
 a
 misunderstood


concept.
 And
 the
 thing
 to
 be
 careful
 of


with
 this
 moisturizer
 that
 we
 didn't


touch
 on
 yet
 is
 the
 idea
 of
 active


ingredients.
 These
 are
 the
 treatment


ingredients.
 Like
 they
 might
 be
 in
 your


face
 lotion,
 but
 they're
 for
 treating


things.
 These
 are
 like
 retinols,


peptides,
 sometimes
 alpha
 hydroxy
 acids.


If
 you're
 just
 looking
 for
 moisture,


don't
 pick
 something
 with
 activives.


Just
 look
 for
 the
 hydrating
 ingredients


because
 those
 activives
 can
 set
 up
 where


you're
 building
 sensitivity.


[music]


>> What
 are
 people
 doing
 wrong
 when
 they're


applying
 moisturizer?


>> I
 would
 say


>> let's
 call
 some
 people
 out.
 [laughter]


>> Ideally
 by
 name
 if
 you
 have
 any
 uh


examples.


>> Oh,
 we
 could
 get
 into
 that.
 But
 I


[laughter]
 think
 that
 the
 thing
 they're


doing
 wrong
 is
 waiting
 till
 they're
 dry


to
 apply
 the
 moisturizer.
 Like
 most


people,
 you
 want
 to
 do
 it
 before
 you
 got


in
 a
 cycle
 of
 my
 skin
 is
 dry
 and
 flaky


and
 itchy.
 So,
 you
 want
 to
 apply
 it
 when


your
 skin
 is
 just
 acting
 normal
 and
 you


want
 to
 upkeep
 the
 hydration
 and
 also
 do


it
 when
 skin
 is
 damp.
 And
 I
 went
 through


years
 of
 being
 a
 beauty
 editor
 being


like,
 "Oh,
 every
 time
 I
 try
 to
 apply


moisturizer
 to
 damp
 skin,
 it
 gets
 all


slimy
 or
 filmy."
 You've
 all
 heard
 this


tip,
 right?
 Like,
 make
 sure
 your
 skin's


damp
 when
 you
 apply
 your
 moisturizer.


Lock
 in
 that
 water
 that's
 already
 there.


>> So,
 I
 like
 talked
 to
 all
 these


dermatologists
 and
 finally
 come
 to


realize
 the
 word
 damp
 is
 like
 different


for
 many
 people.
 I
 was
 picturing
 like


got
 out
 of
 the
 shower,
 didn't
 towel
 off


yet.
 I
 am
 damp.
 You're
 wet.
 No.
 No.


They're
 like,
 "You
 can
 towel
 off.
 It's


just
 within
 like
 the
 3
 minutes
 of


toweling
 off,
 there's
 still
 moisture
 in


your
 skin
 that
 hasn't
 started


evaporating
 out
 of
 your
 skin
 yet."
 They


consider
 that
 to
 be
 damp
 skin.
 So,
 if


you
 start
 trying
 to
 put
 moisturizer
 on


wet
 skin
 or
 just
 out
 of
 the
 shower,
 not


towel
 dried,
 haven't
 you
 noticed
 it
 gets


all
 really?
 It
 does
 get
 slimy.
 You're


thinking
 in
 your
 head,
 "Oh,
 the
 derms


told
 me
 I
 got
 to
 do
 it
 while
 it's
 wet."


You're
 mixing
 your
 moisturizer
 with
 the


water
 on
 your
 skin.
 You're
 watering
 it


down.
 [laughter]


>> So,
 by
 damp,
 what
 they
 mean
 is
 the
 skin


has
 an
 inherent
 dampness
 still
 in
 its


like
 epidermis,
 but
 it
 might
 be
 dry
 to


the
 touch.
 Does
 that
 make
 sense?


>> It
 does.
 And
 I
 learned
 something
 new


today.


>> Yeah.
 We're
 talking
 about
 moisture
 here,


but
 the
 idea
 is
 hydration.
 So,
 there's


things
 other
 than
 moisturizer
 that
 you


can
 do
 to
 make
 sure
 you're
 more


hydrated.
 And
 one
 of
 them
 is
 the
 shower


temperature.
 Hot
 water
 really
 does
 dry


out
 your
 skin.


>> No,
 you
 can't
 take
 my
 hot
 water.


>> I
 know.
 And
 nobody
 likes
 to
 hear
 that.


>> Hot
 water
 dries
 out
 your
 skin.


>> It
 absolutely
 does.
 It
 softens
 the
 lipid


layer
 so
 that
 like
 your
 body
 loses


moisture
 more
 quickly.
 The
 most


incomprehensible
 thing
 to
 me,
 maybe
 in


all
 of
 the
 world,
 is
 the
 idea
 of
 getting


out
 of
 the
 shower,
 drying
 off,
 and
 then


just
 going
 about
 your
 day.
 Can
 you


imagine?


>> There
 are
 millions
 of
 us
 [laughter]
 that


can
 imagine.
 I
 can
 some
 days
 I
 am
 that


person.
 It's
 our
 producer
 Abigail.


>> Our
 producer's
 raising
 hand.
 We
 all


>> What
 and
 why?
 [laughter]


>> Some
 people
 don't
 feel
 dry
 and
 some


people
 don't
 have
 that.
 It's
 like
 a


muscle
 memory
 thing.
 That's
 your
 habit.


You're
 used
 to
 it.
 But
 there's
 plenty
 of


people
 that
 just
 go
 about
 their
 day.


[music]


How
 do
 things
 like
 age,
 pregnancy,


menopause
 change
 people's
 skin?
 I
 guess


number
 one,
 and
 moisturizing
 needs.


Yeah,
 generally
 the
 older
 you
 get,
 the


drier
 your
 skin
 gets.
 And
 they
 say
 that


the
 most
 hydrated
 will
 ever
 be
 is
 before


age
 40.
 So
 after
 that,
 you're
 starting


to
 get
 drier.
 Your
 skin
 doesn't
 retain


moisture
 as
 well.
 And
 then
 as
 far
 as


like
 how
 hormones
 affect
 your
 skin,
 this


is
 something
 that
 happens
 to
 all


genders.
 Like
 if
 your
 hormones
 are


fluctuating,
 that
 affects
 how
 your
 skin


looks
 and
 feels.
 So
 if
 you
 have
 changes


that
 are
 sudden,
 I
 would
 say
 talk
 to
 a


dermatologist.
 Like
 something
 could
 be


going
 on.


>> That's
 interesting.
 I
 feel
 like
 when


you're
 10,
 maybe
 turn
 down
 the


temperature
 of
 your
 shower.
 And
 then


when
 you're
 20,
 turn
 it
 down
 a
 couple


more
 degrees.
 And
 when
 you're
 30,
 turn


it
 down.
 And
 then
 by
 40,
 you'll
 be


tepid.
 And
 then
 cold
 water.
 You'll
 be


used
 to
 cold
 water.
 And
 then
 you
 don't


have
 to
 Yeah.
 worry
 about
 that
 moisture.


[laughter]


>> All
 right.
 I'm
 going
 to
 recap
 here.


Moisturizer
 is
 important.
 And
 [music]
 if


you
 are
 going
 to
 test
 out
 a
 moisturizer,


maybe
 test
 it
 out
 um
 certainly
 your
 body


before
 face.
 Facial
 moisturizer,
 body


moisturizer.
 Often
 times
 it's
 marketing


language
 that's
 differentiating
 the
 two.


[music]


But
 put
 this
 moisturizer
 on
 when
 your


skin
 is
 damp.
 Just
 do
 it.
 We
 are
 going


to
 take
 a
 quick
 break
 and
 when
 we
 come


back,
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 some
 myth


busting
 with
 Jen.
 Plus,
 we'll
 talk
 about


some
 key
 techniques
 you
 may
 not
 know


when
 it
 comes
 to
 really
 locking
 that


moisture
 in.
 Stick
 around.
 [music]


[music]


Welcome
 back.
 Our
 guest
 today
 is
 Jen


Sullivan,
 a
 senior
 editor
 on
 Wire


Cutters
 beauty
 team.
 Today's
 episode
 is


all
 about
 moisturizer.
 So,
 Jen,
 when


you're
 walking
 down
 a
 drugstore
 aisle,


there's
 so
 much
 to
 take
 in.
 You
 look


left
 and
 right
 and
 there
 are
 all
 these


marketing
 terms
 and
 all
 these
 really


pretty
 labels
 and
 you
 just
 don't
 know


what
 to
 pick.
 So,
 in
 your
 guide,
 it


mentions
 that
 every
 dermatologist
 who


was
 interviewed
 recommended
 looking
 for


three
 key
 ingredients
 and
 that's


hctants,
 emollients,
 and
 olusives.
 Can


you
 just
 break
 down
 quickly
 what
 each
 of


these
 are
 and
 basically
 what
 they
 do?


>> Hctants
 attract
 moisture
 to
 the
 skin


either
 from
 deeper
 in
 the
 skin
 or
 from


you
 know
 the
 environment.
 Occlusives


lock
 in
 moisture
 and
 then
 emollient
 are


actually
 skin
 softeners.
 Some
 of
 the


hctants
 can
 be
 an
 emollient.
 Some
 of
 the


olusives
 can
 be
 an
 emoleant
 but
 these


are
 the
 things
 that
 sort
 of
 make
 your


skin
 feel
 better.


>> Okay.
 Will
 it
 say
 that
 on
 the
 label
 for


each
 moisturizer?


>> It
 won't.
 But
 a
 hctant,
 again,
 the


things
 that
 attract
 moisture
 are
 things


like
 glycerin
 and
 hyaluronic
 acid.


>> Okay.


>> An
 olusive
 is
 that
 those
 are
 the
 locking


in
 ones.
 This
 kind
 of
 makes
 sense
 to
 me.


They're
 like
 the
 oils.
 They're
 the


thicker
 ones.
 They're
 the
 plant
 oils,


the
 shea
 butters,
 the
 petrol
 atoms,
 the


ones
 that
 like
 if
 you
 slathered
 it
 on,


it
 would
 make
 like
 a
 protective
 barrier.


Those
 are
 the
 olusive
 ingredients.
 And


then
 the
 emollients,
 those
 skin


softeners,


>> again,
 some
 of
 the
 things
 I
 just


mentioned
 can
 also
 be
 emollient,
 but


something
 like
 squaline
 is
 like
 a
 true


emollient.


>> Got
 it.
 And
 usually
 when
 you
 like
 you


don't
 have
 to
 look
 at
 the
 label
 and
 look


for
 any
 one
 of
 these
 things
 because
 the


odds
 are
 that
 they
 always
 have
 all


three.


>> Yes.
 And
 you
 can
 just
 go
 to
 our
 wire


cutter
 guide
 because
 all
 of
 our
 picks


have
 all
 three,


>> right?
 And
 you
 do
 the
 work
 for
 us.


>> Yeah.
 What
 a
 what
 a
 cheeky
 plug.
 Um
 what


are
 some
 other
 popular
 marketing


buzzwords
 that
 you
 might
 see
 or
 hear
 in


the
 drugstore
 beauty
 aisle?


>> Things
 that
 might
 sound
 important
 but


actually
 maybe
 aren't.
 How
 long
 do
 we


have?
 as
 much
 as
 as
 much
 time
 as
 you


want.


>> The
 names
 of
 these
 products,
 they're


like
 15
 words
 long
 and
 they're
 have
 a


complex
 and
 it
 brightens
 and
 then
 we've


got
 essences
 and
 we've
 got
 this
 and
 that


and
 it's
 all
 marketing.
 The
 majority
 of


those
 terms
 are
 not
 regulated.
 The
 one


that
 gets
 me
 is
 medical
 grade.
 A


cosmetic
 is
 a
 cosmetic.
 It
 is
 not
 a


medicine.
 Medical
 grade
 means
 nothing


with
 regards
 to
 skincare.
 Natural
 is


another
 one.
 Natural
 means
 nothing.


Glycerin
 is
 like,
 "Oo,
 it
 feels
 like


chemistry
 class."
 can
 be
 from
 a
 natural


source,
 but
 I
 get
 our
 instinct
 to
 want


something
 that
 feels
 more
 natural,
 feels


like
 I'm
 not
 putting
 an
 unnecessary


product
 on
 my
 body.
 So,
 I
 think
 that's


why
 companies
 use
 that
 word
 so
 much.
 And


they
 might
 themselves
 define
 it
 as


something
 that
 came
 from
 a
 plant-based


source,
 but
 there's
 no
 regulation
 in
 the


government
 as
 to
 what
 that
 means.
 So,
 it


depends
 on
 how
 the
 company
 is
 defining


the
 word
 themselves,


>> right?
 I
 plant-based
 is
 another
 thing


that
 you
 see
 I
 feel
 like
 and
 it's


without
 regulation
 it's
 hard
 to
 know


unless
 you
 go
 digging.
 Right.


>> Correct.
 Like
 squaline
 can
 be


plant-based.
 It
 can
 come
 from
 olives.


That's
 plant-based.
 Doesn't
 really
 sound


like
 something
 like
 coconut
 oil
 which


sounds
 truly
 plant-based.


>> Right,
 Jen?
 Most
 of
 the
 pics
 in
 our


guide
 are
 affordable
 drugstore
 brands.


They're
 very
 affordable.
 Like
 you
 won't


feel
 bad
 about
 buying
 them
 on
 the


regular
 because
 you're
 not
 spending
 a


bunch
 of
 money.
 But
 there
 are
 a
 couple


that
 just
 aren't.
 They
 are
 maybe
 $100


more.
 You
 have
 one,
 I
 think
 it's
 the


Augustus
 Bader
 Rich
 Cream,
 which
 sounds


expensive
 and
 it's
 like
 $300.
 Why
 would


somebody
 pay
 that
 much
 for
 something


that
 they
 could
 get
 for
 much
 cheaper


>> because
 they
 can
 afford
 to.
 [laughter]


>> Truly,
 I
 think
 the
 moisturizer
 you
 want


to
 use
 and
 that
 you
 like
 is
 based
 on


what
 is
 my
 budget,
 what
 am
 I
 looking


for,
 what
 I
 what
 am
 I
 going
 to
 know
 I


reach
 for
 again
 and
 again.
 I
 will
 say


the
 testers
 that
 tried
 that
 product


pretty
 much
 all
 loved
 it.
 It's
 a


luxurious
 experience.
 Yeah.
 And
 like
 you


want
 to
 feel
 good.
 It's
 the
 same
 with


like
 your
 food
 or
 your
 clothes
 or


whatever.
 There's
 all
 levels
 that
 you


can
 pay
 for.
 It's
 based
 on
 your
 own


budget,
 your
 own
 choices,
 where
 you
 want


to
 put
 your
 money.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 I


wouldn't
 judge
 that.
 And
 that
 product
 is


quite
 lovely.


>> But
 what
 makes
 it
 loveier
 than
 the
 rest?


>> The
 story
 that
 they're
 telling
 about
 it,


the
 bottle
 that
 it's
 in.
 You
 know,
 it


has
 some
 proprietary
 ingredients
 you


might
 not
 find
 in
 others.
 Maybe
 one
 of


those
 when
 you
 put
 it
 on
 your
 skin,
 you


were
 like,
 "This
 is
 the
 thing
 that


solved
 all
 my
 problems."


>> And
 if
 that's
 you
 and
 that
 product
 is


making
 your
 life
 better,
 go
 for
 it.


>> I
 like
 that.
 Okay.
 I'm
 not
 doing
 that,


but
 I
 appreciate.


>> And
 the
 testing,
 the
 testing
 is
 brand


concealed,
 right?
 So,


>> it
 depends
 on
 the
 guide.
 We
 sometimes
 do


two
 levels
 of
 testing.
 We
 first
 have
 our


guide
 writer
 test
 it
 themselves,
 and


they
 know
 what
 the
 brands
 are,
 and
 then


they
 brand
 conceal
 it
 for
 others.
 So,
 it


all
 depends
 on
 which
 guide
 we're
 talking


about.
 body
 lotions.
 We
 also
 have
 shower


gels,
 soaps.
 I
 mean,
 soaps
 was
 kind
 of


hard
 to
 brand
 conceal,
 but
 yeah,


[laughter]


>> this
 $300
 moisturizer,
 though,
 I
 mean,
 I


feel
 like
 if
 it's
 brand
 concealed
 and


people
 are
 loving
 it,
 it's
 compelling.


>> Yeah.


>> If
 you
 have
 $300
 to
 try


>> I
 mean,
 it's
 about
 texture
 for
 a
 lot
 of


people,
 too.
 Sometimes
 with
 a
 bit
 more


money,
 a
 company
 could
 create
 a
 better


texture
 because
 they're
 using


ingredients
 that
 cost
 more
 at
 raw


material
 level.
 I
 I
 won't
 say
 that


difference
 is
 from
 $10
 to
 $300.
 But


again,
 these
 companies
 are
 paying
 not


just
 for
 the
 raw
 materials
 that
 are
 in


the
 product.
 All
 that
 marketing,
 maybe


you
 heard
 about
 that
 product
 because
 you


saw
 it
 on
 Instagram.
 That
 didn't
 get


there
 out
 of
 nowhere.
 There
 was
 a


marketing
 budget
 put
 behind
 it.
 So
 often


times
 for
 a
 more
 expensive
 product,
 what


you're
 paying
 for
 maybe
 slightly
 is
 the


cost
 of
 goods
 being
 more,
 but
 definitely


the
 packaging
 because
 the
 packaging
 is


like
 heavier
 or
 it's
 glass
 or
 it
 looks


more
 beautiful.
 And
 definitely
 the


marketing
 of
 like,
 oh,
 I
 heard
 so
 and
 so


uses
 it
 or
 why
 is
 it
 always
 on
 my
 feed?


And
 that
 is
 what
 you're
 paying
 for.


>> So
 texture
 is
 a
 consideration
 for
 folks.


Another
 thing
 is
 how
 something
 smells.


So
 what
 I
 imagine
 is
 fragrance.
 How
 did


that
 factor
 into
 the
 testing?
 And
 what


are
 your
 thoughts
 there?
 Huge
 [snorts]


factor
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 Generally


speaking,
 if
 you
 have
 sensitive
 skin,


dermatologists
 say
 to
 look
 for


fragrancefree
 products,
 which
 means


there's
 no
 added
 fragrance.
 If
 you
 turn


them
 over,
 you
 won't
 see
 the
 word


parfoam
 or
 fragrance
 on
 the
 ingredient


label
 because
 these
 can
 be
 irritating.


They're
 not
 irritating
 for
 all
 people,


though.
 So,
 some
 of
 us
 like
 a
 scent


because
 it
 encourages
 us
 to
 use
 it.
 So,


they
 might
 have
 fragrance
 in
 them,
 and


that
 doesn't
 mean
 it's
 bad
 for
 you.


There's
 no
 inherent
 problem
 with
 it,


unless
 it
 causes
 you
 irritation.
 So,
 we


have
 picks
 that
 are
 both
 fragrance-free


and
 those
 that
 also
 are
 just
 traditional


and
 might
 have
 a
 fragrance
 in
 them.
 And


I
 imagine
 unscented
 is
 not
 fragrance


free.
 Oh,
 no.
 There's
 a
 big
 difference.


Fragrance
 free
 means
 like
 no
 fragrance


additives
 in
 there,
 which
 means
 actually


sometimes
 when
 you
 smell
 the
 product,


you'll
 smell
 something
 because
 you're


smelling
 those
 moisturizers.
 Sheay,
 for


example,
 has
 a
 scent
 to
 it.
 And
 if
 you


didn't
 add
 extra
 fragrances
 or
 masking


fragrances,
 you're
 going
 to
 smell
 the


sheay,
 but
 it
 will
 still
 be


fragrance-free.
 Unscented
 is
 different.


That's
 like
 they
 might
 only
 add
 a


fragrance
 that
 masks
 that
 she
 smell
 to


get
 them
 to
 a
 neutral
 place.
 So,


[clears throat]
 it
 kind
 of
 doesn't
 smell


like
 anything,
 but
 that
 doesn't
 mean


it's
 fragrance
 free.
 There
 is
 that


additive
 in
 there
 and
 it
 can
 still
 be


causing
 irritation.
 Got
 it.
 I
 think
 it


it
 is
 important
 back
 to
 this
 idea
 that


fragrance
 might
 not
 be
 an
 issue.
 Like,


you
 might
 not
 have
 sensitive
 skin.
 It's


sort
 of
 narrowing
 down
 what
 your
 skin


wants
 and
 what
 it
 doesn't
 want.
 And


sometimes
 the
 only
 way
 to
 do
 that
 is
 to


sort
 of
 do
 that
 consistent
 testing
 for


30
 days
 and
 figure
 out
 what's
 going
 on.


>> Exactly.
 And
 different
 fragrances
 affect


people
 differently.
 So,
 if
 you
 try
 one


scented
 or
 fragrance
 product
 and
 you


don't
 like
 it,
 doesn't
 immediately
 mean


anything
 with
 fragrance
 is
 bad
 for
 you


or
 it
 won't
 be
 good
 for
 you.
 I
 love
 it.


[music]


Which
 one
 do
 you
 use?
 What's
 your


favorite
 moisturizer
 from
 our
 guide?
 The


outsets
 moisturizer
 is
 my
 favorite
 face


and
 body.


>> Um,
 no.
 It's
 a
 smaller
 bottle,
 so
 I


would
 not
 use
 it
 on
 my
 body.
 It's
 $44


when
 it's
 not
 on
 sale.
 So,
 that's


another
 reason
 I
 would
 not
 use
 it
 on
 my


body.
 Um,
 but
 I
 really
 like
 it.


Actually,
 I
 started
 at
 Wire
 Cutter
 just


6
 months
 ago
 and
 I
 was
 so
 thrilled
 when


I
 got
 here
 that
 that
 was
 already
 a
 wire


cutter
 pick
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 [laughter]


"Yes,
 justified."
 But
 it
 has
 squaline
 in


it.
 It
 feels
 right
 down
 middle
 of
 the


road.
 Not
 too
 light,
 not
 too
 greasy.


It's
 nice
 glass
 bottle
 pump,
 simple


packaging.
 Um,
 I
 use
 it
 every
 day.


>> Love
 for
 a
 less
 expensive
 option.
 Vanic


cream.


>> Yeah,
 we
 love
 a
 van.


>> Shout
 out
 to
 Vanic
 Cream.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah,
 for
 me
 personally.
 Yeah.
 What


about
 body
 oils?
 I've
 seen
 these
 in
 the


drugstore.
 I've
 seen
 these
 on
 Instagram.


I've
 seen
 these
 in
 bathrooms
 of


>> I
 mean,
 I've
 seen
 people
 Tik
 Tok
 videos


about
 like
 the
 steps
 that
 you
 should


take
 in
 your
 just
 your
 moisturizing


routine.
 You
 have
 to
 do
 creamy
 and
 then


you
 have
 to
 lock
 in
 with
 an
 oil
 like
 and


then
 you
 have
 to
 do
 it
 all
 while
 you're


damp.
 Like,
 yeah,
 what
 about
 that?


>> Oils
 are
 not
 hydrating.
 I
 think
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 people
 also
 that
 look
 at
 like


moisturizer
 like
 I
 could
 just
 use


petroleum
 jelly
 or
 I
 could
 just
 use


olive
 oil
 from
 the
 bottle.
 Those
 are


olusives
 which
 we
 talked
 about
 earlier.


They're
 skin
 protectants.
 They
 lay
 down


on
 the
 top
 of
 the
 skin
 and
 keep
 the


moisture
 in
 there.
 But
 if
 you
 put
 them


on
 dry
 skin,
 what
 moisture
 are
 you


keeping
 in?
 You
 never
 put
 the
 moisture


in
 to
 begin
 with.
 So
 now
 you've
 just


locked
 in
 dry
 skin.
 You're
 protecting


your
 skin.
 So
 it
 might
 seem
 softer
 and


it
 might
 have
 an
 emollient
 factor.
 So
 it


like
 looks
 softer,
 feels
 softer,
 but


inherently
 underneath
 that
 olusive,
 it's


dry.
 So
 I
 think
 what
 you're
 seeing
 is


marketers
 would
 like
 you
 to
 put
 the


moisturizer
 on
 and
 then
 lock
 it
 in
 with


an
 oil.
 But
 going
 back
 to
 a
 good


moisturizer,
 it's
 going
 to
 have
 some
 of


those
 olusive
 ingredients
 already
 in
 it.


I
 like
 to
 do
 something
 with
 Hoba
 oil


because
 it's
 very
 cheap
 and
 I
 always


have
 access
 to
 it
 even
 when
 I'm


traveling.
 That
 particular
 oil,
 and
 this


is
 where
 it
 gets
 confusing,
 is
 both
 a


hctant
 and
 an
 olusive.
 And
 I'm
 sure


you've
 probably
 noticed
 that
 it
 has
 an


emollient
 property
 because
 it's


softening
 your
 skin.
 But
 when
 you
 use


multiple
 different
 kinds
 of
 these


ingredients
 we
 talked
 about,
 you're


getting
 a
 longerlasting
 kind
 of


hydration
 and
 I
 think
 it
 would
 be
 more


effective.
 So,
 it
 definitely
 works.
 And


if
 it's
 working
 for
 you,
 keep
 doing
 it.


I
 love
 a
 body
 oil
 and
 especially
 when


I'm
 outdoors.
 I
 like
 skiing.
 I
 like


hiking
 in
 the
 winter.
 I
 will
 put
 on


moisturizer
 and
 then
 put
 a
 layer
 of
 an


olusive
 such
 as
 Aquafor
 or
 Vaseline
 as


we
 were
 talking
 about
 petroleum
 jelly
 or


a
 face
 oil.
 The
 outset
 has
 a
 face
 oil
 I


add
 in
 in
 winter
 or
 the
 body
 oils
 you


were
 talking
 about.
 And
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


people
 feel
 more
 comfortable.
 Their
 skin


just
 feels
 nicer
 to
 them.
 They
 don't


have
 that
 like
 itchy
 tightness
 when
 they


do
 that
 extra
 step.
 And
 theoretically,


you're
 you
 are
 kind
 of
 locking
 in


whatever
 you've
 put
 on
 as
 a
 moisturizer.


It's
 an
 additional
 step
 and
 it
 might
 not


be
 needed
 necessarily,
 but
 it
 is


>> an
 extra
 lock,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 It's
 a
 value
 proposition
 in
 a
 way


because
 it
 keeps
 in
 that
 moisture
 you


put
 in
 and
 instead
 of
 applying


moisturizer
 seven
 times
 throughout
 the


day
 cuz
 I
 keep
 getting
 dry
 and
 I
 don't


know
 why
 and
 I
 put
 it
 back
 on.
 If
 you


locked
 it
 in
 in
 the
 morning
 with
 the
 oil


on
 top,
 that
 might
 work
 for
 you.


>> And
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 fly
 by
 something


that
 you've
 been
 pointing
 out
 throughout


this
 episode,
 which
 is
 that
 Aquaor
 or


petroleum
 jelly
 is
 not
 a
 moisturizer.


>> Yeah.
 Aquaor
 isn't
 pure
 petroleum
 jelly.


It
 has
 some
 other
 ingredients,
 but
 those


skin
 protectants
 they're
 called.
 Yeah.


They
 don't
 moisturize
 inherently.
 They


lock
 in
 the
 moisture
 like
 we
 said.
 So,


oh
 my
 gosh.
 I've
 been
 just
 putting


Aquafor
 on
 my
 daughter's
 body
 after
 like


bath
 time
 and
 thinking
 that
 that
 is
 the


moisture
 that
 she
 needs,
 the
 moisturizer


that
 she
 needs.


>> She
 might
 have
 water
 in
 her
 skin
 from


that
 bath
 and
 she
 has
 her
 own
 like
 skin


has
 oil
 glands.
 It
 has
 its
 own
 lipid


barrier
 and
 layer.
 Like
 there's


moisturizers
 in
 our
 skin
 naturally.


Natural
 moisturizing
 factors
 they're


called.
 So
 you
 are
 locking
 in
 something.


But
 I
 think
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 if


they're
 still
 dry
 and
 they
 keep


slathering
 on,
 you
 know,
 an
 Aquafor.


Yeah.


>> Just
 let
 your
 baby
 be
 ashy.


>> No.
 Then
 moisturize
 her
 first.


>> Now
 we
 know.


>> Slip
 that
 into
 my
 back
 pocket.


>> Can
 we
 talk
 order
 of
 operations?


>> We
 spoke
 about
 getting
 out
 of
 the


shower,
 getting
 out
 of
 the
 tub,


whatever.
 damp
 skin
 and
 then
 a


moisturizer.
 But
 what
 are
 the
 options
 in


terms
 of
 a
 routine


>> and
 what
 order
 is
 recommended?
 The
 basic


way
 to
 think
 about
 it
 is
 thinnest
 to


thickest.
 Thin
 products
 first,
 treatment


products
 first.
 If
 you
 use
 a
 retinol,


that
 would
 be
 like
 lower
 down
 earlier
 in


the
 process.
 Then
 your
 thicker
 products


like
 a
 moisturizer.
 And
 then
 at
 the
 end,


if
 maybe
 if
 you
 wanted
 the
 oil,
 that's


thicker
 than
 a
 moisturizer
 like
 a


lotion.
 And
 then
 the
 last
 one's
 always


sunscreen.
 But
 again,
 I
 don't
 know
 how


many
 pe
 I
 mean,
 I
 use
 like
 two
 things
 a


day,
 so
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 many.
 I
 think


this
 gets
 more
 complicated
 the
 more.


>> And
 do
 you
 follow
 that
 from
 thinnest
 to


thickest?
 Yeah,
 that's
 I
 think
 people


are
 worried
 like


>> fantastic
 skin.


>> Thank
 you.
 I
 work
 hard
 at
 it.
 I
 think


people
 get
 worried
 like,
 oh,
 if
 I
 do
 it


in
 the
 wrong
 order,
 it's
 going
 to
 negate


the
 effects
 of
 the
 other
 one.
 That's
 not


really
 a
 thing.
 I
 wouldn't
 worry
 about


that.
 It's
 more
 for
 uh
 comfort
 of
 skin


and
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 they
 don't
 peel,


which
 is
 when
 they
 get
 that
 little
 gummy


like
 rubber
 cement
 balls.
 I
 think
 of
 it


in
 my
 head.


>> [laughter]


>> I
 don't
 like
 that.


>> Yeah,
 nobody
 likes
 that.
 So,
 if
 that's


happening,
 you
 want
 to
 like
 slow
 down
 as


well.
 Like
 you
 put
 something
 on,
 let
 it


fully
 absorb
 and
 wait
 to
 put
 on
 the


next.


>> That
 was
 going
 to
 be
 my
 other
 question.


There's
 not
 like
 a
 standard
 amount
 of


time.
 You
 just
 got
 to
 let
 it
 absorb.


>> It's
 not
 really
 standard.
 Like
 I've


heard
 like,
 oh,
 wait
 a
 minute
 between


every
 product.
 I
 don't
 have
 I
 don't
 have


that
 time.
 I'm
 not
 sitting
 in
 front
 of
 a


mirror
 for
 60
 full
 seconds.
 Do
 you
 know


how
 long
 60
 seconds
 is?
 [laughter]
 No.


So,
 I
 think
 it's
 only
 if
 you're
 having


that
 pilling
 issue.
 And
 again,
 even


waiting
 might
 sometimes
 not
 fix
 that


issue.
 And
 if
 you
 wear
 makeup,
 that


might
 throw
 a
 wrench
 in
 things.
 So,
 you


might
 want
 to
 play
 around
 with
 that.
 But


generally,
 if
 you
 wait,
 you'll
 be
 less


likely
 to
 have
 that
 pilling
 effect.
 But


other
 than
 that,
 you
 don't
 necessarily


have
 to
 wait
 a
 long
 time
 between
 these


steps.
 I
 don't
 know if
 this
 is
 a
 fair


question,
 but
 does
 makeup
 often
 come


after
 this
 moisturizing
 routine?
 For


most
 people,
 I
 would
 say
 they're
 putting


they're
 doing
 their
 skincare
 routine
 or


moisturizing
 because
 moisturizer
 makes
 a


nice
 base
 for
 like
 something
 like
 a


foundation.
 We
 just
 came
 out
 with
 our


foundation
 guide
 um
 and
 we
 had
 everybody


test
 them
 after
 they
 did
 their
 their


regular
 skincare
 routine,
 whatever
 that


meant
 to
 them.
 So,
 yes,
 it
 would
 come


afterwards.


>> Got
 it.
 Okay.
 [music]


So,
 Jen,
 what
 if
 you
 are
 using
 the
 right


moisturizer
 for
 your
 skin
 supposedly,


but
 you
 just
 you
 feel
 like
 you're
 just


not
 hydrated
 enough?
 What
 are
 some
 other


things
 that
 you
 could
 do?


>> This
 is
 a
 great
 question
 because
 I
 think


we
 often
 just
 reach
 for
 a
 product
 to
 fix


whatever's
 going
 on
 with
 us.
 But
 like


eating
 good
 fats,
 making
 sure
 you're


hydrated,
 that
 will
 help
 with
 it.
 Taking


a
 slightly
 cooler
 shower.
 I'm
 not
 tell


telling
 anyone.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 That
 might


help.
 But
 these
 environmental
 factors,


adding
 a
 humidifier
 at
 night,
 like
 if


the
 air
 around
 you
 is
 dry,
 more
 moist


air,
 a
 humidifier
 could
 really
 help
 as


well.


>> Okay,
 let's
 do
 a
 little
 myth
 busting.


True
 or
 false?
 You
 should
 switch
 up
 your


moisturizer
 based
 on
 the
 season.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 go
 with
 depends
 on
 you
 and


your
 skin.
 Some
 people
 might
 not
 need
 to


do
 that.


>> Um,
 I
 tend
 to
 find
 a
 thicker
 moisturizer


in
 the
 winter
 cuz
 my
 skin
 gets
 drier,


but
 it's
 all
 depending
 on
 your


preferences
 and
 your
 skin
 type.


>> Got
 it.
 All right.
 True
 or
 false?
 you


should
 buy
 a
 separate
 eye
 cream
 because


facial
 moisturizer
 doesn't
 do
 enough
 to


firm
 up
 that
 area
 on
 its
 own.
 One
 quick


clarification,
 firm
 up
 isn't
 something


that
 a
 moisturizer
 does.
 It
 moisturizes,


it
 hydrates.
 It's
 not
 necessarily
 like


making
 skin
 feel
 firmer
 and
 tighter.


>> What
 is
 an
 eye
 cream
 doing?


>> An
 eye
 cream.
 So,
 if
 your
 moisturizer


can
 go
 around
 your
 eyes,
 say
 you
 have


dryness
 around
 your
 eyes,
 and
 you
 can


get
 your
 moisturizer
 up
 there
 without


any
 sort
 of
 irritation,
 you
 might
 not


need
 an
 eye
 cream.
 Some
 people
 can't.


They
 need
 a
 gentler
 formula.
 But
 a
 lot


of
 the
 eye
 creams,
 and
 we're
 actually


working
 on
 testing
 eye
 creams
 and


treatments
 right
 now,
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 are


for
 specific
 concerns,
 like
 I
 have
 a


little
 bit
 of
 fine
 lines
 and
 texture.
 I


have
 a
 darker
 under
 eye
 circle.
 I
 have


puffiness.
 I
 have
 saggginess.
 Those
 are


the
 things
 that
 you're
 going to
 need.


Activives
 I
 talked
 about
 earlier,
 like


it's
 your
 moisturizer,
 but
 with
 a
 little


extra
 something
 in
 to
 address
 that
 need.


And
 one
 of
 those
 needs
 could
 be


hydration.
 Like,
 I
 need
 extra
 moisture


in
 my
 eye
 area.
 Then
 maybe
 yeah,
 you


would
 need
 an
 eye
 cream.


>> True
 or
 false?
 You
 cannot
 over


moisturize
 your
 skin.


>> I
 mean,
 you
 can't
 drown
 your
 skin,
 but
 I


would
 say
 false
 because
 if
 you're


putting
 on
 too
 much
 moisturizer
 and


you're
 feeling
 greasy
 or
 you
 see
 your


skin
 is
 uh
 breaking
 out,
 maybe
 you've


caused
 like
 some
 clogged
 pores
 there
 and


you're
 getting
 some
 acne
 type
 bumps,
 you


might
 be
 over
 moisturizing.
 So,
 that


could
 be
 possible.


>> All right.
 True
 or
 false?
 If
 it
 tingles


when
 you
 apply
 it
 to
 your
 skin,
 that's


how
 you
 know
 it's
 working.


I'm
 going
 to
 say
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 false


because
 I
 think
 people
 think
 it
 does


nothing
 unless
 they
 can
 feel
 it
 doing


something.
 And
 in
 some
 cases,
 it's
 fine


to
 have
 the
 tingle,
 but
 in
 many
 cases,


the
 tingle
 is
 a
 sign
 that
 you
 are


irritating
 your
 skin.
 That's
 what
 that


tingle
 is.
 So,
 it
 might
 actually
 be
 a


bad
 thing.
 Keep
 an
 eye
 on
 the
 tingle.


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 let
 you
 ask
 this
 last


question,
 uh,
 Kyra,
 because
 I
 already


know
 the
 answer
 to
 it
 from


>> carefully
 listening
 to
 Jen
 throughout


this
 episode.
 And
 the
 question
 was
 going


to
 be
 true
 or
 false.
 Aquaor
 is
 the
 best


moisturizer.
 Not
 only
 is
 it
 not
 the
 best


moisturizer,
 it's
 not
 a
 moisturizer
 at


all.


>> Moisturizer.


>> We
 all
 learned
 something.


>> We
 all
 learned
 something
 here
 today.


[laughter]


>> Okay.
 So,
 we've
 gotten
 to
 our
 last


question.
 Jen,
 before
 we
 wrap,
 we
 always


ask
 our
 guests
 one
 final
 question,
 which


is,
 what's
 the
 last
 thing
 you've
 bought


that
 you've
 really
 loved?
 Does
 not
 have


to
 be
 a
 wire
 cutter
 pick.
 It's
 actually


these
 shoes
 I'm
 wearing
 right
 now.
 This


is
 the
 part
 of
 the
 show
 where
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 complain
 about
 my
 feet
 hurt.
 My


feet
 hurt.
 all
 the
 time.


>> Get
 it?


>> And
 so
 in
 the
 summer,
 I'm
 a
 Birkenstock


person,
 but
 you
 can't
 wear
 Birkenstocks


in
 the
 winter.
 And
 I
 also
 like
 Fit


Flops.
 Fit
 Flops.


>> Fit
 Flops.


>> What
 is
 a
 Fit
 Flop?


>> A
 Fit
 Flop
 is
 a
 brand
 name
 for
 this
 like


orthopedic
 looking
 kind
 of
 sandal.
 This


is
 a
 Fit
 Flop.
 So
 it
 has
 the
 Fit
 Flop


base
 on
 under
 my
 foot,
 so
 it's
 real


comfortable,
 but
 then
 it
 looks
 like


>> a
 Doc
 It
 looks
 like
 a
 Doc
 Martin.
 It


looks
 like
 a
 Doc,
 which
 is
 another
 shoe


that
 like
 they
 Doc
 Martens
 are
 heavy,


though.
 This
 is
 ridiculous.
 I'm
 getting


my
 shoe
 off
 right
 now.
 Feel
 this
 thing.


for
 how
 big
 and
 chunky
 this
 looks.


>> It
 is
 like
 a
 two-tiered
 soul


>> and
 it's
 really
 light.
 It's
 really
 It's


like
 light
 as
 a
 croc.


>> So,
 Fit
 Flops
 also
 if
 you
 have
 Yeah.


feet
 that
 are
 always
 in
 pain,
 try
 them.


>> So,
 what's
 the
 model?


>> The
 model
 of
 this
 Fit
 Flop
 is
 the
 F
 mode


leather
 platform
 Chelsea
 boot.
 So,
 it


looks
 like
 a
 Chelsea
 boot
 with
 a
 chunky


platform
 sole
 and
 this
 FitFlop
 base.


It's
 going
 to
 give
 you
 some
 height,
 too.


>> Yeah,


>> I
 love
 that.


>> Yeah,
 I
 love
 that
 [laughter]
 for
 you.
 I


love
 that
 for
 you,
 Jen.
 Thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 joining
 us.
 was
 very


illuminating
 for
 me
 personally,
 but
 I


hope
 will
 be
 helpful
 for
 our
 listeners,


too.
 Thanks
 so
 much.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Kyra,
 what
 did
 you
 learn
 today
 at


school?


>> Oh
 my
 gosh.
 Well,
 I've
 learned
 that
 I


don't
 have
 to
 be
 soaking
 wet
 to
 put
 on


my
 moisturizer.


>> No,
 you
 don't,
 my
 friend.


>> I
 I've
 been
 struggling.
 I
 really
 have.
 I


track
 water
 all
 through
 my
 house
 cuz
 I


got
 to
 put
 on
 my
 moisturizer
 before
 I


dry
 out.
 [laughter]


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 firmly


towel
 off
 before
 I
 start
 my
 entire


skincare
 routine
 and
 I
 feel
 freer
 for


that.
 It's
 a
 game
 changer
 for
 you,


buddy.


>> Huge.
 What
 about
 you?


>> For
 me,
 I
 think
 when
 picking
 a


moisturizer,
 you
 want
 to
 look
 for


hydrating
 ingredients.
 You
 want
 to
 look


for
 things
 like
 hctants,
 which
 attract


moisture,
 so
 like
 glycerin,
 hyaluronic


acid.
 You
 want
 to
 look
 for
 olusives
 that


lock
 in
 moisturizer.
 So,
 that
 might
 be


plant
 oils
 and
 ceramides.
 And
 then
 you


also
 want
 to
 look
 for
 emollient
 and


those
 are
 going
 to
 soften
 skin
 like


squaline.
 So
 that
 was
 a
 big
 learn
 and
 a


big
 takeaway
 for
 me.
 The
 other
 that's


sort
 of
 turning
 things
 upside
 down
 for


me
 is
 that
 olusives
 are
 not


moisturizers.


>> That
 one's
 going to
 haunt
 you.
 Huh.


>> And
 said
 in
 a
 different
 way,
 Aquafor
 is


not
 a
 moisturizer.
 Vaseline
 is
 not
 a


moisturizer.


>> Yeah.
 Now
 you
 know.
