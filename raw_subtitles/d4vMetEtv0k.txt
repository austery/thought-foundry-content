For
 a
 lot
 of
 us,
 this
 is
 a
 moment
 when


questions
 of
 family
 come
 into
 sharper


focus.
 Who
 do
 we
 gather
 with?
 Who


supports
 us?
 Who
 do
 we
 choose?
 And
 who


chooses
 us?
 And
 for
 some
 of
 us,
 those


answers
 might
 feel
 wonderfully
 clear,


but
 for
 others,
 there
 might
 be
 a


tenderness
 around
 this
 or
 a
 sense
 that


your
 answers
 aren't
 quite
 what
 tradition


tells
 you
 they
 should
 be.
 And
 that's
 why


our
 guest
 today
 feels
 especially


essential
 right
 now.
 She's
 a
 journalist


and
 author
 of
 the
 other
 significant


others.
 And
 last
 year,
 she
 delivered
 a


TED
 talk
 that
 pushed
 us
 to
 expand
 who
 we


count
 as
 our
 people
 and
 to
 recognize
 the


deep
 sustaining
 connections
 that
 don't


always
 fit
 neatly
 onto
 holiday
 cards
 or


family
 trees,
 but
 can
 shape
 our
 lives
 in


very
 profound
 ways.
 I'm
 so
 grateful


she's
 here
 to
 help
 us
 reflect
 on


belonging,
 connection,
 and
 relationships


that
 can
 carry
 us
 into
 this
 season
 and


well
 beyond
 it.
 Please
 give
 a
 welcome
 to


Raina
 Cohen.
 What
 a
 nice
 intro.
 Thanks,


Whitney.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 just
 maybe
 to
 kick
 things


off,
 your
 your
 talk,
 the
 talk
 that
 you


delivered
 on
 the
 TED
 stage
 is
 is
 sort
 of


a
 distillation
 of
 the
 big
 idea
 from
 your


book,
 The
 Other
 Significant
 Others,
 that


essentially
 argues
 for
 a
 more
 expansive


approach
 to
 friendship
 and
 the
 role
 it


can
 play
 for
 all
 of
 us.
 And
 to
 pull
 a


quote
 uh
 from
 the
 book,
 you
 say,
 "If
 we


don't
 limit
 friendship,
 it
 can
 be


central
 to
 our
 lives."
 So,
 for
 those
 of


us
 who
 aren't
 familiar,
 as
 a
 a
 primer,
 I


think
 for
 our
 conversation,
 what
 do
 you


what
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 this?
 How
 are
 we


limiting
 friendship?
 And
 how
 could
 we


think
 about
 it
 more
 fully?


>> I
 think
 we
 limit
 friendship
 by
 thinking


it
 can
 do
 less
 than
 it
 actually
 can.
 And


one
 of
 the
 ways
 that
 feels
 really
 clear


is
 by
 looking
 across
 time
 and
 across


places
 and
 seeing
 what
 friendship
 looked


like
 in
 those
 times
 and
 places.
 And
 it


was
 different.
 Uh
 for
 one
 thing,
 I
 think


the
 expectation
 now
 is
 that
 friendship


uh
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 relationship
 that's


private.
 It's
 just
 between
 you
 and


someone
 else
 or
 maybe
 it's
 a
 small
 group


of
 people
 and
 it
 is
 a
 a
 nice
 addition
 to


your
 life
 but
 it
 is
 not
 an
 essential


part
 of
 your
 life.
 It's
 something
 that


you
 can
 you
 know
 maybe
 uh
 put
 on
 the


back
 burner
 and
 that
 was
 just
 not
 true


in
 in
 many
 other
 places.
 I
 mean
 you
 you


can
 uh
 see
 that
 there
 were
 rituals
 that


were
 built
 around
 recognizing
 friendship


uh
 potentially
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 your


life.
 There
 uh
 an
 example
 of
 this
 ritual


is
 called
 sworn
 brotherhood.
 Um
 and
 it


was
 recognized
 as
 uh
 something
 that


people
 would
 uh
 would
 witness
 like
 that


that
 commitment.
 We
 don't
 think
 about


friendship
 as
 involving
 commitment
 let


alone
 a
 commitment
 that
 you
 are
 going
 to


formalize
 in
 front
 of
 other
 people.
 Um,


so
 I
 think
 even
 the
 idea
 of
 commitment


is
 something
 that
 would
 surprise
 a
 lot


of
 people.
 And
 then
 I
 think
 the
 kinds
 of


feelings
 that
 we
 think
 are
 possible
 to


experience
 in
 friendship
 are
 also
 kind


of
 limited.
 That
 we
 hold
 out
 romantic


relationships
 as
 the
 relationship
 where


you
 can
 experience
 excitement
 and


infatuation.


um
 and
 the
 you
 know
 the
 sort
 of
 fluttery


feelings
 that
 actually
 friends
 can


experience.
 I
 can
 you
 know
 can
 talk


about
 my
 own
 experience
 with
 this.
 It's


partly
 what
 what
 led
 me
 to
 write
 the


book.
 Um
 but
 again
 if
 you
 look
 across


different
 times
 and
 and
 places
 you
 will


see
 that
 kind
 of
 affection
 where
 friends


um
 would
 talk
 about
 loving
 each
 other


and
 that's
 that
 was
 uh
 obvious
 that
 you


would
 love
 your
 friends
 and
 I
 think
 um


especially
 you
 know
 we're
 talking
 about


certain
 subsets
 of
 society
 it's
 uh
 not


that
 common
 to
 talk
 in
 that
 language
 of


love
 or
 to
 snuggle
 up
 to
 your
 friend


without
 that
 being
 a
 question
 of
 you


know
 are
 you
 romantically
 involved.
 So
 I


think
 between
 the
 idea
 that
 friendship


is
 private,
 that
 it
 doesn't
 uh
 it
 should


be
 easy,
 it
 shouldn't
 necessarily


involve
 commitment,
 um
 and
 that
 there


are
 there's
 kind
 of
 a
 cap
 on
 how
 intense


the
 emotional
 experience
 might
 be.
 All


of
 those
 are
 ways
 that
 we
 I
 think


underestimate
 what
 friendship
 can
 can
 be


and
 do
 for
 our
 lives.


>> And
 you
 you
 mentioned
 just
 now
 that
 you


have
 sort
 of
 a
 personal
 connection
 to


this.
 Can
 you
 tell
 us
 a
 little
 bit
 more


about
 why
 you
 wrote
 the
 book
 and
 and
 and


then
 ultimately
 gave
 the
 talk?
 So,
 I


found
 myself
 in
 a
 friendship
 that
 really


broke
 the
 definition
 of
 friendship
 that


I
 thought
 was,
 you
 know,
 what
 it
 was


supposed
 to
 be.
 And,
 uh,
 this
 happened


in
 my
 early
 20s
 and
 I
 ended
 up
 meeting
 a


friend
 who,
 it
 turned
 out
 lived
 5


minutes
 uh,
 a
 five-minute
 walk
 away
 from


me.
 And
 we
 became
 much
 more
 intertwined


in
 each
 other's
 lives
 uh,
 than
 I
 had
 ex


I
 had
 experienced
 maybe
 something


somewhat
 comparable.
 um
 a
 couple
 of


times,
 but
 we
 found
 ourselves
 struggling


with
 even
 the
 language
 of
 best
 friend


that
 that
 felt
 inadequate
 that
 something


more
 like
 partners
 maybe
 fit.
 And
 I


found
 myself
 thinking
 about
 other
 people


that
 I
 had
 known
 at
 different
 points
 in


my
 life
 who
 had
 these
 really
 intense,


devoted
 friendships
 that
 didn't
 kind
 of


um
 couldn't
 be
 captured
 with
 the
 term


friend
 or
 best
 friend.
 And
 then
 I
 looked


to
 history,
 some
 of
 what
 I
 was
 just


talking
 about
 before,
 and
 realized
 that


we
 have
 a
 really
 specific
 idea
 about


what
 friendship
 is
 now.
 And
 I
 wanted
 to


find
 people
 today
 who
 had
 these
 kinds
 of


friendships.
 And
 essentially
 over
 the


course
 of
 those
 interviews,
 I
 realized


that
 this
 wasn't
 just
 a
 project
 to
 lift


up
 and
 help
 people
 recognize
 that
 there


were
 these
 extremely
 close
 friendships


that
 I
 called
 Platonic
 partnerships,
 but


that
 because
 they
 they
 challenged
 the


definition
 of
 friendship
 by
 blending


together
 kinds
 of
 elements
 of


partnership
 and
 platonic
 friendship
 that


they
 ended
 up
 asking
 all
 these
 bigger


questions
 about
 how
 do
 we,
 you
 know,


know
 that
 a
 that
 uh
 a
 romantic


relationship
 is
 romantic?
 Why
 are


romantic
 relationships
 held
 up
 higher


than
 friendships
 by
 default?
 Like
 how
 do


we
 define
 what
 family
 is?
 How
 does
 the


state
 define
 what
 an
 important


relationship
 is?
 So
 basically
 like
 it


started
 from
 this
 personal
 place,
 but


all
 these
 bigger
 questions
 came
 up
 for


me
 that
 I
 wanted
 to
 tackle
 in
 a
 book.


>> And
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 important
 to


note
 that
 this
 this
 isn't
 an
 argument


against
 romantic
 relationships.
 You're


not
 suggesting
 that
 you
 have
 either
 or,


right?


>> No.
 Absolutely
 not.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 uh
 I
 try


to
 be
 really
 careful
 in
 in
 a
 number
 of


ways
 to
 say
 that
 it's
 not
 either
 or.
 I


think
 um
 that
 would
 be
 kind
 of
 using
 the


same
 logic
 that
 I
 am
 trying
 to
 push


against
 the
 idea
 that
 there's
 one
 right


way
 to
 live.
 Um
 I
 think
 currently
 the


message
 we
 get
 is
 that
 the
 right
 way
 to


live
 is
 to
 find
 a
 romantic
 partner,


maybe
 have
 kids,
 um
 you
 know,
 to
 not
 be


alone.
 And
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 say
 that


there's
 that
 that's
 that
 one
 right
 way


is
 wrong,
 but
 I
 have
 found
 the
 other
 one


right
 way.
 I
 think
 the
 the
 bigger
 point


is
 that
 there
 are
 a
 variety
 of
 ways
 to


live
 deeply
 meaningful
 lives
 and
 that


building
 your
 life
 around
 a
 friendship


or
 many
 friendships
 or
 some
 other
 kind


of
 combo
 of
 things
 um
 can
 be
 really


important.
 Um
 and
 in
 fact
 there
 are


people
 who
 I
 profile
 in
 the
 book
 who


have
 both
 a
 romantic
 partner
 and
 this


really
 close
 friendship.
 Um,
 and
 I


explore
 the
 ways
 that
 those
 those


different
 types
 of
 relationships
 can


actually
 complement
 each
 other.
 Like
 it


can
 make
 a
 romantic
 relationship


stronger
 to
 have
 a
 really
 close


friendship
 like
 this
 in
 your
 life.
 So,
 I


definitely
 don't
 see
 it
 as
 either
 or.


>> Hearing
 all
 of
 the
 things
 that
 you've


researched
 and
 all
 the
 people
 you've


encountered,
 it's
 it's
 it
 feels
 like
 you


have
 just
 sort
 of
 this
 treasure
 trove
 of


learnings
 and
 how
 you
 can
 think
 about


friendship
 as
 sort
 of
 a
 primary
 maybe


even
 foundational
 relationship.
 And
 I'm


curious
 to
 hear
 what
 you've
 learned
 um


about
 what
 can
 become
 possible
 for


people
 when
 we
 do
 remove
 the
 limits
 from


friendship
 and
 how
 it
 can
 function
 and


how
 have
 you
 seen
 people's
 lives
 improve


um
 as
 a
 result
 of
 doing
 this?
 A
 really


big
 lesson
 I
 got
 um
 interviewing
 many


dozens
 of
 people
 was
 that
 life
 takes
 you


by
 surprise.
 And
 if
 you
 only
 have


one
 one
 way
 that
 you
 are
 told
 is


possible
 to
 live
 live
 your
 life
 and
 to


be
 happy,
 it's
 just
 not
 that
 resilient


to
 all
 of
 the
 things
 that
 can
 come
 up


which
 range
 from
 wanting
 a
 romantic


partner
 and
 not
 being
 able
 to
 find
 one


to
 having
 a
 romantic
 partner
 and


splitting
 up
 uh
 to
 having
 a
 kid
 with


serious
 disabilities.
 Um,
 I
 mean
 there's


sort
 of
 any
 number
 of
 things
 that
 I
 saw


people
 struggle
 with
 and
 what
 made
 them


be
 able
 to
 move
 into
 a
 life
 that
 felt


really
 full
 to
 them
 was
 being
 open
 to


the
 possibility
 that
 a
 friend
 could


could
 be
 there,
 could
 be
 the
 backs
 stop


when
 things
 went
 wrong.
 Um,
 you
 know,


one
 I
 mean
 I
 write
 about
 women
 a
 woman


who
 was
 dying
 of
 ovarian
 cancer
 and
 her


friend
 was
 really
 her
 primary
 caretaker.


um
 and
 you
 know
 her
 husband
 was
 not
 kind


of
 in
 the
 position
 to
 help
 especially


with
 the
 kids.
 It's
 like
 having
 um
 a


wider
 safety
 net
 when
 uh
 whether
 it's


something
 that's
 acute
 or
 is
 just
 like


your
 life
 didn't
 quite
 fit
 on
 the
 train


tracks
 you
 expected.
 Uh
 it
 it's
 just


this
 this
 great
 way
 to
 um
 to
 still
 find


a
 lot
 of
 meaning.
 And
 even
 for
 people


whose
 lives
 don't
 take
 um
 a
 turn
 that


maybe
 they
 wouldn't
 have
 chosen
 really


benefit
 from
 having
 deep
 friendships
 um


because
 they
 it
 means
 that
 they
 have


more
 than
 one
 person
 in
 their
 life
 who


can
 unlock
 a
 different
 side
 of
 them.
 I


mean
 I
 think
 about
 one
 of
 my
 friends
 who


I'm
 just
 constantly
 laughing
 around.
 Um,


and
 I
 had
 had
 her
 and
 another
 friend


like
 hang
 out
 and
 I
 realized
 that
 one
 of


my
 friends
 who
 brings
 out
 this
 really


contemplative
 side
 of
 me
 had
 probably


never
 seen
 me
 laugh
 as
 much
 I
 as
 I
 had


then.
 So,
 I
 think
 also
 being
 open
 to
 the


idea
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 um
 more


than
 one
 really
 significant
 relationship


in
 your
 life
 means
 that
 you
 have
 people


who
 help
 you
 kind
 of
 figure
 out
 the
 like


fuller
 well-rounded
 version
 of
 yourself.


You
 know,
 I
 think
 there's
 been
 so
 much


written
 these
 days
 about
 the
 challenges


adults
 face
 and
 maintaining


strong
 relationships,
 platonic


relationships
 across
 different
 life


events.
 You
 know,
 whether
 that's


relocation
 or
 marriage
 or
 children
 and


uh
 and
 I
 I
 personally
 know
 that
 I've


experienced
 some
 of
 these
 challenges
 as


I've
 gotten
 older.
 What
 do
 you
 see
 as


some
 of
 the
 biggest
 barriers
 to


developing
 these
 types
 of
 relationships


and
 and
 how
 do
 you
 recommend
 people


overcome
 them?


Well,
 one
 way
 to
 answer
 that
 is
 to
 think


about
 what
 are
 the
 ingredients
 of
 a


thriving
 friendship
 or
 thrive
 I
 mean


individual
 friendships
 and
 this
 probably


also
 applies
 to
 community
 and
 a
 research


I
 talked
 to
 from
 um
 the
 University
 of


Utah
 said
 that
 the
 three
 magic


ingredients
 of
 she
 was
 talking
 about


attachment
 so
 like
 any
 kind
 of
 close


relationship
 were
 time
 togetherness
 and


touch


>> so
 if
 we
 work
 backwards
 from
 there
 it's


like
 How
 um
 how
 much
 time
 are
 we
 able
 to


spend
 with
 other
 people?
 Well,
 if
 we


live
 far
 from
 our
 friends
 or
 potential


friends,
 if
 the
 priority
 we
 have
 is


having
 a
 house
 that,
 you
 know,
 we
 can


keep
 to
 ourselves
 or
 there
 are
 problems


with
 affordability,
 for
 instance,
 um


when
 we're
 trying
 to
 to
 figure
 out
 where


to
 live,
 uh
 that's
 going
 to
 reduce
 the


amount
 of
 time
 we
 have.
 Same
 thing
 for


if
 we're
 working
 all
 the
 time.
 Um


togetherness
 is
 um
 also
 about
 like
 just


sharing
 life
 together.
 And
 if
 the
 way


that
 we
 are
 maybe
 inclined
 to
 um
 spend


time
 together
 because
 this
 is
 what's


normal
 is
 to
 like
 go
 get
 coffee
 or
 do
 an


activity
 and
 um
 and
 not
 just
 let
 people


into
 our
 everyday
 lives
 because
 that


would
 be
 uh
 you
 know
 like
 going
 and


doing
 errands
 for
 instance
 um
 because


that
 would
 be
 boring
 or
 not
 appropriate.


that
 also
 can
 be
 a
 barrier.
 Um,
 and
 uh,


and
 as
 well
 as
 if
 you
 think
 you're


supposed
 to
 be
 kind
 of
 um,
 doing
 any


activity
 of
 significance
 with
 your
 with


a
 romantic
 partner
 um,
 as
 opposed
 to
 a


friend,
 that
 can
 can
 be
 difficult
 uh,


for
 friendship.
 And
 then
 the
 third
 thing


would
 be
 is
 touch.
 You
 know,
 there's


certainly
 norms
 that
 we
 have
 around
 how


close
 you
 can
 get
 to
 your
 friends.
 Um,


as
 I,
 you
 know,
 mentioned
 before,
 I


think,
 um,
 straight
 men
 really
 bear
 the


brunt
 of
 this,
 that,
 uh,
 this
 is
 why
 you


see
 the
 side
 hugs
 and,
 uh,
 as
 opposed
 to


like
 a
 full-on
 hug
 or,
 you
 know,
 see


handshakes
 or
 one,
 um,
 one
 man
 I


interviewed
 said
 that
 his
 his
 father


won't
 even
 sit
 next
 to
 him
 right
 next
 to


him
 on
 the
 couch.
 He
 has
 to
 leave
 space


and
 all
 of
 his
 friends
 would
 do
 the
 same


um,
 before
 he
 sort
 of
 had
 this
 other


friendship.
 Um,
 so
 I
 think
 the
 the
 kind


of
 um
 those
 sorts
 of
 uh
 barriers
 around


touch,
 norms
 of
 touch
 um
 can
 also
 get
 in


the
 way.
 Um,
 and
 there
 there
 are
 plenty


of
 other
 things
 too
 that
 I
 think
 get
 at


the
 idea
 that
 friendship
 is
 supposed
 to


be
 easy.
 Um,
 that
 we
 shouldn't,
 you


know,
 be
 inconvenienced
 or
 inconvenience


others.
 Um,
 that
 those
 are
 a
 few
 of
 the


I
 think
 the
 barriers
 that
 that
 come
 into


um
 getting
 closer.
 H.
 So,
 so
 then
 if


someone
 were
 really
 interested
 in


developing
 more
 intentional
 platonic


relationships
 that
 are
 deeper
 than


friendship
 as
 you're
 describing,
 what


would
 be
 some
 of
 the
 steps
 you'd


recommend
 people
 take
 to
 to
 practice


this
 in
 their
 in
 their
 lives
 with


existing
 friends?
 Let's
 start
 there.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 one
 is
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do


you
 get
 more
 time
 together?
 And
 uh
 one


thing
 that
 might
 sound
 simple
 but
 uh
 is


really
 helpful
 is
 having
 recurring
 ways


to
 see
 friends.
 So,
 I
 have
 a
 friend
 who


has
 two
 young
 children
 and
 is
 really


bound
 um
 to
 her
 house
 and
 like
 there's
 a


day
 of
 the
 week
 when
 her
 husband
 is
 um


has
 choir
 practice
 and
 uh
 every
 other


week
 I
 come
 by
 after
 her
 kids
 are
 in
 bed


and
 we
 hang
 out
 at
 the
 house
 um
 and
 it's


like
 built
 into
 our
 calendars
 and
 even


if
 one
 of
 us
 is
 unavailable,
 traveling,


whatever,
 um
 we
 have
 this
 expectation
 of


how
 much
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 each
 other


uh
 that
 I
 I
 think
 you
 can
 lose
 track
 of


if
 you,
 you
 know,
 see
 somebody
 once,
 you


don't
 make
 plans
 uh
 immediately
 and
 then


then
 a
 month
 or
 two
 or
 three
 passes.
 Um,


another
 way
 that
 I've
 I've
 done
 this
 is


to
 plan
 the
 next
 time
 you're
 going
 to


see
 the
 person
 before
 you
 leave
 your


like
 the
 the
 existing
 interaction.
 So,


if
 you're,
 you
 know,
 at
 dinner,
 um,
 get


out
 your
 calendars
 and
 and
 figure
 out


the
 next
 time.
 Um,
 so
 that
 that's
 sort


of
 like
 one
 thing
 that
 I
 would


recommend.
 Uh
 I
 think
 on
 this
 the
 idea


of
 like
 what
 is
 acceptable
 to
 ask
 of
 a


friend
 or
 do
 for
 a
 friend
 I
 I
 think


trying
 to
 experiment
 with
 asking
 for


help
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 or
 at least


telling
 people
 when
 you're
 in
 a
 you're


having
 you
 know
 a
 low
 mood
 being
 open


about
 the
 parts
 of
 your
 life
 that
 are


not
 polished.
 Uh
 it
 invites
 other
 people


to
 then
 share
 those
 things
 with
 you.
 Uh


I've,
 you
 know,
 I've
 seen
 this
 um
 play


out
 with
 people
 in
 my
 my
 own
 life
 that


uh
 sharing
 something
 that
 is
 vulnerable


becomes
 an
 invitation
 and
 then
 that
 kind


of
 uh
 is
 a
 flywheel
 that
 can
 bring
 you


closer.


>> Uh
 and
 then
 the
 last
 suggestion
 I'll


give
 is
 a
 more
 radical
 one.
 Um
 but
 maybe


something
 to
 consider.


Uh
 I
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 I
 really
 believe
 in


the
 idea
 that
 we
 should
 take
 friendship


more
 seriously.
 We
 shouldn't
 run
 away
 at


the
 first
 difficulty.
 We
 should
 try
 to


have
 um
 you
 know
 harder
 conversations
 um


and
 make
 be
 intentional.
 But
 on
 the


other
 hand,
 I
 think
 that
 there
 are
 ways


that
 we
 we
 make
 friendship
 harder
 than


it
 needs
 to
 be
 because
 we
 have
 oriented


so
 many
 of
 us
 our
 lives
 around
 a


different
 set
 of
 priorities
 which
 might


be
 as
 you
 know
 the
 the
 idea
 that
 like


you
 want
 to
 have
 everything
 to
 yourself.


you
 want
 to
 have
 a
 home
 that
 you
 have


control
 over
 or
 you
 make
 a
 decision


about
 where
 to
 live
 so
 that
 it's
 as


close
 to
 work
 as
 possible
 or
 um
 you
 know


any
 any
 number
 of
 other
 kinds
 of
 uh


priorities
 and
 then
 we
 accept
 that
 uh


we're
 just
 going
 to
 have
 some
 social


deprivation
 as
 part
 of
 it.
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 actually
 I
 say
 accept
 but
 I'm
 not


sure
 that
 people
 are
 even
 conscious
 of


it
 that
 there's
 this
 this
 huge
 um
 loss


that
 we
 incur
 when
 we
 um


build
 our
 lives
 uh
 for
 some
 of
 these


other
 values
 and
 I
 have
 found
 that
 um
 in


my
 experience
 and
 and
 in
 other
 people


that
 I've
 interviewed
 if
 they
 situate


their
 lives
 so
 that
 they
 it's
 built


around
 friends
 physically
 close
 by
 their


to
 their
 friends
 it
 makes
 it
 so
 much


easier
 to
 maintain
 those
 friendships.


And
 that
 is
 especially
 true
 for
 people


who
 are
 really
 timestrapped
 um
 and
 like


bound
 to
 the
 home
 like
 if
 they
 have


young
 children
 or
 if
 they
 have
 to


caretake
 for
 you
 know
 a
 relative
 in


their
 life
 that
 having
 somebody
 next


door
 um
 or
 down
 the
 block
 or
 you
 know


just
 very
 close
 by
 it
 can
 um
 make
 or


break
 the
 ability
 to
 get
 close
 to
 other


people.
 So
 um
 I
 know
 that
 that
 can
 take


some
 work
 and
 we
 can
 talk
 about
 that.


Um,
 but
 that's
 the
 more
 radical


suggestion
 that
 I
 think
 you're
 doing


work
 on
 the
 front
 end
 that
 makes


friendship
 easier
 in
 the
 longer
 run.


>> Well,
 you
 know
 what
 you've
 shared
 is
 a


lot
 around
 people
 that
 maybe
 are
 already


in
 your
 life
 in
 some
 capacity
 and
 you


see
 some
 opportunity
 to
 deepen
 the


relationship.
 How
 what
 are
 some
 tips
 you


would
 suggest
 for
 people
 who
 are


interested
 in
 in
 meeting
 people
 with
 the


hopes
 that
 it
 could
 turn
 into
 something


more?
 How
 do
 you
 approach
 those
 sorts
 of


relationships?


Yeah,
 I
 I
 mean
 there
 are
 kind
 of
 a
 few


steps
 there.
 So,
 one
 is
 like
 the
 search


process.
 How
 do
 you
 find
 people
 who
 you


might
 potentially
 want
 to
 become
 friends


with?
 And
 then
 there's
 okay,
 you
 found


somebody
 who
 you
 want
 to
 be
 friends
 with


or
 a
 group
 of
 people.
 How
 do
 you
 make


them
 how
 do
 you
 like
 end
 up
 becoming


friends?
 And
 then
 it's
 once
 you
 become


casual
 friends,
 how
 do
 you
 become
 really


close?
 Um
 I
 I
 recently
 uh
 went
 to
 a


party
 that
 I
 felt
 like
 was
 a
 very


interesting
 uh
 example
 of
 a
 of
 a
 way
 to


solve
 that
 first
 search
 problem.
 So


there
 were
 a
 few
 of
 my
 friends
 who
 were


um
 had
 kind
 of
 realized
 that
 they
 wanted


to
 widen
 their
 social
 circle
 because


they
 would
 go
 to
 a
 party
 and
 like
 all


their
 friends
 were
 friends
 with
 each


other.
 So
 they
 were
 like
 locked
 in
 this


circle
 together.
 And
 they
 held
 a
 party


that
 they
 called
 three
 degrees
 like
 the


six
 degrees
 of
 or
 whatever.
 six
 six


degrees
 of
 separation
 with
 the
 Kevin


Bacon
 thing.
 And
 um
 the
 the
 uh
 rules


were
 if
 you
 were
 invited,
 you
 were
 asked


to
 bring
 one
 friend
 that
 the
 hosts


didn't
 know.
 So
 that
 was
 the
 second


degree.
 And
 then
 that
 person
 was
 also


supposed
 to
 bring
 a
 friend
 that
 the


first
 guest
 didn't
 know.
 So
 that's
 the


third
 degree.
 And
 it
 meant
 that


twothirds
 of
 the
 party
 were
 people
 that


the
 host
 didn't
 know.
 And
 also
 because


everyone
 was
 kind
 of
 at
 a
 there
 were
 a


lot of
 people
 at
 a
 remove
 um
 it
 made
 it


uh
 more
 likely
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 meet


new
 people.
 Uh
 so
 that's
 a
 way
 I
 thought


was
 really
 interesting
 for
 um
 how
 you


can
 encounter
 new
 people.
 Um
 or
 you


could
 do
 a
 version
 of
 that
 I
 think at
 a


dinner
 party
 with
 eight
 people
 in


addition
 to
 like
 all
 the
 all
 the
 sort
 of


standard
 things
 that
 people
 will
 um


advise
 because
 they
 make
 sense
 like
 uh


going
 to
 do
 some
 sort
 of
 activity
 that


that
 is
 oriented
 around
 community.
 Like


for
 me
 that's
 swing
 dance.
 Um
 it
 could


be
 a
 religious
 community,
 something


where
 there
 is
 a
 place
 where
 people
 are


going
 to
 be
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 keep


seeing
 them
 and
 inevitably
 you'll
 strike


up
 conversation
 because
 you
 keep
 seeing


them.
 So
 that's
 kind
 of
 one
 way
 to
 deal


with
 the
 search
 issue.
 And
 then
 in
 terms


of
 how
 do
 you
 make
 friends
 from
 people


that
 you
 find?
 Uh
 I
 I
 would
 recommend


trying
 to
 make
 the
 first
 move.
 Uh
 and


this
 can
 be
 difficult
 in
 friendship


because
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 have
 the


expectation
 of
 rejection
 in
 the
 way
 that


it's
 really
 built
 into
 by
 contrast


romantic
 relationships
 that
 we


understand
 that
 there's
 some
 amount
 of


risk-taking
 putting
 yourself
 out
 there


and
 romantic
 relationships.
 But
 the
 same


goes
 for
 platonic
 relationships
 and
 it


sucks
 to
 make
 a
 bid
 and
 have
 it
 rejected


um
 you
 know
 to
 invite
 someone
 to
 dinner


or
 coffee
 or
 an
 activity.
 But
 um
 I
 think


uh
 trying
 to
 embolden
 yourself
 to
 make


the
 first
 move
 uh
 because
 otherwise


there
 will
 be
 people
 who
 all
 maybe
 want


to
 get
 to
 know
 each
 other
 but


everybody's
 a
 little
 bit
 afraid.
 Um
 and


then
 the
 third
 thing
 is
 like
 how
 do
 you


escalate
 the
 friendship?
 And
 I
 think


that
 doing
 the
 kind
 of
 recurring


hangouts
 that
 I
 suggested
 is
 is
 one
 way.


Um
 I've
 sometimes
 been
 really
 explicit


with
 people
 and
 told
 them
 I
 have
 a


friend
 crush
 on
 them
 or
 that
 you
 know
 um


earlier
 when
 I
 moved
 to
 DC
 where
 where
 I


live
 I
 had
 decide
 I
 like
 told
 a
 friend


I'm
 you
 know
 deciding
 to
 focus
 on
 like


making
 a
 few
 really
 close
 friends
 as


opposed
 to
 a
 wider
 circle
 and
 that
 she


was
 one
 of
 those
 people
 and
 that
 ended


up
 I
 think
 pretty
 much
 transforming
 our


friendship.
 um
 we
 don't
 live
 in
 the
 same


place,
 but
 uh
 I
 you
 know
 officiated
 her


wedding
 this
 this
 past
 year.
 And
 I
 think


that
 really
 articulating
 that
 I
 had
 that


um
 I
 so
 thought
 so
 highly
 of
 her
 and
 I


really
 wanted
 to
 get
 to
 know
 her
 um
 made


it
 easier
 for
 us
 to
 get
 closer
 faster


and
 like
 spend
 more
 time
 together
 than


we
 might
 have
 otherwise.
 Mhm.
 It
 it
 it


strikes
 me
 how
 much
 of
 a
 role
 like
 just


saying
 the
 thing
 really
 helps
 here
 in
 in


a
 way
 that
 maybe
 we
 we
 do
 this
 in


romantic
 relationships
 and
 not
 in


others.
 Like
 I
 if
 someone
 were
 to
 say


something
 like
 that
 to
 me,
 it
 would


become
 immediately
 obvious
 how
 strongly


you
 feel
 about
 that
 relationship
 and


that
 feels
 like
 such
 a
 simple
 but


profound
 way
 to
 to
 think
 about
 this.
 Um


well
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 questions
 from


members
 about
 the
 important
 role
 of


physically
 being
 in
 in
 in
 front
 of
 a


person
 plays
 here.
 So
 Valerie
 C
 for


instance
 asks
 um
 if
 you
 could
 tell
 us


more
 about
 the
 research
 around
 how


important
 authentic
 connection
 is
 um


when
 you're
 an
 in-person
 having
 it
 be
 an


in-person
 experience
 versus
 something


that's
 virtual.


>> Um
 I
 you
 know
 I
 didn't
 end
 up
 focusing


that
 much
 on
 the
 kind
 of
 virtual
 uh


connection
 piece.
 So
 I
 don't
 um
 I
 don't


have
 like
 specific
 people
 to
 site
 other


than
 what
 I
 was
 mentioning
 before
 around


you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 key
 um
 key


ingredients
 of
 and
 a
 a
 very
 close


relationship
 and
 attachment
 relationship


does
 involve
 physical
 touch.
 Um
 and


obviously
 there's
 going to
 be
 variation


across
 people.
 Um
 so
 I
 but
 you
 know
 I


would
 say
 like
 there
 are
 ways
 that
 you


can
 connect
 with
 people
 virtually
 as
 as


we
 are
 doing
 now.
 But
 there
 are
 things


that
 you
 don't
 pick
 up
 when
 uh
 you
 are


texting
 with
 someone.
 Um
 as
 an
 example,


I
 uh
 had
 a
 friend
 who
 um
 I
 I
 live
 with


who
 um
 was
 going
 through
 something
 very


difficult
 and
 some
 and
 someone
 in
 the


house
 asked
 how
 she
 was
 doing
 and
 she


could
 not
 fake
 it.
 she
 couldn't,
 you


know,
 she
 couldn't
 decide
 to,
 if
 someone


had
 asked
 her
 that
 by
 text,
 she
 might


have
 not
 answered
 immediately
 or,
 you


know,
 brushed
 it
 off.
 But
 when
 you
 are


in
 person
 with
 with
 people,
 there's
 body


language,
 there
 are
 there
 expressions
 um


that
 I
 think
 especially
 if
 there's


something
 that's
 kind
 of
 more
 difficult


going
 on
 uh
 that
 you
 pick
 up
 on
 as
 well


as
 just
 getting
 to
 know
 people
 better.


uh
 you
 you
 know
 like
 I
 think
 of
 um
 a


friend
 of
 mine
 who
 will
 just
 like
 she


can
 get
 get
 jittery
 and
 like
 shake
 her


leg
 a
 lot
 and
 that
 is
 a
 signal
 to
 me


that
 she's
 feeling
 particularly
 anxious


and
 um
 by
 observe
 like
 observing
 that


helped
 me
 understand
 other
 things
 about


her.
 So,
 um,
 while
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 it's


really
 great
 to
 be
 able
 to
 connect
 with,


um,
 people
 all
 around
 the
 world
 through


different
 kinds
 of,
 um,
 online


platforms,
 um,
 and
 and
 text
 and
 and


voice
 chat,
 um,
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 that


they
 are,
 uh,
 a
 total
 replacement
 for


the,
 uh,
 the
 things
 that
 you
 learn
 about


people
 and
 the
 ways
 you're
 able
 to
 care


for
 them,
 like
 giving
 a
 hug
 or
 being


really
 what
 it
 means
 to
 be
 physically


present.
 um
 that
 it's
 uh
 you
 you
 need
 at


least
 some
 inerson
 uh
 interaction
 I


think
 at
 some
 point
 to
 to
 get
 really


close.


>> And
 I'd
 love
 to
 dive
 into
 this
 a
 little


bit
 more
 later
 later
 in
 the
 conversation


just
 sort
 of
 thinking
 about
 the
 the


future
 and
 sort
 of
 where
 we're
 headed


but
 um
 sort
 of
 sticking
 in
 this
 space
 of


how
 to
 to
 cultivate
 these
 relationships.


um
 thinking
 about
 support
 for
 this,
 how


what
 can
 loved
 ones
 or
 family
 members
 do


um
 to
 support
 people
 who
 have
 decided
 to


deepen
 a
 platonic
 relationship?


>> I
 think
 one
 thing
 is
 to
 come
 in
 from
 a


place
 of
 curiosity
 rather
 than
 judgment.


One
 thing
 that
 I
 saw
 people
 who
 had


platonic
 partnerships
 really
 struggle


with
 was
 the
 constant
 misunderstanding


that
 they
 were
 up
 against
 and
 often
 not


just
 sort
 of
 benign
 misunderstanding
 um


but
 people
 who
 kind
 of
 stigma
 like


treated
 their
 friendship
 in
 a
 way
 that


was
 stigmatized.
 Um,
 and
 that
 could


include
 gossiping.
 Um,
 or,
 you
 know,
 I


write
 about
 a
 mother
 who
 is
 just
 like,
 I


I
 don't
 understand
 how
 you
 can
 be
 so


close
 to
 somebody
 who
 you're
 not


romantically
 involved
 in
 and
 was


convinced
 that
 the
 the
 friendship


between
 two
 her
 son
 and
 her
 son's
 best


friend
 was
 a
 romantic
 relationship.
 I


mean,
 that's
 pretty
 common.
 Um,
 so
 I


think
 coming
 in
 from
 not
 a
 place
 of
 like


here's
 how
 I
 expect
 you
 to
 live
 your


life.
 Why
 aren't
 you
 living
 your
 life


that
 way?
 um
 the
 only
 way
 I
 can


understand
 this
 friendship
 is
 if
 it
 is


romantic.
 Um
 or
 or
 telling
 them
 like


your
 priorities
 are
 messed
 up,
 which
 is


also
 something
 I've
 heard.
 Um
 yeah,


those
 are
 those
 are
 not
 very
 helpful.


And
 instead
 being
 like
 who
 matters
 to


you?
 Why
 does
 this
 person
 matter
 to
 you?


like
 coming
 from
 a
 place
 of
 these


open-ended
 questions
 and
 trying
 to
 get


to
 know
 the
 person.
 Um,
 treating
 them
 as


you
 would
 treat
 someone's
 new
 romantic


partner
 or
 um,
 somebody
 that
 they
 or


maybe
 a
 relative
 that
 um,
 it's
 somebody


who
 will
 uh,
 who
 really
 matters
 to
 a


person
 you
 care
 about
 and
 therefore
 by


extension
 you
 want
 to
 care
 about
 them


too.
 Um,
 so
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 that's


one
 way
 um,
 loved
 ones
 can
 be


supportive.
 H
 and
 what
 about
 the
 the


structures
 around
 us?
 You
 you
 talk
 about


this
 um
 in
 in
 the
 talk
 and
 a
 fair
 amount


in
 the
 book.
 This
 idea
 of
 of
 of
 friends


um
 being
 supported
 in
 the
 workplace
 or


um
 in
 their
 communities
 and
 government.


Uh
 what
 sort
 of
 things
 do
 we
 need
 um
 to


make
 room
 for
 more
 expansive
 and


meaningful
 platonic
 bonds
 um
 outside
 of


of
 um
 of
 these
 relationships
 in
 our
 in


our
 wider
 communities?
 Mhm.
 I
 mean,
 I


think
 the
 kind
 of
 underlying
 principle


of
 not
 coming
 from
 a
 rigid
 place
 of
 this


is
 there's
 one
 or
 two
 kinds
 of


relationships
 that
 matter,
 you
 know,


romantic
 and
 familial
 and
 everything


else
 is
 less
 less
 important.
 Um,
 I
 think


that
 that
 translates
 to
 workplaces
 and


to
 policy.
 So
 uh
 you
 know
 one
 way
 this


this
 tends
 to
 come
 up
 is
 when
 somebody


uh
 when
 a
 friend
 is
 ill
 um
 or
 has
 passed


away
 and
 the
 question
 is
 what
 will
 the


workplace
 do
 to
 support
 them
 or
 not
 and


also
 what
 does
 policy
 allow?
 So
 there


was
 a
 a
 woman
 who
 uh
 I
 I
 mentioned


earlier
 who
 took
 care
 of
 her
 best
 friend


who
 was
 who
 was
 dying
 of
 cancer,
 was
 the


main
 caregiver,
 and
 her
 workplace
 did


not
 entitle
 her
 to
 family
 medical
 leave.


Um
 um
 nor
 when
 her
 friend
 died
 was
 she


entitled
 to
 bereavement
 leave
 because


those
 were
 uh
 benefits
 that
 were


restricted
 to
 if
 it
 was
 a
 family
 member


or
 a
 friend.
 Um,
 interestingly,
 if
 this


had
 happened
 now,
 the
 state
 she
 lives


in,
 Minnesota
 would,
 um,
 has
 expanded


the
 definition
 of
 kind
 of
 who,
 uh,


counts
 as
 somebody
 that
 you
 can
 take


this
 kind
 of
 leave
 for.
 So,
 it's
 anybody


that
 you,
 you
 know,
 you're
 close
 enough


to
 consider
 family,
 which
 can
 be
 a


platonic
 relationship.
 Um
 so
 that's


something
 that
 both
 I
 think
 workplaces


and
 policy
 um
 can
 can
 do
 to
 uh
 be
 more


expansive
 about
 how
 uh
 about
 providing


benefits
 and
 rights
 to
 people
 who
 uh
 are


outside
 of
 these
 the
 boxes
 of
 um
 kind
 of


blood
 or
 adopted
 family
 um
 or
 uh


marriage.
 And
 then
 the
 one
 other
 um
 kind


of
 significant
 policy
 area
 that
 I


explore
 uh
 has
 to
 do
 with
 the
 fact
 that


we
 really
 only
 have
 marriage
 uh
 as
 a
 a


source
 of
 of
 um
 rights
 and
 and
 benefits


in
 this
 country.
 uh
 whereas
 in
 other


other
 countries
 and
 also
 in
 other
 times


in
 the
 US
 there
 have
 been
 um
 things
 like


domestic
 partnerships


um
 that
 would
 allow
 people
 who
 are
 not


romantically
 involved
 to
 be
 able
 to
 sign


rights
 to
 another
 person.
 Um
 and
 instead


what
 ends
 up
 happening
 is
 that
 if
 you


want
 to
 have
 your
 friend
 be
 your
 you


know
 the
 heir
 to
 um
 uh
 the
 you
 know
 that


the
 goods
 you
 have
 in
 your
 life
 or
 you


want
 them
 to
 have
 medical
 or
 legal
 power


of
 attorney
 rights.
 I
 mean,
 those
 are


things
 that
 you
 have
 to
 do
 um
 by
 going


to
 a
 lawyer,
 getting
 which
 can
 be


expensive
 and
 going
 through
 a
 lot
 of


paperwork
 um
 that
 u
 may
 or
 may
 not
 be


recognized
 in
 the
 heat
 of
 the
 moment


like
 in
 a
 hospital
 um
 because
 it's
 it's


not
 something
 that
 uh
 people
 are
 used


to.
 They
 they're
 used
 to
 this
 status


that's
 associated
 with
 marriage
 or


associated
 with
 being
 um
 a
 family
 member


but
 not
 to
 uh
 the
 idea
 that
 a
 friend
 can


be
 significant.
 So
 uh
 one
 thing
 that
 I


saw
 from
 different
 legal
 scholars
 was


the
 proposal
 to
 offer
 legal
 alternatives


to
 marriage
 like
 that
 there
 you
 know


when
 you
 go
 to
 the
 DMV
 you
 designate
 a


person
 um
 who
 is
 the
 default
 person
 to


handle
 medical
 and
 legal
 things
 in
 your


life
 and
 that
 um
 and
 that
 would
 be


especially
 helpful
 for
 people
 who
 aren't


married
 but
 um
 you
 can
 also
 uh
 you
 know


in
 other
 cases
 you
 would
 be
 able
 to


assign
 rights
 to
 different
 people
 which


again
 is
 something
 that
 you
 can
 do
 if


you
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 and
 have
 the


wherewithal


to
 go
 through
 a
 lawyer
 for
 for
 different


sorts
 of
 contracts,
 but
 that's
 not


accessible
 to
 most
 people.
 It
 doesn't,


you
 know,
 it's
 not
 like
 20
 or
 $30
 in
 the


way
 that
 a
 marriage
 license
 is.
 Um,
 so
 I


it
 so
 having
 um
 a
 way
 that
 the
 state


could
 uh
 recognize
 relationships
 that


are
 not
 romantic
 or
 familial
 in
 nature


would
 be
 a
 really
 big
 step.


>> Well,
 we
 have
 a
 question
 from
 Carlos
 O.


uh
 which
 it's
 really
 interesting


connected
 to
 this
 like
 so
 if
 we
 look
 at


the
 opposite
 end
 of
 this
 do
 you
 think


that
 there's
 a
 a
 business
 case
 for


organizations
 to
 to
 do
 this
 to
 sort
 of


pro
 to
 support
 uh
 these
 sorts
 of


relationships
 and
 connections


>> um
 yeah
 it's
 interesting
 I
 I
 mean
 I


think
 that
 people
 are
 more
 content
 when


uh
 they
 have
 a
 life
 that
 sort
 of


holistically
 feels
 full.
 I
 know
 that


there's
 research
 also,
 I
 mean,
 if
 you're


thinking
 specifically
 about
 friendships


in
 the
 workplace
 that
 that
 can
 um
 be


really
 uh
 sort
 of
 have
 have
 effects
 on


retention
 um
 if
 people
 feel
 close
 close


to
 others
 at
 work.
 But
 if
 it's,
 you


know,
 if
 you're
 talking
 about
 close


friendships
 outside
 of
 work,
 um,
 and


let's
 say
 it's
 an
 occasion
 like
 someone


is
 sick
 in
 their
 lives,
 um,
 I
 think


people
 will
 feel,
 uh,
 a
 sense
 of,
 um,


gratitude
 to
 the
 or,
 you
 know,


organization
 that
 they
 are
 being
 seen
 as


a
 whole
 person
 who,
 um,
 isn't
 just
 there


to
 be
 a
 kind
 of
 cog
 um,
 in
 the
 machine


and,
 um,
 where
 there
 are
 very
 narrow


exceptions
 for
 when
 they're
 they're
 not


allowed
 to
 work.
 Um
 I
 I
 think
 people


like
 respond
 to
 that
 really
 well
 and
 it


it
 feels
 in
 line
 with
 um
 you
 know


different
 kinds
 of
 like
 affinity
 groups


within
 organizations
 or
 the
 way
 that


people
 um
 can
 be
 uh
 really
 committed
 to


a
 workplace
 that
 gives
 them
 um
 high


quality
 family
 benefits
 uh
 because
 they


think
 that
 that
 will
 better,
 you
 know,


allow
 them
 to
 experience
 the
 entirety
 of


their
 their
 lives
 and
 um
 not
 feel
 like


they're
 compromising
 um
 you
 know,


getting
 promoted
 at
 work
 and
 that
 kind


of
 thing.
 So,
 I
 I
 can
 imagine
 that
 that


businesses
 would
 would
 benefit
 um
 and


have
 happier
 and
 more
 devoted
 employees


um
 when
 these
 sorts
 of
 relationships
 are


are
 recognized


>> and
 I
 imagine
 that
 probably
 trickles
 out


beyond
 organizations
 into
 the
 way


communities
 sort
 of
 t
 tackle
 this
 and


think
 about
 this
 too.
 Um
 well,
 one
 thing


that
 really
 struck
 me
 in
 reading
 your


book
 is
 is
 really
 the
 diversity
 of


people
 who
 have
 you
 you've
 encountered


who
 have
 chosen
 to
 sort
 of
 pursue
 these


types
 of
 relationships.
 It
 seems
 to


really
 transcend
 everything
 from
 race,


gender,
 age,
 sexuality,
 all
 types
 of
 of


of
 of
 identifying
 factors.
 Although
 you


do
 see
 that
 the
 different
 identifying


factors
 people
 have
 impact
 the
 way
 that


those
 involved
 navigate
 uh
 these
 sorts


of
 relationships.
 So,
 I'm
 curious
 to


know
 as
 we
 sort
 of
 look
 to
 the
 future,


how
 you
 you
 see
 um
 some
 of
 this
 changing


as
 the
 demographic
 makeup
 of
 our
 of
 our


world
 continues
 to
 evolve.


>> Yeah,
 it
 was
 really
 important.
 I
 mean,


thank
 you
 for
 saying
 that.
 It
 was
 really


important
 to
 me
 to
 show
 that
 uh
 the


variety
 of
 people
 who
 have
 these
 sorts


of
 friendships.
 It
 is
 not
 um
 just
 some
 I


don't
 like
 I
 think
 young
 people
 um
 often


uh
 believe
 that
 they're
 they've
 invented


everything.
 And
 in
 fact,
 I
 think the


most
 powerful
 stories
 were
 people
 in


their,
 you
 know,
 60s,7s,
 80s
 who
 have


who
 have
 really
 uh
 shown
 what
 it
 looks


like
 to
 have
 um
 a
 real
 committed


long-term
 friendship.
 Uh
 but
 you
 know,


as
 we
 move
 forward,
 some
 there
 are


demographic
 trends
 that
 I
 think
 point
 to


people
 finding
 um
 or
 or
 having
 the
 need


to
 look
 more
 broadly
 for
 the
 kind
 of


support
 and
 connection
 that
 they
 get.
 Um


many
 of
 the
 people
 that
 I
 wrote
 about
 um


something,
 you
 know,
 something
 didn't


quite
 work
 out
 in
 their
 lives
 that
 they


as
 they'd
 expected.
 They
 didn't
 they


maybe
 didn't
 find
 a
 partner.
 Um
 or


there's
 one
 person
 I
 wrote
 about
 who
 is


um
 on
 the
 asexual
 spectrum
 and
 realized


that
 uh
 sort
 of
 I
 don't
 know
 a
 standard


or
 like
 conventional
 relationship
 was


not
 going
 to
 be
 the
 kind
 of
 thing
 that


they
 would
 pursue.
 And
 I
 think
 as
 we
 see


um
 the
 rates
 of
 marriage
 declining
 and


people
 getting
 married
 later
 um
 that


that
 is
 can
 be
 a
 form
 of
 encouragement


to
 be
 more
 creative
 with
 um
 finding
 a


life
 that
 you
 uh
 feel
 fulfilled
 by.
 Uh
 I


think
 there's
 also
 increasing


recognition
 that
 the
 ways
 that
 we
 have


uh
 set
 expectations
 for
 a
 a
 healthy


relationship
 are
 um
 actually
 undermining


um
 those
 relationships
 and
 that
 it


really
 helps
 to
 have
 um
 a
 wider
 set
 of


people.
 I
 mean
 Esther
 Pel,
 the


psychologist
 has
 famously
 said
 that
 we


uh
 now
 expect
 of
 one
 person
 what
 we
 used


to
 expect
 of
 a
 whole
 village.
 So
 I
 think


there
 are
 some
 kind
 of
 cultural
 forces


that
 might
 that
 might
 increasingly


encourage
 people
 to
 look
 to
 the


significance
 of
 their
 friendships
 and


broadening
 um
 the
 kinds
 of
 people
 that


they
 um
 want
 to
 have
 in
 their
 lives.
 And


I
 think
 I've
 just
 seen
 such
 a
 blow
 up
 in


interest
 um
 in
 chosen
 families
 um
 and


also
 um
 particularly
 for
 caregivers


having
 this
 idea
 of
 a
 village
 uh
 that


they
 are
 they
 don't
 have
 to
 go
 it
 alone


that
 um
 parenting
 has
 been
 so
 difficult


for
 so
 many
 people
 and
 isolating
 and
 um


there's
 just
 a
 lot
 more
 interest
 um
 that


I
 I
 have
 seen
 and
 I
 can
 point
 to
 sort
 of


like
 organizations
 that
 of
 uh
 that
 are


doing
 work
 on
 this
 in
 response
 to
 that


um
 that
 growing
 interest
 in
 um
 looking


to
 to
 friends
 and
 re
 being
 creative


about
 what
 it
 what
 it
 looks
 like
 to
 to


kind
 of
 like
 rebuild
 something
 that
 had


existed
 more
 commonly
 in
 the
 past
 and


exists
 in
 some
 kind
 of
 um
 some
 cultures


um
 as
 all
 over
 the
 the
 place
 to
 not
 just


have
 a
 small
 nuclear
 family
 but
 maybe
 to


have
 multigenerational
 homes
 or
 extended


households
 where
 you
 have
 aunties
 and


uncles
 who
 may
 or
 may
 not
 be
 related
 to


uh
 to
 you,
 but
 really
 feel
 like
 those


those
 deep
 um
 connections.


>> Well,
 you
 mentioned
 um
 tech
 earlier
 and


how
 that
 wasn't
 really
 a
 big
 part
 of
 how


you
 approached
 this,
 but
 as
 we're


thinking
 to
 the
 future,
 I'm
 interested


to
 hear
 your
 perspective
 on
 how
 you


think
 tech
 will
 impact
 the
 the
 nature
 of


I
 guess
 all
 relationships,
 but
 these


sort
 of
 platonic
 partnerships
 as
 you
 as


you
 say.
 Um,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 say
 that


they
 that
 tech
 might
 lead
 us
 to
 retreat


from
 each
 other
 more
 and
 spend
 more
 time


away
 from
 other
 humans
 interacting
 less


with
 one
 another.
 How
 do
 you
 see
 this


playing
 a
 role
 in
 the
 future
 of
 these


relationships?


>> I
 mean,
 my
 best
 guess
 is
 that
 it
 will
 be


a
 mixed
 bag
 as
 it
 currently
 is
 a
 mixed


bag.
 So,
 I
 feel
 really
 grateful
 that
 I


have
 a
 way
 um
 to
 be
 in
 touch
 with


friends
 from
 all
 over
 the
 place.
 I
 mean,


just
 the
 other
 day,
 I
 had
 a
 friend
 um


text
 me
 uh
 you
 know,
 a
 photo
 from
 a


place
 she
 say
 staying
 and
 that
 she
 was


thinking
 of
 me.
 She
 lives
 on
 the
 other


side
 of
 the
 country
 and
 we
 only
 get
 to


see
 each
 other
 a
 few
 times
 a
 year
 in


person.
 Um
 uh
 or
 you
 know,
 I
 left
 a


voice
 memo
 on
 a
 walk
 yesterday
 for
 a


friend
 of
 mine
 who
 lives
 in
 another


city.
 Um,
 so
 I
 I
 think
 those
 ways
 of
 of


being
 able
 to
 reach
 out
 um
 or
 coordinate


so
 that
 you
 can
 go
 on
 a
 trip
 together
 or


you
 know
 whatot
 um
 those
 are
 great
 part


like
 ways
 that
 technology
 can
 um
 can


enable
 or
 help
 us
 maintain
 friendships.


I
 think
 the
 risk
 comes
 when
 technology


becomes
 a
 replacement
 for
 the
 kinds
 of


um
 interactions
 that
 you
 would
 might


otherwise
 have
 with
 friends.
 um
 when


you're
 you
 know
 watching
 YouTube
 video


after
 YouTube
 video
 or
 you
 develop
 a


parasocial
 relationship
 with
 someone


that
 you
 haven't
 met
 and
 it
 feels
 um
 you


know
 it
 it
 might
 feel
 like
 you
 uh
 you


are
 being
 known
 by
 whatever
 the
 uh
 I


work
 in
 podcasting
 but
 you
 know
 I
 think


this
 can
 happen
 with
 podcast
 hosts
 or


with
 television
 with
 celebrities
 um
 but


it's
 but
 it's
 fundamentally
 one-sided
 so


um
 I
 think
 tech
 can
 give
 us
 the
 illusion


of
 having
 relationships
 when
 we
 owned


and
 then
 the
 I
 think
 that
 with
 this


newer
 technologies
 um
 that
 around
 um
 AI


tools
 that
 uh
 are
 are
 really
 you
 know


skillful
 at
 mimicking
 certain
 aspects
 of


um
 human
 uh
 relationships.
 Um
 I
 think


one
 of
 the
 concerns
 there
 is
 that
 having


relation
 is
 again
 about
 this


one-sidedness.
 um
 that
 having


relationships
 with
 real
 humans
 or
 even


like
 pets
 um
 like
 any
 kind
 of
 living


being
 is
 uh
 comes
 with
 like
 some


difficulties
 and
 I'm
 recalling
 a
 story


that
 um
 a
 journalist
 I
 um
 I
 know
 told


where
 she
 was
 visiting
 some
 people
 uh


who
 are
 working
 on
 these
 robots
 that


will
 they
 think
 will
 kind
 of
 um
 become


friends
 for
 young
 you
 know
 for
 kids
 uh


and
 it's
 supposed
 to
 be
 a
 replacement


for
 iPad
 interaction


And
 uh
 this
 journalist
 was
 you
 know
 a


little
 bit
 unnerved
 by
 this
 and
 she
 was


kind
 of
 cracking
 a
 joke
 about
 like
 oh


have
 you
 guys
 thought
 about
 um
 you
 know


getting
 an
 AI
 girlfriend
 because
 she


wouldn't
 have
 any
 needs.
 Um
 and
 this
 was


they
 they'd
 also
 come
 up
 with
 like
 an
 AI


dog
 that
 like
 the
 the
 advantage
 that


they
 said
 was
 you
 know
 you
 don't
 have
 to


clean
 their
 pee
 or
 poop
 or
 train
 them
 or


whatever.
 No
 needs.
 And
 these
 um
 the


people
 at
 the
 startup
 were
 like
 didn't


take
 it
 as
 a
 joke.
 they
 were
 like,
 "Oh,


that's
 that's
 like
 an
 interesting
 idea."


Um,
 so
 I
 think
 the
 if
 the
 if
 people


become
 used
 to
 interactions
 where
 there


is
 nothing
 that
 they
 have
 to
 give
 up
 um


and
 they're
 getting
 what
 they
 want
 when


they
 want
 it
 all
 the
 time,
 that
 that
 um


not
 only
 becomes
 a
 problem
 because
 it
 it


it
 displaces
 time
 you
 would
 spend
 with


other
 people
 um
 but
 also
 because
 it


becomes
 this
 comparison
 point
 that
 is


impossible
 for
 any
 person
 to
 meet.
 um


because
 a
 relationship
 is
 two-sided
 and


it's
 just
 not
 always
 going
 to
 um
 be


simple
 or
 easy
 all
 the
 time.
 So
 that


that's
 um
 maybe
 my
 my
 biggest
 concern


around
 the
 um
 the
 future
 of
 technology


and
 how
 it
 might
 shape
 our
 our
 thinking


about
 friendships


>> and
 and
 so
 much
 that
 you've
 shared
 here


in
 terms
 of
 tips
 for
 people
 developing


these
 these
 relationships
 has
 been


around
 being
 vulnerable
 and
 and
 really


putting
 yourself
 out
 there.
 And
 um
 Renee


A
 asked
 how
 you
 can
 attempt
 to
 connect


with
 people
 without
 seeming
 needy.
 So


what
 are
 I
 guess
 some
 of the
 ways
 you


you
 get
 over
 some
 of
 those
 feelings
 and


and
 in
 doing
 that


um


you
 know
 I
 think
 I
 still
 have
 I
 will


hear
 myself
 apologize
 for
 things
 and


then
 have
 to
 backtrack
 on
 the
 apology.


Um
 I
 think
 also
 like
 giving
 to
 people
 is


one.
 Uh
 so
 that
 that
 might
 not
 feel


vulnerable
 in
 the
 um
 in
 the
 same
 way
 as


you
 know
 sharing
 that
 something


difficult
 is
 going
 on
 in
 your
 life.
 But


I'm
 thinking
 about
 a
 a
 friend
 who
 uh


hosted
 a
 a
 small
 group
 of
 us
 at
 her


house.
 I
 think
 letting
 people
 into
 your


home
 um
 is
 a
 very
 uh
 kind
 of
 intimate


revealing
 thing
 period.
 and
 she
 just
 fed


us
 all
 and
 had
 like
 multiple
 courses
 and


she,
 you
 know,
 her
 um
 expression
 of
 of


love
 and
 care
 is
 food.
 Um
 and
 and
 also


like
 had,
 you
 know,
 my
 housewarming
 had


brought
 these
 like
 incredible


Royos
 tea
 shortbread
 cookies.
 So,
 um
 I


what
 there's
 there
 are
 ways
 that
 I
 think


giving
 to
 other
 people
 and
 giving
 in
 a


way
 that
 shows
 that
 you
 are
 um
 maybe


thinking
 about
 what
 in
 particular
 they


might
 enjoy.
 Um
 and
 giving
 them
 a
 little


bit
 of
 exposure
 to
 to
 your
 life,
 even
 if


that's
 just
 like
 what's
 the
 art
 on
 your


walls,
 what
 are
 the
 books
 on
 your
 shelf?


Um
 that
 can
 be
 um
 a
 more
 um
 a
 smaller


form
 of
 vulnerability.
 And
 I
 also
 think


um
 it's
 useful
 to
 understand
 for


yourself
 like
 what
 are
 the
 conditions


that
 make
 it
 easier
 to
 um
 to
 be


vulnerable.
 I
 think
 for
 me
 I'm
 probably


more
 likely
 to
 open
 up
 um
 in
 someone's


home
 than
 I
 am
 uh
 out
 in
 public.
 Uh
 so


you
 can
 have
 these
 uh
 um
 the
 setting
 can


be
 kind
 of
 a
 gateway
 to
 that
 kind
 of
 um


intimacy.
 Uh
 so
 yeah
 I
 but
 you
 know
 um


yeah
 but
 so
 those
 are
 ways
 to
 I
 think
 be


a
 little
 bit
 vulnerable
 without
 feeling


like
 you're
 you're
 immediately
 asking
 um


for
 help
 and
 that
 by
 giving
 support
 to


people
 you're
 also
 make
 giving
 um


permission
 um
 to
 maybe
 later
 ask
 for


help
 and
 also
 giving
 them
 permission
 to


ask
 for
 help
 as
 well.


Well,
 Rain,
 as
 we
 wind
 down
 this


conversation
 and
 I
 I
 sort
 of
 open
 by


talking
 about
 the
 time
 of
 year
 that


we're,
 you
 know,
 entering
 the
 holiday


season
 and
 uh,
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 a
 time


for
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 can
 magnify


connection
 and
 also
 loneliness.
 Um,
 so


what
 are
 some
 ways
 you
 think
 we
 all
 can


broaden
 our
 sense
 of
 family
 and
 the


relationships
 that
 sustain
 us
 as
 we
 go


into
 this
 period
 of
 the
 year?


>> Yeah,
 I
 totally
 understand
 that
 it
 is


um,
 it
 is
 a
 complicated
 and
 sometimes


like
 difficult
 time.
 Um
 I'll
 share
 you


know
 one
 thing
 that
 uh
 had
 occurred
 uh


that
 that
 I'm
 doing
 with
 my
 friends
 this


year.
 Um
 so
 my
 husband
 is
 Dutch
 and


there
 is
 a
 very
 um
 important
 holiday


called
 Cclass
 in
 the
 Netherlands
 and
 it


involves
 uh
 essentially
 like
 a
 secret


Santa
 and
 you
 write
 poems
 that
 go
 with


the
 gift
 and
 it's
 it's
 kind
 of
 um
 you


know
 supposed
 to
 be
 fun
 and
 we
 have
 want


he
 and
 I
 have
 wanted
 to
 do
 this
 for
 each


other.
 um
 we've
 been
 together
 for
 a
 long


time
 and
 have
 not
 um
 have
 not
 often
 done


it
 because
 with
 two
 people
 it's
 like
 not


that
 exciting.
 um
 we
 we
 now
 live
 with


six
 other
 people
 and
 um
 it
 occurred
 to


me
 that
 we
 could
 do
 what
 his
 family
 had


done
 when
 he
 was
 a
 kid
 and
 um
 and


celebrate
 this
 holiday
 that
 we're
 um


essentially
 taking
 what
 had
 been
 a


family
 tradition
 and
 and
 letting
 friends


uh
 be
 be
 part
 of
 that.
 Um,
 and
 I
 and
 I


think
 that
 this
 is
 probably
 relevant
 for


a
 number
 of
 things
 this
 time
 of
 year


where
 there
 is
 this
 sort
 of
 more
 the


marrier
 feeling
 in
 that
 it
 can
 be
 hard


if
 you're
 on
 your
 own
 um
 or
 maybe
 you


just
 have
 like
 one
 other
 person
 that
 you


don't
 want
 to
 have
 a
 full
 Thanksgiving


meal
 or
 you
 know
 um
 what
 like
 whatever


the
 the
 kind
 of
 holiday
 is.
 So
 my


suggestion
 would
 be
 is
 there
 some
 kind


of
 uh
 sort
 of
 tradition
 or
 thing
 that


feel
 would
 feel
 really
 nice
 to
 do
 this


time
 of
 year
 that
 you
 that
 um
 maybe
 you


have
 attached
 to
 family
 uh
 but
 could
 be


something
 that
 you
 invite
 other
 people


into.
 Uh
 I
 think
 the
 idea
 of
 I
 think


friends
 giving
 which
 has
 has
 become
 very


popular
 in
 the
 last
 several
 years
 in
 the


US
 uh
 is
 one
 version
 of
 that
 and
 it
 can


be
 um
 a
 really
 like
 lovely
 way
 for


people
 to
 experience
 Thanksgiving
 but


among
 people
 who
 are
 not
 necessarily


their
 blood
 relatives.
 So
 um
 yeah
 that


that's
 one
 one
 suggestion
 that
 I
 have
 um


for
 help
 having
 people
 be
 um
 to
 not
 feel


like
 they
 are
 stuck
 with
 whatever
 the


given
 family
 situation
 is
 and
 that
 they


can
 um
 make
 their
 own
 version
 of
 um
 what


they
 the
 things
 that
 they
 enjoy
 or
 might


enjoy
 about
 this
 time
 of
 year.


>> Um
 so
 many
 great
 ideas
 here
 and
 Raina
 I


feel
 like
 we
 could
 keep
 talking
 for
 for


ages.
 We've
 reached
 the
 end
 of
 our
 time


unfortunately
 and
 and
 thank
 you
 to
 the


the
 members
 who
 submitted
 questions
 that


we
 didn't
 we
 didn't
 get
 to.
 Um
 this
 has


been
 wonderful.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


the
 gift
 of
 your
 your
 time
 and
 and
 your


insight,
 Reena.


>> Oh
 well,
 thank
 you
 for
 your
 thoughtful


questions
 and
 to
 everybody
 who
 submitted


questions
 too.
 Um
 it's
 really
 uh
 it's


exciting
 to
 me
 that
 people
 care
 about


this
 topic
 so
 much
 and
 want
 to
 learn


more
 about
 it.
