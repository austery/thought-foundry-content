Microsoft historically has been the greatest software company. You know, you've gone through a transition in the past where you used to sell Windows licenses and disks of Windows or Microsoft, and now you sell subscriptions to 365. Software as a service, incredibly low incremental cost per user, but the SaaS companies have underperformed. massively in the markets because the cogs of AI is just so high and that just completely breaks how these business models work. How do you, as perhaps the greatest software company, transition to this new age where cogs matters a lot? Yeah, so I think that this is a great question because in some sense the business models themselves, I think the levers are going to remain. similar right people like subscriptions because they can budget for them they are essentially entitlements to some consumption rights that come encapsulated in a subscription in some sense it becomes a pricing decision so how much consumption is in you are entitled to is if you look at all the coding subscriptions, that's kind of what they are, right? And they kind of have the pro tier, the standard tier and what have you. I think that's how the pricing and the margin structures will get tiered. The interesting thing is at Microsoft, the good news for us is we kind of are in that business across all those meters. And in fact, that as a portfolio level, we pretty much have consumption subscriptions to all of the other consumer levers as well. And then I think, Time will tell which of these models make sense in what categories.
