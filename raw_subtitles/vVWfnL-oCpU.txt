Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.
 We


are
 live.
 It
 is
 Wednesday,
 December


10th.
 FOMC
 day.
 FOMC
 day.
 Today
 is
 the


day
 where
 we
 figure
 out
 if
 the
 Federal


Reserve
 in
 the
 United
 States
 of
 America


is
 going
 to
 be
 cutting
 rates
 or
 not.
 We


will
 be
 seeing
 at
 around
 2:00
 p.m.


Eastern.
 I
 will
 be
 live
 at
 2:20.
 So
 200


p.m.
 Eastern,
 we
 will
 find
 out
 if
 the


Fed
 is
 going
 to
 cut
 rates.
 The
 FOMC


meeting
 will
 be
 starting
 at
 2:30.
 Uh


again,
 all
 Eastern.
 And
 currently
 right


now,


[laughter]
 I
 promise
 I
 didn't
 do
 that
 on


purpose.
 I
 haven't
 said
 that
 in
 a
 minute


though.
 It's
 kind
 It
 hasn't
 been
 as
 like


uh
 free
 flowing
 off
 the
 tongue
 in
 a


while.
 But
 currently
 right
 now,
 I
 missed


saying
 it.
 I
 It's
 sometimes
 these


phrases
 kind
 of
 fade
 away,
 but
 we
 got
 to


bring
 it
 back.
 Currently
 right
 now,


89.6%
 chance.
 89.6%
 chance.
 We're
 likely


going
 to
 get
 the
 rate
 cut.
 I
 mean,
 there


is
 a
 10.4%
 4%
 chance
 that
 Powell
 doesn't


give
 it
 to
 us.
 But
 uh
 I
 think
 we're


going
 to
 get
 it.
 And
 now
 the
 question
 is


just
 is
 the
 market
 going
 to
 react


positively
 or
 negatively.
 And
 I
 don't


know,
 dude.
 I
 have
 a
 feeling
 that
 we're


going
 to
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of a
 rip.
 But


then
 again,
 I
 also
 have
 a
 feeling
 that's


like
 market's
 going
 to
 see
 the
 news.


Pal's
 going
 to
 be
 hawkish.
 Market's
 just


not
 going
 to
 be
 happy
 about
 it.
 Tom
 Lee


came
 out
 this
 morning
 and
 he
 said
 that


uh
 the
 a
 hawkish
 cut
 is
 already
 priced


in.
 So
 end
 of
 year
 rally
 to
 around
 7,300


is
 set
 in
 place
 regardless
 of
 a
 hawkish


sentiment
 around
 the
 cut
 today,
 which
 I


think
 he's
 I
 think
 he's
 right
 about


that.
 But
 then
 again,
 we're
 going
 to


have
 to
 really
 see
 how
 the
 market


interprets
 it
 today
 and
 we'll
 know
 in
 a


few
 hours
 what
 ends
 up
 happening.
 But


there
 is
 about
 a
 90%
 chance
 that
 we're


going
 to
 get
 that
 rate
 cut
 here
 today.


Um,
 so
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.
 We


got
 some
 Nvidia
 headlines.
 We
 got
 a
 big


pounder
 contract
 that
 came
 out
 last


night.
 That's
 important
 to
 discuss.
 We


have
 Trump
 with
 his
 economic
 speech
 in


Pennsylvania
 yesterday.
 Some
 uh
 moments


from
 that
 that
 I
 think
 are
 relatively


important
 to
 get
 into.
 SpaceX,
 big
 rumor


going
 around
 that
 Elon
 has
 not


officially
 denied
 yet
 of
 them
 going


public
 in
 2026
 at
 a
 $1.5
 trillion


valuation,
 which
 is
 why
 Rocket
 Lab
 was


pumping
 yesterday.
 Are
 they
 still


pumping
 in
 the
 pre-market?
 Rocket
 Lab


right
 here
 was
 at
 55
 yesterday
 after


hours.
 Rocket
 Lab
 54.
 I
 mean
 pretty


exciting
 if
 you
 could
 get
 something
 like


SpaceX
 going
 public
 because
 Rocket
 Lab


as
 they're
 going to
 be
 seen
 as
 sympathy


plays,
 Red
 Wire,
 etc.
 And
 so
 we'll
 talk


about
 that
 and
 what
 implications
 that


has
 on
 space
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going


from
 there.
 And
 then
 you
 got
 these
 China


updates
 with
 Nvidia.
 You
 know
 how


yesterday
 the
 headline
 was
 that
 you
 know


Nvidia
 is
 saying
 yes,
 we
 can
 sell
 it
 to


China
 because
 Trump
 is
 now
 giving
 us
 the


export
 controls
 and
 lifting
 those


restrictions
 at
 least
 for
 the
 H200.


China
 came
 out
 and
 said
 we
 don't
 want


your
 chips.
 this
 morning
 had
 a
 bunch
 of


Chinese
 tech
 companies
 say,
 can
 can
 we


actually,
 you
 know,
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of


that
 Nvidia
 H200?
 And
 I
 think
 maybe
 that


could
 create
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 catalyst
 for


Nvidia
 today
 now
 that
 you
 have
 10
 cent,


Alibaba
 coming
 out
 saying,
 hey,
 like
 we


wouldn't
 mind
 getting
 some
 of
 those


H200s
 and
 as
 a
 result
 that
 could
 create


some
 momentum
 for
 the
 broader
 chip


sector
 in
 general.
 So
 that's
 what
 we


got.
 A
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 Uh
 I
 am


feeling
 a
 bit
 better.
 Still
 not
 100%.
 Uh


it
 it
 you
 know
 it
 hasn't
 been
 sneezing


over
 the
 past
 couple
 days.
 This
 morning


it
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 sneezing.
 So
 I
 hope
 it's


not
 too
 bad
 throughout
 the
 show.
 It
 was


more
 sniffling
 over
 the
 past
 couple


days.
 Um
 so
 the
 sniffling
 is
 kind
 of


stopping,
 but
 the
 sneezing
 is
 there.
 And


I
 I
 don't
 know
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 my


throat,
 but
 it's
 still
 it's
 still
 kind


of
 hurting.
 So
 just
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a


crazy
 infection
 or
 anything.
 I've
 just


been
 trying
 to
 get
 enough
 sleep
 to
 get


rid
 of
 everything
 at
 least
 in
 terms
 of


the
 uh
 the
 feeling
 of
 being
 sick.
 But
 I


don't
 have
 a
 fever,
 anything
 like
 that.


So,
 I
 don't know.
 I
 think
 we'll
 be
 okay.


Yeah,
 I'm
 definitely
 still
 congested


100%.
 Definitely
 definitely
 still


congested.
 I
 had
 a
 busy
 day
 yesterday.


My
 day
 didn't
 end
 until
 like
 11:30
 last


night.
 There
 was
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 different


things
 to
 get
 done.
 So,
 I
 just
 kind
 of


ended
 up
 sleeping
 late
 again.
 So,
 I


think
 just
 getting
 a
 good
 night
 of
 sleep


will
 uh
 will
 hopefully
 help
 this
 as


well.
 [laughter]


Blame
 your
 dentist.


All
 right,
 let's
 get
 into
 it.
 Um,
 also


we
 got
 Oracle
 and
 Adobe
 today.
 So,
 I'll


be
 live
 with
 Neil,
 I
 think
 with
 Jose
 as


well.
 But
 Oracle
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big


one,
 dude.
 And
 I
 I've
 been
 debating


taking
 an
 earnings
 trade
 on
 this
 one


because
 I
 feel
 like
 it's
 going
 to
 pump,


but
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 do
 it
 because
 I


just
 don't
 know
 enough
 about
 Oracle
 or


their
 debt
 profile.
 I
 know
 their
 debt


profile
 is
 not
 pretty
 with
 40
 billion
 of


debt.
 So,
 if
 they
 don't
 announce
 one
 of


those
 open
 AI
 types
 of
 contracts
 that


they
 announced
 last
 time
 in
 September,


uh
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 Oracle
 is
 really


going
 to
 pump.
 So,
 I'm
 probably
 going
 to


sit
 out
 on
 this
 one.
 But,
 this
 is
 going


to
 be
 a
 massive
 one
 for
 the
 AI
 earnings


life
 cycle.
 And
 so
 we'll
 get
 into
 Adobe


and
 Oracle
 today
 after
 the
 bell
 and


we'll
 see
 uh
 we'll
 see
 what
 it
 goes
 from


there.
 All right,
 let's
 get
 started.


Let's
 start
 off
 with
 Paler.
 So
 yesterday


night,
 Paler
 actually
 pumped
 to
 $193


and
 uh
 it
 was
 pretty
 incredible.
 It


didn't
 sustain
 that
 pump
 and
 and
 maybe


it,
 you
 know,
 breaks
 out
 again
 today.


Maybe
 it
 continues
 to
 stay
 around
 this


range,
 but
 he
 did
 have
 some
 active


buyers
 coming
 into
 Palunteer.
 The
 reason


for
 that
 was
 because
 they
 got
 a
 pretty


big
 deal.
 $448
 million
 strategic


investment
 in
 the
 ship
 building


operating
 system
 aka
 ship
 OS
 to


accelerate
 the
 adoption
 of
 AI
 and


autonomy
 technologies
 across
 the


industrial
 base.
 This
 is
 something
 we've


been
 talking
 about
 for
 a
 very
 long
 time,


especially
 Gokarp.
 Shout
 out
 to
 him.


He's
 been
 on
 the
 show
 multiple
 times


over
 the
 past
 year
 uh
 as
 we
 did
 like
 our


Palunteer
 Sunday
 morning
 sessions
 and


he's
 been
 saying
 the
 Navy
 is
 going
 to


come
 through
 with
 a
 big
 big
 check.
 And


yesterday
 we
 got
 $450
 million
 for
 two


years.
 Not
 five
 years,
 not
 10
 years,
 two


years.
 $450
 million
 for
 pounder.
 Very


very
 exciting.
 Now
 what
 is
 the
 point
 of


this
 deal?
 At
 its
 core,
 pounder
 is


becoming
 the
 deacto
 operating
 system
 for


the
 west
 and
 particularly
 for
 the
 United


States
 government.
 Which
 means
 every


single
 sector
 of
 the
 government
 is


finding
 new
 use
 cases
 to
 implement


pounder
 software.
 In
 terms
 of
 this
 use


case,
 it
 is
 for


as
 per
 the
 secretary
 of
 the
 navy,
 ship


OS
 is
 not
 just
 new
 software.
 It
 is
 a
 new


way
 of
 doing
 business
 that
 puts


balancers
 cutting
 edge
 tools
 in
 the


hands
 of
 decision
 makers
 at
 every
 level,


giving
 them
 complete,
 accurate
 and


real-time
 feedback
 across
 the
 supply


chain.
 This
 is
 how
 we
 turn
 America's


technological
 edge
 into
 maritime


industrial
 dominance.
 Now
 we
 build
 a


true
 golden
 age
 at
 sea.
 Ship
 OS
 will


leverage
 Pure
 software
 to
 bring
 modern


best
 practices
 to
 see
 the
 complex
 data


heavy
 environment
 of
 Navy
 ship
 building.


So
 this
 is
 pretty
 exciting
 because
 again


we're
 seeing
 a
 massive
 level
 of


infrastructure
 and
 software
 investments


from
 the
 US
 government.
 Number
 two,


Pounder
 has
 already
 worked
 in
 the
 ship


building
 ecosystem
 for
 the
 past
 five


years.
 For
 those
 that
 remember
 the
 uh


Hyundai
 Heavy
 Industries
 uh
 contract,
 45


million
 for
 five
 years,
 HHI,
 this
 was


back
 in
 2022.
 They
 got
 an
 extension
 from


a
 2020
 partnership
 that
 they
 signed
 with


them
 early
 on.
 And
 it
 all
 had
 to
 do
 with


ship
 building
 and
 using
 Foundry


essentially
 as
 an
 operating
 system
 for


the
 complex
 navigation
 of
 what
 it
 means


to
 actually
 build
 a
 ship
 uh
 take
 down
 a


ship,
 ship
 a
 ship
 to
 a
 different


country.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 different


nuance
 to
 what
 it
 means
 to
 engage
 in


ship
 building
 and
 it's
 a
 massive
 massive


industry
 especially
 for
 the
 Navy
 and
 now


Pounder
 officially
 got
 this
 contract.
 So


does
 this
 mean
 the
 stock
 is
 going
 to


pump
 up
 back
 to
 195
 or
 back
 to
 200?
 I


mean
 we're
 going
 to
 see.
 Last
 night
 it


made
 an
 attempt
 for
 that.
 I
 I
 think
 the


the
 more
 important
 relevant
 thing
 about


this
 is
 that
 again
 the
 bears
 on


Palenteer
 particularly
 the
 Michael


Burries
 of
 the
 world
 are
 annoyed
 at
 the


valuation
 and
 they're
 annoyed
 at
 I
 guess


the
 CEO
 and
 how
 Karp
 acts
 or
 whatever.


Um
 but
 they
 cannot
 deny
 the
 growth
 right


now.
 they
 can
 get
 annoyed
 that
 the


valuation
 is
 too
 aggressive
 for
 the


growth
 that
 they're
 getting.
 But
 then


you
 have
 to
 look
 at
 the
 quality
 of


growth,
 right?
 The
 second
 derivative
 of


growth
 is
 what
 types
 of
 contracts
 are


they
 getting?
 Because
 the
 the
 sort
 of


important
 analysis
 about
 this
 and
 it
 was


the
 important
 analysis
 back
 when
 the


stock
 was
 $20
 and
 they
 were
 getting


similar
 deals
 like
 this
 is
 that
 this
 is


going
 to
 be
 sticky.
 This
 is
 going
 to
 be


reoccurring.
 This
 is
 probably
 going
 to


be
 upgraded
 to
 a
 much
 larger
 contract


over
 the
 next
 two
 years
 if
 shows
 they


can
 do
 a
 good
 job,
 which
 has
 constantly


shown
 that
 uh
 if
 you
 give
 them
 the


chance,
 they
 can
 prove
 that
 they
 can


generate
 value.
 And
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be


something
 that
 other
 countries
 that
 also


need
 ship
 building
 in
 their
 governments


are
 going
 to
 be
 looking
 at
 and
 saying,


"Hey,
 if
 Palantry
 can
 do
 it
 for
 the


United
 States
 government,
 maybe
 they
 can


do
 it
 for
 Ireland
 or
 Japan
 or
 all
 these


other
 different
 nations
 that
 they're


already
 working
 in
 uh
 in
 the
 context
 of


ship
 building."
 So,
 I
 just
 think
 that


the
 reason
 the
 street's
 going
 to


continue
 giving
 this
 a
 premium
 or
 at


least
 holding
 the
 premium
 where
 it
 is
 is


because
 the
 type
 of
 quality
 of
 revenue


along
 with
 the
 rate
 of
 growth
 that
 I


mean
 when
 you're
 getting
 a
 $450
 million


contract
 for
 two
 years,
 it's
 not
 going


to
 be
 uh
 the
 easiest
 to
 start
 growing


at,
 you
 know,
 or
 start
 deacelerating


back
 to
 20%
 when
 you're
 growing
 at
 60%.


That
 is
 why
 Paler
 maintains
 its
 momentum


and
 that's
 why
 it's
 very
 exciting
 to
 see


what
 we've
 got
 going
 on
 here.
 So,
 very


big
 deal
 for
 Palanteer.
 This
 news
 broke


yesterday
 after
 hours.
 didn't
 make
 too


much
 uh
 news
 last
 night,
 but
 I
 think
 it


was
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 delayed
 reaction.
 We'll


see.
 I
 mean,
 maybe
 the
 market
 this
 thing


got
 to
 193
 now.
 Maybe
 that
 was
 just
 some


shenanigans
 with
 people
 buying
 it
 up
 and


down,
 but
 maybe
 this
 thing
 does
 have
 a


little bit
 of
 breakout
 as
 we
 open
 today.


And
 then
 if
 it
 doesn't,
 then
 if
 it


continues
 to
 stay
 at
 these
 levels,
 I'm


fine
 with
 that
 as
 well.
 Uh
 the
 fact


that,
 you
 know,
 we
 fell
 to
 140
 and
 we're


back
 at
 180
 is
 not
 the
 worst
 thing
 for


Palanteer.
 So,
 very
 exciting
 stuff.
 Up


about
 1.68%
 of
 the
 pre-markets
 and
 that


is
 the
 update
 on
 Palanteer.
 S&P
 500


basically
 flat.
 You
 got
 Bitmine
 that's


up
 a
 little
 bit.
 Crypto
 and
 uh
 or


Ethereum
 and
 Bitcoin
 massive
 massive
 day


yesterday.
 Ethereum
 right
 there
 still


holding
 3,300
 and
 BTC
 is
 holding
 92,000.


It
 did
 get
 to
 94,000
 yesterday.
 Those


candles
 haven't
 really
 been
 faded.
 I


mean
 both
 of
 these
 were
 at
 3100
 and


90,000
 yesterday.
 They
 got
 two
 $3,000


candles
 and
 they
 didn't
 necessarily


leave
 even
 if
 they've,
 you
 know,
 gone


down
 a
 little
 bit
 from
 their
 peak.
 And


so
 that's
 nice
 to
 see
 for
 crypto
 where


the
 question
 is
 is
 it
 pricing
 in
 the


rate
 cut
 or
 is
 it
 kind
 of
 front
 running


the
 rate
 cut?
 We'll
 talk
 more
 about
 the


rate
 cut,
 but
 uh
 it
 is
 nice
 to
 see


crypto
 start
 to
 participate
 a
 little
 bit


after
 being
 stuck
 over
 the
 past
 couple


weeks.
 GE
 Veronova
 increased
 their


buyback
 from
 6
 billion
 to
 10
 billion,


which
 was
 massive,
 massive
 news.
 This
 is


169
 billion
 companies,
 up
 10%
 in
 the


pre-market,
 and
 they
 increased
 their


dividend.
 So,
 you're
 getting
 a
 lot
 of


momentum
 right
 here
 for
 some
 of
 these


other
 AI
 names,
 especially
 in
 the
 energy


space
 that
 are
 just
 doing
 really


shareholder
 friendly
 things
 like


increasing
 the
 dividend
 and
 buying
 back


your
 stock.
 And
 that's
 why
 GEV


is
 up
 10%
 right
 here.
 Uh
 let's
 talk


about
 Nvidia,
 but
 real
 quick,
 the
 10ear.


So
 yes,
 this
 is
 also
 something
 that's


not
 necessarily
 the
 best
 thing
 to
 see.


10
 years
 at
 the
 highest
 level
 in
 about
 5


months,
 4.2.
 I
 think
 the
 credit
 market


is
 basically
 saying
 we
 don't
 want
 a
 rate


cut,
 which
 is
 counterintuitive
 to
 a
 lot


of
 things
 that
 we've
 been
 hearing
 over


the
 past
 couple
 weeks.
 But
 maybe
 the


credit
 market
 right
 here
 is
 saying,


"Hey,
 we
 think
 there's
 an
 issue
 in
 Japan


that
 potentially
 could
 affect
 the
 United


States."
 And
 number
 two,
 uh,
 you
 know,


inflation
 still
 might
 be
 an
 issue.


Therefore,
 we
 can't
 easily
 say
 that
 a


rate
 cut
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 best
 thing


in
 the
 world.
 And
 this,
 what
 you're


looking
 at
 right
 here,
 this
 4.2%
 on
 the


tenure,
 given
 that
 we
 were
 below
 4%
 4


weeks
 ago,
 this
 is
 why
 Powell
 will
 be


hawkish.
 Yes.
 Meetings
 at
 2:30.
 Meetings


at
 [snorts]
 2:30
 p.m.
 Eastern.
 This
 is


likely
 why
 Pal
 will
 be
 hawkish
 because


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 if
 he's
 super


doubbish
 and
 he's
 like,
 "Everything's


great.
 We're
 cutting
 rates.
 Things
 are


okay.
 Inflation
 is
 not
 a
 concern."
 No,


the
 credit
 market's
 going
 to
 let
 him


know.
 maybe
 you
 can't
 be
 that
 doubbish.


Now,
 obviously,
 the
 stock
 market
 would


love
 him
 to
 be
 that
 doubbish.
 Trump


would
 love
 him
 to
 be
 that
 doubbish,


unfortunately.
 Uh
 he's
 not
 going
 to
 be


in
 that
 route
 because
 inflation
 still
 is


a
 concern
 perceptually
 in
 the
 data.


Inflation
 is
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a
 concern


yet.
 I
 mean,
 like
 given
 the
 data
 we've


seen,
 I
 know
 we
 don't
 have
 October
 PPI,


so
 maybe,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 it
 is
 a
 big


deal,
 but
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 that


data
 anytime
 soon.
 Um,
 from
 what
 we're


seeing,
 inflation
 is
 not
 ramping
 up
 that


aggressively.
 So,
 the
 question
 is
 just


going
 to
 be
 how
 the
 credit
 market


interprets
 this
 rate
 cut.
 they've


probably
 interpreted
 that
 we're
 getting


25
 pips.
 And
 then
 does
 the
 rising
 of
 the


10-year
 yield,
 aka
 people
 selling
 off


bonds,
 does
 that
 actually
 affect
 the


stock
 market
 in
 a
 negative
 way?
 Because


one
 could
 argue
 that
 people
 are
 going
 to


be
 selling
 off
 bonds
 and
 that
 money
 is


going
 to
 be
 coming
 right
 into
 the
 market


because
 they'd
 rather
 buy
 Nvidia
 versus


hold
 on
 to
 a
 10-year.
 It's
 not
 good
 for


the
 US
 refinancing
 of
 debt
 because
 we


need
 those
 yields
 to
 go
 down,
 but
 it


could
 be
 good
 for
 the
 stock
 market.
 So,


we
 are
 going
 to
 see,
 but
 that
 is
 one


thing
 that
 we
 definitely
 do
 have
 to
 care


about.
 2
 PM
 is
 the
 decision.
 2
 PM
 or
 2


PM
 is
 the
 decision.
 2:30
 is
 the


conference
 call.
 So,
 I'll
 be
 live
 at


2:20.
 I'll
 be
 live
 10
 minutes
 before,


but
 2
 PM
 Eastern
 uh
 is
 the
 decision.
 And


we're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 summary
 of
 economic


projections
 as
 well.
 So,
 we're
 going to


get
 a
 dot
 plot,
 which
 is
 going
 to
 show


how
 the
 Fed
 is
 thinking
 of
 rate
 cuts


going
 into
 2026.
 By
 the
 way,
 JPAL
 has


four
 meetings
 left
 after
 this
 one.
 So,


uh,
 if
 if
 those
 meetings
 are
 not
 going


to
 give
 us
 a
 rate
 cut,
 which
 so
 far
 the


Fed
 futures
 are
 not
 really
 pricing
 in
 a


rate
 cut
 until
 after
 May
 of
 2026,


then
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 his
 last
 rate


cut.


And
 uh,
 this
 might
 be
 the
 last
 time
 we


see
 JPL
 actually
 give
 us
 a
 cut.
 And
 I'm


sure
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 of


people
 betting
 on
 what
 he's
 going to
 say


in
 this
 meeting,
 but
 this
 might
 be
 his


last
 actual
 meeting
 where
 he
 ends
 up


easing
 monetary
 policy.
 Uh,
 Nvidia.
 So,


news
 this
 morning.
 China's
 reportedly


called
 emergency
 meetings
 with
 Alibaba,


Bite
 Dance,
 and
 Tencent
 to
 size
 demand


for
 Nvidia's
 H200
 AI
 chips.
 I
 think
 this


could
 be
 the
 headline
 that
 really
 really


makes
 Nvidia
 make
 a
 move
 today.
 Now,
 I'm


not
 I
 I
 I
 I
 there's
 no
 way
 to
 guarantee


that
 could
 happen,
 but
 the
 the
 only


reason
 Nvidia
 fell
 yesterday
 was
 because


there
 was
 all
 these
 bearish
 headlines


that
 China
 came
 out
 and
 said, "We
 don't


want
 your
 chips."
 And
 now,
 obviously,


China
 says
 one
 thing,
 they
 do
 the
 other.


Now,
 they're
 in
 meetings
 with
 a
 lot
 of


their
 tech
 companies,
 not
 only
 about


Nvidia
 chips.
 The
 article
 goes
 on
 to


report
 about
 how
 they're
 trying
 to
 size


up.
 Hey,
 can
 we
 give
 you
 enough
 Huawei


chips?
 Maybe
 we
 buy
 5%
 of
 Nvidia
 chips,


you
 can
 do
 the
 rest
 with
 the
 Huawei


chips.
 I'm
 sure
 the
 Alibaba
 and
 the
 Tens


people
 are
 going
 to
 be
 like,
 can
 we
 just


get
 100%
 of
 the
 Nvidia
 chips?
 Can
 we


just
 like
 can
 we
 just
 get
 the
 chips?


Like,
 do
 we
 really
 have
 to
 keep
 playing


this
 game?
 Like,
 we
 know
 the
 Nvidia


chips
 are
 better.
 And
 maybe
 there's
 a


world
 in
 which
 the
 Chinese
 uh
 tech


executives
 can
 convince
 the
 CCP
 to
 allow


them
 to
 buy
 these
 Nvidia
 chips.
 And
 if


so,
 that's
 just
 more
 revenue
 for
 Jensen


that
 has
 not
 been
 accounted
 for,
 which


would
 be
 very,
 very
 bullish
 and
 I
 think


probably
 help
 get
 the
 stock
 back
 into


that
 185
 range.
 I
 mean,
 the
 China
 stuff


really
 is
 a
 gamecher
 simply
 for
 the
 idea


that
 none
 of
 it
 is
 priced
 in
 and
 there's


already
 so
 much
 that
 is
 uh
 priced
 in


from
 a
 domestic
 demand
 perspective
 that


is
 already
 trading
 at
 24
 or
 25
 times


earnings,
 which
 is
 cheap
 in
 and
 of


itself.
 If
 you
 get
 China
 in
 the
 mix
 and


potentially
 we
 get
 down
 to
 like
 23
 times


earnings,
 I
 think
 it
 becomes
 more


obvious
 buy.
 There's
 also
 a
 new
 Chinese


model
 called
 Kimmy
 and
 um
 Kimmy
 is
 one


is
 number
 21
 on
 the
 app
 store.
 You
 guys


can
 download
 it
 if
 you're
 interesting


interested
 in
 it.
 It
 is
 a
 a
 Chinese


model.
 And
 the
 fun
 thing
 about
 this,


yes,
 I
 know
 my
 phone
 has
 no
 battery.
 It


never
 has
 battery.
 I
 said
 uh
 last
 night,


is
 Taiwan
 a
 country?
 [snorts]


And
 look
 what
 happens.


Sorry,
 I
 cannot
 provide
 this


information.
 Please
 feel
 free
 to
 ask


another
 question.


And
 then
 I
 typed
 in
 Pooh
 Bear


and
 everyone
 knows
 or
 some
 people
 might


know
 about
 Pooh
 Bear.
 Okay,
 this
 time


it's
 answering
 it.
 Yesterday


uh
 Z.
 So
 I
 said,
 "Does
 Z
 look
 like
 Pooh


Bear?"


You're
 you're
 not
 allowed
 to
 talk
 about


Pooh
 Bear
 in
 China
 because
 um
 yeah,


look,
 I'm
 sorry.
 I
 cannot
 answer
 that


question.


It's
 like
 illegal
 to
 compare
 Xi
 who


looks
 like
 Pooh
 Bear
 to
 Pooh
 Bear


because
 like
 the
 Chinese
 government
 has


outlawed
 it.
 So
 again,
 these
 uh
 these


Chinese
 models
 like
 what
 like
 like
 when


when
 you
 play
 around
 with
 it
 and
 you


just
 see
 the
 automatic
 censorship
 on
 any


of
 these
 questions
 immediately
 I
 think


this
 is
 why
 the
 American
 models
 have
 to


win
 and
 the
 American
 tech
 stack
 has
 to


win
 because
 this
 stuff
 cannot
 be
 the


mainstream
 models
 that
 exist.
 Now,
 it's


not
 like
 the
 American
 models
 are


perfect.
 Obviously,
 there's
 issues
 with


American
 models
 as
 well.
 But
 the
 sort
 of


just
 like
 explicit
 censorship
 of
 certain


topics
 like
 Taiwan
 because
 the
 CCP


doesn't
 want
 Chinese
 companies
 enforcing


the
 ability
 for
 users
 to
 gain
 access
 to


that
 information
 because
 they
 see
 it
 as


propaganda
 immediately
 lets
 you
 know
 why


the
 American
 models
 have
 to
 win.
 So,


yeah,
 your
 boy
 is
 never
 going
 to
 China,


dude.
 Your
 boy's
 never
 going
 to
 China.


Like,
 look,
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 I
 I
 have
 a


lot
 of
 respect
 for
 China,
 and
 I
 know
 a


lot
 of
 people
 that
 have
 went
 to
 China.


I'm
 sure
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 in
 the
 chat
 have


traveled
 to
 China.
 I
 am
 just
 paranoid


about
 China
 because
 I've
 said
 a
 lot
 of


[ __ ]
 on
 this
 show
 that
 is
 not
 like


friendly
 about
 the
 CCP.
 Like
 like
 if
 if


you
 really
 go
 through
 the
 catalog
 of


like
 the
 thousand
 shows
 I've
 done
 over


the
 past
 couple
 years,
 I
 have
 said
 some


[ __ ]
 about
 the
 CCP.
 And
 so
 I
 am


genuinely
 afraid
 that
 if
 I
 step
 in
 that


country,
 they
 have
 a
 record
 of
 me
 and


immediately
 I'm
 not
 on
 American
 soil


anymore.
 I
 mean
 at
 that
 point
 it's


Chinese
 laws.
 So,
 like
 I
 would
 love
 to


visit
 China.
 There's
 a
 bunch
 of
 things


in
 China
 I
 would
 love
 to
 see.
 But
 I
 like


I'm
 actually
 paranoid
 based
 on
 me
 just


being
 a
 public
 figure
 and
 saying
 stuff


about
 them
 that
 if
 I
 ever
 stepped
 foot


it
 would
 it
 would
 be
 ugly.
 So,
 I
 don't


think
 your
 boy's
 ever
 visiting
 China.


But
 these
 models
 are
 not
 necessarily
 the


most
 conducive
 to
 free
 speech.
 So,
 we're


really
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 how
 they
 end


up
 getting
 trained.
 The
 point
 is
 they


want
 more
 Nvidia
 H200
 chips,
 which
 is


going
 to
 be
 hopefully
 overall
 bullish


for
 Nvidia.


go
 to
 North
 Korea
 instead,


you'll
 be
 detained.
 Look,
 maybe
 it's
 not


going
 to
 be
 that
 serious.
 I
 don't
 like


sometimes
 people
 say
 I'm
 exaggerating


it,
 which
 I
 probably
 am.
 It's
 probably


not
 that
 serious,
 like
 China's
 not
 North


Korea,
 but
 still,
 dude.
 Like,
 it's
 it's


scary
 to
 just
 step
 in
 there
 and
 maybe


you
 never
 know
 what
 the
 CCP
 has
 on
 you.


I
 mean,
 they
 have
 that
 social
 credit


system.
 They
 have
 a
 little
 score
 on
 how


good
 of
 a
 citizen
 you
 are.
 And
 maybe
 it


wouldn't
 apply
 to
 me
 when
 I
 get
 there,


but
 still,
 it
 is
 a
 bit
 more
 scary
 to
 me.


Um,
 okay.
 Meta.
 We
 got
 a
 big
 deal
 for


Meta.
 Meta
 plans
 price
 hike
 for
 its


virtual
 reality
 devices.


This
 is
 kind
 of
 bullish
 because
 you're


tying
 it
 with
 uh
 the
 other
 piece
 of
 news


that
 we
 had.
 Meta.
 Wow.
 Meta's
 down
 on


this.
 Huh.
 I
 thought
 Meta
 would
 be
 up


right
 here.
 You're
 tying
 this
 with
 the


Metaverse
 news
 that
 came
 last
 last
 week.


Uh
 which
 was
 that
 they
 were
 scaling
 back


30%
 of
 the
 workforce
 in
 the
 Metverse.


That
 hasn't
 been
 confirmed
 by
 Meta,
 by


the
 way.
 That
 was
 a
 Bloomberg
 rumor,
 so


we
 don't
 officially
 know
 if
 it's


confirmed,
 but
 that
 is
 something
 that


came
 out.
 And
 now
 you
 have
 price
 hacks


on
 their
 virtual
 reality
 products
 as
 per


Business
 Insider.
 One
 could
 argue
 this


could
 decrease
 demand
 for
 the
 price


cycle
 of
 its
 VR
 devices
 going
 into
 the


holiday
 season.
 So
 that
 could
 be
 why


it's
 kind
 of
 bearish.
 The
 other
 argument


could
 be
 there's
 not
 that
 much
 demand,


so
 you
 might
 as
 well
 increase
 the
 prices


and
 try
 to
 get
 as
 much
 you
 can
 from
 the


average
 order
 value
 on
 consumers.
 Meta


right
 here,
 that's
 down
 about
 1%.
 still


up
 nicely
 from
 that
 585
 level
 that
 it


was
 at
 two
 weeks
 ago
 at
 650,
 but
 it
 was


also
 at
 680


a
 couple
 of
 weeks
 ago
 as
 well.
 On
 top
 of


that,
 you've
 got
 more
 EU
 lawsuits.
 So,
 I


again
 there's
 not
 a
 bare
 case
 on
 Meta


from
 the
 actual
 business
 outside
 of
 the


where
 is
 the
 capex
 going to
 go.
 You
 have


that
 avocado
 model
 that's
 rumored
 to
 be


launching
 in
 Q1
 of
 2026.
 I
 think
 the


overarching
 bare
 case
 on
 the
 company
 is


just
 or
 I
 guess
 the
 narrative
 is
 does


the
 street
 believe
 that
 the
 ROI
 from
 AI


is
 going
 to
 happen
 and
 if
 they
 don't


believe
 that's
 going
 to
 happen
 you
 know


that's
 where
 you
 get
 uh
 a
 bit
 more


scared
 about
 where
 the
 stock
 can
 go
 but


these
 sort
 of
 idiosyncratic
 things
 about


the
 metaverse
 and
 VR
 and
 you
 know


scaling
 back
 some
 of
 their
 spend
 like
 I


don't
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 make
 the


biggest
 difference
 in
 the
 stock
 the


biggest
 difference
 is
 going
 to
 be
 where


does
 the
 company
 go
 from
 here
 in
 regards


to
 AI
 spend
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 over


the
 coming
 days
 how
 that
 ends
 up
 playing


out.
 Um,
 you
 got
 a
 Bloomberg
 headline


right
 here.
 Mark
 Zuckerberg
 month
 months


into
 building
 one
 of the
 priciest
 teams


in
 technology
 history
 is
 getting


personally
 involved
 in
 day-to-day
 work


and
 pivoting
 Meta's
 focus
 to
 an
 AI
 model


it
 can
 make
 money
 off
 of.
 Yeah,
 that's


basically
 the
 headline
 we
 had
 yesterday


for
 Avocado.
 Um,


and
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 Microsoft
 right


there.
 Microsoft
 down
 2%.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 there's
 a
 headline
 there.
 We'll
 see


in
 a
 second,
 but
 Microsoft
 down
 about


1.75.
 That's
 essentially
 what
 we
 saw


yesterday.
 Also,
 you've
 got
 some
 other


quotes
 from
 this
 Bloomberg
 article
 right


here.
 Uh,
 Meta
 is
 refining
 their
 new
 AI


model
 using
 Alibaba's
 Quen.
 Meta
 is


developing
 a
 model
 codenamed
 Avocado
 we


talked
 about
 yesterday.
 Meta's
 Alexander


Wang
 at
 times
 is
 frustrated
 by


Zuckerberg's
 micromanagement.


Huh.


I
 mean,
 I
 could
 understand
 being


frustrated
 by
 Zuck's
 micromanagement
 if


he
 paid
 you
 $15
 billion
 to
 be
 the
 chief


AI
 scientist
 at
 the
 company.


Nonetheless,
 if
 Alexander
 Wang
 is
 not


really
 producing
 results,
 I
 can


understand
 why
 Zuckerberg
 also
 wants
 to


micromanage.
 But
 those
 are
 the
 quotes


from
 this
 Bloomberg
 article.
 Maybe


that's
 why
 the
 stock
 is
 down
 a
 little


bit
 right
 here
 in
 the
 pre-markets.


Alexander
 Wang
 was
 the
 founder
 of
 Scale


AI
 that
 Zucks
 paid
 50
 billion
 to
 buy
 50%


of
 their
 company,
 which
 I
 really
 don't


know
 if
 that
 was
 the
 best
 use
 of


shareholder
 capital.
 That
 was
 that
 was
 I


don't
 know.
 I
 guess
 we'll
 find
 out
 if


that
 was
 the
 case,
 but
 maybe
 a
 little


bit
 of
 beef
 that's
 that's
 going
 on


there.


Um,
 okay.
 So,
 that's
 what
 we
 have
 access


to
 on
 Meta.
 Doug
 says,
 "Mom,
 the
 bear


case
 on
 Meta
 is
 that
 they
 lose
 access
 to


teenagers
 during
 the
 most
 formative


addictive
 years
 of
 social
 media."
 Yeah,


I
 mean,
 the
 idea
 that
 Instagram
 and


Facebook
 lose
 their
 popularity


definitely
 could
 be
 a
 bare
 case
 for
 I


just
 I
 personally
 haven't
 seen
 that


happen.
 I
 mean,
 every
 year
 we
 think


Facebook
 and
 Instagram
 are
 dying
 out.


They
 continue
 to
 show
 these
 user
 numbers


grow
 higher.
 So,
 yeah,
 that
 is
 an


argument.
 And
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 that's


that's
 always
 been
 Sam
 Alman's
 critique


of
 Meta
 is
 that
 chat
 makes
 you
 feel
 good


after
 you
 use
 it
 because
 it's
 like


actually
 encouraging.
 And
 uh
 you
 know,


Facebook
 makes
 you
 feel
 like
 crap,


Instagram
 makes
 you
 feel
 like
 crap,


which
 is
 right.
 Like
 just
 objectively,


Instagram
 makes
 you
 feel
 like
 crap.
 No,


no
 matter
 how
 much
 self-confidence
 or


self-esteem
 you
 have,
 when
 you're


scrolling
 through
 Instagram
 and
 you're


seeing
 all
 these
 other
 people
 living


their
 life,
 doing
 things
 in
 their
 life


that
 they're
 already
 creating
 like
 a


perception
 around,
 and
 then
 you
 see


these
 celebrities
 that
 pop
 up
 in
 your


feed,
 you
 already
 feel
 bad
 about


yourself
 because
 you're
 like,
 "Oh,
 I'm


not
 doing
 as
 much
 as
 these
 people.
 I'm


not
 living
 the
 life
 that
 these
 people


are
 living."
 But
 chat
 GBT,
 when
 you're


asking
 these
 personal
 questions
 and


trying
 to
 grow
 and
 get
 better,
 learn
 a


new
 skill,
 like
 intrinsically
 there's
 a


different
 feeling
 right
 there
 that
 it's


substantially
 better.
 there's
 not
 this


advertising
 machine
 that's
 trying
 to


just
 sell
 you
 more
 more
 dopamine
 and


like
 you
 feel
 like
 you're
 becoming
 a


better
 human
 being
 like
 that
 that
 is


objectively
 true.
 The
 problem
 is
 Zux
 has


been
 trying
 to
 interpolate
 that
 feeling


inside
 of
 Meta
 AI
 and
 and
 that's
 just


hasn't
 happened
 because
 I
 don't
 know


about
 you
 guys
 but
 I
 don't
 use
 Meta
 AI


to
 learn
 about
 a
 scale.
 I
 have
 been


really
 loving
 GPT
 by
 the
 way.
 I


subscribed
 two
 weeks
 ago
 and
 the
 20


bucks
 a
 month
 is
 well
 worth
 it.
 I
 mean,


like,
 it
 really
 is.
 Like,
 it
 is
 becoming


my
 go-to
 model
 again,
 and
 it's
 just


good.
 It's
 really
 good.
 Someone
 says
 GPT


glazes
 too
 much.
 GPT
 definitely
 glazes


too
 much,
 but
 it
 glazes
 in
 a


intellectual
 way.
 Like,
 if
 you're
 full


of
 [ __ ]
 it's
 going
 to
 tell
 you
 you're


full
 of
 [ __ ]
 It's
 going
 to
 really
 try


to
 say
 it
 in
 a
 in
 a
 way
 that
 doesn't


hurt
 your
 feelings,
 but
 eventually
 they


will
 call
 you
 out
 on
 your
 [ __ ]
 But


if
 you're
 trying
 to
 just
 like
 learn


something
 new
 or
 get
 better
 at


something,
 it
 really
 is
 very


encouraging.


And
 I
 just
 have
 a
 way
 better
 time
 using


that
 than


than
 using
 uh
 Instagram.
 SoFi
 SoFi


headline
 introducing
 the
 SoFi
 smart


card.
 The
 best
 all-in-one
 account.
 SoFi


right
 there,


of
 course,
 dropping
 in
 the
 pre-market


after
 that
 announcement.
 So,
 what
 do
 we


have
 on
 SoFi?
 Looks
 like
 they're


introducing
 some
 cash
 back
 on
 this
 new


card.
 Is
 this
 a
 credit
 card?
 I
 did
 buy


more
 SoFi
 yesterday
 below
 27.
 I
 mean,
 I


don't
 know,
 dude.
 I
 think
 this
 thing


should
 be
 closer
 to
 35.
 So,
 I've
 been


buying
 SoFi.
 I
 think
 it
 should
 be
 okay.


the
 new
 SoFi
 smart
 card.
 Uh,
 earn


rewards
 with
 5%
 cash
 back
 at
 grocery


stores.


Okay.


Uh,
 earn
 high
 interest
 up
 to
 4.3%
 API
 on


savings.
 Grow
 your
 credit
 score
 with


onetime
 payments.
 Exclusively
 available


with
 SoFi
 Plus.
 Get
 $1,000
 in
 annual


value
 with
 qualifying
 activities
 for


only
 $10
 a
 month.


Okay,


it's
 okay.
 It's
 not
 the
 3%
 Robinet


credit
 card.
 And
 again,
 I
 bought
 soof
 so


yesterday.
 So,
 like
 the
 only
 reason
 I'm


comparing
 it
 is
 because
 again
 to
 pay
 10


bucks
 a
 month
 to
 get
 access
 to
 this
 and


it's
 not
 exactly
 the
 perks
 that
 a
 hood


credit
 card
 can
 give
 you.
 Again,
 it's


just
 it's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 compete
 with


Robin
 Hood,
 which
 is
 five
 bucks
 a
 month


and
 you
 get,
 you
 know,
 3%
 cash
 back
 on


everything.
 I'm
 sure
 there
 will
 be
 some


people
 that
 really
 adopt
 this
 type
 of


card.
 The
 question
 is,
 you
 know,
 how


much
 is
 it
 going
 to
 contribute
 to
 the


bottom
 line
 for
 SoFi?
 Regardless
 of


that,
 um,
 I'm
 buying
 more
 SoFi,
 dude.
 I


really
 do
 think
 you're
 probably
 going
 to


get
 a
 move
 closer
 to
 35.
 Maybe
 not
 by


the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 We'll
 see
 if
 we
 get


that
 really
 big
 bull
 run.
 I
 think
 Hood,


look,
 I
 don't
 say
 this
 often,
 but
 I


think
 SoFi
 is
 a
 better
 buy
 than
 Hood


right
 here.
 And
 the
 only
 reason
 for
 that


is
 because
 Hood
 is
 now
 very
 close
 to
 its


all-time
 highs.
 I
 mean,
 yesterday
 was


pushing
 140.
 So,
 do
 I
 think
 so
 Hood
 can


get
 back
 to
 150
 by
 end
 of
 year?
 Yes,
 if


we
 have
 like
 a
 monster
 bull
 run.
 But
 if


that
 happens,
 Sofa
 should
 probably
 make


a
 move
 closer
 to
 35.
 And
 if
 it
 doesn't,


then
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 But
 I
 think
 it's


a
 safer
 buy
 right
 here
 than
 Hood
 simply


because
 Hood
 has
 made
 a
 big
 move
 from


100
 to
 135.


So
 I
 do
 think
 this
 one
 would
 not
 be


crazy
 in
 the
 short
 term
 to
 to
 get
 this


members
 earn
 unlimited
 5%
 cash
 back


rewards
 at
 grocery
 stores
 and
 up
 to
 4.3%


APY
 on
 saving
 balances.


Yeah,
 that
 is
 the
 new
 SoFi
 card,
 which


is
 what
 they
 announced
 here.
 It's


probably
 not
 on
 their
 website
 right
 now,


but
 it
 probably
 came
 through
 for
 the


email
 for
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 as
 well.
 $10


a
 month
 is
 annoying
 though,
 dude.
 I've


always
 been
 skeptical
 about
 Soapai's


Plus
 program.
 10
 bucks
 a
 month
 to
 get


access
 to
 some
 of
 this
 stuff.
 I
 mean,


it's
 cheap
 compared
 to
 other
 cards,
 but


I
 don't
 know if
 it's
 going
 to
 lead
 to


mass
 massive
 use
 growth.
 Pound
 right


there
 up
 1.3%
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 UNH
 is


flat.
 BMR
 is
 flat.
 S&P
 is
 flat.
 Broadcom


is
 earnings
 tomorrow,
 which
 is
 going
 to


be
 really
 important
 as
 well.
 Nebius


that's
 down
 about
 0.24
 and
 then
 IN


down.56.
 I
 mean
 pretty
 much
 everything's


actually
 down
 in
 the
 pre-markets.
 You're


not
 getting
 a
 massive
 move.
 Iroot
 once


again
 is
 up
 18%.
 The
 stock
 over
 the
 past


couple
 days
 has
 been
 up
 like
 10
 20%


every
 single
 day.
 Dualingo
 back
 above
 up


200.
 That's
 green
 a
 little
 bit.


Microsoft
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 headline
 for


why
 they're
 down
 2%.
 But
 it
 looks
 like


there's
 something
 for
 why
 they're
 down.


Everything
 else
 is
 red.
 Oh,
 Pab,
 shout


out
 to
 Stock
 Talk.
 This
 was
 another
 one


of
 his
 picks.
 Photonix,
 by
 the
 way,


we'll
 be
 live
 again.
 He
 has
 a
 new
 stock


we'll
 be
 talking
 about
 at
 12:30


on
 Twitter
 spaces.
 Last
 week,
 Twitter


spaces
 bugged
 out
 and
 it
 didn't
 even


work.
 So,
 hopefully
 there's
 no
 issue


today,
 but
 12:30
 I'll
 be
 live
 with
 him


again
 and
 we'll
 be
 discussing
 a
 new


stock.
 Uh,
 but
 Photronics,
 I
 think
 we


did
 a
 a
 spaces
 on
 this
 a
 couple
 weeks


ago,
 at least
 we
 mentioned
 it.
 Um,
 good


earnings.
 They
 beat
 on
 revenue,
 beat
 on


EPS
 by
 about
 10
 to
 15%.


And
 that's
 why
 that
 stock
 is
 up
 about


20%.
 Okay,
 Trump.
 So,
 Trump
 had
 uh
 a


bunch
 of
 different
 things
 to
 say


yesterday
 on
 the
 state
 of
 affordability


and
 the
 economy.
 Here's
 a
 couple
 of


those
 clips
 and
 we'll
 discuss
 some
 of


the
 stuff
 that
 he
 mentioned
 yesterday.


>> So,
 they
 look
 at
 the
 camera
 and
 they


say,
 "This
 election
 is
 all
 about


affordability.
 We're
 dealing
 with
 bad


people."
 And
 the
 word
 affordability
 is


the
 exact
 same
 thing.
 And
 I
 can't
 say


affordability
 hoax
 because
 I
 agree
 the


prices
 were
 too
 high.
 So
 I
 can't
 go
 to


hooks
 because
 they'll
 misconstrue
 that.


But
 they
 use
 the
 word
 affordability


and
 that's
 their
 only
 word.
 They
 say


affordability


and
 everyone
 says,
 "Oh,
 that
 must
 mean


Trump
 has
 high
 prices."
 No,
 our
 prices


are
 coming
 down
 tremendously
 from
 the


highest
 prices
 in
 the
 history
 of
 our


country.


>> So
 that
 between
 that
 and
 the


>> Okay.
 So,
 that
 was
 part
 of
 what
 Trump


said
 yesterday
 around
 affordability.
 He


talked
 a
 lot
 about
 how
 Pennsylvania
 in


particular
 has
 been
 starting
 to
 do
 very


well.
 Um,
 and
 that
 created
 some
 more


momentum
 in
 the
 the
 state
 of


Pennsylvania,
 which
 is
 why
 he's
 been


getting
 some
 more
 excitement.
 Uh,


another
 thing
 that
 he
 said,
 which
 I


think
 the
 street
 was
 also,


I
 don't know
 how
 the
 street
 is


interpreting
 it.
 We'll
 see
 what
 the


Supreme
 Court
 says
 about
 it.
 Is
 his


favorite
 word,
 which
 once
 again
 starts


with
 a
 T.


>> I
 said
 tariff.
 My
 favorite
 word
 is


tariff.


>> True.
 But
 then
 I
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 heat
 from


the
 fake
 news.
 I
 said,


>> I
 think
 in
 a
 couple
 weeks
 we're
 going
 to


see
 what
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 says
 and
 if


his
 favorite
 word
 continues
 to
 be
 tariff


or
 if
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 says
 yeah,
 we're


gonna
 have
 to
 reverse
 a
 lot
 of
 that


stuff.
 So
 again,
 I
 think
 the


affordability
 argument
 around
 the


Supreme
 Court
 or
 around
 the
 the
 the


Trump
 administration
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


big
 thing
 going
 into
 2026.
 Again,
 I


think
 the
 bull
 case
 for
 2026
 is
 Fed
 is


easing.
 Hopefully
 that
 continues
 and
 the


AI
 trade
 is
 intact.
 For
 the
 Republicans


to
 win
 the
 midterms,
 they're
 going to


have
 to
 win
 this
 argument
 around


affordability
 because
 it
 seems
 like
 that


is
 exactly
 what
 the
 Democrats
 are
 going


after
 as
 in
 terms
 of
 their
 main
 message.


And
 so
 I
 think
 more
 and
 more
 and
 more
 we


will
 be
 hearing
 the
 administration
 make


their
 case
 for
 why
 they
 are
 the
 most


affordable.
 You
 know,
 the
 question
 is


will
 the
 American
 people
 believe
 that?


And
 that's
 something
 we're
 going
 to
 have


to
 see
 going
 into
 the
 next
 coming


months.
 Uh,
 our
 boy
 Cleo
 Fields,
 which


is
 going
 to
 be
 taking
 over
 Nancy's


position
 once
 she
 retires,
 looks
 like
 he


loaded
 up
 on
 Netflix,
 folks.
 He
 bought


it
 at


a
 higher
 price
 than
 it
 is
 today.


November
 20th,
 he
 bought
 around
 200
 to


500
 grand
 of
 Niflex.


This
 has
 not
 been
 the
 best
 buy
 so
 far.


Netflix
 is
 down
 from
 those
 levels.
 Uh
 so


I
 mean
 it
 does
 seem
 like


you
 have
 a
 couple
 more
 politicians


outside
 of
 Cleop
 Fields
 that
 also
 loaded


up
 on
 Netflix.
 The
 thing
 about
 this
 here


and
 the
 reason
 why
 this
 is
 rather


interesting
 is
 because
 I
 mean
 look
 this


guy's
 in
 Congress.
 This
 guy
 probably
 has


a
 little
 bit
 more
 access
 to
 information


around
 if
 the
 deal
 is
 going to
 get
 done.


Now,
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 might
 rest
 on
 Trump's


shoulder
 on
 it,
 like
 if
 Paramount
 or
 um


Trump
 or
 Netflix
 is
 able
 to
 get
 Warner


Brothers,
 but
 if
 he
 has
 a
 little
 bit
 of


potential
 information
 that
 Netflix
 is


definitely
 going
 to
 get
 Warner
 Brothers,


you
 know,
 maybe
 that's
 why
 he
 ended
 up


getting
 some
 of
 these
 shares.
 So,
 he
 got


this
 around
 November
 20th.
 Again,
 he's


been
 actively
 buying
 a
 lot
 of
 stocks.


This
 guy
 is
 like
 legit
 legit
 in
 the


markets
 buying
 stuff.
 He
 got
 Iran
 at


like
 $10.
 He
 had
 Open
 Door
 before
 it


like
 ran
 up
 and
 he
 got
 it
 like
 two,


three
 bucks.
 But
 you
 do
 see
 him
 trading


and
 potentially
 Netflix
 is
 going
 to
 be


the
 next
 one
 that
 works
 out.
 Where
 is


Netflix
 in
 the
 pre-market?
 We
 got
 about


15
 minutes
 until
 the
 market
 opens.


Netflix
 right
 here.
 Yeah,
 still
 red.
 I


don't
 know.
 I'm
 staying
 out
 of
 Netflix.


I
 thought
 about
 it
 over
 the
 past
 couple


days
 after
 all
 this
 stuff
 happened
 over


the
 weekend
 where,
 you
 know,
 Trump's


going
 back
 and
 forth
 with
 all
 of
 them.
 I


do
 think
 Netflix
 going
 to
 end
 up
 getting


this.
 Like
 my
 gut
 tells
 me
 Netflix
 gets


that.
 Poly
 market
 says
 it's
 going to
 be


paramount.
 there's
 like
 a
 45%
 chance


that
 Paramount
 gets
 it.
 Um,
 I
 think


Netflix
 ends
 up
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 going


to
 be
 a
 long
 process


and
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I
 want
 to
 be
 part
 of


that
 process.
 Okay,
 let's
 do
 a
 poll


today.
 Red
 or
 green,
 what
 are
 we


thinking?
 Obviously,
 you
 know,
 the
 Fed


meeting
 is
 really
 going
 to
 determine
 how


this
 ends
 up
 playing
 out,
 but
 let's
 see


what
 some
 people
 think
 as
 we
 get


started.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 we
 have
 the
 Q3


employment
 cost
 index,
 which
 we
 got


about
 10
 minutes
 ago.
 Looks
 like
 that's


up
 a
 little
 bit.
 So,
 let's
 get
 that
 news


real
 quick
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going


from
 there.


>> What
 are
 the
 numbers?


>> The
 numbers
 are
 our
 third
 quarter


employment
 cost
 index
 up
 8/10en
 of
 a


percent.
 That's
 a
 smidge
 lighter
 than


the
 9/10
 we
 were
 expecting.
 And
 the
 last


three
 quarters
 have
 been
 9/10
 from
 the


last
 quarter
 24
 the
 first
 second
 quarter


this
 year.
 And
 as
 I
 said,
 this
 is
 the


third
 quarter
 and
 that
 would
 be
 the


lightest
 going
 back
 to
 wow,
 you
 have
 to


go
 back
 a
 ways
 to
 the
 second
 quarter
 of


2021.


It
 equaled
 it
 equal
 where we
 were
 in
 the


third
 quarter
 of
 last
 year.
 So
 it
 has


been
 more
 on
 the
 elevated
 side.
 The


all-time
 high
 was
 1.3%


and
 that
 was
 in
 the
 what
 second
 quarter


of
 22.
 And
 everybody
 remembers
 uh
 it
 was


the
 first
 half
 of
 2022
 where
 we
 had
 9.1%


uh
 inflation.
 So
 we
 do
 understand
 that


that
 is
 coming
 down
 somewhat.
 Uh
 what


isn't
 coming
 down?
 You
 hear
 those
 hoofs


in
 the
 background,
 Joe.
 That's
 the


vigilantes
 riding.
 You
 know,
 we
 settled


the
 tenure
 last
 year
 at
 457.
 Hey,
 I


wouldn't
 be
 shocked
 if
 we
 get
 much


closer
 to
 unchanged.
 We're
 hovering
 now


at
 420.
 Should
 we
 close
 anywhere
 418
 or


higher?
 Those
 are
 three
 month
 high
 yield


closes.
 If
 we
 look
 at


>> and
 that
 would
 not
 be
 pretty.
 I
 mean,
 if


we
 get
 anywhere
 near
 back
 to
 450
 on
 the


10-year,
 we
 might
 have
 a
 stock
 market


run,
 but
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 the
 credit


market
 screaming
 that
 they
 don't
 agree


with
 what's
 going
 on.
 And
 so,
 we're


really
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 today.


Again,
 I'll
 be
 live
 at
 2:20,
 2
 p.m.
 we


get
 the
 announcement.
 Eastern
 Standard,


2:30,
 we
 get
 the
 FOMC
 meeting
 and
 all
 of


us
 will
 come
 together
 to
 watch
 every


syllable
 that
 Jal
 says
 and
 how
 it


affects
 the
 broader
 market.
 We
 got
 a


piece
 of
 breaking
 news
 right
 here.


China's
 Deep
 Seek
 is
 set
 to
 announce
 a


new
 AI
 model
 that
 used
 Nvidia's
 Black


Bull
 chips,
 which
 were
 smuggled
 into
 the


country
 per
 the
 information.


Not
 sure
 how
 credible
 that
 is
 given
 it's


the
 information,
 but
 we'll
 see
 if
 this


is
 true.
 Deepseek
 reportedly
 tapped


chips
 installed
 into
 data
 centers
 in


various
 countries,
 then
 dismantled
 those


chips
 and
 shipped
 them
 to
 China.


You
 know,
 it's
 not
 unbelievable
 that


that
 happened
 because
 like
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day,
 it's
 China.
 Like
 they
 find
 a


way
 to
 smuggle
 plenty
 of
 things
 into
 the


country.
 If
 they
 actually
 did
 train
 on


Blackwell
 and
 this
 this this
 is
 true,


which
 like
 maybe
 it
 is
 true.
 I
 think


it's
 another
 reason
 why
 we
 should
 just


be
 able
 to
 sell
 chips
 into
 China.
 I


mean,
 like
 if
 they're
 going
 to
 get
 it


anyway,
 like
 we
 might
 as
 well
 get
 paid


for
 it.
 If
 they're
 going
 to
 go
 through


all
 the
 trouble
 of
 smuggling
 it,
 like


like
 what
 the
 US
 is
 going
 to
 crack
 down


on
 these
 chips
 and
 somehow
 stop
 Deep


Seek
 from
 coming
 out
 with
 a
 new
 model.


It's
 like
 no,
 you're
 just
 never
 going
 to


fully
 get
 rid
 of
 that.
 At
 some
 point,


you
 might
 as
 well
 just
 regulate
 it
 if


they're
 finding
 a
 way
 to
 to
 navigate.
 I


think
 that's,
 you
 know,
 Jensen
 probably


feels
 this.
 He
 doesn't
 want
 to
 say
 it.


But
 Jensen
 also
 is
 probably
 like,
 "Dude,


like
 Singapore,
 Malaysia,
 they're


they're
 not
 the
 they're
 not
 necessarily


enemies
 with
 China.
 They
 might
 find
 a


way
 to
 smuggle
 those
 ships
 into
 the


region."
 And
 at
 that
 point,
 we
 might
 as


well
 just
 sell
 it.
 So,
 I
 don't know.


We're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see.
 I
 mean,


obviously,
 the
 threats
 of
 national


security
 are
 there,
 but
 like
 if
 we're


giving
 them
 the
 H200
 and
 we're
 keeping


the
 Blackwell,
 it's
 not
 like
 we're


protecting
 national
 security.
 Like,
 yes,


we're
 keeping
 a
 better
 chip
 than
 the


Chinese,
 but
 the
 H200
 is
 still
 a
 pretty


damn
 good
 chip.
 I
 mean,
 it
 led
 to
 the


first
 iterations
 of
 Chatt.
 So,
 it's
 not


like
 we're
 cutting
 off
 China
 cold
 turkey


from
 AI.
 Like,
 we're
 giving
 them
 AI


infrastructure.
 We're
 just
 trying
 to


seem
 like
 we're
 better
 by
 not
 giving


them
 the
 best
 infrastructure.
 But,
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 they're
 getting


these
 models
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 be


able
 to
 build
 on
 top
 of
 it.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 the
 AI
 war
 is
 going
 to


come
 down
 to
 uh
 the
 quality
 of
 chips
 and


quality
 of
 intelligence
 versus
 just
 the


ability
 to
 implement
 that
 intelligence


at
 scale.
 Speaking
 of
 the
 department
 or


speaking
 of
 war,
 we
 have
 the
 department


of
 war.
 Uh
 you
 had
 your
 boy
 Pete
 Haggset


come
 out
 yesterday
 and
 once
 again
 show


that
 they
 are
 seriously
 embracing
 AI.


The
 future
 of
 American
 warfare
 is
 here


and
 it's
 spelled
 AI.
 As
 technologies


advance,
 so
 do
 our
 adversaries.
 But
 here


at
 the
 War
 Department,
 we
 are
 not


sitting
 idly
 by.
 Under
 the
 leadership
 of


President
 Trump,
 America
 will
 lead
 the


charge
 on
 this
 technological


transformation
 by
 revolutionizing
 the


way
 we
 win.
 And
 that's
 why
 today
 we
 are


unleashing
 Genai.


Mill.

 platform

 the

most
 powerful

 documents,


and
 even
 analyze
 video
 or
 imagery
 at


unprecedented
 speed.
 Building
 on
 the


great
 work
 of
 Under
 Secretary
 Emil


Michael
 and
 his
 team,
 we
 will
 continue


to
 aggressively
 field
 the
 world's
 best


technology
 to
 make
 our
 fighting
 force


more
 lethal
 than
 ever
 before.
 And
 all
 of


it
 is
 Americanmade.


The
 possibilities
 with
 AI
 are
 endless.


Now,
 let's
 get
 to
 work.


>> The
 whether
 you
 like
 them
 or
 not,
 this


administration
 is
 seriously,
 seriously


embracing
 AI,
 and
 that
 is
 good
 for
 all


of
 us
 that
 are
 investing
 in
 these
 AI


companies.
 Again,
 GE
 Verova
 CEO
 says,


"We're
 investing
 in
 robotics
 and
 AI,


expanding
 productivity."
 They
 announced


a
 $10
 billion
 buyback
 up
 from
 six


billion,
 increased
 their
 dividend.


That's
 why
 GE
 Veranova
 is
 up
 10%
 in
 the


pre-market
 and
 that
 stock
 is
 getting


some
 momentum.
 Microsoft
 said
 they
 were


going
 to
 spend
 17
 billion
 over
 the
 next


two
 years
 or
 I
 think
 four
 years
 in
 India


on
 AI
 infrastructure.
 Amazon
 this


morning
 35
 billion
 in
 India
 over
 the


next
 five
 years.
 Amazon
 said
 it's
 a


latest
 investment.
 We'll
 focus
 on


business
 expansion,
 AI
 capabilities,


export
 growth
 and
 job
 creation
 inside


the
 region.
 So
 you've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 these


tech
 companies
 once
 again
 saying
 that


they're
 going to
 invest
 more
 money
 into


India
 and
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 that


ultimately
 is
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 fuel


what
 we're
 seeing
 in
 the
 overall
 AI


capex
 ecosystem.
 All right,
 here's
 the


headline
 from
 yesterday
 that
 really
 got


people
 talking.
 Elon
 Musk
 SpaceX


reportedly
 preparing
 for
 an
 IPO
 worth


1.5
 trillion
 next
 year.
 Put
 in
 the
 chat


if
 you
 think
 this
 is
 actually
 going
 to


happen.
 Elon
 hasn't
 denied
 it
 yet.
 Um


I'm
 taking
 the
 under
 on
 this.
 1.5


trillion
 is
 a
 pretty
 big
 number.
 I
 don't


think
 that
 happens
 next
 year.
 I
 could


understand
 how
 it
 could
 happen
 next
 year


if
 Elon
 thinks
 the
 market's
 hot
 and
 it's


time
 to
 go
 public,
 but
 he's
 also
 talked


so
 many
 times
 about
 being
 happy
 with


SpaceX
 being
 private
 because
 he
 doesn't


have
 to
 deal
 with
 the
 quarterly
 earnings


call.
 Uh
 being
 public
 would
 be
 a
 whole


different
 challenge.
 However,
 if
 the


whole
 AI
 space
 data
 center
 argument


continues
 to
 become
 stronger,
 Elon
 did


repost
 something
 yesterday,
 quoting
 uh


Sundar
 talking
 about
 uh
 space
 data


centers.
 I
 mean,
 you're
 probably
 going


to
 need
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 to
 make
 that


happen.
 And
 you
 know,
 the
 only
 way
 to


get
 that
 type
 of
 money,
 I
 mean,
 you


probably
 could
 get
 into
 the
 private


markets,
 but
 Elon's
 going
 to
 be
 I
 mean,


just
 any
 company
 would
 be
 more
 likely
 to


tap
 the
 the
 public
 markets
 versus
 the


private
 markets
 because
 you're
 going
 to


need
 a
 lot
 more
 liquidity
 to
 make
 it


conducive
 for
 shareholders,
 right?
 It's


hard
 to
 raise
 like
 $80
 billion
 in
 the


private
 markets
 at
 these
 valuations,


which
 means
 you
 would
 need
 a
 a
 pretty


aggressive
 IPO.
 This
 would
 be
 the


largest
 IPO
 in
 human
 history
 if
 it
 does


happen.


And
 I'm
 taking
 the
 under
 on
 it,
 but
 if


it
 does,
 Rocket
 Lab
 is
 going to
 catch
 a


massive
 bid
 next
 year
 because
 Rocket
 Lab


is
 going to
 be
 seen
 as
 just
 like
 a


sympathy
 play
 if
 you
 don't
 own
 SpaceX.


Uh
 Elon
 did
 do
 a
 new
 podcast
 yesterday.


These
 were
 a
 couple
 clips
 from
 the


podcast.
 Here
 was
 him
 talking
 about
 if


he
 would
 have
 actually
 done
 Doge
 again,


knowing
 what
 he
 knows
 now
 about
 the


government.


Would
 you
 do
 Doge
 again
 knowing
 what
 you


know
 now?


>> I
 mean
 the
 thing
 is
 like
 I
 think
 in


instead
 of
 doing
 Doge
 I
 I
 would
 have


basically
 built


you
 know
 worked
 on
 my
 companies


essentially.
 So
 and
 not
 and
 the
 cars


would
 they
 wouldn't
 have
 been
 burning


the
 cars.
 Um


>> you
 gave
 up
 a
 lot
 to
 do.
 Uh
 yeah,


like
 if
 you
 if
 you
 if
 you
 stop
 money


going
 uh
 to


uh


going going
 for
 political
 corruption,


they
 will
 they
 will
 lash
 out
 big
 time.


>> Mhm.


>> Um


so
 they
 really
 want
 the
 money
 to
 keep


blowing.
 Um,


so
 if
 you
 stop
 it
 from
 flowing,
 there's


like
 a
 very
 strong
 reaction
 to
 to


stopping
 the
 money
 flowing.


>> After
 you
 were
 in
 DC
 for
 a
 while,
 did


you
 become
 disillusioned
 with
 how
 it


operates?


>> Well,
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 I
 was
 super


illusioned
 to
 begin
 with.
 Uh,
 it
 it
 I


mean,
 I
 guess
 it's
 just
 like
 you
 really


want
 the
 least
 amount
 done
 by
 government


possible.


So,
 you
 got
 Elon
 explicitly
 saying
 he


regrets
 his
 time
 at
 Doge.
 Uh,
 and
 again,


I
 was
 a
 support
 of
 Doge.
 I
 thought
 it


had
 a
 real
 chance
 to
 do
 well,
 but


ultimately
 you're
 seeing
 Elon
 realize


that
 it's
 just
 really
 hard
 to
 deal
 with


corruption
 in
 the
 government.
 So,
 uh,


that
 was
 a
 pretty
 good
 podcast
 for
 Elon


last
 night.
 Had
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


things
 that
 he
 talked
 about
 and
 one
 of


those
 things
 was
 Doge.
 This
 was
 the
 clip


that
 was
 going
 viral
 yesterday.
 I'm


going
 to
 play
 a
 minute
 50
 of
 this
 around


Gavin
 Baker
 who's
 a
 tech
 investor


talking
 about
 data
 centers
 in
 space


getting
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 to
 think
 this
 is


why
 SpaceX
 wants
 to
 go
 public.


>> Well,
 it's
 funny.
 In
 the
 data
 center,


the
 racks
 are
 over
 a
 certain
 distance


connected
 with
 fiber
 optics
 and
 that


just
 means
 a
 laser
 going
 through
 a


cable.
 The
 only
 thing
 faster
 than
 a


laser
 going
 through
 a
 fiber
 optic
 cable


is
 a
 laser
 going
 through
 absolute


vacuum.
 So
 if
 you
 can
 link
 these


satellites
 in
 space
 together
 using


lasers,
 you
 actually
 have
 a
 faster
 and


more
 coherent
 network
 than
 in
 a
 data


center
 on
 Earth.
 Okay,
 for
 training


that's
 going
 to
 take
 a
 long
 time.
 Yeah,


just
 because
 it's
 so
 big.
 But
 for


inference,
 let's
 think
 about
 the
 user


experience.
 You
 know,
 when
 I
 asked
 Gro


about
 you
 and
 it
 gave
 the
 nice
 answer,


here's
 what
 happened.
 A
 radio
 wave


traveled
 from
 my
 cell
 phone
 to
 a
 cell


tower.
 Then
 it
 hit
 the
 base
 station,


went
 into
 a
 fiber
 optic
 cable,
 went
 to


some
 sort
 of
 metro
 aggregation
 facility


in
 New
 York,
 right
 within
 like,
 you


know,
 10
 blocks
 of
 here.
 There's
 a
 small


little
 metro
 router
 that's
 routed
 those


packets
 to
 a
 big
 XAI
 data
 center


somewhere.
 Okay.
 And
 then
 the


computation
 was
 done
 and
 it
 came
 back


over
 the
 same
 path.
 If
 the
 satellites


can
 communicate
 directly
 with
 the
 phone


and
 Starlink
 has
 demonstrated
 direct
 to


cell
 capability,
 you
 just
 go
 boom
 boom.


It's
 a
 much
 better
 lowerc
 cost
 user


experience.
 So
 in
 every
 way,
 data


centers
 in
 space
 from
 a
 first
 principles


perspective
 are
 superior
 to
 data
 centers


on
 Earth.


Look,
 I
 don't
 know
 enough
 about
 data


centers
 in
 space.
 You
 got
 a
 lot
 of


questions
 in
 the
 chat.
 How
 do
 you


maintain
 all
 the
 equipment
 from
 data


centers
 in
 space?
 What's
 the
 max
 amount


of
 watts
 a
 solar
 panel
 can
 absorb?
 I


don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 have
 the
 answer
 to


these
 questions.
 All
 I
 know
 is
 if
 Sundar


and
 Elon
 and
 Bezos
 start
 seriously


thinking
 about
 this,
 I
 mean,
 who
 knows?


Maybe
 this
 becomes
 a
 growth
 spurt
 that


gets
 the
 street
 a
 bit
 more
 excited
 about


what
 could
 happen.
 And,
 you
 know,
 maybe


that
 definitely
 catches
 a
 bit
 for
 Rock


Lab.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see,
 but


that
 is
 one
 of the
 things
 that's


definitely
 very
 important.


and
 potentially
 could
 create
 a
 bid
 for


the
 entire
 space
 industry
 long
 term.
 Uh,


Nvidia
 just
 responded
 to
 that
 deepseek


information
 article.
 They
 said,
 "We


haven't
 received
 tip.
 We
 haven't


received
 tips
 of
 phantom
 data
 centers


and
 the
 smuggling
 see
 seems


far-fetched."
 Nvidia
 says,
 "We
 haven't


received
 tips
 of
 phantom
 data
 centers


and
 smuggling
 concerns
 seem


far-fetched."


Nvidia
 right
 there.
 I
 mean,
 you
 never


know.
 Maybe
 Nvidia
 goes
 red
 today
 just


based
 on
 these
 smuggling
 accusations
 of


China
 getting
 blackwell
 because
 Trump's


probably
 not
 gonna
 be
 happy
 about
 that.


But
 Nvidia
 trying
 to
 break
 through
 185


as
 we
 have
 a
 minute
 until
 the
 market


opens.
 All
 right.
 So,
 in
 about
 4
 hours,


we
 will
 have
 the
 FOMC
 meeting
 again.


I'll
 be
 live
 at
 2:20.
 I
 think
 we're


going to
 have
 the
 head
 of
 Palunteer's


energy
 division,
 Matt
 Babin,
 also
 join


the
 show
 at
 around
 10:45.
 So,
 we'll
 get


to
 hear
 from
 him
 on
 this
 ship
 building


contract,
 450
 million
 over
 the
 past
 two


years
 that
 pounder
 got
 last
 night.
 We're


going
 to
 see
 what
 happens
 with
 the
 FOMC.


JPAL
 hopefully
 getting
 ready
 to
 give
 us


this
 rate
 cut.
 I
 think
 the
 biggest


question
 is
 not
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 get


this
 rate
 cut
 or
 not,
 even
 though
 there


is
 a
 10%
 chance
 that
 we
 don't
 get
 it,


but
 rather
 is
 it
 priced
 in?
 And
 it's


probably
 priced
 in.
 So
 then
 the
 question


is
 how
 does
 the
 market
 interpret
 it?
 Has


the
 credit
 market
 interpret
 it?
 You


know,
 we're
 getting
 awfully
 close


towards
 the
 end
 of
 December.
 What
 does


that
 mean
 for
 sort
 of
 the
 end
 of
 year


momentum
 that
 could
 be
 happening
 or
 not


happening?
 And
 so
 today,
 we're
 going
 to


hopefully
 get
 some
 answers
 to
 a
 lot
 of


those
 questions
 and
 see
 how
 the
 market


goes
 from
 there.


All
 right,
 Wednesday,
 December
 10th.


Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 It


is
 9:30
 a.m.
 and
 once
 again,
 the
 stock


market


is
 now
 open.
 [music]


[music]


All
 right,
 wake
 your
 ass
 up.
 Let's
 get


into
 it.
 Nvidia
 actually
 opens
 green


here.
 A
 lot
 of
 the
 market
 immediately


goes
 red,
 including
 JP
 Morgan
 that
 had
 a


nasty
 5%
 decline
 yesterday.
 185
 on


Nvidia
 trying
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 that
 screen.


Netflix
 goes
 red.
 Rockab,
 no
 surprise


that
 one's
 going
 red.
 That
 had
 a
 big


move
 yesterday,
 but
 that
 one's
 down


about
 1%.
 Hoodie
 1.2%.
 That's
 down
 SoFi.


Goodness
 gracious.
 2667.
 This
 one
 cannot


catch
 a
 break.
 But
 that
 one's
 down.
 2669


down
 about
 6%
 on
 the
 day.
 Meta
 down
 half


a
 percent.
 Microsoft
 down
 a
 full
 2%.
 I


did
 not
 see
 the
 headline
 on
 Meta.
 If


anyone
 has
 it,
 let
 me
 know.
 But
 I
 don't


see
 anything
 crazy
 on
 Meta.
 Amcor,
 wow.


4559.


My
 goodness.
 This
 one
 not
 stopping.
 Look


at
 that.
 Even
 holding
 the
 40s,
 I
 think


is
 incredible.
 Amcore
 right
 there.
 4534.


That's
 up
 about
 1.54%
 on
 the
 day.
 Reddit


237


almost
 pushing
 240.
 Rubric
 92
 they
 had
 a


great
 earnings.
 Adobe
 that's
 flat.
 IQ


that's
 down
 about
 3%.
 Hims
 him
 is


expanding
 to
 the
 UK
 as
 per
 a
 press


release
 this
 morning.
 That
 stock
 down


about
 1.7%.
 Oracle
 they
 have
 earnings


today
 after
 the
 bell.
 We'll
 be
 live


covering
 a
 crowd
 strike
 at
 514.
 Tesla


445.
 Warner
 Brothers
 up
 almost
 3%.


Looks
 like
 the
 street's
 thinking
 this


deal
 is
 going
 to
 get
 done.
 The
 more
 that


gets
 closer
 to
 $30,
 the
 more
 the
 street


thinks
 that
 someone
 is
 getting
 this


deal.
 2906,
 that's
 up
 2.81%
 on
 the
 day.


Uh,
 Fix
 Comfort
 Systems,
 they
 just
 got


into
 the
 S&P
 500.
 That's
 up
 another


1.4%.
 Aries
 Management
 also
 got
 into
 the


S&P
 500.
 That's
 up
 a
 little bit
 on
 the


day.
 Snowflake
 still
 getting
 hit
 after


those
 earnings.
 I
 don't
 understand
 why


Snowflake
 took
 that
 big
 of
 a
 decline,


but
 they
 did.
 That's
 down
 about
 1.3%.


Oaklo's
 down
 3%.
 Costco's
 up
 a
 little


bit.
 Bloom
 Energy
 down
 3.4%.
 Costco's


earnings
 tomorrow.
 MP
 Materials
 down


1.6.
 Rivian
 down.37.
 Where
 is
 Palenteer?


We
 are
 at
 184
 up
 about
 1.28%
 on
 the
 day.


Wow.
 Photonics
 37%.
 My
 goodness.
 This
 is


a
 small
 company.
 You
 know,
 it's
 only
 a


$2
 billion
 market
 cap.
 It
 was
 less
 than


two
 billion
 this
 morning.


So,
 I
 mean,
 if
 anyone
 got
 into
 this
 one


40%
 on
 the
 day,
 absolutely
 incredible.


That
 one
 is
 going
 green.
 Nvidia
 still


holding
 185.
 Netflix
 at
 9667.
 Amcor
 is


trying
 to
 go
 for
 46.
 Pounder
 at
 184.


Microsoft
 at
 481.
 So
 2665,
 Robin
 Hood


13452,
 AS
 probably
 down
 with
 Rocket
 Lab.


AS


about
 67%.
 BMR,
 are
 we
 getting
 a
 move?


We're
 down.
 That's
 likely
 because
 ETH
 is


well,
 ETH
 is
 flat.


Nothing
 too
 crazy
 on
 ETH.
 BMR
 taking
 a


hit
 by
 1%.
 Meta
 also
 taking
 a
 hit
 by
 1%.


Not
 sure
 why
 that
 one's
 getting
 hit,
 but


it
 is
 getting
 hit.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 I
 guess


that
 Bloomberg
 article
 highlighted
 some


internal
 issues
 with
 Meta
 around
 their


AI
 initiatives,
 and
 that
 could
 be
 an


issue.
 S&P
 682
 were
 read.
 Uh,
 TD
 Cohen


names
 Amazon
 their
 top
 mega
 cap
 internet


pick
 with
 a
 $300
 target.
 You've
 got


pretty
 much
 every
 firm
 now
 saying
 Amazon


or
 sorry,
 Amazon,
 not
 Meta,
 uh,
 285
 to


300
 across
 the
 board.
 They
 reaffirmed


their
 buy
 rating,
 $300,
 top
 pick
 for


226,
 229
 on
 Amazon.
 That's
 up
 a
 little


bit
 on
 the
 day.
 Apple
 280
 277.
 We
 were


at
 287
 last
 week.
 That
 one
 trying
 to
 get


back
 to
 that
 280
 level.
 Robin
 right


there
 at
 13425.
 S&P
 is
 682.
 The
 Q's
 are


also
 slightly
 red.
 623


down
 about
 23%


on
 the
 day.
 Again,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


price
 action
 is
 likely
 not
 going
 to
 be


significant
 until
 we
 get
 uh
 JPAL.
 So,


you
 know,
 if
 you're
 trading
 this,
 you


you
 know,
 you
 could
 be
 trading
 it,
 but
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 volume
 up
 or
 down
 is


going
 to
 happen
 once
 shape
 delivers
 his


decision
 and
 more
 importantly
 how
 he


talks
 about
 that
 decision.
 Marll,
 that's


up
 3%
 on
 the
 day.
 American
 Express


reports
 US
 consumer
 retail
 spending


increased
 by
 9%
 in
 parts
 of
 November.


We've
 been
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 good
 news


around
 Black
 Friday,
 Cyber
 Monday,
 and


the
 overall
 US
 consumer,
 which
 is
 really


I
 mean,
 Lululemon
 is
 on
 Thursday,
 which


is
 tomorrow.
 If
 Lulu
 crushes,
 I
 think


you've
 got
 a
 a
 decent
 challenge
 to
 the


consumer's
 weak
 narrative.
 Lulu,
 right,


they're
 up
 about
 1%.
 Because
 pretty
 much


every
 other
 company
 in
 the
 retailer


space,
 whether
 it's
 Best
 Buy,


Burlington,
 Abbercrombie,
 Urban


Outfitters,
 etc.
 Five
 below,
 which
 is


like
 a
 dollar
 store
 type
 of
 company.
 The


fact
 that
 they
 crushed
 earnings
 by
 25%.


Like
 that
 it's
 just
 it
 really
 is


challenging
 this
 consumer
 week


narrative.
 And
 so
 we're
 going
 to
 see


what
 Lulu
 does
 tomorrow.
 Ethereum
 right


there
 3,300
 holding
 on
 to
 that
 level.


Tesla
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 to
 450.
 Warner


Bros.
 keeps
 going.


Maybe
 the
 street
 really
 thinks
 this
 deal


is
 happening.
 Question
 is,
 who
 do
 they


think
 is
 going
 to
 be
 paying
 for
 this


deal?
 2912,
 that's
 up
 3.03%


[snorts]


on
 the
 day
 for
 Warner
 Brothers.
 Did


anyone
 buy
 Warner
 Bros.
 at
 like
 26
 27


just
 for
 the
 arbitrage?
 I
 was
 thinking


of
 it,
 but
 it's
 also
 the
 risk
 of
 like


the
 deal
 getting
 blocked
 completely
 and


then
 the
 stock
 gets
 cut
 in
 half
 because


there's
 no
 reason
 it
 would
 be
 trading
 at


$27
 if
 it
 wasn't
 for
 this
 buyout
 offer.


But
 that
 one's
 getting
 hit.
 AMD
 right


there,
 219.
 You
 do
 have
 a
 headline
 on


AMD
 and
 Intel.
 Intel
 and
 AMD
 accused
 of


failing
 to
 block
 chips
 in
 Russia


missiles.


Um,


okay.
 That
 could
 be
 affecting


Intel
 and
 AMD
 if
 their
 chips
 are
 being


seen
 in
 Russian
 missiles.
 Not
 sure
 if


that's
 correct,
 but
 that
 is
 the


headline.
 Intel
 down
 about
 3.3%
 right


there.
 GameStop,
 not
 the
 best
 earnings.


They
 um
 they
 beat
 on
 EPS.
 They
 missed
 on


revenue
 down
 5%.


So
 again,
 GameStop
 is
 in
 their


rebuilding
 phase
 and
 they've
 been


rebuilding
 for
 a
 while,
 but


might
 continue
 to
 take
 some
 more
 time.


[sighs]


Um,


GameStop
 around
 21
 is
 good
 buy.
 You


know,
 they
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 cash.
 They
 have


a
 lot
 of
 cash.
 Question
 is,
 you
 know,


does
 the
 cash
 keep
 them
 afloat
 at
 these


levels?
 I
 got
 to
 go
 deeper
 in
 their


earnings.
 I
 do
 think
 the
 trading
 card


business
 has
 some
 potential,
 but


ultimately
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see,


you
 know,
 if
 that's
 what
 you
 want
 to
 bet


on
 for
 this
 one.
 Wow.
 Amcore
 46,
 dude.


Stock
 talk
 and
 I
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 when


we
 were
 discussing
 Amore
 30,
 he
 really


did
 not
 expect
 45
 to
 50
 until
 mid
 2026.


You
 know,
 he
 was
 optimistic,
 but
 he
 felt


it
 was
 going
 to
 take
 some
 time
 for
 this


thing
 would
 really
 play
 out.
 This
 one
 in


the
 past
 three
 weeks
 has
 played
 out.
 So,


if
 anyone
 sells
 here,
 I
 can't
 blame
 you.


I'm
 holding
 out
 for
 50
 before
 I
 start


trimming.
 Um,
 which,
 you
 know,
 I
 think


now
 that
 the
 company's
 being
 rerated,


now
 you're
 getting
 a
 lot
 more
 American


onore
 manufacturing
 uh,
 sentiment
 go


positive.
 I
 think
 50
 is
 not
 that
 crazy.


Obviously,
 the
 stock
 getting
 much
 closer


to
 50
 also
 helps.
 But
 it
 does
 seem
 like


50
 is
 not
 crazy.
 But
 if
 you
 want
 to
 take


some
 profits,
 if
 you
 bought
 at
 30
 at
 45,


that's
 not
 horrible.
 I
 know
 he
 has
 sold


some
 of
 his
 leaps
 that
 he
 has
 or
 not


leaps
 but
 like
 I
 think
 he
 has
 like


February
 calls
 on
 this


but
 maybe
 50
 is
 in
 the
 play
 going
 into


2026.
 Meta
 right
 there
 648
 Meta
 is
 still


getting
 a
 hit
 that's
 down
 about
 1.35%.


But
 again
 it's
 yeah
 it's
 weird
 that


Amcor
 is
 pumping
 again
 like
 a
 lot
 of


these
 names
 that
 are
 pumping
 the
 only


reason
 they're
 pumping
 is
 or
 the
 only


reason
 they're
 alive
 is
 because
 of


Nvidia.
 Like
 Amcor
 is
 helping
 packaging


for
 semiconductors
 and
 manufacturing


inside
 of
 a
 fab
 in
 Arizona
 for
 TSMC.


TSMC's
 demand
 is
 I
 mean
 they
 have
 a
 lot


of
 different
 customers
 but
 Nvidia
 is
 a


big
 part
 of
 it.
 By
 the
 way,
 I
 think


their
 t
 the
 TSM
 monthly
 metrics
 came
 out


yesterday
 and
 it
 was
 like
 67
 billion


last
 month
 like
 just
 incredible


incredible
 growth.
 But
 it
 is
 very
 weird


that
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 are
 making
 a


move
 and
 Nvidia
 is
 not
 the
 name
 making
 a


move
 even
 though
 it's
 part
 of
 it.
 Amazon


above
 230.
 That
 is
 nice
 to
 see.
 I
 agree


with
 TD
 Cohen
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 other


firms.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 really
 strong


pick
 going
 into
 2026.
 I
 don't
 think
 I


don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 think
 Amazon


disappoints
 in
 2026.
 It's
 It's
 probably


going
 to
 end
 the
 year
 unless
 we
 get,
 you


know,
 a
 really
 big
 move
 over
 the
 next


coming
 weeks
 relatively
 flat.
 Maybe
 you


get
 five
 to
 7%
 out
 of
 it.
 Maybe
 if
 it


really
 breaks
 out
 to
 260,
 you
 get
 that


10%
 move.
 But
 if
 not,
 it's
 going
 to


definitely
 underperform
 the
 S&P
 500.
 two


years
 in
 a
 row
 of
 underperforming
 the


S&P
 500
 with
 all
 the
 margin
 margin


efficiencies
 and
 productivity
 gains
 on


Amazon.
 I
 feel
 like
 it's
 unlikely.
 So,


we're
 going
 to
 see
 what
 happens
 with


Amazon,
 but
 that
 one
 getting
 a
 nice
 2%


move
 right
 there.
 23150


as
 that
 one
 is
 up.
 Yes,
 we
 saw
 SoFi's
 5%


cashback
 offer.
 Decent
 offer.
 Stocks
 not


really
 reflecting
 it
 right
 now.
 Again,
 I


think
 SoFi
 is
 a
 buy
 here.
 I
 think
 NTO


had
 I
 I
 think
 Nto
 has
 some
 plan
 with
 the


dilution
 and
 maybe
 I'm
 too
 naive
 for


trusting
 his
 uh
 intuition,
 but
 I
 don't


know
 if
 you
 raise
 1.5
 billion
 and
 just


let
 the
 stock
 falter.
 I
 think
 they're


going
 to
 do
 something
 with
 the
 money.


The
 question
 is,
 is
 it
 more
 loan


originations?
 Is
 it
 an
 acquisition?
 No


one
 knows,
 but
 hopefully
 in
 the
 coming


days
 we
 get
 a
 lot
 more
 information
 on


that.
 Amcor
 still
 moving
 4645,
 that's
 up


4%
 on
 the
 day.
 Nvidia
 184,
 S&P
 500,
 682,


BMR,
 that's
 down
 about
 1.3.
 and
 pound


share.
 There
 you
 go.
 Getting
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 boost
 right
 there.
 187
 now.
 Did


hit
 193
 after
 hours
 yesterday


um
 off
 of
 that
 $450
 million
 contract


with
 the
 US
 Navy
 for
 two
 years.


And
 that
 was
 getting
 some
 more


excitement.
 Rocket
 Lab,
 are
 we
 green?
 We


are
 not
 green,
 but
 we're
 still
 holding


53


on
 Rocket
 Lab.
 [snorts]


Is
 Oracle
 a
 buy
 before
 earnings?
 Put
 in


the
 chat
 if
 you
 think
 so.


I
 feel
 like
 if
 you
 are
 fully
 okay
 with


bag
 holding,
 which
 means
 you
 cannot
 cry


if
 this
 thing
 dumps
 below
 200,
 then
 yes.


But
 the
 risk
 of
 it
 dumping
 below
 200,
 if


they
 say
 anything
 around
 their
 debt


financing,
 around
 their
 lack
 of
 RPO


growth
 outside
 of
 OpenAI,
 I
 think
 you


take
 her
 down.
 So,
 I
 will
 not
 be
 buying


before
 earnings.
 I
 did
 think
 of
 it,
 but


granted,
 last
 time
 I
 didn't
 buy
 before


earnings
 and
 it
 pumped
 to
 350,
 but
 last


time
 they
 didn't
 have
 $40
 billion
 in


debt
 and
 they
 actually
 had
 positive
 free


cash
 flow.
 for
 the
 next
 five
 years
 they


will
 have
 negative
 free
 cash
 flow


because
 of
 all
 the
 debt
 and
 so
 obviously


you
 know
 things
 have
 changed
 especially


given
 their
 credit
 default
 swaps
 have


also
 gone
 to
 the
 moon
 so
 I
 think
 I
 think


Oracle
 can
 really
 beat
 and
 raise
 and


surprise
 the
 stock
 is
 higher
 but
 I
 think


the
 risk-to-reward
 might
 not
 be
 the
 best


right
 here
 Amazon
 231
 Nvidia
 still
 red


just
 below
 185


but
 she
 is
 trying
 GEV
 massive
 massive


move
 on
 GEV
 if
 you
 opponent.
 Congrats.


Wow.
 718


15%
 move.
 This
 stock
 is
 now
 up,
 I


believe,
 85%
 for
 the
 year.
 Never
 mind.


112%
 for
 the
 year.
 Talk
 about
 a
 bull


market,
 bro.


Talk
 about
 a
 bull
 market.
 $200
 billion


company
 was
 a
 hundred
 billion,
 less
 than


100
 billion
 in
 January.


I
 mean,
 imagine
 just
 being
 heavily
 over


overweight.
 GEV.
 That
 was
 your
 year.
 you


didn't
 have
 to
 do
 anything.
 You
 didn't


have
 to
 worry
 about
 the
 day-to-day.
 You


didn't
 have
 to
 like
 you
 just
 had
 to


heavily
 allocate


to
 one
 name.
 Ended
 up
 working
 out.


[snorts]
 And
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 names
 like


this.
 That's
 the
 beauty
 of
 a
 bull


market.
 There's
 a
 and
 and
 this
 is


happening
 for
 a
 reason.
 Like
 it's
 not


meme
 stock
 mania
 with
 GE.
 Like
 they


increase
 the
 dividend,
 they
 increase
 the


buyback
 by
 60%.
 I
 mean
 like
 yeah,
 you


can
 get
 the
 street
 that
 gets
 very


excited
 when
 a
 company
 does
 shareholder


friendly
 things
 like
 that.
 Apple
 right


there
 at
 277,
 S&P
 at
 682,
 pounder
 still


holding
 186.
 Weeble
 back
 above
 10
 or
 at


least
 it
 touched
 $10
 for
 the
 first
 time


in
 a
 couple
 weeks.
 Google
 at
 316.
 I
 see


Google
 making
 that
 move
 back
 into
 the
 uh


mid3s.
 Apploving
 at
 714.
 This
 was
 up


from
 525.
 Had
 a
 great
 opportunity
 a


couple
 weeks
 ago.
 Grab
 at
 512.
 PayPal
 at


60.
 Zeta
 at
 19.
 That
 one
 holding
 on
 to


that
 level.
 Service
 now
 at
 846.
 And
 then


New
 Bank
 [snorts]


at
 1656.
 Netflix
 are
 we
 still
 red?
 Wow.


9568.
 We
 are
 still
 red
 on
 Netflix.


Iroot
 still
 up
 31%.


Are
 they
 getting
 acquired
 or
 something?


Why
 does
 this
 thing
 pump
 every
 other


day?


And
 if
 they're
 getting
 acquired,
 is
 this


pump
 just
 based
 on
 the
 rumor


of
 this
 happening?
 It's
 like
 almost


every
 other
 day
 you
 get
 this
 move,
 but


then
 you
 get
 a
 downside
 move
 as
 well.


Navius,
 she's
 taking
 a
 dump.
 That's
 down


2.3.
 It
 was
 Coreweave,
 which
 touched
 90


yesterday
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 a
 couple


weeks.
 Cororeweave
 also
 taken
 a
 dump


down
 5%.
 Iran
 has
 also
 taken
 a
 dump
 down


3%.


The
 data
 center
 names
 they
 move
 with


each
 other.


They
 have
 zero
 level
 of
 uh
 of


sovereignty.


One
 of
 them
 goes
 down,
 the
 others
 are


like,
 "All
 right,
 we're
 coming
 with


you."
 They're
 very
 unified
 in
 that


respect.
 Amcor,
 she's
 trying
 to
 push
 47.


Trying
 to
 push
 47.
 VG


52-W
 week
 low.


Dude,
 I
 have
 not
 bought
 VG
 yet
 cuz
 I


don't
 fully
 understand
 oil
 and
 gas.
 If
 I


buy
 this
 thing,
 it's
 literally
 just


going
 to
 be
 because
 Matt
 and
 Chris
 like


really
 think
 this
 name
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


big
 winner.
 But
 again,
 their
 perspective


is
 literally
 a
 decade
 from
 now.
 I
 mean,


they've
 been
 very
 clear
 that
 this
 one's


going
 to
 take
 time.


So,
 if
 I
 buy
 it,
 it's
 just
 going
 to
 be


borrowing
 their
 conviction.
 But
 I
 do
 not


have
 a
 position
 in
 this
 one.
 I
 do
 think


stressing
 over
 the
 day-to-day
 on
 this


one
 doesn't
 make
 much
 sense
 because


again
 right
 now
 they
 have
 a
 lawsuit.


There's
 not
 really
 many
 catalysts
 and


ultimately
 the
 narrative
 of
 the
 stock
 is


not
 the
 best
 but
 it
 could
 be
 one
 of


those
 buy
 and
 holds
 for
 the
 next
 next


decade.
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 185.
 All


right.
 Nvidia
 going
 green.


Nvidia


going
 green
 right
 here.
 Uh
 I
 already
 tax


loss
 harvested
 my
 Misti.
 That
 was
 about


two
 weeks
 ago.
 I
 think
 they
 did
 a


reverse
 split
 or
 something.
 Yeah,
 3612


on
 this
 one.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 Micro


Strategy
 didn't
 work
 this
 year.
 It's


just
 that
 simple.
 Some
 of
 the
 YieldMax


ETFs
 worked
 on
 names
 that
 really
 did


have
 amazing
 runs
 like
 Hood
 and


Palenteer
 and
 Nvidia,
 but
 Micro
 Strategy


did
 not
 work
 this
 year.
 And,
 you
 know,


we've
 only
 got
 20
 days
 left
 to
 December.


I
 doubt
 I
 mean,
 maybe
 Bitcoin
 has
 a


massive
 run,
 but
 it's
 going to
 be
 tough


for
 Micro
 Strategy
 to
 work.
 So
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 people
 that
 are
 heavy
 and
 misty


for
 the
 income,
 which
 I
 mean,
 look,
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 you
 got
 to
 ask


yourself,
 is
 Micro
 Strategy
 and
 Bitcoin


going
 to
 turn
 around
 anytime
 soon?
 If
 it


doesn't,
 it
 begs
 the
 question
 of
 if
 that


income
 is
 actually
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


be
 sustainable,
 and
 that's
 down
 to
 the


market
 dynamics
 of
 Bitcoin.
 So,
 I
 think


it's
 going to
 be
 a
 broader
 question


around
 how
 Bitcoin
 plays
 out.
 91,949


on
 Biddy


on
 the
 day.
 [snorts]


Um,


Core
 Reef,
 what
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 the


data
 centers,
 dude?
 Why
 are
 they
 5%
 down


here?
 Amazon
 and
 Nvidia
 are
 up.
 Amcor
 is


up.
 Data
 centers
 are
 down.
 You
 had
 some


good
 news
 with
 Nebas
 yesterday,


acquiring
 some
 more
 land.
 You
 had
 some


good
 coreweave
 completion
 of
 uh
 of
 uh


convertible
 notes
 yesterday.
 That's
 why


that
 one
 was
 also
 5%.
 I
 think
 you
 got
 a


couple
 upgrades
 on
 I
 rent
 and
 neb
 as


well.
 Still


these
 names
 incredibly
 volatile.
 in
 the


data
 center
 space.
 Hoodie
 right
 there


134
 just
 below
 135
 and
 then
 Microsoft


why
 okay
 why
 is
 I
 don't
 I
 still
 don't


see
 a
 Microsoft
 headline
 but
 that's
 down


almost
 3%.


Tom
 Lee
 did
 say
 that
 Micro
 Strategy
 is


the
 most
 interesting
 stock
 the
 market


should
 look
 like
 but
 remember
 Tom
 Lee
 is


saying
 that
 because
 he
 thinks
 a
 lot
 of


the
 banks
 are
 shorting
 Micro
 Strategy
 to


get
 exposure
 to
 their
 hedge
 on
 Bitcoin


and
 because
 you
 know
 they
 don't
 short


Bitcoin
 itself
 they
 and
 IBIT
 doesn't


have
 the
 options
 market
 that
 Micro


Strategy
 has.
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 he's


saying
 that
 this
 one's
 a
 much
 more


interesting
 argument.


Uh
 Jeffrey
 says,
 "Microsoft
 has
 a


tactical
 opportunity.
 We
 are
 bullish
 on


Microsoft.


They're
 still
 keeping
 their
 price


target.
 I
 don't
 see
 any
 bad
 headlines."


We
 did
 have
 an
 OpenAI
 piece
 of
 headline.


OpenAI
 hired
 the
 CEO
 of
 Slack
 as
 their


next
 uh
 chief
 revenue
 officer,


which
 I
 mean


I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's
 bearish
 for


Microsoft
 given
 they
 own
 a
 lot
 of


OpenAI.
 Uh
 I
 think
 that's
 kind
 of


bullish
 for
 OpenAI.
 I
 mean
 that's
 a


pretty
 seasoned
 executive
 14
 years
 at


Salesforce
 as
 well
 to
 scale
 their


enterprise
 business.


But
 maybe
 the
 market's
 like,
 hey,
 it's


the
 CEO
 of
 Slack.
 We
 don't
 really
 think


that's
 should
 be
 the
 best
 person
 to
 lead


revenue
 for
 an
 AI
 company.
 Phototronics


47%.
 My
 goodness,
 that's
 green.


Microsoft
 down
 with
 the
 17
 billion
 of


capex.
 Yeah,
 but
 that
 that
 that
 India


news
 was
 yesterday.
 That's
 weird.


If
 it's
 getting
 hit
 on
 on
 this
 one.


Um,
 okay.
 Next
 door.
 Why
 is
 Next
 Door


pumping?
 Uh,
 your
 boy
 Eric
 Jackson,
 this


is
 his
 next
 100
 bagger.
 He's
 had
 like
 10


100
 baggers
 in
 the
 past
 month
 and
 a


half,
 which
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 hope
 to
 be


uh
 an
 amazing
 investor
 one
 day
 who
 can


hopefully
 have
 a
 legacy
 of
 decent
 picks.


But
 I
 I
 am
 not
 talented
 enough
 to
 find


10
 100
 baggers
 over
 two
 months.
 I'm
 just


I'm
 not
 that
 good.
 I
 I'll
 admit
 it.
 I


really
 am
 not
 that
 good.
 But
 uh
 he


apparently
 finds
 one
 every
 week.
 And
 so


this
 is
 his
 next
 100
 bagger,
 Next
 Door


Holdings.
 It
 is
 up
 33%
 today
 because
 of


his
 tweets
 on
 it.


And
 yeah,
 that's
 why
 you're
 getting
 your


pump.


So,
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 his
 thesis
 is


other
 than
 it's
 going
 to
 go
 up


by
 100x.


[laughter]
 So,
 that's
 what
 you
 got.
 He


says,
 "Next
 Door
 at
 $2
 today
 feels
 like


a
 stock
 that
 has
 been
 misperformed
 for
 a


year.
 It's
 the
 most
 mispriced
 agentic
 AI


platform
 of
 the
 2020s.
 What
 happened
 to


Openoor?
 Wasn't
 this
 thing
 supposed
 to


go
 to
 $82?


Open
 Door's
 down
 about
 2.8%
 720


on
 the
 day
 as
 well.
 He
 likes
 everything


with
 a
 door
 in
 it,


I
 guess.
 So,
 Nexo
 right
 there,
 that's
 up


30%
 on
 the
 day.
 Micro
 Strategy,
 that's


down
 2.4%.
 Netflix,
 that's
 down
 1.6.


And
 SoFi,


that's
 down
 half
 a
 percent.


Um,
 I
 read
 that
 Bezos
 ex-wife
 sold
 about


50
 million
 shares
 this
 year
 based
 on


that
 volume
 that
 could
 suppress
 the


price
 action
 for
 a
 long
 time
 if
 no


buyers
 to
 show.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 Bezos's


wife
 has
 been
 selling
 a
 decent
 amount.


So
 is
 Bezos,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 the


Amazon
 stuff
 is
 about
 the
 insider


selling.
 I
 really
 do
 think
 it's
 about


the
 narrative
 of
 these
 guys
 showing
 to


the
 street
 they
 can
 inflect
 operating


margins
 and
 generate
 more
 net
 income


growth
 because
 Amazon
 generates
 a
 ton
 of


revenue
 but
 obviously
 their
 margins
 are


not
 the
 best
 because
 you
 know
 they're


selling
 things
 with
 a
 5.3%
 operating


margin
 in
 their
 commerce
 business.
 Now


their
 AWS
 margin
 is
 amazing
 but
 AWS
 has


been
 slowing
 down
 over
 the
 past
 couple


years
 outside
 of
 what
 they
 said
 50
 days


ago
 which
 is
 that
 they
 are
 reacelerating


which
 you
 would
 think
 okay
 the
 stock


should
 get
 rerated.
 it
 did
 get
 rerated,


then
 it
 fell
 in
 November
 and
 then
 it


just
 hasn't
 really
 been
 able
 to
 get


back.
 Although
 it
 is
 up
 from
 like
 that


220
 range,
 so
 you
 know,
 it's
 not


completely
 in
 the
 gutter.
 Um,
 but
 I


think
 the
 robotic
 story
 on
 Amazon
 is
 the


most
 exciting
 thing.
 And
 I
 don't
 even


think
 that's
 that
 complicated
 to


understand,
 which
 is
 why
 I
 think
 2026
 it


could
 be


a
 much
 easier
 name
 to
 to
 hold
 on
 to.


Um,


APLD
 is
 down
 with
 all
 the
 other
 data


center
 names.
 Again,
 all
 of
 them
 took
 a


hit
 this
 morning.


That's
 why
 that's
 down.
 Do
 we
 have
 any


data
 this
 morning
 outside
 of
 the
 Fed


decision?


Um,
 the
 Bank
 of
 Canada
 left
 interest


rates
 unchanged.


So,
 we
 had
 that
 happen


uh
 about
 an
 hour
 ago.


Yeah,
 we're
 not
 going to
 get
 too
 much


data
 today.
 So,
 2
 PM
 will
 be
 the
 biggest


thing
 we
 see
 today.
 And
 then
 in
 a
 week,


we're
 going
 to
 get
 the
 jobs
 data
 for


November.


Uh,
 and
 then
 January,
 we
 get
 CPI
 for


December
 as
 per
 what
 the
 BLS
 said


yesterday.


So,
 we'll
 have
 more
 of
 those
 updates
 as


we
 get
 into
 January.
 ASST,
 that's
 down


about
 5%.
 D-Wave
 down
 1.3.
 Uh,
 AVAB,


they
 had
 earnings
 yesterday.
 Arrow


Environment,
 they're
 down
 10%.
 They
 did


miss
 on
 revenue.
 Not
 the
 biggest
 miss,


but
 they
 did
 miss.
 That's
 down
 about
 9


3%.
 Nike
 and
 ELF,
 these
 are
 names
 to


watch
 out
 for.
 Nike
 up
 1.6%
 6%
 if
 the


tariffs
 do
 get
 reversed,
 which
 it
 looks


like
 based
 on
 Trump's
 tweets,
 he
 is


thinking
 more
 and
 more
 that
 the
 Supreme


Court
 is
 going
 to
 reverse
 this
 stuff.


And


if
 it
 happens,


you
 know,
 those
 could
 be


sympathy
 plays
 that
 get
 the
 benefit


given
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 their
 stuff
 comes


from
 China.
 Microsoft
 right
 there
 still


down
 2%.
 Then
 Cororeweave
 down
 4.7.
 Novo


that's
 pumping
 today.
 Novo
 that's
 up


3.3.


Okay,
 that's
 green.
 Oracle's
 earnings


are
 after
 the
 bell.
 I'll
 be
 live
 with


Neil
 and
 I
 think
 Jose


and
 we'll
 see
 what
 happens
 there.


4792
 on
 Novo.


That's
 up
 about
 4.2%.


Yeah,
 I'm
 not
 sure
 why
 Cor's
 down.
 I


don't
 see
 any
 headlines
 around
 the
 data


centers
 other
 than
 they
 are
 incredibly


incredibly
 volatile.
 Silver,
 by
 the
 way,


I
 mean
 this
 thing
 is
 going
 crazy.
 So,


first
 of
 all,
 the
 price
 of
 silver,
 are


we
 still
 above
 60?
 We
 are
 still
 above


60.
 Gold
 is
 actually
 slightly
 red
 on
 the


day.
 Silver's
 up.
 I
 mean,
 again,
 the


only
 person
 I
 know
 in
 my
 life
 that
 was


screaming
 silver
 was
 my
 uncle,
 and
 I


definitely
 didn't
 take
 his
 advice.
 So,


I'm
 gonna
 I'm
 gonna
 have
 to
 hear
 a
 lot


of
 [ __ ]
 from
 him.
 Every
 time
 silver
 goes


up,
 I'm
 already
 hearing
 a
 lot
 of
 [ __ ]


but
 it
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 [laughter]


If
 your
 loved
 one
 tells
 you
 to
 buy


something
 and
 you
 say,
 "Ah,
 whatever."


And
 it
 goes
 up
 a
 lot,
 you're
 going
 to


have
 to
 hear
 some
 [ __ ]
 But,
 uh,
 take
 a


look
 at
 this.
 Physical
 silverbacked
 ETFs


posted
 a
 15
 million
 ounce
 of
 net
 inflow


in
 the
 first
 four
 days
 of
 last
 week,
 the


second
 highest
 weekly
 total
 this
 year.


Silver
 ETFs
 are
 now
 on
 track
 to
 attract


their
 10th
 monthly
 inflow
 this
 year.
 And


the
 biggest
 silver
 ETF,
 SLV
 from
 Black


Rockck,
 saw
 nearly
 a
 billion
 in
 net


inflows
 last
 week,
 exceeding
 intakes
 of


the
 largest
 gold
 fund.


So,
 the
 commodities
 trade
 is
 screaming.


Now,
 it's
 not
 necessarily
 bullish
 that


commodities
 are
 going
 up
 and
 then
 bond


yields
 are
 going
 up.
 It's
 kind
 of
 the


bond
 market
 and
 the
 commodities
 market


may
 be
 saying,
 "Hey,
 you
 know,
 we
 are


not
 necessarily
 loving
 monetary
 policy,


but
 nonetheless,
 you
 could
 also
 say
 it's


more
 of
 an
 everything
 rally
 if
 the
 AI


trade
 stays
 intact."


And
 you
 might
 be
 getting
 some
 FOMO
 into


silver,
 not
 to
 mention
 COPEX,
 which
 is


also
 uh
 the
 copper
 ETF
 for
 the
 copper


miners,
 which
 is
 doing
 well.
 I
 I
 had
 a
 a


couple
 calls
 on
 this.
 I
 sold
 this
 around


64
 and
 then
 it
 dipped
 to
 like
 58
 and
 now


it's
 back
 at
 67.
 So
 this
 thing
 is
 also


continuing
 to
 do
 well.
 That's
 up
 1.3%.


Copper,
 silver,
 and
 gold
 are
 just
 having


a
 hell
 of
 a
 year,


which
 is
 pretty
 incredible.
 My
 my


concern
 is
 that,
 you
 know,
 there's
 maybe


too
 much
 FOMO
 getting
 into
 these
 trades.


But
 then
 you
 also
 think
 about
 data


centers.
 They
 need
 a
 lot
 of
 these


commodities,
 in
 particular
 copper.
 So


it's
 not
 crazy
 to
 imagine
 that
 there's


going
 to
 be
 some
 outstanding
 demand


that's
 going
 to
 be
 sustainable
 right


there.
 Amazon
 232.
 That's
 the
 high
 of


day
 on
 Amazon


[snorts]


as
 that
 one
 continues
 to
 go
 green.


Rivian,
 are
 we
 breaking
 18
 today?
 Wow.


Rivian
 2.3.


You
 guys
 know
 Rivian
 was
 the
 largest
 IPO


in
 2021.


It's
 kind
 of
 crazy.
 Kind
 of
 crazy.
 We


let
 this
 thing
 go
 public
 at
 what
 130


billion
 or
 something?
 This
 thing
 was
 not


worth
 130
 billion.
 [laughter]


I
 mean
 18
 bucks
 though.
 That's
 up
 2.6.


six


and
 that's
 still
 going.
 Where's
 NEO?
 We


haven't
 looked
 at
 NEO
 in
 a
 minute.
 Yeah,


Caterpillar
 has
 been
 a
 great
 stock
 as


well.
 NEO's
 still
 at
 $5,
 dude.
 Neo
 was


$5
 back
 in
 2020
 when
 I
 bought
 it,
 which


is
 kind
 of
 crazy.
 Uh
 Caterpillar
 is
 one


of
 the
 best
 performing
 dividend
 stocks


this
 year.
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 of
 these


dividend
 paying
 names
 actually
 ended
 up


having
 a
 massive
 year.
 Caterpillar's
 up


67%.


You've
 got
 a
 data
 center
 correlation


with
 them
 as
 well.


Um,
 and
 you
 know,
 that
 one's
 getting


some
 love
 right
 there.
 There's
 been
 a


bunch
 of
 these
 data
 center
 names
 that


have
 like
 really
 shown
 momentum.
 So,


Caterpillar's
 up
 65%
 year-to-
 date.


That's
 a
 dividend
 stock.
 Goldman
 Sachs


up
 52%.
 That's
 a
 dividend
 stock.
 JP


Morgan
 up
 25%
 dividend
 stock.
 Dollar


General,
 dividend
 paying
 stock.
 I
 didn't


even
 know
 these
 guys
 were
 up
 67%
 year
 to


date,
 but
 they
 are
 67%.


Uh,
 and
 then
 Franco
 Nevada
 Corporation,


that's
 up
 67%.
 FNV
 that's
 up
 60
 that


that's
 a
 dividend
 paying
 stock
 and
 then


Comfort
 Systems
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 S&P


500
 is
 up
 130%.


So
 really
 this
 bull
 market
 was
 not


Nvidia
 and
 Amazon.
 Amazon
 barely
 did


anything.
 Nvidia's
 up
 30%
 which
 is
 nice.


But
 you've
 got
 dividend
 stocks
 that
 are


up
 double
 Nvidia
 for
 the
 year.
 Some
 of


them
 triple
 Nvidia


and
 you
 know
 I
 think
 it's
 more
 a
 sign
 of


a
 healthy
 bull
 market
 that
 you
 have
 a


lot
 of these
 stocks
 participating
 in
 the


momentum.
 G
 Verova
 still
 up
 13%
 right


here.


on


on
 the
 day.
 [snorts]
 Do
 you
 think
 Robin


Hood
 would
 ever
 pay
 a
 dividend?
 I
 think


eventually
 in
 the
 future
 Robin
 Hood


might
 pay
 a
 dividend,
 but
 you're
 not


buying
 Hood
 for
 the
 dividend.
 You're


buying
 Hood
 for
 the
 capital


appreciation.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 I
 would
 be


quite
 worried
 if
 they
 start
 paying
 a


dividend
 because
 they
 don't
 really
 need


to.
 And
 the
 thing
 is
 they're
 buying
 back


their
 stock,
 which
 is
 a
 pseudo
 dividend


because
 they're
 decreasing
 the
 the
 share


count
 and
 they're
 making
 sure
 that
 you


own
 more
 of
 the
 company.
 But,
 um,
 no,


they
 don't
 need
 to.
 If
 they
 keep
 growing


at
 30
 40%
 I
 mean
 that
 growth
 is
 what
 I


care
 more
 about
 and
 them
 investing
 that


capital
 versus
 them
 putting
 it
 into
 a


dividend.
 Dow's
 down
 1%.
 SMCI
 Jason


bought
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 SMCI
 yesterday


that's
 down
 2%.
 Dualingo
 that's
 down
 1.3


but
 it's
 back
 above
 200.
 Grab
 continues


to
 be
 stuck
 again.
 I
 think
 we're
 really


going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 what
 happens
 with


the
 go-to
 acquisition.
 There
 isn't
 much


news
 to
 update
 on
 Grab.
 A
 lot
 of
 people


have
 been
 asking
 for
 updates.
 There's


just
 not
 any.
 If
 there
 were,
 I
 would


cover
 it.
 Even
 Mike,
 I
 was
 talking
 with


him
 yesterday.
 You
 know,
 we
 both
 believe


that
 this
 opportunity
 is
 still
 one
 of


the
 best
 opportunities
 in
 the
 market
 and


2026
 is
 going to
 be
 a
 good
 year,


especially
 for
 from
 an
 emerging
 markets


play.
 We
 did
 a
 benchmark
 that
 reiterated


their
 $7
 target
 yesterday.
 There's
 just


not
 that
 many
 updates
 because
 I
 think


the
 street's
 waiting
 for
 this
 go-to


stuff
 to
 be
 resolved.
 So,
 Grab
 right


there
 at
 510,
 that's
 down
 about
 1%
 as


that
 one
 continues
 to
 get
 stuck.
 Google


right
 there
 at
 316,
 Uber
 at
 86.90,


that's
 down
 2.4.
 And
 then
 Warner


Brothers
 still
 moving.
 It
 is
 50
 cents


away


um
 or
 70
 cents
 away
 from
 from
 30
 3.6%


green


on
 the
 day
 right
 here.


My
 goodness,
 this
 one
 really
 the


street's
 really
 thinking
 it's
 happening.


Could
 Bill
 Aman
 be
 buying
 Meta?
 You


know,
 Bill
 Aman
 did
 say
 two
 weeks
 ago
 a


stock
 has
 finally
 got
 to
 the
 levels
 that


we've
 been
 waiting
 for
 years
 to
 buy.
 I


do
 think
 Meta
 is
 one
 of
 those
 names.
 A


lot
 of
 people
 are
 saying
 it's
 Adobe,
 but


Adobe's
 been
 read
 all
 year.
 So,
 I
 don't


think
 Aman
 would
 have
 said
 that
 if
 it


was
 Adobe.
 I
 think
 it's
 something
 that


had
 a
 knee-jerk
 reaction
 based
 on
 the


November
 leveraging
 event.


And
 I
 do
 think
 it
 is
 Meta.
 [snorts]


It's
 Netflix.
 Could
 you
 imagine
 if
 Acman


comes
 back
 to
 Netflix?
 I
 don't
 know,


dude.
 Could
 you
 be
 a
 fund
 manager
 that


lost
 $470
 million
 on
 a
 stock,
 sold
 at


the
 literal
 bottom,
 watched
 it
 10x
 on


you,
 and
 then
 buy
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 below


its
 10x
 all-time
 high?


I
 mean,
 I
 I
 don't
 It's
 not
 I
 don't
 know


if
 psychologically
 if
 that's
 easy
 to


deal
 with
 because
 again,
 what
 if
 Netflix


falls
 over
 the
 next
 couple
 years?
 I


mean,
 does
 Acman
 sell
 it
 again?


It
 could
 be
 one
 of
 those
 things
 where


just
 psychologically
 it
 tests
 you


deeply.


It's
 Oracle.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 he's
 going
 to
 get
 into


Oracle,
 dude.
 Oracle,
 some
 of these
 fund


managers
 are
 trying
 to
 not
 necessarily


be
 stuck
 in
 the
 AI
 debt
 ecosystem.
 Even


though
 I
 think
 the
 debt
 is
 manageable,
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 scary
 debt
 for
 Oracle.


The
 perception
 of
 it
 might
 be
 weird
 if


they,
 you
 know,
 deeply
 go
 into
 him.
 He


already
 has
 Amazon,
 so
 it
 wouldn't
 be


Amazon
 because
 he
 already
 has
 that
 one.


He
 still
 has
 the
 Nike
 call
 options.
 I


think
 he
 did
 get
 out
 of
 the
 Nike
 stock


and
 just
 got
 into
 calls.
 Those
 calls


aren't
 doing
 well,
 though.
 He
 has
 three


years
 for
 them
 to
 work
 out.
 But
 I
 mean,


if
 anything,
 the
 calls
 I
 think
 he
 bought


them
 at
 70
 or
 72.


I
 don't
 think
 he
 got
 them
 in
 the
 low


60s.


So,
 this
 one
 still
 needs
 to
 outperform


as
 well.
 SoFi,
 did
 we
 go
 green?
 So
 went


green.
 There
 you
 go.
 2687.


All
 right,
 that
 one
 trying
 to
 get
 back


up
 to
 that


27
 level.
 Um,
 another
 report,
 Gemini's


global
 visits
 doubled
 between
 August
 and


November
 while
 Chad
 rose
 about
 1%
 over


the
 same
 period.
 You
 know,
 there's
 a


couple
 of
 headlines
 quoting
 the
 same


figure
 yesterday.
 Uh,
 Gemini
 is
 growing


and
 it's
 growing
 massively


and
 so
 it
 makes
 sense
 that
 the
 traffic


is
 growing.
 Now
 granted,
 Chad
 had
 a
 lot


more
 traffic
 than
 Gemini
 over
 the
 past


couple
 of
 years
 because
 Chad
 existed,


Gemini
 didn't.
 But
 you
 are
 seeing
 a
 lot


more
 people
 get
 excited
 about
 Gemini.
 I


really
 haven't
 been
 a
 avid
 Gemini
 user


to
 be
 honest.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I've
 really
 just


stayed
 on
 CHBT,
 so
 I've
 got
 to
 give
 it


some
 time
 to
 experiment,
 but
 it
 is


something
 that's
 been
 getting
 a
 lot
 more


attention.
 By
 the
 way,
 Elon


uh
 said


this
 yesterday.
 We
 we
 we
 saw
 that
 news.


Wow.
 So
 making
 a
 move,
 trying
 to
 bust


through
 27.
 Uh
 Whimo
 is
 now
 doing


450,000
 paid
 trips
 every
 single
 week,
 up


from
 250,000
 from
 April.


Elon
 said
 yesterday,
 Whimo
 never
 really


had
 a
 chance
 against
 Tesla.
 This
 will
 be


obvious
 in
 hindsight.


And
 this
 is
 off
 a
 report
 that
 Whimo's


volume
 is,


I
 guess,
 not
 as
 exciting
 as
 a
 lot
 of


people
 think
 because
 the
 data
 that's


getting
 them
 to
 get
 these
 trips
 is
 not


the
 type
 of
 quality
 of
 data
 from
 a


foundation
 model
 perspective
 on
 the


training
 that
 Tesla's
 working
 on.
 Now,


granted,
 look,
 I
 think
 Tesla
 is
 going to


do
 very
 well
 in
 the
 robo
 taxi
 race,
 but


Whimo's
 doing
 450,000


paid
 rides
 a
 week.


[laughter]
 Robo
 Tesla's
 promo
 taxi
 is


not
 at
 that
 level
 yet.
 So


if
 Elon
 really
 over
 the
 next
 five
 years


ends
 up
 like
 destroying
 Whimo
 and
 and


you
 know
 he's
 right
 about
 it
 becoming


obvious
 in
 hindsight
 and
 you
 know


Tesla's
 doing
 millions
 and
 millions
 of


pay
 every
 single
 week.
 I
 mean
 Uber
 is


doing
 like
 billions
 per
 month
 um
 and
 he


wins
 the
 entire
 market.
 That
 would
 be


quite
 impressive.
 I
 think
 he's
 going
 to


do
 well
 but
 I
 think
 Whimo
 is
 also
 going


to
 do
 well.
 Like
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 I
 don't


know if
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 an
 8020
 market


share
 split
 unless
 the
 robo
 taxi
 is
 just


that
 much
 better
 of
 an
 experience


and
 maybe
 it
 is
 but
 right
 now
 Whimo
 is


actually


getting
 people
 to
 where
 they
 need
 to
 go


autonomously.

It's

 robo

 scale
 have
 not


manifested

 Tesla.


But
 I
 guess
 that's
 the
 bet,
 right?


That's
 why
 he's
 getting
 a

 to

 if
 he


can

 Hoodie
 at
 135.
 I
 did
 see
 the
 new


SoFi
 smart
 card.
 We
 talked
 about
 that
 in


the
 morning.
 Potentially
 the
 reason


maybe
 SoFi's
 getting
 a
 little bit
 of
 a


bid
 right
 here.


And
 Oracle


stuck
 at
 uh
 stuck
 at
 220.


Um,
 okay.
 Let's
 see
 what
 else
 we've
 got


going
 on.
 Again,
 JPAL
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the


big
 story
 of
 the
 day
 at
 2
 p.m.
 We
 will


see
 what
 the
 Fed
 does.
 Fed
 futures


probabilities
 still
 with
 a


89.6%
 chance.
 I
 mean,
 there
 is
 a
 world


where
 they
 don't
 cut.
 I
 think
 it's
 very


unlikely,
 but
 it's
 9%
 like
 it
 was
 on
 the


last
 meeting.
 Uh
 let's
 get
 some
 coverage


on
 the
 Fed


and
 then
 we
 will
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> Because
 of
 the
 government
 shutdown,


we're
 awaiting
 really
 key
 jobs
 reports.


But
 we
 do
 have
 enough
 data
 to
 have
 a


pretty
 robust
 debate
 about
 just
 how
 much


the
 labor
 market
 is
 softening.
 Remember,


if
 the
 Fed
 thinks
 that
 the
 labor
 market


is
 in
 danger,
 that's
 probably
 why


they're
 cutting
 and
 why
 they
 might
 cut


some
 more.
 So,
 here's
 the
 recent
 data


where
 it
 stacks
 up,
 what
 they're
 going


to
 be
 looking
 at
 on
 the
 weaker
 data


points,
 the
 argument
 for
 cuts,
 for


softening.
 September's
 4.4%
 unemployment


rate.
 That
 was
 the
 highest
 level
 we
 saw


in
 years.
 Not
 good.
 Also,
 yesterday
 we


got
 the
 quits
 rate
 for
 October.
 Carl,


you
 mentioned
 this
 live.
 It
 was
 notable


because
 it
 was
 1.8%.
 Low
 quits
 rate


means
 people
 are
 unconfident
 that


they're
 going
 to
 go
 out
 and
 get
 jobs.


the
 ADP
 report
 November
 ADP's
 taken
 on


more
 significance
 as
 we
 haven't
 gotten


the
 official
 jobs
 data
 that
 had
 a


negative
 number
 on
 it
 negative
 32,000
 on


the
 other
 hand
 you
 know
 for
 those
 that


want
 to
 hold
 rates
 they
 can
 point
 to
 the


job
 openings
 data
 that
 we
 got
 yesterday


7.7
 million
 was
 an
 upside
 surprise
 the


jobless
 claims
 data
 especially
 in
 late


November
 three-year
 low
 so
 fewer


Americans
 filing
 for
 unemployment
 claims


and
 then
 the
 September
 jobs
 number
 yes


it
 was
 a
 high
 unemployment
 number
 But
 we


also
 saw
 more
 than
 100,000
 jobs
 created.


So
 I
 think
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 core


of
 the
 debate.
 We
 know
 inflation
 is
 kind


of
 stuck
 around
 these
 levels
 and


elevated.
 There's
 not
 much
 to
 chew
 on


there.
 Yeah.


>> But
 on
 jobs,
 it
 it's
 really
 a
 question


about
 how
 soft
 are
 we
 getting
 and
 should


they
 make
 a
 bigger
 move.
 It
 seems
 to
 be


netting
 out
 obviously
 that
 their
 risks


to
 the
 labor
 market
 have
 risen
 enough


based
 on
 everything
 that
 the
 Fed


messaging
 has
 implied
 that
 we're
 getting


the
 cut
 today
 and
 that
 if
 you
 convey


data
 dependence,
 non-committal,
 we
 have


a
 split
 Fed,
 we're
 not
 that
 far
 from


neutral,
 all
 those
 things
 you're
 likely


to
 hear
 afterward,
 um
 then
 we
 do
 have


the
 kind
 of
 double
 jobs
 data
 next
 week


that
 could
 sway
 uh
 you
 know
 exactly


where
 the
 the
 outlook
 goes
 for
 next
 year


in
 terms
 of
 rates,
 but
 I
 don't
 think


they're
 going
 to
 pre-commmit
 to
 very


And
 um
 you
 know
 I
 do
 also
 think
 that


you're
 down
 175
 basis
 points
 in
 in
 Fed


funds
 rate
 in
 15
 months.


>> It's
 almost
 after
 today.


>> It's
 after
 today.
 You've
 it's
 almost


never
 happened
 when
 you
 either
 were
 not


in
 a
 recession
 or
 really
 not
 on
 the


verge
 of
 a
 recession
 by
 any
 observable


measure.
 So
 I
 do
 think
 they
 feel
 as
 if


they've
 gotten
 us
 to
 a
 place
 where
 we


can
 wait
 and
 see
 for
 a
 little
 while.
 Um


now
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 means
 that
 the


market
 is
 going
 to
 be
 surprised
 by
 some


kind
 of
 hawkish
 bent.
 I
 think
 the


market's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 digest
 the


fact
 that
 we
 have
 conflicting
 data,


therefore
 a
 conflicted
 committee.
 We're


not
 that
 far
 from
 neutral.
 We're
 going


to
 have
 to
 be
 grown-ups
 and
 and
 deal


with
 the
 data.


>> You
 didn't
 even
 mention
 stocks
 near


all-time
 highs
 going
 into
 a
 period
 of


expected
 reaceleration
 and
 fiscal


tailwinds.


>> I
 do
 think
 that
 part
 of
 it
 is
 relevant


in
 terms
 of,
 you
 know,
 the
 market
 is


telling
 you
 this.
 Every
 economist
 and


strategist
 is
 telling
 you
 this
 that


there
 are
 reasons
 to
 upgrade
 growth


expectations
 going
 into
 next
 year.
 And


if
 that's
 the
 case,
 then
 it
 should
 be
 a


buffer,
 psychological
 buffer,
 a
 real


world
 buffer
 against
 the
 idea
 that
 the


Fed
 is
 going
 to
 be
 proven
 to
 be
 too


tight.
 You
 also
 have
 longer
 term
 yields


inching
 higher.
 They're
 real
 yields
 that


are
 going
 up
 globally.
 So,
 it's
 not


about
 the
 US
 bond
 market
 saying,
 "Oh,


no,
 we're
 inviting
 a
 reaceleration
 of


inflation."
 Really
 isn't
 about
 that.
 Um,


it's
 much
 more
 about,
 you
 know,
 growth


could
 be
 up
 globally
 and
 therefore
 real


yields
 are
 going


>> talking
 about
 hikes
 in
 Australia.


>> Yes.
 And
 Japan.
 And
 almost
 all
 central


banks
 are
 are
 kind
 of
 getting
 to
 a
 point


where
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 doing
 as


much.


>> But
 the
 setup
 is
 so
 different.
 The
 setup


is
 that
 we
 have
 high
 yields.
 I
 mean,
 the


tenure
 at
 4.2,


even
 if
 the
 Fed
 were
 hawkish,
 I
 I'm
 not


sure
 that
 that
 would
 be
 as
 big
 of
 a


surprise
 as
 when
 they
 were
 hawkish
 last.


But
 just
 to
 show
 you,
 so
 everyone's


saying
 this
 is
 a
 divided
 Fed.
 I
 mean,


that
 the
 the
 sort
 of
 chemistry
 and
 where


people
 vote
 and
 how
 many
 dissents
 will


be
 on
 the
 committee.
 That's
 the
 most


interesting
 thing
 going
 into
 today
 as


well,
 because
 we
 haven't
 seen
 this
 in
 a


while.
 And
 we've
 been
 trying
 to
 figure


out
 whi
 which
 voters
 stand
 where
 on
 cuts


because
 there's
 obviously
 been
 a
 lot
 of


talk
 recently.
 So
 here's
 the
 the
 best


guess
 here
 on
 cuts.
 We've
 heard
 New
 York


Fed
 President
 Williams.
 He's
 come
 out


basically
 lean
 toward
 that.
 Waller
 I'd


put
 in
 that
 camp
 as
 well.
 Myin,
 we
 know


that.
 And
 we
 know
 that
 he
 will
 not


jeopardize
 a
 cut
 by
 voting
 to
 cut
 double


as
 he
 has
 in
 the
 last
 two
 meetings
 in


descent.
 Um
 so
 I
 think
 count
 on
 them
 for


a
 cut.
 Likely
 cut.
 So
 we
 I
 put
 in
 the


likely
 position
 Powell
 even
 though
 he


hasn't
 spoken
 much
 since
 the
 last
 at
 all


since
 the
 last
 FC
 meeting.
 Bowman
 I
 put


there
 too.
 She's
 in
 contention
 for
 the


next
 bed
 job
 and
 she's
 leaned
 toward


cuts.
 Jefferson
 who's
 the
 number
 two
 to


Powell.


>> And
 then
 question
 marks
 around
 Cook


Goulsby
 and
 Bar.
 I
 think
 that
 you
 know


haven't
 exactly
 had
 their
 enough
 of
 the


public


commentary.
 Bar
 might
 be
 leaning
 toward


a
 hold.
 And
 then
 the
 no
 cuts,
 Susan


Collins,
 voter,
 she's
 expressed
 that


that's
 what
 sent
 the
 market
 into
 a


tizzy.
 Schmidt
 and
 Mullum
 have
 all


expressed


>> a
 little
 bit
 more
 concern
 about


inflation
 and
 that
 were
 sort
 of
 neutral,


which
 is
 their
 way
 of
 saying
 we


>> no
 need
 to
 do
 anymore.
 Yeah.
 No,


exactly.
 Look,
 in
 the
 in
 the
 meeting,


you
 often
 get
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 trade-off,


like
 I'll
 vote
 for
 the
 cut
 today
 if
 the


language
 says
 that
 we're
 kind
 of
 going


on
 hold.
 Um,
 so
 you
 don't
 know
 if
 it's


going
 to
 translate
 into
 outright


disscent,
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 the
 natural


outgrowth
 of
 being
 at
 this
 moment
 when


unemployment
 definitely
 leaking
 higher


but
 still
 low
 and
 inflation
 not
 really


coming
 down
 right
 away.
 So
 again,
 that


10%
 probability
 is
 there
 based
 on
 some


of
 the
 people
 they
 mentioned
 that
 are


not
 going
 to
 vote
 for
 the
 cut
 or
 that


could
 vote
 for
 it
 if
 they
 know
 they're


going
 to
 be
 holding
 into
 2026
 on
 the


summary
 of
 economic
 projections
 with
 the


dot
 plot.
 But
 the
 majority
 of
 the
 Fed


officials
 look
 like
 they're
 going
 to
 be


voting
 for
 this
 cut.
 But
 Robin
 right


there
 13640
 that
 one
 breaking
 out
 a


little
 bit.
 Soi
 back
 above
 27
 which
 is


nice
 to
 see
 as
 well.
 That's
 up
 about
 1%


as
 we
 get
 into
 it.
 Meta
 recovering
 a


little
 bit
 but
 still
 down
 1%.
 Rivian


still
 below
 18
 and
 then
 Amazon
 holding


231
 below
 232.
 BMR
 she's
 trying
 really


trying
 to
 see
 40
 again.
 Got
 to
 39.95


3957
 right
 here.
 This
 one
 is
 up
 50%
 plus


from
 the
 lows.
 Um,
 so
 you
 know,
 if
 you


took
 a
 swing
 at
 it
 when
 it
 was
 really


getting
 hit
 in
 November,
 which
 it
 was


tough.
 I
 mean,
 the
 narrative
 around


crypto
 in
 general
 was
 pretty
 scary,
 but


you
 are
 seeing
 a
 little
 bit
 more


stabilization
 here


as
 that
 one's
 getting
 some
 more


momentum.


Is
 Rock
 Lab
 up
 40%
 from
 recent
 lows


because
 of
 Neutron?
 Well,
 there
 were
 a


head
 there
 was
 a
 headline
 yesterday


around
 Neutron
 becoming
 much
 easier
 or


the
 pathway
 to
 Neutron's
 uh
 launch


system
 becoming
 active
 in
 2026.
 becoming


much
 more
 likely.
 But
 I
 I
 think
 it's


also
 up
 just
 because
 this
 thing
 took
 a


nasty
 decline
 from
 75
 down
 to
 38.
 So
 a


lot
 of
 these
 names,
 you
 know,
 high


quality
 companies,
 yes,
 they
 were


expensive
 at
 the
 top,
 but
 and
 and


they're
 not
 anywhere
 near,
 you
 know,
 75


again
 like
 Rock
 Lab,
 but
 probably
 didn't


deserve
 to
 get
 hit
 as
 badly
 as
 it
 did.


So
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 are
 recovering,


even
 if
 they're
 not
 massively


recovering,
 but
 if
 you
 got
 them
 at
 the


lows,
 it's
 a
 pretty
 good
 deal.
 You
 know,


if
 you
 got
 Hood
 at
 100
 or
 Rock
 Lab
 at


38,
 even
 SoFi
 at
 23,
 not
 a
 not
 a


horrible
 deal.
 Amazon
 right
 there
 at


231.
 Amazon
 got
 down
 to
 like
 215
 during


that
 time.


Navius
 got
 to
 like
 79.
 Nebas
 right
 here


93


[snorts]
 on
 the
 day.


Um,


what
 did
 people
 say
 on
 the
 poll?
 So,
 I


said
 rate
 cut
 or
 not.
 Yeah,
 pretty
 much


matching
 the
 Fed
 probabilities
 90%.


Now
 JP
 Morgan
 was
 down
 yesterday
 because


they
 warned
 of
 higher
 than
 expected


expenses
 ahead
 and
 a
 more
 fragile


consumer.
 Um
 it
 was
 pretty
 weird.
 They


expected
 105
 billion
 of
 expenses
 next


year
 instead
 of
 a
 hundred
 billion
 and


you
 had
 a
 $900
 billion
 bank
 fall
 by
 50


billion.
 I
 mean
 it
 it
 goes
 to
 show
 how


fragile
 the
 market
 is
 in
 terms
 of
 some


of
 the
 expectations
 they
 have
 for
 these


consumerf
 facing
 companies
 from
 318
 to


300
 happened
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 day


just
 randomly
 based
 on
 a
 quote
 at
 a


conference
 and
 I
 think
 that
 took
 so
 down


to
 all
 the
 banks
 down
 but
 I
 don't
 know


if
 the
 market's
 going
 to
 care
 that


deeply
 about
 those
 comments
 as
 being


bearish
 for
 next
 year.
 Bank
 of
 America,


that
 one's
 flat
 on
 the
 day.
 And
 Goldman


Sachs,


877,
 that's
 also


relatively
 flat.


Um,


I
 know
 the
 day
 is
 far
 from
 over,
 but


didn't
 JC
 say
 Etsy
 could
 make
 a
 move?


Yeah.
 So,
 Etsy
 is
 his
 pick
 of
 the
 week


as
 of
 yesterday
 and
 his
 idea
 is
 holiday


sales
 retail
 retailers
 already
 doing


well
 and
 then
 Etsy
 kind
 of
 being
 stuck


in
 a
 range
 for
 a
 while
 could
 be
 the


breakout
 on
 this
 one.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 of


Etsy
 as
 a
 mini
 Shopify.
 It's
 obviously


not
 as
 large
 or
 as
 big
 in
 terms
 of
 their


volume
 as
 Shopify,
 which
 Shopify
 also


got
 hit
 to
 like
 140
 back
 in
 November.


back
 to
 160
 here.


But
 maybe
 Etsy
 is
 potentially
 a
 sympathy


play.
 Google
 does
 own
 7%
 of
 SpaceX.
 So


if
 uh
 you
 know
 if
 they
 really
 do
 IPO


Google
 going
 green
 at
 1.5
 trillion,


I
 mean


Google's
 going
 to
 love
 that,
 which
 again


I
 I
 kind
 of
 doubt
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 1.5


trillion,
 but
 if
 it
 does
 that
 would
 be


massive.
 So
 Elon
 owns
 42%
 of
 SpaceX.


Fidelity
 owns
 10%.
 Founders
 Fund
 has


10%.
 Peter
 Teal.
 Google
 has
 7.4
 and
 then


the
 other
 30%
 of
 it
 is
 owned
 by
 others.


They
 invested
 900
 million
 into
 SpaceX
 10


years
 ago.
 It's
 now
 worth
 50
 billion.


There's
 a
 56%
 56x
 return


on
 their
 SpaceX.


So,
 if
 this
 thing
 really
 were
 to
 go


public,
 I
 mean,
 you're
 talking
 about
 a


massive
 catalyst
 for
 2026
 for
 Google.


This
 is
 what
 Tom
 Lee
 said
 today.


Contrarian
 take,
 today
 is
 the
 Fed
 day.


Markets
 have
 been
 labored
 and
 struggling


for
 the
 past
 four
 weeks.
 Nobody
 wants
 to


be
 long
 stocks
 in
 front
 of
 a
 hawkish


cut.
 To
 me,
 it
 seems
 to
 raise
 the


probabilities
 that
 stocks
 rally
 post
 Fed


decision,
 which
 is
 contrarian,
 right?


Because
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 hawkish


cut,
 which
 pretty
 much
 everyone
 is


assuming
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 this
 hawkish


cut,
 you
 would
 think
 everyone's
 getting


ready
 to
 sell
 the
 news,
 which
 means
 if


everyone's
 getting
 ready
 to
 sell
 the


news,


maybe
 we
 don't
 sell
 the
 news


and
 that
 could
 lead
 to
 a
 little
 bit
 more


momentum.
 Mardo
 Libre.
 This
 one's
 just


been
 annoying
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 of


months.
 That
 one's
 down
 another
 5%.


They're
 having
 some
 issues
 in
 their
 home


country,
 particularly
 in
 forms
 of


competition,
 margin
 decline.
 Stocks
 up


11%
 year
 to
 date,
 down
 another
 5%
 today.


Um,


BABA's
 up
 a
 little
 bit,
 but
 some
 of


these
 international
 stocks
 have
 been


taking
 a
 hit.
 Baba,
 that's
 up
 2.48%


on
 the
 day.


Does
 anyone
 own
 SpaceX
 in
 uh
 in
 their


portfolio?
 I
 mean,
 we
 know
 our
 boy


Suchin
 has
 this
 one.
 SpaceX
 is
 one
 of


the
 most
 liquid
 secondary
 names
 and
 it's


been
 traded
 around
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 So,


I
 think
 there
 are
 more
 retail
 investors


than
 not
 that
 do
 have
 access
 to
 this


one.


So,
 this
 would
 be
 a
 pretty
 big
 event
 if


it
 ends
 up
 going
 public.
 I
 do
 not
 own


SpaceX.
 I
 had
 some
 opportunities
 last


year
 to
 buy
 it,
 but
 I
 don't know,
 dude.


At
 at
 that
 valuation,
 I
 was
 also
 like,


well,


I
 could
 buy
 hood
 at
 $20,
 you
 know,
 so
 I


never
 ended
 up
 buying
 it.
 But
 for
 the


people
 that
 have
 been
 in
 it
 for
 the
 past


five
 years,
 it's
 done
 very
 well.
 BMR


right
 there,
 39.50.
 And
 then
 SoFi
 still


below
 27.
 Wow.
 Netflix
 continues
 to
 get


hit.
 9516.


Lowest
 we've
 seen
 it
 in
 about
 a
 week.


[snorts]


Okay.
 Tokenized
 SpaceX.
 Yes,
 there
 is
 a


there
 is
 a
 way
 of
 that.
 Yeah,
 we
 talked


about
 PAB
 this
 morning.
 That
 one's


making
 a
 massive
 move.
 I
 mean,
 we'll


we'll
 be
 doing
 a
 Twitter
 spaces
 with


stock
 talk
 later
 today.


We'll
 talk
 about
 his
 perspective
 on
 if


it's
 still
 a
 buy,
 but
 44%
 massive


massive
 move.
 Very
 similar
 to
 Amcor.


American
 onshore
 manufacturing
 theme
 is


kind
 of
 the
 the
 broader
 thematic
 for
 a


lot
 of
 these
 names.


and
 this
 one
 just
 crushed
 earnings.
 I


mean,
 honestly,
 that's
 probably
 why


Amcor
 is
 running
 today
 because
 they're


in
 the
 same
 niche
 even
 though
 they're


slightly
 different.
 So,
 Amcor
 is


probably
 catching
 a
 bid
 off
 that
 entire


thematic
 going
 vertical.
 Shopify
 160,


Google


at
 318.
 Netflix
 is
 going
 through
 what


Chipotle
 did
 after
 the
 split.
 You
 know,


there
 is
 that
 conspiracy
 which
 is
 backed


by
 a
 lot
 of
 data.
 So,
 maybe
 it's
 not
 a


conspiracy
 that
 every
 stock
 after
 it


splits


gets
 hurt
 pretty
 bad.
 It
 happened
 to


Nvidia
 as
 well.
 I
 mean,
 literally,


Nvidia
 took
 like
 a
 35%
 haircut.
 Now,


granted,
 you
 had
 Deep
 Seek
 and
 all
 this,


but
 still,
 every
 time
 you
 have
 a
 split,


these
 stocks
 get
 hit.


So,
 maybe
 that's
 just
 continuing


with
 uh
 with
 Netflix.


Netflix,
 but
 like
 November
 17th,
 I


think,
 roundabout.
 Dude,
 Netflix
 at
 the


top
 was
 like
 what
 130


134


$16
 back
 in
 2022
 up
 to
 134.


They've
 completely
 gotten
 rid
 of
 most
 of


their
 gains
 for
 for
 this
 year.


Trailing
 PE
 now
 on
 Netflix
 is
 39.


39.
 It
 was
 at
 around
 50


54
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago.


Um,


why
 is
 Nebus
 down?
 I
 have
 no
 idea.
 Dude,


a
 lot
 of
 these
 data
 center
 names,
 they


just


you
 can't
 even
 give
 a
 reason
 for
 them.


There's
 no
 dilution.
 There's
 no
 this,


there's
 no
 that.
 I
 mean,
 why
 was
 it
 up


to
 $100
 yesterday?
 I
 don't
 know.


I
 like,
 you
 know,
 I've
 been
 in
 some


volatile
 names.
 These
 data
 center
 names


are
 volatile.


Like
 I
 didn't
 realize
 how
 aggressively


volatile
 these
 guys
 are,


which
 makes
 the
 premiums
 amazing
 if


you're
 selling
 options
 on
 them.
 But
 it


also
 means
 you
 can
 easily
 get
 assigned


up
 or
 down
 on
 these
 stocks,


but
 I
 don't
 see
 a
 headline
 for
 for
 Nebas


here.
 Uh
 here's
 a
 quick
 update
 on
 Meta


and


part
 of
 the
 new
 model
 monetization


strategy


that
 we
 saw
 yesterday
 in
 terms
 of
 the


headline


with
 Meta
 typically
 is
 they
 hire
 you


know
 XA
 AI
 expert
 from
 Apple.
 They've


hired
 up
 so
 much
 talent.
 You'd
 think


that
 they
 have
 an
 insane
 bench
 and
 that


things
 are
 going
 smoothly.
 Does
 this


suggest
 that
 things
 are
 not
 going
 so


smoothly
 with
 Meta
 and
 their
 development


of
 their
 AI
 offering?
 Well,
 in
 the
 first


instance
 when
 the
 story
 hit,
 there
 was
 a


kind
 of
 strange
 algo
 spike
 and
 then
 drop


in
 the
 shares,
 but
 we're
 now
 down
 one


and
 a
 half%.
 So,
 it's
 difficult
 to


interpret
 the
 markets
 read
 on
 meta


shifting
 to
 close
 model.
 What
 uh
 Kurt


Wagner
 and
 Riley
 Griffin,
 our


colleagues,
 are
 reporting
 is
 a
 lot
 of


detail
 about
 the
 specific
 model
 Avocado,


which
 had
 originally
 been
 planned
 as
 an


open
 model
 and
 according
 to
 sources
 may


launch
 as
 a
 closed
 model.
 It's


interesting
 in
 the
 technology


development
 side
 because
 what
 Meta
 did


was
 take
 models
 from
 others
 including
 um


you
 know
 Alibaba's
 Gwen
 model
 for


example
 and
 use
 that
 existing
 work
 to


distill
 and
 prepare
 their
 own
 model.


That's
 something
 that
 you
 know
 Frontier


Labs
 do
 all
 the
 time.
 Um
 but
 it's
 not


new
 the
 idea
 that
 Meta
 might
 go
 from
 a


very
 clear
 open-source
 approach
 to


closed.
 Mark
 Zuckerberg
 talked
 about
 it


in
 July's
 earnings
 call.
 Basically


saying
 at
 some
 point
 in
 an
 open
 source


world,
 the
 models
 are
 so
 big
 and
 the


resource
 requirements
 are
 so
 high.


What's
 the
 point?
 Academics
 don't
 have


the
 funds
 to
 to
 work
 at
 that
 scale.
 And


really,
 it's
 only
 relevant
 to
 private


industry
 if
 you're
 working
 on
 a
 model


that
 that
 has
 that
 that
 level
 of


parameter
 and
 requirement.


Again,


I
 think
 the
 fear
 of
 meta
 is
 that
 outside


of
 advertising,
 where
 is
 the
 AI
 ROI


coming
 from?
 It's
 a
 legit
 argument
 to
 be


discussed
 on
 meta.
 It
 shouldn't
 be


because
 the
 business
 should
 be
 worth


closer
 to
 $800
 without
 this
 AI
 overhang.


But
 Google
 had
 an
 AI
 overhang.
 Amazon


had
 an
 AI
 overhang
 in
 terms
 of
 their


cloud.
 I
 mean,
 like
 these
 AI
 overhangs


are
 very
 real.
 And
 until
 these
 companies


prove
 that
 their
 capex
 is
 valuable
 for


something
 outside
 of
 the
 core
 business,


even
 if
 they're
 trading
 at
 an
 18
 forward


PE,
 which
 I
 agree
 is
 pretty
 stupid,


they
 end
 up
 getting
 hit.


So
 really,
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the


question
 on
 what
 avocado
 potentially


could
 be
 doing.


Yeah,
 meta's
 avocado.
 Google's
 nano


banana.
 Apple
 should
 be
 apple,
 carrots,


and
 celery.
 That's
 hilarious.


These
 code
 names
 are
 so
 weird.


But
 but
 like
 Google
 ended
 up,
 you
 know,


Nano
 Banana
 ended
 up
 becoming
 like
 a


real
 name.


As
 a
 millennial,
 I
 eat
 avocado
 toast.


You
 know,
 I've
 never
 had
 avocado
 toast.


Is
 it
 good?
 I've
 never
 put
 avocado
 on


toast.
 I
 like
 butter
 on
 toast.


Like
 some
 butter
 on
 some
 warm
 crunchy


toast.
 But
 it
 can't
 be
 too
 crunchy.
 It


has
 to
 be
 like
 a
 certain
 type
 of


crunchy.


But
 I've
 never
 I've
 never
 done
 avocado


on
 toast.


Did
 everyone
 eat
 breakfast
 this
 morning?


Are
 we
 eating
 breakfast
 right
 now?
 Or


for
 those
 that
 it's
 night,
 are
 you


eating
 dinner?
 I
 think
 I
 think
 I've


legit
 gone
 three
 years
 without
 eating


breakfast
 in
 the
 morning.
 At least
 when


I
 have
 a
 show.
 When
 I
 have
 a
 show,
 I


don't
 think
 I
 eat
 breakfast.
 It's
 been
 a


long
 time


since
 I
 ate
 something
 before
 the
 show.


Like
 I
 can't
 even
 after
 three
 years,
 I


can't
 imagine
 eating
 something
 and
 then


talking
 for
 three
 hours.


Like
 I
 legit
 cannot
 imagine
 doing
 that.


Pounds
 right
 there,
 185.
 That's
 up
 2%.


And
 then
 ESTs,


that's
 up
 2%.
 Okay.
 Celsius
 is
 not
 a


breakfast
 rate.
 The
 these
 people
 that


drink
 energy
 drinks
 for
 breakfast.
 You


guys
 are
 crazy.


Celsius


for
 freaking
 breakfast.


Red
 Bull
 for
 breakfast.
 You
 guys
 are


wild,
 bro.


That
 is
 not
 a
 breakfast.
 How
 do
 you
 even


drink
 an
 energy?
 Like,
 look,
 I
 don't


hate
 a
 good
 nice
 cold
 Red
 Bull


sometimes,
 but
 in
 the
 morning,
 9:00
 a.m.


downing
 a
 Red
 Bull.


It's
 wild.


Yeah,
 like
 coffee
 is
 better
 than
 that.


Goodness
 gracious.


I've
 been
 doing
 Red
 Bull
 for
 breakfast


for
 a
 long
 time.
 All right,
 that's


crazy.
 That's
 actually
 crazy.
 It's
 like


legit
 crazy.


like
 in
 the
 morning
 is
 a
 bit
 aggressive.


Dude,
 if
 I
 if
 I
 do
 go
 downstairs
 and


like
 get
 a
 co
 they
 have
 like
 free
 coffee


if
 I
 end
 up
 getting
 a
 co
 I
 drink
 like


two
 sips
 of
 it
 just
 to
 like
 have


something
 hot
 in
 the
 morning
 and
 I
 never


end
 up
 drinking
 the
 whole
 thing.
 And
 I


put
 a
 ton
 of
 cream
 in
 it
 just
 to
 like


make
 it
 even
 drinkable
 because
 I
 I
 don't


know.
 I
 thought
 I'd
 be
 able
 to
 drink


black
 coffee.
 I
 I
 It's
 hard.
 I
 I
 had
 it


a
 year
 ago.
 I
 was
 like, "Oh,
 maybe
 I
 can


drink
 black
 coffee."
 It's
 like
 I
 just


can't
 drink
 black
 coffee,
 dude.
 It's


tough
 to
 drink
 it
 through.
 Amcco
 right


there
 46
 that's
 still
 up
 3%.
 Photronics


45%


continuing
 to
 make
 its
 move.
 And
 then


Meta
 trying
 to
 recover
 at
 650.


The
 time
 of
 the
 Reiken
 announcement
 is


at
 2
 p.m.
 2
 p.m.
 2:20
 I'll
 be
 live.


Black
 coffee
 over
 ice
 is
 solid.


Yeah,
 the
 same
 thing.
 the
 people
 that


drink
 like
 cold
 black
 coffee
 in
 the


morning.
 I
 don't
 know,
 dude.
 That
 that's


quite
 incredible.
 The
 only
 thing
 cold
 I


can
 drink
 in
 the
 morning
 is
 like
 a


latte.
 It's
 like
 it
 has
 to
 be
 like
 a


like
 a
 caramel
 latte.
 But
 I
 don't
 even


drink
 those
 anymore.
 I
 used
 to
 a
 couple


years
 ago.
 I
 used
 to
 like
 really
 enjoy


that.
 But
 like
 I
 kind
 of
 stopped
 back
 in


2024.


So
 now
 I
 just
 drink
 nothing.


Just
 drink
 water.


[laughter]


Dude,
 some
 of
 these
 breakfastes.
 You
 can


eat
 raw
 steak
 but
 can't
 drink
 coffee.
 It


wasn't
 raw.
 It
 was
 rare.
 Definitely


wasn't
 medium
 rare,
 but
 it
 was
 rare.
 GE


Veronova
 still
 up
 12%.
 Nvidia
 not


getting
 a
 bid.
 184


not
 moving.
 Continues
 to
 be
 stuck
 at


that
 184
 level.
 Uh
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this


chart
 right
 here.
 Let's
 go
 through
 some


of
 these
 macro
 charts
 that
 we
 have.
 Uh
 2


p.m.
 Eastern.
 2
 p.m.
 Eastern,
 we're


going to
 get
 the
 announcement
 for
 the


Fed
 decision.
 Uh,
 US
 car
 affordability.


The
 average
 price
 of
 a
 new
 car
 is
 now


$50,000


according
 to
 a
 Kelly
 Blue
 Book.
 I


remember
 paying
 21,000
 for
 my
 Honda


Civic
 back
 in
 2019.
 The
 Tesla
 was


41,000,
 but
 I
 had
 0%
 APR.
 Uh,
 an
 average


car
 now
 in
 the
 country
 is
 50,000.
 The


average
 new
 car
 loan
 amount
 is
 up
 to
 a


record
 41,000.
 Since
 the
 start
 of
 2020,


the
 average
 amount
 financed
 on
 a
 new


vehicle
 has
 risen
 uh
 9,000
 or
 28%.
 Total


auto
 debt
 jumped
 four
 billion
 in
 October


to
 an
 all-time
 high
 of
 1.56
 trillion.
 I


mean,
 those
 subprime
 auto
 loans
 have


been
 delinquent,
 the
 highest
 they've


been
 since
 2008.


This
 is
 why
 Trump
 keeps
 talking
 about


affordability
 because,
 you
 know,
 the


Democrats
 going
 into
 the
 midterms
 are


going
 to
 be
 pointing
 to
 stats
 like
 this.


And
 obviously,
 rightfully
 or
 wrongly,


they're
 going to
 be
 blaming
 the
 current


administration
 on
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 costs


50,000
 bucks
 to
 to
 get
 a
 car.


So,
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 definitely
 going
 to


be
 something,
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to


be
 a
 much
 larger
 argument
 going
 into
 the


new
 year.


But
 50
 grand
 is
 aggressive,
 dude.
 Like,


it
 I
 mean,
 realistically,
 you've
 got
 to


trade
 in
 your
 old
 car
 and
 hopefully
 get


some
 cash
 just
 to
 kind
 of
 ease
 up
 the


down
 payment
 on
 buying
 a
 new
 car.


But
 it
 is
 aggressive.
 And
 that
 that's


why
 I
 was
 so
 quick
 to
 buy
 my
 Tesla


because
 once
 I
 saw
 0%
 APR,
 I
 was
 like,


"Okay,
 a
 Tesla
 giving
 me
 use
 0%
 APR
 is


not
 going
 to
 happen
 that
 often."
 And


obviously
 Elon's
 trying
 to
 get
 his


numbers
 up.
 I
 think
 this
 was
 Q4
 of
 2024.


And
 so
 that's
 why
 I
 jumped
 on
 it.


But
 it's
 hard
 to
 get
 a
 really
 decent


interest
 rate


and
 getting
 a
 car.
 Well,
 the
 used
 car


market
 is
 also
 going
 I
 mean,
 that's
 part


of
 the
 reason
 why
 Carvana
 has
 been
 doing


so
 well.
 Now,
 ironically,
 and
 I
 don't


know
 the
 difference
 between
 CarMax
 and


Carvana,
 I
 ended
 up
 selling
 my
 old
 Civic


to
 CarMax,
 um,
 but
 CarMax
 is
 down
 30%
 on


the
 year.
 Carvana
 is
 up
 140%
 on
 the


year.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 different
 Carvana


is
 from
 CarMax.
 I
 imagine
 there's


something
 different
 in
 the
 way
 that
 they


actually
 uh,
 finance
 the
 deals.
 And
 I


think
 Carvana
 has
 more
 to
 do
 with
 the


loans.
 CarMax
 maybe
 doesn't.


Two
 business
 models
 that
 should
 be
 the


same,
 completely
 different
 stock


performances.


Which
 begs
 the
 question,
 what
 the
 hell


is
 Carvana
 doing
 that's
 different
 than


CarMax?


But
 both
 those
 stocks
 went
 the
 opposite


direction.


I
 make
 six
 figures
 a
 year
 and
 I
 still


ride
 the
 public
 bus.
 Dude,
 I
 used
 the


bus
 and
 the
 train
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 I


made
 a
 long
 long
 time.
 I
 I
 didn't
 get
 my


license
 till
 I
 was
 21
 cuz
 the
 day
 I
 had


my
 test
 when
 I
 was
 in
 high
 school,
 I
 was


at
 a
 debate
 tournament
 in
 California
 and


then
 it
 was
 a
 combination
 of
 me
 being


lazy
 to
 not
 take
 the
 driver's
 test
 again


for
 like
 three
 years.
 And
 I
 know
 it's


like
 three
 years
 of
 laziness,
 but
 the


real
 reason
 is
 because
 I
 think
 I
 was


afraid
 of
 driving.
 Like
 I
 had
 this


little
 fear
 of
 like
 driving
 and
 being
 on


the
 road
 and
 just
 afraid
 of
 car
 crashes


and
 stuff.
 And
 I
 don't
 know
 why,
 but


there
 was
 something
 in
 me
 that
 made
 me


afraid
 of
 it.
 But
 once
 I
 finally
 just


like
 took
 some
 lessons
 and
 got
 my
 first


car,
 like
 that
 fear
 went
 away
 pretty


quickly.
 And
 then
 I
 started
 driving
 like


150
 miles
 a
 day
 uh
 in
 this
 in
 this
 side


job
 I
 was
 working
 at
 back
 in
 2019.


So
 it
 took
 me
 a
 while,
 but
 once
 I
 got


it,
 I
 started
 driving.
 Got
 my
 license
 at


14
 in
 Nebraska
 on
 a
 farm
 permit.
 They


let
 you
 do
 that
 in
 Nebraska.


Farm
 [snorts]
 permit.


That's
 crazy,
 dude.


14.


Oh,
 I
 was
 legit
 scared.
 I
 was
 like


legit.
 I
 don't know
 why
 it
 was
 like
 an


irrational
 fear.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 By
 the


way,
 I
 forgot
 when
 you're
 sick
 how
 crazy


the
 dreams
 are
 because
 the
 dreams
 I've


been
 having
 over
 the
 past
 two
 days.
 Even


last
 night,
 dude.
 I
 mean,
 goodness.
 Last


night
 I
 was
 kidnapped.
 I
 was
 legit


kidnapped
 and
 I
 woke
 up
 and
 I
 was
 like,


"What
 is
 going
 on,
 bro?"
 And
 then


Sunday,
 I
 don't
 even
 want
 to
 remember


the
 dreams
 I
 had
 on
 Sunday,
 but
 it
 was


bad.
 I
 forgot
 like
 when
 you're
 sick,
 at


least
 when
 I've
 been
 sick
 historically,


the
 dreams
 get
 bad.


Yeah,
 it's
 the
 Nyquil
 kicking
 in,
 the


Tylenol
 kicking
 in.


I
 was
 just
 like,
 "What
 are
 these
 dreams,


bro?"
 I
 don't
 know
 who
 kidnapped
 me,
 but


someone
 kidnapped
 me
 and
 I
 was
 stuck.


And
 it
 was
 just
 like


I
 don't know.
 The
 dreams
 are
 not
 the


best.


The
 dreams
 are
 not
 the
 best.


I've
 been
 driving
 some
 since
 9
 years


old.
 Okay,
 I
 don't
 believe
 that.
 Driving


since
 I
 was
 9
 years
 old.
 Get
 out
 of


here.
 9
 years
 old.
 It's
 ridiculous.
 But


if
 that's
 true,


it's
 kind
 of
 crazy.
 It
 was
 Steve.


[laughter]


Oh
 my
 gosh.


Freaking
 Steve.
 Look
 at
 what
 he
 just


texted
 me,
 bro.
 Someone
 probably
 gave


this
 to
 him.
 He
 texted
 us
 like
 10


minutes
 ago.
 Look
 at
 this.
 This
 guy
 must


be
 so
 happy.
 Look
 at
 all
 these


chocolates.


If
 you
 work
 corporate,


you
 know
 that
 you're
 probably
 this
 is


the
 time
 where
 you
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 gifts
 or


you
 have
 to
 give
 a
 lot
 of
 gifts.
 And
 I


know
 cuz
 uh
 when
 my
 mom
 used
 to
 work
 at


a
 school,
 I
 mean
 around
 December,
 there


would
 be
 just
 so
 many
 gifts
 that
 she


would
 have
 to
 give
 out
 or
 that
 she
 would


get.
 So,
 if
 you
 work
 corporate
 and


especially
 if
 you're
 at
 like
 a


management
 position,
 you
 kind
 of
 have
 to


give
 out
 gifts.
 It's
 kind
 of
 like
 rude


if
 you
 don't,
 I
 guess.
 So,
 he's
 probably


going
 to
 get
 a
 ton
 of
 these
 chocolates.


Is
 Nvidia
 dumping
 Nvidia?


Oh
 my
 goodness.
 She's
 going
 down.


Why
 are
 they
 kidnapping
 Nvidia
 from


being
 successful?


Why
 can't
 they
 just
 let
 her
 breathe?


Why
 are
 they
 doing
 this?
 Let's
 get
 an


update
 on
 Nvidia
 and
 see
 what's
 going
 on


with
 China,
 but
 Nvidia
 now
 below


below
 184.


>> Still
 a
 lot
 of
 China
 hawks
 who
 I've


spoken
 with
 on
 the
 hill
 who
 are
 worried


about
 the
 US
 keeping
 its
 dominance
 in


AI.
 Now,
 Republicans
 who
 I've
 spoke


with,
 they
 avoided
 criticizing
 Trump


directly,
 but
 it
 was
 clear
 they
 were


worried
 about
 the
 impacts
 of
 this


decision.
 Here's
 two
 of
 the
 senators
 I


spoke
 with.
 Lindsey
 Graham
 and
 Josh


Holl's


golf
 in
 in
 my
 head
 here.
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


don't
 want
 to
 give
 them
 a
 I
 don't
 mind


doing
 normal
 business
 with
 China.
 But
 if


you
 can
 prove
 to
 me
 this
 will
 accelerate


their
 military
 capability,
 I'll
 oppose


it.


>> But
 if
 we
 want
 to
 beat
 China,
 I
 think
 we


need
 to
 constrain
 their
 ability
 to
 uh


leverage
 our
 own
 technology.
 So
 I
 would


think
 that
 we'd
 want
 to
 reduce
 their


access
 to
 our
 hardware,
 not
 increase
 it.


Now,
 while
 there
 is
 still
 fierce


opposition
 on
 the
 Hill,
 not
 all


lawmakers
 see
 the
 H20
 going
 to
 China
 as


a
 risk.
 We
 spoke
 yesterday
 with
 Senator


Mike
 Browns.
 He
 told
 me
 that
 he
 supports


the
 sale
 in
 part
 because
 he
 believes


it's
 important
 that
 developers
 in
 China


and
 around
 the
 world
 build
 AI
 with
 those


US
 chips.
 And
 that's
 similar
 to
 the


argument
 that
 Nvidia's
 Jensen
 Hong
 made


in
 his
 pitch
 to
 lawmakers
 when
 he
 was
 up


on
 the
 hill
 just
 last
 week
 meeting
 with


that
 group
 that
 oversees
 export


controls.
 Several
 lawmakers
 also
 told
 me


they
 are
 still
 working
 to
 find
 a
 path


forward
 on
 export
 controls
 and
 other


limits
 to
 try
 to
 ensure
 that
 the
 US


keeps
 its
 lead
 on
 AI.
 That
 could
 include


things
 like
 tracking
 and
 chips.
 But


guys,
 we'll
 just
 have
 to
 keep
 an
 eye
 on


see
 exactly
 how
 much
 momentum
 this
 group


is
 able
 to
 make,
 especially
 with
 the


White
 House
 going
 in
 a
 different


direction.
 Guys,


>> I
 wonder
 too,
 Emily,
 how
 you
 think
 it


affects
 relationships
 with
 the
 Middle


East,
 given
 that
 some
 of
 the
 China
 hawks


have
 tried
 to
 theorize
 whether
 or
 not


China
 would
 get
 some
 of
 these
 materials


from
 the
 UAE,
 Qatar,
 or
 others
 in
 that


in
 that
 region.


>> I
 mean,
 it's
 definitely
 something
 that


lawmakers
 are
 cognizant
 of,
 Carl.
 I


mean,
 when
 I
 speak
 with
 them,
 they
 do


mention
 their
 relationships
 with
 the


Middle
 East
 as
 far
 as
 them
 being
 a


partner,
 as
 far
 as
 them
 getting
 some
 of


these
 chips,
 as
 far
 as
 what
 their


relationship
 is
 with
 China.
 It's
 another


component
 here
 and
 I
 think
 for
 a
 lot
 of


lawmakers
 they're
 still
 exactly
 figuring


out
 where
 the
 US
 stands
 in
 AI
 what
 the


best
 course
 of
 action
 is
 going
 forward.


Certainly
 everyone
 up
 here
 wants
 the
 US


to
 remain
 dominant
 but
 there
 is
 a
 clear


divide
 in
 what
 needs
 [snorts]
 to
 be
 done


to
 get
 there.


>> I
 think
 it's
 been
 challenging
 for
 every


administration
 in
 recent
 history
 and


that
 the
 broader
 point
 which
 is
 what
 is


China?
 Is
 it
 is
 it
 an
 adversary
 and
 and


how
 do
 we
 treat
 it?
 Because
 clearly


there's
 a
 there's
 an
 interdependence
 we


need.
 We
 saw
 that
 with
 the
 rare
 earth


mineral
 minerals
 and
 magnets
 um
 in
 the


trade
 deal.
 But
 it's
 it
 gets
 murky
 when


you
 talk
 about
 ships
 using
 them
 for


militarization
 because
 that
 has
 been
 the


pattern
 that
 we've
 seen
 from
 China
 even


when
 we
 try
 to
 engage
 them
 in


negotiations.


>> And
 Sarah,
 I
 mean
 we're
 even
 seeing


things,
 you
 know,
 I
 mentioned
 that


package
 that
 initially
 they
 had
 that


chips
 limit
 in
 that
 then
 got
 dropped.


That
 package
 does
 also
 include
 other


things
 that
 are
 kind
 of
 setting
 up
 a


wall
 between
 the
 US
 and
 China.
 Things


like
 limiting
 certain
 investments
 in


Chinese
 companies
 associated
 with
 the


military
 or
 limiting
 how
 American


phaceutical
 companies
 can
 work
 when


contract
 with
 Chinese
 counterparts.
 So


there
 is
 still
 a
 strong
 sentiment
 up


here
 on
 Capitol
 Hill
 that
 they
 need
 to


be
 very
 very
 wary
 when
 dealing
 with


anything
 particularly
 with
 the
 Chinese


military
 or
 with
 advanced
 technology.


But
 you
 are
 of
 course
 seeing
 the
 White


House
 being
 more
 open
 to
 the
 argument


put
 forward
 by
 Nvidia
 and
 others.


>> Emily,
 thanks.
 We'll
 talk
 soon.
 Emily


Wilkins
 in
 DC.
 Here's
 the
 question.
 If
 I


was
 a
 reporter
 and
 I
 was
 asking
 um


Lindsey
 Graham
 and
 Josh
 Holly
 about


Nvidia
 and
 this
 is
 the
 real
 question,


and
 I'm
 not
 saying
 it's
 the
 best


question,
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 one
 of the


more
 realistic
 questions
 that
 needs
 to


be
 asked.
 Their
 argument
 is
 we
 might
 not


want
 to
 give
 the
 chips
 to
 China.
 Okay,


fair
 enough.
 If
 hypothetically
 you
 were


to
 assume
 that
 Nvidia
 stock
 were
 to
 fall


dramatically,
 aka
 the
 value
 of
 the


company,
 which
 I
 don't
 think
 is
 going
 to


happen
 if
 they
 don't
 sell
 to
 China


because
 they
 have
 plenty
 of
 demand.
 But


let's
 say
 that
 were
 to
 be
 the
 case,
 that


Nvidia's
 future
 trajectory
 of
 growth
 was


contingent
 upon
 their
 ability
 to


continue
 selling
 into
 China.


Every
 American
 401k
 right
 now
 is


dependent
 on
 Nvidia.


The
 American
 economy
 is
 dependent
 on


Nvidia.
 So
 I
 I
 think
 the
 real
 question


for
 these
 politicians
 is
 are
 you
 willing


to
 let
 Nvidia
 be
 stagnant
 or
 fall
 by
 a


significant
 percentage
 not
 a
 50%
 drop


but
 maybe
 a
 you
 know
 25
 even
 15%
 hit
 and


then
 stay
 there


in
 the
 name
 of
 national
 security
 because


the
 economic
 national
 security
 of
 this


entire
 country
 essentially
 relying
 on


Nvidia
 is
 also
 something
 to
 consider.


Now
 you
 know
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 nuance
 to


that
 conversation.
 There's
 also
 a
 lot
 of


push
 back
 you
 could
 have
 to
 that


argument
 that
 well,
 you
 know,
 even
 if


Nvidia
 falls
 15%,
 the
 American
 economy


will
 be
 fine,
 all
 that
 stuff.
 But
 it
 is


an
 argument
 and
 I
 think
 Trump
 is


learning
 more
 and
 more
 that
 Nvidia
 needs


to
 be
 able
 to
 win
 because
 whatever
 mess


we've
 gotten
 ourselves
 into
 with
 this
 AI


revolution
 over
 the
 next
 over
 the
 last


three
 years,
 it
 has
 led
 to
 this
 stock


being
 at
 the
 center
 of
 everything,
 which


is
 probably
 not
 the
 healthiest,
 but


nonetheless,
 this
 is
 what
 we've
 got.


And
 so,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think
 there
 is


an
 argument
 that
 Nvidia
 needs
 to
 sustain


itself
 and
 continue
 to
 do
 well
 for
 the


American
 economy
 to
 continue.
 Again,
 50%


of
 GDP
 since
 2023
 has
 been
 capex.
 That


capex
 doesn't
 happen
 unless
 you
 have


Nvidia.
 There
 is
 no
 American
 economic


growth
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 years
 unless


you
 have
 Nvidia.
 So,
 I
 don't
 feel
 like


we're
 being
 hyperbolic
 to
 to
 overstate


the
 importance
 of
 it.
 But
 there
 is
 an


argument
 that
 you
 know
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day
 if
 China
 develops
 militaristic
 AI


using
 Nvidia
 chips
 and
 you
 know
 that's


not
 the
 best
 for
 national
 security.


So
 I
 think
 there's
 two
 things
 going
 back


and
 forth
 here


as
 we
 analyze
 it.
 Yeah.
 I'll
 be
 having


Matt
 Babin
 come
 on
 the
 stream
 in
 about


10
 minutes.
 He
 is
 the
 head
 of
 energy
 and


natural
 resources
 at
 Palunteer.
 So
 he'll


be
 on
 to
 talk
 about
 this
 ship
 OS
 deal


with
 the
 Navy
 and
 we'll
 get
 his


perspective
 as
 well.
 Also
 I
 uploaded
 a


video
 last
 night.
 That
 video
 uh
 includes


the
 Nvidia
 interview
 that
 I
 did
 at


Palunteer's
 December
 event.
 So
 if
 you


watch
 the
 first
 15
 minutes
 of
 that


interview,
 you'll
 see
 uh
 the
 or
 15


minutes
 of
 that
 hourlong
 video.
 It's
 the


Palenter
 and
 Nvidia
 spokespeople


speaking
 about
 their
 partnership


[snorts]


and
 uh
 yeah,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 pretty
 cool


chain
 reaction.
 Paler
 is
 now
 entering


into
 the
 data
 center
 space.
 Data
 centers


are
 growing
 massively.
 Software
 is


needed
 to
 make
 those
 data
 centers
 work.


And
 so
 it
 does
 seem
 like
 that
 is
 going


to
 be
 a
 really
 strong
 partnership
 over


the
 next


over
 the
 next
 coming
 weeks.
 Uh
 134.95


right
 here


on
 hoodie


as
 that
 one
 is
 flat.
 Amazon
 and
 Google


do
 use
 their
 own
 chips
 but
 again
 they


are
 buying
 lots
 and
 lots
 of
 Nvidia
 GPUs


for
 their
 cloud
 computing.
 They
 are


training
 some
 of
 their
 own
 models
 on


their
 chips
 and
 they're
 helping
 some
 of


their
 enterprise
 clients
 like
 Anthropic


train
 on
 their
 chips
 on
 their
 custom
 MS6


but
 for
 GCP
 and
 AWS
 the
 AI
 workloads
 are


running
 on
 Blackwell
 you
 know
 that's
 why


they
 are
 the
 highest
 spenders
 along
 with


Microsoft
 on
 these
 Nvidia
 GPUs


and
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 that's
 slowing


down
 Microsoft
 though
 of
 day
 at
 479
 I


have
 no
 headline
 on
 Bloom
 Energy
 I
 know


that
 one's
 getting
 hit
 7%
 I
 have
 no


headline
 on
 Nabius
 and
 no
 headline


on
 Microsoft.


Also,
 no
 headline
 on
 Uber.
 Why
 is
 Uber


down
 4%.
 Like


Uber
 just
 had
 a
 amazing
 earnings.
 They


said
 the
 consumer
 is
 fine.


Like
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 are


kind
 of
 being
 a
 little
 moody
 going
 into


the
 JPAL
 meeting.


But
 like
 why
 the
 hell
 is
 Uber
 down?
 Like


[laughter]


in
 what
 world
 does
 Uber
 deserve
 to
 be


down
 4%
 right
 now?


I
 guess.
 Okay,
 so
 you
 had
 Citizens
 come


out
 investment
 firm.
 They
 said,
 "We
 see


some
 risk
 from
 autonomous
 vehicles."
 I


mean,
 that
 narrative
 is
 just
 old
 at
 this


point.
 Like,
 if
 you
 really
 think


robotagers
 are
 going to
 kill
 Uber,
 then


you
 sell
 Uber.
 But
 like,


it
 hasn't
 killed
 Uber
 yet.
 Maybe
 it
 does


in
 the
 future,


but
 it's
 not
 been
 in
 the
 numbers
 for
 the


past
 four
 years.


So,
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 we
 would
 expect


that
 to
 continue,
 but
 no
 price
 target.


They're
 just
 concerned
 about
 uh


concerned
 about
 ABS.
 Raikut
 gets


announced
 at
 2
 p.m.
 2
 p.m.
 Eastern.
 We


will
 know
 if
 we
 get
 this
 ray
 cut.
 S&P


low
 of
 the
 day
 as
 well.
 68190.


68190.
 Marta
 Libre
 also
 down
 5%.


I
 rent
 is
 down
 as
 well.


Laura
 said,
 "I
 sold
 my
 mom's
 Mercedes
 at


13."
 That
 is
 crazy.
 You
 guys
 have
 some


wild
 driving
 stories.


Like
 wild.
 [laughter]
 13
 years
 old,


stealing
 your
 parents'
 cars.


Again,
 I
 was
 afraid
 of
 driving,
 so
 I


never
 had
 that
 issue,


but
 I
 don't
 know
 at
 13
 if
 I
 would
 have


got
 behind
 the
 wheel.


TSM
 is
 that
 down
 today.
 Yeah,
 the
 market


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 for
 those
 that
 are
 saying


the
 market's
 nervous.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean


definitely
 TSM
 actually
 up
 a
 little
 bit.


[sighs]
 Can't
 deny
 the
 market's
 probably


a
 little
 scared
 right
 here
 going
 into
 a


hawkish
 cut.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 if
 JPAL
 comes


out
 and
 says,
 "Hey,
 we
 cut,
 but
 we're


going
 to
 be
 signaling
 a
 pause
 in
 the


future."
 Then
 the
 problem
 is
 I
 wonder
 I


wonder
 if
 the
 market's
 like,
 "Hey,
 we're


we're
 we're
 willing
 to
 give
 the
 S&P
 500


a
 premium,"
 which
 I
 think
 is
 trading
 at


like
 25
 times
 right
 now.
 But
 to
 get
 to


that
 7,000,
 it's
 got
 to
 trade
 at
 like
 27


times,
 26.9
 times,
 something
 like
 that.


We're
 not
 willing
 to
 give
 it
 that
 much


of
 a
 premium
 if
 we
 don't
 see
 more
 easing


in
 the
 next
 like
 four
 or
 five
 months,


which
 is
 what
 JPL
 might
 end
 like
 he
 I


mean,
 the
 last
 cut
 was
 pretty
 hawkish,


too.
 He
 got
 up
 there
 and
 he
 said,
 "Don't


expect
 a
 December
 cut."
 He
 was
 like


being
 very
 explicit
 about
 that


terminology.
 And
 all
 of
 us
 were
 like,


"Bro,
 like
 why
 are
 you
 like,
 all
 right,


we
 get
 it.
 Like
 we'll
 deal
 with
 that


when
 we
 deal
 with
 it,
 but
 why
 are
 you


signaling
 it
 right
 now?"
 And
 that
 was


his
 way
 of
 saying,
 hey,
 like
 don't
 get


too
 happy.


If
 the
 same
 thing
 happens
 here,


then


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 the


markets
 are
 going
 to
 be
 okay
 with


navigating
 it.


But
 on
 the
 opposite
 side,
 if
 everyone's


bearish
 there,
 then
 maybe
 that
 that
 gets


you
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 bullish.
 Uh,
 we


have
 an
 update
 right
 here.
 The
 Sandbox


CEO
 is
 about
 Nvidia
 AI
 chips
 to
 China.


Let's
 get
 his
 perspective
 on
 this
 and


see


what
 he
 thinks.
 They
 also
 partnered
 with


the
 Pentagon
 today,
 which
 is
 why
 they're


live.


>> Fact,
 the
 founder
 of
 Deepseek
 uh
 was
 one


of the
 big
 winners
 and
 investors
 in
 that


company.
 there's
 an
 ecosystem
 there
 that


is
 now
 betting
 on
 domestic
 Chinese
 chip


firms
 such
 as
 Huawei,
 more
 threads,


Cambercon
 and
 others
 uh
 to
 win
 in
 that


game.
 So
 we
 want
 to
 also
 make
 sure
 that


we
 in
 the
 US
 with
 our
 firms
 like
 Nvidia


and
 others
 have
 a
 level
 playing
 field
 to


access
 all
 markets
 around
 the
 world.
 So


there's
 definitely
 a
 balance
 there.
 But


coming
 back
 to
 China
 on
 another
 front,


uh
 one
 of
 the
 areas
 that
 the
 Pentagon
 is


very
 concerned
 about
 is
 the
 quantum


attack
 from
 China
 as
 well.
 So
 we
 have


the
 AI
 attack
 using
 Genai
 as
 a
 vector
 uh


for
 infiltration
 into
 US
 companies
 and


into
 sensitive
 areas
 of
 the
 Pentagon.
 Uh


we
 need
 to
 protect
 against
 that.
 That's


what
 we're
 doing
 now
 with
 Active
 Guard.


And
 we
 also
 need
 to
 protect
 against
 the


upcoming
 quantum
 attack.
 The
 Q
 day
 is


coming
 up
 uh
 in
 the
 next
 number
 of


years.
 And
 that's
 the
 day
 that
 uh


Chinese
 quantum
 computers
 can
 start
 to


deconstruct
 and
 get
 into
 RSA
 and
 other


encrypted
 material.


>> Wow.


You
 got
 a
 quantum
 argument
 around
 why


the
 US
 needs
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 more


sophisticated
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 dealing


with
 the
 threat
 of
 quantum.


>> RSA
 is
 what
 the
 Pentagon
 and
 all
 US


companies
 use
 to
 encrypt
 material
 to


transmit
 confidential
 information
 across


the
 internet.
 This
 goes
 down
 with
 the


advent
 of
 uh
 and
 rise
 of
 scaled
 quantum


computers.
 So
 two
 attacks
 AI
 and


differently
 quantum
 as
 well


>> right
 uh
 Jack
 over
 the
 weekend
 it
 was


Saxo
 Bank
 that
 had
 their
 list
 of
 2026


they
 call
 them
 outrageous
 predictions


but
 one
 of
 them
 was
 that
 QA
 would
 arrive


next
 year.
 Bank
 accounts
 they
 write


emails
 digital
 wallets
 are
 no
 longer


encrypted
 which
 leads
 to
 the
 collapse
 of


Bitcoin
 unquote.
 Is
 that
 too
 early?


>> Uh,
 well,
 they
 put
 it
 in
 their
 claims


and
 and
 I
 know
 that,
 but
 uh,
 Qday
 is


definitely
 coming.
 Is
 it
 coming
 next


year?
 Probably
 not.
 I
 wouldn't
 agree


with
 that
 timing,
 but
 is
 it
 coming
 in


the
 next
 few
 years?
 Yes,
 it
 is
 clear.


The
 Chinese
 have
 made
 it
 clear.
 They're


not
 hiding
 it,
 Carl.
 It
 is
 in
 their


plans,
 and
 they
 make
 very
 clear


milestone
 developments
 and


accomplishments
 towards
 Qday.
 They
 have


a
 very,
 very
 strong
 program
 under


Panjane,
 a
 very
 well-known
 physicist.


They
 have
 more
 than
 a
 thousand
 people


working
 on
 this
 issue
 on
 this
 Manhattan


project
 to
 create
 a
 quantum
 computer


that
 cracks
 the
 cyber
 security
 that
 we


all
 use
 every
 single
 day.
 Uh
 when
 you're


on
 WhatsApp,
 Carl,
 and
 it
 says
 encrypted


end
 to
 end,
 that
 encryption
 is
 the
 one


that
 will
 go
 down.
 Not
 to
 mention
 the


Swift
 system,
 not
 to
 mention
 the
 banking


system,
 the
 telco
 system,
 the
 electric


grid,
 and
 of
 course,
 back
 to
 the


Pentagon.
 our
 story
 today
 protecting
 the


Pentagon
 against
 those
 quantum
 attacks.


So,
 um
 I
 appreciate
 the
 Zaxo
 Bank


putting
 it
 out
 there,
 but
 it's
 coming
 up


very
 soon.
 And
 here's
 the
 point,
 Carl.


Here's
 the
 serious
 point
 that
 it
 takes
 a


while
 to
 transfer
 to
 the
 new
 uh
 cyber


security
 that
 protects
 against
 quantum


attack.
 Uh
 the
 Pentagon
 to
 its
 credit


has
 been
 now
 working
 on
 this
 issue
 and


now
 uh
 just
 in
 the
 last
 month
 has
 now


adopted
 active
 guard
 our
 software
 which


protects
 it
 against
 this.
 But
 we
 now


need
 the
 hundreds
 of
 large
 companies
 and


SMBs
 to
 also
 move
 to
 the
 new
 postquantum


standards
 that
 were
 issued
 by
 NISK.
 just


>> I
 mean
 look
 that
 argument
 that
 he
 just


said
 in
 and
 of
 itself
 is
 part
 of
 the


reason
 why
 the
 quantum
 names
 have
 been


holding
 on
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 their
 momentum.
 I


mean
 ju
 just
 the
 chance
 that
 what
 he's


saying
 is
 correct
 even
 if
 the


probability
 is
 low
 means
 that
 the


quantum
 stocks
 are
 going
 to
 catch
 a
 bit


and
 that
 the
 quantum
 stocks
 are
 likely


going
 to
 be
 more
 important
 than
 not.


Quite
 interesting
 though
 making
 that


argument
 especially
 in
 the
 context
 of


China.
 His
 concern
 is
 not
 even
 about
 the


the
 blackwell
 chips.
 His
 concern
 is
 more


about
 China
 quantum
 and
 the
 investments


they're
 making
 there
 affecting
 the


United
 States.
 Carvana
 right
 they're
 up


1.2%.
 Nvidia
 still
 down
 now
 officially


low
 of
 day
 1%


at
 183


as
 that
 one
 continues
 to
 go
 red.


All right
 folks
 let's
 bring
 someone
 on


to
 the
 show
 today.
 Um
 some
 of
 you
 guys


have
 heard
 the
 Twitter
 spaces
 I
 did
 with


him.
 I
 think
 about
 seven
 months
 ago
 I


was
 on
 there
 with
 Iliano
 and
 Chad
 and


we're
 going
 to
 get
 into
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff


today.
 Again,
 the
 big
 headline
 from


yesterday
 for
 those
 that
 missed
 it,
 the


US
 Navy
 has
 announced
 a
 448
 million


2-year
 deal
 with
 Palinger
 in
 an


investment
 in
 the
 ship
 building


operating
 system
 ship
 OS.
 Ship
 OS
 will


leverage
 Palanteer
 software
 to
 bring


modern
 best
 practices
 to
 the
 complex


data
 heavy
 environment
 of
 Navy
 ship


building.
 Let's
 bring
 on
 the
 head
 of


energy
 and
 natural
 resources
 at


Palunteer,
 Mr.
 Matt
 Babin.
 Matt,
 thanks


for
 being
 on.


>> Hey,
 great
 to
 see
 you
 again.


>> So,
 it
 has
 been
 a
 while
 since
 we
 talked.


I
 think
 it
 was
 seven
 months
 ago
 around


that
 uh
 March,
 April
 time.
 A
 lot
 has


changed
 for
 Pounder.
 First
 of
 all,


congratulations
 on
 all
 the
 success
 of


the
 company.
 Before
 we
 get
 into
 the
 ship


OS
 deal
 that
 was
 announced
 yesterday,


um,
 generally
 just
 what
 has
 the
 last


seven
 months
 been
 like
 for
 you
 as
 you've


been
 navigating
 the
 energy
 part
 of


business?


>> Uh,
 it's
 been
 it's
 been
 busy.
 Um,
 and
 I


I'd
 say
 I've
 been
 splitting
 time
 between


between
 that
 work
 and
 and
 the
 Navy
 work.


Um,
 and
 and
 really
 spending
 more
 and


more
 time
 on
 the
 Navy
 work
 uh
 recently


and
 moving
 forward.
 Um,
 they're


they're
 more
 similar
 than
 you'd
 think.


Um,
 you
 know,
 they're
 both
 very


they're
 very
 highly
 regulated
 areas,


right?
 There's
 a
 lot
 of,
 you
 know,


subsafe
 certification
 is,
 you
 know,


incredibly
 complex.
 Um,
 each
 submarine
 a


submarine
 takes,
 you
 know,
 tens
 of


millions
 of
 labor
 hours.
 An
 aircraft


carrier
 has
 a
 billion
 parts
 that
 go
 into


it.
 So
 20,000
 ft
 underground
 and
 complex


environments
 where
 things
 have
 to
 work


is
 is
 very
 similar
 to,
 you
 know,
 here's


a
 here's
 a
 submersible
 that's
 two


football
 fields
 long
 um
 and
 it
 needs
 to


be
 built
 faster
 but
 with
 not


compromising
 anything
 on
 on
 you
 know


safety
 and
 and
 it
 needs
 to
 work
 then
 for


50
 years.
 Um
 so
 that
 they're
 they're


actually
 similar
 [laughter]
 in
 a
 strange


way.
 So,
 let's
 get
 into
 uh
 ship
 OS.
 Now,


I
 think
 my
 audience
 and
 anyone
 who's


really
 followed
 Pounder
 over
 the
 past


couple
 years
 understands
 that
 ship


building
 is
 something
 the
 company
 has


cared
 about
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 The
 Hyandai


Heavy
 Industries
 deal
 uh
 was
 basically


executing
 on
 this
 future
 of
 shipyard


vision
 in
 South
 Korea.
 It
 seems
 like


that's
 now
 coming
 to
 the
 Navy.
 So,
 I


guess
 what
 was
 the
 part
 that
 led
 to
 this


deal?
 And
 I
 guess
 why
 do
 you
 think
 the


Navy
 ended
 up
 picking
 Pounder
 to


implement
 ship
 OS?
 Yeah.
 So,
 we've
 been


doing
 this
 work
 um
 for
 the
 last
 few


months
 um
 under
 some
 some
 proof
 of


concepts
 with
 with
 a
 private
 ship


builder
 um
 with
 a
 public
 shipyard
 uh


with
 you
 know
 just
 under
 10
 10


suppliers.
 Um
 and
 I
 think
 you're
 right


to
 call
 out
 this
 is
 it's
 a
 similar


workflow
 to
 some
 of
 the
 Hyundai
 work.
 Um


you
 know
 the
 the
 Navy
 has
 uh
 has
 gone


and
 and
 seen
 some
 of
 that
 work.
 Um
 it's


it's
 a
 big
 world
 but
 it's
 a
 small


community
 that
 builds
 ships
 of
 this
 sort


of
 size
 and
 complexity.
 Um
 and
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 infrastructure
 of
 the
 supply


chain
 of
 of
 things
 like
 submarines
 or


other
 other
 large
 things
 like
 this
 it
 it


does
 look
 again
 I'll
 just
 draw
 on
 the


energy
 analogy
 because
 we've
 talked


about
 that
 a
 lot
 before.
 You
 know
 the


work
 with
 BP
 sort
 of
 started
 with
 this


vision
 that
 Mr.
 Dudley
 had
 of
 I
 want
 to


chase
 a
 molecule
 from
 the
 sand
 face
 all


the
 way
 through
 to
 the
 export
 terminal


or
 where
 I
 monetize
 this.
 And
 that
 pulls


in
 a
 reservoir
 model
 that
 pulls
 in
 the


way
 I
 operate
 my
 drilling
 campaigns,
 the


way
 I
 operate
 my
 wells,
 my
 offshore


assets,
 my
 midstream
 and
 transportation,


my
 refineries,
 my
 commercial
 fuels
 and


marketing.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at
 sort
 of


all
 of
 the
 steps
 that
 go
 into
 building
 a


submarine,
 right?
 It's
 I
 have
 a
 supply


chain
 of
 thousands
 of
 different


companies
 spread
 all
 around
 the
 country,


all
 of
 them
 make
 different
 parts
 and


pieces.
 Those
 pieces
 come
 into
 uh


construction
 by
 other
 suppliers.
 Those


pieces
 then
 come
 into
 a
 module.
 Those


modules
 turn
 into
 super
 modules
 and
 that


those
 super
 modules
 turn
 into
 the
 boat.


And
 so
 this
 idea
 of
 I
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to


securely
 share
 data
 up
 and
 down
 that


chain
 all
 the
 way
 up
 to
 the
 Navy
 that


looks
 a
 lot
 like
 Maven
 on
 sort
 of


individual
 commanders
 up
 to
 COCOMs
 up
 to


the
 to
 the
 department.
 Um
 this
 idea
 of
 I


need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 flexibly
 solve
 a


diverse
 set
 of
 problems
 across
 that


supply
 chain.
 Um
 individual
 suppliers


have
 different
 bottlenecks,
 right?
 These


are
 different
 companies
 uh
 of
 different


sizes
 that
 do
 different
 things
 and
 and


so
 I
 think
 what
 was
 attractive
 in
 the


pilot
 work
 we
 did
 and
 sort
 of
 the
 proof


of
 value
 was
 time
 to
 target
 how
 how


quickly
 can
 you
 show
 value
 of
 the


software
 the
 flexibility
 of
 the
 workflow


application.
 So
 what
 what
 is
 the
 actual


problem
 we're
 solving
 for
 an
 individual


human
 who's
 oftentimes
 on
 the
 floor
 not


in
 an
 office.
 Um,
 and
 then
 how
 do
 you


match
 that
 flexibility
 with
 a
 canonical


underlying
 data
 model
 so
 that
 the
 Navy


can
 actually
 look
 at
 the
 thing
 they
 care


about,
 which
 is
 is
 the
 boat
 going
 to
 get


delivered
 faster
 or
 not.


>> I
 think
 what's
 really
 exciting
 about


this
 is
 that
 we've
 seen
 Pounder
 take


over
 a
 variety
 of
 industries
 and
 become


like
 a
 deacto
 operating
 system.
 And
 as


you're
 mentioning,
 you
 have
 vendors,
 you


have
 distributors,
 you
 have
 suppliers,


you
 have
 subsupliers,
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of


these
 different
 things
 that
 need
 to
 be


interconnected
 with
 each
 other
 in
 order


to
 make
 it
 actually
 work
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day.
 Not
 to
 mention
 the
 complexity


of
 managing
 a
 submarine.
 Uh,
 is
 that
 how


you're
 seeing
 the
 future
 of
 ship
 OS?
 Is


it
 just
 going
 to
 become
 a
 deacto


operating
 system
 that
 you
 think
 can
 be


the
 basis
 for
 how
 the
 United
 States
 Navy


operates
 in
 the
 process
 of
 ship


building?


>> I
 think
 it
 could
 and
 I
 think
 that
 again


the
 sort
 of
 openness
 and
 extensibility


of
 the
 platform
 is
 is
 a
 valuable
 thing


here
 too,
 right?
 Right.
 I
 mean,
 if
 again


just
 just
 use
 Maven
 smart
 system
 as
 the


analogy,
 Maven
 was
 built
 originally
 with


the
 idea
 of
 you're
 going
 to
 plug
 in


detection
 models
 that
 that
 we
 do
 not


build
 and
 that
 we
 may
 never
 see,
 right?


And
 so
 if
 you
 look
 at
 lots
 of
 other


pieces
 of
 building
 a
 complicated
 piece


of,
 you
 know,
 deployment
 infrastructure,


let's
 call
 it
 like
 a
 submarine.
 There


are
 parts
 of
 that
 that
 that
 we
 will


never
 build
 models
 or
 systems
 for.
 Um


there's
 other
 scheduling
 software,


there's
 other
 modeling
 software,
 there's


radiographic
 testing,
 and
 the
 ability


for
 the
 Navy
 to
 then
 use
 this
 as
 an


orchestration
 layer
 the
 way
 we
 see
 other


companies
 uh
 and
 other
 institutions


doing
 that
 I
 think
 is
 um
 is
 something


that
 I'm
 excited
 about
 building
 moving


forward.


>> Uh
 you
 talked
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the


complexities
 of
 of
 working
 with
 the
 US


Navy
 and
 getting
 this
 done.
 I
 think
 last


time
 we
 talked
 BP
 had
 just
 signed
 their


extension
 navigating
 a
 large
 scale


partnership
 with
 a
 very
 large


organization
 that
 is
 managing
 um
 massive


massive
 levels
 of
 confidential
 data.
 How


has
 that
 process
 been
 like
 to
 actually


get
 the
 Navy
 to
 give
 you
 guys
 the
 trust


to
 be
 able
 to
 ultimately
 implement
 an


entire
 operating
 system?


>> Yeah.
 Um
 it's
 a
 good
 question.
 Again,
 I


think
 you
 know
 I've
 I've
 been
 here
 a


while.
 Um
 we
 when
 I
 joined
 we
 only
 had
 a


government
 business.
 So
 we
 we
 really
 did


sort
 of
 cut
 our
 teeth
 on
 building
 a


platform
 that
 could
 securely
 hold


classified
 data.
 And
 then
 all
 along
 the


way
 we
 we've
 gone
 to
 okay
 well
 what
 does


it
 take
 to
 then
 get
 an
 IL6
 certification


to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that
 in
 the
 cloud,


right?
 What
 does
 that
 look
 like
 on
 Fed


Ramp
 to
 for
 other
 people
 to
 be
 able
 to


build
 software
 that
 they
 can
 deploy
 into


secure
 spaces?
 Um
 the
 the
 Navy's
 version


of
 this
 that's
 that's
 relevant
 for


submarines
 is
 is
 NNPI,
 right?
 Um
 there's


public
 information
 about
 this
 out
 there


on
 you
 know
 naval
 nuclear
 propulsion


information.
 Um
 and
 so
 similar
 to
 to


other
 work
 we've
 had
 to
 prove
 how
 the


platform
 can
 hold
 data
 there
 how
 we
 can


enforce
 that
 um
 on
 on
 everything
 along


the
 way.
 Again
 like
 everything
 else
 and


and
 you
 know
 this
 I
 know
 but
 um


the
 the
 data
 the
 data
 remains
 the


property
 of
 of
 the
 data
 owner
 right?
 Um


and
 and
 so
 what
 we're
 doing
 is
 um
 sort


of
 enforcing
 the
 regulations
 the
 Navy


has
 set
 on
 the
 way
 data
 can
 be
 shared


from
 Navy
 requirements
 down
 to
 suppliers


who
 who
 build
 those
 pieces
 and
 from


those
 suppliers
 back
 up
 to
 to
 the
 Navy


including
 uh
 data
 that's
 that's


sensitive.


>> Uh
 I'm
 sure
 there's
 an
 answer
 to
 this.


Um
 it
 might
 be
 a
 general
 answer
 more


specific
 answer
 but
 AI
 you
 know


everyone's
 wondering
 about
 how
 that
 is


intercorrelate
 with
 all
 this
 stuff
 is


this
 just
 AI
 as
 a
 workflow
 as
 a
 sort
 of


enterprise
 workflow
 gets
 automated
 in
 a


very
 specific
 use
 case
 for
 ship
 building


as
 an
 operating
 system.
 Yeah,
 what
 we've


started
 doing,
 I
 mean,
 the
 the
 work
 over


the
 past
 few
 months
 with
 the
 pilot
 is


really,
 you
 know,
 what
 what
 came
 through


to
 me
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 suppliers
 are


are
 relatively


I'm
 going
 to
 say
 they're
 small
 in


comparison
 to
 the
 Navy,
 right?
 I
 mean,


you're
 you're
 talking
 about
 a
 couple


hundred
 employees.
 Um,
 they're
 all
 over


the
 place
 and
 and
 they're
 really
 really


good
 at
 what
 they
 do,
 right?
 Like
 these


these
 are
 companies
 that
 have
 done
 the


same
 thing
 for
 decades
 and
 they
 are


craftsmen
 of
 craftsmen
 and
 women
 of
 the


highest
 order
 of
 of
 doing
 like
 really


really
 hard
 work
 in
 in
 places
 that
 are


120
 degrees
 in
 the
 summer
 and
 freezing


cold
 in
 the
 winter
 cuz
 the
 bays
 have
 to


be
 open
 for
 you
 know
 circulation
 and
 and


all
 of
 this
 stuff.
 Um
 and
 what
 you
 see


in
 a
 lot
 of
 places
 is
 that
 the
 people


who
 are
 best
 at
 the
 technical
 parts
 of


that
 job
 also
 know
 the
 most
 about
 their


company.
 That's
 not
 unique
 to
 to
 ship


building
 and
 manufacturing
 that
 you
 see


that
 everywhere,
 right?
 But
 if
 you
 pull


your
 best
 welder
 off
 a
 line
 to
 build
 a


schedule
 and
 the
 way
 they
 have
 to
 build


that
 schedule
 is
 manual
 based
 on


paperwork
 orders
 and
 what
 they
 call


travelers
 and
 then
 an
 adjustment
 of
 who


shows
 up
 for
 work
 that
 day
 or
 who


doesn't,
 that's
 all
 time
 that
 that


person
 isn't
 welding.
 If
 you
 can


automate
 that
 schedule
 building
 process


so
 that
 that
 welder
 doesn't
 have
 to


build
 a
 schedule
 and
 they
 can
 just


verify,
 yes,
 that
 schedule
 makes
 sense.


That
 schedule
 makes
 sense
 on
 the


requirements
 I
 have
 from
 the
 Navy.
 That


schedule
 makes
 sense
 in
 terms
 of
 this


work
 is
 very
 high
 complexity
 and
 can


only
 be
 done
 by
 these
 two
 people.
 It


makes
 sense
 in
 terms
 of
 I'm
 not
 slotting


two
 things
 at
 the
 same
 fixture,
 the
 same


physical
 space
 in
 in
 my
 facility.
 Right?


So
 what
 we
 really
 saw
 in
 the
 pilot
 was


AI
 and
 automation
 for
 all
 of
 these


things
 that
 take
 your
 highv
 value


high-skll
 workers
 off
 the
 line
 of
 doing


the
 jobs
 they
 want
 to
 do
 and
 give
 them


more
 time
 back
 to
 do
 that.
 And
 that's


where
 I
 think
 you
 see
 in
 the
 Navy
 press


release
 some
 of
 sort
 of
 you
 know
 taking


160
 hours
 down
 to
 10
 minutes


that
 gives
 you
 then
 you
 know
 four
 work


days
 to
 bend
 metal
 in
 instead
 of
 look


for
 data
 and
 and
 go
 do
 things
 right.
 Uh


and
 so
 the
 first
 application
 of
 AI
 in


this
 has
 been
 how
 do
 we
 automate
 these


parts
 of
 the
 job
 that
 that
 no
 one
 really


wants
 to
 do
 and
 have
 gotten
 bigger
 and


bigger
 and
 bigger
 over
 time
 because
 of


the
 sort
 of
 proliferation
 of
 different


systems
 and
 different
 processes
 and


regulations.
 So
 let's
 still
 get
 all
 of


the
 data
 from
 those
 places.
 Let's
 still


do
 that
 work,
 but
 let's
 actually
 build


rather
 than
 a
 human
 taking
 dozens
 of


hours
 to
 build
 a
 manual
 schedule,
 let's


automatically
 build
 eight
 schedules
 and


have
 that
 human
 evaluate
 which
 one
 makes


the
 most
 sense
 today,
 lock
 that
 in
 and


then
 and
 then
 get
 to
 work
 welding
 again.


Beyond
 that,
 then
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to


see
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 how
 do
 you
 coordinate


between
 those
 different
 nodes,
 right?


So,
 you
 start
 with
 sort
 of
 at
 each


chain,
 how
 at
 each
 part
 of
 the
 chain,


how
 that
 makes
 sense.
 But
 then,
 you


know,
 if
 you
 make
 pieces
 that
 come
 to


me,
 I
 want
 to
 know
 if
 you're
 changing


your
 schedule
 so
 that
 I
 can
 prepare
 for


the
 pieces
 you're
 going
 to
 send
 to
 me


and
 then
 the
 ship
 builder
 knows
 what


they're
 going to
 get
 from
 me
 at
 what


schedule.


>> I
 love
 it.
 Matt
 Babin,
 thank
 you
 for


joining
 the
 show.
 I'm
 putting
 Matt's


Twitter
 in
 the
 chat
 if
 anyone
 wants
 to


follow
 him
 there
 and
 you
 can
 follow
 him


on
 X.
 Uh,
 last
 question
 for
 you,
 Matt.


Again,
 thank
 you
 for
 taking
 the
 time
 to


do
 this.
 I
 got
 to
 ask
 this
 because
 my


audience
 uh
 loved
 when
 I
 ask
 this


question
 at
 the
 end
 of
 every
 show.
 Uh


super
 random,
 but
 it'll
 humanize
 you
 a


little
 bit
 for
 everybody.
 What's
 your


favorite
 movie?


>> Oh,


um


I'll
 say
 favorite
 holiday
 movie
 because


it's
 in
 my
 head.
 Uh
 is
 is
 Home
 Alone.
 Um


I
 think
 Home
 Alone
 is
 excellent.


>> Uh
 one
 one


>> I'm
 a
 two
 guy.
 I'm
 a
 two
 guy.
 I
 like


two.
 All right.
 I
 like
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 has
 that
 has
 that
 been
 like
 a
 child


nostalgic
 type
 of
 movie
 for
 you?


>> Um,
 it
 is.
 And
 I
 think
 then
 um
 as
 you


grow
 up
 as
 a
 parent,
 it
 takes
 on
 a
 whole


different
 meaning.


[laughter]


>> All
 right.
 I
 love
 it.
 Matthew,
 thanks
 so


much
 for
 being
 on
 the
 show.
 And
 we'll


see
 you
 again.


>> Later.


>> All
 right.
 Home
 Alone.
 Dude,
 Home
 Alone


2
 legit
 is
 I
 was
 talking
 about
 this
 I


think
 two
 weeks
 ago.


That
 is
 like
 I
 think
 objectively
 a
 top


five
 Christmas
 movie.
 Um,


so
 yeah,
 I'm
 a
 Home
 Alone
 2
 guy.
 Home


Alone
 one
 is
 legit,
 but
 Home
 Alone
 2,


Dude,
 Home
 Alone
 2
 is
 New
 York.
 Aid
 has


never
 watched
 one.
 What
 are
 you
 talking


about?
 Of
 course
 I've
 seen
 Home
 Alone
 2


is
 one
 of
 the
 first
 movies
 I
 think
 I
 saw


as
 a
 kid
 while
 the
 S&P
 goes
 red
 and


Nvidia
 new
 low
 of
 a
 day.
 Why
 do
 they


hate
 Nvidia?


Nvidia
 is
 the
 reason
 for
 all
 of
 this


momentum
 in
 the
 past
 three
 years.


Freaking
 beat
 earnings
 by
 60%.
 They


can't
 let
 her
 win.
 Goodness
 gracious.


Once
 again,
 Redit


will
 watch
 it
 tonight.
 You
 guys
 are


funny.
 But
 Home
 Alone
 2
 is
 uh
 I
 think
 an


objectively
 amazing
 Christmas
 movie.


Wow.
 Netflix.
 When's
 the
 last
 time
 it


got
 to
 these
 lows?
 9478.


last.
 Oh,
 a
 six-month
 low.


Is
 this
 a
 six-month
 low?
 This
 is
 Last


time
 we
 got
 here
 was
 April
 2025.
 We
 are


approaching
 Liberation
 Day.
 Liberation


Day
 it
 bottomed
 at
 82.
 So,
 we're
 not


fully
 there
 yet.
 Goodness.
 April
 prices


on
 freaking
 Netflix.
 Nabi
 is
 right
 there


down
 2.9.
 Meta
 goes
 down
 1.2.
 Microsoft


down
 almost
 three.
 Uber
 down
 five.
 S&P


goes
 red.
 Hoodie's
 probably
 getting
 hit.


Hoodie.
 Yep,
 that's
 down
 half
 a
 percent.


And
 then
 Palunteer,


that's
 holding
 up
 at
 184.
 [snorts]


Why
 do
 they
 hate
 Nvidia?
 I
 don't
 get
 it.


Call
 Vlad.
 Tell
 them
 to
 take
 the
 sell


button
 off
 of
 Nvidia.
 [gasps]


I
 got
 rid
 of
 all
 my
 short
 calls
 on


Nvidia,
 by
 the
 way.
 I
 tweeted
 about
 this


on
 Monday.
 I
 have
 no
 more
 short
 calls
 on


video.
 No
 covered
 calls
 at
 174.


Ironically,
 on
 the
 day
 I
 was
 driving
 to


the
 dentist,
 um
 there
 was
 like
 some


traffic
 and
 I
 literally
 just
 I
 bought


all
 them
 back.
 Like
 it
 was
 a
 it
 was
 a


very
 like
 spontaneous
 decision,
 but
 I


was
 like,
 "Dude,
 if
 Nvidia
 is
 at
 this


level
 and
 these
 calls
 have
 generated


enough
 theta
 decay
 because
 I
 I I
 I


rolled
 them
 out
 back
 in
 like


freaking
 what
 July,
 August,
 and
 the


stock
 is
 down
 from
 those
 levels
 like
 and


I'm
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 profit
 on


buying
 back
 these
 calls.
 like
 I
 I'll


leave
 these
 shares
 naked
 and
 let
 this


thing
 run.
 And
 I
 mean,
 we
 got
 a
 run
 from


170
 to
 185,
 but
 the
 question
 is,
 can
 we


get
 a
 run
 back
 up
 to
 200?


And
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 180
 275


that's
 down
 1.2%.


Isn't
 this
 the
 fake
 move
 before
 the


FOMC?
 Yes,
 technically
 that's
 true.


Honestly,
 when
 JPA's
 talking,
 all
 of


that's
 going
 to
 be
 fake.
 And
 I
 know


we're
 going
 to
 get
 super
 excited
 if


we're
 pumping.
 I'll
 be
 super
 excited
 as


well,
 but
 like
 it's
 not
 real.
 And
 if


we're
 dumping,
 we
 just
 have
 to
 remember


it's
 not
 real.
 3:30
 to
 4
 p.m.,
 those


final
 30
 minutes
 is
 when


we
 see
 how
 the
 market's
 actually


thinking
 about
 it.


10
 years
 down
 a
 little
 bit,
 so
 that's


good.
 At least
 if
 the
 market's
 down.
 And


again,
 I'm
 being
 hyperbolic
 on
 Nvidia


right
 here,
 but
 realistically,


when
 JPAL
 talks,
 we're
 going
 to
 know


what
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.


All right,
 I
 guess
 we
 are
 red
 heading


into


the
 FMC
 now.
 I
 actually
 like
 that,
 and


I'm
 sure
 other
 people
 like
 that
 more


than
 ripping
 green
 because
 that's
 just


setting
 us
 up
 for
 disappointment.


So,
 I'll
 be
 back
 in
 two
 hours.
 uh
 2:20


p.m.
 Eastern,
 I'll
 be
 live.
 2
 p.m.
 we'll


get
 the
 decision.
 Most
 likely
 will
 be
 a


cut.
 If
 we
 don't,
 you'll
 know
 about
 it.


You
 won't
 even
 have
 to
 check
 my
 Twitter.


You'll
 you'll
 see
 the
 portfolio
 react


pretty
 quickly.


But
 [snorts]


at
 2:30,
 we're
 going
 to
 officially
 know


what
 ends
 up
 happening


and
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


Could
 you
 please
 buy
 VG
 here?


>> [snorts]


>> Dude,
 I
 really
 just
 if
 I
 buy
 this
 thing,


it's
 literally
 just
 trusting
 Chris
 and


Matt.
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 enough
 about
 this.


I
 know
 the
 one
 thing
 I
 know
 I've
 heard


them
 speak
 about
 is
 that
 their
 free
 cash


flow
 in
 like
 5
 to
 10
 years
 is
 going
 to


be
 ridiculous,
 which
 they're
 probably


right
 about,
 especially
 Matt
 because
 he


understands
 oil
 and
 gas
 really
 well
 and


he's
 like
 super
 bullish
 on
 it.


But,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 just
 I
 would
 need
 to


separate
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 money
 and
 just


buy
 it
 and
 not
 look
 at
 it.
 If
 I
 buy
 a


name
 like
 that
 that
 I
 genuinely
 have
 a


long-term
 horizon
 on
 and
 I'm
 not
 looking


at
 the
 day-to-day
 like
 I
 really
 like


this
 Robinet
 individual
 account
 thing


because
 I'm
 honestly
 I'm
 going
 to
 do


that
 next
 year
 with
 Bitcoin
 and
 the
 S&P.


I'm
 going
 to
 try
 to
 put
 some
 money
 into


them
 and
 just
 leave
 them
 in
 individual


accounts
 so
 I'm
 not
 even
 tempted
 to
 sell


them
 when
 they're
 stuck
 because
 more


often
 than
 not
 those
 stocks
 those


indices
 will
 stay
 stuck
 but
 the
 goal
 of


it
 is
 not
 to
 you
 know
 see
 an
 immediate


move.


So
 maybe
 VGs
 on
 those.
 I'm
 still
 working


on
 my
 2026
 portfolio
 update.
 Um,
 I
 have


a
 dude
 I
 have
 like
 four
 different


articles
 that
 I'm
 working
 on
 right
 now.


Real
 getting
 sick
 over
 the
 weekend
 kind


of.
 I
 was
 supposed
 to
 have
 the
 deep
 dive


come
 out
 over
 the
 weekend.
 I
 was


supposed
 to
 have
 my
 prediction
 markets


article
 come
 out
 over
 the
 weekend.
 I


tried
 writing
 a
 little
 bit
 on
 Saturday


and
 I
 just
 like
 I
 couldn't
 even
 stare
 at


a
 screen
 and
 type.
 So,
 if
 I
 didn't
 get


sick,
 you
 would
 have
 had
 like
 four
 or


five
 articles
 come
 out
 by
 Monday
 or


Tuesday.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 to
 get


those
 out
 this
 week.
 But
 2026
 portfolio


and
 how
 I'm
 thinking
 of
 like
 the


moonshots
 versus
 the
 cornerstones
 of
 the


portfolio
 versus
 like
 positions
 where


you
 kind
 of
 buy
 500
 shares
 and
 see
 what


happens
 and
 you
 attach
 conditions
 where


you
 you
 take
 your
 loss
 if
 it
 goes
 here


or
 you
 double
 down
 if
 it
 goes
 here.
 I'm


working
 on
 a
 on
 a
 really
 big
 article
 on


that.
 So,


and
 you
 guys
 already
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 my


thoughts.
 I
 mean,
 Meta,
 Amazon,
 Nvidia,


I
 think
 are
 probably
 your
 your
 best
 Mac


7
 longs,
 but
 I
 have
 some
 other
 names


that
 I'm
 kind
 of
 looking
 at
 into
 2026,


and


that'll
 all
 be
 on
 the
 the
 article
 as


well.


All right,
 that
 is
 it.
 Let's
 do
 word
 of


the
 day.
 We'll
 be
 back
 in
 two
 hours.
 All


of
 us
 will
 be
 obsessively
 focused
 on


a
 man
 and
 what
 he
 has
 to
 say
 about


interest
 rates,
 which
 none
 of
 our


friends
 or
 family


care
 about,
 but
 we
 do.


And
 it'll
 be
 fun
 because
 we're
 going
 to


be
 reacting
 dramatically
 either
 way.


Talk
 about
 this
 word
 of
 the
 day.
 This


better
 not
 be
 a
 sign.
 Chat
 GBT


drawd
 down
 a
 decline
 from
 peak
 in
 your


portfolio
 or
 strategy.
 The
 pain
 you


measure
 to
 understand
 risk.
 Your


prediction
 market
 strategy
 looks
 strong,


but
 one
 big
 draw
 down
 will
 reveal


whether
 the
 rules
 actually
 hold
 under


pressure.


Goodness,
 bro.


I
 mean,


prediction
 markets
 yesterday.
 Did
 you


guys
 see
 that
 video
 of
 the
 guy
 who
 was


literally
 uh
 live
 streaming
 himself
 when


Trump
 was
 speaking
 and
 his
 strategy
 on


the
 prediction
 markets
 was
 betting
 on


Bitcoin
 tariff.
 He
 was
 putting
 like


$1,000
 on
 every
 word.
 He
 knew
 some
 of


these
 words
 Trump
 wouldn't
 say,
 but
 the


ones
 that
 he
 did
 say,
 he
 would
 make
 like


seven
 $800
 on
 top
 of
 that.
 I
 don't
 know


if
 I
 saved
 the
 video.
 If
 I
 didn't,
 I'll


show
 it
 on
 the
 market
 close.
 This
 guy


was
 like
 literally
 going
 crazy
 after


every
 word
 Trump
 would
 say
 based
 on
 the


the
 prediction
 markets.


I
 don't
 know.
 Chat
 GBT
 better
 not
 be


signaling
 freaking
 draw
 down.
 It
 would


suck.
 It
 would
 suck
 going
 into
 the
 end


of
 the
 year
 because
 we
 just
 escaped
 the


nastiness
 of
 freaking


freaking
 uh
 November
 and
 we
 got
 through


it.
 I
 mean,
 I
 was
 talking
 about
 this


yesterday
 with
 Jason
 from
 from
 the
 lows


of
 November.
 My
 portfolio
 is
 up
 like


35%.
 Now
 granted,
 it
 was
 down
 a
 lot
 as


well.
 So
 that's
 why
 there's
 a
 massive


move
 up.
 But
 like,
 you
 know,
 we
 were


down
 a
 lot.
 We
 ended
 up
 getting
 somewhat


of
 a
 decent
 recovery.
 Stocks
 haven't


gone
 to
 their
 all-time
 highs,
 but
 you


know,
 Robin
 Hood's
 not
 at
 100.
 Pounder's


not
 at
 140
 anymore.


Nvidia
 is
 not,
 you
 know,
 stuck
 at
 170.


So
 Meta
 is
 not
 at
 585.
 So
 having
 that


reverse
 would
 be
 annoying.
 But
 again,


the
 reason
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 going
 to


reverse
 is
 because
 if
 the
 Fed
 is
 easing,


you've
 already
 got
 that
 intrinsically


baked
 in.
 And
 then
 this
 AI
 trade,
 you


know,
 the
 AI
 bubble
 stuff
 is
 there,
 but


it's
 definitely
 calmed
 down
 a
 bit
 over


the
 past
 couple
 weeks.
 Question
 is,
 if


that
 narrative
 heats
 up,
 and
 if
 that


narrative
 heats
 up
 again
 and
 we
 still


have
 good
 earnings,
 it
 becomes
 a
 buy
 the


dip.
 Problem
 is,
 if
 people
 are
 levered


and
 they
 have,
 you
 know,
 margin,
 they


might
 not
 be
 able
 to
 buy
 the
 dip,
 which


is
 exactly
 what
 happened
 in
 November.


So,


that's
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see


for
 these
 rate
 cuts
 in
 the
 next
 couple


hours.


All
 right,
 I'll
 be
 live.
 I'll
 be
 live
 in


two
 hours.
 90%
 of
 you
 think
 we're
 going


to
 get
 a
 cut.
 I
 agree
 as
 well.
 Question


now
 is
 is
 it
 priced
 in


and
 the
 fun
 of
 investing
 is
 we
 don't


know
 and
 we'll
 find
 out
 in
 two
 hours.


All
 right.
 Thanks
 everybody.
 I'll
 be


back
 at
 2:20
 p.m.
 I'll
 be
 live
 on


Twitter
 spaces
 at
 12:30
 with
 Stock
 Talk.


And
 so
 we'll
 do
 a
 Twitter
 spaces
 from


12:30
 to
 1
 and
 then
 at
 2:20
 I'll
 be
 live


2
 p.m.
 we'll
 get
 the
 decision
 and
 then


at
 2:30
 we
 will
 see
 what
 Jay
 Pal
 says.


Thank
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 I'll
 see


you
 guys
 in
 a
 few
 hours.
 Bye
 everyone.


Have
 a
 good
 one.
