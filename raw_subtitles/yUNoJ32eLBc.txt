Billions
 of
 dollars
 are
 spent
 spying
 on


Americans,
 whether
 it's
 NSA
 or
 CIA
 or


the
 FBI.
 And
 to
 make
 matters
 worse,
 we


know
 that
 the
 CIA
 can
 take
 control


remotely
 of
 a
 car's
 computer
 system
 in


order
 to
 crash
 the
 car,
 take
 it
 off
 a


bridge,
 or
 take
 control
 of
 your
 smart
 TV


and
 turn
 a
 speaker
 into
 a
 microphone,


>> even
 though
 the
 TV
 is
 off
 and
 broadcast


back
 to
 the
 CIA.


>> Can
 they
 do
 that
 with
 devices?


>> Absolutely.
 And
 I'll
 tell
 you
 how
 we


know.
 There
 was
 a
 CIA
 software
 engineer


who
 was
 disgruntled
 and
 he
 downloaded


tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 documents


classified
 above
 top
 secret
 and
 instead


of
 going
 to
 the
 Russians
 or
 the
 Chinese,


he
 went
 to
 Wikileaks
 and
 they
 became
 the


Vault
 7
 documents.
 So
 our
 whole
 lives


are
 out
 there
 potentially
 for
 someone
 to


use
 against
 us
 and
 every
 country
 has


these
 capabilities.
 Listen,
 I
 spent
 15


years
 in
 the
 CIA.
 I
 love
 this
 country,


but
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important
 things
 in


my
 life
 is
 the
 issue
 of
 ethics,
 which
 is


why
 I
 blew
 the
 whistle
 on
 the
 CIA's


torture
 program.
 Because
 my
 superiors


kept
 repeating
 that
 torture
 worked,
 but


besides
 being
 illegal,
 immoral,


unethical,
 it
 just
 wasn't
 true.
 And
 I


would
 let
 them
 send
 me
 to
 prison
 again


because
 it
 was
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 do.
 I


mean,
 we
 know
 that
 they
 were


experimenting
 on
 American
 citizens
 and


spreading
 diseases
 in
 American
 cities.


>> This
 is
 the
 stuff
 of
 movies.


>> It
 is.
 And
 because
 you've
 been
 in
 this


world
 that
 the
 average
 person
 really
 has


no
 idea
 about,
 I
 have
 to
 ask
 you,
 who
 do


you
 think
 is
 the
 real
 adversary
 of
 the


West,
 what
 are
 you
 most
 concerned
 about


in
 the
 world
 at
 the
 moment?
 And
 what


about
 everything
 that's
 going
 on
 with


Trump
 in
 Venezuela
 and
 Greenland?
 And


then,
 do
 you
 think
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 was
 a


spy?


>> Yes.


>> Who
 do
 you
 think
 he
 was
 working
 for?


>> The
 Israelis.


>> Why?


Listen,
 my
 my
 team
 gave
 me
 a
 script
 that


they
 asked
 me
 to
 read,
 but
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 ask
 you
 um
 in
 the
 nicest
 way
 I


possibly
 can.
 Thank
 you

foremost

 imagined.
 I
 had


so
 many
 dreams
 in
 my
 life,
 but
 this
 was


not
 one
 of

 the
 very
 fact
 that


these

a
 sort
 of
 burden
 of
 uh
 responsibility
 to

John
 Kuryoku,
 the
 world
 knows
 your
 name.


Why?


Why
 does
 the
 world
 know
 your
 name?


>> I
 can
 give
 you
 two
 answers.


One,
 I'm
 proud
 to
 say
 that
 I
 blew
 the


whistle
 on
 the
 CIA's
 torture
 program
 in


a
 nationally
 televised
 interview
 with


ABC
 News.
 The
 second
 reason
 is


I
 blew
 the
 whistle
 a
 long
 time
 ago
 and


just
 in
 the
 past
 18
 months,
 I
 seem
 to


have
 hit
 some
 sort
 of
 YouTube
 algorithm


sweet
 spot
 and
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 my


message
 is
 getting
 out
 there.
 And
 you


went
 to
 prison
 for
 blowing
 the
 whistle.


>> I
 did
 and
 I
 would
 do
 it
 again
 tomorrow.


I
 really
 would.
 You
 know,
 I
 was
 I
 was


giving
 an
 interview
 to
 the
 BBC
 the
 day


after
 I
 got
 out
 of
 prison.
 They
 were
 the


first
 uh
 outlet
 to
 ask
 for
 an
 interview.


And
 so
 I
 gladly
 gave
 it
 to
 them.
 And
 the


interviewer
 said


kind
 of
 perturbedly,


"You're
 not
 showing
 any
 remorse
 or


contrition."
 And
 I
 said,
 "No,
 I'm
 not


remorseful.
 I'm
 not
 contrite.
 I
 would
 do


it
 again.
 I
 would
 let
 them
 send
 me
 to


prison
 again
 because
 it
 was
 the
 right


thing
 to
 do."


>> And
 you
 were
 a
 spy
 in
 the
 CIA.


>> Yeah.
 I
 was
 quite
 an
 accomplished
 spy
 in


the
 CIA.
 I
 spent
 15
 years
 in
 the
 CIA.


The
 first
 half
 of
 my
 career
 was
 in


analysis
 and
 uh
 and
 I
 got
 bored,


frankly.
 And
 so
 I
 made
 an
 unusual
 at
 the


time
 change
 to
 counterterrorism


operations.
 And
 then
 I
 was
 the
 chief
 of


CIA
 counterterrorism
 operations
 in


Pakistan
 after
 the
 9/11
 attacks.


>> And
 if
 I'd
 never
 heard
 about
 the
 CIA


before
 and
 I
 had
 never
 heard
 about
 your


role
 in
 the
 CIA
 before
 and
 I
 was
 a


16-year-old,


>> right?


>> How
 would
 you
 explain
 to
 me
 what
 you
 did


there?
 What
 your
 role
 was
 and
 what
 the


CIA
 is?


>> Sure.
 The
 CIA
 is
 an
 intelligence
 service


whose
 job
 it
 is
 at
 its
 most
 basic
 level


to
 recruit
 spies
 to
 steal
 secrets
 and
 to


analyze
 those
 secrets
 so
 that
 the


policymakers
 can
 make
 the
 best
 informed


policy.
 After
 9/11,
 we
 were
 expecting
 an


attack,
 to
 use
 Osama
 bin
 Laden's
 words,


that
 would
 dwarf
 911.


And
 so
 my
 job
 was
 to
 infiltrate
 al-Qaeda


by
 recruiting
 members
 of
 al-Qaeda


to
 tell
 us
 when
 and
 where
 that
 next


attack
 was
 going
 to
 come
 so
 that
 we


could
 disrupt
 it.
 We
 could


kill
 or
 capture
 the
 leadership
 and


destroy
 the
 organization.


>> And
 give
 me
 a
 range
 of
 the
 things
 that


you
 did
 during
 your
 time
 in
 the
 CIA
 just


for
 a
 very
 topline
 range
 of
 the
 types
 of


things
 you
 worked
 on.
 Oh,
 sure.
 Um,
 as


an
 analyst,
 it
 was
 actually
 quite


straightforward.
 Uh,
 we
 would
 write
 for


the
 president,
 the
 vice
 president,
 the


secretaries
 of
 state
 and
 defense,
 and


the
 national
 security
 adviser.


>> And
 who
 were
 the
 presidents
 during
 this


that
 time?


>> Uh,
 when
 I
 started,
 it
 was
 George
 HW


Bush,
 the
 father,
 and
 then
 it
 was
 Bill


Clinton,
 then
 George
 W.
 Bush.
 There
 are


several
 different
 publications.
 There's


the
 president's
 daily
 brief,
 which
 is


the
 most
 important.
 I
 covered
 Iraq
 the


entire
 time
 that
 I
 was
 in
 analysis
 from


well
 before
 most
 Americans
 had
 ever


heard
 of
 Iraq.
 I
 was
 told
 actually
 that


it
 was
 a
 training
 account
 because


nothing
 ever
 happened
 there.
 Nothing


ever
 changed.
 And
 then


Iraq
 invaded
 Kuwait.
 The
 next
 day
 I
 got


to
 the
 office
 early.
 I
 was
 25


years
 old,
 26
 years
 old.
 And
 uh
 my
 boss


said,
 "Don't
 take
 your
 jacket
 off.
 We're


going
 to
 the
 White
 House."
 I
 had
 never


been
 to
 the
 White
 House
 before
 except
 as


a
 tourist.
 And
 so
 we
 got
 in
 a
 car,
 went


to
 the
 White
 House.
 We're
 ushered
 into


the
 Oval
 Office.
 It's
 the
 president,
 the


vice
 president,
 the
 national
 security


adviser,
 the
 director
 of
 the
 CIA,
 my


boss,
 and
 me.
 And
 then
 we
 all
 sit
 down.


The
 president
 tells
 us,
 "Sit
 down."
 We


sit
 down
 and
 the
 president
 says,"Well,


now
 what
 do
 we
 do?"
 And
 everybody
 turns


and
 looks
 at
 me
 and
 it
 took
 me
 a
 second


and
 I
 said,
 "Uh,
 yes."
 I
 said, "Mr.


President,
 as
 you
 know,
 Iraqi
 troops


crossed
 the
 border
 at
 2:00
 this
 morning.


They
 the
 royal
 family
 has
 uh
 has
 run


away
 to
 uh
 Saudi
 Arabia.
 They've
 named
 a


new
 occupation
 governor,
 etc.,
 etc.
 Do


we
 know
 who
 that
 is?"
 I
 said,
 "Yes,


sir."
 I
 gave
 him
 the
 name
 and
 I
 said,


"Actually,
 he
 uh
 he's
 the
 co-founder
 of


the
 Popular
 Front
 for
 the
 Liberation
 of


Palestine."
 The
 vice
 president
 shouts,


"Jesus
 Christ."
 And
 then
 the
 president


says,
 "Gentlemen,
 thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.


We'll
 take
 it
 from
 here."
 And
 I
 remember


saying
 to
 myself,
 "My
 friends
 would


never
 believe
 in
 a
 thousand
 years
 what
 I


was
 doing
 right
 now.
 They
 wouldn't
 even


believe
 me
 if
 I
 told
 them."
 That's
 what


an
 analyst
 does.
 When
 I
 switched
 to


operations
 again,
 the
 the
 job
 was
 very


straightforward.
 It
 was
 to
 recruit
 spies


to
 steal
 secrets.
 But
 then
 if
 you're


involved
 in
 counterterrorism
 operations,


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 extras
 that
 you
 have


to
 be
 trained
 in.
 So
 you
 go
 through
 the


normal
 spy
 training.
 This
 is
 how
 you


ingratiate
 yourself.
 It's
 something


called
 the
 asset
 acquisition
 cycle.


Spot,
 assess,
 develop,
 recruit.
 I
 meet


you
 at
 a
 cocktail
 party.
 You
 seem
 like
 a


nice
 guy.
 I
 introduce
 myself.


I
 ask,
 "Uh,
 so
 what
 do
 you
 do
 for
 a


living?"
 Well,
 if
 you
 tell
 me
 you
 manage


a
 shoe
 store,
 I'm
 going
 to
 say,
 "Well,


it
 was
 very
 nice
 meeting
 you."
 And
 I'm


going
 to
 go
 on
 to
 the
 next
 guy.
 But
 if


you
 tell
 me
 you
 work
 at
 the
 port,
 you


work
 in
 the
 Ministry
 of
 Defense,
 you


work
 in
 the
 Chinese
 embassy,


I'm
 going
 to
 invite
 you
 to
 lunch.
 I've


spotted
 you.
 I've
 assessed
 you.
 And
 my


assessment
 is
 I'd
 like
 to
 get
 to
 know


you.
 Then
 I
 begin
 to
 develop
 you.
 I'll


give
 you
 an
 example.
 I
 was
 in
 Pakistan.


I
 got
 a
 tip
 that
 uh
 that
 al-Qaeda,
 a


group
 of
 mid-level
 al-Qaeda
 fighters
 was


meeting
 every
 single
 day
 in
 a
 coffee


shop
 at
 10:00
 in
 the
 morning.
 My
 Arabic


was
 absolutely
 flawless
 at
 the
 time.
 And


so
 I
 had
 a
 bushy
 beard
 that
 I
 grew
 for


operational
 reasons.


>> Can
 I
 hear
 some
 of
 your
 Arabic?


>> Yeah.
 Uh,


it's
 nice
 to
 meet
 you.
 Or


Alhamdulillah.


Uh,
 so
 I
 uh
 I
 bought
 an
 Arabic
 newspaper


and
 I
 went
 to
 the
 coffee
 shop
 and
 I
 just


sat
 there
 and
 sure
 enough
 at
 10:00
 the


four
 of
 them
 came
 in.
 One
 of
 them
 looked


at
 me
 and
 I
 looked
 at
 him
 and
 that
 was


it.
 We
 made
 eye
 contact.
 I
 did
 that
 for


a
 week.


The
 second
 week
 I
 was
 there
 drinking
 my


coffee,
 sitting
 with
 my
 Arabic


newspaper,
 and
 the
 one
 who
 had
 looked
 at


me
 the
 week
 before,
 he
 nodded.
 So
 I


nodded
 back.
 That
 was
 it.
 No


communication
 otherwise.
 The
 third
 week,


I'm
 a
 regular
 now.
 He
 recognizes
 me.


So
 he
 says
 to
 me,
 I
 said,
 "May
 peace
 be


upon
 you."
 And
 I
 say,
 "And
 upon
 you


peace."
 One
 day
 he
 came
 in
 alone
 and
 I


said,
 "Please
 have
 a
 seat.
 Sit
 with
 me.


No
 sense
 in
 you
 sitting
 alone
 and
 me


sitting
 alone."
 So
 he
 sat
 down.
 We


started
 talking.
 And
 um
 I
 asked
 him
 how


long
 he
 had
 been
 in
 Pakistan.
 He
 said,


"Oh,
 I've
 been
 here
 for
 5
 years.
 I
 was


in
 Afghanistan.
 I
 was
 making
 jihad


against
 the
 Americans."
 And
 I
 said,
 "Oh,


that
 must
 have
 been
 hell
 on
 earth."
 He


said,
 "Oh."
 He
 said
 that
 the
 bombing
 of


Tora
 Bora
 was
 hideous.
 That
 was
 the
 word


that
 he
 used.
 It
 was
 hideous.
 And
 I


said,
 "And
 what
 about
 your
 family?
 How's


your
 family?"
 He
 said,
 "My
 wife
 and
 and


son
 and
 daughter
 are
 in
 Cairo.
 I've


never
 met
 my
 son."
 He
 was
 born
 just


after
 I
 left
 to
 make
 jihad.
 I
 said, "I'm


so
 sorry."
 And
 he
 said,
 "Yes,
 I'm
 I'm


lonely
 and
 I
 I
 want
 to
 go
 home."
 And
 we


continued
 this
 relationship.


And
 finally,
 I
 said
 to
 him,
 "Let
 me
 take


you
 to
 dinner.
 let's
 get
 out
 of
 the


coffee
 shop.
 The
 truth
 was
 I
 didn't
 want


one
 of
 his
 friends
 to
 walk
 in
 and
 see


us.
 So,
 we
 went
 to
 a
 restaurant
 for


dinner
 and
 I
 said,
 "Listen,


there's
 something
 that
 I
 haven't
 been


truthful
 with
 you
 about.


I'm
 not
 Lebanese."


And
 I
 said,
 "Actually,
 I'm
 American.


Are
 you
 okay
 with
 that?"


And
 he
 says,
 "I
 think
 so."
 I
 said,


'Well,
 actually,


I'm
 a
 CIA
 officer.


And
 he
 says,
 '
 Okay.'
 So,
 he
 didn't
 run


screaming
 from
 the
 room
 or
 pull
 a
 gun
 or


anything.
 And
 he
 said,


"Why
 do
 you
 want
 me?
 Why
 do
 you
 want
 to


talk
 to
 me?"
 I
 said,
 "Actually,
 you
 have


access
 to
 something
 that
 I
 want."
 It
 was


very
 specific.
 And
 I
 told
 him
 what
 it


was.
 And
 he
 says,
 "And
 what
 will
 you
 do


for
 me?"
 And
 I
 said,
 "Anything
 your


heart
 desires."


And
 he
 said,
 "I
 want
 to
 go
 home."


I
 said, "I
 can
 do
 that."
 And


>> you
 wanted
 information
 presumably.


>> I
 wanted
 information,
 very
 specific


information,


>> which
 you
 can't
 share.


>> No.
 I'll
 go
 right
 back
 to
 prison.
 So,


uh,
 so
 um,
 we
 got
 him
 a
 passport.
 I


bought
 him
 a
 first
 class
 ticket
 and
 I


took
 him
 to
 the
 airport,
 gave
 him
 some


cash
 to
 get
 himself
 started
 again.
 And
 I


said,
 "Before
 you
 go,
 I
 have
 to
 ask
 you,


why
 did
 you
 agree
 to
 give
 me
 this


information?
 I
 mean,
 presumably
 I'm
 the


enemy."
 And
 he
 said,
 "I've
 been
 here
 5


years,
 and
 you're
 the
 first
 person
 who


ever
 asked
 me
 about
 my
 family."


So
 I
 said,
 "Best
 of
 luck.
 Never
 saw
 him


again.


That's
 the
 job.


>> I
 have
 to
 ask
 you,


>> take
 me
 on
 the
 journey
 of
 you
 being
 a


young
 man


>> in
 West
 Pennsylvania,


>> right?


>> To
 becoming
 a
 spy.
 What
 happened?


Because
 I'll
 be
 I'll
 be
 honest.
 You


know,
 I
 don't
 really
 know
 what
 my


perception
 of
 spies
 is,
 but
 it's
 not


you.


>> That's
 good.


>> That's
 good.
 See,
 because
 I
 kind
 of
 work


under
 the
 radar.
 M
 so
 that's
 really


interesting
 is
 I
 there's
 there's
 so
 many


um
 once
 you
 learn
 about
 spies
 as
 a


podcast
 like
 so
 if
 you
 go
 back
 a
 couple


of
 years
 and
 someone
 had
 told
 me
 about


spies
 I
 wouldn't
 have
 believed
 them
 I


wouldn't
 have
 believed
 that
 these
 things


actually
 happened


>> you
 know
 you
 hear
 about
 people
 going


undercover


>> and
 going
 to
 other
 countries
 and
 getting


secrets
 and
 and
 all
 of
 these
 things


>> and
 it's
 not
 until
 you
 meet
 the
 people


that
 said


yes
 that's
 me
 I
 used
 to
 do
 that
 that


you're
 sort
 you
 have
 this
 paradigm
 shift


in
 your
 mind
 and
 you
 go,
 "Oh
 my
 god,


what
 else
 might
 be
 going
 on?"


>> Right?


>> Because
 I
 lived
 in
 this
 world
 probably


up
 until
 the
 age
 of,
 I
 don't know,
 30


years
 old
 where
 I
 kind
 of
 just
 assume


things
 are
 what
 they
 are


>> like
 as
 I
 see
 them.
 And
 then,
 you
 know,


you
 start
 to
 discover
 that
 there's


layers
 of
 secrecy.
 Nations
 are
 against


each
 other.
 They're
 doing
 all
 of
 these


covert
 operations.
 And
 even
 like
 as
 a


podcaster
 now,
 I
 have
 moments
 where
 I
 go


like,
 "How
 do
 I
 know
 that
 you're
 not


you're
 not
 here
 to
 steal
 secrets
 from


me?"


>> Right?
 So,
 you
 know
 what's
 funny?
 When
 I


had
 Andre
 Bustamante
 on
 the
 show,
 the


comment
 sections
 are
 always
 the
 same.


They're
 always
 like,
 "Once
 a
 CIA
 spy,


always
 a
 CIA
 spy."


>> I
 hate
 when
 people
 say
 that.
 It's
 so


intellectually
 lazy.


>> But
 I
 just
 I
 do
 wonder
 and
 I
 go,
 "Okay,


here's
 a
 super
 conspiracy
 theory.
 What


if
 the
 CIA
 have
 made
 spies
 do
 really


well
 in
 the
 YouTube
 algorithm
 so
 that


all
 of
 us
 as
 long
 form
 podcasters
 invite


them
 on
 and
 then
 they


>> You
 know what?
 I
 would
 agree
 with
 that.


I
 would
 have
 agreed
 with
 that
 a
 year
 ago


because
 Andrew
 Bamante
 has
 really
 made
 a


handsome
 living
 out
 of
 selling
 his


experience
 and
 he's
 on
 every
 podcast.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 I
 am
 the
 most
 anti-CIA
 former
 CIA


person
 that's
 out
 there.


>> But
 wouldn't
 that
 be
 the
 perfect
 CIA


agent?


>> I
 mean,
 if
 if
 I
 weren't
 constantly


criticizing
 the
 CIA
 as
 a
 as
 a
 an


organization
 that's
 just
 out
 of
 control.


Do
 you
 think
 the
 CIA
 are
 have
 a
 strategy


for
 podcasters
 and
 for
 podcasting?


>> I
 think
 yes,
 now
 they
 do.
 It
 took
 them
 a


little
 while
 to
 to
 get
 current,
 but
 just


like
 they
 over
 time
 developed
 a
 strategy


with
 Hollywood,


sure
 they're
 developing
 a
 strategy
 with


podcasters.
 You
 know,
 it
 was
 only
 in
 the


last
 10
 years
 that
 the
 CIA
 opened
 a


branch
 within
 the
 Office
 of
 Public


Affairs
 whose
 job
 it
 is
 solely
 to
 liers


with
 Hollywood
 studios.
 The
 FBI's
 been


doing
 this
 since
 the
 since
 the
 40s.
 And


the
 goal
 is
 that
 everything
 that
 comes


out
 of
 Hollywood
 should
 be
 pro-CIA.


And
 you
 know,
 we
 end
 up
 with
 with
 Zero


Dark
 30
 and
 you
 know,
 the
 recruit
 and


the
 CIA,
 Argo,
 the
 CIA
 is
 always
 the


hero
 in
 these
 movies.
 If
 you
 were
 still


at
 the
 CIA
 now
 and
 your
 job
 was
 to
 in


infiltrate
 and


uh
 use
 creators
 or
 podcasters
 as
 an


asset
 for
 the
 CIA's
 objectives,
 how


might
 you
 design
 that
 plan?
 If
 we
 were


just
 hypothesizing,


you
 would
 have
 to
 have


a
 goal


that
 would
 be
 specific
 enough
 that
 you


could
 actually
 track
 the
 progress
 to
 it.


So,
 you
 can't
 just
 say,
 "Well,
 I'm
 going


to
 pay
 this
 podcaster
 x
 amount
 of
 money,


and
 we're
 going
 to
 we're
 going
 to
 we're


going
 to
 do
 something
 with
 the
 algorithm


to
 make
 him
 vastly
 popular
 among


men,
 you
 know,
 18
 to
 30,
 let's
 say.


There's
 got
 to
 be
 more
 to
 it
 than
 that.


It
 has
 to
 be
 a
 message.
 You've
 got
 to
 be


able
 to
 get
 a
 specific,
 well-honed


message
 out
 there.
 And
 the
 message
 can


be
 anything.


It
 could
 be,
 you
 know,
 love
 the
 CIA,


we're
 the
 good
 guys.
 It
 could
 be
 support


the
 overthrow
 of
 the
 Iranian
 government.


It
 could
 be,
 you
 know,
 any
 criticism
 of


Benjamin
 Netanyahu
 is
 anti-semitism.


It
 could
 be
 anything
 you
 want
 it
 to
 be.


You
 just
 have
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 it's


repeated
 enough.
 See,
 this
 was
 the


danger
 with
 the
 torture
 program.
 This
 is


one
 of
 the
 very
 important
 reasons
 that
 I


went
 public
 when
 I
 did
 because
 my


colleagues,
 my
 superiors
 at
 the
 CIA
 kept


repeating
 this
 lie
 over
 and
 over
 and


over
 again
 that
 torture
 worked
 and
 that


torture
 got
 us
 information
 that
 saved


American
 lives.
 And
 that
 was
 just
 simply


not
 true.
 It
 was
 a
 lie.
 Besides
 being


illegal,
 immoral,
 unethical,
 it
 just


wasn't
 true.
 And
 so
 I
 decided
 before
 we


go
 down
 this
 road
 anymore,
 I'm
 going
 to


go
 public.


>> So
 can
 you
 take
 me
 back
 then?
 We
 got
 a


little
 bit
 sidetracked
 there,
 but


>> Sure.


>> John,
 how
 did
 you
 come
 to
 be
 a
 CIA
 spy?


>> When
 I
 was
 9
 years
 old,
 I
 told
 my


parents
 that
 I
 wanted
 to
 be
 a
 spy
 when
 I


grew
 up.
 it
 came
 time
 to
 apply
 for


college
 and
 I
 only
 applied
 at
 one


university,
 George
 Washington
 University


in
 Washington
 because
 it
 was
 two
 blocks


from
 the
 White
 House
 and
 it
 was
 one
 of


only
 three
 schools
 in
 America
 that


offered
 a
 Middle
 Eastern
 studies


program.
 I
 was
 one
 of
 only
 four
 people


in
 that
 brand
 new
 Middle
 Eastern
 studies


program.
 I
 stayed
 for
 a
 master's
 degree


in
 legislative
 affairs
 with
 a
 focus
 on


foreign
 policy
 analysis.
 I
 was
 taking
 a


class
 in
 that
 program
 called
 the


psychology
 of
 leadership.
 It
 was
 taught


by
 an
 eminent
 psychiatrist
 named
 Dr.


Gerald
 Post
 and
 he
 gave
 us
 an
 assignment


one
 uh
 one
 day
 where
 we
 had
 to
 shadow


our
 bosses.
 We
 had
 to
 just
 follow
 our


bosses
 for
 a
 week.


>> Your
 bosses?


>> Yeah.
 I
 worked
 at
 a
 labor
 union
 called


the
 United
 Food
 and
 Commercial
 Workers


Union.
 And
 so
 we
 were
 just
 supposed
 to


follow
 our
 boss
 around
 for
 a
 week
 and


then
 write
 a
 psychological
 profile.
 I


used
 dozens
 of,
 you
 know,
 footnotes
 from


psychological,
 you
 know,
 psychology


texts.
 And
 I
 ended
 up
 saying
 that
 he
 was


a
 sociopath
 with
 psychopathic
 and


possibly
 violent
 tendencies.
 And,
 you


know,
 I
 had
 these
 citations.


I
 passed
 the
 paper
 in.
 Dr.
 Post
 gives
 it


back
 to
 me
 a
 week
 later,
 gave
 me
 an
 A,


and
 then
 he
 wrote,
 "Please
 see
 me
 after


class."
 So
 I
 went
 up
 to
 him
 after
 the


class
 and
 I
 said,
 "Dr.
 Post,
 you
 wanted


to
 see
 me."
 He
 says,
 "Come
 to
 my


office."
 So
 we
 went
 down
 there.
 He


closed
 the
 door
 and
 he
 says,
 "Listen,


I'm
 not
 really
 a
 professor
 here.
 I'm
 a


CIA
 officer
 undercover
 as
 a
 professor


here,
 and
 I'm
 looking
 for
 people
 who


would
 fit
 into
 the
 CIA's
 culture.
 I


think
 you
 would
 fit
 into
 the
 CIA's


culture.
 Would
 you
 like
 to
 be
 a
 spy?"


And
 I
 said,
 "Yes,


I
 would."
 He
 picked
 up
 the
 phone
 and


called
 the
 number
 and
 he
 said,
 "Bob,


this
 is
 Jerry.
 I've
 got
 a
 good
 one
 for


you.
 Do
 you
 have
 some
 time?"
 And
 he


said,
 "Sure."
 He
 writes
 an
 address
 on
 a


scrap
 of
 paper.
 And
 he
 says,
 "Be
 at
 this


address
 in
 20
 minutes."
 It
 was
 only
 one


subway
 stop
 away.
 So
 I
 jumped
 on
 the


metro.
 I
 went
 to
 Rosland,
 Virginia,
 just


across
 the
 river.
 I
 had
 to
 buzz
 to
 be


led
 in.
 And
 a
 woman
 opens
 the
 door.
 She


says,
 "Are
 you
 here
 for
 Bob?"
 And
 I


said,
 "Yes."
 She
 says,
 "Come
 on
 in."


I'm
 sitting
 there
 for
 a
 moment
 and
 then


this
 like
 6
 foot6,
 350
 lb
 giant
 barrels


out
 of
 his
 office
 and
 he
 says,
 "John


Bob,
 how
 the
 hell
 are
 you?
 I
 want
 you
 to


be
 at
 the
 George
 Washington
 University


Medical
 School
 Saturday
 morning
 at
 8:00.


We've
 got
 some
 tests
 for
 you."
 I
 said,


"Okay."
 And
 then
 we
 shook
 hands
 and
 I


left.
 So,
 Saturday
 morning,
 I
 went
 to


the
 GW
 Medical
 School
 auditorium.
 There


were
 like,
 I
 don't
 know,
 200
 people


there
 and
 they
 hand
 us
 a
 test.
 My
 wife


picked
 me
 up.
 She
 said,
 "How
 did
 you


do?"
 I
 said, "I
 have
 no
 idea."


>> Does
 your
 wife
 at
 this
 point
 know
 that


you
 were
 applying
 for
 the
 CIA?


>> Yes.
 And
 that
 was
 going
 to
 be
 pretty


much
 the
 extent
 of
 what
 she
 ended
 up


knowing
 cuz
 once
 I
 got
 in,


>> but
 you
 were
 allowed
 to
 tell
 her.


>> I
 was
 not
 allowed
 to
 tell
 her.
 No.
 So,


you
 told
 her
 anyway?


>> Yeah.
 When
 I
 first
 applied,
 they
 said,


"Listen,
 don't
 tell
 anybody
 because
 you


may
 go
 undercover.
 You
 may
 go
 under
 deep


cover,
 and
 we
 can't
 have
 people
 out


there
 who
 know
 that
 you're
 a
 CIA


officer."


>> Presumably,
 the
 CIA
 are
 smart
 enough
 to


be
 able
 to
 check
 if
 you've
 told
 her.


>> Yeah.
 And
 they
 ask
 you
 on
 the
 polygraph,


"Did
 you
 tell
 her?"
 Really?


>> And
 I
 said, "Yeah,
 I
 told
 her.
 She's
 my


wife.
 What
 am
 I
 going
 to
 do?"
 You
 know,


but
 it
 got
 to
 the
 point
 where
 I'd
 get


home
 from
 a
 day
 where,
 you
 know,
 I
 broke


into
 some
 guy's
 house
 and
 and
 planted
 a


camera
 on
 a
 bug
 and
 I'd
 get
 home
 and


she'd
 say,
 "How
 was
 your
 day?"
 I'd
 say,


"Great.
 What'd
 you
 do?"
 Not
 a
 darn


thing.
 And
 then
 my
 phone
 would
 ring
 at,


you
 know,
 midnight
 and
 a
 guy
 would
 say,


"The
 rain
 in
 Spain
 falls
 mainly
 in
 the


plane."
 And
 I'd
 say,
 "Uh,
 Marzy
 Oats
 and


Dozy
 Oats
 and
 Little
 Lambs
 Ivy."
 And


that
 means
 meet
 me
 at
 the
 yacht
 club


parking
 lot
 in
 three
 hours.


And
 then
 I'd
 leave.
 She's
 she
 would
 say,


"Where
 where
 are
 you
 going?
 It's


midnight.
 I
 got
 to
 work."
 So
 I'd
 leave.


I'd
 do
 my
 meeting.
 I'd
 come
 home
 6:00
 in


the
 morning
 just
 in
 time
 to
 shower
 and


shave
 and
 get
 dressed
 to
 go
 to
 work.
 And


she
 would
 say,
 "What
 was
 her
 name?"


And
 I
 I
 remember
 this
 one
 terrible
 time.


That's
 what
 she
 said
 to
 me.
 What
 was
 her


name?
 The
 truth
 is,
 I
 had
 been
 sitting


in
 a
 garbage
 dumpster
 waiting
 for
 a
 guy


to
 drive
 by
 down
 the
 alley
 and
 throw
 a


bag
 of
 documents
 in.
 And
 I
 stunk
 of


garbage
 and
 I
 said
 to
 her,
 "Do
 I


seriously
 smell
 to
 you
 like
 I've
 been


with
 a
 woman?"


Seriously.


So,
 we
 ended
 up
 getting
 a
 divorce.


>> So,
 you
 do
 the
 assessment
 presumably.


you
 get
 in
 and
 then
 you
 do
 training.


>> He
 He
 called
 me
 like
 two
 weeks
 later,


Bob
 did,
 and
 he
 said,
 "You
 blew
 the


doors
 off
 those
 tests."
 I
 said,
 "Oh,


great.
 Okay."
 So,
 a
 month
 later,
 they


summoned
 me
 to
 headquarters,


and
 uh
 I
 was
 interviewed
 by
 the
 Office


of
 Neareastern
 Operations,
 the
 Office
 of


Near
 Eastern
 Analysis,
 and
 the
 Office
 of


Leadership
 Analysis.
 I
 was
 offered
 the


analysis
 job
 on
 the
 Iraq
 desk.
 And
 what


is
 the
 sum
 total
 of
 the
 training
 you


were
 given
 in
 the
 variety
 of
 different


roles
 that
 you
 had?
 Like
 how
 do
 they


train?


>> Good
 question.
 That's
 a
 good
 question


and
 the
 answer
 is
 vastly
 different


depending
 on
 where
 you
 start
 your


career.


>> So
 because
 I
 started
 mine
 in
 analysis,


the
 immediate
 training
 was
 in
 mastering


the
 CIA's
 writing
 style.
 So
 the
 most


important
 product
 that
 the
 CIA
 writes


every
 day
 is
 the
 PDB,
 the
 president's


daily
 brief,


>> and
 it
 tells
 the
 president
 what


>> what
 you
 think
 he
 needs
 to
 know.


>> Okay?


>> So
 for
 example,
 when
 the
 Iraqis
 began


moving
 to
 the
 to
 the
 Kuwaiti
 border,


we
 had
 this
 big
 debate.
 Are
 they
 going


to
 are
 they
 going
 to
 cross
 the
 border?


Yes
 or
 no?
 So
 I
 said,
 "Listen,
 why
 don't


I
 call
 the
 American
 defense
 attaches
 in


Baghdad
 and
 I'll
 just
 ask
 him
 to
 drive


down
 there
 and
 look
 and
 tell
 us
 what
 he


sees?"
 He
 drives
 down
 there,
 drives


back,
 he
 calls
 me,
 and
 he
 says,


"Literally,
 the
 entire
 Iraqi
 military
 is


on
 its
 way
 to
 the
 Kuwaiti
 border."
 So
 we


wrote
 a
 thing
 for
 the
 president
 saying


Iraq
 is
 going
 to
 invade
 Kuwait
 and
 it's


probably
 going
 to
 happen
 in
 the
 next
 48


hours.
 And
 when
 when
 did
 the
 president


see
 that
 particular
 briefing?


>> At
 7:00
 a.m.
 the
 next
 morning.


>> Okay.
 And
 is
 there
 ever
 situations
 where


the
 president
 would
 get
 it?
 In
 the


middle
 of
 the
 night.


>> Yes.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 be
 told
 in
 the
 middle
 of the
 night


that


>> Yes.
 There
 there
 are
 these
 levels
 of


immediacy.


There's
 routine
 which
 is
 like
 who
 cares?


And
 then
 there
 is
 um
 priority
 which


means
 ah
 I'll
 get
 to
 it
 sometime
 today.


Then
 there's
 immediate
 which
 means
 you


should
 probably
 read
 it
 first.


But
 then
 there's
 flash,


which
 means,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 something


terrible
 just
 happened.
 You
 should


probably
 wake
 the
 president."
 And
 then


there's
 critic,
 which
 means
 they're


coming
 over
 the
 embassy
 walls.
 We're
 at


war.
 Wake
 up
 the
 president.
 Scramble
 the


jets.


>> 911.


>> 911.


>> That's
 a
 critic.


>> So
 going
 back
 to
 this
 question
 of
 your


training.


>> Yeah.
 What
 is
 it
 that
 the


CIA
 teach
 you
 about
 human
 nature
 and
 how


to
 use
 human
 nature
 to
 your
 advantage


that
 could
 be
 transferable
 to
 other


disciplines
 in
 life
 like
 business
 or


well
 this
 is
 going
 to
 sound
 not
 very


nice
 but
 it's
 it's
 real
 life
 it's


everyday
 life
 especially
 in
 in
 business


the
 CIA
 actively
 seeks
 to
 hire
 people


who
 have
 what
 they
 call
 sociopathic


tendencies.


Not
 sociopaths.
 Sociopaths
 have
 no


conscience.
 They'll
 just
 blow
 right


through
 a
 polygraph
 exam,
 but
 they're


impossible
 to
 corral.
 They're
 impossible


to
 to,
 you
 know,
 keep


under
 rain.
 Uh,
 and
 it's
 because
 they're


not
 able,
 their
 brains
 won't
 allow
 them


to
 feel
 regret
 or
 remorse.
 Now,
 in


business,
 most
 CEOs
 are
 sociopaths.


Most,
 not
 all,
 but
 most.
 Especially
 in


big
 companies,
 because
 they
 claw
 their


way
 to
 the
 top,
 usually
 on
 the
 backs
 of


the
 people
 around
 them.
 They
 don't
 feel


bad
 screwing
 the
 next
 guy
 to
 get
 that


next
 promotion.


The
 CIA
 wants
 people
 like
 that
 because


those
 are
 the
 people
 who
 are
 going
 to


break
 into
 a
 foreign
 embassy.
 A
 normal


person
 would
 not
 advocate
 breaking
 into


a
 foreign
 embassy.
 It's
 sovereign


territory
 of
 a
 foreign
 country.
 I
 would


I'd
 be
 glad
 to
 do
 it.


>> Why?


>> Because
 we're
 the
 good
 guys.


>> So,
 do
 you
 have
 sociopathic
 tendencies?


>> Absolutely.


>> And
 what
 are
 your
 sociopathic


tendencies?


>> My
 sociopathic
 tendency
 was
 to
 operate


in
 legal,
 moral,
 and
 ethical
 gray
 areas.


Specifically,
 that's
 what
 it
 was.
 I'm


really
 curious
 about
 what
 we
 can
 learn


about
 human
 nature
 from
 someone
 whose


job
 was
 to
 meet
 strangers
 and
 to
 get


them
 to
 basically
 sometimes
 to
 turn


against
 their
 own
 country.


>> Like
 I'm
 really
 interested
 in
 and
 I


think
 I
 think
 it's
 informative
 because


so
 many
 of
 us,
 you
 know,
 when
 we
 think


about
 what
 good
 leadership
 is
 or
 what


good
 sales
 man
 or
 womanship
 is,


>> um,
 it
 seems
 like
 there's
 transferables.


I
 guess
 for
 some
 people
 it's
 family.
 I


guess
 for
 some
 people
 it's
 something


else.
 that
 that
 that
 hook
 that
 you're


talking
 about,
 that
 thing
 that
 gets


them.


>> And
 the
 word
 that
 they
 use
 at
 the
 CIA


for
 the
 hook
 is
 a
 vulnerability.
 And


it's
 not
 really
 a
 vulnerability
 in
 every


case.
 Now,


95%


studies
 have
 been
 done
 about
 this


internally
 at
 the
 CIA.
 95%
 of
 the
 people


who
 agree
 to
 become
 spies
 for
 us
 do
 it


for
 the
 money.
 Right?
 It's
 it's
 a
 simple


cash
 transaction.
 You
 give
 me
 money,


I'll
 give
 you
 secrets.
 95%.


>> So
 you
 telling
 me
 that
 you
 think
 human


motivation
 is
 95%
 driven
 by
 money?


>> Yes.


>> Really?


>> Yes.
 The
 rest
 was
 love
 and
 family,


um,
 ideology,


revenge,
 and
 excitement.


You're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 handful
 of
 people


who
 are
 hooked
 on
 James
 Bond
 movies,
 and


they
 will
 do
 it.
 I
 mean,
 you're
 going
 to


pay
 them
 anyway,
 but
 they
 will
 do
 it


just
 for
 the
 adrenaline
 rush.


>> It's
 interesting
 because
 when
 I
 look
 at


this
 list
 of
 things
 and
 I
 compare
 it
 to


business,


it
 I
 would
 say
 it's
 slightly
 different


from
 my
 experience
 of
 hiring
 people,


specifically
 of
 hiring
 people.


>> I
 tend
 to
 think
 that,
 you
 know,
 you


could
 one
 would
 ask
 themselves
 like
 why


would
 someone
 leave
 a
 company
 right
 now


like,
 I
 don't
 know,
 Open
 AI
 and
 go
 work


at
 a
 startup.
 They're
 going
 to
 get
 paid


way
 more
 at
 OpenAI.
 You've
 got
 these


this
 equity
 and
 these
 grants,
 but
 people


are
 on
 mass
 doing
 that.
 And
 even
 when
 I


think
 about
 the
 early
 days
 of
 Google,


people
 left
 the
 big
 conglomerates
 that


would
 pay
 them
 more.
 And
 they
 went
 and


worked
 for
 Larry
 and
 Sergey
 um
 getting


paid
 way
 less,
 right?
 but
 to
 be
 involved


in
 something
 small,
 scrappy,
 exciting,


>> and
 and
 so
 I
 and
 this
 is
 what
 what
 I


think
 about
 when
 I
 sit,
 you
 know,


probably
 I've
 had
 thousands
 of
 people
 in


my
 life
 now
 across
 my
 businesses,
 and


money
 is
 a
 factor,
 but
 it
 doesn't
 tend


to
 be
 the
 biggest
 factor.
 Mhm.


>> It
 tends
 to
 be,
 in
 my
 experience,


there's
 a
 particular
 hero's
 journey
 in


their
 mind
 that
 they
 want
 to
 be
 seen


through.
 They
 want
 to
 complete.


>> Uhhuh.


>> You
 know,
 there's
 a
 particular
 way
 that


they
 see
 themselves
 and
 they
 want
 to


fulfill
 that.


>> Oh,
 I
 could
 get
 that.
 I
 I
 work
 with
 a


with
 a
 very
 very
 tiny
 startup
 right
 now


called
 Ivy
 Cyber
 and
 uh
 it
 focuses
 on


privacy
 software.
 You
 know,
 things
 like,


you
 know,
 scrambling
 your
 data
 so
 it


can't
 be
 intercepted.
 that
 that
 sort
 of


thing.
 And


I've
 participated
 in
 a
 couple
 of
 pitches


to
 uh
 to
 angel
 investors


and
 they
 all
 say
 exactly
 the
 same
 thing


that
 you
 did.


>> And
 this
 is
 why
 I
 was
 confused
 when
 I


heard
 that
 money
 was
 95%.


Because
 I
 I
 just
 think


especially
 in
 the
 work
 that
 I
 don't


know,
 especially
 in
 the
 work
 that
 you


do,
 I
 would
 assume


>> but
 look
 at
 it
 this
 way.
 I
 think
 this


would
 explain
 the
 discrepancy.


um
 you're
 comparing
 people
 who
 are


making
 a
 life


>> versus
 people
 who
 are
 betraying
 their


country.


>> True.
 And
 what's
 interesting
 as
 well
 is


in
 those
 examples
 that
 you've
 given,


money
 is
 actually
 a
 proxy
 to
 be
 able
 to


take
 care
 of
 my
 family.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 to
 be
 able
 to,
 you
 know,
 fulfill
 my


ideology
 and
 maybe
 to
 get
 excitement
 and


revenge.
 Do
 you
 know
 what
 I'm
 saying?
 So


even
 that
 guy
 that
 wanted
 the
 plane


ticket
 so
 he
 could
 fly
 home.
 Yeah.
 He


could
 he
 could
 have
 the
 money
 could
 have


got
 him
 home
 if
 you
 just
 given
 him


>> the
 reason
 why
 he
 wanted
 to
 go
 home
 was


because
 his
 family


>> his
 family
 that
 was
 it.


>> What's
 the
 extent
 of
 the
 things
 that
 the


CIA
 can
 get
 as
 a
 incentive
 for
 someone


to
 turn
 against
 their
 nation
 to
 give


secrets?


>> Quite
 literally
 anything
 you
 can


imagine.


>> Even
 if
 it's
 against
 the
 law.


>> Well,
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 like


drugs
 or
 you
 know
 child
 prostitutes
 or


no
 not
 stuff
 like
 that.
 What
 if
 someone


said,
 "I
 want
 you
 to


um


get
 me
 a
 a
 green
 card."


>> Oh,
 yeah,
 sure.


>> What
 if
 they
 said,


>> "If
 the
 information
 is
 good
 enough,
 not


a
 problem."


>> What
 if
 they
 said,
 "I
 want
 you
 to
 I've


got
 this
 tax
 bill.
 I
 want
 you
 to
 make


the
 tax
 bill
 go
 away."


>> Okay.
 Give
 me
 Give
 me
 the
 plans
 to
 that


Russian
 tank.
 We'll
 make
 it
 happen.


>> What
 if
 it
 was
 an
 American?
 Would
 they


speak
 to
 the
 IRS
 here
 and
 just
 get
 rid


of
 it?


>> Oh,
 if
 it
 was
 an
 American
 citizen,
 you


mean?
 Yeah.


>> Uh,
 no.


>> But
 why?


>> No.


We
 normally
 don't
 recruit
 American


citizens.
 By
 law,
 the
 CIA
 can't
 operate


domestically.
 Although
 they
 have
 offices


all
 over
 the
 country.
 Those
 offices
 are


generally
 to
 to
 debrief
 business


leaders,
 seauite
 officers
 who
 travel
 to


denied
 areas.
 For
 example,
 if
 if
 you


take
 a
 trip
 to
 North
 Korea,
 let's
 say,


I'm
 going
 to
 call
 you
 and
 I'm
 going
 to


say,
 "You
 don't
 know
 me,
 but
 I'm
 from


the
 CIA
 and
 I
 understand
 you
 just
 went


to
 North
 Korea
 and
 I
 was
 wondering
 if
 I


could
 come
 over
 to
 your
 office
 for
 an


hour
 and
 just
 ask
 you
 about
 your
 trip."


99.99%


are
 going
 to
 say
 yes
 because
 they're


patriots.
 So,
 I
 go
 to
 your
 office,
 I


give
 you
 my
 business
 card,
 and
 we
 just


chat
 about,
 you
 know,
 your
 impressions


of
 the
 place
 and
 that
 kind
 of
 thing.


>> Just
 to
 close
 off
 on
 this
 point,
 are


there
 any
 skills
 that
 the
 CIA
 taught
 you


or
 trained
 you
 in
 that
 you
 think
 are


transferable
 for
 business
 that
 we


haven't
 talked
 about?


>> They
 they
 trained
 us
 also
 in
 lying
 and


lie
 detection.
 That
 was
 actually
 quite


important.
 You
 know,
 you
 at
 the
 CIA,


you're
 you're
 a
 trained
 liar.
 And
 this


is
 why
 the
 divorce
 rate
 is
 so
 high.
 It's


the
 highest
 divorce
 rate
 of
 any
 uh


entity
 in
 in
 the
 US
 government.
 It's


it's
 upwards
 of
 80%.


>> Trained
 to
 lie.
 How
 do
 they
 train
 you
 to


lie?


>> Hi,
 my
 name
 is
 Dave
 Phillips.
 Um
 I
 work


for
 an
 import
 export
 company.


>> But
 do
 they
 teach
 you
 the
 art
 of
 lying?


>> Oh
 yeah.


>> And
 what
 is
 the
 art?


>> You
 know,
 it's
 it's
 hard
 to
 like
 it's


hard
 to
 pin
 down.
 You
 just
 sort
 of
 have


to
 have
 it.
 You
 have
 to
 have
 that


ability.
 But
 the
 hard
 part
 is
 you
 have


to
 keep
 the
 lies
 straight.
 I'll
 give
 you


another
 example.
 I've
 never
 told
 this


story
 before.


I
 was
 asked
 by
 headquarters.
 I
 was


overseas
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 and
 I
 was


asked
 by
 headquarters
 to
 target
 one


specific
 officer
 of
 this
 foreign


country.


>> Target?


>> Yeah.
 Hi,
 how
 are
 you?
 Oh,
 we've
 never


met.
 I'm
 John.
 So
 nice
 to
 meet
 you.


>> Let
 me
 take
 you
 to
 lunch.


he
 had
 access
 to
 to
 information
 that
 we


really
 needed.
 Uh
 so
 they
 told
 me
 to


accidentally
 bump
 into
 him.
 So
 I


surveiled
 him
 for
 a
 week
 and
 he
 was


single
 and
 on
 Saturday
 morning
 he
 went


to
 a
 coffee
 shop.
 So
 I
 go
 into
 the


coffee
 shop
 and
 I'm
 looking
 at
 him
 and


he's
 looking
 at
 me
 and
 I
 said,
 "I
 know


you,
 Ministry
 of
 Foreign
 Affairs."
 He


said,
 "Yes.
 Do
 I
 know
 you?"
 I
 said,
 "I


am
 John
 from
 the
 American
 Embassy."
 "Oh,


nice
 to
 nice
 to
 see
 you."
 I
 said,
 'Hey,


good
 to
 see
 you,
 too.
 You
 live
 in
 the


area?
 Yes,
 I
 do.
 I
 said,
 'Oh,
 so
 do
 I.
 I


didn't.
 I
 lived
 like
 across
 town.
 Oh,


fancy
 meeting
 you
 here
 at
 this
 coffee


shop.
 I
 come
 here
 all
 the
 time.
 Do
 you?


Yeah,
 he
 says.
 I
 come
 here
 all
 the
 time.


Why
 don't
 you
 have
 a
 seat?
 He
 says.
 So,


I
 sit
 down.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the


conversation,
 I
 go
 back
 to
 the
 embassy


and
 I
 read
 a
 cable
 and
 I
 said,
 he's
 gay.


I'm
 100%
 sure
 he's
 gay.
 So,
 then
 we


started
 this
 conversation,
 headquarters


and
 I,
 how
 can
 we
 use
 that
 to
 our


benefit?


>> Did
 he
 have
 a
 wife?


>> No.
 He
 was
 single,


>> which
 was
 unusual
 at
 his
 age.


>> How
 did
 you
 know
 he
 was
 gay?


>> Oh,
 I
 I
 just
 It
 was
 a
 vibe.


>> Okay.


>> So,


headquarters
 says,


"We
 want
 you
 to
 pretend
 that
 you're


gay."
 I
 said,
 "Oh,
 come
 on,
 you
 guys.


No,
 we
 really
 need
 the
 information.
 You


got
 to
 pretend
 that
 you're
 gay."
 I
 said,


"Okay,
 I'll
 do
 it.
 I'll
 do
 it
 for
 Uncle


Sam."


So,
 I
 call
 him
 and
 I
 said,
 "Hey,
 I
 have


two
 tickets
 to
 this
 show
 and
 I
 was


hoping
 maybe
 you'd
 be
 free.
 Maybe
 we'll


grab
 some
 sushi
 afterwards."


He
 said,
 "Yeah,
 I'd
 love
 to."
 So,
 we
 go


to
 the
 show.
 He
 thoroughly
 enjoyed
 it.


And
 we
 go
 for
 sushi
 afterwards.


And
 then
 we
 go
 out
 again
 and
 he
 says,


"Why
 don't
 you
 come
 over
 to
 my
 place


some
 night
 and
 I'll
 I'll
 make
 dinner."
 I


said, "Great."
 So,
 I
 go
 over
 to
 his


place.
 made
 a
 lovely
 dinner
 and
 then
 I


thought,
 well,
 I
 have
 to
 invite
 him
 to


my
 place.
 So,
 I
 told
 my
 wife,
 you're


going
 to
 have
 to
 like
 get
 out.
 So,
 she


left.
 I
 made
 dinner.
 I
 removed
 all
 the


pictures
 of
 us
 together.
 And
 we
 had
 just


gotten
 married.
 So,
 we
 had
 like
 our


wedding
 picture
 up
 and
 everything.


At
 the
 dinner,


he
 leaned
 in
 to
 kiss
 me
 and
 I


instinctively
 backed
 off
 and
 he
 said,


"Oh
 my
 god,
 I'm
 sorry.
 I
 thought
 you're


gay."
 And
 I
 said,
 "Oh,
 no.
 I
 I
 am
 gay.


I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 into
 hairy
 guys.


And
 he's
 like,
 "Oh,


okay."
 I
 said,
 "I'm
 sorry.
 I
 think


you're
 great,
 but
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 feeling


it."


>> You
 didn't
 kiss
 him?


>> No.


So,
 we
 remained
 friends
 and
 in
 the
 end,


he
 gave
 me
 the
 information
 because
 we


were
 friends.
 And
 then
 he
 he
 opened
 up.


He's
 like, "I
 can't
 tell
 anybody
 I'm


gay.
 They
 suspect
 I
 am."
 and
 they
 passed


me
 over
 for
 promotion.
 And
 my
 boss
 asked


me,
 "Is
 there
 something
 in
 your
 personal


life
 that
 you're
 not
 telling
 me?
 He


knows
 I'm
 gay."
 I
 said,
 "Listen,
 your


culture
 is
 backwards.
 Don't
 tell
 them


you're
 gay.
 Just
 say
 that
 you've
 just


never
 met
 the
 right
 woman."
 And


inshallah,
 the
 right
 woman
 is
 coming,


you
 know,
 in
 your
 life
 at
 some
 point.


And
 I
 actually
 Googled
 him
 a
 couple
 of


years
 ago,
 and
 he
 did
 become
 an


ambassador
 finally.


>> And
 he's
 still
 working
 in
 that
 country


now.


>> Mhm.
 Does
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff
 happen
 a


lot
 in
 the
 CIA
 where
 you
 have
 to
 take


one
 for
 the
 team?


>> Yes.


>> Have
 you
 ever
 taken
 one
 for
 the
 team?


>> No.
 You


>> I'm
 not
 sure
 you're
 telling
 the
 truth.


>> Well,
 I
 it
 came
 close.


>> When
 did
 it
 come
 close?


>> So,
 I
 was
 overseas.
 I
 was
 a
 brand
 new


operations
 officer


and
 there
 was
 a
 woman
 in
 this
 foreign


intelligence
 service
 who
 was
 the
 ugliest


woman
 I've
 ever
 seen
 in
 my
 life.


like
 you
 want
 to
 avert
 your
 eyes
 like


she
 came
 off
 the
 side
 of
 Notradam.


She
 was
 a,
 you
 know,
 a
 stone
 gargoyle


with
 a
 giant
 mole
 right
 here
 with
 a


giant
 hair
 coming
 out
 of
 it.
 That
 kind


of
 ugly.


So,


so
 I
 took
 her
 to
 lunch
 and
 she
 was
 very


nice.
 And
 then
 I
 thought
 I
 did
 something


kind
 of
 gutsy
 by
 C CIA
 standards
 because


it
 was
 early
 on
 in
 our
 relationship.
 I


invited
 her
 to
 go
 to
 lunch
 on
 a


Saturday.
 Now,
 as
 a
 rule,
 the
 people
 in


this
 country
 were
 not
 allowed
 to


socialize
 with
 us
 privately.
 It
 had
 to


be
 like
 their
 whole
 office,
 you
 know,
 or


several
 of
 them
 together.
 So,
 I
 asked


her
 just
 to
 meet
 me
 privately
 for
 lunch


on
 Saturday.
 Don't
 tell
 anybody.


>> So,
 she
 was
 someone
 from
 the
 Middle


East.


>> Yes.
 And
 she
 agreed.
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh


my
 god,
 she
 said
 yes."
 And
 I
 ran
 back
 to


the
 office.
 I
 was
 like,
 she
 said
 yes
 to


a
 lunch
 on
 Saturday
 alone.
 And
 my
 boss


says,
 "Okay,
 here's
 what
 I
 want
 you
 to


do.
 I
 want
 you
 to
 [ __ ]
 her."
 And
 I
 said,


"What?"
 I
 said,
 "Have
 you
 ever
 seen


her?"
 And
 he
 said,
 "I
 know,
 but
 we're


the
 good
 guys
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 have


to
 take
 one
 for
 the
 team."
 And
 I
 go,
 "Oh


my
 god."
 I
 said,
 I
 go,


"Okay,
 I'll
 do
 it."
 And
 he
 says,
 "No,


you're
 not
 going
 to
 [ __ ]
 We
 don't
 do


that."
 I
 said,
 "I
 don't
 know.
 Oh,
 I
 just


started
 this.
 I've
 never
 been
 an


operations
 guy
 before.
 How
 am
 I
 supposed


to
 know?
 He
 said,
 "Come
 on."
 He
 said,


"Just
 develop
 her
 like
 a
 normal
 person.


You
 don't
 have
 to
 [ __ ]
 her."
 I
 said, "Oh


my
 god,
 you
 almost
 gave
 me
 a
 heart


attack."


>> But
 they
 they
 might
 not
 be
 mad
 if
 you


did.


>> So
 long
 as
 I
 reported
 it
 and
 I
 got
 the


recruitment
 out
 of
 him.


>> It
 wasn't
 illegal
 to
 act,
 you
 know,


sleep
 with
 assets.


>> Yeah,
 you're
 not
 supposed
 to
 sleep
 with


assets.
 It
 has
 happened
 to
 a
 couple


people
 I
 know
 and
 um
 they
 end
 up
 being


pulled
 back
 to
 the
 United
 States.
 You


have
 to
 sit
 in
 the
 penalty
 box
 if
 you
 do


that.
 You're
 not
 supposed
 to
 do
 that.


But
 yeah,
 it
 happens
 sometime.


>> So
 sextortion
 isn't
 a
 real
 thing.


>> It
 can
 be.
 We
 don't.


When
 I
 first
 got
 hired,
 one
 of
 the


old-timers
 told
 me
 the
 story
 of
 about
 an


ayatollah
 that
 they
 were
 trying
 to


recruit.
 And
 they
 set
 this
 ayatollah
 up


with
 a
 prostitute.
 And
 it
 was
 he
 had
 sex


with
 this
 prostitute
 in
 a
 room
 where


they
 had
 cameras
 everywhere.
 And
 so
 they


bumped
 him
 afterwards.
 They
 bumped
 into


him
 and
 said,
 "Hey,
 we
 have
 all
 these


pictures."
 And
 they
 laid
 out
 the


pictures
 of
 him,
 you
 know,
 butt
 naked


with
 this
 prostitute.
 And
 he
 said,


"Yeah,


give
 me
 that
 one,
 an
 8
 by10.
 Give
 me
 two


5x7s
 of
 that
 one.
 How
 about
 some
 wallet


size
 for
 this?"
 He's
 like,
 "Get
 out
 of


here."
 and
 he
 said,
 "You
 know,
 after


that,
 we
 just
 stop
 doing
 that.
 It


doesn't
 work.
 When
 you
 recruit
 somebody,


you
 really
 do
 need
 the
 relationship
 to


be
 based
 on
 mutual
 trust,


>> not
 coercion
 or
 pressure.


>> Threatening
 somebody,
 it's
 it's
 not


going
 to
 result
 in
 a
 productive


relationship.
 The
 Russians
 do
 it,
 the


Israelis
 do
 it,
 but
 most
 intelligence


services
 around
 the
 world
 don't."


because
 you've
 been
 in
 this
 world,


what
 is
 it
 that
 you
 know
 about
 the


nature
 of
 the
 reality
 that
 we
 all
 live


in
 that
 the
 average
 person
 really
 has
 no


idea
 about?


>> Do
 you
 know what
 I
 mean?


>> Yeah.


>> Because,
 you
 know,
 going
 back
 to
 what
 I


said
 earlier,
 3
 years
 ago,
 before
 I


started
 doing
 all
 this
 podcast
 stuff
 and


started
 interviewing
 people
 that
 had


been
 involved
 in
 spy
 work
 and
 the
 CIA


and
 all
 this,
 I
 was
 kind
 of
 like
 naive


to
 the
 way
 that
 the
 world
 worked.
 I


thought
 I
 thought
 if
 I
 have
 a
 password


on
 my
 device,
 my
 device
 is
 secure.
 And
 I


thought
 that
 you
 know,


>> right?
 All
 these
 kind
 of
 just
 simple


things,
 but
 what
 is
 it
 that
 you
 know


about
 the
 nature
 of
 reality
 that
 most


people
 don't?


>> Well,
 I
 I
 guess
 it's
 a
 couple
 of
 things.


You
 know,
 John
 Kennedy
 called
 the
 CIA


the
 best
 and
 the
 brightest,


and
 we're
 not.
 We're
 just
 average


people,


and
 we're
 not
 as
 smart
 as
 we
 think
 we


are.
 We're
 not
 as
 worldly
 as
 we
 think
 we


are.
 We've
 pretty
 much
 missed
 every


major
 global
 development
 since
 1947.


From
 the,
 you
 know,
 the
 rise
 of
 the


Berlin
 Wall
 to
 the
 fall
 of
 the
 Berlin


Wall
 to
 the
 fall
 of
 the
 Soviet
 Union
 to


the
 Suez
 crisis
 and
 the
 Iran
 hostage


crisis
 and
 9/11
 and
 everything
 else.
 We


missed
 it.


We're
 really
 good
 at
 day-to-day,
 you


know,
 updates
 for
 the
 president.
 We're


really
 good
 at
 recruiting
 minor
 hangers


on
 around
 terrorist
 groups,
 but
 the
 the


big
 picture
 items
 were
 just
 not
 good
 at


it.
 Number
 one.
 Number
 two,


until
 9/11,
 it
 was
 against
 the
 law,
 like


in
 stone,
 to
 spy
 on
 Americans.


And
 now
 billions
 of
 dollars
 are
 spent


spying
 on
 Americans.
 Whether
 it's
 NSA
 or


CIA
 or
 FBI
 or
 intelligence
 community


contractors,


nothing
 is
 secret.
 Nothing.
 And
 to
 make


matters
 worse,


let's
 say
 maybe
 you
 did
 do
 something


that
 law
 enforcement
 might
 be
 interested


in.
 They
 don't
 need
 a
 warrant
 anymore.


They
 don't
 need
 to
 go
 to
 a
 judge
 and


say,
 "Well,
 we
 have
 reason
 to
 believe,


you
 know,
 blah,
 blah,
 blah."
 All
 they


have
 to
 do
 is
 just
 buy
 your
 metadata


because
 it's
 for
 sale.
 Just
 go
 to
 the
 go


to
 the
 carrier.
 Just
 buy
 it.
 They
 don't


need
 a
 judge's
 order
 to
 do
 that.
 It's


all
 out
 there.
 We've
 made
 all
 we've
 made


ourselves
 vulnerable.
 All
 of
 our
 lives


are
 out
 there,
 whether
 it's
 on
 Facebook


or
 X
 or
 Insta
 or
 whatever.


If
 they
 really
 want
 to
 get
 you,
 they're


going
 to
 get
 you.
 Which
 reminds
 me
 of
 a


book
 written
 by
 Dr.
 Harvey
 Silverglate.


He's
 a
 professor
 of
 law
 at
 Harvard
 and


it's
 called
 Three
 Felonies
 a
 Day.
 And
 he


argues
 in
 this
 book
 that
 we
 are
 so


overcriminalized,


so
 overregulated
 in
 this
 country
 that


the
 average
 American
 on
 the
 average
 day


going
 about
 his
 or
 her
 normal
 business


commits
 three
 felonies


every
 day.


You
 may
 not
 mean
 to,
 but
 you
 do.
 Every


day.
 So
 if
 they
 decide
 they
 want
 you,


they
 don't
 like
 your
 politics,
 they
 can


get
 your
 metadata,
 they
 can
 go
 through


that
 metadata,
 find
 crimes
 that
 they
 can


charge
 you
 with
 and
 ruin
 your
 life.
 And


there's
 nothing
 you
 can
 do
 to
 protect


yourself.


>> To
 some
 extent,
 they
 did
 that
 to
 you.


>> Yeah,
 they
 did.
 They
 did
 that
 to
 me


>> because
 you
 spoke
 out
 about
 a
 torture


program


>> that
 was
 happening
 in
 the
 CIA.


>> Yeah.
 John
 Brennan
 wrote
 a
 letter
 to


Eric
 Holder
 and
 said,
 "Charge
 him
 with


espionage


and
 Holder
 wrote
 back."
 Eric
 Holder
 was


the
 attorney
 general.
 Holder
 wrote
 back


and
 said,
 "My
 people
 don't
 think
 he


committed
 espionage."
 And
 John
 Brennan


wrote
 back
 to
 Holder
 and
 said,
 "Charge


him
 anyway
 and
 make
 him
 defend
 himself."


So
 they
 arrested
 me,
 charged
 me
 with


five
 felonies,
 including
 three
 counts
 of


espionage.
 Espionage
 can
 be
 a
 death


penalty
 case.
 Charged
 me
 with
 espionage.


They
 waited
 until
 I
 went
 bankrupt
 10


months
 later
 with
 $2
 million
 in
 legal


fees
 and
 then
 they
 dropped
 the
 espionage


charges
 and
 they
 said,
 "We
 can
 read
 the


espionage
 charges
 or
 you
 can
 take
 a
 plea


to
 this
 lesser
 charge."


What
 are
 you
 going
 to
 do?


Roll
 the
 dice
 knowing
 that
 the


government
 wins
 98.2%
 of
 its
 cases


according
 to
 ProPublica


or
 do
 you
 just
 take
 the
 deal
 and
 make
 it


go
 away?
 And
 that's
 what
 I
 did.
 And
 you


got
 roughly
 two
 years
 in
 jail.


>> Yeah.
 I
 uh
 ended
 up
 doing
 23
 months.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 for
 anyone
 that
 doesn't
 know,
 this


was
 because
 at
 some
 point
 in
 your


career,
 you
 spoke
 out
 about
 torture


programs
 that
 were
 happening
 in


Guantanamo
 Bay
 and
 and
 elsewhere.


>> Yeah.
 And
 at
 secret
 prisons
 that
 the
 CIA


had
 set
 up
 around
 the
 world,
 right?


>> And
 going
 back
 up
 to
 the
 top
 of
 my


question
 here,
 I
 I'm
 really
 trying
 to


speak
 to
 Jane
 Dave
 who's
 listening
 to


this
 right
 now.
 Sure.
 They
 have
 a
 normal


life.
 Yep.


>> They're
 not
 really
 aware
 that
 spies


exist
 and
 the
 extent
 of
 the
 work
 they


do.
 They
 kind
 of
 assume
 that
 everything


they
 see
 and
 people
 they
 interact
 with


are
 normal
 and
 they
 think
 their
 devices


and
 everything
 else
 is
 secure.
 What


message
 do
 you
 have
 for
 them?
 A
 word
 of


warning
 or
 caution
 about
 the
 reality?


>> Yeah,
 that's
 a
 good
 question.
 Elliot


Spitzer,
 the
 former
 um
 governor
 of
 New


York,
 when
 he
 was
 attorney
 general
 of


New
 York,
 he
 said,


"Don't
 nod
 when
 you
 can
 motion.


Don't
 speak
 when
 you
 can
 nod,
 and
 don't


ever
 put
 anything
 in
 a
 text
 message."


At
 the
 CIA
 on
 our
 very
 first
 day,
 they


told
 us
 not
 to
 ever
 say
 or
 do
 anything


that
 we
 would
 be
 ashamed
 to
 see
 on
 the


front
 page
 of
 the
 Washington
 Post.
 I


took
 that
 seriously.
 The
 truth
 of
 the


matter
 is
 because
 of
 technology
 the
 way


it
 is
 today,
 our
 whole
 lives
 are
 out


there
 potentially
 for
 someone
 to
 see,


for
 someone
 to
 use
 against
 us.


So
 be
 careful
 what
 you
 say,
 be
 careful


what
 you
 write.
 even
 ingest
 because
 it


can
 be
 taken
 out
 of
 context
 to
 target


you.


>> And
 what
 about
 digital
 security?
 You


talked
 about
 the
 fact
 that
 it's
 possible


for
 these
 these
 forces
 and
 not
 just
 the


US,
 but
 other
 countries
 to
 be
 able
 to


hack
 and
 crack
 your
 devices
 and
 see


anything
 on
 your
 devices.
 I
 think
 we
 all


go
 around
 assuming
 that
 our
 devices
 are


secure.


>> They're
 not
 secure
 at
 all.
 At
 all.
 It's


not
 just,
 you
 know,
 NSA,
 CIA,
 FBI
 that


you
 have
 to
 worry
 about.
 It's
 the


British,
 the
 French,
 the
 Germans,
 the


Canadians,
 the
 Australians,
 the
 New


Zealanders,


the
 Russians,
 the
 Chinese,
 the
 Israelis,


the
 Iranians.


I
 mean,
 everybody
 has
 these


capabilities.
 Everybody.


So,
 you've
 got
 to
 be
 very,
 very
 careful.


>> Capabilities
 to
 do
 what?


>> To
 intercept
 communications.


>> I've
 heard
 you
 say
 that
 they
 can
 hack


car
 systems.
 They
 could
 so
 they
 could


theoretically
 hack
 into
 my
 car.


>> Yes,
 we
 know
 that
 from
 uh
 Wikileaks.


There
 was
 something
 in
 2017
 called
 the


Vault
 7
 revelations.
 there
 was
 a
 a
 CIA


software
 engineer
 who
 was
 disgruntled


and
 instead
 of
 going
 to
 the
 Russians
 or


the
 Chinese,


he
 went
 to
 Wikileaks
 and
 he
 downloaded


thousands,
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 pages
 of


documents
 classified
 above
 top
 secret


and
 they
 became
 what
 Wikileaks
 called


the
 Vault
 7
 documents.
 So
 they
 included


things
 like
 the
 CIA
 for
 example
 will


hack
 into
 let's
 say
 the
 Iranian
 Ministry


of
 Interior
 computer
 system
 but
 they'll


leave
 little
 electronic
 clues
 all


written
 in
 cerillic.


>> Cerillic
 as
 well.


>> The
 cerillic
 is
 the
 is
 the
 alphabet
 the


Russian
 alphabet.
 Okay.
 Yep.


uh
 or
 they
 can
 take
 control
 of
 your


smart
 TV
 remotely
 and
 they
 can
 make
 the


speaker
 turn
 into
 a
 a
 microphone.
 So


even
 though
 the
 TV
 is
 off,


it
 can
 still
 hear
 everything
 that's


being
 said
 in
 the
 room
 and
 broadcast


back
 to
 the
 CIA.


>> Can
 they
 do
 that
 with
 devices?
 Do
 they


>> Oh,
 they
 could
 do
 that.
 When
 I
 first
 got


hired,
 they
 were
 able
 to
 do
 that.


>> So
 they
 could
 be
 doing
 that
 right
 now


with
 my


>> Oh,
 totally.
 My
 opinion.


>> Absolutely.
 Yes,
 that's
 old
 technology.


And
 then
 the
 thing
 about
 the
 car,
 this


was
 revoly.
 They
 can
 take
 control
 again


remotely
 of
 a
 car's
 computer
 system
 in


order
 to


well,
 I
 mean,
 in
 order
 to
 to
 kill
 you,


>> crash
 the
 car.


>> Crash
 the
 car.
 Take
 it
 off
 a
 bridge.


Take
 it
 into
 a
 tree.
 Sure.


>> Do
 you
 know
 something
 I've
 noticed?
 Most


commercial
 teams
 aren't
 tested
 by
 their


targets.
 They're
 tested
 by
 the
 weight
 of


the
 admin
 that
 comes
 with
 every
 client.


All
 the
 follow-ups,
 all
 the
 meetings,


all
 the
 notes,
 the
 timelines
 that
 never


ever
 stop.
 These
 were
 a
 constant
 source


of
 friction
 in
 my
 commercial
 team
 until


I
 introduced
 our
 sponsor,
 Pipe
 Drive.

>> I've
 heard
 you
 talk
 about
 sleeper
 agents


before.


>> Yes.


>> What
 is
 the
 What
 is
 a
 sleeper
 agent?


Yeah,
 the
 Russians
 are
 very
 good
 with


sleeper
 agents.
 We
 Americans
 don't
 have


no
 no
 other
 country
 that
 we
 know
 of
 uses


sleeper
 agents.
 A
 sleeper
 agent
 is


someone
 who
 is
 taken
 virtually
 from


birth
 and
 trained
 to
 be
 of
 another


nationality.
 For
 example,
 let's
 say


you're
 born
 in
 Russia


and
 from
 the
 age
 of,
 you
 know,
 two,
 they


take
 you
 from
 your
 family
 with
 your


family's
 acquiescence
 and
 they
 take
 you


to
 an
 Americanstyle
 town
 that
 they've


built
 out
 in
 the
 hinterland
 in
 Russia.


And
 they
 teach
 you
 to
 speak
 English
 with


an
 American
 accent.
 You
 watch
 American


TV
 shows.
 You
 watch
 American
 movies.
 You


eat
 American
 food.
 You
 get
 an
 American


style
 education.


So,
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 that
 you're
 not


American.
 You
 speak
 English
 just
 like
 I


do.
 You
 know,
 all
 the
 same,
 you
 know,


social
 references
 that
 I
 make.
 You


follow
 the
 Philadelphia
 Eagles,
 you


know,
 or
 or
 the,
 you
 know,
 San
 Francisco


49ers
 or
 whatever.


and
 then
 they
 send
 you
 to
 the
 United


States
 on
 a
 on
 a
 fake
 with
 a
 fake
 ID.


What
 they'll
 do
 is
 they'll
 go
 through
 I


was
 born
 in
 1964.
 So,
 they'll
 go
 through


death
 records
 from
 1964
 and
 they'll
 look


for
 for
 deaths
 where
 the
 person
 was
 only


a
 day
 or
 two
 old


and
 they'll
 take
 that
 name
 and
 the
 birth


date
 and
 they'll
 get
 a
 social
 security


card
 with
 the
 birth
 date
 and
 then


they'll
 use
 the
 social
 security
 card
 to


get
 you
 a
 passport,
 an
 American


passport.
 So,
 you
 come
 here
 on
 your


American
 passport,
 everything's
 legit.


Now,
 your
 name
 is,
 you
 know,
 Bob
 Smith,


which
 was
 really
 that
 baby's
 name
 that


died.
 and
 you
 get
 a
 job,
 let's
 say,
 as
 a


travel
 agent,


and
 you
 may
 work
 as
 a
 travel
 agent
 for


20
 years


and
 never
 hear
 from
 them,


but
 then
 they'll
 activate
 you
 and


they'll
 say,
 "We
 want
 you
 to
 go
 take


care
 of
 this
 target
 over
 here.


>> Kill
 him."


>> Yeah.
 Or,
 "We
 want
 you
 to
 get
 a
 job
 at


the
 defense
 department
 and
 give
 us


everything
 that
 you
 that
 you
 can
 steal."


Whatever.
 There's
 a
 woman
 in
 my


neighborhood
 who
 was
 outed
 as
 a
 sleeper


about
 a
 year
 ago.
 She
 was
 an
 elementary


school
 teacher
 and
 they
 grabbed
 her
 and


they
 ended
 up
 trading
 her
 back
 to
 the


Russians
 for
 two
 Americans.
 So,
 they're


they're
 out
 there.
 I
 I
 interviewed
 a
 a


sleeper,
 a
 former
 sleeper
 on
 my
 own


podcast
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks
 ago.
 He
 was


from
 the
 East
 German
 Intelligence


Service
 and
 he
 was
 raised
 as
 an
 American


and
 sent
 to
 New
 York.


He
 got
 a
 job,
 I
 forget,
 doing
 what,
 like


restaurant
 supply
 company
 or
 something


like
 that.
 And
 he
 got
 married
 and
 he
 had


a
 daughter.
 and
 he
 told
 me,
 "As
 soon
 as


I
 looked
 at
 her
 face
 the
 day
 she
 was


born,
 I
 realized
 this
 life
 wasn't
 for
 me


anymore."


So
 they


sent
 him
 an
 activation.
 What
 they
 do
 is


they'll
 send
 you
 a
 radio
 message
 and
 he


didn't
 respond
 to
 it.
 And
 he
 told
 me
 he


was
 on
 the
 subway
 one
 day.
 He's
 just


standing
 there
 holding
 the
 strap
 and


this
 guy
 came
 up
 to
 him
 and
 the
 guy


grabs
 the
 strap
 next
 to
 him
 and
 whispers


in
 his
 ear,
 "If
 you
 don't
 report
 back,
 I


have
 to
 kill
 you."


And
 so
 he
 ran
 straight
 to
 the
 FBI
 field


office
 in
 New
 York
 and
 he
 said,
 "I'm
 an


East
 German
 sleeper
 and
 I
 want
 to
 turn


myself
 in."
 And
 he
 became
 a
 prolific


source
 for
 the
 FBI.


>> So
 he
 was


taken
 as
 a
 young
 person.


>> Yes.
 What
 was
 his
 story?


>> Yeah.
 Taken
 as
 a
 young
 person,
 sent
 to


Russia
 to
 become
 American.


>> They
 set
 him
 up
 with
 this
 phony


identity.


>> And
 then
 after
 he
 had
 gone
 through
 all


the
 training,
 he
 came
 over
 here
 young.


He
 was
 like
 20
 or
 22.
 And
 uh
 and
 did


this
 for
 25
 years.


And
 then
 he
 said
 as
 soon
 as
 his
 daughter


was
 born,
 he
 was
 like,
 "Wow,
 this
 is


what
 life
 is
 for,
 not
 being
 a
 sleeper."


Do
 you
 think
 the
 average
 person


listening
 to
 this
 conversation
 right
 now


is
 interacting
 in
 their
 life
 at
 this


exact
 moment
 in
 time
 with
 someone
 who
 is


involved
 in
 espionage,
 spying,
 the
 CIA


or
 some
 international


equivalent?
 Probably
 not


because


they're
 mostly
 focused.
 Foreign


intelligence
 officers
 are
 going
 to
 be


spread
 out
 all
 over
 America.
 If
 if
 if
 a


listener
 of
 this
 podcast
 is
 working
 in
 a


defense
 company,
 a
 defense
 contractor


anywhere
 in
 America,
 then
 my
 answer
 is


yes.
 Yes,
 you're
 probably
 encountering


espionage
 of
 some
 sort
 or
 somebody


committing
 espionage,
 whether
 it's


Russian,
 Chinese,
 or
 Israeli.
 They're


the
 three
 biggest
 ones
 that
 go
 after
 us.


um
 in
 Washington.


I
 mean,
 foreign
 spies
 there
 there
 could


be
 as
 many
 as
 10,000
 in
 Washington.
 I


remember
 my
 first
 wife
 um
 she
 was


teaching
 ballet
 at
 a
 small
 private


school
 and
 one
 of
 the
 uh
 the
 students


there,
 they
 were
 all
 like
 four,
 five,


and
 six
 years
 old.
 One
 of
 the
 students


there,
 her
 father
 was
 a
 Belgian


diplomat.
 And
 so
 we
 would
 sit
 and
 talk


and
 oh,
 aren't
 the
 kids
 talented?
 And


oh,
 this
 is
 so
 much
 fun.
 They
 look
 so


cute
 in
 their
 little
 tutus.
 And
 then
 I


went
 to
 work
 one
 day
 and
 as
 I
 was


walking
 in,
 he
 was
 walking
 in
 and
 I


said,
 "Oh,
 come
 on,
 Peter."
 And
 he's


like, "You
 know,
 I
 thought
 you
 were
 a


spy."
 And
 I
 said,
 "I
 actually
 didn't


think
 you
 were
 a
 spy."
 He
 was
 just
 going


for
 a
 liaison
 meeting.


We
 had
 a
 good
 chuckle
 about
 it.
 And
 I


said,
 "Listen,
 don't
 tell
 anybody."


Right.
 Right.
 Right.
 Right.
 Sorry.


So,
 I'm
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 many


how
 many
 spies
 do
 you
 think
 there
 are
 in


the
 United
 States?
 If
 you
 think
 about


>> foreign
 spies,


>> foreign
 spies,
 domestic
 spies,
 people


that
 are
 basically
 undercover,


>> including
 Americans,
 you
 mean?


>> Including
 Americans.


>> The
 number
 of
 CIA
 employees
 is


classified.
 The
 number
 of
 CIA
 employees


undercover
 is
 actually
 even
 more
 highly


classified.
 I
 can
 give
 you
 a
 guesstimate


>> but
 also
 you
 know
 Russia,
 China.


>> Yeah.
 50
 to
 60,000
 altogether.


>> 50
 to
 60,000
 in
 the
 United
 States.


>> Mhm.


>> So
 by
 a
 couple
 of
 degrees
 of
 separation


if
 you
 know
 100
 people.


>> Yeah.
 You're
 probably
 going
 to
 know
 one.


>> Sure.


>> You
 said
 there's
 probably
 about
 50,000


in
 the
 United
 States.
 So,
 I've
 just
 done


some
 quick
 math
 on
 my
 notepad
 here,


which
 means
 that
 in
 order
 to
 know
 one,


you'd
 need
 to
 meet
 6,600
 people.


>> Okay.


>> Because
 the
 US
 population
 is
 roughly
 330


million
 people.


>> That's
 right.


>> And
 I
 and
 then
 I
 did
 some
 other
 maths


and
 did
 some
 research
 and
 I
 asked
 um
 the


question
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 is


how
 many
 people
 does
 the
 average
 person


meet
 a
 year?


>> And
 it's
 roughly
 about
 3
 to
 10,000


people.
 So
 theoretically,


>> so
 the
 chances
 are
 good


>> every
 year


statistically,


according
 to
 my
 napkin
 math,
 you're


meeting
 one
 of
 these
 undercover
 spies.


One
 a
 year.


>> There
 it
 is.


>> Now,
 that
 number
 I
 gave
 you
 is
 I'm


lumping
 like
 all
 CIA
 people
 and
 all


foreign
 intelligence
 officers
 in
 the


United
 States.


>> Interesting.
 But
 again,
 if
 you
 work
 for


an
 American
 defense
 company,
 Northrup,


Grumman,
 Lockheed
 Martin,
 Boeing,
 any
 of


them,
 your
 chances
 of
 encountering
 a


foreign
 intelligence
 officer
 are
 even


money.


>> Can't
 you,
 as
 a
 spy
 with
 the
 United


States,
 ask
 the
 United
 States
 to
 give


you
 loads
 of
 money?
 Like,
 can't
 you
 say,


"You
 really
 want
 me
 to
 go
 do
 that?
 Can
 I


have
 a
 million
 dollars?"


>> Because
 you're
 giving
 you're
 potentially


giving
 away
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 to
 other


>> Oh
 my
 god.
 giving
 away
 like
 unlimited


amounts
 of
 money


>> cuz
 your
 budget
 when
 you
 were
 a
 spy.
 How


much
 was
 it


>> after
 911?
 It
 was
 unlimited.


>> What
 does
 that
 mean?
 It
 means
 you
 can


basically
 give
 away
 as
 much
 money
 as
 you


need
 to.


>> If
 I
 approach
 somebody
 and
 he
 says
 I
 can


give
 you


this
 terrorist.
 I
 want
 10
 million.
 I'm


like
 done.


>> What
 was
 the
 most
 you
 ever
 gave
 in?


>> 10
 million.


>> You
 gave
 someone
 10
 million
 for
 what?


>> Abu
 Zabeda.


>> Who's
 Abu
 Zabeda?
 We
 believed
 that
 Abu


Zuba
 was
 the
 number
 three
 in
 al-Qaeda.


He
 wasn't
 the
 number
 three,
 but
 he
 was
 a


very
 bad
 guy.
 I
 led
 the
 raids
 that


captured
 Abu
 Zuba
 in
 Pakistan,
 Fisalabad


Pakistan
 in
 March
 of
 2002.


And
 um


the
 State
 Department
 had
 a
 $10
 million


reward.
 We
 ended
 up
 giving
 the
 10


million
 to
 the
 Pakistani
 intelligence


service.
 It
 wasn't


>> a
 person


>> a
 person.
 It
 was
 just
 really
 great


analysis
 that
 led
 us
 to
 him.
 But
 there


were
 others
 in
 the
 so-called
 war
 on


terror


who


got
 more
 than
 10
 million
 and
 got
 it
 like


within
 24
 hours.


>> Individuals.


>> Individuals.


>> How
 much?


>> One
 got
 25
 million.


>> Just
 a
 person.


>> Uh-huh.
 And
 the
 thing
 is,
 you
 know,


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 danger
 there.
 If
 you're


a
 if
 you're
 a,
 you
 know,
 a
 shepherd
 or
 a


tea
 boy
 and
 you
 make
 $40
 a
 month
 and
 all


of
 a
 sudden
 you
 have
 $25
 million,


something's
 up.


>> And
 what
 was
 the
 25
 million
 for?


>> It
 was
 for
 a
 very
 high
 ranking


foreign
 terrorist
 who
 was
 brought
 to


justice.
 I
 I
 can't
 I
 can't
 say
 because


it
 was
 never


publicly
 disclosed.
 But
 what
 we
 would


have
 to
 do
 in
 a
 a
 situation
 like
 that
 is


we
 would
 have
 to
 tell
 the
 the
 source,


you
 can't
 live
 here
 anymore.
 Pick
 a


country
 and
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 home
 from


now
 on.
 And
 then
 we
 go
 to
 that
 country


and
 say,
 hey,
 can
 you
 do
 us
 a
 solid?


We've
 got
 this
 guy
 who,
 you
 know,
 he


really
 came
 through
 and
 he's
 not
 going


to
 be
 a
 burden
 on
 your
 economy


>> cuz
 he's
 got
 $25
 million.


>> Which
 country
 did
 he
 pick?


>> Oh,
 I
 can't
 I
 can't
 tell
 you
 that.


>> He
 wanted
 He
 wanted
 to
 stay
 in
 the


region.
 He
 He
 wasn't
 willing
 to
 move
 to


the
 United
 States,
 for
 example,


>> cuz
 we're
 happy
 to
 take
 him.
 You're


welcome
 to
 come
 to
 the
 United
 States.


He's
 like,
 absolutely
 not.


>> You
 went
 to
 Dubai.


>> I
 would.


>> Yeah.
 With
 the
 tax
 code.


Interesting.


H


I
 think
 I'm
 I
 think
 I'm
 Yeah,
 you
 can


tell
 my
 bias
 from
 the
 questions
 that
 I


ask
 about
 the
 things
 that
 fascinate
 me


about
 espionage
 and
 spies
 is
 just
 it's


the
 un
 their
 understanding
 of
 human


nature
 and
 what
 motivates
 us
 and
 the


psychology
 of
 humans
 that
 you
 can
 learn


from
 um
 spies
 and
 the
 nature
 of
 human


beings
 I
 guess.


>> Right.
 And
 also,
 I
 guess
 the
 other
 thing


that
 really
 fascinates
 me
 is
 just


I've
 had
 so
 many
 mind
 mind-blowing


moments
 where
 I've
 learned
 just
 how


fragile
 the
 reality
 that
 I
 believe
 is.


Like
 I
 thought
 things
 were
 secure
 and
 I


thought
 they
 were
 as
 they
 are,
 but


>> right,


>> it
 just
 doesn't
 appear
 to
 be
 that
 way.


There
 appears
 to
 be
 lots
 of
 secrets.


>> And
 you
 know,
 conspiracy
 theorists
 get
 a


hard
 time,
 but
 actually
 the
 more
 I've


done
 this
 as
 a
 job,
 the
 more
 I
 go,
 hm,


conspiracy
 theorists
 are
 right
 more
 than


I
 expected.
 See,
 and
 that's
 an
 important


point.


I


I
 hate
 conspiracy
 theories
 that
 run
 a


muck,
 but
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 the
 a
 former


CIA
 director
 is
 the
 one
 who
 came
 up
 with


the
 term
 conspiracy
 theory.


>> And
 it
 was
 it
 was
 a
 way
 for
 the
 CIA
 to


discredit
 people
 by
 making
 them
 sound


like
 crazy
 people
 when
 in
 fact
 there
 was


such
 a
 thing
 called
 MK
 Ultra.
 There
 was


such
 a
 thing
 called,
 you
 know,
 operation


grasshopper
 or
 or
 MK
 Chickwit
 or,
 you


know,
 the
 CIA
 did
 crazy
 crazy
 stuff
 from


roughly
 1952
 to
 1975.


For
 example,
 they
 um
 experimented
 with
 a


a
 virus


that
 they


that
 they
 released
 in
 San
 Francisco.


They
 waited
 for
 an
 unusually
 foggy,
 like


heavily
 foggy
 day.
 They
 released
 it
 into


the
 atmosphere
 just
 to
 see
 if
 it
 would


make
 people
 sick.
 And
 11
 people
 went
 to


the
 emergency
 room
 with
 this
 rare
 upper


respiratory
 infection.
 And
 then
 they


were
 like,
 you
 know,
 high
 fives.
 Yeah,


it
 works.
 And
 then
 they
 they
 started


experimenting
 with
 LSD.
 LSD
 was
 a
 big


thing
 at
 the
 CIA
 in
 the
 early
 days.
 We


were
 convinced.
 See,
 and
 this
 this
 is


this
 is
 where
 counter
 intelligence
 is


important.


The
 Chinese


told
 us
 in
 like
 1951


that
 the
 Russians
 were
 using
 LSD
 to
 try


to
 engineer
 it
 to
 be
 used
 as
 a
 mind


control
 drug.


That
 wasn't
 true.
 That
 was


disinformation.
 The
 truth
 was
 the


Russians
 had
 no
 LSD
 program.
 The
 Chinese


did.


So
 they
 tried
 to
 throw
 us
 off
 the
 off


the
 scent
 by
 blaming
 the
 Russians.


We
 panicked
 and
 by
 1952
 we
 started
 this


program
 called
 MK
 Ultra
 which
 began
 by


using
 LSD


um
 experimentally.


What
 the
 CIA
 did
 was
 they
 they
 started


by
 dosing
 their
 own
 employees
 without


telling
 them.


Um,
 several
 committed
 suicide.
 One


jumped
 out
 of
 a
 hotel
 window


>> with
 the
 hope
 that


>> yeah,
 we'll
 just
 see
 what
 happens.
 See


what
 they
 say.
 See
 how
 it
 feels,
 you


know,
 see
 if
 we
 can
 control
 them.
 See
 if


we
 can
 plant
 memories
 that
 didn't


actually
 happen.
 And
 then
 they
 decided,


no,
 it's
 not
 a
 good
 idea
 to
 dose
 our
 own


people.
 Let's
 just
 dose
 strangers
 out
 in


public.
 So
 they
 went
 to
 San
 Francisco.


They


rented
 a
 safe
 house
 and
 they
 hired


prostitutes
 to
 go
 out
 on
 the
 street,


pick
 up
 John's,
 bring
 them
 back
 to
 the


safe
 house.


>> John's


>> John's
 people
 who
 hire
 prostitutes,
 men


who
 hire
 prostitutes,


dose
 the
 John's
 with
 uh
 LSD
 and
 just
 see


what
 happens.


But
 I
 mean
 these
 are
 like
 serious


crimes
 you're
 committing
 against
 people.


>> Just
 reading
 about
 it
 here.
 It
 says


under
 Operation
 Midnight
 Climax.


>> Interesting
 name.
 Operation
 Midnight


Climax.
 The
 CIA
 paid
 sex
 workers
 to
 lure


men
 to
 safe
 houses
 where
 agents
 drugged


them
 and
 then
 watched
 them
 through


oneway
 mirrors
 and
 recorded
 their


behavior.


>> Exactly.


>> They
 tried
 to
 erase
 their
 personality.


Nice,
 huh?


>> The
 goal
 was
 often
 to
 break
 and
 rebuild


the
 human
 mind.
 In
 1973,
 the
 CIA


director
 ordered
 mass
 destruction
 of
 the


MK
 Ultra
 files,
 what
 we
 know
 comes
 from


accidentally
 surviving
 documents,


meaning
 this
 is
 a
 sanitized
 version.


>> That
 day,
 he
 testified
 before
 the
 church


committee.
 The
 church
 committee


specifically
 told
 him,
 "Do
 not
 destroy


any
 documents."
 He
 went
 back
 that


afternoon
 to
 the
 CIA
 and
 said,
 "Destroy


everything."
 Why?


>> Because
 it
 it
 was
 damning.
 They
 were


experimenting
 on
 American
 citizens.
 They


were
 they
 were
 experimenting
 by


spreading
 diseases
 in
 American
 cities.


And
 so


he
 was
 held
 in
 contempt
 of
 Congress.
 He


was
 fined
 like
 $150


and
 um
 about
 15%
 of
 the
 documents
 were


overlooked
 and
 survived.


We'll
 never
 know
 exactly
 what
 happened


under
 MK
 Ultra.


As
 we
 sit
 here
 now,
 there's
 people
 on


the
 streets
 of
 Iran
 that
 are
 protesting


the
 leadership
 there.
 And
 the
 CI
 the
 CIA


are
 often
 associated
 with
 some
 of
 the


coups
 going
 back
 to
 the
 1950s.
 Yes.
 And


other
 countries
 toppling
 elected
 leaders


to
 protect
 US
 interests.


>> Yes.


>> Do
 you
 think
 the
 CIA
 are
 involved
 in


Iran
 at
 the
 moment?


>> Probably.
 I
 think
 the
 Israelis
 are


heavily
 involved
 in
 Iran
 at
 the
 moment.


I'll
 tell
 you
 why.
 for
 a
 couple
 of


reasons,
 more
 than
 a
 couple.
 Number
 one,


in
 the
 so-called
 12-day
 war
 that
 we
 saw


last
 year,
 the
 Israelis
 were
 absolutely


masterful
 in
 the
 way
 they
 went
 after
 the


Iranian
 leadership.
 What
 they
 did
 was


they


focused
 on
 recruiting
 Afghan
 refugees.


Iran
 was
 home
 to
 more
 than
 2
 million


Afghan
 refugees.
 And
 as
 essentially


illegal
 aliens,
 they
 could
 not
 avail


themselves
 of
 medical
 care,


the
 welfare
 system.
 They're
 starving,


right?
 They
 only
 eat
 if
 they
 can
 beg
 for


enough
 to
 to
 buy
 food.
 And
 so
 the


Israelis
 went
 to
 these
 people
 very


discreetly
 and
 said,
 "Hey,
 you
 know,


we'll
 give
 you
 $200
 a
 month
 if
 you
 tell


us
 where
 the
 generals
 live.
 In
 which


apartments
 do
 the
 generals
 live?
 Where


do
 the
 nuclear
 scientists
 live?"


The
 Israelis
 killed
 the
 top
 12
 generals


across
 the
 entire
 Iranian
 military
 and


killed
 almost
 every
 Iranian
 nuclear


scientist
 because
 what
 they
 were
 able
 to


do
 was
 to
 recruit
 these
 Afghans
 to
 not


just
 tell
 them
 where
 they
 were
 living,


where
 the
 generals
 and
 the
 scientists


were
 living,
 but
 what
 their
 cell
 phone


numbers
 were.
 And
 so
 the
 Israelis
 were


able
 to
 geollocate
 the
 cell
 phones
 and


then
 that's
 where
 you
 fire
 the
 missile.


They
 killed
 all
 of
 them.
 And
 then
 after


the
 Iranians
 finally
 realized


it's
 the
 cell
 phones,
 they
 ordered
 that


no
 senior
 military
 officials
 and
 no


scientists
 could
 carry
 cell
 phones.
 But


it
 never
 dawned
 on
 them
 to
 tell
 the


bodyguards
 not
 to
 carry
 cell
 phones.
 And


so
 the
 Israelis
 started
 rocketing
 the


bodyguards
 and
 just
 killed
 everybody


else.


>> Have
 you
 ever
 killed
 anybody?


>> No,
 thank
 God.
 My
 children
 asked
 me


that.
 And
 I
 told
 them
 very
 proudly
 that


I
 have
 never
 taken
 any
 action
 that


resulted
 in
 the
 death
 of
 another
 human


being.
 There's
 one
 kind
 of
 half


exception.


And
 I
 think
 about
 this
 all
 the
 time.


In
 1993,


I
 guess
 it
 was.


I
 was
 sitting
 in
 the
 morning
 meeting.
 I


told
 you
 earlier
 that
 every
 unit
 meets


every
 day
 at
 9:00
 and
 you
 just
 talk


about
 what
 happened
 in
 the
 country
 that


you
 cover
 overnight.
 Was
 in
 the
 morning


meeting
 and
 the
 secretary
 came
 in
 and


she
 said,
 "John,
 General
 Powell
 is
 on


the
 phone
 for
 you.
 Call
 him
 Powell."
 I


said,
 "General
 Powell?
 How
 does
 he
 know


who
 I
 am?"
 and
 she
 said,
 'I
 don't
 know,


but
 he
 asked
 for
 you
 by
 name.


My
 boss
 is
 like,"Well,
 go
 answer
 the


phone."
 So,
 I
 went
 to
 my
 desk
 and
 I


said, 'Good
 morning,
 General
 Powell.


This
 is
 John
 Kiryaku.
 And
 he
 says,


"John,
 if
 the
 Iraqis
 were
 going
 to
 kill


the
 president,
 who
 would
 actually
 be
 in


charge
 of
 that
 operation?"


And
 I
 said, "Well,
 if
 you're
 talking


about
 the
 attempt
 to
 kill
 President


Bush,
 George
 HW
 Bush,


he
 had
 been
 visiting
 Kuwait."
 I
 said


Kuwait
 operations
 are
 run
 from
 the
 Iraqi


intelligence
 services
 Basra
 station
 but


Basra
 station
 is
 headed
 by


um
 Sabra
 Abduliz
 Adori
 the
 director
 of


the
 Iraqi
 intelligence
 service
 he
 says


where
 does
 he
 sit
 I
 said
 Baghdad
 where


exactly
 in
 Baghdad
 I
 said
 if
 you
 hold
 on


a
 second
 I'll
 look
 up
 the
 address
 so
 I


looked
 it
 up
 I
 gave
 him
 the
 address
 he


says
 thank
 you
 and
 he
 hangs
 up
 the
 phone


I
 go
 back
 in
 the


They
 were
 like,
 "What
 did
 he
 want?"
 I


said,
 "He
 wanted
 to
 know
 about
 Sabradori


and
 the
 attempt
 to
 kill
 President
 Bush."


Like,
 "Okay."


Eight
 hours
 later,
 we
 fired
 47
 cruise


missiles
 into
 Iraqi
 intelligence
 service


headquarters.
 But
 by
 then,
 it
 was
 the


middle
 of
 the
 night
 in
 Baghdad
 and
 we


killed
 the
 janitor.


So
 the
 next
 day,
 I
 said
 to
 my
 boss,
 "I


killed
 that
 janitor."
 And
 he
 said,
 "I


knew
 you
 were
 gonna
 say
 that.
 You
 didn't


kill
 the
 janitor.
 You
 had
 no
 idea
 what


Pal
 was
 going
 to
 do
 with
 him
 with
 the


information.


I
 said,
 I
 know,
 but
 I
 still
 feel
 guilty


about
 it.


Other
 than
 that,
 thank
 God
 I
 never
 had


to
 do
 it.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 how
 I
 would
 sleep


at
 night.


>> Do
 the
 US
 still
 assassinate
 people
 by


the
 CIA?


>> Absolutely.
 Yes.
 When
 Barack
 Obama
 was


president,
 John
 Brennan
 uh
 in
 the
 first


term
 was
 the
 deputy
 national
 security


adviser
 for
 counterterrorism
 and
 he


started
 something
 called
 the
 Tuesday


morning
 kill
 list
 meeting.
 So
 it
 would


be
 Brennan,
 it
 would
 be
 the
 National


Security
 Council
 attorney,
 somebody
 from


the
 CIA
 uh
 general
 counsel's
 office
 and


a
 representative
 of
 the
 director
 of
 the


counterterrorism
 center.
 And
 every


Tuesday
 morning
 they
 would
 meet
 at
 the


White
 House,
 come
 up
 with
 a
 list
 of


people
 to
 kill
 that
 week.
 The
 teams


would
 fan
 out
 around
 the
 world,
 kill


their
 targets,
 and
 then
 go
 back
 and
 meet


next
 Tuesday
 morning.


>> And
 are
 these
 world
 leaders
 or
 are
 they


normal?


>> No,
 these
 are
 these
 are
 ground
 level


terrorists.


>> Okay.
 So,
 it
 could
 be


someone
 that
 appears
 to
 be
 a
 normal


civilian,
 but
 is
 doing
 something
 that


they
 don't
 like.


>> The
 law
 is
 pretty
 clear
 on
 this.
 it
 it's


supposed
 to
 be
 somebody
 who
 poses
 a


clear
 and
 present
 danger
 to
 the
 United


States,
 to
 an
 American
 citizen,
 or
 to
 an


American
 installation,


>> which
 can
 be
 quite
 a
 vague.


>> See,
 that's
 the
 thing.
 It
 sounds
 like


it's
 clear.
 It's
 actually
 not
 at
 all


clear.
 And
 when
 they
 get
 back
 from
 these


missions,
 we
 just
 have
 to
 take
 their


word
 for
 it.


Which
 um
 spy
 force
 around
 the
 world
 did


you
 think
 was
 the
 most


impressive?


>> Oh,
 the
 Israelis.


>> Really?


>> Yeah.
 The
 Israelis
 have
 no
 rules.


They'll
 kill
 anybody.
 Uh
 what
 was
 it
 3


years
 ago?
 This
 uh
 this
 pager
 operation.


>> Oh,
 it
 was
 so
 fascinating.


>> Good
 lord.
 It
 was
 it
 was
 a
 work
 of


genius.


>> It
 is
 genius.
 It
 is.


>> It
 was
 totally
 illegal.


>> Totally
 illegal.
 But
 it
 was
 genius.
 The


the
 moving
 parts.


>> I
 I
 didn't
 believe
 it
 was
 real.
 I
 had
 to


like
 re
 I
 was
 like,
 there's
 no
 way
 that


this
 is
 real.
 This
 is
 the
 stuff
 of


movies.


>> It
 is.


>> For
 anyone
 that
 doesn't
 know,
 what
 was


the
 story?


>> Ah,
 yeah.
 Okay.
 So,
 the
 Israelis
 knew


that
 Hezbollah,
 the
 terrorist
 group


Hezbollah
 from
 Lebanon,
 was


communicating
 using
 pagers.
 They
 didn't


want
 to
 use
 cell
 phones
 cuz
 they
 didn't


want
 the
 Israelis
 to
 intercept
 their


phone
 calls.
 And
 they
 thought,
 "Oh,


pagers,
 th
 those
 are
 safe."
 So
 the


Israelis


bought
 a
 company
 in
 like
 Hungary,
 I


think
 it
 was,
 that
 made
 pagers


and
 they
 got
 Hezbollah
 to
 order
 the


pagers
 from
 this
 company.


They
 were
 able
 to
 insert
 explosives
 in


the
 pagers.
 And
 the
 pagers
 went
 to
 like


Taiwan
 and
 from
 Taiwan
 to
 Thailand
 and


then
 from
 Thailand
 to
 I
 forget
 where,


Syria,
 I
 guess.
 And
 then
 from
 Syria
 to


Lebanon.


And
 so
 what
 the
 Israelis
 did
 was
 they


were
 able
 to
 activate
 the
 explosives
 in


all
 the
 pagers
 simultaneously,


>> killing
 people.


>> They
 killed
 everybody
 of
 any
 import.


They
 essentially
 decapitated
 Hezbollah.


And
 then
 the
 ones
 they
 didn't
 kill
 in


that
 operation,


they
 bombed
 the
 apartment
 buildings


where
 they
 lived.
 See,
 this
 is
 the


thing,
 too,
 about
 the
 Israelis.
 If
 they


want
 to
 kill
 you,
 they
 won't


they
 won't
 like
 just
 do
 a
 close-in
 hit.


They'll
 blow
 up
 the
 entire
 city
 block


where
 you
 live.
 They'll
 kill
 a
 thousand


people
 just
 to
 get
 you.
 And
 they
 don't


care.
 And
 then
 then
 they
 say,
 "What
 are


you
 going
 to
 do
 about
 it?
 You
 going
 to


go
 to
 the
 International
 Court
 of


Justice?
 Do
 they
 do
 they
 really
 do
 this?


>> Yeah.


>> Uhhuh.


>> Did
 Did
 you
 ever
 interact
 with
 them?


>> Yes.


>> And
 how
 did
 you
 find
 them
 to
 be


>> miserable?


My
 very
 first
 briefing
 that
 I
 ever
 gave


as
 a
 junior
 analyst
 was
 to
 the
 Israelis.


My
 boss
 said,
 "Okay."
 He
 says,
 "You're


going
 to
 give
 your
 first
 classified


liaison
 briefing."
 So,
 it's
 going
 to
 be


the
 Israelis
 and
 there
 are
 a
 couple


things
 you
 should
 know.
 I
 said, "Okay."


He
 said,
 'We
 don't
 allow
 the
 Israelis


into
 the
 building


ever.'
 I
 said,
 'Why
 not?'
 He
 said,
 '


Because
 they
 spy
 on
 us.'
 Not
 only
 do


they
 spy
 on
 us,
 they
 would
 always
 bring


gifts
 like,
 "Oh,
 we
 brought
 this


wonderful
 gift
 for
 you
 and
 you
 every


every
 time
 somebody
 tries
 to
 bring


something
 in,
 you
 have
 to
 x-ray
 it
 and


it's
 got
 like
 listening
 devices
 and
 it's


packed
 with
 two
 years
 worth
 of


batteries."
 We're
 like,
 "You
 guys,
 you


have
 to
 stop
 doing
 this.
 Every
 time
 you


come
 here,
 you
 try
 to
 bug
 our
 conference


rooms.
 You
 got
 It's
 bad
 form.
 you
 have


to
 stop
 doing
 it.
 And
 then
 they're
 like,


"Oh,
 okay.
 Okay.
 We
 knew
 you
 would
 find


it.
 We're
 just
 kidding.
 Come
 on."
 So,
 we


have
 to
 meet
 them
 miles
 away
 from


headquarters
 in
 a
 place
 that
 we
 rent.


So,


he
 said,
 "Nothing
 over
 the
 secret
 level.


No
 top
 secret
 information.
 Just
 up
 to


secret."
 I'm
 like,
 "Okay."
 So,
 I
 go
 with


like
 a
 dozen
 analysts.
 And
 because
 I'm


the
 junior
 most
 analyst,
 I've
 only
 been


on
 the
 job
 at
 this
 point,
 I'm
 going
 to


say
 six
 weeks
 or
 so,
 I
 went
 last.
 So,


the
 first
 analyst
 says,
 "I'm
 the
 chief


analyst,
 and
 this
 is
 my
 briefing."
 And


then
 the
 next
 guy
 says,
 "I'm
 the


political
 analyst,
 and
 I'm
 the


econalist,
 and
 I'm
 the
 military
 analyst,


and
 I'm
 the
 oil
 analyst,
 and
 you
 know,


the
 tech
 analyst,
 and
 it
 comes
 to
 me."


So
 I
 said,
 because
 I
 was
 overt
 at
 the


time,
 I
 was
 not
 undercover.
 I
 said,
 "My


name
 is
 John
 Kiryaku,
 and
 I'm
 going
 to


brief
 you
 on
 Saddam
 Hussein's


psychological
 state
 of
 mind."


Well,
 there
 were
 two
 Israelis
 there.
 One


was
 from
 Mossad,
 and
 one
 was
 from


Shinbet.
 Shinbet
 is
 the
 FBI
 of
 Israel,


and
 Mossad
 is
 the
 CIA
 of
 Israel.
 So
 the


Shinbet
 guy,
 he
 has
 his
 glasses
 down


like
 this,
 and
 he
 he
 he
 goes
 like
 this.


He
 says,
 "Spell
 your
 name."


So
 I
 spell
 it
 K
 I
 R.
 I
 spell
 it.
 And
 he


goes,
 "You
 are


Jewish."
 I
 said,
 "Don't
 you
 dare.
 I
 am


not
 recruitable.
 Don't
 you
 dare
 even
 try


it."


I
 was
 furious.
 We
 went
 out
 of
 the


briefing.
 I
 was
 going
 to
 explode.


Everybody
 started
 laughing
 at
 me.


They're
 like,
 "They
 do
 that
 to
 every
 one


of
 us.
 every
 one
 of
 us.


>> They
 try
 and
 recruit
 you.


>> Yeah.


>> To
 turn
 against
 the
 United
 States.


>> Yeah.


On
 my
 very
 first
 day
 at
 the
 CIA,
 we
 got


a
 briefing
 from
 the
 CIA's
 director
 of


security
 and
 he
 said
 that
 all
 of
 us
 have


to
 have
 in
 the
 very
 front
 of
 our
 minds


the
 concept
 of
 counter
 inelligence.
 For


example,
 he
 said
 there's
 a
 steakhouse


right
 down
 the
 road
 on
 Route
 123.
 It's


the
 it's
 the
 nearest
 restaurant
 to
 the


CIA.
 He
 goes,
 "Don't
 ever
 eat
 there."


Why?
 Because
 the
 KGB
 thinks
 we
 all
 eat


there.
 So
 all
 the
 customers
 are
 KGB


officers
 waiting
 for
 CIA
 people
 to
 walk


in
 and
 start
 talking
 about
 work.
 Don't


ever
 eat
 there.
 I've
 never
 eaten
 there


to
 this
 day


>> because
 they're
 potentially
 all
 Russian


spies.
 H.
 So
 he
 said,
 "Our
 Israeli


friends
 have
 two
 officers
 in
 their


embassy,
 one
 from
 Mossad,
 one
 from


Shinbet.
 The
 FBI
 has
 identified


187
 undeclared
 Israeli
 intelligence


officers
 spread
 all
 across
 the
 United


States,
 mostly
 at
 defense
 contractors


trying
 to
 steal
 our
 secrets."
 Now,
 we


give
 the
 Israelis
 95%


of
 our
 defense
 secrets.
 You
 want
 the


F-35?
 Done.
 Here's
 the
 F-35.
 You
 want


this
 advanced
 missile?
 Here
 you
 go.
 It's


on
 us.
 So,
 they
 steal
 the
 remaining
 5%.


>> Do
 you
 think
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 was
 a
 spy?


>> I
 believe
 very
 strongly
 he
 was
 a
 spy.


Yes.


>> And
 who
 do
 you
 think
 he
 was
 working
 for?


>> The
 Israelis.
 I'm
 confident
 it
 was
 the


Israelis.
 Why


Jeffrey
 Epstein


is
 kind
 of
 the
 stereotypical
 example


that
 they
 give
 you
 in
 training
 for


what's
 called
 an
 access
 agent.
 This
 is
 a


different
 kind
 of
 recruit.
 So,
 for


example,
 if
 you're
 a
 foreign


intelligence
 service
 and
 you
 want


information
 like
 close-in
 information


from
 a
 former
 president,


from
 the
 CEO
 of
 the
 biggest
 company
 in


the
 world,
 from
 a
 member
 of
 the
 British


royal
 family,
 you're
 not
 going
 to


recruit
 these
 guys.
 You're
 not
 going
 to


recruit
 Bill
 Clinton
 or
 Bill
 Gates
 or


Prince
 Andrew.
 So,
 you
 do
 the
 next
 best


thing.
 You
 recruit
 somebody
 who
 has


regular
 access
 to
 them.
 And
 that
 person


that
 you
 recruit
 is
 going
 to
 need
 to


make
 these
 people
 feel
 comfortable
 and


appreciated.


And
 so
 you
 give
 him
 plenty
 of
 money.
 So


he
 has
 this
 house
 on
 an
 island
 or
 he
 has


the
 whole
 island.
 And
 maybe
 you
 bring
 in


young
 girls,
 you
 get
 them
 in


compromising
 positions
 just
 in
 case
 you


need
 to
 use
 what's
 called
 compromat


compromising


pictures.


We
 know
 we
 know
 now
 that
 Jeffrey


Epstein's
 house
 on
 the
 island


had
 video
 cameras,


hidden
 video
 cameras
 in
 literally
 every


room,
 including
 the
 bathrooms.


Why


Why
 would
 he
 care
 what
 was
 going
 on


unless
 it
 was
 to
 use
 that
 information


against
 people?
 As
 I
 said,
 only
 the


Israelis
 and
 the
 Russians
 use


extortion
 as
 a
 motivator.


>> So,
 would
 they
 have
 made
 Jeffrey
 Epstein


rich?


>> Yeah.


>> In
 order
 to
 give
 him
 that
 access?


>> How
 could
 they
 have
 done
 that?


>> Oh,
 that's
 easy.
 I
 mean,
 you
 you
 do
 I


mean,
 governments
 are
 the
 only
 ones


really
 that
 can
 money
 that
 can
 launder


money
 unfettered.
 And
 you
 can
 also
 do
 it


through
 real
 estate,
 through
 fine
 art,


and
 through
 horses.
 Those
 are
 the
 three


easiest
 ways
 to
 launder
 money
 today.


Fine
 art,
 real
 estate,
 and
 raceh
 horses.


>> But
 presumably,


he
 would
 have
 spoken
 out
 at
 some
 point,


no,
 he
 would
 have
 said
 something
 or


>> no,
 but
 it
 would
 explain
 why
 he
 got
 a


sweetheart
 deal
 in
 2006.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is


a
 guy
 that's
 been
 convicted
 of
 child
 sex


crimes


and
 he
 gets
 6
 months
 of
 house
 arrest


with
 an
 ankle
 bracelet.
 We
 have


mandatory
 minimums
 in
 this
 country.


That's
 a
 5-year
 mandatory
 minimum
 of


first
 offense.


>> He
 definitely
 had
 some
 interesting


power,
 didn't
 he?


>> Mhm.
 And


Alex
 Aosta,
 who
 was
 the
 prosecuting


attorney
 at
 the
 time
 and
 then
 later


became
 Secretary
 of
 Labor
 under
 Trump,


Trump
 won.
 Alex
 Aosta
 said
 that
 he
 was


ordered
 by
 the
 attorney
 general
 to
 give


Epstein
 the
 sweetheart
 deal.
 Well,
 who's


the
 only
 person
 that
 can
 order
 the


attorney
 general
 to
 do
 something?
 It's


the
 president.


So,


was
 it
 because


>> Epstein
 was
 was
 working
 on
 Clinton?
 Most


of
 the
 people
 down
 there
 were
 Democrats.


I
 mean,
 what
 what
 was
 the
 reason?
 Maybe


he
 was
 working
 for
 the
 US
 government.


>> It's
 possible
 that
 he
 could
 have
 been


doubled
 against
 the
 Israelis
 or
 others.


Sure.
 Sure,
 that's
 possible.


>> If
 you
 had
 to
 bet


>> Mhm.


>> what
 would
 you
 say
 if
 you
 had
 to
 bet


everything
 you
 have


on
 either
 him
 being
 a
 spy
 or
 not
 a
 spy?


>> Yeah.


>> What
 would
 you
 bet
 on?


>> He
 was
 a
 spy.
 I
 feel
 very
 confident
 in


that
 assessment.


I
 debated
 Alan
 Dersowitz
 about
 this
 on


the
 Pierce
 Morgan
 show
 one
 time.
 It
 was


it
 was
 Scott
 Horton
 and
 me
 who
 said
 that


he
 was
 an
 Israeli
 spy
 and
 it
 was
 Alan


Dersowitz
 and
 General
 Danny
 Ayalon,
 the


former
 head
 of
 Mossad.


Ayalon
 was
 kind
 of
 into
 it
 in
 terms
 of


having
 a
 fun
 time.
 He
 was
 just
 having
 a


fun
 time
 with
 the
 conversation.
 He


wasn't
 going
 to
 admit
 to
 anything.


Durowitz
 was
 Epstein's
 attorney.


So,
 I
 said
 that
 that
 I
 believed
 Epstein


was
 an
 Israeli
 spy.
 And
 Duritz


interrupts
 me
 like
 attorneys
 do.
 And
 he


says,
 "That
 is
 outrageous.
 If
 he
 had


been
 a
 spy,
 he
 would
 have
 told
 me


because
 I
 was
 his
 attorney
 and
 I
 could


have
 gone
 to
 the
 White
 House
 and
 I
 could


have
 gotten
 him
 a
 better
 sentence."
 And


I
 said,
 "Wait
 a
 minute.
 You
 could
 have


gone
 to
 the
 White
 House
 to
 say,
 "Go
 easy


on
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 because
 he's
 an


Israeli
 spy
 collecting
 information
 from


American
 politicians.
 If
 I
 were
 the


president,
 I
 would
 have
 hung
 him
 from
 a


tree."


And
 then
 Piers
 Morgan
 said,
 "General
 I


Allen,
 was
 he
 a
 spy?"
 And
 he
 goes,


"Who
 knows?


>> Who
 knows?"


>> It's
 like,
 come
 on,
 man.
 Who
 do
 you


think
 is
 the
 real
 adversary
 of
 the
 West?


Because
 we
 often
 talk
 about
 it
 being


Russia
 or


>> I
 think
 it's
 China.


>> Why?
 What
 is
 it
 that
 we
 don't
 realize


about
 China
 and
 their
 agenda?


>> Oh,
 wow.
 So
 much.
 The
 Chinese
 are
 so


good
 at
 what
 they
 do.
 And
 the
 Chinese


are
 so
 patient.
 You
 know,
 in
 the
 United


States,
 we
 we
 don't
 have
 long-term


timelines
 for
 for
 anything.
 When
 we
 want


something,
 we
 want
 it
 now.
 Is
 that
 in


part
 because
 we
 have
 this
 four-year


election
 cycle?


>> Yes,
 I
 believe
 that
 it
 is.
 The
 Chinese


will
 plan
 for
 something
 25
 years
 down


the
 road


>> because
 they
 all
 still
 be
 in
 power
 then.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 they're
 really


good
 at
 stealing
 technology.


There
 are
 more
 Chinese
 PhD
 students
 in


the
 hard
 hard
 sciences
 here
 in
 the


United
 States
 than
 you
 can
 shake
 a
 stick


at.
 They're
 everywhere.
 They're
 they're


at
 every
 major
 university
 and
 they're


really
 really
 smart.


And
 then
 often
 times
 they'll
 say,
 "Oh,


you
 know,
 I've
 had
 such
 a
 great


experience
 here.
 I'd
 like
 to
 stay
 in
 the


United
 States."
 Yeah,
 I
 bet
 you
 would.
 I


bet
 you
 would.
 So
 you
 can
 spy
 for
 China.


>> Do
 you
 think
 that's
 happening?


>> Every
 single
 day.


>> You
 think
 that
 Chinese
 students
 are
 in


America
 spying
 on
 behalf
 of
 China?


>> Yes.


>> Yes.


>> How
 could
 you
 be
 so
 sure?


>> I'm
 1,000%
 sure.


>> How
 could
 you
 be
 so
 sure?
 because
 we


frequently
 arrest
 them
 and
 then
 trade


them
 for
 Americans
 who
 are
 in
 Chinese


prisons.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 they're
 masquerading
 as
 students.


>> Mhm.
 PhD
 candidates
 always
 in
 the
 hard


sciences.
 Always.


>> So,
 China
 are
 the
 long-term
 adversary.


And
 what
 is
 it
 that
 China
 China
 want?


What
 is
 it
 they're
 doing?


>> And
 what
 is
 the
 outcome?


>> I
 think
 they
 want
 a
 couple
 of
 things.
 I


think
 that


on
 a
 more
 immediate
 basis
 they
 want


reunification
 with
 Taiwan.
 It's
 going
 to


happen
 someday.
 Even
 the
 Taiwanese
 will


tell
 you,
 "Yes,
 we're
 a
 part
 of
 China,


but
 we're
 kind
 of
 not
 a
 part
 of
 China.


We're
 not
 really
 independent,
 but
 we
 are


kind
 of
 independent."


Even
 American
 policy
 is
 that
 Taiwan
 is
 a


part
 of
 China,
 and
 eventually
 someday


they'll
 be
 reunited.
 Do
 you
 think
 with


everything
 that's
 going
 on
 at
 the
 moment


with
 Trump
 in
 Venezuela
 and
 Greenland,


this
 is
 going
 to
 create
 cover
 for


>> Oh,
 I
 was
 hoping
 you
 would
 ask
 me
 a


question
 like
 that.
 I
 think
 that's
 very


that's
 a
 very
 important
 issue
 that
 that


the
 media
 really
 aren't
 talking
 about.


So,


let's
 put
 it
 in
 the
 context
 of
 what


happened
 last
 week
 in
 Venezuela
 because


they're
 all
 moving
 parts
 of
 the
 same
 of


the
 same
 policy.


So,


we
 we
 sent
 a
 Delta
 Force
 squad
 into


Venezuela
 a
 week
 ago
 and
 we
 snatched


President
 Maduro
 and
 he
 faces


international
 narcotics
 trafficking


charges
 in
 New
 York.
 Okay.
 Some
 people


are
 for
 that,
 some
 people
 are
 against


it.
 Whether
 you're
 for
 it
 or
 against
 it,


it's
 happened.
 There's
 nothing
 we
 can
 do


about
 it
 now.
 But


that
 operation
 may
 have
 inadvertently


given
 the
 green
 light
 to
 something
 that


both
 the
 Russians
 and
 the
 Chinese
 have


long
 sought.
 The
 United
 States
 really
 is


the
 only
 true
 superpower
 in
 the
 world.


You
 know,
 the
 Chinese
 have
 a
 lot
 more


people.
 They
 have
 lots
 of
 nuclear


missiles,
 but
 they
 have
 one
 aircraft


carrier.
 We
 have
 12,
 soon
 to
 be
 14.
 We


have
 way
 more
 long-distance
 bombers.
 We


have
 way
 more
 fighters.
 The
 Russians
 are


bogged
 down
 in
 a
 war
 in
 in
 Ukraine.


They're
 winning
 the
 war,
 but
 they're


bogged
 down
 nonetheless.
 So,


did
 this
 did
 this
 reinstitution
 of
 the


Monroe
 Doctrine
 saying
 that,
 you
 know,


from
 1814
 that
 that
 the
 Western


Hemisphere
 is
 the
 is
 the
 territory
 of


the
 United
 States,
 it's
 up
 to
 us
 to


protect
 it
 from
 foreign
 powers.
 Well,
 in


1814,
 that
 meant
 the
 British
 Navy.
 We


don't
 really
 need
 a
 Monroe
 Doctrine
 and


it's
 not
 up
 to
 us
 whether
 the
 Argentines


want
 to
 have
 good
 relations
 with
 China


for
 example.


We
 invoked
 the
 Monroe
 Doctrine
 in
 this


operation
 to
 snatch
 Maduro.
 So
 does
 that


mean
 then
 that
 if
 we
 have
 a
 sphere
 of


influence
 that
 is
 the
 Western
 Hemisphere


that
 the
 Chinese
 have
 a
 sphere
 of


influence
 that
 includes
 Taiwan
 that
 the


Russians
 have
 a
 sphere
 of
 influence
 that


includes
 Ukraine?
 because
 that's
 kind
 of


what
 it
 seems.
 It
 looks
 like
 we've
 given


the
 green
 light
 to
 both
 of
 those


countries
 and
 that
 we're
 conceding
 the


fact
 that
 it's
 a
 unipolar
 world
 right


now
 in
 favor
 of
 a
 multipolar
 world.
 Now,


personally,
 I
 think
 a
 multipolar
 world


is
 safer.


>> What's
 a
 multipolar
 world?


>> Multipolar
 world
 is
 where
 there's
 not


just
 one
 superpower.
 There
 are
 three
 or


more.


So
 in
 terms
 of
 policy,
 this
 simple
 act


of
 just
 sending
 a
 team
 in
 to
 grab
 Maduro


has
 turned
 international
 diplomacy
 on


its
 head.


What
 do
 we
 do
 if
 the
 Chinese
 invade


Taiwan?
 Do
 we
 really
 want
 to
 send


American
 soldiers
 to,
 you
 know,
 to
 fight


and
 die
 for
 Taiwan?


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 would
 happen
 if
 China


tomorrow
 said,
 "You
 know what?
 We're


going to
 take
 Taiwan."


>> You
 know what?
 Honest
 to
 God,
 I
 think


nothing
 would
 happen.


I
 think
 we
 would
 rush
 to
 protect


Australia,
 Japan,
 South
 Korea,
 the


Philippines,
 Thailand.
 We'd
 rush
 to


protect
 them.


>> Why?


>> Because
 they're
 they're
 major
 non-NATO


allies.
 They're
 good
 friends,
 close


friends.
 But
 in
 terms
 of
 going
 to
 Taiwan


to
 fight
 Chinese
 soldiers,


I
 can't
 imagine
 it.


>> Trump
 told
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 that


whether
 China
 moves
 on
 Taiwan
 is


ultimately
 up
 to
 Chinese
 President
 Xi


Jonging.
 not
 the
 USA.
 Adding
 that
 he's


told
 he
 would
 be
 very
 unhappy
 if
 China


changed
 the
 status
 quo.
 He
 claimed
 he


doesn't
 think
 Xi
 will
 act
 while
 he's


president.


>> See,
 and
 that
 is
 actually
 what
 the


long-term
 policy
 is.
 The
 long-term


policy
 is
 sure
 someday


to
 be
 determined
 later
 you
 guys
 can


unify.


>> Just
 don't
 do
 it
 while
 I'm
 here.


>> Yeah.
 Don't
 do
 it
 today.


>> Maybe
 when
 Trump
 goes.


>> God
 forbid.


So
 going
 back
 to
 this
 point,
 you
 said


they
 want
 Taiwan.
 What
 else
 do
 you
 think


China
 want?


>> Well,


do
 they
 want
 to
 see
 the
 US
 fall?


>> Yes,
 sure.


>> And
 are
 they
 actively
 doing
 things
 to


encourage
 that?


>> Yes,
 but
 not
 the
 things
 that


that
 you
 would
 expect.


Instead
 of
 running
 around
 the
 world,
 you


know,
 overthrowing
 governments,
 invading


countries,
 which
 is
 what
 we
 do,


they
 go
 to
 countries
 and
 say,
 "Hey,
 you


need
 a
 new
 highway
 system,
 we'll
 pay
 for


it.
 You
 need
 a
 new
 airport,
 no
 problem.


You
 need
 a
 new
 hospital
 electrical
 grid,


we
 have
 plenty
 of
 money
 from
 our


gigantic
 trade
 surplus.
 We'll
 pay
 for


it.
 We
 just
 want
 to
 have
 really
 good,


friendly
 relations
 with
 you."
 And
 that's


what
 they
 do.
 The
 Chinese
 essentially


own
 Africa
 right
 now.


>> What
 are
 you
 most
 concerned
 about
 in
 the


world
 at
 the
 moment?
 What
 what
 does


actually
 keep
 you
 up
 at
 night?
 What


frightens
 me
 the
 most
 is
 that
 the
 US


government


over
 the
 last


well
 really
 over
 the
 last


50
 years
 or
 55
 years
 has
 so
 inflated
 its


military
 budget


that
 what
 we
 spend
 on
 the
 Pentagon
 is


now
 more
 than
 the
 next
 eight
 largest


countries
 combined.
 mind.


Right.


Donald
 Trump
 right
 now
 spends
 a
 a


trillion
 dollars
 a
 year
 on
 the
 Pentagon


budget.
 He's
 asking
 for
 next
 year
 to
 be


a
 trillion
 and
 a
 half.


We
 can't
 afford
 it.
 Our
 interest
 on
 the


national
 debt
 is
 now
 the
 third
 largest


expenditure
 in
 government
 between
 the


Pentagon
 and
 Social
 Security
 and
 then


the
 the
 interest
 on
 the
 debt.


>> And
 why
 does
 this
 bother
 you?


>> Because
 we're
 going
 bankrupt.
 And
 all


the
 while,
 the
 China,
 the
 Chinese
 are


letting
 us
 spend
 ourselves
 into


oblivion.
 The
 Chinese
 don't
 spend
 that


kind
 of
 money.
 How
 come
 I
 can't
 have
 a


bullet
 train
 that
 goes
 400
 miles
 an


hour?
 How
 come
 I
 can't
 get
 to
 Chicago
 in


3
 hours
 by
 train?
 You
 know,
 how
 come
 the


airports
 in
 my
 country
 look
 like
 [ __ ]


And
 you
 go
 to
 Chinese
 airports
 and


they're
 pristine
 with
 like
 the
 most


amazing
 services
 and
 the
 best


restaurants.
 How
 come
 Chinese
 roads


don't
 have
 potholes?
 And
 in
 my
 town,


it's
 like
 driving
 across
 Bosnia.


It's
 because
 they
 decided
 not
 to
 spend


their
 money
 on
 weapons.
 They
 spend
 it
 on


infrastructure.


>> Do
 you
 think
 that's
 likely
 that
 the
 US


could
 go
 bankrupt
 effectively?


>> I
 do.


Yeah,
 I
 do.
 We
 can't
 keep
 up
 this
 pace.


It's
 not
 possible.
 We're
 going
 to
 have


to
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 raise
 taxes


and
 cut
 the
 budget.


>> What's
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 that
 we


didn't
 talk
 about
 that
 we
 should
 have


talked
 about,
 John?


>> Oh,
 that's
 a
 good
 question.


One
 of
 the
 most
 important
 things
 in
 my


life
 to
 tell
 you
 the
 truth,
 uh,
 is
 the


issue
 of
 ethics.
 I
 love
 this
 country


more
 than
 anything
 else
 in
 the
 world,


and
 I
 wanted
 to
 do
 the
 right
 thing.


We're
 a
 country
 of
 laws
 and
 we
 have
 to


obey
 our
 laws,
 which
 is
 why
 I
 blew
 the


whistle
 on
 the
 torture
 program.


>> Who's
 not
 obeying
 the
 laws?


>> Our
 government.


>> In
 what
 way?


>> We've
 gotten
 to
 the
 point,
 and
 it


started
 around
 the
 year
 2000
 or
 2001.
 We


got
 to
 the
 point
 where
 if
 we
 want
 to
 do


something,
 we
 just
 do
 it.


>> Like
 what?
 In
 1946,


we
 passed
 something
 called
 the
 Federal


Torture
 Act,
 which
 banned
 torture.


Okay.
 Also
 in
 1946,


we
 executed


Japanese
 soldiers
 who
 waterboarded


American
 prisoners
 of
 war.
 That
 was
 a


death
 penalty
 offense
 to
 waterboard


someone.
 All right.
 In
 1968,
 on
 January


the
 11th,
 1968,


the
 Washington
 Post
 ran
 a
 front
 page


photograph
 of
 an
 American
 soldier


waterboarding
 a
 North
 Vietnamese


prisoner.
 When
 the
 when
 the
 picture
 ran,


the
 Secretary
 of
 Defense,
 Robert


McNamera,
 ordered
 an
 immediate


investigation.
 That
 soldier
 was


arrested.
 He
 was
 charged
 with
 torture


and
 he
 was
 sentenced
 to
 20
 years
 of
 hard


labor
 at
 Levvenworth.


And
 then
 in
 2002,


it's
 legal.
 We
 can
 do
 it.
 We
 can
 do
 it


because
 we're
 the
 good
 guys.


The
 law
 never
 changed.
 We
 changed.
 And


my
 point
 was
 always
 either
 we're
 going


to
 be
 the
 good
 guys
 or
 we're
 not.
 Either


we're
 going
 to
 be
 what
 Ronald
 Reagan


called
 a
 shining
 city
 on
 a
 hill
 or
 we're


not.
 It
 when
 I
 was
 when
 I
 was
 stationed


in
 Bahrain,
 I
 was
 the
 human
 rights


officer.
 So,
 I
 had
 to
 write
 the
 human


rights
 report
 every
 year
 that
 we
 sent
 to


Congress.
 Well,
 imagine


if
 John
 goes
 in
 to
 see
 the
 Minister
 of


Interior.
 And
 I
 say,
 "Your
 Highness,
 you


cannot
 pick
 up
 a
 15-year-old
 kid
 for


marching
 in
 a
 peaceful
 pro-democracy


demonstration
 and
 then
 murder
 him,
 beat


him
 to
 death
 in
 the
 in
 the
 police


station,
 and
 call
 his
 parents
 to
 come


and
 pick
 up
 the
 body."
 You
 can't
 do


that.
 I
 have
 to
 report
 that
 to
 Congress


and
 you're
 going
 to
 lose
 your
 your


rights
 to
 buy
 American
 military


hardware.
 But
 then
 the
 CIA
 station
 chief


goes
 in
 an
 hour
 later
 and
 says,
 "Don't


pay
 any
 attention
 to
 the
 human
 rights


guy.
 I'll
 give
 you
 $10
 million.
 If
 you


set
 up
 a
 secret
 prison
 here,
 we're
 going


to
 send
 you
 some
 prisoners.
 You
 torture


them
 and
 then
 you
 give
 us
 a
 write
 up
 of


everything
 they
 say
 during
 torture."


Who's
 he
 going
 to
 listen
 to?
 Is
 he
 going


to
 listen
 to
 me?


>> Did
 that
 happen?
 Yes.


He's
 not
 going to
 listen
 to
 me.


If
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 torture
 is
 legal
 just


cuz
 we
 say
 it
 is
 and
 then
 Congress
 is


like,
 "Oh,
 we
 don't
 know
 anything


because
 it's
 a
 secret
 program,
 so
 we


can't
 talk
 about
 it."


>> Do
 we
 still
 torture
 people?


>> No.


I
 am
 very
 proud
 to
 say
 that


when
 the
 McCain
 Feinstein
 anti-torrture


amendment
 was
 passed
 into
 law
 in


December
 of
 2014,
 John
 McCain
 got
 up
 on


the
 floor
 of
 the
 Senate
 and
 said
 it
 was


because
 of
 me,
 because
 of
 my


revelations.
 He
 said,
 "If
 I
 had
 not
 told


the
 American
 people
 that
 the
 CIA
 was


torturing
 prisoners
 in
 their
 name,


we
 would
 never
 have
 known."


That's
 why
 I
 say
 it
 was
 worth
 it.


>> Do
 you
 think
 you
 should
 be
 pardoned
 by


by
 President
 Trump?


>> I
 do.


>> Have
 you
 written
 him?


I've


I've


be
 careful
 with
 my
 language
 here.
 I


applied.
 My
 name
 is
 in
 the
 system.
 I


have
 very


very
 high
 level
 supporters


who
 have
 approached
 him
 personally


and
 I'm
 hopeful
 that
 it
 happens.


John,
 we
 have
 a
 closing
 tradition
 where


the
 last
 guest
 leaves
 a
 question
 for
 the


next
 not
 knowing
 who
 they're
 going
 to
 be


leaving
 it
 for.
 And
 the
 question
 left


for
 you
 is,
 what's
 something
 you
 stopped


doing
 that
 improved
 your
 life
 more
 than


anything
 you
 started?


feeling
 sorry
 for
 myself.


I
 I'll
 be
 honest
 with
 you.
 I
 have


struggled
 with
 depression
 my
 entire


life.


And
 after
 my
 second
 divorce,


I
 went
 through
 this
 period
 where
 I
 was


just
 I
 couldn't
 pull
 myself
 out
 of
 bed


in
 the
 morning
 because
 I
 felt
 so
 sorry


for
 myself.
 because
 of
 the
 divorce
 or


because
 of
 your
 life
 or
 because


>> the
 whole
 thing.
 I
 I
 believed
 I
 was
 just


a
 loser.
 I
 was
 in
 my
 50s,


unemployable,


convicted
 felon,
 barely
 able
 to
 make


ends
 meet,
 worried
 about
 where
 my
 rent


was
 coming
 from
 one
 month
 to
 the
 next.


And
 then
 I
 thought,
 "Fuck
 you.
 What's


wrong
 with
 you?


You
 don't
 have
 to
 answer
 to
 anybody."


And
 I
 I
 told
 myself
 no
 more
 feeling


sorry
 for
 myself.
 I
 was
 going
 to
 go
 make


a
 career
 on
 my
 own.
 And
 so
 I
 knew
 I


would
 never
 work
 for
 government
 again.
 I


knew
 I
 would
 never
 work
 in
 corporate


America
 again.
 After
 I
 left
 the
 CIA,
 I


was
 the
 head
 of
 the
 competitive


intelligence
 practice
 at
 Deote
 and
 Touch


spying
 on
 Ernstston
 Young
 and
 PWC
 and


IBM.
 And
 it
 was
 great
 fun.
 I'll
 never


work
 in
 in
 the
 corporate
 world
 again.
 So


I
 decided
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 what
 I'm
 good


at.


and
 I'm
 a
 I'm
 a
 terrific
 writer
 and
 I'm


told
 that
 I'm
 a
 gifted
 storyteller.
 So,


I'm
 going
 to
 write
 books.
 I
 have
 two


syndicated
 newspaper
 columns
 that
 run
 in


212
 small
 town
 papers
 around
 the


country.
 I'm
 on
 TV
 all
 the
 time.
 I
 have


three
 podcasts,
 Drogram,
 every
 day
 on
 on


both
 YouTube
 and
 Rumble.
 Thanks
 for


letting
 me
 plug
 them
 by
 the
 way.


>> Go
 ahead.


>> Uh
 Deep
 Focus
 on
 YouTube
 and
 on
 Apple


Podcast.
 John
 Kuryaku's
 Dead
 Drop,
 which


is
 just
 story
 after
 story
 after
 story.


And
 now
 I
 make
 a
 perfectly
 great
 living.


I
 I'm
 in
 a
 long-term
 relationship
 with


the
 woman
 I'm
 crazy
 about,
 and
 life
 is


good.


>> And
 it
 all
 started
 with
 that
 decision
 to


stop
 feeling
 sorry
 for
 yourself.


>> Yes.
 If
 people
 around
 me
 keep
 saying,


"You've
 done
 nothing
 wrong.
 You're
 a


hero
 for
 what
 you
 did."
 And
 deep
 down,
 I


would
 do
 it
 again,
 then
 why
 am
 I
 feeling


sorry
 for
 myself?
 I'm
 right.
 They're


wrong.
 They're
 criminals.
 So,
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 go
 on
 with
 my
 life.
 And
 that


snapped
 me
 out
 of
 it.


So,
 don't
 feel
 sorry
 for
 yourself.


Do
 something
 about
 it.


Act.


>> John,
 you
 are
 someone
 that
 is
 very
 good


at
 storytelling.
 You
 are.
 You've
 written


many
 books.
 I'm
 going
 to
 link
 all
 the


books
 below.
 So
 many
 incredible
 books.


I've
 got
 some
 of
 them
 here
 with
 me
 on


the
 floor.
 Um,
 I
 could
 go
 through
 all
 of


them,
 but
 we
 need
 another
 couple
 of


days.
 Um,
 John,
 thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 your
 incredible


storytelling,
 your
 wisdom,
 but
 also
 just


giving
 us
 a
 window
 into
 a
 world
 that


most
 of
 us
 know
 nothing
 about
 because


there's
 so
 many
 lessons
 that
 I
 think
 are


pertinent
 to
 all
 of
 our
 lives
 riddled


amongst
 there.
 And
 I
 think,
 you
 know,


I
 hope
 you
 do
 get
 pardoned.


>> Thank
 you.
 I
 hope
 so.
 I've
 got
 my


fingers
 crossed.


>> And
 when
 you
 do,
 hopefully
 we
 can
 come


back
 again
 and
 have
 another


conversation.


>> I
 look
 forward
 to
 that.
 It's
 been
 such
 a


pleasure.


>> Pleasure
 is
 mine.
 Thanks
 for
 the


invitation.


>> This
 is
 something
 that
 I've
 made
 for


you.
 I
 realize
 that
 the
 direio
 audience


are
 striv


goals
 that
 we
 want
 to
 accomplish.
 And


one
 of
 the
 things
 I've
 learned
 is
 that


when
 you
 aim
 at
 the
 big
 big
 big
 goal,
 it


can
 feel
 incredibly
 psychologically


uncomfortable
 because
 it's
 kind
 of
 like


being
 stood
 at
 the
 foot
 of
 Mount
 Everest


and
 looking
 upwards.
 The
 way
 to


accomplish
 your
 goals
 is
 by
 breaking


them
 down
 into
 tiny
 small
 steps.
 And
 we


call
 this
 in
 our
 team
 the
 1%.
 And


actually
 this
 philosophy
 is
 highly


responsible
 for
 much
 of
 our
 success


here.
 So
 what
 we've
 done
 so
 that
 you
 at


home
 can
 accomplish
 any
 big
 goal
 that


you
 have
 is
 we've
 made
 these
 1%
 diaries


and
 we
 released
 these
 last
 year
 and
 they


all
 sold
 out.
 So
 I
 asked
 my
 team
 over


and
 over
 again
 to
 bring
 the
 diaries
 back


but
 also
 to
 introduce
 some
 new
 colors


and
 to
 make
 some
 minor
 tweaks
 to
 the


diary.
 So
 now
 we
 have
 a
 better
 range
 for


you.
 So
 if
 you
 have
 a
 big
 goal
 in
 mind


and
 you
 need
 a
 framework
 and
 a
 process


and
 some
 motivation,
 then
 I
 highly


recommend
 you
 get
 one
 of
 these
 diaries


before
 they
 all
 sell
 out
 once
 again.
 And


you
 can
 get
 yours
 now
 at
 the
 diary.com


where
 you
 can
 get
 20%
 off
 our
 Black


Friday
 bundle.
