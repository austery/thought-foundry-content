Hello
 my
 friends.
 Today
 is
 December
 6th


and
 this
 is
 Markets
 Weekly.
 First
 off,


it's
 great
 to
 see
 everyone
 again.
 I
 hope


everyone
 had
 a
 relaxing
 Thanksgiving


week.
 Now,
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks,


markets
 have
 been
 kind
 of
 quiet.
 Price


action
 has
 been
 kind
 of
 rangebound.
 We


did
 see
 the
 major
 equity
 indexes
 trend
 a


bit
 higher.
 And
 personally,
 I
 still


think
 there's
 a
 good
 chance
 that
 we


could
 hit
 S&P
 500
 7,000
 on
 the
 S&P
 500


by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.


The
 really
 interesting
 stuff
 though


happened
 on
 the
 policy
 front.
 So
 last


week,
 President
 Trump
 all
 but
 promised


that
 the
 next
 Fed
 chair
 would
 be
 Kevin


Hasset.
 And
 Secretary
 Basson
 seems
 to
 be


hinting
 on
 his
 next
 plan
 to
 have
 more


control
 over
 the
 Federal
 Reserve.
 So


let's
 talk
 about
 developments
 on
 the
 Fed


front.
 Secondly,
 and
 I
 think
 this
 is


super
 super
 revolutionary,
 was
 that
 the


White
 House
 released
 its
 national


security
 strategy.
 Now,
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 was


stuff
 that
 we've
 been
 seeing,
 America


first
 and
 so
 forth,
 but
 it
 had
 some


really
 interesting
 things
 to
 say
 when
 it


came
 to
 Europe
 and
 actually
 reading


between
 the
 lines.
 Um,
 and
 honestly,
 it


sounds
 like
 regime
 change
 from
 my


perspective.
 So,
 let's
 take
 a
 look
 at


that
 document.
 All
 right,
 starting
 with


the
 Fed.
 So
 last
 week
 the
 Wall
 Street


Journal
 reported
 that
 uh
 President
 Trump


basically
 cancelled
 the
 second
 round


interviews
 for
 Fed
 chair
 and
 that
 he
 had


and
 President
 Trump
 suggested
 he
 had


narrow
 down
 candidates
 to
 one
 person
 and


that
 it
 would
 be
 announced
 in
 early


February.
 Now
 he
 also
 had
 this
 thing
 to


say
 at
 a
 recent
 conference.


>> I
 guess
 a
 potential
 Fed
 chair
 is
 here


too.
 I
 don't
 know
 who
 he's
 allowed
 to


say
 that
 potential.


He's
 a
 respected
 person
 that
 I
 can
 tell


you.
 Thank
 you,
 Kevin.


>> Uh
 so
 basically
 there's
 uh
 you
 know


we've
 already
 narrow
 down
 the
 Fed
 to
 one


candidate.
 Oh
 by
 the
 way
 Kevin
 Hassid


potential
 candidate
 great
 guy.
 So
 that


kind
 of
 tells
 you
 all
 you
 need
 to
 know.


If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 betting
 markets
 it's


very
 clear
 that
 everyone
 is
 becoming


increasingly
 confident
 that
 Kevin
 Hassid


will
 indeed
 be
 the
 next
 Fed
 chair.
 So


who
 is
 Kevin
 Hassid?
 Well,
 Kevin
 Hassik


is
 basically
 the
 president's
 longtime


economic
 adviser
 who's
 actually
 been


there
 for
 um
 over
 a
 decade
 now.
 So,
 if


you
 look
 at
 his
 credentials,
 he's


definitely
 someone
 that
 is
 wellqualified


to
 be
 Fed
 Chair.
 He
 has
 a
 you
 know
 an


econ
 from
 a
 fancy
 university.
 He's


worked
 at
 the
 Fed
 before.
 He's
 held


positions
 in
 uh
 influential
 conservative


think
 tanks.
 He's
 been
 in
 a
 part
 of
 the


establishment
 um
 I
 guess
 mainstream


Republican
 economic
 thinking
 for
 some


time
 being
 economic
 adviserss
 to


presidential
 candidate
 Mitt
 Romney,


presidential
 candidate
 Mitt
 McCain
 and


so
 forth.
 And
 around
 the
 time
 of
 the
 uh


President
 Trump's
 first
 term,
 he
 found


his
 way
 into
 President
 Trump's
 sphere.


And
 I
 guess
 that
 bet
 has
 really
 paid
 off


in
 spades.
 He
 rolled
 that
 Trump
 train


first
 as
 chairman
 of
 the
 Council
 of


Economic
 Advisors
 during
 Trump's
 first


term.
 currently
 uh
 president
 of
 the


National
 Economic
 Council,
 President


Trump's
 current
 term,
 and
 now
 it
 looks


like
 he's
 going
 to
 be
 Fed
 chair.
 So
 all


these
 positions
 very
 much
 what
 you
 would


expect
 for
 to
 see
 in
 someone
 who
 ends
 up


as
 Fed
 chair.
 For
 example,
 Berneni
 and


Yelen
 were
 also
 previously
 chairman
 of
 U


Council
 of
 Economic
 Advisors,
 you
 know,


fancy
 academic
 credentials
 and
 so
 forth.


So
 on
 paper
 totally
 totally
 um


reasonable
 choice.
 Now
 president
 will


often
 say
 that
 he
 really
 prefers


Secretary
 Vessent
 to
 be
 Fed
 chair
 and
 so


forth.
 Um
 but
 you
 know
 Secretary
 Bessant


just
 isn't
 interested
 really
 likes
 being


Treasury
 Secretary
 and
 if
 the


announcement
 is
 not
 made
 until
 early


January.
 It
 looks
 like
 Trump
 still
 has
 a


few
 weeks
 to
 convince
 him.
 Um
 doesn't


look
 like
 it's
 going
 to
 happen
 though.


So
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 to
 have
 Chair


Hassid?
 Well,
 obviously
 it's
 going
 to


mean
 that
 the
 Trump
 the
 Fed
 is
 going
 to


be
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 dovish
 than
 you


would
 expect.
 Right
 now,
 I'm
 not
 saying


that
 suddenly
 Chair
 Hasset
 is
 going
 to


cut
 rates
 to
 zero
 and
 you
 know


everything
 is
 going
 to
 go
 to
 the
 moon.


But
 when
 you're
 making
 economic
 policy,


there
 is
 always
 always
 a
 lot
 of
 um


flexibility
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 judgment
 is


discretionary.
 For
 example,


how
 restrictive
 is
 current
 monetary


policy?
 you
 know,
 well,
 you
 know,
 we're


around
 4%,
 uh,
 housing
 is
 in
 recession,


but
 then
 again,
 equity
 markets
 are
 going


to
 the
 moon.
 So,
 uh,
 I
 don't
 know,
 uh,


modestly,
 moderately,
 mildly,
 not


restrictive.
 So,
 you
 have
 a
 wide
 range


of
 views
 on
 this
 and
 you
 could
 easily


just
 have
 someone
 that's
 that
 says
 that


actually
 we're
 super
 restrictive
 as


Governor
 Myin
 would
 say,
 and
 that
 would


argue
 for
 lower
 rates.
 You
 can
 also
 have


someone
 who
 values
 the
 employment


mandate
 much
 more
 highly
 than
 the


inflation
 mandate.
 Again,
 having
 these


two
 mandates
 really
 gives
 the
 Fed
 a
 lot


of
 flexibility
 in
 balancing
 them.
 So,


you
 could
 easily
 have
 a
 chair
 Hasset
 who


says
 that,
 you
 know,
 my
 heart
 goes
 out


to
 all
 the
 struggling
 Americans.
 Labor


market
 is
 not
 good
 for
 many
 people.
 So,


I
 want
 to
 cut
 rates.
 So,
 you
 know,
 not


saying
 they
 can
 cut
 rates
 zero,
 but
 you


can
 easily
 see
 a
 path
 of
 policy
 that
 is


lower
 than
 it
 would
 be
 under
 say
 a
 POW


Fed.
 So,
 that
 I
 think
 is
 very
 uh
 likely


to
 happen.
 But
 again,
 many
 people
 will


also
 note
 that
 the
 Fed
 is
 not
 one


person.
 It's
 just
 not
 the
 Fed
 chair.
 You


have
 governors,
 you
 have
 presidents
 that


vote
 on
 a
 rotating
 basis,
 and
 some
 of


them
 are
 pretty
 hawkish.


And
 it
 looks
 like
 Secretary
 Besson
 is


suggesting
 a
 plan
 for
 them.
 Let's
 listen


to
 what
 he
 said
 at
 a
 New
 York
 Times


interview
 last
 week.
 The
 Federal
 Reserve


presidents
 in
 the
 regional
 banks
 were


meant
 to
 be
 from
 their
 district.
 And
 now


there's
 this
 idea
 of
 importing
 a
 like


bright
 shiny
 object
 and
 three
 of
 the


Federal
 Reserve
 member
 the
 uh
 for
 the


regional
 banks
 two
 of
 them
 used
 to
 work


at
 the
 New
 York
 Fed.
 One
 of
 them
 was
 on


a
 committee
 at
 the
 New
 York
 Fed
 was
 in
 a


New
 York
 investment
 bank.
 So,
 do
 they


represent
 their
 district?
 So,
 I
 I
 I
 am


going
 to
 start
 advocating


going
 forward,
 not
 retroactively,


that
 regional
 Fed
 presidents
 must
 have


lived
 in
 their
 district
 for
 at least
 3


years.


>> So,
 basically,
 Secretary
 Besson
 is


complaining
 that
 the
 way
 that
 the


Federal
 Reserve
 Bank
 presidents
 are


currently
 appointed
 is
 not
 in
 line
 with


how
 they
 should
 be.
 He's
 saying
 that


historically,
 you
 know,
 let's
 say
 that


you
 are
 a
 Federal
 Reserve
 president
 from


Cleveland
 or
 from
 from
 Texas.
 Well,
 you


know,
 you're
 supposed
 to
 represent
 the


interests
 of
 your
 region
 just
 like
 a


congressman
 of
 Nevada
 would
 should
 be


representing
 interests
 of
 Nevada
 in


Washington.
 But
 what's
 happening
 right


now
 is
 that
 say
 some
 of
 these
 fed


presidents
 are
 not
 actually
 from
 their


district,
 don't
 actually
 know
 anything


about
 their
 district.
 they're
 just
 kind


of
 people
 that
 parachuted
 in
 from
 New


York.
 So,
 we
 should
 change
 that.
 Now,


that
 sounds
 totally
 reasonable,
 right?


We
 want
 to
 have
 this
 regional


representation
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 uh


interests
 all
 across
 America
 are


represented
 at
 the
 Fed.
 Uh
 but
 when
 you


kind
 of
 look
 into
 it,
 you'll
 see
 that


well,
 who
 is
 he
 talking
 about?
 Ah,
 well,


for
 example,
 President
 Beth
 Hammock
 of


the
 Cleveland
 Fed


don't
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 have
 any


connection
 to
 that
 region
 as
 far
 as
 I


can
 see.
 Spent
 decades
 in
 Goldman
 Sachs,


right?
 Working
 in
 Goldman
 Sachs
 in
 New


York
 City,
 just
 kind
 of
 parachuted
 there


in
 Cleveland.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 she
 also


happens
 to
 be
 very,
 very
 hawkish.


Uh,
 you
 could
 probably
 make
 the
 case
 for


um,
 President
 Lori
 Logan
 in
 Texas
 as


well.
 Spent
 decades
 living
 and
 working


in
 New
 York
 at
 the
 New
 York
 Fed.


suddenly
 finds
 herself
 in
 Texas.
 Does


she
 have
 any
 connection
 to
 nexus?
 Not


that
 I'm
 aware
 of.
 Uh
 and
 now
 also


coincidentally
 very
 very
 hawkish.
 Now,


Secretary
 Besson
 says
 he's
 not
 going
 to


apply
 these
 rules
 retroactively.
 So


we're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 a
 situation


where
 like
 Lisa
 Cook
 where
 he
 trying
 to


get
 rid
 of
 them,
 but
 they
 all
 are
 up
 for


reappointment
 in
 February.
 And
 I
 don't


know
 if
 he's
 able
 to
 enforce
 this
 rule


to
 get
 enough
 buyin
 from
 the
 Federal


Reserve
 Board,
 but
 you
 know,
 it's
 it's


just
 another
 kind
 of


pathway
 to
 get
 more
 control
 over
 the


Fed.
 Kind
 of
 like
 how
 there's
 a
 lawsuit


against
 U.
 Lisa
 Cook
 pending
 before
 the


Supreme
 Court,
 whereas
 the
 president
 is


alleging
 that,
 you
 know,
 Lisa
 Cook
 did


something
 wrong
 with
 her
 mortgage


documents,
 so
 she
 shouldn't
 be
 a
 Fed


governor.
 And
 we'll
 have
 the
 Supreme


Court
 decide
 that.
 But
 again,
 this
 is
 an


administration
 that
 is
 very
 resourceful


and
 very
 determined
 to
 have
 more
 control


of
 the
 Federal
 Reserve.
 They
 view
 lower


interest
 rates
 as
 a
 high
 priority.
 So,


is
 this
 plan
 going
 to
 work?
 I
 have
 no


idea.
 But
 I
 suspect
 that
 the
 regional


Feds
 much
 easier
 to
 influence
 than
 the


Federal
 Reserve
 governors.
 Governors


are,
 you
 know,
 really
 a
 a
 position
 that


has
 to
 be
 confirmed
 by
 the
 Senate.


higher
 profile
 regional
 bank
 presidents


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 are


disappointments
 from
 the
 private
 sector


entities.
 So
 I
 do
 think
 that
 uh
 Trump


will
 have
 more
 influence
 over
 the
 Fed


next
 year.
 How
 much
 more
 you
 know
 we'll


just
 have
 to
 see
 how
 these
 paths
 pan


out.


So,
 um,
 and
 you
 kind
 of
 see,
 you
 know,


okay,
 so
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 market


reaction,
 it's
 kind
 of
 hard
 to
 see
 how


that
 could
 be
 cuz,
 you
 know,
 some
 people


would
 say
 that,
 uh,
 you'll
 lose
 long
 end


and
 so
 forth.
 But
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 if


you
 do
 have
 a
 politicized
 Fed,
 wouldn't


they
 just
 do
 like
 yield
 control
 or


something
 like
 that?
 Now,
 the


administration
 is
 aware
 that
 they
 don't


want
 the
 market
 to
 freak
 out.
 And
 so,


you
 do
 see
 the
 Treasury
 tweeting
 this


out
 the
 past
 week
 saying
 that
 the
 bottom


market
 loves
 President
 Trump.
 So,
 so
 far


at
 least
 it's
 not
 obvious
 to
 me
 that
 the


market
 is
 really
 concerned
 about


anything
 about
 the
 politization
 of
 the


Fed.
 So
 far,
 the
 price
 action,
 you
 know,


lower
 yields,
 weaker
 dollar,
 higher
 gold


is
 also
 consistent
 with
 um
 weaker
 labor


market,
 which
 you
 did
 have
 some
 weak


labor
 market
 news
 the
 past
 week.
 So,
 it


could
 be
 a
 situation
 like
 Liberation


Day,
 which,
 you
 know,
 as
 I
 remember


heading
 into
 Liberation
 Day,
 many
 people


were
 were
 telling
 you
 that
 it
 was
 going


to
 be
 a
 big
 deal.
 uh
 market
 didn't


believe
 it
 and
 then
 and
 then
 we
 had
 some


big
 moves.
 So
 let's
 let's
 uh
 look


forward
 to
 see
 what
 happens
 next
 year.


Now
 the
 second
 thing
 I
 want
 to
 talk


about
 is
 this
 super
 super
 interesting


national
 uh
 security
 strategy
 document


from
 the
 White
 House.
 Here
 it
 is.
 White


House
 spelling
 out
 what
 they
 mean
 in


terms
 of
 America
 first
 foreign
 policy.


Now
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 stuff
 that
 we
 already


know.
 You
 know
 balancing
 global
 trade,


helping
 workers
 and
 so
 forth.
 And
 a
 lot


of
 the
 stuff
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 things.
 It's


stuff
 that
 we
 already
 see
 them
 doing,


but
 now
 they're
 just,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of


telling
 telling
 you
 how
 it
 is.
 For


example,
 there's
 a
 section
 that
 very


spells
 out
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 Trump


coralarily
 to
 the
 Monroe
 Doctrine.


The
 Monroe
 doctrine
 was
 something
 put


forth
 by
 President
 Monroe
 in
 the
 1800s.


And
 what
 the
 Monroe
 document
 said,
 and


it
 was
 directed
 towards
 the
 European


powers
 at
 the
 time,
 was
 that
 the


Americas
 belongs
 to
 the
 United
 States.


this
 is
 our
 backyard.
 We
 will
 have


control
 here.
 You
 stay
 out.
 At
 that


time,
 again,
 there
 were
 many
 European


colonies
 in
 the
 Americas,
 particularly


from
 Spain.
 And
 so,
 the
 America,
 the


United
 States
 was
 just
 telling
 European


powers
 to
 back
 off.
 We're
 not
 going
 to


meddle
 in
 your
 affairs
 and
 you
 stay
 out


of
 our
 sphere
 of
 influence.
 The
 United


States
 culturally
 speaking,
 for
 is


really
 more
 of
 an
 isolationist
 country.


We
 want
 to
 want
 to
 do
 our
 own
 thing.
 And


it
 really
 was
 um
 the
 political
 powers


that
 kind
 of
 drag
 the
 public
 into
 the


world
 wars.


So
 uh
 what
 we
 see
 today
 America
 as
 you


know
 kind
 of
 an
 empire
 is
 is
 kind
 of


more
 of
 an
 aberration
 when
 it
 comes
 to


American
 history.
 Now
 Trump
 is
 basically


saying
 that
 reaffirming
 that
 you
 know
 we


want
 to
 have
 influence
 over
 uh
 the


Americas
 and
 you
 already
 see
 that
 right?


So,
 uh,
 you
 have
 Treasury
 giving
 an


emergency
 loan
 to
 an
 ally
 in
 Argentina,


shoring
 up
 President
 Malay,
 who
 was
 a


friend
 of
 Washington,
 and
 you
 have
 Trump


setting
 out
 all
 sorts
 of
 uh,
 battleships


outside
 of
 Venezuela,
 uh,
 basically


trying
 to
 get
 Maduro
 out,
 and
 President


Maduro
 over
 there
 is
 not
 a
 friend
 of


Washington.
 So,
 he
 he's
 already
 doing


these
 things,
 right?
 He's
 just
 telling


you
 what
 we
 kind
 of
 have
 already


inferred
 in
 the
 document.
 He
 also
 spells


out
 some
 interesting
 things
 when
 it


comes
 to
 China.
 First
 off,
 he
 does
 note


that
 in
 Latin
 America,
 a
 lot
 of
 these


countries
 have,
 you
 know,
 strong


business
 relationships
 with
 China.
 Does


want
 to
 encourage
 these
 countries
 to,


you
 know,
 I'll
 say
 think
 long
 term
 and


try
 to
 make
 a
 case
 that
 it
 makes
 a
 lot


more
 sense
 for
 the
 United
 States
 to
 be


your
 best
 business
 partner
 in
 the
 long


term
 than
 these
 other
 people.
 He
 doesn't


actually
 name
 China,
 I
 don't
 believe.
 uh


but
 with
 regards
 to
 China
 does
 have


something
 to
 give
 to
 Ankushi
 and
 that
 is


reaffirms
 that
 uh
 Taiwan
 is
 just
 going


to
 stay
 as
 it
 is
 preserve
 the
 status
 quo


no
 clear
 support
 of
 Taiwan
 independence


and
 of
 course
 um
 no
 declaration
 that


China
 Taiwan
 is
 a
 province
 of
 China
 so


again
 just
 affirming
 we're
 going
 to
 keep


things
 as
 it
 is
 steady
 the
 ship
 and
 I


think
 that
 is
 you
 know
 uh
 probably
 makes


Akoshi
 happy


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 realistic
 to
 expect


that
 uh
 America
 would
 just
 give
 Taiwan


away,
 at least
 without
 getting
 something


a
 lot
 of
 things
 in
 return.
 Um
 but
 I


think
 what
 was
 most
 interesting
 in
 this


document
 is
 Trump's
 stance
 towards


Europe.
 In
 it,
 he's
 basically
 saying


that,
 you
 know,
 he
 thinks
 that
 the


democratic
 process
 in
 Europe
 is
 broken


and
 so
 that's
 why
 you're
 getting
 all


these
 bizarre
 outcomes.
 And
 the
 example


he
 he's
 giving
 is
 peace
 uh
 in
 Europe


whereas
 um
 you
 know
 the
 the
 population


in
 Europe
 overwhelmingly
 will
 like
 to


have
 peace
 but
 then
 all
 these
 elites
 who


are
 sitting
 on
 very
 thin
 margins
 are


just
 kind
 of
 pushing
 the
 Ukraine
 war
 and


he
 he
 doesn't
 like
 it
 and
 it
 actually


reminds
 me
 of
 a
 speech
 that
 Vice


President
 Vance
 gave
 a
 few
 months
 ago
 in


Munich.
 Let's
 listen
 to
 it
 where
 the


organizers
 of
 this
 very
 conference
 have


banned
 lawmakers
 representing
 populist


parties
 on
 both
 the
 left
 and
 the
 right


from
 participating
 in
 these


conversations.
 Now
 again,
 we
 don't
 have


to
 agree
 with
 everything
 or
 anything


that
 people
 say.
 But
 when
 people


represent
 when
 political
 leaders


represent
 an
 important
 constituency,
 it


is
 incumbent
 upon
 us
 to
 at
 least


participate
 in
 dialogue
 with
 them.
 Now,


to
 many
 of
 us
 on
 the
 other
 side
 of
 the


Atlantic,
 it
 looks
 more
 and
 more
 like


old
 entrenched
 interests
 hiding
 behind


ugly
 Soviet
 era
 words
 like


misinformation
 and
 disinformation
 who


simply
 don't
 like
 the
 idea
 that
 somebody


with
 an
 alternative
 viewpoint
 might


express
 a
 different
 opinion
 or
 god


forbid
 vote
 a
 different
 way
 or
 even


worse
 win
 an
 election.


So
 what
 he's
 saying
 is
 something
 that
 I


think
 from
 his
 perspective
 feels
 uh
 kind


of
 like
 a
 dja
 vu.
 So
 what
 he's
 saying
 of


course
 is
 that
 all
 these
 people
 in


Europe
 they
 are
 basically
 incumbents.


They
 have
 the
 political
 power.
 They


don't
 want
 to
 give
 it
 up
 and
 they're
 you


know
 rigging
 the
 system
 so
 that
 they


stay
 in
 power
 and
 it's
 causing


tremendous
 damage
 uh
 to
 their
 to
 to


their
 people
 to
 their
 economies
 because


their
 policies
 just
 don't
 work.
 Now,


this
 is
 something
 I
 think
 he
 feels


strongly
 about
 because
 he
 thinks
 that's


what
 happened
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Now,


this
 is
 something
 that's
 totally
 human


and
 we
 see
 this
 all
 all
 over
 the
 world


in
 in
 all
 over
 in
 any
 organization,


right?
 If
 you're
 a
 boomer
 and
 say
 a
 big


Fortune
 500
 company,
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of


benefits,
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 power
 in


making
 a
 lot
 of
 money,
 you
 don't
 want
 to


give
 it
 up.
 And
 so,
 you
 you
 kind
 of
 use


your
 power
 to
 protect
 your
 p
 position.


You
 see
 this
 in
 United
 States
 Congress


as
 well.
 You
 have
 all
 these
 people
 who


are,
 you
 know,
 sometimes
 seen
 now,
 but


you
 know,
 just
 cling
 on
 to
 their
 seats,


not
 wanting
 to
 let
 go
 of
 their
 power
 and


just
 kind
 of
 using
 the
 machine
 that
 they


built
 up
 the
 same
 power.
 Not
 sure
 if


these
 guys
 even
 understand
 what
 they're


doing,
 but
 you
 know,
 they
 they
 don't


want
 to
 leave.
 And
 that's
 obviously
 not


in
 the
 interest
 of
 United
 States.
 And
 of


course,
 when
 Trump
 was
 running
 for


election,
 you
 had
 tremendous
 tremendous


opposition


from
 established
 powers.
 You
 have
 uh
 for


example,
 you
 had
 all
 these
 officials


from
 state
 governors
 come
 out
 and
 say


that
 Trump
 was
 a
 bad
 person.
 We
 got
 to


get
 him
 off
 the
 ballot.
 Uh
 you
 had
 all


these
 lawsuits
 put
 out
 against
 them
 that


were
 uh
 in
 many
 cases
 just
 totally


totally
 frivolous.
 So
 basically
 the


weaponization
 of
 government
 power,
 the


judicial
 uh
 system
 against
 Trump
 and
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 he
 he
 did
 prevail.


And
 so
 if
 you're
 from
 the
 Trump
 team,


you
 really
 feel
 that
 you
 know
 this
 is


something
 that
 is
 a
 problem.
 And
 then


you
 look
 at
 Europe.
 What's
 happening
 in


Europe?
 You
 see
 that
 well
 you
 look
 at
 in


Germany
 for
 example
 you
 see
 that
 one
 of


the
 most
 popular
 political
 parties
 in


Germany
 the
 major
 opposition
 party
 AFD.


Well
 the
 government
 there
 is
 thinking


about
 banning
 them
 right
 just
 ban
 your


political
 opposition.
 It
 doesn't
 seem


democratic
 right
 you
 look
 at
 Romania


where
 the
 candidate
 who
 was
 poised
 to


win
 was
 more
 sympathetic
 towards
 Russia.


Well
 that
 conction
 got
 anoldled
 right.


So
 uh
 then
 you
 look
 at
 maybe
 France
 you


know
 looks
 like
 uh
 Le
 Pen's
 party
 was


most
 popular
 parliament
 in
 France
 and


then
 somehow
 the
 establishment
 works


together
 with
 other
 powers
 to
 kind
 of


push
 them
 out
 of
 power.
 So
 you
 get
 the


sense
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 guys
 are


running
 a
 running
 policies
 that
 don't


work
 and
 war
 on
 Ukraine,
 mass
 migration,


uh
 shutting
 down
 nuclear
 energy
 plants


when
 you
 have
 a
 energy
 crisis
 is
 is
 just


not
 good
 policy.
 But
 usually
 you
 would


expect
 there
 to
 be
 some
 sort
 of


democratic
 you
 know
 mechanism
 where
 uh


old
 management
 can
 be
 swept
 out
 to
 get


new
 management
 in
 to
 steer
 the
 country


towards
 a
 better
 direction.
 But
 that


doesn't
 always
 happen
 because
 old


management
 has
 powerful
 political


powers.
 And
 it
 looks
 like
 the


administration
 thinks
 that
 the
 reason


that
 that
 the
 Europe
 can't
 change
 course


is
 that
 these
 these
 established
 powers


are
 blocking
 the
 the
 mechanisms


preventing
 it
 from
 working.


And
 that's
 kind
 of
 a
 big
 difference


between
 Europe
 and
 the
 US.
 In
 in
 the
 US,


we
 all
 know
 that
 we
 have
 a
 more
 dynamic


economy,
 right?
 Uh
 for
 example,
 a


company
 can
 easily
 fire
 all
 its
 workers.


And
 that
 dynamism
 is,
 you
 know,
 it's
 sad


to
 lose
 your
 job,
 but
 it
 also
 allows


businesses
 to,
 you
 know,
 quickly
 right


size.
 It
 makes
 the
 company
 more


competitive
 and
 it
 allows
 workers
 to
 go


and
 um,
 you
 know,
 find
 skills
 that
 more


find
 jobs
 that
 more
 uh
 suit
 them
 more,


right?
 So,
 it's
 uh
 it's
 more
 of
 a


competitive,
 more
 of
 a
 brutal
 landscape.


And
 competition,
 you
 know,
 it
 has
 costs


and
 minuses.
 One
 of
 the
 pluses
 of
 course


is
 competition
 breeds
 more
 economic


growth,
 more
 uh
 I
 guess
 productivity.
 So


that's
 the
 same
 in
 the
 US
 political


system
 as
 well.
 So
 for
 example,


President
 Trump,
 he
 went
 and
 he


challenged
 the
 Bush
 dynasty
 during
 the


Republican
 primary.
 Right
 at
 that
 time,


the
 Bush
 name
 was
 very
 very
 powerful.


You
 had
 George
 Bush,
 George
 HW
 Bush.


There
 were
 two
 presidents
 from
 that


family
 and
 you
 had
 Jeb
 Bush
 who
 wanted


to
 be
 presidential
 candidate
 in
 2016
 for


the
 Republican
 party,
 former
 governor
 of


Florida.
 And
 you
 know,
 this
 guy
 is
 a


huge
 name,
 nice
 guy.
 And
 you
 know,
 just


Trump,
 this
 guy
 from
 reality
 TV
 just


kind
 of
 kind
 of
 totally
 ate
 his
 lunch


and
 it
 was
 honestly
 wasn't
 even
 close.


And
 you
 had
 basically
 one
 set
 of
 elites


in
 the
 Republican
 party
 totally


vanquished
 in
 that
 side
 that
 that
 part


of
 the
 party
 believed
 in
 things
 like
 you


know
 free
 trade
 and
 so
 forth
 and
 now
 the


Republican
 party
 doesn't
 believe
 in
 that


at
 all.
 So
 you
 had
 a
 very
 fluid,
 a
 very


dynamic
 political
 system
 where
 one
 group


of
 people
 was
 able
 to
 uh
 really
 take


over
 the
 Republican
 party
 and
 of
 course


take
 over
 the
 nation
 by
 defeating


another
 very
 powerful
 political
 dynasty,


the
 Clintons.
 And
 today,
 America
 has
 a


very
 different
 trajectory
 today
 than
 it


did
 in
 the
 past.
 You
 have
 different


people
 in
 power,
 much
 more
 influential


tech
 sector,
 for
 example.
 You
 have,
 you


know,
 Elon,
 you
 have,
 um,
 Jensen
 Hang,


all
 these
 people
 hanging
 out
 in
 the


White
 House,
 a
 White
 House
 policy
 that's


much
 more
 pro
 tech,
 and
 you
 have
 a
 White


House
 that's,
 you
 know,
 uh,
 has
 very


different
 views
 on
 on
 trade.
 So,
 this
 is


a
 to
 very
 different
 views
 on
 um,
 energy


as
 well,
 right?
 You
 don't
 have
 any
 more


of
 this
 green
 stuff.
 You
 have
 drill
 baby


drill.
 We
 have
 a
 nuclear
 renaissance.


So,
 the
 US
 political
 system
 is
 fluid.


You
 have
 elites
 fighting
 it
 out
 and


different
 sets
 of
 elites
 taking
 power


and
 changing
 direction
 of
 the
 country.


The
 downside
 of
 this
 is
 that
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 policy
 volatility.
 You
 have,
 you


know,
 tariff
 on,
 tariff
 off,
 maybe
 the


next
 president,
 maybe
 president
 Accazio


Ortez
 uh
 takes
 all
 the
 tariffs
 off.
 I


don't
 know.
 But
 this
 makes
 it
 difficult


for
 anyone
 to
 plan.
 Uh
 and
 you
 know,
 it


kind
 of
 makes
 things
 chaotic.
 But
 the


good
 part
 of
 this
 is
 that
 if
 the
 nation


is
 heading
 towards
 uh
 a
 wrong
 direction,


it
 can
 change
 course,
 right?
 So
 we
 were


having
 tremendous
 tremendous
 amounts
 of


illegal
 immigration.
 That's
 not


happening
 anymore.
 And
 I
 and
 I
 think
 the


public
 broadly
 is
 happy
 about
 that.
 So


again,
 cost
 and
 minuses
 to
 this
 kind
 of


political
 system
 in
 Euroland
 because
 uh


I
 guess
 they
 prioritize
 stability.
 They


can't
 change
 course.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at


the
 economic
 data,
 it
 doesn't
 does
 seem


like
 they're
 heading
 to
 nowhere,
 right?


Low
 growth,
 higher
 social
 unrest,
 and


you
 know,
 a
 war
 that
 doesn't
 seem
 to


end.
 And
 so
 what
 is
 the
 administration


proposing?
 Well,
 it's
 kind
 of
 spelling


it
 out
 to
 you.
 They
 are
 quote
 unquote


cultivating


uh
 some
 resistance
 in
 Europe.
 What
 does


that
 mean?
 What
 does
 cultivating


resistance
 in
 Europe
 mean?


Uh,
 that
 sounds
 like
 regime
 change
 to


me.
 That
 sounds
 like,
 you
 know,
 color


revolution
 stuff,
 which
 is
 something
 the


United
 States
 has
 been
 doing
 for
 decades


across
 the
 world,
 especially
 in
 Latin


America.
 And
 what
 the
 United
 States
 does


very
 well,
 right?
 You
 know,
 you
 have


this
 government
 that
 pops
 up
 in
 some


kind
 of
 u
 US
 sphere
 of
 influence
 and
 you


know,
 suddenly,
 you
 know,
 we
 have
 all


this
 propaganda
 campaign,
 bad
 things


happen
 or,
 you
 know,
 this
 guy
 just


disappears
 and
 so
 we
 have
 in
 place
 by
 a


US
 puppet.


It
 sounds
 like
 the
 US
 wants
 to
 do
 that


to
 Europe
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 truly


revolutionary
 because
 on
 the
 surface
 you


would
 say
 that
 US
 and
 Europe
 are
 are


allies.
 Maybe
 a
 few
 decades
 ago
 you
 can


even
 see
 them
 as
 equal
 partners
 but
 it's


very
 clear
 today
 that's
 not
 the
 case.
 uh


US
 is
 going
 and
 you
 know
 negotiating


peace
 directly
 with
 Russia
 totally


ignoring
 Europe
 telling
 them
 that
 you


guys
 don't
 matter
 and
 maybe
 they're


telling
 them
 today
 that
 you
 know
 we


think
 you
 are
 we
 want
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 you


and
 so
 what
 is
 that
 I
 mean
 that's
 just


kind
 of
 mindblowing
 and
 mind
 and
 really


changing
 how
 this
 and
 I
 actually
 think


they'll
 go
 to
 succeed
 because


a
 lot
 of the
 European
 current
 elite
 they


are
 losing
 popular
 support
 and
 you
 know


If
 you
 had
 maybe
 free
 elections,
 maybe


they
 would
 lose
 today.
 And
 maybe
 if
 you


have
 a
 huge
 propaganda
 campaign
 from
 the


CIA
 or
 something
 like
 that,
 maybe
 they


would
 definitely
 lose
 more.
 And
 well,


what
 would
 replace
 them?
 Someone
 that


thinks
 more
 like
 the
 US.
 And
 what
 would


that
 be?
 Ah,
 that'd
 be
 someone
 who
 um


doesn't
 like
 illegal
 immigration,


who
 is
 more
 businessoriented,
 who
 would,


you
 know,
 not
 so
 much
 in
 green
 energy,


would
 probably
 want
 to
 emphasize
 nuclear


power,
 less
 regulation,
 more


industrialization,


and
 and
 of
 course
 to
 be
 more


collaborative
 with
 Russia.
 Maybe
 we
 have


Russian
 gas
 again
 and
 so
 forth.
 So


maybe
 it's
 a
 good
 thing
 for
 for
 for


Euroland
 in
 the
 long
 run.
 And
 so
 I
 don't


know
 how
 this
 is
 going
 to
 turn
 out,
 but


I
 do
 think
 that
 this
 is
 a
 serious


turning
 point
 in
 the
 Atlantic


relationship
 and
 really
 it's
 going
 to
 be


so
 exciting
 to
 see
 how
 it
 turns
 out.
 All


right,
 so
 next
 week
 we
 have
 the
 Fed


meeting.
 Everyone
 knows
 Fed
 is
 going
 to


cut
 rates
 kind
 of
 signaled
 it
 and
 um


let's
 see
 uh
 I'll
 be
 back
 to
 talk
 about


what
 uh
 what
 my
 thoughts
 when
 that


happens.
 Outside
 chance
 that
 we
 could


have
 some
 maybe
 some
 signaling
 of
 when


the
 Fed
 is
 going
 to
 uh
 restart
 reserve


management
 purchases
 as
 well.
 All
 right,


I'll
 talk
 to
 you
 guys
 then.
