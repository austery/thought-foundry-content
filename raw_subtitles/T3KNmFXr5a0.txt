Hi everyone, I'm Anthony.
Welcome to my channel
Today's video
I want to talk to you about
Why is witch hunt mentality so prevalent in China?
And what is its underlying logic?
This topic will be discussed over several episodes.
Because I felt
witch hunt mentality
Actually, it's about our understanding of the Chinese people's mental state.
A key to social events
From Chinese history or contemporary society
We all seem to be able to observe
A peculiar cultural inertia
That is
Regardless of whether an idea originates from the West
Or the East
Once it enters the mass practice of Chinese society
They are all more easily modified and distorted.
And it evolved into a kind of witch hunt.
Or exorcism ritual
This illustrates
This psychological logic
Actually, it's something at a much deeper level.
As we said before
When we take a broader perspective
Let's look at many trends of thought in Chinese society
We will all find
Many of these were originally intended to inspire people to resist tyranny.
The theory of pursuing liberation and moving towards awakening
In reality, however, it has led to a strange situation.
That is
These theories
While empowering a segment of the population
But it might make another group of people
They became more deeply entangled in the victim's identity.
And paranoia
The parties involved are making continuous accusations.
In the process of that persecutory force
They did not become more motivated
On the contrary, it exacerbated the situation.
Their fear of that persecutory force
In other words
Many seemingly
It is a discourse that promotes the awakening of subjective consciousness.
Instead, it became a more covert method.
Symptoms of escaping subjectivity
For example, in the previous video
We analyzed the Chinese internet.
A critique of NPD
When many NPD victims
Through a critique of NPD
When they huddle together for warmth
They did not feel safer
Instead, I still feel uneasy.
Furthermore, they divided into factions and identified enemies.
There is a tendency to carry the revolution through to the end.
for example
In the NPD survivor community
Some people said
Be wary of bloggers who criticize NPD.
It may itself be NPD
Because according to the NPD classification standard
Characteristics of latent NPD
It's about playing the victim, complaining, and feigning grievance.
To try and gain other people's sympathy.
Manipulate others
This means
Some NPDs might be using the guise of a "red flag" to oppose the "red flag."
He emphasized that he was persecuted by the NPD.
But actually, he is the NPD.
This introduces the concept of NPD.
It has become all-encompassing.
Metaphysical concepts where subject and object are not differentiated
When standards become so vague and subjective
We can certainly do it on anyone.
Including finding its shadow in ourselves.
And this kind of exorcism ritual
This meant it was destined to be a battle that could never be won.
It will only plunge everyone into deeper suspicion.
and painful internal friction
So, this video...
Let's try to explore this topic in its initial stages.
I will upload this video.
Included in the list of "Psychology and Education"
If you have anything you'd like to discuss with me
And the topics of consultation
You can contact me via email to make an appointment.
First, in the comments section of the previous video...
A netizen left a message asking me:
Can you tell me?
Why do certain concepts, after entering China, [continue to influence China's development]?
It evolved into an all-encompassing, vague symbol.
I think this is an excellent question.
We can find
Many concepts that originally had precise definitions
After arriving in China
It began to become vague and exaggerated.
A key characteristic stemming from the witch-hunting mindset
That is the pursuit of absolute purity and innocence.
And in pursuit of this purity
There needs to be an equally absolute one.
An all-encompassing enemy
To be a target and take responsibility for all evil.
Typical example
That is, the communist movement of the 20th century.
In the Soviet Union, China, and Cuba
In the communist revolutions of Southeast Asia
We can find extremely similar patterns
That was at the beginning
The revolution attempted to eliminate external class enemies.
For example, landlords and capitalists
To achieve a pure and equal society
However, after the external enemies were eliminated...
The ideal society that was once promised
It did not come immediately.
For the leaders of the revolution
It is inconceivable to admit that the theory itself is flawed.
So they almost instinctively thought of
It must be because the enemy hasn't been completely eliminated yet.
They simply changed their form.
Enemies exposed from the outside
They became hidden enemies within.
therefore
The revolution still faces
Counterattack and retribution by hostile forces
The purity of the revolution remains under threat.
Thus, the spearhead of the revolution began to turn inward.
And it has differentiated into more subtle factions.
This led to endless infighting and purges.
To prove himself
"Revolutionary" and "Purity"
Different factions and individuals began to compete with each other.
The competition aims to identify and eliminate more and more hidden enemies.
Let's look at an article from the Cultural Revolution period.
People's Daily editorial
The title is
Carry the revolutionary mass criticism through to the end.
This article
This perfectly embodies the mindset of witch hunts.
For example, we see in the first paragraph...
After a year of struggle
We have defeated the biggest capitalist roader.
Achieved world-shaking achievements
But does this mean the struggle can stop?
Of course not
The article points out
This counter-revolutionary group
They will never truly lay down their arms and surrender.
Instead, they attempted to preserve their strength through a two-faced approach.
Waiting for the right opportunity
Attempting to make a comeback
This is alarming.
then
The article points out three attitudes of the counter-revolutionary group.
The first attitude is to deny everything.
tenacious resistance
This can be compared to
That kind of open boasting and
Overt NPD that belittles others
The second type of counter-revolutionary is one who superficially admits wrongdoing.
Behind the scenes, certain organizations are being manipulated.
A desperate struggle, deceiving the masses.
This is equivalent to being scheming.
High-performance NPD that forms cliques
The third type is to feign a pitiful and harmless appearance.
Attempting to deceive the people's sympathy
This corresponds to the kind of latent NPD.
In other words
One defined as a counter-revolutionary
Or the bourgeoisie
Regardless of his forceful defense of himself
Or just bow your head and confess.
None of this can lessen his guilt.
but
Although this editorial listed
Three forms of the enemy
But the one we hate and fear the most is the third type.
In other words, enemies who are adept at disguising themselves as revolutionary masses.
As stated later in the editorial:
Capitalist roaders are very good at waving the red flag while opposing the red flag.
They are skilled at theft and deception.
Promoting their own revisionist ideas
This makes it difficult for the enemy to identify and makes them ubiquitous.
Therefore, the editorial emphasizes
Defeat the enemy organizationally
It's not a real victory yet.
We must thoroughly eradicate its pernicious influence from our ideology.
This is a crucial step.
Because when the enemy is defined as the bourgeoisie...
There is always another one
Identifiable objective standards
For example, do you own the means of production?
Whether to hire workers, etc.
However
When the bourgeoisie becomes an ideology or spirit
Then the number of enemies becomes infinite.
Even a poor peasant
It may also give rise to bourgeois ideology.
for example
You want to wear a pretty outfit today.
This is petit-bourgeois sentiment.
You're too tired from work and want to take a break.
It's just a lack of revolutionary fighting spirit.
You remain silent.
It could also be seen as resentful
Making a silent resistance
In this extreme environment
To prove that they are pure proletarians
Everyone must pass
Constantly reinforcing the experience of suffering and victimization
To prove their innocence and purity
For example, the more suffering you endure...
This means you were influenced by the old society.
The deeper the persecution by the reactionaries
The less likely you are to become one of them.
If you have nothing
Made huge sacrifices
You are the purest and most steadfast revolutionary.
In conclusion
The more one suffers, the more one endures.
The more people are in this system, the more moral capital they have.
The more they are able to attack those who are not suffering enough
Or individuals who are not pure enough
So, having said that...
What I want to emphasize is
This pursuit of purity without end
To draw moral capital
And the concept of the enemy
The tendency to expand indefinitely
It is widespread in Chinese society
Among various schools of thought
It can even be said
It transcends ideological opposition and disagreement.
Included in those more progressive ideas
The essence of this way of thinking
It's not about believing anything.
Rather, it's about how to believe.
Regardless of whether a person identifies with communism,
Feminism, liberal democracy
Or anti-NPD, etc.
Once he was captivated by this pursuit of purity
And the enemy's expansion indefinitely
Bound by the underlying psychology
So what was the original intention behind this idea?
Even if it is out of the pursuit of freedom and liberation
It still carries the risk of spoilage.
For example
In our article, "What to Do When Your Child is a Little Pink,"...
In that video
I once gave an example of a father
This father
I have a strong aversion to Chinese official political propaganda.
and history education
He hopes to enlighten and protect children.
However
Because his fear of this kind of brainwashing was too intense
He infinitely generalized and expanded the concept of evil.
for example
The child casually quoted a saying by Mao Zedong.
The father became very wary.
I'm worried that my son might have been poisoned by the Cultural Revolution.
Brainwashed by Chinese education
But actually, the child doesn't care at all.
I don't understand these political things
I just wanted to express my feelings.
However
This father has reached the point of making unfounded accusations.
Although he didn't have much power
But in the family setting
He was actually doing it in the name of enlightenment.
A new kind of discipline was imposed on the children.
This father may think
I am a powerless person
In resisting tyranny
But unconsciously
He played exactly that role.
The oppressor role he despised
He may have forgotten
Those ideologies he disliked
At its inception
Similarly, it is anti-authoritarian.
and the pursuit of equality and liberation
That's what attracted so many young people to join.
Speaking of which
I remembered a friend asking me a question a while ago.
Would Anthony think...
Many people are hard to awaken
I am very lonely
Do you ever feel a sense of anger at their lack of ambition?
I said I didn't feel that way.
Because I don't think
Party history
Understanding of China's political and economic system
It is to judge a person
The sole criterion for freedom and awakening
That
We will fall into a new trap of purity.
And it is easy to feel
Many people who do not meet this standard
They are uncivilized and ignorant.
I think
It is necessary to delve into a person's inner experience
To understand and in the system of meaning
For example, if a woman believes
Mao Zedong's famous saying, "Women hold up half the sky," is a testament to this.
She had
The courage to step out of the home and pursue happiness
Then I should support and appreciate the other person.
Instead of going to the other party
The political background of this statement in science popularization
Some people may think
The woman still has
Rethinking China's Ideology
It belongs to the category of those who are not awakened.
But what I'm concerned about is the inner world of the person involved.
The meaning given to this sentence
Those unique personal meanings and emotional colors
Rather than symbolic liberalism
Totalitarianism and the like
As long as the parties involved
They gained an experience of freedom and liberation from it.
Engaged in profound self-exploration
So even if his theory
It comes from a certain unhealthy ideology
It is still precious.
Many people tend
Concepts of morality, truth, and justice
Based solely on vigilance against evil,
Above identification, combat, and annihilation
Then he would easily fall into...
A cycle anchored by evil
Because he presupposes that all people are inherently sinful.
Or rather, it tends towards deterioration, corruption, and depravity.
Loss of purity
thus
As long as a person shows even the slightest impurity
Then his spirit was infiltrated by evil.
This kind of morality is certainly dangerous.
although
What he rebelled against might indeed be evil.
However
Because he needs the existence of evil
To define oneself
Once evil is eradicated
He will feel empty.
Then they have no choice but to seek out new evils to resist.
Ultimately, he himself became consumed by hatred and paranoia.
The witch hunt mentality is based on
Based on the dualism of good and evil
The world is simplified to
The eternal struggle between the two camps of good and evil
Evil is no longer an abstract concept
Rather, it is an independent entity or subject.
You can't understand it
The only options are to fight, eliminate, and negate it.
But the good in this concept of good and evil
It's not actually that sophisticated.
Because of this goodness
Not self-sufficient, free, or complete.
Its struggle against evil
The opposition and conflict remain entirely at the external level.
It even needs to rely on the fight against evil.
If evil disappears
It then loses its reason for existence.
Therefore, it must be continuous.
Seek out enemies, or even create them.
To maintain its existence
But the truly superior concept of truth or goodness
It should be self-sufficient and creative.
It is capable of resolving contradictions.
It does not depend on the existence of "evil".
To prove oneself
Rather, it is based on its intrinsic value and universality.
To understand the existence of evil
This is also what we mentioned in this 2024 video.
The mentioned
The idea that "evil is the lack of good"
In the monism of good and evil
Evil and good are not two equal realities.
The existence of evil
Not because there is a
An entity of evil independent of good
It is merely a lack of goodness.
For example
Violence and injustice
It is because of a lack of love and justice
Not because of an inevitable evil
Although the monism of good and evil also involves struggle,
Conflict and contradiction
However, in the final analysis
It is not based on exclusion and struggle.
Let's take an example.
If someone puts forward a viewpoint
To say that everyone is rational.
They are all pursuing the improvement of their own interests.
At this point, someone objected.
How do you explain some people?
Doing many irrational things that harm oneself
For example, self-harm, hunger strike, etc.
So this person might say
Because all the people who hurt me have problems.
It means they are fake or broken.
They are not real people.
This explanation can certainly be considered one type of explanation.
However, he presupposed an external opposition between good and bad.
External opposition between dross and essence
Instead of looking between things
A deeper connection
Because he found it too difficult.
So they hastily attached a label
It's as if I've finished explaining.
But actually nothing was explained.
A truly good explanation would be to adhere to monism.
For example, it is believed that
Even during hunger strikes and self-harm
These seemingly extreme self-harming behaviors
The parties involved are still pursuing a certain...
Hidden personal interests or benefits
He remains rational.
This explanation
It's not about justifying one's actions by referring to the other party's nationality.
It forces us to engage in interpersonal relationships
Finding commonalities and connections
To pursue a deep understanding of the other party
That's all for today's video.
