From
 the
 New
 [music]
 York
 Times,
 it's


the
 headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.


Today's
 Wednesday,
 December
 3rd.
 Here's


what
 we're
 covering.


It's
 nice
 to
 be
 with
 you.
 Welcome
 to
 the


final
 cabinet
 meeting
 of
 2025,
 a
 year


that
 will
 go
 down
 as
 the
 most


consequential
 and
 successful
 first
 year


of
 any
 administration.
 At
 the
 White


House
 yesterday,
 President
 Trump
 took


time
 at
 the
 top
 of
 his
 cabinet
 meeting


to
 push
 back
 on
 recent
 coverage
 about


his
 age
 and
 stamina.


>> Then
 I
 read
 in
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 "Is


Trump
 sharp?"
 Trump
 is
 sharp,
 but


they're
 not
 sharp.
 That's


>> There
 have
 been
 questions
 about
 how
 the


79year-old
 president,
 the
 oldest
 to
 ever


be
 elected,
 is
 juggling
 the
 demands
 of


the
 job
 after
 he
 appeared
 to
 doze
 off


during
 an
 event
 in
 the
 Oval
 Office
 last


month.
 An
 analysis
 from
 the
 Times
 found


that
 he's
 been
 keeping
 a
 shorter
 public


schedule
 and
 doing
 fewer
 public
 events


than
 he
 did
 at
 this
 point
 in
 his
 first


term.


>> You
 people
 are
 crazy.
 I'll
 let
 you
 know


when
 there's
 something
 wrong.
 There
 will


be
 someday


that's
 going
 to
 happen
 to
 all
 of
 us,
 but


right
 now


>> during
 the
 course
 of
 yesterday's
 2-hour


cabinet
 meeting
 as
 officials
 went
 around


the
 room
 and
 described
 their
 work,
 Trump


again
 appeared
 to
 be
 fighting
 sleep
 at


some
 moments,
 closing
 his
 eyes
 and


seeming
 to
 nod
 off.
 When
 asked
 after
 if


he'd
 fallen
 asleep,
 the
 White
 House


press
 secretary
 pushed
 back,
 saying
 he


was
 listening
 attentively
 and
 running


the
 entire
 meeting.


Meanwhile,


>> I
 don't
 want
 him
 in
 our
 country.
 I'll
 be


honest
 with
 you.
 Okay.
 Somebody
 would


say,
 "Oh,
 that's
 not
 politically


correct.
 I
 don't
 care.
 I
 don't
 want
 them


in
 our
 country.
 Their
 country
 is
 no
 good


for
 a
 reason."


>> As
 the
 meeting
 was
 wrapping
 up,
 Trump


unleashed
 a
 xenophobic
 tirade,
 railing


against
 immigrants
 from
 Somalia.
 He


called
 Somali's
 garbage,
 adding
 to
 his


long
 history
 of
 insulting
 black
 people,


particularly
 those
 from
 African


countries.


>> Let
 them
 go
 back
 to
 where
 they
 came
 from


and
 fix
 it.


>> Vice
 President
 J.
 D.
 Vance
 banged
 on
 the


table
 in
 encouragement,
 a
 kind
 of
 here


here.
 The
 president
 and
 his
 aids
 have


been
 targeting
 Somali
 in
 recent
 days


amid
 coverage
 of
 a
 fraud
 scandal
 that's


taken
 place
 in
 pockets
 of
 the
 Somali


community
 in
 Minnesota.


there.
 Almost
 60
 people
 have
 been


convicted
 for
 schemes
 that
 federal


prosecutors
 say
 diverted
 more
 than
 a


billion
 dollars
 intended
 for
 social


services
 like
 feeding
 kids
 during
 the


pandemic.
 Many
 Somali
 Americans
 say
 the


scandal
 has
 damaged
 their
 reputation
 and


is
 being
 used
 as
 a
 pretext
 to
 attack


their
 entire
 community.
 Trump's
 rant


came
 as
 the
 Times
 learned
 that
 the


administration
 is
 sending
 federal
 agents


from
 around
 the
 country
 to
 Minnesota
 to


launch
 an
 intensive
 immigration


enforcement
 operation.
 The
 focus
 will
 be


on
 detaining
 undocumented
 Somali


immigrants
 who
 have
 final
 deportation


orders,
 though
 one
 official
 said
 that


others
 could
 be
 swept
 up
 as
 well.
 At
 a


press
 conference
 yesterday,
 the
 mayor
 of


Minneapolis
 said
 he
 was
 alarmed
 by
 the


planned
 crackdown
 and
 worried
 that


quote,
 "American
 citizens
 will
 be


detained
 for
 no
 reason
 other
 than
 the


fact
 that
 they
 look
 Somali.


Now,
 two
 other
 quick
 political
 updates.


>> What
 a
 night.
 What
 a
 night."
 In


Tennessee,
 Matt
 Vaneps,
 the
 Republican


candidate
 for
 the
 US
 House,
 won
 a


special
 election
 that
 had
 drawn
 a
 flood


of
 national
 attention.


>> No
 matter
 what
 the
 DC
 insiders
 or


liberal
 media
 say,
 this
 is
 President


Trump's
 party,
 I'm
 proud
 to
 be
 a
 part
 of


it
 and
 can't
 wait
 to
 get
 to
 work.


The
 race
 had
 been
 seen
 as
 a
 test
 of
 how


Americans
 are
 feeling
 about
 the
 Trump


administration,
 and
 Republicans
 poured


millions
 of
 dollars
 into
 holding
 off
 a


surprisingly
 strong
 Democratic
 challenge


in
 the
 historically
 red
 district.
 Last


year,
 Trump
 won
 there
 by
 over
 20


percentage
 points.
 Vaneps
 won
 by
 roughly


nine.
 The
 relatively
 slim
 margin
 could


be
 a
 warning
 about
 the
 GOP's


vulnerabilities
 going
 forward.
 The


Democratic
 candidate
 galvanized
 voters


by
 focusing
 on
 affordability
 issues
 and


blaming
 Republicans
 for
 the
 rising
 cost


of
 healthcare.


Also,


>> Susan
 and
 I
 are
 super
 excited
 to


announce
 our
 $6.25
 billion
 gift
 to
 25


million
 American
 children.
 The
 tech


mogul
 Michael
 Dell,
 think
 Dell


computers,
 and
 his
 wife
 Susan
 said
 at


the
 White
 House
 yesterday
 that
 they're


making
 a
 multi-billion
 dollar
 donation


to
 expand
 the
 reach
 of
 the
 so-called


Trump
 accounts.
 The
 accounts,
 [music]


which
 the
 federal
 government
 is
 expected


to
 set
 up
 next
 summer,
 will
 give
 every


American
 baby
 born
 in
 the
 years
 2025


through
 2028
 $1,000
 that
 will
 be


invested
 [music]
 in
 the
 stock
 market.


The
 Dell's
 gift
 will
 expand
 the
 reach
 of


that
 program,
 giving
 $250
 to
 most
 kids


up
 to
 10
 years
 old.
 Many
 details
 are


still
 being
 hammered
 out,
 but
 the
 Dell


said
 that
 they
 hope
 their
 donation
 will


inspire
 other
 philanthropists,


corporations,
 and
 state
 and
 local


governments
 to
 also
 pump
 more
 money
 into


the
 [music]
 accounts


in
 Europe.
 Over
 the
 past
 few
 months,


there's
 been
 an
 increasing
 number
 of


small-scale
 attacks
 and
 acts
 of


sabotage.
 In
 Poland,
 authorities
 say


explosives
 were
 planted
 on
 a
 rail
 line.


In
 Denmark
 and
 Belgium,
 mysterious
 drone


sightings
 at
 airports
 have
 disrupted


flights.
 And
 in
 Sweden,
 navigation


systems
 for
 aircraft
 have
 been
 jammed.


Military
 officials
 and
 experts
 have
 long


pointed
 the
 finger
 at
 Russia,
 while


politicians
 largely
 avoided
 publicly


assigning
 blame.
 But
 now
 that's
 starting


to
 change.


>> Russia's
 hybrid
 actions
 in
 Europe
 are


increasingly
 brazen.
 Russia
 is


committing
 state
 sponsored
 terrorism.


Officials
 are
 calling
 out
 Russia
 more


forcefully
 and
 more
 often,
 leaning
 into


a
 name
 and
 shame
 strategy.
 They'd
 stop


short
 of
 that
 before,
 hoping
 to
 not


escalate
 tensions
 with
 Moscow.
 But
 since


the
 attacks
 have
 only
 continued,
 they're


changing
 their
 approach.
 European


leaders
 are
 also
 talking
 more
 openly


about
 how
 to
 defend
 themselves
 with


Poland
 activating
 10,000
 military


personnel
 to
 protect
 infrastructure.
 And


in
 Italy,
 the
 defense
 minister
 hopes
 to


open
 a
 new
 command
 center
 to
 protect


against
 the
 kind
 of
 attacks
 that
 have


been
 happening
 across
 the
 continent.
 The


wider
 public
 accusations
 about
 Russian


involvement
 may
 help
 get
 European


taxpayers
 on
 board
 with
 spending
 more
 on


similar
 defense
 projects.


In
 the
 last
 year,
 Bitcoin
 has
 been
 on
 a


wild
 ride.


>> I'm
 right
 here
 watching
 history
 be
 made.


>> Last
 December,
 the
 digital
 currency
 hit


a
 landmark
 value
 where
 one
 Bitcoin
 was


worth
 $100,000,


setting
 off
 huge
 celebrations
 in
 the


crypto
 world.
 And


>> this
 is
 the
 highest
 it's
 ever
 been.
 It's


ridiculous.
 By
 October,
 Bitcoin's
 value


had
 climbed
 even
 higher
 to
 $126,000.


But
 since
 then,


>> Bitcoin
 is
 in
 freef
 fall
 today.


>> Its
 value
 has
 plunged,
 erasing
 all
 of


the
 gains
 it
 made
 over
 the
 course
 of
 the


year.
 The
 downturn
 is
 notable
 because


under
 the
 Trump
 administration,
 which


has
 rolled
 back
 regulations
 on
 crypto,


currencies
 like
 Bitcoin
 have
 reached
 a


new
 level
 of
 mainstream
 acceptance
 with


more
 and
 more
 people
 buying
 them.
 But
 as


crypto
 has
 become
 less
 niche,
 its
 price


has
 started
 to
 be
 affected
 by
 broader


economic
 trends.
 The
 recent
 sell-off


came
 just
 after
 Trump
 threatened
 a
 major


new
 tariff
 on
 China
 that
 sent
 shock


waves
 through
 the
 global
 economy.
 Now,


with
 the
 price
 of
 crypto
 down,
 many
 of


the
 dozens
 of
 publicly
 traded
 companies


that
 bought
 into
 the
 crypto
 hype
 this


year
 have
 been
 struggling,
 announcing


share
 buybacks
 and
 management


reshuffles.
 The
 managing
 director
 of
 one


financial
 firm
 told
 the
 Times
 that
 the


crypto
 price
 roller
 coaster
 is
 a
 good


reminder
 that
 the
 investments
 [music]


aren't
 quote
 for
 the
 faint
 of
 heart.

And
 finally,
 it's
 almost
 the
 end
 of
 the


year,
 which
 means
 endofear
 lists.
 This


week,
 the
 editors
 of
 the
 Times
 Book


Review
 revealed
 their
 top
 10
 books
 of


2025.
 some
 fiction,
 some
 non-fiction.


There's
 some
 horror
 on
 the
 battlefield,


romance
 on
 a
 train,
 sister
 drama,


survival
 at
 sea.
 Of
 course,
 making
 any


list
 means
 leaving
 something
 off
 of
 it.


Dave
 Kim
 from
 the
 book's
 desk
 shared
 one


novel
 that
 he
 wishes
 made
 the
 cut.
 The


book
 is
 The
 Tokyo
 Suite
 by
 Giovana


Maloso.
 It's
 about
 two
 women,
 a
 hot
 shot


TV
 producer
 named
 Fernanda,
 and
 her
 maid


Maju.
 And
 Maju,
 the
 maid
 has
 kidnapped


Fernandez's
 daughter.
 And
 we
 don't
 know


why
 she's
 kidnapping
 her,
 but
 they're
 on


the
 run.
 And
 we
 get
 both
 of
 their


perspectives.
 We
 get
 their
 internal


lives,
 their
 histories,
 their


motivations,
 and
 it's
 just
 a
 fascinating


look
 at
 so
 many
 themes,
 motherhood,


class,
 just
 a
 great
 sensitive
 portrait,


but
 also
 very,
 very
 funny
 and
 and
 it


moves.
 It
 moves
 very
 quickly.
 I
 really


love
 that
 book.
