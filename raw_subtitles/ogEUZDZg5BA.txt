From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Natalie


Kitroof.
 This
 is
 the
 Daily.


In
 the
 wake
 of
 the
 monumental
 Supreme


Court
 ruling
 striking
 down
 President


Trump's
 tariffs,
 the
 entire
 world
 is


scrambling
 to
 understand
 what
 comes


next.
 Will
 countries
 back
 away
 from
 the


massive
 deals
 they
 made
 with
 Trump?
 Will


companies
 get
 refunds
 for
 the
 billions


they
 already
 spent
 on
 tariffs?
 And
 will


Trump
 actually
 be
 constrained
 by
 any
 of


this?
 Today,
 my
 colleagues
 Tyler
 Pager,


Anna
 Swanson,
 and
 Andrew
 Ross
 Sorcin


explain.


It's
 Monday,
 February
 23rd.


Tyler,
 you
 cover
 the
 White
 House.


Andrew,
 you
 cover
 corporate
 America.


Anna,
 you
 cover
 trade.
 Thank
 you
 all
 for


joining
 me
 on
 this
 Sunday
 afternoon.


>> Thanks
 so
 much,
 Natalie.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 us.


>> Yeah,
 glad
 to
 be
 here.
 So
 to
 catch
 us
 up


from
 where
 we
 left
 things
 on
 Friday
 with


the
 massive
 news
 that
 the
 Supreme
 Court


had
 invalidated
 most
 of
 the


administration's
 tariffs,
 we
 saw
 Trump


respond
 first
 by
 putting
 in
 place
 a
 new


10%
 tariff
 on
 imports
 across
 the
 board


and
 then
 jacking
 it
 up
 to
 15%
 over
 the


weekend.
 We're
 going
 to
 get
 into
 the


specifics
 of
 that
 today.
 But
 just
 to


start,
 what
 have
 the
 reactions
 been
 in


the
 worlds
 that
 you
 all
 cover?
 Tyler,
 I


want
 to
 start
 with
 you.
 take
 us
 inside


the
 reaction
 from
 the
 White
 House.


>> On
 Friday
 morning,
 the
 president
 was


speaking
 to
 a
 group
 of
 governors
 in
 the


East
 Room
 of
 the
 White
 House
 when


Jameson
 Greer,
 the
 trade
 representative,


handed
 him
 a
 note,
 alerting
 him
 to
 the


Supreme
 Court's
 decision.
 The
 president


told
 the
 governors
 it
 was
 a
 disgrace.
 He


lashed
 out
 at
 the
 Supreme
 Court


>> and
 quickly
 wrapped
 up
 that
 meeting
 and


left.
 And
 he
 was
 irate.
 He
 met
 with


adviserss.
 And
 then
 we
 saw
 that


full-blown
 anger
 on
 display
 in
 the
 White


House
 briefing
 room
 a
 few
 hours
 later.


And
 for
 Trump,
 this
 wasn't
 just
 a


political
 loss,
 but
 a
 personal
 one,
 too.


He
 has
 been
 obsessed
 with
 tariffs
 as
 an


economic
 tool
 for
 decades,
 long
 before


his
 political
 career.
 And
 so
 this
 felt


like
 a
 real
 personal
 loss
 to
 something


he
 deeply
 believes
 in.


>> And
 Anna,
 how
 has
 the
 international


community
 responded?


So
 obviously
 this
 had
 been
 somewhat


expected
 for
 other
 countries
 that
 were


following
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 ruling,
 but


it
 has
 still
 caused
 a
 lot
 of
 immediate


doubt
 and
 confusion
 with
 countries
 that


have
 been
 agonizing
 about
 these
 tariffs


all
 year.
 So
 you
 had
 countries
 that
 had


just
 finalized
 their
 trade
 deal
 the
 day


before.
 Now
 the
 underlying
 terms
 of


trade,
 the
 tariffs
 that
 those
 deals
 are


based
 on
 are
 gone
 and
 replaced
 with


something
 entirely
 different.
 And
 some


of
 those
 countries
 have
 made
 concessions


that
 are
 controversial
 with
 their
 own


people.
 So
 this
 has
 just
 introduced
 a


lot
 of
 uncertainty
 for
 the
 months
 to


come.


>> And
 Andrew,
 what
 about
 the
 corporate


world?


The
 Trump
 administration's
 tariff
 effort


is
 probably
 the
 most
 significant
 shift


in
 global
 trade
 in
 decades
 and
 really
 is


the
 most
 important
 sort
 of
 rethink
 about


how
 the
 United
 States
 trades
 with
 other


countries,
 how
 US
 corporations
 operate


in
 other
 countries,
 how
 international


companies
 operate
 in
 our
 countries.
 I


mean
 it
 is
 everything.
 I
 spent
 the


weekend
 talking
 to
 business
 leaders
 and


CEOs,
 many
 of
 whom
 really
 have


rescrambled
 their
 entire
 supply
 chains


over
 the
 last
 six
 months.
 Made


commitments
 to
 bring
 manufacturing
 back


to
 the
 United
 States,
 switched


manufacturing
 plants
 from
 places
 like


China
 to
 India
 to
 other
 places,


thought
 that
 they
 had
 remapped
 what


their
 true
 costs
 were
 going
 to
 be,
 and


are
 now
 looking
 at
 this
 saying,
 "Oh
 my


goodness,
 what
 comes
 next?"
 Hm.


>> I
 think
 all
 of
 these
 companies
 are


spending
 the
 weekend
 trying
 to
 think


through
 all
 of
 this
 with
 a
 sense
 though


that
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 very


long-term
 fight,
 whatever
 it
 is.


>> Okay.
 So,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 confusion


with
 companies
 and
 countries
 trying
 to


sort
 out
 what
 all
 this
 uncertainty
 means


for
 them.
 Tyler,
 the
 administration
 has


obviously
 been
 preparing
 for
 this
 moment


for
 a
 while.
 It's
 been
 clear
 that
 the


Supreme
 Court
 was
 skeptical
 of
 these


tariffs
 long
 before
 the
 actual
 ruling,


but
 the
 response
 from
 the
 White
 House


has
 still
 seemed
 pretty
 chaotic.
 First


the
 10%,
 then
 the
 15%.
 Do
 we
 have
 any


idea
 what's
 behind
 that
 sense
 of
 chaos?


>> Yeah,
 it
 was
 quite
 a
 whiplash
 over
 just


less
 than
 24
 hours
 where
 the
 president


came
 out
 to
 the
 briefing
 room
 and


announced
 these
 10%
 tariffs.
 Later
 that


evening,
 Friday,
 he
 signed
 the
 official


paperwork
 instituting
 those
 10%
 tariffs.


And
 then
 Saturday
 morning,
 he
 announces


this
 15%
 tariff
 on
 social
 media.
 And


what
 I
 will
 tell
 you,
 Natalie,
 is
 that


many
 of
 the
 president's
 adviserss
 and


people
 close
 to
 the
 White
 House
 were


surprised
 and
 taken
 aback
 by
 the
 rapid


change
 from
 10
 to
 15%.
 Some
 have


speculated
 that
 the
 president
 was


frustrated
 by
 the
 media
 coverage
 of
 his


loss
 at
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 and
 wanted
 to


show
 that
 he
 still
 had
 power
 to
 raise


tariffs
 even
 more.
 But
 we
 have
 not
 heard


from
 the
 president
 since
 then
 about


precisely
 why
 he
 made
 this
 change
 less


than
 24
 hours
 later.


>> I
 do
 think
 there's
 um
 an
 important
 point


there
 just
 to
 jump
 in.
 So,
 you
 know,


some
 people
 had
 speculated
 earlier
 that


maybe
 they
 would
 save
 that
 extra
 5%


increase
 and
 use
 it
 as
 leverage
 or


negotiation
 later,
 but
 at
 15%
 the
 rate


does
 get
 you
 close
 to
 what
 it
 was


overall
 before.
 So,
 at
 10%
 it
 was
 a


little
 bit
 lower
 than
 the
 the
 rate
 had


been
 previously.
 Now,
 it's
 like
 pretty


close.
 So,
 within
 an
 average
 percentage


point
 of
 what
 it
 was
 before.
 Of
 course,


this
 one
 is
 flat
 whereas
 the
 previous


rate
 varied
 a
 lot
 by
 country.
 So
 there


are
 huge
 differences
 for
 different


countries.


>> Right.
 Right.
 And
 just
 to
 jump
 off
 that,


I
 want
 to
 understand
 Anna
 what
 you've


been
 reporting
 on
 which
 is
 the
 options


that
 the
 administration
 is
 pursuing
 now


outside
 of
 just
 the
 15%
 tariff.
 Can
 you


ground
 us
 here?
 Give
 us
 a
 kind
 of
 sober


explanation
 of
 what
 the
 administration


has
 in
 store
 for
 us.


Yeah,
 absolutely.
 So,
 there
 was
 always
 a


plan
 B
 because
 before
 plan
 A,
 the


president
 was
 presented
 with
 this
 menu


of
 options
 for
 his
 tariffs
 and
 he
 had


chosen
 this
 International
 Emergency


Economics
 Powers
 Act
 because
 it
 was
 the


most
 flexible.
 It
 allowed
 him
 to
 raise


and
 lower
 tariffs
 at
 a
 whim.
 But
 he


always
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 options
 and
 in


fact
 um
 you
 know
 some
 of
 his
 adviserss


preferred
 those
 other
 options
 because


they
 were
 less
 vulnerable
 to
 a
 court


challenge.
 So
 now
 he's
 kind
 of
 going


back
 to
 th
 that
 original
 playbook,


right?
 And
 so
 there
 are
 a
 few
 different


authorities.
 One
 important
 one
 is
 called


section
 301.
 It's
 run
 by
 the
 office
 of


the
 United
 States
 trade
 representative.


They'll
 carry
 out
 investigations
 into


unfair
 trade
 practices
 and
 can
 levy


tariffs
 that
 way.
 It's
 what
 the


president
 used
 against
 China
 in
 his


first
 term.
 He
 also
 has
 another
 called


section
 232
 which
 allows
 for
 tariffs
 on


the
 basis
 of
 national
 security
 and
 there


are
 a
 lot
 of
 tariffs
 that
 have
 been


levied
 that
 way
 as
 well.
 So
 the


administration
 has
 put
 in
 place
 this
 15%


tariff
 for
 now.
 That's
 a
 flat
 rate
 for


the
 world.
 Those
 tariffs
 expire
 in
 5


months
 and
 if
 Trump
 wants
 to
 extend


them,
 he
 needs
 the
 approval
 of
 Congress,


which
 seems
 pretty
 unlikely
 at
 this


point
 given
 that
 midterms
 are
 coming
 up


and
 voters
 are
 concerned
 about


affordability
 and
 tariffs
 adding
 to


costs.
 And
 just
 to
 say
 the
 midterms
 and


the
 fact
 that
 the
 tariffs
 largely
 aren't


actually
 popular
 with
 voters,
 that's


actually
 part
 of
 the
 calculus
 for
 the


business
 community
 as
 they
 consider


their
 plans
 because
 they're
 looking
 at


all
 these
 tariffs
 and
 they're
 wondering


given
 the
 politics
 of
 this
 moment,
 are


these
 tariffs
 still
 going
 to
 be
 here
 in


6
 months?
 Because
 in
 truth,
 the
 view
 is


that
 if
 these
 tariffs
 are
 not
 going
 to


exist
 come
 this
 fall,
 the
 whole
 game


gets
 rescrambled.
 It
 changes
 completely


all
 over
 again.


And
 so
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 very
 interesting


to
 see
 whether
 companies
 tip
 their
 hand


and
 really
 tell
 us
 what
 they're
 going
 to


do,
 whether
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 willing


to
 really
 talk
 about
 what
 their
 plans


are
 next
 as
 they're
 making
 them.


>> And
 Andrew
 makes
 a
 great
 point
 because


this
 is
 of
 utmost
 importance
 to
 the


president
 himself.
 I
 was
 just
 with
 the


president
 in
 Georgia
 on
 Thursday
 where


he
 was
 touting
 these
 various
 business


executives
 who
 told
 him
 that
 they
 were


moving
 manufacturing
 or
 expanding


manufacturing
 in
 the
 United
 States


because
 of
 his
 tariffs.
 This
 is
 of


personal
 pride
 to
 the
 president.
 If


companies
 are
 changing
 their
 plans
 or


making
 new
 plans,
 they
 run
 the
 risk
 of


some
 sort
 of
 retribution
 campaign
 from


the
 president
 who
 feels
 extremely
 proud


of
 the
 impact
 he
 believes
 tariffs
 are


having
 in
 reshaping
 the
 American
 economy


and
 reviving
 the
 manufacturing
 sector.


Okay,
 Andrew,
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 what


the
 future
 may
 hold
 for
 these
 companies,


but
 I
 have
 to
 ask.
 It
 seems
 as
 though


the
 corporate
 world
 that
 you
 cover
 has


been
 really
 focused
 on
 the
 question
 of


what
 this
 decision
 means
 about
 the


tariffs
 they've
 already
 paid,
 about
 the


past,
 whether
 and
 how
 they
 might
 get


refunds
 on
 the
 billions
 in
 costs
 they've


already
 racked
 up.
 What
 do
 we
 know
 about


that?
 So
 look,
 you
 you
 can
 look
 at


companies
 like
 Toyota,
 which
 recently


attributed
 about
 $8
 billion
 of
 losses
 to


the
 tariffs.
 Ford
 said
 that
 the
 tariff


related
 charges
 cost
 them
 $2
 billion
 in


2025.
 They're
 expecting
 over
 a
 billion


dollars
 in
 2026.
 Uh
 General
 Motors
 uh
 is


in
 somewhat
 of
 a
 similar
 camp.
 So
 there


are
 a
 lot
 of
 businesses
 that
 have
 been


impacted
 uh
 by
 this
 that
 they
 can
 look


directly
 at
 those
 losses
 and
 say
 they


want
 that
 money
 back.
 There's
 a
 real


question
 about
 whether
 they
 can
 get
 that


money
 back,
 how
 the
 refund
 process


works,
 when
 you
 actually
 have
 to
 sue


effectively
 or
 put
 in
 for
 the
 refund,


you
 might
 need
 to
 do
 it
 relatively


quickly,
 which
 also
 means
 you
 have
 to
 do


it
 publicly.
 Mhm.


>> Again,
 this
 question
 of
 when
 you


publicly
 seek
 a
 refund,
 what
 does
 that


ultimately
 also
 mean
 for
 your
 business


if
 it's
 regulated
 in
 some
 other
 way
 by


the
 US
 government
 and
 if
 you're


concerned
 at
 all
 about
 the


administration
 somehow
 coming
 back
 at


you
 in
 another
 way,


>> retaliating?
 You're
 you're
 saying


basically
 there
 may
 be
 some
 risk
 for


these
 businesses
 in
 confronting
 the


president
 on
 this.
 You
 know,
 this


administration
 has
 aggressively
 pursued


companies
 in
 so
 many
 different
 ways,


whether
 it
 be
 law
 firms
 or
 you
 can
 look


at
 some
 of
 the
 big
 media
 companies
 or
 so


many
 other
 instances
 where
 they
 have


used
 their
 regulatory
 powers
 against


corporations
 that
 they
 did
 not
 believe


were
 quote
 unquote
 on
 side,
 if
 you
 will,


with
 this
 administration.
 And
 therefore,


I
 think
 there's
 a
 big
 question
 about,


you
 know,
 whether
 some
 of
 these


companies
 will
 seek
 refunds
 or
 not.


Anna,
 you
 regularly
 talk
 to
 small


businesses
 who
 have
 been
 affected
 by
 the


tariffs.
 I
 wonder
 whether
 they
 are
 at
 a


disadvantage
 in
 terms
 of
 getting
 refunds


given
 everything
 that's
 involved.
 What


are
 you
 hearing?


>> Yeah,
 absolutely.
 So,
 small
 businesses


tend
 to
 have
 fewer
 resources.
 They
 can't


hire
 the
 high
 price
 lawyers,
 the


lobbyists
 to
 come
 in
 and
 talk
 to
 the


Trump
 administration.
 And
 that
 has


really
 made
 a
 difference
 in
 how


different
 industries
 and
 companies
 have


been
 treated
 over
 the
 past
 year.
 And
 I


think,
 you
 know,
 one
 thing
 is
 that
 this


tariff
 system
 has
 just
 added
 this
 huge


amount
 of
 complexity
 for
 businesses
 to


deal
 with.
 And
 that
 takes
 resources.
 I


hear
 from
 companies
 all
 the
 time
 that


instead
 of
 doing,
 you
 know,
 their


business,
 they're
 spending
 time
 figuring


out
 these
 tariffs.
 And
 so
 that's
 a
 big


cost
 for
 companies.
 It's
 hard
 to


describe
 just
 how
 complicated
 the


Trump's
 tariff
 system
 was
 before
 the


Supreme
 Court
 ruling.
 There
 were


different
 rates
 for
 different
 countries,


different
 products.
 Now
 that
 is
 all


gone.
 It's
 replaced
 with
 an
 entirely


very
 different
 set
 system
 of
 tariffs.


There's
 a
 150day
 clock
 running
 on
 that


with
 big
 questions
 about
 what
 is
 going


to
 replace
 it.


>> And
 all
 that
 uncertainty
 is
 just
 it's


bad
 for
 investment.
 I
 mean,
 companies


are
 not
 going
 to
 want
 to
 invest
 billions


of
 dollars
 in
 a
 factory
 that
 will
 take


years
 to
 build
 if
 tariff
 policy
 is
 going


to
 change
 dramatically
 in
 the
 next
 few


months.


>> Okay,
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 to
 those
 bigger


implications.
 Andrew,
 I
 have
 what
 may


seem
 like
 a
 technical
 question
 for
 you.


We
 talked
 on
 the
 show
 before
 about
 the


question
 surrounding
 who
 was
 actually


paying
 for
 the
 tariffs.
 Were
 the


companies
 eating
 the
 cost
 or
 were
 they


passing
 it
 on
 to
 consumers?
 If
 the


companies
 raised
 prices
 because
 of


tariffs,
 can
 they
 actually
 legitimately


get
 refunds?


>> You
 are
 asking
 what
 may
 be
 the
 $175


billion
 question,
 which
 is
 to
 say
 there


is
 an
 argument
 that
 may
 be
 made
 by
 this


administration
 in
 court
 if
 a
 company


comes
 to
 seek
 a
 refund.


It
 is
 possible
 that
 the
 administration


will
 argue
 that
 they
 effectively
 raised


prices,
 didn't
 suffer
 or
 subject


themselves
 therefore
 to
 a
 loss,
 and


therefore
 effectively
 have
 no
 standing


to
 collect
 a
 refund.


>> And
 Tyler,
 how
 is
 the
 administration


thinking
 about
 this
 question
 of


companies
 potentially
 demanding
 massive


refunds?


>> Natalie,
 they're
 not
 really
 seeming
 to


think
 about
 it
 all
 that
 much
 at
 all.
 We


saw
 Treasury
 Secretary
 Scott
 Pess
 say
 he


didn't
 think
 that
 the
 American
 people


would
 see
 this
 money
 and
 the
 president


at
 his
 news
 conference
 on
 Friday


basically
 ignored
 questions
 about


refunds.
 And
 so
 even
 as
 reporters


repeatedly
 tried
 to
 press
 him,
 he
 has


very
 much
 quickly
 moved
 on
 and
 has


started
 talking
 about
 new
 tariffs
 that


he
 wants
 to
 institute.
 and
 there
 doesn't


seem
 to
 be
 a
 whole
 lot
 of
 consideration


about
 what
 this
 process
 may
 look
 like


should
 companies
 start
 requesting
 them.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 it's
 pretty
 clear
 that


they're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 very


enthusiastic
 about
 paying
 that
 money


back.
 The
 question
 is
 how,
 you
 know,


cooperative
 they
 are
 with
 any
 eventual


court
 order.
 um
 it
 will
 really
 be
 up
 to


the
 administration
 to
 set
 up
 this
 system


for
 refunds
 and
 that
 could
 be
 you
 know


it
 could
 be
 an
 easy
 process
 if
 they


wanted
 to
 make
 it
 that
 way
 or
 it
 could


be
 kind
 of
 a
 nightmare
 for
 companies.


You
 know
 honestly
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 be


surprised
 if
 it's
 months
 or
 even
 years


by
 the
 time
 this
 process
 plays
 out
 in


court
 by
 the
 time
 this
 system
 is
 set
 up


and
 companies
 actually
 get
 that
 money
 in


their
 hands.
 Can
 I
 say
 part
 of
 the


political
 decision
 by
 this


administration
 to
 pursue
 tariffs
 the
 way


he
 did
 was
 because


of
 the
 expectation
 that
 even
 if
 they


were
 overturned,
 it
 would
 be
 very


difficult
 to
 get
 the
 refunds
 back.


>> H
 you're
 saying
 it
 was
 part
 of
 the


design?


>> All
 of
 this
 was
 part
 of
 the
 design


because
 by
 default
 it
 forced
 these


companies
 and
 these
 countries
 into
 this


particular
 situation.
 some
 of
 whom
 have


made
 commitments,
 not
 just
 commitments,


but
 have
 made
 investments
 that
 are
 very


hard
 to
 turn
 back
 on
 now.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 essentially,
 you
 could
 see


these
 tariffs
 as
 a
 year
 of
 a
 kind
 of


corporate
 tax.
 Is
 that
 fair?


>> Some
 people
 would
 call
 them
 a
 corporate


tax.
 Some
 people
 would
 call
 them
 a
 tax


on
 consumers.
 The
 administration
 would


call
 them
 a
 tax
 on
 other
 countries.


>> After
 the
 break,
 we
 look
 at
 those
 other


countries
 and
 the
 global
 fallout
 from


the
 tariff
 ruling.
 We'll
 be
 right
 back.


So
 Anna,
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 all
 the


agreements
 that
 Trump
 has
 reached,
 all


the
 deals
 he's
 reached
 with
 other


countries,
 trade
 deals
 that
 everyone


from
 Europe
 to
 Japan
 has
 made
 based
 on


what
 have
 now
 been
 deemed
 illegal


tariffs.
 Are
 those
 deals
 now
 moot?


Well,
 it's
 still
 kind
 of
 up
 in
 the
 air.


So,
 countries
 have
 agreed
 to
 major


concessions
 over
 the
 last
 few
 months.


The
 administration
 has
 made
 initial


trade
 deals
 that
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 cases
 are


kind
 of
 vague,
 but
 you
 know,
 still
 deals


with
 dozens
 of
 countries
 in
 which


they've
 agreed
 to
 drop
 tariffs,
 make
 big


investments
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 And


now
 the
 tariffs
 that
 underly
 those
 are


suddenly
 gone.
 But
 you
 already
 see
 some


hesitation
 on
 the
 part
 of
 other


countries,
 you
 know,
 that
 have
 agreed
 to


these
 terms.
 So
 you
 had
 officials
 in
 the


EU
 saying
 recently
 that
 they
 might
 pause


the
 ratification
 of
 their
 trade
 deal.


And
 the
 other
 piece
 of
 this
 is
 that
 this


new
 system,
 this
 flat
 15%
 tariff
 for


everybody
 for
 some
 countries
 feels


really,
 really
 unfair
 because
 they
 have


made
 a
 lot
 of
 concessions
 to
 the
 United


States
 in
 order
 to
 lower
 their
 tariff


rates.
 Now
 they're
 right
 back
 where


everybody
 else
 is.
 So
 countries
 like


Britain
 and
 Australia
 were
 at
 10%.
 Now


they're
 at
 15%
 along
 with
 other


countries
 like
 Vietnam,
 Indonesia,


India.
 So
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 in
 other


countries
 just
 questioning
 whether
 they


should
 have
 made
 all
 these
 concessions


to
 the
 president
 for
 tariffs
 that
 are


not
 now
 in
 effect.
 But
 Anna,
 do
 these


countries
 not
 have
 the
 same
 risks
 that


we
 talked
 about
 companies
 having
 in


terms
 of,
 you
 know,
 poking
 the
 bear,


potentially
 confronting
 Trump?
 Couldn't


that
 be
 dangerous
 for
 them
 if
 he


responds,
 if
 he
 retaliates?


>> Yeah,
 absolutely.
 I
 think
 they
 do
 have
 a


lot
 of
 risk
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 poking
 the


bear.
 The
 president
 has
 been
 restrained


by
 this
 Supreme
 Court
 ruling.
 He's
 not


able
 to
 use
 that
 emergency
 power,
 but
 he


has
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 tariff
 authorities


and
 he
 can
 still,
 you
 know,
 levy
 just


incredible
 taxes
 on
 their
 imports.
 So,
 a


lot
 of
 countries
 are
 not
 backing
 away


from
 their
 deals
 right
 away.
 They're


very
 cognizant
 that
 the
 president
 has


these
 other
 tariff
 powers
 that
 he
 could


just
 whack
 them
 with
 if
 they
 do
 decide


to
 break
 their
 agreement.
 The


administration
 has
 also
 warned
 other


countries
 that
 they
 will
 in
 fact
 do


that.
 you
 know,
 sometimes
 it
 may
 take


writing
 a
 report
 or
 it
 may
 take,
 you


know,
 a
 few
 weeks
 or
 months,
 but
 he
 can


still,
 you
 know,
 levy
 just
 incredible


taxes
 on
 their
 imports.
 That
 makes
 a


huge
 difference
 to
 industries
 in
 other


countries
 that
 are
 trying
 to
 sell


products
 to
 the
 United
 States.
 You
 know,


the
 other
 piece
 of
 this
 is
 the
 biggest


country
 that
 didn't
 make
 a
 trade
 deal


with
 the
 United
 States,
 which
 is
 China.


You
 know,
 Trump
 had
 threatened
 something


like
 125%
 tariffs
 on
 China.
 He
 had
 put


very
 high
 tariffs
 on
 China
 before
 they


were
 ruled
 illegal.
 And
 now
 China
 has


this
 much
 lower
 rate.
 So
 I
 wonder
 where


that
 leaves
 us.


>> I
 think
 this
 goes
 back
 to
 the
 the
 bigger


issue
 about
 countries
 and
 companies


playing
 chicken
 with
 the
 administration.


And
 you
 could
 argue
 that
 China
 has


played
 the
 best
 game
 of
 chicken
 yet


because
 they
 didn't
 accept
 some
 kind
 of


higher
 rate
 earlier
 and
 they
 did
 try
 to


slow
 roll
 and
 play
 out
 these


negotiations
 as
 long
 as
 possible.
 And


you
 heard
 early
 on
 that
 some
 countries


had
 thought
 about
 approaching
 it
 that


way.
 But
 there
 became
 this
 sort
 of
 view


especially
 as
 a
 couple
 of
 countries


early
 on
 accepted
 these
 deals
 that
 this


was
 the
 future
 that
 irrespective
 of
 what


the
 Supreme
 Court
 said
 that
 tariffs
 in


one
 way
 or
 another
 are
 here
 to
 stay
 for


some
 period
 of
 time
 that
 was
 going
 to


sort
 of
 rewrite
 the
 global
 trade
 order.


>> And
 Natalie,
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 get


a
 lot
 more
 on
 this
 front
 because
 the


president
 is
 expected
 to
 travel
 to


Beijing.


>> Yep.
 at
 the
 end
 of
 March,
 early
 April


and
 meet
 with
 Xi
 Jinping.
 So,
 we
 should


expect
 there
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 more


conversation
 about
 what
 the
 USChina


relationship
 looks
 like,
 particularly
 as


it
 pertains
 to
 trade
 in
 the
 weeks
 ahead.


>> So,
 okay,
 just
 thinking
 about
 where
 all


this
 leaves
 Trump
 on
 the
 global
 stage


moving
 forward,
 obviously
 the
 president


now
 has
 just
 lost
 this
 major
 source
 of


power
 that
 he's
 been
 relying
 on.
 What


the
 broad
 tariff
 authority
 had
 given
 him


was
 leverage
 in
 dealmaking,
 not
 just
 on


trade
 deals,
 right,
 but
 also
 in
 his


foreign
 policy
 generally.
 He's
 been


achieving
 what
 he
 wants
 around
 the
 world


in
 part
 by
 using
 tariffs
 as
 a
 cudgel
 to


force
 countries
 to
 the
 table
 to
 force


him
 to
 give
 him
 things
 they
 want.
 Now
 he


doesn't
 have
 that.
 What
 impact
 does
 that


loss
 of
 leverage
 have?
 Tyler,
 let's


start
 with
 you.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 enormous.
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 the


centerpiece,
 arguably
 of
 his
 foreign


policy.
 He
 used
 it
 often
 for
 economic


reasons,
 but
 he
 also
 tried
 to
 use
 it
 to


cut
 peace
 deals.
 We
 know
 that
 the


president
 is
 very
 determined
 to
 win
 the


Nobel
 Peace
 Prize.
 He
 repeatedly
 brags


about
 how
 many
 conflicts
 he
 solved


overseas.
 And
 at
 the
 core
 of
 some
 of


those
 strategies
 was
 threatening
 tariffs


on
 countries
 if
 they
 didn't,
 in
 his


words,
 lay
 down
 their
 arms
 and
 stop


fighting.
 And
 so
 it
 dramatically
 changes


his
 negotiating
 position
 on
 the
 world


stage
 because
 he's
 unable
 to,
 as
 Anna


very
 clearly
 laid
 out,
 apply
 different


tariff
 rates
 to
 different
 countries
 at
 a


whim.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 left
 a
 lot
 of


foreign
 leaders
 uncertain
 about
 what


move
 they
 made
 and
 whether
 or
 not
 they


could
 be
 punished
 by
 the
 president
 for


whatever
 they
 might
 do.
 that
 uncertainty


has
 been
 diminished
 in
 some
 ways
 because


the
 president
 can't
 just
 unilaterally


apply
 different
 tariffs
 to
 different


countries
 on
 any
 given
 day.


>> Right?
 I
 mean,
 one
 one
 source
 said
 to
 me


that
 this
 takes
 away
 Trump's
 lightning


bolt
 powers.
 So,
 his
 Zeuslike
 ability
 to


just,
 you
 know,


>> strike
 other
 countries
 with
 tariffs.
 It


doesn't
 take
 away
 the
 ability
 to
 do


tariffs
 at
 all.
 It
 just
 requires
 some


planning.
 So
 I
 think
 you
 will
 continue


to
 see
 the
 president
 use
 the
 threat
 of


tariffs.
 It's
 just
 you
 won't
 see
 the


rate
 change
 tomorrow.


>> I
 think
 it's
 also
 worth
 pointing
 out


that
 the
 president
 in
 implementing
 these


new
 tariffs
 at
 15%
 across
 the
 board
 is


using
 something
 called
 section
 122.
 And


it
 is
 very
 possible
 that
 the
 way
 he's


approaching
 it
 even
 this
 time
 is
 going


to
 be
 brought
 to
 court
 all
 over
 again.


Neil
 Katiel,
 who
 was
 the
 lawyer
 who


brought
 the
 original
 case
 and
 went
 to


the
 Supreme
 Court
 and
 argued
 it
 there


successfully
 now,
 has
 made
 this
 point


over
 the
 weekend
 that
 there's
 an


argument
 potentially
 that
 the
 president


cannot
 use
 section
 122
 in
 the
 way
 that


he
 is
 attempting
 to.
 And
 so
 we
 could
 be


back
 here
 6
 months
 from
 now
 again
 in


front
 of
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 over
 this


too.


>> That's
 interesting.
 You're
 saying


basically
 that
 the
 authorities
 that
 the


president
 is
 now
 using
 as
 an
 alternative


may
 themselves
 be
 challenged.
 I
 just


want
 to
 push
 though
 on
 something
 which


is
 that
 we're
 talking
 about
 the


president
 having
 a
 weaker
 hand
 in


negotiations
 being
 more
 constrained
 and


legally
 that
 is
 functionally
 true.


Right?
 he
 can
 no
 longer
 just
 wake
 up
 one


day
 and
 slap
 50%
 tariffs
 on
 major


trading
 partners.
 But
 I
 still
 think


though
 that
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people,
 it's


just
 hard
 to
 believe
 that
 that's


actually
 going
 to
 happen
 when
 you
 see


Trump
 getting
 up
 there
 at
 his
 presser
 on


Friday
 and
 essentially
 saying
 that's
 not


going
 to
 work.
 I
 am
 going
 to
 find
 ways


to
 put
 tariffs
 in
 place
 and
 they're


going
 to
 be
 even
 more
 severe.
 This
 is


new
 for
 President
 Trump.
 Congress


controlled
 by
 Republicans
 has
 largely


gone
 along
 with
 everything
 he's
 wanted


to
 do
 and
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 had
 not


limited
 his
 power
 in
 any
 major
 way


before
 this
 decision.
 And
 so
 for
 the


president,
 it's
 a
 moment
 where
 he
 has
 to


reckon
 with
 the
 checks
 and
 balance


inherent
 in
 the
 Constitution
 that
 for


most
 of
 his
 first
 year
 in
 office,
 he
 has


not
 really
 felt
 constrained
 by.
 You're


saying
 this
 is
 something
 we
 haven't


really
 seen
 in
 any
 major
 way
 until
 this


ruling
 and
 we
 don't
 actually
 know
 how


Trump
 is
 going
 to
 respond.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 we
 know
 that
 Trump
 is


immediately
 responding
 by
 trying
 to
 put


on
 these
 tariffs
 and
 just
 disregarding


Congress,
 which
 if
 he
 really
 wanted
 to


pursue
 these
 tariffs
 that
 he
 initially


put
 on,
 he
 could
 go
 down
 the
 path
 of


using
 the
 legislative
 branch.


But
 right
 now,
 Trump
 is
 not
 interested


in
 that.
 He
 likes
 to
 do
 things


unilaterally
 and
 he
 likes
 to
 do
 things


quickly.
 And
 so
 this
 is
 a
 significant


moment
 in
 which
 Trump
 has
 to
 readjust
 to


a
 real
 constraint
 on
 his
 power.
 Okay,
 I


want
 to
 just
 pull
 back
 for
 a
 minute.
 One


thing
 that
 does
 seem
 clear
 is
 that
 we


are
 now
 living
 in
 a
 world
 with
 tariffs.


Whether
 we're
 talking
 about
 15%
 tariffs


or
 higher,
 the
 US
 seems
 to
 have


permanently
 at
 this
 point
 moved
 away


from
 truly
 and
 absolutely
 abiding
 by


free
 trade
 principles
 and
 moved
 toward
 a


definitively
 more
 protectionist
 and


nationalist
 economy
 by
 default.
 How


should
 we
 think
 about
 that?
 You
 know


over
 the
 next
 decade
 irrespective
 of


what's
 just
 happened
 here
 there
 is
 going


to
 be
 an
 element
 of
 tariffs
 that
 are


going
 to
 be
 part
 of
 our
 lives
 and
 are


going
 to
 be
 part
 of
 all
 of
 these


countries
 and
 companies
 lives
 and
 as
 a


result
 it
 really
 has
 shifted
 potentially


permanently
 or
 at least


semi-permanmanently


the
 relationship
 the
 United
 States
 has


with
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world.


Well,
 Tyler,
 Anna,
 Andrew,
 thanks
 for


coming
 on
 the
 show.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Thanks
 so
 much,
 Natalie.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 us.


>> We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know.


Today,
 an
 armed
 man
 was
 shot
 and
 killed


by
 law
 enforcement
 officers
 after
 he


entered
 the
 secure
 perimeter
 of
 Mara


Lago
 early
 Sunday
 morning.
 The
 local


sheriff
 identified
 the
 man
 as
 Austin


Tucker
 Martin,
 a
 21-year-old
 from
 North


Carolina.


Authorities
 say
 Martin
 was
 carrying
 what


appeared
 to
 be
 a
 shotgun
 and
 a
 fuel


canister
 and
 that
 when
 he
 was
 ordered
 to


drop
 the
 items,
 he
 put
 down
 the
 canister


but
 raised
 the
 shotgun
 to
 a
 shooting


position,
 prompting
 officers
 to
 open


fire.


President
 Trump
 wasn't
 at
 the
 resort
 at


the
 time.
 He
 had
 hosted
 state
 governors


at
 the
 White
 House
 the
 night
 before.


And
 heavy
 snow
 pounded
 through
 the


Northeast
 and
 Mid-Atlantic
 on
 Sunday
 as


a
 major
 winter
 storm
 forced
 widespread


transit
 shutdowns
 and
 thousands
 of


flight
 cancellations.


Over
 35
 million
 people
 from
 eastern


Maryland
 to
 eastern
 Massachusetts
 were


under
 blizzard
 warnings.


More
 than
 2
 ft
 of
 snow
 is
 expected
 in


parts
 of
 New
 England.
 If
 New
 York
 City


snowfall
 hits
 18
 in
 as
 forecast,
 it


would
 be
 the
 heaviest
 in
 a
 decade.


The
 city
 banned
 non-essential
 travel


until
 noon
 on
 Monday,
 and
 officials
 in


New
 Jersey
 imposed
 a
 travel
 ban
 for
 most


drivers
 that's
 expected
 to
 lift
 around


7:00
 a.m.
 on
 Monday.
 As
 of
 Sunday
 night,


most
 flights
 in
 and
 out
 of
 Kennedy


Airport,
 LaGuardia
 Airport,
 and
 Newark


Airport
 had
 been
 cancelled.
 Governors
 in


New
 York,
 New
 Jersey,
 Connecticut,


Massachusetts,
 Maryland,
 Rhode
 Island,


Pennsylvania,
 and
 Delaware
 declared


states
 of
 emergency.
