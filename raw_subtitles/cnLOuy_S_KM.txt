So for
what it's worth, I spend a lot of my time
contemplating the word
ecosystem, mostly raging against it
because it is one of the less documented
wealth transfers.
And by the way, the credit card industry
in general is a regressive wealth transfer
where people who never
evolve transactions, like probably
both of you and me,
when I use credit cards,
which is really rare
these days, we're paying our bills.
At the end of the month,
we're not paying a penny of interest.
I think Joe on the record
saying you've never paid any interest.
And so I think that's a
that's a nice place to be
if you can afford it, telling people
that they should just not borrow
and pay it off at the end of the month
is an incredibly let them eat cake
equivalent for the 21st century, payments.
Lots of people in America revolve.
Half the country revolves in a $10,000.
And so the idea of those people caring
about rewards is sort of preposterous.
They do not. They care about
making their minimum payment.
Hello and
welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots
podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal and I'm Tracy Alloway.
Tracy,
it feels like, everybody, whether,
they want to come after the banks
right there is this effort.
So many of our episodes,
whether we're talking about crypto,
whether we're talking
about private credit,
whether we're talking about payment, it's
this goal, this dream of like, let's
chip away at some of these bank businesses
or these businesses that were associated
with some sort of legacy institutions.
The banks, they mostly seem to be doing
pretty well still.
But there's this dream
that they can all be sort
of like disintermediated away,
or that someone could.
Each one of these functions that they do
can be better done somewhere else.
Yeah.
So let's see,
I have been in financial journalism
for almost 20 years now,
which is kind of crazy.
It makes me feel very old,
but for as long as I can remember,
someone has been trying to either
reinvent bank
lending or reinvent the payments space.
And I guess I can see a few reasons.
So like, genuinely, some payment
architecture is really old fashioned.
Yeah.
Especially in the US where, you know,
sometimes you still have to write a check
for something. Yeah, blows my mind.
And the U.S.
didn't get chips for a really long time.
Chips and credit cards
and stuff like that.
But also, if you think about the payment
and lending and financial market
just in general, it's
one of the biggest out there, right?
Like you're talking
about all the economic activity basically.
And so if you can get a tiny slice
of that total interchange or fees,
then you can see how people, you know,
people are really interested
in that space, know completely.
And we know that there are a lot of
like fintech companies for a long time.
I mean, some of the most, you know,
the earliest internet success stories,
period, were,
you know, this is definitely nothing new.
And of course, one of the first ever
was PayPal, which recognized that with
the internet was going to come, all kinds
of new opportunities for payments
and sort of quasi peer to peer literal,
peer to peer, transactions, etc..
PayPal is still, of course,
extremely important part of the payments,
infrastructure, etc..
But yeah, there's so much going on.
But to your point,
lots of companies have gotten
those little slices
and made an incredible fortune.
Yeah.
We also did an episode on Buy
now, pay later, a couple months ago.
And there are clearly some
interesting questions
brought up by the expansion of that space.
And you and I talked about how
wherever you go on the internet
nowadays, you get like, you know, probably
at least 2 or 3 little buttons that offer
you installment loans on your purchases.
And obviously, the concern is
whether or not people are taking out
credit that they shouldn't necessarily be.
There's a big discussion about that.
And also the transparency of the credit
that they're taking out.
Right.
This is we have,
you know, and we'll get into this there,
there are pros and cons,
I guess, relative to credit cards.
But one thing with credit cards
is that there is decades
and decades of data on them,
and we know how they're used,
and there's really good
risk profiling and scores and all this
and credit scoring and all this stuff.
Bnpl is sort of more novel.
And so therefore, to
what degree do we know how is as an asset
or as a function
it performs across different, cycles?
Do we know the cohort
cohort of people who use Bnpl as
well as we know the people,
the types of people who use credit cards?
It seems a little bit, at a minimum, a bit
more ambiguous.
Absolutely.
Well, we've sort of hinted at
what we're going to be talk about.
I mentioned PayPal, we talked about Bnpl,
we are going to be speaking
with one of the original members
of the PayPal Mafia.
We're going to be speaking with Max
Levchin.
He's the founder and CEO of Affirm,
one of the
biggest Bnpl companies
publicly traded. Max.
Thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots
Thank you for having me.
I'm a big fan of the show.
Thank you.
It's a bit of a privilege to be here.
Thank you
for saying that on the recording.
So we always love hearing it,
but we love when it's on the public record
as part of the episode.
So, thank you so much.
Where did you get the idea
to start a firm?
Why did you what what what prompted it?
But a two sided coin.
Both sides bad of personal experience,
actually
tying neatly to the PayPal story.
So I came to the US at 16
from Soviet Union.
And so you can imagine I understood
very little about borrowing and credit
and things like that.
And so I got my first credit card
on campus
at college at 18.
Didn't fully understand
what I was signing up for, certainly
didn't read the fine print where it said
0% asterisk, don't worry about it.
Borrowed a bunch of money,
financed my first startup
from that very same credit card.
Promptly got into more
that I could afford to pay for.
Startup failed,
eventually got some nasty calls
from collectors,
paid it off, and four years later,
or five years later,
took this little company.
PayPal public was basically independently
wealthy overnight.
Went to buy a fancy car that you know, as
I originally deserved.
At the ripe age of 23,
I wanted to show off to my
my then girlfriend, now wife,
and was the client for credit.
And not only did I feel completely screwed
by the moment when I found out that you're
supposed to make the minimum payment.
And by the way, interest accrues
into principle,
and this seemingly low
Apr is actually not what it seems to be.
Because I missed some date of the specific
amount that I was supposed to pay, it
sort of bit me again
five years later was like, oh, by the way,
wreck your credit rating too,
so you can't get a loan for anything,
even as you sort of proudly sticking
a finger at the article and newspaper
saying, you know, the company,
public, youngest, whatever, whatever.
And so that was the thing
that stayed with me for years.
My friends would prank me at restaurants.
They would ask the waitstaff to tell me
that my credit card was declined, which by
then was a different credit
card, and I would turn beet purple
and basically be like,
oh my God, like it happened again.
Like what?
And you know, eventually
I knew it was a joke,
but I was in my mid 30s
when I realized that that's now
more likely a joke than that
credit score bite from 18.
And so in my late 30s,
I sat down with a friend from high school,
college and people, you know,
I've many of these friends who'd sort of
I met when I was just getting my feet
wet in America.
And ultimately we, you know,
we built this amazing company together
and asked them the sort of the obvious
question, 20 years too late,
why didn't we try to fix the yuck
that comes with having credit cards?
As a young person?
And he said, you know,
I don't know, but we built so much great.
I at PayPal fighting fraud and doing
all these really stunning things.
Surely we could do a better job
scoring credit
for young people like you were at 18
and then 23.
Then what currently happens?
That was sort of the seminal moment.
And, you know, a couple of years later
we started a firm.
So I have a bunch of questions already.
Firstly, what kind of car was it?
Did you get it in? And,
I had to pay cash for it.
I actually wired money, and 
it would begin like an 8 a.m.
visit to a dealership. Ended up like,
it's 5 p.m..
Your wired hasn't cleared up.
You can't drive off this lot.
And it did.
You know, drama, at the time.
Don't judge me.
It was a black hardtop
Mercedes convertible.
Oh, and no judgment at all.
I'm judging a little bit.
I was really young.
I was very much trying to impress the girl
who's now my wife and the mother.
Well, it clearly works. It works,
it works, it works.
Okay, Another question.
So I just want to.
I love those old those Mercedes.
I think that there's one of the if I, if
I have some rough conception, no judgment.
I think those those are great design
cars. Anyway.
Should we just talk about
cars? Yeah, we could. Okay.
Well,
you mentioned the underwriting process,
and this, in my mind, is supposed to be
what makes the buy now, pay later.
Bnpl model different, right?
Like the underwriting process
is more technologically driven,
perhaps more nuanced.
Talk to us
about what you do differently versus,
you know, a credit card company or a bank
or someone like that.
Sure. And you're
you're pulling on a thread that's
going to take a long time to unwind.
I'll try to be pithy, but, 
this is where the the rage kicks in.
So one of the things that happens
with credit cards at the very core,
they tell you a bunch of things
they don't actually want you to do.
So a credit card business model
is accrual of interest into principle.
So this exponential function
of your signing up for Apr x,
but you don't actually know
what's going to cost you, is all the fact
that as you make the minimum payments
or whatever the payments you're making,
whatever you haven't paid off,
the interest that you've accrued folds
right into the principal and it compounds
and compounds and compounds.
And so the longer you take to pay it back,
the more it will cost,
which seems obvious, but it's impossible
for most mere mortals to predict.
And they love it when you're late, because
there are late fees which are fixed.
And so the less you spend, the higher
the percentage the late fee represents.
So it's the sort of amazing
business model, which is why, you know,
one of your recent episodes puzzled over
how are these rates so high.
The rates
themselves are actually not the problem.
The problem is the structure.
As you fold interest into principle
and pay and pay and pay late fees,
it can be extraordinarily expensive.
And so from the very beginning of a firm,
we asked the question,
how can we make a product where
you don't have this weird
misalignment of interests,
where the lender tells you,
please pay your bills on time?
But what they're saying sort of is,
but not to on time and ideally
take as long as possible because that's
when we make the most money.
So the obvious answer is,
of course, obvious.
Make a plan that you commit as a lender
that you'll never change
and don't charge late fees.
And that's it.
If you agree to those design principles,
you are not going to make more money.
If someone is late
and you're not going to make more money
if they take longer to pay you back,
obviously you'll make less money because
getting money to lend isn't free either.
We have to pay for our sources of capital.
As you know, as everybody else does,
which means that it immediately rotates
you sort of 180 degrees
where you say, I only want to lend money
when I have a lot of conviction.
The person is going to pay me back
on time, because if they don't,
I am just going to lose money.
And so we put those two principles
down in the ground very, very early on.
It's literally written
down to the foundation of the company.
We will not misalign ourselves
with our borrowers.
From that came a lot of things like, hey,
we need to understand your cash flow.
We don't really care what your credit
rating is.
Maybe you gamed it,
maybe it's not accurate.
Maybe your 18 year old immigrant
does not matter.
We need to understand
what your actual capability is.
We have to have the right to tell you
you are overextending yourself,
not just once every few years
when you renew your credit card agreement,
but for every transaction
you have to be able to underwrite and
decide yes or no for every single moment
that you create these payment plans.
Because that allows us to not lose money
because we are aligned with you.
When you pay us back on time,
we'll make some money.
If you don't,
we're just going to be worse off.
And so that is the foundation of a firm's
take on Bnpl.
Many people have come along since
and sort of change the model a little bit.
They introduce late fees,
all kinds of other fees we never have.
And never will.
But even with those modifications,
the model is still better
than credit cards because of this
individual underwriting moment.
In our case,
no fees of any kind just to be clear.
So let's say I wind up at some website
and maybe I want to buy
like some Nike's or something like that.
And I see the affirm option.
How does how do you know
how good of a credit I am in that moment?
So it's
not a effort free thing for you to use
affirm.
You'll have to click on affirm,
and we will ask you
if you've ever seen you before.
It will ask you to provide
some information for us.
That information will allow us to tap
into the standard set of records
that the credit bureaus
aggregated about you.
If there's enough data there
for us to use our custom credit score,
we'll render a decision based on that.
If there's not, we'll actually say, hey,
we don't fully understand
your personal financial situation.
We would like to have a peek at your bank
account, cash flow, and decide
how your cash ebbs and flows
relative to your ability to pay us back.
All of this is made possible
with really good new technology,
so this takes seconds,
even though it probably takes about
as long to do as it takes to describe it.
But we'll look through your personal
financial state of right now
and make a decision,
not just whether it's a yes or no,
but also how much of a risk you have
of that financial situation changing
and that price is the credit.
Do you use any like, creative data points
you mentioned?
Checking against like the type of item
that people are buying.
So that's one thing
I imagine could be interesting.
Like if people are buying
groceries on installment, does that mean
they're more of a credit risk
than someone who is, I don't know,
buying a computer or a big ticket item?
And then the other thing
I'm very curious about,
and I think I've told this story before
on all lots,
but I remember going to see, a startup
that eventually failed,
and they were in the peer
to peer lending space,
and they described some of the stuff
they were doing with underwriting,
where they were like trying to measure
people's impulsiveness
by how quickly they moved
a slider for a loan and stuff like that,
which freaked me out a little at the time.
It would freak me out, too.
So, no, we do not do, telemetry
as a input variable into underwriting.
So before I get into what we do use,
it bears mentioning that
the variables you use in underwriting
is a very, very highly regulated
domain of lending and underwriting.
There's lots and lots of laws going back
quite far, things like Fair Credit Act
and any other sort of subsequent additions
to both federal and state level law
that prohibits you from using kind
of the obvious things you wouldn't want
people to use, like your race
or your gender or your age or your creed.
Cannot be a factor.
It's actually a federal offense
to do that.
And so we don't do any of those things.
We go as far as to say if it correlates
to some of those things,
we also couldn't use it.
And that too is a subsequent law as well.
So, so so first of all, we're very,
very thoughtful about making
sure we don't step into a prohibited
territory.
That's called prohibited basis as the,
the fancy term in the industry.
What we can use and what we do use,
as you mentioned, merchants
share with us what's being purchased
despite the burrito
gate that sometimes,
comes back in the press,
people don't actually use affirm
to finance Mexican food or other cuisines.
They do sometimes use affirm
for groceries, but it mostly is,
or almost entirely really is for things
like I'm throwing a giant party
and I need several hundred dollars
worth of foodstuffs,
and that's a lot to pay down
with my debit card.
So I'm going to use a firm instead.
So the average sized
transactions for us is roughly $300.
So it gives you a sense
for like what people use a firm for.
So that's just,
you know, apropos apropos
where it's being used, what we glean
from the information
about what's being purchased,
one good mental model,
which this is like an approximation,
but but a decent one
if the useful life of the item
is meaningfully shorter
than the time it takes you to pay it back,
you may find yourself
questioning the quality of the item
long afterwards disappeared.
And so a natural question
we should be asking is
what do we understand about this item?
But also maybe these items
history of quality.
Before we say,
oh yeah, sure, buy this thing
that's going to be out in six months
and pay for it over two years.
So maybe the most useful thing I can say
about actually what variables,
what new variables we've introduced
into our underwriting a vast, vast, vast
majority of them, in fact,
all of them actually in
influence, a decision
we make by 1 or 2% at most.
Anytime someone tells you
I found this magic variable, and if I just
look at that, it's like 30%
better underwriting or 5% better defaults.
They're lying
probably to themselves more than to you,
but they're definitely lying.
Anything like that
just immediately becomes brittle
as the macroeconomic reality changes,
as people suddenly
don't care about the item
or whatever it is that they found.
As this magic bullet of like,
suddenly I know who's a good risk,
it just disappears.
And so you actually want lots
and lots of subtle factors
that are also compliant
with all the various regulations helping
you shape a score that will tell you
how likely this person is to pay back.
And that's what we use.
Let's go back to the
just the core of the business model.
So let's imagine
there is a shirt that costs $100
and I have an opportunity to okay, I'm
going to buy it, with a firm.
So to be for payments of $25
and there's no interest.
And so for me,
there is almost a free lunch
because the time value of money, etc..
All right.
I'm spreading this out over four payments.
You're going to get that 100 in an index.
And then I'm going to get that extra,
that extra $75 after the first payment
I'm going to know.
And so you make money
because the retailer is paying you a cut
because that you've brought
someone into the door.
So talk about how is that gut determined?
What how much are they paying
you for that?
And how competitive
is that against other potential Bnpl
companies, or perhaps new entrants
that haven't come into the market yet?
Talk to us about how that prices for them.
This is my question too, because
when you go to check out, you see buttons.
And the buttons,
I presume don't mean that much to people.
You just click one of them.
So how do you differentiate yourself?
We've been around for nearly 15 years,
and the way we've differentiated ourselves
by the way we basically don't advertise.
When you see us a checkout, that's
when you learn about a firm at some point
and then you come back to use again.
And we have incredible retention rates.
People who have used a firm
a couple of times, basically with 90%
probability, will come back to use a firm
again, not necessarily the next week.
In fact, we average something like five
plus transactions per year.
But when it matters to them,
they will use a firm.
And the way we differentiate ourselves is
we were there for them when they needed us
and if they ever stumbled.
Our best customers
are the ones that email us or call us
and say, hey, I was late to pay my bill,
something happened.
What's the late fee?
And we tell them there isn't one.
That's the moment when they grasp
how we're different
from the rest of the industry, and that
that's probably why they come back to us
as often, as much as they do.
Something like 95% of our transactions
come from repeat customers.
So just to give you a sense
for the loyalty
that we've engendered in our user base
without ever making promises,
you know, in on broadcast media,
that's sort of why they come back
to the business model point.
So first of all, probably worth
expanding the aperture a little bit.
So we offer both interest free
and not interest free loans.
The paying for the Joe
described is exactly as it sounds.
So in our case
there are no fees of any kind.
So if you see $100 shirt and you say it's
going to be for payments of $25,
that is it.
You cannot you can take a decade
and you wouldn't be able to use affirm
pretty soon after you went
well past the window of repayment.
So the punishment for
for being late for too long is, hey,
you need to pay us back actually, before
you can do this again, which I think
stands to reason much more than actually
let us hit you with a $30 late fee.
But that's beside the point.
So that's one form of transaction.
We also have what we call longer term
zeros, which is for $1,000 fancy suit.
You could potentially get a loan
from a firm for 24 months
or even 36 months,
which will also be zero.
In both of those cases, it's the retailer
that's effectively paying your interest
on value of money
becomes even more expensive in six months.
So you've sort of
you've nailed the business model there.
In some situations.
The retailer just doesn't have the margin
or isn't interested
in paying your interest.
And so they'll say, look,
you're going to use credit card,
you'll pay some interest.
If you're going to use a firm, it's
okay for
for us to have this transaction happen.
If you are willing to pay interest
to a firm.
And in that scenario,
you will see both the principal
and interest
will calculate for you
both the rate and the dollars.
And we'll show you the schedule.
And before you commit to any of that,
you will see and agree to the schedule
that we agree on.
In the latter case,
the consumer is paying us something.
The merchant is probably paying us
something
significantly less
than what they're paying us.
If they're absorbing the cost of interest,
the cost of time, value of money.
The business model is really,
really simple.
In our case, to understand
the value is fixed,
so whoever is paying us
almost doesn't matter.
That has to cover the fixed cost of
underwriting, servicing all the usual bits
leave a little bit for us to actually be
a profitable company, which we are.
And also absorb the probability
of default, which, by the way,
sort of all the way back to this alignment
of incentives and easy check.
Like so
did it work like this whole idea of like,
oh, you know,
you're just not going to profit
when people stumble.
Our delinquency rates are about half
the industry of credit cards.
That should give you a sense for
we don't make nearly as many mistakes.
Or perhaps we are not willing
to let people go late
because we don't benefit from it.
Back to the business model.
That's how it works.
The competitiveness of this industry
is just like any other competitiveness
of any payment.
Industry payments
are notoriously a competitive world.
There's actually never been
a monopoly in payments.
Full stop is a fun puzzle.
I used to do cocktail parties
like name a monopoly in payments.
It turns out there has never been one.
I go to talking to all
about cocktail parties. Yeah,
I you know, there's a reason I'm
a fan of the show, right?
I listen to, to, to you opine
and all sorts of esoteric things
with, with great gusto.
And so I think that's
we'll tell you everything you want to know
about the competitiveness
of the, of the space.
But we have decided
from the very beginning that we want
transparency and honesty with everyone
involved, with our borrowers.
That's why we say everything upfront.
That's why we tell them, here's
your disclosure on exactly the rates
and the schedules with our merchants.
We tell them, here is the price
you will have to pay us
if that's where you're paying.
If you can't, don't want to, that's fine.
We will probably not be the right
one for you.
We won't make it up elsewhere.
We're not going to take it out of the
consumers hide when they least expect it.
That's just not the brand.
There are definitely cheaper
providers out there.
There are plenty of brands
that will say we're just like a firm,
but way less expensive for merchants.
What that really means is that's because
we charge all sorts of hidden fees.
We have all sorts of other ways
of taking it out of consumers skin.
What this
means practically,
with 15 years of experience is consumers
as they cast their eye
over the list of buttons,
they say, well, the one I want to use
is the one that's not going to get me.
If I stumble.
And that makes for 24 million
active users in the last 12 months.
And we feel like we've
we've kept our promise and the consumers
keep coming back.
Just reiterating Joe's question, though,
on the merchant side again,
I imagine they're getting offers
from a bunch of different, installment
lenders, Bnpl companies,
and I don't think they do.
They care much about the underwriting.
It's not really their problem.
It's your problem. Right.
So I assume the thing they care
most about is the fee,
which seems like they actually care
about three things.
Okay. So they absolutely care
about the fee like that.
Without it, which which can range
from as low as less than credit card.
So a typical credit card rate
today is on the order of between
two and a half and 3%,
depending on the size of the merchant.
But that's kind of the average
in the industry.
We will definitely
meet you around those numbers
at the absolute lowest,
and goes up all the way
to, let's say, low single
digit percentage points when you are
subsidizing consumer interest.
So we are not a cheaper than credit cards
provider like that.
That's not you know,
they want anybody to have that illusion.
They care about the rate
more than the rates.
They care about incremental sales.
So if your next marginal buyer is either a
no thanks or it will cost you 5%,
if you have the margin of better than 5%,
you don't want the item
staying on your shelves.
You would like to pay this 5%
to get the marginal buyer to say yes
and so because of that incentive,
which I think is easy to follow,
you do have lots and lots of merchants
that say, all right,
so what I really care about
then is the approval rates,
which is the second variable
we care about.
So as people come through and say,
hey, I'm not going to use a credit card,
not interested in buying unless I have an
installment loan, let's say from a firm.
They need to know that that rate
is going to be high enough.
Otherwise why have a button that just sits
there and looks pretty?
And so our rates are typically higher
than the rest of the industry because
we are so obsessed with underwriting,
because we have no crutches e.g.
late fees.
And so this underwriting thing, I don't
we don't really try to explain it
to merchants at all.
What do we do? Say,
look at our approval rates.
If you see their approvals reach
a meaningfully higher than the industry,
you know
you're going to get value from this.
That's why
it's worth paying more than credit cards.
And so that is true.
And that's that's what they do.
The third piece they do care about
every merchant knows that.
The second transaction is they want
they want the first transaction
cost them
probably more than the margin in it.
They're paying Google,
they're paying Facebook.
They'll soon be paying an Elm provider
or Chatterbot provider
to drive that first transaction in.
They want to sell you another thing.
So they very much care about
if they had sold that first transaction
using a buy now, pay later
provider, it better not harm their brand
because if they buy now, pay later
provider is harassing the consumer
for paying them back, or has late fees
or has unexpected fees.
It's going to accrete
negatively to the merchants brand.
And so they actually do
care about lead fees
in a way that has less to do
with financial consequences,
be more with will people come back to us
and use our firm again?
Or will they be like,
oh, I hated that merchant.
I got into some bad transaction.
So they care about all these things
through their own lens.
That makes a lot of sense.
So let's say
I start accepting your premise.
Okay?
This is per se better than, credit card.
One reason that people can't
just sort of quit credit cards
generally is not every place takes buy
now, pay later.
People want something
in their wallet, right?
They want something at the restaurant.
And wherever it is
that they know it's going to be accepted.
Now, if you are launching a card
or you have a card, right, we have a card
okay around for a couple years.
So you have a card.
But I'm curious, you know, you
you mentioned you referenced
that recent episode
that we did with our Drexler.
And one of the things that he said about
cards is they're very costly to advertise.
The marketing expenditure for the card
companies is very high.
You mentioned that
you don't do a lot of advertising.
I'm curious, though, on the card component
specifically, is that going to be,
you know, if you want to be, quote,
top of wallet to consumers?
The first thing
I think I've heard that phrase, I sorry.
That's right.
I'm laughing because I'm really I'm
trying to claim myself with the industry
lingo, your true insider,
that if you do that, that's, you.
So if you want to be top of wallet
for the consumer and in the card,
can you do that
with an advertising lite model,
or do you really need to spend
to get significant wallet?
Sure you can.
The card is available to our users.
So this is not a thing that you'll see on
times Square displays.
This is a thing you find out from affirm
once you are a borrower.
Once you're actually in good standing,
you qualify for the affirm card
as the hey, you really liked
us, didn't you?
This was great.
You're transacting five times a year.
If you want to take us with you
to your retail,
shopping experiences, restaurant
or otherwise, we have a way.
It's called the affirm card.
It's actually pretty magical.
The card is a dual mode card.
It switches from debit to credit
explicitly as you tell it to.
And so when you're buying a burrito,
we expect you to use the debit mode,
which just literally takes the money
from your account and that's it.
There's no interest,
obviously, it's just a paynow transaction.
If you're buying a TV,
you can buy it now with affirm in the app,
you say, hey, my next transaction.
I want that to be a 12 months to 0% loan
because the retailer wants you to have it
interest free.
Maybe you're paying some interest,
but you're setting up
that transaction in the app
and then your card is ready
when you tap it.
Next time it becomes a loan automatically.
It's a pretty magical experience.
It's super popular.
It's a it's a thing that we haven't
needed to advertise because we went from,
we have this card idea
to about 12% of our users having one very,
very quickly because it's just a really,
really good product.
Again, our user,
their mindset has long been changed from
revolving is okay, I don't understand it,
but I don't care to.
I don't like revolving.
I don't want to pay late fees.
I don't want to pay excessive interest.
This affirm thing is neat.
The card is a logical next step.
It's how much more can I have
of this type of financial life?
How much insight do you have into,
how much people are borrowing
from other Bnpl lenders?
So the sort of stacking issue,
which has been discussed multiple times
now, it's a great question.
We have a decent insight in the sense
that we understand
pretty
well the overlap between user basis.
So there's two prongs to his answer,
and this one, it's worth
delving into pretty deeply,
because this is where we differ
from the rest of the industry
pretty significantly.
So before I get into the stacking
part, I'll address the, the overlap.
So we do a lot of studying
just externally through surveys.
Also because
when we log into your bank account
or we ask a provider to log into your bank
account and pull in
some of your transactional data,
we get a glimpse into
what else you're spending money on.
So we have a decent sense for where else
you might be using buy now, pay later.
And to date, the user base overlap
with other providers is quite minimal,
so there's not a whole lot of stacking
possibility simply because people
who use affirm tend to state with affirm
they sometimes straight and use
other providers, but it's quite minimal
for a meaningfully lower
transactional amount.
I think we average a
significantly higher average transaction
relative to the rest of the industry.
So far, that's not been a problem
in the long term.
You, of course, can make the argument
like, sure,
right now you guys are all still tiny.
You're growing really quickly.
Everybody's taken a bite
out of the credit card industry.
What happens five years from now
when everyone has signed up
for their favorite deal, and they're
now signing up for a second one?
The right way to address this problem,
and this is the right way.
And it's it's traditionalist of me,
but I really do believe is the right
way is for everyone
to report to the credit bureaus.
Today, when we tap into one of the three
major credit bureaus,
we see what you're borrowing
and relatively current
state of your borrowing
from other traditional sources of credit.
And it is a variable that we use inside
of our own underwriting.
A firm
today is the only one that furnishes.
That's another fancy industry
term, delivers the data of both positive
and negative as you're on time,
you're not on time to the credit bureaus.
The rest of our competitive set,
generally speaking, does not.
Although everyone has experimented
a little bit from the very beginning,
we saw the idea of building credit history
and improving credit scores
for people who are on time
as a key value proposition
for our borrower, like
we are not going to be the only lender
for our consumers that each bar for a card
they need to borrow for a house one day.
That means whatever they're doing with us,
especially if they're doing
well, which 97% of our consumers are doing
really, really well.
They're on time all the time.
It has to reflect
in their permanent record somehow.
So we've been furnishing basically
from the very beginning.
It took a long time to persuade
not just the credit bureaus,
but also the companies that provide
traditional credit scores to understand
the data
we furnish and treat it in the right way,
so that when you are on time,
the scores go up,
when you're not on time,
the scores go down, etc..
And so we did all that work basically
on a volunteer basis over the last decade.
And today, right now,
the state of the industry is if you are a
Bnpl provider and you're not furnishing
data, you kind of have no excuse.
Like, we pioneered this,
we did all the work, we worked with
the score builders and the credit bureaus,
and we're now sending all of our data.
And so we want everyone to join us.
Because most people do pay on time,
their credit histories should reflect
their good repayment, but also people
who should not be borrowing
should be reflected.
And I think that's just really,
really important.
If I can, if I can do
one bit of advertising on your show,
it won't be for a firm. It will be
all of you out there.
If you are in a buy now, pay later
industry, furnish your damn data.
It will help consumers and it will
eventually agreed to your brand too.
But for now, we are the only major one.
Wait, what's the resistance then?
Because it seems kind of obvious.
If everyone cares about the underwriting,
you would want more data out there.
So why not provide it?
So I don't want to pretend
that I understand all the motivations,
but I think a basic inferential
thought might occur that if you're making
a lot of money from late fees,
it's a cool thing to tell your consumers,
don't worry,
you can just pay me off
and it won't go on your permanent record.
And if you don't make any money from late
fees, you have no incentive
to tell your consumers,
oh, it's okay, just pay me some sum and,
we won't tell on you.
The connection between late fees
and lack of reporting
is unfortunately, the, the underlying fact
that because we don't make any money
from late fees, because we don't charge
any, we're very pro reporting
just out of curiosity.
So if you're talking about late fees
and credit and all that stuff
here we are
recording this on December 2nd, 2025.
You have any, you take the temperature
of the consumer for us.
I don't think you're doing
seeing any signs of growing
missed payments or anything like that.
Not as of December 2nd, 2025.
The important thing to understand
I I'm asked this question fairly often.
I am a great I am a firm is a great lens
into the financial hearts
and minds of North American consumer.
Operate in the US, Canada and now UK.
It is a specific set of people.
These people
are more financially responsible.
They made a conscious choice.
They picked us
not just because it's installment pay.
And yeah, it's convenient.
It's also because we told them
we don't charge late fees.
It's also because we told them
he'd be asterisk next to the 0%.
We don't have any asterisks. And
one of our core values is no fine print.
And we mean it. And on and on and on.
And so it stands to reason that affirm
consumers will be probably much later
into any kind of a macro economic
earthquake territory.
If there was one to come.
But as of right now, we're we feel quite
good about our book
and also about the U.S.
consumer.
I'm going to ask you a question and,
I'm going to mention a competitor.
I won't make you name the competitor,
but I'll just say it my question
and then I'll ask you about.
So one of your competitors,
Klarna, recently announced a new dollar
pegged stablecoin. And I'm very cynical.
And so when I see, like, random companies
announcing some crypto thing, like
sometimes it makes sense, but,
but often it's like, well, maybe is this
just a good press
release or something like that?
And I haven't really looked
at the Klarna one.
The but for you affirm right now,
when you look at and you as someone
who has been in the internet payment
trenches for literally decades right
now, does do stablecoins or anything
crypto unlock anything for you right now?
When you think about the future
and you think about opportunities
that you can't do with traditional rails,
the short answer is I don't think so.
Now, I'm also very cynical,
so I think you're unfortunately tapping
into the exact same mind flow
that that you have.
This is our way of asking them
to want to come on the podcast and have
argue against it, but keep going,
keep going.
I, you know, I, I am confident that
there is some
thought that went to the press release.
So I don't think it's a pure
press release.
So I will, I will I get
I try to tell us about I won't make you.
We're not going to make
you speculate on a competitor, but just
tell us about from different perspective.
Sure I will strawman
the reasons why. Yes.
So why not is obvious.
I think you probably can do
a much better job than I can.
The why? Yes.
So there are a couple of reasons.
One, in general, if you have a lot of
cross-border commerce,
foreign exchange,
the complexity of just diligence around,
you know, everything from sanctions
to reserve accounts,
etc., you can sort of squint
a little and say, you know what?
If we just lived in dollar
pegged stablecoins everywhere all at once,
it would be a little bit easier.
And I think that's true.
E-commerce is not
a very significantly
cross-border discipline.
And so before you sort of say,
oh, wouldn't it be amazing if I bought
lots of things from Zanzibar
and just paid them with a firm,
but they got stablecoin
as a settlement currency,
they'll be very happy
because they want dollars in
this thing is essentially dollar
equivalent. It's a good story.
Just most people in the US
don't buy a lot of things from Zanzibar.
They buy some things in other countries,
but most of the time,
because we all want things shipped to us
very, very quickly,
we're probably buying it from a US
subsidiary that's warehouses somewhere
pretty close to the US, and so it's
not that big of a market just yet.
But in like five years, if you see me
putting out a press release, it's
not because I finally realized
that I'm missing out.
It's because there's enough
cross-border commerce in our scale
where it starts to make a difference.
That's the best I got in terms of
why would you want to do this?
The obvious of why nots.
It's like, well, maybe you want to
move money around person to person,
but that's not our business.
Maybe you want to believe that one day
Joe will have
a wallet full of stablecoins.
I really have a hard time
imagining you supporting a whole bunch
of different kinds of brand.
A dollar pegged, effectively equivalent
stablecoins like a coupon book of
I got my affirm stablecoin
and my brand XYZ stablecoin,
and I'm going to choose between the two
like none of that.
Maybe some of the like.
What about for like rewards?
Like, you know,
that's one thing that credit cards
currently have that like, oh, I get miles.
Like, could there be something with
if I use the stablecoin, I get remitted,
but I don't know.
I'm just I'm just throwing stuff
out. So for what it's worth,
I spend a lot of my
time contemplating the word ecosystem
and mostly raging against it
because it is one of the less documented
wealth transfers.
And by the way, the credit card
industry in general is a regressive wealth
transfer where people
who never evolve transactions,
like probably both of you and me,
when I use credit cards,
which is really rare
these days, we're paying our bills.
At the end of the month,
we're not paying a penny of interest.
I think Joe on the record
saying you've never paid any interest.
And so I think that, that, that, that
that's a nice place to be,
if you can afford it, telling people
that they should just not borrow
and pay it off at the end of the month
is an incredibly let them eat cake
equivalent for the 21st century, payments.
Lots of people in America revolve
half the country involved in a $10,000,
and so the idea of those people caring
about rewards is sort of preposterous.
They do not.
They care about making their minimum
payment.
People who are figuring out which
reward scheme they want to be a part of.
I, I'm
just not so convinced that they're going
to be
expanding their horizons
to have more stable coins,
because ultimately they're
they're getting dollars in the world
of a firm people that are people
that we serve every single day,
24 million of them in the last 12 months.
They really, really care
about the interest rates they pay,
because a lot of them understand
that the alternative is revolving.
And so for them being told, hey,
your reward is a 0% loan
is incredibly powerful.
And so before we get into
using our hard
earned revenue into stablecoins,
we will just give it back to the consumers
in the form of no, no interest.
So we talked about how you make money,
but we should talk a little bit
about your cost side as well.
And you mentioned funding earlier.
So you have to get money from somewhere
and you're paying for that money.
What levers do you have to pull
if the cost of money goes up?
And again,
I'm aware that we're recording this
in early December
and everyone expects an imminent rate cut.
But in theory,
if interest rates were to go
up, what could you do to
offset that additional cost?
So the most important thing to understand
about our business,
from the capital sourcing
part of the game,
everyone understands
that rates are not super volatile.
But, you know, if you look back a couple
of years, they were very volatile.
If for for a brief, 
not so shining moment.
And so we all knew it was possible.
So all of our contracts
with various lenders of money to us,
but also people who will buy our loans,
the all adjust
fairly gently over a course of a fairly
long period of time.
So it's not about can we deal
with rising costs of credit for us, it's
how quickly do they change for us?
And of course, we understand
that they might change quickly.
Therefore, a lot of our contracts
stipulate that, hey, if they do move up,
the adjustments to our cost will go fairly
slowly over a period of time.
So the more likely outcome in
December is probably a downward motion
of the current rates.
Or perhaps they stay steady,
but just the same as I described,
we're not going to wake up to all 25 three
basis points of incremental revenue.
It will eventually come to us in a form
of accrual margin, but it'll take its time
because these contracts adjust
both up and down quite slowly.
And we're in no way
unique in the industry.
Everybody does that.
The levers
we have to deal with such cost changes
are exactly what you would expect.
So we will either pass it
through to the consumers and moving up
in the increments or down of 25 basis
points is not that significant.
Then most people,
I think, generally don't care that much.
In some cases, we actually choose to tell,
hey merchant X,
you are providing these rates for nothing.
You should continue doing so, but the cost
to you will go up a tiny bit because
the rate of change
now, because of time value of money,
the merchants pay us in real time,
essentially as a transaction
is consummated,
the true cost to them is truly de minimis.
And so in either of these two cases,
so long as the movements
are not very violent, it's not that major
a component of our business.
I just have one last question.
I so setting aside the technology
for the underwriting,
which I'm sure is very high tech, data
intensive application and setting aside
that, probably many of your engineers on
staff are using code generating for that.
Just putting your tech hat on.
As someone who oversees
a large organization, people looking for
how large language models in particular
are being deployed in productive capacity
at a firm today, is any of this technology
in use in production
and saving human hours
in some respect or another?
Yes. Emphatically so.
So we just wrapped up the
Cyber Weekend, Turkey
five, Black Friday, Cyber Monday,
whatever, whatever you want to call.
I don't actually have the stat yet
because I will get the report immediately
after this podcast is recorded,
but I'm constantly,
well, I probably can't,
pronounce the results
we report early next year,
but we will have handled
tens of thousands of consumer contacts,
people saying everything from, hey,
I just borrowed money from you
and I don't understand
when my first payment is due.
And, you know, maybe it's
because they hadn't
read the emails clearly
or everything all the way down to
I just borrowed money
and I realized that I need a refund
because I actually have no intention
of buying this thing
and all this stuff, and a lot of it.
We try to serve them in real time
as they're transacting,
but plenty of people contact us
right after or maybe sometime, you know,
after the purchase.
A huge percentage
of that is handled entirely by AI.
Now, now,
that has not caused us to lay off
our wonderful customer service
staff at all.
What it has allowed us to do
is to go really deep into specialization.
AI is very, very good today
at handling basic questions.
It can do cool things like look up
your account and say, no, you're not late,
you're mistaken. Don't worry about it.
Or yes, you're late,
but we don't charge late fees.
So just please make yourself current
and we'll move on.
All of that can be handled by
AI wonderfully.
If it's something like
I changed my name or,
you know, I changed where I live, right
as I was consummating this transaction,
there's all sorts of crazy
things that come up out of
that is something that a human can handle.
AI models are not smart enough yet
to handle some of these things,
and also frequently, if we wouldn't want
the possibility of hallucination to derail
what is a good customer relationship.
So we've been able to move
our human helpers
into a much more sophisticated,
much more specific role.
So the theme in our customer service
for last year has been
specialization, specialization,
specialization where we train people now
to serve very,
very specific subset of problems
because they can be effective
and move faster.
And so these tools
are actually making them more efficient
by letting them focus on just a
very specific thing that they're good at.
So that's one example.
We track all sorts of interesting metrics
about AI tool usage internally.
The interesting or sort of random factoid,
our engineering group is not the single
largest consumer of AI tools.
I will not reveal exactly who it is.
And by the way, the vast majority
or cannot reveal who it is.
Give us a hint or something.
It's actually finance.
Our, finite finance
group uses these tools obsessively.
I'm cheating a little bit here.
So for a very long time
it's not the case anymore,
but for a very long time, because we are
so AI and ML heavy company.
One of the core requirements for any
employee, but certainly in finance, was
you have to know how to read code
and probably write code.
And so huge percentage
of what we do in our finance group
actually looks a lot like coding
and a lot of software engineering.
And so but there's some how maybe
because the smaller group on average.
But, they're great
adopters of these tools.
Our legal team uses it all the time.
We have literally hundreds of thousands
of very custom contracts.
Every time a merchant pays your interest
for you, they signed up for it.
Contractually, that's a custom contract.
Imagine managing
half a million of these things.
They're all carefully written and spoken,
so I can read
and find errors and corrections,
etcetera, etcetera.
We use.
So one of the things we're responsible
for as a regulated business is
we cannot allow merchants
to advertise our service incorrectly.
We're actually on the hook when a merchant
says something like hooray!
Affirm
interest free for everyone. It's not true.
Some people will actually pay
some interest sometimes.
And so we have to.
We are responsible for finding that
and telling the merchant,
please stop saying things that aren't.
Strictly speaking, true.
AI tools are amazing at reading boatloads
of advertising copy and saying hey,
this second, that is inaccurate.
We got a fire off an email
and tell this merchant to fix it
so you can sort of
imagine a flood of ideas that we had
with the ChatGPT moment happen,
and put it to work for the last few years.
I'm going to end with,
a sort of theoretical question,
big picture theoretical question.
But if you could design the ideal
payment system
from scratch, complete scratch,
you know, using today's technology,
there's no legacy card networks,
maybe not even legacy banks.
What would it look like,
and how much of a firm's
current business model
would sort of survive in that environment?
Well, I think
you would look an awful lot like a firm.
A firm is my personal attempt
to build a system
that I can be proud about.
One of the core things we tell people
who join us, one of the reasons we had
this such a black and white, no late fees,
no compounding, no deferred interest.
None of the yuck is
because I wanted the smartest people
that would have otherwise gone
to Wall Street and traded in quant funds
to join us and build the system
that they could be proud about.
It's very hard to be proud about a thing
that makes half its money and late fees,
and that's why we don't do it.
And so what we've built is biased as I am.
It's pretty darn great.
It really is something
that I'm very proud about.
And I think the totality of the team here
takes an enormous amount of pride in
how we went about building this.
It is dependent, intertwined
with the legacy systems.
But even as we go through guardrails
to use another industry jargon
or many other systems that have existed,
when we tap into capital markets,
which are certainly been here long
before we came about, and everything else
in between, we maintain the moral
integrity of the product and
its DNA all the way through.
We might pay late fees
if we borrow money to lend.
We haven't, because obviously
we're on a pretty tight ship here.
It will not be pass through.
We take an incredible amount of pride
in the diligence
we exercise within the system,
all the way down to leaving a penny
on the table for our partners
to keep because we refuse
to make more money than we said we would.
And so I would love to have a blank sheet
design exercise in payments.
But I think what would emerge is a system
that looks a lot like a firm,
just doesn't
have some of the 1980s craft in it.
Max Levchin, founder and CEO of a firm.
So great chatting with you.
Very illuminating, helpful conversation,
and I appreciate you coming on our lot.
Tricia I thought that was great.
I thought that was really interesting
and just sort of understanding
the real nuts and bolts
about how the money is made
and what's different
about the Bnpl companies
from the credit card companies,
to my mind, very helpful conversation.
Yeah, I thought it was really interesting,
the discussion about why
other Bnpl companies don't want to report.
Yeah,
the credit bureaus and things like that.
You know,
I wonder if that'll change, anytime soon.
Maybe politicians will start
getting interested in it.
Regulators as the space expands.
A thought that I had listening
to Max was,
he mentioned the sort of the regressive
ness of the point system.
Right.
So there's people like us
who rarely roll their credit card,
but get frequent
flier miles or other rewards, etc.
but that's paid for by the people
that roll, right?
Or sorry,
that's paid for by the people who roll.
Now, if affirm is targeting,
they're not they're clearly targeting
people who are not thinking about points.
Right.
They're thinking about people
who really do need
to extend their payments or implicitly
roll and say, we have a better option.
So it's sort of cleaving off if,
you know, if this grows, the firm
is still just a $22 billion company,
by market cap.
Whatever this grows, you gotta wonder,
like if in the maximal version
where you've cleaved off
a significant number of people who roll,
what happens to the point ecosystem
for the people like us?
Now, granted, I don't think like, oh,
what about the poor freaking flier
and all the great rewards you're getting,
but you just someone think the point?
Well,
someone please think about the points.
Accumulators who never go into debt
or who never, like, roll their debt.
But it is interesting to think about,
if you could, like, cleave off that,
then a big part of the business model
of credit card, the legacy card companies
could potentially be unstable
and part of the appeal
of going to any credit card
that offers a lot of rewards
could decline if revolvers
moved to this alternate payment model.
Yeah, it's a really good point.
Yeah, it's a really good point on points.
Okay.
Thank you.
That one was a little obvious I'm sorry.
No it's good
I like that it was straightforward.
I actually got this one.
Okay. Actually you know what?
I really also appreciated
that Max had substantive answers
for things that they're doing with
AI that aren't just code generation.
Even if it sounds like
