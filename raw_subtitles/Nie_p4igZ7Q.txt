 Joe,
 do
 you
 like
 Persian


food?


>> Yeah.
 Oh,
 yeah.
 Definitely.


>> Yeah.
 I
 make
 I'm
 very
 proud
 of
 this
 if
 I


say
 so
 myself.
 A
 mean
 gourmet
 sapsi.
 I


actually
 don't
 know
 if
 I'm
 pronouncing


it
 wrong,
 but
 supposedly
 it's
 the


Iranian
 national
 dish,
 and
 it's
 a
 sort


of
 like
 beef
 stew
 with
 spinach
 and
 a


bunch
 of
 different
 herbs
 in
 it.
 So,
 it's


really
 green
 and
 then
 with
 kidney
 beans,


it's
 delicious.
 And
 the
 thing
 I
 like


about
 it
 is
 you
 can
 make
 it
 and
 then


store
 it,
 freeze
 it,
 and
 it
 actually


gets
 better
 over
 the
 next
 week
 or
 so.


>> I
 This
 is
 my
 idea
 for
 a
 restaurant,


which
 is
 just
 like
 make
 food
 and
 then


put
 it
 in
 the
 fridge
 for
 overnight
 and


then
 serve
 it
 cold
 cuz
 I
 think
 like


every
 dish
 is
 better
 like
 after
 a
 night


in
 the
 fridge
 somehow
 like
 all
 the


flavors
 come
 out.
 I
 was
 like,
 why
 don't


we
 just
 make
 this
 the
 default
 eating?


I
 did
 a
 deadlift.


>> I
 am
 both
 the
 most
 popular
 trader
 and


most
 successful
 trader
 at
 Citadel.


>> Feta's
 going
 viral.


>> Uh,
 barges.


>> This
 is
 an
 after
 school
 special.
 Except


>> I've
 decided
 I'm
 going
 to
 base
 my
 entire


personality
 going
 forward
 on
 campaigning


for
 a
 strategic
 pork
 reserve
 in
 the
 US.


>> Black
 gold.


>> These
 are
 the
 the
 important
 questions.


Is
 it
 robots
 taking
 over
 the
 world?


>> No,
 I
 think
 that
 like
 in
 a
 couple
 years


the
 AI
 will
 do
 a
 really
 good
 job
 of


making
 the
 Outlaws
 podcast.
 One
 day
 that


person
 will
 have
 the
 mandate
 of
 heaven.


>> How
 do
 I
 get
 more
 popular
 and


successful?


>> We
 do
 have


>> the
 perfect
 guest.


>> You're
 listening
 to
 lots
 more
 where
 we


catch
 up
 with
 friends
 about
 what's
 going


on
 right
 now.


>> Because
 even
 when
 Odd
 Lots
 is
 over,


there's
 always
 lots
 more.


>> And
 we
 really
 do
 have
 the
 perfect
 guest.


>> So,
 I'm
 a
 big
 fan
 of
 Iranian
 food.
 I


always
 wanted
 to
 go
 to
 Iran
 and
 actually


try
 it.


>> Yes.
 And
 it
 makes
 me
 sad
 that
 I
 haven't


been
 able
 to
 do
 it.
 And
 with,
 you
 know,


recent
 events,
 terrible
 events
 in
 Iran,


we've
 had
 anti-Islamic
 Republic
 protests


that
 have
 reportedly
 left
 thousands
 of


people
 dead.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 say
 the


specific
 estimate
 because
 it's
 changing


all
 the
 time.
 And
 also,
 there's
 not
 that


much
 transparency
 at
 the
 moment
 because


the
 government
 has
 shut
 down
 the
 entire


internet.
 But
 it's
 just
 sad.


>> Look,
 I
 know
 very
 little
 about
 Iran.
 I


also
 feel
 like
 in
 my
 professional
 career


there
 are
 multiple
 rounds
 of
 this


>> big
 protests
 etc.
 Is
 this
 the
 moment


regime
 change?
 And
 to
 your
 point
 which


you
 say
 like
 there
 is
 very
 little
 that
 I


trust
 when
 I
 see
 it
 reported.
 I
 am


extremely
 skeptical.
 Oh,
 tonight
 was
 the


biggest
 set
 of
 protests
 we've
 had
 in


years.
 There's
 never
 been
 a
 protest.


Look
 at
 which
 city
 this
 is.
 I'm
 sure


there
 are
 well-informed
 people
 talking


about
 this.
 I
 don't
 have
 the
 heristics


to
 know
 generally
 I
 don't
 know
 who
 is


well
 informed
 what
 is
 actually
 signal


versus
 what
 is
 noise
 but
 obviously
 yet


another
 sort
 of
 extraordinary


development
 unfolding
 here
 in
 uh
 2026


>> ma
 what
 have
 you
 been
 hearing


>> so
 I
 agree
 that
 it's
 difficult
 really
 to


tell
 what
 are
 the
 actual
 facts
 for
 sure


there's
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 deaths
 and
 uh
 it's


horrible
 and
 it's
 tragic
 and
 it's


definitely
 in
 thousands
 of
 of
 of
 deaths


but
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 you
 know,
 there's


complete
 blackout.
 What
 works
 right
 now


is
 the
 actually
 outgoing
 landline
 calls


but
 with
 limited
 time.
 So,
 for
 example,


my
 one
 of
 my
 analysts
 who
 is
 actually
 in


London
 at
 the
 moment,
 he's
 able
 to
 speak


to
 his
 parents
 when
 they
 call
 him
 and


then
 the
 call
 gets
 interrupted
 quite


quickly,
 but
 at
 least
 he
 he
 can
 hear


from
 them.
 We
 weren't
 actually
 sure
 for


quite
 some
 time
 whether
 the
 stock
 market


was
 working
 or
 not
 because
 of
 the


blackout
 because
 it
 was
 not
 possible
 to


even
 to
 read
 any
 news
 from
 the
 official


news
 agencies
 in
 Iran.


>> So
 everything
 was
 down
 including
 from


what
 I've
 read
 including
 even
 like
 the


internal
 um
 domestic
 like
 an
 internet


network
 in
 Iran
 that
 is
 uh
 that
 is
 very


controlled.
 This
 was
 this
 was
 also
 down.


Even
 ATM
 stopped
 working
 for
 a
 moment.


uh
 I
 think
 just
 like
 a
 one
 day
 brief


moment
 cash
 transfers
 were
 working
 bank


transfers
 apparently
 the
 local
 you
 know


Uber
 equivalent
 called
 snap
 was
 working


all
 the
 time
 however
 GPS
 was
 not
 working


properly
 so
 it
 was
 difficult
 to
 locate


the
 driver
 and
 so
 on
 so
 exactly
 what
 you


said
 it's
 it's
 it's
 difficult
 to


understand
 exactly
 what
 is
 going
 on


>> so
 this
 is
 of
 course
 Matcha
 Voit
 he
 is


the
 CEO
 of
 Amtalon
 Capital
 which
 is
 a


fund
 that
 specializes
 in
 Iranian


equities
 and
 there
 aren't
 that
 many
 of


those
 ground.


>> I
 don't
 even
 know
 if
 there's
 a
 second


one.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 we
 enjoy
 talking
 to
 him
 and
 he


has
 really
 good
 insights
 into
 what
 is


actually
 happening
 on
 the
 ground
 in


Iran.
 The
 first
 question
 I
 should
 ask


directly
 is,
 is
 your
 team
 okay?
 Are
 they


safe
 and
 well,
 the
 people
 that
 you


actually
 have
 in
 the
 country?


>> Thank
 you
 for
 asking
 about
 that,
 Tracy.


We
 have
 uh
 we
 have
 a
 local
 team
 in


Thran,
 part
 of
 which
 is
 actually
 in


London
 at
 the
 moment.
 Now,
 analysts
 who


are
 in
 Tehran,
 who
 were
 in
 Tehran,
 they


left
 Thran
 a
 few
 days
 ago
 when
 the


protests
 were
 getting
 more
 intense
 to


smaller
 cities
 to
 their
 hometowns.
 So,


the
 last
 time
 we've
 heard
 from
 them
 was


a
 couple
 of
 days
 ago.
 At
 that
 time,
 they


were
 they
 were
 in
 a
 safe
 place.
 So,
 I


believe
 they're
 they're
 all
 fine.


>> I
 mean,
 just
 your
 intuition,
 let's


actually
 set
 aside
 the
 question
 of
 like,


is
 this
 a
 moment
 where
 the
 regime
 would


get
 toppled
 or
 something
 like
 that,
 etc.


Does
 this
 feel
 either
 quantitatively
 or


qualitatively
 different
 from
 various


episodes
 over
 the
 last
 two
 decades
 in


which
 suddenly
 the
 internet
 is
 looking


at
 fairly
 blurry
 videos
 of
 Iranian


protesters
 and
 asking
 like
 does
 this


feel
 different
 somehow?


>> Yes,
 it
 definitely
 does.


>> Okay.
 So
 first
 of
 all
 obviously
 looking


at
 you
 know
 the
 history
 it
 teaches
 you


not
 to
 get
 excited
 or
 to
 I
 don't
 know


hopeful
 for
 any
 meaningful
 changes.


However
 it
 does
 feel
 different
 and
 maybe


maybe
 two
 things
 could
 be
 interesting


here.
 First
 of
 all
 as
 you
 said
 Joe
 at


the
 beginning
 it's
 it's
 not
 the
 first


protest
 it's
 you
 know
 another
 protest


over
 the
 years.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at


comparable
 situations
 for
 example
 Poland


Poland
 is
 always
 close
 uh
 to
 my
 heart.


I'm
 I'm
 Polish
 originally
 and
 Poland


when
 we
 were
 trying
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 the


Soviet
 Union
 it
 took
 9
 years
 and
 every


year
 there
 was
 a
 massive
 protest
 this


protest
 you
 know
 died
 and
 then
 uh
 you


know
 with
 very
 brutal
 reaction
 from
 from


the
 government.
 Then
 the
 next
 year
 there


was
 another
 protest.
 In
 the
 meantime


there
 was
 martial
 law
 with
 you
 know


military
 on
 the
 streets
 and
 so
 on.
 But


finally
 many
 things
 came
 together
 and


there
 was
 a
 tipping
 point
 at
 which


everything
 collapsed.
 Although
 it
 didn't


collapse
 actually
 it
 was
 it
 was
 a


negotiated
 transition
 to
 a
 different


regime.
 So
 you
 know
 the
 establishment


got
 a
 got
 an
 offramp
 to
 move
 on
 and
 it


was
 a
 peaceful
 negotiated
 transition.


Similar
 in
 South
 Africa
 based
 on
 what
 I


know
 I
 mean
 it
 was
 you
 know
 happening
 in


the
 80s
 and
 then
 in
 the
 '90s
 uh
 there


were
 actual
 changes
 in
 Iran.
 The


situation
 is
 different
 because
 for
 many


reasons
 demographics
 have
 changed.
 So


now
 you
 have
 uh
 I
 believe
 around
 93


million
 people
 out
 of
 which
 50
 million


is
 between
 you
 know
 15
 and
 49
 years
 old


like
 the
 active
 part
 of
 the
 population


and
 there
 are
 many
 more
 young
 people
 who


are
 educated
 who
 have
 you
 know
 access
 to


internet
 have
 their
 own
 aspirations
 and


they
 don't
 believe
 they
 can
 achieve


those
 aspirations
 in
 the
 current


environment
 and
 they
 also
 look
 at
 their


parents
 and
 they
 think
 that
 they
 just


wasted
 the
 whole
 generation,
 you
 know,


waiting
 and
 doing
 nothing.
 So,
 this


makes
 them
 more
 angry
 and
 also
 like
 more


decisive
 and
 confrontational.
 That's
 why


I
 think
 it's
 uh
 you
 know,
 the
 protests


were
 so
 intense
 and
 so
 widespread.


Another
 reason,
 another
 thing
 that's


changed
 is
 like
 you
 remember
 a
 few
 years


ago
 three
 uh
 2022
 uh
 there
 were
 in
 23


there
 were
 protests
 around
 social


freedoms
 after
 um
 an
 Iranian
 girl


Maramini
 died
 and
 this
 was
 driven
 by


basically
 by
 social
 freedoms
 and
 and


mainly
 involved
 young
 people.
 Right
 now


is
 driven
 by
 economic
 difficulties
 and


this
 is
 this
 touches
 every
 every
 single


household
 in
 Iran.
 Yeah,
 I
 wanted
 to
 ask


you
 about
 precisely
 this
 because
 the
 I


don't
 want
 to
 say
 the
 cause
 of
 the


recent
 unrest,
 but
 certainly
 one
 of
 the


sparks
 seems
 to
 have
 been
 a
 further


collapse
 in
 the
 currency,
 even
 higher


inflation.
 And
 wasn't
 there
 something


about
 a
 bank
 as
 well?
 Um,
 a
 bank
 that


was
 going
 bust
 um
 supposedly
 with
 ties


to
 the
 regime.
 How
 much
 did
 financial


stress
 play
 into
 the
 current
 round
 of


civil
 unrest?


>> Well,
 100%
 this
 was
 the
 main
 cause.


Look,
 the
 protest
 started
 on
 the
 Grand


Bazar
 in
 Tehran.
 So
 these
 uh
 bazaris,
 I


mean
 people
 who
 operate
 bazaars,
 they


many
 of
 them
 run
 like
 multi-million


dollar
 revenue
 companies
 there
 actually.


It's
 like
 this
 massive
 shopping
 mall


with
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 you
 know


smaller
 or
 bigger
 traders
 there
 and
 they


need
 stability
 to
 just
 you
 know
 do


business
 right.
 protesting
 revolution


like
 this
 is
 the
 last
 thing
 they
 would


think
 about
 but
 they
 are
 in
 a
 situation


you
 know
 where
 that
 many
 of
 them
 are


importers
 to
 import
 you
 need
 uh
 to
 be


able
 to
 obtain
 a
 hard
 currency
 to
 just


pay
 your
 supplier
 from
 Vietnam
 China


whoever
 it's
 it's
 impossible
 to
 obtain


to
 access
 hard
 currency
 or
 there's
 not


enough
 of
 it
 and
 that's
 obviously


because
 of
 sanctions
 because
 of


sanctions
 exports
 of
 Iran
 just
 went
 down


Iran
 is
 exporting
 oil
 only
 to
 China
 so


China's
 is
 dictating
 all
 the
 terms


including
 big
 discounts
 in
 the
 price


that
 they
 are
 paying
 but
 also
 the
 terms


of
 the
 payments.
 You
 know
 the
 China
 is


paying
 a
 big
 part
 of
 their
 payments
 are


in
 yuan
 and
 they
 and
 they
 arrive
 in
 bank


accounts
 in
 some
 Chinese
 banks.
 So
 Iran,


you
 know,
 the
 only
 thing
 Iran
 can
 do


with
 it
 is
 is
 to
 buy
 some
 Chinese
 goods


and
 and
 and
 what
 Iran
 needs
 is
 is
 to
 pay


for
 essential
 goods
 like,
 you
 know,
 some


food
 products
 or
 some
 medical
 products


that
 they
 need
 to
 import
 at
 at
 any
 cost.


And
 once
 they
 allocate
 all
 their
 hard


currency
 reserves
 to
 those
 essential


products,
 there
 is
 not
 much
 left
 for


other
 businesses.
 So
 this
 is
 one
 thing


that
 is
 difficult
 to
 run
 a
 business
 when


you
 cannot
 obtain
 currency,
 you
 have
 uh


you
 know
 inflation
 running
 wild.
 But
 on


the
 other
 hand,
 your
 consumers
 are


losing
 their
 purchasing
 power
 at
 an


extraordinary
 pace.
 So
 no
 one
 is
 buying


basically
 right.
 You
 have
 to
 spend
 on
 uh


you
 know
 eggs,
 milk
 and
 bread
 probably


you
 know
 more
 than
 10%
 of
 your
 average


uh
 monthly
 salary.
 So
 it
 looks
 it
 looks


really
 difficult
 on
 the
 economic
 side.


>> Can
 I
 ask
 very
 quickly
 do
 you
 have
 a


sense
 of
 what
 the
 current
 exchange
 rate


actually
 is?
 because
 you
 know
 this
 is


one
 of
 the
 few
 currencies
 in
 the
 world


that
 we
 cannot
 look
 up
 on
 a
 Bloomberg


terminal.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 around
 1.5
 million
 realale


per
 $1,
 which
 means
 it
 went
 down
 uh


around
 97
 98%
 over
 the
 last
 decade
 and


around
 almost
 50%


since
 before
 the
 war
 with
 Israel
 last


year.
 So
 over
 the
 last
 7
 months.
 So
 it's


really
 it's
 really
 falling
 fast.
 Oh,
 and


one
 more
 thing
 you
 asked
 about
 the
 bank.


Yes,
 actually
 there
 was
 a
 bank


collapsing
 in
 Iran
 just
 a
 few
 months


ago.
 I
 mean
 they
 formally
 recognized


that
 it
 should
 be
 nationalized
 and
 it's


extraordinary
 because
 the
 size
 of
 the


collapse
 it
 was
 so
 big
 that
 it
 actually


affected
 the
 budget
 of
 the
 country
 the


country
 budget
 for
 this
 year.
 So
 they


had
 to
 reduce
 subsidies
 and
 and
 just


change
 you
 know
 the
 expenditures
 of
 the


budget
 to
 make
 room
 for
 the
 amount
 that


they
 had
 to
 I
 think
 it
 was
 like
 $5


billion
 that
 they
 had
 to
 put
 into
 this


bank
 so
 that
 it
 doesn't
 you
 know


collapse.
 It
 was
 basically
 and
 it's


another
 it's
 another
 example
 that
 you


know
 makes
 people
 angry
 obviously


because
 it's
 it's
 it
 was
 a
 huge
 example


of
 corruption.
 So,
 you
 know,
 there
 was
 a


local
 well-connected
 entrepreneur
 who


was
 running
 a
 few
 construction
 companies


and
 it
 wasn't
 the
 case
 that,
 you
 know,


he
 called
 a
 few
 banks
 and
 asked
 for
 some


preferential
 loans.
 No,
 he
 set
 up
 a


bank,
 offered
 the
 highest
 interest
 rates


on
 the
 market.
 So,
 many
 people
 just
 put


their
 deposits
 into
 this
 bank
 and
 then


he
 was
 using
 those
 deposits
 to
 make


loans
 to
 his
 own
 companies.


>> I
 think
 it
 was
 like
 a
 majority
 of
 the


loans
 were
 to
 his
 own
 companies.
 He


built
 the
 biggest
 shopping
 mall
 in
 the


in
 the
 region,
 which
 was,
 you
 know,
 a


crazy
 idea
 from
 the
 beginning
 and
 many


things
 like
 this,
 right?
 So,
 another


example
 of
 thronism
 and
 corruption.


>> This
 is
 the
 shopping
 mall
 that's
 like
 as


big
 as
 the
 Pentagon
 or
 something.


>> Yeah.
 Twice
 as
 big.
 According
 I
 I
 read


the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 article,
 twice


as
 big
 as
 the
 Pentagon,
 this
 luxury


shopping
 mall
 in
 Iran
 suffering
 from


massive
 hyperinflation
 and
 all
 the


sorts.
 But
 I
 have
 to
 say
 starting
 your


own
 bank
 to
 then
 just
 fund
 your


construction
 company,
 a
 kind
 of
 a


brilliant
 idea.
 B,
 this
 is
 why
 bank


supervision
 and
 various
 things


>> is
 important


>> actually
 exist.


It's
 surreal
 to
 me
 this
 reality
 of
 here


is
 a
 country
 that
 right
 now
 is
 a
 de


facto
 information
 black
 hole.
 You


mentioned
 we
 don't
 know
 if
 the
 stock


market
 is
 trading.
 Here's
 a
 country
 on


earth
 and
 right
 now
 where
 we
 are
 in
 New


York
 or
 where
 you
 are
 in
 London,
 we


can't
 even
 answer
 the
 simple
 question,


is
 the
 stock
 market
 functioning
 right


now?


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 So
 all
 the
 stories
 that
 I


that
 I
 hear
 is
 that
 the
 way
 people
 were


able
 to
 communicate
 is
 because
 someone


had
 access
 to
 a
 Starlink
 operating
 in


Iran
 or
 someone's
 friend
 was
 working
 at


a
 hospital
 and
 hospital
 had
 some
 access


to
 either
 the
 wide
 internet
 or
 some
 of


these
 local
 networks.
 So
 that's
 why
 also


it's
 it's
 not
 possible
 for
 the
 country


to
 keep
 the
 blackout
 at
 this
 scale
 and


intensity
 for
 too
 long
 because
 you
 know


the
 whole
 economy
 stops
 right
 actually


the
 administration
 of
 the
 countries
 is


not
 possible
 right
 without
 uh
 without


internet
 so
 it's
 it
 was
 it
 was
 sharp


intense
 but
 it
 has
 to
 be
 shortterm


because
 otherwise
 you
 know
 the
 country


will
 will
 just
 stop.
 what
 happens
 to


your
 portfolio
 in
 this
 particular


scenario,
 your
 investments.


>> So,
 the
 stock
 market
 seems
 to
 have
 been


stable
 over
 the
 last
 week.
 I
 don't
 see


the
 exact
 numbers
 yet
 in
 terms
 of,
 for


example,
 liquidity.
 And
 I
 and
 I
 suspect


that,
 you
 know,
 there
 was
 not
 much
 going


on
 because
 I'm
 not
 sure
 if
 even
 local


investors
 had
 a
 chance
 to
 were
 able
 to


put
 orders
 online,
 right?
 Maybe
 maybe
 it


was
 old
 school,
 you
 know,
 calling
 your


broker
 or
 going
 to
 your
 broker.
 So,
 it


was
 stable.
 So,
 so,
 so
 nothing
 actually


actually
 it
 went
 up
 by
 4%
 and
 the


currency
 was
 stable
 too.
 The
 currency
 is


easier
 to
 to
 manipulate
 by
 by
 the


central
 bank
 using
 some
 reserves


especially
 when
 when
 there
 is
 low


liquidity.
 So,
 I
 think
 what
 will
 be
 more


interesting
 is
 the
 next
 few
 weeks.
 So,


for
 example,
 what
 happened
 last
 year


after
 the
 war
 when
 there
 was
 a
 war


between
 Iran
 and
 Israel
 in
 June,
 the


stock
 market
 was
 shut
 down
 for
 around


two
 weeks.
 After
 it
 reopened,
 the
 prices


didn't
 change
 much.
 But
 then
 local


investors,
 mainly
 retail
 investors,
 this


uh
 retail
 driven
 market
 started
 selling


because
 they
 didn't
 have
 access
 to
 their


funds.
 So
 they
 started
 selling
 at
 any


price
 just
 to
 get
 money
 out.
 And
 there


was
 a
 massive
 selling
 pressure
 that


lasted
 from
 July
 until
 September.
 And


when
 the
 buyers
 saw
 a
 selling
 pressure


like
 this,
 so
 every
 day
 you
 can
 see
 the


queue
 of
 unfilled
 orders
 building
 up


that
 will
 go
 to
 the
 next
 day
 and
 the


next
 day
 and
 the
 next
 day.
 So
 people


just
 stopped
 buying
 as
 well
 obviously.


So
 the
 market
 went
 down
 like
 uh


irrespective
 of
 you
 know
 which
 stocks,


what
 quality,
 what
 valuation
 or
 whatever


just
 a
 massive
 sell-off
 which
 lasted
 two


three
 months
 and
 then
 it
 rebounded.
 So


um
 it
 went
 down
 like
 in
 dollar
 terms


from
 let's
 say
 index
 of
 I
 don't
 know
 360


to
 230.
 Yes,
 if
 I'm
 if
 I'm
 looking
 at
 at


this
 correctly.
 So
 let's
 say
 36%
 in


dollar
 terms
 in
 just
 two
 and
 a
 half


months.
 The
 selling
 pressure
 then
 was


exhausted.
 All
 the
 selling
 all
 the
 sales


were
 were
 absorbed.
 valuations
 went
 down


to
 the
 one
 of
 the
 I
 think
 very
 close


levels
 to
 the
 like
 all-time
 lows
 in
 the


history
 of
 the
 of
 the
 Iranian
 stock


market
 which
 is
 around
 20
 years
 old.
 So,


you
 know,
 it's
 always
 cheap,
 right?
 But


this
 time
 it
 went,
 you
 know,
 below
 three


times
 uh
 net
 earnings
 a
 median
 median


for
 the
 market,
 right?
 So,
 you
 could


probably
 find
 stocks,
 you
 know,
 at
 two


times
 earnings.
 Then
 it
 rebounded,
 but


it's
 still
 around,
 you
 know,
 like
 three


and
 a
 half
 times
 earnings.
 So,


valuations
 are
 very
 much
 still
 driven
 by


war.
 So
 everything
 is
 priced
 for
 war,


right?
 So
 that's
 that's
 the
 sentiment


hasn't
 really
 recovered
 after
 the
 last


war
 and
 now
 we
 had
 protests.
 So


everything
 in
 Iran
 is
 priced
 for
 war


basically.


>> You
 know
 in
 the
 news
 obviously
 we
 hear


or
 I
 think
 we
 get
 a
 better
 grasp
 and


again
 I
 plead
 a
 lot
 of
 ignorance.
 This


not
 something
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of


familiarity
 with
 but
 what
 the
 protesters


want
 and
 you
 hear
 about
 young
 people
 and


wanting
 more
 freedoms.
 Can
 you
 give
 a


sort
 of
 I
 don't
 know
 political
 economy


breakdown
 of
 like
 you
 know
 you
 don't


hear
 about
 the
 people
 who
 obviously


don't
 want
 regime
 change
 generally


speaking
 they
 we
 don't
 know
 much
 about


them
 or
 who
 they
 are.
 Who
 are
 the
 sort


of
 different
 factions
 socioeconomically


that
 and
 how
 they
 allocate
 to
 either


side
 sort
 of
 I
 guess
 a
 a
 class


understanding
 of
 the
 tensions.
 M
 h
 so


there's
 a
 big
 group
 of
 young
 people
 and


young
 people
 want
 freedom
 and


opportunities
 and
 like
 fair
 rules
 in
 the


economy
 basically
 there
 are
 older
 people


adults
 in
 larger
 cities
 which
 are
 more


liberal
 definitely
 than
 tean
 is
 a
 big


city
 it's
 like
 12
 million
 people


altogether
 and
 life
 in
 Thran
 looks


different
 to
 most
 other
 cities
 in
 Iran


with
 you
 know
 women
 no
 longer
 wearing


hijab
 perhaps
 it's
 much
 more
 open.
 It's


much
 more
 liberal.
 But
 also
 there
 is
 a


big
 group
 of
 people
 who
 are
 very
 very


religious
 and
 they
 support
 the


government
 that
 is
 also
 um
 there
 is
 a


religious
 government.
 So
 they
 the
 the


concept
 of
 Islamic
 republic
 is
 very


close
 close
 to
 their
 heart
 and
 they


support
 it
 and
 and
 it's
 part
 of
 their


religion
 and
 part
 of
 their
 traditions.


uh
 so
 in
 terms
 of
 you
 know
 the
 how
 they


observe
 religious
 holidays
 uh
 uh
 you


know
 going
 to
 mosque
 uh
 dressing
 in
 a
 in


a
 certain
 way
 and
 so
 on
 and
 now
 how
 does


this
 split
 I
 would
 say
 that
 uh
 probably


between
 10
 and
 30%
 is
 the
 religious
 part


10
 like
 very
 religious
 and
 just


listening
 to
 the
 to
 the
 prayer
 and
 you


know
 whatever
 political
 advice
 comes


from
 the
 mosque
 and
 so
 on
 30%
 or
 let's


say
 a
 third
 of
 the
 society
 just
 being


religious
 and
 and
 supporting
 the
 um


Islamic
 Republic
 in
 the
 as
 as
 a


religious
 uh
 state.
 Just
 a
 small
 note


that
 it's
 an
 Islamic
 republic
 but
 very


tolerant
 of
 of
 other
 religions.
 I
 mean


all
 the
 churches
 work
 normally
 there


from
 um
 Jewish
 to
 Christian
 to


Zarustrian
 you
 know
 everyone
 is
 doing


his
 own
 thing
 in
 terms
 of
 religion
 in


Iran
 and
 it's
 and
 it's
 okay.
 So,
 and
 the


rest
 are
 people
 who
 want
 a
 modern
 open


state
 with
 the
 young
 including
 the
 young


people
 who
 want
 it
 fast
 basically
 and


and
 and
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 follow
 their


dreams
 and
 aspirations.
 So,
 so,
 so
 that


would
 be
 the
 breakdown.


>> So,
 I
 should
 just
 say
 we're
 recording


this
 on
 January
 15th.
 The
 headlines
 are


coming
 pretty
 fast
 nowadays.
 So,
 who


knows
 what
 will
 happen
 by
 the
 time
 we


publish
 this
 episode
 in
 just
 24
 hours
 or


so.
 But
 the
 latest
 headline
 is
 that


tensions
 seem
 to
 have
 eased
 a
 little
 bit


with
 the
 US
 because
 the
 Iranian


government
 said
 they're
 not
 going
 to


kill
 any
 more
 people
 or
 told
 Trump


they're
 not
 going
 to
 execute
 more


people.
 How
 should
 we
 interpret
 that?
 Is


this
 all
 over
 or
 do
 you
 expect
 uh
 some


unrest
 to
 continue?


>> Well,
 it's
 hard
 to
 predict.
 It's
 it's


it's
 very
 unpredictable.
 I
 mean
 unrest


is
 difficult
 to
 predict
 the
 dynamics


around
 the
 unrest.
 Then
 you
 know
 the


government
 of
 Iran
 is
 difficult
 to


predict
 but
 you
 know
 the
 government
 of


the
 US
 is
 difficult
 to
 predict
 because


you
 know
 right
 now
 yesterday
 today


yesterday
 you
 had
 news
 you
 had
 news
 that


President
 Trump
 was
 saying
 that
 yes
 he


got
 information
 that
 you
 know
 killing


stopped
 so
 this
 is
 what
 he
 was
 you
 know


what
 he
 wanted
 to
 achieve
 so
 it
 looks


better
 the
 day
 before
 everyone
 thought


that
 you
 know
 they
 are
 getting
 ready
 to


strike
 Iran
 so
 I
 think
 those
 things
 can


change
 in
 24
 hours
 so
 it's
 it's
 it's


just
 impossible
 to
 predict
 the
 Only


thing
 I
 would
 I
 would
 say
 is
 that


because
 it
 does
 feel
 different
 this
 time


the
 scale
 of
 the
 protests
 and
 the


reasons
 of
 the
 protest
 and
 also
 the


government
 just
 can't
 spend
 you
 know


their
 way
 out
 of
 the
 problem.
 It's
 it's


the
 the
 financial
 situation
 is
 really


tough
 but
 some
 changes
 are
 likely.
 I'm


not
 saying
 that
 within
 the
 next
 few
 days


or
 weeks
 maybe
 it
 will
 take
 months
 but
 I


think
 it's
 just
 moving
 this
 direction.


So
 there
 are
 some
 changes
 that
 are


likely
 and
 many
 scenarios
 are
 possible.


I
 mean
 look
 at
 Venezuela.
 There
 was
 no


regime
 change
 there,
 right?
 I
 mean
 there


was
 a
 like
 again
 negotiated
 solution


with
 you
 know
 Maduro
 taken
 out
 and
 and


the
 rest
 of
 the
 uh
 government
 and


establishment
 just
 in
 place
 but
 but
 they


have
 to
 cooperate
 right.
 So
 there's


probably
 more
 than
 one
 scenario
 possible


uh
 for
 the
 future.
 What
 a
 world
 we
 live


in
 where
 civil
 unrest
 is
 uh
 becoming
 a


major
 investment
 theme.
