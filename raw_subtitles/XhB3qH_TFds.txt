Today I'm chatting with Adam Brown, who is 
a founder and lead of the Blueshift team,  
which is cracking math and reasoning 
at Google DeepMind, and a theoretical  
physicist at Stanford. Adam, welcome.
Delighted to be here. Let's do this. 
Okay, we'll talk about AI in a second, but 
first, let's talk about physics. First question:  
What is going to be the ultimate fate of the 
universe, and how much confidence should we have? 
The ultimate fate is a really long time 
in the future, so you probably shouldn't  
be that confident about the answer to that 
question. In fact, our idea of the answer  
to what the ultimate fate is has changed a lot 
in the last hundred years. About 100 years ago,  
we thought that the universe was just static, 
wasn't growing or shrinking, was just sitting  
there statically. And then in the late 20s, Hubble 
and friends looked up at massive telescopes in  
the sky and noticed that distant galaxies were 
moving away from us and the universe is expanding. 
So that's like big telescope discovery number one. 
There was then a learned debate for many years  
about, you know, the universe is expanding, but is 
it expanding sufficiently slowly that it'll then  
recollapse in a big crunch, like a time reverse 
of the Big Bang, and that'll be super bad for us?  
Or is it going to keep expanding forever, but just 
sort of ever more slowly as gravity pulls it back,  
but it's fast enough that it keeps expanding?
And there was a big debate around this question,  
and it turns out the answer to that question is 
neither. Neither of them is correct. In possibly  
the worst day in human history, sometime 
in the 1990s, we discovered that in fact,  
not only is the universe expanding, it's 
expanding faster and faster and faster. 
It's what we call dark energy, or the cosmological 
constant. This is just a word for uncertainty.  
Is making the universe expand at an ever faster 
rate, accelerated expansion as the universe grows? 
So that's a radical change in our understanding 
of the fate of the universe, and if true,  
is super duper bad news. It's really bad news 
because the accelerated expansion of the universe  
is dragging away from us lots of distant galaxies. 
And we really want to use those galaxies. 
We have big plans to go and grab them and turn 
them into vacation destinations or computronium or  
in any other ways extract utility from them. And 
we can't, if the cosmological constant is really  
constant, if this picture is correct, because 
anything close enough, we can go out and grab it,  
obviously. But if it's further away than about 
a dozen billion light years, the expansion of  
the universe is dragging it away sufficiently 
rapidly that even if we send probes out at almost  
the speed of light, they will never make it.
They will never make it there and make it  
back. They'll never even make it there if it's 
sufficiently far away. And that means that there's  
a finite amount of free energy in our future.
And that's bad. I mean, that means we're doomed  
to a heat death if that's true. But is it true?
I mean, that was the second half of your question.  
And first of all, we keep changing our minds about 
these things over the last century or so. So on  
first principles grounds, you may be somewhat 
suspicious that we'll change our minds again. 
And none of this is settled physics. And 
indeed, it may be that the cosmological  
constant is not constant and you should 
hope with all your heart that it's not.  
It may be that it naturally bleeds away.
It may be, in fact, that our fate is in our  
hands and that our distant descendants will 
go and bleed the cosmological content away,  
will force it to go to zero. They will be 
strongly incentivized to do it if they can,  
because otherwise we're doomed to a heat death.
How would they bleed this away? 
This obviously depends on physics 
that we're not totally sure about yet,  
but it seems pretty consistent with the known 
laws of physics that the cosmological constant,  
what we perceive it as being a constant, this dark 
energy quantity that's pushing the universe apart  
from each other in many very natural extensions 
of the known laws of physics. That is something  
that we have the ability to change. In fact, 
it can change, can take different values. 
It is not just totally fixed once and for all that 
in fact, you have what's called different vacuum,  
different regions of parameter space 
that you can transition between,  
in which the cosmological constant can take 
different values. And if that's true, then,  
well, you can either sort of wait around and hope 
to get lucky, hope that the universe just sort of  
spontaneously moves from one of these vacuums to 
another one with a lower cosmological constant  
tending towards zero asymptotically, or you could 
take matters into your own hand, or you could  
imagine our descendants deciding that they're not 
going to just suffer the heat death, that they're  
going to try and trigger a vacuum decay event 
to get us from the vacuum we're in to another  
vacuum with a lower cosmological constant, and our 
distance descendants will be forced basically to  
do that if they don't want to suffer a heat death.
Yeah, Proceed with caution,  
but definitely proceed.
With caution in these theories  
where there's lots and lots of vacuums 
out there. And most of those vacuums  
are incredibly inhospitable to life as we know 
it. In fact, seemingly they're just completely  
inhospitable to all forms of intelligence.
So you really, really don't want to end up  
in them. However, again, if our best theories 
are correct, it seems as though there should be  
some of them that are much like our own in many 
ways, but have a lower value of the cosmological  
constant. And so what we'd want to do is 
engineer that we end up in one of those vacuums. 
Sorry, what is a vacuum?
Ah, great question. A vacuum is  
like a possible, well, what we would perceive as a 
possible set of laws of physics as we see them. So  
what it really is, is a minima in some 
higher dimensional abstract laws of physics,  
space in which you can find yourself in a minima.
But these minima may just be local minima. In  
fact, according to our understanding, the minima 
which we live today, that gives us all of the  
laws of physics that we see around us, is in fact 
just a local minimum. And there's a lower minimum. 
In fact, there's many lower minima out there 
to which we can transition spontaneously or  
because of our own deliberate action.
Okay, I'm just going to throw all my  
confusion at you and you figure out which 
one is worth dealing with first. What is  
the nature of the loss function that makes one 
value a minimum and one higher up? You know,  
what is exactly the ball rolling up on 
when it gets out or into a valley here? 
And then you're hinting at the possibility 
that there are other places in. I'm not sure  
if you're suggesting in the physical universe or 
in some hypothetical universe where the vacuum  
could be different, as in, in reality there 
are other pockets with different vacuums,  
or that hypothetically they could exist, or 
that our universe counterfactually could have  
been one of these? I don't know.
This is the kind of thing I'd like  
throw into. Put everything I can into a Claude 
prompt and see what comes out the other end. 
Good. Well, I'm happy to be your Claude. 
The loss function is the energy density,  
and so maybe a good analogy would be water.
Water can exist in many phases. It can be steam,  
it can be water, it can be ice. And even if 
it's in a cloud, let's say it would rather  
be water than be water vapor, but it's 
having a tough time getting there because  
in the middle there's a barrier.
And so, you know, spontaneously,  
it can eventually, due to a sort of 
thermal process, turn from steam into  
water. These will be like the two minima in this 
loss landscape. Or you can go and do cloud seeding  
to turn it from water vapor into water, and so 
those would be the equivalent of the minima here. 
The existence of different minima in general 
is a very well-established part of physics.  
The possibility that we could engineer 
going from one minimum to another in a  
controlled way is a more speculative branch 
of physics speculation, but it seems totally  
consistent with everything we know that our 
distant descendants would try to attempt it. 
What would it take to do this?
Probably you'd want something that would  
look a bit like a particle accelerator, but it 
would be considerably more controlled. You'd need  
a very controlled way to collapse a field and make 
a bubble of this new vacuum that was big enough  
that it would continue to expand, rather than 
just recollapse under its own surface tension. 
You would have to do that in a very careful way, 
both to make sure that you didn't accidentally  
make a black hole instead by the time 
you've concentrated all those energies,  
and also worse than making a black hole, would 
be ending up in a vacuum that you didn't want to  
end up in. It would be ending up in a vacuum in 
which you had not only bled off the cosmological  
constant in some way, but that you had changed, 
let's say, the electromagnetic constant or the  
strong nuclear force or any of these other 
forces, which would be seriously bad news. 
Because if you did that, your life, as 
you know it, is extremely well attuned  
to the value of the electromagnetic constant in 
your evolutionary environment. It will be very,  
very bad indeed if we changed those constants 
as well. We'd really just try and target the  
cosmological constant and nothing else, and 
that would require a lot of engineering prowess. 
So, it sounds like you're saying that 
changing the laws of physics is not even  
Dyson sphere level crazy. Somebody could do 
it on some planet in the middle of nowhere. 
I'd say it's definitely substantially harder 
than Dyson spheres as far as the tech tree goes,  
but it's not magic. We're not actually 
changing the laws of physics. We're just  
changing the low energy laws of physics 
as they present to us in this scenario. 
Again, this is speculative, but it's 
not super duper crazy. It's a natural  
consequence of our best theories, or at least 
some of our best theories of quantum gravity,  
that they allow for this possibility.
And there is a meta law of physics,  
the true laws of physics, be it string theory or 
whatever else, that you're not changing. That's  
just the rules of the game. What I'm describing 
is changing the way that the universe looks  
around you, changing the cosmological constant.
So I think again, changing water into water  
vapor into water is a great analogy here. There's 
nothing actually -- the laws of physics are still  
the laws of physics, but the way it feels to live 
in that universe, the value of the electromagnetic  
constant is perhaps not an absolute fixed 
value. It can vary in different places. 
Similarly, the density of water around you, 
the viscosity would change. It'll be an  
environmental variable like that.
One question you might have  
is if this is the thing that could, maybe 
spontaneous is the right way to describe it,  
if this is the thing that can just kind of happen, 
there's something really interesting where if a  
thing can happen, you kind of see examples of 
it happening before. Even with nuclear weapons,  
I don't remember the exact phrase, but wasn't 
it the case that early in Earth's history,  
when there was a higher fraction of 238 isotopes, 
that there were spontaneous nuclear explosions? 
There probably was spontaneous nuclear reactors. 
They've discovered a seam in Africa where it looks  
like there was a fission reaction that 
naturally happened. It didn't explode,  
but it did do the same thing that 
happens in our nuclear power plants. 
One way you can look at nukes is like, this 
thing just would not have been possible if  
some intelligent beings hadn't tried to make it 
happen. But something like this happened before  
because the laws of physics allow it. Is there any 
story you can tell here where this vacuum decay,  
maybe it takes a super intelligent 
species to coordinate to make it happen,  
but also because it is the thing that the laws 
of physics can manufacture or can allow for,  
it has happened before or is happening?
Yeah, absolutely. Almost certainly anything  
that humans can do can happen without humans. 
It's interesting to reflect on what aspects of  
human behavior nature has a tough time doing 
without us and what it just does on its own. 
For example, we make colder things in our 
laboratories than really exist naturally  
in the universe. But the universe certainly 
could make anything colder just by chance. 
Vacuum decay is something that if it is possible, 
will in our future definitely happen. That's just  
a feature of the world that eventually in 
our distant future, if it's possible at all,  
it will happen due to a quantum fluctuation.
Our descendants may not wish to wait around for  
a quantum fluctuation to happen. They may wish 
to take the fate into their own hands, since  
a quantum fluctuations can take exponentially 
long times to happen. And if they even happened,  
you'd end up in an unfavorable vacuum, not 
hospitable for life, rather than trying to steer  
the cosmological constant in a happy direction.
But they certainly can happen, and in our future,  
and indeed definitely will happen, 
if they're permitted. According to  
our understanding of quantum mechanics, if 
they're permitted, they must eventually happen. 
Furthermore, there are again speculative, 
but not wild theories of the early universe  
in which this happened in our past, in 
which we transitioned far, far in the past,  
maybe into what's called a bubble universe. So we 
started off in some other much higher vacuum long  
in the past. And then what we see as the Big 
Bang was in fact just a sort of local vacuum  
decay that then gave rise to our the bubble 
in which we live, everything we see around us. 
Who would be in a position to seed these bubbles?
Usually people are thinking that something just  
spontaneously happens, in the same way that rain 
spontaneously happens in a cloud, that somebody  
didn't go and seed it deliberately to make it 
happen. But you could more than free to speculate  
that somebody seeded it to make it happen as well.
How does this respect the conservation of energy? 
Energy, or the conservation of energy, is not 
conserved in general relativity. Energy is  
not conserved. It's conserved locally, 
at things you can do at a local level. 
But in an expanding universe, 
energy is not conserved globally.  
This is one of the big surprises.
That is not a speculative statement.  
That is a statement that goes all the way 
back to Einstein and general relativity:  
energy is simply not conserved at the global 
level. It's conserved at the local level. 
You can't do something in your lab that 
will generate free energy. But if you can  
participate in the expansion of the entire 
universe, then energy is not conserved. 
So if you were to spawn a bubble universe in 
your lab, you've theoretically created a lot  
more matter and energy. What would be the thing 
that offsets this or that makes this viable? 
Energy is conserved in a 
universe that's not expanding,  
a static universe. A universe that is expanding, 
energy is not conserved. It can just appear. 
General relativity is quite clear on that. General 
relativity, Einstein's theory of space and time,  
one of our most beautiful and best tested 
theories, is quite clear on that point. 
Energy is not conserved. To ask what happened 
to the energy, you can ask at a local level  
what happened to the energy density. But at a 
global level, energy is simply not conserved. 
Then do our future descendants have any 
constraints in terms of... Because earlier  
we were mentioning, as a catastrophe, we found 
out about the cosmological constant because it  
limits our cosmic horizon and thus limits the free 
energy that our descendants would have access to.  
But if you can just make entire universes...
Then this is a matter of extreme interest,  
I would say, to us. It won't be relevant 
for tens of billions of years, probably,  
because that's the timescale on which 
the cosmological constant operates. 
But if the cosmological constant is truly 
constant, and we've only known about it for  
25 years, and there are astronomical observations 
that seem to be in tension with that, but if it is  
truly constant, then there is a finite amount of 
free energy in our universe. If it's not constant,  
if we can manipulate it, or even if it naturally 
decays on its own, then there is the possibility  
of an unbounded amount of free energy in our 
future, and we would avoid a heat death scenario. 
The situation you mentioned earlier, 
where somebody seeded our universe,  
they've created a bunch of energy. That's 
related to them having something equivalent  
to a positive cosmological constant in there.
Yes. In any of these scenarios in which our  
universe is a bubble that formed in a sort 
of bigger, what's called a multiverse,  
or that's a loaded term, but a sort of larger 
universe in which our universe is just one bubble,  
the higher meta universe also has a cosmological 
constant, and it is higher than the value in  
our universe. That is the one sense in which 
there's some version of energy conservation:  
you can go down from high to low. It is 
considerably harder to go from low to high. 
So the idea is that you'd recursively 
have universes in which the bottommost  
one would immediately implode because 
of a negative cosmological constant,  
and the biggest one is exponentially increasing.
Correct. The rate at which the universe is  
exponentially increasing is set by the 
cosmological constant, in which the volume  
of the universe is exponentially increasing. 
So you can imagine a scenario in which there  
was a high cosmological constant.
You have a bubble universe that has  
a lower value of the cosmological 
constant. It continues to expand. 
You could make new bubble universes or new 
regions in that universe that have a lower  
cosmological constant, either naturally 
and spontaneously or due to action that  
we might take. And as long as that cosmological 
constant is non-negative, is zero or positive,  
that universe will not implode. If it goes 
negative, that universe will eventually implode. 
So you could imagine a cascade in which 
you go to lower and lower values of the  
cosmological constant. There are a lot 
of engineering details to be worked out,  
but what I'm describing is a scenario that is 
not inconsistent with the known laws of physics. 
How likely do you think this is?
If the laws of physics are as we believe  
them to be, and if we do not blow ourselves up in 
some other way, this is an issue that our distant  
descendants will eventually have to confront.
No, no, no. As in the whole, like,  
there's like other bubbles. Not about 
something our descendants might do,  
but the fact that the big bang was the result 
of a bubble within some other metastable state. 
That's a tricky question. But since 
you asked it, I'd say probably 50%. 
There's a lot we don't understand about any of 
these questions. They're all super speculative.  
It's an active area of research how to combine 
quantum mechanics and expanding universes. 
On the other hand, it seems pretty natural 
when you do combine quantum mechanics and  
gravity and try and fit them all together in a 
consistent picture. If universes can expand a lot,  
then at all, according to the gravitational 
theory, then quantum mechanics will naturally  
populate those bits that can expand a lot, and 
so you'll naturally end up with an expanding  
universe. So I would say probably in my heart, 
slightly higher than 50%, but I'm going to  
round it down to 50 out of epistemic humility.
It's funny because this is often the way people  
talk about their AI timelines of, like, really, 
I think it's like 2027, but if I'm taking the  
outside of you, I'm going to say 2030. Okay.
And is there any way, given our current  
understanding, of using bubble universes to do 
useful work for the people outside of it? So  
to do some computation within it or to get some 
sort of actual energy out of it for the people. 
Outside of the bubble? So the thing about these 
bubbles is that they tend to expand at the speed  
of light. So even if you start off outside, 
you're probably going to end up inside them  
in short order unless you run away very quickly.
So this isn't something that we make in the lab  
and then just remains in a box in the lab. 
And then we use use to do things. This would  
be something that we would do or maybe would just 
happen to us because of spontaneous vacuum decay  
and it would engulf all of our future light cone.
And so we wouldn't. It's not a it's not a box  
that you're using to do things. It's a new 
place that you live. You better hope that  
you've engineered the stuff so that that 
new place is still hospitable for life. 
So look, if it's the case that you can set up 
some apparatus, not now, but not in this room,  
but eventually, that if some individual wants 
to change the constants of nature, they can  
not only do this, but then the repercussions will 
extend literally as far as light can expand. You  
might have some hope that future civilizations, 
individuals or AIs have tons of freedom, so they  
can do all kinds of cool things. You can have your 
own galactic cluster over there, and if you want  
to go do whatever you want, right, go live your 
life, and there's going to be some libertarian  
utopia. But if you can literally destroy 
the universe, maybe it's a different story. 
That is a big negative externality, destroying 
your future light cone. And in a world with big  
negative externalities, libertarian fantasies 
can't really happen. It has pretty good big  
government governance implications, is that 
if it is possible for people just to wipe out  
their entire future light cone — not only 
themselves, but everybody else who wishes  
to participate in that future light cone 
— then we're going to need a government  
structure that prevents them from doing so.
The worst-case scenario is even worse than  
that. Not just that they could do it, but that 
they in some sense be incentivized to do it. You  
could imagine really adverse laws of physics 
in which maybe you could speculatively build  
some power plant that just really makes use of 
sitting on that edge of instability. And then  
each person individually might say, "Oh, I'm 
quite happy to bear one in a trillion chance  
that I wipe out the future light cone because 
I get so much benefit from this power plant." 
But obviously the negative externality 
means that people really shouldn't do  
that. So I hope the laws of physics don't 
turn out that way, otherwise, we're going to  
have to have some super-arching control.
I've done a couple of these interviews,  
and these end up being my favorite interviews, 
where a normal person who has just had grade  
school education can think, "Of course, I 
understand this, right?" Or if you've just seen  
enough YouTube videos about pop sci. Give you a 
concrete example. When I interviewed David Reich,  
the geneticist of ancient DNA, I feel 
like we have a sense that we understand  
the basics of how humans came to be.
What is the story of human evolution?  
And just like the episode revealed to me that 
the main questions you might have about how  
humans came to be — where did it happen? When 
did it happen? Who did it happen with? In fact,  
the last few decades of insights have 
totally revolutionized our understanding. 
We have the sense that we understand what 
basically cosmology implies, but this idea that,  
in fact, there's this underlying field which not 
only implies very interesting things about the  
distant past, about the Big Bang, but also what 
our future descendants, you know, what kinds of  
civilizations they'll be able to set up, both from 
a governance and a practical energy perspective,  
it totally changes your understanding.
It just keeps changing. Not just your idea,  
our idea, everybody's idea has changed a lot in 
my lifetime and may continue to change. In some  
sense, it's because you have the lever arm, 
the long lever arm of asking about the very,  
very distant future that makes even 
small uncertainties pan out to absolutely  
ginormous distances in the distant future.
I think earlier you said, "I wouldn't be  
that crazy." But also, "It's not as easy 
as a Dyson sphere." What are we talking  
about here? How much energy would it take to...
The energy requirements are probably pretty small,  
much more than we can currently make 
in our particle colliders, but much  
smaller just in terms of MC squared than the 
energy in your body. For example, the energy  
is not going to be the hard bit. The hard bit is 
going to be concentrating it together in a really  
small little bubble that's shaped exactly right in 
order that it doesn't form a black hole, expands  
in just the way that you want it to expand, 
and lands in the vacuum that you're aiming for. 
So it's more going to be a control 
issue than just a pure energy issue. 
But you think this is just table stakes for 
distant descendants who are colonizing the stars? 
It's not inconsistent with the known laws of 
physics, which means that it's just engineering. 
I feel like that the most sort of a churchy phrase 
physics can occur is "your proposition is not  
inconsistent with the known laws of physics."
Not this. 
If we lived in a world of intelligent design, 
and these were the laws we found ourselves with,  
at a high level, what is the creator trying 
to maximize? Other than maybe us existing,  
does there seem like something that is 
being optimized for? What's going on here? 
If you just throw a dart in laws of physics space, 
in some sense, you would not. There are some  
properties of our universe that would be somewhat 
surprising, including the fact that our life seems  
to be incredibly hospitable for complexity and 
interestingness and the possibility of intelligent  
life, which is an interesting fact. Everything 
is just tuned just so that chemistry is possible. 
Perhaps in most places you would throw the dart in 
possibility space, chemistry would be impossible.  
The universe as we look around us is incredibly 
rich. There's structure at the scale of viruses  
all the way to structure at the scale of galaxies.
There's interesting structure at all levels. This  
is a very interesting fact. Now, some people 
think that actually interesting structure is  
a very generic property, and if we threw a dart 
somewhere in possibility space, there would be  
interesting structure no matter where it hit.
Maybe it wouldn't look like ours, but there'd  
be some different structure. But really, if you 
look at the laws of physics, it does seem like  
they're very well attuned for life. So in your 
scenario where there's an intelligent creator,  
then they would probably be — you'd 
have to say they'd optimized for that. 
It's also the case that you can imagine 
explanations for why it's so well tuned for  
life that don't involve an intelligent creator.
Is there any explanation other than the  
anthropic principle for why we 
find ourselves in such a universe? 
Well, you suggested one with an intelligent 
creator, but the usual one that people like  
to talk about is the anthropic principle.
So is it 99% that basically the reason we  
find ourselves in a universe like 
this is the anthropic principle? 
What probability do you put high?
Well, what probability do you put on,  
anthropic principle is key to 
explaining why we find ourselves  
in the kind of universe we find ourselves in?
I think it's going to depend on what quantity  
you're asking me about. So if you ask me, you 
know, 99% of the matter in the solar system  
lives in the sun or on Jupiter, and yet we 
live seems to live in this really weird corner  
of the solar system, why is that? I'm pretty 
confident that the answer to that is anthropic. 
If we lived in the center 
of the sun, we'd be dead.  
And so one should expect intelligent life to live 
in this weird place in parameter space. So that's  
perhaps my most confident answer to that question.
Why do we live where we live? Then if we start  
talking about different constants of nature, we 
start getting different answers to that question.  
Why is the universe tuned such that the proton 
is just a tiny bit more stable than the neutron? 
That seems like that's begging for an anthropic 
answer. Of course, if that's true, that demands  
that there be different places somewhere in 
the multiverse where in fact the neutron is  
slightly heavier than the protons, decay to 
neutrons rather than vice versa, and people  
just don't live there. So if you want to go down 
that road, you end up being naturally drawn to the  
existence of these variables scanning over space.
Is there some way for the anthropic principle to  
exist that doesn't involve these bubble universes?
Yes, all you need is that there are different  
places in some larger possibility space where 
these quantities scan, where they take different  
values. Bubble universes are just one way to do 
that. We could just be different experiments,  
simulations in some meta-universe somewhere.
What part of this is the least logically  
inevitable? Some theories seem to have this 
feeling of like, "It had to be this way."  
And then some are just like, "Why are there 
these 16 fields and hundreds of particles?"  
What part of our understanding of physics?
I would say that there are three categories. There  
are things like quantum mechanics and general 
relativity that are not logically inevitable but  
do seem to be attractors in some sense. Then there 
are things like: the standard model has 20 fields,  
and it has a mass of the neutrino. Why do those 
masses of the neutrino have the values that they  
have? The standard model was just fine before 
we discovered that the neutrinos have mass in  
the 1990s. And those just seem to be totally 
out of nowhere. A famous Nobel Prize-winning  
physicist said about the muon, in fact, longer ago 
than that: "Who ordered that?" They just seem to  
be there but without any particular reason.
And then there are these quantities that are  
somewhere in the middle, that are not 
logically necessary but do seem to be  
necessary for life as we know it to exist.
How confident are we that these different  
properties of different universes would 
actually be inconsistent with intelligent life? 
That's a great question. This line of thought 
starts to be a skeptical response to the anthropic  
principle. An example that sometimes people use 
is a puddle that's sitting in some depression in  
the ground reflects on how wonderful the universe 
is, that this depression in the ground seemed to  
have been made the perfect shape for the puddle 
to exist. And our view would have said, "No,  
the reason the puddle has that shape is because 
it isn't self-adapted to the hole in the ground." 
Maybe no matter what the laws of physics, there 
would be something that emerged there. Certainly,  
if you go to the bottom of the sea, or in nuclear 
reactors, or in various other places, this kind  
of life will find a way. Philosophy seems to be 
adapted at least there, where it's very different  
from the surface of the Earth where we find 
ourselves. And yet they're able to be, certain  
life is able to live in undersea vents and is 
able to adapt itself to those environments. 
I think I basically buy that life is quite 
adaptable, but whether life is adaptable  
enough that a universe with a cosmological 
constant that ripped it apart every microsecond,  
that seems implausible to me. Or even closer 
to home, the center of the sun. It's not clear  
exactly whether we can get intelligent life 
living at the center of the sun, even though  
that has the same laws of physics as us. It 
just has a different environmental variable. 
What is the most underappreciated 
discovery in cosmology in our lifetime? 
In the 2000s and before, we very carefully 
studied the cosmic microwave background. This,  
what's sometimes called the echo of the 
Big Bang, and the inhomogeneity to it,  
the fact that it's not quite 
the same in every direction. 
Doing that discovered a super interesting fact 
that was definitely not known in my lifetime,  
which is the quantum origin of all of 
the structure we see in the universe.  
So if you look out in the universe, the density 
is not the same everywhere. The density on Earth  
is much more than in interplanetary space, which 
is itself much more than in intergalactic space,  
and the center of the sun is all the more 
denser. It is inhomogeneous; it is not the same. 
If you look back to the early universe, it was 
considerably more homogeneous. It was homogeneous  
to 1 part in 10^5 or 10^6. Almost everywhere, 
every point had almost exactly the same density. 
So then there's an easy part and a hard part. 
The easy part is understanding how if you have  
very small inhomogeneities, how they grow into 
large inhomogeneities. That's already quite well  
understood by classical physics. Basically, 
the idea is this: if you have a place that's  
denser and a place that's less dense, then 
the gravitational force pulls stuff towards  
the high-density stuff. So if you have a small 
inhomogeneity, they naturally grow under that  
effect where they just gravitationally fall 
towards the denser thing. If you start seeded  
with small inhomogeneities, that will grow large 
inhomogeneities, and that's well understood. 
The thing that we now understand much better than 
we did is where those small inhomogeneities come  
from. Why, just after the Big Bang, was 
the universe not perfectly homogeneous?  
Because if it was perfectly homogeneous, 
there's no opportunity for anything to grow. 
We now understand with a high degree of 
confidence something that we didn't understand,  
which is that those inhomogeneities were seeded 
by quantum fluctuations. When the universe,  
just after the Big Bang, was considerably smaller 
than it is today, the effects of quantum mechanics  
were correspondingly more important. Those 
quantum fluctuations produced tiny little  
fluctuations in the density of matter in 
the universe. And all of those tiny little  
one-part-in-a-million fluctuations grew into 
all of the structures you see in the universe:  
all the galaxies, you, me, everything else.
Is it a meaningful question to ask what  
level of structure each individual discrepancy 
corresponds to, each individual 1 in 10^5 part?  
Is it a galactic supercluster? Is it a galaxy?
It depends. We believe that these were generated  
during a period we call inflation, 
very poorly understood, very early in  
the universe. And there were fluctuations 
made not just at one scale in those days,  
but at all scales, or many, many scales.
There were fluctuations made at a scale  
that nowadays corresponds to 10% of the distance 
across the visible universe, all the way down to  
structures that were inhomogeneities that were 
much, much smaller scale that correspond to a  
galaxy today, all the way down to--now, this is 
speculation, but in some models of inflation,  
there were tiny inhomogeneities, very small-scale 
inhomogeneities that would give rise to primordial  
black holes, like tiny little black holes left 
over from the Big Bang. There's no actual evidence  
in terms of observational evidence, no strong 
observational evidence for those, but those  
are a possibility. That's allowed by our theory, 
and people think about them and look for them. 
What makes General Relativity so beautiful?
I think general relativity is really an  
extraordinary story. It's pretty unusual 
in the history of physics that you,  
to first approximation, just have one guy who sits 
down and thinks really, really hard with lots of  
thought experiments about jumping up and down 
in elevators and beetles moving on the surface  
of planets and all the rest of it, and at the end 
of that time writes down a theory that completely  
reconceptualizes nature's most familiar force and 
also speaks not just to that, but speaks to the  
origin and fate of the universe and almost 
immediately achieves decisive experimental  
confirmation in the orbits of astronomical 
observations or the orbits of planets and  
the deflections of lights during eclipses and 
stuff like that. It's a pretty beautiful theory,  
and it completely changed our idea of gravity 
from being a force to just being an artifact  
of the curvature of spacetime, actually.
So this is actually a good point to chat  
about your actual day job. So there's these 
open debates about the kind of reasoning  
that these LLMs do. Does it correspond to true 
reasoning, or is it something more procedural?  
And it sometimes gets into a definition game.
But this is maybe a good way to test our  
intuitions here. The kind of thing that Einstein 
was doing, where you start off with some thought  
experiments, you start off with some seeming 
conceptual inconsistencies in existing models,  
and you trace them through to some beautiful 
unified theory at the end, and you make incredibly  
productive use of these intuition pumps, that 
kind of reasoning. How far are our AIs from that? 
I have heard it said, and I kind of 
agree with this, that maybe the very  
last thing that these systems will be able 
to do, these LLMs will be able to do, is,  
given the laws of physics as we understood them 
at the turn of the last century, invent general  
relativity from that. So I think that's probably 
the terminal step. And then once it can do that,  
if it can do that, then there won't be much 
else to do as far as humans are concerned. 
It's pretty extraordinary, I mean, particularly 
coming from a physics background in which progress  
is pretty slow, to come to the AI field and see 
progress being so extraordinarily rapid day by  
day, week by week, year by year. Looking at it, 
it certainly looks like these LLMs and these AI  
systems in some sense are just interpolators, 
but the level of abstraction at which they're  
interpolating keeps going up and up and up and we 
keep sort of riding up that chain of abstractions.  
And then, presumably, from a sufficiently elevated 
point of view, the invention of general relativity  
from Newtonian physics is just interpolation at 
some sufficiently grandiose level of abstraction. 
That perhaps tells us something about the 
nature of intelligence, human intelligence,  
as well as about these large language models. If 
you ask me how many years until we can do that,  
that is not totally clear, but 
in some sense, general relativity  
was the greatest leap that humanity ever made. And 
once we can do that, perhaps in 10 years, then we  
will have fully encompassed human intelligence.
Will it be of the same character as what Einstein  
did? Clearly, there are many disanalogies between 
human intelligence in these large language models,  
but I think at the right level of 
abstraction, it may be the same. 
Do you see early examples of the kind of thing it 
was? Obviously not at that level of difficulty,  
but you just start off with, hey, here's something 
funny, go think about it for a while. Is there  
something especially impressive you see when you 
kind of run that kind of experiment at the moment? 
These systems tend to be doing more 
elementary material than that. They  
tend to be doing undergraduate-level 
material. Yes. I haven't seen anything  
that jumps out to me like inventing generative 
relativity or even a toy version of that. 
But there is, in some sense, creativity 
or interpolation required to answer any of  
these problems. Where you start with some science 
problem, you need to recognize that it's analogous  
to some other thing that you know, and then sort 
of combine them and then make a mathematical  
problem out of it and solve that problem.
Do you think AI mathematicians,  
AI physicists will have advantages over 
humans just because they can by default  
think in terms of weird dimensions and manifolds 
in a way that doesn't natively come to humans? 
Ah, you know, I think maybe we need to back up 
to in what sense the humans do or don't think  
natively in higher dimensions. Obviously, it's 
not our natural space. There was a technology  
that was invented to think about these things, 
which was, you know, notation, tensor notation,  
various other things that allows you to much using 
just even writing, as Einstein did 100 years ago,  
allows you to sort of naturally move between 
dimensions. And then you're thinking more about  
manipulating these mathematical objects than 
you are about thinking in higher dimensions. 
I don't think there's any sense, I mean, in which 
large language models naturally think in higher  
dimensions more than humans do. You could say, 
well, this large language models have billions of  
parameters. That's like a billion-dimensional 
space. But you could say the same about the  
human brain, that it has all of these billions of 
parameters and is therefore billion-dimensional. 
Whether that fact translates into thinking 
in billions of spatial dimensions,  
I don't really see that in the human. And I 
don't think that applies to an LLM either. 
Yeah, I guess you could imagine that if you were 
just seeing like a million different problems that  
rely on doing this weird tensor math, then in the 
same way that maybe even a human gets trained up  
through that to build better intuitions, the same 
thing would happen with AI. It just sees more  
problems. It can develop better representations 
of these kinds of weird geometries or something. 
I think that's certainly true, that it 
is definitely seeing more examples than  
any of us will ever see in our life. 
And it is perhaps going to build more  
sophisticated representations than we 
have. Often in the history of physics,  
a breakthrough is just how you think 
about it, what representation you do. 
It is sometimes jokingly said that Einstein's 
greatest contribution to physics was a certain  
notation he invented called the Einstein summation 
convention, which allowed you to more easily  
express and think about these things in a more 
compact way that strips away some of the other  
things. Penrose, one of his great contributions, 
was just inventing a new notation for thinking  
about some of these space times and how they 
work that made certain other things clear. 
So clearly coming up with the right representation 
has been an incredibly powerful tool in the  
history of physics and many incredibly large 
developments, somewhat analogous to coming up  
with a new experimental technique in some of 
the more applied scientific domains. And one  
would hope that as these large language models get 
better, they come up with better representations,  
at least better representations for them that may 
not be the same as a good representation for us. 
We'll be getting somewhere when you 
ask Gemini a question and it says, "Ah,  
good question. In order to better think about 
this, let me come up with this new notation." 
So we've been talking about what AI physicists 
could do. What could physicists with AI do? That  
is to say, are your physicist colleagues 
now starting to use LLMs? Are you yourself  
using LLMs to help you with your physics 
research? What are they especially good  
at? What are they especially bad at?
What physicists don't do, or don't  
productively do, is just say, "LLM, please 
quantize gravity for me. Go." That doesn't  
get you anywhere. But physicists are starting 
to use them in a big way, just not for that. 
More of an assistant rather than agent. Three 
years ago, they were totally useless. No value  
whatsoever in them. Low-hanging fruit uses include 
doing literature search. So if you just say,  
"I have this idea, what are some relevant 
papers?" They're great at that, and semantically  
greater than any other kind of search.
The other thing that they're extremely  
useful for now that they were useless for before 
is just as a tutor. There is a huge amount of  
physics that a physicist would be expected to 
know that has already been done. No human has  
ever read the whole literature or understands 
everything, or maybe there isn't even something  
that you feel you should understand, or you 
once understood that you don't understand. 
I think the very best thing in the world for 
that would be to phone up a colleague, if you  
knew exactly who to phone, they'd probably be able 
to answer your question the best. But certainly,  
if you just ask a large language model, you get 
great answers, probably better than all but the  
very best person you could phone. They know about 
a huge amount, they're non-judgmental, they will  
not only tell you what the right answer is, but 
debug your understanding on the wrong answer. 
So I think a lot of physics professors are 
using them just as personal tutors. And it  
fills a hole because there are personal... If 
you want to know how to do something basic,  
it's typically very well documented. If 
you want to know quite advanced topics,  
there are not often good resources for them.
Talking to these language models will often help  
you debug and understand your understanding. It'll 
explain to you not only what the right answer is,  
but what you thought was wrong. I think it'll be a 
pretty big deal, sort of analogous to the way that  
chess players today are much better even when 
they're playing across the board without the  
benefit of a computer, just having been 
able to be tutored by chess machines off  
the board. This is the same: you want to 
understand this thing about group theory,  
go and ask the machine and it'll explain it to 
you and it won't judge you while it's doing it. 
So there's an interesting question here. Clearly, 
these models know a lot, and that's evidenced by  
the fact that even professional physicists can ask 
and learn about fields that they're less familiar  
with. But doesn't this raise the question of... We 
think these things are smart and getting smarter. 
If a human that is reasonably smart had 
memorized basically every single field,  
and knew about the open problems, knew 
about the open problems in other fields  
and how they might connect to this field, knew 
about potential discrepancies and connections,  
what you might expect them to be able to do 
is not like Einstein-level conceptual leaps,  
but there are a lot of things where just 
like, "Hey, magnesium correlates with this  
kind of phenomenon of the brain. This kind of 
phenomenon correlates with headaches. Therefore,  
maybe magnesium supplements cure headaches." 
These kinds of basic connections... 
Does this suggest that LLMs are, 
as far as intelligence goes,  
even weaker than we might expect given the 
fact that, given their overwhelming advantages  
in terms of knowledge, they're not able to 
already translate that into new discoveries? 
Yes, they definitely have different strengths and 
weaknesses than humans. And obviously one of their  
strengths is that they have read way more than 
any human will ever read in their entire life. 
I think maybe again the analogy with chess 
programs is a good one here. They will often  
consider way more possible positions, Monte Carlo 
research, than any human chess player ever would.  
And yet, even at human-level strength, if you 
fix human-level strength, they're still doing  
way more search. So their ability to evaluate 
is maybe not quite as natural as a human. 
The same I think would be true of physics. 
If you had a human who had read as much  
and retained as much as they had, you 
might expect them to be even stronger. 
Do you remember what the last physics 
query that you asked an LLM was? 
Well, a recent one was I asked it to explain 
to me the use of squeezed light at LIGO,  
which is a topic that I always felt like I 
should understand, and then tried to explain  
it to somebody else and realized that I didn't 
understand it. And went and asked the LLM. 
That blew me away, that it was able to exactly 
explain to me why what I was thinking was  
incorrect. So, why do we use this particular 
form of quantum light in interferometers  
used to discover gravitational waves?
The reason that's a good topic is perhaps because  
it's an advanced topic, not many people know that, 
but it's not a super advanced topic. There are,  
out of a physics literature of millions of papers, 
there have got to be at least a thousand on that  
topic. If there was just a handful of papers on 
a topic, it's typically not that strong at it. 
Do you reckon that among those thousand papers is 
one that explains why the initial understanding or  
thought you had about it was wrong? Because if it 
just intuited that, that is actually quite like,  
that's pretty fucking cool.
I don't know the answer. That  
is an interesting question. I think it might be 
able to debug even without that. If you do much  
simpler things like give these language models 
code, it will successfully debug your code even  
though presumably no one has made that exact bug 
in your code before. This is at a higher level  
of abstraction than that, but it wouldn't surprise 
me if it's able to debug what you say in that way. 
It does falsify a lot of stories about them just 
being fuzzy search or whatever. Scott Aaronson  
recently posted about the fact that GPT-4 got a B 
or an A- on his intro to quantum computing class,  
which is definitely a higher grade than I 
got. And so I'm already below the waterline. 
But you teach a bunch of subjects, 
including general relativity at  
Stanford. I assume you've been querying these 
models with questions from these exams. How  
has their performance changed over time?
Yeah, I take an exam I gave years ago in  
my graduate general relativity class at 
Stanford and give it to these models,  
and it's pretty extraordinary. Three years ago, 
zero. A year ago, they were doing pretty well,  
maybe a weak student, but in the distribution. 
And now they essentially ace the test. 
In fact, I'm retiring that. That's just my own 
little private eval. It's not published anywhere,  
but I just give them this thing to follow along 
how they're doing, and it's pretty strong. 
They, you know, maybe it's easy by 
the standards of graduate courses,  
but it's a graduate course in general relativity, 
and they get pretty much everything right on the  
final exam. That's just in the last couple 
of months that these have been doing that. 
What is required to ace a test? Obviously, 
they probably have read about all the  
generality textbooks, but I assume to ace 
a test, you need something beyond that. Is  
there some way you'd characterize physics?
Physics problems, compared to math problems,  
tend to have two components. One is to sort 
of take this word question and turn it,  
using your physics knowledge, into a math 
question and then solve the math question.  
That tends to be the typical structure of these 
problems. So you need to be able to do both. 
The bit that maybe only LLMs can do, and wouldn't 
be so easy for other things, is step one of that:  
turning it into a math problem. I think 
if you ask them hard research problems,  
you certainly can come up with problems 
that they can't solve. That's for sure. 
But it's pretty noticeable, as we have tried 
to develop evaluations for these models,  
that as recently as a couple of years ago, 
certainly three years ago, you could just  
scrape from the internet any number of problems 
that are standard, totally standard high school  
math problems that they couldn't do. And now 
we need to hire PhDs in whatever field, and,  
you know, they come up with one great 
problem a day or something. The difficulty,  
as these LLMs have got stronger, the difficulty 
of evaluating their performance has increased. 
How much do they generalize from these difficult 
problems to not only that domain of physics but  
just generally becoming a better reasoner 
overall? If they just see a super hard GR  
problem, are they better at coding now?
Generally, you see positive transfer  
between domains. So if you make them 
better at one thing, they become  
better at another thing across all domains.
It is possible to make a model that is really,  
really, really good at one very particular thing 
that you care about. And then at some stage,  
there is some Pareto frontier and you 
start degrading performance on other  
metrics. But generally speaking, there's positive 
transfer between abilities across all domains. 
We've got these literally exabytes of data 
that we collected from satellites, telescopes,  
and other kinds of astronomical observations. 
Typically in AI, when you have lots of data  
and you have lots of compute, something 
something large model, great discoveries.  
Is there any hope of using these exabytes 
of astronomical data to do something cool? 
Yeah, great question. People are trying that. 
There's an effort, Shirley Ho and Flatiron,  
which is basically that exact plan.
They take the pipeline of all of  
the data that comes out of these astronomical 
observatories, they plug them into a transformer,  
and see what happens. You can come up with 
all sorts of reasons in advance why that  
might not be something that will work, but you 
could also come up with reasons in advance why  
large language models wouldn't work, and they 
do. So I'm very curious to see what happens. 
The dream there would be that there are lots of 
things hidden in the data that no human would  
ever be able to tease out. And that by doing 
this, you could just revolutionize the amount  
of... These astronomical observatories 
are incredibly expensive. If we can just  
have a computer better parse all of the data 
from them in a way that no human ever could,  
that would be a tremendous improvement.
These things are very good at finding patterns,  
and maybe they'll find patterns that are 
not particularly interesting to a human. 
Okay, so going on the GR thread again, maybe one 
advantage these models have is, obviously, you can  
run a lot of them in parallel, and they don't get 
fatigued or dazed. And you could imagine, again,  
naively, you would imagine some sort of setup. 
I assume you're doing much more sophisticated  
things, but naively, you could imagine a setup 
where, look, it seems like special relativity,  
which is something that maybe is easy to 
understand, is just like you start off with,  
let's just randomly select a couple of 
observations. Obviously, they were randomly  
selected, but you know, and let's just think about 
what's going on here for a while. Let's just do  
a bunch of chain of thought for a year or so.
And you could just imagine doing this and doing  
some sort of best of n across a thousand 
different randomly selected parts of the  
current model of the universe and just seeing 
at the end of it which one comes up with some  
especially productive line of thought.
Yeah, I think that could be productive.  
One challenge in that would be, how do you 
evaluate whether you had a good theory at  
the end? That's going to be the tricky bit.
For things that are most easily parallelized  
are things in which, if you get the right answer, 
it's clear you got the right answer. You know,  
perhaps things in NP, one might say. Whereas 
in this case, is special relativity... How  
would your computer know when, if it generated 
special relativity, that it was onto a winner? 
There are various ways in which it could know. 
It could check that it was mathematically  
self-consistent and various other facts. But the 
evaluation is going to be a tricky part of this  
pipeline that you might wish to set up.
Is there no experimental way that you  
could detect time dilation or something?
There is an experimental way that you could  
detect time dilation, but that would involve 
sending out probes or doing something in the  
real world. Whereas I thought you were 
just trying to run this in a data center. 
But now, today, we have these exabytes of 
information, so you could just have some  
sort of ability to search or query, 
like, I've come up with this theory. 
I think maybe this is a philosophical 
difference, where you maybe think that  
the way that a theory is good is that 
it best matches the data with some loss  
minimization. That's not always how new theories, 
particularly revolutionary theories, come up. 
There's this famous fact: even when they 
were moving from a geocentric worldview to  
a heliocentric worldview, it was so beautiful, 
the theory, by the time they were finished  
with the epicycles. I mean, not beautiful. It 
was so ornate by the time where these planets  
were moving around the sun but moving on 
epicycles, that actually the data didn't  
any better fit the heliocentric worldview 
than the geocentric worldview, especially  
since they didn't properly understand the 
ellipticity of the Earth's orbit around the sun. 
So it wasn't. Why does one theory replace 
another? One reason is obviously that it's  
more consistent with the data, but 
that's by no means the only theory. 
And if you just optimize for being consistent 
with the data, you're going to end up with—if  
you optimize only for being consistent with 
the data—you're going to end up with epicycles.  
You're not going to end up with some beautiful new 
conceptual thing. Part of the reason people like  
these new theories is that even though they're 
maybe not better at matching the data, they  
are more beautiful, and we'd have to teach—and 
that's been a reliable guide in the history of  
science—and we'd have to teach these LLMs beauty.
This actually raises an interesting question,  
which is, in some sense, we have the same problem 
with human scientists, right? And there's all  
these people who claim to have a new theory of 
everything. I guess there's not an easy verifier  
that everybody agrees to, because some people call 
them cranks, other people think they're geniuses.  
But somehow we've solved this problem, right?
Well, we've sort of solved it. We haven't solved  
it in the same way that, if you have some new sort 
algorithm that you claim is faster than everybody  
else's, a sort algorithm doesn't need to be any 
dispute about that. You can just run it and see. 
Physics is not the same way. It is definitely 
the case that there's a number of people who  
think they have great theories, and there 
are even perfectly respectable people who  
are professors at prestigious universities who 
have very different opinions about what is and  
isn't a worthwhile direction to be exploring. 
Eventually, you hope that this gets grounded  
in experiment and various other things.
But the distance between starting the  
research program and the community reaching 
consensus based on data and other considerations  
can be a long time. So, yeah, we definitely 
don't have a good verifier in physics. 
Even if we did someday get superhuman intelligence 
that could try to find all the remaining sort  
of high-level conceptual breakthroughs, how 
much more room is there for that? Basically,  
was it just like 50 years of "here's all the 
really advanced-grade physics," and now we  
just bog through additions to the Standard Model?
If you look at Nobel Prizes, year after year, they  
get less and less—at least in physics, they tend 
to get less and less significant. And in fact,  
this year, the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded 
to Hopfield and Hinton for their work in AI. So  
apparently, maybe a taste of things to come.
I don't think there's reason—I don't think  
we should be pessimistic about that. I think 
there could easily be room for completely new  
conceptualizations that change things. I don't 
think it's just turning the crank going forward. 
I think new ways to think about things 
have always been extremely powerful.  
Sometimes they're fundamental breakthroughs; 
sometimes they are breakthroughs in which you  
even take regular physics. This is a story 
to do with renormalization that maybe is a  
little too technical to get into, but there 
was a sort of amazing understanding in the  
1970s about the nature of theories that 
had been around for forever—or for years  
at that stage—that allowed us to sort of 
better understand and conceptualize them. 
So I think there's good reason to think that 
there's still room for new ideas and completely  
new ways of understanding the universe.
Do you have some hot take about why the  
current physics community hasn't—I mean, 
cosmology is maybe a very notable exception,  
where it does seem like the expected value of 
the light cone is switching back and forth. 
Well, if you take particle physics, I think it's 
because we were a victim of our own success,  
is that we wrote down theories in the 
1970s, and those theories were—it's  
called the Standard Model—and those theories 
were too good, in the sense that we won. 
In the sense that we could predict everything 
that would come out of a particle accelerator, and  
every particle accelerator that's ever been built, 
and every particle accelerator that's likely to be  
built given our current budgetary constraints. So 
particle physics—I mean, there were some questions  
around the edges, but this model that we wrote 
down in the '70s and into the '80s basically  
completely cleaned up that field.
We wish to build bigger,  
more powerful particle accelerators to find 
stuff that goes beyond that, but basically,  
we won, and that makes it difficult 
to immediately—if you get too good,  
then it's hard to know where to push from there. 
That's as far as particle physics is concerned. 
Is there some—so it sounds like the problem with 
these colliders is that the expected entropy is  
not that high of like—the reason it's not that 
useful is because we kind of have some sense  
of what we'd get on the other side. Is there some 
experimental apparatus that we should build where  
we, in fact, do have great uncertainty 
about what would happen, and so we would  
learn a lot by what the result ends up being?
Well, the problem with particle colliders is,  
in some sense, that they got too expensive. And 
CERN is tens of billions of dollars—a small number  
of tens of billions of dollars—to run this thing.
You could build AGI with that money, right? 
It's super interesting how everybody talks about 
how academics can't possibly compete with the  
big labs, but the cost of CERN is larger 
than the cost of big model training runs  
by a lot. So that's just academics pooling 
their money. That's an interesting fact. 
They got so expensive that it's difficult 
to persuade people to buy a new one for  
us that's even bigger. It's a very natural 
thing to do, to build an atom smasher that  
just smashes things together to higher energy. 
It's a very natural thing to see what comes out. 
People were perhaps somewhat disappointed with the 
output of the LHC, where it made the Higgs, which  
was great, and we found it, but we also expected 
it to be there. And it didn't make anything else,  
any of these more fanciful scenarios or anything 
basically unexpected. People had speculated  
we'd see supersymmetry there, or we'd see extra 
dimensions, and basically that was a null result. 
We didn't see anything like that. I would 
say we should definitely build another one  
if it was cheap to do so, and we should build 
another one once AGI has made us all so rich  
that it's cheap to do so. But it's not 
the obvious place to spend $50 billion  
if you had $50 billion to spend on science.
Often it's these smaller experiments that  
can look for things in unexpected places. A decade 
ago, there was BICEP, which is a reasonably cheap,  
tens of millions of dollars, experiment at the 
South Pole that thought it had seen some hints in  
the cosmic microwave background of gravitational 
waves. That would have been revolutionary if true. 
Not worth doing BICEP if it cost $10 
billion. Definitely worth doing BICEP  
if it costs $10 million. So there's all sorts 
of experiments like that, often observational. 
What is the value of seeing these 
primordial gravitational waves? 
Oh, it gives you hints. You're just examining 
the night sky very closely and seeing hints of  
what happened at the Big Bang. This is a sort of 
different approach to doing high energy physics. 
Why do you want to build a big collider? 
You want to build a big collider because  
the bigger the collider, the more high 
energy you can smash things together  
with. And Heisenberg's uncertainty principle 
says that high energy means short resolution. 
You can see things on very small scales. 
That's great, except the cost to build them,  
there's some scaling laws, and the scaling 
laws are not particularly friendly. 
There is another sort of approach that one might 
say, which is, you know, there was a ginormous  
explosion that happened, which was the Big Bang. 
If you imagine, if we look out in the universe,  
it's expanding. If you sort of play 
the tape backwards, it's contracting. 
Eventually it all contracts at 13.8 billion 
years ago in the Big Bang. And so that's a  
very big particle collider indeed. And so by 
just examining very closely the Big Bang and  
its aftermath, we're able to hopefully 
probe some of these quantities that are  
very difficult to probe with particle colliders.
The disadvantage is that you can't keep running  
it and adjust the parameters as you see fit. 
It's just like one thing that happened once,  
and now we're having to peer backwards with 
our telescopes to see what happened. But it  
can give us hints about things that would 
be inaccessible with any future collider. 
Is there any information about the distant 
past that is, in principle, inaccessible? 
Probably not in principle. Something happened to 
the universe in its evolution, which is that the  
very early universe, just after the Big Bang, 
was opaque to light. We can only see light past  
about 300,000 years after the putative Big Bang.
Before that, everything's so dense. It's like just  
a dense plasma that light just gets absorbed 
by. It's like trying to look through the sun. 
And so we cannot see directly anything 
from before 300,000 years. Nevertheless,  
we can infer lots of stuff that happened from 
before 300,000 years. In fact, looking at that  
light, what's called the cosmic microwave 
background that was emitted at that time,  
we infer lots of stuff about just due to the 
patterns of anisotropies that we see in the sky. 
We can infer a great deal about 
what was happening earlier.  
Most of our confidence about modern cosmology 
comes from a number of experiments that,  
starting in the '80s but accelerating in 
the 2000s, really very carefully measured  
that anisotropy and allowed us to infer stuff 
before that. At the information theoretic level,  
there's nothing inaccessible.
I guess that makes sense.  
Conservation of information. Maybe you 
will tell me that that also isn't true. 
Well, that's a great question. I mean, there's 
been a lot of debate in the black hole context  
about whether information is conserved by black 
holes, but the modern consensus is that it is. 
All right, Adam, what are 
your tips for hitchhiking? 
Oh, good question. So I hitchhiked a bunch around 
America and Europe. I've done Oxford to Morocco,  
when I moved from Princeton out to Stanford, 
I hitchhiked a bunch of other times,  
down to New Orleans, various other places.
I think probably the biggest tip for hitchhiking  
is to stand in a good place. Some counterparty 
modeling. Imagine the person who's picking you up. 
They need time to see you, to evaluate you and 
to decide they're going to pick you up and then  
to safely stop. And that all needs to happen. 
So stand somewhere where people can see you,  
possibly at a stoplight, and where there's 
a place for them to safely pull over. 
How do you model the motivations of people who 
pick you up? What are they getting out of this? 
I think it's different for different people. 
I think about 20% of people will just always  
pick up hitchhikers no matter what. Even if I 
was dressed very differently and presented very  
different, I think some people would 
just pick people up no matter what. 
I basically fall into that category now. 
It's hard coded into my brain that I will  
100% pick up hitchhikers always under all 
circumstances. Just because enough people  
have generously picked me up down the years that 
I just feel as though it's my duty and sort of  
not subject to a cost benefit analysis.
Just it's in there. Many other people  
are evaluating you and just trying 
to decide what you're in for. Some  
people are lonely and want somebody to talk to.
Some people have just a spirit of adventure and  
find it exciting to pick people up. Certainly 
it's not a representative cross section of  
people. I would say there's definitely 
a selection bias in who picks you up. 
They tend to be more open and more risk tolerant.
And what was your motivation for  
that? Were you just in need 
of a car or what was going on? 
No, I enjoy meeting people. I enjoy the 
experience of meeting people and the weird  
episodic sense of which, just, you never know 
what's going to happen. I think I have a very  
high tolerance for ambiguity, and I enjoy that.
What was the percentage of, "We just had a  
normal conversation, they went in the general 
direction I was going, and that was that," versus,  
"I've got a crazy story to tell about 
X incident"? What percentage is each? 
I think some people are just totally normal 
people. Families moving their child to college,  
and you get there and you help them move 
some stuff into the dorm room just to,  
just to thank you, all the way through to 
absolutely wild cases. Probably 20% are just like,  
this is one of the craziest things that 
ever happened in one way or another. 
Any particular examples of the wildest things?
Oh, yeah, huge. I mean, it's just  
absolutely a fire hose of wild things 
happening. I could tell so many stories. 
I remember once there was a trucker who picked me 
up in the desert outside Salt Lake City and who  
drove me to Battle Station, Nevada. And who, as 
we were talking—the truckers are always, in fact,  
the most interesting of all. It's typically 
illegal or anyway in violation of their  
employment contract for them to pick people up, 
so those guys are really, and it's always guys,  
are really pushing the envelope in terms of 
picking you up. The truckers often will say,  
"You're the first person I've had in my cab in 
20 years of trucking or something," and then  
they tell you about 20 years' worth of things 
that have been on their mind. So, I'd say that  
those are often the really interesting ones.
As I said, there was this one in Utah who just  
talked from the moment I got into the cab 
until we got to Nevada. I kind of got the  
feeling that he had sort of excess mental 
capacity and that this was his, you know,  
he was now just gonna dump it on me. And he was 
telling me all about his life, and I remember  
this very well, how his brother-in-law thought 
he was a loser, his sister's husband. But like,  
now he had the hot fiance, so who was the loser?
And then just sort of gradually over the course  
of the six hours, it just suddenly occurred 
to me that his fiance was doing advanced fee  
fraud on him. The whole thing was some 
ginormous, and he was being scammed by  
his fiance. And very unfortunately for them, 
they tried to execute the scam while he had me  
in the cab, and he never had anyone in his cab.
So now he had me in his cab, and they were trying  
to do some fraud on him. And I was able to, they 
had some wheat factory in Wales, United Kingdom,  
that they had some British High Court document 
saying that he was entitled to if he paid off  
the lien on it. There was some long, complicated 
story that was totally flagrantly false. 
I kind of felt like I had a moral obligation to 
him to break the news to him. On the other hand,  
we were in the middle of nowhere in Nevada, 
and it was clearly a very important part of  
his personality that this was so. So I kind of 
waited until we got close and said, is it possible  
that your fiance is being scammed by these people? 
You know, sort of raised the notion of scamming. 
And he was willing to intellectually entertain 
the possibility. And then we got a bit closer.  
Is it possible that you were yourself being 
scammed by your fiance? And then he was like,  
"No, no, no, it can't be." And he had all 
these documents to show that it was all legit,  
and they were just sort of, to somebody from a 
British legal background, transparent forgeries. 
He did eventually accept it and was just 
crying on my shoulder in some truck stop.  
It was quite a high pathos moment. And 
then said, uh, this happened before. 
And it turned out he'd previously been scammed 
in the same way or a similar way through somebody  
he'd met through the same match.com profile. 
That was his lucky profile because, you know,  
people kept messaging him through it. So we, you 
know, we talked through that and worked through  
that and, like, I felt in some ways I'd been 
his guardian angel and, uh, but he, you know,  
he'd also been my guardian angel and picked me 
up in the middle of the desert, so there was  
some, there was some great exchange there.
That's crazy. I hope he closed down that profile. 
I hope so. I mean, we, you know, I did 
chat to him about that possibility and  
he wasn't fully bought in on it, but, uh, yeah.
What's the longest you've been stranded somewhere? 
That would probably be one time in Richmond, 
Virginia, in some not particularly good  
neighborhood, trying to hitch out of 
there. I think that was about a day,  
which is really bad. That's really bad.
Sometimes, if you get a good spot,  
that's worth a thousand miles. Just don't, don't 
give it up just for a short hop anywhere. If you  
get a bad spot, get out of there on any means 
necessary because there's, because there's  
probably a thousand X variance in how high 
quality hitchhiking spots are, I would say. 
How did you find the time to like 
get stranded for a day at an end? 
In terms of intensity, it doesn't really take 
that much wall clock time, as we say. Coast to  
coast is, um, you know, like a week or so. It's 
pretty fast because you don't, you're not yourself  
driving, in that sense, it's easier.
You do have to wait, and, you know,  
there is definitely high variance how long you can 
be. But in terms of sort of incidents per minute,  
it's, it's a pretty good way to see the world. 
And you see such a cross section of people who  
I might never, never otherwise meet, and 
such a sort of high variance cross section. 
Everything from sort of idle millionaires cruising 
around the country looking for adventure to people  
who just got out of prison to, in one memorable 
incident, well, it eventually transpired as we  
were going along that they were, uh, they had, 
they were actually just teenagers and I didn't,  
somehow didn't clock that when getting in the car. 
And they, they had stolen the family car and were,  
were driving west, um, without a plan. And that, 
yeah, there I gave him a talk, I was talking to,  
and, uh, bought them dinner and some, some 
life advice. So that was some fun stuff I got. 
Did you make them call their parents?
I did make them call their parents, yes. Or,  
you know, heavily encouraged 
them to call their parents. 
Is there a luck to get the professor?
Yeah, none of these people typically realize that,  
uh, you know, your academic background never 
really comes up in conversation, typically. I  
mean, sometimes it does, but typically that's, 
that's not the nature of the conversations. 
Was there any time you felt particularly unsafe?
I have definitely felt more unsafe picking up  
hitchhikers than I have hitchhiking. Maybe I just 
got lucky, but picking up hitchhikers, there it  
tends to be, um, you know, no one really picks up 
hitchhikers, uh, anymore, and there's definitely a  
selection effect on who's hitchhiking.
Right. 
I've definitely felt more in risk of my 
life with hitchhikers I picked up than I  
ever did hitchhiking. But, you know, it's 
possible I just got lucky. You don't see  
the other branches of the wave function.
What are the other interesting insights  
from just getting this random cross section?
Yeah, all sorts of facts. A lot of people  
just like to talk. There's a lot 
of, a lot of people out there, and  
I like to talk too, so it's mutually beneficial.
Well, the truckers, I imagine are especially so. 
Those guys are interesting. They're all cheating 
their logs. They have certain logs about how long  
they can travel for, and at least every single 
one who's ever picked me up has all been,  
in some way or another, gaming the system of 
their logs about how long they're allowed to  
drive for and playing games with time zones.
They're smart people, and they just have a  
lot to say and don't really have anybody 
to say it to. So they're very grateful. 
What are they especially insightful about?
They tend to have listened to a huge number  
of audiobooks. They have a ginormous amount of 
information stored in their brain, but nobody  
to tell it to. Also, many of them tend to have had 
unlucky romances at some stage in their past that  
they've never really gotten over or spoken to.
I really feel as though many of them would do  
well to speak to a therapist. But 
you are the therapist in that case.  
In many ways, people will tell you things.
Frequently people will say things like, "I've  
never told anybody else this in my life before." 
That's common, not just the truckers, other  
people as well. Sometimes it's families picking 
you up, and so they're not going to say that. 
Often it's just single people picking you up, 
and they'll say, "I've never said this before  
to anyone else in my life." And they'll tell 
you some story of their life. I do think it's  
an exchange, and they're also getting 
quite a lot out of the conversation. 
I remember one case going to New Orleans. 
Somebody just meant to only take us,  
I think it was just some state trooper had 
come along in South Carolina and was going  
to arrest us because it's illegal in some 
states to hitchhike in North Carolina. And  
so I was like, "Okay, just take the next ride."
And it was just 10 miles down the road. He ended  
up getting so into it that we ended up driving 
maybe 1,000 miles out of his way by the time  
we'd gone. He'd had this, we were having great 
conversations, just absolutely wonderful time,  
and he just wanted to keep going and 
going and drive us through the night. 
Then we ended up going through the Deep 
South in the middle of the night and  
arriving near New Orleans around dawn. He'd 
had a father who had been in the military,  
but he'd kind of had a difficult relationship 
with. He ended up going and visiting his father's  
grave in Baton Rouge, never having done 
that in the 20 years since his father died. 
But just as this sort of turned, I mean, he 
just was driving along expecting to go home,  
and then it just turned into this sort of 
spiritual quest for him. Stuff like that can be  
pretty gratifying. It's also sort of cheating.
You're not, in my way of thinking about it,  
meant to be taking people out of their way. 
They're meant to be going where they're going,  
and you go with them, and they take you no 
further. But in this case, I think he needed  
to go there, so that was good for him.
Did you stay in contact with any  
of the people you hitchhiked with?
Typically, no. I would almost consider  
it poor form to do so. But actually, there was 
one lady who came to stay in New York later. 
She was going down to Haiti to sort of 
be a doctor there. She was a doctor,  
and so I stayed in contact with her a bit. But 
typically it's just the nature of the interaction  
is that you have this sort of beautiful 
moment in time together, and then that's it. 
Any other tips that somebody should know? 
I mean, should they do this anymore,  
given that it's largely uncommon and so 
uncommon types of people might pick you up? 
I think it used to be very common in the United 
States. It's still reasonably common in Europe.  
It used to be very common in the United States, 
and then there were some mass murderers who drove  
the popularity down by targeting hitchhikers.
Maybe this is just pure cope. In my mind,  
you need to worry about that less because if 
you are a mass murderer, it's really not a high  
expected value strategy to cruise around looking 
for hitchhikers since there are so few of them.  
But that just might be pure cope in my head.
I've never refused a ride for safety grounds,  
but I would, I hope I would if necessary. 
Sometimes you would refuse a ride because somebody  
is only going a short distance, and you're in a 
good hitchhiking spot. It's kind of bad karma to  
refuse a ride, but sometimes you should do that.
Other tips: don't write your exact destination  
on your sign. Write the sort of direction in 
which you're going. The reason is maybe twofold. 
One, a lot of people, if they're heading towards 
that place but not going to that place, will not  
stop because they think, "Oh, I'm not going to 
wherever it is, I better not. I'm not going there,  
so I won't pick you up," even though you'd 
very much appreciate a partial ride there.  
The other reason is if you do want to decline 
a ride, it's certainly a lot easier to do so. 
If the person says, "Oh, I'm going to that city."
Right, that's hard. Where if they say they go into  
that city and you've written something more vague 
on your sign, then it's maybe easier to decline a  
ride. If you want to get out of the car, the 
classic, if you get in and you feel unsafe,  
is to say that you're carsick because even 
serial killers don't want vomit in their car. 
So that's a good reason to get out, and then you 
just say, "Okay, I'll just stay here." That's  
another trick. I've never had to deploy that.
Oh, I was just about to ask. 
No, I've never had to deploy that. Typically, 
it's pretty, there's a moment of anxiety in the  
first minute. But then after a minute, it's clear 
that everybody is, they're also anxious about you. 
In many ways, you can tell that they're quite 
nervous about you. And then after a minute,  
it's clear that everybody's, 
if not a sensible human being,  
then at least a safe human being. And everything's 
super relaxed for the rest of the ride, typically. 
Any other strange people who 
picked you up that come to mind?  
Not necessarily strange, but just memorable.
So many different kinds of people. I remember  
there was one seemingly very successful 
cowboy, driving some fancy truck in  
Wyoming. He had a big herd of cattle and all 
the rest of it, and was asking me what I do. 
At that time, I was doing cosmology, so I 
tried to explain to him. It had no connection  
with anything. He just didn't understand 
a word I was saying all the way through. 
Eventually, we landed on the fact that the stars 
in the sky are just like the sun, only much  
further away. This was a fact that, in his life 
up to that stage, he had just never encountered. 
That was extremely gratifying because he 
was blown away by that fact. He wasn't  
intellectually incapable of understanding it. 
He just never, in his 50 years of existence  
up to that moment, ever heard that fact.
His mind was just totally racing. This was  
reorienting his picture of his place in 
the universe. "The universe must be so  
big if there are stars out there!"
He phoned his wife, who I think was  
somewhat less excited, and then took me to a 
gun store and bought me lunch. He was a rancher,  
seemingly a very successful rancher based 
on everything about him. He had some prize,  
high-quality bulls that were some rare 
kind of high-quality bulls. I can't exactly  
remember the details, but he just never really 
contemplated what the night sky meant for him. 
There's a Sherlock Holmes story where Holmes 
learns that actually the sun is the center  
of the solar system.
Oh, interesting. 
Watson tells him this, and Holmes is like, "Why 
did you tell me this? I try to reserve mental  
space for things that are actually relevant 
to my work. Now I have to forget this." 
A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
What did you learn from studying the  
first-hand accounts of the Nagasaki bombers?
During the pandemic, my landlord had a big  
library, and I just started reading some books 
in the library during deep lockdown. There was  
some sort of enigmatic statement in 
some book about the history of Japan. 
Where do you stay that your 
landlord has a library? 
I live in a house that used to belong to the 
chair of the English department at Stanford,  
and then it was inherited by his grandson who 
rents it to me. He has a very extensive library. 
I was going through it during the first lockdown 
and came across this super enigmatic statement  
in a book about the history of Japan. I was 
super fascinated by it and started, for reasons  
that I'll explain in a moment, then just became 
obsessed for a few months on reading absolutely  
everything I could about the bombing of Nagasaki.
It's the most recent nuclear weapon ever to be  
set off during wartime. It was reasonably 
controversial because people questioned  
whether we should have done it or not. That 
wasn't the question I was looking at. The  
question I was looking at wasn't, "Should 
they have ordered it to be done?" but, "Were  
the people who did it even following orders?"
It's a pretty wild story that I certainly didn't  
know before any of this happened. It was never 
meant to be a mission to Nagasaki. It was meant to  
be a mission to bomb Kokura, a different Japanese 
city, but they got there, and it was clouded over. 
They had very strict instructions: 
"Do not bomb unless you can see the  
target." That was the order.
They got to this other city,  
passed over a bunch of times, and they couldn't 
see the target because it was covered in clouds.  
Then they went to their secondary target, 
Nagasaki, and it was again covered in clouds,  
and they did a whole bunch of passes.
They'd made various mess-ups beforehand,  
including getting lost. They'd made a number 
of personal flying mistakes on their part  
that meant that they didn't have enough 
fuel once they got to Nagasaki to carry  
the bomb back to base. They probably would 
have ended up in the ocean had they tried. 
They were extremely motivated at the time. This 
was the only nuclear weapon that existed in the  
world. We'd had two, and then it went down to 
one. Now there was one, and they were just about  
to drop it in the ocean and lose it.
According to the official account,  
after having done all this, on the third and final 
pass over Nagasaki, there was a miraculous hole  
in the cloud that suddenly opened up, and then 
they dropped it. That story is a bit suspect,  
if for no other reason than that they actually 
missed. Little-known fact, they missed Nagasaki. 
They were aiming for one point, and they hit 
another point that was on the other side of  
the hill, such that the original thing they were 
aiming for was reasonably untouched by comparison,  
considering the fact that a nuclear weapon had 
been dropped. They missed by much more than you  
would miss if you were doing visual bombing, 
and they had been told to do visual bombing. 
There's this kind of suspicion that they were 
doing a little bit of radar bombing against direct  
orders. So is it possible that 50% of all of 
the nuclear weapons ever dropped in combat were,  
in fact, dropped against direct orders? If true, 
that's a pretty striking fact about nuclear war,  
since people are somewhat worried with 
nuclear war that someone will launch  
nuclear weapons without being ordered to do so.
It does kind of look like 50% of all the nuclear  
weapons ever dropped in combat were dropped 
against direct orders. When they got back,  
Curtis LeMay was going to court-martial them 
and was super mad, but then the war ended,  
and they didn't want to do it for PR reasons.
I just ordered and found every account ever  
written by every person. It was super fascinating 
to do that because all these different people  
had completely non-overlapping lives. Some 
of them were on the Manhattan Project and  
were there as observers and later won Nobel 
Prizes for physics. Some of them were just  
people who were just there for one moment.
So Louis Alvarez was on the plane? 
There was typically a physicist, a 
representative of the Manhattan Project,  
on the plane just in case. So Louis Alvarez was 
someone there. He actually wasn't on the Nagasaki  
mission. He was on the Hiroshima mission.
But in his biography, he's like, "They said  
they saw a hole in the clouds. I don't think I 
believed them." So that was, I think, one of the  
hints. It was maybe reading his autobiography 
at some stage, that was one of the big hints. 
The other people insist there was. But what's 
super clear is that, whether or not there was  
a hole in the clouds, and probably there 
was a hole in the clouds, just because of  
some of the technical things to do with their 
discussion, though it's definitely not obvious. 
What's clear is that whether or not there was a 
hole in the clouds, they certainly had decided  
in the cockpit on that final run that, no matter 
what, they were going to drop it. So even if there  
wasn't a hole in the clouds, they had decided to 
drop the nuclear weapons against direct orders. 
And had they written, basically, "Oh, we 
totally saw a hole in the clouds, but even  
if we hadn't, we would have dropped it."
That basically is. Yeah. So different  
people write different things.
How did you end up on the plane? 
There are about ten people on these planes. 
Did any of them say? Not all of them were,  
you know, some of them were some ways away 
from where the action is happening. There's  
the bombardier who says that he saw a hole in 
the clouds. There's the pilot who says something. 
But everyone has their own different perspective, 
and some of the perspectives are just totally,  
this is something that I guess I'd always 
been told by my history teachers but never  
really appreciated until I'd done this 
360-degree view of history, that people can  
describe the same events and just, they have 
flatly inconsistent memories of each other. 
Nobody who was on the plane said that 
they faked the hole in the cloud story,  
but some people who were on the plane said they 
were determined to drop the bomb no matter what,  
and they were highly incentivized to do 
this, because if had they not done it,  
they'd have probably, as it was, they only barely 
made it back to their emergency landing spot in  
Okinawa. They would have definitely ended up 
in the drink, and certainly the bomb would  
have ended up in the drink had they not done it.
So I don't know. I'm not a professional historian,  
and maybe there'll be a difference 
of opinions, but it's clear there was  
something highly sus about at least 50% of 
all the nuclear weapons dropped in combat. 
The interesting thing is that the reason nuclear 
war was averted in other cases is also because  
they refused to follow direct orders, right? 
So in this case, or in the case of Petrov, he  
didn't report the seeming sighting of Nuke Storm 
America, and that obviously contradicts orders. 
Yeah, there's nuclear 
insubordination in both directions. 
That's right.
There's the good kind, where they maybe  
should drop the bomb according to their orders 
and refuse to, and then there's the other kind. 
I also want to ask, so you've had not only one 
remarkable career but two remarkable careers.  
In physics, you're a close collaborator of people 
like Leonard Susskind, and you've done all this  
interesting research. Now you're helping do the 
reasoning work that Google DeepMind's working  
on in AI. Is there some chronology you have in 
your head about how your career has transpired? 
Oh, I don't impose narratives on 
it like that. It's certainly a  
very big contrast between doing physics 
and writing retail papers, as it were. 
Retail.
Doing one-by-one writing  
physics papers and then doing AI, which moves just 
tremendously faster, and trying to contribute to  
wholesale production of knowledge in that way.
They have very different impacts in terms of  
counterfactual impact. In physics, you write some 
papers, and you're like, had I not written that  
paper, no one would have written that paper for 
years or ever, perhaps. Computer science doesn't  
feel like that. It feels like if you didn't do it, 
someone else would do it pretty soon thereafter.  
On the other hand, the impact, even a few days of 
impact in computer science, these things are going  
to change the world, hopefully for the better, to 
such a large degree that that's much bigger than  
potentially all the physics papers you ever wrote.
That's interesting you say that about,  
you feel that physicists are not fungible in 
the same way. The story about why physics has  
slowed down is usually that, in fact, there isn't 
any low-hanging fruit. The idea that you would  
discover something that somebody wouldn't have 
written about for many years to come. I had a  
couple of double negatives there, but basically, 
we found all the things that you can just write  
a paper about. You're not just going to think 
about something and find something that somebody  
else wouldn't have written about otherwise.
But here, you're saying the field that's moving  
way faster, which is computer science, that's 
the one where all these people are going to  
come up with your algorithms if you hadn't come 
up with them yourself. And it's physics where if  
you had more Leonard Susskinds and Adam Browns, 
you would have much faster progress, potentially. 
Well, partly there's just so many more people 
working on the problems in computer science than  
there are in physics. Just the number of people 
is part of what makes the counterfactual impact. 
How many theoretical physicists are there versus 
how many people are working on AI research? 
AI research around the world? I don't know 
how many people are in research, but it's like  
thousands and thousands and thousands. 
The amount of matter is 100, 200, 300. 
Really?
Well,  
in the narrow domain of high-energy theoretical 
physics. There are many more physicists than  
that if you include people more generally, but 
they're sufficiently specialized. I mean, that's  
partly part of the reason is that it's a much more 
specialized field. So in a very specialized field,  
the number of people who would actually 
write that paper is a much smaller number. 
How much do you ascribe the slowness of 
physics to these kinds of things that are  
just intrinsic to any field that is as 
specialized and as mature versus to any  
particular dysfunctions of physics as a field?
Yeah, we look back on the golden era of physics  
from the 1900 through 1970s or something as a 
period when things happened. I do think there is a  
low-hanging fruit aspect to it. We already talked 
about how the Standard Model is so successful in  
terms of particle colliders that it's just hard 
to make rapid progress thereafter. So I don't  
really see it as a dysfunction of the field 
so much as being a victim of our own success. 
Having said that, does physics have fads? Does 
physics have fashions? Does physics have any  
of these other things? Absolutely, it does. 
But quite how much counterfactual progress  
we'd make if that weren't true, I don't know.
How well-calibrated are the best physicists? 
It doesn't necessarily pay to be well-calibrated, 
and that incentive structure is perhaps reflected  
in the poor calibration of many of the best 
physicists. First of all, because physics is  
a sufficiently mature field, all the good ideas 
that look like good ideas have already been had,  
or many of them. Where we're at now is 
the good ideas that look like bad ideas. 
So in order to motivate yourself to get over 
the hump, get over the barrier, and actually  
explore them, you need a little bit of irrational 
optimism to ride out the initial discouraging  
things that you'll discover as you go along.
I would say that typically theoretical physicists  
are not particularly well-calibrated and tend 
to be in love with all their own theories and  
make highly confident predictions about their own 
theories. Before the LHC turned on, there were  
certainly a lot of high-energy theorists making 
extremely confident predictions about what we'd  
see at the LHC, and it was typically their own 
favorite particle that we'd see. While I'd love  
to have found supersymmetry, it would have, in 
some sense, felt somewhat unjust to reward the  
hubris of people making overconfident 
and poorly calibrated predictions. So,  
yeah, that's definitely a thing that happens.
But I wonder if poor calibration on the individual  
level is somehow optimal on the collective level.
I think that's basically right. The same is kind  
of true in other domains of life as well. Of 
course, with startups, if you were properly  
calibrated about how likely your startup 
is to succeed, maybe you wouldn't do it. 
But it's good for the ecosystem that certain 
people are willing to give it a go. I think  
it's good for the ecosystem and perhaps bad 
for the individual to be well-calibrated. 
Another topic I know you studied a lot 
is how one might mine a black hole. 
Oh yeah, right. I read a 
paper about that. Very good. 
Tell me about it.
Okay, so what do we mean  
by "mine a black hole?" Mining a black hole means 
taking energy out of a black hole that used to be  
in a black hole. Obviously, if our distant 
descendants have used up all of the energy  
in stars and everything else, the black hole 
might be the last thing they turn their eye to. 
Can you get energy out of black holes 
at all? The old story, pre-1970s,  
is no. A black hole is one way: matter 
falls in, it never comes out, it's stuck. 
The thing that Hawking and Bekenstein discovered 
in the 70s is that once quantum mechanics is  
involved, that's not true anymore. Once 
quantum mechanics is involved, in fact,  
energy, even without you doing anything, starts 
to leave black holes. The problem, as far as  
our distant descendants will be concerned, is 
that it leaves black holes extremely slowly. 
So if you took a solar mass black hole, same mass 
as the sun, just collapsed to form a black hole,  
there'll be this little quantum, what's called 
Hawking radiation nowadays, little quantum Hawking  
radiation in which the energy will leach out again 
very, very slowly. The temperature of a solar mass  
black hole is measured in nanokelvins, a very 
low temperature. So the energy leeches out when  
something that cold, so cold you couldn't even see 
it in the cosmic microwave background, it leeches  
out incredibly slowly back into the universe.
And that's bad news because it means the energy  
comes out super duper slowly. 
So the mining question is,  
can you speed that up? A solar mass black hole, 
if you don't help it, will take about 10 to the  
55 times the current age of the universe to have 
given out all its energy back into the universe. 
Can you make that faster? There were these 
proposals stretching back a few decades that  
you could do what's called mining black holes, 
where we see the Hawking radiation that escapes  
when we are a very long way away from the black 
hole. But actually, mathematically, it's known  
that much of the Hawking radiation doesn't escape.
It just sort of makes it a little bit out of the  
black hole and then falls back in again. And there 
was this proposal that you could kind of reach in  
with a mechanical claw, obviously not crossing 
the horizon, because otherwise, you've lost  
the claw and you're somewhat counterproductive, 
but just outside the horizon, just grab some of  
that Hawking radiation and just drag it a long 
way away from the black hole and then feast on  
it or do whatever it is you want to do with 
it. In that way, you could mine a black hole. 
You could speed up the evaporation of a 
black hole by a huge factor. So in fact,  
the lifetime would no longer go like the mass 
cubed, like it does with just unaided Hawking  
radiation, but would scale like just the mass, 
so considerably faster for a large black hole. 
So this was these proposals and what I had a 
somewhat pessimistic contribution to the story,  
which is that the existing proposals 
did not work. They didn't work to speed  
it up. And in fact, you can't speed it up.
You can't get down that M cubed down to M. You  
can't, in fact, get it anything less than M cubed. 
It still scales like the mass cubed. The length of  
time you need to wait to get all the energy out 
of a black hole still scales like the mass cubed. 
And what goes wrong is ultimately a material 
science problem. So this scoop that comes  
down really close to the horizon, now, from one 
point of view, that's just like a space elevator,  
albeit a very high-performance space 
elevator. Space elevators, you'll remember,  
are these ideas for how we might get things off 
the surface of the Earth without using rockets. 
The idea is that you have some massive 
orbiting object sort of very long way away,  
beyond geostationary orbit, and then you dangle 
off that a rope down to the surface of the Earth,  
and then you can essentially just climb up the 
rope to get out. That's the space elevator idea.  
And already around Earth, it's hitting 
pretty hard material science constraints. 
So if you want to make a space elevator, the 
trouble with making a space elevator isn't  
so much supporting the payload that you're 
trying to have climb up. It is merely just  
the rope supporting its own weight because each 
bit of the rope needs to support not only its  
own weight but also the weight of all of the rope 
beneath it. So the tension that you require keeps  
getting more and more and more as you go up.
At the bottom, there is no tension effect.  
It doesn't even touch the Earth. It's not 
like a compression structure that's like  
a skyscraper that's pushed up from below. It's 
a tension structure that's held up from above. 
But as you go up, because you need more and 
more tension, you also need to make the rope  
thicker and thicker and thicker. And if 
you try and on Earth or around Earth,  
build a space elevator out of steel, say, it 
just doesn't work. Steel is not strong enough. 
You need to keep doubling the thickness until, 
by the time you get to geostationary orbit,  
the thickness of the steel rope is 
more than the size of the Earth. Like,  
the whole thing just doesn't work at all. 
But carbon nanotubes are this material that  
we discovered that are much stronger than steel.
So, in fact, around Earth, carbon nanotubes will  
just about work. If we can make them long 
enough and pure enough, then they will be  
strong enough that we will be able to build 
a space elevator around Earth in, you know,  
maybe sometime in the next century, that you only 
need a couple of doublings of the thickness of  
the carbon nanotubes along its entire length. 
So carbon nanotubes work great around Earth,  
but they are totally inadequate for black holes.
For black holes, the critical material science  
property you need for this rope is the 
tensile strength to mass per unit length  
ratio. It needs to be strong, high tensile 
strength, but low weight, light, low mass per  
unit length. And that's the critical ratio.
And carbon nanotubes is 10 to the minus 12  
or something on that scale. And that is 
simply not strong enough at all. In fact,  
what I showed in my paper is that you need a 
tensile strength to weight ratio that is as  
strong as is consistent with the laws of nature.
So, in fact, the laws of nature bound this  
quantity. The finiteness of the speed of 
light means you cannot have an arbitrarily  
strong rope with a given mass per unit length. 
There is a bound set by the C squared in some  
units that bounds the maximum possible 
tensile strength that any rope can have. 
Any rope, in fact, that has that, or 
an example of a rope that has that,  
is a string. So a string is, I mean, a fundamental 
string from string theory is an example of a  
hypothetical rope that is just strong enough 
to saturate that bound, that strength bound.  
And then the problem is the following.
The problem is that if you have a rope that  
saturates the bound as strong as any rope can be, 
it is just strong enough to support all of its own  
weight exactly on the edge there, with exactly 
no strength left over to support any payload  
it might wish to carry. And that's ultimately 
what dooms these mining black holes, you know,  
these rapid mining black hole proposals.
And what happens if you try to make the  
rope stronger?
Well, you can't.  
One example of a thing that goes wrong is the 
speed of sound in a rope goes up with the tension  
and down with the mass per unit length. And if 
you try and use a rope that's stronger than this  
or some hypothetical rope, you would find that the 
speed of sound is greater than the speed of light.  
And that's a pretty good indication.
What is the speed of sound? 
So, if you just take a rope stretched 
between you and me and ping it,  
there will be little vibrations that 
head over towards you. Those vibrations  
are subluminal. If it's just a normal rope, 
they move at the speed of light. For a string or  
something that saturates null energy condition, 
it would be faster than the speed of light. 
That would be an example of why there's 
something wrong with that proposal. 
So, it just happens to be the case that the rope 
cannot mine black holes. I think we've mentioned  
a couple of other bounds like this where there's 
no principled reason you might have anticipated  
ex ante why there would be such a bound that 
prevents something that just gets in our way,  
but it just so happens to be this way.
Does this suggest that there's some sort of  
deeper conservation principle we'd be violating? 
And then the universe conspires to create these  
engineering difficulties which limit that?
Yes, nothing is ever a coincidence. Usually,  
from the perspective of the story I just told 
to do with mining black holes, it's not clear  
what exactly will be broken about the universe 
if you could mine black holes somewhat faster  
than we can. There are other ways of thinking 
about it in which, if you could make a string  
that was strong enough to actually do it, if 
you could make a rope that was stronger than  
this bound, various other things would go wrong.
There are various symmetry arguments that that  
can't happen. But often, it turns out, if we have 
these bounds, that there's something that sort of  
saturates the bound or gets very close to the 
bound. And that's a sign that you're on the  
right lines with some of these bounds.
On the right lines in what sense? 
As in, if you have a bound but you can't think 
how to get close to the bound, that's usually an  
indication that you need to think closer. Because 
often these bounds, if you're clever enough,  
there's a way to get to the bound.
There's no rule that it has to be so,  
but that's often the case. Someone will come up 
with a bound, and there will be a gap between  
the bound and how close we can get. Usually, 
more ingenuity will take you up to the bound. 
I guess the thing I'm curious about is why 
it would be the case that such a bound would  
exist in the first place. And how often do you run 
into these things? Basically, are you expecting to  
discover something in the future about why it had 
to be this way, that you can't mine black holes? 
Something would be violated that tells 
us something important about black holes,  
that they can't be mined, and it's deeper 
than the tensile strength of the string  
that would be required to mine it.
Yeah, good question. I started these  
investigations because it offended my intuition 
for various information theoretic reasons,  
the idea that black holes could be mined with 
parametric speed ups. When I thought harder  
about it, the reasons why I thought that 
couldn't happen didn't really make sense. 
So in this particular case, maybe someone 
will come up with a reason. I don't actually  
have a particularly strong reason why they 
can't be mined anymore, except that they can't. 
Okay, so we can't get the material out 
of the black hole at a pace that would  
make it reasonably useful to us. What can we 
do with black holes? What are they good for? 
If you have a small black hole, you can get 
stuff out of them more rapidly. The temperature  
of a black hole is inversely proportional 
to its size. So one thing that people have  
talked about with black holes is using them 
to extract all of the energy from matter. 
As you know, most chemical reactions are pretty 
inefficient. You burn gasoline and you extract, as  
a function of the rest mass of the gasoline that 
you started with, one part in 10 billion of energy  
from the gasoline that you started with. So that's 
bad from the point of view, you know, you have MC  
squared worth in a gallon of gasoline. You've 
got a full MC squared worth of energy in there,  
and you can only get out one part in 10 to the 
10. That's a pretty unsatisfactory situation. 
Roughly speaking, the reason that all chemical 
processes are so inefficient is that they only  
address the electromagnetic energy in the 
electrons. A very small fraction of the  
electromagnetic energy in an electron in atoms 
is stored in the electromagnetic interaction  
between the electrons and between the nucleus 
and the electrons. Most of it is stored in  
the nucleus itself, in the strong nuclear 
forces, and particularly in the rest mass  
of the protons and neutrons that constitute it.
So you can do much better if, instead of doing  
electromagnetic interactions, you use nuclear 
interactions that can probe the energy in turning  
protons into neutrons. That's why nuclear power 
plants are so much more efficient on a per mass  
basis than chemical power plants like coal 
plants or gas plants because you're getting  
a much higher fraction. Best case scenario, 
you're getting one part in 10 to the three  
or 10 to the four of the rest mass of the uranium 
that you start with, you're extracting as energy. 
But even there, even in that process, it's still 
only absolute best one part in a thousand of  
the rest mass. And the reason is that you are 
using where much more of the energy is stored,  
which is the strong and weak interactions 
between the protons and the neutrons.  
So much more is available to you.
But still, at the end of whatever  
the process you finish with there, 
there's a number that will be conserved,  
and that is what's called the baryon number. So 
it's the total number of protons plus the total  
number of neutrons. You can transmute protons 
into neutrons or vice versa in nuclear processes,  
which is part of the reason they're so much more 
energy than things that just affect the chemistry. 
But still, most of the energy is stored in the 
rest mass of the protons and the neutrons. And  
you want to get that, and nuclear processes 
conserve that. Beta decay will maybe turn a  
proton into a neutron or vice versa, 
but the total number of protons plus  
neutrons is not changing. And so therefore 
99.9% of the energy is inaccessible to you. 
So what you need to do to get that energy 
and try and get most of the MC squared out  
of the matter that you have, what you 
need to do is use a process that eats  
baryon number, in which you can start off 
with a proton and a neutron and end up with  
no proton or neutron. Instead, all of that 
energy is unleashed in high energy radiation  
that you can use for your own purposes.
So electromagnetic interactions won't do  
that. Strong interactions also won't do that. 
Weak interactions won't do that. The only force  
of nature that will do that, with a small caveat, 
the only force of nature that we know that will  
do that is the gravitational interaction.
And so it is a property of black holes that  
you can stand outside the black hole and throw 
protons and neutrons into the black holes, and  
then it'll process it and then spit out photons 
at the end in Hawking radiation and gravitons,  
which is going to be slightly annoying to have 
to capture, and neutrinos. But they're there in  
principle, and in principle, you could capture 
them. So one thing that black holes might be  
technologically useful for in the future is you 
start off with a much smaller black hole than  
what I've described, than the size of the sun.
Be very careful about making sure it doesn't grow. 
You can be super duper careful and throw 
in protons and neutrons and then get out  
photons. In principle, if you could capture 
everything that's emitted from the black hole,  
including the gravitons and the neutrinos, 
that gets rid of the baryon number conservation  
problem. It allows you to build power 
plants that approach 100% efficiency. 
And by 100%, I mean, not the way 
we measure gas turbine efficiency,  
where we talk about the total available chemical 
energy in the gas. I mean, 100% of the MC squared  
of the entire gas you're putting in.
Although, if you consider our cosmic  
endowment, we're not exactly lacking for mass.
We have a lot of mass. On the other hand, we also  
have plans for our future that involve exponential 
growth, and eventually we will run low on that  
mass. Not that many doublings before using up the 
whole galaxy, so you want to use it carefully. 
Let's talk about black holes. How much 
information can a black hole store? 
That's a great question. That has been a very 
productive line of thought. The answer to that  
question goes back to Hawking and Penrose.
You could even ask another question, which is:  
how much information can anything store?
Can we back up? Why do we ask this question of  
black holes in particular? How often do 
we ask, "How much information can the  
Sun store?" Why are we interested in how 
much information a black hole can store? 
Well, it turns out that that's been an incredibly 
productive line of thought. And it also turns  
out that that is the main fact that we're 
most confident about about quantum gravity. 
So the two great theories of 20th century 
physics: gravity, Einstein's theory of  
the curvature of spacetime and gravity; and 
quantum mechanics, the theory of the very small,  
to do with Heisenberg's uncertainty principles and 
atomic spectra. Gravity tends to make itself felt  
at the very large scale, and quantum mechanics 
tends to make itself seen at the very small scale. 
These are the two most beautiful theories of 20th 
century physics, the two things that we should be  
most proud about that we discovered in the early 
20th century. It was noticed pretty early on that  
these two theories seem to be inconsistent 
with each other. The most obvious ways to try  
and reconcile quantum mechanics and gravity 
break. You can't really shove them together. 
And this is a problem if you think that 
the world should be comprehensible, that  
there should be some theory that is consistent, 
that describes the world. So this has been a big  
project in theoretical physics over the last 
few decades, trying to understand how we can  
take Einstein's general relativity and quantum 
mechanics and make them meld together in a  
mathematically and physically consistent manner.
It's tricky, in part because there's very little  
experimental guidance because general relativity 
tends to make itself felt at large scales,  
quantum mechanics at small scales. So trying to 
find a place where they meet in the middle, and it  
must be that they do meet, but trying to 
drag that out with experiment is very tricky. 
This has been a big project, trying to 
figure out how to do this. Einstein spent  
some years unsuccessfully doing this in the 
later, less productive part of his career. 
This project of trying to unite these is 
something that a lot of people have thought  
a lot about. String theory comes out of this 
project, a number of other lines of thought. 
There is, however, one fact about that merger 
that we are most confident about, and about  
anything about the merger. And that exactly 
returns to this question of how much  
information you can store in a given region 
of spacetime. And in fact, how much region. 
And the answer to that involves black 
holes. So the answer is how much? If  
you have a region of a certain area, maybe 
a sphere of a certain area, and you said,  
"How much information can you store in that 
region?" The amount of information you can store,  
measured in bits, the entropy of that region, is 
given by the area of that region divided by G,  
Newton's constant, and H bar, Planck's constant.
So that's how you know that this is something to  
do with quantum gravity because 
it involves both G and H bar. 
Is that the only situation in physics where both 
of those constants end up being in the same place? 
That is not the only situation. No, anytime you 
have quantum gravity, they'll tend to be in the  
same place. And sometimes even when you don't have 
quantum gravity, but you have the interplay of  
gravitational forces and quantum degeneracy 
pressures, those will also end up in those. 
But it's in some sense the simplest situation 
in which it occurs, which is why so much  
time has been spent thinking about thought 
experiments to do with black holes. So there  
was a physicist called Bekenstein who figured 
out that that should be the answer, the area  
divided by GH bar. And then Hawking's great 
contribution to physics was figuring out that  
it was the area divided by GH bar, but he also got 
the pre-factor, and the pre-factor was a quarter. 
So Hawking figured out that it's a quarter at 
the area divided by 4GH bar. And this is a super  
interesting answer. How much information can you 
store in a given region is given by the area. And  
in fact, black holes maximize that. Black holes 
store that amount of information in a given area. 
But specifically area, meaning surface area?
Meaning surface area, exactly. The reason  
that that's such a wild answer, and an answer 
that's led to all sorts of thought experiments  
to do with quantum gravity ever since then, is 
that you might naively think that the amount of  
information you can store in a region is given 
not by its surface area, but by its volume. 
If I have a hard drive, and I take another 
hard drive, and another hard drive,  
and another hard drive, and I keep piling them 
up, the amount of information I can store on  
those hard drives scales like the number of 
those hard drives. That means it scales like  
the volume of the region in which I'm storing the 
hard drives. Everything we know about classical  
thermodynamics tells us that the amount of 
information should scale like the volume. 
Everything we know about non-gravitational 
physics tends to point in the direction that  
the amount of information you can store goes like 
the volume. And yet, this is the most surprising  
fact that is incredibly generative: once you 
add gravity to the picture, once you combine  
quantum mechanics and gravity, the amount of 
information you can store in a given region,  
a given sphere, goes like the surface area of 
that region, not like the volume of that region. 
You might think that that can't possibly be right. 
You might give the following argument: there's  
some region, and I'm just going to keep adding 
more and more hard drives to that region. As I  
make that region bigger and bigger and bigger, 
the amount of information on those hard drives  
scales like the number of those hard drives, 
which goes like the radius of that region cubed. 
The thing about the radius of the region cubed 
is it grows faster at a large radius than the  
radius of that region squared. So I just told you 
that the amount of information you can store in a  
region is given by the surface area, and yet I 
also gave you a way to make it scale like the  
volume. So eventually, if I make the region big 
enough, the amount of information in that volume  
will be bigger than the bound that I just said.
Therefore, I've ruled out Hawking's, Penrose's,  
and Bekenstein's bound. What goes wrong with 
that thought experiment is that eventually,  
if I make a big enough pile of hard drives, 
the whole pile of hard drives will undergo  
gravitational collapse and form a black hole.
But then there has to be an experiment--not  
experimental, but do you have to crunch 
the numbers then to determine that just  
before the pile of hard drives 
would collapse into a black hole,  
the amount of information stored in that cubic 
pile of hard drives is less than the amount of  
information that then gets turned into the surface 
area of the black hole? Because theoretically,  
I don't know if I'm getting my mathematicians 
right, it's theoretically possible that even  
though the black hole is smaller because it's only 
the surface area, the cubic ends up being bigger. 
You have to run that calculation. But if you 
do run the calculation, it turns out that  
it's nowhere near. It wasn't close.
It's not one of those things where  
they just balance each other out.
They don't just balance each other  
out. If I take an online shopping website and 
I buy a bunch of Western Digital hard drives,  
and I calculate the information storage 
capacity of those and compare it to the  
area of a black hole, I figure out when 
the pressure in the hard drive would be  
enough to stop it collapsing to form a 
black hole. It is nowhere close. It will  
make a black hole way before it comes close 
to violating the Bekenstein-Hawking bound. 
Got it. Okay, sorry. I didn't 
mean to interrupt. And then you... 
So that's the information storage in black 
holes. The reason you know that that's also  
the information storage bound for anything, not 
just black holes, is that if you had something  
that wasn't a black hole that had more information 
than that in a given region, and you just added  
matter, eventually that thing itself would 
collapse to form a black hole. And so it couldn't  
be the case, just logically, that it had more 
information than the black hole. It'll tend to... 
You just hinted at the idea that somehow this is 
the most productive line of thought that physics  
has come up with in the last few decades. Why 
is that? Why does the fact that the area is  
proportional to the information of a black 
hole tell us so much about the universe? 
It's been extremely important for our 
understanding of quantum gravity. It's perhaps the  
central fact that we know about quantum gravity: 
the information scales with the area. That fact,  
which was known since the 70s, was a big 
hint that became very influential later on. 
As understood by Bekenstein and Hawking, it was 
just a weird fact about black holes, perhaps.  
But we now understand it as a strong indication 
of what we call the holographic principle. The  
holographic principle has been a powerful idea 
in quantum gravity, and it's the following. 
If you took a non-gravitational system in which 
you ignored gravity, like the pile of hard drives,  
the information storage would scale like the 
volume, as we discussed. Whereas in fact,  
it scales like the area. Another way to say 
that is if you take a three-dimensional,  
three-plus-one-dimensional theory in which 
you have both quantum mechanics and gravity,  
the information storage scales 
like R squared rather than R cubed. 
That is, it scales as though you had a 
non-gravitational system in one fewer  
dimension. So if you had a two-dimensional theory 
in which there was no gravity, the information  
stored in a given region would also scale like 
R squared because the information would be just  
the two-dimensional volume, as in the area. So 
in other words, at least as far as information  
density, the information capacity is concerned, a 
gravitational theory in three dimensions is like  
a non-gravitational theory in two dimensions.
Or more generally, a gravitational theory in  
n dimensions is like a non-gravitational 
theory in n minus 1 dimensions. So that  
is a big hint that forms the basis of the 
holographic principle. It's like gravity eats  
information. There's less information than you 
thought there was, than you naively thought there  
was if you didn't include information.
And so the holographic principle says  
that maybe that's not just a neat observation. 
Maybe it is, in fact, the case that for every,  
or for some quantum gravitational theories, there 
is another theory that is exactly equivalent to  
it in one fewer dimension. And so this led to 
Maldacena's ADS/CFT correspondence, the gauge  
gravity duality, which was the most 
cited paper in high-energy theoretical  
physics ever, I think, maybe at this stage.
In the late 90s, he wrote down an exact,  
we believe, an exact duality between a particular 
theory of quantum gravity, some particular  
flavor of string theory, and a non-gravitational 
theory that lives on the boundary of that space. 
And what problem does it solve if you 
can model the world in fewer dimensions  
that doesn't involve gravity?
This was a very influential paper,  
and really becomes a tremendous 
theoretical laboratory for trying  
to understand the connection between gravity 
and quantum mechanics. One problem it solves  
is this: gravity is mysterious, particularly 
once we improve quantum mechanics in various  
ways. This is why it's hard to quantize gravity.
But if you can say that this theory that involves  
both quantum mechanics and gravity is exactly 
dual—is in some sense the same theory as just  
an alternative description of a theory in 
one fewer dimension that doesn't involve  
gravity—that's great, because we have a much 
better grasp on how to understand theories that  
don't have gravity than we do on theories that 
do have gravity. So, it puts everything on a much  
clearer footing to have this non-gravitational 
description, because then you can just use the  
standard tools of non-gravitational quantum field 
theory in order to define it and understand it. 
At one level, I understand that if the 
information in an area is limited by  
the information that would be on the surface of a 
black hole in that region, then you can model the  
surface area as a two-dimensional object. On the 
other hand, if I just think about the real world,  
you're over there and I'm over here, and if I 
do something here, it's not interacting with  
you. In order to model that fact, I need 
to model the dimension in which—the third  
dimension in which—we're separated.
I guess if I'm actually looking at  
you through a window pane, maybe I wouldn't 
have access to that. So, in two dimensions,  
how do you model that? There's a reason 
we have the third dimension, right? And  
how is that modeled if you reduce that dimension?
Maybe I should just lead with some disappointing  
news: AdS/CFT was a tremendous conceptual 
breakthrough in our understanding of quantum  
gravity and embodied the holographic 
principle, but at the same time,  
it doesn't describe our universe. In particular, 
in AdS/CFT, there is a negative cosmological  
constant in the gravitational theory, 
and our universe, as we discussed before,  
has a positive cosmological constant. So, it's 
great because it provides an existence proof of  
a well-defined theory of quantum gravity—not, 
alas, in the universe in which we live. 
But having said that, it's extremely confusing 
and was a very impressive result precisely  
because you might think, how could it possibly 
be the case that two different theories in two  
different dimensions could turn out to be 
equivalent? The answer to your question is,  
if you have two people who are living in this 
negatively curved space and talking to each other,  
what does that look like in this other theory? 
I say that there's this process going on in  
the gravitational theory that's dual, which is 
exactly isomorphic to some process going on in the  
non-gravitational theory in one fewer dimension.
But what maybe looks very simple in one theory,  
like you and I chatting back and forth to 
each other, would look like some complicated  
plasma physics in the lower-dimensional boundary 
theory. And so, the complexity of how it looks,  
which is a better description, does not need to 
be conserved across the isomorphism. In fact,  
that's often what we use it for.
We use it to do arbitrage between  
things that look simple in one theory and things 
that look simple in the alternative description.  
We use the fact that things look simple in one 
to understand the sort of complicated version in  
the other. In fact, it flows in both directions.
You might naively expect that because gravity is  
so complicated, we would always be using the 
non-gravitational theory to understand the  
gravitational theory. That's not always true. 
Plasma physics is itself extremely complicated. 
There are these big collisions that we do at 
RHIC in Brookhaven where we smash two gold atoms  
together and make big fireballs of quark-gluon 
plasma. It's extremely challenging to calculate  
what would happen there, and yet people use this 
duality in the opposite direction to say, even  
though it looks super complicated with this weird 
plasma physics in the non-gravitational theory, it  
actually can simply be understood as some simple 
black hole property in the gravitational theory. 
Maybe not AdS/CFT itself, but would some theory 
which relies on the holographic principle ever  
be able to account for a world like ours, 
where, unlike the surface of a black hole,  
there isn't a boundary because of the positive 
cosmological constant and it's constantly  
expanding? Is there some hope that there in 
fact is a way to have some sort of dual theory  
to this that somehow describes a boundary?
People are working on that. That is an open  
area of research. Ever since the 
original AdS/CFT was written down,  
people have been trying to formulate versions of 
it which have a positive cosmological constant. 
It's difficult. Part of the difficulty 
goes all the way back to Archimedes:  
it is easiest to formulate a theory if you have a 
fixed point on which to stand and observe things  
from a distance. In a universe with a positive 
cosmological constant, you don't have that. 
You don't have that. You're 
necessarily mixed up with the system  
because you live in a universe that has only 
a finite amount of entropy, a finite amount  
of free energy. There is an inherent limitation 
to the precision of the experiments you can do. 
That just makes things way trickier. So, for that 
and related reasons, it's a much harder project,  
but for sure people are working on that.
What is the correct conceptual way to think  
about this? One version is, the boundary is one 
way to simplify the processes that are actually  
four-dimensional. Another is—I don't know 
how we think about this in the context of  
black holes—but maybe in the context of 
black holes, no, the information actually  
is on the horizon. The analogous thing here 
would be, no, somehow we are on the boundary  
of the universe somehow. Is there a sense in 
which one of these interpretations is correct? 
This duality idea, where you have two different 
descriptions of the same thing, is not new. The  
AdS/CFT correspondence was not the first such 
example in physics. It's a common trope in physics  
that you can have two different descriptions of 
the same thing, some of which are more useful  
in one scenario, some of which are more useful in 
the other scenario, but both are exactly correct. 
There are non-gravitational examples in physics 
that go back a long way. You may then ask,  
"Which one is right, and which one is not 
right? Is it actually a CFT that's pretending  
to have this weird alternative description as 
a gravitational theory? Or is the gravitational  
theory correct, and the other one is not correct?"
I think this is more of a philosophical question.  
My answer would be that if the isomorphism was 
just an approximation -- if it was really one  
thing and you were just pretending it was the 
other thing, and that approximation worked in  
some region of validity and not others -- then 
I would say that one was right and the other one  
was just an alternative, fanciful description.
That is not our understanding of AdS/CFT as we  
understand it today. Our understanding is that 
this is a precise isomorphism. It's not an  
analogy, it's not a metaphor, it 
is not an approximation that is  
valid in some domain and not another.
It really is the case that these two  
theories are exactly equivalent to each other. And 
if that's correct, then as a matter of philosophy,  
I would say those are both equally real. So it's 
not the case that one is more real than the other;  
they're perfect simulations of each other.
Are you an AdS dreaming you're a CFT,  
or a CFT dreaming you're an AdS? I think these 
are just two completely different, inequivalent  
descriptions of the same identical physics.
Tell me if this is just a question that doesn't  
make sense. Because when I was, if you try to 
ask somebody about the quantum many worlds,  
"Where are the other worlds?" right? And 
they're just like, "They're in Hilbert space." 
"Where is Hilbert space?"
"No, dude, it's just a  
conceptual thing. Stop asking questions."
Intuitively, it feels like there should be  
a sense in which there is some physical 
existence. Either that existence is in  
this four-dimensional space, or it's in some 
space that exists on the boundary. Is this just  
going to lead us into philosophical loops, or is 
there something that can be said more about it? 
And also, in a de Sitter space, in a world like 
ours, what exactly would the boundary mean? 
There are two components to that question. You 
have an intuition that if something is real,  
it needs to be spatially localized, and things 
that are delocalized in space somehow can't be  
real. I would say that that's not my intuition.
My intuition is that there can be two completely  
different descriptions of the same physics, and 
if it's precise, neither of those is any more  
real than the other. Things do not need to be 
spatially localized. You separately asked, what  
would a version of "where is the boundary theory?" 
in de Sitter space, since there's no boundary? 
That is a great question that people 
who are trying to generalize AdS/CFT  
to a universe like ours, that has a positive 
cosmological constant, wrestle with. There's  
more than one proposal. Some suggest that the 
dual theory should live on the cosmic horizon. 
So, if you go 5 billion light-years, you can send 
information to that point and have it returned to  
you. But on the other hand, there are things that 
are 100 billion light-years away that we'll never  
be able to communicate with. There's a boundary 
between those two -- between things that we could,  
in principle, communicate with and things that 
we couldn't, in principle, communicate with. 
That is the cosmological horizon. Some people 
who are trying to do a version of holography that  
works in universes with a positive cosmological 
constant like to put the second theory there.  
Other people like to put it in the distant 
future, in the sort of infinitely distant future. 
That's part of the problem: where do we 
even put that theory? It's not like in our  
universe where you can just put it spatially 
infinitely far away and be done with it. 
If it's spatially finite, then we are 
currently at the boundary of infinite  
many other universes that are located, 
or whose center is located, elsewhere. 
Absolutely. A cosmological horizon is very 
different from a black hole horizon in  
this regard. A black hole horizon 
-- there is a point of no return. 
If you get closer than that, you fall into the 
black hole; you're never getting out again. And  
everybody can agree where that is. For cosmology, 
there is a point of no return, but the point  
of no return is relative to a given person.
For each person, there is a different point  
of no return. And as you say, we live on 
the boundary just as much as we live on  
the boundary of -- those people live on our 
cosmological horizon, we may live on theirs. 
Okay, another philosophical question. 
There seem to be many theories which imply  
that there's some sort of infinity or approximate 
infinity that exists. In quantum many worlds,  
there are constantly these different 
branches of the wavefunction spawning  
off where things are slightly different.
So everything that can possibly happen  
has happened, including basically the 
same exact thing. I guess if this bubble  
universe stuff is correct, it implies 
a similar picture. Philosophically,  
should it have some implication on our worldview?
It would be surprising that we learned this much  
about the universe and then it has 
no implications whatsoever, right? 
Good question. I think I'm going to say yes and 
no. I mean, it's clearly, if correct, let's just  
take the quantum case, which is perhaps even more 
secure than the cosmological multiverse case. 
In the quantum case, it really does look like 
the default expectation, given everything we  
understand about quantum mechanics, should be the 
many-worlds interpretation in which the universe  
keeps branching off, and there'd be more and 
more branches. Every time, or almost every time  
you come to a point of quantum a measurement, 
we might colloquially say is made that the  
universe branches, and then every possibility is 
represented still in the grander wave function. 
That's a pretty profound thing to learn about 
the ontology of the world. If correct, it seems  
like it should be the default expectation.
And you might say, maybe I don't care about  
existential risk in our universe because we blow 
each other up or turn into goo or whatever. Okay,  
that's sad for us. Maybe our world has vacuum 
decay, but there are some other branches of the  
wave function where it's not. And so some other 
branches will have made different choices in the  
past, and they're sort of guaranteed somewhere 
in the branches of the wave function to be a  
flourishing world. And so I'm not so bothered.
I would say that that's,  
I'm not going to tell you what utility function 
you should place on the wave function, but Born  
is. There's the Born rule in quantum mechanics.
And that tells you that you shouldn't just say,  
if it's there in one branch, that's just 
as good as anything else. Born's rule,  
which is one of the foundational rules in quantum 
mechanics, tells you how much to care about each  
branch. You don't care about them equally.
It says that the correct way to calculate  
the expectation value of anything is to calculate 
its value in each branch and weight those branches  
by the square of the amplitude of the weight 
function, which is some particular quantity,  
and then add together all of those different 
answers. So that's a linear answer, which is  
to say that the total utility of the universe 
is the sum of the utility in each of these  
branches appropriately weighted by Born's rule.
So if that's true, you should hope to make our  
branch as good as possible, just because 
whatever is going on in the other branch,  
the total utility is just the sum of what's 
going on in that branch and what's going on  
our branch. And so you should try as hard as you 
can to make our branches as great as possible. 
Nevertheless, I do kind of understand that you 
might have a portfolio theory that seems to be  
inconsistent with Born's rule, but is somehow 
intuitive, in which somehow it's not just a  
linear function on these universes.
This would only be applicable  
if you are a total utilitarian who then there's a 
sort of very straightforward way in which we can  
dismiss this and be like, it's one of these. It 
seems like in physics, there's always these kinds  
of things where, like, oh, we think we discovered 
something new, but how would you look at that? 
The speed of light is still conserved. 
And similarly here, like, oh, infinite  
universes. Ah, but would you look at that? 
That has no implications on our decisions. 
But most people are not total utilitarians. 
And if you have some very simple thought  
experiments to illustrate a couple. Suppose 
that there are two universes and, sorry,  
two worlds in two different cosmic horizons who 
will never interact with each other causally,  
but each one has intelligent life and civilization 
and beauty and everything we might care about. 
If one of the two gets extinguished, I'm like, 
pretty sad. And this is, both of these make up  
the entire universe. If both of them get 
extinguished, I'm more than twice as sad. 
There's something to that sort of finality which 
makes existential risk salient in the first place.  
And if you agree with that intuition, 
then I think you should be inclined to  
think that there is something significant 
about the fact that in some base reality,  
like genuinely the story carries forward.
On the other end, if you're somebody who cares  
about minimizing the downside of people talking 
about suffering, risk or something. Right. The  
idea that if it's physically possible to have a 
universe full of torture, it's actually in fact  
happening or will happen again is like you could 
just be like, ah, but the amplitude on that is so  
small or the square of the amplitude is so small.
And. 
The weighted average ends up 
close to nothing. But I'm like,  
that really sucks, that's actually happening.
Yeah, I think there are a number of ways to think  
about this. I think in part people's intuition 
is maybe formed in cases like extinction,  
where if you have an animal that's going 
extinct, if half of the animals get wiped out,  
that's somehow less bad than if both 
halves of the animals get wiped out. 
But that's because they really aren't 
going to interact in the future. And  
there's the possibility of the. Those don't 
have non-overlapping future light cones, the  
two populations of some possibly extinct animal.
It's also the case that this is a pretty like  
Born's rule, narrowly defined, does not 
really have anything to say about this how  
one should calculate the total utility. 
It's just more of a sort of the natural  
utility measure that would come out of this.
Particularly when you get to the cosmological  
multiverse. I think that these are very difficult 
questions to answer your intuition that perhaps  
two different universes in which how we calculate 
those do we just add together the utility in both  
or is there some non-linearity to do with it?
Basically, for the cosmological multiverse,  
there isn't a particularly good way to decide 
what the weighting factor should be. We don't  
have the same equivalent of Born's rule in 
quantum mechanics. And I think it's at least  
open for opinions like yours to be to be.
In fact, there should be some better way  
in which we calculate it. That's 
not just a linear function of. 
These different kinds of infinities 
is there some sense in which some are  
more fundamental than others. That is, maybe 
the bubbles are artifacts of what's actually  
happening on the wave function, or vice versa.
You're talking about the two kinds of multiverse,  
the sort of cosmological multiverse and 
the quantum mechanical multiverse. Yeah,  
they get very bound up if you try and 
write down a theory that has both of them. 
Because whether there's a bubble there, you're 
trying to make bubble universes. But what  
gives rise to bubble universes is often quantum 
processes. So often you end up in superpositions  
over there being a bubble universe and 
there not being a bubble universe there. 
And that means that these two kinds of multiverse, 
the sort of quantum mechanical multiverse  
and the cosmological multiverse end up 
getting totally intermeshed with each other. 
But it sounds like the base reality is 
still the wave function over all the  
bubbles in the entire inflaton field or whatever.
Yeah. So again, we only really properly know how  
to do quantum gravity and do the counting when 
there's a negative cosmological constant. As we  
discussed with ADS cft, in these bubble universes, 
where there's a positive cosmological constant,  
it's still somewhat an open question how to do the 
accounting of what happens and where and how much  
it should count out.
Okay. 
Which is to say we don't know the answer to that 
question, and your opinion is not ruled out. 
It's a little bit confusing because in one 
context, we're laying out very practical—I  
don't know if you can call black hole batteries 
practical—but very tangible limitations on the  
what future, like very distant future descendants, 
could do with all the matter in the galaxy and  
so forth. On the other hand, we're like, 
"Bubble universes as big as our own made  
somewhere in somebody's lab, maybe." So, 
basically, how confident are we that the  
practical limitations we think we know about 
will actually constrain our future descendants? 
That's a good question. Certainly, some of 
the possibilities we've discussed so far have  
different epistemic statuses about how confident 
we are or are not. And as we also discussed,  
some of these bounds are somewhat fragile.
Can you communicate faster than the speed of  
light, for example? Let's just take that 
as an example bound. We think you can't,  
according to the laws of science as we understand 
it. Most physicists would be pretty surprised  
if it turned out that you could.
What is your probability if, like, a million  
years from now, we are able to communicate 
faster than light? How surprised are you? 
That is a tricky one. That is a really tricky 
one. It's only a century that we've thought you  
can't communicate faster than the speed of light.
A million years is such a radical time that maybe  
we've sort of dissolved the question into some 
greater question, and we understand it doesn't  
even really make sense. I would be pretty 
surprised. If you make me make a number,  
I think that there is a greater 
than 90% chance that in 100 years,  
we are still limited by the speed of light. 
There's a 98% chance, if you make me be precise. 
Okay, so then what are the other constraints on a 
future civilization that they might care about? If  
we've got these superhuman intelligences and 
they're colonizing the galaxy, what are the  
things they might want to do that they 
can't do? They probably care about  
energy. They care about computation.
Energy limits. We've talked about the  
efficiency of batteries and extracting energy.
MC squared is the—I'm highly confident that the  
most energy you can extract from a given piece 
of matter is MC squared, at least until you start  
getting cosmology involved. Other limits will be 
Landauer's limit, or in other words, with a given  
amount of energy, how useful is a given amount of 
energy to you? We wouldn't care about having huge  
amounts of energy if you could get an arbitrary 
amount of value out of a fixed unit of energy. 
We think that that's not true. We think that in 
particular, if we're going to do computations  
with it, for example, that there's going to 
be—and that computation makes errors—that  
there is a fixed cost of a bit, basically a bit 
of free energy, in order to correct those errors. 
And we're confident that there's no way 
to make computers that don't make errors? 
It is a very interesting question what the 
fundamental limits on errors are in a computer,  
how far down they can be pushed. 
In terms of never making errors,  
I think that's very unlikely. If for no other 
reason than there is a minimum background  
temperature caused by the expansion of our 
universe—again, it all comes back to the  
cosmological constant—that gives a very small 
but non-zero temperature to our universe, that  
I think will inevitably mean that we make errors.
You might imagine we could just set up some kind  
of perpetual motion machine that's just thinking 
happy thoughts over and over again in a quantum  
computer that never tires and never stops. I 
think that inevitably the universe would leak in,  
and there would be errors. But what the 
minimum error rate is, is not—I don't  
have a clear answer to that question. Physics 
doesn't have a clear answer to that question. 
One question you might have is: What will be the 
nature of not only the things that our descendants  
might care about, but what will they be able 
to produce domestically? What will they want  
to trade for? If something like alchemy is just 
super—you know, it's like equals MC squared is  
all you care about—then it's just like, look, 
your star system or your galaxy has a certain  
amount of mass, and you can convert that to 
energy, and there's fundamentally no reason to  
trade if there's not that high transaction 
cost to make it into whatever you want. 
On the other hand, if there are some limits, like 
in fact you had to make galaxy-wide factories,  
or you had to do these NP-hard calculations that 
even with a galaxy you can only trace down certain  
segments of the search space or something, 
there might be reasons to trade extremely—sort  
of a pie-in-the-sky question—but how much can 
we intuit about these kinds of constraints? 
In economics, the theory of comparative 
advantage only applies if not all resources  
can be transported. If you can just 
go in and just disassemble whoever  
you're doing the comparative advantage with, you 
might as well just turn them into—apply it all to  
the party with the absolute advantage. So maybe 
the same thing would be true in the universe. 
I think there are a number of questions in there. 
For starters, not all energy is equally useful in  
different places in the universe. If there's a 
galaxy over there and a galaxy here on this side  
of the universe, because of the expansion of the 
universe, if I beamed the energy—if I disassembled  
that galaxy and tried to send it back here, 
either by literally sending it on starships  
or converting it to light and beaming the light 
back in a laser and then having a big PV here to  
collect it, or for whatever mechanism—by the time 
it reached me, there will be a massive redshift. 
So keeping it in place is maybe better than just 
disassembling it and bringing it back home. But  
there's another question, which is—these are all 
unknowns to do with both physics and the nature  
of technology—is the most important thing that 
all of the value will be created here on Earth,  
and we just need to get as many resources back 
here on Earth? And there are super linear returns  
to scale of having accumulated resources in one 
place, so we just want to make Earth an absolute  
paradise? Or do we want to spread—is it in fact 
sublinear, and we want to spread civilization  
all the way throughout all of these galaxies?
I think questions like that are going to be  
important in addressing your question of what the 
returns to scale are and returns to trade as well. 
It's like the galaxy in a billion years from now 
has a certain GDP. What percentage of that GDP do  
you think is just the end result of computations 
or confirmation that a computation has been  
made? Maybe it's like simulating hedonium that the 
other side of the galaxy cares about or something. 
Just because it may prove to be so much more 
efficient to do things in simulation than to  
do them in the real world, my guess would be a 
high percentage of that. But maybe that's wrong. 
If computing is the main thing you hear 
about, what is going to be the—physically,  
how will the flops in a galaxy be organized? Will 
it be as planet-wide computers, as a huge blob the  
size of a star system? Do we have some sense of—
This is a super interesting question. It returns  
to the question we were asking before: with 
quantum computers, we know, for example,  
that the amount of quantum computation you can 
do in terms of the equivalent amount of classical  
computation when trying to do some factoring 
algorithm or something grows super-linearly  
with the number of qubits. In fact, it grows 
almost exponentially with the number of qubits. 
So a 200-qubit quantum computer is much 
more than twice as good as a 100-qubit  
quantum computer for certain tasks. But for the 
tasks that we try and use quantum computers for,  
that's true. So that line of reasoning might 
lead you to believe that in the distant future,  
we will just try, even paying the cost of 
the redshift and all these other questions,  
we'll feed all of the energy and free energy 
back into one central quantum computer. 
It will all be about making that central quantum 
computer as big as we possibly can, even at the  
cost of inefficiency. On the other hand, there are 
other kinds of tasks for which actually having a  
twice-as-big computer is not that much better, 
or certainly not more than twice as better,  
than having two smaller computers. In that 
scenario, it'll be a more distributed setup. 
I guess in this quantum computer system, you would 
need to have coherence across this huge, which  
might not be a practical engineering difficulty 
for future civilizations, but does seem... 
Either it would need to be co-located, or 
you'd need to send the quantum coherence  
out. That's actually not that hard to do. It's 
a property of photons that they do tend to  
maintain when they're propagating in the vacuum.
They basically maintain their coherence for a very  
long way. In fiber optic cables, you reach trouble 
because they start getting absorbed by the fiber  
optics after tens of miles. But in the vacuum, you 
could, in principle, share quantum entanglement  
across the universe if you did it right.
Then wouldn't you expect, when you say a  
central computer, physically it wouldn't 
just be like a huge, contiguous... 
Well, it might be because the sort of analog 
of the classical fact that flops are not the  
only thing you care about. You also care about 
bandwidth and interconnects and things like  
that. So perhaps the same would be true.
I mean, here we're getting into a pretty  
speculative area, but you could 
imagine either configuration,  
either one in which you have a huge number of 
different quantum computers that are talking to  
each other via entanglement networks or one in 
which you just have one big central computer. 
Final question. Timeline to when 
you are automated as a physicist. 
Oh, good question. Many of the tasks that I might 
have performed in the past, I think, are already  
automated at some level. Until I am totally 
out of the picture and no longer necessary... 
That's probably pretty close to ASI complete. 
So whatever your timeline for ASI is. 
Well, I guess the question is, what is yours?
Yeah, I'm squirming somewhat uncomfortably in  
answer to that question because I'm 
not totally sure. I could certainly  
imagine a scenario in which it's five years.
All right. I think that's a great place to  
close. Adam, thanks so much.
Thank you. Great to be here.
