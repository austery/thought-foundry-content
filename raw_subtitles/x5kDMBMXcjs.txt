So you've uncovered, you've unpacked, and now you need to move forward and change yourself from someone who thinks they can't make mistakes to a different person. That has to start with like actually just believing that you can change, right? If you've always identified as a perfectionist, it's part of your identity. How do you sort of move to a mode in which you wouldn't believe that? So it's so interesting, Alison, that you're even using the terminology "change who you are," because actually, I don't see this as changing who you are. I think underlying this is people mistaken that their beliefs are who they are. All of our beliefs are learned. They're what we learned in order to be successful or in order to survive or thrive in any context that we were in early on in life and as we moved through life. The key here is they're malleable. They're things that you can change according to what it is that you want rather than react. to the experiences that you had in the past. But it doesn't necessarily change who you are as a person. If anything, it expands who you are. And so when you start seeing it from that perspective, I think that that is the mindset that then leads to more openness to say, oh, okay, yes, I can pick up another belief, or I can now start doing the work in this way, which then allows you to actually move into this action phase, which is if I pick up this new belief, if I've reframed it, And I've moved from, "I can't make a mistake," to, "We're going to do the best that we can with the resources that we have," or, "We're going to do the best that we can with the information that we have." Then you can say, "Okay, well, what actions align with that that will allow me to get to the outcome that I want?"
