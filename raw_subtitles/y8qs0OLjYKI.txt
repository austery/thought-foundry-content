>> Prime Minister Mark Carney
and Chinese President XI Jinping
recently announced they'd struck
a deal after years of tension
between their two countries.
Tariffs on Chinese EVs will be
lifted on up to 49,000 vehicles
in exchange for China lowering
its tariffs on canola.
Premier Doug Ford wasn't
initially happy about the deal.
Not happy at all, but a meeting
with the Prime minister seems to
have brought the temperature
down.
The strategy a task force with
Ontario to consult on strategy
and job protection.
So how big could the market here
be for Chinese EVs?
Will the drivers of this country
embrace them?
I sat down with Stephanie
Woodcroft, former president of
the Automotive Journalists
Association of Canada, to talk
about how cheaper EVs will roll
out in Ontario and the rest of
Canada, and how much this will
shake up the market.
Stephanie, great to have you on
the show.
How are you doing?
>> Doing great.
Thanks.
Very happy to be here.
>> All right.
We're going to talk about Doug
Ford.
First off a bit of a change of
tune.
He hasn't called for a boycott
of Chinese EVs since he met with
Prime Minister Mark Carney and
Industry Minister Melanie Joly.
What do you think?
They might have told him about
the plan?
I know there's lots of details
that we'd like to know about it
as well, but what do you think
has kind of settled him a little
bit.
>> And I'm not any more privy to
information than anybody else,
but my guess is not whatever
happened in that room where it
happened.
I think Doug Ford was shown some
dollar signs.
Okay.
Yes.
I have a feeling that there are
aspects of this China-Canada
arrangement that involve
bringing some manufacturing of
vehicles to Canada, vehicles,
possibly also batteries.
It makes a lot of sense.
>> What he wants, right?
Speaking back to the point that
Prime Minister Carney made in
Davos that Canada has what the
world wants, when we're talking
about what Canada has that the
auto industry wants, that's
critical minerals, right?
So it makes fiscal sense or it
seems to because we're now
seeing other automakers
jockeying for position on this
as well.
Volkswagen is building a battery
plant outside of St. Thomas.
We just earlier this week
learned that South Korea and
China and Canada signed a
memorandum of understanding
around possibly bringing some
manufacturing battery and
vehicle to Canada.
And that's related to the
submarine deal, which is a whole
other topic, right.
But bringing that back to China,
that those dots all connect to
making it seem as though it
makes fiscal sense to build the
batteries and build the cars
where the minerals are coming
from, rather than shipping them
around the world.
So I would imagine there's a
portion of this deal that hasn't
gone public yet that may involve
scaling up the the quota that
comes into Canada over time.
And with that, also China making
some manufacturing investment,
which of course brings jobs and
just bolsters the economy.
It makes a lot of sense with the
Ring of fire being developed in
northern Ontario, that that
would end up being in Ontario,
where that manufacturing would
take place.
And that brings us back to Doug
Ford being a happy man.
>> All right.
Well, let's get away from the
headlines for a minute.
I want to talk about some
numbers from last year.
Sales of electric vehicles in
Canada plummeted in 2025.
Not the story.
When we look at Europe, across
Africa, the Middle East, China,
they rose.
Why are EV sales in Canada so
low?
>> A lot of that comes down to
price, which is why we're
talking about this entire
subject, right to to recap, for
anybody who's not familiar with
the the Canada-China deal, it's
49,000 EVs that Canada has
committed to bringing in from
China at a lower tariff.
There was a 100% tariff that was
in place to match with the
United States.
This is 6.1% a significant drop,
right?
And to come back to your point,
Europe and the Middle East and
other markets are already
getting those those cheap EVs.
50% of that allotment of the
49,000 is meant to be priced off
the boat, at least under 35,000.
Whether that's going to equate
to that when it gets to
dealership lots is a different
story.
But that does speak to the point
that we don't have anything at
that price point in our market
right now.
And this this creates the
potential to to bolster that,
especially in the wake of the
federal government having
cancelled the EV rebates, which
were the only thing that were
bringing some of those cars even
close to that level.
And that coincided exactly with
that drop in sales that you were
talking about.
>> So fair to say the cars that
would be imported from China
here don't necessarily have
competition.
Right now in Canada, there is a
glaring gap.
Or give us an idea of sort of
maybe what is the price of an EV
right now?
An average cost of an EV right
now in Canada.
>> There is a glaring gap.
Well, whether I'd call it
glaring depends on a lot of
context.
Right now, we're looking at a
2027 Chevrolet Bolt, which
interesting, which
interestingly, has already been
discontinued.
Okay, it's a different subject
entirely, but that is priced at
an MSRP manufacturer's suggested
retail price of just under
40,000 before fees.
That's not that far off, that
35,000 that we're talking about.
And certain provinces and
territories still do offer
rebates.
So there are places in the
country where you can get that
car for cheaper.
So it's not that it doesn't
exist, but it's more that it's
not as widespread as it could
be.
The other aspect of that
storyline is do we immediately
see those cheap EVs coming from
Chinese manufacturers?
Right.
This is something that I spoke
to when the news first broke.
49,000 is not.
It's a drop in the bucket
relative to the Canadian auto
industry in general.
We sell about 1.9 million cars
a year.
So that and the EV portion of
that is about 5%.
So we're talking about roughly
2.5 2.6% of the full market is
what we're bringing in from this
deal from China.
And that's not enough to make
huge waves at any level at this
early stage.
But it does put pressure on
other automakers to to start
bringing those prices down,
which is the rebates were always
meant to just make up for the
fact that EVs were more
expensive initially and were
meant to.
The rebates were meant to be
removed when those prices came
down to be at par with internal
combustion engine vehicles, they
were never meant to be
permanent, right?
Right.
So what this does is sort of
bring those Chinese, those
Chinese EVs in particular back.
They make up that loss and bring
cars back, those EVs back down
to a level where they can
compete directly on price with
internal combustion engine
vehicles.
Will we see immediately those
$35,000 BYDs or Xpeng, those
Chinese brands?
I don't know if that's going to
be an immediate thing, because
you're talking about an
automaker having to come into
the country, set up a head
office, set up a dealership
network.
That takes time, right?
And what some Canadians don't
realise is there are already
Chinese built EVs on Canadian
roads.
Right?
We talk about Chinese EVs in
terms of those brands I just
brought up, but there are
Chinese built EVs that have been
on our roads for a while.
Right?
Tesla, Tesla built, imported
44,000 just Model Ys in 2023.
So that's pretty darn close
to that.
>> 49,000 that we're talking
about, right?
>> One of the things that a few
people have been concerned
about, and I don't know if it's
a genuine concern from from your
expertise, but what worries does
Canada have about Chinese access
to Canadian EV user data that it
doesn't have already with North
American automakers?
Because I think when we talk
about EVs, we jump right to
security concerns.
But there are EVs here in North
America.
North American made that that
potentially could have the same
concerns.
But we don't have those red
flags.
>> I don't know that it's the
fact that it's EVs specifically
that are the discussion point
there.
I think it's more that the cars
are coming from China, and they
have an awful lot of software in
them, a lot of technology in
them.
Interestingly, it's BlackBerry
that actually supplies the
software for BYD.
So there's already a
Canada-China connection there,
and Canada is deeply involved in
that.
So is it tinfoil hat or not?
It's hard to say, but there has
been some discussion of, you
know, really high level national
security things like it's it
sounds crazy, but China has been
accused of putting shut down
operations in, in Chinese built
vehicles so that so that they
would have a way to remotely
just prevent them from.
>> The vehicle from working.
>> Right now, in the
announcement of the the auto
working group, Minister Joly did
address that and said that that
national security concern is on
their radar.
>> All right.
In the last 30 seconds that we
have,
Canada is is still aiming to hit
100% zero emission vehicle sales
by 2025.
Are we going to get there
without made in China electric
vehicles
or is that have to be
part of the equation?
>> I don't think we're going
to get there at all at this
point.
We were supposed to be 20, 20,
20% by 2026
and that got pushed to 2027,
even that,
even with this deal.
Again, we're only talking about
2.6%
of the market here.
That seems very, very unlikely
to get to 100% by 2035.
I mean, that's zero emission
vehicles.
So it can also include plug in
hybrids,
but it seems really, really far
off.
And I would be shocked
if we don't see the Carney
government
pull back on that as part of
this ongoing
discussion situation
as the industry evolves.
But it doesn't
mean it's not a worthwhile goal.
It's whatever point in the
future we can
we can get there.
There's a lot of work to be
done.
There's other aspects to this
discussion,
like charging infrastructure,
convincing Canadians
that they don't need to drive
more than 400 kilometers
on the average day, right?
>> You're not going
picking up and driving to the
Rockies
every week.
Those kinds of mindset changes
are still
they still seem to be a little
ways off
for the average Canadian.
So it's an ongoing discussion
>> Ongoing discussion.
And perhaps
we'll have you back
for another conversation on this
as we get more information and
time.
>> Anytime
>> So thank you so much.
>> My pleasure.
