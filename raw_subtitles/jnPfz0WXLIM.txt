Manoush Zomorodi: Humans, still amazing.
Alvin W. Graylin:
I don’t think we’re replaceable yet.
MZ: No, not yet.
But, Alvin, we're going
to get some straight talk.
To me, for normal people,
this was the year of AI.
And I don't think anyone really knows
what to think right now.
So, Alvin, you have been in this field --
AI, cybersecurity, VR, semiconductors --
35 years you've been doing this.
But what makes you very different
is that it's been both
in the United States,
as a US citizen,
and in China a lot of the time.
I think a lot of people feel
ambivalent about AI.
They feel like, what is actually
really happening,
what is hype
and what is transforming our existence?
Where are we right now according to you?
AWG: I mean, this is one
of the biggest questions
that we have as a society today.
And unfortunately, there's just
a lot of misinformation.
And my answer to you is probably
going to be a little different
than the Silicon Valley consensus,
even though I work at Stanford,
and it's going to be probably
a little scary to a lot of you.
But hopefully, by the end of this,
it will convince you to take action.
Just like what TED,
and the little note I saw in TED,
it says, what action are you going
to take after this event?
We are really at this inflection point
and the inflection point,
not the traditional one
that just keeps going up.
We are essentially at a fork in a road
between three possible futures right now.
One where the big labs
essentially take control
of the government by growing their power
and their resources as much as possible,
then creating essentially a class
of trillionaires and everybody else.
This is kind of the Elysium future
that's ahead of us.
The second option is that actually
we are heading towards a Mad Max future,
where we intensify the conflict
between countries,k
and going from AI race to AI war
to kinetic war and potentially
to nuclear war.
And I've talked to people in DC
who actually see that as "inevitable,"
which is a little scary.
And the third option
that we have right now
is potentially the Star Trek option,
the option where technology
is being used and shared,
and something brings us -- you know,
in the Star Trek stories, essentially,
the Vulcans bring us advanced technology.
Peaceful, rational species brings us
technology and saves us from ourselves
and brings on this century of discovery
or millennia of discovery.
We have a potential to to get there.
Unfortunately, today,
we are heading towards the first two.
And the forces of what's driving it
is actually going to take
a lot of work for us
to move from the first forces
towards the first two,
towards that last one.
MZ: Can we get into that
a little bit more?
Because I think the narrative
we've all been told,
at least certainly by Sam Altman
and maybe some other AI executives,
is that we've got to lock
this technology down,
we've got to grow it,
we've got to grow it fast,
because if we don't, China will.
Would you agree with that?
AWG: That's actually one
of the biggest myths out there,
and actually one of the most
scary things out there.
In fact, two days ago,
I just came back from China.
I've worked there half my career,
and I think essentially,
the AI industry today
is using the same tools
that the military industrial complex
has used over the last century
in terms of you have to create an enemy,
once you do that, then you get funding,
you get support, you get deregulation,
you get to move faster,
and then you get to make money.
And what the AI labs
are actually trying to do
is not to save the world.
It is actually to create billions,
actually trillions of dollars.
In fact, they specifically said
AI is worth trillions of dollars.
And they want to be
the first one to create AGI,
artificial general intelligence.
And it's defined, actually by Sam,
as a technology that can replace
the average worker.
And what that means is
he wants to create a technology
that can take everybody's jobs here.
Now on the surface,
that actually may be scary,
but I think if it's coming
from the right place,
it actually could be an amazing thing
because that means we get liberated
so that we can spend time
doing art and music
and watching, coming to TED.
But, unfortunately,
I think right now there isn't
the other side of the story being put in,
which is how do we protect the people
who are going to be displaced by it?
MZ: OK, so I mean, despite what
we've just talked about so far,
Alvin is actually an optimist.
(Laughter)
He is, I promise.
Explain the vision
that you have come up with
about how we take the right track,
that we take this moment of inflection
and we actually pivot in a good way.
AWG: Yeah, so I actually just turned
in the paper to Stanford,
which is an AI policy paper
about what we need to do going forward
and how we move from today's trajectory
into something better.
And it's a three-piece,
a three-part story,
which sounds simple,
but it's actually very hard to execute.
One is we actually have to decide
that instead of competing over resources
and creating hundreds of labs
around the world,
trying to create, duplicate,
actually, the same work
and having a undersupply of chips
and memory and talent,
rather than doing that,
we need to come together and create
what some people call the CERN of AI.
Essentially a single lab that aggregates
all of the talent around the world.
MZ: Like the space station.
AWG: Like the space station,
like CERN, like the ITER labs that we do,
we've done for other types
of technologies.
It is very doable.
And then whatever comes out of it,
rather than hoarding it
for one company or one country
to do it and share it with the world,
which is the whole idea of open science.
This is what's made progress
in this world happen.
MZ: Woo for open science,
yeah, TED crowd,
alright, nerds, I love it.
AWG: Yes.
And then two, is that we need
to put together everybody's data
from around the world
so that we're not creating --
in fact, the thing that a lot of people
want to do today is create "sovereign AI"
which means an AI that works
for your country, culture
and represents you.
And it essentially is a subset
of data feeding into it.
And it sounds like, OK, that's good,
because I have something on my side.
But what data right now,
what research is showing
is that the less you give data,
the more biased these AI become.
And what we really need to do
is to make sure
that the entire world's data,
all of our history, all of our languages
are represented, all of the culture,
because then the AI can come in
and create an optimal for everyone,
that there is a way to find a way
to balance everybody's needs
without taking other people down.
MZ: So how are we going
to convince people to do this,
technologists, governments,
to go along with this?
AWG: That's the hard part, I think.
The thing is, we need to understand
or we need them to understand,
that the world is not zero sum,
and that actually by working together,
it's not weakness.
Working together
is enlightened self-interest.
Because when you work together,
you actually raise everybody up.
And when you raise everybody up,
there's a lot less reason
to have conflict,
a lot less reason to have my children
fly 10,000 miles around the world
to kill your children.
Why would I need that
when I have everything around me
from this technology
that’s going to give us.
Because this is amazing technology.
It's going to solve cancer,
it is going to bring us
better energy sources,
it's going to solve hunger,
all these things.
But we have to choose
to share with the world,
and we have to choose
to use it for humanity's good,
not for one country's good.
But there was a third part to the plan.
MZ: Sorry.
AWG: The third part of the plan is
something called
the GI Bill for the AI age.
So why do I say that?
Because in 1944-45,
there was about 15 million
American service people
coming back from World War II,
and they were going to create a giant
employment shock to the world
because they're going to come in,
they're going to be unemployed.
What did America decide to do?
The government says,
we're going to give you free education,
we're going to give you
zero-interest loans,
free medical,
and then we're going to help you,
essentially, buy homes,
because that's what's needed
for people to have secure lives.
And it created the American middle class.
It created a boom in our economy
and turned us into what we are today,
which is the most successful
and most powerful nation in the world.
We can do that again,
but not for 15 million people,
maybe for 150 million people,
maybe for 1.5 billion people.
Because America has 170 million workers,
and the displacements that we are seeing
is going to be the proportions
that people are predicting.
It could get to 100-plus million people
affected just in this country.
And globally, it will be
billions of people.
And we have to take care of them.
Because if we don’t,
this world not going to be
a very good place for us to hang out in.
MZ: OK, that's a lot to take in.
(Laughter)
I do want to give us
something actionable, right.
Because it can feel like,
oh, this AI thing is happening
to us and that it's inevitable,
but what can we do?
Like when we walk out of here.
AWG: I think what you need to do
is actually to start
to change your mindset,
to start to understand
that the world is not zero-sum.
And you actually have a responsibility
as business owners,
most of you guys own businesses
or work in very senior
positions in businesses.
You need to see about how
does your company integrate AI,
not in a way to replace people,
but in a way to make
things more efficient.
And rather than saying,
I'm going to lay off
30 percent of my staff,
which some companies are doing,
recently I've talked to 50 companies
in the last two months
about how they were implementing,
a lot of them are saying,
I'm going to just replace my people.
Giving them four-day workweeks,
or reskilling to other places,
we need to reduce the shock
of what this technology is going to do
to our society.
The prior industrial revolutions took 80,
60 and 40 years to play out.
This one is going to happen
in the next five to 10 years,
maybe shorter,
and our society is not equipped
to move at that speed.
MZ: So play with the models,
see what they're like,
know what these companies
are talking about.
Do you recommend that?
AWG: Oh, you have to do it.
You have to actually use these models,
because you’ll hear people say,
oh, this thing is not that scary,
this thing will never replace humans.
The reality is, the more you use,
the more you understand
how powerful they are
and how quickly
they're changing every day,
and if you don't use it,
you won't understand it.
MZ: Alvin Graylin, thanks for giving us
a glimpse into our future.
AWG: Thank you, Manoush.
(Applause)
