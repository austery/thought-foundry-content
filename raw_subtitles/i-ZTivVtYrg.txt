Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 Odd
 Thoughts
 podcast.
 I'm
 Tracy


Aloway


and
 I'm
 Joe
 Weisenthal.
 Joe,
 do
 you
 ever


experience
 a
 sudden
 surge
 in


geopolitical
 analysis
 emails
 in
 your


inbox?


Yes,
 I
 do.
 You
 know,
 it's
 funny.
 Most


years
 people
 like,
 what
 do
 you,
 you


know,
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 year,
 end
 of


the
 year,
 things
 are
 going
 good,
 and


it's
 like,
 what
 are
 you
 concerned
 about?


It's
 like,
 I'm
 concerned
 about


geopolitical
 tension.


It's
 just
 one
 of
 these
 clich.


That's
 what
 I
 always
 say
 when
 I
 have
 no


it's
 like,
 well,
 things
 seem
 fine,
 but


I'm
 concerned.
 But
 then
 some
 years


clearly
 geopolitical
 tension,
 war
 etc.


is
 very
 real.
 We
 recently
 saw
 the


bombing
 in
 both
 directions
 between


Israel
 and
 Iran.
 That
 seems
 to
 be
 paused


for
 now.
 But
 sometimes
 geopolitical


attention
 becomes
 outright
 geopolitical


hostility.


Yeah,
 that
 was
 definitely
 one
 of
 those


weeks
 when
 we
 both
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 emails.


I
 have
 a
 confession
 to
 make,
 which
 is
 I


read
 all
 of
 those
 geopolitical
 analyses,


but
 I
 always
 kind
 of
 wonder
 what
 I'm


supposed
 to
 do
 with
 that
 information.


You
 know,
 if
 I
 were
 a
 major
 professional


investor,
 if
 I'm
 reading
 a
 note
 about


what
 is
 the
 base
 case
 for
 like
 Iran


versus
 Israel,


I
 am
 not
 entirely
 sure
 how
 that


influences
 my
 own
 decision-making.
 Well,


I
 would
 say
 I
 would
 take
 it
 even
 a
 step


backwards
 and
 say
 like,
 you
 know,
 when


we
 talk
 to
 Wall
 Street
 analysts,
 say
 a


Fed
 forecaster,
 I
 have
 a
 sort
 of
 I
 think


intuitive
 understanding
 of
 how
 they


they're
 like,
 "Oh,
 there's
 going
 to
 be


three
 cuts
 in
 the
 next
 year."
 And
 then
 I


generally
 have
 a
 sort
 of
 intuitive


understanding
 of
 how
 they
 might
 arrive


at
 that.
 Okay.
 We
 look
 at
 statements


from
 the
 Fed
 about
 what
 they're
 looking


for
 in
 terms
 of
 achieving
 disinflation.


We
 look
 at
 the
 trajectory
 of
 the
 US


economy
 and
 then
 we
 say
 okay
 we
 combine


the
 Fed
 statement
 their
 sensitivity
 etc


the
 reaction
 function
 that's
 the
 term


I'm
 looking
 for
 with
 the
 data
 and
 then


we
 arrive
 at
 a
 forecast
 when
 it
 comes
 to


something
 like
 a
 war
 I
 do
 not
 really


have
 an
 intuitive
 understanding
 of
 how


the
 geostrategic
 or
 geopolitical


analysts
 whose
 notes
 flood
 our
 inboxes


from
 time
 to
 time
 always
 during
 bad


periods
 how
 do
 they
 arrive
 at


conclusions
 therefore
 X
 we
 think
 the
 the


war
 is
 going
 to
 end
 this
 way.
 I
 do
 not


know
 how
 that
 can
 be
 done
 systematically


and
 yet
 people
 try.


And
 actually
 some
 of
 them
 put
 numbers


probabilities
 on
 specific
 outcomes.
 So
 I


think
 if
 I
 was
 a
 geopolitical
 analyst
 I


would
 just
 put
 30%
 chance
 on
 everything.


That
 seems
 reasonable.


Yeah.
 So
 it
 used
 to
 be
 that
 if
 you
 were


unsure
 but
 wanted
 to
 sound
 smart,
 you


say
 6040.
 But
 these
 days
 you
 say
 70.


7030
 is
 the
 new
 6040.


That's
 right.
 That's
 right.


But
 I
 you
 know
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be


cynical
 about
 it.
 I
 am
 curious
 about
 how


one
 could
 derive
 a
 number
 from
 things


that
 seem
 wildly
 uncertain
 and
 rare


because
 there
 are
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 event


studies
 and
 every
 war
 is
 distinct
 and


therefore
 the
 idea
 of
 trying
 to


accurately
 assess
 the
 outcome
 of
 some


conflict
 strikes
 me
 as
 very
 difficult.


Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 am
 very
 pleased
 to
 say


that
 we
 do
 in
 fact
 have
 the
 perfect


guest
 to
 talk
 about
 geopolitical


analysis
 and
 how
 it
 actually
 is


calculated
 I
 guess
 or
 created.
 We
 are


going
 to
 speak
 with
 Andrew
 Bishop.
 He
 is


a
 senior
 partner
 and
 global
 head
 of


policy
 research
 at
 Signnum
 Global


Advisors.
 So
 Andrew,
 welcome
 to
 the


show.


Hi,
 thanks
 for
 having
 me.


Why
 don't
 we
 just
 start
 with
 what
 is


Signnum?


So
 Signnum
 is
 a
 political
 and


geopolitical
 risk
 advisory
 firm
 that
 was


founded
 in
 2018
 by
 a
 gentleman
 named


Charles
 Meyers
 who
 was
 the
 vice
 chairman


of
 Evercore
 ISI
 before
 founding
 Signnum.


And
 Charles
 had
 a
 career
 in
 banking
 with


a
 focus
 on
 emerging
 markets,
 but
 was


always
 sort
 of
 one
 foot
 in
 US
 politics


as
 a
 fundraiser,
 as
 an
 adviser
 to


candidates,
 etc.
 And
 he
 founded
 Signum


essentially
 to
 try
 to
 meld
 his
 instincts


about
 how
 markets
 work
 with
 his


knowledge
 about
 US
 politics.
 And
 from


there,
 he
 hired
 me
 to
 help
 build
 out
 the


sort
 of
 global
 analysis
 beyond
 the
 US.


So,
 I
 think
 I
 started
 first
 becoming


aware
 of
 your
 commentary
 recently


because
 uh
 Ozan
 Tarman,
 who
 we've
 had
 on


the
 podcast
 over
 at
 Deutsche
 Bank,
 he


started
 forwarding
 some
 of
 your
 notes


over
 and
 so
 then
 I
 started
 reading
 the


stuff
 and
 it
 was
 like
 very
 interesting


and
 compelling.
 But
 why
 don't
 you
 tell


us
 okay
 you
 explained
 what
 signum
 is,


what's
 your
 background,
 how
 do
 you


develop
 an
 expertise
 in
 these
 areas.
 So


I
 joined
 Signnum
 from
 Eurasia
 Group
 uh


which
 is
 sort
 of
 the
 you
 know
 the
 the


founding
 house
 of
 of
 political
 risk.
 I


was
 there
 for
 four
 years.
 I
 first
 joined


Eurasia
 because
 I'd
 met
 Ian
 Bremer


through
 a
 previous
 job
 at
 the
 World


Economic
 Forum.
 So
 at
 the
 Davos


organization
 and
 I
 joined
 as
 sort
 of


right-hand
 man
 to
 their
 chairman
 Cliff


Cupchin
 who
 really
 taught
 me
 a
 lot
 in


that
 firm
 in
 that
 role.
 I
 ended
 up
 as


deputy
 head
 of
 research
 and
 several
 of


the
 things
 that
 I
 learned
 from
 Cliff


were
 for
 example
 not
 getting
 overly


excited
 by
 every
 new
 headline.
 Right.
 So


I
 think
 when
 especially
 when
 you're
 at


the
 beginning
 of
 your
 journey


advice
 for
 everyone.


Yes.
 I
 mean
 to
 me
 the
 best
 example
 of


that
 is
 the
 zero
 hedge
 type
 headline


about
 how
 the
 first
 gas
 contract
 was


denominated
 or
 settled
 in
 euro
 instead


of
 dollar


you
 know
 or
 or
 just
 the
 bricks
 more


generally.
 I
 I
 you
 started
 working
 when


I
 was
 22.
 I'm
 39
 now.
 the
 bricks
 have


had
 a
 glorious
 future
 for
 you
 know


almost
 20
 years.
 So
 that
 was
 one
 of the


things.
 The
 other
 thing
 that
 I
 learned


from
 Cliff
 was
 good
 analysis.
 Like


basically
 the
 key
 is
 to
 have
 a
 rigorous


and
 an analytical
 process
 and
 even
 if


you
 get
 the
 call
 wrong,
 it's
 better
 to


have
 good
 analysis
 and
 a
 call
 wrong


rather
 than
 the
 other
 way
 around.
 Right?


Because
 otherwise
 you
 could
 just
 be


throwing
 darts
 and
 you
 you'd
 be
 getting


elections,
 you
 know,
 50%
 right
 half
 the


time.
 Right.
 Which
 by
 the
 way
 gets
 to


this
 question
 of
 of
 what
 you
 mentioned


on
 on
 the
 the
 probabilities.
 It's


actually
 harder
 than
 just
 throwing
 darts


or
 flipping
 a
 coin
 because
 most


situations
 have
 far
 more
 than
 two


scenarios,
 right?
 So
 it
 really
 is
 a
 very


very
 difficult
 thing
 to
 do
 to
 predict


all
 geopolitical
 outcomes
 which
 which


I'm
 sure
 we'll
 get
 to.
 But
 just
 to
 to


close
 off
 on
 on
 you
 know
 sort
 of


background,
 I
 joined
 Eurasia
 from
 from


the
 World
 Economic
 Forum
 and
 the
 job
 I


had
 there
 was
 really
 fun
 because


essentially
 you
 know
 the
 the


organization
 is
 best
 known
 for
 Davos.


But
 the
 team
 I
 was
 in
 which
 was
 their


global
 risk
 team
 basically
 send
 their


team
 members
 throughout
 most
 frontier


and
 emerging
 markets
 to
 meet
 with


government
 officials,
 get
 a
 sense
 of


where
 their
 head
 was
 at
 in
 terms
 of


their
 country's
 sort
 of
 economic
 future,


future
 economic
 policies,
 etc.
 then
 meet


with
 the
 opposition
 and
 the
 business


community
 and
 think
 tank
 community
 and


essentially
 write
 up
 scenarios
 about
 the


future
 of
 that
 country
 at
 a
 sort
 of
 10


to
 20
 year
 outlook.
 Not
 trying
 to
 get
 it


right,
 not
 trying
 to
 predict
 it,
 but


trying
 to
 essentially
 force
 the
 country


to
 think
 twice
 about
 its
 business
 model.


As
 you
 can
 imagine,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 were


resource
 dependent
 countries.
 And
 that


led
 to
 some
 pretty
 interesting


situations.
 Like
 one
 of
 the
 projects
 we


worked
 on,
 for example,
 was
 about
 the


future
 of
 Ukraine.
 And
 that
 was
 in
 2013


2014.
 So
 the
 project
 was
 literally


interrupted
 by
 the
 Maidan
 revolution.


Half
 the
 people
 on
 the
 board
 of
 the


project
 and
 half
 the
 people
 we


interviewed
 were
 you
 know
 either
 fleeing


or
 put
 in
 prison
 and
 I
 remember
 we
 were


doing
 a
 a
 panel
 to
 to
 actually
 introduce


parts
 of
 the
 findings
 in
 Davos
 and
 the


prime
 minister
 of
 Ukraine
 his
 plane
 was


he
 was
 basically
 disinvited
 on
 the
 day


that
 the
 panel
 was
 taking
 place.
 So
 his


plane
 was
 circling
 over
 Zurich,
 not


being
 allowed
 to
 land,
 not
 being
 allowed


into
 the
 room.
 You
 know,
 similarly,
 we


had
 back
 then
 he
 was
 an
 MP
 uh
 Petro


Porchenko
 who
 later
 became
 the
 leader
 of


the
 country,
 smuggled
 in
 a
 grenade
 from


the
 Maidan
 revolutions
 into
 the


conference
 hall
 and
 sort
 of
 held
 it
 up


to
 show
 how
 the
 brutality
 of
 the
 regime


was
 working.
 So
 it
 was
 a
 really
 great


way
 to
 get
 firsthand
 exposure
 to
 to


frontier
 markets.


Yeah,
 that
 is
 definitely
 firsthand


exposure.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 how
 I
 would
 feel


being
 in
 a
 conference
 room
 or
 like
 a
 big


hall
 with
 a
 grenade.
 I'm
 hoping
 it


wasn't
 live,
 but
 who
 knows?
 Okay,


Andrew,
 one
 thing
 I
 want
 to
 ask,
 and
 I


alluded
 to
 it
 in
 the
 intro,
 is
 when
 I


get
 your
 research
 notes,
 if
 I
 am
 a


typical
 client
 of
 Signnum,
 what
 exactly


am
 I
 doing
 with
 that
 information,
 why
 do


I
 want
 to
 get
 this
 analysis?
 So
 first


thing
 is
 about
 60
 65%
 of
 our
 clients
 are


financial
 investors,
 right?
 That
 Joe


mentioned
 or
 or
 alluded
 to.
 Uh
 about
 35%


or
 so
 are
 corporates
 and
 they
 obviously


use
 us
 in
 very
 different
 ways
 which
 I'll


I'll
 get
 into.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 first


topic
 that
 you
 all
 sort
 of
 touched
 on
 is


is
 this
 idea,
 you
 know,
 there's
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 studies
 that
 show
 that


geopolitical
 risks
 just
 don't
 affect


markets,
 right?
 Like
 who
 really
 cares?


Frankly,
 oil's
 pretty
 much
 flat
 from


pre-Israel
 Iran
 war.
 VIX
 barely
 picked


up.
 You
 know,
 S&P's
 at
 all-time
 highs.


etc.
 Obviously,
 I
 have
 a,
 you
 know,
 a


bias
 or
 I'm
 I'm
 rooting
 for
 my
 own
 team


here,
 but
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 a
 little


bit
 short-sighted
 for
 a
 few
 reasons.
 One


is
 most
 of
 these
 studies
 typically
 look


at
 S&P
 in
 the
 long
 term.
 And
 our
 clients


obviously
 are
 not
 trading
 the
 S&P
 in
 the


long
 term,
 right?
 They're
 trading
 in
 the


short
 term.
 And
 you've
 got
 some
 pretty


violent
 sharp
 moves
 up
 and
 down
 for
 a


lot
 of
 these
 assets.
 And
 they're
 also


trading
 obviously
 more
 niche
 assets.
 So


I'm
 thinking
 of
 the
 travel
 and
 tourism


industry
 or
 I'm
 thinking
 of
 the
 oil
 and


gas
 industry,
 Israeli
 shekele,
 you
 know,


things
 that
 are
 far
 more
 niche.
 And
 if


you
 look
 at
 it
 at
 that
 level,
 you've
 got


some
 major
 major
 volatility
 that
 can
 be


both
 beneficial
 or
 or
 negative
 depending


on
 on
 how
 good
 you
 are
 at
 at
 playing
 it,


which
 is
 really
 what
 our
 our
 clients
 are


specialists
 in.
 We're
 not
 strategists,


so
 we
 don't
 give
 investment
 advice
 based


on
 the
 geopolitical
 research
 we
 put
 out.


The
 other
 thing
 is
 there's
 this
 big,
 you


know,
 talking
 point
 and
 it
 was
 true


again
 last
 month
 or
 two
 weeks
 ago


whenever
 um
 uh
 the
 Israel
 Iran
 war


ended.
 There's
 sort
 of
 this
 like
 oil


collapses,
 right?
 And
 that's
 a


counterintuitive
 outcome.
 A
 lot
 of
 our


clients
 were
 actually
 expecting
 that.


And
 so
 what
 they
 were
 trying
 to
 figure


out
 was
 when
 is
 this
 going
 to
 end
 or
 not


end,
 but
 when
 is
 it
 going
 to
 culminate,


right?
 When
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 peak
 fear


level?
 And
 that's
 probably
 going
 to
 be


when
 Iran
 retaliates
 for
 whatever
 the
 US


does.
 So
 again,
 the
 fact
 that
 it


actually
 drops
 on
 the
 news
 is
 not


necessarily
 surprising
 to
 to
 most
 of
 the


folks
 we
 we
 speak
 to.
 But
 Tracy,
 do
 you


want
 me
 to
 get
 into
 a
 little
 bit
 how
 the


clients
 use
 us?


Yes,
 that
 would
 be
 great.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 so
 there's
 a
 few
 ways.
 The


first
 and
 I
 would
 say
 least
 often
 and


and
 least
 sort
 of
 savvy
 or
 useful
 way
 is


for
 the
 predictions
 themselves,
 right?


So
 what
 I'm
 saying
 is
 basically
 most


clients
 don't
 use
 us
 for
 the
 actual


outcome
 prediction.
 It's
 better
 if
 we


get
 it
 right.
 But
 if
 they
 were
 only


going
 to
 use
 us
 for
 that,
 they
 could


probably
 go
 to
 prediction
 markets,


right?
 I
 think
 they're
 prediction


markets
 are
 a
 little
 bit
 overestimated


these
 days,
 which
 we
 can
 get
 into,
 but


they're
 not
 bad,
 right?


Interesting.


Yeah.
 So,
 so
 the
 the
 that's
 not
 the
 main


reason.
 The
 main
 reason
 that
 the
 way


that
 a
 client
 put
 it
 to
 me,
 and
 this
 was


years
 ago,
 and
 it
 stuck,
 is
 like
 they're


an
 F1
 driver,
 and
 we're
 helping
 them
 on


the
 sort
 of,
 you
 know,
 the
 training


tracks,
 right?
 like
 on
 the
 on
 the
 the


training
 loops
 before
 the
 actual
 race
 to


literally
 memorize
 every
 single
 turn
 and


know
 when
 they
 can
 accelerate,
 when


they've
 got
 to
 cut
 a
 corner,
 etc.
 So


that
 when
 the
 events
 start
 unfolding,


they're
 already
 prepared
 to,
 you
 know,


hit
 the
 brakes
 or
 accelerate
 depending


on
 what's
 happening.
 The
 difference


here,
 of
 course,
 is
 that
 the
 track
 is


not
 fixed.
 But
 the
 point
 is,
 you
 know,


in
 a
 situation
 like
 Israel,
 Iran,
 you've


got
 multiple
 calls,
 right?
 Or
 multiple


call
 basically
 just
 means
 prediction.


You've
 got
 multiple
 situations.
 So


you've
 got
 is
 Israel
 going
 to
 strike?


Then
 you've
 got
 the
 question,
 okay,
 so


we
 know
 they're
 striking.
 It's
 all
 over


Twitter,
 etc.
 Is
 this
 a
 shot
 across
 the


bow
 or
 is
 this
 the
 big
 one?
 Is
 the
 US


actually
 going
 to
 get
 involved
 after
 12


hours?
 Is
 Iran
 going
 to
 retaliate


forcefully
 or
 in
 a,
 you
 know,
 symbolic


way?
 Is
 this
 war
 going
 to
 last
 3
 days
 or


is
 it
 going
 to
 last
 3
 weeks?
 Is
 the
 US


going
 to
 get
 involved
 at
 that
 point?
 You


know,
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so
 forth.
 And
 so


they're
 not
 like
 most
 clients
 don't


expect
 us
 to
 get
 every
 single
 one
 of


those
 calls
 right.
 I
 mean,
 that
 would
 be


insane.
 What
 they
 want
 is
 for
 us
 to
 lay


out
 arguments
 that
 are
 not
 necessarily


just
 convincing,
 but
 that
 help
 them
 do


the
 the
 mental
 gymnastics
 around
 all
 the


possible
 outcomes.
 And
 then,
 of
 course,


it's
 better
 if
 you
 get
 it
 right.


Wait,
 I
 have
 a
 very
 short
 quick


question.
 Do
 you
 see
 anyone
 in
 your


clients
 who
 are
 actually
 in
 the


prediction
 markets
 looking
 for


opportunity
 there
 yet?
 Because
 some
 of


these
 are
 getting
 to
 be
 big
 size
 and
 or


do
 you
 see
 this
 as
 a
 future
 growth
 area


for
 you?
 people
 looking
 for
 mispriced


contracts
 on
 the
 prediction
 markets.


So
 you
 mean
 clients
 that
 would
 actually


be
 putting
 on
 trades?


Yeah.
 You
 say
 there's
 40%
 of
 X


happening,
 the
 prediction
 market
 is
 60%.


Maybe
 there's
 an
 opportunity.
 Anyone


doing
 that
 yet?


So
 short
 answer
 is
 that
 I'm
 aware
 of
 no.


And
 the
 main
 reason
 is
 still
 liquidity


despite
 the
 fact
 that
 it's
 getting


bigger
 as
 you
 say.


What's
 really
 interesting
 of
 course
 is


that
 that
 would
 disintermediate
 the


market's
 reaction
 function.


[Music]


So,
 I'm
 looking
 back
 at
 a
 note.
 This
 is


just
 a
 random
 one
 that
 I
 found
 in
 my


inbox,
 but
 there
 were
 several
 that
 I


read
 in
 July
 or
 sorry,


in
 June.


In
 June.
 By
 the
 way,
 I
 should
 say
 we
 are


recording
 this
 on
 July
 1st.
 And
 given


that
 the
 world
 is
 an
 uncertain
 place
 by


the
 time
 this
 episode
 comes,
 and
 I
 don't


know
 the
 exact
 date,
 who
 knows
 what's


going
 to
 happen
 by
 the
 time
 you're


listening
 to
 this,
 but
 I'm
 reading
 a


June
 16th
 note,
 and
 you
 gave
 these
 odds.


20%
 preemptive
 Iranian
 capitulation,
 45%


Israeli
 mission
 accomplished,
 followed


by
 Iranian
 capitulation,
 25%
 chance
 US


intervention,
 and
 10%
 Iranian
 nuclear


breakout
 surprise.
 Why
 don't
 you
 go
 give


us
 through
 your
 thinking
 in
 the
 middle


of
 June,
 how
 you
 arrived
 at
 some
 of


these
 numbers
 and
 then
 given
 where
 we


are
 today
 on
 uh
 July
 1st,
 how
 did
 you
 do


uh
 or
 what
 surprised
 you
 or
 what
 didn't


surprise
 you?
 Talk
 about
 sort
 of
 where


you
 were
 then
 and
 where
 you
 are
 today.


So
 the
 first
 thing
 is
 Tracy
 was
 asking


about
 how
 do
 we
 ascribe
 probabilities


and
 there's
 I
 I
 could
 give
 you
 a
 fancy


answer
 about
 Monte
 Carlo
 simulations


etc.
 But
 the
 reality
 is
 neither
 we
 nor


as
 far
 as
 I'm
 aware
 anyone
 in
 the
 sort


of
 market
 actually
 models
 this
 stuff
 and


the
 few
 that
 do
 use
 predictive
 analytics


rather
 than
 historical
 data.
 And
 the


reason
 is
 there
 just
 aren't
 that
 many


case
 studies
 to
 go
 off
 of.
 Right?
 So


let's
 just
 get
 that
 out
 of
 the
 way.


So
 the
 the
 way
 we
 use
 probabilities
 and


I'll
 I'll
 absolutely
 answer
 your


question
 about
 the
 that
 specific
 case


study
 in
 a
 second.
 Sure.


But
 there
 are
 three
 main
 ways
 that
 I


think
 the
 probabilities
 can
 be
 useful.


The
 first
 is
 if
 you're
 drawing
 out


scenario
 trees
 and
 you're
 assigning


prob,
 you
 know,
 before
 you
 publish,


right?
 You're
 assigning
 probabilities
 to


various
 sub
 events
 before
 getting
 to
 the


total
 cumulative
 outcome.
 Basically,
 if


the
 math
 doesn't
 add
 up,
 that
 can


highlight
 a
 problem
 in
 your
 logic,


right?
 It's
 not
 a
 math
 problem.
 Who


cares
 if
 the
 math
 doesn't
 add
 up
 from
 a


mathematical
 standpoint?
 But
 if
 you
 end


up
 with
 above
 100
 or
 below
 100
 or


whatever,
 that
 means
 that
 you're


probably
 overstating
 one
 aspect
 of
 the


of
 the
 dynamic
 or
 understating
 another.


That's
 one.
 A
 second
 that
 can
 be
 quite


interesting
 and
 problem,
 you
 know,
 not


problematic
 but
 useful
 for
 the
 user
 is


clustering.
 Right?
 So
 we
 had
 a
 recent


scenario
 or
 recent
 situation
 with
 an


election
 I
 think
 it
 was
 in
 Uruguay
 where


the
 base
 case
 was
 perhaps
 market


constructive
 but
 if
 you
 aggregated
 all


the
 non-base
 case
 scenarios
 you
 actually


had
 a
 more
 likely
 outcome
 of
 a
 market


negative
 bottom
 line
 right
 so
 that's


those
 are
 a
 few
 of
 the
 ways
 now
 the
 way


that
 I
 would
 approach
 a
 situation
 like


the
 Israel
 Iran
 one
 is
 basically
 break


it
 down
 into
 an
 equation
 so
 if
 you're


trying
 to
 answer
 the
 question
 is
 the
 US


going
 to
 intervene
 in
 the
 war
 and
 bomb


for
 right.


Yeah.


To
 me,
 the
 odds
 of
 that
 would
 be
 you


start
 with
 100
 and
 then
 you
 take
 out


whatever
 the
 odds
 are
 that
 Iran
 is
 going


to
 capitulate
 at
 the
 diplomatic
 table.


So,
 you
 know,
 we
 can
 talk
 about
 how
 how


you
 can
 come
 up
 with
 that
 view,
 but
 the


idea
 is
 are
 the
 Iranians
 going
 to
 take


the
 diplomatic
 offramp
 that
 Trump
 is


giving
 them
 on
 that
 Friday
 in
 Geneva,


right?
 So,
 those
 odds
 might
 be
 low,
 but


they're
 not
 zero.
 So,
 you
 get
 to
 say


20%.
 Now
 that
 leaves
 you
 with
 80%.
 Of


that
 the
 question
 becomes
 is
 Israel


going
 to
 basically
 finish
 the
 job
 on
 its


own
 right
 i.e.
 can
 the
 Israelis


destroy
 Ford
 on
 their
 own
 either
 through


bombing
 without
 the
 most
 advanced
 bunker


busters
 or
 through
 a
 ground
 operation


like
 they
 conducted
 in
 Syria
 the


previous
 November
 which
 is
 something


that
 I
 and
 a
 few
 others
 had
 on
 on
 their


radar.
 And
 if
 they
 can't
 then
 presumably


the
 president
 will
 will
 intervene.
 Right


now,
 you
 were
 asking
 about
 scoring


myself.
 That's
 a
 perfect
 example.
 Those


odds
 get
 you
 below
 50%
 of
 US


intervention.
 You
 on
 top
 of
 that
 have
 to


add
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 president
 might


want
 to
 intervene
 even
 if
 he
 doesn't


have
 to,
 right?
 Because
 you
 might
 see


political
 opportunity
 and
 being


associated
 with
 a
 victory.
 And
 that's


the
 part
 that
 in
 this
 instance,
 for


example,
 I'
 I'd
 underestimated.


Now,
 where
 it
 gets
 really
 interesting,


and
 I'll
 stop
 here.
 What
 gets
 really


interesting
 is
 even
 if
 your
 take
 is
 that


the
 president
 is
 actually
 not
 dying
 to


get
 involved
 and
 that
 he
 doesn't
 really


see
 this
 as
 a
 big
 opportunity
 and
 you


therefore
 only
 ascribe
 it,
 you
 know,


whatever
 30%
 odds,
 you're
 still
 going
 to


end
 up
 above
 50%
 overall.


So
 that
 can
 tell
 you
 that
 because
 there


are
 so
 many
 ways
 of
 getting
 to
 an


outcome,
 you
 can
 get
 tipped
 over
 50


without
 it
 being
 your
 your
 modal


scenario.
 And
 same
 with
 odds
 of
 regime


change.
 You
 can
 get
 regime
 change


through
 a
 palis
 coup.
 You
 can
 get
 regime


change
 through
 Israeli
 bombing.
 You
 can


get
 regime
 change
 through
 a
 revolution.


Our
 base
 case
 was
 that
 there
 would
 be
 no


regime
 change
 in
 Iran.
 And
 I
 think


that's
 that's
 what
 played
 out
 so
 far.


But
 the
 point
 is
 you
 got
 to
 compound
 all


those
 odds
 because
 they're
 independent


variables.


Okay.
 You
 have
 the
 probabilities.
 I
 get


that
 the
 way
 you
 just
 laid
 it
 out
 was


very
 clear.
 But
 how
 do
 you
 actually
 come


up
 with
 I
 guess
 the
 range
 of
 scenarios


because
 that's
 what
 seems
 practically


unlimited
 nowadays.
 And
 also
 you


mentioned
 Trump
 just
 then
 in
 Trump
 world


I
 kind
 of
 feel
 like
 anything
 is
 possible


right
 like
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 more
 tale


risks
 out
 there
 that
 now
 seem
 you
 know


plausible
 in
 various
 ways.
 How
 do
 you


take
 into
 account
 the
 unpredictability


of
 anything
 can
 happen
 and
 then
 how
 do


you
 actually
 confine
 yourself
 to
 this
 is


a
 set
 of
 realistic
 scenarios
 that
 I'm


going
 to
 talk
 about.
 So,
 first
 thing
 I'd


say
 is
 to
 me
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 reasons


why
 prediction
 markets
 aren't
 that


useful
 yet
 and
 especially
 to
 to
 clients.


They
 can
 actually
 be
 ironically
 more


useful
 I
 think
 to
 the
 analyst
 than
 than


to
 the
 recipient
 or
 user
 of
 the
 final


product.
 And
 what
 I
 mean
 by
 that
 is
 the


prediction
 markets
 will
 tell
 you
 where


the
 tariff
 level
 is
 going
 to
 end
 up
 on


July
 31st,
 right?
 But
 what
 if
 the
 cutoff


that's
 relevant
 is
 not
 July
 31st?
 what


if
 it's,
 you
 know,
 a
 completely


different
 date
 because
 Trump
 is
 visiting


like
 let's
 say
 that
 it's
 it's
 a


ceasefire
 in
 Gaza
 and
 the
 cutoff
 date
 is


Trump's
 visit
 to
 Saudi
 Arabia
 or


whatever.
 So
 the
 point
 is
 the
 rigidity


of
 the
 prediction
 markets
 and
 it's
 a


trade-off,
 right?
 Because
 the
 the
 reason


they
 do
 them
 that
 way
 is
 so
 that
 they


can
 be
 easily
 falsifiable
 and
 you
 can


compare
 predictions
 etc.
 But
 that


rigidity
 I
 think
 narrows
 the
 value.
 So


then
 to
 your
 question
 on
 how
 do
 you
 even


frame
 the
 frame
 the
 issue
 that's
 a
 major


problem
 for
 Trump
 tariff
 situations


indeed.
 So
 if
 you
 take
 July
 8
 for


example
 you
 can't
 really
 and
 and
 we've


you
 know
 we've
 struggled
 with
 this


everyone
 does
 it's
 hard
 to
 make
 a
 call


on
 whether
 he
 is
 going
 to
 escalate
 or


postpone
 his
 deadline
 because
 there
 are


60
 countries
 involved.
 So
 first
 of
 all


you
 theoretically
 would
 have
 to
 make
 60


individual
 calls
 right
 or
 predictions.


Second
 thing
 is
 what
 if
 he
 says,
 you


know,
 we're
 escalating
 the
 tariffs,
 but


they're
 kicking
 in
 on
 July
 15th.
 Is
 that


a
 punt
 or
 is
 that
 him
 actually
 having


increased
 the
 tariffs
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so


forth?
 So,
 I
 mean,
 the
 short
 answer,


Tracy,
 is
 there
 is
 no
 perfect
 way
 of


doing
 it.
 And
 that's
 actually
 been
 one


of the
 issues
 with
 Trump
 is
 that
 framing


the
 initial
 question
 is
 almost
 as
 hard


as
 predicting
 his
 behavior.
 Trade,


ironically,
 is
 one
 of
 those
 situations


though
 that
 we've
 had
 a
 pretty
 good


track
 record
 with.
 So
 I'm
 happy
 to
 talk


a
 little
 bit
 about
 how
 we've
 tried
 to


like
 get
 into
 Trump's
 brain
 if
 you
 want.


Please.


Yeah.
 So
 there
 are
 a
 few
 things.
 So
 the


first
 is
 you
 can
 observe
 patterns,


right?
 So
 Robert
 Armstrong
 had
 sort
 of


this
 huge
 success
 with
 the
 taco
 label.


That
 was
 amazing
 marketing,
 but
 I
 have


to
 say
 we
 were
 a
 little
 jealous
 because


I
 think
 he
 wrote
 that
 in
 early
 May
 and


in
 early
 April
 we
 put
 out
 a
 table
 with


basically
 every
 one
 of
 the
 Trump


threats.
 I
 think
 there
 were
 like
 23
 or


so.


Doesn't
 matter
 if
 you
 don't
 market
 it.


It's
 all
 about
 that.
 It's
 all
 about
 that


acronym.
 Anyway,
 keep
 going.


I
 I
 was
 waiting
 for
 the
 invite.
 Um,
 so
 I


think
 Trump
 had
 backed
 down
 in
 21
 out
 of


23
 threats
 or
 something
 like
 that,


right?
 So,
 the
 first
 thing
 is
 you
 can


identify
 patterns.
 And
 in
 fact,


actually,
 truth
 be
 told,
 we
 we
 ran
 that


same
 study
 at
 the
 very
 end
 of
 his
 first


term
 as
 well.
 And
 the
 takeaway
 was
 very


very
 similar.
 The
 question
 I
 think
 was,


was
 he
 going
 to
 be
 tougher
 his
 second


time
 around?
 Right?
 But
 the
 point
 is,


you
 can
 identify
 patterns.
 So,
 Taco
 is


one
 of
 them.
 Where
 it
 gets
 complicated


though
 is,
 you
 know,
 it's
 almost
 like


the
 the
 Economist
 or
 Time
 magazine
 cover


phenomenon
 where
 by
 the
 time
 the
 taco


thing
 came
 out,
 whether
 it
 was
 from
 us


or
 or
 from
 Armstrong,
 it
 was
 already


fading.
 It
 was
 already
 getting
 arguably


less
 true
 because
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


pattern
 of
 Trump's
 behavior
 on
 Jan
 20,


he
 had
 made
 a
 bunch
 of
 threats
 against


Mexico,
 Canada,
 China,
 etc.
 He


completely
 let
 them
 go,
 right?
 Nothing


happened.
 He
 didn't
 even
 mention
 them
 on


Jan
 20.
 Then
 he
 postponed
 them
 to


February
 1.
 He
 went
 one
 step
 further.
 He


actually
 signed
 the
 executive
 orders
 but


nothing
 happened.
 Then
 March
 1
 comes


around
 or
 March
 4
 rather
 and
 he
 actually


implements
 the
 tariffs
 but
 he
 walks
 them


back
 after
 a
 day.
 Then
 April
 2
 comes


around
 and
 he
 walks
 it
 back
 after
 a
 week


on
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 and
 a
 whole
 month


on
 China.
 So
 the
 point
 is
 there
 are


patterns
 but
 you've
 got
 to
 constantly
 be


reassessing
 them
 because
 the
 rule
 that


worked
 yesterday
 may
 no
 longer
 work
 to


today.
 Right?
 A
 second
 question
 is
 or


principle
 let's
 say
 is
 we've
 been
 very


we've
 tried
 to
 be
 very
 nimble
 and
 not


have
 a
 grand
 theory
 right
 so
 this
 gets
 a


little
 bit
 to
 the
 whole
 like
 Phil


Tedlock
 fox
 versus
 hedgehog
 like
 not
 be


too
 attached
 to
 grand
 ideas
 but
 look
 at


each
 prediction
 individually
 one
 of
 the


things
 that's
 really
 driven
 me
 crazy
 is


this
 narrative
 that
 Trump's
 trade


approach
 is
 all
 about
 China
 right
 that


is
 totally
 accurate
 over
 the
 course
 of


four
 years
 it
 is
 totally
 useless
 in
 the


short
 term
 because
 if
 I
 told
 you
 that


Trump's
 trade
 policy
 was
 going
 to
 be
 all


about
 China,
 which
 in
 hindsight
 is


correct,
 right?
 China's
 got
 a
 45%


tariff.
 Everyone
 else
 has
 a
 10%
 tariff.


But
 if
 I
 told
 you
 that
 on
 January
 19th


and
 you
 were,
 you
 know,
 running
 a
 hedge


fund,
 you
 would
 have
 been
 very,
 very


surprised
 that
 the
 first
 3
 months
 of
 the


Trump
 administration
 were
 all
 obsessed


with
 Mexico
 and
 Canada.
 Basically,
 this


whole
 China
 lens
 would
 have
 been
 useless


up
 until
 April.
 So
 that's
 a
 second
 thing


is
 trying
 not
 to
 take
 an
 overarching


view
 but
 look
 at
 it
 individually
 and
 try


to
 figure
 out
 what's
 he
 after
 in
 this


specific
 case.
 So
 you
 know
 the
 best


example
 is
 if
 you
 think
 he's
 after


tariff
 revenue
 then
 he's
 by
 definition


not
 going
 to
 back
 down.
 You
 can't
 get


revenue
 if
 you
 back
 down
 right
 and
 a


same
 country
 can
 be
 affected
 by


completely
 different
 motivations
 or
 or


you
 know
 confrontations.
 So
 Mexico
 in


the
 first
 3
 months
 was
 affected
 by


fentinel
 and
 immigration
 concerns
 which


were
 pretty
 clearly
 I
 mean
 it's
 always


easier
 to
 say
 in
 hindsight
 but
 pretty


clearly
 transactional
 like
 Trump
 just


wanted
 to
 be
 able
 to
 say
 that
 he
 had


done
 something
 about
 those
 issues.
 The


way
 that
 Trump
 is
 going
 to
 approach


Mexico
 in
 Q4
 this
 year
 to
 try
 to
 get


them
 to
 do
 USNCA
 revisions
 and
 open
 up


their
 energy
 market
 and
 change
 their


rules
 of
 origin
 on
 auto
 sector
 issues.


That's
 going
 to
 be
 much
 much
 tougher.


Right?
 So,
 same
 country,
 totally


different
 approach.
 Another
 is
 there's


this
 big
 like
 talking
 point,
 you
 know,


don't
 take
 Trump
 literally,
 but
 take
 him


seriously.


We
 hate
 that
 one
 around
 here.


Okay.
 So,
 yeah.
 So,
 so
 first
 of
 all,
 we


know
 not
 to
 take
 him
 seriously
 because


of
 taco
 or
 or
 you
 know,
 signum
 pre-


taco.
 But
 I
 actually
 think
 taking
 him


literally
 has
 been
 reasonably
 helpful


him
 and
 some
 of
 his
 advisers,
 those
 who


repeat
 his
 views.
 So,
 people
 like
 Bess


and
 Lutnik,
 they
 actually
 don't
 repeat


his
 views.
 They
 kind
 of
 freelance.
 But


if
 you
 take
 Carolyn
 Levit,
 one
 thing


that
 really
 sort
 of
 struck
 us
 was
 I


think
 it
 was
 on
 before
 the
 February
 1


deadline
 rather
 than
 the
 March
 one,
 but


I
 could
 be
 confusing
 them.
 She
 said


there
 in
 that
 press
 conference
 the
 day


before
 on
 the
 Friday,
 she
 said
 there
 is


absolutely
 nothing
 that
 Canada
 and


Mexico
 can
 do
 to
 prevent
 the
 president


from
 signing
 the
 executive
 order


tomorrow.
 Signing
 the
 executive
 order.


They
 never
 said
 they
 were
 going
 to


actually
 implement
 the
 terrorist,
 right?


And
 I
 know
 that
 sounds
 like
 a
 little


cute
 or
 Yeah.
 But
 there
 there
 is


something
 to
 that
 effect.
 And
 and
 if
 you


listen
 to
 Trump,
 I
 think
 it's
 quite


interesting.
 If
 you
 also
 look
 at
 how
 his


advisers,
 how
 he
 lets
 them
 talk,
 like


speak,
 you
 know,
 what
 kind
 of
 leash


they're
 on,
 they
 are
 allowed
 to
 say


anything,
 including
 the
 craziest
 stuff,


as
 long
 as
 they
 don't
 reduce
 his


optionality,
 right?


So,
 he
 benefits
 from
 them
 going
 nuts
 as


long
 as
 he
 doesn't
 get
 cornered
 by
 their


comments.


[Music]


Let's
 go
 back
 to
 uh
 the
 recent
 war
 and


something
 I'm
 interested.
 So
 looking
 at


the
 cumulative
 odds,
 you
 20%
 preemptive


Iranian
 capitulation,
 45%
 Israeli


mission
 accomplished.
 when
 you're
 coming


up
 with
 those
 odds,
 like
 how
 much
 do
 you


really
 have
 to
 know
 about
 the
 size
 and


scale
 and
 quality
 of
 the
 respective


weapon
 systems
 of
 Israel
 and
 Iran?


Because
 ultimately
 to
 some
 degree
 prior


to
 the
 US
 intervention,
 the
 question
 was


the
 degree
 to
 which
 one
 side's
 missiles


or
 their
 missile
 defense
 was
 stronger


than
 the
 others.
 So,
 how
 do
 you
 learn


about
 that
 and
 how
 important
 is
 it
 to


actually
 have
 really
 high
 quality


information
 about
 each
 side's
 arsenals?


So,
 that
 actually
 gets
 a
 little
 bit
 back


to
 what
 is
 Signum
 and
 who
 who
 we
 are


because
 I'd
 say
 there
 are
 different


types
 of
 shops
 in
 in
 our
 industry,


right?
 There
 are
 shops
 that
 are
 based
 on


Intel,
 right?
 So,
 it's
 like
 what
 we're


hearing
 in
 Congress
 or
 I
 play
 golf
 with,


you
 know,
 Scott
 Besson
 or
 whatever.


That's
 not
 us.
 We
 do
 access
 events
 and
 a


bunch
 of,
 you
 know,
 really
 cool
 stuff.


We
 took
 clients
 to
 Ukraine
 to
 meet
 with


the
 Ukrainian
 government
 and
 get
 a
 sense


of
 what
 post-war
 reconstruction
 type


policy
 might
 be.
 We
 do
 that
 stuff,
 but


it's
 not
 part
 of
 our
 research,
 right?


And
 that's
 because
 intel,
 in
 addition


to,
 you
 know,
 potentially
 if
 you've
 got


MNPI,
 etc.,
 that
 that
 gets
 legally


dubious.
 In
 addition
 to
 that
 problem,
 it


doesn't
 make
 for
 good
 predictions,


right?
 Because
 Scott
 Besson
 himself


didn't
 know
 on
 April
 8
 whether
 Trump
 was


going
 to
 back
 down
 the
 next
 day.
 He
 knew


he
 was
 working
 on
 him,
 but
 he
 didn't


know.
 Assad
 was
 not
 sure
 whether
 he
 was


going
 to
 be
 toppled
 or
 not.
 Right.
 So,


there's
 that.
 And
 then
 there
 are
 shops


that
 are
 very
 focused
 on
 country


expertise.
 So,
 it's
 like,
 you
 know,
 I


lived
 in
 Venezuela
 for
 15
 years,
 so


here's
 my
 take
 on
 whether
 Huaido's
 coup


is
 going
 to
 succeed
 or
 not.
 And
 don't


get
 me
 wrong,
 like,
 we've
 got
 regional


experts.
 We
 have a
 Mexico
 office
 with
 a


Mexican
 guy
 leading
 it,
 years
 and
 years


of
 experience
 in
 LAM,
 etc.
 So,
 it's
 not


that
 we
 don't
 do
 that,
 but
 the
 point
 is


where
 we
 think
 our
 value
 ad
 is
 is
 on
 the


process.
 And
 we've
 basically
 adopted


like
 a
 few
 principles.
 One
 is
 the
 Phil


Tetlock
 principle
 that
 I
 I
 mentioned


earlier
 which
 is
 it's
 not
 really
 about


who
 you
 are
 it's
 how
 you
 proceed
 right


so
 it's
 precisely
 what
 is
 your
 model


like
 what
 is
 your
 process
 and
 that's


where
 another
 guy
 comes
 into
 focus
 which


is
 Brisbeno
 de
 Mskita
 that
 a
 lot
 of


people
 will
 know
 about
 political


scientists
 very
 focused
 on
 essentially


the
 logic
 of
 political
 survival
 right


like
 leaders
 will
 always
 put
 their
 own


advantage
 ahead
 of
 anything
 and
 that's


why
 you
 know
 you've
 got
 situations
 where


like
 Netanyahu
 is
 never
 going
 to
 agree


to
 a
 hostage
 deal
 because
 it
 would
 risk


his
 coalition.
 And
 why
 would
 he
 risk
 his


coalition
 or,
 you
 know,
 why
 would
 he


risk
 losing
 power
 just
 to
 satisfy
 Trump?


That's
 where
 it
 gets
 interesting
 though,


is
 none
 of
 these
 rules
 is
 failroof,


right?
 Because
 using
 that
 logic,
 one
 of


the
 push
 backs
 I
 got
 on
 on
 our
 ceasefire


calls
 in
 the
 past
 was
 why
 would
 Hamas


ever
 give
 up
 the
 leverage
 of
 hostages,


right?
 And
 that
 sounds
 like
 a


conversation
 and
 the
 truth
 is
 they've


given
 up
 hostages
 twice
 now,
 right?


You've
 got
 to
 stay
 like
 pretty
 nimble


and
 humble.
 there
 there
 is
 no
 like


perfect
 answer
 but
 that
 sort
 of
 process


approach
 can
 can
 be
 helpful.
 Now
 to
 get


back
 to
 your
 initial
 question
 about
 like


how
 much
 knowledge
 you
 need.
 You
 do
 need


technical
 knowledge
 but
 you
 don't
 need


to
 have
 it
 inhouse.
 So
 we
 don't
 ever


outsource
 any
 of
 our
 analysis
 like
 no


one
 external
 has
 ever
 come
 up
 with
 a


prediction
 for
 us
 or
 written
 any
 of
 our


notes.


But
 what
 we
 do
 is
 we
 break
 down
 a
 big


issue
 into
 sub
 questions
 and
 then
 we
 go


out
 and
 try
 to
 find
 the
 answer.
 And
 some


of
 that
 will
 be
 in
 open
 source.
 Some
 of


that
 will
 be
 trying
 to
 speak
 with
 an


expert
 on
 XYZ
 missile
 range.
 So
 yeah,


the
 answer
 is
 you
 do
 need
 it,
 but
 you


can
 break
 it
 down
 and
 not
 make
 it
 part


of
 your
 core
 business
 model
 and
 instead


just
 sort
 of
 have
 it
 as
 a
 research


process.


You
 mentioned
 being
 humble
 just
 then.


And
 I'm
 wondering,
 so
 you
 know,
 in
 the


Iran
 situation,
 you
 published


probabilities
 and
 your
 base
 case
 and
 all


of
 that.
 and
 I
 think
 events
 didn't
 pan


out
 quite
 the
 way
 you
 expected.
 What


happens
 when
 you're
 just
 wrong
 about
 a


particular
 prediction?
 So,
 you
 know,


you've
 laid
 out
 your
 analysis,
 maybe
 you


had
 a
 really
 great
 way
 of
 reasoning


around
 scenarios
 and
 things
 like
 that,


but
 nevertheless,
 something
 happened


that
 you
 did
 not
 expect.
 What
 do
 you
 do?


So,
 there's
 a
 couple
 answers
 to
 that.


Well,
 there's
 several.
 The
 the
 first


couple
 are
 deflection.
 The
 third
 is
 the


real
 answer.
 Um,
 so
 one
 is
 in
 any
 of


these
 situations,
 you've
 got
 lots
 of


different
 predictions,
 right?
 So,
 for


example,
 we
 didn't
 expect
 that
 Trump


would
 actually
 go
 in
 and
 bomb
 Ford
 out


because
 we
 expected
 the
 Israelis
 to
 do


it
 on
 their
 own.
 But
 we
 were
 on
 the


right
 side
 of
 the
 regime
 change
 call.
 We


were
 on
 the
 right
 side
 of
 the
 Hormuz


call.
 We
 were
 on
 the
 right
 side
 of


Israel
 staying
 away
 from
 trying
 to
 knock


out
 Iranian
 oil
 production,
 which
 looked


hairy
 during
 that
 first
 weekend,
 and
 so


on
 and
 so
 forth.
 So,
 that
 that's
 one.


The
 second
 is
 you
 basically
 have
 to
 try


to
 figure
 out
 why
 you
 got
 it
 wrong,


right?
 And
 from
 there
 you
 can
 typically


learn
 something
 for
 the
 next
 time.
 So
 in


this
 instance,
 for
 example,
 I
 was
 far


too
 focused
 on
 the
 Israelis
 capabilities


and
 whether
 or
 not
 the
 Israelis
 were


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 this
 on
 their
 own


and
 not
 focused
 enough
 on
 Trump's


appetite
 to
 get
 involved
 for
 political


reasons.
 Right.
 Where
 it
 gets
 really


ironic
 is
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 I
 was
 of


the
 view
 that
 the
 Israelis
 would
 be
 able


to
 go
 out
 and
 knock
 out
 Florida
 on
 their


own
 is
 because
 for
 the
 previous
 12


months
 I've
 been
 telling
 clients
 the


Israelis
 have
 the
 capability
 to
 strike


Iran
 on
 their
 own
 and
 they
 are
 going
 to


do
 it
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 bolt
 from


the
 blue.
 I
 didn't
 expect
 it
 to
 be


exactly
 when
 they
 did
 it
 because
 the


nuclear
 talks
 were
 still
 ongoing.
 But


the
 point
 is
 back
 then
 the
 big
 push
 back


I
 would
 get
 constantly
 was
 the
 Israelis


don't
 have
 the
 planes
 to
 reach
 Iran.


they
 don't
 have
 the
 refueling


capability,
 you
 know,
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so


forth.
 And
 so
 that
 gets
 back
 to
 this


thing
 that
 there
 is
 no
 like
 one
 rule


that
 you
 can
 like,
 you
 know,
 to
 to
 sort


of
 one
 rule
 to
 rule
 them
 all,
 right?


There
 is
 no
 such
 thing.
 You've
 got
 to


constantly
 be
 reassessing.
 You
 know,


when
 we
 talk
 to
 economists
 and
 market


practitioners,
 you
 know,
 one
 of
 the


terms
 that
 comes
 up
 a
 lot
 is
 regime


change.
 And
 I
 obvious
 in
 this
 case
 I
 got


to
 be
 careful.
 I
 don't
 mean
 literally


like
 the
 question
 of
 whether
 the
 Iranian


regime
 changes
 but
 this
 idea
 of
 like


regime
 change
 in
 markets
 like
 oh
 does


the
 relationship
 between
 bonds
 and


stocks
 change
 over
 time
 or
 is
 the
 Fed
 in


inflation
 fighting
 mode
 or
 deflation


fighting
 mode
 whatever
 like
 these
 are


certain
 relationships
 relationships


change
 and
 I'm
 curious
 like
 there
 are


many
 people
 who
 perceive
 in
 perhaps
 the


medium-term
 future
 that
 maybe
 the


USIsrael
 relationship
 is
 going
 to
 change


that
 maybe
 there
 are
 parts
 of
 growing


louder
 contingents
 within
 the
 Republican


party
 and
 both
 parties
 really,
 but


within
 the
 Republican
 party
 that
 do
 not


want
 to
 deploy
 US
 military
 assets
 or


resources
 in
 the
 same
 way,
 the
 same


level
 of
 support
 to
 Israel
 in
 the
 past.


And
 who
 knows
 how
 that
 is
 going
 to


transpire,
 but
 I'm
 curious
 like
 how
 you


think
 like,
 okay,
 there's
 some


relationship
 the
 two
 countries
 might


have,
 but
 all
 relationships
 could


change.
 And
 if
 that
 relationship
 does


change,
 then
 it
 changes
 the
 short-term


expectation
 on
 any
 given
 war.
 And
 so
 I'm


curious
 in
 your
 process
 or
 internally


you
 think
 about
 this
 idea
 of


relationship
 regime
 change
 and
 could
 at


some
 point
 down
 the
 future
 and
 we
 don't


know
 when
 could
 some
 of
 these
 alliances


or
 partnerships
 or
 you
 know
 friend


relationships
 change
 and
 then
 that
 force


a
 calculation
 change
 when
 an
 acute
 event


happens?


It's
 a
 great
 question
 but
 I
 would
 say


that
 there
 is
 a
 pretty
 big
 difference.
 I


I
 think
 I
 mean
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 in
 the


markets
 but
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 a
 big


difference
 with
 financial
 markets
 which


is
 the
 regime
 changes
 happen
 but
 they


happen
 much
 more
 slowly


and
 so
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 more
 time
 to
 bake


them
 in
 right
 so
 you
 know
 you
 started


the
 podcast
 by
 sort
 of
 talking
 about
 how


there
 are
 these
 like
 talking
 points
 that


come
 up
 over
 and
 over
 right
 the
 the


world
 like
 geopolitical
 risk
 is
 going to


be
 big
 in
 2025
 right


a
 big
 one
 of
 those
 is
 multipolar
 world


right
 or
 zero
 world
 like
 this
 idea
 that


it's
 like
 the
 breakdown
 of
 global
 order


and
 so
 on
 and
 so
 forth
 So
 those
 only


happen
 every
 20
 or
 30
 years


or
 that
 the
 US
 may
 not
 want
 to
 be
 the


hedgeimon
 at
 some
 point
 that
 it
 may
 not


have
 the
 same
 appetite
 to
 be
 a
 global


police.
 And
 so
 for
 example,
 you
 know,


the
 Tucker
 Carlson
 wing
 of
 the


Republican
 party
 very
 loud
 against
 this


idea
 like
 why
 should
 the
 US
 have
 such
 a


global
 military
 footprint?
 Things
 like


that.
 At
 some
 point
 that
 could
 be
 a


dominant
 strain
 of
 thought
 and
 we
 if
 it


becomes
 one,
 we
 might
 not
 necessarily


know
 when
 the
 flipping
 point
 is.


Totally
 agreed.
 But
 going
 back
 to
 how


it's
 a
 slow
 process,


I
 think
 Trump
 was
 a
 really
 and
 like


literally
 what
 happened
 over
 the
 past


month
 was
 a
 very
 very
 good
 test
 case
 for


that,
 right?
 And
 the
 fact
 that
 Trump


himself
 who
 is
 known
 to
 be
 not
 just


isolationist
 but
 also
 pacifist,
 you


know,
 one
 can
 chuckle,
 but
 like
 he
 does


have
 a
 pacifist
 instinct,
 I
 think,
 and


pretty
 stingy
 in
 terms
 of
 use
 of


American
 power
 and
 use
 of
 American
 money


and
 resources,
 etc.
 The
 fact
 that
 even


he
 intervened
 I
 think
 tells
 us
 something


about
 how
 slow
 that
 process
 is
 going
 to


be.


Sure.


Okay.
 We
 mentioned
 cliches
 a
 couple


times
 and
 I
 think
 this
 is
 probably
 a


cliche
 too,
 but
 you
 know
 cliches
 can
 be


true.
 Maybe
 that's
 why
 they
 become


cliches.
 But
 when
 it
 comes
 to


geopolitical
 risk
 analysis,
 do
 things


feel
 more
 difficult
 to
 you
 nowadays


versus
 when
 you
 perhaps
 started
 in
 the


industry?
 Does
 the
 world
 seem
 more


complex?
 And
 I
 guess
 given
 the
 Trump


administration
 and
 some
 of
 the


unpredictability
 that
 we
 discussed


earlier,
 do
 things
 seem
 more
 volatile,


more
 uncertain,
 and
 just
 harder
 to
 sort


of
 get
 a
 handle
 on?


Yes,
 I
 think
 that
 is
 absolutely
 fair.


And
 it
 really
 does
 sort
 of
 echo
 back
 to


to
 Joe's
 question
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 you


take
 something
 like
 the
 the
 relationship


between
 Russia
 and
 China
 pre
 Ukraine
 war


or
 pre2022
 version
 of
 the
 Ukraine
 war.


For
 15
 years
 before
 that,
 there
 had
 been


an
 established
 talking
 point
 amongst


pretty
 much
 all
 political
 analysts,


which
 was
 it's
 an
 alliance.
 It's
 an
 axis


of
 convenience,
 right?
 They
 get
 along,


they
 work
 together,
 but
 they
 don't


really
 trust
 each
 other.
 They
 don't


really
 love
 each
 other.
 And
 so
 you
 you


knew
 that
 when
 push
 comes
 to
 shove,
 when


they
 had
 to
 like
 put
 their
 interest


above
 the
 other,
 etc.
 You
 knew
 which
 way


it
 was
 going
 to
 go.
 That
 was
 very


unclear
 for
 the
 first
 like
 year.
 And
 and


frankly,
 some
 could
 argue
 it's
 still


unclear
 post
 Russia
 invasion,
 right?
 or


Ukraine
 invasion.
 Are
 they
 now
 in
 it


forever
 and
 sort
 of
 Russia
 basically


China
 is
 grooming
 Russia
 to
 help
 it
 when


it
 goes
 after
 Taiwan
 or
 is
 it
 still
 very


much
 an
 access
 of
 convenience
 where
 the


Chinese
 might
 cut
 off
 you
 know
 drone


inputs
 to
 the
 Russians
 for
 the
 right


price
 if
 there's
 American
 export
 control


lifting
 or
 something
 like
 that
 right
 and


to
 your
 question
 Tracy
 the
 fact
 that
 so


much
 stuff
 is
 changing
 so
 fast
 means


that
 you
 have
 even
 less
 historical


background
 or
 historical
 data
 which
 as


we
 said
 earlier
 you're
 already
 starting


with
 very
 very
 small
 data
 sets,
 right?


And
 so
 the
 temptation
 there
 is
 to
 kind


of
 just
 make
 it
 up
 as
 you
 go
 and
 that's


where
 things
 get
 dicey.


Do
 you
 think
 that's
 possible
 like
 that


China
 has
 a
 price
 for
 which
 it
 would


hold
 back
 on
 Russian
 access
 to
 drone


materials
 and
 such?


So
 my
 answer
 to
 that
 would
 be
 in
 a
 way


that
 one
 is
 actually
 not
 that
 hard


because
 even
 if
 there
 were
 a
 price,
 we


are
 so
 far
 from
 being
 willing
 to
 pay


that
 price
 that
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 it's


never
 going
 to
 see
 the
 light
 of
 day.


What's
 a
 surprise
 thing
 that
 you
 think


is
 not
 on
 anyone's
 radar
 right
 now


geopolitically
 that
 you
 think
 we
 should


be
 focusing
 more
 on?
 This
 is
 my
 way
 of


soliciting
 ideas
 for
 future
 episodes,
 by


the
 way.


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 No,
 I
 so
 I
 actually
 I
 love


that
 question
 because
 but
 I
 I
 hope
 this


is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 disappointing,
 but


I
 it
 is.


I
 always
 say
 like
 the
 whole
 black
 swan


thing
 is
 irrelevant.
 Like
 black
 swans


almost
 never
 happen.
 The
 stuff
 that


blows
 up
 in
 our
 face
 is
 stuff
 that
 is


visible
 pretty
 far
 ahead
 like
 not


necessarily
 far
 ahead
 of
 time
 but
 that


is
 pretty
 obvious
 and
 the
 difficulty
 is


for
 the
 analyst
 predicting
 the
 details


right
 like
 in
 what
 month
 is
 Putin
 going


to
 invade
 or
 whatever
 or
 what
 part
 of


Ukraine
 is
 he
 going
 to
 invade


and
 the
 other
 difficulty
 for
 for
 clients


of
 course
 is
 how
 to
 trade
 that
 right


given
 that
 you
 can
 get
 radically


different
 outcomes
 but
 the
 events


themselves
 I
 mean
 there
 were
 four
 or


five
 months
 of
 Russian
 buildup
 in
 in


front
 of
 Ukraine
 And
 in
 you
 know


December
 January
 people
 were
 still


debating
 whether
 it's
 going
 to
 happen
 or


not.
 And
 another
 example
 is
 CO.
 People


talked
 about
 CO
 as
 a
 black
 swan.
 I
 mean


if
 you
 read
 any
 of
 those
 you
 know
 world


economic
 reform
 global
 risk
 reports
 for


the
 past
 like
 15
 years
 pandemics
 were


always
 top
 10
 like
 or
 even
 top
 five.


People
 knew
 that
 pandemics
 were
 a
 major


potential
 business
 risk.
 So
 again
 it's


it's
 more
 like
 the
 the
 details
 rather


than
 something's
 going
 to
 just
 pop
 up
 in


our
 face.


In
 the
 next
 I
 don't
 know
 5
 years.
 Do
 you


expect
 China
 to
 invade
 Taiwan?


Yes.
 Uh
 if
 if
 I
 mean
 the
 word
 invade
 is


the
 one
 that
 bugs
 me,
 okay,
 which
 is
 not


not
 going
 to
 surprise
 you
 because
 I


think
 that
 it's
 more
 likely
 to
 be
 a


blockade
 for example
 than
 an
 actual


amphibious
 invasion.
 So
 So
 that
 view
 for


example
 is
 pretty
 I
 think
 banel,
 right?


The
 problem
 is
 again
 from
 the
 perception


of
 how
 do
 you
 manage
 it?
 One
 of
 the


things
 that
 I
 think
 is
 totally


underappreciated
 is
 everyone
 knows
 that


a
 blockade
 is
 a
 risk,
 right?
 But
 the


part
 that's
 totally
 underappreciated
 is


that
 the
 Chinese
 could
 roll
 it
 out


literally
 overnight.
 So
 I
 think
 what
 is


underappreciated
 is
 we're
 not
 going to


get
 any
 buildup.
 We're
 going
 to
 wake
 up


one
 morning
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 done.


So
 that's
 one
 problem.
 A
 second
 problem


is
 a
 bloodless
 blockade
 that
 lasts,
 you


know,
 3
 months
 or
 6
 months
 that
 is


essentially
 a
 continuous
 anaconda


squeeze
 on
 Taiwan
 and
 the
 Taiwanese


economy
 could
 actually
 be
 far
 worse
 from


a
 purely
 market
 perspective.
 Forget


about,
 you
 know,
 normative
 aspects.
 far


worse
 than
 a
 one-month
 war
 regardless
 of


the
 outcome,
 right?
 Because
 it's
 the


length
 of
 the
 disruption
 for
 business


operations
 that
 that
 could
 be
 most


problematic.
 So
 again,
 it's
 it's
 how
 you


look
 at
 it,
 I
 think,
 that
 that
 can
 make


a
 difference.


Back
 in
 college,
 I
 wrote
 an


essay/dissertation


on
 the
 chances
 of
 China,
 you
 know,


invading
 Taiwan
 or
 going
 after
 Taiwan.


And
 I
 think
 I
 had
 my
 base
 case
 was
 they


were
 going
 to
 do
 something
 before
 the


2008
 Olympics.
 So,
 uh,
 yeah,
 I
 I


you
 empathize
 with
 the
 difficulty
 of


timing.


I
 totally
 do,
 Andrew.
 That
 was


fantastic.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 coming


on
 Off
 Lots.


Thanks,
 Andrew.
 That
 was
 great.


Thank
 you,


[Music]


Joe.
 There
 was
 a
 lot
 to
 pick
 out
 of
 that


conversation.
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 struck
 me,
 okay,
 first
 of
 all,
 you


know,
 he
 was
 talking
 about
 black
 swans,


and
 this
 is
 something
 that
 Taleb
 himself


pointed
 out
 at
 our
 recent
 live
 event,


which
 is
 we
 shouldn't
 really
 be
 worried


about
 black
 swans
 because
 they
 are
 by


their
 very
 nature
 unknowable.
 We
 should


be
 worried
 about
 the
 gray
 swans
 like
 a


pandemic.
 I
 think
 that
 makes
 a
 lot
 of


sense.
 Secondly,
 the
 emphasis
 on


motivation


was
 really
 interesting
 to
 me
 because


this
 is
 something
 that
 I
 have
 wondered


about
 the
 tariffs.
 If
 Trump
 needs
 to


have
 a
 bunch
 of
 tariff
 deals
 to
 have
 his


trade
 war
 seem
 to
 be
 a
 success,
 then


what
 does
 that
 mean
 on
 the
 revenue
 side?


Because
 he
 has
 also
 talked
 about
 how


tariff
 revenue
 is
 going
 to
 offset
 a


bunch
 of
 tax
 cuts
 and
 things
 like
 that.


So,
 I
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 important
 and
 I


still
 haven't
 figured
 out
 that
 one


particularly.
 And
 then
 the
 other
 thing


is
 he
 was
 talking
 about
 Trump's
 advisors


and
 this
 is
 something
 I
 hadn't
 realized,


but
 he's
 right.
 The
 one
 thing
 they
 can't


do
 is
 limit
 the
 president's
 optionality.


Yeah.


It
 seems
 like
 they
 can
 throw
 out
 pretty


much
 any
 scenario,
 any
 response,
 any


possibility
 that
 they
 want,
 but
 they


can't
 do
 anything
 that
 would
 box
 him
 or


pigeon
 hole
 into
 one
 position.
 That
 was


interesting.
 Yeah,
 you
 know,
 by
 the
 way,


just
 going
 back
 to
 Andrew's
 note
 that
 we


kept
 referencing
 on
 uh
 June
 16th,
 he
 had


underestimated
 the
 odds
 that
 the
 US


would
 intervene
 as
 he
 did.
 However,
 I
 to


his
 credit,
 here
 were
 his
 final


takeaways.


US
 intervention
 is
 certainly
 possible,


but
 still
 not
 base
 case.
 Okay,
 it
 did


happen.
 However,
 he
 says
 likewise,


regime
 change
 is
 plausible,
 but
 still


unlikely.
 So,
 he
 was
 right
 on
 that.
 And


then
 he
 said,
 "The
 overwhelming
 majority


of
 scenarios
 end
 in
 a
 negotiated
 Iran


capitulation
 with
 no
 meaningful
 damage


done
 to
 global
 oil
 supply
 or
 Gulf


assets."
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 pretty
 good


conclusion
 that
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


cuz
 if
 you
 figure
 people
 care
 about
 the


markets
 and
 oil
 supply,
 more
 or
 less
 a


useful
 conclusion
 to
 have
 been
 able
 to


make
 on
 June
 16th.
 I
 have
 to
 say
 the


speed
 with
 which
 Andrew
 answered,
 "Yes,


there
 is
 going
 to
 be
 something
 in


Taiwan."
 It's
 boring,
 isn't
 it?
 freaked


that
 I
 was
 like
 I
 was
 hoping
 that
 he


would
 hum
 and
 haw
 a
 little
 bit
 about


that
 and
 then
 this
 idea
 that
 it's
 just


going
 to
 happen
 so
 quickly
 it'll
 be


overnight.
 There's
 we're
 not
 going
 to


get
 any
 signs
 of
 it
 and
 then
 the
 world


is
 going
 to
 change
 dramatically
 the
 next


morning
 in
 ways
 that
 we
 don't
 really


know.


Well,
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 there
 are


people
 like
 me
 who
 have
 been
 saying
 with


great
 confidence
 that
 this
 is
 going
 to


happen
 for
 a
 while
 and
 it
 doesn't.
 So


maybe
 that's
 that's
 some
 hope
 for
 you,


Joe.
 I
 mean
 for
 me
 I
 mean
 for
 lots
 of


people
 certainly
 hope
 there
 is
 not


anyway


um
 the
 other
 thing
 I
 was


I
 just
 didn't
 like
 how
 how
 comfortably


he
 was
 asked
 because
 I
 in
 five
 years
 yes


he
 didn't
 have
 seem
 to
 have
 any
 doubt


the
 other
 thing
 I
 was
 thinking
 we


probably
 should
 have
 asked
 this
 but
 the


time
 frames
 for
 things
 cuz
 you
 mentioned


regime
 change
 in
 Iran
 like
 okay
 well
 it


hasn't
 happened
 but
 it's
 also
 been
 2


weeks
 since
 we
 had
 this
 big
 big
 event


that
 happened
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


necessarily
 off
 the
 table
 so
 I'd
 be


curious
 curious
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 he


thinks
 about
 like
 the
 time
 frame
 of


possibilities
 as
 well.
 But
 oh
 well,
 we


already
 spoke
 for
 about
 45
 minutes,
 so


we
 should
 probably
 leave
 it
 there.
