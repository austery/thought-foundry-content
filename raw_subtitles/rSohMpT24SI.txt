Let
 me
 just
 start
 with
 what
 I
 think
 the


big
 takeaways
 are
 from
 this
 piece


because
 this
 is
 the
 first
 time
 we've


ever
 done
 this
 style
 piece.
 We
 produce


so
 much
 work
 and
 so
 much
 analysis.
 It's


like
 exhaust
 uh
 in,
 you
 know,
 inside
 of


our
 team
 and
 we
 thought,
 you
 know,
 we


have
 so
 many
 different
 thoughts
 and
 and


points
 of
 view.
 Why
 don't
 we
 put
 them
 on


paper
 and
 share
 them
 out
 with
 the
 world?


So
 that
 was
 the
 genesis
 of
 this.
 My
 big


takeaways
 from
 doing
 this
 one,
 you
 know,


AI
 demand
 side
 is
 crazy.
 The
 actual


uptake
 growth
 quality
 of
 companies
 in
 AI


is
 extremely
 encouraging
 from
 our


standpoint.
 Companies
 are
 starting
 to


run
 themselves
 better.
 I'm
 going
 to
 show


you
 some
 stats
 on
 that
 that,
 you
 know,


there's
 been
 some
 sort
 of
 X
 buzz
 uh


including
 this
 morning.
 You
 know,
 kind


of
 debating
 what's
 going
 on
 there.
 But


this
 crop
 of
 companies
 I
 would
 say
 is


more
 impressive
 uh
 than
 than
 prior
 crops


of
 companies
 partially
 because
 the


demand
 for
 their
 products
 is
 so
 high.
 Um


that's
 demand
 side.
 Supply
 side
 is


healthy
 right
 now.
 Uh
 but
 we
 are


starting
 to
 see
 some
 signs
 of
 things,


you
 know,
 that
 are
 stretched
 a
 little


bit.
 I'll
 I'll
 talk
 about
 what
 we
 see


and
 what
 we're
 looking
 out
 for.
 We've


been
 fortunate
 to
 be
 a
 part
 of
 a
 lot
 of


these
 great
 companies.
 Um,
 and
 the
 most


exciting
 action
 that
 is
 happening
 in
 the


private
 markets,
 it's
 it's
 it's
 it's
 AI


and
 it's
 happening
 in
 the
 private


markets.
 Um,
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 show


some
 slides
 about
 that.
 And
 then
 lastly,


my
 big
 conclusion,
 what
 has
 me
 so


excited
 about
 where
 we
 are
 now
 is
 just


how
 early
 we
 are
 in
 this
 product
 cycle.


Um,
 you
 know,
 product
 cycles
 drive
 our


business.
 And,
 you
 know,
 these
 are
 10,


15
 year
 cycles
 and
 we're
 just
 at
 the


very
 beginning
 of
 it
 right
 now.
 So,


let's
 dive
 in.
 We
 invest
 across
 all


private
 stages.
 This
 is
 a
 chart
 that


just
 shows
 our
 activity.
 We're
 very


busy.
 It's
 across
 all
 verticals.
 We
 on


the
 growth
 side
 have
 been
 most
 active
 in


AI
 and
 infer
 apps
 uh
 and
 then
 in
 in
 AD,


but
 also
 very
 active
 in
 our
 other


verticals
 um
 as
 well.


And
 I'm
 going
 to
 zoom
 through
 some
 of


these.
 I
 hate
 to
 do
 the
 A16Z
 commercial,


but
 I
 really
 like
 this
 slide.
 You
 know,


I
 think
 we
 have
 the
 chance
 to
 work
 with


some
 of
 the
 best
 models
 and
 apps
 and


infra
 companies.
 Uh
 obviously,


>> I'm
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 that
 on
 that
 side.


Gong
 it.


>> I
 do
 like
 that
 slide
 a
 lot.


>> Soundboard
 effect
 here.
 I'm
 happy.


>> We
 debated.
 Yeah,
 we
 debated
 how
 early


to
 put
 that
 slide
 on
 the
 deck
 and
 and
 uh


I
 said
 put
 it
 further
 back
 and
 I
 was


overruled.
 So
 thankfully
 um
 anyway,


here's
 some
 data.
 So
 we
 collect
 tons
 and


tons
 of
 data
 as
 a
 growth
 team
 because


we're
 basically
 seeing
 every
 growth


stage
 company
 in
 the
 market
 uh
 as
 a


either
 portfolio
 company
 or
 as
 a


prospect.
 And
 so
 we
 have
 a
 great
 data


analysis
 team.
 We
 did
 some
 data


analysis.
 I
 think
 this
 stuff
 is
 just


super
 interesting.
 We
 geek
 out
 on
 it.
 To


me,
 the
 big
 conclusion
 from
 this
 is
 2025


was
 a
 year
 for
 accelerated
 revenue


growth.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 revenue
 obviously


slowed,
 you
 know,
 in
 2022,
 23,
 24


following
 the
 rate
 hikes
 and
 and
 the


pullback
 in
 some
 of
 the
 tech
 stuff.
 But


2025
 reversed
 that
 trend.
 Um
 and
 you


know
 it
 accelerated
 across
 uh
 different


you
 know
 types
 of
 companies
 as
 we
 rank


them
 by
 decile
 and
 cortile.
 Um
 but


especially
 among
 you
 know
 the
 outlier


companies
 you
 know
 it
 really
 accelerated


and
 you've
 probably
 seen
 us
 put
 this


slide
 on
 a
 page
 before
 but
 the
 fastest


growing
 AI
 companies
 are
 reaching
 100


million
 bucks
 of
 revenue
 significantly


faster
 than
 the
 fastest
 growing
 SAS


companies
 in
 their
 era.
 And
 there's
 a


really
 important
 thing
 I
 want
 to
 call


out
 about
 why
 that
 is
 the
 case
 and
 that


is
 because
 end
 customer
 demand
 is
 so


strong
 and
 the
 products
 are
 so


compelling.
 It's
 not
 because
 they
 spend


more
 money
 on
 sales
 and
 marketing.
 It's


actually
 the
 opposite.
 The
 the
 best
 AI


companies
 that
 are
 growing
 the
 fastest


are
 not
 the
 ones
 spending
 the
 most


amount
 of
 money
 on
 sales
 and
 marketing


and
 they're
 spending
 less
 money
 on
 sales


and
 marketing
 than
 their
 SAS


counterparts.
 And
 yet
 they're
 growing


much
 much
 faster.
 So
 this
 was
 a
 slide


showing
 just
 the
 growth
 of
 the
 AI


companies
 versus
 the
 nonAI
 companies.


Roughly
 speaking,
 the
 AI
 companies
 are


growing
 two
 and
 a
 half
 times
 plus
 faster


than
 the
 non-AI
 companies.
 And
 that


shouldn't
 be
 a
 huge
 surprise.
 The
 best


of
 the
 AI
 companies
 are
 growing
 very


very
 fast.
 We
 had
 to
 triple
 check
 this


data
 when
 we
 saw
 the,
 you
 know,
 the
 the


AI
 top,
 you
 know,
 top
 performers
 growing


693%
 year-over-year.
 um
 but
 it
 matches


up
 our
 experience
 you
 know
 and
 and


anecdotes
 that
 we
 see
 from
 the
 portfolio


companies.
 So
 that's
 growth.
 This
 is
 the


margin
 profile
 uh
 that
 we're
 seeing
 in


the
 data
 set
 and
 again
 these
 are


internal
 data
 sets
 that
 we
 have
 of


portfolio
 companies
 and
 companies
 that


we
 look
 at
 uh
 as
 potential
 investments.


Gross
 margins
 are
 a
 little
 bit
 worse
 for


AI
 companies.
 Um,
 you've
 probably
 heard


us
 talk
 about
 this
 before,
 but
 in
 a
 way


we
 feel
 like
 low
 gross
 margins
 for
 AI


companies
 are
 sort
 of
 a
 badge
 of
 honor


in
 the
 sense
 that
 we
 want
 to
 see
 if
 if


if
 if
 low
 gross
 margins
 are
 a
 result
 of


high
 inference
 costs,
 one
 that
 means


people
 are
 using
 AI
 features
 and
 two,
 we


have
 a
 belief
 that
 those
 inference
 costs


over
 time
 are
 going
 to
 come
 down.
 Uh
 so


in
 an
 odd
 way,
 if
 we
 see
 an
 AI
 pitch
 and


the
 gross
 margins
 are
 super
 high,
 we're


a
 little
 bit
 skeptical
 because
 that
 may


mean
 that
 the
 AI
 features
 are
 not


actually
 what
 is
 being
 bought
 uh
 or
 used


by
 the
 customers.
 We're
 going
 to
 talk


about
 AR
 per
 FTE,
 but
 this
 is
 a
 new


thing
 that
 we've
 started
 focusing
 on
 and


this
 is
 one
 of the
 things
 that
 got
 a
 lot


of
 pickup
 and
 discussion
 uh
 on
 X
 in
 the


last
 few
 days.
 ARR
 per
 FTE
 is
 sort
 of
 a


measure
 of
 the
 efficiency
 of
 how
 you
 run


your
 company
 in
 general.
 So
 it


encapsulates
 all
 of
 your
 costs.
 Uh
 it


encapsulates,
 you
 know,
 not
 just
 your


sales
 and
 marketing,
 which
 is
 an


efficiency
 measure
 that
 we've
 always


kind
 of
 looked
 at
 when
 we
 do
 analysis
 in


the
 past,
 but
 it
 also
 captures
 your


overhead.
 It
 captures
 your
 R&D.
 Uh
 and


so
 for
 the
 best
 AI
 companies,
 they're


running
 at
 like
 500,000
 to
 a
 million


dollars
 uh
 per
 per
 FTE.
 And
 the
 rule
 of


thumb
 for
 previous
 software
 businesses


in
 the
 SAS
 era
 was
 like
 $400,000
 in
 the


last
 generation.
 Again,
 I'm
 going
 to


talk
 about
 this
 a
 little
 bit
 more,
 but


the
 reason
 why
 this
 is
 the
 case
 is


mostly
 because
 demand
 is
 very
 very


strong
 for
 their
 products.
 Um,
 you
 know,


and
 so
 they
 need
 a
 less
 resource
 to
 go


take
 it
 to
 market.


>> David,
 maybe
 a
 quick
 clarifying
 just


before
 we
 we
 um
 go
 to
 this
 slide
 here.


So,
 how
 do
 we
 how
 do
 you
 define
 AI


companies?
 Is
 that
 defined
 as
 postjack


GBT
 versus
 historical
 AI
 ML
 companies


founded
 by
 a
 certain
 time
 period?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 it's
 sort
 of
 post
 postg


and
 and
 some
 of
 them
 have
 were
 founded


like
 right
 around
 that
 time.
 We'd
 give
 a


little
 bit
 of
 grace
 but
 but
 if
 they're


their
 first
 product
 in
 market
 was
 an
 AI


you
 know
 native
 product
 then
 that's
 how


we
 define
 it.


>> Got
 it.
 And
 then
 um
 maybe
 this
 is
 a
 good


point
 but
 where
 you
 can
 punt
 till
 later


but
 like
 one
 of
 the
 questions
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 folks
 uh
 are
 trying
 to
 understand


is
 the
 magnitude
 of
 change
 and
 expected


revenue
 and
 growth
 from
 companies
 from


the
 SAS
 era
 to
 AI
 era
 companies
 and


you've
 talked
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the


magnitude
 of
 revenue
 etc
 but
 what


happens
 to
 those
 that
 are
 not
 AI
 native


will
 they
 have
 a
 hard
 time
 competing


against
 AI
 native
 companies
 are
 they
 all


shifting
 uh
 will
 we
 see
 more
 fallout
 how


should
 people
 be
 thinking
 about
 their


historical
 portfolio.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 the
 way
 that
 we're
 approaching


this
 with
 our
 portfolio
 is,
 you
 know,


you
 you
 need
 to
 adapt
 to
 the
 AI
 era
 or


die.
 Um,
 and
 so
 that's
 both
 on
 the
 front


end
 and
 the
 back
 end.
 So
 on
 the
 front


end,
 you
 need
 to
 think
 about
 how
 you
 can


incorporate
 AI
 into
 your
 product


natively
 and
 not
 just,
 you
 know,
 attach


a
 chatbot
 app
 into
 your
 existing


workflow,
 but
 reimagine
 what
 it
 can
 mean


with
 AI
 and
 be
 aggressive
 about


disrupting
 yourself
 and
 changing.
 Um,


and
 then
 on
 the
 back
 end,
 you
 know,
 I
 I


I
 shared
 some
 of
 the
 stats
 around
 the


efficiency
 that
 the
 companies
 are


running
 at.
 This
 is
 going
 to
 change
 too.


And
 so
 you
 need
 to
 be
 fully
 rolled
 out


with
 the
 latest
 coding
 models
 for
 all
 of


your
 developers
 um
 and
 all
 of
 the
 latest


tools
 across
 every
 different
 function


inside
 your
 organization.
 Um
 the
 the


biggest
 uptake
 has
 been
 in
 coding
 so
 far


and
 that's
 where
 we've
 seen
 the
 biggest


leaps.
 There
 have
 been
 major
 major


changes
 like
 in
 the
 last
 two
 months
 on


this
 like
 month
 and
 a
 half
 in
 this.
 Um


you
 know
 Andre
 Carpathy
 has
 written


about
 this.
 I
 was
 on
 a
 catchup
 with
 one


of
 our,
 you
 know,
 sort
 of
 pre-AII


companies.
 Uh,
 and
 this
 is
 a
 this
 is
 a


founder
 who's
 very
 AI,
 like
 he's
 very
 AI


deep
 and
 so
 he's
 adapting
 his
 company.


We
 were
 talking
 this
 week
 and
 he
 told
 me


that
 he
 was
 frustrated
 with
 one
 of
 their


products
 and
 so
 he
 just
 took
 two


engineers
 that
 are
 very
 deep
 in
 AI
 and


assigned
 them
 to
 build
 it
 from
 scratch


with
 cloud
 code
 and
 codeex
 and
 cursor


and
 just
 they
 had
 unlimited
 budget
 on


coding
 tools.
 Uh
 and
 he
 said
 he
 thinks


it's
 going
 somewhere
 between
 10
 and
 20x


faster
 than
 progress
 that
 they
 had


before.
 And
 the
 bills
 that
 they
 have


associated
 with
 that
 is
 actually
 they're


high
 enough
 that
 it
 will
 cause
 him
 to


rethink
 what
 his
 entire
 organization


will
 look
 like.
 The
 conclusion
 was


basically
 I
 need
 my
 entire
 product
 and


engineering
 organization
 working
 this


way
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 going to
 happen


within
 the
 next
 12
 months.
 But
 what
 does


that
 mean
 for
 what
 the
 team
 design


actually
 is
 and
 and
 where
 does
 product


start
 and
 where
 does
 start
 you
 know
 and


even
 where
 does
 design
 start
 in
 that


process.
 So
 it
 feels
 like
 December
 was


sort
 of
 a
 turning
 point
 on
 code
 um
 and


you
 know
 the
 next
 12
 months
 it's
 going


to
 kind
 of
 hit
 it's
 it's
 either
 going
 to


hit
 and
 take
 hold
 in
 companies
 or
 those


companies
 I
 think
 are
 going to
 be
 moving


much
 slower
 than
 their
 peers.
 Um,
 so
 you


know,
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 the
 preAI


companies,
 you
 know,
 adapt,
 we
 have
 we


have
 another
 example
 of
 a
 company
 that


is
 a
 pre-ai
 software
 company
 and
 the
 CEO


has
 gotten
 totally
 AI
 pill
 and
 he's


like,
 we're
 going
 to
 become
 an
 AI


product.
 Like,
 we're
 going
 to
 ship,
 you


know,
 your
 employees
 are
 now
 your
 AI


agents.
 How
 many
 agents
 do
 you
 have?


Like
 those
 are
 the
 things
 that
 he's


talking
 about.
 Um
 you
 know
 we
 have


another
 one
 that
 was
 very
 extreme
 about


it
 and
 he
 said
 I
 now
 ask
 the
 question
 um


for
 for
 every
 task
 that
 we
 now
 need
 to


complete
 uh
 can
 I
 do
 it
 with
 electricity


or
 do
 I
 need
 to
 do
 it
 with
 blood
 like


this
 is
 like
 the
 extreme
 mindset
 shift


that's
 happening
 you
 know
 with
 uh
 with


our
 companies
 and
 and
 so
 I
 I'm
 I'm
 happy


to
 see
 that
 our
 PAI
 companies
 are
 moving


very
 fast
 and
 trying
 to
 adapt
 uh
 but


they
 very
 much
 need
 to
 adapt
 to
 this
 new


era
 both
 front
 end
 product
 wise
 and
 back


end
 how
 they
 run
 their
 companies.


>> Totally.
 Yeah.
 Maybe
 tactically
 almost


every
 portfolio
 you
 have
 to
 go
 line
 by


line
 on
 the
 company
 to
 understand
 where


the
 founder
 is
 on
 that
 journey
 and
 how


much
 they
 are
 implementing
 from
 the


ground
 up
 and
 and
 you
 know
 what
 you
 said


in
 terms
 of
 blowing
 up
 existing


operations.
 That's
 also
 happening
 in


post
 AI
 companies
 too
 and
 and


increasingly
 people
 are
 just
 looking


every
 six
 months.
 It's
 like
 the
 things


we
 built
 six
 months
 ago
 could
 be
 vastly


improved
 by
 based
 on
 what
 is
 available


today.
 So
 that
 if
 that
 rate
 is


continually
 happening,
 the
 preAI


companies
 are
 needing
 to
 to
 increasingly


10x
 catch
 up
 to
 that
 point.


>> Yeah.
 The
 good
 news
 for
 the
 prei


companies
 is
 the
 business
 model


evolution
 is
 still
 early
 days.
 So
 the


most
 disruptive
 thing
 that
 can
 happen
 to


you
 is
 a
 technology
 and
 product
 shift


and
 also
 a
 business
 model
 shift
 at
 the


same
 time.
 There's
 really
 one
 I
 I
 think


of
 the
 business
 models
 as
 like
 a


spectrum
 and
 you
 know
 and
 I'm
 talking


about
 like
 enterprise
 like
 B2B
 just
 to


keep
 it
 simple
 but
 the
 spectrum
 is


basically
 licenses
 and
 this
 was
 like
 the


pre-SAS
 you
 know
 license
 and
 maintenance


business
 models
 then
 you
 had
 SAS
 and


subscription
 and
 that
 was
 typically


seatbased
 and
 that
 was
 a
 big
 innovation


and
 it
 was
 very
 disruptive
 like
 the


architecture
 and
 cloud
 delivery
 was


disruptive
 but
 the
 business
 model
 change


was
 very
 disruptive
 like
 just
 go
 look
 at


what
 happened
 to
 Adobe
 as
 they
 went


through
 that
 transition.
 Then
 you
 have


this
 transition
 to
 consumption
 based
 so


usage
 based
 and
 this
 is
 how
 the
 clouds


charge
 and
 so
 many
 of
 the
 sort
 of
 volume


based
 like
 taskbased
 type
 businesses


have
 already
 adapted
 that
 and
 shifted
 to


that
 from
 you
 know
 seat
 based
 to


consumption.
 Um
 and
 then
 the
 next


iteration
 will
 be
 outcome
 based.
 So,
 you


know,
 when
 you
 when
 you
 do
 a
 task,
 um,


you
 know,
 and
 ideally
 when
 you


successfully
 complete
 a
 task,
 you
 get


paid
 based
 on
 the
 successful
 completion


of
 that
 task.
 The
 only
 area
 where
 that's


really
 possible
 today
 to
 pull
 off
 is
 is


probably
 customer
 support,
 customer


success,
 because
 you
 can
 kind
 of


objectively
 measure
 the
 resolution
 of
 of


something.
 Um
 but
 we'll
 see
 what
 happens


with
 the
 capabilities
 of
 the
 models
 to


the
 extent
 that
 other
 functions
 besides


customer
 support
 can
 measure
 those
 kinds


of
 outcomes
 that
 would
 be
 a
 huge


disruptive
 force
 uh
 for
 incumbents
 and


and
 honestly
 seats
 to
 consumption
 might


be
 a
 big
 disruption
 if
 the
 composition


of
 companies
 changes
 as
 well.
 Uh
 but


that
 next
 one
 is
 the
 is
 the
 really
 big


one


>> for
 sure.
 Um
 speaking
 of
 blood
 versus


electricity
 we
 should
 go
 to
 AR
 over
 FTE.


Uh
 this
 next
 slide
 here.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So
 the
 big
 the
 big


debate
 that
 was
 going
 on
 on
 this
 one
 uh


on
 the
 next
 slide
 was
 um
 like
 oh
 my
 gosh


look
 at
 the
 AI
 efficiency
 gains
 that
 are


happening
 in
 the
 market.
 Now
 there's
 a


little
 bit
 of
 that
 in
 this
 like


companies
 running
 themselves
 a
 little


bit
 differently
 and
 you
 know
 you
 take


the
 example
 that
 I
 gave
 about
 you
 know


the
 two
 engineers
 who
 are
 rebuilding
 the


product
 like
 sure
 I
 would
 say
 my


observation
 from
 our
 companies
 even
 the


AI
 native
 ones
 is
 they
 run
 leaner


partially
 because
 they've
 just
 grown
 so


quickly
 and
 the
 demand
 is
 so
 strong.
 I
 I


wouldn't
 say
 yet
 we're
 at
 the
 point


where
 companies
 have
 fully
 reimagined


the
 way
 they
 run
 themselves.
 I
 think


this
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 the
 result
 of
 our


data
 set
 being
 the
 best
 of
 the
 best


companies
 and
 demand
 signals
 for
 those


being
 extremely
 high.
 Uh
 so
 they
 you


know
 they
 have
 less
 resources
 to
 serve


that
 demand
 and
 frankly
 you
 know


efficient
 general
 efficiency
 gains
 that


have
 happened
 in
 the
 technology
 market


you
 know
 out
 of
 the
 kind
 of
 2021
 most


you
 know
 most
 bloated
 era.
 Um,
 so
 we're


starting
 to
 see
 some
 early
 signs
 of
 that


efficiency,
 but
 the
 wholesale
 run
 your


company
 totally
 differently.
 I
 think,


you
 know,
 we're
 we're
 kind
 of
 early
 in


that
 in
 that
 journey.
 I'd
 say
 the


coolest
 one
 that
 I've
 seen
 is
 um
 in
 the


in
 the
 public
 markets
 that
 anyone
 can
 go


read
 about
 is
 probably
 Shopify
 where


they,
 you
 know,
 Toby's
 awesome.
 Like


he's
 a
 CEO
 that's
 that's
 close.
 He's
 in


a
 bunch
 of
 our
 groups
 and
 stuff.
 Um,
 and


he
 does
 a
 great
 job
 and
 he,
 you
 know,
 he


fully
 embraced
 this
 a
 couple
 years
 ago.


And
 then
 um
 there
 one
 of
 our
 staff


writers
 uh
 actually
 wrote
 this
 whole
 big


deep
 dive
 on
 how
 Shopify
 AI
 itself
 you


know
 in
 terms
 of
 you
 know
 employee


direction
 process
 etc.
 Um
 and
 that's


just
 probably
 scratching
 the
 surface
 of


what's
 going
 to
 happen
 over
 the
 next
 5


years.


A
 good
 seg
 to
 the
 next
 section
 on
 what


are
 these
 companies
 actually
 doing
 in


our
 favorite
 topic
 which
 is
 lawyers
 have


only
 increased
 in
 this
 new
 world
 of
 uh


AI's
 meeting
 lawyers
 um
 not
 the
 opposite


uh
 I
 I
 love
 the
 tweet
 I
 don't
 know if


you
 saw
 it
 earlier
 this
 week
 that
 uh
 a


corporate
 lawyer
 was
 quoted
 saying
 LLM


have
 actually
 increased
 my
 workload


because
 every
 client
 thinks
 they're
 a


lawyer
 now
 it's
 a
 good
 seg
 to
 Harvey


which
 is
 the
 next
 slide


>> that's
 that's
 very
 good
 that's
 very
 good


Harvey's
 so
 great
 I
 so
 okay
 this
 is
 a


real
 test
 for
 me
 because
 you
 know
 I
 love


talking
 about
 our
 portfolio
 companies


and
 I'm
 supposed
 to
 go
 through
 this


section
 quickly
 because
 uh
 you
 know
 I


think
 people
 people
 know
 these
 companies


uh
 hopefully
 um
 the
 takeaway
 on
 this
 one


you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 big
 things
 that
 we


look
 for
 and
 um
 one
 of
 the
 questions
 I


think
 that
 came
 in
 was
 how
 do
 you
 know


that
 revenue
 is
 going
 to
 be
 sustainable


like
 these
 companies
 they
 all
 grew


really
 really
 fast
 but
 is
 it
 fleeting


and
 the
 big
 thing
 that
 we
 push
 ourselves


to
 do
 is
 make
 sure
 we
 go
 super
 super


deep
 on
 revenue
 venue
 retention,


renewals,
 uh,
 and
 product
 engagement,


actually
 time
 spent,
 how
 often
 are


people
 logging
 into
 the
 platform,
 when


they're
 in
 the
 platform,
 what
 does
 their


activity
 look
 like?
 And
 what
 you
 see
 on


this
 page
 is
 with
 the
 onset
 of
 much


better
 product
 that
 they've
 built
 over


the
 last
 couple
 of
 years,
 plus
 the


improvement
 of
 reasoning
 models,
 it


turns
 out
 lawyering
 and
 reasoning
 uh
 go


go
 hand
 in
 hand.
 um
 users
 are
 spending


about
 double
 the
 amount
 uh
 in
 the


product
 as
 they
 had
 before.
 So
 it
 turns


out
 that
 AI
 is
 is
 really
 good
 at


lawyering.
 Um
 again
 there's
 not
 fewer


lawyers.
 Uh
 but
 I
 think
 you
 know
 AI
 is


very
 very
 good
 at
 this
 and
 I
 think


lawyers
 are
 getting
 a
 lot
 more


efficient.
 The
 most
 important
 thing
 as


it
 relates
 to
 Harvey
 is
 they're
 just


spending
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 in
 the
 product


and
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 value
 out
 of
 it


which
 is
 great.


>> Let's
 go
 to
 uh
 a
 bridge.
 Oh
 unless
 you


want
 to
 keep
 talking
 about
 lawyer.
 Oh,
 I


was
 just
 going
 to
 make
 a
 comment.
 In
 all


the
 seven
 years
 that
 I've
 known
 you,
 I


wouldn't
 have
 ever
 uh
 discerned
 that


you're
 from
 Kentucky
 other
 than
 this


moment
 now.
 By
 the
 way,
 you
 say
 lawyer.


>> That
 was
 a
 tell.


>> My
 uh
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 couple
 of


those
 words
 in
 my
 vocabulary.
 I
 can't
 I


that
 I
 I
 don't
 you
 know,
 my
 my
 wife


always
 jokes.
 She's
 like,
 you
 know,
 you


go
 home,
 you
 have
 like
 one
 bourbon,
 and


then
 you
 you
 talk
 like
 you
 probably
 did


when
 you
 were
 18.
 the
 Kentucky
 came
 out


when
 it
 came
 to
 lawyers.


>> It's
 it's
 it's
 10:25
 a.m.
 I
 have
 not
 had


any
 bourbons
 today.
 So,
 um


>> important
 distinction.


>> It's
 important
 distinctions.
 Yes,


exactly.
 So,
 uh
 a
 bridge
 a
 bridge
 is


another
 one
 that's
 super
 super
 exciting.


I
 mean,
 this
 is
 like
 the
 doctors
 rave


about
 um
 getting
 to
 to
 have
 access
 to
 a


bridge
 and
 how
 much
 time
 it
 saves
 them


uh
 and
 how
 much,
 you
 know,
 better
 it


makes
 their
 lives.
 Um,
 so
 you
 know,
 one


of
 the
 customers
 that
 we
 talked
 to


described
 it
 like
 a
 trusted
 deputy.
 The


chart
 on
 the
 right
 shows
 something
 we


look
 for,
 which
 is
 the
 blue
 line
 shows


the
 growth
 in
 users
 and
 the
 green
 line


shows
 the
 engagement
 of
 those
 users.
 And


so
 as
 they
 have
 massively
 grown
 the


number
 of
 users,
 you'd
 be
 a
 little


worried
 if
 engagement
 of
 those


incremental
 users
 that
 they
 were
 adding


was
 going
 down.
 but
 instead
 they
 have


extremely
 high
 usage
 among
 the
 people


who
 use
 the
 product
 and
 that
 has


actually
 held
 steady
 and
 grown
 a
 little


bit
 even
 as
 they've
 added
 tons
 and
 tons


of
 more
 users.
 So
 the
 these
 are
 just


examples
 of
 the
 kind
 of
 data
 that
 we


look
 for
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 feel


confident
 that
 the
 revenue
 these


companies
 are
 generating
 is
 sustainable


and
 again
 these
 companies
 are
 growing


faster
 than
 you
 know
 any
 of
 the


predecessor
 companies
 but
 but
 it's
 very


sustainable.
 It's,
 you
 know,
 it's
 high


engagement,
 it's
 high
 retention.
 Uh,
 and


that's
 critically
 important
 for
 us.
 Same


thing
 with
 11
 Labs.
 Voice
 is
 the


centerpiece
 of
 so
 many
 of
 the
 new
 AI


tools.
 You
 know,
 I
 talked
 about
 customer


support
 on
 the
 B2B
 side.
 Um,
 but,
 you


know,
 so
 much
 um,
 you
 know,
 other


personal
 tools,
 business
 tools,
 you


know,
 start
 start
 with
 voice.
 Um,
 the


usage
 growth
 is
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 love
 to


look
 at
 on
 this
 chart.
 It's
 just


staggering.
 Uh
 and
 this
 company
 is


growing
 very
 fast
 and
 is
 a
 great
 example


of
 one
 of
 these
 companies
 that
 runs


extremely
 efficiently.
 Um
 so
 11
 Labs
 is


is
 really
 is
 really
 a
 great
 one.
 Non
 is


the
 next
 one.
 So
 this
 is
 another
 this
 is


a
 different
 example.
 So
 this
 is
 actually


a
 good
 example
 of
 what
 I
 was
 describing


earlier.
 So
 they
 were
 early
 to
 this,
 you


know,
 AI
 shift
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 they
 spent


a
 lot
 of
 effort
 making
 sure
 that
 they


could
 take
 the
 most
 of
 the
 AI


capabilities
 and
 make
 their
 business


better.
 And
 so
 the
 biggest
 way
 you
 can


see
 it
 in
 their
 business
 today
 is
 in
 uh


the
 handling
 of
 resolutions.
 So
 part


part
 of
 what
 they
 have
 is,
 you
 know,


agents
 that
 have
 to
 handle
 travel


bookings
 or
 travel
 changes.
 AI
 is
 now


handling
 50%
 of
 those
 user
 interactions.


And
 this
 is
 hard
 stuff
 like
 this
 is


travel
 bookings.
 This
 is
 changes
 to


travel.
 Uh
 so
 this
 is
 not
 you
 know


complex
 like
 tell
 me
 the
 balance
 of
 my


bank.
 Uh
 you
 know
 this
 is
 like
 complex


workflow
 that
 that
 AI
 is
 now
 able
 to


handle.
 The
 way
 you
 see
 that
 in
 the


business
 is
 a
 20
 percentage
 point


expansion
 of
 gross
 margins
 over
 the
 last


3
 years.
 And
 that's
 just
 exceptional


impact.
 And
 so
 you
 know
 you
 need
 to


adapt
 or
 die.
 Well
 their
 competitors
 are


not
 adapting.
 They're
 very
 old
 school


and
 while
 you
 know
 they've
 been
 sitting


still
 and
 and
 doing
 things
 the
 old
 way,


Non
 now
 has
 20
 percentage
 point
 higher


gross
 margins
 than
 those
 incumbents.
 And


then
 you
 know
 Flock


Flock
 is
 doing
 absolutely
 incredible


work.
 I've
 talked
 about
 them
 so
 much.


It's
 it's
 the
 most
 compelling
 customer


value
 proposition
 that
 we
 see
 in
 our


portfolio
 because
 what
 their
 ROI
 is
 is


solving
 crime.
 Um
 the
 10%
 stat
 we've


covered
 before.
 Each
 year
 Flock
 is


solving
 700,000
 crimes.
 Um
 the
 the
 the


data
 point
 on
 the
 right
 also
 is
 a
 data


point
 that
 just
 shows
 per
 officer
 that


where
 there's
 flock
 they're
 clearing


almost
 10%
 um
 you
 know
 more
 crimes.
 So


huge
 impact
 on
 the
 community.
 Obviously


they
 have
 a
 great
 you
 know
 they
 have
 a


great
 business
 and
 financial
 model
 that


goes
 along
 with
 it.
 But
 the
 but
 the


impact
 uh
 on
 their
 product
 or
 from
 their


product
 is
 is
 exceptional.


>> Okay.


>> Uh
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 don't
 know if
 you
 see


the
 chat
 lighting
 up
 of
 people
 saying


that
 they're
 three
 bourbons
 deep.
 Uh


>> oh,
 I
 didn't
 see
 it.


>> For
 what
 it's
 worth,
 uh
 there
 is
 one


question
 about
 um
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about


the
 the
 benchmark?
 Like
 if
 you
 were
 to


think
 about
 traditional
 industries
 like


finance
 for
 example
 and
 using
 JP
 Morgan


as
 a
 benchmark,
 what
 would
 you
 calibrate


the
 Fortune
 500
 in
 terms
 of
 AI
 adoption?


And
 then
 maybe
 I'll
 overlay
 that
 that


question
 that
 that
 Xavier
 mentioned
 as


well
 with
 you
 know
 there
 was
 that
 study


about
 enterprise
 adoption
 from
 MIT
 at


the
 early
 outset
 of
 last
 year
 and
 they


were
 measuring
 all
 sorts
 of
 wonky


things.
 Uh
 maybe
 say
 a
 little
 bit
 more


about
 how
 and
 what
 you're
 hearing
 from


Fortune
 500
 CEOs.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 what
 we're
 hearing
 from
 Fortune


500
 CEOs
 I
 would
 say
 is
 and
 maybe
 this


is
 the
 key
 sort
 of
 link
 between
 those


two
 points.
 What
 we're
 hearing
 from


Fortune
 500
 CEOs
 is
 we
 have
 to
 adapt.


We're
 dying
 to
 understand
 what
 AI
 tools


we
 need.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 we're
 ready
 to


change.
 We,
 you
 know,
 our
 businesses
 are


going
 to
 fully
 roll
 things
 out
 and,
 you


know,
 we're
 we're
 ready.
 We're
 going
 to


become
 AI
 companies.


That's
 quite
 different
 than
 what
 is


actually
 happening.
 And
 I
 think
 the


biggest
 disconnect
 of
 sort
 of,
 you
 know,


that
 mindset
 compared
 to
 actual
 change


in
 the
 businesses
 is
 just
 change


management
 is
 hard.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 it's


it's
 hard
 enough
 to
 get
 people
 to
 just


use
 an
 AI
 assistant
 to
 help
 them
 do


their
 jobs
 better.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 coding


is
 probably
 the
 easiest
 one
 to
 get


people's
 minds
 wrapped
 around.
 Customer


support.
 It's
 such
 a
 better,
 faster,


cheaper,
 obvious
 thing.
 But
 in
 terms
 of


actually,
 you
 know,
 general
 management


of
 businesses,
 changing
 business


processes,
 change
 management,
 it's


extremely
 hard
 to
 do.
 And
 so
 I'm
 not


surprised
 that
 there
 are
 anecdotes
 out


there
 that
 suggest,
 oh,
 you
 know,
 things


are
 moving
 slower
 than
 expected,
 but
 for


the
 best
 companies
 that
 are
 fully


embracing
 it
 and
 actually
 know
 what
 to


do,
 it
 has
 tremendous
 business
 impact


already.
 Uh
 so
 you
 know
 I
 think
 there's


going
 to
 be
 a
 sort
 of
 reckoning
 over
 the


next
 five
 years
 of
 who
 can
 actually


embrace
 change
 push
 through
 change


management
 you
 know
 adopt
 all
 the
 best


products
 um
 and
 those
 that
 don't
 and
 I


think
 there'll
 be
 major
 differences
 in


productivity
 you
 know
 we
 have
 some


charts
 later
 in
 the
 slides
 you
 know


which
 I
 can
 talk
 to
 but
 you
 know
 the


expectations
 around
 productivity


enhancements
 and
 you
 know
 and
 growth
 and


all
 that
 stuff
 um
 you
 know
 the


expectations
 are
 high
 and
 I
 think
 a


bunch
 of
 companies
 will
 achieve
 those


and
 the
 ones
 that
 don't
 are
 going
 to
 be


at
 a
 huge
 disadvantage.
 Chime
 said
 they


reduced
 their
 support
 costs
 by
 60%.
 Um,


Rocket
 Mortgage
 said
 that
 they
 saved
 1.1


million
 hours
 in
 underwriting,
 up
 6x


year-over-year,
 and
 that
 was
 40
 million


bucks
 of
 run
 rate
 annual
 savings.
 So,


you
 we're
 seeing
 pockets
 of
 it
 in
 nonAI


businesses
 and
 I
 think
 this
 is
 going
 to


be
 a
 really
 interesting
 year
 to
 watch


over
 the
 next
 12
 months.
 I
 think
 you're


going
 to
 see
 a
 ton
 more
 anecdotes,
 but


there
 will
 be
 companies
 that
 can
 figure


it
 out
 and
 there
 are
 going
 to
 be


companies
 that
 don't.


>> Totally.
 And
 also,
 they've
 a
 lot
 of


these
 corporations
 have
 had
 to
 orient


their
 business
 to
 be
 ready
 for
 AI
 as


well.
 Like
 there's
 one
 version
 of
 just


like
 using
 a
 chatbot,
 right?
 And
 how


much
 productivity
 gained
 that
 actually


gets
 you?
 Probably
 not
 a
 lot,
 right?
 But


if
 you
 have
 to
 actually
 completely
 upend


your
 systems
 information
 and
 backend
 to


be
 ready
 for
 AI,
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 is


probably
 latent
 and
 and
 being
 built
 up


now
 into
 actually
 seeing
 the
 outcomes


associated
 with
 it.


>> AI
 winners
 are
 driving
 the
 public


markets.
 They
 account
 for
 almost
 80%
 of


the
 S&P
 500's
 return.
 So
 this
 is
 sort
 of


the
 major
 thing
 driving
 the
 economy
 and


the
 stock
 market.
 Public
 markets
 are


doing
 very
 well.
 Um
 but
 the
 fundamentals


are
 sound.
 So
 the
 prices
 are
 going
 up
 or


you
 know
 there's
 some
 blips
 like
 the


last
 couple
 of
 days
 but
 they're


generally
 doing
 well.
 Um
 but
 the


fundamentals
 are
 very
 sound.
 Um
 and
 I


would
 say
 the
 evidence
 of
 froth
 is


minimal.
 So
 recent
 performance
 is
 driven


by
 EPS
 growth.
 Um
 multiples
 have


contracted
 slightly
 maybe
 more
 than


slightly
 uh
 if
 you're
 a
 SAS
 company
 over


the
 last
 few
 days
 or
 a
 couple
 weeks.
 Um


but
 I
 would
 say
 the
 market
 is
 priced
 on


in
 general
 uh
 earnings
 earnings
 and


earnings
 growth.
 So
 the
 earnings


multiples
 are
 higher
 than
 average
 but


nowhere
 near
 the
 dot.
 And
 so
 you
 can


just
 look
 at
 the
 charts
 and
 see
 where
 we


are
 and
 you
 know
 that
 that
 gives
 me
 some


comfort.
 And
 again
 the
 earnings
 of
 the


companies
 that
 are
 the
 biggest
 drivers


of
 the
 market
 in
 general
 I
 feel
 like
 are


pretty
 sound.
 The
 companies
 are
 good.


So,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 health
 of
 these


companies,
 I
 would
 say,
 is
 pretty
 good


and
 and
 the
 valuations
 are
 higher
 than


average
 in
 the
 past,
 but
 they
 don't
 feel


super
 alarming.
 I
 often
 say
 the
 leading


tech
 companies
 that
 I
 was
 uh
 I
 was
 just


talking
 about
 are
 the
 best
 businesses
 in


the
 history
 of
 the
 world.
 Um,
 if
 you


just
 look
 over
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time,


they
 have
 shown
 margin
 improvement
 that


suggests
 that
 is
 probably
 true.
 And


that's,
 you
 know,
 that's
 on
 the
 left


side
 of
 the
 page.
 So,
 investors
 are


paying
 for
 profits,
 not
 lossmaking


growth.
 Um,
 and
 that's
 a
 big
 contrast


from
 2122
 era,
 sort
 of
 21
 era.
 Um,
 and


obviously
 a
 big
 contrast
 from
 a
 dot


adjusted
 for
 margins.
 Um,
 multiples
 are


are
 not
 that
 high.
 And
 so
 again,
 I
 like


summarize,
 you
 know,
 five
 slides
 worth


of
 materials.
 The
 market's
 higher
 than


it
 has
 been
 in
 the
 past,
 but
 I
 think,


you
 know,
 there's
 high
 expectations
 for


a
 reason.
 and
 and
 we're
 optimistic
 about


the
 impact
 of
 AI
 flowing
 through
 to


earnings,
 you
 know,
 overall
 in
 the


public
 markets
 in
 the
 coming
 years.
 Uh,


and
 maybe
 I'd
 focus
 your
 attention
 on


the
 right
 side,
 which
 is
 um,
 you
 know,


if
 you
 just
 took
 a
 fourbox
 of
 like
 low


growth,
 high
 growth,
 low
 margin,
 high


margin,
 and
 paired
 up
 those
 types
 of


companies.
 This
 is
 a
 chart
 that
 shows


how
 they
 trade.
 There's
 a
 premium
 for


the
 best
 companies.
 And
 what
 you
 see
 on


the
 the
 two
 columns
 on
 the
 right
 is
 high


growth,
 high
 margin
 companies
 and
 then


high
 growth
 and
 low
 margin
 companies.


Your
 bad
 box
 is
 obviously
 low
 growth,


low
 margin.
 And
 those
 companies


shouldn't
 be
 rewarded.
 They
 they
 they


should
 trade
 low.
 Uh
 and
 they
 do.
 But


the
 companies
 that
 are
 high
 growth
 and


high
 margin
 um
 and
 you
 know
 the
 high


growth
 and
 low
 margin,
 as
 long
 as
 they


have
 good
 unit
 economics
 and
 they're


scaling
 into
 their
 margins,
 they
 should


be
 rewarded.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 this
 is


good.
 Um,
 if
 you're
 not
 high
 growth,


even
 if
 you're
 high
 margin,
 it's
 tough


out
 there.
 And
 that's
 not
 surprising.


Again,
 I've
 talked
 about
 this
 in
 the


past
 in
 many
 different
 forms.
 But


ultimately,
 growth
 is
 the
 biggest
 thing


that
 drives
 returns
 over
 5
 to
 10
 years.


And
 so,
 it's
 nice
 for
 me
 to
 see
 high


growth
 is
 rewarded
 more
 than
 low
 growth.


U,
 but
 if
 you
 have
 high
 growth
 and
 high


margin,
 you're
 one
 of
 those
 great


businesses,
 it's
 being
 very
 rewarded.


This
 is
 just
 like
 we're
 going
 to
 talk


about
 supply
 side
 of
 the
 capex
 buildout.


So
 the
 buildout's
 massive,
 the
 size
 and


the
 concentration
 uh
 of
 the
 investment


is
 inherently
 risky
 just
 given
 how
 big


it
 is.
 Um
 while
 it
 has
 some
 bubbly


features,
 the
 underlying
 fundamentals
 I


would
 say
 bear
 little
 resemblance
 to


previous
 bubbles.
 Um
 the
 investment
 is


financed
 primarily
 by
 historically


profitable
 companies
 like
 very


profitable
 companies
 that
 I
 had
 talked


about.
 Um
 debt
 has
 started
 to
 enter
 the


picture.
 um
 cycle
 times
 have
 accelerated


which
 is
 good
 but
 you
 know
 model
 we're


closely
 monitoring
 the
 sort
 of
 cost
 of


training
 and
 the
 economics
 of
 that
 whole


equation
 right
 now
 it
 seems
 pretty
 good


the
 paybacks
 for
 the
 big
 model
 companies


that
 spend
 money
 on
 training
 models
 is


pretty
 good
 uh
 but
 we're
 monitoring
 that


closely
 most
 importantly
 we
 think
 that


AI
 is
 going
 to
 be
 you
 know
 the
 biggest


model
 buster
 that
 I've
 seen
 in
 my
 career


certainly
 um
 I've
 written
 about
 model


busters
 so
 I
 won't
 spend
 too
 much
 time


on
 them
 but
 they're
 companies
 that
 grow


faster
 and
 longer
 than
 anyone
 would
 have


would
 have
 modeled
 in
 any
 scenario.
 Like


iPhone
 is
 the
 classic
 case
 of
 this.
 You


know,
 if
 you
 if
 you
 take
 consensus


models
 uh
 from
 pre
 iPhone
 to
 5
 years


later,
 four
 years
 later,
 consensus


models
 were
 off
 for
 Apple's
 performance


by
 a
 factor
 of
 3x
 over
 four
 years.
 And


this
 is
 like
 the
 most
 covered
 company
 in


the
 world
 uh
 at
 the
 time.
 So,
 you
 know,


I
 think
 that
 the
 same
 thing
 is
 going
 to


happen
 in
 many
 pockets
 of
 AI
 where
 the


performance
 just
 massively
 uh
 exceeds,


you
 know,
 what
 any
 expectations
 in
 a


spreadsheet
 would
 would
 show
 you.
 So,


tech
 in
 general
 is
 itself
 a
 model


buster,
 but
 since
 2010,
 tech
 has


delivered
 high
 margin
 revenue
 at


unprecedented
 speed
 and
 scale.
 So
 it


often
 looks
 expensive
 early,
 but


repeatedly
 surprises
 to
 the
 upside,
 I


would
 say,
 um,
 and
 creates
 value,
 I


would
 say,
 far
 in
 excess
 of
 the
 capital


that's
 required,
 uh,
 to
 grow.
 And
 I
 I


have
 no
 reason
 to
 think
 it'll
 be


different,
 you
 know,
 this
 time
 around.


So
 relative
 to
 the
 dot,
 capex
 is


actually
 supported
 by
 cash
 flows,
 and


capex
 as
 a
 percentage
 of
 revenue
 is


considerably
 lower.
 So
 that's
 simple


headline.
 We
 can
 zoom
 to
 the
 next
 slide


but
 you
 know
 I
 feel
 much
 better
 about


this
 capex
 um
 you
 know
 dynamic
 than
 than


than
 do
 obviously
 hyperscalers
 are
 the


ones
 who
 are
 bearing
 the
 biggest
 brunt


of
 the
 capex
 and
 this
 is
 a
 very
 good


thing
 you
 know
 for
 our
 portfolio


companies
 this
 is
 great
 like
 I
 am
 all


for
 it
 get
 you
 know
 get
 as
 much
 capacity


in
 the
 ground
 get
 as
 much
 supply
 as
 you


as
 you
 possibly
 can
 on
 the
 ground
 for


training
 and
 inference
 this
 is
 a
 very


good
 thing
 and
 Again,
 the
 companies
 that


are
 bearing
 most
 of
 the
 brunt
 of
 this


are
 the
 best
 businesses
 of
 all
 time
 that


I
 had
 talked
 about
 before.
 So,
 one
 thing


that
 we're
 starting
 to
 monitor
 is
 the


introduction
 of
 debt
 into
 the
 equation.


So,
 you
 can't
 finance
 all
 of
 the


forecast
 capex
 that's
 to
 come
 with
 cash


flow,
 and
 we're
 starting
 to
 see
 some


debt.
 So,
 we're
 following
 this
 closely.


Um,
 we're
 generally
 not
 invested
 heavily


in
 companies
 with
 exposure
 to
 debt.
 Um,


do
 I
 feel
 comfortable
 with
 a
 bunch
 of


the
 companies
 on
 the
 page
 financing
 with


cash
 flow,
 continuing
 to
 produce
 cash


flow,
 and
 using
 debt
 even,
 you
 know,


Meta,
 Microsoft,
 AWS,
 Nvidia
 as


counterparties?
 Of
 course,
 I
 I
 feel


great
 about
 that.
 I
 mentioned
 the
 ones
 I


feel
 great
 about.
 I
 don't
 feel
 great


about
 all
 of
 them.
 So,
 not
 all


counterparties
 are
 the
 same.
 You
 know,


we're
 starting
 to
 see
 Private
 Credit
 get


a
 little
 bit
 more
 involved
 in
 the
 data


center
 buildout.
 And
 you
 know
 again
 the


company
 that's
 very
 well
 covered
 uh
 that


is
 kind
 of
 making
 a
 bet
 the
 company
 move


into
 becoming
 a
 cloud
 is
 is
 Oracle
 and


they've
 you
 know
 they've
 been
 profitable


forever
 and
 reducing
 their
 shares


forever.
 Um
 but
 the
 amount
 of
 capital


that
 they
 are
 committing
 um
 is
 very


large.
 It's
 a
 big
 bet.
 They're
 going
 to


go
 cash
 flow
 negative
 for
 many
 years
 to


come.
 Um,
 and
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 follow


some
 of
 the
 buzz
 around
 it,
 like
 the
 the


cost
 of
 their
 credit
 default
 swaps
 has


gone
 up
 um,
 you
 know,
 to
 like
 2%
 uh,


over
 the
 last
 three
 months.
 And
 so,


we're
 watching
 stuff
 like
 this.
 Again,


this
 is
 all
 generally
 good
 stuff
 uh,
 for


our
 portfolio
 companies,
 but
 we
 want
 to


make
 sure
 that
 the
 market
 overall
 is


healthy
 as
 well.
 So,
 this
 is
 just
 a


slide
 that
 shows
 the
 magnitude
 of
 the


pace
 of
 change
 of
 AI.
 So,
 comparing
 AI


buildout
 and
 AI
 revenue
 to
 what
 happened


with
 Azure.
 So
 the
 AI
 revenue
 is
 coming


along
 relative
 to
 the
 cloud.
 It
 took


Azure
 7
 years
 to
 reach
 one
 year
 of
 AI


revenue.
 Um
 so
 this
 this
 is
 just


Microsoft
 reporting
 data
 which
 I
 think


is
 a
 a
 cool
 way
 to
 to
 frame
 how
 quickly


this
 has
 happened.
 Um
 you
 know
 the


build's
 taken
 a
 very
 long
 time.
 Again


this
 this
 AI
 buildout
 is
 happening
 much


faster.
 Um
 but
 it
 took
 10
 years
 for


Azure
 revenue
 to
 surpass
 their
 capex.
 Um


and
 I
 think
 it's
 I
 think
 that
 sort
 of


ratio
 or
 equation
 is
 going
 to
 happen


much
 faster
 with
 AI.


We
 don't
 need
 to
 geek
 out
 too
 much
 on


depreciation,
 but
 this
 is
 one
 of the


topics
 that
 gets
 a
 lot
 of
 buzz
 in


finance
 circles,
 you
 know,
 just
 what
 are


your
 assumptions
 around
 depreciation
 of


chips
 in
 particular.
 Um,
 I
 would
 say
 the


pricing
 for
 older
 GPUs
 is
 very
 solid.


Um,
 early
 users
 stick
 with
 models
 a
 bit


longer,
 but
 later
 users
 quickly
 switch


to
 the
 new
 thing.
 So,
 that's
 the
 right


side.
 That's
 like
 kind
 of
 the
 model


side.
 On
 the
 chip
 side,
 um
 7
 to
 8y
 old


TPUs,
 Google
 actually
 disclosed
 this,
 7


to
 8y
 old
 TPUs
 actually
 have
 100%


utilization.
 Um
 and
 we
 very
 closely


monitor
 the
 price
 of
 chips
 in
 the


secondary
 market
 and
 the
 price
 to
 rent


A100s
 and
 H100s
 um
 has
 actually
 held
 up


very
 very
 well.
 So
 older
 generations
 of


chips
 are
 still
 still
 getting
 fully


utilized.
 So
 this
 is
 not
 something
 I


worry
 about
 uh
 yet
 but
 it
 gets
 a
 lot
 of


buzz
 and
 you
 know
 sort
 of
 alarmists
 uh


who
 like
 to
 to
 talk
 about
 risk
 in
 the


system.


All
 right
 some
 positive
 stuff.
 So
 uh
 the


the
 big
 thing
 that
 we
 talk
 about
 all
 the


time
 uh
 is
 is
 is
 this
 paradox
 right
 like


as
 tokens
 get
 cheaper
 consumption
 goes


up.
 All
 the
 hyperscalers
 report
 demand


is
 well
 in
 excess
 of
 supply.
 I
 believe


them
 when
 they
 say
 that.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 I


interviewed
 uh
 Gavin
 Baker,
 friend
 of


mine
 on
 our
 at
 our
 AI
 summit,
 and
 he
 was


comparing
 the
 buildout
 of
 uh
 the


internet
 and
 and
 laying
 all
 the
 fiber
 to


the
 buildout
 of
 data
 centers
 here.
 And,


you
 know,
 his
 his
 big
 line
 was
 there
 is,


you
 know,
 there
 is
 no
 dark
 GPU.
 There


are
 no
 dark
 GPUs.
 There
 was
 a
 dark


fiber.
 You
 had
 to
 lay
 fiber
 and
 then,


you
 know,
 it
 laid
 there
 dark
 and
 it


wasn't
 used.
 If
 you
 put
 a
 GPU
 in
 the


system
 in
 a
 data
 center,
 it
 gets
 fully


utilized
 immediately.
 And
 so
 that's
 a


very
 good
 sign,
 you
 know,
 in
 terms
 of,


you
 know,
 demand
 meeting
 supply
 uh


immediately.
 I
 mentioned
 this
 earlier,


earnest
 growth
 should
 come
 for
 these


companies
 like
 this
 is
 our
 expectation.


Um,
 and
 if
 it
 doesn't,
 then
 they
 will


probably
 be
 disrupted
 uh
 if
 they
 can't


change.
 So
 change
 management
 again
 is


the
 biggest
 reason
 why
 we
 see
 things
 um


you
 know
 that
 that
 haven't
 sort
 of


dramatically
 shifted
 yet.
 Um
 it's


honestly
 to
 to
 me
 it's
 not
 the
 readiness


of
 the
 technology
 itself.
 It's
 probably


you
 know
 product
 buildout
 that
 needs
 to


get
 built
 around
 the
 technologies.
 Uh


and
 then
 change
 management
 and
 and


putting
 it
 in
 production.
 So
 revenue


growth
 has
 scaled
 at
 a
 staggering
 clip


relative
 to
 other
 categories.
 Uh
 so
 this


is
 just
 it
 shows
 how
 quickly
 generative


AI
 uh
 in
 app
 revenue
 has
 grown
 uh
 from


23
 where
 it
 was
 basically
 you
 know
 you


can
 barely
 even
 see
 it
 on
 the
 page
 to
 to


now
 and
 this
 is
 a
 slide
 that
 we've


showed
 before
 but
 basically
 this


compares
 the
 clouds
 um
 public
 software


companies
 uh
 and
 then
 how
 much
 net
 new


revenue
 gets
 added
 in
 2025.
 So
 the
 far


right
 is
 what
 I
 like
 to
 look
 at,
 which


is
 public
 software
 companies
 added
 $46


billion
 of
 revenue
 in
 2025.
 If
 you
 just


add
 up
 OpenAI
 and
 Anthropic
 on
 their
 on


a
 run
 rate
 basis,
 they
 added
 almost
 half


of
 that.
 And
 I
 think
 if
 you
 were
 to
 do


that
 same
 comparison
 for
 2026,
 all
 of


the
 entire
 public
 software
 industry,
 I


mean
 SAP,
 this
 is
 not
 just
 SAS,
 like


including
 SAP,
 um,
 and
 older
 software


companies.
 I
 think
 the
 AI
 companies,
 the


model
 companies
 will
 be
 something
 like


75
 to
 80%
 as
 much.
 So,
 it's
 just


staggering
 how
 quickly
 that
 has


happened.
 These
 are
 pretty
 detailed


slides,
 these
 next
 couple
 ones.
 Um,


these
 are
 sort
 of
 slides
 showing
 what
 is


implicitly
 expected
 in
 AI
 performance


based
 on
 where
 stock
 prices
 are
 today
 um


in
 analyst
 models.
 So,
 Goldman
 Sachs


estimates
 9
 trillion
 of
 revenue
 flowing


from
 the
 buildout
 of
 AI.
 So
 if
 you


assume
 20%
 margins
 and
 a
 22
 times
 PE


that
 translates
 into
 35
 trillion
 of
 new


market
 cap
 um
 there's
 been
 about
 24


trillion
 of
 new
 market
 cap
 that's
 been


pulled
 forward.
 Now
 we
 could
 debate
 if


that's
 attributable
 all
 to
 AI
 or


otherwise
 you
 know
 large
 tech


performance.
 Um
 but
 there's
 still
 a
 lot


of
 of
 sort
 of
 market
 cap
 to
 go
 get
 um


where
 you
 could
 have
 upside
 if
 you
 know


if
 those
 assumptions
 are
 right.
 So
 this


is
 another
 sort
 of
 cut
 or
 or
 few
 cuts
 on


trying
 to
 address
 this
 sort
 of
 AI
 AI


payback
 question.
 So
 current
 estimates


put
 cumulative
 hyperscaler
 capex
 at
 a


little
 less
 than
 5
 trillion
 by
 2030.
 So


if
 you
 do
 napkin
 math
 on
 that
 to
 achieve


a
 10%
 hurdle
 rate
 on
 that
 4.8
 trillion


or
 almost
 5
 trillion
 of
 investment


annual
 AI
 revenue
 would
 have
 to
 hit


about
 a
 trillion
 dollars
 by
 2030.
 So
 to


put
 that
 into
 context,
 a
 trillion


dollars,
 that
 would
 be
 about
 1%
 of


global
 GDP
 to
 generate
 a
 10%
 return.


It's
 possible
 that
 happens.
 It's
 also


possible
 we
 could
 fall
 a
 little
 short
 of


that.
 But
 I
 think
 it's
 limiting
 just
 to


look
 to
 2030.
 I
 think
 the
 the
 payback
 of


this
 probably
 happens,
 you
 know,
 over
 a


longer
 period
 of
 time,
 like,
 you
 know,


between
 2030
 and
 2040
 as
 well.
 Um,
 but


you
 know,
 framing
 it
 up,
 that's
 about,


you
 know,
 1%,
 you
 know,
 1%
 GDP
 to
 get
 to


to
 get
 to
 the
 payback
 number
 of
 a
 10%


hurdle
 rate.
 All right.


Heard
 it
 on
 the
 street.
 What
 we've


started
 to
 do
 is
 we've
 sort
 of
 built


software
 to
 track
 what
 all
 of
 the
 AI
 or


what
 all
 of
 the
 tech
 public
 technology


companies
 discuss
 in
 their
 earnings


calls
 and
 mentions
 of
 AI,
 how
 relevant


it
 is
 to
 our
 business
 at
 the
 early
 stage


and,
 you
 know,
 the
 growth
 stage.
 And


then
 we
 package
 it
 all
 up
 and
 we
 share


it
 out
 to
 our
 CEOs.
 Um,
 so
 you
 know
 they


can
 kind
 of
 have
 a
 simple
 digestible


format
 of
 like
 what
 do
 I
 need
 to
 know


about
 AI
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 public


technology
 companies
 you
 know
 how
 does


it
 how
 does
 it
 impact
 my
 business
 etc.


And
 so
 we
 shared
 a
 bunch
 of
 the
 you
 know


the
 stuff
 that
 we
 that
 we
 track
 in
 here.


>> Awesome.
 There
 was
 one
 uh
 question


before
 we
 moved
 to
 the
 private
 section


which
 a
 lot
 of
 folks
 of
 course
 on
 this


call
 care
 about
 in
 this
 transition
 here.


Um,
 but
 before
 we
 get
 to
 that,
 so
 where


are
 we
 calibrating
 to
 your
 trillion


dollar
 in
 AI
 revenue,
 you
 know,


thereabouts
 in
 in
 2030?
 Where
 are
 we


today
 relative
 to
 your
 guesstimate
 of
 AI


enabled
 revenue?
 And
 and
 um
 how
 far
 off


are
 we
 to
 that
 trillion
 dollar
 number?


We're
 probably


in
 the


I
 would
 probably
 guess
 in
 the
 50
 billion


range.


>> Yep.


>> Just
 add
 it
 all
 up.
 And
 there's
 no


perfect
 way
 to
 do
 it.
 I
 mean,
 I
 know
 I


know
 some
 of
 the
 big
 inputs.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 to
 it.
 The
 harder
 stuff
 to
 track
 is


honestly
 the
 the
 big
 tech
 companies
 like


how
 much
 real
 AI
 revenue
 do
 they
 have?


the
 cl
 the
 clouds
 can
 kind
 of
 they
 will


from
 time
 to
 time
 give
 percentage
 uplift


from
 AI
 but
 I
 think
 depending
 on
 how


they
 want
 to
 paint
 the
 picture
 they
 can


play
 games
 with
 that
 a
 little
 bit
 so
 you


know
 I
 think
 it's
 I
 think
 it's
 I
 that's


a
 that's
 a
 rough
 swag
 but
 like
 you
 know


trillion
 we're
 probably
 at
 50
 but
 it's


growing
 you
 know
 way
 way way
 faster
 than


100%
 year-over-year.


>> Yep.
 And
 then
 arguably
 that
 revenue
 I


mean
 chat
 GPT
 launched
 three
 years
 ago


but
 substantially
 most
 of
 this
 traction


happened
 in
 the
 last
 year
 and
 a
 halfish


or
 so
 if
 we're
 being
 really
 generous


too.
 Is
 that
 a
 fair
 characterization?


>> Yeah,
 that's
 right.
 Yeah.


>> And
 look,
 you
 know,
 it's
 not
 just
 CH
 GPT


now
 on
 the
 consumer
 side.
 You
 know,


Google
 has
 a
 business,
 XAI
 has
 a


business.


>> Um,
 and
 then,
 you
 know,
 on
 the
 B2B
 side,


>> you
 know,
 not
 only
 do
 the
 big
 model


companies
 all
 have
 large
 API
 businesses,


but
 the
 clouds
 have
 it
 too.
 Um,
 and
 so
 a


lot
 of
 the,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 sales


that
 are
 model
 sales
 are
 also
 flowing


through
 the
 clouds.


>> Yep.
 Yep.
 Yep.
 Yep.
 Okay,
 cool.
 We
 have,


uh,
 some
 questions
 on
 on
 the
 private


company
 side,
 but
 I'll
 let
 you
 get


through
 the
 section
 and
 then
 I'll
 te
 you


up
 for
 it.


>> Well,
 you
 I
 I'm
 happy
 to
 go
 into


questions
 if
 you
 want
 on
 it.
 I
 mean,


this
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 stuff
 that
 we've


talked
 about,
 you
 know,
 the
 big
 themes


for
 me
 on
 the
 private
 market
 side,
 um,


you
 know,
 companies
 are
 obviously


staying
 private
 longer,
 but
 this
 is
 such


a
 real
 asset
 class
 now.
 Over
 the
 last
 20


years,
 the
 number
 of
 public
 companies


has
 been
 cut
 in
 half.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 the


the
 vast
 majority
 of
 companies
 that
 are


hundred
 million
 dollar
 plus
 revenue


companies
 are
 private,
 something
 like


86%.
 Um,
 so,
 you
 know,
 that's
 that's
 a


major
 shift.
 Um,
 we
 could
 go
 you
 can


skip
 a
 couple
 slides
 forward.
 Uh


basically
 I'll
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about


power
 laws
 because
 that's
 I
 think
 that's


interesting
 and
 maybe
 some
 new
 stuff


that
 we
 haven't
 talked
 about
 as
 much
 but


value
 very
 much
 concentrates
 in
 the


outlier
 companies.
 So
 the
 collective


valuation
 of
 North
 American
 and
 European


unicorns
 is
 about
 $5.5
 trillion.
 The
 10


largest
 ones
 if
 you
 just
 take
 those
 um


comprise
 almost
 40%
 of
 the
 entire
 value.


So
 and
 that's
 actually
 doubled
 since


2020.
 So
 sort
 of
 value
 you
 know
 sort
 of


value
 is
 being
 uh
 concentrated
 in
 the


biggest
 and
 best
 winners.
 I'm
 trying
 to


count
 real
 time
 we
 have
 four
 five
 six


seven
 of
 the
 10
 our
 portfolio
 companies


of
 that
 10
 um
 so
 you
 know
 we
 we've
 got
 a


a
 reasonable
 amount
 of
 coverage
 on
 that.


Power
 laws
 are
 happening
 in
 the
 public


markets
 too.
 So
 large
 cap
 has
 tripled


since
 2019.
 So
 what
 what
 constitutes
 a


large
 cap
 company
 has
 actually
 tripled


since
 2019.
 And
 I
 think
 this
 the
 chart


on
 the
 right
 side
 is
 super
 interesting.


This
 was
 new
 data
 analysis
 that
 we
 had


done.
 Um
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 lifespan
 of


an
 average
 company
 on
 the
 S&P
 500,


that's
 what
 that
 chart
 shows.
 That's


what
 the
 numbers
 represent.
 The
 like


once
 a
 company
 is
 on
 the
 S&P
 500,
 how


long
 is
 it
 on
 there?
 This
 is
 on
 average


is
 actually
 if
 you
 look
 over
 the
 last
 50


years
 that
 has
 declined
 by
 40%.


The
 amount
 of
 time
 it
 stays
 as
 part
 of


the
 S&P
 500.
 So
 disruption
 to
 companies


happens
 faster
 and
 faster
 and
 faster


which
 I
 think
 is
 a
 very
 interesting


dynamic
 and
 and
 sort
 of
 matches
 what


we're
 seeing
 you
 know
 just
 in
 terms
 of


like
 speed
 of
 change
 in
 in
 the
 markets


driven
 by
 technology.
 So
 we
 always
 like


to
 talk
 about
 power
 laws
 in
 our
 business


too.
 I
 didn't
 choose
 the
 title
 of
 this


slide.
 Uh,
 I
 recognize
 all
 of
 the,
 you


know,
 questions
 and
 concerns
 about
 it.


Um,
 so
 the
 the
 volatility
 laundering


thing
 is
 is
 a
 is
 a
 big
 debate
 in
 our


circles
 too.
 Um,
 mostly
 around
 founders


who
 are
 trying
 to
 debate
 the
 merits
 of


the
 private
 markets
 and
 the
 public


markets.
 And
 you
 know,
 the
 Collison's


did
 an
 interview
 where
 I
 think
 maybe
 it


was
 John
 uh
 did
 an
 interview
 where
 he


talked
 about,
 you
 know,
 managing
 your


stock
 price
 and
 avoiding
 volatility
 and


you
 can
 kind
 of
 orderly
 fashion,
 bring


your
 stock
 price
 up
 over
 time
 and
 that


makes
 it
 easier
 to
 retain
 employees,


hire
 employees,
 manage
 morale,
 uh,
 etc.,


etc.
 Um,
 and
 so
 I
 get
 the
 merits
 of


that.
 I
 I
 also
 think
 there
 are
 really


really
 strong
 merits
 of
 being
 a
 public


company
 as
 well.
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to


have
 a
 really
 really
 interesting
 18


months
 where
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 some
 of


the
 big
 kind
 of
 private
 for
 a
 very
 long


time
 companies
 that
 go
 public.
 Um
 and


that's
 a
 good
 thing
 in
 my
 opinion
 too.


Um
 some
 of
 the
 stuff
 that
 we
 show
 in


this
 chart
 is
 just
 volatility
 and
 the


observation
 that
 over
 time
 volatility


has
 gotten
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 extreme
 in


the
 markets.
 To
 me
 this
 is
 a
 little
 bit


cycle
 driven
 too.
 I
 know
 it's
 short


short
 duration
 is
 sort
 of
 what
 we're


measuring.
 Um
 but
 there's
 merits
 to
 both


companies
 can
 get
 much
 larger
 in
 the


private
 side.
 We
 have
 embraced
 that
 new


reality.
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 been
 a
 big


benefit
 to
 our
 business
 in
 terms
 of


getting
 getting
 to
 continue
 to
 invest
 in


these
 companies
 over
 time.
 Uh
 but


obviously
 you
 know
 there's
 there's
 a


path
 of
 of
 being
 a
 public
 company
 and


getting
 liquidity
 which
 we
 care
 a
 lot


about
 too.


>> Awesome.
 that
 note
 um
 there
 were
 uh
 two


questions
 uh
 I
 will
 queue
 up
 for
 you


here
 uh
 one
 on
 data
 bricks
 can
 you
 talk


about
 their
 transition
 uh
 from
 being
 a


preAI
 company
 now
 to
 a
 fully
 embedded
 AI


company
 and
 what
 that's
 been
 like


>> yeah
 um
 first
 of
 all
 I
 think
 you
 need
 to


you
 know
 I
 mentioned
 Toby
 like
 the


reason
 Shopify
 has
 embraced
 it
 is


because
 Toby
 has
 led
 from
 the
 top
 and
 he


runs
 the
 business
 you
 know
 with
 AI
 at


the
 center
 and
 and
 he
 he
 sort
 of


performance
 manages
 everyone
 uh
 to
 you


to
 make
 sure
 that
 they
 do
 that.
 Ali
 is


the
 same.
 Ali
 is
 this
 unique
 blend
 of
 um


sort
 of
 commercial
 kind
 of
 terminator.
 I


talk
 about
 I
 mean
 we
 call
 him
 the


technical
 terminator.
 You
 need
 to
 have
 a


commercial
 instinct
 and
 understand
 the


importance
 of
 the
 value
 creation


opportunity
 and
 AI
 and
 then
 you
 need
 to


actually
 be
 deep
 enough
 in
 the


technology
 to
 know
 what
 to
 build.
 And
 so


it
 just
 so
 happens
 that
 their
 um
 their


sort
 of
 cloud
 data
 warehouse
 or
 they


call
 it
 the
 data
 lake
 um
 is
 actually
 a


great
 way
 to
 have
 your
 data
 in
 a
 place


to
 run
 AI
 workloads
 on
 top
 of
 it.
 So
 you


know
 that
 was
 sort
 of
 a
 good
 place
 to
 be


for
 them
 and
 then
 they've
 very


aggressively
 iterated
 on
 new
 AI


products.
 They
 have
 this
 uh
 new
 product


called
 agent
 bricks
 which
 we're
 super


super
 excited
 about.
 we
 think
 is
 going


to
 be
 really
 big
 and
 transformative
 for


them.
 So
 um
 I
 would
 say
 that's
 a
 piece


of
 it
 and
 then
 they
 have
 the
 big
 AI


native
 companies
 all
 as
 customers
 and
 so


you
 know
 they
 have
 the
 technology
 they


have
 the
 lowcost
 technology
 um
 and
 so


you
 know
 a
 big
 thing
 that
 we
 look
 for


when
 we're
 making
 investments
 in


companies
 is
 who
 are
 their
 customers
 and


I
 would
 far
 prefer
 the
 customers
 of
 our


portfolio
 companies
 to
 be
 the
 modern


thinking
 ones
 you
 know
 the
 Door
 Dashes


of
 the
 world
 um
 you
 know
 the
 Instacarts


of
 the
 world
 the
 Ubers
 of
 the
 world
 than


the
 very
 very
 old
 school
 stodgy


companies
 because
 that
 means
 that
 their


technology
 is
 evaluated
 by
 smart


technologists
 and
 they
 pick
 it
 and
 so


the
 cutting
 edge
 AI
 companies
 are
 all


building
 on
 top
 of
 data
 bricks
 uh
 and
 so


you
 know
 they
 have
 the
 chance
 to
 grow


with
 them
 as
 they
 scale
 uh
 but
 it's
 also


a
 really
 good
 you
 know
 validator
 that


they
 have
 the
 right
 technology


>> we'll
 close
 out
 here
 thank
 you
 David
 for


taking
 us
 through
 that
