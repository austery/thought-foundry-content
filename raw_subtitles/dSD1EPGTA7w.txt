Hey
 everybody,
 welcome
 back
 to
 the


channel.
 We
 are
 back
 on
 another
 episode


of
 the
 daily
 recap.
 I
 hope
 everyone
 had


a
 great
 Thanksgiving.
 You
 know,
 I


legitimately
 did
 not
 think
 about
 the


markets
 and
 quite
 frankly
 anything
 over


the
 past
 couple
 days.
 It's
 the
 longest


4-day
 break
 that
 I've
 had
 from
 even


streaming
 or
 making
 videos
 in
 a
 while.


And
 so,
 uh,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a
 need
 a


refresher.
 Spent
 some
 time
 with
 family.


Hopefully,
 you
 guys
 got
 to
 enjoy.
 As
 you


can
 see,
 the
 beard
 is
 continuing
 to
 grow


out.
 I
 legit
 have
 gray
 hair.
 Like,
 I


like
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 how
 to
 feel
 about


it.
 I'm
 28.
 I
 don't
 know if
 that's
 the


age
 you're
 supposed
 to
 get
 gray
 hair.
 I


don't
 know if
 the
 market
 has
 aged
 me.


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 shave
 my
 beard
 just
 cuz


I
 have
 gray
 hair.
 But
 it's
 like
 it's


obvious.
 It's
 very
 visible.
 It's
 like


freaking
 Santa
 Claus.
 Like


[laughter]


this
 is
 I
 told
 you
 guys
 I'm
 becoming
 an


you
 guys
 say
 I'm
 still
 young.
 I'm


getting
 older.
 But
 lot
 to
 talk
 about


today.
 Jensen
 finally
 addressing
 the


issues
 with
 Google's
 TPUs
 versus
 Nvidia.


So
 we'll
 get
 into
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the


world
 of
 AI
 and
 what
 Jensen
 had
 to
 say.


uh
 state
 of
 the
 consumer,
 lots
 of
 new


updates
 in
 regards
 to
 the
 retailer


companies,
 Kohl's,
 Best
 Buy,
 Abocram,


etc.
 that
 have
 put
 up
 some
 really
 good


earnings
 and
 the
 Black
 Friday
 analytics


that
 we
 got
 over
 the
 past
 two
 days
 are


looking
 pretty
 strong
 for
 the
 consumer.


So,
 we'll
 talk
 more
 about
 that.
 Uh
 and


then
 crypto,
 what
 the
 hell
 is
 happening


in
 crypto?
 Got
 some
 issues
 with
 Japan.
 I


know
 people
 have
 heard
 about
 the
 yen


carry
 trade.
 We're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 talk


about
 it
 again
 today
 because
 it's


affecting
 the
 crypto
 markets
 and
 quite


frankly,
 it
 might
 affect
 the
 stock


market.
 Let's
 get
 into
 it.
 All
 right,


let's
 get
 started
 with
 Nvidia.
 Uh,
 big


announcement
 today
 from
 Jensen,
 $2


billion
 investment
 into
 Synopsis.
 Going


to
 be
 honest,
 I
 don't
 know
 everything


about
 that
 company.
 However,
 it
 is
 one


of
 the
 more
 important
 companies
 when
 it


comes
 to
 semiconductor
 manufacturing
 for


chip
 design.
 They're
 a
 leading
 provider


of
 electronic
 design
 automation,
 which


is
 EDA
 software.
 Uh,
 basically,
 it's


essential
 for
 designing
 and
 verifying


integrated
 circuits
 for
 the
 creation
 of


complex
 chips
 and
 systems.
 Nvidia
 put
 in


two
 billion.
 and
 the
 stock
 was
 up
 7%
 on


the
 day.
 Why
 did
 Nvidia
 invest?
 Well,
 uh


they've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 cash.
 They
 need
 to


put
 that
 cash
 to
 use.
 And
 as
 a
 result,


Jensen
 continued
 to
 make
 another


investment
 into
 Nvidia
 or
 into
 synopsis.


Real
 quick
 before
 we
 get
 into
 what
 he


said
 about
 Google
 and
 the
 TPUs
 because
 I


know
 that's
 the
 more
 interesting
 comment


here.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 once
 again
 today


are
 talking
 about
 this
 circular


financing
 argument
 and
 again
 it
 really


just
 doesn't
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 to
 me.


Jensen
 made
 [clears throat]
 a
 comment
 on


the
 investment
 in
 Synopsis
 by
 saying


Synopsis
 is
 helping
 design
 the


architecture
 of
 very
 complex
 chip


systems.
 Nvidia
 is
 a
 chip
 company.
 So


yes,
 will
 Nvidia
 benefit
 from
 uh
 a


company
 like
 Synopsis
 procuring
 the


services
 from
 Nvidia
 and
 buying
 chips?


Of
 course,
 but
 there's
 also
 something


very
 very
 special
 to
 CUDA,
 which
 is
 one


would
 argue
 Nvidia
 software
 mode
 that


synopsis
 is
 uniquely
 intertwined
 in.
 So,


the
 idea
 that
 Nvidia
 is
 giving
 them
 $2


billion
 and
 participating
 in
 the
 upside


of
 their
 stock
 going
 up
 and
 Synopsis


potentially
 buying
 products
 from
 Nvidia,


which
 also
 helps
 Nvidia's
 revenue
 growth


being
 circular
 to
 me
 doesn't
 make
 a
 lot


of
 sense
 if
 Synopsis
 has
 an
 actual


business
 outside
 of
 just
 buying
 from


Nvidia,
 selling
 to
 Nvidia,
 which
 is


where
 the
 sort
 of
 circular
 loop
 comes


in.
 Same
 thing
 with
 Enthropic,
 same


thing
 with
 OpenAI.
 If
 these
 companies


have
 actual
 business
 models,
 even
 if


they
 get
 an
 investment
 from
 an
 Nvidia


like
 an
 Intel,
 which
 got
 a
 $5
 billion


investment
 from
 from
 Nvidia,
 which
 is


now
 eight
 billion,
 so
 Jensen's
 up
 70%
 on


that.
 If
 they
 make
 money
 on
 other
 things


outside
 of
 the
 investment
 from
 the


investor
 and
 the
 entity
 that
 that
 that


is
 creating
 the
 the
 the
 share
 price


appreciation
 aka
 in
 this
 case
 Nvidia
 and


that's
 not
 circular.
 That's
 Nvidia


making
 an
 investment
 in
 a
 company
 that


happens
 to
 be
 a
 client
 but
 that
 company


going
 out
 providing
 products
 and


services
 to
 the
 world
 and
 then


increasing
 their
 earnings
 and
 then


Nvidia
 sharing
 the
 upside
 of
 the
 price


appreciation
 if
 the
 company
 is
 able
 to


use
 that
 investment
 to
 grow
 their
 actual


earnings.
 So
 I
 really
 don't
 think
 this


is
 circular.
 I
 think
 the
 circular


argument
 is
 starting
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 stale.


Uh
 you've
 got
 Michael
 Bur
 putting
 out


more
 substacks.
 I
 think
 his
 latest


substack
 now
 was
 about
 Nvidia
 stockbased


compensation
 being
 bearish.
 I
 mean,
 it's


just
 more
 and
 more
 arguments
 that
 are


being
 thrown
 out
 there.
 Genuinely,
 I
 am


starting
 to
 sleep
 like
 a
 baby
 at
 night


holding
 my
 Nvidia.
 I
 mean,
 last
 week
 I


really
 thought
 about
 this
 TPU
 Google


thing
 and
 I'm
 still
 doing
 more
 research


on
 it,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a
 big


deal.
 Like,
 I
 really
 don't.
 You
 had
 the


Google
 Deep
 Mind
 research
 guy
 last
 week


say
 the
 market
 selling
 off
 Nvidia
 is


stupid
 and
 he's
 a
 guy
 who
 helps
 design


TPUs.
 And
 then
 you
 have
 the
 growth
 of


the
 overall
 AI
 data
 center
 market
 that


we're
 about
 to
 talk
 about
 continuing
 to


just
 be
 tremendous.
 Which
 makes
 me
 think


even
 if
 Google
 was
 able
 to
 take
 some


market
 share,
 Nvidia
 training
 at
 25


times
 earnings
 with
 a
 quarter
 that


they're
 likely
 going
 to
 beat
 on
 $65


billion
 in
 revenue
 in
 Q4
 is
 stupid.
 And


I
 think
 eventually
 the
 market
 will
 catch


up
 to
 that.
 Catch
 up
 to
 that
 as
 well.


Here's
 what
 Jensen
 said
 about
 Google


today.


You
 know,
 listen,
 we've
 been
 uh
 we've


been
 competing
 with
 AS6
 now
 for
 quite
 a


long
 time
 and
 Google
 has
 A6
 for
 a
 long


time.
 Nvidia's
 Nvidia
 and
 they
 did
 a


great
 job
 as
 you
 know
 and
 I've
 always


been
 complimentary


>> always.


>> What
 NVIDIA
 does
 is
 much
 more
 versatile.


Our
 technology
 is
 much
 more
 funible.


Notice
 the
 announcement
 today.


Accelerating
 synopsis
 design
 tools,
 the


EDA,
 the
 SDA,
 the
 CAE
 tools
 requires
 a


computer
 architecture
 like
 CUDA.
 It's


not
 available
 for
 AS6.
 And
 so
 NVIDIA
 can


address
 markets
 that
 are
 much
 much


broader,
 not
 just
 chatbots.
 We
 are
 also


everywhere.
 We're
 in
 every
 cloud.
 We're


in
 every
 single
 OEM.
 We're
 on
 prem
 and


we're
 also
 at
 the
 edge.
 And
 so
 the


NVIDIA
 opportunity
 is
 much
 much
 larger.


And
 you're
 now
 seeing
 a
 real
 tangible


experience
 example
 of
 an
 opportunity


that
 we
 could
 do
 with
 our
 platform
 that


nobody
 else
 can.
 And
 so
 this
 is
 a
 very


big
 opportunity
 for
 us,
 huge
 opportunity


to
 reinvent
 the
 EDA
 industry,
 the
 design


and
 engineering
 industry
 for
 Synopsis


and
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 industry
 and
 a


growth
 opportunity
 for
 us
 because
 this


is
 so
 computationally
 intensive.


>> So
 pretty
 nice
 response
 from
 Jensen.
 He


uh
 you
 know
 respectful
 to
 Google


congratulates
 them
 on
 the
 on
 their


success
 but
 he
 says
 Google's
 had
 them


for
 a
 long
 time
 when
 he's
 talking
 about


them
 he
 means
 A6
 and
 what
 Nvidia
 does
 is


much
 more
 versatile.
 We
 are
 everywhere.


We
 are
 in
 every
 cloud.
 The
 Nvidia


opportunity
 is
 just
 much
 larger.
 I
 think


Jensen's
 basically
 making
 the
 argument


that
 yes
 these
 TPUs
 are
 awesome
 and
 yes


we're
 happy
 that
 Google
 is
 successful


but
 this
 is
 not
 the
 death
 of
 Nvidia
 and


people
 saying
 it's
 the
 death
 of
 Nvidia


is
 a
 bit
 premature.
 Morgan
 Stanley
 put


out
 a
 report
 today
 as
 well
 saying
 that


they
 forecast
 if
 Google
 sells


approximately
 12
 million
 TPUs
 over
 the


next
 two
 years,
 which
 would
 be
 double


their
 estimate
 of
 6.2
 million.
 Every


500,000
 TPUs
 could
 add
 13
 billion
 in


revenue
 and
 40
 cents
 to
 Google
 earnings


per
 share
 in
 2027
 alone.
 Bullish,


very
 bullish
 Google,
 not
 bearish
 Nvidia.


And
 so
 I
 didn't
 buy
 more
 Nvidia
 today.


It
 dipped
 for
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 then
 it


kind
 of
 rebounded,
 closed
 at
 around
 179.


Uh
 last
 time
 I
 bought
 was
 at
 170.
 If
 we


go
 below
 170,
 I
 will
 be
 buying
 more.
 I


don't
 know if
 the
 Santa
 Claus
 rally
 is


necessarily
 going
 to
 happen
 this
 year.


We'll
 talk
 more
 about
 what's
 going
 on
 in


the
 macro,
 but
 if
 it
 does
 happen
 or,
 you


know,
 we
 get
 any
 level
 of
 broad-based


market
 momentum,
 two
 and
 a
 half%
 away


from
 the
 S&P
 500
 getting
 to
 7,000,
 which


by
 the
 way,
 since
 1950,
 75%
 of
 the
 time,


the
 S&P
 500
 has
 averaged
 a
 1.5%
 move
 in


the
 month
 of
 December.
 So
 maybe
 that


happens
 this
 time
 as
 well.
 Then
 I
 think


Nvidia
 probably
 is
 closer
 to
 that
 190


range
 standout
 of the
 year.
 Maybe
 even


higher
 if
 we're
 able
 to
 have
 a


broad-based
 rally.
 Last
 thing
 on
 Nvidia


right
 here,
 I
 saw
 this
 note
 from
 Morgan


Stanley
 that
 I
 thought
 was
 also
 very


interesting.
 So
 again,
 they
 Morgan


Stanley
 super
 bullish
 on
 Alphabet
 and


their
 TPUs,
 but
 once
 again,
 they
 said,


"We're
 not
 bearish
 Nvidia.
 We
 continue


to
 see
 Nvidia
 maintaining
 dominant


market
 shares
 as
 threats
 are
 becoming


overstated,
 though
 we
 aren't
 exactly


sure
 what
 will
 turn
 sentiment
 around.


Our
 belief
 informed
 by
 industry


contracts
 is
 that
 Nvidia
 will
 have
 the


best
 economics
 for
 most
 applications,


and
 that
 is
 unwavering.
 And
 here's
 the


sentence
 that
 I
 thought
 was
 the
 most


important.
 company's
 biggest
 anxiety
 for


the
 next
 12
 months
 is
 their
 ability
 to


procure
 enough
 Nvidia
 product
 generally


and
 Vera
 Rubin
 specifically.


So
 you've
 got
 the
 market
 saying
 that


this
 is
 all
 a
 um
 all
 a
 bubble
 and
 Morgan


Stanley
 is
 like
 well
 the
 customers
 we're


talking
 to
 their
 biggest
 concern
 is


anxiety
 that
 they
 don't
 have
 enough


chips
 or
 that
 they
 won't
 be
 next
 up
 in


line
 to
 get
 the
 latest
 chip
 not
 that


there's
 a
 bubble
 in
 too
 many
 chips
 or


too
 many
 data
 centers.
 And
 so
 I
 think


when
 you
 look
 at
 it
 from
 that


perspective,
 and
 we'll
 keep
 covering
 it


every
 single
 day
 on
 this
 show
 because


that
 is
 the
 side
 of
 the
 argument
 that


the
 data
 is
 leading
 me
 to
 believe.
 And


I'm
 trying
 to
 be
 super
 objective
 here,


if
 I've
 got
 a
 bad
 investment
 in
 Nvidia,


I
 would
 want
 to
 know
 first
 before
 anyone


else
 so
 I
 could
 sell
 it,
 right?
 Like
 I'm


trying
 to
 be
 very
 objective
 and
 say,
 is


this
 real
 or
 is
 it
 not?
 And
 based
 on
 all


the
 data
 we're
 looking
 at,
 based
 on
 the


numbers
 that
 I'm
 looking
 at,
 it
 seems


very,
 very
 real.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 it


does
 not
 seem
 like
 it's
 going
 anywhere.


And
 it
 seems
 like
 Nvidia
 is
 going
 to


continue
 to
 grow
 and
 maintain
 this


moment.
 Last
 quick
 thing
 on
 Nvidia.
 This


is
 what
 their
 13F
 looks
 like
 now.


Synopsis,
 $2
 billion
 valuation
 or
 $2


billion
 stake.
 Coreweave
 was
 worth
 3.3


billion.
 Now
 it's
 1.8
 billion
 and
 then


Intel
 at
 about
 eight
 and
 a
 half
 billion.


So
 I
 think
 Nvid
 is
 also
 becoming
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 Birkshire
 Hathaway,
 you


know,
 kind
 of
 a
 holding
 company
 for
 a


lot
 of
 these
 equity
 stakes.
 And
 it
 makes


sense.
 They
 have
 too
 much
 cash.
 Buying


back
 the
 stock's
 not
 going
 to
 help.


Giving
 a
 dividend
 is
 not
 going
 to
 help.


they
 need
 to
 put
 that
 money
 back
 into


the
 ecosystem
 and
 not
 get
 that
 money


back
 in
 terms
 of
 chip
 sales,
 but
 get


these
 companies
 to
 be
 able
 to
 really
 use


that
 money
 to
 grow
 their
 own
 earnings.


And
 I
 think
 if
 Nvidia
 continues
 to
 do


that,
 that's
 another
 angle
 on
 how
 they


can
 grow
 earnings
 per
 share
 without


having
 to
 do
 anything,
 just
 letting


those
 companies
 continue
 to
 grow
 as
 the


equity
 stakes
 will
 uh
 influence
 Nvidia's


earnings
 a
 decade
 from
 now.
 And
 that's


another
 way
 to
 think
 that
 this
 stock


continues
 to
 be
 at
 25
 times
 earnings


next
 year,
 pretty
 cheap.
 All
 right,
 next


topic.
 Let's
 get
 into
 it.
 We
 got
 Japan.


So,
 what
 happened
 last
 night?
 Bitcoin


fell
 from
 91,000
 to
 85,000.
 That
 carnage


has
 continued
 to
 affect
 Bitcoin
 today.


Uh
 Micro
 Strategy,
 BMR,
 Ethereum,
 all


those
 stocks
 getting
 hit
 badly.
 Bitcoin


right
 now
 at
 86,000.
 So
 why
 is
 Bitcoin


selling
 off
 and
 why
 is
 it
 having
 as
 much


pain
 as
 it
 has
 been
 having
 over
 the
 past


basically
 24
 hours?
 Well,


Japanese
 bond
 yields
 are
 rising
 again.


Now,
 Japanese
 bond
 yields
 were
 rising


last
 week
 after
 the
 announcement
 of
 all


the
 stimulus.
 And
 basically,
 when
 bond


yields
 go
 up,
 that
 means
 the
 value
 of


bonds
 go
 down.
 Uh
 investors
 are
 um


selling
 off
 those
 bonds
 because
 they
 are


afraid
 of
 something.
 In
 this
 case,
 bond


yields
 tend
 to
 be
 signaling
 afraid
 of
 uh


well,
 I
 mean,
 when
 you're
 selling
 off


bonds,
 it
 tends
 to
 be
 signaling
 you're


afraid
 either
 of
 inflation,
 you're


afraid
 of
 the
 credit
 situation
 in
 a


country.
 You're
 afraid
 of
 the
 ability


for
 a
 country
 to
 pay
 back
 its
 debt.
 I


mean,
 there's
 a
 variety
 of
 reasons,
 but


the
 number
 one
 reason
 is
 you're
 not


fully
 sure
 that
 the
 monetary
 policy
 that


the
 government
 is
 engaging
 in
 is


effective.
 So,
 what
 really
 sparked
 a
 lot


of
 excitement
 last
 night,
 and
 that


excitement
 ended
 up
 being
 not
 as


exciting
 for
 the
 price
 action
 of


Bitcoin,
 is
 that
 the
 10-year
 Japanese


yield,
 10-year
 bond,
 uh,
 ended
 up


yielding
 its
 highest
 percentage
 since


April
 of
 2008.
 Folks,
 the
 10-year
 on


Japanese
 markets
 ended
 up
 going
 up
 to


1.8%.
 So,
 this
 was
 not
 good
 to
 see.
 And


and
 the
 reason
 this
 was
 not
 good
 to
 see


is
 because
 you
 cannot
 have
 these
 yields


spiking
 at
 astronomical
 levels.
 The
 more


they
 spike,
 the
 more
 investor
 confidence


gets
 scared
 about
 what
 the
 heck
 is
 going


on
 in
 the
 country
 of
 the
 yield
 or
 the


bond
 that
 is
 spiking.
 And
 and
 and
 and


part
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 the
 um
 country
 is


having
 some
 issues
 right
 now
 from
 a


macro
 perspective
 is
 that
 Japan
 is
 one


of
 the
 largest
 owners
 of
 US
 treasuries.


So,
 if
 people
 aren't
 trusting
 Japanese


debt
 and
 and
 and
 saying,
 "We're
 going to


sell
 off
 your
 bonds
 because
 we
 don't,


you
 know,
 we
 don't
 think
 what
 you're


doing
 is
 right
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 monetary


policy."
 Well,
 that
 country
 has
 to
 get


the
 money
 to
 finance
 their
 obligations


in
 some
 capacity.
 Obviously,
 most


countries
 are
 financing
 it
 through
 debt.


Uh,
 the
 United
 States
 obviously
 issues
 a


lot
 of
 debt.
 The
 reason
 we
 usually
 get
 a


market
 for
 our
 debt
 is
 because
 people


know
 that
 we're
 the
 United
 States
 and


everyone's
 going
 to
 buy
 our
 debt
 or


we're
 at least
 going
 to
 be
 good
 for
 our


debt,
 so
 people
 want
 to
 buy
 it.


um
 you
 are
 starting
 to
 get
 some
 fears


that
 Japan
 might
 not
 be
 good
 for
 the


interest
 that
 they
 owe
 on
 the
 debt
 or
 at


least
 investors
 are
 saying,
 "Hey,
 if


you're
 going
 to
 take
 our
 money,
 we
 need


a
 lot
 more
 interest.
 We
 need
 a
 lot
 more


yield
 on
 these
 bonds.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to


sell
 these
 bonds
 until
 you
 give
 us
 this


yield,
 aka
 these
 rates
 go
 higher
 for
 us


to
 be
 more
 excited
 to
 buy
 your
 bonds."


Uh,
 now
 if
 Japan
 had
 to
 sell
 the
 1.1


trillion
 of
 US
 bonds
 that
 they
 have
 on


their
 balance
 sheet
 to
 be
 able
 to


finance
 whatever
 they're
 doing,
 that


would
 also
 not
 be
 the
 best
 thing
 in
 the


world
 for
 our
 bond
 markets
 because
 then


our
 bond
 yields
 would
 spike
 and
 then


that
 would
 create
 issues
 in
 a
 variety
 of


uh
 assets
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Now,
 how


does
 this
 affect
 the
 stock
 market?
 It


goes
 back
 to
 the
 yen
 carry
 trade.
 I


think
 people
 have
 heard
 about
 this
 by


now.
 April
 2020
 or
 August
 2024
 is
 when


this
 kind
 of
 first
 started.
 But
 the
 yen


and
 shorting
 the
 yen,
 which
 is
 the


Japanese
 currency,
 has
 been
 one
 of
 the


best
 ways
 for
 hedge
 funds
 in
 particular


to
 go
 long
 US
 tech
 stocks
 because
 the


arbitrage
 between
 the
 yen
 and
 the
 dollar


is
 something
 that
 could
 easily
 be


exploited
 because
 Japan
 always
 has
 tried


to
 make
 sure
 their
 yen
 depreciated


against
 the
 dollar.
 Now,
 the
 yen
 is


appreciating
 because
 not
 only
 are
 they


uh
 issuing
 stimulus
 in
 the
 country,


which
 is
 getting
 the
 bond
 market
 to
 be


like,
 "What
 the
 hell
 is
 going
 on
 here?"


Like,
 you
 guys
 can't
 afford
 to
 do
 this.


Um,
 but
 Japan's
 also
 raised
 rates
 and


they're
 likely
 going
 to
 raise
 rates


again
 on
 December
 19th.
 And
 I
 I've
 tried


to
 understand
 why
 they're
 doing
 this


because
 it
 kind
 of
 seems


counterintuitive.
 Why
 would
 you
 print


money
 and
 then
 raise
 rates
 at
 the
 same


time?
 Uh,
 but
 there's
 a
 unique


relationship
 Japan
 Japan
 has
 between


deflation,
 interest
 rates,
 their
 labor


market,
 their
 stagnant
 wages
 over
 the


past
 20
 years
 and
 the
 rising
 inflation


that
 has
 started
 to
 happen
 after


basically
 20
 years
 of
 deflation.
 And
 so


they
 kind
 of
 got
 to
 do
 multiple
 things


at
 once.
 I'm
 not
 fully,
 you
 know,
 an


expert
 on
 exactly
 how
 they're
 navigating


it,
 but
 the
 market's
 obviously
 not
 the


happiest
 about
 what
 they're
 doing.
 On


top
 of
 that,
 Japan
 has
 a
 massive


population
 crisis.
 The
 reason
 the


Japanese
 prime
 minister,
 by
 the
 way,


even
 is
 the
 current
 prime
 minister
 right


now,
 the
 the
 first
 woman
 prime
 minister,


is
 because
 the
 previous
 prime
 minister


tried
 to
 increase
 immigration
 because
 he


was
 like,
 "People
 are
 getting
 older.


Young
 people
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 these


jobs.
 We're
 going
 to
 need
 some


immigration
 to
 to
 to
 bolster
 up
 the


working
 class
 of
 Japan."
 So
 he
 wanted
 to


import
 500,000
 Nigerians
 and
 Indians


into
 the
 country.
 Country
 got
 really


mad.
 Japan
 people
 revolted.
 The
 prime


minister
 had
 to
 resign
 out
 of
 disgrace.


That's
 like
 a
 real
 thing.
 He
 like
 was


disgraced.
 He
 had
 to
 apologize
 to
 the


country.
 And
 you
 had
 a
 new
 prime


minister
 that
 promised
 no
 massive
 crazy


immigration
 and
 lots
 of
 stimulus.
 So
 the


market's
 not
 really
 buying
 exactly


what's
 going
 on
 right
 now
 in
 Japan.
 If


the
 yen
 continues
 to
 appreciate
 against


the
 dollar,
 hedge
 funds
 that
 were
 short


the
 yen
 long
 something
 like
 Bitcoin


because
 the
 cost
 of
 borrowing
 is


significantly
 cheaper
 than
 the
 cost
 of


borrowing
 in
 the
 United
 States,
 they


have
 to
 sell
 their
 Bitcoin
 or
 sell
 their


Nvidia
 or
 sell
 whatever
 tech
 stock


they're
 long
 on
 and
 buy
 back
 their


short,
 cover
 their
 short
 position
 if


rates
 go
 higher.
 And
 that
 arbitrage
 is


what's
 potentially
 creating
 the
 decline


in
 very
 heavy
 risk
 on
 assets
 like
 a


Bitcoin.
 Now,
 the
 one
 thing
 Nvidia
 has


going
 for
 it
 is
 that
 Nvidia
 is
 cheap
 on


a
 in
 my
 opinion
 fundamental
 basis.
 If


you
 look
 at
 the
 earnings,
 Bitcoin
 is


pure
 speculation.
 Now,
 I
 don't
 say
 that


as
 someone
 who's
 bearish
 Bitcoin.
 In


fact,
 quite
 the
 opposite.
 But,
 um,
 quite


lit
 legitimately,
 you
 don't
 have
 any


earnings
 to
 say
 Bitcoin's
 cheap
 compared


to
 Nvidia
 or
 Bitcoin's
 cheap
 compared
 to


like
 Apple.
 It's
 like,
 no,
 it's
 just


like
 it's
 pure
 gut
 emotion
 and
 how


people
 feel.
 And
 if
 the
 number
 one
 thing


they
 need
 to
 do
 to
 get
 liquidity,
 which


it's
 a
 very
 liquid
 market
 open
 24
 hours,


is
 sell
 a
 risk-on
 asset
 versus
 Nvidia,


which
 is
 also
 a
 risk
 on
 asset.
 But
 if


you
 think
 Nvidia
 is
 cheap,
 then
 maybe


people
 are
 holding
 on
 to
 their
 video
 and


they're
 selling
 their
 most
 speculative


positions
 like
 a
 Bitcoin
 or
 Ethereum
 or


Salana.
 That
 is
 what's
 creating
 the


carnage
 in
 the
 crypto
 market.
 that
 along


with
 the
 deleveraging
 uh
 thesis
 that
 Tom


Lee
 has
 had.
 I
 know
 you
 put
 those
 two


together,
 maybe
 that
 thesis
 is
 fully


correct,
 maybe
 it's
 not
 fully
 correct,


but
 there's
 definitely
 margin
 and


leverage
 on
 these
 crypto
 assets
 that's


now
 not
 as
 easily
 accessible
 based
 on


what's
 happening
 in
 Japan.


Is
 this
 going
 to
 blow
 up
 the
 US
 stock


market?
 I
 don't
 think
 so.
 But
 I
 don't


fully
 know.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 I


definitely
 don't
 think
 the
 yen
 carry


trade
 is
 something
 that
 can
 unwind
 to


the
 point
 where
 the
 entire
 United
 States


S&P
 500
 stock
 market
 takes
 a
 meaningful


draw
 down.
 Has
 it
 affected
 kind
 of
 the


investor
 sentiment
 around
 a
 lot
 of
 these


risk
 on
 assets?
 Sure.
 But
 the
 S&P
 500
 is


less
 than
 1%
 away
 from
 high.
 So,
 so,
 so


to
 me
 it's
 it's
 it's
 something
 that's
 an


issue
 for
 particularly
 risk
 on
 assets


that
 have
 global
 liquidity
 like
 a


Bitcoin.
 Not
 necessarily
 a
 stock
 market


that
 is
 putting
 up
 record
 earnings


that's
 getting
 a
 Fed
 that's
 ready
 to


cut.
 Like,
 you
 have a
 lot
 of
 different


things
 going
 on
 for
 why
 I
 think
 the
 US


is
 going
 to
 be
 okay
 in
 terms
 of
 our


stock
 market,
 but
 I
 think
 that's


creating
 the
 carnage
 in
 crypto.


Hopefully,
 that
 doesn't
 bleed
 into
 the


stock
 market.
 And
 if
 it
 does,
 we're


going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 how
 the
 United


States
 deals
 with
 this
 when
 it
 comes
 to


All right,
 last
 thing
 we're
 going
 to


talk
 about
 is
 some
 macro
 updates
 in


terms
 of
 headlines.
 First
 of
 all,
 JPA
 is


speaking
 today.
 In
 fact,
 he's
 probably


speaking
 right
 now
 as
 I'm
 recording


this.
 Um,
 I
 doubt
 he's
 going
 to
 say


anything
 that
 meaningful
 around
 the


markets.
 I
 mean,
 maybe
 he
 will.
 If
 he


does,
 we'll
 talk
 about
 it
 tomorrow
 on


the
 market
 open,
 but
 uh
 if
 he
 doesn't,


then
 it's
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 be


something
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 that


important.
 The
 Fed
 meeting
 is
 on


February
 10th.
 I
 will
 February
 10th.


Maybe
 there
 is
 a
 Fed
 meeting
 on
 February


10th
 as
 well.
 December
 10th,
 which
 is
 a


week
 from
 now.
 Um,
 there
 is
 actually
 no


Fed
 meeting
 in
 February.
 It's
 January,


March,
 and
 then
 April.
 So,
 uh,
 87.6
 6%


chance,
 highest
 it's
 been
 in
 weeks.
 It


looks
 like
 we
 are
 going
 to
 get
 this
 rate


cut,
 which
 is
 super
 bullish
 because


again,
 if
 Japan's
 hiking,
 then
 we


definitely
 need
 to
 be
 cutting.
 And
 in


general,
 I
 think
 this
 market
 is
 not


priced
 for
 us
 not
 getting
 the
 rate
 cut.


So,
 we're
 going
 to
 need
 to
 get
 that
 rate


cut
 in
 a
 meaningful
 way.
 Uh,
 so
 rate


cuts
 on
 the
 way.
 QT,
 by
 the
 way,


quantitative
 tightening
 officially
 stops


today,
 December
 1st,
 which
 is
 the
 Fed


selling
 off
 mortgage
 back
 securities
 on


their
 balance
 sheet.
 more
 liquidity


entering
 the
 system
 from
 rate
 cuts


hopefully
 and
 from
 the
 end
 of
 QT
 which


is
 also
 going
 to
 be
 very
 very
 important


for
 assets
 like
 Bitcoin
 that
 need
 to
 do


better.
 By
 the
 way,
 last
 thing
 I
 got
 to


say,
 I
 I
 forgot
 to
 mention
 this
 on


Japan.
 Um
 they're
 moving
 to
 a
 20%
 flat


tax
 on
 crypto.
 So
 again,
 you
 got
 even


more
 nuance
 to
 kind
 of
 how
 they're


navigating
 the
 the
 stimulus
 in
 the


country.
 But
 that
 could
 theoretically
 be


bearish
 crypto
 because
 then
 people
 are


selling
 because
 they
 know
 they
 don't


have
 to
 pay
 a
 lot
 of taxes
 or
 that's


bullish
 because
 you
 get
 a
 lot
 more
 money


coming
 into
 the
 system
 knowing
 that


they're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 to
 pay
 massive


taxes
 whenever
 they
 do
 sell
 for
 a


profit.
 And
 so
 you've
 got
 that
 happening


in
 crypto.
 Vanguard
 is
 also
 allowing


people
 as
 of
 tomorrow
 to
 start
 buying


the
 Bitcoin
 ETF.
 The
 Vanguard
 CEO
 said
 a


couple
 months
 ago
 or
 a
 year
 ago,
 they


would
 never
 let
 people
 buy
 Bitcoin
 on


the
 platform.
 They've
 had
 to
 adapt
 and


that
 adaptation
 is
 starting
 to
 be
 very


helpful
 for
 an
 asset
 like
 Bitcoin.
 Other


macro
 stats,
 VO
 monthly
 record
 flows
 in


November
 20.8
 8
 billion,
 second
 highest


in
 the
 last
 four
 years,
 fifth


consecutive
 monthly
 inflow.
 And
 year
 to


date,
 VO
 net
 inflows
 are
 now
 up
 17%
 to


124
 billion
 on
 track
 for
 its
 biggest


yearly
 inflow
 since
 inception.


As
 the
 market
 worries
 about
 an
 AI


bubble,
 you
 have
 investors
 that
 continue


to
 buy
 essentially
 America
 betting
 on


the
 biggest
 tech
 companies
 in
 the
 world


and
 that
 these
 tech
 companies
 will


continue
 to
 do
 what
 they
 need
 to
 do.
 So,


I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 noise
 is
 out
 there


around
 AI
 bubble.
 I
 listen
 to
 Jensen


speak.
 I
 look
 at
 the
 earnings.
 I
 look
 at


where
 the
 money
 is
 being
 allocated
 to.


Hedge
 funds.
 By
 the
 way,
 Goldman
 Sachs


said
 last
 week
 that
 they
 bought
 the
 dip


at
 the
 highest
 record
 over
 the
 past


couple
 years
 in
 the
 in
 the
 last
 two


days,
 which
 was
 like
 the
 last
 two
 days


of
 the
 week
 where
 the
 S&P
 hit
 like
 650.


Um,
 so
 I
 think
 that
 was
 that
 Thursday


and
 Friday
 of
 two
 weeks
 ago.
 They
 bought


the
 dip.
 I
 mean,
 you're
 just
 starting
 to


see
 more
 and
 more
 data
 come
 out
 saying


that
 these
 opportunities
 end
 up
 being


opportunities
 that
 people
 want
 to
 take


advantage
 of.
 This
 is
 a
 chart
 from
 Ryan


Dietrich
 right
 here.
 I
 also
 thought
 was


really
 important.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 have


been
 asking,
 "Hey
 Emit,
 when
 does
 the


Santa
 Claus
 rally
 happen?"
 First
 of
 all,


don't
 know
 if
 the
 Santa
 Claus
 rally
 is


definitely
 going
 to
 happen.
 One
 thing
 to


remember
 about
 that
 piece
 of
 data
 is


that
 usually
 the
 Santa
 Claus
 rally,


which
 is
 a
 1.4%
 rally
 the
 month
 of


December,
 uh,
 happening
 75%
 of
 the
 time


since
 1950,
 historically
 is
 based
 on


September
 and
 October
 sucking.
 So
 you


get
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 sort
 of
 reversal
 of


September
 and
 October
 sucking
 going
 into


the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 You
 also
 have
 fund


managers
 chasing.
 There's
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 other
 arguments.
 Um
 maybe
 that


doesn't
 happen
 because
 September,


October,
 and
 November
 were
 all
 green.


Even
 November
 inched
 out
 a
 03%
 green


month
 with
 all
 the
 pain
 that
 we
 had
 to


go
 through.
 So
 I
 I
 do
 think
 people


should
 just
 remember
 December
 this
 time


might
 not
 be
 a
 Santa
 Claus
 rally
 because


we
 had
 three
 green
 months
 in
 a
 row.
 Now


granted,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 reasons
 why
 I


think
 it
 could
 happen.
 The
 rate
 cut,


earnings,
 etc.,
 But
 historically,
 it's


been
 the
 volatility
 around
 September


through
 November
 that
 creates
 that


December
 momentum.
 If
 we
 were
 to
 get
 a


set
 and
 close
 rally,
 it
 should
 happen
 by


the
 last
 two
 weeks
 of
 the
 year.
 So,
 as


you
 can
 see,
 December
 1st
 to
 December


15th,
 relatively
 flat.
 And
 then
 December


15th
 to
 the
 31st
 is
 when
 you
 get
 your


real
 move.
 So,
 if
 it
 does
 happen,
 we


should
 be
 expecting
 it
 over
 the
 next


couple
 weeks.
 And
 then
 we
 get
 into
 2026,


which
 I
 think
 is
 going
 to
 be
 something


that
 is,


I
 think,
 nuanced,


has
 a
 lot
 of
 variables.
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


making
 a
 lot
 more
 videos
 soon
 on
 uh


navigating
 2026
 and
 kind
 of
 just


portfolio
 construction,
 my
 ideas
 for


where
 2026
 is
 going,
 uh
 positions
 I
 have


going
 into
 the
 year.
 I
 I
 think
 I
 give


you
 guys
 a
 little
 preview
 right
 now.
 I


think
 Meta,
 Microsoft,
 Amazon,
 and


Nvidia.
 And
 if
 I
 had
 to
 pick
 three
 of


those,
 Meta,
 Amazon,
 and
 Nvidia,
 I
 think


those
 are
 easy
 in
 2026.
 And
 we'll
 we'll


we'll
 talk
 a
 lot
 more
 about
 it.
 I
 don't


even
 think
 it's
 controversial
 saying


that.
 Amazon
 being
 my
 favorite
 of
 them


because
 Nvidia
 already
 have
 a
 big


position
 and
 Meta
 have
 a
 position,
 not
 a


massive
 position.
 Amazon,
 I
 just
 think


AWS
 growth
 plus
 robotics
 increasing


operating
 margins.
 It's
 it's
 it's
 the


next
 one
 to
 go
 to
 300.
 We
 saw
 Google
 do


it.
 I
 think
 Amazon's
 going
 to
 do
 it
 next


year.
 So,
 I
 think
 those
 three
 are
 going


to
 be
 some
 obvious
 longs
 going
 into


2026.
 Uh,
 last
 thing,
 Cyber
 Monday,


Black
 Friday,
 absolutely
 monster
 monster


results
 from
 the
 consumer.
 I
 mean,
 I


didn't
 expect
 it
 to
 be
 this
 good,
 but


it's
 pretty
 freaking
 good.
 So,
 take
 a


look
 at
 this
 for
 Black
 Friday.
 Uh,
 Toby


Luke,
 the
 CEO
 of
 Shopify.
 Shopify,
 by


the
 way,
 it
 was
 down
 5%
 today.
 I
 think


because
 they
 had
 a
 little bit
 of
 an


outage,
 which
 means
 actually
 kind
 of


bullish
 because
 it
 means
 that
 they
 have


so
 much
 demand
 on
 their
 platform.
 25%


yearover-year
 growth
 for
 merchants
 on


Black
 Friday.


6.2
 billion
 in
 sales.
 Edge
 peaked
 at
 480


million
 requests
 per
 minute.
 Peak


database
 queries
 53
 million
 per
 second.


API
 process
 over
 31
 million
 requests
 per


minute
 at
 the
 peak.
 I
 mean,
 where
 is


this
 weak
 consumer?
 Because
 you
 had


Abberrombi,
 Kohl's,
 Best
 Buy,


Burlington.
 We'll
 see
 Urban
 Outfitters


last
 week.
 We'll
 see
 tomorrow
 with


American
 Eagle
 what
 ends
 up
 happening.


But
 I
 did
 not
 expect
 these
 clothing


companies
 to
 have
 these
 record
 Q3s.
 I


mean,
 it
 really
 it's
 just
 like
 where
 is


this
 stuff
 coming
 from?
 But
 it
 continues


to
 be
 strong.
 And
 if
 all
 these
 companies


are
 coming
 out
 and
 they're
 showing
 the


types
 of
 earnings
 growth
 that
 is
 very


very
 important
 for
 them
 to
 continue


proving
 that
 the
 consumer
 is
 not
 as
 weak


as
 some
 people
 think,
 even
 though
 the


consumer
 might
 not
 be
 perfect,
 which


100%
 the
 consumer
 is
 obviously
 not


perfect.
 If
 the
 consumer
 is
 better
 than


expected,


well,
 and
 we're
 easing
 and
 corporate


earnings
 are
 good.
 And
 as
 you
 can
 see


right
 here,
 Black
 Friday
 sales
 hit
 a


record
 high
 11.8
 billion
 as
 per
 Adobe


Analytics.
 Salesforce
 reported
 18


billion
 in
 total
 Black
 Friday
 spending.


We'll
 get
 Amazon's
 numbers
 probably


tomorrow.


And
 by
 the
 way,
 Amazon
 did
 come
 out
 and


say
 that
 Rufus,
 their
 LLM,
 has
 actually


influenced
 how
 their
 Black
 Friday
 sales


have
 gone
 and
 just
 made
 it
 more


efficient
 for
 customers.
 So
 that's
 AI


being
 a
 tailwind
 for
 their
 e-commerce


sales.
 Um
 it
 it it
 does
 feel
 like
 if
 the


consumer
 is
 not
 as
 bad
 as
 we
 think,


maybe
 we're
 not
 going to
 get
 that
 many


rate
 cuts
 going
 into
 next
 year,
 although


once
 Trump
 replaces
 power,
 get
 a
 lot


more
 rate
 cuts.
 But
 if
 the
 consumer
 is


not
 that
 bad,
 it's
 bad,
 but
 it's
 not


that
 bad.
 There's
 this
 nuance
 of
 okay,


we
 can
 cut
 rates,
 the
 labor
 market


doesn't
 collapse.
 We
 can
 probably
 save


the
 labor
 market
 from
 collapsing.
 If
 we


cut
 rates,
 the
 consumer
 is
 not
 horrible.


So,
 they
 can
 keep
 spending.
 Company


earnings
 can
 keep
 showing
 uh
 momentum


and
 growth.
 And
 then
 you've
 got
 rates


coming
 down
 which
 should
 overall
 create


more
 liquidity
 and
 easing
 in
 the


financial
 system.
 And
 then
 if
 this
 AI


stuff
 increases
 productivity,
 margins,


maybe
 we
 have
 to
 worry
 about
 deflation,


not
 inflation.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


things
 that
 can
 happen
 in
 2026,
 but
 this


consumer's
 week
 narrative
 is
 being


challenged.
 Chipotle
 and
 Starbucks
 told


us
 the
 consumer
 is
 weak.
 Urban


Outfitters
 and
 Abbercrombrian
 Fish,


which
 sells
 $75
 hoodies,
 are
 telling
 us


the
 consumer
 is
 fine.
 Now,
 maybe
 it's


one
 part
 of
 the
 consumer
 that's


subsidizing
 the
 other
 part
 of
 the


consumer.
 That's
 a
 fair
 point,
 but
 it


was
 like
 seven
 companies
 last
 week.
 XRT,


the
 retailer
 ETF,
 had
 its
 best
 two-day


stretch
 since
 May
 of
 2025.
 ISM
 PMI
 data


this
 morning
 was
 not
 necessarily
 the


best.
 We
 we
 missed
 on
 expectations,
 but


these
 retailer
 earnings
 are
 pretty
 good.


So,
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 need
 more


data
 to
 see
 what's
 happening
 in
 the


world
 of
 retail,
 but
 if
 we're


challenging
 this
 consumer's
 week


narrative,
 that's
 not
 the
 worst
 thing


for
 corporate.
 All right,
 that's
 it
 for


me.
 Thank
 you everybody
 for
 listening


and
 watching.
 We
 are
 back
 with
 the
 daily


recaps.
 Happy
 to
 be
 back.
 Uh,
 I
 think it


was
 a
 much
 needed
 break
 for
 everyone
 to


kind
 of
 just
 relax
 and
 spend
 time
 with


their
 family,
 but
 we're
 back.
 We
 got
 one


month
 left
 of
 the
 year.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 of


stuff
 to
 plan,
 a
 lot
 of
 new
 updates


coming
 in
 terms
 of
 um
 this
 YouTube


channel
 as
 well
 going
 to
 2026.
 And
 I'll


give
 more
 details
 about
 that
 over
 the


weeks.
 but
 excited
 to
 be
 back
 and
 got


one
 month
 left.
 We're
 entering
 2026
 and


we're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 we
 can
 all


navigate
 2026.
 I'll
 be
 here
 every
 single


day
 and
 uh
 do
 my
 part
 to
 help
 in


whatever
 way
 I
 can,
 but
 I
 think
 there


are
 some
 good
 ideas
 and
 opportunities


going
 into
 2026
 and
 we'll
 continue
 to


nab
 you
 as
 we
 can
 every
 single
 Thank
 you


everybody.
 I'll
 see
 you
 guys
 on
 the
 next
