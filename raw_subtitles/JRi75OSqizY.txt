A video by Zhongda Jia Ning three months ago
It set off a storm in the Taiwanese YouTuber circle
I wonder if I have joined a cult or taken a spiritual growth course.
Many YouTubers came out to share their experiences after joining the spiritual courses
Recently, Ceylon made another video to reveal the inside story of the three-stage course.
This sparked a bigger discussion, prompting the Ministry of Health and Welfare to intervene in the investigation
In these controversies, there are often several arguments in favor of the curriculum.
The first is to say
Although some people had mental breakdowns, many people also found the course effective.
Those who are psychologically fragile may not be suitable for this kind of class.
This kind of discussion will always be about everyone talking about their own things and will not be able to focus.
The second argument is that when these courses are revealed to be unlicensed
When there is no informed consent
They will emphasize that this course is not psychological counseling
It's personal growth
Deliberately walking in the gray area of ​​the law
There is another argument that would say that Ceylon raised only extreme cases
Not all three-stage courses look like this
You can't overturn the whole boat with one pole
Yes, there are many variations of spiritual courses.
So to see the essence of things, we must trace the origin of all this
Just know how it all started.
Only then can we understand why this controversy has arisen in Taiwan today
Currently, the information about these courses in the Chinese world is still unclear.
In fact, the same three-stage course has been sold all over the world for the past 50 years.
United States, Europe, Hong Kong, China, Japan, Malaysia
The same psychological manipulation has been exposed many times before.
Where did this spiritual course come from?
Who is selling these things? What controversies have they caused?
Why is it becoming popular in Asian countries now after being exposed in Europe and the United States?
Learn more about this topic
We will find that reality is often stranger than imagination.
In today's video, we are going to talk about
The Untold History Behind the Spiritual Growth Course
You need to know where the spiritual courses come from.
Let’s start with another story.
In 1964, an American businessman William P. Patrick
I saw my neighbor clearing out a lot of skin care products made from organic fruits.
Just buy them all.
I started my own company, Holiday Magic
Advertise everywhere, offer high salary to recruit salespersons to sell skin care products
But skin care products are just a cover
In fact, they want to recruit downline members and engage in multi-level pyramid selling.
Also known as the Rat Club
But it’s too slow to make money just by pulling down the line
Is there a faster way to make money?
In the 1960s, hippie culture was popular in California, USA
One of the branches is called the Human Potential Movement
Believes that humans only use 10% of their abilities
The other 90% of potential has not yet been stimulated.
So young people at that time would try psychedelic drugs, ayahuasca
I hope to enter a state of consciousness that ordinary people cannot reach.
In this spiritual craze
Alexander Everett, the father of the human potential movement
I designed a spiritual course for the white-collar class.
His training organization is called Mind Dynamics
Direct translation is "heart power"
See the rise of spiritual courses
William Patrick had a sudden idea
Please ask this organization to help design a set of spiritual courses for enterprises
This way, you can collect tuition fees from employees and make more money.
It can also improve employee loyalty and make them more obedient to the company.
It's really killing two birds with one stone
He stipulated that if employees wanted to be promoted
A four-day training course
At a hotel in Palo Alto, California
Each student has to pay a tuition fee of $1,000
A student who participated
Record the course content in detail in the book The Pit
It was later adapted into the movie Circle of Power.
Here
You can see the prototypes of most of the current spiritual courses
First of all, you can't go to the toilet during class time.
Because going to the bathroom is seen as an excuse to skip classes
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I have to go to the bathroom. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Sit down , buddy .</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Whenever there's something you people don't want to feel</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>you look for ways to distract yourself.</font> <font color=#F9FF00FF>you look for ways to distract yourself.</font>
Your entire repertoire is nothing but an
excuse
<font color=#F9FF00FF>to keep your minds off the painful truth about yourselves.</font>
Next is to reveal your privacy
Deny your original personality
Claiming that this is the only way to face the real self
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Are you satisfied with being a housewife?
Enjoy being a housewife ?
On the whole, yes .
<font color=#F9FF00FF> You 're lying. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Do you have an orgasm every time you have sex?
Do you come every time you fuck ?
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Are you serious? </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>For real?</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>It's none of your business. </font> <font color=#F9FF00FF>It's my business
. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF> You have no business other than what I tell you
, for as long as you're here .</font>
So called privacy is a shield against letting others know who we really are .
If you resist
You will be accused of not being willing to take responsibility for your own life.
<font color=#F9FF00FF>It's not my fault. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>You agreed housewife and mother, not just as long as it's convenient . </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>You have a responsibility. </font>
After the students disclosed their psychological trauma
The instructor will praise you gently.
Say you are brave
Willing to talk about your trauma
The other members will come up and hug you.
Makes you feel like you are not alone
Finally, I will give you a shout of confidence
Shout you want to succeed
The most shocking thing in the course
It's putting people in coffins and burying them alive.
Sleeping in a coffin for a night
They say you have to experience death, imprisonment first
After you are released, you will learn to cherish life.
Cherish the people around you
Many of the abused practitioners later took the case to court
The US government banned this.
So in the contemporary version
This challenge no longer exists
It was changed to a lifeboat game.
You are the one who was not rescued on board.
Imagine yourself in a coffin after death.
As Holiday Magic attracts more and more offline players
Growing popularity
More and more people are beginning to realize
This company is actually a rat club.
Finally, it was exposed in 1973
Banned by the US government
At that time, 26 people in the black community in the UK had all their money swindled out
Final suicide
The whole incident is known as the largest pyramid scam in the United States in the 1970s.
So how did the spiritual growth course here come about?
The main designer of this course is Ben Gay
He's actually a sadist.
No background in psychology
When Alexander Everett, the person in charge, was later asked about this matter
His response was
Ben Gay is a sadist and he screwed up the whole training system
So the spiritual course we are talking about today
You thought it was designed by a psychologist?
It was actually designed by a psychopath
This is just the prototype of the course.
After Holiday Magic ceased operations
The story of the spiritual growth course
Now is the time to start
After Holiday Magic was disbanded
The original group of training instructors did not disband
Instead, the original course was modified into a version that is less likely to break the law.
Since direct selling may violate the law
Don't sell products then.
Wouldn't it be better to just sell the courses directly?
These lecturers began to open companies across the United States
Popularize spiritual growth courses everywhere
The most famous of these is EST, a company founded by Werner Erhard.
He modified the course to better meet the needs of the public
Taking advantage of the then popular New Age movement elements
Combining Carnegie, Zen, hypnosis and Heidegger philosophy
200 students per class
Claims to free people from their past selves
Transformed and reborn
His personal transformation training called EST and its successor The forum,
<font color=#F9FF00FF> These classes shaped the seventies and eighties. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>It was all about seizing control of your life, taking responsibility. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>More than a million people trust his spiritual growth techniques</font> <font color=#F9FF00FF>Millions swore by Erhard's technique.</font>
that's all
The LGAT course has evolved from a white-collar class course to a popular version for the general public.
This is the three-stage course we see now.
Erhard's course has become a pilgrimage site for many celebrities
Yoko Ono, and Kiyosaki, author of Rich Dad Poor Dad
All have participated in Erhard's three-stage course
<font color= #F9FF00FF> Personal thanks , a very private one, </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF> to
someone who profoundly influenced my life, Werner Erhard.</font>
Hollywood also made this man's story
Remake into a comedy film
<font color=#F9FF00FF>一群屎蛋</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>assholes.</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>You're all assholes. Everyone of you. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Why can't we go to the toilet? </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Why can't we go to the bathroom if we have to?</font>
Because
you can't
So what is the charm of this course?
Why do so many people want to go there?
In the new three-stage course
Erhard created his own unique philosophy
It is called "You are the source of everything"
First, he would ask students to talk about their own life difficulties.
Then they will scold them for not knowing how to perceive the difference between reality and interpretation.
Your self-worth and feelings
It comes from how you interpret your life
This is actually copied from Heidegger's philosophy.
But Erhard turned it into a psychological manipulation technique.
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Based on what you just told us
, it seems obvious</font> <font color=#F9FF00FF>It's clearly implied from what that's what's up before.</font>
No, Frank, it's only clearly implied from your point of view .
<font color=#F9FF00FF>是沒錯</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Yes, exactly. Yes.</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>so , now look.</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>My friend, you are the guy
creating that notion, not me.</font>
No matter what life dilemma you tell
It's all because you interpreted it as a bad thing.
Treat reality as just your own interpretation
Allow Erhard to derive the second concept
Since it is my point of view that creates the way I see things
When I feel hurt, traumatized
That's all because of my victim complex
I'm just avoiding responsibility for my own life.
This allows mentors to publicly shame those with trauma
Saying that being sexually assaulted and traumatized was their own choice
<font color=#F9FF00FF>When I was a little girl, my parents put me in an orphanage several times. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Isn’t this beautiful? </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>isn't that beautiful?</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Wouldn't it be great if you could start with this story and write a movie script? You are
going to write a movie, isn't that a good start?
<font color=#F9FF00FF>No, it doesn't hurt. </font>
<font color =#F9FF00FF>You make it hurt . </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>What do you want to gain by letting yourself get hurt? </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>what's the payoff of being hurt?</font>
<font color= #F9FF00FF>People to care . </font>
So you gotta give up pretending you don't want that .
Confront your own goddamn scenario ,
<font color=#F9FF00FF>your own goddamn soap opera. </font>
The victim mentality theory
This allows him to derive the third conclusion
Don't pretend to be a victim
Be 100% responsible for your commitment
This responsibility includes
Not being dominated by the need to go to the bathroom
When you overcome the urge to go to the bathroom
You take control of your life
<font color=#F9FF00FF>You have been seven whole hours without having peeing run your life. </font>
You have transcended peeing .
So even if there was a car accident on the road and caused you to be late
That's your choice too.
After the training
Students will feel a
The sense of self that I am the source of everything
Students begin to commit to taking responsibility for their own lives
This sounds positive and there's nothing wrong with it.
But this training actually has a deeper purpose
As long as the idea of ​​"I am the source of everything" is implanted in the students' minds
When you encounter problems in the future
Students will only review themselves
It's not that there's a problem with the course itself.
The absolute authority of the mentor will not be challenged
As long as you dare to challenge
Will be asked back
Why do you interpret it this way?
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Instructor: It’s not like 10 people asked you to sign up for the next stage</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Telling you to sign up</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>No, but someone called to ask if I had any questions</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Then another person called and asked</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>But when you have three or four calls coming in</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>It will be annoying</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>But you call this harassment? </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Yes, I call this harassment</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>But is this harassment? </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Of course</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>That's because you interpreted it this way</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>You can also have different interpretations</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>What? </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Those people called you to help and support you</font>
If the course makes you feel uncomfortable or harassed
That's just your interpretation.
Not objective reality
As long as you doubt that you have been deceived
You'll be accused of playing the victim.
He was a staff member
Also a student
Accused lecturer of multiple harassment
Report to the person in charge
He was asked to hand over his cell phone
Delete related conversation records
The three-stage course also deliberately designs growth time
So that students will not have the energy and time to question and criticize
At the end of the course
The mentor will suddenly become kind and gentle
Encourage you to help others
How can I help?
Erhard started a Hunger Project organization
Calling everyone to volunteer
Committed to ending world hunger by 1997
But people soon discovered
This charity is just a gimmick
Actually, I'm not doing anything
The real purpose behind this is to inspire people to help others.
The instructor will tell them
It feels good to help people, right?
If you want to help people around you
They should be invited to attend class.
That's what we hear now.
To save the starfish
Rescue them to shore
Because recruiting people is voluntary
No commission will be received
Therefore, the company does not need to worry about being accused of recruiting downline members through direct sales.
This will also prevent the things that were banned by the US government from happening again.
This is probably the first time in the history of capitalism that
Owner of a for-profit business
You can hire workers to work without paying them wages.
Workers will also voluntarily pay money to their bosses
But don't forget
Many people will come to this class.
They are all people who have broken off relations with their relatives and friends.
So another innovation of Erhard
That is to add a "repairing relationship" segment that was not originally included in the course.
Ask you to call your relatives and friends to care about them
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I want to talk to my mother on the phone</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Three minutes is enough, if she has time</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>The course will challenge you to have a conversation with your family of origin</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Then there will be homework</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Let you try to reconcile with your family</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>To find a better way to get along with your family</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>In fact, I think the first stage is relatively mild</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>At that time, I also called my relatives and friends</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>It means my change</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Then I said thank you for always being with me</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>They also think that</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Wow, how come I have changed so much</font>
This makes family and friends feel
Wow, you really have become more caring after taking this class.
Students will also be more defensive of the legitimacy of these courses
that's all
The three-stage course has been popular in the United States for 20 years.
Bringing huge business opportunities to many LGAT companies
It is estimated
As of 1994
At least 1.3 million Americans have taken the LGAT course.
But as the course becomes more and more famous
More and more people are criticizing the curriculum.
first
Erhard has no background in psychology.
He just read some books on popular psychology
Reusing early experience at Mind Dynamics
Just come out and teach by yourself
But many companies that promote three-stage courses
But they will lie that these courses are designed by psychologists
Has a scientific basis
<font color=#F9FF00FF>if you look at the latest neuroscience studies, </font>
it actually proves that the impact of language is inescapable on how we view our lives,
and how we interact with life .
Some concepts from psychology are also deliberately used in the course.
Like the iceberg theory
Inner Child
subconscious
Makes you mistakenly think that this course has a professional foundation in psychology
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Why are you yelling like that?
What made you yell out that remark ?
<font color=#F9FF00FF>．．．？</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>You just wanted to express yourself, yes? </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I do what I feel like. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>太棒了</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>That's marvelous. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I couldn't have put it better than this </font> <font color=#F9FF00FF>II couldn't have put it better myself.</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>" I do what I feel like . " </font>
People, this young man here is the inner child I've been talking about.
<font color=#F9FF00FF>供三小?</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>What?</font>
After the fact that there was no psychology major was exposed
These institutions will quickly hire several psychology professionals to act as guarantors
<font color=#F9FF00FF>After POP was sued</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I just listened to what they said</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>They quickly found a licensed psychologist to act as</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Just borrow the license</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Because it is safe this way</font>
etc.
If the three-stage course was not designed by psychologists
So how did Erhard come up with this?
This guy was actually a car salesman.
Original name is John Rosenberg
After something happened
I changed my name and moved to California to become a spiritual lecturer.
His sales experience led him to a conclusion
In reality
If he doesn't take the initiative to strive for performance
He can't make a dime.
So it all depends on me
This is why many business and insurance company owners
Will send employees to this kind of spiritual course
Give them the right mindset to pursue performance
To put it bluntly
The three-stage course is essentially a spiritual call for salesmen
And it is popular in the United States
This has attracted the attention of the psychology community
1981
American psychologist Janice Haaken and sociologist Richard Adams
Going Undercover to Infiltrate LifeSpring's Spirituality Courses
I want to see what these classes are about.
They published their participation in the Journal of Psychiatry
The title is "Self-growth has become a pathology"
People who have finished the course
I can feel more powerful.
Live in the present
Take responsibility for your own life
But this was achieved through morbid means.
The students played trust games, red and black games, ruins, and psychological dramas
The psychology behind this is this
In these games
The mentor will always berate and deny you
Make students feel helpless
This feeling of helplessness
It is actually reenacting the state of human infancy.
Children are unable to make rational judgments on their own
Must rely on adults
<font color=#F9FF00FF>He uses this mode of suppression</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Then tell us about ourselves</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>How bad are we</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>How about more</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>It is true that each of us has a bad side</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>But I don't think we should be treated like this</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>But what about now?</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I think it's the herd effect</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>He just made us doubt ourselves</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>When you doubt yourself</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Extreme pain of self-doubt</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>When there is no rescue</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Then our only one is</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Put this salvation on this course</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>to rely on him</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Go trust him</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Then, in his words, it is called opening yourself</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Empty yourself</font>
At this time, the mentor suddenly turns into a caring person.
In this way, the mentor will be recognized as a parent.
<font color=#F9FF00FF>What about the back?</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>He will be like a savior</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>He will start to talk to us</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Actually we are great</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>We have to accept ourselves</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Now</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I really think</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>It's really great to do this course</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>It was he who made me realize how bad I was</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>But I still deserve to be loved</font>
A few days later
The relationship between students and tutors
It will become like a child and an authoritative parent.
What I like most about these courses
This is a big family.
This is actually very clever psychological control
Because in the future, if there are any criticisms
It will trigger your psychological defense mechanism.
Feeling like others are criticizing your family
Why is this kind of psychological manipulation sick?
Because it is in the short term
Consuming one's inner self
Almost out of touch with reality.
I don't know what kind of harm it will cause to my body, mind and soul.
This is the scariest place
Just like the short-term self-excitement after taking drugs
You recommend it to your friends and family
But I don't know what side effects will occur.
In fact
The three-stage curriculum developed into the 1980s
Scandals have emerged one after another
Some people have mental breakdown
Someone sent to the doctor
Someone committed suicide
A total of 60 lawsuits have been filed
After the incident
Erhard closed EST (1985)
Started a new business and changed its name to Landmark Forum
After that, whenever there is a storm or controversy
These spiritual courses will change their names to avoid the limelight
Because it is difficult for students to prove that psychological damage was caused by the course
The most common phrase used by companies is
But it’s very effective for other students.
At that time, we couldn’t record videos with our mobile phones like we can now.
Difficult to find evidence
So in 1983
The U.S. federal court sent psychologist Margaret Singer of the University of California, Berkeley
Attend these courses in person
Investigate whether these courses cause harm
Margaret Singer completed six three-stage courses
After interviewing dozens of students, the conclusion is
LGAT courses involve ideological transformation
It's the modern corporate version of psychological manipulation technology.
Let people be manipulated without knowing it
This is why I oppose cults.
Unexpectedly, after Singer's book was published
Because this case was included
Landmark sued them for describing them as a cult
Later, Singer's computer was hacked.
At two in the morning, someone was standing at her door.
Someone put a dead mouse in my house
Finally, he even received death threats
Under this series of threats
The two sides finally reached a settlement
Singer issued a statement saying
Landmark's courses are not a cult
Another three-stage course company, LifeSpring, has also been embroiled in lawsuits
Finally forced to close
A student died on the spot due to an asthma attack in the classroom
The family was finally compensated with $450,000
Some students were permanently traumatized after taking the course.
The court awarded $800,000 in compensation
The most fatal blow to the three-stage course
It was a French television program in 2004.
France itself is a country with a deep psychoanalytic tradition.
This kind of spiritual course naturally attracted a lot of attention.
A French reporter brought a hidden camera to secretly film the class.
Revealed on TV
The parties were invited to share their experiences
Then the lawyer and psychologist will confront them face to face.
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I will simply say that after participating in the three-day course</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>My experience tells me this is a cult</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>This is a cult because this place treats you like a puppet</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>This is not much different from a cult</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>You always have a group, a pyramid structure</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>There are always various rhetoric to separate you from society</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>There is always this element of "making money from the victims"</font>
This TV station is amazing.
I even got the instructor's lecture notes for the three-stage course.
It turns out that every step of the lecturer
Every line
Each move
It's all pre-arranged scripts.
This shocked the students.
<font color=#F9FF00FF>For example on the first page</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>It says the opening remarks should not exceed two minutes</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>On the second page it says: You need to write the keywords on the whiteboard</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>On page 10 it says: You need to move your chair to the right</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>On page 22 it says: Move the chair to the left</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>The lecture notes even state: Questions that students may ask</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>This way you can better know what to say in reply</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Did you know that the entire course is pre-arranged? </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Ugh... I was totally shocked</font>
The TV station even broke the news
Landmark Agency spent 45,000 euros
Come and ask psychiatrists to help endorse that they are not a cult
But when the TV station questioned him face to face
The doctor denied it again.
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I didn't say this isn't a cult</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I didn't write yes or no, I didn't take any position</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>My criticism of the three-stage course technique is</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>It was not properly controlled</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Not supervised by psychologists</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>They also don't exchange information, and there is no introspection on these techniques</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>These people have not received training</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>But the next day he opened a shop like a psychological counselor</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>This is shocking</font>
The lawyer on the show also pointed out
Helping to recruit people to make money in a for-profit enterprise
But I don't have a labor contract and I get paid
This is actually a violation of French labor law.
After this episode aired
French TV station sued
Request to remove secretly filmed videos
So this episode has not been circulated on the Internet before.
Until 2019
Only then was it made public
Because the TV station's revelations were too damaging
Spiritual growth courses have disappeared in France
After being exposed many times in Europe and the United States
These courses have even become the butt of jokes among talk show hosts
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Everyone is hypnotized to remember past childhood traumas. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>And on the very last day, the leader rebuilds you with a landmark teaching.</font>
So you can see the world as they do .
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I had a friend of mine , who texted me out of nowhere.</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>She asked me if I had ever heard of Landmark's course</font> <font color=#F9FF00FF>and she's like, have you heard of this thing
called Landmark at all ? </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Oh no...</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Oh my god</font>
And I go, Yeah, it's a cult .
<font color=#F9FF00FF>And she's like, you 're
so funny.</font>
Anyway , I wanted to give you this great opportunity
.
<font color=#F9FF00FF>And she just kept texting me. </font>
But do you think this is the end?
After being exposed in European and American countries
Spiritual growth courses
Will be reborn in the next place
The three-stage curriculum has been the subject of controversy and lawsuits since the 1980s.
But the Internet was not well developed at that time.
Information is not circulated
People in Asian countries don’t actually know about these scandals happening in Europe and America
So the instructor at that time thought
Why not take advantage of this information gap?
Opening up new markets in Asia
Asians don't know what the three stages are yet
Erhard left the United States and brought the "Spiritual Growth Course" to Japan
So I want to push against me.
<font color=#F9FF00FF>And you see that you're trapped. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Do you see that I am controlling you?
You see that I own you ?
You see that you've got no freedom .
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I got your whole life locked in. </font>
Yeah,
That's your husband.
<font color=#F9FF00FF>He owns your life.
</font>
Japan was in the midst of a bubble economy in the 1990s.
The lost decade of Japan
Many people seek help from spiritual self-help, religious groups
Aum Shinrikyo
It was during this period that it rose
1995
Aum Shinrikyo announces terrorist attack on Tokyo subway
Causing panic among Japanese society
It was broadcast in the same year
The final chapter of Neon Genesis Evangelion
At that time, the author had funding issues.
Forced to end the TV version early
Although he has not participated in any spiritual growth courses
But there is a huge demand for spiritual courses in Japan
But it inspired him to write the final chapter
<font color=#F9FF00FF>You think reality is bad so you feel disgusted</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>It is your heart that has reversed reality and truth</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Just look at the reality from a slightly different angle</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>There will be a big change in your heart</font>
Human Instrumentality Project
Just like a teenager
Experience of taking the three-stage course
The protagonist's personality is first destroyed and then reborn
Finally all relatives and friends
Come to his graduation ceremony
Applaud him
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Congratulations</font>
But as the three-stage becomes more and more popular in Japan
Scandals are growing
In 1997, a journalist named Tomomi Shiotani, who had attended the class, wrote a book exposing
Saying that the three-stage course is a form of mental rape
Japanese psychologist Kazuhiko Nakamura carefully studied these three-stage courses
Count the people who attended the course
8% experienced severe psychological harm
An Osaka man took part in the three-stage course of Japan's ASK company
Fainted on the third day
Died after being sent to hospital
There are also new employees in pharmaceutical companies who are required by the company to participate in "awareness and behavior reform training"
After the course ended, he was overwhelmed and committed suicide
The same thing is not only happening in Japan
After Erhard arrived in Japan in 1991
His students went out to spread out
Establishing bases in various Asian countries
His student Chris Gentry founded AsiaWorks
Focus on Southeast Asian market
Another student, Robert White, went to Hong Kong to found Life Dynamics
In less than four years, more than 7,000 students have been enrolled.
Many of these students are Chinese and Taiwanese.
After completing the training
The three-stage course was also spread to China and Taiwan.
In 1995, the course even included walking on fire.
Train students to overcome their inner fears
<font color=#F9FF00FF>It will have a very long fire</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>And all of it is burnt with charcoal</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Then let you run over</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>There are still many people who were burned</font>
In 2000
Hong Kong Polytechnic University even offers the "Qingyun Road Training Scholarship"
90% subsidy provided by the school
Let students take spiritual courses
After completing the course
Credits for extracurricular activities
But why does the school allocate funds for students to take spiritual courses?
2005 Next Magazine revealed
It turns out that the Vice President of the Polytechnic University
He is also the director of a spiritual training company.
Use the school's money to subsidize students to take spiritual courses
The money finally went back into my pocket.
In the past 20 years
Scandals have erupted in Asia's three-stage courses
Asking female students to run naked, suspected of sexual harassment
A few years ago, a general manager of a Chinese company fainted during a spiritual course.
Died after being sent to hospital
In Taiwan
As early as 2005
Xindongli Company was fined by the Ministry of Education for illegally recruiting students.
When did these spiritual growth courses enter Taiwan?
This corresponds to the period when psychology was gradually flourishing.
People began to have some basic understanding of psychology
Want to learn more about self-growth
In order to increase the credibility of these institutions
I like to find influencers and public figures to join the promotion courses
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I want to thank ASK again</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Because I have a very good attitude to communicate</font>
It is worth noting that
The word "heart" was not included in the English name of the LGAT course.
Personal Growth
But the people who brought this course to Asia
I deliberately chose the words "spiritual growth"
Maybe it was because of the Asian financial crisis.
Many people need some spiritual sustenance
Bring the three-stage course to Asia with the original team
There is an important behind-the-scenes promoter named Robert Chaen
He, Robert White and Chris Gentry brought the three-stage course to Asia
Why is he important?
Because in 2017
He decided to expose the truth about these courses on the Internet
Now let's listen to it.
True confession from the instructor who brought the three-stage course to Asia
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Being one of the
first Asian pioneer promoters to promote ＬＧＡＴ ,
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I feel I have the full authority to critique this cult category. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>They appear to give you love and respect and a way of belonging to a group, </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>but actually you have to pay a heavy price.</font> <font color=#F9FF00FF>but actually you have to pay a heavy price.</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Why does it last so long from 10pm to 10pm, or even until midnight? </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>So why the long hours you say is like 10 to 10 or even to midnight?</font>
Because it's a very psychological warfare they do .
<font color=#F9FF00FF>They're trying to put Humpty Dumpty on the wall, push them to the wall, </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>stress them , pressure them.</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>But trouble is Humpty Dumpty may fall and break his head. </font>
So I've seen many people emotionally bruised that they need a lot of counselling.
I myself counsel many people from this type of groups .
<font color=#F9FF00FF>So the long hours to wear down the participants </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>so that they won't resist anymore and they will just listen .</font>
Let me tell you the most dark side of large group awareness training .
<font color=#F9FF00FF>It's actually the hardcore selling. </font>
Like I said, there are some beneficial concepts they teach .
that's
no doubt .
<font color=#F9FF00FF>But ,
the big but is this.</font>
Coaches have a very deceptive way of camouflaging the hardcore selling
and they actually present it as a twisted concept called enrolling skills.
And then they slip in this thing
that they go around the room asking for enrolment figure.
<font color=#F9FF00FF>They'll go one by one.</font> <font color=#F9FF00FF>They'll go one by one.</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>No one escapes this. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>They'll go, you? How many? </font>
There will be a small team leader that will be marking all the figures
<font color=#F9FF00FF>and they will hold you to it. </font>
This is where the group pressure is .
And if you're behind the publicly declared figure ,
<font color=#F9FF00FF>they will pressure you to achieve it. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF> And in the final, say,
in the 90 days, you do not achieve it.</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Anything that's less than 100 is a failure in their eyes. </font>
And they'll make sure you feel that.
So
these LGAT coaches are a disgrace to our training profession
Because this is not how trainers are .
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I really against this despicable act. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>This despicable practice of LGBT hard sell enrolments. </font>
You don't have to tell people how much you've changed and broadcast your belief.
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Your life should be a testimonial of how transformed your life is. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>And people will go like, I want to know what she's eating.</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I want to know what he has, that I want to join.</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Your life should be such an attraction to attract people to join this.</font>
Okay, let's put the whole thing in context.
The LGAT course originated in the 1960s
A group of people who run a pyramid scheme to attract more people
Designed by a sadistic psychopath
After being banned by the US government
A group of businessmen improved it into a less illegal version
Making a fortune by taking advantage of the American hippie movement and young people's desire for spiritual salvation
Since the 1980s
American Psychology Community Involved in Survey
Think these courses are pathological
Some characteristics of a cult
After it was revealed that some students had become mentally ill or even committed suicide
These companies take advantage of information gaps
Turning to the Asian market
Finally, the things we heard about in Taiwan today happened.
Looking back over the past half century
We will discover the history of spiritual growth courses
In fact, students keep getting into trouble.
The company keeps changing its name
A history of constant wars with other countries
So why are so many people being victimized?
Who would join this course?
The United States once conducted a national survey on this issue
50% of the respondents said
I will attend spiritual courses
Because of the great changes and difficulties in life
Many people are at the bottom of their lives.
When you go there and hear other people share their broken families
Tragic life story
You'll feel less miserable.
This in itself will have a healing effect
in other words
Spirituality courses provide a placebo effect
Let these people warm each other up
Grab something you can believe in
Even if this belief is based on exploitation
<font color=#F9FF00FF>some people that never seem to find an anchor in life. </font>
You know , those they kind of drift from one way of thinking to another
.
<font color=#F9FF00FF>think a lot of the
ways these organizations work</font>
and it's not necessarily all bad,
<font color=#F9FF00FF>is that they provide lonely people a sense of community. </font>
This may also be why
These people would rather attend spiritual courses
I am not willing to see a psychologist.
Because these courses can provide the companionship of the group in the short term
So just criticizing these courses doesn't get to the root of the problem.
That is, how society provides people with a sense of belonging to a group.
To meet the psychological needs of those whose lives have undergone tremendous changes
If these needs are met
Then these spiritual courses will naturally not be able to affect these people.
Another problem is
A psychologist will not give you a definite answer.
You may need more than a dozen sessions before you see any results.
But some people just want some authority to give them a quick answer
Tell him how to improve his life
These spiritual courses will promise
After taking the course, your life will grow
It seems like they have some secret cure.
So we should ask the other way around.
Why do some people think that taking a one-week course
You can solve a difficult problem in your life.
Why do some people believe
As long as I obey an authority, I can guide the direction of my life
Is it because of the family education and school education in Taiwan since childhood?
Deep down, this kind of obedience to authority is also encouraged.
In fact
Psychologist Robert Lifton found that
Thought Reform Techniques Used in Spiritual Courses
Not entirely an American invention
It actually has an oriental origin
It can be traced back to the Korean War.
Many American prisoners of war captured by the Chinese Communist Party
Being ideologically remodeled
First, abuse them
Then suddenly turned into love
Many brainwashing techniques are the same as those in the later spiritual courses.
Brainwashing
In fact, it was an American journalist in the 1950s.
invented when translating what happened during the Korean War into English
The word originates from the Chinese word brainwash.
So the three-stage course that Taiwanese people are taking now
In essence, it is the same brainwashing technique as the ideological transformation in China.
Finally, let us end this episode with a short story.
1989
A 27-year-old young man participated in Landmark's three-stage course.
After class
He realized he was in a big trap.
After he read the book by psychologist Singer
I found out that the three-stage course he had taken was so weird.
The young man decided to write his story into a novel
Made into a movie
The young man's name is Chuck Palahniuk
The name of this movie is "Fight Club"
Fighting Club was an accident and added a three-stage course
The final escape story
First to enter the course
Confidentiality rules must be followed
The first rule of fight Club is
<font color=#F9FF00FF>you do not talk about fight club. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Second rule of fight
Club is you do not talk about fight club.</font>
There will be an authoritative instructor in the course
Tell you to be 100% responsible for yourself
Can't find a reason
It will also teach you the importance of keeping your promises.
<font color=#F9FF00FF>You broke your promise. </font>
You're fucking talking to her about me .
<font color=#F9FF00FF>What is going on? What
the fuck is going on here?
I asked you for one thing
,
Will deliberately humiliate you to break your original personality
<font color=#F9FF00FF>You're too old
, fat man.</font>
The course will teach you to break through fear
Ask you to overcome your fear and do something dangerous
Without pain, without sacrifice, you would have nothing .
People who have overcome their fears
To move to the next stage
After the mentor destroys you
He will suddenly become a warm and loving father
Give you a motivational speech
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Our great war is a spiritual war. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Our Great Depression is our lives. </font>
You will also learn the philosophy of the three-stage program
You are the source of everything
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I am Jack's smirking revenge. </font>
If there is any trauma in life
You caused that.
Over time
Daily work and life
It no longer makes sense to you
Only spiritual courses are the source of your sense of belonging
Many students will volunteer to serve as free volunteers
Once you are fully immersed in this course
The instructor will start giving assignments
I want you to go outside and get someone
<font color=#F9FF00FF>This week ,
each one of you has a homework assignment.</font>
<font color= #F9FF00FF>You're going to go out. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>You 're
going to start a fight with a total stranger.</font>
The course scale is getting bigger and bigger
We have branches all over the country
The students will not realize
They subconsciously
I have fully recognized the mentor
Little by little
,
You just letting yourself become ...
Tyler Durden.
Until one day you find out
The course began to have disastrous consequences
When you want to quit
The teacher will tell you not to escape
<font color=#F9FF00FF>But this is too much. I don't want this. </font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Take some responsibility. </font>
These plots
Look familiar?
But in the end
Fight Club depicts the possibility of liberation
There will still be sober people around you
Can help you see the truth
<font color=#F9FF00FF>You have very serious emotional problems , deep seated problems</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF> for which
you should seek professional help.</font>
Until one day you no longer rely on that short-lived, imaginary community of love
You will see
What a huge price you paid for all this.
