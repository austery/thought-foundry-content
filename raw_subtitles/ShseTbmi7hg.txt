[Speaker 0]:  this is shell die，
[Speaker 0]:  and i'm back。
[Speaker 0]:  welcome to reference letter issue five hundred，
[Speaker 0]:  sixty three，
[Speaker 0]:  a story about a twenty six year old britain who travelled thousands of miles to china to treat a skin condition，
[Speaker 0]:  has gone viral on social media。
[Speaker 0]:  today，
[Speaker 0]:  he would have had to wait several months for treatment locally，
[Speaker 0]:  but in china，
[Speaker 0]:  the problem was solved in just thirteen days for approximately three hundred pounds。
[Speaker 0]:  similar videos and posts are frequently appearing，
[Speaker 0]:  making the influx of foreigners coming to china for medical treatment of hot topic。
[Speaker 0]:  shinwa news agency quoted the director of the international medical department of peking union medical college hospital，
[Speaker 0]:  is saying they compared to previous years。
[Speaker 0]:  number of foreign patients in the hospitals international department has increased，
[Speaker 0]:  especially since twenty twenty twenty four。
[Speaker 0]:  the head of the international medical center at southern medical university also revealed that although the overall number of foreign patients at the hospital is relatively small is growing rapidly，
[Speaker 0]:  mainly from russia，
[Speaker 0]:  singapore，
[Speaker 0]:  the united states，
[Speaker 0]:  indonesia，
[Speaker 0]:  malaysia and south africa。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  a survey by eki global found that most international gloents seeking medical treatment in china are those already working in china。
[Speaker 0]:  and the number of international patients specifically coming to china for medical treatment remains very small egui global quoted the chairman of across border medical tourism agency，
[Speaker 0]:  shame newo，
[Speaker 0]:  a saying that the idea of a larger number of foreigers flogking to china for medical treatment created by social media might be misunderstanding。
[Speaker 0]:  he believes there's a growing trend，
[Speaker 0]:  but the actual scale is still very small estimaing that the number of foreign client specifically coming to china for medical treatment in twenty twenty five，
[Speaker 0]:  maybe less than ten thousand。
[Speaker 0]:  the twenty twenty four china international medical services industry development report shows that eight hundred fifty medical institutions in fifty seven cities in mainland china provide international medical services industry insiders beliethat china's medical services have unique advantages in some areas，
[Speaker 0]:  attracting international al treatments to seek medical treatment in china。
[Speaker 0]:  a fuu za ran from the national health commissions medical administration。
[Speaker 0]:  reppartment point out that china has richard clinical experience in some specialized fids ds and vvaned treatment technologies，
[Speaker 0]:  such as port on therapy and salth therapy are also cheaper than developed countries。
[Speaker 0]:  furthermore，
[Speaker 0]:  with the increasing international regnition of traditional chinese medicine，
[Speaker 0]:  accupunture ture massage and some characteristic chinese medicines welcomed by foreign patients who often take advantage chchine's vissaffree entry policices to to jor TCM treatment，
[Speaker 0]:  while traveling。
[Speaker 0]:  china is a major exporter of rorosporder medical services with a hundred thousand people travelling abroad each year seeking medical services，
[Speaker 0]:  chking it a major source country for global medical consumption。
[Speaker 0]:  in contrast，
[Speaker 0]:  this can a medical tourism in china is relatively small compared to other countries。
[Speaker 0]:  the international medical tourism market has two main directions。
[Speaker 0]:  one is high value individuals from developing countries seeking higher medical standards in develop countries。
[Speaker 0]:  the other is middle in low income individuals from the veloped countries，
[Speaker 0]:  seeking lower price medical services in asian countries。
[Speaker 0]:  industry insider suggest that china can focus on the second type of market will the increasing number of foreigers seeking medical treatment in china occupy domestic medical resources。
[Speaker 0]:  a reporter from yi KII，
[Speaker 0]:  china news leararned，
[Speaker 0]:  the e ddle le reimbursement annotaations foreigntend to treatment，
[Speaker 0]:  ment the interdical trepartment domestic spitals and will not occupy basic medical service resources。
[Speaker 0]:  since last year，
[Speaker 0]:  the international departments of several public hospitals have been put into operation，
[Speaker 0]:  becoming an innovation in deepening the reform of public hospitals，
[Speaker 0]:  and meeting the multii level and diversified medical funds。
[Speaker 0]:  the shyygg，
[Speaker 0]:  who non two indian in african masters were recognize this foreign experts by the science ununchnology bureu，
[Speaker 0]:  each receiving a one thousand u unconsolation fee in response to public questions。
[Speaker 0]:  the shuyang municipal science and technology bureauresponded that while they did distribute the relevant funds，
[Speaker 0]:  the foreign experts certification in the source of the funds from from the shyyang municipal science and technology bureu，
[Speaker 0]:  they were merely the handling and a shyyg science。
[Speaker 0]:  and technology bureauhas not yet announce specific policy。
[Speaker 0]:  this incident may be related to huononce policy of optimizing innovvation and entrepreneururship environment，
[Speaker 0]:  fofoigners and attracting overseas talents and intelligence last year，
[Speaker 0]:  who not launched eight measures to improve the innovation and entrepreneurr ship environment for foreigners，
[Speaker 0]:  attracting more foreigers to developin the province and introducing various speciitation measures，
[Speaker 0]:  as can be seen from the table in the habile news dodeo。
[Speaker 0]:  the two indian and african masters were classified as classie talents according the minminstry of science and technology documents。
[Speaker 0]:  classy talents are foreign professional talents who meet the requirements of the cdologership guidance for worners working in china and job requirements and are needed for china's conomomic social development。
[Speaker 0]:  shi yung is currently striving to become a world class food capital，
[Speaker 0]:  which may be one of the reasons for the preferential policy given to the indian and african masters。
[Speaker 0]:  furthermore，
[Speaker 0]:  the one thousand new on is not a research grant，
[Speaker 0]:  but rather a special fund for comforting univergn experts during major festival，
[Speaker 0]:  such as the spring festival，
[Speaker 0]:  which inevitably reminds people of the shanddon university scholarship incident。
[Speaker 0]: 这没有意见，
[Speaker 0]:  perhaps for the administrators。
[Speaker 0]:  it doesn't matter who receives the money，
[Speaker 0]:  as long as the procedures are compliant。
[Speaker 0]:  this comes at a time when hinnwas planning toward five hundred thousand new on in one million ununrespepectively jjacy chchungand eaon chain for their concerts，
[Speaker 0]:  which parks strong controversy。
[Speaker 0]:  supporters argue that concerts can attract a large number of tourists from other regions，
[Speaker 0]:  boosting local transportation，
[Speaker 0]:  accommodation and kating industries。
[Speaker 0]:  they see the subsidies as a leverage investment and the beneficaries of the concert organizers，
[Speaker 0]:  not the individual singers。
[Speaker 0]:  the opposing voices are equally sharp with medzines questioning，
[Speaker 0]:  whether public unds should should be prioritize for public warfare areas，
[Speaker 0]:  and whether the investment of public funds in commercial concerts has undergone sufficient research in deliberation。
[Speaker 0]:  in recent years，
[Speaker 0]:  concerts have become an important driving force for promoting cultural consumption upgrades in various regions。
[Speaker 0]:  many provinces have introducsupport ort icies with deverver subsidy forms，
[Speaker 0]:  including direct financial rewards to concert organizers as well as subsidies for venue rental and promotional activities。
[Speaker 0]:  some regions even said tear reward standards based on factors such as performance，
[Speaker 0]:  scale，
[Speaker 0]:  box office revenue and the proportion of audiences from other regions。
[Speaker 0]:  a commentary from john sue jdidian new susuggest。
[Speaker 0]:  the core issue may be public concerned about the fairness in necessity of using public funds，
[Speaker 0]:  the feeling that public funds are being spent without sufficient scrutiny，
[Speaker 0]:  while concert organizers are rephuge ge profits and giving rewards to already wealthy organizers creates a sense of unfairness，
[Speaker 0]:  especially when there is still room for improvement in areas such as education，
[Speaker 0]:  health care and elder care。
[Speaker 0]:  and when some groups are still facing significant financial pressure，
[Speaker 0]:  investing millions of public funds in commercial concerts inevitably leads to public perception of resource mesilcayesterally。
[Speaker 0]:  after much anticipated，
[Speaker 0]:  the formulation of national standards for pre package meals has been accelerated yesterday，
[Speaker 0]:  the state councilfood safety office issued notice soliciting opinions on national standards for prepackage meals，
[Speaker 0]:  terminology and classification of prepackage meals，
[Speaker 0]:  and the promotion of self management in the cering ininstry ry can be seen as a positive impact of luu o young house battle against she bay。
[Speaker 0]:  the ambiguity of the concept of prepackage meals has led to continuous controversy in twenty twenty four six departments，
[Speaker 0]:  including the state administration from market regulation provided definition，
[Speaker 0]:  but the scope the definition is relatively complex，
[Speaker 2]:  requiring no presservatives to be added。
[Speaker 0]:  does this mean that semi finished dishes containing preseratives are not considered prepackage meals。
[Speaker 0]:  this differs significantly from consumers，
[Speaker 0]:  general understanding many businesses，
[Speaker 0]:  including shibay，
[Speaker 0]:  insists that some i finished or finished dishes are not prepackage meals，
[Speaker 0]:  which also challenges public perception。
[Speaker 0]:  this national standard for preprepared dishes is similar to the last one in terms of its definition。
[Speaker 0]:  preprepared dishes are defined as prepackage dishes made from one or more edible agricultural and their derivatives raw materials，
[Speaker 0]:  whether may out seasonings and oxililiary materials without adding preseratives and process through industrial preprocessing。
[Speaker 0]:  they may or may not include seasoning packets and already deeve after heating or cooking。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  the scope of exclusion has been exexpanded to not only stable foods，
[Speaker 0]:  but also ready to eat foods and dishes prepared in central kitchens。
[Speaker 0]:  these categories are no longer considered preprepared dishes，
[Speaker 0]:  thus narrowing the grey area regarding public concerns about safety and nutrition。
[Speaker 0]:  the standard stipulates said，
[Speaker 0]:  on the one hand，
[Speaker 0]:  the use of preservatives ves prohibited and the use of other food additives is strictly limited，
[Speaker 0]:  emphazzthat additives ves should be be in less necesstive。
[Speaker 0]:  on the other hand，
[Speaker 0]:  the maximum shelf life for preprepared dishes is set at twelve months。
[Speaker 0]:  addressing public concerns about hioil high salsalt and lagununutrition。
[Speaker 0]:  the standard encourages the adoption of advance ccecesing sing technologies，
[Speaker 0]:  rereduce nutritrilaw control the amount of oil，
[Speaker 0]:  salt and sugar，
[Speaker 0]:  added and integrate the concepts of reduce oil，
[Speaker 0]:  salt and sugar production standards，
[Speaker 0]:  promoting the industries transformation towards healthier direction。
[Speaker 0]:  it encourages the use of preservation technologies such as modified atmosphere，
[Speaker 0]:  packaging and ice temperature preservation，
[Speaker 0]:  as well as thermal processing and packaging technologies that stabilized nutrience and flavor，
[Speaker 0]:  reducing nutrient bloss and improving taste texture and overall quality。
[Speaker 0]: 被告的意据 dud to safeart consumers right to information，
[Speaker 0]:  preprepared dishes must be clearly label with instructions on whether they require heating or cooking before consumption，
[Speaker 0]:  ensuring consumers are fully informed in the catering sector，
[Speaker 0]:  a policy of encouraging civil compliance rather than mandatory standards has been adopted，
[Speaker 0]:  respecting consumers right to information and choice，
[Speaker 0]:  while also considering the current situation of the catering industry and international practices。
[Speaker 0]:  in short，
[Speaker 0]:  preprepared food is an enineititable product of industrial development，
[Speaker 0]:  fitting the current fast pace lifestyle。
[Speaker 0]:  the development trend is irreversible，
[Speaker 0]:  but the industry must strike go balance between development and public safety，
