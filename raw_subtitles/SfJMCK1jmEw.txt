>> During his speech at this
year's conservative convention,
Pierre Poilievre hit on a very
familiar theme crime.
>> After ten years of liberal
rule, Canada is more costly and
crime ridden, dangerous and
dependent and divided than ever
before.
>> The liberals, for their part,
are proposing stricter policies
around crime, things like making
bail harder to get and allowing
for consecutive sentences.
So yeah, both parties are
leaning into a tough on crime
message, and that's not coming
out of nowhere.
Recent polling from the Angus
Reid Institute shows 3 in 5
Canadians believe crime has gone
up where they live over the past
five years.
But what do the numbers actually
say?
Have a look at some data from
Statscan.
You can see that police reported
crime has been rising since
around 2014, but the way that
the top line comes down sure
makes it look like we're in a
better place now than we were in
1998.
Is there something we're missing
here, or are perceptions out of
step with reality?
And if they are, why?
We're going to dig into the data
on crime and into what Canadians
believe about crime, and look at
the relationship between fears
and facts.
This is The Rundown.
The majority of Canadians
believe that crime in their
community has increased over the
past five years.
That's according to recent
polling from the Angus Reid
Institute.
But do those fears line up with
what's actually happening?
I asked Shachi Kurl, president
of the Angus Reid Institute.
Your institute found that 62% of
Canadians, that's about 3 in 5
people, believe that over the
past five years, crime has been
rising in their communities.
So help us understand why
Canadians are feeling this way.
>> I think the the really the
first thing to do is look at the
what and then let's chat about
the why that nearly two thirds
of Canadians who say, I feel
like crime is rising in my
community represents a double
the number who felt that way a
dozen years ago.
So this is a question we've been
asking and tracking for a really
long time.
But what is quite stark is back
in 2014.
So just about 12 years ago, the
number of people who felt that
way was only 30%.
It's now 62%.
So you you have a there's a
couple of things going on.
Right.
But this is a perceptive
question.
Jeyan.
So do you feel less safe in your
community?
And you've got two thirds
saying, yes, I do feel less safe
now.
We've got to unpack some of the
why like you mentioned.
Well, some of this does have to
do in a lot of communities with
real perceptions of call it more
disorder on the street, whether
it's unhoused communities,
whether it's the opioid crisis,
whether it's a mental health,
whether it's the combination of
that plus the mental health
crisis.
I get the sense that Canadians
are telling us that they're
seeing more visible results of
of people just not doing so well
in front of them, on the
streets, in their communities.
And that speaks to a sense of a
lack of safety.
The the interesting part of
this, though, is when we look at
violent crime in communities
across the country, some of that
is, is you see more in terms of
property crime, but in terms of
violent crime, stabbings,
murder, that kind of thing.
Those numbers are actually have
been, over time declining.
>> I think if we see here in
Toronto, the homicide rates have
nearly halved from the year
before.
So so on that note, help us
understand demographics a little
bit.
What what demographics groups
are more afraid of crime right
now?
>> I think that one of the
biggest drivers, in terms of
who's identifying crime and and
lack of safety in their
communities, either is something
as they're perceiving or is a
top issue for them.
There is such a political
driving line along this.
So, you know, two things can be
true at the same time.
Number one, we're seeing more
people across the political
spectrum, regardless of how they
vote, saying they feel less
safe.
And you also see this borne out
in the data when we ask
Canadians, you know, what is the
top issue for you?
Again, ten, 12 years ago, the
number of people saying crime
and public safety issues, maybe
4%, 5%.
Today that number is at 20%.
And you know what?
Liberal voters are identifying
it.
More NDP voters are identifying
it more in Quebec, more black
voters.
But the big driver here is the
fact that conservative voters
federally are most likely to to
be driving this, in part because
maybe it's something that they
are feeling more, but also
because their leader, Pierre
Poilievre, is talking about it a
lot more.
And Jeyan, I would also say that
ideologically, what's really
interesting about crime and
public safety issues, maybe
unlike economic issues or social
issues or identity politics
issues, crime and public safety
tends to be a little bit less
ideologically sensitive.
So you can be someone who leans
left on a lot of issues, but
still maybe doesn't feel that
safe when you leave your house
at night, walking alone in your
neighbourhood or your community,
which is another measure metric
we've been tracking over time
and are also noticing more
people saying they don't really
feel that safe in their
neighbourhood after dark.
That's a big change.
>> Well, I want to talk about
that just in the results in
itself.
But also the question this is a
question that I remember in high
school, one of my teachers
talking to us about, you know,
when you are walking home by
yourself at night, what to
prepare for.
It's kind of this, this idea
that we have to be on edge.
I'm just curious, not just the
results on itself, but why that
question?
Why is that a question that we
that we're asking when we talk
about sort of crime and feeling
safe.
>> Again, it's an important way
to measure.
Now you're I think if I'm
interpreting what you're saying
correctly there, you're sort of
challenging the notion of why
put that seed in people's heads
or why ask that question?
So they're thinking about it
that way.
The thing is, you know, we ask
all kinds of questions about all
kinds of things.
Maybe they're thinking about it,
maybe they're not.
And it's not the first question
we ask in a survey so that, you
know, we're prompting them to go
right there.
There are lots of questions you
ask about, you know, you know,
how you feel living in your
neighbourhood.
You know, what your own sense of
overall, you know, security is.
Are you someone who takes more
precautions or are you somebody
who takes more risks?
You asked about demography.
It's also a key question that
goes back, you know, 50, 60, 70
years, particularly in terms of
trying to understand how maybe
people who are older.
There's also sometimes a gender
divide on this issue, men
walking alone at night versus
women walking alone at night.
So this is a very tried and true
question that's been asked, you
know, in in many jurisdictions
in the US and Canada and Europe
for many decades.
And it is one part of of several
questions that are asked to, to
sort of gauge people's
experiences with their own
personal safety, with property
safety or security, and also
financial safety and security.
>> One of the other focuses from
your data was looking at
shoplifting and retail workers.
This is over the last, you know,
over the past year, Canadians
have seen plenty of videos.
And these might be isolated.
But help us understand, you
know, what did the report find?
>> Well, we did a special
question to people working in
retail.
Are you noticing more
shoplifting or attempts at
shoplifting?
Is this something that that
you're having to interact with?
It absolutely is more than than
in the past.
And certainly that tracks with
what we hear about a rising cost
of living, higher food prices,
price inflation on all sorts of
things, and the kinds of
measures that you see when you
walk into the drug store.
Now, you know, the, the, the,
the razor blade, not the razor
blades, but you know, the, the
shaving razors are behind
plastic or Plexiglas, all kinds
of things that you used to just
be able to take off of a shelf
are behind Plexiglas now.
And and that is in part because
people who work in retail are
noticing more loss or attempt at
loss.
And, and companies these, these
retail chains are are saying to
to retail workers, look, your
safety is not worth the risk of
of theft.
So you know other there are
other ways and other measures to
deal with this.
But it's something that retail
workers themselves are
identifying.
And, you know, Jeyan, there's
there's another area of theft
that really seems to be
affecting so many more
Canadians, and that's attempts
or actual theft or successful
theft in, in the cyber crime
area or in attempted fraud.
And you know, who among us now
has not noticed either an
attempt at somebody trying to
send a fishy link or try and get
your money that way, whether
it's via a third party platform
like PayPal fraud.
And I'm not just calling out
PayPal, all kinds of frauds
related to that, or directly as
a result of fishy charges on on
your visa card or through your
bank statement going, hey, I
didn't pay for that.
Having to get on the phone to
the bank or to your credit card
company and and unpack that.
4 in 5 Canadians, 80% say that
this is something that they are
noticing and and to tie it back
into perceptions of crime in
your neighbourhood, you know,
40, 50 years ago, the equivalent
to that even 30 years ago was
someone trying to mug you, you
know, confronting you on the
street and demanding your
wallet.
The thieves now are not trying
to do this to you face to face.
They're trying to do it by
getting you to to click
mindlessly on something when
you're not paying attention, to
get access to your information
and try to defraud you.
And that now seems to be modern
day mugging.
>> In our last 30 seconds,
I do have to ask, when we talk
about perception, Canadians
often compare themselves to the
US.
So I am curious if we're looking
at the data, does it tell us
whether we're more fearful of
crime than our neighbours to the
south?
>> It's such an interesting
question, Jan, and it's one that
really did make me shake my
head.
In fact, we asked Americans
where where they are on this
issue, and Canadian Canadians
are actually more heightened to
perceptions of of lack of safety
in increasing crime in their
communities relative to the US,
where we actually see Americans
less likely to say that, yes,
they think that crime is
increasing over the last few
years and their communities.
And I don't know whether that's
Americans becoming inured to to
crime and violence in their
communities or whether when your
baseline is maybe gun violence
on the streets, if you're if
you're experiencing less of it
as as maybe people are in the
United States, in certain
communities, we look to what's
happening south of the border.
And and as Canadians, we would
have a different perception of
that.
But Americans themselves are
more likely to say, yeah, crime
is not increasing in my
communities compared to
Canadians.
That that was a bit surprising
to me.
>> And unfortunately, that's
where we're going to have to
leave it.
Thank you so much.
Really appreciate your time on
this.
>> My pleasure.
Take care.
Jan.
>> You might expect that when
crime rates fall, fear levels
follow, but that doesn't always
seem to be the case.
So let's take a look at risk
perception.
And when being afraid makes
sense and when it might not, I
was joined by Steve Joordens, a
psychology professor at the
University of Toronto
Scarborough, and Jennifer
Magnus, a former police officer
and an assistant professor of
policing and public safety at
Wilfrid Laurier University.
Steve, I'm going to start with
you.
We just heard from pollster
Shachi Kurl on Canadians fear
growing fear of crime.
And I'm wondering, from a
psychologist point of view,
whether it makes sense for
Canadians to be afraid of crime.
>> Yeah, I think what we're
seeing also is a very much an
internalisation of all the
threat we're all feeling from
all sides now, right?
We've got the environmental
stuff, we've got geopolitical
stuff.
Our our brain just sort of
reacts to threat.
In fact, it's it's got special
systems just to look for threat
and to get us ready for it.
And those systems are kind of
engaged like never before now.
And we have this sort of chronic
stress.
And when that happens, you know,
things like crime which would
always be perceived as as
threatening but probably are
perceived as more threatening,
more likely to happen than they
than they typically would.
So I think the environment is
really contributing to this
perception we're having.
>> Jennifer, as we learned in
our last segment, the stats show
crime has come down a bit in the
last year.
So why doesn't that seem to
resonate with people?
>> I think because it's
in our faces all the time in
social media.
Back in the day, we only saw
news when it happened on the
hour, usually in the evening
news, and now we see it at our
fingertips whenever we want, so
people feel like it's always
there and they see it happening,
and they almost resonate with
the individuals who are also
experiencing it, which then
causes that increased feel of
fear in their lives.
>> Yeah.
And if I may just add to that
quickly to the design of social
media is to grab eyeballs.
And we are attracted to things
that are scary.
And so it's not just that we're
all getting our news from social
media.
There's a bias in social media
to present this scary stuff to
us.
>> Jennifer, I do want to ask,
you know, in terms of the types
of crimes that we're seeing, and
I'm hoping you can maybe go back
to, you know, your time on the
front lines as well.
But the types of crimes that
we're seeing and that we're
seeing on social media that
we're seeing, you know, on our
6:00 news, it feels like it's
more personal that, you know,
these are much closer to home
when we see home invasions, when
we're seeing, you know,
carjackings does does any of
that resonate as well?
>> I would say yes.
>> And the fear of being broken
into is greater for people,
especially when it's happening.
What, like in rural Alberta, it
is actually on the increase
property crime.
And when an individual
experiences property crime, they
feel violated and then they feel
fearful in their own home when
they're supposed to feel safe.
And I know as a police officer,
we encountered a lot of drug
crime, mental health.
And my colleague and I are
actually doing a study on police
officers experiences with the
increased drug crimes and
homelessness, and they're
finding that police officers are
experiencing that at a greater
rate, and people are becoming
more violent.
And a lot of it is actually
happening with stranger crime,
even though it's not as
prevalent as known crime, it
still creates that sense of fear
in people.
>> Jennifer, I want to stick
with you when you talk about
sort of the rural when we think
of crime, it's often associated
with big cities.
But as you mentioned, the
project that you're working on
and sort of want to get a sense
of rural areas, are people just
as fearful of crime living in
where you are, say, in rural
Alberta versus, say, Edmonton or
Calgary?
>> Absolutely.
And I actually am the chair of
the police committee in rural
Alberta here.
And there is an increase in
property crime.
And the RCMP have noted that.
And interestingly, starting in
2023, they've seen an increase
in violent crime.
A lot of it is associated with
domestic violence.
So the offenders are known to
the victim.
But a lot of the drug issues are
moving to rural Alberta, which
from the urban areas and they're
breaking into people's homes,
which is creating an increased
fear.
And because the RCMP are often
15, 20 minutes, hours away from
helping somebody, there is that
fear that they're not going to
be able to be saved if they
catch an intruder in the action.
>> Steve.
>> Yeah, and I really want to
follow up on that.
You know, those personal crimes
like the home invasion is the
prototypical because it's not
just like, imagine when we sit
and watch the news, we see a
bunch of things that we don't
think really, you know, another
tow truck is on fire and
they're.
And what are these tow truck
people doing?
But it doesn't really feel
personal to us.
The home invasions, do.
You know, we can kind of feel
that.
And as a result, we're more
likely to remember those
stories.
And when we estimate the
probabilities of events, one of
the things we use is something
called the availability
heuristic.
How quickly can we bring to mind
examples of that event.
And these home invasions come to
mind pretty quickly.
So they're probably having a
disproportionate impact on on
how we all, you know, figure out
how likely is this.
And we probably think it's far
more likely than it is.
>> Help us understand a little
bit in terms of the brain.
You know, when we see these
videos on social media, when we
see these videos on the news,
what what is our instinct?
What are we doing?
Is it I think we've had a lot of
conversation of, you know, here
in Canada about, you know, what
laws we can do as homeowners to
protect ourselves.
There is this, you know, when we
talk about the, you know, the
fear, there's the flight, there
is the freeze.
Help us understand sort of how
the brain is working when when I
am watching a video of a smash
and grab on social media.
>> Yeah, yeah.
So really, every sensory bit of
information that comes into the
brain goes through these little
things called the amygdala, a
little almond shaped part of our
brain on either side.
And the amygdala's job is to
sense danger.
It's it's there to keep us
alive.
And when it detects something
threatening and threat is in a
very general sense, it doesn't
have to be somebody with a
baseball bat.
It could be an embarrassment or
social, you know, threats.
They'll kick in this fight,
flight freeze system in social
media.
You know, freeze doesn't really
make a whole lot of sense.
Flee.
I wish a lot more people were
fleeing social media than they
are.
They're not.
So what does that leave you?
It leaves you.
Fight and fight in social media
really means to share, to kind
of let people know, hey, here's
this danger.
And so that's another
amplification.
Now, something that scares you,
you're more likely to share.
And that's going to make it more
prevalent for everybody else.
>> Jennifer, when we see people
doing, for example, hard drugs
on the street or someone having
a mental health episode in
public, what does that do to our
sense of safety?
>> Well, it creates a greater
level of fear, because
oftentimes you feel helpless,
and because a lot of cities and
areas across Canada are having
less police officers, they feel
that that safety element isn't
always readily available to
them.
And I can personally say that I
used to work downtown Calgary,
and it wasn't as bad as it is
now.
And I know that when I'm walking
in downtown Calgary, I mean, you
see homeless individuals, you
see drug people like people
whacked out on whether it's meth
or whatever it is.
And it is it's frightening
because they become
confrontational.
And a lot of times people don't
know how to react in those
situations.
>> Steve.
Yeah.
>> And even when they don't
become confrontational, the
brain naturally is fearful of
things we don't understand very
well.
And those could be people's we
don't understand very well.
But again, when we see, you
know, some of these individuals
on the street and we don't quite
get how they got there, and we
don't really understand if
they're dangerous or not.
You know, a lot a lot of the
people experiencing
homelessness, for example, are
not dangerous at all.
But because we don't really
understand that it's scary to
the brain.
The the brain likes to be able
to predict how people are going
to respond and how people are
going to act.
When we feel like we don't have
that prediction, we're not sure
what they're going to do, then
they become scary.
>> Jennifer, you were.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
>> Yeah.
So I was just going to jump in
with the study that we're doing
right now.
A lot of police officers are
actually saying that the
homeless population are fearful
for their lives because they're
they're living in tent cities.
They're living in areas where
they don't feel safe and they
have nowhere else to go.
And so that I agree with what
Steve is saying is that is
absolutely a threatening thing
for even those individuals.
>> Yeah.
>> Jennifer, I want to stick
with you.
You were a police officer with
Calgary Police Services for 14
years.
You had mentioned sort of the
shortage of police officers is
having more visible police
presence, a potential answer to
addressing people's fears?
>> Absolutely.
And in Calgary here, the chief
of police actually had our
sheriffs or our provincial
police service partner with the
Calgary police, and all they did
was walk around downtown Calgary
talking to people, dealing with
the crime element and the level
of safety that resulted in that
initiative was amazing.
And I think that is actually why
the Calgary police put in a foot
patrol in downtown Calgary,
because individuals working in
the high rises were feeling less
safe, and so having more boots
on the ground and visible,
police can actually give
individuals that level of
safety.
>> What about people who have or
communities rather that have a
poor relationship with police?
Jennifer.
>> In that case, I think it's
important and incumbent on the
police to interact and engage
with those individuals.
And I know that the Calgary
police and the RCMP as well,
they hold community forums which
invite individuals that maybe
have questions about how the
police function if they come
from a different country, where
the relationship with the police
is is not a good one, and trying
to build those relationships,
and I think those are very
important.
And I would also suggest that
people try and do ride alongs so
they can see what police
actually deal with on a day to
day basis and see that it is a
difficult job.
>> Steve, I imagine for some
people, even here in Toronto,
for people who take transit, for
example, seeing someone in
uniform might help them, give
them a sense of safety.
And I'm just wondering, do you
think a greater police presence
is the answer, or do we need to
address perhaps the root cause
of some of these issues?
>> I mean, when it comes to
perceptions, it can be tricky.
Obviously we want to be after
the root causes.
We want to try to reduce crime.
But but certainly having police
officers around, especially as
Jennifer suggests, if you feel
comfortable and connected to
those officers, if they have
that community policing kind of
vibe, what that does for us is
if we're on the subway and
there's some characters that
we're a little unsure of again,
and we're getting a little
scared because we don't know how
they're going to act.
You know, if there's an officer
nearby, we know this is going to
sound kind of nasty, but this is
how society works.
It's their problem, right?
If that person starts to get
whatever, I don't have to do
something about it.
Either escape or actually, you
know, step in.
God forbid many of us would be
worried about doing that.
So to know, hey, that's their
job.
When when things start to go
wrong, they're going to step in.
And that means I don't have to.
That's that's a huge level of
comfort.
And it's what we rely on on
officers for every day.
>> I do have to ask this
question now, Jennifer, you
don't obviously speak for any
police service right now,
specifically the Toronto Police
Service, which is one service
that got a lot of attention in
2024 when this was at the height
of home invasions.
I don't know if you had heard
the story, but there was a
police officer that had
suggested that residents leave
their car keys at the front of
the door to avoid confrontation
with thieves.
How does messaging sort of play
into this?
Because one, you know, for for a
lot of residents who heard that
message, just like Steve said,
seeing a police officer might be
okay, well, that's now not my
problem.
It's their problem.
But if police are perhaps
passing the puck in certain
situations, that that safety and
that that perception of safety
has eroded.
>> And I'm actually glad you
brought that up.
I'm well aware of that incident.
And among my friends who
continue to be police officers,
we've discussed that.
I disagree with that form of
idea.
You instead, they should be
looking at things like, okay,
installing cameras because
cameras not only make you feel
safer, they help the police
determine who may be broke in or
is trying to break into their
place.
Giving them ideas for safety
would be a better idea, in my
view, than saying, leave your
key fob at the front door like
it's akin to saying just leave
your door unlocked, right, and
say, pretty much, come in and
take what you want and you're
good.
And I think that creates this
animosity amongst the public
when they see the police are
almost passing the buck, like
it's not our problem, just let
them take what they need and
then get on with your life.
But like Steve said, and I
alluded to, when someone breaks
into your home, that's a
violation of your personal
space, and that creates a level
of trauma and fear for a long
time after all.
>> Right.
We have about just under a
minute or so, and I want to get
a sense if people are feeling
anxious, Steve, about crime in
their communities, how should
they try to navigate around
them?
>> I mean, generally,
information is great.
Jennifer suggested going a ride
along.
I don't know, can any of us just
go on a ride along?
It's kind of cool if we can, but
but I think, you know, getting a
sense of the efforts that the
police are making and how you
and potentially your
neighbourhood, you know, you
can.
We think of old neighbourhood
watch programs and things like
that.
But but literally there's a lot
of security in that social
connection that even comes from
reaching out to your neighbours
and saying, you know, hey,
there's a bit of an issue here.
Can can we work together and
have eyes on the neighbourhood
and let each other know if
anything seems up?
You know, feeling like that's
that's part of a community
effort I think can help you feel
a lot more secure.
>> Jennifer I would also adding
on to that, educating yourself
about the court systems and how
individuals are released,
understanding that process,
understanding how police
function.
And like I go back to seeing how
they do their job can go a long
way and making society feel
safer because they see there
actually is processes that are
being followed and done.
>> We're going to have to leave
it there.
Jennifer.
Steve, really appreciate your
insights on this one.
Thank you so much.
>> Thank you, thank you.
>> We want this show to be for
you and about the things that
matter to you.
What do you want us to cover?
Let us know by going to
TVO.org/rundownfeedback
or leave us a comment on
Until then, see you tomorrow.
