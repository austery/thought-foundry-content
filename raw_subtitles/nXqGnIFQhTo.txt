Hi
 everybody.
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangan,
 the


CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 Sovereign
 Wealth


Fund
 and
 today
 I'm
 joined
 by
 Mike


Gitlin,
 president
 and
 CEO
 of
 Capital


Group,
 which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 world's


largest
 investment
 managers
 with
 more


than
 three
 trillion
 in
 assets.
 Now,
 more


importantly,
 Capital
 Group
 has
 a
 unique


approach
 to
 investing
 owned
 by
 its


employees
 and
 I
 kind
 of
 think
 that
 you


are
 the
 gold
 standard
 in
 investing,


Mike.
 So,
 great
 to
 have
 you
 here.


>> Well,
 thank
 you.
 We
 can
 end
 it
 there.


>> No
 way.
 No
 way.
 Now,
 uh,
 Capital
 Group,


you've
 been
 around
 for
 nearly
 100
 years.


Uh,
 but
 for
 those
 of
 uh,
 the
 listeners


who
 don't
 know,
 what
 do
 you
 do?


>> So,
 we
 manage
 money
 for
 people
 around


the
 world
 and
 those
 people
 may
 be
 served


by
 a
 financial
 advisor
 and
 they
 may
 be
 a


part
 of
 a
 a
 largecale
 institution
 like
 a


sovereign
 wealth
 fund,
 a
 defined
 benefit


plan,
 a
 defined
 contribution
 plan.
 So,


it's
 both
 a
 wealth
 management
 business


and
 an
 institutional
 business,
 but
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 all
 of
 that
 is


managing
 money
 for
 people
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day.


>> And
 you've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 you
 run
 the


retirement
 funds
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people.


How
 many
 people
 are
 you


>> are
 you
 helping?


>> There's
 over
 20
 million
 families
 in
 the


US,
 for
 example,
 that
 own
 something
 that


Capital
 Group
 does,


>> whether
 it's
 a
 mutual
 fund,
 an
 ETF,
 a


collective
 investment
 trust,
 whatever


way
 they
 consume
 that
 service.
 and


globally
 millions
 of
 people
 as
 well.


>> What
 is
 it
 that
 make
 you
 guys
 unique?


>> I'd
 say
 it's
 two
 things


>> apart
 from
 a
 really
 great
 co
 of
 course.


>> Oh
 jeez,
 we
 can
 end
 there.
 Uh
 so
 I
 think


two
 things
 make
 us
 unique.
 One
 is
 how
 we


manage
 our
 business
 and
 the
 other
 one
 is


how
 we
 manage
 our
 money.
 So
 in
 terms
 of


managing
 our
 business,
 we
 don't
 have
 to


think
 about
 quarterly
 earnings
 in
 the


public
 space.
 And
 we
 have
 shareholders


internally
 who
 understand
 that
 we're


investing
 in
 the
 business
 for
 the
 long


term.
 So
 the
 S&P
 500
 can
 be
 down
 20%.


And
 we
 can
 still
 invest
 in
 that


technology
 project
 that
 at
 another


company
 might
 just
 get
 stopped.


>> So
 we're
 able
 to
 invest
 through
 the


cycle
 in
 our
 own
 business
 which
 helps


our
 clients
 because
 we're
 stable.
 We're


not
 super
 reactive
 to
 the
 market


conditions
 in
 that
 regard.
 And
 then
 how


we
 manage
 our
 money.
 In
 1958,
 we


launched
 something
 called
 the
 capital


system.
 It's
 just
 a
 different
 way
 to


manage
 money
 than
 everybody
 else
 in
 the


world.
 And
 and
 I
 can


>> That's
 like
 your
 secret
 source,
 right?


>> It
 is.
 And
 I
 can
 speak
 about
 it.
 I


wasn't
 alive
 yet.
 It
 is
 a
 it
 was
 a


brilliant
 concept,
 but
 it
 came
 out
 of
 a


moment
 of
 challenge.


At
 that
 time,
 our
 founder
 had
 had
 a


heart
 attack,
 survived.
 when
 he
 came


back
 to
 the
 office
 said
 we
 can't
 manage


money
 with
 key
 person
 risk.


>> It's
 just
 not
 good
 for
 the
 clients.
 And


so
 the
 capital
 system
 was
 formed
 where


the
 analysts
 themselves
 are
 investors.


They're
 not
 credit
 raiders
 or
 stock


raiders.
 They
 invest
 real
 client
 assets.


And
 then
 you'd
 have
 multiple
 portfolio


managers
 collaborate
 in
 a
 portfolio
 as


opposed
 to
 just
 one
 person
 managing
 all


the
 money.


>> Why
 is
 why
 is
 that
 good?


>> It's
 good
 for
 a
 few
 reasons.
 One
 is
 an


analyst
 who
 manages
 money
 has
 skin
 in


the
 game.
 That's
 real
 client
 assets.


It's
 not
 a
 buy
 rating
 or
 a
 sell
 rating.


It's
 money.


>> That's
 a
 very
 different
 responsibility


when
 you're
 actually
 managing
 money.


>> So
 you
 make
 sure
 that
 more
 people
 sleep


badly
 at
 night.


>> So
 So
 one
 thing
 you
 could
 do
 when
 an


analyst
 manage
 money
 is
 they
 understand


portfolio
 risk.
 They
 understand


diversification.
 They
 understand
 how
 to


participate
 in
 the
 new
 issue
 or
 the
 IPO


market.
 They
 just
 have
 a
 different
 way


they
 go
 about
 them
 than
 an
 analyst
 who


raised
 credits.
 And
 then
 for
 portfolio


managers,
 I
 think
 the
 biggest
 difference


is
 you're
 not
 left
 with
 one
 individual's


300th
 best
 idea.


>> You
 get
 the
 strongest
 convictions
 from


several
 portfolio
 managers
 in
 the
 same


strategy.
 Everything's
 open.
 Everybody


can
 see
 everything.
 But
 you
 can
 express


conviction
 without
 feeling
 like
 the


weight
 of
 the
 entire
 portfolio
 is
 on


your
 individual
 shoulder.
 But
 one
 person


is
 responsible
 for
 each
 investment.


>> Each
 investment
 strategy
 has
 a
 principal


investment
 officer.
 They
 are
 the


conductor
 of
 the
 orchestra
 and
 they
 have


accountability.
 But
 there'll
 be
 a


research
 portfolio
 and
 there'll
 also
 be


other
 portfolio
 managers
 alongside
 all


in
 the
 same
 strategy
 all
 expressing


their
 conviction.
 It's
 it's
 just


different.


>> So
 if
 one
 product
 does
 badly,
 you
 do
 you


fire
 the
 whole
 team
 or
 you
 fire
 one
 guy


one
 person
 or
 what
 what
 do
 you
 do?


>> Well,
 we
 don't
 really
 think
 about
 it


that
 way.
 We
 we
 think
 about
 who's


participating
 in
 the
 portfolio.
 What
 are


their
 risk
 characteristics?
 We
 try
 to


combine
 people
 with
 complimentary


skills.


>> We
 have
 so
 much
 data
 on
 them.
 So
 we
 know


their
 upside
 capture,
 downside
 capture.


We
 know
 how
 they
 manage
 money
 because
 as


an
 analyst,
 remember
 is
 how
 much
 of
 an


increase
 in
 a
 share
 price
 do
 you


actually
 manage
 to


>> or
 the
 or
 the
 overall
 market
 when
 the


market's
 going
 up
 a
 lot
 or
 down
 a
 lot?


How
 much
 do
 you
 participate?
 Are
 you


more
 defensive?
 or
 you're
 more


offensive.


>> So,
 you
 want
 to
 participate
 a
 lot
 on
 the


upside
 and
 when
 it
 goes
 down,
 you
 don't


want
 to
 participate.


>> Well,
 that's
 right.
 And
 not
 everyone
 can


do
 that
 well,
 both
 sides.
 So,
 trying
 to


figure
 that


>> How
 does
 it
 help
 learning?
 How
 does
 it


help
 learning
 and
 knowledge
 transfer?


The
 fact
 that
 you
 have
 these
 people


working
 together,


>> I
 think
 what
 you
 have
 is
 you
 have
 people


sitting
 around
 the
 table
 in
 a
 certain


investment
 unit
 and
 everything's
 open.


There's
 no
 hierarchy.


>> You're
 a
 portfolio
 manager.
 I'm
 an


analyst.
 It's
 not
 hierarchical.


And
 so
 we
 all
 share
 ideas.
 All
 the


portfolios
 are
 open
 so
 everybody
 can
 see


them.
 And
 what
 it
 does
 is
 it
 gets
 the


ideas
 all
 on
 the
 table.
 And
 because
 you


and
 I
 can
 express
 our
 convictions,
 it


doesn't
 promote
 an
 environment
 of
 group


thing.


>> You
 might
 have
 serious
 conviction
 in


these
 names,
 I
 in
 different
 names,
 and


we
 can
 do
 that
 in
 the
 portfolio
 because


we'll
 have
 some
 diversification
 benefits


from
 the
 client
 on
 an
 overall


perspective.
 So
 it
 just
 makes
 a
 really


open
 conversation
 at
 the
 table.


>> These
 portfolio
 managers,
 they
 hang
 in


there
 for
 ages,
 right?
 I
 mean,
 is
 is
 it


right
 that
 the
 average
 tenure
 is
 more


than
 20
 years?


>> Yeah.
 Our
 folks
 stay.
 Why?
 They
 stay


because
 of
 the
 culture.
 They
 stay


because
 of
 the
 nature
 of
 the


shareholding.
 Um,
 and
 they
 stay
 because


they
 love
 Capital
 Group.
 I
 mean,
 they


come.
 We
 tell
 people
 when
 we're


interviewing,
 if
 you
 don't
 think
 you're


going
 to
 be
 here
 for
 your
 entire
 career,


don't
 come.
 So
 our
 attrition
 rate
 for


investment
 professionals
 is
 in
 low


single
 digits.
 I
 mean
 they
 do
 come
 for


their
 careers.


>> Now
 who
 uh
 does
 best
 at
 capital?
 What


are
 kind
 of
 the
 quality
 characteristics


of
 the
 best
 portfolio
 managers?


>> Portfolio
 managers
 who
 get
 smarter
 and


smarter
 over
 time
 but
 don't
 engage
 in


style
 creep.
 They
 know
 the
 kind
 of


manager
 they
 are,
 the
 kind
 of
 investor


they
 are.
 And
 when
 markets
 are
 really


skewed
 one
 way
 or
 the
 other,
 they
 don't


engage
 in
 style
 creep
 so
 that
 when
 the


market
 reenters,
 they're
 not
 caught
 off


sides.


>> That's
 really
 important.
 We
 we
 can
 take


care
 of
 because
 we
 put
 different


portfolio
 managers
 and
 analysts
 into


portfolios
 from
 a
 top-
 down
 perspective.


We
 can
 manage
 that
 kind
 of
 risk
 and


volatility.
 What's
 hard
 to
 do
 is
 if
 they


change
 their
 style
 midstream,


that
 becomes
 a
 problem
 because
 then
 you


get
 a
 skew
 in
 their
 portfolio
 that
 was


>> and
 when
 you
 say
 style,
 you
 mean
 things


like
 value
 investor
 or
 growth
 investor?


>> Yeah.
 You're
 more
 growthy.
 Are
 you
 more


value
 and
 dividend
 and
 income
 focused


and
 in
 a
 roaring
 bull
 market?
 Have
 you


shifted
 that
 style
 so
 dramatically
 that


you
 no
 longer
 recognized
 as
 the
 investor


we
 thought
 you
 were?
 Because
 if
 everyone


did
 that,
 the
 overall
 portfolio
 would


become
 way
 too
 growthy.


>> So
 trying
 to
 get
 people
 to


>> to
 tweak
 their
 styles
 with
 education
 and


over
 the
 market
 in
 the
 markets
 over


time,
 but
 not
 fundamentally
 change
 it


midstream
 because
 that
 be
 that
 becomes


more
 problematic.


>> How
 would
 you
 define
 the
 investment


philosophy
 of
 capital?


>> I'd
 say
 there
 is
 not
 one
 single


philosophy.
 Every
 individual
 has


autonomy.


If
 you
 and
 I
 are
 in
 one
 portfolio
 and


we're
 both
 managing
 five
 billion


dollars,
 we're
 all
 going
 to
 talk
 about


ideas.
 You're
 going
 to
 go
 away
 and


you're
 going
 to
 do
 what
 you
 think
 is


best
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 away
 and
 I'm


going
 to
 do
 what
 I
 think
 is
 best.


>> But
 do
 you
 have
 like
 a
 bible?
 You
 have


like
 you
 have
 one
 way
 of
 doing
 things.


>> It's
 not
 a
 bible.
 Um
 we
 try
 to
 have
 low


turnover
 because
 there's
 no
 such
 thing


as
 high
 turnover
 proving
 in
 correlation


terms
 to
 produce
 better
 investment


results.
 So
 in
 general,
 if
 you
 were


thinking
 stylistically,
 we
 tend
 to
 have


lower
 turnover
 than
 other
 managers
 of


people
 and
 also
 the
 portfolio.


>> We
 tend
 to
 have
 people
 who
 come
 a
 long


time,
 stay
 a
 long
 time
 and
 not
 a
 short


time.
 We
 have
 to
 manage
 at
 scale.
 We
 do


manage
 $3.2
 trillion
 dollars
 of
 assets.


So
 we
 have
 to
 manage
 at
 scale.
 I
 think


those
 those
 are
 the
 biggest
 factors.


>> Long-termism,


>> how
 does
 that
 come
 into
 play
 here?


>> It's
 interesting.
 Incentive
 systems
 are


a
 very
 interesting
 thing.


>> I'm
 a
 believer
 in
 incentive
 systems.


They
 drive
 behavior.
 Period.


The
 number
 one
 driver
 of
 an
 analyst
 or


portfolio
 manager's
 quantitative


compensation
 is
 their
 8-year
 number.


>> That's
 a
 long
 time,
 huh?


>> It's
 a
 long
 time.
 Well,
 a
 and
 in
 a
 world


where
 short-
 termism
 can
 be
 favored
 and


create
 additional
 volatility,
 when


you're
 eight
 years
 first
 and
 then
 five


and
 then
 three
 and
 your
 one
 year
 is
 the


lowest


component,


>> smallest
 component
 of
 your
 compensation,


it
 says
 don't
 be
 a
 hedge
 fund
 manager.


Manage
 for
 the
 long
 term.
 In
 my
 podcast,


the
 first
 guest
 I
 had
 was
 Rob
 Loveace.


>> He's
 been
 at
 Capital
 Group
 40
 years.


He's
 also
 the
 grandson
 of
 the
 founder.


He
 has
 excellent
 investment
 results.
 And


I
 said
 to
 him,
 "What's
 your
 edge?
 What's


your
 edge,
 Rob?"
 His
 answer
 was
 simple.


He
 said,
 "Time.
 I
 have
 the
 time
 to
 be


right."
 And
 so,
 you
 can
 go
 against
 the


grain.
 You
 could
 have
 a
 conviction
 that


might
 not
 start
 off
 perfectly,
 but
 come


into
 play
 as
 your
 thesis
 comes
 into


play,
 but
 the
 benefit
 of
 time
 is
 a
 huge


benefit.


>> You
 don't
 have
 that
 if
 your
 one-year


number
 drives
 your
 quantitative
 bonus.


>> No,
 but
 eight
 years
 is
 a
 long
 time.
 And


just
 to
 put
 it
 into
 perspective,
 we
 uh


we
 until
 recently
 had
 um
 you
 know
 three


year
 as
 the
 as
 the
 rolling
 number
 and
 we


have
 partly
 inspired
 by
 by
 you
 guys


moved
 um
 some
 of
 it
 to
 fiveyear
 but
 to


have
 people
 think
 about
 fiveyear
 results


you
 know
 in
 uh
 in
 this
 faster
 and
 faster


moving
 world
 that's
 uh
 that's


interesting.
 But
 I
 think
 about
 your


people
 and
 I
 think
 about
 your
 goals


going
 from
 three
 to
 five
 years.


Statistically,
 if
 you
 measure
 that
 over


the
 next
 10,
 20,
 30
 years,
 I
 bet
 you


have
 better
 investment
 results
 by
 having


that
 slightly
 longer
 time
 horizon,
 it


gives
 people
 confidence
 to
 have


conviction
 and
 not
 be
 so
 knee-jerk


reactive
 to
 one
 thing
 or
 another,
 but


stick
 with
 it.


>> Yep.
 Well,
 that's
 the
 plan.
 Why
 is
 it
 so


difficult
 to
 be
 long-term?
 I
 think
 it


can
 be
 difficult
 because
 of
 client


expectations.


Um
 I
 think
 the
 world
 in
 everything
 is
 so


much
 more
 short
 term
 in
 people's


attention
 span


um
 the
 news
 cycle
 everything.
 And
 so


when
 you're
 trying
 to
 say
 well
 we're


saving
 for
 retirement
 that
 can't
 fall


into
 the
 the
 wave
 of
 short
 termism.


We're
 trying
 to
 think
 of
 you
 when
 you're


38,
 how
 you're
 gonna
 live
 when
 you're
 70


and
 80
 and
 90.
 And
 so
 it
 does
 us
 no
 good


to
 look
 at
 every
 single
 quarterly


earnings
 and
 make
 a
 reactive
 decision


based
 on
 a
 business
 that's
 going
 to
 grow


12%
 compounded
 for
 the
 next
 25
 years.


>> Supposedly,
 uh,
 compared
 to
 30
 years


ago,
 we
 both
 speak
 and
 walk
 10%
 faster


than
 we
 did
 because
 they
 measure
 average


walking
 speed
 in
 cities.
 And
 when
 you


and
 we
 look
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 movies


that
 you
 liked
 when
 you
 were
 young,
 I


mean
 now
 they
 are
 just
 like
 a
 yawn,


right?
 Nothing
 happens.
 And
 so
 kind
 of


the
 cuts
 has
 gone
 from
 minutes
 to


seconds.
 It's
 just
 interesting
 how


>> it
 is
 the
 whole
 speed
 is
 accelerating.


>> Well,
 that's
 why
 everything
 streaming
 is


43
 minutes.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 mean
 it's
 the
 it's
 the
 attention
 span.


>> Yeah.
 Or
 the
 TED
 talks
 like


>> 18
 or
 whatever.
 Um
 now
 another
 thing


which
 has
 changed
 is
 the
 whole
 kind
 of


active
 passive


>> strategy.
 So,
 how
 do
 you
 see
 that


impacting
 the
 asset
 management
 industry?


>> Well,
 30
 years
 ago,


a
 little
 more
 than
 30
 years
 ago,
 passive


didn't
 exist.


So,
 now
 it's
 about
 half
 the
 marketplace


in
 equities.
 So,
 it's
 massively


impactful.


Um,
 and
 what
 it's
 done
 with
 flows
 into


passive
 is
 it
 makes
 a
 benchmark
 even


more
 concentrated.


When
 I
 look
 at
 our
 institutional


business,
 we're
 seeing
 our
 requests
 for


proposals,
 our
 RFPs
 go
 up
 to
 the
 right.


So
 why
 is
 that?
 One,
 I
 think
 it's


because
 people
 recognize
 the
 benchmarks


are
 super
 concentrated
 with
 half
 of
 the


assets
 going
 into
 passive
 and
 fewer


amount
 of
 assets
 in
 active
 management
 in


relative
 terms.


That
 skews
 the
 market
 and
 it
 makes
 this


concentrated
 benchmark.
 So
 people
 are


literally
 looking
 for
 diversification


away
 from
 a
 concentrated
 benchmark.
 I


never
 thought
 I'd
 say
 that.


>> The
 whole
 concept
 of
 passive
 was
 to
 be


diversified.


>> So
 just
 so
 passive
 i.e.
 you
 just
 buy
 the


index.


>> Just
 buy
 the
 index.


>> And
 so
 for
 us,
 I
 mean,
 I
 like
 to
 say


there's
 53,000


and
 seven
 public
 companies.
 There's
 not


seven
 public
 companies.
 M


>> and
 so
 having
 the
 opportunity
 to
 move


away
 from
 the
 skewed
 benchmark
 and
 find


opportunities
 outside
 of
 that
 globally


is
 a
 great
 advantage
 for
 active
 managers


and
 I
 think
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 that


now.
 It
 depends
 on
 the
 manager
 and
 I'm


sure
 we'll
 talk
 about
 that.
 Um,
 but
 not


all
 the
 managers
 have
 strong
 results


versus
 the
 benchmarks.
 And
 I
 think


people
 were
 seeing
 low
 fees
 and
 active


managers
 not
 beating
 passive
 and
 that


pushed
 some
 of
 the
 assets
 into
 passive


and
 now
 they
 realize
 they
 have
 to
 pick


and
 choose
 between
 the
 active
 managers.


>> Tell
 me
 why
 is
 it
 so
 difficult
 to
 beat


the
 index?
 Well,
 it
 was
 difficult
 in
 the


last
 decade
 because
 of
 how
 skewed
 it


became
 and
 in
 some
 rules
 around


especially
 in
 the
 US
 and
 40
 act
 rules


around
 how
 funds
 can
 be
 managed,
 you
 had


concentration
 limits
 of
 how
 much
 you
 can


actually
 own
 in
 a
 single
 stock.
 So,
 as


the
 benchmark
 got
 more
 skewed,
 you


weren't
 even
 able
 to
 do
 that
 if
 you


wanted
 to.
 Um,
 and
 that
 became
 an
 issue.


As
 the
 market
 broadens,
 there's
 no


excuses
 for
 active
 managers
 not
 to
 beat


benchmarks.
 And
 I
 think
 you
 will
 see
 a


market
 broadening.
 You're
 already


starting
 to
 see
 that.


>> The
 more
 the
 market
 broadens,
 whether


it's
 in
 a
 country
 or
 globally,
 the
 more


opportunities
 there
 are
 for
 active


managers.
 And
 and
 we're
 heading
 into
 one


of
 those
 periods
 now,
 but
 from
 2010
 to


2020,
 heavily
 skewed
 benchmark,
 heavily


skewed
 results
 into
 a
 small
 number
 of


stocks.


>> Moving
 on
 to
 AI.
 How
 do
 you
 use
 AI
 in


capital?


>> Well,
 it
 depends.
 Uh
 it
 depends
 on
 the


group,


the
 operating
 group
 taking
 commoditized


functions,
 having
 them
 go
 away
 and


having
 those
 individuals
 spend
 their


time
 on
 higher
 value
 added
 activities.


And
 the
 world
 is
 doing
 that.
 I
 don't


think
 we're
 any
 different
 in
 that


regard.
 In
 the
 client
 group,
 you're


going
 in
 to
 see
 a
 financial
 advisor
 on


the
 wealth
 management
 side.
 Hit
 the
 prep


me
 button.
 It
 tells
 you
 everything
 about


that
 financial
 advisor
 that
 you've


already
 put
 in
 the
 system.


So
 you
 can
 make
 it
 a
 more
 productive


interaction
 with
 the
 advisor.
 You're
 not


going
 in
 there
 blind.
 You
 look
 at
 all
 AI


reads
 all
 of
 your
 notes
 and
 the
 prep
 me


session
 just
 makes
 it
 so
 much
 more


valuable.
 Translation,
 we
 put
 together


lots
 of
 value
 added
 content
 for
 our


clients.
 Translation
 makes
 it
 available


immediately
 for
 everybody
 around
 the


world
 in
 their
 language.
 These
 are
 just


really
 easy
 use
 cases.
 On
 the
 investment


management
 side,
 think
 about
 94
 years
 of


data.
 We've
 digitized
 our
 entire
 library


over
 94
 years.


Every
 single
 report
 on
 every
 single


stock
 ever
 written
 at
 Capital
 Group,


that's
 a
 proprietary
 advantage.
 How
 we


utilize
 that
 data
 and
 structure
 that


data
 and
 and
 in
 investors
 as
 well.
 I'm


an
 investor.
 I've
 been
 at
 Capital
 Group


30
 years.


this
 environment
 has
 rates
 that
 are


coming
 down.
 Valuations
 are
 relatively


high.
 What
 mistakes
 have
 I
 made
 in
 in


the
 past
 in
 in
 the
 similar
 environments?


Goes
 through
 all
 of
 my
 data
 managing


money
 and
 it
 tells
 me
 things
 to
 be
 aware


of
 as
 this
 cycle
 may
 be
 the
 same
 or


different,
 but
 at least
 it
 gives
 me
 an


indication
 of
 some
 of
 the
 things
 I've


done
 in
 the
 past.
 So,
 trying
 to
 use
 all


the
 data
 we
 have
 to
 make
 better


decisions.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


opportunities
 in
 that
 space.


>> Yeah.
 Another
 thing
 which
 is
 changing
 is


of
 course
 the
 private
 market
 and
 you


just
 um
 entered
 a
 partnership
 with
 KKR.


Why
 did
 you
 decide
 to
 do
 that
 instead
 of


starting
 on
 your
 own?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 a
 great
 question.
 I
 mean
 we


had
 three
 choices.
 We
 could
 have
 bought


something,
 we
 could
 have
 built
 it


ourselves,
 or
 we
 could
 have
 partnered.


And
 I'm
 not
 being
 critical
 of
 others,


but
 one
 of
 the
 main
 reasons
 you
 would


build
 it
 yourself
 or
 you
 would
 buy


something
 is
 to
 retain
 100%
 of
 the


economics.
 That
 wasn't
 the
 driving
 force


for
 us.


To
 build
 it
 ourselves,
 you
 would
 then


have
 to
 be
 willing
 to
 practice
 on
 your


client's
 money,
 right?
 Because
 you
 don't


have
 it
 yet.
 And
 you'd
 also
 have
 to
 be


willing
 to
 either
 bring
 in
 a
 team
 which


could
 be
 a
 cultural
 challenge
 or
 take


people
 on
 your
 existing
 team
 and
 tell


them
 to
 do
 something
 different
 which


would
 distract
 them
 from
 the
 $3.2


trillion
 dollars
 we're
 already
 managing


today.
 So
 we
 weren't
 willing
 to
 do
 that.


The
 acquisition
 side
 again
 was
 a


cultural
 challenge.
 So
 the
 only
 thing
 we


had
 to
 believe
 in
 partnering
 is
 whoever


we
 partnered
 with
 could
 do
 it
 better


than
 us.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 we
 went
 through
 a
 diligence
 process.


We
 had
 a
 whole
 team
 due
 diligence
 on
 a


range
 of
 managers
 and
 we
 ended
 up
 with


KKR.
 They've
 done
 it
 for
 50
 years.
 We'll


let
 them
 do
 the
 private
 portion.
 We'll


do
 the
 public
 portion.
 We'll
 blend
 it


together
 in
 a
 client-friendly
 solution


that
 meets
 their
 needs
 and
 we'll
 make


sure
 we
 provide
 education.
 So,
 it
 was


just
 about
 not
 needing
 to
 achieve
 all


the
 economics,
 but
 be
 able
 to
 deliver
 a


better
 solution.
 It's
 literally
 what
 we


were
 talking
 about.
 That's
 not
 a
 sales


pitch.
 that
 was
 part
 of
 our
 management


committee
 discussion


>> of
 why
 we
 did
 it
 because
 it
 was
 the
 best


solution
 for
 our
 clients.


>> I
 think
 that's
 very
 straightforward.
 Uh


but
 it's
 not
 it's
 not
 necessarily
 the


path
 that
 I
 think
 everyone's
 going
 to


take.


>> Another
 way
 you
 are
 differentiated
 is


the
 way
 you
 are
 owned,
 right?
 So
 you
 are


owned
 by
 the
 partners.
 How
 does
 that


work?


>> Well,
 how
 many
 people
 would
 own
 it?
 I


would
 say
 it's
 rented
 by
 the
 owners,


>> meaning
 the
 owners
 own
 it
 until
 they


retire
 and
 they
 sell
 it
 back
 to
 the
 next


generation.


the
 founder.
 This
 is
 this
 is
 crazy
 to


think
 about
 94
 years
 ago,
 but
 94
 years


ago
 he
 founds
 this
 business


and
 says
 in
 three
 generations
 from
 now.


So
 he
 was
 thinking
 about
 his
 grandkids


>> who
 weren't
 born
 and
 saying
 when
 that


generation
 passes
 none
 of
 this
 none
 of


my
 family
 will
 own
 any
 of
 the
 stock.
 It


will
 all
 be
 owned
 by
 the
 people
 who
 work


at
 Capital
 Group
 at
 the
 time.
 Who
 would


think
 that
 94
 years
 ago?
 So,
 it's
 a
 very


well,
 it's
 really
 cool.
 And
 what
 it
 does


is
 say
 the
 mentality
 is
 if
 you're
 in
 it,


if
 you're
 picking
 stocks
 and
 bonds
 all


day
 long
 and
 servicing
 our
 clients
 all


day
 long,
 it's
 about
 you,
 not


necessarily
 the
 people
 who
 are
 retired


or
 the
 people
 who
 were
 integral
 to
 the


business
 50
 years
 prior.


>> So,
 you
 own
 it
 during
 the
 period
 of
 time


you're
 at
 Capital
 Group
 and
 then
 you


sell
 it
 back
 and
 we
 start
 again.
 How
 how


important
 do
 you
 think
 this
 has
 been?


>> I
 think
 it's
 huge.
 The
 way
 the
 Love
 Lace


family
 did
 it
 and
 now
 we
 can
 say
 no
 one


owns
 more
 than
 about
 1%
 of
 Capital


Group.
 So
 the
 ownership
 is
 really
 widely


dispersed.


>> It
 just
 means
 that
 all
 of
 those


individuals
 who
 are
 owners
 then
 are


participating
 in
 the
 outcome
 and
 feeling


as
 if
 their
 name
 is
 also
 on
 the
 door


when
 they
 walk
 into
 the
 building.


>> And
 I
 think
 that's
 really
 important.
 And


not
 everyone
 can
 be
 an
 owner.
 So
 we
 make


sure
 we
 have
 a
 large
 profit
 sharing


program
 where
 all
 of
 our
 9,400


associates
 do
 well
 if
 our
 clients
 do


well.
 So
 we
 do
 both,
 but
 both
 are


important.


>> Now
 many
 partnerships
 have
 gone
 public


and
 listed
 on
 a
 sock
 exchange,
 right?


Goldman
 Sachs
 and
 so
 on.
 Why
 have
 you


been
 close
 to
 doing
 that
 or
 is
 it


something
 you
 cannot
 do?


>> Well,
 we
 could


>> even
 even
 if
 you
 wanted
 to.


>> We
 could
 do
 it,
 we
 wouldn't
 do
 it.


Why
 would
 you
 take
 what
 may
 be
 one
 of


your
 biggest
 advantages
 and
 willingly


give
 it
 away?
 Well,
 some
 of
 these
 auto


partnerships
 have
 done
 it
 and
 they've


done
 really
 well
 as
 well.


>> And
 at
 the
 time
 they
 did
 that,
 there


were
 different
 reasons
 why
 they
 all
 may


have
 done
 that.
 That's
 not
 to
 judge


their
 decisions
 at
 that
 time.
 We
 don't


have
 to
 do
 that.
 We
 have
 an
 incredibly


strong
 balance
 sheet.


>> We
 have
 no
 long-term
 debt.


>> We
 don't
 need
 to
 sell
 the
 business.
 Any


one
 of
 the
 past
 generations,
 by
 the
 way,


could
 have
 monetized.
 Any
 one
 of
 them,


>> they
 could
 have
 monetized
 for
 their
 own


financial
 gain.


>> It's
 a
 mentality
 thing.
 Mhm.


>> We're
 supposed
 to
 take
 care
 of
 the


business,
 make
 it
 even
 better
 than
 it
 is


today,
 and
 pass
 it
 off
 to
 the
 next


generation
 to
 do
 the
 same.
 We
 like
 to


talk
 about
 writing
 a
 chapter
 in
 the


capital
 group
 book
 and
 then
 passing
 it


on
 for
 someone
 else
 to
 write
 the


chapter.


>> And
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 if
 you
 think
 of
 it


that
 way
 from
 the
 day
 you
 join
 until
 the


day
 you
 retire,
 it's
 an
 really


interesting
 mentality
 of
 the
 life
 cycle


of
 a
 company.


>> Now,
 you
 started
 a
 chapter
 like
 two


years
 ago
 when
 you
 became
 CEO.
 What
 were


the
 first
 thing
 you
 did
 when
 you
 took


over?


>> We
 uh
 you
 know
 capital
 groups
 and


another
 thing
 that
 makes
 us
 interesting


is
 we're
 not
 hierarchical
 meaning
 I'm


much
 less
 important
 than
 you
 just


insinuated
 as
 a
 CEO.
 We
 have
 three


senior
 leaders.
 Uh
 we
 have
 a
 management


committee
 of
 10.
 So
 the
 10
 of
 us
 got


together
 and
 collectively
 with
 the
 rest


of
 the
 organization
 wrote
 the
 next


long-term
 strategic
 plan.
 So
 2031
 is
 our


centennial.


We
 got
 together
 as
 a
 group
 and
 said


we're
 a
 new
 leadership
 team.
 Tim
 Armor


had
 retired.
 Rob
 Level
 still
 works
 at


Capital
 but
 came
 off
 the
 management


committee.
 We
 had
 a
 new
 group
 of
 senior


leaders
 and
 a
 couple
 additions
 to
 the


management
 committee
 and
 said,
 "Let's


write
 the
 long-term
 strategic
 plan


together."
 It's
 literally
 the
 first


thing
 we
 did
 as
 a
 group,
 which
 is
 really


liberating.
 And
 and
 the
 departing


leaders
 said,
 "Don't
 just
 do
 what
 we


did.
 M


>> don't
 rinse
 and
 repeat.
 Do
 it


differently.
 Do
 it
 better.
 Keep


evolving.


>> Have
 you


>> Have
 you
 started
 to
 plan
 your
 100y
 year


party?


>> I
 know.
 I
 sent
 one
 invite.
 Did
 you
 get


it?


>> Yeah.


>> So


>> So
 we


haven't
 started
 planning.


>> Yeah.
 But
 you'll
 still
 be
 around.
 So
 um


we
 haven't
 we
 haven't
 started
 planning


our
 party,
 but
 um
 we
 planned
 our


strategy.


>> And
 tell
 me
 about
 the
 strategy.


>> Strategy
 has
 four
 parts.
 And
 I'll
 make


it
 quick
 because
 no
 one
 likes
 to
 bore


anybody
 with
 a
 strategy
 or
 be
 bored.


>> Okay.
 In
 three
 points.


>> I'll
 do
 three
 and
 a
 half.
 Okay.


>> Um
 one
 is
 we
 have
 to
 manage
 money
 well.


That's
 what
 we
 do.
 So
 keep
 investing
 in


the
 capital
 system.
 Two
 evolve
 with


clients.


>> We
 have
 intellectual
 capital.
 How
 they


want
 to
 consume
 it.
 Institutional


separate
 account,
 collective
 investment


trusts,
 separately
 managed
 accounts,


ETFs.
 That's
 their
 business.
 We
 just


have
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 as
 they
 want
 to


consume
 that,
 we're
 able
 to
 do
 that
 for


them.
 And
 when
 they
 want
 us
 to
 blend


passive
 and
 private
 markets
 into
 our


active
 at
 the
 core
 strategies,
 we're


able
 to
 deliver
 solutions.
 So,
 keep


evolving
 with
 our
 clients.
 Three
 is


simplify
 and
 scale
 our
 business.
 Every


business
 to
 some
 extent
 is
 bloated
 by


its
 own
 bureaucracy.
 Period.


So
 what
 can
 we
 do
 to
 operate
 more


efficiently
 and
 effectively?
 And
 the


last
 one
 is
 invest
 in
 our
 associate


experience.
 We
 have
 half
 the
 attrition


rate
 of
 the
 industry.


>> So
 want
 to
 develop
 people,
 keep
 them.


It's
 disruptive
 to
 keep
 replacing
 people


every
 two
 years.
 So
 you
 have
 to
 give


them
 opportunities
 to
 develop
 their


careers
 and
 want
 to
 stay
 at
 the
 company.


We're
 not
 perfect
 at
 that,
 but
 we
 have


to
 get
 better
 at
 it.


>> Can
 we
 drill
 down
 a
 bit
 more
 on
 the


culture
 side?
 So
 now
 I
 uh
 I'm
 really


lucky.
 I
 get
 a
 job
 at
 Capital.
 I
 you


know
 uh


>> it's
 a
 long
 interview
 process.
 Are
 you


patient?


>> Let's
 start
 with
 that.
 So
 how
 long
 is
 it


long?
 I
 mean
 it
 can
 be
 anywhere
 from
 6


to
 12
 months
 and
 you
 know
 I
 was
 asked
 a


question
 in
 one
 forum.
 Someone
 said
 have


you
 ever
 lost
 a
 candidate
 because
 the


process
 was
 too
 long?
 And
 I
 said,
 'Yeah,


of
 course
 we
 have,
 but
 it's
 worth
 it


over
 the
 long
 run
 to
 take
 that
 time.


>> And
 can
 everyone
 veto
 and
 say,
 "Listen,


I
 don't
 like
 the
 look
 of
 that
 person."


>> The
 the
 good
 thing
 is
 nobody
 has
 veto


power
 on
 anything.


So,
 it's
 not
 it's
 not
 like
 that.


Everyone
 has
 a
 voice.
 Everyone
 can
 weigh


in,
 but
 nobody
 has
 veto
 power.
 But
 it's


important
 because
 you
 you
 want
 them
 to


interview
 us
 also.
 If
 they're
 going
 to


be
 there
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 their
 career,


they
 should
 be
 interviewing
 us
 as
 much


as
 we
 interview
 them.
 I
 think
 that's


super
 important.
 But
 we
 have
 a
 long


interview
 process.
 Um,
 if
 you're
 an


investment
 professional
 and
 you're


joining,
 you
 conduct
 an
 industry
 review.


Meaning,
 we
 tell
 you,
 don't
 be
 quote


unquote
 productive
 day
 one.
 Take
 three


to
 six
 months,
 look
 at
 a
 certain


industry,
 research
 it,
 and
 come
 to
 the


whole
 group
 and
 tell
 them
 what's
 your


portfolio
 going
 to
 look
 like
 as
 an


investor.
 And
 so
 we
 give
 people
 time
 to


do
 that
 instead
 of
 rushing
 them
 into
 a


portfolio
 management.


>> It's
 just
 another
 thing.
 It's
 part
 of


the
 system.


>> What
 are
 the
 other
 cultural
 things?


>> You
 know,
 I
 if
 you
 look
 at
 culture,


culture
 is
 an
 interesting
 thing
 because


some
 people
 their
 eyes
 glaze
 over
 when


you
 talk
 about
 culture.
 They
 feel
 like


it's
 so
 intangible.
 Does
 it
 really


matter?


>> It's
 everything
 that
 matters.


>> It's
 everything
 that
 matters.
 I
 agree


with
 you.
 And
 so
 from
 us,
 it's
 all
 in


the
 core
 values.
 Integrity.
 If
 you
 look


at
 financial
 advisors,
 we're
 rated


number
 one
 in
 trust.
 You
 have
 to
 have


integrity.
 It's
 what
 you
 do.
 It's
 our


whole
 business
 is
 built
 on
 integrity.


Diverse
 perspectives.
 The
 capital


systems
 built
 on
 diverse
 perspectives.


Long-term.
 We
 talked
 about
 eight-year


number
 driving
 quantitative
 bonuses.


>> Community.
 We
 want
 people
 to
 invest
 in


the
 capital
 community
 but
 also
 the


community
 they
 live
 in
 so
 we
 can
 be


responsible
 in
 that
 community.
 And
 the


fifth
 one
 is
 client
 focus.
 Are
 you


client
 focused
 or
 are
 you
 so
 focused
 on


your
 own
 P&L
 that
 you're
 not?
 That's
 a


huge
 thing.


>> What
 are
 the
 aspects
 of
 the
 of
 the


culture
 that
 you
 try
 to
 change
 or
 try
 to


improve?
 You
 know,
 the
 one
 thing
 that


we're
 getting
 better
 and
 better
 at
 is


not
 associating
 excellence


with
 speed
 or
 the
 lack
 thereof.
 Meaning,


at
 times
 in
 our
 past,
 we
 would
 be
 so


slow
 to
 do
 something
 because
 we
 were
 so


measured
 that
 we
 ended
 up
 at
 times


priding
 ourselves
 on
 slowness.
 I
 think


now
 the
 whole
 organization


whole
 organization
 recognizes
 we
 can


move
 at
 pace
 and
 still
 be
 excellent.


That's
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we're


doing
 more
 and
 more
 today.
 I
 think


that's
 really
 important.
 Can
 you
 do
 it


well
 and
 can
 you
 do
 it
 at
 pace
 because


the
 market's
 evolving.
 You
 and
 I
 talked


about
 it
 time
 before.
 The
 market's


evolving
 so
 much.
 You
 have
 to
 move
 at


pace.
 Yeah.


>> But
 you
 can't
 give
 up
 being
 really
 good


at
 it.


>> No,
 that's
 true.
 I
 saw
 some
 research


showing
 that
 organizations
 which
 take


fast
 decisions
 on
 average
 take
 better


decisions.


>> And
 we're
 getting
 faster.
 We'll
 never
 be


so
 fast
 that
 we're
 not
 researched,
 but


we're
 getting
 better
 at
 moving
 at
 pace.


>> Are
 you
 like
 really
 soft?
 Are
 you
 just


like
 really
 nice
 and
 kind
 all
 the
 time?


And


>> who?
 Capital
 Group
 or
 me?


>> Yeah.
 You
 know,
 you
 know,
 you
 like
 drink


hot
 chocolate
 every
 Friday
 and
 have
 kind


of
 cinnamon
 buns
 all
 over
 the
 place.


>> I
 I
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 that's


how
 people
 would
 describe
 Capital
 Group


and
 they
 certainly
 wouldn't
 describe
 me


like
 that.
 Um,
 I
 think
 we're
 nice,
 but


minus
 the
 hot
 chocolate.


>> How
 do
 you
 share
 information
 internally


between
 the
 teams?
 And


>> yeah,
 generally
 as
 much
 as
 we
 can
 in


person
 and
 verbally.


Um,


we're
 in
 the
 office
 four
 days
 a
 week
 at


Capital
 Group.
 We
 have
 Friday
 as
 a
 work


from
 home
 day.
 We
 like
 when
 people
 sit


around
 the
 table
 together
 and
 talk.
 It's


much
 better
 than
 just
 sending
 emails.


And
 I
 think
 that
 in-person


collaboration,
 our
 folks
 travel
 all
 the


time
 to
 other
 offices
 and
 to
 see


companies.


I
 hope
 in
 the
 world
 of
 AI
 and
 and
 other


ways
 to
 communicate
 rather
 than
 in


person.
 The
 virtual
 world
 doesn't


overwhelm
 what
 we
 can
 do
 together
 in
 a


conference
 room.


>> You
 you
 are
 in
 many
 cases
 also
 a
 bit
 of


a
 advisor
 to
 companies,
 right?
 They
 ask


for
 your
 advice.


>> They
 have
 we
 our
 our
 folks
 will
 present


at
 company
 board
 meetings
 regularly
 if


they
 ask
 us
 to
 come
 and
 do
 so
 to
 ask
 us


to
 share
 and
 I
 say
 us
 I
 mean
 our


investment
 professionals
 not
 me
 but
 they


ask
 us
 to
 share
 uh
 our
 views
 on
 the


industry
 or
 views
 on
 what
 makes
 that


company
 excellent
 and
 what
 they
 can
 do


better.
 So
 we
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 board


meetings
 for
 different
 CEOs
 that
 ask
 us


to
 do
 them.


>> As
 long
 as
 it's
 not
 on
 Fridays.
 Well,


probably
 because
 probably
 no
 one's


working
 on
 a
 Friday.


>> Tell
 me,
 is
 that
 something
 you
 always


had
 the
 Friday
 work
 from
 home
 or
 is
 that


a
 left
 left
 from
 COVID?


>> Postcoid.


>> And
 if
 you
 cancel
 that
 and
 went
 to
 5


plus,
 you
 know,
 5
 plus
 2
 instead
 of
 uh
 4


plus
 one,
 will
 you
 get
 a
 revolution?


>> We
 wouldn't
 get
 a
 revolution,
 but
 I


don't
 think
 it
 would
 win
 super
 high


marks
 from
 all
 of
 our
 associates.


>> But
 I
 think
 but
 but
 four
 days
 going
 from


three
 to
 four
 postco
 was
 important.


>> Yeah,
 we
 did.


>> I'm
 glad
 we
 did
 that.


>> Same
 here.
 No
 regrets.
 Um,
 and
 I
 don't


think
 our
 people
 have
 regrets
 on
 that


either.


>> No,
 but
 one
 day
 is
 important.
 It's


important
 to
 have
 one
 day
 flexibility.


>> And
 I
 think
 that
 flexibility
 is


something
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 considered


pre-COVID.
 It
 may
 be
 one
 of
 the
 benefits


postco.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 one
 day.


>> Yeah.
 When
 do
 you
 wake
 up
 in
 the


morning?


>> Four.


>> Wow.
 What
 do
 you
 do?
 What
 do
 you
 do
 when


you
 wake
 up?


>> Uh,
 well,
 it
 doesn't
 take
 me
 a
 long
 time


to
 do
 my
 hair,
 so
 I
 quickly
 get
 ready


and
 go
 into
 the
 office.
 I'm
 I'm
 in
 the


office
 by
 5.
 Um,


>> for
 the
 people
 who
 are
 not
 on
 uh
 any


visual
 hair
 or
 just
 on
 sound,
 he
 he's


got
 a
 pretty
 short
 haircut.


>> Yeah,
 super
 short.
 It's
 been
 short
 since


I've
 been
 29,
 but
 but
 I
 like
 I
 like


doing
 the
 early
 stuff.
 I'm
 not
 too


bright
 at
 nighttime.


>> All right.
 When
 do
 you
 go
 to
 bed?


>> 8:30,
 9.


>> How
 do
 you
 relax?


>> Uh,
 I
 spend
 time
 with
 my
 wife.
 We've


been
 empty
 nesters
 for
 6
 years.
 I
 walk
 a


lot.
 I
 read.


Um,
 spend
 time
 with
 the
 kids
 who
 are
 no


longer
 kids.
 They're
 adults.
 Um,
 so
 more


family
 things.


>> What
 do
 you
 read?


>> So,
 a
 bunch
 of
 things.
 I
 I'm
 a
 big
 fan


of
 fiction
 as
 opposed
 to
 non-fiction.
 My


my
 life
 is
 a
 non-fiction
 story.
 So,
 I


read
 a
 lot
 of
 fiction.
 Anything
 that


Jeffrey
 Archer
 writes,
 Steve
 Barry,


Daniel
 Silva,
 I
 love
 those
 kind
 of


books.
 Um,
 I
 read
 the
 regular


publications
 that
 all
 of
 us
 in
 the


finance
 industry
 read.
 So
 I
 read
 DFT,


Wall
 Street
 Journal,
 Barons.
 Um,
 and


then
 I
 read
 stuff
 inside
 at
 Capital


Group.
 I,
 you
 know,
 we
 have
 something


called
 Capital
 Connect
 where
 all
 of
 our


researches.
 I
 once
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time


reading
 external
 research.
 And
 I


realized
 reading
 the
 internal
 research,


I
 can
 still
 get
 that
 diverse


perspective,
 but
 I
 don't
 have
 the
 world


of
 volume
 coming
 at
 me.
 I
 can
 hunt
 and


peck
 within
 our
 own
 capital
 system.
 If


you
 were
 not
 in
 asset
 management,
 what


do
 you
 think
 you
 would
 be
 doing?


>> Probably
 be
 a
 teacher.
 Um,
 right
 when
 I


left
 university,
 my
 first
 job
 was


teaching
 in
 Australia,
 and
 I
 loved
 it.


It
 was
 a
 short
 period
 of
 time.
 Uh,
 but


I'd
 probably
 be
 a
 teacher.


>> What
 would
 you
 teach?


>> Uh,
 I
 I
 probably
 wouldn't
 teach
 the
 kind


of
 thing
 we're
 doing
 today
 in
 our


business,
 you
 and
 I.
 Um,
 maybe
 English


or
 history
 like
 I
 taught
 back
 then,
 but


I
 don't
 think
 I
 would
 get
 into
 the
 world


of
 teaching
 finance.
 First
 of
 all,
 I


probably
 don't
 know
 enough
 and
 second
 of


all,
 I'd
 want
 to
 do
 something
 different.


>> And
 what
 would
 be
 your
 advice
 to
 these


young
 students
 generally


when
 it
 came
 to
 their
 lives?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 interesting.
 Um,
 I
 think
 when


you're
 when
 you're
 young
 and
 just


getting
 into
 the
 workforce,


you
 think
 two
 things.
 You
 think
 you
 have


to
 know
 your
 future
 then,
 which
 none
 of


us
 do.
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 saw
 yourself


sitting
 in
 the
 seat
 you're
 sitting
 in


today
 40
 years
 ago.


>> Well,
 partly
 because
 the
 fund
 didn't


exist.


>> There
 you
 go.
 And
 I
 certainly
 didn't
 see


myself
 sitting
 in
 this
 seat.
 So,
 I
 tell


people
 try
 not
 to
 be
 too
 bright
 in
 terms


of
 the
 long-term
 future
 at
 inception.


The
 second
 part
 is
 be
 excellent
 at
 what


you
 do
 before
 you
 assume
 that
 you're


capable
 to
 do
 the
 next
 thing.


>> So,
 be
 excellent
 at
 what
 you
 do.
 You'll


stand
 out
 if
 you're
 excellent.
 be


curious
 and
 don't
 plan
 too
 far
 ahead.


>> Well,
 Mike,
 you
 clearly
 are
 excellent
 in


what
 you
 do
 and
 so
 when
 you
 uh
 become
 a


teacher,
 I'll
 sign
 up
 for
 your
 class
 as


long
 as
 you're
 willing
 to
 learn
 history


and
 English.
 Thank
 you.
 I
 appreciate
 it.
