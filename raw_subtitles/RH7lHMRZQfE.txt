>> US President Donald Trump
likes to think of himself as a
deal maker, but a lot of people
see him a little differently,
more like a hostage taker.
The common thread here.
Using leverage and threats to
force people to give him what he
wants.
So how do you deal with someone
like that?
The answer might not come from
political theory or diplomatic
playbooks, but from somewhere
else entirely.
Hostage negotiation.
We talked to a crisis
communicator about his
experience in high stakes
situations, and what it can
teach us about dealing with
Trump in tense moments.
The advice is usually simple
stay calm.
That's easier said than done,
especially online, and
especially when you come across
rage bait from people like, you
guessed it, Donald Trump.
In just the past few days, he's
gone after us Olympians, music
megastars and the Canadian
government.
We look at why anger is so
contagious online and how
politicians and others harness
its power.
This is The Rundown.
Donald Trump doesn't hesitate to
issue threats and promise harsh
consequences to get what he
wants.
So what actually works when
you're dealing with someone like
that?
We asked an experienced crisis
negotiator to weigh in.
J.
Paul Nadeau is a retired police
detective and hostage
negotiator, and he joins me in
studio.
How are you doing, Paul?
>> I'm doing well.
Jan, how are you doing?
>> I'm doing well.
Well, let's let's talk about it.
We know that numerous
politicians and media have used
the term taken hostage in
describing their negotiations
with Donald Trump.
Is that just hyperbole, or is
that, would you say, an accurate
description?
>> That would be an accurate
description.
Not only is it just dealing with
Trump, the state of the world
right now with the uncertainties
in democracy and in different
policies that are coming out,
are making people feel very,
very anxious and a hostage to
me.
When people think about
hostages, they think about
people in cages, they think
about people who have been taken
by force.
But really, when we take a look
at the state of the world, we
can still be taken hostage, even
though there are no cages around
us, because the people in
control can make us feel
unstable, worried, concerned.
So yes, that's a very accurate
description of what's happening.
>> Have we seen anyone like
Donald Trump before?
Sort of on the world stage
before?
>> Oh, we have.
Yes.
Throughout history we have seen
different people.
I'm not going to compare Donald
Trump to Hitler, but take a look
at what happened back then in
Germany with the dictatorships,
the the different approaches,
the rights that were taken away.
But throughout history, we have
had leaders who have really put
themselves first.
And consequently there's been
there's been a lot of of anger
and a lot of uncertainty in the
world.
>> All right.
In your book, The Hostage
Effect, you speak about the
re-election of Donald Trump as
being sort of the catalyst for
for why you decided to write
this book.
Help me understand that.
>> When Donald Trump was
elected, I started to feel like
a hostage myself.
Like, what's going to happen
next?
He was talking about taking over
Canada, taking over Greenland,
all kinds of information was
coming out and uncertainty.
And I felt, well, what's going
to happen next?
Every day there was a new
announcement and I felt anxious,
and someone I know quite well
reached out to me and says, are
you feeling this, too?
And I said, yeah.
She says, if there was ever a
time for you to talk about how
the world is feeling like a
hostage, it's now.
And I thought about that and I
thought, you're right.
We are feeling like hostages.
We're being taken captive.
>> There are obviously a number
of stories in your book that you
talk about, and I want to get
sort of into the headspace of a
negotiator.
What are some of the early signs
that a person is becoming a
hostage in their situation, that
you write about.
>> When they feel that their
voices are being silenced, when
they feel that at any time their
safety can be jeopardised, their
security can be jeopardised,
their jobs can be gone.
When a person feels that they
are immobilised and unable to
move forward from the fear of
what our leaders will do or say
or take away from us.
That is a state of hostage.
When I talk about the hostage
effect, it's almost like a
virus.
It's a conditioning.
You will listen to me and this
is what's going to happen.
So that's how people are
feeling.
>> The what sort of mindset is
best when preparing to enter a
crisis negotiation?
We won't talk necessarily as
politicians in this case, but as
a negotiator yourself.
What does that mindset when
you're entering into a
situation?
Or perhaps there is a story that
you would like to share.
>> When I'm preparing for a
negotiation, I am trying to find
out as much as I possibly can
about the person I'm about to
negotiate with.
What intelligence do we have?
I'm going from a hostage
negotiators standpoint.
What do we know about this
person?
What are the circumstances?
What are the barriers in front
of it?
How am I going to approach?
Well, the first thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to seek first
to understand and then to be
understood, because people want
to be heard, they want to be
seen, they want to be felt.
So when you're negotiating with
someone in a conflict or even in
a political situation, your
approach has to be amicable, has
to be open, and has to be
someone who's inquiring, what is
it that we can do together to
work throughout this difficult
situation that we're both, you
know, what is it that we both
want and how can we resolve
this?
And that's the mindset of a
hostage negotiator.
I understand you're going
through a lot.
Hey, Jeyan, I understand.
I'm here to help.
That's how I would approach you.
If you had a hostage.
And I would say, tell me what's
going on so that I have a better
understanding of where I can
actually help you to reach what
it is that you're trying to
reach.
>> When we talk, when we when we
say hostage, you know, hostages,
hostage negotiations, I think we
we tend to think of movies and
we tend to think of, you know,
the negotiator has been called
in.
There's a phone line, the person
is far away.
You are now brought in, you
know, the sort of the tent or
temporary sort of setup.
You come in, you grab the phone
and you start talking.
Help me understand some of the
stories.
If there was one negotiation
that sticks in your mind to this
day.
What is can you help us
understand what that situation
was on both ends for the person
that you were talking to, but
what you were doing?
>> Oh, absolutely.
And what you described in the
movies.
>> Many accurate.
>> Very.
Okay.
Yeah.
For the most part.
And that's exactly what it is.
We don't want face to face
negotiations when there's
somebody holding a weapon.
Because the danger is quite
significant.
So the telephone conversation
and reaching someone I remember
negotiating with a man who was
distraught, and he had taken his
his estranged wife and his four
year old daughter hostage, and
he had threatened to harm them
before and to take their lives
and to take his own.
And I just remember getting on
the phone with him and
establishing that, hey, my name
is Paul, I'm the negotiator.
I'm here to help.
And we then engaged in a
conversation where I asked him
to tell me what was going on in
his mind, like, where are you
right now?
What's happening?
And then focusing on the love he
had for his daughter.
And and that became a catalyst
to find out what mattered to him
the most.
What matters to you here?
And do you want to harm your
daughter?
Sometimes you have to ask the
hard questions.
And through that conversation,
what I had him do is open up and
realise what really was
important to him, and then work
with him to get him to a state
where it took time, but where he
understood that in everybody's
best interest, it was time to
release the child.
It was time to release his wife.
But first I had to get him to
the door, which fortunately.
And that was a very, very hard
negotiation.
It worked.
Everybody lived.
And that's what we're looking to
do.
>> Let's return back to Trump in
the sense of his personality
might be a bit erratic, where
maybe some people might not be
able to to sense from one day to
the next where he's going to be,
you know, if you're on his, on
his socials, it's, you know, a
late night text sort of sends
the world into a bit of chaos.
But knowing what we know about
Donald Trump, what are the most
important aspects of his
character for a negotiator to
keep in mind?
As you mentioned, when you go
into these negotiations, you get
a sense of who they are before.
What do we know about him, and
what are the ones that stick out
to you as something, as someone
who would go into a negotiation?
>> He's very focussed on
acquiring a number of different
things, and and money is one of
them.
He he says that he has the best
interests of the United States
in hand, and he's making some,
some pretty harsh claims.
He's doing some good in many
areas, but in other areas it
feels like he is really
dictating the way things are
going to happen.
A negotiator has to approach
that with an open mind and
establish a rapport, because
when somebody knows you, likes
you and trusts you, they're more
willing to work with you.
We don't always have to agree
with the person that we're
discussing or negotiating with,
but we certainly have to let
them speak and to have them feel
like they're being heard and
feel like they're being
understood.
Unless we do that, there is no
way of succeeding.
And again, it comes down to
trust, likeability.
And those are the important keys
that will get you to say, well,
how is it that we can work
together to make this work?
>> Do you want to clarify that
Donald Trump is not literally
taking hostages at the moment?
We're talking theoretical ones,
of course.
>> No, absolutely, absolutely.
>> I do want to understand sort
of the hostage negotiation
principles that you have trained
on that you've used.
Do they like which ones
genuinely transfer to someone
like Donald Trump?
And then where do the analogies
break down, where, you know,
this is someone where you're
going to have to apply something
a little different.
>> The hostage negotiator
approaches work in every
circumstance.
And I teach this in business.
And everywhere there is, there
is a way of approaching an
individual that makes them feel
heard.
As I said earlier too.
And it takes into consideration
what they're going through
because everybody is going
through something different.
But unless we have an inquiring
mind and ask these, these things
of people, we'll never know.
So the approach is one of
openness, one of willingness to
to work.
And if there is a conflict
willing to work through that
conflict, where it falls apart
is where people stop
communicating or put their hands
up and say, listen, I've had
enough of this, and you don't
see things my way.
It's like hostage negotiator.
If I if if I had a hostage taker
who had four hostages, if I
wasn't getting along, wasn't
willing to open up and take the
time, it takes time.
But if I was at that point where
I said, listen, John, okay,
we're just not getting along,
how about you keep two hostages
and you give me two hostages?
We'll call it a day.
You can't do that, right?
You have to stay in for the long
run and work as as meaningful as
you possibly can to keep that
negotiation going.
Sometimes it's going to be
rough.
You have to go back and and
regroup, rethink re-approach.
I don't see that happening.
>> I want to what's a little bit
different from perhaps some of
the negotiations, as you
mentioned, with one of your
examples, these are done
privately on a phone call.
There's not a lot of noise.
What we're seeing with Donald
Trump is, as we mentioned,
social media, we're seeing press
conferences.
When you talk about the word
ambush, I think a lot of people
think of, you know, Zelensky
meeting Donald Trump in the
white House and, you know, two
leaders across from each other.
And that was, again, not a
negotiation of any sort.
But what how does the
negotiation change when the
subject is performing for an
audience, their supporters on
media, for example?
>> It changes because I believe
it's a matter of not being
understood or throwing yourself
out there and saying, look, it's
me, look how tough I am.
And that's going to happen in
certain situations where an
individual for the media will
strike their chest and say, it's
my way or the highway, and
sometimes you just can't
negotiate with someone who is in
that state of mind, not at that
time.
And then in the background,
there has to be other ways and
means of trying to reach out and
renegotiate and have that
openness and that willingness.
>> Some might say that this is
Donald Trump trying to get
leverage in some of these
situations.
What do you say to that?
>> I say that's true.
Yeah, I say that that that's
very true in his mind.
And I can't go back and tell you
exactly where this all
originated from.
But yes, he does want leverage.
And we're seeing that in many
instances where certain things
are being taken, almost taken
away from people.
That's why they're feeling like
hostages.
>> There are many folks who
wonder why even bother picking
up the phone or even keeping
that line active.
Why not just hang it up?
Why?
Why even bother negotiating with
Trump?
>> Imagine not.
Imagine not standing up and and
taking whatever action you
possibly can.
Rightful action.
Imagine just giving up and
saying, okay, you got it all.
When people don't express their
opposition and do it in a
peaceful way, then everything
will be taken away.
Our rights, our voices, our
privileges.
This is why it's so important to
continue to negotiate with
someone like Trump, or to
continue to do peaceful
resistance as to what you see as
an injustice, because not doing
it makes you that hostage we're
talking about.
You think you're a hostage now
give up on on negotiating with
Trump.
Give up on speaking about what
you feel are injustices within
your country.
And 1984 is right around the
corner.
>> Let's talk about our lead
negotiator here in this country,
Mark Carney.
I'm going to play to the movies
here.
If you found yourself in an
elevator with Carney,
maybe you've got 30 seconds
before he goes.
What advice would you give him
as he enters another round of
negotiations with Donald Trump?
>> Learn how to negotiate.
Learn how to learn how to to
speak, to listen and to show
genuine interest.
I would say.
You have to take a stance and
you have to do it with a certain
amount of authority, but you
also have to be willing to
listen.
And again, I go back to what
Stephen Covey has said for many,
many years.
And in his books and his speaks,
his talks seek first to
understand, then to be
understood.
Know what you want out of the
deal, but also ask the other
individual.
Be willing to engage and build
that trust, not take an
offensive.
But I haven't seen a
negotiation.
That's the problem.
I haven't seen that.
>> Okay, Paul, we are going to
have to leave it there.
I really appreciate your time.
Thank you for your insights on
this one.
>> Thank you very much.
>> These days, anger and
aggressiveness online seem to
feel louder, sharper and harder
to escape than ever.
And then there are those who
seem set on triggering those
strong reactions.
So what is rage bait and why is
it so effective?
Claire Weisner is a graduate of
the University of British
Columbia Okanagan, who led a
study on rage bait as part of
her master's thesis.
And she joins us from Edmonton.
How are you doing?
>> I'm doing well.
How about you?
>> I am doing great.
Let's talk about anger first
with this study.
I guess the first question is
why?
Why did you want to look into
this?
>> Yeah.
So actually in 2020, when Elon
Musk took over what's formerly
Twitter now X, a lot of people
were giving him a really hard
time online.
And he responded a lot of the
time with a laughing, crying
emoji.
So much so that people started
pointing it out.
I read an article like a blog
article pointing out how much
he's been using it in comparison
to other emojis.
If you look up Elon Musk
laughing crying emoji, you'll
get like tons and tons of news
articles about how he's
responded to some sort of
controversy with this emoji.
And I was just really curious,
because that's not what I would
immediately think of as an angry
response.
That's a laughing, crying emoji.
Not like GR, right?
So I was really curious, how are
we expressing, how are we
interpreting anger in this new
space of online like online
spaces in digital landscapes?
>> I didn't even know that.
And I'm trying to think of the
last kind of post that I or
comment that I had, and it was
exactly a laugh and then a
rolling smile.
So now I need to rethink that as
well.
Help us understand, you know,
many of us and as a journalist
as well, many of us have
experienced posting something we
think is innocent online or
something that's informative and
suddenly finding, let's say,
unexpected angry reactions help
us understand.
Do people tend to act or react
more angrily online than they
would perhaps in real life?
>> So yeah.
So anger is a high arousal
emotion, which means that it's
one of the emotions that we're
more incentivised to act upon.
So even if you have 100 eyes on
your post, 25 people are like,
cool, that's that's great.
25 people are like, oh, that
bums me out.
And then 50 people are like, oh,
I'm.
Those 50 people are more likely
than those other 50 people to
comment or engage or share or
talk about it.
Just because it's that high
arousal emotion means that they
want to act.
>> Now, help us understand the
the digital environment itself.
What factors in the environment
contribute to these angry
reactions?
I'm assuming when we talk about
angry comments, angry reactions,
I'm thinking right off the bat
all caps kind of screaming and
yelling, but we know it's as
subtle as something, even in
text messages, as putting a
period at the end of a sentence.
That might just be a
generational thing.
For some people, it could be the
emojis.
But what are the factors in the
digital environment that allow
for this to to kind of fester?
>> Yeah.
So one of the main things is
actually the platform that it's
on.
So you already touched on that.
So in interpersonal
communication, in that texting
environment it's more likely to
be what we call cold anger,
where you're a little bit more
invested in controlling your
image, coming across as very
calm collected and then also
like TikTok is more likely to be
supportive.
That's one of the only places
that I actually found.
When I expected angry comments,
I found a lot of people changing
the narrative, actively deciding
to be supportive.
And then there's anecdotal
evidence that says that
Instagram is more likely to be
angry.
You're more likely to get long
blog posts based off of the
format in Reddit.
So it just again, it depends on
the environment of the actual
platform that you're on, and
then also the social norms of
that platform.
So on Instagram, it's a little
bit more common to bully each
other, whereas TikTok it's a
little bit more common to take
that step and actively be
choosing to be supportive.
>> Can you give us an example of
a story that would be kind of
viewed differently amongst some
of those platforms that you, you
had named?
>> Yeah.
So I actually did my research on
specifically posts that were
about the Canadian housing
crisis.
So one of the things is that
just the post itself was going
to probably be a different
format on Reddit.
It was often a link to an
article or a synopsis of an
article on TikTok.
It could be, for example, the
one with the support that was
just an interview on the street,
and they were like, oh, do you
own a house?
And this young woman said, yes,
I own a house.
But then there's also people
just talking about their
opinions and stuff like that.
So a little bit more.
Not as formal as Reddit, where
they're like, okay, like these
are the facts.
Like these are the news articles
that we're going to be talking
about, you know, try and keep it
grounded, whereas TikTok is a
little bit more, you know,
loosey goosey.
We're just talking about our
opinions, how we feel.
>> All right.
Aside from how people reply to
posts, some outlets appear to do
this intentionally.
Some accounts where what is
known as rage baiting, which
was, from what I understand,
Oxford Dictionaries 2025 word of
the year.
Why not joy baiting or sad?
What is it about rage baiting?
I don't know if I just coined a
term there, but yeah, what is it
about rage baiting?
Why is it about anger?
>> Yeah, I would love joy
baiting.
Yeah.
So again, going back to that
high arousal emotion, it's just
going to make more money.
So we're more likely to get
those clicks, those shares,
those comments, people actually
talking about it.
We there.
The literature suggests that
especially compared to Joy
specifically, we're much more
likely to engage in that active
way with anger than we are with
joy.
So it's just at the end of the
day, it's the bottom line.
What's making us the most money,
especially like in an era of
like influencers, where what the
money that you make depends
quite literally on how much
engagement you're getting on
your post.
It can be very effective to
upset people and get them to
engage with you on that level.
>> Can you give an example?
I'm thinking of joy baiting.
I'm thinking of cats, I love
cats, I have a cat at home
thinking of these cute videos
and then rage baiting.
What?
Give me some examples of what
people might be used to seeing
when it's when when we consider
something as rage baiting.
>> Yeah, a lot of the rage bait
that I encountered was about
immigration, because, again,
that Canadian housing crisis.
And so just broad statements
that aren't necessarily grounded
in reality about immigration and
politics, just really, really
broad statements that can kind
of make anyone angry.
It doesn't necessarily matter
where you land on the political
spectrum just because it's, you
know, not necessarily grounded
in fact, but it is a very, very
emotional subject and it often
is a little bit offensive.
>> Well, let's talk about let's
use immigration as an example.
You know, something that, as you
said, kind of grew online.
But we did see protests, you
know, on both sides of the coin
on that conversation across the
country, are we increasingly
exposed to hot anger online?
And what impact does that have?
Sort of in our real world?
I think a lot of us think that
it is kind of protected, sort of
on the, on the.com.
But there is are we seeing
spill-over?
>> Yeah.
So we like you said, we're a
little bit we feel a little bit
protected.
It's called like a social
isolation idea where we can't
see the other person on the
screen.
So they kind of stop being real.
And the consequences are we
don't think of them.
So whereas in person, I might be
less likely to scream and yell
at someone who disagrees with
me.
I'm more likely to do that
online just because the
consequences of how they
perceive me, of my, you know,
social standing is aren't in
peril from this engagement.
I do think that we are a little
bit seeing spill-over, but there
is still those social mores that
inhibit us from behaving poorly
in person in a way that we don't
see in online spaces.
So a lot of people will like,
talk about like in these online
spaces.
I, I thought that this was
really normal.
And then I came out of it and it
like and I talked to real people
and you know, it's a lot more
nuanced than maybe I'd initially
thought.
>> With that being said, are we
becoming an angrier society?
>> I couldn't say that's
definitely a little bit out of
the scope of my research, but
definitely we are becoming more
comfortable with being
aggressive with each other in
online spaces specifically.
>> All right.
My last question to you is, you
know, for someone for a lot of
people who are on their phones
probably watching this segment
on their phones as well, what
advice would you give to
ordinary folks who are feeling
the weight of online anger on a
daily basis?
What can we do?
>> Yeah, definitely.
Number one, step back.
Try and remember that the person
on the other end is also a
person.
That's something that I always
have to remind myself that
they're not necessarily doing
this with the intention of
hurting me.
They just aren't thinking about
me as a person.
They're thinking about me as
this, you know, empty canvas of
internet.
And also just remember who's
profiting off of what you are,
what makes you angry.
So if you see something and it
really, really upsets you, who
makes money off of that?
And if it's if you can identify
that, then maybe it's not worth
engaging with.
>> All right, Claire, really
appreciate your insights.
Thank you so much.
And yeah, let's maybe we'll
watch.
My phone's been listening, so
I'll get lots of cat videos I'm
hoping outside of this.
So appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
>> Thank you so much.
Have a good day.
>> I'm Jeyan thanks for watching
