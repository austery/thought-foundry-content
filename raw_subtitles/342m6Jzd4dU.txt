From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Tuesday,
 January
 5th.
 Here's
 what
 we're


covering.


[Music]


The
 continuing
 uproar
 over
 the
 US's


attack
 on
 Venezuela
 and
 its
 capture
 of


Nicholas
 Maduro
 played
 out
 in
 four
 key


moments
 yesterday.
 First,
 at
 an


emergency
 meeting
 of
 the
 United
 Nations


Security
 Council.


This
 is
 the
 Western
 Hemisphere.
 This
 is


where
 we
 live.
 And
 we're
 not
 going
 to


allow
 the
 Western
 Hemisphere
 to
 be
 used


as
 a
 base
 of
 operation
 for
 our
 nation's


adversaries.
 And


>> there
 the
 US
 defended
 its
 actions
 in


Venezuela,
 but
 faced
 a
 wave
 of
 criticism


from
 some
 of
 its
 staunch
 allies,


including
 Brazil,
 Mexico,
 and
 France.


They
 said
 the
 military
 operation
 to


seize
 Maduro
 was
 a
 violation
 of


international
 law.
 And
 a
 top
 French


diplomat
 said
 the
 US
 had
 chipped
 away
 at


the
 quote
 very
 foundation
 of


international
 order.


Next,
 in
 Venezuela,


[Applause]


there
 was
 a
 fiery
 meeting
 of
 the


country's
 National
 Assembly
 where


lawmakers,
 including
 Maduro's
 son,


called
 for
 his
 release,
 and
 Deli


Rodriguez,
 the
 interim
 president
 of
 the


country,
 blasted
 what
 she
 called
 an


illegitimate
 military
 aggression,
 taking


a
 hostile
 tone
 toward
 the
 US,
 even
 as


she
 has
 called
 for
 peaceful
 coexistence.


The
 defiant
 tone
 of
 the
 meeting


underscored
 the
 fact
 that
 even
 with


Maduro
 in
 detention
 in
 the
 US,
 his


loyalists
 still
 have
 a
 tight
 grip
 on


power
 in
 Venezuela.


Then
 at
 almost
 exactly
 the
 same
 time
 in


a
 courthouse
 in
 Manhattan,
 Maduro


himself
 made
 his
 first
 appearance
 in


front
 of
 a
 judge,
 entering
 a
 plea
 of
 not


guilty
 to
 narotism
 and
 other
 charges
 and


saying
 that
 he
 had
 been
 kidnapped
 by
 the


American
 government.
 He
 said
 he
 was
 not


a
 common
 criminal
 defendant,
 but
 a


prisoner
 of
 war.


>> Outside
 the
 courthouse,
 crowds
 gathered


both
 to
 protest
 the
 US's
 actions
 with


chants
 of
 no
 blood
 for
 oil,
 hands
 off


Venezuelan
 soil,
 but
 also
 to
 celebrate


Maduro's
 capture.
 The
 Times
 spoke
 with


Venezuelan
 dissident
 in
 the
 crowd
 who


said
 they'd
 been
 persecuted
 by
 the


Maduro
 regime
 and
 others
 who
 said
 that


they
 hoped
 his
 removal
 would
 be
 a
 new


beginning
 for
 Venezuela.


>> I
 understand
 that
 uh
 so
 many
 people


doesn't
 agree
 because
 it
 it
 looks
 crazy


what
 happened,
 but
 for
 us
 that
 been


suffering
 so
 many
 years
 uh
 I
 I
 just
 tell


you
 you
 never
 even
 know
 what
 we
 already


live
 with
 this
 situation.


[Music]


And
 lastly,
 in
 Washington,


>> we
 have
 the
 United
 States
 military


stationed
 outside
 the
 country.
 We
 set


the
 terms
 and
 conditions.
 We
 have
 a


complete
 embargo
 on
 all
 of
 their
 oil
 and


their
 ability
 to
 do
 commerce.
 So,
 the


United
 States
 is
 in
 charge.


>> The
 administration
 has
 been
 doubling


down
 on
 its
 insistence
 that
 it
 now


controls
 Venezuela.
 Steven
 Miller,
 one


of
 President
 Trump's
 top
 policy


adviserss,
 went
 on
 CNN
 to
 explain
 their


approach.
 He
 was
 quickly
 met
 with
 sharp


criticism
 from
 Senator
 Bernie
 Sanders.


>> Mr.
 Miller
 gave
 a
 very
 good
 definition


of
 imperialism.
 And
 that's
 not
 new.
 I


mean,
 England
 did
 it,
 France
 did
 it,
 the


United
 States
 has
 done
 it.
 We
 are


powerful.
 We
 have
 the
 strongest
 military


on
 Earth.
 We
 can
 run
 any
 country
 we


want.
 Is
 that
 really
 the
 kind
 of
 America


that
 our
 people
 want?
 I
 don't
 think
 so.


The
 Senate
 is
 expected
 to
 hold
 a
 vote


later
 this
 week
 on
 a
 resolution
 that


would
 force
 President
 Trump
 to
 get


Congress's
 permission
 to
 continue
 any


military
 operations
 in
 Venezuela.
 So


far,
 Republican
 lawmakers
 have
 largely


backed
 the
 administration,
 while
 some


Democrats
 have
 questioned
 whether
 the


raid
 to
 capture
 Maduro
 was
 legal.


[Music]


Now,
 two
 more
 quick
 updates
 on
 the
 Trump


administration.
 the
 United
 States
 should


have
 Greenland
 as
 part
 of
 the
 United


States.


>> In
 his
 interview
 on
 CNN,
 Steven
 Miller


also
 declared
 that
 Greenland
 rightfully


belongs
 to
 the
 US
 and
 that
 the
 Trump


administration
 could
 seize
 it
 from


Denmark
 if
 it
 wanted
 to.


>> We
 live
 in
 a
 world
 in
 the
 real
 world


that
 is
 governed
 by
 strength,
 that
 is


governed
 by
 force,
 that
 is
 governed
 by


power.
 These
 are


>> the
 comments
 reflect
 Miller's
 vision
 for


a
 world
 order
 in
 which
 the
 US
 can


overthrow
 other
 countries
 and
 take


territory
 if
 the
 government
 says
 it's
 in


the
 national
 interest.
 If
 the
 US
 does


act
 on
 Greenland,
 it
 would
 essentially


rip
 NATO
 apart.
 Denmark
 and
 the
 US
 are


both
 founding
 members
 of
 the
 military


alliance
 where
 countries
 pledged
 to


defend
 each
 other
 against
 attack.


Denmark's
 prime
 minister
 said
 yesterday


that
 Trump's
 threats
 to
 seize
 Greenland


should
 be
 taken
 seriously.


[Music]


And
 in
 one
 of
 Health
 Secretary
 Robert
 F.


Kennedy
 Jr.'s
 most
 significant
 changes


yet,
 the
 CDC's
 list
 of
 recommended


vaccines
 for
 children
 has
 been


drastically
 scaled
 back.
 There
 were
 17


routine
 shots
 recommended
 for
 kids.
 Now


there
 are
 11.
 Federal
 officials


announced
 yesterday
 that
 they
 no
 longer


suggest
 all
 children
 get
 immunized


against
 hepatitis
 A
 and
 B,
 the
 flu,
 or


RSV,
 which
 is
 the
 leading
 cause
 of


hospitalization
 for
 infants
 in
 the
 US.


Kennedy,
 who's
 been
 a
 longtime
 vaccine


skeptic,
 said
 the
 move
 quote,
 protects


children,
 respects
 families,
 and


rebuilds
 trust
 in
 public
 health.
 The


updated
 guidance
 isn't
 expected
 to


immediately
 affect
 families
 access
 to


the
 shots,
 but
 public
 health
 experts


expressed
 outrage,
 saying
 federal


officials
 did
 not
 present
 evidence
 to


support
 the
 changes
 or
 incorporate
 input


from
 vaccine
 experts.


[Music]


>> Been
 an
 honor
 and
 a
 privilege
 to
 serve


Georgia's
 14th
 district
 as
 their


representative.
 Effective
 midnight
 last


night,
 the
 hard-right
 Republican


Marjorie
 Taylor
 Green
 has
 resigned
 from


office.
 She
 abruptly
 announced
 that
 she


was
 leaving
 late
 last
 year
 after


publicly
 breaking
 with
 President
 Trump.


The
 two
 went
 from
 close
 allies
 to


repeatedly
 clashing
 over
 the
 last
 year,


most
 notably
 over
 her
 push
 to
 get
 the


Epstein
 files
 released.
 Trump
 branded


her
 Marjgery
 Trader
 Green.
 as
 she
 leaves


Washington
 swearing
 that
 she's
 done
 with


politics.
 My
 colleague
 Robert
 Draper


says
 her
 legacy
 in
 Congress
 isn't
 a


legislative
 one.
 It's
 not
 about
 any


bills
 she
 championed.
 It's
 about
 how
 she


used
 the
 political
 spotlight.


>> What
 I
 am
 doing
 is
 sounding
 the
 alarm


bells.
 This
 is
 a
 major
 crisis
 in


America.
 She
 really
 more
 than
 almost
 any


legislator
 before
 her
 understood
 that
 in


Congress
 all
 the
 world's
 a
 stage
 and


that
 you
 could
 seize
 people's
 attention.


You
 could
 increase
 your
 own
 audience.


You
 could
 amass
 online
 donations
 by


doing
 outrageous
 things
 on
 camera.


>> Are
 your
 feelings
 hurt?
 her
 words
 down
 a


>> both
 in
 committee
 hearings
 and
 for
 that


matter
 at
 the
 State
 of
 the
 Union
 address


where
 in
 2022
 she
 famously
 heckled


President
 Biden.


>> I'll
 give
 you
 a
 copy
 of
 the
 proposal.


>> I
 spoke
 to
 Green
 at
 length
 and
 in
 a


nutshell
 her
 reason
 for
 leaving
 Congress


broke
 down
 into
 two
 categories.
 First,


that
 Congress
 had
 become
 even
 more
 of
 a


do
 nothing
 branch
 of
 government
 than
 it


had
 in
 the
 past.
 And
 secondly,
 because


she
 felt
 that
 the
 leader
 of
 her
 party,


President
 Trump,
 had
 strayed
 from
 the


America
 first
 principles
 that
 brought


her
 to
 Congress
 to
 begin
 with.
 I
 think


that
 among
 other
 things,
 it
 shows
 that


there
 is
 a
 real
 fracture
 developing


slowly
 but
 surely
 in
 the
 MAGA
 movement


where
 a
 few,
 not
 many,
 but
 a
 few
 leaders


of
 that
 movement
 are
 calling
 into


question
 its
 godfather.


[Music]


And
 finally,
 Eva
 Schllo,
 a
 Holocaust


survivor
 and
 the
 stepsister
 of
 Anne


Frank,
 has
 died
 at
 96.
 Growing
 up,
 her


family
 fled
 Vienna,
 then
 Brussels,
 ahead


of
 the
 Nazis,
 before
 they
 landed
 in


Amsterdam,
 where
 they
 became
 neighbors


with
 the
 Franks.
 When
 both
 Eva
 and
 Anne


were
 barely
 teenagers,
 their
 families


went
 into
 hiding.
 Anne
 famously
 detailed


that
 time
 in
 her
 diary.
 After
 roughly


two
 years
 of
 staying
 hidden
 away,
 both


families
 were
 discovered
 by
 the
 Gustapo.


Anne
 died
 at
 the
 Bergen
 Bellson


concentration
 camp.
 Eva
 was
 later
 freed


from
 Awitz.
 And
 Anne's
 father,
 who
 was


the
 only
 surviving
 member
 of
 the
 Frank


family,
 went
 on
 to
 marry
 Eva's
 mother.


For
 more
 than
 40
 years,
 Eva
 didn't
 talk


about
 the
 horrors
 that
 she'd
 endured


during
 the
 war.
 When
 her
 grandkids
 asked


her
 about
 the
 tattoo
 on
 her
 arm,
 she


told
 them
 it
 was
 a
 phone
 number.


>> I
 was
 a
 very
 shy
 person,
 never
 spoken


about
 my
 experience,
 and
 suddenly
 there


were
 200
 people
 looking
 at
 me.


>> But
 at
 the
 opening
 of
 an
 exhibit
 about


Ann's
 life
 in
 the
 1980s,
 Eva
 began
 to


tell
 her
 own
 story
 publicly.


>> Then
 eventually
 the
 floodgates
 opened


and
 I
 couldn't
 stop
 anymore.
 She
 went
 on


to
 travel
 all
 across
 the
 world
 to
 speak


about
 the
 dangers
 of
 injustice,


particularly
 to
 young
 people.
 In
 2019,


when
 she
 heard
 about
 a
 group
 of
 students


in
 California
 who'd
 been
 photographed


giving
 a
 Nazi
 salute,
 she
 went
 to
 meet


with
 them
 personally,
 saying
 afterwards,


"I
 think
 they
 really
 didn't
 think
 about


the
 consequences,
 but
 I
 think
 they
 have


learned
 a
 lesson
 for
 life."

 are

 headlines

 on
