Hello
 my
 friends.
 Today
 is
 February
 28th


and
 this
 is
 Markets
 Weekly.
 So
 this


morning
 we
 woke
 up
 to
 war
 in
 the
 Middle


East.
 Last
 evening,
 Israel
 and
 the


United
 States
 began
 their
 assault
 on


Iran.
 And
 as
 we
 record,
 Iran
 is


retaliating
 and
 the
 fighting
 is
 ongoing.


So
 today,
 first
 let's
 talk
 about
 what's


happening
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 and
 look
 at


prior
 Gulf
 Wars
 to
 see
 what
 that
 could


mean
 for
 markets.
 And
 secondly,
 we
 have


to
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 Catrini's


viral
 piece
 on
 AI
 displacement
 and
 note


some
 counterpoints
 as
 well.
 All
 right,


starting
 with
 the
 Middle
 East.


So
 this
 morning,
 the
 president
 released


an
 8-minute
 recorded
 video
 uh
 basically


stating
 out
 his
 rationale
 for
 war
 with


Iran
 and
 his
 goals.
 He
 noted
 that
 Iran


is
 a
 bad
 regime.
 in
 the
 past
 has


attacked
 the
 United
 States,
 taken
 their


uh
 attacked
 US
 embassy,
 taken
 hostages,


also
 could
 have
 ballistic
 missiles
 that


could
 reach
 the
 US,
 could
 potentially


have
 nuclear
 weapons,
 a
 great
 threat
 to


the
 US.
 And
 so
 what
 they're
 doing
 is


that
 they
 are
 attacking
 their


capabilities
 and
 also
 pushing
 for
 regime


change.


>> Finally,
 to
 the
 great
 proud
 people
 of


Iran,
 I
 say
 tonight
 that
 the
 hour
 of


your
 freedom
 is
 at
 hand.
 Stay
 sheltered.


Don't
 leave
 your
 home.
 It's
 very


dangerous
 outside.
 Bombs
 will
 be


dropping
 everywhere.
 When
 we
 are


finished,
 take
 over
 your
 government.
 It


will
 be
 yours
 to
 take.
 This
 will
 be


probably
 your
 only
 chance
 for


generations.
 For
 many
 years,
 you
 have


asked
 for
 America's
 help,
 but
 you
 never


got
 it.
 No
 president
 was
 willing
 to
 do


what
 I
 am
 willing
 to
 do
 tonight.
 Now,


you
 have
 a
 president
 who
 is
 giving
 you


what
 you
 want.
 So,
 let's
 see
 how
 you


respond.
 America
 is
 backing
 you
 with


overwhelming
 strength
 and
 devastating


force.
 Now
 is
 the
 time
 to
 seize
 control


of
 your
 destiny
 and
 to
 unleash
 the


prosperous
 and
 glorious
 future
 that
 is


close
 within
 your
 reach.
 This
 is
 the


moment
 for
 action.
 Do
 not
 let
 it
 pass.


>> So
 this
 is
 the
 absolute
 maximus
 position


the
 US
 could
 have
 taken.
 Now
 this
 should


not
 be
 a
 surprise
 to
 any
 of
 you.
 We've


seen
 the
 US
 build
 up
 military
 forces


over
 the
 past
 few
 weeks.
 The
 USS
 Gerald


Ford,
 the
 largest
 aircraft
 carrier
 in


the
 world,
 went
 into
 position
 on
 Friday.


And
 if
 you
 understand
 the
 US's
 political


structure,
 you
 can
 see
 that
 this
 was


definitely
 going
 to
 happen.


Now,
 the
 president's
 excuses
 are
 very


obviously
 nonsense.
 Now,
 Iran
 did
 attack


the
 US
 embassy
 that
 happened
 in
 1979.


So,
 quite
 a
 way
 back.
 And
 then,
 you


know,
 if
 you're
 reaching
 that
 far
 back


to
 find
 excuses
 to
 attack
 someone,
 you


are
 just
 kind
 of
 making
 it
 up.
 Iran
 does


have
 ballistic
 missiles,
 hypersonic


ballistic
 missiles
 that
 are
 a
 great


threat
 to
 people
 in
 the
 region
 um
 but


not
 a
 threat
 to
 the
 US.
 Uh
 on
 Friday,
 uh


the
 New
 York
 Times
 released
 a
 piece


where
 people
 in
 the
 intelligence


community
 basically
 said
 that
 uh
 that
 is


just
 not
 what
 the
 person
 said
 was
 just


not
 true.
 Now,
 with
 respect
 to
 Iran's


capacity
 to
 have
 a
 nuclear
 weapon,
 US


intelligence
 also
 suggests
 that
 they


don't
 and
 are
 not
 close
 to
 having
 a


nuclear
 weapon.
 But
 I'd
 also
 show
 you


this.
 If
 not
 stopped,
 Iran
 could
 produce


a
 nuclear
 weapon
 in
 a
 very
 short
 time.


It
 could
 be
 a
 year.
 It
 could
 be
 within
 a


few
 months.


>> They
 have
 the
 wherewithal,
 the
 stored


up,
 preserved
 knowledge
 to
 make
 a
 bomb


very
 quickly
 uh
 if
 they
 wanted
 to
 do
 it.


>> Iran
 is
 so
 dangerous,
 weeks
 away
 from


having
 the
 file
 material
 for
 an
 entire


arsenal
 of
 nuclear
 bombs.


>> They're
 very
 close.
 They're
 6
 months


away
 from
 being
 about
 90%
 of
 having
 the


rich
 uranium
 for
 an
 atom
 bomb.


>> Iran
 is
 gearing
 up
 to
 have
 to
 produce
 25


bombs,
 atomic
 bombs
 a
 year,
 250
 bombs
 in


a
 decade.


>> Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 time
 is
 running


out.


>> Iran
 will
 be
 capable
 of
 producing
 alone


without
 importing
 anything
 nuclear
 bombs


within
 3
 to
 5
 years.


So
 as
 you
 can
 see
 uh
 Prime
 Minister


Benjamin
 Natanyahu
 of
 Israel
 has
 been


saying
 for
 uh
 30
 years
 that
 Iran
 is


about
 to
 have
 an
 nuclear
 weapon


imminently
 and
 so
 we
 need
 to
 attack


them.
 So
 Iran
 is
 what
 is
 who
 Israel


perceives
 to
 be
 their
 greatest
 regional


threat
 and
 if
 you
 are
 an
 Israel
 with


dreams
 of
 having
 more
 influence
 in
 the


Middle
 East
 you
 really
 have
 to
 take
 Iran


out.
 And
 so
 they've
 been
 trying
 to
 do


this
 for
 some
 time.
 They
 cannot,
 but


maybe
 with
 the
 US's
 help,
 they
 could.


Now,
 for
 those
 of
 you
 who
 know,
 the


Israel
 lobby
 has
 tremendous
 influence
 on


foreign
 policy
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 I


can
 tell
 you
 from
 a
 personal
 example


that
 a
 few
 months
 ago,
 I
 noted
 that


Israel
 was
 killing
 tremendous
 amounts
 of


Palestinians.
 Again,
 some
 could
 call


that
 to
 be
 a
 genocide.
 Some
 could
 call


that
 to
 be
 ethnic
 cleansing,
 whatever.


And
 right
 after
 making
 that
 video,
 I
 got


all
 sorts
 of
 emails
 telling
 me
 that,
 you


know,
 that's
 not
 true,
 that's
 not
 true,


you
 know,
 and
 then
 I
 would
 point
 out,


you
 know,
 this
 is
 what
 the
 UN
 and
 the


Red
 Cross
 are
 saying,
 and
 they
 just
 turn


around
 and
 uh
 it's
 like
 talking
 to
 a


brick
 wall.
 And
 then
 I
 was
 scheduled
 at


that
 time
 to
 speak
 to
 a
 conference
 in


the
 coming
 weeks.
 And
 the
 conference


organizer
 actually
 sent
 me
 emails
 and


told
 me
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 were
 trying


to
 get
 me
 cancelled
 because
 of
 my


comments
 of
 what
 Israel
 was
 doing
 in


Gaza.
 If
 you
 if
 you
 research
 on
 the


internet,
 you'll
 notice
 that
 this
 is


actually
 very
 common.
 Uh
 people
 just


ordinary
 people
 who
 make
 comments
 about


Israeli
 actions,
 Israeli
 policy
 uh
 in
 in


Gaza
 or
 elsewhere,
 uh
 they
 get


intimidated.
 Some
 of
 them
 lose
 their


jobs.
 So
 this
 is
 something
 that
 is


actually
 quite
 widespread
 in
 the
 US.
 And


we
 are
 not
 I'm
 not
 that
 important
 and


these
 general
 white
 collar
 workers
 are


not
 that
 important
 either.
 But
 on
 but


the
 pressure
 intensifies
 when
 you
 are


actually
 in
 u
 in
 politics
 and
 congress


or
 so
 forth.
 What
 would
 happen
 actually


uh
 recently
 actually
 is
 that
 if
 you
 are


not
 supportive
 of
 Israel
 uh
 you
 would


not
 get
 donations
 from
 the
 Israeli
 pi


and
 they
 would
 actually
 fund
 your


challengers
 to
 try
 to
 take
 you
 out.
 So


there's
 tremendous
 influence
 of
 by


Israel
 on
 US
 foreign
 policy
 and
 in
 the


institutions
 in
 the
 media
 and
 so
 forth.


If
 you
 are
 not
 supportive
 of
 Israel,


they
 can
 do
 things
 to
 uh
 ruin
 your


career.
 So
 there
 is
 very
 much
 below
 the


surface
 a
 very
 strong
 pressure
 campaign


uh
 to
 support
 Israeli
 causes.
 So
 you


know
 I
 understand
 as
 President
 Trump
 was


probably
 uh
 of
 course
 under
 the
 most


intense
 pressure
 of
 his
 lifetime
 and
 it


seemed
 like
 that
 was
 enough
 to
 push
 him


to
 actually
 launch
 the
 strike
 uh
 on


Iran.


Now
 how
 this
 goes
 forward
 it's
 going
 to


be
 very
 very
 difficult
 to
 say.
 So
 first


let's
 think
 about
 what
 happened
 in
 prior


US
 middle
 eastern
 wars.
 So
 uh
 in
 1990s


there
 was
 something
 called
 operation


desert
 storm.
 At
 that
 time
 Iraq
 attacked


a
 smaller
 neighbor
 Kuwait
 and
 the


immediate
 market
 reaction
 for
 that
 was


of
 course
 huge
 huge
 spike
 in
 oil.
 At


that
 time
 the
 Middle
 East
 was
 super


crucial
 for
 oil
 and
 the
 US
 was
 a
 major


oil
 importer.
 The
 markets
 of
 course
 sold


off
 and
 did
 not
 like
 it.
 In
 the


following
 months,
 the
 US
 built
 an


international
 coalition
 aiming
 to
 uh


free
 Kuwait,
 repel
 Iraq
 and
 so
 forth.


And
 during
 that
 buildup,
 it
 was
 very


obvious,
 of
 course,
 when
 you
 move
 assets


to
 the
 Middle
 East,
 it's
 it's
 basically


in
 your
 face,
 similar
 to
 the
 buildup


we're
 seeing
 uh
 the
 past
 few
 weeks.
 And


so
 interestingly


the
 markets
 did
 poorly
 into
 the
 buildup


but
 at
 the
 moment
 the
 strikes
 commenced


oil
 totally
 totally
 imploded
 and
 the


markets
 rallied
 furiously.
 So
 it
 was
 a


very
 classic
 uh
 sell
 the
 news
 event.
 Uh


so
 it
 could
 be
 that
 the
 markets
 saw
 that


this
 would
 be
 very
 easy
 to
 win.
 It
 would


be
 something
 that
 was
 very
 brief.
 It


could
 be
 the
 markets
 had
 already


digested
 the
 um
 uh
 digested
 the
 news
 and


so
 they
 were
 selling
 off
 in
 the
 months


before
 and
 rallied
 a
 at
 the
 actual


realization
 of
 the
 event
 that
 happens


sometimes.
 Now
 another
 recent
 example
 is


in
 2003
 we
 had
 the
 Iraq
 invasion.
 So


that
 invasion
 was
 also
 something
 that


was
 very
 much
 out
 in
 the
 open.
 The
 US


built
 an
 international
 coalition
 of
 the


willing,
 launched
 tremendous
 assets
 into


Iraq
 and
 then
 uh
 invaded
 and
 overthrew


Saddam
 Hussein.
 Now
 into
 the
 buildup
 of


that
 event
 uh
 the
 markets
 did
 poorly.


Everyone
 was
 kind
 of
 worried.
 Oil
 was


spiking
 and
 equity
 markets
 selling
 off.


But
 uh
 the
 moment
 that
 attack
 began
 oil


prices
 imploded
 and
 again
 markets


rallied
 furiously
 and
 that
 was
 a
 really


very
 quick
 strike.
 In
 a
 few
 weeks
 the
 US


had
 taken
 down
 Baghdad.
 Of
 course
 the


aftermath
 took
 many
 many
 years
 but
 the


battle
 was
 over
 very
 quickly.
 So
 what


you
 see
 is
 historically
 these


geopolitical
 events
 are
 something
 that


you
 would
 fade.
 Same
 thing
 actually
 in


the
 Russia
 Ukraine
 war
 for
 example.
 Oil


spiked
 tremendously
 at
 the
 beginning
 but


again
 uh
 it's
 went
 down
 a
 lot.
 Now
 the
 I


think
 that
 is
 basically
 true.
 You


historically
 want
 to
 fade
 these


geopolitical
 events.
 Uh
 but
 I
 think


what's
 a
 little
 bit
 uncertain
 is
 that


just
 how
 this
 conflict
 would
 play
 out


because
 the
 market
 did
 not
 price
 this
 in


or
 at least
 it
 didn't
 seem
 like
 it
 was


pricing
 it
 in
 the
 equity
 markets
 largely


ignored
 it.
 Oil
 you
 do
 see
 a


geopolitical
 premium.
 It's
 not
 super


high
 but
 it
 is
 there.


So
 Iran
 is
 different
 from
 Iraq
 in
 that


uh
 for
 for
 a
 couple
 reasons.
 One
 is
 that


Iran
 is
 much
 much
 much
 bigger
 and
 also


uh
 in
 geography
 and
 in
 population.
 Also,


they
 have
 more
 sophisticated
 weapons
 and


word
 is
 that
 they
 have
 some
 assistance


from
 Russia
 and
 China,
 though
 it's
 hard


to
 know
 how
 much.
 So,
 at
 the
 moment,


what
 Iran
 seems
 to
 be
 doing
 is
 that
 they


are
 striking
 um
 oil
 facilities


or
 military
 assets,
 basically
 neighbors


in
 the
 region.
 It's
 really
 hard
 to
 know,


fog
 of
 war
 and
 all
 that,
 but
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 they
 have
 said
 they're
 doing


and
 appear
 to
 be
 doing
 is
 to
 try
 to


disrupt
 global
 oil.
 So,
 if
 that's
 the


case,
 and
 if
 Iran
 does
 have
 these


military
 assets
 that
 maybe
 we
 don't


fully
 know
 about,
 the
 ballistic


missiles,
 the
 hypersonic
 ones
 are
 are


very
 effective
 uh
 and
 cannot
 easily
 be


intercepted.
 This
 could
 be
 a
 longer
 war


than
 we
 anticipate
 and
 it
 may
 not
 be
 as


easy
 as
 um
 as
 the
 market
 well
 as
 past


military
 action
 has
 been.
 Again,
 whereas


US
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 assets
 here,
 last
 time
 I


think
 they
 had
 like
 five
 carriers,
 this


time
 there's
 only
 two.
 So
 this
 is
 very


much
 a
 high
 degree
 of
 uncertainty.
 But


what
 I
 think
 is
 pretty
 clear
 though
 is


that
 this
 will
 not
 be
 something
 that
 is


over
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 weekend.
 If
 you


really
 want
 regime
 change,
 this
 is
 going


to
 take
 days
 and
 the
 US
 seems
 to
 be


prepared
 for
 that.
 The
 president
 noted


very
 clearly
 that
 uh
 there
 will
 will
 be


casualties
 here.
 So
 he's
 prepared
 to
 do


that.


One
 limiting
 factor
 is
 that
 the
 US


actually
 doesn't
 have
 that
 many


munitions
 and
 so
 it
 really
 can't
 be
 here


for
 a
 very
 long
 period
 of
 time
 in
 the


matter
 of
 weeks.
 It
 could
 eventually
 run


out
 of
 munitions
 and
 as
 I
 understand


those
 are
 not
 easily
 replenished.
 So


this
 is
 not
 something
 that's
 necessarily


going
 to
 take
 months
 but
 it
 could
 take


weeks.
 So
 uh
 this
 is
 something
 that


first
 and
 foremost
 is
 going
 to
 be


destabilizing.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big


riskoff
 day,
 but
 I
 expect
 that


eventually
 this
 is
 something
 that
 uh


would
 be
 worth
 fading.


Now,
 the
 most
 direct
 impact
 that
 this


would
 have
 on
 the
 US
 economy
 is
 through


oil
 prices,
 of
 course.
 Now,
 recall


though
 that
 US
 is
 actually
 the
 largest


oil
 uh
 producer
 in
 the
 world
 today.
 So,


it's
 not
 going
 to
 have
 as
 much
 of
 an


impact
 on
 US
 as
 it
 would
 in
 the
 past.


But
 that's
 not
 true
 for
 other
 countries.


Think
 about
 Japan.
 I
 think
 about
 Europe


for
 example.
 So
 that's
 going
 to
 have
 a


much
 bigger
 impact
 on
 them
 uh
 than
 um


than
 the
 US.


More
 broadly
 looking
 out,
 this
 is
 going


to
 have
 an
 important
 implications
 on
 the


political
 prospects
 of
 the
 Republicans


uh
 in
 the
 midterms.
 They're
 going
 to


lose
 the
 House.
 There
 is
 some


probability
 that
 they
 could
 lose
 the


Senate
 as
 well.
 So
 losing
 all
 of


Congress
 uh
 would
 be
 a
 very
 big
 blow
 to


the
 president's
 agenda.
 It
 opens
 up
 all


sorts
 of
 investigations
 on
 the
 president


and
 his
 cabinet
 members
 and
 you
 know


maybe
 some
 of
 them
 would
 might
 possibly


go
 to
 jail.
 So
 if
 you're
 banking
 on


having
 a
 America
 first
 agenda
 or
 maybe


further
 deregulation
 and
 all
 that
 other


stuff
 that
 becomes
 much
 more
 difficult


should
 the
 president
 lose
 Congress.


Looking
 beyond
 that
 it
 also
 impacts
 JD


Vance's
 um
 chances
 for
 presidency
 as


well.
 a
 big
 constituency
 in
 the


Republican
 party
 is
 against
 war
 and
 they


basically
 broke
 all
 their
 promises
 and


so
 this
 is
 something
 that
 that
 uh
 makes


it
 much
 more
 likely
 that
 they
 would
 lose


the
 2028
 election
 and
 of
 course
 uh
 if
 we


have
 a
 Democratic
 party
 there
 that


suggests
 significant
 changes
 in
 things


like
 tax
 policy
 and
 immigration
 policy


as
 well.
 So
 this
 is
 something
 that
 we


should
 definitely
 focus
 on.
 It's
 um
 very


unfortunate
 to
 have
 this
 war
 and
 so
 um


but
 again
 it's
 it's
 early
 so
 let's
 see


how
 this
 plays
 out.
 All
 right,
 the


second
 thing
 that
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about


is
 of
 course
 the
 huge
 viral
 piece
 had
 on


AI
 sketching
 out
 a
 potential
 uh
 kind
 of


a
 doomsday
 scenario
 where
 AI
 massively


massively
 displace
 white
 collar
 workers


uh
 leads
 to
 tremendous
 rise
 in
 the


unemployment
 rate
 uh
 maybe
 deflation


maybe
 it
 impacts
 a
 lot
 of
 um
 mortgages


loans
 and
 so
 forth
 and
 we'll
 also
 talk
 a


little
 bit
 about
 uh
 some
 counter


examples
 to
 this.
 So
 the
 scenario
 that


Centruni
 sketches
 is
 something
 that
 I


think
 we've
 talked
 about
 before
 and
 we


can
 kind
 of
 see
 happening
 today.
 So
 this


past
 week,
 uh,
 Jack
 Dorsey
 of
 Block


fired
 4,000
 out
 of
 his
 10,000
 employees,


saying
 that
 AI
 basically
 has
 made
 a
 lot


of
 them
 unnecessary.
 Now,
 the
 naysayers


will
 say
 that
 Jack
 Dorsey
 overhired
 and


he's
 trying
 using
 AI
 as
 an
 excuse
 to


shrink
 headcount.
 I
 think
 that


definitely
 plays
 a
 role
 as
 well.
 But
 the


ultimate
 question
 is
 is
 agentic
 AI
 as
 it


is
 today
 capable
 of
 replacing
 some
 white


collar
 workers.
 Now
 after
 having
 using


anthropic
 and
 listening
 to
 wider


perspectives
 I
 think
 that
 is
 definitely


true.


Now
 Sutrini's
 example
 takes
 that
 and


takes
 it
 a
 step
 further
 and
 notes
 that


you
 know
 maybe
 there's
 much
 more


widespread
 uh
 displacement
 and
 what


happens
 to
 these
 white
 collar
 workers?


Well,
 they
 all
 tumble
 into
 blueco
 collar


jobs
 like
 uh
 driving
 Uber
 until
 we
 get


autonomous
 driving
 of
 course
 compressing


wages
 for
 blue
 collar
 workers
 and
 in


sense
 we
 get
 into
 this
 huge
 u
 kind
 of
 a


deflationary
 spiral
 and
 in
 that
 scenario


of
 course
 in
 my
 personal
 view
 bonds


would
 be
 the
 ultimate
 AI
 trade.


Now
 a
 counterpoint
 to
 that
 of
 course


would
 be
 uh
 looking
 past
 over
 the
 past


100
 years
 200
 years
 we've
 always
 had


technical
 logical
 advancement
 right
 and


what
 we've
 seen
 after
 every
 advancement


from
 electricity
 steam
 engines
 internet


and
 so
 forth
 is
 that
 yes
 there
 is
 some


friction
 in
 the
 employment
 market
 but
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 there's
 no
 mass


spread
 unemployment
 right
 people
 find


new
 jobs
 you
 know
 people
 become
 I
 don't


know
 YouTubers
 or
 something
 like
 that


and
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 we
 are
 all


wealthier
 here.
 So
 that
 is
 of
 course
 a


very
 obvious
 historical
 observation.
 Now


one
 thing
 I'll
 note
 though
 is
 that
 I


think
 that's
 not
 fully
 true.
 So
 one
 is


that
 over
 the
 past
 few
 decades
 we


actually
 do
 see
 mass
 unemployment
 but


it's
 just
 not
 measured
 and
 let
 me


explain.
 So
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we


saw
 partially
 through
 globalization
 and


partially
 through
 increased
 automation


in
 manufacturing
 was
 that
 you
 the
 US
 has


much
 fewer
 manufacturing
 jobs.
 Now
 that


doesn't
 necessarily
 show
 up
 in
 the


higher
 unemployment
 rate
 because
 what


happened
 actually
 is
 that
 hundreds
 uh


thousands
 millions
 of
 of
 people


basically
 dropped
 out
 of
 the
 labor


force.
 So
 they're
 not
 counted
 in
 the


unemployment
 rate.
 So
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


labor
 force
 participation
 prime
 age


among
 cohorts
 you
 can
 see
 that
 uh
 people


without
 a
 college
 degree
 people
 who


usually
 in
 the
 past
 would
 have
 worked
 in


say
 bluecollar
 manufacturing
 jobs
 their


labor
 force
 participation
 rate
 dropped


precipitously
 as
 automation
 and


globalization
 were
 going
 on
 and
 just
 has


not
 retire
 recovered.
 So
 a
 portion
 of


the
 population
 does
 get
 left
 behind


permanently.
 they
 don't
 show
 up
 in
 the


unemployment
 rate
 because
 they
 drop
 out


of
 the
 labor
 force.
 Now
 the
 second
 thing


to
 note
 is
 that
 the
 technology


definitely
 makes
 us
 all
 wealthier.


Obviously,
 let's
 say
 that
 I'm
 using
 AI


now.
 I
 can
 create
 a
 funny
 uh
 photo
 or


funny
 video
 effortlessly.
 That
 is
 goods


and
 services
 produced,
 right?
 You
 are


basically
 in
 real
 terms
 having
 uh
 more


wealth
 and
 AI
 can
 do
 a
 lot
 in
 research


and
 so
 forth.
 All
 that
 stuff
 is
 super


important.
 And
 if
 you
 were
 to
 count
 it


into
 GDP,
 more
 goods
 and
 services


produced,
 that
 is
 definitely
 going
 to


boost
 GDP.
 But
 that
 is
 not
 the
 whole


story.
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily
 boost


income
 because
 of
 massive
 deflation
 in


in
 the
 products
 produced.
 Now
 income


nominal
 income
 is
 important
 because
 a


lot
 of
 people
 uh
 will
 have
 debt
 and
 so


if
 you
 have
 massive
 massive


technological
 innovation
 that
 allows
 you


to
 produce
 goods
 and
 services
 much


cheaply.
 Yes,
 overall
 we
 are
 all


wealthier
 but
 that
 doesn't
 necessarily


mean
 you
 make
 more
 money.
 And
 if
 you


have
 fixed
 nominal
 obligations
 like
 a


mortgage
 or
 like
 corporate
 debt
 and
 so


forth,
 uh
 that
 that's
 actually
 big


trouble
 for
 you.
 So
 my
 best
 guess
 is


actually
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 AI
 will


make
 us
 all
 wealthier,
 but
 no
 one
 will


make
 any
 money.
 So
 we're
 seeing
 some
 of


that
 creep
 into
 the
 debt
 markets.
 So


what's
 kind
 of
 alarming
 is
 that
 we
 saw


some
 stress
 in
 the
 debt
 markets.
 So
 the


senior
 loan
 market
 or
 if
 you
 look
 at


private
 credit
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 BDC's
 these


are
 basically
 publicly
 traded
 credit


private
 credit
 funds
 uh
 these
 guys
 are


taking
 huge
 huge
 haircuts
 on
 their


equity
 prices
 because
 they're
 are
 big


lenders
 to
 software
 technology.
 So
 as


this
 disruption
 goes
 on
 it's
 creeping


into
 the
 debt
 markets
 it's
 creeped
 into


the
 equity
 markets.
 So
 it's
 it's
 hard
 to


say
 how
 this
 would
 play
 out.
 I
 do
 think


though
 that
 this
 can
 definitely
 uh
 re
 AI


can
 definitely
 replace
 let's
 say
 an


associate
 or
 an
 analyst.
 So
 there
 is


going
 to
 be
 structurally
 lower
 demand


for
 labor.
 Um
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 bumpy


road
 and
 the
 way
 that
 I
 think
 policy


would
 react
 to
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 more


rate
 cuts.
 Um
 just
 one
 other
 note,
 we


did
 have
 inflation
 data
 last
 week
 that


was
 higher
 than
 anticipated.
 Uh
 but


really
 that's
 kind
 of
 looking
 at
 the


rear
 view
 mirror.
 the
 disruption
 that


we're
 having
 is


just
 about
 to
 occur
 and
 it's
 not
 yet
 in


full
 force.
 Greg
 Ip
 from
 the
 Wall
 Street


Journal
 has
 a
 really
 good
 article
 on


this
 noting
 that
 actually
 software
 jobs


are
 are
 increasing.
 So
 maybe
 this
 AI


stuff
 is
 just
 doom
 and
 that
 could
 be


true
 but
 I
 think
 we
 are
 early
 in
 this


process.
 Also
 if
 you
 look
 at
 other
 more


broadly
 other
 technology
 sector
 jobs


they've
 actually
 been
 declining.
 All


right
 so
 that's
 all
 I
 prepared
 for


today.
 Thanks
 so
 much
 for
 tuning
 in.


Next
 week
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 very
 exciting


and
 volatile
 week.
 All
 right,
 talk
 to


you
 next
 week.
