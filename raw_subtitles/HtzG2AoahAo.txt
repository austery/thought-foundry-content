So it is quite traditional in my country
to walk into a room and to greet.
But not just to greet.
You're supposed
to respond back to the greeting
that I'm about to teach you.
I promise you, it's very easy.
So there are two things
that I'm going to ask of you today,
because I imagine some of you
are maybe pretty shy, OK?
So what I will say is: “Sanibona.”
And you will respond back
by saying, “Sakubona.”
Alright, are you ready?
Sanibona!
Audience: Sakubona.
KD: Thank you, that was very easy, right?
Very easy.
So in my culture,
it is considered considerably rude
to walk into a room without any greeting,
as I mentioned to you before.
What sanibona really means
is: “We see you.”
It's kind of crazy to think
that I'm saying that we see you, right,
but it's just one person,
it's just me standing here.
What it really means
is that everything that I am,
everything that I come with,
sees all the stories that come with you.
It also means that the ancestors
come with me and they, too, see you.
That’s what sanibona truly, truly means.
This is the second thing
I'm going to ask you to do today.
I promise you, it's the last thing
I'm going to ask you.
And it’s even easier
than sakubona, alright?
So I'm going to ask you
to repeat after me.
It is a tradition, you have to say this
after you say sakubona.
Are you ready?
Alright.
(Speaking in IsiXhosa)
(Laughter)
(Continues in IsiXhosa)
Your turn.
(Laughter)
Alright, that is a notoriously
difficult tongue twister
in my language of IsiXhosa.
IsiXhosa, I'm pretty sure
even that is pretty difficult to say,
the language itself.
So this is a language that I speak.
And I'm pretty sure you're saying that,
OK, great, Khaya,
what are you here to tell us?
What is the great new insight
that you're going to reveal to us today,
besides doing some breakdancing
with your tongue?
(Laughter)
To tell you the truth,
is that I'm literally just here
to have conversation
for the sake of conversation.
I'm here to tell stories
for the sake of telling stories.
There's a great South African
philosopher by the name of Steve Biko.
He wrote an amazing book called
"I Write What I Like."
And in it, he says,
Westerners are often quite surprised
by our capacity as Africans
for talking to one another
and not to talk,
because there is any particular
conclusion you want to arrive at,
but simply to have
a conversation for its sake.
And this is what I want to do today.
So I'm going to tell you three stories
for the sake of telling stories.
And I really do hope that you have
nothing to learn from these stories.
(Laughter)
The first story that I want to tell you
is when I began my career in advertising,
many, many years ago,
my cousin, who was also an advertising,
had to shoot an advert with the great
and legendary William Shatner
back in South Africa.
So William Shatner went
and flew to South Africa,
and I was an incredible fan
of "Boston Legal," his TV show.
(Laughter)
And I shared my love with my cousin,
whose name is Xolisa.
I share this love with him.
And he fell in love with the show,
and so somebody told
William Shatner that, like,
there are these young guys
who just love your show.
And so he was so moved that he conspired
to have a lunch with us
the day before he left South Africa
to go back to the United States.
And we went to this incredible, expensive,
exclusive hotel that I'd never
been to in my entire life.
And when we got to this hotel,
he was waiting for us
and he was so kind and so generous.
And he called the waiter
and he said to the waiter,
"Can I have three glasses of whiskey?
The most expensive whiskey that you have.
But before you get me those whiskeys,
if money was no object for you,
I want to ask you a question.
What kind of cigar
would you choose for yourself?"
And the young man
thought about it, and he said,
"Did you say that money is no object?"
And the young man said, the barman said,
"OK, yeah, I know what to give you."
And he gave us three cigars.
And I mean, I don't smoke cigars.
I know nothing about cigars.
But if you know anything
about "Boston Legal,"
you will know that ...
(Laughter)
At the end of every single episode,
William Shatner's character
sits with his protege,
and they have a glass of whiskey
and smoke a cigar.
And so we sat with William
Shatner and we did this.
And when we are having
amazing conversations with him,
and the most incredible thing
about William Shatner
is that, and to this day, I've never met
someone who listens like he does.
It felt like his entire body
was listening to us, his whole being.
I had never been seen
like that in my entire life.
He was so generous with his time.
And I remember looking
at my cousin, and I was thinking,
he's spending his time with us,
but also spending his money
with those expensive whiskey
and his expensive cigars.
He talked about his family,
we talked about religion,
and I didn't feel
like I was talking to a superstar,
but I felt like I was speaking
to my long lost grandfather.
And then, after two and a half hours
of having amazing conversation
with Mr. Shatner,
somebody came up to us and said,
"Mr. Shatner, we have to take you
to the airport now."
And so he got up and he said,
"Thank you so very much,
I really do appreciate
what you guys did for me."
And then he pointed
to the waiter and said to him,
"They are paying."
(Laughter)
But I felt so seen.
(Laughter)
It was priceless,
that particular experience.
And this is my second story
that I’m going to tell you.
So my second story
that I'm about to tell you
is that I grew up towards
the tail end of apartheid South Africa.
And what that meant was
that I was in the first cohort of kids,
of Black kids,
who were allowed to go to previously
white-only government schools.
In fact,
I was the only Black child in my class
when I went to this particular school.
And I have this very vivid memory
of me in junior school,
going to the library
with my new white friends.
And we get into the library,
and this profound obsession
with these other boys of astronomy,
as young boys tend to do.
And we went to the library
and spoke in hushed tones,
and were paging through
and showing off what we know
about the planetary systems.
And this one boy says to me,
when I saw a picture of this moon,
he said, "Oh, when you look at the moon,
you can see the face
of a man on the moon."
And I remember being quite
flabbergasted and thinking,
"There is no man on the moon.
What do you mean?"
And then he began to trace out
these images of what you could see.
And I saw a man on the moon
for the first time.
You see, the very difference
between him and I
is that I’d spent the first 10 years
of my life in village South Africa.
And now, when I say village,
don't imagine the idealistic
village in England.
This is the kind of village
that I'm talking about.
It is the actual village where I spent
the first 10 years of my life.
So do you know what I saw
when I was looking at images,
when I looked at the moon?
I could see a woman
carrying a bucket on her head
with a baby on her back.
I'm sure you're confused,
saying, what is this?
This is what we saw.
This is what we grew up seeing.
We saw a woman, and not a man.
A woman carrying a bucket on her head
with a baby on her back.
That's what I'd always known.
And when we sat there together --
When I was looking at these images
and I remember thinking,
this is so different from what I thought.
And both stories were so true.
And no one thought that the one
version was better than another
or more meaningful than the other.
We obviously went home,
and we shared these versions
and showed off the new thing
that we learned today.
So to bridge the gap
between two different cultures,
it is important for us
to embrace all stories.
In a world that we find ourselves in,
especially today,
when we think that our version
is the correct one,
that the only version we need to follow
is the one that we know,
we do not build a world that is great
for the bridges that we need
to create for ourselves.
And I think we understand what kind
of world we find ourselves in today.
And then, I'm sure another question
that you're wondering is like,
"Khaya, OK, we hear you,
did you really mean it when you said
that you're telling stories
for the sake of telling stories?"
Yes, I meant it.
And I said that I don't want you
to learn anything from these lessons,
but I do have a question.
And one of the questions
that I have to ask is:
When did we decide that every conversation
must be transactional?
When did we decide that every conversation
must have some hidden KPI,
and not have a conversation for its sake,
to enjoy the company of another human?
Because in reality, what we do know
is that behind every casual conversation
we'll have with anybody
is the desire for connection.
We want to connect
with another human being.
And the hardest thing about connection
is making that first step
to connect with another person.
There is this battle
against loneliness that we're fighting.
And yet we think that technology
is what's going to help us
fight against this loneliness.
But what has happened to us
is that the more time
we connect with technology,
the less we get to know our neighbors.
We know more about technology in our hands
than we do know about our neighbors.
It is as if we have created
a new commandment,
which is: “Know thy technology,
but don’t know thy neighbor.”
And so I want to tell
a very personal story now.
And I decided this as I was walking here,
that I should share this particular story.
A few short years ago,
my brother, who was
the youngest in my family,
took his own life.
And the reason he took his life
was because he had a profound
connection with a device.
And this device exploited
his addictive personality.
And his addictive
personality was gambling.
Online sports betting.
He was so ashamed
that he did not connect us
and talk to us about his problem,
that eventually he took his own life.
And I'll never forget the day
we went to his funeral.
And my mother that evening,
talking to myself and my sisters.
Almost talking to herself.
My mother said,
in my language of IsiXhosa ...
(Speaking in IsiXhosa)
Which means "I am going to die next year."
And what ...
I am happy to say that the following
year she did not die.
She was a very healthy
woman and very active.
And the year after that,
my mother did not die.
But exactly, almost exactly a year ago,
my mother passed away
from a heartbreak because she could
not longer connect
with her son.
And her words
connected to a prophecy
that made her own passing a reality.
And what I do in return
is that in order for me
to be able to connect
with my parents, with my mother,
and with my brother
is that I decided to write a book.
But it felt like I was exploiting them,
exploiting their death
in order for me to connect with them.
But it did make me feel better,
despite what I felt.
And so,
I suppose how I want to end this is --
AI is going to take over
all sorts of tasks.
And correctly so.
It's going to take over tasks,
it's going to take over
all sorts of algorithms.
But the one thing it cannot do
is take our humanity.
It cannot do that.
While AI can tell all stories
and can tell beautiful stories,
it cannot tell a story
that one heart can tell to another.
While human beings are made
for connecting with one another,
while sharing stories
for the sake of sharing stories,
while having conversations
for the sake of conversation
is not what makes us human.
What really makes us human
is the fact that we simply connect
for the sake of connecting.
Thank you.
(Applause)
