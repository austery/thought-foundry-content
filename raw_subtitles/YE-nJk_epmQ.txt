The reason why people feel Trump has fallen so short on the economy and taking care of the middle class is because of inflation. Trump said over and over again, and some people in the administration have been very publicly gaslighting in my opinion, the country saying, "Hey, inflation's not happening." Inflation is happening. If you sold people, that price would go down. We're back up to 3% inflation, folks. Not only is it not going down, it's going up. And I think when you put together what people are seeing, this focus on a big ballroom being added, focus on tariffs, things that Americans are not seeing hit their wages, and they're seeing their kids not be able to get jobs, that 9%. This is what's concerning Americans. Trump has failed the middle class.
