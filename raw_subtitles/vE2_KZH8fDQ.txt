This is me
about to perform one
of the most dangerous stunts
in cinematic history:
hanging on the side of a C-130
as it's taking off.
No goggles,
no helmet,
no parachute.
This stunt has only ever been performed
by one other person on the planet.
Tom Cruise.
(Laughter)
So I think it's fair to say
that this is the first time
this stunt has ever been attempted
by a mere mortal.
My name is Michelle Khare,
and I created a show on YouTube
called "Challenge Accepted,"
where I attempt the world's
toughest stunts and professions.
But despite my job title,
I was not born a daredevil.
I was born a child of immigrants
who sacrificed everything
to give me a safe,
secure, and a chance at a successful life.
They gave up so much for me just to exist.
So why would I ever risk that?
So growing up,
I only saw fear as a stop sign.
In seventh grade,
I was the kid who quit the cheer team
when someone else got hurt.
And my biggest rebellion in high school
was choosing to use the font Gill Sans
instead of Times New Roman
at the International Science
and Engineering Fair.
(Laughter)
And while this mindset
definitely set me up for success,
it also left me
incredibly lonely as an adult.
So I decided to take my first big risk
and sign up for something
that had absolutely nothing
to do with my career:
a cycling club.
And I was terrible.
But I kept coming back
because I had something
I had never had before:
the freedom to fail without consequence.
Now most of our learning journeys
look something like this.
In the beginning, learning
something new is really, really fun.
And our brain floods with dopamine
at any sign of progress.
Some people call this beginner's luck,
but I think it's much more than that.
Amateurs often see progress
faster than professionals
in this rapid adaptation phase.
We have the willingness to ask questions,
to look silly trying, to take risks.
So it's not luck.
I think it's an amateur's mindset.
Knowing there's only room for improvement.
And this feels great
until we hit a plateau.
Learning starts to feel like work,
we have a little bit of experience,
so we start self-judging as we try,
and many of us give up here.
But if we could find a way
to stay in that amateur's mindset,
how much further could we go?
With cycling, I had somehow found a way
to stay in that headspace
even as I got better.
And if you fast forward two years later,
I decided to go to nationals
on a whim for fun
as an average-ranked racer.
During the final event,
I decided to take a big risk
and sprint ahead of the group.
But because nobody was threatened by me,
they assumed I would burn out
and fall back in with everyone else.
But 20 minutes later,
to everyone's surprise, including my own,
I ended up winning.
(Laughter)
And it was the first time
I had seen success
or won something
by genuinely just having fun.
So I thought to myself:
How much of life had I been
missing out on because of fear?
Could a daredevil be developed?
So I wrote out all of my fears
on a whiteboard
and connected each
to a unique circumstance
that would force me to address it.
I started posting my adventures online
as a way to hold myself accountable.
To face my fear of being perceived
as unintelligent,
I studied with chess masters
until I hit 1,000 ELO.
It took me 10 months.
To face my fear of confrontation,
I trained with an Olympian
to box in front of 12,000 screaming fans.
I bloodied my teeth, I broke my nose,
but I won the match.
(Laughter)
And to face my fear
of being perceived as unfunny,
I joined a professional clowning troupe.
And, I'll be honest,
there's nothing scarier than standing
in front of a group of strangers
trying to make them laugh
while looking like this.
(Laughter)
And people really responded.
The show has amassed 850 million views.
Now fear exists for a good reason.
It's to protect us from danger.
Sometimes fear means,
hey, if you do this, you will die.
But oftentimes I have found
we take that way too far.
Fear doesn't always mean stop.
Sometimes it means go.
Here's an example.
A couple of years ago,
I became obsessed with Harry Houdini
and his deadliest trick:
the water torture cell.
Bound in chains,
locked upside down in a glass box
filled to the brim with water,
Houdini would escape with a single breath.
How could anyone be this brave?
So it became my mission
to attempt this act,
to confront my fear of drowning.
Now the average person can hold
their breath for 30 to 60 seconds.
But for this stunt,
I needed a breath hold of three minutes.
It may sound crazy,
but under the right
training and supervision
it is possible.
But to get there,
you have to push
through the struggle phase.
This is when, as carbon dioxide
builds in your bloodstream,
your brain thinks you're suffocating
and sends signals to your diaphragm
to cause violent contractions
to force you to breathe.
Now for weeks I failed at this edge,
and my breath hold times
were progressively getting worse.
Until my coach told me,
"Hey, you can't muscle through.
You have to surrender."
And when I finally
surrendered to the pain,
I started noticing all these
details I hadn't before.
I noticed I was shivering,
which meant I was burning valuable oxygen,
just trying to stay warm.
My wetsuit felt a little too tight,
so I actually wasn't able to get
a full inhale before I went in.
I started noticing
all of these little changes
that we began to make and address,
and it made all the difference.
Stripped of the emotional component,
fear is simply information.
It tells us exactly what we need
to know in order to progress.
And when we addressed all of these things,
everything changed.
Six weeks later,
I escaped Houdini's trick
in two minutes and 40 seconds.
(Applause and cheers)
This is me in front of a panel
of 20 martial arts legends
about to fail spectacularly
in front of all of them.
A black belt in taekwondo typically takes
three to five years to earn,
but I wanted to see if it
would be possible in only 90 days.
Everybody thought it was crazy,
and many people rightfully
questioned if it was even appropriate
to do something like this.
So I knew I could only progress
with the blessing of a respected master.
Enter the legendary
Grandmaster Simon Rhee.
To call this man the best of the best
actually is not an exaggeration,
because he literally starred in the movie
"The Best of the Best"
(Laughter)
And together, we did
what nobody thought was possible.
In just 90 days,
Master Rhee coached me
to pass every single belt test.
Yellow, green, blue, red.
And I was granted permission
to test for the black belt.
Now Master Rhee’s belt test
is a multi-hour gauntlet.
You have to perform hundreds of forms.
You have to spar
three black belts at once.
But for the final step,
you have to break a brick with your hand.
And after many hours of sweat,
I made it here to this final step,
the final inch to the finish line
for the black belt.
And this is what happened.
(Video) Permission to break, sir.
Master Rhee: Permission granted.
So nothing happened.
Like not even a crack.
And I failed the entire
belt test because of it.
But Master Rhee had taken a chance on me.
He put his reputation on the line
to see if this would be possible.
And I realized that giving up
on this challenge
would be worse than giving up on myself.
It would be giving up on him.
So I kept training for months
after this video released on YouTube.
And on day 264, this happened.
(Screams)
(Applause)
Failure is, as painful as it is,
a necessary part of the process.
And when we feel
disappointment and failure,
it's a privilege because it means we care.
Which brings us back here.
Moments before I attempted
the most dangerous stunt of my career.
A 10-minute flight pattern
with me tethered to the side
of this military aircraft.
This was the greatest logistical
challenge our team had ever faced,
and an amateur's mindset was crucial.
We had to be unafraid to ask questions,
to make mistakes along the way,
and be willing to ask for help.
On set, we had a "fear is welcome" policy.
This meant that at any moment,
anyone on the crew could raise a concern
and it would be addressed
in front of the whole group.
This strategy allowed us
to fine-tune every single detail,
from the custom contact lenses
I wore to protect my eyes,
to the tightness of the harness,
to even the FAA approval paperwork.
It was the only way
we could ensure, without a doubt,
we were ready for the impossible.
And with the support
of this team, weeks later,
it happened.
When I set out
to make "Challenge Accepted"
I assumed there would be
a magical moment
where I'd finally feel like a daredevil,
a woman without fear.
But that moment,
for better or for worse,
actually has never come.
But that is exactly why I do these things.
Not because I'm unafraid.
But actually because I am.
Thank you.
(Cheers and applause)
