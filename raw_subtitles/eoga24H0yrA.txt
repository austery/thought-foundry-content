>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 Odd
 Thoughts
 podcast.
 I'm
 Tracy


Aloway


>> and
 I'm
 Joe
 Weisenthal.


>> Joe,
 we
 are
 here
 in
 Chicago.


>> I
 love
 it
 here
 so
 much.
 I
 We
 don't
 come


here
 enough.


>> I
 agree.
 Chicago
 is
 an
 amazing
 city.


It's
 also
 just
 such
 an
 interesting
 city


from
 a
 financial
 perspective
 and
 it
 has


that
 old
 school,
 you
 know,
 merkantile


Midwest
 kind
 of
 feel.


>> Totally.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 it
 what's
 cool


about
 Chicago
 are
 many
 cool
 things,
 but


it
 obviously
 has
 the
 the
 history
 of


trading
 and
 pits
 and,
 you
 know,
 trading


pigs
 and
 all
 that
 stuff.
 And
 it's
 still


a
 city
 that's
 at
 the
 cutting
 edge
 of


trading.
 And
 so
 it's
 pretty
 cool
 that


like
 the
 history
 is
 like
 not
 just


history,
 it's
 still
 when
 I
 think
 of


capital
 T
 trading,
 I
 usually
 think
 of


Chicago.


>> Absolutely.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 themes
 for


our
 trip
 to
 Chicago
 this
 time
 is
 trading


and
 the
 evolution
 of
 trading
 and
 also


the
 retail
 revolution
 that
 we're
 seeing.


And
 on
 that
 note,
 we
 have
 some
 very


interesting
 partnerships
 that
 have
 been


developing
 between,
 I
 guess,
 old
 school


exchanges
 and
 more,
 let's
 just
 say,
 more


retail
 oriented
 platforms.
 So
 I
 think


there's
 the
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 think
 is


really
 interesting
 that's
 going
 on
 in
 uh


financial
 markets
 among
 many
 other


things
 is
 it
 seems
 like
 there's
 two


different
 entities
 that
 are
 trying
 to


cannibalize
 each
 other.
 And
 what
 the
 way


I
 think
 about
 it
 is
 you
 have
 these
 sort


of
 legacy
 well
 you
 have
 essentially


these
 sort
 of
 maybe
 like
 gambling


oriented
 entities
 or
 what
 people
 think


of
 as
 speculating
 wanting
 to
 look
 more


like
 legacy
 financial
 institutions
 and


you
 have
 legacy
 financial
 institutions


that
 want
 to
 subsume
 the
 sort
 of


high-speed
 trading
 speculative
 gambling


impulse
 of
 many
 young
 retail
 traders
 and


it's
 like
 which
 one
 will
 swallow
 the


other
 will
 it
 be
 that
 I
 trade
 on
 my


sports
 app
 Well,
 is
 it
 will
 will
 I
 be


trading
 cotton
 futures
 on
 my
 sports
 app


or
 will
 the
 uh
 the
 opposite
 will
 I
 be


going
 to
 a
 traditional
 brokerage
 to


place
 bets
 on
 a
 Raiders
 game?


>> That's
 a
 great
 way
 of
 putting
 it.
 I
 also


have
 to
 say
 there's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an


irony
 here
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 old


school
 exchanges
 used
 to
 be
 criticized


for
 enabling
 gambling
 in
 derivatives


contracts,
 right?
 And
 now
 and
 now
 are


considering
 sports
 betting.
 Doors
 are


all
 flung
 open.
 It's
 it's
 all
 very


confusing,
 but
 I
 have
 to
 say
 we
 have
 the


perfect
 guest
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 cutting


edge
 of
 trading
 and
 the
 retail


revolution.
 We've
 had
 him
 on
 before.
 He


was
 great.
 We're
 going
 to
 be
 speaking


with
 Terry
 Duffy,
 the
 chairman
 and
 CEO


of
 CME.
 So,
 Terry,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


coming
 back
 on
 All
 Thoughts.


>> Tracy,
 Joe,
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 for


having
 me.
 Appreciate
 you
 being
 here
 in


Chicago
 also.


>> Well,
 the
 last
 time
 we
 saw
 you
 two
 years


ago,
 you
 said
 we
 were
 going
 to
 be


replaced
 by
 AI
 and
 that
 hasn't
 happened.


So,
 I'm
 very
 happy
 that
 we're
 back
 and


talking
 to
 you
 in
 person.
 tape
 of
 that


cuz
 I'm
 not
 so
 sure
 that's
 true.


>> I
 got
 proof.
 I
 got
 the
 transcript.


>> You
 have
 everybody
 remembers
 something,


but
 let
 me
 see
 the
 proof.


>> I'll
 send
 it
 to
 you
 after
 this.
 All


right.
 Uh,
 so
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 we


wanted
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 about
 retail


trading
 specifically
 is
 because
 CME
 just


announced
 this
 partnership
 with
 FanDuel


where
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 offering
 these


sort
 of
 event
 contracts.
 Walk
 us
 through


exactly
 what
 the
 partnership
 entails.


>> Well,
 the
 partnership
 is
 really


interesting
 from
 a
 whole
 host
 of


reasons.
 I
 believe
 that
 the
 market
 in


general
 has
 changed
 and
 the
 evolution
 of


the
 market
 has
 changed.
 The
 participants


have
 changed
 and
 we
 can
 all
 determine


why
 that
 is.
 We
 can
 listen
 to
 what
 Joe


said
 in
 his
 opening
 about
 how


traditional
 exchanges
 want
 to
 have
 the


gaming
 uh
 clients
 in
 their
 world
 or
 we


could
 say
 that
 the
 gaming
 clients
 want


to
 have
 the
 traditional
 finance
 people


in
 their
 worlds.
 These
 worlds
 have
 have


been
 clashing
 for
 quite
 some
 time
 now.


Why
 is
 that?
 It's
 all
 because
 of


technology.
 Technology
 has
 enabled
 the


participant
 from
 all
 levels
 to
 be
 on
 a


level
 playing
 field.
 So
 example
 being


institutional
 participants
 traditionally


had
 the
 greatest
 technology
 and
 in


return
 the
 products
 were
 customs
 sized


for
 institutional
 participants.
 As
 the


markets
 evolved,
 retail
 participants


want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 participate,
 but
 they


really
 couldn't
 participate
 at
 the
 size


of
 a
 contract
 that
 the
 institutions
 can.


So,
 we
 customized
 over
 the
 last
 several


years
 smaller
 and
 smaller
 contracts.


Well,
 we
 went
 from
 E-
 Minis
 to
 micros


and
 potentially
 nanos.
 Now,
 we're


looking
 into
 the
 prediction
 markets


going
 forward.
 Why
 is
 that?
 Well,


there's
 a
 host
 of
 reasons,
 but
 like
 I


said,
 technology
 and
 let's
 talk
 about
 it


again.
 artificial
 intelligence.
 It's
 the


hottest
 thing
 God
 put
 on
 the
 planet


right
 now
 as
 far
 as
 financial
 services


goes
 because
 otherwise
 the
 stock
 market


would
 not
 be
 trading
 where
 it's
 at
 today


because
 the
 market
 has
 been
 driven


primarily
 by
 artificial
 intelligence


stocks
 over
 the
 last
 48
 months
 for
 sure.


There's
 no
 other
 stocks
 really


participating
 the
 way
 Nvidia
 and
 some
 of


the
 other
 big
 ones
 are.
 So
 my
 point


being
 is
 today
 the
 guy
 that
 would
 never


be
 able
 to
 trade
 futures
 because
 he's


got
 a
 $500
 account
 or
 $1,000
 account
 or


that's
 what
 he
 has
 available
 to


participate
 in.
 Now
 we're
 able
 to
 give


him
 the
 technology
 that
 Goldman
 Sachs


may
 or
 may
 not
 have
 that
 some
 of
 the


biggest
 hedge
 funds
 in
 the
 world
 may
 or


may
 not
 have.
 How
 he
 or
 she
 deploys
 that


is
 up
 to
 them,
 but
 they're
 going
 to
 have


access
 to
 that
 technology.
 That's
 why


these
 worlds
 are
 colliding.
 And
 I
 think


it's
 massively
 exciting
 about
 the


future.
 And
 people
 listen,
 we're
 going


to
 have
 the
 biggest
 wealth
 transfer
 by


2040.
 We're
 going
 to
 have
 $80
 trillion


go
 from
 or
 I
 think
 it's
 2050
 from
 the


existing
 population
 to
 people
 of
 the
 age


of
 40
 to
 24.
 $85
 trillion
 of
 wealth


transfer.
 Those
 people
 want
 to
 be
 in


control
 of
 their
 own
 destiny.
 Why?


Because
 they've
 grown
 up
 in
 control
 of


their
 own
 destinies
 today,
 that
 age


group,
 whether
 it's
 through
 the
 apps
 on


their
 phone
 or
 other
 things.
 So,
 I
 think


having
 access
 to
 all
 different


constituencies
 is
 really
 important.
 And


so,
 I'm
 excited
 by
 the
 future
 of
 this


marketplace.


>> Let's
 just
 talk
 more
 details
 on
 FanDuel.


Is
 the
 idea
 basically
 that
 let's
 say
 I'm


or
 I
 don't
 I've
 never
 gotten
 into
 sports


betting,
 but
 suppose
 I
 did.
 suppose
 I


were,
 you
 know,
 and
 I
 open
 an
 app
 and
 I


see
 the
 line
 for
 the
 upcoming
 Raiders


Bears
 game
 or
 whatever
 it
 is
 the
 idea


that
 in
 that
 same
 app
 I
 may
 see
 the


price
 of
 some
 the
 gold
 futures
 or


interest
 rate
 futures
 or
 something
 that


I
 can
 trade
 at
 a
 monetary
 denomination


that
 is
 sort
 of
 we
 associate
 with
 retail


level.
 Is
 that
 the
 specific
 product
 or


service
 that
 the
 CME
 is
 going to
 be


offering
 with
 FanDuel?


>> So
 Joe,
 yes,
 it's
 similar
 to
 that.
 So


today,
 FanDuel
 is
 set
 up
 a
 little
 bit


different
 than
 some
 of
 their


competitors.
 They
 don't
 have
 one
 app
 for


all
 different
 services.
 They
 have
 single


apps
 for
 different
 services
 where
 some


of
 the
 other
 ones
 have
 different
 apps


and
 for
 whatever
 reason
 they
 feel
 it's


an
 advantage.
 So
 there
 will
 be
 a
 markets


app,
 a
 FanDuel
 markets
 app
 powered
 by


CME
 Group.
 When
 you
 open
 up
 their


homepage,
 you'll
 go
 to
 that
 app
 and
 then


you'll
 see
 in
 there
 we'll
 have


potentially
 three
 to
 four
 event


contracts
 a
 day
 per
 asset
 class.
 The


events
 will
 go
 on
 for
 approximately
 60


minutes.
 They're
 they're
 not
 like
 a


sporting
 event
 that
 goes
 on
 throughout


the
 event.
 It
 will
 be
 a
 60inute
 window.


Then
 we
 will
 say,
 will
 the
 price
 of
 gold


be
 above
 or
 below
 $3,700
 an
 ounce


>> at
 the
 end
 of
 that
 60
 minutes?


>> Yes.


>> Okay.


>> They're
 very
 binary.


>> And
 you
 will
 see
 as
 the
 opening
 of
 that


event
 starts
 where
 the
 price
 is
 set.
 And


it
 might
 be
 set
 at
 50
 cents.
 it's
 going


to
 be
 above
 it
 because
 it's
 kind
 of
 in


the
 middle
 or
 if
 it's
 higher
 it
 might
 be


80
 cents
 to
 say
 it's
 going to
 be
 above


it
 but
 not
 there's
 nothing
 to
 say
 it's


going
 to
 be
 above
 it.
 So
 you'll
 have


people
 taking
 both
 sides
 expressing


their
 interest
 on
 the
 value
 of
 gold


which
 will
 also


>> give
 us
 the
 ability
 because
 we
 have
 the


liquidity
 providers
 in
 our
 core
 asset


classes.
 So
 the
 deep
 pools
 of
 liquidity


with
 this
 will
 be
 amazing.
 Just
 to
 be


clear,
 is
 the
 60inute
 window
 is
 that


just
 like
 the
 first
 round?
 Like


eventually
 do
 you
 anticipate
 that
 it'll


be
 weekly
 or
 monthly
 or
 something
 that


resembles
 the
 time
 intervals
 of


traditional?


>> That's
 a
 great
 question,
 Joe.
 So,
 what


we
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 is
 we'll


probably
 run
 three
 events
 a
 day.


>> Okay.


>> For
 say
 gold,
 we'll
 run
 three
 events
 a


day
 for
 crude
 oil.
 We'll
 run
 three


events
 a
 day
 for
 the
 S&P
 500.
 We'll
 run


three
 events
 a
 day
 for
 some
 of
 our
 other


asset
 classes,
 treasuries,
 and
 these


will
 be
 multiple
 events,
 but
 they're


only
 going
 to
 be
 an
 hour
 long,
 but
 we'll


probably
 run
 three
 to
 four
 sessions


every
 day.
 So,
 they'll
 be
 an
 hour
 per


session.
 And
 that
 will
 run
 five
 days
 a


week
 for
 markets.
 And
 if
 in
 fact,


FanDuel
 wants
 to
 put
 sports
 up
 there,
 as


you
 know,
 those
 are
 weekend
 events
 as


well.


>> Well,
 let
 me
 ask
 the
 really
 sexy


question
 then.
 Um,
 how
 exactly
 are
 these


trades
 or
 contracts
 structured?
 And
 you


mentioned
 the
 liquidity
 providers
 there.


Walk
 us
 through
 exactly
 the
 mechanics
 of


these
 trades.
 Who
 are
 the
 providers?


What
 does
 the
 market
 making
 look
 like?


Are
 they
 being
 cleared?
 How
 does
 it
 all


work?


>> They
 will
 be
 centrally
 cleared
 through


CME's
 clearing
 house.
 So
 yes,
 they
 will


be.
 The
 market
 structure
 will
 not
 look


too
 dissimilar
 to
 what
 we
 have
 today.


The
 market
 participants,
 we
 have


multiple
 market
 makers
 versus
 where
 some


of
 our
 competitors
 have
 a
 single
 market


maker
 doing
 this.
 uh
 we
 will
 have
 as
 you


know
 at
 CMA
 Group
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of


market
 makers
 in
 our
 different
 products


they
 will
 have
 access
 to
 these
 event


contracts
 and
 they
 will
 create
 the


liquidity
 throughout
 the
 day
 and
 we
 will


incent
 them
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the


participants
 have
 a
 tight
 deep
 market
 so


that's
 basically
 how
 it'll
 work
 Tracy


>> and
 do
 the
 market
 makers
 have
 to
 hedge


their
 exposure
 or
 are
 these
 contracts
 so


small
 that
 it's
 not
 a
 big
 deal
 or


>> well
 you
 know
 small
 contracts
 can
 be


small
 Tracy
 but
 as
 you
 know
 you
 trade


enough
 of
 anything
 that's
 small
 turns


into
 something
 big


>> and
 I'm
 sure
 you
 want
 this
 to
 Of
 course


we
 do.
 So,
 but
 they
 will
 have
 access
 to


lay
 off
 that
 risk
 in
 the
 primary
 markets


and
 that's
 the
 big
 difference
 with
 our


offering.
 So,
 we
 will
 be
 offering
 our


deep
 liquid
 products
 and
 we'll
 have


events
 with
 them.
 So,
 our
 market
 makers


will
 seamlessly
 be
 able
 to
 uh
 offset


these
 contracts.


>> You'd
 said
 in
 the
 beginning
 that


>> or
 not,
 by
 the
 way,
 or
 not,
 that's
 up
 to


them.
 You
 said
 in
 the
 beginning
 that


technology
 is
 part
 of
 the
 story
 of
 why


these
 two
 worlds
 of
 gambling
 versus


legacy
 finance
 are
 have
 been
 colliding


or
 maybe
 merging
 etc.
 And
 I
 believe
 that


and
 I
 also
 believe
 that
 the
 there
 is
 no


such
 thing
 as
 a
 bright
 line
 between


what's
 investing
 and
 what's
 speculation.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 debate
 about
 all
 of


that.
 But
 is
 another
 element
 here


essentially
 that
 the
 norms
 have
 changed.


There
 used
 to
 be
 an
 expectation
 that
 you


know
 retail
 investors
 didn't
 have
 access


to
 say
 like
 private
 um
 private


investments
 the
 there
 used
 to
 be
 it
 used


to
 be
 much
 harder
 to
 gamble
 on
 sports


period.
 There's
 been
 a
 big
 change
 in
 the


norms
 it
 seems
 and
 then
 follow
 on


regulation
 such
 that
 by
 and
 large
 it


seems
 to
 be
 conventional
 wisdom
 that


people
 should
 be
 really
 allowed
 to
 trade


anything
 they
 want
 on
 anything
 they


want.
 Well,
 I
 I
 think
 there's
 some
 truth


to
 that,
 but
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 pretty


broad
 brush
 of
 should
 people
 be
 able
 to


trade
 anything
 they
 want
 and
 anything


they
 want.
 I
 think
 you
 listen,


regulation
 breeds
 credibility
 to
 any


product.
 And
 if
 it's
 not
 regulated
 to
 a


point
 and
 it's
 the
 wild
 west,
 somebody's


going
 to
 get
 hurt
 and
 and
 that's
 not


what
 a
 company
 like
 mine
 that
 I'm
 the


chairman
 and
 CEO
 of
 and
 I
 have
 been
 for


the
 last
 23
 24
 years
 now.
 I
 that's
 not


something
 that
 I
 would
 want
 to
 bring


forward
 into
 this
 company.
 I
 you
 said


something
 else
 that
 I
 and
 I'm
 going to


get
 back
 to
 the
 regulatory
 part,
 but
 you


said
 something
 really
 interesting.
 Is
 it


investing
 or
 is
 it
 speculating?
 Let
 me


ask
 you
 a
 question.
 This
 is
 rhetorical.


You
 ever
 see
 an
 investment
 that
 doesn't


have
 if
 you're
 making
 an
 investment,
 you


need
 somebody
 to
 take
 the
 opposite
 side


of
 that
 trait.


>> And
 if
 another
 investor
 is
 going
 the


same
 direction,
 there's
 reasons
 why


Oracle
 went
 up
 30%
 two
 weeks
 ago
 after


their
 announcement.
 Why?
 Because
 no
 one


want
 to
 get
 run
 over
 by
 a
 freight
 train.


You
 need
 speculation
 in
 order
 to


increase
 investment.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 I
 think
 that
 you
 know
 people
 say
 that


speculators
 are
 bad
 for
 the
 market.


Well,
 who's
 going
 to
 create
 the


liquidity
 for
 the
 investors
 if
 we
 don't


have
 speculators?
 So
 that's
 point
 one.


Going
 back
 to
 the
 regulation,
 I
 think


that
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 regulation
 for


these
 products,
 we
 have
 to
 let
 the


participants
 be
 made
 aware
 through


education
 and
 other
 tools
 of
 what
 the


rules
 of
 the
 road
 are.
 And
 I
 think
 right


now
 with
 the
 crypto
 world
 where
 it's


going
 right
 now
 in
 some
 of
 the
 other


marketplaces
 where
 they're
 at
 on
 the


predictions,
 I
 think
 there's
 some


confusion.
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 doing
 a
 round


table
 in
 DC
 this
 coming
 Monday


associated
 with
 just
 these
 type
 of


topics
 of
 what
 what's
 innovation,
 what's


not.
 And
 so
 Joe,
 I
 think
 your
 questions


are
 really
 really
 strong.
 And
 that's
 one


of
 the
 reasons
 I'm
 doing
 this
 deal
 with


FanDuel
 because
 I
 want
 to
 walk
 before
 I


run
 here.
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 important


>> but
 I
 do
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the


retail
 participant
 has
 the
 ability
 to


participate
 at
 their
 level.
 That's
 why


these
 contracts
 will
 be
 binary
 in


nature.
 That's
 why
 these
 contracts
 will


be
 a
 dollar
 so
 anybody
 can
 participate.


But
 again,
 I
 think
 that
 the
 ultimate


regulatory
 framework
 as
 it
 goes
 forward


has
 yet
 to
 be
 harmonized,
 for
 a
 lack
 of


a
 better
 term,
 between
 traditional


marketplaces
 and
 now
 we're
 looking
 at


event
 contracts
 on
 sports
 and
 other
 uh


indices.


So,
 I'm
 excited
 by
 this,
 Joe,
 but
 I
 I


think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 you
 said
 in


your
 question
 that's
 yet
 to
 be
 answered.


And
 the
 problem
 is
 right
 now
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 people
 going
 out
 with
 offerings


before
 these
 questions
 have
 been
 asked,


answered,
 or
 for
 sure
 studied.


>> We
 we've
 talked
 to
 some
 and
 we're


talking
 to
 some
 more
 of
 them


>> for
 sure.


[Music]


Okay.
 Okay.
 Well,
 speaking
 of
 regulatory


harmonization,
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 I'm


going
 to
 hit
 all
 the
 really
 provocative


topics
 today
 and
 ask
 about
 tax


treatment.
 Um,
 because
 my
 understanding


is
 that
 losses
 on
 futures
 contracts
 are


treated
 differently
 under
 new
 tax
 rules


than
 losses
 on
 platforms
 for
 sports


betting
 and
 things
 like
 that.
 How
 much


of
 the
 interest
 that
 you're
 seeing
 from


places
 like
 FanDuel
 and
 other
 markets
 is


coming
 from
 I
 guess
 the
 possibility
 of


people
 being
 able
 to
 trade
 with
 futures


contracts
 or
 bet
 using
 futures
 contracts


and
 not
 having
 to
 pay
 as
 much
 in
 tax.


>> So
 let's
 make
 sure
 we
 understand
 both


sides
 of
 the
 equation.
 You
 said
 only


losses
 gains
 as
 well.
 So
 we'll
 talk


about
 tax
 treatment
 in
 general.
 So
 what


what
 what
 Tracy's
 referring
 to
 listeners


at
 oddlots
 is
 what's
 called
 1256


contracts
 under
 the
 tax
 code
 which


allows
 people
 to
 get
 a
 blended
 rate
 of


60/40
 tax
 treatment.
 60
 long-term
 gains,


40
 short-term
 comes
 out
 to
 a
 blended


rate
 of
 about
 27%.
 Futures
 contracts


cannot
 get
 um
 long-term
 capital
 gains


because
 of
 the
 way
 they
 expire
 today.
 So


we
 don't
 get
 long-term
 capital.
 So
 we


get
 what's
 called
 1256
 treatment.
 That's


what
 Tracy
 I
 believe
 you're
 referring


to.
 That
 was
 a
 great
 explanation
 by
 the


way.
 You
 should
 host.


>> Thank
 you.
 Anyway,
 the
 1256
 contract.


So,
 when
 you
 talk
 about
 sports,
 sports


will
 not
 be
 treated
 on
 event
 contracts


under
 the
 1256
 regulation.
 But
 gold,


equities,
 all
 our
 other
 core
 businesses


on
 events,
 we
 will
 believe
 that
 they
 are


event
 futures,
 not
 event
 swaps.


>> So,
 we
 swaps
 are
 not
 treated
 under
 1256.


uh
 futures
 are.
 So
 we
 think
 our
 events


on
 our
 market
 participants
 and
 those


products
 will
 be
 treated
 with
 the
 same


tax
 treatment
 we
 get
 today
 for
 our
 other


businesses
 and
 then
 events
 such
 as


entertainment,
 such
 as
 political
 events


and
 sporting
 events
 will
 be
 traded
 as


ordinary
 income.


>> Got
 it.


>> Are
 you
 going
 to
 enter


um
 political
 betting
 markets?


>> I
 would
 not
 take
 anything
 off
 the
 table.


It's
 not
 something
 that
 I
 support
 at


this
 moment.
 But
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 things


I
 think
 when
 people
 say
 they
 don't


support
 and
 then
 all
 of a
 sudden
 they
 do


it
 and
 you
 go,
 "Well,
 what
 changed
 your


mind?"
 And
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 good
 reason.


So,
 I
 never
 said
 I
 wouldn't
 list


Bitcoin.
 I
 just
 thought
 it
 was
 important


to
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 timing
 is
 right.


So,
 I
 waited
 till
 2017.
 Then
 one
 day
 I


said,
 "Today
 is
 the
 day
 because
 the


timing
 seems
 right
 to
 me."
 So,
 I
 never


said
 I
 wouldn't
 do
 it.
 Even
 though
 there


was
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 between
 2008
 when


the
 price
 of
 Bitcoin
 was
 $8


>> to
 2017
 when
 I
 listed
 it


>> uh
 that
 said
 that
 this
 stuff
 is
 tulips.


It's
 garbage.
 Don't
 trade
 it.


>> All right.
 Let's
 hear
 your
 thinking
 on


the
 politics
 markets.


>> So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 we're
 going to
 get
 to


the
 politics.
 So,
 I
 don't
 believe
 right


now
 that
 event
 markets
 on
 politics
 are
 a


good
 thing.
 That's
 my
 take
 on
 it.
 I
 want


to
 see
 how
 it
 goes
 out.
 I
 didn't
 like


mail


um
 mail
 in
 uh
 voting
 either.
 I
 thought


voting
 should
 have
 been
 in
 person


historically,
 but
 my
 mind
 has
 changed
 on


that
 too
 for
 a
 whole
 host
 of
 reasons


because
 now
 we
 get
 more
 participants


>> and
 we
 have
 technology
 to
 protect


against
 bad
 behavior
 in
 voting.
 I
 think


we
 can
 get
 the
 same
 on
 these
 event


contracts
 for
 different
 events.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 it's
 there
 or
 not
 yet.
 We've
 had


one
 political
 event
 contract
 that
 was


listed
 so
 far
 that
 we
 that
 we're
 aware


of
 and
 that
 was
 the
 presidential


election,
 right?
 So
 that's
 for
 the
 most


part
 that's
 all
 that's
 happened.
 I
 think


that's
 kind
 of
 a
 a
 small
 sample
 of
 uh


political
 event
 contracts
 to
 base
 your


decision
 on.
 Is
 this
 good
 or
 bad?
 So
 I


kind
 of
 want
 to
 see
 how
 it
 goes,
 Joe,
 to


answer
 your
 question.
 So
 I
 don't
 see
 the


rush
 to
 get
 into
 it.
 And
 the
 the
 reason


why
 I
 don't
 see
 the
 rush
 to
 get
 into
 it,


if
 you
 look
 at
 CME
 today
 with
 XRP
 on
 the


on
 the
 Ripple
 uh
 crypto
 contract,
 we
 are


the
 premier
 place
 for
 people
 to
 mitigate


and
 manage
 risk
 on
 Ripple.
 Now,
 I
 was


one
 of the
 last
 people
 to
 get
 into


crypto
 in
 2017,
 but
 yet
 we
 have
 one
 of


the
 biggest
 marketplace.
 I
 just
 listed


Ripple.
 So,
 the
 credibility
 of
 CME
 is


very
 important
 to
 me.
 I
 think
 it's


important
 to
 my
 customers
 as
 well.


That's
 why
 I'm
 very
 cautious
 about
 some


of these
 political
 contracts.
 So
 that's


why
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 tie
 the
 two
 together


a
 little
 bit.


>> All
 right.
 Sorry.


>> Fair
 enough.


>> Yeah,
 fair
 enough.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 um,
 you
 mentioned
 going
 to
 a
 round


table
 next
 week
 and
 I
 believe
 that's
 the


one
 being
 held
 in
 DC.


>> Is
 that
 right?
 Okay.
 So,
 I
 know
 the
 CEO


of
 Kouchi
 is
 supposed
 to
 be
 there.
 Um,


never
 met
 him.


>> One
 of
 the
 preeminent
 prediction
 markets


in
 the
 world.
 Uh,
 when
 you
 see
 him,
 what


questions
 would
 you
 ask
 in
 order
 to


better
 understand
 political
 prediction


markets?


>> I
 mean,
 we're
 interviewing
 him
 tonight


in
 Chicago.
 Basically,
 Tracy's
 asking


what
 you
 would
 like
 us
 to
 ask
 him.


>> I
 I
 don't
 know
 the
 gentleman.
 I've
 never


met
 the
 gentleman.
 I
 have
 no
 idea.
 I
 I


think
 what's
 important
 is


>> that


he
 understands
 that
 we
 because
 the
 CFTC


and
 that's
 what
 they
 are
 suggesting


right
 now,
 which
 is
 true.
 So,
 I'm
 not


saying
 what
 he's
 saying
 is
 wrong.
 They


self-certify
 these
 contracts.
 Does
 it


make
 it
 right
 for
 him
 to
 list
 all
 these


different
 contracts
 because
 the
 CFTC's


got
 24
 hours
 to
 make
 a
 decision


to
 either
 stop
 it
 or
 or
 let
 it
 go?
 It's


really
 hard
 under
 the
 self-certification


process
 to
 understand
 anything
 in
 24


hours
 especially
 for
 the
 government.
 So


the
 question
 I
 would
 have
 for
 him
 as
 I


do
 for
 myself
 is
 how
 are
 these
 some
 of


these
 contracts
 not
 novel
 and
 complex


and
 don't
 you
 believe
 that
 your


investors
 need
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 time
 by


the
 government
 agencies
 to
 make
 sure


that
 there
 everyone's
 comfortable
 so
 you


can
 offer
 them
 in
 a
 way
 that
 is
 very


sound
 mind
 and
 sound
 business
 to
 grow


them
 versus
 just
 going
 out
 there
 after


24
 hours
 of
 nobody
 objecting
 and
 now


you're
 promoting
 and
 he
 is
 promoting


that
 these
 are
 CFTC
 approved
 approved


products.
 They're
 technically
 that
 is


wrong.
 They
 are
 not
 CFTC
 approved


products.
 What
 they
 are
 is
 they
 have
 not


been
 opposed
 by
 the
 CFTC.
 There's
 a
 big


difference
 there
 and
 that's
 the
 part


that
 they
 are
 not
 disclosing
 to
 their


user
 base.
 And
 so
 I
 would
 say
 to
 him
 or


others
 and
 I
 will
 say
 it
 because
 I
 say


what
 I
 want
 to
 say
 to
 people


respectfully.
 I
 think
 disclosure
 is


good.
 It's
 like
 payment
 for
 order
 flow.


I
 don't
 think
 payment
 for
 order
 flow


should
 be
 on
 the
 34th
 page
 of
 a


perspective.
 put
 it
 up
 front,
 tell
 the


clients
 that's
 what
 you're
 doing
 and


nobody's
 got
 a
 concern
 with
 it,
 but
 we


don't
 because
 why?
 And
 I
 would
 say
 that


people
 are
 maybe
 a
 little
 thinking
 that


it
 maybe
 it
 shouldn't
 happen.
 I
 think
 it


helps
 the
 marketplace,
 but
 tell
 people


that
 earlier
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 you


guys
 should
 ask
 him.
 Why
 won't
 you
 say


that
 these
 are
 not
 approved?
 They're


just
 not
 objected
 to.


>> Joe,
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 my
 best
 Terry
 Duffy


impression
 tonight
 and
 just
 ask
 that


question
 verbatim.


>> And
 if
 you
 if
 you
 drop
 my
 name,
 boy,


Monday
 could
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 fun.
 Oh,
 yeah.


Okay.
 Right.
 Um,
 but
 no,
 this
 gets
 to
 my


question
 about
 norms
 because
 like
 so


political
 prediction
 markets
 have


existed
 in
 the
 US
 on
 very
 small
 scale


for
 maybe
 like
 20
 years.
 There
 was
 the


Iowa
 it
 was
 an
 experimental
 thing
 from


the
 University
 of
 Iowa
 etc.
 It
 feels


like
 the
 floodgates
 have
 gone
 open
 and


that
 actually
 you
 know
 under
 the
 last


administration
 for
 better
 or
 worse
 uh


Kelshi


um
 Poly
 Market
 which
 it's
 another
 sort


of
 can
 of
 worms
 they
 were
 under
 a
 lot
 of


regulatory
 scrutiny
 investigations
 and


they
 still
 operated
 etc.
 Now
 it
 seems


like
 the
 doors
 been
 flung
 open.
 Maybe


like
 it
 basically
 seems
 like
 we
 have


whether
 from
 a
 strictly
 legal


perspective
 or
 a
 cultural
 perspective


very
 little
 appetite
 in
 this
 country
 to


say
 you
 can't
 do
 this.
 Uh
 it
 feels
 like


yeah
 the
 barn
 door
 is
 open
 on
 a
 lot
 of


this
 stuff.


>> So
 Joel,
 let's
 let's
 talk
 about
 that
 a


little
 bit
 because
 I
 think
 it's


interesting.
 The


under
 the
 commodity
 exchange
 act
 there


is
 a
 provision
 where
 a
 contract
 cannot


be
 readily
 manipulable.


>> Okay.


>> All
 right.
 So
 that
 that's
 a
 law.
 So
 when


we're
 looking
 at
 prediction
 markets
 on


political
 outcomes
 and
 we're
 talking


about
 a
 presidential
 election,
 we're


talking
 about


100
 plus
 million
 people
 potentially


voting
 with
 a
 with
 a
 base
 of
 voters
 more


open
 than
 that.
 Fine.
 Okay.
 Maybe
 we
 say


understand,
 okay,
 that's
 no
 different


than
 some
 of
 these
 other
 big
 markets.


That's
 a
 big
 market
 all
 of
 a
 sudden.


>> Now
 we'll
 take
 it
 down
 to
 the
 Congress.


We
 have
 less
 people
 voting
 in
 a


congressional
 race
 for
 Congress.


Correct.
 So
 every
 member


>> every
 500,000
 people
 gets
 a
 member
 of


Congress
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 So
 now


you
 got
 500,000
 people
 of
 a
 population


gets
 a
 member
 of
 Congress.
 The
 voting


population
 for
 that
 is
 much
 much
 smaller


that's
 eligible
 to
 vote.
 Now
 let's
 take


it
 to
 the
 next
 level.
 We
 have
 got
 a


local
 mayor's
 race
 in
 a
 suburb
 that
 you


live
 in
 that
 there
 is
 500
 people
 there.


You
 want
 a
 prediction
 market
 on
 that?


Because
 I'll
 tell
 you
 what,
 I
 could


probably
 buy
 that
 election
 and
 have
 my


prediction
 market
 be
 pay
 off
 in
 a
 big


way
 and
 and
 that
 would
 be
 deemed
 readily


manipulable.
 Now,
 I
 gave
 you
 a
 a
 pretty


wild
 spectrum
 there.
 Sure.


>> But
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to
 look
 at
 it
 in


that
 range.
 That's
 my
 whole
 point
 what
 I


said
 to
 Tracy
 earlier.
 We
 have
 to
 let


people
 know
 what
 they're
 doing
 because


every
 political
 event
 is
 not
 a


presidential
 election.
 Yeah.
 There
 are


some
 political
 events
 that
 are
 so
 small


that
 could
 be
 deemed
 readily
 maneuable


and
 you
 don't
 ever
 want
 to
 get
 in
 that


situation
 because
 that's
 how
 you
 destroy


innovation
 and
 that's
 my
 concern
 with


some
 of
 the
 political
 markets.


>> Joe,
 remember
 when
 we
 did
 that
 live


experiment
 at
 our
 show?


>> What
 was
 our
 big
 takeaway
 from
 that?


>> Um,
 I
 don't
 remember
 a
 take
 away.
 It
 was


very
 funny.
 It
 was
 the
 when
 we
 had
 uh


the
 manifold
 market
 of
 whether
 Zosvitz


would
 be
 on
 the
 Oddlaws
 podcast
 and
 then


we
 brought
 him
 on
 stage
 and
 we
 saw
 the


price
 adjust
 in
 real
 time.


>> Just
 to
 be
 clear,
 we
 did
 not
 bet
 that
 he


was
 going
 to
 be
 on
 the
 podcast,
 but
 you


know,
 he
 could
 have
 he
 could
 have
 um


>> he
 could
 have


>> he
 could
 have
 certainly.
 Okay,
 let's


broaden
 out
 the
 conversation
 a
 little


bit
 to
 overall
 retail
 trading,
 which
 has


obviously
 become
 a
 big
 part
 of
 your


business.
 When
 you
 think
 about
 the


evolution
 of
 retail
 trading
 at
 CME
 over


the
 past
 few
 years,
 what
 are
 the
 biggest


takeaways
 in
 terms
 of
 I
 guess
 the
 needs


or
 concerns
 of
 a
 retail
 trader
 versus
 an


institutional
 or
 professional
 one?


Obviously,
 you
 talked
 about
 contract


size
 earlier,
 but
 like
 what
 else
 do
 you


see
 out
 there
 in
 terms
 of
 key


differences?


>> I
 think
 the
 key
 difference
 is
 the
 ease


of
 access
 for
 the
 retail
 participant
 to


sign
 onto
 a
 platform.
 Historically,
 it's


been
 very
 very
 difficult
 and
 a
 very


difficult
 process
 uh
 to
 sign
 up
 to
 trade


markets,
 whether
 they're
 securities
 or


whether
 they're
 futures.
 So,
 um
 the


retail
 participant
 will
 go
 through
 an


application
 and
 probably
 get
 through


halfway
 through
 page
 one
 and
 go,
 you


know,
 this
 this
 is
 ridiculous.
 There's
 a


reason
 why,
 Tracy
 and
 Joe,
 that
 the
 dark


market
 or
 the
 illegal
 market
 in
 gambling


is
 still
 about
 three
 times
 larger
 than


the
 regulated
 marketplace
 because
 people


just
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 have
 that
 exposure


of
 giving
 out
 their
 information,
 right?


So
 that
 it's
 still
 a
 very
 large
 market,


the
 illegal
 gaming
 market.
 Um,
 I
 think


that
 when
 you
 to
 create
 a
 greater
 ease


for
 people,
 which
 is
 going
 on
 right
 now


for
 us,
 especially
 with
 the
 FanDuel,


you'll
 go
 through
 an
 app.
 It'll
 be
 a


five-click
 process
 and
 you'll
 be
 ready


to
 go.
 That
 historically
 has
 never


happened.
 Secondly,
 the
 retail


participants
 have
 never
 had
 a
 place
 to


go
 to
 clear
 their
 trades.
 As
 you
 know,


at
 CME,
 we
 don't
 directly
 take
 clients.


They
 have
 to
 come
 through
 one
 of
 our


member
 clients.


>> So,
 those
 people
 didn't
 want
 some
 of


these
 really
 small
 clients
 because
 they


were
 a
 risk.
 But
 technology
 all
 of
 a


sudden
 has
 allowed
 the
 risk
 management


tools
 to
 let
 them
 participate
 and
 you


could
 do
 and
 the
 one
 thing
 I
 liked
 about


Sam
 Bank's
 offering
 and
 I
 give
 Sam


credit
 for
 this
 was
 auto
 liquidating.


Auto
 liquidation
 is
 something
 that
 a
 lot


of
 people
 have
 already
 implemented
 they


call
 it
 something
 different.
 So
 that


risk
 management
 tools
 that
 we
 have
 in


place
 that
 others
 have
 in
 place
 has
 now


allowed
 us
 to
 take
 on
 the
 retail
 clients


and
 the
 ease
 of
 them
 coming
 in.
 Thirdly,


I
 think
 it's
 really
 important
 that
 you


educate
 them
 what
 exactly
 they're
 doing.


>> And
 futures
 can
 be
 very
 frightening.


People
 get
 very
 frightened.
 Like
 during


the
 pandemic
 when
 the
 explosion
 of
 day


trading
 started
 to
 happen
 again,
 there


was
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 were
 on
 some
 of


these
 retail
 platforms
 that
 had


positions
 on
 that
 don't
 even
 know
 how


they
 got
 them
 on
 cuz
 they
 didn't


understand
 it,
 but
 they
 were
 almost


embarrassed
 to
 ask
 what
 happened.


>> Whether
 they
 got
 caught
 up
 in
 an
 option


straddle
 or
 something
 else,
 they
 did
 not


even
 realize
 what
 happened.
 So
 education


is
 key
 and
 that's
 one
 of the
 things
 that


we
 have
 been
 constantly
 hammering
 home.


So
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 the
 retail


business
 is
 very
 exciting
 for
 CME
 and


for
 other
 platforms
 around
 the
 world.


Ecosystems
 are
 important.
 One
 of
 the


things
 I
 tell
 my
 team
 all
 the
 time,
 I


said,
 "You
 better
 look
 over
 your


shoulder
 and
 see
 a
 line
 of
 clients


always
 coming
 because
 the
 day
 you
 look


over
 your
 shoulder
 and
 it's
 gone,
 you're


in
 trouble."
 And
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 a


gigantic
 institutional
 player,
 I
 think


that's
 great.
 And
 that's
 what
 CME
 is.


But
 we
 have
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 can


move
 laterally
 left
 and
 right.
 If
 you


look
 at
 historically
 the
 growth
 of


markets
 and
 what's
 happened
 in
 the
 90s,


there's
 a
 building
 across
 the
 street


from
 me.
 It
 used
 to
 be
 called
 the
 Sears


Tower,
 okay?
 Named
 after
 Sears
 and
 Rob.


They
 got
 naming
 rights
 over
 it.
 When


Sears
 was
 flying
 in
 the
 '9s,
 80s,
 and


90s,
 they
 never
 heard
 of
 a
 company


called
 Amazon.


>> Nobody
 knows
 what
 a
 Sears
 is
 anymore.


Sears
 is
 gone
 for
 the
 most
 part,
 right?


So
 why
 did
 that
 happen?
 because
 they


didn't
 adapt
 because
 they
 felt
 that


their
 vertical
 was
 so
 strong
 along
 with


some
 of
 the
 other
 ones
 and
 these
 other


new
 participants
 came
 in
 and
 destroyed


them.
 I
 cannot
 allow
 that
 to
 happen.
 So


for
 me
 to
 participate
 in
 the
 new
 world


and
 protect
 the
 world
 that's
 going
 on


today
 is
 really
 important.


>> My
 dad
 used
 to
 love
 Sears,
 Joe,
 because


he
 said
 you
 can
 always
 find
 a
 parking


space
 there.


>> Oh,
 that's
 a
 great
 that's
 a
 great
 reason


to
 shop
 somewhere.
 Well,
 actually,
 let's


pick
 up
 on
 the
 um
 the
 Sears
 versus


Amazon.
 There
 could
 be
 someone
 who


listens
 to
 this
 conversation
 and
 hears


your
 concern
 about
 the
 speed
 with
 which


Kelshi
 lists
 contracts
 that
 aren't,
 you


know,
 technically
 CFTC
 endorsed.
 And


they
 might
 say
 Terry
 is
 trying
 to
 keep


his
 um
 position
 by
 dent
 of
 regulatory


regulatory
 mode,
 etc.
 that
 ultimately


Kelshi
 or
 some
 or
 any
 others,
 but


they're
 the
 ones
 in
 the
 headlines
 these


days,
 that
 they
 could
 potentially
 be
 a


major
 player
 in
 futures
 in
 the
 future


and
 that
 one
 reason
 to
 talk
 about
 oh


there's
 these
 concerns
 is
 regulatory


concern
 and
 also
 um
 you
 know
 like


there's
 not
 like
 a
 ton
 you
 know
 you
 as


the
 CME
 I
 believe
 correct
 me
 if
 I'm


wrong
 have
 had
 very
 strong
 pricing
 power


uh
 for
 uh
 your
 futures
 and
 tech
 and
 in


most
 of
 finance


margins
 have
 generally
 been
 going
 down.


Fees
 have
 been
 going
 down.
 Brokerage


costs
 have
 been
 going
 down.
 Someone


might
 hear
 the
 story
 and
 say,
 "You're


trying
 to
 protect
 your
 ability
 to


continually
 expand
 price
 by
 doing
 things


like
 going
 to
 Washington
 and
 warning


them
 about
 how
 scary
 it
 is
 these
 new


prediction
 markets
 are."


>> Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 I
 wouldn't
 do
 that


because
 I'm
 partnering
 with
 um


FanDuel.
 So,
 that's
 not
 something
 I'm


prepared
 to
 go
 say
 how
 these
 new


prediction
 markets.
 I
 will
 say
 that


certain
 prediction
 markets
 could
 be


potentially
 scary
 like
 political


outcomes
 and
 things
 of
 that
 nature.
 So
 I


wouldn't
 say
 all
 prediction
 markets
 are


scary.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 bit
 of
 an


overstatement.
 Second
 of
 all
 on
 pricing


power.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 price
 of
 CME


today
 on
 a
 per
 contract
 basis,
 it's


cheaper
 now
 than
 it
 was
 25
 years
 ago.


>> So
 you
 might
 say
 to
 me,
 how
 could
 that


possibly
 be?
 You
 got
 all
 this
 pricing


power.
 Well,
 there
 is
 also
 another


company.
 As
 long
 as
 we're
 talking
 about


retailers,
 let's
 talk
 about
 Walmart.


There's
 a
 Walmart
 model.
 How
 about


selling
 something
 for
 less
 but
 selling
 a


hell
 of
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 it?
 My
 volume


today
 I
 do
 more
 in
 the
 first
 hour
 than
 I


did
 it
 in
 a
 week
 back
 in
 2002.
 So
 the


question
 is
 we
 do
 more
 because
 we've


have
 access
 to
 around
 the
 world
 which


allows
 me
 to
 make
 CM
 more


>> prices
 have
 not
 compressed
 or
 prices


have
 and
 your
 prices
 have
 compressed


>> my
 prices
 today
 versus
 what
 they
 were
 in


O2
 are
 completely
 different
 because
 when


you
 look
 at
 the
 headline
 price
 you're


not
 looking
 at
 the
 tiered
 pricing
 that


certain
 constituents
 get
 for
 volume.
 So


volume
 pricing
 discounts
 are
 massive


within
 our
 world.
 So
 that
 is
 a
 big
 deal.


So
 my
 average
 rate
 per
 contract
 69.70


cents
 a
 contract.
 You
 know
 it
 it
 can
 be


higher
 or
 lower
 but
 the
 volume
 could
 be


a
 lot
 less
 too.
 So
 we
 do
 quite
 well
 with


the
 model
 that
 we
 have.
 But
 we
 also
 have


pricing
 on
 market
 data
 and
 other


products
 that's
 that's
 proprietary
 to


CME
 that
 you
 may
 charge
 different
 for.


So
 that's
 different.
 I
 don't
 go
 to


Washington
 to
 ever
 be
 anti-competitive


because
 if
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


anti-competitive,
 it
 doesn't
 serve
 my


interest
 for
 the
 long
 run.


Anti-competitive
 people
 in
 nature
 is


good
 for
 the
 short
 term,
 but
 really
 bad


for
 the
 long
 term
 because
 you
 want
 that


ecosystem,
 as
 I
 said
 earlier,
 to


continue
 to
 grow.
 And
 if
 you're
 smart


and
 innovative
 enough,
 you
 will
 grow


with
 it.
 And
 that's
 one
 of the
 things


that
 I'm
 looking
 at
 with
 CME.
 That's
 why


I
 did
 a
 deal
 with
 FanDuel.
 FanDuel
 has


13
 million
 accounts
 active
 today
 in
 the


United
 States.
 Those
 will
 have
 access
 to


my
 products.
 I
 never
 had
 that
 before.


>> Yeah.


>> We're
 doing
 things
 with
 our
 retail


participants
 today
 that
 I
 think
 some
 of


my
 predecessors
 over
 the
 years
 ago.
 What


the
 hell
 has
 he
 done?


>> That
 we
 never
 would
 have
 done
 before.


>> You
 know,
 and
 I
 believe
 that
 if
 we
 still


did
 nothing
 around
 innovation,
 we
 would


be
 trading
 pork
 bellies.
 We
 would
 be


trading
 onions,
 which
 are
 illegal.
 They


dumped
 them
 all
 in
 the
 river
 and
 kept


the
 burlac
 sacks.
 Pork
 bellies
 are
 gone.


They're
 no
 longer
 here.
 So,
 we'd
 be
 out


of
 business.
 is
 my
 is
 the
 Bible.


>> I
 think
 when
 you
 go
 to
 Washington,
 maybe


tell
 they
 got
 to
 fix
 that
 onion
 thing.


>> Ask
 if
 they
 can
 set
 up
 a
 prediction


market
 for


>> that
 onion
 thing.
 Tell
 them
 they
 got


>> it's
 the
 only
 commodity
 in
 the
 world


that's
 banned
 by
 Congress.


>> I
 know


>> and
 I
 think
 we
 talked
 about
 that
 last


time
 we
 were
 together.
 But
 I
 think
 Joe,


to
 your
 point
 is
 I
 don't
 go
 there
 saying


this
 is
 bad
 or
 this
 is
 good.
 I
 go
 there


and
 saying
 let's
 have
 eyes
 wide
 open.


That's
 that's
 all
 I
 want
 because
 there's


nothing
 worse
 than
 having
 if
 someone


gets
 sick
 and
 we
 all
 get
 a
 cold
 and
 we


go
 how
 the
 hell
 did
 that
 happen?
 Well,


that
 that's
 not
 good
 for
 the


participants,
 not
 good
 for
 the


institutions.
 And
 right
 now,
 when
 you


get
 newer
 entrance
 coming
 in,
 I'm
 not


saying
 they're
 skirting
 the
 process.
 I'm


not
 saying
 Kelshi
 is
 skirting
 the


process.
 But
 when
 you
 say
 you
 have
 CFTC


approved
 products,
 let's
 make
 sure
 that


the
 the
 public
 understands
 what
 they


are.
 They
 are
 CFTC
 products
 that
 have


not
 been
 objected
 to.
 There's
 a


difference
 there.
 And
 I
 don't
 know
 if


the
 the
 end
 user
 understands
 that.


That's
 all
 my
 point
 was
 on.
 Got
 it.


[Music]


[Music]


Treasury
 futures
 are
 a
 huge
 part
 of
 your


business
 and
 I
 know
 you've
 been
 critical


of
 Howard
 Lutnik's
 new
 effort
 um
 to
 set


up
 his
 own
 sort
 of
 offering
 there.
 What


exactly
 are
 the
 issues
 that
 you
 see


there?
 And
 I
 guess
 what
 can
 the
 CME
 do


possibly
 to
 become
 more
 competitive
 in


that
 space
 against
 you
 know
 you
 haven't


had
 that
 many
 competitors
 before?


>> We've
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 competitors


throughout
 the
 years
 and
 there's
 such
 a


thing
 called
 efficiencies
 in
 the


marketplace
 Tracy
 that
 capital
 intensive


worlds
 that
 we
 live
 in
 today
 because
 of


a
 whole
 host
 of
 rules
 going
 back
 from


DoddFrank
 into
 other
 uh
 Basel
 rules
 and


things
 of
 that
 nature
 for
 the
 banks.
 We


create
 today
 around
 $60
 billion
 a
 day
 of


efficiencies
 for
 our
 market
 participants


every
 single
 day.
 And
 in
 my
 interest


rate
 uh
 area,
 it's
 $24
 billion
 a
 day
 of


market
 efficiencies.
 That's
 money
 freed


up
 that
 the
 largest
 participants
 in
 the


world
 can
 use
 it
 for
 other
 areas.
 They


don't
 have
 to
 park
 it
 with
 me
 to
 be
 in


compliance
 anymore
 because
 I
 created


those
 margin
 offsets
 for
 them.


>> I
 think
 that's
 really
 important
 uh
 going


forward.
 So
 the
 other
 part
 of
 your


question
 was


>> Lutnik.


>> Lutnik.
 Oh,
 okay.
 So,
 I
 don't
 have
 an


issue.
 Listen,
 he's
 a
 treasure,
 he's
 a


commerce
 secretary.
 Um,
 his


offering,
 my
 concern
 with
 his
 offering


is
 the
 following,
 and
 I'll
 say
 it
 a


hundred
 times.
 They
 are
 clearing
 that
 US


Treasury
 futures
 contract
 in
 the
 UK


under
 UK
 law.


In
 the
 United
 States,
 the
 law
 states


that
 if
 you
 clear
 a
 cash
 treasury,
 which


is
 under
 the
 new
 law
 coming
 up
 under
 the


cash
 the
 treasury
 clearing
 mandate


rules,
 that
 it's
 an
 SEC


single
 regulatory
 mandate,
 meaning
 you


you
 go
 wherever
 you
 want,
 but
 the
 SEC
 is


going
 to
 regulate
 you.
 My
 concern
 was


that
 futures
 expire
 into
 cash.
 So,


what's
 the
 difference
 between
 a
 future


and
 a
 cash
 market
 once
 expiration


happens
 on
 the
 future?
 Why
 wouldn't
 you


treat
 them
 the
 same?
 And
 why
 would
 you


allow
 UK
 law


>> uh
 and
 UK
 bankruptcy
 to
 let
 US


participants


in
 our
 foreign
 sovereign
 debt?
 There's


27
 trillion
 of
 US
 treasuries
 outstanding


today.
 If
 we
 have
 a
 problem
 like
 we
 saw


in
 London
 with
 the
 metals
 market
 of


nickel


>> where
 they
 busted
 the
 trades,
 they


didn't
 do
 a
 risk
 management.
 They
 just


busted
 the
 trades
 which
 left
 people


hanging.
 What's
 to
 say
 that
 the
 Bank
 of


England
 doesn't
 do
 that
 with
 the
 US


Treasury
 market
 if
 in
 fact
 somebody
 has


an
 issue?
 And
 if
 they
 have
 an
 issue
 with


that,
 what's
 to
 say
 that
 that
 part
 of


the
 market
 that
 they
 did
 that
 on
 doesn't


have
 a
 bigger
 impact
 on
 the
 US
 market?


So
 my
 issue
 is
 the
 US
 like
 every
 other


country
 in
 the
 world
 should
 have
 the


laws
 of
 its
 foreign
 sovereign
 debt
 be
 by


the
 laws
 of
 that
 nation.
 And
 we
 don't


have
 that
 in
 this
 particular
 situation.


Every
 other
 country
 in
 the
 world
 has
 the


laws
 of
 their
 country
 applied
 to
 their


sovereign
 debt
 except
 the
 United
 States


on
 futures.
 And
 they
 could
 say,
 "Well,


it's
 a
 derivative."
 No
 It's
 a


derivative.
 It's
 a
 derivative
 that
 turns


into
 the
 cash
 product.
 That's
 exactly


what
 you're
 trying
 to
 protect.
 So
 that's


my
 argument.
 I
 told
 Mr.
 Lutnik,
 I
 told


Congress,
 I
 told
 every
 regulator
 in
 the


world,
 if
 he
 wants
 to
 put
 that
 offering


in
 the
 United
 States,
 let's
 go.
 I
 want


to
 compete
 with
 him.


>> He's
 going
 to
 London.
 Do
 you
 have
 a
 good


sense
 of
 that?


>> Why?
 Yeah.
 Why?


>> Because
 they
 believe
 that
 the
 swap


dollar
 swaps
 market
 that's
 in
 London,


which
 is
 completely
 different
 than


futures,
 dollar
 swaps
 is
 fixed
 versus


floating.
 It
 is
 not
 issued
 by
 the
 United


States
 government.
 Treasury
 contracts


are
 issued
 by
 the
 government.
 Futures,


like
 I
 said,
 turned
 into
 the
 cash.
 So


they
 believe
 that
 because
 there's
 a


large


pool
 of
 dollar
 swaps
 being
 cleared
 at


London
 Clearing
 House,
 the
 offsets
 will


be
 greater
 than
 CME.


>> Oh,
 I
 see.


>> But
 that's
 not
 the
 case
 because
 I
 just


explained
 to
 you
 that
 we
 give
 $24


billion
 a
 day
 in
 efficiencies
 in
 our


interest
 complex.
 The
 only
 way
 that
 that


larger
 pool
 of
 swaps
 would
 be
 relevant


in
 creating
 a
 better
 offering
 is
 if
 they


had
 any
 futures
 volume.
 You
 have
 to
 have


the
 futures
 volume.
 We
 have
 100%
 of
 the


futures
 volume
 here
 at
 CME.
 And
 for


every
 one
 of
 those
 futures
 contracts,
 we


have
 a
 swap,
 a
 dollar
 swap
 at
 CME
 that


offsets
 it.
 And
 if
 we
 didn't,
 then
 that


would
 be
 a
 problem.
 So
 the
 question
 is,


if
 you're
 sitting
 at
 a
 dealer
 anywhere


around
 the
 world
 and
 you're
 holding
 US


futures
 and
 you
 can
 save
 the
 capital
 of


an
 offset
 with
 your
 swap,
 are
 you
 going


to
 put
 it
 at
 LCH
 because
 they're
 nice


guys?
 Are
 you
 going to
 put
 it
 at
 CME
 to


be
 part
 of
 that
 $24
 billion
 because
 it's


growing?
 My
 point
 is
 the
 futures
 has
 to


grow
 in
 order
 to
 get
 the
 larger
 pool
 of


the
 swaps
 offsets.
 And
 right
 now
 for


every
 swap
 contract
 that's
 out
 there


gets
 the
 offsets
 against
 my
 futures


products
 today.
 we're
 not
 missing
 out
 on


anything.
 So
 his
 offering
 is
 is
 a


charade
 game
 of
 saying,
 "Look
 how
 big


that
 is.
 Okay,
 it's
 big,
 but
 no
 one


needs
 it
 right
 now.
 This
 the
 the
 futures


market
 is
 what
 it
 is
 right
 now.
 It's


big,
 but
 we
 have
 the
 swaps
 to
 give
 the


offsets."
 Does
 that
 make
 sense
 to
 you?


>> It
 does.
 That's
 his
 offering.


>> Yeah.
 We
 got
 to
 get
 you
 on
 stage


debating
 Letic.
 That
 would
 be
 great.


>> Yeah.


>> Well,
 wait.


>> I
 can't
 say
 anything
 bad
 right
 now.


>> I'll
 wait
 till
 he's
 done
 then
 we
 can
 do


it.


>> Well,
 speak
 you
 didn't
 say
 anything
 bad.


I
 was,
 you
 know,
 I
 was
 not
 expecting


earlier
 to
 hear
 you
 give
 a
 little
 bit
 of


a
 hat
 tip
 to
 Sam
 Bankman
 Freed,
 but
 um


there's
 another
 thing
 and
 actually
 Sam


Bankman
 Freed
 was
 one
 of
 the
 main
 um


advocate
 or
 sort
 of
 pushers
 of
 it.
 This


this
 thing
 that
 emerged
 out
 of
 the


crypto
 world
 of
 a
 perpetual
 futures
 and


could
 they
 apply
 could
 we
 have
 oil
 per


like
 is
 there
 any
 reason
 this
 model
 in


rather
 than
 oil
 it's
 like
 the
 December


future,
 the
 January
 or
 the
 2028
 future.


Is
 there
 any
 reason
 that
 this
 tool,
 I


guess,
 product,
 whatever
 it
 is,
 that


sort
 of
 emerged
 out
 of
 crypto
 couldn't


eventually
 be
 applied
 to
 all
 of
 these


legacy
 asset
 classes?


>> It's
 against
 the
 act.


>> The
 the
 a
 futures
 contract,


>> yeah,


>> is
 defined
 as
 a
 product
 that
 is
 to
 be


price
 determined
 at
 a
 later
 date.


>> Okay.


>> It
 doesn't
 say
 it
 will
 it'll
 be
 and
 you


have
 to
 have
 a
 haha
 test,
 right,
 on


that.
 So,
 a
 50-year
 per
 is
 not
 a
 later


date.
 So
 that
 would


>> just
 because
 that's
 a
 joke.
 That
 is


would
 you
 say
 the
 haha
 test?
 That
 would


be
 like
 a


>> if
 if
 you
 created
 a
 50-year
 perpetual.


>> Yeah.


>> Which
 some
 of
 these
 people
 are
 doing
 in


Europe
 and
 others.
 Yeah.


>> They
 say,
 "Well,
 they're
 perpetuals,
 but


they'll
 they'll
 do
 something
 50
 years."


Okay.
 That's
 not
 the
 that's
 not
 the


definition
 by
 law
 of
 a
 future.


>> If
 the
 law
 were
 to
 be
 changed
 in
 the
 US,


would
 you
 see
 that
 as
 a
 innovation
 that


could
 be
 useful
 for
 uh
 these
 markets


that
 you
 trade?
 There
 are
 certain


markets
 that
 could
 never
 become


perpetuals.
 And
 there's
 a
 reason
 for


that.
 So,
 let's
 talk
 about
 what
 those


are.
 If
 you
 have
 a
 perpetual
 livestock


or
 grain
 market,
 how
 in
 the
 world
 am
 I


going
 to
 make
 or
 take
 delivery
 on


something
 that
 never
 expires?


>> Immortal
 cows,


>> right?
 How
 am
 I
 going
 to
 make
 or
 take


delivery
 on
 the
 food
 markets
 of
 the


United
 States,
 which
 is
 very
 integral


into
 pricing
 of
 these?
 So,
 deliverable


products


>> can


>> what
 else
 is
 deliverable?
 The
 United


States
 Treasury
 market
 is
 deliverable,


>> right?
 Because
 they
 expire
 each
 month.


>> They
 expire.
 So
 my
 point
 is
 a
 perpetual


would
 not
 work
 in
 deliverable
 products.


So
 you
 say,
 well,
 what
 about
 cash
 settle


products,
 Terry?
 Would
 that
 work?
 I


don't
 know
 if
 they
 would
 work.
 They


would
 the
 index
 would
 continue
 to
 go,


but
 again,
 it
 would
 not
 fit
 the


definition
 under
 the
 law
 of
 a
 futures


contract
 because
 whether
 it's
 cash


settled
 or
 physical
 settled,
 the


definition
 is
 the
 exact
 same
 thing
 for
 a


futures
 contract.
 And
 it's
 not
 the


perpetual
 definition.
 Got
 it.


>> Let's
 talk
 some
 more
 general
 macro,
 I


guess.
 And
 we
 we
 touched
 on
 Treasury


futures
 earlier,
 which
 again
 big
 part
 of


your
 business.
 There's
 talk
 of
 another


potential
 government
 shutdown.
 I'm
 very


curious
 how
 you
 think
 about
 that.
 How


much
 of
 your
 time
 you
 spend
 thinking


about
 that
 possibility
 and
 what
 it
 means


for
 CME
 risk
 management?
 Or
 is
 it
 the


case
 that
 we've
 been
 here
 so
 many
 times


before?
 You
 kind
 of
 know
 what
 the


playbook
 is.


>> You
 always
 think
 you
 know
 what
 the


playbook
 is
 to
 some
 extent,
 Tracy.
 But


again,
 I
 think
 that
 if
 you
 the
 one
 time


that
 you
 apply
 that
 strategy
 and
 you
 go,


"Whoops,
 what
 do
 you
 mean
 it
 happened?"


You
 know,
 that's
 a
 problem,
 right?
 So,


you
 always
 have
 to
 be
 prepared
 and
 we


are.
 I
 think
 if
 there
 is
 a
 shutdown,


which
 I
 think
 there
 very
 likely
 could


be.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 the


shutdown
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


disturbance
 to
 the
 economy.
 I
 think
 it's


going
 to
 be
 a
 disturbance
 to
 parks
 and


recreations.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 uh
 some


of
 the
 other
 disturbances
 which
 this
 is


where
 it
 bothers
 me.
 Social
 services,


you
 know,
 that's
 a
 problem.
 But
 what


does
 that
 mean
 for
 the
 financial
 system?


Not
 so
 sure.
 But
 you
 know,
 people's


social
 security
 checks
 getting
 out
 on


time.
 Is
 that
 get
 delayed?
 That's
 a


problem.


>> Economic
 data
 getting
 reported
 in
 time.


>> I
 I
 think
 that
 when
 you
 look
 at
 they've


always
 kind
 of
 carved
 that
 economic
 data


out.


>> Okay.
 Yeah.
 with
 the
 USDA
 and
 other


entities,
 they've
 always
 gotten
 gotten


the
 data
 out
 through
 past
 shutdowns.
 And


I
 do
 think
 that
 the
 pressure
 to
 reopen


the
 government
 will
 be
 immense
 from
 both


sides
 of
 the
 aisle.
 So,
 they
 will
 have


to
 come
 to
 it.
 Even
 if
 it's
 a
 short


shutdown,
 I
 I
 don't
 see
 it
 being
 a
 long


one
 because
 of
 the
 reasons
 the
 the


social
 services
 that
 are
 so
 important
 to


so
 many
 constituents
 of
 Congress
 need
 to


have
 happen.
 You
 know,
 this
 actually


reminds
 me
 going
 back
 to
 the
 uh


different
 the
 varieties
 of
 event
 markets


and
 we
 talked
 about
 the
 political
 risks


which
 I
 find
 uh
 you
 know
 very
 compelling


especially
 at
 the
 small
 elections.
 There


are
 other
 things
 that
 are
 traded
 on


event
 markets
 that
 to
 my
 mind
 a
 a
 hedger


with
 a
 sort
 of
 economic
 stake
 might
 want


to
 hedge.
 So
 portfolio
 manager
 who
 might


be
 worried
 well
 what
 if
 we
 get
 a
 super


weak
 jobs
 print
 um
 that
 could
 really


bust
 my
 trade
 on
 these
 other
 prediction


markets
 you
 can
 bet
 is
 it
 going
 to
 be


over
 150
 is
 it
 going
 to
 be
 over
 200
 is


it
 going
 to
 be
 below
 100
 you
 could
 also


maybe
 a
 someone
 who's
 very
 bullish
 Tesla


for
 their
 robots
 division
 wants
 to
 is


bearish
 on
 the
 cars
 so
 I'm
 going
 to
 go


long
 Tesla
 but
 I
 want
 to
 short
 the


prediction
 market
 on
 their
 volume
 car


sales
 etc
 these
 are
 different
 than
 the


politics
 ones
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 they're


not
 as
 easy,
 manipulatable.
 They're


something
 else.
 How
 do
 you
 feel
 like


there
 seems
 to
 be
 some
 It
 strikes
 me


that
 there
 could
 be
 a
 real
 economic


justification
 for
 the
 existence
 of
 these


event
 markets?


>> I
 again,
 Joe,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 disagree


with
 what
 you
 just
 said
 because
 I
 I
 I


think
 that
 the
 more
 riskmanagement
 tools


we
 have
 is
 better.
 Yeah.


>> What
 you
 just
 described
 was
 risk


management.
 You
 did
 not
 describe
 a


gaming
 type
 scenario.
 You
 described
 a


company
 of
 Tesla
 that
 has
 multiple


divisions
 that
 you
 like
 one,
 but
 you're


a
 little
 worried
 about
 the
 production
 of


their
 cars.
 So,
 it
 it
 happens
 every


single
 day
 and
 it's
 been
 going
 on
 in
 the


market
 for
 100
 years.
 It's
 called
 parat


trading.
 So,
 you
 sell
 this
 and
 buy
 that,


right?
 Because
 you're
 not
 quite
 sure


when
 the
 event's
 going
 to
 happen,
 but


you
 know,
 let's
 all
 spread
 it
 up
 a


little
 bit.


>> It
 just
 seems
 to
 me
 that
 there's
 this


proliferation
 of
 possible
 tradable


events
 now
 in
 part
 because
 of
 these
 new


platforms.
 So
 you
 you
 know
 when
 we
 think


about
 hedging
 risk,
 maybe
 a
 big
 insurer


wanted
 to
 hedge
 out
 some
 interest
 rate


risk
 or
 something
 that
 makes
 sense,
 but


these
 new
 platforms
 are
 offering
 very


specific
 things
 like
 bet
 on
 the
 car


sales
 number
 or
 bet
 on
 the
 jobs
 number,


etc.
 Is
 that
 a
 space
 that
 you
 could
 see


again
 it's
 a
 risk
 management
 thing
 could


see
 me
 get
 into
 events
 such
 as
 that?


>> Again,
 I
 think
 when
 you
 look
 at
 specific


events
 that
 you
 just
 outlined,
 I'll
 use


Tesla.


>> Sure.
 to
 your
 example,
 I
 would
 have
 to


see
 what
 the
 interest
 is
 by
 the


participants
 because
 if
 you
 get
 a


contract
 that
 you
 list
 you,
 whether
 it's


a
 prediction
 market
 or
 a
 standardized


contract,
 and
 no
 one
 wants
 to
 trade
 it,


then
 it's
 it's
 an
 irrelevant
 contract


anyway,
 right?
 So,
 I
 like
 to
 say
 that,


and
 boy,
 I
 hope
 the
 people
 in
 Maine


don't
 hate
 me
 because
 I've
 used
 this


example
 a
 few
 times.
 There's
 people
 in


Maine
 that
 think
 you
 should
 have
 a


lobster
 futures
 contract,
 right?
 But
 you


know
 who
 wants
 that?
 People
 that
 are
 in


the
 lobster
 business.
 the
 rest
 of the


world
 doesn't
 care
 about
 that
 because
 we


can't
 afford
 lobster
 and
 we
 can
 we
 just


pay
 for
 it
 whatever
 the
 price
 is.
 So


there
 really
 isn't
 a
 marketplace
 there


for
 the
 speculators
 to
 participate
 in.


>> So
 is
 that
 the
 same
 situation
 with
 what


you
 outline?
 I'm
 not
 suggesting
 it
 is


but
 that's
 up
 to
 the
 participants.


That's
 why
 we
 we're
 very
 careful
 not
 to


put
 out
 products
 that
 we
 think
 that


there's
 no
 demand
 for.
 We
 we
 research


with


>> massive
 constituents
 about
 what
 they


think
 they
 need
 in
 order
 to
 manage
 risk.


Mhm.


>> And
 we're
 hearing
 different
 things
 now.


Does
 a
 product
 come
 out
 like
 a


prediction
 market
 where
 everybody
 goes,


"Aha,
 I
 finally
 found
 the
 holy
 grail
 on


how
 to
 lay
 off
 my
 risk."
 I
 don't
 see
 it.


I
 think
 the
 prediction
 markets
 that'll


be
 listed
 will
 be
 driven
 by
 the
 demand


of
 the
 participants,
 not
 the
 market


itself.
 Does
 that
 make
 sense
 to
 you?


>> Yeah.
 Very
 interesting.


>> I
 really
 want
 to
 launch
 a
 uh
 lobster


prediction
 market
 now.
 Lobster
 price


prediction.
 I
 think
 that'd
 be
 a
 really


interesting
 experiment.


There
 used
 to
 be
 a
 cardamom
 futures
 that


was
 traded
 in
 India
 and
 I
 tried
 reaching


out
 to
 the
 regulator.
 I
 wanted
 to
 do
 a


story
 about
 a
 dead
 futures
 contract
 that


didn't
 I
 couldn't
 get
 in.
 I
 got
 to
 try


again
 cuz
 you
 should
 try
 again.


>> Yeah.
 I'd
 love
 to
 like
 the
 story
 of
 a


futures
 contract
 that
 just
 lost.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Sort
 of
 on
 this
 note,
 do
 you
 see
 any


indication
 of
 big
 institutional


investors,
 I
 guess,
 taking
 some
 of
 the


the
 strategies
 that
 are
 deployed
 by


retail
 or
 sort
 of
 imitating
 retail
 in


some
 way.
 And
 what
 I
 mean
 by
 that
 is
 I


think
 about
 the
 one
 day
 zeroday
 options


when
 those
 first
 gained
 traction
 a
 lot


of
 the
 activity
 was
 through
 retail
 and


then
 the
 institutional
 sort
 of
 got


pulled
 in
 and
 got
 really
 into
 it.
 Is


there
 evidence
 of
 institutional
 becoming


more
 like
 retail
 in
 certain
 patterns
 of


behavior
 or
 certain
 interest
 in
 certain


products?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 there
 is
 always
 an


opportunity
 for
 big
 institutions
 to
 look


at
 what
 the
 retail
 is
 doing.
 So
 let


let's
 let's
 be
 mindful
 of
 where
 the


money
 comes
 from
 from
 institutions.
 So


if
 you
 put
 together
 a
 pool
 of
 dollars


and
 you
 give
 it
 to
 a
 a
 large


institution,
 they
 call
 it
 institutional


money
 that
 probably
 came
 from
 a
 subset


of
 the
 teachers
 union
 of
 a
 lot
 of


people.
 So
 everybody's
 got
 $10
 and
 this


all
 a
 sudden
 it's
 worth
 $und00
 million


or
 a
 billion
 dollars,
 whatever
 the
 case


is.
 So
 that
 retail
 money
 that's
 now
 big


is
 now
 called
 institutional
 money.
 So


their
 their
 thought
 processes
 aren't
 too


dissimilar
 from
 their
 clients.
 So
 yes,
 I


can
 see
 that
 going
 back
 and
 forth,


ebbing
 and
 flowing
 about
 the
 ideas
 of


what
 they
 want
 to
 participate
 in
 or
 not.


First
 of
 all,
 I
 think
 people
 are
 always


looking
 for
 opportunity.
 I
 think
 they're


always
 looking
 for
 efficiencies
 and
 I


think
 that
 the
 lines
 of
 institutional


and
 retail
 are
 absolutely
 blurred
 right


now.
 And
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people


going,
 "What
 does
 that
 mean?"
 I
 feel


like
 I've
 got
 some
 kind
 of
 handle
 on


that.
 And
 that's
 why
 I'm
 doing
 what
 I'm


doing
 because
 I
 think
 that
 the
 those


blurred
 lines
 will
 continue
 to
 go


forward
 and
 the
 products
 that
 they


participate
 in
 and
 how
 they
 do
 it
 will


continue
 to
 get
 blurred.
 I
 think
 both


can
 grow
 and
 they'll
 grow
 exponentially,


but
 they're
 going
 to
 look
 a
 lot
 alike.
 I


just
 have
 one
 last
 question
 and
 I
 feel


compelled
 to
 ask
 every
 CEO
 or
 really


every
 corporate
 executive
 this
 these


days
 with
 the
 exception
 of
 your
 software


engineers
 who
 work
 at
 uh
 CME
 right
 now.


Is
 there
 anything
 that
 you
 can
 point
 to


where
 large
 language
 models
 are
 being


deployed
 in
 a
 productive
 way
 within
 here


or
 is
 it
 still
 at
 test
 and
 see
 and
 do


experiments?


>> Okay,
 so
 let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 answer
 that


one,
 Joe.
 So
 large
 language
 models
 being


deployed.


>> Yeah,
 I'm
 sure
 the
 engineers
 are


generating
 code.
 So
 let's


>> Yeah,
 there's
 no
 question.
 But
 see,


we're
 we're
 kind
 of
 in
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 limbo,


for
 lack
 of
 a
 better
 term,
 spot
 right


now
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 stuff
 that
 I'm


working
 on
 is
 going
 through
 Google
 right


now
 because
 of
 the
 the
 relationship
 and


the
 partnership
 I
 have
 with
 Google.
 I'm


transitioning
 I'm
 going
 to
 transition
 my


markets
 to
 Google
 Cloud.
 I'm


transitioning
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 tech
 to
 Google


cloud
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 machine
 learning


and
 things
 of
 that
 nature
 Gemini
 and
 all


that
 we're
 going
 through
 Google
 so
 we


are
 doing
 it
 together
 so
 it's
 not
 just


my
 people
 doing
 anymore
 it's
 CME
 and


Google
 working
 together
 to
 deploy
 that


so
 I
 can't
 give
 you
 a
 singular
 answer


what
 we're
 doing
 as
 CME
 because
 it's


it's
 a
 mix
 between
 us


>> at
 the
 moment
 there's
 no
 workflow
 that


exists
 where
 someone
 could
 point
 and
 say


you
 know what
 this
 used
 to
 be
 a
 10erson


job
 but
 thanks
 to
 large
 language
 models


it's
 a
 one
 person
 job
 at least
 as
 of


September
 25
 2025


>> the
 only
 way
 I
 can
 answer
 that
 is
 by


headcount


>> okay


>> and
 I
 would
 say
 that
 that
 is
 not
 the


case
 because
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I've


seen
 with
 technology
 is
 it
 creates
 other


jobs
 and
 it
 eliminates
 the
 last
 job


>> so
 yes
 we
 have
 seen
 the
 elimination
 of


certain
 things
 to
 your
 point
 but
 it's


created
 other
 ones
 so
 I
 look
 at
 it
 as


headcount
 not
 so
 much
 as
 project
 uh


related


>> spoken
 like
 a
 former
 pit
 trader
 who


became
 the
 uh
 the
 CEO
 of
 a
 very
 large


derivatives
 exchange
 Can
 I
 squeeze
 in


one
 more
 question?
 This
 is
 backward


looking,
 but
 I
 am
 very
 interested
 in


hearing
 about
 it.
 Um,
 Liberation
 Day,


huge
 amount
 of
 market
 volatility.
 What


was
 that
 like
 for
 you?


>> Um,
 you
 know,
 just
 another
 day
 to
 be


honest
 with
 you.
 I
 hate
 to
 say
 it
 that


way,
 but
 we've
 seen
 so
 many
 different
 um


events
 in
 my
 career
 that,
 you
 know,
 when


you
 go
 back
 to
 the
 08
 crisis,
 you
 go


back
 to
 the
 flash
 crash,
 you
 go
 back
 to


other
 scenarios,
 the
 pandemic,
 you
 know,


I
 look
 at
 the
 pandemic
 as
 one
 of the


more
 the
 more
 frightening
 times
 in
 the


history
 of
 markets
 versus
 liberation


day.
 Liberation
 day
 is
 more
 about
 what


are
 the
 tariffs
 going
 to
 mean
 or
 not


mean.
 And
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 people
 that
 believe
 that
 there's


no
 way
 that
 these
 could
 come
 to


fruition.
 So,
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 tempered


down
 a
 little
 bit.
 The
 activity
 was


pretty
 exciting,
 but
 if
 that
 were
 to


come
 out
 of
 the
 blue,
 it
 it
 would
 be


really
 bizarre.
 But
 I
 think
 that
 was


fairly
 well
 telegraphed,
 Tracy,
 to
 say


the
 least,
 Liberation
 Day.
 So,
 I
 think


the
 market
 was
 well
 prepared
 for
 it.
 It


reminds
 me
 a
 lot
 of
 last
 week
 with
 the


Fed.


>> That
 was
 the
 most
 telegraphed
 quarter


point
 move
 in
 the
 history
 of
 the
 Federal


Reserve,
 right?
 Is
 that
 fair?
 I
 think


liberation
 day


nine
 5%
 moves
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 in
 a


row.


>> Okay.
 So
 when
 you
 look
 at
 percent
 of


stock
 market
 moves
 at
 the
 levels
 that


we're
 at
 today
 versus
 the
 percent
 of
 the


levels
 that
 we're
 at
 in
 '08
 it's
 it's
 a


non-event.
 So
 if
 we
 had
 8
 9%


>> everything
 based
 by
 2008
 is
 a
 non-event.


>> Okay.
 Therefore
 is
 all
 price
 anyway.


>> So
 I
 think
 it's
 relative
 to
 the
 value
 of


the
 product
 and
 the
 percent
 goes
 with


it.


>> What
 would
 worry
 you
 now?
 everything


worries
 me.


>> Oh,
 okay.


>> So,
 I
 don't
 have
 one
 particular
 thing.


So,
 you
 could
 say
 anything
 and
 I'd
 say,


"Yep,
 that
 worries
 me."
 So,
 but
 I
 I
 try


to
 uh
 manage
 it
 and
 move
 forward.
 And
 I


I
 I
 like
 to
 be,
 you
 know,
 telling
 my


people
 a
 couple
 different
 things.
 I
 I


love
 looking
 for
 I
 love
 the
 future.
 I


love
 young
 people.
 I
 think
 they're


innovative.
 I
 think
 they're


opportunities
 galore
 going
 forward.
 And


I
 like
 to
 use
 my
 past
 as
 something
 that


I
 learn
 from
 but
 not
 live
 in
 it.
 So,
 I


don't
 like
 to
 look
 through
 the
 rearview


mirror.
 I
 like
 to
 look
 through
 the


windshield
 and
 go
 forward.
 So,
 but
 when


you
 do
 that,
 you
 know,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


things
 that
 can
 scare
 you.
 We
 talked


about
 them
 earlier
 today.
 Some
 of
 the


new
 innovations
 that
 are
 coming
 out,


some
 will
 win,
 some
 will
 fail.
 So,
 you


have
 to
 be
 very
 careful
 about
 how
 we


participate
 in
 that
 as
 an
 institution


like
 CME.
 So,
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 that


concerns
 me.
 No
 different
 than
 when
 Sam


was
 uh
 you
 know
 putting
 forth
 with
 uh


FTX
 back
 in
 the
 day
 and
 he
 was
 backing


up
 his
 coins
 with
 synthetic
 other
 coins


and
 then
 he
 wanted
 to
 have
 a
 margining


system
 with
 no
 risk
 management
 that
 that


was
 fraught
 with
 danger
 and
 I
 saw
 that


but
 it
 seemed
 like
 nobody
 else
 did.
 I'm


not
 suggesting
 that's
 today's
 world,
 but


there
 seems
 to
 be
 uh
 a
 situation
 right


now
 with
 regulatory
 issues
 where,
 you


know,
 go
 ahead
 and
 do
 it
 and
 we'll


apologize
 later
 is
 the
 old
 saying,


whatever
 it
 is.
 And
 and
 that's
 not
 a


good
 place
 to
 be.
 So,
 that
 worries
 me
 a


little
 bit,
 Tracy.


>> All
 right,
 Terry
 Duffy,
 always
 good


chatting
 with
 you.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


coming
 back
 on
 the
 show.


>> Thanks,
 Tracy.
 Thanks,
 Joe.
 That


>> was
 a
 blast.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much.
 So
 much


fun.


[Music]


Joe,
 Terry's
 a
 blast.
 I


>> I
 love
 talking
 to
 Terry.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 I'm
 glad
 we
 did
 it
 though


because
 I
 think
 if
 you're
 thinking
 about


the
 intersection
 of
 the
 sort
 of


prediction
 betting
 markets
 and
 the
 sort


of
 old
 school
 traditional
 markets,
 the


CME,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of
 stands
 out.


>> It's
 right
 there.
 Yeah.
 I
 thought
 I


really
 I
 really
 liked
 his
 point
 about


2017
 was
 by
 some


by
 many
 measures
 very
 late
 to
 the
 crypto


game.
 Maybe
 I
 mean
 I
 guess
 we
 don't
 know


in
 100
 years
 from
 now
 maybe
 that'll


still
 be
 seen
 as
 day
 one
 but
 it's
 been
 a


successful
 business
 for
 the
 CME
 and
 so


this
 idea
 that
 the
 long-term


you
 know
 one
 way
 to
 think
 about
 the


long-term
 value
 creation
 of
 the
 CME
 is


that
 it's
 okay
 to
 be
 second
 that
 doesn't


need
 to
 rush
 out
 of
 the
 gate
 for
 some
 of


these
 things.
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 a
 very


compelling
 example,


>> right?
 And
 there,
 you
 know,
 there
 is


first
 mover
 advantage,
 but
 on
 the
 other


hand,
 there
 is
 also
 institutional
 um


strength
 that
 can
 be
 an
 advantage
 as


well.


>> FTX
 said
 first
 mover
 advantage.
 It
 sort


of
 was
 missing
 the
 latter
 one,
 and
 that


was
 proved
 to
 be
 very
 costly.


>> I
 think
 that
 was
 Terry's
 point,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 super
 old-fashioned


when
 it
 comes
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 betting


markets,
 but
 one
 of the
 things
 you
 hear


is
 that
 when
 you
 think
 about
 traditional


financial
 assets,
 it's
 about
 putting


money
 to
 good
 use,
 right?
 you
 know,
 you


invest
 in
 something,
 you're
 supposed
 to


get
 an
 income
 stream
 back
 or
 maybe
 an


asset
 that
 appreciates
 over
 time,
 but


again,
 probably
 one
 that
 generates
 some


sort
 of
 income.
 I
 do
 I
 I
 look
 at
 the


activity
 on
 all
 of
 these
 betting


platforms
 and
 like,
 you
 know,


marketmaking
 platforms
 and
 things
 like


that
 and
 I
 just
 think
 there's
 so
 much


money
 being
 generated
 and
 I'm
 not
 sure


like


>> where
 it's
 going.
 Do
 you
 know
 what
 I


mean?


>> Yeah.
 There's
 so
 much
 going
 on
 right
 now


and
 like
 it
 just
 feels
 like
 there's
 a


complete
 blurring
 of
 everything,
 a


complete
 transformation
 of
 everything.


It
 really
 does
 feel
 like
 to
 me


specifically
 the
 doors
 are
 being
 flung


open.
 There
 is
 this
 sort
 of
 growing
 norm


in
 society
 that
 anyone
 can
 trade


anything
 at
 any
 time
 for
 better
 or


worse.
 I
 make
 no
 judgment
 on
 it.
 I
 do


think
 you
 know


it
 is
 interesting
 to
 me
 one
 to
 CME


specifically


>> this
 sort
 of
 like
 caution
 where
 you
 know


let's
 let's
 take
 this
 stuff
 seriously


not
 necessarily
 dismissing


on
 the
 other
 hand
 like
 when
 CME
 like


partners
 with
 FanDuel
 and
 which
 is
 like


a
 literal
 sports
 betting
 company
 it


strikes
 me
 that
 that
 is
 an
 accelerating


event
 for
 this
 world
 where
 we
 just
 trade


on
 everything
 that
 you
 can
 talk
 about


caution
 but
 like
 when
 you're
 like
 you


know
 partnering
 with
 a
 straightup
 sports


betting
 company
 even
 if
 it's
 on
 a


different
 app
 etc
 that
 you're


accelerating
 this
 world
 of
 everything
 is


a
 bet
 on
 any
 on
 any
 app


>> on
 the
 plus
 side
 lots
 of
 content
 for


good
 odds
 episodes


>> and
 one
 other
 thing
 yes
 and
 we
 have
 many


more
 like
 this
 is
 like
 perfect
 timing


this
 trip
 and
 everything
 because
 there


is
 so
 much
 going
 on
 there's
 that
 round


table
 I
 really
 like
 Terry's
 point
 about


the
 and
 even
 if
 you
 said
 it
 as
 kind
 of
 a


joke
 about
 the
 lobster
 futures
 because
 I


do
 think
 that's
 very
 telling
 right
 you


could
 imagine
 in
 that
 lobstermen
 might


like
 to
 hedge
 their
 prices,
 but
 that


there's
 just
 not
 going
 to
 be
 enough


volume
 or
 real
 market
 for
 it.
 And
 I
 do


think
 that's
 interesting
 to
 keep
 in
 mind


because
 I
 do
 look
 at
 some
 of
 these


contracts
 that
 exist
 on
 the
 other


platforms
 and
 like
 I
 could
 see
 a
 entity


wanting
 to
 hedge
 out
 the
 risk
 of
 a
 very


left
 tail
 jobs
 report
 or
 I
 could
 see


wanting
 to
 hedge
 out
 the
 car
 sales
 risk


of
 Tesla.
 The
 logic
 of
 the
 market
 does


not
 necessarily
 mean
 that
 there
 will
 be


a
 sizable
 market.
 I
 think
 is
 a
 very


important
 one
 to
 keep
 in
 mind.


>> But
 I
 also
 wonder
 if
 you
 wouldn't
 have


the
 same
 market
 size
 issues
 for


something
 like
 a
 lobster
 prediction


market.
 Like
 who
 Well,


>> well,
 yeah.
 I
 do
 think
 we
 don't
 know.


>> No,
 no,
 no.
 I
 It
 just
 throws
 up
 all


these
 really
 interesting
 questions
 and
 I


do
 think
 maybe
 we
 should
 start
 one
 and


then
 talk
 about
 what
 we
 learned
 from
 it.


>> Let's
 do
 it.


>> Okay,

 next

 Thoughts

 Uh,
