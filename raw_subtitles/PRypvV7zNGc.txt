Hi
 everyone.
 Uh
 welcome
 to
 this
 podcast


with
 uh
 my
 special
 guest
 Oscar
 Krberg.


Um
 he's
 a
 adjunct
 professor
 teaching
 at


NYU
 business
 school
 and
 uh
 he
 is
 also


the
 author
 of
 uh
 what
 you
 should
 know


about
 Chinese
 economics
 and
 highly


recommend
 that
 book
 and
 uh
 uh
 today
 it's


a
 great
 honor
 to
 have
 you
 here
 in
 my


podcast
 author.


>> Yeah,
 very
 glad
 to
 be
 here.
 Thanks
 so


much.


>> Yeah.
 So
 uh
 first
 uh
 question
 I
 have
 is


for
 you
 is
 um
 I'm
 really
 interested
 like


how
 did
 you
 get
 into
 this
 field
 of
 study


like
 Chinese
 economics
 like
 uh
 what
 made


you
 like
 uh
 be
 interested
 in
 this
 topic?


>> It
 basic
 yeah
 I
 I
 basically
 got
 into
 it


by
 complete
 accident.


>> Uh
 so
 uh
 at
 university
 I
 had
 nothing
 I


studied
 nothing
 related
 to
 economics.


>> Uh
 my
 major
 was
 actually
 comparative


religion.
 I
 was
 interested
 in
 ancient


Buddhism.
 and
 things
 like
 that.
 Um
 and


um
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 know
 my
 coursework


looking
 at
 Asia
 so
 India
 and
 China
 both


but
 from
 a
 you
 know
 not
 from
 a
 modern


history
 or
 uh
 politics
 or
 economic


standpoint.
 Um
 and
 then
 I
 went
 into


journalism
 after
 that
 and
 was
 a


freelance
 uh
 writer
 for
 newspapers
 and


technical
 publications
 for
 for
 a
 number


of
 years.
 Um
 and
 um
 I
 wound
 up
 um


traveling
 a
 lot
 in
 Asia
 because
 my
 wife


at
 the
 time
 was
 a
 um
 US
 diplomat


>> uh
 was
 assigned
 first
 to
 India
 uh
 and


later
 several
 times
 to
 China.
 uh
 and


when
 we
 were
 living
 in
 India
 in
 the
 late


80s,
 I
 started
 to
 perceive
 that
 um
 a
 lot


of
 the
 political
 discussions


there
 had
 kind
 of
 economic
 underpinnings


that
 people
 weren't
 paying
 that
 much


attention
 to.
 uh
 so
 I
 started
 to
 get


interested
 in
 economics
 and
 when
 we


moved
 to
 China
 in
 the
 early
 90s
 it
 was


right
 about
 the
 time
 that
 Dunia


had
 launched
 his
 nonshin
 which
 resto
 uh


restarted
 reform
 uh
 after
 the


uh
 lapse


>> um
 and
 so
 it's
 very
 interesting
 time
 to


be
 in
 China
 uh
 to
 witness
 the


transformations
 that
 were
 going
 on
 in


the
 economy
 and
 the
 business
 environment


uh
 and
 I
 kind
 of
 got
 hooked
 um
 so
 after


doing
 that
 for
 a
 number
 of
 years
 on
 a


freelance
 basis.
 I
 set
 up
 a
 company
 in


Beijing
 in
 2002
 to,
 you
 know,
 do
 a
 more


formal
 um
 uh
 be
 able
 to
 study
 the


Chinese
 economy
 more
 formally.
 Uh
 and


that's,
 you
 know,
 that's
 where
 it's


where
 I've
 been
 for
 the
 last
 almost
 a


quarter
 century.


>> Awesome.
 Like
 what
 kind
 of
 um
 lead
 you


to
 write
 that
 book?
 I
 really
 like
 your


book
 and
 to
 be
 honest
 like
 the
 the
 first


time
 I
 saw
 your
 book
 I
 read
 it
 this
 is


the
 first
 book
 I
 read
 about
 Chinese


economics
 without
 too
 much
 emphasize
 on


ideology
 you
 know
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 books


right
 around
 like
 either
 in
 English
 or


Chinese
 you're
 either
 pro
 the
 CCP
 regime


or
 you're
 against
 it
 like
 there's
 no


balanced
 view
 like


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So
 what
 led
 me
 to
 to
 uh
 to


write
 it
 was
 well
 I
 was
 I
 was
 um
 invited


by
 the
 publisher
 Oxford
 um
 to
 write
 the


volume.
 They
 they
 were
 interested
 in


doing
 something
 in
 the
 Chinese
 economy


and
 a
 number
 of
 my
 professional
 economic


academic
 friends
 recommended
 me.
 Um
 and


you
 know
 basically
 what
 what
 I
 and
 the


editor
 felt
 was
 that
 there
 was
 a
 a
 gap


in
 the
 market.
 there
 was
 a
 need
 for
 a


book
 that
 would
 simply
 describe
 how


China
 had
 gotten
 to
 where
 it
 was


>> and
 this
 was
 around
 2015.
 So,
 uh
 it
 had


risen
 quite
 a
 lot,
 but
 it's
 not
 um


obviously
 a
 lot
 has
 happened
 since
 then.


>> Um
 yeah,
 so
 there
 was
 a
 there
 was
 a
 need


for
 a
 book
 that
 um
 would
 describe
 China,


you
 know,
 how
 it
 got
 to
 where
 it
 was
 in


a
 in
 a
 way
 that
 was


sort
 of
 normal
 people
 could
 understand.


So
 it
 was
 not
 intended
 to
 be
 a
 book
 for


specialists.
 Um,
 so
 less
 technical
 but


also


uh
 just
 very
 straight
 and
 as
 you
 say
 non


ideological
 and
 that's
 you
 know
 I
 think


that's
 what
 the
 publisher
 wanted
 and


that's
 what
 I
 wanted
 to
 write
 because
 I


agree
 with
 you
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 discussion


about
 China
 Chinese
 economy
 and
 what's


going
 on
 there


basically
 winds
 up
 being
 a
 debate
 about


its
 political
 system
 and
 people


>> exactly


>> smuggle
 political
 arguments
 into


discussion
 economics
 and
 you
 know
 it's


it's
 perfectly
 reasonable
 to
 debate


China's
 political
 system.
 That's
 a


that's
 a
 worthy
 topic
 of
 conversation.


Um
 but
 uh
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 economic


discussions
 particularly
 in
 the
 more


popular
 media
 get
 polluted
 by
 political


assumptions
 that
 people
 don't
 really


question.
 So
 my
 standpoint
 throughout
 my


career
 has
 always
 been
 to
 be
 to
 to


downplay
 the
 ideology


um
 and
 try
 and
 just
 be
 data
 driven
 and


and
 look
 at
 at
 the
 facts.
 And
 you
 know,


one
 of
 my
 one
 of
 my
 mantras
 is
 that


economics
 is
 not
 a
 morality
 play.


>> Exactly.
 I
 totally
 agree.


>> What
 happens
 in
 economics
 is,
 you
 know,


has
 a
 lot
 of
 implications
 for
 societies


and
 how
 they're
 structured
 and
 so
 forth.


And
 um,
 you
 know,
 those
 need
 to
 be
 taken


into
 account,
 but
 economic
 forces


themselves
 are
 are
 distinct
 from
 from
 a


from
 a
 sort
 of
 moral
 discussion.
 and


it's
 possible
 to
 evaluate
 an
 economy
 on


its
 own
 merits
 without
 getting
 into
 a


bunch
 of
 value
 judgments.
 Um,
 so
 that's


what
 I
 generally
 try
 to
 do.


>> Yeah.
 So
 by
 that
 time
 when
 you
 start
 to


write
 that
 book,
 uh,
 how
 many
 years


you've
 been
 living
 in
 China
 or
 like


maybe
 visiting
 China
 and
 doing


observations?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 first
 moved
 to
 China
 in


1991
 and
 I
 lived
 there
 mostly
 uh,


full-time
 until
 2016.
 So
 I'd
 been
 there,


you
 know,
 about
 a
 quarter
 century.
 some


gaps
 in
 there
 but
 was
 most
 of
 it
 and


then
 I
 was
 half
 and
 half
 in
 China
 in
 the


US
 until
 about
 2020
 and
 then
 since
 then


I've
 mainly
 been
 living
 in
 New
 York.


>> Got
 it.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 So
 now
 I'm
 going
 to


dive
 in
 the
 first
 question.
 You
 know
 you


see
 the
 screen
 here.
 Uh
 this
 uh


professor
 his
 name
 is
 Chinuay.
 So
 he's


uh
 from
 a
 top
 university
 in
 China
 like


he
 teach
 history
 there.
 So
 economics
 not


his
 major
 like
 focus.
 But
 recently
 he


did
 a
 podcast
 and
 he
 basically
 argued


that
 the
 Chinese
 uh
 economics
 uh
 growth


in
 the
 past
 like
 30
 years
 I
 would
 say


like
 after
 the
 you
 know
 tenia
 changed


the
 policy
 it's
 primarily
 due
 to
 the
 low


human
 rights
 advantage
 that's
 his
 core


argument
 he
 thinks
 that
 like
 China's


system
 is
 artificially
 lower
 the
 factor


cost
 by
 surprising
 the
 rights
 especially


like
 you
 ban
 those
 independent
 unions


you
 cannot
 easily
 form
 a
 labor
 union
 to


negotiate
 your
 wages
 and
 also
 So
 the


government
 can
 seize
 the
 land
 without


any
 fair
 compensation
 which
 happens
 a


lot
 like
 20
 years
 ago
 I'll
 say.
 So
 this


is
 like
 similar
 to
 how
 the
 slave
 holding


south
 out
 compete
 the
 north
 in
 America


pre
 the
 civil
 war
 America.
 Do
 you
 agree


or
 disagree
 with
 that
 kind
 of
 argument?


Well,
 I
 agree
 with
 it
 part
 with
 part
 of


it,
 right?
 And
 I
 think
 uh
 Shinu
 is
 a


very
 insightful
 scholar
 and
 I
 I
 think


has
 uh
 you
 know
 very
 very
 good


observations
 on


>> um
 you
 know
 how
 China
 works.
 And
 I
 what


I
 would
 agree
 with
 is
 there's
 no


question
 that
 the
 Chinese
 economic
 model


depends
 on
 a
 lot
 of


um
 efforts
 by
 the
 state
 to
 repress


certain
 costs,
 right?
 And
 so
 I
 think
 the


the
 point
 about
 uh
 labor
 unions
 uh
 and


and
 just
 sort
 of
 labor
 policy
 generally


is
 absolutely
 correct.
 So
 essentially


starting
 in
 the
 80s
 they
 set
 up
 a
 system


where
 labor
 was
 free
 to
 move
 into
 the


cities
 which
 it
 had
 not
 been
 able
 to
 do


during
 the
 Mau
 area
 when
 the
 cities
 in


the
 countryside
 were
 strictly


segregated.


>> So
 you
 if
 you
 wanted
 to
 work
 in
 a
 city


you
 could
 move
 there
 but
 you
 didn't
 gain


any
 civil
 rights
 in
 that
 city.
 didn't


gain
 access
 to
 the
 local
 pension
 system


or
 the
 welfare
 system
 or
 anything.
 Uh


and
 so
 it
 created
 a
 certain
 kind
 of
 um


instability
 or
 insecurity.
 Um


uh
 and
 it
 it
 tended
 to
 lower
 the
 cost


because
 the
 localities
 that
 were
 doing


the
 hiring
 didn't
 really
 have
 to
 bull


the
 bear
 the
 full
 social
 burden
 in
 terms


of
 social
 welfare
 and
 so
 forth
 of
 of
 uh


hiring
 these
 people.
 um
 and
 the


prohibition
 on
 independent
 labor
 union


organization
 and
 other
 things
 indeed
 I


think
 has
 um
 you
 know
 tilted
 the
 balance


in
 in
 China
 over
 the
 last
 few
 decades
 in


favor
 of
 capital
 uh
 at
 the
 expense
 of


labor
 to
 some
 degree.


>> Uh
 so
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 true.
 Uh
 you
 can


look
 at
 you
 can
 look
 at
 other
 things
 you


know
 um
 a
 commonly
 cited
 thing
 is
 um
 you


know
 environmental
 compliance
 costs


costs
 in
 China
 for
 many
 years
 were
 way


lower
 than
 elsewhere.
 they
 were
 willing


to
 uh
 sustain
 higher
 levels
 of


pollution.
 That's
 normal,
 you
 know,
 in


pretty
 much
 every
 developing
 economy.


That's
 not
 unique
 to
 China.


>> But
 then
 the
 other
 thing
 is
 financial


repression.


>> Uh
 and
 so
 the
 government
 basically


controls
 the
 financial
 system,


determines
 where
 things
 can
 be
 invested


um
 and
 um
 um
 and
 is
 able
 to
 keep
 the


cost
 of
 financing
 pretty
 low.
 And
 so


again,
 that
 is
 a
 benefit
 for
 for


capital.
 So
 I
 would
 agree
 with
 those


elements
 of
 the
 argument.
 Where
 I
 would


disagree
 is
 that
 you
 could
 compare
 this


in
 any
 way
 to
 the
 the
 southern
 United


States
 pre-
 civil
 war
 or
 anything
 like


that
 because
 the
 other
 part
 of
 what
 was


going
 on
 was
 an
 intensely
 competitive


um
 uh
 industrial
 system
 and
 it
 was
 in


competitive
 in
 two
 ways.
 Mhm.


>> One
 that
 was
 there's
 a
 very
 fiercely


competitive
 domestic
 market
 where
 yeah,


you
 can
 get
 your
 cheap
 inputs
 and
 so


forth,
 but
 then
 you
 have
 to
 compete


against
 all
 the
 other
 companies
 that
 are


also
 getting
 those
 cheap
 inputs
 and
 the


state
 generally
 speaking
 is
 not
 going
 to


um
 guarantee
 success
 to
 to
 any
 one


actor.
 Uh
 so
 in
 order
 to
 survive
 in
 that


environment
 you
 have
 to
 have
 something


other
 than
 cheap
 input
 costs
 because


everyone
 else
 has
 the
 same
 input
 costs.


>> Correct.


>> And
 then
 second
 uh
 they
 focused
 on


export
 oriented
 manufacturing.
 Um
 and


the
 point
 there
 is
 that
 every
 successful


development
 story
 Japan,
 South
 Korea,


Taiwan,


um
 uh
 Germany
 after
 World
 War
 II,
 uh
 has


depended
 on
 exportoriented
 manufacturing


as
 a
 way
 of
 stimulating,
 you
 know,


technological
 upgrading.
 And
 you
 could


say,
 well,
 okay,
 these
 these
 things
 gave


China
 an
 unfair
 advantage
 in
 global


markets,
 and
 that's
 I
 think
 partly
 true,


but
 it's
 also
 definitely
 true
 that


because
 of
 the
 need
 to
 export
 and
 the


need
 to
 compete
 in
 the
 in
 the
 domestic


economy,
 the
 companies
 got
 very


innovative.
 And
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 China's


growth
 is
 coming
 from
 that
 that


innovation
 and
 that
 technological


upgrading,
 not
 just
 from
 cheap
 inputs.


Mhm.
 And
 also
 I
 think
 especially


nowadays
 like
 China
 is
 no
 longer
 the


cheapest
 labor
 market.
 You
 know
 like
 you


get
 much
 cheaper
 labor
 from
 other
 like


South
 Asian
 countries
 but
 still
 China


still
 dominates
 in
 certain
 manufacturing


areas.


>> Yeah
 that's
 absolutely
 correct
 because


what
 China
 has
 been
 able
 to
 do
 is
 yeah


they
 have
 the
 cheap
 inputs
 but
 they
 also


have
 first
 class
 infrastructure
 and
 they


have
 for
 many
 years.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 and
 very
 few
 countries
 have
 both


lower
 labor
 costs
 and
 first
 quality
 uh


infrastructure.
 And
 now
 I
 think
 what


you're
 seeing
 today
 is
 that
 the
 benefits


of
 creating
 this
 very
 large
 um


manufacturing
 ecosystem
 where
 you
 can


scale
 up
 products
 very
 quickly
 are
 are


coming
 to
 to
 fruition.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 yeah,
 cheap
 inputs
 definitely
 part
 of


the
 story
 but
 but
 but
 only
 a
 part


>> only
 a
 part.
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 kind


of
 uh
 see
 the
 similarity.
 I
 think
 like


both
 China
 and
 US
 have
 this
 kind
 of


similar
 dual
 citizenship
 um
 status
 like


you
 know
 in
 US
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 um
 they


call
 it
 illegal
 im
 uh
 illegal
 immigrants


or
 like
 you
 know
 like
 im
 immigrants


without
 any
 legal
 status
 for
 that
 type


of
 person
 they
 contribute
 to
 a
 lot
 of


like
 lower
 cost
 service
 and
 goods


provided
 in
 US
 market
 but
 the
 US


government
 don't
 have
 to
 cover
 their
 any


social
 welfare
 in
 China
 you
 have
 that


similar
 similarity,
 right?


>> Well,
 yeah,
 this
 is,
 I
 think,
 a
 great


example
 of
 where
 it's
 easy
 to
 fall
 into


false
 equivalence.
 So,


>> yes,
 both
 of
 those
 things
 exist,
 but
 the


scale
 is
 completely
 different.
 So
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 United
 States,
 I
 think
 the


the
 total
 foreignb
 born
 population
 in


the
 United
 States
 is
 I
 think
 about
 25%


of
 the
 total
 population.


>> And
 you
 know
 the
 vast
 majority
 of
 those


people
 are
 documented
 and
 um
 you
 know


have
 full
 legal
 rights.
 And
 so
 I
 I
 don't


know
 exactly
 what
 the
 undocumented


uh
 immigrant
 uh
 population
 is,
 but
 I


would
 venture
 to
 guess
 it's
 probably,


you
 know,
 on
 the
 order
 of
 3
 or
 4%
 at


most
 of
 the
 total
 workforce.
 In
 China,


it
 is
 still
 the
 case
 that
 onethird
 of


the
 population
 of
 urban
 China
 and
 the


population
 of
 urban
 China
 is
 about
 800


million
 people.


onethird
 of
 those
 people
 do
 not
 have


full
 UKO
 or
 residence
 rights.


>> Um
 so
 the
 the
 number
 of
 people
 um
 uh
 in


China
 who
 are
 in
 this
 kind
 of
 secondass


labor
 situation
 is
 a
 population
 greater


than
 the
 entire
 population
 of
 the
 United


States.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 and
 and
 on
 a
 workforce
 basis,


you
 know,
 it's
 probably
 equal
 to
 the


entire
 equal
 to
 or
 greater
 than
 the


entire
 labor
 force
 of
 the
 United
 States.


>> And
 as
 a
 share
 of
 China's
 work


workforce,
 it
 is
 very
 very
 large.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 so
 yes,
 this
 phenomenon
 does
 exist
 to


some
 degree
 in
 the
 United
 States,
 but


it's
 tiny,
 whereas
 in
 China,
 it's


absolutely
 central.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


where
 Chin
 has
 a
 good
 point
 that
 this


was
 this
 was
 not
 just
 some


um
 incidental
 part
 of
 the
 uh
 development


process.
 It
 was
 pretty
 central
 for
 a


very
 long
 time.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.
 Then
 uh
 the
 second
 question


becomes
 very
 interesting
 like
 a
 lot
 of


people
 kind
 of
 argue
 like
 the
 current


Chinese
 um
 debt
 problem
 you
 know
 like


the
 economic
 downturn
 a
 lot
 of
 people


analyze
 it
 to
 uh
 similar
 to
 Japan
 what


happened
 like
 after
 their
 uh
 real
 estate


bubble
 um
 burst
 but
 also
 uh
 another


scholar
 he's
 also
 a
 very
 reputable
 one


uh
 in
 US
 uh
 professor
 Shu
 he
 argued
 that


like
 China's
 current
 situation
 is
 like


the
 Soviet
 union
 in
 the
 70s.
 uh
 the


argument
 he
 had
 is
 like
 you
 know
 um


China
 doesn't
 have
 those
 like


independent
 labor
 union
 or
 any


collective
 bargaining
 rights
 and
 also


you
 have
 this
 uh
 government
 that's
 like


cannot
 really
 pivot
 to
 the
 consumption


model
 and
 really
 hitting
 uh
 they
 call
 it


I
 don't
 I
 don't
 like
 institutional


ceilings
 like
 in
 the
 system
 it's
 it's
 a


hard
 institutional
 ceiling
 instead
 of


just
 like
 hitting
 a
 market
 cycle
 and


that's
 why
 he
 argued
 that
 the
 political


system
 if
 not
 really
 fully
 reformed
 is


going
 to
 exhaust
 all
 the
 economic


potential
 and
 really
 kind
 of
 suppress


efficiency
 now
 like
 do
 you
 think
 his


argument
 I
 I
 know
 it's
 a
 little
 bit


tilted
 towards
 ideological
 part
 but
 like


do
 you
 think
 his
 argument
 is
 correct
 or


his
 uh
 analogy
 is
 like
 a
 reasonable


>> yeah
 well
 if
 you
 if
 you
 don't
 mind
 me


taking
 a
 little
 while
 I
 want
 to
 address


both
 these
 two
 comparisons
 separately


the
 balance
 sheet
 recession
 one
 and
 the


institution
 ceiling
 one


>> because
 they're
 both
 pretty
 widespread


and
 it's
 understandable
 why
 why
 people


you
 know
 uh
 support
 them.
 I
 I
 don't


really
 disagree
 I
 don't
 really
 agree


with
 either
 one
 of
 them.
 So
 um
 and
 you


know
 so
 fundamentally
 I
 think
 that
 China


is
 a
 much
 more
 dynamic
 and
 resilient


system
 than
 either
 Japan
 of
 the
 90s
 or


the
 Soviet
 Union
 in
 its
 late
 era
 and
 so


its
 prospects


um
 are
 are
 much
 stronger.
 So
 let
 me


explain
 why.
 Mhm.


>> So,
 Japan
 um
 this
 was
 a
 comparison
 that


was
 common
 among
 western
 economists
 two


or
 three
 years
 ago
 when
 China
 had
 a
 very


anemic
 uh
 recovery
 from
 the
 COVID


pandemic.
 Um
 and
 you
 know
 the
 debt


problems
 of
 the
 local
 governments
 and
 um


the
 state
 enterprises
 became
 you
 know


very
 prominent.
 Um
 and
 so
 the
 idea
 was


look
 you
 know
 Japan
 in
 1990
 they
 they


had
 a
 lot
 of
 debt.
 They
 had
 a
 big
 real


estate
 collapse.
 The
 economy
 stagnated


for
 about
 15
 years.
 It
 took
 a
 lost


decade
 of
 very
 low
 growth
 and
 deflation.


And
 China
 according
 to
 some
 people
 was,


you
 know,
 basically
 headed
 to
 the
 same


thing.
 Um,
 and
 I
 thought
 this
 was
 wrong


for
 several
 reasons.
 The
 the
 central
 one


is
 that
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 financial


structure
 of
 Japan
 circa
 1990,
 it
 had


what
 I
 would
 call
 a
 unified
 national


balance
 sheet.
 Mhm.


>> Uh
 which
 is
 to
 say
 that
 financial


companies
 banks
 owned
 equity
 in


industrial
 companies.
 Industrial


companies
 owned
 equity
 in
 the
 banks.
 So


there
 were
 these
 cross
 shareholdings.


And
 when
 times
 were
 good,
 this
 was
 very


beneficial
 because
 the
 industrial


companies
 could
 get
 cheap
 finance
 and
 so


forth.
 Um


>> but
 at
 the
 bottom
 of
 all
 of
 this
 unified


balance
 sheet
 was
 land
 values
 that
 had


just
 exploded.
 So
 land
 values
 in
 in
 um


Japan
 increased
 by
 about
 600%
 during
 the


1980s.
 And
 by
 1990,
 it
 was
 common
 to


value
 Japanese
 companies
 not
 by
 their


profits
 or
 what
 they
 did,
 but
 how
 much


land
 they
 own
 and
 how
 much
 that
 land
 was


worth,
 right?
 Um
 and
 so
 the
 problem
 was


that
 those
 land
 values
 had
 just
 been


propped
 up
 by
 a
 financial
 bubble.
 And


when
 they
 collapsed
 and
 ultimately
 they


failed
 by
 about
 80%.
 What
 that
 meant
 is


that
 the
 equity
 value
 not
 only
 of


industrial
 companies
 but
 also
 the
 entire


financial
 sector
 also
 shrank
 because


everything
 was
 built
 on
 this
 this
 um
 uh


basis
 of
 land
 values.
 And
 when
 the


industrial
 companies
 collapsed,
 the
 the


financial
 companies
 also
 uh
 collapsed


because
 much
 of
 their
 um
 value
 was
 in


the
 shares
 that
 they
 owned
 in
 the


industrial
 companies.
 So
 everyone
 was


tied
 together
 and
 they
 all
 sank


together.
 China
 has
 never
 allowed
 that.


They've
 never
 allowed
 cross


shareholdings
 between
 industry
 and
 banks


precisely
 for
 this
 reason.
 They
 saw
 that


problem.
 They
 saw
 problem
 similar


problems
 in
 Korea.
 They
 said
 never
 let


that
 happen
 here.
 So
 yeah,
 you
 wound
 up


with
 a
 real
 estate
 bust
 in
 China
 since


2020.
 And
 that's
 bad
 for
 the
 real
 estate


developers.
 It's
 bad
 for
 the
 local


governments.
 Uh
 it
 basically
 has
 very


little
 impact
 on
 the
 financial
 system.


Uh
 particularly
 the
 big
 systemic
 banks


who
 did
 not
 have
 large
 real
 estate


exposures
 and
 it
 had
 zero
 impact
 on
 the


the
 tech
 companies,
 you
 know,
 the
 the


Huawei's
 and
 the
 BYDs
 of
 the
 world.
 uh


they
 were
 totally
 unaffected
 and
 so
 they


could
 invest
 massively.
 Uh
 and
 so
 if
 you


look
 at
 what
 happened
 in
 Japan
 in
 the


1990s
 was
 that
 there
 was
 a
 collapse
 in


investment
 across
 the
 board.
 In
 China,


what
 you
 saw
 after
 2020
 was
 a
 collapse


in
 investment
 in
 real
 estate
 and
 a


gigantic
 boom
 in
 investment
 in


manufacturing.
 So
 it's
 a
 completely


different
 dynamic
 and
 has
 led
 to
 a
 much


more
 positive
 result.
 So
 that's
 I
 think


the
 central
 difference
 between
 China
 and


Japan.


The
 Soviet
 institutional
 ceiling


argument
 is
 sort
 of
 a
 repackaging


of
 an
 argument
 that
 has
 been
 around
 for


basically
 as
 long
 as
 I
 have
 been
 going


to
 China.
 And
 I
 first
 went
 to
 China
 in


1985


>> as
 a
 tourist.


And
 since
 the
 beginning
 of
 reforms
 in


the
 1980s,
 people
 have
 said,


>> look,
 you've
 got
 this
 dynamic,
 you
 know,


re
 somewhat
 capitalist
 economy
 with
 a


big
 private
 sector
 and
 you
 have
 this


Leninist
 authoritarian
 centralized


government
 on
 top.
 These
 two
 things
 are


fundamentally
 incompatible
 and
 one
 of


them
 is
 going
 to
 break.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 for
 a
 long
 time
 people


said,
 well
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 is
 the


economic
 system
 will
 break
 the
 political


system
 and
 they'll
 have
 to
 do
 political


reform.
 And
 you
 know
 the
 the


counterargument
 has
 always
 been
 no
 that


the
 political
 system
 will
 strangle
 the


economy
 and
 they'll
 stop
 growing,
 right?


>> You
 know,
 and
 every
 iteration
 of
 this


argument
 for
 the
 last
 40
 years
 has
 been


wrong.


>> Yeah,
 I
 know.


>> You
 know,
 the
 economy
 continues
 to
 grow.


Uh
 it's
 now
 the
 second
 biggest
 in
 the


world.
 slowed
 down,
 you
 know,
 a
 bit,
 but


it's
 still
 one
 of
 the
 fastest
 growing


economies
 in
 the
 world.
 Um,
 it,
 you


know,
 is
 the
 world's
 biggest


manufacturer,
 biggest
 trading
 nation,


very
 dynamically
 integrated
 with
 the


rest
 of
 the
 world.
 And
 the
 Communist


Party
 is
 still
 very
 much
 in
 control
 and


uh
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 be
 going
 anywhere.


So,
 just
 because
 an
 argument
 has
 been


wrong
 for
 45
 years
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 it


couldn't
 be
 right
 in
 the
 future.
 But
 you


do
 have
 to
 ask
 yourself,
 yeah,


>> okay,
 what
 what's
 going
 on
 here?
 And
 I
 I


think
 what
 this
 ignores
 is
 um
 again
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 structure
 of
 Chinese


institutions
 political
 economic


institutions
 for
 a
 very
 long
 time
 they


have
 been
 very
 very
 different


>> than
 they
 were
 in
 the
 Soviet
 Union


>> even
 going
 back
 to
 the
 plan
 period
 if


you
 compare
 Mauist
 China
 to
 the
 Soviet


Union
 during
 Krushchov
 or
 BRP's
 time


China
 was
 way
 less
 centralized
 the


central
 government
 controlled
 far
 less


prices.
 You
 had
 this
 very
 distributed
 um


idea
 where
 each
 locality
 had
 to
 produce


all
 its
 own
 stuff
 because
 Mao
 was
 was


paranoid
 that
 China
 would
 be
 invaded.
 So


he
 wanted
 there
 to
 be
 duplicate


industrial
 infrastructure
 everywhere.
 Um


uh
 so
 it
 was
 in
 fact
 it
 was
 formally


centralized
 but
 it
 was
 in
 fact
 much
 more


decentralized
 and
 the
 central
 government


had
 le
 much
 less
 uh
 sway
 over
 what
 was


going
 on
 at
 the
 at
 the
 local
 level
 even


during
 ma


>> and
 what
 that
 meant
 was
 that
 when
 you


liberalize
 in
 the
 1980s
 there
 were
 a
 lot


of
 local
 actors
 both
 government
 and


private
 sector
 that
 were
 completely


unconstrained
 in
 what
 they
 could
 do
 and


they
 just
 said
 oh
 it's
 now
 okay
 to
 make


money
 let's
 go
 make
 money
 and
 so
 they


did.
 Um
 so
 that
 was
 a
 very
 different


baseline
 condition
 right
 uh
 and
 then


second
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 way
 that
 China


has
 tried
 to
 develop
 its
 economy
 they've


been
 very
 very
 clear
 that
 they
 wanted
 to


avoid
 the
 pitfalls
 of
 the
 Soviet
 Union


which
 they've
 studied
 carefully
 so
 again


they
 focused
 on
 export
 manufacturing
 so


they
 open
 to
 the
 outside
 world
 they
 did


not
 uh
 pursue
 autarchy
 which
 is
 what
 the


Soviet
 Union
 did
 uh
 and
 they
 focused


very
 very
 um
 diligently
 on
 how
 do
 we


create
 different
 mechanisms
 for


technology
 transfer
 to
 upgrade
 our


abilities
 and
 they've
 uh
 you
 know
 had
 as


I
 said
 a
 a
 much
 more
 competitive
 economy


for
 a
 very
 long
 time.
 So
 it
 is
 the


Chinese
 economy
 bears
 no
 resemblance


whatsoever
 to
 any
 iteration
 of
 the


Soviet
 or
 or
 Russian
 economy
 at
 any


point
 in
 time.
 Now
 I
 think
 I
 think
 what


professor
 Hugh
 is
 is
 pointing
 out
 and
 I


think
 he's
 absolutely
 correct
 in
 this
 is


that
 okay
 maybe
 this
 was
 true
 for
 a


while
 but
 clearly
 under
 Shinjinping


you've
 had
 a
 very
 strong
 move
 to


centralize
 power


>> uh
 to
 increase
 the
 power
 of
 the
 state


reduce
 the
 power
 of
 private


entrepreneurs
 and
 the
 private
 sector
 put


capital
 allocation
 much
 more
 back
 in
 the


hands
 of
 the
 state
 than
 in
 these


non-bank
 financial
 institutions
 and
 so


forth.
 So
 yeah,
 is
 the
 system
 more


centralized,
 more
 authoritarian,
 more


state
 directed
 in
 control
 today
 than
 it


was
 10
 years
 ago?
 Absolutely.


>> And
 does
 that
 increased
 centralization,


state
 control


that
 you
 slowly
 start
 to
 suffocate
 the


the
 engines
 of
 of
 innovation
 in
 China


and
 um
 and
 creativity?
 Absolutely
 those


risks
 are
 there
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 totally


appropriate
 to
 point
 those
 out
 and
 I


think
 if
 you
 just
 look
 at
 China's
 growth


performance
 over
 the
 last
 uh
 decade
 it's


very
 clear
 that
 as
 this
 centralization


you
 know
 grew
 China
 started
 growing


slower
 and
 part
 of
 that
 was
 natural
 but


I
 think
 the
 last
 several
 years
 uh
 it's


very
 clear
 that
 China
 is
 growing
 slower


than
 it
 potentially
 could
 its
 potential


growth
 rate
 is
 a
 point
 or
 two
 higher


what
 we're
 actually
 seeing.
 Um,
 and
 the


government
 and
 Xiinping
 seem
 to
 think


that's
 okay
 because
 we
 the
 technology
 a


bit
 is
 doing
 well.
 Um,
 so
 I
 think
 I


think
 it's
 I
 think
 it's
 right
 to
 point


out
 that
 there's
 increased
 risk
 of
 this


kind
 of
 institutional
 ceiling.
 But
 I


have
 to
 say
 that
 if
 you
 look
 over
 many


decades,
 what
 you
 find
 is
 that
 time
 and


again,
 China
 has
 seemed
 to
 run
 up


against
 institutional
 limits
 of
 one
 kind


or
 another.


>> And
 then
 the
 system
 has
 adjusted
 in


order
 to
 keep
 growth
 and
 and


technological
 progress
 going.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 what
 you
 see
 in
 the
 manufacturing


sector
 in
 China
 today
 is
 is
 basically


that.
 Yeah.
 If
 you're
 an
 internet
 oper


entrepreneur,
 your
 life
 is
 bad
 now


compared
 to
 what
 it
 was
 seven
 or
 eight


years
 ago.
 But
 if
 you're
 in
 technology


oriented
 manufacturing,


>> your
 problem
 is
 not
 that
 the
 government


is
 squeezing
 you
 out.
 Your
 problem
 is


that
 you
 have
 this
 just
 incredible


competitive
 pressure
 from
 everyone
 else.


Yeah.


>> In
 your
 sector.
 So,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


problem
 of
 sort
 of
 uh
 capitalism
 on


steroids,
 if
 you
 will,
 as
 opposed
 to
 uh


an
 an
 overly
 oppressive
 government.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 think
 like
 the
 the
 rhetoric


changed
 a
 lot.
 I
 think
 in
 recent
 years


uh
 I
 believe
 like
 two
 or
 three
 years
 ago


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 um
 you
 know


internet
 koss
 they
 came
 on
 to
 podcast


and
 published
 articles
 saying
 oh
 now


it's
 a
 state
 time
 you
 know
 like
 it's
 a


in
 Chinese
 it
 called
 which
 it
 means
 like


the
 state
 state
 company
 is
 going
 to
 own


everything
 like
 private
 company
 they
 can


just
 like
 exit
 the
 stage
 it's
 now
 it's


our
 show
 now
 but
 I
 think
 like
 the
 right


now
 now
 nowadays
 they
 pull
 back
 that


rhetoric
 a
 lot
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 you


know
 small
 business
 owners
 or
 they're


scared
 and
 they
 just
 like
 flee
 the


countries,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 No,
 and
 it's
 absolutely
 true
 that


if
 you
 talk
 to,
 you
 know,
 people
 in
 the


business
 class
 in
 Shanghai
 or
 or
 Beijing


and
 particularly
 people
 who
 did
 well
 in


the
 2000s
 and
 the
 2010s,


you
 know,
 they
 are
 very
 very
 disgruntled


with
 the
 current
 state
 of
 affairs.


They're
 very
 unhappy
 that
 the
 government


is
 not
 um
 allowing
 more
 freedom
 and
 the


government
 is
 not
 more
 progrowth
 in
 a


general
 sense.
 Uh
 and
 and
 there's


absolutely
 no
 question
 if
 you
 just
 read


the
 economic
 data
 from
 month
 to
 month.


>> China
 has
 a
 very
 significant
 confidence


problem.
 Consumers,
 households,
 they


don't
 want
 to
 buy
 stuff.
 Yeah.


>> They're
 holding
 back
 and
 saving
 all


their
 money,
 not
 spending
 it.


>> And
 private
 companies
 are
 very
 very


reluctant
 to
 invest.
 um
 you
 know


particularly
 if
 what
 they're
 producing


is
 sort
 of
 consumerf
 facing
 products
 and


consumerf
 facing
 services
 because
 they


just
 see
 consumers
 like
 downgrading


their
 conception
 all
 the
 time.
 So


there's
 no
 question
 that
 you've
 got
 a
 a


significant
 lack
 of
 confidence
 relative


to
 what
 you
 had
 um
 several
 years
 ago.


I
 just
 think
 that
 as
 as
 bad
 a
 problem
 as


that
 is,
 China
 is
 a
 big
 country
 and


there
 are,
 you
 know,
 big
 chunks
 of
 the


economy
 that
 are
 globally
 significant,


you
 know,
 essentially
 in
 the
 tech


industrial
 sector
 which
 are
 doing


extremely
 well
 and
 where
 the
 the
 problem


for
 entrepreneurs
 is
 not
 a
 lack
 of


confidence,
 right?


uh
 the
 the
 problem
 is
 just
 an


extraordinary
 amount
 of
 of
 competition


>> competition.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 they
 have
 to
 work
 very
 hard
 but


it's
 that
 you
 know
 you
 look
 at
 the


people
 who
 are
 leading
 companies
 like


BYD
 or
 Xiaomi
 or
 CL
 or
 any
 of
 these


companies


>> uh
 they
 exude
 comp
 confidence
 that
 they


have
 literally
 worldconquering
 products


and
 they're
 probably
 right


>> but
 their
 life
 dayto-day
 is
 kind
 of
 not


so
 great
 because
 all
 their
 competitors


are
 making
 it
 very
 very
 hard
 for
 them
 to


you
 know
 keep
 the
 level
 of
 profitability


they
 buy
 Yeah,


>> I
 agree.


Yeah.
 Now,
 uh
 let's
 move
 on
 to
 the
 next


question.
 I
 think
 that
 this
 question
 is


going
 to
 be
 interesting
 because
 I
 think


everybody
 like
 all
 the
 economists
 was


like
 kind
 of
 recommending
 China
 is
 like


increase
 your
 consumption.
 Even
 the
 US


government
 I
 think
 kind
 of
 pressure


China
 to
 kind
 of
 transform
 the
 economy


from
 export
 oriented
 towards
 consumption


oriented.
 I
 think
 professor
 Shu
 argued


that
 um
 you
 know
 because
 of
 the
 current


uh
 Chinese
 um
 distribution
 policy
 like


how
 you
 kind
 of
 distribute
 the
 wealths


among
 all
 the
 uh
 citizens
 in
 the


country.
 It's
 very
 difficult
 to
 actually


convince
 all
 the
 Chinese
 that
 yeah,


we're
 going
 to
 encourage
 a
 consumption


lab
 model
 because
 of
 that.
 Like
 they


just
 don't
 have
 the
 money
 or
 they
 don't


have
 the
 confidence
 in
 the
 economy
 that


when
 they
 spend
 that
 money,
 the
 state
 is


going
 to
 hold
 them
 back
 if
 like
 the


bottoms
 falls
 out,
 right?
 Like
 if
 you


have
 another
 co
 hit
 or
 like
 there's
 a


bubble
 burst
 and
 you
 lost
 your
 house,


you
 lost
 your
 job,
 like
 what
 you
 do,


right?


>> There's
 not
 much
 welfare
 to
 kind
 of
 hold


them
 up.
 That's
 a
 reason
 like
 a
 lot
 of


consumer
 in
 China
 are
 very
 reluctant
 to


spend
 and
 they
 actually
 pivot
 towards


like
 you
 know
 they
 called
 call
 it
 uh


transition
 to
 a
 lower
 priced
 goods
 like


right
 yes
 downgrade
 downgrade
 of
 the


consumption


>> consumer
 downgrade
 that's
 right


>> yeah
 consump
 downgrade
 so
 what
 do
 you


think
 about
 the
 current
 situation
 and


also
 all
 the
 you
 know
 conflict
 among


that
 distribution
 system
 like
 if
 the


state
 or
 the
 Beijing
 does
 refuse
 to


empower
 all
 the
 worker
 like
 politically


like
 give
 them
 the
 union
 rights
 increase


their
 earnings
 or
 like
 boost
 their


property
 rights
 like
 give
 them
 like
 a


permanent
 property
 uh
 ownership.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 calling
 for
 this
 boosting
 domestic


consumption
 is
 simply
 rhetoric
 instead


of
 really
 anything
 that
 holds
 water.


What
 do
 you
 think?


>> Yeah,
 this
 is
 a
 very
 messy
 discussion
 I


have
 to
 say.
 Um
 so
 the
 first
 observation


is
 okay
 so
 people
 have
 been
 commenting


on


the
 so-called
 lack
 of
 consumption
 in
 the


Chinese
 economy
 you
 know
 for
 decades


>> for
 decades.


Right.
 Um
 you
 know
 and
 what
 they
 point


to
 is
 if
 you
 look
 if
 you
 divide
 the


economy
 into
 you
 know
 investment
 and


consumption
 those
 are
 the
 two
 main


components
 of
 it.
 We'll
 see
 the
 Chinese


investment
 the
 share
 of
 Chinese
 economy


that's
 investment
 is
 very
 high
 the
 share


of
 Chinese
 economy
 that
 is
 that
 is


consumption
 is
 very
 low
 by
 international


standards.
 So


>> there's
 some
 technical
 problems
 the
 way


the
 Chinese
 statistics
 are
 cons


constructed.
 I
 think
 they
 underestimate


the
 true
 consumption
 rate.
 It's
 it's


probably
 five
 or
 six
 points
 higher


>> um
 than
 than
 is
 reported
 in
 the
 in
 the


in
 the
 data.
 Even
 if
 you
 make
 that


adjustment,
 it's
 still
 on
 the
 low
 side.


Um


but
 it's
 also
 the
 case
 is
 what
 what


economy
 had
 by
 far
 by
 far
 the
 fastest


rate
 of
 household
 consumption
 growth


from
 2000
 to
 2020.
 It
 was
 China.
 And
 it


was
 not
 even
 close.
 Right?
 So
 the
 um
 uh


I
 think
 Chinese
 household
 consumption


grew
 sixfold
 during
 that
 those
 two


decades
 from
 2000
 to
 2020.
 You
 look
 at


another
 high
 growth
 you
 know
 emerging


economy
 India
 it
 was
 I
 think
 the
 growth


was
 you
 know
 a
 quarter
 of
 that.


>> You
 look
 at
 any
 you
 know
 advanced


economy
 is
 way
 lower.
 So
 it
 is
 it
 is


false
 to
 say
 that
 China
 has
 had
 weak


consumption
 growth.
 They've
 had
 actually


extremely
 strong
 consumption
 growth
 and


you
 know
 anyone
 who
 is
 aware
 of
 what
 the


standard
 of
 living
 was
 in
 China
 urban


China
 20
 years
 ago
 and
 what
 it
 is
 today


there's
 just
 no
 comparison.


>> Yeah.
 Um,
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 first


thing
 that
 we
 need
 to
 to
 stipulate
 is


that
 when
 people
 say
 China's
 consumption


is
 weak,
 that
 isn't
 actually
 true
 in


absolute
 terms,
 right?


>> It's
 true
 in
 terms
 of
 some
 uh
 uh
 picture


that
 you
 draw
 of
 the
 structure
 of
 the


whole
 economy
 and
 and
 the
 share
 of


consumption.
 Mhm.


>> And
 um
 you
 know
 I
 think
 what's
 more


accurate
 to
 say
 is
 that
 it's
 not
 that


China
 consumes
 too
 little
 that
 it


invests
 too
 much.
 Right.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 um
 this
 is
 the
 fundamental
 issue
 that


the
 way
 the
 state
 is
 constructed
 you


know
 the
 state
 essentially
 controls
 the


financial
 system.
 All
 the
 excess
 money


in
 the
 economy


essentially
 flows
 into
 state
 controlled


institutions
 and
 it
 is
 allocated
 to


investment
 needs
 first


and
 the
 investments
 are
 strategic.
 So
 in


other
 words,
 they're
 not
 saying
 what
 is


what
 is
 the
 investment
 that's
 going
 to


get
 us
 the
 highest
 financial
 return
 in


the
 next
 two
 years,
 which
 is
 basically


how
 it
 works
 in
 a
 country
 like
 the


United
 States.
 They
 say
 what
 are
 the


strategic
 industries
 that
 the
 state


wants
 to
 support
 over
 the
 next
 20
 years?


let's
 put
 a
 bunch
 of
 capital
 into
 them


and,
 you
 know,
 hope
 it
 eventually
 works,


right?


>> So,
 what
 you
 wind
 up
 doing
 there
 is
 um


uh
 taking
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 out
 of
 the


households
 and
 using
 it
 to
 finance
 very


long-term
 investments
 in
 infrastructure,


industry,
 and
 so
 forth.
 that
 may
 in
 fact


produce
 a
 good
 economic
 return
 over
 a


long
 period
 of
 time
 but
 actually
 don't


um
 provide
 a
 very
 good
 financial
 return


in
 the
 short
 short
 run
 and
 what
 that


does
 is
 you
 know
 if
 you
 think
 about
 a
 US


household
 American
 household
 or
 a


European
 household
 they
 have
 some
 extra


money
 what
 do
 they
 do
 you
 know
 they


might
 invest
 it
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 um


they
 might
 invest
 it
 in
 you
 know
 bonds


that
 generate
 certain
 kind
 of
 return
 and


so
 they
 wind
 up
 in
 aggregate
 having


quite
 a
 bit
 of
 financial
 income
 in


addition
 to
 their
 um
 uh
 their
 wage


income.


>> In
 China,
 basically
 households
 are
 not


allowed
 to
 have
 any
 financial
 income


because
 all
 financial
 income
 is


essentially
 seized
 by
 the
 state
 and
 put


into
 these
 long-term
 investments.


>> Um
 and
 I
 think
 that
 is
 actually
 a
 bigger


cause
 of
 this
 low
 consumption
 rate.
 Mhm.


>> It's
 that
 basically
 people
 don't
 have
 as


much
 income
 in
 China
 as
 you
 would
 expect


given
 the
 uh
 rate
 of
 development
 and
 and


part
 of
 that
 has
 to
 do
 with
 wage


suppression
 but
 part
 of
 it
 also
 has
 to


do
 with
 the
 sort
 of
 commonandeering


financial
 income
 by
 the
 state
 rather


than
 the
 private
 sector.
 Um
 and
 I
 think


that's
 more
 important
 than
 often
 what


people
 talk
 about
 the
 social
 safety
 net


etc.


>> Um
 now
 is
 that
 ever
 going
 to
 change?
 I


would
 say
 no.
 this
 is
 not
 going
 to


change.
 So
 where
 where
 I
 would
 agree


with
 this
 critique
 is
 while
 I
 think
 that


the
 underconumption
 problem
 is
 in
 a


sense
 overstated,


I
 think
 the
 balance
 between
 investment


and
 consumption
 in
 in
 China
 is
 basically


fixed
 in
 stone


>> because
 that's
 what
 the
 government
 wants


it
 to
 be.
 And
 because
 they
 control
 the


entire
 financial
 system,
 they
 can
 make


it
 to
 be
 that
 way.
 And
 as
 long
 as
 enough


of
 these
 investments


produce
 some
 kind
 of
 an
 economic
 return


over
 the
 long
 run,
 you
 know,
 the
 system


can
 continue.
 So
 yeah,
 I
 I
 make
 I'm


making
 a
 lot
 of
 sort
 of
 technical


disagreements
 with
 the
 argument,
 but
 the


conclusion
 I
 actually
 agree
 with,


>> which
 is
 that
 there
 is
 almost
 no


>> possibility
 that
 within
 the
 next
 few


years,


>> we
 will
 see
 a
 significant
 shift
 in


China's
 economic
 model
 away
 from
 this


sort
 of
 investment
 and
 export-led
 growth


to
 more
 consumption-driven
 model.
 I
 just


don't
 see
 that
 happening
 because
 you


know
 basically
 the
 communist
 party
 has


decided
 how
 things
 should
 run
 and
 from


their
 point
 of
 view
 um
 you
 know
 it's


been
 very
 successful
 they've
 they've


>> created
 gigantic
 economy
 where
 everyone


you
 know
 has
 a
 much
 better
 life
 than


they
 used
 to
 and
 Chinese
 companies
 are


now
 increasingly
 you
 know
 globally


competitive


>> um
 across
 a
 wide
 range
 of
 technologies.


So
 they
 say
 what
 is
 the
 problem
 here?


people
 have
 a
 good
 life,
 we
 have


addressed
 our
 needs
 for
 global


competitiveness,
 for
 national
 security,


etc.
 Um,
 it's
 fine,
 right?
 Uh,
 you
 know,


and
 so
 an
 economist
 will
 say,
 well,
 but


you've
 left
 a
 lot
 of
 consumer
 welfare
 on


the
 table.


>> Um,
 but
 the
 party
 will
 just
 say,
 well,


we
 we
 beg
 to
 differ.
 No,
 we
 have
 a


different
 concept
 of
 how
 things
 should


work.
 And
 until
 that
 concept
 is
 proven


not
 to
 function,
 they're
 going
 to
 keep


doing
 it.


>> Yeah.
 Also,
 the
 other
 thing
 kind
 of


noticed
 is
 uh
 I
 remember
 watching
 a


lecture
 you
 were
 giving
 like
 um
 two


years
 ago,
 you
 basically
 said
 that
 the


the
 Chinese
 government
 realized
 like


after
 2008
 the
 US
 model
 is
 not
 something


they
 want
 to
 inherit.
 They
 want
 to


follow
 that
 like
 they
 do
 not
 want
 China


to
 become
 a
 over
 consumption
 driven
 and


then
 you
 have
 all
 this
 uh
 debt
 problems


like
 happened
 in
 2008
 and
 they
 want
 to


be
 like
 Germany
 right
 like
 uh
 like


export
 oriented.
 Yeah.


>> Right.
 Yeah.
 Now
 there's
 some
 you
 know


there
 there's
 some
 nuances
 on
 that


because
 they
 have
 their
 own
 huge
 debt


problems.
 They're
 just
 in
 the
 you
 know


the
 local
 government
 sector
 etc.
 But
 uh


but
 yeah
 that's
 that's
 basically
 that's


basically
 right.
 They've
 decided
 that


they
 want
 to
 be
 more
 of
 what
 I
 call
 a


Leninist
 Germany
 that
 is
 to
 say
 a


technology
 export
 oriented
 economy
 with


a
 huge
 manufacturing
 sector
 but
 you
 know


not
 social
 democratic
 but
 lex
 that's


their
 that's
 their
 model.
 It's
 actually


a
 interesting
 point
 to
 pivot
 to
 the
 next


question
 because
 you
 mentioned
 about


like
 the
 Chinese
 government
 had
 this


industrial
 policy
 want
 to
 invest
 in


manufacturing
 sector
 high-tech
 sector
 to


drive
 you
 know
 global
 competitive


competitive
 companies.
 However,
 you
 see


like
 uh
 US
 and
 China
 has
 a
 trade
 war
 2.0


you
 know
 like
 happened
 last
 year
 right


like
 when
 Trump
 uh
 returned
 to
 the


office
 and
 now
 it
 seems
 like
 China's


trade
 war
 like
 all
 like
 I
 would
 say
 like


trade
 conflict
 with
 European
 Union
 and


other
 countries
 are
 just
 getting
 more


and
 more
 like
 uh
 headlines
 you
 see
 the


news
 right
 and
 the
 Chinese
 overcapacity


is
 definitely
 a
 problem
 you
 know
 like


the
 some
 of
 the
 company
 like
 Xiaomi
 you


said
 like
 super
 competitive
 it's
 like
 if


you
 put
 it
 in
 North
 America
 probably
 all


the
 other
 electric
 vehicle
 company
 will


be
 killed
 but
 again
 it's
 in
 China
 and


there's
 not
 only
 one
 Xiaomi,
 there's


also
 BYD
 and
 other
 car
 EV
 manufacturers,


right?


>> So
 there
 definitely
 seem
 to
 be
 an


overcapacity
 problem
 in
 China
 and


professor
 Chinuay
 use
 a
 concept,
 they


call
 it
 uh
 horncker's
 fable.
 So


basically
 said
 like
 if
 a
 totalitarian


regime
 like
 East
 Germany
 treat
 freely


with
 all
 the
 western
 civilized
 companies


uh
 countries
 and
 while
 suppressing
 its


workers
 condition
 you're
 going
 to
 have


like
 uh
 unc
 to
 say
 unfair
 advantage
 over


like
 a
 democratic
 countries
 and
 then


eventually
 those
 countries
 will
 start
 to


decoupling
 with
 you
 because
 they
 think


they
 cannot
 out
 compete
 you
 in
 a
 in
 a


fair
 um
 arena.
 So
 how
 do
 you
 kind
 of
 see


that
 like
 would
 that
 the
 trade
 war
 and


all
 the
 other
 like
 you
 know
 tax
 policies


kind
 of
 protectionism
 in
 different


countries
 starting
 to
 hurt
 the
 Chinese


model.
 Yeah,
 I'm


I'm
 a
 little
 skeptical
 of
 this
 story.
 Um


because,
 you
 know,
 you've
 had


protectionist
 pressure
 building
 for
 the


last,
 you
 know,
 seven
 or
 eight
 years,


starting
 with
 the
 the
 trade
 war
 uh
 that


Trump
 launched
 in
 2018.
 Now,
 in


fairness,
 you
 know,
 for
 the
 first
 few


years
 really
 didn't
 add
 up
 to
 much.
 It's


no
 more,
 you
 know,
 significant.


Nonetheless,
 you
 know,
 all
 of
 this


protectionist
 pressure,
 what
 has
 it
 done


to
 China's
 exports?
 Nothing.
 Basically,


they
 continue
 to
 grow.
 What
 has
 it
 done


to
 China's
 share
 of
 global
 manufactured


goods
 exports?
 Nothing.
 They
 still


account
 for,
 you
 know,
 over
 20%
 of


global
 manufacturers.
 They
 run
 the
 the


overall
 trade
 surplus,
 you
 know,
 has


grown
 to
 over
 a
 trillion
 dollars.
 If
 you


just
 look
 at
 the
 manufactured
 component


of
 that,
 it's
 even
 larger.
 Um


so
 um
 you
 know
 if
 the
 rest
 of the
 world


is
 is
 thinking
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 you


know
 solve
 their
 problem
 with
 China
 by


being
 protectionist
 they're
 doing
 a


really
 bad
 job
 of
 it.


>> Um
 so
 that's
 I
 think
 the
 first


observation
 is
 that
 that
 protectionist


rhetoric
 and
 protectionist
 action
 has


actually
 not
 had
 that
 much
 of
 an
 impact.


Mhm.


>> Um


and
 I
 think
 the
 the
 other
 thing
 that
 you


see
 is
 that
 um


um
 these
 technological
 supply
 chains
 are


very
 complicated,


>> right?


>> And
 what
 you
 continue
 to
 see
 despite
 all


the
 protectionism
 is
 uh
 companies


throughout
 the
 world
 realizing
 that
 they


need
 to
 do
 things
 in
 China
 to
 be
 more


competitive
 or
 have
 Chinese
 suppliers.


Um
 so
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 among
 all
 of
 this


sort
 of
 rhetorical
 decoupling
 pressure


what
 you
 see
 at
 the
 ground
 level
 is


very
 very
 limited
 decoupling
 in
 a
 few


sectors.
 Mhm.


>> Um,
 you
 know,
 a
 a
 great
 example
 of
 this


is


auto
 autonomous
 driving
 in
 the
 United


States,
 right?
 So,
 the
 leader
 industry


leader
 there
 is
 Whimo.


Um,
 they
 have,
 you
 know,
 a
 number
 of


places
 that
 they
 source
 their
 vehicles


from,
 but
 a
 big
 one
 is
 the
 Chinese


company
 Gile
 Ziko
 brand.
 Mhm.


>> Um
 and
 you
 know
 they
 haven't
 really


advertised
 this
 and
 kind
 of
 the
 way
 that


they
 get
 around
 um
 the
 tariffs
 I
 believe


is
 that
 they
 essentially
 that
 the
 car
 is


not
 a
 fully
 uh
 functioning
 unit
 until
 it


is
 equipped
 with
 all
 of
 Whimo's


um
 u
 self-driving
 equipment.
 So
 they


they
 basically
 take


>> the
 guts
 of
 the
 car
 from
 J
 and
 then
 they


uh
 and
 then
 they
 put
 all
 of
 the


equipment
 on
 top
 of
 it.
 Still
 kind
 of


expensive.
 Uh
 and
 they're
 looking
 at


other
 options,
 but
 um


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 of


continued
 uh
 you
 know
 back
 and
 forth


between
 the
 US
 and
 the
 Chinese
 tech


ecosystems
 because
 they
 they
 still
 kind


of
 need
 each
 other.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 so
 I
 I
 basically
 think
 that
 um


first
 of
 all
 that
 China's
 competitive


advantages
 are
 not
 just
 low
 labor
 cost


right
 they
 now
 have
 the
 top
 companies


there
 now
 legitimately
 have


uh
 globally
 competitive
 or
 sometimes


globally
 leading
 technology


um
 this
 is
 clearly
 true
 in
 electricals


and
 batteries
 I
 think
 it
 is
 increasingly


true
 in
 things
 like
 industrial


automation
 robots
 etc.


Um
 it's
 clearly
 true
 in
 green
 energy


equipment.
 Uh
 and
 you
 can
 go
 on
 and
 on.


Um
 and
 so
 China
 is
 has
 very
 strong


technology.
 They
 have
 an
 ecosystem


that
 enables
 the
 technology
 to
 be
 scaled


up
 very
 quickly.
 So
 the
 unit
 costs
 come


down
 essentially
 through
 economies
 of


scale
 where
 they
 can
 iterate
 much
 more


quickly.
 So
 the,
 you
 know,
 the
 product


cycle
 for
 a
 Chinese
 vehicle,
 electric


vehicle
 typically
 is
 12
 to
 18
 months


compared
 to
 three
 to
 five
 years
 for
 a


western
 vehicle
 maker.
 And
 so
 if
 you
 can


bring
 products
 to
 market
 much
 more


quickly,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 keep


up
 with
 or
 anticipate
 consumer
 demand


much
 better
 than
 your
 competitor.
 So


this
 isn't
 true
 in
 every
 single
 Chinese


sector.
 And
 I
 think
 we
 need
 to
 be


careful
 about
 assuming
 that
 everything


in
 China
 is
 like
 the
 EV
 industry
 because


it's
 not.


>> Yeah.
 But
 in
 in
 those
 leading


industries,
 Chinese
 companies
 are
 just


really
 really
 good
 at
 what
 they
 do
 and


they
 have
 advantages
 uh
 which
 are
 very


very
 large
 and
 multifaceted
 and
 and


really
 cannot
 be
 offset
 by
 a
 you
 know
 a


a
 tariff
 unless
 they
 could
 be
 offset
 by


an
 export
 exclusion
 and
 just
 say
 we
 are


going
 to
 ban
 the
 imports
 of
 your


products
 period
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 what


the
 US
 has
 done.
 Mhm.


>> Uh
 most
 countries
 aren't
 interested
 in


doing
 that
 because
 they
 want
 the
 stuff.


Um
 you
 know,
 most
 countries
 do
 not
 have


competitive
 industries
 that
 they
 need
 to


protect.
 So
 if
 China
 has
 the
 best


product
 at
 the
 lowest
 price,
 they're


going
 to
 buy
 that.


>> And
 what
 you've
 seen
 is
 that
 China
 has


been
 very
 successful
 at
 shifting
 away


from
 the
 US
 market
 to
 other
 markets,


particularly
 in
 the
 emerging
 world.


>> Um
 they
 get
 lower
 prices,
 so
 it
 hurts


them.
 Um
 but
 they
 get
 the
 volume
 and


they
 get
 the
 market
 exposure.
 So
 um
 I


think
 that
 China
 is
 now
 so
 integrated
 in


the
 global
 economy
 and
 the
 sources
 of


its
 competitiveness
 are
 so
 diverse
 and


so
 many
 of
 them
 are
 technologically


determined.
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 that


decoupling
 works.
 It
 it
 only
 works
 if


you
 have
 basically
 a
 world
 war
 which


forces
 everyone
 to
 decouple
 you
 know


which
 has
 happened
 a
 couple
 of
 times


before.


>> Uh
 that
 would
 be
 very
 bad
 on
 many
 on


many
 levels.
 But
 short
 of
 that
 it
 is


very
 hard
 to
 see


uh
 effective
 fully
 effective
 decoupling


other
 than
 you
 know
 here
 and
 there
 you


know
 individual


>> specific
 supply
 chains
 that
 are
 really


really
 important.


>> Yeah
 maybe
 but
 on
 a
 macro
 scale
 um
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 really
 see
 China
 being


derailed
 by
 that.


>> Got
 it.
 And
 also
 like
 I
 think
 um
 it
 also


depends
 on
 like
 uh
 the
 other
 democratic


countries
 um
 president
 and
 their
 policy


you
 know
 like
 during
 better
 era
 he's


like
 promoting
 a
 French
 shoring


technology
 like
 fresh
 shoring
 uh


strategy
 basically
 working
 with
 all
 the


other
 kind
 of
 you
 know
 countries
 that


have
 the
 similar


>> government
 or
 democratic
 values
 compared


to
 America
 and
 then
 kind
 of
 allocate


those
 supply
 chain
 there.
 Uh
 I
 think
 uh


when
 President
 Trump
 come
 into
 office,


he
 immediately
 abandoned
 Biden's


strategy
 and
 just
 I
 think
 that


>> to
 certain
 extent
 actually
 helps
 China
 a


little
 bit
 on
 that
 side
 because
 he


started
 a
 trade
 war
 with
 everybody.
 So


the
 competitive
 advantage
 of
 like
 doing


the
 French
 roing
 is
 much
 less
 compared


to
 the
 Biden
 era
 because
 you
 have
 less


tariff
 like
 from
 other
 countries.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 even
 that,
 you
 know,
 I


was
 much
 more
 sympathetic
 to
 the
 the


French
 stoing
 strategy


>> um
 than
 to
 what
 Trump
 is
 doing
 for
 sure,


but
 it
 it's
 pretty
 severely
 limited,


right?
 And
 a
 point
 that
 I've
 made
 in


some
 of
 my
 publications
 is
 that
 China


just
 has
 a
 very
 special
 ecosystem


>> which
 is
 extremely
 powerful.


>> Um,
 and
 if
 you
 want
 to
 compete
 with
 them


across
 the
 board,
 you
 would
 have
 to


recreate
 that
 ecosystem
 across
 the


board.
 Mhm.


>> It's
 basically
 impossible
 to
 do
 that


under
 a
 French
 roing
 model
 because
 every


country
 has
 its
 own
 interests.
 You
 can't


coordinate.
 It's
 way
 more
 complicated.


>> So
 the
 only
 way
 that
 French
 works
 is


that
 you
 pick
 a
 few
 sectors
 where
 you


think
 it's
 really
 really
 important
 not


to
 rely
 on
 Chinese
 um
 inputs
 or
 not
 to


rely
 on
 totally.
 And
 in
 these
 individual


sectors,
 you
 say,
 "Okay,
 we're
 going
 to


pick
 not
 everything
 but
 like
 three
 or


four
 or
 five
 and
 and
 do
 that
 really


robustly."
 and
 that
 and
 that
 could
 work


if
 you
 give
 it
 enough
 time.
 Um
 but
 I


think
 the
 problem
 now
 is
 that
 as
 you
 say


that
 Trump
 has
 basically
 abandoned
 that


strategy
 and
 if
 you
 look
 for
 example


what
 are
 the
 incentives
 in
 Europe


they're
 very
 mixed
 right
 now
 because
 on


the
 one
 hand
 a
 lot
 of
 their
 industrial


base
 is
 getting
 hollowed
 out
 by
 Chinese


competition
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 the
 US
 is


shutting
 off
 its
 markets.


So
 what
 do
 you
 do
 if
 you're
 European


industry?
 A
 lot
 of
 European
 industries


say
 particularly
 the
 car
 makers
 would


say
 well
 look
 we
 can't
 really
 rely
 on


the
 US
 anymore.
 So
 we
 need
 to
 double


down
 on
 our
 investments
 in
 China


>> so
 that
 we
 can


uh
 stay
 close
 to
 the
 leading
 edge.
 We


can
 take
 advantage
 of
 all
 of
 the


ecosystem
 benefits
 there.
 And
 that's
 how


we
 how
 we
 keep
 ahead
 uh
 you
 know
 um
 on


innovation
 you
 know
 and
 that
 may
 or
 may


not
 work
 but
 it's
 pretty
 understandable


why
 they're
 thinking
 that
 way.


>> Yeah
 definitely
 agree.
 Um


now
 let's
 move
 on
 to
 the
 next
 question.


I
 think
 uh
 this
 is
 very
 interesting


because
 uh
 recently
 Beijing
 is
 like


finally
 doing
 some
 kind
 of
 fiscal


packages
 to
 help
 the
 market.
 I
 would
 say


like
 in
 in
 the
 Chinese
 term
 they
 call
 it


is
 basically
 saving
 the
 market.
 And
 uh


professor
 Shu
 is
 very
 skeptical.
 He


viewed
 those
 measures
 strictly
 through


the
 lens
 of
 a
 soft
 budget
 um
 constraint.


He
 argued
 that
 this
 money
 is
 not
 a
 real


stimulus
 for
 the
 girls
 or
 uh
 it's


actually
 just
 a
 essential
 life
 support


for
 uh
 all
 those
 uh
 local
 government


debt
 as
 you
 mentioned
 before
 like


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 local
 government
 uh


shadow
 shadow
 banking
 kind
 of
 going
 on


and
 they
 have
 those
 investment
 platform


which
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 lowquality


investment
 and
 huge
 debt
 problem.
 Do
 you


agree
 with
 that
 um
 observation
 like
 the


all
 the
 stimulus
 is
 basically
 try
 to


life
 support
 the
 system
 instead
 of


really
 try
 to
 encourage
 more


consumptions
 or
 help
 the
 every
 every


like
 you
 know
 citizens
 in
 China.


>> Yeah,
 I
 basically
 agree
 with
 that.
 Uh


you
 know
 I
 think
 that
 the
 soft
 budget


constraint
 idea
 this
 is
 an
 idea
 that


goes
 back
 to
 a
 Hungarian


uh
 scholar
 Janos
 Cornai
 um
 who
 back
 in


the
 I
 think
 80s
 or
 90s
 wrote
 a
 very
 good


um
 explanation
 of
 how
 he
 was
 talking


about
 eastern
 block
 countries
 and
 how


they
 worked
 under
 the
 sort
 of
 socialist


model.


>> Uh
 it's
 a
 very
 powerful
 concept
 and
 I


think
 it
 explains
 a
 a
 ton
 of
 what's


going
 on
 in
 China.
 It's
 basically
 the


idea
 is
 these
 local
 governments
 um
 or


state
 actors
 can
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 uh


and
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 if
 they
 make


bad
 decisions
 they
 don't
 have
 to
 bear


the
 cost
 of


>> those
 decisions
 they
 don't
 go
 bankrupt


or
 or
 whatever.
 Um
 and
 I
 think
 that
 is
 a


very
 very
 continues
 to
 be
 a
 very


powerful
 concept
 um
 as
 relates
 to
 China


and
 I
 think
 it
 accurately
 describes
 the


so-called
 stimulus
 program.
 Um,
 so
 you


can
 talk
 about
 either
 of
 these
 debt


swaps
 narrowly
 or
 you
 can
 talk
 about
 the


broader
 so-called
 stimulus
 measures
 that


the
 government
 started
 putting
 in
 place


about
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 ago.


>> And
 I
 never
 called
 them
 stimulus


measures.
 I
 said
 these
 are
 support


measures.


>> Yeah.


>> They're
 there
 to,
 you
 know,
 make
 sure


that
 economic
 activity
 doesn't
 fall


below
 a
 certain
 level,
 but
 they're
 not


aiming
 to
 um
 accelerate
 things.
 But
 I
 I


think
 Professor
 Chu,
 you
 know,
 puts
 his


finger
 on
 a
 very
 important
 point
 here,


which
 is
 that
 not
 only
 are
 they
 not


stimulative,


they
 they
 kind
 of
 embed


a
 big
 reason
 for
 why
 you
 have
 this


problem
 of
 excess
 capacity
 in
 China,


right?
 So
 why
 do
 you
 have,


>> you
 know,


>> 20
 or
 30


>> electric
 vehicle
 companies
 Yeah.


producing
 at
 scale?
 I
 mean,
 they're
 more


>> used
 to
 be
 a
 hundred.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I'm
 I'm
 discounting
 the
 ones


that
 that
 really,
 you
 know,
 exist
 more


on
 paper,
 but
 you
 know,
 ones
 that
 really


produce
 significant
 numbers
 of
 EVs.


There's
 20
 or
 30
 of
 them,
 right?
 There


probably
 should
 be
 four
 or
 five.
 Yeah.


Right.


>> Uh
 how
 come
 you
 and
 in
 industry
 after


industry,
 you
 have
 this
 situation
 where


there
 are
 many
 many
 more
 competitors.


>> Yeah.


>> Than
 it
 seems
 like
 the
 market
 should
 be


able
 to
 bear.
 And
 this
 lasts
 for
 a


really
 long
 time.


>> And
 the
 basic
 reason
 for
 this
 is
 local


government
 support.
 So
 if
 you
 are
 a


local
 government,
 you
 need
 to
 have
 local


sources
 of
 tax
 revenue
 and
 employment


and
 so
 you
 will
 find
 everything
 in
 your


power
 to
 keep
 your
 local
 EV
 maker
 or


steel
 mail
 or
 whatever
 it
 is
 in
 business


>> so
 that
 you
 can
 collect
 the
 tax
 revenue


and
 and
 the
 people
 will
 be
 employed,


right?
 And
 um
 and
 because
 local


governments
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 tools
 at
 their


disposal,
 not
 just
 cash,


>> but
 they
 can
 you
 they
 can
 hand
 out
 free


land,
 they
 can
 lean
 on
 the
 local
 power


plant
 to
 say,
 "Okay,
 cut
 this
 guy's,
 you


know,
 electricity
 bill
 by
 50%."


>> Or
 whatever.
 they
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 um


non-budgetary
 mechanisms
 by
 which
 they


can
 support
 industries
 and
 keep
 them
 in


business
 even
 if
 the
 company
 is
 is


intrinsically
 not
 very
 profitable.
 Mhm.


>> So
 instead
 of
 a
 normal
 process
 where
 you


have
 a
 flood
 of
 new
 entrance
 into
 a
 hot


sector
 and
 then
 you
 know
 within
 a
 couple


of
 years
 most
 of
 them
 go
 bankrupt
 and
 a


few
 survive


>> the
 people
 who
 should
 have
 gone
 bankrupt


stay
 in
 business
 for
 an
 incredibly
 long


period
 of
 time
 right


>> and
 uh
 and
 so
 that's
 kind
 of
 the


ultimate
 you
 know
 soft
 budget
 constraint


if
 you
 will.
 What's
 interesting
 now
 is


that
 the
 central
 government
 has
 said,


"Oh,
 well,
 this
 is
 terrible.
 We
 don't


like
 all
 this
 excess
 competition.
 It


must
 not
 exist.
 We
 must
 have
 fewer


companies.
 Local
 governments,
 you
 must


stop
 sub
 subsidizing
 these
 companies."


>> Yeah.


>> But
 does
 the
 central
 government
 ever


attack


>> the
 central
 issue
 here,


>> which
 is
 the
 way
 that
 the
 fiscal
 system


has
 set
 up.


>> Yeah.
 which
 number
 one
 gives
 local


governments
 immense
 authority


to
 channel
 resources
 to
 these
 companies


and
 then
 number
 two
 gives
 them
 immense


incentives
 to
 do
 that
 because
 if
 they


don't
 do
 that
 then
 they
 literally
 will


have
 no
 budget
 revenues
 right.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 the
 central
 government
 is


responsible
 for
 that
 because
 they've
 set


up
 a
 fiscal
 system
 which
 makes
 it
 very


very
 hard
 for
 local
 governments
 to


generate
 any
 revenue
 except
 by


essentially
 taxes
 on
 production.


>> Yeah.
 uh
 but
 the
 central
 government
 is


not
 going
 to
 tamper
 with
 that.
 Um
 so


yeah
 this
 whole
 soft
 budget
 constraint


is
 is
 a
 problem
 for
 economic
 growth.
 It


is
 a
 it
 is
 essentially
 what
 creates
 the


excess
 capacity
 problem.


>> And
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 I
 think
 the


central
 government's
 view
 on
 this
 is


well
 this
 is
 not
 ideal.
 We
 would
 love
 it


if
 you
 know
 if
 there
 were
 only
 BYD
 and


Xiaomi
 and
 two
 other
 companies
 making


EVs
 and
 being
 very
 profitable.


On
 the
 other
 hand,
 how
 much
 effort
 are


we
 going
 to
 put
 into
 re
 remaking
 the


system
 so
 that
 happens?
 Not
 that
 much


because


>> okay,
 these
 guys
 have
 to
 cut
 their


prices
 to
 the
 bone.
 That's
 great
 because


then
 they
 are,
 you
 know,
 more


competitive
 on
 global
 export
 markets.


Yeah.
 And
 prices
 fall
 for
 for
 domestic


consumers.


>> So
 the
 central
 government,
 I
 think,
 is


very
 much
 complicit
 in
 this
 in
 this


setup.
 Um,
 and
 so
 far
 they
 do
 not
 have
 a


they
 they
 appear
 not
 to
 have
 a
 strong


interest
 in
 changing
 the
 system.


>> What
 they
 can
 do
 is
 like
 shuffle
 more


money
 into
 the
 system
 through
 things


like
 these
 debt
 swaps
 in
 order
 to
 make


make
 sure
 that
 the
 the
 local
 government


stays
 solvent.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 like
 the
 you
 know
 because


of
 lo
 those
 local
 government
 policy
 you


have
 so
 many
 competitor
 you
 have
 this


like
 fierce
 competition
 kind
 of


everybody
 has
 to
 lower
 their
 price
 if


there's
 a
 new
 market
 kind
 of
 come
 out


like
 the
 EV
 market
 10
 years
 ago


everybody
 is
 jumping
 in
 like
 every
 city


have
 their
 own
 EV
 manufacturer


>> that
 definitely
 create
 a
 lot
 of


competition
 for
 uh
 developing
 the


advanced
 technology
 because
 you
 cannot


survive
 in
 that
 kind
 of
 environment


without
 any
 advanced
 technology


>> but
 I
 think
 that
 also
 a
 huge
 waste
 of


the
 taxpayers
 dollars,
 you
 know,
 like


the
 Oh,


>> for
 sure.


>> Those
 money
 could
 be
 spent
 on
 other
 more


productive
 um
 activity
 like
 investing
 in


the
 education
 or
 try
 to
 help
 improve
 the


um
 those
 farmers
 working
 environment,


try
 to
 improve
 those
 those
 people's


life.
 Um
 don't
 you
 think
 that
 part
 of


the
 reason
 for
 the
 low
 consumption
 is


also
 driven
 by
 this
 like
 the
 policy
 kind


of
 heavily
 tilts
 towards
 local


investment
 instead
 of
 like
 you
 know


>> absolutely
 that's
 absolutely
 the
 case.


Uh
 I
 mean
 this
 gets
 back
 to
 the
 point


that
 I
 made
 earlier
 about
 how
 basically


the
 state
 commandeers
 all
 of
 the


financial
 income
 country
 and
 directs
 it


to
 these
 investments


>> rather
 than
 allowing
 it
 to
 recirculate


through
 the
 economy
 the
 way
 it
 would
 in


a
 in
 a
 more
 market
 oriented
 system.
 So


so
 that
 is
 I
 think
 absolutely


uh
 at
 the
 heart
 of
 the
 question
 of
 the


investment
 consumption
 balance


and
 and
 also
 the
 growth
 rate.
 So
 the


thing
 that
 I've
 been
 sort
 of
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 for
 the
 last
 few
 years
 is


it's
 it's
 become
 very
 clear


that
 under
 Xiinping
 the
 Chinese


government
 is
 much
 less
 concerned
 about


maintaining
 a
 high
 economic
 growth
 rate


than
 previous
 leaders.
 Right.


>> Um
 and
 when
 they
 talk
 about
 development


it
 used
 to
 be
 that
 development
 meant
 a


high
 GDP
 growth
 rate.


>> Yeah.


under
 shiinping
 it
 means
 no
 it
 means


technology
 development


>> um
 and
 the
 growth
 rate
 has
 to
 be
 you


know
 a
 certain
 level
 but
 it
 doesn't
 have


to
 be
 that
 high
 right
 um


so
 we
 seem
 to
 be
 and
 they
 you
 know
 and


this
 is
 essentially
 what
 they
 have


achieved
 is
 an
 economy
 that
 is
 making


really
 impressive
 technological
 progress


in
 many
 fields
 but
 is
 growing
 a
 lot


slower


>> and
 if
 you
 read
 government
 documents
 on


this
 what
 they
 will
 tend
 to
 say
 is
 well


don't
 worry
 all
 this
 new
 technology
 will


produce
 enormous
 new
 productivity
 gains


and
 this
 will
 you
 know
 cause
 higher


growth
 in
 the
 future
 that's
 what
 they


say


>> um
 and
 the
 problem
 with
 that
 is
 that


most
 people
 in
 China
 do
 not
 work
 in
 the


technology
 industries
 right
 so
 what's


the
 combined
 employment
 of
 EVs


semiconductors
 industrial
 robotics


>> you
 know
 green
 energy
 all
 of
 these


things
 put
 together
 you
 know
 that
 might


be
 10%
 of
 the
 of
 the
 national
 workforce


Mhm.


>> Uh
 so
 in
 order
 for
 this
 to
 spill
 over


into
 um
 you
 know
 the
 the
 rest
 of
 the


economy
 where
 everyone
 else
 works,
 you


need
 to
 have
 some
 mechanism
 by
 which
 you


know
 the
 fact
 that
 you're
 really
 good
 at


making
 electric
 cars
 creates
 some


productivity
 benefit
 elsewhere
 in
 the


economy.
 And
 that
 that's
 where
 I
 start


scratching
 my
 head
 because
 I
 don't


really
 see
 the
 ability


um
 for
 technological


uh
 improvement
 uh
 to
 feed
 through
 into


sort
 of
 generally
 higher
 uh
 uh


productivity
 and
 higher
 wages
 for
 most


people,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 you
 did
 actually
 have
 a
 mechanism


for
 that
 essentially
 in
 the
 internet


sector,
 right?
 for
 for
 10
 or
 15
 years


you
 had
 these
 great
 companies
 like


Alibaba
 and
 Tencent
 and
 so
 forth
 that


were
 technological
 innovators
 and
 also


gigantic
 employers
 and
 they
 were


essentially
 selling
 consumer
 services.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 so
 there
 you
 could
 see
 a
 lot
 of


spillovers
 between
 the
 technology
 that


they
 were
 developing
 and
 and
 broader


gains
 income.
 Uh
 and
 that
 is
 is
 much


less
 the
 case
 now.
 So,
 China
 is
 now
 kind


of
 I
 think
 a
 bifurcated
 place
 where
 the


technology
 uh
 economy
 is
 overperforming


>> doing
 very
 very
 well.
 Um
 and
 the
 over


the
 the
 total
 economy,
 the
 macro
 economy


is
 underperforming.


>> Uh
 and
 I
 don't
 really
 see
 a
 reason
 for


that
 to
 change
 in
 the
 next
 seven
 years.


I
 don't
 think
 China
 is
 suddenly
 going
 to


get
 a
 much
 faster
 growth
 rate.
 I
 don't


think
 consumption
 is
 going
 to


accelerate,
 but
 nor
 do
 I
 think
 that
 the


technology
 progress
 is
 going
 to
 slow


down.
 It's
 just
 this
 kind
 of
 weird


combination
 of
 extreme
 technological


competence,
 a
 lot
 of
 success
 in


individual
 sectors
 in
 an
 overall
 economy


that
 that
 always
 feels
 a
 little
 bit


sluggish.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 uh
 that
 actually
 bring
 up
 to


the
 next
 question
 which
 is
 very


interesting
 because
 Professor
 Shu


predicts
 that
 China
 is
 going
 to
 face
 a


long-term
 stagnation
 because
 the


Communist
 Party
 will
 not
 give
 up


control.
 Um,
 and
 Professor
 Ching
 kind
 of


argued
 that
 like
 there's
 no


accountability
 for
 welfare
 and
 the


Chinese
 people
 did
 not
 demand
 the


government
 deliver
 like
 social
 socialist


promise
 that
 will
 kind
 of
 lead
 to
 this


long
 stagnation
 for
 the
 country.
 Do
 you


think
 that
 prediction
 is
 holds
 any


water?
 Like
 do
 you
 think
 that
 argument


is
 u
 sound?
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 both
 of
 those


critiques
 are,
 you
 know,
 we
 need
 to
 take


them
 quite
 seriously
 because
 I
 think


they
 they
 put
 their
 finger
 on,
 you
 know,


some
 pretty
 real
 problems,
 right?
 So


yeah,
 there's
 no
 question
 that
 I
 mean


looking
 at
 Professor
 Shu's


um
 uh
 stagnation
 thesis


um
 the
 increase
 in
 state
 control


um


and
 the
 the
 efficiency
 cost
 of
 just
 like


channeling
 huge
 amounts
 of
 money
 into


these


investments
 that
 on
 average
 are
 very
 low


productivity.
 All
 of
 that,
 you
 know,


creates,
 I
 think,
 a
 greater
 risk
 of


stagnation.
 And
 and
 you
 could
 argue
 that


there
 were
 sort
 of
 there
 already.


>> So
 China,
 people
 talk
 about
 real
 growth


rates.
 So
 this
 is
 growth
 rates


accounting
 for,
 you
 know,
 inflation.
 So


normally
 if
 you
 have
 like
 an
 economy
 is


growing
 by
 three
 and
 inflation
 is
 two,


that
 means
 that
 your
 real
 growth
 rate
 is


only
 one
 because
 you
 have
 to
 subtract


the
 inflation
 rate
 from
 the
 from
 the


from
 the
 nominal
 growth
 rate,
 right?


Um
 in
 chi
 China
 has
 the
 opposite
 now
 the


the
 the


nominal
 economy
 is
 growing
 by
 like
 three


and
 a
 half
 or
 4%.
 The
 prices
 are
 falling


by
 1%.
 So
 they
 claim
 oh
 we
 have
 real


growth
 of
 5%.


>> But
 that
 5%
 you
 know
 one
 percentage


point
 of
 it
 is
 just
 coming
 from
 falling


prices.


>> Yeah.


>> Not
 from
 increased
 activity.
 Um
 so
 in


nominal
 terms
 China
 has
 been
 growing


slower
 than
 the
 United
 States
 for
 the


last
 four
 years.
 Mhm.


>> Which
 is
 kind
 of
 staggering
 when
 you


consider
 that
 they
 were
 growing,


>> you
 know,
 way
 faster
 than
 the
 United


States
 for
 many
 years.


>> China's
 economy
 relative
 to
 the
 US


peaked
 in
 2020,
 I
 think,
 at
 about
 75%.


It's
 now
 down
 to
 about
 65%.
 So
 China's


economy
 in
 total
 compared
 to
 the
 US
 is


smaller
 than
 it
 was


>> five
 years
 ago.
 Um,


so
 you
 could
 argue
 if
 you
 wanted
 to
 that


China
 is
 already
 in
 a
 sense
 stagnating.


Now


that
 would
 be
 an
 exaggeration
 because


it's
 still
 growing.


>> Yeah.


>> Um,
 you
 know,
 pretty
 fast
 um
 by
 any


standard.
 Um,
 so
 that's
 not
 stagnation


in
 my
 book
 would
 be
 it's
 not
 growing
 at


all
 and
 it's


>> it's
 clearly
 growing,
 right?
 Um


but
 there's
 you
 know
 the
 the
 the
 dynamic


that
 exists
 now
 is
 one
 where
 growth
 is
 a


lot
 lower
 than
 it
 should
 be


>> or
 could
 be.
 Uh
 and
 the
 longer
 that
 goes


on
 I
 think
 the
 more
 risk
 that
 that


creates
 you
 know
 perhaps.


>> Yes.


>> So
 I
 I
 you
 know
 as
 I
 said
 I'm
 I'm
 much


more
 bullish
 than
 than
 Shu
 Changong
 you


know
 on
 China
 visa
 v
 Japan
 or
 the
 Soviet


Union
 or
 any
 of these
 other
 comparisons.


I
 think
 they
 have
 a
 lot
 going
 for
 them.


Track
 record
 is
 very
 good.
 Um,
 but
 the


the
 risk
 of


an
 economy
 that
 that
 over
 a
 long
 period


of
 time
 and
 here
 I
 would
 say
 you
 need
 to


be
 talking
 about
 10
 20
 years.


>> All
 of
 this
 inefficiency
 starts
 to
 catch


up
 with
 it.
 Yeah,
 that
 that
 risk
 is


there,
 right?
 But
 but
 again,
 this
 is
 not


something
 that's
 going
 to
 happen
 in
 the


next
 one,
 two,
 three,
 five
 years.
 This


is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 much
 longer
 term


dynamic.
 Um
 and
 then
 um
 the
 uh
 the
 other


uh
 case
 was


>> professor
 chain.
 Yeah.
 He
 argued
 that


like
 the
 if
 the
 China
 want
 to
 get
 out
 of


this
 current
 situation
 they
 have
 to


increase
 the
 welfare
 share.
 Right.


>> Right.
 So
 that's
 I
 think
 that's
 an


interesting
 argument
 and
 the
 counter
 to


that


>> is
 that
 you
 know
 I
 have
 a
 one
 of
 my


clients
 in
 the
 financial
 industry
 who


recently
 put
 it
 to
 me
 this
 way.
 He
 said,


"Look,
 you
 know,
 you
 look
 at
 the
 United


States


and
 this
 is
 an
 economy
 that
 is
 optimized


for
 the
 top
 20%
 of
 the
 income."


>> So,
 if
 you're
 in
 the
 top
 20%,


America
 is
 great.


>> You
 can
 do
 whatever
 you
 want,
 make
 lots


of
 money,
 uh
 you're
 very
 secure,
 you


can,
 you
 know,
 invest,
 make
 big
 returns,


it's
 excellent,
 right?
 If
 you're
 lower


down
 in
 the
 income
 scale,
 it's
 not
 so


great,
 right?
 But
 for
 the
 top
 20%,
 it's


fantastic.
 Right?
 China,
 his
 point
 was,


is
 the
 opposite,
 right?
 For
 the
 20th
 or


the
 30th
 percentile
 of
 income,
 life
 is


fine,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> Um,
 you
 have
 a
 house.
 Uh,


>> most
 things
 don't
 cost
 very
 much.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh,
 if
 you
 live
 in
 the
 cities,
 social


welfare
 provision
 is
 not
 fantastic,
 but


it's
 not
 horrible.
 There
 are,
 you
 know,


the
 health
 care
 system
 is
 much
 better


than
 it
 was.
 Decent
 education
 for
 your


kids.
 Uh,
 your
 retirement
 is
 basically


taken
 care
 of.
 They're
 universal


pensions.
 They're
 not
 fantastic,
 but


they're
 there.
 Don't
 really
 have
 to


worry
 about
 much.
 And
 um
 and
 I
 think


that's
 a
 very
 good
 point,
 right?
 That


the
 system
 that
 has
 been
 created,
 yeah,


in
 terms
 of
 a
 formal
 social
 welfare


system,
 it's
 not
 like
 the
 United
 States


or
 Europe
 by
 any
 means.
 Mh.


>> Um,
 but
 in
 terms
 of
 creating
 a
 sense
 of


security
 and
 and
 sort
 of
 provision
 for
 a


large
 majority
 of
 of
 its
 people,
 it


works
 pretty
 well.
 Mhm.


>> Um,
 so
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 sure
 that
 Chinuay
 is


quite
 right
 in
 saying
 that
 uh
 the
 the


overall


social
 welfare
 system
 in
 China
 is
 as
 bad


as
 you
 know
 like
 to
 argue.


>> I
 I
 do
 think
 though
 that
 if
 you
 if
 you


optimize
 in
 that
 way,
 you
 are
 creating


some
 perverse
 incentives,
 right?
 Um,
 and


basically
 what
 you're
 telling
 the


majority
 of
 your
 population
 right
 now


is,


okay,
 you've
 got
 an
 okay
 life.
 Uh,
 and


there
 isn't
 going
 to
 be
 that
 much


growth,
 but


>> we
 order
 you
 to
 be
 fine
 with
 it.


>> Yeah.


And
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 for
 a
 lot
 of


people
 it's
 like,
 okay,
 I'll
 take
 that


deal
 because
 the
 reality
 is
 my
 life
 is


okay


>> and
 okay,
 I
 I
 can't
 expect
 the
 same
 sort


of
 growth
 that
 I
 would
 have
 a
 year
 or


two
 ago.
 But


>> yeah,


>> um


>> but
 that's
 fine.
 I
 I
 can
 live
 with
 that


deal.
 Mhm.


>> Um
 but
 if
 you
 have
 if
 you
 if
 you
 make


most
 of
 your
 population
 live
 with
 the


deal
 where
 they
 just
 lose
 that


aspiration
 for
 making
 things
 better,
 I


think
 that
 gets
 you
 back
 into
 this
 this


stagnation
 question.
 What
 is
 the


incentive
 for
 people
 to
 work
 really
 hard


and
 try
 to
 improve
 things
 if
 they're
 not


going
 to
 get
 anything
 out
 of
 it?
 Mhm.


>> Um
 and
 so
 I
 think
 there
 is
 a
 risk
 there


that
 the
 that
 the
 way
 that
 they
 have


chosen
 to
 organize
 the
 system


>> um
 creates


more
 incentives
 for
 more
 people
 over


time
 to
 just
 kind
 of
 check
 out
 the


system.


>> They
 call
 it
 lay
 flat
 like


>> Right.
 That's
 right.
 It's
 right.


Exactly.
 It's
 the
 tongue
 ping
 um
 you


know
 phenomenon.
 Exactly.
 which
 I
 think


is
 in
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 current
 meme
 I


think
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 overstated


because
 there's
 plenty
 of
 people
 who
 are


not
 mind
 flat
 but


>> but
 the
 you
 know
 I
 think
 that
 the


incentive
 structure
 is
 in
 the
 Chinese


economy
 is
 now
 a
 little
 bit


questionable.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 the
 incentive
 structure
 for


entrepreneurship
 is
 clearly
 much
 weaker


than
 it
 was
 say
 10
 years
 ago.


>> Oh
 yeah.
 I
 I
 would
 definitely
 agree
 with


that
 because
 like
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 uh


venture
 capitalists
 in
 China
 they


shouldn't
 be
 called
 venture
 capitalists.


They're
 actually
 venture
 debt
 because


you
 have
 to
 sign
 agreement.


If
 your
 company
 fails,
 you
 have
 to
 buy


back
 all
 the
 share.
 Basically,
 you're


put
 on
 a
 huge
 loans,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 we
 could
 have
 a
 whole


separate
 conversation
 about
 the
 VC


system
 in
 China,
 which
 is
 like
 complete


mess.
 But


>> yeah,


>> uh
 uh
 but
 yeah,
 so
 that's
 I
 I
 think


there
 are
 there
 are
 definitely
 risks


there.
 I
 would
 just
 say


my
 my
 basic
 response
 to
 both
 uh
 Chinu


and
 Shu
 Jang
 on
 this
 would
 be
 that
 um


the
 the
 risks
 are
 are
 real


>> uh
 and
 I
 think
 they
 are
 it's
 kind
 of
 at


the
 margin
 rising
 but
 they
 are
 very
 very


slow
 to
 I
 I
 think
 really
 have
 a
 material


impact
 on
 Chinese
 momentum.


>> Yeah,
 there's
 another
 U
 professor
 called


his
 name
 is
 Dong
 Shan.
 So
 he
 recently


did
 a
 podcast.
 He's
 arguing
 that
 the


Chinese
 government
 should
 actually
 give


out
 UBI
 like
 basically
 give
 all
 the


young
 people
 like
 uh
 money
 to
 spend


because
 I
 think
 like
 the
 system
 is


really
 not
 fair
 to
 them
 like
 that's
 like


a
 compensation
 and
 also
 encourage
 them


to
 have
 babies
 and
 all
 this
 stuff.
 Do
 do


you
 think
 that
 Chinese
 government
 can
 do


that
 and
 will
 do
 that?
 I
 mean


>> well
 they
 they
 could
 if
 they
 wanted
 to


because
 they
 control
 the
 financial


system.
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 they
 will
 and


personally
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 they


should.
 Right.
 So


to
 me,
 the
 way
 that
 these


problems
 get
 addressed
 is


basically
 more
 flexibility
 in
 the


financial
 system.


>> That
 allows


hardens
 the
 budget
 constraints,
 right?


>> So
 you
 have
 a
 financial
 system
 that


really
 punishes
 the
 the
 companies
 that


that
 can't,
 you
 know,
 survive
 and
 they


go
 out
 of
 business.


um
 and
 conversely
 rewards
 the
 companies


that
 do
 really
 well,
 right?
 Uh
 and


rewards
 the
 investors
 who
 put
 that


capital
 at
 risk,
 right?
 So
 this
 is
 the


whole
 point
 about
 the
 way
 that
 the
 state


commandeers
 all
 financial
 income
 and


moves
 it
 where
 it
 wants.
 where
 China
 was


actually
 moving
 up
 until
 about
 2017
 was


to
 decentralize
 the
 financial
 system
 and


create
 a
 more
 um
 sort
 of
 consumer


oriented
 uh
 financial
 and
 capital


allocation
 system


>> and
 that
 clearly
 had
 significant
 risks


attached
 to
 it.
 But
 from
 a
 standpoint
 of


improving
 household
 welfare
 and
 making


you
 know


people
 economically
 better
 off
 I
 think


that
 was
 the
 way
 to
 go.
 the
 and
 the
 the


point
 there
 is
 that
 that's
 a
 dynamic


sort
 of
 market
 driven
 system
 not
 the


government
 saying
 okay
 we
 the
 government


will
 decide
 that
 you
 will
 now
 have
 a


basic
 income
 of
 X
 right


>> I
 don't
 think
 that
 that
 really
 changes


anyone's
 incentives
 at
 all


>> uh
 it
 it's
 basically
 that
 would
 just
 be


a
 sort
 of
 a
 continuation
 of
 the
 existing


sort
 of
 commandoriented


system
 so
 even
 if
 they
 did
 it
 I
 don't


think
 it
 would
 have
 that
 much
 impact


because
 I
 don't
 think
 people
 it
 would


really
 change
 people's
 incentives
 that


much
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> But
 I
 don't
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 do


it.


>> Okay.


I
 I
 think
 um
 both
 Shu
 andQing
 are
 very


um
 pessimistic
 and
 also
 they
 have
 a


deterministic


view
 about
 China's
 future,
 right?
 Like


they
 think
 China
 is
 like
 the
 train
 on
 a


track
 that
 kind
 of
 heading
 toward
 that


destiny
 uh
 no
 matter
 what
 you
 do,
 right?


But
 I
 think
 you're
 more
 bullish
 on
 that.


You
 think
 like
 Chinese
 economy
 is
 more


resil
 resilience
 compared
 to
 what
 they


perceived,
 right?
 Can
 you
 give
 us
 a
 like


maybe
 u
 just
 like
 a
 forecast
 or
 your


your
 view
 on
 like
 ne
 maybe
 in
 the
 next


two
 to
 three
 years
 like
 how
 the
 China


economy
 would
 be


>> behave
 or
 even
 the
 cap
 uh
 the
 I
 would


say
 like
 there
 people
 people
 often
 like


uh
 want
 to
 ask
 like
 how
 the
 Chinese


stock
 market
 perform
 right
 like
 that


okay


>> perspective


>> so
 okay
 so
 the
 first
 thing
 I
 will
 say
 is


I
 really
 hate
 being
 described
 as
 a
 China


bull


>> because
 I
 I
 don't
 partly


Partly
 that's
 just
 the
 aesthetic.
 Partly


it's
 because
 I
 don't
 view
 my
 role
 as


being,
 you
 know,
 to
 take
 sides
 in
 for
 it


or
 you
 against
 it,
 right?
 Which
 is


>> um
 I've
 always
 described
 myself
 as
 a


skeptical
 optimist.


>> Yeah.


>> Meaning,
 so
 the
 optimism
 is
 that
 I
 have


very
 high
 conviction
 in
 um
 in
 the
 the


kind
 of
 underlying
 strengths
 and


resilience
 and
 adaptability
 of
 the
 uh


Chinese
 system.


>> Mhm.
 Um


uh
 so
 and
 this
 I
 I
 should
 also
 be
 clear


that
 because
 I'm
 optimistic
 at
 core
 on


the
 economy,
 this
 does
 not
 mean
 that
 I


uh
 uh
 give
 approval
 to
 the
 political


system.
 Those
 are
 two
 completely


different
 questions,
 right?
 Yeah.


>> Which
 often
 get
 mixed
 up.
 And
 I
 think


it's
 perfectly
 possible
 to
 say
 on
 one


hand
 these
 guys
 really
 know
 how
 to
 run


an
 economy
 um
 and
 are
 very
 successful
 at


mobilizing
 and
 deploying
 resources


uh
 to
 achieve
 you
 know
 impressive


economic
 ends.
 Um
 that
 is
 one
 question


and
 what
 would
 be
 my
 value
 judgment
 on


the
 the
 right
 political
 system
 that's
 a


completely
 different
 question.


>> I
 know
 so
 understood.
 Uh
 so
 I
 want
 to
 be


careful
 about
 those
 two
 stipulations.


And
 so
 um
 the
 skeptical
 part
 is
 that


you
 know
 there
 are
 always
 huge
 problems


in
 China
 and
 as
 we've
 discussed
 you
 know


even
 though
 I
 disagree
 with
 some
 of
 the


conclusions
 of
 the
 of
 the
 scholars
 that


you've
 cited


>> you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 analysis
 is
 spoton


right
 there
 are
 really
 really
 difficult


>> um
 structural
 abiding
 problems


>> um
 which
 reduce
 efficiency


uh
 create
 bad
 incentives
 uh
 both
 at
 the


government
 level
 and
 at
 at
 the
 company


level.
 And
 if
 these
 are
 allowed
 to


fester,
 yeah,
 they
 over
 time
 uh
 they


could
 cause
 the
 economy
 to
 perform
 much


much
 worse
 than
 it
 has
 in
 the
 past.


Right.
 And
 when
 you
 when
 you
 put
 on
 top


of
 that
 things
 like
 there's
 a
 big
 big


demographic
 problem,
 you
 know,
 China


benefited
 enormously
 from
 having
 a
 young


population.
 It's
 now
 aging
 very
 quickly.


>> Yeah.
 the
 the
 average
 age
 in
 China
 in
 in


about
 15
 years
 will
 be
 higher
 than
 in


Japan.


>> Yeah.


>> Which
 is
 staggering.
 Um
 so
 um
 so


whenever
 you
 see
 problems
 of
 that


magnitude,
 you
 can
 say
 okay
 in
 the
 past


they've
 done
 a
 great
 job
 of
 dealing
 with


their
 problems
 but
 um
 can
 they
 keep
 it


up?
 Maybe
 yes,
 maybe
 no,
 right?


>> Uh
 and
 what
 are
 they
 doing
 to
 address


the
 institutional
 constraints
 that


they're
 putting
 on
 themselves?
 Right?


But
 if
 I
 had
 to
 um
 you
 know
 and
 as
 I've


said
 before
 my
 my
 basic
 view
 right
 now


is
 that
 China
 has
 a
 great
 tech
 economy


and
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 mediocre
 macroeconomy.


>> Um
 and
 so
 my
 I
 would
 do
 forecasts
 but
 my


expectation
 would
 be
 you
 know
 China's


been
 growing
 by


in
 real
 terms
 around
 four
 four
 to
 5%
 in


nominal
 terms
 around
 3
 to
 4%.


I
 think
 that
 basically
 continues
 for
 the


next
 few
 years.
 Mhm.


>> Um


which
 is
 an
 okay
 result
 but
 not


terrific.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 if
 you
 look
 at


the
 technology
 ecosystem,
 it
 is
 very


impressive
 and
 I
 think
 is
 going
 to
 you


know
 expand
 into
 new
 sectors
 and
 Chinese


companies
 are
 beun
 become
 much
 more


globally
 important.
 Uh
 so
 I'm
 quite


bullish
 if
 you
 will
 on
 China's
 uh
 the


ability
 of
 the
 top
 Chinese
 companies
 to


you
 know
 attain
 leading


>> positions
 in
 an
 increasing
 number
 of


technology
 intensive
 industries
 right
 I


think
 that's
 very
 very
 clear
 and
 the
 the


the
 sort
 of
 counter
 forces
 to
 that


whether
 it's
 protectionism
 or
 friend


shoring
 or
 industrial
 policy
 elsewhere


>> it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 very
 very
 long
 time


uh
 before
 those
 kinds
 of
 countermeasures


have
 have
 impact.
 But
 China's
 got
 I


think
 very
 strong
 um
 uh
 capacities


there.
 So
 the
 the
 question
 I
 have
 in
 my


mind
 is
 like,
 okay,
 you've
 got
 this


great
 tech
 ecosystem,


but
 it's
 an
 ecosystem
 that
 kind
 of


exists
 in
 a
 bubble


>> and
 most
 of
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 Chinese


economy
 where
 people
 live


doesn't
 benefit
 that
 much
 from
 this


fantastic
 tech
 ecosystem.
 So
 to
 me
 the


big
 question
 is
 how
 can
 you
 get
 these


two
 things


more
 integrated


and
 how
 can
 you
 have
 wider
 benefits


through
 the
 economy
 as
 a
 whole
 from
 this


great
 tech
 progress
 that
 they're
 making


and
 I
 don't
 really
 frankly
 see
 that
 the


government
 is
 a
 great
 answer
 that
 way


they
 they
 basically
 seem
 satisfied
 with


>> the
 current
 the
 current
 situation
 and


they
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 you
 know
 keep


keep
 things
 on
 track
 and
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


think
 that
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 has


really
 any
 ability
 to
 throw
 it
 off


track.
 China
 is
 very
 self-sufficient.


Um,
 so
 I'm
 not
 sure
 if
 that's
 a
 bull


case,
 but
 that
 would
 be
 the
 case
 for
 um,


uh,
 you
 know,
 not
 underestimating
 the


adaptability
 of
 the
 Chinese
 corporate


system.
 And
 and
 I
 guess
 the
 final
 thing


I
 would
 say
 is
 that
 even
 if
 you
 look
 at


the
 at
 the
 political
 system,
 there
 have


been
 some
 some
 adaptations.
 And
 so
 I


think


>> one
 of
 she's
 Xi
 Jinping's


characteristics
 as
 a
 leader
 is
 that
 he


is
 more
 rigid


than
 his
 predecessors.


>> Uh
 once
 he
 decides
 a
 thing
 is
 correct
 he


sticks
 with
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> For
 a
 very
 long
 time
 even
 after
 the


evidence
 piles
 up
 that
 he
 needs
 he's


much
 more
 resistant
 to
 course
 correction


>> than
 any
 of
 the
 previous
 three
 uh
 major


leaders
 that
 we
 had.
 Um
 and
 that's
 a


problem.
 If
 you
 have
 a
 rigidity
 in
 the


system,
 that
 means
 that
 inefficiency
 is


built
 up
 rather
 than
 being
 dissipated.


But
 but
 he
 has
 made
 some
 course


corrections.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 he
 has
 recognized
 that
 there


needed
 to
 be
 more
 support.
 They're
 doing


some
 things
 that
 are
 a
 little
 bit
 more


household
 friendly.


You
 know,
 they're
 not
 gigantic,
 but
 you


know,
 so
 I
 I
 think
 we
 can
 maybe
 over
 we


can
 exaggerate
 how
 rigid
 the
 system
 is.


It's
 still
 more
 rigid
 than
 it
 used
 to


be.


But
 again,
 what's
 your
 anchor
 here?
 Is


your
 anchor
 what
 is
 China
 today
 versus


the
 China
 of
 10
 or
 15
 years
 ago?


>> Or
 what
 is
 China
 today
 versus
 any
 other


country
 that's
 out
 there?


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 If
 you
 take
 the
 first
 comparison,


it's
 like
 uh
 yeah,
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of


things
 that
 today
 that
 are
 not
 as
 good


in
 China
 as
 they
 were
 10
 years
 ago.


>> There's
 some
 that
 are
 better,
 but


there's
 some
 that
 are
 worse,
 right?
 But


if
 you
 look
 at
 China
 compared
 to
 most


other
 countries
 in
 the
 world,
 still


stacks
 up
 pretty
 well.
 And
 their
 ability


to
 adjust
 and
 to
 push
 resources
 where


they're
 needed
 um
 is
 still
 remarkable.


uh
 and
 as
 long
 as
 that
 systemic


adjustment
 capacity
 remains
 strong


um
 then
 it's
 hard
 to
 see


China
 sliding
 into
 the
 kind
 of
 extreme


stagnation
 or
 sclerosis
 that
 you
 know


some
 of
 the
 some
 of
 the
 critics
 would


say
 in
 the
 short
 run


>> short
 run
 meaning
 the
 next
 five
 years


>> that's
 the
 reason
 the
 bull
 here
 I
 have
 a


quote
 here
 it's
 not
 like
 a
 solid


I
 I
 think
 like
 uh
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you


read
 the
 article
 I
 remember
 like
 two


years
 ago
 maybe
 that's
 the
 bottom
 of
 the


Chinese
 equity
 uh
 basically
 I
 think
 one


analyst
 come
 out
 of
 I
 can't
 remember
 is


that
 JP
 Morgan
 or
 Goldman
 Sachs
 he


basically
 says
 the
 headline
 is
 that


Chinese
 equity
 is
 not
 investable
 and
 I


think
 that
 marked
 the
 low
 of
 the
 the


market
 right


>> yes
 that's
 right
 and
 I'm
 not
 a
 I'm
 not


like
 a
 markets
 guy
 or
 market
 strategist


but
 um


>> yeah
 I
 mean
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 you


see
 in
 markets
 is
 that
 people
 sort
 of


take
 these
 very
 extreme
 positions.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 Right.


>> Uh
 you
 know
 and
 it's
 just
 like
 the
 last


two
 years
 that
 has
 not
 been
 the
 case.


The
 stock
 Morgan
 has
 done
 very
 well
 and


you
 know
 people
 have
 recognized
 that


it's
 not
 Japan,
 it's
 not
 the
 Soviet


Union.


>> Um


>> and
 and
 you
 have
 to
 take
 it
 in
 a


somewhat
 more
 nuanced
 way.


>> I
 I
 agree.


>> So
 that's
 that's
 healthy.


>> Yeah.
 I
 actually
 read
 an
 article
 uh


actually
 um
 early
 last
 year
 I
 think
 end


of
 the
 year
 before
 last
 year
 is
 um


basically
 saying
 like
 Moody's
 came
 out


and
 argue
 that
 all
 the
 Chinese
 credit


situation
 and
 all
 the
 small
 business


particular
 manufacturing
 sectors
 the


worst
 part
 is
 behind
 us
 even
 though
 the


recovery
 is
 super
 slow
 and
 uncertain
 but


like
 uh
 it's
 no
 longer
 that
 in
 the
 sho


you
 know
 like
 basically
 that
 kind
 of


>> yeah
 correlated
 with
 the
 market
 reaction


you
 know
 in
 the
 in
 the
 equity


Right.
 I
 think
 there's
 actually
 there's


a
 sort
 of
 I
 would
 broadly
 agree
 with


that
 assessment.
 It's
 always
 a
 little


bit
 par
 perilous
 to
 say
 ah
 we've
 hit
 the


bottom.


>> It's
 only
 up
 from
 here.


>> Um
 but
 the
 other
 interesting
 thing
 is
 if


you
 look
 at
 um


uh
 just
 credit
 flows
 into
 manufacturing


these
 expanded
 by
 a
 factor
 of
 six


between
 2019
 and
 2023.
 Mhm.


>> So
 there
 was
 a
 six-fold
 increase
 in
 bank


loans
 to
 manufacturing


which
 was
 the
 counterpart
 of
 the
 fact


that
 the
 banks
 were
 no
 longer
 lending
 to


property.
 So
 they,
 you
 know,
 they


stopped
 lending
 to
 property
 and
 they


poured
 all
 of
 their
 lending
 into


manufacturing.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 people


sometimes
 ask,
 okay,
 why
 do
 you
 have
 so


much
 excess
 capacity
 in
 China?
 And


partly
 the
 answer
 is,
 duh.


>> There
 was
 a
 six-fold
 increase
 in
 lending


to
 manufacturers.
 So
 money
 was
 free
 for


anyone
 who
 wanted
 to
 sit
 on
 the
 main


franch.
 So
 So
 of
 course
 you
 got
 excess


capacity,
 right?


>> Now
 what's
 interesting
 though
 is
 that


peaked
 in
 2023.


>> Mhm.


>> Uh
 and
 it
 fell
 in
 half


in
 2024
 and
 it's
 roughly
 at
 that
 level


today.
 So
 there
 is
 there
 are
 tightening


financial
 conditions
 in
 um
 uh
 in
 China


that
 I
 think
 actually
 are
 going
 to
 have


started
 to
 show
 an
 impact
 in


>> winnowing
 out
 uh
 some
 of
 this
 excessive


competition.
 And
 it
 takes
 a
 long
 time


because
 the
 local
 governments
 also
 play


a
 role.
 But
 if
 the
 banks
 are
 no
 longer


willing
 to
 pour
 money
 into
 these


sectors,
 eventually
 people
 will
 start
 to


fall
 by
 the
 wayside
 with
 some


consolidation.
 But
 it'll
 be
 it'll
 be


slow.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 also
 have
 some
 uh
 I
 actually


did
 a
 advertisement
 of
 this
 podcast


happening.
 So
 some
 of
 my
 viewers
 uh


raised
 some
 questions
 and
 I'm
 going
 to


go
 over
 some
 of
 those
 questions.
 Uh
 one


of
 the
 question
 is
 uh
 I
 think
 from
 the


the
 contest
 I
 can
 tell
 like
 he
 probably


is
 a
 young
 professional
 in
 China
 like


kind
 of
 working
 that
 tough
 uh
 job


market.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> So
 he's
 just
 saying
 that
 you
 know
 um


currently
 young
 people
 are
 just
 laying


fat
 flat
 right
 just
 like
 doing
 nothing


and
 be
 have
 a
 very
 low
 desire
 so
 you


don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 consumption
 probably


never
 get
 married
 or
 have
 kids
 and
 you


know
 just
 like
 stay
 a
 very
 low
 profile


life
 um
 that
 actually
 comes
 into
 a
 very


dramatic
 contrast
 compared
 to
 the
 on
 the


news
 you
 see
 like
 China's
 neck


competition
 on
 the
 high-tech
 area
 right


so
 right
 um
 his
 question
 is
 are
 we


really
 looking
 at
 a
 permanent
 disconnect


where
 the
 state
 become
 super
 high
 tech,


you
 know,
 the
 superpower,
 but
 the


average
 citizen
 just
 left
 behind
 with
 no


way
 up.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 it's
 it's
 a
 great
 question,


you
 know,
 and
 I
 think
 on
 all
 of
 these


things,
 you
 know,
 China
 is
 a
 big
 country


and
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 things


going
 on,
 right?
 Um,
 so
 depending
 which


piece
 you
 choose
 to
 look
 at,
 you
 can


come
 away
 with
 totally,
 you
 know,


different
 things.
 So
 if
 you
 if
 you
 spend


your
 time
 like
 in
 Shenzhen


>> going
 around
 to
 all
 these
 companies
 and


seeing
 all
 the
 people
 and
 how
 hard


they're
 working
 say
 yeah


>> no
 no
 one's
 lying
 flat
 here
 right


>> yeah
 exactly


>> then
 get
 up
 but
 then
 you
 go
 elsewhere


and
 yes
 there
 are
 this
 is
 clearly


clearly
 an
 issue


>> um
 you
 know
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 terrific


answer
 to
 that
 other
 than
 to
 kind
 of


repeat
 what
 I
 said
 earlier
 which
 is
 that


there
 there
 is
 clearly
 there's
 this


disconnect
 between
 the
 vibrant
 tech


economy
 and
 large
 swaths
 of
 the
 rest
 of


the
 economy.
 Um
 and


uh
 there
 isn't
 a
 lot
 of
 benefit
 in
 most


of
 the
 country


>> in
 most
 of
 the
 job
 market
 particularly


um
 from
 these
 you
 know
 these
 great
 tech


industries.
 So
 for
 example


the
 net
 number
 of
 jobs
 that
 has
 been


created
 in
 Chinese
 manufacturing
 in
 the


last
 10
 years
 is
 negative.


>> Yeah.
 So
 even
 as
 China's
 taken
 over
 the


world
 in
 all
 the
 sectors,
 there
 are


fewer
 people
 working
 in
 manufacturing


today
 than
 there
 were
 10
 years
 ago,


right?
 Um
 all
 new
 job
 creation
 is
 in
 the


service
 sector


>> and
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 jobs
 are


very
 uninspiring
 and
 you
 know
 you
 don't


see
 a
 lot
 of


>> you
 know
 progress.
 So
 no,
 I
 think
 I


think
 that's
 that's
 a
 problem.
 And
 I


think
 from
 a
 from
 a
 social,


you
 know,
 from
 a
 social
 standpoint,


uh
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 tough
 in
 China.
 I


think
 particularly
 if
 you
 are
 under
 30


in
 China,
 it
 is
 really
 tough.
 It
 is


probably
 the
 toughest
 toughest
 it
 has


ever
 been


>> in
 all
 the
 years
 that
 I've
 been
 there


because
 even
 like
 in
 the
 90s


>> when
 people
 forget
 it
 was
 pretty
 tough.


Um
 there
 were
 people
 working
 for


stateowned
 enterprises.
 They
 laid
 off


tens
 of
 millions
 of
 them.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 it
 was
 the
 the
 new
 economy
 hadn't


really
 fully
 taken
 off.
 You
 know,
 they


had
 to
 create
 20
 million
 new
 jobs
 a
 year


just
 to
 keep
 everyone
 employed.


>> Yeah.


>> It
 was
 it
 was
 it
 was
 hard
 to
 be
 a
 young


person
 back
 in
 the
 90s.
 But
 then
 at


least
 you
 had
 a
 sense
 that
 things
 were


going
 someplace,


>> getting
 better.
 Yeah,


>> if
 you
 put
 in
 some
 effort,
 it
 would
 pay


off.
 And
 now
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 true


that,
 you
 know,
 for
 an
 increasing
 number


of
 people,
 they
 don't
 get
 the
 sense
 that


there's
 a
 payoff
 to
 effort.
 So
 why


bother,
 right?


>> So
 I,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 think


I
 don't
 have
 a
 great
 answer
 to
 that.
 I
 I


think,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


totality
 of
 China,
 I
 think
 there
 are


more
 people
 not
 lying
 flat
 than
 than
 are


lying
 flat.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 but
 again
 this
 is
 I
 think
 one


of
 the
 risks
 that's
 that's
 out
 there.


>> I
 agree.
 I
 I
 was
 actually
 in
 uh
 Shenzhen


last
 uh
 October
 and
 uh
 the
 company
 I


visit
 they
 are
 having
 a
 meeting
 at
 about


12:00
 at
 night.
 I
 was
 like
 you
 guys
 are


crazy.
 I'm
 going
 back
 to
 hotel.
 And
 they


were
 saying


yeah
 the
 the
 owner
 said
 like
 yeah
 I'm


going
 to
 send
 you
 uh
 with
 my
 uh
 driver


but
 I'm
 going
 to
 stay
 here
 and
 have
 a


board
 meeting
 with
 on
 my
 uh
 partner.
 I


was
 like,
 "Okay,
 great."
 Like
 he
 he


thinks
 he's
 doing
 really
 well,
 so
 he's


apparently
 not
 laying
 flat.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> The
 next
 question
 I
 think
 like
 it's
 very


interesting
 because
 I
 know
 you
 observe


um
 Chinese
 economies
 through
 your
 lens


as
 a
 journalist
 and
 also
 as
 a


consultant,
 right?
 You
 have
 your
 own


firm
 kind
 of
 doing
 the
 uh
 analysis.


>> Uh
 however,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 criticize


about
 like
 the
 Chinese
 government
 data.


They
 say,
 "Oh,
 like
 your
 your
 GDP
 growth


doesn't
 align
 with
 the
 investment


figures.
 Your
 export
 data
 is


contradicting
 all
 the
 trading
 partners


importing
 data.
 You're
 just
 like
 making


the
 data
 up."


>> Um,
 do
 you
 think
 that
 that's
 like
 a


reasonable
 critic?
 And
 uh
 they
 compare


that
 to
 uh
 Soviet
 Union
 because
 Soviet


Union
 apparently
 made
 up
 some
 numbers


like
 through
 their
 uh
 government


agencies.


>> Uh
 how
 do
 you
 navigate
 that
 that
 kind
 of


situation?


>> The
 short
 answer
 is
 no.
 I
 don't
 think


this
 is
 a
 valid
 critique.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 great


example
 of
 what
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 at


the
 at
 the
 top,


>> which
 is
 a
 political
 argument


masquerading
 as
 an
 economic
 one.


>> When
 people
 say,
 "We
 don't
 trust
 the


data,"
 what
 they're
 really
 saying
 is,


"Well,
 we
 we
 don't
 really
 like
 the


Communist
 Party.
 We
 don't
 trust
 it.
 So


therefore,
 anything
 anything
 that
 it


says,
 including
 its
 statistics,


>> we
 we
 disbelieve."
 Right.


>> Yeah.
 So


I
 think
 the


one
 way
 to
 think
 about
 this
 is


China
 is
 a
 globally
 integrated
 economy,


right?
 They're
 the
 biggest
 exporter
 in


the
 world.
 I
 think
 they're
 still
 number


two
 in
 imports
 behind
 the
 United
 States.


Um
 they
 have
 huge
 investments
 globally.


Um


the
 trade
 data
 actually
 there's
 a


technical
 thing
 in
 the
 balance
 of


payments
 now
 which
 is
 a
 big
 focus
 of


controversy
 but
 in
 fact
 the


discrepancies
 in
 the
 trade
 data
 are
 are


pretty
 minor
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 basically


pretty
 easy
 to
 explain
 um
 and
 you
 know


so
 the
 the
 reality
 is
 that
 the
 trade


data
 is
 one
 of
 the
 ways
 that
 you
 can


validate


>> what's
 going
 on
 in
 China
 right
 yeah
 you


know
 if
 the
 economy
 really
 so
 small,
 how


can
 they
 import
 so
 much
 oil?


>> Yeah.


>> For
 example,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> Um


>> and
 there
 are
 things
 that
 you
 can


measure
 physically
 like
 output
 of


electricity
 and
 so
 forth
 which
 just
 that


that
 that
 is
 not
 fakeable,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> So
 the
 Soviet
 Union


basically
 had
 a
 madeup
 economy
 which
 was


largely
 aluric,
 right?
 They
 didn't
 trade


with
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world.
 They
 were


just
 within
 themselves.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 see
 in
 that
 kind
 of
 a
 situation
 you


can
 make
 up
 all
 kinds
 of
 numbers.


>> Yeah.


uh
 and
 they
 can
 seem
 to
 be
 true
 for
 a


while.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 then
 once
 you
 are
 exposed
 to
 the


rest
 of
 the
 world,
 they're
 revealed
 as


lies.
 Basically,
 that's
 essentially


>> uh
 and
 that
 would
 have
 been
 true,
 I


think,
 of
 China
 in
 the
 60s
 and
 70s.
 I


when
 they
 really
 were
 a
 closed
 off


economy,


>> it
 does,
 you
 know,
 if
 if
 China
 were


really
 making
 things
 up.
 Um
 my
 rule
 of


thumb
 is
 you
 know
 in
 a
 in
 an
 open
 system


and
 this
 would
 apply
 to
 a
 country
 making


up
 its
 stat
 statistics


um
 most
 people
 running
 sort
 of
 corporate


Ponzi
 scheme
 like


>> Enron


>> you
 you
 can
 probably
 do
 that
 for
 about


five
 years.


>> Yeah.


>> At
 scale
 and
 you
 cannot
 do
 it
 longer
 for


five
 years.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 can
 do
 it
 longer
 for
 than
 five
 years


if
 you're
 burning
 me
 off
 and
 you're
 just


like
 one
 guy
 with
 you
 know
 a
 handful
 of


investors.
 Um
 but
 at
 scale
 you
 can
 run
 a


a
 statistic
 scam
 of
 this
 type
 for
 a
 few


years.
 So
 if
 it
 hasn't
 been
 revealed
 as


you
 know
 if
 it
 hasn't
 collapsed
 in
 five


years
 what
 that
 tells
 you
 is
 whatever


the
 problems
 are
 these
 numbers
 are


broadly
 you
 know
 telling
 you
 the
 the


truth.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 you
 know
 and
 then
 you
 can
 get


into
 all
 kinds
 of
 technical
 discussions


about
 the
 GDP
 numbers
 and
 blah
 blah


blah.


>> Um
 but
 here's
 another
 way
 of
 thinking


about
 it.
 You
 know,
 so
 for
 a
 long
 time


there's
 been
 cottage
 industry
 people


saying,
 well,
 China's
 economic
 growth


rate
 for
 the
 last
 30
 years
 has
 not
 been


10%.
 It's
 really
 been
 7%.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 here
 are
 all
 these
 adjustments
 that


I
 do
 to
 prove
 that
 it's
 seven,
 not
 10.


>> But
 the
 reality
 is
 because
 it's
 an
 open


economy,
 you
 can
 say
 with
 high
 accuracy,


how
 big
 is
 the
 economy
 today?


>> Mhm.


>> Um
 and
 and
 you
 can
 look
 at
 the
 oil


import
 numbers
 and
 stuff
 like
 that
 and


and
 you
 know,
 calibrate
 that.
 And
 so
 if


for
 30
 years
 you
 your
 economy
 is
 X
 and


for
 the
 last
 30
 years
 your
 economy
 was


growing
 not
 by
 10
 but
 by
 seven.
 What


that
 means
 is
 that
 30
 years
 ago
 your


economy
 was
 twice
 as
 big.


>> Yeah.


>> As
 you
 thought
 it
 was
 then.
 How
 likely


is
 that?


>> Or
 conversely
 if
 we
 think
 that
 number


was
 correct
 and
 they
 were
 really
 growing


by
 seven,
 not
 10,
 then
 the
 economy
 is


only
 half
 as
 big
 as
 it
 appears
 to
 be


today.
 And
 how
 likely
 is
 that?
 Right?


>> Yeah.
 there's
 like
 an
 a
 very
 easy
 smell


test
 that
 you
 can
 do
 on
 these
 kinds
 of


exercises
 which
 you
 know
 exposes
 them.


So
 no
 I
 don't
 I
 just
 I
 refuse
 to
 take


that
 seriously.
 These
 are
 mostly
 people


who
 are
 discontented
 with
 the
 political


system,
 which
 I
 understand.


>> I
 agree.


>> Or
 or
 who
 extrapolate
 actual
 real
 data


problems
 which
 are
 significant.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 which
 require
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 to


untangle


>> and
 say,
 "Oh,
 well,
 because
 we
 can't


believe
 this
 thing.
 Therefore,
 we
 can't


believe
 anything.
 Therefore,
 we
 can
 make


up
 our
 own
 numbers
 about
 what
 we
 think


reality
 is."
 I
 just
 don't
 find
 that
 at


all
 a
 a
 a
 credible
 form
 of


argumentation.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 very
 good


explanation.
 I
 agree
 with
 you
 on
 most


points.
 Um
 the
 next
 question
 is
 actually


you
 know
 uh
 the
 since
 uh
 President
 Xi


came
 into
 power
 he's
 definitely


tightening
 the
 control
 on
 the
 whole


society
 right
 you
 see
 more
 civilians
 you


you
 see
 more
 big
 data
 control
 and
 like
 a


lot
 of
 dollar
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 is
 budget


uh
 spend
 on
 like
 really
 keep
 the
 society


stable.
 They
 call
 it
 like
 the
 cost
 of
 um


>> way
 like
 it's
 in
 Chinese
 right


>> um
 how
 sustainable
 that
 would
 be
 because


that
 cost
 is
 kind
 of
 increasing
 as
 you


know
 the
 economy
 is
 not
 doing
 well


people
 have
 u
 opinions
 and
 they
 are


discontent
 with
 the
 current
 political


system
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 spend
 more


and
 more
 money
 on
 doing
 that
 and
 uh
 you


know


>> yeah
 that's
 that
 that
 is
 I
 think
 there


are
 a
 lot
 of
 interesting


points
 that
 are
 raised
 by
 that
 question.


Mhm.


>> So
 um


one
 answer
 is
 that
 over
 a
 long
 period
 of


time
 the
 party
 and
 the
 government
 in


China
 have
 done
 a
 very
 good
 job
 of


basically
 making
 sure
 that
 living


standards
 rose
 for
 most
 people
 with
 most


>> uh
 and
 they
 did
 a
 very
 good
 job
 of


pushing
 resources
 from
 rich
 areas
 to


poor
 areas
 so
 that
 no
 area
 got
 too
 far


left
 behind.
 And
 there's
 still
 a
 lot
 of


inequality
 and
 so
 forth
 in
 China.
 It's


not
 by
 any
 means
 a
 perfect
 system,
 but


they
 did
 okay.
 And
 I
 think
 basically


sold
 people
 on
 the
 idea
 that


um


if
 you
 stick
 with
 us,
 you
 will
 do
 okay.


>> And
 uh
 we
 just
 ask
 you
 to
 like
 silence


your
 political
 views.


>> Exactly.


>> But
 we
 we
 guarantee
 that
 you'll
 be
 okay.


and
 that
 largely
 worked.
 Um


what's
 interesting
 and
 if
 there's
 very


good
 survey
 data
 from
 the
 like
 2010
 2012


showing
 that
 when
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of


discussion
 about
 social
 discontent
 in


China
 that
 actually
 people
 were
 not
 that


discontented.
 Uh
 people
 said
 well
 if
 I


got
 if
 people
 get
 rich
 it's
 because


they're
 smart
 and
 hardworking
 and
 if


you're
 poor
 it's
 because
 you're
 lazy
 and


>> uh
 system
 is
 not
 rigged.
 Um
 and
 the
 the


survey
 data
 also
 very
 clearly
 showed


that
 that
 um
 people
 have
 a
 lot
 of


complaints
 about
 their
 local
 officials


that
 they
 see


>> and
 they
 tend
 to
 have
 a
 much
 higher


opinion
 of
 the
 central
 leadership.
 So
 in


other
 words,
 they're
 not


um
 in
 general
 people
 are
 not
 saying
 the


system
 is
 rotten
 and
 corrupt.
 They're


saying
 my
 local
 officials
 are
 rotten
 and


corrupt.
 Ah


>> um
 and


that's
 the
 issue
 not
 some
 kind
 of
 more


systemic
 thing.
 Now
 what's
 interesting


is
 that
 some
 of
 the
 survey
 work
 has
 been


redone
 recently
 and
 it
 came
 to
 a
 more
 a


darker
 conclusion


>> which
 is
 that
 after
 10
 years
 of


Xiinping's
 anti-corruption
 campaigns


people
 are
 much
 more
 likely


to
 say
 if
 you're
 successful
 it's
 because


you
 were
 corrupt


>> 10
 years
 ago.


>> Interesting.


>> That
 is
 interesting.
 And
 I
 I
 I
 you
 can


only
 speculate
 as
 to
 why
 this
 is
 so.
 Um


>> yeah,


>> I
 I
 two
 ideas
 come
 to
 mind.
 One
 is
 just


like
 you
 know
 the
 economy
 is
 growing
 a


lot
 slower
 than
 it
 was
 and
 people
 see


less
 opportunity
 and
 if
 people
 see
 less


opportunity
 then
 they're
 more
 look
 more


willing
 to
 look
 for
 scapegoats.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 part
 of
 it.
 Uh
 the


other
 possible
 part
 of
 it
 is
 because


Xinping
 has
 spent
 so
 much
 time


trumpeting
 corruption
 that
 people
 have


been
 just
 internalized
 more
 of
 a
 sense


about
 oh
 wow
 I
 didn't
 realize
 that
 the


system
 was
 that


>> so
 corrupt.
 Yeah.


>> Um
 so
 it
 kind
 of
 the
 anti-corruption
 in


that
 sense
 sort
 of
 backfired.


>> Yeah.


>> Um


so
 yeah
 and
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at
 what
 they


spend
 on
 domestic
 security
 and
 so
 forth


it
 is
 it
 is
 massive.
 Mhm.


>> And
 so
 that
 is
 a
 cost.


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 crippling
 yet


>> for
 a
 couple
 reasons.
 One
 is
 again
 for


most
 people
 in
 most
 of
 urban
 China,
 life


is
 pretty
 good
 and
 your
 material


circumstances
 are
 reasonably
 well
 taken


care
 of
 and
 there's
 a
 sense
 of
 security


and
 stability
 that
 is,
 you
 know,
 broadly


shared.


>> Um,
 you
 know,
 and
 that
 could
 change,
 but


right
 right
 now,


>> I
 think
 that's
 most
 people's
 experience.


So
 there's
 a
 a
 degree
 of
 tolerance
 that


people
 give
 to
 the
 system
 because
 you


know
 things
 are
 kind
 of
 okay.
 Um
 and
 um


and
 you
 know
 then
 the
 other
 thing
 is


like


>> the


I
 hate
 to
 blame
 things
 on
 sort
 of


entertainment
 culture
 but
 um


>> the
 reality
 is
 China
 has
 a
 very
 rich


entertainment
 culture
 that
 is
 cost


right.
 Yeah.
 And
 you
 know,
 and
 people


talk
 about,
 oh,
 there's
 the
 great


firewall
 and
 you
 can't
 get
 foreign


websites
 and
 no
 one
 in
 China
 cares
 about


that.


>> Yeah.


>> They
 have
 a
 tremendous
 domestic
 internet


that
 they
 can,
 you
 know,
 play
 on
 all


day.


>> Oh,
 yeah.


>> There's
 uh
 huge,
 you
 know,
 sort
 of


gaming,
 short
 video,
 whole
 ecosystem,


social
 media,
 very
 vibrant.
 So,
 people


can
 live
 pretty
 active
 lives
 in
 that


sense.


>> Yeah.
 where
 they're
 not
 super


constrained
 unless
 they
 get
 into,
 you


know,
 very
 targeted
 political.


>> I
 agree.
 Yeah.


>> Um
 so
 I
 I
 tend
 to
 think
 that
 all
 of


these
 things
 mean
 that


um
 look,
 this
 is
 not
 the
 system
 that
 I


would
 choose
 to
 live
 under.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 too
 constraining
 and


and and
 whatnot,
 but
 I
 I
 think
 it
 is
 a


system
 that
 that
 continues
 to
 work
 well


enough


at
 acceptable
 cost
 for
 the
 regime.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 you
 can
 critique
 it
 in
 any
 number
 of


ways,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 it's
 likely


to


fall
 apart
 or
 or
 create
 some
 kind
 of


unbearable
 cost


>> in
 the
 next
 several
 years.


>> Yeah.
 The
 next
 uh
 next
 question
 is
 very


interesting.
 I
 think
 um
 basically
 the


listener
 is
 arguing
 like
 trying
 to
 push


back
 against
 all
 the
 pessimism
 from
 uh


professor
 Shu
 or
 uh
 Chinuay.
 Uh
 he


basically
 said
 that
 you
 know
 uh
 China


has
 such
 a
 low
 cost
 of
 living.
 You
 have


we
 have
 like
 really
 cheap
 utilities
 uh


great
 transportation
 really
 low
 cost.


Education
 is
 really
 cheap.
 Like
 I
 I
 did


my
 um
 high
 school
 like
 college
 education


in
 China
 and
 the
 cost
 is
 not
 that
 great.


It's
 not
 a
 heavy
 burden
 for
 my
 parents


like
 to
 kind
 of
 support
 us
 through
 that.


US
 is
 completely
 different
 story.
 I


think
 in
 all
 the
 western
 developed


countries
 those
 private
 schools
 are


super
 expensive.


>> But
 like
 they
 argue
 that
 that's
 kind
 of


the
 hidden
 welfare
 the
 Chinese
 people


are
 enjoying
 comparing
 to
 those
 wealthy


nation
 like
 US
 which
 is
 not
 direct
 cash


handle
 but
 it's
 like
 you
 know
 it's
 it's


benefit
 you
 kind
 of
 get.
 So
 that's
 the


reason
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 in
 China
 are


still
 happy
 with
 where
 they
 are,
 even


though
 not
 as
 happy
 as
 they
 could
 be,


but
 like
 they're
 still
 comfortable


living
 there.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that's
 true.
 Um
 I
 I
 kind


of
 made
 that
 point
 earlier
 when
 I
 was


talking
 about
 the,
 you
 know,
 the
 social


welfare
 system.
 Um
 that
 in
 formal
 terms,


if
 you
 measure
 what
 do
 they
 pay
 out
 in


pensions
 and


>> social
 insurance
 and
 so
 forth,
 it's
 it's


not
 that
 great.
 But
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


kind
 of
 what
 you
 could
 call
 the
 implicit


social
 welfare
 system,
 there
 are
 a
 lot


of
 elements
 into
 it
 and
 and
 this
 sort
 of


low
 cost
 of
 living
 is
 one
 and
 I
 think


you
 know
 if
 you
 if
 you
 look
 at


Xiinping's
 rhetoric
 over
 the
 last


several
 years
 when
 people
 talk
 about
 you


know
 deflation
 and
 so
 forth
 I
 think
 it's


pretty
 clear
 that
 this
 is
 how
 he
 he


views


>> uh
 that
 oh
 what's
 wrong
 with
 deflation?


It
 means
 lower
 prices
 everyone
 is
 better


off.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 and
 so
 forth.
 So
 I
 think
 there
 is


there
 is
 some
 you
 know
 and
 it
 is
 it
 is


true
 that
 you
 know
 you
 look
 at
 the


United
 States
 what's
 the
 big
 political


issue
 at
 the
 moment
 it's
 affordability.


>> Yeah.
 Exactly.


>> Right.
 Because
 housing
 costs
 too
 much


and
 there
 are
 all
 these
 other
 costs
 that


are
 too
 much
 and
 it's
 a
 real
 problem.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 and
 I
 think
 the
 the
 sort
 of
 the


flip
 side
 of
 that
 is
 um
 yes
 that
 China


has
 um


uh
 one
 of
 the
 ways
 that
 they
 are
 able
 to


engineer
 this
 sort
 of
 tolerance


uh
 among
 citizenry
 is
 that
 life
 just
 you


can
 live
 an
 okay
 life
 for
 that
 not
 that


much
 money.
 Mhm.


>> And
 so
 that
 kind
 of
 reduces
 your


expectations
 of
 how
 much
 money
 you
 need


to
 make
 now
 or
 how
 much
 you
 need
 to
 make


in
 future
 in
 order
 to
 be
 okay.


>> Mhm.


>> So
 I
 think
 I
 think
 that
 is
 part
 of
 the


if
 you
 will
 consent
 mechanism
 they've


created.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 uh
 next
 question
 he
 asked
 about
 is
 uh


kind
 of
 from
 the
 the
 global
 south


strategy.
 So
 he
 say
 like
 oh
 yeah
 we


China
 company
 has
 this
 overap
 capacity


instead
 of
 fighting
 with
 all
 the
 hostile


western
 markets
 can
 we
 just
 simply
 pivot


to
 invest
 in
 the
 global
 south
 like


working
 with
 um
 Africa
 working
 with
 like


uh
 Asian
 other
 Asian
 countries
 and
 to


create
 new
 demand.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 yes
 and
 no.
 Uh
 I
 mean
 I
 think


the
 reality
 is
 um


that
 you
 know
 the
 US
 and
 Europe
 the
 rich


countries
 are
 still
 the
 best
 markets.


>> Exactly.


>> If
 you
 if
 you
 if
 you
 talk
 to
 any
 of


these
 big
 Chinese
 tech
 companies
 like


BYD
 or
 Cat


>> Yeah.


>> they
 are
 desperate
 to
 get
 it
 to
 the
 US


market.
 They
 would
 love
 that
 so
 much


because
 they're
 huge
 markets.
 You
 can


you
 can
 charge
 higher
 prices.
 Um
 so
 yeah


you
 can
 get
 by
 you
 know
 diversifying


into
 lower
 income
 markets
 but
 that
 is


>> clearly
 a
 suboptimal
 strategy.


>> I
 agree


>> for
 most
 of
 these
 countries
 companies.


So
 um
 you
 know
 the
 the
 more
 ideal


situation
 from
 Chinese
 corporate


perspective
 is
 that
 they
 could
 work
 out


some
 arrangement
 whereby


um
 uh
 you
 know
 they
 could
 gain
 more


access
 and
 and
 let's
 be
 real
 about
 this.


this.
 I
 mean,
 if
 you
 divide
 the
 world


into
 the
 OECD,


>> the
 Organization
 of
 Economic
 Partition


Development
 Countries,
 this
 is
 about
 30


rich
 democracies
 basically.


>> They
 still
 account
 for
 60
 plus%
 of
 the


global
 economy.
 And
 that's
 down
 from


what
 it
 was
 30
 years
 ago,
 but
 that's


still
 twothirds
 of
 the
 global
 economy.


>> Um,
 and
 that
 shares
 is
 falling,
 but
 it's


falling
 very
 slowly.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 I
 think
 it
 is
 much
 more


rational
 for
 China
 to
 have
 a
 sort
 of
 all


the
 world
 strategy
 on
 this
 and
 it
 it's
 a


little
 bit
 uh
 wishful
 thinking
 to
 think


that
 if
 you
 are
 completely
 shut
 out
 of


the
 markets
 of
 of
 the
 US
 and
 Europe
 that


you
 can
 totally
 make
 this
 upside
 now
 the


reality
 is
 that
 you're
 not
 totally
 shut


out
 of
 of
 US
 and
 European
 markets


particularly
 in
 Europe.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 even
 in
 the
 US
 you
 know
 the
 Chinese


companies
 can't
 sell
 cars
 but
 consumer


electronics
 they're
 selling
 a
 ton.
 Oh


yeah,
 I
 agree.
 Yeah.


>> Uh
 so
 the
 reality
 is
 that
 China


continues
 both
 directly
 and
 indirectly


to
 be
 heavily
 heavily
 reliant
 on
 the
 US


and
 the
 other
 developed
 markets
 and


that's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 case
 for
 some


time
 to
 time.


>> Yeah.


So
 the
 next
 question
 from
 the
 listener


is
 uh
 he
 he
 he's
 asking
 about
 like
 a


philosophical
 question
 about
 the
 strong


nation,
 right?
 So
 I
 think
 we
 we
 can
 all


agree
 like
 China


>> as
 a
 state
 power
 is
 like
 number
 two
 or


like
 I
 mean
 like
 President
 Trump
 is


talking
 about
 G2,
 right?
 I
 think
 he's


he's
 a
 very
 pragmatic
 and
 re
 realist
 u


>> the
 geopolitics
 um
 area.
 So
 I
 I
 wouldn't


argue
 against
 that.
 But
 like
 from
 the


individual
 average
 citizen
 living


standard,
 China
 is
 still
 uh
 pretty
 much


behind
 of
 all
 the
 leading
 western


countries,
 right?
 So
 um
 his
 question
 is


like
 does
 US
 and
 China
 simply
 have


fundamentally
 different
 definition
 of


what
 constitute
 a
 strong
 nation?
 Like
 US


is
 really
 focused
 on
 individual
 but


China
 is
 like
 we
 we
 are
 just
 looking
 at


the
 grand
 country
 we're
 strong
 that's
 it


we
 don't
 really
 need
 to
 push
 for
 that
 uh


individual
 improvement.


>> Um
 yeah
 I
 think
 that's
 to
 some
 degree
 a


fair
 point.
 You
 know
 it's
 maybe
 less


true
 than
 it
 was
 a
 year
 ago.
 I
 mean
 with


Trump
 now
 um
 it
 seems
 pretty
 clear
 the


position
 of
 the
 US
 government
 is
 that
 we


really
 don't
 care
 that
 much
 about


individual
 welfare
 and
 about
 these
 kind


of
 tokens
 of
 state
 state
 power.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 like
 the
 funny
 there's
 a


funny
 joke
 uh
 everybody
 expect
 China
 to


behave
 more
 like
 US
 but
 now
 US
 is


behaving
 more
 like
 China.


>> Yes,
 that's
 right.
 They're
 kind
 of
 a
 bad


copy
 of
 China
 taking
 all
 the
 worst


aspects
 and
 none
 of
 the
 good
 stuff.
 Mhm.


>> Um
 so
 yeah
 and
 I
 think
 what
 that
 reveals


is
 that
 okay
 so
 the
 US
 has
 always
 had


sort
 of
 this
 ideology
 of
 you
 know


individualism
 and
 and
 so
 forth
 and
 and


and
 the
 economy
 has
 been
 run
 you
 know
 at


least
 since
 World
 War
 II


>> uh
 with
 a
 pretty
 strong
 bias
 in
 favor
 of


consumer
 welfare.
 Mhm.


>> Um


but
 you
 know
 the
 US
 has
 also
 been
 a
 a


big
 global
 power
 for
 a
 long
 time.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 you
 know
 pretty
 imperialist.
 Um
 and


the
 imperialism
 takes
 you
 know
 different


guises.
 Right
 now
 it's
 basically
 naked.


Um


>> uh
 but
 you
 know
 even
 when
 it
 wasn't


naked
 it
 was
 still
 there
 right?
 So
 um
 I


think
 the
 US
 leadership
 has
 has
 for
 a


very
 long
 time
 taken
 quite
 seriously
 you


know
 concepts
 of
 what
 you
 need
 to
 do
 to


um
 promote
 what
 the
 Chinese
 would
 call


comprehensive
 national
 power.


>> Um
 and
 I
 think
 I
 guess
 if
 I
 had
 to


analyze
 I
 would
 say
 look
 if
 you
 look
 in


the
 cold
 war
 there
 was
 a
 clear
 sort
 of


US
 versus
 Soviet
 Union
 rivalry.
 Um


there
 were
 a
 lot
 of
 national
 projects
 in


the
 United
 States
 in
 the
 50s
 and
 60s


particularly


>> which
 were
 driven
 by
 this
 sense
 of
 great


power
 competition
 and
 there
 were
 things


that
 we
 had
 to
 do
 as
 a
 nation


>> that
 didn't
 have
 anything
 to
 do
 with


consumer
 welfare
 but
 were
 important
 for


for
 national
 you
 know
 power
 right


>> you
 know
 and
 I
 think
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


cold
 war
 basically
 from
 the
 90s
 onwards


the
 US
 said
 well
 we
 don't
 really
 have
 to


do
 that
 anymore
 because
 we're
 the
 sole


remaining
 superpower
 and
 so
 we
 don't


need
 these
 national
 projects.
 We
 can


just,
 you
 know,
 do
 m
 individualized


wealth
 maximization
 basically
 and
 that's


fine.
 And
 then
 you
 add
 all
 that
 up
 and


we're
 great.


>> Um
 and
 in
 some
 sense
 they
 were
 I
 mean
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 US
 economic
 performance


since
 the
 financial
 crisis
 of
 2008
 it
 is


the
 best
 of
 any
 country
 in
 the
 world.


>> Yeah.


>> Basically
 better
 than
 any
 developed


country.
 And
 you
 know
 for
 the
 last
 five


years
 as
 I
 said
 it's
 actually
 been


growing
 faster
 terms
 than
 China.
 So


>> yeah,


>> there
 is
 a
 way
 in
 which
 that
 works.


>> Um


um
 but
 it's
 also,
 you
 know,
 would
 you


say
 that
 the
 US
 has
 been
 run
 totally


with
 an
 idea
 to
 making
 the
 individual's


life
 as
 good
 as
 it
 possibly
 can
 be?


Well,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 in
 the
 US
 would


dispute
 that.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 know,
 all
 these
 questions
 about
 in


affordability.
 Uh
 you
 know,
 there's
 huge


social
 fractures
 that
 are
 showing
 up
 in


the
 the
 political
 system.
 there
 are
 a


lot
 of
 people
 in
 the
 in
 the
 country
 who


feel
 that
 they've
 gotten
 a
 raw
 deal.
 Um


so
 it's
 mixed,
 right?
 It's
 mixed
 in
 the


US.
 Um
 and
 I
 I
 think
 the
 difference
 is


that
 that
 China
 has
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 more


unified
 political
 system.
 It
 is


authoritarian.
 So
 there
 is
 kind
 of
 an


authoritative
 view
 that
 comes
 out
 at
 the


top.


>> Uh
 it
 is,
 you
 know,
 basically
 a
 Leninist


political
 structures
 are
 highly


centralized.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 and
 um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 yes


there
 is
 this
 kind
 of
 vision
 of
 national


power
 um
 that
 gets
 articulated
 which
 is


divorced
 from
 most
 concepts
 of
 like


consumer
 welfare


>> but
 I
 I
 would
 say
 it's
 it's
 also
 balance


right
 so
 I
 think
 the
 reason
 that
 China


has
 been
 so
 successful
 for
 so
 long
 is


like
 they've
 been
 pursuing
 national


power
 in
 this
 overall
 way
 but
 they've


recognized
 for
 in
 order
 for
 that
 to
 be


sustainable


most
 people
 in
 China
 have
 to
 get
 enough


out
 of
 it


>> for
 them
 to
 keep
 playing
 the
 game.
 So


there
 has
 been
 this
 sense
 that
 there
 has


to
 be
 broad
 shared
 prosperity
 and
 growth


in
 China
 that
 that
 goes
 down
 to
 the
 to


the
 household
 level.
 Um
 so
 the
 the
 kind


of
 Leninist


um
 comprehensive
 national
 power
 uh


aspiration
 has
 always
 been
 I
 think


tempered
 over
 the
 last
 few
 decades


>> by
 this
 knowledge
 that


>> if
 we
 do
 it
 the
 way
 the
 Soviet
 Union


did,
 we
 will
 end
 up
 the
 way
 the
 Soviet


Union
 did.


>> And
 what
 the
 Soviet
 Union
 did
 is
 that
 it


did
 not
 pay
 enough
 attention
 to
 the


quality
 of
 life
 for
 the
 average
 citizen.


um
 and
 to
 sort
 of
 economic
 opportunity


and
 I
 think
 that
 lesson
 is
 still
 very


very
 uh
 deeply
 entrenched
 in
 the
 Chinese


leadership
 however
 much
 they've
 become


more
 focused
 on
 these
 great
 power


competition
 issues.


>> Yeah.
 Do
 you
 think
 China
 can
 transition


into
 a
 model
 that
 Singapore
 has
 done?


you
 know
 like
 Singapore
 is
 not
 really
 we


we
 from
 our
 American
 terms
 it's
 not


really
 a
 democratic
 country
 right
 like


it
 has
 a
 very
 strong
 party
 kind
 of


ruling
 and
 uh


>> it
 has
 it
 has
 a
 decent
 social
 uh
 welfare


program
 it
 also


>> uh
 pretty
 cracking
 down
 on
 people
 have


descent
 or
 criticize
 the
 government
 but


even
 though
 like
 the
 government
 has
 a


pretty
 good
 reputation
 of
 improving
 the


welfare
 like
 but
 they
 have
 a
 very
 good


judicial
 system
 I
 think
 like
 they
 call


it
 far,
 right?
 Like
 they
 basically
 rule


by
 law,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> Uh


>> I
 I
 would
 argue
 I
 think
 rule
 by
 law
 is


more
 important
 than
 democracy
 like
 just


like
 voting
 everybody
 has
 a
 one
 vote


like
 typically
 you
 will
 have
 uh
 majority


uh
 tyranny
 or
 like
 there's
 other
 terms


talking
 about
 that
 like
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 ideal
 system.
 You
 will
 have
 more


uh
 populist
 government
 coming
 out
 of


that.
 I
 think
 like
 do
 you
 think
 China


has
 a
 potential
 to
 kind
 of
 transition
 to


the
 Singapore
 model
 be
 more
 judicious


like
 rule
 by
 law
 focus
 on
 that
 instead


of
 like
 you
 know
 getting
 you
 into
 a


populist
 uh
 democracy.


>> Yeah.
 Well
 I
 have
 a
 I
 have
 a
 couple


response
 to
 that.
 So
 first
 of
 all
 as
 a


you
 know
 American
 I
 will
 disagree
 with


you
 on
 that
 last
 point.
 I
 I
 think


democracy
 is
 a
 very
 good
 thing.
 It


doesn't
 guarantee
 good
 governance.


>> Um,
 but
 it
 gives
 you,
 I
 think,
 a
 better


shot
 at
 sustaining
 good
 governance
 over


a
 long
 period
 of
 time.


>> I
 agree,


>> most
 other
 systems.
 And
 the
 other
 thing


is
 that
 I
 think
 people
 get
 a
 little
 bit


too
 hung
 up
 on
 the
 on
 the
 on
 the
 sort
 of


rule
 rule
 by
 law,
 rule
 of
 law
 thing.


>> Uh
 there's
 no
 question
 in
 my
 mind
 that


the
 US
 as
 a
 dance
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 over


lawyered.
 So
 we
 can
 do
 with
 a
 little


less
 of
 that.
 Um


uh
 but
 also
 you
 know
 what
 what
 it
 really


boils
 down
 to
 is
 can
 you
 can
 you
 sustain


good
 governance


>> right
 and
 um
 you
 know
 having
 a
 good


legal
 system
 with
 various
 kinds
 of


checks
 on
 on
 power
 I
 think
 it's
 really


important
 to
 do
 that
 and
 it's
 very
 it's


very
 difficult
 to
 achieve
 that
 in
 any


kind
 of
 non-democratic
 system.
 So
 I


would
 still,
 you
 know,
 personally
 I


would
 just
 say
 um
 over
 the
 long
 run
 um


uh
 in
 an
 advanced
 economy
 um
 you
 know


you're
 you're
 better
 off
 with
 democracy


than
 with
 some
 other
 system.
 I
 mean
 what


happens
 when
 Xiinping
 dies,
 right?


>> We
 we
 have
 no
 idea
 what
 is
 going
 to


happen.
 Yeah.


>> To
 the
 the
 Chinese
 political
 system


after
 that.
 And
 you
 can
 imagine
 many


many
 different
 outcomes,
 right?
 So


clearly
 I
 mean
 clearly
 democracy
 allow


the
 US
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 problems
 and
 we
 are


seeing
 them
 full
 full
 on
 right
 now.
 So
 I


don't
 want to
 sugarcoat
 it


>> but
 just
 it's
 like
 on
 average
 over
 time


which
 would
 you'd
 rather
 have
 I
 think


that's
 that


>> um
 I
 I
 would
 still
 go
 for
 that
 in
 terms


of
 but
 that
 said
 you
 know
 I
 think


authoritarian
 systems
 also
 have
 a
 wide


range.
 Some
 are
 very
 effective
 do


provide
 good
 governance
 over
 a
 long


period
 of
 time.
 China
 is
 a
 good
 example


of
 that.
 Mhm.


>> Um,
 and
 I
 think
 Singapore,
 you're
 right,


is
 is
 sort
 of
 the
 ultimate
 example
 of
 a


non-democratic
 authoritarian
 system
 that


has
 provided
 very
 consistent


constrained
 good
 governance
 for
 a
 very


very
 long
 time.
 So
 they
 they
 have
 a


successful
 model.
 Um,
 I
 will
 I
 will
 end


with
 a
 apocryphal
 anecdote
 that
 gives


gives
 you
 my
 view
 on
 on
 whether
 they


>> China
 could
 become
 like
 Singapore.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 remember
 who
 told
 me
 the


story
 and
 I'm
 sure
 it's
 not
 true
 but


it's
 yeah
 it's
 too
 good
 not
 to
 use.


>> So
 the
 story
 is
 that
 Lee
 Guuan
 Yu
 the


prime
 minister
 of
 Singapore
 back
 in
 the


80s


>> came
 up
 to
 Beijing
 and
 had
 a
 meeting


with
 Doug
 Jing.


>> Uhhuh.


>> And
 Lieuan
 Yu
 as
 was
 his
 want
 like


talked
 endlessly
 about
 how
 great
 he
 was


and
 how
 Singapore
 was
 now,
 how
 China


should
 do
 this
 and
 China
 should
 do
 that.


And
 Dung
 just
 sort
 of
 sat
 there
 very


quietly
 every
 so
 often
 would
 spit
 into


his
 spatoon.
 And
 then
 finally
 after
 Lee


Kuanu
 had
 sat
 down
 and
 you
 know


exhausted
 himself
 dung
 le
 forward
 and


said
 Mr.
 Lee
 that
 was
 very
 interesting


and
 should
 I
 ever
 become
 the
 mayor
 of


the
 city
 I
 will
 be
 sure
 to
 follow
 your


advice.


So
 the
 point
 of
 it
 being
 what
 you
 can
 do


in
 Singapore
 because
 it
 is
 a
 city
 state


>> has
 basically
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 what
 is


achievable
 on
 a
 full-scale
 country
 let


alone
 a
 full-scale
 country
 on
 the
 scale


of
 China
 which
 is
 just
 gigantic
 both
 in


terms
 of
 population
 geography


>> social
 complexity
 etc.
 So
 no
 that
 I


think
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 a
 clean
 Singapore


option
 is
 not
 available
 for
 China.
 It
 is


always
 going
 to
 be
 a
 way
 more


complicated


and
 fractious


um
 uh
 you
 know
 governance
 challenge.
 And


if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 reality
 of
 China


today
 I
 think
 that's
 still
 true.
 He's


still
 you
 know
 Xinping
 has
 a
 lot
 more


authority
 than
 past
 leaders.
 It's
 very


centralized,
 but
 there's
 still
 a
 lot


going
 on
 at
 the
 local
 level
 that
 the


center


>> is
 not
 really
 able
 to
 control
 all
 that


well.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 whatever
 China's
 political
 evolution


is
 going
 to
 be,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 its
 own


thing.
 It's
 not
 going
 to
 be,


>> I
 think,
 all
 that
 close
 either
 to
 the


Singapore
 model
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 or
 the


US
 model
 on
 the
 other
 hand.
 Got
 to


figure
 some
 other
 some
 other
 path.
 Yeah,


I
 I
 think
 I
 really
 like
 your
 story
 and
 I


I
 remember
 reading
 a
 article
 basically


the
 scholar
 argued
 that
 democracy
 is
 a


luxury
 like
 when
 you
 average
 GDP
 reach
 a


certain
 level
 above
 that
 level
 it's


easier
 for
 it's
 more
 likely
 you're
 going


to
 keep
 that
 democracy
 otherwise
 you're


going
 to
 see
 that
 democracy
 kind
 of


turned
 into
 you
 know
 um
 authoritarian


regime
 and
 it's
 very
 easy
 for
 people
 to


hack
 hijack
 the
 system
 and
 change
 a


bunch
 of
 the
 rules
 and
 uh
 change
 the


constitution
 and
 now
 you're
 seeing
 that


happens
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 democratic
 country


or
 formerly
 viewed
 as
 democratic
 country


right
 for
 example
 Venezuela
 is
 one


example
 like
 it
 used
 to
 have
 a
 very
 um


how
 to
 say
 broad
 like
 participated


democratic
 system
 but
 when
 Chavis
 win


the
 election
 and
 he
 just
 like
 changed


the
 constitution
 and
 he
 he
 basically


slowly
 but
 surely
 destroyed
 the
 the


system.
 Uh
 I
 really
 appreciate
 your
 time


and
 uh
 today's
 conversation
 is
 really


good.
 I
 I
 really
 appreciate
 your
 time


and
 participation
 and
 hope
 you
 uh
 doing


well
 in
 your
 future
 endeavors.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 thank
 you
 very
 much.
 I


thought
 it
 was
 a
 great
 conversation.
 Uh


very
 well
 structured.
 I
 I
 enjoyed
 uh
 all


the
 questions
 and
 I
 enjoyed
 being
 able


to
 uh
 engage
 even
 vicariously
 with


Chinhai
 and
 Shujang.
 You
 know,
 a
 lot
 of


very
 interesting
 food
 there.


>> Yeah,
 really.
 Thank
 you.
 Yeah.


>> Okay.
 Thanks
 so
 much.


>> Thank
 you.
 Bye.


>> Okay.
 Right.
 Bye.
 Bye.
