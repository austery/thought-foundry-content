Hello
 my
 friends.
 Today
 is
 February
 7th


and
 this
 is
 Markets
 Weekly.
 So
 this
 past


week
 was
 a
 volatile
 week
 in
 markets.
 The


week
 before
 we
 had
 volatility
 in
 the


precious
 metals.
 This
 week
 it
 was
 in
 the


major
 indexes.
 Looking
 at
 the
 S&P
 500,


we
 briefly
 broke
 below
 the
 100-day


moving
 average.
 However,
 we
 did
 have
 a


monster
 rally
 on
 Friday
 and
 that
 took
 us


right
 back
 above
 the
 50-day
 moving


average,
 which
 many
 market
 participants


perceive
 to
 be
 indicative
 of
 an
 ongoing


uptrend.
 However,
 zooming
 out,
 when
 I


look
 at
 this,
 it
 seems
 really
 obvious


that
 we've
 gone
 nowhere
 for
 months
 and


continue
 to
 lose
 momentum.
 So,
 it
 does


not
 look
 good
 to
 me.
 So,
 today,
 let's


talk
 about
 three
 things.
 First
 off,
 we


have
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 labor
 market


where
 it
 seems
 like
 we're
 getting
 worse


labor
 market
 data,
 and
 that's
 uh


suggestive
 of
 more
 cuts
 than
 what's


currently
 priced
 into
 the
 market.


Secondly,
 let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about


the
 carnage
 in
 the
 stock
 market.
 It


seems
 to
 be
 largely
 driven
 by
 tech,
 in


part
 due
 to
 uh
 Amazon
 earnings,
 in
 part


due
 to
 a
 new
 AI
 model
 from
 Anthropic


that
 is
 challenging
 the
 business
 models


of
 software
 as
 a
 service
 companies.
 And


lastly,
 we
 have
 to
 talk
 a
 little
 bit


about
 crypto.
 We
 had
 tremendous


volatility
 in
 Bitcoin
 down
 to
 60,000,


but
 of
 course
 rebounded
 by
 $10,000
 on


Friday.
 It
 seems
 like
 we
 may
 be
 heading


into
 a
 crypto
 winter.
 All
 right,


starting
 with
 the
 labor
 market.


So
 last
 week
 we
 had
 Challenger
 report


something
 that
 was
 pretty
 surprising.
 So


Challenger
 is
 a
 private
 consulting


company
 that
 goes
 and
 pulls
 companies


about
 their
 intentions
 to
 hire
 or
 fire.


Now
 according
 to
 them,
 businesses
 have


significantly
 ramped
 up
 their
 intention


to
 lay
 off
 workers.
 In
 fact,
 the
 total


amount
 of
 announced
 layoffs
 could
 be
 as


high
 as
 it's
 been
 in
 many
 years.
 Now


that
 seems
 to
 be
 corroorated
 by
 official


data
 that
 was
 announced
 a
 few
 days


later.
 The
 Jolts
 report
 that
 shows
 that


job
 openings
 surprisingly
 decreased.
 Now


job
 openings
 uh
 for
 job
 openings
 per


worker
 looking
 for
 a
 job
 has
 now


declined
 to
 levels
 that
 are
 below


preandemic.
 So
 it's
 very
 clear
 that
 the


labor
 market
 continues
 to
 soften.
 Now


recall
 at
 the
 last
 Fed
 meeting,
 Governor


Waller
 dissented
 and
 wanted
 a
 25
 basis


point
 cut.
 The
 rationale
 he
 gave
 was


that
 he
 was
 hearing
 from
 his
 contacts


that
 everyone
 is
 thinking
 about
 uh


laying
 off
 workers
 and
 so
 there
 was


significant
 downside
 risk
 uh
 to
 the


labor
 market.
 Now
 we
 all
 thought
 it
 was


because
 he
 wanted
 to
 be
 fed
 share
 and


maybe
 that
 plays
 a
 role
 but
 it
 seemed


like
 his
 information
 was
 accurate.
 So


normally
 we
 would
 have
 gotten
 the


non-formance
 payrolls
 report
 on
 Friday


but
 because
 of
 a
 government
 shutdown


that's
 been
 propo
 postponed
 until


Wednesday.
 So
 uh
 at
 that
 time
 we'll
 get


the
 gold
 standard
 uh
 labor
 market
 report


but
 direction
 seems
 very
 clear.
 The


labor
 market
 is
 softening
 and
 if
 that's


the
 case
 that
 also
 suggests
 downside
 pre


risk
 to
 inflation.
 The
 US
 is
 largely
 a


servicesdriven
 economy.
 If
 you
 look
 at


the
 inflation
 indexes
 it's
 also
 largely


services
 driven
 as
 well.


If
 you
 have
 a
 weak
 labor
 market,
 then


wage
 growth
 will
 decelerate
 and
 that


suggests
 downward
 pressure
 on
 service


inflation,
 which
 of
 course
 implies


downward
 pressure
 on
 the
 broader


inflation
 indexes.
 Together,
 weaker


labor
 market,
 weaker
 inflation
 suggests


that
 we'll
 probably
 get
 more
 Fed
 cuts


than
 the
 two
 cuts
 priced
 into
 the


market.
 That
 will
 make
 chairwores
 drop
 a


lot
 easier.
 Okay.
 The
 second
 thing
 we


have
 to
 talk
 about,
 of
 course,
 is
 the


volatility
 and
 the
 equity
 markets.
 And


this
 was
 largely
 centered
 in
 tech.


So
 over
 the
 past
 few
 weeks
 we
 got
 the


max
 7
 techch
 earnings
 and
 you
 know


they've
 been
 announcing
 a
 lot
 of
 uh


capital
 expenditures
 into
 this
 has
 been


an
 ongoing
 thing.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 this


chart
 from
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 you


can
 see
 that
 collectively
 the
 max
 7


companies
 are
 are
 are
 investing
 hundreds


of
 billions
 in
 the
 AI
 buildup
 right


buying
 data
 centers
 GPU
 chips
 um
 power


plants
 and
 so
 forth.
 So
 it's
 been


something
 that
 uh
 the
 market
 is
 aware
 of


and
 in
 the
 past
 has
 rewarded
 uh
 seeing


that
 the
 companies
 are
 investing
 in
 AI.


I
 guess
 made
 investors
 think
 that
 they


are
 going
 to
 benefit
 from
 the
 AI


revolution.
 As
 an
 aside,
 President


Makong
 of
 France
 also
 announced
 that
 uh


he's
 going
 to
 doing
 some
 investments


into
 AI.
 He
 announced
 a
 30
 million


investment
 uh
 in
 AI
 researchers.
 Um


that
 uh
 is
 million
 not
 billion.
 Okay.
 In


any
 case,
 now
 the
 market
 has
 usually


rewarded
 the
 Max
 7
 companies
 for
 for


investing
 in
 AI,
 but
 this
 week
 though


there
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


change
 in
 tune.
 Now,
 when
 Amazon


announced
 that
 they
 would
 invest
 200


billion
 in
 AI
 this
 year,
 the
 the
 the


market
 punished
 them.
 So,
 their
 stock


was
 down
 10%
 after
 earnings.
 Now


sometimes
 they
 seem
 to
 have
 rewarded


Meta
 for
 example.
 But
 now
 it
 seems
 to
 be


a
 uh
 not


clearly
 good
 for
 their
 stock
 price.
 So


that
 could
 potentially
 mark
 a
 change
 in


tune
 in
 how
 the
 market
 is
 perceiving


this
 because
 obviously
 when
 a
 company
 is


spending
 so
 much
 money
 on
 AI
 uh
 there's


less
 cash
 available
 to
 return
 to


shareholders
 in
 the
 form
 of
 buybacks
 and


of
 course
 it
 is
 a
 huge
 bet.
 AI
 is


obviously
 really
 cool
 technology
 but
 it


may
 not
 be
 very
 profitable.
 It
 is


obviously
 a
 competitive
 competitive


industry.


I
 also
 note
 that
 at
 the
 announcement
 of


Amazon's
 huge
 capex
 expenditures,
 I


would
 have
 expected
 companies
 like


Nvidia
 and
 other
 chipmakers
 to
 benefit,


but
 they
 I
 didn't
 see
 that.
 So
 that
 was


interesting.
 Now
 the
 other
 thing
 in
 the


tech
 world
 of
 course
 was
 the


announcement
 of
 anthropic
 AI.
 It's
 new


cloud
 version
 which
 apparently
 can
 do
 uh


a
 lot
 of
 vibe
 coding
 really
 well
 that


allows
 people
 who
 are
 not
 trained


programmers
 to
 be
 able
 to
 vibe
 code


things
 really
 easily.
 Um
 basically


customized
 software
 that
 could


potentially
 replace
 software
 that
 their


companies
 currently
 use.
 Uh
 let's
 say


things
 like
 document
 review,
 back
 office


stuff,
 payroll
 accounting,
 maybe
 stuff


like
 that.
 So
 companies
 that
 currently


specialize
 in
 things
 like
 that
 like


Salesforce
 or
 Adobe
 uh
 they
 saw
 their


stock
 price
 decline
 pretty
 notably
 the


past
 week.
 The
 thinking
 is
 of
 course
 if


is
 that
 if
 a
 company
 can
 use
 an
 AI
 bot


to
 create
 customized
 vioded
 software
 to


suit
 their
 needs
 and
 protect
 their
 own


data
 at
 a
 very
 very
 low
 price
 why
 would


be
 they
 be
 using
 these
 software
 as
 a


service
 uh
 the
 services
 of
 these
 SAS


companies.
 And
 so
 that
 you
 know
 kind
 of


makes
 sense
 but
 then
 we
 also
 have
 to


keep
 in
 mind
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 um
 these


companies
 have
 long-standing


relationships
 with
 their
 services


providers
 and
 of
 course
 you
 have
 a
 lot


of
 employees
 who
 probably
 don't
 want
 to


change
 the
 way
 they
 currently
 do
 things.


So
 there
 is
 some
 stickiness
 there
 but
 in


any
 case
 the
 market
 was
 a
 little
 bit


panic.
 Now
 this
 also
 bled
 into
 the


credit
 markets
 as
 well.
 So
 uh
 over
 the


past
 few
 years
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 private


credit
 companies
 have
 been
 lending
 to


software
 companies
 in
 a
 big
 way.
 Now,


Aries
 Capital
 Corporation,
 which
 manages


the
 largest
 business
 BDC,
 publicly


traded
 BDC,
 which
 is
 a
 publicly
 traded


private
 credit
 fund,
 has
 almost
 a


quarter
 of
 their
 assets
 in
 loans
 to


software
 companies.
 Now,
 again,
 software


companies
 are
 all
 different.
 people
 do


different
 things,
 but
 the
 market
 is


looking
 at
 this
 and
 they're
 worried
 that


AI
 could
 cannibalize
 other
 software


companies
 and
 that
 could
 u
 present


downside
 risk
 to
 not
 just
 equities
 but


to
 the
 loans
 that
 people
 made
 to
 these


companies.
 So
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 stocks


of
 the
 managers
 of
 these
 private
 credit


funds,
 they
 all
 took
 a
 dive
 as
 well.
 So


you
 seem
 to
 have
 some
 contagion
 where
 AI


is
 significantly
 disrupting
 adjacent


industries
 and
 software.
 Now
 in
 the
 long


run,
 this
 could
 all
 be
 very
 good.
 we


could
 have
 you
 know
 more
 efficiencies
 uh


lower
 costs
 and
 so
 forth
 but
 but
 in
 the


short
 run
 this
 is
 definitely
 disrupting


existing
 business
 models
 as
 creative


disruption
 always
 does.
 So
 again
 this
 is


probably
 a
 panic
 you
 could
 have
 u
 a
 lot


of
 people
 having
 leverage
 exposure
 to


all
 this
 stuff
 just
 kind
 of
 degrossing


and
 so
 forth
 but
 it
 is
 a
 trend
 to
 watch


for.
 All right
 the
 last
 thing
 that
 I


want
 to
 talk
 about
 of
 course
 is
 crypto.


Now
 this
 last
 week
 we
 saw
 tremendous


volatility
 in
 Bitcoin.
 Now,
 we
 saw


Bitcoin
 drop
 10
 grand
 to
 60,000
 on


Thursday,
 possibly
 a
 bad
 earnings


report,
 but
 then
 it
 did
 rebound
 on


Friday
 to
 above
 70,000.
 But
 when
 you


take
 a
 step
 back,
 you
 look
 at
 it,
 it


looks
 like
 Bitcoin
 has
 basically
 given


up
 all
 the
 gains
 that
 it
 had
 uh
 from
 the


Trump
 uh
 from
 the
 Trump
 boost.
 Now,


President
 Trump
 was
 famously
 going
 to
 be


a
 crypto
 president.
 He
 even
 spoke
 at
 the


Bitcoin
 conference
 and
 was
 greeted
 with


huge
 huge
 uh
 cheers.
 Now
 upon
 his


ascension
 to
 the
 White
 House,
 he
 did


carry
 out
 a
 lot
 of
 pro-
 crypto
 promises.


Uh
 he
 himself
 of
 course
 his
 family
 is


dabbling
 in
 many
 cryptoreated
 ventures.


The
 president
 himself
 launched
 a
 a


Trumpcoin.
 Uh
 he
 did
 shepherd
 in


legislation,
 the
 genius
 act
 that
 created


a
 regulatory
 framework
 for
 dollar
 stable


coins
 and
 even
 suggested
 the
 creation
 of


a
 strategic
 bitcoin
 reserve.
 So
 from
 the


government
 side,
 the
 president
 has


really
 done
 a
 lot
 to
 to
 be
 pro-
 crypto.


Definitely
 a
 sharp
 contrast
 to
 President


Biden.


Now,
 now
 withstanding
 all
 of
 this,
 we


saw
 crypto
 surge
 to
 125,000.


Uh
 it's
 it's
 it's
 it
 seems
 to
 have


fallen
 all
 the
 way
 back.
 And
 so
 I
 think


that
 is
 impacting
 a
 lot
 of
 market


sentiment.
 And
 it's
 not
 just
 Bitcoin.


Bitcoin
 of
 course
 is
 the
 gold
 standard


in
 the
 crypto
 world,
 but
 if
 you
 look
 at


other
 coins,
 they're
 they're
 also
 not


doing
 very
 well.
 It
 seems
 to
 me
 that


there
 there
 is
 a
 very
 much
 a
 crisis
 of


confidence
 in
 the
 crypto
 world.
 So,


everyone
 buys
 and
 sells
 assets
 for


different
 reasons,
 right?
 So,
 it's


always
 care
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 draw


strong
 conclusions.
 But
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 arguments
 of
 proponents
 for


Bitcoin
 and
 other
 crypto
 is
 that
 it's


basically
 a
 hedge
 against
 fiat,
 the


debasement
 trade
 and
 so
 forth.
 And
 what


we've
 seen
 over
 the
 past
 few
 months
 is


that
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 have
 been


benefiting
 from
 the
 debasement
 trade.


Now,
 over
 the
 past
 few
 months,
 you've


seen
 gold
 surge,
 you've
 seen
 silver


surge.
 Now,
 these
 are
 traditional
 what


people
 think
 of
 a
 traditional
 debasement


trades.
 Even
 uh
 let's
 say
 base
 metals


have
 surged,
 say
 copper,
 uh
 stuff
 like


that,
 aluminum.
 And
 over
 the
 past
 year,


you've
 also
 seen
 the
 dollar
 steadily


weaken.
 you
 have
 a
 sell
 America
 trade


that
 emerges
 sometimes
 but
 through
 all


that
 Bitcoin
 just
 continues
 to
 sell
 off


and
 so
 it's
 not
 doing
 what
 many
 people


thought
 it
 would
 do
 and
 so
 there
 is
 a


very
 much
 a
 crisis
 as
 to
 well
 what


drives
 it
 why
 isn't
 going
 up
 why
 isn't


it
 trailing
 gold
 so
 much


and
 of
 course
 you
 will
 have
 people
 who


traded
 on
 technicals
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at


Bitcoin
 it's
 been
 hanging
 out
 below
 the


200
 day
 moving
 average
 for
 some
 time
 and


very
 clearly
 not
 in
 an
 uptrend
 So
 uh


there
 there
 there
 does
 seem
 to
 be
 a
 lot


of
 concern
 there.
 Now
 I
 would
 also
 note


that
 the
 people
 who
 invest
 in
 Bitcoin


honestly
 usually
 are
 techsavvy
 and
 so


they
 could
 be
 invested
 in
 other
 tech


stocks
 as
 well
 and
 so
 you
 could
 have


this
 could
 be
 in
 part
 be
 a
 deleveraging


thing
 where
 people
 who
 are
 invested
 in


say
 tech
 or
 maybe
 high
 momentum
 stuff


like
 silver
 also
 have
 to
 delever
 because


of
 their
 exposure
 um
 to
 to
 these
 clearly


losing
 assets
 and
 that
 bleeds
 into


crypto.
 But
 overall
 though
 it
 does
 seem


like
 um
 things
 are
 not
 looking
 good.
 But


of
 course
 zooming
 out
 you
 know
 that
 many


times
 over
 the
 many
 years
 that
 Bitcoin


has
 gone
 through
 periodic
 winters
 where


prices
 have
 been
 very
 low
 for
 extended


periods
 of
 time
 where
 everyone
 has


written
 them
 off.
 But
 you
 do
 also
 again


see
 it
 for
 whatever
 reason
 surge
 to


surge
 to
 new
 highs.
 So
 it's
 always


difficult
 to
 say.
 This
 is
 all
 obviously


a
 very
 sentiment
 and
 momentum
 driven


asset.
 But
 at
 the
 moment
 though,
 I
 think


many
 people
 who
 bought
 this
 on
 the
 idea


that
 it
 would
 be
 a
 hedge
 against
 fiat
 uh


are
 having
 a
 crisis
 of
 confidence.
 All


right,
 so
 that's
 all
 I
 prepare
 for


today.
 Thanks
 so
 much
 for
 tuning
 in
 and


I'll
 talk
 to
 you
 guys
 next
 week.
