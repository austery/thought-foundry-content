From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Wednesday,
 January
 21st.
 Here's
 what


we're
 covering.


I'm
 Zolen
 Keno
 Youngs.
 I'm
 a
 White
 House


correspondent.
 Any
 minute
 now,
 I'll
 be


heading
 to
 Davos,
 Switzerland
 for
 the


World
 Economic
 Forum.


The
 forum
 is
 a
 gathering
 of
 some
 of
 the


world's
 wealthiest
 and
 most
 powerful


leaders,
 but
 all
 eyes
 will
 be
 on


President
 Trump
 as
 he
 is
 expected
 to


give
 a
 keynote
 address
 amid
 very
 deep


concerns
 over
 the
 future
 of
 the


transatlantic
 alliance.


What
 normally
 would
 have
 been
 a


brainstorming
 session
 amongst
 the


world's
 elites
 has
 turned
 into
 this
 all


hands
 emergency
 effort
 to
 deescalate


tension
 with
 an
 emboldened
 American


president.
 That's
 because
 of
 President


Trump's
 lashing
 out
 at
 European
 leaders


as
 well
 as
 his
 threats
 to
 take
 over


Greenland.
 You
 know,
 I've
 been
 talking


to
 foreign
 policy
 analysts
 who
 say
 that


this
 this
 period
 is
 different,
 right?


Yes,
 President
 Trump
 is
 known
 for


disrupting
 global
 summits
 and,
 you
 know,


brushing
 aside
 allies
 that
 make
 up
 the


current
 global
 order.
 But
 these
 threats


of
 a
 takeover
 of
 Greenland
 really
 have


foreign
 policy
 analysts
 questioning


whether
 or
 not
 the
 nearly
 80year-old


alliance
 between
 the
 US
 and
 European


nations
 may
 be
 at
 risk.


>> Let
 me
 be
 direct.
 We
 are
 in
 the
 midst
 of


a
 rupture,
 not
 a
 transition.


>> Ahead
 of
 President
 Trump's
 remarks,
 the


Prime
 Minister
 of
 Canada,
 Mark
 Carney,


addressed
 the
 rising
 global
 tensions
 in


his
 own
 speech.


>> Every
 day,
 we're
 reminded
 that
 we
 live


in
 an
 era
 of
 great
 power
 rivalry,
 that


the
 rules-based
 order
 is
 fading,
 that


the
 strong
 can
 do
 what
 they
 can
 and
 the


weak
 must
 suffer
 what
 they
 must.
 While


Carney
 didn't
 mention
 Trump
 by
 name,
 he


spoke
 not
 long
 after
 the
 president


posted
 an
 AI
 image
 on
 social
 media


showing
 American
 flags
 superimposed
 over


Canada.
 Part
 of
 Trump's
 ongoing
 jabs


that
 the
 country
 should
 become
 the
 51st


US
 state.
 In
 his
 speech,
 Carney
 called


on
 medium-sized
 countries
 like
 his
 own


to
 band
 together
 to
 offset
 the
 strength


of
 superpowers
 like
 the
 US.
 The
 powerful


have
 their
 power,


but
 we
 have
 something
 too.
 The
 capacity


to
 stop
 pretending,
 to
 name
 reality,
 to


build
 our
 strength
 at
 home,
 and
 to
 act


together.


We
 demand
 more
 from
 our
 federal


government,
 more
 professionalism,
 more


accountability,
 more
 humanity.
 We
 demand


lawful
 policing
 that
 respects
 human


dignity.


>> In
 Minnesota,
 top
 police
 officials
 are


criticizing
 the
 tactics
 being
 used
 by


federal
 immigration
 agents,
 saying
 many


residents
 are
 scared
 to
 go
 outside
 and


that
 the
 agents
 are
 undermining
 trust
 in


law
 enforcement.
 In
 a
 press
 conference


yesterday
 with
 two
 police
 chiefs
 and
 a


county
 sheriff,
 officials
 said
 they
 knew


of
 American
 citizens,
 including
 at
 least


one
 offduty
 police
 officer
 who'd
 been


pulled
 over
 and
 questioned.
 They
 said


they
 were
 all
 people
 of
 color.


>> If
 it
 is
 happening
 to
 our
 officers,
 it


pains
 me
 to
 think
 of
 how
 many
 of
 our


community
 members
 are
 falling
 victim
 to


this
 every
 day.


>> While
 the
 officials
 said
 they
 are
 not


opposed
 to
 immigration
 enforcement,
 they


accused
 ICE
 officers
 deployed
 to
 the


region
 of
 being
 too
 heavy-handed.


>> Can
 we
 please
 find
 a
 way
 to
 make
 sure


that
 we
 can
 do
 these
 things
 without


scaring
 the
 hell
 out
 of
 our
 community


members
 and
 and
 freaking
 everyone
 out?


People
 are
 afraid
 right
 now.
 And
 I
 get


it.


>> In
 response,
 federal
 officials
 defended


the
 behavior
 of
 immigration
 agents
 in


Minnesota,
 saying
 their
 actions
 are


legal,
 ethical,
 and
 moral.


>> Meanwhile,
 the
 Trump
 administration


ramped
 up
 its
 investigation
 into


Democratic
 officials
 in
 Minnesota
 who


have
 been
 critical
 of
 the
 aggressive


immigration
 enforcement
 push
 there.
 The


Department
 of
 Justice
 has
 now
 formally


served
 subpoenas
 to
 five
 officials,


including
 Governor
 Tim
 Walls,
 as
 the


administration
 has
 claimed
 that
 local


leaders
 conspired
 to
 impede
 ICE
 agents


in
 the
 state.
 Without
 citing
 any


evidence,
 the
 deputy
 attorney
 general


has
 accused
 Walls
 and
 the
 mayor
 of


Minneapolis
 of
 terrorism,
 saying
 they'd


encouraged
 violence
 against
 federal


agents.


In
 Texas,
 the
 family
 of
 a
 Cuban


immigrant
 who
 died
 while
 in
 custody
 at


an
 ICE
 detention
 center
 earlier
 this


month
 claims
 that
 he
 was
 killed
 by


guards.
 In
 a
 new
 court
 filing,
 the


family
 asked
 that
 the
 government
 be


blocked
 from
 deporting
 two
 other


detainees
 who
 they
 say
 are
 witnesses.


According
 to
 the
 filing,
 one
 fellow


detainee
 said
 he
 saw
 the
 guards
 choke


the
 man
 to
 death.
 Another
 said
 he
 saw


the
 man
 struggling
 with
 the
 guards


before
 he
 died.
 Both
 have
 since
 been


given
 deportation
 notices.
 Federal


officials
 have
 offered
 a
 different


account.
 Initially,
 ICE
 said
 the
 man
 had


been
 quote
 experiencing
 medical


distress.
 Later,
 after
 the
 Washington


Post
 reported
 on
 the
 family's
 claims,
 a


Department
 of
 Homeland
 Security
 official


said
 he
 had
 died
 by
 suicide
 and
 quote,


"resisted
 interventions
 from
 security


staff."
 According
 to
 the
 man's
 family,
 a


staffer
 at
 the
 El
 Paso
 Medical


Examiner's
 Office
 told
 them
 it
 planned


to
 list
 the
 manner
 of
 death
 as
 homicide.


and
 the
 family
 shared
 a
 recording
 of


that
 conversation,
 though
 the
 Times


could
 not
 verify
 it.
 The
 office
 declined


to
 comment
 on
 the
 recording,
 saying
 an


autopsy
 is
 pending.
 The
 facility
 where


the
 man
 died
 is
 the
 largest
 of
 its
 kind


in
 the
 country
 with
 about
 2700


detainees.
 Last
 year,
 several
 human


rights
 groups
 urged
 federal
 officials
 to


close
 the
 center
 over
 reports
 of
 abuse.


The
 DHS
 called
 those
 claims


categorically
 false.


The
 terrorists
 had
 hate
 in
 their
 hearts,


but
 they
 also
 had
 highpowered
 rifles
 in


their
 hands.
 We're
 taking
 action
 on


both.


>> Australia
 has
 passed
 new,
 tighter
 gun


control
 laws
 in
 the
 wake
 of
 a
 mass


shooting
 targeting
 a
 Hanukkah


celebration
 there
 last
 month.
 The


legislation
 calls
 for
 a
 national
 gun


buyback
 program.
 It
 also
 limits
 firearms


imports
 and
 tightens
 background
 checks.


The
 move
 echoes
 what
 Australia
 did
 back


in
 the9s
 when
 a
 mass
 shooting
 shook
 the


country.
 Almost
 immediately,
 it


tightened
 its
 laws
 and
 did
 a
 massive


buyback.
 A
 fifth
 of
 Australia's
 guns


were
 taken
 out
 of
 public
 circulation.


Since
 then,
 the
 country
 has
 had
 one
 of


the
 lowest
 gun
 homicide
 rates
 per


capita,
 but
 the
 number
 of
 firearms
 has


climbed
 back
 up,
 and
 it's
 now
 at
 a


record
 high.
 The
 details
 of
 how
 the
 new


buyback
 program
 will
 work
 haven't
 been


finalized.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 in
 response


to
 rising
 anti-semitism
 in
 the
 country,


Australia's
 parliament
 also
 passed
 a


bill
 targeting
 hate
 speech.
 It
 gives


authorities
 more
 leeway
 to
 deny
 entry


visas
 to
 people
 with
 extremist
 views
 and


to
 designate
 organizations
 as
 hate


groups,
 though
 some
 critics
 have
 warned


it
 could
 have
 a
 chilling
 effect
 on


protest
 and
 civil
 rights.


And
 finally,
 in
 one
 of
 his
 final
 acts
 in


office,
 the
 governor
 of
 New
 Jersey


signed
 a
 law
 this
 week
 requiring
 that


all
 elementary
 school
 students
 in
 the


state
 learn
 cursive.
 Yes,
 cursive.
 So,


practice
 your
 loop-de-loops
 because
 it


is
 making
 a
 comeback.
 While
 the
 federal


government
 dropped
 cursive
 from
 the


Common
 Core
 standards
 back
 in
 2010,
 New


Jersey
 joins
 roughly
 two
 dozen
 other


states
 that
 have
 revived
 it
 in
 recent


years.
 Proponents
 of
 cursive
 point
 to


studies
 that
 link
 handwriting
 to
 better


information
 retention.
 And
 New
 Jerseyy's


governor
 also
 said
 it
 can
 help
 people


read
 the
 original
 US
 Constitution.
 Not


everyone
 is
 on
 board.
 One
 education


professor
 told
 the
 Times
 that
 while


handwriting
 is
 important,
 valuing


cursive
 specifically
 might
 just
 be
 a


nostalgia
 thing.
 It
 is
 true
 that
 reading


old
 school
 cursive
 is
 a
 dying
 art.
 The


National
 Archives
 actually
 put
 out
 a


call
 for
 help
 last
 year
 looking
 for


volunteers
 who
 could
 read
 the
 script
 on


old
 documents.
 That
 is
 the
 kind
 of
 task


that
 would
 require
 remembering
 what
 an


uppercase
 cursive
 Q
 looks
 like.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.

Mumford.
 We'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow.
