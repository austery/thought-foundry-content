Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.


Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 We


are
 live.
 We've
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.


It
 is
 Thursday,


December
 4th.
 Uh,
 bunch
 of
 different


headlines
 that
 came
 out
 yesterday
 and
 we


will
 discuss
 them.
 The
 biggest
 one
 being


Jensen
 on
 Joe
 Rogan.
 I
 really
 did
 not


expect
 that
 one
 to
 happen,
 but
 it
 did.


And
 we
 got
 a
 bunch
 of
 clips
 from
 that


podcast
 that
 are
 going
 pretty
 viral.
 So,


we'll
 talk
 about
 that.
 Uh,
 I
 got
 some


new
 updates
 this
 morning.
 We
 got
 some


jobless
 claims
 data.
 We
 have
 some
 labor


market
 data.
 Some
 of
 it
 being
 good,
 some


of
 it
 being
 bad.
 We've
 got
 Palunteer.
 I


know
 Palanteer
 has
 not
 really
 been
 in


the
 news
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks,
 ever


since
 earnings.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 have


been
 asking
 what's
 going
 on.
 Well,
 they


put
 out
 an
 announcement
 today
 and
 it's
 a


pretty
 big
 one.
 That
 was
 Oh,
 wow.
 And
 as


I'm
 talking,
 Vlad's
 on
 CNBC.
 All right.


Boom.
 This
 is
 why
 we
 have
 multiple


screens.
 This
 is
 We
 are
 a
 professional


media
 production.


Okay.
 Let's
 go
 to
 Vlad.
 Here
 we
 go.
 This


is
 why
 we
 have
 two
 screens
 and
 then
 uh


we'll
 get
 into
 all
 the
 headlines
 that
 we


got
 today.
 Vlad
 10fo
 of
 Robin
 Hood
 live


right
 now.


>> What
 is
 this
 all
 what
 does
 this
 all


ultimately
 look
 like?
 Meaning
 A,
 who's


using
 it
 and
 how
 are
 they
 using
 it?
 But


B,
 are
 there
 going
 to
 be
 10
 20
 uh
 firms


that
 basically
 are
 doing
 this
 in


different
 ways?
 Is
 there
 is
 it
 all
 going


to
 be
 merged
 up
 into
 two
 or
 three
 of


them?
 What
 does
 this
 look
 like
 in
 your


mind?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 two
 things
 there.
 one
 uh


what
 one
 thing
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 don't


understand
 about
 prediction
 markets
 is


actually
 a
 relatively
 small
 percentage


of
 the
 customers
 that
 are
 interacting


with
 prediction
 markets
 are
 actually


trading
 the
 much
 bigger
 use
 case
 is
 as
 a


source
 of
 information
 almost
 as
 a


>> complement
 or
 alternative
 to
 the
 news


and
 that's
 why
 you
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 news


networks
 starting
 to
 integrate


prediction
 markets
 into
 their
 reporting


I
 think
 prediction
 markets
 are
 going
 to


change
 the
 world
 for
 the
 better.
 Perhaps


they
 already
 have.
 And
 the
 ability
 to


price
 any
 event
 accurately,


I
 think
 solves
 a
 big
 problem
 that
 we've


had
 for
 multiple
 decades,
 which
 is
 we're


flooded
 with
 all
 of
 this
 information.


Anyone
 can
 produce
 content
 and
 share
 an


opinion,
 but
 how
 do
 you
 get
 to
 the


ground?


>> But
 it's
 interesting
 you're
 thinking


about
 it
 more
 and
 tell
 me,
 maybe
 I'm


wrong.
 Are
 you
 thinking
 about
 as
 an


economic
 vehicle,
 meaning
 when
 I
 say


economic
 vehicle,
 something
 as
 an
 an


exchange
 or
 a
 company
 like
 yours
 that


creates
 a
 profitable
 business
 because


you
 know
 millions
 and
 millions
 and


millions
 of
 people
 ultimately


are
 actually
 trading
 in
 the
 prediction


market
 or
 is
 it
 the
 funnel
 of
 data


that's
 coming
 off
 of
 it
 that
 ultimately


is
 more
 valuable?
 I
 think
 that
 in
 terms


of
 what's
 valuable
 for
 society,
 right,


the
 funnel
 of
 data
 is
 much
 more


interesting
 because,
 you
 know,
 whereas


only
 let's
 say
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of


of
 people
 will
 actually
 want
 to
 trade


what's
 happening
 in
 the
 election,


>> the
 information
 of
 who's
 likely
 to
 win


an
 election
 is
 something
 that
 affects


hundreds
 of
 millions.


>> But
 I
 guess
 that's
 where
 I'm
 going
 with


this.
 Ultimately,
 do
 you
 think
 it
 really


is
 only
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 people


who
 will
 trade
 this
 stuff?
 um
 or
 do
 you


think
 it
 actually
 turns
 into
 be
 a
 much


larger
 business,
 the
 trading
 of
 it
 unto


itself?


>> What
 we're
 starting
 to
 see
 is
 that,
 you


know,
 Robin
 Hood,
 we
 started
 with
 one


contract
 uh
 a
 little
 bit
 under
 a
 year


ago,
 which
 was
 the
 presidential
 election


contract,
 and
 now
 we
 have
 over
 1,500
 uh


I
 think
 maybe
 even
 2,000
 or
 more.
 And


that's
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 grow,
 and


it's
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 get
 more


specialized
 and
 granular.
 So
 I
 think
 it


will
 in
 aggregate
 increase
 the
 total


number
 of
 traders
 because


>> I
 mean
 the
 products
 allow
 you
 to


specialize
 relative
 to
 other
 derivative


products.
 They
 have
 pretty
 clear


resolution
 criteria.
 You
 can
 kind
 of


understand
 when
 the
 contract
 resolves


positively
 or
 negatively


>> and
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 worry
 about
 your


exit
 point,
 right?
 the
 exit
 point
 is


sort
 of
 like
 put
 so
 but
 I
 think
 for
 any


individual
 contract
 the
 number
 of


traders
 might
 not
 be
 huge
 but
 in


aggregate
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 lots
 more


contracts


>> the
 other
 prediction
 market
 question
 I


have
 that
 I've
 been
 thinking
 a
 lot
 about


is
 I
 know
 a
 couple
 people
 now
 who
 say


they're
 playing
 the
 prediction
 market
 as


a
 hedge
 against
 other
 things
 that


they're
 doing
 meaning
 they
 might
 own


stocks
 and
 something
 but
 they're
 using


the
 prediction
 market
 as
 a
 hedge
 against


those
 things
 which
 made
 me
 start
 to


think
 well
 then
 when
 we
 see
 the
 results


of
 a
 prediction
 market
 scenario
 scenario


is
 that
 a
 believable
 scenario
 if
 in
 fact


somebody's
 trading
 trading
 it
 to


actually
 offset
 something
 else.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 every
 derivatives
 market
 has


three
 participants.
 You
 have
 the


speculators
 who
 are
 trying
 to
 predict


the
 price.
 You
 have
 hedgers
 that
 are


offloading
 risk
 and
 then
 you
 have


arbitrurers
 who
 are
 connecting
 all
 the


different
 markets
 together.
 And
 I
 think


for
 a
 functional
 market
 there
 has
 to
 be


equilibrium
 of
 those.
 You
 can't
 just


have
 people
 hedging
 to
 your
 point
 um


because
 then
 it
 won't
 reflect
 the
 right


>> it
 wouldn't
 be
 effective
 price
 if
 it


wouldn't
 be
 as
 effective
 of
 a
 hedge


without
 speculators.
 I
 think
 that's


another
 thing
 that
 people
 don't


understand.
 Speculation
 is
 actually


integral
 to
 the
 functioning
 of
 any
 of


any
 market.


>> You
 do
 need
 some
 speculation.


>> Yeah.
 the
 the
 the
 thing
 is
 can
 you
 have


the
 equilibrium
 of
 of
 all
 of
 those


>> and
 and
 I
 do
 think
 to
 your
 first


question
 it's
 going
 to
 evolve
 similarly


to
 other
 equities
 and
 derivatives


markets
 where
 there
 will
 be
 a
 lot
 of


exchanges
 and
 I
 think
 Robin
 Hood


benefits
 in
 that
 world
 because
 a
 lot
 of


exchanges
 means
 lots
 of
 choice
 for
 us
 as


the
 broker
 ultimately
 better
 pricing


more
 competition
 for
 the
 customer
 and


like
 we
 do
 on
 the
 crypto
 side
 or
 the


equity
 side
 we
 connect
 to
 dozens
 of


different
 venues
 and
 market
 makers
 and


route
 to
 whoever
 offers
 the
 best


selection
 and
 price.


>> I
 just
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 hand
 ringing.
 We


had
 had
 Stifel
 on
 the
 other
 day,
 Ron


Chris
 talking
 about
 the
 rise
 of
 all


types
 of
 speculation
 including
 gambling,


prediction
 markets,
 perpetual
 futures,


all
 these
 all
 these
 things.
 And
 then
 I


think
 back
 to
 that
 was
 always
 a
 wrap
 on


commodities.
 Oh,
 it's
 speculation.
 But


the
 the
 real
 use
 for
 commodity
 futures


is
 for
 farmers
 and
 airlines
 that
 are


trying
 to
 hedge
 fuel
 costs.
 I
 mean
 the


the
 most
 of
 the
 trading
 is
 is
 done.
 You


need
 the
 speculators
 for
 the
 liquidity


and
 they
 but
 but
 there's
 a
 real
 use
 case


other
 than
 gambling
 for
 all
 this
 stuff.


>> Well,
 to
 his
 point,
 not
 everyone
 can
 be


hedging.
 You
 need
 the
 spec.


Hedgers
 don't
 have
 accurate
 prices,


>> right?
 But
 yeah,
 uh
 to
 your
 point,
 this


is
 a
 criticism
 as
 old
 as
 time.
 Every


time
 there's
 a
 new
 asset
 class,


>> people
 with
 futures,
 people
 say,
 "Oh
 my


god,
 there's
 there's
 gambling.
 There's


>> the
 meme
 stocks
 were
 gambling."


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


say
 that,
 but
 that


>> there
 were
 no
 speculation
 in
 meme


stocks,
 but
 I
 do
 think


>> but
 also
 they
 that
 might
 have
 cured
 the


naked
 short
 situation
 or
 whatever.
 You


know,
 there
 may
 have
 been
 a
 reason
 for


that
 as
 well.
 It's
 all
 cathartic,
 all


this
 stuff,
 or
 else
 it
 wouldn't
 be


happening,
 right?


>> The
 great
 thing
 about
 markets
 is
 they're


transparent.
 Anyone
 can
 participate
 in


in
 the
 ideal
 case.
 Um,
 and
 you
 bring


together
 lots
 of
 different
 participants


in
 a
 in
 a
 common
 framework.
 And
 I
 think


that's
 why
 this
 has
 been
 so
 disruptive.


>> What
 What
 do
 you
 see
 happening
 with
 your


with
 your
 customer
 base
 right
 now
 as
 it


relates
 to
 crypto?
 Because
 we
 keep


talking
 about
 crypto
 every
 single
 day.


Bitcoin,
 you
 know,
 came
 down.
 I
 mean,


really
 came
 down.
 Now
 where
 we
 we're
 at


92,000.
 So
 the
 low
 recently
 was
 what


about
 85


>> below
 that?


>> Below
 that.
 And
 how
 connected
 do
 you


think
 the
 price
 of
 Bitcoin
 is
 to
 what's


happening
 in
 the
 equity
 markets
 right


now?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 that
 equity
 markets


have
 been
 fairly
 strong
 and
 this
 is
 the


other
 thing
 that
 you
 can
 see
 with


prediction
 markets.
 One
 of
 my
 favorite


things
 to
 look
 at
 is
 the
 Fed
 decision


contracts.
 And
 you
 saw
 toward
 the
 end
 of


October
 of
 this
 year,
 we
 were
 at
 85


roughly
 90%
 chance
 of
 a
 cut
 in
 December.


And
 then
 you
 saw
 the
 odds
 of
 the
 cut


plummeting.
 And
 actually
 towards
 the
 end


of
 November,


the
 leading
 option
 was
 the
 Fed
 would


would
 not
 cut.
 The
 rates
 would
 stay
 the


same.
 And
 and
 you
 saw
 that
 that
 was


basically
 correlated
 with


>> how
 the
 technology
 sector
 did.
 Mhm.


>> So
 the
 these
 things
 are
 are
 very


connected.
 And
 then
 right
 now
 you
 look


at
 the
 the
 odds
 of
 a
 cut
 back
 up
 to
 90%.


And
 the
 markets
 have


>> that's
 what
 we
 just
 were
 saying.
 Now


it's
 the
 next
 cut
 we're
 worried
 about.


Anything
 that
 that
 indicates
 that
 maybe


the
 next
 cut
 is
 in
 and
 it
 is
 in
 question


the
 next
 one
 that
 they
 may
 skip.


>> Absolutely.


>> And
 now
 now
 we're
 worried
 about
 that


one.
 [laughter]


>> You
 can
 track
 the
 markets
 on
 that
 as


well.


>> Um
 but
 yeah,
 I
 think
 Bitcoin
 has


decoupled
 from
 technology
 a
 little
 bit


in
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 weeks.
 And
 I
 think


there's
 idiosyncratic
 concerns
 about
 the


dats
 of
 course.
 Um


>> but
 the
 the
 great
 thing
 about
 our


platform
 we
 we
 offer
 everything
 under


one
 roof.
 So
 prediction
 markets
 are


ripping
 even
 if
 there
 is
 some
 weakness


on
 the
 crypto
 side.
 Customers
 are
 still


depositing
 money.
 They're
 they're


trading
 a
 variety
 of
 assets
 and
 we
 want


to
 be
 there
 financial
 and
 trading
 super.


>> Can
 I
 ask
 you
 real
 quick
 about
 something


that
 I
 think
 you're
 doing
 that's
 super


cool?
 I
 mean,
 you
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 super
 cool


things,
 but
 these
 Trump
 accounts,
 we


didn't
 I
 I
 haven't
 seen
 you
 since
 it
 was


announced
 with
 grad
 and
 and
 with
 DE
 with


with
 the
 Dell
 family.
 I
 think
 it's


unbelievable.
 It's
 really
 extraordinary.


Extraordinary.


>> I
 think
 they
 could
 change
 the
 world.


>> And
 you're
 you're
 involved
 in
 this
 in


terms
 of
 uh
 providing
 some
 of
 the


technology
 or
 what
 what
 do
 you
 how
 how


are
 you
 engaged
 in
 this?


>> Are
 you
 arguing?
 We
 got
 to
 call
 it


something
 else
 for
 for
 you
 people.
 I


mean,
 it


>> you
 mean
 for
 me
 people?


>> Well,
 not
 you
 people.
 Not
 I
 don't
 mean


you.
 I
 mean
 I
 mean
 just
 for
 people
 that


hate
 Trump.
 We
 can't
 call
 it
 Trump.
 We


can't
 call
 because
 they're
 a
 really
 good


thing
 and
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


>> that's
 what
 Gavin
 Gavin
 Newsome


yesterday
 made
 that
 was
 actually
 one
 of


his
 comments.
 He
 said
 that
 [laughter]


Trump
 hijacked
 the
 name
 and
 that
 it


should
 be
 you
 know
 invest
 America
 or


whatever
 it
 can't
 be
 called
 Trump


because
 half
 the
 country
 won't
 won't


like
 it.


>> Look
 at
 Vlad
 just
 sitting
 there
 watching


mom
 and
 dad
 argue
 about
 politics


[laughter]
 and
 he's
 just
 like
 guys
 I'm


just
 providing
 the
 tech.
 You
 can
 call
 it


whatever
 you
 want
 to
 call
 it.


>> No,
 but
 but
 but
 h
 how
 do
 you
 think
 this


is
 going
 to
 get
 implemented?
 How
 easy
 is


it?
 and
 and
 are
 you
 how
 involved
 you
 I


saw
 you
 you
 quoted
 in
 the
 the
 journal


article
 I
 think
 about
 this.


>> Yeah.
 So
 there
 was
 an
 event
 at
 the
 White


House
 to
 announce
 the
 um
 creation
 of
 of


this
 initiative
 as
 part
 of
 the
 budget


reconciliation
 bill
 and
 um
 you
 know
 we
 I


was
 there
 sort
 of
 as
 a
 representative
 of


the
 retail
 brokerage
 industry.
 Um,
 I've


I've
 talked
 to
 the
 president
 about
 this


personally,
 given
 him
 uh
 my
 assurance


that
 I
 care
 a
 lot
 about
 this
 and
 Robin


Hood's
 ready
 to
 give
 technology


resources,
 operational
 resources,
 put


our
 best
 people
 because


>> okay,
 we're
 Scott
 Besson
 and
 get
 this


whole
 whole
 thing.


>> Well,
 I
 I
 think
 this
 super
 important


particularly
 now
 because
 getting
 people


from
 a
 young
 age
 to
 buy
 into
 our
 free


market
 system
 and
 be
 owners
 of
 America,


I
 think
 that
 could
 solve
 a
 lot
 of
 the


problems
 that
 we
 have
 brewing.
 We
 just


put
 out
 for
 Michael
 Dell
 is
 one
 of
 the


good
 billionaires.
 I
 mean,
 most


>> most
 of
 them
 are
 all


>> All right,
 that
 was
 Vlad
 this
 morning
 on


prediction
 markets.
 Again,
 I
 was
 talking


about
 it
 on
 Monday.
 I've
 been
 doing
 a


lot
 of
 research
 on
 it.
 I
 will
 have
 a


Substack
 post
 coming
 soon
 on
 prediction


markets.
 I
 think
 the
 industry
 is
 here
 to


stay
 and
 I
 think
 is
 going
 to
 continue
 to


grow.
 And
 if
 Robin
 is
 a
 major
 player
 in


that
 industry,
 I
 think
 there's
 going
 to


be
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 ways
 that
 they
 can


basically
 use
 what's
 happening
 in
 the


industry
 to
 become
 a
 not
 only
 revenue


stream
 for
 the
 business,
 but
 put
 Robin


Hood
 at
 the
 heart
 of
 the
 intersection
 of


financial
 data
 that
 more
 and
 more
 people


are
 valuing
 and
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


institutions
 are
 going
 to
 value
 that


data
 over
 time
 as
 well.
 All right,
 so


that's
 what
 we
 had
 with
 Vlad
 on
 CNBC.


Let's
 get
 to
 the
 Palenteer
 partnership


that
 announced
 this
 morning.
 So
 this
 is


a
 pretty
 big
 deal.
 Uh
 Palunteer
 has


launched
 a
 brand
 new
 product.
 So
 they


have
 Foundry,
 they
 have
 um
 Apollo,
 they


have
 AIP,
 they
 have
 Warp
 Speed,
 which


was
 kind
 of
 like
 re-industrializing


America.


Now
 they
 are
 introducing
 an
 operating


system
 for
 American
 AI
 infrastructure


aka
 they
 are
 getting
 into
 the
 data


center
 race.
 Pounder
 launches
 chain


reaction.
 That
 is
 the
 name
 of
 this
 new


product
 and
 the
 founding
 partner
 of
 this


product.
 Founding
 partners
 are


centerpoint
 energy
 and
 Nvidia
 chain


reaction
 aims
 to
 transform
 aging
 power


generation
 into
 high
 uptime
 resources


capable
 of
 meeting
 AI's
 massive
 demand.


Stabilize
 and
 expand
 the
 power
 grid
 to


meet
 surging
 demand
 from
 data
 centers


and
 electrification.
 accelerate


construction
 of
 new
 generation


transmission
 in
 compute
 capacity
 and


enable
 the
 design
 development
 and


reproductive
 uh
 reproducibility
 of


future
 hypers
 scale
 data
 centers


supporting
 AI
 workloads.
 So
 everything


we've
 been
 hearing
 about
 data
 centers,


every
 deal
 we've
 been
 seeing,
 Google


spending
 40
 billion,
 Meta
 spending
 28


billion,
 all
 of
 that
 accelerating
 at


scale,
 I
 mean
 last
 week
 Amazon
 spent
 60


or
 announced
 they
 were
 spending
 65


billion,
 15
 billion
 in
 um
 Indiana
 and
 50


billion
 in
 Virginia
 for
 data
 centers.


Palunteer
 is
 like,
 "Wait
 a
 second.
 If


you're
 going
 to
 build
 all
 these
 data


centers,
 if
 you're
 going to
 have
 all


this
 energy
 infrastructure,
 if
 you're


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 manage
 the
 ecosystem


that
 is
 required
 to
 get
 these
 data


centers
 online
 and
 actually
 make
 AI


real,
 because
 without
 the
 data
 centers,


without
 the
 energy,
 without
 the
 compute,


it's
 not
 possible.
 Our
 software
 should


be
 at
 the
 front
 lines
 of
 this."
 Um,
 vice


president
 of
 AI
 infrastructure
 at
 NVIDIA


said,
 "A
 new
 industrial
 revolution
 has


begun.
 one
 where
 intelligence
 is


manufactured
 at
 scale
 through
 an


extraordinary
 complex
 supply
 chain
 of
 AI


infrastructure
 now
 being
 built
 across


America
 to
 strengthen
 our
 economy,


workforce,
 and
 security.
 By
 partnering


with
 Palanteer
 in
 our
 ecosystem,
 we
 are


accelerating
 the
 transformation
 powering


the
 engines
 of
 the
 AI
 age,
 transforming


data
 into
 intelligence,
 and
 securing


America's
 technology
 leadership
 for


decades
 to
 come.
 And
 of
 course,
 as
 I'm


announcing
 this,
 Meta
 is
 pumping.
 I


can't
 get
 through
 one
 news
 story
 today


without
 something
 else
 happening.


Goodness
 gracious.
 Meta
 3%
 right
 here.


Why
 is
 Meta
 pumping?
 Did
 they
 announce
 a


new
 Oh,
 but
 Chris
 is
 about
 if
 Chris
 is


sleeping.
 This
 is
 going
 to
 somehow
 he's


just
 going
 to
 know
 that
 his
 options
 are


printing
 right
 now
 and
 he's
 going
 to


wake
 up
 somewhere.


Okay.
 Why
 is
 Meta
 moving?
 Can't
 even
 get


through
 my
 pounder
 segment.
 What's
 going


on
 with
 Meta?


I
 don't
 see
 a
 headline.
 There's
 got
 to


be
 something
 coming
 pretty
 soon.
 We'll


talk
 about
 we'll
 get
 back
 to
 pounder
 in


a
 second.
 Let
 me
 just
 see
 the
 reason
 why


Chris
 is
 not
 sleep.
 See,
 I
 knew
 he
 was


there.
 I
 knew
 he
 was
 there.


Um


Oh
 my
 goodness.
 Oh
 my
 goodness.
 He
 did


it.
 He
 did
 it.
 Meta
 Zuckerberg
 plans
 up


to
 30%
 cuts
 for
 metaverse
 efforts.
 Oh
 my


goodness.
 Zucks
 woke
 up
 and
 he
 realized


he
 can't
 keep
 spending
 on
 the
 metaverse.


Wow.


Wow.
 By
 the
 way,
 Chris,
 Steve,
 and
 I
 had


a
 had
 a
 Meta
 podcast
 like
 three
 weeks


ago,
 and
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we
 all
 agreed


on
 was
 that
 if
 Zucks
 comes
 out
 and
 says,


"Yeah,
 we
 kind
 of
 don't
 need
 some
 of


these
 initiatives
 like
 Reality
 Labs


anymore,
 and
 just
 says,
 "Hey,
 we're


going
 to
 pull
 back
 a
 little
 bit.
 Stock's


going
 to
 go
 up."
 That's
 that's
 all
 they


had
 to
 do.
 That's
 all
 they
 had
 to
 do.


And
 this
 was
 part
 of
 Chris's
 thesis.


That's
 why
 he
 bought
 those
 naked
 calls.


He
 knew
 that
 or
 he
 at
 least
 had
 a
 thesis


that
 eventually
 Zux
 would
 pull
 back
 some


of
 this
 honestly
 nonsense
 spending
 and


the
 stock
 would
 react
 to
 that.
 Look
 at


that.
 Zuck
 said,
 "I
 want
 to
 be
 in
 this


Santa
 Claus
 rally
 as
 well
 and
 I
 am


pulling
 back
 my
 spend."


Wow,
 dude.
 This
 was
 also
 This
 makes
 so


much
 sense.
 Like
 no
 one
 uses
 the


metaverse.
 They
 lost
 $4
 billion
 last


quarter.
 Not
 last
 year,
 last
 quarter.
 In


90
 days,
 they
 lost
 four
 billion
 on


something
 no
 one
 uses.


30
 bucks
 on
 the
 day.
 And
 it's
 going
 it's


it's
 not
 stopping.
 $34
 5
 6
 72
 on
 Meta.


Oh,
 but
 Chris
 is
 not
 going
 to
 work


today.
 Chris
 is
 Chris
 is
 going
 to
 be


staring
 at
 these
 options
 all
 day.
 There


you
 go.
 Congratulations
 if
 you
 bought


the
 Meta
 Dip.
 I
 mean,
 I
 bought
 the
 Meta


Dip.
 I
 did
 not
 buy
 as
 heavily
 as
 our


friend,
 Mr.
 Chris
 Patel
 and
 that's
 why
 I


shouldn't
 get
 the
 crazy
 gains
 as
 our


friend
 Chris
 Patel.
 This
 is
 the
 beauty


of
 the
 market.
 If
 you
 have
 conviction,


if
 you
 go
 against
 the
 the
 consensus


opinion
 and
 you
 take
 a
 heavy
 bet,
 you


could
 be
 rewarded.
 And
 so
 for
 those
 that


heavily
 heavily
 bought
 this
 meta
 dip,


congratulations.
 Uh
 this
 is
 big
 and
 I


think
 when
 the
 market
 opens
 now,
 could


this
 get
 sold
 off
 when
 the
 market
 opens?


Sure,
 anything
 is
 possible.
 But
 if
 it


gets
 sold
 off,
 people
 are
 buying
 that


dip
 again
 because
 guess
 what?
 EPS
 just


went
 up.
 Operating
 income
 just
 went
 up.


Free
 cash
 flow
 just
 went
 up.
 I
 mean,


pretty
 pretty
 much
 every
 operating


metric
 that
 Wall
 Street
 cares
 about,


especially
 in
 the
 age
 of
 hyper
 capex


spend
 where
 Wall
 Street
 wants
 to
 see


certain
 verticals
 that
 are
 um


effectively
 being
 spent
 even
 if
 your


capex
 is
 high.
 All
 of
 those
 metrics
 just


went
 up.
 If
 this
 report
 is
 correct,
 that


Zucks
 is
 pulling
 back
 metaverse
 spending


by
 30%.


There
 you
 go.
 [laughter]
 That's
 why


Chris
 was
 in
 your
 dream,
 dude.
 I
 said


yes.
 You
 guys
 didn't
 believe
 me.
 Chris


was
 in
 my
 dream
 yesterday
 saying
 buy


meta.
 I
 woke
 up
 thinking
 of
 Chris.
 I'm


like,
 why
 am
 I
 thinking
 of
 Chris,
 dude?


And
 I
 realized,
 dude,
 he
 was
 just
 in
 my


dream.
 There
 you
 go.
 Congratulations
 if


you
 bought
 the
 meta
 dip
 heavily.
 There


you
 go.
 5.2%
 673.
 If
 you
 have
 Meta


Options,
 those
 are
 going
 to
 be
 up
 much


more
 than
 5%
 on
 the
 day.


And
 here
 is
 the
 move.
 Matias
 says,
 "I


loaded
 up
 on
 Meta
 under
 600
 with
 a


screaming
 bot."
 You
 know
 what's
 going
 to


happen
 today
 as
 well?
 A
 lot
 of
 people


are
 going
 to
 jump
 into
 Meta.


lot
 of
 pe
 because
 you
 know
 the
 market


waits
 for
 a
 piece
 of
 news
 that
 can


change
 the
 narrative.
 The
 people
 that


buy
 the
 dip
 believe
 that
 the
 narrative


will
 be
 changed
 before
 the
 narrative


changes
 and
 that's
 you
 know
 Google


shareholders
 saw
 that
 heavily
 happen
 uh


this
 year.
 If
 you
 bought
 stocks
 in
 2023


when
 narratives
 were
 really
 bad
 and
 then


the
 narratives
 changed
 you
 saw
 that


happen
 as
 well.
 And
 you
 know
 this
 is


another
 classic
 example
 happening
 with


Meta.
 So
 we'll
 see
 when
 the
 market
 opens


if
 this
 can
 sustain
 itself.
 I
 find
 it


very
 hard
 to
 believe
 it
 completely
 sells


off
 but
 this
 is
 a
 big
 deal.
 I'll
 try
 to


get
 some
 more
 details
 on
 it.
 Right
 now,


the
 headline
 is
 Zux
 is
 pulling
 back
 30%


um
 of
 metaverse
 spend.


And
 also
 the
 other
 meta
 news
 we're
 about


to
 talk
 about
 is
 that
 um
 is
 that
 uh
 they


just
 they
 just
 poached
 one
 of
 Apple's


senior
 design
 engineers
 to
 to
 work
 on


Meta
 or
 to
 to
 work
 on
 a
 new
 product
 at


Meta.
 So
 that
 that's
 also
 a
 big
 piece
 of


news
 just
 given
 the
 person
 who
 left


Apple
 has
 been
 there
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 Uh


Mark
 Zuckerberg
 and
 Meta
 have
 reportedly


expected
 to
 meaningfully
 cut
 resources


for
 building
 the
 Metaverse.
 Executives


have
 reportedly
 discussed
 potential


budget
 cuts
 as
 high
 as
 30%
 for
 the


Metverse
 group
 next
 year.
 So
 this
 won't


show
 up
 in
 the
 next
 quarter's
 earnings,


but
 for
 fiscal
 year
 guidance
 2026,
 that


could
 have
 a
 meaningful
 increase
 if


they're
 cutting
 30%
 of
 the
 spend
 for
 the


metaverse.


Now
 granted,
 that
 spend
 might
 leave
 the


metaverse
 and
 go
 to
 capex.
 So
 there


there
 is
 a
 nuance
 here
 that
 the
 spend


might
 not
 automatically
 show
 up
 in
 the


operating
 metrics
 because
 it's
 it's
 just


being
 diverted
 spend.
 However,
 if
 it's


being
 diverted
 spend
 on
 something
 that


has
 a
 real
 chance
 of
 working
 like
 AI,


not
 a
 metaverse
 that
 no
 one
 uses,
 then


maybe
 the
 street
 forgives
 it.
 You
 know,


maybe
 the
 street
 doesn't
 send
 it
 back
 to


800
 anytime
 soon,
 but
 the
 street


forgives
 it
 and
 they're
 more
 excited
 to


bet
 Zucks
 on
 spending
 another
 15
 billion


on
 capex
 versus
 15
 billion
 on
 the


metaverse.


So
 there
 you
 go.
 There
 you
 go.
 Yeah.
 And


look,
 this
 is
 actually
 bullish
 Nvidia


because
 if
 it
 is
 going
 to
 go
 back
 to


GPUs,
 bullish
 Broadcom,
 Nvidia,
 Google,


if
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 more
 TPUs,
 AMD,


you
 know,
 Meta
 is
 like
 I
 think
 AMD's


biggest
 customer
 or
 their
 second
 largest


customer.
 So
 you
 got
 Nvidia
 getting
 a


little
 pump
 right
 there
 as
 well,
 0.53%.


And
 you
 know,
 honestly,
 this
 is
 bullish


the
 entire
 market
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 that


spend
 on
 the
 metaverse
 was
 doing
 nothing


for
 all
 of
 us.
 Definitely
 was
 doing


nothing
 for
 Metaverse
 shareholders
 or


for
 Meta
 shareholders.
 So
 if
 that
 spin


is
 diverting
 and
 just
 going
 into
 other


initiatives
 and
 eventually
 into
 other


stocks
 that
 benefit
 from
 those


initiatives
 that
 all
 of
 us
 own
 that
 yeah


that's
 actually
 a
 really
 good


announcement
 for
 the
 entire
 market
 not


just
 Meta
 itself.
 Meta
 right
 there
 5.7%


675


on
 the
 day.


All right
 so
 that's
 what
 you
 got
 for
 Z.


We'll
 get
 back
 to
 that
 story
 in
 a
 bit


and
 we'll
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 some
 more


details
 to
 wrap
 up
 what's
 going
 on
 in


the
 world
 of
 Palunteer.
 Again
 I
 think


the
 Pounder
 announcement
 is
 a
 very
 very


very
 big
 deal.
 They
 are
 partnering
 with


Nvidia
 to
 build
 a
 brand
 new
 product.
 The


founding
 partner
 of
 this
 new
 product


called
 chain
 reaction
 is
 Nvidia.
 And
 it


looks
 like
 Palenter
 is
 bringing
 their


software
 to
 one
 of
 the
 largest


industries
 growing
 at
 an
 exponential


pace
 which
 is
 data
 center
 and
 energy.


Now
 the
 pounder
 quote
 from
 this
 uh
 is


right
 here.


Let
 me
 pull
 this
 up.
 This
 is
 from


Tristan
 Grusa
 who's
 the
 head
 of


Pounder's
 energy
 and
 infrastructure
 uh


in
 investments
 and
 buildout.
 The
 energy


infrastructure
 buildout
 is
 the


industrial
 challenge
 of
 our
 generation.


Yet
 the
 software
 that
 the
 sector
 relies


on
 was
 not
 built
 for
 this
 moment.
 We


have
 spent
 years
 quietly
 deploying


systems,
 keeping
 power
 plants
 running,


grid
 stable,
 and
 orchestrating
 complex


supply
 chains.
 Chain
 reaction
 is
 what
 it


looks
 like
 when
 you
 rebuild
 from
 the


ground
 up
 for
 the
 demands
 of
 AI.


Very
 big
 deal.
 Makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.
 Uh


I
 think
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of
 those


announcements
 that
 look,
 I
 don't
 know
 if


it
 has
 any
 impact
 on
 the
 stock
 today


because
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 it's
 a


new
 product
 announcement.
 It's
 not


necessarily
 a
 brand
 new
 like
 contract
 or


anything.
 But
 if
 you
 think
 data
 centers


are
 uh
 going
 to
 be
 a
 very
 large


industry.
 We
 looked
 at
 some
 JP
 Morgan


reports
 two
 days
 ago
 that
 showed
 just


the
 kager
 of
 the
 tan
 of
 data
 centers.


Yeah,
 it's
 obvious
 you're
 going
 to
 need


software
 to
 make
 that
 like
 real
 and
 to


operationalize
 it
 in
 a
 meaningful
 way.
 I


mean
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 10
 gawatt
 15
 gawatt


deals
 like
 none
 of
 them
 have
 gone


online.
 And
 for
 them
 to
 go
 online
 you


have
 a
 massive
 bottleneck
 of
 energy
 more


than
 compute
 and
 the
 software
 needed
 to


make
 all
 that
 happen.
 I
 think
 obviously


should
 be
 one
 of
 the
 companies
 like


Pounder
 that
 has
 a
 relationship
 and


experience
 with
 managing
 complex
 data


sets
 for
 energy.
 So
 really
 important


partnership
 for
 Pounder
 and
 Nvidia
 makes


sense
 that
 they
 announced
 this
 today
 and


I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 Pounder
 play


a
 heavy
 role
 in
 the
 data
 center
 buildout


which
 again
 is
 them
 expanding
 their
 TAM


their
 revenue
 potential
 and
 them
 being


at
 the
 heart
 of
 this
 AI
 buildout.
 Meta


right
 here
 6.2%
 on
 the
 day
 679.


For
 those
 that
 are
 just
 joining,
 Zux
 is


pulling
 back
 metaverse
 spend
 allegedly.


Um,
 as
 for
 Bloomberg
 and
 680


pre-markets,
 that's
 why
 this
 stock
 is
 up


6.4%.


Could
 the
 Santa
 Claus
 rally
 be
 starting?


Well,
 December
 3rd
 again
 was
 the
 worst


day
 in
 December
 historically.
 We
 got


through
 December
 3rd
 yesterday.
 S&P
 was,


you
 know,
 relatively
 flat.
 Uh,
 this
 Meta


announcement
 is
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 way
 to
 start


the
 Santa
 Claus
 rally
 if
 we
 are


officially
 starting
 it.
 And
 again,
 it's


not
 just
 good
 for
 Meta
 shareholders.
 I


mean,
 Nvidia's
 up
 1%.
 Why
 is
 Nvidia
 up


1%?
 Because
 it's
 kind
 of
 obvious
 if
 Zux


is
 not
 spending
 on
 the
 metaverse,
 he's


probably
 going
 to
 be
 spending
 a
 little


bit
 more
 on
 Capex
 or
 a
 lot
 more
 on
 Capex


and
 that
 helps
 everyone
 else.


Roy
 says,
 "I
 entered
 50%
 of
 my
 portfolio


yesterday
 to
 Meta
 Shares."
 Wow.


[laughter]
 Pretty
 good
 timing
 for
 anyone


who
 bought
 the
 meta
 dip
 in
 size
 over
 the


past
 couple
 of
 weeks.
 I
 mean,
 pretty


pretty
 freaking
 good
 timing,


dude.
 Chris
 is
 about
 to
 buy
 a
 jet.
 Chris


Chris
 doesn't
 have
 spreads
 on
 Meta.


Remember,
 with
 spreads,
 you
 cap
 your


profits
 because
 you
 have
 the
 uh
 short


call
 counteracting
 your
 long
 call.
 It


reduces
 your
 premium
 you
 have
 to
 pay,


reduces
 your
 risk,
 but
 it
 also
 caps
 your


profit.
 With
 naked
 calls,
 your
 profit
 is


theoretically
 infinite.
 like
 Meta
 could


just
 keep
 going
 up
 and
 up
 and
 up
 and
 the


calls
 could
 just
 keep
 getting
 more
 and


more
 valuable


and
 that's
 why
 we're
 getting
 some


momentum.
 Chris,
 I'm
 gonna
 give
 you
 a


call
 right
 real
 quick.
 Let's
 get
 your


take
 on
 this
 and
 uh
 then
 we'll
 keep


going
 from
 there
 for
 again
 for
 those


that
 are
 joining
 Meta
 right
 here
 up
 6%


on
 the
 news
 that
 they
 are
 cutting


efforts
 on
 the
 metaverse.
 Real
 quick,


let
 me
 just
 show
 you
 guys
 the
 jobs
 data.


It
 wasn't
 that
 different
 from
 what
 we've


heard
 before.
 So
 in
 the
 month
 of


November,
 US
 employers
 made
 71,000
 new


layoffs.
 That
 is
 up
 to
 1.17
 million


layoffs
 for
 the
 year.
 This
 now
 marks
 the


first
 year
 with
 1.1
 million
 job
 cuts


since
 the
 pandemic
 lockdowns
 in
 2020.


That
 means
 that
 we
 need
 to
 cut
 rates.


That
 means
 that
 we
 need
 to
 cut
 rates.
 So


71,000
 layoffs
 in
 November.
 Uh
 the


highest
 level
 of
 layoffs
 since
 2020.


Obviously,
 it
 means
 we
 probably
 should


be
 cutting
 rates.
 The
 other
 piece
 of
 job


data
 that
 is
 actually
 relatively
 bullish


is
 jobless
 claims
 we
 get
 every
 Thursday.


Came
 in
 at
 191,000.
 The
 street
 thought


it
 would
 come
 in
 at
 220,000.


So
 again,
 the
 labor
 market
 is
 weakening.


We
 should
 be
 getting
 this
 rate
 cut,
 but


it's
 not
 deteriorating.
 And
 I
 think


that's
 a
 very,
 very,
 very
 important


nuance
 for
 everyone
 to
 remember.
 If


jobless
 claims
 were
 at
 like
 300,000,
 we


would
 have
 an
 issue.
 They're
 at
 191,000.


Not
 good,
 but
 definitely
 not
 horrible.


And
 it
 means
 that
 there
 is
 a
 world
 which


we
 get
 a
 rate
 cut,
 but
 the
 labor
 market


doesn't
 deteriorate,
 which
 ultimately


means
 that
 corporate
 earnings
 can
 be


strong
 with
 the
 Fed
 easing.
 And
 that


means
 it
 could
 set
 up
 for
 a
 strong
 bull


market
 going
 into
 2026.


Chris
 Patel,
 good
 morning.


>> I
 am
 about
 to
 send
 you
 something
 very


interesting.
 Let
 me
 just
 uh
 hold
 on
 one


second.
 So,
 remember
 that
 day
 when


>> Chris,
 get
 closer
 to
 the
 mic.
 It's
 a


little
 it's
 a
 little
 hard
 to
 hear
 you.


>> All right.
 You
 remember
 when
 we
 were


talking
 about
 Meta
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Hey,


listen.
 I'm
 about
 750,000
 deep
 in
 this


thing."


>> Uh,
 yes,
 I
 do
 remember
 that
 because


that's
 a
 pretty
 aggressive
 bet
 to
 make.


>> I
 lied.
 I
 got
 1.25
 million


and
 all
 naked
 calls.
 Bro,


after
 our
 conversation,
 I
 was
 like,
 I


don't
 get
 this
 bullish
 on
 things
 without


sort
 of
 convictions.
 I
 was
 like,
 you


know
 what?
 So,
 I
 cleared
 up
 some
 of
 my


uh
 returns
 on
 my
 IRA
 and
 I
 bought
 a
 lot


of
 calls
 on
 there,
 too.
 I
 just
 sent
 it


to
 you.
 Take
 a
 look.


>> Oh,
 boy.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 You
 know
 how
 when
 you
 had


that
 Robin
 Hood
 conviction,
 you
 were


just
 like,
 "Screw
 it,
 man.
 I
 don't
 care


what
 it
 is.
 Let's
 go."
 I
 was
 like,
 "You


know
 what?
 I've
 got
 conviction,
 too."


So,
 I
 just
 uh


>> Are
 you
 saying
 you
 learned
 from
 me
 on


this
 trade?
 Am
 I
 responsible?


>> I
 I
 would
 say
 Yeah.
 Well,
 yeah.
 Yeah.


You
 know,
 I
 also
 was
 like
 listening
 to
 a


lot
 of
 drug.
 I
 was
 like,
 "Dude,
 if
 you


know
 what
 you're
 doing
 and
 you
 know,


don't
 be
 afraid
 to
 take


>> Oh,
 hold
 on.
 Hold
 on.
 Let's
 play
 that


clip
 real
 quick.
 This
 is
 why
 you
 I
 I
 was


wondering
 why
 you
 shared
 this
 clip


yesterday.


I
 was
 wondering.
 Let's
 share
 this
 clip


real
 quick
 and
 then
 we'll
 go


>> under
 his
 cut,
 bro.
 Come
 [laughter]
 on,


man.


>> No,
 no,
 no,
 no.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


need
 any
 cut.
 First
 of
 all,
 Chris
 is
 the


reason
 I
 even
 learned
 about
 options
 in


the
 first
 place.
 But,
 dude,
 I'm
 happy


for
 you.
 It's
 not
 easy
 to
 go
 1
 million


deep
 into
 a
 trade.
 And
 that
 1
 million,


theoretically,
 these
 are
 naked
 calls,


could
 turn
 into
 a
 lot
 more
 than
 1


million.
 But
 this
 is
 what
 Ducken
 Miller


said
 and
 what
 Chris
 shared
 yesterday,


which
 kind
 of
 sums
 up
 the
 entire
 uh
 meta


trade.


>> Well,
 my
 idea
 of
 risk
 control
 is
 a


little
 non-conventional.


I
 like
 putting
 all
 my
 eggs
 in
 one
 basket


and
 then
 watching
 the
 basket
 very


carefully.
 I
 think
 uh
 [laughter]


I
 don't
 know
 what
 they
 teach
 at


Marshall,
 but
 at
 most
 business
 schools


they
 teach
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 nonsense


called
 risk
 adjusted
 return
 and


diversification.


>> As
 a
 money
 manager,


if
 if
 you
 look
 at
 a
 normal
 portfolio,


most
 people
 will
 make
 70
 80%
 of
 money


that
 year
 on
 two
 or
 three
 ideas,
 even


though
 they'll
 have
 30
 or
 40
 things
 in


their
 portfolio.


My
 concept
 was
 to
 put
 into
 those
 two
 or


three
 ideas
 that
 I
 had
 the
 most


conviction
 in.
 I
 was
 also
 lucky
 to


travel
 across
 asset
 classes.
 So
 I
 traded


commodities,
 currencies,
 bonds,
 and


equities.
 And
 it
 gave
 me
 the
 discipline.


If
 I
 didn't
 have
 a
 good
 idea
 in


equities,
 I
 was
 happy
 to
 have
 no


equities
 or
 put
 all
 my
 eggs
 in
 one


basket
 and
 watch
 that
 basket.
 So,
 here's


the
 question,
 Chris,
 before
 I
 even
 get


into
 the
 your
 opinions
 on
 the
 actual


announcement.
 Uh,
 are
 you
 taking
 any


profits
 this
 morning?


>> Uh,
 no.
 No.
 I
 think
 Meta
 is
 gonna
 Meta


is
 going
 to
 get
 rerated
 much
 higher.
 If


you
 look
 at
 how
 much
 cash
 flow
 that
 was


deployed
 to
 the
 reality
 lab
 section
 and


then
 how
 much
 cash
 flow
 these
 guys
 were


generating
 on
 top.
 Anyway,
 there
 was
 a


lot
 of
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 bullishness
 behind


it.
 So
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 we're


seeing
 today
 is
 you
 know
 and
 this
 is
 not


something
 that's
 hasn't
 happened
 in
 the


past.
 If
 you
 guys
 remember
 when
 when


Zuck
 was
 challenged
 in
 2022,


you
 know,
 he
 cut
 the
 he
 cut
 the
 fat


where
 he
 needed
 to
 to
 invest
 in
 the


things
 that
 needed
 to
 get
 invested
 in
 so


that
 this
 way
 he
 could
 maintain
 high


levels
 of
 growth
 within
 the
 company,


right?
 So
 that's
 the
 one
 thing
 I
 mean
 if


you
 look
 at
 last
 year
 and
 early
 parts
 of


this
 year,
 he
 ended
 all
 DEI
 programs
 and


started
 cutting
 all
 low
 performers.
 So


you
 know
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day


Zuckerberg
 is
 and
 he's
 the
 largest


shareholder
 of
 the
 company.
 He's
 the


founder.
 the
 one
 thing
 he's
 not
 going
 to


do
 is
 let
 this
 company
 flounder
 by
 any


means,
 you
 know.
 So,
 as
 much
 as
 as
 much


of
 a
 ideologue
 he
 is
 when
 it
 comes
 to


these
 passion
 projects,
 and
 I
 think


he'll
 still
 invest
 in
 the
 metaverse,


don't
 get
 me
 wrong.
 It's
 just
 right
 now


the
 metaverse
 is
 not
 the
 most
 important


thing
 to
 the
 market,
 to
 shareholders,


and
 to
 the
 company.
 So,
 you
 know,
 it's


and
 and
 believe
 it
 or
 not,
 guys,


everyone
 who's
 in
 the
 mega
 cap
 space,


they
 have
 to
 try
 new
 things.
 If
 you


don't
 try
 new
 things,
 you're
 going
 to


run
 into
 the
 innovator's
 dilemma.
 You


know,
 your
 your
 core
 markets
 are


eventually
 going
 to
 get
 challenged
 by


newcomers
 and
 the
 newcomers
 are
 going
 to


eat
 away.
 Like
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 the


problem
 with
 companies
 like
 Apple
 in
 my


opinion
 where
 Apple's
 topline
 growth
 has


basically
 been
 flat
 and
 they
 haven't


really
 been
 investing
 too
 much
 into


other
 things.
 Now
 guess
 their
 cash
 flows


are
 supported
 massive
 amounts
 of
 share


buybacks
 which
 has
 provided
 shareholder


returns
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 in
 terms
 of


future
 growth
 Apple
 is
 there
 for


stability
 but
 they
 could
 be
 challenged


you
 know
 so
 that's
 the
 key
 so
 I
 think


all
 the
 mega
 caps
 they
 have
 side
 hustles


look
 at
 Elon
 Elon
 has
 everything
 going


but
 he
 still
 has
 multiple
 side
 hustles


dude
 Amazon
 loves
 failing
 fast
 they
 try


new
 things
 all
 the
 time
 does
 the
 same


thing
 Google
 dude
 Google
 the
 amount
 of


money
 that
 they
 like
 spent
 on
 all
 these


side
 projects.


>> Yeah.


>> Insane.
 They
 lose
 money
 on
 Quantum.


They've
 lost
 money
 on
 Whimo
 for
 a


decade.
 They've
 lost
 money
 on
 so
 many


things.
 But
 the
 thing
 is,
 all
 you
 need


is
 that
 one
 thing
 to
 hit
 and
 what


happens?
 You're
 your
 your
 your
 next
 leg


of
 growth
 is
 going
 to
 explode.
 And
 I


think
 with
 Zuckerberg,
 they've
 really


hit
 the
 head
 nail
 on
 the
 head
 when
 it


comes
 to
 AI.
 And
 they
 unlike
 the
 other


businesses
 that
 are
 still
 kind
 of


discovering
 how
 to
 generate
 more


profitability,
 dude,
 he's
 getting


instant
 ROI
 right
 now.
 If
 you
 look
 at


their
 cash
 flow
 statement
 on
 it,
 they


doubled
 operating
 cash
 flow
 in
 the
 last


two
 and
 a
 half
 years.


>> Okay.
 So
 here
 here
 here's
 the
 question


then.
 So
 AI
 is
 giving
 them
 an
 ROI
 on


advertising.
 That's
 fair.
 The
 street
 was


upset
 because
 they
 don't
 see
 anything


else
 besides
 advertising.
 At least
 that


was
 the
 narrative.
 Do
 you
 think
 this


counteracting
 of
 balance
 sheet


efficiency
 by
 by
 getting
 rid
 of
 some
 of


the
 metaverse
 costs
 and
 potentially
 just


putting
 that
 into
 the
 capex,
 do
 you


think
 that
 helps
 change
 the
 narrative


that
 the
 street
 was
 upset
 about
 or
 or


how
 do
 you
 think
 the
 street's
 going
 to


interpret
 this
 long
 term?


>> No,
 I
 mean
 even
 even
 from
 a
 even
 from
 a


capex
 perspective,
 dude,
 if
 you
 look
 at


the
 transaction
 that
 they
 did
 with
 Blue


Blue
 Owl,
 right?
 So
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 they


saw
 that
 and
 they
 were
 like
 wow
 this


these
 guys
 are
 headed
 into
 the
 same


direction
 that
 Oracle
 is
 where
 they're


promising
 all
 this
 capex
 but
 the
 ROI
 is


not
 there
 and
 I'm
 like
 don't
 if
 you


really
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 deal
 that
 they


structured
 with
 Blue
 Owl
 it's
 very
 very


value
 accreative
 to
 shareholders
 where


basically
 the
 one
 big
 beautiful
 bill


came
 in
 and
 and
 made
 it
 so
 that
 you


could
 immediately
 expense
 certain


certain
 um
 certain
 things
 from
 your


capex
 right
 so
 before
 like
 Let's
 say
 you


built
 a
 building,
 right?
 You
 would
 spend


the
 next
 30
 years
 depreciating
 that


building
 at
 at
 a
 very
 low
 amount
 every


single
 year.
 So
 now
 you're
 taking
 all
 of


this
 capital
 and
 locking
 it
 away.
 The


deal
 that
 they
 did
 with
 Blue
 Owl
 was


that
 Blue
 Owl
 would
 build
 these
 build


the
 infrastructure.
 Meta
 would
 supply


the
 GPUs
 that
 Meta
 could
 immediately


expense
 as
 a
 as
 a
 cost
 and
 save


themselves
 a
 bunch
 of
 money
 on
 taxes.
 So


no
 longer
 do
 you
 have
 to
 carry
 these


things
 on
 your
 balance
 sheet
 for
 the


next
 five
 years.
 The
 amount
 of
 income


that
 Meta
 generates
 is
 insane.
 So
 they


can
 expense
 that
 that
 that
 right
 away


and
 take
 the
 benefit
 of
 that
 cash
 flow


and
 they
 can
 stay
 liquid
 the
 entire


time.
 And
 at
 the
 same
 time
 because
 they


can
 stay
 liquid,
 they
 can
 keep
 doing


share
 buybacks,
 they
 can
 keep
 doing


dividends.
 Yep.


>> And
 and
 also
 remember
 the
 cost
 for
 them


for
 buybacks
 is
 I
 mean
 the
 ROIC
 on


buybacks
 is
 way
 better
 than
 locking
 that


away
 in
 some
 capital.
 That's
 why
 if
 you


look
 at
 all
 these
 all
 of
 these
 major


companies,
 why
 don't
 they
 just
 go
 out


there
 and
 build
 their
 own
 buildings
 and


and
 and
 not
 pay
 rent
 to
 landlords?
 Well,


that's
 because
 that's
 such
 a
 low
 margin


part
 of
 their
 business
 that
 they
 they


would
 rather
 be
 paying
 some
 leasing


charges
 and
 keep
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 money


and
 invest
 back
 into
 the
 business.


Right.
 Right.
 So,
 I
 think
 that's
 the


challenge
 that
 a
 lot
 not
 I
 want
 to
 say


challenge,
 but
 that's
 like
 the
 thing


that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 don't
 necessarily


realize
 that
 the
 ROIC
 that
 Meta
 is


getting
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 their
 um
 AI
 spend
 is


massive.
 Dude,
 I'm
 telling
 you,
 look
 at


their
 operating
 cash
 flow.
 two
 and
 a


half
 years
 they
 were
 able
 to
 take
 50


billion
 in
 operating
 cash
 flow
 to
 107


billion
 in
 operating
 cash
 flow
 and
 then


in
 another
 two
 years
 that
 thing
 right


now
 the
 projections
 are
 they're
 going
 to


do
 1.5


1
 point
 like
 150
 billion
 in
 operating


cash
 flow
 you
 tell
 me
 what
 the
 value
 of


a
 business
 is
 with
 150
 billion
 in
 obscat


operating
 cash
 flow
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time


their
 capex
 while
 they're
 investing
 a


ton
 of
 it
 right
 know,
 IT'S
 GOING
 TO


MODERATE
 EVENTUALLY
 and
 get
 back
 to
 a


normal
 normal
 level.


>> No,
 I
 agree
 and
 it
 really
 does
 feel
 like


the
 narrative
 uh
 sort
 of
 issue
 with


Google.
 They
 had
 a
 DOJ
 issue,
 but
 again,


the
 market
 was
 discounting
 them
 so


heavily
 over
 something
 that
 was
 so


external
 and
 it
 feels
 like
 that's
 the


same
 thing
 with
 Meta
 in
 terms
 of
 this
 AI


narrative.
 That's,
 you
 know,
 where
 is


the
 ROI
 coming
 from?
 To
 your
 point,


offering
 income
 doubling
 means
 the
 ROI


is
 there.
 By
 the
 way,
 guys,
 Netflix


reportedly
 is
 offering
 Warner
 Brothers


uh
 85%
 cash
 for
 the
 deal.
 That
 news
 just


broke
 which
 is
 pretty
 massive.
 So
 the


bid
 that
 they
 are
 submitting
 to
 Warner


Brothers
 85%
 of
 that
 is
 cash.
 Netflix


stock
 is
 down
 1%
 because
 the
 street


doesn't
 love
 it.
 But
 that
 is
 the


headline.
 Chris,
 last
 question
 for
 you.


I
 think
 this
 is
 the
 thing
 that


everyone's
 really
 wondering
 about
 in
 the


chat
 which
 is,
 you
 know,
 we
 talked
 about


Dr.
 Miller
 risk
 management.
 I
 mean
 look,


you're
 going
 to
 be
 up
 a
 lot
 today.
 The


options
 are
 going
 to
 print.
 Um
 you
 like


to
 couple
 your
 long
 calls
 with
 short


calls.
 You're
 probably
 feeling
 a
 lot
 of


excitement
 right
 now.
 How
 are
 you
 as
 a


manager
 of
 your
 portfolio
 thinking
 of


either
 profit
 taking
 short
 calls,


spreads,
 or
 do
 you
 really
 just
 think
 no,


you
 let
 this
 play
 out
 for
 the
 next
 two


years?


>> No,
 I'm
 gonna
 Well,
 here's
 the
 thing.
 At


some
 point,
 things
 are
 going
 to
 get


overbought.
 The
 market
 has
 a
 way
 of


overselling
 things
 and
 then
 there
 the


market
 has
 a
 way
 of
 over
 buying
 things,


right?
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 wait
 until
 this


thing
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 overbought
 and


then
 I'll
 sell
 some
 calls
 at
 the
 um
 at


the
 high
 end
 so
 that
 this
 way
 I
 do


create
 a
 spread
 and
 then
 I
 can
 use
 that


liquidity
 for
 other
 things
 that
 I


believe
 have
 recovery
 potential.
 You


know,
 like
 this
 was
 the
 same
 thing
 that


I
 did
 last
 year
 with
 Google.
 You
 know,


anyone
 who's
 been
 on
 my
 Patreon
 and


stuff,
 y'all
 yall
 know
 how
 bullish
 I
 was


about
 Google.
 So,
 my
 Google
 position
 is


doing
 extremely
 well.
 Now,
 no.
 Now,


that's
 not
 to
 say
 that,
 you
 know,
 I'm


not
 doing
 bad
 on
 some
 of
 the
 other


portions
 of
 my
 portfolio.
 Like,
 there


are
 a
 couple
 of
 companies
 that,
 you


know,
 haven't
 done
 the
 greatest,
 but
 at


the
 same
 time,
 in
 in
 terms
 of
 total


riskadjusted
 returns,
 I'm
 exceptionally


doing
 really
 well.
 So,
 I
 have
 my
 way
 of


when
 I
 see
 some
 fat
 pitches,
 I
 will


swing
 at
 them
 and
 sometimes
 they
 really


work
 out
 well
 and
 sometimes,
 you
 know,


hey,
 listen,
 they
 don't.
 Like,


>> but
 this
 is
 also
 this
 is
 also
 the
 beauty


of
 the
 markets,
 right?
 You
 deserve
 it
 if


you
 win,


>> but
 you
 can't
 cry
 if
 you
 lose.
 And
 that


is
 what
 makes
 the
 stock
 market
 so


special.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 I'll
 tell
 you
 the


positions
 that
 I'm
 not
 doing
 so
 well.


And
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 shares
 in
 next


decade.
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 position
 venture


global.
 I
 have
 uh
 spreads
 on
 um
 Fiserve


which
 started
 to
 recover
 yesterday
 with


all
 these
 insider
 buying.
 I
 took
 some


profits
 on
 Carnival
 Cruise
 Lines
 which


did
 well.
 I
 have
 a
 position
 in
 that
 I


literally
 4xed
 on
 Norwegian
 cruise
 lines


and
 then
 this
 pullback
 on
 Norwegian
 has


basically
 evaporated
 all
 of
 those
 gains.


But
 I
 haven't
 sold
 a
 single
 one
 one
 of


those
 spreads
 because
 I'm
 like
 look,
 I'm


looking
 at
 the
 future.
 I'm
 seeing
 what's


out
 there.
 So,
 you
 know,
 everyone's
 got


everyone's
 going
 to
 have
 their
 their


losers
 and
 everyone's
 going
 to
 have


their
 winners.
 And
 sometimes,
 you
 know,


as
 long
 as
 you
 understand
 when
 things,


especially
 a
 high
 quality
 business,
 goes


on
 sale,
 that's
 the
 that's
 the
 one
 time


you
 shouldn't
 be
 afraid
 to
 kind
 of
 dig


deep
 and
 and,
 you
 know,
 and
 buy
 stuff.
 I


mean,
 like
 I
 said,
 everyone's
 got
 to


develop
 their
 own
 conviction.
 Everyone's


got
 to
 develop
 their
 own
 thesis.
 And


sometimes
 those
 thesises,
 they
 can
 play


out
 well,
 and
 sometimes
 they
 don't.
 And


for
 me,
 today
 is
 my
 is
 a
 good
 day
 for


me.
 And
 I've
 had
 plenty
 of
 bad
 days.
 So,


I
 can't
 say
 uh
 I
 can't
 say
 um
 there's


that
 thing
 called
 that
 uh
 that
 um
 that


every
 day
 is
 a
 good
 day.
 I've
 never
 met


an
 investor
 that
 has
 nothing
 but


positive
 returns,
 you
 know.


>> I
 love
 it.
 Chris
 Mattail,
 thank
 you
 so


much.
 Thanks
 for
 tuning
 in
 and
 uh
 for


top
 or
 hopping
 in
 and
 explaining
 this


position.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 wanted
 some


analysis
 on
 how
 you're
 thinking
 of
 this


meta
 position.
 I'm
 sure
 a
 lot
 of
 people


got
 into
 Meta
 because
 they
 heard
 how


bullish
 you
 were.
 So,
 super
 super
 cool


stuff.
 Congrats.


>> I
 did
 that
 last
 year
 with
 Google,
 too.
 I


was
 I
 got
 to
 the
 point
 where
 people
 were


just
 getting
 mad
 at
 me.
 They're
 like,


"Stop
 posting
 [ __ ]
 about
 Google,
 dude.


We
 get
 it.
 You're
 bullish
 on
 Google."


And
 I
 was
 like,
 "When
 I
 see
 something


really
 really
 opportunistic
 in
 the


market,
 I
 I
 really
 do
 do
 a
 lot
 more


fundamental
 research."
 And
 and
 hopefully


it
 does
 pay
 off
 now
 in
 the
 short
 to


medium
 term.
 Listen,
 sometimes
 you
 gota


you
 got
 to
 deal
 with
 that
 [ __ ]
 pain


for
 like
 sometimes
 six
 months,
 a
 year,


maybe
 even
 two
 years.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 got
 to


give
 you
 and
 all
 the
 Palunteer
 people
 a


ton
 of
 credit
 because
 y'all
 helped


through
 some
 of
 the
 most
 difficult
 parts


of
 being
 an
 investor
 and
 that's
 why
 you


guys
 are
 being
 richly
 rewarded
 right


now,
 you
 know.
 So,
 like
 I
 said,
 if
 you


have
 the
 conviction,
 stick
 to
 it,
 stay


in
 it,
 you
 know,
 and
 and
 and
 do
 well
 in


the
 markets.
 And
 that's
 all
 I
 could
 hope


for
 for
 everyone.


>> But,
 but
 it's
 also
 really
 cool.
 I
 just


want
 to
 acknowledge
 as
 a
 community
 to


experience
 this
 type
 of
 stuff
 because
 I


think
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 this
 community


has
 been
 so
 special
 and
 that
 people
 tune


into
 the
 show
 every
 day
 is
 because
 like


a
 hedge
 fund
 manager
 that
 went
 long
 meta


that
 gets
 to
 go
 on
 Bloomberg
 and
 CNBC


and
 brag
 about
 it.
 That's
 like
 the


professional
 elite
 world.
 You're
 just
 a


regular
 dude
 who
 works
 a
 nineto-five


that
 does
 research
 at
 night
 and
 then
 you


open
 source
 that
 research
 the
 whole


community
 when
 the
 stock
 was
 trading
 $80


cheaper
 and
 people
 could
 either
 agree


with
 you
 or
 disagree
 with
 you
 but
 now


they're
 seeing
 the
 thesis
 come
 to
 light


and
 you
 know
 we
 get
 to
 see
 it
 happen


from
 from
 our
 from
 one
 of
 our
 own
 inside


of
 our
 own
 community
 and
 I
 think
 that's


just
 really
 cool
 and
 hopefully
 we
 can


keep
 seeing
 that
 over
 the
 next
 decade.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 like
 I
 said
 this
 is
 this


is
 just
 how
 the
 market
 is.
 The
 one
 thing


I
 will
 say
 that
 I
 I
 think
 all
 of
 us


really
 do
 appreciate
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 you
 started
 doing
 and
 I've
 been


doing
 more
 um
 is
 doing
 a
 lot
 more


technical
 analysis
 on
 entries.
 I've


always
 been
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 a
 fundamental


investor
 where
 I'll
 look
 at
 a
 company


and
 say,
 "Oh,
 no.
 Fundamentally,
 this
 is


oversold
 or
 over,
 you
 know,
 I
 mean,
 um,


this
 company
 is
 doing
 extremely
 well


fundamentally,
 but
 I've
 never


necessarily
 in
 the
 past
 looked
 at


technical
 analysis
 as
 a
 as
 a
 way
 to


really
 like
 juice
 up
 my
 my
 risk
 or,
 you


know,
 or
 drisk."
 But
 I
 think
 I'm


utilizing
 that
 concept
 more
 now,
 ever


since
 you
 started
 doing
 the
 thing
 with


Jason
 where
 I
 would
 be
 like, "Okay,
 you


know
 what?
 I
 I
 kind
 of
 understand
 it.
 I


really
 take
 a
 lot
 more
 technical


analysis
 at
 least
 to
 the
 degree
 where
 I


I
 want
 to
 get
 better
 entries.
 Yes.


Rather
 than
 just
 fundamentally
 getting


into
 a
 company
 like
 I'll
 give
 you
 an


example
 like
 I
 got
 into
 FERve
 when
 it


was
 crashing
 at
 75
 because
 the
 value
 is


really
 strong
 but
 I
 I
 think
 I
 bought
 a


little
 bit
 too
 soon.
 I
 should
 have


waited
 until
 it
 bottomed
 a
 little
 bit.
 I


saw
 some
 recovery
 on
 the
 MACD,
 but
 you


know,
 sometimes
 sometimes
 you
 can't
 nail


every
 single
 bottom,
 but
 with
 good


technical
 analysis,
 you
 can
 get
 pretty


damn
 close.
 So,
 like
 I
 said,
 I'm


incorporating
 more
 technical
 analysis


into
 my
 um
 into
 my
 entries
 and
 even
 some


of
 my
 exits
 as
 well.


>> I
 love
 it,
 Chris.
 Thank
 you.
 We'll
 talk


to
 you
 later.


>> Take
 care.
 Have
 a
 good
 one.


>> Later.


>> All
 right,
 we
 got
 three
 minutes
 until


this
 market
 opens.
 Again,
 the
 big


headlines
 of
 the
 day.
 Palenteer


partnering
 with
 Nvidia
 to
 launch
 a
 brand


new
 product
 called
 chain
 reaction
 to
 be


the
 deacto
 operating
 system
 for
 AI


infrastructure
 aka
 data
 centers.
 Uh
 then


you
 had
 Meta
 with
 this
 not
 announcement


but
 Bloomberg
 report
 that
 Zux
 is
 going


to
 pull
 back
 spending
 on
 the
 metaverse


by
 about
 30%.
 And
 then
 yesterday
 uh
 we


also
 had
 a
 pretty
 big
 announcement
 with


Jensen
 on
 the
 Joe
 Rogan
 podcast.
 So,
 it


was
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 the
 first
 time


Jensen's
 been
 on
 the
 podcast.
 Massive


massive
 deal.
 Lots
 of
 clips
 going
 viral


from
 this.
 The
 the
 news
 of
 last
 night


for
 Nvidia
 is
 that
 uh
 Trump
 is
 thinking


of
 getting
 H200's
 shipped
 to
 China.
 Now,


we've
 been
 talking
 about
 this
 headline


for
 a
 long
 time.
 The
 problem
 is
 Jensen


came
 out
 or
 at least
 some
 reports
 came


out
 this
 morning
 saying
 that
 Jensen
 um


basically
 is
 saying
 he
 doesn't
 even
 know


if
 China
 wants
 the
 H200
 chips
 and


China's
 been
 very
 explicit
 that
 they


want
 the
 latest
 quality
 chips.
 There's


people
 in
 the
 White
 House
 like
 Marco


Rubio
 that
 really
 don't
 want
 to
 sell


chips
 into
 China.
 Then
 you
 got
 Trump,


you
 know,
 realizing,
 hey,
 the
 American


economy
 kind
 of
 needs
 to
 like
 thrive
 and


Nvidia
 needs
 to
 do
 well.
 So
 maybe
 we


have
 to
 allow.
 So
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 nuance
 between
 what's
 happening
 with


China.
 Regardless
 of
 if
 Nvidia
 gets


China
 or
 not,
 their
 revenues
 are
 on


track
 to
 beat
 expectations
 again
 based


on
 what
 uh
 Colette,
 the
 CFO
 said
 at
 the


UBS
 conference
 yesterday.
 So
 I
 think


Nvidia
 will
 be
 okay
 without
 it.
 I
 did


buy
 more
 Nvidia
 yesterday
 at
 180.
 Uh


again,
 the
 simple
 argument.


Realistically,
 I
 looked
 at
 you
 the


market.
 It
 was
 like
 220.
 It
 was
 like,


you
 know,
 a
 couple
 hours
 before
 the


market
 closed
 and
 like
 Amcor
 was


pumping,
 which
 is
 an
 Nvidia
 derivative.


Nebus,
 which
 was
 an
 Nvidia
 derivative,


was
 pumping.
 Like
 things,
 we
 had
 a
 green


day
 and
 Nvidia
 was
 red.
 And
 I'm
 like,


this
 cannot
 go
 on
 for
 longer.
 This
 does


not
 make
 any
 sense
 to
 me.
 So,
 I
 think


Nvidia
 will
 continue
 to
 thrive.
 Nvidia


right
 there
 up
 1.24%
 probably
 pumping


because
 of
 Meta
 that
 will
 likely
 spend


more
 capex


uh
 on
 Nvidia.
 So,
 congratulations
 if


you're
 in
 Meta.
 Jobless
 claims
 this


morning
 were
 pretty
 good.
 Didn't
 have


that
 horrible
 of
 jobs
 data.
 We
 don't


have
 any
 other
 macro
 data
 at least
 that


I
 see.
 We
 might
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 later,


but
 nothing
 right
 now.
 And
 the


poundervidia
 partnership,
 a
 very
 big


deal.
 And
 then
 you
 got
 this
 meta
 news


that
 was
 super
 super
 important
 for
 meta


investors.
 That
 stock
 is
 up
 5%.
 Now
 we


got
 to
 see
 if
 it
 holds.
 This
 is
 the


beauty
 of
 the
 stock
 market.
 Sometimes


you're
 happy
 and
 then
 that
 happiness


gets
 stripped
 away.
 Maybe
 that
 happiness


gets
 even
 better.
 But
 we
 are
 going
 to


see
 as
 the
 market
 opens.
 It
 is
 Thursday,


December
 4th,
 9:30
 a.m.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 The
 stock


market
 is
 now
 open.


All
 right,
 wake
 your
 ass
 up.
 Let's
 get


into
 it.
 Meta
 670
 on
 the
 open.
 That's
 up


4.8%.
 It
 did
 get
 to
 687
 in
 the


pre-market.
 So,
 I
 think
 even
 holding
 a


4%
 move
 would
 be
 pretty
 exciting
 for


Meta.
 That
 stock
 is
 now
 up
 about
 4.9%
 on


the
 day.
 Amcor
 down
 about
 2%.
 Makes


sense.
 The
 stock
 was
 up
 almost
 9%


yesterday.
 Probably
 going
 to
 take
 a


breather
 today.
 That
 stock
 right
 there


down
 about
 2%.
 Apple
 284,
 that's
 green.


Bit
 mine's
 down
 about
 1.5%.
 Tesla,
 the


by
 the
 way,
 the
 Fusaka
 upgrade
 happened


last
 night.
 ETH
 also
 pumped
 to
 like


3200,
 3250.
 Now
 it's
 back
 to
 3170.
 But


uh
 we
 did
 get
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 move
 based
 on


that
 upgrade.
 SPY
 is
 green
 685


up
 about
 0.17.
 Amazon's
 green
 232.
 Tesla


wow
 450.


Tesla
 making
 a
 move
 right
 there.
 Haven't


seen
 450
 in
 what
 feels
 like
 a
 month,


right?
 It's
 been
 a
 minute
 for
 Tesla.


450.
 Micro
 strategy
 that's
 down
 2%.
 Big


Bear
 AI
 is
 down.
 Macy's
 is
 down.
 Cipher


is
 down.
 Terowolf
 is
 down.
 The
 data


center
 plays.
 Nebus
 probably
 is
 down.


Nebus
 is
 basically
 flat.
 Iran,
 which
 was


up
 7%
 yesterday.
 Iran
 is
 now
 down
 3%.


Nvidia
 180
 up6.
 Meta
 663.
 All
 right,
 so


Meta's
 dumping
 from
 the
 high
 of
 687.


We're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 long
 this
 can


hold.
 Still
 up
 25
 bucks.
 It
 was
 up
 50


bucks.
 So
 in
 the
 pre-markets,
 if
 you


bought
 at
 687,
 maybe
 wasn't
 the
 best


buy.
 Uh,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 volume
 did
 come
 in


immediately
 when
 that
 news
 came
 out.
 665


on
 Meta.
 Duolingo,
 that's
 up
 1.3%.


Oracle,
 that's
 flat
 on
 the
 day.
 Celsius,


that's
 flat.
 Galaxy
 that
 is
 also
 flat.


on
 the
 day
 as
 we
 get
 into
 it.
 QQQ,
 the


NASDAQ,
 we
 are
 flat
 as
 well.
 Looks
 like


the
 market
 wants
 to
 go
 a
 bit
 red.
 I
 know


it's
 a
 minute
 since
 we
 open,
 but
 you
 are


seeing
 red
 candles
 across
 the
 board.


So,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 much
 this
 can


hold.
 Hoodie
 Vlad
 was
 on
 CNBC
 talking


about
 prediction
 markets
 earlier
 in
 the


show.
 Hood's
 also
 flat
 at
 13351.


Uh
 SoFi,
 are
 we
 getting
 hit
 on
 SoFi?
 So


is
 down
 1.5.


So's
 really
 been
 stuck
 at
 this
 uh
 six
 or


at
 this
 27
 to
 29
 level.
 App
 loving
 is


green.
 That
 stock
 is
 moving.
 Grab
 we
 are


red
 at
 522.
 That's
 down
 about
 half
 a


percent
 on
 grab.
 Volume
 has
 completely


died
 out
 on
 Grab.
 I
 mean
 we
 this
 stock


was
 doing
 you
 know
 30
 40
 million
 shares


a
 day.
 It's
 now
 doing
 like
 10
 15


million.
 So
 again,
 I
 think
 the


announcement
 for
 the
 go-to
 acquisition


that
 happens
 likely
 in
 December
 is
 what


really
 the
 street
 is
 waiting
 for.
 Until


then,
 the
 stock
 needs
 catalyst.
 And


right
 now,
 this
 there
 is
 no
 catalyst.


And
 so,
 it's
 one
 of
 those
 waiting
 games


where
 until
 you
 get
 that
 piece
 of
 news,


that's
 what's
 going
 to
 change
 it.
 But


that
 is
 the
 piece
 of
 news
 that
 I
 think


the
 street
 cares
 about.
 S&P
 685
 hoodie


goes
 green
 13465.
 Speaking
 of
 catalysts,


again,
 Hood
 prediction
 markets
 is


becoming
 a
 massive
 catalyst
 for
 the


company
 rerating
 the
 volatility
 of
 the


stock
 because
 if
 crypto
 goes
 down,
 but


prediction
 markets
 are
 up,
 that
 kind
 of


offsets
 some
 of
 the
 revenue
 as
 Vlad
 was


talking
 about
 this
 morning.
 13454
 on


Robin
 Hood.
 Palunteer
 is
 slightly
 red


17560.


Slightly
 red


17560


on
 the
 day.
 BMNR


is
 flat.
 No,
 down
 1%.
 which
 is
 not
 that


crazy
 because
 ETH
 is
 also
 down
 point4.


American
 Eagle
 that's
 flat.
 D-Wave
 had
 a


good
 day
 yesterday.
 It
 was
 up
 5%
 up


another
 1%
 right
 here.
 Uh
 Warner


Brothers
 again,
 Netflix.
 Dude,
 I'm


getting
 more
 interested
 in
 Netflix.
 I


haven't
 done
 enough
 fundamental
 work
 on


the
 company
 to
 think
 if
 it's
 a
 buy.
 If


anyone
 has
 any
 uh
 due
 diligence
 on


Netflix,
 feel
 free
 to
 send
 it
 to
 me.
 But


I
 really
 do
 think
 if
 they
 acquire
 Warner


Brothers,
 that's
 a
 lot
 of
 content
 and


that's
 really
 really
 valuable
 content.


Now,
 will
 the
 stock
 tank
 when
 they
 make


the
 acquisition
 if
 they're
 paying
 like


$30
 billion?
 Probably.
 But
 I
 feel
 like


that's
 the
 opportunity
 because
 I
 mean,


imagine
 watching
 Game
 of
 Thrones
 on


Netflix.
 Like,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people


that
 I
 think
 are
 going
 to
 subscribe
 for


that
 content.


It
 would
 be
 pretty
 pretty
 valuable.
 You


know,
 I
 should
 ask
 Joseph
 Carlson
 to


come
 on
 the
 show.
 You
 know,
 the
 only


podcast
 he's
 done
 in
 three
 years
 has
 was


with
 me
 back
 in
 2022.
 I
 should
 hit
 him


up
 and
 be
 like,
 "Dude,
 let's
 let's
 do
 a


stream.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 Netflix."
 So,


maybe
 we'll
 do
 that
 now.
 that.
 Now,
 now


Steve
 might
 not
 like
 that,
 but


[laughter]


we
 might
 have
 to
 still
 do
 it.
 Speaking


of
 Steve,
 Salesforce,
 look,
 Salesforce


had
 a
 good
 earnings,
 but
 the
 market
 just


hates
 the
 stock.
 The
 market
 just
 hates


this
 stock,
 dude.
 They
 had
 decent


earnings.
 It
 was
 not
 horrible.
 Uh,
 by


any
 sense
 of
 the
 imagination,
 Agent


Force
 is
 growing
 very
 well,
 but
 it


wasn't
 lights
 out.
 Oh
 my
 goodness,
 this


is
 the
 AI
 revolution
 for
 Salesforce.
 And


I
 think
 that
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 issue
 that


uh
 Salesforce
 is
 having
 right
 here.


Snowflake
 for
 some
 reason
 got
 destroyed.


Like
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 the
 stock
 is
 down


10%.
 I
 really
 don't.
 And
 I
 I'm
 not
 even


a
 Snowflake
 shareholder.
 Like
 I
 know


there
 was
 this
 rivalry
 between
 Pouncer


and
 Snowflake
 years
 ago,
 but
 now
 Pouncer


Snowflake
 work
 together.
 I
 just
 I
 I


don't
 like
 seeing
 these
 AI
 software


names
 get
 hit
 this
 bad
 because
 it
 makes


you
 wonder
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 AI


software
 ecosystem,
 right?
 You
 want
 the


market
 to
 be
 excited
 about
 that.
 So
 they


put
 up
 some
 really
 good
 numbers.
 I'm
 not


sure
 what
 the
 street
 is
 upset
 about


here,
 but
 the
 street
 is
 upset
 about


something.
 The
 Q's
 right
 there
 down


0.22.
 Pounder
 176.
 That's
 green.
 Netflix


103,
 that's
 down
 about
 1%.
 Salesforce


not
 catching
 bid.
 How
 about
 Path?
 Path


had
 their
 first
 profitable
 quarter
 in


history
 yesterday
 on
 a
 gap
 basis.
 Path


is
 up
 11%.


Congrats
 if
 you're
 in
 Path.
 That's
 up


11%


on
 the
 day


as
 that
 is
 green.
 Warner
 Brothers
 has
 a


lot
 of
 overlapping
 with
 Netflix
 in
 terms


of
 subscribers.
 That's
 fair.
 I
 mean,
 I


subscribe
 to
 both,


but
 I
 I
 do
 think
 in
 terms
 of
 net
 new


subscribers,
 Netflix
 would
 be
 able
 to


capture
 what,
 at
 least
 10
 million
 new


people,
 if
 not
 more.
 Does
 H
 how
 many
 how


many
 subscribers
 does
 HBO
 Max
 have?
 Do


they
 publicly
 disclose
 that?


128
 million
 across
 its
 services.
 I
 don't


think
 we
 have
 the
 specific
 for
 HBO
 Max


itself.
 Yeah,
 they're
 going
 to
 get
 a


decent
 chunk
 of
 that
 if
 they
 actually


make
 this
 acquisition.
 Apploving
 that's


up
 2%
 on
 the
 day.
 Amazon


goes
 red
 once
 again.
 The
 market,
 this
 is


one
 of
 those
 stocks
 where
 again
 I
 think


you
 buy
 and
 you
 hold
 for
 the
 next


decade.
 And
 I
 really
 do
 think
 next
 year


it
 has
 a
 breakout,
 but
 it's
 Amazon
 and


Amazon's
 price
 action
 has
 been


horrendous.
 But
 nonetheless,


it's
 a
 sleep
 well
 at
 night
 type
 of


stock,
 but
 it's
 not
 a
 stock
 that's
 going


to
 move
 seven
 or
 eight%
 up
 or
 down
 every


day.
 Robin
 right
 there,
 135
 highs
 of


days
 on
 Robin.
 Warner
 Brothers
 does
 have


a
 lot of
 debt,
 and
 that's
 why
 I
 think


the
 street's
 upset
 about
 this
 and
 that's


why
 they're
 selling
 off
 Netflix.
 So,
 and


and
 that's
 why,
 you
 know,
 I
 struggle
 to


even
 think
 of
 buying
 the
 Netflix
 dip


until
 I
 do
 some
 analysis
 on
 that
 debt


and
 figure
 out
 how
 is
 Netflix
 planning


to
 manage
 that.
 Now
 rates
 are
 coming


down
 which
 is
 net
 bullish
 for
 companies


that
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 debt
 because
 they
 can


refinance
 it
 but
 still
 it
 is
 a
 bit


confusing.


Good
 morning
 sir
 you
 are
 live
 on
 the


market
 open.


>> Good
 morning
 Emid.
 How
 are
 you?


>> I
 am
 doing
 good.
 We
 were
 just
 talking


about
 you
 as


>> you
 know
 I
 just
 got
 a
 phone
 call
 from


Tanner.


>> Okay.


>> I
 just
 you
 know
 I
 just
 got
 my
 coffee.


He's
 like
 did
 you
 see
 the
 news?
 And
 I'm


like
 no
 I
 did
 not
 see
 the
 news.
 What


happens?


>> Do
 you
 know
 what
 I'm
 talking
 about?


>> I
 think
 you're
 talking
 about
 the


Palentry
 Nvidia
 partnership.


>> No,
 I
 am
 talking
 about
 Meta
 reducing


their
 capback
 spend
 on
 the
 metaverse.


>> Oh,
 of
 course.
 How
 could
 How
 could
 I
 not


know
 that?
 That's
 what
 Well,
 we
 just
 had


Chris
 on
 the
 show
 for
 about
 20
 minutes


explaining
 that.
 What
 is
 your
 take
 as


someone
 who
 has
 held
 Meta
 for
 a
 long


time
 and
 me
 and
 Chris
 were
 talking
 about


you
 because
 we
 mentioned
 someone
 did
 say


that
 if
 uh
 if
 Meta
 cuts
 their
 workforce


on
 the
 metaverse
 that
 stock's
 going
 to


be
 up
 the
 next
 one.


>> I
 said
 it
 last
 night.
 Tanner's
 like,


"How
 the
 hell
 did
 you
 know
 that
 that
 was


going
 to
 happen?"
 I
 said,
 "I
 didn't
 know


it
 was
 going
 to
 happen."
 I
 just
 said


that
 if
 it
 does
 happen,
 and
 it
 should


happen,
 this
 stock
 is
 going
 to
 explode.


And
 I
 think
 I
 said
 it
 on
 Wednesday
 uh


Tuesday
 night
 with
 you
 also.


>> We
 honestly
 you've
 been
 saying
 it
 for


like
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks
 because
 we've


been
 talking
 about
 meta
 a
 lot.


>> I
 I
 have
 been
 saying
 it
 for
 a
 lot
 long


time.


>> Fear
 and
 greed
 by
 the
 way
 at
 37.
 Okay.


So
 Meta's
 up
 5%
 right
 here.
 I
 guess
 the


question
 is
 do
 you
 think
 this
 is
 the


right
 move
 and
 do
 you
 think
 they're


going
 to
 take
 that
 metaverse
 spend
 and


put
 it
 into
 more
 capex?


>> I
 think
 it's
 the
 right
 move.
 I
 need
 to


look
 into
 what
 exactly
 they're
 cutting


and
 just
 like
 you
 said,
 where
 are
 they


putting
 the
 money?


>> Right.


>> So,
 if
 they're
 gonna
 say,
 you
 know
 what,


Reality
 Labs
 isn't
 working
 and
 it's
 more


of
 a
 time
 delay
 or
 an
 engineering
 thing.


We
 don't
 need
 just
 to
 keep
 throwing


money
 at
 it.
 We
 just
 need
 to
 refine
 it.


That's
 great


because
 that
 means
 that
 they
 can
 maybe


even
 cut
 down
 more
 in
 the
 future.
 And


that's
 the
 big
 loss
 leader
 on
 on
 the
 uh


negative
 operating
 income.


>> Correct.


>> So
 yeah,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 big.


>> Do
 you
 think
 the
 street
 So
 the
 stock
 was


at
 687,
 now
 it's
 at
 667.
 Do
 you
 think


the
 street's
 going
 to
 respect
 this
 move


enough
 to
 hold
 the
 gains
 or
 you
 kind
 of


don't
 care
 because
 it's
 the
 right
 move


regardless
 of
 the
 stock?


>> Yeah.
 It's
 not
 about
 today.
 Think
 about


it
 like
 this.
 It's
 December
 3
 now.
 Okay.


So,
 we're
 only
 going
 to
 get
 a
 month
 out


of
 Q4
 that
 this
 hits
 the
 Reality
 Labs


line.
 This
 is
 big
 for
 2026
 because
 now


that
 loss
 leader
 on
 negative
 operating


income
 will
 shrink
 in
 Q1
 and
 Q2
 and
 it's


going
 to
 boost
 operating
 income.
 So,


even
 if
 capex
 then
 goes
 up,
 operate


that's
 not
 going
 to
 change
 operating


income.


>> Yeah.
 and
 operating
 income
 will
 get


better
 because
 not
 only
 is
 Meta


generating
 more
 of
 it,
 they're
 losing


less
 on
 Reality
 Labs.
 And
 since
 that
 is


shown
 in
 the
 deck
 and
 that
 is
 a
 big


number
 that
 people
 care
 about,
 it
 will


propel
 the
 stock
 out.


>> Yeah.
 And
 Nvidia
 right
 here
 pumping
 3%.


>> So
 what
 [laughter]
 the
 Palier
 thing?


>> Yeah,
 Paler
 essentially
 Pounder
 is


launching
 a
 an
 operating
 system
 for
 data


centers.
 It's
 actually
 really,
 really


cool.
 And
 they're


>> How
 much
 is
 pounder
 up?


>> Pounder's
 up
 1%.
 And
 Nvidia
 is
 the


founding
 partner
 on
 this
 partnership
 as


well.
 So,
 all right.


>> Quick
 question
 for
 you,
 Steve,
 and
 then


I'll
 let
 you
 go.
 Uh,
 Salesforce
 stocks


flat.
 What
 was
 your
 reaction
 to
 those


earnings?


>> They
 crushed
 earnings.
 I
 I
 don't
 care


that
 the
 revenue
 was
 in
 line
 with


estimates.
 They're
 a
 $40
 billion
 company


that
 freaking
 grew
 their
 revenue
 by
 9%.


Their
 EPS
 smashed.
 They
 bought
 back
 more


shares
 than
 ever
 in
 this
 quarter.
 And


the
 big
 thing
 was
 Asian
 Force
 number.
 It


was
 and
 I
 don't
 have
 the
 report
 in
 front


of
 me
 and
 I'm
 still
 half
 asleep,
 but
 the


ingestion
 was
 like
 3.2
 trillion
 records


or
 some
 ridiculous
 number
 this
 quarter,


right,
 for
 Asian
 Force.


>> And
 their
 Asian
 Force
 deals
 grew.
 Half


of
 them
 are
 paid.
 And
 nobody
 can
 say


they're
 not
 a
 player
 in
 AI.
 All
 the


people
 that
 say
 it's
 a
 shitty
 product


and
 they
 hate
 the
 product,
 they're
 not


the
 decision
 makers
 about
 are
 we
 getting


rid
 of
 Salesforce
 or
 not,
 but
 their


opinion
 doesn't
 matter.
 And
 Salesforce


is
 tied
 to
 too
 many
 organizations.


Nobody's
 getting
 rid
 of
 it.
 They're


still
 growing.
 They're
 on
 track
 to
 do
 13


billion
 in
 free
 cash
 flow.
 And
 it
 is
 one


of the
 most
 undervalued
 tech
 companies


there
 is.
 And
 next
 year
 it
 could
 be
 a


catchup
 theme
 in
 AI
 because
 of
 how
 big


Agent
 Force
 is
 getting.
 So
 I
 like
 to
 go


against
 the
 grain
 sometimes.
 This
 is
 the


dark
 horse
 at
 26.


>> All right.
 I
 love
 it.
 Thank
 you,
 Steve.


Appreciate
 you
 calling
 in.


>> All
 right.
 Are
 you
 uh
 All right.
 Have


fun
 later.


>> Yeah.
 Talk
 later.


>> Later.
 Bye.


UPS
 down
 2%.
 Why
 is
 UPS
 down?
 Because


Amazon,
 according
 to
 the
 Washington


Post,
 uh,
 is
 going
 to
 be
 cutting
 ties


with,
 well,
 actually,
 they're
 cutting


ties
 with
 USPS,
 but
 I
 guess
 UPS
 is


falling
 in
 sympathy
 because
 Amazon
 might


end
 up
 starting
 to
 take
 away
 some


business
 from
 them
 as
 well.
 Uh,
 that


would
 strip
 the
 Postal
 Service
 of
 more


than
 six
 billion
 a
 year
 in
 revenue,


roughly
 7.5%


of
 their
 total.


Okay.
 So,
 you
 are
 getting
 uh
 a
 bit
 of


these
 if
 FedEx
 is
 down
 as
 well.
 That


could
 be
 correlated
 to
 that.
 Amazon


again,
 they're
 going to
 be
 vertically


integr.
 I
 really
 do
 think
 Amazon
 Yeah,


you
 FedEx
 h
 it's
 down
 a
 little.
 It
 was


down
 and
 recovered
 a
 little
 bit.
 I
 think


Amazon's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 one
 in
 2026.


I
 don't know
 if
 the
 stock's
 going
 to


make
 a
 massive
 move,
 but
 I
 just
 think


it's
 not
 going
 to
 have
 a
 3%
 year
 like


it's
 having
 this
 year.
 It's
 just
 more


and
 more
 vertical
 integration
 across


board.
 And
 Microsoft,
 that's
 flat
 on
 the


day.
 We
 did
 have
 that
 Microsoft
 fake


news
 yesterday
 about
 cutting
 uh
 sales


quotas
 on
 C-Pilot
 basically
 saying


co-pilot
 sucks.
 Market
 reacted
 but
 I


don't
 think
 the
 market
 cares
 that
 much


anymore.
 So
 Microsoft
 did
 deny
 that


report.
 PayPal
 that's
 down
 again.
 The


CFO
 at
 PayPal
 at
 a
 conference
 yesterday


said
 the
 consumer
 was
 weak
 in
 September,


October
 and
 November.
 So
 once
 again


citing
 a
 weak
 consumer.
 Google
 right


there
 that's
 down
 about
 1.2%.
 Nike


that's
 flat.
 Oscar
 down
 1%.
 UNH
 that's


down
 a
 little
 bit.
 And
 then
 Krauss
 down


about
 1.3%


as
 well.
 Micron's
 also
 getting
 hit


today.
 Micron
 down
 3%.
 Again,
 Micron
 is


up
 a
 lot
 for
 the
 year.
 So,
 some
 of
 these


names
 are
 just
 up
 a
 ton
 and
 people
 may


be
 taking


their
 profits.
 Oracle
 has
 earnings
 next


week.
 Rate
 cuts
 are
 good
 for
 their
 debt.


What
 are
 your
 thoughts?
 You
 know,
 Oracle


is
 very
 confusing
 to
 me
 simply
 because


Oracle
 up
 1%
 right
 here.
 I
 don't
 think


they
 deserve
 to
 be
 350,
 but
 I
 also
 don't


think
 they
 deserve
 to
 be
 below
 200.
 Uh,


are
 they
 going
 to
 increase
 their
 RPO


obligations?
 Are
 they
 going
 to
 have


another
 massive
 like
 AI
 deal
 that
 is


outside
 of
 OpenAI
 to
 really
 juice
 up


their
 numbers
 even
 though
 their
 debt
 is


increasing?
 Their
 credit
 default
 swaps


have
 hit
 an
 all-time
 high
 on
 price.
 I


think
 the
 market's
 just
 confused
 when


the
 revenue
 that
 they
 say
 is
 coming
 is


going to
 come
 and
 it
 might
 take
 a
 couple


years.
 Does
 that
 mean
 Oracle
 stays
 flat


till
 that
 revenue
 materializes
 or
 do


people
 frontr
 run
 it?
 I
 really
 don't


know.
 Rate
 cuts
 are
 good
 for
 their
 debt,


but
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 you
 know,


their
 debt
 is
 40
 billion.
 So
 the


street's
 more
 upset
 about
 just
 like
 the


velocity
 of
 debt
 they
 decided
 to
 deploy


for
 these
 data
 centers.
 And
 I
 think


they're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 say
 something


on
 that
 call
 that
 counteracts
 that


narrative
 and
 really
 just
 highlight
 the


ROI
 they're
 getting
 from
 all
 that
 debt.


Tesla
 right
 here.
 452.


Very
 very
 very
 exciting
 to
 see
 452
 on


Tesla.
 I'll
 show
 you
 guys
 this
 uh
 quick


video.
 We
 we
 we
 I
 showed
 you
 a
 little


bit
 yesterday
 of
 Tesla


and
 the
 robot
 uh
 as
 doing
 as
 well
 as
 it


did.
 So,
 this
 is
 the
 progress
 from
 May


of
 2023
 to
 today,
 June
 of
 or
 December
 of


2025.


As
 you
 can
 see,
 things
 have
 changed.


There's
 the
 robot
 literally
 running.
 But


not
 only
 is
 Tesla
 getting
 a
 robot
 to


run,
 here's
 Figures
 robot
 that
 responded


to
 this.


And
 look
 at
 that.
 their
 robot
 is
 also


uh
 in
 a
 position
 where
 it's
 trying
 to
 do


what
 Tesla's
 doing,
 which
 is
 basically


show
 that
 it
 can
 be
 fully
 functional.


I
 don't
 know
 why
 the
 video
 is
 not


loading,
 but
 if
 the
 video
 was
 loading,


then
 you
 would
 see
 the
 robot
 running


back
 and
 forth.
 So,
 again,
 the
 robot


wars
 are
 heating
 up.
 Uh
 the
 big


announcement
 yesterday
 was
 that
 uh
 the


the
 administration
 Lutnik
 said
 is


thinking
 of
 creating
 a
 robotic
 ZAR


essentially
 a
 Yeah,
 Twitter's
 just
 not


working.
 I'll
 see
 if
 I
 can
 pull
 it
 up
 on


my
 phone.
 Uh
 essentially
 someone
 who
 is


like
 an
 AI
 cryptozar
 before
 robotics
 and


I
 think
 that
 really
 is
 bullish
 for


Tesla.
 Uh
 bull
 for
 bullish
 for
 Amazon
 as


well.
 But
 if
 we
 are
 entering
 into
 the


age
 of
 robotics,
 uh,
 bullish
 for
 Nvidia


as
 well
 because
 those
 robots
 are
 going


to
 need
 chips,
 then
 you
 need
 an


administration
 that
 is
 tailored
 towards


focusing
 on
 policies
 that
 can
 help
 these


robots
 thrive.
 Just
 like
 as
 Chris
 was


talking
 about
 the
 zoning
 laws
 and
 the


expense
 laws
 for
 data
 centers
 that
 were


in
 the
 one
 big
 beautiful
 bill,
 you're


going to
 need
 something
 like
 that
 for


robotics
 and
 Tesla
 would
 be
 a
 core


beneficiary
 right
 there.
 Tesla
 up
 1.5%


on
 the
 day.
 Here's
 the
 video
 on
 my


phone.
 so
 you
 guys
 can
 see
 it.


But
 it
 does
 seem
 pretty
 pretty
 cool
 that


this
 is
 happening
 back
 and
 forth.


Um,
 so
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 there
 with


Tessie.
 S&P
 flat
 on
 the
 day.
 Where
 is


Meta?
 Is
 it
 holding
 the
 move?
 It's


holding
 3%.
 Not
 horrible.
 Holding
 3%.


Netflix
 still
 down.
 Bit
 mine's
 down
 1.5.


Pounder
 176.
 Grab
 at
 525.
 Robin
 Hood


13365.


Oscars
 down
 about
 1.2%.
 Beyond
 Meat's
 up


a
 little bit
 on
 the
 day.
 Door
 Dash
 down


1.69
 and
 then
 HIMS
 that
 stock
 up
 3%.


Rocket
 Lab
 had
 a
 major
 day
 yesterday


that
 was
 up
 7%.
 Rocket
 Lab
 continuing


that
 day
 2.24.


Nice
 to
 see
 that
 Rocket
 Lab
 and
 some
 of


the
 space
 names
 like
 AS


are
 also
 getting
 some
 love.
 AS
 up
 4%


here.
 Now
 the
 other
 piece
 of
 news
 that


came
 from
 the
 Financial
 Times
 yesterday,


which
 I
 think
 is
 a
 nothing
 burger,
 but


nonetheless
 it
 is
 news.
 Um,
 bond


investors
 are
 warning
 the
 US
 Treasury
 of


their
 fear
 of
 Hasset
 being
 the
 new
 Fed


chair.
 So,
 the
 argument
 here
 is
 that


they
 essentially
 think
 Hasset
 is
 way
 too


loyal
 to
 Trump
 and
 they
 would
 rather


have
 Rick
 Reer
 or
 Christopher
 Waller
 or


someone
 who's
 like
 dovish
 but
 not
 like,


you
 know,
 has
 just
 un
 unconditional


loyalty
 to
 Trump,
 which
 I
 mean,
 look,


Kevin
 Hasset's
 the
 national
 economic


director.
 Obviously,
 he
 wants
 to
 be
 in


the
 right
 position
 in
 alignment
 with
 the


administration.
 If
 he
 transitions
 to
 an


independent
 position,
 one
 could
 argue,


is
 he
 really
 independent,
 which
 is
 a


fair
 point,
 but
 then
 again,
 is
 any


position
 member
 ever
 independent?
 You


know,
 every
 political
 party
 gets
 to
 pick


their
 administration
 when
 they're
 in


power.
 And
 so,
 I
 think
 those
 are
 like


fears
 that
 are
 healthy,
 but
 I
 don't


think
 that's
 going
 to
 affect
 Trump's


decision
 on
 who
 becomes
 the
 next
 Fed


chair.
 Now,
 it's
 not
 a
 lock
 for
 Hasset


to
 become
 the
 next
 Fed
 chair,
 but
 I


don't
 know
 if
 that
 report
 in
 and
 of


itself
 is
 going
 to
 influence
 Trump
 to


think
 of
 a
 different
 fetch
 here.


Coreweave
 above
 60
 or
 above
 80.
 Corewave


getting
 some
 love.
 There
 you
 go.
 80.88.


How
 about
 Nebius?
 We
 are
 at


um
 9930.
 That
 goes
 green.
 And
 then
 I


still
 red
 for
 the
 day.
 By
 the
 way,


remember
 those
 remember
 those
 5x
 ETFs


that
 we
 talked
 about
 like
 a
 month
 ago


that
 this
 company
 was
 planning
 to
 do


like
 5x
 Nvidia,
 5x
 AMD,
 etc.
 Uh
 the
 SEC


apparently
 came
 out
 and
 they
 said,


"Yeah,
 maybe
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 allow


that."
 So,
 it's
 not
 confirmed
 yet.
 They


were
 supposed
 to
 go
 live
 December
 31st.


Um
 but
 the
 SEC,
 as
 you
 can
 see
 right


here,
 sent
 out
 a
 letter
 and
 they're


pushing
 back
 on
 the
 legitimacy
 of
 these


3x
 5x
 leveraged
 ETFs.


and
 they're
 accusing
 the
 company
 that


was
 putting
 them
 out
 as
 like
 basically


using
 a
 loophole
 that
 they
 can't


necessarily
 use
 to
 make
 this
 a
 real


thing.
 I
 actually
 think
 this
 is
 a
 good


idea.
 Uh
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 I
 think


a
 5x
 ETF
 is
 the
 quickest
 way
 to
 blow
 up


an
 account
 and
 there's
 already
 a
 lot
 of


ways
 to
 blow
 up
 accounts
 like
 zero
 DTE.


So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,
 it
 maybe
 it's


not
 the
 best
 idea
 in
 the
 world
 to
 allow


those
 things
 to
 easily
 be
 liquid.
 And
 I


also
 just
 think
 they're
 going to
 fail.


People
 forget
 the
 meme
 stock
 ETF
 that


came
 out
 in
 December
 of
 2021.
 It
 had
 to


shut
 down
 in
 December
 2023
 because
 we


had
 a
 bare
 market
 and
 they
 failed.


Eventually,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 times


where
 like
 the
 market's
 not
 going
 to
 the


moon.
 Even
 if
 it's
 not
 a
 bare
 market,
 if


it's
 stagnant,
 I
 mean,
 even
 in
 November,


[laughter]
 if
 you
 were
 in
 a
 in
 Rocket


Lab
 that
 went
 down
 30%,
 you
 were
 5x


leveraged.
 I
 mean,
 like
 you're
 done,


right?
 So,
 I
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 if
 those


ETFs
 will
 survive
 long
 term.
 So,
 maybe


it
 makes
 sense
 they
 don't
 officially
 get


approved.
 18245


on
 Nvidia


as
 that
 is
 going
 green
 on
 the
 day.


Rashil
 says
 I
 bought
 Nebus
 at
 30,
 sold


at
 50,
 now
 creating
 a
 position
 again,


starting
 at
 90.
 You
 know,
 stock
 talk.
 I


think
 this
 is
 one
 of the
 reasons
 a
 lot


of
 people
 liked
 uh
 his
 commentary


yesterday
 and
 uh
 he
 told
 me
 to
 tell
 you


guys
 that
 he
 loved
 being
 on
 the
 show
 and


he
 was
 super
 excited
 to
 to
 talk
 with
 all


you
 guys.
 Um,
 one
 of the
 things
 that
 he


talks
 about
 a
 lot
 is
 just
 when
 you
 have


a
 cost
 basis
 that
 is
 super
 low,
 being


able
 to
 defend
 that
 position,
 even
 if


you
 trim
 that
 position
 is
 very
 important


and
 not
 getting
 rid
 of
 the
 entire


position,
 which
 is
 something
 a
 lot
 of
 us


have
 have
 made
 a
 mistake
 on,
 right?
 You


buy
 low
 and
 then
 you
 sell
 high,
 but
 if


there's
 no
 real
 conviction,
 you
 don't


get
 the
 benefit
 of
 having
 a
 very
 low


cost
 basis
 to
 allow
 the
 position
 to


mature
 so
 that
 eventually
 if
 there's


pullbacks,
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 add
 on


those
 dips
 because
 those
 dips
 aren't


actually
 dips
 to
 you.
 are
 still


multiples
 above
 your
 original
 position.


So,
 I
 think
 with
 Nebius,
 a
 lot
 of
 people


definitely
 feel
 that
 given
 they
 bought


low,
 sold
 high.
 Um,
 obviously
 I
 got
 in


pretty
 late
 on
 Nebus,
 but
 nonetheless,
 I


do
 think
 the
 upside
 for
 that
 going
 into


next
 year
 is
 pretty
 strong,
 and
 that


should
 be
 a
 stock
 that
 plays
 out
 if
 the


data
 center
 thesis
 also
 continues
 to


play
 out.
 Google
 right
 there,
 316,


that's
 red.
 You're
 seeing
 the
 entire


market
 start
 to
 go
 red.
 There's
 pockets


of
 green,
 but
 most
 things
 are
 starting


to
 sell
 off
 a
 bit
 more.
 S&P.
 Yeah,
 S&P


goes
 red.
 683.


S&P


goes
 red
 right
 here.
 68322.


Do
 we
 have
 any
 other
 macro
 news
 coming


out
 in
 10
 minutes?
 We
 have
 the
 jobless


claims.
 Do
 we
 finally
 get
 jolts
 today?


Do
 we
 get
 jolts?
 We
 do
 not
 get
 jolts.


No.
 I
 think
 that's
 pretty
 much
 it.
 We


had
 jobless
 claims.
 We
 had
 the
 November


layoffs
 which
 was
 71,000
 the
 highest
 in


2025
 since
 the
 pandemic
 which
 means
 the


labor
 market
 probably
 is
 weakening


but
 that
 should
 be
 the
 data
 that
 we're


getting
 today.
 Um
 open
 AI
 bunch
 of


different
 headlines
 on
 these
 guy.
 Oh
 I


got
 to
 play
 this
 clip
 for
 you
 guys
 as


well
 from
 the
 anthropic
 CEO.
 I
 think
 he


had
 a
 really
 really
 good
 clip
 on
 what's


going
 on
 with
 data
 centers
 and
 the


investment
 that
 they're
 making
 and
 he's


subliminally
 calling
 out
 OpenAI
 without


actually
 calling
 them
 out.
 But
 uh
 there


was
 a
 couple
 announcements
 yesterday
 for


OpenAI.
 Number
 one
 is
 that
 apparently


Sam
 Alman
 wanted
 to
 build
 a
 SpaceX


competitor.
 And
 every
 time
 I
 see
 these


types
 of
 headlines,
 I
 just
 kind
 of
 feel


like
 he's
 getting
 desperate
 because
 like


really,
 you're
 going
 to
 compete
 with


SpaceX?
 I
 mean,
 that's
 not
 easy
 to
 do.


And
 you
 already
 have
 a
 hard
 enough
 job


proving
 to
 the
 world
 that
 OpenAI
 is
 not


a
 scam.
 And
 I
 don't
 mean
 to
 say
 that
 in


a
 negative
 way.
 It's
 just,
 hey,
 20


billion
 in
 revenue,
 1.4
 trillion
 in


spending.
 I
 mean,
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 prove


to
 make
 sure
 that
 OpenAI
 works
 out.
 And


now
 you
 want
 to
 build
 a
 rocket
 company


that
 has
 data
 centers
 in
 space.
 I
 mean,


like,
 you
 probably
 got
 to
 build
 the
 data


centers
 in
 Texas
 first
 and
 you
 got
 to


prove
 you
 have
 the
 money
 to
 build
 those


data
 centers
 because
 right
 now
 no
 one


knows
 where
 the
 hell
 the
 money
 is
 coming


from.
 So,
 I
 I
 do
 think
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of


random
 things
 happening
 with
 OpenAI.
 And


yeah,
 you
 had
 that
 whole
 co-read


controversy
 that
 came
 out
 over
 the
 past


couple
 days.
 They
 delayed
 their
 ads


product
 to
 be
 able
 to
 work
 on
 Gemini.


I
 just
 think
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


questions
 more
 than
 answers
 on
 Open
 Eye.


Here
 is
 Daario.
 He's
 honestly
 one
 of
 my


favorite
 uh
 LLM
 CEOs.
 I
 think
 the
 way


that
 he
 communicates
 about
 this
 stuff
 is


very
 well
 nuanced.
 Here's
 his
 response.


It's
 about
 a
 two
 to
 three
 minute


response
 around
 AI
 spending,
 how
 his


company
 is
 growing,
 and
 ultimately
 the


future
 for
 where
 he
 thinks
 the
 data


center
 space
 is
 going
 and
 how
 much


capacity
 is
 actually
 needed
 and
 how
 that


capacity
 meetes
 me
 uh
 matches
 the


revenue
 that
 these
 companies
 are
 trying


to
 spend.


>> Now,
 I
 mean,
 it
 really
 does
 represent


potentially
 almost
 all
 of
 the
 growth
 in


the
 United
 States
 GDP
 right
 now.


Literally.


that
 we
 are
 in
 some
 form
 of
 a
 bubble.


Are
 we
 overspending?
 Does
 the
 math
 of


all
 of
 this
 make
 sense?
 So,
 this
 is


really
 complicated
 and
 I
 want
 to


separate
 out
 the
 technological
 side
 of


it
 from
 the
 economic
 side
 of
 it.
 On
 the


technological
 side
 of
 it,
 I
 feel
 really


solid.
 I
 think
 I'm
 one
 of the
 most


bullish
 people
 around
 and
 I
 think
 it


pencils
 out.
 On
 the
 economic
 side,
 you


know,
 I
 I
 I
 have
 my
 concerns
 where
 even


if
 the
 technology
 is
 is,
 you
 know,


really
 powerful
 and
 fulfills
 all
 its


promises.
 I
 think
 there
 may
 be
 players


in
 the
 ecosystem
 who
 if
 they
 just
 make
 a


timing
 error,
 if
 they
 just
 get
 it
 off
 by


a
 little
 bit,
 bad
 things
 could
 happen.


So,
 let
 me
 go
 through
 both
 of
 them.
 On


the
 technological
 side,
 the
 the
 reason


that
 I'm
 not
 in
 honestly
 by
 the
 pure


technology,
 not
 that
 surprise
 is
 myself


and
 some
 of
 the
 people
 who
 eventually


became
 my
 my
 my
 co-founders,
 we
 were
 the


first
 to
 document
 the
 scaling
 laws
 of


AI,
 which
 is
 you
 put
 more
 compute,
 you


put
 more
 data
 into
 AI
 with
 small


modifications.
 We've
 seen
 these
 things


like
 reasoning
 models
 and
 test
 time


compute.
 They're
 all
 tiny
 little
 tweaks.


And
 I've
 been
 watching
 that
 trend
 for


the
 last
 12
 years
 or
 so
 since
 I
 joined


the
 field.
 And
 the
 thing
 that
 is
 most


striking
 about
 all
 of
 it
 is
 as
 you
 train


these
 models
 in
 this
 very
 simple
 way,


you
 know,
 with
 a
 few
 simple


modifications,
 they
 get
 better
 and


better
 at
 every
 task
 under
 the
 sun,
 they


get
 better
 at
 coding.
 They
 get
 better
 at


doing
 science.
 They
 get
 better
 at
 biio


medicine.
 They
 get
 better
 at
 the
 law.


They
 get
 better
 at
 finance.
 They
 get


better
 at
 at,
 you
 know,
 materials
 and


manufacturing.
 and
 and
 that's
 just


that's
 just
 a
 listing
 of
 all
 the
 sources


of
 e
 of
 of
 of
 value
 of
 value
 in
 our


economy.
 If
 I
 just
 take
 anthropic


itself,
 which
 because
 we
 work
 so
 much
 in


the
 enterprise
 side,
 I
 think
 we're
 a


good
 barometer,
 maybe
 a
 pure
 barometer


than
 the
 others,
 which
 kind
 of
 filter


through
 consumers,
 which
 kind
 of
 have


their
 habits
 and
 their
 use
 cases.
 We


look
 at
 our
 revenue,
 it's
 grown
 10x
 a


year
 every
 year
 for
 the
 last
 three


years.
 zero
 to
 100
 million
 in
 2023,
 100


million
 to
 a
 billion
 2024,
 one
 billion


to
 it's
 gonna
 land
 somewhere
 between


eight
 and
 10
 a
 at
 the
 right
 there
 as


well.
 I
 just
 want
 to
 highlight
 when


everyone
 says
 AI
 is
 a
 bubble.
 This
 guy


has
 10x
 the
 revenue
 of
 his
 AI
 company


every
 year
 for
 three
 years
 in
 a
 row.
 I


mean,
 again,
 I
 don't
 understand
 how
 you


can
 generate
 that
 type
 of
 growth
 if
 all


of
 it
 is
 fake.
 You
 can
 say
 some
 parts
 of


it
 are
 overvalued,
 but
 you
 cannot
 say


that
 it's
 fake.
 there's
 no
 use
 case
 and


that
 it's
 just
 not
 real.


>> The
 end
 of
 this
 year,
 will
 it
 continue?


I
 don't
 know.
 But
 the
 technology
 is


driving
 there
 and
 the
 economic
 value
 is


coming
 with
 it.
 I
 it
 will,
 you
 know,


that
 that
 trend
 is
 going
 to
 slow
 down


for
 sure,
 but
 it's
 still
 going
 to
 be


really
 fast.
 And
 so
 I
 have
 this


confidence
 that
 the
 the
 ulti
 eventually


the
 economic
 value
 is
 the
 e
 eventually


the
 economic
 value
 is
 going
 to
 be
 there.


Um,
 but
 when
 you
 But
 let's
 just
 go
 to


this
 because
 there
 are
 companies
 that


are
 spending
 hundred
 billion
 dollars
 a


year
 more.
 You're
 going
 to
 be
 spending


50.
 You
 look
 at
 what
 Sam
 Alman,
 who
 was


here
 last
 year,
 plans
 to
 be
 spending.


These
 are
 extraordinary
 numbers.
 And


this
 is
 all
 a
 bet,
 a
 big
 bet
 that
 this


is
 going
 to
 scale
 in
 this
 way.
 And
 and


my
 question
 is,
 is
 there
 a
 real
 way
 to


pencil
 this
 out
 or
 is
 this
 uh
 more
 of
 a


a
 gut
 feeling
 at
 this
 point?


>> So,
 let
 me
 let
 Yeah.
 So
 that
 really
 gets


to
 the
 second
 part
 of
 it
 and
 and
 I
 I
 I
 I


will
 describe
 as
 transparently
 as
 I
 can.


I
 think
 there's
 a
 real
 dilemma
 deriving


from
 uncertainty
 in
 how
 quickly
 the


economic
 value
 is
 going
 to
 grow
 and
 the


lag
 times
 on
 building
 the
 data
 centers


that
 that
 drives
 it.
 So
 I
 think
 there's


genuine
 uncertainty,
 there's
 genuine


dilemma
 which
 we
 as
 a
 company
 try
 to


manage
 as
 responsibly
 as
 we
 can.
 And


then
 I
 think
 there
 are
 some
 players
 who


you
 know
 who
 who
 are
 yoloing
 who
 who


pull
 pull
 the
 wrist
 dial
 too
 far
 and
 I'm


very
 concerned.


>> Who
 is
 yo
 aka
 open
 AI


>> yoloing?


>> So
 I
 that's
 a
 question
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


answer.
 Um
 uh
 uh
 so
 on
 the
 first
 one
 put


yourself


>> we'll
 come
 back
 to
 that.


>> Put
 yourself
 We
 won't
 put
 put
 yourself


in
 in
 the
 position
 of
 of
 entropic.
 Put


yourself
 in
 my
 position.
 you
 you you've


seen
 this
 revenue
 curve
 that
 goes
 up
 10x


a
 year
 for
 three
 years.
 You're
 like,


"Okay,
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 next


year?"
 If
 I'm
 really
 dumb
 and
 I


extrapolate
 the
 pattern
 10
 to
 100


billion.
 I
 don't
 believe
 that.
 Just
 to


be
 clear,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 believe
 that


at
 all.
 Even
 though
 it's
 happened
 in
 the


last
 three
 years
 just
 at
 this
 scale,
 I


don't
 believe
 it.
 But
 that's
 one
 of the


outer
 bounds
 of,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 outer


limits
 of
 possibility.
 If
 I
 go
 in
 and


I'm
 like
 this
 enterprise
 and
 that


enterprise
 and
 this
 use
 case
 and
 this
 is


our
 go
 to
 market
 motion.
 If
 I
 try
 and
 do


it
 you
 know
 bottom
 up
 then
 you
 know


maybe
 it's
 maybe
 it's
 20
 or
 30
 or


something
 like
 that.
 So
 there
 is
 what


what
 I've
 been
 calling
 internally
 this


cone
 of
 uncertainty
 where
 I
 don't
 know


if
 a
 year
 from
 now
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 20


billion
 or
 you
 know
 it's
 it's
 going
 to


be
 50
 or
 or
 like
 you
 know
 it's
 it's
 it's


very
 uncertain.
 I
 try
 to
 plan
 in
 a


conservative
 way.
 So
 I
 plan
 for
 the


lower
 side
 of
 it.
 But
 but
 that
 is
 very


disconcerting.
 And
 you
 add
 to
 that
 the


idea
 that


building
 the
 data
 centers
 has
 a
 long
 lag


time.
 It's
 like
 a
 year
 or
 two.
 So
 I
 have


to
 decide
 now,
 literally
 now
 or
 in
 some


cases
 a
 few
 months
 ago,
 how
 how
 much


compute
 I
 need
 to
 buy
 in,
 you
 know,


early
 20
 for
 to
 serve
 the
 models
 in


early
 2027
 when
 I
 get
 to
 that
 revenue


amount.
 And
 there's
 two
 coupled
 dangers.


One
 is
 that
 if
 I
 if
 I
 don't
 buy
 enough


compute,
 I
 won't
 be
 able
 to
 serve
 all


the
 customers
 I
 want.
 I'll
 have
 to
 turn


them
 away
 and
 send
 them
 to
 to to
 my


competitors.
 If
 I
 buy
 too
 much
 compute,


of
 course,
 I
 might
 not
 get
 enough


revenue
 to
 pay
 for
 that
 compute.
 And
 and


and
 you
 know,
 and
 and
 you
 know,
 in
 the


extreme
 case,
 there's
 kind
 of
 the
 risk


of
 going
 bankrupt.
 And
 how
 how
 much


buffer
 there
 is
 in
 that
 in
 that
 cone.
 Um


it's
 basically
 determined
 by
 my
 margins.


If
 I
 have
 80%
 margins,
 I
 can
 buy
 $20


billion
 of
 compute
 and
 it
 could
 serve


hundred
 billion
 dollar
 hundred
 billion


dollars
 of
 revenue.
 But
 because
 the
 cone


is
 so
 wide,
 it's
 hard
 to
 avoid,
 you


know,
 making
 a
 mistake
 on
 on
 one
 on
 on


one
 side
 on
 one
 side
 or
 the
 other.
 Now,


we've
 been
 a
 relatively
 responsible


company.
 Um,
 and
 I
 think
 because
 we


focus
 on
 enterprise,
 I
 think
 we
 have
 a


better
 business
 model.
 I
 think
 we
 have


better
 margins.
 I
 think
 we're
 being


responsible
 about
 it.
 But
 again,
 let's


say
 you
 have
 a
 different
 business
 model.


Let's
 say
 you
 have
 a
 consumer
 business


model,
 aka
 Open
 AI,


>> you
 know,
 you're
 you're
 you're you're


kind
 of
 the
 source
 of
 your
 revenue
 isn't


as
 good.
 Your
 margins
 aren't
 as
 certain,


and
 let's
 say
 you're
 a
 person
 who
 just


kind
 of
 like
 constitutionally
 just
 wants


to
 yolo
 things
 or
 just
 likes
 big


numbers.
 Um,
 uh,
 then
 that
 then
 you
 may


turn
 that
 dial
 pretty
 far.
 And
 so
 I


think
 there
 is
 a
 real
 underlying
 risk.


Whenever
 there's
 uncertainty,
 there's
 a


risk
 of
 overextension.
 We
 all
 face
 it.


>> Look,
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 one
 of
 the
 best


explanations
 I've
 seen
 from
 a
 foundation


model
 LLM
 CEO
 on
 the
 the
 balancing
 of


risks
 between
 overspending
 to
 be
 able
 to


or
 spending
 enough
 to
 be
 able
 to
 have


the
 capacity
 to
 generate
 the
 revenue
 or


overspending
 to
 then
 eventually
 have
 the


fear
 of
 uh
 essentially
 being
 in
 a


bubble,
 right?
 Because
 if
 you're
 have


all
 these
 worthless
 data
 centers
 because


you
 don't
 need
 them,
 that's
 a
 bad
 thing.


And
 it's
 a
 very
 hard
 problem
 to


navigate.
 It
 is
 a
 problem
 that
 the
 bulls


think
 will
 be
 to
 the
 upside
 of
 more
 data


centers
 leading
 to
 uh
 more
 revenue.
 And


the
 bears
 say
 that
 there's
 too
 much


spend
 and
 none
 of
 it's
 actually
 going
 to


materialize.
 Someone's
 going
 to
 be


right,
 someone's
 going
 to
 be
 wrong.
 But


I
 think
 he
 laid
 out
 the
 case
 really


well.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 difference
 here


with
 Anthropic,
 which
 is
 honestly
 why


like
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 Open
 AI
 went
 public


today,
 Anthropic
 went
 public
 today,
 I


think
 Anthropic
 is
 the
 better
 buy
 just


because
 OpenAI
 does
 not
 have
 the
 type
 of


enterprise
 business
 that
 Anthropic
 has.


And
 uh
 they're
 both
 growing
 really
 fast,


but
 enterprises
 are
 really
 sticky
 and


stable.
 Consumers
 are
 not.
 And
 so
 the


question
 then
 becomes
 which
 one
 has


better
 operating
 margins
 that
 can


actually
 put
 up
 the
 money
 to
 pay
 for


this
 compute.
 Now
 we'll
 see
 whatever
 new


products
 OpenAI
 comes
 up
 with.
 And
 you


know,
 Chacht,
 I
 just
 subscribed
 to
 it


the
 other
 day
 because
 it's
 it's
 just


such
 a
 better
 consumer
 model.
 But
 these


are
 the
 AI
 wars.
 I
 think
 Nvidia


ultimately
 wins
 along
 with
 AMD
 and


Broadcom
 and
 all
 these
 other
 guys.
 But


the
 question
 is
 how
 these
 use
 cases


develop
 over
 the
 long
 term.
 We
 do
 have


some
 factory
 orders
 data
 for
 September.


Uh
 this
 was
 delayed
 because
 the


government
 shutdown.
 Let
 me
 pull
 this
 up


real
 quick.
 We
 did
 get
 jobless
 claims
 in


the
 morning.
 So
 let's
 take
 a
 look
 at


this
 data
 and
 then
 we
 will
 keep
 going


from
 there.


>> Hi
 Carl.
 Indeed.
 We're
 looking
 at
 our


September
 reads
 on
 factory
 orders
 and


our
 final
 September
 reads
 on
 durable


goods.
 Factory
 orders
 expected
 to
 be
 up


3/10
 for
 September.
 Still
 playing


catch-up
 on
 the
 data.
 comes
 in
 a
 bit


light
 at
 up
 two
 tents
 and
 last
 month's


robust
 up
 1.4
 retains
 a
 lot
 of
 its


strength
 it's
 revised
 to
 1.3.
 If
 you


strip
 out
 transportation
 still
 pretty


solid
 up
 210
 and
 that
 follows
 a
 minus


110
 that
 was
 a
 revision
 from
 positive


110
 to
 minus
 110.
 Now
 durable
 good
 this


series
 as
 I
 said
 are
 final
 reads


replacing
 midmon
 read
 and
 the


replacements
 well
 exactly
 the
 same
 up


half%
 remains
 and
 if
 you
 strip
 out


transportation
 it
 improves
 up
 610
 same


as
 midmon
 read
 and
 both
 capital
 good


orders
 non-defense
 x
 here
 and
 shipments


both
 up
 a
 very
 robust
 910
 same
 as
 the


midmon
 read
 as


>> all
 right
 not
 too
 bad
 tenure
 is


relatively
 stable
 S&P
 not
 reacting
 too


much
 to
 it.
 We'll
 talk
 about
 the
 layoff


news
 and
 jobs
 data
 in
 just
 a
 second.
 We


uh
 discussed
 it
 in
 the
 morning,
 but


we'll
 get
 a
 little
 deeper
 into
 that.
 AS


right
 there,
 that's
 up
 6%.
 Rockab


continuing
 to
 move.
 Micron's
 down.


Oracle's
 up.
 Nvidia
 up
 about
 1%.
 Meta,


are
 we
 holding
 the
 move?
 Meta
 is
 up
 4%.


Again,
 Meta
 reports
 are
 saying
 they're


going
 to
 lay
 off
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 in


the
 metaverse
 sector
 of
 the
 business
 or


at least
 stop
 spending
 as
 much
 on
 the


metaverse
 by
 up
 to
 30%
 as
 for
 Bloomberg.


That's
 why
 Meta
 is
 up.
 By
 the
 way,


Mexican
 president
 says
 she
 will
 travel


to
 Washington
 on
 Thursday,
 which
 is


today,
 to
 meet
 Trump
 and
 Carney.
 I
 guess


the
 prime
 minister
 of
 Canada
 is
 also


coming
 to


um
 coming
 to
 DC
 today.
 So,
 Canada,
 the


United
 States,
 and


um
 Mexico
 will
 be
 meeting
 here
 today.
 Uh


S&P
 basically
 flat
 at
 683.


That's
 what
 we
 have
 here.
 Um,
 FMC,


thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 Is
 OpenAI
 a


threat
 to
 AMD
 shares
 with
 the
 ties.


Look,
 I've
 been
 saying
 this
 for
 a
 while


on
 AMD,
 which
 is
 that
 the
 only
 reason


this
 thing
 pumped
 as
 aggressively
 as
 it


did,
 and
 it's
 not
 to
 undermine
 any
 part


of
 the
 business,
 but
 it
 was
 stuck
 at
 150


until
 the
 OpenI
 deal
 was
 announced.
 So,


yes,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 massive
 OpenAI


threat
 on
 this
 stock.
 But
 then
 again,


you've
 got
 to
 trust
 that
 OpenAI
 is
 going


to
 come
 through
 with
 the
 money.
 And
 if


they
 don't,
 like
 is
 it
 a
 a
 death
 nail


for
 AMD?
 No.
 Like
 AMD
 will
 still


survive,
 but
 if
 they
 miss
 out
 on
 that
 80


billion
 of
 revenue
 from
 OpenAI
 over
 the


next
 5
 10
 years,
 like
 that's
 not
 good.


Now
 granted,
 they're
 giving
 up
 10%
 of


their
 company
 to
 get
 OpenAI
 to
 give
 them


that
 money.
 So
 the
 the
 entire
 deal
 was


interesting
 to
 say
 the
 least,
 but
 it


helped
 the
 stock
 and
 as
 Lisa
 Sue
 as
 a


CEO,
 you
 know,
 she
 needs
 to
 deliver


shareholder
 returns
 and
 it
 gave
 some


massive
 shareholder
 returns.
 The


question
 now
 becomes
 the
 legitimacy
 of


if
 that
 money
 is
 going
 to
 come.
 Which
 is


why
 I
 think
 even
 if
 you
 hate
 Sam
 Alman,


you
 kind
 of
 have
 to
 be
 bullish
 on


OpenAI.
 Like
 they
 are
 still
 a
 central


lynch
 pin
 in
 regards
 to
 all
 these


different
 companies
 that
 are
 making


deals
 with
 them


and
 that
 that
 is
 important.
 Uh
 Putin
 is


in
 India
 today.
 Do
 we
 have
 a
 quote
 from


him?
 Yes.
 Putin


to
 India
 today
 on
 how
 Trump
 might
 react.


Neither
 me
 nor
 Modi,
 despite
 external


pressure,
 have
 approached
 collaboration


to
 work
 against
 someone.


Well,
 Trump's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 happy
 that


[clears throat]
 Mod's
 going
 to
 Russia.


Yeah,
 there
 he
 is.


Um,


again,
 India
 buys
 a
 lot
 of
 oil
 from


Russia.
 Trump
 doesn't
 like
 it.
 Now,
 if


I'm
 not
 wrong,
 a
 month
 ago,
 Trump
 did
 a


press
 conference
 and
 said
 that
 Modi


would
 stop
 buying
 Russian
 oil.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's
 necessarily


happening.
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 were


skeptical
 when
 he
 said
 that
 a
 month
 ago


because
 India
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 and


those
 people
 need
 energy
 and
 they
 need


cheap
 energy.


So,
 not
 sure
 if
 that's
 going
 to
 change.


Yes,
 I
 say
 Putin.
 That's
 how
 I
 say
 his


name.
 It
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 It's
 crazy


because
 that
 should
 be
 theoretically
 an


easy
 name
 to
 say
 and
 I
 still
 mess
 it
 up,


which
 is
 I
 guess
 just
 how
 it
 operates.


Um
 Kroger
 had
 earnings
 today.
 This
 is
 a


grocery
 store.
 Kroger
 stock,
 ticker


symbol
 KR.
 They
 are
 down
 5%.
 EPS
 they


beat.
 Revenue,
 they
 missed.


Revenue
 miss.
 EPS
 beat.
 Guidance
 is
 a


little
 better
 than
 expected.
 480
 versus


477.
 Kroger's
 stock


down
 5%


right
 here.
 Let's
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an


update
 on
 the
 state
 of
 the
 consumer
 as


well
 as
 we've
 been
 talking
 about
 this


narrative
 a
 lot.
 American
 Eagle


obviously
 had
 some
 really
 good
 earnings


for
 the
 consumer
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep


going
 from
 there.


>> Is
 going
 to
 cut
 interest
 rates
 to
 get


ahead
 of
 the
 labor
 weakness
 and
 all
 of


that
 bodess
 well.


>> That's
 the
 whole
 plastic
 playbook,


right?


>> So,
 we
 did
 get
 some
 commentary
 and
 I


just
 wanted
 to
 highlight
 from
 consumer


companies
 because
 it's
 been
 a
 big
 week


for
 executives
 speaking
 at
 conferences.


Let's
 hear
 let's
 hear
 what
 the
 consumer


is
 doing
 based
 on
 these
 companies.


Coca-Cola
 at
 a
 Morgan
 Stanley


conference.
 If
 the
 consumer
 is
 under


pressure,
 it's
 not
 everyone
 everywhere


at
 all
 times.
 I
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 such


a
 good
 way
 to
 put
 it.
 It's
 something


we've
 been
 talking
 about
 a
 lot.
 The
 top


half
 of
 the
 income
 pyramid
 is
 actually


in
 good
 robust
 shape.
 And
 then
 they
 go


on
 to
 say
 the
 low
 income
 is
 not
 and


we're
 seeing
 that
 manifest
 in
 smaller


basket
 sizes,
 say
 at
 the
 grocery
 store.


Estee
 Lauder,
 it
 is
 clear
 that
 the
 US


consumer
 is
 price
 sensitive
 in
 this


moment
 in
 time,
 is
 resilient,
 but
 is


price
 sensitive.
 again
 sort
 of
 speaks
 to


that
 that
 that
 dynamic
 that
 we've
 been


talking
 about
 valuedriven
 choiceful


price
 sensitive
 but
 resilient
 and
 still


spending
 and
 I'll
 just
 leave
 you
 guys


Carl
 with
 Mastercard
 at
 the
 conference


as
 well
 divergence
 between
 soft
 and
 hard


data
 we
 all
 read
 the
 headlines
 and
 some


of
 the
 survey
 results
 around
 consumer


sentiment
 we
 know
 University
 of
 Michigan


for
 instance
 has
 been
 very
 bad
 uh
 gloomy


according
 to
 the
 Mastercard
 executive


but
 what
 we
 see
 in
 the
 hard
 data


continues
 to
 be
 very
 supportive
 of


consistent
 spend
 metrics.
 Watch
 what


they
 do,
 not
 what
 they
 say.


>> Yeah,
 I
 guess
 I
 would
 throw
 in
 Marriott


today,
 too.
 Uh,
 expect
 Q4
 Revpar
 uh
 to


be
 more
 at
 the
 lower
 end
 of
 the
 range


than
 we
 gave
 for
 one
 to
 two
 in
 for
 uh


Q4.


>> So,
 once
 again,
 the
 divergence
 argument


on
 consumer
 on
 the
 state
 of
 the
 consumer


continues
 to
 be
 the
 the
 headline,
 which


is
 that
 some
 companies
 are
 say,
 I
 mean,


PayPal
 yesterday
 said
 it's
 weak.
 And


then
 you
 got
 Coca-Cola
 saying,
 well,


some
 parts
 are
 weak,
 some
 parts
 are
 not


weak.
 Uber
 and
 a
 firm
 said
 the
 consumer


is
 fine.
 Disney
 said
 they're
 fine.
 I


mean,
 Starbucks
 and
 Chipotle
 said


they're
 struggling.
 So,
 I
 guess
 we're


going
 to
 need
 a
 few
 more
 quarters
 to


really
 develop
 a
 trend
 on
 if
 this


consumer
 weak
 narrative
 is
 legitimate.
 I


my
 personal
 take
 is
 I
 do
 believe
 the


consumer
 is
 weak.
 There's
 no
 way
 one
 can


say
 the
 consumer
 is
 not
 weak
 based
 on


all
 the
 jobs
 data
 we're
 looking
 at.
 Um,


the
 extent
 of
 that
 weakness
 is
 in
 debate


and
 and
 that
 really
 will
 affect
 the


market
 next
 year
 because
 the
 extent
 of


the
 weakness
 determines
 how
 much


disposable
 income
 is
 left
 to
 pay
 for


goods
 and
 services
 which
 ultimately
 will


affect
 company
 earnings.
 Yeah,
 it
 could


just
 be
 a
 PayPal
 and
 Chipotle
 problem.


By
 the
 way,
 Whimo
 is
 coming
 to
 Houston.


Whimo
 is
 coming
 to
 Houston.
 Just


announced
 I
 think
 they
 announced
 like


three
 cities
 yesterday


if
 I'm
 not
 wrong.
 It's
 almost
 been
 like


eight
 to
 10
 cities
 over
 the
 past
 month


on
 Whimo,
 which
 is
 quite
 incredible


on
 the
 uh
 on
 the
 expansion.
 VRT,
 another


data
 center
 play
 that
 is
 up
 about
 0.25%.


So,
 a
 lot of
 the
 data
 center
 plays
 at


least
 holding
 some
 of
 their
 green
 today.


UPS
 still
 down
 about
 2%.
 Octa,
 that's
 up


a
 little
 bit.
 Salesforce,
 I
 agree
 with


Steve,
 they
 they
 put
 up
 a
 good
 quarter.


I'm
 very
 surprised
 the
 stock
 is
 still


not
 making
 a
 move.
 I
 mean,
 I
 had
 a


feeling
 it
 wouldn't,
 but
 it's
 it's
 down


30%
 year
 to
 date.
 You
 would
 think
 any


level
 of
 good
 agent
 force
 stuff
 would


get
 its
 move,
 but
 it
 was
 just
 not
 enough


on
 a
 day
 like
 this.
 Philly,
 Baltimore,


Pittsburgh,
 and
 St.
 Louis
 were
 announced


yesterday
 for
 Whimo.


It's
 pretty
 incredible.
 These
 guys
 are


continuing
 to
 expand.
 The
 consumer
 is


okay
 until
 the
 stock
 market
 tanks.
 The


bull
 market
 has
 to
 continue
 or
 else


Yeah.
 Look,
 we've
 talked
 about
 this


argument
 a
 lot,
 which
 is
 that
 the


K-shaped
 economy
 needs
 the
 upper
 end
 of


the
 consumer
 to
 keep
 spending,
 which


means
 they
 need
 to
 have
 asset
 prices


continue
 to
 go
 higher.
 And
 again,
 I


think
 Trump
 knows
 this.
 By
 the
 way,


there
 was
 another
 headline
 yesterday


that
 says
 Trump
 is
 thinking
 of
 making


Bent
 not
 only
 his
 um


not
 only
 his
 Treasury
 Secretary,
 which


he
 already
 is,
 but
 his
 top
 economic


adviser,
 if
 Kevin
 Hassid,
 who
 is
 the


current
 top
 economic
 adviser
 for
 uh


Trump,
 if
 if
 Hasset
 becomes
 the
 next
 Fed


chair,
 then
 Trump
 is
 considering
 making


Bent
 the
 next
 top
 economic
 adviser.
 I


think
 Bent's
 already
 like
 a
 very


influential
 figure
 to
 Trump.
 I
 mean,


Bent
 was
 talking
 about
 how
 Trump
 calls


him
 in
 the
 middle
 of the
 night
 almost


every
 week,
 but
 this
 would
 solidify
 Bent


and
 Trump
 basically
 running
 the
 economy


if
 if
 Hasset
 becomes
 a
 uh
 a
 Fed
 chair.


So,
 whatever
 Bent
 says
 and
 the
 way
 they


think
 about
 the
 economy
 is
 definitely


going
 to
 be
 very
 important.
 And
 the
 way


they
 think
 about
 the
 economy
 is
 growth.


Growth
 at
 all
 costs.
 So
 for
 all
 of
 us


that
 are
 investors,
 you
 know,
 that's


kind
 of
 what
 you
 want
 to
 hear.
 And


growth
 at
 all
 cost
 means
 that
 the
 market


can't
 have
 a
 downyear.
 Now,
 could
 it


could
 technically
 have
 a
 down
 year?
 Of


course,
 but
 from
 the
 administration's


perspective,
 they
 cannot
 they
 really


can't
 have
 a
 they
 cannot
 have
 an
 S&P


down
 20%.
 Like
 that's
 just
 I
 mean


because
 a
 lot
 of
 stocks
 are
 going
 to
 be


down,
 you
 know,
 much
 more
 than
 20%.
 They


can't
 have
 that
 happen.
 We
 don't
 we


don't
 have
 the
 capacity
 to
 pay
 for
 all


the
 debt
 and
 to
 manage
 even
 a
 little
 bit


of
 our
 deficit
 if
 we
 have
 negative


quarters
 multiple
 quarters
 in
 a
 row of


contracting
 GDP.
 It's
 just
 not
 possible.


Which
 again,
 regardless
 of
 what
 you


think
 about
 the
 economy,
 state
 of
 the


consumer,
 recession,


you
 I
 think
 that
 narrative
 in
 and
 of


itself
 is
 a
 is
 a
 Trump
 put,
 Fed
 put,


whatever
 you
 want
 to
 call
 it
 on
 the


market.
 Tesla
 right
 there,
 449,


which
 theoretically
 means
 one
 should
 be


long
 versus
 not.


I
 only
 have
 Amazon
 stock,
 not
 options.


Uh,
 I'm
 a
 little
 scared
 for
 options


going
 into
 next
 year.
 I
 do
 not
 have
 the


balls
 that
 Chris
 has
 to
 put
 a
 million


into
 freaking
 Meta
 Options.
 No,
 a
 bit.
 I


don't
 have
 750,000.
 I
 have
 1.2
 million.


Goodness,
 dude.


Well,
 I'm
 I'm
 happy
 it's
 working.
 I'm


happy
 because
 Chris
 is
 a
 good
 friend
 of


mine
 and
 I
 would
 really
 want
 this
 to


work
 for
 him.
 So,
 uh
 yeah,
 I'm
 I'm
 just


I'm
 I'm
 scared
 of
 options
 next
 year.
 I'm


scared
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 volatility
 next
 year.


I
 want
 to
 be
 long,
 but
 I
 don't
 want
 to


be
 leverage
 long
 to
 the
 point
 where
 like


I
 need
 to
 depend
 on
 a
 strike
 price
 and


an
 expiration.


So,
 I
 would
 just
 I
 would
 just
 be
 buying


Amazon
 stock.
 Path
 big
 move
 on
 path
 173.


Wow.
 If
 you
 took
 a
 swing
 at
 this
 for


earnings
 18%
 congratulations
 first


profitable
 quarter.
 I
 didn't
 know
 they


weren't
 profitable.
 If
 if
 I
 knew
 PATH


had
 a
 chance
 to
 produce
 their
 first
 gap


net
 income
 positive
 quarter
 maybe
 I


would
 have
 even
 taken
 an
 earning
 swing


at
 this
 thing
 because
 immediately
 when


you
 become
 profitable
 the
 narrative


changes
 especially
 on
 a
 gap
 basis.
 So


that
 is
 really
 strong
 for
 path.
 And


again
 this
 goes
 back
 to
 stock
 talk
 was


saying
 yesterday
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 stock


market
 is
 how
 much
 information
 do
 you


know?
 Like
 I
 I
 didn't
 look
 into
 bath.
 I


didn't
 know
 that
 they
 were
 very
 close
 to


being
 profitable.
 If
 I
 did,
 maybe
 I


would
 have
 been
 like,
 "All
 right,
 let
 me


buy
 a
 100
 shares
 and
 just
 see
 what


happens
 if
 they
 become
 profitable."
 Like


even
 that
 information
 alone
 could
 have


made
 a
 trade.
 But
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 is
 just,


you
 know,
 what
 information
 do
 you
 have?


What
 information
 do
 you
 not
 have?
 ESTs


8%.


That
 one
 getting
 another
 move
 right


there,
 8.3.
 Space
 Mob
 continues
 to
 have


this
 stock
 normalize
 in
 the
 50
 to
 60


range.


>> [laughter]


>> Austin
 says,
 "I'm
 gonna
 appear
 in
 a


midstream
 and
 make
 him
 buy
 Amazon


calls."
 The
 other
 thing
 that
 Stock
 talk


said
 yesterday
 was
 for
 everyone
 who's


trying
 to
 buy
 like
 these
 Amazon
 $300


leaps.
 Amazon
 doesn't
 need
 to
 get
 to


300.
 It
 needs
 to
 get
 to
 300
 plus
 the


premium
 you're
 paying
 for
 the
 leap.
 Like


people
 forget
 like
 it's
 not
 just
 the


stock
 has
 to
 get
 to
 the
 strike,
 it
 has


to
 get
 to
 the
 strike
 plus
 your
 premium,


which
 means
 your
 break
 even
 might
 be
 way


more.
 So
 buying
 closer
 to
 in
 the
 money


calls
 I
 do
 think
 is
 a
 strong
 strategy.


If
 your
 conviction
 is
 strong,
 but
 your


conviction
 is
 not
 like
 unbelievably


unwavering
 strong.
 So
 when
 I
 bought
 hood


options
 at
 $25
 strike
 when
 it
 was
 at
 $8,


you
 know,
 the
 conviction
 was
 just
 like


real,
 like
 real.
 Like
 I
 I
 have


conviction
 on
 Amazon.
 Do
 I
 know
 for
 sure


it's
 going
 to
 freaking
 300?
 No,
 there's


no
 way.
 Amazon.
 Wow.
 228
 below
 230.


Especially
 given
 the
 volatility
 in
 this


stock
 is
 not
 really
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 the


other
 high
 beta
 names.
 um
 it'll
 move
 up


and
 then
 it'll
 gap
 down
 immediately
 and


it
 won't
 really
 hold
 their
 gain.
 So,


I
 do
 think
 stock
 over
 options
 is
 not
 the


worst
 idea.
 APLD,
 that's
 up
 2%.
 Verizon


getting
 a
 little bit
 of
 a
 move.
 Let's


look
 at
 the
 heat
 map
 today
 and
 see


what's
 green
 and
 what's
 red.


Yeah,
 in
 the
 money
 in
 the
 money
 leaps


are
 more
 responsible
 degeneracy,
 you


could
 say.
 Uh
 we
 are


let's
 see


we
 are
 red
 but


green
 in
 financials,
 industrials,


consumer
 durables,
 tech
 is
 red,


healthcare
 is
 also
 red.
 Meta
 and
 Nvidia


are
 the
 only
 real
 green
 names


in


in
 technology.
 Redcat,
 that's
 up
 4%
 on


the
 day.
 They
 had
 a
 pretty
 good
 earnings


last
 week.
 So,
 Redcat
 is
 also
 up
 and


that
 is
 green.
 Getting
 some
 momentum


there.
 Reddit
 as
 well,
 uh,
 down
 2.3%.


Another
 high
 beta
 name
 that's
 down


as
 that
 one
 continues
 to
 go
 red.


Apploving
 that's
 up
 2.49%.
 Robin
 Hood


13430.
 And
 then
 Amcore.
 Amcore
 holding


on
 to
 the
 40s,
 dude.
 I
 mean,
 the
 fact


that
 it's
 normalizing
 the
 40s,
 I
 think,


is
 really
 nice
 to
 see.
 This
 thing
 almost


hit
 44
 yesterday,
 so
 that's
 not
 too
 bad.


Symbotic
 is
 down
 50%
 because
 they
 had
 an


offering
 yesterday
 and
 so
 even
 the


robotics
 news
 from
 the
 administration


was
 just
 not
 good
 enough
 for
 this
 one


as
 this
 also
 came
 down


FMC
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat
 buying


more
 grab
 this
 is
 ridiculous
 yeah
 look
 I


mean
 the
 thing
 about
 grab
 and
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 asking
 like
 what
 is
 the


update
 the
 problem
 is
 there's
 no
 news


there's
 as
 Chris
 was
 saying
 sometimes


there's
 a
 dog
 day
 there
 there's
 dog
 days


or
 dog
 months
 on
 a
 stock
 and
 there's
 no


news
 there's
 like
 nothing
 to
 report
 if


there
 was
 be
 reporting
 it.
 The
 only
 news


we
 had
 in
 the
 past
 week
 is
 that
 they


have
 a
 new
 board
 director.
 And
 so


sometimes
 when
 there's
 not
 news,
 there's


there's
 not
 much
 you
 can
 do
 other
 than


wait.
 And
 that's
 when
 you
 have
 to
 ask


yourself,
 do
 you
 trust
 and
 have


conviction
 in
 a
 story
 that
 you
 think
 is


going
 to
 play
 out?
 And
 either
 you
 do
 or


you
 don't.
 And
 what
 I
 will
 say
 with
 Grab


is
 again,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 names


that
 have
 a
 lot
 more
 volatility.
 And
 so


if
 you
 kind
 of
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 in


something
 that
 is
 stuck,
 that's
 okay.


But
 if
 you
 think
 it's
 stuck


inappropriately
 and
 eventually
 that
 will


be
 rerated


like
 you
 know
 many
 other
 names
 that
 have


been
 stuck
 before
 then
 that's
 a
 decision


that
 people
 have
 to
 make.
 We
 have
 some


coverage
 right
 here
 on
 this
 metaverse


news.
 Let's
 pull
 this
 up
 and
 see
 what


the
 cell
 side
 is
 thinking
 about
 what


Zucks
 might
 be
 doing
 for
 the
 metaverse


head
 of
 technology
 research
 uh
 for
 his


take
 on
 this.
 So
 Gil,
 how
 do
 you
 think


about
 it
 in
 terms
 of
 magnitude
 of


spending?
 the
 markets,
 you
 know,
 added


about
 100
 billion
 in
 market
 cap
 to
 uh
 to


Meta
 this
 morning
 in
 response.


>> Yeah.
 If
 they
 shut
 down
 the
 Reality
 Labs


business,
 uh
 earnings
 would
 go
 up
 by


about
 25%.


>> They
 lost
 $18
 billion
 dollar
 last
 year.


And
 and
 let's
 not
 forget
 it's
 the


business
 is
 there
 for
 a
 reason.
 Um
 Mark


Zuckerberg
 wants
 to
 own
 the
 next


platform.
 The
 next
 hardware
 platform
 in


his
 eyes
 will
 be
 a
 combination
 of


glasses
 and
 goggles,
 not
 a
 handset.
 And


he
 doesn't
 want
 that
 to
 be
 owned
 by


Apple
 and
 Google
 anymore
 because
 he
 has


to
 pay
 them
 30%
 off
 the
 top.
 That's
 why


he's
 been
 investing
 so
 much
 over
 the


years
 in
 reality
 labs.
 But
 what's


happened
 is
 he's
 realized
 that
 AI
 is


much
 further
 down
 the
 road
 than
 the


shift
 to
 the
 hardware
 platform.
 So
 he


would
 rather
 invest
 in
 winning
 in
 AI
 and


building
 data
 centers
 to
 support
 his


research
 and
 better
 frontier
 models
 and


better
 chat
 than
 invest
 in
 the
 hardware


platform
 which
 may
 take
 longer
 to
 play


out.
 That
 doesn't
 mean
 we're
 not
 going


to
 get
 better
 Ray-B
 band
 glasses
 and


Oakleys
 and
 the
 display
 glasses.
 It
 just


means
 that
 he
 needs
 to
 shift
 some
 of


those
 resources
 to
 AI
 because
 AI
 is


incredibly
 competitive
 with
 Google,
 with


OpenAI,
 with
 Anthropic,
 and
 to
 some


extent
 with
 Amazon,
 Microsoft,
 and
 many


Chinese
 players.
 So
 that's
 what
 he's


doing.
 He's
 moving
 chips
 from
 Reality


Labs
 to
 the
 AI
 investment.


>> That
 would
 imply
 though
 that
 he's
 not


going
 to
 let
 all
 the
 money
 fall
 to
 the


bottom
 line
 that
 that
 they're
 not


spending
 on
 metaverse,
 right?
 I
 mean,
 I


know
 we
 don't
 know
 granular
 details


here,
 but
 it
 would
 suggest
 that,
 you


know,
 essentially
 patting
 out
 the
 AI


investment
 budget.


>> Well,
 that's
 right.
 That's
 why
 investors


were
 disappointed
 when
 they
 reported
 the


quarter.
 They
 reported
 25%
 topline


growth
 in
 the
 quarter,
 which
 by
 the
 way


is
 almost
 twice
 as
 much
 as
 Google.
 It's


faster
 than
 Microsoft,
 Apple,
 and


Amazon.
 And
 the
 stock
 was
 down
 because


they
 commented
 about
 increasing
 capex


and
 operating
 expenses
 even
 faster
 than


that
 next
 year,
 meaning
 lower
 margins


and
 not
 as
 much
 earnings
 growth.
 So


investors
 reacted
 badly
 to
 that
 and
 and


as
 he's
 done
 in
 the
 past,
 he's
 realized


that
 in
 order
 to
 keep
 the
 share
 price


going
 up,
 he
 needs
 to
 moderate
 that.
 So


he
 needs
 to
 move
 some
 resources
 from


real
 labs
 to
 AI
 so
 he
 can
 maintain


margins
 into
 next
 year
 and
 can
 continue


to
 grow
 earnings
 at
 the
 rate
 of
 revenue


growth
 which
 again
 is
 a
 very
 healthy


healthy
 revenue
 growth.


>> Where
 does
 Meta
 sit
 right
 now
 in
 the
 in


the
 horse
 race
 that
 is
 becoming
 AI?


They're
 they're
 certainly
 a
 top
 spender,


but
 where
 do
 they
 what's
 their


leadership
 leadership
 position
 right


now?


Oh,
 they're
 far
 behind
 right
 now.
 Let's


not
 forget
 two
 years
 ago,
 Llama
 3
 jumped


to
 the
 head
 of
 the
 charts
 as
 the
 best


open-source
 model,
 but
 then
 earlier
 this


year,
 Llama
 4
 was
 a
 colossal
 disaster.


That's
 why
 he's
 increased
 his
 investment


both
 in
 data
 centers
 and
 in
 talent


because
 they
 are
 out
 of
 the
 race
 right


now.
 Again,
 the
 the
 top
 the
 top
 of
 the


leaderboard
 is
 is
 Gemini
 and
 very


closely
 after
 that
 open
 AAI
 and


Anthropic
 depending
 on
 what
 benchmark


you're
 looking
 at
 with
 the
 Chinese


catching
 up
 very
 quickly
 and
 and
 Meta's


network.
 They're
 not
 in
 the
 top
 25
 as


far
 as
 our
 rankings
 are
 concerned.
 That


doesn't
 mean
 that
 Llama
 5
 won't
 start


catching
 up,
 but
 that's
 how
 high
 the


stakes
 are.
 But
 beyond
 just
 the
 the


capability
 uh
 on
 leadership
 on
 their


models,
 what
 about
 on
 the
 on
 the
 future


revenues,
 right?
 As
 the
 market
 has
 now


become
 obsessed
 with
 when
 it
 happens,


how
 it
 happens,
 like
 there's
 always
 this


question,
 right?
 Because
 unlike
 an


alphabet
 or
 even
 an
 anthropic
 and
 an


open
 AI
 now,
 they're
 just
 they're
 not
 in


the
 enterprise
 in
 any
 meaningful
 way


besides
 advertising.
 So
 what
 what
 is
 the


what
 is
 the
 vision
 there?
 Obviously,


they're
 making
 a
 ton
 of
 money
 on


advertising
 and
 they're
 monetizing
 the


AI
 with
 that
 business,
 but
 is
 there


another
 story
 there
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 to


enterprise
 and
 the
 AI
 payoff?


>> There
 could
 be.
 So,
 first
 of
 all,
 to


your
 point,
 they're
 selling
 more
 ads
 and


they're
 selling
 them
 at
 a
 higher
 price.


That's
 why
 they're
 gaining
 so
 much
 share


in
 digital
 advertising.
 Again,
 growing


twice
 as
 fast
 as
 Google
 in
 digital


advertising.
 They
 are
 the
 share
 gainer


because
 they're
 using
 these
 capabilities


to
 sell
 more
 ads,
 sell
 them
 for
 a
 higher


price.
 The
 plan
 is
 for
 AI
 at
 the
 very


least
 is
 to
 compel
 consumers
 to
 stay


even
 longer
 in
 their
 apps.
 If
 you're


using
 their
 chat
 to
 ask
 for
 advice,
 so


in
 the
 Instagram
 search
 bar,
 you're


typing
 questions
 asking
 for
 advice.
 What


should
 I
 say?
 What
 should
 I
 tell
 them?


Should
 I
 contact
 this
 person?
 These
 are.


>> So,
 here's
 the
 question,
 and
 this
 is
 the


more
 bearish
 case
 for
 Meta.
 How
 many


people
 actually
 think
 on
 Instagram


you're
 going
 to
 search
 for
 a
 recipe
 and


you're
 going
 to
 use
 their
 inbuilt
 AI?


Like,
 is
 that
 going
 to
 be
 the
 deacto
 way


consumers
 interact
 with
 meta
 AI?
 Because


that
 that's
 a
 big
 deal
 if
 you
 know,


billions
 of
 people
 start
 asking
 queries.


That's
 what
 catchup
 and
 Gemini
 are


trying
 to
 do.
 Instagram
 already
 has


users,
 but
 will
 it
 result
 in
 that
 type


of
 a
 consumer
 behavior?
 And
 I
 think
 that


that's
 really
 a
 question
 the
 street
 is


thinking
 heavily
 about.


>> The
 types
 of
 questions
 people
 are
 asking


in
 Instagram
 that
 keeps
 you
 in
 the


platform
 longer.
 More
 ads,
 higher
 price


ads.
 There's
 also
 the
 possibility
 that


at
 some
 point
 they
 start
 selling
 their


capacity
 elsewhere.
 Let's
 not
 forget


Amazon,
 Microsoft,
 Google
 when
 they're


building
 data
 centers,
 it's
 because
 they


have
 three-year
 contracts
 with
 companies


to
 sell
 them
 that
 capacity.
 Meta
 is


investing
 just
 as
 much
 for
 their
 own


internal
 use.
 At
 some
 point
 when
 they


have
 strong
 enough
 models
 and
 they
 don't


have
 to
 use
 that
 capacity
 to
 train,
 they


could
 turn
 around
 and
 sell
 that
 capacity


and
 start
 competing
 with
 Microsoft,


Amazon,
 and
 Google.
 That's
 why
 Mark


Zuckerberg
 isn't
 worried
 about


overinvesting
 because
 he
 knows
 that


capacity
 will
 be
 valuable
 beyond
 just


training
 his
 own
 models.


>> Yeah.
 which
 is
 I
 mean
 obviously
 where


AWS
 came
 from


>> and
 that's
 the
 question
 that's
 the


question
 for
 Zucks.
 So
 if
 this
 metaverse


spend
 just
 goes
 into
 more
 capex
 super


bullish
 the
 chip
 names
 then
 the
 question


just
 becomes
 can
 Z
 monetize
 it
 and
 get


consumer
 behavior
 to
 be
 on
 his
 side
 and


again
 if
 consumer
 behavior
 doesn't
 get


on
 his
 side
 but
 the
 advertising
 is
 still


good
 the
 street
 is
 going
 to
 keep
 asking


the
 question
 what
 is
 the
 next
 product


besides
 advertising
 and
 I
 think
 that's


what
 Zux
 is
 trying
 to
 figure
 out.
 Now,


the
 other
 update
 on
 Meta.
 Uh,
 by
 the


way,
 Rocket
 Lab
 and
 AS
 really
 making
 a


move.
 I'm
 trying
 to
 [snorts]
 see
 the


headline
 for
 space,
 but
 space
 stocks
 are


going
 up
 heavily
 right
 now.
 Uh,
 Zuck


said
 this
 yesterday.
 Today,
 we're


establishing
 a
 new
 creative
 studio
 in


reality
 reality
 labs
 led
 by
 Alan
 Dy,
 who


spent
 20
 years
 leading
 design
 at
 Apple.


Uh,
 the
 new
 studio
 will
 bring
 together


design,
 fashion,
 and
 tech
 to
 define
 the


next
 generation
 of
 our
 new
 products
 and


experiences.
 Our
 ideas
 to
 treat


intelligence
 as
 a
 new
 design
 material


and
 imagine
 what
 becomes
 possible
 when


it
 is
 abundant,
 capable,
 and
 human-


centered.
 We
 plan
 to
 elevate
 design


within
 meta
 and
 pull
 together
 a
 talented


group
 with
 a
 combination
 of
 craft,


creative
 vision,
 systems
 thinking,
 and


deep
 experience
 building
 iconic
 products


that
 bridge
 hardware
 and
 software.


By
 the
 way,
 the
 guy
 that
 they
 got
 from


Apple
 was
 one
 of
 the
 chief
 design


architects
 for
 uh
 the
 vision
 pro.
 So,
 it


seems
 like
 Zucks
 is
 quite
 literally


telling
 everyone
 that
 their
 next
 big


thing
 in
 AI
 or
 like
 intelligence
 as
 he's


defining
 it
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 hardware


focused
 intelligence
 experience,
 which


again,
 if
 if
 you
 hit
 that,
 you
 hit
 the


jackpot
 because
 theoretically
 could


replace
 the
 iPhone.
 But
 the
 question
 is,


can
 they
 do
 that?
 ESTs
 up
 9.5
 right


here.


I
 don't
 see
 a
 headline
 on
 this
 one.
 If


anyone
 has
 it,
 let
 me
 know.
 cactus.
 If


you
 see
 something
 on
 the
 space
 names,


you
 can
 send
 it.
 But
 I
 don't
 see


anything
 too
 crazy.


Um,


all
 of
 these
 names
 getting
 a
 move
 though


right
 here.
 AS
 up
 9%.
 That's
 a
 big
 move,


dude.
 9%.
 Rocket
 Lab
 up
 four


on
 the
 day.
 Headline
 for
 space.
 Alman
 is


looking
 to
 buy
 a
 space
 company.


Uh
 maybe
 maybe
 that
 could
 be
 the


headline.


Um


definitely
 is
 a
 chance
 the
 market
 could


be
 interpreting
 that
 in
 a
 certain
 way.
 I


do
 think
 I
 have
 something
 I
 can
 pull
 up


on
 this.
 Let
 me
 see


if
 I
 have
 it
 here.


Um


okay,
 let's
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here.


There
 was
 some
 contract
 with
 Rocket
 Lab,


I
 think,
 that
 came
 out
 yesterday.
 Rocket


Lab.


Yeah,
 let
 me
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here.


This
 this
 this
 could
 actually
 be
 the


reason
 for
 Rocket
 Lab.
 And
 I
 don't
 know


if
 this
 has
 an
 impact
 on
 as
 well,
 but
 uh


there
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 this
 is
 confirmed


Rocket
 Lab
 or
 not.
 Is
 it


is
 it?
 Yes,
 it
 is.
 Okay.
 So,
 legal


business
 name
 right
 there.
 You
 see


Rocket
 Lab.
 So
 this
 is
 the
 contractor


shall
 develop
 gen
 one
 solar
 sale
 mission


concepts
 that
 will
 address
 the


objectives
 of
 the
 future
 implementation


plan
 in
 accordance
 with
 the
 manifest


requirements
 unique
 vehicle
 capability


assessment
 and
 future
 space
 technology


integration
 study
 demonstration


alignment
 with
 flight
 opportunity


projective
 or
 program
 objectives
 and


goals


solar
 and
 space


maybe
 maybe
 that's
 something


that
 is
 an
 amendment
 to
 the
 contract
 I


have
 no
 idea
 what
 that
 contract
 is
 about


but
 that
 could
 be
 something
 that's


getting
 the
 market
 at
 least
 to
 think
 a


little
 bit
 more
 deeply
 about
 their
 2026


opportunity.
 You
 guys
 saying
 as
 insider


bought
 shares?


Oh,
 well
 that'll
 do
 it.
 He's
 really


buying
 shares
 after
 a
 2x
 in
 his
 stock.


I
 mean
 that
 would
 be
 pretty
 bullish


if
 he
 is.
 Let
 me
 see
 if
 we
 have
 a


different
 headline
 right
 here.
 Rock
 lab


right
 there
 4681.


Again,
 Meta
 is
 pumping
 on
 that
 news
 of


cutting


back
 the
 metaverse
 spend
 for
 those
 that


are
 just
 joining.


I
 don't
 see
 any
 other
 crazy
 headline
 on


these
 names.
 Don't
 see
 them
 today.
 So,


we'll
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 more
 details
 on


it.
 But
 that
 one
 is
 moving
 heavy.
 Rivian


right
 there.
 1756,
 that's
 green.
 Rocket


Lab,
 that's
 up
 5%.
 AS
 up
 10%.
 UiPath
 up


18%.
 My
 goodness.
 Salesforce
 now
 up
 2%.


Nebas
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 S&P
 still
 flat
 on


the
 day.
 and
 Nvidia
 at
 181


as
 FM1
 launch
 on
 1215
 in
 India.
 Okay,


but
 did
 the
 market
 know
 that
 they
 were


going
 to
 have
 this
 launch?
 Is
 that
 like


new
 news?
 Because
 if
 it
 is,
 then
 maybe


that's
 the
 reason.
 If
 it
 was
 already


priced
 in,
 then
 maybe
 not.


The
 Verizon
 AS
 stuff
 has
 been
 news
 for
 a


while.


Rocket
 Lab
 made
 the
 list
 to
 compete
 for


151
 billion
 in
 Golden
 Dome
 task
 or


quarters.


That
 actually
 could
 be
 a
 I
 mean
 everyone


knows
 that
 Rock
 Lab
 is
 integ
 or
 trying


to
 be
 integral
 to
 the
 Golden
 Dome.


They've
 mentioned
 it
 many
 times
 on


different
 interviews.


So
 that
 could
 be
 big
 as
 well.
 USA
 rare


earth
 that's
 up
 7%
 as
 well.
 Some
 of
 the


rare
 earth
 stocks
 getting
 back
 into


favor.
 MP
 materials
 50
 and
 96
 that's
 up


as
 well.
 Amazon
 continues
 to
 get
 hit.


Don't
 understand
 even
 after
 that
 AWS
 uh


event
 they
 had
 two
 days
 ago.
 I'm
 very


confused


why
 Amazon
 is
 getting
 hit
 as
 badly
 as


they
 are.


Rocket
 Lab
 won
 AWS
 company
 of
 the
 year


last
 night.
 Really?


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 good
 headlines
 for


Rocket
 Lab.
 Yeah,
 Rocket
 Lab
 AWS
 company


of
 the
 year.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's
 why


it's
 up
 5%,
 but
 definitely
 doesn't
 hurt.


Okay,
 there
 you
 go.


That's
 another
 thing
 we
 got
 there.
 Um,


okay.
 So,
 let's
 pull
 up
 a
 couple
 of


other


different
 headlines
 that
 we're
 looking


at.
 10:30
 right
 here.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we


get
 this
 10:30
 slam.


Haven't
 seen
 a
 ton
 of
 volatility
 yet.
 Uh


Costco
 had
 some
 really
 good
 sales
 data


yesterday
 as
 well.
 Costco,
 are
 we
 up
 or


down?
 It
 was
 up
 like
 8%
 year-over-year.


Beat
 expectations
 pretty
 heavily.
 Costco


is
 down
 3%.
 You
 don't
 see
 a
 3%
 move
 that


often
 on
 Costco.


I
 mean,
 the
 sales
 orders,
 I
 think
 this


was
 for
 the
 month
 of
 November,
 were


really
 good
 yesterday
 across
 Canada
 and


the
 United
 States,


but
 you
 have
 Costco


uh
 you
 have
 Costco
 taking
 a
 hit
 right


here.
 Um,
 okay.
 So,
 let
 me
 pull
 this
 up.


So,
 um,
 let's
 look
 at
 a
 couple
 of
 these


clips
 from
 Jensen
 on
 the
 podcast
 because


there
 was
 a
 bunch
 of
 different
 things


going
 on.
 for
 all
 the
 people
 that
 are


bullish
 in
 nuclear
 here
 is
 Jensen's
 take


on
 where
 energy
 may
 be
 going
 over
 the


next
 5
 years


>> is
 my
 point.
 So
 currently
 that
 that
 is
 a


big
 bottleneck
 right
 is
 energy.


>> Yeah
 it
 is
 the
 bottleneck.


>> The
 bottleneck
 is
 this.
 So
 was
 it
 Google


that
 is
 making
 nuclear
 power
 plants
 to


operate
 one
 of
 its
 AI
 factories?


>> Oh
 I
 haven't
 heard
 that
 but
 I
 think
 in


the
 next
 six
 seven
 years
 I
 think
 you're


going
 to
 see
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 small


nuclear
 reactors.


>> And
 by
 small
 like
 how
 big
 you
 talking


about?


>> Hundreds
 of
 megawatts.
 Yeah.


>> Okay.
 And
 that
 these
 will
 be
 local
 to


whatever
 specific
 company
 they
 have.


>> That's
 right.
 We'll
 all
 be
 power


generators.


>> Whoa.


>> You
 know,
 just
 like
 just
 like
 your
 you


know,
 somebody's
 farm.


>> It
 probably
 is
 the
 smartest
 way
 to
 do


it,
 right?


>> And
 it
 takes
 the
 burden
 off
 Yeah.
 takes


the
 burden
 off
 the
 grid.
 It
 takes
 and


you
 could
 build
 as
 much
 as
 you
 need


>> and
 you
 can
 contribute
 back
 to
 the
 grid.


It's
 is
 my
 point.
 So
 current


>> I
 mean
 look
 if
 you're
 an
 Oaklo
 SMR
 a
 lot


of these
 names
 have
 pumped
 on
 the


narrative
 that
 there's
 a
 shot
 that
 uh


you
 know
 nuclear
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the


future
 and
 it
 seems
 like
 based
 on
 even


what
 Jensen
 is
 saying
 even
 if
 it's
 5
 to


10
 years
 out
 we're
 going
 to
 need
 energy


from
 somewhere
 and
 that
 might
 happen


from
 uh
 nuclear.
 Here's
 the
 other
 clip


from
 the
 interview
 that
 I
 thought
 was


important.
 This
 was
 Jensen
 describing


the
 first
 time
 someone
 ever
 wanted
 his


supercomput.
 And
 that
 person
 happened
 to


be
 Mr.
 Elon
 Musk.
 When
 I
 announced
 this


thing,
 nobody
 in
 the
 world
 wanted
 it.
 I


had
 no
 purchase
 orders.
 Not
 not
 one.


Nobody
 wanted
 to
 buy
 it.
 Nobody
 wanted


to
 be
 part
 of
 it
 except
 for
 Elon.
 He


goes,
 he
 was
 at
 the
 event
 and
 we
 were


doing
 a
 fireside
 chat
 about
 the
 future


of
 self-driving
 cars
 and
 he
 goes,
 "You


know
 what?


I
 have
 a
 company
 that
 could
 really
 use


this."


I
 said,
 "Wow,
 my
 first
 customer."
 And


so,
 so
 I
 was
 pretty
 excited
 about
 it.


And
 he
 goes,
 "Uh,
 yeah,
 uh,
 we
 have
 this


company.
 It's
 a
 nonprofit
 company."


and
 all
 the
 blood
 drained
 out
 of
 my


face.
 [laughter]
 I
 just
 spent
 a
 few


billion
 dollars
 building
 this
 thing
 cost


$300,000
 and
 you
 know
 the
 chances
 of
 a


nonprofit
 being
 able
 to
 pay
 for
 this


thing
 is
 approximately
 zero.
 And
 he


goes,
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 a
 it's
 an
 AI


company
 and
 uh
 it's
 a
 nonprofit
 and
 and


uh
 we
 could
 really
 use
 one
 of these


supercomputers.
 And
 so
 I
 I
 picked
 it
 up.


I
 built
 the
 first
 one
 for
 ourselves.


We're
 using
 it
 inside
 the
 company.
 I


boxed
 one
 up.
 I
 drove
 it
 up
 to
 San


Francisco
 and
 I
 delivered
 to
 Elon
 in


2016
 and
 uh
 I
 walk
 up
 to
 the
 second


floor
 where
 they
 were
 all
 kind
 of
 in
 a


room
 this
 smaller
 than
 your
 place
 here


and
 and
 uh
 uh
 that
 place
 turned
 out
 to


have
 been
 OpenAI.


>> It's
 not
 really
 uh
 nonprofit
 anymore


though,
 is
 it?


>> They're
 not
 they're
 not
 nonprofit


anymore.
 Yeah.


>> Weird
 how
 that
 works.


It's


>> pretty
 cool
 story.
 Now,
 everyone
 in
 the


world
 can't
 get
 enough
 of
 these
 chips.


And
 in
 the
 beginning,
 I
 mean,
 talk
 about


humble,
 humble
 beginnings.
 Jensen


had
 no
 one
 who
 wanted
 the
 chips
 other


than
 Elon.
 Elon
 saw
 the
 use
 case.
 This


is
 why
 Elon
 is
 Elon.
 And
 now,
 you
 know,


everyone
 sees
 the
 use
 case
 and
 they


can't
 get
 enough
 of
 these
 chips.
 Nvidia


right
 there,
 1817


as
 that
 one
 still
 is
 green
 on
 the
 day.


Bloom
 Energy,
 look
 at
 that
 7%
 move
 on


Bloom.
 the
 energy
 names
 continuing


to
 catch
 a
 bid
 and
 space
 mob
 as
 12%.
 If


it's
 because
 of
 that
 India
 launch
 news,


then
 I
 guess
 that's
 the
 headline.


But
 as
 right
 there
 uh
 getting
 some
 love


along
 with


along
 with
 Rocket
 Lab.
 Uh
 as
 did
 get
 an


upgrade,
 but
 that
 was
 a
 week
 ago
 on


November
 24th.


Yeah,
 I
 mean
 seems
 like
 that
 could
 be


logic
 for
 it.
 EOSC
 someone
 so


unfortunately
 we
 weren't
 able
 to
 uh
 do


the
 equity
 edge
 on
 Twitter
 spaces


yesterday.
 I'm
 sorry
 the
 Twitter
 just


bugged
 out,
 bro.
 Like
 we
 restarted
 it


twice
 and
 people
 couldn't
 pitch
 their


stocks
 but
 uh
 someone
 did
 pitch
 EOS
 last


week
 and
 it
 is
 a
 very
 compelling
 story.


I
 will
 say
 I
 really
 have
 not
 had
 time
 to


go
 into
 it.
 The
 multiple
 is
 expensive
 to


say
 the
 least,
 but
 it's
 one
 of
 those


stocks
 where,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 really


believe
 in
 the
 story,
 multiple
 can't
 be


the
 only
 reason
 you
 don't
 get
 into
 it.


But
 that
 stock
 is
 well
 up
 8.4%.
 Oaklo
 up


5.7%
 and
 then
 SMR
 is
 also
 up
 5.7%.


Energy
 and
 data
 centers
 not
 slowing


down.
 Emit,
 do
 you think
 a
 slight


decrease
 in
 capex
 projections
 is
 coming


from
 the
 data
 I've
 looked
 at?
 because
 I


I
 can't
 have
 an
 opinion
 on
 this
 outside


of
 looking
 at
 the
 reports
 that
 I've
 read


and
 I
 think
 the
 one
 I
 showed
 two
 days


ago
 was
 from
 Morgan
 Stanley.
 No,
 the


answer
 is
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 these


companies
 can
 afford
 to
 do
 a
 slight


decrease.
 I
 think
 Zucks
 literally
 said


today
 we're
 cutting


metaphor
 spending
 to
 spend
 more
 on


capex.
 That's
 not
 confirmed,
 but
 that's


what
 we're
 thinking,
 right?
 So,
 I
 think


the
 capex
 spend
 continues.
 And
 that's


why
 I
 played
 that
 clip
 from
 Daario.
 It's


a
 nuance
 of
 how
 long
 can
 it
 continue
 and


how
 much
 revenue
 can
 you
 give
 attrition


to
 the
 capex
 from
 showing
 that
 it's


actually
 having
 a
 meaningful
 impact.
 And


that's
 a
 really
 tough
 game,
 but
 it's
 a


game
 that
 all
 these
 hyperscalers
 have
 to


play
 as
 the
 S&P
 turns
 green
 on
 the
 day.


So
 until
 we
 get
 a
 real
 report,
 not
 not


the
 the
 information
 putting
 out


nonsense,
 but
 like
 a
 real
 report
 that


says
 Microsoft
 is
 pulling
 back
 spending,


Google's
 pulling
 back
 spending,
 the


spending
 probably


uh
 probably
 continues.
 And
 in
 fact,


speaking
 of
 spending,
 I
 mean,
 this
 is


Sundar
 on
 Fox
 the
 other
 day
 talking


about
 how
 they
 want
 to
 spend
 to
 get
 data


centers
 into
 space.
 I
 mean
 uh
 over
 time


at
 Google
 we're
 always
 proud
 of
 taking


moonsh
 shots.
 You
 mentioned
 Whimo


earlier
 you
 know
 that's
 been
 over
 a


decade
 in
 the
 making.
 We're
 working
 on


quantum
 computing.
 In
 that
 spirit
 one
 of


our
 moonshots
 is
 to
 how
 do
 we
 one
 day


have
 data
 centers
 in
 space
 so
 that
 we


can
 better
 harness
 the
 energy
 from
 the


sun.
 You
 know
 that
 is
 100
 trillion
 times


uh
 more
 energy
 than
 what
 we
 produce
 in


all
 of
 Earth
 today.
 So
 we
 want
 to
 put


these
 data
 centers
 in
 space
 closer
 to


the
 sun
 uh
 and
 and
 I
 think
 we
 are
 taking


our
 first
 step
 in
 27.
 We'll
 send
 tiny
 uh


tiny
 racks
 of
 uh
 machines
 uh
 and
 and


have
 them
 in
 satellites,
 test
 them
 out


and
 then
 start
 scaling
 from
 there.
 But


there's
 no
 doubt
 to
 me
 that
 a
 decade
 or


so
 away
 we'll
 we'll
 we'll
 be
 viewing
 it


as
 a
 more
 normal
 way
 to
 build
 data


centers.


>> Well,
 and
 someone


>> again
 you
 got
 the
 market
 saying,
 "Oh,


this
 is
 a
 bubble."
 And
 then
 Sundar
 is


like,
 "Yeah,
 in
 a
 decade
 it
 will
 be


normal
 to
 have
 operating
 data
 centers
 in


space
 because
 that's
 how
 much
 compute


and
 demand
 we're
 going
 to
 need
 to
 be


able
 to
 make
 AI
 a
 real
 thing."
 I
 mean,


it
 is
 just
 and
 Elon
 has
 echoed
 the
 same


statement
 about
 data
 centers
 in
 space.


So
 has
 Bezos.


So
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 know if
 they're
 just,


you
 know,
 BSing
 about
 it.
 I
 think
 they


legitimately
 feel,
 you
 know,
 Earth
 is


not
 enough
 to
 get
 all
 this
 energy
 and


we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 go
 into
 space.


Speaking
 of
 space
 as
 well,
 Rathon


announced
 a
 strategic
 collaboration
 with


AWS
 to
 improve
 services
 for
 space


customers.


Lot
 of
 space
 headlines
 this
 morning
 and


all
 of
 those
 could
 be
 helping
 Rocket
 Lab


and
 uh
 and
 AMD
 now
 going
 green.
 S&P
 684.


Okay,
 maybe
 we're
 getting
 a
 little
 move


right
 there.
 Nvidia
 182,


that
 one
 going
 green.
 AS
 6957
 13%


on
 the
 day.
 Is
 ETH
 moving?
 Is
 the
 Fusaka


thing
 helping
 us?
 Yeah,
 back
 to
 3200.


Okay,


ETH
 getting
 a
 move.
 Amit,
 will
 you
 cover


a
 rubric
 tonight?
 I
 will
 not
 be
 having
 a


market
 open
 or
 sorry,
 market
 close


tonight.
 Um,
 I
 will
 be
 at
 an
 event
 and


you
 guys
 will
 see
 that
 event
 later


tonight,
 but
 I
 unfortunately
 will
 not
 be


doing
 a
 close.
 So
 Rubric,
 Ulta,
 and


Docyign
 are
 some
 of
 the
 main
 companies


reporting
 today
 along
 with
 Charge
 Point.


Rubric,
 I
 know,
 is
 the
 big
 one
 that


people
 care
 about,
 but
 we'll
 talk
 about


it
 tomorrow
 on
 the


on
 the
 uh
 on
 the
 market
 open.


Ethereum
 right
 there,
 3200o


on
 the
 day.
 Dwave
 as
 well,
 that
 one


having
 a
 great
 move.
 QBTS
 following
 up


from
 yesterday


continues
 to
 move.


Snowflake
 beat
 earnings.
 Yeah,
 dude.
 I
 I


I
 don't
 understand
 why
 Snowflake's
 down.


I
 really
 am
 confused
 about
 that.
 9%


feels
 ridiculous.
 Maybe
 they
 were
 priced


to
 perfection
 up
 60%.
 But
 those
 are
 good


numbers.


Seems
 like
 AI
 is
 being
 a
 catalyst
 for


their
 business.
 So
 it
 is
 weird.


Salesforce
 as
 well
 pretty
 good
 numbers,


but
 Salesforce
 cannot
 get
 a
 meeting.
 I


think
 Ben
 off
 just
 has
 to
 be
 so
 pissed


about
 his
 like
 ban
 off
 is
 one
 of
 those


guys
 who,
 you
 know,
 feels
 that
 he


deserves
 a
 premium
 on
 his
 stock.
 has


been
 delivering
 consistent
 revenue


growth
 for
 like
 20
 years
 at
 this
 point.


They're
 doing
 40
 billion
 in
 revenue,
 but


no
 one
 cares.
 Like,
 no
 one
 cares
 about


Salesforce.
 Maybe
 that's
 where
 the


opportunity
 is,
 but
 this
 year
 it's
 been


where
 the
 opportunity
 cost
 has
 been.


That
 was
 good.
 That
 was
 good.
 See,
 this


is
 that
 was
 like
 maybe
 that's
 where
 the


opportunity
 is,
 but
 this
 year
 that
 was


where
 the
 opportunity
 cost.
 That
 was,
 if


I
 say
 so
 myself,
 that
 was
 quite
 that
 was


a
 that
 was
 a
 quite
 exceptional
 use
 of


vernacular
 in
 the
 heat
 of
 the
 moment.
 I


just
 want
 to
 say
 that
 was
 I
 got
 to
 give


myself
 some
 credit
 on
 that.
 That
 was


that
 was
 pretty
 decent.
 But
 anyway,


Salesforce
 it
 does
 feel
 like
 like
 no
 one


cares
 about
 agent
 force
 even
 though
 it's


growing.
 And
 you
 know,
 for
 the
 people


that
 say
 pounder
 is
 overvalued,
 it's
 too


expensive.
 It's
 like
 well
 people
 care


about
 pounder.
 People
 actually
 care.


Part
 of
 the
 reason
 people
 actually
 care


is
 because
 Karp
 can
 get
 them
 to
 care.


You
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 clips
 from
 Karp
 going


viral
 over
 the
 past
 24
 hours
 as
 he
 was


at
 the
 Deal
 Poke
 Summit.
 And
 uh
 here's
 a


couple
 of
 those
 clips
 and
 what
 he
 said


yesterday
 as
 well.


>> In
 this
 country,
 it
 you
 have
 1%
 of
 the


country
 in
 prison.
 1%
 who
 were
 in
 prison


and
 therefore
 have
 no
 rights.
 Do
 you


know
 what
 happens
 to
 you
 when
 you
 go
 to


prison?
 They
 take
 you
 away
 from
 your


kids.
 You
 know
 who
 that
 happens
 to?


Disproportionately
 workingclass,


disproportionately
 black
 and
 Hispanic


men
 and
 white
 men
 in
 the
 underclass.


Where
 are
 the
 thousands
 of
 articles


about
 them?
 Nobody
 cares.
 And
 they
 don't


care
 because
 it
 does
 not
 either
 serve


the
 ability
 the
 the
 the
 desire
 to
 force


me
 to
 vote
 for
 one
 party,
 which


basically
 takes
 away
 all
 my
 power.


That's
 effectually
 what
 it
 does.
 If
 I


agree
 to
 say
 this
 is
 the
 worst
 thing
 in


the
 world,
 I
 essentially
 have
 given
 up


my
 vote.
 My
 vote
 is
 not
 for
 you.
 My
 vote


is
 for
 these
 two
 issues.


>> Now,
 the
 I
 I
 watched
 the
 entire
 thing


last
 night.
 The
 context
 of
 this
 was


really
 important.
 Karp
 was
 saying,
 you


know,
 Andrew
 asked
 him
 about
 like,
 well,


Karp,
 you
 say
 you're
 a
 Democrat,
 but


you're
 here,
 you
 know,
 publicly
 praising


Trump,
 like
 what's
 going
 on?
 And
 Karp's


like,
 "Look,
 I'm
 pro-choice.
 I
 believe


that
 women
 should
 have
 the
 right
 to
 have


an
 abortion,
 but
 that's
 not
 my
 number


one
 issue.
 And
 so,
 am
 I
 going
 to
 be


indebted
 to
 the
 Democratic
 party
 because


they're
 pro-choice
 versus
 pro-life,
 or


am
 I
 going
 to
 say
 my
 number
 one
 and
 two


issue,
 which
 is
 not
 pro-choice,
 will


elevate
 a
 different
 political
 party
 for


my
 vote.
 And
 I
 and
 I
 think
 that
 the


broader
 sort
 of
 um
 sovereign


individualistic
 argument
 that
 that
 this


entire
 country
 is
 based
 on
 is
 that
 you


have
 the
 freedom,
 the
 ability,
 no
 matter


who
 you
 are,
 to
 cast
 your
 opinion


because
 your
 opinion
 is
 treated
 as
 an


equal
 opinion
 to
 everyone
 else.
 a
 hedge


fund
 manager
 gets
 to
 vote
 for
 in
 the


election
 and
 so
 does
 someone
 who
 is,
 you


know,
 making
 $40,000
 a
 year.
 Their
 votes


matter.
 And
 so
 Carp's
 argument
 is
 like


you
 can't
 say
 my
 vote
 has
 to
 go
 to
 the


Democrats
 just
 because
 I
 believe
 in
 some


things
 uh
 and
 they
 believe
 in
 other


things
 if
 I
 have
 other
 agendas
 that
 that


I
 care
 about.


>> The
 second
 reason
 they
 don't
 care
 is


because
 somehow
 no
 one
 has
 empathy
 with


any
 of
 those
 people
 because
 no
 one
 none


of
 us
 really
 deal
 with
 those
 people.
 At


Palunteer,
 we
 are
 on
 the
 side
 of


workingclass
 Americans.
 We
 support


people
 who
 go
 to
 the
 military.
 We
 save


their
 lives.
 We
 bring
 them
 home
 safer.


Our
 AI
 actually
 makes
 workers
 more


wealthy,
 more
 valuable.
 And
 the
 10
 to
 15


million
 people
 that
 love
 me
 despite


what's
 written,
 half
 of
 them
 made
 a
 lot


of
 money
 on
 us.
 And
 you
 know what


they're
 like?
 They're
 like
 people
 like


me
 who
 think,
 you
 know what,
 we
 have
 to


do
 better.
 Of
 course,
 we
 have
 to
 do


better.


>> And
 then
 this
 was
 Karp
 speaking
 about


everyone
 saying
 that
 he
 shifted
 his


political
 party.
 corrupt
 you


immediately.
 I
 didn't
 shift
 my
 politics.


The
 political
 parties
 have
 shifted
 their


politics.
 The
 the
 idea
 that
 what's
 being


called
 progressive
 is
 in
 any
 way


progressive
 is
 a
 complete
 farce.
 I've


been
 progressive
 since
 the
 beginning
 of


Palunteer.
 I'm
 continue
 to
 be
 I
 grew
 up


in
 a
 highly
 intellectually
 intellectual


mostly
 Jewish
 incredibly
 left-wing


environment.
 And
 every
 Saturday
 and


every
 Friday,
 I
 heard
 a
 lecture
 about


how
 the
 conservatives
 are
 going
 to


destroy
 this
 country
 with
 illegal


immigration
 because
 it's
 going
 to


undermine
 the
 fabric
 of
 the
 American


worker.
 That
 was
 50
 years
 ago.
 That's


what
 it
 be
 means
 to
 be
 a
 progressive.


Being
 a
 progressive
 doesn't
 mean
 just,


oh,
 I
 oh,
 it
 feels
 so
 good
 to
 be


involved
 in
 dysfunction,
 things
 that
 can


never
 work,
 a
 form
 of
 socialism
 that's


never
 worked,
 having
 no
 meritocracy.


That's
 not
 progressive.
 That's
 pretend.


That's
 honestly
 cowardly.
 And
 most


people
 on
 very
 half
 my
 old
 party
 knows


it.
 They
 don't
 speak
 up.
 It's
 [ __ ]


It
 will
 never
 work.
 And
 it
 does
 not


help.
 You
 know,
 the
 biggest
 problem
 with


that
 is
 it's
 not
 helping
 the
 poor
 people


that
 they
 claim
 to
 hurt.
 If
 you
 think


that's
 helping
 a
 black
 person
 in
 the


inner
 city,
 you're
 ridiculous.
 The
 last


thing
 anyone
 in
 this
 country
 needs
 is
 a


dysfunctional
 educational
 system
 and


handouts
 that
 have
 never
 worked
 and
 are


not
 going
 to
 work.
 Okay,
 let
 me


interrupt
 Jimmy.


So
 you
 had
 Karp
 making
 his
 argument
 and


making
 his
 case
 at
 that
 summit
 and
 you


know
 ultimately
 these
 are
 the
 things


that
 he
 has
 believed
 in
 for
 a
 while
 now


and
 as
 his
 public
 persona
 and
 public


brand
 continues
 to
 grow
 so
 does
 the


distribution
 of
 his
 ideas.
 It's
 kind
 of


crazy.
 Karp
 had
 a
 pretty
 big
 interview


yesterday
 at
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 and


Jensen
 had
 a
 big
 interview
 with
 Joe


Rogan.


uh
 just
 the
 age
 of
 these
 CEOs


elevating
 their
 voices
 based
 on
 the


distribution
 of
 their
 their
 ideas


because
 everyone
 cares
 about
 what
 they


have
 to
 say
 because
 they're
 running


these
 companies
 that
 are
 the
 most


important
 companies
 in
 the
 world
 is


pretty
 incredible
 to
 see
 Nvidia
 right


there
 183
 broke
 out
 to
 a
 high
 of
 day


183


let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 this
 thing
 to


185
 again
 I
 did
 buy
 more
 Nvidia


yesterday
 at
 180
 I
 know
 I
 bought
 at
 170


a
 week
 ago
 but
 it
 really
 is
 not
 making


sense
 sense
 to
 me
 why
 after
 those


earnings
 this
 thing
 is
 stuck


and
 I'm
 not
 saying
 it
 has
 to
 go
 to
 220


or
 230
 anytime
 soon
 but
 I
 think
 closer


to
 195
 it
 should
 be
 at
 based
 on
 those


earnings
 meta
 still
 holding
 the
 4%
 move


AMD

 caner

 this
 is

Bitcoin
 treasury
 right
 C
 is
 this
 Jack


Mer's
 thing


this
 is
 up
 24%


I
 think
 it
 has
 to
 do
 with
 uh
 Caner


Fitzgerald


But


I
 believe
 that
 one
 is
 a
 Bitcoin
 name
 and


that
 one's
 up
 about
 20%.
 Brandon,
 thanks


for
 the
 super
 chat.
 I'm
 making
 you
 check


out
 AMBA
 and
 AEHR
 next
 phases
 in
 the
 AIS


to
 build
 out
 the
 SIC
 and
 chip
 quality


testing
 inference
 opportunities
 in


drones,
 AVs,
 and
 security
 cameras.
 You


know,
 AEHR
 is
 something
 that
 Roy
 really


likes.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 like
 almost
 two


to
 three%
 of
 his
 portfolio
 if
 I'm
 not


wrong.
 So
 yes,
 I
 can
 definitely
 look


into
 those
 names.
 I
 will
 write
 those


down.
 But
 Roy
 has
 a
 bunch
 of
 videos
 on


his
 channel
 about
 AEHR
 as
 he
 thinks


that's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 one


going
 further
 as
 well.
 BMR

 a
 move


on


the
 day
 as

BMR
 up
 2%.


And
 that's
 moving
 higher.
 Wow.
 AS
 14%.


My
 goodness,
 this
 one
 not
 stopping.
 70


bucks.
 Back
 to
 70.


Back
 to
 70
 for
 ESTS.


I
 ren
 are
 we
 pumping?
 We
 all
 know
 why.


We
 all
 know
 who
 said
 to
 buy
 Salesforce


and
 sell
 Irene
 yesterday.


So


sometimes
 when
 you
 get
 the
 Kramer


signal,
 you
 get
 a
 move.
 Again,
 this
 is


the
 thing
 about
 Kramer
 that's
 so
 like


you
 would
 think
 after
 40
 years,
 he
 would


have
 realized
 when
 a
 stock
 has
 a
 massive


downturn,
 you
 don't
 say
 to
 sell
 because


you're
 just
 going
 to
 look
 dumb
 because


if
 it's
 somewhat
 of
 a
 high
 quality


company,
 it
 doesn't
 even
 have
 to
 be
 an


amazing
 just
 somewhat
 of
 a
 decent


company.
 Usually
 after
 a
 15
 20%
 draw


down
 like
 the
 bleeding
 stops
 unless
 the


company
 is
 absolute
 [ __ ]
 garbage
 which


there
 are
 some
 of
 those
 names
 in
 the


market
 that
 still
 recover
 after
 a
 20%


draw
 down
 like
 you
 tend
 to
 get
 a
 bounce


even
 if
 it's
 a
 small
 bounce
 and
 every


time
 he
 sees
 this
 like
 he's
 like
 the


retail
 investor
 like
 the
 epitome
 of
 the


retail
 investor
 that
 doesn't
 know


anything
 because
 as
 soon
 as
 a
 stock
 goes


down
 he's
 like
 all right
 it's
 time
 to


sell.
 It's
 like,
 no,
 no,
 no.
 That's
 when


you
 wait.
 Maybe
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 buy,


but
 you
 definitely
 don't
 sell
 at
 the


lows.
 Aren
 was
 down
 20%
 over
 the
 past


three
 days
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 sell
 it.


That
 doesn't
 make
 And
 then
 he
 And
 then


he
 looks
 dumb
 because
 then
 it
 pumps


because
 yeah,
 like
 if
 it's
 a
 somewhat
 of


a
 quality
 company,
 people
 are
 going
 to


buy
 that
 dip


and
 it
 doesn't
 make
 any
 sense.
 So
 you


got
 I
 ren
 moving
 right
 there
 up
 2.5%.


Pounder
 at
 176
 BMR
 3428.
 Oh,
 we
 got
 a


some
 coverage
 on
 this
 Netflix
 Warner


Brothers
 move.
 Let's
 pull
 up
 some
 of


this
 analysis
 right
 here.
 I
 really
 do


think
 it
 would
 be
 bullish
 for
 Netflix,


but
 there's
 also
 regulatory
 hurdles
 to


even
 get
 the
 deal
 completed.


So
 let's
 hear
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 how
 this


might
 end
 up
 playing
 out.


>> Should
 send
 alarm
 to
 antitrust
 enforcers


around
 the
 world.
 He
 says,
 "If
 it
 were


to
 materialize,
 it
 would
 raise
 serious


competition
 questions,
 perhaps
 more
 so


than
 any
 transaction
 I've
 seen
 in
 about


a
 decade."
 He
 said,
 "When
 Netflix
 has


real
 competition,
 viewers
 and
 artists


win.
 Increasing
 their
 dominance
 this
 way


would
 mean
 the
 end
 of
 the
 golden
 age
 of


streaming
 for
 content
 uh
 creators
 and


consumers."
 So,
 you
 saying
 you
 agree


with
 him?


>> I
 say
 I
 agree
 with
 him.
 I
 think
 uh


Senator
 Lee's
 a
 a
 very
 skilled
 antitrust


lawyer.
 He
 was
 chair
 of
 the
 antitrust


subcommittee
 during
 my
 tenure
 at
 DOJ.
 We


saw
 eye
 to
 eye
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 issues.
 Um,
 I


think
 this
 is
 one
 where
 we
 probably
 view


it
 through
 the
 same
 lens.
 Um,
 it
 reminds


me
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 situation
 that
 I


confronted
 at
 DOJ
 with
 Spirit
 JetBlue,


where
 Spirit
 was
 in
 negotiations
 with


Frontier,
 uh,
 and
 then
 JetBlue
 came
 in


with
 a
 much
 higher
 bid.
 Uh,
 a
 lot
 of


folks,
 including
 Spirit's
 own


management,
 said
 that
 the
 deal
 would


raise
 antitrust
 concerns,
 but


shareholders
 persuaded
 Spirit
 to
 take


the
 premium
 from
 JetBlue
 and
 abandon
 the


deal
 with
 Frontier.
 As
 a
 result,
 they


found
 themselves
 in
 the
 antitrust


crosshairs
 and
 the
 deal
 got
 blocked
 and


everyone
 was
 worse
 off.
 So,
 if
 you're


Warner
 right
 now,
 you
 have
 to
 think
 very


carefully
 about
 um
 one,
 whether
 you
 need


to
 merge
 with
 anyone.
 Uh
 which
 I'm
 happy


to
 discuss
 because
 if
 you
 think
 about


Warner,
 it's
 frankly
 not
 done
 well
 every


time
 someone
 buys
 it.
 Um
 going


[laughter]
 back
 to
 the
 AOL
 days,
 right?


It's
 like
 the
 ring
 from
 Lord
 of
 the


Rings.
 It's
 my
 precious.
 Anyone
 who


touches
 it
 seems
 to
 struggle
 with
 it.


But
 but but
 beyond
 that,
 you
 have
 to


think
 about
 um
 you
 know
 what
 am
 I
 what


kind
 of
 risk
 am
 I
 taking
 here?
 Is
 it


really
 worth
 the
 premium
 to
 to
 incur


that
 risk?


>> What
 but
 Jonathan
 though
 does
 the
 board


of
 Warner
 have
 that
 luxury
 of
 saying
 hey


maybe
 we
 can
 go
 it
 alone.
 We
 have
 three


bids
 on
 the
 table.
 The
 stocks
 responded


shareholder
 duty
 would
 imply
 that
 they


need
 to
 maximize
 you
 know
 value
 if
 you


do
 have
 uh
 some
 reliable
 bid
 out
 there.


>> Yeah.
 Isn't
 that
 the
 Revlon
 case?


>> No.
 that
 is
 that
 is
 the
 challenge
 they


face
 which
 is
 why
 they're
 you
 know
 they


need
 a
 strong
 base
 case
 for
 go
 it
 alone


but
 I
 do
 think
 that
 there's
 you
 know


history
 here
 which
 is
 that
 the
 assets


really
 have
 not
 thrive
 let's
 do
 a
 poll


right
 here
 see
 what
 people
 think
 do
 you


think
 Netflix
 ends
 up
 buying
 Warner


Brothers
 I
 just
 think
 it
 would
 be
 such
 a


massive
 move
 in
 the
 media
 world
 but
 it


might
 take
 years
 for
 it
 to
 even


materialize
 because
 yeah
 the
 regulators


unless
 Trump
 tells
 the
 the
 FTC
 to
 just


let
 it
 happen.
 Uh,
 which
 is
 possible.


I
 It
 would
 end
 up
 getting
 held
 up
 in


court.


I
 don't
 know
 why
 Amazon's
 down.
 It's


confusing
 to
 say
 the
 least.
 This
 one
 has


been
 stuck.


Dude,
 this
 was
 at
 238
 yesterday.
 Like


228
 is


I
 don't
 know.
 It's
 weird,
 dude.
 End
 of


the
 year
 Amazon
 selling.
 I
 mean,
 it's


barely
 had
 a
 year
 to
 begin
 with
 and


still
 getting
 hit.


>> Not
 sure.
 I
 don't
 see
 the
 headline


either.
 I
 mean,
 Rosenblat,
 they
 came
 out


today.
 They
 said,
 "Hey,
 price
 target


305."


Um,
 analyst
 sees
 AWS
 growth
 as


sustainable
 post
 reinvent
 with
 valuation


supported
 by
 20%
 ebida
 through
 2027.


Don't
 see
 any
 downgrades
 coming
 in,


but
 stocks
 still
 getting
 hit
 right
 here.


I
 don't
 know if
 it's
 good
 for
 Netflix
 to


buy
 Warner
 Brothers.
 Makes
 more
 sense


for
 Paramount
 to
 buy
 them.
 Not
 sure
 if


it's
 good
 for
 Netflix.
 They
 should
 not


change
 their
 business
 model.
 Well,
 they


wouldn't
 be
 buying
 the
 TV
 stations.
 They


would
 be
 just
 buying
 the
 streaming
 like


the
 HBO
 Max,
 the
 DC,
 all
 that
 stuff.
 But


like
 even
 then
 it
 would
 still
 incur
 a


lot
 of
 debt
 for
 them.
 Um
 my
 thing
 is


just
 like
 Netflix
 needs
 new
 content.


Like
 they
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 they
 can
 keep


coming
 up
 with
 Stranger
 Things.
 Like


it's
 easier
 to
 get
 friends.
 Like
 so
 many


people
 just
 want
 to
 watch
 Friends.


So
 many
 people
 discovered
 The
 Office


because
 it
 was
 on
 Netflix
 in
 2015
 and


now
 it's
 on
 Peacock.
 So
 just
 being
 able


to
 own
 those
 assets
 from
 an
 IP
 level


is
 important.
 Yeah,
 Chris
 is
 right.


Eventually
 Tranium
 is
 going
 to
 have
 a


major
 impact
 on
 AWS
 as
 well,
 which
 I


think
 is
 a


massive
 bullcase
 for
 Amazon.
 The
 1.1


million
 layoffs
 I
 don't
 think
 is
 causing


any
 like
 broad
 pressure
 on
 the
 stock


market
 today.
 That
 news
 has
 kind
 of


already
 been
 baked
 in.
 It's
 just
 a
 very


important
 stat
 for
 everyone
 to
 remember


that
 since
 2020,
 we
 have
 not
 had
 1.1


million
 layoffs.
 But
 the
 takeaway
 from


that
 is
 the
 labor
 market's
 weak.
 And


you
 know,
 as
 a
 result
 of
 the
 labor


market
 being
 weak,
 the
 Fed
 probably


is
 going
 to
 need
 to
 cut.
 Here's
 a
 little


bit
 more
 coverage
 right
 there
 on


the
 labor
 market,


but
 it
 all
 but
 confirms
 this
 rate
 cut


probably
 ends
 up
 happening.
 Challenger


numbers,
 which
 we
 have
 been
 watching


with
 increased
 focus,
 especially
 since


we
 haven't
 gotten
 a
 jobs
 report,
 a


monthly
 jobs
 report,
 showed
 that


employers
 announced
 71,321


layoffs
 last
 month.
 This
 is
 according
 to


the
 the
 job
 placement
 firm
 Challenger


Grand
 Christmas.
 And
 it
 is
 a
 24%
 jump


from
 the
 planned
 layoffs
 in
 November


2024,
 so
 a
 year
 earlier.
 that
 that


challenger
 data
 has
 continued
 to
 point


to
 elevated
 layoffs
 and
 is
 seen
 as


problematic
 for
 the
 labor
 market.
 On
 the


plus
 side,
 we
 got
 the
 government
 jobless


claims,
 the
 number
 of
 Americans
 filing


for
 unemployment
 claims
 in
 the
 last


week.
 And
 keep
 in
 mind,
 it
 includes


Thanksgiving,
 so
 it
 could
 be
 exaggerated


by
 that,
 but
 it's
 historically
 very
 low.


And
 that
 is
 a
 good
 sign
 for
 the
 overall


labor
 market.
 Sort
 of
 contrary
 to
 what


we
 just
 heard,
 191,000
 Americans
 filing


for
 new
 unemployment
 claims.
 That
 is
 the


lowest
 level
 since
 September
 2022.
 It


speaks
 to
 the
 no
 hiring,
 no
 firing


economy.
 Again,
 if
 you
 saw
 mass
 layoffs,


you
 would
 see
 this
 number
 go
 up
 because


more
 Americans
 would
 be
 filing
 for


unemployment
 claims.
 We're
 just
 not


seeing
 that
 in
 the
 data.
 I
 don't
 know.


>> So,
 that's
 the
 that's
 the
 dichotomy,


right?
 Like,
 it's
 this
 no
 fire,
 no


higher
 labor
 market,
 and
 I
 think
 that's


one
 of the
 better
 ways
 to
 describe
 it.


You
 should
 be
 seeing
 way
 more
 people


file
 for
 unemployment
 if
 we're
 seeing


mass
 layoffs,


which
 means
 we're
 seeing
 layoffs.
 They


might
 just
 not
 be
 mass
 layoffs.
 Now,


what's
 the
 case
 with
 the
 rate
 cut?
 The


rate
 cut
 hopefully
 comes
 in
 before
 they


become
 mass
 layoffs,


but
 the
 rate
 cuts
 also
 help
 the
 equity


market.
 So,
 that
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 spot


we're
 in
 going
 into
 2026.
 And
 I
 think


it's
 actually
 a
 really
 good
 spot
 to
 be


in
 it.
 you
 know,
 the
 bears
 claiming
 doom


and
 gloom,
 the
 consumer's
 dead,
 layoffs,


recession,
 yada
 yada.
 It's
 like
 you're


just
 not
 seeing
 the
 data
 to
 identify


that.
 And
 maybe,
 you
 know,
 there's
 a


blind
 spot
 in
 the
 data
 and
 eventually


that's
 going
 to
 happen.
 But
 if
 we're


looking
 at
 the
 data,
 we
 don't
 see
 that


for
 the
 bulls
 saying
 everything
 is


perfect.
 Don't
 worry
 about
 it.
 That's


also
 not
 true.
 But
 the
 nuance
 in
 the


middle
 is
 more
 bullish
 than
 bearish


because
 you
 get
 the
 rate
 cut
 to
 stop
 the


labor
 market
 from
 getting
 that
 bad
 and


the
 rate
 cut
 ends
 up
 supporting
 equity


prices
 as
 well.
 So,
 I
 think
 it's
 not
 a


horrible
 setup
 at
 all
 going
 into


going
 into
 uh
 2026.


And
 I
 I
 think
 it
 makes
 more
 sense
 than


not.


Um


S&P
 right
 there
 683


basically
 flat
 on
 the
 day,
 not
 moving


too
 much.
 Swan,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super


chat.
 What
 did
 Jason
 say
 about
 Hood


reaching
 135?
 Will
 it
 go
 up
 or
 down?
 Uh


Jason
 said
 hood
 consolidating
 between


120
 to
 135
 is
 bullish.
 He
 doesn't
 see


the
 150s
 happening
 again
 as
 easily.
 He


thinks
 it's
 possible,
 but
 he
 also
 thinks


below
 120
 would
 be
 a
 buy
 the
 dip.
 So


realistically
 that
 120
 to
 135
 range
 is


pretty
 strong.
 Now
 if
 we
 close
 above


135,
 he
 did
 say
 on
 Tuesday,
 then
 that's


really
 bullish.
 But,
 you
 know,
 question


is,
 does
 that
 close
 above
 135
 get
 us
 to


the
 uh
 the
 150s?


Uh,
 do
 a
 poll
 and
 see
 if
 people
 are


having
 layoffs
 at
 their
 current
 jobs.


That
 is
 a
 good
 poll
 question.
 So,
 let's


do
 that
 poll.
 65%
 of
 you,
 by
 the
 way,


said
 that
 Netflix
 will
 buy
 Warner


Brothers.


So,
 let's
 do
 a
 poll
 right
 here.
 By
 the


way,
 Hims
 is
 launching
 in
 Canada
 today.


Hims
 is
 launching
 in
 Canada
 today.
 See


the
 headline
 right
 here.
 Hims
 is


launching.
 Hims
 and
 hers
 officially


launching


in
 Canada
 today.
 Maybe
 that's
 why
 the


stock
 is
 up
 5%
 as
 well.
 Do
 you
 have


layoffs
 happening
 where
 you
 work?


Okay,
 so
 that
 is
 a
 question.
 Are
 you


seeing
 layoffs


at
 your
 employer?


And
 you
 know,
 I
 would
 imagine
 there's


definitely
 some
 people
 that
 are
 seeing


that
 happen.
 I
 mean,
 I
 know
 a
 couple
 of


you
 work
 for
 Amazon,
 so
 quite
 literally,


you're
 seeing
 some
 of
 that
 stuff
 take


place,


and
 Amazon
 was
 the
 big
 one
 last
 month


with
 30,000.


Draco
 says,
 "No
 layoffs.
 We
 are
 hiring."


Um,
 some
 people
 said,
 "We
 did
 last


month."


Scoozie
 says,
 "I'm
 a
 small
 business,


just
 hired
 three
 new
 employees."


Dove
 says,
 "No
 layoffs.
 We're
 hiring."


Wow,
 actually
 more
 people
 saying
 hiring


than
 not.


Someone
 says
 yes
 because
 I
 work
 for
 the


federal
 government.
 Dude,
 Doge,
 remember


when
 we
 all
 thought
 Doge
 was
 going
 to
 be


a
 thing?


I
 Dude,
 I
 was
 I
 was
 a
 cheerleader
 for


Doge.
 I
 I
 really
 thought
 the
 idea
 made


sense.
 I
 really
 thought
 they
 were
 going


to
 make
 this
 government
 more
 efficient.


That
 [ __ ]
 didn't
 happen.


That
 [ __ ]
 did
 not
 happen.


thought
 it
 had
 a
 shot.


Elon
 tried.
 I
 really
 do
 think
 he
 tried.


Tesla's
 stock
 got
 hit
 in
 half
 while
 he


was
 trying,
 but
 Tesla
 literally
 went


from
 freaking
 488
 in
 December
 of
 2024
 to


March.
 It
 was
 at
 what,
 210?
 Yeah.


Basically
 lost
 50%.
 That's
 when
 Elon
 was


in
 the
 thick
 of
 it
 when
 it
 came
 to
 Doge.


And
 that
 just
 didn't
 end
 up
 playing
 out.


Um,


grab
 right
 there
 at
 526.


Rocket
 Lab
 7%
 day
 backtoback
 big
 days
 on


Rocket
 Lab
 and
 ESTS
 as
 that
 stock
 is
 now


up
 14%


on
 the
 day.


I
 want
 Elon
 to
 try
 again
 so
 I
 can
 buy


the
 Tesla
 dip.
 Dude,
 do
 we
 think
 Tesla


holds
 400
 next
 year?
 Do
 Do
 we
 think
 like


Tesla


holds
 400?
 60%
 of
 you
 said
 no.
 you
 do


not
 see
 layoffs
 happening
 where
 you


work?


I'll
 put
 that
 question
 in
 the
 chat.
 Does


Tesla


hold
 400
 in
 2026?
 Hold
 meaning
 like
 it


could
 dip
 below
 it
 here
 and
 there,
 but


it's
 not
 meaningfully
 going
 to
 dip
 and


stay
 below
 400.


Like,
 do
 we
 think
 it
 has
 a
 shot
 to


actually
 sustain
 that
 level?
 Because
 we,


as
 for
 Elon,
 there's
 not
 going to
 be


earnings
 growth
 until
 the
 earliest
 Q3
 of


next
 year.
 But
 now
 that
 he
 has
 his


compensation
 package,
 now
 you
 know
 he


bought
 a
 billion
 of
 stock
 at
 385.
 Maybe


the
 market


maybe
 the
 market
 doesn't
 care


if
 robo
 taxi
 keeps
 happening.
 I
 see
 500.


I
 think
 we
 will
 definitely
 have
 to
 get
 a


lot
 of
 uh


a
 lot
 of
 progress
 on
 that
 in
 a
 in
 a
 more


meaningful
 way


to
 make
 it
 become
 a
 thing.


Dude,
 thank
 you
 for
 everyone
 who's
 been


sending
 me
 these
 screenshots
 as
 well.
 It


it
 definitely
 is
 very
 humbling.
 Shout


out
 to
 Michelle.
 I
 just
 saw
 her
 tweet


and
 a
 bunch
 of
 you
 guys
 tweeted.
 But
 um


yeah,
 YouTube
 did
 this
 wrapped
 feature.


I
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 great
 idea
 because


Spotify
 did
 it
 for
 like
 five
 years
 and


this
 is
 the
 first
 time
 YouTube
 did
 it


and
 uh
 yeah,
 a
 bunch
 of
 you
 guys
 have


been
 tagging
 me
 as
 like
 your
 top


channel.
 You
 guys
 want
 to
 know
 my
 top


channel?
 I
 couldn't
 believe
 this
 [ __ ]


when
 I
 saw
 it.
 I
 really
 couldn't
 believe


it
 when
 I
 I
 was
 like
 I
 didn't
 think
 I


like
 this
 guy
 this
 much,
 but
 I
 guess
 I


do.
 I
 say
 this
 as
 one
 of
 his
 top
 stocks


that
 he
 talks
 about
 is
 ripping
 at
 the


moment.
 BMNR,


look
 at
 that
 4%
 move
 right
 there
 as


Ethereum
 continuing
 to
 move.


Freaking
 Tanner
 was
 my
 first
 channel.
 I


couldn't
 believe
 it.
 I
 was
 like,
 do
 I


watch
 Tanner
 that
 much?
 I
 don't
 know
 how


ESPN
 got
 in
 there.
 Like
 I
 don't
 even


think
 I'm
 that
 big
 of
 a
 sports
 guy.
 CNBC


obviously
 the
 compound.
 I
 mean
 I
 watched


their
 podcast
 once
 a
 week.
 I
 don't
 think


it
 was
 like
 my
 top
 channel.


And
 then
 Steve,
 of
 course
 he
 ended
 Steve


started
 his
 channel
 literally
 a
 month


ago
 and
 he
 became
 my
 top
 five.
 But
 this


was
 confusing
 to
 me
 because
 I
 was
 like
 I


thought
 I
 watch
 a
 lot
 of
 variety
 on


YouTube.
 I
 guess
 I
 don't.
 I
 guess
 like


you
 know
 that's
 the
 beautiful
 thing


about
 like
 the
 way
 the
 algorithm
 works


and
 like
 building
 a
 community
 on
 the


platform.
 It's
 like
 sometimes
 people


just
 have
 a
 routine
 and
 I
 guess
 Tanner's


part
 of
 my
 routine.
 Steve's
 part
 of
 my


routine.
 CNBC
 is
 obviously
 part
 of
 my


routine
 and
 that
 ends
 up
 being
 to
 your


go-to
 every
 day.


But
 I
 couldn't
 believe
 it,
 bro.
 Cuz
 like


I'm
 definitely
 not
 Tanner's
 top
 channel.


So,
 it's
 this
 like
 weird
 like
 it's
 this


weird
 like
 like
 you
 know
 like
 you
 know


when
 you're
 in
 a
 relationship
 with


someone
 and
 like
 like
 you
 like
 them
 more


than
 they
 like
 you
 and
 it's
 it's
 kind
 of


like
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 like
 this
 like


cuz
 I'm
 definitely
 not
 his
 top
 channel


and
 I
 just
 feel
 like


I
 feel
 like
 I'm
 I'm
 giving
 too
 much
 and


I'm
 not
 getting
 enough
 in
 in
 return.
 So,


it's
 kind
 of
 weird,
 dude.
 It's
 kind
 of


freaking
 weird.
 But
 Mr.
 Tanner
 is
 my
 top


channel
 pounder
 right
 there
 176
 Bloom


Energy
 9%
 on
 Bloom.


Look
 at
 that.
 That's
 moving
 today.


Oaklo's
 up
 10
 and
 then
 Nvidia
 181
 up


1.2%
 on
 the
 day.


Okay,
 this
 is
 a
 good
 com.
 He's
 your
 top


and
 you're
 his
 bottom.
 That's
 that's


that's
 I'm
 not
 beating
 the
 allegations


on
 that
 one,
 but
 that's
 that's
 that
 was


a
 funny
 one.
 That
 was
 a
 funny
 one.


Tanner
 just
 doesn't
 want
 to
 admit
 how


much
 he
 loves
 you.
 Admit
 we
 got
 to
 see


Tanner's
 daily
 recap.
 His
 like
 YouTube


recap.
 I
 want
 to
 see
 who
 Tanner's
 top


channel
 is.
 I
 am
 curious
 now.


Cuz
 I
 sent
 this
 screenshot
 to
 Tanner


yesterday
 and
 he
 didn't
 respond
 with
 his


screenshot.
 So
 to
 me,
 I'm
 like,
 he's


definitely
 cheating
 on
 me,
 dude.
 Because


like
 I
 sent
 him
 the
 screenshot
 thinking


he
 would
 respond
 with
 his
 screenshot
 and


I'd
 be
 like,
 "Oh,
 cool."
 Like
 we
 both


watch
 each
 other.
 But
 I
 guess
 he's


watching
 something
 else
 on
 YouTube,


dude.
 I
 guess
 he's
 watching
 something


else.
 All right,
 guys.
 That
 is
 it
 for


me.
 I'm
 out.
 Uh
 I
 will
 be
 in
 an
 event


today
 in
 New
 York
 City,
 so
 that's
 why
 we


will
 not
 have
 the
 market
 close,
 but
 uh
 I


will
 be
 tweeting
 about
 it
 later


throughout
 the
 day,
 so
 you
 guys
 will
 see


it.
 And
 um
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


It's
 pretty
 much
 the
 end
 of
 the
 week,


which
 is
 kind
 of
 crazy
 that
 we
 are


already
 near
 the
 first


uh
 weekend
 of
 December,
 but
 nonetheless,


that's
 where
 we
 are.
 Nvidia
 up
 181
 1%
 of


the
 day.
 Pounder,
 Invidia
 Partnership


was
 a
 big
 deal
 today.
 Um
 Nvidia
 right


there
 181,
 poundry
 at
 176.
 Robin
 Hood


13471.
 Meta
 big
 news
 as
 well
 for
 them
 to


cut
 the
 metaverse
 potentially.
 That's
 up


4%.
 Shout
 out
 to
 Chris.
 He
 deserves
 the


gains
 on
 this
 one.
 I
 ran
 that's
 up
 2%.


Salesforce
 up
 1.43.


Um
 you
 got
 Amazon
 which
 again
 is
 down


even
 further
 227
 not
 sure
 why
 that's


happening.
 Space
 Mob
 congrats
 big
 day
 as


Rocket
 Lab.
 And
 then
 you
 have
 the
 S&P


500
 at
 68279.


Robinet
 at
 134
 and
 then
 pounding
 right


here
 at
 176.22


on
 the
 day.


All right,
 that's
 it
 for
 me.
 Thank
 you.


Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being


here.
 We'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow


uh
 and
 we
 will
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


Emit,
 you
 are
 number
 four
 in
 my
 top


channels.
 I
 appreciate
 it.
 For
 everyone


who
 sent
 me
 the
 screenshot,
 I
 I
 really


really
 deeply
 do
 appreciate
 it,
 man.


It's
 it's
 very
 humbling
 to
 be
 part
 of


someone's
 rotation
 and
 be
 part
 of
 uh
 you


know,
 their
 daily
 routine
 and
 I
 do
 not


take
 it
 for
 granted.
 And
 um
 yeah,
 it's


just
 cool.
 You
 know,
 sometimes
 you


develop
 a
 routine
 with
 a
 creator
 and


you're
 there
 every
 single
 day
 and
 it's


just
 part
 of
 your
 your
 your
 workflow
 and


it's
 very
 very
 very
 humbling
 throughout


the
 day
 whether
 you
 guys
 are
 working
 or


with
 the
 kids
 or
 driving
 for
 me
 to
 be
 in


the
 background
 be
 part
 of
 your
 daily


lives.
 I
 I
 deeply
 deeply
 appreciate
 it


and
 hopefully
 I
 can
 just
 keep
 bringing


more
 value
 on
 the
 show.
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of


plans
 for
 2026
 uh
 that
 I
 think
 can


accelerate
 it
 to
 a
 new
 level.


Have
 a
 lot
 of
 interviews
 that
 have
 been


starting
 to
 line
 up
 for
 2026.
 Uh,
 some


are
 big,
 some
 are
 big
 but
 not
 huge,
 and


then
 some
 are
 in
 the
 are
 in
 the
 ballpark


of
 potentially
 being
 massive.
 So,


working
 really,
 really
 hard
 to
 see
 if
 we


can
 materialize
 these
 things
 and
 just


get
 more
 people
 on
 the
 channel.
 And
 I


think
 it'll
 be
 fun
 and
 we're
 going
 to


keep
 going.
 We're
 going
 to
 keep
 going


into
 2026.


All right,
 word
 of
 the
 day.
 Let's
 do


this
 right
 here.
 Again,
 we
 are
 on
 these


finance
 word
 of
 the
 days.
 We
 can
 do
 a


different
 prompt
 later,
 but
 I
 think
 like


every
 week
 we
 can
 do
 a
 certain
 prompt


that
 can
 uh
 that
 can
 get
 these
 different


word
 of
 the
 days.
 Amid
 is
 my
 work
 from


home
 workmate.
 Yeah,
 basically
 all


[laughter]
 we
 are
 all
 work
 from


homemates


together.
 Like
 dude,
 I
 was
 my
 sister


took
 off
 yesterday
 and
 she
 was
 spending


uh
 my
 cousin's
 leaving
 to
 California


later
 today
 and
 my
 sister's
 been
 off
 to


my
 sister
 she
 said
 she
 was
 feeling
 sick


and
 she's
 you
 know
 she
 just
 wanted
 to


relax
 and
 uh
 I
 went
 home
 last
 night
 and


I
 just
 saw
 her
 laying
 down
 watching
 TV


and
 I
 was
 like
 bro
 and
 so
 was
 my
 cousin.


And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Bro,
 we
 for
 4
 days
 from


Thursday
 to
 Sunday
 last
 week
 over


Thanksgiving,
 all
 three
 of
 us
 just
 sat


on
 the
 couch
 and
 just
 chilled
 and
 we


watched
 movies
 and
 ate
 junk
 food
 and
 all


this
 stuff.
 You
 both
 are
 acting
 like


you're
 on
 vacation
 again."
 So,
 I
 was


giving
 them
 a
 hard
 time.
 I
 was
 like,


"It's
 not
 time
 for
 vacation,
 bro.
 We
 got


to
 get
 to
 work."
 Like,
 I
 I
 did
 like


three
 podcasts
 yesterday,
 two
 live


streams,
 Twitter
 spaces,
 like
 this
 this


like
 I
 was
 just
 at
 three
 different


meetings.
 I
 came
 home,
 had
 a
 15-minute


meeting
 before
 I
 could
 even
 come
 back


upstairs
 to
 see
 them.
 And
 so
 I
 was
 like,


"You
 guys
 got
 to
 get
 your
 asses
 to
 work,


bro.
 What
 the
 hell's
 going
 on?"
 And
 then


my
 sister
 was
 like,
 "You
 literally
 wake


up
 every
 morning,
 you
 go
 to
 your


computer
 and
 you
 talk
 to
 a
 screen
 for


four
 hours
 and
 you're
 telling
 me
 about


work."


And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Look,
 when
 you
 you


can't
 you
 can't
 put
 it
 like
 that
 because


that
 you're
 you're you're
 you're


delegitimizing
 what
 I
 do
 every
 day."
 She


legitimacy.
 It's
 like,
 you
 just
 you
 just


talked
 to
 a
 computer.
 Like,
 what
 are
 you


complaining
 about?


I
 was
 like,
 "You
 don't
 get
 it."
 I
 was


like, "I
 don't know
 what
 to
 tell
 you.
 I


don't
 see."
 And
 then
 I
 was
 like,


"Microsoft
 had
 this
 stupid
 reaction.


Market
 started
 dumping.
 Everyone
 was


freaking
 out."
 I
 was
 like, "Do
 you


understand
 the
 pressure
 of
 being
 able
 to


communicate
 why
 that's
 happening?"
 She


was
 like,
 "That's
 not
 even
 a
 real
 job."


I
 was
 like,
 "All
 right,
 whatever.


Whatever."
 But
 that's
 what
 she
 said


yesterday.
 All right.
 Word
 of
 the
 day.


Disintermediation.


Disintermediation.
 the
 process
 where


customers
 or
 capital
 bypass
 traditional


intermediaries
 like
 banks
 or
 brokers
 and


go
 directly
 to
 the
 source
 for
 financial


services.
 Crypto's
 original
 promise
 was


massive
 disintermediation,
 removing


banks
 entirely
 from
 the
 transaction


layer.


Okay,
 I've
 definitely
 heard
 of
 this
 word


before
 in
 a
 variety
 of
 ways.


Disintermediation,


uh,
 not
 like
 the
 craziest
 finance
 word,


but
 basically
 saying
 customers
 going


through
 a
 different
 intermediary
 to
 be


able
 to
 get
 something
 done.
 In
 this
 case


with
 crypto
 obviously,
 you
 know,
 if
 you


don't
 have
 to
 go
 through
 a
 bank,
 the


ironic
 thing
 is,
 you
 know,
 now
 the
 banks


are
 embracing
 cryptos.
 You
 kind
 of
 do


have
 to
 go
 through
 a
 bank
 or
 a
 financial


institution
 to
 access
 like
 a
 crypto
 ETF.


But
 the
 goal
 of
 crypto
 is
 to


disintermediate
 from
 the
 traditional


finance
 institution.


So
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 That
 is
 what
 we


got


on
 uh
 on
 the
 day.
 My
 wife
 doesn't
 get
 it


either
 of
 it.
 Dude,
 I
 always
 give
 her
 a


hard
 time
 because
 it's
 just
 fun
 to
 like


mess
 with
 her
 and
 say
 this
 stuff,
 but


like
 she
 always
 comes
 back.
 It's
 like,


"You
 don't
 even
 work."
 I'm
 like, "No,
 I


do
 work.
 It's
 a
 different
 type
 of
 work."


But
 it's
 like
 fun
 because
 like
 me,
 you


know,
 we
 roast
 each
 other
 back
 and


forth.
 She's
 like, "You
 just
 sit
 on
 your


computer
 all
 day."
 I
 was
 like, "Yeah,


but
 there's
 like
 there's
 a
 nuance
 to


what
 it
 took
 to
 even
 get
 to
 this
 point


to
 be
 able
 to
 talk
 and
 the
 pressure
 of


of
 this
 moment
 and
 being
 there
 every


single
 day
 and
 like
 you
 know
 obviously


have
 people
 watching
 dealing
 with
 other


people's
 opinions.
 Like
 it's
 a
 totally


different
 type
 of
 world
 type
 of
 job.


But
 she's
 right.
 Like
 at
 the
 end
 of the


day,
 I'm
 not
 getting
 in
 a
 car
 and


driving.
 I
 did
 that
 for
 two
 and
 a
 half


years
 before
 I
 did
 this.
 I
 I
 know
 what


it
 feels
 like
 to
 drive
 a
 100
 miles
 every


day
 back
 and
 forth.
 But
 it's
 just
 a


different
 world.
 But
 she
 was
 dead
 ass


just
 sitting
 on
 the
 couch
 like
 relaxing,


acting
 like
 we
 were
 on
 vacation.
 I
 was


like,
 "Bro,
 vacation's
 over.
 We
 did
 that


for
 four
 days.
 Did
 that
 for
 four
 days.


Got
 to
 get
 back
 to
 work.


It's
 time
 to
 work."
 Siege,
 thank
 you
 for


the
 super
 chat.
 Appreciate
 you,
 brother.


I
 admit
 you
 have
 made
 my
 life
 a
 lot


better.
 Thanks
 for
 everything.
 Thank
 you


all
 for
 being
 here.
 Uh
 Amit,
 you
 are
 in


my
 top
 three.
 If
 you
 have
 these


screenshots,
 please
 send
 them
 to
 me
 or


tag
 me
 in
 them.
 I've
 been
 responding
 to


as
 many
 as
 I
 can.
 And
 again,
 I
 deeply


deeply
 deeply
 deeply
 deeply
 deeply
 do


not
 take
 for
 granted
 and
 appreciate
 uh


being
 part
 of
 people's
 content
 rotation


because
 you
 could
 choose
 to
 watch


anything,
 choose
 to
 listen
 to
 anything.


And
 uh
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 guys
 are
 here


every
 day
 for
 me
 and
 this
 entire


community
 means
 the
 world.
 So,
 thank
 you


everybody.
 Appreciate
 it.
 Uh
 I
 think
 you


guys
 will
 like
 the
 event
 that's


happening
 later
 today.
 I'll
 post
 about


it
 on
 X.
 We'll
 talk
 about
 it
 tomorrow


and
 I'll
 see
 everybody
 on
 the
 market


open
 tomorrow.
 Thank
 you
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 I'll
 see
 you
 guys


tomorrow.
 Bye
 everyone.
