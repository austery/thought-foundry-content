Love
 now
 and
 fall
 in
 love.
 I
 love


>> love
 was
 stronger
 than
 anything.


>> For
 the
 love
 of
 love
 and
 I
 love
 you
 more


than
 anything.


>> There's
 still
 love.


>> From
 the
 New
 York
 Times.
 I'm
 Anna


Martin.
 This
 is
 Modern
 Love.
 Today
 I'm


talking
 to
 Janette
 McCertie.


Janette
 pretty
 much
 grew
 up
 in
 front
 of


an
 audience.
 She
 was
 a
 Nickelodeon
 star.


You
 probably
 know
 her
 from
 the
 show
 I


Carly.
 But
 behind
 the
 scenes,
 she
 was


struggling.
 And
 she
 wrote
 about
 all
 of


it
 in
 her
 2022
 bestselling
 memoir,
 I'm


Glad
 My
 Died.


Now,
 she
 has
 a
 new
 book
 out.
 It's
 a


novel,
 and
 it's
 called
 Half
 His
 Age.
 And


it's
 a
 story
 about
 a
 relationship


between
 a
 17-year-old
 girl
 named
 Waldo


and
 her
 40-year-old
 teacher,
 Mr.
 Corgi.


What
 hit
 me
 about
 Half
 Age
 is
 just
 how


complicated
 this
 dynamic
 is
 between


Waldo
 and
 Mr.
 Corgi.
 Janette
 does
 not


sugarcoat
 their
 relationship,
 but
 she


also
 doesn't
 pass
 judgment.
 Janette
 told


me
 when
 she
 was
 18,
 she
 had
 her
 own
 age


gap
 relationship,
 and
 it
 took
 writing


this
 book
 for
 her
 to
 fully
 come
 to
 terms


with
 what
 happened
 and
 what
 she
 learned


from
 it.
 [music]


A
 heads
 up
 before
 we
 get
 into
 it,
 this


episode
 does
 get
 explicit.
 So,
 if
 you're


listening
 with
 kids
 around,
 save
 this


one
 for
 later.
 [music]


Janette
 Mccertie,
 welcome
 to
 Modern


Love.


>> Hi,
 Anna.


>> Janette,
 your
 first
 book
 was
 a
 memoir


that
 spent
 over
 80
 weeks
 on
 the
 New
 York


Times
 bestseller
 list.
 It's
 called
 I'm


Glad
 My
 Died.
 And
 now
 you've
 written
 a


new
 book
 called
 Half
 His
 Age.
 It's
 a


novel.
 It's
 fiction,
 but
 there
 are


elements
 of
 your
 own
 life
 that
 you


brought
 into
 the
 story,
 which
 we'll
 get


into.
 First
 though,
 why
 don't
 you
 tell


me
 about
 this
 book?
 What
 is
 Half
 his
 age


about?


Yeah.
 Half
 his
 age.
 Whoa.
 I
 got
 so


serious
 now.
 [laughter]


>> I
 like
 that.
 We
 can
 We
 can
 span
 all


these
 different
 tones.
 Please.


>> I
 was
 like, "This
 is
 the
 New
 York


Times."
 [laughter]
 Yeah.


>> Why
 is
 it
 sultry,
 too?
 Kind
 of.


>> I
 like
 that
 vibe.
 Please.
 That
 That


feels
 like
 it
 actually
 kind
 of
 fits
 with


what
 is
 Half
 as
 Age
 is
 about,
 right?
 A


bit
 of
 a
 sultry
 vibe.


>> All
 right.
 Give
 it
 to
 me.


>> Um,
 so
 Half
 Age
 is
 an
 exploration
 of


female
 rage
 and
 power
 and
 desire
 as
 told


through
 the
 lens
 of
 a
 very
 lonely
 and


ravenous
 17-year-old
 girl.
 M
 ravenous.


That
 is
 a
 specific
 word.
 Tell
 me
 what


you
 mean
 by
 that.


>> She
 wants
 desperately
 so
 many
 things.
 So


many
 things.
 She
 wants
 clothing
 that


will
 make
 her
 feel
 like
 someone
 other


than
 she
 is.
 She
 wants
 beauty
 items
 that


she
 thinks
 will
 make
 her
 feel
 like


something
 other
 than
 she
 is.
 She
 wants
 a


person
 who
 she
 thinks
 might
 make
 her


feel
 like
 something
 other
 than
 she
 is.


She's
 really
 desperately
 um
 seeking


identity
 and
 solace
 and
 comfort
 in
 many


different
 areas
 of
 life.
 She
 wants


there's
 this
 deep
 well
 of
 wanting.
 Yeah.


And
 let's
 even
 sort
 of
 set
 the
 scene


even
 more.
 She's
 she
 Waldo,
 the
 main


character,
 is
 17.
 She
 lives
 in
 Alaska.


What's
 her
 family
 situation
 like?


>> So
 Waldo
 was
 born
 uh
 to
 a
 teen
 mother.


Her
 mother
 had
 her
 when
 she
 was
 16
 years


old
 and
 she
 spent
 her
 childhood
 in


various
 trailer
 parks.
 Um
 she
 has
 you


know
 not
 great
 self-esteem
 as
 a
 result


of
 her
 circumstances
 and
 you
 know


various
 messaging
 that
 she's
 gotten
 from


various
 people


>> uh
 her
 mother
 society
 and
 now
 you
 know


when
 we
 meet
 her
 in
 the
 book
 she's
 just


going
 into
 her
 senior
 year
 of
 high


school


>> and
 it's
 in
 school
 that
 we
 meet
 the


other
 main
 character
 of
 this
 book
 Mr.


Corgi.
 Tell
 me
 about
 Mr.
 Corgi.


>> Mr.
 Corgi
 I
 I


>> pause.
 Where
 do
 we
 begin?
 No,
 you
 know,


>> there's
 two
 ways
 that
 I
 could
 answer


this.
 And
 one
 is
 this
 sort
 of,


>> you
 know,
 skewering
 him
 and
 defending


Waldo
 and
 protecting
 Waldo,
 which
 is
 one


instinct
 that
 I
 have.
 And
 the
 other
 is


to
 more
 uh
 to
 empathize
 with
 him
 and
 to


find
 the
 humanity
 in
 him.
 And


>> as
 challenging
 as
 that
 was
 kind
 of


throughout
 the
 writing
 process,
 that


wound
 up
 being
 really
 really
 pivotal
 so


that
 he
 wasn't
 too
 mustache
 twirly
 or,


you
 know,
 on
 then
 villainous.
 So
 Mr.


Corgi,
 if
 I
 try
 to
 touch
 into
 my
 empathy


toward
 him,
 you
 know,
 he's
 a
 40-year-old


creative
 writing
 teacher
 who
 has
 so
 many


failed
 dreams.
 None
 of
 his
 dreams
 for


himself
 panned
 out.


>> He's
 living
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 regret
 and
 a


lot
 of
 disappointment.


Most
 of
 that
 unprocessed.
 He's
 just
 kind


of
 chugging
 along,
 going
 through
 the


dayto-day,
 fulfilling
 his
 duties
 and


obligations
 as
 a
 husband,
 as
 a
 father,


as
 a
 teacher,
 and


trying
 to
 feel
 okay
 with
 himself
 despite


really
 feeling
 shame
 about
 not
 living
 up


to
 his
 expectations
 for
 the
 life
 that
 he


wanted
 for
 himself.


>> I
 mean,
 people,
 you
 know,
 can't
 see


this,
 but
 I
 have
 the
 the
 pleasure
 of


you're
 you're
 closing
 your
 eyes.
 I
 mean,


it's
 clear
 to
 me
 that
 you're
 inhabiting


his
 mind.
 And
 what
 you
 said
 about


empathy,
 I
 think,
 is
 so
 striking
 and
 so


important
 because
 Waldo,
 17,
 Mr.
 Corgi,


you
 know,
 40some,
 they
 begin
 a
 a
 sexual


and
 and
 a
 romantic
 relationship,
 a


deeply
 intimate
 relationship
 that
 the


rest
 of
 the
 book
 explore
 sort
 of
 the


peaks
 and
 the
 valleys
 and
 the
 fallout


of,
 you
 know,
 in
 in
 both
 of
 their
 lives.


Tell
 me
 more
 about
 what
 you
 said.


There's
 these
 two
 ways
 you
 could
 look
 at


him
 as
 a
 you
 know
 what
 was
 the
 f
 it
 was


like
 to
 really
 judge
 and
 then
 the
 other


was
 this
 empathy
 that
 you
 embodied
 and


you
 said
 that
 was
 a
 struggle
 when
 you


were
 writing
 this
 book.
 Tell
 me
 a
 little


bit
 more
 about
 that.


>> Yeah,
 I
 went
 through
 so
 many
 drafts
 of


this
 novel
 and
 in
 the
 beginning
 drafts
 I


really
 wrote
 Corgi
 as
 too
 on
 the
 nose,


as
 too
 villainous.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 was


me
 as
 a
 as
 an
 author
 interfering


um
 because
 I
 wanted
 to
 protect
 Waldo


>> because
 I
 felt
 so
 much
 love
 and


compassion
 for
 her
 and
 not
 as
 much
 for


Corgi.


>> I
 had
 those
 judgments
 toward
 him
 that
 I


think
 are
 the
 very
 easy
 kind
 of,
 you


know,
 first
 draft
 judgments
 that
 you're


going
 to
 have
 of
 a
 person
 in
 this
 kind


of
 a
 situation.
 And
 then
 when
 I
 would


read
 those
 drafts
 back,
 I
 realized
 he


just
 did
 not
 read
 grounded.
 He
 did
 not


read
 believable.
 And
 ultimately,
 because


he
 was
 reading
 that
 way,
 that
 was
 a


disservice
 to
 Waldo
 as
 a
 narrator.
 It


made
 her
 less
 credible.
 It
 made
 her


unreliable
 because
 you're
 going,
 "Well,


why
 is
 why
 does
 she
 even
 like
 this


person?
 What
 does
 she
 like
 about
 him?"


And
 for
 her
 to
 to
 be
 discredited,
 if
 she


were
 discredited,
 I
 would
 lose
 the


novel.
 So,
 I
 had
 to
 go
 in
 and
 try
 to


really
 empathize
 with
 him,
 really
 find


that
 compassion
 for
 him,
 and
 really
 feel


into
 the
 reality
 of
 being
 someone
 in
 his


position
 and
 the
 reality
 of
 being
 Waldo.


This
 book
 is
 told
 through
 Waldo's


perspective,
 this
 17-year-old.
 We're


really
 in
 that
 17-year-old
 brain.
 I


think
 you
 did
 a
 remarkable
 job
 of


inhabiting
 uh
 that
 age.
 It
 was
 so


effective.
 It
 was
 actually
 quite


uncomfortable
 for
 me.
 like
 you
 really


hit
 that
 funny
 fizzy
 mix
 of
 like
 bravado


and
 insecurity.
 The
 way
 that
 you


describe
 how
 Waldo
 puts
 on
 her
 makeup


like
 it's
 protection,
 like
 it's
 armor,


but
 she's
 never
 satisfied.
 All
 the


online
 shopping
 to
 kind
 of
 try
 on
 new


identities,
 how
 she
 hates
 the
 people
 in


school,
 but
 also
 sort
 of
 wants
 to
 be


them.
 It's
 like
 we're
 really
 inhabiting


this
 kind
 of
 intense
 fluctuation
 of
 the


teenage
 brain.
 Why
 was
 it
 important
 for


you
 to
 tell
 this
 story
 through
 Waldo's


perspective
 instead
 of
 I
 don't
 know
 like


a
 like
 a
 third
 person
 narrator
 telling


this
 story?


>> I
 also
 want
 to
 circle
 back
 to
 your


discomfort.
 I
 have
 I'm
 so
 curious
 about


about
 anytime
 somebody
 brings
 up


discomfort.
 I'm
 interested.


>> Oh
 my
 god.
 Ask
 me
 a
 question.
 I
 love


that.
 [laughter]
 What?
 Yeah.
 I
 mean
 in


terms
 of
 like
 why
 was
 I
 uncomfortable?


>> Yes.
 Oh
 my
 gosh.
 Well,
 I
 think
 it's
 it's


what
 I'm
 point
 it's.
 Like
 I
 remember


being
 this
 age
 and
 kind
 of


simultaneously


thinking
 I
 was
 the
 [ __ ]
 and
 thinking
 I


was
 [ __ ]
 Do
 you
 know
 what
 I
 mean?
 Like


it
 was
 just
 this
 this
 real
 roller


coaster
 moment
 to
 moment.
 Not
 even
 dayto


day.
 Just
 like
 truly
 many
 moments
 in
 the


day
 where
 I
 was
 like,


>> you
 know,
 I
 know
 stuff.
 I'm
 mature.
 Oh


my
 gosh,
 I'm
 you
 know,
 I
 don't
 know


anything.
 Like
 this
 just
 this
 constant


vacasillation
 of
 my
 identity.
 I
 feel


like
 I
 didn't
 have
 a
 core
 or
 a
 center.


And
 you
 know,
 speak
 about
 the
 wanting


that
 you
 said
 with
 Waldo.
 My
 gosh,
 I


wanted
 so
 much.
 So,
 I
 just
 I
 feel
 like


you
 put
 me
 in
 that
 unstable
 is
 the
 word


that
 comes
 to
 mind,
 but
 I
 don't
 mean


that
 in
 a
 judgmental
 way
 either.
 I
 just


mean
 like
 this
 kind
 of
 Yeah.
 electric


feelings
 of
 of
 insecurity
 and
 bravado.


That
 That's
 what
 it
 brought
 me
 back
 to.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 interesting.
 I
 also
 I
 feel
 like


unstable
 is
 the
 perfect
 word.
 I
 feel


like
 nobody's
 stable
 at
 17.
 There's
 so


much
 inherent
 instability
 and


uncertainty.
 You
 don't
 know
 where


anything
 is
 going
 to
 land.
 Uh
 it
 is
 so


uncomfortable
 to
 be
 17.


>> It
 is.
 Well,
 how
 did
 you
 get
 Let
 me
 just


ask
 like
 how
 did
 you
 as
 a


>> Sorry,
 rude
 to
 someone
 their
 age,
 but


from
 my
 research,
 you're
 33.
 Is
 that


correct?
 [laughter]


>> I'm
 31.
 Okay.
 So,
 we're
 all
 friends


here.
 Um
 the
 What
 was
 it
 like
 to
 put


yourself
 back
 in
 that
 17-year-old


perspect?
 How
 did
 you
 do
 it?


Well,
 maybe
 this
 is
 the
 way
 I
 relate
 to


a
 17-year-old
 most
 is
 that
 I
 always
 say


if
 emotions
 are
 on
 a
 scale
 of
 a
 1
 to
 a


10,
 I
 don't
 really
 feel
 anything
 beneath


an
 eight.


>> Like,
 wait,
 now
 we're
 not
 going


17-year-old
 you.


>> No,
 now
 now
 I'm
 a
 feeler.


>> Mhm.
 [laughter]


>> I'm
 such
 a
 feeler.
 I'm
 so
 um
 you
 know,


sensitive
 and
 fought
 that
 for
 a
 long


time.
 Now
 I'm
 you
 know,
 I'm
 okay
 with
 it


and
 and
 it's
 not
 that
 it's
 not
 ever


challenging.
 It
 certainly
 can
 be,
 but


I've
 always
 been
 this
 way.
 And
 so,
 I


think
 that's
 kind
 of
 an
 element
 of
 being


17.
 But
 the
 the
 real
 extremes
 I


definitely
 don't
 relate
 to
 anymore.


Thank
 God.
 Oh
 my
 lord.


>> Um,
 and
 the
 feeling
 the
 the
 kind
 of
 what


you're
 describing
 of
 the
 whiplash
 of


narratives
 dayto
 day.
 I'm
 the
 worst.
 I


I'm
 the
 best.
 You
 know,
 yeah.
 It's
 it's


um


>> quite
 disorienting,
 quite
 chaotic,


>> and


You
 know,
 it's


I
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 to
 describe
 it


other
 than
 it
 was
 just
 I
 was
 actually


okay.
 I
 was
 actually
 writing
 another


novel.


>> Oh
 my
 gosh.


>> But
 it
 [snorts]
 was
 something
 I
 feel


like
 this
 thing
 happens
 with
 ideas.
 Um


where
 it's
 like
 working
 on
 a
 project
 is


like
 being
 in
 a
 relationship.


>> And
 in
 the
 beginning,
 it's
 the
 honeymoon


phase
 and
 it's
 amazing
 and
 it's
 sexy
 and


it's
 hot
 and
 it's
 the
 greatest
 thing.


And
 then
 it
 becomes
 work.


>> Totally.
 And
 when
 it
 becomes
 work,


>> all
 your
 other
 little
 ideas
 start


looking
 real
 hot
 and
 you're
 going,


"Well,
 what
 if
 I
 dated
 them?
 Could
 I


just
 take
 them
 out
 on
 one
 date
 real


quick?"
 [laughter]


So,
 I
 was
 pretty
 deep
 in
 this
 other


novel
 and
 then
 half
 his
 age
 just
 started


pushing
 itself
 up
 on
 me.
 Yeah.


>> And
 what
 I
 mean
 by
 that
 is
 that
 Waldo's


voice
 specifically
 started
 really


pushing
 itself
 up
 on
 me
 and
 lines
 that


she
 would
 say
 and
 just
 sort
 of
 this


overwhelming
 almost
 flush
 of
 anger
 kind


of
 would
 surge
 through
 my
 body
 which
 is


I
 think
 you
 know
 much
 of
 Waldo
 is
 really


she's
 suppressing
 her
 anger
 and
 I
 think


that's
 really
 a a
 a
 key
 element
 of
 her


arc.
 Yeah,
 you
 do
 get
 that
 sense


throughout
 the
 book
 that
 Waldo
 is
 very


angry
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 quite


powerful
 emotion,
 you
 know,
 to
 to


experience
 from
 from
 Waldo's
 point
 of


view.
 We
 get
 this
 sense
 of
 anger,
 anger


towards
 her
 situation,
 anger
 towards
 Mr.


Corgi.
 You
 know,
 another
 thing
 too
 about


this
 account
 that
 I
 think
 is
 important


is
 that
 in
 this
 physical
 relationship


with
 Mr.
 Corgi,
 it's
 Waldo
 who
 makes
 the


first
 move.
 Can
 you
 talk
 to
 me
 about


that
 choice?
 Like,
 was
 that
 important
 to


you?
 And
 if
 so,
 why?
 [snorts]
 It
 was
 so


important
 to
 me
 that
 Waldo
 be
 very


aggressive,
 very
 forward,
 very
 adamant,


very
 bold,
 because
 ultimately
 she
 is


still
 17.


>> This
 in
 whatever
 ways
 she
 pushes,


asserts,
 inserts
 herself
 onto
 this


person,
 into
 this
 dynamic,
 she's
 17.
 And


I
 and
 I
 really
 tried
 not
 to
 be,
 you


know,
 moralistic
 or
 or
 finger
 waggy
 in


the
 writing
 of
 the
 book.
 And
 here
 I
 am


about
 to
 get
 moralistic.
 [laughter]


Um,
 I
 managed
 to
 go
 300
 pages
 and
 now
 it


all
 comes
 out,
 my
 friend.
 [laughter]
 Now


it
 all
 comes
 out.


>> But
 you
 know,
 it
 is
 it's
 like
 no
 matter


what
 this
 girl
 does,
 no
 matter
 how
 she


she
 could
 throw
 herself
 at
 his
 feet,


>> he's
 still
 40
 and
 he's
 still
 our


teacher.


>> If
 Mr.
 Corgi
 had
 made
 the
 first
 move.


What
 would
 be
 different
 about
 that


story?


>> I
 think
 it
 would
 be
 an
 easier
 story.
 Um,


I
 think
 it
 would
 be
 one
 where
 you
 can


label
 judgment
 a
 lot
 quicker


>> and
 you
 can
 write
 off
 both
 corgi
 and


Waldo
 in
 a
 sense
 and
 you
 can
 kind
 of


instantly
 put
 them
 into
 these
 boxes
 and


go,
 "Okay,
 I
 know
 what
 this
 story
 is.
 I


know
 I
 know
 what
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be."


You
 know,
 you
 really
 I
 think
 you
 could


close
 the
 book
 at
 that
 point
 to
 be


honest.
 You
 wouldn't
 need
 to
 read
 it.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It
 would
 be
 very
 clear


morally,
 but
 instead


you
 chose
 to
 write
 this
 book
 that
 I


we've
 said
 the
 word
 uncomfortable
 that


exists
 like
 much
 more
 in
 sort
 of
 a
 gray


area
 because
 Waldo
 wants
 like
 Waldo


wants
 him
 and
 and
 even
 in
 these
 sex


scenes,
 I
 mean,
 there's
 like
 a
 real
 kind


of
 mutuality
 there,
 right?
 It's
 not
 just


one
 person
 pursuing
 the
 other.
 They're


both
 hungry
 for
 each
 other.
 There's
 this


quote
 from
 Half
 his
 age
 where
 Waldo


says,
 "Sex
 is
 the
 one
 place
 where
 my


needs
 aren't
 too
 big
 and
 all
 of
 my


yearning
 is
 acceptable.
 The
 one
 place


where
 I
 can
 show
 how
 deep
 the
 well
 is


within
 me.
 The
 one
 place
 I
 can
 beg
 and


whine
 and
 scream
 to
 have
 it
 filled."
 So


it's
 like
 sexes
 is
 is
 this


representation
 of
 her


wanting
 of
 this
 kind
 of
 unquenchable


need
 as
 we've
 talked
 about.


>> Definitely.
 I
 think
 that's
 such
 a
 common


experience
 for
 young
 women.
 It
 was


certainly
 my
 experience.
 It
 was


certainly
 the
 experience
 of
 literally


every
 one
 of
 my
 female
 friends.


>> Bring
 it
 up.
 It's
 very
 and
 it's
 like,


you
 know,
 at
 that
 age,
 we
 don't


necessarily
 know
 how
 to


>> maybe
 even
 acknowledge
 our
 needs,
 let


alone
 articulate
 them
 to
 somebody
 else.


>> Emotional
 needs,
 not


>> emotional
 needs.
 Exactly.
 Exactly.
 And


so
 I
 think
 sex
 kind
 of
 acts
 as
 this


placeholder
 or
 this
 thing
 that
 we
 think


can
 house
 all
 of
 our
 needs
 that
 we


think,
 okay,
 well,
 you
 know,
 I
 want
 him


to
 treat
 me
 better,
 to
 make
 more
 time


for
 me,
 to
 um,
 you
 know,
 acknowledge
 my


emotions.
 Uh,
 instead,
 well,
 can
 he
 just


[ __ ]
 me
 because
 that's
 all
 I
 think
 I
 can


get?
 Maybe
 that's
 all
 I
 think
 I'm
 worth.


Maybe
 maybe
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 how
 to


vocalize
 those
 other
 needs
 yet.


In
 other
 interviews,
 you
 shared
 that
 you


had
 an
 experience
 with
 an
 age
 gap


relationship
 that
 started
 when
 you
 were


around
 18.
 Was
 writing
 Half
 his
 age


a
 way
 to
 process
 that
 experience
 for


you?
 In
 some
 ways,
 I
 think
 so.
 You
 know,


I
 definitely
 think
 that


seed
 of
 [snorts]
 that
 overlap
 was
 the


jumping
 off
 point
 for
 the
 novel.
 And


then
 of
 course,
 you
 know,
 Waldo's
 her


own
 character
 and
 and
 and
 half
 his
 age


is
 its
 own
 story
 and
 and


>> I
 know
 so
 many
 people
 will
 project
 me


onto
 this.
 I'm
 aware.
 I'm
 fine
 with


that.
 Although
 I
 do
 think
 it
 is
 a


misread
 because,
 you
 know,
 Waldo
 truly


truly
 is
 her
 own
 character
 and
 deserves


to
 be
 seen
 for
 that.


>> But


I
 do
 find
 writing
 is
 a
 way
 for
 me
 to


process
 things
 that
 I
 maybe
 hadn't


processed
 fully
 from
 my
 past.
 I
 do
 think


writing
 is
 a
 way
 for
 me
 to
 find
 closure


in
 areas
 where
 I
 didn't
 have
 closure.


>> Well,
 you
 mentioned
 that
 it
 was
 anger


was
 the
 kind
 of
 anchoring
 emotion
 that


pulled,
 you
 know,
 you
 towards
 this
 this


book
 into
 this
 story.
 So,
 it
 seems
 like


there
 must
 have
 maybe
 even,
 you
 know,


subconsciously
 been
 anger
 around
 this


experience
 that
 you
 perhaps
 needed
 to


work
 through.
 Does
 that
 feel
 true?


>> Yes.
 Several
 drafts
 in,
 I
 literally
 did


not
 know
 why
 I
 was
 writing
 this
 book
 and


I
 didn't
 want
 to
 analyze.
 I
 didn't
 want


to
 figure
 it
 out.
 I
 just
 thought,
 "Okay,


this
 is
 coming
 through
 me.
 Great.
 Let's


just
 go
 with
 it."
 And
 then
 a
 few
 drafts


in,
 I
 looked
 back
 over
 it
 and,
 [snorts]


>> you
 know,
 I
 was
 looking
 over
 it
 with
 a


red
 pen
 and
 a
 highlighter
 and
 realizing,


"Oh
 my
 god,
 I
 have
 so
 much
 unprocessed


anger
 about
 situations
 from
 my
 past.
 I


think
 that
 is
 the
 emotional
 charge
 that


is
 making
 this
 book
 happen."


>> Huh.
 How
 did
 it
 feel
 to
 realize
 that?


jarring
 I
 guess
 because
 you
 know
 I've


I've
 done
 so
 much
 work
 in
 therapy.
 I've


done
 so
 much
 you
 know
 personal
 work
 on


myself
 and
 I
 really
 really
 value


personal
 growth
 and
 it's
 something
 that


I
 it's
 not
 like
 I'm
 thinking
 about
 this


relationship
 is
 so
 far
 in
 the
 past
 I'm


not
 thinking
 about
 it.
 I
 don't
 feel


burdened
 by
 it
 in
 any
 way.
 I'm
 not


thinking
 like
 you
 know
 I'm
 it's
 really


not
 something
 that
 I
 think
 about.
 And


[snorts]
 so
 the
 fact
 that
 there
 was


clearly
 so
 much
 left
 to
 process
 that


needed
 to
 come
 out
 about
 it
 was


shocking.


[music]


Stay
 with
 us.


[music]


>> [music]


[music]


>> However
 much
 again
 you
 feel
 comfortable


sharing.
 Can
 you
 tell
 me
 about
 that


relationship
 that
 happened
 when
 you
 were


around
 18?
 Yeah,
 I
 was
 18.
 He
 was
 in
 his


mid30s.


And
 I
 was
 a
 very
 I
 was
 so
 much
 more


naive
 than
 Waldo.
 Waldo
 is
 so
 much


bolder
 than
 I
 was.
 She's
 so
 much
 more


perceptive
 and
 um


>> and
 sexually
 experienced.
 That's
 a
 big


part
 of
 the


>> Exactly.
 and
 sexually
 experienced.
 Um
 I


was
 perceptive,
 but
 I
 would
 kind
 of


shove
 down
 my
 instincts
 and
 not
 address


them
 at
 all.
 Waldo's
 glaringly
 aware
 of


how
 she
 thinks
 and
 feels
 about


everything
 at
 all
 times.
 Um,
 I
 respect


her
 for
 it,
 but
 I
 was
 very
 suppressed.
 I


grew
 up
 Mormon.
 And
 though
 my
 family


hadn't
 really
 been
 to
 church,
 you
 know,


in
 a
 in
 a
 few
 years
 at
 that
 point,
 I


still
 really
 had
 that
 kind
 of
 Mormon


value
 system
 embedded
 in
 me.
 And
 so
 sex


was
 bad
 and
 not
 something
 I
 was
 going
 to


do
 until
 marriage.
 And
 even
 sexuality


was
 sort
 of
 perverse
 and
 uh
 viewed
 as


perverse.
 And
 and
 I
 I
 had
 literally
 no


experience
 with
 men
 at
 all.


>> Well,
 like
 not
 even
 a
 kiss.


>> Let's
 see.
 I
 had
 had
 one
 kiss.
 I'd
 had


one
 kiss
 in
 a
 Hampton
 Inn
 in
 Suites
 in


Nashville,
 Tennessee.


>> Shout
 out.
 [laughter]


>> It
 was
 hot.
 Okay.


>> So,
 you
 had
 a
 kiss,
 but
 nothing.


>> Had
 a
 kiss.
 Exactly.
 Nothing
 beyond


that.
 Had
 never
 been
 on
 a
 date.
 Like


nothing.
 And
 then
 this
 happened.
 this


relationship
 with
 this
 this
 person
 and


and
 initially
 he
 was
 he
 had
 a


girlfriend.
 He
 he
 lived
 with
 his


girlfriend.
 [snorts]


>> Whoa.


>> Yeah.
 And
 there
 were
 a
 few
 months
 where


he
 was
 with
 her
 and
 and


we
 were
 essentially
 together,
 you
 know,


and


Yeah.
 [snorts]
 C.
 Can
 I
 ask
 you
 like


[sighs and gasps]
 putting
 yourself
 back


18-year-old
 you,
 like
 what
 intrigued
 you


about
 him?
 How
 did
 you
 feel
 when
 you


were
 with
 him?


>> He
 seemed
 real
 to
 me.
 You
 know,
 growing


up
 in
 Hollywood,
 there
 is
 just
 a
 certain


way
 that
 world
 operates.
 And
 it's
 really


never
 been
 one
 that
 I
 feel
 like
 I've


understood
 the
 rules
 of.
 It
 feels
 like


there
 is
 a
 secret
 code
 to
 Hollywood
 that


everyone
 was
 told.
 Everyone
 was
 just


tapped
 on
 the
 head
 with
 the
 rules
 of


Hollywood.
 And
 I'm
 sitting
 here
 going,


"A
 little."
 [laughter]
 And
 I'm
 going,


"What
 is
 literally
 anybody
 saying
 at
 any


given
 time?
 Why
 can
 nobody
 own
 an


opinion?
 Like,
 can
 we
 please
 somebody,


for
 the
 love
 of
 God,
 own
 their
 opinions?


Anyway,
 I
 love
 Hollywood.
 It's
 great.


[laughter]


>> Say
 it.
 Sound
 like
 there'd
 be
 fun


parties.


>> It's
 um
 Yeah.
 And
 and
 and
 I
 then
 I
 you


know,
 I
 met
 this
 person
 who
 just
 seemed


real
 and
 seemed


>> and
 were
 they
 I've
 heard
 another
 You
 met


them
 at
 work,
 so
 they
 were
 still
 part
 of


the
 world,
 but
 yeah,
 they
 felt


>> different
 from
 the
 world.
 Yeah.
 They


didn't
 feel
 Hollywood
 to
 me.
 Um
 they


didn't
 seem
 like
 they
 spoke
 in
 that
 kind


of
 code.
 It's
 it's
 not
 a
 wink
 and
 a
 gun,


but
 Hollywood
 really
 does
 kind
 of
 feel


like
 a
 wink
 and
 a
 gun.
 Um,
 as
 people
 are


just
 talking
 at
 you
 all
 the
 time,
 but
 he


he
 just
 felt
 different
 and
 he
 seemed


vulnerable.
 He
 seemed
 honest
 about,
 you


know,
 himself
 and
 and
 and
 his
 life.
 I
 I


was
 attracted
 to
 him.


>> And
 you
 were
 physically
 attracted
 to


him.


>> Yes.
 Although,
 you
 know,
 I
 suppose
 there


is
 some
 overlap
 here
 cuz
 when
 when
 Maldo


first
 meets
 Mr.
 Corgi,
 she's
 really


shocked
 that
 she
 is
 attracted
 to
 someone


who
 is
 not
 conventionally
 attractive.


Yes.


>> Up
 to
 this
 point
 in
 her
 life,
 she's
 only


been
 attracted
 to
 people
 who
 are


attractive.
 Yes.
 She
 calls
 out
 that


she's
 like,
 you
 know,
 the
 what's
 it?
 I'm


going
 to
 butcher
 your
 beautiful
 words,


but
 like
 the
 pores
 on
 his
 face
 and
 the


punch
 and
 the
 these
 types
 of
 things.
 She


like
 acknowledges
 these
 at
 the
 same
 time


as
 being
 like,
 I
 want
 his
 wrinkly
 balls.


I
 mean,
 that's
 something
 that
 you


mention
 in
 the
 book,
 right?


>> Yes.
 she's
 drawn
 to
 him
 and
 doesn't


really
 doesn't
 [snorts]
 know
 why
 because


this
 has
 never
 happened
 before.
 And
 um


you
 know
 that
 there
 there
 was
 certainly


some
 overlap
 in
 my
 experience
 where
 this


is
 not
 somebody
 who
 I
 I
 found
 you
 know


particularly
 physically
 attractive
 and


yet
 I
 felt
 very
 attracted
 to
 him.


>> Was
 this
 the
 kind
 of
 first
 time
 you'd


felt
 that
 intense
 physical
 attraction?


>> 100%.
 100%.
 It
 was
 this
 hungry
 kind
 of
 I


have
 to
 be
 with
 this
 person
 attraction.


>> Yeah,
 I
 know
 it.
 I
 mean,
 I
 felt
 it
 and
 I


can
 also
 remember
 that
 first
 time.
 How


did
 we
 talked
 about
 what
 drew
 you
 to


him,
 but
 how
 did
 he
 make
 you
 feel
 when


you
 were
 with
 him?


>> Seen
 in
 a
 way
 that


others
 really
 couldn't.
 I
 think
 I
 think


most
 other
 people
 were
 sort
 of
 taking
 my


I
 mean,
 it
 was
 like
 a
 goody
 two
 shoes


Mormon.
 I
 like
 I
 spoke
 in
 a
 different


voice.
 It's
 like
 Mhm.
 Yes,
 sir.
 Like
 so


annoying,
 obnoxious.
 And
 I
 think
 other


people
 took
 those
 behaviors
 at
 face


value
 and
 believed
 that
 I
 was
 that.


>> And
 there
 was
 something
 in
 him
 that
 was


like,
 what's
 really
 going
 on?
 Like


what's
 underneath
 that?
 I
 know
 I
 know


you're
 smarter
 than
 you're
 pretending
 to


be.
 I
 know
 you're
 seeing
 more
 than


you're
 pretending
 to.


What's
 kicking
 around?
 And
 so
 in
 that


way,
 there
 was
 sort
 of
 an
 opportunity


for
 me
 to
 learn
 more
 about
 myself


than
 I
 had
 before
 through
 others.


That
 must
 have
 been
 really
 validating


for
 the
 for
 a
 realer
 version
 of
 you
 to


be
 seen
 by
 someone.


>> Yeah,
 it
 was.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Of
 course,
 I
 have
 complicated


feelings
 about
 that
 now.
 [laughter]


>> Of
 course,
 when
 we
 will
 get
 to
 those,


but
 in
 the
 I
 think
 it's
 interesting
 to


sort
 of
 exist
 because
 in
 the
 space
 of
 of


your
 18-year-old
 brain,
 right?
 I
 mean,


we
 talked
 about
 how
 important
 it
 is


again,
 you
 are
 not
 Waldo.
 Waldo
 is
 not


you.
 It's
 like
 important
 to
 make
 that


distinction.
 You
 know,
 we
 spend
 so
 much


time
 in
 Waldo's
 brain.
 It's


illuminating.
 And
 now
 you're
 letting
 us


into
 like
 what
 was
 actually
 your
 exper


being
 in
 your
 brain
 being
 like,
 I'm
 I'm


being
 seen.
 Other
 people
 don't
 see
 me
 in


this
 way.
 This
 person
 feels
 real.
 This


person
 feels
 different.
 For
 the
 first,


you
 said
 bit
 of
 time
 while
 you
 were


seeing
 each
 other.
 This
 man
 was
 in
 a


relationship.
 So,
 was
 it
 a
 It
 was
 more


of
 a
 secret.
 This
 was
 just
 between
 you


two.


>> Yes,
 it
 was
 a
 secret.
 And
 it
 was
 a
 thing


that
 it
 was
 a
 secret
 and
 it
 was
 a


massive
 stressor.
 And
 I
 think,
 you
 know,


back
 on
 that
 now
 and
 the


undeniable
 link
 between
 generational


trauma
 and
 my
 experience
 in
 my


upbringing
 and
 why
 I
 was
 attracted
 to


that
 kind
 of
 a
 situation
 in
 the
 first


place.
 Now,
 of
 course,
 it
 seems
 utterly


insane
 to
 be
 like,
 wait,
 this
 person
 has


a
 girlfriend
 that
 he
 lives
 with
 and
 like


it
 just
 red
 flags
 on
 red
 flags
 on
 red


flags
 on
 red
 flags.
 But
 at
 the
 time


there
 was
 something
 that
 my
 body
 was


familiar
 with


>> in
 the
 stress
 that
 this
 relationship


provided
 me
 and
 a
 strange
 comfort
 in


that
 stress.
 This
 may
 sound
 gross.
 This


may
 sound
 confusing,
 but
 I
 think
 anyone


who
 grew
 up
 in
 a
 dysfunctional
 family


knows
 exactly
 what
 I'm
 talking
 about.
 I


grew
 up
 with,
 you
 know,
 parents


screaming
 and
 and
 fighting
 and


constantly
 and
 it
 was
 really
 chaotic.


And
 so
 my
 body
 I
 think
 expected
 and


accepted
 that
 kind
 of
 chaos
 as
 normaly


as
 home.


I
 mean
 the
 intimate
 dynamic
 the
 sexual


dynamic
 between
 the
 two
 of
 you.
 You


mentioned
 that
 you
 were
 not
 experienced


before
 this
 relationship


>> at
 all.
 I
 literally
 did
 not
 know
 what


come
 was.
 I
 did
 not
 know
 what
 come
 was.


[laughter]


>> You
 did
 not
 know
 what
 come
 was.
 Yeah.
 I


mean
 it's
 there
 is
 a
 time
 where
 we
 don't


know
 what
 come
 is
 18
 but
 [laughter]


>> that's
 where
 I
 was
 at
 kids.


>> I'm
 trying
 to
 like
 think
 about
 like


interest.
 Okay.
 Um
 and
 and
 what
 was
 it


like
 to
 discover
 that's
 not
 a
 question


I've
 ever
 asked
 on
 the
 show
 before.
 What


was
 it
 like
 to
 discover
 what
 come
 was?


But
 that
 is
 the
 question.


>> It
 was
 nasty.


>> And
 and
 this
 is
 like
 a
 hm
 how
 do
 I
 ask


this?
 It's
 like
 cuz
 cuz
 earlier
 on
 in


the
 conversation
 you
 were
 talking
 about


how
 you
 know
 sex
 for
 you
 became
 a
 really


important
 part
 of
 relationships
 or
 like


a
 container
 for
 emotional
 needs


>> and
 how
 I
 felt
 value.
 Frankly,
 I
 didn't


really
 see
 or
 understand
 my
 value
 in


other
 areas
 at
 all.
 I
 yeah
 I
 I
 really


believed
 that
 my
 value
 came
 from
 sex.


>> And
 this
 what
 was
 it
 this
 because
 this


was
 your
 first
 sexual
 relationship,


right?
 So
 it's
 where
 these
 sort
 of


neural
 pathways
 were
 being
 connected
 if


it
 were
 like
 how
 did
 sex
 factor
 into


this
 relationship
 and
 how
 did
 it
 sort
 of


teach
 you
 this
 is
 determinant
 of
 my


worth?
 Well,
 I'll
 share
 the
 come
 story


with
 you
 first
 cuz
 that
 was
 okay
 sort
 of


the
 tip
 of
 the
 iceberg.
 Right.


>> Of
 course


>> where
 so
 he
 had
 you
 know
 he
 had
 had
 a


girlfriend.
 This
 was
 maybe
 it
 began
 in


you
 know
 August
 or
 so
 and
 then
 by


October
 November
 it
 was
 really
 it
 was


becoming
 too
 difficult
 for
 me
 and
 so
 I


was
 the
 one
 who
 was
 like
 I
 I
 don't
 think


I
 can
 do
 this
 anymore
 and
 then
 of
 course


the
 moment
 that
 you
 say
 that
 is
 the
 m


well
 I'm
 leaving
 her.
 I'm
 going
 to
 leave


her.


>> Right.


>> Um
 the
 I'm
 I
 swear
 I'm
 going
 to


tomorrow.
 He
 eventually
 did.
 Yeah.
 It


was
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 it
 tomorrow.
 I'm


going
 to
 next
 week
 I'm
 going
 to
 and
 it


just
 kept
 getting
 punted.
 And
 then
 there


was
 this
 big
 kind
 of
 grand
 plan
 where
 he


was
 going
 to
 go
 out
 of
 town
 to
 visit


family
 for
 Christmas


>> and
 he
 was
 going
 to
 break
 up
 with
 her


when
 he
 returned.
 So
 he's
 going
 to
 go


break
 up
 with
 his
 girlfriend
 and
 then


I'm
 supposed
 to
 pick
 him
 up,
 right?
 And


so
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 to
 my
 apartment,


but
 then
 my
 mom's
 sick.
 So
 then
 she


comes
 to
 my
 apartment
 with
 like
 my
 dad,


my
 grandma,
 my
 grandpa,
 my
 three


brother.
 So,
 it's
 just
 like
 this
 big


Mormon
 dorky
 family
 [laughter]


in
 my
 apartment
 and
 I'm
 like
 trying
 to


bring
 my
 30-some
 yearear-old
 boyfriend


home,
 right?
 So,
 then
 I'm
 like,
 "Okay."


>> Sort
 of
 like
 Yeah.
 Worst
 case
 scenarios


in
 all
 directions.


>> Worst
 case
 scenario.
 Exactly.
 So,
 then
 I


I'm
 like,
 "Okay,
 I
 can
 I
 can
 problem


solve
 here.
 I
 know
 what
 I'll
 do.
 I'll


get
 us
 a
 room
 at
 the
 Sherin
 Universal."


>> Not
 the
 Hampton
 Inn
 where
 you
 had
 your


first
 should
 have
 gone
 back.
 They've


treated
 me
 well.
 Those
 warm
 cookies


[snorts]
 are
 great.


So,
 I
 got
 a
 I
 got
 a
 a
 night
 stay
 at
 the


Sheran
 Universal.
 I
 picked
 him
 up.
 He


was
 drunk
 off
 his
 ass,
 which
 I
 had
 never


had
 a
 sip
 of
 alcohol
 at
 this
 point.
 O


>> or
 um
 yeah,
 maybe
 I
 had
 had
 one
 sip
 at


this
 point.
 I
 don't
 know
 the
 timeline,


but
 I
 certainly
 had
 never
 had
 like
 a


glass
 of
 alcohol
 at
 this
 point.


>> And


so,
 I
 didn't
 know
 that
 he
 was
 completely


drunk.
 Like,
 now
 I
 get,
 oh,
 he
 was
 way


way
 way
 drunk.
 I
 was
 I
 don't
 know if


he'd
 had
 one
 drink
 and
 this
 is
 just
 what


a
 person
 looked
 like.
 He's
 like


stumbling
 around.
 There's
 beer
 stains


all
 on
 his
 shirt.
 Just
 a
 mess.


And
 I'm
 like
 a
 little
 embarrassed


already
 in
 the
 lobby,
 right?
 Cuz
 he's


just
 stumbling
 around.
 He's
 like
 banging


up
 against
 the
 elevator
 door.
 We
 get
 up


to
 our
 room.
 He
 can't
 even
 I
 remember
 he


couldn't
 swipe
 the
 key
 card
 on.
 He


couldn't
 get
 it
 to
 work.
 So
 I
 take
 the


key
 card.
 We
 go
 inside
 and
 then
 he's


sobbing
 and
 wondering
 if
 he
 made
 the


right
 choice,
 thinking
 he
 made
 a


mistake.


>> He
 broke
 up.
 He
 just
 he
 just
 broke
 up.


>> Literally
 just
 left
 this
 breakup.
 So,


he's
 in
 the
 throws
 of
 that
 and
 and


really
 emotional
 and
 then
 asks
 me
 to


give
 him
 a
 [ __ ]
 because
 up
 to
 this


point
 I
 have
 said,
 "I
 don't
 do
 sex
 till


marriage.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 do
 that.
 I


don't
 I
 mean,
 I
 didn't
 even
 really
 know.


I
 wouldn't
 have
 known
 how
 to
 do
 it."
 Um,


>> and
 so
 it
 had
 just
 been
 sort
 of
 kissing


up
 to
 that
 point.
 And
 then
 he
 says,
 "You


know,
 I
 I
 need
 to
 know
 that
 you're


comfortable
 doing
 something.
 I'm
 okay


not
 having
 sex,
 but
 I
 need
 to
 know
 that


you
 you'll
 do
 something
 because
 I
 need
 I


need
 my
 I
 have
 to
 have
 my
 needs
 met."
 he


had
 said.


>> Wow,
 that
 is
 really
 interesting


language.


>> Isn't
 that
 interesting
 language?
 Um,
 and


so
 I
 felt
 a
 flood
 of
 anxiety,
 like
 full


body
 fire
 anxiety,
 and
 just
 thinking,


okay,
 I
 have
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 do


this
 thing
 that
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 to
 do.


So
 I
 was
 like
 asking
 him


>> or
 else
 I'll
 lose
 or
 else.
 I
 mean,


that's
 the
 state.


>> Exactly.
 Exactly.


>> So
 then,
 and
 at
 first
 I
 said
 no.
 I'd


said
 no,
 you
 know,
 a
 couple
 times
 and


then
 it
 was
 okay,
 I'm
 leaving,
 you
 know,


that
 kind
 of
 thing,
 which
 was
 very
 much


our
 our
 dynamic.
 um
 as
 a
 whole
 was
 just


so
 unhealthy.
 But
 um
 of
 course
 I'm


included
 [clears throat]
 in
 that.
 I'm


not
 just
 putting
 that
 on
 him.
 But
 then


he
 he
 starts
 telling
 me
 kind
 of
 how
 to


do
 it.
 And
 so
 I'm
 giving
 him
 the


[ __ ]
 And
 then
 you
 know
 he
 says
 I'm


going
 to
 come.
 I
 don't
 know what
 that


means.
 I
 figure
 like
 come
 where?
 What


are
 you
 talking
 like?
 Are
 you
 sitting


up?
 Like
 that
 you
 know
 I
 didn't
 know


what
 that
 meant.
 And
 then
 it
 came
 in
 my


mouth
 and
 um
 I
 said
 something
 came
 out.


something
 came
 out
 and
 I
 like
 ran
 to
 the


sink
 and
 I
 was
 I
 thought
 he
 peed
 in
 my


mouth
 like
 like
 first
 I
 was
 like
 oh
 my


god
 he
 peed
 in
 my
 mouth
 but
 then
 I'm


like
 this
 doesn't
 I
 mean
 I've
 never


tasted
 pee
 but
 it
 doesn't
 taste
 like


what
 I
 think
 pee
 would
 taste
 like.


[gasps]
 Um
 and
 it
 was
 just
 so
 much


confusion
 so
 much
 body
 discomfort.
 Um,


and
 so
 much
 comedy
 gold
 now.
 [laughter]


>> I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 I
 mean
 I'm
 making


these
 sort
 of
 like
 sad
 laughter
 because


like
 [sighs and gasps]


there
 are
 parts
 of
 this
 just
 as
 there


are
 parts
 of
 this
 book
 that
 are
 funny.


Like
 there
 is
 humor
 here.
 There
 is
 humor


and
 being
 like
 what
 the
 heck
 is
 this?


you
 know,
 but
 but
 then
 you
 sort
 of
 zoom


out
 and
 you
 understand
 you
 see
 the


context
 in
 which
 you
 know
 this
 is


happening
 and
 the
 power
 dynamics
 that


are
 operating
 here.
 And
 so
 it
 is
 it


doesn't
 it's
 like
 humor
 alongside
 of


this
 other
 thing.
 I
 mean
 after
 this


happened


um


>> do
 you
 remember
 how
 you
 felt
 where


you're
 like
 I
 did
 it
 like
 he's
 I've
 got


him
 like
 I'm
 keeping
 him.
 What
 what
 was


the
 what
 was
 your
 feeling
 if
 you
 can


remember?
 No,
 I
 think
 I
 felt
 very
 shaky


and
 uncertain
 and
 I
 don't
 I
 didn't
 think


I
 had
 done
 a
 good
 job.
 Like
 I,
 you
 know,


growing
 up
 as
 that
 people
 pleaser,
 I
 was


really
 always
 rating
 myself
 in
 the


performance
 of
 how
 much
 I
 was


accommodating
 somebody
 else's
 needs
 and


desires.
 So,
 it
 was,
 you
 know,
 how
 did
 I


do
 on
 that
 [ __ ]
 Oh,
 I
 don't
 think
 I


did
 well,
 you
 know,
 and
 so
 then
 it
 was


just
 stress
 of
 thinking
 I
 I
 hadn't


really
 done
 well.
 Um,
 and
 I
 got
 better,


don't
 worry.
 Um,


[laughter]


>> I
 was
 freaking
 out,
 you
 know.


>> No,
 you
 worry.
 Um,
 [laughter]
 but
 you


know,
 I
 I
 am
 I'm
 glad
 you
 you
 bring
 up


this
 humor
 thing,
 too,
 because
 I
 think,


you
 know,
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 an
 important


piece
 of
 of
 all
 of
 this.
 I
 think
 there's


so
 much
 humor
 and
 levity
 in
 dark
 subject


matter,
 and
 to
 pretend
 there
 isn't
 is


actually
 denying
 the
 truth
 of
 it,


>> and
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 way
 of
 of
 there's


a
 way
 where
 humor
 can
 make
 something


flippant
 or
 undermine
 the
 subject


matter.
 And
 I
 don't
 like
 that.
 I
 I
 don't


think
 that.
 I
 think
 that's
 kind
 of


deflective
 and
 a
 defense
 mechanism.
 And


I
 I
 generally
 don't
 enjoy
 reading
 those


things,
 watching
 those
 things.
 They
 just


don't
 resonate
 with
 me.
 But
 I
 do
 think


there
 is
 an
 element
 of
 of
 humor
 and


tragedy.
 It
 can
 be
 really
 honest
 and


really
 um
 valuable.
 I
 think
 otherwise


something
 can
 just
 be
 too
 kind
 of


melodramatic
 and


and
 insincere
 in
 that
 way.


>> Huh.


Is
 there
 another
 moment
 from
 this
 time


in
 your
 life,
 from
 this
 relationship


that
 has
 that
 kind
 of
 that
 you
 think


about
 with
 some
 amount
 of
 humor?
 Is


there
 another
 moment
 that
 comes
 to
 mind?


>> I
 mean,
 literally
 every
 element
 of
 my


life
 that
 was
 happening
 at
 that
 at
 that


point.
 Um
 Jeez.
 Yeah.
 I
 was
 18
 on
 a
 on
 a


Nickelodeon
 show
 in
 a
 relationship
 with


a
 30-year-old
 person
 while
 my
 mom
 was


dying.
 And
 this
 sort
 of
 juxtaposition,


the
 highs
 and
 lows
 of
 that
 world
 were


were
 oftentimes
 really
 funny.
 You
 know,


it
 was
 it
 was
 hard
 at
 the
 time,
 but


there
 was
 certainly
 humor
 in
 almost
 any


given
 room
 at
 any
 given
 time.
 And


maybe
 I
 wasn't
 able
 to
 see
 it
 then,
 but


I
 think
 nowadays,
 I
 think
 somewhere
 in


my,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 mid
 late
 20s,
 it


shifted
 mid20s
 where
 I
 could
 kind
 of
 see


the
 humor
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 in
 real


time.
 It
 didn't
 take,
 you
 know,
 10
 years


of
 perspective
 or
 whatever
 to
 find
 the


humor
 in
 something
 happening
 currently.


[music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


>> [music]


[music]


[music]


>> The
 sort
 of
 ending.
 Speaking
 of
 this


relationship
 that
 you
 were
 in,
 can
 you


describe
 how
 how
 you
 left
 it?
 How
 things


how
 things
 ended
 or
 stopped?


>> I
 left
 his
 ass.
 [laughter]


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.
 Hell
 yeah.
 Okay.
 I
 mean,
 as
 much


as
 you
 want
 to
 share
 about
 that,
 I
 would


be
 curious
 to
 hear.


>> I
 was
 still
 acting
 at
 the
 time


>> and
 I
 was
 going
 away
 on
 a
 shoot
 to


Canada,
 I
 want
 to
 say,
 um,
 Toronto.


Yeah.
 [laughter]


I
 was
 trying
 to
 remember
 if
 I
 was
 doing


a
 shoot
 in
 New
 York
 or
 if
 it
 was
 a


different
 thing
 in
 Toronto,
 but
 I
 think


it
 was
 the
 Toronto
 one.
 And
 I
 just
 had


this
 feeling
 of
 of
 [snorts]
 life
 is
 in


front
 of
 me.
 I
 had
 actually
 broken
 up


with
 him
 once
 before,
 you
 know,
 and


there
 had
 been
 multiple
 he
 had
 broken
 up


with
 me.
 I
 had
 broken
 up
 with
 it
 was


again
 that
 kind
 of
 a
 thing.
 But
 um
 but
 I


had
 broken
 up
 with
 him
 as
 my
 mom
 was


dying.


>> Jeez,
 Janette.


>> This
 was
 kind
 of
 before
 this
 Toronto


situation,
 but
 as
 my
 mom
 was
 dying


because
 I
 felt
 like
 my
 my
 thinking
 was


this.
 I
 will
 bond
 with
 him
 too
 much
 by


like
 leaning
 on
 him
 and
 expecting
 the


support
 from
 him
 and
 going
 through
 this


experience
 with
 him.
 That's
 going
 to


bond
 me
 too
 much
 that
 I
 don't
 know
 if


I'll
 get
 out
 later.
 I
 don't
 know if
 I'll


be
 able
 to.


>> You
 will
 bond
 with
 him
 during
 this
 time


when
 your
 mom
 was
 dying
 and
 you
 might


not
 be
 able
 to
 extricate
 yourself.
 So,


better
 to
 get
 out
 now.


>> I
 felt
 like
 I
 may
 be
 stuck.
 I
 may
 be


trapped.
 that
 and
 that's
 a
 I
 really


don't
 like
 to
 feel
 stuck
 or
 trapped
 in


anyway.
 I
 like
 to
 feel
 free.
 How
 long


were
 you
 two
 seeing
 each
 other
 all
 told


with
 the
 ups
 and
 downs?


>> It
 would
 have
 been
 like
 maybe
 a
 little


over
 2
 years
 with
 a
 couple
 like
 short


breakups
 in
 between


>> in
 the
 relationships
 in
 the
 years
 that


followed.
 I
 mean,
 you
 had
 other


relationships.
 Would
 you
 would
 you
 think


about
 this
 guy?
 Would
 like
 something


clue
 you?
 No.
 Not
 at
 all.
 Huh.
 You're


shaking
 your
 head.
 Yeah.
 Not
 at
 all.


>> No.
 I
 literally
 it
 was
 truly
 I
 think
 by


the
 time
 I
 move
 on
 from
 things
 I
 am


ready
 to
 move
 on.
 I
 have
 tried


everything.
 I
 have
 exhausted
 all


options.
 I
 am
 confident
 in
 my
 decision


and
 that
 goes
 for
 literally
 I
 mean
 I
 can


think
 of
 so
 many
 relational
 and


otherwise
 that
 once
 I
 move
 on
 I'm
 going


I'm
 not
 looking
 back.
 There's
 I've


wasted
 enough
 time
 on
 this
 already.
 I'm


good.


>> Huh.
 But
 then
 this
 anger
 resurfaced.
 Why


do
 you
 think
 it
 resurfaced
 now?
 Like


what
 was
 it?
 Or
 not
 now
 in
 the
 moment
 of


writing
 this
 book.
 Why?
 What
 brought
 it


back
 up?


>> I've
 thought
 about
 that.
 I've
 explored


that.
 I
 think
 what
 it
 is
 is
 that
 in
 our


30s,
 we
 as
 women,
 we
 finally
 have
 this


space
 to


reframe
 our
 relationship
 with
 our
 past


self
 in
 a
 way
 to
 meet
 her
 with
 more
 I'm


actually
 getting
 a
 little
 goosebumps
 as


I'm
 saying
 this
 must
 be
 true
 where
 it


feels
 like,
 oh,
 I
 can
 see
 myself
 with


more
 compassion
 than
 I
 had
 for
 myself


before
 and
 more
 understanding.
 And
 you


know,
 our
 20s
 are
 such
 a
 blur
 typically


and
 we're
 just
 it's
 ambition
 and
 we're


trying
 to
 find
 our
 way
 and
 it's
 a
 mess


and
 relationship
 is
 just
 it's
 it's
 chaos


and
 it's
 fun
 chaos
 and
 it's
 me
 messy


chaos
 and
 it's
 ugly
 chaos.
 But
 then
 by,


you
 know,
 by
 30
 we've
 kind
 of
 started
 to


maybe
 land
 somewhere,
 find
 our
 footing,


settle
 in.
 There's
 space
 to
 reflect
 in
 a


way
 that
 maybe
 we
 didn't
 in
 our
 20s.
 And


I
 think
 it
 really
 opens
 up
 our


relationship
 to
 our
 past
 self
 in
 a
 way


that
 we
 didn't
 have
 access
 for


previously.


Oh
 my
 gosh.
 From
 one
 30
 something
 woman


to
 I'm
 like,
 "Yes,
 it's
 it's
 so
 true."


But
 I
 think
 what
 you're
 saying
 is
 is


very
 spot-on,
 at least
 with
 my


experience.
 This
 is
 the
 first
 time
 in
 my


life,
 this
 age
 where
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 have


that
 space,
 to
 reflect,
 to
 process,
 to


look
 back
 at
 things,
 you
 know,
 and
 and


and
 it
 seems
 like
 when
 you
 looked
 back


at
 this
 relationship,
 anger
 was


something
 that
 resurfaced.
 I
 guess
 I


wonder
 like
 in
 writing
 this
 book,
 do
 you


look
 back
 on
 that
 relationship


differently?
 Like
 is
 that
 do do
 you
 see


it
 in
 a
 new
 way?
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 think


that's
 one
 of
 the
 many
 I
 think


superpowers
 of
 writing
 is
 it,
 you
 know,


it
 does
 lead
 to
 closure
 where
 there


wasn't
 closure.
 And
 I
 think
 I
 I
 felt
 I
 I


didn't
 even
 realize
 that
 I
 didn't
 have


closure
 about
 this
 thing,
 but
 I
 think
 I


felt
 that.
 And
 there's
 um
 I
 think


there's
 a
 softness
 that's
 accessible


through
 I
 think
 letting
 the
 rage
 out,


letting
 it
 letting
 it,
 you
 know,
 lead.


There's
 now
 kind
 of
 um
 a
 softness
 and


dare
 I
 say,
 you
 know,
 an
 appreciation


maybe.


>> Wow.
 For
 that
 experience.
 Yeah.


>> For
 that
 experience.
 It's
 of
 course
 very


complicated
 and


um
 [clears throat]
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of


regret
 and
 it's
 not
 clean
 in
 any
 way.


But
 I
 think
 you
 know
 I
 can
 either
 stay


mad
 at
 it
 and
 hold
 on
 to
 that
 or
 I
 can


say
 you
 know what
 I've
 moved
 on
 from
 it.


I've
 learned
 from
 it.
 It's
 informed
 who


I
 am
 today
 and
 the
 choices
 I've
 made
 and


how
 can
 I
 take
 value
 from
 it.
 And
 I


think
 circling
 back
 to
 power,
 that's
 a


way
 of
 of
 finding
 power
 because
 maybe
 I


I
 didn't
 really
 feel
 any
 at
 the
 time.


>> This
 anger
 we're
 speaking
 of.
 Who
 were


you
 angry
 at?
 Him,
 yourself,
 the
 world?


Like
 what
 what
 was
 that
 anger
 directed


towards?


>> Him
 and
 myself.
 And
 then
 I
 think
 my


circumstances,


assuming
 that


some
 version
 of
 those
 circumstances


maybe,
 you
 know,
 led
 me
 down
 that
 path


or
 contributed
 to
 me
 landing
 on
 that


path.
 Hm.


>> Meaning
 like,
 you
 know,
 for
 example,


growing
 up
 Mormon
 and
 having
 such
 such


strict
 guidelines
 and
 rules
 constantly


in
 regulations
 and,
 you
 know,
 being
 on


kids
 TV
 and
 just
 feeling
 like
 I
 was


supposed
 to
 be
 this
 one
 thing
 all
 the


time.
 It's
 like
 a
 pressure
 cooker.
 It's


like
 it's
 like
 a
 shaken
 soda
 can.
 It's


like
 it's
 going
 to
 burst
 at
 some
 point.


And
 what
 better
 way
 to
 burst?
 What


better
 way
 for
 a
 people
 pleaser,
 Mormon,


child
 actor,
 mommy's
 angel
 to
 burst
 than


going,
 "Guess
 what?
 My
 first


relationship
 is
 gonna
 be
 with
 a
 30-some


year old
 man.
 Take
 that
 everybody.
 Like


>> mic
 drop.


>> Huh.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 I
 mean,


>> I
 wasn't
 thinking
 that.
 I
 of
 course


wasn't
 like,
 "Oh,
 I'm
 going to
 do
 this


to
 get
 back
 at
 people."
 But,
 you
 know,


in
 in in
 hindsight,
 I
 I
 do
 see
 elements


of
 that
 for
 sure.


[clears throat]


>> What's
 on
 the
 other
 side
 of
 anger?
 Like,


once
 you
 expel
 it,
 what's
 there?
 What's


left?


>> Well,
 I
 I
 don't
 even
 want
 to
 expel
 it.


Like
 I
 love
 anger.
 I'm
 so
 grateful
 for


anger.
 I
 think
 it's
 led
 me
 to
 make
 every


strong
 good
 decision
 in
 my
 life
 that


I've
 made.
 Um
 anger
 is
 what
 got
 me
 to


get
 over
 an
 eating
 disorder.
 Anger
 is


what
 got
 me
 to
 get
 into
 the
 right


relationship,
 which
 is
 the
 one
 that
 I'm


in
 now
 that
 I've
 been
 in
 for
 9
 years.


You
 know,
 anger
 is
 what
 got
 me
 to
 quit


acting
 and
 say
 no
 more.
 Anger
 is
 what's


gotten
 me
 anything
 good
 in
 my
 life.
 Wow.


I
 mean,
 it
 it
 sounds
 counterintuitive.
 I


feel
 like
 I
 emotionally
 understand,
 but


but
 help
 me
 understand
 more.
 When
 you


say
 like
 anger
 got
 me
 into
 this


wonderful
 relationship,
 how
 did
 anger


get
 you
 there?
 What
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 that?


>> Because
 I
 was
 so
 sick
 of
 previous


relationships
 and
 how
 I
 behaved
 in


previous
 relationships,
 how
 the
 other


person
 behaved,
 what
 the
 dynamic
 was.


Um,
 and
 I
 just
 thought,
 you
 know,
 I've


got
 to
 put
 in
 the
 work.
 And
 I
 would
 get,


you
 know,
 self-help
 books
 and
 I
 would


look
 at
 YouTube
 videos
 of
 therapists
 and


dating
 advice
 and
 just
 I
 thought,
 I'm


going
 to
 figure
 this
 out.
 I'm
 too


[ __ ]
 mad.
 I'm
 going
 to
 figure
 out
 how


to
 do
 it
 right
 and
 how
 to
 do
 it
 better.


I'm
 going
 to
 heal
 my
 the
 parts
 that
 need


healing
 so
 that
 I
 don't
 re
 re
 um
 create


these
 patterns
 and
 it's
 it's
 hard
 work,


but
 anger
 is
 so
 mobilizing
 that
 it
 can


get
 you
 through
 I
 think
 any
 amount
 of
 of


work.


>> Like
 thank
 God
 for
 anger.
 I
 think,
 you


know,
 sadness
 can
 really
 for
 me
 keep
 me


stuck
 and
 just
 in
 the
 trenches
 and


anxiety
 can
 keep
 me
 kind
 of
 debilitated


and
 oh,
 I'm
 not
 able
 to
 make
 a
 decision


cuz
 I'm
 too
 anxious.
 But
 my
 god,
 anger


will
 get
 me
 off
 the
 [ __ ]
 chair
 and


making
 some
 decisions
 and
 moving
 forward


and
 doing
 the
 work.


>> This
 is
 sort
 of
 a
 classic
 question,
 but


I
 think
 it's
 merited
 here.
 I
 if
 you


could
 talk
 to
 18-year-old
 you,


18-year-old
 Janette,
 what
 would
 you
 say


to
 her?


>> Run.
 [laughter]


>> Run,
 baby.
 Run
 fast.
 Run
 far.


>> Um.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> I
 really
 would.
 I
 really
 would.
 You


know,
 I
 mentioned
 earlier
 kind
 of
 an


appreciation
 for
 the
 past
 and
 and
 I
 and


I
 do
 feel
 that.
 But
 I
 also
 think
 truly


if
 I
 could
 tell
 myself
 anything,
 I'd
 say


run.
 cuz
 sure
 you've
 got
 stories
 to
 tell


now,
 but
 you
 would
 have
 had
 other


stories
 to
 tell
 if
 you'd
 have
 just
 left


those
 situations,
 numerous
 situations.


>> I
 think
 that's
 the
 first
 time
 I've
 heard


that
 response,
 run.
 And
 it
 was


immediate.
 It
 was
 immediate.
 Often
 times


people
 like,
 and
 I
 have,
 you
 know,
 just


be
 gentle
 with
 yourself.
 You're
 like,


get


>> the
 hell
 out
 of
 dodge.
 [laughter]


>> Wow.
 Janette,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 this


conversation.


>> Thank
 you,
 Anna.
 It's
 been
 so
 rich.
 I


was
 going
 to
 say
 fun.
 Fun
 is


appropriate.
 rich
 is
 appropriate,
 but
 it


just
 feels
 um
 fulfilling.
 So,
 thank
 you.
