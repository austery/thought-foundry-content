From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Natalie


Kitrov.
 This
 is
 the
 Daily.
 [music]


These
 aren't
 people
 that
 work.
 These


aren't
 people
 that
 say,
 "Let's
 go.
 Come


on.
 [music]
 Let's
 make
 this
 place


great."
 These
 are
 people
 that
 do
 nothing


but
 complain.


>> During
 a
 cabinet
 meeting
 on
 Tuesday,


[music]


President
 Trump
 delivered
 perhaps
 the


most
 blatantly
 xenophobic
 public
 remarks


of
 his
 political
 career.
 and
 we're
 going


to
 go
 the
 wrong
 way
 if
 we
 keep
 taking


[music]
 in
 garbage
 into
 our
 country.


>> Attacking
 Somali
 Americans
 in
 Minnesota


and
 calling
 them
 garbage.


>> You
 know,
 they
 came
 from
 paradise
 and


they
 said
 this
 isn't
 paradise.
 [music]


But
 when
 they
 come
 from
 hell


and
 they
 complain
 and
 do
 nothing
 but




we
 don't
 want
 them
 in
 our
 country.
 Let


them
 go
 back
 to
 where
 they
 came
 from
 and


fix
 it.


Today,
 [music]
 my
 colleague
 Ernesto


Londano
 on
 the
 story
 of
 how
 Somali


became
 the
 [music]
 president's
 latest


target
 in
 his
 ongoing
 effort
 to
 reshape


America's
 relationship
 [music]


to
 its
 immigrant
 communities.


It's
 Thursday,
 [music]
 December
 4th.


Ernesto,
 the
 president's
 comments
 about


Somali
 immigrants
 this
 week
 were,
 I


think
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 us,
 truly
 shocking.


Even
 for
 a
 president
 who's
 known
 for


making
 extreme
 comments
 about


immigrants,
 he
 called
 an
 entire
 group
 of


people
 garbage
 in
 a
 nationally
 televised


cabinet
 meeting.
 You're
 in
 Minnesota
 as


a
 national
 correspondent.
 So
 tell
 us,


how
 were
 these
 comments
 received
 there?


>> I
 think
 people
 here
 have
 been
 shell


shocked
 by
 the
 comments.
 I
 think
 they're


not
 [snorts]
 surprised
 that
 the


president
 would
 say
 things
 that
 are


disparaging
 of
 the
 Somali
 community
 or


about
 his
 immigration
 philosophy,
 but
 I


I
 do
 think
 the
 tone
 and
 tenor
 of
 what


was
 said
 at
 the
 White
 House
 yesterday


struck
 people
 here
 as
 just
 beyond
 the


pale.
 And
 it's
 induced
 a
 prevailing


sense
 of
 terror
 among
 the
 80,000
 or
 so


people
 of
 Somali
 ancestry
 that
 live
 in


the
 state.
 The
 vast
 majority
 of
 whom
 are


American
 citizens
 or
 legal
 permanent


residents


>> and
 they're
 a
 big
 part
 of
 the
 fabric
 of


Minnesota.
 They're
 ascendant
 in


politics.
 There's
 many
 Somali
 Americans


who
 are
 in
 the
 state
 legislature
 and


hold
 other
 local
 office.
 They
 are


business
 owners.
 They
 work
 bluecollar


jobs.
 They
 work
 in
 healthcare
 and
 the


idea
 that
 overnight
 their
 president


refers
 to
 them
 as
 garbage
 and
 says
 that


he
 wishes
 they
 would
 just
 all
 go
 home


was
 truly
 jarring.


>> Tell
 me
 about
 the
 terror
 that
 you


described.
 What
 is
 prompting
 the
 fear
 in


the
 community
 specifically?
 This
 week
 we


learned
 that
 the
 Trump
 administration


has
 deployed
 roughly
 100
 immigration


agents
 to
 come
 in
 and
 apparently
 look


for
 Somalis
 who
 are
 subject
 to


deportation
 orders.
 As
 we
 understand


that
 this
 is
 a
 fairly
 small
 pool
 of


people.
 We're
 talking
 about
 maybe
 a
 few


hundred
 people
 who
 have
 pending
 asylum


cases
 or
 for
 whatever
 reason
 came
 here


legally
 but
 fell
 out
 of
 status
 because


they
 may
 have
 committed
 a
 crime.
 So


what's
 happened
 is
 there's
 a
 sense
 that


a
 crackdown
 on
 immigration
 is
 starting


to
 take
 root
 in
 Minnesota
 and
 that


businesses
 and
 homes
 may
 become
 the


targets
 of
 immigration
 raids.
 What
 this


has
 meant
 so
 far
 is
 that
 people
 are


thinking
 twice
 about
 whether
 they
 feel


safe
 going
 to
 work
 even
 if
 they
 have


legal
 status
 and
 just
 people
 kind
 of


mulling
 whether
 they
 even
 feel


comfortable
 going
 to
 the
 grocery
 store.


And
 the
 fear
 is
 not
 merely
 about
 running


into
 immigration
 agents.
 The
 fear
 also


has
 become
 that
 this
 prevailing
 toxic


rhetoric
 about
 Somali
 and
 Somali
 culture


has
 empowered
 people
 who
 are
 racist
 to


do
 and
 say
 things
 that
 amount
 to


harassment
 and
 hatred.
 Hm.


>> I
 spoke
 to
 a
 Somali
 American
 immigration


lawyer
 who
 said
 he's
 been
 flooded
 with


calls,
 including
 from
 American
 citizens


who
 report
 just
 being
 taunted
 and


harassed
 on
 the
 street.


>> You're
 saying
 people
 are
 seeing
 this
 as


potentially
 giving
 people
 permission
 to


act
 on
 their
 worst
 instincts.
 It's
 a


permission
 structure.


>> Correct.


>> Okay.
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 why
 this
 is


happening.
 why
 the
 federal
 government


has
 turned
 its
 attention
 to
 this


community
 of
 80,000
 people.
 In
 his
 diet


tribe,
 Trump
 hinted
 at
 the
 reason
 for


the
 hostility.
 He
 said
 that
 Somali
 had


stolen
 all
 of
 this
 money.
 This
 is
 a


story
 you've
 been
 covering,
 right?
 Walk


us
 through
 how
 Somali
 became
 the
 subject


of
 this
 vitriolic
 attack
 from
 the


president.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 the
 origin
 of


this
 saga
 dates
 back
 to
 2020.


And
 what
 happened
 was,
 you
 know,
 during


the
 early
 weeks
 of
 the
 pandemic,
 state


officials
 were
 really
 worried
 about


whether
 people
 were
 being
 fed,
 were


people
 going
 to
 be
 housed
 as
 many
 lost


their
 jobs.
 And
 as
 we
 all
 sort
 of


collectively
 descended
 into
 this
 fearful


moment
 induced
 by
 COVID
 19.
 And
 there


was
 one
 specific
 program
 that
 state


officials
 were
 managing
 to
 keep


vulnerable
 kids
 fed
 during
 the
 pandemic.


[snorts]
 What
 happened
 was
 that
 turned


into
 a
 magnet
 for
 fraudsters
 who
 began


registering
 as
 meal
 sites
 saying
 that


they
 were
 feeding
 tens
 of
 thousands
 of


children
 when
 in
 reality
 what
 they
 were


doing
 was
 submitting
 bogus
 invoices
 and


stealing
 a
 staggering
 amount
 of
 money.


>> Right.
 This
 is
 something
 we've
 known


about,
 right?
 This
 was
 part
 of
 the


widespread
 fraud
 that
 we
 saw
 where


pandemic
 programs
 were
 taken
 advantage


of.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 even
 in
 the
 context
 of


the
 stunning
 amount
 of
 money
 that
 people


stole
 during
 the
 pandemic,
 targeting
 a


wide
 range
 of
 programs,
 including


business
 loans
 and
 unemployment


benefits.
 What
 happened
 in
 Minnesota
 was


unique
 in
 just
 the
 scale
 and
 officials


have
 described
 it
 as
 the
 most
 brazen


case
 of
 its
 kind
 just
 by
 the
 sheer


number
 of
 people
 involved
 and
 the
 amount


of
 money
 that
 was
 stolen.


>> How
 far
 did
 it
 actually
 go?
 Like
 what


are
 we
 talking
 about
 here
 in
 terms
 of


scale,
 in
 terms
 of
 scope?


>> Well,
 78
 people
 have
 now
 been
 charged
 in


the
 scheme
 in
 federal
 court.
 The
 vast


majority
 of
 them
 are
 Somali
 Americans.


More
 than
 50
 have
 already
 been
 convicted


in
 these
 cases.
 And
 initially,
 I
 think


many
 local
 officials
 were
 outraged
 that


this
 happened,
 but
 they
 essentially
 said


this
 probably
 was
 a
 one-off
 abuse
 during


the
 pandemic
 when
 there
 was
 a
 real
 sense


of
 urgency
 about
 getting
 money
 to
 people


who
 needed
 it.


>> Mhm.


However,
 in
 recent
 years,
 as
 prosecutors


dug
 into
 court
 records
 and
 as
 they


started
 interviewing
 witnesses,


something
 really
 jarring
 came
 to
 their


attention.
 This
 was
 not,
 in
 fact,
 a


[music]
 one-off.
 What
 they
 found
 was


that
 networks
 of
 people
 had
 found


loopholes
 in
 other
 programs
 that
 weren't


COVID
 pandemic
 era
 programs,
 but
 just


run-of-the-mill
 safety
 net
 programs


designed
 to
 help
 people
 at
 risk
 of


homelessness,


>> kids
 with
 autism,
 and
 that
 they
 were


charging
 a
 staggering
 amount
 of
 money


for
 services
 that
 weren't
 rendered.
 And


collectively,
 according
 to
 federal


prosecutors,


up
 to
 $1
 billion
 has
 been
 stolen
 just
 in


these
 three
 schemes.


>> Remarkable.


>> And
 what
 state
 officials
 have
 said
 was


that
 fraud
 essentially
 became
 the


business
 model
 and
 that
 these
 people


were
 acting
 kind
 of
 above
 board.
 They


had
 office
 space
 that
 they
 leased
 all


around
 town.
 They
 had
 websites.
 They
 had


business
 cards.
 and
 they
 were
 sort
 of


stealing
 staggering
 amounts
 of
 money
 in


plain
 sight
 and
 state
 officials
 tasked


with
 overseeing
 and
 supervising
 these


programs
 were
 just
 paying
 the
 invoices


that
 came
 in.


>> Wow.


I
 spoke
 to
 a
 defense
 lawyer
 who
 has


represented
 people
 involved
 in
 some
 of


these
 schemes
 and
 he
 said
 that
 among
 the


people
 who
 were
 stealing
 money
 over
 the


years
 they
 kind
 of
 came
 to
 think
 that
 it


had
 become
 so
 easy
 to
 tap
 into
 these


funds
 and
 you
 know
 get
 rich
 fraudulently


that
 they
 kind
 of
 assumed
 state


officials
 were
 tolerating
 this
 if
 not


outright
 authorizing
 it.
 And
 the
 way
 he


described
 it
 was,
 you
 know,
 it
 was
 like


people
 were
 stealing
 from
 the
 cookie
 jar


one
 day
 and
 the
 next
 morning
 they
 had


refilled
 it.


>> You're
 saying
 this
 went
 far
 beyond
 just


pandemic
 fraud
 and
 that
 almost
 everyone


involved
 in
 these
 schemes
 was
 Somali


Americans.
 But
 if
 the
 figures
 were
 so


big,
 how
 did
 it
 go
 unnoticed?


That
 is
 a
 great
 question
 that
 state


officials
 are
 really
 struggling
 to


answer,
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 useful
 to
 go


back
 in
 time
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 kind
 of


remember
 the
 context
 in
 which
 this
 took


hold.
 So,
 there
 were
 red
 flags
 that


emerged
 in
 2020
 when
 money
 was
 gushing


into
 this
 program
 to
 feed
 children.
 And


when
 state
 officials
 felt
 overwhelmed
 by


the
 sheer
 number
 of
 business
 owners
 who


wanted
 in
 on
 the
 program,
 who
 wanted
 to


be
 serving
 meals
 and
 be
 reimbursed
 for


them,
 and
 when
 they
 started
 reviewing


the
 invoices
 that
 were
 coming
 to
 them,


they
 had
 questions.
 And
 those
 questions


were
 met
 with
 an
 extraordinary


accusation


>> which
 was
 what


>> the
 largest
 group
 that
 was
 organizing


meal
 providers
 in
 this
 program
 was


called
 feeding
 our
 future.
 It
 was
 a


nonprofit
 organization


and
 in
 response
 to
 questions
 from
 state


officials.
 They
 essentially
 said
 the


state
 was
 sloww
 walking
 these
 new


petition
 for
 people
 who
 wanted
 in
 on
 the


program
 because
 they
 were
 being
 racist


against
 East
 African
 immigrants.
 Hm.


>> And
 I
 think
 it's
 useful
 to
 remember
 what


was
 happening
 in
 the
 state
 at
 the
 time.


This
 fight
 is
 unfolding
 as
 Minnesota
 is


grappling
 with
 the
 aftermath
 of
 the


killing
 of
 George
 Floyd,
 which
 of
 course


set
 off
 a
 national
 reckoning
 over
 race.


So
 in
 the
 state
 at
 that
 time,
 nobody


wanted
 to
 be
 called
 a
 racist,
 even
 if
 it


was
 wholly
 unfounded.
 And
 I
 think
 the


consensus
 now
 among
 people
 who
 have


watched
 the
 sequence
 of
 events
 was
 that


that
 really
 had
 a
 paralyzing
 effect
 on


people
 in
 state
 government
 who
 knew


something
 funny
 was
 going
 on
 but
 didn't


really
 want
 to
 stick
 their
 necks
 out
 and


stop
 it.


>> Right.
 This
 was
 happening
 in
 a
 very


particular
 place
 at
 a
 very
 particular


time
 when
 tensions
 over
 race
 are


extremely
 high.


>> Correct.
 But
 I
 think
 there's
 another


layer
 to
 this
 and
 that
 is
 that
 Somali


Americans
 have
 become
 politically
 quite


powerful
 in
 the
 state
 and
 I
 think


Democratic
 lawmakers
 have
 seen
 them
 as
 a


really
 vital
 constituency
 and
 there
 were


instances
 in
 which
 the
 people
 who
 were


responsible
 for
 some
 of
 these
 fraud


schemes
 came
 to
 state
 lawmakers
 and


asked
 for
 help,
 asked
 for
 intervention


or
 became
 important
 donors.
 to
 their


campaigns.
 So,
 I
 think
 there
 is
 a
 sense


that
 beyond
 the
 threat
 of
 being
 called


racist,
 some
 Democratic
 elected


officials
 in
 the
 state
 were
 just
 really


worried
 that
 any
 action
 they
 took
 to


question
 or
 intervene
 in
 a
 way
 that


would
 maybe
 stop
 these
 schemes
 could


have
 alienated
 a
 really
 important


constituency.


>> Got
 it.
 So,
 there
 was
 a
 perceived


political
 risk
 there.
 Eventually
 though,


prosecutors
 do
 start
 to
 go
 after
 this,


right?
 So,
 as
 the
 details
 of
 this


yearslong
 billion
 dollar
 scandal
 start


to
 spill
 out
 into
 the
 open,
 do
 motans


start
 to
 reckon
 with
 how
 this
 threat
 of


accusing
 people
 of
 racism
 was
 used
 as
 a


tool
 to
 allow
 this
 fraud
 to
 go
 on?


>> Well,
 that
 certainly
 caused
 a
 huge


amount
 of
 outrage
 in
 the
 state,
 but
 I


don't
 think
 anything
 necessarily
 changed


in
 the
 immediate
 aftermath.
 It
 was


actually
 later,
 it
 was
 this
 year,
 this


summer,
 when
 there
 was
 a
 change
 of
 guard


at
 the
 local
 US
 attorney's
 office
 in


Minnesota.
 And
 what
 happened
 was
 the


prosecutor
 who
 had
 been
 leading
 these


fraud
 cases,
 Joe
 Thompson,
 became
 the


acting
 US
 attorney.
 And
 he
 took
 it
 upon


himself
 to
 really
 turn
 up
 the
 volume
 on


the
 nature
 and
 the
 scope
 of
 the
 problem.


He
 started
 giving
 press
 conferences
 and


interviews
 in
 which
 it
 started
 feeling


like
 he
 was
 doing
 more
 than
 just


indicting
 individuals
 who
 were


committing
 fraud.
 He
 started
 speaking
 in


a
 way
 that
 felt
 like
 he
 was
 indicting


the
 whole
 system
 that
 had
 allowed
 this


to
 metastasize.
 And
 his
 argument
 was
 we


can't
 indict
 our
 way
 out
 of
 this


problem.
 There's
 just
 too
 many
 people


who
 are
 stealing.
 There's
 too
 many


programs
 that
 are
 now
 vulnerable.
 And


unless
 and
 until
 people
 in
 the
 state


truly
 start
 wrestling
 with
 what
 has


taken
 root
 and
 start
 implementing


stronger
 safeguards,
 the
 state
 is
 going


to
 lose
 its
 ability
 to
 provide
 services


to
 people
 who
 actually
 need
 them.
 And
 in


my
 interview
 with
 him,
 he
 for
 the
 first


time
 addressed
 the
 racial
 dimension
 of


this
 and
 said
 that
 from
 his
 vantage


point,
 weaponizing
 allegations
 of
 racism


in
 Minnesota
 during
 the
 period
 when
 this


happened
 played
 a
 big
 role
 in
 inhibiting


a
 more
 forceful
 response
 from
 the
 kind


of
 people
 who
 could
 have
 stopped
 this
 on


the
 front
 end.
 So
 it
 is
 at
 this
 point
 a


place
 that's
 doing
 some
 soularching


about
 what
 happens
 when
 you
 know
 it's
 so


lacks
 in
 the
 enforcement
 of
 its
 own


rules
 and
 regulations
 around
 these


liberal
 policies
 that
 those
 policies


start
 to
 get
 taken
 advantage
 of
 and
 and


potentially
 end
 up
 turning
 people


against
 them.


>> Correct.


And
 in
 recent
 weeks
 we
 start
 seeing


lawmakers
 start
 asking
 some
 of
 the
 right


questions.
 we
 start
 seeing
 the
 governor


implement
 stronger
 safeguards
 to
 try
 to


prevent
 fraud
 and
 to
 detect
 fraud
 in


other
 programs.
 So,
 I
 think
 we're
 seeing


kind
 of
 the
 early
 phases
 of
 a


constructive
 reckoning
 that
 people
 here


were
 hoping
 would
 lead
 to
 less
 fraud.


However,
 once
 this
 issue
 crosses
 the


radar
 of
 the
 White
 House,
 once
 it's


something
 that
 captures
 President


Trump's
 imagination,


that
 reckoning
 starts
 to
 take
 a
 very


[music]


different
 shape.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Ernesto,


you
 just
 told
 us
 that
 things
 on
 the


ground
 in
 Minnesota
 have
 taken
 a
 very


different
 turn
 since
 Trump
 started
 to


focus
 on
 this.
 And
 I
 want
 to
 understand


that.
 But
 first,
 can
 we
 just
 get
 to
 the


question
 of
 why
 Trump
 decided
 to
 seize


on
 this
 right
 now?
 Because
 you've


described
 this
 scandal
 that's
 been


playing
 out
 in
 the
 background
 for
 a


while
 now,
 for
 years,
 with
 this
 steady


drum
 beat
 of
 revelations
 coming
 out
 over


time.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 there
 were
 a
 sequence
 of


events
 that
 turned
 this
 into
 a
 front


burner
 issue
 for
 the
 White
 House.
 The


first
 one
 was
 a
 report
 by
 Chris
 Rufo,


the
 conservative
 activist,
 which
 created


the
 inference
 that
 some
 of
 the
 money


that
 had
 been
 stolen
 in
 these
 schemes
 in


Minnesota
 had
 wound
 up
 in
 the
 hands
 of


terrorists
 in
 Africa,
 namely
 members
 of


the
 group
 al-Shabaab
 in
 Somalia.
 So,


this
 is
 a
 figure
 who
 has
 taken
 on


universities
 and
 has
 become
 very


influential
 in
 conservative
 circles.
 So


the
 fact
 that
 he
 drew
 attention
 to
 this


made
 it
 land
 in
 Washington
 DC


>> and
 Rufo
 here
 is
 specifically
 saying


that
 this
 money
 from
 the
 fraud
 that
 it


has
 a
 link
 to
 terrorism.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 to
 be
 clear,


prosecutors
 have
 drawn
 no
 such
 link.


None
 of
 these
 federal
 cases
 have


featured
 any
 link
 whatsoever
 to


terrorism.
 But
 nonetheless,
 the
 headline


on
 this
 piece
 was
 quote,
 "The
 largest


funer
 of
 al-Shabaab
 is
 the
 Minnesota


taxpayer."


>> Wow.
 Okay.
 So,
 that
 got
 a
 lot
 of


attention
 whether
 it
 was
 true
 or
 not.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 then
 a
 few
 days
 later,


we
 published
 a
 piece
 that
 walked
 readers


through
 how
 fraud
 got
 so
 pervasive
 in


Minnesota
 and
 that
 examined
 the
 role


racism
 and
 politics
 played
 in
 allowing


it
 to
 metastasize
 over
 the
 years.
 And


all
 this
 was
 happening
 at
 the
 same
 time


as
 people
 in
 the
 nation's
 capital
 were


reeling
 from
 that
 horrific
 shooting
 of


two
 members
 of
 the
 National
 Guard.


The
 gunman
 in
 that
 case
 was
 an
 Afghan


man
 who
 had
 been
 admitted
 in
 recent


years
 into
 the
 country.
 And
 I
 think
 that


added
 an
 element
 that
 the
 administration


had
 more
 political
 cover
 to
 be
 more


draconian
 in
 its
 immigration
 crackdown,


particularly
 as
 it
 pertained
 to


countries
 that
 are
 riven
 with


instability
 and
 conflict.


>> Right?
 This
 has
 really
 become
 a
 moment


where
 the
 administration
 has
 turned
 its


focus
 to
 specific
 groups
 of
 immigrants


from
 places
 that,
 as
 you
 said,
 have
 a


reputation
 for
 instability,
 for


conflict.
 And
 the
 message
 the
 White


House
 has
 been
 sending
 about
 these


people
 is
 that
 they're
 importing


cultures
 into
 America
 that
 are
 not


welcome.
 You
 know,
 Steven
 Miller,


Trump's
 domestic
 policy
 adviser,


recently
 posted
 this
 on
 social
 media.
 He


said,
 quote,
 "No
 magic
 transformation


occurs
 when
 people
 from
 failed
 states


cross
 borders."
 And
 then
 in
 his
 comments


on
 Tuesday,
 Trump
 seems
 to
 pick
 up
 right


where
 Miller
 left
 off.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 the
 desire
 by


President
 Trump
 and
 people
 in
 his
 circle


to
 limit
 immigration
 from
 specific


countries
 dates
 back
 to
 his
 first
 term,


obviously,
 and
 was
 met
 with
 tremendous


push
 back
 both
 from
 the
 public
 and
 from


the
 courts.
 I
 think
 now
 though
 they
 may


feel
 that
 they
 have
 a
 little
 more


leverage
 to
 push
 this
 through,
 to
 get


more
 people
 in
 handcuffs
 and
 out
 of
 the


country
 and
 to
 close
 the
 door
 to


American
 immigration
 based
 on


nationality.
 And
 at
 that
 cabinet
 meeting


on
 Tuesday,
 President
 Trump
 said
 the


United
 States
 was
 at
 a
 crossroads.


>> You
 know,
 our
 country
 is
 at
 a
 tipping


point.
 We
 could
 go
 bad.
 We're
 at
 a


tipping
 point.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 people


mind
 me
 saying
 that,
 but
 I'm
 saying
 it.


Uh,
 we
 could
 go
 one
 way
 or
 the
 other.


>> He
 said
 that
 he
 was
 fed
 up
 with
 people


coming
 here
 from
 impoverished,


conflictridden
 countries
 and
 as
 he
 sees


it,
 leeching
 off
 the
 welfare
 state.


>> The
 welfare
 is
 like
 88%.


They
 contribute
 nothing.


I
 don't
 want
 them
 in
 our
 country.
 I'll


be
 honest
 with
 you.
 Okay.
 Somebody
 would


say,
 "Oh,
 that's
 not
 politically


correct."
 I
 don't
 care.
 I
 don't
 want


them
 in
 our
 country.
 Their
 country
 is
 no


good
 for
 a
 reason.
 Their
 country
 stakes.


>> It
 also
 just
 strikes
 me
 that
 this
 is
 all


happening,
 this
 conversation
 so
 much


more
 out
 in
 the
 open
 than
 it
 was
 in


Trump's
 first
 term.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 us
 will
 remember
 the
 comment
 that


Trump
 made
 about
 hole
 countries.


That
 was
 behind
 closed
 doors.
 That
 was
 a


comment
 made
 in
 private
 that
 was
 later


revealed.
 Now
 he's
 doing
 this
 in
 front


of
 his
 cabinet,
 in
 front
 of
 the
 cameras


rolling.


Yeah,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 sense
 that
 in


this
 current
 era,
 they
 feel
 emboldened


to
 say
 the
 quiet
 part
 out
 loud
 and
 to


say
 things
 that
 would
 have
 been


unimaginable
 and
 careerending
 for


mainstream
 politicians
 in
 the
 not


[snorts]
 tooistant
 past.
 But
 all
 of
 a


sudden,
 we
 are
 seeing
 these
 ideas
 and


these
 notions
 become
 mainstream
 policies


and
 mainstream
 subjects
 of
 debate.
 And


to
 be
 clear,
 the
 people
 that
 Trump
 is


talking
 about
 here
 are
 Somali,
 most
 of


whom
 you've
 told
 us
 have
 legal
 status
 or


are
 citizens.
 So
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 given


that,
 what
 do
 you
 expect
 the
 ICE


operations
 to
 look
 like
 there?
 I
 mean,


what
 are
 they
 going
 to
 do?
 Who
 are
 they


looking
 for?
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a


very
 challenging
 mission
 for
 ICE
 and
 I


think
 it's
 likely
 to
 look
 very
 different


from
 what
 we've
 seen
 earlier
 this
 year


in
 places
 like
 Chicago
 or
 Los
 Angeles.


You
 know,
 for
 starters,
 the
 number
 of


people
 who
 may
 be
 subject
 to
 deportation


appears
 to
 be
 pretty
 small.
 We
 may
 be


talking
 about
 just
 a
 few
 hundred
 people


who
 may
 have
 outstanding
 deportation


orders
 and
 who
 can
 sort
 of
 be
 put
 into


the
 system.
 And
 there's
 kind
 of
 a
 more


mundane
 challenge
 and
 that
 is
 that
 this


week
 has
 been
 bone
 chilling
 in
 Minnesota


and
 people
 are
 spending
 as
 little
 time


as
 possible
 on
 the
 streets
 and
 agents
 I


think
 are
 facing
 real
 pain
 if
 they're


out
 and
 about
 knocking
 on
 doors,
 staking


out
 businesses
 and
 residences.
 That
 in


and
 of
 itself
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


monumental
 challenge
 for
 ICE.
 Can
 we


pull
 back
 here
 for
 a
 minute?
 Because


it's
 worth
 saying
 what
 we're
 seeing
 here


isn't
 just
 an
 immigration
 operation.


Trump's
 comments
 and
 these
 actions
 seem


to
 be
 just
 as
 much
 about
 delegitimizing


a
 group
 of
 people
 who
 either
 immigrated


here
 and
 became
 American
 citizens
 or


their
 parents
 did.
 The
 president
 is


calling
 into
 question
 their
 Americanness


and
 really
 calling
 into
 question
 whether


your
 ability
 as
 an
 immigrant
 or
 a
 child


of
 immigrants
 to
 call
 yourself
 an


American
 depends
 on
 where
 you're
 from.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 really
 painful


question
 that
 Somali
 immigrants
 are
 now


wrestling
 with
 is,
 you
 know,
 what
 do
 you


do
 to
 prove
 that
 you're
 an
 American?


like
 to
 what
 length
 do
 you
 need
 to
 go
 to


truly
 feel
 like
 you
 belong
 and
 that


you're
 part
 of
 the
 fabric
 of
 this


nation?
 We're
 talking
 about
 people
 in


many
 cases
 who
 were
 born
 here
 and
 have


known
 no
 other
 homeland.
 Others
 arrived


here
 decades
 ago
 and
 have
 long


considered
 themselves
 patriots
 who
 have


been
 helping
 build
 the
 state,
 paying


taxes,
 working
 in
 really
 difficult
 jobs.


So
 yeah,
 I
 think
 this
 really
 leaves


people
 with
 unsettling
 questions
 about


what
 they
 need
 to
 do
 to
 be
 brought
 into


the
 fold
 of
 this
 country
 in
 this


political
 era
 and
 just
 how
 much
 further


will
 this
 crackdown
 and
 this
 cloud
 of


suspicion
 reach?
 What
 shape
 could
 this


take
 in
 the
 months
 ahead?
 And
 I'd


imagine
 whether
 their
 Americanness
 could


be
 called
 into
 question
 anytime
 a
 single


or
 a
 few
 members
 of
 their
 community
 make


a
 mistake.


>> Absolutely.
 You
 know,
 we've
 heard
 from


local
 elected
 officials
 who
 say
 they're


deeply
 concerned
 that
 the
 stage
 is
 set


for
 widespread
 civil
 rights
 violations.


>> The
 vast
 majority
 of
 our
 Somali


community
 are
 citizens.
 So
 what
 he
 who


he
 just
 attacked
 isn't
 just
 Somali.
 Who


he
 attacked
 is
 Somali
 Americans.
 who
 he


attacked
 as
 Americans.


>> St.
 Paul
 Mayor
 Melvin
 Carter
 look
 back


to
 history.


>> I
 believe
 that
 the
 sacred
 moments
 in


American
 history
 are
 the
 moments
 we've


had
 to
 decide
 who
 gets
 to
 be
 included
 in


the
 Wii.
 Do
 we
 mean
 black
 people?
 Do
 we


mean
 women?
 Do
 we
 mean
 immigrants?
 Who


is
 a
 part
 of
 the
 Wii
 when
 we
 say
 we
 the


people?
 And
 he
 said
 we
 should
 be


thinking
 of
 this
 moment
 as
 one
 that
 may


define
 who
 we
 are
 as
 Americans
 and
 as
 a


nation.


>> And
 Ernesto,
 what
 about
 the
 reckoning


that
 you
 described
 happening
 in


Minnesota
 around
 the
 original
 scandal


that
 prompted
 all
 of
 this,
 the
 fraud?
 I


mean,
 you
 had
 said
 that
 the
 state
 was


really
 starting
 to
 have
 a
 conversation


about
 how
 this
 fear
 of
 being
 perceived


as
 racist
 or
 called
 racist,
 the
 fear
 of


a
 backlash
 had
 led
 to
 this
 very


well-intentioned
 system
 being
 totally


corrupted.
 Where
 does
 that
 conversation


stand
 now?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 fascinating
 to


watch
 how
 this
 unfolds
 in
 the
 months


ahead.


You
 know,
 on
 the
 one
 hand,
 we're
 in
 a


moment
 where
 nobody
 can
 turn
 a
 blind
 eye


to
 the
 fact
 that
 fraud
 is
 a
 huge
 and


systemic
 problem
 for
 Minnesota.
 There's


going
 to
 be
 a
 governor's
 election
 next


year.
 And
 [music]
 Tim
 Walls,
 who's
 a


Democrat,
 could
 lose
 that
 race
 if


[music]
 the
 people
 who
 are
 challenging


him
 on
 the
 right
 from
 the
 Republican


party
 succeed
 in
 making
 [music]
 fraud


the
 defining
 issue
 in
 the
 race.


I
 think
 there's
 broad
 agreement
 that
 you


need
 systemic
 change
 and
 that
 you
 need


strong
 safeguards.
 And
 I
 think
 also


we're
 starting
 to
 see
 a
 reckoning
 among


people
 in
 the
 Somali
 community
 about
 the


fact
 that
 this
 is
 a
 big
 problem
 and
 has


created
 a
 significant
 perception
 issue


that
 many
 people
 are
 now
 paying
 the


price
 for.
 [music]


But
 just
 as
 you
 know,
 Minnesota
 seemed


ready
 to
 start
 having
 a
 more
 frank
 and


constructive
 conversation
 about
 race
 and


even
 to
 just
 talk
 about
 the
 fact
 that


Somali
 were
 largely
 responsible
 for


these
 cases
 of
 fraud.
 It's
 now
 been


bulldozed
 by
 the
 debate
 over
 immigration


and
 the
 xenophobic
 rhetoric
 that
 we're


hearing
 from
 the
 president.


>> Right?


>> It's
 going
 to
 be
 really
 hard
 to


disentangle
 these
 two
 issues.
 [music]


And
 I
 think
 the
 pragmatic
 change
 that


you
 know
 will
 likely
 happen
 in
 the


months
 ahead
 [music]


is
 going
 to
 be
 really
 hard
 to
 divorce


from
 the
 national
 politics.


[music]


[music]


>> Well,
 Ernesto,
 thanks
 so
 much.


>> Natalie,
 it's
 been
 a
 pleasure.


>> [music]


>> We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.


On
 Wednesday,
 [music]


President
 Trump
 announced
 a
 plan
 to


weaken
 fuel
 efficiency
 requirements
 for


tens
 of
 millions
 of
 new
 cars
 and
 light


trucks,
 [music]


calling
 them
 a
 scam.
 It
 was
 his
 latest


move
 to
 [music]
 gut
 fuel
 restrictions


put
 in
 place
 by
 the
 Biden
 administration


to
 help
 address
 climate
 change.
 [music]


Trump
 said
 the
 efficiency
 requirements


made
 cars
 too
 costly
 for
 automakers
 to


build
 [music]
 and
 too
 expensive
 for


Americans
 to
 buy.
 The
 administration


claimed
 the
 new
 [music]
 rules
 would


shave
 $1,000
 off
 the
 cost
 of
 a
 new
 car.


>> [music]


>> And
 in
 a
 report
 that's
 scheduled
 to
 be


released
 on
 Thursday,
 the
 Pentagon's


acting
 inspector
 general
 said
 that


defense
 secretary
 Pete
 Hgsith
 [music]


risked
 endangering
 American
 troops


earlier
 this
 year
 when
 he
 used
 a
 private


messaging
 [music]
 app
 to
 discuss


military
 plans.
 The
 Pentagon's
 internal


inquiry
 [music]
 centered
 on
 Hexath's


role
 in
 a
 group
 chat
 on
 Signal,
 the


encrypted
 messaging
 app,
 [music]
 where


he
 discussed
 imminent
 strikes
 in
 Yemen


with
 other
 senior
 Trump
 officials.


The
 chat
 became
 public
 [music]
 because
 a


journalist
 was
 added
 to
 the
 group
 by


mistake.


Today's
 episode
 [music]
 was
 produced
 by


Diana
 Wyn,
 Nina
 Feldman,
 and
 Stella
 Tan.


It
 was
 edited
 by
 MJ
 Davis
 Lynn
 [music]


and
 Michael
 Benois.
 Contains
 music

 Etup
 and

 Lozano.
 And
 was

 Moxley.


That's
 it
 for

 See
 you
 tomorrow.
