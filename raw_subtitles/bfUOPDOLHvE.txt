This August, President Trump signed an executive 
order allowing private equity firms to tap into  
America’s 401(k) system. The stated goal was 
to democratize access — to stop babying smaller  
investors and to let them play in the same 
sandbox as pension funds and sovereign wealth  
fund managers - nothing says ‘democratization’ 
like handing your retirement savings to Apollo.
 
So why are the shares of publicly listed 
private equity firms underperforming the  
broader stock market so badly this 
year? You’d expect a rally. Instead,  
the GLPE index is down nearly 10% year to date – 
and it’s even down slightly since the announcement  
in early August. Apollo and Blue Owl are off 
more than 20% year to date - KKR, Ares, and  
TPG are all in double-digit decline. Blackstone 
is down too, with Carlyle and 3i being outliers,  
up more than the S&P. It turns out - that letting 
retail investors into the sandbox doesn’t help  
if the sandbox is full of broken toys.
The Wall Street Journal points out that  
some of the underperformance might reflect an 
overhang from the run-up in stock prices over  
the last few years— especially for some of the 
big firms who rallied ahead of being included  
in the S&P 500. But there are still concerns 
hanging over the industry. Private equity firms  
are struggling to sell prior investments 
at attractive prices - and without exits,  
there are no distributions. Without distributions, 
it’s much harder to raise new capital. 
 
Private equity is still sitting on trillions 
in assets. But the flywheel — raise, deploy,  
exit, distribute, and repeat — isn’t spinning 
the way it used to. And the push into 401(k)s  
looks maybe less like innovation and 
more like a search for new investors  
when the existing ones are getting frustrated.
The S&P 500 is up around 14% this year – if we  
include dividends, but it hasn’t been a 
broad-based rally. The returns have been  
concentrated in a handful of tech giants 
— the Magnificent Seven minus Tesla plus  
Broadcom — which make up more than a third of 
the index. These firms are growing earnings,  
throwing off cash, and doing it with less leverage 
than their predecessors in the dot-com era.  
Investors have been paying up for profitability, 
and the market has been rewarding them.
 
Private equity doesn’t own these companies 
– and it doesn’t own anything like them. PE  
firms tend to own smaller businesses, often 
in slower-growing sectors, and usually with  
a lot more debt. The typical buyout fund is a 
leveraged bet on small-cap value stocks — the  
exact corner of the market that’s been lagging. 
It’s not unreasonable to expect private equity  
returns to rise and fall with the broader market, 
adjusted for the additional leverage. But that  
relationship breaks down when the market is being 
driven by a narrow set of megacap tech stocks  
that private equity funds have no exposure to. 
The IPO market has been dead for quite a while,  
and the kinds of companies sitting in private 
equity portfolios simply aren’t what public  
investors are looking for. Investors are not 
interested in paying top dollar for slow-growth  
businesses with heavy debt loads — and that’s 
making it harder for PE firms to exit cleanly.
 
Benchmarking private equity against the S&P 500 
has always been a bit of a stretch. The sector  
invests mostly in U.S. companies, but they’re 
smaller, more cyclical, and more heavily levered.  
A better comparison might be a basket of small-cap 
value stocks with a few turns of debt layered on  
top. But even that’s generous. Most small-cap 
value ETFs don’t charge fees of 2 and 20.
 
Private equity is often described as an asset 
class, but it’s really just a structure.  
Most of the capital is deployed through 
buyout funds, which acquire controlling  
stakes in private companies using a mix of equity 
and debt. The debt does most of the heavy lifting.  
A typical deal might be financed with 60 to 75 
percent leverage — far more than you’d find in a  
publicly listed company, where debt-to-equity 
ratios tend to hover around 30 percent.

The idea behind Private Equity is simple:  
borrow heavily, buy a business, improve it 
(or at least manage it somewhat efficiently),  
and then try to sell it later for more 
than you paid. The returns are supposed  
to come from operational improvements, multiple 
expansion, and — most reliably — leverage. The  
people picking the companies to buy - often have 
backgrounds in investment banking or consulting.  
Whether that qualifies them to run a plumbing 
supply company – and whether they can run it  
better than its founder did - is a separate 
question. But hey, if you can model a leveraged  
buyout in Excel, how hard can toilets be?
Private equity funds tend to concentrate their  
bets in smaller companies, often in mature 
industries — the reason being that steady,  
if boring, business models are easier to borrow 
against – no one wants to lend money to a business  
with negative – or even highly variable cashflows. 
That gives them exposure to the small-cap  
and value factors tracked by academic finance – 
historically these factors outperformed – but that  
hasn’t happened for quite some time. They also 
claim to offer access to the illiquidity premium:  
the idea is that buying hard-to-sell assets at 
a discount, and locking up investor capital for  
years, should result in higher long-term returns. 
Whether that premium exists is debatable. What’s  
clear is that the fees are high, the leverage 
is substantial, and the exit routes are narrow.
 
Private equity firms like to tell a story. It’s 
a story about transformation — of taking sleepy,  
underperforming companies and turning them 
into lean, efficient, high-growth machines.  
The protagonists are former investment 
bankers and consultants who, armed with  
spreadsheets and strategic vision, unlock 
hidden value through operational excellence.  
This is the myth of operational alpha.
But the numbers tell a somewhat different story.
 
Most of the returns in private equity 
come not from operational improvements,  
but from leverage. A typical buyout is 
financed with 60–75% debt — significantly more  
than the 30% average for public companies. That 
leverage amplifies returns when things go well.  
It also introduces fragility, but that part of 
the story is usually left out of the pitch deck.
 
The idea that private equity managers are uniquely 
skilled at running businesses is hard to square  
with the resumes of many general partners. These 
are usually people with backgrounds in M&A,  
not manufacturing. They know how to structure 
a deal – but next to nothing about how to run  
a plumbing supply company. The founder they’re 
replacing with a junior banker - may have spent  
30 years building the business in question. The 
new owners have a five-year exit horizon – the  
ability to borrow huge sums of money - and 
a model that assumes margin expansion.
 
You may be surprised to hear - that margin 
expansion rarely materializes. Bain’s 2025  
global private equity report shows that in the 
software businesses that they buy out — margin  
growth has contributed just 6% to value creation 
over the last decade. The rest of the return came  
from revenue growth and multiple expansion. In 
carve-outs — transactions where a private equity  
firm acquires a non-core division or subsidiary 
from a larger corporation — the story is similar:  
pre-2012, sponsors boosted margins by 29%. 
Since then, that figure has fallen to 2%.
 
Even when operational improvements are real, 
they’re often overstated. As Ludovic Phalippou  
and others have pointed out, the industry’s 
preferred performance metric — since-inception  
IRR — is highly sensitive to the timing of cash 
flows and can be gamed through subscription lines  
and bridge loans. It’s not a rate of return in 
any meaningful sense. It’s a marketing number  
or the financial equivalent of Instagram filters 
— flattering, but often nothing like reality.
 
Warren Buffett has long criticized the private 
equity model for this reason. At Berkshire  
Hathaway’s 2019 meeting, he noted that investors 
in PE funds must hold cash on the sidelines,  
ready to be called. That cash earns 
very little (especially during the  
zero-interest rate environment of the 
time), but that doesn’t show up in the  
IRR. The result is a flattering returns number 
that ignores the real-world cost of capital.
 
None of this is to say that private equity 
firms never improve the businesses they buy.  
Some do. But the industry’s aggregate returns 
— especially in recent years — suggest that  
operational alpha is more aspiration than 
reality. The real engine of private equity  
is leverage. And in a world of higher interest 
rates, that engine is starting to sputter.
 
Private equity has long sold itself as a 
source of stability. In a world of whipsawing  
public markets, Private Equity appears to offer 
smooth, upward-sloping returns. The lines on the  
performance charts are reassuringly linear. 
But as Cliff Asness of AQR famously put it,  
this isn’t stability — it’s just stale pricing.
The smoothing of returns in private equity is by  
no means a bug. It’s a feature — and, for quite 
some time has been a major selling point. Because  
private assets aren’t marked to market, their 
prices don’t fluctuate with daily headlines or  
quarterly earnings like publicly listed stocks do. 
Instead, they’re occasionally appraised - often by  
the fund managers themselves or by third 
parties hired by them. This creates the  
illusion of low volatility – I remember speaking 
to a Private Equity fund manager during the credit  
crunch – who claimed that while every asset in 
the world had collapsed in value – none of his  
portfolio companies had even ticked down. 
The fact that these investments conceal  
their true volatility is actually appealing to 
institutional investors bound by solvency rules  
or performance metrics that penalize drawdowns.
This illusion – however - comes at a cost. As an  
article on the CFA Institute’s website argues 
- the industry’s reliance on since-inception  
internal rate of return (IRR) as a performance 
metric is deeply misleading. IRR is not a rate  
of return in any meaningful economic sense – in 
that it is not a return that any private equity  
investor receives. It’s more of a mathematical 
artefact, highly sensitive to the timing of cash  
flows and easily manipulated through subscription 
lines, bridge loans, and delayed capital calls.
 
Consider a common tactic: a fund identifies a 
deal but delays calling capital from investors,  
instead they use a short-term loan to finance the 
acquisition. This shortens the measured holding  
period and inflates the IRR, even though the 
underlying economics haven’t changed. The fund  
looks like it’s delivering a 25% return, when in 
reality the investor’s actual return — accounting  
for idle cash and fees — may be closer to 
10%. The investors money has been sitting  
in bonds – waiting for the capital call – 
and instead of taking it – the fund borrows  
money (at a higher interest rate) just so that 
they can show an artificially inflated IRR.
 
Then there’s the proliferation of continuation 
funds. These are vehicles that allow a PE firm  
to sell an asset from one of its funds to another 
fund it also manages – and charges fees on. The  
transaction resets the clock, generates a paper 
gain in the first fund, creating the appearance  
of a successful exit. But the asset hasn’t 
changed hands in any meaningful way. It’s  
a bit like selling your house to yourself 
at a higher price and declaring a profit.
 
The Bain 2025 report notes that nearly 30% of 
companies in buyout portfolios have undergone some  
form of liquidity event — including secondaries, 
dividend recaps, and NAV loans — without a true  
exit. These financial maneuvers generate cash 
flow and flattering metrics, but they don’t  
necessarily reflect real value creation.
This chart from Bloomberg shows that over  
the last few years – the businesses held on to 
in continuation funds are transferred at higher  
valuations than the ones actually exited from.
Investors are starting to notice. Distributions  
to paid-in capital (DPI) — a more grounded 
measure of actual cash returned — has become  
the metric of choice for many limited partners. 
And by that measure, the recent vintages are  
underwhelming. Funds launched in 2019 are only 
just breaking even and some may never get there.
 
The smoothing of returns may help investors 
sleep at night. But it also obscures risk,  
conceals underperformance, and makes it harder 
to distinguish skill from luck. In the end,  
volatility laundering as this technique has been 
named by Cliff Asness at AQR - is just that:  
laundering. In the end, it’s not true stability 
- it’s opacity dressed up as sophistication.
 
Private equity’s promise of smooth returns 
is now colliding with a hard reality:  
the industry is struggling to convert paper 
gains into actual cash. The backlog of unsold  
companies now exceeds $3.6 trillion across 
nearly 30,000 portfolio firms. Distributions  
have slowed to a crawl. Bain’s 2025 
report shows that distributions as  
a percentage of net asset value have fallen 
to 11% — the lowest rate in over a decade.
 
The IPO market is comatose. Strategic 
buyers are cautious. Sponsor-to-sponsor  
deals — once a reliable exit route — are now 
viewed with suspicion. Continuation funds,  
secondaries, and NAV loans have stepped 
in to provide liquidity, but they’re more  
accounting maneuvers than genuine exits. 
Liquidity challenges are also distorting  
valuations. When assets are never actually sold – 
you have to start wondering about their carrying  
value. Secondary market discounts — often 15% or 
more — reveal what investors really think these  
assets are worth. And that’s before accounting 
for fees, leverage, and the time value of money.
 
The collapse of First Brands- which I covered a 
few weeks ago – and which is becoming a bigger  
and bigger story - illustrates the fragility 
of the system. First Brands borrowed heavily,  
pledged the same collateral multiple times, and 
relied on opaque invoice financing structures.  
When it failed, $2.3 billion dollars in 
assets simply vanished. Creditors are still  
trying to trace the money. The parallels 
to Greensill are obvious — and troubling.
 
Private credit, which up until now has been 
marketed as a disciplined alternative to bank  
lending, now looks more like a blind spot. The 
bespoke contracts and bilateral relationships  
that were supposed to offer flexibility instead 
just concealed problems. Pension funds and  
insurers who invested - now find themselves 
exposed to risks they barely understand.
 
The liquidity crunch is also a psychological 
reckoning. Investors are asking hard questions:  
What are these assets really worth? When 
will I get my money back? Why does the fund  
keep reporting gains when they can’t seem 
to sell anything to outside investors?
 
Until those questions have better answers, 
the industry’s reputation for stability will  
remain under pressure. The returns 
may still look smooth on paper — but  
the path to realizing them is anything but.
In August, Donald Trump signed an executive  
order that could reshape the retirement landscape 
for millions of Americans. The order allows 401(k)  
plan administrators to include private equity and 
other alternative assets – like cryptocurrencies  
- in defined contribution retirement plans. The 
move was cheered by Apollo, BlackRock, Carlyle,  
and other firms that have spent years lobbying 
for access to the growing retirement market.
 
The pitch is that these assets offer 
diversification, potentially higher returns,  
and access to institutional-grade investments. 
But the risks are less widely advertised.  
Private equity funds come with high fees, 
long lockups, and limited transparency.  
They’re not priced daily, and they’re not easy 
to exit. For retail investors, that’s a very  
different proposition than buying an index fund.
The lobbying effort behind the order was intense.  
According to financial disclosures, Apollo and 
Carlyle pushed hard for regulatory changes.  
Blackstone worked through trade associations. Marc 
Rowan of Apollo argued that the retirement system  
was overexposed to megacap tech stocks — “we’ve 
basically leveraged the retirement system of the  
country to Nvidia,” he said. The solution, in his 
view, was to open the gates to private markets.
 
Some firms went further. The Defined Contribution 
Alternatives Association reportedly argued that  
401(k) plans could be sued for not offering 
access to private equity. Their logic being - if  
PE delivers higher returns, then excluding it 
could be seen as a breach of fiduciary duty. That  
argument may be legally tenuous, but it reflects 
either the industry’s confidence — or desperation  
– I’ll let you be the judge of that.
The Bain 2025 report notes that retail  
capital is now expected to drive much of the 
industry’s future growth. Semiliquid products,  
target-date funds, and model portfolios are being 
designed to mix public and private assets and the  
big private equity firms have all announced 
partnerships with retirement plan providers.
 
I’m not sure to what extent American investors 
will fall for this pitch – the one thing most  
investors have learned over the years is 
that high fee investments reduce returns.  
Average expense ratios paid by investors has 
been falling year after year – as investors  
refuse to pay up for underperformance.
The industries push into 401(k)s looks  
less like democratization and more like a 
search for new capital. When the existing  
investors are frustrated, find new ones.
When people from the world of finance  
criticize private equity, they often focus on 
fees and performance. But outside the world  
of finance there is plenty of criticism over 
the industry’s impact on society. What happens  
when ownership is distant, incentives are 
misaligned, and the goal is wealth extraction  
rather than growth and customer focus.
The moral critique centers on the social  
consequences of financial engineering. 
Congressional investigations into  
private equity-owned dental chains have 
raised questions about care quality and  
unnecessary procedures being pushed on patients 
in the pursuit of profits. Critics argue that  
the pursuit of EBITDA growth can lead to 
anti-social outcomes — from understaffed  
care homes to hollowed-out retailers.
There is also antitrust concern around  
private equity roll-up strategies, where 
PE firms buy dozens of small businesses  
in fragmented industries — like doctors’ 
offices, private schools, restaurants,  
or student housing — and consolidate them into 
platform companies. The result can be reduced  
competition and higher costs for consumers.
Private equity thrived in a world of cheap debt.  
For most of its modern history, the industry 
operated in a structurally falling interest  
rate environment. That tailwind is now gone.
A huge component of the business model relies  
on leverage. Buyout firms typically finance 
acquisitions with 60–75% debt. When rates were  
near zero, that was cheap and effective. 
But as interest rates have gone up over  
the last two years, the cost of debt soared. 
Suddenly, the math doesn’t work that well.
 
Higher rates mean higher financing 
costs, lower valuations, and fewer  
exits. Sellers want yesterday’s prices 
- while buyers can’t afford them. 
 
Many PE-backed companies now carry six to eight 
times EBITDA in debt — levels typically associated  
with junk credit. When interest rates rise, 
bankruptcy risk rises with them and the private  
equity model starts to look a lot more fragile.
Private equity firms argue that they can operate  
in any business environment – but with inflation, 
tariffs, and policy uncertainty – all of which hit  
small businesses harder than large businesses 
it has become increasingly difficult to  
underwrite new deals with any confidence.
Private equity has always pitched itself  
as a sophisticated alternative to public 
markets. It claims to offer diversification,  
excess returns, and stability. But the 
reality is more complicated than that...
 
The returns are driven by leverage and 
the stability may be an illusion — like a  
toddler’s drawing of a rollercoaster labeled 
“steady growth.” The diversification – well  
that’s mostly concentrated bets on 
small, cyclical businesses that panic  
at the sight of higher interest rates. 
As the industry expands into 401(k)s  
and retail products, the pitch is being 
repackaged. But the fundamentals haven’t  
changed. The fees are high. The exits are 
uncertain. And the returns are shrinking.
 
Retail investors are being sold a feature 
— but they may instead be buying a bug. 
 
The mirage of sophistication is powerful. But 
eventually, the water seen in the distance has to  
be real. And for private equity, that means actual 
exits, actual distributions, and fewer PowerPoint  
slides about “transformational value creation.”
Until then, the industry may look smooth on  
paper — but it’s starting to sound 
like a bedtime story told by someone  
who’s already spent your retirement.
