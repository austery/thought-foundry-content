- Meet Matthew Johnson.
- I'm Matt Johnson.
I'm a professor of psychiatry
and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins.
I study drugs, all kinds of drugs:
uppers, downers, all-arounders.
The drug class that I've studied most
over the last, nearly couple of decades,
are the psychedelic compounds.
- Why are psychedelics unique among drugs?
- I developed an interest in
drugs, including psychedelics,
over 25 years ago in my early 20s.
I was fascinated by the history
of psychedelics in our culture;
the fact that there was medical
research in the early days;
and I just had this growing fascination
with psychoactive compounds in general.
The idea that any of these substances,
whether we're talking about
cocaine, caffeine, you name it,
including the psychedelics,
how these things affect our behavior,
how you put these small amounts
of a substance in your body,
and they can have, at
times, radical changes
in your subjective
experience and what you do.
It's hard to imagine a more
interdisciplinary topic
in the realm of drugs than psychedelics.
I mean, psychedelics crosscut
so many interesting domains.
They've apparently been
used for time immemorial
by indigenous cultures
throughout many different
cultures on the planet.
In our own Western cultural history,
they really exploded on
the scene in the 1960s,
and were associated
with some really radical
changes to society.
And what really is most interesting,
to me, as someone who's really focused
on the effects of drugs on behavior-
whether it's the good, the bad, the ugly-
psychedelics are the only
drug class that I know of
where you have not just one or two,
but lots of stories
of people saying they
took this thing one time,
some decades ago, maybe 50 years ago,
and they say it had this profound impact
on the course of their entire life.
You know, I can't think
of another drug class
where people claim therapeutic
or beneficial effects of any type
when they used it only one time.
I mean, you take cannabis,
you know, plenty of examples
of therapeutic effects,
but I've never met anybody
who said they smoked pot
one time 20 years ago,
never touched it again,
and yet they can point
to how this has radically
improved their life.
Those stories are countless
with psychedelics.
Not everybody, plenty
of people just try them,
and they have fun, and that's it.
But it's surprisingly common for people
to say really outlandish things,
like Kary Mullis won the
Nobel Prize inventing PCR,
which revolutionized biology.
He said he wouldn't have
been able to do that
had he not had experience
in taking psychedelics.
You move into the arts
and then, I mean, gosh,
I mean, who hasn't heard of musicians
and other artists claiming
that psychedelics had a profound
impact on their creativity?
I mean, I remember when
I was coming of age
and my late teens,
discovering the music
of earlier generations,
and, "Hey, there's this
band people have heard of,
probably called The Beatles, you know?
And wow, they're pretty good."
But then you explore their music,
and there's The Beatles before LSD,
and then there's The Beatles after LSD.
That's a big shift,
and a lot of folks like the Beatles
after LSD, especially so.
- What does the term 'psychedelic' mean?
- Okay, so the term 'psychedelic'
was coined by Humphry Osmond,
who was writing letters, back
when people wrote letters,
to Aldous Huxley.
And they were sending
letters back and forth-
they had a friendship-and
they were discussing,
they were both profoundly
intrigued by this new class of drugs.
And they were trading ideas
about what the ideal name
for this new drug class would be.
And Huxley came up with
some unpronounceable term
that Humphry Osmond dismissed.
And let's see if I can recall the poem
that Osmond wrote to Huxley.
He said, "To fathom hell or soar angelic,
just take a pinch of psychedelic."
And what psychedelic means,
from its linguistic roots,
is "mind manifesting."
And so I'd say that's a pretty good term.
There's no perfect term
for this drug class.
Certainly hallucinogen,
which is often used
is not a great term
'cause very rarely do people
have true hallucinations,
and there's a misunderstanding
of what that means.
But the psychedelic,
the idea that these are mind manifesting,
that's consistent with this other notion
that these are non-specific amplifiers.
In other words, you could
have a euphoric experience,
you could have a hellish experience.
You name it in the realm of
human experience and emotions,
that can be your experience,
and it could be amplified.
And it's very much a product
of what's going on in
your life at the time.
It's not this reliable effect.
So it seems like manifesting the mind,
digging deeper into the mind,
amplifying what is
already there in the mind,
that sort of generally fits
with clinical observations
with these drugs.
Terminology is so difficult in this area,
and even the experts will disagree.
Psychedelic can be used to refer
to what are called the 'classic
psychedelic compounds':
psilocybin, which is in magic mushrooms,
LSD, DMT, which is in ayahuasca,
mescaline, which is in peyote-
those are the classic psychedelics.
They affect a certain particular
type of serotonin receptor,
and that's their primary
mechanism of action.
But then you have other drugs
that are called psychedelic,
and I think it's appropriate
to call them psychedelic.
Other scientists will disagree,
but they have a different mechanism.
They're not classic psychedelics.
So for example, MDMA will
work by releasing serotonin;
so that's a different mechanism.
And its effects are different
than the classic psychedelics,
typically not as intense,
typically more focused on
one's emotional experience,
more of a heart trip than a head trip.
And you have other
drugs, such as ketamine.
So that affects the glutamate
system in the brain primarily
rather than the serotonin system.
Even though there's evidence
that the classic psychedelics
downstream for serotonin,
they also affect glutamate.
But nonetheless, the drugs
like ketamine and PCP,
which are in the same class as each other,
they initially affect the
glutamatergic system in the brain.
So what does psychedelic mean, then,
if it refers to multiple
underlying classes,
pharmacological classes of drugs
that work in different ways?
And the answer for me is
that these are all drugs
that can have a profound effect
on one's sense of reality,
including one's sense of self.
And I would say that
typically isn't the case
for what we think of as the stimulants
or the sedatives or the opioids.
People feel different,
but not as extremely as with
these psychedelic compounds.
- What is hallucinogen
versus entheogen versus psychedelic?
- When I first started in
psychedelic research in 2004,
it was hard to get a paper published
using the word psychedelic.
Hallucinogen, by far,
was the preferred term
in academia in science.
Thankfully, that's changed.
And I think it's because
enough scientists, like myself,
kept trying to use the term,
in arguing that it's a better term.
You know, hallucinogen, one,
the reasons I don't like
hallucinogen as a term,
is that it focuses on
the perceptual realm,
which a lot of people
who aren't very familiar
with psychedelics,
they just assume that's
the primary mechanism.
In other words,
someone will hear about some
of the research and say,
"I don't get it, why would
seeing things, hallucinations,
what are you seeing, pink elephants,
and that makes you want to quit smoking?
Like, I don't get it," people will say.
And that's 'cause they're focused
on this perceptual aspect of psychedelics.
And probably the reason
that the perceptual effects
have gotten so much attention
is those are the aspects
that are easier to describe.
Like, "Yeah, the walls look
like they were waving."
That's not normal.
I can describe what that is.
Like, what the hell is going on?
Trying to wrap language
around dissolving the sense of identity,
having some sense of who I am
beyond the normal descriptors,
you know, "I'm so old, I'm a male,
I'm this, I'm from this country,"
all these ways we define ourselves,
just when they're completely
stripped away and what's left,
I mean, we're getting into
deep philosophical realms there
that are really hard to describe.
It's easy to describe, "I
saw some crazy-ass colors."
So I think this is sort of stuck,
the focus on perceptual
effects has sort of stuck
as sort of the lay understanding
of what these drugs do.
Hallucinogen, therefore, it focuses
on this one relatively arbitrary aspect
of psychedelic effects.
And that's why, actually, in therapy,
one of the reasons we have
people wear eye shades
is we don't want them
focusing the entire time
on the wavy walls and the intense colors.
And that's great. It's
a six-hour drug effect.
They're gonna have to get up
and take a pee at some point.
They'll get to see the wavy walls.
You know, not everyone has
those perceptual effects,
but they'll have that opportunity.
By blocking out the external distractions,
the idea is one can focus the
experience more internally
about the nature of yourself,
about these patterns in your life,
about the big picture of
what's going on in the world.
The idea is you might get
stuck at the pretty colors.
And the pretty colors are great,
but there might be
something even more valuable
underneath that if you dig
deeper into that experience.
And so I don't like
the word 'hallucinogen'
in that it just focuses
on that perceptual realm,
which is kind of just a trivial aspect
and not even the key therapeutic
aspect of these compounds.
Also, hallucinogen implies
that these drugs cause hallucinations,
and the strict psychiatric
definition of a hallucination,
these drugs rarely cause those.
If you have a hallucination,
it means you are observing something,
you're perceiving something
in the environment
that you actually believe is there.
Someone really thinks a pink elephant,
to use a classic example,
is really in the room.
That's a hallucination.
You thought you were talking to a friend
and having this long conversation,
and then you look over and realize,
"Oh, that friend was never there."
That's a hallucination.
What you typically get with psychedelics
are more visual illusions
or what you could call
'pseudohallucinations.'
Typically, reality testing is intact,
which is a fancy way of
saying the wall's waving
like a blanket or like waves on the beach.
That might be really impressive.
But typically, the
person knows, in reality,
the walls really aren't waving.
They realize the reason
they're seeing walls waving
is because they've taken this substance.
So you, you really don't get,
typically, true hallucinations,
so it's not a great word.
Entheogen, I've never
been a fan of that word
to refer to a drug class.
I'm a fan of using that word
in its anthropological sense.
In other words, so what 'entheogen' means,
one of the common definitions
from its linguistic roots
is "awakening the divine within,"
or "awakening God within."
So it's really referring
to this sacramental,
spiritual religious use
of these compounds.
My beef with that
is that you name the
psychoactive substance,
it's been used as an entheogen.
You know, tobacco, coca leaves,
which contain cocaine, opioids.
I mean, you'd be harder pressed
to find the drug that hasn't been used
as part of a sacrament at some point.
So I like to refer to the entheogenic use
of a particular substance.
It could be the entheogenic use of tobacco
by indigenous tribes.
It could be the entheogenic
use of ayahuasca.
But I don't wanna define
that particular substance as entheogenic.
And then as a counterpoint,
a couple of, yeah, high school kids
that take some mushrooms,
and they do a lot of giggling,
and they see some pretty
colors that really amaze them,
and they don't really have anything
that they would describe
as a spiritual effect,
that doesn't sound like
an entheogen to me.
So it's kind of an arbitrary-
you're assigning just one portion
of what these drugs can do,
but you're defining the entire drug class
with that one effect.
So that's why I think the
psychedelic is a broad enough term
to encompass all of those experiences:
the perceptual effects, the
potential spiritual effects,
and any other personal insights etc.
- The first wave: Hofmann,
Leary, and the CIA.
- The first big wave of
that scientific interest
for psychedelics was in the 1950s.
So this was, yeah, about a
decade after Albert Hofmann
had first discovered the
psychoactive properties of LSD.
And in that following decade,
essentially the pharmaceutical
company, Sandoz,
that he worked for in Switzerland,
pretty liberally sent out samples of LSD
for physicians to do research with.
And when I say research there,
it's not like research now
where you need a year's worth of approvals
with this highly restricted
access and everything.
It was like "Hey, I'm a doctor,
and I'm curious to give
this to some of my patients
to see what's up."
"Sure, here you go."
You know, put it in the
post from Switzerland.
And so, there was a lot
of sort of casual research use,
but there were also some
early clinical trials.
I would say one of the
most important groups
in the history of this work
was this group led by Abram Hoffer
and Humphry Osmond in
Saskatchewan, Canada.
And they were really the first group
that I would say developed
what we now call 'psychedelic therapy,'
this idea of that you're not
just mimicking psychosis,
which is what originally was thought
by the very early researchers.
All this stuff did
was mimic people having a psychotic break,
having a schizophrenic episode.
These Saskatchewan researchers figured out
if you prepare people and
have a comfortable environment
and just have them introspect,
lay on a couch and pay
attention to their experience,
you had these experiences
that oftentimes were
anything but psychotic.
I mean, they were reported
to be some of the most meaningful, clear,
lucid experiences of people's lives.
And you could use many names,
a transcendental experience,
mystical experience,
insightful experience.
And so there was some development,
there was other groups.
There was a group in Maryland
called the Spring Grove group.
A lot of early research there,
particularly with cancer patients.
But then the research
was really put on hold
for several decades after this period.
In the first wave of research
from the 1950s through early '70s,
there was this growing
appreciation of some of the risks
and the safeguards needed
to minimize those risks.
But not every investigator
was aware of this.
And some of them were only
aware of this as time went on,
so it was an evolution.
But some of the research just,
hey, they gave a giant
dose of LSD to someone
and then locked them in a padded room.
So one of the trials looking
to see if LSD could help
people with alcoholism,
they literally tied
people down in restraints
to their hospital bed,
gave them a massive dose of LSD,
800 micrograms, which
is a really big dose.
And they didn't give them any warning
that, like, they took this substance
that would profoundly alter
their conscious experience.
So we've figured out a lot since then,
that sort of research.
Those are the conditions under which,
when you do get experiences
that look more like psychosis,
you treat the person like
they're gonna go crazy.
And a lot of times they,
at least temporarily,
they feel like they're going crazy.
And then there was controversies
surrounding Timothy Leary at Harvard.
He did some really
great research early on.
And even while he was at Harvard,
having people over at his
house on a Saturday night,
and everyone taking it,
including the researchers.
So we've moved away from that, thankfully.
And gosh, I should mention
in that earlier era,
this is also when the CIA
was seriously investigating these drugs
as part of their MKUltra program.
This is not urban legend.
There's lots of declassified material
through the Freedom of Information Act
that has revealed this history.
They were giving it, at times,
to just American citizens without
their knowledge or consent
behind a mirror.
People visiting a sex worker, for example.
Glass of water they're
given and big dose of LSD,
and these goons from the CIA
are standing behind this one-way mirror,
like, just observing to
see what would happen.
So you had, obviously, highly
unethical research like
that going on.
Yeah, on a lot of these dimensions,
I mean, I think it's pretty clear today
what the major risks
of these compounds are.
And hopefully, just ethics have improved
the recognition of it.
This is very serious,
and don't underestimate the
damage you can do to someone,
like slipping out LSD into their drink.
- Are psychedelics legal?
- Most psychedelics aren't legal
in most countries in the world.
There are some exceptions,
but the primary classic
psychedelics we know of,
psilocybin mushrooms, or
so-called magic mushrooms,
or LSD, ayahuasca, which
contains the compound DMT,
mescaline in peyote and other cacti.
In most countries, these
are not just illegal,
but in the most restrictive class.
So for example, in the United States,
they're in Schedule 1,
or in the United Kingdom, they're
in schedule A, same thing;
it's the most restrictive class
for the most dangerous compounds
with the greatest abuse potential,
and with no recognized medical use.
Now, there are some nuances to that.
There have been some states in the U.S.
that have decriminalized,
or even in Oregon, recently,
have legalized the use of psilocybin
in the context of a therapeutic-like
situation with a guide.
But for the most part, these are illegal.
Now, the research that's happening now,
a lot of it is exploring
medical applications
through the FDA process
where there's FDA
approval and DEA approval.
So the hope is as these trials advance,
and as we move into what's
called 'phase 3 research,'
that's the final level
of a clinical trial,
typically with a larger
number of participants.
That's the final phase that can decide
whether or not this drug
is gonna be approved
as a medication by the FDA.
And so we're likely only
two, three, four years away
from multiple psychedelics potentially-
depending on those phase 3 results-
being approved for treatment.
So if that happens,
then they would be legal
to be used medically,
but they would still be
illegal in another context.
Similar to what a lot of
people may not realize
that cocaine is legal to use
in certain medical settings.
Methamphetamine is legal to use
in certain medical settings.
All kinds of opioids, as most of us know,
are legal to use in many medical settings.
So it would be moving these compounds
into more of that category:
legal for medical use.
The compounds that are
likely to be approved,
depending on the final results,
in the next few years
for medical use are MDMA,
which some people might know as Molly
or ecstasy on the street,
and psilocybin, which is in
so-called magic mushrooms.
- What are the main
effects of psychedelics?
- Yeah, so psychedelics can prompt
a wide variety of subjective changes.
And so that can span thoughts:
the way you think, your cognition.
Feelings: very profoundly at times,
the intensity of your
feelings, the variability.
You can swing from a terrifying experience
to this beautific,
sort of like most amazing
experience of your life.
So the variability,
the intensity is there.
So really any aspect of
subjective experience,
including self-identification,
how one holds-
how they define themselves,
how they define reality.
These are sort of the
deepest aspects that I think
and the aspects that are most aligned
with the psychedelics'
therapeutic effects.
One aspect that we typically talk about
with drugs, in general,
that's relatively low
for the psychedelics,
are just their effect on physiology.
Compared to the intensity
of the subjective effects,
it's remarkable how little
impact these substances have
on our biological functioning.
So your heart rate, your blood pressure.
How do people overdose
on other drug classes?
They drink so much, they
take so many opioids,
they stop breathing.
Some drug kills their liver
'cause they've taken too much of it.
They had too much of a stimulant,
and they have a stroke or heart attack.
Psychedelics are really robustly safe
at the physiological level.
There are exceptions.
For example, people at very
high risk for heart disease.
It does raise the blood
pressure and pulse somewhat,
but all of those physiological effects
really pale in comparison-
compared to other drug
classes-pale in comparison
to the intensity of
the subjective effects.
So it really is those
levels of subjective effects
that are relate to one's conception
about the big picture of their life,
how they define themselves,
how do they define reality,
which is why I think something
like the mystical experience,
which includes this sense of oneness,
being at one with the
rest of the Universe,
or being at one with the rest of humanity,
someone comes out of that,
and that has the potential
to reframe whatever disorder
we're talking about,
reframing this addiction that
they've convinced themselves,
"Oh, I'm just a failure,
I can never do it."
Having an experience like
that can really reframe that
as, frankly, as small potatoes,
and thinking about yourself
in terms of depression,
and this sort of self-fulfilling prophecy.
So it really are those,
how one defines themselves, I think,
it's at the deepest levels.
- How do psychedelics work in the brain?
- Yeah, the huge question
that's always thrown out is:
How do these psychedelics work?
And you can just come at that
from so many different angles.
Kind of the biggest divide is
whether we're talking about
on the psychological side
or the biological side.
Does it work by hitting
these brain receptors
and then having other effects,
or does it work because of the experience?
And the first thing I
like to say about that
is these are two sides of the same coin.
Presumably, every psychological experience
has a biological correlate,
whether we're aware of that now.
Like, you see the color green,
there's something happening in your brain
that's coding that experience
of the color green.
So we need to move away from
thinking it's one or the other.
And psychedelics are really interesting
'cause I think they're just, like,
they're placed right at
that interesting interface.
Clearly, there's this very
real biological effect.
Something dramatic happens to the brain
when you put the
psychedelic in the system,
but then someone has this experience.
And when they change their
life because of that,
that ends up sounding more like they went
through a really good
course of psychotherapy,
or they had a
life-transforming experience,
the way someone might say,
"Well, having children changed them,
or getting married changed them,
or falling in love for the first time
or visiting another culture
for the first time."
Sort of like these life
experiences that change people.
So psychedelics are really interesting
at that bridge, philosophically,
between the biological
and the psychological.
Now, to go down that biological
path, what's happening,
there's a lot going on, and we know a lot,
but there's a whole
lot more to figure out.
The first thing that
happens is that psilocybin,
once it's circulating through your blood
after you've eaten some of it,
well, it actually converts
to a related compound called psilocin,
which is the thing
that's actually hitting
the brain receptors,
and it activates a subtype
of serotonin receptor.
So we have lots of different
types of serotonin receptors
in our brain.
One is called the serotonin 2A receptor.
And psilocybin and the other
classic psychedelics can latch
onto that the same way
that serotonin latches
onto these brain receptors.
But they do something different,
'cause clearly serotonin itself,
which we all have floating
in our brains right now,
is not psychedelic.
But when this activates the receptor,
something different
happens within that neuron,
and it propagates this effect downstream.
And we now know that, then,
other neurotransmitter
systems are involved.
For example, we know the
glutamate system is involved.
So psilocybin effects serotonin,
but then serotonin affects
the glutamate system.
And so you can think about it
as if the serotonin 2A
is the first domino.
I think one of those set-ups
with the million dominoes in the room
where one knocks down the other,
and then it goes up a ladder,
and it spins a little
thing and falls down,
and all of that.
The serotonin 2A is just the
beginning part of the story.
It's that first domino you knock over,
and then you have the glutamate system.
And then at another level,
maybe this is sort of panning back
and viewing that whole
room full of dominoes,
but at another level of analysis
beyond what receptors are affected,
and even, like, beyond what brain areas
are become more active or less active,
a really interesting level of analysis is:
What's the nature of the communication
across the brain that's changed?
This is referred to as 'resting state.'
What are the brain network dynamics?
What's the relationship
between the activity across
different areas of the brain?
And what's interesting
is when the psychedelic
is on, in the system,
you see a massive
increase in communication
across brain areas that
don't normally communicate.
And you could tell this
by the activity in those different areas
is all of a sudden much more
correlated with each other.
And so they're normally
moving and grooving
and doing their own things.
Much of our psyche
and our mental processes
are compartmentalized.
You know, "You do your own thing,
and you do your own thing,"
and we only sort of integrate
it when it's necessary.
But it seems like you kind of, like,
have this massive
increase in communication
across these different silos in the brain.
That is probably an
important level of analysis
that is underlying, at
the psychological level,
claims of insight,
claims of extraordinary experiences,
viewing themselves from a
radically different perspective,
from a different lens.
It's sort of this, like, massive shake-up
in one's experience of reality.
And so, here we've gone
through the receptor level
to the brain activation level
to the network communication
levels of the brain,
to what's the psychological experience
that unfolds from that.
And then, presumably,
the way we get long-term behavior change
is that that person starts
to change their life.
They actually learn lessons.
And there also seems like there may be,
based on animal research,
increased plasticity,
neuroplasticity in the system
so that in the days following
the psychedelic experience,
people are more primed
to learn new things.
You know, there's a
greater sticking power,
there's a greater ability
to establish a new
and hopefully a more optimal normal state.
And then if that is sort of
reinforced and maintained,
then that just becomes the new habit.
And that's why we are seeing
people six months later
that are feeling better,
whether they're smoking less,
or they're less depressed.
So a major difference
between the classic psychedelics and MDMA
is in how they're interacting
with the serotonin system.
They're both interacting
with the serotonin system,
but in very different ways.
I mean, we should keep in mind
that typical antidepressants also interact
with the serotonin system,
but in a very different way.
So the classic psychedelics,
they're mimicking the effects
of serotonin on that receptor site.
So the way neurotransmission works,
brain communication works,
is you have one neuron here,
one brain cell and neuron
here, and one here.
And in order to have a signal
propagate, a communication,
a messenger is sent across this little gap
in-between those two neurons,
and those what we call neurotransmitters.
A little serotonin is
released into this space,
and it travels over and it activates,
it sits in this little
pocket on this side.
This is like, you know, baseball,
the receptor is the the catcher's mitt.
In the case of the classic psychedelics,
it's normally a regular baseball
that is thrown into that catcher's mitt,
Now we imagine we've swapped out,
we've taken the pitcher,
and we've taken the
regular white baseball,
and now we've put like this
tie-dye baseball in there-
this is like the psilocybin baseball.
Now that's being thrown
out into that space
in between the two cells.
And that's being captured
in that catcher's glove.
And that has a different reaction on the,
I guess, the catcher in this analogy,
than serotonin itself would.
MDMA is very different.
MDMA is working with natural serotonin.
It's causing not this differential effect
on the catcher's side,
but it's causing the pitcher,
the neuron that's normally
sending out serotonin
into that space between the two neurons,
it's causing the pitcher
to just throw out a
massive increase in balls.
So now, the catcher is on the mound,
and they're just getting balls
thrown at them left and right
'cause this pitcher's just going crazy,
throwing out way more serotonin,
or more normal baseballs
than normally would.
And so that has a different
effect on the system
than the classic psychedelics.
So there's a fundamentally different way
in which the biology works,
and most experienced users
will tell you it feels
fundamentally different.
And there's more commonalities
between the classic psychedelics,
let's say LSD and magic
mushrooms or psilocybin,
shades of difference,
but in the grand scheme of things,
those are very similar compared
to, on the other hand, MDMA.
And we have some edge cases,
some more exotic compounds, 5-methoxy-DMT.
We're still early in the research.
It might be that serotonin
2A plays less of a role
in the primary effects of 5-methoxy-DMT,
but that's not definitively shown yet.
A lot of these compounds,
well we have a simplistic story
about serotonin 2A being
the primary receptor,
but, in fact, most of them hit
a large number of receptors
to a different degree,
so it can be a complex process.
There's substantial evidence
that 2A is the key receptor
that mediates the effects
of classic psychedelics.
How do we know that?
We know that there are these
compounds called 'antagonists'
that people can take,
and that will block a specific receptor.
And so there are
compounds, like ketanserin,
that will block the serotonin
2A and not other receptors.
It does a little bit,
but it's primary blocking
action is on the serotonin 2A.
And if you block serotonin
2A, all of a sudden,
you can give a big old dose
of psilocybin to people,
and they don't feel anything.
And the same thing happens in rats.
You can train rats to say,
"When I've given you an
injection of psilocybin
in the belly,
10 minutes before your session,
we put you in a sort of a skinner box
where you can press levers-
give you psilocybin on those days,
the left lever is the one
that gives you a little
food pellet if you press it.
And on other days
where you just give
you a saline injection,
a placebo, essentially, in the belly,
on those days, the right
lever is what gives you,
is produces the food pellet."
And then if we do that for a few weeks,
all of a sudden, that animal
is able to reliably tell us
whether they've gotten psilocybin or not,
which is really remarkable.
And then you could do interesting things,
like give another compound,
like LSD, and all of a sudden,
they'll treat it as if it was psilocybin.
So it's a powerful
pharmacological assay in animals.
And so if we block the
serotonin 2A receptor
in those rats,
they are no longer able to distinguish,
to discriminate between a psychedelic
and a saline injection-
very consistent with the human work.
And there's other layers.
You can create rodents
that are so-called
'knockouts,' where, from birth,
they're lacking the serotonin 2A receptor.
And in those genetically
modified knockouts,
psychedelics don't work.
So there's all kinds,
and there's also a very,
very tight correlation
amongst the existing classic psychedelics.
If you plot how many
milligrams you need to give,
so this is the potency,
whether you need to give 400 milligrams
or just a 10th of a
milligram in the case of LSD,
and you correlate that with the affinity
for this serotonin 2A receptor,
which is like the stickiness
for that receptor,
how is it likely that that compound,
that drug is gonna stick
into that receptor?
That's an astonishingly tight correlation.
So there really is substantial evidence
that the serotonin 2A
is the primary site of action
for these psychedelics.
And it's probably the case
that these other receptor
sites add some coloring
to the effect,
but we know that, in different ways,
if you take out 2A,
you don't have any
substantial experience there.
So only what are we call the
classic psychedelics hit 2A.
So the primary examples being LSD,
psilocybin, mescaline, DMT.
Drugs like ketamine
and PCP affect the
glutamate system primarily
as their first sort of site of action.
And then you have other compounds:
MDMA releases serotonin,
so that's a different form of action
on the serotonin system.
You have compounds like salvinorin A,
which I did the first human trials
that were blinded that actually
found an effect of that
as the primary agent in salvia divinorum.
That activates a type of opioid receptor
called the kappa opioid
receptor, which is different.
Most of the opioids we
think of are mu opioids:
morphine, heroin, oxycodone,
very addictive compounds.
The kappa opioid system is very different
and leads to a very different variety
of psychedelic effects.
So that has its own distinct pathway.
Ibogaine, that's an interesting one.
That affects a lot of
these various mechanisms
that are at play with
different psychedelics.
So it's almost like a jack
of all trades psychedelic
with different points of entry.
It's pharmacologically pretty promiscuous.
Ibogaine is of interest
because of the anecdotes
of people overcoming
opioid addiction with it.
And there does seem to be some
really compelling evidence,
even in animals, in rats.
Ibogaine will substantially
decrease their
self-administration of drugs,
like opioids and cocaine.
It seems to normalize
the wild fluctuations
that happen within addiction
and our so-called reward system,
our mesolimbic system,
the rewards pathway.
And that becomes
dysregulated in addiction.
Even in an animal like a rat,
you'll see these wild
fluctuations of dopamine.
And with ibogaine,
you'll see this kind of more normalizing,
kind of tamping down
those wild fluctuations
into more of the normal range.
However, there are concerns with ibogaine
that it can hurt someone
with heart disease,
and that's more of a concern
than with the classic psychedelics.
There's concerns about prolonging
the so-called QT interval
in the heart.
So there's debate
about whether there's a
clinical future for ibogaine.
Some people argue that its
top potential toxic effects
are such that it's not
gonna be ever approved
as an FDA treatment.
There's others that disagree.
I'm actually most interested
in using something like psilocybin
and LSD to treat opioid addiction
because compared to ibogaine,
these are remarkably low
in physical toxicity.
And I think some of these mechanisms may,
in fact, be shared.
It may be that some of those properties
that we think that are unique
to ibogaine aren't so unique
and maybe that we're
seeing them with psilocybin
and the other classic
psychedelics as well-
but we'll need more
research to figure that out.
- Are psychedelics dangerous?
What is the link to schizophrenia?
- So some critique over
the use of psychedelics
as medical treatments
is that they're particularly dangerous.
Now, I want to be clear,
every medical intervention
and every psychoactive compound has risks.
So caffeine has very real risks to it.
A wide variety of
compounds will have risks.
The key question is: What are those risks,
and what can we do to
minimize those risks?
In the big picture, the harms
you see from psychedelics,
even though they're real,
and we know what they are,
the prevalence of these
dangers pale in comparison
to other psychoactive substances,
both illegal and legal substances.
So numerous scientific investigations
have had experts rank order
the harms to the user
and the harms to society in
general, to other people,
across a wide variety of
compounds, legal and illegal.
What's happened time and time again
when people bring objective
data to these questions,
as you see at the top of the list,
some of the compounds that,
it really bears little relationship
at all to legal status.
So at the top of that list,
you'll get compounds
like tobacco and alcohol.
Consistently at the far
other end of that continuum
are psilocybin mushrooms,
ranked as the lowest
amongst all the major
psychoactive compounds
in terms of harm to
self and harm to others.
And LSD is in a very similar position.
So that's not to say that
there aren't dangers.
There are very real dangers,
but we know what they are.
And in the grand scheme of things,
they're just far less
prevalent than the harms we see
from some of these other
compounds out there.
And one of the amazing things
about the classic psychedelics,
like psilocybin and LSD,
is that they're not addictive.
They can be abused,
meaning they can be used in a
dangerous way to the person.
A couple of teenagers takes mushrooms,
and they go driving on it, that's abuse.
They're using it in a way
that can hurt themselves
and other people,
but they're not addictive.
No one's jonesing for
their next shroom fix.
And the other category
is their physical safety.
Relative to other psychoactive substances,
they're really freakishly physically safe.
For most people, there's no
known lethal overdose amount
for psilocybin or for LSD.
Now, you could do something
stupid when you're on it
and get yourself killed,
wander into traffic.
But in terms of just killing your liver,
giving you a stroke,
making you stop breathing,
these are the ways that you
take too much of a drug,
and they do you in,
none of that stuff happens,
doesn't cause organ damage or death.
So we know a lot about
these risks of psychedelics,
and one of the major factors that we know
that separates riskier
use from less risky use
is the presence of a sober guide.
Or if you're outside
of a clinical context,
simply having a friend there,
another human being you trust,
not a bunch of strangers,
but a person or people that one trusts
with them during the experience.
Ideally not on the substance too,
because they may not be able to respond
to your psychological crisis
when they're dealing with their own.
And also be in a situation
where one can really let go.
So you're not able to fully
let go when you're at a concert
or hanging out in public,
wandering the sidewalks of a city street.
You should be worried
about someone's gonna steal
your purse or your wallet.
I mean, you can't trust
everyone out there.
And sexual assault is real,
and being on highly intoxicated
substances in public,
that's a major concern.
So the less risky use
is gonna be with someone that they trust,
and it's gonna be with a substance
that they know something about its purity
and the dose that they're taking,
they're not just not just winging it.
And it's gonna be in a safe environment
where they're not worried
about making sure no one assaults them
or steals their wallet,
and they're able to really
let go into this experience.
And I don't encourage people
to do psychedelics on their own.
I don't encourage any drug
use, including caffeine use,
but I have no problem telling people,
and I like to tell people,
what we know can separate
riskier use from less risky use.
And the more it looks like
the clinical research where we're doing,
where there is control over the dose
and the person is not alone,
they're with someone they trust,
they know what they're taking,
the less likely that they're
going to run into pitfalls.
There were a lot of overstatements
and urban legends in the 1960s
about the dangers of these compounds,
things like that it was
common for teenagers
to stare into the sun
and burn their eyes blind
because they were on LSD.
There's no credible
evidence that ever happened.
There's concerns about
frying your chromosomes,
that it causes genetic damage.
There was a lot of concern over that,
especially because this
was not too many years
after the thalidomide tragedies,
where young people were being
born with deformed limbs,
and this type of thing.
So there's really heightened
concern over genetic damage.
And it was found that LSD
could scramble chromosomes
in a Petri dish, but no evidence-
and apparently a lot of substances,
a lot of things will scramble
chromosomes in a Petri dish-
no evidence whatsoever
in real living organisms
that that's a concern.
Certainly the bad trip
is a real phenomenon.
It's relatively rare, but
sometimes people have accidents,
and sometimes people die when
they're having a bad trip,
and they panic, and
they fall from a height,
or they wander into traffic or
wander in a neighbor's house,
and they get shot by the police.
These things have happened.
However, you'll run across some old,
you can see some amazing YouTube clips
of folks saying if someone has a bad trip,
there's only one solution,
and that's to commit suicide.
And so someone who's having a bad trip
is gonna seek out, in any
possible way, to end their life,
just a massive overstatement.
Most bad trips, as horrific as they are,
if the person is in a safe environment,
the drug will wear off,
and they'll be fine.
I'm not encouraging it,
but there a lot of overstatements.
And there is the concern
about exacerbating mental illness
in the form of psychotic
disorders like schizophrenia.
The evidence really suggests
that it's people who have an
identifiable predisposition,
there's some early signs
that they're the type of
person who can get this.
And a big piece of evidence for that
is the fact that out of
the thousands of people
that have been treated
by psilocybin and LSD
in the older era and modern
era of medical research,
there hasn't been a single case
of someone who's gone
through the screening
in a clinical context
where schizophrenia has been instigated.
But there are a number of
cases, just observationally,
where it looks like someone
showed those early signs,
and they did a bunch of LSD,
and they went over the edge.
I think of Syd Barrett,
as a Pink Floyd fan,
the first lead singer of Pink Floyd,
looked like he was showing those signs.
A highly creative person,
it kind of fits a
pattern of a lot of folks
with that trajectory and that tendency.
It was probably the LSD
and a very vulnerable person
that really pushed him over the edge
for a full-blown psychotic disorder.
Unfortunately, people
aren't the best judge
about whether they are predisposed,
especially young people,
especially since first psychotic
breaks happen in people
in either their teenage
years or their early 20s
around the same time
when people are first
experimenting with drugs.
So that is an area of concern.
You don't necessarily know
whether you're the type of person
who might have those tendencies,
that genetic predisposition or not.
But it's certainly a
minority of the population.
- What are the biggest
risks of psychedelics?
- Yeah, the biggest risks
of psychedelics are,
for a small percentage of people
that have active psychosis
like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder,
those people can be destabilized.
It's been misstated that
people have gone on trips,
and they never come back.
I mean, that's an overstatement
in the sense that the drug is metabolized,
and it gets out of their system.
But the way I view it,
it's the same way
that a destabilizing life
event can harm these people
and worsen their circumstances,
their disease state.
Becoming homeless, for example,
from someone who has that predisposition,
can massively destabilize that person.
Being attacked or having
some other traumatic event
can destabilize that person.
Having a big psychedelic experience
can destabilize that person.
So the way we address that
risk is by screening people,
and we can reliably identify people
with structured psychiatric
interviews to conclude,
"Yep, you're not at a high
risk for these disorders.
It seems very clear."
The other big risk is that
anyone can have a bad trip,
and that's referring
to anxiety, fear, panic
that could potentially
lead to dangerous behavior.
And the way that we
address those in the clinic
is to prepare people that
it can be very scary.
And we're going to describe
all kinds of those experiences.
More importantly, is
developing that rapport
and trust between the guides,
the people who would be with
them during the experience
and the participant,
so that when they're in the session,
if they're having some level of anxiety,
they can let the guide know,
and the guide can reassure them,
say like, "I'm here with
you, I'm not leaving.
You're perfectly safe.
It's perfectly normal to feel this fear,
and keep going through it."
- How do all-arounders get to the core
of psychiatric disorders?
- So I study all kinds of
classes of psychedelic drugs:
cocaine, alcohol, methamphetamine,
tobacco, nicotine.
So I refer to the uppers, the downers,
and the all-arounders.
And the reason I refer to the psychedelics
as the all-arounders,
well, first I have to
appropriately cite it,
as a scientist, my source.
I'm taking that from Cheech & Chong,
some of my favorite comedians.
But so the all-arounders,
the reason psychedelics are all-arounders
is because you can't reliably
explain their effects
in a very simple way to a person.
If someone's never taken cocaine before,
you can do a decent job
of describing the effects.
Have you had a bunch of coffee?
You know what it's like to be hopped up
on too much caffeine?
Not identical, but imagine that,
but you're just very happy.
Imagine you're getting some
of the best news of your life
and being wired on a bunch of coffee.
Not perfect, but people can get the flavor
of what you're talking about.
The downers, whether you're talking
about the benzodiazepines,
like Valium and Xanax,
or you're talking about the
opioids, the pain relievers,
you know what it's like to
be really, really sleepy
and feel like really, really
cozy, and this type of thing.
They're more within the normal
range of human experience,
and they're more reliable.
Very few people take cocaine
and fall asleep afterwards.
As an example, that's why
they're called uppers.
The psychedelics, all bets are off.
I think kind of the only bet you can make
is that if you have the dose high enough,
something really
interesting is gonna happen.
But what that is, you don't know.
You might find yourself
in your mind's eye,
soaring in the heavens,
the secrets of the Universe
seemingly revealed to you,
this bliss and this love for humanity.
I mean, right?
These descriptions can be
amongst the most extreme experiences,
positive experiences that you can imagine.
On the other hand,
five seconds later,
it might collapse into what
folks call a 'bad trip,'
or I call, in this research,
a 'challenging experience,'
where one could feel
that they're gonna die.
They could feel like they've
gone permanently crazy,
and they're never gonna come back.
I mean, so just on the positive side,
on the difficult side,
it's impossible to overstate
how extreme these experiences
can be for people,
and how unpredictable
these experiences can be;
which is why when you administer them,
it seems like the best thing to do
is to encourage the person
to be aware of this wide
range of experiences,
but don't try to control it.
Whatever the experience is,
take the orientation of: "This
is what I need to deal with."
If, in my mind's eye,
it seems like I'm being
devoured by a monster,
don't run away from it.
Look the monster in the eye and say,
"What are you doing in my head?
Let's figure something
out here," you know?
So don't flee the-
accept it, take a mindfulness approach,
and just observe your own
experience, whatever that is,
without trying to alter it and say,
"Oh, no, I wanted this type of experience.
I didn't want that type of experience."
Good luck with that.
That's just gonna snowball the experience
towards something even more difficult.
Going into this type of
treatment is not easy at all.
And, in fact, when people come
in for their session days,
and so this is after weeks of preparation,
many hours of preparation,
if I'm meeting with them
that morning, and they say,
"Oh, I'm feeling great, bring it on,
like, no worries whatsoever,"
that gives me some pause.
If if you're not worried at all,
then we haven't done our job correctly
because this is a big deal.
You should at least have some butterflies
because that's the gravity of
what you're about to go into.
- What is the role of a guide
in a psychedelic session?
- I started my research with
psychedelics over 18 years ago,
right after I obtained my Ph.D.,
and I've done a lot of studies,
many lab studies addressing
different questions.
I've supervised these studies,
designed them, analyzed them,
but really one of the
most rewarding aspects
has been serving as one of the people
that guides these sessions.
In other words, being
the person in the room
with the individual
who's taken a high dose of a psychedelic.
And I've guided over 100 sessions
with various psychedelics,
and that's been exceptionally rewarding.
So there's a lot of names for this role:
You could use the word guide,
therapist, facilitator.
You might liken it to
the role of a shaman.
I like the word "guide."
It's not really perfect.
In some sense in these sessions,
one is instructed to
trust, let go, be open.
And the guide, if they've
established that rapport,
their really- job at that
point is as a safety net.
So, it's not like the guide
is providing specific instructions,
like you're guiding folks
along a path through the mountains.
Like, "Oh, be sure to make a left up here
when you get to that turn."
It's not like that,
so in some sense it can be misleading.
But in terms of a general orientation,
which is mostly done
before the session itself,
instructing the person
to take this orientation of surrender,
no matter what the particular
challenge may look like
on the surface,
the solution always has a common theme
of just not fighting
it, surrendering to it,
treating it as a learning experience.
There's other names like "shaman."
I mean, I think we have to be careful
to learn as much as we can
from indigenous cultures that
have used these compounds,
but we're not replicating
exactly what they're doing.
That would not be appropriate.
So I think, in a lot of ways,
the shaman term is not appropriate
for the mainstream clinical,
medical use of these compounds.
Especially as we're moving
towards the medical
development of psychedelics
as potentially approved medicines,
we can really think of that
role as that of a therapist.
And as these compounds move
into more mainstream treatment,
it probably will be a variety
of forms of therapists,
counselors, psychologist, psychiatrists,
social workers who are
playing those roles.
Even when you're in a study
where there's not a therapeutic intent,
let's just say it's a study
where you're examining the
effects of a psychedelic
on a certain aspect of
behavior on their brain,
what have you,
in order to administer
a psychedelic safely,
I'd argue you really have
to establish the same sort
of therapeutic rapport,
that tight relationship,
that trusting relationship
that any therapist should
have with their client.
Because particularly so
in a psychedelic session,
people can be left in extremely
vulnerable situations.
People can literally
feel that they are dying,
and that it's one of the most
vulnerable, sensitive states
that they could be put in.
So it's really just critical
to minimize paranoia
and to maximize the safety
in order to have that kind of strong trust
and rapport with their guide.
- What is the focus and
impact of your research?
- I focused on a lot of topics
within the psychedelic area,
trying to understand the nature
of these experiences just
to characterize them.
Part of that work has been this focus
on what's called the
'mystical experience,'
which sounds a little woo-woo,
but it's actually describing
a really validated
psychological construct.
It's really divorced from
any supernatural beliefs
that someone may have or not.
What it describes is
this type of experience
where someone feels that they
are one with the Universe,
one with the rest of humanity,
some sort of sense of unity.
It also involves feeling
that one has stepped out
of the domains of time and space,
so it's a timeless and
spaceless type of experience.
And there's a sense of ineffability,
in other words, that no matter
how hard the person tries,
this is ultimately beyond words.
Those descriptors surround
the mystical experience,
which, even outside of psychedelics,
was an area of interest.
Going back 100 years ago,
William James, the founder
of American Psychology,
was fascinated by these
experiences across the globe
and the commonalities among them.
So that's been a major focus,
and as I've moved into
more therapeutic studies,
in other words, seeing if
psilocybin sessions can help
to treat any number of disorders,
one of the findings
that's really shaken out
is that the more mystical
the actual session was,
in other words, the more likely
the person is to endorse,
"Yes, I felt one with the
Universe," this type of thing,
the more likely the person
is gonna be less depressed
and less anxious,
if they're a cancer patient
who's been dealing with
depression and anxiety,
the more likely the person
trying to quit smoking
is gonna successfully quit
smoking six months down the road.
So there's seem to really
be something important
about the nature of the experience
that people have during these sessions.
So it's not just about
hitting a certain type
of serotonin receptor in the brain.
There's something about the
psychology of the experience
that unfolds during that session
that tends to be important,
which is, in some sense,
what makes the psilocybin treatments
a bit more like psychotherapy
than traditional psychiatric medications
where you just take the
pill, and just you forget it.
It does its magic in your brain,
and you don't have to worry
about what you do with
that biological effect.
And so, in terms of the
therapeutic studies,
there's been a number
of areas of focus treating cancer patients
who have substantial
depression and anxiety
because of a very
serious cancer diagnosis.
This is following up from work
that happened in the 1960s
with LSD trying to help
terminal cancer patients.
And that work has resulted
in some really impressive
findings with dramatic reductions
from only a single high-dose
psilocybin session.
You see large reductions, on average,
into the normal range of
depression and anxiety scale.
So really bringing people
into that level of depression
and anxiety that where
people wouldn't be diagnosed
with a disorder anymore,
so substantial reductions.
Another major area of focus
for me has been addiction.
And where I started out
was in helping people
quit tobacco smoking.
And so that area has also seen
some really dramatic results.
We conducted a small
open-label pilot study,
just to test the waters
initially, with 15 people,
but we found some dramatic results.
Six months later,
80% of these people were
biologically verified
as smoke-free,
which really swamps
any current treatments.
Now, that was very early,
and the real question was:
Is that worthy od follow-up
with more rigorous research?
And I'm in the midst of that research now,
and that's been such a
successful line of research
that the United States federal
government recently awarded
a federal grant for us
to expand that research
into a multi-site study.
And this is the first time
where the U.S. government
has explicitly devoted funding
for administering a classic
psychedelic compound,
like psilocybin, for
a therapeutic purpose,
the first time in about a half
century since the late '60s,
so we're really excited about that.
And I've also conducted
other studies looking
at the effects of psilocybin
on a meditation practice,
so people who are starting
a meditation practice.
Does a psilocybin experience help
to jumpstart that practice?
Does it help the person
to get more value out of
their meditation experience?
And we found results consistent with that,
that particularly with
more pro-social benefits,
improvements in people's
lives, helping others,
these sort of altruistic traits,
that having the psilocybin experiences
on top of the meditation practice,
you seem to get more bang for your buck.
- What really amazes you in your research?
- I'm floored when people
with really substantial life experience
will say things like,
"This was the most meaningful experience
of their life,
or the most intense
experience of their life."
I've had combat veterans say
that their high-dose psilocybin
session replaced combat
as being the most intense
experience of their life.
I mean, so it's those
types of situations where,
I've never been in combat,
so you pay attention when
people say things like that.
And in fact, I repeat
that to new participants.
Like, "Many people say
this is beyond words,
but in the spirit of informed consent,
I'm gonna try my best
to describe the range of
what people say about this."
And people say extreme things like that.
I mean, there are folks who have engaged
in all manner of
impressive life experience,
people who have traveled the world,
who have volunteered feeding the poor
in Third World countries,
clergy members from
various religious faiths,
people who have been spiritual seekers
of one variety or another,
people who have been on a meditation path
and they've had thousands of hours
of meditation in their lifetime.
To be floored by their
experiences on psychedelics,
it's just really impressive.
I mean, in thinking about
the meditation research,
you'd kind of think that,
'Well, these are people
that have really spent years
combing the depths of their own mind,
and, ah, what are they gonna,
it might be interesting,
but what new is gonna be there for them?
And if there is something,
it's gonna be sort of
highfalutin, philosophical,
'cause they've kind of
cleaned up their own mess
in their psychological
basement,' so to speak.
But I remember the first
or second participant
in that line of research,
the person was completely focused
on all the kind of baggage
that came from being the sort
of the second-fiddle child
in the family of origin dynamic,
jealous of the older sibling
and this type of stuff.
Like, you would've thought,
"Oh, you would've handled
all this kind of, like,
low-level psychological
baggage decades ago."
But no, people, they can be profoundly hit
by these experiences.
And also I think of people with trauma
that comes up sometimes
from decades in the past.
And even when that's
not what they're there
in that study to address,
I mean, they might be in
a study to quit smoking,
and they have some unresolved trauma
from some horrific
relationship from 40 years ago.
Wow, I mean, that just seems
to come to the surface.
There does seem to be something,
and we still need to figure out
how this works scientifically
and verify that it works
this way scientifically.
But it seems, through observation,
that the material that needs
to come up psychologically
for that person is the
material that comes up.
So the way I express this
sometimes to participants,
sometimes it seems like it's
like the Rolling Stones lyric,
"You may not get what you want,
but you may get what you need,"
which is consistent with that orientation
of just whatever it is, trust, let go,
treat that as a learning
experience, and deal with it.
There are many times where
I've witnessed things
that have touched my heart.
I remember one participant in a study
that was looking at the
nature of the experiences
that unfolded with psilocybin.
And we weren't trying
to treat any disorder,
but we're all human, we
all have our baggage.
And I remember this
one gentleman who just,
his son had committed suicide
not too many years in the past,
and it really seemed like,
in the context of the psilocybin session,
he did deep, deep psychological
processing of that,
including his own feelings of guilt
for his role in the family dynamic,
things that he felt guilty about.
And you think, 'Well, it's been
some time, it's been years,'
but gosh, the floodgates really open.
And when someone's having
an experience like that,
the only thing you can do
is just try to stay present for them,
pay attention, and to be
open to what's happening,
but also realize there's
nothing you can say,
other than, "I'm here with
you, I'm not going anywhere."
If the person is sobbing with tears,
it's letting them know
that's all welcomed.
That's exactly what you
should be doing right now.
Sometimes you deal with
the people feel guilty
about being the center of attention.
And especially when they're experiencing
these high-dose effects of a psychedelic,
it might seem weird to them,
"Why am I having this experience,
and you two other people in the room,
the guides, you're not?
This is weird."
And you try to let the person know that,
"Hey, we're just playing different roles.
You're the astronaut,
we're ground control, but we're a team.
We just have different roles on this day."
And to let the person
know, "This is your day."
And this is one of the ways
where it differs very much
from a lot of recreational use where,
let's say you're at a party,
and you took too many mushrooms,
and you end up in the back
room, someone's bedroom,
just crying your eyes out
at the relationship with your mom.
And then the next day,
your friends tell you,
"Oh, man, not so many
mushrooms for you next time.
Whew, you should have
had one or two more beers
to kind of chill out a little bit."
And even if it's friendly,
it's just a subtle sort of
dismissal of that experience.
In the therapeutic context, it's like,
"Oh, you're crying about your mom.
Perfect, more of that. It's all welcome."
The laughter, the tears,
everything in between,
that's exactly what this process is for,
for you to fully absorb into
whatever those emotions are.
- Why are we in a psychedelic renaissance?
- There's some interacting reasons
why the 'psychedelic
renaissance' is happening now.
One is that, even before COVID-19 hit,
our society has been in
a mental health crisis,
and it's been stagnating.
Pharmaceutical companies
don't make the investments
in new mental healthcare treatments
like they did decades ago.
And I would say for the
treatment of depression,
really we haven't seen much
in the way of major advances,
really since 70 years ago.
Even in the '80s,
Prozac and the newer sort of
antidepressants, the SSRIs,
the serotonin selective
reuptake inhibitors,
those were essentially safer versions
of the same types of drugs
that we had going back to the 1950s
that essentially augmented the amount
of serotonin floating around
between your brain cells.
These newer antidepressants are safer.
It's harder to overdose on them
than some of the older generation drugs.
That's great when you're
treating a depressed population.
Nonetheless, the success
rates weren't really improved.
And we know that a large
portion of people treated
with traditional antidepressants
don't see benefit.
There is modest benefit,
on average, for people.
And I don't want to take that away,
and I'm all for having
more tools in the toolbox
than fewer tools in the toolbox.
But I think society's been acutely aware
of the limitations.
We've been hitting the ceiling
with mental health treatment
and I mentioned depression,
but gosh, addiction, same exact thing.
I mean, the best medical
treatments that we have
for many addictions are
substitution treatments,
also known as 'agonist treatments.'
And again, I think these are good.
I'm glad those are tools
that are out there.
But methadone for opioid addiction,
nicotine replacement, like the
patch or the gum for smoking,
I mean, these are essentially safer forms
of the essential same drug
that someone can take.
While those have many benefits,
when you don't see success,
I would say it's probably
'cause they failed to get to the roots
of these mental disorders,
including addiction-
and that's why I think psychedelics
have been so successful.
I mean, aside from the
mental health crisis
and the stagnation and the
treatment of mental health,
the other thread has been
enough time had to pass
since the late 1960s, early 1970s
where that initial, about 15-year period
of exciting psychedelic research-
it all came to a halt.
I mean, there were researchers
that were running sessions
and got the notices they just had to stop.
And the rug was just
pulled out from folks.
And while there was
some unethical research-
there was some wild research-
the majority of the research
was done by responsible folks
who were aware of risks,
and they were safeguarding
against those risks.
But psychedelics became so associated
with the counterculture in the late 1960s,
with the anti-Vietnam War protests,
with the worldwide youth movement,
the countercultural movement,
and all of those changes in society
that really scared a
lot of people in power-
and psychedelics got an
unfair portion of that blame.
I mean, I think the biggest reason
for the Vietnam War protests wasn't LSD,
it was because of the war in Vietnam.
So it was a complex
situation where the science
and medical use really
was, it was sacrificed.
But I also like to remind folks
that this is not unprecedented.
In fact, in Thomas Kuhn's
classic 1962 volume,
"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,"
he introduced the concept
of paradigm shift.
And he said the way that
paradigm shifts happen in science
is it takes the old guard,
the old guard does not adopt
the new method, the new theory-
they essentially have to die out,
enough time has to pass.
And the examples are
numerous and staggering.
So Isaac Newton published the Principia,
the laws of motion in the late 1600s.
I mean, arguably the most
important scientific publication
of all time.
That was ignored for about a half century
before other scientists
really paid attention
and started applying it.
Another biggie: Charles Darwin wrote
"The Origin of Species."
And I tell you, at the end of
the volume "Origin of Species"
where he introduced the
concept of evolution
by natural selection,
he said, and I'm paraphrasing,
"I'm not holding my breath
for the naturalists,"
which was their word for
biologists, essentially.
"I'm not holding my breath
for the naturalists of today
to accept my theory and run with it.
They're not going to.
I'm looking to the younger generation
and the generations yet,
to come who will pick up
on these ideas and move with it."
And very similarly, it took
a half century or more.
And arguably even today,
it hasn't been widespread
adoption in the culture at large.
So we're really in more
good company than we realize
when we're in this situation where,
'Hey, there was this
initial burst of excitement
about these drugs and
their potential ability
to have major effects in
improving mental healthcare
if we use them in a
judicious, proper way.'
And then it just sort of,
the rug is pulled out for decades
before there's a reinitiation.
And I like to think that society was,
in a sense, traumatized from that.
We weren't quite ready,
perhaps, for the introduction,
especially high doses of LSD
by a lot of young people.
A lot of people claim
benefit from that exposure,
and some people were harmed.
But I think now, society is more ready
to kind of accept these compounds,
and the whole picture of them.
They're not panaceas in this-
nothing is gonna be a
miracle cure for everyone.
Nonetheless, they have so much promise,
and we have to have that balance.
I think that's more possible today.
One of the nice things in science,
even if it feels like you're
being ignored by everyone-
and this is how I felt 18 years ago
with my initial interest
in psychedelic science-
if you feel like the
world is ignoring you,
at least you're getting
those papers out there
in the scientific literature.
It might be a hundred years from now,
but some graduate student somewhere,
if we haven't blown ourselves up by then,
is gonna read this paper
and say, "Huh, wow,"
just like I picked up those papers
and read about that early
research from the '50s and '60s.
So it's been great that
it hasn't taken 100 years,
and that people are
actually paying attention
to this research while I'm still alive-
that's awesome.
- What are some pitfalls
of psychedelic medicine?
- One of the pitfalls
of this clinical work
is that you'd be hard pressed
to find a more intimate
and vulnerable psychological
intervention for a person.
People are at their most vulnerable
in these psychedelic experiences,
and you can't overstate the weight
that comes with being in
one of these sessions,
having orchestrated one of
these sessions as a guide,
as a scientist.
Some people will describe
as the most important
experience of their life.
That's just a situation
that is ripe for abuses
if we don't have the
right safeguards there.
So all of the abuses that
we normally know about,
sexual abuse being right up there,
and that's why it's important
to have certain mechanisms in place.
I think it's better to
have multiple guides
that are witnessing the session,
whether they're both in
the room or one is outside,
at least watching on camera.
But we need to make sure
multiple people are involved.
We need to limit the
use of therapeutic touch
and have informed
consent surrounding that.
So holding someone's hand,
holding their shoulder,
but not doing extensive body work
as some folks would like to
call it during the session,
because that's just gonna,
for some people, that's gonna
lead to boundary issues.
And unfortunately, I think in
this area with psychedelics,
clinicians can get into,
and scientists can get into a space
that I call 'psychedelic exceptionalism,'
where the idea is that these
experiences are so big,
and this is so far
beyond what we normally
deal with in medicine,
in clinical psychology, you name it,
that new rules apply.
Tim Leary said this a lot:
"This is too big for the science game."
This is like our normal
games can't contain this.
We need to take the
opposite approach and say,
"Because of that vulnerability,
because of the incredible
gravity of these sessions,
we need to even more tenaciously cling
to those clinical boundaries,"
that ethics training that you learn
when you're becoming a physician
or a clinical psychologist or
a social worker or a nurse,
all of these professions.
We need to really a adhere to those,
what might seem like
boring old ethical codes
because they're gonna
really be tested here.
So the second pitfall would
be 'metaphysical neutrality.'
Essentially, when people butt up
against those big picture questions,
what's happening in these
sessions is an experience of God,
is an experience of ancestors,
visiting different
dimensions, you name it,
all kinds of explanations
that are provided,
we just have to really let
the patient drive the bus
in terms of making any of those claims.
We have to be metaphysically neutral.
That doesn't mean we
should correct someone.
If someone thought that
was an experience of Jesus
or the Buddha,
it's not on us to say, "No,
no, no, no, no, that wasn't.
We're being neutral here."
What it means
is we're just not making
that inference for them.
That we're just supporting
whatever their process
and their conclusions from this;
it's not our job.
And a very concrete aspect of this
is really staying away
from the imposition of religious
icons in these sessions.
Unfortunately, it's become commonplace
and typical to have a Buddhist
statue in these rooms.
I have nothing personally
against Buddhist statues.
They're very pleasant,
but I don't think it's appropriate
in mainstreaming this treatment.
I say BYOB, "bring your own Buddha"
or any other meaningful object,
be it a crucifix, be it a flying
spaghetti monster painting.
Whatever it is for you,
the pictures of yourself and your kids,
bring those meaningful objects.
And we just have to check
ourselves into playing guru,
playing priest, playing
at this metaphysical level
where we're filling in
those answers for patients.
And then the third pitfall
is being loose with
the term consciousness,
and the conclusions we're making
about what psychedelics
have scientifically told
us about consciousness.
One part of that is we
just need more precision
in our language.
Consciousness is a pretty sloppy term;
it means many things.
Kind of the most
impressive use of the term
is what we refer to as
'phenomenal consciousness.'
And this relates
to the so-called hard
problem of consciousness.
That is like: Why is there
an experience at all?
Why is not the universe just
made out of these objects?
Whether they're people, animals,
other things that are interacting.
Why is there an inside
experience to anybody?
It appears impossible
to answer that question.
That's why philosophers call it
"the hard problem of consciousness."
So, never say never.
I'm open to psychedelic
research addressing
the hard problem of consciousness.
Right now, I don't think
anyone can think of a way
in which psychedelics can do
that, but it's a worthy effort.
But we need to check ourselves.
Other things, when we use
the term consciousness,
sometimes we mean self-identity,
having a self-concept.
That relates to these experiences of unity
or so-called 'ego death.'
I think there's a lot that we can learn
with psychedelics on that
aspect of consciousness
because sometimes people
don't have a sense of self,
or at least they have a
radically altered sense of self.
So we can learn a lot more
about the brain mechanisms
underlying the sense of self.
And there's other things
called consciousness,
'access consciousness.'
This is sort of you have-
you weren't thinking about your
grandmother two seconds ago,
but now you are 'cause I
used the word grandmother.
That's come from somewhere in your brain.
There was a memory there.
It wasn't in your awareness
at the moment, but now it is.
What is that process of being called forth
of things being brought into awareness?
That's also in the category
where I think psychedelics
can be brought to bear
in answering some of these questions.
However, most of the work that's
been done with psychedelics
in terms of the brain mechanisms,
it has not addressed any
of these questions of consciousness.
Most of those, most of the
psychedelic work in the brain
has addressed how psychedelics
work in the brain.
And I think when we
automatically make that leap of,
"Well, psychedelics seem
so fundamentally
important to consciousness
that if we figure out how
psychedelics are working,
that's telling us something fundamental
about how consciousness is working,"
we're on a slippery slope there,
we can start to fool ourselves.
So we really have to have more
precision in our language,
and drill down more rigorously
on these questions of consciousness.
- Will psychedelics answer
the hard problem of consciousness?
- The hard problem of consciousness refers
to this seemingly unsolvable problem of:
How and why is anybody aware?
Why is there an experience there?
The only evidence that we have
for phenomenal consciousness,
the idea that there is
some experience being had
is that I feel that I'm
having this experience.
I feel that I'm conscious.
And because other creatures walking around
that look like me, other human beings,
it's a presumption,
probably pretty good one,
that they were having
a similar experience-
but there's really no evidence.
Like, how would I prove
that you are conscious?
That seems outside of the
bounds of empirical science.
What experiment could you ever do
to prove that there is an experience
to be like somebody else?
And that's what the hard problem is.
That's one way it's been expressed.
What is it like to be a bat?
That's a classic example by Nagel.
What is it like to be my dog?
What is it like to be another person?
Presumably, there is something
that it's like to be you,
but there seems to be
no way, scientifically,
to account for why that is-
so that's the hard
problem of consciousness.
How do you explain this?
And a lot of is made out of psychedelics
and their ability to inform
the nature of consciousness.
And so this would be the
ultimate kind of task.
If psychedelics could help us
to crack the hard
problem of consciousness,
I mean, perhaps that's the
biggest question out there.
I mean, it's up there with like,
where did the Universe come from?
What is the nature of reality?
It's really one of the biggies.
In fact, some of the really
interesting questions about:
Is mind, or subjective experience,
something that pops out
of the physical world?
Do we live in this material
world where sort of experience
is just some sort of epiphenomenon?
Or, perhaps, consciousness or experience
is something more fundamental
to the very nature of reality.
And you can go into realms
of philosophical ideas,
such as panpsychism,
the idea that consciousness
really pervades.
It doesn't just emerge,
but it pervades the material universe
in that these are two different
sides of the same coin.
But it seems pretty routine
for people to kind of grapple
with those big questions.
That's why I'm-
I think it's really
important that we separate,
you know, "Hey, a bunch of people say,
based on their experiences,
that they believe
psychedelics open some window
into consciousness or
give them sort of insights
into the nature of consciousness."
But that doesn't constitute
scientific evidence
that what they're saying is actually true.
So it's kind of a weak argument, really.
Just the fact that people tend
to think that psychedelics
have provided them with answers
about the nature of consciousness,
it makes it intriguing to
see if we can go further,
if we can do anything
to really objectively harness psychedelics
to solve some problems of consciousness.
So that's why the inclination is there
to explore psychedelics in the
experience of consciousness.
But we should just be very well-grounded.
And like with any scientific question,
we shouldn't hold our
breaths for the answer.
It's like just pursuing
that journey of questioning
will no doubt come up
with important answers.
They might not be to the
questions we were asking,
but maybe they're to other questions.
And so, if I could think
of an experiment I could do
with psychedelics to
address that question,
I would've already done that experiment.
And right now, I don't think anyone can,
but I think we should remain
open to the possibility
that psychedelics could be used
to address the hard problem.
But we need to think about it
because that really seems like
a difficult problem to crack.
(inquisitive music)
- What medicine is used
in psychedelic therapy sessions?
- In the modern psychedelic
medical renaissance,
the compounds that we're
using are psilocybin, MDMA,
which people may know as Molly
or ecstasy in recreational use, and LSD.
So psilocybin, which people may know
is the active agent in
so-called magic mushrooms.
And in these studies,
it's a plain, white powder
that's identical to what
occurs in the mushrooms,
but it's not the whole mushrooms.
It's the exact number of
milligrams of psilocybin.
A lot of times, we've used 30 milligrams
as a high dose of psilocybin.
So it's a little capsule,
and it contains that.
The other substances are MDMA,
which is also a white powder.
MDMA is not naturally
occurring like psilocybin.
So that's, of course,
just gonna be the synthetic,
white powder given in capsules.
Another drug that's being studied,
I've recently received approval to use LSD
to treat chronic pain.
Most of the research in the
older era with psychedelics
in the '50s and '60s was using LSD.
And so it'll be exciting to
pick back up on that research.
And LSD is, again, not a
naturally occurring compound.
So it's gonna be delivered, in this study,
dissolved in water.
So ketamine is a weird one
because ketamine has been approved
for medical use for
decades as an anesthetic.
But, during the last 20 years,
there's been some really
interesting advancements
in using lower doses of ketamine,
more in the range that
produces psychedelic effects,
using ketamine to treat depression.
And so now one form of ketamine
is actually approved by the
FDA in the United States
as a treatment for depression.
And so, work continues to go on with that.
So right now, one of
the interesting things
about ketamine is that,
and one of the reasons ketamine
has been considered a breakthrough
for the treatment of depression
is that its antidepressant
effects are virtually immediate.
So one of the really big problems
with traditional
antidepressants like SSRIs,
it takes two to three weeks
for them to kick in to start
working, if they work at all.
That's really tough,
especially when you have people
that may be potentially suicidal.
Like, you don't wanna wait
three weeks or four weeks
for these effects to kick in.
So that's really impressive.
But on average, ketamine's
antidepressant effects
will only last about a week.
So that's a pretty short amount of time,
and so it's given repeatedly.
The work from our cancer
study with psilocybin found
that a single high dose
of psilocybin reduced depressive symptoms
for at least six months
with no sign of them returning to normal.
That was just the longest
term follow-up that we had.
Is that because psilocybin is much longer
in its antidepressant effects?
We know that, for both drugs,
it's cleared out of your
system in several hours,
but somehow are the long-term effects
on the brain of psilocybin more powerful?
Or, is it because we
are treating psilocybin
as a psychedelic, as
a psychedelic therapy?
And what I mean by that
is when ketamine is given,
the person is told, "You
might feel a little different,
but ignore that.
That's a side effect.
You'll get through it.
Here, you can watch some TV,
whatever, distract yourself."
And the drug is gonna hit
the right brain receptors,
and hopefully you'll feel better.
And that does seem to
work. That does work.
However, if we really
treat it as a psychedelic
by saying, "You're gonna
have an experience,
you're gonna feel very different.
We want you to pay attention to that,
and we're gonna discuss that experience.
And our hope is that something
about that experience can speak
to the problems that you're having.
We're hoping you can gain
some insights out of this.
We're hoping that it
can kind of reestablish
a new normal for you."
That would be more in the
spirit of a psychedelic therapy.
My bet is that psilocybin
is a superior drug
in treating some of these
mental health disorders.
Actually has some real advantages.
Ketamine can be addictive.
I'm not against its therapeutic use,
but it's no cocaine on the
continuum of addiction,
but one can develop a daily use habit.
It can be a problem for some people.
Psilocybin, it's really unheard of
for someone to be addicted to psilocybin.
We know that from the way
it works in the brain.
So there's some real advantages,
and psilocybin is really robustly,
there's no known lethal
overdose for most people.
There's zero indication
of causing organ damage,
that type of thing.
So psilocybin, on a lot of dimensions,
is just kind of a wonder drug,
and everything has its risk, to be clear.
But if you just came up with a description
of like a really perfect drug
to treat a psychiatric disorder,
you know, psilocybin checks
a lot of those spaces.
Hey, it'd be great if something
wasn't addictive at all itself,
that it was robustly safe
at the physiological level.
You can say that about few
things that are over-the-counter.
So there are some
advantages over ketamine,
and I do get the impression-
although I do want the
head-to-head comparison research,
I'd love to do some of that research-
but my gut tells me that psilocybin
is gonna have more profound,
longer acting effects than
something like ketamine.
- What is the 'heroic dose' given
in a psychedelic therapy session?
- My therapeutic research
with psychedelics
has primarily used psilocybin,
comes in a capsule with a pure compound.
We administer a high dose,
in fact, a dose that's been
called a 'heroic dose;'
it's actually larger than
most recreational doses.
So if a microdose is over here
and a recreational dose is over here,
we're way over here on the continuum.
It'll really knock the
socks off of most people
that are experienced
recreational psychedelic users.
The doses we've given have
really spanned a wide range.
I've done research
where we've given one
milligram of psilocybin,
which is going to be equivalent
to what people are shooting
for with a so-called microdose.
So one milligram of pure
psilocybin would be a microdose.
A recreational dose,
you might say a typical recreational dose
might be 10 milligrams of pure psilocybin.
Now, it's important to keep in mind,
people aren't taking pure
psilocybin outside of the clinic.
They're taking mushrooms.
A microdose may be something
like one gram or half gram
of dried mushroom.
A recreational dose might be,
I don't know, maybe an
eighth ounce of mushrooms,
a typical way they're sold.
They might split it three
ways, two or three ways.
It's probably gonna be about
10 milligrams of psilocybin.
30 milligrams is sort of
the heroic dose level.
And that's has been sort of the high dose
in most of my research.
In terms of typical mushrooms
on the illicit market,
that would be somewhere
in between an eighth-ounce
and a quarter-ounce of mushrooms-
that's a really high dose of mushrooms.
So it's about five dried
grams of mushrooms,
which Terrence McKenna, who's
the famous psychedelic bard,
would refer to repeatedly
as the heroic dose.
Most of my research over the
years has adjusted that dose
by body weight.
So when we've given 30 milligrams,
it's actually been 30
milligrams per 70 kilograms
of a person's body weight;
70 kilograms being about 150 pounds.
So although we've adjusted the dose
that we deliver of psilocybin
by the person's body weight
for most of our research,
we've recently pulled all
the data and figured out,
"Hey, we don't need to be doing that.
We can just give the
same dose for everyone,
no matter how big or small they are."
The dose we now give to patients
is anywhere from 30
milligrams to 40 milligrams,
depending on the study.
And a lot of people these
days talk about microdosing.
There's a lot of buzz about that.
The idea there is taking
a very small amount,
1/20th or 1/10th the amount
of a sort of a normal recreational dose.
So a really trivial
amount of the substance
that's really is gonna cause
a psychedelic experience.
A handful of really
credible, rigorous studies
that have carefully
looked at it have failed
to demonstrate any benefit of microdosing.
So the jury is still out.
There may, in fact, be
some truth to these claims
of various benefits,
antidepressant effects,
anti-ADHD type effects,
pro-creativity effects.
We just don't have the research yet
to conclusively demonstrate
that at this point.
- What is a psychedelic
therapy session like?
- When someone comes in
for the day of their psychedelic session,
they've already spent
several hours with us
on previous days preparing
for the experience,
developing that rapport.
So when they come in on the session day,
we make them feel comfortable.
There's a ceremonial-type setting.
The environment is one-
it's within a hospital,
but it looks more like a living room
than it does a typical hospital room.
So beautiful carpet, beautiful
artwork on the walls;
trying to make it as warm
and inviting as possible
and somewhat ceremonial.
We hand the person the
capsule and sort of a chalice,
and have them swallow that capsule
with a glass of water.
And then it's gonna be anywhere
from 20 minutes to an hour
before the effects start kicking in.
And during that time, we
engage in light discussion.
The center of the room
really has this couch.
And when the experience unfolds,
the person is gonna lay
down with our encouragement,
wear eye shades
and headphones through
which music is played.
So in waiting for those
effects to kick in,
light discussion, we have
some art books in the room,
they can look through some art books.
The idea is can get out
of your normal, everyday,
discursive, analyzing intellect.
And then when those effects kick in,
we really just encourage them
to trust, let go, and be open.
Try to resist the urge of
describing the entire experience.
We say give your thinking side
of your intellect the day off.
You can reunite at the end of the day
and put on your thinking cap.
But during that experience,
embrace more of the
absorptive side of your mind.
Just sort of experience,
collect experiences without judgment,
and we'll discuss it later.
And so at that point,
the guides are really there for support.
If the person's having
some fear or anxiety,
holding the hand or
embracing the shoulder.
We keep it at that 'cause
we're mindful of sexual abuses,
and so wanna keep boundaries
to that physical touch,
but clasping a patient's
hand can be so powerful
in reminding them that
there's another human being
that you trust here that's
watching out for you.
We're not gonna leave you alone.
And it's a five to six-hour experience,
and at some point in the afternoon,
the effects will start to wear off.
And when they do, then the person,
we invite them to sit
up and start processing,
start discussing, just
describe what happened today.
What was it like?
The guides aren't there
to provide any sort of dream
analysis, or, I don't know,
if you had a vision of this monster,
this is exactly what that means.
Nothing like that.
It's really just supportive.
We're letting the person
find their own meaning
in the experience,
and we're there to just support them
and encourage them to take
the experience seriously
and to process it.
We know that all drugs are, in part,
shaped by the context
in which they're given.
But for the psychedelic substances,
that's particularly more so.
So the idea is in the early research,
give someone a big dose of LSD
and stick them in a padded room,
the type of room where you'd keep someone
that's gonna injure themselves
if they're schizophrenic.
So what you get there
is typically a psychotic type of reaction.
So when you provide it
in more of a warm, welcoming situation,
you tend to get more meaningful
reactions to the substance.
There's variability, but
the less likely you are
to have challenging experiences
or so-called bad trips.
And there's a lot of aspects to this.
So the music is one aspect of that.
I did some research finding
that we can switch up the music,
and we found actually,
compared to a classical music playlist,
which has been sort of the
mainstay since the 1950s,
we found that this alternative playlist-
lots of gongs and didgeridoos and drones,
these types of instruments-
found a trend for a little
bit better response.
But it's astonishing how little
work has actually examined,
like, randomized set
and setting variables.
No study, for example has ever
put someone in a rubber room
with a horrible set and setting
versus a really optimized set and setting
to compare the difference.
So much of what we learn
has really just come
from clinical observation,
just the judgment of what we've looked at.
We do have somewhat of a
generic ceremonial style.
So for example, we hand the
capsule over in a chalice,
but it's really divorced from
any particular tradition.
We don't emphasize any,
it just sort of at the level
of this is being taken seriously,
and this is an important moment,
but we're really trying carefully not
to tap into any particular
tradition of any type, per se.
- What are some experiences people have
in their sessions?
- These experiences are
often called "ineffable,"
but as a scientist,
I do my best to F it up
by trying to describe it as much as I can.
So I'll go ahead and do that.
For some people,
a high dose will hit them
like a freight train.
They're feeling barely anything.
And then within a minute, they're floored.
I mean, they're really kind
of psychologically spinning.
It's sort of like, in a sense, vertigo.
Other people, even at a high dose,
it'll creep up over the
next 20 minutes or so.
So there's some variability,
but someone can often be
overwhelmed at the beginning,
and that's particularly challenging.
So that's where our instruction's
to trust, let go, be open:
It can be really helpful
to just surrender to the experience.
If you're just being thrown around,
and you feel like you're in this ocean,
and tidal waves are kind of
taking you one way or another,
just try not to control it.
Just let go and float in that ocean.
Now, this is all in the mind's eye,
so it's hard to give exact instructions.
So whatever the experience
is, we say to surrender to it.
If you feel like you're
being eaten by a monster,
look that monster in the eye,
and ask that monster why it's
there, this type of thing.
But the range of experiences
are just so broad.
Some random examples,
I remember a participant
saying that she just
is reached the end of reality,
this kind of plane of existence
and actually found that,
and it was like this conveyor belt,
and teacups and other objects
were kind of falling across,
falling off the table of
existence, so to speak.
And she took away from that
that she can let go of things.
Like, sometimes you need
to let go of things,
and when it's gone, it's gone,
and you need to move on.
People have sometimes similar experiences
where they feel like
they're witnessing the birth
of the Universe, for example.
Or they confront this infinite void,
this void where there is no
reality, it's completely empty,
but at the same time,
pregnant with potential
and all of the meaning in the Universe;
so some very paradoxical experiences.
People can just have bizarre experience.
Remember one experience where someone,
they were really focused on
the "Foghorn Leghorn" cartoon,
for some reason, during the experience.
People can, oh, reflect on family members,
oftentimes deceased family members,
and feeling like they've
had this revisiting.
Now, people will vary,
I think depending on their personality
and their belief system coming,
whether that's an actual confrontation
with someone on the astral
plane or what have you,
or if it's just a meaningful interaction
within their own mind of their conception
of their loved one who's passed away.
In some sense,
I think it doesn't really
matter how someone holds it,
but people have had some
of these profoundly meaningful experiences
where they, for example, talk to a parent
during their childhood,
and in some, you know,
addressing abusive relationships
and things of this sort.
So really a wide variety of experiences.
Sometimes people can feel,
they'll say that they
can feel the suffering
across the entire planet,
sort of having this sort of
experience of universal empathy,
and just kind of
overwhelmed with the level.
Like, you really can't process
how much suffering there is
in the world.
It's just we're not designed to handle it.
And it seems like, temporarily,
people can kind of be in that place
where they're just aware of
how much suffering there is,
and it can be overwhelming.
Yeah, we say "trust, let go, be open"
as sort of a mission statement,
something easy to remind yourself
and we can remind you during the session.
What does trust mean?
It means trust the overall process,
the fact that this is being contained
within a study at a respected institution,
that there are people
involved with that process
that truly care for your well-being.
The guides in the room with you want this
to be a helpful, meaningful
experience for you.
You know, trust all of these figures
that are involved that have orchestrated,
that have come to this one point in time
for this experience to happen.
Trust your own mind.
This is most I important.
Trust yourself that you're robust,
you're gonna get through this experience.
There is nothing in here
that can ultimately harm you
when you're in this safe
setting for this experience.
So let go. What does let go mean?
Let go means whatever
your preconceived notions
of what this experience might be
or what experience you should have,
don't let that get in the way
for the experience that you will have.
Don't try to control
it. Try to flow with it.
Easier said than done,
but every moment is a new
moment to practice that,
like letting go, that
acceptance of what is,
and to try to learn from whatever that is;
even if it's difficult and
horrendous at the moment.
And be open.
No matter where this takes you, go there.
This is the optimal situation
to follow this experience
wherever it leads.
If you're taking a bunch of
mushrooms at a Phish show,
you don't wanna necessarily
follow every lead.
You're surrounded by a bunch of strangers.
Some of them shouldn't be trusted.
Here, you're in this very safe container
at every possible level.
And so you can really explore
that inner experience,
from laughter to tears,
and knowing that you're
in a safe situation.
I could go on and on, but I don't know.
Hopefully, that, yeah.
- What does the integration phase entail?
- So the integration phase
is where we're discussing
the experience with them.
They write essentially an essay.
We don't call it an essay
'cause that sounds like schoolwork,
but they write a narrative
about the experience
when they go home the
night of their session.
And we use that as a basis
for discussion the next day.
We have them read it to
us when they come in,
and we start to then unpack it,
just kind of explore the meaning.
And the themes that come up are so varied.
One of the aspects is one of,
you could call, 'revealed truth.'
These are experiences
where people will feel like
they've learned something
at such a fundamental level
that they now truly absorb it,
and know it at a deeper level than normal.
So I think of examples
in the work we've done
with cancer patients
where oftentimes people
will say, coming in,
"I know I'm allowing this
to create my own suffering.
I can still get out
there and plan vacations
and spend time in the sunshine.
The cancer hasn't killed me
yet. I can still live life.
But I'm letting it do this to
me. I'm letting it bury me."
And they've told themselves
that, like, a million times.
But sometimes people have
experiences where they get that,
during the psilocybin session,
where they get that so deep down.
The way I put it is like,
they knew it up here,
they could tell you the words,
but now they feel it in their bones,
they feel it in their heart.
So that kind of has its
flavor of revealed truth.
Same thing with smoking.
These things, people come
out, sometimes people say,
"I just realize I could
just decide to quit.
I could just really flick
it off and move on."
I mean, it sounds like, and
I call these "duh" moments,
like, 'cause when people often say it,
they'll tell you, like, "I
realize this sounds stupid.
Like, I've told myself
this a million times,
I know smoking's bad for
me. I've wanted to quit.
What do you mean I could
just decide to quit?
Of course I could decide to quit."
But they feel it so deeply
at this other level,
and we really have a lot
to figure out what's going on there,
but this conviction that
can remain with them.
And I think sometimes these situations,
the reason they feel it so deeply
is that there is a truth there
that somehow they're
normally guarded against.
It's kind of scary to
think that the decision
is ultimately in your-
you have the agency to quit this
or that that's not good for you.
And that's kind of hard to own that.
And people are kind of reminded
about this power they have
to choose their own destiny,
to choose how they're handling
all the horrible input
that they get from the world.
Next to revealed truth,
I'd say there's other experiences
where people say there was nothing new.
And this is pretty common as well,
where they say they
were reminded of things
that they've known and
that they've forgotten.
Sometimes they'll say, like,
they haven't thought about
these things for years
or even decades.
And I remember one participant
that said she just loved poetry.
She wrote poetry in college,
and it was such a
meaningful part of her life
and helped her.
And just, "Why don't I
write poetry anymore?"
So these reminders about these
are things you can do in life
that can help.
- Why does psychedelic therapy seem
to be so effective?
- We don't know much about
how these things interact.
I'll say that the sense of,
and it goes by different terms,
but going beyond the sense of self
or the dissolving of the ego,
it appears that we're tapping
into the same construct
as that sense of oneness or unity,
which is part of the mystical experience.
So there's many different ways, it seems,
to describe this,
somehow this experience of moving outside
of your own self narrative.
And this might be important
with certain disorders
in the sense that, a lot of times,
it seems like you're
getting in your own way,
and you need to get out of your way
to address an addiction
or this pattern of depressive thought,
self-persecutory thought.
And it often occurs to me
that sometimes when someone
has those experiences,
they can step out of it
and have this sense of:
"This is how I would view another person
who had this experience."
I mean, maybe they feel guilty
about this thing they've
been struggling with
or that they've done in their past
or a trauma that they've gone through.
And they're just so self-critical.
They're so self-critical.
And once they have that kind of experience
where they kind of more broadly identify
beyond themselves, they're
able to view themselves
with the compassion
with which they would view another person.
In the science, we know
that in rodents, in rats,
that multiple forms of neuroplasticity
are unfolding in the days after
administering a psychedelic.
What does neuroplasticity mean?
It's just a term that
refers to different ways
in which brain cells,
neurons, can be flexible.
They can grow new branches off of them.
They can form new connections
with different neurons.
Sometimes you can grow new neurons.
So these are different
forms of neuroplasticity.
That's very intriguing,
and it's thought, although not known,
that that might be part of what's going on
in the integration
in these human clinical
trials with psychedelics,
that the same neuroplasticity
that's unfolding in rats
in the days following a
psychedelic experience,
that this may be unfolding
for people as well.
And that might be part of
why people sometimes claim
that they feel that they
have greater flexibility,
they have greater agency.
There's seems like there's
this greater ability
to just make a decision
and follow through with it.
The work I've done, and
generally in the field,
we've avoided doing acute neuroimaging
during these sessions
'cause the strong suspicion
is that you're not gonna
get as good of results
because it's just,
yeah, being in a scanner
is probably the worst set and
setting that you can imagine.
And a lot of people have
difficult times with that.
And that's been shown in
research in Switzerland.
They found, not surprisingly,
that people have worse experiences
when they're in a scanner.
So others in the field have
figured out some things
in non-therapeutic studies
in terms of what's happening in the brain.
But in terms of my research,
what I think is kind of
the biggest question:
What's changed about the brain long-term?
Obviously, it's interesting
what's happening
during the psychedelic experience,
and something interesting
is gonna be happening,
giving how intense the experience is.
But the million dollar question is:
What's different about the
brain six months from now
when someone's successfully quit smoking?
And that's what we're hoping to address,
but I don't have an answer to that yet.
For some studies,
like where we're helping
people quit smoking,
we're seeing them for
several weeks afterwards
for weekly check-in.
And that shifts into more of discussion
about their ongoing
journey in quitting smoking
and kind of fade out the discussion
of the psychedelic session.
Although the amount
of integration contact
differs across studies,
it really is about helping the person
just take seriously the experience,
explore it, find meaning for them.
And we need to figure out what
the key elements of that are.
I mean, really, it seems clinically
that talking about your
experience afterwards seems
to be important and helpful,
but we don't know what the
key elements of that are.
I think just this exploration
of all aspects of your
experience and then searching
for what it means for you seems
that that's very important.
- What role do mystical experiences play?
Are DMT elves real?
- We find that about 2/3 of people
on a high dose of psilocybin
will have a so-called mystical experience.
And we found time and time
again that that is predictive
of whether they're gonna
be improved six months
or longer down the road
across a number of disorders.
However, it's been
overstated at times that,
a mystical experience is not necessary
for someone to have therapeutic benefit.
There's a correlation there,
and it's astonishing to me
that any type of subjective effect,
especially after controlling
for just how strong the drug felt,
that any sort of the nature
of that subjective
experience is predictive
of how much benefit you're
getting six months later.
That's astonishing, but it's
not a perfect correlation.
So plenty of people that fall short
of having the "Full
Monty" mystical experience
claim incredible benefit.
And there are some people
that have the "Full
Monty" mystical experience
that aren't helped so much.
So there is variability,
and we have a whole lot
more to figure out there.
I think it's really clear
when conducting this type of research
that you separate your
exploration of phenomenology,
that is trying to understand
what people are saying
about what their experience was,
versus validating the ground
truth of those experiences.
So it's quite scientifically
appropriate to say,
"How many people felt like they were
at one with the Universe?"
But we have to keep in mind,
that says absolutely zero
in terms of scientific proof
that they were in fact
one with the Universe-
and you could say the same thing
about whether they had
an experience with God
or any other type of
supernatural experience.
So we just need to be careful
to separate those two things.
I liken it to the research on
relationships, for example.
You can look at what personality styles,
what behavioral patterns
are predictive of a successful
marriage, for example.
You can study what people
say about their relationship
and how that relates to whether
it's gonna be successful-
yet you've never captured love.
We're never gonna do that scientifically,
nor will we capture the existence of God
or any other similar concept.
And that really is, though, a struggle.
I did some research on these
so-called entity experiences
that people sometimes have,
whether it's interpreted as an alien
or an angel or an elf.
But sometimes when people,
especially when they do
very powerful psychedelics,
like they smoke DMT, they'll
report encountering an entity.
It's scientifically credible to say,
"Yeah, a good number of people
that do this drug think they
encountered some entity."
And hopefully we can figure out eventually
what specific brain
mechanisms are underlying that
and the therapeutic import
that may or may not have.
But it says exactly zero
about whether you actually
encountered an angel
or an alien, etc.
- Why are psychedelics poised
to treat so many conditions?
- The work, so far, that
most advanced research,
is using psychedelics in
the treatment of depression
and end of life or, in the
context of serious illness,
such as cancer, anxiety, and depression,
within that context,
and then depression
outside of medical illness,
and then a variety of forms of addiction.
Other disorders that either I'm studying
or colleagues are studying
are obsessive compulsive disorder,
anorexia, different forms of addiction,
including cocaine addiction,
alcohol addiction.
I'm about to start work on
using psilocybin to treat PTSD.
And based on that rat
research of neuroplasticity,
of athletes that have sustained injury
through repetitive head
impact that are claiming
that using psychedelics have
restored cognitive ability,
as well as doing things like helping them
with depression and addiction.
So I'm interested in pursuing that work.
So there's just a whole
lot that's out there.
So some of those areas
are being researched,
and we don't have results yet,
and so we can't get ahead of the data.
I think there's a good rationale
to study all of these things.
Some of them might work out, hopefully,
and some of them, we might
run up against a boundary.
It might be good for this, this, and that,
but not this and that.
The research, so far, has
been focused on adults
that are 18 or older
in most of the studies.
However, as we continue the research,
we're gonna need to look
at younger populations.
In fact, this is something
that the FDA really wants.
It doesn't matter
whether it's psychedelics
or something else.
Like, if it looks really
beneficial in adults,
there's a mandate to really explore this
because adolescents suffer
from depression and addictions, etc.
The way I view it is that just
an extra level of caution.
That's not where you start.
First, see how things work in adults,
and there are extra concerns
about the developing brain,
but there's concerns about
untreated mental illness, right?
Including suicides,
including overdoses, etc.
So there's a risk in not exploring this,
but being very, very cautious.
In the biggest picture,
aside from psychedelic's ability
to treat one disorder or another,
I think they're just
poised to really help us
to understand the nature
of psychiatric disorders.
I mean, the fact that
we're seeing a similar,
the same intervention, really,
be helpful for depression and anxiety,
whether it's in the context
of cancer or outside of it,
helping with not just
one form of addiction
but multiple forms of addiction,
this is really unheard of,
and it should be screaming to us
to look for these so-called
'trans-diagnostic processes.'
Like, what's underlying
these different disorders?
What commonalities do
they have with each other
that are somehow being addressed
by psychedelic treatment?
I mean, I've come to think of it-
perhaps because understanding addiction
is really kind of a foundation for me-
I kind of think of all of these disorders
as different forms of addiction.
So whether it's to a substance,
like tobacco or alcohol, cocaine,
or a way of thinking about
yourself in depression,
the self-persecutory
thoughts that we all have,
but that are overexpressed
in someone with depression,
and once you're in it,
it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Once you spend a lot of your
day calling yourself a failure
and then that rubs off on other people,
and you spiral downward-
that is an addiction.
It's this narrowed mental
and behavioral repertoire.
You have been narrowed.
Reality used to be like this,
and now your reality is like this.
And wherever that's taking to a substance,
or to a certain suboptimal way
of thinking about yourself.
And psychedelics, when done
well in the right setting,
have the ability to just blow people
out of that narrowed story.
So I think that's like really big picture.
It holds a lot of promise
in helping us figure out
what the nature of mental disorders are,
and also how to prevent those disorders.
How can we move towards a society
where we're not just primarily focused
on treating disorders?
But what creates, for the
psychologically healthy person,
how can we have preventative
care and mental health care?
And it really just hits home for me
because I've done lots of
studies treating disorders
with psychedelics and
a lot of other studies
where we're just treating
so-called healthy normals,
as if they don't have any problems.
And guess what?
You give a big dose of a psychedelic
to a human being in a prepared setting,
and boy, that stuff, those problems,
whether you're diagnosable or not,
that trauma from the past,
those various forms of
addiction of whatever type,
they kind of come to the surface.
And so I think psychedelics, big picture,
can help us move towards
a world where we start
to understand what it takes
for the human being to
be mentally healthy.
What can we do in the
spirit of prevention?
Maybe psychedelics will
play some role in that,
but maybe they'll also
point us to other techniques
that will allow us to
keep ourselves healthy.
Some people come out of these
sessions as participants
and say that one six-hour
experience with psilocybin
is like 1,000 hours of therapy.
It does seem that
psychedelics, when they work,
it's because they're getting closer
to the roots of psychological problems
rather than treating them
at the surface level,
which is the way most
psychiatric medications
will treat mental health disorders,
more at the surface level.
But this is why it appears, so far,
that it might only take
one, two, or three exposures
in the right setting to a psychedelic,
and that may be enough to
really treat these disorders.
In some cases, it can appear
more like a cure, not always,
but I don't use that term lightly.
But sometimes it looks like a cure
'cause it really looks like
people have resolved deep,
underlying psychological issues
that are kind of manifesting
these various symptoms
for whatever disorder.
I'm not aware of any evidence
that big pharma has been blocking
or is scared of psychedelic research.
They certainly traditionally
haven't invested in it.
I think they're sort of sitting back.
It's mainly small venture
capitalist start-ups
that are exploring psychedelics
and investing in their
potential development
through the FDA pathway.
But that's been the trend
for mental health drugs for a while now.
Let the small companies
make these investments,
and if they come up with
promising findings early on,
then the big pharma companies come in
and pay the millions of dollars
to buy those companies out
and move forward with it.
So I think they're waiting in the wings,
but it's a very different model
where you're not gonna
be making a whole lot
of money selling that
pill on a daily basis.
Hopefully, you're only selling
one, two, or three pills
to someone over their
lifetime if it works.
So more of the business model,
but it would be one of the infrastructure
and the professional guidance
through these sessions.
