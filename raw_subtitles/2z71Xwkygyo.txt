Hello
 there,
 OddLotss
 listeners.
 You
 are


about
 to
 listen
 to
 a
 very
 special


episode.
 This
 is
 a
 conversation
 recorded


live
 at
 our
 recent
 event
 in
 New
 York.


That's
 right.
 We
 had
 a
 live
 OddLotss


event
 on
 June
 26th.
 We
 had
 tons
 of


conversations.
 We're
 going
 to
 be
 rolling


them
 out
 in
 the
 uh
 days
 ahead.
 But
 the


first
 one
 we
 want
 to
 bring
 you
 was
 our


headliner
 for
 the
 night,
 uh
 Jim
 Chenos.


That's
 right.
 The
 famed
 shortseller.
 He


was
 there
 giving
 us
 all
 his
 thoughts
 on


the
 market
 right
 now.
 So,
 take
 a
 listen.


All
 right.
 First
 question.
 Are
 Bitcoin


Treasury
 companies
 the
 stupidest
 thing


you've
 ever
 seen
 in
 your
 entire
 life?


[Applause]


You
 know,
 it's
 rarely
 rarely
 that
 I
 have


to
 increase
 my
 personal
 security
 after
 a


podcast,
 which
 I
 had
 to
 do
 after
 your


our
 last
 podcast
 together
 when
 I
 uh
 sent


some
 inmperate
 things
 about
 Bitcoin


Treasury
 companies.


Look,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 here's
 the
 thing.
 I


I
 get
 people
 very
 agitated
 about
 this


and
 and
 they
 get
 they
 they
 point
 out
 on


just
 what
 a
 genius
 idea
 this
 is
 and
 I


keep
 trying
 to
 point
 out
 to
 them
 I'm


doing
 the
 same
 thing
 that
 guys
 like


Michael
 Sailor
 are
 doing.
 I'm
 on
 the


same
 side
 of
 the
 trade.
 And
 I
 keep


pointing
 out
 to
 my
 critics,
 you're
 on


the
 opposite
 side
 of
 that
 trade.
 And
 you


don't
 want
 to
 be
 on
 the
 opposite
 side
 of


the
 trade.
 And
 the
 Bitcoin
 Treasury


paradox
 being
 that
 you
 are
 the
 one


buying
 the
 pieces
 of
 paper
 that
 have


infinite
 supply
 so
 that
 Michael
 Sailor


and
 I
 can
 buy
 the
 digital
 asset
 with
 the


limited
 supply.
 And
 it
 makes
 kind
 of
 no


sense.
 So
 what
 will
 inevitably
 happen
 is


happening
 in
 that
 is
 there's
 nothing


proprietary
 here.
 This
 is
 just
 simply


raising
 capital
 to
 buy
 a
 financial
 asset


and
 other
 companies
 will
 do
 this.
 And
 in


fact
 even
 since
 the
 podcast
 we
 last
 did


I
 think
 the
 the
 number
 of
 companies
 that


have
 announced
 this
 strategy
 is
 you
 know


scores
 more.
 I
 think
 there's
 over
 a


hundred
 in
 the
 US
 and
 over
 200
 globally


now.
 So
 who's
 actually
 buying
 Micro


Strategy?
 cuz
 you
 know
 I
 thought


everybody
 on
 my
 timeline.
 Okay.
 But
 I


thought
 once
 the
 spot
 ETFs,
 the
 spot


bitcoin
 ETFs
 came
 out
 like
 this
 business


model
 would
 go
 away
 and
 it
 hasn't.
 No.


And
 because
 there's
 there's
 a
 wonderful


sales
 job
 that's
 being
 done
 about
 the


fact
 that
 this
 is
 an
 economic
 engine
 in


and
 of
 itself.
 And
 so
 therefore
 terms


like
 Bitcoin
 yield
 are
 are
 used
 and
 and


I've
 called
 them
 financial
 gibberish


because
 they
 are.
 and
 and
 in
 fact
 this


will
 get
 arbed
 away
 ultimately
 by


companies
 that
 will
 do
 this
 uh
 to
 try
 to


capture
 that
 spread.
 In
 the
 case
 of


Micro
 Strategy,
 it's
 substantial.
 It's


still


$50
 billion
 something
 like
 that
 of
 the


difference
 between
 the
 value
 of
 the


enterprise
 value
 of
 the
 company
 and
 the


value
 of
 their
 Bitcoin
 holdings.
 But
 the


thing
 that
 really
 kind
 of
 shot
 me
 into


orbit
 on
 all
 this
 was
 when


Sailor
 and
 others
 then
 said,"Well,
 no,


you
 can't
 really
 value
 us
 on
 an
 NAV


basis,
 a
 so-called
 MNAV
 multiple
 of
 NAV.


You
 actually
 have
 to
 also
 give
 us


additional
 value
 for
 the
 amount
 of


profit
 that
 we
 make
 every
 quarter
 from


the
 appreciation
 in
 the
 asset."


I
 said
 I
 just
 pointed
 out
 I
 said,
 "Well,


that's
 like
 saying,
 you
 know,
 my
 whole


net
 worth
 is
 in
 a
 house
 that's
 worth


$400,000
 that
 that
 is
 now
 worth
 $500,000


a
 year
 or
 two
 later.
 And
 my
 net
 worth
 is


not
 $500,000
 now.
 It's
 $2.5
 million


because
 it's
 the
 value
 of
 the
 house
 plus


a
 multiple
 on
 the
 increase
 in
 the


profitability
 of
 the
 asset."
 When
 you


put
 it
 that
 way,
 it
 sounds
 a
 little


absurd.
 It
 is
 absurd.


There's
 like
 200
 of
 them
 now,
 right?
 I


It's
 over
 200
 globally.
 Yeah,
 that's


that's
 uh
 Wait,
 I
 have
 one
 more


question.
 Why
 did
 Micro
 I
 have
 to


remember
 to
 call
 them
 strategy,
 but
 I


can't
 bring
 myself
 to
 do
 it.
 Um
 why
 did


they
 switch
 from
 issuing
 the
 convertible


debt
 to
 preferred
 shares?
 Because
 he


realized
 that
 as
 he
 began
 to
 issue
 more


and
 more
 common,
 it
 was
 putting
 pressure


on
 the
 premium.
 So
 now
 the
 latest


iteration
 is
 well
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 this


quasi
 equity
 security
 quasi
 debt


preferred
 stock
 and
 uh
 then
 we
 can


torque
 up
 we
 can
 lever
 up
 the
 the


balance
 sheet.
 Now,
 this
 is
 a
 company


whose
 selling
 point
 a
 year
 ago
 was
 we're


not
 going
 to
 lever
 because
 we
 have
 this


wonderful
 equity
 that
 we
 can
 issue
 at
 a


premium.
 And
 now
 they're
 saying,
 well,


you
 know,
 if
 maybe
 if
 it
 trades
 above


2x,
 we'll
 issue
 equity,
 but
 if
 it's


between
 one
 and
 2x,
 we'll
 do
 preferred.


And
 then
 if
 it's
 below
 one
 times,
 we'll


buy
 back
 common.
 And
 then
 what
 is


chainos
 going
 to
 do?
 To
 which
 I
 said,


well,
 I'll
 be
 out
 of
 the
 trade
 by
 then.


You
 know,
 if
 it's
 a
 one
 times
 NAV,
 it's


not
 a
 trade.
 So
 that's
 kind
 of
 the
 the


latest
 game
 plan,
 but
 stay
 tuned.
 It'll


change.
 I
 think
 the
 narrative
 keeps


changing.
 The
 other
 one
 is
 of
 course


that
 Micro
 Strategy
 will
 be
 put
 in
 the


S&P
 500
 and
 so
 that
 will
 be
 untold


riches
 for
 everyone
 that
 doesn't
 know


that's
 going
 to
 happen.
 Um,
 we
 got
 to


move
 off
 this
 topic
 because
 I
 just
 find


it
 so
 depressing.
 You
 know,
 like
 I
 read


the
 news
 and
 they're
 like,
 oh,
 like,
 you


know,
 some
 big
 breakthrough
 with


batteries
 in
 China
 is
 happening
 or


whatever
 and
 then
 the
 big


entrepreneurial
 innovation
 in
 the
 United


States
 is
 the
 200th
 company
 that's


borrowing
 money.
 Like,
 it's
 too
 bleak


when
 you
 really
 think
 about
 it's
 too


bleak
 to
 contemplate.


[Applause]


So,
 on
 Tuesday
 or
 Wednesday
 morning,


shares
 in
 real
 estate
 companies
 fell


after
 victory.
 What's
 your
 take
 on
 uh


New
 York
 City
 real
 estate
 these
 days?


Well,
 I
 I
 I
 guess
 I'm
 glad
 I
 sold
 my


apartment
 last
 year.
 Um
 but
 but
 uh
 look,


I
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 surprised.


Clearly,
 New
 York
 City
 real
 estate
 and


commercial
 real
 estate
 will
 be


challenged
 if
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 happen


that
 the
 current
 front
 runner,
 you
 know,


wants
 to
 happen.
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 restrictions
 that
 will
 be
 put
 in


front
 of
 making
 some
 of
 that
 stuff


happen.
 But
 my
 friends
 in
 New
 York
 City


commercial
 real
 estate
 have
 said
 really


the
 regulatory
 framework
 and
 the


legislative
 framework
 in
 New
 York
 and


New
 York
 City
 has
 done
 nothing
 but
 get


worse
 over
 the
 last
 15
 years.
 And
 I'm


kind
 of
 stunned
 that
 that
 some
 of
 the


publicly
 traded
 um
 companies
 like


Vornnado
 and
 SL
 Green
 still
 have
 the
 cap


rates
 as
 low
 as
 they
 do.
 I
 mean
 SLG
 we


looked
 at
 yesterday
 and
 its
 cap
 rate
 is


still
 5.2%.


You're
 short
 SLG
 now.
 We've
 been
 we've


been
 short
 SLG
 on
 and
 off
 for
 for
 a


number
 of
 years
 and
 we
 are
 again.
 Um
 and


I
 just
 I
 don't
 get
 the
 riskreward
 on
 on


a
 5.2%
 cap
 rate
 on
 New
 York
 City


commercial
 real
 estate
 right
 now.
 I


think
 it
 should
 be
 seven
 or
 eight.


Right.
 You
 can
 get
 four
 and
 a
 half%
 by


buying
 a
 treasury.
 Right.
 Exactly.
 Yeah.


And
 so
 if
 you're
 buying
 it
 at
 52,
 you're


And
 that
 that's
 read
 accounting.
 Read


accounting
 is
 also
 pretty
 pretty


squirly,
 by
 the
 way,
 for
 a
 lot
 of


reasons.
 you
 know,
 they
 don't
 include


overhead
 in
 the
 cap
 rate.
 And
 of
 course,


there
 is
 real
 depreciation
 in
 some
 of


this
 stuff.
 There's
 maintenance
 capex
 in


New
 York
 City.
 It's
 pretty
 high.
 And


that
 doesn't
 include
 any
 capex.
 So,
 I


don't
 get
 it.
 I
 don't
 see
 rents
 going
 up


here.
 I
 guess
 it
 would
 be
 the
 easiest


way.
 And
 that'd
 be
 the
 only
 reason
 you'd


be
 buying
 office
 buildings
 at
 a
 five


cap.
 What
 about
 residential?
 Yeah.
 I


mean,
 you
 know,
 it's
 weird.
 I
 mean,
 your


audience
 knows
 better
 than
 I
 do.
 I
 mean,


it's
 it's
 it's
 problematic
 in
 so
 many


ways.
 U
 there's
 not
 enough
 supply.


There's
 all
 kinds
 of
 weird
 regulations.


Things
 are
 expensive.
 And
 you
 can
 kind


of
 see
 why
 M
 Dami's
 message
 resonated


with
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 A
 lot
 of
 it
 has
 to


do
 with
 the
 cost
 of
 living
 here.
 Have


you
 been
 on
 the
 receiving
 end
 or
 I
 guess


dialing
 of
 any
 of
 the
 calls
 to
 gather


capital
 for
 a
 uh
 a
 challenger?
 Um
 well,


I'm
 I'm
 not
 a
 New
 Yorker
 anymore,
 but


the
 answer
 is
 yeah,
 but
 receiving
 or


calling?
 Receiving.
 I'm
 not
 calling.
 Um,


but
 uh
 yeah,
 sure.
 And
 uh
 who
 who
 are


they
 saying?
 Who
 who
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 get
 into
 that.
 Those
 are


private
 conversations.
 I
 think
 I
 think


they're
 all
 pretty
 pretty
 silly
 at
 this


point.
 Yeah,
 it
 was
 a
 good
 try,
 Joe.


Yeah,
 I
 try.
 Okay.
 Well,
 since
 we


mentioned
 the
 word
 bleak
 a
 couple
 times


um
 in
 these
 conversations
 now,
 is
 it


bleak
 being
 a
 short
 seller
 in
 the


current
 market?


Well,
 it's
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 fun.
 Um,
 but
 it


it's
 never
 really
 been
 fun.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I


started
 my
 original
 fund
 back
 in
 ' 85.


The
 Dow
 was
 at
 1300.
 So,
 it's
 it's


pretty
 much
 and
 you
 know,
 we
 started


hedging
 back
 in
 96.


So,
 you
 know,
 it's
 it's
 it's
 always
 a


slug.
 It's
 never
 easy.
 It's
 why
 a
 lot
 of


people
 don't
 do
 it.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,


the
 idiosyncratic
 opportunities,
 most


things
 fail
 as
 you
 know
 and
 the


idiosyncratic
 opportunities
 have


probably
 never
 been
 greater
 given
 the


market
 we
 have
 now
 and
 with
 things
 like


Bitcoin
 treasury
 companies
 and
 all
 kinds


of
 other
 things.
 They
 just
 are
 sort
 of


headscratchers
 and
 are
 a
 function
 of


general
 animal
 spirits.
 So,
 there's
 a


lot
 to
 do
 and
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 fun


part
 of
 what
 I
 do
 is
 there's
 a
 lot
 to
 do


and
 seemingly
 more
 every
 year,
 but
 some


of
 the
 stuff
 going
 on
 right
 now
 is
 a
 bit


of a
 headscratcher
 and
 we
 don't
 try
 to


predict
 where
 the
 market's
 going,
 but


the
 animal
 spirits
 are
 definitely
 back.


You
 know,
 it's
 like
 several
 years
 ago
 or


2021,
 people
 could
 have
 blamed
 ZER.
 It's


like,
 oh,
 it's
 cuz
 the
 rates
 are
 at
 zero


and
 that's
 why
 everyone's
 going
 crazy.


And
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 really
 interesting


how
 much
 speculative
 activity
 has


persisted
 and
 the
 ZERP
 excuse
 does
 not


hold
 water
 anymore.
 So
 we
 got
 to
 find
 uh


we
 got
 to
 find
 something
 new.
 Speaking


of
 idiosyncratic
 opportunities,
 one


thing
 you've
 been
 talking
 about
 a
 lot


and
 multiple
 times
 on
 the
 show
 is
 um
 the


data
 center
 reach
 and
 Equinex
 I
 think


just
 had
 two
 terrible
 days
 in
 a
 row.


What's
 going
 on
 with
 them?
 So
 these
 are


the
 companies
 that
 have
 clouds
 but


they're
 not
 like
 the
 hyperscalers
 like


what's
 their
 So
 I
 I
 think
 the
 legacy


data
 centers
 and
 there's
 only
 a
 couple


companies
 out
 in
 the
 United
 States
 that


that
 really
 have
 legacy
 data
 centers.


There's
 Equinex,
 there's
 Digital
 Realy,


and
 then
 there's
 a
 sort
 of
 the
 old


Colony
 Capital
 is
 now
 called
 Digital


Bridge,
 and
 they
 own
 these
 things
 sort


of
 in
 fund
 format.
 And
 when
 we
 took
 a


look
 at
 this
 with
 our
 our
 partner
 back


in
 22,
 the
 idea
 was
 pretty
 simple
 and


and
 we
 did
 not
 see
 the
 AI
 explosion
 in


in
 mid22,
 but
 the
 idea
 was
 it
 was
 a


pretty
 crummy
 business
 then
 working
 on


the
 cloud
 and
 SAS
 demand.
 uh
 but
 it


became
 a
 really
 bad
 business
 with
 the


advent
 of
 AI
 because
 it
 just
 moved
 the


hyperscalers
 to
 invest
 more
 in


state-of-the-art
 data
 centers
 and
 these


are
 older
 data
 centers
 that
 were
 short


and
 the
 idea
 being
 that
 that
 the
 new
 GPU


centric
 data
 centers
 need
 liquid
 cooling


they
 basically
 need
 all
 the


infrastructure
 ripped
 out
 and
 replaced


and
 the
 business
 was
 not
 a
 high
 return


on
 capital
 business
 before
 this
 it's


getting
 even
 worse
 now
 and
 what
 Equinex


said
 uh
 yesterday
 at
 their
 analyst
 day


was
 that
 revenues
 were
 not
 going
 to


quite
 be
 what
 people
 thought
 they
 would


be,
 but
 more
 ominously
 capex
 was
 going


to
 keep
 increasing.
 And
 that's
 what


we've
 been
 saying
 that
 that
 these
 are


not
 like
 warehouses
 where
 you
 just
 kind


of
 collect
 a
 check.
 These
 are
 actually


operating
 businesses
 where
 you
 have
 to


service
 the
 the
 the
 servers.
 You
 have
 to


make
 sure
 there's
 redundancy.
 It's
 just


it's
 a
 business,
 a
 tech
 business.
 and
 um


they're
 traded
 as
 REITs
 and
 that
 was


kind
 of
 the
 opportunity
 that
 was
 the
 the


sort
 of
 dichotomy
 in
 valuation.
 So


people
 added
 back
 the
 depreciation
 as


they
 do
 with
 REITs
 and
 they
 valued
 them


on
 a
 so-called
 FFO
 or
 AFO
 which
 is
 a


cash
 flow
 metric
 but
 in
 fact
 unlike


warehouses
 shopping
 centers
 to
 lesser


extent
 office
 buildings
 the
 capex
 was


real
 depreciation
 was
 a
 real
 expense.
 So


to
 give
 you
 an
 example
 with
 Equinex


yesterday,
 they
 said
 our
 capex
 is
 now


going
 to
 bump
 up
 to
 between
 four
 and


five
 billion
 a
 year.
 The
 problem
 is


their
 EBIT
 DA
 this
 year
 is
 expected
 to


be
 4.5
 billion.
 So
 all
 of
 that's
 going


to
 go
 to
 capex,
 meaning
 they're
 going
 to


have
 to
 basically
 borrow
 or
 issue
 equity


to
 pay
 their
 interest
 in
 dividends.
 And


that's
 just
 a
 definition
 of
 a
 bad


business.
 And
 it's
 a
 business
 that's
 not


growing
 very
 fast.
 So
 unlike
 other


really
 true
 AI
 companies
 which
 are


growing
 25
 30
 40%
 a
 year,
 these
 guys
 are


growing
 3%
 5%
 6%
 sort
 of
 with
 GDP.
 So


there's
 no
 growing
 their
 way
 out
 of


this.
 Um
 and
 and
 so
 they're
 just
 really


bad
 businesses
 trading
 at
 at
 just


nosebleleed
 valuations.


[Music]


On
 the
 topic
 of
 idiosyncratic


opportunities,
 I
 got
 to
 ask
 about


Carvana
 cuz
 when
 my
 husband
 and
 I
 moved


back
 to
 the
 States
 in
 2022,


we
 bought
 a
 used
 car
 through
 Carvana
 and


that
 was
 a
 mistake
 cuz
 it
 took
 us
 about


6
 months
 to
 actually
 get
 the
 car
 and


they
 lost
 lost
 all
 our
 paperwork
 and
 it


was
 just
 an
 absolute
 nightmare.
 And
 I


thought
 at
 the
 time,
 this
 is
 a
 company


whose
 entire
 business
 model
 is
 basically


built
 on
 regulation,
 right?
 Like
 that's


what
 they're
 doing.
 And
 I
 thought,


they're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 a
 future
 if


they
 are
 this
 bad
 at
 it.
 And
 yet
 the


stock
 is
 up.
 It's
 done
 insanely
 well.


Yeah.
 Well,
 it's
 it's
 it's
 done
 it's


done
 a
 double
 round
 trip,
 right?
 It
 it


it
 crashed
 99%
 and
 now
 it's
 up
 100x.
 So


um
 it's
 pretty
 interesting
 again
 and
 and


the
 reason
 it's
 interesting
 is
 that
 if


you
 go
 through
 the
 numbers
 they
 are


making
 more
 than
 100%
 of
 their
 pre-tax


profit
 from
 gain
 on
 sale
 of
 loans


subprime
 loans
 and
 gain
 on
 sale
 of


equity
 stakes
 in
 other
 companies.
 And


you
 x
 those
 two
 out
 they're
 losing
 money


and
 they're
 losing
 money
 now
 right
 after


the
 rebound
 after
 the
 restructuring
 from


2022
 2023.


And
 this
 is
 a
 company
 that
 is
 being


valued
 again
 as
 a
 secular
 growth
 stock


that
 saw
 its
 used
 car
 revenues
 drop
 30%


between
 2022
 and
 2023.


So
 it's
 not
 necessarily
 a
 secular
 growth


company.
 The
 accounting
 is
 abysmal.
 And


then
 what
 people
 are
 really
 missing
 is


that
 what's
 happening
 in
 subprime
 auto


uh
 securizations
 right
 now
 and
 you
 can


track
 it
 on
 your
 Bloomberg
 terminal.
 Um


delinquencies
 are
 starting
 to
 skyrocket.


Yeah,
 we
 actually
 did
 an
 episode
 on
 this


recently
 with
 Jim
 Egan.
 Yeah.
 And
 so


again,
 a
 huge
 amount
 of
 their
 profits


comes
 from
 selling,
 you
 know,
 generating


paper
 from
 customers
 and
 then
 selling
 it


into
 the
 open
 market
 or
 to
 affiliates.


And
 this
 is
 a
 company
 that
 is
 was
 spun


out
 of
 a
 company
 called
 Drive
 Time


Finance,
 which
 is
 their
 affiliated


finance
 company,
 which
 was
 originally


called
 Ugly
 Duckling
 in
 the
 late
 90s,


which
 was
 run
 by
 the
 current
 CEO's


father.
 And
 that
 company
 collapsed
 in


the
 first
 subprime
 blowup,
 which
 was
 not


the
 GFC.
 It
 was
 actually
 in
 the
 late
 90s


in
 subprime
 auto
 credit
 and
 and
 consumer


loans.
 And
 um
 it
 didn't
 go
 bankrupt,
 but


it
 came
 close.
 And
 he
 had
 to
 restructure


it.
 He
 bought
 it
 bought
 it
 in
 private


and
 then
 restructured
 it,
 renamed
 it


drive
 time
 Finance.
 But
 that's
 the


genesis
 of
 Carvana.
 That's
 its
 DNA.
 It's


basically
 a
 subprime
 finance,
 you
 know,


lead
 company.
 if
 you
 will.
 And
 those


companies
 should
 not
 trade
 at
 40
 and
 50


times
 um
 expected
 earnings
 and
 they


don't
 by
 and
 large.
 They're
 consumer


finance
 companies.
 So,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


it's
 a
 odd
 bird.
 It's
 still
 heavily


leveraged.
 The
 stock
 is
 up
 a
 ton.
 But


what
 really
 got
 us
 interested
 again


recently
 was
 the
 vast
 amount
 of
 insider


selling
 that
 has
 just
 started
 in
 May
 and


June
 in
 the
 company.
 If
 you
 go
 look
 at


the
 insider
 selling
 in
 the
 company,
 it


is
 just
 now
 a
 torrent
 of
 everybody


selling
 like
 pretty
 much
 every
 day.
 And


uh
 I
 we
 just
 don't
 think
 that's
 a
 good


sign
 given
 what's
 happening
 in
 the


subprime
 securization
 market.
 One
 area


of
 the
 financial
 ecosystem
 that
 you've


been
 cynical
 about
 it
 uh
 cynical
 about


for
 a
 long
 time
 is
 sort
 of
 private


equity
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 private
 assets.


And
 something
 that
 um
 I've
 been
 talking


to
 some
 people
 about
 is
 or
 and
 that
 you


hear
 people
 talk
 about
 is
 not
 so
 much


necessarily
 that
 the
 values
 have
 gone


down
 though
 probably
 many
 cases
 that


they
 have
 but
 that
 it's
 been
 a
 long
 time


since
 LPS
 etc
 have
 gotten
 distributions


etc
 whether
 it's
 venture
 at
 the
 venture


level
 the
 PE
 level
 how
 long
 can
 that
 go


on
 where
 it's
 like
 people
 are
 not


getting
 cash
 out
 yeah
 so
 um
 before
 it


becomes
 a
 real
 problem
 so
 I
 really
 kind


of
 got
 much
 more
 interested
 in
 this


area,
 serving
 on
 on
 a
 couple
 of
 big


investment
 committees
 in
 Manhattan
 and


one
 of
 which
 had
 a
 really
 really
 huge


slug
 of
 our
 assets
 of
 this
 uh
 of
 this


nonprofit
 in
 privates
 in
 private
 equity


for
 the
 most
 part,
 a
 little
 bit
 of


venture,
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 real
 estate.


And
 what
 always
 struck
 me
 was
 was
 that


we
 we
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 talking
 about


the
 market,
 talking
 about
 our
 managers,


talking
 about
 why
 hedge
 funds
 were


terrible.
 And
 then
 we'd
 get
 to
 the
 part


about
 private
 and
 they
 say,
 "Well,
 the


returns
 are
 lagged
 by
 a
 quarter,
 so
 you


know,
 here
 they
 are
 and
 let's
 move
 on."


And
 I
 started
 looking
 at
 the
 numbers
 and


this
 was
 a
 this
 is
 a
 fund
 that
 that
 had


all
 the
 the
 the
 premier
 firms,
 the
 ones


you
 all
 know.
 and


gee
 stock
 market's
 doing
 awfully
 well


and
 we're
 kind
 of
 doing
 10%
 11%
 in
 terms


of
 realized
 returns
 and
 then
 uh


estimated
 IRR
 which
 is
 problematic
 for


reasons
 a
 lot
 of
 your
 audience
 knows
 and


um
 is
 it
 just
 me
 or
 are
 we
 not


understanding
 we're
 leverage
 long
 equity


in
 these
 entities
 and
 yet
 we're


underperforming
 the
 indices


That
 was
 five,
 six
 years
 ago.
 And
 I


think
 that
 that's
 only
 gotten
 worse


since.
 And
 so
 I'm
 really
 beginning
 to


wonder
 private
 equity
 was
 considered
 a


panacea
 for
 nonprofits
 and
 and


foundations,
 endowments,
 because


basically,
 as
 my
 friend
 Cliff
 A
 said,
 it


was
 volatility,
 you
 know,
 laundering,
 if


you
 will,
 because
 no
 one
 ever
 showed
 you


a
 big
 down
 quarter.
 But
 now
 we're


getting
 to
 the
 point
 where
 a
 lot
 of


these
 funds
 are
 really
 mature
 and
 the


actual
 returns
 themselves
 are
 not
 going


to
 be
 mid-
 teens
 with
 low
 volatility.


They're
 going
 to
 be
 high
 single
 digits,


low
 double
 digits.
 And
 we
 can
 look
 at


the
 S&P
 and
 say,
 okay,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 I'm


doing
 better
 in
 that
 and
 I
 I'm
 liquid


and
 I'm
 not
 paying
 fees.
 And
 so
 I


suspect
 that
 private
 equity
 and


ultimately
 private
 credit
 are
 going
 to


be
 where
 hedge
 funds
 found
 themselves
 10


to
 15
 years
 ago
 having
 to
 justify
 their


existence
 after
 having
 a
 pretty
 good
 run


from
 the
 late
 90s
 to
 to
 the
 GFC.
 I


suspect
 that's
 where
 we
 are
 in
 private


equity.
 It'll
 still
 be
 a
 very
 lucrative


business,
 but
 I
 just
 think
 its
 golden


days
 are
 are
 over
 where
 it
 was
 just
 a


free
 lunch
 of
 mid-
 teen
 returns
 with
 no


volatility.
 Does
 anyone
 ever
 ask
 you


what
 you're
 bullish
 on?
 Should
 I
 ask?


I
 look
 I
 we're
 we're
 long
 equities,


right?
 We're
 long
 stuff.
 A
 lot
 of
 people


in
 the
 audience
 are
 long.
 Give
 us
 an


example.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 we're
 long


indices,
 so
 we're
 long
 general
 corporate


America.
 I
 just,
 you
 know,
 I
 just
 hate


this
 stuff.
 I'm
 short.


I
 thought
 you
 weren't
 supposed
 to
 get


emotional
 about
 investing
 every
 once
 in


a
 while.
 So
 yeah,
 it's
 uh
 and
 there's


one
 other
 thing
 though
 I
 I
 do
 want
 to


mention
 and
 that
 is
 I
 was
 talking
 to


someone
 earlier
 today
 and
 I
 think
 one
 of


the
 things
 that's
 underappreciated
 by


investors
 right
 now
 and
 and
 one
 of
 the


things
 that's
 been
 most
 interesting
 to


me
 is
 how
 corporate
 profit
 margins
 have


have
 held
 up
 which
 used
 to
 be
 very
 mean


reverting
 as
 you
 know
 and
 um
 the
 more


work
 we've
 done
 on
 this
 the
 more
 we're


kind
 of
 convinced
 that
 the
 capital


spending
 boom
 we're
 seeing
 due
 to
 tech


and
 and
 specifically
 AI
 is
 is
 looking


very
 much
 akin
 to
 the
 global
 internet


buildout,
 networking
 buildout
 in
 the


late
 90s.
 And
 the
 problem
 there
 of


course
 is
 is
 that


if
 you
 buy
 my
 chips
 from
 Nvidia
 or
 you


were
 buying
 my
 networking
 equipment
 at


Cisco
 and
 Lucent,
 that's
 revenue
 for
 me


and
 profit,
 but
 for
 you
 it's
 capitalized


expense,
 right?
 It's
 written
 off
 over


time
 and
 that
 has
 a
 big
 big
 boost
 until


people
 pull
 their
 orders
 and
 that's
 what


we
 saw
 in
 2001
 2002
 that
 GDP
 dropped


about
 1
 to
 2%
 in
 the
 recession
 of
 0102.


Does
 anybody
 know
 what
 corporate
 profits


did
 in
 that
 and
 that
 was
 an
 investment


driven
 recession.
 Consumers
 didn't
 feel


it
 at
 all.
 earnings
 were
 down
 about
 45%


I
 think
 from
 peak
 to
 trough
 in
 the
 S&P


they
 were
 down
 about
 the
 same
 a
 little


bit
 more
 in
 the
 global
 financial
 crisis


but
 of
 course
 GDP
 collapsed
 so
 here's
 a


little
 interesting
 thought
 experiment


right
 now
 um
 Nvidia's


uh
 revenues
 are
 about
 1
 half
 of
 1%
 of
 US


GDP
 about
 $140
 billion
 and
 our
 GDP
 is


about
 29
 trillion
 okay
 anyone
 Tell
 me


what
 Cisco
 and
 Lucent,
 the
 two
 companies


that
 you
 needed
 when
 building
 out
 your


internet
 network
 in
 99200.
 Did
 anybody


know
 what
 their
 combined
 revenues
 as
 a


percent
 of
 GDP
 was
 in
 2000?


No
 using
 your
 phones
 and
 Chad
 GP.
 It
 was


a
 half
 a
 percent.
 It
 was
 uh
 it
 was


roughly
 $50
 billion
 total
 on
 GDP
 of
 10


trillion.


So
 those
 revenues
 stopped
 growing
 at
 at


at
 some
 point
 shortly
 thereafter
 and


actually
 shrunk
 a
 little
 bit.
 So
 the


investment
 boom
 we're
 seeing
 right
 now


we've
 seen
 before
 and
 it's
 not
 just


chips,
 right?
 It's
 Caterpillar.
 It's


people
 building
 the
 data
 centers.
 It's


it's
 people
 building
 new
 utilities.
 I


mean
 it's
 there
 is
 a
 ecosystem
 around


the
 AI
 uh
 boom
 that
 is
 considerable
 as


there
 was
 for
 TMT
 back
 in
 99
 and
 2000


but
 it
 is
 a
 riskier
 revenue
 stream


because
 if
 people
 pull
 back
 they
 can


pull
 back
 capex
 very
 easily.
 projects


can
 get
 put
 on
 hold
 for
 six
 months
 or


nine
 months
 and
 and
 that
 immediately


shows
 up
 in
 disappointing
 revenues
 and


earnings
 forecast
 if
 it
 happens.
 We're


not
 there
 yet,
 but
 that's
 one
 of the


risks
 out
 there
 that
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 underestimating.
 So,
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 that
 um
 we
 like
 talking
 to


you
 and
 a
 consistent
 thing
 that
 I've


noticed
 in
 the
 almost
 10
 years
 of
 doing


this
 podcast,
 it's
 always
 uh
 you
 learn
 a


lot
 talking
 to
 people
 who
 are
 really


steeped
 in
 accounting
 and
 that
 people


who
 uh
 are
 knowledgeable
 about


accounting
 just
 I
 don't
 know
 they
 seem


to
 be
 have
 more
 interesting
 things
 to


say
 than
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 people.
 Will
 AI


be
 able
 to
 do
 accounting
 some
 of
 these


sort
 of
 understandings
 of
 you
 know


whatever
 capitalized
 expenses
 and


different
 like
 is
 this
 coming
 for
 the


accounting
 profession
 about
 coming
 for


the
 accounting
 profession
 that's
 a
 good


question
 I
 think
 that
 AI
 that
 that
 we've


seen
 and
 used
 is
 getting
 better
 and


better
 pulling
 numbers
 together
 and


making
 sense
 of
 them
 it's
 not
 quite


there
 yet
 when
 I've
 done
 it
 I
 find
 lots


and
 lots
 of
 errors
 not
 so
 much
 in
 the


numbers
 themselves
 but
 the
 implications


of
 the
 numbers
 the
 AI
 is
 still
 not


getting
 that
 great
 but
 it's
 going
 to
 I


think
 ultimately
 and
 the
 question
 will


be
 for
 sort
 of
 tonight's
 conversation


and
 keeping
 in
 the
 theme
 is


where
 we
 made
 a
 lot of
 money
 on
 the


short
 side
 idiosyncratically
 after


dotcom
 from
 sort
 of
 03
 to09
 were
 in


analog
 businesses
 that
 saw
 their


business
 digitize.


So
 if
 you
 were
 selling
 an
 analog
 product


that
 that
 became
 digital
 you
 were
 in
 a


lot
 of
 trouble.
 think
 like
 Kodak,
 okay,


or
 Blockbuster,
 Yellow
 Pages,
 those


kinds
 of
 businesses,
 right?
 That


suddenly
 just
 didn't
 have
 to
 exist.
 And


there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 raft
 of
 them
 post


AI
 and
 people
 are
 already
 kind
 of


starting
 to
 think
 that
 through.
 But


there
 will
 be
 industries
 that
 are


collecting
 what
 I
 call
 agency
 rents
 that


will
 suddenly
 not
 be
 able
 to
 collect


those
 agency
 rents.
 And
 um
 we're
 trying


to
 keep
 an
 eye
 on
 that.
 But
 I
 do
 think


that
 that
 the
 issue
 isn't
 so
 much
 the


quantitative
 numbers
 that
 AI
 will
 be


able
 to
 generate
 and
 give
 you
 ratios
 and


things
 like
 that,
 although
 Bloomberg


does
 a
 pretty
 good
 job
 of
 that
 already,


right?
 I
 mean,
 databases.
 Um,
 but


interpreting
 it
 and
 we're
 not
 there
 yet


in
 terms
 of
 understanding


what
 an
 increase
 in
 receivables
 are.


It's
 three
 times
 revenues
 or
 in
 increase


in
 cost
 of
 goods
 sold
 relative
 to


inventory.
 But
 it'll
 get
 there.
 it'll


get
 there
 within
 the
 next
 couple
 years.


So,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 always
 wanted
 to


ask
 you
 was
 how
 you
 think
 about,
 I


guess,
 the
 time
 frames
 of
 some
 of
 your


short
 bets
 because
 it
 seems
 to
 me
 like,


you
 know,
 we
 can
 sit
 here
 and
 talk
 about


how
 crazy
 cap
 rates
 are
 for
 office


buildings
 in
 New
 York
 and
 subprime
 loans


and
 Carvana
 and
 how
 stupid
 Bitcoin


treasury
 companies
 are.
 Declining
 car


sales
 at
 Tesla.
 That's
 right.
 And
 yet,


you
 know,
 it
 the
 key
 to
 all
 of
 this,
 to


making
 the
 money
 on
 it,
 is
 actually


calling
 what
 the
 catalyst
 is
 going
 to
 be


and
 when
 the
 stock
 eventually
 falls.


Yeah.
 I
 I've
 after
 40
 years,
 I've
 kind


of
 figured
 out
 that
 the
 catalysts
 are


really
 evident
 pretty
 much
 in
 hindsight.


Um


that
 that
 if
 if
 the
 catalysts
 were
 that


obvious,
 it
 would
 be
 priced
 into
 the


stock.
 And
 so,
 you
 can
 look
 for


signposts
 along
 the
 world,
 but
 but


they're
 just
 that.
 Now,
 there's
 some


that
 are
 better
 than
 others.
 you
 know,
 a


massive
 increase
 in
 insider
 selling
 and


executives
 leaving
 has
 always
 been
 a


good
 one
 for
 the
 most
 part.
 It's
 it's


probabilistic,
 but
 I
 think
 that
 timing


is,
 you
 know,
 I
 always
 like
 say,
 you


know,
 only
 short
 the
 stocks
 that
 go


down.
 If
 they
 don't
 go
 down,
 don't
 short


them.
 Um,
 and
 and
 it's
 hard.
 And
 it's


why
 being
 hedged
 pretty
 much


systematically
 to
 us
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 sense


for
 the
 last
 30
 years.
 um
 and
 say,


"Okay,
 we're
 going
 to
 take
 the
 market


out
 of
 what
 we're
 doing
 and
 we're
 going


to
 just
 try
 to
 isolate
 the
 the


idiosyncratic
 attributes
 of
 our
 shorts."


And
 even
 then,
 I
 mean,
 stuff
 you
 would


think
 would
 bring
 a
 lower
 valuation
 out


of
 common
 sense,
 you
 know,
 doesn't


happen
 in
 in
 a
 bullion
 bull
 markets
 and


in
 fact
 can
 be
 a
 negative
 factor.
 You


know,
 the
 worse
 the
 company,
 the
 the


more
 it
 goes
 up.
 So,
 you
 have
 to
 be


willing
 to
 understand
 that
 concept
 as


well.
 But
 again,
 it's
 it's
 it's
 funny,


you
 know,
 Equinex
 coming
 out
 of
 the


blue,
 just
 to
 use
 the
 example
 we've
 had


tonight
 and
 stock
 down
 20%
 in
 two
 days.


I
 mean,
 everything
 it
 said
 at
 analyst


day
 was
 known
 to
 anybody
 was
 paying


attention,
 but
 yet
 they
 came
 out
 and


said
 it
 and
 everybody
 went,
 "Oh,
 wow.


Ouch."
 Speaking
 of
 executive
 departures,


I
 think
 there
 was
 another
 one
 today
 at


Tesla,
 someone
 who
 was
 like,
 I
 think


pretty
 close
 to
 Elon
 or
 someone
 who
 had


been
 there
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 Do
 you
 have


a
 um
 Nobody
 cares.
 Nobody
 cares.
 Do
 Do


you
 have
 a
 Tesla
 thought
 of
 the
 day?


Nobody
 cares.
 That's
 my
 thought.
 Nobody


cares.
 Yeah.
 You
 You
 could,
 you
 know,


you
 could
 see
 Elon,
 you
 know,
 robbing
 a


Brinks
 truck
 with
 a
 mask
 on,
 whatever.


Oh,
 that's
 Elon.
 You
 know,


I'm
 sure
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 new


business
 of
 robbing
 Brinks
 trucks
 and,


you
 know,
 we'll
 put
 a
 we'll
 put
 a


trillion
 valuation
 on.
 I
 I've
 given
 up


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 people
 think


about
 about
 executive
 departures
 at
 that


company.
 I
 mean
 their
 car
 sales
 are


plummeting,
 their
 cash
 flow
 is


plummeting,
 you
 know,
 all
 the
 metrics


that
 you
 would
 look
 as
 security


analysts,
 but
 it's
 a
 unique
 animal
 where


people
 will
 say,
 "Oh,
 well,
 of
 course,


yes,
 but
 you
 know,
 Rosie
 the
 robot's


going
 to
 serve
 me
 my
 breakfast
 and
 it's


going
 to
 have
 Tesla
 trademark
 on
 it,
 so


you
 know,
 it's
 worth
 a
 trillion


dollars."
 So
 there's
 always
 one
 stock
 in


every
 bull
 market
 that
 has
 that
 at
 least


that
 impremature
 of
 right
 of
 of
 a
 I
 call


it
 a
 hopes
 and
 dreams.
 Everyone
 can
 can


really
 project
 their
 hopes
 and
 dreams


onto
