From
 the
 New
 [music]
 York
 Times,
 it's


the
 headlines.

Today's
 Monday,
 January
 5th.

Here's
 what
 we're
 covering.


At
 noon
 today,
 Nicholas
 Maduro
 and
 his


wife
 will
 appear
 in
 a
 lower
 Manhattan


courtroom
 less
 than
 72
 hours
 after
 the


Venezuelan
 leader
 was
 seized
 in
 a


shocking
 raid
 by
 US
 special
 forces.


They're
 expected
 to
 plead
 not
 guilty
 to


charges
 of
 drug
 trafficking,
 conspiracy,


and
 other
 crimes.
 It's
 the
 start
 of
 what


will
 almost
 certainly
 be
 a
 years'slong


prosecution
 that
 could
 lead
 to
 Maduro


being
 imprisoned
 for
 life
 in
 the
 US.


>> Don't
 ask
 me
 who's
 in
 charge
 because


I'll
 give
 you
 an
 answer
 and
 it'll
 be


very
 controversial.


>> What
 does
 that
 mean?


>> It
 means
 we're
 in
 charge.
 As
 Maduro
 sits


in
 an
 American
 jail
 cell,
 President


Trump
 and
 his
 administration
 have
 been


doubling
 down
 on
 their
 assertion
 that


the
 US
 will
 direct
 Venezuela's
 future.


>> So,
 is
 is
 the
 United
 States
 running


Venezuela
 right
 now?


>> What
 we
 are
 running
 is
 the
 direction


that
 this
 is
 going
 to
 move
 moving


forward
 and
 that
 is
 we
 have
 leverage.


This
 leverage
 we
 are
 using
 and
 we
 intend


to
 use.
 we
 started
 using.


>> In
 interviews
 over
 the
 weekend,


Secretary
 of
 State
 Marco
 Rubio
 said
 the


US
 will
 keep
 what
 he
 called
 a
 military


quarantine
 in
 place
 on
 Venezuela's
 oil


exports
 in
 order
 to
 pressure
 the


country.


>> We
 care
 about
 Venezuela.
 We
 want
 it
 to


do
 well
 moving
 forward,
 but
 our
 number


one
 objective
 here
 is
 America.
 No
 more


drugs,
 no
 more
 drug,
 no
 more
 trained


outwa
 gangs
 coming
 our
 direction.


>> Rubio
 said
 the
 administration
 has
 also


not
 ruled
 out
 putting
 US
 troops
 on
 the


ground
 there.
 Venezuela
 is
 now
 formally


being
 led
 by
 Maduro's
 vice
 president,


Deli
 Rodriguez,
 who
 was
 sworn
 in
 on


Saturday.
 While
 she
 initially
 denounced


the
 US
 raid,
 she
 struck
 a
 more


diplomatic
 tone
 last
 night,
 saying
 in
 a


statement,
 "Our
 people
 in
 our
 region


deserve
 peace
 and
 dialogue,
 not
 war."


Trump
 has
 explicitly
 threatened
 her,


saying
 that
 if
 she
 doesn't
 quote
 do


what's
 right,
 she
 is
 going
 to
 pay
 a
 very


big
 price,
 probably
 bigger
 than
 Maduro.


For
 now,
 the
 Trump
 administration
 seems


focused
 on
 securing
 Venezuela's
 oil.
 It


has
 more
 oil
 than
 any
 other
 country
 in


the
 world,
 but
 it
 has
 struggled
 to
 get


it
 out
 of
 the
 ground
 and
 currently


produces
 only
 about
 1%
 of
 the
 global


total,
 which
 it
 has
 sold
 mostly
 to


China.
 The
 White
 House
 appears
 set
 to


force
 Rodriguez
 to
 allow
 American
 oil


companies
 to
 [music]
 invest
 and
 operate


in
 the
 country
 under
 favorable


conditions.
 Though
 experts
 say
 that


[music]
 transforming
 Venezuela's
 oil


industry,
 would
 be
 a
 yearslong


multi-billion
 dollar
 effort.
 [music]


Meanwhile,
 the
 raid
 on
 Venezuela,
 which


killed
 at
 least
 80
 people,
 including


civilians,
 has
 drawn
 both
 celebration


and
 sharp
 criticism
 in
 the
 region.
 To


many
 conservatives
 in
 Latin
 America,
 the


American
 military
 operation
 rescued


Venezuela
 from
 a
 dictatorship.
 To
 many


on
 the
 left,
 however,
 it
 was
 a
 sign
 that


the
 US
 is
 willing
 to
 invade
 its
 southern


neighbors
 for
 its
 own
 gain.
 Brazil,


Mexico,
 Colombia,
 Chile,
 and
 Uruguay


denounced
 the
 strike
 in
 a
 joint


statement
 as
 a
 quote
 extremely
 dangerous


president.
 Beyond
 that,
 the
 United


Nations
 Security
 Council
 is
 said
 to
 have


an
 emergency
 meeting
 today
 to
 discuss


the
 situation.
 Trump
 has
 already


suggested
 that
 the
 US
 could
 take
 action


against
 other
 countries
 next,
 including


Colombia
 and
 Mexico.


Today
 on
 the
 Daily,
 a
 closer
 look
 at
 the


legal
 [music]
 questions
 surrounding
 the


US
 raid
 and
 how
 the
 Trump
 administration


is
 justifying
 the
 capture
 of
 Maduro.


In
 Switzerland,
 managers
 of
 the
 bar


where
 at least
 40
 people
 died
 in
 a
 New


Year's
 Eve
 blaze
 have
 been
 placed
 under


criminal
 investigation
 for
 allegations


of
 negligence.
 Investigators
 said


yesterday
 they
 believe
 the
 fire
 was


caused
 by
 small
 fireworks
 in
 the
 bar's


basement.
 Photos
 and
 video
 show


sparklers
 attached
 to
 champagne
 bottles


being
 held
 in
 the
 air,
 igniting
 foam


insulation
 covering
 the
 ceiling.


Survivors
 told
 the
 Times
 the
 flames


spread
 quickly
 as
 people
 rushed
 for
 the


exit
 in
 a
 sea
 of
 bodies.
 Officials
 are


looking
 at
 how
 a
 narrow
 staircase
 out


became
 a
 choke
 point.
 Many
 of
 those


killed
 were
 teenagers
 or
 in
 their
 early


20s.
 The
 youngest
 was
 14.
 In
 addition,


more
 than
 a
 100
 people
 were
 injured
 with


dozens
 who
 were
 critically
 burned
 flown


to
 hospitals
 across
 Switzerland
 and
 to


France
 and
 Italy.
 Fire
 safety
 experts


say
 the
 available
 evidence
 of
 a
 crowded


exit,
 fireworks,
 and
 flammable
 foam


suggests
 the
 tragedy
 was
 avoidable.
 They


said
 it
 appeared
 to
 involve
 the
 same


kinds
 of
 safety
 lapses
 that
 caused
 other


lethal
 blazes
 in
 crowded
 venues,
 like


the
 2003
 blaze
 in
 a
 Rhode
 Island


nightclub
 that
 killed
 roughly
 100


people,
 and
 a
 2013
 fire
 in
 Brazil
 that


killed
 more
 than
 200.

When
 it
 comes
 to
 vaccines,
 public
 health


experts
 are
 clear
 about
 the
 benefit.
 You


take
 the
 shingles
 vaccine
 to
 avoid
 a


painful
 bout
 of
 shingles.
 You
 take
 the


RSV
 vaccine
 to
 avoid
 getting


hospitalized
 with
 a
 respiratory


infection.
 The
 flu
 shot,
 same
 thing.
 But


for
 older
 people,
 studies
 show
 there's
 a


growing
 list
 of
 other
 upsides
 to
 the


shots.
 They're
 called
 offtarget


benefits,
 meaning
 the
 vaccinations
 do


good
 things
 beyond
 preventing
 the


illness
 that
 they're
 intended
 to
 head


off.
 One
 recent
 analysis
 found
 reduced


risks
 of
 dementia
 after
 some


vaccinations.
 Getting
 the
 flu
 shot
 in


particular
 has
 been
 associated
 with


lower
 risks
 of
 heart
 attack
 and
 stroke.


And
 some
 researchers
 are
 even


investigating
 the
 effects
 of
 the
 COVID


vaccine
 on
 cancer
 survival.
 Most


hypotheses
 about
 why
 there
 may
 be


offtarget
 benefits
 center
 on


inflammation.
 Inflammation
 happens
 when


you're
 fighting
 an
 infection
 and
 it
 can


damage
 or
 stress
 your
 body.
 If
 you're


not
 fighting
 off
 as
 many
 diseases,
 you


may
 have
 less
 fallout
 from
 inflammation.


There
 is
 a
 caveat
 to
 all
 of
 this


research
 and
 that
 is
 that
 most
 of
 the


studies
 are
 subject
 to
 healthy
 volunteer


bias.
 Basically,
 vaccinated
 patients
 may


also
 practice
 other
 healthy
 habits
 that


set
 them
 apart
 from
 those
 who
 don't
 get


the
 shots.


Currently,
 many
 older
 Americans
 have
 not


gotten
 updated
 vaccinations.
 Data
 from


the
 CDC
 shows
 that
 as
 of
 last
 month,


[music]
 only
 about
 60%
 of
 older
 adults


have
 gotten
 a
 flu
 shot,
 and
 less
 than
 a


third
 have
 gotten
 the
 most
 recent
 COVID


vaccine.


[music]


And
 finally,
 if
 the
 major
 players
 in
 the


artificial
 intelligence
 boom
 are
 right,


years
 from
 now,
 you
 could
 find
 yourself


looking
 up
 at
 the
 night
 sky
 to
 see
 a


data
 center
 floating
 up
 there,
 shining


like
 a
 planet.
 The
 idea
 comes
 from
 some


tech
 leaders
 concern
 that
 Earth
 might


just
 not
 be
 big
 enough
 to
 house
 all
 the


data
 centers
 that
 the
 industry
 is
 going


to
 need.
 As
 AI
 has
 taken
 off,
 there's


been
 a
 huge
 construction
 boom
 on
 the


infrastructure
 to
 support
 it.
 But
 there


have
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 limitations,
 too.
 In


some
 locations,
 there
 may
 not
 be
 enough


power
 for
 the
 centers.
 In
 others,
 nearby


residents
 have
 raised
 concerns
 that


they're
 driving
 up
 utility
 bills
 or


worsening
 water
 shortages.
 All
 of
 that


has
 some
 companies
 trying
 to
 get


creative.
 Google
 is
 supposed
 to
 have


test
 launches
 on
 a
 space
 data
 center


project
 next
 year.
 You
 actually
 don't


need
 batteries
 cuz
 it's
 always
 sunny
 in


space.


>> And
 the
 biggest
 names
 in
 the
 field
 have


pledged
 support
 for
 the
 idea.
 Elon
 Musk,


Jeff
 Bezos,
 Jensen
 Wong.


>> That's
 the
 dream.


>> Yes,
 that's
 the
 dream,


>> right?


>> But
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 skeptics
 who
 say


these
 grand
 plans
 aren't
 that
 feasible,


at least
 not
 on
 a
 quick
 timeline.
 The


costs
 right
 now
 are
 huge.
 And
 there
 is
 a


lot
 about
 space
 like
 the
 radiation
 and


the
 extreme
 cold
 at
 minus455°


F
 that
 scientists
 still
 have
 to
 solve


for.
 One
 former
 SpaceX
 executive
 told


the
 Times,
 "The
 excitement
 is
 very
 of


the
 moment,
 saying,
 quote,
 "The
 hottest


thing
 to
 invest
 in
 right
 now
 is
 AI,


[music]
 and
 the
 second
 hottest
 thing
 is


space.
 Now
 they're
 converging.


Those


are
 the
 headlines.
