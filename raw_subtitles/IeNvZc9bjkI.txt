>> It's hard to believe the
year is almost over and what a
year it's been.
Feels like we've had
enough news to fill a decade
and live through so many
elections and so many
challenges from south of the
border.
So what stands out?
What events from 2025 ended up
having the most impact?
We take a look at the year
that was and the political
developments that shaped it
nationally and right here
in Ontario.
Then many think the life
of a foreign correspondent
is pretty glamorous.
And sure, it can be
full of adventure, but it can
also take a major toll.
What is it like
reporting on conflicts
and bearing witness to human
suffering?
This is The Rundown.
A lot has happened this year
politically in Ontario and
across the country.
Listing the major events just
here in this province could
take us a whole other year.
So let's cut through
the noise and focus on
some highlights and lowlights.
I sat down with Tonda Morales,
bureau chief and senior
reporter in the Toronto Star's
Ottawa bureau, and John Michael
McGrath, TVO Today columnist
and co-host of the OnPoli
podcast, to talk about the
biggest moments of 2025.
Tonda, John Michael McGrath,
welcome to the program.
Great.
You guys can be here.
I'm going to start with you.
What event had a bigger impact
on the course of this year's
political landscape?
Is it Justin Trudeau's
resignation or Trump's
announcement on tariffs?
>> Well, I think Trump's
announcement on tariffs.
But in a way
that was the backdrop for
Justin Trudeau's resignation,
because it was also the
backdrop for when Chrystia
Freeland resigned.
You recall saying that
the liberals didn't have
a plan to deal with the
coming tariffs.
But Trump's tariffs
have affected globally.
Everybody upended global trade
economics, security, security
discussions, everything.
It's it's it is a seismic
change in the way the the
world is working together.
So I mean as one
single event that's it.
But as a big political event
in the Canadian calendar,
Justin Trudeau's resignation
was huge.
>> JMM, same question to you.
It's hard to look back.
It's been 12 months.
But yeah.
>> I mean, if I had a time
machine and I could rerun this
past year, this is the question
I most want to see answered,
which is, you know, if Justin
Trudeau had stayed on as prime
minister and could run for
re-election in the context of
the Trump tariffs, which
obviously played so heavily
into Mark Carney's federal
campaign about, you know,
elbows up and all of the
messaging around protecting
Canadian jobs and protecting
the Canadian economy.
You know, could Justin Trudeau
still be prime minister today?
I I'm sceptical,
but it's just such a
fascinating historical question
that I would love to know.
Like Tonda, I think you
have to say that
just globally speaking,
Donald Trump's presidency has
been the bigger, bigger issue.
And in the even in the context
of Canadian politics.
And obviously, I could talk
a bit more about the effect
it's had in Ontario.
The tariffs really
have just been so huge.
>> I want to pick up on what
you said, Justin Trudeau's
resignation.
Why was it so big for us here?
>> Because right up until a
couple of days before he made
the decision, he resigned on
January 6th.
Maybe people will recall.
But right up until the very end,
he tried to tough it out.
After Freeland's resignation,
the resignation of his
finance minister on a budget day
or a fiscal economic update day.
Big deal.
And spent the whole of
Christmas holidays huddling with
advisors and talking to caucus.
And so really,
when he took the decision
to get out, it put
everything in play.
It brought in Mark Carney
into Canadian politics.
It suddenly challenged
the conservatives to deal with
a new Liberal leader
who was putting attempting to
put a new brand and face on the
Liberal Party, which had had a
decade in power.
And, you know, it really
challenged the conservatives
in the last campaign
to confront that reality.
Mr. Poilievre continued
to campaign against
Justin Trudeau, and arguably
some days he still does.
Throughout that campaign,
and many felt that he never did
make the pivot to deal with the
American threat the way the
liberals did via the selection
of Mark Carney as their leader.
>> John Mikal, let's talk
provincial politics, captain
Canada I know that's what we
were talking provincial
politics here.
I don't have any props
or any hats that say Canada's
for sale here.
>> But foam glove with the
finger.
>> Exactly.
But what effect did
that nickname have on Doug Ford
during his campaign?
>> Well, you know, Tonda
mentioned the inability or
unwillingness by Pierre
Poilievre to pivot to reflect
the changing political
circumstances.
And, you know, as a columnist,
sometimes you get things wrong.
Sometimes you make predictions
that don't pan out.
And if I can be allowed a
very small victory lap, I was
pretty early on in calling that
the moment Donald Trump won the
election, that Doug Ford would
have grounds to call an early
Ontario election.
Of course, there had been
speculation that
there would be an early
election for months before that.
And the big question was, you
know, what would the what would
the excuse for an early
election be?
And the moment Trump's election
was was final.
And, you know, we knew that
tariffs were coming.
It was clear to me
that we would be
that was going to be the
grounds for a new election.
And and sure enough,
that's what it was.
You know, it really cannot
overstate what a seismic shift
the tariffs are to Canadian
policymakers.
We really have spent
a generation just assuming
that the American market
would always be open to us
under the most favourable terms.
And the change since
January 20th, perhaps it should
not have taken policymakers by
surprise the way it did.
I think there was a lot of
sort of wishful thinking
that somehow Trump didn't really
mean us when he talked about
tariffs on everybody, but he
did.
He meant us as well as
everybody else.
And everything
since then has just been a form
of adjusting, and that has been
part of what worked so well for
Doug Ford in that election
campaign was really, you know,
pivoting away from, frankly,
almost anything except talking
about protecting the Ontario
economy and protecting Ontario
jobs.
>> All right, Tom.
>> So I would just say he also
did so by seizing the moment in
a visceral, emotional way.
He appealed to Ontario voters
as a defender on an emotional
level in a way that neither,
frankly, Mark Carney nor
Pierre Poilievre did
or still are able to capture,
sort of the, the, the,
the reactions of Canadians
in the face of the Trump
threats of 51st state and the
defensive posture that
Canadians adopted to, you know,
stop travelling to the US for
pleasure and stop buying
American made products and go
for Buy Canadian.
I mean, that was Doug Ford,
I think gave voice to that
even with the ad that later
so angered Donald Trump
into ceasing trade negotiations
with this country.
Doug Ford's government, Doug
Ford himself, captured both on
an emotional level and in a way,
on an intellectual level, the
anti-tariff argument and put it
back in the face of Americans.
Remember how mad they got when
he threatened to cut off
electricity?
Ontario electric
electrical exports?
So I think that was the secret
of some of his success.
And let's face it,
ever since he's been Prime
Minister, Mark Carney is quite
happy to have Doug Ford play
that role.
>> Well, let's stick with that,
Tom.
Let's throw these two in a
room together.
We've got Premier Doug Ford,
Prime Minister Mark Carney.
What do you make of
their relationship?
>> I mean, they've got a good
relationship.
There's no question there is.
There was a source of
tension around the ad
because the Canadians on the
federal side were acutely aware
that it was angering Trump and
angering the US ambassador here
and angering some of the
Republicans in the US.
But I think that aside from
that tension, by and large,
these two get along.
There's barely a
federal policy that comes out
that Doug Ford doesn't come out
in public and defend.
You know,
he has backed Mark Carney on
major projects.
He has backed Mark Carney
largely on his approach
to tariffs.
When Mark Carney rolled back
Canada's counter-tariffs on
the US and rolled back
the digital services tax
in an effort to, you know,
woo Trump, Ford was with him
every step of the way
praising his efforts.
And look, they do have
a good relationship.
They talk frequently.
And I think that's,
you know, a bit of a success
for both of them.
You know, the good cop/bad cop
playbook is working for them.
>> Well, I want to pick up on
that as well.
I should mention that
Premier Ford said that
Carney knew about the ad,
allegedly, that Tonya had
mentioned how much of this is a
good cop/bad cop strategy here.
>> I'm not sure how much of it
is premeditated in that sense,
of the idea of them playing
those those roles consciously,
but they seem to have, at the
very least, organically.
They have arrived at this game
where, you know,
Ford stakes out a bit more
of an antagonistic,
aggressive position, and then
Carney can be the relatively
more conciliatory one.
You know, it's fair to say
that this act has not
worked perfectly right.
Like we don't have a deal with
the Americans right now, and I
don't know of anybody who would
confidently say that there is a
deal within sight.
But obviously I don't place
all of the blame for that
on Canadian policymakers.
The primary actor here
is Donald Trump and his
administration's refusal
to to make a deal.
You know, the other point
I would make is that I think
Ford has been very, very
active in a way that I think
might have surprised people,
maybe not not always familiar
with this, you know,
just how many levers there are
at the provincial level to make
international political moves.
Right.
You know, Todd to mentioned
threatening electricity exports,
which Ontario can do
because Ontario owns most of
its own electricity system
and it certainly regulates
electricity sales here.
Right.
Things like pulling American
liquor out of the LCBO shelves
because Ontario has a
provincially run
liquor monopoly.
You know, there are all of
these pressure points
that the provincial government
can, can, can push
on when it wants to make a
point to Americans, you know,
and like the fact that both of
Kentucky's senators have been
very vocal about how American
tariffs are hurting Kentucky
bourbon exporters, because
Ontario is the LCBO is one of
the single largest liquor
buyers in the world.
And at the moment,
you can't sell Kentucky bourbon
here in Ontario.
>> I want to stick on energy,
but I want to talk nation
building projects.
The Darlington Small Modular
Reactor is a project
that's on the fast track list.
This is just east of Oshawa.
Significant.
Explain.
>> So this has been a project
that has been underway for
actually a very long time.
If you want to go back to
the earliest incarnation of
Ontario's power company,
OPG first applied for an
environmental assessment at
the Darlington site back under
the McGuinty government.
And they got that assessment.
And even after that
generation of nuclear proposal
was scrapped,
OPG wisely kept the
environmental assessment alive.
And in the last decade, as as
the idea of small modular
reactors, these are generally
smaller, as the name implies,
smaller nuclear reactors that
the hope is will be faster and
cheaper to build, as that has
become sort of the the hot
topic in nuclear policy.
Ontario was able to go to
global companies and say, hey,
we've got this site ready to go,
ready to build with an existing
environmental approval.
We can just get going.
Now.
The significance of Mark Carney
putting the Darlington SMR site
on the the major projects list.
It's not entirely clear to me
because as I sort of already
said, it already has all of its
federal approvals.
Now, there are other things
that the federal government
can do to support it,
like make money available,
which they've promised.
But I think the harmony
that we're now seeing
between the provincial and the
federal government on nuclear
power is probably a
foreshadowing of things to come,
because the Ontario is not
stopping with the Darlington
site.
They this year began with
the provincial government
announcing a massive new
nuclear station that they want
to build in port Hope, just a
bit further east of Darlington.
And that is only one of several
locations they're talking about.
So one of the sleeper stories
this year, so to speak, has
been Ontario really going even
more enthusiastically into
nuclear power.
And they will need federal help
to to execute that.
>> I want to pick up on I think.
>> Yeah, I think I was just
going to say that the I think
the reason we see a project
like that, which you're right,
had so many approvals already
in place, is less about, you
know, what the federal
government can actually do for
that one particular project.
But in the early days when this
whole list, the first phase of
projects that Mark Carney put
on the on the table for
potential designation as nation
building, I think this was part
of a greater signal to the
country that the emphasis for
major projects and fast tracked
approvals is going to be on
mines, critical minerals,
energy, clean energy and other
related trade boosting
infrastructure like ports and
rail and say the Port of
Churchill, the Port of Montreal.
These are, you know, they're in
different phases.
Phase one,
phase two.
But none of them have actually
so far gotten the title of
nation in the national interest
or been fast tracked.
But there was a very clear
signal to markets.
Look, you didn't see on that
list a family doctor
for every Canadian
as a nation building project,
you didn't see Pharmacare
as a nation building project.
You don't see.
It was also interesting.
They put on things like
high speed rail for Ontario.
Right.
So that is also a project
that the proponents
are saying we're already seeing
benefits, even if we haven't
been put into the process for
fast track approvals yet.
They are already seeing
the benefit of going out to
persuade investors to
pour capital into the project.
They're saying, look,
this is a real thing.
So I think that was a large
part of what Carney is doing.
He's got a very clear vision for
what he wants to get priority.
And it's all around trade,
economy and potentially clean
energy.
Although it might not.
It doesn't sound like that,
I suppose, because now we're
also talking about pipelines.
>> Well, let's let's follow up
on that.
Carney most recently
signed the memorandum of
understanding with Alberta, and
he explained his his approach
as cooperative federalism.
And I'm curious to know
how much of that approach
would will bode well
for other provinces.
>> I mean, that's a signal that
he's trying to honour a
constitutional principle around
the division of powers, and he
wants to engage provinces on
their areas of jurisdiction.
It's a bit of a it's a bit of a
cliche in a way.
But he's he's preaching
to the converted.
I mean, Alberta wants to operate
in its own areas of
jurisdiction.
What it does, though, signal,
is that Carney is willing to
cut deals with provinces
as long as everybody's
aligned on the same goal.
So, for example, he part
of the agreement with Alberta,
if they were to ever approve a
pipeline, would be tougher
industrial carbon pricing on
Alberta's part on their own
emitters.
And the feds would agree to
lift, for example, the
Clean Electricity Regulations,
which are sort of aimed at
making natural gas powered
plants sort of less and less
the the norm and or requiring
them to pay for emissions.
The feds are prepared to
lift that.
Doug Ford wants that.
Ontario wants that.
You know, it's I think what
you saw is Carney
signalling to provinces.
Then show me not the money,
but show me the way.
You're going to decarbonise.
Show me the way
you're going to get to net zero.
Show me how you're going to cut
your emissions, and we'll cut
these kinds of deals.
>> All right.
I've got 10 seconds each
for our last question here.
It's been a long year.
Given all that's happened,
what can we expect next year?
>> In terms of Ontario politics?
I think the big fight that is
coming is over the fate of
school boards and elected
trustees.
We don't know yet
which way the government is
going to go, but that will be
a big, loud fight.
>> Tom, do you get the last
word?
>> 10 seconds: Energy, politics
and a potential election.
Again, I hate to break
the news to you,
but we may be in another
federal election campaign
next year.
>> Here we go.
All right, Tonda,
really appreciate John Michael
McGrath.
Always a pleasure.
Thank you so much.
More than 40 years ago,
Brian Stewart became
a foreign correspondent.
He reported on the Gulf War.
He brought global awareness to
the Ethiopian famine in 1984.
He interviewed heads of state
and everyday people affected
by historic crises.
Here's part of our conversation
about his new book,
On the Ground: My Life as
a Foreign Correspondent, and
how world changing events
changed him to.
Brian, thank you so much for
having us in your lovely home.
How are you doing?
>> Oh, great.
Thank you and my pleasure
to have you here.
>> All right.
You have covered a lot.
Ethiopian famine.
You were in El Salvador.
You were in Kuwait, Lebanon,
covering pretty much
the entire Cold War.
I imagine as a journalist, you
are pushing through, seeing
some of the worst things
possible.
What kept you going?
>> Well, I think it was the
obligation of the craft, being
a journalist, being a foreign
correspondent, which is what I
dreamt of, and knowing there
was a risk reward involved in
that work, that it was
sometimes risky.
I didn't realise
just how much the
emotional suffering could be.
And I think certainly covering
the Ethiopian famine in 1984
and 85 and for often weeks and
months on end, it did really
cause major strain on all of us
who were involved in that
coverage.
And we saw things we
couldn't really have even
prepared for.
I thought I could
prepare for everything.
When I arrived in Ethiopia
in 1984 and northern part of
the country hit by famine,
it was just beyond imagining.
It was like apocalypse,
a world after a
nuclear holocaust.
The dust clouds across the
horizon, the bodies along the
streets, as I think I reported.
>> Famine is along each road
and at the gates of every town
by the hundreds of thousands.
Peasants are fleeing the worst
drought in memory.
>> What kept you going was the
feeling that, you know, this
was hidden from the world.
We were there because
we fought our way in
with the BBC to get visas.
We were the only two crews
in the whole famine area,
and we needed to alert the
world.
And that's what kept us going.
And afterwards other things
kept us going, like a desire
to see the famine ended
and the desire to see that
society recover from famine.
>> Tell me about one particular
person that is still someone
that you keep in touch with,
that you met in Ethiopia, that
people really connect with in
terms of your story and your
coverage?
>> Yeah.
Her name is Birhan Woldu,
and I saw her first when
she was three and a half years
old.
I was at a feeding centre
right outside, one of the worst
famine camps, trying to feed
these mothers and fathers with
young children who were dying
or already dead, or save them
in some way or another.
I was going down a line of them,
and I saw this girl
slumped over and collapse
on the pavement.
I don't know, something about
her face, or just something
about the nearness of that
appeared to me dying sequence
that I called out to a nurse
and said, nurse, can we
possibly save this girl?
Is there anything we can do?
The nurse runs forward,
picks her up, runs inside the
one room medical centre we
follow with the crew rolling
and capture on her face what we
thought might be the last gasps
of life.
The face, looking outward
seemed to me a symbol, really,
of Ethiopia itself
looking on a unhealthful world,
begging for help kind of stuff,
calling for help.
And the nurse says to us,
I'm afraid there's nothing
we can do.
She's going to die
within 15 minutes.
So it just devastated
all of us.
And we walked, went outside
the room to let her
die in peace.
We later were arranged to come
back to see her burial.
That afternoon we went out
and did other famine stories.
Come back that afternoon
to cover the burial of
Birhan Woldu and do a story
maybe about that.
And we see this group of
people holding the girl.
She's there in her arms
and she's alive.
And I say to a nurse, nurse,
we seem to have seen a bit of
a miracle today, did we?
And she said, yes.
We stuck a needle in her,
and she she will love now.
She will survive.
And I still remember that.
So we later did a story
on her face and the symbolic
of Ethiopia and the story,
seeing if she can survive.
Maybe Ethiopia itself
can survive later.
Live aid, months later
uses an image of her face
and the pictures CBC pictures
of other desperately ill
children in the famine and
that caused such a pouring of
grief and tears around the
world.
Before an audience of
1.1 billion people.
I'm imaginable that it was the
greatest, according to Bob
Geldof, who arranged Live Aid
was the biggest moment of
giving that the whole show had,
and they ran it for four times.
I went back to documentaries
around her years later because
she'd been lost.
We found her, did documentaries
on her, and she appeared in
the second Live Aid
and Dancing with Madonna
on stage.
She's very, very
Christian girl.
And when we first said
she was going to
appear with Madonna, she said
she was really weird.
I thought that was a bit weird.
Anyways, we were on Oprah
together.
Long story short,
had her over here for a holiday.
I arranged for her
and her family, their living
and her education and
now we zoom back and forth
our families.
She has set up a a
small charity in northern
Ethiopia itself for disabled
children in the very poorest of
all areas.
She wants to stay there
and help her people.
These are some old pictures
I kept through the years.
Going back, you know,
childhood ones.
But these are that's me along
the line in Ethiopia of the
famine line where I met Birhan.
Will do.
>> Okay.
Is she in this?
>> She is in this.
This is her.
This is the scene.
That's her slumping against
the cement, this pavement.
That's her father
grieving over her.
That's the nurse would just
rushing in to pick her up
this way.
Went back to find her
four years later.
>> Four years later, right.
>> There outside there.
Hot.
>> I have to imagine that that
story and that relationship is
unique in comparison to all of
the other places and stories
that you've been.
You don't get a chance
to be able to tell
that full circle story.
And I imagine that that must
weigh on you heavily.
I know that in your book you
talk about the moral injury.
What what what can you tell us
about that?
>> Well, it was a long time for
journalism to really realise
the psychological and emotional
damage of being this
professional witness over and
over again and also facing
dangers, which is so much a
part of that life.
It wasn't
really until the '90s that
journalism discovered that PTSD
was ravaging the ranks.
It turned out later there was
another thing called moral
injury, which is not a
psychological mental illness.
It's an emotional one.
Leading psychiatrist in
Toronto, Anthony Feinstein,
as termed that, wound to the
soul, a wound of the spirit
that when you watch things
like that happen over and over
again, even though you may be
doing wonderful work
in terms of a report
that does useful stuff
and you can tell yourself
a hundred times over,
look, it did well.
It was good that we were there.
We helped the aid arrive.
You still feel that as
a human being, you didn't quite
live up to your highest
expectations of yourself
because there were refugee
families.
You didn't stop and load into
your van and drive off with
for to a medical centre.
There was something in
your pocket you didn't hand out
at a given time.
There were other people,
even though you weren't
qualified to do anything,
as I was not qualified to
even give first aid.
What was I doing in a famine?
You kind of feel I could have
done more, I could
have done more.
And that begins over the years
to build to the point where you
have symptoms very like PTSD.
And I had, in fact,
a nervous breakdown
caused by this and was treated
for moral injury successfully.
So I'm glad to say so.
I've lived a very good life
since that.
>> It is no secret, and it's
something that you talk about
through your time at CBC, NBC
and then back.
Newsrooms don't have the
resources that they once did,
and I am curious what happens
to democracy when we lose
the privilege of someone
like you in the field of
foreign correspondent reporting
for the world to see?
>> I think it's a serious loss
for particularly the media.
But also, you know, Canada is a
country that doesn't have the
same kind of diplomatic corps
it used to have.
It's a country that chose
not to even have an overseas
intelligence service of its own.
Like most industrial powers
of our size, cabinet often
seems out to lunch
on the rest of the world
and journalism.
We've just decimated
the ranks of our
overseas coverage.
So we we get stories
from other people.
We don't have Canadian eyes
and ears out there looking for
angles that we as a country
need to be informed about.
And I think the main networks,
the private networks have done,
I'll be quite frank and
horrible job at virtually
eliminating foreign news
coverage by their own bureaus
and reporters.
And the CBC has held a held
a sort of bridge.
So it's still functioning,
but with a much lower impact.
And what happens is we have
fewer reporters out there doing
the job at a time when there's
more stories breaking all the
time, the vortex of news that
goes on 24 over seven,
over and over, crisis upon
crisis, upon crisis,
and the fragmentation of news
makes it very much harder to do
the job out there.
So I'm hoping that this country
gets to a part where
it realises we have got to
start rebuilding
our foreign media sources
overseas, the same way we have
to rebuild our our diplomatic
sources as well, and our
economic sources overseas.
>> Brian, thank you so much.
Really appreciate that.
>> Thank you very.
>> Much, honour.
>> My pleasure indeed.
>> Creating a new show is an
opportunity and we want your
help.
