In
 early
 January,
 Cassuan
 First
 Nation


declared
 a
 state
 of
 emergency.
 Its
 water


system
 had
 failed.
 Its
 nursing
 station


was
 flooded
 with
 raw
 sewage.
 Residents


of
 the
 First
 Nation,
 located
 on
 the
 west


coast
 of
 James
 Bay,
 were
 evacuated
 to


places
 like
 Niagara
 Falls,
 Timmans,
 and


Kingston.
 Others
 have
 chosen
 to
 remain.


Since
 then,
 the
 situation
 has
 only


gotten
 worse.
 Test
 results
 show
 water
 in


the
 community
 is
 contaminated
 with


cryptosperidium,


a
 parasite
 that
 causes
 gastrointestinal


illness.
 Medical
 staff
 who
 were
 on
 site


have
 now
 also
 been
 evacuated.
 We'll
 get


an
 update
 on
 what's
 happening
 on
 the


ground
 and
 what
 it
 will
 take
 to
 make
 the


community
 safe.
 Then
 we're
 going
 to
 zoom


out
 to
 Adawapascat
 First
 Nation,
 a
 place


that
 has
 also
 faced
 its
 share
 of


significant
 challenges.
 Things
 like


inadequate
 housing,
 youth
 suicide
 and
 a


lack
 of
 clean
 drinking
 water.
 Juno


nominated
 musician
 Adrien
 Sutherland
 is


from
 Adawapascal.
 He's
 often
 asked
 why


he
 chooses
 to
 stay.
 We
 talked
 to
 him


about
 his
 new
 memoir
 and
 his
 connection


with
 the
 land
 and
 his
 community.
 Welcome


to
 the
 rundown.


Frozen
 pipes,
 evacuations,
 now
 water


contaminated
 by
 a
 parasite.
 Cases
 First


Nation
 is
 in
 the
 grips
 of
 a
 severe


crisis.
 So,
 how
 is
 the
 community


responding
 and
 what
 needs
 to
 happen
 now?


Tyson
 Wesley
 is
 the
 executive
 director


of
 Casseswan
 First
 Nation
 and
 he
 joins


me
 now
 on
 the
 program.
 Tyson,
 how
 are


you
 doing?


>> I'm
 pretty
 good,
 thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you.
 We
 appreciate
 your
 time
 under


the
 circumstances,
 of
 course.
 Um,
 as
 we


know,
 it's
 been
 just
 over
 a
 month
 uh


since
 a
 local
 state
 of
 emergency
 was


called.
 What's
 the
 latest
 update
 on
 the


situation
 in
 Kashwan?


Well,
 we
 have
 1,700
 people
 that
 have


been
 evacuated
 over
 five
 sites
 in


Ontario.
 Kingston,
 Niagara
 Falls,


Cochran,
 Capis
 Gasing,
 and
 uh
 Timonss.


So,
 and
 we
 have
 300
 less
 than
 300
 people


still
 in
 the
 community.
 Uh
 so
 far,
 we've


kind
 of
 uh
 made
 some
 progress
 with
 u
 the


clinic
 that
 had
 sewage
 backing
 into
 the


basement.
 So
 that's
 been
 completely
 uh


remediated
 and
 all
 our
 uh
 clinic
 staff


kind
 of
 moved
 all
 the
 equipment
 back


into
 the
 nursing
 station.
 However,
 the


as
 the
 test
 results
 came
 in
 for
 crypto,


the
 nursing
 staff
 had
 to
 leave.


>> Uh
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 illness
 for
 for
 for


people
 who
 hear
 this
 parasite,
 um
 people


have
 become
 quite
 ill.
 They
 can
 be
 ill


for
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks.
 how
 serious
 uh


give
 us
 a
 sense
 uh
 for
 people
 who
 are


quite
 healthy
 but
 also
 people
 who
 have


cororidities
 as
 well.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 a
 lot
 the
 r
 the
 symptoms
 range


from
 um
 like
 real
 like
 dehydration
 um
 a


watery
 uh
 diarrhea
 vomiting
 nausea
 um


people
 experienced
 bloating
 um
 sore


stomachs.
 So
 um
 these
 symptoms
 kind
 of


vary
 like
 between
 people.
 Some
 people


are
 still
 experiencing
 symptoms
 after
 uh


two
 weeks
 of
 um
 contracting
 uh
 crypto


and
 it's
 it's
 kind
 of
 varies
 from


person.


>> At
 last
 reports
 there
 were
 about
 just


north
 of
 60
 people
 uh
 who
 uh
 reported
 uh


feeling
 ill.
 Um
 I
 understand
 those


numbers
 probably
 under
 reportported
 as


well.
 Uh
 do
 we
 have
 any
 updates
 on
 those


figures?


I
 think
 we're
 at
 about
 73
 confirmed


cases
 um
 with
 crypto
 with
 about
 19
 that


are
 kind
 of
 not
 been
 tested,
 but
 they


believe
 that
 they
 do
 have
 cryp
 crypto.


Uh
 but
 uh
 the
 numbers
 that
 we're
 kind
 of


having
 are
 kind
 of
 the
 lower
 end.
 Uh


that's
 the
 floor
 I'm
 being
 told
 and
 the


ceiling
 is
 probably
 much
 higher
 since


testing
 wasn't
 immediate.
 And
 um
 if
 one


person
 gets
 crypto
 and
 or
 gets
 diagnosed


with
 crypto
 uh
 tested
 confirmed
 they


don't
 test
 for
 the
 their
 family
 members


in
 the
 same
 household.


>> All right.
 You
 had
 mentioned
 uh
 the


locations
 uh
 that
 uh
 members
 have
 been


evacuated
 to.
 Just
 want
 to
 pull
 up
 a
 map


just
 to
 show
 people
 how
 far
 as
 you


mentioned
 some
 have
 moved
 to
 uh
 have


been
 evacuated
 to
 Capus
 Casing
 and


Timmans
 but
 of
 course
 some
 as
 far
 as


Kingston
 and
 Niagara
 Falls.
 Help
 us


understand
 how
 are
 those
 locations


determined?


Uh
 it's
 um
 the
 locations
 are
 determined


by
 their
 capacity
 to
 accommodate
 um


accommodate
 people
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time


there
 is
 an
 assessment
 of
 their
 health


facilities
 um
 if
 they're
 able
 to
 uh
 meet


demands
 uh
 for
 an
 excessive
 amount
 of


people
 entering
 the
 area.
 So
 um
 they
 do


an
 assessment
 on
 those.
 we
 it's
 like
 um


if
 we
 send
 our
 people
 there,
 are
 they


going
 to
 be
 waiting
 long
 to
 get
 um
 long


for
 hospital
 visits
 and
 whatnot?
 So,


that's
 one
 thing
 that
 they
 really


determine.
 Um
 but
 um
 yeah,
 it's
 it's


it's
 a
 bunch
 of
 stuff
 that
 they
 kind
 of


assess
 prior
 to
 uh
 evacuating
 our
 people


there.
 So,


>> help
 us
 understand
 there,
 as
 you


mentioned,
 there's
 about
 300
 uh
 people,


several
 families
 who
 are
 still
 uh
 in


Cesawan.
 help
 us
 understand
 why
 are
 they


still
 there?
 How
 are
 they
 uh
 able
 to


access
 u
 clean
 drinking
 water
 or
 how
 in


terms
 of
 concerns
 if
 there
 are
 medical


issues
 uh
 where
 is
 the
 next
 uh
 possible


place
 that
 they
 could
 go?


>> Yeah.
 Um
 those
 people
 that
 are
 staying


behind
 as
 our
 crews
 that
 are
 still
 kind


of
 like
 uh
 watching
 people's
 homes,


watching
 um
 pets,
 like
 we
 have
 a
 high


number
 of
 dogs
 in
 the
 in
 the
 community,


so
 we're
 helping
 feed
 them.
 And
 but
 the


other
 thing
 is
 we've
 been
 evacuated
 for


so
 many
 times
 over
 the
 years
 and
 some


people
 are
 just
 fed
 up
 with
 being


evacuated
 and
 decided
 to
 stay
 to
 be
 in


their
 comfort
 at
 home.
 We
 do
 have
 set


guidelines
 right
 now
 to
 kind
 of
 avoid


the
 use
 of
 water
 to
 do
 not
 consume
 it
 uh


to
 make
 sure
 that
 follow
 the
 rules
 that


public
 health
 has
 kind
 of
 set
 up.
 Uh
 I


think
 as
 I
 said
 I
 think
 they're
 just


evacuation
 fatigue
 that's
 happening
 in


the
 community.
 Uh
 as
 I
 said
 the
 nurses


have
 been
 pulled
 out
 and
 right
 now
 there


is
 no
 medical
 staff
 that
 can
 um
 treat


anybody
 uh
 in
 the
 community.
 However
 uh


since
 the
 winter
 road
 is
 open
 at
 the


moment
 uh
 they
 can
 access
 um
 uh
 health


facilities
 in
 Fort
 Albany
 which
 is
 about


an
 hour
 away.
 We've
 been
 we've
 been


trying
 to
 work
 with
 ISC
 to
 kind
 of
 build


a
 shorter
 uh
 winter
 road
 to
 Fort
 Albany,


which
 would
 cut
 the
 time
 in
 half,
 but
 we


haven't
 received
 any
 response
 yet.
 I
 I


want
 to
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the


logistics
 for
 the
 people
 who
 have
 had
 to


evacuate.
 Um
 what
 are
 some
 of
 the


difficulties
 that
 you're
 hearing
 from


being
 so
 far
 away
 from
 home?
 We're


talking
 we're
 talking
 a
 wide
 range
 of
 of


demographics
 and
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 you


know
 elders,
 but
 we're
 also
 talking


about
 students
 who
 are
 in
 the
 midst
 of


of
 finishing
 class
 as
 well.


Yeah,
 it's
 uh
 um
 it's
 it's
 been
 very


difficult,
 very
 difficult
 on
 our
 people


to
 be
 evacuated
 u
 in
 these
 host


communities
 and
 I
 know
 education
 is
 a


big
 thing
 in
 our
 community
 and
 we're


trying
 to
 make
 accommodations
 to
 our
 to


our
 uh
 students
 to
 make
 sure
 that


they're
 still
 kind
 of
 um
 doing
 their


schoolwork.
 I
 think
 there's
 uh
 homework


packages
 that
 are
 being
 set
 up
 by
 the


education
 authority
 to
 kind
 of
 um
 just


the
 continuation
 of
 a
 school.
 Uh
 but


however,
 this
 situation
 is
 is
 really


difficult
 uh
 for
 our
 students
 to
 kind
 of


um
 still
 get
 the
 level
 of
 education
 that


they
 require.
 So
 it
 is
 it
 is
 difficult


and
 exhausting.
 And
 uh
 what
 we've
 been


hearing
 with
 people
 is
 they're
 they're


tired.
 they're
 exhausted
 from
 having
 to


deal
 with
 these
 constant
 uh
 states
 of


emergencies
 for
 our
 community.
 So,
 it
 is


it
 is
 frustrating
 and
 I
 know
 um
 our


people
 are
 are
 just
 tired
 of
 it.
 I
 can


hear
 it
 in
 your
 voice
 and
 I
 know
 Tyson,


you
 are
 no
 stranger
 to
 this.
 2005
 is
 not


that
 uh
 long
 ago
 when
 uh
 an
 evacuation


for
 E.coli
 happened
 that
 uh
 you
 had
 to


experience
 as
 well.
 I
 know
 you're


speaking
 here
 as
 an
 official,
 but
 I
 do


have
 to
 ask,
 how
 are
 you
 doing
 uh


psychologically,
 you
 know,
 with
 having


to
 deal
 with
 this,
 but
 also,
 you
 know,


having
 to
 explain
 uh
 to
 us
 something


that
 has
 been
 in
 the
 headlines
 before,


uh
 unfortunately.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 I
 was
 in
 the
 community
 back
 in


2005.
 I
 I
 remember
 showering
 in
 brown


water,


>> uh
 having
 to
 kind
 of
 uh
 my
 little


cousins
 having
 skin
 issues
 and
 whatnot.


And
 I
 do
 remember
 that
 it's
 it's
 not


it's
 still
 fresh
 in
 my
 mind
 and
 I
 know


even
 with
 the
 community
 it's
 still
 fresh


in
 their
 mind
 and
 having
 to
 to
 to


experience
 something
 again
 is
 is
 quite


difficult
 to
 really
 uh
 to
 uh
 to
 go


through
 I
 guess.
 Uh
 I
 did
 contract


crypto
 myself.
 Um,
 I've
 been
 sick
 for


the
 past
 like
 probably
 over
 two
 weeks


now
 and
 it's
 it's
 been
 frustrating
 to
 to


still
 have
 these
 symptoms
 even
 though


they're
 kind
 of
 going
 away
 slowly.
 So,


um,
 but
 uh
 it
 just
 brings
 back
 memories


of
 what
 happened
 in
 2005
 and
 now
 that


it's
 happening
 again,
 it's
 it's
 it's


kind
 of
 uh
 frustrating
 and
 um
 yeah,
 it's


it's it's
 quite
 uh
 it
 seems
 um


generational
 trauma
 at
 this
 point.
 Um,
 I


remember
 one
 of
 our
 adviserss
 speaking


um
 I
 think
 he
 remembers
 bathing
 his


children
 in
 um
 in
 in
 a
 in
 a
 bucket
 with


with
 bottled
 water
 and
 now
 that
 now
 his


ch
 his
 child
 has
 to
 do
 that
 to
 his


grandson.
 So,
 it's
 it's
 it's
 kind
 of
 uh


really
 emotional
 to
 kind
 of
 see
 that


happen
 again
 and
 kind
 of
 um
 reoccurring


again
 which
 I
 think
 could
 have
 been


avoidable.


>> Well,
 let's
 talk
 about
 that
 in
 terms
 of


um
 solutions.
 Uh
 what
 would
 solve
 this


in
 the
 long
 term?


I
 think
 uh
 like
 like
 right
 now
 we
 are
 u


in
 the
 midst
 of
 a
 water
 crisis
 and
 and


once
 it
 just
 say
 everything
 is
 finished


by


March
 we
 go
 home
 and
 our
 community
 has


to
 prepare
 again
 uh
 to
 evacuate
 because


of
 the
 flooding
 that
 happens
 every
 year


and
 the
 risks
 associated
 with
 that.
 our


people
 are
 in
 this
 loop
 uh
 that's
 that's


always
 happening
 and
 we
 have
 to
 do
 it


again
 in
 a
 few
 months
 and
 it
 it
 is


frustrating.
 The
 long-term
 solution


would
 be
 to
 relocate
 our
 community
 and


to
 expedite
 these
 processes.
 Tyson,
 we


did
 reach
 out
 to
 Indigenous
 Services


Canada
 for
 a
 statement
 on
 the
 crisis
 and


spokesperson
 Eric
 had
 sent
 out
 one
 and


it
 reads
 in
 part,
 Indigenous
 Services


Canada
 ISC
 continues
 to
 work
 closely


with
 Kashawuan
 First
 Nation,
 provincial


partners,
 Mishkawa
 Council,
 Wnebago
 Area


Health
 Authority
 and
 Nishanab
 Aski


Nation
 in
 response
 to
 the
 community's


ongoing
 state
 of
 emergency.
 Minister
 G


Masti
 has
 been
 in
 contact
 with
 Chief


Wesley
 directly
 and
 with
 National
 Chief


Woodhouse
 Nepanak
 regarding
 the


community's
 declaration
 of
 emergency
 and


evacuation.
 ISC
 is
 working
 alongside


leadership
 and
 health
 partners
 to
 make


sure
 that
 community
 members
 have
 access


to
 the
 necessary
 supports
 during
 this


extremely
 difficult
 time.
 How
 do
 you


look
 at
 the
 the
 progress
 on
 potentially


relocating
 your
 community?


>> The
 progress
 has
 been
 slow.
 Well,
 I


think
 we
 should
 have
 been
 definitely


further
 ahead
 and
 in
 and
 moving
 the


community.
 However,
 like
 we
 still
 have


to
 go
 through
 uh
 additions
 to
 reserve


land
 where
 we've
 where
 we
 need
 to
 kind


of
 get
 land
 from
 the
 government
 to
 kind


of
 move
 the
 community
 there
 and
 and
 just


um
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 would
 say
 reducing


these
 these
 studies
 like
 um
 um
 I
 know
 we


can
 do
 it
 but
 uh
 it's
 just
 these


processes
 have
 to
 be
 expediated
 and
 u


just
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 this
 is
 not
 a


annual
 thing
 that
 we
 and
 do
 like
 I'm


sorry
 it's
 just
 just
 frustrating
 like
 um


uh
 we've
 been
 dealing
 with
 this
 for
 over


18
 years
 and
 the
 money
 the
 amount
 of


money
 that
 the
 government
 has
 spent
 um


evacuating
 our
 community
 must
 must


amount
 to
 a
 large
 amount
 of
 money.
 So
 So


is
 is
 the
 government's
 idea
 to
 to


continue
 on
 this
 this
 spending
 dur
 is
 it


cheaper
 for
 them
 to
 evacuate
 us
 every


year
 and
 and
 not
 move
 us?
 Tyson,
 uh,


we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 leave
 it
 there.


We
 appreciate
 you
 taking
 the
 time
 under


the
 circumstances.
 Uh,
 we
 sense
 your


frustration.
 Uh,
 we
 wish,
 uh,
 you
 and


your
 your
 community,
 uh,
 well,
 and
 hope


things,
 uh,
 do
 get
 fixed.
 Thank
 you
 so


much.


>> Thank
 you.

 His
 new
 book,


The

 explores
 the


challenges
 and
 rewards
 of

Walking

looking


>> Adrian,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 taking
 the


time
 to
 chat
 with
 us.
 A
 lovely
 book.


What
 I
 found
 interesting
 is
 it
 reads


like
 a
 memoir
 but
 also
 reads
 like
 a


meditation.
 I'm
 curious
 what
 did
 you


have
 in
 mind
 when
 you
 started
 to
 write


it?


>> It
 was
 clear
 earlier
 on
 that
 I
 wanted
 to


write
 it
 in
 a
 way
 that
 was
 uh
 more
 of
 a


a
 philosophy
 or
 or
 learning
 and
 not
 so


much
 Leon
 trying
 to
 lecture
 people.
 So
 I


wanted
 to
 uh
 to
 ensure
 that
 we
 were
 able


to
 do
 it
 that
 in
 that
 sort
 of
 way
 to


sort
 of
 sharing
 my
 stories
 and
 and
 my


journey.
 The
 first
 scene
 in
 your
 book
 uh


depicts
 quite
 a
 serious
 event
 and
 I'm


curious
 if
 you
 can
 tell
 us
 what
 happened


in
 that
 in
 that
 scenario.
 It
 was
 a
 time


in
 my
 life
 where
 it
 was
 I
 found
 very


difficult
 and
 I
 knew
 that
 uh
 that's


where
 everything
 kind
 of
 really
 changed


for
 me
 and
 things
 kind
 of
 was
 a
 a
 major


turning
 point
 in
 my
 life.
 So,
 and
 it


started,
 I
 think,
 uh,
 it
 started
 that


night
 and
 that
 sort
 of
 set
 off,
 you


know,
 a
 sequence
 a
 sequence
 of
 other


events
 that
 kind
 of
 led
 me
 to
 rehab.


Certainly,
 I
 think
 I
 hit
 what
 they
 call


rock
 bottom


>> and
 uh
 that
 was
 a
 scary
 moment
 and
 for


me
 it
 it
 really
 got
 me
 thinking
 about
 uh


my
 life
 and
 and
 and
 wanting
 to
 get


better.
 So,
 um,
 so
 when
 we
 back
 up
 and


we
 look
 at
 how
 difficult
 things
 might


have
 been
 growing
 up,
 you
 know,
 the
 loss


of
 my
 father
 and,
 um,
 I
 had
 alcoholism,


uh,
 in
 my
 home,
 just
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of


hardships
 and
 loss.
 Um,
 being
 separated


from
 my
 siblings
 and
 and
 things
 like


that
 and
 and
 also
 being
 rejected,
 I


think
 because
 of
 my
 mixed
 ethnicity.
 Uh,


feeling
 that
 rejection,
 you
 know,
 come


from
 my
 maternal
 and
 paternal


grandparents,
 my
 grandfather


particularly.
 It
 wasn't
 easy.
 I
 found
 it


really
 difficult
 and
 I
 felt
 it,
 you


know,
 at
 a
 young
 age.
 Um,
 and
 it
 was
 it


was
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 uh
 to
 kind
 of
 process


that,
 especially
 uh
 in
 my
 younger
 years.


>> People
 know
 you
 for
 your
 music.
 Uh


people
 know
 that
 uh
 through
 this
 book,


the
 challenge
 that
 you
 go
 through.


Wonder
 if
 you
 can
 help
 connect
 that.
 How


has
 music
 been
 a
 refuge
 for
 you
 through


some
 of
 those
 hard
 times?

 he
 talked
 about
 hitting
 rock
 bottom


earlier
 and
 wanting
 to
 take
 my
 own
 life,


what
 I
 certainly
 felt
 in
 that
 moment
 was


I
 had
 no
 control.
 Uh
 I
 lost
 control
 of


everything.
 And
 that
 that
 was
 a
 scary


scary
 feeling
 to
 to
 have
 that
 complete


loss
 of
 control
 over
 over
 yourself
 and


scaring
 the
 people
 around
 me
 that
 I


cared
 about.
 And
 then
 moving
 forward


into
 rehab
 from
 there
 and
 and
 uh
 you


know
 understanding
 what
 was
 going
 on


with
 me
 and
 learning
 about
 that
 and
 how


to
 cope
 with
 all
 those
 things
 and


rediscovering
 music
 while
 in
 rehab
 and


being
 able
 to
 use
 that
 as
 a
 tool
 to
 kind


of
 um
 you
 know
 let
 go
 of
 certain
 things.


um
 um
 like
 to
 be
 able
 to
 release,
 you


know,
 kind
 of
 saying
 art
 is
 really
 uh


good
 for
 being
 able
 to
 uh
 find
 a
 place


for
 those
 emotions
 and
 those
 feelings
 to


kind
 of
 live,
 you
 know,
 and
 let
 go
 and


put
 them
 out
 into
 the
 world.


>> Part
 of
 that
 journey
 is
 also
 uh


experiencing
 the
 sweat
 lodge.
 You


describe
 your
 first
 experience
 where
 you


weren't
 planning
 to
 take
 part
 in
 a
 in
 a


fast.
 Uh
 you
 were
 there
 to
 help.
 What
 do


those
 rituals
 mean
 for
 for
 someone
 like


you,
 but
 also
 for
 CRE
 people
 uh
 to
 to
 be


able
 to
 take
 that
 space
 in
 in
 a
 sweat


lodge
 and
 and and
 spiritually?
 What
 does


that
 mean
 for
 you?
 Well,
 I
 think
 yeah,


the
 first
 fast
 I
 ever
 went
 to,
 I
 mean,
 I


was
 always
 aware
 of
 those
 things
 because


uh
 my
 family
 was
 around
 them
 and
 I
 I've


seen
 them
 and
 I've,
 you
 know,
 certainly


heard
 a
 lot
 about
 them
 growing
 up,
 but


never
 really
 felt
 that
 I
 wanted
 to
 be
 in


those
 places
 because
 uh,
 you
 know,
 what


was
 going
 on
 personally
 with
 me.
 And
 it


wasn't
 until
 I
 got
 um
 through
 rehab
 and


then
 I
 went
 uh
 went
 to
 the
 ceremony
 up


in
 French
 River
 just
 just
 uh
 just
 west


of
 the
 moose
 factory,
 the
 community


moose
 factory.
 And
 I
 attended
 a
 ceremony


there
 um
 for
 the
 first
 time
 with
 my


brother
 uh
 who
 always
 invited
 me,
 you


know,
 when
 he'd
 come
 through.
 He
 said,


"You
 need
 to
 come."
 And
 I
 always
 say,


"Yeah,
 I'll
 get
 you
 next
 time."
 But


anyway,
 I
 went
 that
 year
 and
 I
 had
 no


real
 intention
 of
 of
 doing
 it,
 you
 know,


being
 really
 fully
 participating
 in


anything
 that
 was
 going
 on,
 but
 I
 just


wanted
 to
 know
 more
 about
 what
 it
 was


about.
 And
 uh
 so
 I
 went


>> and
 uh
 they
 started
 off
 by
 building
 the


lodge
 that
 day.
 And
 you
 know,
 people


have
 their
 camps
 and
 they
 build
 their


tents
 and
 set
 everything
 up.
 And
 uh
 we


had
 a
 feast
 that
 night.
 And
 you
 know
 the


the
 person
 running
 the
 ceremony
 began
 by


you
 know
 rendering
 us
 the
 pipe
 ceremony


and
 then
 and
 then
 the
 prayer
 started


then
 the
 singing
 started
 and
 it
 was
 such


an
 amazing
 experience
 for
 me
 and
 I
 felt


really
 connected
 to
 to
 to
 all
 of
 that


even
 though
 um
 I
 didn't
 really
 you
 know


put
 myself
 and
 immerse
 myself
 into
 that


growing
 up
 but
 I
 felt
 like
 I
 was
 meant


to
 be
 there
 and
 and
 there
 was
 something


that
 really
 called
 to
 me
 that
 that


particular
 night
 and
 uh
 And
 when
 they


asked
 how
 many
 fasters
 are
 here
 and
 I


had
 like
 I
 had
 not
 even
 thought
 about
 it


and
 I
 just
 I'll
 fast.
 Um
 so
 I
 uh
 I
 you


know
 I
 volunteered
 to
 fast
 and
 uh
 and


that
 was
 my
 first
 fast.
 Uh
 was
 probably


it
 was
 a
 young
 man
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 it
 was


a
 very
 for
 me
 it
 was
 a
 it
 was
 a
 very
 uh


it
 was
 almost
 like
 an
 awakening
 I
 guess


in
 some
 way
 and
 it
 really
 opened
 my
 eyes


to
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 things.
 cuz
 I
 never


looked
 at
 the
 world
 the
 same
 way
 again


because
 when
 you
 do
 something
 spiritual


like
 that
 um
 it
 changes
 you
 um
 and
 uh


some
 of
 the
 things
 you
 experience
 uh


that
 are
 difficult
 to
 believe
 but
 you


know
 like
 I
 seen
 it
 with
 my
 own
 eyes.
 I


felt
 it.


>> Well,
 there
 are
 something
 that
 happens


on
 sort
 of
 the
 last
 day.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 You
 get
 uh
 you
 know
 you
 go


there
 and
 you
 ask
 for
 the
 things
 like


good
 health
 uh
 protection
 to
 have
 the


strength
 to
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 things
 but


you
 also
 go
 go
 there
 to
 get
 to
 know
 who


you
 are.
 And
 when
 you
 stop
 the
 water
 and


the
 food
 for
 several
 days,
 um
 just
 like


your
 human
 grandparents
 and
 creator,


they
 get
 concerned.
 Why
 are
 you
 not


eating?
 Why
 are
 you
 not
 drinking?
 It's


the
 same
 thing
 on
 the
 spiritual
 side.


They
 say
 they
 get
 concerned
 and
 they
 and


they
 come,
 they
 say
 they
 come
 to
 see
 you


and
 visit
 with
 you
 and
 and
 uh
 because


they
 care
 about
 us
 even
 on
 the
 spiritual


side.
 Um
 so
 it's
 important
 for
 us
 to
 not


only
 get
 to
 know
 the
 physical
 world
 and


and
 our
 grandparents
 and
 uh
 we
 need
 to


get
 to
 know
 that
 spiritual
 side
 as
 well


and
 that's
 how
 we
 one
 way
 uh
 cre
 people


and
 other
 indigenous
 cultures
 um
 are


able
 to
 do
 that.
 you
 are
 fluent
 in
 Cree.


Um,
 and
 you
 talk
 in
 your
 book
 of,
 you


know,
 being
 able
 to
 speak
 to,
 uh,
 people


in
 your
 language,
 uh,
 and
 some
 people


who
 aren't,
 uh,
 able
 to,
 um,
 and
 how


that
 that
 there's
 some
 bonds
 that
 you


make
 because
 of,
 uh,
 your
 fluency
 in
 it.


What
 does
 it
 mean
 to
 you
 and
 your
 family


that
 you
 are
 able
 to
 speak
 your


language?


Well,
 for
 me
 it's
 it's
 it's
 I
 feel
 like


I'm
 very
 uh
 fortunate
 um
 to
 be
 able
 to


speak
 my
 language
 and
 I
 because
 I
 I
 meet


a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 who
 aren't
 able
 to


speak
 their
 language
 and
 I
 feel
 really


bad
 for
 them
 because
 I
 know
 they're


they're
 they're
 trying
 to
 reconnect.


They're
 trying
 to
 learn
 their
 language


and
 it's
 it's
 very
 difficult
 for
 them
 um


not
 growing
 up
 around
 their
 language,


not
 not
 hearing
 it
 and
 not
 able
 to
 speak


it.
 And
 uh
 I
 hear
 that
 it's
 it's
 like
 a


it's
 almost
 like
 a
 mourning,
 you
 know,


like
 I
 I
 feel
 that
 sort
 of
 uh
 it
 kind
 of


give
 off
 that
 kind
 of
 feeling.
 So
 I'm


just
 been
 very
 very
 fortunate
 that
 I
 was


able
 to
 learn
 my
 language
 and
 uh
 I
 think


a
 big
 part
 of
 that
 is
 because
 I
 a
 lot
 of


far
 north
 bands
 are
 very
 uh
 they
 have


very
 uh
 strong
 language
 retention


because
 of
 the
 isolation.


you
 sort
 of
 describe
 yourself
 as
 a


teacher
 when
 you
 talk
 about
 your
 sweat


lodge,
 but
 even
 with
 through
 language
 as


well.
 And
 I'm
 curious,
 how
 does
 your


vocation
 as
 a
 teacher
 uh
 overlap
 with


being
 a
 musician?


>> Oh,
 good
 question.
 Um,
 I
 I
 think
 well
 in


the
 music
 uh
 I
 I
 always
 tried
 to
 do
 it


in
 a
 way
 I
 mean
 it's
 a
 little
 bit


politically
 driven
 but
 it's
 always
 been


uh
 it's
 always
 been
 that
 way
 but
 I


always
 try
 to
 take
 you
 know
 it
 may
 even


if
 it's
 not
 about
 something
 that's
 very


positive
 I
 always
 try
 to
 get
 to
 a
 better


place
 with
 the
 music.
 Uh
 I
 believe
 it's


for
 everyone,
 you
 know,
 and
 uh
 like
 the


book,
 I
 tried
 to
 to
 make
 this
 book
 uh
 um


for
 everyone.
 And
 uh
 so
 I've
 always


tried
 to
 use
 music
 in
 a
 way
 that
 is
 uh


um
 again
 just
 sort
 of
 universal
 themes


that
 we
 all
 can
 kind
 of
 understand
 and


we
 can
 all
 relate
 to.
 Um
 and
 yeah,
 I


mean
 in
 some
 of
 the
 music
 is
 teaching,


you
 know,
 we
 we
 we
 talk
 about
 uh
 um
 in


some
 of
 the
 songs
 I
 talk
 about
 uh
 loss,


you
 know,
 um
 I
 talk
 about
 some
 of
 the


songs
 are
 in
 Cree.
 So
 those
 are
 some
 of


the
 songs
 I
 thought
 that
 would
 be
 really


good


to
 make
 um
 so
 people
 can,
 you
 know,


learn
 to
 sing
 the
 song
 in
 Cree
 and
 then


they
 learn
 are
 also
 learning
 at
 the
 same


time
 about
 their
 language.
 So,
 so
 and


those
 are
 some
 of
 the
 ways
 I
 I
 try
 to


use
 music
 as
 as
 uh
 as
 teaching
 tools.


>> Ain't
 no
 hiding
 in
 here.


This
 is
 precious.


>> You
 describing
 carrying
 water
 uh
 from


the
 age
 of
 five
 up
 until
 today
 uh
 as
 an


act
 of
 love.
 Tell
 me
 about
 that.


>> Well,
 from
 the
 earliest
 age,
 well,
 um
 we


used
 to
 have
 these
 little
 pills
 that


were
 small
 and
 they
 you
 uh
 we
 bought


them
 at
 the Hudson's
 Bay.
 They
 come
 they


usually
 lard
 in
 there.
 So
 that
 we
 always


had
 one
 for
 water
 and
 just
 carrying


different
 things.
 Um
 so
 my
 grandma
 made


me
 go
 get
 water
 uh
 to
 fill
 the
 washer


for
 dishes
 and
 and
 you
 know
 um
 bathing


or
 whatever
 like like
 daily
 thing
 and


then
 we
 did
 snow
 in
 winter
 um
 which
 we


collected
 in
 those
 I
 don't
 know
 if


you've
 ever
 seen
 them
 but
 the
 Canada


Post
 bag
 usually
 blue
 or
 orange
 bright


colors
 but
 we
 use
 those
 cuz
 they're
 made


of
 polyester


>> so
 it
 won't
 break


>> and
 Yeah.
 So,
 we
 use
 those
 and
 we'd
 fill


them
 with
 snow
 and
 uh
 we
 also
 had
 a


barrel
 that
 we
 use
 in
 the
 winter
 that
 we


would
 put
 down
 sideways
 and
 we
 my


grandfather
 cut
 a
 hole
 uh
 through
 the


top
 and
 we'd
 fill
 that
 thing
 with
 a


little
 cup
 cuz
 they
 they
 keep
 the
 ice
 uh


open.
 They
 keep
 it
 a
 hole
 in
 the
 ice


open
 all
 winter
 long
 so
 we
 could
 you


know
 put
 in
 ice,
 snow
 and
 water
 and
 we


kind
 of
 mix
 it
 all
 together.
 So,
 that


was
 kind
 of
 our
 job.
 Um
 and
 we
 do
 that


on
 the
 little
 snow
 machine.
 Um,
 so
 like


yeah,
 the
 tools
 sort
 of
 varied,
 you


know,
 to
 collecting
 water,
 but
 it
 it
 it


was
 I
 remember
 it
 always
 being
 my
 job


and
 it
 still
 is,
 you
 know,
 my
 job,
 my


son's,
 it's
 their
 job
 now
 to
 to
 make


sure
 that
 we
 have
 the
 water.


>> Throughout
 your
 book,
 you
 talk
 about


sort
 of
 these
 key
 moments,
 uh,
 one
 where


you
 go
 hunting
 and
 stuff
 like
 that,
 but


even
 something
 as
 simple
 as
 that
 we
 look


at
 here,
 something
 as
 simple
 as
 getting


water.
 What's
 the
 message
 to
 your
 son
 in


that
 moment?


>> Well,
 for
 me,
 it's
 it's
 not
 just
 like
 a


chore.
 It's
 a
 philosophy
 and
 I
 think


it's
 a
 rhythm,
 you
 know,
 of
 life
 that
 we


get
 into
 up
 there.
 Whether
 it's
 building


or
 we
 harvest
 something
 to
 eat
 with
 our


hands,
 it's
 always
 something
 to
 do
 with


our
 hands.
 I
 think
 getting
 water,
 yeah,


it's
 it's
 it's
 physically
 demanding
 and


it's
 an
 it
 is
 uh
 it
 does
 feel
 like
 an


inconvenience
 and
 some
 days
 there's
 a


lineup.
 It's
 something
 that
 we
 do


because
 we
 have
 to
 do
 it.
 It's
 not
 a


choice
 uh
 for
 us
 up
 there.
 And
 uh
 even


though


it's
 difficult
 at
 some
 days
 to
 to
 push


yourself
 to
 to
 make
 sure,
 you
 know,
 if


you're
 if
 you're
 down
 with
 the
 flu,
 like


you
 got
 to
 get
 water
 still,
 like
 you


know,
 you're
 down
 for
 the
 flu
 for
 a
 few


days,
 you
 still
 got
 to
 go
 and
 do
 it.


Like
 it's
 it's
 not
 like,
 no,
 I'm
 going


to
 do
 it
 when
 I'm
 better.
 No,
 it's
 like


you
 got
 to
 get
 up
 and
 go
 get
 it.
 It's


something
 I
 accept.
 And
 uh
 uh
 even


though
 it's
 it's
 it's
 very
 hard
 at


times,
 um
 I
 still
 think
 I
 I
 live
 a
 very


beautiful
 life
 up
 there.


>> A
 lot
 has
 probably
 changed
 uh
 from


how
 you
 grew
 up
 and
 where
 you
 grew
 up
 in


Adawapsa
 to
 what
 it
 is
 now.
 Can
 you
 tell


us
 a
 little
 bit?
 Is
 is
 there
 a
 big


change
 in
 sort
 of
 what
 you
 see
 that
 is


always
 home
 that
 will
 always
 be
 home
 for


you,
 but
 is
 it
 has
 it
 changed
 a
 lot?


>> There's
 been
 Yeah,
 there's
 been
 there's


been
 change.
 Um
 in
 some
 ways
 though
 we
 I


feel
 like
 we
 still
 we
 still
 live
 in
 the


stone
 age
 uh
 or
 still
 living
 in
 the


stone
 ages
 but
 but
 uh
 there
 has
 been


change
 I
 think
 uh
 I
 mean
 the
 water
 has


improved
 the
 water
 quality
 has
 improved


you
 know
 from
 having
 no
 running
 water
 as


a
 kid
 up
 until
 it
 was
 like
 95
 90
 98
 I


think
 we
 got
 plumbed
 our
 house
 got


plumbed
 so
 we
 we
 didn't
 have
 anything


prior
 to
 that
 so
 yes
 there
 has
 there


have
 been
 changes
 but
 I
 mean
 you
 could


never
 drink
 the
 the
 water
 from
 the
 tap


like
 uh
 for
 for
 many
 many
 many
 years
 you


know
 that
 water
 is
 like
 poison
 drinking


poison.
 So
 and
 you
 know
 people
 bathe
 in


that
 and
 uh
 the
 the
 information
 the


advice
 we
 were
 getting
 from
 Health


Canada
 was
 do
 not
 bathe
 longer
 than
 2


minutes
 in
 that
 water.
 Um
 you
 know
 don't


breathe
 the
 vapors
 from
 the
 water
 tap.


Uh
 so
 when
 you
 hear
 those
 kinds
 of


things
 you're
 just
 like
 what
 like
 what


is
 going
 on
 here?
 uh
 anyone
 I
 think
 uh


would
 find
 that
 very
 very
 alarming


>> with
 that
 those
 you
 know
 unfortunately


those
 are
 the
 headlines
 that
 a
 lot
 of


people
 read
 but
 I'm
 curious
 what
 do
 you


want
 people
 to
 know
 out
 of
 Wabiscat
 for


>> we're
 not
 asking
 to
 be
 rescued
 we're


active
 participants
 in
 our
 in
 our
 own


lives
 and
 and
 you
 know
 I
 think
 we
 are


surviving
 we
 we
 all
 are
 in
 a
 rhythm
 of


survival
 up
 there
 we
 uh
 we
 have a
 wealth


of
 knowledge
 about
 how
 to
 survive
 on
 the


land
 and
 I
 think
 most
 of
 us
 that
 are
 up


there
 choose
 to
 live
 there
 because
 we


love
 the
 lifestyle.
 As
 I
 mentioned


earlier,
 you
 can
 live
 a
 very
 hard
 life,


but
 you
 can
 also
 have
 a
 very
 beautiful


life
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 Those
 two
 things


can
 coexist.
 Um,
 and
 I
 love
 the


connection
 to
 the
 land.
 I
 love
 the
 CRE


culture,
 the
 CRE
 tradition.
 Uh,
 that's


why
 I'm
 there.


>> Adrian,
 we're
 going
 to
 leave
 it
 there.


Thank
 you
 so
 much.
 Really
 appreciate
 it.


I
 ain't
 ashamed
 of
