>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 OddLots
 podcast.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Aloway


>> and
 I'm
 Joe
 Weisenthal.


>> Joe,
 I've
 been
 reflecting
 on
 this
 year.


It's
 been
 a
 busy
 year.
 Yeah,
 go
 on.


>> In
 fact,
 we're
 recording
 this.
 We're
 on


yet
 another
 trip.


>> I
 know.


>> We're
 in
 Huntington
 Beach
 for
 this


year's
 Future
 Proof
 Conference,
 which
 is


>> always
 a
 fun
 time.


>> An
 event
 I
 always
 enjoy,
 but
 we
 have


been
 on
 the
 road
 a
 lot.


>> We
 have.


>> And
 I
 feel
 like
 the
 entire
 year
 is


starting
 to
 feel
 very
 surreal
 for
 me.
 It


feels
 just
 very
 different
 to
 prior
 years


for
 many
 different
 reasons.
 But
 I
 was


also
 thinking
 one
 of
 those
 reasons
 is


because


>> it
 seems
 harder
 and
 harder
 to
 do


portfolio
 construction
 nowadays.
 And
 I


know
 that
 sounds
 really
 weird
 given
 that


like
 markets
 are
 still
 at
 record
 highs


and
 everything
 seems
 to
 be
 going


reasonably
 well
 even
 though
 we
 had
 that


terrible
 jobs
 number.
 But
 if
 I
 think


back
 to
 the
 big
 leg
 down
 that
 we
 saw


this
 year,


>> it
 seemed
 really
 scary
 because
 basically


everything
 sold
 off
 at
 once,
 right?


>> You
 know what
 I
 really
 like?
 I
 like
 how


you
 started
 this
 with
 this
 philosophical


thing.
 It's
 like
 we're
 out
 on
 the
 road


and
 all
 this


>> and
 then
 I
 was
 like,
 how
 do
 I
 protect
 my


portfolio?
 and
 reflecting
 and
 the


surality
 of
 the
 times
 and
 now
 we
 bring


it
 around
 to
 portfolio
 construction
 but


no
 there's
 true
 and
 there's
 two
 a
 couple


things
 going
 on
 so
 one
 is
 the
 sort
 of


like
 cross
 asset
 class
 moves
 the
 other


thing
 is
 and
 it's
 very
 related
 to
 that
 I


mean
 it's
 the
 flip
 side
 of
 this
 which
 is


correlation
 breakdown
 and
 then
 there
 is


still
 this
 other
 element
 that
 I
 think
 is


at
 play
 where
 at
 least
 like


>> I
 would
 say
 there's
 two
 more
 things


which
 is
 that
 one
 within
 US
 assets
 the


winners
 are
 still
 the
 winners
 right


especially
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 big
 tech
 names


so
 you
 haven't
 gotten
 the
 sort
 secular


>> and
 people
 have
 been
 talking
 about


overvaluations
 for
 ages,


>> forever.


>> And
 then
 the
 fact
 that,
 you
 know,
 you're


not
 getting
 paid
 much
 to
 take
 on


volatility
 risk
 or
 volatility
 measures


are
 still
 very
 low.
 So
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


difficult
 unintuitive
 things
 going
 on


>> and
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 a
 tail
 risk


hedge
 actually
 looks
 like
 at
 this
 point


because
 I
 would
 have
 thought
 like
 well


obviously
 maybe
 you
 diversify
 into


longduration
 bonds
 or
 something
 like


that
 but
 then
 in
 April
 when
 we
 had
 the


big
 sell-off
 long
 duration
 did
 not
 do


that
 well
 either.
 So,
 it
 kind
 of
 has
 me


scratching
 my
 head
 about
 if
 you
 were


worried
 about
 stuff
 both
 literally
 and


figuratively
 perhaps
 blowing
 up
 at
 this


point
 in
 time.
 What
 would
 you
 be
 doing?


Like
 what
 does
 a
 tail
 risk
 hedge


actually
 look
 like
 nowadays?


>> You
 like
 buy
 gold?
 That's
 already
 a


record
 high.
 So,
 yeah,
 it's
 confusing.


>> Yes.
 Okay.
 So,
 on
 that
 note,
 I'm
 very


happy
 to
 say
 we
 actually
 have
 the


perfect
 guest
 to
 talk
 about
 tail
 risk


insurance
 and
 just
 tail
 risks
 in


general.
 someone
 who's
 been
 working
 on


Wall
 Street
 for
 a
 really,
 really
 long


time
 and
 has
 a
 very
 storied
 career.
 Lots


of
 stories
 involving
 big
 names
 that
 you


and
 I
 would
 definitely
 recognize.
 We're


going
 to
 be
 speaking
 with
 Veneer
 Benali.


He
 is
 of
 course
 the
 founder
 of
 a


longtail
 alpha
 and
 again
 has
 worked
 at


many,
 many
 firms
 previously.
 We'll
 get


into
 all
 of
 that.
 Veneer,
 thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 coming
 on
 Hot
 Thoughts.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.
 So
 I
 should


just
 go
 ahead
 and
 ask
 you
 to
 give
 a
 sort


of
 fiveinut
 summary
 of
 your
 career


because
 it
 is
 kind
 of
 amazing.
 But
 the


important
 thing
 is
 you
 didn't
 start
 out


as
 a
 trader.
 You
 started
 out
 as
 a


mathematician.


>> Yep.
 I
 started
 out
 as
 a
 theoretical


physicist.
 I
 was
 finishing
 my
 PhD
 at


Harvard
 and
 this
 is
 1991.
 The
 recession


had
 just
 hit.
 I
 didn't
 know
 what
 a


recession
 was.
 I
 wanted
 to
 be
 a


professor.
 But
 my
 job
 evaporated
 because


I
 was
 going
 to
 go
 work
 at
 the
 super


colliders
 the
 superconducting
 super


collider
 that
 got
 cancelled
 by
 Congress


1990s.


>> I
 had
 a
 postoc
 lined
 up
 in
 France
 and


one
 I
 think
 it
 was
 in
 Texas
 in
 Austin


>> and
 I
 got
 a
 call
 out
 of
 Wall
 Street
 out


of
 Goldman.
 They
 were
 looking
 for
 quants


like
 me
 to
 work
 on
 options
 trading
 or


options
 model
 building
 rather
 I
 should


say.
 So
 I
 went
 and
 interviewed
 mostly


because
 it
 was a
 free
 trip
 to
 New
 York.


So
 I
 went
 there,
 got
 interviewed
 by
 an


elderly
 gentleman
 who
 was
 taking
 notes


saying
 doesn't
 know
 any
 finance.
 Full


disclosure,
 I
 knew
 no
 finance.
 I
 had
 no


interest
 in
 it.
 It
 was
 Fisher
 Black
 who


was
 interviewing
 me.


>> Oh
 wow.


>> I
 decided,
 you
 know,
 Black
 Scholes
 fame.


Little
 did
 I
 know
 when
 I
 turned
 that
 job


down
 from
 Goldman,
 I
 took
 another
 job
 at


City
 Bank
 trading
 derivatives
 cuz
 in
 my


mind
 it
 was
 a
 sabbatical.
 I
 was
 going
 to


do
 this
 for
 about
 6
 months
 to
 a
 year
 and


then
 go
 back
 to
 physics.


>> Mh.
 Well,
 little
 did
 I
 know
 that
 my


whole
 life
 would
 become
 basically
 very


deeply
 connected
 with
 option
 trading.


So,
 that's
 what
 I've
 been
 doing.
 And


we'll
 talk
 a
 lot
 more
 about
 Taylor


sketching
 in
 a
 second.


>> Wait,
 I
 got
 to
 ask
 why
 did
 you
 decide
 to


turn
 down
 Goldman
 given
 that
 Fischer


Black
 himself
 was
 doing
 the
 interview


and
 you
 chose
 to
 go
 to
 City
 at
 that


time?
 Well,
 one
 was
 a
 research
 job
 at


Goldman
 and
 the
 job
 at
 city
 was
 actually


trading
 derivatives
 and
 uh
 since
 trading


was
 so
 far
 away
 from
 what
 I
 knew
 and


this
 was
 really
 supposed
 to
 be
 a


vacation
 for
 me
 for
 about
 a
 year
 like


sound
 like
 a
 good
 thing
 to
 do
 or
 fun


thing
 to
 do
 rather.


>> Did
 you
 ever
 feel
 like
 I'm
 always
 so


curious
 about
 stories
 from
 the
 early


days
 of
 physicists
 going
 to
 Wall
 Street


was
 there
 a
 period
 where
 you
 felt
 like


it
 was
 a
 bit
 bene
 I
 mean
 you
 call
 it


kind
 of
 a
 vacation
 job.
 Did
 it
 feel


intellectually
 beneath
 you
 for
 a
 while


and
 then
 did
 it
 eventually
 become
 sort


of
 genuinely
 intellectually
 satisfying


in
 the
 way
 that
 maybe
 you
 had


anticipated
 an
 academic
 career
 to


become?


>> So
 interesting.
 So
 the
 modeling


certainly
 at
 those
 days
 seemed
 a
 little


too
 naive.
 So
 for
 instance,
 I'll
 give


you
 an
 example.
 Very
 first
 trade
 that
 we


did
 large
 trade
 I
 was
 bank
 at
 the
 time


and
 it
 was
 an
 interest
 rate
 cap
 on
 yen


interest
 rates
 linked
 to
 the
 dollar
 yen.


So
 it
 was
 basically
 a
 two-factor
 option


called
 a
 hybrid
 option.
 And
 it
 turned


out
 that
 as
 a
 physicist
 I
 was
 very
 easy.


It
 was
 very
 easy
 for
 me
 and
 I
 was
 very


able
 to
 write
 a
 Monte
 Carlo
 to
 write


this
 knockout
 cap.
 But
 for
 the
 finance


people
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 tough.
 So
 the
 math


was
 very
 easy.


>> But
 I
 also
 learned
 that
 trading
 is
 not


just
 math.
 Trading
 is
 a
 lot
 of


behavioral
 stuff
 and
 so
 on.
 And
 that
 I


just
 obviously
 had
 to
 learn.
 And
 I
 have


some
 great
 stories
 of
 stuff
 that
 I
 did


really
 badly
 back
 in
 199094.


>> Tell
 us
 the
 story
 about
 something
 you


did
 badly.


>> Well,
 to
 1994,
 if
 you
 remember,
 you


know,
 1993,
 the
 Fed
 had
 eased
 and
 rates


were
 quite
 low
 and
 everybody
 was
 long


the
 front
 end
 of
 the
 yield
 curve
 and


buying
 EUR
 dollar
 futures
 contracts.


>> Wait,
 didn't
 a
 town
 around
 here
 go


bankrupt?


>> Yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 We'll
 get
 to
 that.


Exactly.
 So,
 February
 of
 1994,
 the
 Fed


raised
 rates
 by
 25.
 And
 then
 very


surprisingly
 April
 18th
 of
 that
 year


they
 did
 an
 intermeating
 increase
 and
 at


that
 time
 bond
 market
 really
 sold
 off


quite
 a
 bit
 and
 I
 just
 did
 what
 human


beings
 do
 which
 is
 bet
 on
 mean


reversion.
 And
 so
 I
 tried
 to
 buy
 the


bond
 market
 and
 tried
 to
 buy
 the
 bond


market
 again
 and
 again
 and
 again
 until
 I


realized
 that
 there's
 something
 called


trend
 following
 and
 exit
 and
 I
 think
 the


bond
 market
 sold
 off
 a
 good
 15
 20
 points


and
 finally
 I
 recouped
 it
 all
 but
 it
 was


a
 brutal
 few
 months
 of
 literally
 getting


my
 face
 ripped
 off.
 So
 one
 other
 thing


I'm
 curious
 about
 the
 sort
 of
 early
 days


of
 quants
 but
 what
 exactly
 was
 the
 pitch


to
 scientists
 whether
 they're
 you
 know


mathematicians
 or
 physics
 guys
 when


these
 big
 banks
 or
 big
 trading
 firms
 are


trying
 to
 recruit
 back
 then
 because
 you


know
 like
 quant
 was
 in
 the
 I
 know
 we
 had


1987
 by
 then
 but
 it
 was
 still
 relatively


in
 the
 early
 days
 so
 I'm
 really
 curious


like
 what
 they
 told
 you
 about
 what
 you


would
 be
 doing.
 So
 in
 the
 from
 the


modeling
 side
 it's
 pretty


straightforward
 right
 the
 black
 shields


equation
 and
 stochastic
 calculus


stoastic
 finance
 is
 basically
 what's


called
 the
 heat
 equation
 or
 the


diffusion
 equation
 in
 physics
 and
 that's


something
 that
 every
 physicist
 learns


when
 they're
 in
 early
 graduate
 school.


It's
 like
 solving
 a
 partial
 differential


equation.
 So
 the
 math
 is
 exactly


identical
 the
 math
 of
 finance.
 And
 maybe


that's
 a
 problem
 actually
 in
 in


retrospect
 now
 that
 having
 done
 this
 for


30
 years
 and
 30
 plus
 years
 and
 survived


maybe
 that's
 a
 problem
 because
 the


beauty
 can
 somehow
 hide
 the
 frictions


that
 are
 underneath
 it.


>> From
 the
 trading
 side
 when
 I
 first


started
 trading
 I
 think
 it
 was
 very


simply
 being
 mathematically
 sharp
 and


quick
 uh
 and
 being
 able
 to
 answer


quizzes
 just
 made
 interviewers
 feel
 like


they
 were
 getting
 smart
 people
 on
 the


desk
 that
 they
 could
 train,
 right?
 The


blank
 canvas
 so
 to
 speak.


>> Yeah.
 So
 once
 people
 on
 these
 desks
 got


armed
 with
 PhD
 physicists
 and


understanding
 of
 like
 Brownian
 motion


and
 stuff
 like
 that,
 did
 that
 change
 how


the
 actual
 markets
 traded
 from
 your


perspective?
 Like
 sort
 of
 pre
 and
 post


that
 did
 assets
 conform
 more
 to
 as


models
 anticipated
 because
 of
 the
 model


effect
 on
 them
 like
 what
 was
 your


observation
 of
 actual
 existing
 market


behavior
 pre
 and
 post
 the
 physics


revolution?


>> Oh,
 absolutely.
 And
 this
 is
 a
 very


important
 question
 because
 if
 you
 fast


forward
 to
 2018,
 the
 big
 XIV
 debacle
 and


the
 Volmageddon
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 that


happen
 now
 and
 actually
 fundamentally


what
 we
 do
 now,
 what
 I
 do
 now
 is
 related


to
 this
 fact
 that
 there's
 a
 very
 tight


feedback
 loop
 between
 models
 and
 markets


and
 models.
 So
 give
 you
 a
 very
 simple


example,
 right?
 If
 you
 have
 an
 option


that
 you've
 sold
 to
 somebody
 and
 you


have
 to
 manage
 the
 risk,
 of
 course,
 when


you
 sell
 the
 option,
 you're
 getting
 a


volatility
 premium.
 That's
 why
 you
 sell


it.
 You're
 getting
 an
 insurance
 premium,


so
 to
 speak.
 But
 then
 to
 manage
 the


position
 you
 have
 to
 delta
 hedge.
 But


delta
 hedging
 means
 that
 you
 have
 to
 buy


and
 sell
 the
 underlying
 asset
 and
 some


higher
 order
 Greeks
 as
 well.
 Gamma,


Vega,
 theta
 that
 you've
 all
 read
 about.


But
 delta
 hedging
 requires
 people
 to
 be


able
 to
 buy
 and
 sell
 so
 that
 they
 are


the
 seller.
 The
 market
 maker
 is
 locally


flat
 of
 course.
 So
 the
 market
 maker


that's
 what
 you
 do
 and
 that's
 how
 you


earn
 your
 keep
 earn
 your
 fees
 so
 to


speak.
 The
 problem
 is
 that
 there's
 an


idealization
 in
 mathematics
 or


mathematical
 finance
 that
 you
 can
 do


this
 at
 an
 unlimited
 size
 and
 size


doesn't
 matter
 but
 it
 matters.
 Liquidity


is
 actually
 not
 there.
 The
 basic


assumption
 of
 black
 shores
 is
 that
 you


can
 continuously
 trade
 with
 almost
 zero


transactions
 costs.
 Well,
 that's
 just


not
 true
 in
 real
 markets.
 As
 a
 matter
 of


fact,
 in
 the
 last
 maybe
 two
 years
 even,


you've
 seen
 liquidity
 in
 the
 E-
 mini


futures
 contracts,
 which
 are
 possibly


the
 I
 would
 say
 the
 zeroth
 order
 hedging


instrument
 for
 the
 equity
 markets
 go


down
 relative
 to
 the
 high
 levels


frequently
 go
 down
 to
 maybe
 120th
 or


150th
 of
 it
 level.
 So
 people
 just
 can't


get
 out.
 So
 what
 happens
 is
 that
 people


sell
 options
 then
 they
 start
 delta


hedging.
 Delta
 hedging
 results
 in
 the


options
 market
 reacting
 to
 the
 delta


then
 results
 in
 new
 hedges
 coming
 in.
 So


this
 feedback
 loop
 gets
 tighter
 and


tighter
 and
 tighter
 until
 something


breaks.
 And
 when
 something
 breaks
 and


the
 bot
 shut
 down,
 which
 is
 today's


environment,


>> you
 actually
 have
 no
 liquidity.
 And


that's
 when
 you
 get
 these
 crashes
 like


Liberation
 Day
 on
 April
 2nd.


>> Volageddon
 was
 definitely
 one
 of
 the


more
 weirder
 events
 in
 markets
 because


everyone
 could
 see
 what
 was
 going
 to


happen
 when
 the
 VIX
 curve
 actually


inverted.
 like
 you
 could
 see
 that
 all


these
 products
 were
 going
 to
 go


absolutely
 belly
 up
 and
 no
 one
 no
 one


seemed
 to
 react
 to
 it
 until
 it
 was
 like


much
 too
 late.
 That
 reminds
 me.
 So,
 one


of
 the
 reasons
 that
 we
 are
 interviewing


you
 here
 in
 Huntington
 Beach
 is
 because


you
 used
 to
 work
 at
 Pimco
 with
 Bill


Gross.
 And
 the
 last
 time
 we
 spoke
 to


Bill
 Gross,
 I
 think
 was
 actually
 at


Huntington
 Beach
 two
 years
 ago.
 And
 one


of
 the
 things
 we
 spoke
 to
 him
 about
 was


volatility
 selling.


>> And
 Bill
 kind
 of
 became
 the
 poster
 child


for
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 volatility
 selling


at
 least
 in
 the
 bond
 market
 in
 the
 sort


of
 like
 guess
 it
 would
 have
 been
 2015


around
 then,
 mid
 sort
 of
 2010s
 area.
 I'm


really
 curious
 who's
 selling
 V
 now
 and


how
 has
 it
 changed
 over
 the
 course
 of


your
 career?


>> Yeah,
 so
 great
 uh
 little
 side
 point


there.
 So
 Bill
 and
 I've
 been
 great


friends
 as
 a
 matter
 of
 fact
 I
 went
 to


Pimco
 because
 I
 heard
 Bill
 speak
 at
 a


talk
 when
 he
 was
 advertising
 in
 book


back
 in
 2000
 and
 Bill's
 an
 amazing


genius,
 great
 investor.
 And
 one
 of
 the


best
 compliments
 I
 got
 recently,
 I
 was


communicating
 with
 him
 and
 he
 said,
 "I


have
 your
 paper
 at
 the
 top
 of
 my
 reading


list."
 And
 I
 said, "Which
 paper,
 Bill?"


and
 he
 said
 this
 paper
 that
 I
 wrote
 with


Larry
 Harris
 on
 the
 volatility
 selling


ecosystem
 that
 basically
 you
 grew
 up


before
 2018.
 So
 yes,
 so
 Bill
 actually
 in


in
 a
 sense
 invented
 this
 whole
 idea
 of


selling
 volatility
 in
 fixed
 income


especially
 through
 buying
 mortgages
 or


explicit
 selling
 of
 straddles
 and


strangles.
 And
 what
 we
 realized
 and


again
 I
 was
 head
 of
 analytics
 at
 Pimco.


over
 the
 last
 over
 15
 years
 or
 so
 I
 was


there
 I
 got
 to
 see
 and
 help
 him
 manage


the
 quantitative
 risks
 of
 those


portfolios.
 We
 ended
 up
 educating
 a
 lot


of
 our
 clients
 at
 that
 time
 about


volatility
 selling
 harvesting
 vault


premiums
 and
 so
 on
 which
 did
 end
 up


adding
 quite
 a
 bit
 of
 as
 Bill
 calls
 it


structural
 alpha
 to
 the
 PIMCO
 portfolios


and
 you
 know
 20
 30
 40
 basis
 points
 every


year.
 What
 happened
 is
 that
 everybody


got
 educated
 and
 it
 became
 part
 of
 the


academic
 lore
 and
 everybody
 realized
 it.


There
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 crowding
 and
 it's
 a


little
 bit
 like
 selling
 insurance
 right


so
 when
 you
 find
 that
 one
 insurance


policy
 selling
 works
 then
 you
 say
 why


don't
 become
 multi-line
 insurance


provider
 so
 you
 start
 selling
 insurance


policy
 on
 everything
 and
 so
 what
 has


happened
 now
 over
 my
 career
 it
 have
 gone


from
 institutional
 selling
 where
 first


it
 was
 hedge
 funds
 then
 it
 was
 large


sophisticated
 mutual
 funds
 like
 pimco


who
 could
 actually
 still
 fit
 it
 inside


of
 the
 mutual
 fund
 complex
 because


selling
 naked
 options
 is
 not
 really


allowed
 unless
 you
 cash
 back
 it,


>> right?


>> And
 then
 over
 time
 it
 has
 now
 gone
 to


all
 the
 do-it-yourselfers.


So
 all
 the
 wealth
 offices
 and
 family


offices
 and
 large
 endowments
 and
 this


whole
 area
 what's
 uh
 which
 is
 now
 called


alternative
 risk
 premiums
 is
 based
 on


this
 idea


>> that
 you
 can
 go
 and
 sell
 volatility
 in


various
 forms
 explicit
 forms
 or
 implicit


forms


>> to
 generate
 income.
 So
 everybody's
 doing


it.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 the
 answer.
 everyone
 even


more
 people
 are
 doing.
 So
 when
 we
 see


alternative
 risk
 premia
 it's
 basically
 a


wall
 selling
 overlay
 is
 that
 it


>> yeah
 I
 mean
 you
 can
 make
 it
 more
 or
 less


sophisticated
 I
 mean
 it's
 a
 little
 bit


naive
 to
 say
 it's
 only
 wall
 selling
 but


wall
 selling
 is
 a
 very
 important


component
 of
 it
 and
 there
 were
 some


great
 papers
 by
 people
 from
 AQR
 who
 took


every
 asset
 class
 so
 equities
 bonds


credit
 foreign
 exchange
 and
 then
 also


sliced
 it
 down
 in
 various
 types
 of


strategy
 style
 and
 quality
 and
 momentum


and
 so
 on
 they
 made
 like
 a
 16x6
 matrix


and
 then
 they
 recreated
 did
 this
 what
 I


consider
 to
 be
 more
 sophisticated


sounding


>> ball
 selling
 but
 it
 really
 is
 false


selling
 and
 what
 people
 do
 just
 to
 to
 be


very
 clear
 is
 it's
 not
 just
 ball
 selling


they
 also
 layer
 on
 other
 things
 like


trend
 following
 on
 top
 of
 it


>> to
 create
 a
 counterbalance
 to
 the
 ball


selling
 because
 trend
 following
 is


naturally


>> a
 ball
 liking
 or
 ball
 long
 ball
 type
 of


strategy


[Music]


going
 back
 to
 I
 hadn't
 realized
 that


about
 the
 declining
 or
 the
 collapsing


liquidity
 within
 the
 e-
 mini
 futures
 but


is
 there
 some
 sort
 of
 I
 don't
 know
 law


of
 thermodynamics
 or
 something
 I
 don't


know if
 that's
 the
 term
 or
 that's
 the


analogy
 in
 markets
 where
 such
 that
 when


some
 instrument
 becomes
 the
 hedging


instrument
 of
 choice,
 the
 more
 popular


that
 gets,
 the
 less
 capacity
 there
 is


for
 liquidity
 in
 that
 instrument.
 Is


that
 sort
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 here?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 in
 this
 case,
 the
 e-
 mini


futures
 contract
 are
 basically
 a


speculation
 vehicle.
 They're
 a
 cash


equization
 vehicle.
 So,
 they
 serve
 a
 lot


of
 different
 purposes.
 But
 I
 think
 the


biggest
 thing
 that's
 going
 on
 here


>> is
 that
 starting
 maybe
 about
 10
 years


ago
 and
 somewhat
 surreptitiously,
 the


market
 morphed
 from
 human
 market
 makers.


So,
 when
 I
 started
 trading,
 it
 was
 human


market
 makers.
 I
 still
 remember
 when
 I


was,
 you
 know,
 in
 the
 1990s,
 Tommy


Baldwin
 on
 the
 pit
 of
 the
 CBOT
 floor,


Chicago
 border
 trade
 floor,
 you
 know,


you
 would
 do
 a
 trade
 and
 Tommy
 Baldwin


and
 he
 was
 legendary.
 Obviously,
 he


would
 lift
 his
 hand
 up
 and
 the
 market


would
 stop
 and
 turn
 and
 go
 the
 other


way.
 Human
 humans
 could
 do
 that.
 Yeah,


what
 has
 happened
 surficially
 or
 you


know
 very
 strangely
 over
 the
 last
 15
 or


10
 years
 maybe
 is
 that
 the
 human
 beings


have
 sort
 of
 left
 this
 market
 making


area
 and
 90
 plus%
 is
 being
 made
 by
 bots


and
 what
 bots
 know
 very
 well
 self-s


survival
 is
 extremely
 important
 to
 them


is
 as
 soon
 as
 they
 see
 a
 liquidity
 title


wave
 coming
 tsunami
 coming
 at
 them
 they


just
 get
 out
 of
 the
 way
 the
 liquidity


just
 becomes
 very
 episodic
 and
 Muhammad


Alaran
 used
 to
 call
 it
 latent
 illquidity


which
 is
 just
 the
 fixture
 of
 the
 markets


today.
 It
 looks
 liquid


>> and
 when
 you
 don't
 need
 it,
 it's
 there


but
 if
 you
 need
 it,
 it's
 not
 there.


>> So
 how
 do
 you
 actually
 deal
 with
 that
 as


a
 trader?


>> Yeah.
 So
 as
 a
 trader,
 so
 this
 comes
 back


to
 the
 role
 of
 options
 fundamentally,


right?
 So
 what
 do
 options
 I
 mean
 in
 the


world
 of
 quantitative
 finance,
 you
 can


take
 an
 option,
 you
 can
 replicate
 it
 by


doing
 delta
 hedging
 and
 so
 on.
 Basically


looking
 at
 the
 partial
 derivatives
 of
 an


option
 pricing
 equation
 or
 you
 can
 say


I'll
 just
 buy
 the
 option.
 So
 an
 option


is
 a
 contractual
 agreement
 between
 you


and
 the
 option
 provider.
 So
 if
 there's


ill
 liquidity
 and
 you
 believe
 this
 is
 a


fixture
 of
 the
 environment
 that
 we're


going
 to
 live
 in,
 then
 there
 is
 no
 other


way
 than
 to
 actually
 have
 a
 contractual


agreement
 with
 somebody


>> where
 you're
 delegating
 the
 uh


illquidity
 risk
 to
 them
 and
 so
 you
 are


buying
 it


>> when
 the
 premium
 is
 cheaper.
 But
 trying


to
 delta
 hedge
 it
 yourself
 is
 like


literally
 trying
 to
 you
 know
 put
 an


elephant
 through
 the
 eye
 of
 a
 needle.


There's
 just
 people
 just
 cannot
 work


out.
 I
 mean,
 I
 just
 can't


>> I
 just
 can't
 imagine
 the
 market


collectively
 trying
 to
 get
 through
 that


needle
 these
 days.


>> There
 is
 just
 nothing
 there.
 Let's
 talk


about
 April
 for
 a
 second
 and
 maybe
 that


period
 like
 between
 April
 2nd
 and
 April


9th
 because
 that
 was
 a
 a
 market
 event


for
 sure
 and
 it
 was
 also
 a
 real
 economic


event
 with
 many
 things
 going
 on
 that


weren't
 just
 lines
 on
 a
 chart
 etc.
 and


we
 know
 what
 sort
 of
 happened
 there
 with


the
 tariffs
 and
 then
 the
 reversal
 of


some
 of
 the
 tariffs
 and
 what
 so
 forth.


Since
 then,
 we've
 seen
 some
 of
 these


correlation
 breakdowns
 that
 some
 of
 our


previous
 guests
 have
 talked
 about.
 From


your
 perspective,
 you
 know,
 whether
 it's


April
 2nd
 through
 April
 9th
 or
 April
 2nd


through
 now,
 what
 happened
 then
 such


that
 maybe
 some
 maybe
 is
 it
 a
 new


regime?
 What
 changed
 in
 that
 month?
 Yeah


though
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 is


going
 on
 is
 we
 are
 slowly
 undergoing
 a


regime
 shift
 and
 I
 like
 to
 always
 paint


this
 picture
 and
 I'll
 come
 to
 your


question
 right
 after
 I
 give
 you
 this
 big


macro
 picture
 from
 the
 60s
 to
 the
 80s


60s
 to
 the
 mid
 80s
 you
 had
 this
 period


of
 rising
 inflation
 rising
 volatility


noncredible
 central
 banks
 and
 stuff
 was


kind
 of
 breaking
 and
 people
 were
 behind


the
 curve
 then
 you
 had
 the
 bulker


increase
 of
 interest
 rates
 starting
 in


the
 1980s
 and
 until
 the
 maybe
 late
 20s


2020
 call
 it
 2021
 on
 covid
 was
 an


accelerant
 you
 got
 negative
 yields
 and


falling
 volatility
 credible
 central


banks
 and
 so
 on
 and
 I
 think
 we've


actually
 turned
 the
 corner
 again
 so


starting
 in
 202021
 I
 think
 we
 are


probably
 going
 to
 look
 more
 like
 the
 60s


to
 80
 than
 1987
 to
 2020
 now
 having
 put


that
 backdrop
 you
 know
 in
 in
 front
 of
 us


I
 think
 the
 issue
 really
 comes
 back
 to


yes
 there
 is
 a
 regime
 shift
 both
 in


terms
 of
 people's
 response
 function
 and


how
 quickly
 things
 happen.
 So
 one
 data


point
 that
 I
 can
 relay
 is
 since
 I


started
 trading
 is
 in
 the
 past
 when


crisis
 were
 would
 happen
 even
 including


the
 GFC
 which
 I
 lived
 through
 and
 you


know
 did
 fairly
 well
 it
 used
 to
 take


months
 maybe
 weeks
 for
 things
 to
 correct


and
 you
 had
 time
 to
 plan
 and
 time
 to


execute.
 Then
 Volmageddon
 maybe
 took
 a


few
 days.
 2020
 COVID
 it
 maybe
 happened


in
 you
 know
 few
 days
 to
 few
 hours
 and


then
 starting
 this
 year
 it
 feels
 like


things
 are
 actually
 happening
 on
 an


hourly
 to
 maybe
 minute
 basis.
 For


instance
 in
 April
 when
 the
 you
 know
 big


crash
 happened
 and
 the
 correction


happened
 all
 the
 action
 including
 some


of
 our
 trading
 happened
 in
 the
 pre-
 pre


pre-market.
 So
 the
 markets
 had
 not
 even


opened
 up
 and
 if
 you
 needed
 to
 do


something
 you
 had
 to
 do
 it
 during
 the


night
 session
 because
 that's
 where
 all


the
 action
 was.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 one


fixture
 what's
 going
 on
 right
 now
 is


that
 stuff
 is
 happening
 much
 faster
 and


it
 does
 feel
 like
 the
 balance
 is
 tilted


in
 the
 favor
 of
 more
 automated
 trading


rather
 than
 human-driven
 trading.
 Let
 me


ask
 a
 philosophical
 question
 about
 tail


risk
 projection,
 which
 is
 whenever


there's
 a
 blow
 up,
 we
 suddenly
 get
 all


these
 stories
 about
 tail
 risk
 funds
 that


have
 done
 phenomenally
 well
 out
 of
 last


month's
 chaos
 or
 whatever
 it
 might
 be.


And
 then
 no
 one
 talks
 about
 them
 for


like
 the
 next
 three
 years.


>> You
 don't
 know
 how
 they're
 bleeding
 you


dry
 during
 those
 other
 months,
 right?


>> That's
 right.
 Um
 until
 we
 get
 another


blow
 up
 and
 then
 the
 cycle
 repeats


itself.
 In
 your
 mind,
 what
 is
 the


purpose
 of
 tail
 risk
 protection?
 Yeah,


this
 is
 very
 simple
 and
 I've
 been
 trying


to
 do
 this.
 This
 is
 actually
 one
 of
 my


mission
 since
 I
 started
 our
 firm
 is
 not


just
 managing
 the
 risk
 but
 also
 trying


to
 educate
 people
 on
 what
 the
 purpose


is.
 The
 purpose
 is
 very
 similar
 to


insurance
 and
 not
 everybody
 needs
 it.
 If


you
 don't
 live
 in
 California
 earthquake


prone
 zone
 or
 in
 Florida
 hurricane
 prone


zone,
 you
 don't
 need
 the
 insurance.
 But


if
 you're
 going
 to
 run
 a
 large


equityheavy
 portfolio,
 and
 by
 the
 way,


equities
 have
 demonstrated
 over
 the
 last


100
 years
 and
 maybe
 going
 forward
 are


the
 one
 way
 to
 create
 long-term
 wealth


because
 people
 go
 to
 work.
 The
 first


thing
 I
 learned
 when
 I
 was
 at
 City
 Bank


from
 my
 boss
 told
 me
 was
 just
 look
 at


log
 GDP
 versus
 log
 S&P.
 The
 charts
 are


aligned.
 Basically,
 if
 people
 work,
 the


market
 goes
 up.
 So,
 what
 that
 means
 is


that
 you
 need
 to
 be
 invested
 in
 the


stock
 market.
 And
 the
 more
 you
 invest
 in


the
 stock
 market,
 the
 more
 likely
 it
 is


that
 you're
 going
 to
 make
 higher


compounded
 returns
 over
 time.
 But
 also,


you
 will
 suffer
 big
 draw
 downs.
 And
 one


of
 the
 biggest
 problems
 with
 people's


behavioral
 function
 is
 that
 when
 the


markets
 collapse,
 they
 forget
 their


plans
 and
 they
 liquidate.
 Right?
 So
 what


tail
 risk
 fundamentally
 does,
 it's
 not
 a


fund
 that
 you
 should
 look
 in
 isolation


and
 say,
 is
 this
 fund
 a
 good
 performer


or
 not?
 Just
 like
 you
 would
 not
 go
 back


home
 and
 say,
 "Well,
 what
 the
 what
 was


the
 total
 return
 on
 my
 home
 insurance


policy?"


>> Right?
 It's
 just
 a
 positive
 negative


100%.
 Right?
 Every
 single
 year.
 So,


would
 you
 quit
 buying
 insurance?
 You


won't
 because
 home
 insurance
 or
 car


insurance
 is
 not
 an
 investment.
 It
 is


the
 cost
 of
 doing
 business.
 So
 that's


the
 context
 in
 which
 one
 should
 think


about
 tail
 risk
 hedging
 is
 it
 allows
 you


to
 first
 protect
 yourself
 from
 yourself


in
 the
 bad
 events
 and
 then
 secondly
 when


the
 markets
 are
 down


>> the
 value
 of
 those
 hedges
 going
 up


allows
 you
 to
 buy
 assets
 on
 the
 sheep


which
 results
 in
 compounded
 growth.


>> Why
 hasn't
 Wall
 Street
 created
 an


instrument
 where
 you
 could
 sell
 away


your
 liquidity
 to
 protect
 you
 from


yourself
 automatically?
 I'm
 going
 to


invest
 in
 this
 fund
 and
 I
 cannot
 sell


until
 the
 year60.


>> Isn't
 that
 called
 lockups?


>> But
 do
 those
 funds
 actually
 exist?
 Could


I
 buy
 that?
 And
 then
 there's
 two
 things


that
 intuitively
 seem
 that
 A
 you
 protect


yourself
 from
 yourself.
 B,
 you
 diversify


automatically
 by
 the
 fact
 that
 you're


across
 time
 and
 then
 C
 presumably
 that


would
 be
 more
 stable
 for
 securities


lending
 and
 collect
 the
 little


instrument.
 Has
 Wall
 Street
 created
 a


fund
 that
 one
 can't
 get
 out
 of?
 I
 think


like
 Tracy
 just
 mentioned
 uh
 hedge
 funds


like
 to
 have
 lockups
 and
 and
 this


>> I
 just
 I
 should
 just
 be
 able
 to
 buy
 an


ETF
 that
 I
 can't
 sell.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 I
 think
 the
 if
 you
 can
 get
 over


the
 regulators
 I
 think
 that
 we
 are


living
 in
 a
 world
 where
 Marktomarket


daily
 NAV
 etc
 for
 ETFs
 and
 full


transparency
 is
 required.
 But
 I
 do
 think


I
 mean
 one
 one
 very
 sophisticated


institutional
 investor
 who
 was
 a
 client


of
 ours
 actually
 said
 I
 would
 pay
 you


more
 if
 you
 sold
 me
 a
 product
 that


actually
 had
 a
 longer
 lock.
 because
 this


is
 a
 question
 I
 have
 about
 portfolios


and
 diversification
 in
 general
 and
 it


goes
 back
 to
 the
 point
 that
 you
 made


about
 how
 stocks
 have
 done
 very
 well
 and


the
 expectation
 is
 that
 as
 long
 as
 the


economy
 grows
 stocks
 will
 continue
 to
 do


well
 for
 a
 while
 6040
 was
 a
 craze
 right


and
 this
 was
 a
 good
 portfolio
 of
 your


treasuries
 and
 your
 stocks
 balance
 out


but
 why
 should
 like
 what
 is
 the
 case
 for


diversification
 let's
 say
 setting
 aside


the
 behavioral
 fact
 that
 people
 sell
 at


the
 lows


What
 is
 the
 case
 for
 diversification


when
 there
 is
 this
 asset
 class
 that
 does


so
 well
 over
 time?


>> Yeah,
 so
 this
 is
 great.
 So
 if
 you
 could


guarantee
 that
 this
 asset
 class
 would


keep
 growing
 always
 then
 you
 would
 100%


be
 on
 stock
 only.


>> Now
 what
 bonds
 traditionally
 used
 to
 do


was
 they
 provided
 you
 with
 income
 that


when
 the
 stock
 market
 wasn't
 doing
 well


at least
 you
 wouldn't
 go
 completely


broke
 because
 you
 would
 have
 some
 yield.


>> But
 I
 think
 it
 got
 taken
 to
 an
 extreme


right.
 I
 mean
 the
 greatest
 example
 and
 I


wrote
 a
 whole
 book
 on
 this
 topic
 is
 is


the
 European
 Central
 Bank
 followed
 the


Japanese
 central
 bank
 and
 then
 they


started
 buying
 at
 negative
 yields
 and


they
 convinced
 all
 the
 indexers
 to
 keep


buying
 bonds
 with
 them.
 Right?
 I
 mean


think
 about
 this.
 You
 were
 buying
 bonds


meaning
 you
 were
 lending
 somebody
 money


and
 you
 were
 paying
 them
 interest


>> and
 at
 that
 point
 diversification
 is
 an


insult.
 I
 mean
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 buy
 a


negatively
 yielding
 bond
 along
 with


stocks
 because
 it
 does
 nothing
 for
 you.


And
 we're
 living
 the
 consequences
 of
 it


today
 because
 the
 bond
 market
 over
 the


last
 five
 or
 seven
 or
 10
 years
 even
 has


had
 absolutely
 dismal
 zero
 returns.


>> Joe,
 do
 you
 think
 people
 who
 want


positive
 yielding
 bonds
 are
 entitled


still?
 That
 was
 your
 position
 for
 a


whole
 year.


>> I
 still
 think
 that
 I
 still
 don't
 think


anyone
 is
 entitled
 to
 yield.


>> No,
 I
 don't.
 If
 you
 want
 to
 take
 the


risk,
 go
 get
 it.
 But
 the
 sort
 of
 moral


demands
 that
 the
 government
 must
 provide


you
 yield
 for
 what?
 For
 not
 spending
 and


doing
 anything.
 Give
 me
 a
 break.
 Joe
 Joe


spent
 a
 good
 year
 making
 fun
 of
 yield


bugs
 as
 you
 call
 them.


>> I
 don't
 It's
 great.
 Go
 out,
 collect
 your


yield.
 I'm
 I'm
 happy
 for
 you,
 but
 don't


pretend
 that
 it's
 some
 sort
 of
 moral


insult
 that
 the
 government
 isn't


providing
 you
 risk-free
 yield.
 That
 is


my
 only
 That
 is
 my
 only
 stamp.


>> That's
 I
 would
 argue
 the
 US
 government's


most
 important
 role.
 Anyway,
 let's
 go


back
 for
 a
 second.
 So,
 it's
 not
 just
 the


insurance
 idea.
 you
 touched
 on
 this,
 but


it's
 also
 the
 idea
 that
 like
 you
 can
 get


a
 massive
 windfall
 when
 there's
 a
 market


crash
 and
 then
 you
 can
 use
 that
 money
 to


actually
 go
 on
 a
 buying
 spree
 at
 a
 time


when
 markets
 are
 cheap
 and
 everyone
 else


is,
 you
 know,
 short
 on
 cash
 and
 they


can't
 do
 the
 same.
 How
 do
 you
 actually


deploy
 that
 into
 practice
 and
 how
 do
 you


scale
 for
 instance
 an
 expected
 windfall


against
 the
 type
 of
 assets
 that
 you


could
 potentially
 buy?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 this
 this
 is
 where
 the


first
 principles
 thinking
 becomes
 really


important.
 So
 you
 have
 to
 look
 at
 every


portfolio
 is
 different,
 right?
 So
 one
 of


the
 other
 mistakes
 I
 think
 people
 make


is
 they
 think
 you
 can
 just
 pick
 up
 a


finance
 101
 book
 and
 say
 every
 portfolio


is
 identical.
 It's
 all
 risk
 neutral
 and


everybody
 is
 exactly
 the
 same.
 It's
 just


not
 the
 case.
 Public
 fund
 that
 has
 a
 40%


or
 50%
 funded
 ratio
 is
 very
 different


than
 a
 90%
 or
 a
 you
 know
 bank
 that's


120%
 fully
 funded.
 Right?
 So
 everybody


has
 different
 needs.
 The
 first
 thing


that
 you
 do
 is
 you
 look
 at
 the


underlying
 portfolio's
 posture.
 How
 much


loss
 can
 you
 take?
 look
 at
 the
 systemic


risk
 shocks
 that
 they
 can
 actually


withstand.
 So
 you
 run
 a
 shock,
 you
 run
 a


full
 distribution
 analysis
 and
 figure


out
 what
 is
 the
 outcome
 under
 which
 they


will
 be
 under
 so
 much
 distress
 or
 so


much
 duress
 that
 they
 might
 end
 up


having
 to
 liquidate
 assets.
 And
 there


are
 actually
 quite
 a
 few
 like
 that
 right


now
 where
 if
 the
 stock
 market
 went
 down


20%.
 And
 privates
 went
 down
 about
 20%.


>> In
 order
 to
 raise
 liquidity
 for


distribution,
 they
 would
 have
 to


actually
 sell
 seed
 corn,
 right?
 So
 it's


really
 really
 bad.
 So
 that's
 an


existential
 risk
 that
 you
 want
 to


quantify.
 So
 the
 first
 thing
 that
 you
 do


is
 you
 figure
 out
 what
 that
 risk
 is.
 A


full
 distribution
 of
 outcomes
 and
 then


you
 look
 at
 the
 instrument
 set
 that's


out
 there
 in
 the
 marketplace
 starting


from
 the
 most
 reliable
 and
 surprisingly


enough
 like
 Joe
 mentioned
 already
 the


cheapest
 one
 which
 is
 equity
 option


volatility.
 M


>> you
 can
 buy
 those
 put
 options
 but
 people


who
 are
 not
 willing
 to
 pay
 a
 lot
 of


continuous
 premium
 you
 can
 do
 more


sophisticated
 tricks
 where
 you
 can
 buy


indirect
 hedges
 for
 instance
 credit


default
 swaps
 today
 the
 CDX
 index
 if
 you


don't
 see
 the
 charts
 it's
 actually


tighter
 than
 it
 was
 pre
 the
 GFC
 it's
 the


tightest
 it's
 ever
 been


>> because
 people
 are
 buying
 it
 for


cosmetic
 yield
 reasons
 so
 there
 are
 a


lot
 of
 derivative
 inst
 cosmetic
 yield


simply
 means
 that
 the
 total
 yield
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 yield
 of
 a
 corporate
 bond


today.


>> It
 is
 basically
 treasury
 yield
 plus
 some


spreads.
 So
 the
 treasury
 yields
 are
 at


call
 it
 4
 and a
 half
 4%.


>> But
 the
 spreads
 are
 actually
 very
 tight


only
 50
 basis
 points
 on
 the
 CDX.
 So


you're
 getting
 a
 5%
 6%
 yield


>> which
 in
 the
 context
 of
 where
 we
 were
 3


years
 ago
 looks
 like
 an


issue.


You
 are
 taking
 much
 risk.


>> Okay,
 keep
 going.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 a
 cosmetic
 yield.
 Your


decorated
 yield.
 So
 to
 me
 the
 yield
 is


not
 justified
 by
 the
 risks
 that
 are


underlyed.
 So
 there's
 various


instruments
 that
 you
 can
 use
 and
 create


a
 portfolio
 of
 these
 types
 of
 hedges.


[Music]


Is
 tailor
 risk
 hedging
 like
 insurance


from
 a
 business
 from
 a
 structure
 of
 how


people
 buy
 it?
 Is
 it
 like
 insurance


where
 people
 sort
 of
 reload
 every
 year


in
 a
 sort
 of
 okay
 start
 of
 the
 new
 year


what
 is
 the
 tail
 risk
 I
 want
 to
 put
 on


etc
 or
 something
 that
 renews
 and
 they


have
 to
 keep
 paying
 a
 fee
 or
 is
 it
 just


sort
 of
 something
 that
 can
 be
 set
 it
 and


forget
 it
 a
 permanent
 allocation
 that


sort
 of
 the
 tail
 risk
 hedge
 like
 talk
 to


us
 about
 the
 business
 of
 selling
 a
 tail


risk
 hedge


>> yeah
 so
 definitely
 so
 it
 goes
 up
 to
 the


highest
 level
 where
 this
 becomes
 part
 of


where
 you
 guys
 started
 portfolio


construction
 it's
 an
 asset
 allocation


decision
 Yeah,


>> it's
 not
 a
 trade.
 So
 the
 context
 has
 to


be
 that
 if
 the
 agents
 are
 all
 lined
 up,


meaning
 boards
 and
 trustees
 and
 so
 on,


they
 think
 of
 this
 decision
 as


protecting
 the
 portfolio,
 making
 a
 more


robust
 portfolio
 as
 part
 of
 the
 DNA
 and


the
 tail
 becomes
 part
 of
 the
 how
 you


rebalance
 your
 portfolio
 over
 the
 long


term.
 Okay.
 So
 that's
 how
 you
 set
 up
 the


strategic
 portfolio.
 But
 then
 to
 your


point,
 every
 year,
 yes,
 you
 have
 to


renew
 this
 policy.
 You
 re
 have
 to


recommmit
 premiums.
 Now
 you
 can
 preund


for
 the
 next
 5
 years
 if
 you
 wanted
 to


>> but
 because
 options
 decay


>> in
 order
 to
 have
 this
 reliable
 hedge
 you


sort
 of
 have
 to
 uh
 buy
 new
 options.


>> Yes.


>> What
 would
 be
 the
 worst
 kind
 of
 tail


risk
 hedging
 in
 your
 view?
 Is
 it
 you


know
 too
 expensive
 or
 does
 it
 not


actually
 work
 when
 there
 is
 a
 big
 market


crash?
 Like
 what
 is
 the
 ultimate
 sin
 of


a
 tail
 risk
 strategy?


>> Ultimate
 sin
 absolutely
 is
 the
 one
 which


promises
 to
 work
 but
 doesn't
 work.


Right.
 So
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 try
 to
 reduce


your
 cost
 by
 creating
 synthetic


strategies,
 right?
 I
 already
 mentioned


futures
 markets
 aren't
 very
 deep
 when


you
 need
 them,
 but
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


strategies
 which
 actually
 use
 a
 futures


replication
 strategy


>> like
 the
 1987
 crash
 also
 purported
 to


do.
 And
 those
 strategies
 typically
 don't


work.
 And
 so
 there's
 many
 that
 promise


and
 they
 look
 like
 they
 are
 cheaper
 and


they
 don't
 cost
 any
 bleed
 but
 they
 also


do
 not
 deliver
 which
 again
 going
 back
 to


April
 2nd
 the
 only
 thing
 that
 worked


during
 that
 April
 2nd
 to
 April
 8th


period
 was
 reliable
 hedging
 using
 index


options
 nothing
 duration
 didn't
 work


trend
 following
 didn't
 work
 a
 lot
 of


other
 altruis
 premium
 strategies
 didn't


work


>> so
 that
 is
 the
 cardinal
 sin
 you
 just
 do


not
 do
 not
 have
 the
 luxury
 to
 go
 to
 the


constituent
 and
 your
 clients
 or


whoever's
 bought
 it
 and
 said,
 you
 know,


we
 were
 trying
 to
 be
 too
 smart
 and
 oops,


it
 didn't
 work.


>> Yeah.


>> As
 you
 mentioned
 that
 to
 even
 talk
 about


buying
 a
 tail
 risk
 hedge,
 you
 have
 to


sort
 of
 understand
 is
 what
 is
 the


existential
 risk
 for
 the
 fund
 and


different
 funds
 have
 different
 flavors


of
 existential
 risk
 depending
 on
 how


funded
 they
 are.
 And
 so
 obviously
 an


entity
 that's
 120%
 funded
 is
 going
 to


have
 very
 different
 risk
 scenarios
 than


one
 that's
 40%
 funded.
 But
 you
 said


something
 interesting
 which
 is
 that
 and


I've
 been
 thinking
 about
 this
 a
 lot
 in
 a


different
 context
 which
 is
 how
 levered


is
 the
 financial
 system
 or
 the
 real


economy
 to
 an
 ongoing
 rise
 in
 the
 stock


market?
 How
 important
 is
 that?
 And
 at


what
 point
 does
 even
 a
 sideways
 stock


market,
 let
 alone
 a
 decline
 become
 risky


for
 something
 that
 could
 break?
 And
 you


know,
 we
 used
 to
 think
 credit
 is
 the


thing
 that
 breaks.
 But
 I
 wonder
 if
 it's


in
 the
 stock
 area
 thing
 now
 where
 you


really
 get
 the
 problem
 if
 the
 equity


values
 don't
 go
 up.
 Tell
 us
 more
 about


what
 you
 said
 about
 what
 happens
 to


various
 types
 of
 economically
 important


players.
 If
 the
 stock
 market
 one
 day


stops
 going
 up
 for
 uh
 sustained
 period


of
 time,


>> I
 think
 you
 have
 a
 big
 problem,
 right?


So,
 so
 not
 only
 is
 the
 stock
 the
 whole


system
 401ks
 and
 public
 pensions,


they're
 all
 levered
 up
 to
 the
 stock


market
 because
 that's
 the
 only
 way
 you


can
 get
 to
 your
 7
 12
 or
 8%
 actual
 yield.


So,
 if
 the
 stock
 market
 doesn't
 keep


going
 up
 and
 keep
 delivering
 those
 kind


of
 returns,
 it's
 very
 hard
 to
 get
 to


that
 point.
 Maybe
 if
 inflation
 rises,
 at


least
 again
 cosmetically,
 maybe
 the
 long


bond
 gets
 up
 to
 7%
 or
 8%.
 And
 everybody


can
 just
 lock
 it
 in
 and
 immunize
 and


you're
 there.


>> But
 in
 real
 terms,
 you're
 not
 going
 to


have
 the
 income
 that
 you
 need
 30
 years


from
 now
 to
 retire.


>> I'm
 fine.
 I
 have a
 zer
 mortgage.
 So
 I
 I


have
 I
 have
 a
 mortgage
 that's
 locked
 in


from
 that
 one
 period
 of
 time.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 So
 the
 system
 is
 very


levered.
 And
 then
 corporate
 credit


clearly
 is
 very
 very
 concentrated.
 We


all
 read
 about
 payings
 and
 so
 on.
 But


corporate
 credit
 based
 on
 the
 merrenton


model
 again
 that
 connects
 equities


>> to
 corporate
 credit
 spreads
 is
 also


leveraged
 the
 stock
 market.
 that
 the


stock
 market
 suddenly
 had
 a
 big


sell-off,
 corporate
 credits
 widen
 out,


which
 is
 the
 real
 problem,
 right?


Because
 if
 corporate
 credit
 widens
 out


and
 the
 cost
 of
 borrowing
 goes
 up
 for


all
 the
 corporations,
 maybe
 not
 the
 fang


stocks,
 but
 the
 493
 other
 stocks,
 then


how
 does
 the
 system
 produce?
 Because
 our


whole
 system
 is
 based
 on
 borrowing.
 And


I
 don't
 think
 very
 many
 companies
 in
 the


US
 can
 function
 if
 your
 cost
 of


operating
 your
 business
 was
 10%
 a
 year.


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 Well,
 on
 that
 note,
 we
 would


be
 remiss
 to
 have
 a
 tail
 risk
 person


here
 and
 not
 ask
 what's
 the
 big
 risk


that
 you
 see
 on
 the
 horizon
 in
 let's


just
 say
 the
 short
 to
 medium
 term.


>> I
 think
 for
 me
 the
 biggest
 risk
 right


now
 is
 uh
 what
 people
 have
 been
 talking


about
 is
 you
 know
 the
 so-called
 and
 I


call
 it
 so-called
 the
 Fed
 independence


paradigm
 shift
 because
 I
 don't
 believe


the
 Fed
 was
 ever
 really
 fully


independent
 but
 now
 it's
 coming
 to
 the


four
 that
 the
 fiscal
 and
 monetary


authorities
 are
 actually
 one.
 So
 what


happens
 in
 the
 aftermath
 if
 the
 Fed


actually
 becomes
 part
 of
 the
 central


government,
 the
 fiscal
 authorities,
 I


think
 at
 that
 point
 all
 bets
 are
 off


because
 that's
 the
 one
 anchor
 that


everybody
 whether
 uh
 realistically
 or


not
 has
 held
 on
 to.
 But
 if
 interest


rates
 can
 change
 just
 based
 on
 the
 need


to
 finance
 something
 that
 totally
 upside


downs
 the
 financial
 system.
 So
 to
 me


that's
 the
 single
 biggest
 risk
 right


now.
 So
 would
 that
 materialize
 into
 an


inflationary
 risk
 for
 instance
 and
 then


would
 you
 be
 focused
 on
 what
 you
 can
 do


to
 offset
 that?


>> Yeah,
 inflationary
 risk
 and
 I
 think
 one


of
 the
 best
 option
 trades
 again
 this
 is


not
 a
 direct
 option.
 So
 going
 back
 to


what
 you
 were
 asking
 before
 you
 don't


always
 just
 have
 to
 pay
 premium
 the


yield
 curve
 steepener
 where
 you
 buy
 the


short
 end
 of
 the
 yield
 curve
 and
 you


sell
 the
 long
 end
 of
 the
 yield
 curve.


Today
 you
 can
 do
 it
 through
 using
 swaps


and
 all
 that
 for
 essentially
 zero
 net


carry.
 So
 here's
 an
 option
 very
 similar


to
 shorting
 the
 negatively
 bond
 market


in
 Europe
 a
 few
 years
 ago
 where
 if
 you


put
 a
 yield
 curve
 steepener
 on


>> either
 in
 a
 hyperinflationary
 maybe
 not


hyper
 but
 a
 lot
 high
 inflationary


scenario
 or
 in
 an
 aggressive
 Fed
 cut
 the


yield
 curve
 steepens.
 So
 yes,
 so
 that


environment
 is
 an
 environment
 in
 which


the
 curve
 steepener
 could
 work.
 And
 yes,


my
 zeroth
 order
 prior
 forecast
 would
 be


that
 if
 we
 lose
 explicit
 independence
 of


the
 Fed,
 the
 yield
 curve
 actually


steepens
 a
 lot
 more.


>> Something
 I'm
 interested
 in.
 So,
 you


know,
 you
 were
 talking
 about
 the
 recent


eras
 and
 the
 the
 60s
 and
 80s
 and
 things


may
 have
 gotten
 a
 little
 unglued
 and


then
 the
 Vulkar
 era
 and
 then
 the


postcoid
 era
 and
 now
 this
 question
 about


whether
 what's
 left
 of
 Fed
 independence


is
 at
 risk.
 You
 know,
 you're
 a
 physicist


and
 or
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 in
 your
 space
 are


mathematicians.
 Is
 there
 a
 limit
 to
 how


much
 you
 can
 sort
 of
 math
 it
 out
 so
 to


speak?
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 questions


are
 external
 to
 mathematics
 and
 so
 how


do
 you
 think
 about
 the
 limits
 of


quantitative
 analysis
 when
 we're
 dealing


with
 things
 like
 will
 the
 political


system
 allow
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 to


remain
 independent?
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 a
 lot


of
 it
 is
 actually
 non-quantitative
 and


what
 I've
 learned
 even
 though
 I
 come


from
 a
 quantitative
 background,
 it's
 not


the
 math
 itself,
 but
 it's
 the
 sequence


of
 logical
 arguments
 that
 you
 can
 make


to
 get
 to
 a
 conclusion.
 Right?
 So
 for


instance,
 we
 knew
 even
 before
 fancy


mathematics
 was
 discovered
 uh
 you
 know


lrangeians
 and
 so
 on
 that
 gravity


exists.
 Gravity's
 existence
 has
 been


known
 before
 maybe
 math
 was
 invented
 but


gravity
 has
 been
 there
 and
 so
 I
 think


there's
 some
 central
 laws
 of
 finance


which
 will
 still
 continue
 to
 exist
 uh


regardless
 of
 the
 mathematical
 modeling


of
 them
 and
 you
 know
 the
 bill
 gross
 when


I
 used
 to
 work
 with
 him
 he
 used
 to
 say


some
 things
 we
 can
 take
 for
 granted
 I'm


paraphrasing
 it
 but
 the
 steepness
 of
 the


yield
 curve
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 yield


curve
 needs
 to
 be
 upward
 sloped
 for
 the


financial
 system
 to
 function
 because


people
 lend
 money
 in
 order
 to
 get


something
 in
 turn.
 Those
 are
 not


mathematical
 devices.
 Those
 are
 really


just
 the
 way
 the
 capitalist
 system


works.
 So
 I
 think
 you
 can
 take
 the


quantitative
 modeling
 to
 its
 own
 limit.


But
 there
 are
 certain
 things
 that
 have


happened
 in
 our
 system
 where
 we're
 at
 a


point
 now
 where
 gravity
 so
 to
 speak
 of


the
 financial
 markets
 are
 going
 to
 have


to
 take
 over.


>> But
 presumably
 also
 if
 you
 can't
 predict


the
 politics
 because
 it's
 very
 difficult


especially
 nowadays.
 If
 you
 can't


predict
 the
 politics
 then
 maybe
 right


sizing
 your
 positions
 becomes
 more


important.
 And
 so
 the
 maths
 actually


becomes
 one
 way
 of
 dealing
 with
 the
 very


uncertainty
 non-mmathematical
 element
 of


what's
 going
 on.


>> Yeah.
 Exactly.
 And
 I
 think
 to
 take
 that


point
 one
 step
 further.
 So
 correlation


has
 been
 the
 greatest
 gift
 since
 the
 19


mid
 80s
 to
 to
 2020.
 Right.
 So
 you
 got


stocks
 and
 bonds
 just
 say
 6040.
 Stocks


went
 up,
 bonds
 went
 up
 and
 they
 were


diversifying
 which
 is
 what
 a
 beautiful


place
 to
 be
 in.
 Right.
 It


>> sounds
 nice.
 So
 so
 that
 was
 a
 freebie.


And
 again
 this
 goes
 back
 to
 financial


gravity
 so
 to
 speak
 that
 state
 of


affairs
 that
 free
 lunch
 should
 not


exist.
 So
 I
 think
 we
 might
 be
 entering
 a


phase
 where
 stocks
 and
 bonds
 maybe
 are


actually
 not
 diversifying
 and
 you
 have


to
 look
 at
 other
 things.
 Gold
 of
 course


as
 you
 mentioned
 maybe
 Bitcoin
 who
 knows


but
 I
 think
 the
 fact
 that
 reliable


insurance
 or
 portfolio
 protection
 is
 so


available
 today
 using
 the
 options
 market


to
 me
 would
 be
 the
 place
 where
 I
 would


look.
 When
 you
 look
 at
 the
 long
 end
 of


the
 yield
 curve
 today
 in
 the
 US,
 is


there
 an
 element
 in
 which
 these
 concerns


about
 the
 loss
 of
 Fed
 independence
 are


being
 priced
 in
 right
 now?
 If
 suddenly


you
 could
 snap
 your
 finger
 and
 know
 for


a
 fact
 that
 the
 Fed
 will
 operate
 as
 it


has
 been
 for
 the
 last
 20
 years,
 for
 the


next
 20
 years,
 would
 there
 be
 a
 change?


Is
 there
 some
 margin
 that
 concern
 there?


You
 know what?
 I
 don't
 know if
 the
 Fed


is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 committed
 inflation


fighter
 as
 well
 as
 it
 has
 been
 in
 the


past.
 Therefore,
 I'm
 demanding
 extra


yield
 today.


>> No,
 not
 yet.
 I
 don't
 think
 so.
 Maybe
 a


slight
 amount
 of
 premium
 has
 gone
 up.


But
 one
 of
 the
 most
 striking
 features
 of


the
 system
 is
 that
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


Treasury
 yields,
 look
 at
 the
 30-year


bond
 today
 is
 470.
 But
 you
 look
 at
 the


30-year
 interest
 rate
 swap,
 it's
 trading


at,
 believe
 it
 or
 not,
 389,
 right?
 So,


it's
 almost
 85
 basis
 points
 under
 the
 US


Treasury.
 Now,
 you
 ask,
 why
 would


somebody
 take
 the
 uh
 swap
 market
 at
 a


lower
 yield?
 And
 I've
 been
 trading
 swaps


since
 its
 inception
 back
 in
 the
 1990s.


Swap
 spreads
 are
 negative
 85.
 And
 that


goes
 back
 to
 the
 receiving
 of
 interest


rate
 swaps
 to
 hedge
 liabilities
 by
 a
 lot


of
 large
 institutions.
 So
 they
 have


certainly
 not
 priced
 in
 inflationary


effects
 into
 the
 swap
 market.


>> But
 at
 some
 point
 this
 has
 to
 also


equiliiberate.
 So
 in
 my
 view
 it
 has
 not


been
 priced
 in.
 Maybe
 it's
 too
 early
 to


price
 in
 because
 maybe
 the
 Fed
 does
 not


lose
 its
 independence
 and
 you
 know
 rises


as
 phoenix
 from
 the
 ashes.
 But
 uh
 I'm
 a


little
 bit
 pessimistic
 about
 it.


>> Just
 going
 back
 to
 your
 storied
 career


on
 Wall
 Street
 for
 a
 second,
 how
 good


were
 you
 at
 playing
 Liars
 Poker?


>> I
 was
 actually
 pretty
 good.
 I
 uh
 think
 I


mean
 I
 learned
 it
 after
 I
 joined
 Solomon


Brothers
 was
 a
 good
 group
 of
 people
 and


I
 think
 the
 first
 year
 maybe
 I
 lost
 a


bit
 but
 I
 think
 in
 the
 third
 year
 that
 I


was
 there
 I
 won
 it
 and
 I
 was
 actually
 uh


I
 think
 the
 one
 who
 took
 the
 biggest


spot
 and
 I
 also
 my
 boss
 gave
 me
 his
 uh


18
 ft
 fishing
 boat
 but
 he
 was
 buying
 a


new
 one
 as
 part
 of
 the
 settlement
 that
 I


knew.


>> Yeah
 in
 lie
 of
 cash.
 He
 was
 like
 here


take
 my
 own.


>> Well
 cash
 plus
 the
 boat
 I
 think.
 So
 yeah


>> that's
 a
 really
 big
 pot.


>> That
 was
 a
 big
 pot.
 Yeah.
 At
 that
 point,


we
 used
 to
 spend
 after
 the
 trading
 day


was
 over.
 Every
 day
 we
 would
 print
 out


randomized
 liars
 poker
 sheets.
 Uh,


usually
 about
 24
 or
 30
 of
 them,
 and
 we'd


play
 about
 30
 30
 rounds
 every
 day.


>> Wait,
 Liars
 poker
 sheets.
 I
 thought
 you


played
 with
 actual
 cash.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 actual
 cash
 you
 play
 with


dollar
 bills,
 but
 uh,
 you
 know,
 if


you're
 playing
 24
 rounds,
 there
 are
 not


enough
 dollar
 bills
 flying
 around.


>> I
 never
 thought
 of
 that.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 you
 randomize
 based
 on
 how
 the


dollar
 bill
 numbers
 are
 generated.
 Yeah.


Is
 there
 going
 to
 be
 a
 future
 in
 finance


for
 a
 young
 physics
 student
 or
 a
 math


nerd
 in
 high
 school
 today?
 You
 know,


people
 worry
 about
 this
 with
 AI
 and
 so


forth,
 but
 a
 young
 person
 who's


quantitatively
 minded.
 Do
 you
 feel


confident
 that
 there
 will
 be
 a
 role
 for


them
 in
 finance
 in
 the
 future?


>> Absolutely.
 I
 think
 finance
 has
 existed


from
 the
 very
 very
 beginning
 because


it's
 based
 on
 the
 two
 fundamental


emotions,
 right?
 Greed
 and
 fear,
 right?


So
 as
 long
 as
 there's
 greed
 and
 fear
 and


there's
 smart
 people
 around
 uh
 and
 again


going
 back
 to
 math
 and
 physics
 it's
 not


so
 much
 that
 the
 toolkit
 itself
 is


teaching
 you
 anything
 special.
 It's
 just


it
 teaches
 you
 think
 in
 a
 discipline


logical
 fashion


>> and
 I
 think
 with
 tools
 like
 what
 we're


seeing
 with
 AI
 and
 so
 on
 and
 coding


becoming
 completely
 democratized.
 I


think
 the
 ability
 to
 ask
 important


questions
 rigorously
 becomes
 even
 more


important.
 So
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be


even
 better
 than
 it's
 been.


>> Veneer
 that
 was
 absolutely
 fantastic.


Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 spending
 time
 with


us
 at
 Huntington
 Beach
 at
 the
 Future


Proof
 Conference
 and
 that
 was
 great.


>> Yeah,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.
 That
 was


fantastic.
 Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


[Music]


>> Joe,
 that
 was
 really
 fun.
 We
 should
 have


an
 back
 and
 just
 do
 like
 stories
 from


Wall
 Street
 in
 the
 1990s
 episode.
 We


could
 do
 that.


>> I
 love
 the
 stories.
 We
 could
 do
 a
 lot


more
 on
 the
 stories
 and
 I'm
 also


interested
 in
 like
 basically
 you
 know


the
 philosophy
 of
 portfolio


construction.
 I
 mean
 obviously
 there's


the
 math
 of
 portfolio
 construction
 but
 I


do
 have
 a
 certain
 dissatisfaction
 with


many
 conversations
 about
 portfolio


construction
 including
 this


>> in
 what
 sense?


>> Well
 diversified
 stocks
 have
 almost


always
 gone
 up.
 Has
 every
 insurance
 I


mean
 I
 guess
 another
 question
 that
 I


could could
 have
 asked
 is
 has
 every


insurance
 contract
 on
 the
 stock
 market


essentially
 so
 far
 been
 a
 waste
 in
 human


history
 because
 the
 stock
 market
 is
 at


all-time
 highs.
 I
 have
 I
 have
 questions


about
 that.
 The
 counterpoint
 to
 that
 is,


and
 I've
 I've
 come
 to
 realize
 this
 as
 I


get
 older
 in
 my
 life
 and
 in
 my


portfolio,
 is
 there
 is
 something
 nice


about
 like
 waking
 up
 during
 a
 sell-off


and
 going
 like,
 "Oh,
 shoot.
 My
 401k
 has


been
 absolutely
 decimated
 today."
 But
 if


I
 look
 at,
 you
 know,
 some
 other
 position


or
 some
 other
 tail
 risk
 hedge
 that
 I


have,
 like
 that's
 actually
 up
 a
 little


bit
 and
 it's
 offset
 some
 of
 the
 pain.


And
 if
 I
 actually
 had
 to
 cash
 out
 of
 my


portfolio
 on
 that
 day
 because
 of


whatever
 I
 had
 to
 make
 a
 mortgage


payment
 or
 whatever,
 then
 I
 would
 have


some
 extra
 cash
 to
 spare.
 And
 you
 could


get
 an
 extra
 return
 by
 having
 that
 extra


cash
 available
 to
 you
 to
 then
 go
 into


the
 market
 and
 buy
 stuff
 on
 the
 cheap.


>> I
 think
 that
 we
 really
 should
 have
 an


odd
 lots
 ETF
 that
 is
 advertises
 its


illquidity
 that
 you
 can't
 sell
 this.
 If


you
 need
 cash
 now,
 this
 is
 not
 the


instrument
 for
 you.
 If
 you
 are
 putting


your
 money
 in
 this,
 don't
 expect
 to
 see


it
 again
 for
 30
 years.
 But
 the
 plus
 side


is
 it
 will
 keep
 you
 from
 making
 bad,


irrational
 decisions
 on
 a
 day
 when


everything
 is
 red.


>> I
 mean,
 there's
 there's
 a
 value
 in
 that.


There's
 a
 value
 in
 that.
 And
 there's


also
 a
 value
 in
 being
 able
 to,
 you
 know,


sleep
 at
 night
 a
 little
 easier
 because


you
 have
 different
 positions.
 But


anyway,
 should
 we
 leave
 it
 there?


>> Let's
 leave
 it
 there.


>> All right.
