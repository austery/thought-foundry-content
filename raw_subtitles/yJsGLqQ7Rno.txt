From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Natalie


Kitroof.
 This
 is
 the
 daily.


Seemingly
 overnight,
 America
 has
 seen
 an


explosion
 of
 new
 betting
 platforms
 that


have
 radically
 expanded
 the
 universe
 of


gambling.
 They're
 called
 prediction


markets.
 They
 let
 you
 bet
 on
 all
 kinds


of
 things
 like,
 will
 the
 US
 attack
 Iran?


What
 specific
 words
 will
 the
 president


say?
 And
 who
 will
 be
 at
 Taylor
 Swift's


wedding?


Today,
 my
 colleague
 David
 Yaffy
 Bellan


explains
 how
 these
 platforms
 became
 so


widespread
 so
 fast
 and
 how
 betting
 on


everything
 could
 change
 the
 way
 we
 live.


It's
 Wednesday,
 February
 4th.


>> David,
 it's
 wonderful
 to
 have
 you
 here


in
 studio.


>> Thanks
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me.


>> So,
 we
 are
 coming
 to
 you
 because
 you


cover
 crypto,
 which
 can
 often
 lead
 you


to
 the
 nichest
 corners
 of
 the
 internet.


I
 kind
 of
 think
 of
 you
 as
 having
 a


fringe
 capitalism
 beat.
 Is
 that
 fair?


>> That
 sounds
 about
 right.


>> Okay.
 and
 you've
 been
 looking
 into
 these


prediction
 markets,
 which
 I
 have
 a


million
 questions
 about.
 But
 before
 we


get
 into
 those
 questions,
 I
 want
 you
 to


first
 just
 lay
 out
 for
 people
 who
 don't


know
 these
 things,
 what
 are
 they?
 What


are
 these
 markets?
 At
 a
 really
 high


level,
 a
 prediction
 market
 is
 a
 platform


where
 you
 can
 bet
 on
 pretty
 much


everything.
 Most
 people
 are
 familiar


with
 sports
 betting,
 even
 the
 sort
 of


advanced
 sports
 betting
 that
 we
 get


these
 days
 where
 you're
 betting
 on
 like


whether
 a
 player
 will
 make
 a
 free
 throw.


Prediction
 markets
 expand
 that
 idea
 into


all
 corners
 of
 politics
 and
 culture.
 You


can
 bet
 on
 whether
 Trump
 will
 win
 the


election.
 You
 can
 bet
 on
 the
 date
 of


Taylor
 Swift's
 wedding.
 You
 can
 even
 bet


on
 whether
 the
 Supreme
 Leader
 of
 Iran


will
 make
 it
 to
 the
 end
 of
 the
 month.


So,
 what
 it's
 done
 is
 sort
 of
 expanded


that
 kind
 of
 gambling
 mentality
 to
 all


sorts
 of
 parts
 of
 our
 daily
 existence.


>> The
 idea
 is
 betting
 on
 everything


everywhere
 all
 at
 once.


>> Exactly.
 And
 now
 you've
 got
 people,


especially
 young
 people,
 logging
 onto


their
 phones
 the
 same
 way
 they
 might
 use


Tik
 Tok
 or
 Instagram
 and
 placing
 bets
 on


on
 elections,
 on
 pop
 culture,
 really
 on


everything.
 These
 platforms
 have
 the


potential
 to
 really
 change
 the
 way
 that


people
 interact
 with
 the
 world,
 the
 way


they
 think
 about
 the
 world.
 You
 know,


everything
 now
 has
 a
 price.


>> Everything
 can
 be
 communicated
 in
 terms


of
 the
 odds
 that
 it
 will
 happen
 or
 it


won't
 happen.
 And
 I
 think
 we're
 already


seeing
 signs
 that
 that's
 sort
 of


altering
 reality
 for
 people,


>> right?
 And
 it
 does
 feel
 that
 this
 stuff


has
 kind
 of
 come
 out
 of
 nowhere.
 Am
 I


right
 to
 think
 that
 these
 markets
 went


from
 being
 quite
 marginal
 to
 suddenly


being
 at
 the
 forefront
 of
 a
 lot
 of


cultural
 and
 political
 events?


>> To
 some
 extent,
 that's
 right.
 Go
 back


even
 2
 or
 3
 years
 ago
 and
 no
 one
 was


really
 talking
 about
 prediction
 markets.


But
 if
 you
 zoom
 out
 a
 little
 further,


what's
 happening
 now
 is
 really
 the


culmination
 of
 a
 trend
 that
 started
 back


in
 2018.


>> H


>> a
 US
 Supreme
 Court
 ruling
 today
 has


opened
 the
 door
 to
 a
 dramatic
 expansion


of
 legal
 sports
 betting.


>> That's
 when
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 overturned


a
 US
 law
 that
 had
 effectively
 banned


most
 sports
 betting
 in
 the
 US.
 Once
 that


law
 was
 ruled
 unconstitutional,
 we
 saw
 a


sort
 of
 avalanche
 of
 gambling.
 The


gaming
 industry
 is
 calling
 this
 a


groundbreaking
 decision
 that
 will


revolutionize
 the
 gambling
 business.


>> Right.
 This
 was
 a
 huge
 moment.


>> Yeah,
 it
 was
 enormous.


>> Also,
 DraftKings
 announcing
 that
 it
 will


enter
 the
 legal
 betting
 atmosphere


throughout
 states
 that
 choose
 to


legalize
 it.
 So,
 we're
 still


>> sports
 gambling
 companies
 across
 the


country
 went
 state
 by
 state
 getting


permission
 to
 offer
 their
 services
 and


suddenly
 people
 could
 gamble
 from
 their


phones.
 And
 this
 was
 a
 huge


transformation
 in
 the
 US.
 I
 mean
 in


other
 countries
 there's
 sort
 of
 always


been
 this
 type
 of
 gambling
 but
 it
 wasn't


really
 possible
 in
 the
 US.
 It
 was


something
 you
 had
 to
 do
 in
 a
 clandestine


way
 and
 suddenly
 it
 was
 all
 happening


out
 in
 the
 open
 and
 the
 marketing
 was


enormous.
 You
 couldn't
 avoid
 it.


>> Okay.
 So
 that
 SCOTS
 decision
 mostly


affected
 sports
 betting
 it
 sounds
 like.


What
 did
 it
 mean
 then
 for
 prediction


markets?
 On
 some
 level,
 it's
 not


directly
 related
 because
 legally
 this


decision
 didn't
 have
 anything
 to
 do
 with


prediction
 markets,
 but
 it
 created
 this


cultural
 moment
 where
 suddenly
 gambling


betting
 was
 totally
 accepted
 in
 the
 US.


It
 had
 sort
 of
 injected
 itself
 into
 the


American
 consciousness
 in
 a
 way
 that
 had


never
 happened
 before.
 And
 it
 was
 in


that
 context
 that
 a
 young
 entrepreneur


named
 Shane
 Copelan
 started
 a
 company


called
 Poly
 Market
 which
 has
 become
 one


of
 the
 leaders
 in
 this
 area.


>> Okay.
 So
 tell
 me
 the
 story
 of
 Copelan


founding
 this
 company.
 What's
 his
 idea


for
 it
 in
 the
 beginning?


>> Copelan's
 this
 young
 entrepreneur.
 He


spends
 one
 semester
 at
 NYU
 before


dropping
 out.
 And
 wow,


>> he
 has
 this
 super
 techy
 background.
 He


was
 really
 interested
 in


cryptocurrencies.
 He
 had
 kind
 of
 a
 nerdy


fascination
 with
 markets
 from
 a
 pretty


young
 age
 and
 the
 idea
 he
 had
 for
 poly


market
 was
 actually
 quite
 high-minded.


It
 came
 in
 2020
 just
 a
 few
 months
 into


the
 co
 pandemic.
 What
 really
 was
 the
 the


tipping
 point
 was
 during
 corona
 virus


there
 was
 so
 many
 different
 opinions
 and


so
 many
 forecasts
 that
 said
 entirely


different
 things.
 It
 was
 like


>> it
 was
 a
 time
 when
 a
 lot
 of
 information


was
 swirling
 around.
 There
 was


fluctuating
 case
 numbers,
 emerging


variance
 of
 the
 virus,
 and
 a
 lot
 of


people
 felt
 like
 it
 was
 hard
 to
 make


sense
 of
 the
 confusing
 swirl
 of


statistics.


>> And
 effectively,
 when
 you've
 got
 lots
 of


conflicting
 viewpoints
 and
 information


and
 opinions,
 a
 market
 is
 a
 way
 to


distill
 that
 information
 into
 one


accurate
 fact
 or
 indicator
 or
 signal.


>> So,
 in
 Copelan's
 mind,
 prediction


markets
 could
 help
 clarify
 this


confusion.
 It's
 not
 just
 a
 way
 for


people
 to
 gamble
 on
 everything.
 To
 him,


Poly
 Market
 is
 about
 creating
 a
 new


source
 of
 information
 in
 the
 world.


>> We
 are
 missionaries
 for
 the
 concepts
 of


market-based
 journalism
 and
 helping


people
 make
 better
 decisions
 by


leveraging
 markets.


>> And
 it's
 all
 based
 on
 an
 idea
 that
 has


long
 been
 studied
 in
 academia,
 discussed


in
 financial
 circles
 that
 crowdsourcing


information
 could
 produce
 more
 accurate


projections
 about
 the
 future
 than
 what


any
 individual
 expert
 might
 come
 up


with.
 So
 the
 idea
 here
 is
 that
 the


source
 of
 truth
 and
 knowledge
 that


prediction
 markets
 are
 offering
 could


actually
 become
 a
 compliment
 or
 even
 a


replacement
 for
 things
 like
 traditional


media.


>> You
 have
 this
 public
 good
 that's
 like
 a


mecca
 of
 real
 time
 unbiased
 information


where
 you
 go
 on
 poly
 market
 and
 you
 can


just
 see
 oh
 this
 is
 what
 you
 know
 the


odds
 of
 this
 happening
 are
 in
 the


future.
 And
 interesting.
 It
 sounds
 like


he's
 thinking
 that
 these
 could
 be
 more


accurate
 sources
 of
 information
 than


traditional
 media
 in
 part
 because
 it's


crowd
 sourcing.


>> It's
 crowdsourcing
 and
 it's
 also
 a


financial
 market.
 So
 people
 have
 skin
 in


the
 game.


>> People
 can
 debate
 each
 other
 and
 be


like,
 "Oh,
 you're
 wrong.
 This,
 this,


that."
 But
 the
 way
 that
 those
 that


really
 dissipates
 is
 when
 you
 let
 people


put
 their
 money
 where
 their
 mouth
 is.


And
 the
 idea
 is
 that
 when
 people
 have


money
 on
 the
 line,
 they
 tell
 the
 truth


or
 they're
 incentivized
 to
 research


their
 opinions
 as
 thoroughly
 as


possible.
 And
 if
 you
 can
 pull
 all
 of


that
 together,
 then
 you've
 got
 a
 kind
 of


amazing
 new
 source
 of
 information.
 So


Copelan
 is
 not
 just
 thinking
 of
 turning


the
 whole
 world
 into
 some
 kind
 of


virtual
 casino
 here.
 He's
 imagining
 this


as
 a
 tool
 for
 revealing
 things
 about
 the


world,
 for
 gathering
 and
 disseminating


information.


>> Absolutely.


>> Okay.
 At
 this
 point,
 I
 feel
 like
 we
 need


to
 understand
 exactly
 how
 this
 market


works,
 how
 the
 betting
 works.
 Can
 you


walk
 me
 through
 that?


>> Yeah,
 this
 is
 a
 good
 question
 and
 a
 lot


of
 people
 don't
 fully
 understand
 it.


Prediction
 markets
 are
 essentially
 a


series
 of
 yes
 or
 no
 questions.
 So
 if
 you


log
 on
 to
 the
 poly
 market
 website,
 you


will
 see
 questions
 like,
 will
 the


Iranian
 regime
 fall
 before
 2027?


And
 if
 you
 want
 to
 bet
 on
 that,
 you
 buy


what's
 known
 as
 an
 event
 contract.


>> An
 event
 contract.


>> Yeah.
 And
 that's
 the
 yes
 option
 or
 the


no
 option
 on
 any
 of
 these
 questions.


>> Okay.
 And
 the
 cost
 of
 those
 contracts
 of


a
 yes
 or
 of
 a
 no
 always
 fluctuates


between
 $0
 and
 $1.
 And
 that
 price
 is


essentially
 a
 reflection
 of
 what
 the


market
 of
 betterers
 out
 there
 think
 is


going
 to
 happen.


>> So
 if
 the
 yes
 option
 on
 the
 Iranian


regime
 falling
 is
 going
 for
 20
 cents,


then
 that
 means
 there's
 about
 a
 20%


likelihood
 of
 the
 regime
 falling.
 It's


relatively
 cheap
 to
 buy
 that
 contract


because
 the
 universe
 of
 betters
 thinks


it's
 relatively
 unlikely
 that
 this
 will


happen.


>> Exactly.
 And
 then
 the
 payout
 arrives


when
 the
 event
 either
 definitively


happens
 or
 doesn't
 happen.
 So
 if
 the


regime
 does
 fall
 and
 you
 bought
 that
 yes


contract
 at
 20
 and
 you
 correctly


predicted
 what
 would
 happen,
 then
 the


contract
 rises
 in
 value
 to
 $1
 and
 you


get
 your
 payout.
 And
 because
 this


resembles
 a
 kind
 of
 financial
 market,
 it


falls
 under
 a
 different
 type
 of


regulation
 than
 traditional
 sports


books.
 Sports
 books
 are
 regulated
 by
 the


states,
 their
 state
 laws
 governing


gambling.
 And
 the
 prediction
 markets


instead
 are
 regulated
 at
 the
 federal


level
 by
 a
 financial
 agency
 called
 the


Commodity
 Futures
 Trading
 Commission,


the
 CFTC.
 And
 the
 idea
 here
 is
 that
 the


CFTC
 should
 be
 protecting
 against
 abuses


in
 the
 realm
 of
 prediction
 markets.


Insider
 trading
 is
 an
 easy
 example
 of


that
 or
 market
 manipulation,
 things
 that


could
 threaten
 the
 integrity
 of
 a


financial
 market.


>> But
 Copeland
 didn't
 go
 down
 that
 path.


Initially,
 he
 didn't
 register
 poly


market
 with
 the
 CFTC.


>> And
 that's
 sort
 of
 in
 line
 with
 the
 kind


of
 move
 fast
 and
 break
 things
 ethos
 of


the
 tech
 industry,


>> right?
 the
 ask
 for
 forgiveness
 not


permission
 style
 of
 operating.


>> Exactly.
 And
 Copelan
 was
 taking
 a


similar
 approach.
 But
 ultimately
 that


got
 him
 into
 a
 lot
 of
 trouble.


>> In
 2022,
 the
 CFTC
 fined
 Poly
 Market
 $1.4


million.
 And
 as
 part
 of
 that
 legal


settlement,
 Copelan
 had
 to
 agree
 that


Poly
 Market
 wouldn't
 operate
 in
 the


United
 States.
 It's
 only
 open
 to
 foreign


users.
 And
 why
 does
 Copeland
 agree
 to


that?
 I
 mean,
 that
 sounds
 like
 a


potential
 death
 nail
 for
 a
 company
 like


this.


>> Well,
 the
 legal
 landscape
 in
 the
 US
 was


complicated.
 And
 so,
 on
 some
 level,
 it


might
 have
 seemed
 actually
 less
 risky
 to


sort
 of
 try
 its
 luck
 outside
 of
 the
 US.


>> But
 the
 other
 element
 to
 this
 is
 that


there
 was
 a
 workaround.
 If
 someone


really
 wanted
 to
 use
 Poly
 Market
 from


inside
 the
 United
 States,
 they
 could


download
 a
 a
 VPN,
 a
 virtual
 private


network
 and
 essentially
 trick
 the


website
 into
 thinking
 that
 they
 were


logging
 on
 from
 another
 country,


>> right?


>> And
 this
 was
 extremely
 easy
 to
 do.
 I've


spoken
 to
 many
 people
 who
 did
 it.
 I've


spoken
 to
 at
 least
 one
 former
 Poly


Market
 employee
 who
 told
 me
 that
 it
 was


sort
 of
 an
 open
 secret
 in
 the
 office


that
 people
 were
 doing
 this.
 And
 it


meant
 that
 this
 US
 ban
 was
 largely


theoretical.


>> And
 at
 this
 point,
 do
 we
 know
 who's


actually
 using
 this
 thing?


>> At
 this
 point,
 it's
 still
 primarily
 a


base
 of
 techsavvy
 people
 who
 are
 really


interested
 in
 these
 things
 in
 kind
 of
 a


nerdy
 way.


>> Got
 it.


>> To
 use
 Poly
 Market,
 you
 had
 to
 use


cryptocurrencies.
 So,
 you're
 already


limiting
 yourself
 to
 a
 pool
 of
 people


who
 are
 comfortable
 transacting
 in


crypto.


>> In
 your
 world.


>> In
 my
 world.
 Yeah.
 And
 if
 you
 wanted
 to


use
 it
 in
 the
 US,
 you
 had
 to
 know
 how
 to


use
 a
 VPN.
 So
 it's
 not
 as
 if
 this
 was,


you
 know,
 freely
 available
 to
 anyone
 who


might
 potentially
 be
 interested.


>> And
 are
 people
 using
 it
 in
 the
 way
 that


Copelan
 imagined
 they
 would
 to
 kind
 of


create
 new
 sources
 of
 information
 to


illuminate
 things
 that
 maybe
 weren't


clear
 before
 there
 was
 the
 potential
 to


bet
 on
 them?


>> They
 are
 starting
 to
 do
 that.
 It's


gaining
 popularity.
 It's
 growing.
 It's


getting
 more
 attention
 in
 the
 media.
 And


it
 really
 comes
 to
 a
 head
 in
 2024
 as
 the


presidential
 election
 is
 heating
 up.
 And


it
 starts
 that
 summer
 after
 Joe
 Biden's


disastrous
 debate
 performance
 when


there's
 all
 kinds
 of
 speculation
 about


whether
 Biden
 will
 drop
 out
 of
 the
 race.


And
 suddenly
 users
 of
 Poly
 Market
 start


betting
 on
 that.
 H
 at
 the
 time
 many


Democratic
 talking
 heads,
 pundits,
 the


Biden
 administration,
 and
 of
 course


Biden
 himself
 were
 saying
 he's
 not
 going


to
 drop
 out,
 but
 the
 betting
 market


projected
 that
 he
 would
 drop
 out.
 So


when
 Biden
 eventually
 did,
 it
 felt
 like


a
 moment
 of
 vindication
 for
 poly
 market


and
 sort
 of
 a
 preview
 of
 what
 it
 might


offer
 to
 the
 world,
 right?
 Because
 I
 can


imagine
 Copeland
 sees
 this
 as
 proof
 of


concept.
 here
 you
 can
 come
 and
 get
 what


I
 presume
 Copeland
 views
 as
 an
 objective


sense
 of
 the
 odds


>> right
 and
 of
 course
 it's
 not
 like
 this


was
 some
 question
 nobody
 was
 considering


or
 that
 there
 wasn't
 punditry
 about
 it


or
 people
 predicting
 that
 it
 would


happen
 but


>> poly
 market
 was
 a
 place
 where
 all
 of


that
 was
 sort
 of
 consolidated
 into
 one


number
 and
 you
 could
 kind
 of
 get
 a
 sense


of
 the
 way
 the
 wind
 was
 blowing


>> and
 that
 moment
 that
 question
 of
 whether


Biden
 will
 drop
 out
 then
 sets
 poly


market
 up
 for
 the
 next
 big
 question
 of


the
 2024
 race,
 which
 of
 course
 is
 who's


going
 to
 win
 the
 election?
 Will
 it
 be


Harris
 or
 will
 it
 be
 Trump?
 And
 it
 feels


like
 a
 really
 long
 time
 ago
 now,
 but
 a


tied
 race,
 dead
 heat
 among
 likely


voters.
 47%
 Harris,
 47%
 Trump.
 It


obviously
 doesn't
 get
 closer
 to
 that.


And
 I
 want
 to
 show


>> back
 then
 it
 was
 a
 close
 race.
 The
 polls


showed
 that
 the
 two
 candidates
 were


essentially
 neck
 andneck.
 But
 the


projections
 on
 poly
 market
 started
 to


shift
 heavily
 in
 Trump's
 favor
 and


obviously
 Trump
 did
 win.


>> Big
 night
 for
 prediction
 markets
 and


calling
 President
 Trump
 elect
 as
 the


winner
 at
 the
 polls.


>> And
 it
 was
 another
 moment
 of
 vindication


for
 Copeland's
 site.


>> Another
 example
 for
 him
 at
 least
 of
 it


being
 a
 more
 reliable
 predictor
 than


traditional
 media
 sources,
 traditional


polls.


>> Exactly.
 As
 the
 saying
 of
 free
 markets


goes,
 a
 diverse
 group
 of
 market


participants
 like
 you
 see
 on
 poly
 market


is
 more
 accurate
 than
 any
 given
 expert.


And
 what
 was
 especially
 fascinating


about
 this
 example
 is
 that
 we
 got
 kind


of
 a
 peak
 under
 the
 hood
 at
 how
 these


projections
 came
 about.
 Now
 remember


that
 these
 projections
 are
 the
 result
 of


a
 financial
 market
 and
 a
 few
 large


trades
 can
 shift
 a
 financial
 market


significantly.
 And
 in
 this
 case,
 a


wealthy
 trader
 in
 France
 came
 forward


and
 said
 that
 he
 had
 made
 $30
 million
 in


bets
 that
 Trump
 would
 win
 the
 election.


And
 that
 this
 was
 based
 on
 his
 own


careful
 research.
 He'd
 actually


commissioned
 his
 own
 poll.


>> Wow.


>> Because
 he
 thought
 the
 traditional
 US


polling
 was
 misleading.
 And
 that
 just


out
 of
 that
 conviction,
 he
 put
 all
 of


this
 money
 on
 Trump,
 which
 effectively


shifted
 the
 polyarket
 odds
 in
 Trump's


favor.
 And
 it
 was
 a
 profitable
 play.
 Uh


this
 guy
 made
 more
 than
 $85
 million
 in


profits
 when
 Trump
 won
 the
 election.


>> People
 started
 calling
 him
 the
 French


whale.


>> Okay.
 So
 obviously
 a
 huge
 payout
 for


this
 one
 guy.
 What
 do
 you
 make
 of
 this


moment
 for
 the
 markets
 themselves?


>> It
 had
 a
 huge
 impact.
 Suddenly
 these


markets
 that
 had
 sort
 of
 operated
 on
 the


margins
 of
 the
 financial
 system
 getting


some
 notice
 but
 not
 a
 ton.
 Suddenly


everyone
 stands
 up
 and
 says,
 "Wow,
 huge


amounts
 of
 money
 are
 changing
 hands
 on


these
 things.
 We
 really
 have
 to
 take


them
 seriously."


>> And
 of
 course,
 Copelan
 is
 taking
 a


victory
 lap.


But
 soon
 we
 learned
 that
 this
 entire


time
 as
 the
 company
 has
 been
 blowing
 up,


becoming
 a
 big
 mainstream
 phenomenon.


They've
 been
 under
 a
 federal
 criminal


investigation.
 Wo.
 In
 fact,
 shortly


after
 the
 election,
 the
 FBI
 raids


Copeland's
 home
 in
 New
 York
 City.
 they


take
 his
 phone
 and
 it's
 all
 part
 of
 an


investigation
 into
 whether
 Poly
 Market


is
 illegally
 allowing
 US
 users
 to
 access


the
 platform.


>> So
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 you've
 got
 this


moment
 of
 public
 vindication.
 You
 also


have
 this
 really
 fraught
 legal
 moment


where
 it's
 not
 clear
 whether
 the


platform
 can
 survive
 in
 the
 United


States.
 But
 there's
 a
 light
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 tunnel
 for
 Copelan,
 which
 is
 that


soon
 Trump
 is
 going
 to
 take
 office.
 And


as
 soon
 as
 he's
 in
 power,
 everything


changes.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Okay.
 So,
 tell
 me
 what
 exactly
 changes


for
 these
 markets
 when
 Trump
 comes
 to


office.


>> Since
 Trump's
 taken
 over,
 there's
 been
 a


complete
 change
 in
 attitude
 toward
 these


platforms.
 Copelan,
 whose
 house
 had
 only


just
 been
 raided
 by
 the
 FBI,
 was
 invited


to
 a
 summit
 for
 tech
 executives
 at
 the


White
 House.
 Donald
 Trump
 Jr.
 became
 a


formal
 adviser
 to
 Poly
 Market.
 And
 most


importantly,
 the
 Justice
 Department


under
 Trump
 officially
 dropped
 this


investigation
 into
 Copelan.
 And
 this
 is


all
 happening
 in
 the
 context
 of
 a
 legal


battle
 involving
 one
 of
 Poly
 Market's


competitors,
 a
 company
 called
 Kelshi


that
 also
 offers
 its
 own
 prediction


market,
 which
 around
 the
 time
 of
 the


election
 had
 won
 a
 big
 legal
 dispute


with
 the
 CFTC.


>> So
 suddenly
 all
 these
 legal
 troubles


that
 had
 been
 hovering
 over
 the
 company


and
 the
 markets
 in
 general,
 they
 kind
 of


seem
 to
 disappear.


>> Yeah.
 They
 vanish.
 So
 you've
 got
 this


culmination
 of
 a
 bunch
 of
 things.
 a
 kind


of
 pro
 business
 attitude
 brought
 by
 the


Trump
 administration,
 this
 legal
 victory


secured
 by
 Kelshi.
 And
 so,
 while
 it


didn't
 happen
 overnight,
 what
 that
 meant


is
 that
 US-based
 users
 were
 now
 allowed


to
 use
 these
 platforms
 without
 a
 VPN.


They
 become
 easily
 available
 to
 almost


anyone.


I
 just
 found
 out
 about
 Poly
 Market.
 I


started
 with
 um
 $10
 and
 I'm
 up
 like
 $100


something
 dollars.


>> And
 that
 feeds
 into
 this
 larger
 cultural


shift.


>> I'm
 a
 full-time
 Poly
 Market
 trader
 and
 a


lot
 of
 people
 don't
 understand
 how
 you


can
 make
 a
 full-time
 living
 on
 Poly


Market.
 But
 let
 me
 explain.


>> People
 are
 using
 these
 platforms
 more


and
 more.
 They're
 more
 available
 in
 the


United
 States.
 The
 NHL
 just
 became
 the


first
 major
 US
 pro
 league
 to
 strike


licensing
 deals
 with
 prediction
 market


platforms
 Khi
 and
 Poly
 Market.


>> Poly
 Market
 is
 going
 to
 become
 the


official
 prediction
 market
 partner
 for


the
 UFC.


>> Kelsey
 just
 announced
 a
 new
 partnership


this
 week
 with
 Coinbase.


>> With
 every
 passing
 week
 comes
 some
 new


major
 partnership
 that
 brings
 them
 more


and
 more
 into
 the
 mainstream.


>> Dow
 Jones
 is
 teaming
 up
 with
 Poly


Market.
 This
 is
 an
 exclusive
 partnership


and
 it'll
 make
 Poly
 Markets
 realtime


prediction
 data
 available
 across
 Dow


Jones
 platforms
 including
 the
 Wall


Street
 Journal.


>> Big
 media
 organizations
 like
 CNN,
 CNBC,


the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 have
 formal


partnerships
 with
 Kelshi
 and
 Poly
 Market


to
 use
 data
 from
 the
 sites
 in
 their
 news


reports.


>> Wow.


>> Good
 evening
 and
 welcome
 to
 the
 83rd


Golden
 Globes.
 The
 Golden
 Globes


featured
 Poly
 Market
 odds
 on
 the
 live


broadcast.


>> Here
 are
 the
 nominees
 for
 best
 podcast.


Roll
 the
 tape.


>> Right
 before
 the
 best
 podcast
 award
 was


announced,
 Poly
 Market
 odds
 were


projected
 on
 the
 screen.


>> And
 so,
 it's
 been
 this
 huge
 kind
 of


cultural
 awakening
 toward
 these
 things.


It
 is
 kind
 of
 wild,
 David,
 to
 just


consider
 the
 trajectory
 that
 you've
 laid


out
 for
 us
 here.
 a
 year
 ago
 about
 these


markets
 were
 operating
 as
 a
 kind
 of


niche
 illegal
 backwater
 on
 the
 internet


where
 you
 had
 to
 pay
 in
 crypto
 and
 have


a
 VPN
 to
 use
 them
 and
 now
 they're
 like


fully
 in
 the
 mainstream.
 Yeah,
 the
 scale


is
 enormous.
 There
 was
 about
 $12
 billion


in
 trading
 volume
 on
 Poly
 Market
 and


Kelshi
 in
 December.
 That's
 a
 400%


increase
 from
 the
 year
 before.


>> Wow.
 And
 look,
 granted,
 that's
 still
 a


smaller
 user
 base
 than
 bets
 on


traditional
 sports
 books,
 but
 the
 level


of
 growth
 is
 pretty
 impressive.
 So,
 one


recent
 example
 that
 got
 a
 lot
 of


attention
 is
 a
 betting
 market
 on
 poly


market
 about
 whether
 the
 president
 of


Venezuela,
 Nicholas
 Maduro,
 would
 be


removed
 from
 power.


>> Right.
 I
 saw
 that.
 And
 some
 of
 the


betting
 on
 that
 Maduro
 question
 actually


raised
 new
 concerns
 about
 how
 these


platforms
 operate.
 Shortly
 before
 the
 US


operation
 in
 Venezuela
 to
 remove
 Maduro,


an
 anonymous
 better
 on
 Poly
 Market


placed
 a
 large
 bet
 that
 Maduro
 would
 be


removed
 from
 power.
 And
 then
 of
 course


he
 was
 and
 that
 trader
 made
 a
 big


profit.
 But
 the
 timing
 of
 that
 bet
 was


so
 good
 that
 it
 convinced
 a
 lot
 of


people
 that
 this
 trader
 must
 have
 had


some
 sort
 of
 advanced
 knowledge
 about


the
 operation.
 That
 this
 must
 have
 been


some
 kind
 of
 insider
 trading
 based
 on
 a


government
 leak
 or
 somebody
 in


government
 improperly
 using
 the
 site.


Right?
 I
 remember
 when
 that
 happened


because
 I
 was
 following
 the
 Maduro
 news


very
 closely.
 people
 saw
 that
 bet
 and


just
 did
 assume
 that
 this
 person
 who


made
 it
 was
 potentially
 close
 to
 the


White
 House
 and
 knew
 in
 advance
 it
 was


going
 to
 happen.
 Yeah.
 To
 be
 clear,


there
 was
 no
 evidence
 of
 that.
 It
 was


never
 proven.
 But
 I
 think
 what
 we're


seeing
 here
 is
 something
 that
 we've


already
 seen
 in
 the
 realm
 of
 sports,


which
 is
 when
 betting
 becomes
 super


mainstream,
 there's
 an
 aura
 of
 suspicion


that
 develops
 around
 everything.
 People


become
 convinced
 that
 things
 are
 rigged,


that
 somebody's
 cheating
 to
 try
 to
 make


money.
 And
 now
 we're
 seeing
 that
 aura


extend
 to
 all
 sorts
 of
 other
 things
 in


the
 real
 world
 outside
 of
 sports.


>> And
 that's
 even
 bled
 into
 how
 the
 news


makers
 themselves
 are
 operating.
 There


was
 an
 incident
 last
 fall
 where
 Brian


Armstrong,
 the
 chief
 executive
 of


Coinbase,
 which
 is
 the
 largest
 crypto


company
 in
 the
 US,
 was
 doing
 an
 earnings


call.
 And
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 there
 was
 a


betting
 market
 on
 both
 Kel
 and
 Poly


Market,
 on
 what
 words
 he
 would
 utter


during
 that
 earnings
 call.
 Could
 I
 just


pause
 and
 say
 how
 amazing
 it
 is
 that


there
 were
 bets
 being
 made
 on
 what
 words


he
 would
 use
 in
 an
 earnings
 call?


>> Maybe
 someday
 there'll
 be
 bets
 on
 what


you'll
 say
 on
 the
 daily.
 I
 mean,
 who


knows?
 It's
 all
 sort
 of
 fair
 game
 at


this
 point.


>> Anyway,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 this
 earnings


call,


>> yeah,
 I
 hope
 we
 answer
 your
 question
 on


that.
 Um,
 I
 was
 a
 little
 distracted


because
 I
 was
 tracking
 the
 prediction


market
 about
 what
 Coinbase
 will
 say
 on


their
 next
 earnings
 call.
 And
 I
 just


want
 to


>> Armstrong
 says,
 "Oh,
 I've
 actually
 been


looking
 at
 the
 prediction
 markets."
 And


>> I
 just
 want
 to
 add
 here
 the
 words


Bitcoin,
 Ethereum,
 blockchain,
 staking,


and
 web
 3
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 get
 those
 in


before
 the
 end
 of
 the
 call.


>> Then
 he
 just
 reels
 off
 a
 list
 of
 the


words
 that
 people
 were
 betting
 on.
 Wow.


>> You
 know,
 influencing
 the
 market


directly.
 Now,
 Armstrong
 has
 said
 that


he
 personally
 wasn't
 betting
 on
 this


market.
 He
 didn't
 have
 a
 stake
 in
 what


he
 was
 going
 to
 say,
 but
 it's
 an


illustration
 of
 how
 easily
 these
 markets


could
 be
 manipulated.


>> Right?
 This
 CEO
 says
 this
 didn't
 benefit


him,
 but
 it's
 pretty
 easy
 to
 imagine
 a


situation
 in
 which
 someone
 does
 actually


have
 a
 stake
 in
 an
 outcome
 that
 they
 can


influence
 and
 colludes
 with
 people
 to


make
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 manipulating
 it.


>> Yeah,
 it
 could
 happen.


>> And
 we've
 obviously
 seen
 that
 in
 sports


betting.
 players
 colluding
 with
 betters


to
 change
 the
 outcome
 of
 games
 or
 of


things
 that
 happen
 within
 the
 games.
 In


sports
 betting
 cases,
 those
 lead
 often


to
 criminal
 charges,
 but
 in
 this
 case,


is
 this
 kind
 of
 cheating
 actually


punished?
 So,
 the
 CFDC
 does
 have
 a
 rule


against
 insider
 trading,
 but
 this
 is


such
 a
 new
 area
 that
 it
 hasn't
 really


been
 tested.
 So,
 it
 remains
 kind
 of
 a


big
 question
 mark.
 Koshi,
 which
 is
 Poly


Market's
 biggest
 competitor,
 has
 taken


the
 position
 that
 insider
 trading
 is
 bad


and
 that
 there
 are
 protections
 in
 place


on
 the
 platform
 to
 prevent
 it
 and
 to


report
 it.
 But
 there
 are
 other
 people
 in


the
 kind
 of
 prediction
 market
 sphere
 who


actually
 think
 insider
 trading
 is
 a
 good


thing.
 And
 that
 goes
 back
 to
 that
 kind


of
 high-minded
 goal
 behind
 some
 of
 these


products
 that
 they
 could
 become
 a
 source


of
 truth
 in
 the
 world.


>> Wait,
 tell
 me
 how
 cheating
 is
 part
 of


the
 high-mindedness.


>> Sure.
 If
 what
 you
 want
 to
 do
 is
 produce


the
 best
 possible
 projection
 about
 what


will
 happen
 to
 Nicholas
 Maduro,
 then
 if


someone
 who
 has
 insider
 information


about
 that
 is
 placing
 bets
 and
 moving


the
 market,
 you
 end
 up
 with
 a
 much


better
 projection.


>> But
 isn't
 there
 a
 case,
 David,
 for
 these


companies
 that
 operate
 these
 markets
 to


be
 worried
 about
 the
 business


implications
 of
 cheating?
 Like
 wouldn't


a
 Shane
 Copelan
 for
 example
 be
 concerned


that
 people
 wouldn't
 want
 to
 participate


in
 poly
 market
 if
 they
 know
 that
 they


may
 be
 taking
 a
 sucker's
 bet
 on
 some
 of


these
 big
 events
 where
 the
 person
 on
 the


other
 side
 actually
 has
 good
 information


and
 they're
 just
 making
 a
 guess.
 Yeah,


absolutely.
 And
 these
 companies
 have


taken
 a
 big
 reputational
 hit
 from
 some


of
 these
 incidents
 over
 the
 past
 few


months.
 But
 look,
 I've
 covered
 these


sorts
 of
 strange
 financial
 instruments


for
 a
 long
 time,
 and
 it's
 pretty
 amazing


what
 people
 will
 throw
 their
 money
 into.


You
 know,
 I've
 seen
 people
 buy
 useless


meme
 coins
 that
 are
 clearly
 part
 of
 a


pump
 and
 dump
 scheme,
 but
 they
 do
 it


anyway.
 People
 aren't
 always
 rational


with
 their
 money.
 You
 know,
 you're


always
 convinced
 that
 you're
 the
 one


person
 who
 has
 the
 inside
 scoop
 and
 can


figure
 out
 how
 to
 make
 money
 from


something
 that
 everybody
 else
 is
 losing


money
 on,


>> right?
 You're
 not
 the
 sucker.


>> Exactly.


>> David,
 you
 made
 it
 clear
 that
 these


platforms
 have
 persuaded
 regulators
 that


what
 they're
 doing
 is
 not
 facilitating


gambling.
 They
 obviously
 call
 themselves


prediction
 markets,
 not
 betting
 apps.


But
 the
 reality
 is
 the
 way
 they
 work
 as


you've
 described
 it
 is
 much
 more
 like


gambling
 than
 the
 stock
 market.
 Right?


These
 are
 quick
 fix
 kind
 of
 bets.
 Look,


as
 I've
 started
 reporting
 on
 these


platforms,
 I've
 also
 started
 using
 them


with
 a
 small
 amount
 of
 the
 New
 York


Times's
 money.


>> Oh,
 wow.
 How
 much?


>> Uh,
 $20.


>> Oh,
 wow.
 Generous.


>> And
 any
 profits
 would
 would
 go
 to
 to


charity,
 so
 it
 was
 a
 real
 philanthropic


opportunity
 for
 me.


>> How'd
 you
 do?


>> Um,
 I've
 already
 blown
 it.
 I'm
 down
 to


$10.


>> Okay.
 You're
 no
 French
 whale.


>> Exactly.
 But
 one
 thing
 I
 I
 I
 learned


from
 playing
 around
 with
 these
 platforms


a
 little
 bit
 is
 that
 it
 does
 feel
 like


gambling.
 You
 know,
 these
 platforms
 are


designed
 to
 kind
 of
 suck
 you
 in.
 You


know,
 they've
 got
 bright
 colors
 and
 you


know,
 you
 see
 numbers
 going
 up
 and
 down


and
 and
 it's
 exciting.
 And
 when
 you're


just
 playing
 around
 with
 a
 few
 dollars


of
 your
 company's
 money,
 that's
 totally


fine.
 But
 when
 you're
 potentially


vulnerable
 to
 addiction
 and
 you're


spending
 money
 that
 you
 need
 for
 other


things
 on
 these
 platforms,
 there's
 a


real
 risk.
 And
 one
 thing
 we
 know
 about


this
 type
 of
 bedding
 is
 that
 it's


especially
 popular
 among
 young
 people,


especially
 young
 men.
 It's
 kind
 of
 their


vice
 of
 choice
 these
 days.
 And
 so


whatever
 the
 long-term
 consequences
 of


this
 are,
 it's
 probably
 going
 to
 be
 felt


by
 that
 demographic,
 young
 people,


>> right?
 If
 you
 have
 a
 gambling
 addiction,


like
 you
 said,
 there's
 all
 these
 reasons


why
 you're
 compelled
 to
 keep
 betting.


And
 if
 you're
 just
 someone
 who
 finds


them
 fun,
 you're
 looking
 for


entertainment.
 You're
 looking
 for
 this


kind
 of
 world
 that's
 been
 created
 by


these
 markets,
 which
 as
 you've
 described


it
 to
 me,
 kind
 of
 turns
 reality
 into


something
 like
 a
 video
 game.


>> Yeah.
 And
 the
 consequences
 of
 that
 are


starting
 to
 become
 clear.
 It
 it's


changing
 the
 stakes
 of
 reality
 for


people,
 changing
 the
 way
 they
 relate
 to


things
 that
 are
 happening
 in
 the
 world,


even
 things
 that
 are
 really
 important


and
 have
 human
 consequences.
 I
 mean,
 we


have
 seen
 prediction
 markets
 betting
 on


the
 LA
 wildfires
 on
 how
 quickly
 they


would
 be
 contained.


>> There
 was
 betting
 on
 the
 war
 in
 Gaza,


whether
 that
 situation
 would
 be


classified
 as
 a
 famine.


>> And
 all
 those
 things
 are,
 you
 know,


devastating
 for
 the
 real
 people
 in
 those


situations.
 But
 now
 you
 have
 a
 class
 of


internet
 speculator
 who's
 engaging
 with


them
 as
 potentially
 profitmaking


opportunities.
 Yeah.
 I
 have
 to
 say
 it's


pretty
 dark
 to
 imagine
 people
 putting


money
 behind
 the
 notion,
 for
 example,


that
 Gaza
 would
 be
 declared
 a
 famine
 or


that
 the
 fires
 in
 LA
 wouldn't
 be
 put
 out


and
 then
 potentially
 having
 a
 rooting


interest
 in
 that
 outcome.
 Like
 just
 to


put
 a
 fine
 point
 on
 it,
 it
 means


presumably
 you
 have
 people
 hoping
 that


these
 terrible
 things
 will
 happen


because
 they'll
 make
 money
 on
 it.


>> A
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 that
 reaction
 and


it's
 totally
 a
 real
 concern.
 I'll
 just


turn
 it
 around
 and
 try
 to
 kind
 of


capture
 what
 the
 companies
 would
 say
 to


this.
 Specifically
 on
 that
 example
 of


the
 LA
 wildfire,


>> people
 have
 a
 real
 interest
 in
 knowing


when
 the
 fires
 would
 be
 contained.


they're
 making
 decisions
 that
 affect


their
 lives
 based
 on
 that.
 And
 so
 if
 you


have
 a
 crowdsourced


verdict
 on
 that
 question,
 that
 could


potentially
 be
 really
 helpful.
 So
 on


some
 of
 these
 markets,
 you
 can
 still


make,
 you
 know,
 a
 version
 of
 that


high-minded
 argument
 that
 Copelan
 came


into
 this
 industry
 with,
 but
 on
 some
 of


the
 others,
 it's
 definitely
 a
 lot


tougher
 to
 justify.
 And
 I
 guess
 then


even
 if
 you
 buy
 the
 premise
 that
 there's


utility
 in
 these
 bets,
 I
 think
 it's


worth
 asking
 what
 the
 cost
 of
 that
 is.


Like
 what
 it
 does
 to
 us
 as
 a
 society
 to


suddenly
 be
 relating
 to
 the
 real
 world


and
 sometimes
 to
 real
 world
 suffering
 in


this
 kind
 of
 gamified
 way.


>> Yeah.
 And
 it
 has
 a
 sort
 of
 distancing


effect.
 Suddenly
 these
 things
 become


kind
 of
 abstract
 the
 same
 way
 the
 price


of
 a
 stock
 is
 sort
 of
 abstract
 to
 people


and
 what
 the
 long-term
 consequences
 of


that
 will
 be
 it's
 hard
 to
 say
 but
 it's


clear
 that
 this
 is
 a
 future
 that
 these


companies
 want.
 One
 of
 the
 co-founders


of
 Khi
 says
 that
 he
 wants
 to


financialize
 everything
 to
 turn
 every


difference
 in
 opinion
 into
 a
 tradable


asset.
 It's
 the
 idea
 that
 any
 event
 in


the
 real
 world
 could
 be
 communicated
 in


financial
 terms
 as
 odds
 of
 this


happening,
 odds
 of
 that
 happening,
 even


if
 it's
 something
 as
 simple
 as
 the


weather.
 And
 to
 their
 founders,
 that's


really
 exciting.
 But
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 other


people,
 a
 world
 in
 which
 everything
 is


reduced
 to
 dollars
 and
 cents
 is
 sort
 of


depressing.


>> To
 a
 lot
 of
 people,
 it
 sounds
 like


dystopia.


What's
 clear
 is
 that
 we're
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 this.
 The
 legal
 landscape


is
 still
 taking
 shape.
 There
 are
 some


challenges
 to
 prediction
 markets


happening
 in
 the
 states
 right
 now.


Still,
 as
 someone
 who's
 covered
 this


sort
 of
 fringe
 financial
 stuff
 for
 a


long
 time,
 I
 can
 feel
 momentum
 behind


these
 markets.
 There's
 a
 real
 appetite


for
 them
 culturally,
 and
 I
 don't
 see


that
 changing.
 People
 want
 to
 bet
 on


everything.


Well,
 David,
 thanks
 for
 coming
 on
 the


show.


>> Thanks
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.


President
 Trump
 signed
 a
 bill
 that
 ended


the
 partial
 government
 shutdown
 on


Tuesday,
 hours
 after
 it
 passed
 the


House.
 The
 legislation
 funds
 much
 of
 the


government
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 year


except
 for
 the
 Department
 of
 Homeland


Security,
 which
 was
 only
 funded
 until


the
 end
 of
 next
 week.
 Democrats
 are


insisting
 on
 new
 restrictions
 for


federal
 immigration
 agents
 before


extending
 that
 funding.
 And
 Trump
 now


has
 10
 days
 to
 strike
 a
 deal
 with
 them


before
 it
 expires.


And
 House
 Republicans
 cancelled
 a
 vote


to
 hold
 Bill
 and
 Hillary
 Clinton
 in


criminal
 contempt
 of
 Congress.


The
 move
 came
 after
 the
 Clintons
 agreed


to
 testify
 on
 camera
 in
 the
 Jeffrey


Epstein
 investigation
 and
 requested
 to


be
 deposed
 at
 public
 hearings.


The
 agreement
 marked
 an
 end
 to
 a
 monthsl


long
 standoff
 between
 Republicans
 and


the
 Clintons
 who
 had
 resisted
 testifying


and
 accused
 the
 GOP
 of
 carrying
 out
 a


political
 vendetta
 against
 them.


>> I
 think
 it's
 a
 shame
 to
 be
 honest.
 I


always
 liked
 him.
 When
 asked
 about
 the


developments,
 Trump
 expressed
 empathy


for
 the
 Clintons.


>> I
 hate
 to
 see
 it
 in
 many
 ways.
 I
 hate
 to


see
 it,
 but


>> they
 will
 appear
 on
 February
 26th
 and


27th
 for
 depositions.
