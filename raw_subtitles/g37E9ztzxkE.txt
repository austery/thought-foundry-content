The president of the United States
recently shared this photoshopped
image on social media showing
NATO leaders a map where the U.S.
has taken control of not only Venezuela,
but, more shockingly, territory
from loyal NATO allies that helped the US
fight several wars in the past decades.
Specifically, Denmark and Canada.
To many, this seems like something
only a madman would do.
But according to a viral speech
by Canadian Prime Minister
Mark Carney,
this is all part of a bigger trend.
This is a return to an era
of great power rivalry
that the rules based order is fading,
that the strong can do what they can,
and the weak must suffer what they must.
And while Carney
has a completely different
vision on how to behave
in such a new world order.
The overall idea that we are moving back
to an era of great power competition
is actually in line with what
one of the architects of Trump's
foreign policy, Stephen Miller,
recently told CNN's Jake Tapper.
But we live in a world in the real world,
Jake, that is governed by strength,
that is governed by force,
that is governed by power.
Therefore, it makes sense that Trump's new
national security strategy
literally says they are returning
to the so-called Monroe Doctrine,
under which the US has historically sought
to keep other
great powers
out of the Western Hemisphere.
This means that, according to Miller,
the US will now be using its military
to secure our interests
unapologetically in our hemisphere.
And that's exactly what we've seen
in the last few weeks.
Isn't it?
Therefore, some, like Doctor Wes Mitchell,
have said that Trump's actions are
in fact rooted in a clear
and compelling logic
grounded
in the discipline of grand strategy.
So what is this logic?
Well, one word consolidation.
Venezuela. Greenland. Canada.
The US is acting like a great power
that is consolidating its power
in its own hemisphere
to recover its strength first,
which will allow it to ultimately compete
with other great powers
like Russia and China
in a new era of great power competition.
However, according to the authors
of a recent viral international relations
paper, Professor Stacy
Goddard and Abraham Newman,
this explanation does not make much sense
because actually, upon closer inspection,
Russia's and China's
activities in Venezuela and around
Greenland are extremely limited.
On top of that, their resources are way
too expensive to truly benefit the US.
Therefore, they argue
that to truly understand Trump's attacks
on neighbors and allies, we need to view
the new international order
through the lens of what came
before the era of great power competition.
The era of competing royal houses
that cared about
personal wealth and personal status.
To see how that works other than human.
You know, I think Sisi and I always give
the example of, Game of Thrones.
You know,
it's like every almost everybody on earth
relates to this show
about a small group of elites
who really don't care
about their societies in general.
They just care about redistributing
resources amongst these houses.
And that is a system
that for most of, of human
history,
dominated international relations.
So could it be
that if we view Trump as a neo royalist
and the refinery and mineral mining owning
billionaires around him as his court,
Venezuela, Greenland,
and also strangely high tariffs
against China's biggest rival, India,
it will all fall into place.
So who is right is the new world order
we are seeing right now a Trump versus
Ghani style
return to great power politics, or rather,
the return of the corrupt politics
of royal dynasties.
To find out, I did, on the one hand,
a massive deep dive into the fundamentals
and the history of great power politics
and how it compares to Trump's new
national security
strategy versus Ghani's speech.
And, on the other hand,
an in-depth interview with Professors
Godard and Newman.
But before we get into which story
can explain the New World order best,
we need to understand what we are leaving
behind.
That is the rise and fall of the rules
based liberal international order.
Newfoundland, Canada, 1941.
Churchill, arguably still the leader
of the most powerful empire
the world has ever seen.
Meets his counterpart from the richest
nation on Earth, Franklin D Roosevelt.
Together, they sit down to discuss what
they see as the ideal international order,
an order that would never again produce
another devastating world war.
And here
they've just agreed on the first pillar
of the rules based international order,
which means that nations have borders
that should be kept as they are.
They have a right to self-governance.
They have a right to trade freely,
and they can decide with whom they trade.
And finally, the seas should be kept open
to facilitate this international trade.
Now, the second pillar
of the liberal rules
based international order was economic.
And for that, we have to go back
to Bretton Woods, the United States, 1944,
44 nations come together
to put an end to economic chaos.
The economic case of the 1930s and 40s.
This conference sets the stage for
the following international institutions
that will create order.
Where before there was chaos,
the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade that would later
turn into the World Trade Organization.
This meant that tariff
should be the same for everyone.
Then there's the world Bank.
All poor countries should get loans
to develop independent
of their political allegiance
to certain great powers.
Then there's the IMF.
Getting loans
to save your currency from collapsing
will now depend on your economic program,
rather than your political allegiance
to certain great powers.
Finally, the third pillar of the rules
based order
was the UN, a community of states,
both strong
and weak, that all pledged to follow
even more rules.
1944 Dumbarton Oaks,
the United States 1945
Yalta, the Soviet Union, and finally 1945
San Francisco, the United States.
These conferences
led to the creation of the United Nations.
Countries
that signed the UN charter agreed
that they would respect
number one, human rights.
Number two, international law.
Number three, they signed that armed force
shall not be used
safe in the common interest.
And then finally, that the goal
of this new international order
was to promote the economic
and social advancement of all people.
Very lofty goals.
And just as with Bretton Woods,
this led to the creation of some
international institutions
which theoretically made it
more difficult for states
to act on their own in key areas like war,
which was only allowed
if the UN authorized it and justice states
were held accountable
by the International Court of Justice.
On top of that,
some states went even further
by signing up to the International
Criminal Court, which could and did
sue leaders from weaker states
like Sudan and the Congo.
But crucially, as Kony admitted,
we knew the story
of the international rules
based order was partially false
that the strongest would exempt themselves
when convenient,
that trade rules
were enforced asymmetrically.
And we knew that international law applied
with varying rigor
depending on the identity of the accused
or the victim.
For example,
the International Criminal Court
has issued arrest warrants
against Putin and Netanyahu,
but they are practically untouchable.
The IMF was far stricter, enforcing
painful economic reforms on small powers
like Egypt, Greece
and Argentina than against
strong countries like the UK.
Also, the UN sanctioned small powers
like Zimbabwe and North Korea for human
rights abuses, but never strong countries
like China, the Soviet Union and the US.
For similar offenses.
And despite countries
signing up not to invade one another
except for self-defense,
both Western and Eastern powers invaded
several countries during this so-called
liberal rules based order.
Still,
we cannot be 100% sure that this was
because of the rules based order
and international institutions.
And in hindsight, I think we can say that
the liberal international order
looked like a big success.
There were no new world wars, and even
without taking those into account,
the years from 45 to 2011 had relatively
fewer conflicts between states
than the decades before them.
We can also see that in the liberal order,
relations between countries on average
got much friendlier.
We even saw several countries
joining a security community in NATO.
And on the flip side,
we saw far less countries being in
severe or lesser rivalry
like France, Germany, in the UK,
which used to always
be at each other's throats.
Finally, on the economic side,
after a massive reduction in global terms,
we saw an explosion in global trade
and more importantly,
we saw a massive reduction
in global poverty.
And yet, while free trade under the rules
based international order
arguably helped drag millions
out of poverty, especially in Asia,
the bottom 50% of Americans
saw their share of income drop
remarkably, in the second half
of the liberal rules based order.
So it is perhaps no wonder that Americans
elected a candidate twice
that talked openly
about blowing up this liberal order.
But we have to be honest, it was not
just Trump that started this process.
The three great powers actually seem
to have been in on it together.
First, in 2014, member of the UN
Permanent Security Council Russia
annexed Crimea and then in 2022,
several other provinces from Ukraine.
Next, when it comes to the economic
pillar, Trump's
2018 tariff barrage already
completely undermined
the principle of low tariffs
that should be equal against all nations.
Meanwhile, China
actively undermined the IMF and world Bank
when it became one of the biggest lenders
to poor and crisis stricken countries.
Finally, both China and Russia already
had a terrible human rights record,
and honestly,
the US lost a lot of credibility in 2003.
And the Bush and Cheney,
when they essentially authorized
the use of torture in CIA black sites
and in Guantanamo Bay.
Still, Trump now almost announcing
new tariffs against a new nation
every month and threatening to annex
territories from its most loyal allies.
That genuinely looks like the final nail
in the coffin of the rules
based international order.
So no wonder that Carney said that
we are in the midst of a rupture,
not a transition.
The liberal, rules based
international order is dead about that.
Almost everyone agrees.
The real question is what's next?
Are we heading back to an era
of great power competition like Carney
and the Trump
administration seem to believe?
Or should we think back
further, that Trump's chaotic actions
are better understood through the lens
of the emergence of new kings
and cohorts of billionaire backers
such as the Trump dynasty,
the House of Putin and the House of Modi?
Chapter two.
What will the new global
order actually look like?
The first
view is that we are now heading back
to a new era of great power competition,
where great power leaders like Trump
and Putin have a very different vision
than middle power leaders like Ghani.
This means that the world will look a lot
more like it
did in the 18th, 19th,
and early 20th centuries.
International relations.
Scholars tend to refer to this order
as the Westphalian Global Order.
After the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648,
which greatly reduced the power
of royal houses in favor of nation states
and their bureaucracies.
In this new Westphalian order, you may say
international institutions like the UN,
IMF and World Trade Organization lose
what's left of their waning power.
Instead, the world will once again
be completely determined by the actions
of great powers like the US, China,
Russia, and perhaps India and Europe.
According to international relations
professor John Mearsheimer,
who famously belongs to the school of
thought known as realism in such a world
order that states can never be certain
that they won't end up living next door
to a really powerful state
that has malign intentions.
All of that causes states
to do everything they can
to be as powerful as possible,
and depending on how powerful they end up
being, States are then classified
as great powers,
middle powers, or small powers,
and they will all play
a different variation of the power game.
First,
small powers will either try to survive
by claiming neutrality, like Sweden
and Belgium did in the Second World War,
or by aligning themselves
with a great power for protection
like Finland and Hungary did.
Meanwhile, middle powers will either try
to play great powers off against one
another like India has historically done,
or they will do the same
that Ghani suggested in his speech,
which is value based realism,
meaning that liberal countries
like Canada and Finland, for example,
for every geopolitical situation
they will weigh their liberal values,
such as the importance of human rights,
respecting boundaries and democracy.
And they will weigh that with geopolitical
reality, especially for Canada.
This is a break with the past concretely,
whereas Canada's previous Prime minister,
Justin Trudeau,
frequently challenged great powers
like China on their human rights records.
Ghani is subtly indicating
that Canada may no longer do this.
If the geopolitical reality is
that this would get Canada
into trouble
with a great power simultaneously.
Currently, in the case of the way forward,
maybe for a liberal value
based mill powers to form coalitions
with countries
with similar values that may help them
stand up to great powers
with different values,
such as Trump's America.
You see, while the Trump team also rides
in their national security strategy
that they believe in realism, now
they give a version of it a different name
flexible realism,
which so far seems to mean might is right.
A strong country like the U.S.
can take Greenland from Denmark,
because Denmark is a tiny country
with a tiny economy and a tiny military,
they cannot defend Greenland.
And this is what international scholars
mean when they say might is right.
The US should get Greenland
because it is strong enough to defend
Greenland from other great powers,
and Denmark is not.
But why does a great power like
the US need to do this in the first place?
Aren't they already powerful enough?
No. Say scholars like wertheimer,
without international commitments
to respect borders.
Even great powers like the US, Russia
or China will always fear that another
great power will become much stronger
than them, upsetting the balance of power.
Therefore, they may even want to dominate
your region of the world.
Is because in that situation,
there is no other state
that is capable of hurting you.
And this logic leads
to so-called spheres of influence,
where great powers
try to deny other great powers the ability
to threaten them
by keeping them as far away as possible.
In the 19th and 20th centuries,
the US tried to keep other great powers
out of the Americas under the so-called
Monroe Doctrine and using similar logic.
Hitler at some point actually proposed
a sphere of influence in Europe,
which he called the German
Monroe Doctrine,
and people like Professor
Mearsheimer have used this logic
of the Monroe Doctrine
to make the case that the West provoked
Russia into invading Ukraine
by meddling in its sphere of influence.
The Trump team has written
in the national security strategy
that they are essentially returning
to the Monroe Doctrine.
Some call it the donno
doctrine now, and some, like Doctor West
Mitchell, have used this type of logic
to argue that term strategic actions are
in fact rooted in a clear and compelling
logic, firmly grounded
in the discipline of grand strategy.
He says that Russia and China are the US
natural great power competitors,
but that the US no longer has the strength
to fight them all over the world,
and therefore the US is now essentially
retreating to its own Western Hemisphere.
Just this is done
historically, many times before.
Venezuela and Greenland are both
about securing access to vital resources
and, crucially,
about denying them to competitors.
So what we've seen so far is simply
a return to great power competition.
Everything the US has done
so far is just in the national interest.
Flexible realism is a cynical
but not illogical take on America First.
However, to me
there were at least three details
about recent events
that I could not explain with this theory.
First, capturing Maduro
does not seem to have been in US
national interest,
given that the oil there is too expensive
to get out of the ground,
and China did not get that much anyway.
Second, annexing Greenland
and in the process completely alienating
European allies does not make much sense
either, given that the US already
had almost unlimited
military access to the island
and easy economic access to its minerals.
Finally, if Trump was truly following
a great power style strategy,
why did he recently tear of the hell
out of India,
which is China's natural rival in Asia?
This is where Godard and Newman's
neo royalist theory
starts making a lot more sense.
They claim that
what we are seeing today is,
rather than a system of territorial nation
states, rather than a system of rule
governed institutions.
What we see
is a system of international politics
that structured
around the interest of ruling clicks,
which include a personalized,
absolute sovereign,
and basically his network
of whether or not his family,
whether or not its financial interests,
ideologues that legitimate his rule.
They call this neorealism
because rather than a return to great
power politics of the Westphalian order,
it would potentially be more like a return
to the world order
before the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.
You see, the Peace of Westphalia
came about to put an end to various
devastating wars that plagued the Holy
Roman Empire, Wars that often came about
because of royal succession,
not the national interest.
For example, the Dutch War of Independence
against Spain arguably came about
after that suddenly found themselves
with a new Spanish king that had
essentially inherited the Netherlands
through a series of marriages.
So in the royalist system,
the main actors were not states,
but rather ruling monarchs
and their clicks.
Therefore, most wars in those days were
not about the national interest at all.
They were about increasing royal wealth
and status.
Similarly, Godard and Newman argue
that in the case of Maduro's capture,
Greenland and the tariffs against India,
it's not about national interest.
It's about this small group of hyper
elites, these
this clique actor
kind of clusters interest.
And so that really drives
a very different logic
of how international politics functions.
So while Venezuela's oil is too expensive
to benefit the American oil industry
as a whole,
the specific American refineries
that did benefit just so happened
to be controlled by Trump Mega-Donors,
such as John Edison from Vidor.
Similarly, while Greenland's
minerals are not worth enough
for the US to alienate
allies over, that price
may well be worth it to billionaires
with extensive interest in Greenland
like Ronald Lauder, who reportedly
put the idea into Trump's head in 2018.
Finally, there's Trump's
mega tariffs against India.
Again, from a great Barr perspective,
it makes no sense to alienate
China's biggest Asian rival.
But if you consider that Modi
very publicly humiliated Trump by stating
that he had nothing to do with Pakistani
Indian fees in the summer, Indian tariffs
immediately after that incident start
making a lot more sense.
But while neorealism can fill
in a lot of gaps
in their article,
Goddard and Neumann do recognize that
the Royals dynamics
have always been in the background.
After all, even during the height
of great power politics,
the 19th century Belgian King Leopold,
for example, used the Belgian state
to conquer and dominate
his own personal colony in the Congo.
And even today, Trump style
personal rule is quite common.
However, the difference between MBS
or Orban and Trump is that they just don't
have the material or status capability
to transform the international system.
And that's why Trump is so exceptional,
because he has the U.S.
military and the U.S. economy behind it.
In other words, just as Westphalian style,
great power politics were always
still there in the background
during, for example, the Cold War.
Goddard and Neumann argue
that royalist elements are
and have always been a part
of the international order as well.
Therefore, my conclusion,
my conclusion
is that to truly make sense of where
the global order is going,
we need all three lenses.
If going, you can make international
organizations become more powerful again.
The global order will again
become more predictable.
But if they become weaker, we will either
see more great power games
where small and medium powers like
Ukraine, Venezuela and perhaps even Canada
become pawns or battlefields
for great powers that continuously seek
to become more and more powerful
because they fear that if they won't,
they will not remain a great power
for very long.
However, if great powers are governed
by autocratic or illiberal rulers,
then we will increasingly see incidents
like Trump's
Board of Peace, which he plans to stay on
even if he is no longer U.S.
president, where great power influence
will not be used in the national interest,
but rather to enrich Personalis leaders
and their clicks or elevate their social
standing amongst
a new class of global rulers
and their courts that compete very much
like the royal houses of game of Thrones
for power and status.
So, given that Trump will be in power
for at least
three more years, and given that far right
populist parties
are still lurking in the shadows
in many other middle powers as well,
I think it's a safe
bet that we will be seeing a more volatile
international order emerging, which,
whether it be for personal
or national interest, tariffs, sanctions
and even military strikes
and wars, will sadly become more common.
The economic evidence so far tells us that
this will make most of us
poorer and less secure,
especially given that,
unlike in the 19th century,
great powers now have weapons
that could kill us all
at the click of a button.
Still, it doesn't have to be that way.
For example, some have argued
that at the Congress of Vienna
after the body was defeated,
the return of realism looked inevitable.
Yet this never happened.
Similarly, who knows?
Perhaps Trump's successor
will see the value of the liberal,
rules based international order again,
and together with Geithner and others,
they may build yet
another liberal international order
from the ashes
of the one that we just said goodbye to.
