From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Thursday,
 January
 8th.
 Here's
 what
 we're


covering.


My
 name
 is
 Nicholas
 Bogle
 and
 I
 am
 a


reporter
 for
 the
 New
 York
 Times.
 I
 am
 at


the
 corner
 of
 Portland
 A
 and
 East
 34th


Street
 in
 Minneapolis.
 It's
 about
 11:30


at
 night
 and
 there
 are
 about
 a
 100


protesters
 still
 here
 at
 the


intersection
 where
 an
 ICE
 agent
 fatally


shot
 Renee
 Good
 earlier
 today.
 My


colleagues
 are
 on
 the
 ground
 in


Minneapolis
 where
 a
 37year-old
 woman,


Renee
 Nicole
 Good,
 a
 US
 citizen
 who


lived
 in
 the
 city,
 was
 killed
 by
 a


federal
 officer
 who
 was
 part
 of
 the


Trump
 administration's
 escalating


immigration
 crackdown.
 Multiple
 videos


posted
 on
 social
 media
 and
 verified
 by


the
 Times
 show
 the
 shooting
 and
 the


moments
 before
 and
 after.
 In
 the


footage,
 the
 woman's
 SUV
 is
 stopped
 in


the
 street,
 partly
 blocking
 one
 lane.
 As


cars
 approach,
 she
 waves
 at
 them
 to
 go


around,
 but
 a
 truck
 flashing
 its
 lights


stops
 and
 federal
 agents
 get
 out.
 They


tell
 the
 driver
 to
 get
 out
 of
 her
 car.


One
 agent
 tries
 to
 open
 the
 driver's


door
 and
 reaches
 through
 the
 window.


Another
 agent
 crosses
 in
 front
 of
 her


SUV
 as
 she
 starts
 to
 back
 up.
 She
 then


shifts
 into
 drive
 and
 starts
 to
 move


forward.
 The
 agent
 standing
 at
 the
 front


near
 the
 driver's
 side
 headlight
 pulls


out
 a
 gun
 and
 fires.
 He
 continues


shooting
 as
 the
 vehicle
 moves
 past
 him.


A
 Times
 analysis
 of
 three
 different


camera
 angles
 shows
 she
 was
 driving
 away


from
 the
 officer
 when
 he
 opened
 fire
 and


it
 appears
 he
 was
 not
 in
 the
 path
 of
 the


SUV.
 In
 the
 footage,
 the
 vehicle
 then


accelerates
 and
 crashes
 into
 parked
 cars


and
 a
 utility
 pole.
 The
 Minneapolis


police
 chief
 said
 later
 the
 victim
 had


been
 shot
 in
 the
 head
 and
 was
 pronounced


dead
 at
 a
 hospital.


>> Do
 you
 have
 A
 CONSCIENCE?
 DO
 YOU
 HAVE
 a


conscience?


>> The
 shooting
 happened
 in
 a
 part
 of
 the


city
 where
 for
 weeks
 people
 have
 been


blowing
 whistles
 and
 blaring
 car
 horns


to
 warn
 their
 neighbors
 whenever
 they


see
 ICE
 agents
 nearby.
 All
 that
 noise


had
 drawn
 some
 people
 out
 to
 the
 street


where
 some
 yelled
 at
 the
 officer
 who


fired
 the
 shots.


>> Don't
 let
 the
 murderer
 leave.
 Don't
 let


the
 murderer
 leave.


>> In
 the
 aftermath,
 federal
 officials


quickly
 defended
 the
 shooting.


>> This
 appears
 as
 an
 attempt
 to
 kill
 or
 to


cause
 bodily
 harm
 to
 agents,
 an
 act
 of


domestic
 terrorism.


>> Christy
 Gnome,
 the
 Secretary
 of
 Homeland


Security,
 said
 the
 victim
 had
 weaponized


her
 vehicle.
 The
 ICE
 officer
 fearing
 for


his
 life
 and
 the
 other
 officers
 around


him
 and
 the
 safety
 of
 the
 public
 fired


defensive
 shots.
 President
 Trump
 also


weighed
 in,
 claiming
 that
 the
 victim
 ran


over
 the
 agent
 willfully
 and
 viciously.


State
 and
 local
 officials
 called
 the


administration's
 framing
 garbage
 and


propaganda.


>> They
 are
 already
 trying
 to
 spin
 this
 as


an
 action
 of
 self-defense.


Having
 seen
 the
 video
 of
 myself,
 I
 want


to
 tell
 everybody
 directly
 that
 is


[ __ ]


>> Mayor
 Jacob
 Fry
 condemned
 the
 shooting


as
 reckless
 and
 demanded
 that
 ICE
 leave


the
 city.


>> We
 do
 not
 want
 you
 here.


Your
 stated
 reason
 for
 being
 in
 this


city
 is
 to
 create
 some
 kind
 of
 safety


and
 you
 are
 doing
 exactly
 the
 opposite.


And
 Minnesota
 Governor
 Tim
 Walls
 called


the
 killing
 quote
 totally
 avoidable
 and


said
 the
 administration's
 recent


decision
 to
 ramp
 up
 immigration


enforcement
 there,
 sending
 in
 up
 to


2,000
 federal
 agents
 had
 set
 the
 stage


for
 potential
 violence.


Yesterday's
 shooting
 was
 the
 ninth
 time


immigration
 officers
 have
 fired
 on


people
 in
 US
 cities
 since
 September.
 In


all
 of
 those
 cases,
 the
 agents
 fired
 at


people
 who
 were
 in
 their
 vehicles.
 And


in
 each
 case,
 the
 officers
 claimed


self-defense.


>> Last
 night
 in
 the
 Oval
 Office,


>> how
 long
 do
 you
 think
 he'll
 be
 running


Venezuela?


>> A
 team
 of
 Times
 reporters
 sat
 down
 with


President
 Trump
 for
 a
 wide
 ranging


interview.


>> Only
 time
 will
 tell.


>> Like
 3
 months,
 6
 months,
 a
 year
 longer.


I
 would
 say
 much
 longer
 than
 that.


>> Much
 longer
 and
 we
 have
 to
 rebuild.
 You


have
 to
 rebuild
 the
 country
 and
 we
 will


rebuild
 it
 in
 a
 very
 profitable
 way.


We're
 going
 to
 be
 uh
 using
 oil
 and
 we're


going
 to
 be
 taking
 oil.
 We're
 getting


>> over
 the
 course
 of
 the
 2-hour
 interview.


Trump
 touted
 his
 plans
 for
 long-term
 US


involvement
 in
 Venezuela.


>> You
 know,
 we're
 getting
 along
 very
 well


with
 the
 administration
 that
 is
 there


right
 now.
 uh
 they're
 giving
 us


everything
 that
 we
 feel
 is
 necessary.


>> The
 president's
 comments
 built
 on
 what


Secretary
 of
 State
 Marco
 Rubio
 laid
 out


yesterday.
 He
 detailed
 a
 three-phase


mission
 for
 the
 US
 in
 Venezuela
 that


includes
 selling
 the
 country's
 oil
 and


eventually
 installing
 a
 new
 government


there.


>> And
 the
 reason
 why
 we
 understand
 and


believe
 that
 we
 have
 the
 strongest


leverage
 possible
 is
 our
 quarantine.
 As


you've
 seen
 today,
 two
 more
 ships
 were


seized.
 Uh,
 we
 are.


>> Rubio
 also
 talked
 up
 the
 US's
 blockade


where
 American
 troops
 off
 the
 coast
 of


Venezuela
 have
 been
 trying
 to
 cut
 off


any
 oil
 tankers
 coming
 or
 going.
 Just


yesterday,
 US
 forces
 dropped
 from
 a


helicopter
 to
 take
 over
 one
 ship
 near


the
 Caribbean
 and
 swooped
 in
 to


intercept
 another
 ship
 that
 had
 been
 on


the
 run
 from
 the
 region
 for
 days,


stopping
 it
 all
 the
 way
 up
 in
 the
 North


Atlantic
 between
 Iceland
 and
 Scotland.


Seizing
 that
 tanker
 showed
 not
 only
 how


far
 the
 Trump
 administration
 is
 willing


to
 go
 to
 enforce
 the
 Venezuelan


blockade,
 but
 it
 was
 also
 a
 provocative


move
 against
 Russia.
 While
 the
 ship
 was


fleeing
 the
 Coast
 Guard,
 the
 crew
 had


painted
 a
 slap
 dash
 Russian
 flag
 on
 the


hole
 to
 try
 and
 deter
 the
 US
 from


approaching
 it.
 Russian
 officials
 then


asked
 the
 US
 to
 stop
 its
 pursuit
 and


even
 sent
 a
 naval
 vessel
 to
 escort
 the


ship,
 though
 it
 wasn't
 there
 when


American
 forces
 moved
 in.
 In
 the
 past


few
 days,
 several
 other
 ships
 from


what's
 known
 as
 the
 shadow
 fleet
 of


tankers,
 which
 transport
 oil
 in
 defiance


of
 global
 sanctions,
 have
 taken
 on
 the


Russian
 flag
 after
 operating
 in


Venezuelan
 waters,
 potentially
 setting


the
 stage
 for
 future
 standoffs
 between


the
 US
 and
 Russia.


As
 Secretary
 of
 Health
 and
 Human


Services,
 my
 message
 is
 clear.
 Eat
 real


food.


>> Yesterday,
 Health
 Secretary
 Robert
 F.


Kennedy
 Jr.
 announced
 a
 striking


reversal
 of
 the
 government's
 dietary


guidelines.
 He
 effectively
 flipped
 the


food
 pyramid
 on
 its
 head.
 These
 new


guidelines
 will
 revolutionize
 our


nation's
 food
 culture
 and
 make
 America


healthy
 again.


>> For
 years,
 Americans
 have
 been
 told
 to


avoid
 eating
 too
 much
 red
 meat
 and
 foods


that
 are
 high
 in
 fat.
 But
 now,
 steak,


cheese,
 and
 whole
 milk
 are
 getting
 a
 big


thumbs
 up.
 It's
 part
 of
 what
 Kennedy


says
 is
 a
 push
 to
 get
 Americans
 to


prioritize
 protein
 and
 avoid
 sugary


processed
 foods.
 The
 new
 guidelines
 echo


some
 of
 Kennedy's
 frequent
 talking


points
 that
 scientific
 evidence
 does
 not


support,
 like
 recommending
 that
 people


cook
 with
 beef
 tallow.
 But
 on
 other


points,
 the
 new
 guidelines
 stick
 closely


to
 mainstream
 nutrition
 advice.
 For


example,
 they
 still
 encourage
 Americans


to
 eat
 lots
 of
 fruits
 and
 vegetables.


The
 administration
 came
 up
 with
 the
 new


guidelines
 after
 Kennedy
 dismissed
 the


recommendations
 of
 an
 expert
 committee


from
 the
 Biden
 administration
 and


handpicked
 a
 new
 set
 of
 advisers
 who


worked
 on
 the
 project
 in
 secret.
 As
 of


yesterday,
 the
 federal
 government
 also


overhauled
 its
 guidance
 for
 alcohol


consumption.
 It
 had
 previously
 said
 men


should
 have
 no
 more
 than
 two
 drinks
 a


day
 and
 women
 should
 have
 no
 more
 than


one.
 The
 new
 advice
 calls
 for
 people
 to


quote
 limit
 alcoholic
 beverages,
 but


sets
 no
 clear
 amount
 and
 no
 longer
 warns


that
 alcohol
 may
 increase
 the
 risk
 of


cancer.
 Several
 public
 health
 experts


the
 Times
 talked
 with
 said
 they
 were


puzzled
 by
 the
 lack
 of
 clear-cut


amounts,
 with
 one
 saying,
 "The
 word


limit
 isn't
 satisfactory."
 Limit
 to


what?


And
 finally,
 as
 driverless
 cars
 zoom


around
 more
 and
 more
 US
 cities
 operating


as
 taxis,
 they're
 finding
 fans
 among
 an


unexpected
 group.
 Parents
 who
 just
 need


someone,
 or
 it
 turns
 out,
 something
 to


pick
 up
 their
 kids
 from
 school
 or
 soccer


practice
 or
 both.
 The
 Times
 talked
 with


parents
 in
 Los
 Angeles
 who
 say
 that


sending
 a
 robot
 car
 has
 turned
 out
 to
 be


the
 answer
 for
 juggling
 chaotic


schedules,
 even
 though
 California
 law


technically
 prohibits
 minors
 from
 riding


in
 those
 cars
 alone.
 One
 woman
 who
 is


often
 stuck
 at
 work
 as
 a
 social
 worker


while
 her
 husband
 is
 busy
 at
 his
 job


installing
 glass
 started
 using
 Whimo
 for


her
 13-year-old
 daughter
 after


exhausting
 other
 options
 for
 getting
 her


kids
 around.
 She
 tried
 Uber
 and
 Lyft,


but
 those
 drivers
 often
 canled
 after


discovering
 they
 were
 picking
 up
 a
 kid.


Of
 course,
 there
 are
 still
 a
 lot
 of


skeptics
 of
 self-driving
 technology
 in


general.
 In
 recent
 years,
 Whimos
 have


been
 documented
 ignoring
 flashing
 lights


or
 breaking
 other
 traffic
 rules.
 But
 one


dad
 told
 the
 Times
 he
 thinks
 of
 it
 as


safer
 than
 any
 human
 driver,
 saying,


quote,
 "There's
 no
 way
 I
 can
 step
 on
 a


break
 as
 fast
 as
 a
 computer
 can."
 And


for
 most
 parents
 using
 Whimo
 to
 pick
 up


their
 kids,
 the
 absence
 of
 a
 driver
 is
 a


selling
 point.
 They
 say
 they
 don't
 have


to
 worry
 about
 who
 their
 kid
 is
 getting


in
 the
 car
 with.
 For
 their
 part,
 the


teenagers
 don't
 seem
 to
 think
 it's
 weird


at
 all.
 With
 one
 16-year-old
 telling
 the


Times,
 "It
 feels
 normal."


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy


Mumford.
 We'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow.
