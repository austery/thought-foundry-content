Hello
 everybody.
 I'm
 here
 at
 Pounder's


end
 of
 year
 December
 event
 Paragon
 and


I'm
 here
 for
 a
 very
 very
 special


interview
 to
 talk
 about
 a
 very
 special


partnership.
 I'm
 here
 with
 Justin
 who


leads
 commercial
 AI
 at
 NVIDIA
 and
 Kevin


who
 leads
 commercial
 sales
 at
 Pounder.


Thank
 you
 both
 for
 being
 here.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me.
 It's
 great
 to
 be


good
 to
 see
 you.


>> So
 let
 I
 I
 want
 to
 start
 off
 by
 saying


this.
 I
 come
 from
 the
 retail
 investor


community
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 for
 the
 past


four
 years
 have
 been
 waiting
 for
 the


moment
 that
 Nvidia
 and
 Poundro
 would


work
 together.
 We
 knew
 that
 you
 know


these
 are
 the
 two
 companies
 controlling


AI.
 Dr.
 Karp
 constantly
 talks
 about


chips
 and
 ontology
 and
 a
 partnership


usually
 that
 is
 special
 probably
 should


take
 time
 to
 evolve
 and
 I
 think
 what


we're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 today
 is


pretty
 special.
 So
 I
 guess
 we'll
 get


started
 with
 you
 Justin.
 How
 did
 this


partnership
 even
 come
 to
 fruition?


>> You
 know
 I
 think
 uh
 just
 looking
 at
 the


work
 that
 the
 Palunteer
 team
 have
 done


through
 ontology
 we
 realized
 it's


foundational
 across
 you
 know
 virtually


every
 enterprise.
 So
 it's
 one
 of
 the


most
 important
 enterprise
 platforms
 on


the
 market
 and
 we
 thought
 there
 was
 a


huge
 opportunity
 to
 work
 together
 to


continue
 to
 accelerate
 the
 work
 that


Palunteer
 has
 done
 through
 uh
 our
 CUDA


libraries
 and
 through
 Neotron
 models
 and


bring
 you
 know
 I'll
 say
 specialized


intelligence
 to
 the
 world's
 enterprises


together.


>> Kevin,
 your
 take
 on
 how
 this
 partnership


started?


>> Uh
 I
 I
 think
 for
 me
 and
 you
 know
 it
 it


was
 over
 a
 year
 ago
 Dr.
 Karp
 said
 that
 a


lot
 of
 the
 value
 for
 in
 AI
 was
 going
 to


be
 about
 connecting
 ontology
 to
 the


chips.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 and
 and
 I
 think
 we
 we
 sort
 of
 come


to
 came
 to
 learn
 that
 like
 connecting


our
 ontology
 to
 your
 accelerated


computing
 platform
 uh
 is
 a
 big
 uh
 game


changer
 for
 our
 customers
 and
 going


through
 that
 process
 um
 of
 actually


implementing
 it
 putting
 into
 the
 field


was
 worth
 trying
 and
 we
 didn't
 have
 to


try
 for
 that
 long.
 We
 we
 started
 our


partnership
 uh
 I
 think
 maybe
 3
 4
 weeks


into
 it.
 We
 already
 had
 a
 customer
 up


and
 running
 uh
 on
 you
 know
 on
 on
 Nvidia


products
 with
 Nvidia
 models
 uh
 in


ontology
 uh
 for
 for
 Lowe's
 for
 one
 of


our
 customers
 and
 it
 was
 a
 mutual


customer
 which
 helped
 move
 things


quicker
 but
 um
 you
 know
 when
 our
 teams


can
 work
 together
 and
 show
 value
 in
 what


ended
 up
 I
 think
 being
 three
 weeks


>> uh
 you
 know
 that's
 a
 pretty
 good
 start


to
 any
 kind
 of
 partnership.
 Yeah,
 I


think
 the
 synergist
 the
 synergies


between
 Pounder
 and
 Nvidia
 are
 exciting


because
 you
 guys
 both
 move
 really
 fast.


Uh
 the
 the
 standard
 that
 Jensen
 and
 Car


pulled
 the
 company
 to,
 you
 know,
 if
 you


just
 listen
 to
 some
 of the
 employees


speak
 about
 the
 the
 work
 culture
 and
 the


the
 mission
 behind
 the
 work
 culture
 is


why
 people
 want
 to
 work
 so
 hard.
 It
 it


it
 would
 make
 sense
 that
 in
 3
 to
 four


weeks
 a
 customer
 is
 up
 and
 running
 and


getting
 started.
 In
 terms
 of
 the


technicalities
 of
 the
 partnership,
 uh


you
 mentioned
 the
 ontology
 is
 integral


towards
 the
 enterprise
 stack.
 when
 did


that
 realization
 happen
 and
 why
 do
 you


think
 the
 ontology
 is
 being
 adopted
 by


so
 many
 organizations
 and


philosophically
 how
 do
 you
 think
 they


will
 continue
 to
 adopt
 the
 ontology?


Yeah,
 I
 think
 um
 you
 know
 when
 I
 when
 we


started
 to
 engage
 uh
 in
 kind
 of
 these


first
 customer
 engagements,
 we
 quickly


realized
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 the
 power
 of


Palunteer
 is
 really
 taking
 what
 were
 a


bunch
 of
 let's
 say
 narrowly
 optimized


systems
 across
 a
 supply
 chain
 and
 giving


you
 a
 way
 to
 globally
 optimize
 across


the
 all
 the
 business
 systems
 and
 giving


you
 kind
 of
 this
 unified
 data
 model
 that


is
 the
 the
 data
 that
 you
 want
 to
 ground


artificial
 intelligence
 into
 to
 make


business
 decisions.
 Um,
 and
 so
 as
 soon


as
 we
 started
 engaging
 uh
 Lowe's
 in
 this


in
 this
 case,
 you
 know,
 they
 had
 1,700,


I
 think,
 retail
 locations,
 130


distribution
 centers,
 and
 over
 7,000


suppliers
 that
 they're
 trying
 to


optimize
 inventory
 across
 to
 make
 sure


that
 shelves
 are
 full
 to
 drive
 revenue.


And,
 you
 know,
 by
 bringing
 together
 the


power
 of
 accelerated
 computing,
 we
 could


basically
 do
 that
 supply
 chain


reoptimization
 in
 real
 time
 when
 there's


a
 new
 event
 such
 as
 like
 a
 weather
 event


in
 the
 supply
 chain.
 um
 which
 lets
 you


basically
 maintain
 you
 know
 stock


shelves
 and
 grow
 the
 business
 and
 so
 for


every
 company
 when
 you
 can
 basically
 pro


provide
 this
 uh
 let's
 say
 operational


you
 know
 decision
 intelligence
 that
 lets


you
 run
 your
 company
 in
 a
 more


profitable
 way
 and
 helps
 you
 grow
 your


business
 you
 know
 there's
 there's


obviously
 very
 very
 you
 know
 fast


engagements
 to
 deliver
 value


>> Kevin
 the
 the
 oper
 operationalization
 of


uh
 LLMs
 can
 you
 speak
 to
 that
 a
 little


bit
 in
 terms
 of
 obviously
 Nvidia's


hardware
 is
 necessary
 train
 these
 LLMs,


but
 it
 seems
 like
 Pounders's


orchestration
 to
 get
 the
 business


intelligence
 is
 crucial
 to
 making
 them


useful
 in
 an
 enterprise.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 think
 you
 know,
 we
 we
 we


thought
 a
 lot
 about
 how
 we
 take
 this


technology
 and
 drive
 like
 serious


business
 value.
 You
 we
 had
 a
 customer
 on


stage
 tonight
 that
 talked
 about
 how


they've
 reduced
 um


48
 hour
 fatalities
 at
 a
 hospital
 by
 68%.


And
 you
 know
 some
 of
 these


like
 so
 the
 application
 of
 the


technology
 really
 matters.
 So
 there's


you
 know
 we
 could
 we
 could
 we
 could


create
 a
 tech
 stack.
 We
 could
 uh


optimize
 it
 for
 maybe
 consumer
 use
 or


you
 know
 general
 kind
 of
 like
 hobbyist


kind
 of
 things
 or
 we
 can
 we
 can
 drive


this
 technology
 actually
 into
 the


institution
 and
 you
 can
 have
 real


impact.
 You
 know
 we
 had
 there
 was
 a


construction
 company
 on
 stage
 that
 said


you
 know
 that
 this
 is
 actually
 their


operating
 system
 right.
 So,
 so
 we


>> said
 they
 said
 they
 replace
 97%
 of
 all


the
 other
 software
 stack.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 In
 12
 months.
 Yeah.
 In
 12


months.
 And
 and
 that's
 a
 really
 really


powerful
 thing.
 And
 you
 know
 there


there's
 some
 things
 that
 we're
 we're


seeing
 in
 the
 market
 that
 I
 I
 don't


really
 I'm
 not
 sure
 they
 were
 even


doable
 6
 months
 ago,


>> you
 know.
 So,
 it's
 like
 if
 if
 I
 can
 help


an
 insurance
 company,
 you
 know,
 process


a
 uh,
 you
 know,
 an
 underwriting
 or
 a


claim
 in
 a
 matter
 of
 essentially


minutes,
 like
 that
 wasn't
 really
 even


possible
 a
 few
 months
 ago.
 If
 if
 we


could
 go
 into
 a
 hospital
 and
 help
 the


the
 person
 that's
 trying
 to
 schedule,


you
 know,
 nurses,
 doctors,
 like
 be
 in


the
 right
 place
 at
 the
 right
 time
 with


the
 right
 equipment,
 and
 therefore
 you


can
 move
 patients
 through
 faster.
 um


well,
 you
 know,
 that
 saves
 lives.
 Yeah.


>> And
 and
 it
 changes
 the
 whole
 operation


of
 the
 institution.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 think
 like,


you
 know,
 I
 think
 we've
 all
 experienced


large
 language
 models
 in
 in
 our
 in
 our


in
 on
 our
 phones,
 in
 our
 pockets.
 But
 if


if
 we
 can
 if
 we
 could
 take
 this


technology
 into
 the
 institution
 and
 help


the
 the
 these
 companies,
 these


organizations,
 these
 governments
 operate


better,
 operate
 better
 at
 the
 thing
 that


is
 consistent
 with
 their
 mission.
 I
 um


well,
 that's
 what
 our
 company's
 all


about.
 And
 and
 and
 we
 wake
 up
 every
 day


thinking
 about
 that.
 I
 think
 we
 were,


you
 know,
 fortunate
 to
 meet
 a
 company


that
 that
 also
 cared
 a
 lot
 about
 that


and
 could
 move
 at
 pace
 and
 speed
 with
 us


with
 amazing
 engineers.
 You
 know,
 we've


had
 um
 I'd
 say
 over
 the
 years
 we've


often
 times
 tried
 to
 work
 with
 companies


to
 say,
 "Hey,
 maybe
 you
 should
 have
 a


forward
 deployed
 engineering
 team,
 too."


>> And
 and
 and
 that's
 often
 times
 worked


really
 well.
 It's
 like
 even
 just
 the


concept
 of
 trying
 is
 is
 sometimes
 like


really
 really
 good.
 It's
 like,
 "Hey,
 we


should
 do
 engineering
 for
 the
 purpose
 of


delivering
 a
 result."
 Well,
 you
 know,
 we


just
 barely
 talked
 about
 it
 at
 a


conference
 a
 few
 weeks
 ago
 and
 then,
 you


know,
 within
 days
 there's
 a
 team
 of


NVIDIA,
 four
 deployed
 engineers
 working


side
 by
 side
 with
 our
 people
 and
 I
 don't


it's
 very
 hard
 to
 tell
 the
 difference


between
 your
 team
 and
 ours
 and
 and
 and


that's
 that's
 really
 cool.


>> Yeah.
 One
 thing
 that
 uh
 I
 was
 speaking


to
 one
 of
 the
 engineers
 who's
 who's


central
 to
 the
 partnership
 is
 that
 both


companies
 take
 on
 the
 burden
 of
 value


creation
 as
 Dr.
 Karp
 says
 like
 you
 don't


want
 to
 get
 paid
 until
 you
 actually


prove
 that
 you
 can
 be
 valuable
 for
 a


company.
 Um,
 Nvidia
 is
 a
 hardware


company,
 but
 at
 a
 high
 level,
 Justin,


can
 you
 explain
 more
 about
 CUDA
 and
 the


software
 integration
 with
 Pounder
 and


why
 that
 makes
 sense
 for
 this


partnership?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 from


our
 early
 days,
 people
 know
 us


originally
 as
 a
 gaming
 company.
 Yes.


>> And
 I
 think
 Jensen
 has
 talked
 about
 this


for
 a
 long
 time.
 Uh,
 for
 us
 to
 create


value
 in
 the
 market,
 we
 had
 to


accelerate
 games
 to
 create
 a
 better


visual
 interactive
 experience
 for


gamers,
 right?
 And
 then
 obviously
 people


wanted
 our
 product
 to
 to
 get
 that
 you


know
 best-in-class
 like
 interactive


experience.
 And
 the
 same
 thing
 is
 true


here
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 processing
 uh
 data


analytics,
 data
 processing
 and


artificial
 intelligence.
 uh
 the
 lower


the
 latency
 uh
 the
 more
 data
 that
 you


can
 look
 at
 in
 your
 business,
 the
 better


decisions
 that
 you
 can
 make
 uh
 you
 know


across
 operations
 of
 your
 business
 from


you
 know
 customer
 success
 to
 claims


processing
 to
 uh
 supply
 chain
 to


operations
 and
 so
 uh
 that's
 why
 kind
 of


this
 natural
 partnership
 um
 and
 as
 KK


said
 you
 know
 we
 are
 a
 software
 company


we
 build
 we
 uh
 started
 our
 early
 days


with
 CUDA
 building
 libraries
 for
 every


domain
 that
 we
 wanted
 to
 go
 into
 at
 this


point
 I
 think
 we
 have
 over
 200
 100
 of


these
 CUDA
 libraries
 to
 accelerate
 many


different
 uh
 stages
 of
 these
 workflows.


And
 so
 the
 exciting
 thing
 working
 with


the
 Palunteer
 team
 is
 every
 engagement


starts
 with
 the
 customer
 need
 like


what's
 the
 big
 business
 problem
 they're


trying
 to
 solve,
 right?
 How
 do
 we
 help


them
 get
 to
 business
 value
 faster?
 How


do
 we
 reduce
 the
 let's
 say
 the
 compute


cost
 to
 drive
 that
 business
 decision
 and


then
 ultimately
 help
 them
 help
 them
 take


it
 to
 production?


Kevin,
 can
 you
 speak
 a
 little
 bit
 to
 uh


about
 compute
 at
 the
 edge
 and
 edge


networking
 and
 kind
 of
 how
 this


partnership
 might
 play
 a
 role
 in
 that
 as


well?


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 going
 to
 be


critical.
 I
 like
 I've
 thought
 a
 lot


about,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 go
 back
 15
 years


like
 when
 when
 the
 consumers
 had,
 you


know,


>> iPhone
 applications
 in
 their
 pocket
 and


then
 but
 but
 but
 maybe
 our
 operators


downra
 in
 a
 battlefield,
 you
 know,
 had


more
 of
 equivalent
 to
 a
 two-way
 radio,


right?
 and
 and
 and
 you
 know,
 so
 it's


like
 getting
 the
 technology
 that
 that


the
 best
 technology
 that
 we
 that
 anybody


in
 the
 US
 can
 have
 on
 the
 phone
 and
 and


using
 it
 for
 a
 mission
 purpose,
 you


know,
 out
 in
 the
 field
 is
 going
 to
 be


really
 important.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 that


does
 mean
 a
 lot
 of
 edge.
 I
 think
 it


means
 it
 means
 like
 like
 figuring
 out


how
 to
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 stuff
 on
 prem


inside
 of
 customer
 data
 centers,
 uh
 on


you
 know
 the
 AI
 factories,
 um
 the
 super


paws,
 some
 of
 the
 products
 you
 have.
 So


we're
 we're
 working
 through
 a
 lot
 of


that
 and
 I
 think
 I
 think
 we're
 we've


already
 seen
 a
 lot
 of
 customer
 demand.


um
 to
 really
 you
 know
 run
 our
 product


with
 Nvidia's
 product
 um
 and
 the
 various


different
 models
 that
 they
 can
 get
 you


know
 more
 or
 less
 inside
 their
 perimeter


and
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 that's
 a


consistent
 architecture
 with
 doing


something
 on
 the
 edge
 and
 I
 I
 I
 think


that's
 um
 I
 think
 that's
 actually
 going


to
 be
 a
 really
 big
 trend
 to
 use
 this


because
 you
 you
 know
 you
 you
 want
 to


control
 this
 technology
 and
 be
 in
 some


sense
 guaranteed
 that
 you
 have
 access
 to


it.


>> Yeah.
 Because
 sometimes
 for
 the
 cloud


you're
 not
 guaranteed.
 I
 mean,
 sometimes


it
 takes
 20
 seconds
 to
 get
 the
 data
 back


and
 that's
 life
 or
 death
 decisions.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 and
 if
 and
 if
 you're
 going


to
 have
 problems
 like
 that,
 like
 you
 you


kind
 of
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 control
 it


end
 to
 end,
 you
 know?
 So,
 it's
 like


maybe
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 perfect,
 but


like
 I
 I
 want
 to
 I
 actually
 want
 to
 own


this.
 I
 want
 to
 be
 responsible
 for
 it


end
 to
 end
 and
 we
 want
 to
 help
 our


customers
 do
 that.
 Um
 uh
 and
 and
 I
 think


that's
 really
 important.
 The
 um
 you


know,
 you
 you've
 asked
 a
 lot
 over
 over


over
 the
 the
 time
 that
 we've
 known
 each


other
 about
 about
 our
 boot
 camps
 and
 and


our
 joint
 go
 to
 market.


>> I
 got
 to
 speak
 at
 an
 NVIDIA
 boot
 camp


today.


>> Yeah.
 I
 want
 to
 throw
 this
 in
 because
 I


think
 we
 with
 about
 I
 don't
 know
 two
 or


three
 weeks
 of
 planning,
 it
 wasn't
 that


much.
 We
 had
 this
 event
 scheduled.
 We


were
 talking.
 We
 said,
 "Hey,
 maybe
 we


should
 do,
 you
 know,
 a
 boot
 camp
 with
 a


customer
 um
 day
 of
 our
 Paragon
 event."


And
 we
 said,
 "Okay,
 let's
 try
 it."
 And


and
 uh
 I
 think
 we
 had
 one
 in
 mind.
 We


ended
 up,
 I
 think,
 with
 seven
 total.
 And


and
 you
 know,
 seven
 is
 not
 a
 massive


number,
 but
 the
 variety,
 I
 think,
 was


really
 interesting.
 We
 had
 uh
 we
 had
 a


bank.
 Uh
 we
 had
 a
 few
 different
 sort
 of


like
 electronic
 device
 manufacturers.
 We


had
 a
 a
 a
 pharmaceutical
 company.
 We
 had


a
 a
 pharmaceutical
 manufacturer


pharmaceutical
 uh
 uh
 uh
 retail
 company.


Um
 I'm
 probably
 not
 naming
 them
 all,
 but


there
 was
 uh
 I
 don't know
 it
 was
 it
 was


it
 was
 really
 interesting,
 really
 fun.


>> But
 to
 your
 point,
 I
 think
 uh
 the
 power


of
 ontology
 connected
 to
 accelerating


computing
 crosses
 every
 industry.
 And
 so


to
 give
 another
 example
 at
 the
 edge
 uh


that
 that
 the
 Teton
 ranch
 Yes.
 is


starting
 to
 use
 uh
 let's
 say
 vision


analytics
 uh
 to
 watch
 the
 rodeo
 to
 help


both
 the
 judges
 and
 the
 broadcasters


tell
 a
 better
 story
 about
 you
 know
 about


uh
 rodeo
 uh
 which
 is
 a
 really
 awesome


use
 case
 that
 starts
 to
 cross
 into
 media


and
 entertainment
 um
 and
 so
 we're
 really


excited
 about
 that
 announcement
 here
 at


the
 show
 but
 this
 partnership
 is


multifaceted
 across
 so
 many
 different


industries
 the
 other
 industry
 that
 we


made
 an
 announcement
 about
 is
 this
 this


uh
 program
 we
 call
 chain
 reaction
 y
 and


that's
 because
 I
 think
 both
 companies


realize,
 you
 know,
 uh
 that
 we're
 at
 this


moment
 where
 we
 want
 to
 build
 this
 uh


this
 digital
 intelligence
 to
 power
 the


US
 economy.
 It's
 great
 for,
 you
 know,


the
 US
 to
 lead
 in
 this
 in
 this
 way.
 Uh


the
 US
 has
 such
 a
 huge
 demand
 for
 uh


this
 this
 artificial
 intelligence
 to


power
 a
 range
 of
 new
 business


applications.
 Um
 and
 so
 by
 working


together
 we
 can
 really
 start
 to
 build


these
 gigawatt
 data
 centers
 uh
 and
 and


look
 at
 the
 entire
 supply
 chain
 from


power
 generation
 to
 distribution
 to


construction
 to
 data
 center
 operations


to
 bring
 this
 infrastructure
 online


faster
 and
 more
 efficiently
 by
 the
 two


companies
 working
 together.
 So
 you
 know


this
 multiaceted
 partnership
 continues


to
 grow
 really
 across
 every
 industry.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 that
 was
 going
 to
 be
 my
 my


last
 question.
 Uh
 thank
 you
 again
 both


for
 taking
 the
 time
 to
 do
 this.
 uh
 chain


reaction
 uh
 we
 all
 got
 to
 see
 that


publicly
 announced
 today
 and
 it
 it it


blew
 me
 away
 because
 it
 it
 almost
 hit
 me


like
 a
 break
 like
 obviously
 the
 data


center
 buildout
 is
 growing


exponentially.
 Pounder
 has
 software
 that


has
 been
 instrumental
 towards
 many


different
 energy
 infrastructure


companies.
 PG&E
 is
 one
 of the
 ones
 that


comes
 to
 mind
 in
 terms
 of
 dealing
 with


wildfires.
 Kevin,
 can
 you
 speak
 to
 the


idea
 of
 this
 partnership
 continuing
 to


expand
 and
 why
 why
 you
 think
 Palanteer


software
 should
 be
 a
 deacto
 AI


infrastructure
 operating
 system
 for
 the


data
 center
 buildout?
 Yeah,
 I
 I
 think


the
 example
 that
 Kavanaaugh
 guy
 gave
 the


the
 gentleman
 from
 Kavanaaugh


construction
 gave
 now
 now
 that's
 you


know
 construction
 is
 a
 really
 important


aspect
 to
 this
 buildout
 but
 he
 wasn't


talking
 about
 necessarily
 like
 you
 know


foundry
 as
 his
 operating
 system
 or
 you


know
 using
 AI
 to
 better
 his
 operating


system
 he
 was
 talking
 about
 the


Kavanaaugh
 operating
 system


>> right
 now
 this
 is
 an
 operating
 system


that
 is
 yours
 and
 and
 I
 think that's
 a


that's
 a
 really
 big
 piece
 because
 while


we
 could
 deliver
 a
 lot
 out
 of
 the
 box


and
 we
 we
 could
 deliver
 a
 lot
 of


software
 sort
 of
 like
 that
 is
 consistent


with
 lots
 of
 different
 companies.
 That


that
 last
 bit,
 that
 last
 mile,
 the


forward
 deployed
 engineer,
 the
 the


unique
 ontology
 build
 like
 that
 is
 what


makes
 you
 these
 our
 customers
 and
 and


any
 company
 special
 and
 and
 and
 it's
 the


difference
 between
 winning
 and
 losing
 in


some
 cases.
 It's
 the
 difference
 between


your
 project
 being
 on
 time
 or
 not
 on


time.
 uh
 getting
 this
 infrastructure


stood
 up,
 you
 know,
 the
 these
 data


centers
 every
 day
 that
 the
 construction


project
 is
 late,
 you
 can
 measure
 in


profits
 and
 and
 and
 so
 um
 I
 think
 that


like
 in
 in in
 some
 sense
 like
 we
 want
 to


build
 the
 operating
 system
 that


>> is
 our
 customers


>> and
 and
 and
 you
 could
 do
 that
 with
 with


having
 a
 lot
 of
 technology
 that
 we
 have


in
 our
 stack,
 but
 but
 that
 last
 mile
 is


um
 well
 that
 that's
 sort
 of
 like
 that's


your
 weapon,
 right?


>> And
 and
 I
 think
 and
 I
 think
 that
 that's


what
 we
 want
 to
 deliver
 to
 all
 of
 our


customers.


Justin,
 Kevin,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 time.


This
 was
 absolutely
 awesome
 and
 congrats


on
 the
 partnership
 and
 we
 hope
 to
 see
 it


extend
 over
 the
 next
 decade.


>> All right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 the
 channel.
 We
 are
 here
 at
 Pounder's


end
 of
 year
 2025
 event,
 Paragon.
 I'm


here
 with
 a
 familiar
 guest.
 Haven't


spoke
 to
 him
 since
 June
 of
 2024.


>> No,
 it's
 been
 a
 minute.


>> It's
 been
 a
 minute,
 but
 we're
 back.
 We


both
 kind
 of
 grew
 our
 beards
 a
 little


bit.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.


>> Uh
 Bill
 Ward
 from
 North
 Slope.
 Bill,


thanks
 for
 being
 here.


>> Oh
 my
 gosh,
 thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> There's
 thousands
 of
 AWS
 firms,
 GCP


firms,
 Azure
 firms.
 there's
 not
 that


many
 Palunteer
 firms
 and
 you're
 one
 of


the
 first
 ones.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 big
 reasons


that
 that's
 true
 is
 that
 Palunteer
 is


not
 a
 consulting
 company.
 Uh
 and
 I
 mean


this
 was
 something
 that
 was
 very
 hard


for
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 to
 understand


back
 when
 I
 worked
 at
 Palanteer.
 This


conversation
 would
 come
 up
 all
 the
 time.


And
 I
 think
 one
 of the
 very
 cool
 things


that
 uh
 people
 are
 starting
 to


understand
 about
 Palunteer
 today
 is
 that


the
 way
 that
 you
 build
 quality
 software


is
 by
 forward
 deploying
 and
 building


against
 specific
 missions
 and
 figuring


out
 how
 you
 accelerate
 specific


outcomes.
 And
 that's
 what
 Foundry
 is,


right?
 It
 started
 as
 uh
 ways
 for
 us
 to


go
 win
 faster
 and
 it's
 become
 this


customer
 product
 that
 you
 can
 go
 win
 on


on
 your
 own,
 right?
 And
 one
 of
 the


things
 that's
 very
 exciting
 for
 us
 is
 we


also
 don't
 consider
 ourselves
 to
 be
 a


consulting
 company.
 We're
 a
 software


company
 that
 ships
 specific
 outcomes
 on


the
 Palunteer
 platform
 for
 our


customers.
 And
 Palanteer
 is
 an


enterprise
 operating
 system.
 We
 build


applications
 that
 are
 compounding
 the


value
 of
 that
 platform
 so
 that
 people


can
 get
 more
 work
 done.


>> It's
 almost
 like
 the
 FTE
 model
 that


Palenter
 introduced.
 you
 guys
 are
 the


manifestation
 of
 that
 in
 a
 new
 company.


>> Uh
 we
 we
 uh
 are
 very
 privileged
 to
 get


to
 do
 this
 work
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 it's
 hard


to
 compare
 yourself
 to
 Palunteer
 FTEEs,


but
 uh
 we're
 very
 honored
 to
 be
 doing


this
 work
 alongside
 them
 and
 I
 think


there's
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 hype
 around
 the


FTE
 model
 right
 now.


>> Yes.


>> And
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 you
 know
 we


feel
 very
 strongly
 and
 I
 think
 those
 of


us
 who
 worked
 at
 Palunteer
 at
 the
 North


Slope
 team
 uh
 feel
 very
 deeply
 is
 uh
 you


can't
 just
 slap
 a
 label
 on
 a
 thing.
 Yes.


uh
 it
 has
 much
 more
 to
 I
 mean
 all
 the


stories
 that
 we've
 been
 hearing
 here


tonight
 of
 going
 to
 ground
 with
 the


actual
 operators
 in
 a
 business
 trying
 to


solve
 the
 specific
 problem
 with
 them


like
 we
 are
 on
 their
 team
 like
 we
 own


that
 outcome
 ourselves
 Dr.
 Dr.
 Karp


often
 talks
 about
 us
 owning
 the
 value


creation
 risk
 right
 for
 our
 customers.


That's
 very
 much
 how
 we
 operate
 too.


>> Yeah.
 The
 burden
 of
 value
 creation
 I


think
 is
 one
 of the
 most
 interesting


things
 about
 Palenter.
 It's
 something
 I


personally
 have
 tried
 to
 apply
 in
 my


life.
 How
 can
 I
 give
 more
 to
 in
 my


business
 the
 audience
 uh
 than
 I
 take
 and


you
 have
 to
 accept
 the
 burden
 of
 value


creation.
 So
 a
 year
 ago
 you
 guys
 decided


uh
 that
 there's
 companies
 across
 the


world
 that
 should
 be
 implementing


pounder
 software
 but
 they
 don't
 know
 how


to
 and
 you
 guys
 wanted
 to
 take
 the


burden
 of
 actually
 showing
 how
 to
 do


this.
 Um
 since
 then
 what
 has
 changed


over
 the
 past
 year
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 rate


of
 growth
 you're
 seeing
 in
 more


companies
 that
 are
 at
 least


>> interested
 to
 have
 a
 conversation
 around


implementing
 Foundry
 in
 their


corporation?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 there's
 there's
 two
 things


that
 people
 are
 waking
 up
 to.
 First
 is


the
 true
 magic
 of
 Palunteer
 being
 that


you
 can
 solve
 specific
 problems
 which


you
 always
 get
 a
 better
 outcome
 for
 your


business
 when
 you're
 solving
 a
 specific


problem
 than
 you
 do
 when
 you
 try
 to


solve
 it
 generically.
 Right?
 Generic


solutions
 lead
 to
 commoditization.


You're
 doing
 the
 same
 workflow
 everybody


else
 is
 doing.
 And
 all
 the
 businesses


that
 are
 here,
 all
 the
 businesses
 that


we
 work
 with
 are
 trying
 to
 do
 something


category
 redefining,
 right?
 They're


trying
 to
 change
 how
 their
 business


operates,
 how
 their
 industry
 operates.


And
 you
 have
 to
 do
 that
 by
 doing


something
 special
 and
 different.
 And
 the


magic
 of
 Palunteer
 is
 you
 actually
 get


to
 go
 build
 the
 software
 to
 do
 that


special
 and
 different
 thing.
 Uh
 even
 if


you're
 not
 a
 technology
 company
 like


Palunteer.
 I
 mean
 at
 Palanteer
 we
 built


a
 lot
 of
 our
 own
 internal
 software.
 At


North
 Slope
 we're
 doing
 the
 same
 thing.


We're
 building
 it
 on
 AFTD
 which
 is
 you


know
 sort
 of
 the
 tip
 of
 the
 spear
 of


Palunteer's
 product
 line.
 And
 we
 believe


that
 that's
 the
 right
 way
 to
 build
 any


kind
 of
 business.
 But
 that's


traditionally
 been
 the
 preserve
 of
 an


enterprise
 technology
 company.
 But
 now


companies
 there
 was
 one
 company
 tonight


that's
 been
 around
 for
 140
 years.
 They


look
 more
 like
 a
 technology
 company
 than


many
 Silicon
 Valley
 startups
 because


they
 are
 building
 their
 entire


organization
 with
 specific
 solutions
 on


Palunteer.
 And
 that's
 that's
 a
 thing


that
 I
 think
 is
 a
 big
 change
 from
 a
 few


years
 ago
 where
 people
 didn't
 quite


understand
 how
 powerful
 that
 could
 be.


And
 now
 there
 is
 this
 community
 here.


And
 it's
 still
 a
 very
 small
 group,
 but


there's
 a
 small
 group
 of
 people
 who
 are


going to
 go
 lead
 the
 next
 century
 who


are
 here
 who
 have
 figured
 that
 out.


>> Is
 the
 rise
 of
 AI
 prompting
 more
 inbound


for
 you
 guys?
 because
 uh
 just
 hooking
 up


chatgbt
 to
 an
 enterprise
 is
 not
 a
 way
 to


actually
 implement
 AI.


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 it
 very
 much
 is
 and
 I
 I


mean
 Palunteer
 is
 creating
 this
 market


right
 uh
 by
 offering
 this
 solution
 but
 I


think
 the
 biggest
 change
 that
 we've
 seen


is
 people
 have
 tried
 the
 chat
 GPT


experiment
 they
 have
 seen
 that
 doing
 a


bunch
 of
 those
 uh
 in
 isolated
 silos


doesn't
 really
 work.
 It's
 hard
 to


oneshot
 a
 solution
 to
 a
 problem.
 But
 if


you're
 operating
 on
 the
 Palunteer


platform,
 you
 actually
 can
 build
 a


compounding
 application
 layer
 on
 top
 of


the
 operating
 system
 where
 every
 time


you
 solve
 a
 new
 problem,
 it's
 actually


making
 your
 previous
 solutions
 to
 the


old
 problems
 better,
 faster.
 Uh,
 and
 the


agents
 that
 you
 have
 running
 around
 your


business
 operating
 alongside
 your
 people


are
 actually
 getting
 smarter
 and
 more


effective
 over
 time
 as
 well.
 these


agents
 that
 enterprises
 are
 starting
 to


get
 more
 excited
 about.
 I
 mean,
 Tampa


General
 and
 R1
 seeing
 how
 like
 something


like
 uh
 denial
 prevention
 rates,
 the


ability
 to
 have
 uh
 agentic
 workflows


where
 the
 data
 is
 immediately
 consumed


and
 then
 the
 increase
 of
 the
 time
 for


payout
 is
 up
 200%.


>> Yep.


>> When
 you're
 talking
 to
 these
 customers


that
 want
 to
 start
 implementing
 agents


or
 at least
 the
 concept
 of
 agents,
 how


important
 is
 the
 uh
 education
 of
 an


ontology
 to
 these
 clients?
 M
 well
 I
 mean


one
 of the
 things
 that
 is
 exciting
 to
 us


is
 so
 many
 folks
 are
 excited
 about
 what


Palenter
 is
 able
 to
 provide
 to
 their


business
 that
 they're
 kind
 of
 there
 for


the
 ontology
 right
 this
 makes
 intuitive


sense
 if
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it
 from


first
 principles
 if
 you're
 not
 just


trying
 to
 procure
 a
 piece
 of
 software


but
 you're
 actually
 trying
 to
 change
 how


your
 business
 functions


>> it's
 sort
 of
 obvious
 that
 you
 have
 all


these
 different
 disparate
 data
 sets
 and


you
 need
 to
 get
 them
 into
 like
 one
 set


of
 nouns
 and
 verbs
 for
 your
 business


right


>> and
 what's
 really
 really
 exciting
 is


folks
 also
 have
 started
 to
 understand


that
 uh
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 machines


working
 alongside
 your
 people
 uh
 in
 the


form
 of
 LLMs,
 they
 need
 a
 language
 that


they
 can
 understand
 that
 humans
 can
 also


understand.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 ontology
 is


this
 incredibly
 uh
 powerful
 flywheel
 for


that.
 Uh
 and
 so
 for
 most
 of
 our


customers
 actually,
 they
 get
 it
 right


and
 what
 we
 get
 to
 talk
 about
 with
 them


is
 what
 is
 your
 hardest
 problem?
 How
 do


we
 get
 into
 the
 weeds
 of
 this?
 What
 data


do
 you
 have?
 Let's
 go
 get
 going.
 Let's


build
 you
 something,
 you
 know,
 in
 the


next
 week
 and
 ship
 it
 in
 the
 next
 day


and
 ship
 it.
 Uh
 so
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 that.
 The
 the
 thing
 that
 is
 uh
 very


cool
 to
 see
 though
 is
 oftentimes
 it's


like
 one
 person
 or
 a
 couple
 of
 people
 in


an
 organization
 who
 are
 really
 tip
 of


the
 spear
 on
 those
 efforts
 and
 are


leading
 the
 charge
 and
 evangelizing


inside
 their
 own
 organizations.
 And
 what


is
 really
 cool
 about
 the
 way
 the


Palenterer
 operates
 and
 that
 we
 try
 to


operate
 as
 well
 is
 it's
 all
 show
 don't


tell.
 We
 just
 go
 solve
 the
 problem


demonstrate
 that
 we
 have
 and
 then
 all
 of


a
 sudden
 everyone
 else
 in
 the


organization
 gets
 excited
 about
 it
 too.


It's
 really
 really
 cool
 to
 see.
 So
 I
 I


think
 that
 leads
 into
 the
 next
 question


of
 uh
 this
 concept
 of
 value
 creation.


You
 wouldn't
 classify
 yourself
 as
 a
 pure


consulting
 firm
 uh
 more
 of
 a
 software


company.
 How
 do
 you
 define
 the
 way
 you


guys
 get
 paid?
 Is
 it
 for
 the
 education?


Is
 it
 for
 the
 implementation
 of
 the


software?
 Is
 it
 for
 the
 ideation?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Uh
 it
 it
 is
 for


building
 software
 that
 that's
 what
 we


do.
 So
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 the
 the
 core
 of


being
 a
 Ford
 deployed
 engineer
 at


Palunteer,
 at
 North
 Slope
 or
 anywhere


else
 uh
 there
 are
 very
 few
 places
 but


anywhere
 else
 that
 does
 it
 in
 the
 in
 the


way
 that
 we
 think
 about
 it.
 You
 have
 a


problem
 and
 you
 have
 data.


>> Yes.


>> And
 then
 the
 job
 of
 the
 forward
 deployed


engineer
 is
 to
 solve
 that
 problem
 with


that
 data
 by
 shipping
 software.
 Yeah.


And
 that's
 what
 we
 do.
 And
 what's
 really


cool
 about
 Palenteer
 is
 they
 figured
 out


a
 way
 to
 make
 that
 so
 incredibly


powerfully
 fast
 and
 production
 scale


secure
 and
 able
 to
 be
 federated
 out


across
 a
 very
 complex
 organization.
 And


that's
 why
 it's
 a
 joy
 to
 build
 on
 this


platform.
 But
 what
 we
 do
 every
 time
 we


show
 up
 with
 a
 customer
 is
 we
 start
 with


the
 data.
 We
 start
 with
 the
 problem
 and


we
 are
 there
 writing
 code
 and
 shipping


software.
 Um,
 we're
 doing
 it
 all
 in


Palunteer.
 We
 can
 do
 it
 way
 faster
 than


we
 could
 if
 we
 were
 uh
 not
 able
 to


leverage
 the
 product
 leverage
 of
 the


platform.


>> AIF
 FTEE,
 this
 is
 something
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 curious
 about.
 It's
 a,
 you


know,
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 Unkid
 who
 I
 think


is
 the
 lead
 on
 this
 uh
 8
 months
 ago
 and


you
 know,
 it
 was
 really
 cool
 5
 months


later.
 It's
 like
 in
 customers
 hands.
 You


guys
 now
 are
 saying,
 "Hey,
 we're
 going


to
 take
 this
 and
 take
 it
 to
 the
 next


level."
 How
 is
 that
 process
 been


implementing
 it
 for
 customers?
 Yeah,
 I


mean
 I
 think
 that
 one
 one
 of
 the
 really


exciting
 things
 working
 in
 the
 palentry


ecosystem
 is
 there
 is
 so
 much
 product


development.
 There's
 so
 much
 that
 gets


shipped.
 Um
 and
 what's
 fun
 for
 us
 is
 we


get
 to
 be
 the
 tip
 of
 the
 spear
 of
 that.


The
 reason
 that's
 true
 is
 partly
 because


we
 run
 our
 business
 on
 Palunteer,
 right?


>> Uh
 and
 so
 we
 are
 using
 the
 software


every
 day
 for
 our
 own
 work
 uh
 and
 to


make
 sure
 that
 we
 are
 running
 uh
 as
 like


our
 own
 version
 of
 a
 category
 redefining


company.
 You
 know,
 we
 think
 the
 future


of
 services
 is
 software,
 right?
 And
 to


do
 that
 we
 have
 to
 build
 ourselves
 our


own
 software
 internally
 and
 aft
 makes
 us


so
 much
 faster
 at
 doing
 that.
 One
 of
 the


cool
 things
 for
 customers
 I
 think
 is


also
 uh
 figuring
 out
 how
 to
 be
 engineers


in
 this
 new
 era.
 Palunteer
 provides
 this


incredible
 really
 wide
 range
 of
 tools


that
 allow
 you
 to
 do
 engineering
 work


from
 a
 variety
 of
 different
 backgrounds.


If
 you
 want
 to
 be
 completely
 code
 first


which
 many
 of
 the
 folks
 at
 NorthSlope


are
 uh
 we
 have
 so
 many
 tools
 that
 we
 can


use
 in
 the
 Palunteer
 platform
 that
 allow


us
 to
 do
 that.
 AIFT
 opens
 up
 a
 whole
 new


frontier
 both
 for
 those
 of
 us
 who
 write


a
 lot
 of
 code
 and
 also
 for
 those
 who


don't.
 Um,
 and
 you
 can
 ship
 things
 so


much
 faster.


>> So,
 so,
 so
 an
 example
 of
 AID
 for
 a


customer
 would
 be
 a
 someone
 who
 doesn't


code,
 a
 natural
 language
 prompt
 that


requires
 a
 lot
 of
 backend
 coding
 that


traditionally
 an
 FTE
 would
 code
 up.
 Now,


the
 AI
 is
 doing
 it.


>> I
 I
 would
 imagine
 it
 as,
 you
 know,
 you


and
 I
 are
 working
 on
 a
 problem
 together


and
 I'm
 an
 FTE
 and
 you're
 at
 a
 customer


trying
 to
 solve
 a
 problem.
 uh
 you
 know


to
 a
 large
 degree
 you
 still
 need
 uh
 a


north
 slope
 person
 or
 a
 palunteer
 person


around
 the
 hoop
 but
 uh
 there
 are
 a
 lot


of
 problems
 and
 really
 exciting
 future


for
 aft
 where
 like
 we
 can
 solve
 that


problem
 together
 with
 the
 help
 of


foundry
 acting
 as
 an
 agent
 on
 its
 own


and
 we're
 really
 excited
 about
 that


future
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 where
 you
 know
 we
 as


north
 slope
 are
 trying
 to
 build
 our


software
 direction
 uh
 is
 on
 how
 do
 we


harness
 the
 power
 of
 that
 and
 build


specific
 workflows
 for
 customers
 really


really
 quickly
 and
 uh
 at
 very
 very
 high


scale
 and
 so
 aft
 is
 this
 incredible


jumping
 off
 point
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 that


moving.


>> Are
 the
 customers
 open
 to
 trying
 these


brand
 new
 things
 or
 are
 they
 a
 bit
 more


hesitant?


>> Yeah,
 absolutely.
 Um
 and
 I
 you
 know
 it


varies
 from
 organization
 to


organization,
 but
 I
 think
 that
 most


folks
 who
 we
 work
 with,
 they're
 they're


all
 in.
 And
 that's
 the
 other
 that's
 a


second
 thing
 that's
 really
 changed
 in


the
 last
 year
 is
 folks
 are
 starting
 to


understand
 that
 if
 you
 want
 to
 transform


how
 your
 organization
 operates,
 you
 kind


of
 have
 to
 do
 it
 full
 scale.
 Yeah.
 And


you
 want
 to
 operate
 like
 an
 enterprise


technology
 company
 that
 means
 the
 whole


company
 needs
 to
 operate
 on
 AI.
 Yeah.


And
 a
 FTE
 is
 this
 incredible
 mechanism


for
 getting
 many
 many
 of
 those
 products


into
 production
 much
 much
 faster.


>> What
 uh
 industries
 were
 is
 North
 Slope


not
 only
 targeting
 but
 are
 you
 seeing


kind
 of
 more
 broad-based
 success
 in?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean
 it's
 it's
 very


palenteer.
 I
 mean
 everybody
 has


problems.
 Anyone
 who's
 trying
 to
 do


something
 that
 is
 unique
 and
 specific
 in


the
 world
 has
 a
 problem.
 It's
 an


unsolved
 problem
 by
 definition.


generic
 software


for
 customers
 across
 a
 huge
 variety
 of


industries.
 Many
 of
 our
 customers
 are


here,
 really
 exciting.
 Um,
 but
 I'd
 say


that,
 you
 know,
 some
 of
 the
 things
 we're


very
 proud
 of
 is
 we're
 helping
 uh


healthcare
 institutions
 make
 sure
 that


doctors
 are
 able
 to
 provide
 one
 much


higher
 quality
 care
 for
 their
 patients


by
 having
 more
 data
 around
 the
 quality


they're
 providing
 and
 spend
 a
 lot
 less


time
 on
 the
 paperwork
 around
 that


quality.
 Uh
 we're
 also
 really
 proud
 that


we're
 helping
 many
 different
 energy


companies
 ship
 more
 energy
 onto
 the


worldwide
 grid,
 especially
 clean
 energy,


which
 has
 been
 very
 very
 cool,


>> which
 in
 the
 world
 of
 data
 centers
 is


pretty
 important.


>> Exactly.
 Especially
 in
 the
 the
 era
 we're


entering
 right
 now.
 Um
 we
 work
 with


investment
 management
 firms,
 work
 with


aviation
 companies,
 uh
 we
 work
 with


consumer
 services
 companies,
 uh


veterinary
 hospitals,
 things
 like
 that.


How
 are
 these
 guys
 finding
 you?


>> Huge,
 huge
 swath.
 Uh
 well,
 people
 come


to
 us
 because
 they
 love
 working
 with


Palunteer
 and
 they
 want
 more,
 right?
 Uh,


and
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 really
 exciting


things
 for
 us
 is
 it
 it
 isn't
 I
 mean


there's
 so
 much
 work
 to
 do
 in
 this


space.
 There's
 so
 much
 momentum
 in
 the


Palunteer
 ecosystem
 that
 folks
 are
 just


trying
 to
 move
 even
 faster.
 Uh,
 and


we're
 there
 to
 be
 that
 extra
 capacity.


So,
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 fully
 dedicated


internal
 team
 or
 your
 team
 and
 the


Palunteer
 team
 you're
 working
 with
 are


already
 tied
 up
 building,
 you
 know,
 use


cases
 1
 through
 10,
 but
 you
 want
 to
 do


20,
 uh,
 that's
 usually
 when
 we
 get
 a


call.
 Do
 you
 think
 there
 will
 be
 over


the
 next
 decade
 thousands
 of
 these


Palunteer
 derivative
 companies
 that
 are


implementing
 it
 because
 is
 that's
 what


exists
 for
 AWS
 and
 Google?


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 my
 my
 honest
 answer
 I'm
 I'm
 biased,


right?
 Uh
 but
 my
 honest
 answer
 is
 I


don't
 think
 so.
 I
 think
 there
 will
 be
 a


small
 number
 of
 very
 good
 ones.
 Uh
 and


we
 very
 much
 aspire
 to
 be
 one
 of
 those


very
 good
 ones.
 Uh
 the
 reason
 I
 think


that's
 true
 there's
 the
 same
 reason
 why


a
 lot
 of
 Palunteer
 customers
 are
 uh


themselves
 so
 unique
 like
 they
 are


trying
 to
 build
 uh
 a
 an
 N
 of
 one
 company


like
 that's
 why
 you
 work
 with
 Palunteer


that's
 why
 we
 work
 with
 Palunteer
 we


think
 that
 the
 traditional
 way
 of
 doing


enterprise
 technology
 is
 wrong
 uh
 in


most
 of
 corporate
 America
 and
 around
 the


world
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 customers
 we
 work


with
 think
 that
 in
 their
 industry


everyone
 else
 is
 getting
 it
 wrong
 and


they
 want
 to
 build
 a
 compounding


advantage
 that
 no
 one
 else
 can
 catch
 up


to
 and
 I
 think
 that
 the
 the
 secret
 sauce


for
 us
 is
 forward
 deployed
 engineering


on
 the
 Palunteer
 platform
 means
 that
 we


can
 be
 a
 software
 company.
 We
 can
 ship


software
 as
 our
 output
 to
 our
 customers


rather
 than
 having
 uh
 you
 know
 as
 as
 Dr.


Karp
 describes
 it
 like
 a
 parasitic


relationship
 with
 them.
 Uh
 and
 that's


actually
 a
 very
 hard
 motion
 for
 a
 lot
 of


traditional
 players
 to
 do.
 It's
 also


very
 hard
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 know
 uh


single
 industry
 or
 single
 workflow
 SAS


software
 companies
 to
 do
 as
 well.
 Uh
 and


so
 I
 am
 very
 confident
 there
 are
 going


to
 be
 others
 like
 us.
 We
 have
 a
 lot
 of


friends
 who
 are
 working
 in
 this
 space
 uh


who
 are
 sort
 of
 our
 friendly
 peers.


There's
 so
 much
 work
 to
 do.
 Um
 but
 I
 do


think
 it's
 a
 relatively
 small
 community


and
 and
 the
 world
 is
 changing
 to
 a
 place


where
 if
 if
 you
 start
 now
 uh
 especially


if
 you're
 a
 customer
 who's
 here
 today,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 really
 hard
 to
 catch


you
 because
 you've
 got,
 you
 know,
 a
 two


three
 fouryear
 head
 start
 on
 Palunteer.


I
 mean,
 it's
 really
 difficult
 to
 go
 zero


to
 one
 at
 the
 pace
 that
 you're
 going to


be
 able
 to
 be
 accelerating
 away
 from


everyone
 else.


>> Let
 me
 throw
 this
 last
 question
 at
 you,


Bill,
 and
 thank
 you
 again
 for
 taking
 the


time
 to
 do
 this.
 Thank
 you.


>> Um,
 lot
 of
 conversations
 right
 now
 about


if
 AI
 is
 a
 bubble
 or
 if
 AI
 is
 hyped
 up


and
 you
 are
 implementing
 on
 the
 ground


floor
 AI
 at
 these
 companies
 every
 single


day
 for
 your
 customers.
 How
 are
 you


thinking
 of
 the
 concept
 of
 efficiency,


margins,
 productivity,
 saving
 cost
 like


is
 all
 this
 fake
 or
 is
 there
 something


real
 happening
 in
 enterprise
 software?


>> Yeah,
 there
 is
 something
 real
 happening


and
 also
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 hype.
 Uh
 and
 I


think
 one
 of the
 things
 that's
 unique


about
 the
 space
 that
 we
 get
 to
 occupy


all
 the
 folks
 who
 are
 in
 this
 room
 uh
 is


there's
 a
 sifting
 that's
 happening
 where


folks
 are
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 do
 I


actually
 get
 the
 value
 out
 of
 this
 and


what's
 cool
 about
 Palunteer
 is
 the
 AI
 is


a
 mechanism
 right
 uh
 I
 think
 there's


there's
 this
 metabolization
 of
 LLM
 into


the
 ontology
 as
 like
 a
 way
 to
 get
 work


done
 which
 is
 incredibly
 powerful
 but
 it


is
 the
 ontology
 itself
 that
 enables
 that


correct


>> and
 so
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 hype


uh
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 go
 take
 over
 the


world.
 I
 actually
 think
 it
 will,
 but
 it


requires
 doing
 it
 in
 like
 a
 production


enterprise
 way,
 right?


>> And
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 think
 a
 lot


of
 uh
 there,
 you
 know,
 there's
 these
 LLM


rapper
 companies
 and,
 you
 know,
 software


companies
 going
 after
 a
 single
 vertical.


I
 think
 one
 of the
 things
 that
 Palunteer


gets
 really
 right
 is
 it's
 still
 always


about
 the
 specific
 problem
 that
 the


company
 has
 that
 you're
 trying
 to
 solve.


It's
 about
 the
 specific
 user
 who
 needs


to
 be
 uh
 owning
 that
 outcome
 whether


they
 are
 doing
 a
 workflow
 themselves
 or


they're
 trusting
 an
 agent
 to
 do
 it


>> which
 creates
 a
 real
 use
 case.


>> Exactly.
 Exactly.
 And
 it's
 really
 really


hard
 for
 anyone
 other
 than
 Palunteer
 to


go
 compete
 on
 that
 because
 the
 amount
 of


complex
 technology
 it
 takes
 to
 enable


that
 is
 20
 years
 in
 the
 making.


>> Correct.
 Right.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 love
 it.
 Bill
 Ward,
 thank
 you
 for


being
 here
 for
 me.


>> If
 anyone
 sees
 this
 and
 wants
 to
 get


some
 pounder
 uh
 education
 from
 you,
 how


can
 they
 reach
 out?
 uh
 reach
 out
 to
 us


at
 northslope.com
 or
 hell@northslope.com


is
 our
 email
 address.
 Uh
 and
 we
 would


love
 to
 talk
 to
 you.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 the
 board.
 Appreciate
 it.


>> Take
 care.


>> All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 the
 channel.
 We
 are
 here
 at
 Paler's


end
 of
 year
 event
 Paragon
 and
 I'm
 here


with
 Sid
 and
 Jeffrey
 from
 Crisis
 24.


Thank
 you
 guys
 for
 being
 here.


>> Thank
 you
 very
 much.


>> Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 So
 your
 partnership


with
 Paler
 actually
 happened
 about
 3


years
 ago.
 Uh
 I
 started
 making
 content


around
 the
 company
 back
 in
 basically


2021
 2022
 when
 the
 partnership
 was


announced
 and
 it
 was
 one
 of
 the
 more


interesting
 partnerships
 that
 came
 out


during
 that
 time.
 No
 one
 really
 cared


about
 Palanteer.
 No
 one
 knew
 about


Palanteer.
 So
 every
 press
 release
 would


be
 like
 immediately
 dissected.
 So
 I
 just


want
 to
 give
 you
 the
 floor
 real
 quick.


Uh
 you
 can
 introduce
 yourself
 what
 you


do
 at
 Crisis
 24
 and
 what
 is
 Crisis
 2024


or
 24.


>> Sure.
 Well
 thanks
 for
 having
 us.
 We


really
 appreciate
 it.
 Crisis
 24
 is
 uh
 a


company
 really
 premised
 on
 how
 do
 we


allow
 the
 most
 uh
 distinguished


organizations
 and
 individuals
 that


operate?
 How
 do
 we
 allow
 them
 to
 do
 what


they
 do
 anywhere
 in
 the
 world
 with


confidence
 without
 having
 to
 worry
 about


things
 that
 in
 today's
 increasingly


uncertain
 world
 they
 may
 have
 to,
 right?


Their
 physical
 security,
 their
 health


security,
 their
 cyber
 security,
 all


those
 sorts
 of
 things.
 As
 Crisis
 24,
 we


bring
 solutions
 for
 to
 allow
 our
 clients


to
 do
 what
 they
 do
 best,
 which
 is
 their


business,
 right?
 Or
 their
 family.
 And


that's
 where
 I
 think
 it's
 been
 really


interesting
 to
 see
 uh
 where
 the
 company


has
 been
 and
 where
 it's
 going
 because
 we


really
 look
 at
 ourselves
 as
 being


instrumental
 to
 that
 fabric
 of
 where
 uh


companies
 and
 individuals
 are
 going


these
 days.


>> Right.
 Jeffrey.


>> Great.
 Yeah.
 Um
 so
 my
 role
 is
 I
 uh
 lead


ya
 uh
 which
 is
 the
 part
 of
 crisis
 24
 uh


that
 is
 actually
 a
 partnership
 with


palunteer
 right


>> um
 and
 so
 a
 is
 really
 focused
 on
 uh
 how


do
 we
 use
 AI
 and
 AI
 tools
 uh
 to
 bring


enterprise
 solutions
 uh
 to
 the
 market.


Our
 first
 product
 uh
 the
 presidential


brief
 uh
 modeled
 after
 the
 intelligence


report
 that
 the
 president
 of
 the
 United


States
 gets
 uh
 every
 day
 uh
 looks
 at
 and


uh
 uh
 takes
 all
 the
 data
 points
 of
 all


the
 geopolitical
 and
 geoeconomical
 uh


issues
 uh
 that
 exist
 around
 the
 world
 uh


and
 look
 to
 do
 a
 prioritization
 that


understands
 why
 something
 should
 be


important
 to
 a
 key
 executive.
 uh
 but
 not


just
 uh
 a
 prioritization
 but
 an
 impact


uh
 assessment
 using
 standard
 analytical


techniques
 uh
 developed
 in
 the


tradecraft
 of
 the
 intelligence
 community


uh
 to
 help
 the
 decision
 maker
 uh
 move


from
 reactive
 decisioning
 to
 proactive


decisioning.


>> Yeah.
 And
 the
 reason
 I
 thought
 this
 was


so
 interesting
 uh
 even
 3
 years
 ago
 was


because
 Palier
 is
 all
 about
 datadriven


decision-m
 right?
 How
 do
 you
 gather


insights
 from
 the
 data
 and
 then


effectively
 make
 the
 decision
 at
 scale?


So
 I
 guess
 we'll
 get
 started
 with
 this


question.
 um
 executives
 that
 get
 this


presidential
 brief
 I
 think
 is
 a
 very


interesting
 concept
 and
 you
 guys
 call
 it


this
 IO
 report.
 What
 exactly
 does


Pounder's
 role
 I
 guess
 through
 Foundry


or
 the
 ontology
 play
 with
 making
 this


thing
 real
 for
 executives?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 it's
 a
 great
 question
 and


Jeffrey
 will
 expand
 upon
 this,
 but
 I


think
 the
 key
 is
 uh
 leveraging
 the
 the


Foundry
 platform
 where
 literally


billions
 of
 pieces
 of
 information
 are


coming
 together
 and
 they're
 being


ingested,
 they're
 being
 structured,
 and


they're
 being
 analyzed
 and
 that
 is
 the


foundation
 and
 what
 we
 do
 with
 uh
 a


crisis
 24
 is
 we
 bring
 intelligence


tradecraftraft
 and
 security


tradecraftraft
 to
 that.
 So
 with


proprietary
 intelligence
 frameworks
 um


and
 and
 security
 uh
 uh
 kind
 of
 apparatus


we're
 able
 to
 take
 that
 information
 and


put
 it
 in
 a
 structure
 which
 the


intelligence
 community
 normally
 would


analyze
 and
 structure
 information
 such


that
 it
 becomes
 not
 just
 um
 interesting


information
 but
 it
 becomes
 uh


reactionary
 information
 that
 you
 can


look
 at
 and
 then
 be
 able
 to
 decipher
 not


just
 key
 insights
 but
 key
 actionable


decisions
 to
 be
 taken.
 And
 so
 this
 would


be
 like
 a
 CEO
 getting
 an
 update
 on
 their


supply
 chain
 and
 immediately
 realizing


something
 needs
 to
 be
 done
 if


something's
 not
 going
 well.


>> Correct.
 Absolutely.


>> Yes.
 And
 um


>> put
 the
 mic
 a
 little
 bit
 closer.


>> Oh,
 of
 course.
 Yeah.
 So,
 um
 the
 uh
 the


key
 is
 is
 being
 able
 to
 have
 all
 of
 the


different
 uh
 bits
 of
 information


combined
 and
 and
 we
 do
 that
 through


ingesting
 uh
 all
 kinds
 of
 different
 data


points.
 Everything
 from
 weather
 uh


political
 unrest
 um
 to
 uh
 you
 know


economic
 reports,


>> right?
 Um
 and
 and
 and
 we
 wouldn't
 be


able
 to
 do
 that
 all
 in
 real
 time
 uh
 if


it
 wasn't
 for
 both
 uh
 the
 foundry
 and


AIP
 platforms.
 Um
 and
 uh
 the
 ability
 for


uh
 something
 that
 would
 have
 happened
 to


take
 weeks
 uh
 or
 uh
 you
 know
 to
 to


analyze
 and
 understand
 the
 impact
 uh
 now


happens
 in
 real
 time.
 uh
 which
 is
 a


really
 interesting
 opportunity
 because


if
 you
 think
 about
 uh
 what's
 happened
 in


enterprise
 software
 for
 the
 last
 20


years
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 has
 been
 focused
 on
 uh


the
 business
 operations
 uh
 understanding


you
 know
 everything
 from
 accounting
 to


payroll
 to
 ERP
 systems
 uh
 sales
 uh


systems
 uh
 de
 development
 systems
 really


focuses
 on
 increasing
 the
 level
 of


fidelity
 that
 an
 executive
 can
 know


about
 their
 business
 and
 IA
 really
 uh
 uh


aims
 to
 reshape
 uh
 what
 we
 can
 think


about
 is
 the
 world
 external
 to
 a


business
 and
 making
 uh
 structured


understanding
 of
 everything
 from
 supply


chain
 uh
 to
 a
 trader
 uh
 insurance


healthcare
 uh
 finding
 those
 use
 cases
 uh


as
 we
 start
 to
 apply
 uh
 all
 of
 the
 work


that
 we've
 done
 to
 launch
 TPB
 uh
 or
 the


presidential
 uh
 brief
 uh
 will
 be
 reused


as
 we
 launch
 new
 products
 around
 new
 use


cases
 uh
 leveraging
 that
 same
 concept
 of


creating
 structure
 out
 of
 the
 noise
 uh


that
 exists
 AC
 with
 all
 of
 the
 global


data
 uh
 that
 is
 available
 to
 us
 on
 the


uh
 Foundry
 platform.


>> And
 I
 would
 maybe
 add
 um
 to
 that
 it's


it's
 really
 giving
 um
 those
 the


executive
 suite
 comfort
 and
 confidence.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 in
 the
 ability
 to
 take
 decisions


because
 not
 only
 are
 they
 uh
 coming
 from


an
 AIdriven
 uh
 mechanism
 and
 coming
 from


something
 as
 trusted
 as
 the
 the


Palunteer
 Foundry
 platform,
 but
 they
 are


referencable.
 You
 can
 you
 can
 see
 where


information
 comes.
 It's
 it's


attributable
 to
 specific
 sources.
 So


it's
 not
 just
 finger
 in
 the
 winding
 it


and
 a
 black
 box,
 but
 it's
 actually


attributable
 and
 uh
 analyzable.
 I
 would


give
 a
 a
 story
 maybe
 or
 a
 case
 in
 point.


Uh
 I
 think
 one
 interesting
 way
 of


understanding
 what
 the
 capability
 is
 um


is
 just
 think
 of
 a
 a
 global


manufacturing
 company.
 They're
 in
 a


situation
 where
 they're
 sourcing


materials
 from
 different
 parts
 in
 the


world
 and
 there
 might
 be
 a
 rare
 earth


set
 of
 materials
 that
 they
 source
 from


only
 a
 certain
 place
 in
 the
 world.
 And


rare
 earths
 have
 become
 very
 rare
 the


past
 couple
 of
 years.


>> And
 put
 a
 situation
 for
 instance
 uh
 you


know
 before
 the
 the
 invasion
 of
 Ukraine


happened.
 A
 lot
 of
 rare
 earths
 are
 found


in
 Ukraine


>> and
 there
 are
 manufacturing
 companies


that
 were
 sourcing
 there.
 Just
 think
 if


there
 was
 the
 intelligence
 to
 take
 uh


security
 intelligence
 information
 on


troop
 formations
 where
 where
 uh
 troops


were
 massing,
 where
 they
 were
 training,


weather
 information
 otherwise
 where


there
 was
 a
 ability
 to
 really
 maybe
 even


uh
 forecast
 a
 a
 risk
 probability
 of
 an


invasion
 in
 Ukraine
 by
 Russia.
 Supply


chains
 could
 have
 been
 adjusted
 in


advance
 to
 prevent
 disruptions,
 right?


And
 um
 this
 is
 where
 the
 offering
 with


pounder
 is
 really
 unique
 because
 with


the
 IA
 platform
 the
 AI
 intelligence


comes
 every
 morning
 to
 the
 intellig
 to


the
 uh
 seauite
 where
 they
 can
 be
 able
 to


look
 at
 that
 and
 really
 have
 key


decisions
 and
 option
 sets
 presented
 in


front
 of
 them.


>> And
 this
 intelligence
 is
 coming
 from
 all


the
 data
 inside
 the
 company.


>> It's
 it's
 proprietary
 but
 it's
 also


pulling
 from
 40,000
 open
 source
 data


sources
 around
 the
 world.
 So
 it's
 coming


from
 multiple
 language
 sources
 and
 it's


all
 translatable
 but
 all
 referenceable.


But
 then
 just
 taking
 that
 information


and
 then
 there
 uh
 AI
 generated
 um


intelligence
 uh
 option
 options
 that
 are


presented
 and
 what
 the
 the
 user
 can
 do


is
 leverage
 that
 with
 their
 own
 internal


intelligence
 teams.
 Correct.
 But
 they


can
 also
 then
 leverage
 it
 to
 call
 in
 and


crisis
 24
 has
 230
 uh
 intelligence


analysts
 on
 staff
 that
 cover
 every


country
 in
 the
 world
 across
 multiple


vectors.
 So
 being
 able
 to
 say,
 "Oh
 my


gosh,
 I
 see
 a
 potential
 disruption


happening
 in
 Ukraine.
 call
 crisis
 24,


can
 I
 get
 the
 Ukraine
 desk?
 You
 get
 the


lead
 of
 the
 Ukraine
 desk
 and
 you
 talk
 to


that
 person
 who's
 a
 specialist
 in
 that


country.
 And
 then
 even
 beyond
 that,
 we


have
 assets
 in
 situ
 in
 Ukraine
 and
 other


parts
 around
 the
 world.
 So
 you
 can
 even


take
 it
 one
 step
 further
 and
 get
 that


proprietary
 intelligence
 to
 feed
 a


business
 decision.
 Right.
 So
 it's
 it's


really
 seeing
 around
 corners
 and
 being


able
 to
 take
 threats
 and
 turn
 them
 into


opportunities
 for
 a
 business.
 And
 you


guys
 would
 classify
 yourself
 as
 a
 SAS


company
 that
 essentially
 uh
 provides


this
 offering
 and
 the
 reason
 customers


pay
 you
 guys
 is
 because
 the
 intelligence


via
 the
 ontology
 to
 even
 understand
 and


contextualize
 the
 necessity
 to
 call


someone
 in
 Ukraine
 is
 where
 the
 value


kind
 of
 lies.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 it's


important
 to
 understand
 that
 um
 whether


it's
 SAS
 or
 AI,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 I
 I


think
 the
 the
 key
 piece
 is
 is
 that
 it's


not
 just
 the
 technology
 and
 I
 think
 Sid


was
 alluded
 alluding
 to
 that
 uh
 because


as
 as
 business
 uh
 as
 business
 leaders


make
 decisions,
 trust
 is
 a
 really


important
 equation.
 Correct.
 And
 to
 be


able
 to
 uh
 understand
 everything
 from


the
 sourcing
 uh
 to
 be
 able
 to
 look
 at
 uh


multiple
 languages
 uh
 to
 be
 able
 to
 uh


use
 those
 standard
 uh
 analytical
 uh


techniques
 uh
 developed
 in
 in
 in
 the


intelligence
 tradecraft
 uh
 it
 it
 goes


beyond
 just
 the
 digital
 uh
 but
 as
 Sid


alluded
 to
 and
 is
 talking
 about
 uh
 it


really
 is
 about
 how
 can
 we
 also
 merge


that
 with
 the
 human
 component
 as
 well.


Uh
 and
 what
 we're
 seeing
 is
 interesting


uh
 what's
 happening
 and
 is
 those
 uh


those
 people
 who
 in
 the
 past
 were


creating
 those
 reports
 um
 are
 now
 uh


joining
 the
 decision-m
 team
 because
 it's


more
 about
 the
 impact
 of
 and
 the
 uh


strategic
 reaction
 to
 uh
 and
 uh


identifying
 more
 opportunities
 uh
 like


the
 situation
 in
 Ukraine
 where
 they
 can


make
 incremental
 decisions
 and
 those
 val


the
 decision
 is
 is
 is
 is
 ever
 more


valuable
 when
 you
 can
 actually
 take
 an


action
 to
 either
 prevent
 accelerate


right
 or
 uh
 change
 course.


>> Yeah,
 it
 really
 is
 amazing
 because
 I


think
 this
 this
 solution
 and
 this


partnership
 with
 Palunteer
 is
 so


transformational
 is
 because
 in
 this


world
 where
 it
 is
 more
 uncertain
 but
 it


also
 there's
 so
 much
 more
 noise
 out


there
 and
 getting
 clarity


>> getting
 signal
 through
 the
 noise


>> and
 signal
 with
 it
 from
 the
 noise
 is
 key


and
 that's
 what
 I
 think
 this
 partnership


enables
 and
 specifically
 that
 is
 even


more
 differentiating
 in
 the
 business


world
 today
 than
 it
 ever
 has
 been
 in
 the


past.


>> Agreed.
 uh
 what
 risks
 are
 there
 to
 this


intelligence
 briefing
 as
 a
 product
 and


as
 a
 like
 s
 a
 core
 software
 offering


that
 it's
 pulling
 from
 all
 this
 open


source
 data
 like
 could
 the
 data
 be
 bad


could
 the
 data
 be
 mistransated
 how
 do


you
 think
 of
 risks
 and
 then
 the


company's
 prevention
 mechanism
 for
 or


mitigation
 mechanis
 mechanism
 for
 those


risks


>> yeah
 I
 think
 it's
 um
 it's
 it's
 it's


interesting
 right
 I
 mean
 there's
 a


couple
 of
 different
 things
 that
 uh
 come


to
 mind
 uh
 first
 of
 all
 um
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 we
 leverage
 from
 the
 trade


craft
 of
 the
 intelligence
 community
 uh


is
 uh
 the
 standards
 ICD
 ICD
 206
 and
 203


uh
 which
 basically
 looks
 at
 and


understands
 uh
 how
 do
 we
 remove
 bias


right
 uh
 so
 whether
 we
 call
 a
 uh


country's
 leadership
 a
 regime
 uh
 you


know
 has
 specific
 consequences
 uh
 and


how
 do
 we
 remove
 that
 so
 it's
 about


what's
 happening
 and
 the
 decision
 um
 so


uh
 also
 I
 think
 as
 we
 start
 to
 think


about
 uh
 how
 uh
 a
 tool
 is
 only
 as
 good


as
 as
 what
 you
 put
 into
 it.
 Um
 so
 trust


as
 we
 talked
 about
 before
 is
 really


important.
 Uh
 but
 if
 you
 start
 to
 think


about
 like
 the
 chatbot,
 you
 know,
 what


is
 the
 impact
 of
 X
 on
 my
 business
 uh
 is


only
 as
 good
 as
 uh
 knowing
 the
 business.


And
 so
 where
 we're
 seeing
 is
 the


opportunity
 to
 extend
 and
 understand


both
 strategic
 growth
 uh
 key
 risks
 uh


and
 problems
 uh
 supply
 chains
 uh
 being


able
 to
 ingest
 that
 information
 uh
 in
 a


trustbased
 platform
 uh
 really
 allows
 us


to
 actually
 uh
 enable
 that
 decision


maker
 with
 the
 type
 of
 information
 they


need
 uh
 to
 see
 uh
 accelerated
 outcomes.


>> Right.
 And
 and
 I
 would
 also
 add
 to
 what


Jeffrey
 said
 that
 that
 uh
 ability
 to


pressure
 test
 what
 the
 AI
 produces


really
 comes
 from
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 cases


our
 clients
 actually
 have
 internal


intelligence
 teams
 which
 can
 be
 a
 veter.


Yeah.


>> And
 then
 at
 the
 same
 time
 we
 have
 our


230
 analysts
 that
 are
 trained
 in
 this


and
 they
 also
 vet
 such
 that
 there's


almost
 a
 um
 a
 a
 good
 seal
 of
 approval


test
 that
 has
 to
 happen
 before
 it
 really


goes
 right


>> to
 press.


>> This
 has
 been
 awesome.
 Last
 question
 for


you
 both
 Sid
 Jeffrey.
 Thank
 you
 guys
 for


taking
 the
 time
 to
 do
 this.
 Um,
 we've


been
 talking
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 AI,
 but


I'm
 curious
 about
 your
 perspectives.


Past
 three
 years,
 AI
 has
 taken
 over
 the


world.
 Palunteer
 has
 become
 one
 of
 the


largest
 AI
 companies.
 Um,
 how
 is
 AI


operationalizing
 your
 business?
 How
 are


LLMs,
 are
 you
 using
 LM?
 Are
 you


orchestrating
 LM?
 What
 is
 what
 does
 it


mean
 for
 you
 guys
 to
 be
 an
 AI
 first


company?


>> It's
 a
 great
 question.
 We
 think
 about
 a


how
 we
 can
 make
 AI
 first
 in
 everything


we
 do.
 And
 so
 it
 really
 is
 at
 the
 core


of
 every
 process.
 Not
 that
 just
 we
 we


use
 internally
 but
 because
 we
 use


internally
 we
 look
 to
 put
 it
 in
 our


externally
 facing
 products.
 And
 so
 it


really
 is
 something
 that
 uh
 we
 see
 as
 a


force
 multiplier
 for
 how
 we
 can
 take


what
 we
 do
 and
 expand
 that
 amongst
 our


our
 client
 base.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 uh
 one
 of
 the
 things


we
 talk
 about
 as
 a
 team
 often
 is
 uh
 we


have
 an
 AI
 enabled
 product
 uh
 but
 what


does
 it
 mean
 to
 be
 an
 AI
 company,
 right?


And
 uh
 you
 know
 with
 the
 pace
 of
 change


of
 everything
 there's
 so
 many
 different


ways
 that
 AI
 is
 touching
 business
 and
 uh


from
 our
 perspective
 what
 makes
 it


interesting
 is
 how
 quickly
 can
 we
 embed


uh
 what
 is
 uh
 in
 the
 market
 so
 that
 we


are
 consumers
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 Um
 but


as
 we
 think
 about
 the
 product
 uh
 you


know
 with
 mo
 uh
 with
 many
 models
 out


there
 and
 every
 day
 there
 seems
 to
 be
 a


new
 update
 to
 one
 of
 them
 uh
 what
 we're


finding
 is
 is
 that
 the
 the
 capabilities


of
 each
 model
 change
 uh
 from
 from


company
 to
 company.
 And
 so
 where
 we


might
 have
 something
 work
 with
 us
 to


write
 a
 report
 um
 then
 we
 might
 work


with
 another
 model
 to
 QA
 the
 uh
 the


report.
 Um
 and
 so
 um
 you
 know
 in
 that
 I


think
 that
 that's
 a
 good
 example
 of
 how


we
 see
 uh
 AI
 impacting
 our
 business.


>> Jeffrey
 Sid,
 thank
 you
 guys
 so
 much.


Pleas
 deeply
 appreciate
 it.


>> Pleasure.


>> Crisis
 24
 and
 Pounder
 at
 Paragon.


>> Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to
 the


channel.
 We
 are
 here
 at
 Pounder's
 end
 of


year
 event
 called
 Paragon.
 I'm
 here
 with


Steve
 who
 is
 the
 president
 and
 CEO
 of


Cubic
 Corporation.
 Steve,
 thanks
 for


being
 here.


>> Hey,
 thanks
 for
 having
 me.
 Nice
 to
 be


here.
 The
 thing
 about
 this
 event
 that
 is


super
 cool,
 I
 think,
 is
 that
 customers


are
 showing
 real
 use
 cases
 and
 showing


the
 partnerships
 that
 they're
 engaging


in.
 Uh
 for
 those
 that
 don't
 know
 what


Cubic
 Corporation
 does,
 if
 you
 can
 give


a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 background
 about
 what


it
 is
 and
 then
 we'll
 get
 into
 the
 use


cases
 in
 the
 press
 release
 that
 you
 guys


announced
 today
 with
 Pounder.


>> Yeah,
 sure.
 Yeah.
 Uh
 Cubic
 is
 a


diversified


transportation
 and
 defense
 company.
 We


uh
 kind
 of
 refer
 to
 it
 as
 we
 operate
 at


the
 intersection
 of
 technology
 and
 the


government
 and
 we
 really
 focus
 on


critical
 customer
 use
 cases.


>> Yeah.
 The
 uh
 interesting
 thing
 as
 well


about
 the
 press
 release
 that
 I
 was


reading
 today
 is
 that
 the
 intersection


around
 technology
 and
 government
 is
 also


really
 not
 easy
 to
 explore.
 I
 mean


Pounder's
 entire
 history
 started
 with


providing
 technology
 to
 the
 government


and
 those
 use
 cases
 ended
 up
 being


somewhat
 valuable
 and
 they
 turned
 into


the
 company
 they
 are
 today.
 So
 I
 guess


what
 is
 the
 core
 thesis
 of
 the


collaboration
 with
 Pounder
 and
 how
 has


that
 expanded
 into
 the
 use
 cases
 that


you've
 seen
 value
 in?


>> Yeah,
 you
 know,
 our
 our
 um
 our


partnership
 with
 with
 Palunteer
 is
 uh
 is


one
 that's
 leveraging
 the
 unique


capabilities
 of
 both
 companies
 primarily


to
 respond
 to
 the
 Department
 of
 War's


rally
 cry
 to
 prioritize
 speed
 and


innovation.


>> Right.
 And
 um
 you
 know
 if
 you
 look
 at


there's
 really
 two
 use
 cases
 that
 we're


focused
 on.
 One
 is
 around
 the
 supply


chain.
 Supply
 chains
 are
 antiquated.


They're
 not
 set
 up
 really
 to
 scale
 to


support
 uh
 the
 Department
 of
 of
 War's


needs,
 especially
 if
 they
 do
 need
 a
 a


serious
 ramp
 up.
 And
 uh
 so
 we're
 working


with
 Palunteer.
 We're
 going
 to
 be


utilizing
 their
 um
 supply
 chain


optimization
 software.
 We're
 going
 to


integrate
 that
 into
 our
 production


environment,
 completely
 transform
 our


supply
 chain.
 It's
 it's
 really
 an


attempt
 to
 unlock
 all
 the
 data
 that
 sits


in
 our
 disparant
 systems


>> to
 drive
 cycle
 time
 reductions
 to


provide
 real-time
 visibility
 into
 the


status
 and
 health
 of
 our
 supply
 base,


but
 ultimately
 to
 increase
 our
 capacity


and
 ability
 to
 go
 faster.
 So
 that
 that


hits
 the
 speed
 and
 innovation
 piece,
 and


that's
 really
 around
 the
 supply
 chain.


Can
 you
 speak
 a
 little
 bit
 to
 the
 uh


kind
 of
 core
 software
 offering
 of
 the


ontology
 at
 the
 intersection
 of
 your


business
 and
 why
 you
 guys
 thought
 that


over
 the
 other
 software
 providers
 made


more
 sense
 for
 what
 you
 guys
 are
 doing?


Yeah,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 think
 uh
 you
 know,


Cubic
 is
 a
 company
 that's
 been
 around


for
 70
 years
 and


>> and
 uh
 we've
 grew
 and
 expanded
 through
 a


lot
 of
 acquisitions.
 And
 so,
 as
 you
 can


imagine,
 what
 what
 what
 we
 have
 today
 is


a
 lot
 of
 different
 systems
 that
 don't


talk
 well
 to
 each
 other,


>> right?
 And
 so
 to
 stitch
 it
 all
 together,


a
 lot
 of
 manual
 effort,
 uh,
 a
 lot
 of


offline
 spreadsheets.
 And
 you
 as
 we


started
 talking
 to
 Palunteer,
 um,
 you


know,
 what
 we
 saw
 was
 an
 opportunity
 to


almost


clean
 sheet
 the
 way
 we
 do
 our
 supply


chain.
 So
 we
 see
 it
 as
 not
 as
 a
 kind
 of


an
 overlay.
 I
 mean,
 it'll
 it'll
 start


off
 more
 like
 an
 overlay
 to
 stitch
 our


systems
 together,
 but
 I
 think
 over
 time


as
 we
 start
 to
 really
 get
 into
 the


ontology,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 that
 we'll


probably
 want
 to
 clean
 sheet
 it
 around


it
 and
 then
 get
 rid
 of
 all
 the
 systems


and
 leverage
 the
 capability
 that
 way.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 and
 I
 think
 that
 the
 sort
 of


symbiotic
 relationship
 between
 Palunteer


and
 other
 companies
 is
 if
 you
 can
 clean


all
 the
 data,
 you
 know,
 something
 that


Paler
 says
 a
 lot
 is
 that
 the
 data


doesn't
 have
 to
 be
 clean
 in
 the


beginning,
 but
 it
 just
 has
 to
 have
 the


ambition
 to
 have
 the
 use
 cases
 evolve


from
 the
 ontologization
 of
 the
 data,


having
 all
 the
 data
 come
 in
 one
 place


and
 that
 really
 does
 tend
 to
 replace
 a


lot
 of
 other
 parts
 of
 the
 software


stack.


>> Yeah.
 Look,
 our
 I
 know
 our
 data
 is
 not


clean,
 but
 that
 doesn't
 matter
 what
 we


can
 actually
 use
 the
 system
 to
 clean
 the


data.
 So
 that's
 that's
 the
 way
 to
 look


at
 it,


>> right?
 Um
 the
 defense
 space,
 Department


of
 War,
 we
 have a
 new
 administration.


They
 have
 a
 different
 paradmatic


approach
 about
 how
 they
 think
 of


defense.
 How
 do
 you
 as
 a
 CEO
 think
 about


positioning
 Cubic
 uh
 for
 this
 rallying


cry
 that
 you've
 said
 the
 Department
 of


War
 is
 caring
 about?


>> Yeah,
 I
 I'll
 give
 you
 one
 specific
 use


case
 which
 is
 relevant
 to
 our
 our
 our


partnership
 with
 with
 with
 Palunteer.


We've
 been
 a
 a
 longtime
 provider
 to


Department
 of
 War
 and
 specifically
 the


US
 Army
 of
 their
 tactical
 edge
 computing


and
 networking
 equipment.


>> Right?


>> So,
 think
 of
 that
 as
 you're
 deployed
 and


you
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 set
 up
 command


and
 communication
 on
 the
 battlefield.
 We


do
 that.
 That's
 what
 we
 do.
 Um
 but
 if


you
 think
 about
 you
 know
 what
 the
 future


looks
 like
 uh
 and
 this
 opportunity


around
 an
 AI
 enabled
 battlefield
 and
 you


know
 what
 does
 that
 mean?
 How
 do
 you


take
 the
 decision
 time
 from
 days,
 weeks,


months
 and
 make
 it
 in
 seconds?
 How
 do


you
 improve
 the
 quality
 decision?


>> That's
 where
 hardware
 and
 software
 come


together.
 So
 we're
 a
 hardware
 provider


in
 this
 particular
 use
 case
 and


Palunteer
 is
 a
 software
 provider.
 And
 so


merging
 those
 capabilities
 into
 the
 next


generation


systems
 for
 the
 army
 is
 is
 is
 what
 we're


focused
 on.
 And
 that's
 a
 key
 part
 of
 the


partnership
 is
 how
 do
 we
 leverage
 the


software
 that
 they're
 building
 that's


going
 to
 reduce
 decision
 time
 and


quality
 with
 the
 network
 and
 computing


horsepower
 that
 we're
 providing
 in
 our


next
 generation
 products.
 And
 when
 you


say
 at
 the
 edge,
 I
 would
 imagine
 you


need
 a
 software
 partner
 that
 can


actually
 operate
 at
 the
 edge
 to
 make


this
 work.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It's
 it's
 uh
 for
 us,
 I


look
 at
 it
 as
 um
 um
 being
 a
 a
 hardware


provider,
 we're
 sort
 of
 agnostic
 to
 to


to
 software.


>> Um


>> what
 we're
 trying
 to
 do
 is
 help
 the
 army


or
 the
 department
 of
 war
 in
 any
 case
 um


operate
 in
 a
 completely
 disconnected


environment.
 So,
 you
 know,
 an
 imperfect


environment
 is
 one
 where
 um
 data
 doesn't


flow
 from
 satellites
 or
 drones
 to
 the


soldier.
 So,
 how
 do
 you
 get
 that
 data
 to


the
 soldier,
 right?
 And
 you
 can
 do
 that


through
 software
 solutions
 and
 you
 can


do
 that
 through
 merging
 software
 and


hardware
 and
 putting
 it
 out
 in
 a
 modular


use
 case
 where
 the
 soldier
 can
 actually


be
 forward
 deployed
 not
 connected.
 Yes.


but
 at
 the
 next
 opportunity
 to
 get
 the


the
 full
 connection
 of
 the
 so
 that's
 a


software
 hardware
 combination
 and
 that's


that's
 how
 we're
 trying
 to
 solve
 those


problems.


>> Steve,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 taking
 the


time
 to
 do
 this.
 Last
 question
 for
 you.


Uh
 this
 administration
 and
 particularly


the
 defense
 part
 of
 this
 administration


has
 really
 embraced
 AI
 and
 they've
 said


that
 we
 are
 going
 to
 be
 on
 the
 cutting


edge
 of
 AI.
 We
 want
 to
 win
 when
 it
 comes


to
 the
 adversarial
 nations
 that
 are
 also


embracing
 AI.
 How
 are
 you
 as
 a
 CEO


philosophically
 thinking
 about
 AI
 and
 at


the
 intersection
 of
 defense?
 Yeah,
 I


look
 I
 I
 we
 think
 we're
 uh
 probably


two
 years
 ago
 I
 would
 have
 a
 hard
 time


articulating
 what
 percentage
 of
 our


technology
 investment
 was
 in
 AI
 and
 now


I
 would
 say
 almost
 all
 of
 it
 is.
 So
 it's


it's
 it's
 it's
 really
 around
 for
 us
 we


think
 that
 we
 have
 to
 move
 in
 that
 that


direction
 quickly.
 Um
 so
 we're
 we're


embracing
 it.
 uh
 we're
 looking
 for
 use


cases
 that
 can
 be
 deployed
 quickly
 to


provide
 uh
 immediate
 benefit
 and
 then
 uh


iterating
 collaboratively
 with
 the


customers
 with
 partners
 like
 Palunteer


to
 make
 those
 improvements.
 And
 so
 for


us
 it's
 it's
 you
 know
 taking
 advantage


of
 commercially
 available
 software
 and


hard
 hardware
 and
 deploying
 it
 in
 a


rapid
 iteration
 environment.
 That's
 how


we're
 trying
 to
 bring
 the
 AI


technologies
 to
 the
 market.
 Steve,
 thank


you
 so
 much
 for
 your
 time.


>> Great
 talking
 to
 you.


>> All right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 We
 are
 at


Palanter's
 end
 of
 year
 December
 event


called
 Paragon.
 I'm
 here
 today
 from


Kavanaaugh
 Corporation.
 Joe
 and
 their


echo
 Jesse
 from
 Palanteer.
 Thank
 you


guys
 for
 doing
 this.


>> Happy.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 us.
 Yeah.


>> So
 Joe,
 let's
 get
 started.
 We
 did
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 small
 interview
 back
 at


the
 AIPCON
 number
 five.
 Uh,
 a
 lot
 has


changed
 since
 then
 and
 given
 the


presentation
 that
 I
 just
 saw
 an
 hour


ago,
 seems
 like
 a
 lot
 has
 changed
 in
 the


positive
 sense.
 What
 has
 happened
 since


you
 guys
 first
 started
 working
 with


Palunteer?


>> Yeah,
 well,
 we
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 up


front
 kind
 of
 building
 out
 our
 core


ontology,
 the
 foundational
 ontology
 we


call
 it,
 and
 you
 know,
 just
 recently,
 as


we
 saw
 there,
 we're
 just
 rolling
 out


more
 and
 more
 tools
 at
 kind
 of
 an


exponential
 rate
 just
 because
 we
 have


that
 clean
 ontology
 now.
 We're
 just
 able


to
 build
 tools
 really,
 really
 quickly.


And
 can
 you
 give
 the
 audience
 a
 little


bit
 of
 background
 about
 what
 Kavanaaugh


does
 and
 kind
 of
 what
 was
 even
 the
 the


philosophical
 reason
 to
 begin
 working


with
 pounder
 a
 year
 ago?


>> Well,
 yeah,
 we're
 we're
 just
 a
 heavy


civil
 construction
 company
 in
 Ottawa,


Canada.
 You
 know,
 like
 500
 big


excavators,
 shovels,
 trucks
 on
 the
 road


every
 day.
 And
 uh
 we
 just
 so
 happened
 to


stumble
 into
 a
 boot
 camp
 Palunteer
 was


putting
 on
 and
 we
 saw
 it
 and
 we
 just


went,
 "My
 god,
 they've
 done
 it."
 Because


we
 we're
 trying
 to
 connect
 their
 data


and
 you
 know,
 in
 construction,
 it's


Groundhog
 Day
 every
 day.
 Yep.
 And
 so
 we


were
 kind
 of
 sick
 of
 the
 status
 quo
 and


I
 was
 always
 the
 PowerBI
 guy,
 the


VLOOKUP
 guy.
 And
 as
 soon
 as
 I
 saw
 that


ontology
 objects
 being
 connected,
 you


know,
 there's
 a
 boot
 camp
 about
 our


trucks
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 god,


they've
 done
 it.
 This
 is
 now
 my
 life.
 We


have
 to
 we
 have
 to
 make
 this
 work."


>> I
 love
 it.
 Jesse,
 you've
 been
 their


Echo.
 Can
 you
 explain
 to
 uh
 the
 audience


what
 exactly
 an
 Echko
 does
 and
 how
 have


you
 seen
 their
 progression
 as
 a
 early


customer?


>> Sure.
 So
 I
 was
 there
 at
 the
 the
 first


boot
 camp
 that
 we
 ran.
 Um,
 so
 the


deployment
 strategist
 role
 is
 a


technical
 role
 at
 Palanteer
 where
 you


engage
 deeply
 with
 a
 customer
 to


understand
 their
 problems,
 feel
 their


pain,
 and
 help
 build
 the
 solutions
 that


they
 need
 and
 possibly
 solutions
 that


they
 don't
 know
 they
 need
 yet
 to
 really


help
 drive
 that
 goal
 forward.
 Um,
 and
 so


what
 we
 first
 started
 out
 with
 was
 just


kind
 of
 a
 simple
 problem
 of,
 hey,
 the


data
 is
 fractured.
 It's
 in
 different


places.
 Uh,
 we
 started
 with
 this
 idea
 of


just
 wouldn't
 it
 be
 nice
 if
 when


dispatch
 was
 working
 in
 the
 morning,


they
 knew
 what
 trucks
 were
 out
 for


repair.
 Just
 something
 simple
 like
 that.


And
 right
 from
 there
 as
 along
 with
 just


kind
 of
 the
 the
 job
 costing
 idea
 of
 like


hey
 when
 I
 submit
 something
 can
 I
 just


see
 if
 it's
 gotten
 through
 the
 process


yet
 like
 look
 at
 the
 approval
 stages


understand
 that
 so
 I
 can
 start
 to
 plan


tomorrow.
 From
 those
 humble
 beginnings


we've
 now
 rolled
 out
 40
 workflows
 in
 a


year
 stretching
 everything
 from
 safety


dispatch
 estimating
 built
 them
 an
 HRMS


system
 an
 OSDK
 app
 which
 is
 crazy.
 We
 uh


we
 started
 that
 we
 just
 didn't
 know
 how


hard
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be
 and
 just
 flew


through
 it.
 So
 it's
 it's
 on
 his
 phone


now.


>> Okay.
 So
 obviously
 the
 rate
 of
 growth
 is


exponential.
 You
 said
 97%
 of
 the
 the


companies
 using
 Pounder
 uh
 daily.
 You


also
 said
 that
 it's
 kind
 of
 replaced


pretty
 much
 every
 other
 software
 stack


that
 you
 guys
 have.
 Uh
 why
 has
 the
 rate


of
 growth
 been
 so
 exponential
 on


Pounder?


>> I
 think
 because
 we're
 making
 people's


lives
 easier.
 Like
 the
 main
 goal
 is


giving
 operations
 the
 tools
 that
 they


need
 to
 do
 their
 work
 dayto-day.
 And
 so


when
 you
 show
 up
 and
 the
 tools
 easier,


the
 adoption
 is
 just
 easy,
 right?
 The


adoption.
 You
 want
 when
 people
 get
 the


tools
 to
 go,
 "Oh
 yeah,
 that's
 exactly


what
 I
 needed."
 And
 this
 is
 easier.


We're
 trying
 to
 make
 people's
 lives


easier.
 That's
 the
 main
 goal.
 100%.
 A


>> as
 a
 construction
 company,
 I
 mean,
 you


named
 a
 couple
 of
 different
 use
 cases,


but
 uh
 to
 the
 audience
 that
 maybe
 has


never
 worked
 in
 a
 construction
 company


or
 even
 understands
 the
 challenges,
 can


you
 can
 you
 give
 us
 some
 examples
 of


what
 is
 so
 difficult
 about
 using
 an


Excel
 sheet
 to
 manage
 something
 versus


having
 it
 on
 Foundry?


>> Yeah.
 It's
 just
 the
 the
 connectivity,


right?
 Like
 it's
 the
 for
 a
 construction


analogy,
 we
 call
 it
 double
 handling


material.
 Like
 if
 you
 dig
 a
 hole
 and


fill
 it
 back
 in,
 that's,
 you
 know,


that's
 inefficient.
 So
 data
 is
 no


different.
 If
 you
 fill
 in
 a
 spreadsheet


and
 you
 have
 data
 somewhere
 and
 someone


has
 to
 look
 at
 that
 data
 and
 then
 retype


it
 in
 somewhere
 else,
 it's
 inefficient.


So
 we
 kind
 of
 see
 it
 the
 exact
 same
 way.


So
 spreadsheets
 are
 inherently


inefficient
 because
 they're
 not


interconnected
 with
 the
 rest
 of
 your


business,


>> right?
 Um
 Jesse,
 I
 was
 just
 talking
 to


Kevin
 who
 leads
 sales
 at
 Hounder
 and
 and


uh
 he
 was
 referencing
 Kavanaaugh
 and


said
 that,
 you
 know,
 Kavanagh
 is
 not


just
 running
 on
 Pounder
 Foundry.


Kavanaaugh
 is
 running
 on
 Kavanaaugh's


operating
 system
 that
 is
 powered
 by


Foundry.
 Can
 you
 speak
 a
 little
 bit
 to


uh
 a
 company
 making
 an
 operating
 system


versus
 a
 company
 just
 plugging
 stuff


into
 your
 operating
 system?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 part
 of
 that
 is
 that
 this


is
 the
 core
 philosophy
 of
 Palunteer
 is


that
 we
 meet
 the
 customer
 where
 they
 are


and
 build
 software
 that
 meets
 their


business
 needs
 as
 opposed
 to
 saying,


"Hey,
 cut
 the
 awkward
 parts
 off
 of
 your


business
 to
 meet
 this
 kind
 of
 cut
 cookie


cutter
 mold."
 which
 which
 is
 a
 difficult


conversation
 sometimes
 with


>> business.
 It's
 definitely
 a
 difficult


conversation
 but
 I
 think
 where
 we


started
 with
 was
 just
 the
 core


operations
 of
 hey
 what
 is
 a
 construction


company
 at
 its
 core?
 It's
 a
 company
 that


takes
 labor
 materials
 and
 equipment
 and


works
 against
 the
 contract.
 And
 so
 we


said
 great
 we're
 going
 to
 build


something
 that
 lets
 you
 manage
 all
 of


these
 pieces
 and
 then
 from
 there
 we'll


spring
 all
 of
 the
 other
 things
 that


interact
 between
 them.
 What
 is
 you
 know


a
 dispatch
 other
 than
 putting
 a
 person


in
 a
 truck
 against
 a
 job?
 And
 so
 from


there,
 you
 kind
 of
 start
 at
 the
 core
 and


build
 out
 from
 there
 as
 opposed
 to
 maybe


tacking
 like
 one
 workflow
 and
 then


trying
 to
 work
 down
 to
 the
 ontology.


>> Absolutely.


>> Last
 question
 for
 you
 guys.
 Thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 taking
 the
 time
 to
 do
 this.
 Um


the
 partnership
 here
 I
 think
 is
 really


special
 because
 Dr.
 Karp
 doesn't
 even,


you
 know,
 mention
 you
 guys
 as
 a


customer.
 He
 mentions
 you
 guys
 as
 a


partner.
 Um
 obviously
 the
 FTE
 model
 is


starting
 to
 get
 more
 adopted
 into
 the


enterprise.
 Now
 everyone
 wants
 a
 Ford


deployed
 engineer.
 How
 are
 you
 thinking


of
 the
 partnership
 with
 Palunteer
 versus


the
 sort
 of
 transactional
 vendor


relationship
 with
 a
 software
 company?


>> Yeah,
 I
 we
 feel
 like
 we
 are
 partners.


Like
 Jesse
 and
 I
 have
 a
 great


relationship
 where
 we
 were
 literally


locked
 in,
 we
 called
 it
 the
 training


room,
 but
 we
 were
 locked
 in
 a
 room
 for
 3


months
 whiteboarding.
 What
 is


construction?


>> Wow.


>> There
 was
 no
 pizza
 or
 beer
 at
 all.
 Um


but
 I
 think
 just
 that
 trust,
 right?
 Like


Jesse
 challenged
 us
 a
 lot
 on
 just
 the


assumptions
 we
 didn't
 even
 know
 we
 were


making.
 Like
 I
 like
 to
 think
 I
 get
 to


first
 principles
 and
 you
 know
 I'm


unbiased
 but
 you
 know
 there's
 so
 many


instances
 where
 Jesse
 would
 just
 well


again
 phil
 philosophically
 go
 why
 and


you
 go
 well
 crap
 I
 didn't
 know
 I
 was


making
 that
 assumption.
 So
 I
 think
 it's


just
 trust
 right
 like
 trust
 that
 they're


they're
 there
 with
 your
 best
 interest
 in


mind
 and
 they're
 going to
 tell
 you
 the


truth
 whether
 you
 want
 to
 hear
 it
 or


not.


>> Same
 question
 to
 you
 Jesse.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean


I
 think
 the
 partnership
 is,
 you
 know,
 as


we
 move
 forward,
 right,
 I
 wish
 I
 could


work
 on
 Kavanaaugh
 forever,
 right?
 Like,


uh,
 I
 love
 the
 work
 that
 we've
 done


there.
 And
 when
 we
 when
 we
 started
 this


this
 journey
 together,
 I
 didn't
 know
 too


much
 about
 construction.
 And
 so
 I


started
 by
 saying
 like
 I'm
 probably


going
 to
 ask
 some
 really
 stupid


questions
 here
 like
 why
 do
 you
 bother


doing
 costing,
 right?
 Or
 like
 why
 do
 why


do
 you
 care
 about
 dispatch
 or
 how
 does


estimating
 work?
 But
 I
 want
 you
 to
 trust


that
 like
 I'm
 only
 going
 to
 push
 when
 I


really
 don't
 think
 it
 makes
 sense.
 And


I'm
 going
 to
 learn
 this
 from
 you.
 And


like
 if
 you
 trust
 me
 that
 I
 have
 your


best
 interest
 in
 mind
 and
 that
 I'm
 the


expert
 in
 the
 software,
 I'm
 going
 to


trust
 that
 you
 have
 like
 this


partnership's
 best
 interest
 in
 mind
 and


you're
 the
 expert
 on
 your
 business.
 And


together
 we're
 going
 to
 revolutionize


construction.


>> I
 love
 it.
 Joe,
 Jesse,
 thank
 you
 for
 the


time.
 Appreciate
 you
 guys.
