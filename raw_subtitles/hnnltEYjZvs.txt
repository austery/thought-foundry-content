pal
 brought
 out
 his
 inner
 Jennifer


Holiday
 and
 said
 there's
 no
 way
 that


he's
 leaving.
 Uh
 the
 reaction
 though
 has


been
 predictably
 partisan,
 not
 a
 lot
 of


tears.
 I'm
 going
 to
 bring
 in
 Fed
 uh


Fedgu.com
 principal
 Joe
 Wang.
 And
 uh
 you


know
 Joe,
 uh
 so
 J
 Pal
 says
 that
 that


that
 this
 is
 not
 about
 the
 the


testimony,
 right?
 He
 put
 out
 a
 statement


and
 he
 spoke
 last
 night,
 but
 about


President
 Trump
 not
 getting
 his
 way.


What
 interesting
 what's
 interesting
 to


me
 is
 he
 also
 said
 that
 the
 Fed
 serves


the
 public.
 Listen,
 I
 believe
 the
 Fed


serves
 big
 banks
 and
 the
 wealthy
 folks


out
 there.
 Just
 your
 thoughts
 because
 I


think
 this
 is
 a
 perfect
 time
 to
 remake


the
 Federal
 Reserve.


>> Hey
 Charles,
 thanks
 for
 having
 me.
 And
 I


think
 what
 you're
 saying
 makes
 a
 lot
 of


sense.
 Now,
 when
 I
 look
 at
 the
 data,


what
 stands
 out
 to
 me
 is
 that
 over
 the


past
 few
 decades,
 labor's
 share
 of


income
 has
 consistently
 declined.
 And


what
 we
 see
 is
 tremendous
 asset
 price


inflation
 where
 the
 rich
 get
 richer.
 So,


it's
 easy
 to
 see
 that
 people
 could
 think


that
 the
 Fed
 is
 really
 serving
 the


wealthy.
 And
 many
 people
 feel
 that
 way.


So
 that
 I
 think
 that
 is
 a
 big
 problem.


But
 I
 think
 when
 the
 Fed
 chair
 is
 saying


that
 this
 isn't
 about
 this,
 this
 is


really
 about
 getting
 rid
 of
 me,
 I
 think


he's
 right,
 too.
 So
 what
 I'm
 looking
 at


is
 that
 the
 president
 is
 having
 a
 very


different
 vision
 of
 how
 he
 wants
 to
 run


the
 country.
 He
 wants
 to


re-industrialize,
 not
 just
 to
 help


middle
 America
 undo
 those
 trends
 of
 the


past
 few
 decades,
 but
 also
 because
 of


great
 power
 competition.
 So
 you
 can
 see


him
 going
 out
 uh
 far
 away
 to
 seize


natural
 resources,
 having
 those
 tax


incentives
 that
 Nancy
 talked
 about,


taking
 ownership
 of
 some
 private


enterprises
 and
 all
 this
 stuff
 is
 really


important.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 most
 important


parts
 of
 his
 re-industrialization
 plan


is
 to
 have
 lower
 interest
 rates.
 And
 so


I
 think
 the
 president
 is
 frustrated
 that


the
 Fed
 is
 not
 playing
 along
 to
 trying


to


>> uh
 basically
 re-industrialize
 and
 make


the
 economy
 work
 better
 for
 uh
 for
 the


public.
 So
 I
 think
 this
 is
 what
 the


president
 is
 doing
 trying
 to


>> re
 there's
 no
 doubt
 that
 this
 is
 what


President
 Trump
 is
 trying
 to
 do
 but


there's
 also
 no
 doubt
 that
 the
 Fed
 is


using
 a
 playbook
 that
 feels
 at
 times
 to


be
 antiquated
 even
 the
 data
 that
 they


use.
 I
 mean
 I
 read
 what
 you
 said
 that


pal
 and
 and
 the
 Fed
 they're
 more


powerful
 than
 ever
 before
 haven't


necessarily
 done
 a
 good
 job.
 So
 what


about
 the
 notion
 of
 some
 sort
 of


accountability?
 I
 mean
 real
 democratic


accountability
 not
 this
 twice
 a
 month


twice
 a
 year
 you
 go
 on
 Capitol
 Hill
 most


of
 these
 law
 uh
 one
 most
 of
 these


lawmakers
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 hell


they're
 talking
 about.
 They
 sound
 dumb.


They're
 pitching
 their
 ideas.
 They're


trying
 to
 get
 pal
 to
 to
 weigh
 in
 one
 way


or
 the
 other.
 None
 of
 them
 are
 really


enforcing
 anything.
 How
 do
 we
 enforce


get
 accountability?


>> Oh,
 that's
 a
 really
 tough
 question.
 So,


the
 Fed
 initially
 was
 just
 the
 lender
 of


last
 resort.
 Then
 it
 began
 to
 set


interest
 rates.
 Now,
 it's
 a
 huge
 bank


regulator.
 Now,
 it's
 doing
 everything


with
 its
 balance
 sheet,
 being
 an
 active


market
 participant,
 buying
 trillions
 of


dollars
 of
 securities,
 what
 it
 was
 doing


QE.
 So,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 something
 that


has
 changed.
 The
 Fed
 is
 a
 lot
 more


influential
 and
 powerful
 than
 it
 was


before.
 So
 we
 should
 have
 more


democratic
 accountability.
 It's
 hard
 to


get
 that.
 Like
 you
 mentioned,
 what
 the


Fed
 does
 is
 very
 opaque.
 So
 a
 lot
 of


people
 on
 Congress
 don't
 really
 follow


it
 closely.
 One
 way
 is
 perhaps
 to
 have


uh
 the
 Treasury
 Secretary
 sit
 on
 the


MOMC
 as
 it
 was
 initially
 in
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 Fed's
 founding.
 Another


possibility
 is
 is
 maybe
 that
 we
 just


make
 the
 Fed
 a
 little
 bit
 smaller
 in
 its


mandate
 so
 that
 u
 maybe
 some
 of
 that


power
 goes
 elsewhere.


>> You
 know,
 I
 never
 knew
 that
 the
 Treasury


set
 in.
 That's
 a
 that's
 you
 you
 taught


me
 something.
 I'm
 I'm
 glad
 you
 did.
 You


know,
 every
 time
 I
 read
 your
 work,
 I


learn
 something
 like
 the
 notion
 of


central
 bank
 independence,
 right?
 I


mean,
 it
 it's
 not
 chisel
 and
 stone.
 At


least
 it
 wasn't
 from
 day
 one
 when
 our


Fed
 was
 around.
 And
 we
 got
 a
 chart
 here


that
 shows
 that
 it
 barely
 exists


anywhere
 in
 the
 world.
 By
 the
 way,
 I


went
 to
 the
 Richmond
 Fed.
 They
 had
 a


great
 paper
 on
 this.
 It's
 no
 longer


available.
 We'll
 see
 what's
 up
 with


that.
 But
 just
 this
 notion
 of
 of


so-called
 Fed
 independence.
 What
 exactly


does
 it
 mean?
 It
 sounds
 good.
 Some


politicians
 grab
 on
 to,
 but
 what
 does
 it


mean?


Central
 bank
 independence
 sounds
 really


sacred
 but
 it's
 actually
 a
 really
 new


idea.
 Uh
 when
 I
 was
 looking
 into
 this
 I


was
 surprised
 to
 find
 out
 that
 the


United
 Kingdom
 for
 example
 first
 world


country
 did
 not
 have
 an
 independent


central
 bank
 until
 1997
 and
 before
 then


they
 were
 totally
 fine.
 Similar
 for


France
 and
 if
 you
 look
 across
 the
 ocean


you
 can
 see
 that
 China's
 economy
 is
 also


doing
 well.
 They're
 doing
 a
 lot
 of
 good


things
 there.
 They
 don't
 actually
 have


an
 independent
 central
 bank.
 So
 this


independent
 central
 bank
 thing
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 it
 is
 just
 dogma.
 We
 can
 have
 a


country
 that
 has
 low
 inflation
 and
 an


economy
 that
 works
 forever
 for
 everyone


and
 not
 an
 independent
 central
 bank.
 We


have
 other
 ways
 to
 make
 uh
 inflation


accountable.
 For
 example,
 we
 have


elections.
 What
 happened
 in
 2024?
 Uh


inflation
 was
 high.
 Vice
 President


Harris
 lost
 the
 election.
 So,
 we
 don't


really
 need
 to
 have
 an
 central
 bank
 to


get
 inflation
 under
 control.
 I
 think


that's
 just
 maybe
 an
 outdated
 idea.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 speaking
 of
 elections,
 you


know,
 when
 Trump
 when
 when
 when
 the
 it


seems
 like
 if
 if
 Pal
 is
 saying
 he's


working
 for
 the
 people,
 well,
 the
 people


elected
 Trump
 to
 be
 the
 spokesperson,
 so


maybe
 they
 need
 to
 interact.
 But
 before


I
 let
 you
 go,
 just
 30
 seconds
 to
 go.
 Uh


the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 had
 an
 article


suggesting
 that
 maybe
 some
 members
 who


had
 been
 spying
 the
 exits,
 they
 even


announced
 that
 they
 were
 leaving
 might


decide
 to
 stay,
 you
 know,
 to
 form
 a
 wall


uh
 with
 with
 J.
 Pal,
 right?
 To
 push
 back


on
 on
 on
 Trump.
 And
 of
 course,
 J.
 Pal


himself,
 he
 could
 stay
 after
 his
 term


expires.
 The
 chart
 behind
 me
 shows
 it's


only
 really
 happened
 twice
 before
 that
 a


Fed
 chair
 stayed
 after
 their
 term
 is


over.
 I
 think
 such
 a
 mutiny
 would
 hurt


the
 reputation
 of
 the
 Federal
 Reserve.


Just
 quickly
 your
 thoughts
 on
 that.


>> I
 think
 it's
 a
 really
 bad
 idea.
 Listen,


we
 everything
 is
 changing
 right
 now.
 We


have
 a
 new
 economic
 model
 that
 the


president
 was
 elected
 by
 the
 broader


public
 to
 do
 and
 part
 of
 that
 money


model
 is
 for
 the
 Fed
 to
 keep
 interest


rates
 low
 so
 that
 we
 can
 have
 a


reshoring.
 We
 could
 have


re-industrialization.


having
 this
 one
 man
 just
 kind
 of


stubbornly
 stand
 there
 kind
 of
 defend


the
 Ansean
 regime.
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 that


that
 accords
 with
 democratic
 principles.


I
 hope
 he
 doesn't
 do
 that.
 I
 think


ultimately
 the
 president
 will
 prevail.
 I


think
 the
 public
 is
 with
 him.
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 Congress
 is
 with
 him
 as
 well.
 So


I
 hope
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 there
 isn't
 any


more
 drama
 there
 that
 would
 that
 would


distract
 from
 what
 are
 really
 pressing


problems
 for
 the
 American
 public.


>> You
 know,
 I
 hope
 there's
 not
 either,
 but


if
 there
 is,
 Joe,
 I'm
 glad
 we
 can
 count


on
 you.
 Great
 stuff.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much.


Like
 I
 said,
 I
 always
 learn
 from
 you.


Always.
 Thanks
 a
 lot.
