We humans have stopped listening.
Wow, you all really listen to that.
(Laughter)
But it's true.
There's a language out there
that we all know how
to communicate really quite well,
but we’ve tuned out of.
One we’re innately fluent in,
yet forgotten how to hear.
I truly believe the key
to solving many of our crises as humans
is relearning to listen to this language.
What I'm talking about
is the sounds of nature.
I want to take you all
somewhere real quick, if that's alright.
I want you to close your eyes
and make a mental note
of how you feel right now.
You can be happy from the week, stressed.
It is a Wednesday
in the middle of the week.
Charmed already from my London accent
or annoyed by it.
Just be honest.
Now close your eyes and open your ears.
(Nature sounds)
Mmm...
How do you feel?
Different, right? A bit better,
maybe slightly more relaxed.
I saw quite a few smiles
playing across people's faces.
You were just transported to West Papua.
That beautiful melody
was a hooded butcherbird,
which, believe it or not, is carnivorous.
Didn't think predators
could sing like that, right?
(Laughter)
So what's happened?
Is it that you're all
nature geeks like me?
Maybe.
But it's probably because
we're all evolutionarily hardwired
to nature's sonic language.
See, we're so hardwired to it,
so much so, the birdsong,
choruses of birdsong,
the percussion of insects,
the symphony of amphibians
has all been shown scientifically
to trigger your
parasympathetic nervous system,
aka make you feel relaxed.
You probably also noticed
you were in a forest
and a tropical one at that.
It might seem obvious to mention,
but that was just
from you using your ears.
Look at you flexing your fluency already.
It's possible the birdsong
makes us feel relaxed
because it's been ...
a genuine signal from Mother Nature
that there's no predators around.
But it can't be all relaxing.
(Lion roars)
Hearing this from an unseen lioness
near you in the dark,
trust me, triggers a cascade of fear.
But one that's also practical
and proportionate.
Eerie, unusual silence
does the same thing.
It's no wonder that we're seeing a rise
in anxiety in cities.
We may be unknowingly subjecting ourselves
to an evolutionary stress.
See, nature sound does something to us.
It's often hard to put into words, true,
but our nervous system understands it
like a remote control.
Blindfold on, I bet I could put any one
of you in a biodiverse environment,
and you'd be able to tell me
if it was dawn.
(Nature sounds)
The middle of the day.
(Nature sounds)
Dusk.
(Nature sounds)
Or nighttime.
(Nature sounds)
That coo right there was a potoo,
which is a crazy word
worth looking up when you get home.
Each of these was recorded in the exact
same place in the Amazon rainforest.
The more biodiverse, the easier it is.
There's an even deeper level.
There are still First Nations
trackers alive today
that can tell you
there's an unseen predator
moving through the forest
in a northwest direction,
just from the change in birdsong.
Our ancestors were polyglots of ecology.
(Birdsong)
To listen was to know.
Inattention was
literally life-threatening.
Our ancestral grandmothers
and grandfathers
lived in an attentive relationship
to the songs of other species,
contributing to conversations
that span back millions of years.
But that fluency is still in you.
Why, for our entire evolution,
listening has been
a big part of our compass.
But now we turned that off.
It's no wonder that we lost our bearing.
So what's this got to do
with solving crises, Louis?
I'm glad you asked.
(Laughter)
Now my path to standing before you
here today is an unusual one.
I'm not exactly from a place
abundant in natural charms.
Born and raised in grimy old north London,
more common to hear sirens and music --
good music, I might add --
than birdsong.
Growing up in Ends,
my love of music led me
down the path to becoming a musician.
But I'm standing here today
as a massive nature geek.
Nice to meet you.
Even though I grew up in a city,
I've always been fascinated
by nature from day dot.
Yet it was something that me
and my friends had the least access to.
Yet many of us had ancestry
from nature-rich places.
For a long time I felt
that these two worlds
I had to keep separate.
How would you market a rapper
that can talk to you
about the complexities of h
with a full-blown degree of zoology?
But during COVID,
my amazing mom and sister
really persuaded me to combine the things,
the damn things,
a couple more swear words
I might add, but I won't say.
See, sound was the common denominator
between my two loves.
Yet ...
if there’s over 55 percent of us humans
living in cities and rising,
we don't get to experience this.
If I wanted people to reconnect to nature,
I needed to bring these sounds back.
So I built these omnidirectional mics.
These right here,
I bring with me wherever I go.
When I'm not being mistaken
for an alien with a probe,
I record.
The first time I did this,
something crazy happened.
I put my headphones on.
And I disappeared.
Not literally, of course.
(Laughter)
But I wasn't an individual anymore.
I was plugged into an overwhelming,
highly synchronous chorus of aliveness.
See, listening to these sounds ...
(Nature sounds)
... didn't just tell me information.
It made me feel ...
like ...
something like a soup of life,
a language that my DNA knew
that I fundamentally understood,
not as Louis, but as a human.
Surely this could be
a new tool for people,
particularly people from the diaspora,
to reconnect to the places that we're from
that are still abundant in nature there.
See, remember,
for a long history
of colonialism, extractivism
the transatlantic slavery diaspora
have been pulled not just
from the lands we're from,
but from the nature there.
Sounds as common as the rising sun
to our ancestors
are now our extinct in our experience.
But that's happening to all of us,
wherever we're from.
Reconnecting to nature is fundamental
if we're to have a future on this planet,
because planetary health
and our health go hand in hand.
See, nature sounds are so important
to us as a species.
We evolved not just
to hear the information,
but to have an emotional response to it.
That's probably why music
is so powerful for us.
It transcends barriers.
Where words fail, it adds meaning.
It resonates.
Many scientists believe
music predated language in humans,
inspired by mimicking the songs of Earth.
But we are relatively new
on the scene as musicians.
Try telling a nightingale
or humpback whale
that we invented music.
Mother Nature is the original artist.
Going back to that hooded butcherbird,
I can imagine that mimicking moment.
(Nature sounds)
(Soft electronic piano sounds)
What's crazy is I did nothing to this,
and I recognized this,
I was like, this is G Phrygian,
which is C minor for those
that ain't geeky in music like me.
But let's check with the harmonies.
(Music continues)
OK.
I can imagine people hearing this
and being inspired back in the day
to get musical with it.
But we've got to check the chords.
And obviously,
what is a song without bass?
(Bass guitar sounds)
(Sings) Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
You can meditate till you levitate
High off life till you’re featherweight
Try and fly till your feathers hurt
But listening to the world that made you
Will be how we elevate
Reconnect and things will change
I know things are shades of grey
But the future green if we make it
Get your melanin till your level raised
Let’s take a breath, let’s ventilate
Who you are inside is so OK
Just close your eyes, do this simple thing
Nature loves when you’re listening
Happiness is the realest rage
Give time to Mother Nature mate
All she needs is a simple thing
Nature loves when you’re listening
Nature loves when you’re listening
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Listen to this world
Says the hooded butcherbird
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Listen to this world
Says the hooded butcherbird
Tell you so!
Woo! Yeah!
Listen to this bird
Says the hooded butcherbird, tell you so
So listen to this bird
Says the hooded butcherbird
Tell you so
Listen to this bird
Says the hooded butcherbird
Yeah yeah
Listen to this bird
Listen to this ...
Listen to this bird
This hooded butcherbird
(Applause)
Yeah.
And that's my theory of ornithology.
(Laughter)
Scientist geeks like that one.
So it's not very common
for someone where I come from
to get to go to a rainforest,
let alone three in the space of a year.
Trust me.
But I was lucky enough
to be invited to West Papua,
to Dominica, or Waitukubuli,
as it’s more correctly known,
where one half of my family
are from in the Caribbean.
And the Sarayaku nation,
deep in the heart
of the Ecuadorian Amazon,
with the Moth Collective.
Each of these is
an indigenously stewarded place,
past and present,
and a biodiversity hotspot because of it.
When we were in the Amazon,
the Kichwa people taught us
about Kawsak Sacha.
It means "living forest."
Now it doesn't just mean
the toucans, the jaguars,
the tapirs.
(Nature sounds)
The many frogs you can hear right now.
No, it means the trees,
the rivers,
the rocks, the soil,
the fungi, the air, everything.
Just like the planet,
the forest itself is a living organism,
and we are like the organs
singing our functions to each other.
How good does nature sound
without colonialism?
See, listening to these beautiful sounds
of thousands of lives
and universes they inhabit ...
of course it’s Kawsak Sacha.
But of course it's why it's so hard
for us to connect in places
devoid of these orchestras of life.
We're in a climate crisis,
a biodiversity crisis.
There's wars, there's genocides,
there's depression, anxiety on the rise.
But at the heart of it all,
we're in a crisis of inattention.
We're like apples that have forgotten
the tree we come from is alive.
That not only is it alive,
but it bears many other fruits.
8.7 million, to be exact.
8.7 million other species
that we share this planet with.
(Nature sounds)
This is a nightjar,
that sounds like a laser.
How many songs and cultures
and stories are we missing?
We're not so neatly separable from nature,
and listening to it
doesn't just tell you that.
It makes you feel it.
Being more attentive
to nature's sonic language ...
might help us better exist with it,
because listening
requires embodied respect.
But we've stopped listening so much
we've almost not noticed
we're making it silent.
We run the risk of future generations
thinking that silence is normal.
(Sighs)
That's a bit embarrassing.
We've only just met,
and I already owe you lot an apology.
Now I've hopefully helped you listen,
I'm afraid you can't unhear.
You'll go outside and you'll notice
the beautiful birdsong.
But you'll also notice the drilling,
the beeping, the scraping,
the burning and the silence.
You can't unhear the symphony of nature,
but you also can't unhear
what we're doing to it.
But that's OK,
because noticing is the point.
We don't just
stand to be aware of what we
might lose,
but what we stand to gain
in a nature-filled future.
Awareness that nature
ain't a luxury, it's a necessity.
Our membership in life's conversation
is not one just to be observed,
but one we're part of.
(Nature sounds)
So go out there and change
not how you see the world
but how you hear it.
And changing how you hear it,
hopefully you'll never see it
the same again.
Thank you.
(Cheers and applause)
