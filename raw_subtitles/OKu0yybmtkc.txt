Now I'm going to start by getting you
to visualize sporting greatness.
And what do you see?
It's probably athletes like LeBron James,
Caitlin Clark, Saquon Barkley,
Simone Biles, Ronaldo, Messi.
You see, we tend to think of athletes
from quite a small subset of countries.
So I'd forgive you for thinking
that the best talent in the world
just comes from those places.
But that's not strictly true.
Because talent existed long
before their sporting greatness,
and many things
have to happen along the way
for them to realize their potential.
Now, one thing that's commonly overlooked
is that they got an opportunity
and were visible.
You see, talent exists everywhere.
It's finding the talent
that can be the challenge.
So how do we do that?
Now typically, that's scouting.
It's every young athlete's
dream to be scouted.
You see the old guy up in the bleachers,
he's writing his notes,
and later you get the call,
he wants you to try out.
It's a thrilling fantasy
for so many people.
There's only so many scouts.
Now I'm from the UK,
where Chelsea Football Club
have one of the most prestigious
and well-funded youth academy
programs in the world.
But each Premier League team,
or each Premier League scout,
can only see about 2,000 players per year.
But millions play the game.
And even from those 2,000,
it's already super limited
by the player's geography,
their cost factors, their access factors.
Lots of young people are now
taking that into their own hands.
They're uploading social media clips
of their best plays online.
But now we've just replaced
a human with an algorithm
that's not designed for talent ID
to decide who gets seen.
What do we do about that?
It's simply not possible
for Chelsea Football Club
to see every talent in the world.
Or is it?
You see, there's technologies now
like computer vision,
AI and deep learning,
that are helping us bridge that gap.
Now, personally,
I'm not a scout or a coach.
My route was biomechanics,
which is the science of motion.
And like many people in my profession,
we work in sports laboratories
or with clubs with a remit
of improving athlete performance
or reducing injury risk.
And I was working in my lab that one day,
my now founder and CEO, Darren Peries,
walked in with his son, Reef,
who was struggling with an injury,
and we started analyzing him
with all this wonderful equipment.
And we got talking
about the scouting problem,
and he noted just how unfair
and biased scouting could be.
He'd seen it himself.
Entire futures could be decided
in one day by one person
who has an opinion.
He noted how completely devoid
of data youth scouting can be.
And he said to me,
what if we took all this lab protocols,
all the data, all the equipment,
and put them into a set
of standardized smartphone drills
so any kid, anywhere in the world
could be tested fairly and equitably?
For me, it was a brilliant vision
to a genuine problem.
So I joined his team, ai.io,
where we build AI-based
solutions across all of sport.
Now the first thing we built was aiScout
for the problem at hand.
And here's how it works,
simply speaking.
Kid downloads an app for free
and they record themselves
doing these predefined drills
directly from the phone.
We use computer-vision AI
in the cloud to analyze that.
We analyze 22 key body segments.
We can even do things like
turn the 2D video into an inferred 3D
and bring all that together.
We get things like what direction
did they run, how did they turn,
how high did they jump, the speed,
the symmetry, the coordination, and so on.
But collecting that raw-level data
is just one part of the problem.
So you've got to know
how to interpret that data,
and you've got to be able to score
an athlete based on that data.
And most importantly,
you've got to make it specific
for those that are looking for talent.
Specificity is key here.
For example, in football --
soccer, for the Americans
in the audience --
each team or scout or coach
kind of look for a different thing
depending on what they need
at that given moment of time.
So some teams or coaches
might want athletes with power and pace,
others might want
coordination and technique
and great body movement.
So we have to make our scout,
we have to be tailored,
on that club-by-club basis.
Now to answer these questions
and really to build out that product,
we partner with two Premier League teams,
Burnley Football Club
and Chelsea Football Club.
And we started by just
asking them directly,
if we could analyze any kid
in the world, from a smartphone
and give you football-specific metrics,
what do you need to know
to make that relevant
to you and to use it?
And interestingly, they said,
comparable, benchmarkable, reliable data.
And above all else,
both themselves and the kids
they'd be analyzing,
would need to understand
where the data is coming from.
There can be no ambiguity.
So we started developing
these predefined drills with them.
They were ten-meter sprints,
counter-movement jumps,
they were dribbling through cones,
they were passing, shooting.
This is nothing new.
This was just genuine things
that scouts would normally look at
to make an assessment of a player.
And then we sat down with those scouts
and looked through a ton of video.
Do you prefer player A or player B?
Now it turns out the art of scouting
is actually incredibly complex.
So much of what experienced
scout does is really intuitive.
So whilst they knew
they preferred player B,
and maybe most of us can,
looking at the video here,
but they couldn't articulate it to us.
So we had to sit with them,
ask the questions,
and turn their insights
into something we could use to score.
We created the algorithm.
And with that algorithm,
we just pumped thousands
of videos through it.
So we started to make benchmarks
and standards across age and gender.
Because of course,
you can't analyze a 13-year-old
to a 22-year-old.
The 22-year-old is almost always
going to be bigger, stronger, faster.
You need to compare
13-year-olds to 13-year-olds
so you can really see who stands out.
And talking of standing out,
I'll never forget, when we were
first developing the app,
we recruited 50 college kids from the UK.
They were, honestly,
kind of average footballers,
except this one guy, Ben.
They all did our drills
and he was head
and shoulders above the rest.
Like, just really, really good.
Like, he was 17.
How has this guy
not been scouted before?
And the crazy thing is,
he lived just minutes down the road
from Chelsea FC training ground.
He wasn't in some remote village.
He was literally down the road
from one of the world's best academies.
The system didn't see him, but we did.
I'll cut a long story short here,
but this is where we knew
what we were building was working.
Because he got a trial
for Chelsea Football Club,
scored in his under-18 debut,
and he later signed for another
Premier League club
and even represented his country.
But that wasn't enough.
We needed to test this
in those remote places.
This should be for everyone.
Now, theoretically,
because all the heavy lifting
is done in the cloud,
the analysis of the video,
the processing, the scoring, the modeling,
it means that whether
you're from London or Mumbai,
if you've got access to a smartphone,
this thing can work.
And we're lucky to partner
with Reliance Foundation in India.
They have an amazing program where
they send scouts out every single year
to find the best 11-year-old talent
to give them five-year scholarships
to play sport and have free education.
With the best of those
generally going on to play
professional sport in India.
Same problem as Chelsea.
Few scouts can see a few thousand people;
potentially millions that are eligible.
So they turned to us
to try and find some
of those hard-to-reach kids
in difficult locations.
And they put out a call
on WhatsApp to their audience.
New to us to do this on WhatsApp,
but the parents and students
were asked to download an app
and do the drills inside the phone
and trial for Reliance Foundation
directly from aiScout.
Tens of thousands of kids
now do this every single year.
And the best ones, based on their data,
get sent to an in-person talent ID day
where the scouts make the decision
on who gets those scholarships.
It's a great example of how
we're augmenting the scouting process,
not just replacing their processes.
The best example of success was,
we've had many there,
is one player actually downloaded the app
from a shared community phone,
had never played organized sport,
and got himself a five-year scholarship.
On top of that, only last year, the IOC
and their partner at the time, Intel,
they reached out to us
about the up-and-coming Youth Olympics,
which is in Senegal.
They had a little concern that actually
the Senegalese national teams
didn't have enough talent
to fill all the teams
that are going to be
in those Youth Olympics.
Now, here's the great thing
about the technology.
You want to play football?
You can trial for a football
club through our app.
You can also do the opposite.
Based on your strengths,
it can tell you what you might be good at.
So if you've got great acceleration,
great reactive strength,
it could be rugby sevens or futsal.
You've got great upper body power
and hand-eye coordination.
It could be a baseball or a softball.
And that's exactly what we did.
We put the app into tablets,
we gave it to military leaders
and school teachers,
and they just stood there
and they recorded the kids in their class.
A few days into that,
thousands of kids later,
40 are now being trained
ahead of those Youth Olympics
in things like wrestling
and athletics and football.
Now, where does this go from here?
So the app today runs
through partnership programs,
talent ID initiatives,
with clubs, with federations,
sometimes there are
brand partners on the app,
where hundreds of thousands of kids
trial and do these drills.
Hundreds of those have had
successful outcomes
and now playing professional sport.
And where do we go from here?
Actually we go global with this, right?
So it's now multi-language,
it's starting to roll out into the app.
Multi-cloud is coming.
So it can be cloud-agnostic,
which means we can put
country-specific things into the app
in any region that we need to work with.
And right here, in the US,
proud to announce the MLS,
or Major League Soccer
as we know it here,
have rolled this out
to the MLS NEXT program.
45,000 kids right now are using
the app three times per year.
Preseason, mid-season, postseason
so we can track and monitor
their changes over time.
And the great thing is,
the scouts and the coaches
get all the data in real time
via our control center.
It's not a black box,
but something they can trust
and learn from the data
and see where that data is coming from.
And where else do we go?
It's probably not a big leap
for you all to imagine
how we start to move into things
like at-home healthcare and medical.
But we're also starting to create
the kind of movement libraries
for American football, for basketball,
for baseball, for cricket.
Because the underlying
movement primitives,
the cut, the deceleration,
the jump, the throw, the strike,
they translate well
across quite a lot of sports.
Because one thing in sport is always true.
Talent is universal
and brilliance exists
in every corner of the globe.
Now, with technology
and your very own smartphone,
you can make that talent visible
and level the playing field.
Thank you.
(Applause)
