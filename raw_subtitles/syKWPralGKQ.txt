俄武戰爭三年之後,現在到了關鍵性時刻局勢很動盪,而結果會對未來的整個世界格局造成重大的影響這個戰場上也有中國公民,有人在為俄羅斯打仗而有人在為烏克蘭而戰最近節目中,我會採訪雙方,來了解他們不同的立場和價值觀同時也借助他們的眼睛,來看一看媒體記者很難抵達的戰爭內部究竟發生了什麼 Today I will be talking to Macaroon, a Chinese mercenary in the Russian army. He was interviewed in the underground 对对对,因为他有这个无人机嘛,有的时候飞过来就给他打掉了我知道你现在这个所在的这个位置比较特殊所以在你能说的范围内告诉我们一下,你大概在什么地方这个没关系,这个位置我可以直接说就是巴赫木特我们在这个俄罗斯军队在2022年的10月份 I started to fight in August, and I won in May, 2023. But the fight around here has always been fierce. What kind of character are you? I'm a striker. What does the assault team do? We are going to continue to attack and infiltrate this area. Because we are quite close to the enemy's fire zone. The closest one is probably 5 or 6 kilometers. When you talk about us and the enemy, you can imagine that this program will cause a lot of controversy, including criticism of you. 你有心理準備嗎?我覺得這個沒有什麼,既然選擇這條路當我意識到我在這裡戰鬥的時候我可能在某一天我會由於戰爭會死在這裡所以說我決定分享一些比較真實的事情吧因為我們國家中國人已經很久沒有經歷戰爭了我想告訴他們一個普通的士兵尤其是外籍士兵在戰爭當中究竟會經歷什麼你想跟中國人說的是什麼呢? 我希望中國還是保持一個穩定的角色就是不要輕易的去研發戰爭或者說是加入到戰爭可能很多人看這個一些神劇啊拍的一些比較誇張的一些像戰狼啊包括亮劍啊什麼的看著這個熱血沸騰慷慨激昂的其實真正的真實的戰場是非常殘酷的就是 簡直如同地獄一般馬卡龍自己曾經是戰狼和亮劍的觀眾他生於1995年山東人曾經在軍隊服役俄國戰爭爆發的時候他是一名團艦教官2022年2月24日普京宣布對烏克蘭展開特別軍事行動我做了一個特定的軍事行動 烏克蘭總統哲聯斯基回應 3月2日,聯合國大會通過決議,譴責俄羅斯對烏克蘭侵略。表決是140個國家支持,5個國家反對,中國投了棄權票。馬卡龍在2023年11月份持旅遊簽證,抵達莫斯科參軍。既然這場戰爭沒有人邀請你,也沒有人逼迫你,也不是你的戰爭,為什麼你要參戰? 其实很多原因吧 首先这个金钱是一部分原因当然它不是绝对的原因啊 就是它这个收入因为不是很高嘛然后加上我自己本身以前也是军人 在中国我没有经历过战争 不知道什么是战争其实我之前我就想去法国 法国外籍军团对 我当时想去那里 但是签证也是一个麻烦问题 这个欧洲的签证吧,不是太好办的如果当时乌克兰那边的签证,办理起来也同样的容易你会去乌克兰吗?这个假设的话,我觉得有可能吧,有可能 確實是有可能的我認為很多中國人在這邊俄羅斯軍隊至少有幾百人但是在對面烏克蘭軍隊也有但是人數極少我認為可能跟這個簽證有一定關係再一個就是可能很多人認為幫助俄羅斯就是幫助中國根據鳳凰衛視記者盧玉光的報導第一位在俄羅斯陣亡的中國工英兵叫趙瑞 他参战的原因是听说在那里可以打日本人和八国联军。目前尚不清楚赵瑞是否知道俄军是当年的八国联军之一。中国的雇佣兵群体引用更普遍的爱国主义话语,使中俄纯王始寒,反对北约东扩,坚信自己在必胜里侧。 Listen to me, everyone! Hello, comrades! Thank you, comrades! I will be the first to fight! I will be the first to fight! OK? But the Chinese people's sentiment towards Russia is always complicated. 開戰之後,曾經有一份俄羅斯侵佔中國領土順序表,在社交媒體傳播。說,俄羅斯的行為不就是當年日本侵佔中國,成立維滿州的行為嗎?這種壓力,使一些參加了俄羅斯軍隊的中國人,也不得不為自己辯護。有人跟我說,說我什麼認什麼什麼,做富來著。 首先啊,你要搞明白,是誰給我開工資,是誰給我飯吃。我回來,你給我飯吃嗎?對吧? To be honest, you are the best. It's that simple. You can't even eat enough, why are you still talking about my interests? Chinese mercenaries use social media to bring music and military training to the public. Many people are fighting and bringing fire. 很多人在国内负债啊就是没钱放手一搏才就来这边就一条命可能就想没了就没了呗可能很多男人对这个对这个战场的向往很多人私信我很多很多人我都不回这些消息我以前还劝我现在不劝因为人太多了有什么国内的这个就业环境不好呀负债呀他现在给你报酬怎么样呢 正常吧,每個月和人民幣一萬五左右吧,我也不知道啊,但這邊購買力又不太行,我感覺這邊一萬購買力可能也就等於國內倆槍斧啊,尤其是主要是他這個付出和收入不成正比,我在這一年三百點五天。 No vacation, no rest I can't sleep every day, and it's a high-end job You feel, right? There is no freedom June 4, 2023, the Ukrainian armed forces Rebelled against the Russian territory from the southeast This is the critical moment of the war 此前一年,俄罗斯在自己国内的动员征兵,引起了强烈的社会反弹。他开始转变策略,用奖金和男子气概来招募病员。 马卡龙不会俄语,但是他先在敦巴斯加入了亲俄的民兵武装,又在2024年5月份与俄罗斯国防部指挥的正规军签了合同。在巴赫木特战役中,俄罗斯国防部指挥的正规军主要负责外围炮击,阵地争夺战都交给了瓦格纳雇佣兵,尤其靠他们招募的大量囚犯来发起死亡重逢。 Before Macarons entered the training camp in Moscow, they didn't know this information. Maybe someone will think that you are being treated as a cannon fodder. Actually, it's true that it's a little bit harsh. Why go home and be a cannon fodder? I didn't know he treated me like a cannon fodder before you came. From the training camp in Moscow, there was a serious racial discrimination. 其实这个黑人其实这个中国人其实我为什么要给你卖命的这个俄罗斯指挥官他就骂这些黑人啊说是什么就是很难听的那种种旧歧视的话说这个阿拉伯人说中国人说这个现在战争现在就是战争战争结束之后把你们通通都杀掉是怎么样就是不要活着回去确实这是事实说的是要把谁杀掉 说要把我们杀掉我不知道是开玩笑还是说他来自这个内心深处的这种歧视啊我不知道然后我们当时的翻译他就不干了他也杀了过人他是埃及人他不干这个翻译了我认为这个指挥官非常恶心他跟我说了这一切我当时我也说我说我不想在这个地方待着我要退出我要解除合同他们当时告诉我就没办法解除合同 Before signing the contract, Macalor had used a translation software to check the contract. One of the words in the confirmation was that the contract could be terminated within three months. But when he proposed it, the answer was impossible. Macalor had no choice but to quit. He got a weapon. It's a gun with nearly 80 years of history. Yesterday, the commander sent me a gun, a machine gun, but I don't know what it is. But I look at the year of the machine gun, I look at the year of the production, 1948, a year earlier than the time of the country's collapse. I look at this old antique, can it fight? I feel better now I will show you my gun I forgot to tell you the story of my gun look at the bottom there are four bars what does it prove? this gun has four rings when I shoot, tell me this gun is too broken, I said I don't want it whatever you say, send it to me 我说我不用破枪他说这是你必须得到的东西他说这把枪已经有四个人因为他而死了因为他牺牲了所以他下面做了一个标记画了四道横杆至于他们是死的怎么死的我也不太清楚 马卡龙发给他的工资,自费买了头盔、防弹服和其他装备。但是他去医院看病的时候,被直接拉到了前线,装备却没有给他。在战场上,我自己保命的东西你不给我。他给了我一些这个阵亡的士兵的一些装备,破破烂烂的。头盔上面甚至还有洞,他就给我这个东西让我去战斗。你自己出钱购买的装备,为什么不给你呢? I think they don't care about it. Because war is more urgent. People are being dragged here and there. No one cares about equipment. So from your perspective, they don't care about your life and death? 對 其實可以這麼來說 因為在戰場當中我們是進攻方突擊隊 傷亡很大就是人去了 基本上活著回來的不多是一個什麼樣的概率 大概我的經驗來看 就是我們陣亡三到四個人或者五到六個人 對面烏克蘭人陣亡一個人是這樣的一個交換點 That man shouted, "The first battle with me, with me, will win Sun Ruiqi, finally on the battlefield." I looked at his social media. He recorded a senior soldier in this large army. All the equipment is just a plastic bag. There was only a body of clothes in this plastic bag. 他问其他士兵是怎么回事那些人告诉他因为所有人包括那位士兵本人都认为他会很快阵亡两个星期之后那位士兵不见了而没有人问其他的命运这是马卡龙在前线用视频记录的一些物资情况他经常用蜡烛或者瓦斯来加热一点面条大米很匮乏而储藏面包的口袋被老鼠咬破 Russian soldiers would fight each other in the struggle for the goods. During the holidays, they would send chocolate, ham sausage, tea or coffee to the soldiers. After sending it to Macaron's hands, they would take it back after taking pictures. I said, "Why don't you give me these things? Why don't you take pictures of me? Why don't you give me these things? What do you mean by taking pictures and taking them back?" 经常出现这种事情。好像听上去有点像某种程度的腐败。可能是吧,这个东西,在军队当中,尤其在战争当中,指挥官的权力是很大的,士兵的生命,对,是很,可以说是很渺小。同一时期,在俄军南部军区,周志强和赵瑞记录了2023年11月11日他们第一次作为步兵上前线的经历。 大马都不把我们当颜柯了,和港事队没什么区别了。叫我们去抢战,抢完不派验和,张颜过来,我们伤亡惨重。几十号演完战,最后就上六旗,被输完和无缺的。从11月18日起,他们被乌军围困。这是赵瑞拍摄的视频。 这是被围的第三天被围的第三天这个人受伤了送不出去在这等死了被围的第四天昨天晚上连夜送这个商人出去送不出去组织了突围也没办法 這是被圍困的第五天 昨天晚上巫軍發動夜襲就剩這麼幾個人了 就剩這麼幾個人了 扛不住了 这已经是被围困的第六天了昨天晚上物军的装甲车坦克都已经出现在这个据点旁边了但是他可能没有发现我们 因为天色也较暗他打到另外一所房子 差一点,差一点。被围住六天之后,11月24日,他们都已撤出。来的时候,一车人,还剩几个吗?数到过来了吧?就剩这么几个人了?还想来吗? In a short message, Macaroon told me that his experience is an average of three days in the survival time of one person in the fire area. The night before, we went to have a raid. I brought ten bulletproof vests, ten buns, five grenades, and a raid in the middle of the night. We are on the fire line, and then our guns and the guns on the other side have been blowing up the fire line. Including our fighter jet, it hurts a lot of us. 咋说呢一言难尽打得挺惨的而他得到的防弹装备是两块生锈的铁板好东西两块防弹插板纯铁板刚从上面拔下来的 就他们有点沉了不错为了药回用来保命的头盔和防护装备马卡龙向俄罗斯军事警察投诉了指挥官他的投诉很快就有了结果大家好我是红色马卡龙这老毛子把我锁在这把头都抬不起来 给大家报个平安在这已经11天了但是一切都很好很多人正在试图帮助我因为投诉长官马卡龙被关进了地牢这是一个加着铁栏的深坑三四平米大人在其中止不起药每天只有上厕所的时候能离开一次俄罗斯的独立媒体Important Stories通过目击者证词和卫星对比图验证了俄军中存在惩罚士兵的地坑 和馬法隆一起同樣囚禁的地牢中的還有兩名俄羅斯士兵為什麼要用這種方式來懲罰士兵?另外兩個人他是不想去戰鬥就是說我們因為你也知道俄羅斯軍隊他一直是往前去突進的我們一直而烏克蘭人基本上一直是防守他們兩個不想去他們兩個只想防守他們兩個不想去殺人後來怎麼樣?對 I can't tell you about one of them, but I can tell you about something that is too dark. You know, the consequences are hard to bear. Due to the safety considerations of the interviewer, I was absent from the details of this matter in the program. What can be confirmed is that these two Russian soldiers did not change their ideas in the end. 在地牢關押了21天之後,因為恐懼,馬卡龍在上廁所的時候逃跑,從廢棄民房的三樓跳下,逃到了另一番號的俄軍部隊,堅決要求脫離原指揮官。 I remember that I had two fights. Not that I couldn't beat him, but he had a gun. But when it comes to war, the military sometimes cares about the sense of honor. Indeed. Including the first time I was released from prison, I didn't have any... I have too much desire to fight. I fight for you like this, you put me in prison. And treat me like this. I think I lack respect. Have you ever thought about leaving the battlefield and leaving completely? Go home. But there is no way. I don't think the Chinese embassy will help me. At this time, Sun Ruqi, who once shouted that he would win the first battle, finally went to the battlefield. Soon after, he became a hot spot again. I walked for nearly 40 minutes, and it was snowing, so I got a little signal to send this message to everyone. I contacted the Chinese and Russian Embassy and their report. 他说是个人行为不管我现在请求广大网友也请求广大的中国朋友们帮助我联系中国外交部我现在需要解除合同我要回国休养这边没有任何医疗条件没有任何的医疗设备我要死在这里了 也许大使馆他们的考虑觉得说你完全是个人行为然后国家也不赞成也不同意你们就自己来了所以我们不能够干涉我认为其实对有一些东西吧像这个战狼拍的一些东西太虚假了一本中国护照就是通往最安全地区的通行证这叫什么 这叫中国人牛逼当你的真正公民是我们自愿参加这个战争的但是 你知道印度人們他們以前也很多人這邊然後這個總理莫迪過來了跟普京談了一談所有的印度外籍工人都回國了呀都結束活革都回國了呀BBC的報導確認了馬卡龍的說法在印度一士兵傷亡慘重發視頻求救之後2024年7月份印度總理莫迪訪問莫斯科對普京談到此事兩個月後90多位印度工人兵被釋放回國 而中国雇佣兵中,那位说过有奶便是娘的典狱长,发现他的合同到期之后也不能离开。我们老大找我谈过话了。他说,战争胜利以后,你的合同才能结束。而且他们计划要把我带去,送我去带领风暴Z里面最恐怖的一个当务,黑曼巴。 哎,这搞的什么?连我自己都无词带就带吧,合同不结束就继续干,对吧?呆也不是说那种 不敢干的咱丢不起那个人不但逃兵我手底下有两个逃掉了现在在全力追捕再抓回来的话那是必死无疑的我呢继续他们有血性怕个单 不久之后,点玉掌的抖音账号发布了他阵亡的消息,要求粉丝们纪念这位伟大的国际主义战士。这个视频的IP显示在河南,宣称是他的河南助理发布。 粉絲們還沒有悼念多久,就看到了一場宣稱點一張《詐屍復活》的直播。稱他熟讀兵書,精闡脫俏,已經戰術性撤退到了莫斯科。而孫瑞奇也宣稱他靠個人之力回了國。他們具體是怎麼回去的,我能查到的信息很有限。從未沒報導看,雇傭兵中曾經有人用槍打傷自己脫離戰場,或者通過行賄來離開顯現。但逃跑幾乎沒有可能。 你自己能就彻底跑掉吗?比如说我就撤离战场,我就一个人走,有没有可能?不可能,周围全都是这个检查站,而且你说完了我跟你说在周围这个地区,别人给你开一枪给你打死,对吧?我觉得这地方没有法律,没有道德,没有这些优势。 I don't think there are any questions about this. Our interview was interrupted by Russian soldiers. In a battle between a language-impaired country, I could feel the tension, fear and uneasiness of the Macarons. 因为我觉得地上不适合外国人比如说你炮弹可能打过来了让你往趴下你都不知道让你往左边走你往右边走对不对你就是很大的一个障碍严障碍上来厕所然后回来的时候我看地上这是什么一根线一根半线就一旦我触发这根线 就是我必死无疑我这一看我就刚好跨过去这是什么 这是一根地雷然后我回屋我就问他我说外面有地雷你为什么不告诉我埋的这个鬼雷为什么不告诉我如果出了埋的的人其他的同队的队友都不知情吗其他人可能知道但是可能都已经阵亡了管理是非常的无序的我可以这么理解吗对 上次就是这样的混乱确实很混乱 In the southern battle zone, Zhou Zhixiang said the same confusion. When Zhengduo was in good shape, his teammate, a Nibiru mercenary, kept shooting with a gun and killed his own people. The wounded soldier ran away and was hit by a mine. Zhou Zhixiang's Ukrainian soldiers were the Ukrainian who became his grandfather. 在面对面时,对方扔下枪跑了,连保险都没有打开。截至2024年10月份,美国国防部消息,俄罗斯士兵超过了60万人伤亡。但乌克兰的抵抗和反攻也付出沉重代价。同年8月,泽连斯基说,乌军有43000名士兵阵亡。 37萬名士兵受傷 有些细节我没法描述 很血腥在你选择这个人作为你的敌人之前你有没有想过说他是一个敌人吗还是他是一个受害者其实说实话从乌克兰人的立场来说我们的确是侵略者因为我们去攻击了他们的 The Russian soldiers took over their land. From the Russian's point of view, it was to maintain peace in the Donbass region, to prevent the North from breaking through. Actually, I don't have any position. You chose one side, but not the other. In fact, you have to decide who your enemy is, or what you want to defend. To me, it's not really a job. Do you know that most of your jobs are about killing people? We are attacking. When we are far from the enemy, they will find us. They will find us and kill us. Then fire and fight back. In fact, when we can really stand up to the enemy, face to face, face to face, or very close, In fact, this time is very little, very little, almost not very much. I think your answer just now is a little bit of a return. In fact, you know they exist, and you will face them, right? Yes, in a certain situation, I will face them. When you face such a real person, the moment you raise your gun, Have you ever asked yourself if what you did was right or wrong? The situation at the battlefield is that a few seconds of time may mean the life and death of a person. In fact, it's very fast. So I don't have time to think about these things. What I think about the most every day is how to survive this cruel war. Do you have no time to think about this problem or are you worried that your own reflection will cause weakness and affect your life? I think both of them have. When I hesitate, when I think, when I am emotional, I am very passive. It may lead to the same result as theirs. So I am gradually numb. I think I am very numb now. The Bahamut in Macaron is the most bloody battle site in the Russian War, with the longest time. This city once had 70,000 people. Schools, hospitals, churches became ruins and a good place to live. Cats and dogs had nowhere to go. "Catch him." 我的猫,关系特别好出来侦查一下情况没事就跟着我 Look at him, he's looking at me happy I usually feed him some canned food when I'm free This is for my brother Come over and sleep with me at night Pretty good Look, the hair is all gone, it's hot It's all burnt on the stove You know you're standing in someone else's house, in someone else's city You also know this is a destructive job 你是一个对小猫味同情心的人,对吧?所以我想我的猜测是你对人人也是有感受的。我其实前段时间我在这个小红书,你知道小红书吧。对,我看到这个一个乌克兰人啊,他发了一个帖子,就是说他说这个巴赫姆特,就是我现在这个城市啊,他说以前我的家,祖祖辈辈都生活在这里,但是我现在因为战争,我不得不离开这个地方。 然后我给他发回复了一个消息我说我现在就在巴亨特我说你家在哪我说早就已经变成了废墟了我说这个对这就是战争我也知道就是没有办法的事情其实我内心感触还是挺多的我希望和他成为朋友因为如果这是我的家乡我的家乡被摧毁了我的房子被摧毁了 I feel very sad when I am occupied by the enemy. This is a human nature. I can only comfort him. And then maybe it's a try to deceive or numb myself. Tell yourself this is war. Ma Kun, I feel that you have two words deep in your heart. Fighting each other. Yes, because I joined the camp, I can only act according to the camp's pattern. But I have my own thoughts and feelings. I have been treated unfairly and unfairly by the Russians. So I do have some contradictions and difficulties. Except for the war, most of the time, Macaron sat in the dark, listening to the gunfire of the five-finger gun. Before the Russian war, he broke up with his parents and broke up with his girlfriend. This year, half of the soldiers he knew in the training camp were basically dead. Some of them were alive, and they had a mental breakdown. There was a red beard, and I don't know where he went. Look, I have a mental breakdown every day. 習慣了已經 人說沒就沒了在這邊有很多人受傷 受傷之後去醫院去醫院他有的時候偷偷喝點酒 喝完酒之後整個人就跟那個精神病是一模一樣的我感覺這邊很多士兵都是這樣因為有些人在這兒戰鬥了不止一年了兩年了 三年了 都有確實都有一點極端 有些士兵甚至吸毒在田縣能夠拿到毒品嗎 I don't know about that, but some people do have some channels. Because in these Ukrainian cities, I don't know much about the importance of the flatness of the city. When I don't smoke on the front line, when I'm on the road, I have to shoot a bomb to get a smoke to ease my anxiety. [BLANK_AUDIO] 又看到你了老宝贝跟着干啥呢我就感到说你被围困在那个地下那个特别黑暗的也是挺绝望的你我状心理状态 对,就是黑暗潮湿,然后又没有办法跟别人聊天来缓解情绪,其实你说实话感觉蛮难受,但对我目前来说,我就无所谓了,就是习惯了嘛。其实能活下去有的时候就要挺幸福的。当然了,如果不能活下去也行,你给我来一个痛痛快快的,是吧,你别折磨我,痛痛快快的一下。 我也能接受,我最接受不了的就是你想活活不了,想死又死不了它不一下給你殺死它可能給你的腿炸斷了之後你在地上爬,它又把你胳膊炸斷了最後,對,它會這樣 So this is war. Both sides are the same. Because of this kind of painful fear, Macaron always brings a grenade. Prepare to attack. Leave the last grenade to yourself. Many Chinese mercenaries died in the bombing of the UAV. According to this statement, they met UAV bullets after the attack and battle. 他發現趙瑞的時候,趙瑞渾身是血,睜眼,仰天躺著。周志強的腿被炸斷了,他用裝死逃避轟炸。六個小時裡,斷斷續續的爬了一公里,離開了交火區。在熬年裡被炸到,我們炸到被炸死了很多人。我捱了七個,命大減回來了。就告訴你們不要過來,千萬不要過來。 王振甲母义勤那个老赵挂了,都不瞑目。赵瑞对周志强说过,他的遗愿是戴一缕头发给他的父母,算是魂归故里。但是战场上没有剪头,周志强只带回了他的证件。赵瑞,38岁,未婚,重庆人。 这是他人生最后阶段录的视频奉劝大家想要过来的跟我私信的不要来没有什么好来的你在国内找个工作好多干也能挣那么多我都很久没有吃到家乡的那些菜了我都很想吃我都很想回去了 想起来,我还想吃点,怎么说呢,我在前面的时候,我就一直想吃的。我在想,哎呀,这个东西该放多少调料,最合适该炒多久。 Zhao Rui is the first Chinese citizen to be confirmed dead on the Russian battlefield. The number of Chinese soldiers injured is not yet reliable. Macaron's estimate is that half of the hundreds of people died and half were injured. Every day. This is where you want to come There are four people who died It was announced by Macaron August 1, 2024 The 20-year-old Liu Jie and his friend Liu Hongwei On the first day of the battlefield Because of the mines and bombs, they were both killed They claimed to be Macaron's fans - Did you wake up? - Oh! 爆炸把腿炸伤了之后对面的这个投弹机五个弹人没了那么另外一个小个子刘洁是两个FQA没了我希望在这如果说有认识他们的这个家人 Please contact me, I will try to communicate with the Russian people here. At least, at least, tell my family. They watched your video when they were in China. Maybe to some extent, it also inspired them or encouraged them to come here. It's a factor. You know when they die, you will be a ghost in your heart. 我認為確實是對他們會有一定的這種誤導當時我把這兩個人的事給爆料出來之後抖音就直接就給我封號了那是因為什麼呢有可能是不想讓更多的人知道有其他的中國人在這陣亡了陣亡者就此消失他們的家庭有沒有拿到俄羅斯承諾的500萬盧布也就是不到40萬人民幣的腐蟀金馬卡龍不清楚 沒有人聯繫他 网上曾经有凤凰卫视记者卢雨光写给普京的信,说到赵瑞的父母,在儿子死亡一个月之后,没有接到任何消息,遗体还残留前线。他希望普京在百忙之中责成处理好此事,让死者有一个人道的安息之地。 正亡者的遗体是如何处理的马卡龙曾经参与过具体工作但是他不愿意多谈有的人也没有读到这个抚恤经我觉得是这样因为很多俄罗斯人都找不到尸体他不就是按照失踪来去定义吗这个东西很混乱战争确实很混乱如果你是在为你的祖国而战或者你可能会被祭祝对吧你会是一个烈士我知道对 在这里就是默默无闻像一只苍蝇一样,我知道,从精神上,从价值观上来讲,没有任何的。所以我说我没有立场,我只是一个普通人,错误的一个选择让我加入到战争囊里。我認為我的角色就是一個大頭兵或者說一個炮灰比較貼切一點 I saw in the video the process of Russian soldiers surrender to the Ukrainian drones. I once asked Makarov why he didn't surrender to the Ukrainians directly on the battlefield and go home.因为我不是俄罗斯人很简单你要俄罗斯人对吧有些人是动员的就跟乌克兰人一样他是必须要上战场的 even the people who were on the battlefield in the past. They can understand each other. For us, foreign soldiers, why do you come here? Isn't it for making money? They might understand. For killing people. In fact, hostility will be greater. He believes that unless the war is over, otherwise, the Ukrainians will not let him go. And the Russians will not let him go. He just doesn't want you to leave this place alive. Macron said his only hope is a ceasefire. And the current international situation is turbulent. The negotiations on the ceasefire are very tough. The second day of the interview, he told me that the assault team had finally been separated and the weapons were put down. How do the Russian army view the current situation? They think the war is coming to an end. They don't want to fight. They want to go home. To be honest, they are tired of the war. What is it? Because those who have experienced the war don't want to experience the war. They don't want to go home. 誇大這些東西 我認為是這樣就是你像在網上鼓吹戰爭打造自己這種英雄形象的人我認為這種人是比較可惡因為就是我認為在戰爭當中沒有英雄每一個人都是壞人因為你不得不去殺人你說的這些人當中有包括你自己嗎 我認為我也是其中之一,我做了一個錯誤的決定,然後錯誤的加入到這場斯拉夫人的戰爭當中,每一寸土地都是靠用鮮血去拿下來的,我覺得其實一點都不貴。 一点都不酷,一点也不好玩,没有人性,没有道德,尤其是一些士兵被俘虏之后,他可能会被侮辱,可能会被虐杀。就是这些行为我认为真的违背了人的这个底线和道德,确实不太好。在这个节目播出之前,我收到马卡龙的信息,他说在运送伤员的路上遇到了轰炸,他四肢都受了伤,现在撤到了后方的医院里面。 But I heard the little laughter from his voice. He said this is the best ending he could imagine in this war. Will you still participate in the future wars after this war? I still hope that if the war is over, I can help others more, not hurt others. Isn't there enough harm done by others here? Or is there not enough harm done by us hurting others? I think so. 所以这句话里面其实我也觉得虽然你阻止自己去感受或者有软弱的情绪但是也许你也有某种伤害他人的愧疚我认为是这样虽然说我们经常这个试图安慰或者说是欺骗自己这就是战争 这就是战争但是我们必须要面对现实在整个的这一年多的战争和经历当中 最讓你感覺到這種不安或者愧疚的就是經常看到這種因為我們有的時候尤其像現在在巴克姆特經常去一些民房裡面它有一些東西有一些這個家具一些什麼東西我們這邊指揮所可能能用得到所以覺得你屬於這種行為其實也不是太好就收集人家的東西雖然說是不要的但是這確實是普通烏克蘭普通老百姓的財產 I think we destroy it or take it away and turn it into a friend. In fact, this feeling is sometimes not good. Macarons were filmed in the middle of the ice. One of them was in the ruins of a family. He and his teammates opened a piano full of dust. I'll tell you the truth. Sometimes I would also look around the abandoned house in the old one. I'm actually quite emotional. I think sometimes I also apologize to the owners and people in my heart. I think so. I regret my actions. Although it's not my fault, it was like this before I came here. But this is indeed the result of our system, our camp, which caused them to be like this. Because I am also a part of this camp. You said you don't want to hurt others in the future, but to help others. For example, what kind of thing? 比如说在敦巴斯地区有很多儿童,我以前在敦涅斯克火车站看到很多儿童起草将来如果有机会的话,我说帮助一下这里的儿童吧,哪怕是文保问题,那也是种帮助吧在这一步骤之前,马卡龙英商无法行走,他撤离前线,去了医院两个月之后,他的合同就要倒期 At night, because Teng Tong could not fall asleep, he wrote only to punish me. I like the feeling of pain. He reminded me that I was still alive. The tree was blown up and there were small branches of the tree. The house was blown up. The engineers would rebuild it. Only the dead people, the four branches that were broken, could never come back. The dead saw the living die. The living hoped the dead could live. I was in Bahamut, a city destroyed by war.
