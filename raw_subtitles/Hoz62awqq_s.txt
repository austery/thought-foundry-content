[Music]


Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.
 We


are
 live.
 It
 is
 Friday,
 December
 5th.


It's
 been
 a
 long
 week,
 but
 it's
 also


been
 a
 very
 fast
 week.
 And
 the
 first


week
 of
 December
 trading
 is
 going
 to
 be


ending
 today
 as
 we
 get
 into
 the
 market


open.
 We
 got
 a
 bunch
 of
 headlines
 this


morning.
 Number
 one
 is
 PCE
 uh
 for


September,
 which
 is
 the
 Fed's
 preferred


measure
 of
 inflation,
 usually
 is
 out
 at


8:30
 a.m.
 on
 the
 days
 that
 PCE
 is


supposed
 to
 come
 out.
 The
 government
 was


shut
 down
 during
 September.
 So,
 it's


coming
 out
 at
 10:00
 a.m.
 today.
 So,
 uh,


in
 about
 an
 hour,
 we're
 going
 to
 get


some
 details
 on
 what
 the
 PCE
 for


September
 looks
 like.
 I
 don't
 know
 how


much
 of
 an
 impact
 it's
 going
 to
 have
 in


terms
 of
 how
 the
 market's
 thinking
 of


inflation.
 Usually
 PCE
 does
 have
 an


impact,
 but
 this
 is
 three
 months
 old


data.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see
 if


the
 market
 does
 react
 to
 that
 react
 to


that
 when
 it
 comes
 out
 at
 10
 a.m.
 The


Fed
 futures
 probabilities
 right
 now
 is


87.2.
 It
 was
 89
 yesterday.
 So,
 uh,
 that


is
 an
 important
 piece
 of
 data
 and
 we'll


see
 what
 happens
 when
 that
 comes
 out.


The
 other
 big
 headline
 obviously
 Netflix


buying
 Warner
 Brothers
 Discovery
 for
 $72


billion.


Uh
 we've
 been
 talking
 about
 this
 all


week.
 It
 is
 definitely
 caught
 my


attention
 uh
 if
 Netflix
 were
 to
 be
 able


to
 acquire
 them.
 Actually,
 it's
 82.7


billion
 equity
 value
 of
 72
 billion.
 Uh


there's
 a
 lot
 to
 break
 down
 and
 dive


into
 and
 see
 kind
 of
 what
 this
 means
 for


the
 overall
 streaming
 landscape.
 Uh,
 I


know
 Netflix
 stock
 is
 down
 in
 the


pre-markets
 because
 obviously
 if
 you're


going
 to
 be
 spending
 $80
 billion,


Street's
 not
 going to
 be
 the
 happiest


about
 it,
 but
 um,


I'm
 not
 buying
 the
 dip
 yet.
 I
 need
 to


analyze
 the
 debt
 profile,
 how
 I
 think


Netflix
 is
 going
 to
 navigate
 the
 debt.


If
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 get
 that
 deep
 into


the
 details
 and
 you
 just
 think
 Netflix


is
 going to
 be
 monopoly,
 I
 mean,
 maybe


this
 is
 a
 buy.
 The
 other
 problem
 is
 the


the
 regulatory
 hurdle
 that
 I
 think


Netflix
 might
 face.
 Now,
 granted,
 I


don't
 think
 they
 did
 this
 deal
 if
 they


didn't
 think
 they
 would
 be
 able
 to
 get


the
 job
 done.
 there's
 some
 unique
 ways


that
 they
 um
 basically
 argued
 that
 they


would
 not
 have
 a
 monopoly
 because
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 internet,
 YouTube
 has
 more


watch
 time
 than
 Netflix.
 So
 like
 their


argument
 is,
 hey,
 we're
 not
 competing


with
 the
 streamers,
 we're
 competing
 with


like
 the
 tech
 companies
 like
 YouTube
 and


Google
 that
 have
 this
 like
 massive


massive
 audience
 online
 or
 Twitch
 with


Amazon.
 So
 I
 think
 there's
 some
 nuance


to
 how
 you
 make
 the
 competition


argument,
 but
 my
 gut
 feeling
 tells
 me


this
 is
 good
 for
 Netflix.
 like
 and
 and


we we'll
 talk
 a
 lot
 more
 about
 it
 in
 a


bit,
 but
 I
 I
 really
 do
 think
 the
 types


of
 content
 they're
 getting
 and
 the
 IP


that
 they
 will
 have
 forever
 on
 that


platform
 in
 and
 and
 in
 the
 subscriber


editions,
 which
 they
 should
 be
 adding
 40


50
 million
 subscribers,
 should
 be
 a
 big


deal.
 So,
 uh
 that
 is
 a
 headline
 that
 we


will
 talk
 about
 and
 get
 into.
 It
 seems


like
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 relatively


important.
 We
 have
 some
 Nvidia
 chip


headlines
 as
 well
 that
 we'll
 get
 into.


Speaking
 of
 Nvidia,
 last
 night
 the
 event


that
 I
 was
 at
 because
 I
 was
 not
 on
 the


market
 close
 was
 an
 event
 for
 Pounder.


Uh
 it
 was
 their
 Paragon
 event.
 This
 is


kind
 of
 like
 AIPCON
 but
 a
 smaller


version
 of
 it.
 It's
 a
 customer
 oriented


event
 where
 uh
 the
 customers
 come,
 they


explain
 what
 they're
 doing
 and
 this
 one


had
 less
 customers
 than
 AIPcon.
 It's


kind
 of like
 all
 also
 like
 an
 end
 of


year
 celebration
 type
 of
 party
 that
 they


do
 in
 December.
 And
 uh
 so
 you
 had
 Mr.


Alex
 Karp
 there
 and
 he
 gave
 a
 small


speech
 and
 then
 you
 had
 some
 customer


presentations.
 The
 reason
 I
 went
 as
 well


is
 to
 do
 some
 interviews
 with
 some


customers
 and
 I
 got
 to
 interview


the


head
 of
 the
 Nvidia
 deal
 along
 with
 the


head
 of
 the
 Palunteer
 Nvidia


collaboration.
 So
 the
 two
 people
 that


were
 integral
 to
 setting
 up
 the
 Nvidia


Palunteer
 collaboration
 um
 I
 I
 got
 to


interview
 them
 and
 that
 video
 will
 come


out
 next
 week.
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 to
 say
 about


the
 Nvidia
 person
 that
 I
 met.
 Basically


Jensen
 has
 30
 direct
 reports.
 I
 met
 one


of
 them
 last
 night
 and
 we
 talked
 for


like
 30
 minutes
 and
 he's
 like
 tight
 with


Jensen
 like
 like
 every
 single
 day
 he's


talking
 to
 Jensen
 and
 it
 was
 really
 cool


to
 pick
 his
 brain
 about
 Jensen
 and
 like


just
 how
 Jensen
 is
 navigating
 this
 whole


you
 know
 four
 and
 a
 half
 trillion
 dollar


company
 thing.
 So
 we'll
 talk
 more
 about


that
 but
 he
 was
 an
 awesome
 guy.
 His
 name


was
 Justin.
 Interview
 will
 be
 out
 with


him
 next
 week
 and
 that's
 why
 uh
 that's


why
 I
 was
 gone
 for
 the
 market
 close


yesterday.
 So
 we'll
 talk
 all
 about
 that


and
 go
 deeper
 into
 it.
 Markets
 are
 red


in
 the
 pre.
 Not
 sure
 why
 we
 were
 green


like
 30
 minutes
 ago.
 Little
 bit
 of
 a


drop.
 Nothing
 crazy.
 S&P
 down
 0.09%.
 It


also
 is
 a
 Friday.
 You've
 got
 options


expiring
 first
 Friday
 of
 December.
 So


you
 might
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 wonky


option
 expiration
 stuff
 that
 happens.


Nvidia
 right
 there
 down
 about1%.


Overall
 the
 week
 has
 been
 green.
 I
 mean


S&P
 684,
 remember
 alltime
 high
 689.
 We


are
 very
 close
 to
 that
 alltime
 high.
 So


if
 we
 can
 even
 hold
 the
 680
 level
 going


into
 next
 week
 for
 December,
 I
 think


that
 would
 be
 good.
 Yeah,
 PCE
 is
 going


to
 be
 at
 10
 a.m.
 Oh,
 Algo
 thought
 PCE


was
 coming.
 Well,
 see,
 I
 saw
 a


screenshot.
 This
 is
 from
 yesterday.


Someone
 posted
 this.
 Uh,
 this
 was
 12


hours
 ago.
 They
 posted
 this
 that
 PCE
 was


coming
 at
 10.
 So,
 I
 feel
 like
 the
 market


has
 had
 12
 hours
 to
 know
 that
 PCE
 is
 not


going to
 be
 coming
 out
 at
 the
 usual
 time


it
 comes
 out.
 But,
 yeah,
 maybe
 the
 delay


is
 causing
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 pain
 there.


And
 so,
 we'll
 see
 when
 that
 uh
 when
 that


one
 comes
 out.


All
 right,
 so
 10
 a.m.
 we'll
 see
 what
 we


get
 with
 PC
 and
 then
 we
 will
 keep
 going


from
 there.
 Again,
 thank
 you
 everybody


for
 being
 here.
 Let's
 get
 into
 it.
 I


think
 let's
 start
 off
 with
 Netflix.


Let's
 start
 off
 with
 Netflix.
 This
 is
 a


big
 one
 and
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 probably


aren't
 investors
 in
 Netflix
 or
 Warner


Brothers,
 but
 man,
 we
 have
 not
 seen
 an


acquisition
 of
 this
 size
 in
 a
 very,


very,
 very
 long
 time.
 And
 it
 is


officially
 happening
 here
 today.
 Yes,


the
 Mexico
 president
 is
 also
 meeting


Trump
 and
 Carney
 in
 DC.
 So,
 the
 Canadian


prime
 minister
 will
 be
 with
 Trump
 and


the
 Mexico
 president.
 Oh,
 the
 the
 SoFi


dilution
 thing.
 Look,
 I
 looked
 at
 it


last
 night.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 that
 big


of
 a
 deal.
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


pissed
 off
 because
 of
 uh
 what
 SoFi
 is


doing
 with
 it.
 Look,
 it
 is
 a
 little
 bit


weird
 timing,
 especially
 before
 the


holidays.
 People
 are
 kind
 of
 upset,
 but


like
 stock's
 down
 5%.
 Stock
 was
 where
 it


was
 at
 last
 week.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


that
 big
 of
 a
 deal.
 I
 am
 trusting
 I'll


just
 talk
 about
 SoFi
 real
 quickly
 before


we
 get into
 Netflix.
 I
 am
 trusting
 Well,


okay.
 So
 is
 now
 7%.
 I
 would
 trust
 that


management
 understands
 why
 they're


diluting.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 this


theory
 that,
 oh,
 they
 should
 have
 waited


until
 after
 the
 S&P
 500
 because
 then


they
 would
 have
 got
 a
 better
 price.
 They


would
 have
 had
 less
 dilution
 to
 raise


the
 same
 amount
 of
 capital.
 It
 was
 about


1.5
 billion.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 uh
 know
 and


I
 don't
 think
 SoFi
 knows
 if
 they're


definitely
 going
 to
 get
 into
 the
 S&P,


which
 I'll
 be
 live
 today.
 The
 S&P


announcement
 is
 at
 5:15
 p.m.
 Eastern.


So,
 I
 think
 Steve
 will
 join
 me
 and
 we'll


we'll
 wait
 and
 see
 if
 SoFi
 ends
 up


getting
 announced.
 But
 I
 don't
 think


this
 was
 contingent
 on
 the
 S&P


announcement.
 I
 think
 they
 just
 really


needed
 the
 money
 to
 do
 something.
 What


are
 they
 doing?
 I
 don't
 know.
 One
 would


argue
 it
 has
 to
 be
 an
 acquisition,
 but
 a


lot
 of
 people
 are
 saying
 it's
 not
 an


acquisition.
 So,
 is
 it
 paying
 off
 some


of the
 convertible
 notes?
 Maybe.
 Um,
 it


is
 a
 bit
 weird
 because
 at
 the
 fireside


chat,
 they
 said
 they
 didn't
 really
 need


capital.
 The
 day
 of
 earnings
 80
 days


ago,
 they
 said
 they
 didn't
 need any


capital
 and
 then,
 you
 know,
 after
 hours


they
 they
 diluted.
 So,
 yeah,
 it's
 weird.


But
 this
 is
 where
 you've
 got
 to
 trust


that
 not
 actually
 knows
 what
 he's
 doing.


Not
 not
 to
 mention
 Noto
 has
 a
 lot
 of


money
 that's
 waiting
 for
 him
 at
 $45
 and


uh
 and
 even
 at
 $35.
 So
 the
 dilution


stops
 the
 stock
 theoretically
 from


easily
 getting
 to
 those
 tanches.
 He
 only


has
 a
 couple
 months
 left
 to
 really


sustain
 those
 uh
 price
 targets
 to
 be


able
 to
 get
 I
 think it's
 like
 $500


million
 he
 would
 unlock.
 So
 I
 I
 would


imagine
 he
 thinks
 this
 thing
 that


they're
 going to
 do
 with
 the
 1.5
 billion


is
 a
 creative
 they
 know
 better
 than
 me,


but
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 that
 big
 of
 a


deal.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 that
 big.


Like
 I
 wouldn't
 freak
 out
 if
 I'm
 heavy


into
 SoFi.
 Um
 is
 it
 annoying
 for
 SoFi


investors?
 Yes.
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 this


is
 the
 second
 time
 they've
 done
 the
 last


dilution
 was
 what
 1.2
 or
 999
 million


something
 like
 that.
 This
 one
 is
 1.5.
 It


is
 kind
 of
 weird
 to
 raise
 that
 much


money
 in
 the
 span
 of
 five
 months.
 And


they
 haven't
 announced
 a
 major


acquisition
 yet.
 So,
 I
 am
 personally


confused
 why
 they're
 doing
 it.
 Do
 I


think
 it's
 the
 end
 of
 SoFi?
 No,
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 the
 end
 of the
 world
 or


anything
 like
 crazy
 like
 that.
 But
 I
 can


understand
 why
 people
 are
 annoyed
 and
 I


get
 it.
 I
 I
 wouldn't
 be
 buying
 the
 dip


though.
 I
 mean
 like
 I
 for
 a
 dip
 by
 this


thing
 was
 at
 23
 two
 weeks
 ago.
 So
 like


for
 a
 dip
 by
 this
 thing
 needs
 to
 get


down
 a
 lot
 more
 to
 get
 more
 excited.
 Now


if
 you
 think
 they're
 going to
 get
 into


the
 S&P
 or
 something
 then
 maybe
 you
 take


a
 swing
 at
 it.
 But
 yeah,
 the
 only


analysis
 I
 can
 really
 provide
 here


because
 no
 one
 knows
 what
 the
 hell


they're
 doing
 this
 for
 is
 that
 you've


got
 to
 trust
 that
 management
 has
 an
 idea


of
 how
 the
 dilution
 is
 going
 to
 play
 out


and
 why
 they
 wanted
 to
 do
 it


specifically
 at
 these
 prices.
 Also,


Goldman
 is
 underwriting
 it
 and
 you
 know


not
 ties
 to
 Goldman.
 So,
 I
 would
 imagine


he
 wanted
 an
 underwriter
 that
 could


effectively
 do
 this
 capital
 raise
 to
 to


get
 to
 the
 next
 step
 of
 what
 they
 want


to
 do.
 But,
 you
 know,
 SoFi
 is
 in
 the


midst
 of
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 do


they
 gain
 massive
 operating
 leverage
 in


the
 business?
 How
 do
 they
 actually
 use


that
 operating
 leverage
 to
 turn
 into


shareholder
 returns?
 The
 shock
 has


already
 done
 very
 well
 this
 year.
 And


then
 how
 can
 this
 dilution
 be
 creative?


And
 we're
 going to
 see
 if
 this
 dilution


ends
 up
 actually
 doing
 something


meaningful.
 I
 guess
 the
 only
 other
 bare


case
 is
 that
 yeah,
 they
 have
 some
 bad


loans
 and
 they
 have
 a
 lot
 more


delinquencies
 than
 expected,
 so
 they


need
 to
 raise
 more
 cap.
 I
 really
 doubt


it
 given
 SoFi's
 underwriting
 quality,


but
 I
 guess
 we're
 going
 to
 find
 out
 over


the
 uh
 over
 the
 coming
 months
 why
 they


ended
 up
 doing
 this
 dilution.
 Okay,


Netflix,
 what
 is
 going
 on
 here?
 So,


here's
 a
 quote
 from
 uh
 Ted
 Sandrano,
 CEO


of
 Netflix.
 Our
 mission
 has
 always
 been


to
 entertain
 the
 world
 by
 combining


Warner
 Bros.
 incredible
 library
 of
 shows


and
 movies
 from
 timeless
 classics
 like


Casablanca
 and
 Citizen
 Kane.
 By
 the
 way,


both
 incredible
 movies.
 If
 you
 haven't


watched
 Casablanca
 or
 Citizen
 Kane,
 what


are
 you
 doing?
 To
 modern
 favorites
 like


Harry
 Potter
 and
 Friends
 with
 our


culture
 defining
 titles
 like
 Stranger


Things,
 K-pop,
 Demon
 Hunters,
 and
 Squid


Game,
 we'll
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that
 even


better.
 Together,
 we
 can
 give
 audiences


more
 of
 what
 they
 love
 and
 help
 define


the
 next
 century
 of
 storytelling.
 Uh
 he


goes
 on
 to
 continue,
 "The
 acquisition


will
 improve
 our
 offering
 and
 accelerate


our
 business
 for
 decades
 to
 come."
 And
 I


think
 they're
 right.
 Like
 for
 the
 next


decades,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 content


library
 that
 is
 very
 rich
 for
 Netflix.


Warner
 Bros.
 has
 defined
 entertainment


for
 more
 than
 a
 century
 and
 continues
 to


do
 so
 with
 phenomenal
 creative


executives
 and
 production
 capabilities.


With
 a
 global
 reach
 and
 proven
 business


model,
 we
 can
 introduce
 a
 broader


audience
 to
 the
 worlds
 they
 create,


giving
 our
 members
 more
 options,


attracting
 more
 fans
 to
 our


best-in-class
 streaming
 service,
 and


strengthening
 the
 entire
 industry
 for


entertainment
 and
 creating
 more
 value


for
 shareholders.


I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 good
 deal,
 man.
 Like
 I


the
 one
 of the
 reasons
 I
 subscribed
 to


HBO
 Max
 a
 while
 ago
 was
 just
 because


they
 have
 way
 better
 intellectual


property
 than
 Netflix.
 You
 have
 all
 the


DC
 movies
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 Batman.
 I'll


finally
 be
 able
 to
 watch
 The
 Dark
 Knight


whenever
 I
 want
 on
 Netflix.
 Uh
 Friends,


that
 in
 of
 itself
 is
 massive.
 All
 the


Harry
 Potter,
 that's
 massive.
 Got


Silicon
 Valley,
 Big
 Bang
 Theory.
 I
 mean,


just
 so
 many
 classic
 shows
 that
 people


love
 are
 now
 going
 to
 Netflix.
 The
 the


question
 is
 the
 unit
 economics
 on
 this


deal.
 The
 bare
 case
 to
 this
 is
 Netflix


gave
 an
 allcash
 offer
 last
 night
 and


they
 upped
 it
 from
 whatever
 Paramount


Paramount
 offered
 and
 they
 said
 we'll
 do


or
 it's
 about
 85%
 of
 its
 cash
 and
 like


it's
 $23
 cash
 per
 uh
 WBD
 stock
 and
 then


um
 $4
 a
 share
 of
 Netflix
 stock.
 Now


Warner
 Brothers
 is
 not
 necessarily


pumping.
 It's
 up
 3%
 but
 it's
 not
 at
 the


acquisition
 price
 because
 I
 think
 a
 lot


of
 people
 are
 still
 wondering
 will
 this


go
 through?
 So
 there
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 of


an
 arbitrage
 there.
 the
 the
 uh
 bare
 case


here
 is
 that
 Netflix
 got
 one
 could
 argue


Netflix
 became
 desperate
 to
 offer
 this


much
 money
 and
 the
 reason
 they
 might
 be


becoming
 desperate
 Netflix
 right
 here


down
 3.5%
 is
 because
 their
 actual


business
 on
 an
 advertising
 and


subscriber
 side
 is
 slowing
 remember
 they


don't
 report
 subscribers
 anymore
 and


they
 are
 realizing
 that
 there's
 not
 that


many
 K-pop
 demon
 hunters
 and
 Squid
 Games


for
 them
 to
 be
 able
 to
 create
 over
 the


next
 five
 years
 to
 meaningfully
 get
 that


next
 surge
 of
 subscribers,
 which


inevitably
 means
 they're
 not
 going
 to


get
 that
 next
 surge
 of
 revenue.
 And


Netflix
 trades
 at
 a
 multiple
 that
 quite


frankly,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 the
 rest
 of
 the


media
 entertainment
 business
 cannot


believe.
 And
 I
 I
 I
 missed
 Netflix
 for


the
 past
 10
 years
 because
 I
 couldn't


believe
 why
 they
 trade
 at
 this
 multiple


because
 I
 was
 like,
 they're
 not
 a
 tech


company.
 They're
 a
 media
 company.
 Like,


yes,
 they
 use
 algorithms
 to
 help
 you


recommend
 what
 content
 you
 want,
 but


they're
 but
 they
 have
 to
 buy
 the
 content


to
 be able
 to
 get
 it
 on
 the
 platform.


So,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 cogs
 there
 just
 in


order
 to
 make
 it
 happen.
 But
 Netflix


trades
 at
 a
 multiple
 and
 I
 think it's


because
 it's
 a
 best-in-class
 streaming


service.
 Question
 is,
 how
 do
 they


protect
 that
 multiple
 going
 into
 the


next
 decade?
 And
 I
 think
 to
 protect
 it,


you
 need
 the
 best.
 But
 you
 you
 have
 to


give
 everyone
 a
 reason
 to
 never
 leave


and
 more
 content
 might
 end
 up
 being
 that


reason.
 So,
 let's
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 more


analysis
 right
 here.
 But
 I
 do
 think
 it's


a
 big
 deal.
 I'm
 not
 buying
 the
 Netflix


dip
 yet,
 but
 I
 am
 heavily
 exploring
 it


because
 if
 this
 thing
 goes
 on
 sale
 and


they
 have
 a
 monopoly
 on
 streaming


essentially,
 it
 does
 feel
 a
 bit
 more


attractive.


>> Um,
 I
 do
 think,
 you
 know,
 I
 don't
 know.


Do
 do
 you
 watch
 Stranger
 Things,
 Andrew?


>> I
 have.
 Yes.


>> You
 know,
 in
 some
 ways
 it
 sort
 of
 feels


like
 we're
 living
 in
 the
 upside
 down.


You
 know,
 you
 think
 about
 how
 this


process
 has
 been
 playing
 out
 and


Paramount
 was
 out
 there
 saying,
 "We're


the
 only
 ones
 that
 can
 buy
 this
 asset.


We
 have
 this
 unique
 relationship
 with


the
 president.
 Nobody
 else
 can
 get


approved."
 And
 they've
 been
 the
 ones


complaining
 that
 the
 process
 is
 not
 fair


or
 quote
 unquote
 rigged.
 That
 seems
 sort


of
 strange
 and
 sort
 of
 feels
 like
 sour


grapes
 now.
 It
 really
 feels
 like


honestly
 it
 feels
 like
 they
 got
 outbid


because
 this
 is
 the
 north
 of
 $30
 bid
 in


total
 when
 you
 think
 about
 the


>> there
 is
 a
 breakup
 fee
 as
 well.
 So
 if


the
 regular
 regulators
 say
 this
 is
 not


possible
 Netflix
 has
 to
 basically
 pay
 $6


billion
 just
 like
 Adobe
 has
 to
 pay
 a


billion
 dollars
 to
 Figma.
 So
 Netflix
 is


taking
 on
 a
 $6
 billion
 risk.
 That's
 not


a
 joke.
 I
 mean,
 so
 someone
 in
 the


Netflix
 seauite
 really
 thinks
 that


they're
 not
 going
 to
 have
 an
 issue
 with


the
 FTC
 to
 get
 this
 done
 because
 I
 mean,


if
 they
 do,
 Warner
 Brothers
 is
 going
 to


get
 a
 free
 $6
 billion.


>> Discovery
 piece.
 This
 is
 the
 $30
 plus


bid
 that,
 you
 know,
 Malone's
 been


talking
 to
 Faber
 about
 and
 that
 we've


heard
 multiple
 times
 from
 Zaz.
 This
 is


that
 type
 of
 huge
 number.
 Look,
 the
 math


is
 going to
 hurt
 Netflix
 for
 a
 while.


There's
 no
 doubt
 this
 is
 an
 expensive.
 I


mean,
 they
 think
 this
 is
 accretive
 in


year
 two.
 Obviously,
 we
 have
 to


understand
 how
 they
 get
 there,
 but
 you


know,
 maybe
 it's
 just
 that
 there's
 so


much
 stuff
 that
 they
 can
 turbocharge,


but
 but
 this
 is
 a
 huge
 price
 and
 I
 don't


see
 how
 Paramount
 can
 can
 top
 this
 bid.


This
 seems
 like
 a
 number
 that
 is
 just


too
 big.


>> How
 you
 we're
 talking
 about
 year
 two.


How
 quickly
 do
 we
 get
 to
 even
 year
 one


given
 the
 regulatory
 review
 and
 and


likely
 fight
 that
 is
 going
 to
 go
 on?
 You


have
 to
 imagine
 given
 all
 of
 the
 noise


we've
 already
 heard
 from
 Paramount
 about


its
 views
 about
 a
 potential
 uh


transaction
 of
 this
 sort
 and
 how
 they


believe
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be


anti-competitive
 that
 they
 will
 be
 out


there
 as
 other
 companies
 might
 be
 going


to
 the
 Justice
 Department
 seeking
 to


block
 this
 deal.


>> Look,
 I'm
 sure
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 lots


of,
 you
 know,
 attacks
 on
 this
 and


there's
 no
 doubt
 this
 is
 not
 a
 quick
 to


close.
 You
 know,
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 the


math
 last
 night,
 Andrew.
 And
 if
 you
 look


at,
 you
 know,
 let's
 just
 say
 for
 a


second,
 the
 market
 is
 only
 streaming,


professional
 streaming.
 So,
 we're
 going


to
 exclude
 YouTube.
 We're
 going
 to


exclude
 all
 of
 linear
 TV.
 Now,
 both
 of


those
 in
 2025,
 both
 of
 those,
 it's
 to


exclude
 those.
 That
 sounds
 sort
 of


insane,
 but
 if
 you
 just
 looked
 at


streaming
 today,
 XY
 YouTube,
 Netflix


represents
 24%
 of
 TV
 time
 spent.
 with


HBO
 Max
 that
 24
 goes
 to
 28.
 So
 it's
 not


like
 you're
 going
 from
 24
 to
 50
 or
 from


50
 to
 75.
 Like
 you're
 still
 in
 that


quarter
 of
 the
 industry,
 you
 know,
 when


you
 look
 at
 it
 like
 that.
 And
 if
 you
 put


it
 into
 the
 larger
 context
 of
 with


YouTube,
 with
 ABC
 and
 ESPN
 and
 all
 the


channels
 that
 they're
 really
 competing


with
 on
 a
 TV
 for
 time
 spent,
 Netflix


plus
 HBO
 is
 still
 under
 10%
 smaller
 than


YouTube,
 smaller
 than
 Disney,
 actually


when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 entire
 Walt
 Disney


company.
 And
 so
 it
 all
 depends
 on
 how


you
 define
 the
 market
 for
 sure.
 And
 I
 I


I
 know
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 tremendous


amount
 of
 attacks
 on
 this.
 It
 is


interesting
 though.
 You
 would
 think


movie
 theaters
 are
 one
 of the
 ones
 that


are
 going
 to
 be
 the
 most
 aggressive
 in


trying
 to
 attack
 this.
 But
 look
 at
 what


just
 happened
 in
 the
 last
 few
 weeks.


Adam
 Aaron,
 who
 has
 hated
 Netflix,
 came


out
 and
 was
 gushing
 about
 Netflix
 and


their
 new
 relationship
 and
 new


partnership
 with
 with
 Netflix
 and
 how


they're
 going
 to
 play
 Stranger
 Things
 in


movie
 theaters,
 I
 believe
 on
 New
 Year's


Eve,
 a
 special
 presentation.
 And
 so,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 Netflix
 has
 done
 an


incredible
 job
 of
 sort
 of
 bringing,
 you


know,
 getting
 the
 industry
 behind
 them


over
 the
 course
 of
 the
 last
 year
 and


it's
 gonna
 make
 it
 that
 much
 harder
 to


fight
 this.


>> Rich,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 do
 long
 form.


Andrew
 likes
 long
 form.
 I
 I
 don't
 know


why.
 Maybe
 Faber
 should
 because
 he's


been
 more
 involved
 with
 Time
 Warner
 crap


over
 the
 years
 than
 than
 any
 all
 the
 way


back
 to
 Jerry
 Levvin
 and
 and
 everything


else.
 I'm
 just
 thinking
 about
 all
 the


stops
 and
 starts
 along
 the
 way
 for
 these


these
 unbelievably
 venerable


uh
 assets
 and
 I'm
 just
 going
 back
 AT&T


wanted
 them
 more
 than
 anything
 in
 the


world
 till
 they
 got
 them
 and
 then
 it's


like
 what
 are
 we
 going
 to
 do
 with
 them


and
 then
 David
 wanted
 them
 Zazov
 wanted


them
 more
 than
 anything
 in
 the
 world
 and


then
 he
 got
 them
 and
 it
 ended
 up
 kind
 of


being
 a
 cleanup
 of
 of
 of
 sorts.
 Do
 we


say
 David


when
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 the
 legacy


that
 this
 is
 amazing
 that
 he's
 able
 to


get
 $30
 finally
 because
 a
 couple
 of


years
 ago
 I
 think
 he
 would
 have
 thought


that
 that
 that
 would
 not
 have
 been


great.
 But
 you
 look
 at
 the
 entire
 media


landscape
 what
 Sherry
 Redstone
 ended
 up


with.
 You
 Comcast
 is
 at
 $27
 down
 from


$65.
 The
 the
 the
 land


>> Disney's
 lower
 than
 a
 decade
 ago,
 Joe.


>> Disney's
 lower
 than
 a
 decade.
 It's
 at
 at


a
 $100
 a
 share.
 So,
 what
 do
 we
 say
 about


he
 got
 $30?
 Do
 we
 say
 it's
 a
 huge


triumph
 and
 it
 that
 he
 bought
 it
 and


it's
 amazing
 or
 do
 we
 say,
 you
 know,


it's
 just
 sort
 of
 the
 best
 you
 could
 do


given
 the
 the
 circumstances?
 How
 do
 you


how
 do
 you
 character?


>> Look,


>> you're
 asking
 me.


>> I'm
 asking
 you.


>> Oh,
 sorry,
 Rich.
 I'm
 being
 asked


contextually
 contextually
 in
 this


moment.


>> It's
 a
 great


>> It's
 a
 You
 have
 to
 give
 him
 a
 lot
 of


credit
 for
 getting
 to
 this
 place.


>> Okay.
 But


>> look,
 I
 think


he
 does
 deserve
 a
 lot
 of
 credit
 because


he's
 been
 thrown
 around
 Warner
 Brothers


many,
 many
 times
 in
 many
 different


directions.
 The
 question
 is,
 is
 this


accretive
 to
 Netflix?
 I
 mean,
 honestly,


no
 one
 even
 cares
 about
 the
 impact
 of


Warner
 Brothers
 anymore.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is


a
 legacy
 media
 company.
 Cable
 networks


are
 not
 surviving.
 TNT,
 TBS,
 no
 one


really
 watches
 those
 anymore.
 What


matters
 is
 where
 this
 goes
 from
 a


streaming
 perspective.
 And
 we're
 gonna


have
 to
 see
 how
 aggregative
 this
 ends
 up


becoming
 for
 Netflix.
 Again,
 my
 gut


reaction,
 and
 Steve
 will
 talk
 about
 it


later
 as
 well
 on
 the
 show
 on
 the
 close,


um,
 is
 that
 it's
 bullish,
 but
 there
 is
 a


lot
 of
 debt
 that
 Netflix
 is
 bringing


onto
 their
 balance
 sheet.
 And
 the
 debt's


not
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal,
 but
 it's
 also


like
 that
 is
 something
 that's
 going
 to


start,
 you
 know,
 navigable
 that
 Netflix


gets
 has
 never
 been
 a
 multiple
 with
 that


much
 debt.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to


potentially
 affect
 shareholder
 equity.


like
 we
 really
 have
 to
 talk
 about
 what


this
 means
 for
 the
 liabilities
 they
 have


and
 you
 know
 how
 fast
 they
 can
 outgrow


that.
 So,
 we'll
 try
 to
 do
 some
 more


analysis
 there.
 I
 I
 think
 we
 also
 have


to
 get
 the
 exact
 HBO
 max
 subscriber


number
 because
 then
 we
 can
 sort
 of


calculate
 how
 much
 revenue
 Netflix
 is


adding
 for
 paying
 for
 this
 deal
 as
 well.


And
 they're
 estimating
 in
 year
 two


you'll
 see
 accretion
 on
 the
 EPS
 side
 of


things
 and
 you
 know
 if
 that's
 the
 case


that
 is
 a
 way
 for
 Netflix
 to
 grow
 over


the
 coming
 years
 without
 having
 to
 just


produce
 their
 own
 content.
 So
 that's


what
 we
 got
 on
 Netflix.
 That's
 down


about
 3.2%
 so
 still
 down
 7.4.
 I
 am
 very


curious
 to
 see
 if
 SoFi
 after
 the


dilution
 yesterday
 is
 going
 to
 uh


continue
 staying
 at
 these
 levels
 or
 if


this
 dip
 gets
 bought
 up.
 I'll
 put
 a
 poll


in
 the
 chat
 and
 see
 what
 people
 think.


Do
 they
 think
 the
 dip
 gets
 bought
 up?


Again,
 I
 really
 don't
 understand
 why


they
 diluted,
 but
 because
 I
 don't


understand
 it
 and
 quite
 frankly,
 no
 one


else
 understands
 the
 exact
 for.
 You
 got


to
 trust
 the
 management
 has
 some
 idea
 of


where
 the
 dilution
 is
 going
 to
 play
 out.


Um,
 does
 the
 SoFi
 dip
 get
 bought?


And
 you
 also
 got
 to
 trust
 that
 there's


something
 they're
 planning
 to
 do
 to
 make


this
 to
 make
 this
 a
 real
 thing.
 Rubric,


great
 earnings
 yesterday.
 Again,
 I
 was


not
 live
 to
 coverage.
 Shout
 out
 to
 Sam.


I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 name
 that
 he
 pitched


on
 the
 show.
 Wow.
 Up
 20%
 right
 here.


Pitched
 this
 um
 back
 in
 September
 or


early
 October.
 19.95%
 they
 beat
 on
 the


top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 So,
 you
 got
 Rubric


getting
 some
 momentum
 right
 here.
 Uh,


this
 stock
 was
 actually,
 you
 know,
 it


was
 around
 this
 range
 when
 Sam
 pitched


it
 and
 then
 it
 fell
 down
 to
 the
 like
 the


low7s
 and
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 weird
 why
 that


happened,
 but
 they
 ended
 up
 putting
 up


some
 really
 good
 numbers.
 It's
 a
 name
 in


the
 software
 space
 that's
 getting
 a
 lot


more
 attention
 in
 terms
 of
 their


progress.
 Uh,
 Rubric
 right
 here.
 Wow.
 I


didn't
 even
 see
 these
 numbers
 because
 I


was
 out,
 but
 there
 you
 go.
 beat
 by
 159%


profitable
 quarter
 versus
 the
 market


thinking
 they
 were
 not
 going to
 be


profitable.
 That's
 probably
 what
 really


got
 the
 street
 excited
 and
 they
 beat


revenue
 by
 30
 million.


So
 another
 software
 name
 that
 continues


to
 show
 some
 more
 momentum
 which
 is


exciting.
 Abishik
 says
 this
 is
 not
 a
 dip


and
 so
 if
 I
 dip
 was
 when
 it
 was
 up
 24.
 I


agree
 like
 27
 is
 not
 the
 dip.
 Down
 7%
 is


like
 where
 it
 was
 a
 couple
 days
 ago.
 So


it's
 just
 annoying.
 I
 get
 it
 for
 why


people
 are
 upset.


But
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 It
 is
 what
 it
 this


is
 how
 this
 is
 how
 SoFi
 operates.
 I


mean,
 they've
 done
 this
 many
 many
 many


times
 and
 I
 guess
 this
 is
 how
 they're


going
 to
 continue
 to
 finance
 a
 lot
 of


different
 things
 they
 need.
 I
 think
 the


thing
 they
 have
 to
 prove
 that
 the


dilution
 actually
 is
 worth
 something
 for


shareholders
 because
 you
 know
 there's
 no


technis
 acquisition
 or
 Galileo
 like
 they


did
 back
 in
 2020.
 even
 the
 last
 dil


dilutive
 raise,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 people


are
 still
 confused
 why
 exactly
 that


needed
 to
 be
 done
 outside
 of
 the
 the


debt
 refinancing.
 Um,


so
 I
 think
 people
 are
 just
 curious
 like


why
 does
 this
 company
 need
 that
 much


money
 and
 I
 imagine
 not
 will
 get
 more


clarity
 on
 it
 over
 the
 coming
 months.


S&P
 500
 right
 there
 going
 green.
 Amazon


going
 a
 little
 green
 as
 well.
 I
 ran
 down


about
 1.3%
 then
 poundry
 right
 here
 177


in
 the
 pre-markets.
 again,
 we're
 going


to
 get
 um
 the
 data
 for
 PCE
 at
 10:00
 a.m.


and
 we'll
 discuss
 what
 happens
 with


that,
 but
 that
 could
 also
 be
 something


where
 maybe,
 you
 know,
 if
 you're


thinking
 of
 making
 a
 trade
 after
 10
 a.m.


is
 a
 bit
 more
 important
 once
 we
 get
 that


piece
 of
 news
 and
 we'll
 see
 how
 that


impacts
 the
 broader
 market.
 Robin
 Hood,


I
 did
 get
 access
 to
 Robin
 Hood
 banking


yesterday
 and
 let
 me
 just
 say
 this
 is


legit.
 This
 is
 very,
 very
 legit.
 I'll


write
 a
 review
 on
 it
 later
 on
 X
 over
 the


weekend,
 but
 um
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 best


apps
 I've
 ever
 seen.
 It's
 just
 like
 an


it's
 an
 entire
 ecosystem
 of
 your


brokerage,
 credit
 card,
 net
 worth,


sending,
 receiving
 money.
 It's
 just
 it


took
 three
 minutes
 to
 sign,
 less
 than


three
 minutes
 to
 get
 in
 and
 it
 was


really
 cool.
 So,
 I
 think
 they're
 rolling


it
 out
 at
 a
 much
 heavier
 rate.
 It's
 very


very
 very
 bullish
 for
 Robin
 Hood
 going


into
 next
 year
 because
 you
 can
 imagine


you
 know
 they
 have
 27
 billion
 users
 even


if
 five
 to
 seven
 million
 sign
 up
 for


banking
 and
 they
 hook
 up
 direct
 deposit


which
 you
 get
 three
 and
 a
 half%
 um
 APY


if
 you
 do
 direct
 deposit
 it's
 a
 lot
 more


deposits
 coming
 into
 Robin
 Hood
 and
 they


already
 are
 killing
 the
 deposits
 by


getting
 all
 these
 transfer
 bonuses
 to


come
 in.
 They
 have
 a
 natural
 flow
 of


deposits
 based
 on
 people
 that
 can


continue
 contributing
 to
 the
 platform.


Now
 if
 they
 get
 direct
 deposits
 it's
 a


big
 deal.
 It's
 a
 very
 very very
 big


deal.
 So
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 now


getting
 access
 to
 it
 and
 you
 have
 to


sign
 up
 through
 a
 weight.
 So
 I
 got
 a


wait
 list
 offer
 last
 week
 and
 then
 and
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 did
 and
 I
 saw
 a


lot
 of
 screenshots
 yesterday
 of
 people


getting
 accepted.
 So
 I
 think
 it
 should


be
 rolling
 out
 to
 millions
 of
 people
 by


early
 2026.
 Robin
 does
 have
 an
 event
 on


December
 16th
 as
 well.
 So,
 you
 got


banking
 coming
 out.
 You
 have
 the


prediction
 market
 catalyst.
 And
 then
 you


have
 the
 AI
 stuff
 they're
 introducing
 on


December
 16th,
 which
 should
 be
 very,


very
 important
 as
 well.
 Yeah.
 You
 don't


get
 3%
 on
 every
 deposit.
 You
 get
 3.5%


APY
 if
 you
 set
 up
 direct
 deposit.
 So,
 if


you're
 getting
 paid
 from
 your
 employer


to
 your
 Chase
 account,
 if
 you
 switch


that
 to
 Hood,
 you
 know,
 Chase
 is
 giving


you
 0.001%
 or
 whatever
 in
 their


checkings
 account,
 uh,
 Robin
 will
 give


you
 three
 and a
 half%.
 which
 is
 really


cool,
 dude,
 because
 I
 mean
 to
 get
 three


and
 a
 half
 percent
 just
 on
 your
 direct


deposits
 and
 just
 have
 it
 in
 one


ecosystem,
 I
 think
 it's
 very
 enticing


for
 people
 and
 again
 that
 could
 just
 be


another
 way
 that
 deposits
 continue
 to


scale.
 S&P
 right
 there
 68439.
 You
 got


poundry
 at
 177.
 Uh
 Bloom,
 which
 had
 a


great
 day,
 that
 was
 up
 15%.
 Then
 Oak
 Low


was
 up
 15%
 yesterday.
 It's
 down
 4%.
 Now,


here's
 another
 thing
 about
 the
 uh
 high


beta
 names
 that
 are
 in
 that
 sort
 of
 meme


stock
 bucket
 as
 defined
 by
 the
 meme
 ETF.


If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 entire
 bucket
 of


those
 names,
 they're
 up
 9%
 this
 week.


So,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 are
 coming
 back


to
 fruition
 and
 they're
 getting
 some


excitement.
 Now,
 are
 they
 going to
 get


back
 to
 all-time
 highs?
 I
 don't
 know.


BMR,
 by
 the
 way,
 is
 included
 in
 that


bucket.
 BMR
 was
 up
 8%
 yesterday,
 down
 2%


in
 the
 pre-markets,
 but
 you
 are
 seeing
 a


little
 bit
 more
 momentum
 in
 the
 Oaklows


of
 the
 world.
 And
 you
 know,
 obviously


Jensen
 saying
 what
 he
 said
 about
 nuclear


reactors
 the
 other
 day
 on
 the
 Joe
 Rogan


podcast.
 That
 also
 really


really
 did
 help
 the
 the
 nuclear
 stocks,


but
 we're
 gonna
 see
 if
 those
 continue


continue
 to
 go
 green.
 What
 does
 private


banking
 even
 mean?
 I
 think
 it's
 more
 of


a
 branding
 thing.
 It's
 not
 really
 like


private
 banking.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


features
 inside
 of
 Robin's
 banking
 app


that
 theoretically


uh
 wealthy
 people
 have
 had
 access
 to
 for


a
 long
 time
 and
 Robin
 is
 just
 trying
 to


bring
 that
 in,
 give
 it
 to
 more
 people.


So
 I
 think
 private
 banking
 is
 just
 a


name
 for
 it.
 But
 the
 underlying
 argument


is
 just
 a
 really
 good
 experience
 that


has
 a
 lot
 more
 features
 than
 you
 would


expect
 from
 a
 from
 a
 typical
 bank.
 Meta


right
 there
 at
 661.
 So
 Meta
 held
 on
 to


the
 4%
 move
 yesterday
 after
 the
 Zux
 news


that
 he
 was
 cutting
 some
 people
 from
 the


metaverse
 or
 cutting
 some
 essentially


spend
 from
 the
 metaverse
 by
 about
 30%.


So
 the
 fact
 that
 Meta
 kept
 its
 move
 I


think is
 actually
 really
 bullish.
 It


could
 have
 gave
 back
 all
 4%
 of
 the
 move.


Wow.
 Vlad's
 on
 the
 compound.
 This
 popped


up
 just
 now.
 Oh,
 that'll
 be
 a
 fun
 one.


That'll
 be
 a
 fun
 one.
 Look
 at
 that.
 Our


boy
 Vlad
 talking
 with
 Mr.
 Josh
 Brown.


All right,
 that's
 cool.
 So,
 we'll


probably
 get
 some
 good
 content
 and
 some


clips
 out
 of
 that
 later.
 But,
 um,


yeah,
 it
 seems
 like
 the
 Zucks
 news
 was


bullish.
 And
 the
 fact
 that
 Meta
 didn't


give
 it
 back.
 It
 was
 up
 at
 680,
 it's
 at


660,
 but
 that
 was
 pre-market.
 So,
 the


fact
 that
 the
 market's
 actually
 holding


on
 to
 that
 idea
 that
 efficiency
 is


bullish
 for
 the
 stock,
 I
 think
 is
 good.


And
 if
 you're
 a
 meta
 investor,
 that's


important
 to
 kind
 of
 hold
 on
 to
 that


name
 as
 well
 to
 make
 sure
 it
 continues


making
 its
 momentum.
 Uh,
 let's
 listen
 to


our
 boy
 from
 Morgan
 Stanley,
 Mike


Wilson.
 He's
 been
 pretty
 bullish
 this


entire
 rally,
 November,
 and
 let's
 just


get
 his
 broader
 perspective
 on
 where
 he


thinks
 the
 market
 is
 going
 right
 now.


continuation
 of
 this
 year's
 story.
 I


mean,
 you
 know,
 we
 we
 had
 a
 view
 coming


into
 the
 year
 that
 they
 were
 going
 to


probably
 do
 the
 growth
 negative
 policy


stuff
 first
 and
 it
 turned
 into
 sort
 of


kitchen
 sinking
 it
 and
 that
 all
 happened


faster
 and
 more
 dramatically
 than
 even


we
 predicted.
 So
 then
 when
 they
 flipped


the
 switch
 in
 April,
 I
 mean
 now
 we're


looking
 at
 this
 just
 reversion
 of
 all
 of


these
 revisions
 that
 got
 so
 negative
 and


now
 I
 mean
 to
 be
 honest
 I
 mean
 some
 of


the
 stuff
 they've
 done
 has
 been
 even


more
 constructive.
 I
 mean
 the
 big


beautiful
 bill
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 much


bigger
 than
 we
 thought
 from
 a
 capex


incentive
 standpoint.
 there's
 a
 real


benefit
 to
 the
 consumer
 in
 the
 first


half
 of
 next
 year
 in
 terms
 of
 tax
 cuts


and
 tax
 benefits
 from
 the
 salt


deductions
 increasing
 as
 well
 as
 the
 tax


on
 tips
 etc.
 Then
 you
 have
 the
 the
 story


with
 the
 the
 Fed
 now
 kind
 of


turbocharging
 this
 story.
 So
 you've


already
 had
 the
 earnings
 revisions.
 The


Feds
 now
 is
 going
 to
 be
 you
 know


tailwind
 at
 your
 back
 and
 this
 is
 the


broadening
 out
 story
 that
 I've
 kind
 of


referred
 to
 several
 times
 in
 the
 show


already.
 So
 this
 is
 where
 I
 think


investors
 have
 to
 make
 a
 choice.
 There's


a
 fork
 in
 the
 road
 now.
 As
 Yogi
 Yogi


Bear
 would
 say
 take
 it.
 Okay,
 we're


going
 to
 take
 the
 the
 fork
 towards
 the


the
 broadening
 out
 and
 that
 would
 be


areas
 like
 consumer
 discretionary,
 some


of
 the
 financials
 that
 have
 haven't


performed.
 Some
 of
 the
 financials
 have


done
 really
 well,
 but
 there's
 parts
 of


the
 financial
 sector
 that
 haven't
 done


well.
 Transports,
 you
 mentioned
 that,


that's
 an
 area
 that's
 really
 suffered.


Some
 of
 the
 commodity
 patch
 hasn't
 done


particularly
 well.
 Consumer
 goods
 over


services.
 So,
 there
 are
 plenty
 of
 things


in
 the
 market
 that
 have
 not
 worked
 yet


that
 don't
 have
 high
 multiples
 where
 the


earnings
 are
 going
 to
 surprise
 the


upside.
 You
 get
 multiple
 expansion
 and


earnings
 growth.
 So
 you
 see
 the
 benefits


of
 the
 tax
 bill.
 Any
 of
 that
 offset
 by


increased
 premiums
 for
 health
 care
 with


the
 roll
 off
 of
 these
 subsidies
 because


you
 know
 that's
 a
 big
 number
 but
 then


you
 might
 say
 hey
 listen
 that's
 a
 lower


earning
 uh
 you
 know
 consumer
 so
 maybe


it's
 not
 that
 big
 of
 an
 impact
 on
 the


broader
 economy.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 the
 immigration


restriction
 because
 that
 clearly
 was
 a


funnel
 for
 consumer
 spending
 but
 once


again
 lower
 in
 spending.
 So
 it's
 a
 good


trade-off.
 The
 biggest
 beneficiary
 of


the
 of
 the
 bill
 is
 the
 middle
 income


cohort
 and
 they
 have
 a
 high
 propensity


to
 spend
 in
 areas
 that
 we're
 talking


about.


Yeah,
 Mike
 Wilson's
 core
 argument
 has


been
 around
 this
 idea
 that
 this
 K-shaped


economy
 will
 lead
 to
 the
 Fed
 easing


because
 they
 want
 to,
 you
 know,
 protect


against
 rate
 cuts
 and
 or
 protected
 labor


market.
 So,
 you
 know,
 we're
 going to
 get


rate
 cuts
 and
 if
 you
 get
 rate
 cuts,
 that


is
 going to
 be
 conducive
 to
 stocks.
 So,


the
 simple
 argument
 has
 always
 been
 if


the
 Fed
 continues
 to
 ease,
 which
 we're


going
 to
 have
 the
 meeting
 next
 Wednesday


on
 December
 10th,
 so
 I'll
 be
 live
 for


that.
 uh
 yes,
 Wednesday,
 then
 that
 could


be
 bullish
 and
 obviously
 it
 could
 give
 a


lot
 of
 relief
 to
 different
 consumers.


Now,
 PCE
 is
 coming
 out
 at
 uh
 10:00
 a.m.


The
 expectation
 for
 it
 from
 what
 I'm


seeing,
 let's
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here,


is


oh,
 we
 also
 get
 Michigan
 consumer


sentiment
 is
 um
 2%.


So,
 if
 we
 can
 come
 in
 and
 then
 uh


year-over-year
 it's
 2.8%.


If
 we
 can
 come
 in
 below
 2.8
 or
 at
 2.8,


this
 could
 be
 a
 fun
 Friday.
 Now,


granted,


do
 we
 actually
 come
 in,
 you
 know,
 if
 we


come
 in
 at
 three,
 this
 could
 be
 a
 little


bit
 of
 an
 ugly
 Friday.
 Uh
 although
 maybe


the
 market
 brushes
 it
 off.
 So,
 we're


going
 to
 have
 to
 see,
 but
 that
 number
 in


the
 next
 45
 minutes
 definitely
 is


probably
 going
 to
 define
 the
 majority
 of


at
 least
 the
 morning's
 trading
 action.


And
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 when
 we
 get
 that


number
 and
 how
 that
 uh
 how
 that


ultimately
 impacts
 this
 week.
 I
 mean,


this
 week
 has
 been
 a
 relatively
 strong


week.
 You're
 getting
 a
 lot
 of
 stocks
 get


back
 to
 some
 of their
 core
 levels,
 and


they're
 doing
 it
 in
 a
 more
 healthy
 way.


So,
 the
 question
 is
 now,
 can
 we
 sustain


that
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 December?


Cheeky,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


What's
 the
 likelihood
 that
 the
 household


robots
 are
 included
 in
 their
 support
 for


the
 robotics
 industry?
 My
 husband


randomly
 purchased
 IRBT,
 who
 are
 heavily


in
 debt,
 and
 I
 want
 him
 to
 sell
 as
 he's


now
 up
 20%.
 IRBT.


Iroot.
 Oh,
 yeah.
 This
 one.
 Oh,
 wow.
 It's


up
 20%
 in
 the
 pre-markets.


Is
 there
 news
 on
 this?
 This
 there
 was


news
 on
 this
 one
 a
 couple
 of
 days
 ago,


right?
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 had
 a
 lot
 of


time
 to
 cover
 it


because


of
 the
 Nvidia
 headlines
 we
 had.
 I
 don't


know
 much
 about
 IRBT.
 I
 wouldn't
 be
 if


if
 your
 goal
 of
 holding
 on
 to
 this
 is


because
 the
 administration
 might
 create


a
 robotic
 ZAR,
 I
 would
 not
 hold
 on
 to


this
 because
 I
 mean
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 it's
 a
 $96
 million
 company.
 I
 don't


think
 the
 administration
 is
 going
 to


care
 that
 much
 about,
 you
 know,
 an


under$und00
 million
 company.
 But
 number


two
 is
 just
 like
 the
 the
 robotics
 thesis


for
 the
 administration
 is
 going
 to
 be


more
 towards
 manufacturing,
 more


towards,
 you
 know,
 the
 stuff
 that
 Amazon


and
 Tesla
 and
 Symbotic
 are
 doing.
 Maybe


not
 what
 the
 smaller
 companies
 are
 doing


because
 they
 c
 could
 they
 catch
 a
 bid


being
 in
 the
 robotics
 bucket.
 Yeah.
 But


if
 you
 bought
 it
 for
 that
 pure
 reason,
 I


wouldn't
 count
 on
 it
 to
 be
 the
 case.
 Uh


yeah,
 iRoot
 is
 Roomba
 for
 those
 that


don't
 know.
 So,
 it's
 I
 don't
 know if
 the


administration
 cares
 that
 deeply
 about


uh
 something
 cleaning
 your
 house
 in
 that


respect.
 So,
 yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know


why
 it's
 pumping
 20%,
 but
 if
 you're
 up


on
 this
 and
 you
 don't
 have
 like
 a


fundamental
 thesis,
 you
 just
 bought
 it


for
 the
 hell
 of
 it.
 I
 mean,
 personally,


I
 would
 just
 take
 the
 profit
 and
 get
 out


and
 see
 how
 this
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.


Warner
 Brothers
 right
 there,
 that's
 up


4%
 in
 the
 pre-market.
 Again,
 for
 those


that
 missed
 the
 news,
 uh
 Netflix
 is


acquiring
 Warner
 Brothers
 officially.


It'll
 take
 about
 a
 year
 for
 this
 to
 get


regulatory
 approval,
 maybe
 less
 if


Netflix
 and
 Warner
 Brothers
 have
 someone


in
 the
 administration
 that
 can
 fasttrack


this.
 And
 Netflix
 will
 have
 all
 the


juicy
 content
 that
 currently
 exists
 on


HBO
 Max.
 Okay.
 So,
 uh,
 the
 Nvidia


interview
 that
 I
 did
 last
 night.
 So,


over
 the
 next
 coming
 days,
 I'll
 be


posting
 that
 interview.
 I
 interviewed
 a


man
 named
 Justin,
 who
 is
 one
 of,
 uh,


Jensen's
 30
 direct
 reports.
 And,
 uh,
 the


conversation
 I
 had
 with
 him,
 I
 thought


was
 really,
 really
 interesting.
 So,
 we


did
 the
 interview.
 I
 did
 it
 with
 him
 and


Kevin.
 Kevin
 is
 one
 of
 the
 core
 uh
 leads


for
 commercial
 sales
 at
 Palanteer
 and
 it


was
 a
 great
 interview.
 It's
 about
 15


minutes
 and
 it'll
 be
 uploaded
 next
 week.


But
 the
 description
 of
 the
 partnership


and
 I
 got
 to
 talk
 to
 someone
 named
 Zach


who
 is
 one
 of
 the
 chief
 guys
 underneath


Sham
 Sanker
 at
 Palanteer.
 Um
 and
 he
 he's


out
 of
 the
 London
 office,
 but
 he
 was
 in


New
 York
 yesterday
 and
 and
 he
 kind
 of


was
 really
 describing
 the
 partnership.
 I


know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 still
 kind
 of


confused
 on
 sort
 of
 the
 metrics
 of
 the


partnership,
 but
 at
 its
 core
 basically


they
 both
 realized,
 hey,
 if
 Palunteer
 is


able
 to
 provide
 software
 to
 companies


that
 can
 operationalize
 the
 LMS
 in
 a


more
 sophisticated
 way,
 especially
 with


all
 the
 CUDA
 libraries
 and
 the
 Nemo


models,
 which
 is
 all
 of
 Nvidia's


proprietary
 software,
 then
 that
 just


means
 more
 GPU
 and
 compute
 demand


because
 if
 you
 have
 the
 software
 that's


having
 more
 API
 calls,
 whether
 it's


entropic,
 GPT,
 what
 Gemini,
 whatever
 it


is,
 I
 mean
 all
 of
 those
 are
 going


through
 an
 accelerated
 computer
 uh
 in


some
 data
 center
 in
 some
 place.
 So
 for


Nvidia
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 and
 for


Palunteer
 it
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense


because
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day
 you're


having
 to
 use
 their
 ontology
 to
 be
 able


to
 make
 sense
 of
 those
 LLMs.
 So
 it


really
 is
 a
 chips
 and
 ontology
 type
 of


thesis.
 But
 the
 way
 he
 described
 the


partnership
 I
 actually
 got
 to
 see
 a
 boot


camp
 yesterday.
 So
 I
 was
 in
 a
 boot
 camp


earlier
 in
 the
 day
 with
 Nvidia
 Pal
 and


uh
 we
 talked
 about
 the
 boot
 camp
 in
 the


interview.
 It
 was
 really
 cool.
 It
 was
 it


was
 seven
 or
 eight
 customers
 that


actually
 started
 building
 using
 some
 of


their
 data
 on
 the
 collaborative
 tools


and
 the
 the
 new
 models
 that
 Nvidia
 and


Pounder
 launched
 together.
 And
 it
 I
 mean


the
 time
 to
 value
 for
 some
 of these


customers
 to
 just
 see
 what
 they
 could


do,
 what
 the
 potential
 of
 what
 the
 world


could
 look
 like
 if
 they
 were
 to


integrate
 on
 this
 was
 so
 quick.
 And
 I


think
 the
 big
 synergy
 here
 is
 that


Palenter
 only
 wants
 to
 get
 paid
 if
 they


prove
 that
 they
 can
 make
 you
 more
 money


and
 Nvidia
 only
 wants
 to
 sell
 GPUs
 if


they
 can
 prove
 that
 the
 value
 of
 those


GPUs
 can
 accelerate
 the
 transformation


of
 whatever
 industry
 they're
 getting


into.
 So
 both
 sides
 are
 very
 rooted
 in


this
 idea
 of
 we
 need
 to
 create
 the
 value


to
 justify
 the
 value
 that
 we
 get.
 And


that's
 basically
 what
 Justin
 was
 saying


yesterday
 as
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 him
 from


Nvidia
 side.
 So
 after
 the
 interview
 when


we
 went
 to
 just
 get
 a
 beer,
 that's
 when


we
 like
 really
 got
 to
 talk
 and
 have
 some


fun.
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 "So
 what
 who
 what


like
 who
 is
 Jensen
 like?"
 Like like
 what


is
 like
 like
 you
 know
 this
 guy's
 running


a$
 four
 and
 a
 half
 trillion
 dollar


company
 and
 he's
 talking
 about
 he
 reads


thousands
 of
 emails
 every
 day.
 For
 those


that
 didn't
 see
 this
 clip,
 this
 12


second
 clip
 has
 been
 going
 viral
 as
 well


where
 Joe
 Rogan
 asked,
 "What
 does
 his


day
 look
 like?"
 And
 Jensen's
 like,


"Well,
 I'm
 wake
 up
 at
 4
 a.m.
 and
 I
 read


emails
 every
 day."
 You
 know,
 I
 probably


read
 several
 thousand
 emails
 a
 day.
 You


know,
 I
 probably
 read
 several
 thousand


emails
 a
 day.


>> How
 How
 do
 you
 have
 the
 time
 for
 that?


>> I
 wake
 up
 early
 this
 morning.
 I
 was
 up


at
 4:00.


>> How
 much
 do
 you
 sleep?


>> Uh,
 six,
 seven,
 six,
 seven
 hours.
 Yeah.


>> Now,
 I
 saw
 that
 clip
 and
 I
 didn't
 really


believe
 it.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 lie.
 Like,


I
 love
 Jensen,
 but
 I
 I
 really
 didn't


believe
 it.
 I
 was
 like, "This
 guy
 is
 not


reading
 several
 thousand
 emails
 every


day."
 And
 after
 talking
 with
 Justin,
 it


is
 really
 hard
 to
 deny
 his
 work
 ethic.


So
 this
 guy
 Justin
 joined
 Nvidia
 back
 in


2005
 or
 sorry
 2008.
 He
 left
 in
 2014.
 And


the
 reason
 he
 left
 in
 2014
 is
 because
 he


was
 like
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 like
 I
 was


dating
 and
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 like
 solidify


a
 girl
 who
 I
 was
 with
 and
 trying
 to
 you


know
 turn
 that
 into
 marriage.
 And
 you


know,
 we'd
 be
 out
 for
 a
 Sunday
 afternoon


brunch
 and
 I'd
 be
 getting
 texts
 from


Jensen
 about
 I
 need
 the
 slides
 by


tonight.


And
 he
 was,
 you
 know,
 he
 it's
 like,
 do
 I


pick
 the
 girl
 or
 do
 I
 pick
 this
 career


with
 Nvidia?
 And
 that's
 when
 Nvidia


stock
 was
 not
 going
 to
 the
 moon.
 That


was
 like
 kind
 of the
 10
 years
 where


Nvidia
 was
 stuck
 basically
 doing


nothing.
 And
 so
 he
 left
 in
 2014
 and
 he


told
 Jensen,
 he
 was
 like,
 I
 just
 I
 just


can't
 give
 you
 the
 the
 work
 ethic
 that


you
 require
 out
 of
 me.
 And
 the
 fact
 that


the
 guy
 had
 to
 leave
 the
 company,
 again,


this
 is
 one
 of
 Jensen's
 direct
 reports.


He
 has
 30
 direct
 reports.
 This
 guy
 talks


to
 Jensen
 basically
 every
 day.
 The
 fact


that
 he
 had
 to
 leave
 because
 he
 could


not
 and
 that
 was
 when
 Nvidia
 stock
 was


not
 going
 to
 the
 moon.
 So
 Jensen's
 still


workaholic,
 you
 know,
 trying
 to
 take


over
 the
 world.
 Um,
 and
 he's
 demanding


this
 guy
 who's
 trying
 to,
 you
 know,
 get


this
 girl
 to
 marry
 him
 on
 a
 Sunday
 when


he's
 supposed
 to
 be
 off
 from
 work.
 He's,


you
 know,
 Jensen's
 asking
 for
 for
 things


to
 get
 done.
 And
 the
 the
 guy
 ultimately


concluded
 I
 had
 to
 leave
 because
 I
 could


not
 have
 the
 type
 of
 work
 ethic
 that
 was


required
 to
 be
 an
 actual
 operator
 at


Nvidia.
 He
 ended
 up
 coming
 back
 in
 2018


after
 he
 got
 married
 and
 had
 some
 kids


and
 you
 know
 he
 Jensen
 welcomed
 him
 back


with
 open
 arms
 because
 he
 was
 he
 was


happy
 that
 he
 came
 back.
 So
 it
 was


stories
 like
 that
 that
 he
 was
 telling
 me


that
 was
 just
 like
 pretty
 incredible
 to


define
 the
 guy's
 work
 ethic
 and
 you
 know


quite
 frankly
 it
 made
 me
 want
 to
 buy


more
 Nvidia
 just
 like
 you
 hear
 all
 these


stories
 about
 Jensen
 but
 when
 then
 you


actually
 hear
 people
 that
 talk
 to
 him
 on


a
 daily
 basis
 and
 how
 they're
 uh


interpreting
 this
 guy's


attitude
 towards
 the
 work
 it
 becomes


credible.
 And
 so
 then
 I
 asked
 him,
 I
 was


like,
 "Well,
 you
 know,
 the
 company's


four
 and a
 half
 trillion.
 You
 know,
 how


is
 that
 work
 ethic
 still
 alive
 after
 all


he's
 done?"
 And
 he's
 like, "Dude,
 he


really
 doesn't
 care
 about
 the
 money."


Like
 all
 these
 guys
 are
 rich.
 They
 have


more
 money
 than
 they
 can
 ever,
 you
 know,


that
 they
 know
 what
 to
 do
 with.
 He


really
 cares
 and
 he
 really
 believes
 that


what's
 going
 on
 right
 now
 in
 the
 world


of
 AI
 and
 accelerated
 computing
 is
 such


a
 massive
 opportunity.
 Nvidia
 spent
 30


years
 waiting
 for
 this
 moment.
 They
 had


the
 gaming
 cycle
 when,
 you
 know,
 video


game
 graphics
 cards
 were
 like
 a
 big


thing
 and
 they
 were
 continuing
 to
 grow.


Then
 you
 know
 they
 had
 crypto
 mining


rigs
 that
 ended
 up
 creating
 some
 demand.


They
 had
 all
 these
 little
 different


little
 cycles
 because
 semiconductors
 are


a
 cyclical
 business
 that
 gave
 them


demand
 and
 then
 that
 demand
 ended
 up


dying
 out.
 This
 is
 one
 of
 those
 things


where
 it's
 like
 it's
 very
 hard
 to


imagine
 the
 demand
 dying
 out
 anytime


soon.
 And
 it
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 embodied


use
 cases
 of
 these
 GPUs
 is
 getting
 them


into
 the
 world
 and
 creating
 these
 data


centers
 and
 factories.
 So
 then
 I
 asked


the
 guy
 question,
 well
 everyone's
 saying


it's
 an
 AI
 bubble.
 What do
 you
 think


about
 that?
 And
 he
 and
 his
 answer
 was


really
 simple.
 He
 was
 just
 like,
 I
 don't


think
 people
 recognize
 the
 level
 of


scale
 of
 the
 numbers
 that
 we
 have
 when


it
 comes
 to
 building
 out
 intelligence


factories.
 And
 he's
 just
 like,
 it's
 a


very
 simple
 argument.
 If
 you
 think


intelligence
 is
 the
 new
 oil
 and
 that
 is


going
 to
 be
 in
 every
 single
 sector
 of


not
 only
 the
 United
 States
 economy,
 but


the
 global
 economy,
 then
 the
 amount
 of


compute
 that
 we
 have
 to
 build
 to
 be
 able


to
 power
 that
 is
 so
 astronomical
 that


people
 can't
 wrap
 their
 heads
 around
 it.


And
 he's
 like,
 I
 don't
 blame
 people
 for


not
 being
 able
 to
 understand
 it,
 but


nonetheless,
 it
 is
 real.
 It
 is


happening.
 and
 you
 know,
 Nvidia
 is
 at


the
 forefront
 of
 of
 making
 that
 happen.


So,
 it
 was
 really
 cool.
 It
 was
 really


cool
 just
 to
 get
 his
 perspective
 on
 kind


of
 how
 he
 thinks
 of
 Jensen
 and
 how
 much


of
 a
 hard
 worker
 Jensen
 is.
 And
 it's


inspiring.
 I
 mean,
 Jensen's
 60
 years


old.
 He's
 every
 single
 day
 going
 at
 it.


You
 know,
 he
 said
 Jensen
 probably
 works


18
 hours
 a
 day
 still
 to
 this
 day.
 And


now
 I
 believe
 him
 given
 given
 the
 guy


had
 to
 quit
 because
 he
 could
 not
 handle


the
 the
 workloads
 that
 Jensen
 was


putting
 on
 him.
 That
 was
 before
 the


incentive
 of
 you
 know
 maintaining
 the


pressure
 of
 keeping
 the
 stock
 up
 was


there
 because
 the
 stock
 was
 doing


nothing
 shows
 me
 that
 now
 that
 the
 stock


is
 actually
 in
 the
 right
 direction
 and


people
 you
 know
 believe
 so
 much
 in


Nvidia
 that
 the
 work
 ethic
 is
 probably


only
 even
 stronger.
 So
 it
 was
 a
 fun


conversation.
 It'll
 be
 out
 soon
 and
 I


think
 people
 will
 enjoy
 it.
 S&P
 500


right
 there
 684.
 Amazon
 is
 up
 about.33%


and
 then
 Meta


is
 up
 about


half
 a
 percent
 as
 well.
 Who's
 buying


Netflix
 and
 SoFi?
 Put
 in
 the
 chat.
 I
 see


a
 couple
 people
 saying
 they're
 buying


Netflix
 and
 SoFi.
 65%
 of
 you
 say
 the


SoFi
 dip
 will
 get
 bought.
 We
 are
 going


to
 find
 out
 in
 four
 minutes.
 Why
 is


Inotto
 releasing
 a
 PR
 to
 calm
 investors


down?
 It's
 a
 good
 question.
 I
 don't


think
 Well,
 they
 did
 do
 a
 PR
 last
 time


when
 they
 had
 the
 dilution,
 right?


Am
 I
 tripping?
 Or
 they
 did
 or
 was
 it


just
 a
 regular
 PR
 that
 just
 said
 they


diluted?


We
 got
 the
 pricing
 of
 the
 common
 stock.


Pricing
 is
 2750.
 Yeah,
 I
 I
 mean
 I
 guess


whenever
 not
 does
 an
 interview
 next.


He'll
 probably
 explain
 it.
 Let's
 see.
 A


couple
 people
 saying
 buying
 some
 more


SoFi.
 2750.
 8.18
 million
 shares.


Well,
 54
 million
 shares.
 That's
 2750.


And
 then
 they
 have
 an
 option
 for
 another


8
 million.
 And
 this
 will
 be
 by
 Goldman


Sachs.
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think
 you
 got
 to


be
 patient
 on
 this
 one.
 You
 gotta
 be


patient
 on
 this
 one
 for
 SoFi


to
 see
 when
 this
 ends
 up
 happening.
 I


see
 a
 decent
 amount
 of
 uh
 Netflix
 is
 in


the
 chat.


Tanner
 says,
 "What
 would
 the
 PR
 say?"


The
 PR
 would
 say


that


um


he's
 buying
 out
 Tanner
 Future
 Investing.


That's
 why
 they
 raised
 1.5
 billion
 to


buy
 out
 Tanner.


That
 was
 the
 goal.
 Tanner
 will
 be
 an


actual
 SoFi
 spokesperson.


It's
 pretty
 hefty
 price.
 I
 wish
 I
 could


get
 1.5
 billion
 for
 that.
 That's
 a
 hell


of
 a
 buyout,
 dude.


So,
 that's
 that's
 that's
 what
 the
 PR


would
 say.
 So
 far,
 right
 there,
 down


about
 7.5%


as
 we
 have
 three
 minutes


before
 we
 open
 up
 this
 market.


Uh
 Aid,
 it's
 interesting
 because
 the


closing
 of
 the
 equity
 offering
 is
 Monday


after
 S&P
 inclusion.
 So,
 Tudes
 can
 buy


1.8
 billion
 Monday
 at
 2750
 when
 it's
 at


31.


Well,
 that
 is
 kind
 of
 interesting
 that


the
 timing
 is
 on
 Monday.
 I
 didn't
 know


that.
 The
 question
 is,
 does
 SoFi
 get
 in


to
 the
 S&P
 today?
 I
 mean,
 wouldn't
 that


be
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 Christmas
 present
 for


everybody?
 That
 would
 be
 fun,
 dude.
 That


would
 be
 so
 cool
 if
 they
 actually
 get


in.


I
 mean,
 again,
 S&P
 is
 always
 a
 little


weird
 and
 they
 like
 taking
 their
 time


with
 this
 stuff,
 but
 what
 other


companies
 are
 up
 for
 up
 for
 even


eligibility?
 I
 know
 Reddit's
 one
 of


them.
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 couple
 software


names,


but


I
 don't
 know
 how
 many
 others
 that
 are


out
 there.
 Adobe
 has
 earnings
 uh
 next


week.
 Josh
 Wolf
 from
 Lux
 Capital,
 which


is
 a
 very
 uh
 techoriented
 VC
 fund,
 like


deep
 tech,
 hardware,
 robotics,
 etc.
 They


came
 up
 with
 this
 new
 AI
 model
 on


evaluating
 stocks,
 and
 they're
 not
 like


Goldman
 Sachs
 or
 JP
 Morgan
 or
 anything,


but
 you
 know,
 they
 have
 their
 own


different
 in-house
 proprietary
 models


they're
 using.
 he
 tweeted
 out
 that
 uh


their
 AI
 model
 told
 them
 that
 Adobe
 is


the
 most
 undervalued
 and
 oversold


uh
 tech
 stock
 in
 the
 public
 markets


which
 look
 is
 probably
 right
 to
 an


extent


um
 but
 the
 question
 is
 is
 it
 just


Salesforce
 where
 the
 narrative
 is
 so
 bad


on
 Adobe
 that
 it
 doesn't
 really
 make
 a


move
 or
 is
 Adobe
 like
 a
 unh
 where
 you


know
 they
 they
 shift
 the
 narrative
 a


little
 bit
 get
 some
 better
 EPS
 growth


and
 then
 boom,
 you're
 back
 into


business.


>> I
 could
 have
 said
 that
 without
 AI.
 Yeah,


you
 probably
 could.


So,
 I
 don't know.
 We're
 gonna
 see.
 Maybe


Adobee
 is
 worth
 the
 deep
 dive.
 I
 really


wish
 Canva
 were
 to
 go
 public
 next
 year


and
 maybe
 that
 ends
 up
 happening.
 But,


uh,
 it's
 definitely
 one
 of
 those
 names


to
 at
 least
 potentially
 look
 at
 if
 it


continues
 staying
 at
 these
 levels.
 All


right,
 folks.
 Let's
 get
 into
 it.
 Thank


you everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 First


Friday
 of
 December,
 Friday,
 December


5th,
 9:30
 a.m.
 The
 stock
 market
 once


again
 is
 open.


All
 right,
 wake
 your
 ass
 up.
 Let's
 get


into
 it.
 S&P
 500o
 68550.


We
 are
 green.
 SoFi
 dip.
 Let's
 see
 what


happens
 with
 this
 one.
 2733.


You're
 down
 7.6%.


Not
 really
 seeing
 the
 dip
 buyers
 come
 in


yet,
 but
 it
 is
 indeed
 down.
 Meta
 665,


that's
 up.
 Robin,
 that's
 down
 about


1.72%.
 Netflix
 continues
 to
 go
 down
 4.7%


down.
 Netflix
 now
 year
 to
 date,
 it
 was


up
 30%.
 Year
 to
 date,
 it
 is
 now
 up,
 wow,


11%.


I
 didn't
 even
 realize
 Netflix
 lost
 20%


over
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 months.
 It
 was


at
 $88
 on
 January
 2nd.


And
 this
 is
 all
 postsplit.
 Wow.
 Netflix


underperforming
 the
 market
 now.
 It
 looks


like
 they're
 giving
 up
 the
 short-term


gains
 of
 2025
 to
 build
 for
 the
 next


decade.
 Pounder
 right
 there
 at
 178.
 That


goes
 green.
 Snowflake
 down
 another
 1.6%.


Oaklo


down
 6%.
 Bloom
 Energy
 down
 3%.
 SMR
 down


about
 4.2%.
 VRT
 is
 up
 a
 little
 bit.


UiPath,
 congrats
 to
 those
 that
 got
 into


this
 one.
 18
 still
 up
 about
 20%
 for
 the


week.
 AMD
 getting
 a
 nice
 little
 move
 219


on
 AMD.
 Nvidia
 18450.
 Nvidia
 and
 AMD


both
 getting
 some
 love.
 S&P
 I
 think


Nvidia
 is
 helping
 the
 S&P
 right
 there.


686.
 Again,
 we
 get
 um
 PCE
 in
 30
 minutes.


So,
 for
 those
 that
 are
 making
 trades,


just
 just
 realize
 PC
 in
 30
 minutes


probably
 has
 somewhat
 of
 an
 impact
 on


the
 broader
 market.
 We're
 going to
 see


how
 that
 one
 plays
 out.
 Rubric
 also


amazing
 earnings
 yesterday,
 23%.


Shout
 out
 to
 Sam.
 I
 know
 he's
 heavy
 on


this
 one.
 $87
 right
 there.
 This
 stock


was
 around
 this
 range
 a
 month
 ago
 and


then
 it
 fell.
 So,
 it
 gave
 people
 an


opportunity
 to
 get
 in
 about
 25%
 cheaper.


And
 if
 you
 bought
 yesterday,
 you
 are


probably
 liking
 this
 price
 action.
 88
 on


Rubric.
 Wow,
 this
 one's
 just
 running.


Straight
 up
 running.
 Look
 at
 that.
 26%.


Not
 even
 stopping
 on
 this
 one.
 So
 you


got
 Rubric
 right
 there
 at
 88
 bucks.


Again,
 SoFi
 is
 down
 because
 of
 a
 $ 1.5


billion
 offering
 yesterday
 for
 those


that
 don't
 know
 why
 it's
 down
 8%
 right


here.
 This
 is
 natural.
 I
 mean,
 when
 you


dilute
 by
 that
 much
 for
 no
 apparent


reason,
 the
 street's
 definitely
 not


going
 to
 love
 it
 in
 the
 short
 term.
 So,


we're
 going to
 have
 to
 see
 until
 we
 get


some
 clarity
 on
 why
 not
 doing
 this.


That's
 down
 about
 7.8%
 right
 there.


Robin
 is
 down
 about
 2.3%.
 Meta


continuing
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 its
 momentum.


Amazon
 finally
 back
 to
 230,
 which
 is


nice.


It's
 been
 stuck
 pretty
 much
 around
 that


227
 to
 230
 range
 basically
 all
 week.


Rock
 Lab,
 that's
 down
 about
 1.3.
 Grabs


at
 530.
 Reddit's
 at
 227.
 Where
 is
 AS


that
 had
 a
 monster
 day
 yesterday
 that's


selling
 off
 just
 a
 little
 bit.
 Got
 back


into
 the
 70s
 only
 down


about
 1.4%


for
 the
 day.
 Apploven
 almost
 back
 to


700o.


This
 one
 got
 to
 freaking
 520


weeks
 ago.
 697
 here
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 these


names
 that
 got
 sold
 off.


Those
 dips
 were


getting
 ready
 to
 get
 bought.
 Okay,
 the


the
 semi
 names


are
 pumping
 pumping.
 Broadcom
 at
 391.


AMD
 is
 also
 making
 a
 big
 move.
 S&P
 looks


like
 she
 wants
 687.


Uh
 AMD
 right
 there
 221.
 Where's
 Google?


Google's
 at
 3.
 Wow,
 Google
 back
 above


320.
 That's
 nice.
 Apple,
 are
 we
 at
 285?


We're
 at
 280.
 Microsoft


still
 at
 480.
 So,
 it
 seems
 like
 AMD
 and


Broadcom
 and
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 Nvidia
 are


really
 helping
 the
 S&P
 today.
 We
 might


have
 some
 of
 the
 healthcare
 stocks
 also.


Yeah,
 Eli
 Liy
 up
 another
 1%.


Okay,
 so
 you
 have
 a
 variety
 of
 different


names
 throughout
 the
 entire
 index
 that


are
 getting


a
 bit
 of
 a
 move
 right
 here
 as
 they're


doing
 well.
 And
 again,
 for
 those
 buying


the
 Netflix
 dip,
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a


horrible
 dip
 to
 buy.
 Um,
 I
 just
 think,


you
 know,
 you
 might
 want
 more
 clarity
 on


the
 economics
 of
 the
 deal.
 But
 if
 if
 you


don't
 even
 care
 about
 that,
 if
 you
 just,


you
 know,
 you're
 buying
 literally
 as


like
 a
 just,
 hey,
 what
 is
 this
 going
 to


do
 for
 the
 streaming
 industry
 if
 it
 gets


approved,
 it's
 going
 to
 create
 a


monopoly
 for
 Netflix?
 Like
 a
 real


meaningful
 monopoly
 once
 HBO
 Max
 is


taken
 out.
 I
 know
 you
 have
 Disney,
 you


have
 Peacock,
 you
 have
 Paramount,
 but


still
 this
 is
 big
 for
 Netflix.
 So,
 if


that's
 the
 thesis
 and
 it's
 a
 5-year


thesis,
 then,
 you
 know,
 obviously
 I


think
 the
 stock
 will
 be
 higher
 than
 it


is
 5
 years
 from
 now.
 But
 question
 is


just
 going
 to
 be
 how
 they're
 going
 to


navigate
 the
 regulatory
 hurdles
 of
 it


and
 what
 it
 means
 for
 the
 actual
 topline


revenue
 growth.
 Nvidia
 right
 there


18370.
 That's
 gets
 a
 red
 candle
 after


getting
 to
 18460.
 There's
 been
 a
 lot
 of


news
 yesterday
 about
 China
 and
 Trump


talking
 about
 getting
 the
 H200s
 into


China.
 You
 know,
 Jensen
 has
 come
 out
 and


said,
 you
 know,
 China
 doesn't
 even
 want


the
 H200s.
 They
 want
 the
 more
 uh


preferred
 chips
 like
 Blackwell.
 So,
 even


if
 that
 does
 get
 approved,
 I
 don't know


if
 that's
 a
 massive
 catalyst
 for
 Nvidia.


The
 the
 big
 headline
 they
 had
 from


Bloomberg
 was
 that
 they
 are
 going
 to
 or


they're
 they're
 winning
 in
 their


lobbying
 efforts
 to
 stop
 the
 United


States
 from
 completely
 banning
 any
 level


of
 China
 chip
 sales.
 And
 that
 would
 be


good
 for
 Nvidia
 and
 AMD,
 but
 ultimately


they
 need
 to
 approve
 the
 best
 chips


getting
 sold


uh
 to
 to
 China.


Austin
 says,
 "I
 bought
 the
 Netflix
 dip.


They
 could
 buy
 WBD
 at
 basically
 any


price
 and
 it'd
 be
 a
 creative."
 Yeah,
 I


mean
 look
 that
 is
 fair.
 I
 think
 that
 I


mean
 if
 they
 paid
 90
 billion
 instead
 of


82
 billion
 like
 yeah
 that's
 a
 hefty


price
 but
 still
 you
 would
 imagine
 that


level
 of
 content
 offering
 would
 be
 a


creative
 to
 a
 company
 like
 Netflix.


Nebia's
 right
 there
 9950
 that's
 down
 3%.


Oracle
 217
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 to
 220.


This
 was
 at
 185
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago.
 Look


at
 Tesla
 455.


Tesla
 holding
 on
 and
 doing
 its
 thing.
 I


don't
 know
 why
 Elf
 pumped
 the
 other
 day.


Is
 Elf
 still
 pumping?
 No,
 it's
 flat,
 but


it
 was
 up
 9%
 like
 on
 Wednesday,
 and
 I


don't
 think
 any
 we
 found
 out
 why.


I
 don't
 think
 there
 was
 like
 any
 major


headline
 or
 uh
 upgrade
 on
 the
 stock.


Google
 right
 there
 321,


but
 ELF
 right
 here


still
 still
 flat.


Um


IOT,
 they
 had
 earnings
 yesterday.
 I


think
 I
 saw
 their
 numbers.
 Wow.
 Up
 11%.


Let
 me
 pull
 those
 up.


Yeah,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 companies
 this
 week


they
 they
 I
 mean
 not
 only
 do
 they
 crush


earnings,
 but
 they
 got
 rewarded
 by
 the


market.
 Oh,
 Trump
 just
 tweeted


something.
 What
 is
 this?


Um,
 I
 have
 just
 approved
 tiny
 cars
 to
 be


built
 in
 America.
 Manufacturers
 have


long
 waited
 to
 do
 this
 just
 like
 they


are
 so
 successfully
 built
 in
 other


countries.
 They
 can
 be
 propelled
 by


gasoline,
 electric,
 or
 hybrid.
 These


cars
 of
 the
 very
 near
 future
 are


inexpensive,
 safe,
 fuel
 efficient,
 and


quite
 simply
 amazing.
 Start
 building


them
 now.
 Thank
 you
 to
 the
 DOJ
 and
 the


Department
 of
 Transportation
 and


Environment.


Tiny
 cars.


Is
 he
 talking
 about
 like
 the
 cars
 you


see
 in
 India
 that
 are
 like
 super
 small?


He's
 talking
 about
 like
 this
 [ __ ]
 like


these
 like
 10
 $15,000
 cars.


What's
 a
 tiny


do
 we
 have?
 We
 have
 shrinkflation


affecting
 cars
 or
 something.
 What's
 uh


IoT
 that's
 up
 11%.
 Where's
 GM
 stock
 on


this?
 GM
 is
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 for
 are
 GM


and
 Ford
 going
 to
 make
 tiny
 cars.


Tesla
 Tesla
 I
 guess
 is
 making
 a
 tiny


Cybert
 truck.
 That
 one's
 green.


Look
 at
 that.
 458


for
 Tessy.


So
 when
 I
 went
 to
 India,
 I've
 seen
 a
 lot


of
 small
 cars.
 I'm
 sure
 people
 in


Southeast
 Asia
 because
 the
 roads
 are


smaller.
 So
 the
 cars
 have
 to
 I
 mean
 not


the
 roads
 that
 not
 necessarily
 the
 roads


are
 smaller,
 the
 roads
 are
 more


congested.
 So
 you
 need
 like
 you
 can't


have
 a
 cyber
 truck
 in
 India.
 Like
 I
 I
 I


don't
 know
 how
 a
 cyber
 truck
 would
 drive


the
 roads
 of
 India.
 So
 um
 the
 question


is
 do
 we
 want
 tiny
 cars
 in
 America
 and


do
 we
 need
 tiny
 cars
 in
 America?


I
 don't
 think
 we
 we
 we
 it
 would
 be


necessarily
 a
 net
 bad
 thing.
 The


question
 is,
 you
 know,
 could
 it
 actually


be
 more
 affordable
 cars
 that
 are
 tinier


for
 people
 that
 can't
 afford,
 you
 know,


a
 regular
 like
 Honda
 Civic?


And,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 that's
 Trump's


economic
 angle
 around
 this.
 Broadcom


still
 up
 2.5.
 Nvidia
 goes
 red.
 So,


Nvidia
 selling
 off
 right
 here,
 18296,


not
 able
 to
 hold
 on.
 Microsoft
 at
 482,


Lily's
 at
 1,00
 then
 Ford


at
 1319.


Nano
 banana
 car.


Um,


all
 right.
 So,
 I
 guess
 that's


kind
 of
 what
 you're
 seeing
 here.
 Yeah.


12,500
 for
 a
 new
 car.
 Definitely.
 I


think
 this
 there's
 an
 economic
 argument


here.
 I
 think
 he's
 trying
 to
 make
 cars


more
 affordable
 to
 an
 extent,


which
 I
 don't
 think
 is
 crazy.


Um,


but
 I
 think
 he's
 trying
 to
 understand
 it


at
 a
 at
 a
 better
 level
 for
 some
 of
 those


lower-end
 consumers
 that
 could
 like
 it.


Ford
 right
 there
 at
 1319.
 That
 is
 green.


Eli
 Liy,
 that's
 at
 10,021
 app.
 Love
 and


690.
 Then
 Broadcom


at
 390


as
 well.
 All right,
 so
 we
 got
 about
 20


minutes.
 We
 are
 going
 to
 get
 that
 PCE


data
 which
 is
 really
 going
 to
 matter.
 By


the
 way,
 IoT,
 they
 beat
 earnings
 by
 25%


and
 beat
 EPS
 by
 4%.
 So
 that
 also


got
 the
 market


getting
 some
 momentum.


Americans
 are
 too
 fat
 to
 be
 in
 the
 tiny


cars.


Oh
 my
 gosh.
 Well,
 you
 know,
 you're
 not


necessarily
 wrong
 there.
 You're
 not


necessarily
 wrong.
 Um,
 China
 updates.


What
 do
 we
 have
 here?
 Uh,
 China
 vice


premere
 held
 call
 with
 US
 secretary


Basent
 and
 Greer.
 Okay,
 so
 we
 had
 China


and


Bent
 that
 is
 talking.
 We'll
 see
 if
 that


affects
 the
 markets
 as
 well.
 686
 on
 the


S&P
 still
 holding
 on
 to
 that
 level
 of


green.
 SoFi,
 are
 we
 getting
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 rebound?
 So,
 no.
 This
 thing
 wants


below
 27.
 Wow,
 we
 did
 hit
 below
 27.
 We


had
 26.94.


on
 SoFi.


Where's
 Bitcoin?
 We
 didn't
 even
 look
 at


Bitcoin
 today.
 Are
 we
 still
 holding
 90?


Oh,
 dude,
 we're
 barely
 holding
 that.
 Why


is
 she
 dumping?


Why
 can't
 she
 just
 stay


at
 93?
 Okay,
 so
 where's
 ETH
 then?
 ETH
 is


also
 losing
 3,200


after
 the
 Fusaka
 upgrade.


Ethan,
 Bitcoin
 both
 down.
 Now,
 if
 SoFi


were
 to
 get
 to
 like
 25s,
 I
 feel
 like


this
 would
 be
 an
 easy
 dip
 by.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 we
 get
 there
 off
 of
 dilution,


especially
 because
 again,
 Sofi
 is
 not


some
 random
 meme
 stock
 that's
 diluting


for
 the
 hell
 of
 diluted.
 They
 don't
 need


to
 dilute.
 They're
 doing
 there
 has
 to
 be


a
 strategic
 purpose
 to
 this.
 It's
 just


we
 don't
 know
 yet.


And
 if
 you
 think
 that
 purpose
 is


reasonable,
 you
 know,
 that's
 where
 you


probably
 meaningfully
 buy
 the
 dip.


Google
 right
 there,
 322.
 Google's
 been


normalizing
 300s.
 It's
 been
 almost
 two


weeks
 where
 we've
 had
 Google
 above
 $300


a
 share.


So,
 it
 is
 very
 nice
 to
 see
 Google


keeping


this
 this
 level.
 Uh
 the
 ECB
 says
 that
 we


see
 significant
 risks
 to
 the
 inflation


outlook.
 We
 see
 downside
 price
 risks
 at


least
 as
 significant
 as
 up.
 Uh
 Neb's


right
 there
 losing
 99.
 The
 day
 center


plays


down
 about
 5%
 on
 the
 day.
 Uh
 yeah,
 Iran


also
 down
 5%.
 So
 ECB
 talking
 about


inflation
 risk.
 Canada
 had
 some
 news.


Their
 jobless
 rate
 fell
 to
 a
 16-month


low.
 The
 unemployment
 rate
 in
 Canada


fell
 to
 6.5%
 above
 expect
 or
 below


expectations
 of
 6.9,
 lowest
 in
 16


months.


Not
 horrible
 for
 Canada's
 labor
 market


as
 you're
 seeing
 across
 the
 world.
 Um


the
 labor
 markets
 are
 not
 necessarily


deteriorating.
 They're
 stabilizing
 even


if
 they
 are
 weakening.
 India
 increased


their
 GDP
 target
 as
 well
 today
 uh
 to


7.3%.


The
 earlier
 expectation
 was
 6.8%
 for


India.


So
 you
 have
 Indian
 GDP
 going
 up,


Canadian
 unemployment
 flat.
 Nvidia


selling
 off
 unfortunately
 down
 1.2%.
 Not


sure
 why
 it's
 getting
 hit
 here
 but
 it's


getting
 hit.
 Hood
 probably
 selling
 off


on
 crypto.
 Amcor
 are
 they
 selling
 off?


Amcor
 holding
 on
 4361.
 This
 has
 been
 a


champ
 all
 week
 holding
 on
 to
 the
 40s


which
 has
 been
 very
 nice.
 Read
 it
 right


there
 at
 228.
 And
 then
 the
 S&P


685.


Netflix
 bounced.


Yeah,
 I
 mean


definitely
 looks
 like
 buyers
 came
 in.


It's
 only
 down
 1%.
 It
 was
 down
 five.
 Now


it's
 down
 one.


Buyers
 came
 in
 at
 around
 98.
 98
 was
 max


pain
 so
 far.
 9774
 for
 Netflix.


So,
 if
 you
 bought
 that
 dip,
 you're
 up


about
 3%
 already.
 Uh,
 fear
 and
 greed.
 We


are
 officially
 past
 extreme
 fear.
 We
 are


at
 40
 41.
 Wow,
 we're
 getting
 close
 to


neutral.


All
 right,
 the
 days
 of
 those
 easy
 dips


might
 not
 be
 as
 easy
 anymore.
 41


on
 fear
 and
 greed.


If
 we
 get
 to
 neutral,
 you
 know,
 that's


where
 things
 might
 start
 stabilizing


more.
 PCE
 in
 15
 minutes,
 I
 think,
 is


going
 to
 really
 determine


what
 direction


we're
 going
 to
 be
 going
 to
 today.


Victoria
 Secret
 up
 15%.
 Did
 they
 have


earnings?


Did
 they
 have
 earnings?
 VCO,
 it
 would
 be


another
 retailer
 that


Wow.
 15%.
 I
 mean
 again,
 why
 are
 these


retailers


able
 to
 sell
 this
 much
 stock
 or
 this


much
 inventory


if
 the
 consumer
 is
 that
 bad?
 Yeah,
 dude.


They
 beat
 by
 54%.


Street
 thought
 they
 would
 lose
 59
 cents


a
 share.
 They
 came
 in
 at
 27
 cents
 loss.


Revenue,
 they
 beat
 by
 5%.
 1.47
 versus


1.41.


I
 mean,
 I
 just
 I
 like
 these
 companies


cannot
 be
 putting
 up
 these
 numbers
 if


the
 consumer
 is
 dead.
 Like,
 they
 just


can't.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 the


consumer
 has
 to
 buy
 stuff
 from
 a


Victoria
 Secret
 or
 Abbercrombie.
 And


that
 doesn't
 mean
 the
 consumer
 is


amazing,
 but
 it
 does
 mean
 that
 it
 might


not
 be
 in
 the
 worst
 situation,
 which
 is


very
 bullish.


Like,
 because
 if
 we're
 getting
 rate
 cuts


and
 the
 consumer
 is
 decent,
 like
 that
 is


not
 a
 bad
 scenario
 going
 into
 2026.


Tesla
 right
 there,
 455.
 Nvidia,
 I
 don't


know
 why
 it's
 selling
 off.
 That's
 weird.


It
 was
 at
 18450
 last
 night.
 It
 was


basically
 at
 18460
 in
 the
 pre-market


and
 then
 immediately
 got
 hit.


We
 should
 be
 expecting
 below
 2.8
 or
 we


should
 be
 hoping
 for
 below
 2.8
 for
 PCE.


The
 expectation
 is
 2.8
 yearly,
 02
 on
 the


monthly.
 This
 is
 for
 September,
 by
 the


way.
 So,
 this
 is
 old
 data,
 which
 means


the
 market
 might
 react
 immediately
 and


then
 might
 not
 care
 because
 like
 the


September
 stuff
 doesn't
 matter
 as
 much


anymore.


But
 there
 might
 be
 a
 moment
 where
 it


ends
 up


giving
 some
 momentum.
 Lulu.
 Yeah.
 So,


I've
 been
 wondering
 when
 Lulu
 is
 going


to
 be
 the
 next
 one
 to
 pump.
 Lulu,
 I


think
 it
 bottomed
 at
 160.
 It's
 at
 187.


That's
 up
 3%
 today
 because
 like
 Lulu
 is


the
 quintessential
 retailer


that
 has
 been
 completely
 sold
 off
 for


the
 past
 basically
 year
 and
 a
 half
 and


the
 retailers
 are
 back
 in
 action
 and


they're
 putting
 up
 numbers.
 Lulu's


earnings
 are
 next
 week.
 That's
 going
 to


be
 a
 big
 one
 cuz
 if
 they
 can
 show
 the


consumer
 spending
 again
 after
 like
 five


quarters
 of
 showing
 consumer
 weakness


and
 blaming
 the
 tariffs
 and
 all
 that


stuff


be
 very
 bullish
 for
 Lululemon


if
 that
 if
 that
 takes
 out.


Why
 is
 Warner
 Brothers
 only
 at
 a
 $62


billion
 market
 cap
 if
 the
 deal
 is
 for
 72


billion?
 That
 is
 a
 great
 question
 and


that
 is
 because
 the
 market
 does
 not


fully
 believe
 this
 deal
 will
 happen.
 So,


when
 a
 stock
 gets
 acquired
 and
 it's
 at
 a


price
 of
 $5,
 for
 example,
 and
 the


stock's
 trading
 at
 350,
 that
 means
 the


market
 thinks
 that
 there's
 a
 30%
 chance


given
 350
 would
 be
 70%
 of
 the
 total
 deal


value
 that
 the
 deal
 doesn't
 happen.
 So,


in
 this
 case,
 the
 market
 is
 basically


saying
 there's
 a
 10%
 chance,
 9.2%
 chance


that
 this
 deal
 doesn't
 go
 through.
 So,


there's
 an
 arbitrage
 there.
 If
 you
 are


so
 convicted
 the
 deal
 is
 happening,
 you


can
 buy
 this
 and
 make
 9%.
 It's
 like


almost
 a
 guaranteed
 9%
 theoretically
 if


the
 deal
 happens
 because
 you
 have
 to
 get


2750
 a
 share.
 But
 if
 it
 doesn't
 happen,


then
 you're
 stuck
 holding
 the
 stock
 and


maybe
 it
 drops
 9%
 if
 the
 deal
 doesn't
 go


through.
 Now,
 based
 on
 the
 press


releases,
 it
 really
 does
 feel
 like
 this


deal
 is
 happening.
 So,
 by
 the
 way,
 back


to
 2750.
 bounce
 stop
 2694,


but
 I
 guess
 we're
 gonna
 have
 to
 see


if
 the
 deal
 ends
 up
 playing
 out.


Anthony
 notto
 is
 not
 on
 the
 board
 of


Warner
 Brothers.
 There's
 no
 way,
 right?


You're
 trolling
 me,
 right?


That'd
 be
 crazy
 if
 not
 was
 Yeah,
 not
 on


the
 board
 of
 this.
 That
 would
 be
 wild
 if


not
 was
 on
 the
 board
 of
 Warner
 Brothers.


That'd
 be
 crazy.
 Yeah.
 5:15
 we'll
 know


about
 the
 S&P
 500.
 5:15
 tonight.


So,
 it's
 going
 to
 take
 till
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 to
 to
 find
 out.
 Doby's
 up
 3%.


All right.
 Getting
 some
 love
 there.


Salesforce
 good
 earnings
 this
 week.
 Was


not
 enough
 to
 really
 really
 move
 the


stock.
 I
 mean,
 you
 got
 somewhat
 of
 a


move.
 Nothing
 crazy,
 but
 it
 is
 up
 3%.


So,
 maybe
 it's
 headed
 in
 the
 right


direction.
 Microsoft
 right
 there
 at
 481.


AMD
 at
 218
 at
 11685


and
 then
 Nvidia
 still
 stuck
 at
 18160


on
 the
 day.
 Yeah,
 Warner
 Brothers
 one
 of


the
 top
 performing
 S&P
 500
 stocks
 just


based
 on
 this
 acquisition
 stuff


which
 is
 pretty
 crazy.


Wait,
 is
 he
 legit
 on
 the
 board?


Dude,
 I'm
 on
 their
 website.
 I
 don't
 see


Nodo.
 That's
 why
 I
 just
 checked.
 I


thought
 you
 guys
 were
 trolling.


Look,
 this
 is
 the
 website.
 Unless
 I'm


looking
 at
 it
 wrong.
 Where's
 Nto?


Oh,
 I
 click
 I
 didn't
 click
 on
 board
 of


directors.
 I
 clicked
 on
 leadership.
 My


bad.
 Oh,
 there
 he
 is.


Okay.
 Well,
 not
 getting
 a
 bit
 of
 a


payday
 then
 if
 he
 owns
 some
 some
 stock.


Huh.
 That
 is
 quite
 interesting
 for
 this


deal
 to
 happen


on
 the
 day
 where
 SoFi
 is
 getting
 this


dilution.


Wow,
 I
 didn't
 know
 that.


I
 don't
 know
 what
 to
 conclude
 from
 that,


but


I
 guess
 that
 is
 kind
 of
 cool.
 Salesforce


right
 there
 up
 three.
 That's
 why
 he


diluted.


Oh
 man.


Yeah,
 iRoot
 now
 40.
 What
 is
 the
 news
 on


iroot?
 Why
 is
 this?
 Are
 they
 getting


They
 were
 supposed
 to
 get
 acquired
 a


long
 time
 ago,
 right?
 Are
 there
 more


acquisition
 rumors?
 This
 thing
 to
 be
 up


46%.


I
 have
 no
 idea
 why
 that's
 there.
 Hood's


dumping
 because
 of
 crypto
 most
 likely.


Um,
 oh
 yeah,
 this
 thing
 was
 weird,
 bro.


This
 thing
 was
 so
 weird.
 How
 much
 did


Perplexity
 shill
 out
 for
 this
 Cristiano


Ronaldo
 partnership?


I
 mean,
 this
 was
 so


like


I
 don't
 know.
 It
 was
 just,
 it
 was
 so


weird.
 Like
 Cristiano
 Ronaldo
 says,


"Winners
 never
 stop
 learning,
 never
 stop


asking."
 They
 have
 this
 cringe


commercial
 about
 Perplexity
 and
 learning


about
 soccer
 and
 stuff.
 And
 to
 me,
 I'm


like,
 this
 is
 what
 Perplexity
 is


actually
 doing
 right
 now.


Like


I
 does
 anyone
 even
 talk
 about
 Perplexity


anymore?
 Do
 we
 do
 we
 even
 care?
 Like
 I


know
 some
 people
 still
 use
 it,
 but
 like


it's
 like


Comet
 I
 tried.
 I'm
 not
 like
 it
 was
 cool


but
 I
 don't
 use
 it
 on
 a
 daily
 b.
 If


anything
 Chrome
 once
 they
 incorporate
 a


lot
 more
 AI
 stuff
 is
 still
 just
 going
 to


be
 what
 I
 go
 to
 every
 day.


That's
 one
 of
 the
 companies
 20
 billion


valuation
 on
 that.
 I
 mean
 I
 still
 think


there's
 an
 exit
 for
 them
 but
 do
 they


become
 like
 a
 250$300
 billion
 company


one
 day
 as
 a
 GPT
 search
 engine
 rapper?
 I


don't
 know.


They're
 sponsoring
 everybody
 right
 now.


But
 the
 sponsorships
 to
 me
 feel
 more


like
 red
 flags
 than
 anything.
 They're


just
 taking
 their
 investor
 money
 and


throwing
 it
 into
 influence
 and
 seeing
 if


they
 can
 get
 users.


Like
 the
 beautiful
 thing
 about


productled
 growth
 is
 that
 when
 a
 product


is
 so
 good,
 it
 just
 grows.
 Like
 yes,
 you


need
 to
 work
 to
 get
 some
 distribution,


but
 if
 a
 product
 really
 is
 that
 good,
 it


is
 going
 to
 find
 more
 people
 and
 those


people
 will
 have
 retention
 and
 they
 will


stay
 using
 the
 product
 because
 the


product
 ends
 up
 actually
 helping
 them
 in


their
 lives.
 when
 you
 have
 to
 pay
 so


aggressively
 to
 soccer
 players
 to
 make


people
 think
 that
 oh
 if
 Ronaldo
 is
 using


it
 then
 I
 should
 be
 using
 it
 like
 that


it
 you
 know
 it's
 not
 really
 the
 type
 of


virality
 as
 a
 fast
 growing
 startup
 that


that
 you
 want
 to
 tap
 into
 Bitcoin
 right


there
 at
 90,000
 S&P
 500
 at
 686


on
 the
 day
 perplexity
 should
 have
 sold


to
 Apple
 when
 they
 have
 the
 chance
 I


wonder
 how
 serious
 Apple
 was
 to
 buy
 them


too
 because
 like
 there
 was
 those
 rumors


that
 were
 going
 out


Maybe
 they
 were
 just
 rumors
 or
 maybe


Apple
 legit
 said,
 "Hey,
 we
 we
 want
 to


swallow
 you
 guys
 up
 and
 say
 put
 you,
 you


know,
 into
 our
 ecosystem,


but
 the
 Perplexity
 CEO
 definitely
 has
 a


lot
 more
 ambitions
 than
 to
 get


acquired."
 Bitcoin,
 it's
 really
 trying


to
 hold
 on
 to
 90,000
 by
 like
 a
 100


bucks.
 Just
 touched
 89
 for
 a
 second.


Same
 thing
 with
 Ethereum.


Just
 trying
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 3,000.
 Uh


silver,
 is
 that
 moving
 today?
 Gold
 is
 up


once
 again.
 Silver.
 Wow.
 I
 think
 this
 is


new
 alltime
 highs.
 5860
 on
 silver.


Goodness,
 dude.


That's
 pretty
 damn
 amazing.


Look
 at
 that
 silver


5860


and
 not
 necessarily
 slowing
 down.
 This


one
 has
 been
 one
 of
 the
 better


performing
 commodities.
 I
 mean,
 one
 of


the
 best
 performing
 commodities


this
 entire
 year.


Uh,
 oh,
 speaking
 of
 robots,


let's
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this.
 Dude,
 we're


talking
 about
 iroot.
 You
 guys
 remember


Bele?
 Bele
 was
 the
 guy
 who
 uh
 who
 who


did
 that
 $69
 million
 NFT.
 Apparently,
 he


has
 robots
 at
 a
 conference
 in
 Miami


called
 Art
 Bosle


>> by
 the
 artist
 Mike
 Wkelman,
 better
 known


as
 Bele.
 And
 basically,
 these
 are
 robot


dogs
 with
 the
 heads
 of
 Jeff
 Bezos,
 Mark


Zuckerberg,
 and
 Elon
 Musk.
 And
 each
 of


them,
 each
 of
 these
 robots
 have
 a


built-in
 camera
 where
 they
 take
 pictures


of
 their
 surroundings.
 Then
 an
 AI


program
 picks
 the
 best
 pictures.
 And


each
 of
 the
 dogs,
 let's
 say,
 releases


the
 pictures
 as
 one
 of
 these
 as
 an
 NFT.


Let's
 hear
 from
 the
 artist.


Increasingly,
 for
 better
 or
 worse,
 our


view
 of
 the
 world
 is
 largely
 shaped
 by


these
 sort
 of
 like
 tech
 billionaires
 who


own
 algorithms
 that
 can
 change
 what
 we


see
 and
 how
 we
 sort
 of
 like
 see
 it.
 And


so
 we're
 seeing
 the
 world
 somewhat
 in
 a


way
 through
 the
 lens
 of
 their
 eye.
 And


so
 I
 think
 um
 and
 that
 is
 a
 sort
 of


power
 that
 they
 have
 that
 is
 much
 more


unilateral.
 They
 don't
 have
 to
 go
 to


Congress
 and
 try
 and
 get
 something


passed
 to
 change
 the
 algorithm.
 They


don't
 have
 to
 lobby,
 you
 know,
 the
 UN


for
 a
 resolution.
 They
 just
 do
 it.


Now,
 people
 made
 10
 of
 these.
 So,
 it's


two
 editions
 of
 five
 different
 dogs.


They
 each
 cost
 $1,000.
 They
 sold
 out.


>> Bro,
 this
 is
 so
 creepy,
 but
 this
 is
 the


world
 we're
 living
 in.
 But
 it's
 so


creepy.
 immediately.
 We
 also
 talked
 to


people
 about
 what
 AI
 means
 for
 art
 and


artists.
 Here's
 what
 he
 said.


>> It
 will
 absolutely
 be
 disruptive
 to


certain
 areas
 of
 the
 craft
 of
 art.
 But
 I


think
 in
 terms
 of
 destroying
 creativity,


I
 think
 that's
 absolutely
 ridiculous.
 I


think
 it's
 just
 the
 opposite.
 I
 think


now
 you
 see
 things
 uh
 that
 have
 to
 be
 so


unique
 and
 and
 new
 and
 novel
 to
 break


through
 the
 noise
 of
 everything
 that
 I


think
 it's
 actually
 raised
 the
 bar
 for


creativity
 in
 many
 ways.


>> And
 guys,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 read
 more
 about


what's
 happening
 here,
 you
 can
 sign
 up


for
 the
 in.


>> Okay.
 So,


I
 guess
 we'll
 see
 how
 the
 market


ultimately
 interprets
 uh


those
 types
 of
 creative
 robot
 projects.


But,
 you
 know,
 in
 the
 age
 of
 robots,
 I


mean,
 you
 know,
 we
 have
 Dude,
 I
 there


was
 this
 account
 yesterday
 I
 saw
 on


Instagram
 as
 well
 of
 like
 actual
 human


robot,
 not
 human
 robots,
 but
 like
 robots


that
 look
 like
 humans
 that
 are
 being


made
 in
 China.
 It's
 getting
 kind
 of


crazy.
 It's
 like
 these
 things
 look
 very


realistic.
 And
 so
 putting
 a
 head
 of
 a


tech
 billionaire
 on
 a
 robot
 dog
 I
 feel


like
 is
 mild
 compared
 to
 what's
 going
 to


happen
 in
 the
 future.


But
 this
 is
 the
 world
 that
 we're
 living


in
 and
 we're
 seeing
 it
 play
 out.
 S&P


high
 of
 days
 five
 minutes
 until
 PCE.


Five
 minutes
 until
 PCE.
 If
 you've
 got


some
 covered
 calls
 that
 are
 really
 close


to
 the
 money,
 uh
 you
 know,
 maybe
 you
 buy


them
 back
 right
 now
 and
 give
 back
 a


little bit
 of
 the
 profit
 just
 in
 case
 we


get
 a
 crazy
 pump.


um
 or
 potentially
 the
 pump
 is
 not
 even


that
 real.
 But
 in
 the
 next
 four
 minutes,


we
 will
 get
 PC
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 see


how
 the
 market
 thinks
 of
 it.


Now
 granted,
 is
 it
 enough
 to
 really
 like


if
 you've
 got
 Nvidia,
 I
 don't
 know,


189
 calls,
 covered
 calls
 today.
 Do
 we


get
 a
 pump
 that's
 enough
 to
 really
 get


Nvidia
 to
 189?


I
 don't
 know.
 But
 it
 really
 just
 I
 guess


depends
 how
 the
 market
 interprets
 PCs.


SoFi
 is
 definitely
 going
 to
 be
 affected


by
 this.
 PC
 is
 important
 for
 them
 in
 the


context
 of
 rate
 cuts.
 Tesla
 454,
 S&P


686,


but
 also
 it's
 September,
 so
 it's
 like


even
 if
 it's
 good
 inflation
 data,
 if
 the


past
 two
 months
 were
 bad
 and
 we
 don't


have
 that
 data
 yet,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 the


market's
 going
 to
 care
 that
 much


about
 September
 data.


Um,


yeah.
 Are
 we
 about
 to
 cook
 or
 are
 we


going
 to
 get
 cooked?
 Is
 that
 Yes,
 that's


what
 I'm
 saying.
 Are
 we
 going
 to
 get


cooked?
 Are
 we
 about
 to
 cooked
 here?


686


on


on
 the
 S&P.


Google
 still
 holding
 300.
 That's
 holding


on
 as
 well.
 That's
 not
 slowing
 down.


Rubric,
 are
 we
 still
 keeping
 20%.
 Still


keeping
 20%.
 Salesforce
 actually
 having


a
 move
 today.
 Salesforce
 and
 Adobe,
 both


of
 these
 names.
 Same
 with
 Lulu.
 Again,


Victoria's
 Secret
 crushed
 it.
 So,
 they


are
 holding
 on.
 Morgan
 Stanley,
 uh,
 they


came
 out
 with
 a
 note
 today.
 They


continue
 to
 think
 that
 December
 rake
 is


going
 to
 happen,
 uh,
 going
 into
 next


week.
 Meta
 today,
 this
 morning,
 said


they've
 struck
 several
 commercial
 AI


data
 agreements
 with
 publishers
 ranging


from
 USA
 Today,
 People,
 CNN,
 Fox,
 the


Daily
 Caller,
 and
 the
 Washington


Examiner.
 Meta
 backed
 away
 from


compensating
 news
 companies
 several


years
 ago,
 but
 has
 resumed
 paying
 for


editorial
 content
 as
 it
 invests
 more
 in


its
 AI
 chat
 tools
 that
 require
 real-time


access
 to
 verified
 news.


So,
 you
 got
 Meta
 dishing
 out
 some
 I


mean,
 like,
 that's
 a
 better
 use
 of
 the


the
 Reality
 Labs
 capital.
 I'd
 rather


them
 pay
 the
 publishers
 and
 just
 say,


"Hey,
 give
 us
 access
 to
 your
 content,"


which
 is
 a
 relatively
 minuscule
 price


Meta
 would
 be
 paying
 for
 this


compared
 to
 what
 they're
 doing
 in
 in


Reality
 Labs.


Yeah.
 Or
 if
 not,
 they
 would
 keep
 getting


sued
 like
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 that's
 been


suing
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 AI
 companies


as
 well.


Okay,
 here
 we
 go.
 One
 minute.
 One


minute.
 I'll
 keep
 the
 screen
 on
 the
 S&P.


I'll
 have
 the
 data
 on
 the
 side.
 We're


getting


consumer
 sentiment,
 core
 PCE
 price,


personal
 spending
 month
 over
 month,


personal
 income
 month
 over
 month.


Um,


and
 then
 the
 core
 PCE
 price
 index


year-over-year.


So,
 we're
 getting
 almost
 seven
 numbers


that
 could
 be
 having
 an
 impact
 here.


Isn't
 that
 so
 fun?
 Friday
 morning,
 all


of
 us
 together,
 Friday
 afternoon
 for


some
 people,
 Friday
 night,


and
 we're
 just
 getting
 ready
 to
 see


if
 the
 portfolio
 moves


super
 up
 or
 super
 down.


just
 all
 here
 together
 waiting
 for
 this


delayed
 number
 to
 see
 what
 happens.


It's
 actually
 pretty
 cool.


It's
 pretty
 cool.
 This
 one
 number
 that


defines
 everything.


Even
 though
 like
 in
 five
 years
 from
 now


this
 number
 is
 not
 going
 to
 mean
 [ __ ]


but
 today
 today
 it
 does.
 It's
 also


exciting,
 bro.
 There's
 this
 like


spontaneity
 towards
 like
 all
 right
 it's


quite
 frankly,
 you
 know,
 we
 talk
 about


prediction
 markets
 gambling.
 This
 [ __ ]


is
 like
 this
 is
 like
 this
 is
 all
 of
 us


wanting
 to
 see
 the
 gamble
 of
 if
 we
 go
 up


or
 down.
 It's
 the
 it's
 the
 thrill


of
 seeing
 what
 happens
 when
 we
 get
 the


data
 up
 687


S&P
 high
 of
 day.
 She's
 moving.
 She's


moving
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 The
 data
 is


2.8
 versus
 2.8
 expected.
 2.8
 versus
 2.8


expected.
 That's
 a
 really
 good
 inline


number
 on
 PCE.
 Month
 overmonth,
 it
 was.3


versus.3
 expected.
 Personal
 spending.3


versus.3
 expected.
 Personal
 income
 04


versus.3
 expected.
 That's
 a
 beat
 to
 the


upside,
 which
 is
 good.
 Consumer


sentiment
 53.3
 versus
 52
 expected.


That's
 a
 beat,
 which
 is
 good.
 And
 then


price
 index
 month
 over
 month
 2
 versus2


expected.
 We
 don't
 have
 a
 single
 miss
 on


this.
 We
 don't
 have
 a
 single
 miss
 on


this.
 S&P
 had
 a
 very
 slight
 green
 candle


and
 now
 it's
 back
 to
 normal.
 Nvidia


little
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 bounce.
 Nothing


too
 crazy,


but
 almost
 every
 number
 here


uh
 in
 line.
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 PCE
 if


that
 came
 in
 at
 like
 three
 or
 3.1
 that


would
 have
 been
 ugly.
 The
 fact
 that
 it


came
 in
 at
 2.8
 is
 nice
 to
 see
 and
 maybe


that
 could
 be
 the
 trend
 for
 the
 coming


for
 the
 coming
 months
 in
 and
 November.


Let's
 get
 a
 little bit
 more
 coverage
 on


this.
 market's
 not
 really
 reacting
 that


crazily,
 but
 the
 numbers
 overall


are
 are
 not
 horrible.


>> Beginning
 September,
 personal
 income


comes
 in
 a
 bit
 stronger
 than
 expected,


up
 4/10,
 following
 at least
 up
 till
 now


an
 unrevised
 4/10.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the


spending
 side,
 up
 3/10
 as
 expected,
 half


in
 the
 rearview
 mirror,
 which
 was
 up


610.
 Up
 3/10
 actually
 is
 the
 lightest


going
 back
 to
 May
 when
 it
 was
 unchanged.


If
 we
 look
 at
 personal
 spending
 on
 the


real
 side,
 accounting
 for
 inflation,
 it


is
 a
 goose
 egg.
 Zero
 zero
 and
 zero
 would


be
 the
 lightest
 going
 back
 to
 minus


one/10enth
 in
 May.
 Let's
 look
 at
 the


price
 con
 uh
 PCE
 price
 index
 on
 a


month-over-month
 basis.
 This
 of
 course


is
 the
 money
 ball
 up
 3/10
 as
 expected.


Same
 as
 last
 look.
 If
 we
 look
 at


year-over-year,
 it's
 up
 2.8
 exactly
 as


expected.
 One/10enth
 warmer
 than
 the


rear
 view
 mirror.
 2.8
 8
 would
 be
 the


warmest
 since
 March
 of
 last
 year.
 And


now
 if
 we
 go
 core
 month
 overmonth
 PCE


comes
 in
 at
 210
 as
 expected
 equals
 last


month.
 And
 if
 we
 look
 at
 year-over-year,


it's
 up
 2.8
 on
 core,
 which
 equals


expectations.
 One/tenth
 lighter
 than
 the


rear
 view
 mirror.
 Now
 let's
 look
 at


Michigan.
 These
 are
 preliminary
 December


numbers.
 Preliminary
 December
 numbers.


53.3.


That's
 a
 nice
 beat.
 53.3
 would
 be
 the


best
 since
 October
 when
 it
 was
 53.6.


If
 we
 look
 at
 the
 current
 conditions,


50.7,
 that's
 a
 miss.
 50.7's
 a
 miss.
 That


follows
 a
 51.1.


And
 50.7.


Well,
 50.7
 would
 be
 very
 close
 to
 the


all-time
 low,
 which
 was
 our
 last
 look
 at


51.
 S&P
 now
 making
 a
 move.
 There
 you
 go.


All right,
 let's
 see
 if
 it
 can
 hold.
 But


there's
 your
 high
 of
 day.
 68754


making
 a
 move
 right
 here.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 enough
 of
 a


breakout
 move
 for
 alltime
 highs,
 which


is
 about
 a$150
 away,
 but
 if
 it
 is,
 that


would
 be
 fun.
 Nvidia
 bounced
 very


slightly.
 Still
 at
 18250.


SoFi


little
 move.
 Bitcoin
 Bitcoin
 91


that's
 bullish.


Got
 a
 $1,000
 candle.
 Same
 thing
 with


ETH.
 Moving
 up
 about
 100
 bucks.


Uh
 BMR
 should
 be
 moving.
 BMR.
 Yeah,


there's
 a
 green
 candle
 right
 there.


Almost
 break
 even
 on
 the
 day.


S&P
 stills
 go.
 I
 mean,
 the
 market
 seems


to
 like
 it.
 Maybe
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


delayed
 reaction
 from
 the
 immediate
 read


of
 the
 number,
 but
 even
 Netflix,
 look
 at


that.
 Almost
 break
 even.


Almost
 break
 even
 for
 Niflex.
 SoFi
 2750.


Whereas
 Palenteer,
 are
 we
 at
 178?
 We


were
 at
 179.


Dude,
 we
 haven't
 seen
 180.
 We
 haven't


seen
 180
 in
 a
 minute
 on
 Palunteer.
 We


fell
 all
 the
 way
 to
 147.


I
 mean,
 this
 could
 be
 good.
 Uh
 oh.
 CNBC


headline.
 The
 Trump
 administration


reportedly
 views
 their
 proposed
 $72


billion
 deal
 for
 Netflix
 to
 acquire


Warner
 Brothers
 with
 heavy
 skepticism.


You
 know,
 technically
 that
 could
 be
 why


Netflix
 is
 going
 up
 right
 now
 because


investors
 might
 not
 like
 that
 Netflix


wants
 to
 pay
 80
 billion
 and
 if
 the
 But


hold
 on.
 No,
 no,
 no.
 That's
 not
 be
 as


for
 the
 agreement,
 they
 have
 to
 pay
 six


billion
 in
 a
 breakup
 fee.
 So,
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 know
 if
 it's
 bullish.
 Six
 billion


is
 better
 than
 80
 billion,
 but
 still
 six


billion


for
 nothing
 if
 this
 doesn't
 get
 approved


is
 not
 bullish
 for
 Netflix.


So,
 I
 I
 think
 they
 are
 incentivized
 to


get
 this
 deal
 done.
 S&P
 687
 663.


Hood's
 trying
 to
 bounce.
 Are
 we
 trying


to
 bounce
 on
 Hood?
 Hoodie.


It's
 trying
 but
 still
 down
 on
 the
 day


again
 with
 crypto
 down.


We're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 pain


on
 Hoodie.
 All
 right,
 let's
 get
 some


more
 coverage
 and
 see
 what
 this
 looks


like.
 But
 overall,
 this
 data,


it's
 relatively
 strong.
 Maybe
 October,


November
 is
 a
 different
 story
 and
 we'll


get
 that
 next
 week.
 But
 this
 data
 is
 not


horrible.


>> It's
 hotter
 than
 they
 want,
 but
 it's


coming
 in
 line
 with
 expectations.
 I


think
 the
 surprise
 would
 be
 if
 we
 saw


some
 sort
 of
 big
 spike
 up
 and
 then
 they


would
 say
 uhoh,
 do
 we
 need
 to
 maybe
 not


be
 cutting
 interest
 rates.
 Also
 good


news
 that
 Rick
 reported
 in
 the
 inflation


expectations
 of
 the
 University
 of


Michigan
 sentiment
 and
 we
 did
 expect


that
 overall
 sentiment
 number
 to
 go
 up.


Remember
 last
 time
 it
 was
 reported
 it


was
 government
 shutdown
 related.
 It
 was


the
 lowest
 level
 since
 June
 2022.
 So
 no


surprise
 we
 went
 from
 51
 to
 what
 did
 he


say
 53
 little
 over
 that
 that.
 Um
 but


otherwise
 you
 know
 the
 income
 and
 the


spending
 numbers
 coming
 in
 line
 it
 it
 it


doesn't
 change


>> the
 spending
 the
 spending
 was
 zero


>> on
 a
 real
 basis.3%


>> oh.3
 on
 a
 nominal
 got
 it


>> so
 I
 mean
 yeah


>> yeah
 no
 it's
 fine
 I'm
 just
 saying
 we


weren't
 imagining
 that
 we
 had
 softened


up
 spending
 in
 the
 in
 the
 fall
 market


went
 through
 that
 um
 the
 market-based


inflation
 uh
 indicators
 have
 been
 very


calm
 they've
 just
 not
 flared
 up
 um
 and


so
 any
 talk
 of
 you
 know
 are
 we
 going
 to


cut
 rates
 too
 much
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 let


inflation
 become
 unanchored.
 It's
 not


showing
 up
 in
 the
 markets.
 Um
 and
 it


seems
 like
 look,
 the
 stock
 market
 was


always
 going
 to
 be
 fine
 with
 2
 and
 a


half
 to
 3%
 inflation
 as
 far
 as
 I
 could


see
 and
 always
 has
 been
 historically.


It's
 been
 basically
 the
 average
 since


1990.
 The
 2%
 issue
 was
 uh
 if
 the
 Fed
 was


going
 to
 try
 to
 wrestle
 it
 down
 there,


then
 you
 were
 going
 to
 have
 to
 probably


deal
 with
 uh
 tighter
 than
 optimal


policy.
 So,
 I
 think
 this
 this
 fits
 fine.


market's
 been
 giving
 these
 numbers
 a
 lot


of
 slack
 because
 they're
 old
 and
 they


maybe
 are
 going
 to
 end
 up
 being
 shut


down
 influenced
 once
 we
 get
 there.
 So,


at
 this
 point,
 uh,
 pretty
 steady
 as
 she


goes.


>> Savings
 rate,
 4.7%.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 it


jogs
 with
 what
 we're
 hearing
 from


companies,
 which
 we've
 heard
 a
 lot
 from


consumer
 companies
 lately
 between
 the


retail
 earnings
 and
 some
 of
 these
 these


conferences.
 Remember
 what
 Walmart
 said


about
 inflation.
 They
 said
 our


expectation
 is
 that
 it'll
 probably
 peak


the
 peak
 impact
 from
 the
 tariff
 cost


that
 is
 around
 the
 beginning
 of
 the


first
 quarter.
 I
 think
 we
 begin
 to
 laugh


it
 and
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 easier
 there,


which
 is
 a
 reason
 why
 the
 Fed
 should


maybe
 look
 through
 the
 one-off
 impact
 of


of
 tariff
 at least
 inflation,
 which
 is


not
 the
 whole
 inflation
 story,
 but
 is


part
 of
 the
 goods
 prices.
 New
 Brands,


just
 another
 big
 consumer
 company
 that


makes
 a
 lot
 of
 staples.
 The
 45%
 that
 we


import
 that
 are
 subject
 to
 tariffs,


that's
 a
 big
 chunk.
 We
 took
 three
 rounds


of
 pricing
 and
 we
 took
 pricing
 early
 and


pretty
 aggressively
 to
 maintain
 the


structural
 economics
 of
 the
 business.


What
 I'm
 getting,
 Mike,
 is
 that
 we
 might


be
 going
 through
 the
 kind
 of
 worst
 of


the
 the
 tariff
 impact.
 I
 heard
 that
 from


PBH
 that
 it's,
 you
 know,
 starting
 to
 hit


in
 the
 holiday
 season
 and
 that
 looking


ahead
 to
 first
 quarter
 and
 second


quarter,
 you've
 been
 sort
 of
 making
 this


case
 for


>> a
 an
 upswing.


>> I
 mean,
 that's
 the
 read
 on
 how
 the


market
 is
 is
 seeing
 it


>> and
 and
 and
 also
 less
 effects
 of
 the
 of


ultimately
 of
 tariffs,
 whether
 they're


having
 a
 big
 effect
 or
 not


>> or
 we
 just
 anniversary
 them
 and
 it
 kind


of
 gets
 lost
 in
 the
 wash.
 it
 doesn't


really
 address
 the
 what's
 morphed
 into


this
 affordability
 perception,
 right?


So,
 it's
 sort
 of
 like
 I
 agree
 we're
 not


really
 seeing
 an
 an
 extra
 inflation
 push


and
 it
 and
 again
 these
 companies
 that


are
 coming
 out
 with
 these
 reports
 around


the
 consumer
 are
 a
 bit
 more
 bullish
 than


not.
 Fed
 rate
 cuta
 probabilities
 are
 we


finally
 above
 90?
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 are


finally
 above
 90.
 This
 was
 a
 good
 read.


No,
 87.2.
 All right.
 So
 the
 market's


kind
 of
 saying
 it's
 September,
 so
 we're


not
 going
 to
 care
 that
 much.


Still,
 we
 got
 the
 rate
 cut
 coming
 up
 or


the
 FOMC
 meeting
 coming
 up
 in
 five
 days.


So
 holding
 87%.
 S&P
 is
 making
 a
 move.


I
 mean,
 pounder
 back
 to
 180
 after
 almost


a
 month.
 S&P


it
 is
 less
 than
 half
 a
 percent
 away
 from


alltime
 highs.
 We
 did
 touch
 688.
 68940.


68970
 is
 the
 alltime
 high.


I
 mean,
 is
 7,000
 in
 play?


Is
 it
 in
 play?


Would
 not
 be
 crazy
 if
 we
 can
 have
 that


end
 of
 year.
 Okay,
 here's
 a
 question
 for


everybody.
 Do
 we
 think
 the
 rate
 cut
 is


priced
 in?
 Meaning,
 if
 we
 get
 the
 cut
 in


5
 days,
 do
 we
 rip
 or
 is
 it
 pretty
 much


priced
 in?
 My
 take
 is
 I
 think
 we
 get
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 rip.
 Maybe
 it's
 not
 a


massive
 rip,
 but
 I
 think
 we
 could
 get
 a


half
 a
 percent
 to
 1%
 move
 on
 the
 S&P


because
 like
 it's
 finally
 solidified


that
 we
 get
 that
 we
 that
 we're
 cutting


rates


and
 maybe
 it's
 a
 sell
 the
 news
 in
 the


like
 during
 the
 day.
 But
 but
 the


question
 then
 becomes
 throughout
 the


rest
 of
 the
 December,
 right?
 If
 we
 can


move
 higher,
 maybe
 it's
 not
 necessarily


pricing.
 I'll
 do
 a
 poll
 on
 that.
 I
 do


think
 to
 an
 extent
 getting
 back
 to
 you


know
 close
 to
 alltime
 highs
 obviously


there
 is
 some
 level
 of
 pricing
 in
 that


we
 can't
 we
 can't
 say
 isn't
 there
 but
 I


also
 there's
 still
 a
 13%
 chance
 we
 don't


get
 that
 cut
 so
 there's
 still
 the
 market


to
 an
 extent
 saying
 that
 maybe
 it


doesn't
 happen
 oh
 we
 got
 the
 Netflix


co-CEO
 he
 was
 just
 live
 as
 well
 let's


get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 uh
 his
 perspective


here
 on
 why
 they
 ended
 up
 doing
 this


partnership
 Netflix
 now
 going
 green
 on


the
 day
 to
 come.


>> Warner
 Brothers
 has
 some
 of
 the
 best


entertainment
 in
 the
 world.
 Period.


>> Favor's
 been
 helping
 the
 street


understand
 the
 story
 all
 morning
 long


and
 he
 joins
 us
 on
 the
 phone
 with
 more


details.
 Uh
 David,
 as
 Netflix
 is
 poised,


>> this
 deal
 is
 all
 about


the
 combination
 of
 Netflix
 and
 Warner


Brothers
 creates
 a
 better
 Netflix
 for


the
 long
 term.
 It
 sets
 us
 up
 for
 success


for
 decades
 to
 come.
 Warner
 Brothers
 has


some
 of
 the
 best
 entertainment
 in
 the


world.
 Period.
 He's


pretty
 aggressive
 on
 that,
 right?


He's
 trying
 he's
 just
 telling
 his


investors,
 "Guys,


we
 needed
 to
 do
 this
 and
 stop
 freaking


out
 about
 this.
 Trust
 us
 that
 this
 was


the
 right
 move."
 I
 look,
 I
 I
 would
 have


to
 agree
 with
 him.
 I
 I
 think
 it
 was
 the


right
 move.
 Okay.
 You
 need
 to
 acquire


content.
 Yeah.
 You
 put
 a
 period
 on
 it,


too.
 But
 um
 but
 like
 also
 you
 can


imagine
 as
 a
 CEO
 I
 mean
 it
 probably
 gets


frustrating
 because
 the
 pressure
 of


having
 to
 produce
 hit
 shows
 is
 not
 easy


every
 single
 quarter
 and
 sometimes
 you


don't
 know
 if
 a
 show
 is
 a
 hit
 or
 a
 hit


or
 miss.
 It's
 not
 easy
 to
 find
 a
 Squid


Game
 every
 time.


So
 from
 his
 perspective
 he's
 like
 we


have
 all
 this
 cash
 like
 we
 need
 to
 do


something
 with
 it.
 You
 guys
 want
 to
 see


growth.
 Well
 guess
 what
 we
 need
 to
 buy


stuff
 to
 grow.
 And
 this
 is
 and
 and
 you


can't
 get
 mad
 at
 him
 at
 the
 price
 he's


paying.
 It's
 an
 it's
 an
 aggressive
 price


because
 Warner
 Brothers,
 you
 know,


ultimately
 has
 just
 a
 lot
 of
 assets.
 But


it's
 not
 like
 you
 can
 say
 Harry
 Potter


is
 a
 a
 crappy
 asset
 to
 buy
 or
 Game
 of


Thrones
 is
 like
 these
 are
 high
 high


quality
 assets.


So,
 you
 can
 understand
 why
 he's
 excited


for
 it
 or
 at least
 is
 adamant
 around
 it.


Nvidia
 back
 to
 183.
 Maybe
 that
 one
 goes


green
 as
 the
 S&P
 very
 close
 to
 that
 688


level.


to
 see
 if
 that
 ends
 up
 happening.
 Yeah,


Friends
 plus
 Netflix.


That's
 a
 big
 one.


That's
 I
 I
 think
 I
 started
 watching


Friends
 back
 in
 2015
 because
 of
 Netflix,


at least
 originally.


I
 think
 what
 happened
 Well,
 so
 the
 deal


is
 not
 going
 to
 close
 for
 a
 while.
 So,


you
 know,
 if
 you
 have
 HBO
 Max,
 you
 can


see
 keep
 watching
 it.
 But
 I
 imagine
 it's


just
 going
 to
 blend
 into
 Netflix
 and


you're
 going
 to
 pay
 one
 subscription
 for


everything
 and
 your
 account
 will
 just


get
 moved
 over.


688
 S&P.
 Okay,
 here
 we
 go.
 Maybe
 need


a$1.70
 to
 make
 the
 move.
 Dollar
 70
 to


make
 the
 move
 to
 alltime
 highs.


Yeah,
 Harry
 Potter
 on
 Netflix
 is
 a
 big


deal.
 It
 would
 increase
 the
 sub
 account,


correct?
 because
 they
 would
 be
 getting


well
 look
 if
 you're
 overlapped.
 Yeah.


Then
 it
 wouldn't
 increase
 the
 sub
 count,


right?
 Because
 if
 you
 have
 both


subscribers,
 both
 subscriptions,
 it


wouldn't
 matter.
 But
 for
 those
 that
 are


exclusively
 on
 Warner
 Brothers,
 that


would
 be
 a
 big
 deal.
 Poundier


making
 a
 little
 breakout.
 1813.


I
 don't
 think
 uh
 Mr.
 Bur
 is
 happy
 with


what
 he's
 seeing.
 By
 the
 way,
 yesterday


he
 clarified
 his
 iconic
 tweet


uh
 about
 selling


So


remember
 when
 he
 tweeted
 sell
 in


January.
 So
 he
 tweeted
 sell


and
 then
 he
 put
 another
 screenshot


saying
 the
 crisis
 could
 resolve
 very


quickly.
 I
 am
 not
 seeing
 true
 danger


here.
 This
 was
 during
 the
 banking
 crisis


of
 Silicon
 Valley
 Bank
 back
 in
 March.


And
 then
 he
 said
 I
 was
 wrong
 to
 say


sell.
 So
 Bur
 is
 trying
 to
 put
 an
 end
 to


this
 meme
 because
 everyone
 keeps


responding
 with
 like
 bro
 you
 told


everybody
 to
 sell
 before
 the
 biggest


bull
 market
 in
 history.


And
 he's
 trying
 to
 clarify
 by
 saying,
 "I


corrected
 myself
 within
 two
 months."
 I


think
 the
 guy's
 losing
 it,
 bro.
 I
 think


the
 guy's
 actually
 kind
 of
 los
 I
 like,


dude,
 Twitter
 in
 social
 media,
 it
 you


have
 to
 really
 protect
 your
 mental
 when


you're
 dealing
 with
 thousands
 and


thousands
 of
 comments
 and
 opinions
 every


single
 day
 coming
 at
 you.
 And
 uh
 it's


not
 the
 easiest
 thing
 to
 necessarily


navigate.
 This
 guy
 has
 not
 been
 in
 the


public
 for
 15
 years.
 And
 then
 out
 of


nowhere,
 he
 thinks
 he's
 just
 going
 to
 be


able
 to
 handle
 millions
 of
 comments
 and


responses
 every
 single
 day.
 A
 lot
 of


them
 that
 are
 not
 going
 to
 be
 positive.


And
 there's
 definitely
 people
 that
 agree


with
 Bur's
 aisle
 of
 the
 camp
 in
 terms
 of


viewing
 AI.
 And
 those
 are
 the
 people


that
 subscribe
 to
 his
 newsletter
 and


probably,
 you
 know,
 send
 him
 a
 lot
 of


positivity
 on
 the
 work
 that
 he's
 doing.


But
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 people
 that


are
 trying
 to
 make
 sure
 they
 protect


their
 bags
 because
 they're
 loaded
 up


with
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 stocks
 that
 he's


saying
 are
 all
 going
 to
 collapse.


They're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 sending
 him
 the


friendliest
 messages.
 And
 as
 a
 human


being,
 like
 forget
 as
 an
 investor,
 as
 a


human
 being
 able
 to
 deal
 with
 all
 that,


you
 you
 could
 lose
 your
 [ __ ]
 Like
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 he's
 a
 human
 that


has
 to
 deal
 with
 all
 these
 people
 saying


these
 things.
 So
 even
 the
 fact
 that
 he


had
 to
 address
 that
 uh
 the
 meme
 has
 been


corrected
 and
 kind
 of
 remind
 people
 that


he
 that
 he
 uh
 said
 that
 he
 was
 wrong
 to


say
 sell
 two
 months
 later.
 Like
 the
 fact


that
 you
 have
 to
 defend
 yourself
 means


that
 it's
 getting
 to
 you.
 The
 comments


are
 getting
 to
 you.
 And
 it
 happens.
 The


comments
 get
 to
 me
 sometimes
 as
 well.


you
 you
 like
 you
 know
 you
 want
 to
 uh


give
 your
 perspective
 on
 it
 but
 like


what
 happens
 when
 Nvidia
 goes
 to
 250


like
 like
 what
 is
 he
 going
 to
 be
 saying


about
 all
 these
 substacks
 that
 said


Nvidia
 is
 the
 next
 Cisco


now
 granted
 uh
 you
 know
 maybe
 Nvidia


doesn't
 get
 to
 250
 one
 day
 but
 based
 on


the
 conversation
 I
 had
 with
 Nvidia
 and


Palanteer
 yesterday
 and
 just
 how
 bullish


they
 were
 on
 the
 data
 center
 buildout


the
 ecosystem
 all
 this
 I
 mean
 like
 you


trust
 Bur
 or
 you
 trust
 the
 people
 that


are
 actually
 building
 the
 stuff
 I
 mean


what
 happens
 to
 his
 mental
 health
 over


the
 next
 coming
 years
 when
 everyone
 is


spamming
 him
 with,
 "Hey,
 he's
 told
 us
 to


sell
 Pounder
 and
 like
 look
 now
 he's
 got


to
 be
 right
 to
 be
 the
 guy
 who's
 on
 the


island
 who's
 seen
 as
 like
 the
 champion


that
 predicted
 everything
 just
 like
 he


was
 in
 2008."
 But
 this
 is
 a
 really
 tall


order
 to
 be
 right
 on.


And
 if
 it
 doesn't
 happen,
 because
 he's


human
 at
 the
 end of
 the
 day
 and
 he
 might


be
 wrong
 about
 this,


I
 wonder
 how
 he's
 going
 to
 navigate
 that


as
 a
 public
 persona
 because
 in
 2005
 he


wasn't
 a
 public
 persona.
 No
 one
 even


knew
 of
 it.
 They
 knew
 him
 after
 he
 they


see
 they
 knew
 him
 after
 he
 was
 right.
 If


he
 was
 wrong,
 no
 one
 would
 have
 known


about
 it.
 Now
 that
 you
 have
 a
 brand
 and


you're
 publicly
 wrong
 on
 an
 epic
 level,


it's
 a
 different
 mentality.


Chel
 says
 you
 can't
 care
 what
 people


think.
 Oh,
 trust
 me.
 Like,
 you
 have
 to


have
 a
 thick
 skin
 as
 a
 as
 a
 creator
 of


any
 sense.
 But
 at
 some
 level,
 you
 are
 a


human
 being.
 and
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 he


even
 tweeted
 that
 yesterday
 to
 me
 shows


that
 it's
 starting
 to
 get
 to
 him
 because


he's
 probably
 annoyed
 that
 people
 keep


tweeting
 that
 sell
 tweet
 screenshot
 at


him
 and
 he
 you
 know
 he
 probably
 wants
 to


clarify
 but
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 even
 need


to
 clarify
 or
 say
 and
 by
 the
 way
 that


doesn't
 make
 it
 that
 much
 better
 that


two
 months
 later
 you
 say
 you
 were
 wrong


to
 sell
 because
 you
 didn't
 go
 long
 that


was
 only
 March
 of
 in
 March
 of
 2023
 you


could
 have
 gone
 long
 and
 and
 rode
 up
 one


of
 the
 best
 two-year
 bull
 markets
 at


this
 point
 three-year
 bull
 markets
 we've


had
 he
 did
 not
 do
 that


so
 it's
 not
 like
 It's
 not
 like
 he


pivoted.
 He's
 just
 trying
 to
 defend


himself
 from
 all
 the
 trolls,
 which
 means


it's
 probably
 getting
 to
 him.
 Meta
 right


there
 at
 670.
 That's
 up
 1.3.
 That's


making
 a
 move.
 Amazon
 back
 above
 230.


Pouncer
 again
 at

 Nvidia
 cannot


break
 through

 unfortunately.

 also
 going
 red
 on
 the
 day.


Hoodie's
 had
 a
 great
 week
 though.
 I


mean,
 a
 massive
 week
 for

 So,
 that


one
 closing
 above
 130,
 that
 would
 be


nice.
 And
 then
 S&P
 is
 at
 the
 high
 of


days.
 689
 would
 be
 amazing,
 but
 it's
 at


68822.

Doug
 says
 Bur
 was
 right
 on
 his
 blog
 for


a
 long
 time
 before
 he
 quit
 medicine
 to


start
 Scion
 Capital.
 That's
 fair.
 He


was.


And
 then
 it
 ended
 up
 resulting
 in
 this


housing
 crisis,
 right?


It's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 be
 this
 like


ultimately
 all
 will
 be
 forgiven
 and
 he


will
 get
 all
 the
 respect
 in
 the
 world
 if


he's
 right
 that
 AI
 is
 a
 bubble
 and


everything
 collapses


but
 that
 has
 to
 happen


and
 if
 it
 doesn't
 it's
 just
 going
 to
 be


tough
 navigating
 that.


Um
 SMB
 is
 still
 moving.
 She's
 not


stopping.
 Meta
 is
 also
 running.


Meta
 670.
 Dude,
 look
 at
 that.
 671.
 I


mean
 dude
 it
 was
 at
 687
 yesterday
 after


it
 took
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 haircut.
 So,


if
 this
 one
 can
 get
 anywhere
 near
 back


to
 those
 levels,


that
 would
 be
 pretty
 exciting.
 Let's
 get


a
 little
 bit
 more
 updates
 on
 this


consumer
 spending
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep


going
 from
 there.


>> Depending
 on
 what
 happens
 with
 Cook,


that's
 also
 going
 to
 change
 things.
 So,


I
 think
 we
 should
 be
 ready
 for
 the


unexpected
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 rate


expectations
 next
 year.
 I
 totally
 agree


that
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 some
 tailwinds


from
 policy
 next
 year
 in
 terms
 of
 the


tax
 refunds
 stimulating
 consumer


spending.
 But
 then
 what
 does
 the
 Fed
 do


if
 the
 economy
 is
 running
 hot?
 Even
 if


the
 labor
 market's
 soft,
 if
 the
 economy


broadly,
 if
 consumers
 are
 spending,
 if


you
 have
 this
 tailwind,
 it
 like
 you


said,
 if
 you
 had
 a
 a
 jobless
 expansion,


it
 could
 happen.
 It's
 rare.
 The
 last
 one


was
 in
 2001
 and
 it
 got
 solved
 through


Fed
 cuts
 and
 then
 we
 had
 a
 huge
 rally
 in


stocks.
 Will
 it
 happen
 again?
 I
 don't


know.


>> Do
 you
 take
 uh
 any
 message
 from
 the
 fact


that
 Kevin
 Hassid
 has
 been
 the
 odds
 on


favorite
 recently
 uh
 in
 the
 betting


markets
 and
 based
 on
 the
 new
 on
 the


reporting
 and
 the
 markets
 have
 been


pretty
 placid
 about
 it.
 I
 mean
 we
 have


seen
 the
 long
 end
 slightly
 higher
 and
 we


have
 seen
 a
 steeper
 curve
 and
 generally


I
 think
 that
 would
 be
 the
 direction
 of


reaction
 if
 he
 were
 actually
 named
 if


that
 becomes
 reality
 that
 could
 be


really
 good
 for
 bank
 stocks
 financials


um
 it's
 not
 necessarily
 bad
 for
 equities


in
 the
 short
 run
 it
 could
 be
 quite
 good


because
 again
 economy
 running
 hot
 in
 the


medium
 long
 term
 it's
 just
 going
 to


depend
 if
 he
 acts
 independently
 or
 not


if
 he
 does
 and
 there's
 no
 reason
 why
 he


wouldn't
 um
 I
 think
 we're
 great
 we're
 in


great
 shape.
 If
 if
 there
 are
 questions


about
 his
 credibility
 and
 his


decision-making
 process,
 I
 think
 you're


going to
 have
 gold
 higher,
 dollar
 lower,


much
 steeper
 curve,
 and
 higher
 inflation


expectations.


>> What
 would
 that
 look
 like?
 Because,
 you


know,
 people
 say
 this,
 but
 presidents


always
 appoint
 Fed
 chairs,
 right?
 It's


always
 a
 a
 decision
 from
 the
 president.


And
 yes,
 this
 president
 has
 been
 more


outspoken
 about
 what
 he
 wants
 on
 policy,


but
 all
 presidents
 want
 lower
 interest


rates.


>> Correct.
 So,
 what
 exactly
 do
 you
 think


would
 spook
 the
 market
 about
 Kevin


Hasset
 and
 and
 sort
 of
 teeter
 into
 that


that
 blurry
 line
 of
 independence?


>> Hasset
 himself
 doesn't
 worry
 me.
 I
 mean,


he's
 a
 PhD
 economist.
 He's
 incredibly


experienced.
 I
 think
 the
 Lisa
 Cook


decision,
 that's
 a
 much
 bigger
 catalyst.


If
 for
 cause
 allows
 her
 to
 be
 removed


before
 the
 regular
 reconfirmations
 of


the
 Fed
 presidents
 in
 late
 February
 and


even
 if
 they
 aren't
 affected,
 if
 there's


noise
 around
 those
 reconfirmations,
 I


think
 that
 could
 erode
 perceptions
 of


Fed
 independence
 and
 could
 lead
 to
 more


term
 premium
 in
 the
 bond
 yield
 which


pushes
 up
 yields
 overall.
 So
 we
 have


higher
 mortgage
 rates,
 higher
 auto
 loan


costs,
 higher
 corporate
 borrowing
 costs.


I
 think
 that
 would
 not
 be
 good
 for
 the


stock
 market


>> and
 that
 again
 is
 based
 on
 how
 the
 Fed


is
 perceived
 as
 independent
 but
 it


doesn't
 seem
 like
 Hasset
 in
 general


would
 be
 perceived
 as
 the
 least


independent.
 I
 mean
 if
 and
 even
 if
 he
 is


as
 she
 said
 the
 Lisa
 Cook
 stuff
 is
 more


so
 I
 think
 what'll
 trigger
 the
 markets


versus
 like
 the
 president
 picking
 his


own
 um
 Fed
 chair
 pounds
 right
 there
 at


180
 S&P
 she's
 really
 trying.
 It
 looks


like
 she
 wants
 all-time
 highs.
 If
 we
 can


get
 Nvidia
 to
 184ish,
 I
 think
 it
 could


happen.
 Meta
 right
 there
 at
 672.
 QXO,


Steve
 is
 big
 on
 this
 one.
 Uh,
 trying
 to


get
 up
 to
 $21
 today.
 Salesforce
 up
 5%.


Adobe
 up
 5%.


All
 the
 software
 names


uh
 are
 heating
 up.
 Wow,
 look
 at
 the
 heat


map.
 pretty
 much
 everything
 green
 except


Pepsi,
 GE,


Abby,
 couple
 healthcare
 names,
 UNH,


Apple,
 Nvidia,
 obviously
 slightly
 red,


but
 everything
 else


having
 a
 pretty
 strong
 day.
 Let's
 look


at
 the
 stock
 draft.
 We
 haven't
 looked
 at


this
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 days.


All right,
 your
 boy
 still
 in
 first
 place


at
 32%.
 Matt's
 at
 26.
 Tanner's
 at
 22.


Steve's
 at
 four.
 Chris
 is
 at
 nine.


So


for
 Matt,
 I
 think
 Dutch
 Bros
 is
 hurting


him
 the
 most.
 For
 me,
 obviously,
 it's


Dolingo.
 Dolingo
 back
 to
 Dude,
 Dolingo's


almost
 back
 to
 200.


Hold
 on.


Can
 we
 get
 Dolingo
 to
 make
 a
 move?


196.
 This
 thing
 dropped
 to
 what?
 150,


160,
 165.


Maybe
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 love
 right


here.
 Even
 SoFi
 also
 uh
 yeah,
 look
 at


SoFi.
 It
 was
 down
 nine.
 Now
 it's
 down


five.
 So
 again,
 we'll
 be
 live
 on
 the


close
 at
 5:15.
 We
 will
 get
 all
 the


details.
 Netflix,
 by
 the
 way,
 going


green
 as
 well
 on
 the
 S&P
 inclusion.


And


so
 if
 I
 could
 be
 included
 here,


yeah,
 we
 might
 do
 something
 for
 New


Year's
 Eve
 with
 like
 a
 different
 little


stock
 draft.
 So
 we'll
 think
 of


something.


And
 uh
 for
 all
 the
 people
 that
 stay
 home


on
 New
 Year's
 Eve,
 we'll
 see
 what
 we
 can


do.


Um


Tim,
 thank
 you.
 Number
 two
 YouTube


channel
 for
 2025
 is
 Amit
 and
 number


three
 is
 Tanner.
 Me
 and
 Tanner
 have
 been


having
 so
 much
 fun
 on
 this
 thing
 because


like
 some
 people
 tag
 me
 and
 I'm
 ahead
 of


Tanner.
 Some
 people
 tag
 Tanner
 and
 he's


ahead
 of
 me.
 It's
 ironic
 because
 Tanner


is
 my
 number
 one
 channel.
 So,
 it's
 like


for
 all
 the
 people
 that
 are
 tagging
 with


me
 above
 him,


the
 the
 the
 funniest
 thing
 about
 this
 is


that
 he's
 my
 number
 one.
 I
 was
 like,
 I


don't
 think
 I
 watch
 Tanner
 that
 much,


but
 I
 guess
 I
 do.


Like,
 I
 guess
 this
 guy's
 in
 my
 rotation


somehow.


Tanner
 says,
 "Only
 if
 I
 picked
 SoFi
 in


place."
 Dude,
 Tanner,
 we're
 still
 I
 I


still
 can't
 believe
 you
 didn't
 take
 SoFi


here
 because
 it
 was
 up
 for
 grabs.
 And


I'm
 just
 saying
 loyalty
 is
 a
 thing.
 I


took
 Pounder
 and
 Hood.
 And
 at
 the
 time,


both
 were
 seen
 as
 like
 ridiculous
 picks


given
 they
 had
 still
 run
 like
 crazy.


SoFi
 hadn't
 even
 run
 that
 much.
 Where


did
 Matt
 get
 it
 at?
 Matt
 got
 it
 at
 1490.


He
 took
 your
 SoFi.


Service
 Now
 was
 Tanner's
 third
 pick.


Down
 14.


Yeah,
 Sofi
 definitely
 would
 have
 put
 him


ahead
 right
 there.


But
 22%
 this
 one
 TTD
 is
 the
 one
 that's


hurting
 him
 the
 most.
 Mellie
 is
 hurting.


Melly
 I
 think
 will
 resolve
 itself
 by


next
 year.
 Service
 Now
 I
 just
 don't
 know


enough
 about.
 TTD
 is
 just
 you
 know
 they


might
 have
 a
 fundamental
 issue
 just
 like


for
 me.
 Duolingo
 unfortunately
 might


have
 a
 fundamental
 issue
 here.
 Uh
 for


Steve
 he
 just
 has
 a
 bunch
 of
 stinkers


like
 PayPal
 dud.
 Micro
 strategy
 dud
 hims


dud.
 I
 almost
 traded
 Apple
 for
 him
 and


he
 said
 no
 and
 I
 was
 like
 all
 right
 I'm


keeping
 Apple


and
 Apple
 is
 up
 like
 40%.
 Uh
 and
 then


Netflix
 unfortunately
 dud
 Salesforce


finally
 recovering
 and
 then
 Micron
 is
 at


a
 good
 one
 at
 97%.


Tanner
 says
 I
 didn't
 think
 anyone
 would


take
 it.
 It's
 not
 about
 that
 bro.
 I


didn't
 think
 anyone
 was
 taking
 Perure


and
 Hood.
 Hood
 was
 70
 at
 the
 time.


Pounder
 was
 140
 because
 it
 was
 Ste
 Steve


was
 not
 taking
 it.
 Chris
 was
 not
 taking


it.
 I
 knew
 Tanner
 wouldn't
 take
 those.


Maybe
 Matt
 would
 have
 taken
 Palanteer,


but
 then
 again,
 I
 still
 think
 Matt
 would


have
 been
 a
 little
 hesitant,
 but
 I


didn't
 even
 want
 to
 risk
 it.


I
 didn't
 even
 want
 to
 I
 was
 like,
 "Nope,


these
 two
 are
 coming
 home
 with
 me."


And
 then
 you
 guys
 let
 me
 get
 Tesla.
 No


one
 took
 Tesla.
 They
 let
 me
 get
 Tesla
 at


329.


I
 was
 like,
 "Okay,


give
 me
 pound
 your
 hood
 in
 Tesla."


688
 on
 the
 S&P.
 Still
 not
 breaking


through
 68850.


but
 trying
 to
 hold
 on.


Hoodie
 133,
 Palunteer
 180.
 All right,
 so


let's
 see
 if
 we
 have
 any
 other
 headlines


macro-wise.
 The
 big
 thing
 of
 the
 day
 was


PCE.


Um,


SoftBank,
 we
 have
 some
 headlines
 from


them
 this
 morning.


There's
 this
 weird
 headline.
 First
 of


all,
 they're
 they're
 thinking
 of
 buying


a
 stake
 in
 Digital
 Bridge,


uh,
 which
 I
 believe
 is
 a
 public
 company.


Another
 thing
 they're
 trying
 to
 do
 is


build
 these
 like
 AI
 pseudo
 data
 centers,


industrial
 parks
 that
 are
 with
 Trump.


Let
 me
 play
 this
 real
 quick


and
 see
 this
 headline


>> wants
 to
 help
 the
 Trump
 administration


build
 out
 American
 manufacturing


capacity.
 The
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 says


that
 SoftBank
 CEO
 Masasan
 is
 working
 on


a
 plan
 under
 which
 SoftBank
 would
 help


create
 factory
 clusters
 in
 the
 United


States
 using
 hundreds
 of
 billions
 of


dollars
 pledged
 by
 the
 Japanese


government
 in
 its
 recent
 trade
 deal
 with


America.
 That
 report
 says
 that
 Trump


branded
 industrial
 parks
 would
 be
 built


on
 federal
 land
 and
 owned
 by
 the
 US


government
 once
 they're
 complete.
 The


goal
 would
 be
 for
 them
 to
 produce
 data


center
 equipment
 and
 eventually
 AI


chips.
 The
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 says
 that


President
 Trump
 has
 indicated
 that
 he's


on
 board
 with
 Masasan's
 proposal.


Andrew,


>> thanks.
 Be
 so
 an
 industrial
 park
 is
 a


planned
 area
 of
 land
 zoned
 specifically


for
 factories,
 warehouses,
 and
 other


businesses
 providing
 shared


infrastructure
 like
 roads
 and
 waste


management
 to
 centralize
 industry
 and


boost
 local
 economy.


I
 mean
 again
 this
 administration
 has


become
 so
 friendly
 and
 conducive
 to
 the


idea
 of
 making
 sure
 the
 manufacturing
 of


data
 centers
 is
 a
 real
 thing
 and
 this
 is


another
 reason
 it's
 hard
 to
 be
 bearish


Nvidia
 or
 just
 be
 bearish
 AI
 like
 this


admin
 is
 so
 aligned
 with
 making
 this


happen
 making
 this
 real


and
 you
 know
 that
 should
 result
 in
 jobs


productivity
 efficiency
 obviously
 asset


prices
 to
 do
 better
 if
 those
 companies


can
 has
 compute
 online,
 but
 they
 are


very
 geared
 to
 making
 this
 happen.


And
 so
 it
 looks
 like
 Masa
 might
 get
 into


this
 as
 well.


Yes,
 Tanner,
 join
 us
 into
 the
 stream
 as


well.
 I'll
 send
 you
 the
 link
 and
 uh


Tanner,
 you
 have
 to
 join
 the
 stream.
 I


mean,
 if
 SoFi
 actually
 gets
 in,


everyone
 is
 going
 to
 be
 wanting
 to
 hear


from
 you.
 So,
 I'll
 send
 you
 the
 link
 and


whenever
 you
 pop
 in,
 then
 we
 will
 uh


we'll
 see
 if
 SoFi
 ends
 up
 making
 it.


Okay.
 Uh
 Google.
 So,
 the
 Google
 DeepMind


head
 uh


just
 did
 an
 interview
 and
 here
 is
 him


talking
 about
 where
 their
 vision
 is
 for


Gemini.
 Let's
 play
 this
 real
 quick
 as


Google
 sustains
 above
 320
 here.


>> On
 the
 Axia
 stage,
 what
 would
 you
 say
 a


year
 from
 now?
 How
 will
 agents
 have


progressed?
 What's
 an
 example
 of
 how
 it


will
 work
 in
 everyday
 life
 a
 year
 from


now?
 Well,
 look,
 I
 we
 we
 have
 this


concept
 of
 a
 universal
 assistant
 that
 we


want
 Gemini
 eventually
 to
 become.
 Uh
 I


think
 this
 is
 also
 you're
 going to
 see


from
 us
 over
 the
 next
 year.
 This
 will
 be


on
 on
 on
 more
 devices
 as
 well.
 By


universal,
 we
 mean
 it's
 not
 just
 on
 your


computer
 or
 your
 laptop
 or
 your
 or
 your


phone,
 but
 maybe
 comes
 around
 with
 you


on
 glasses
 or
 other
 devices.
 And
 um
 I


think
 it
 need
 you
 know
 we
 want
 to
 create


something
 that
 is
 useful
 to
 you
 in
 your


everyday
 life
 that
 you
 consult
 many


times
 a
 day.
 it
 becomes
 a
 part
 of
 the


fabric
 of
 your
 life
 and
 it
 just
 improves


your
 productivity
 but
 also
 your
 personal


life
 you
 know
 recommendations
 for
 books


and
 films
 and
 other
 or
 activities
 that


you'd
 like
 and
 but
 yeah
 so
 but
 agents
 at


the
 moment
 they
 can't
 comp
 you
 can't


delegate
 to
 them
 uh
 a
 whole
 task
 and
 be


sure
 they're
 going
 to
 complete
 that


entire
 task
 uh
 uh
 completely
 reliably


>> a
 year
 from
 now
 you
 think
 they
 will


>> I
 think
 a
 year
 from
 now
 we'll
 start


having
 agents
 that
 uh
 are
 close
 uh
 to


doing
 that
 and
 bull
 case,
 bare
 case,


what
 is
 the
 best
 case
 for
 what
 AI
 can
 do


for
 the
 world?
 And
 what
 do
 you
 fear


most?


>> Well,
 look,
 the
 the
 the
 the
 the
 best


case
 scenario
 that
 that
 I've
 always


dreamed
 about
 and
 why
 I
 worked
 my
 whole


life
 on
 on
 on
 AI
 and
 you
 know,
 getting


closer
 to
 this
 moment
 we've
 been
 working


towards
 for
 decades
 now,
 many
 of
 us
 is


um
 uh
 a
 kind
 of
 I
 some
 call
 it
 radical


abundance.
 So
 this
 idea
 we
 solved
 a
 lot


of
 the
 biggest
 issues
 confronting
 uh


society
 and
 humanity
 today.
 So
 whether


that's
 free
 uh
 uh
 renewable
 clean


energy,
 maybe
 we
 solve
 fusion
 or
 better


battery
 optimal
 batteries
 and
 and
 solar


uh
 materials,
 semiconductors,
 you
 know,


material
 science.
 We've
 solved
 a
 lot
 of


diseases.
 So
 then
 we're
 in
 a
 situation


where
 you
 know
 we're
 in
 this
 new
 era


post
 scarcity
 era
 and
 we're
 potentially


you
 know
 humanity
 is
 is
 flourishing
 and


traveling
 to
 the
 stars
 and
 spreading


consciousness
 to
 the
 to
 the
 galaxy


>> and
 what
 do
 you


>> this
 was
 Sundar's
 argument
 as
 well
 uh
 on


Fox
 yesterday
 about
 the
 idea
 of
 I
 mean


data
 centers
 in
 space
 you're
 just
 seeing


a
 lot
 a
 lot
 of
 excitement
 from
 where


the
 heads
 of
 these
 AI
 companies
 are


thinking
 about
 when
 it
 comes
 to


incorporating
 these
 data
 centers.
 Again,


the
 big
 announcement
 yesterday
 as
 well


for
 those
 that
 missed
 it
 was
 Palanter


and
 Nvidia
 announcing
 Chain
 Reaction.


This
 is
 Palanter's
 new
 product
 offering.


Nvidia
 is
 a
 founding
 partner
 in
 this


offering.
 I
 got
 to
 speak
 to
 a
 lot
 of


employees
 yesterday
 around
 what
 this


partnership
 looks
 like
 and
 one
 of
 them


in
 particular
 just
 really
 explained
 it


deeply
 and
 at
 its
 core,
 they're
 talking


about
 an
 operating
 system
 specifically


to
 handle
 complex
 supply
 chains
 and


energy
 problems
 that
 come
 up
 with
 data


centers.
 And
 again,
 the
 really
 cool


thing
 about
 this
 is
 warp
 speed
 was


basically
 bringing
 the
 ontology
 and


foundry
 to
 the
 defense
 base
 and


re-industrializing
 re-industrializing


defense
 manufacturing.
 Chain
 reaction
 is


saying,
 "Hey,
 let's
 take
 the
 same


benefits
 of
 this
 AI
 operating
 system


that
 we've
 built
 over
 the
 past
 20
 years


and
 bring
 it
 to
 something
 that
 is
 at
 the


intersection
 of
 how
 to
 make
 AI
 even


real,
 which
 is
 chips
 and
 making
 them


come
 online."
 I
 think
 the
 biggest


bottleneck
 that
 Jensen's
 been
 talking


about
 a
 lot
 more
 and
 Adela
 is
 energy.


counter
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 experience
 with


dealing
 with
 energy
 infrastructure.
 PG&E


was
 one
 of
 the
 big
 ones
 that
 the
 OGs


remember
 especially
 with
 dealing
 with


wildfires.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 is
 going
 to


be
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of
 those


partnerships
 where
 if
 data
 center
 growth


like
 if
 you
 believe
 in
 Nebius
 and
 core


and
 all
 these
 like
 you
 need
 software
 to


make
 sense
 of
 building
 the
 data
 centers


and
 that's
 where
 I
 think
 that


partnership
 can
 be
 very
 very
 creative.


Uh
 here's
 the
 update
 on
 the
 white
 house


being
 skeptical
 potentially
 of
 this


Netflix
 deal.
 a
 lot
 of
 reports
 that
 said


the
 White
 House
 wanted
 Paramount
 to
 get


it
 based
 on
 the
 Larry
 Ellison
 ties,
 but


it
 seems
 like
 Netflix
 has
 won
 the
 bid.


>> Ellison's
 father
 talked
 a
 bit
 about


that,
 too.


>> Yeah,
 Carl,
 we're
 getting
 some
 news


here.
 Our
 first
 reaction
 now
 from
 the


administration.
 I
 was
 just
 in
 contact


moments
 ago
 with
 a
 senior
 administration


official
 who
 tells
 me
 that
 the


administration's
 view
 of
 this
 deal
 can


be
 characterized
 as
 heavy
 skepticism.


So,
 uh,
 no
 word
 from
 the
 president
 yet.


We'll
 watch
 Truth
 Social.
 But
 that
 word


from
 a
 senior
 official,
 senior


administration
 official
 to
 me
 just


moments
 ago
 saying
 they
 view
 this
 deal


with
 heavy
 skepticism.
 I
 think
 that's


what
 we
 could
 have
 expected
 uh
 from
 this


deal.
 You
 know,
 the
 general
 view
 at
 the


White
 House
 of
 uh
 Netflix
 is,
 you
 know,


sort
 of
 it's
 an
 Obama
 uh
 entity
 because


of
 that
 deal
 that
 they
 did
 with
 the


Obama
 family.
 They
 wanted
 the
 Ellison
 to


>> what


the
 general
 view
 of
 the
 White
 House
 is


that
 Netflix
 is
 an
 Obama
 entity
 because


they


did
 a
 deal
 with
 O


did
 he
 what
 expected
 uh
 from
 this
 deal


you
 know
 the
 general
 view
 at
 the
 White


House
 of
 uh
 Netflix
 is
 you
 know
 sort
 of


it's
 an
 Obama
 uh
 entity
 because
 of
 that


deal
 that
 they
 did
 with
 the
 Obama
 family


they
 wanted
 the
 Ellison's
 to
 be
 involved


here
 that's
 not


>> I'm
 just
 hoping
 that's
 horrible


reporting
 not
 the
 truth
 because
 that
 is


very
 weird


>> contemplated
 under
 the
 current
 deal


structure.
 So
 I
 think
 we
 can
 start
 to


expect
 some
 potential
 opposition
 from


the
 administration.
 How
 that
 shakes
 out


though
 is
 not
 necessarily
 clear.
 Let
 me


run
 through
 real
 quick
 Carl
 the
 antirust


process
 here
 and
 you'll
 just
 see
 why
 the


deck
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 stacked
 in
 favor
 of


the
 administration
 here.
 The
 first
 thing


that
 has
 to
 happen
 is
 what
 they
 call
 an


HSR
 filing.
 That
 means
 that
 the
 entities


that
 are
 engaged
 in
 this
 deal
 have
 to


file
 a
 Hartcott
 Rhodino
 filing
 laying


out
 the
 deal
 to
 the
 Department
 of


Justice.
 Uh
 that
 is
 expected
 to
 be
 the


very
 first
 sort
 of
 piece
 of
 paper
 here.


Uh
 and
 then
 there's
 a
 process
 that
 has


to
 run.
 There's
 a
 30-day
 initial
 review


to
 get
 to
 a
 decision
 about
 what
 they


call
 extended
 review.
 It's
 almost


guaranteed
 in
 this
 case
 that
 you
 would


have
 an
 extended
 review
 by
 the


Department
 of
 Justice.
 So
 to
 slow
 this


deal
 down,
 uh
 what
 sort
 of
 experts
 in


Washington
 are
 saying
 is
 all
 the
 Trump


administration
 really
 has
 to
 do
 is
 sit


on
 its
 hands
 uh
 as
 it
 evaluates
 that
 and


conducts
 the
 extended
 review,
 gets


documents,
 gets
 internal
 information,


market
 share,
 all
 of
 that
 uh
 will
 be


gathered
 over
 the
 course
 of
 maybe
 a


year.
 So
 this
 becomes
 a
 very
 extended


process
 uh
 internally
 at
 the
 Department


of
 Justice.
 Externally,
 you
 know,
 this


is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 massive
 clash
 of
 clans.


It's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 political
 battle


uh
 between
 all
 of
 the
 different
 sides


here.
 You've
 got
 traditional
 old


Hollywood
 that
 doesn't
 like
 this
 deal.


You've
 got
 the
 Ellison's
 out
 there


deciding
 what
 they
 want
 to
 do.
 You've


got
 the
 Trump
 administration
 deciding


how
 they
 want
 to
 play
 it.
 But
 you've


also
 got
 uh
 actors.
 You've
 got
 state


attorney
 generals
 uh
 who
 are
 going
 to


look
 at
 this
 from
 a
 consumer


perspective.
 So
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 clans


out
 there.
 And
 right
 now
 everybody
 in


Washington
 is
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 who


is
 on
 what
 side
 of
 that
 line.
 How
 do
 we


build
 build
 coalitions
 with
 the
 other


people
 that
 we
 might
 not
 see
 eye
 to
 eye


with
 ideologically
 who
 end
 up
 on
 our


side
 of
 the
 line
 to
 fight
 this
 thing?


So,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 long
 and


intense
 battle,
 but
 the
 first
 thing


you're
 going
 to
 see
 is
 that
 HSR
 pilot.


>> Aean,
 when
 you
 were
 saying
 the
 heavy


skepticism,
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 sure
 it's
 not


lost
 on
 the
 administration
 that
 the


co-founder
 of
 Netflix,
 Reed
 Hastings,


has
 been
 very
 anti-Trump.
 Um,
 has
 put
 a


a
 lot
 of
 money
 where
 his
 mouth
 is.
 most


recently
 backed
 Governor
 Nuomo
 in
 the


redistricting
 to
 redraw
 the
 House
 map


and
 in
 the
 in
 the
 sort
 of
 stop
 Trump


movement.
 That
 has
 to


>> that
 would
 be
 okay.
 That
 one
 makes
 more


sense
 than
 the
 Obama
 thing.
 The
 Obama


thing
 was
 just
 weird.
 But
 yes,
 Reed


Hastings,
 founder
 of
 Netflix,
 very


anti-Trump.


Uh
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that
 necessarily


stops
 the
 deal,
 but
 maybe
 that


influences
 how
 Trump
 thinks
 of
 giving


them
 this
 this
 acquisition.
 play
 that


has
 to
 play
 a
 role
 even
 if
 it's
 not


supposed
 to.


>> Yeah.
 And
 you
 just
 heard
 Treasury


Secretary
 Bessant,
 you
 know,
 on
 stage


with
 our
 Andrew
 Ross
 Sorcin
 at
 the


Dealbook
 Conference
 invoked,
 uh,
 the


Netflix
 deal
 with
 the
 Obamas
 on
 stage
 to


sort
 of
 mock
 the
 sort
 of
 politicization


of
 some
 of
 these
 networks,
 right?
 So,


uh,
 Netflix
 is
 not
 favorably
 viewed


within
 this
 administration.
 And
 as
 as


you
 say,
 I'm
 now
 being
 told
 by
 a
 senior


administration
 official,
 the
 first
 blush


reaction
 that
 we
 are
 getting
 is
 heavy


skepticism.
 So,
 how
 does
 that


materialize?
 I
 think
 in
 the
 Department


of
 Justice
 antirust
 process,
 but
 I
 think


if
 President
 Trump,
 you
 know,
 wants
 to


flex
 here,
 and
 he
 often
 does,
 uh,
 there


are
 a
 whole
 host
 of
 other
 elements
 of


executive
 power
 that
 he
 could
 bring
 to


bear,
 uh,
 in
 a
 way
 that
 we
 just


typically
 wouldn't
 see
 in
 a
 normal


administration
 to
 put
 quote
 marks
 around


the
 word
 normal
 there.
 Uh,
 this


president,
 you
 know,
 is
 a
 maximalist
 in


terms
 of
 his
 interpretation
 of
 executive


power.
 I
 think
 well
 the
 question
 use
 all


the


>> the
 question
 David
 would
 be
 whether
 or


not
 that
 scenario
 clouds
 this
 view
 in


corporate
 boardrooms
 that
 we
 somehow


have
 entered
 a
 new
 reign
 of
 M&A
 Nirvana


where
 deals
 are
 allowed.
 I
 mean
 I
 guess


in
 this
 case
 though
 unless
 some
 of
 your


political
 past
 runs
 a
 foul
 of
 certain


people
 in
 the
 White
 House.


>> Yeah.
 Listen,
 Carl,
 when
 we've
 been,
 you


know,
 as
 long
 as
 this
 is
 auction's
 been


going
 on,
 we've
 been
 having
 the


conversation
 at
 the
 desk
 uh
 about
 um
 how


different
 this
 is
 because
 it's
 really
 a


one
 man
 and
 and
 conceivably
 what
 he


wants
 in
 particular.
 Uh
 and
 there
 that's


no
 different
 here.
 I
 think
 the
 things


that
 were
 raised
 just
 now
 um
 uh
 the


timeline
 raised
 by
 Aean
 is
 is


appropriate.


>> Look,
 if
 it
 doesn't
 happen,
 Netflix
 is


out
 of
 $6
 billion.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 what


the
 Trump
 administration
 is
 going
 to
 do


here.
 It's
 probably
 going
 to
 take
 a


while
 to
 figure
 out.
 Netflix
 green
 on


the
 day
 right
 now
 103.
 But
 if
 the
 deal


doesn't
 go
 through


six
 billion
 down
 the
 toilet.


So
 I
 guess
 we're
 going
 to
 see.
 I
 I
 think


this
 is
 going
 to
 take
 a
 while
 though.
 So


for
 those
 that
 are
 kind
 of
 getting
 into


Netflix
 just
 for
 this,
 I
 don't
 think


there's
 any
 resolution.
 This
 thing
 could


go
 back
 down
 below
 100.
 It
 could
 go
 up


to
 110.
 Could
 be
 stuck
 in
 this.
 Like
 if


anything,
 if
 anything,
 it
 might
 end
 up


creating
 an
 overhang
 for
 the
 stock
 for


the
 next
 year.


That's
 another
 perspective
 to
 think


about
 because
 if
 this
 is
 constantly


over
 the
 narrative
 of
 the
 stock
 is
 like


will
 they
 acquire
 and
 this
 is
 not
 just


like
 some
 rinky
 dinky
 little


acquisition.
 This
 is
 like
 changes
 the


entire
 trajectory
 of
 the
 company.


So
 it
 is
 something
 to
 think
 about
 if


this
 is
 a
 2026
 narrative
 that
 Netflix


has
 to


deal
 with
 the
 whole
 time.
 I
 kind
 of


still
 think
 the
 deal
 goes
 through


though.
 Do
 you
 really
 do
 you
 really


think
 Trump
 is
 going
 to
 cancel
 it
 cuz


he
 he
 thinks
 Netflix
 is
 tight
 with
 the


Obamas
 and
 that
 Reed
 Hastings
 likes


Gavin
 Newsome?
 Dualingo,
 by
 the
 way,


just
 hitting
 200.


Like,
 do
 we
 really
 think
 the


administration
 just
 says,
 "Nope,
 we're


not
 going
 to
 let
 it
 happen
 because
 of


that."


I
 mean,
 maybe.
 That's
 a
 good
 poll


question.
 Let's
 do
 that.
 That'll
 be
 our


last
 poll
 of
 the
 day
 and
 then
 we'll
 be


done.
 Let's
 ask
 that
 question.
 Other


than
 that
 guys,
 nothing
 else
 crazy


happening
 in
 the
 markets.
 PCE
 was
 the


big
 news.
 We
 got
 done
 with
 that.
 S&P,


I'll
 be
 live
 after
 the
 close
 there.
 But


besides
 that,
 nothing
 else
 too
 crazy.


Would
 Trump
 block
 the
 Netflix
 deal?
 He


doesn't
 get
 to
 literally
 make
 that


executive
 decision.
 But
 as
 as
 uh
 as
 Aean


was
 saying,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 different


things
 they
 can
 do
 to
 just
 stall
 it
 from


happening
 or
 make
 it
 tough
 to
 get
 it
 to


go
 through,
 which
 would
 give
 them
 more


time
 to
 think
 of
 different
 ideas
 and


concepts
 of


it
 taking
 place.


I
 just
 don't
 know
 if
 he
 would
 really


put
 that
 much
 energy
 into
 not
 making


this
 happen.


Like


he
 could
 direct
 the
 FTC
 to
 investigate.


I
 mean
 theor
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 biggest


thing
 Trump
 could
 do.
 He
 could
 just
 tell


the
 FTC
 to
 like
 shut
 it
 down
 and
 like


work
 really
 hard
 to
 make
 sure
 it's
 not


seen
 as
 a
 meaningful
 deal.


S&P
 right
 there
 68780.
 Not
 really


getting
 to
 that
 alltime
 high
 yet.
 We're


going
 to
 see
 if
 this
 can
 end
 up
 bounce


bouncing
 towards


690.


Nvidia
 is
 just
 stuck,
 bro.
 Every
 time
 it


gets
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 momentum
 gets


stuck.
 We
 haven't
 had
 that
 breakout


since
 the
 earnings
 and
 then
 it
 got


dumped
 the
 day
 after
 earnings.


But
 I'm
 not
 complaining
 at
 180.
 I
 mean,


this
 was
 my
 price
 target
 for
 the
 year.


180
 was
 actually
 now
 that
 the
 EPS
 growth


is
 just
 so
 much
 higher.
 I'm
 like,
 you


know,
 195
 should
 be
 closer
 to
 where
 it


should
 be.


They
 got
 Palenteer
 back
 to
 180.
 Uh
 Amcor


holding
 on
 to
 the
 43s.
 Tesla
 trying
 to


get
 back
 to
 460
 right
 here,
 which
 is


very
 nice
 to
 see
 Tesla
 holding
 on
 to


that
 level.


And
 with
 all
 the
 [ __ ]
 we
 went
 through
 in


November,
 the
 S&P
 is
 less
 than
 $2
 away


from
 alltime
 highs.


This
 is
 why
 it's
 hard
 to
 sell,
 bro.
 It's


like
 selling
 is
 not
 like
 we're
 talking


about
 sell.
 I
 mean,
 the
 how
 many
 people


were
 saying,
 "Get
 out
 of
 the
 markets.


It's
 done.
 We're
 cooked.
 Sell


everything."


It
 sounds
 smart
 to
 say
 that
 stuff,
 but


it's
 not
 easy.


Like,
 as
 bad
 as
 it
 felt
 two
 weeks
 ago


where
 you
 really
 wanted
 to
 just
 like
 get


out
 and
 say,
 "I'm
 done
 with
 this
 game."


When
 do
 you
 get
 back
 in?
 You
 don't
 know.


Because
 once
 you
 get
 out,
 it's
 hard
 to


get
 back
 in,
 especially
 if
 you
 bought


these
 stocks
 months
 ago.


And
 that's
 why
 the
 the
 permabull
 thesis


is
 not
 even
 like,
 oh,
 you're
 always


bullish.
 It's
 just
 like
 you
 have
 no


other
 option
 unless
 you're
 like
 an


expert
 at
 timing
 the
 markets
 and
 day


trading
 to
 be
 bullish.
 Like,
 yeah,
 you


might
 not
 have
 to
 deploy
 capital
 all
 the


time
 on
 dips.
 So
 you
 can
 make
 strategic


decisions,
 but
 long
 term,


what
 other
 choice
 do
 you
 have


other
 than
 believing
 that
 the
 American


economy
 will
 thrive
 and
 that
 you,
 you


know,
 might
 not
 have
 the
 best
 way
 to


time
 it?
 So
 that
 you've
 got
 to
 be
 in
 the


in
 the
 economy
 to
 participate
 in
 the


upside
 of
 it.


>> It's
 not
 the
 easiest.


Is
 not
 the
 easiest.
 Yes.
 After
 the


close,
 S&P
 will
 be
 rebalancing.
 What


companies
 does
 anyone
 have
 the
 list?
 Let


me
 see.
 What
 companies
 are
 eligible
 for


S&P
 500?
 We
 know
 SoFi.
 We
 know
 Reddit,


but
 I
 don't
 see
 what
 other
 companies


are
 out
 there
 as
 well.
 There's
 a
 couple


energy
 companies
 that
 didn't
 make
 it


last
 time
 that
 could
 get.
 Last
 time
 it


was
 Apploven
 and
 Hood
 and
 then
 another


company
 that


I
 think
 we
 all
 forgot
 about
 because
 no


one
 cared
 other
 than
 Apploving
 and
 Hood.


Figma
 can't
 get
 in.
 They
 just
 went


public.
 Dude,
 Micro
 Strategy
 is
 not


getting
 in.
 Sorry,
 but
 Micro
 Tragy
 is


not
 going
 to
 get
 like
 I'll
 eat
 my
 words


if
 I'm
 wrong
 here,
 but
 I
 don't
 know
 if


the
 committee
 is
 going
 to
 easily
 want


this
 Bitcoin
 treasury
 to
 be
 part
 of
 it.


Like
 eventually
 they
 probably
 have
 to


get
 in,
 but


I
 think
 that's
 when
 like
 Bitcoin
 really


goes
 up
 and
 the
 committee
 is
 a
 little


bit
 more
 uh
 I
 guess
 like
 warm
 to
 the


idea
 of
 it.
 When
 Bitcoin's
 as
 volatile


as
 it
 is,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 they
 easily


say,
 "Yeah,
 let's
 throw
 it
 in
 there.


I
 mean,
 they
 already
 have
 some
 crypto


companies,
 including
 Coinbase
 in
 there.


687


on
 the
 S&P."
 Okay,
 here's
 the
 list.


SoFi,
 Reddit,
 Viv,
 Oh,
 Viv
 could
 have


got
 in
 last
 time.
 Pure
 Storage,
 Zoom,


Zoom's
 eligible.
 Okay,
 Alab,
 that
 would


be
 a
 big
 one.
 Micro
 Strategy,
 obviously.


VRT,
 that
 would
 also
 be
 a
 big
 one.
 And


then
 affirm,


which
 would
 also


be
 a
 big
 one,
 too.


I
 say
 this
 as
 my
 camera
 has
 officially


died.
 All
 right,
 so
 that
 is
 it
 for
 me.


Let's
 do
 word
 of
 the
 day
 and
 then
 we'll


be
 out
 of
 here.
 I'll
 be
 back
 on
 the


close.
 We'll
 have
 Steve
 join
 me.
 We'll


have
 Tanner
 join
 right
 before
 the


announcement.
 5:15


5:15
 p.m.
 Eastern
 is
 when
 the


announcement
 will
 come
 out.


So,
 please
 just
 remember
 that
 is
 if
 you


if
 you
 only
 want
 to
 show
 up
 for
 the


announcement,
 you
 can
 show
 up
 at
 like


510
 and
 we
 should
 get
 the
 numbers


literally
 at
 5:15.


All right,
 word
 of
 the
 day
 is
 cantilian


refers
 to
 the
 idea
 that
 newly
 created


money
 benefits
 those
 who
 receive
 it


first
 before
 prices
 adjust,
 meaning


monetary
 expansion
 has
 distributional


consequences,
 not
 just
 inflationary


ones.


I
 think
 this
 is
 actually
 a
 good
 word


going
 into
 next
 week.
 When
 the
 Fed


injects
 liquidity,
 the
 cantillian
 effect


kicks
 in.
 Asset
 holders
 get
 the
 upside


long
 before
 wage
 earners
 feel
 anything.


Wow.


That's
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 word.


That
 is
 I
 think
 we'll
 actually
 use
 that.


I
 mean,
 we've
 been
 talking
 about


something
 like
 that
 for
 a
 while.
 So,
 new


money
 creates
 benefits
 to
 those
 who


receive
 it
 first
 before
 prices
 adjust,


creating
 distribution
 consequences,


which
 is
 a
 cantillian
 effect.


I
 mean,
 yeah,
 if
 the
 Fed
 injects


liquidity,
 stocks
 go
 up
 before
 the


average
 American
 would
 feel
 the
 benefits


of
 that
 liquidity,
 which
 is,
 you
 know,


the
 benefit
 of
 being
 a
 an
 asset
 holder.


All
 right,
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 That's


the
 word
 of
 the
 day.
 Thank
 you
 everybody


for
 being
 here.
 David,
 thank you
 for
 the


super
 chat.
 Silver
 is
 at
 an
 all-time


high.
 Congratulations
 to
 those
 that
 uh


are
 in
 silver.
 I
 will
 be
 back
 on
 the


close.
 We're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 this
 ends


up
 playing
 out.
 Um,


but
 I
 mean,
 look,
 overall
 it's
 a
 good


week.
 I
 don't
 think
 any
 of
 us
 can
 be


upset
 about
 this
 week.
 S&P
 500
 so
 far


for
 the
 week
 is
 up
 1.25%
 to
 start
 off


December.
 December
 averages
 1.5%
 for
 the


month.
 So,
 the
 fact
 that
 it's
 up
 1%
 in


the
 past
 five
 days
 is
 bullish.
 That
 also


means
 we
 have
 to
 be
 a
 little
 cautious


going
 into
 next
 week.
 But,
 we
 can
 break


through
 that
 all-time
 high,
 get
 the
 Fed


cuts,
 earnings
 continue
 to
 be
 strong.
 We


have
 a
 bunch
 of
 earnings
 next
 week


and
 this
 consumer
 is
 weak
 narrative
 is


challenged
 then
 you
 know
 maybe
 that


really
 does
 continue
 into
 some
 more


excitement
 and
 momentum.


Check
 pronunciation.


Dude,
 there's
 no
 way
 I
 said
 it
 wrong.


It's
 Cantilian.


I'm
 pretty
 sure
 you
 guys
 said
 it
 the


same
 way
 I
 did.
 Cantilian.


All right.


Why
 do
 I
 not
 see
 it?
 Okay,
 here
 it
 is.


Is
 it
 spelled
 the
 same?
 C
 A
 N
 T
 I.
 Okay.


All right.
 I'm
 saying
 Cantilian.
 This


[ __ ]
 better
 not
 be
 wrong.


>> Cantalon.


>> Dude,
 no
 one
 saw
 this
 word
 and
 said


Cantalon.


No.
 Absolutely
 no
 one
 saw
 this
 and
 said


Cantalon.


It's
 can
 like


in
 what
 world
 did
 you
 see
 that
 and
 say


can
 cantalon.


It's
 cantilian.


Although
 now
 that
 I'm
 looking
 at
 the


spelling,
 it
 should
 be
 l
 i
 o
 n
 for
 the


eon
 sound.
 This
 is
 actually


more
 like
 a
 threecllable
 word
 that
 ends


in
 on
 versus
 eon.


But
 still,


>> Cantalon,


>> apparently
 another
 definition
 is
 it's
 a


brewery.


Okay,
 whatever.
 I'm
 going
 to
 keep
 saying


Cantilian.


I'm
 going
 to
 keep
 saying
 Cantilian.


Cantillian
 sounds
 better
 than
 Cantalon,


dude.
 Cantalon
 sounds
 like
 some


I
 don't
 know,
 some
 like
 crappy
 like


cigarette
 brand.
 Cantillian
 sounds
 like


a
 finance
 word.


It's
 like,
 oh,
 did
 you
 did
 you
 look
 at


the
 cantillian
 from
 the
 Fed?
 That
 just


sounds
 better.
 All right,
 that's
 it
 for


me.
 Thank
 everybody.
 Appreciate
 you
 all.


I
 will
 see
 you
 guys
 on
 the
 market
 close.


We'll
 have
 S&P
 inclusion
 and
 we'll
 keep


seeing
 if
 the
 S&P
 can
 break
 through


these
 all-time
 highs.
 Bye
 everybody.
 See


you
 guys
 on
 the
 close.
