Do you ever wonder who you are
beyond your job, your titles,
your accomplishments?
This is the question
I was forced to confront
when the company I'd spent a decade
pouring my soul into shut down.
My work had been my entire identity,
and without it,
I didn't know who I was anymore.
Ten years earlier,
I had co-founded Embrace,
a social enterprise that created
a low-cost portable incubator
for premature babies
in underserved communities.
Our technology could work
without constant electricity,
making it usable
in remote parts of the world.
We set an audacious goal:
to save a million babies.
I moved to India,
where over 20 percent of all
the world's premature babies are born,
and I made that mission my life.
Over the years,
we saved thousands of babies.
Babies like Nathan,
who was abandoned on a street
weighing just two and a half pounds.
He was rescued by an orphanage
and kept inside our incubator for weeks.
He survived.
Seven months later,
I visited the orphanage
and I held him in my arms.
A few months after that,
he was adopted by a family in Chicago.
Stories like this kept me going.
Along the way, we were recognized
by President Obama
and funded by Beyonce.
(Cheers)
(Laughter)
Our work was featured in headlines
all over the world.
On the outside, it looked
like a success story.
But the truth was, on the inside,
I felt like I was drowning in stress,
exhaustion, self-doubt.
The work weighed so heavily on me,
there were moments I felt
like I could barely breathe.
Ten years in,
after countless setbacks
from manufacturing to distribution
to funding challenges,
we had to shut down the company.
I failed.
I hit the lowest point of my life.
I was having panic attacks,
I was depressed, I couldn't sleep,
I felt completely broken
in mind, body and spirit.
So I decided to set off
on a healing journey.
I packed a surfboard and a suitcase,
and I bought a one-way
ticket to Indonesia,
where I threw myself into healing
with the same intensity
I'd once poured into my company.
I was willing to do anything
because this was a matter of survival.
I was going to heal
the shit out of myself.
(Laughter)
I meditated for days in silence
in the jungle until I hallucinated.
Although I'm pretty sure
those cockroaches on steroids were real.
(Laughter)
I did psychedelic journeys.
I dove with sharks
so I could learn to relax.
I don't know why I couldn't just
get a massage like a normal person.
(Laughter)
I burned holes in my leg
for a frog poison ceremony.
It was supposed to purge my past.
Instead, I think I purged everything
I'd ever eaten in my entire life.
(Laughter)
But the real breakthroughs came only
when I began to confront my childhood.
Growing up, my father showed his love
by pushing me to excel.
I remember in second grade,
on weekend mornings,
I would cuddle with him
and he would warm my cold feet under his
as he quizzed me on my times tables.
Thanks to those drills,
I won all the math
competitions in my class.
When I didn't meet his expectations,
I was punished.
Violently.
When I was 12 years old,
I came home from school one day
and I decided to read my history book
on the front lawn.
It was a beautiful sunny day.
When my father came home and saw this,
he flew into a rage.
He decided homework
shouldn't be done on a lawn,
it should be done at a desk.
And so he beat me.
And he demanded that I apologize.
I refused because
for the first time in my life,
I knew I had done nothing wrong.
I also knew I was utterly powerless.
As I did this healing work,
I finally connected the dots.
Feeling so powerless
throughout my childhood
had driven me to help
the most powerless people in the world.
My pain had become my purpose.
But it had also become my shadow.
No matter how many babies I saved
or how much recognition I received,
I never felt like I was enough.
Sometimes our trauma
gets channeled into drive,
perfectionism, overwork.
Some people numb their pain
with substances.
I numbed mine with productivity.
I cared deeply about my work,
but I also believe that my worth
depended on what I achieved.
I finally stopped trying
to achieve my way out of pain.
Here's how I found my way back to myself.
First, I slowed down
and I just let myself feel.
For most of my life, I had disconnected
from my emotions to survive.
Research shows most of us do this.
We avoid painful emotions
through working, drinking, social media
and other endless distractions.
But when we suppress our emotions,
they don't go away.
They actually resurface more intensely,
often as anxiety, depression or burnout.
So I let myself feel it all.
I got really comfortable
with being uncomfortable.
I sobbed until I had no more tears left.
I trembled with fear.
I raged with anger.
I learned you can't think
your way out of pain.
You can't work your way out of it.
You have to feel your way through it.
Second, I learned to let go of outcomes.
Everything is constantly changing.
The only thing that is certain
is uncertainty.
Nothing teaches me
this lesson more viscerally
than being in the ocean,
where my conditions are changing
moment to moment,
based on the winds, the tides, the swells.
Because of this,
it's so important to be present
and to not be attached to anything,
including outcomes.
I realized I'd become so attached
to an outcome for Embrace
that I pushed past all my limits,
and when the company failed,
it shattered my sense of self.
I now know I'm not defined
by my external successes or failures.
It's who I am on the inside
that truly matters.
Am I acting with love?
Am I growing?
Am I giving to others?
I can't control the waves,
but I can choose how I want to ride them.
And lastly, I learned self-compassion.
I did this through recognizing
all the different parts of myself.
The warrior who had fought every battle.
One of my exes nicknamed
this part of me “Jane-ghis” Khan.
(Laughter)
The overachiever who had pushed me
to work past exhaustion.
I discovered the part
they were protecting,
the little girl inside me
who was so scared
that she wasn't enough.
For so long, I wanted everyone else
to show her that she was worthy.
It never worked.
So I finally turned towards her
and I finally said the things
that she had always needed to hear.
I'm so sorry.
You didn't deserve that.
You are enough
and you are loved.
And she believed me.
I now know resilience
isn't about toughness.
It's about tenderness.
It's about treating
ourselves with compassion
and knowing deep in our bones
that we are enough just as we are,
beyond our achievements
or even our purpose.
I once thought
healing meant fixing myself.
Now I know it means loving myself.
And this is so important
because the relationship
we have with ourselves
shapes every other
relationship in our lives,
both personally and professionally.
In a miraculous turn of events,
Embrace was saved.
As of this year, it's impacted
over a million babies.
(Applause and cheers)
I'm so proud of this accomplishment,
but what I'm most proud of
is learning to embrace myself.
Thank you.
(Applause)
