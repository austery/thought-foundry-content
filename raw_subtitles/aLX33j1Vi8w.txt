Brendan Sweeney is the managing
director of the Trillium Network
for Advanced Manufacturing.
How are you doing, Brendan?
>> I'm doing great.
>> All right, so give us the lay
of the land here.
How many companies across Canada
are already involved in the
defence manufacturing sector?
And how many could transition if
the call is made out.
>> Based on a directory, a
capability directory that we're
building.
We have right now more than 1200
manufacturers across Canada, and
I think about 640 of them are
located in Ontario.
And I mean, it's a really
exciting when we put this all
together and we can just kind of
map it out provincially, map it
out nationally.
There's a lot of great insights
that we're gleaning around who
these companies are, what they
do and what they could do.
Once we learn a bit more about
the defence industrial strategy
and what's going to be asked of.
>> Them when we talk about the
Ontario, I think a lot of people
were here in Toronto Midtown,
but we're just like York Region
just north of us has a pretty
good concentration of a lot of
these companies as well.
Correct?
>> Yeah.
We found in York Region alone
more than 80 companies that that
kind of validated defence sector
suppliers, plus another 55 or 60
that we kind of ranked as a high
potential to pivot or
transition.
There's also York Region,
absolutely shout out York
region.
But in the city of Toronto
proper, in Peel Region, in
London, in Waterloo and
especially in Ottawa, there are
substantial concentrations of
defence sector suppliers.
>> Give us a sense here.
What defence products or parts
here in Ontario?
Of course we like our parts.
What are we.
What's already being made here
in Canada.
>> So the largest and probably
most substantial component or
segment is aerospace.
And in many cases it is third or
fourth tier aerospace suppliers.
And we have some particular
strengths in landing gear and
landing gear components.
In in southern Ontario, if you
go closer to the London area,
you have land systems and you
have a network of suppliers to
General Dynamics Land Systems
Canada.
And then in Ottawa, in Waterloo
and in parts of York Region, you
have some really, really
interesting capabilities related
to defence sector electronics
and satellites.
And then of course Brampton,
Ontario, MDA, which is
manufacturing satellites and
robotics for space applications,
both defence and civilian or
civilian and defence, however
you want to look at it.
>> All right.
So when we look at that
landscape, it doesn't seem like
a shortage when we look at
companies.
But when we talk about defence,
one of the things that we've had
conversations about is in the
gap in skilled trades.
So I want to have an
understanding if more Canadian
companies do transition to
making more defence products,
are there enough skilled or
highly educated technical
workers to fill those roles?
>> There might be.
We certainly have the capability
to train those people.
There are probably two places
where we'd really want to think
long and hard about investing
in.
If we want to expand our defence
capabilities, a lot of these
companies that are involved in
the defence sector in Ontario
make things out of metal, right?
That means a lot of machining
and welding.
Those are two very important
skilled trades.
And so that means we're probably
going to need to develop more
machinists and more welders.
And we know for with some
certainty that General Dynamics
and companies that are making
land systems, vehicles, they're
going to need welders.
Okay.
At the same time, we probably
need to train more electrical
engineers if we want to support
an electronic products
manufacturing industry.
We used to have a much larger
electronics industry in Ontario.
And you think Nortel, you think
BlackBerry.
And we still have some, but it's
very specialised niche
capabilities, many of which are
related to defence.
>> All right.
Let's talk auto plants.
I'm going to do a little bit of
a history lesson here.
I know this is your background
here as well.
They used to play a key role in
defence production because you
could retool say to build tanks.
For example, if you go back to a
World War II, is it still true
today?
Can we do that?
Can we pivot as quickly to, you
know, move over from auto
manufacturing to something like
a tank?
>> Maybe.
Probably not.
This is probably a longer
process of transition, and it
might not even need to be
transition.
It might be two things happening
at once.
We're going to support the
automotive industry, and we're
going to sustain and grow the
automotive industry.
And then we're going to support
incumbent defence sector
manufacturers, and we're going
to grow that to.
There is some relationship
between the automotive industry
and the defence sector, but it
tends to be at lower tiers in
the supply chain.
So it's not necessarily the
Magnas of the world or the
Multimatic of the world that are
really clamouring to get into
the defence sector.
It is third and fourth tier
suppliers who for the most part
are not recognisable as
automotive parts suppliers, but
they supply the automotive
industry, they supply the
defence sector, they might even
supply aerospace where there's
some very, very strong linkages
between defence and
manufacturing is in the
aerospace sector.
Virtually every aerospace
manufacturer in Ontario is
doing, has done or is capable of
doing defence sector work.
They're making a landing gear
strut and one day it could go to
Bombardier or to Havilland, the
next day it could go to
Lockheed.
>> Okay, as of the taping of
this show right now, Canadian
manufacturers are still waiting
for the release of a fairly
important document to kind of
give them.
You talk about long term.
We're talking about a plan.
We need a bit of a strategy.
So we're waiting for the federal
defence industrial policy.
Why is that important strategy
document for companies who are
already involved in the sector,
but those who might be looking
for an opportunity here?
>> I think the at the foundation
of it, it's going to signal
where we're going to be
directing resources, I.e.
which segments.
You know, we've identified six
core segments of defence: land,
aircraft, marine, space, C4,
ISR, and ordnance.
And so we're going to say, oh,
is this a real aerospace play, a
marine play.
Is it going to be regionalised.
So getting some sense of where
the resources are going to be
directed and what the timeline
is?
Okay, I don't think this is a 1
to 2 year project.
So the nice thing is it should
give some companies, especially
at lower tiers, time to tool up,
time to time to figure out their
their scaling or their growth
plan or time to transition.
>> I was going to say the a lot
of the manufacturers have been
waiting.
I know the federal government
had promised around December of
last year that they would get
this policy, but they're still
waiting.
You've had consultations with
the Department of National
Defence about Canada's defence
manufacturing base.
Help us understand what
questions does the government
have about the sector's
capabilities and potential?
>> I think exactly the work that
we're doing, they want to
understand at a really, really
minute level of detail exactly
what we can do.
And again, we're doing this with
public information.
We're bootstrapping it at this
point in time.
And it's we're at a point now
where we can run some analysis
on this and really dig deep and
learn about who these companies
are.
A lot of them, this is really
interesting.
A lot of them, compared to other
industries, are Canadian owned,
small and medium sized
enterprises.
So it really does align nicely
with a lot of economic
development and investment and,
you know, nation building
priorities because we can engage
Canadian companies in this
process.
It's useful to have input from
companies from Japan and Germany
and Sweden, you know, who with
which we trade.
But it's really important to
grow smaller Canadian companies
who many of whom have found
really, really interesting
niches.
>> Speaking of useful, this was
very useful.
Brendan, thank you very much.
Really appreciate your time on
the program.
>> Thank you.
