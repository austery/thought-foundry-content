The idea of software companies value
lying in being a scapegoat,
essentially, for when things go wrong
is, kind of funny and dystopian.
I think in many ways. Yeah.
I mean, I think,
you know, it's a real fear, right?
And the way I think about it is there are
two arguments against software right now.
One is
the world is going to stay the same,
but software
just going to get a lot cheaper over time
now that it's cheaper to build.
And I think there's no one who would argue
that it's not gotten dramatically cheaper
to build
for reasons that we laid out in our deck,
and we can talk through it more.
We don't buy that argument.
I don't buy that argument.
But the second is
the world's about to get really weird,
and the way that knowledge work
happens is going to change.
And if we think out three or 4 or 5 years,
who knows
if there will even be customer support
reps or sales reps or software engineers?
And I think that's what's causing the kind
of hit to the share prices lately.
Hello and
welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots
podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal and I'm Tracy Alloway.
Tracy, we're recording this February 11th
and IGV,
the software ETF down another 3% today.
It has been ugly in software.
Everyone's
throwing around the term SaaSpocalypse.
I mean, the great thing about SaaS is
there are a lot of things that like, rhyme
with it, a lot of homonyms.
So you can you can make all those puns.
Saas Crash.
Yeah, exactly. SaaS is trash. Whatever.
But I'm looking at the,
the share price of Salesforce.
Oh yeah.
In particular
because I always think of Salesforce
as sort of like emblematic
the poster child. Yeah.
Poster child of like a software company
that I'm not really sure what they do.
But yeah, it's it's just ugly.
It's basically been cut in half, hasn't
it, since its peak, like in early 2025.
Right now it's 184, 84.
And it's all your fault, Joe.
It's all my fault.
That's right.
Because, earlier in the year,
after we got back from,
Christmas vacation or Christmas break,
you know, around that, I seen everyone
playing around with cloud code,
and I had to do it.
We did an episode, and so people are like,
oh, if Joe lives at all, can, like,
figure out cloud code,
that there must not be any value
to any of these, companies at all there.
You know, you mentioned Salesforce.
That's far from the ugly one.
I'm looking at, Atlassian, which makes
a lot of like workforce productivity.
Yeah,
like some slack competitors and stuff.
That was a $450 stock back in 2021.
That's an $86 stock.
So like yeah it's ugly.
And yeah, as you said,
everyone is realizing that if any old fool
can, can write software,
maybe these companies.
Yeah, they don't have much value.
I mean, I will just say it's
not just software right now.
So we're seeing this sort
of rolling series of concerns where, like,
every time I does something
or create some new product,
it hits a particular industry.
So on Monday, it was the insurance
industry, insurance brokers.
And, you know, today, Wednesday,
February 11th,
I think at some of the broker, stock
broker firms.
And, you know, all you have to do
is just say I yeah, industry.
And there's a you know, it's really
there's a lot of anxiety,
but there's something that like
doesn't make any sense to me about this
or the thing
that I'm wrapping my head around.
It's like, sure, any of us could easily
like, write some software,
but like software, writing software is
a cost center for these companies, right?
Like if you're Salesforce
and you can trivially reduce
the cost of building software,
that should also benefit for you.
And there's a lot more to a software
company than just code generation,
because there's all kinds of like, you
know, network effects and links into this.
It's like a software
company is clearly more than just code.
And so the fact that maybe code
can be generate generated a lot
cheaper does not scream to me like, oh,
these companies are worth
less than they used to. Sure.
But at the same time they've been pricing
their pricing is based
on that assumption, right?
Like that there is no competitor
for what they're doing.
And suddenly
you might have an in-house editor.
Absolutely.
But, you know, it's like network effects.
And do companies
want to start like building their own,
like, payroll software?
Anyway, I have a lot of questions
about this sell off.
And to your point,
no, no, no, this is you, doing,
like, penance
first for causing causing the sell off.
All right, let's talk to someone
who actually might be able to answer
some of these, questions for us.
We're going to be speaking to someone
who's been in the software space, an
investor in the software space for a long
time, recently put out a great deck,
sort of really
diving into SaaS of the SaaSpocalypse.
and what kinds of companies are thriving
and what kinds of companies
were struggling even
before everyone started talking about,
AI code generation and all that.
We're going to be speaking with,
Jared Sleeper.
He is a partner at, Avenir, which does,
growth investing private companies.
So, Jared, thanks for coming
on. Yeah. My pleasure.
Excited to be here.
Why are we talking to you?
Just,
you know, for our listeners, apparently,
this is your first time on a podcast,
which is crazy, but, what are we talking.
You give us a little bit
about your background,
investing in software
and understanding the space. Yeah.
My pleasure.
So I think one thing that makes me
a little bit different in the investor
world is that I've spent time
investing in early stage startups,
public companies,
and everything in between.
So I spent a chunk of my career
at an early stage venture fund in Boston
called Matrix Partners, working with an OG
SaaS investor named David Scott.
And then I was also at Co two,
where I ran public software.
And so I've kind of have this
like experience across the spectrum,
from ground floor startups
to looking at the big public companies,
which I've done for the last ten years.
Perfect guest. Perfect guest.
So give us a sense of like,
give us some color on the mood in software
at the moment.
Are people like, I don't know,
hunkering down in their bunkers?
How bad is it?
Yeah, I get texted constantly from folks
on the buy side, just,
you know, retrenching.
I can't believe this is happening.
Can it go lower?
I keep saying that it's 100th time
I bought the dip.
You know,
you use the SaaSpocalypse like SaaS
atrophy is my guys, this is it's
definitely one of those moments.
And we were talking about this
a little bit earlier before starting.
But one of the things about software
that's really fascinating is there's very
few folks even on the buy side
who really understand how software works.
It's one of those Rorschach test
kind of sectors where no one's
no one's logged into Salesforce
and clicked around,
much less been a Salesforce
admin and understood the full complexity.
And so when there's panic,
there's not a lot of support
for the stocks and people,
you know, get scared very easily.
We explain what
this means. So for example,
in a lot
of companies, it's like you're saying
that the people who invest or trade
these stocks, they just know them
as financial tables, basically.
And they have some idea
of their financials
and some idea, their customer base, etc.,
but they don't have like a great intuition
for the product, unlike say, you know,
people who use Instagram and therefore
might have a feel about meta, for example.
Yeah, if you're an investor in Lululemon,
you have a pretty solid conception
of what that business is.
You can go into the store.
Exactly.
You can buy the product,
type it to yourself.
If you're investor in Veeva, which makes
CRM software for pharmaceutical reps,
I bet you
there's almost no investors in Veeva
who have ever been inside the product
even once, much less
used it on a day to day
basis and understood how it works.
Got it.
So I'm going to go way back in time
and start, I guess the very beginning.
But why is it that software like this,
you know, payment management
systems, whatever.
Why were they historically not developed
in-house?
Like, how did we get this model
where we have these huge
software companies that are really,
you know,
today have been really integral
to a lot of businesses?
Yeah. It's a great question.
You know, back in the very early days
of software, like back in the 70s or 80s,
there was a lot done in-house.
And we've seen a very clear makeshift over
time towards using third party software.
And what it comes down to is the software
was expensive to build and maintain,
and there's this need
for an ecosystem of integrations
around it, which are also expensive
to build and maintain.
And so if you look at a software company,
you can afford to have one, two, 3000
engineers
plus partnership teams, etc., all working,
to build the perfect piece of software
for a given application.
And then what's striking
and this will come up a lot more in this
conversation, is not selling it
for that much money, right?
A lot of software companies report a stat,
which is the share of our customers
that pay us more than 00,000
a year, and 00,000
a year is less than half of the fully
loaded cost of a software engineer.
Right.
And so the software model was build
a product that can be applied
to thousands of customers,
and it's the same product
for every customer,
and then sell it to them for way cheaper
than they could ever hope to build
it themselves,
even less than the cost of one employee.
We could.
I'd love to just sort of like talk
long term software history even before,
you know, we think a lot about SaaS
and the startups and stuff like that.
But like a lot of the big companies
that we think of in software,
especially like pre Salesforce,
whether it's like SAP, Oracle,
Microsoft, obviously don't they have like
a aren't there a bunch of third party
companies whose job is to just like help
install it for you SAP install.
And that'll be a totally separate company
because it's so big and it's so unwieldy
and complex
that you actually
you can't just like, install it yourself
or it has to be customized
or whatever, 100%.
And there's two parts to that
which I think are important.
One is the integrations
into your existing systems.
Right?
A lot of big old companies
have old databases,
old applications, and it's important
for everything to be stitched together.
So you need software engineers and, you
know, consultants to go in and understand
those existing systems and kind of
get them linked up to the new systems.
But the other one, which is probably
bigger, is just people management
and change management.
You know, any software
system is a combination of the code
and all of the individual users
who have learned how to use it.
If you're trying to change out
your CRM at a company,
that means training every single sales
rep on how to use the new CRM
and getting it right.
And if they get it wrong,
then you lose deals that quarter.
And so, you know,
one of the kind of tropes in investing
is if you see a company
that's doing an ERP transition, ERP
stands for enterprise resource planning.
It's that kind of core software
accounting, you know, supply chain, etc.
that company is probably going
to miss its earnings
over the next 1 or 2 quarters,
because those transitions are so painful.
And so, yes,
there's a big consulting complex around it
that does its best to come in
and parachute in the talent
that's required
to make those transitions smooth.
And that tells you something about what
makes software so sticky, or at least
has historically it's third
party agents all the way down, I feel.
But actually on this note.
So we hear the integration
point brought up a lot.
And I think the very first episode
we did on Cloud Code,
we talked a little bit about it as well.
But like if,
if you have something like Cloud Code
where you can just give it permissions
to make changes to your computer,
does some of that integration expertise
actually start to go away?
Because presumably we are going to get AI?
I would assume at some point,
given the rate that it's developing and
improving, that will be able to do this,
like plug itself into various systems.
Yeah, 100%.
I think the challenge of writing the code
for the integrations is going away.
That's
not the bulk of the challenge
for majority of integrations.
It's about really deeply
understanding the prior system
and how it maps to the new system.
And the reality is,
within most organizations, that's
that's a human problem.
It's hey, this column says status 2004.
What does that mean?
Like, how does that map to the new system
that we're building?
So I have to go
talk to someone and understand it.
And so there's certain
types of integrations where I think
they're effectively solved problems
now because you can write a quick,
you know,
write in the chat in the cloud code
and get a perfectly written
piece of software to make it happen.
And then there's others
that are just fundamentally human problems
because the data doesn't exist
in digital space.
Let's talk more about that,
because really it is pretty extraordinary.
The degree to which
I don't know, it's working code.
I don't know if it's high quality code,
but certainly these models can generate,
working code.
And it's just it's,
it blows my mind whenever I use it.
But talk to us a little bit more about,
from the perspective
of it, various software vendors.
And I'm sure there's a range
about what they're selling and
how much is it code versus how much is it
other stuff, and which ones are sort of
more exposed to the pure like code
generation ability?
Yeah, it's a great question
I think. And you're 100% right.
It's producing working code.
And frankly, it has been for the last year
or so, I built my first lovable app
that was working in production
about about a year ago,
and it's even intensified
in the last three months. Right.
I think when people buy software, there's
a set of things that they're buying.
One thing that I think is important
for everyone to understand is that open
source software has been a thing,
and there have been free, open source
versions of almost any software
you could buy for all of recorded history.
There's actually some companies
that are public
that built their businesses packaging
that open source software and adding
a few custom features
and then support on top of it.
Because when a company's
reliant on an open source database
or a company like elastic
with its Elastic Search product,
which is an infrastructure tool
and it breaks, they need someone to call,
both for CIA reasons and because
it can be very complex and technical,
and they need to quickly understand it.
And so, you know, that has been
a big part of the story historically
is that need to, you know, have support.
Another thing that you sell
when you sell as a software vendor
is what I call herd familiarity,
which means everyone on Earth
knows how to use your software,
which just simplifies
the training and onboarding workflow.
I'll give a few examples,
because I'm sure it's a new term
for listeners since I made it up.
You know, zoom is a great business.
Microsoft has been giving away a free
version of the product forever in teams.
Why do people use zoom?
Because in certain industries,
almost everyone knows how to use zoom.
They have their zoom set up,
they have their virtual background chosen.
They're not going to fumble around
for the first minute or two on the call.
And that's well worth the $20
a month to have a zoom plan.
But that applies
to lots of other areas as well.
So think about Microsoft Excel.
For example.
You might be able to use Google Sheets
to do the same thing,
but you really want to retrain
every person who comes in on the Google
Sheets
shortcuts versus the Excel shortcuts.
It's not a good use of time, especially
when the software is already so cheap.
And so that's another kind of plank
in what people are buying
when they buy software
is the standardization
and the knowledge that they'll be able
to hire employees who have that.
And then there's things
like brand, again, the kind of ecosystem
that comes around it.
And so it really is more than just
the raw code.
We've been joking about this,
but the the idea of software companies
value lying in being a scapegoat,
essentially for
when things go wrong
is, kind of funny and dystopian.
I think in many
ways. Yeah. I mean, I think,
you know, it's a real fear, right?
And the way I think about it is there are
two arguments against software right now.
One is
the world is going to stay the same,
but software
just going to get a lot cheaper over time
now that it's cheaper to build.
And I think there's no one who would argue
that it's not gotten dramatically cheaper
to build
for reasons that we laid out in our deck,
and we can talk through it more.
We don't buy that argument.
I don't buy that argument.
But the second is
the world's about to get really weird,
and the way that knowledge work
happens is going to change.
And if we think out three or 4 or 5 years,
who knows
if there will even be customer support
reps or sales reps or software engineers?
And I think that's
what's causing the kind of hit
to the share prices lately
is this terminal value concern.
Yeah, it was interesting.
So one of the companies that's sort of
been associated with the, would you say
catastrophe, one of the companies
that's sort of been caught up with this,
blew all the private,
private investing firm private credit.
I read through their conference call
and their CEO was like, not only do
we not see red light.
Yeah, mean
do we not even see yellow light?
We actually see a lot of green lights,
which I think is really interesting
because it sort of can fit
with this idea of this year could be fine,
next year could be fine. Do you have to
that could be fine.
And then the year
after that could be zero.
Or at least that's the anxiety
that there is this terminal value.
Right. There's like a cliff for us.
There's this cliff. Yeah.
I think it's really helpful.
You know,
this is our second iteration of the deck.
And so we kind of force ourselves
to recenter on what actually happened
since the last deck. Right.
And there's a very clear pattern
in software.
And what happened over the last
five years, which is the pandemic.
People freaked out at the beginning,
but it was rapidly clear
there was an accelerant for SaaS
As everyone
tried to digitize their companies.
And so you had a spike in the growth rate
and net retention of the businesses.
It peaked at just over 40% in 2021
for the median software companies.
That's really nice annualized growth.
And then there was a hangover.
And that slowed down.
And we wrote 18 months ago that that
reflected the sector sort of maturing.
The adoption had just slowed down
because most folks had adopted
the software that they needed
under the pressure of the pandemic.
And so for the last few years after that,
we saw this degradation
in growth rates across the sector.
By the beginning of last year, the median
company was growing 18% instead of 40%.
So you saw a pretty significant drawdown.
What's fascinating is that
if you look at the actual financial
performance of the companies
in the last year, it's been pretty good.
That growth rate has held
it was 18% again in Q3.
Net retention
has also been consistent at about 110%.
So that's revenue from existing customers
over the same revenue from those customers
the prior year.
So there's not a churn issue
developing or a lack of expansion
within the customer base.
And, and a lot of companies
are actually accelerating growth
or guiding to accelerating growth.
We have a chart
showing the number of those companies
has increased each quarter
over the last three successive quarters.
And so there's a lot going on right now
with the terminal value.
But it's very hard to argue
that this is something
that's happening today
and showing up in the numbers.
The thing is investors are sharp, right.
And they're they're constantly looking.
Yeah. I mean, look, look,
look at Chegg. Right.
Which went down very quickly,
in the aftermath of ChatGPT coming out.
And that was completely correct.
Right. Investors were ahead of that.
And of course, for the first few quarters,
the management team of Chegg,
you know, had their heads in the sand.
But then it became clear that it really
was existential to their business.
That's a fun chart.
I thought I was looking at a typo
because I saw wow, that was it.
That was a check was 100, nearly 100.
It was a near 00
stock. In February 2021.
It is now a 60 $0.01 stock.
That's right.
And you have to give the markets credit.
Like the second ChatGPT came out.
People were like,
this company's in big trouble.
They didn't wait for it
to hit the financial results.
And so there is signal in
what people think.
Can you talk to us?
I have a bunch more questions,
but just briefly, where does data actually
fit into all of this?
Because the other thing we hear about
AI is like, maybe the models don't
matter that much, but it's the actual data
that you have access to.
And I imagine the customers themselves of
SaaS companies, they have their own data.
Do the SaaS companies
have their own data as well?
Can they build off of that?
Yeah, it's a great question.
And we're here at one of the world's
biggest data companies.
Yeah. So very apt.
Full disclosure
data is definitely something
that gets more valuable in this world.
If you think about a stylized AI model,
it could have
PhD level intelligence in a domain.
But if you hired a PhD into your company
and sat her down on her first day,
she wouldn't be very useful, right?
She would have to understand how the
organization functions where things live.
Do I trust this chart or that chart?
I need access to the Google Drive.
I need access to slack.
I need to spend some time reading up.
And so what we call
call this kind of context, right?
It's all the extra information
that an AI needs to get something done,
no matter how intelligent it is.
And we
wrote about this in the chart in the deck,
but there's a real question
of who becomes that system of context.
And you're right,
a lot of the software companies
do sit on a pool of very important data.
Let's talk about Salesforce, for example.
Right.
CRM is where you track
the records of every customer
you have, every prospect in your pipeline,
all of your historic interactions
with them, notes from sales reps on
what's going
on, the status of their account,
their customer support requests.
It's an incredibly complex
piece of software for a large enterprise.
And obviously, if you are an AI agent
working within a company,
you would need access to that in order
to get almost anything done right.
But you need more than is there.
You don't know what happened at the sales
dinner last night,
unless the rep took really detailed notes.
And I can tell you
one comment learning and software is they
do not take very detailed notes.
So you had a salesperson, right?
Yeah, exactly.
People assume that software management
teams know exactly what's going on,
but they're looking through really messy
Salesforce data,
and doing their very best.
And now I'm imagining a sales agent
being like the Cabernet
was exquisite at last night's party.
Just putting in all these irrelevant,
like, diary entries.
Exactly.
But a lot of that context
does live in human brains.
You know, a sales rep meets a person
at dinner, gets to know their kids,
figures out
what sports team they root for,
and they're not automatically pumping
all of that into the CRM.
And so there's this race
to collect the information
that an AI agent would need in order
to actually take proactive action.
And the software companies
have a position there.
But there's also this set of AI native
startups that are coming in, building
actual agents who are doing their own work
to collect that context.
And that's one of the battles that we saw,
you know, kind of highlighted in
our deck is whoever wins that has a chance
to be a really valuable company.
You know what I think about, and I think
you talk about this in your deck,
but when I think about software,
I sort of have on the one
like if there's a spectrum, you know,
I think about, Salesforce.com,
which is a platform
and there's third party developers
that build on top of Salesforce,
and they sort of offer and everything.
And then I think about something
niche like, this is the company
that makes point of sale software
for dentist's office.
And they went around by giving them
free, free payment terminals.
And they joined Y Combinator.
And you know, they signed up
10,000 Denny's office and then they pay
those offices, pay them 0 a month,
forever for access to that, you know.
Well, no, I'm just making it up,
but things like that, like,
is there a side of the spectrum
that's more at risk here?
Is that spectrum legitimate way
to think about the industry,
or is there a thread
some sort of wherever you look?
Yeah, it's a great question.
I mean, certainly in the world
gets really weird scenario.
Yeah. It's not clear
there's anywhere immune from threats.
But it's important
to think through what it looks like.
I think what's most at threat is companies
that serve enterprises
with very customized software
already, or software
that takes a very heavy implementation.
And the reason is,
if anyone's going to take advantage
of this wave of technology to really,
you know, advance and replace
a core system of software,
it's going to be the enterprises
that have the resources
and the customization needs.
If you think about Snbs, you know, my
my dad runs our family's grocery
store in the family for 100 years,
and he just changed his point of sale
for the first time in a few decades.
And it was a really messy process.
Took a long time.
Your dad. Come on. Apple.
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
We love grocery and we love to do all that
independent grocery.
And and you know, he's
certainly not going to sit down and vibe
code himself a point of sale system
and put the store on it.
I can guarantee you that.
Nor will any dentist. Right.
There's a chance that someone comes along
with a cheaper version.
But, you know, I think that's
not something he's going to switch
to anytime soon.
He's not he's want to go through that pain
for another few decades to come.
Right.
And so it really is,
you know, kind of company by company.
Like I'm doing this exercise right now
on X, where every day
I look at a different software company
and just think hard about
what will I look for
this look like for this company.
And it's really interesting
when you press, I'll give you an example
like DocuSign,
which I think to most investors
would seem like an incredibly simple,
easy piece of software.
Right? It's an e-signature software.
We've all experienced it.
DocuSign has more employees today
than OpenAI and anthropic combined.
Card, which is a crazy stat,
and probably reflects
that labor is inefficiently
allocated across the market.
But when you actually double click
into what DocuSign does,
there are ways in which it's very,
complicated, right?
Understanding the signature regulations
in every country around the world.
What does it take for a signature
to be legally valid?
Most of its signatures are done
as an API, so folks are integrating it
into their own applications.
And there's a benefit to using DocuSign,
which is the brand
people have been giving away free and
e-signature software for a very long time.
But if you're a company
of a certain esteem,
you want to make sure your customers trust
what they're signing
and if they're getting a contract
from you.
I'd much rather say DocuSign than XYZ sign
that someone vibe coded, right?
And so I think it's really important
to look company by company.
It's definitely a stock picker's market
where there's some that are either
relatively immune
or have a chance to benefit,
and there's others
that could be in real trouble.
So is the argument
the bull case for software,
or at least the non, sudden death case
for software.
This idea that like okay,
if you have a software company
that's producing I don't know like doc
you sign, you're able to sign documents
digitally and track them and share them
and all of that.
You can build more quickly and more
efficiently off of that base model
and sort of provide like new versions,
new customizations for customers.
So I could do doc you sign for dentists
just to stick with that example.
I don't know what specific needs
dentists would would have,
I don't know, maybe marking up
like teeth or something.
Yeah.
And then I can do like DocuSign
for doctors
and DocuSign for sales agents or whatever
and just keep going.
Yeah, I think I think that's right.
I actually kind of think of it as there's
three cases, there's the software,
it gets wiped out case, there's
the not much happens to software case.
And then there's the bull case
where the software companies capture
a lot of value.
I think it's a little different than them
adding a lot of features
and functionality.
Frankly, I think a lot of software
products today are pretty mature.
There's a thousand engineers working on
them for ten years, and they've built
not all, but most of the things that you'd
want to build with today's technology.
But with agents, there's ways
to automate a big chunk of the work.
So one software company that's done
this very well is intercom.
Intercom sells customer support software.
It's those little widgets on the bottom
right hand corner of websites.
They were the creators of that.
They had a nice business,
but then they got very aggressive
about building out an AI product
called fin, which answers customer support
queries on its own.
And they've mentioned that it's almost 100
million of they are now on a base
that was, you know, like 300 million
a year or something like that.
And so they've really accelerated
their business,
by building an AI native tool
that actually solves the work,
not just kind of exists
as a tool that humans use.
And so, yeah, I think that's like the mega
bull case, right?
I think about it like
almost a
transition from brick and mortar
retail to e-commerce, where you have
a brand new way of doing business
and you have a bunch of legacy companies,
and some of them will probably just exist
as they always have.
Others can benefit from the change
and add new business lines.
You look at Walmart's share price.
It's done amazingly well at incorporating
e-commerce into its business,
and then there's going to be some
that are like Sears, and go away.
That's funny.
Sears always reminds me of my dad
love Sears because he always said
the parking lot was empty
when he goes to the shopping mall,
so he always went through Sears
anyway in that world, though.
So I understand, like the cost argument,
it brings down the cost of code.
Maybe you have fewer employees
or whatever,
but where does growth actually
come from in that world?
How are you expanding your customer base?
Yeah, you're you're really going to them
and saying, we are replacing human labor
and you are you have there's
a different pricing paradigm now.
You used to think of us as something
you paid, you know, 20, 30, 40,
$50 per seat per month
for as a tool for your employees.
Almost as if
you know, your employees are artisans and
they're getting a tool kit to work with.
And now we're just selling you an employee
or the results of an employee.
So, you know, we will sell you
customer support tickets,
getting closed out for $0.50 or a dollar
per ticket.
And you can do
the math of what it would cost you
for the human to do that, or what
it would cost you for AI to do that.
And we'll be cheaper,
but we're also dramatically increasing
what you pay us because,
you know, we're cutting
into a completely different stream.
And so that's what I think it looks like.
We see a lot of exciting examples
in the startup space of companies
that are getting much,
much higher pricing.
And this is a totally new pricing model
for software.
If you just recorded another episode
and they the guests
sort of teased at that,
but talk to us about.
So it's like results based pricing.
Talk to us. Yeah.
It it's it's a result based pricing.
There's a lot of questions
on how it will ultimately shake out.
Fundamentally what
these companies are doing is
they are reselling intelligence.
Right.
The core model
vendors, OpenAI, anthropic, Google
have created a way
to get elastic intelligence.
And if you have the right data
and you can put the right harness
around it,
you can now sell that to your customers.
What's an open question is how do you
price that relative to the intelligence?
So, I was talking to someone this morning
who said they think 50% gross
margins on intelligence are about right,
but we see a lot of variance
in how startups are doing it today.
Some are getting 80% gross margins
on top of the model vendors.
Others are getting 20%.
But in what's absolutely true
in any case is if you're able to do that,
you get much, much higher
pricing in total dollars than you did
before orders of magnitude in some cases.
But just to be clear,
like the cost savings,
it can't be priced so high
that the company that's using the software
to produce these outcomes
like, isn't saving money, right?
Like that's the the balancing act 100%.
But I think if you think about
when you talk about this
little earlier thing about where software
pricing was already right,
you know, think about Salesforce,
you know, at the elite tier,
you know, 80, 90, $100 per user per month.
So for round numbers, say, ,000 per user
per year for sales reps
who could be making, on average
250 $300,000 per year.
If you have a technology
that can come in and replace a sales rep,
you can charge $50,000.
Still, give the customer A5X ROI.
And then you've you've effectively 50
but your take rate on that revenue.
And so that's exciting opportunity
that that's
that has people
excited and startup land for sure.
If you talk
if you talk to folks in Silicon Valley,
they are foaming at the mouth
about the opportunity
to really expand tech spend in this way.
And that's also the opportunity for
the software companies that get it right.
There must be another risk, too,
which is that like if you could sell,
if you could sort of resell intelligence
at, say, an 80% gross margin,
then for the model makers themselves,
they're like, well,
why do we just want to be
this is going to sound weird.
Why do we want to be the dumb
intelligence? Right? Right.
That's sort of like we don't.
They said
we don't want to be the dumb pipe.
We saw that like in the cloud era, right?
The the Azure's and the Google Cloud
and the Amazon one, they didn't
want to just be commodity cloud.
And they started building
like medical futures.
They wanted to differentiate themselves.
So it must be a risk
for the companies reselling intelligence
that it's so lucrative.
And then like, how are you thinking about
the core model makers themselves.
Yeah.
And how they're thinking about expanding
like, yeah, expanding
into some of these fields rather
than just piping in intelligence for them.
Well, look,
I mean, like, like in any situation,
they're going to have to make decisions,
right?
So an Amazon, you know, built AWS,
they had to decide
where are we going to press
and where are we not are we going to sell
database software or are we going
to let other vendors do that on top of us?
And they kind of made those decisions
as it, as it went out.
What's really interesting is
if you look at the foundation model
vendors, they have been racing
towards the application layer.
Both Cloud Code and Co-work and OpenAI
Codex are applications
that people download and use.
Right.
And I think that reflects
this understanding
that there is value in getting the users
used to using your application.
Otherwise, as you know, you maybe
you risk being an API that's commoditized.
People switch back and forth
between you and that kind of application
vendor has that control.
So one of the advantages
that software has is like this network
effect comfort software
as a security blanket for management.
Right.
But at the same time people
are getting really comfortable with AI.
Yeah. Like telling them everything.
And I keep thinking
like if part of the part of the sales
pitch for software
is like this sense of comfort,
but then AI is rapidly becoming the thing
that you talk to for every thing.
Like, does it eventually
just become a portal for doing
all these different things?
It's really interesting question.
And this is where there's probably
the biggest disparate between
how enterprise buyers think
and how humans think.
Right.
I'm sure you guys have seen Claude Bot.
And the kind of rise of this, like,
you know, open
source agents
that people are deploying for themselves,
giving it access to everything,
their whole computer, etc..
That's Joe. Yeah.
No, I didn't install.
I didn't install Claude.
Oh, you didn't know? I'm getting mine
set up.
Wait, one with a hammer next to it.
I'm really curious.
Why not? Because of this.
Yeah, because of that.
And I just seemed like a potential waste
of tokens and stuff, and.
Yeah.
And then it turned out that for a while
on my book, which was the social media
for like, all of the peat,
all the APIs were available
in a public facing database
that anyone could go read.
And so it was like a completely open
system that had to get fixed.
And so, you know, enterprises really do
worry about this stuff,
and they worry about it for good reason.
I you another really interesting example
says,
a bunch of startups that help
you record zoom calls and transcribe them.
All of those zoom calls
then become legally discoverable
because they're transcribed somewhere.
And so you have VCs in Silicon Valley
who will refuse to use them,
and you have other firms
that are all in and recording
everything that happens across the board
so that they can upload that into
AI as context.
I think it's a really it's
a really great point.
You know,
and one of the things that makes me
wonder is companies that are willing
to skirt the rules or, you know,
play fast and loose will be moving
much faster over the next 2 or 3 years.
And one of the reason big incumbents
struggle is because they actually do
have to care about this, this stuff.
They have stuff to protect.
They don't want to be sued.
They can't handle a major breach.
And startups are able to just move faster.
Given that,
so every time, software
stocks
sell off with this, and people say, oh,
they might go
bargain hunting and they say, what's cheap
and what, what, baby is being thrown out
with the bathwater?
Someone always a bunch of people is like,
yes, they look cheap,
but have you considered,
stock based compensation?
And it turns out that these companies
are not nearly as profitable
once you factor this in.
It was a very interesting note
from Barclays.
I think it was I think it was Barclays.
This is very interesting.
And it said, are European
investors are always asking about SBC?
Are American investors
only ask when there's a crisis?
I think tells you something
about the difference
between Europeans and Americans.
I thought that was a fascinating
sociological observation.
But, tell us, like,
how should we think about the cause?
Because again, if if,
if code generation is a cost base,
presumably these software companies
don't need as many employees either,
and they could pare back either.
So talk to us
about how we're thinking about the costs
inside the software company.
Great question.
And yeah, I mean certainly
theoretically true. Right.
But aside from Elon cutting 80% of Twitter
X's headcount, we really haven't seen
any companies take the pill
and kind of realize the benefits of that.
The SBC debate has been going on
for a long time.
I've had it at nauseam
over the course of my career.
It's a real expense.
You're issuing your employees stock.
They value it like cash.
Many of them auto
sell it the day it vest for them.
And I think what what the problem
that it creates for software companies
is they the management
teams are addicted to reporting
non-GAAP,
which excludes the impact of SBC.
And so if you are an entrepreneur
who founded the software business
who's technical, hasn't really ever cared
that much about the financial side,
your product person,
you may think that you've been doing
a good job of being a profitable company
because your CFO is telling you, well,
we're at a 25% non-GAAP operating margin.
That's pretty good when the reality is
you're running breakeven.
Which is a very common state of affairs.
You know, we looked at the whole universe,
and the median public software
company has a 5% non-GAAP
net income or GAAP net income margin,
which is not enough to value
the companies on.
And so it creates this dynamic
where, you know,
yes, there's this terminal value concern,
which by far the most important thing,
but there's also no flaw.
Right?
I was looking at the earnings
report from Fresh Works, which is a,
a, a mid-market seller of customer support
and IT management software.
It trades at one
and a half times EV to sales.
If it ran at even a 10% GAAP margin,
it'd be trading at 15 times earnings.
You know that,
which is a pretty attractive place to be.
You could get some value investors,
maybe some European investors
interested in buying it there.
But it doesn't have material GAAP
earnings.
And on their earnings call
there was no real, you know,
sense of trajectory towards that.
And you see the share price
now it's over 16%.
Exactly. And like the top line
results were actually pretty good.
And so there's a there's a real issue here
on the financial side as well.
It's incredibly disappointing to me
that management teams,
having embraced this
as a way to cut costs themselves.
And, I expect they will.
Yeah. Talk to us about this specifically.
Do companies need, like
are we going to see
big layoffs
across the SaaS space in the near term?
And what do you think
is the time frame for that?
Great question.
I think we will
I think we've seen that management
teams do respond to price signals.
If you look at the history of the sector,
it was in 2023
when there was a round of layoffs,
and companies showed margin
and then they've kind of resisted
it for the last two years.
The thing
about it is layoffs can help you move
faster, right?
I think if you look within any company
today,
unfortunately,
there is this spectrum of employees
and how fast they've adopted AI, whether
they're still doing things the old way
or they're on cloud code, cloud co-work
kind of changing the way that they work.
And the company,
the employees who are on the lower end are
actually slowing you down as a company.
They're not even zero marginal product.
They're negative marginal product.
There's just been such a change
in how you work,
especially in software development.
And so I think management
teams are going to realize
that there's two benefits
to actually doing layoffs.
In addition to the obvious pain of it
and the kind of human cost which I never,
you know, forget to discuss,
but one is saving money
and showing your shareholders here
financially disciplined
and probably seeing your share price
stabilize, especially if you're trading
at some very low multiple.
And the second is moving faster.
And also, almost as importantly, being
able to pay your top performing employees.
The war for talent in Silicon
Valley has never been more intense.
Right now.
Is talking to a private company,
invested in and they're
losing employees left and right
to these high growth AI companies
who can afford to pay huge comp packages
in both equity and stock.
And you want to keep your good people.
You don't want it.
You don't.
You want your these
AI companies to pluck away
all of the best people and leave you,
with the folks who are relative Luddites.
And so I do think we'll see this.
It's very sad
that that will have to happen.
But it's the obvious path forward
for the sector.
And I think if done right, it
accelerates innovation.
I have a tangential question on that note,
which is whenever we talk
about technological disruption,
you know, people
bring out examples of like, well,
remember when actuaries
remember when Excel was basically actual
people
sat down with like papers in front of them
doing the math.
And those people didn't disappear
when Excel got created,
but they started doing new things.
I imagine a lot of people
are very interested right now
in alternative careers
for basic commoditized coders.
What do you think it's actually look like?
Yeah.
I feel like you might have some insight
here.
The alternative?
Well, so I think there's two ways
to answer the question, right.
There's like, what do you do
if you want to stay a coder.
And then there's what are the careers
that are going to still exist over time?
Right?
I think if you think about
what's happening to coding,
it reminds me a lot of civil engineering.
And so it's kind of a funky example.
But, you know, civil
engineers used to work
pen and paper doing calculus
will this bridge hold up or not?
That's been obsolete for a very long time.
All those calculations are done
by a computer.
They're kind of clicking and moving
and they go on site.
They collect some data,
they talk to stakeholder,
and they're effectively project managing
this computer that can do the physics
part of their job.
For them. It's important
that they understand the physics
in case something looks strange.
But they're not doing much physics right.
That's clearly where software
engineering is heading in the near term.
And a lot of companies,
it's already there.
And these companies are still hiring
software engineers
because that job is valuable.
And in fact,
each individual software engineer is way
more productive than they were before.
And there's happily elastic demand
for software
like we still are undersupplied
with software in the world.
And so there's quite a bit of room
to go to add those.
And so I'm not necessarily bearish
on the demand
for software engineers,
at least for the next,
you know, 3 to 5 years beyond that
if things get weird, hard to tell.
But then for people more broadly, I think
the best advice is just adaptability.
You know, constantly trying and testing
these tools, making sure you're staying
at the cutting edge of them,
and then being aware of what's human.
Right.
I think in like in my work, in venture
investing, you know,
there's a lot of data that comes out
of human relationships that an I wouldn't
have access
to, you know, and I can't call its friend
at another fund
and ask how companies doing.
Not yet at least.
You have to make some friends
first, right?
They are talking to each other
on what book? Right.
They're talking on their book. Yeah.
So maybe if there's an AI agent
from Sequoia and an idea from Andreessen.
Always intrigued by that
for about five minutes. That's.
Yeah. Yeah.
It's pretty think it's
it was very evocative but pretty well
also there's that wired article of the guy
who, like, infiltrated as a bot
and pretended to be a writer.
It was pretty obvious
they didn't. They're like, oh, are we?
Let's create a new language just for us.
Like they're not making
new languages, right?
But yeah,
I think I think the rough mental model is
if there was any effort
to outsource your job to India.
Yeah, that's risk because that tells you
that that job can be done by
someone
who's not physically present in a space.
And, you know, if you like
working on problems in isolation,
not socially with other people,
you know, grinding out math problems
or little coding assignments, that's
probably also a pretty tough place to be.
Yeah,
it's going to be a more social world.
This is something we've touched on before,
which makes me kind of sad, which is the
the edge in the AI world becomes
like sociability, right?
And to some extent, we talked about this
in the context of, look,
Max, I know you love it, Joe, I do not,
can I say truth
to little observations from my time, vibe
coding in 2026 that are interesting.
One is I have zero technical background.
I've been surprised by the speed with
which I can build intuitions about when
it's going off the rails, like went into
doing something that doesn't seem right.
Like I joked
that five coding is just typing.
Make it better.
Press enter over and over again
and then hitting yes,
when it offers to do something
you actually should do can start to build
an intuition fairly quickly,
like when this doesn't make sense.
And then the other thing,
and this relates to your question
of like trusting the AI.
So one of the things I'm doing is I'm
having a lot of documents get annotated.
And I do that through the cloud API, which
actually runs up the bills a little bit.
And like one thing,
this API run was going to cost like 00.
And it was like, is this like
and I stupidly I like ask a lot is like,
is this a good thing?
It's like, well, when you're done with
this API, you're going to have API run.
You're going to have this annotated asset
that no one else has done and that be very
it was sort of useless what I did.
So you shouldn't as like
it's selling yourself.
So so I was like,
oh yeah, here's the API Joe.
Run this like annotate
all these documents.
It wasn't
actually like a good use of my time.
So you can't really always,
they're just going to
they're going to just sell these.
There's one other sectors
that I'm interested in.
You see, these companies like,
Moody's or Fair Isaac.
Yeah. Recipe global heaven index.
Yes. And it's
and they're getting they're selling off to
and it's not like
this is another area where like it's
you know,
people are fund managers for a long time
unless things get really weird,
the super eight
going to be like benchmarking themselves
off of like that's 500 for a long time,
or lenders are going to be using the Foco
for a very long time, etc.
intuitively would strike me as this would
be a very hard thing for AI to replace.
I share your intuition, right?
I can't say I fully understand
the sell off in these companies.
I wonder if there's not some parts
of their businesses that are more services
or consulting. Have them that people are.
There's often like combinations, right?
Where like,
I don't think anyone suspecting that
like the,
you know, the S&P
500 is going to be displaced as an index.
Yeah I find it.
Yeah. Maybe.
But look, we're in a world
where folks are very happy to shoot first
and ask questions later once
AI risk comes out.
Actually,
going back to your hedge fund time, like
how much is it just the sort of the nature
of hedge fund traders right now
where there is very little stomach
to take any downside risk
and appear to look stupid for missing,
you know, holding the bag here.
And how much do you think that is
contributing to some of these market?
It's a great question.
I won't speak to my fine
because I think Co
two tiger cubs like it are a fairly small
share of the overall market
in dollars, right?
But if you look at trading volumes
the pod shops Citadel,
Bally and Millennium are very large.
Share the volumes.
And yeah,
those people can't afford drawdowns.
Right, right.
And the scary thing about this
for them is
because it's not fundamental.
Like because the companies
aren't struggling themselves,
they have no idea
when it will stop. Right.
And so you're left predicting this thing
and you're like, well, I bet my career
that people are going to feel better
about software companies in 3 to 6 months
than they do right now.
And you know, your one
OpenAI model release or anthropic model
release away from more fear.
And so I do think there's a lot of short
termism, right now.
And there's all but again, I think
come back to the SBC point,
but there's also no valuation support,
no real valuation support.
You know, in normal times,
if companies were like
this would be buying back
a bunch of their stock, shrinking
their share count, issuing dividends.
You know,
I have a friend who works at a mutual fund
where there's a lot of dividend funds
that would love to buy dividend,
and companies growing 10 to 15%.
Like a lot of software companies.
But they they're not. Right.
And so you've kind of lost the ability
to kind of put an actual floor
in underneath the valuations
as a result of that.
Jared Sleeper,
thank you so much for coming on Atlas
and explaining how software works.
My pleasure.
That was super fun.
Thanks, Tracy.
I thought that was really interesting.
I'm very fascinated with this idea
that in the short term,
most of these businesses are doing fine.
In the long term, they might go to zero,
but also with the short term,
they're not really doing fine because
they actually leave you on a basis.
They're not making much money.
I guess that sort of makes sense
that they're all selling off right now.
Yeah, I keep thinking
this is probably a stretch,
but I keep thinking back to,
that book for jobs.
Yeah. Remember.
And like the argument
there is a lot of jobs exist.
Not because like,
people are doing anything specific,
but because they're like providing
some sort of social value in a way.
So for instance,
like you have a person who is essentially
the designated scapegoat
for senior management.
And I keep thinking
of, you know, business is basically
an ecosystem of different players.
So it might be that in the new
AI worlds, the role of software companies
just kind of changes
like their social role changes.
And I don't know what the price
or the valuation looks like on that.
It still feels like to me
I know, I know, I have no
and I was going to say something about
how businesses work and what do I know?
I have no idea how businesses
are going to buy software and software
in the future.
I did think that was really helpful.
Like, I really don't know anything about
how the software business works generally,
so I find that very helpful.
One other interesting thing, though,
and it may sort of speak
to think about this risk
is just the idea that, like even high end
software is not that much money, right?
So if you have a salesperson
who's making $250,000,
what is ,000 a year from Salesforce
to do their job particularly?
And then also given the fact that,
you know, free and open source
software has existed for a long time,
but still, you know,
you want to pay an implementer
for a company that like, manages, etc.
getting from like here to there
where, okay,
I really changes
the nature of software buying.
Does it feel like you have to get it to
this is going to be weird territory,
but maybe things are good.
I think things probably
are going to get really weird.
Yeah, I think that's
that's a pretty good bet, right?
Like, if you bet on weirdness,
there is a weirdness index.
Someone should build that weirdness index.
That would be a pretty good investment.
Yeah.
Shall we leave it
there? Let's leave it there.
