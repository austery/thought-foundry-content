Now,
 jump
 ahead
 today.
 We've
 wiped
 out


over
 half
 of
 all
 the
 beef
 cattle


operations
 in
 business
 just
 over
 a


generation
 ago.
 We've
 lost
 52%
 of
 them.


We've
 wiped
 out
 25%
 of
 our
 mother
 cow


beef
 herd.
 And
 the
 four
 largest
 packers


controlled
 today
 about
 80%
 of
 the


marketplace.
 And
 consumers
 in
 2024
 paid


about
 $823


per
 pound
 for
 beef.
 In
 2021,
 the
 packer


and
 the
 retailer
 received
 over
 60%
 or
 60


cents
 of
 every
 consumer
 beef
 dollar
 and


the
 producer
 received
 less
 than
 40


cents.
 So
 here's
 this
 here's
 the


question.
 How
 in
 a
 competitive
 market


could
 that
 have
 happened?
 How
 could
 a


competitive
 forces
 in
 the
 marketplace


completely
 reversed
 the
 competitive


allocation
 of
 the
 consumer
 beef
 dollar


within
 the
 entire
 beef
 supply
 chain?
 The


answer
 to
 that
 question
 is
 it
 can't.


>> Hello
 and
 [music]
 welcome
 to
 another


episode
 of
 the
 All
 Thoughts
 podcast.
 I'm


Tracy
 Aloway


>> and
 I'm
 Joe
 Weisenthal.


>> Joe,
 what
 do
 you
 eat
 more
 of?
 Eggs
 or


[music]
 beef?


>> You
 know,
 I
 was
 just
 thinking
 um
 I
 want


to
 eat
 more
 beef
 in
 my
 my
 life.
 I


probably
 do
 eat
 more
 eggs
 ultimately,


but
 like
 beef
 is
 just
 so
 good.
 Beef
 is


the
 best
 food
 there
 is
 in
 the
 entire


world.
 I
 truly
 believe
 that.
 And
 every


time
 I
 eat
 beef,
 I
 think
 about
 why
 don't


I
 eat
 this
 all
 the
 time?
 It's
 so
 good.


It's
 so
 satisfying.
 All
 these
 nutrients.


I
 don't
 have
 this
 impulse
 to
 snack
 and


eat
 garbage
 afterwards.


>> I
 want
 to
 eat
 more
 beef.


>> I'm
 pretty
 sure
 I
 eat
 more
 beef
 than


eggs
 at
 this
 point.
 Like
 I
 will
 have
 the


occasional
 omelette
 and
 I
 mix
 a
 lot
 of


eggs
 into
 like
 Asian
 noodle
 dishes
 and


things
 like
 that,
 but
 not
 that.
 I
 aspire


to
 live
 the
 Tracy
 to
 have
 the
 Tracy


Aloay
 diet.


>> Okay.
 Well,
 speaking
 of
 beef,


>> except
 it's
 really
 expensive
 these
 days.


>> Yes,
 this
 is
 exactly
 it.
 So,
 I'm
 sure


everyone
 listening
 to
 this
 podcast
 at


this
 point
 has
 heard
 about
 rising
 beef


prices
 in
 the
 US.
 There
 are
 a
 lot
 of


headlines
 flying
 around
 um
 constantly
 in


recent
 days
 about
 this.
 So,
 for


instance,
 we're
 recording
 this
 on


October
 30th,
 and
 earlier
 this
 week,


President
 Trump
 was
 tweeting
 about
 how


he
 wants
 beef
 prices
 to
 be
 lower.
 He's


also
 been
 talking
 about
 buying
 beef
 from


Argentina.
 Yeah,


>> it
 is
 very
 much
 in
 the
 news.
 There's


also
 the
 whole
 soybean
 drama
 with
 China.


>> I
 think
 it's
 funny
 because
 in
 that
 Trump


post,
 she
 said,
 uh,
 cattle
 ranchers


should
 appreciate
 how
 good
 things
 are


going
 because
 high
 beef
 prices,
 but


bring
 them
 down.
 Um
 there
 is
 just
 a
 lot


and
 I've
 said
 this
 before
 on
 the
 show


which
 is
 that
 I
 think
 the
 ultimate


marker
 of
 civilization
 is
 the
 amount
 of


beef
 or
 protein
 that
 you
 can
 buy
 with
 an


hour's
 work
 that
 the
 median
 person
 or


the
 average
 person
 can
 buy
 with
 an


hour's
 work.
 And
 I
 think
 when
 it's
 going


backwards,
 we
 should
 be
 very
 disturbed.


So
 setting
 aside,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 very


fortunate.
 I
 could
 probably
 afford
 to


eat
 as
 much
 beef
 as
 I
 want.
 But
 the


price
 of
 ground
 beef,
 I'm
 looking
 it
 up


on
 the
 uh
 terminal
 now.
 It's
 like


tripled
 since
 2010.
 that
 there's
 like
 $4


around
 the
 pandemic.
 Now
 it's
 over
 $6.
 I


think
 these
 are
 extremely
 serious


issues.


>> I
 will
 say
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 need
 to
 be


quite
 as
 obsessed
 with
 protein.


Americans
 especially,
 we
 already
 eat
 a


lot
 of
 protein.
 Okay.
 Eat
 more
 fiber.


>> I'm
 not
 saying
 we
 need
 to
 be
 obsessed.


Actually,
 I
 do
 think
 the
 protein
 craze


may
 be
 a
 little
 out
 of
 hand.
 I
 just


think
 this
 is
 like
 a
 very
 good
 measure


of
 the
 advance
 of
 sort
 of
 a
 wealthy


society
 that
 protein
 gets
 more


affordable.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 get
 you
 a
 cow
 share
 for


Christmas.
 Thank
 you.


>> All right.
 Uh,
 well,
 I
 am
 happy
 to
 say


we
 do
 in
 fact
 have
 the
 perfect
 guest.


We're
 going
 to
 be
 speaking
 with
 Bill


Bullard.
 He
 is
 the
 CEO
 of
 Arafe
 USA.
 So,


Bill,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 coming
 on


Odd
 Thoughts.


>> Glad
 to
 be
 here.
 Thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you
 also
 for
 actually
 looking
 the


part
 of
 a
 cattle
 rancher.
 We
 really


appreciate
 that.


>> No
 one
 can
 deny
 that
 we're
 talking
 to


the
 perfect
 guest.


>> All
 right.
 So,
 why
 don't
 we
 start
 really


simple?
 What
 have
 you
 observed
 about


beef
 prices
 just
 you
 know
 in
 the
 past


few
 months
 or
 so?


>> Well,
 we've
 seen
 beef
 prices
 increasing


as
 you've
 indicated
 and
 we
 see
 cattle


pricing
 also
 increasing
 as
 you


indicated.
 So,
 we
 now
 have
 a
 positive


relationship
 between
 the
 price
 of
 beef


and
 the
 price
 of
 cattle
 and
 we
 are
 a


competitive
 ind
 industry.
 We
 do
 not
 rely


on
 government
 price
 supports.
 We're
 the


single
 largest
 segment
 of
 American


agriculture.
 The
 cattle
 industry
 gener


generates
 about
 a hundred
 billion


dollars
 a
 year
 in
 cash
 receipts.
 So
 it's


it's
 larger
 than
 any
 other
 commodity.


Corn,
 wheat,
 cotton,
 dairy.
 Um
 and
 and


we
 rely
 on
 competitive
 market
 forces,


but
 we
 have
 not
 had
 competitive
 market


forces
 until
 very
 recently.
 And
 that's


where
 we
 need
 to
 get
 into
 the
 history
 of


why
 beef
 prices
 are
 high.


>> Can
 I
 ask
 very
 quickly?
 You
 said
 there's


now
 a
 positive
 relationship
 between


cattle
 prices
 and
 beef
 prices.
 Is
 that


not
 always
 the
 case?


>> That
 certainly
 has
 not
 been
 the
 case,


especially
 since
 uh
 2015.


We
 saw
 an
 inverse
 relationship.
 We
 saw


beef
 prices
 heading
 skyward
 beginning
 in


[clears throat]
 2017.
 And
 while
 beef


prices
 were
 increasing,
 cattle
 prices


were
 falling.
 And
 this
 is
 really
 odd
 in


an
 industry
 where
 the
 only
 ingredient
 in


beef
 is
 cattle.
 So
 you
 would
 expect


there
 to
 be
 a
 harmonious
 synchronous


relationship,
 a
 positive
 relationship


between
 beef
 prices
 and
 cattle
 prices.


>> One
 of
 the
 things
 I
 discovered
 on
 the


terminal
 back
 during
 the
 pandemic.
 I


learned
 all
 these
 things.
 We
 actually


have
 an
 in
 uh
 index
 on
 the
 um
 terminal


the
 hedgers
 have
 the
 hedgers
 edge
 beef


packer
 margin
 which
 I
 imagine
 to
 some


extent
 reflects
 that
 spread
 and
 um
 we
 do


see
 it
 rise
 generally
 up
 really
 through


2021
 uh
 it's
 actually
 started
 to


compress
 quite
 a
 bit
 but
 just
 actually


uh
 why
 is
 that
 like
 what
 what
 explain
 uh


what
 explains
 why
 these
 things
 can
 move


in
 different
 directions
 what
 is
 the


added
 factor


in
 the
 price
 of
 beef
 that
 is
 not
 the


price
 of
 cattle.


>> Right?
 So
 let's
 go
 back
 to
 just
 over
 a


generation.
 We'll
 go
 back
 to
 1980.


Great.
 At
 the
 time
 we
 had
 1.3
 million


beef
 cattle
 farmers
 and
 ranchers
 in
 the


United
 States.
 We
 had
 about
 37
 million


cows
 in
 our
 mother
 cow
 herd.
 Beef
 prices


that
 consumers
 paid
 were
 about
 $2.40
 per


pound.
 And
 we
 at
 that
 time
 we
 had
 the


four
 largest
 packers
 in
 the
 industry


controlling
 36%
 of
 the
 industry.
 So
 if


we
 think
 about
 how
 the
 beef
 industry


works,
 it's
 the
 consumer
 beef
 dollar


that
 has
 to
 be
 allocated
 along
 the


entire
 supply
 chain.
 So
 back
 in
 1980,


every
 time
 a
 consumer
 spent
 a
 dollar
 on


on
 beef,
 that
 dollar
 was
 allocated
 by


competitive
 market
 forces
 and
 over
 60


cents
 of
 that
 dollar
 went
 back
 to
 the


live
 cattle
 producer,
 the
 farmer
 and


rancher
 and
 the
 cattle
 feeder.
 And
 less


than
 40
 cents
 went
 back
 to
 the


processing
 part
 of
 the
 beef
 industry,


and
 that's
 to
 the
 retailer
 and
 the


packer.
 So
 the
 producer
 was
 receiving


the
 majority
 share
 which
 made
 sense


because
 they
 kept
 that
 animal
 and
 uh
 for


15
 to
 18
 months
 before
 it
 was


slaughtered
 and
 converted
 to
 beef
 and


the
 beef
 packer
 only
 kept
 the
 animal
 for


about
 seven
 days
 and
 the
 retailer
 kept


it
 for
 the
 shortest
 amount
 of
 period


possible.
 So
 but
 the
 point
 was
 is
 that


when
 consumers
 were
 paying
 $2.40
 40


cents
 per
 pound
 for
 beef.
 60
 cents
 of


that
 dollar
 was
 going
 back
 to
 the


producer
 and
 only
 less
 than
 40
 40
 cents


was
 going
 back
 to
 the
 processor
 and
 the


retailer.
 Now
 jump
 ahead
 today.
 We've


wiped
 out
 over
 half
 of
 all
 the
 beef


cattle
 operations
 in
 business
 just
 over


a
 generation
 ago.
 We've
 lost
 52%
 of


them.
 We've
 wiped
 out
 25%
 of
 our
 mother


cow
 beef
 herd.
 And
 the
 four
 largest


packers
 control
 today
 about
 80%
 of
 the


marketplace.
 And
 consumers
 in
 2024
 paid


about
 $823
 cents
 per
 pound
 for
 beef.
 And


now
 in
 2020
 or
 2021,
 just
 a
 couple
 years


ago,
 the
 allocation
 that
 the
 competitive


market
 was
 making
 in
 the
 marketplace
 was


completely
 tipped
 on
 its
 head.
 In
 2021,


the
 packer
 and
 the
 retailer
 received


over
 60%
 or
 60
 cents
 of
 every
 consumer


beef
 dollar
 and
 the
 producer
 received


less
 than
 40
 cents.
 So
 here's
 this


here's
 the
 question.
 How
 in
 a


competitive
 market
 could
 that
 have


happened?
 How
 could
 a
 competitive
 forces


in
 the
 marketplace
 completely


reversed
 the
 competitive
 allocation
 of


the
 consumer
 beef
 dollar
 within
 the


entire
 beef
 supply
 chain?
 The
 answer
 to


that
 question
 is
 it
 can't.
 If
 our
 market


was
 competitive,
 that
 could
 never
 have


happened.
 That
 raises
 the
 concerns
 that


we've
 been
 uh
 struggling
 with
 for
 the


past
 several
 decades.
 Our
 industry
 is
 in


a
 state
 of
 crisis,
 and
 it
 has
 been.
 And


what
 has
 happened
 is
 is
 because
 of


industry
 concentration
 and


consolidation,
 the
 ability
 of
 the


multinational
 meatackers
 and
 retailers


to
 exert
 buying
 power
 upstream
 in
 the


supply
 chain,
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 we've


entered
 free
 trade
 agreements
 that
 have


allowed
 the
 meat
 packers
 and
 retailers


to
 access
 beef
 from
 around
 the
 world
 and


displace
 domestic
 production
 because
 the


beef
 that
 we
 import
 from
 Argentina,


Brazil,
 Uruguay,
 Nicaragua,
 Costa
 Costa


Rica,
 Australia,
 New
 Zealand,
 Canada,


and
 Mexico.
 It's
 a
 perfect
 substitute


for
 domestic
 product.
 So
 the
 more
 we


import,


the
 less
 we
 have
 the
 ability
 and


capacity
 to
 maintain
 domestic
 production


of
 this
 very
 important
 protein
 source,


which
 is
 beef.
 And
 so
 what
 we
 see
 today


is
 a
 dysfunctional
 marketplace.
 As
 I


described
 before,
 since
 2017,
 we
 saw


beef
 prices
 going
 up
 that
 consumers
 were


paying
 in
 the
 retail
 store.
 We
 saw


cattle
 prices
 going
 down.
 The
 latest


census
 shows
 that
 just
 in
 the
 5-year


period
 from
 2017
 to
 2022,
 we
 lost


106,000
 beef
 cattle
 operations.
 Farmers


and
 ranchers
 exited
 the
 industry
 during


that
 period.
 And
 the
 reason
 that
 that's


happened
 is
 because
 they've
 suffered


long-term
 lack
 of
 profitability.
 It's


because
 their
 market
 is
 dysfunctional.


It's
 because
 imports
 have
 displaced
 our


domestic
 production
 and
 our
 opportunity


to
 expand.
 And
 now
 we've
 hit
 a
 a
 huge


market
 shock,
 an
 economic
 shock
 to
 the


market.
 And
 that
 was
 the
 latest
 drought


that
 occurred
 in
 the
 latter
 part
 of


20120.


>> This
 is
 what
 I
 was
 going
 to
 ask.
 So
 just


to
 we're
 going
 to
 talk
 more
 about


industry
 consolidation
 for
 sure.
 And
 um


you
 know,
 I'm
 looking
 for
 instance
 at
 a


headline
 right
 now
 about
 Walmart


tightening
 its
 grip
 on
 the
 beef
 market


by
 setting
 up
 a
 new
 plant.
 But
 just
 to


play
 devil's
 advocate
 for
 a
 second,
 h


how
 much
 of
 this
 is
 just
 down
 to
 pure


input
 costs
 like
 grain
 going
 up
 or
 you


know
 the
 drought
 that
 you
 just
 mentioned


or
 labor
 costs


>> at least
 especially
 the
 move
 that
 we've


seen
 over
 the
 last
 year
 which
 I'm
 sure


which
 cannot
 obviously
 be
 explained
 by


multi-deade
 trends


>> by
 what?


>> By
 multi-de
 a
 multi-deade
 trend
 I


believe
 that
 is
 real
 etc.
 But
 let's
 talk


about
 some
 of
 these
 things
 that
 have


happened
 in
 the
 last
 year
 specifically


or
 the
 last
 whatever
 18
 months.


>> So
 what
 we've
 seen
 is
 our
 cattle


supplies
 have
 tightened
 to
 the
 lowest


levels
 in
 75
 years.
 We
 have
 extremely


tight
 supply
 situation
 but
 we
 have


incredibly
 strong
 beef
 demand.
 Consumers


willingness
 to
 pay
 for
 beef
 appears


unbounded.
 As
 prices
 have
 increased,


consumers
 have
 still
 cleared
 the
 grocery


store
 shelves
 with
 the
 product.
 And
 so


the
 latest
 the
 latest
 drought
 that


occurred
 had
 accelerated
 the
 ongoing


liquidation
 of
 our
 US
 beef
 cattle
 or


beef
 cattle
 inventory.
 And
 and
 that's


why
 our
 supplies
 are
 so
 tight.
 Uh
 and


yet
 you've
 got
 incredible
 consumer


demand
 for
 beef.
 And
 so
 we
 have
 seen
 a


spike
 in
 prices
 because
 of
 that
 strong


demand.
 Consumers
 continue
 to
 be
 willing


to
 pay
 more
 for
 beef.
 And
 but
 that
 is


not
 how
 our
 market
 has
 been
 functioning


for
 the
 past
 decade.


>> Let's
 say
 the
 rain
 come
 back,
 there's
 no


drought,
 etc.
 What
 are
 we
 talking
 about


for
 a
 timeline?
 Again,
 setting
 aside
 the


structural
 things,
 what
 do
 we
 talk
 about


for
 a
 realistic
 timeline
 for
 getting


back
 to
 where
 we
 think
 like,
 oh,
 we
 are


comfortable
 with
 the
 level
 of
 cattle


stock
 that
 we
 we
 are
 happy
 with
 the


level
 of
 cattle
 stock
 that
 we
 have
 in


this
 country,


>> right?
 So
 we
 currently
 produce
 about


three
 billion
 pounds
 less
 beef
 than
 what


is
 consumed
 in
 America.
 So
 the
 largest


segment
 of
 American
 agriculture
 actually


underproduces
 for
 the
 domestic
 market.


And
 because
 of
 the
 long
 biological
 cycle


of
 cattle,
 it
 takes
 about
 three
 years
 to


decide
 to
 hold
 back
 cattle
 to
 breed
 and


then
 to
 have
 a
 calf
 and
 then
 to
 raise


that
 calf
 to
 slaughter
 weight
 over
 a


period
 of
 15
 to
 18
 months.
 And
 so
 in


order
 for
 our
 industry
 to
 begin
 an


expansion
 phase,
 uh
 we
 would
 need
 a


price
 point
 that
 incentivizes
 producers


to
 make
 the
 investment
 to
 build
 the


herd.
 And
 unfortunately
 that
 that
 price


point
 occurred
 back
 around
 2023.
 We


should
 be
 in
 an
 aggressive
 expansion


phase
 now
 except
 that
 instead
 of
 uh


domestic
 consumers
 relying
 on
 US


producers,
 we've
 increased
 the
 volume
 of


beef
 imports
 to
 record
 volumes
 in
 2024.


That's
 displacing
 our
 domestic


production.
 And
 that
 increase
 of
 of


imports
 is
 not
 distinguished
 in
 the


marketplace.
 Consumers
 can't
 tell
 if
 the


beef
 they're
 buying
 is
 foreign
 beef
 or


domestic
 beef.
 H


>> that
 puts
 the
 power
 and
 control
 in
 the


hands
 of
 the
 packers
 and
 the
 importers


and
 retailers.
 So
 your
 question
 was
 how


much
 of
 this
 had
 to
 do
 with
 increase
 in


input
 costs?
 Well,
 the
 increase
 in
 input


costs
 reduces
 the
 the
 margin
 that
 US


cattle
 producers
 receive
 at
 at
 any
 given


price
 point
 and
 we've
 seen
 increased


production
 costs
 certainly.
 But
 the


point
 is
 is
 that
 cattle
 producers
 do
 not


set
 the
 price
 of
 beef.
 This
 the
 price
 of


beef
 is
 set
 by
 the
 packers
 and
 the


retailers
 who
 sell
 to
 the
 consumer.
 The


producer
 is
 a
 price
 taker
 in
 this
 market


and
 has
 been
 for
 decades.
 They
 have


cattle,
 they
 offer
 them
 for
 sale,
 they


accept
 or
 reject
 a
 bid
 by
 the
 packer
 and


they're
 producing
 a
 perishable
 product.


So
 when
 an
 animal
 is
 ready
 for


slaughter,
 ready
 to
 be
 fabricated
 into
 a


beef
 product,
 the
 producer
 who
 fed
 that


cattle
 has
 a
 week
 or
 a
 two
 to
 three
 week


window
 in
 which
 to
 market
 the
 animal.


Otherwise,
 it
 degrades
 in
 quality.
 Uh
 it


adds
 fat
 instead
 of
 muscle.
 And
 as
 a


result,
 the
 producer
 has
 um
 very
 limited


bargaining
 power
 in
 a
 highly


concentrated
 market
 as
 we
 have
 now.
 And


when
 they're
 selling
 into
 a
 market


that's
 controlled
 where
 forked
 packers


control
 80%
 of
 the
 market,
 uh
 they
 they


are
 uh
 victims
 of
 the
 abuse
 of
 market


power
 that
 emanates
 uh
 inherently
 from


such
 a
 highly
 concentrated
 marketing


structure.
 So
 the
 so
 the
 increase


production
 costs
 reduce
 the


profitability
 of
 producers
 but
 it


doesn't
 it
 doesn't
 affect
 the


producers's
 ability
 to
 market
 cattle.
 uh


that
 would
 be
 the
 demand
 for
 live
 cattle


and
 the
 demand
 for
 live
 cattle
 is
 offset


and
 undercut
 by
 increased
 volumes
 of


imports.


>> What's
 the
 relationship
 between
 beef


availability
 and
 dair
 the
 dairy
 industry


dairy
 cows?
 So
 one
 of
 the
 reason
 I
 bring


it
 up
 you
 look
 confused
 but
 the
 reason
 I


bring
 it
 up
 is
 because
 again
 Joe's
 going


to
 get
 sick
 of
 me
 mentioning
 this
 but


I've
 been
 reading
 this
 like
 70year-old


book
 on
 small-cale
 farming.
 I
 hate
 when


people
 are
 always
 bringing
 up
 books
 that


they've
 read.


>> I
 know.
 It's
 crazy.


>> Re
 was
 bring
 it
 up
 one.
 No,
 that's
 a


joke.


>> And
 you
 know,
 there's
 a
 chapter
 in
 it


about
 whether
 or
 not
 you
 want
 to
 go
 into


cattle
 farming.
 So,
 or
 cattle
 ranching


for
 beef
 or
 if
 you
 want
 to
 raise
 dairy


cows.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 you


learn
 from
 this
 is
 that
 every
 dairy
 cow


usually
 becomes
 a
 beef
 cow
 at
 some


point.
 once
 it
 reaches
 you
 know
 once
 its


milk
 production
 starts
 to
 dry
 up
 it


usually
 gets
 sold
 for
 slaughter.
 So


what's
 what's
 the
 relationship
 or
 the


interaction
 like
 there?


Well
 historically
 what
 you
 described
 is


true
 as
 the
 dairy
 animals
 uh
 have


exceeded
 their
 production
 lifespan.
 They


are
 marketed
 as
 call
 animals
 into
 the


beef
 supply
 chain.
 And
 uh
 it's
 a
 very


lean
 meat
 product
 that
 is
 mixed
 with
 the


higher
 quality
 trim
 that
 we
 obtain
 over


our
 grainfed
 animals
 that
 are
 fed
 in


feed
 lots
 produced
 exclusively
 for
 beef.


So
 there
 wasn't
 much
 competition
 between


the
 beef
 industry
 and
 and
 the
 dairy


industry.
 But
 here
 recently
 as
 we've


increased
 our
 technology
 and
 genetic
 cap


abilities
 uh
 we
 have
 begun
 to
 raise
 uh


more
 male
 beh
 dairy
 animals
 and
 are


bringing
 them
 into
 feed
 lots
 and
 feeding


those
 animals
 and
 they
 are
 now
 beginning


to
 compete
 with
 the
 beef
 cattle
 farmer


and
 rancher
 in
 the
 marketplace
 and
 this


is
 a
 relatively
 recent
 phenomena
 uh


that's
 been
 occurring
 in
 our
 industry.


>> Wait,
 why
 is
 that
 happening?


>> Yeah,
 say
 more.
 Well,
 it's
 happening


because
 there's
 there's
 a
 profit


opportunity
 uh
 to
 sell
 dairy
 cles
 into


the
 beef
 supply
 chain
 and
 uh
 and
 of


course
 that
 will
 compete
 directly
 with


our
 America's
 farmers
 and
 ranchers
 who


not
 only
 will
 have
 to
 now
 compete
 with


this
 increase
 in
 the
 the
 dairy
 beef


sector,
 but
 they're
 already
 dealing
 with


this
 undifferentiated
 cheaper
 import


flood
 uh
 that
 has
 been
 negatively


affecting
 their
 p
 profitability
 in
 this


industry.


say
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 about
 okay
 cattle


prices
 have
 gone
 up
 and
 so
 in
 theory


that
 as
 you
 said
 in
 theory
 that
 should


uh
 incentve
 investment
 etc
 but
 talk
 a


little
 bit
 more
 about
 some
 of
 the
 input


costs
 that
 a
 cattle
 rancher
 faces


>> making
 these
 decisions
 to
 expand
 this


their
 stock.


So,
 so
 one
 of
 the
 first
 factors
 is
 the


availability
 of
 sufficient
 land
 to
 raise


the
 animal
 because
 in
 the
 beef
 cattle


industry,
 the
 animal
 is
 primarily
 raised


on
 grass.
 uh
 after
 an
 an
 after
 a
 calf
 is


born
 and
 it
 suckles
 the
 mother
 for
 about


four
 to
 six
 months
 on
 grass
 and
 before


it
 is
 moved
 uh
 downstream
 in
 the
 supply


chain
 to
 become
 a
 yearling
 animal
 and


ultimately
 delivered
 to
 a
 feed
 lot
 where


it's
 fed
 until
 it
 slaughter
 weight.
 And


so
 the
 input
 costs
 include
 the
 fuel
 uh


with
 which
 to
 run
 an
 operation.
 It


includes
 the
 veterary
 expenses
 for


keeping
 your
 animals
 healthy.
 It


includes
 the
 land
 costs
 of
 maintaining


sufficient
 forage
 supplies
 for
 the


animal.
 It
 includes
 the
 cost
 of


equipment
 to
 put
 up
 hay
 and
 grain
 with


which
 to
 feed
 those
 cattle.
 Uh
 and
 it
 in


many
 instances
 it
 includes
 labor.


However,
 most
 of
 the
 family
 farm
 and


ranches
 here
 in
 the
 United
 States
 are


just
 that.
 their
 family
 farms
 and


ranches
 uh
 attempting
 to
 raise
 cattle


and
 they
 they're
 experiencing
 increased


input
 costs.
 You
 know,
 we
 could
 talk


about
 fertilizer
 costs
 too
 as
 well,


>> but
 uh
 ultimately
 the
 costs
 have


increased
 due
 to
 inflation.
 Yeah.


>> And
 that
 squeezes
 the
 margin
 that
 they


receive
 at
 whatever
 price
 point
 that


they're
 experiencing.
 In
 terms
 of


industry
 consolidation,
 the
 fact
 that


there
 are
 basically,
 you
 know,
 four


gatekeepers
 to
 beef
 processing
 in
 the


US,
 how
 did
 we
 actually
 get
 here?


>> Well,
 we
 got
 here
 because
 we
 were
 lax
 in


enforcing
 our
 US
 antirust
 laws,
 uh,
 the


Sherman
 Act
 of
 1890,
 the
 Clayton
 Act,
 I


think
 it
 was
 about
 1914.


>> Sorry.
 The
 last
 time
 we
 spoke
 about
 uh


eggs
 in
 a
 big
 series
 about
 chicken,
 uh


we
 talked
 a
 lot
 about
 antitrust,


>> right?
 Well,
 and
 that's
 a
 huge
 problem.


In
 fact,
 it's
 no
 coincidence
 that
 as


beef
 prices
 are
 increasing,
 we
 just
 saw


a
 settlement
 in
 a
 national
 class
 action


suit
 in
 which
 two
 of
 the
 largest


packers,
 Tyson
 and
 Cargill,
 have


purportedly
 agreed
 to
 settled
 the


consumer's
 complaints
 about
 beef
 price


fixing
 to
 the
 tune
 of
 about
 87.5


million.
 Um,
 so
 what
 we
 have
 in
 our


industry
 is
 a
 decadesl
 long
 lack
 of


enforcement
 of
 antitrust
 laws
 that


allowed
 the
 meatackers
 back
 in
 the
 1980s


to
 engage
 in
 what
 was
 called
 merger


mania.
 We
 saw
 an
 unprecedented
 volume
 or


amount
 of
 mergers
 and
 acquisitions
 in
 in


the
 beef
 cattle
 industry.
 And
 it
 was


through
 that
 process
 and
 no
 enforcement


of
 antitrust
 laws
 that
 the
 meat
 packers


were
 able
 to
 ex
 uh
 uh
 achieve
 this


extremely
 high
 level
 of
 concentration.


And
 and
 in
 addition
 to
 that,
 Congress


realized
 over
 100
 years
 ago
 that


independent
 livestock
 producers
 uh
 were


really
 vulnerable
 to
 the
 monopsin
 power,


the
 buying
 power
 of
 the
 concentrated


meat
 packers.
 So
 they
 passed
 what
 was


called
 the
 Packers
 and
 Stockyards
 Act
 of


1921.


>> And
 this
 this
 was
 to
 ensure
 that
 the


meatackers
 not
 only
 could
 they
 not


engage
 in
 anti-
 trust
 activities
 such
 as


monopolization
 uh
 and
 price
 fixing,
 but


this
 act
 also
 said
 they
 couldn't
 engage


in
 practices
 of
 procuring
 livestock
 from


producers
 that
 was
 patently
 unfair.
 Um,


and
 so
 this
 important
 act
 actually


helped
 to
 uh
 bolster
 the
 United
 States


ability
 to
 to
 ensure
 antirust
 violations


were
 not
 incurring
 in
 the
 marketplace


and
 it
 gave
 the
 independent
 producer


recourse
 in
 the
 event
 that
 they
 were


treated
 unfairly
 or
 deceptively
 by
 the


concentrated
 market.
 The
 problem
 is
 just


like
 our
 antirust
 laws
 that
 collected


dust
 on
 the
 shelf,
 so
 too
 did
 the


Packers
 and
 Stockyards
 Act.
 And
 yet


today,
 the
 US
 Department
 of
 Agriculture


has
 not
 promagated
 the
 rules
 necessary


in
 order
 to
 implement
 and
 enforce
 this


over
 100-year-old
 Packers
 and
 Stockyards


Act
 that
 was
 intended
 to
 protect


independent
 livestock
 producers
 from
 the


abuse
 of
 market
 power
 of
 the
 dominant


beef
 packers.


>> Do
 the
 children
 of
 ranchers
 want
 to


become
 ranchers?
 Uh
 there
 is
 a
 there's
 a


popular
 country
 song
 that
 came
 out
 in


2023
 by
 Cody
 Johnson
 called
 Dirt
 Cheap.


The
 entire
 premise
 of
 the
 song
 is
 about


this
 dad
 and
 he
 this
 real
 estate


developer
 offers
 him
 all
 this
 land
 and


he's
 about
 to
 take
 the
 money
 and
 then
 he


gets
 sad
 thinking
 about
 his
 kids
 will


never
 be
 running
 around
 on
 this
 and
 when


I
 hear
 the
 song
 I
 got
 a
 little
 cynical
 I


was
 like
 yeah
 but
 that
 daughter
 is
 going


to
 sell
 the
 land
 when
 she
 gets
 older
 so


what's
 this
 like
 she's
 going
 to
 move
 to


a
 big
 city
 but
 are
 there
 issues
 in
 your


industry
 of
 like
 the
 next
 generation
 of


ranchers
 like
 no
 I
 want
 to
 sell
 this


land
 to
 a
 data
 center
 or
 I
 want
 to
 sell


this
 land
 to
 a
 housing
 subdivision
 so


that
 I
 can
 I
 go
 work
 in
 finance
 in
 New


York
 City.


>> When
 you
 have
 an
 industry
 like
 ours
 that


has
 lost
 over
 half
 its
 participants
 in


the
 course
 of
 just
 over
 a
 generation.


>> Yeah.


>> It's
 not
 unsurprising
 that
 the
 average


age
 of
 the
 US
 farmer
 and
 rancher
 is
 now


somewhere
 north
 of
 58
 years
 of
 age.


>> Wow.


>> And
 one
 of
 and
 we
 hear
 anecdotal


information
 all
 the
 time
 about
 ranch


families
 who
 have
 struggled
 under
 a


economic
 cost
 price
 squeeze
 for
 decades.


their
 children
 have
 watched.
 They've


encouraged
 their
 children
 to
 do


something
 else
 other
 than
 to
 ranch.
 And


that's
 a
 huge
 problem
 that
 we
 have


because
 part
 of
 this
 expansion
 expansion


phase
 will
 require
 us
 to
 attract
 new


entrance
 to
 attract
 aspiring
 cattle


farmers
 and
 ranchers
 into
 the
 industry.


That's
 not
 happening.
 And
 even
 though
 I


said
 that
 the
 price
 point
 has
 was


sufficient
 to
 incentivize
 the
 expansion


uh
 over
 a
 year
 ago,
 we're
 not
 expanding.


And
 we're
 not
 expanding
 because
 our


cattle
 producers
 have
 recently
 witnessed


a
 complete
 collapse
 in
 cattle
 prices


when
 we
 were
 about
 where
 we're
 at
 today.


And
 that
 was
 just
 as
 recently
 as
 2014


and
 15.
 At
 that
 time,
 we
 had
 the
 highest


nominal
 cattle
 prices
 in
 the
 history
 of


our
 industry.
 And
 beef
 consumers
 were


then
 paying
 the
 highest
 nominal
 beef


prices
 in
 history.
 And
 every
 analyst,


government
 and
 private
 alike,
 said
 the


cattle
 producer
 is
 going
 to
 receive


another
 three
 years
 of
 very
 strong


prices
 because
 of
 that
 long
 biological


cycle.


>> This
 is
 a
 very,
 this
 strikes
 me
 as
 a


very
 important
 uh
 data
 point.
 The
 fact


that
 the
 rancher
 has
 been
 trained


essentially
 to
 expect
 that
 high
 prices


won't
 necessarily
 sustain
 themselves,


right?
 You
 could


>> the
 boom
 bust.


>> Yeah,
 the
 boom
 bust.
 We
 talk
 about
 this


across
 industries.
 It's
 like
 great
 that


the
 price
 is
 there,
 but
 are
 is
 the
 price


going
 to
 be
 there
 in
 three
 years
 when
 uh


that
 when
 that
 cow
 is
 ready
 to
 be
 sold


for
 meat?
 It's
 a
 very
 it's
 it's
 not


enough
 to
 just
 have
 temporarily
 high


prices.


>> Well,
 well,
 that's
 right.
 And
 that's


exactly
 what
 happened
 at
 the
 end
 of


2014.
 In
 2015,
 when
 everyone
 believed


that
 our
 cattle
 prices
 would
 stay


strong,
 they
 inexplicably
 collapsed.
 And


they
 collapsed
 further
 and
 faster
 than


any
 time
 in
 history.
 And
 they
 collapsed


until
 we
 hit
 that
 point
 of
 2017
 when


suddenly
 consumer
 demand
 was
 driving


beef
 prices
 higher
 and
 the
 meat
 packers


were
 paying
 less
 and
 less
 for
 cattle
 or


cattle
 prices.
 And
 so
 we
 had
 this


inverse
 completely
 dysfunctional


situation
 in
 the
 marketplace
 and


producers
 were
 hurting.
 That's
 the


period
 we
 lost
 106,000
 producers
 from


2017
 to
 2022.
 And
 only
 now
 after
 this


latest
 drought
 that
 we
 shrunk
 the
 herd


size
 to
 such
 an
 ultra-
 low
 level
 have
 we


seen
 the
 cattle
 prices
 begin
 to
 once


again
 respond
 favorably
 to
 the
 latent


forces
 of
 competition
 in
 the
 industry.


They
 began
 to
 chase
 beef
 prices
 upward


and
 we've
 seen
 that
 uh
 more
 acutely
 here


in
 the
 last
 couple
 few
 months
 uh
 as
 beef


prices
 have
 increased.
 But
 the
 the
 fact


is
 is
 that
 we
 have
 not
 enforced


antitrust
 laws.
 And
 what
 we
 need
 to
 do


now
 is
 determine
 to
 what
 extent
 are


today's
 beef
 prices
 caused
 by
 antirust


behavior
 in
 the
 marketplace.
 Not
 from


the
 cattle
 producer
 who's
 a
 price
 taker


in
 the
 marketplace,
 but
 by
 the


multinational
 beef
 packers
 and
 retailers


that
 are
 actually
 controlling
 the
 beef


market
 here
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Well,


speaking
 of
 that
 and
 expansion,
 one


thing
 we
 have
 seen
 is
 new
 entrance,
 new


corporate
 entrance
 moving
 into
 the
 beef


industry.
 And
 I
 mentioned
 Walmart


earlier.
 What's
 the
 thinking
 behind


that?
 Is
 it
 just
 a
 vertical
 integration


play
 or
 what's
 the
 additive
 for
 a


company
 like
 Walmart
 to
 get
 into
 beef?


>> Well,
 you
 think
 about
 our
 all
 of
 our


livestock
 sector.
 So,
 we'll
 start
 with


the
 poultry
 sector.
 That
 sector
 was


vertically
 integrated
 in
 the
 60s
 and
 70s


from
 egg
 to
 plate.
 It's
 the


corporations,
 what
 we
 call
 the


integrators
 were
 controlling
 the


production.
 The
 farmers
 own
 their
 farms


and
 ranchers.
 They
 invested
 in
 the


capital,
 but
 the
 integrators
 dictated


how
 the
 farmers
 would
 raise
 those


chickens.
 In
 fact,
 the
 integrator
 owned


the
 chickens
 and
 essentially
 hired
 the


uh
 farmer
 to
 raise
 them
 for
 for
 the


integrator.
 That
 model
 was
 then
 applied


in
 the
 80s
 and
 90s
 to
 our
 hog
 sector.


Back
 in
 1980
 when
 we
 had
 1.3
 million


cattle
 producers,
 we
 also
 had
 667,000


hog
 producers
 scattered
 all
 across
 the


United
 States
 raising
 hogs.
 Uh
 but
 today


we're
 down
 to
 65,000.
 We
 wiped
 out
 90%


of
 our
 hog
 producers
 because
 that


industry,
 the
 corporations
 involved
 in


that
 industry
 began
 to
 follow
 the


chicken
 model.
 And
 so
 we
 reduced
 the


number
 of
 participants
 and
 they
 began
 to


raise
 hogs
 under
 a
 highly
 concentrated


situation
 and
 it's
 completely
 vertical


vertically
 integrated
 from
 birth
 to


plate.
 The
 cattle
 industry
 is
 the
 last


frontier
 frontier
 for
 these
 major
 global


meatackers.
 Uh
 and
 it's
 because
 of
 the


forage
 requirements
 and
 the
 long


biological
 cycle
 of
 cattle
 that
 has
 has


prevented
 them
 from
 engaging
 in
 the


vertical
 integration
 model
 which
 we
 call


chickenization.
 and
 we're
 trying
 to


prevent
 the
 chickenization
 of
 our
 cattle


industry.
 Uh
 but
 the
 reason
 Walmart's


getting
 into
 it
 is
 because
 it's


profitable.
 So
 Walmart
 has
 decided
 it's


going
 to
 vertically
 integrate
 the
 beef


cattle
 industry.
 It's
 going
 to
 direct


what
 genetics
 a
 farmer
 rancher
 has
 to
 uh


use
 in
 order
 to
 raise
 the
 animal.


Walmart
 will
 dictate
 the
 production


practices
 and
 feeding
 and
 then
 Walmart


will
 provide
 the
 marketing
 outlet
 for


the
 producers
 and
 then
 Walmart
 will
 sell


that
 resulted
 beef
 product
 to
 the


consumer.


>> It
 really
 is
 chickenization.
 It's
 the


tournament
 system
 basically.


>> Well,
 and
 it
 will
 lead
 to
 that.
 So,
 the


tournament
 system
 is
 a
 pricing
 mechanism


that
 greatly
 benefits
 the
 integrator
 and


allows
 them
 to
 buy
 the
 chickens
 from
 the


farmer
 and
 pay
 less
 for
 their
 managerial


skills
 in
 raising
 the
 chicken
 for
 them.


Um,
 and
 that's
 that's
 a
 concern
 we
 have


with
 the
 Walmart
 model.
 Walmart
 wants
 to


lock
 up
 uh
 this
 segment
 of
 the
 beef


industry
 and
 they
 want
 to
 eliminate
 u


all
 these
 cattle
 producers
 just
 have


been
 eliminated.
 Hog
 producers
 were


eliminated
 in
 the
 hog
 industry
 and


poultry
 producers
 were
 eliminated.
 And


the
 first
 step
 in
 the
 process
 is
 you
 do


away
 with
 you
 eliminate
 the
 competitive


cash
 market.
 That's
 what
 allows
 them
 to


vertically
 integrate
 an
 industry.
 And


we're
 seeing
 in
 that
 in
 the
 cattle


industry.
 Our
 cash
 market
 has
 been


shrinking
 at
 an
 alarming
 rate.
 And
 as
 we


allow
 this
 to
 continue,
 we
 will
 soon
 see


even
 more
 vertical
 integration.
 What


this
 means
 is
 we're
 going
 to
 hollow
 out


rural
 communities
 all
 across
 America


just
 as
 we
 have
 been
 doing
 for
 the
 past


four
 decades.
 And
 that's
 because
 we
 will


eliminate
 profitable
 opportunities
 for


our
 independent
 familycale
 farmers
 and


ranchers
 uh
 by
 eliminating
 their
 cash


market
 by
 dismantling
 the
 competitive


infrastructure
 and
 simply
 handing
 the


industry
 over
 to
 a
 highly
 sens


centralized
 highly
 concentrated
 beef


packing
 and
 retailing
 industry.


>> Uh
 I'm
 going
 to
 ve
 veer
 into
 some


sensitive
 territory
 here.
 I
 don't
 know


anything
 about
 how
 you
 lean
 politically.


I
 also
 don't
 particularly
 care.
 It's


fine.
 All
 that
 being
 said,


I
 think
 that,
 you
 know,
 I
 have


stereotypes
 and
 I
 think
 if
 I
 imagine


what
 the
 typical
 uh
 cattle
 rancher,
 how


they
 are
 politically,
 guy
 wearing
 a


cowboy
 hat,
 speaking
 with
 a
 a
 country


accent,
 I
 would
 have
 a
 presumption
 about


how
 they
 might
 vote
 in
 a
 typical
 again,


not
 you
 specifically,
 but
 you
 know,
 I


have
 my
 stereotypes,
 etc.
 And
 they're


probably
 true.
 Has
 the
 current


administration,
 you
 know,
 talking
 he's


been
 talking
 to
 you
 guys
 via
 his
 truth


social
 account.
 He
 wants
 to
 to
 lower


prices
 but
 also
 appreciate
 him
 for
 the


high
 prices.
 A
 little
 unclear.
 He
 was


this
 current
 administration
 uh
 been
 a


friend
 to
 the
 uh
 to
 the
 independent


cattle
 rancher.
 Well,
 what
 independent


cattle
 producers
 needed
 is
 they
 needed


our
 imports
 to
 be
 managed,
 not
 to
 hand


to
 the
 meat
 packers
 the
 ability
 to


source
 whatever
 volume
 of
 imports
 they


want
 to
 displace
 our
 domestic
 production


to
 prevent
 our
 domestic
 production
 from


keeping
 up
 with
 growth
 growth
 in


population,
 which
 is
 what
 has
 occurred


here.
 And
 so
 what
 we
 needed
 was
 uh
 the


implementation
 of
 tariffs
 and
 tariff


rate
 quotas
 on
 countries
 that


persistently
 maintain
 a
 trade
 surplus


with
 with
 the
 United
 States.
 In
 other


words,
 countries
 from
 which
 we
 buy
 large


volumes
 of
 beef,
 but
 we
 sell
 to
 them


very
 little.
 So
 we
 have
 been
 calling
 for


tariffs
 and
 tariff
 rate
 quotas
 and


tariff
 rate
 quotas
 of
 course
 are
 limits


on
 the
 volume
 of
 beef
 that
 any
 country


can
 um
 export
 to
 the
 United
 States.
 And


so
 when
 President
 Trump
 uh
 took
 his


second
 term,
 that's
 the
 first
 thing
 he


began
 doing
 was
 imposing
 tariffs.
 And


for
 an
 industry
 that
 underproduces
 in


the
 domestic
 market,
 we
 need
 the
 tariffs


to
 provide
 our
 industry
 the
 space
 to


expand
 and
 increase
 production.
 So
 we


strongly
 supported
 the
 tariffs.
 When
 we


saw
 Brazilian
 imports
 absolutely
 explode


in
 2025
 and
 even
 last
 year,
 we
 were


thankful
 that
 the
 president
 imposed
 a


50%
 tariff
 on
 Brazilian
 uh
 exports
 of


beef
 because
 that
 that
 was
 going
 to


further
 keep
 our
 industry
 a
 wash
 in


these
 price
 depressing
 imports.


[clears throat]
 Uh
 so
 but
 when
 the


president
 announced
 this
 u
 idea
 to
 lower


consumer
 beef
 prices
 with
 by
 increasing


Argentinian
 Argentina's
 beef
 uh
 import


quoter
 rate
 we
 believe
 that
 he
 was


misguided.
 He
 was
 misinformed
 as
 to
 how


the
 market
 structure
 worked.
 I
 don't


think
 he
 was
 aware
 that
 our
 industry
 has


just
 gone
 through
 years
 of
 depressed


prices
 while
 consumers
 were
 experiencing


record
 beef
 prices.
 I
 don't
 think
 he


understood
 how
 severe
 the
 lack
 of


antitrust
 enforcement
 has
 adversely


affected
 our
 industry
 and
 caused
 our


industry
 to
 shrink.
 And
 so,
 uh,


producers
 are
 very,
 very
 concerned
 right


now
 because
 we're
 at
 the
 price
 point


where
 we
 should
 be
 expanding.
 But
 we're


not
 expanding
 as
 we
 should
 be
 because
 of


the
 concern
 for
 the


uh,
 market
 failure
 in
 our
 industry
 that


has
 not
 been
 corrected.
 It's
 because


we're
 not
 certain
 anymore
 whether
 the


president
 is
 in
 fact
 going
 to
 begin
 to


manage
 these
 imports
 or
 if
 he
 was
 just


going
 to
 let
 these
 packers
 continue
 to


import
 whatever
 volume
 of
 beef
 and


cattle
 they
 want
 to
 displace
 our


domestic
 production.
 And
 they
 do
 this


without
 informing
 consumers
 where
 that


beef
 is
 from.
 There
 is
 no
 country
 of


origin
 label
 on
 the
 imported
 beef


product.
 So
 consumers
 can't
 choose
 to


support
 the
 domestic
 supply
 chain
 versus


the
 foreign
 supply
 chain.
 And
 that's
 why


we're
 urging
 Congress
 to
 pass
 mandatory


country
 of
 origin
 labeling
 immediately.


And
 I
 think
 this
 will
 help
 to
 at least


mitigate
 the
 negative
 impact
 that


increased
 imports
 from
 Argentina
 will


have
 on
 our
 industry
 because
 then
 we
 can


go
 to
 the
 consumer
 and
 ask
 them
 them
 to


choose
 the
 higher
 quality
 USA
 produced


beef
 and
 support
 US
 cattle
 farmers
 and


ranchers.
 Look,
 I
 totally
 get
 where


you're
 coming
 from,
 but
 I,
 you
 know,
 I


live
 in
 New
 York
 City
 and
 I
 have


children
 to
 feed
 and
 one
 of
 my
 children


loves
 beef
 a
 lot
 and
 the
 vast
 majority


of
 Americans
 are
 not
 um
 cattle
 ranchers


um
 by
 any
 stretch.
 So,
 like
 what
 is
 the


you
 know,
 again,
 I
 understand
 that
 you


have
 a
 uh
 constituency
 that
 you


represent.
 You
 want
 to
 make
 your
 case.


Why
 should
 the
 ent
 the
 vast
 majority
 of


the
 country
 which
 are
 beef
 consumers
 get


no
 benefit
 from
 higher
 cattle
 prices,


get
 no
 benefit
 from
 higher
 beef
 prices?


Why
 shouldn't
 we
 want
 the
 either
 imports


uh
 channel
 or
 the
 Walmart,
 which
 frankly


has
 a
 long
 history
 of
 driving
 prices


down
 in
 almost
 any
 category
 they
 enter.


They're
 sort
 of
 famously
 a
 lowcost
 uh


seller.
 Why
 shouldn't
 we
 support
 these


trends?


>> Well,
 look
 at
 any
 other
 sector
 in
 the


American
 economy.
 So
 we
 do
 import
 large


volumes
 of
 goods
 from
 China
 for
 example


and
 a
 consumer
 can
 go
 to
 the
 grocery


store
 and
 see
 a
 chinapriced
 product


labeled
 as
 China
 product
 or
 China
 or


they
 could
 buy
 a
 USA
 product
 and


typically
 the
 USA
 product
 is
 going
 to


cost
 more.
 But
 consumers
 have
 a
 choice.


They
 can
 choose
 to
 purchase
 the
 cheaper


product
 if
 they
 want
 to.
 Now
 jump
 to
 the


beef
 industry.
 Consumers
 have
 no
 choice.


The
 product
 is
 undifferentiated.
 The


meat
 packers
 are
 importing
 this
 beef


from
 Australia,
 New
 Zealand,
 and
 these


20
 different
 countries
 I
 talked
 about


earlier.
 They're
 importing
 them
 cheaper


than
 what
 we
 can
 produce
 it
 here,
 but


there's
 no
 label
 on
 it.
 What
 there
 is
 on


it
 is
 a
 US
 inspection
 sticker,
 leading


unsuspecting
 consumers
 to
 believe,
 well,


that
 must
 be
 a
 domestic
 product.
 And
 so


because
 the
 consumer
 can't
 choose


between
 the
 cheaper
 foreign
 product
 and


the
 more
 expensive
 USA
 produced
 product,


there's
 no
 price
 saving
 for
 the
 consumer


because
 the
 packers
 and
 the
 retailers


will
 price
 it
 identical
 because
 they


don't
 have
 to
 distinguish
 it.
 So
 they


pocket
 the
 increased
 profitability
 of


buying
 low
 and
 selling
 high
 in
 the
 most


affluent
 beef
 uh
 consuming
 market
 in
 the


world
 and
 that's
 the
 United
 States
 of


America.
 That's
 that's
 just
 an
 example


of
 our
 dysfunctional
 market.
 Consumers


have
 not
 benefited
 from
 these
 increased


volumes
 of
 imports.
 Instead,
 these


increased
 volumes
 of
 imports
 have


reduced
 demand
 for
 our
 domestic
 cattle,


driving
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 cattle


producers
 out
 of
 the
 industry
 over
 the


past
 four
 decades.


>> Can
 I
 start
 a
 beef
 processing
 plant?
 Why


why
 can't
 I
 go
 into
 it?
 Like,
 it
 seems


like
 a
 very
 profitable
 business.


Certainly,
 if
 you're
 a
 JBS
 or
 someone


like
 that,
 you
 seem
 to
 be
 making
 a
 lot


of
 money.
 Why
 don't
 we
 have
 new


entrance?
 So,
 you
 have
 four
 packers


controlling
 80%
 of
 the
 fed
 cattle


market,
 meaning
 they
 also
 control
 about


80%
 of
 the
 box
 beef
 market,
 meaning


they've
 got
 long-term
 and
 short-term


contracts
 with
 the
 major
 retailers.
 They


have
 shelf
 space
 with
 those
 retailers.


So,
 if
 you're
 a
 small
 packing
 plant


trying
 to
 get
 started,
 how
 are
 you
 going


to
 market
 your
 beef
 when
 you're


marketing
 into
 such
 a
 highly


concentrated
 consolidated
 market
 that


has
 where
 the
 retailer
 has
 long-term


contracts
 with
 the
 largest
 dominant


global
 beef
 packers?
 How
 are
 you
 going


to
 access
 a
 marketplace?
 So,
 we've
 had


lots
 of
 smaller
 meat
 packers
 try
 to


start
 up.
 It
 it
 requires
 a
 huge
 capital


outlay
 to
 do
 so.
 Nevertheless,
 uh
 the


government
 actually
 during
 the
 past


administration
 has
 been
 encouraging


their
 growth
 and
 development.
 Uh
 but


they're
 struggling.
 They're
 struggling


because
 they
 have
 difficulty
 in


marketing
 their
 product
 even
 if
 they're


marketing
 a
 a
 high
 quality
 product.


They're
 marketing
 into
 a
 commodity


structured
 marketplace
 and
 the
 advantage


falls
 to
 the
 meat
 packers.
 So
 until
 and


unless
 we
 enforce
 our
 our
 market
 our


antitrust
 laws
 and
 our
 fair
 competition


laws,
 we
 will
 continue
 to
 see
 these


upstart
 experiencing
 severe
 difficulty


in
 in
 finding
 a
 profitable
 marketing


outlet
 for
 their
 product.


>> You
 know,
 I
 like
 I
 said,
 I
 really
 like


beef.
 Everyone's
 into
 protein
 these


days.
 We
 we
 talked
 about
 this
 recently


on
 another
 episode.
 Protein
 is
 really


hot.
 Um
 animal
 protein
 in
 particular
 is


really
 hot.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 influencers


and
 people
 have
 podcasts
 and
 they
 say


things
 like
 eat
 more
 red
 meat
 and
 our


attitudes
 about
 red
 meat
 have
 changed.


When
 I
 was
 growing
 up
 that
 was
 scary
 of


don't
 cut
 back
 on
 your
 red
 meat.
 Now


it's
 like
 oh
 red
 meat
 is
 like
 the


healthiest
 thing
 you
 can
 eat.
 I
 don't


know if
 that's
 true
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 people


would
 say
 that.
 um
 how
 much
 of
 the


prices
 that
 we
 pay
 whether
 it's
 for
 the


price
 of
 cattle
 or
 the
 uh
 end
 price
 of


uh
 ground
 beef
 or
 whatever
 or
 steak
 is


about
 the
 secular
 trend
 towards
 people


wanting
 to
 have
 more
 animal
 protein
 in


their
 diets.


>> Sure.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 huge
 factor.


I
 think
 there
 are
 a
 number
 of
 factors


contributing
 to
 the
 consumer's
 increased


demand
 and
 willingness
 to
 pay
 more
 for


beef.
 And
 I
 think
 therein
 lies
 the


answer
 to
 the
 problem.
 If
 we
 enforce
 our


anti
 antitrust
 laws
 and
 let
 the
 market


signals
 flow
 in
 our
 industry,
 we
 will


begin
 to
 expand
 and
 our
 uh
 production


will
 soon
 hit
 an
 equilibrium
 with
 the


consumer
 demand
 and
 we
 would
 see
 prices


subside.
 In
 fact,
 if
 consumers
 are


unwilling
 to
 pay
 current
 prices
 for


beef,
 they
 would
 shift
 to
 other
 protein


sources
 like
 like
 lamb,
 chicken,
 and


pork.
 and
 you
 would
 see
 the
 price
 point


from
 the
 retailers
 begin
 to
 fall
 and
 you


would
 see
 uh
 the
 high
 beef
 prices


subside
 and
 then
 uh
 actually
 but
 if
 the


government
 causes
 this
 to
 happen,
 if
 the


government
 interferes
 and
 forces
 the


demand
 for
 live
 cattle
 to
 decline,
 we're


not
 going
 to
 increase
 the
 size
 of
 our
 US


cattle
 herd
 and
 America
 will
 become


increasingly
 dependent
 on
 foreign


sources
 for
 the
 beef.
 Right
 now
 at
 2024


about
 22%
 of
 all
 the
 beef
 available
 in


the
 US
 market
 was
 imported
 product.
 And


if
 we
 look
 at
 our
 ship
 our
 sister


industry
 the
 sheep
 industry
 which
 is
 the


direction
 our
 cattle
 industry
 is
 going


in
 2024
 73%
 of
 all
 the
 lamb
 consumed
 in


America
 came
 from
 Australia
 New
 Zealand.


We've
 we've
 decimated
 our
 domestic
 sheep


industry.
 Now
 we're
 now
 government
 has


its
 sights
 on
 the
 cattle
 industry
 and


increasing
 imports
 without
 any
 product


differentiation
 in
 the
 marketplace
 will


simply
 exacerbate
 the
 ongoing
 shrinking


of
 our
 cattle
 producer
 in
 terms
 of
 the


number
 of
 participants,
 number
 of


cattle,
 and
 the
 number
 of
 marketing


outlets.


>> We're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 leave
 it
 there.


Bill
 Bullard,
 I
 just
 realized
 Bullard


nominative
 determinism,
 right?


>> Excellent.
 Excellent.


>> You
 had
 to
 go
 into
 cattle
 ranching.
 Um,


thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 coming
 on
 all


Thoughts.


>> My
 pleasure.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much.


>> That
 was
 great,
 Bill.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much,


>> Joe.
 That
 was
 really
 interesting
 and


definitely,
 you
 know,
 closely
 related
 to


the
 chicken
 series
 that
 we
 did.
 Um,
 and


again,
 it
 seems
 to
 be
 that


chickenization
 theme
 running
 through


agriculture.
 I
 hadn't
 realized
 that


cows,
 cattle
 ranching
 were
 basically


like
 the
 last
 frontier
 in
 agriculture


>> either.
 And
 I
 to
 be
 honest,
 I
 would
 have


already
 assumed
 it
 had
 been
 more
 or
 less


on
 that.
 I
 actually
 think
 the
 uh
 the


Walmart
 thing
 is
 uh
 very
 interesting


because
 um


>> on
 the
 one
 hand
 people
 look
 at
 an
 entity


like
 Walmart
 and
 it's
 like
 here's
 this


monopsiny
 player.
 It's
 going
 to
 drive
 so


much
 power.
 On
 the
 other
 hand
 you
 say


here
 is
 a
 new
 market
 entrance.
 This
 is


it's
 like
 here
 is
 the
 market
 has
 just


gotten
 more
 competitive.
 I
 think
 it's
 an


interesting
 gut
 check
 for
 people
 who


want
 to
 like
 think
 about
 like
 market


competition
 that
 when
 you
 read
 a


headline
 Walmart
 is
 going
 to
 get
 into


beef
 processing.
 Do
 you
 read
 that
 as


like
 bad
 or
 good?
 Because
 you
 asked
 why


aren't
 there
 more
 entrance?
 Well,
 here's


a
 new
 entrant
 coming
 in.


>> I
 have
 to
 say
 I
 shop
 at
 Walmart.
 I
 buy


beef.
 I
 buy
 those
 big
 Have
 you
 ever
 seen


the
 big
 like
 uh
 long
 packages
 of
 ground


beef?
 They're
 like
 this
 big.


>> Oh
 yeah,
 I
 love
 those.
 Yeah,


>> they're
 pretty
 good
 actually.
 I
 am
 kind


of
 floored
 that
 there's
 no
 country
 of


origin
 label
 on
 these.
 I
 never
 thought


about
 that.


>> I
 am
 a
 little
 skeptical
 it
 would
 change


much
 [snorts]
 like
 if
 would
 it
 not


>> like
 it
 mean
 like
 would
 you
 would
 you


spend
 meaningfully
 more
 or
 less
 on
 beef


presuming
 you
 expect
 that
 it
 was
 like


healthier
 what
 that
 it
 was
 safely
 uh


arrived.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 what
 I
 would
 say
 is
 I
 do


shop
 at
 Walmart,
 but
 I
 shop
 at
 Walmart


generally
 for
 bulk
 beef.
 And
 if
 I'm


looking
 for
 the
 really
 good
 stuff,
 I


will
 go
 to
 an
 independent
 farmer,
 of


which
 there
 are
 many
 in
 Connecticut,
 and


I
 realize
 like
 not
 everyone
 has
 that


luxury.
 And
 I
 will
 try
 to
 get
 the
 good


beef.


>> Uh,
 I
 might
 try
 to
 get
 the
 good
 beef,


too.
 It
 might
 come
 from
 Japan.
 Don't


they
 like
 treat
 their
 cows
 really
 well?


Like
 they
 like
 they
 like
 give
 their
 cows


like
 beer
 and
 all
 that
 stuff.
 Massages.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 I
 think
 uh
 I
 love
 talking


about
 animal
 industry
 economics.
 There's


a
 lot
 of
 tension.
 I
 will
 say
 one
 other


thing
 which
 is
 you
 know
 I
 asked
 that


question
 about
 like
 why
 should
 we
 care


the
 beef
 consuming
 part
 the
 beef


consuming
 part
 of
 the
 world
 which
 is
 the


of
 the
 country
 which
 is
 the
 vast


majority
 of
 the
 country.
 The
 US
 used
 to


run
 a
 very
 big
 uh
 trade
 surplus
 and
 food


stuffs.
 Only
 very
 recently
 in
 the
 last


couple
 of
 years
 has
 that
 turned
 into


deficit.
 Uh,
 it's
 probably
 a
 source
 of


some
 concern
 to
 me
 that
 like
 we
 no


longer
 uh
 can
 domestically
 satisfy
 all


of
 our
 food
 needs.


>> Oh,
 if
 you're
 worried
 about
 domestic


semiconductor
 capacity,
 then
 you


probably
 should
 be
 worried
 about
 food


capacity.


>> I
 think
 there
 are
 some
 some
 overlap


issues.


>> We
 can't
 eat
 the
 chips,
 Joe.


>> Oh,
 except
 for
 potato
 chips.


>> Except
 the
 except
 the
 other
 chips
 that


we
 can
 eat.
 I
 don't know.
 I
 think
 there


are
 some
 I
 think
 there
 are
 some
 things


to
 worry
 about
 or
 think
 about
 with
 food


that
 are
 a
 little
 different,
 a
 little


similar
 that
 maybe
 we
 should
 talk
 about


more
 at
 some
 point.


>> Absolutely.
 All right.
 Shall
 we
 leave
 it


there?


>> Let's
 leave
 it
 there.
