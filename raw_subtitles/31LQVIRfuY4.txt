Hi everyone, I'm Anthony.
Welcome to my channel
In the previous video
We talked about Bazi (Four Pillars of Destiny)
And what it brings to many friends
That sense of fatalistic anxiety
As we have emphasized
Here
I don't care at all whether fortune telling is accurate or not.
What deserves more attention is
This belief system
What preconditions and frameworks were set?
I saw in the comments section of the last video
Some people have mistakenly thought I'm criticizing the unfalsifiability.
We have already said
Whether it is falsifiable is not so important
What is unfalsifiable is not necessarily wrong.
The key lies in
Does this theory promote human freedom?
We just discussed
A possibility that fortune telling suppresses human subjectivity
But you are perfectly free to have your own personalized interpretation.
Text is dead.
People are alive.
For example, a friend told me...
He learned from "Selected Works of Mao Zedong"
Reading it reveals a power of self-affirmation
Although I disagree with this text
But I appreciate his way of interpreting it.
And the confidence he gained from it
As for whether it is faithful to the original meaning of the text...
I don't think it's that important.
so
The real power does not lie in the text itself.
It lies in each person's interpretation.
My analysis
This is how some people understand numerology.
If you feel that you don't understand it that way
Then you are perfectly free to stick to your opinion.
There's no need for me to emphasize this.
Let's get back to our topic.
We can find
Many fortune tellers predict your fate
They all implicitly contain a set of basic assumptions and models.
What we need to examine
It is precisely these consistent presuppositions
As we said before
Bazi (Four Pillars of Destiny)
Profoundly rooted in Chinese philosophy
and Chinese traditional culture
In other words, they all presuppose a theory of equilibrium.
Conservation theory or
The model of circular theory
In this model
Human inner temperament
It is regarded as a static, constant thing.
This is similar to the periodic table in chemistry.
You are gold, you are gold.
You're just a country bumpkin.
Your material, your hardness, your capacity
At the moment of birth
It's as if it was already locked by the factory settings.
It is precisely because of the presupposition of your inner self
It does not remain unchanged over time.
Therefore, the focus of this theory is...
Naturally, everything was transferred to
The ups and downs of external fortune
For example, marriage, wealth, job position, etc.
for example
We often hear fortune tellers say...
A boy and a girl whose birth charts are incompatible
They will clash if they are together.
Therefore, they are destined to quarrel and separate.
This is actually a very strange logic.
It is pre-defined
Each person's personality is like a hard stone.
Shape is predetermined.
And it will never change.
If you are square
She is round
You two are destined to clash if you come together.
So, this video...
We will start from this perspective.
This paper attempts to explore two different models of human nature.
and the philosophical origins behind it
I will upload this video.
Included in the list of "Psychology and Education"
If you have anything you'd like to discuss with me
And the topics of consultation
You can contact me via email to make an appointment.
First, we say
A person's personality is clearly not predetermined at birth.
As we discussed in the previous episode
In videos exploring genes and free will
The emphasis
Although our genes are predetermined.
However, gene expression is not predetermined.
Modern biology tells us
Gene expression is constantly influenced by the environment.
Even the influence of our subjective thinking
Even the most basic biological foundation
None of them are completely static.
Not to mention the character and personality built upon it.
Although a person's personality has one
A generally stable framework
But it is by no means a closed system.
In an intimate relationship
Relationship patterns between two people
It is constantly evolving and in motion.
Interpersonal conflicts between two people
Simply put, it comes down to incompatibility in one's birth chart.
This is essentially a pre-set premise.
The human mind and spiritual world cease to develop.
We lack the ability to adjust and grow.
For example
When we hear a fortune teller say to another person
Your life was full of hardships before the age of 20.
Soaring high between the ages of 20 and 40
But misfortune will strike again between the ages of 60 and 70.
Let's examine this logic carefully.
You will feel
This hides a mechanical assumption.
It believes that the total amount of good fortune you have in your lifetime is constant.
It views life as a zero-sum game.
As if it were your main storyline
Completely influenced by the peaks and troughs of external fate
Driving
Your takeoff at 40 is mortgaging your 60-year-old quota.
And your hardships at age 20
This is accumulating funds for good fortune in middle age.
This aligns perfectly with the Chinese philosophical principle of reversal at extremes.
Extreme prosperity inevitably leads to decline.
The lesson of extreme joy turning into sorrow
It warns us
If things are going too well and smoothly for you right now
Then you need to be careful.
Because according to the law of conservation of fortune
Misfortune is about to strike.
This way of thinking
It brought about a deep psychological discipline
It makes us afraid to fully embrace happiness.
They didn't dare to fully celebrate their success.
Even if you are doing well now
You also subconsciously have a presumption of guilt.
They believe this good luck is borrowed.
You'll have to pay it back sooner or later.
You must always be in awe and fear.
By artificially suppressing one's emotions
For example, don't be so happy that you try to bribe fate.
Let the inevitable reversal be a little gentler.
In such a closed loop model
The highest wisdom in life becomes avoiding misfortune and maintaining balance.
Rather than growth and creation
This philosophy appears to be an objective description of the laws of the universe.
But it is actually deeply rooted in
The political and economic conditions of traditional Chinese society
Throughout the long history of China
Individuals' political and economic lives are not guaranteed.
Faced with imperial autocracy, natural disasters, and man-made calamities
A person's fate often does not depend on their efforts.
And often subject to the whims of power.
Or environmental mutations
for example
You did a great job in business today.
Tomorrow, their home might be raided for offending the government.
Today, the list of successful candidates has been published.
Tomorrow I might be exiled for choosing the wrong side.
In this high-risk environment
Any sense of pride or standing out
Both could very well lead to a devastating blow.
Therefore here
We are not saying
People do not need the qualities of caution and care.
Rational and realistic caution is certainly essential.
It targets specific risks.
However, the caution we are discussing here
It's more like a subconscious fear.
It's because of some vague and indescribable feelings.
And habitually maintain an inexplicable sense of awe
However, this static circular theory
It is not actually a universal truth.
In stark contrast to this circular perspective
It is the view of human beings in Western philosophy and modern psychology.
In Western humanistic psychology
Existentialist philosophy
And in Hegel's dialectics
They hold a completely different model
That is, the human spirit develops linearly.
Or rather, it's a spiral ascent.
Chinese philosophy emphasizes "return to the source".
It emphasizes returning to the original balance.
Like a closed circle
But Western philosophy has this tendency
That is to believe in the spirit
Or, to put it another way, life is an irreversible evolutionary process.
Humans are not some fixed, unchanging element or material.
Rather, it is a process that moves towards a goal.
It is a continuous process of becoming
one's own verbs
Just as psychologists Jung and Erikson...
Or as Rogers believes...
A healthy person
His life trajectory
It inevitably tends towards complexity, autonomy, self-discipline, and freedom.
Our minds will move from ignorance to knowledge.
From the unconscious driven by instinct
Towards Self-Awareness
From simple reactions to complex integration
This means
You at 10, you at 30, and you at 60
Although they are biologically the same person
But in terms of mental structure
You are completely different people now.
Imagine a spiral staircase.
When you stand on the spiral staircase
You might feel like you're spinning in circles.
This is similar to the ups and downs of fortune in numerology.
Good luck and bad luck alternate
It seems like you've gone back to square one.
But in reality, the height you are at has changed.
Even if you face the same difficulties and setbacks again
Because your subjectivity has been upgraded.
How you deal with it
The meaning you extract from it will undergo a qualitative change.
that's why
The mechanical assumption of the conservation of good fortune is problematic.
Because it ignores the most important variable.
That is time
It is irreversible in the human spiritual world.
certainly
Some friends might say: Anthony
Your summary of Chinese philosophy
Isn't this too simplistic and crude?
Chinese philosophy also emphasizes development.
It emphasizes that people must constantly cultivate themselves.
For example, the Great Learning in the Book of Rites says, "If you can improve yourself one day, then improve yourself every day."
It means that people should update themselves every day.
Diligent in self-reflection
Confucianism emphasizes self-cultivation.
Become a sage and virtuous person who is both inwardly virtuous and outwardly wise.
Buddhism also distinguishes between ordinary people and Buddhas.
Emphasizing the tremendous transformation from delusion to enlightenment
Taoism also emphasizes becoming a perfect person, a divine person, or a sage.
Isn't this all about emphasizing...?
Should people develop from lower to higher levels?
How can this be called a circular theory?
This is indeed a very strong rebuttal.
But what we want to say is...
Any mature religious or ethical system
They are all ordinary people.
Distinguishing between masters and sages
There must be some kind of level.
But this does not mean
All religions hold a view of human nature as developing or evolving.
To determine whether a system is a circular theory
Evolutionary theory
The key point is not whether it has a hierarchy.
But it lies in the ideal state it defines.
It is a completely new self that has never appeared before.
It's still an initial setting that already existed.
When we examine it closely
You will find
The Ideal of Chinese Philosophy
Essentially, they are all regressions.
Mencius said that human nature is inherently good.
Wang Yangming's concept of "extending innate knowledge"
Their logic is
In your heart
There was originally a seed of a perfect saint.
It's just that it's been obscured by acquired selfishness.
The process of spiritual practice is not about creating a new soul.
Instead, it wipes away the dust like wiping a mirror.
Restore your original innocence
The same applies to Taoism.
It needs a person
Remove the artificial scheming and the alienation brought about by civilization.
Returning to that simple, chaotic state
The original, unadorned state
This Chinese philosophical view of time is actually reversible.
But time
This is the most direct expression of our subjectivity.
We usually consider time to be external.
Time in physical sense
It's the turning of the pages of the clock calendar on the wall.
But Kant had an extremely profound insight.
He believes
Time is the innate form of our internal senses.
All things, inside and outside.
Ultimately, it's a stream of consciousness.
It is the time process of consciousness
Your thoughts, your memories, your free will
They do not take up space
No need for length, width and height
But they must flow through time.
Real time is not time in the physical sense.
Rather, consciousness
Continuous flow
We know everything
Essentially, it's about arranging objects in chronological order.
The process of being incorporated into our consciousness one after another
Only in this way can we establish various kinds of rules.
Stream of consciousness
It can't be rewound like a cassette tape.
When you have experienced pain
When you have an awakening
The experience itself
It has already permanently altered the structure of your consciousness.
This is just like a book you've read.
Even if you forget it
But the you who has read it and the you before you read it.
In terms of mental structure
Minor but irreversible changes have already occurred.
Your stream of consciousness is like a river
New experiences added every moment
They are all reshaping the composition of this river.
Real development
It is the subject within the inner sense of time.
Through continuous, coherent, and irreversible conscious activity
Create a self that has never existed before.
In Chinese philosophy
This irreversible growth of consciousness
The construction of this subjectivity
It is often seen as something that needs to be guarded against
Even things that need to be eliminated
Whether it is Confucianism, Taoism or Buddhism
Their highest ideal
It is often not about reinforcing the boundaries of the subject.
Instead, it ablates the boundary.
The saying goes, "It's rare to be confused," and "Great skill appears clumsy." Life is like a play.
Returning to simplicity, letting go of ego, etc.
The logic behind this is
The clearer a person's consciousness
The stronger the sense of separation
The stronger the subjectivity
The further away from the Tao, the further away from it.
The more pain there is
Therefore, in order to resolve the suffering of life
The solution offered by Chinese philosophy is not to confront contradictions directly.
Upgrade yourself through the negation of negation.
Instead, it directly solved the problem of self-awareness.
It attempts to blur the lines between subjective and objective.
The boundary between spirit and matter, nature and freedom
This reminds me of a friend.
Things I've shared with you recently
When she shared with her friends
My views on mainstream family and gender concepts
Reflection
One of her friends said: Don't be so obsessed.
All birth and death are illusions
We came into this world to play a game.
Why take it so seriously?
This sounds very profound.
It even carries a sense of detachment and carefree spirit.
This way of thinking is very popular in China.
But this is also a philosophy of being overly clever.
Because it's before things even begin.
Or at the very beginning
Based on some kind of worldly wisdom
I foresaw the ending
This is a combination of Chinese and Western philosophy.
Fundamental differences in dealing with self-awareness
One is to do addition.
That is, to continuously differentiate, refine, and build.
The other is to subtract.
That is, to eliminate distinctions, blur boundaries, and return to chaos.
When we hear a fortune teller say to another person
You had a tough time before the age of 20
20-40 years old Gao Fei
But misfortune will strike between the ages of 60 and 70.
From the perspective of subtraction
This sounds like an unchangeable verdict.
Our instinctive reaction is
Should I do less?
Be less emotional
Shrink yourself into a dot
Or rather, to remain cautious and prudent.
So that this misfortune can be avoided.
But as we said before
doom
It is not an object that is absolutely independent of us.
It happened in my life.
This shows that it has some significance for us.
It's just a scene from the script of our lives.
But the nature of the plot depends on how the protagonist portrays it.
Of course, I must admit
This sounds cruel.
When we say
Everything that happens in our lives
When both are meaningful
This is for a person who is injured
It is indeed an offense
Or rather, it's like downplaying the other person's suffering.
therefore
I believe this is something we can only say to ourselves.
It can only serve as a self-requirement
You can't use it to demand things of others.
For example, some people
Mingming's life is going smoothly
Suddenly, an unexpected event occurred.
For example, experiencing betrayal, or falling ill.
Investment failures, etc.
This is certainly very painful.
Moreover, the person involved may be innocent.
They should not be held responsible for the harm they suffer.
However, I think
Even in the most innocent scenarios
Although we can choose not to take responsibility for the injuries we suffer.
But we still have a responsibility to how we deal with these wounds.
Misfortune is like a piece of raw material
It was rough, sharp, and even had a bloody smell.
It is indeed meaningless.
But human dignity is embodied in this.
Humans possess an alchemical ability
A person can use his self-awareness
Take this rough stone
Polished into an exquisite sculpture
Through in-depth exploration and reflection
Transform it into a
An existence with profound meaning to life
This is indeed very hard work.
Because this means
We cannot lie forever in the position of the innocent.
In the state of the victim
Even if we are truly innocent
But we still need to pick up this stone.
Take those things that were originally meant to destroy us
It has become the foundation for building our unique personality.
The hardest foundation
For example, a person who has suffered from trauma in their family of origin.
He lived in a terrible family.
It is indeed unfortunate.
Of course, it wasn't something he could choose.
However, he can choose to believe that he was ruined by his parents.
I am destined to never have a good intimate relationship.
He can also choose this way of life.
That is
It was because I suffered belittlement and disrespect
Therefore, we should be even more aware of this intergenerational trauma.
Interrupted here
That pain can actually motivate me.
To become a better person
This reminds me of ancient Greek tragedies.
According to Lu Xun
Tragedy is the destruction of something valuable for people to witness.
This statement is very accurate.
But in our traditional understanding
It is often easy to reduce it to a story of a good person suffering.
We think
A gentle and kind person
If misfortune occurs
That is the greatest tragedy
For example, the injustice done to Dou E.
In ancient Greek tragedy
The protagonist is often a hero
A hero is not necessarily a good person in the traditional sense.
And first
A person who does not succumb to fate and circumstances
If a person is merely a vessel of misfortune
The bearer of misfortune
He deserves sympathy.
But that doesn't necessarily mean they are worthy of respect.
Only when he uses self-awareness
The stone that was thrown at him
When regarded as raw material for sculpture
He then transformed from an object into a subject.
