This is Sandro Diaz and he's about to drop in from the world's largest quarter pipe. But all I could think about was why didn't he go from the very top? So we decided to ask Sandro and he told us that it would have been virtually impossible. See, at the top there's a 10 meter freefall, so you wouldn't roll, you would plummet. In fact, even where he launched from was near the absolute limit of what's physically possible. Because as you start skating faster than 30 km/h, something strange happens. The board starts to shake violently underneath your feet. The fastest human reaction time to balance is about 100 milliseconds. And as the speed increases, the board's vibrations come in faster and faster, and so your board might be moving one way while you're still trying to compensate for the previous wiggle. and you actually end up making these wiggles worse and worse until it's so bad that you just get flung off your skateboard. Now, Sandro reached an incredible top speed of 104 km/h. So you can only imagine how bad these speed bubbles should have been. But that's why he had some super firm shock absorbers installed, so he could actually go that fast. Although even those weren't enough to prevent some pretty nasty falls during training.
