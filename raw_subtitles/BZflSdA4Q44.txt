What makes someone wicked?
Is it the color of their skin?
Is it the story we've been told?
Or is it what they wear?
How do we make those judgments?
What clues do we rely on?
What assumptions do we carry,
sometimes without even realizing it?
As a costume designer,
it's my job to use those assumptions,
for better or for worse.
People often assume
my job is all fabric and sequins,
dresses, buttons,
maybe a good hat.
In truth, my job is about perception.
I am a storyteller,
and my medium,
my language, is clothing.
Through silhouette, color and texture.
I shape how you see someone
before they speak a word.
I decide whether
you lean forward with curiosity
or pull back with suspicion.
When I put a character
in a shade of scarlet,
or wrap them in velvet,
or cut them up in sharp black lines,
I'm asking you to feel
something about them,
instantly, silently.
That's what fascinates me.
How simple fabric
can tell us who is a hero
and who is wicked.
I seek out a thematic hook
in every project.
Something human,
something that allows me
to find myself in the story.
I'm not just decorating a character,
I'm telling a parallel story,
one that lives in the clothing.
Costumes are not static.
They move with the body.
They evolve.
Sometimes they even tell lies.
They reflect growth, conflict, resolution.
I can telegraph an entire emotional arc
in the fit of a jacket,
the fraying of a hem,
the way fabric breaks down under stress.
What's extraordinary is this:
you feel it, even if you don’t realize it.
Costume is a subconscious language.
I'm using your power of perception
to lead you through the story.
This manipulation of perception
carried me to "Hamilton."
At its core, "Hamilton" is a story
of us versus them.
Colonists versus empire.
Immigrants versus the establishment.
But Lin-Manuel Miranda
handed me something radical.
He said, "I want the audience
to see our Founding Fathers
through today's lens."
So imagine that challenge.
Black and brown bodies
dressed in 18-century coats and breeches,
rapping about revolution.
History reimagined in real time.
I design period silhouettes, yes,
but with restraint.
Neutral tones on much of the ensemble,
while allowing their skin to show through,
and the power of their voice
to ring true in center stage.
And then, in contrast,
King George III appears in full regalia,
bewigged, jewelled,
painted in perfect detail
from his portraitist.
He is the Old World, they are the New.
That visual duality,
modern bodies in period shape,
versus one man preserved in all his pomp,
is what makes the story
of democracy unfolding so compelling.
It takes the historically familiar
to frame a modern perception
of how our nation was formed.
And suddenly, there's Thomas Jefferson.
Tommy Kail, our director, and I, decided,
let's make him a rock star.
So on struts Jefferson
in flamboyant purple,
modeled after a pop icon.
Not by chance.
That was a statement.
History isn't dry or static.
It's alive.
It's charismatic.
It's complicated.
Even in subtle contrast,
like Hamilton's vibrant green suits
versus Burr's muted raisin palette.
I was planting seeds,
setting up a visual duel.
Until finally, at the end,
the two men stand together,
both in black capes,
equal in power,
equal in tragedy,
balanced, not in life,
but in history's memory.
The costumes weren't decoration.
They were commentary,
a way to ask whose history is this?
And who gets to own it?
From the Founding Fathers,
I jumped to 1950s New York
with Spielberg's "West Side Story."
Again, us versus them,
Jets versus Sharks,
white versus Puerto Rican.
For the Jets, I leaned
into blue-collar toughness.
Denim, polos, sneakers,
the uniform of boys rooted in concrete.
For the Sharks,
I turned to Latin textiles,
vibrant florals,
colors inspired by sun and sea,
but cut with elegance and aspiration.
These young men and women were dressing
for a life they were yet to claim.
I rejected the impulse
that these two gangs
are just mirror images of each other,
separated by language and skin color.
At the same time,
I clung to what was iconic,
like Anita's dress,
but gave it my own twist.
And then the dance at the gym,
that iconic scene
where the two worlds collide.
I let the colors bleed together,
warm tones crossing cool,
fabric echoing across lines.
Because even in conflict cultures mix,
the borders are never
as fixed as we pretend.
Design here could have
perpetuated stereotypes,
but my goal was to dismantle them,
to give both sides dignity,
authenticity, complexity.
The tragedy of "West Side Story"
isn't that these two sides
were so different.
The real antagonist was the city itself,
a system of development and displacement
that was tearing
their neighborhoods apart.
Both gangs were fighting for ground
they would lose regardless.
Costume allowed me
to underline that truth.
The beauty wasn't in the separation,
it was in the blend.
Then came "Wicked."
Elphaba, the Wicked Witch
of the West, has green skin.
She wears black.
We're very familiar
with the "Wizard of Oz" story
that tells us the Wicked Witch
of the West is evil.
Beside her, Glinda sparkles
in pink and glitter.
These colors confirm
who is good and who is wicked.
Or so we think.
But when I read the script more closely,
I realized Elphaba is intelligent.
She’s compassionate. She’s misunderstood.
Glinda, on the other side,
isn't always kind.
I wasn't designing stereotypes.
I was designing questions.
Who decides who is worthy of respect
and who is shunned?
Who decides who is cherished
and who is ostracized?
Who decides who belongs
and who is cast out?
As a black gay man entering into a field
that wasn't always comfortable
with my presence,
I know what it feels like to be othered,
to be misjudged at first glance.
Maybe that's why I'm drawn to stories
about marginalized characters.
"Wicked" isn't just about a witch.
It's about anyone
who has ever been judged
without speaking a word.
Why put so much care into costumes?
Because clothing carries memory.
A dress, a chair, a lamp,
these things hold
the fingerprints of their makers.
They capture a culture
at a particular moment in time.
They embody our aspirations
and our biases.
The clothes we wear,
the furniture we sit on,
the art we hang on our walls,
these things are costumes too.
They shape our identity.
They create culture.
Design is never neutral.
So I ask the question again.
What makes someone wicked?
It isn't the color of their skin.
It isn't the story that we've been told.
And it isn't what they wear.
It's our perception.
It's the costume we've been handed
and whether we choose to believe it.
My job, my joy,
is in making you reimagine
the answers to those questions.
Because wickedness can be designed.
And if it can be designed,
then maybe together, it can be redesigned.
Thank you.
(Cheers and applause)
Monique Ruff-Bell: Paul,
I have a quick question for you.
It was beautiful to see
your journey of inspiration.
Now with the release of "Wicked for Good"
is there going to be
an evolution in the costumes,
with the lead characters,
with the evolution of the story?
PT: Absolutely, yeah.
And it's a continuation
of how they evolve.
And I mean, that's really
what I'm talking about,
you know, is that,
you know, to create a reality
even within the world of fantasy
is what helps the story
relate to other people
or helps people relate to that story.
MRB: Absolutely.
And when will we see the magic
of your handiwork again,
after "Wicked for Good?"
PT: Oh gosh, who knows?
(Laughter)
I would say look to Broadway first,
and then, hopefully,
again on the big screen.
MRB: OK, thank you so much, Paul.
(Applause)
