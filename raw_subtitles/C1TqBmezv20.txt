An image of the Mona Lisa with a twist.
TEDAI, on the surface of the Moon.
A 3D fantasy world that you
can see being explored here.
What do they have in common?
They weren't created by humans
in the traditional sense.
They were generated by AI.
That is the very beginning
of what I call content 3.0.
It opens up possibilities
we've never had before.
Co-creating content together
between storytellers, artists, creators,
and us viewers.
Interacting with their creations,
talking with their characters,
exploring their worlds
and each and every one of us
leaning into what we enjoy most
in their creations.
I expect this to have as profound
an impact on the media
and entertainment landscape
as the shift from scheduled broadcasting
to on-demand streaming.
A true paradigm shift
that will make experiences
more engaging than ever.
Let's unpack what this could look like.
To do so, we'll use a taxonomy
of digital content.
Content 1.0 is content
that is just viewed by you.
I use the word “view” today for all types
of content we can experience.
Content 2.0 is possibly uploaded by you.
Think about modern social media.
Content 3.0 is generated by you.
Professionals may have trained the models,
prepared the setting for it,
but in the end, you are
a part of creating it.
Let's have a closer look.
Content 1.0 is professional.
Often many people
come together to create it
and the best experiences
for their audience.
Think about books, articles,
music, movies, games, etc.
It made and makes a lot
of money on the internet.
It's also very expensive to make.
Entire companies are built
around creating it,
owning their distribution channels,
and aiming to shape pop culture.
Content 2.0 is personal.
What started with simple
home pages for everyone,
memes and blogs,
evolved to include content
with increasing fidelity
as consumer recording devices
became more prevalent
and media-sharing platforms more powerful.
This culminates in modern social media.
With billions of people creating
and sharing content.
Between content 1.0 and 2.0,
we expect to create
over 100 zettabytes of data
in 2025 alone.
If we could set up
an HD camera back in time,
recording three gigabytes an hour,
a typical HD video stream,
this camera would have to start
recording 3.8 billion years in the past
to record this amount of data.
There would not be much
motion to watch at first,
since that is way before
the dawn of complex life on Earth.
If this were a 20-episode TV show,
the entire period of dinosaurs
would just be maybe one episode.
And 300,000 years of human history
would barely register in the credits.
If we are lucky, as a teaser
for the next big thing.
That is how unbelievably
much content that is.
And that is just what we're expected
to add in 2025 alone.
Now, this great amount of data and content
is what powers the dawn of AI models
and overall content 3.0.
It is generative.
With these amounts of data and content,
AI models can learn to understand it,
even to reproduce it and produce it.
For instance, large language models
need no introduction today.
GPT-3 was trained on hundreds
of billions of words.
Texts from articles,
books, social media posts, code.
When you prompt it, it will rely
on what it has seen before
to create a likely continuation.
But content 3.0 goes beyond text,
and other models can do this
for other modalities:
code, images, music,
all of these are starting
to look pretty good.
Even video is getting interesting.
Let's have a look at what
TED AI could look like in the future.
(Video) The very first TED conference
was held in Monterey, California.
Christoph Lassner: And that one, 
on the Moon.
Let's see when we'll get there.
But in the meantime, we have this preview
thanks to state-of-the-art
video and audio models.
Now, can we take this to another level?
What if instead of creating a video clip
shot from a single viewpoint
we could create an entire world
where you can explore every angle
and you can look around every corner?
That is what I'm currently working on
as a co-founder of World Labs.
At World Labs, we are building systems
that let you interact
with spatial intelligence,
understanding, reasoning about,
and generating spatial data.
The rooms you see here
don't physically exist.
They have been generated.
Our models can do that
from a single image.
For artists, creators, developers,
and sometimes just to enjoy a beautiful,
fantastical environment.
Our models can do this
because we help them interpret
vast amounts of data
in a spatial way.
For example,
this video of a walk through San Francisco
you see on the bottom left.
Our models then learn to understand
what 3D worlds look like,
how they can be explored
and generated.
So now we have defined
and understand this taxonomy
and the different types of content.
But is this everything
content 3.0 is ever going to be?
When I look at the models
we just talked about,
I see them as pieces of a puzzle
and the beginning of something
instead of its conclusion.
Of course, we can use
content 3.0 models as tools
to create more of content 1.0 and 2.0.
Just imagine a streaming service
where you describe your dream movie
and it appears in minutes.
A social platform where you upload a video
and it's just a prompt,
and it is immediately transformed
into a professional influencer clip.
So all of this may become a reality,
but I think it's still not realizing
the full potential of these models.
And this is where I start to dream
about new kinds of storytelling,
interactive worlds and experiences,
about characters that we can interact with
in so much more natural ways
than just dialogue boxes,
about worlds that we can explore
with no artificial boundaries,
about narratives
that are not predetermined.
Since being a teenager
and playing 3D games,
developing mods, levels, characters,
my journey has taken me
further in this direction
and I think now we have an opportunity
to take a huge leap forward
thanks to content 3.0.
The reason is that we can now
create interesting content
at or above the rate of consumption.
The impact of this fact
cannot be overstated.
Just imagine Michelangelo
painting an image in the blink of an eye,
faster than you can look at it.
Or Ian Fleming, writing
his James Bond novels
while you're reading them,
and even doing a full movie production
for you while we're at it.
This means that for every
individual viewer,
we can develop narrative on the fly.
We have never been able to do this before
at any point in human history.
Improv is so interesting and fun
because actors play it out
on stage without a plan,
improvising what happens next.
But this is limited to one narrative
per group of actors
and shared across the whole audience.
We can now have artists and producers
create a stage for a story.
A villain with an agenda.
A hero with an interesting back story.
A style for a world to be rendered in.
And that's it.
From here on out, the story will develop
between this world
and every individual viewer.
Notice how different that is
from content 1.0,
even content 1.0 games.
There, the story is prepared in advance,
their characters are scripted.
The amount of agency
this results in is very different.
Even more, characters
can break the fourth wall
for every individual viewer.
This has also never been possible before.
Imagine an actor reaching out
to every single viewer
and having a meaningful
conversation with them,
or reacting to them.
Or the viewer, reaching out to them
and telling them where
the villain is to be found,
or a new idea for a plot twist.
So between hunting supervillains
and racing sports cars,
a future James Bond might turn to you
and have a casual chat.
Would you ask him
about his Wiener schnitzel recipe?
I would stick with his martinis.
Or strategize with him
about where the villain can be found,
but you see the point.
It opens up an entirely new
and so far underexplored medium.
So let's have a look.
For content 1.0,
we have producers come together
to create content.
I'm talking about this
in the most general sense.
Writers, actors, directors, artists,
everyone who is involved
in creating that piece of content.
This piece of content is created once
to appeal to as many people as possible.
It has a high fixed cost,
and the producers are paying
for production
and distribution in advance.
So that means that this piece of content
has to appeal to as many
people as possible.
And we have to aim
for big successes at low risk,
with a very large target audience.
Content 2.0 changes these equations.
Viewers are producers.
We have lots of smaller
content productions at lower cost.
A social network is shouldering
the cost of distribution,
matching content to the right audience.
Everyone has an incentive
to create viral content,
but it can be niche.
After all, fans of niche content
are also producing it.
All this goes hand-in-hand perfectly
with an ad-driven business model.
Content 3.0 has a chance
to completely change this, again.
The producers can focus
on creating a model.
This does not even have
to be the final content,
it can be the setting,
the stage, the world
for the content to play in,
the background stories
of the characters and their situation.
The content is then co-created
with every viewer individually,
playing out live,
blurring the lines between
classic linear media, like movies,
and interactive media, like games.
And going beyond that.
Now, this won't be easy.
Initial attempts may fail.
Initial attempts may look awkward.
But remember,
it took us several decades
from the invention of movies
to be able to make films
that stand the test of time.
It took us a few decades
after the invention of computers,
to figure out how to make computer games
that stand the test of time,
and over the last years,
we have only seen the very first
experiments with these new tools.
Their economics are also
fundamentally different.
We're seeing cost reductions
and static content production
thanks to better AI tools.
But for fully, on-the-fly
generated dynamic experiences,
the cost per viewer is much higher
than for content 1.0 and 2.0.
So even the economics of making hits
might look quite different
than for content 1.0 and 2.0.
This is all currently rapidly evolving,
and I'm excited to see how
it will develop over the next years.
So in short,
content 1.0 is just viewed by you.
Content 2.0 is possibly uploaded by you.
Content 3.0 is generated by you
or together with you.
Even more, going forward,
I expect you'll be in it
and a part of the story
or interacting with it.
The best storytellers of a generation
will always tell the best stories
with the tools they have.
Content 3.0 gives them that.
An entirely new set of tools
that we are just beginning
to understand and explore.
These tools will require
new skills to master,
and a new generation of artists
will show us what that can look like.
So what do you think, Mr. Bond?
(Video) Bond: Hey, Chris.
Content 3.0 will be awesome, let's go.
CL: Thank you.
