>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 OddLotss
 podcast.
 I'm
 Joe
 Weisenthal


>> and
 I'm
 Tracy
 Aloway.


>> Today
 you
 are
 listening
 to
 a
 special


episode
 of
 the
 podcast.
 It
 was
 recorded


live
 at
 the
 future
 proof
 conference
 in


Huntington
 Beach.


>> Yep.
 We're
 going
 to
 be
 speaking
 with


former
 Dallas
 Fed
 President
 Robert


Kaplan.
 He
 is
 now
 vice
 chairman
 of


Goldman
 Sachs.
 Again,
 this
 was
 recorded


live
 on
 stage
 at
 Future
 Proof.
 So,
 take


a
 listen.


>> All
 right,
 let's
 uh
 just
 kick
 it


straight
 off.
 That
 jobs
 report
 that
 we


got
 last
 week,
 in
 your
 view
 with
 your


Fed
 hat
 on,
 maybe
 is
 a
 is
 a
 50
 basis


point
 rate
 cut
 in
 play
 for
 the
 next


meeting?
 I
 think
 50
 basis
 points
 is


still
 unlikely.
 I
 think
 we've
 been
 of
 of


the
 view
 for
 the
 last
 few
 months
 the
 job


market
 was
 weak.
 This
 latest
 report
 was


a
 little
 weaker.
 Having
 said
 that,
 the


reason
 25
 is
 more
 likely
 than
 50
 is
 it


wasn't
 the
 jobs
 market
 is
 not
 falling


off
 a
 cliff.
 We
 didn't
 get
 shrinkage
 and


inflation
 is
 running
 at
 2
 and
 3/4
 to
 3%


above
 target.
 And
 so
 it
 sort
 of
 puts
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 headwind
 on
 doing
 more


than
 25
 basis
 points.


>> I
 mean,
 I
 take
 your
 point,
 but
 the


report
 was
 still
 a
 huge
 surprise.
 So
 if


you
 were
 in
 the
 newsroom
 when
 that


number
 came
 out,
 just
 22,000
 jobs
 added,


there
 was
 a
 sort
 of
 collective
 gasp


because
 it
 was
 way
 below
 basically
 the


entire
 range
 of
 expectations
 for
 that


particular
 month.
 If
 you're
 at
 the
 Fed


and
 you
 see
 a
 number
 like
 that,
 what


does
 22,000
 actually
 tell
 you?
 or
 are


you
 sitting
 there
 going,
 "Well,
 maybe


I'll
 wait
 for
 the
 revision
 until
 I


really
 make
 up
 my
 mind."


>> I
 don't
 know
 that
 the
 weakness
 in
 the


jobs
 market
 was
 a
 big
 surprise
 to
 the


Fed.
 They
 didn't
 know
 exactly
 what
 the


number
 would
 be,
 but
 they
 expected
 to
 be


anemic.
 The
 the
 reason
 uh
 that
 the


unemployment
 rate
 has
 stayed
 low
 is
 we


are
 not
 we've
 shut
 down
 undocumented


immigration.
 We
 have
 not
 ramped
 up
 legal


immigration.
 And
 as
 you
 well
 know,
 we


are
 deporting
 some
 number
 of
 workers
 and


chilling


10
 to
 15
 million
 undocumented
 immigrants


who
 are
 in
 the
 workforce
 and
 some


percentage
 of
 them
 are
 not
 going
 to


work.
 And
 so
 supply
 is
 anemic.
 We've


thought
 for
 the
 last
 few
 months
 that


hiring
 was
 kind
 of
 we
 said
 at
 stall


speed.
 You
 should
 assume
 if
 GDP
 growth


is
 one
 and a
 quarter
 one
 and
 a
 half%


hiring
 is
 going
 to
 be
 anemic.
 So,
 we


could
 debate
 the
 number,
 but
 I
 I
 don't


think
 it
 was
 a
 big
 shock
 that
 it
 was


weak.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 wouldn't
 surprise


me
 to
 see
 the
 next
 number
 also


lethargic.
 Uh
 so
 why
 aren't
 we
 falling


off
 a
 cliff?
 Uh
 we
 still
 are
 running
 a


large
 deficit.
 We
 have
 tax
 incentives


coming.
 We're
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 an
 AI


data
 center
 power
 boom
 as
 you
 just
 heard


about
 in
 the
 previous
 session.
 And
 I


think
 that's
 still
 bolstering
 the


economy.
 Well,
 then
 let
 me
 take
 the
 flip


side
 of
 Tracy's
 question
 because
 okay,


maybe
 setting
 aside
 reasons
 for
 concern,


the
 flip
 side,
 as
 you
 mentioned,


inflation
 still
 running
 above
 target
 by


most
 measures.
 The
 stock
 market,
 I


haven't
 actually
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 it's


doing
 today,
 but
 it's
 very
 close
 to


all-time
 highs
 regardless
 of
 what
 it's


doing
 today.
 All
 kinds
 of
 people
 are


having
 a
 really
 nice
 time
 on
 the
 beach


in
 Southern
 California.
 What
 is
 the


evidence
 that
 as
 currently
 standing
 that


Fed
 policy
 is
 actually
 restrictive?


Clearly
 the
 FOMC
 has
 come
 around
 to
 this


view
 of
 cuts.
 It
 seems
 like
 cuts
 are


locked
 in,
 but
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 have


the
 FOMC
 view
 anymore.
 Like
 is
 it


obvious
 that
 cuts
 are
 needed
 at
 this


point?


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 think
 if
 it
 were
 not
 for
 the


weakness
 that
 we've
 seen
 in
 the
 labor


market,
 the
 Fed
 would
 want
 to
 stand,


Pat,
 because
 we
 are
 it's
 one
 thing
 to
 be


above
 your
 inflation
 target.
 We're
 not


moving
 toward
 the
 inflation
 target,


right?
 We're
 going
 sideways
 to
 backing


up,
 but
 with
 this
 weak
 labor
 market,
 I


think
 it
 brings
 the
 fact
 you
 need
 to
 cut


into
 play.
 Now,
 what's
 the
 neutral
 rate?


I
 think
 the
 neutral
 rate
 today,
 uh,
 you


got
 a
 2
 and
 3/4%
 inflation
 rate,
 75


basis
 point
 real
 Fed
 funds
 rate
 means


the
 neutral
 rate
 to
 me
 is
 around
 3.5%.


We
 don't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 space
 to
 cut
 to


get
 to
 neutral,
 but
 I
 think
 you've
 got


75
 to
 100
 base
 points.
 I
 think
 the
 goal


of
 the
 Fed
 will
 be
 cut
 in
 September,


stay
 restrictive,
 and
 if
 the
 labor


market
 stays
 weak,
 keep
 going.
 If
 it


stabilizes,
 then
 then
 you
 have
 the


option
 to
 to
 hold
 off.
 Um,
 and
 and
 I


think
 that's
 what
 they'll
 do.


>> Um,
 just
 going
 back
 to
 financial


conditions
 and
 stock
 markets
 at
 all-time


highs.
 I
 mean,
 if
 the
 Fed
 cuts
 at
 this


current
 juncture,
 you
 know,
 call
 it
 an


insurance
 cut
 or
 whatever,
 but
 if
 the


economy
 reacelerates
 after
 that,


>> which
 it
 may.


>> Yeah.
 Which
 it
 may,
 would
 you
 be
 worried


about
 that
 side
 of
 the
 outcome
 given


that,
 as
 you
 said,
 inflationary


pressures
 seem
 to
 be
 going
 sideways
 to


possibly
 up.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 look
 at


financial
 conditions
 and
 see
 see
 it
 as
 a


reason
 the
 Fed
 shouldn't
 act.
 I
 actually


come
 at
 it
 from
 someplace
 different.
 The


economic
 statistics
 are
 reflective
 of


what's
 going
 on
 right
 now.
 In
 fact,
 even


more
 than
 that,
 what
 has
 gone
 on,
 not


even
 what's
 going
 on
 right
 now.
 The


stock
 market
 and
 other
 financial
 markets


are
 a
 assessment
 of
 what's
 going
 to


happen
 for
 the
 next
 3
 to
 5
 years.
 We,
 as


we
 know,
 we're
 in
 the
 middle
 and
 the


early
 innings
 of
 an
 AI
 data
 center
 power


boom.
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 showing
 up
 yet


in
 product
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 productivity,
 but


I
 think
 a
 year
 or
 two
 from
 now
 it
 will.


The
 stock
 market,
 rightly
 or
 wrongly,
 I


think
 is
 making
 that
 bet.
 It's
 betting


that
 productivity
 is
 going
 to
 improve.


Corporate
 earnings
 are
 going
 to
 get


better.
 You
 you're
 not
 seeing
 it
 show
 up


in
 the
 current
 economy.
 The
 Fed's
 job
 is


to
 look
 at
 financial
 conditions,
 but
 but


adjust
 policy
 based
 on
 the
 current


economy,
 uh,
 not
 the
 bet
 the
 market's


making
 for
 two
 or
 three
 years.
 I'm
 glad


you
 brought
 that
 up
 about
 uh
 the
 AI


boom,
 the
 power,
 the
 data
 center
 boom


and
 so
 forth
 and
 that
 it's
 not
 showing


up
 yet
 in
 productivity,
 but
 it
 may
 be


showing
 up
 in
 greater
 strain
 on
 the


grid.
 It
 may
 be
 showing
 up
 in
 greater


strain
 on
 um
 certain
 electrical
 gear


that's
 necessary
 that's
 been
 in
 shortage


for
 all
 manufacturers
 for
 years
 now.


That's
 right.
 As
 of
 right
 now
 in


September
 2025,
 could
 we
 say
 that
 if


anything
 the
 AI
 boom
 is
 like
 sort
 of


having
 a
 crowding
 out
 effect
 or
 slightly


inflationary
 where
 the
 costs
 right
 now


just
 on
 a
 static
 extent
 setting
 aside


the
 bet
 are
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 drag.


>> There
 are
 two
 big
 structural
 initiatives


that
 are
 being
 pursued
 by
 this


administration.
 One
 is
 regulatory
 review


and
 regulatory
 relief
 because
 they
 want


to
 ease
 the
 speeding
 to
 adoption
 of
 AI


and
 get
 more
 capital
 available.
 But
 the


second
 thing
 is
 there's
 an
 extensive


re-review
 of
 the
 power
 grid.
 We
 are


behind
 China


in
 having
 enough
 power
 to
 fund
 the
 AI


explosion.
 We've
 got
 to
 invest
 more
 in


geothermal,
 more
 modular
 nuclear.
 We


need
 to
 make
 it
 easier
 to
 run
 a


refinery,
 make
 it
 easier
 to
 do


transmission.
 And
 I
 think
 you're
 going


to
 find
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 enormous


efforts
 because
 we
 are
 behind.
 And
 in


some
 states,
 to
 your
 point,
 there
 is
 a


crowding
 out.
 And
 I
 think
 people
 are


afraid
 at
 some
 state
 states,
 the
 leaders


are
 afraid
 to
 take
 more
 data
 centers
 for


fear
 it's
 going
 to
 crowd
 out


individuals.
 So
 this
 is
 a
 big
 structural


initiative
 that
 isn't
 getting
 in
 the


press
 a
 lot,
 but
 it's
 a
 big
 initiative


going
 on
 in
 this
 country.
 That's
 a


dramatic
 change
 and
 it's
 needed.


>> What
 does
 that
 actually
 mean
 for
 Fed


policy?
 Because
 if
 I
 think
 about
 this


crowding
 out
 idea
 and
 all
 the
 demand
 for


databases
 and
 the
 things
 that
 power


them,
 we
 have
 seen
 electricity
 prices


start
 to
 go
 up.
 I
 know
 the
 Fed
 the
 Fed's


preferred
 inflation
 measure
 is
 X
 energy


and
 food
 prices.
 But
 on
 the
 other
 hand,


electricity
 prices
 feed
 into
 the
 cost
 of


pretty
 much
 everything.
 And
 also,
 this


doesn't
 seem
 like
 a
 bottleneck
 that


we're
 going
 to
 be
 solving,
 you
 know,


within
 the
 next
 two
 or
 three
 years
 or


even
 10
 years
 to
 be
 frank.
 If
 you're
 at


the
 Fed
 right
 now
 and
 you
 see


electricity
 prices
 going
 up,
 how
 are
 you


thinking
 through
 that
 pressure?


>> So,
 let
 me
 put
 it
 in
 context.
 There
 are


crossurrens,
 uh,
 I
 mean
 real


crossurrens.
 You
 just
 mentioned
 one.
 On


the
 one
 hand,
 you've
 got
 the
 government


is
 trying
 to
 reduce
 government
 directed


spending
 and
 replace
 it
 with
 more


incentives,
 tax
 incentives.
 Obviously,


the
 tariffs
 have
 been
 put
 in
 place.


Those
 are
 slowing
 growth
 and
 they
 have
 a


tendency
 to
 raise
 costs.
 They
 might
 be


one
 time
 on
 the
 labor
 force.
 As
 I
 just


mentioned,
 we
 are
 actually
 uh


decelerating
 and
 reducing
 labor
 force


growth
 because
 of
 immigration
 policy.


That's
 actually
 helping
 us
 be
 at
 full


employment
 and
 the
 Fed's
 been
 taken
 by


that,
 but
 also
 makes
 prices
 stickier,


wages
 stickier.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 you


just
 said
 you've
 got
 these
 booms
 in
 AI


and
 the
 grid,
 and
 you've
 got
 uh
 uh
 we


don't
 we
 need
 more
 labor,
 we
 need
 more


power,
 and
 that
 actually
 stresses


prices.
 So,
 when
 you're
 at
 the
 Fed,
 when


you've
 got
 this
 kind
 of
 confusion,
 I


think
 that's
 one
 reason
 why
 they've
 done


nothing
 so
 far
 this
 year.
 But
 I
 think


the
 labor
 market
 is
 forcing
 their
 hand


where
 if
 it
 gets
 even
 weaker,
 they


really
 don't
 want
 that.
 And
 that's
 why


they're
 acting.


[Music]


Let's
 talk
 about
 AI
 and
 China
 a
 little


bit
 more.
 You
 mentioned
 the
 power


element
 and
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 people


anxious
 about
 the
 constraints
 on
 the
 US


grid
 and
 you
 all
 these
 big
 capex
 numbers


and
 can
 the
 grid
 even
 support
 that.
 What


else
 is
 different
 besides
 the


electricity
 component?
 Because
 some


people
 we've
 talked
 to
 talk
 about


there's
 a
 very
 different
 attitude


towards
 the
 tech
 diffusion
 particularly


out
 of
 China
 or
 supply
 chains
 that
 run


through
 China.


>> So
 uh
 and
 I
 just
 got
 back
 from
 Asia
 and


I
 was
 in
 China
 last
 week.
 When
 we
 talk


about
 AI,
 we
 tend
 to
 look
 at
 the


hyperscalers.
 These
 big
 giant
 companies


that
 make
 up
 a
 disproportionate
 share
 of


the
 S&P
 500
 and
 they're
 spending


hundreds
 of
 billions
 of
 dollars.
 They're


making
 a
 lot
 of
 money.
 When
 I'm
 in
 China


and
 we
 talk
 about
 about
 AI,
 they
 talk


about
 the
 word
 you
 use
 diffusion.
 They


talk
 about
 regular
 businesses,
 the


McDonald's
 of
 China,
 Luke
 and
 Coffee
 in


China,
 regular.


>> We
 have
 them
 in
 New
 York
 City
 right
 now


and
 I
 tried
 one
 and
 it's
 very
 good


actually.


>> Yes.
 But
 they
 those
 companies
 are


actively
 using
 AI
 to
 lower
 costs.
 And


you
 got
 So
 why
 is
 that
 happening?
 I'd


say
 we're
 further
 along.
 China's
 further


along
 than
 we
 are.
 Why?
 Their
 margins


are
 lower.
 They're
 doing
 it
 out
 of


necessity.
 Our
 margins
 in
 the
 US
 and
 our


companies
 are
 higher
 and
 so
 they're
 not


as
 much
 pressure
 to
 lower
 costs
 and
 make


AI
 experiments.
 In
 China,
 they
 don't


have
 a
 choice.
 It's
 so
 competitive.
 They


need
 to
 lower
 costs.
 But
 the
 thing
 that


struck
 me,
 there's
 a
 lot
 to
 learn
 from


what
 they're
 doing
 in
 China.
 Normally,


if
 we
 were
 a
 little
 more
 globally


integrated,
 we
 would
 learn
 those
 things


and
 bring
 those
 those
 learnings
 back
 to


the
 United
 States.
 And
 it
 reminded
 me


that
 globalization


is
 not
 dead.
 United
 States
 is
 is


choosing
 to
 play
 a
 different
 role
 in
 it


and
 stepping
 back.
 But
 I
 got
 to
 tell
 you


the
 other
 thing
 I
 saw
 there
 is
 there's


more
 coupling
 going
 on
 between
 China
 uh


and
 other
 countries
 that
 are


aggressively.
 Canada
 is
 much
 more


aggressive
 in
 trying
 to
 form
 new


partnerships.
 So
 I
 think
 globalization


and
 the
 AI
 story
 go
 together.
 And
 I
 got


to
 tell
 you,
 globalization
 not
 going


away
 and
 the
 US
 is
 going
 to
 have
 a


choice
 in
 the
 years
 to
 come
 how
 much
 of


a
 role
 we
 want
 to
 play
 in
 participating.


But
 it's
 going
 to
 happen
 with
 us
 or


without
 us.


>> So
 we
 can
 sit
 here
 and
 ask
 you
 what
 you


saw
 in
 China
 and
 what
 your
 thoughts
 were


about
 China.
 But
 I
 am
 very
 aware
 that


when
 you
 go
 on
 that
 type
 of
 trip,
 you


have
 Chinese
 clients
 who
 are
 asking
 you


your
 thoughts
 on
 the
 US
 and
 what's
 going


on
 here.
 What
 are
 the
 type
 of
 questions


that
 you're
 getting
 from
 Chinese
 clients


at
 the
 moment?
 What
 are
 they
 interested


in?
 So
 the
 biggest
 item
 I'd
 say
 of


discussion
 is


uh
 and
 and
 I
 used
 to
 be
 in
 Asia
 for
 the


first
 part
 of
 my
 career
 and
 what
 I
 found


in
 Korea,
 Taiwan,
 China
 to
 a
 large


extent
 their
 whole
 effort
 was
 to
 go
 from


low
 value
 added
 manufacturing
 to
 high


value
 added
 manufacturing
 and
 they
 tried


to
 wean
 off
 of
 lower
 value
 added
 manu


manufacturing.
 What's
 an
 example?


T-shirts
 and
 sneakers
 used
 to
 be
 made
 in


China.
 Today
 they're
 made
 in
 Vietnam.


Why
 China
 wants
 to
 move
 up
 the
 value


chain?
 Because
 their
 feeling
 is
 they're


going
 to
 raise
 the
 standard
 of
 living
 to


higher
 value
 added
 manufacturing.
 The


the
 question
 sometimes
 I
 get
 when
 I'm


over
 there
 is
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 reshore


to
 the
 United
 States,
 are
 you
 going
 to


really
 reshore
 lumber,
 aluminum,


uh
 some
 of
 these
 other
 lower
 value
 added


manufacturing?


Uh,
 wouldn't
 solidifying
 the


relationship
 with
 Canada
 and
 Mexico
 make


sense
 where
 you
 can
 get
 cheap
 natural


resources
 from
 Canada,
 cheap
 labor
 from


Mexico,
 and
 solidify
 North
 America?
 And


so
 I'd
 say
 they're
 not
 critical
 of
 us,


but
 they're
 scratching
 their
 heads
 a


little
 bit
 to
 say,
 "What's
 the
 strategic


rationale?"
 Because
 you
 you're
 tied
 on


labor.
 You
 you
 normally
 want
 to
 move
 up


the
 value
 chain.


And
 I
 think
 they
 realize
 that
 some
 of


these
 tariffs
 are
 also
 intended
 to
 help


generate
 revenue
 and
 reduce
 the
 deficit.


They
 understand
 that.
 They're
 just


questioning
 how
 strategic
 it
 is.
 Well,


let
 me
 ask
 you
 a
 question
 of
 the
 on
 the


question
 of
 what
 are
 we
 going
 to
 bring


back
 in
 the
 United
 States,
 if
 anything,


just
 from
 your
 perch
 at
 Goldman,
 do
 you


see
 any
 private
 money
 that's
 come
 into


the
 US
 for
 fresh
 sort
 of
 I
 don't
 know


green
 field
 capital
 investment
 either
 in


something
 low
 margin
 or
 high
 margin


because
 the
 terrorists
 have
 changed
 the


math
 and
 made
 that
 investment


economical.


>> So
 I
 will
 say
 there
 yes
 is
 the
 answer.


Uh
 I
 I
 think
 there
 are
 US
 companies
 that


will
 do
 more
 on
 the
 margin
 manufacturing


here.
 I've
 talked
 to
 overseas
 companies


including
 uh
 I
 won't
 mention
 the
 name
 of


one
 contract
 manufacturer
 in
 China.
 They


are
 building
 more
 in
 the
 United
 States.


And
 so
 the
 the
 thing
 is
 I
 don't
 know
 how


long
 it
 will
 take
 what
 the
 magnitude


will
 be.
 Uh
 but
 it
 yes
 it
 is
 happening.


The
 the
 flip
 side
 of
 that
 is
 there
 are


many
 companies
 in
 the
 US
 that
 benefited


from
 access
 to
 lowerc
 cost
 goods.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I
 won't
 mention
 their
 name
 but
 you


can
 you
 know
 some
 of
 them
 and
 they
 are


their
 margins
 are
 being
 squeezed
 and


then
 I
 talked
 to
 a
 number
 of
 small


businesses
 that
 don't
 have
 the
 leverage


to
 manage
 these
 tariffs
 and
 some
 of
 them


will
 actually
 go
 out
 of
 business
 or


considering
 it
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.


This
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an
 unfair


question,
 but
 I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 it


anyway.
 If
 you
 had
 to
 if
 you
 had
 to


choose
 one
 right
 now,
 would
 you
 say
 that


tariffs
 are
 more
 effective
 at
 bringing


back
 manufacturing
 to
 the
 US
 or
 more


effective
 at
 raising
 income
 for
 the
 US


government
 at
 a
 time
 when
 people
 are


worried
 about
 the
 deficit?


>> I
 think
 we'll
 start
 with
 the
 second


part.
 Uh
 tariffs


uh
 raise
 revenue,


but
 they
 slow
 growth.
 And
 so
 for
 every


dollar
 of
 tariff
 revenue,
 you
 have
 to


you
 have
 to
 accept
 you
 may
 give
 some


back
 and
 a
 little
 bit
 lower
 growth.
 I


think
 that
 trade
 is
 very
 much
 worth
 it.


Uh
 if
 you're
 bringing
 back
 high
 value


added
 manufacturing,
 I
 don't
 know
 if


it's
 such
 a
 good
 trade
 if
 you
 are


pushing
 to
 bring
 back
 lower
 value
 added.


I
 think
 this
 administration
 knows
 that


and
 I
 think
 they'll
 be
 more
 strategic.
 I


think
 you
 can
 do
 both.
 I
 I
 think
 you


could
 level
 the
 playing
 field,
 get
 get
 a


more
 tariff
 revenue
 or
 some
 level
 of


tariff
 revenue.
 Uh
 I
 think
 we
 were


thinking
 they
 were
 going
 to
 be
 closer
 to


10%
 than
 20%.
 You
 mean
 the
 high
 teens
 is


a
 little
 higher
 than
 we
 expected.
 And


you
 can
 also
 yes
 on
 semiconductors
 and


other
 strategic
 areas
 you
 can
 redomicile


those.
 I
 think
 the
 question
 is
 you
 sure


you
 want
 to
 go
 down
 the
 road
 of
 lumber


and
 aluminum,


>> right?
 or
 do
 you
 want
 to
 let
 Canada
 do


it?
 Is
 that
 a
 good
 strategic
 trade?
 I
 I


I'm
 not
 sure.


>> Since
 you
 mentioned
 it,
 why
 is
 the


neutral
 rate
 of
 interest
 to
 the
 extent


that
 we
 can
 form
 some
 educated
 guess
 as


to
 what
 it
 is,
 why
 is
 it
 so
 much
 higher


than
 it
 was
 in
 say
 2019
 in
 your
 view?


>> So,
 um


the
 the
 fact
 of
 the
 matter
 is
 I
 think
 if


you
 go
 way
 back
 in
 the
 stone
 age
 to


2019,


>> it
 does
 seem
 like
 forever
 ago.
 It
 does.


I
 think
 if
 we
 had
 not
 had
 CO


I
 think
 at
 the
 right
 before
 COVID
 hit


the
 10-year
 Treasury,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 in


the
 neighborhood
 of
 maybe
 1
 and
 3/4
 to


two.
 The
 Fed
 funds
 rate
 was
 in
 the
 mid


ones.
 I
 think
 we
 would
 have
 inched
 our


way
 up
 a
 little
 higher.


>> We
 didn't
 know
 how
 good
 we
 had
 it.
 All


those
 people
 were
 complaining,
 oh,


yields
 are
 so
 low.
 And
 then
 now
 they
 all


wish
 they
 could
 go
 back
 there.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 uh
 listen
 the
 inflation
 rate


today
 is
 stickier.
 Back
 in
 19
 it
 was


probably
 one
 and
 a
 half
 one
 and


three/4ers.
 I
 still
 think
 even
 then
 the


neutral
 rate
 real
 rate
 was
 3/4
 of
 1%.
 So


the
 neutral
 fed
 funds
 rate
 back
 then
 I


think
 was
 2
 1/2ish.
 Uh
 today
 it's
 closer


to
 3
 and
 1/2.
 But
 there's
 only
 one


reason
 for
 that.
 The
 inflation
 rate's


higher.
 If
 inflation
 got
 back
 down
 to


two,
 I
 think
 you'd
 see
 the
 neutral
 rate


back
 down
 to
 2
 and
 3/4.


[Music]


Since
 you
 mentioned
 sticky
 inflation,


there's
 one
 other
 thing
 that
 seems
 to
 be


top
 of
 mind
 at
 the
 moment,
 which
 is


Federal
 Reserve
 independence.
 Um,
 and
 we


should
 talk
 about
 that,
 but
 I
 guess
 we


can
 get
 your
 thoughts
 on,
 you
 know,
 that


specific
 idea
 in
 a
 second.
 But
 one
 thing


that
 seems
 surprising
 so
 far
 is
 that


we're
 having
 this
 debate
 about
 what


happens
 to
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 with
 what


seems
 to
 be
 a
 more
 activist
 Trump


administration
 that
 seems
 to
 want
 to


have
 a
 heavier
 hand
 in
 monetary
 policy.


We
 haven't
 really
 seen
 much
 much
 uh


response
 from
 the
 market.
 If
 you
 look
 at


the
 long
 end,
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 like


there's
 a
 big
 risk
 premium
 building


there.
 What's
 going
 on?
 So
 let's
 make


two
 comments.
 So
 regarding
 uh
 uh


political
 independence,
 let
 me
 just
 make


sure
 I
 I
 I
 uh
 frame
 this.
 Regulatory


policy
 at
 the
 Fed
 is
 not
 underlying
 not


politically
 independent.
 It
 hasn't
 been


for
 a
 number
 of
 years.
 What
 do
 I
 mean
 by


that?
 You
 get
 a
 new
 president.
 They
 pick


a
 new
 head
 of
 supervision
 and
 it's
 very


much
 has
 been
 influenced
 for
 the
 last


many
 years
 by
 whoever's
 in
 office.
 The


balance
 sheet
 I
 would
 argue
 is
 maybe
 a


little
 bit
 in
 the
 gray
 area
 on
 setting


the
 Fed
 funds
 rate
 though.
 The
 Fed
 has


been
 politically
 independent.
 Why
 is
 the


market
 you
 said
 not
 reacting
 more
 to


this?
 I
 mean
 the
 reality
 is
 the
 stock


market
 likes
 the
 idea
 of
 lower
 rates.
 I


think
 the
 thing
 it's
 not
 that
 the


markets
 aren't
 reacting.
 The
 stock


market
 likes
 it.
 So
 it's
 it's
 starting


now
 to
 take
 into
 account
 makes
 the
 real


acceleration
 you
 talked
 about
 more


likely.
 The
 gold
 market
 is
 very
 much


taken
 note
 of
 it
 and
 gold
 is
 up
 more


than
 35%
 year
 to
 date
 and
 I
 see
 it's
 up


another
 1%
 today.
 So
 it
 has
 and
 I


actually
 think
 duration
 on
 the
 long
 bond


while
 while
 the
 tenure
 is
 rallied


because
 of
 slow
 growth
 I
 still
 think
 we


have
 an
 issue.
 We've
 got
 37
 trillion
 of


debt
 to
 sell
 on
 our
 way
 to
 40
 trillion.


I
 I
 think
 that
 the
 bond
 market
 may
 pay


at
 the
 long
 end
 will
 pay
 attention
 to


how
 this
 uh
 current
 situation
 works
 out.


>> What
 is
 going
 on?
 Uh
 how
 much
 more
 gold


talk
 is
 there
 these
 days
 than
 there
 were


a
 few
 years
 ago?


>> Well,
 I
 I
 actually
 I've
 gone
 back
 over


looked
 back
 over
 the
 last
 50
 years.


When's
 the
 last
 time
 we
 got
 a
 rally
 in


gold
 like
 this?


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 a
 in
 the
 aftermath
 of
 the


great
 recession,
 remember
 in
 the
 great


recession
 the
 Fed
 took
 its
 balance
 sheet


from
 800
 uh
 billion
 to
 4
 trillion,
 okay?


And
 stopped
 and
 we
 started
 to
 run
 it


down
 a
 little
 bit.
 In
 response
 to
 COVID,


we
 went
 from
 4
 trillion
 to
 9
 trillion


and
 we
 authorized
 $6
 trillion
 of


extraordinary
 spending
 in
 a
 27
 trillion


economy.
 and
 the
 GDP
 uh
 the
 net
 debt
 to


GDP
 went
 from
 mid70s
 to
 over
 100%.
 When


you've
 got
 leverage
 in
 the
 United
 States


and
 to
 some
 some
 extent
 in
 the
 developed


world
 getting
 much
 higher
 in
 response
 to


co
 that's
 where
 people
 start
 to
 look
 at


gold,
 Bitcoin,
 other
 alternatives
 to


paper
 currency
 because
 they're
 worried


that
 this
 leveraging
 is
 just
 keeping


going
 on
 and
 on
 and
 on.
 And
 so
 it
 it's


understandable.


>> Wait,
 is
 it
 though?
 Because
 one
 of
 the


weird
 tensions
 of
 our
 current
 market


situation
 is
 we
 have
 US
 stocks
 at


all-time
 highs,
 but
 also
 gold
 making
 new


records
 almost
 every
 week.
 It
 feels
 like


those
 two
 things
 are
 incompatible,
 at


least
 in
 the
 long
 run.
 Um,
 you
 know,


maybe
 we
 could
 do
 it
 for
 a
 few
 weeks
 or


a
 few
 months,
 but
 someone's
 got
 to
 be


wrong
 here.
 I
 I
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time


talking
 to
 big
 institutions
 and
 about


asset
 allocation.
 I
 think
 and
 this
 is


our
 view
 also.
 Uh
 we
 think
 there
 could


be
 a
 reaceleration
 into
 26.
 We
 think
 the


AI
 boom
 is
 for
 real.
 We
 think
 we're


going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 productivity
 out


of
 AI.
 Okay,
 that
 is
 a
 good
 environment


for
 corporate
 earnings
 and
 for
 stocks.


What
 we
 don't
 know
 is
 how
 successful


we're
 going
 to
 be
 on
 bending
 the
 curve


of
 debt
 to
 GDP.
 Are
 we
 going
 to
 run


another
 $2
 trillion
 deficit
 even
 with


tariffs?
 Is
 it
 going
 to
 be
 higher?
 And


in
 that
 regard,
 I
 think
 people
 can
 buy


stocks
 and
 buy
 gold
 and
 be
 very
 careful


about
 buying
 the
 10-year
 and
 the
 30-year


Treasury.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 kind
 of


what
 we're
 seeing.


>> Actually,
 I
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 your


point
 about
 sort
 of
 uh
 globalization
 is


happening
 with
 us
 or
 without
 us.
 There's


a
 different
 approach
 to
 AI
 diffusion
 out


of
 China
 than
 there
 is
 in
 the
 US.
 But


when
 you
 go
 around
 the
 world,
 are
 the


American
 providers
 of
 tech,
 whether
 it's


cloud
 tech
 or
 whether
 it's
 Microsoft


etc.
 are
 they
 still
 are
 they
 going
 to


win
 even
 if
 the
 US
 isn't
 part
 of
 that


globalization
 wave?
 Will
 US
 tech
 still


be
 part
 of
 the
 story
 because
 so
 much
 is


riding
 on
 the
 ongoing
 earnings
 power
 of


seven
 companies?


>> So
 I'll
 make
 a
 general
 comp
 comment


about
 US
 companies
 generally.
 A
 typical


CEO
 in
 the
 United
 States
 that
 runs
 a


global
 company
 has
 probably
 been
 to


Europe
 in
 their
 careers
 75
 times
 or
 more


and
 has
 been
 to
 Asia
 75
 times,
 has
 been


to
 China
 multiple
 times,
 has
 built


relationships
 and
 has
 been
 doing
 it
 for


years.
 Um,
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 true
 of


tech,
 no
 doubt.


>> Uh,
 many
 of
 the
 tech
 leaders
 you
 see
 are


overseas
 regularly.
 our
 political


leaders
 and
 and
 some
 of
 our
 leaders
 in


certain
 governmental
 positions
 uh
 maybe


have
 not
 been
 to
 China
 or
 overseas
 quite


as
 much
 and
 that's
 why
 you
 see
 during


periods
 like
 this
 the
 corporate
 world
 is


continuing
 to
 chug
 along
 and
 build


relationships
 globally
 even
 though
 at
 at


national
 level
 we're
 sort
 of
 reorienting


and
 trying
 to
 um
 bring
 more
 to
 the


United
 States
 and
 in
 effect
 deglobalize.


So
 we've
 got
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 dichotomy
 and


it
 it
 it
 stands
 in
 sharp
 relief.
 This
 is


the
 same
 way
 even
 8
 years
 ago
 where
 we


withdrew
 from
 the
 Paris
 climate
 accord,


>> right?


>> And
 yet
 companies
 in
 the
 United
 States


from
 my
 to
 my
 eye
 did
 not
 slow
 down
 at


all
 in
 trying
 to
 build
 lead
 certified


buildings
 and
 focus
 on
 greenhouse
 gas


emissions
 and
 sustainability.


You
 talked
 earlier
 about
 the
 difference


between
 how
 China
 and
 the
 US
 um
 the


corporate
 sphere
 is
 actually
 using
 AI.


When
 you're
 looking
 at
 the
 US
 and
 you're


looking
 for
 signs
 that
 AI
 is
 actually


having
 a
 definitive,
 you
 know,


needlemoving
 impact
 on
 US
 productivity,


what
 are
 you
 looking
 for
 here?
 What
 are


the
 signs?


>> I'm
 looking
 for
 adoption


in
 a
 broad
 set
 of
 industries
 because


here's
 here's
 how
 this
 works.
 First,


your
 company
 gets
 you
 to
 try
 it.
 Okay.


And
 you
 adopt
 it.
 Second
 thing
 you
 try


is
 various
 use
 cases
 based
 on
 that


adoption.
 And
 then
 third
 thing
 you


figure
 out
 which
 use
 cases
 work
 and


which
 use
 cases
 don't
 work.
 We're
 kind


of
 in
 that
 phase
 right
 now
 in
 the
 United


States.
 When
 I
 say
 China's
 a
 little


farther
 ahead,
 I
 think
 they've
 already


tried
 and
 proven
 some
 of
 the
 use
 cases


in
 more
 industry.
 We'll
 get
 there
 too.


But
 but
 you'll
 know
 when
 we
 look
 back
 10


years
 from
 now.
 My
 guess
 is
 maybe
 not
 as


fast
 as
 other
 parts
 of
 the
 world.
 We


will
 have
 gone
 through
 all
 that.
 We'll


know
 which
 use
 cases
 work,
 which
 don't.


We'll
 adopt
 them.
 We're
 going
 to
 get
 a


lot
 more
 efficiencies.
 There
 may
 be
 as


many
 or
 more
 jobs,
 but
 they're
 going
 to


shift
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to


redeploy
 people
 to
 where
 the
 open
 jobs


are,
 but
 we
 have
 to
 go
 through
 that


whole
 cycle.
 And
 I
 would
 say
 we're


early.
 We're
 early
 in
 that.


>> We
 just
 have
 a
 couple
 minutes
 left.


Here's
 something
 that's
 been
 on
 my
 mind


a
 little
 bit
 lately
 that
 I
 would
 like


your
 take
 on.
 How
 levered
 to
 the
 stock


market
 is
 the
 real
 US
 economy?
 How
 much


when
 you
 look
 around
 does
 it
 feel
 like


things
 are
 dependent
 on
 these
 companies


continuing
 to
 deliver
 year
 after
 year


and
 positive
 asset
 returns?


>> So
 that's
 a
 great
 question.
 So
 I
 would


say
 the
 US
 is
 75%
 a
 service
 economy.
 It


is
 a
 very
 heavily
 consumer-driven


economy.
 This
 which
 makes
 our
 economy


different
 from
 many
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 if


you
 break
 down
 the
 consumer
 here,
 half


the
 workers
 in
 this
 country,
 let's
 take


it
 8085
 million,
 make
 $50,000
 a
 year,


are
 unlikely
 to
 have
 financial
 assets,


have
 lost
 25%
 plus
 purchasing
 power,
 and


are
 struggling
 to
 make
 ends
 meet.


They're
 spending
 every
 dollar
 they
 make.


But
 if
 you're
 a
 business
 that
 serves


them,
 you're
 seeing
 they're
 being
 very


careful.


>> Yeah.
 There's
 another
 80
 85
 million


consumers
 tend
 to
 be
 I'm
 exagger
 I'm


generalizing
 55
 and
 older
 own
 their
 home


have
 financial
 assets
 and
 and
 they've


made
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 in
 the
 markets
 to


your
 point
 and
 they're
 spending
 because


they're
 getting
 wealthier
 and
 we've
 got


a
 tale
 of
 two
 consumer
 groups.
 I
 think


part
 of
 what
 this
 administration,
 I


believe,
 is
 trying
 to
 do
 is
 help
 lift
 up


this
 first
 group
 so
 that
 they
 can
 be
 uh


more
 affluent
 and
 do
 better
 because


right
 now
 we're
 very
 heavily
 dependent


on
 this
 second
 engine
 based
 on
 the
 stock


market.


>> All
 right,
 I'm
 going
 to
 sneak
 in
 one


more
 question
 and
 go
 back
 to
 where
 we


started
 this
 conversation,
 which
 is
 on


rate
 cuts.
 I
 know
 you
 said
 uh
 50
 basis


point
 probably
 not
 on
 the
 table,
 but


your
 your
 gut
 instinct,
 is
 this
 going
 to


be
 the
 start
 of
 a
 rate
 cycle,
 a
 rate
 cut


cycle
 that
 goes
 into
 the
 next
 year,


2026,
 or
 is
 this
 something
 that,
 you


know,
 maybe
 you
 get
 one
 rate
 cut,
 maybe


you
 get
 two
 rate
 cuts,
 but
 it's
 not


going
 to
 go
 on
 for
 much
 longer
 than


that.


>> I
 think
 it
 will
 be,
 if
 it's
 a
 cycle,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 halting
 cycle.
 What


do
 I
 mean
 by
 that?
 Cut
 25
 in
 September.


I
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 happen.
 Wipe
 the


slate
 clean
 for
 the
 next
 6
 weeks.
 Fed


meets
 every
 6
 weeks.
 Wipe
 the
 slate


clean.
 Make
 sure
 that
 you're
 convinced


still
 the
 labor
 market
 is
 weak.
 Check


inflation.
 If
 it's
 continued
 to
 be
 weak


and
 inflation
 is
 at least
 moderate,
 you


may
 do
 another
 one.
 Uh
 the
 issue
 I'm


pointing
 out
 is
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 have


more
 room
 to
 get
 to
 neutral
 than
 75
 to


100
 basis
 points.
 So
 might
 we
 wind
 up


doing
 two
 or
 three
 this
 year?
 Maybe.
 Are


we
 going
 to
 wind
 up
 doing
 150
 200
 base


points?
 It
 means
 you
 would
 want
 you


would
 have
 to
 decide
 which
 I
 don't
 see
 a


justification
 for
 running
 a
 very


stimulative
 monetary
 policy.
 And
 I
 think


the
 Fed
 as
 it's
 currently
 configured


will
 be
 enormously
 reluctant
 to
 to
