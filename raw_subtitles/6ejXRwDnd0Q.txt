From
 the
 New
 [music]
 York
 Times,
 it's


the
 headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.


Today's
 Wednesday,
 January
 7th.
 Here's


what
 we're
 covering.


From
 the
 moment
 President
 Trump


announced
 that
 the
 US
 had
 seized


Venezuelan
 President
 Nicholas
 Maduro,


his
 administration
 has
 been
 talking
 up


the
 potential
 of
 the
 country's
 vast
 oil


reserves.
 Venezuela
 has
 the
 largest


proven
 oil
 reserve
 in
 the
 world.
 Look,


oil
 is
 critical.


>> What
 we
 want
 to
 do
 is
 fix
 up
 the
 oil,


fix
 up
 the
 country.


>> Now,
 Trump
 claims
 Venezuela
 will
 start


handing
 over
 some
 of
 that
 oil
 to
 the
 US.


In
 a
 social
 media
 post
 yesterday,
 he


said
 the
 country
 will
 ship
 roughly
 2
 to3


billion
 worth
 of
 oil,
 though
 it's
 not


clear
 what,
 if
 anything,
 Venezuela
 will


get
 in
 return.
 Trump
 said
 he
 would


control
 the
 profits
 from
 selling
 it
 to


quote
 benefit
 the
 people
 of
 Venezuela


and
 the
 United
 States.
 Trump
 has
 also


said
 he's
 going
 to
 clear
 the
 path
 for


American
 oil
 companies
 to
 start
 more


production
 in
 Venezuela.
 He's
 set
 to


meet
 with
 oil
 executives
 in
 Washington


later
 this
 week.
 Meanwhile,
 the
 Times


has
 learned
 that
 the
 White
 House
 is


making
 other
 demands
 on
 Venezuela.
 US


officials
 say
 Secretary
 of
 State
 Marco


Rubio
 had
 a
 classified
 meeting
 this
 week


with
 Deli
 Rodriguez,
 the
 country's


interim
 president,
 in
 which
 he
 demanded


that
 she
 expel
 Chinese,
 Russian,
 Cuban,


and
 Iranian
 advisers
 and
 military


personnel.
 But
 in
 the
 face
 of
 the


administration's
 ongoing
 claims
 that
 the


US
 is
 in
 charge,
 Venezuelan
 leaders
 are


publicly
 striking
 a
 defiant
 tone.


In
 a
 speech
 yesterday,
 Rodriguez
 said,


quote,
 "The
 government
 of
 Venezuela
 runs


our
 country,
 no
 one
 else."
 A
 large
 crowd


also
 marched
 through
 the
 streets
 of
 the


capital,
 Caracus,
 demanding
 Maduro's


release.
 And
 people
 say
 there's
 an


effort
 on
 the
 ground
 in
 Venezuela
 to


root
 out
 anyone
 who
 supported
 the
 US


raid
 with
 armed
 government
 forces


stopping
 people
 at
 checkpoints
 to
 search


their
 cell
 phones.


Now,
 a
 few
 more
 quick
 updates
 on
 the


Trump
 administration.


With
 President
 Trump
 emboldened
 by
 the


capture
 of
 Maduro,
 he
 and
 his
 team
 are


doubling
 down
 on
 their
 threats
 to


acquire
 Greenland.
 [music]
 The
 Times
 has


learned
 that
 this
 week
 Trump
 told
 his


aids
 to
 deliver
 an
 updated
 plan
 for


bringing
 the
 territory
 under
 US
 control.


And
 in
 a
 briefing
 with
 lawmakers,
 Marco


Rubio
 said
 the
 president
 plans
 [music]


to
 try
 and
 purchase
 it,
 though
 he
 didn't


give
 any
 details.
 Trump
 has
 talked
 about


taking
 over
 Greenland
 since
 his
 [music]


first
 term,
 framing
 it
 as
 a
 national


security
 priority.
 It's
 rich
 in
 rare


earth
 minerals
 and
 located
 in
 the
 Arctic


Circle,
 where
 the
 US,
 Russia,
 and
 China


are
 fighting
 for
 control.
 In
 a
 joint


statement
 released
 yesterday,
 the


leaders
 of
 [music]
 France,
 Germany,


Britain,
 and
 other
 countries
 pushed
 back


on
 the
 Trump
 administration,
 writing,


quote,
 "greenland
 belongs
 to
 its


people."


Also,
 [music]
 in
 a
 speech
 to
 House


Republicans,


>> "You
 got
 to
 win
 the
 midterms,
 cuz
 if
 we


don't
 win
 the
 midterms,


it's
 just
 going
 to
 be


I
 mean,
 they'll
 find
 a
 reason
 to
 impeach


[music]
 me."
 President
 Trump
 sounded
 the


alarm
 about
 the
 midterm
 elections,


saying
 he
 expects
 Democrats
 to
 pick
 up


seats
 in
 the
 fall,
 potentially
 setting


the
 stage
 for
 his
 third
 impeachment.
 As


of
 yesterday,
 Republicans
 razor
 thin


majority
 in
 the
 House
 got
 even
 slimmer


after
 Marjorie
 Taylor
 Green
 resigned
 and


Doug
 Lamalfa
 of
 California
 died
 during


an
 emergency
 surgery.


And
 [music]
 on
 the
 fifth
 anniversary
 of


a
 proTrump
 mob
 attacking
 the
 US
 capital,


the
 administration
 made
 its
 most
 brazen


effort
 yet
 to
 rewrite
 the
 history
 of
 the


riot.
 The
 White
 House
 posted
 a
 new
 page


on
 its
 website
 yesterday
 that
 blames


Capitol
 police
 officers
 for
 starting
 the


assault
 and
 blames
 Democrats,
 who
 were


the
 main
 targets
 of
 the
 violence,
 for


failing
 to
 prevent
 it.
 The
 site
 also


lists
 out
 the
 names
 of
 several


right-wing
 members
 of
 the
 crowd
 who
 died


during
 or
 in
 connection
 with
 the


assault,
 but
 it
 contains
 no
 references


to
 the
 nearly
 140
 police
 officers
 who


were
 injured
 that
 day
 or
 those
 who
 died


in
 the
 aftermath.


One
 year
 ago
 today,
 wildfires
 erupted
 in


Los
 Angeles,
 destroying
 much
 of
 Altadena


and
 the
 Pacific
 Palisades.
 At
 least
 31


people
 were
 killed,
 and
 nearly
 80
 square


miles
 of
 neighborhoods
 and
 businesses


were
 obliterated.
 Now,
 people
 whose


homes
 didn't
 burn
 are
 confronting
 a


different
 danger.
 Contamination
 from
 the


smoke
 of
 everything
 that
 went
 up
 in


flames,
 tires
 and
 metals
 and
 plastics.
 A


New
 Times
 investigation
 traced
 how
 one


family
 ended
 up
 back
 in
 a
 toxic
 house


and
 how
 many
 others
 may
 be
 facing
 the


same
 reality.


After
 the
 fire,
 Jeff
 Vaness
 and
 Kathleen


Pineda
 spent
 7
 months
 in
 a
 hotel
 with


their
 two
 kids
 while
 insurance
 paid
 for


a
 professional
 cleaning
 of
 their
 house.


Afterwards,
 the
 company
 Farmers


Insurance
 said
 tests
 showed
 it
 was
 safe.


The
 family
 wasn't
 sure.
 Kathleen
 had
 a


previous
 cancer
 diagnosis
 and
 their
 kids


were
 little.
 They
 didn't
 want
 to
 take


any
 risks,
 so
 they
 paid
 for
 their
 own


test,
 which
 showed
 concerning
 levels
 of


lead.
 [music]
 But
 farmers
 dismissed
 that


and
 stopped
 paying
 for
 the
 hotel.
 By


August,
 the
 family
 felt
 like
 they
 had
 no


choice
 but
 to
 move
 back
 and
 just
 try
 to


keep
 cleaning,
 mopping,
 and
 wiping


absolutely
 everything
 constantly.
 To


understand
 whether
 that
 was
 safe,
 the


Times
 asked
 the
 family
 this
 fall
 for


permission
 to
 test
 for
 contaminants
 and


to
 collect
 hair
 samples
 to
 measure
 their


potential
 exposure.
 The
 results:


Everyone's
 hair
 showed
 a
 measurable


spike
 in
 heavy
 metals
 after
 they
 moved


back
 in.
 Their
 daughter's
 hair
 had
 10


times
 the
 normal
 levels
 of
 arsenic,
 and


lead
 readings
 showed
 [music]
 27
 times


the
 federal
 limit
 of
 the
 heavy
 metal


near
 the
 refrigerator.
 The
 Times
 asked


10
 health
 experts
 to
 review
 the
 results.


All
 of
 them
 said
 that
 the
 remediation


that
 insurance
 had
 covered
 wasn't


sufficient.
 [music]


The
 Van
 Ness's
 story
 is
 almost
 certainly


not
 a
 one-off
 since
 there
 is
 no
 state
 or


federal
 standard
 for
 how
 an
 insurance


company
 should
 clean
 a
 house
 after
 smoke


damage.
 And
 the
 Times
 found
 that
 the


standard
 the
 insurance
 industry
 uses


relies
 in
 part
 on
 research
 papers
 that


either
 haven't
 been
 peer-
 reviewed
 or


were
 funded
 by
 the
 industry
 itself.
 One


public
 health
 expert
 described
 it
 as


science
 for
 hire.
 Toxicologists
 say
 that


to
 truly
 decontaminate
 a
 house,
 you'd


have
 to
 remove
 every
 surface
 the
 smoke


touched.
 the
 hardwood
 floors,
 the
 tiles,


plaster,
 stucco,
 a
 process
 that
 would
 be


far,
 far
 more
 expensive
 than
 the
 roughly


$25,000
 of
 cleaning
 that
 farmers
 covered


for
 the
 Vaness
 family.
 In
 response
 to


questions
 from
 the
 Times,
 farmers
 said


every
 claim
 is
 evaluated
 on
 an


individual
 basis
 and
 that
 it
 couldn't


comment
 on
 individual
 cases.


We're
 still
 on
 the
 ocean,
 of
 course,
 but


the
 landscape
 has
 changed
 entirely.


>> And
 finally,


>> we're
 starting
 to
 see
 wildlife.
 Seen
 a


few
 penguins,
 few
 seals
 already.


>> Times
 climate
 reporter
 Raymond
 Jang
 and


photographer
 Chang
 Lee
 are
 on
 a
 nearly


twomonlong
 expedition
 sailing
 to


Antarctica.


>> So,
 it's
 a
 big
 morning
 for
 us
 on
 the


ship.
 We
 have
 just
 entered
 the
 sea
 ice


zone
 around
 Antarctica
 and
 I'm
 going to


>> They've
 joined
 a
 team
 of
 about
 40


researchers
 from
 around
 the
 world
 on
 an


icebreaker
 headed
 towards
 Thuait.
 It's
 a


glacier
 the
 size
 of
 Florida
 that's
 more


than
 a
 mile
 thick
 and
 it
 is
 melting


fast.


>> Just
 because
 of
 the
 way
 Thuait
 is


situated,
 it
 just
 sort
 of
 is
 like
 this


cork
 in
 the
 bottle.
 If
 the
 thuates


really
 starts
 to
 disintegrate,
 break
 up,


flow
 really
 quickly
 out
 to
 sea,
 then
 you


could
 start
 seeing
 a
 lot
 more
 glaciers


around
 it
 doing
 the
 same.


>> Ry
 says
 that
 the
 scientists
 are
 planning


to
 gather
 data
 from
 Thuaits
 to
 better


understand
 Antarctica's
 melting


glaciers,
 which
 are
 already
 starting
 to


push
 up
 sea
 levels.

 are

 headlines

today
 on

 daily.


>> I
 would
 say
 that
 Democrats
 are
 broadly


filled
 [music]
 with
 an
 anxious
 optimism.


A
 look
 at
 how
 Democrats
 and
 Republicans


are
 strategizing
 and
 [music]
 bracing
 for


the
 midterm
 elections.


>> I
 think
 that
 dreading
 is
 the
 correct


word
 here.
 Republicans
 ended
 last
 year


[music]


feeling
 very
 pessimistic
 about
 their


chance
 of
 holding
 on
 to
 control
 of
 the


House.
