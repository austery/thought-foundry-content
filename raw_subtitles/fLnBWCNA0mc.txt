In 2021, Baidu's last article "Lying Flat is Justice" suddenly became popular
less than a day
All online comments related to lying flat are blocked by the Chinese government
same period
A young American tweets 'I don't want a career'
Get nearly 400,000 likes
The concept of lying down has also begun to appear in English
goblin mode
It means A Zhai who doesn't care about worldly eyes
This word even became Oxford's 2022 word of the year
Last year, Lai Qingde visited college students in Taiwan
It was found that 40% of the students wished to lie flat
Unemployment rate among young people in China topped 20% last month
Why is the lie flat movement resonating with young people around the world?
even become a cultural trend
Why can't the older generation understand the Buddhist attitude of the young?
Today we are going to face the book "Collective Burnout"
Let's talk about millennial youth
Why hate work and choose to lie flat?
Is it because young people are not as good as one generation after another?
Or is there something wrong with society?
In 2019, a buzzword suddenly appeared on the Internet
It's called OK boomer
Used to ridicule the elderly who don't understand the suffering of young people
Treat young people as strawberry family, low stress resistance
say what you want, old man
ok old man
The post-war baby generation refers to those born roughly between 1946-1964
The age of these people is about 55-75 years old
Like America's Trump
Taiwan's Tsai Ing-wen, Ke Wenzhe, Hou Youyi, Guo Taiming
These guys are baby boomers
Federal Reserve Research Finds
Post-war babies have 20% more net worth at the same age as millennials
That is, the money your parents earn at the age of 30 is 20% more than the money you earn at the age of 30
Why capitalism developed for half a century
Are young people poorer than previous generations?
Cause these old people do not understand the plight of young people now?
Because the post-war baby generation actually hitched a ride
During the Great Depression in the United States in the 1930s
President Roosevelt signs the National Labor Relations Act
Let workers legally form unions
Collective bargaining with business groups
even a strike
These will be protected by law
This allows workers to fight for a safe working environment
more favorable salary
The system of overtime pay and pension also appeared at this time
The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 provides
If working more than 44 hours
Employers must pay overtime
more importantly
The political and business ruling class at that time
In order to prevent the economic crisis from happening again
will make people lose faith in capitalism
the concept of social welfare
want to diversify risk
If an economic crisis occurs
I have to bear all the responsibility
that's too risky
should be distributed to all citizens
take this risk together
This is the origin of national social welfare and insurance benefits
So the postwar baby boomers are doing well
because the parents of the Depression generation
when they were born
At the same time, it created a good economic environment for them
The 20 years after the war were arguably the most equitable distribution of wealth in American history
In 1950, the salary of the American CEO was only 20 times that of the average employee
But now it's up to 400 times
20 years of economic prosperity after the war
Massive expansion of the American middle class
So the economic historian Louis Hyman said:
The social atmosphere at the time was so optimistic that
Capitalism works for almost everyone
The ideology of the American Dream was forged during this time
This environment makes people feel comfortable with the status quo
feel that capitalism works well
And after economic stability
The overall population is more confident
There is also more leeway to challenge social injustice
Like women's liberation, gay destigmatization, and the anti-Vietnam war movement
appeared during this period
This leads conservative sociologist Robert Nisbet to say:
Postwar baby boomers are the 'spoiled generation'
Parents of the Depression Generation
I have suffered
I don't want my children to suffer too
hope to give them a better life
Empowering children to pursue the American Dream
This leads to more selfish postwar baby boomers
Self-centered, don't care about others
But after the 1970s
Capitalism begins to shift
The U.S. government and capitalists began to advocate
The Personal Responsibility Crusade
responsibility for economic risk
From government capital to labor
The government doesn't care too much
To allow the individual to bear the failure
Yale political scientist Jacob Hacker calls this the "Great Risk Shift."
Most obviously reflected in social benefits, pensions, and corporate training
The Reagan administration began to demonize social welfare
Says poor people on unemployment benefits are 'welfare queens'
<font color=#FFF700FF>For the first time in our nation's history,</font>
<font color=#FFF700FF>For the first time in our nation's history,</font>
<font color=#FFF700FF>Millions of Americans became virtual wards of the state</font>
<font color=#FFF700FF>millions of Americans became virtual wards of the state,</font>
<font color=#FFF700FF>Trapped in a cycle of welfare dependency</font>
<font color=#FFF700FF>trapped in a cycle of welfare dependency</font>
<font color=#FFF700FF>that robs them of dignity and opportunity</font>
<font color=#FFF700FF>that robs them of dignity and opportunity.</font>
The government provides welfare subsidies for the poor
It will only make these poor people less willing to work
instead contributes to poverty
government should stop
Let the most efficient free market work
solve all social problems
So the U.S. government started cutting taxes for the rich
Suppression of trade union forces
This set of rhetoric about risk transfer has also won the support of the public
Because after the civil rights movement and the women's movement in the 1960s
Blacks, women start to enter the workplace
lead to a more competitive work environment
Middle-class white male postwar baby boomers feel precarious
Want to keep your class position
So start blocking people from getting benefits
Prevent others from taking the position of the middle class
Many people are turning to the right
vote for the reagan government
Then the concept of pension has also changed
The original intent of the pension was
you make money for the company long term
Therefore, the company's profits should be shared with employees for a few more years after retirement
Instead of giving profits to shareholders and CEOs
But since the great risk shift in the 1980s
Pension system hit by capitalists
The capitalists began to propagate a new idea
You need to plan your retirement early
If you can't afford retirement
That's because you don't know how to manage money and save money
You don't care about money, money doesn't care about you
Don't always think about relying on the boss's pension
Before 1980, 46% of American workers were in a pension plan
By 2019, only 16% of U.S. workers will be able to enjoy pensions
In Taiwan, however, it was found that
People think they should start saving for retirement after the age of 38
According to the latest statistics from the Bureau of Labor Insurance
Among the 1.46 million retired employees currently receiving monthly labor insurance annuities
950,000 retired workers receive less than 20,000 yuan a month
Only the employer contributes 6% of the monthly salary for the labor pension
Simply not enough to support retirement
In the end, you still have to invest your own money
Finally, even the corporate responsibility for training has been privatized.
Companies that used to hire workers without a college degree
Pre-employment training after hire
Like a receptionist in an accounting firm who can train to be an accountant
Or mining companies will fund university engineering department scholarships
It is equivalent to the indirect sponsorship of students by enterprises
encourage students to read
Therefore, the cost of training is borne by the enterprise.
But after the big risk transfer
Training becomes a personal responsibility
You have to pay your own money to go to university and take a test certificate
Cultivate a second specialty and sign up for online courses
This seems very strange to people before the 80s
Obviously these trainings are ultimately beneficial to the company
Why are you raising money yourself?
Employers don't need to spend half a dime
And you pay your own money to go to college to learn a trade
not necessarily find a job
Only a handful of jobs left today offer on-the-job training
like the solar panel industry
Or a high-paying white-collar job, the boss may give you money to study an MBA
Or being a soldier, which means paying your salary to train you
This chain of risk transfers
The ideology of personal responsibility is presupposed
This is very American in itself
Because the founding spirit of the United States is to colonize new places and be self-reliant
Those who survive are the most successful
as an american proverb would say
"Pull yourself up by your bootstraps" (lift yourself up by your bootstraps)
means self-reliance
But this happens to ignore
Post-war baby generations can stand on their own feet
hard work pays off
Because the previous generation helped them create a good environment
Instead, after the boomers of the post-war generation squeezed out economic resources
Leave our generation with a very bad environment
pay for college
No social welfare, no pension
but don't forget
These postwar babies are actually our parents
They are looking at our generation
grew up in a very bad social environment
This makes these parents actually very anxious
So in order for the next generation to keep the dominant class position
These parents give their children more education from an early age
As a result, this constitutes a source of burnout among contemporary youth.
In 1980, many children disappeared suddenly in the United States
Missing children will be printed on milk cartons
For example, the American drama "Stranger Things" is set during this time
Cultural Anxiety Reflecting Child Disappearance
But actually
In the 1980s, there were not really more cases of missing children than before
So why is America caught up in this fear of missing children?
actually because
American parents become more eager to control their children
So whenever there is a case of a missing child
It will be magnified and inspected by parents across the country
Make these parents want to closely monitor every move of their children
Because they were all born in the golden age of the expansion of the American middle class
When these people grow up and start a family
But found it more and more difficult to keep children in the middle class
so more anxious
Hope to strengthen children's class through the power of upbringing and education
This instead makes children born in the 90s
feeling stressed since childhood
The source of their burnout is their parents
Sociologist Annette Lareau did a study in the 1990s
Tracked 88 children from different socioeconomic backgrounds
Discover middle-class and working-class families
have a very different view of education
Education in middle-class families is planned and cultivated
Teach children to question authority, learn to negotiate, learn talent
These abilities happen to be valued by the campus and the workplace
It is equivalent to parental education is already engaging in an arms race
Help children enter good schools in the future
get ready for a job
by contrast
The education of the working class is to let the children grow up naturally
free-range education
Parents are so busy at work that they don't bother to take care of their children
But after 2000 there was a trend
TV show starts asking education experts to promote 'correct' parenting
Middle-class education is held up as a model
Even working-class families are learning
Start to let children take tutoring, learn talents, and participate in summer camps
Desire is for children to be promoted to the middle class
But the consequence of this is that there are more and more helicopter parents
Overprotecting children and planning their time well
But never teach children how to use their free time
Instead, keep finding things to fill up the spare time
So millennial kids are being pushed to death by their parents from a young age
It wasn't until I entered university that I was suddenly forced to find out my interests and aspirations
don't know what it is
The first choice to go to medical school, law school is not because I really like it
but to maintain a middle-class lifestyle
The same America in the 1970-1980s
50% drop in English majors
Triple the number of people majoring in business
because of class anxiety
Leading more and more people to choose safe departments
This whole set of education concept changes
Getting millennials to simplify their lives to just a resume
Each stage is working hard for the next stage
This has led to a lot of psychological costs for the younger generation
Stressed-out students may choose to commit suicide
Taiwan's teenage suicide rate triples in past 10 years
Some people become overachievers
no matter what you have achieved
as if never enough
Some people lose their original enthusiasm for doing things
Because when your interests and hobbies become capital and put them on the university examination materials
will lose its original meaning
The result is that entrance exams and interviews cannot really reflect a person's ability
It just reflects that you are good at exams
I can show my perfect self
This has led to many college students suffering from "imposter syndrome"
Many people feel unworthy after being admitted to National Taiwan University
When you base your self-worth on academic achievement
Since I was a child, I have always been number one
After being admitted to National Taiwan University
But it is competing with the first place in all parts of Taiwan
Finding that I'm no longer number one in my class
Self-worth is instantly devalued
So what makes millennials different from previous generations
It's because we're forced to turn ourselves into college application bots
But after being admitted to a good university, we did not get the "successful life" promised by our parents and society
Then what I have worked hard for for 20 years is nothing.
I might as well lie down
etc.
the touch of this bed
Could it be...
Original memory foam mattress from Emma, ​​Germany

Zzz...
millennial kids
I was forced by my parents to be admitted to a good school when I was a child
But after really leaving the society
What they are facing is selling livers, becoming "community animals", and working as disposable laborers
Why have a good college degree
Young people still work to death
because in the 21st century
A new view of work begins to emerge
do a job you love
The most classic example
It was 2005
Speech by Jobs at Stanford University Commencement Ceremony
<font color=#FFD900FF>I believe that I can go today</font>
<font color=#FFD900FF>I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going</font>
<font color=#FFD900FF>was that i loved what i did
.</font>
<font color=#FFD900FF>You have to find what you love</font>
<font color=#FFD900FF>You've got to find what you love.</font>
<font color=#FFD900FF>Your work occupies a large part of your life</font>
<font color=#FFD900FF>your work is going to fill a large part of your life</font>
<font color=#FFD900FF>Then life must be able to be satisfied</font>
<font color=#FFD900FF>and the only way to be truly satisfied</font>
<font color=#FFD900FF>is to do
what you believe is great work.</font>
<font color=#FFD900FF>And the only way to do great work is to love what you do</font>
<font color=#FFD900FF>And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. </font>
<font color=#FFD900FF>If you haven't found it yet, keep looking and don't
settle .</font>
As if you only need to find a job you love and work hard
You'll be the next Steve Jobs
But this masks the reality of capitalism
just because you love the job
So can tolerate all kinds of exploitation at work
when you do what you love
you won't feel like you're working
So there is no difference between commuting and commuting
It's like you are working 24 hours a day
And it was you who voluntarily made the hours longer
if you don't
It means you don't love the job enough
"Do a job you love"
Can also be used to weaken the class consciousness of workers
Like many companies will claim to treat employees as family
Work hard together and do what you love
But think about it if you treat your boss like family
Do you dare to ask your family for a raise?
do what you love
It can also be used to justify base salary
For example, when Disneyland recruits employees,
require employees to love everything about Disney
Let employees feel that working at Disney is already a kind of enjoyment
Should not ask for higher salary
Or now companies have unwritten rules
Offer unpaid internship opportunities
Let you show how much you love this industry
Can be used as a springboard for the future
If you don't go for an internship
already lost to other competitors
This is tantamount to asking everyone to do unpaid labor in disguise.
Salaried employment in the future
The study found that between 2006 and 2013
In the words of American recruitment advertisements
Eightfold increase in words using "Rockstar"
Because companies know to rationalize the base salary
You need to use some flamboyant words to recruit people
make you think this job is cool
you will love this job
do not count salary
"Turning a passion into a job" is now deeply embedded in our culture
<font color=#FFF300FF>Do you know why kids like athletes? </font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>You know why kids love athletes?</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>Because they can sleep with lingerie models? </font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>I don't know. Cause they screw lingerie models?</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>No, that's why we love athletes.</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>No., that's why we love athletes.</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>Kids love athletes because they follow their dreams</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>Kids love athletes because they follow their dreams</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>How much does your company pay you to give up your dream? </font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>How much did they first pay to give up on your dreams?</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>Twenty seven grand a year</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>Twenty seven grand a year.</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>When will you stop and go back to doing what you love? </font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>And when were you gonna stop and come back and do what makes you happy?</font>
When we see someone is good at something
They will say that you can make money from this in the future.
People who are good at playing video games should become e-sports players when they grow up
Otherwise it's a waste of your talent
But this kind of thinking is actually very Protestant.
Sociologist Max Weber thinks
Capitalism could have arisen in Western Europe in the 16th century
Because at that time after the Reformation
Protestants see love of work as answer to God's call
Advocate to regard work as a mission and vocation
The best way to glorify God is to work hard
When you succeed in your business and make a lot of money
It means you are God's Chosen One
In today's 21st century
capitalism once again promotes this value
do a job you love
but the difference is
Today's young people have seen clearly how capitalism works
The sense of purpose at work is just masking the exploitation
Plus people born after 2000
After graduating from university, I just encountered the new crown epidemic and couldn't find a job
so capitalism promises them
there's no way to actually make it happen
why don't you just lie down
Many people think that lying flat is because of low wages
But in fact, people in high-paying industries also want to lie flat
Because whether you are low-paid or high-paid
you all work to death
have you ever felt like this
I feel like your job isn't as fun as it used to be
oh honestly i have
really why
Because of work
Since when did overtime burnout become a work ethic?
This work ethic has two sources
one after World War II
America's Silicon Valley high-tech industry begins to sing the praises of burnout culture
<font color=#FFED00FF>He was on
a 36-hour coding tear, </font>
<font color=#FFED00FF>So he took a nap for a couple hours.</font>
<font color=#FFED00FF>so he took a nap for a couple hours.</font>
<font color=#FFED00FF>What happened here? </font>
<font color=#FFED00FF>What happened here?</font>
<font color=#FFED00FF>It's not what happened, it's happening, the next big thing</font>
<font color=#FFED00FF>Not happened. Happening. The next big thing.</font>
<font color=#FFF700FF>Wardo.</font>
<font color=#FFFE00FF>hey man.</font>
<font color=#FFF800FF>Back to work</font>
<font color=#FFF800FF>Back to work.</font>
Engineers can work overtime, stay in the company and write programs without sleep
Silicon Valley companies will provide a 24-hour buffet, you can eat at any time
so you can work as long as you want
will not be interrupted by three meals
Silicon Valley's start-up environment makes entrepreneurs willing to dedicate their time
Union's 40-hour limit becomes 'outdated'
It seems that working overtime is a symbol of "success in entrepreneurship"
This work ethic slowly swept across America after the 1980s
Another source is the consulting industry and the banking industry
Many Ivy League students aspire to work at McKinsey after graduation
McKinsey is known as the Goldman Sachs of the consulting world
They preach a standard by which good employees are judged
Just to see if he's ready to commit
sacrifice for the cause
The more you can dedicate your personal life to the company, the better employee you are
It's okay to be overworked
After the employees who couldn't stay at McKinsey left
Hired by another company as a consultant
Bringing McKinsey's burnout culture across America
Wall Street Banking Promotes This Overworked Culture
Because those who can work on Wall Street
Many are Ivy League graduates who have been No. 1 since childhood
These people have the desire to be the first
So after entering Wall Street
start out who can stay in the bank longer
Treat overtime as a badge of honor
You see how much I can dedicate to the company
Since the 1990s
many businesses like to hire investment bankers
Come to the leadership of the company
It also turns the overwork culture in the banking industry into the norm in various industries
if you look closely you will find
The normalization of burnout also appears in Taiwanese coffee ads
early coffee ads
They are all conveying a good life attitude
But nearly 20 years of coffee advertising
But it has changed from a taste of life to a symbol of hard work
These ads are all spreading a message
Overtime work is the norm in the workplace
you don't need to question these things
what you need is a cup of coffee to pick you up
Continue to meet the challenges of work
Capitalism Doesn't Change Flawed Workplaces
Instead, it sells labor more goods to strengthen capitalism
When We Can't Change the Overworked, Overtime Culture
Lying flat becomes the easiest form of resistance
let's think about it
what are you doing when you lie flat
Many people's lying down refers to swiping their mobile phones, Facebook, and watching Netflix at home
These things are all technologies that people of our parents' generation could not enjoy
But millennials are more thoroughly integrated with their technological lives
so they never get bored
You don't need to go out to meet people, you can also make friends at home
Watch Netflix at home without going out to watch movies
Coupled with the epidemic, many companies have switched to working from home
It is more suitable for people to lie flat and play waste
But the author points out
this break in the millennium
It's not really lying flat
Because even downtime is invaded by capitalism
The president of Netflix said: Our company's biggest competitor is "sleep"
as long as you're awake
can turn you into a potential Netflix customer
Or when you see other people's bragging posts on Facebook, IG
will intensify one's sense of relative deprivation
Do you feel like you're not trying hard enough?
I want to make more money so I can hang out like friends and check in everywhere
This is the "attention economy" of contemporary capitalism
Everyone's attention span is limited
capitalism can take advantage of when you're lying flat
Use social networks and streaming platforms to pretend to be leisure and entertainment
It's actually grabbing your attention
Let you continue to engage in commercial behavior
Historian Benjamin Hunnicutt points out
The concept of leisure originally originated from European aristocrats
Leisure is to prove that you are rich and don't have to work
Can do things that are not helpful for work
And civilians can only rest during festivals
like going to church on sunday
or to celebrate a special holiday
It wasn't until after the Industrial Revolution that there was a statutory two-day weekend
In 1858 California Justice Stephen Johnson Field said
"One day off in seven is the rule, and backed by empirical science"
By the beginning of the 20th century
Capitalism is getting more efficient
Continuously increasing productivity
Unions push for reduced hours
Let workers suddenly have a lot of leisure time
At this time, the laborers don't know what to do
So new entertainment began to appear in the city
Dance halls, cinemas, parks, and entertainment venues all began to appear in the early 20th century
It all started in the early 20th century
Thousands of parks in the United States today were created during this period
But when laborers have more time for leisure and entertainment
Entertainment venues must be open.
then someone has to work
So movie theaters, amusement parks, convenience stores, mass transit, postman delivery
must be open on holidays
to provide entertainment for others
Before the 20th century, when workers had free time, they stayed at home or went to church
After the 20th century, the rise of leisure and entertainment
Workers just started hanging out in their free time
And in the 21st century
Workers can stay at home and watch YouTube and Netflix
But the audience can lie down and watch the film, which means that someone has to produce the film
Youtuber can't lie flat
Only then can there be a video for you to watch
So strictly speaking, if you lie flat and just watch movies at home and scroll on your phone
You're actually still relying on other people's labor.
So in 2019
Stanford scholar Jenny Odell published a book "How to "Do Nothing""
is to teach you how to really lie flat
You're ignoring everything that capitalism thinks is valuable
Do not pursue perfection, do not pursue output
Resistance to the Attention Economy
When lying flat, if you are still swiping your phone, watching dramas
You are still being robbed of attention by capitalism
In today's video we start from a historical perspective
Explains how the previous generation lived in the healthiest period of capitalism
so don't understand the plight of young people today
when capitalism starts to deteriorate
Parents began to ask for the education of the millennial generation, to be admitted to a good university
Let young people grow up in a high-pressure environment from an early age
After the results come out of society
Kidnapped by the slogan "Do what you love" and forced to accept low wages
Overwork is also normalized
Young people are being asked to work overtime to meet the challenges of work
Finally even when lying flat
may be taken advantage of by the attention economy of capitalism
These are the general circumstances that the previous generation did not have to face
So if the environment becomes so bad
Then why try harder
lying down is justice
