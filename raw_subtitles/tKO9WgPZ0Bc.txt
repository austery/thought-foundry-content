On January 10,
Paris Hilton shared a video of her house
destroyed in the LA fire.
Walking through the ruins,
heartbroken, she said
what breaks her heart even more
is knowing that this isn't just her story.
Because so many people
have lost everything.
And its not just walls and roofs
that the fire demolished.
It's the memories and the stories
that made those houses homes.
Over one million people liked her post,
showing sympathy and support
not only for her loss,
but for the very idea behind it.
Yet there's something
that most of us don't realize,
which is that every minute,
somewhere in Europe,
a house is demolished.
Every minute.
And it's not by wind, floods or fire,
but by human hands.
And honestly, this
is something I don't get
because it's not only the walls
and the roofs that we demolish,
it's the memories, the communities
and the sense of belonging
that we demolish, too,
and all of it at the cost
of the people and the planet.
So the question is,
why do we even demolish buildings?
As an architect who works on renovation,
I can tell you it's not
because these buildings are broken,
and it's not because
they cannot be renovated or fixed.
It's also not because
we want to save energy
or build better buildings
for those who currently live there.
In one word, profit.
Today, real estate is the most
valuable asset in the world.
So a majority of the global money
flows into the buying
and selling of property.
And I ask you what promises most profit?
New buildings.
Central apartments and trophy offices.
In the logic of money,
the old can never beat the new.
And this fuels a constant cycle
of demolition for new construction.
Because in the logic
of real estate speculators,
every building is up for demolition.
And this is something
you have to understand.
No, really, every house in which you live
that promises more profit
is up for demolition.
Why?
Because to speculators,
your house is a commodity.
It's a good.
And just like an old toaster,
you don't fix it, you replace it.
So why is demolition so profitable?
Well, essentially,
it's a question of values.
So in our current system,
the value of a building
is measured only by its price.
So in our real estate system,
value and price are the same.
So if I ask you,
what is the value of a house?
What is the value of this building?
What would be the answer?
Well, in a world in which value
and price are the same,
the answer shrinks
to a few economic factors.
It’s very simple,
it’s square meters and land,
location and market potential.
So this is the base
how real estate speculators calculate.
It's the base for the strategy.
So they would buy a land,
they pay the price for the building,
they clear the land,
which means they demolish the building.
They build anew,
so they add the construction costs,
and they divide it by the square meters.
Essentially, this is what
real estate speculation is about:
how much profit you can extract
from an existing building
and how much money you can make
once the old building is gone
and the new one is built.
It's a shockingly cold calculation
that turns the profit of tomorrow
into a wrecking ball today.
And it's based on a spreadsheet
that only counts money,
and it never asks what a building holds
and who lives there.
But value and price
are actually not the same.
There is a difference.
So the question shouldn’t only be:
What is the value of a house?
But the question should also be:
What is the price to your home?
Now what is the price
of the memories and the stories?
So which price do we give to family bonds,
to birthday celebrations,
to also the fights with our partners
and these moments of forgiveness?
And what price tag
do we also put on community,
on the neighborhoods that raise us,
on the familiar faces in the hallway,
on friendship?
Or on a larger scale,
on the freedom of the next
generation to live.
And these are the hidden
costs of demolition
that no one speaks about.
The hidden costs that you will never find
in a budget or in a spreadsheet.
All of it happening in an era
of severe housing crisis,
where we all agree,
where millions are struggling
to find an affordable home,
where young people cannot move out
of their parents' apartments,
where working people are struggling
to keep a roof over their head,
and where even the middle class
cannot afford property any longer.
And beyond these struggles,
homelessness is rising
in almost every country.
But it's not only the people who suffer.
The planet suffers, too,
because the building sector
is the biggest CO2 emitter on Earth,
yet no one speaks about it.
38 percent come
from the building industry,
compared to roughly
three percent for flying,
a number that we discuss
a lot, for instance.
But it's not only the biggest CO2 emitter,
it's also Europe's biggest waste producer.
36 percent of all the waste
comes from the construction industry.
And again, to put it in context,
compared to only eight percent
from private households.
So all the energy it takes
to demolish a building
and all the energy it takes
to rebuild a building
is only unleashed because the real values,
the social and the ecological values,
are not accounted in our system.
So we are tearing down buildings
and ironically, heating up both the planet
and the housing market.
So architects are part
of this value chain.
Architects are part of it,
of real estate speculation,
of demolition for new construction.
But as a citizen,
I'm suffering its consequences
of rising temperatures and rising rents.
So the question is:
How can the whole value chain evolve?
How can we evolve the value chain
by looking differently
at what we already have?
And that's getting really interesting
because what do we have around us?
Actually,
Europe is already built.
And that's really the good news.
Europe is built.
Why?
Because after the Second World War,
we introduced policies
that made rebuilding fast, cheap and easy.
And this system was basically based
on three key pillars.
Emergency policies,
industrial methods and public money.
And all of it aimed at new construction.
And even if we don't notice it day-to-day,
this system still writes the rulebooks.
It trains us today to still see the risk
instead of seeing the potential.
It still trains us to assume
that the new is always
better than the old.
And it's at the core of our legal system,
which makes it not only
less profitable for the market,
but also much, much harder
to renovate and transform,
Because all of it,
tax incentives to subsidies,
building codes to regulation
and risk insurances to credits,
favor starting anew.
The question is: What happens
if we look at things differently?
So now that we know it's rooted
in this legal system,
the market builds its strategy on,
and we know about the consequences,
it’s the moment where we can say:
How do we shift it?
And I think there it's important
to understand that we, humans,
invented that system,
so we have to make it work for us
instead of us working for the system.
And this is what French architects
Lacaton and Vassal do.
And I want to present you
one of their works today.
They look differently
at what is already there.
To them, every building is heritage.
Not because of its architectural style,
and not because once
a famous person lived in there,
but because they recognize the social
and ecological value in the building.
Lacaton Vassal, they never demolish.
They never demolish a building.
They add, they build on,
they renovate, they transform.
And by doing so,
they acknowledge all the energy
stored in the walls and the roofs,
from the thoughts to the labor
to the legacy and even the CO2.
And I want to show you
one of their projects,
which proves that it's a real alternative,
so that renovation and transformation
are a real alternative.
And we are back at the house
that I showed before,
which is a social housing in France,
the Grand Parc in Bordeaux,
530 apartments that Lacaton Vassal,
together with Druot
and Hutin Architects, transformed.
How?
All the residents stayed in the house
while the building was renovated.
They worked with prefabricated elements
that were craned in.
These elements arrived
and were stacked in front
of the existing building like a shelf,
almost like a bookshelf
that stands in front of the old.
What they did in the second step
is they opened up the old facade,
they replaced the tiny old windows
with big sliding doors,
opening the interior
to these new winter gardens,
flooding the space with light and air,
but also creating a generosity.
It's a social gesture, also.
You create generosity
for those who didn't have it before,
and amazing views.
And the numbers behind it
are really stunning.
Half a day to place
the prefabricated element.
Two days to cut open the old facade.
Two days to plug in the new facade
and one week to renovate the interior.
So it takes two weeks
to improve everybody's life.
To cut down the heating bills
and to boost local businesses
working on renovation.
And all of it at a third of the costs
of a standard new apartment.
So 55,000 euros for the renovation
of one apartment,
compared to 165,000 for new construction.
And the new apartment,
a standard new apartment,
would never have the winter gardens,
and it would never have the generosity
that they can provide in their work.
Which is a proof
that the most sustainable house
is the one already built.
And I want to show you the after image,
and that's also the moment
where I invite everybody
to imagine that this could
happen all over Europe.
This could happen all around the world,
because it is a real systemic alternative
that actually could function anywhere.
So now some of you might think,
"Well, that's a nice story,
but it won't work for my house
because I live in a single-family home,
because I own an old apartment
in a block, in a city block."
And this might be true.
This might not be your way.
But I can guarantee you, as an architect,
that there's almost for every building,
a way to be renovated and transformed.
So this can be your story.
But, and here is a but,
only if we manage
to change the legal system
that keeps the old value system in place.
We have to understand that the real
innovation and real evolution
is finding and recognizing
the value in the existing.
Because the demolition of buildings
is just as outdated as food waste,
animal testing or single-use plastics.
All things that we,
as a society, already agree on
and have an understanding for.
And this is why we say
we have to create a new system.
We have to create a common path
and focus on one collective goal,
which is to house Europe in the existing.
This is why we started an initiative,
a European Citizens Initiative,
which is a pan-European project
which has a clear mission.
Renovate, don't speculate.
Our movement aims to become
the largest architectural initiative
advocating for new laws to make renovation
and transformation the new norm --
a social, ecological but also
economic alternative
to demolition and new construction,
and all with the support
of one million citizens across the EU.
And one million is not only the number
of supporters we need,
it's also the number of likes
Paris Hilton got for her post.
So I ask everyone,
if that many people can show support
for one home lost in fire,
imagine the impact
that we can make together
for the millions of homes
that are up for demolition right now.
Thank you.
(Applause)
