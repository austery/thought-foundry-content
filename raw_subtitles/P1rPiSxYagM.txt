I've been meeting a lot of people of late
who ask me this question:
“When will Africa catch up
to the AI revolution?”
And I look at them with a lot of humility,
and I say to them,
"You're asking the wrong question."
And of course, a lot of them
look at me with surprise.
I say, here is the right question:
“When will the world catch up
to what Africa is doing with AI?”
But before I dive into AI,
you've heard a lot about AI,
let me take you on a geography lesson.
(Laughter)
Africa is big.
Just breathe in.
Take it in.
Find your country inside Africa.
It's 54 countries,
1.6 billion people,
3,000 languages, not counting dialects.
And Africa is young.
I'm one of the older ones.
And I consider myself young.
(Laughter)
Sixty percent of the world's youth
is going to be African by the year 2050.
These are digital natives,
incredible digital skills.
But it wasn't always like this.
Thirty years ago,
75 percent of Africans
had never had a phone ring.
There were five million
telephone lines in Africa.
There were more telephone lines
in New York City
than the whole of sub-Saharan Africa.
But that was 30 years ago.
In 30 years, here's what has happened.
We now have a billion
mobile phone connections.
We now have 1.1 billion
mobile money accounts.
That's up from only
300 million 10 years ago.
It's driving financial inclusion
at an unprecedented scale.
Today, if I needed to pay my barber,
the food vendor on the side of the road,
my utility bill,
my mechanic,
it's easy, it's accessible,
it's convenient, and it's cheap.
I use my mobile money account,
whether it's EcoCash or M-Pesa,
it's one of those two.
But Africa's demographic dividend
is also one of its biggest challenges.
I know,
a lot of people think of Africa
and they think of poverty
and disease and wars,
but this is not our biggest problem.
Our biggest challenge
is youth unemployment.
And I think it's one challenge
that AI is uniquely placed to solve.
And Africa has been able
to embrace technology
at an unprecedented scale.
So now that we've been through geography,
let me take you into the future.
Please meet Yemurai.
Yemurai is 24.
She’s a high school graduate.
Born in Zimbabwe
and raised in Zimbabwe, like me.
Like millions of her peers,
she's tech savvy.
She can type faster than any of you.
She knows all the shortcuts on WhatsApp.
But up until now,
her future would have been bleak.
She would have been as unemployed
as any of her peers
but for the fact
that she has just graduated
from one of the AI academies
that we have on the continent.
And this is where we find her.
Early morning,
Yemurai is teaching math, using AI
to over 200 students across five schools.
These schools have got free internet.
By midday,
Yemurai has joined the local nurse
at a health clinic
that is not too far away
from where she lives.
Helping with diagnosis,
malaria, TB,
bilharzia -- that’s a disease, by the way.
And by the evening,
some of her neighbors
are coming to see Yemurai
with soil samples
and with diseased plants
that she takes photos of,
and she's able to tell them
what fertilizer, what seeds,
what's happening to their maize crop.
Yields are now up
40 percent where she lives.
But Yemurai is not a teacher.
She's not a nurse.
She's not an agronomist.
What is she?
She's what we call
an AI-amplified community entrepreneur.
She's paid for each
of these services that I described
through her mobile money accounts,
and she's earning three times more
than the peers in her local area,
and even those that are
in the urban areas.
She's solving the problem
of the shortage of teachers
that is so pervasive
across most of Africa.
This is how we're going to solve
the problem of a shortage of doctors
that is so pervasive
across most of Africa.
And in many of the rural areas of Africa,
where there's so much arable land,
there is such a shortage of agronomists.
And now Yemurai,
powered with a smartphone
and an AI assistant,
is able to solve these problems.
Now I'm looking at you
and you're asking yourselves,
how is this even possible?
I'm glad you asked.
My name is Hardy Pemhiwa,
I am the CEO of Cassava Technologies.
We are the company
that has literally connected Africa.
The map that you see
on the screen is not a plan.
It's a map that shows
110,000 kilometers of fiber
that we have built
across the African continent,
literally from Cape Town to Cairo,
from Mombasa on the east coast
to Moanda on the west coast.
We are connecting more
than 300 towns and cities
across Africa with fiber broadband,
bringing internet to more
than 500 million people
across the continent.
And we have now added a platform
of interconnected data centers
that are AI-ready.
And this is where AI
meets the infrastructure
that Cassava has been building.
Our plan now is to build
Africa's first AI factory
using local data, algorithms,
local compute capacity
to produce local intelligence.
We're building an AI ecosystem
for those that were previously excluded,
because we understand
that without AI infrastructure,
Africa is going to fall further behind.
Our AI factory is
about bringing breakthroughs.
It's about bringing job creation.
It's about powering Yemurai's dream
of being a doctor,
an agronomist and a teacher.
Powered with mobile broadband,
mobile money,
fiber broadband and now GPUs
that we've been able to get from Nvidia,
we are bringing to life AI infrastructure
for Africa to compete
with everybody else in this AI age.
This is Africa's AI revolution.
It's not about substitution,
it's about multiplication.
We want to amplify human capacity,
and we want to eliminate impossibility
by bringing AI
to those that the world
had previously excluded.
So what is our AI factory going to do?
Already, we're powering
more than 12,000 AI developers,
more than 1,100 startups,
across Southern Africa, East Africa
West Africa and North Africa.
285 universities
are going to be using our AI factory.
And because we've already been working
with enterprises for the past 30 years,
67,000 of Africa's largest enterprises,
from banks to telcos
to state-owned enterprises,
are all embracing this vision
of an AI-powered future for the continent.
On a continent where
the median age is only 19,
this is not just an improvement
of digital infrastructure.
This is a revolution
that we are bringing to Africa.
Because the next one billion users of AI
are not going to use AI the same way
that the first one billion
have been using it.
They are coming from places
where a single AI-amplified human
must do the work of 10.
They are building AI to not
only diagnose diseases
that some of us have never heard of,
but to teach math
and physics and chemistry
in Swahili, in Ndebele,
in Zulu, in Shona, you name it.
They are building AI in order
to detect counterfeit medicines.
Africa has a big problem
with counterfeit medicines.
They are building AI to diagnose crops.
They're building AI
to amplify human possibility.
Because in Africa, constraints
have always driven innovation.
That's why pay-as-you-go came from Africa.
That's why mobile money came from Africa.
Because we didn't have
bank accounts to protect.
And that's why AI models
that are trained on African realities
are more robust, more efficient,
and more inclusive.
So I'm going to go back
to my initial question
that I've been asked by so many,
including some that I've met
during this conference.
“When will Africa catch up
to the AI revolution?”
I'm sure you agree with me
that whilst we sit here
in this conference,
talking about AI ethics,
in Africa, we are deploying AI
to serve the many and not the few.
We are optimizing AI for impact
and not for social media clicks.
(Applause)
Thirty years ago,
the "experts on Africa" said
it would take 50 years
for Africa to have the kind
of mobile telephony that we have.
And they estimated that it would require
50 billion dollars to do it.
Well, I have news for you:
70 percent of the mobile
money transactions
that are going to happen
in the world today
are going to happen on African soil.
And guess what?
Africa is ready to do it again.
We want to make AI inclusive, accessible,
relevant and affordable.
Because the future of AI
is not just going to be
written in Silicon Valley.
The future of AI
is going to be to be written
in the Silicon Savanna in Kenya.
It's going to be written
on the streets of Lagos.
It's going to be written
in thousands of villages
that some of us have never heard of.
There are millions of Yemurais out there
that are writing the future of AI,
solving problems that we didn't
even know existed,
building a future where AI
amplifies human potential
instead of replacing it.
In London, they are worrying
about whether teachers are going
to lose their jobs because of AI.
In Africa, we're embracing AI
to solve the shortage of teachers.
In New York,
they're building AI algorithms
in order to trade stocks faster.
For us, it's about AI
that can increase crop yields
and reduce mortality
amongst five-year-olds.
That's the future of AI.
So this is not just Africa's AI moment.
This is AI's Africa moment.
Are you coming?
(Applause)
