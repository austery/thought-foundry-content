What I'm about to say are my ideas, they don't 
necessarily represent those of the US government,  
the US Navy Department, the US Department of 
Defense, or the Naval War College, you got  
that clear? Complain to me if you got problems.
All right, I'm going to talk about Mao. He’s  
an incredibly consequential 
figure. For the 20th century,  
he's one of the most consequential political 
or military figures, and he's also one of the  
most important figures in Chinese history 
of any century. And he's also a terribly  
significant military-political theorist.
And this is not an endorsement of Mao. It  
is rather just an accurate description 
of his global and enduring importance. 
Think about China historically: it's represented- 
I don’t know- a third of the world's population,  
a third of the world's trade. That's a big slice 
of humanity. Moreover, Mao's theories have been  
used by many enemies of the United States to 
take over failing states from within in order  
to assert dictatorial rule. He is also probably 
the most brilliant and most famous psychopath  
in human history, and that is saying a lot.
So here we go. This presentation is based on  
the first eight volumes of Stuart Schram's 
Collected Works of Mao. What Schram did is  
he compared Mao's complete works, as published 
in the 1950s, to whatever he could find as the  
earliest version of whatever it was. Then he 
reinserted whatever had been cut in italics. 
So tonight, watch the italics. Mao didn't 
put all of his best ideas in one place;  
he scattered them all over the place.
And so what I've done for you all is  
prepared a jigsaw puzzle of all of these different 
ideas. In order to make it comprehensible to you,  
of all these random little tidbits, you have to 
have like a coat rack to hang all the hangers,  
and that's called a simple framework, and I'll 
get there, but in your own lives, when you've  
got all kinds of complicated things to transmit 
to others, you can look at what I'm doing tonight,  
and you can do it for other things as 
well. So here we go with good old Mao. 
And oh, by the way, a lot of 
those 8,000, 7,000 pages weren't  
that interesting, so in a way, you owe me.
All right, these are major military theorists,  
just to run you through them. Clausewitz 
is the West's major military theorist of  
bilateral conventional land warfare. Sun 
Tzu is Han civilization's great theorist  
of how you maintain power in a continental empire, 
multilateral world using coercion and deception. 
The two fellows on the right are 
maritime theorists. In a way,  
they're writing the missing chapters of Clausewitz 
that doesn't talk about naval warfare at all. 
The top one is Alfred Thayer Mahan, the 
Naval War College's finest. And what he's  
writing about are the prerequisites for and 
strategic possibilities for maritime power. 
And the Briton underneath him there, Sir Julian 
Corbett, is writing about how a maritime power,  
i.e. Britain, can defeat a continental 
power, i.e. Germany or France. But all of  
them are writing about warfare between 
states, and Mao is a different event. 
Mao has to do with triangle building. The term 
"triangle building" comes from Clausewitz.  
Clausewitz has this nice little passage here where 
he's talking about these abstractions: passion,  
creativity, and rationality as being mainly 
but not exclusively associated respectively  
with the people, military, and government.
A state has full-up military and civil  
institutions that have some connection to 
their people, but an insurgent is going to  
be building these things from the ground up. 
So that's what Mao is doing, is he's actually  
taking over the host from within by building a 
shadow government and eventually taking power. 
Many of the decolonizing world after World 
War II were really sick of the West. They'd  
been colonized, didn't want to hear anything 
about them. But it seemed as if the Soviets  
or the Chinese perhaps offered a better 
model, the Communists, and many thought  
that the Chinese, Mao, offered the better model.
Why? Because the decolonizing parts of the world  
were also agricultural and underdeveloped, unlike 
Russia, which had quite a military—excuse me,  
an industrial base. They thought Mao was the 
more relevant guy. All right, here's Mao at his  
iconic moment. He's proclaiming the victory 
of the Communists in the Chinese Civil War. 
China had been a broken state basically since 
1911, when the last dynasty had fallen and the  
country had broken out into a multilateral 
civil war that he eventually wins. I’m going  
to be talking tonight about Mao’s theories from 
the 1920s and 30s when he had the time to write,  
but there’s a lot more to Mao than 
just that. He had quite a track record. 
Once he won the civil war, he imposed a 
social revolution. What's that? It's more  
than a political revolution. You're 
not just replacing the government;  
you're going to wipe out entire social classes. 
And I don't mean then, "Hey, here's your one-way  
ticket out of here" kind of way. No, no, a 
social revolution is, "Here's a mass grave,  
dig it, and then you're in it" kind of way.
So, if you look at these statistics of Chinese  
deaths in many of their wars—this 
is from much of the Maoist period,  
I think it's '45 to '75—what you'll notice, the 
figures in white, I believe, are civilian deaths,  
not military deaths. And it gets really quite 
ugly. There are more Chinese civilian deaths  
here than all deaths in World War II.
And then for those of you who think the  
Chinese are all great long-term strategists, 
you need to ponder these numbers. How is it  
possible to kill so many of your own? That's 
generally not a mark of good strategy. 
Moreover, most of them died during the Great 
Famine, which was the only nationwide famine  
in Chinese history. Why? Because it's not caused 
by the weather. It's caused by policies set in  
Beijing. During the Great Leap Forward, 
Mao put all the peasants on communes. 
That meant the party was in control of the food 
supply: i.e, who lives and who dies. You don't  
get a meal, you're very dead. In addition, he 
decentralized industry, and you can see these  
backyard furnaces pictured here. As a result 
of this, production collapses—agricultural and  
industrial. But Mao keeps exporting food. Why?
Because that's his pocket change. That is a  
major source of government income if 
he wants to be able to do anything,  
so they keep exporting food. As a result, 40 
million Chinese starved to death, primarily in  
rural areas, and disproportionately peasant 
girls, the least valued members of society. 
The statistic of 40 million deaths comes from 
this book by Yang Jisheng, who has written the  
definitive work. The English translation is 
but one volume; the Chinese original is three.  
Yang worked as a journalist for many years, 
which gave him access to provincial archives,  
where he surreptitiously investigated the 
statistics of people who were starving to death,  
including his father, for whom he wrote 
this book to serve as an eternal tombstone. 
So, on the one hand, Mao is the military genius 
who puts Humpty Dumpty back together again when  
nobody else could, and they tried for the previous 
40 years. On the other hand, he is the psychopath  
incapable of running an economy in peacetime.
Yet many Chinese revere him as a national hero.  
Why? Because in their minds, certainly of 
the Han, the preponderant group in China,  
one of the key things that their country 
should and must be is a great power. And Mao,  
by reunifying China under the banner of communism 
and then fighting the coalition of all the major  
capitalist powers to a stalemate in the 
Korean War, or in their mind a victory,  
that constitutes ending what they consider the 
era of humiliations that started in the mid-19th  
century and ended with the Communist Revolution.
So he's a hero at home. All right,  
to understand Mao's theories, I need to put 
it in the context of the wars that he fought. 
So in 1911, Qing Dynasty collapses. The 
country shatters into a multilateral warfare  
among warlords, these provincial leaders. On 
this map, you can see the different colors and  
shadings; those are different warlord areas.
But the Nationalist Party and the Communist  
Party form a united front in 1923 in order to 
eliminate these warlords. And so Chiang Kai-shek,  
who is the head of the Nationalist 
Party, a generalissimo, not just a  
general, has a nice artwork on his portrait.
He is the man who's leading the northern  
expedition to fight off all the warlords. Except 
he stops midway near his power base in Shanghai,  
and he turns on the communists, massacres 
them in droves. This is the White Terror. 
Why? Because he thinks that while 
he's away fighting, they're trying  
to take over his government while he's away. 
He's correct. So he keeps on moving there. 
There's a nominal unification of China 
under Nationalist rule when this takes  
place. In addition, once he's done with that, 
then he wants to eliminate the Communists for  
good. And so he runs a series of five 
encirclement campaigns around their base  
areas that are scattered in South China.
The primary base area- a base area is also  
called a Soviet, is the Jiangxi Soviet. And on 
the fifth encirclement campaign, Chiang Kai Shek  
is finally successful. He sends them off on the 
long march up to, way up north in desolate Yenan. 
Long march is a real misnomer. It's the Long 
Rout. The Communists lose 95% of their forces. 
I believe in English “decimate” means to 
lose 10%. Losing 95%, I think you need a  
whole new verb for what's happened to you. 
But Chiang Kai Shek doesn't wipe them out,  
because he's suffering from divided attentions.
When the West did the original- well it was both  
the United States and Europe, the United States 
does its original America first thing with a  
Hawley-Smoot tariff, putting tariffs up to 
historic highs. And then everybody, of course,  
retaliates. And now everybody's got high tariffs.
Well, here's trade dependent Japan, that's always  
cooperated with everybody and suddenly they're 
toast. And so their solution is autarky and they  
need an empire large enough to be autarchic. And 
so then that's when they invade Manchuria in 1931. 
So Chiang Kai Shek has all of a sudden 
lost this area from China that's greater  
than Germany and France combined. It's a mess. 
And so he has to, he's trying to balance what  
to do about Japanese versus Communists.
The Japanese don't quit with Manchuria.  
They stabilize the place, they make 
massive infrastructure developments,  
they transform it into the most developed 
part of Asia outside of the home islands,  
but they keep on going. And it gets so bad 
that the Communists and the Nationalists  
form a second united front because they're 
facing this lethal threat called Japan. 
And they organized that in December 1936 in what's 
known as the Xi'an Incident. And the Japanese  
react viscerally because they look at it, and 
the Nationalists have gone over to the dark side  
because they've joined up with the Communists. 
And this is when the Japanese escalate in 1937,  
go down the Chinese coast up the Yangtze River.
Uh, and well, but then they wind up stalemating.  
Once they get beyond the Chinese railway 
system, which isn't that great in this period,  
the Japanese can't stabilize the place 
and the Soviets start adding more aid,  
and we add more aid. It's a mess.
So the Japanese decide they're going to  
cut Western aid to the Chinese. And that's 
where Pearl Harbor comes in. That's what the  
attack of Pearl Harbor is all about, is telling 
Americans to stay out of Asia, which of course,  
you know, we did just the opposite.
And then the Nazis interpret their alliance  
with the Japanese broadly to declare war on the 
United States. So when that happens, you have a  
regional war that had already been going on over 
Poland in Europe and this other war that had been  
going on since `31 in Asia, they unify into 
a global World War. Mao understood that he  
was dealing with three layers of warfare, nested 
wars, that he was fighting a civil war against the  
Nationalists within a regional war against Japan.
And then after Pearl Harbor, there's going to be  
a global war that will eventually morph into a 
global Cold War. Most of his writings are written  
before Pearl Harbor. So he's going to focus on 
the first two layers of what's going on here. 
So after the World War II is over, Mao goes after 
the Nationalists full bore, and the Japanese have  
already very much weakened the Nationalists and 
Mao wins the civil war. Okay, these are the wars. 
Now, I promised you a simple framework. Here's 
the simple framework. Simple framework should  
have three to five things because that's all 
about any of us could really handle on short  
notice. And so I got four here.
And I'm going to use Clausewitz's  
definition of great leadership to analyze 
Mao. According to Clausewitz, in a general,  
two qualities are indispensable. First 
is an intellect that even in the darkest  
hour – and Mao had many of those – retains some 
glimmering of inner light, which leads to truth. 
And second, the courage to follow that faint 
light wherever it may lead. The first of these  
qualities is described by the French term, coup 
d'oeil. Coup is a glance, d'oeil is an eye,  
taking in a situation with a glance of 
an eye. And the second is determination. 
Well, Mao had these things in numerous areas. 
I'm going to first discuss Mao the propagandist,  
that's how he starts out. And then I've got 
what I say here is Mao the social scientist. 
But what he was really good is data analysis, 
data collection and analysis. He truly understood  
the countryside because he collected all 
sorts of data about it and analyzed it.  
And then I will go on to Mao, the operational 
military leader, winning and fighting battles. 
And then at the end, I'll talk about Mao 
the grand strategist, integrating all  
elements of national power. So that's my game 
plan. That's the simple framework. And away we go. 
All right. Mao began his public service 
career as a propagandist. And if you  
look at his early biography, he's born in 
1893 to a prosperous but not particularly  
well-educated father who tilled his own land.
Mao hated his father and he hated farming,  
so he left as soon as possible. After 
the 1911 revolution for a little while  
he worked as a soldier, didn't like that.
He joined and then dropped out of a series  
of vocational schools. He tried being 
a, what was it? A merchant, a lawyer,  
I'm missing something else, a soap maker. Imagine 
Mao, three stages of personal hygiene, whatever. 
It was not to be. But he eventually gets an Ed 
degree, so he can go off and be a primary school  
principal. Okay, imagine setting your child 
off to the psychopath doing show and tell. 
And then he joins the Communist Party. 
And it's during the First United Front  
so he also joins the Nationalist Party. And he 
has very important positions. If you look at,  
he's in the National Party, he's at their central 
headquarters, and he's the minute taker. So he's  
the fly on the wall listening to everything.
And then he's a stand in for the head of the  
propaganda department, which is probably 
where he learned a great deal about the  
importance of propaganda. And here's what 
he says early on, “the Communist Party can  
overthrow the enemy only by holding propaganda 
pamphlets in one hand and bullets in the other”. 
And if you look at the original organization 
chart of the shadow Communist government,  
you'll see there are only what, six departments 
there? One of them is a propaganda department. If  
you have no power, words are, is, your initial 
way into gaining power. I'm now going to use  
a framework from my wonderful colleagues, 
Mark Genest and Andrea Dew, this is theirs,  
about analyzing strategic communication 
in terms of messenger, message and medium.  
And I'll go through each three, all three.
What you see here is a propaganda poster.  
It's a woodblock print. That's the 
medium. And it's a very easy way to  
reproduce pictures back in the day.
The message is about a model laborer,  
this “always emulate Wu Man Yo”, lucky us. And 
to do all the nice things he does with whatever  
is going on there. So that's what that is.
Now, messengers were the delivery system,  
the broadcasting system for the Communist 
Party. So you've got the Communist Party,  
but you've got to reach an audience. And 
that's what these messengers are doing. 
And so they go into local areas and they identify 
local grievances for attention by the Communist  
Party, which when it fixes them or fixes somebody, 
that will generate loyalties and allegiance. So  
these propaganda personnel would be identifying 
local bullies to come in and deal with them,  
organize mass rallies. During battles they're 
going to double as medics, after battles,  
they're going to propagandize POWs, between 
battles, they are helping on troop morale.  
But what they're really doing is reporting back 
to Communist Central exactly what's going on. 
And civil and military messengers differ. For 
civil messengers, they would be activists,  
maybe in the local government, labor unions, 
peasant organizations, women organizations,  
any number of these things. And it's 
there, it's your broadcasting system  
to reach a population and mobilize it.
Military messengers are a little different.  
Every single military unit had about a 20-member 
propaganda team. That's a lot of people. According  
to Mao, the propaganda work of the Red Army 
is therefore first-priority work of the Red  
Army. This is very different from soldiering 
in the West. This is not how it would work. 
Also, Mao had his international broadcasting 
system. These would be foreign journalists. While  
Mao was holding court up in Yenan, he invited many 
of these journalists up there. Edgar Snow was by  
far the most famous. Why? Because he was the 
first one in and then he was that last one out.  
He had really long interviews with Mao, and when 
he was a young man he never asked, "Why does this  
A-list political leader spending so much time with 
me?" That never occurred to Edgar. But it's hours. 
And he was a very fine writer, Edgar Snow. 
What Edgar Snow writes, Red Star Over China,  
you can probably go to Barnes and Noble and pick 
up a copy there. It's been in print ever since,  
and it's the original footnote in Chinese 
history because no one knew anything about Mao. 
And so then everybody starts citing Edgar Snow, 
and then we cite everybody and everybody and  
everybody. But actually, it only goes back 
to Edgar Snow. So, Mao got his word out. 
Mao thought, "You want to keep the message 
simple. You want to make it epigrammatic so  
that people can understand it rapidly." In 
his day, this meant having matching slogans,  
the equivalent of newspaper headlines, to 
provide a lens for people to understand events,  
rather like tweets in our own day. So, when the 
White Terror occurred, when Chiang Kai-shek is  
turning on the Communists in the first United 
Front, the slogan was, "Arm the peasants." 
And then, when the Japanese invaded Manchuria in 
1931, the new slogan is, "Down with imperialism  
and the Nationalist Party too," because you want 
to smear your enemy in the civil war while you're  
at it there. But there are a whole series of these 
slogans. And here, Mao is one of the most popular  
poets in China, certainly, of the 20th century.
He could write really simple couplets. If  
you look here, I think it's a total of eight 
characters so that someone who's semiliterate  
can make their way through this poem.
On the other hand, he wrote really  
complicated things because he needed to garner 
the support of intellectuals initially before  
he'd educated enough peasants and workers 
to take over. Intellectuals prize poetry,  
and they also prize what's called grass writing, 
which is that unintelligible Chinese stuff that’s  
under there. But if Mao set these poems to tunes 
that everybody knew, people could sing them on the  
Long March and elsewhere and learn them that way.
So, he's an incredibly accomplished man. He also  
understood you have to manage the message, 
and the way he did that is through political  
mobilization. Part of that is you've got to 
tell people what the policy objective is,  
which for him was abolishing imperialism, 
feudalism, and the landlord class, and then  
presenting a strategy for how to get there.
And here are the media that he used: not only  
the written and spoken word but also the dramatic 
arts in order to get the message out. He also used  
an institutional medium of education. And here is 
Mao, the primary school teacher, in his element. 
Most of the people in his armies were illiterate, 
but Mao knew all about how to reach them. There  
are a lot of political commissars. What are they?
Political and military commissars come in a  
pair. Military commissar is the military 
professional who actually knows about the  
fighting. The political commissar is the one 
with the direct line to the secret police who  
will cap the military commissar if 
there are any problems whatsoever. 
So, Mao's got an elaborate network to 
get the message out, offering all kinds  
of social services to people, not only 
medical but also education for peasant  
children. And he also educated their parents. 
This is for the first time in Chinese history. 
He did it during the winter slack season. Now, the 
Nationalists had also tried to improve education,  
but once the Japanese invaded full bore, they had 
to drop it because the Nationalist conventional  
armies are the ones that are fighting 
off the Japanese conventional armies.  
The Communists are a guerilla movement, 
and they're operating behind enemy lines. 
So, as the Nationalists are dragooning people 
into their armies, the Communists are busy  
offering social services, and I'll get to land 
reform. And so for the peasants, before too long,  
it becomes a no-brainer whom they're going to 
support. Mao also emphasized professional military  
education because he needs to turn peasants to 
cadres, to guerillas, to conventional soldiers. 
And there's got to be an educational pipeline 
to do this. And if you look at this Northwest  
Counter-Japan Red Army University, 
of the first original departments,  
political work is one of them. This is not 
professional military education the way it's  
done in the West, it's a separate thing.
Okay, part one over: Mao the propagandist,  
I've covered that. Now I'm going to 
go about Mao the social scientist. 
And here, he says, "The peasant problem is the 
central problem of the national revolution. If  
the peasants do not rise up and join and support 
the national revolution, the national revolution  
cannot succeed." And if you look at his, further 
along in his biography, while the first United  
Front was still operative, he's heading the 
Nationalist Party's Peasant Institute in  
Guangzhou and also their Central Commission on the 
Peasant Movement, learning a great deal about it. 
But once the White Terror hits, he needs to 
get out of Dodge fast, or they'll kill him.  
And that's where he flees to Jiangxi Province, to 
the Jiangxi Soviet, where he is going to become  
the political commissar of the 4th Army. He's also 
going to be in charge of land reform as he figures  
out how to calibrate that to make it work.
All right, for Mao, he's doing data-driven  
survey after data-driven survey, does a whole 
series of them between 1926 and 1933. And he's  
trying to figure who owns what, who works 
for whom, who tills where, and inventories  
down to the last pitchfork and last chicken, as 
he's trying to establish what is really going on  
on the countryside, and he does. What he concludes 
is that 6% of the rural population owns 80% of the  
land, and 80% of the population owns only 20% 
and his solution is going to be revolution. 
And he goes further into the statistics 
and he identifies 70% as poor peasants,  
20% who are like his father—they till their 
own land, they're middle peasants—and then  
there are the exploitative 10% who don't 
get their hands dirty with anything. And  
what Mao is trying to figure out is how you can 
incentivize 80% of those people into actively  
taking part in the revolution. This is the key.
And what he wants to do is take the bottom of  
the social pyramid and mobilize it to crush 
the top of the pyramid. The way he's going  
to do this is by determining class status through 
a land investigation movement, which he says is  
a violent and ruthless thing. We're going to 
talk about class, approval of class status,  
confiscation of land, and redistribution of 
land, in order to invert the social pyramid. 
He's got a real plan for doing it. He argues 
that land reform is just essential for peasant  
allegiance. This is how you're going to get 
it, to draw these hundreds of millions into  
supporting the communists. But you got to do it 
sequentially: you’ve got to propagandize first,  
and then you’re going to distribute land later. 
A little bit later. He had a very bureaucratic  
way of redistributing land, the approval of 
class status, he said, it’s a life-and-death  
decision for the person in question.
It starts out with a vote at the local level,  
and then it goes through many layers of party 
approval before being sent back to the local  
level to announce who's going to get the land 
and who's going to take a bullet. And then  
Mao leverages the enthusiasm of this movement 
for the people who are going to get the land,  
the other people, not so much. He's going 
to leverage this enthusiasm to get people  
to join the party and also to join the army.
Mao is planning to collectivize all land.  
That's what the Communists are going to do. 
But he says, "Look, the system of landlords and  
tenants cannot be completely destroyed yet."
Because he needs the peasants to join him,  
and the peasants desperately want land. 
So, Mao gives it to them, and he gets  
a great deal of support for doing this. But 
he also keeps the rich peasants around, too. 
This is a deleted portion in the collected 
works: “because rich peasant production is  
indispensable”. Until he wins the civil 
war and can then turn the guns on them.  
And he's also got a duplicitous program for the 
middle peasants. It's a big bait and switch. 
It looks like you're going to get -- 
see, you got the land? Well, now you do,  
and now you don't, because at the end, 
they're all going to lose their land. 
In order to reform, to get the land, Mao is 
talking about a red terror to get it. And  
while he was still with the Nationalists, he 
wrote a report on the peasant movement in Hunan,  
where he's talking about taking all the land from 
the landlord class and shooting them. And that  
won't cut it with the Nationalist army because 
their officers are landlords. So, as part of his  
program, it's not just land reform and educating 
people, warm and cuddly. It's also coercion. 
Okay, that's Mao the social 
scientist. Enough of him. Now,  
we're going to do Mao the military leader.
You've probably heard this chestnut from Mao:  
"Political power grows out of the barrel 
of a gun." Mao spent his- it’s still part  
of his early career- being right but being 
a minority view. That he had certain views  
about military operations that were not shared 
by Communist Central. And Mao kept following  
that dim light wherever it may lead, and events 
eventually vindicated him. He survived a variety  
of encirclement campaigns, but then he had 
some troubles. And here are his critics. 
Li Lisan was a labor organizer, he was the 
de facto head of the Communist Party from  
1928 to 1930. And after the white 
terror on the Northern Expedition,  
Moscow had told its communist buddies in China 
that the next thing to do was to take the cities. 
And so Li Lisan tries to, with 
the Nanchang uprising in 1927.  
Total disaster. And he tries it again in 1930 
with the Changsha uprising, another disaster. 
That got him into exile in Russia and according 
to Mao, Comrade Li Lisan did not understand  
the protracted nature of the Chinese Civil 
War. Li Lisan is trying to fight a decisive,  
war-winning battle far too early. You try 
to do that, and you can get yourself ruined. 
Here's another critic, Xiang Ying. Mao is in the 
Jiangxi Soviet, and he thinks a smart strategy is  
to lure the enemy into your own terrain, which 
is favorable to you, let them get exhausted,  
then you spring the trap and you annihilate them.
Communist Central in Shanghai thought this was  
nuts, that you shouldn't be ceding territory 
at all. So Mao, for the longest time, he’s off  
in Jiangxi, they were off in Shanghai, they were 
a long way apart, and so Communist Central can’t  
do anything about it- Mao does his own thing.
So the communist Central sent Xiang Ying to  
Jiangxi Soviet to fire Mao personally, and you can 
imagine how this works for his later career- not  
well. He fires Mao and this is where his strategy 
winds up producing the Long March, the Long  
Retreat, in which they lose 95% of their people by 
trying to defend territory, so people began to get  
it, that Mao may have known what he was doing.
Then, on the Long Retreat, Mao chose as his  
terminal point of retreat, like 
where you’re going to wind up,  
as up in Yenon, way up north, deep in Muslim 
and Mongol lands, but near the Soviet border. 
Mao thought that was essential because they're 
the big benefactor. Whereas this gentleman,  
Zhang Guotao, who was the military commissar 
of the Fourth Army, thought, "Nonsense, we're  
Han Chinese, we want to be in Han lands." So he 
wanted to go into western Sichuan, which he did. 
And he suffered a series of defeats over 1935, and 
as a result, he was never as important ever again,  
and eventually defected to the Nationalists. So, 
Mao had proven himself prescient and right and  
determined. He had kudoi and determination, 
and people eventually recognized that. 
All right, Mao and Clausewitz define war somewhat 
differently. Clausewitz has this famous line,  
"War is thus an act of force to compel 
our enemy to do our will." Mao says,  
"No, no, war is politics by other means. 
It is something that is used to achieve  
political ends." So far that's not incompatible.
But then here's Mao's twist: "A revolution is an  
uprising, an act of violence whereby one class 
overthrows the power of another." Clausewitz is  
not about class warfare at all. In fact, his wife 
is always trying to wine and dine the aristocrats,  
so completely different in that department.
Mao is looking at the world, and he believes the  
linchpin of the social order are landlords. He's 
going to detonate them and try to destroy them. 
He talks about the violence of all of it, 
that you're going to get the peasant masses  
to overthrow these landlords, and that 
this will require terror in rural areas,  
but this is absolutely necessary and of course 
this is what the Nationalists absolutely would  
not tolerate. Mao also understood he was 
operating in a period of nested wars,  
and that the ones that were ongoing were 
the civil war with the Nationalists and  
then the regional war with Japan. Pearl 
Harbor comes a little later. And he talked  
about defeating Japan in three stages.
He said “defeating Japan requires three  
conditions: first is progress by China”, i.e, the 
civil war, “which is the basic and primary thing;  
the second is difficulties for Japan”, i.e, the 
regional war, “and the third is international  
support”, the big friend. I'm going to talk 
about each of these three things in turn. 
So, in order to win the civil war, Mao 
believes you need base areas, these Soviets,  
where are they located? Often on the boundaries 
of provinces, in very difficult terrain,  
where provincial authority, let alone 
national authority, simply does not extend. 
Mao thought that there were certain 
prerequisites for a good base area.  
One is strategic terrain. It's got to be 
defensible so that the weaker communist  
forces can defend it against conventional 
nationalist or conventional Japanese armies.  
So that’s key, pick your terrain carefully.
Also, you need to have a strong Red Army  
presence there to make it work. You need 
numerous organized workers and peasants.  
You've got to have some local support there. 
And then you need a good party organization. 
This is Mao's idea of what you need for 
a base area. He believed that you needed  
to match your military unit, the type of 
military unit, to the territory. He said  
there are three kinds of territory: there's 
base areas, there is enemy-controlled areas,  
and then there is the interface in between, which 
is where guerilla forces are going to be roaming. 
So he was all about deploying the Red 
Army to the comparatively safe base area,  
they'll protect that. You might send guerilla 
detachments to some of the guerilla areas,  
but really only really small things would 
you ever send into enemy territory. Moreover,  
he has prerequisites to fight. There are six 
possible prerequisites; you've got to have at  
least two before you fight. The most important 
one is that people have to actively support you.  
You probably need a base area to pull this off.
He said that the last three things about enemy  
weak points, enemy exhaustion, enemy 
mistakes, those things could appear  
quite rapidly. But you better choose your 
terrain very carefully; terrain is immutable. 
He also said that if you're weak the way 
the Communists were, you had to follow a  
strategy of annihilation. What you do is you 
annihilate one small enemy unit at a time,  
and the cumulative effects will eventually change 
the balance of power. Only someone who is really  
strong can tough out an attrition strategy.
He's also about triangle building  
in these areas. So, little guerilla detachments 
go out into the interface. If it works out  
well and it looks like they can start either 
a new base area or expand an existing one,  
that's what they're going to be up to.
So, these guerilla forces are either a  
disposal force, which you could send them out 
to do risky things, and if they get wiped out,  
it doesn't endanger base area defense, or they can 
become a nucleus of a new base area. So in small  
guerilla groups, party members are toughened, 
cadres trained, the party government,  
mass organizations are consolidated. If 
they're successful, then you bring in the  
Red Army to do higher-level institution building 
and either greatly expand an existing base area,  
or you're forming a new one, is what’s going on.
Mao had two military services, we always think  
of army, navy, air force—that's 
not what it was for him. It was  
guerilla forces versus conventional forces.
And guerilla forces are operating in the  
rear of the enemy so that there's no stability or 
security. In fact, there isn't even a front line;  
it's just so amorphous. And so what guerilla 
forces are supposed to be doing is exterminating  
small enemy forces, weaken larger ones, 
attack enemy lines of communications,  
establish bases, and force the enemy to disperse, 
but they're doing all this in combination with  
conventional forces. Because here's the thing: 
you think about Mao and his guerillas, well,  
actually, here's what Mao really says: 
"Regular forces are of primary importance  
because it is they who alone are capable of 
producing the decision," like winning the war. 
“There is in guerilla warfare no such thing as a 
war-winning battle”. The relationship of the two  
is really important. Mao also thought that you 
needed to establish a fire escape if you had a  
base area, like, if it all goes south, where do 
you go? And his terminal point of retreat for  
the Long March was up in Yenan. He thought it was 
important to figure those things out in advance. 
Mao also cultivated an unprecedented group of 
allies, never before assembled in Chinese history:  
not only peasants, but women, minorities, 
youth, intellectuals, and the enemy army,  
most creatively. For cultivating the allegiance 
of peasants, it wasn't just education and land  
reform, it was also army discipline. This is where 
the three rules, six points for attention, and a  
couple of additional points were enforced through 
1949, when the Communists win the civil war.  
Why? You don't want to alienate the peasantry.
These are the people that are forming your cadres,  
your guerrillas, everything. So, maintain 
army discipline. Don't mess with it. 
Mao also took an incredibly forward-looking view 
about women. Here he is with his fourth wife,  
the actress. The other three had suffered, 
respectively, abandonment, execution by  
the nationalists, and commitment to a Soviet 
psychiatric ward. Not fates for the faint-hearted. 
But Mao calculated that women are about half 
the population. They're miserably treated,  
so they're naturals for wanting a revolution. 
They're a force that will decide the success  
or failure of the revolution.
He calculated correctly,  
and he was way ahead of his times. He also 
understood that in a guerrilla war, you're  
sending all the guys off fighting, and you've 
got to be building base areas and things. This  
is where women came in to do those activities.
As a result, he offered women the unthinkable,  
which is “men and women are absolutely 
equal. Women have the right to vote,  
be elected, and participate in the work of the 
government”. He's just way ahead of his times. 
Mao also offered minorities the previously 
unofferable, which was self-determination.  
What the minority people didn't get is that a 
promise made in a really desperate civil war,  
with a regional war overlaid, once you win 
those things and you can turn your guns on  
those trying to secede, that promise may be 
unenforceable. You can ask the Tibetans and  
Uyghurs how it all worked out.
All right, so Mao's strategy:  
he had a strategy of disintegrating the enemy 
army and let me tell you how that one worked. 
In every county, you select a large number of 
workers and peasant comrades, people below the  
radar, and then you insinuate them into the enemy 
army to become soldiers, porters, and cooks.  
You can use women to do this as well. 
Talk about people who are below the radar. 
You're creating a nucleus of a Communist Party to 
erode them from within, and eventually, it'll have  
a shattering effect. He said, also, part of this 
disintegrating the enemy has to do with leniency. 
Sun Tzu advocates: never put your enemy 
on death ground. Death ground means that  
you just have no hope, that you're a 
dead person if you don't fight. So,  
your only hope is to fight.
If you put someone on death ground,  
they tend to fight with incredible 
willpower. And Mao is: don't do that. 
So, what he did when you capture people, 
propagandize a little, recruit the willing,  
but release the unwilling, so that the 
comparison of communist leniency and  
nationalist brutality becomes absolutely 
stark in this otherwise pitiless war. 
Okay, that's the civil war. Now, we're going 
to go to the second problem, which was Japan,  
the regional war. Mao made a really thoughtful 
assessment of what were the key characteristics of  
China that would determine what kind of military 
strategy he would use. And this is his assessment. 
He said, "Okay, China is a large, semi-colonial 
country. It's an undeveloped country." Point  
one. "Second, its enemy is really strong." Point 
two. "Thirdly, the Red Army is weak. And fourthly,  
there's an agrarian revolution going on." And 
from this, he concluded that revolution was  
definitely possible, but it's going to take a long 
time. So he didn't kid himself about quick wins. 
He's going to come up with a 
strategy for protracted warfare.  
And he thought that Japan had certain weaknesses 
that the communists could leverage. For instance,  
the Japanese had inadequate manpower to 
garrison a country the size of China. 
This meant that guerrillas could roam 
far and wide behind Japanese lines. Also,  
the Japanese were brutal, just gratuitously 
brutal, and they're outsiders. This means  
that the peasantry are naturally going 
to gravitate towards the communists,  
just simply regardless of what the communists 
do, but based on what the Japanese are doing,  
they're going to gravitate towards the communists.
Also, the Japanese had grossly underestimated the  
Chinese. And as a result of underestimating the 
Chinese, they made errors. When they made errors,  
they started quarreling among themselves 
and making more errors and the communists  
could leverage these things.
Mao's most famous paradigm  
theory is his three stages of people's war. 
The first stage is the strategic defensive.  
It's the "prevent defeat" phase.
The last phase, phase three,  
is the strategic offensive, the "delivery 
victory" phase. In the first phase,  
you're focusing on the peasantry. In the last 
phase, you're annihilating the enemy army. 
And if you look at activities that go on in each 
phase, the activities of phase one and two never  
cease. Rather, you add additional activities 
as competence increases. So, in phase one,  
you're doing popular mobilization, base area 
building, triangle building, guerrilla warfare. 
And then, as you get more of these things, then 
you can start engaging in mobile warfare, try  
your hand at a little conventional warfare, reach 
out with diplomacy. And then if you go further  
in stage three, then you're talking positional 
warfare, and you're going to have the war-winning  
battle. And how do you get from the phases?
Well, the transition from phase one to two  
is basically you have a critical mass of base 
areas, cadres, armed forces that you can move  
into phase two. But the problem of being in 
phase two is what had looked like isolated  
acts of banditry in phase one to the incumbent 
government, now the incumbent government gets it,  
that they're facing an insurgency bent on 
regime change, and the regime changes strategy. 
So the communists are no longer under the 
radar, but they're in the crosshairs. And  
it's dangerous because they're weak and the enemy 
is strong. So when you transition to phase two,  
initially it is quite dangerous.
And here's Mao writing about these  
problems and saying, "Look, in these stages 
one and two, the enemy is trying to have us  
concentrate our main forces for a decisive 
engagement," i.e. decisive in their favor,  
they'll win the war because they'll annihilate us. 
And of course, this is what General Westmoreland  
was trying to do in the Vietnam War, getting 
the North Vietnamese to concentrate so he could  
blow them off the map. And of course, they'd 
read their Mao and didn’t do that nonsense. 
Mao was saying you only fight when you're sure 
of victory. Also, in order to get to phase three,  
you need a big friend. Why? Because phase three 
is conventional warfare, which requires infinite  
supplies of conventional armaments that requires 
an industrial base to produce it, and somewhere  
like China lacks this industrial base.
So, good old Soviet Union played this  
role the world over. And so this is 
the secret sauce of people's war:  
if you want to get to phase three, you need a 
big buddy. That's where the Soviet Union came in. 
And so this is why Mao determines that Yan’an 
is going to be his terminal point of retreat.  
He's fighting his way through to the Soviet 
Union. No kidding, you've got to have the  
conventional arms. To fight this stuff.
What's interesting about Mao's description  
of people's war is it actually applied 
not so much to the war with Japan,  
which he claimed it applied to, but rather 
to the civil war with the Nationalists. And  
here is the key. Mao didn't actually fight the 
regional war against Japan. The Nationalists did. 
The Nationalists did every bit of the 
conventional fighting, except one,  
and that's the Hundred Regiments campaign that 
Mao fought in North China in 1940, and he was  
smeared. The Japanese responded with a "three 
alls" campaign, which is "kill all, burn all,  
loot all," which is what they did. And it wiped 
out loads of communist base areas in North China. 
So, Mao never tried that ever again, and 
he certainly didn't write about it in his  
collected works. Don't talk about failures 
there. So, it's interesting. What he's  
talking about really applies to the civil war.
And Mao understands these different layers. So,  
as the Nationalists are busy fighting the 
Japanese and actually being destroyed by them,  
the communists are pretending that they're 
fighting the Japanese. They're later going  
to take credit for it and say, "We won 
against the Japanese," which is nonsense. 
There was also the United States in that as 
well. Because he's using that to strengthen the  
communists during all of this rural mobilization. 
So, when Japan's defeated and the communists,  
when the civil war resumes full 
bore, he's in a good situation. 
Okay, that's it on Mao, the operational military 
leader at the operational level. Now let's put  
it all together as Mao the grand strategist, of 
linking all elements of national power into a  
coherent strategy. These are Mao's instruments 
of national power: the peasantry, propaganda,  
land reform, base areas, institution 
building, warfare, and diplomacy. 
The US military, when they're thinking about 
elements of national power, love this little  
framework: DIME. D is for diplomacy, I is 
intelligence, M for military, E for economics,  
as being critical elements of national power.
It's better than only looking at the military  
elements, at least you got three more things. But 
if you look at Mao, this is not a cookie-cutter  
event. This is a different society, different 
national elements of national power are available.  
You've got to get to the other side of the tennis 
court net to see what the other team is doing. 
Mao is famous for all these reasons, but 
also for his sinification of Marxism,  
where he makes all the things that I’ve told 
you about, makes his version of Marxism much  
more applicable to these countries, the newly 
independent countries after World War II,  
of how they put things together. He 
positions himself to replace Stalin,  
who dies in 1953, as the leader of communism.
Mao was prescient on numerous levels.  
He was certainly prescient about the 
centrality of the peasantry. He was way  
ahead of his times on the importance of women.
He was calculating and cunning on how he was  
going to use minorities and POWs. He 
had proven his kudoi and determination  
with his military strategy.
He also anticipated when the  
Japanese war in China would stalemate, 
and he also anticipated, more or less,  
when the United States was going to get into the 
war in Asia. He's the great sinifier of Marxism. 
Mao produced all kinds of concepts and paradigms 
that are useful for insurgents who are trying to  
take over the host from within. I've listed 
a variety of them here, and I'm going to  
go through them in turn. These are the things 
that the counterinsurgent then has to counter. 
All right, rural mobilization. This is obviously 
a big deal in Mao. If you compare—and I'm going  
to be doing a lot of comparisons with the Vietnam 
War and the Korean War because they're communists  
and all these things—you can see Mao's rural 
mobilization was very successful in China.  
The North Vietnamese rural mobilization was 
also really good. South Korea, not so much. 
Why? The leader of North Korea was trying 
to mobilize the peasantry in the south,  
that wasn't so successful. And why? Syngman 
Rhee, the leader of South Korea, immediately  
did land reform, and this glues loyalty of 
soldiers to the leadership doing this. Maybe that  
is not the only factor, but an important factor 
for why the Korean War turns out differently. 
Base areas. Mao says those are really important. 
The North Vietnamese used them to great effect.  
They had all kinds of areas in the south and then 
on the borders of South Vietnam. North Korea, not  
so much. It couldn't form base areas in the South.
Why? It's a peninsula which the US Navy cut off.  
It's also cold. So where are you going to flee 
if you want to do a base area? I think it's up a  
mountain in South Korea, and that will get cold in 
the winter, and you'll probably freeze to death. 
I believe “Al Qaeda” means "the base." I believe 
that's the correct translation. So if you're  
thinking about ISIS or whatever's left of it, 
you can go back to Mao's ideas about base areas,  
that you need a particular kind of geography 
that's good for the defensive. You've got to have  
a big party organization, a lot of local support, 
and you have to have military forces there. 
Does Al Qaeda—well, it's going to be ISIS 
or something—do they have all four of these  
things or can you remove any one of them?
Another idea from Mao is luring the enemy  
in deep. Mao had done that very successfully 
in the first three encirclement campaigns,  
and then he was removed from command, so he wasn't 
doing that anymore. Again, in the final phases  
of the Chinese Civil War, the `45 to `49 event, 
Mao lures the Nationalists deep into Manchuria. 
The Nationalists are a South China phenomenon. I 
showed you the map. Chiang Kai-shek starts in the  
south and he goes way up north, so he's weakest 
in the north. Mao lures him way up there in  
Manchuria, and then he springs a trap and destroys 
Chiang Kai-shek's armies up there. Then the entire  
civil war wraps up within a year of that.
Mao also lured good old General MacArthur,  
who fancied himself a great Asianist in the 
Korean War. MacArthur goes all the way up  
to the Yalu River, right on the Chinese border in 
the Korean War, and Mao springs a trap. MacArthur  
didn't realize that 350,000 Chinese troops had 
been infiltrated around him. Oops, missed that. 
It did not work out well. But for the 
US Navy, now, it needs to think about,  
what about being lured into the South and East 
China Seas and then the Chinese pulling the trap.  
There are places you don't need to go. The Chinese 
may have to go there, but maybe you don't have to. 
Another one is terminal point of retreat. I've 
talked about Yan'an being a really good one,  
and that worked. Then when the Manchurian campaign 
initially wasn't going well for Mao, he retreated  
up to Siping, which is a little bit north, 
and that worked well enough. But when Chiang  
Kai-shek tried to pick these Manchurian cities 
as a place to retreat in Manchuria, bad news. 
There's only one railway system that 
gets you south out of Manchuria. You  
suppose the Communists don't know about 
it? They encircled the Nationalists in  
these cities and destroyed them there.
So when you're thinking about insurgents  
and things, think about, well, if you knock 
them out of one area, where might they go next?  
Another concept from Mao is disintegrating 
enemy forces, which is what happens to the  
Nationalists. Think about it: Chiang Kai-shek had 
been fighting since the 1920s, forever and ever,  
and he fought the Japanese, they're brutal. The 
United States had trouble fighting the Japanese,  
and Chiang Kai-shek fought them alone 
for a long time before we joined the war. 
And yet, he loses a battle in '48 in Manchuria, 
and that's it. The rest of the country wraps up.  
So what was going on there? Or the South 
Vietnamese: they'd been fighting forever. 
And then the whole place just wraps up. And 
the same thing happened with Japan in World  
War II. They'd been fighting all over the place 
forever, fighting us brutally. And then in 1945,  
we don't even have to invade the home islands.
Think how unusual that is. The Germans fought  
every street on the way to Berlin; the 
Japanese quit. This is about disintegrating  
the enemy and why it happens.
But what you can say in all those  
three cases is the warfare had been 
going on for an incredibly long time,  
and it was ruinous. The places in question were 
ruined, so don't expect that to happen too fast. 
Of course, Mao's big contribution was his three 
stages of people's war. Mao presents them as  
sequential: you go from one to two to three, and 
tada, you win. And they're cumulative, right? 
You do certain things, and then you get to 
phase two, and you've had this cumulative  
effect of destroying enemy forces. You 
get even more accumulating casualties  
on the other side, and finally, you win.
A student of mine said that's actually not  
a great way to look at it, or there's an even 
better way to use it. It's like a metric of how  
an insurgency goes up and down, so that ISIS may 
be on the cusp of going into stage three. I don't  
know that they ever really—well, possibly, with 
all the equipment they got initially—or whether  
then they get knocked back to stage one, where 
you wonder whether they still exist anymore,  
and come back and forth. Anyway, that was that 
person's take. I thought I'd pass it along to you. 
All right. I have one last thing to talk about. 
Mao, when you read these 7,000 pages—and I don't  
recommend it—one is struck by all these dualities. 
I think it goes back to Yin and Yang analysis,  
which is very prominent in traditional 
Chinese thinking. So, if you look at  
Mao discussing triangle building, it's in 
terms of the presence or absence of factors,  
presence and absence being opposites.
So you're going from the absence of political  
power to the seizure of political power, from the 
absence of the Red Army to the creation of the Red  
Army. It goes on and on. Studying the differences 
and connections between dualities is a task of  
studying strategy, and it's really everything.
To defend in order to attack, to retreat in  
order to advance. It goes on and on, 
and it's all about correctly orienting  
yourself between these opposites.
So, “oppose protracted campaigns  
and the strategy of a short war. Uphold 
the strategy of a protracted war in a  
short campaign” and I'm starting to lose it.
You've got to put everything in the context  
of each other: losses, replacements, 
fighting, resting, concentration,  
and dispersion and I'm thinking, "I 
don't get this. Mao's bipolar disorder." 
So I went to this gentleman, Brigadier 
General Samuel B. Griffith. He is the  
only translator into English of Sun Tzu 
who has a distinguished military career,  
and also, he went on to get a DPhil—it's 
like a PhD—from Oxford in military history. 
If you look at his career, he's in China during 
the Japanese escalation of the Sino-Japanese  
War. He's back in China, does another tour at the 
end of the Chinese Civil War. He gets top marks  
in the military's Chinese language exam.
Oh, look at these details: Navy Cross,  
Purple Heart, Distinguished Service Cross. 
He's a distinguished man, and for retirement,  
he decides he's going to go get the Oxford degree, 
and he writes the translation of Sun Tzu. He is  
the only translator of Sun Tzu who translates "死地" 
as "death ground." Other people, it's like, oh,  
I don't know, I can't remember the words, like, 
I don't know, "contested ground," something else. 
But I'm guessing that when he chose those 
words, "death ground," it's because when  
he was thinking about it, it might well have 
conjured up his memories of what exactly it  
was like to be on Guadalcanal or New Georgia. 
He has provided insights- oh also the other  
thing to mention about him is he's really modest.
I had to dig around to find these biographical  
details. They're not on the cover of his 
book which is where they should be. And his  
service to his country continues to this day.
Because it's his translation that continues  
to educate officers over 40 years after his 
death. But here's his take: "In every apparent  
disadvantage, some advantage is to be found. The 
yin is not wholly yin, and the yang is not wholly  
yang. It is only the wise general," said Sun Tzu, 
"who is able to recognize this fact and turn it  
to good account." And of course, Mao could, and 
he did. But in peacetime, choices are not binary,  
they're graduated, and evolution is much more 
conducive to economic development than revolution.
So here's something I'm confused by. You 
were talking about Mao as a shrewd commander,  
somebody who had studied not only the military 
but had also compiled these rigorous records  
of farm life and agriculture. And then 
you fast forward to when he's in power,  
and you go to the Great Leap Forward, and some 
of the things that he was doing, you just can't  
imagine that somebody thought this was a good 
idea: that peasants would take off the harvest,  
wouldn't attend to the crops, but they're going 
to make iron in their backyards. They're going to  
shoot the sparrows and have a locust infestation.
How do we square this shrewdness in the  
beginning and these idiocracy-level 
ideas in the Great Leap Forward? 
Well, first of all, you need to think about 
what his objective is, which number one  
is to stay in power, right? And number two 
is probably Communist Party in power and  
his visions of revolution. So that's one thing.
Then you're worried about the welfare of people  
as if that's the primary objective. It most 
certainly is not. And then he may have assumed  
that it came along with these things, and that's 
a whole problem with communist ideology is people  
don't believe it because they know it's wrong, 
they believe it because it's right. There's a  
whole problem with that about labor theories 
of value and things. It turns out there are  
things called services that are also valuable.
So the basic theory that he's implementing is  
incorrect. It just takes the communists a 
little while—some of them haven't figured  
it out—but it takes them a little while to 
figure out there are parts that don't work.  
But there's a whole other piece to him, if you 
think about our own world, how much expertise does  
any individual have? It's amazing the man reunited 
a continent, and he did all those things. Then to  
expect him to run a peacetime economy is crazy.
But of course he wants to do it so he stays  
there. Or if you think about like in Britain, 
Winston Churchill: a great wartime leader, but  
he's booted out of office right after that war. If 
you think about different capabilities of people,  
don't expect one individual to do everything.
So that's a whole other problem. When Mao is  
running stuff from afar—this is a country with 
how many people? It hadn't hit a billion then, but  
it's hundreds of millions and it's been shattered 
by warlord rule forever. And so how are you going  
to extend central control to the countryside? 
Really tricky. I suspect that’s why he puts them  
on communes, because it lines up with communism, 
but it also lines up with party control. 
Because if you put all this vast 
population—because most people are  
peasants—on communes, then you control whether 
they eat or don't. You truly control them. So it's  
those factors. It's so big when you start putting 
a policy in place from Beijing. And then how that  
actually fans out over the whole country, it's 
got to be a mess. Different localities and things. 
But when I compare him to other, 
even other communist leaders. 
Which ones?
So if you look at Stalin,  
for example, yes, he causes the Holodomor, 
right? Three million people die, but- 
Uh, details, yeah.
But that was an intentional famine  
where he was trying to root out the kulaks. The 
Great Leap Forward was- he wasn't trying to kill  
tens of millions of Chinese. And there’s instances 
in the 20s where Stalin threatens to resign,  
and people close to him, Molotov and others, 
say, "You can't do it because nobody else can  
run the government like you can."
Yeah, right. [gun gesture] 
True, but the level of…
[noose gesture] Yeah? 
Stalin was a devoted communist, and that led 
to many deaths. But he didn't seem deluded  
in the same kind of way that Mao was.
Well, first of all, Russia is quite a  
developed country compared to China. And if you 
think about it, Russia had been industrializing  
since the late 19th century, and China's a 
much later event. Russia also has all sorts of  
institutions and things that China was lacking.
So already, Stalin has many more tools at his  
disposal than what the Chinese communists are 
going to have. Also, the kind of warfare. Think  
about the warfare in China. You got the 
Taiping Rebellion, only the biggest of  
the peasant rebellions of the 19th century, and I 
can't remember if it was 20 or 30 million people. 
That's a large number, right? Because I think 
World War II is supposed to be like 55 million.  
So there are a whole series of these peasant 
rebellions in the 19th century that go on for, I  
don't know, 25, 50 years, one's here, one's there. 
By the end of it, they've basically devastated  
parts of every province. Then you overlay this 
with the Warlords coming in and all of that.  
Overlay that with the communist-nationalist 
thing. Overlay that with the Japanese. 
You're talking about a massively trashed country. 
And think about it. I'll give you another example.  
For Americans in the room. And for others 
who aren't Americans, you'll have to,  
based on your dealings with Americans.
This country had a civil war. It ran,  
what, four or five years? It was mostly in the 
South. Northerners came, joined armies, and then  
went to the South. The institutions of government 
didn't change in Washington. They certainly did in  
the Confederacy. But those were new things, 
right? Because they were trying to secede. 
And the losing side of that war still hasn't 
gotten over it. Right? So if that's what's going  
on here, and that thing wasn't nearly as brutal 
as the civil wars... At the end of the Civil War,  
who gets… Lee's army is allowed to 
go home. They aren't shot on sight. 
Which would be the kind of thing that went on 
in the Russian Civil War, Chinese Civil War. So,  
if that kind of bitterness and unsettledness is 
still present in this highly institutionalized,  
wealthy country, this one, you better believe 
China's a mess. So then when you're wondering why  
Mao can't surf that wave, no one can.
Just to linger on this... 
Uh-oh. New exit strategy.
Even if he's not a specialist on agriculture,  
and even if China is a hard country to govern, 
he was somebody who was shrewd in the sense of,  
when these battles were happening, I 
imagine if somebody came up to him and said,  
"We're winning these battles," and it's a total 
fabrication, they're in fact losing these battles,  
he would have been quick enough to realize, 
"Listen, this is just wishful thinking. I realize  
you're just trying to make me feel good, but 
this is a lie and I'm not going to stand for it." 
Whereas, if you go to the Great Leap 
Forward, millions of Chinese are dying,  
and they come to him and say, "The grain harvests 
have never been higher." And he's like, "Great,  
let's export our grain." And there's this ability 
to have this basic discernment of what is actually  
going on. That situational awareness is gone.
Okay, there's, no. Mao doesn't become canonized  
as Mao, or- I'm mixing metaphors- the 
Emperor of China until victory in the  
Korean War. So in the early period...
Oh, Mao is supposed to have written  
this book called On Guerrilla Warfare. It is not 
written by Mao. It took time to figure it out,  
for outsiders. It's written by Peng Dehuai and 
others, his generals. And so there were many  
people's ideas that went into winning the 
civil war. It is not just Mao. And then  
he winds up purging these people later.
And so it's not until after the… During  
the Korean War, he's busy purging everybody 
massively because you can use it as a big excuse,  
right? We got this war, we don't want to hear 
from these people. And so he has purged more  
and more and more and more people, so that 
there are fewer and fewer counterarguments.  
It's a real case against dictatorship. For all 
the chaos of party politics, you're at least  
forced to confront the counterargument. 
It is a healthier situation to be in. 
Let's go back to the end of World War II.
Okay. 
So if you look at basically all the main actors, 
none of them get even most of what they want. Some  
of them get the exact opposite of what they want.
Germany and Japan initiate to expand their  
territory. Both of them end up with the smallest 
territory they've had in a long time. Britain  
starts the war- or not starts, but enjoins the 
war- in order to defend Poland. Poland ends up  
in totalitarian occupation afterwards, 
and the British Empire disintegrates. 
But Stalin ends up with the borders of 
the Soviet Union vastly expanded. China  
becomes Communist. How do we make sense? 
Is Stalin just a master strategist here? 
I believe there's a detail of how many tens 
of millions of Russians died on that thing. 
So great, it's a personal success for him. The 
numbers of Russians who were destroyed in that  
are incredible. So, okay, for dictators, 
yeah, they can have personal successes,  
I think more, it's in these horrible wars that 
dictators can rise. Also, Great Depressions  
provide hothouse conditions for dictators.
I think the lesson is the last thing you want to  
do is fight a world war, but as Britain discovered 
in World War II, if Hitler's insistent, you're  
stuck. It might be a lesson for our own day. Isn't 
this Ukraine's problem? They didn't want to fight  
a war. What are you going to do? Putin launched.
We don't exactly want to fight a war. Well,  
what are you going to do? Let Putin do whatever 
he wants forever, however long he wants? The  
reason you all are prosperous is there's a 
global maritime order in which people obey  
rules because it is so much cheaper to obey 
rules. Because what do you do when people  
break the rules? You hire a lawyer.
It's not protection money or starting  
to blow up each other's buildings and 
destroying wealth at an incredible clip,  
which is what you're seeing going on in Ukraine. 
So these things are consequential, none of us  
makes all the choices, and when other people make 
bad choices, you're stuck responding to them. 
Before Mao, before the Communists 
completely won the civil war,  
did people anticipate truly how terrible the 
communist power would end up being in China? 
I doubt it. I think Communism was a new 
thing, right? So you've got it going on  
with the Russians. I mean the Nationalists 
were telling us that it would be like this,  
and we looked at them and go, "What 
could be worse than the Nationalists?" 
Because they were in a desperate situation with 
all that the Japanese were doing, and then they  
get blamed for it all. Yeah there can be something 
worse than that, which we call communists. 
But I don't know that anyone could have 
predicted... Can anyone do a crystal ball  
what the world's going to be like in 10 
years? It seems when you read the history  
books that it had to be that way, and yet 
in our own lives, we know it's contingency,  
of why things turn out as the aggregate of all of 
our choices. How would you ever calculate that? 
I wonder if there's a lesson in there that America 
should be more open about supporting corrupt,  
somewhat autocratic regimes because, especially 
when they're facing fanatical ideologues, because  
things really can get much, much, much worse.
I think Americans need to worry about  
overextension. Any country has to worry about 
overextension. We have finite resources. Also,  
you're talking about sending your fellow 
Americans to go get themselves killed,  
and that's quite something to ask someone to make 
that kind of sacrifice. It had better be worth it. 
There are 300 million Americans, 
while the world's got 8 billion. Uh,  
be cautious. What's key on this maritime order, 
the big insurance policy of it all, is our allies  
and institutions. This is the great gift of the 
Greatest Generation, of having created the UN,  
which is how many millions of lives have been 
saved from polio vaccines and other things  
that come through the UN? Do not dismiss these 
organizations, they've done a lot. Or the EU. 
Work through these things, and listen 
to your allies. They will have insights,  
and there is power in allies. Tell me, who China's 
allies are? The crazy man in Korea who can't even  
feed people in the 21st century. Although he 
certainly feeds himself, but that’s a whole- 
It's incredible. Who are China's friends? 
I mean, Iran, a theocracy? I mean,  
talk about passé. Who does theocracies 
anymore? Okay, the Iranians. Good on them. 
After World War II, the Soviets are giving 
the communists in China tremendous amounts  
of leftover weapons from the Japanese and a bunch 
of other goods, supporting them tremendously. At  
the same time, Truman is wishy-washy and does an 
actual arms embargo on Chiang Kai-shek in 1946.  
The Marshall Plan for Europe is $13 billion to 
help build up defenses against communist appeal. 
At the same time, Truman has to be forced 
in 1948 by Congress to give a couple hundred  
million to China, literally one-hundredth of 
what was given to Europe. And by that time,  
it's too late for Chiang Kai-shek.
If you look at that record, it seems  
like we abysmally messed up after World War II 
in helping the Nationalists stay in power, right? 
Do not exaggerate the capabilities of any one 
country for openers. But I think it's really  
important to distinguish between nation-building 
and nation rebuilding. If you're rebuilding,  
which is what happens in Japan and 
Germany, they already had full-up  
institutions, modern economies before the war.
They had no problems with educational institutions  
going all the way up, judicial institutions, they 
had competent police forces, competent… They had  
parliaments and other things. So that when you 
give Germans some cash, and Japanese as well,  
they know exactly how to recreate things 
and rapidly produce modern institutions.  
You're talking about China. They never had these 
institutions. There is no indigenous expertise. 
Oh, and by the way, what's the illiteracy 
rate in China compared to Japan? Whoa. No  
one reads in China, and everyone reads 
in Japan. It's not quite that bad. 
And we've had this problem in Iraq and 
Afghanistan. So we decide we're going to do  
the de-Ba'athification thing, and then we think 
the police are going to still show up and work.  
Except no, that's not how it works, they haven't 
got these institutions. And so it's not feasible.  
A Marshall Plan in China would not have worked.
And also, we had really competent foreign service  
officers in China in this period. Why? They're the 
children of missionaries. And so they spoke fluent  
Chinese and had a deep understanding of China.
And they were saying it's hopeless, that there is  
no way Chiang Kai-shek's going to win this thing 
because he's hated by the peasantry, which he was,  
because for the reasons I've told you. If he's 
busy dragooning them into his armies because he  
feels he has no choices, whereas the Communists 
are giving them land and educating them, you  
better believe who the peasants are supporting.
And the missionaries, they were then caught up in  
the McCarthy purges and were just about ruined. 
Lost their jobs in the State Department and  
elsewhere, only to be exonerated 10, 15, 20 years 
later when they've already lost their careers  
and who knows how they raised their families?
I thought it was the case that George Marshall,  
who was the envoy to China, the diplomat. 
I thought it was a case that later on  
they realized it was hopeless and so then 
they stopped supporting Chiang, but, but- 
It's at the time, different people 
realized it at different times. 
But the reason they didn't support Chiang 
as much as they should have was because they  
thought he was- I mean, the Communists 
almost seemed like hopeless underdogs. 
It was just thought that Chiang is going to 
win and therefore we don't have to support him. 
No no no no.
They were constantly  
goading the Nationalists to form some sort of 
ceasefire, do some sort of coalition government,  
when in fact what it should have done is like, 
no, you have to make sure that you keep China. 
No, it was considered hopeless. This is 
called making a net assessment of not  
what you want it to be, but an accurate 
one. They believed it was not feasible. 
Even in 1945, 46?
You're talking hundreds  
of millions of people. We can't even 
deal with Afghanistan today. With what,  
20 million people? It's not feasible. It's at the 
end of World War II. American GIs are sick of it,  
and as are their parents, of fighting more wars.
We didn't have to send GIs,  
we just had to not cut off support.
Europe has been leveled and there's  
this absolute fear that the Communists are going 
to move into Europe, which actually counts for  
Western economies in those days. The Italian and 
French Communist parties were incredibly strong,  
so all the focus of limited resources 
is going to make sure that Europe  
settles out. We don't have infinite resources.
I feel like you could do better than 1/100th  
of the Marshall Plan to keep China from turning 
Communist. And look what the consequences were:  
Vietnam, we had to fight, Korea, we had 
to fight, Cambodia, the genocide there. 
But you can't solve all these things. 
There are things that are not feasible. 
I'm going to linger on this because...
You're an optimist. But anyway, maybe you're  
right, but anyway you've got my take on it and 
I can't prove I'm right. That would be my take. 
I remember in your book, which is to your right, 
The War for Asia, there's a passage where you say  
there are so many sort of individual, contingent 
things that led to the Communists taking power. 
Yes.
If any of these factors was off… 
Yes.
The outcome might have been different. 
Yes.
Of all these factors, the  
fact that American support, or lack thereof, was 
not one of them, it just seems like it was a super  
contingent thing. But also, America not being 
as strong as it should have just didn't matter. 
I don't know- it's just not politically 
feasible. I mean, talk about it? 
Put yourself back in those days. You've already 
done a three-year tour in World War II because,  
in those days, you started serving whenever 
it was in the war, and you weren't coming  
home until the war was over. It was none of 
this nine-month tour, a year tour here and  
there. You were there for the duration.
So you get home. And then you're told,  
"Go make nice to the Chinese and go get 
yourself killed there." How is that going  
to fly in your family? Probably poorly.
I mean, again, you don't have to send the  
GIs there. You can just not 
do an arms embargo on them. 
I think it was so minor, by then it's too late. 
The great question is, some would argue that in  
1946 when Marshall tells Chiang Kai-shek to halt 
his advance—this is when he's doing quite well—and  
when I mentioned that the terminal point of 
retreat for the Communists was up in Siping,  
Manchuria, some would argue that 
Marshall should never have done that,  
he should have let the Nationalists go all the 
way up, and that would have changed the outcome  
of the Chinese Civil War. You could make an 
argument that that might be true. Here's the  
counterargument, and I don't know the answer.
If you look at a map of China, or imagine one,  
Manchuria is way up, it's like a salient into 
Communist territory because it's bordering  
all the Soviet Union. And then it's got quite a 
coastline, but the Soviets had blockaded that, so  
nothing's getting in that way. The only way, given 
the Chinese railway system, is that literally one  
train line connects Manchuria to South China.
So, it means Chiang Kai-shek's movements are  
incredibly predictable. So one argument you 
could make, and people have, and I don't know  
the answer, none of us does, is that, hey, that 
was the big error. So if that's the big error,  
the mistake- and this is a common 
one that Americans make so this is  
worth talking about- is Americans often don't 
look at warring parties to understand if they are  
primary adversaries there is no way you're going 
to make them make nice. So the United States had  
trouble for years trying to get Pakistanis and 
Indians to cooperate, and it would want to give  
aid to both of them and just didn't get it.
As long as they're primary adversaries,  
you aid one, it infuriates the other, and 
they're never going to cooperate the two  
of them. Or I suspect what was going on in Iraq 
and Afghanistan, so you want to have a democracy,  
and you want to have all the parties represented.
Well, if they all want to obliterate each other,  
the last thing they want to do is have 
representation of the other side, right? So,  
if you have parties that want to exterminate 
each other, the idea of getting them to  
cooperate is impossible. So don't try it.
That would be the lesson from this thing.  
We kept trying to do a coalition 
government with the communists  
and the nationalists. It's a non-starter.
But the United States was a very isolationist  
country and didn't have the attitude of a great 
power until after World War II. In World War I,  
we felt dragged into it, and these horrible 
wars, and being quite irresponsible during the  
Great Depression, and just ignoring everybody 
else's problems, didn't want to hear about it.  
And then we get a World War II out of that, 
and then we rethink that whole proposition. 
If you had to speculate, suppose the Nationalists 
win. In Taiwan, because they're forced to,  
they have a very pro-American policy. But if 
they had won in the mainland China, would it  
have been similar where mainland China just turns 
into Taiwan, or would it have been different? 
No, I'm sure it would be different. One of 
the reasons Taiwan is Taiwan is after they  
lost the civil war and they are on the island 
of Taiwan, they did a big after-action analysis  
of what went wrong and they decided it was 
corruption and that it was land reform that  
they needed to fix those things. But they couldn't 
do land reform on the mainland because that's  
their officer corps. But when they come to Taiwan, 
they can more than redistribute Taiwanese land,  
which they do and it's bloody. Because the 
Taiwanese don't want their land redistributed. The  
Taiwanese were given bonds, and they thought those 
bonds would be like the pieces of paper that were  
issued in the mainland, i.e worth nothing, but 
actually after time they became quite valuable. 
Land reform was bloody in Taiwan, but today 
Taiwan has a very equal income distribution. 
And what is the explanation for -- you just 
had these tallies of numbers up of how many  
deaths through different events. The famine 
obviously makes sense, a lot of people would die. 
But you just go down the list, and there are so 
many things where a couple million people die,  
and it's like one out of ten items that 
happen within a span of a couple of decades. 
It's famine. If you have warfare, you 
have famine. It's not mostly bang,  
bang, you're dead. That goes on too, but it's 
starvation when you disrupt things in this way. 
Why didn't the Communists have the same 
troubles that the Kuomintang had in terms  
of not being able to pay its soldiers? I mean, it 
was the same China, right? It wasn't a developed  
economy. So why didn't they have trouble 
paying their soldiers and retaining them? 
Oh, I think it's because everyone's on 
board. The peasants have got their land,  
the only way they're ever going to keep it, they 
think, is by supporting the Communists and Mao  
isn't living any kind of luxurious life, there's 
no -- that was another thing. You have these rich  
officer corps and the Nationalists flaunting 
their wealth among absolutely starving people.  
And that's another reason why they're hated.
Whereas the Communists never had those people,  
so no one's flaunting their wealth. You 
saw the pictures of Mao and his beloved  
there in the incredibly baggy clothing. 
No one's got luxury wear or anything. 
Although after they won, Mao is famously a fan 
of luxury and has -- right? In a way that I think  
Stalin would sleep on his couch in his office.
Yeah, I don't know the details on Mao. Mao  
had other things that had to do 
with little girls, but anyway. 
Okay, you were just mentioning China, this period 
of turmoil, constantly there’s insurgencies and  
chaos, and then we go to all the turmoil that Mao 
causes, all the people, when he gets into power,  
tens of millions of people are dying. And yet, 
there's never a major insurgency after he takes  
power. There's never a coup that works.
Oh communists are good at this. When the  
North Vietnamese won, what do they promptly 
get? Famine. And in Vietnam, I think you have  
kind of three harvests, like how do you ever 
have famine in that place? But yeah, they did. 
This is the “brilliance” of communism is 
this commissar system and the party system,  
and how they set up their government, it’s 
incredibly effective about maintaining power.  
It's very effective about seizing power 
during warfare, maintaining it thereafter,  
but it does not deliver prosperity, it delivers 
compounding poverty, take a look at North  
Korea. It's a mess, but the man's in power.
Why don't the high-level officials in the CCP,  
after they see the impact of the Great Leap 
Forward, the Liu Shaoqis and the Deng Xiaopings,  
why don't they-
They did. 
Well they- he wasn’t running day-to-day 
affairs. But in terms of making sure he's  
never in a position to, in the future, do 
something like the Cultural Revolution? 
They try. This is when you get Peng Dehuai, who- 
he was the general in charge of forces during the  
Korean War, and also Long March generation. He 
had lost several of his siblings to starvation  
over the course of these civil wars. And he and 
Liu Shaoqi pulled the plug on Mao, and then Mao  
is demoted from one of his positions, and that's 
when you get the Cultural Revolution because Mao  
is on his way out of power from these guys.
So what does Mao do? He gets out of Beijing,  
and he rallies the youth, the Red Guards. These 
are the children who've been educated in communist  
education about how wonderful the communists are 
and how beloved Chairman Mao is. So Chairman Mao  
tells the teenagers that they should be in charge.
Think about teenagers: not much life experience,  
but telling them they're in charge. And then 
they start out by killing off their teachers,  
right? They have teachers they probably don't 
like, and it's incredibly empowering. Then  
they start working their way up the 
educational system and fan outward. 
And it's like a semi-civil war. And 
then this is when Lin Biao comes in,  
who is a military leader, and Mao is going to 
use him to restore order, but after he's ousted  
all the people who are going to get rid of him, 
that's what the Cultural Revolution is about. 
And it is ruinous for production, right? Doing all 
this. And you're gutting your educational system.  
All the people who gave the hard grades, who 
may have actually known something, they're gone. 
From Mao's perspective, didn't the Cultural 
Revolution work extremely well? Because- 
For him, yeah. Not for China.
He launches it because he sees Khrushchev's  
speech in 1956 denouncing Stalin and what he had 
done, and didn't want the same thing to happen to  
him after he dies. And today, look, the portrait 
of Mao hangs in the square, and he's revered in  
a way that Hitler or Stalin aren't revered in 
their countries, despite killing more people. 
Well, though I think Stalin's having a bit of a 
comeback with Vladimir Putin. And Vladimir Putin  
is starting to mimic more of the centralized... 
He's going to recentralize his economy in ways  
that start looking like the old one.
When people say things like,  
"Xi Jinping is acting like Mao," how do 
you react knowing how Mao actually behaved? 
Oh, Xi Jinping apparently reveres Mao. My 
understanding about Xi Jinping's education  
is his dad was a very high-level Communist leader 
who was purged but not killed, and sent to sort  
of interior north somewhere in China.
And so when Xi was on the, what is it,  
the "down to the countryside" movement, where a 
lot of kids were sent to really horrible places,  
he was sent, I think, where his dad was. 
Or where protectors who liked his dad  
were. So it wasn't as bad as it could be.
But he was not well-educated because he  
couldn't be in that period, right? It's during 
the... He may have degrees from places, but the  
institution in question during the Cultural 
Revolution wasn't delivering an education. 
So he's a believer in communism. Don't ever 
kid yourself that the Communist Party of China  
doesn't believe in communism now. They think 
they've modified some of the economic stuff  
under Deng Xiaoping, but now they're 
recentralizing it right back the way it was. 
Given the fact that he personally suffered 
during the Cultural Revolution... I think  
there's a story that at some point, because his 
dad is announced, he was announced and he tried to  
come back to their home to get fed by his mother, 
and his mother had to turn him away. This happens  
to him during the Cultural Revolution.
How do you explain these CCP officials  
who personally suffered during the 
Cultural Revolution being pro-Mao? 
I mean, Stalin was abused as a child, and 
then he's incredibly abusive. Hitler was  
abused as a child. Why would you expect… 
I use the word sociopath or psychopath,  
both apply to him. Don’t think he’s going 
to have any tender mercies for anyone. 
I mean his own son is… Oh, he abandoned various 
sets of kids who starved to death and died and  
one son, he put him right up in Korea where 
he could get killed, and he promptly did, so. 
Oh and Stalin, that was another great one- the 
Nazis captured Stalin's son and wanted to trade  
him for something. Stalin said, "Nah nah nah."
How do people in China today think about  
Mao? Why aren't they more pissed off, 
you know, you look at these numbers? 
I'm guessing, I'm not Chinese, but I think all 
of us need to be proud of things. Of course,  
one thing to be very proud of if you're 
Chinese is Chinese civilization. These  
enormous achievements in philosophy, in the 
sciences, all kinds of arts, it's incredible. 
But many Chinese also want to 
feel proud of their leaders,  
and so Mao is incredibly consequential. I think 
it's also really hard to look at the dark side  
of your own country. This country has slavery; it 
is our original sin. We have not gotten over it. 
And the part of the United States where 
slavery was most deeply embedded to this  
day has the deepest problems dealing with that. 
So if Americans who are rich and have everything  
have trouble with these things, why would we 
think- and this country has so much that's  
just obvious to be proud of, the wealth and 
innovation and things, a recent innovation and  
then we claim we won all these wars all by our 
lonesome, and of course we had allies, come on. 
But I think that's part of it, is understanding 
the… Chinese history has been so sad. If you  
ever go to a Chinese movie you hear 
the erhu, whatever the instrument is,  
it's just so sad and melancholy. Whereas 
American movies are all happy. Millions  
of people die, but the good guys live, right?
It's always a happy ending, and what is it,  
in Arnold Schwarzenegger in True Lies, 
he says, "Oh honey, they were all bad.". 
I want to try out an idea on you.
You've tried many, what's the latest? 
One could claim that Mao, being so terrible 
and being this strong counterexample,  
is what the reformers needed in order to create 
China's post-Mao growth. In the sense that,  
if you were to really abandon communism 
and pursue pro-growth policies, you needed,  
viscerally, the cultural revolution as a 
counterexample, the Great Leap Forward,  
to say, "No, we've got to try something else."
Possible. Definitely possible, because of all  
the people who were ruined by it.
But I think there's another one. You  
should give the Taiwanese great credit. Taiwan 
did an after-action report. They're one of the  
four Asian tigers that went from a very poor 
country to an absolutely wealthy country. I  
think it's around 1990-ish where Taiwan 
is—I think this statistic is right, I'll  
try this—it's got 1/50th the population of the 
mainland, it's got 1/250th of the land mass of  
the mainland, and it has about 40% of the GNP.
And if you're PRC mainland looking at this,  
how embarrassing. The losers of the war 
have won the peace and put you to shame  
for how incompetently brutal you are.
And that's Taiwan's problem to this day,  
is that they are a rebuke to everything 
the Communist Party is. There used to be  
this racist notion that "Oh, Han Chinese and 
democracy, incompatible, can't do that." Well,  
China—Taiwan has proven that wrong. And look at 
Taiwan. They have, what is it, their chip foundry?  
Incredible. No one can duplicate it. Right?
Impressive. Tell me something that China  
has that can't—that no one can 
duplicate—except for crazy stuff. 
What I find disturbing about communism in 
comparison to—I mean, maybe even especially  
Chinese communism— is... when Hitler is killing 
the Jews, he doesn't make them first say,  
"Listen, you know, we were responsible for 
World War I," which he falsely claimed,  
"and we renounce our Semitic ways," or something.
And with the Cultural Revolution, with Chinese  
communism, there's a very important aspect 
where the victim must participate in their  
own victimization. They must be the one 
to say, "I'm guilty," in a way that didn't  
seem necessary in other kinds of regimes.
Oh, well, Hitler's just trying to annihilate  
people, so he didn't care what they were going 
to tell him. He's just going to kill them all.  
So that's just complete—he's into destroying 
every last Jew there is, right? Plus Gypsies  
and some other people. So that's a separate 
thing. China has a long tradition of education. 
I mean, what's Confucianism about? It's the 
scholars at the top, right? It's—in Japan,  
it's the general, the shoguns at the top. 
In China, the soldiers at the bottom of the  
social pyramid, and it's all about educating 
people. And then the entire imperial system,  
how did you get mobility? There was a way 
to mobility: take the imperial exams and  
if you pass them and do well, you're off and 
running. So, and there's also a tradition of  
re-educating people. You could shoot everybody, 
you could, but that's not the Chinese tradition. 
The loads of people dying is, a lot of it’s 
starvation. So, people like Deng Xiaoping,  
who, if you'd been in Russia, they’d just-- Stalin 
killed all the old Bolsheviks, right? There was  
no chance to come back, whereas the Chinese will 
put people in prison and try to re-educate them,  
and then you let them out afterwards. It's a 
tradition of educating people, different culture,  
different approaches to these things.
If you look at, you were mentioning  
Chiang Kai-shek's purge of the Communists, 
where he just massacred thousands of them. 
Oh yes.
Whereas- 
He’s a soldier.
Whereas other people, even other nationalists,  
wanted to accommodate the Communists more, 
especially early on, and he has one quote that  
“the Japanese are a disease of the flesh, but the 
Communists are a disease of the soul”. So, what  
was the nature of his anti-communism? Because in 
retrospect, obviously the means we don't endorse,  
but he was right about that understanding of 
what would happen with the Communists in power. 
He was interested in communism, and 
he sent his son, Chiang Ching-kuo,  
to Russia to study. Actually, his son was 
a hostage up there. He married a Russian. 
That's one of the reasons you don't have a Chiang 
dynasty because these children are not 100% Han,  
right? Because their mom's Russian. However, as 
he learned more about it, because initially he's  
interested in that, he's interested in playing 
fascism as well, and how you organize society. 
He studied in Japan, knew a great deal 
about how the Japanese had done things.  
I think he had military education there 
as well. But then he starts realizing  
how dangerous they are. He was accurate. He 
did not want to fight the Japanese at all. 
And he was forced to by Chinese students, 
among others, and a lot of the urban elite  
that he depended on, who were horrified with 
what Japan was doing. But Chiang Kai-shek knew  
you only take on one enemy at a time. You'll 
become overwhelmed if you do, and he believed  
that really he needed to kind of accommodate or 
put the Japanese aside, fight the Communists,  
get rid of them, and then he's hoping the 
United States will get in or something that  
then he could deal with the Japanese separately.
But he faced so much popular pressure that that's  
when the Xi'an incident takes place at the 
end of '36, where he agrees to form the second  
United Front. He realizes he'll be overthrown 
by popular hatred of the Japanese, thinking they  
have to fight the Japanese. So he didn't have his 
choices on military strategies at the end there. 
When you read Western journalists who are 
covering the communists in China sympathetically,  
people like Edgar Snow, and this is not just true 
of China, Walter Duranty covering up the Holodomor  
in Russia, what's going on psychologically? 
How do you understand their naivety here? 
Oh I don't know about the other guy, but I 
do know about Edgar Snow. So Edgar Snow is  
in the Depression. He's from the Midwest. He 
was a bored young man. He wants an adventure,  
so he goes off to China. This is typical.
And he's in these cities where he's seeing  
nationalist corruption, and it's evident there. 
Mao is looking for a foreign journalist. There  
had been a guy, Jack Reed, who'd written 
however many days of the Russian Revolution,  
back during the Russian revolution he’d really 
popularised it and I suspect, but I don't know,  
that Mao probably needed his own Jack Reed, 
and Edgar Snow seemed the perfect guy because  
he's a very good writer. You want someone who 
could write well, and he's young and naive. 
So what was it? Sun Yat-sen, 
the founding father of China,  
is married to one of the Soong sisters. 
Another one of the Soong sisters is married  
to Chiang Kai-shek. And there's a third one 
who's married to a banker. But anyway, it's the  
communist one who puts Mao on, I think, to Edgar 
Snow. So someone goes to Edgar and says “Hey,  
you want to come up to Yenan to interview the big 
man?” And Edgar goes, "Sure." They infiltrate him  
through Japanese lines and all the rest of it. And 
there's Mao, the busy man, who's spending hours  
with the 30-year-old, or I don't even know if he 
was 20-year-old. I can't remember how old he was. 
And Edgar Snow doesn't get it. Like, why is he 
spending all this time with me? And he's taken  
by it. And Mao's, of course, showing him all the 
good stuff, right? So Edgar Snow's seeing all the  
happy peasants who've got the land, and they're 
cooperating in the guerilla this and that. And  
he is the last person to get out of Ye’nan. And 
then the Japanese in the war just shuts it down so  
nobody's got any more information about Mao ever.
So Edgar Snow writes his book, Red Star Over  
China. He gives the drafts to Mao- 
oh yeah, he does the Mao interviews  
and then he has Mao correct them. And his 
translator corrected them back and forth,  
which isn't the normal thing. And then over 
the different editions of Red Star Over China,  
because I've actually read them and followed the 
changes, more and more of it gets eliminated. The  
original version has all kinds of pictures of 
people that Mao subsequently purges, so those  
pictures go away. All references to those people 
go away, and they're no longer in the index. 
And Edgar Snow goes along with this. And for the 
rest of his life, he is publishing books that are  
a variation on a theme on this book because 
it's the only thing that makes him important. 
Before he dies, is he discredited?
No. Mao wanted him- it was right when Nixon  
was reopening China- Mao desperately wanted Edgar 
Snow to cover that, and Edgar Snow got pancreatic  
cancer, and he was living in Switzerland. He'd 
run into trouble with the McCarthy era, as you  
can well imagine, for good reasons, actually.
And so Mao sent his personal physician to  
attend to Edgar Snow. But pancreatic cancer 
still kills, and it killed him. So, no,  
and this was even though people Edgar Snow knew 
had been purged during these various campaigns  
and also the great famine. He denied all of it 
till the very end because this is what made him  
important and so that's what he was to 
the end of his life: me, me, me, me, me. 
When you had the slogans up about what Mao is 
telling the peasants or the different slogans  
he would come up with, it's not tremendously 
sophisticated stuff. It's like one line that's  
catchy or something.
Like a tweet. 
Yeah.
Still works. 
Why was this enough? You can 
just write one line and that's- 
It's not enough. I think if you're 
talking about someone who has no power,  
the one thing they've got are words. And so this 
is how it turns out “strategic communication”,  
or whatever the jargon is for it, is 
terribly important. And we're finding it now,  
right? We're wondering on what is actually fake 
news, what's disinformation, what's accurate,  
what's not. What's deliberately inaccurate? 
Who's posting it? Where? It's powerful. 
You can see in the current election how important 
information is. Mao and the Communists play it  
well, and the Russians absolutely understand 
how to do this, this is their- they're really  
good at understanding both sides fighting, 
and then you feed information both ways so  
that they're just at each other's throats, and 
being more and more dysfunctional. Oh, yeah. 
When was the last time you were allowed 
to go into the archives in China? 
Oh, it wasn't a question of being allowed. I got 
a fellowship right- it was supposed to happen  
right after Tiananmen, and that got closed down. 
That was, Tiananmen was in June of '89. So the  
fellowship was delayed for half a year, and then 
we went for all of 1990. And so I used different  
archives, but then I did other things, like I 
had two children and I stayed at home with them. 
I was the spouse that didn't travel so that 
there would be stability in little people's  
lives. And now I would no more visit China 
you've got to be kidding. The archives have shut  
down now. And then the Russian archives it was, 
again, it was early Gorbachev when the archives  
were opening. They're slammed shut now.
It's funny to hear you say I wouldn't  
visit China now. So in two weeks, I'm 
going to go to China. My next question- 
Have fun.
-my next  
question was going to be, what is your advice?
Keep your mouth shut. Be a good guest. And  
don't bring any computer equipment that you ever 
intend to use ever again and link with anything. 
Yeah. When you're in these archives and you're 
studying all these atrocities that happen,  
if you look at the numbers themselves, 
it might be fair to call it genuinely  
the worst thing that ever happened in human 
history in terms of pure number of deaths. 
That's a hard record to match if you look at 
everything else that's happened in human history.  
Viscerally, what's the reaction just going 
through record after record of this kind of... 
Oh, it's just tragedy. It's the human condition.
And don't think that China is unique in this.  
The West has butchered itself, westerners 
have butchered each other. In fact, it's the  
West that industrializes warfare. So instead of- 
before you had to go at it with spears, and that  
slowed people down. With industrial equipment...
So it's human, sadly. Humans have great capacity  
for creativity and doing wonderful things, 
and then they have great capacity to do awful  
things. So let's do one and not the other.
That seems like a pretty good place to close.  
Sarah, this was, this was… I mean, I don’t 
want to say “fun” because we’re talking about  
Mao here. But it…
Great topic. 
It was interesting.
You want to save your reputation. 
Great, thank you.
You're welcome. Thank you for coming.
