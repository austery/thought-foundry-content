- I think when people hear about
the idea of longevity science
or longevity medicine,
their brain instantly goes
to trying to prevent death.
It's billionaires taking
100s of supplements a day
trying to stay immortal,
or people doing crazy exercise regimens
and eating bizarre diets.
It's when you eat, what
you eat, how much you eat.
And I think that this
really is a distraction
from the big goals of longevity science.
We're not talking about immortality,
this is about increasing your health span,
increasing that period of
life free from disease,
free from pain, free from memory loss.
That means that we're gonna
need longevity medicine.
And it sounds like this incredibly sci-fi,
futuristic way of making
human beings live longer.
But actually, we've already doubled
what it means to be human
in life expectancy terms
over the last 200 years.
And the economic benefits of slowing down
the aging process could be huge.
Economists have calculated
that if we were able
to slow down the aging process
and keep people healthier
for just a single year,
that would be worth $38
trillion, 38 and then 12 zeros.
By keeping people biologically younger,
we can enjoy a longer
period of healthy life
where we're active, where we're happy,
where we can engage in our hobbies,
we can play with our
grandkids, our great-grandkids.
This could be the greatest revolution
in the history of medicine.
I'm Dr. Andrew Steele.
I'm a longevity scientist,
writer, and campaigner,
and I wrote a book called
"Ageless: The New Science of Getting Older
Without Getting Old".
I actually started out as a physicist
and I actually changed
career to longevity science
because of a graph.
It's a very simple graph, it's
a graph of how old you are
versus how likely you
are to die in that year.
And it's pretty striking.
(air whooshing)
(dramatic music)
I'm 39 years old, and what that means is
that my risk of death this
year is about one in a 1,000.
That means that if that were to continue
for the rest of my life, I'd
live into my 1,030s on average.
But unfortunately, of
course, that doesn't happen.
Our risk of death as human beings doubles
about every eight years,
so that means there's
an exponential increase.
So if I'm lucky enough
to live into my 90s,
but unlucky enough that we haven't made
any advances in science or
medicine in the intervening time,
my odds of death will be about one in six.
That's life and death
at the roll of a dice.
But for other animals
around the animal kingdom,
that can look very, very different.
There are some animals,
animals like giant tortoises
or certain fish that live in the sea,
there are certain salamanders
that have a risk of death
that doesn't double.
Doesn't matter how long
ago they were born,
their risk of death stays flat.
And so, by this definition,
these animals literally do not
age, statistically speaking.
There are two ways to look at this,
you can either look at it as a human
and think this is this exponential,
terrifying wall of mortality coming at me.
Or you can look at it as a physicist
trying to find the biggest
problem in the world,
and you can think, "Well, what is this
fundamental ticking clock
inside all of our biology
that massively increases
our risk of cancer,
of heart disease, of stroke, of dementia,
of all these so-called
age-related diseases?
And if we could understand
this ticking clock,
could we do something about it?"
(dramatic music)
In the last decade,
scientists have come up
with various measures of
what's called biological age,
as distinct from chronological age.
So your chronological age is just
how many candles there
are on your birthday cake,
and obviously most of us
are familiar with that.
But the idea of biological age
is to look inside your cells,
look inside your body,
and work out how old you
are on a biological level.
Now, we aren't perfect at doing this yet
but we do have a variety
of different measures.
We can use blood tests,
we can use what are
called epigenetic tests,
or we can do things that are
far more sort of basic and functional,
how strong your grip is declines with age.
And by comparing the value
of something like your grip strength
to an average person of a given age,
we can assign you a biological age value.
And the ones that are getting
the most buzz at the moment
within the scientific community,
but also all around the internet,
are these epigenetic age tests.
So the genome is your DNA,
it's the instruction manual of life.
And the epigenome is a layer of chemistry
that sits on top of your genome.
If you think of your DNA
as that instruction manual,
then the epigenome is
the notes in the margin,
it's the little sticky notes
that have been stuck on the side,
and they tell the cell which DNA to use
at which particular time.
And we know that there are changes
to this epigenome as you get older,
and so by measuring the
changes in the epigenome
you can assign someone a biological age.
I think the problem with these tests
as applied to individuals is we don't know
enough about exactly
what they're telling us.
We don't know what
these individual changes
in epigenetic marks mean.
We know they're correlated with age,
but what we don't know is
if they're causally related.
And so what we need to
do is more experiments
where we try and work
out if we can intervene
in these epigenetic, in
these biological clocks.
Over the last 10 or 15 years,
scientists have really
started to understand
the fundamental underlying
biology of the aging process.
And they broke this down
into 12 hallmarks of aging.
One of those hallmarks is the accumulation
of senescent cells.
Now, senescent is just a
biological technical term for old.
These are cells that
accumulate in all of our bodies
as the years go by,
and scientists have
noticed that these cells
seem to drive a range of different
diseases as we get older.
And so the idea was, "What if
we could remove these cells
and leave the rest of the
cells of the body intact?
Could that slow down or
even partially reverse
the aging process?"
And scientists identified
drugs called senolytic drugs,
these are drugs that kill
those senescent cells.
And they tried them out in mice,
and they do indeed effectively
make the mice biologically younger.
Firstly, it makes them live a bit longer,
and it's a good thing
if you're slowing down
the aging process, the
basic thing you want to see.
But it's not dragging out
that period of frailty at the end of life.
They get less cancer, they
get less heart disease,
they get fewer cataracts.
And what this shows us
is that by targeting
the fundamental processes of aging,
by identifying something
like senescent cells
that drives a whole range
of age-related problems,
we can hit many perhaps
even all of those hallmarks.
One of the most exciting ideas
in longevity science at the moment
is what's called cellular reprogramming.
I sometimes describe this as a treatment
that has fallen through a
wormhole from the future.
This is the idea that we can reset
the biological clock inside of our cells,
and the idea first came
about in the mid-2000s.
There was a scientist
called Shinya Yamanaka
who was trying to find out how to turn
regular adult body cells all the way back
to the very beginning of
their biological existence,
the time when they were an embryo.
Now, he was interested in this
from the point of view
of creating stem cells,
a cell that can create any
other kind of cell in the body,
which we might be able to use
for tissue repair in future.
But scientists also noticed,
as well as turning back
the developmental clock on these cells,
it also turns back the aging clock.
Cells that are given these
four Yamanaka factors
actually are biologically younger
than cells that haven't had the treatment.
And so what scientists decided to do
is insert these Yamanaka
factor genes into mice.
Now, if you do this in a naive way
so those genes are active all the time
it's actually very bad news
for the mice, unfortunately,
because these stem cells,
although they're very powerful
in terms of what kind
of cell they can become,
they are useless at being a liver cell
or being a heart cell.
And so the mice very quickly
died of organ failure.
But if you activate these
genes only transiently,
and the way that scientists did it
the first time successfully
was essentially to
activate them at weekends.
They found that this was enough
to turn back the biological
clock in those cells,
but without turning back
the developmental clock
and turning them into these stem cells.
Now, the real challenge is this
is a gene therapy treatment,
it involves delivering
four different genes
to every single cell in your body.
And so the question is,
"Can we, with our puny
2020s biotechnology,
make this into a viable
treatment, a pill even,
that we can actually use in human beings?"
And that's what's led various
different billionaires
from the Bay Area to invest
huge, huge amounts of money in this.
Altos Labs is the biggest
so-called startup in this space.
And I wouldn't really call it a startup
'cause it's got funding of $3 billion
from, amongst the people, Jeff Bezos.
Now, I'm very excited about this
because I think $3 billion
is enough to have a good go
and see if we can turn this
into a viable human treatment.
My only concern is that epigenetics
is only one of those hallmarks of aging.
For example, resetting
the epigenetic clock
can't help with mutations in our DNA
that accumulate throughout
the course of our lives.
It also can't help with anything
that happens outside of cells.
For example, damage to the proteins
that are the scaffolding of our body,
things like collagen that make
up our skin and our bones.
And so it might be the case that we solve
aging inside our individual cells,
but we leave other parts of
the aging process intact.
(light instrumental music)
Probably the quickest short-term
wins in longevity science
are going to be repurposed existing drugs.
And the reason for this is because
we spent many, many years
developing these drugs,
we understand how they work in humans,
we understand a bit about
their safety profile,
and because these molecules already exist
we've just tried them out in mice,
in various organisms in the lab;
and found that a subset of them
do indeed slow down the aging process.
The first trial of a longevity drug
that was proposed in humans was
for a drug called metformin,
which is a pre-existing drug
that we prescribe, actually,
for diabetes in this case,
and has some indications that it might
slow down the aging process in people.
The proposal in the trial is to observe
a number of different diseases.
So we see if the people who
are taking the real metformin,
do they get cancer later?
Do they get dementia later?
Do they get less heart disease?
Do they die later than
people in the control group?
And if you follow these people
for three to five years,
that should give us enough data
to understand whether metformin
slows down the aging process.
I think one of the ones that's got
the most buzz around it at the moment
is a drug called rapamycin.
It was first isolated in bacteria
from a soil sample from Easter Island,
and it was discovered to be antifungal,
that it could stop fungal
cells from growing.
But when the scientists started
playing around in the lab,
they realized it didn't just
stop fungal cells from growing
it also stopped human cells.
The way that rapamycin works
is it targets a fundamental
central component of cellular metabolism.
It starts this process called autophagy,
which is Greek for
self-eating, "auto-phagy."
And that means it consumes
old, damaged proteins
and then recycles them
into fresh, new ones.
And in 2009 we found
out for the first time
that by giving it to mice late in life,
you could actually extend
their remaining lifespan,
they lived by 10 or 15% longer.
And this was a really incredible result,
this was the first time
a drug had been shown
to slow down aging in mammals.
And we've now tried it in
loads of different contexts,
in loads of animals and
loads of different organisms,
at loads of different times in life.
And that's fantastic news,
potentially, for us humans,
because not all of us, unfortunately,
can start taking a drug from birth
'cause most of us were
born quite a long time ago.
Because we understand a
lot about these drugs,
it means we could start doing
a human trial relatively soon.
And what I mean by that
is that we could have
the first longevity drug in
the next five or 10 years,
if we give this science
sufficient funding.
And we could imagine doing
longevity gene edits in human beings,
perhaps not in the next five years
but I think it would be foolish
to bet against it happening
in the next 20 years, for example.
And, again, that's in plenty of time
for most people watching this video.
I find it really fascinating
that I get so many ethical
questions because of this work.
If I was instead a cancer researcher
and I was telling people
we had this amazing new breakthrough
that was gonna solve childhood leukemia,
I would not get people standing
up at the end of a talk
and asking me, "Andrew,
aren't all these kids
gonna be bored with the extra
life that you've got them?
Aren't we gonna have overpopulation
because we're gonna have all
of these cancer survivors
clogging up the planet and using resources
and destroying the environment?"
And yet, when you start
talking about longevity,
suddenly all of these questions
come out of the woodwork.
It's as though we place it in
a completely separate moral,
ethical category to any
other kind of medicine.
And what I believe is longevity science
is just an extension of modern medicine.

(gentle music)
At the moment aging is the
leading cause of death globally.
Over 100,000 people die
every single day of cancer,
of Dementia, of the increased
risk of infectious disease
that comes along with growing older.
And if we can tamp down on that increase
of risk of death with time
that comes along with being a human being,
it could allow us not to just develop
treatments for individual diseases,
but drugs that can prevent
multiple different diseases
from ever arising in the first place.
But it gets shockingly little funding.
In the United States,
government funding of this kind of science
is just over $1 per American,
which is absolutely remarkable
given that you think about
aging being the cause
of cancer and dementia,
and increased infection
risk, and so on and so on.
If you add together all
those causes of death,
aging causes 85% of deaths in the U.S.
We really need a giant project
on the scale of the Human Genome Project
to understand how people age,
because there are so many different things
happening in all of our biology.
We need to measure not just your DNA
but how the expression
of your genes changes,
how your cells change, how
the proteins in your blood
and between your cells change.
We need to monitor all of these things
in order to try and feed them
into a giant computer model
and create what we'd call
a systems biology model of a human being.
There are already people
talking about the idea
that AI could cure all disease
in the next five or 10 years.
And I think the thing this really misses
is that AI is only as good as
the data that you train it on.
And I think a great example of this
is something called AlphaFold,
which is an AI that can predict
how a protein is folded
purely from its sequence.
And this was a huge
scientific breakthrough
but it was only made possible
because for decades scientists have been
measuring the structures of proteins
and depositing them in
a centralized database
called the Protein Data Bank.
Now, it's estimated that this database
would cost $21 billion to rebuild
if we were to suddenly
accidentally delete it today.
And that means it's a hugely,
hugely valuable resource,
it contains 160,000 protein structures.
And that was enough protein structure data
to train an AI that can
then predict the structure
of a protein it's never seen before.
So if we want an AI that can predict
what's going on inside of human biology,
we're gonna need to invest
a similar amount of money.
But with a $38 trillion
potential economic benefit
and actually even more than that,
if we can extend life by more than a year,
I think the payoff would
be absolutely worth it.
This is just a hugely
exciting time to be alive,
maybe for a little bit
longer than we thought.
