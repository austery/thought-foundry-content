When I was a kid, my uncle
would tell me these great stories
about his aerospace engineering career.
He used to tell me all about the machinery
and the designs that he built
throughout his life,
and always said he picked
the perfect career for himself
because of all the cool stuff
he was able to build.
Once, he told me about working
in the nose cone of an Apollo rocket,
fixing some sensitive piece of equipment
just a few days before its launch.
I was enamored by this.
Listening to his stories
had me daydreaming
about all the innovative
technology that I could build,
and it's what inspired me
to become an engineer, too.
Since going down this path,
I've learned there's more to engineering
than just the amazing stuff we build.
There's also a vital
responsibility in the work,
sometimes with the ability
to save human life.
Put simply, when engineers
mess up, people die.
And this is what my PhD
advisor warned me about
when I started working
with him four years ago.
When I decided to follow the path
of chemical engineering,
I could have never imagined
I'd be doing my PhD
in a field of study called rheology.
But rheology was interesting to me enough,
so I spent a few years
in my life understanding it.
Rheology is the study of flow
and deformation of materials.
It's mainly a method
to measure the viscosity
or thickness of a material
so that it works
for its intended function.
Rheology is best used for materials
that are neither liquid nor solid,
but some combination of both.
And the concepts of rheology
are easiest to understand
when we compare across different products,
because it is essential to almost
every consumer product on the market,
whether that's a lotion
that evenly coats your hands,
or a motor oil that lubricates
at all operating temperatures,
or cement that won't harden
before making it to the job site.
And there's so many other examples,
across many industries.
So why don't I take you over
to the rheology lab
where I can demonstrate this for you?
OK, first off, everybody
has their favorite peanut butter.
Unless you're allergic.
Maybe you prefer the one
that will stick to the bread like that.
Or you prefer the one that can't
support itself and just slides right off.
Well, it's not doing it so much,
but whatever, you know how it goes.
(Laughter)
Maybe it's a little cold in here, alright?
(Laughter)
But how about shampoo?
So the purpose of shampoo
is to squeeze from the bottle ...
and sit on your hand
so that you can sufficiently
measure out a drop that cleans your hair.
But how about when that shampoo
gets a little low?
And now you fill it up with water
so that you can save
that last little drop.
And now ...
it no longer stays
in the palm of your hand,
completely ruining
one of its core functions.
OK, now for my favorite
example, the last one,
that's ketchup.
Because there's such a huge
difference in the texture
between those popular brands.
And for this one, we'll do
a little bit of an experiment.
We have one ketchup in each beaker,
and when I flip them,
we're going to watch closely
to see which one drains faster.
Move that out of the way ...
OK, we can see there's clearly one ketchup
that's much thicker than the other.
And that happens to be
the one that's my preference.
Alright.
I need to wipe my hands off.
(Laughs)
OK.
So all of these materials
are a part of a class of materials
called non-Newtonian fluids.
And rheology is used to measure
the different flow properties
of each of these materials
so that they can be made reproducibly
and with the most desired texture
for their application.
Maybe by now you see the value
of rheology for product manufacturing.
But why should your blood
flow like ketchup?
Well, one application of rheology
that I'm most interested in
is in medical diagnostics.
You see, our blood,
it doesn't flow like water,
how you might imagine.
Rather, it flows a bit close to ketchup.
And that's because
blood is a non-Newtonian fluid,
just like all the materials
in my demonstration.
Specifically, it's a shear-thinning fluid.
And it does this because it's necessary
for healthy blood flow.
If your blood's viscosity is too high,
there's a higher chance
of developing something like a clot,
or potentially an aneurysm.
So measuring this information
would allow physicians another method
to detect for cardiovascular disease.
Yet it's not being used,
because rheology is this niche
technical engineering field,
largely unknown to the public.
But I bet everyone here can think
of at least one person in their lives
who has or had a heart condition.
Some studies show that up to 46 percent
of people over the age of 40
have some form
of coronary atherosclerosis,
which is a chronic condition
where plaque builds up in your arteries
and narrows them, reducing the flow.
One quarter of deaths in the United States
are caused by heart disease.
And one major challenge within
these diseases is to detect them early,
so that medication and treatment
have enough time to take effect.
Blood pressure is a metric
commonly used by physicians
to inform their decisions for medications
and treatment of cardiovascular disease,
and blood-pressure monitoring
has been going on for over 300 years.
Now, imagine the past 300 years,
if physicians didn't know
about blood-pressure monitoring,
there would be countless
unnecessary suffering.
This is the stage
that blood rheology is at.
Though blood's viscosity
has been studied for over 100 years,
and blood rheologists
have shown significant evidence
correlating it to cardiovascular disease,
it's still not widely used
as a diagnostic tool.
Spreading awareness
about rheology is necessary
so that it becomes known
as commonly as blood-pressure monitoring.
Blood rheology is one of those areas
where physicians can work
together with the engineers
so that we can proactively
create solutions
that put this knowledge into practice.
Some of my work as a PhD student
is to help simplify
the rheological measurement.
While I'm studying the rheology of blood
and its use for cardiovascular
disease diagnosis,
I'm also building a small
microfluidic chip.
My goal in this work is to measure
the same rheological information
in a small, cheap, portable device
that we're currently able to do
in a bulky, stationary,
half-a-million-dollar machine.
This could simplify
the rheological measurement,
making it more accessible
for many doctors.
And some physicians
have begun to use blood rheology
to augment their patient care,
and they've seen positive results so far.
But just like the blood-pressure monitor,
we'll all be better off when the public
has a greater awareness of this technology
so that we can help
improve cardiovascular disease.
And so that's why I'm asking you
to just have a conversation
with someone in your life
about this science.
And if you're in the medical community,
I want you to take a closer look
at blood rheology.
Dive into this science
and see how you might be able
to use it in your field.
There's so much valuable information
in blood rheology
that tells us about our health.
And if we can just get over its obscurity,
we might be able to help solve
some of our most pressing
modern medical issues.
If we just spread a little awareness,
we could save lives.
(Cheers and applause)
