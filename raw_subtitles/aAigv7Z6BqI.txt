>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 OddLotss
 podcast.
 I'm
 Joe
 Weisenthal


>> and
 I'm
 Tracy
 [music]
 Aloway.


>> Tracy,
 you
 know,
 future
 economy
 is


always
 uncertain.
 path
 of
 the
 path
 of


inflation,
 path
 of
 employment,
 always


big
 debates.
 I
 think
 what's
 really


interesting
 right
 now
 compared
 to
 a
 few


years
 ago
 maybe
 is
 you
 know
 at
 various


times
 it's
 like
 inflation
 is
 going
 to


come
 down
 but
 there's
 a
 fight
 over
 how


fast
 right
 and
 now
 you
 have
 a
 situation


which


>> there
 are
 people
 who
 argue
 both
 sides


some
 people's
 like
 oh
 no
 we're
 on
 a
 you


know
 we're
 heading
 down
 the
 sort
 of


yield
 data
 camp
 etc
 and
 others
 are
 like


look
 we're
 reacelerating
 it's
 going
 to


get
 hot
 again
 and
 we're
 recording
 this


February
 11th
 we
 just
 hit
 a
 fairly


strong
 jobs
 print
 etc
 and
 so
 some
 people


are
 making
 the
 reaceleration
 argument


We
 are
 so
 back
 so
 back.
 Well,
 that
 jobs


report,
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 a
 blowout
 number.


So,
 130,000
 jobs
 added
 in
 January
 versus


expectations
 for
 65,000.
 And
 even
 if
 you


drill
 down
 into
 it,
 like
 it
 looks
 pretty


good,
 right?
 But
 you're
 absolutely


right.
 So,
 we
 used
 to
 argue
 about
 how


far
 we
 would
 travel
 in
 one
 direction.


You
 know,
 inflation,


>> is
 it
 going
 to
 be
 4%,
 is
 it
 going
 to
 be


5%,
 whatever.
 And
 now
 we're
 sort
 of


arguing
 about
 which
 direction
 we're


actually
 gonna
 go.


>> Totally.
 And
 I
 think
 like
 if
 you
 just


look
 like
 okay
 one
 jobs
 report
 can't
 you


know
 take
 it
 with
 a
 grain
 of
 salt
 there


is
 there
 does
 seem
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of


evidence
 of
 some
 softening
 in
 the
 labor


market
 by
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 measures


etc.
 Housing
 market
 continues
 to
 be


fairly
 soft.
 On
 the
 other
 hand
 look
 at


various
 commodities
 you
 know
 look
 at


copper
 look
 at
 a
 bunch
 of
 other
 stuff.


Look
 at
 trucking
 prices
 freight
 picking


back
 up
 etc.
 I
 wrote
 about
 this
 in
 the


Odd
 Thoughts
 newsletter.


>> Yeah.
 There's
 uh
 lots
 of
 things
 that
 are


going
 in
 the
 other
 direction
 and
 you


would
 say,
 "Look,
 this
 looks
 like


reflation."


>> Yep.
 So,
 we
 are
 going
 to
 be
 speaking


with
 someone
 who
 had
 a
 non-consensus


call
 about
 a
 month
 ago,
 but
 again,
 I


think
 it's
 becoming
 maybe
 more
 consensus


by
 the
 day,
 by
 the
 hour
 as
 we
 get
 these


types
 of
 reports.


>> Totally.
 Well,
 we
 really
 do
 have
 the


perfect
 guest
 to
 sort
 of
 give
 us
 a


different
 take,
 a
 sort
 of
 I
 would
 say


it's
 still
 a
 little
 bit
 out
 of
 consensus


call,
 but
 um
 definitely
 um
 not
 the


direction
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 want
 to


see.
 Definitely
 not
 the
 direction
 if
 you


think
 that
 the
 Fed
 should
 cut
 rapidly


this
 year.
 Maybe
 we'll
 talk
 some
 Fed


stuff.
 We're
 going
 to
 be
 speaking,
 of


course,
 to
 Adam
 Posen.
 He
 is
 the


president
 of
 the
 Peterson
 Institute
 and


recently
 co-authored
 a
 piece
 with
 uh


Peter
 Orsag.
 Uh
 4%
 inflation.
 What?
 Uh


yeah,
 Adam,
 thanks
 for
 uh
 coming
 back


and
 joining
 us
 here
 in
 studio.
 4%


inflation.
 Really?


>> Thanks,
 Tracy.
 Thanks,
 Joe,
 for
 having


me
 back.
 Yeah,
 I
 I
 mean,
 I've
 got


friends
 who
 say
 I
 should
 have
 just
 said


3.5
 and
 that
 would
 have
 been
 enough
 out


of


Exactly.
 But
 I
 think
 it's
 realistic
 to


think
 about
 4%
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 on


headline
 CPI.
 And
 just
 going
 to
 the


spirit
 of
 what
 both
 of
 you
 were
 saying,


I
 I
 think
 the
 direction
 of
 travel
 is
 up,


not
 down
 and
 pretty
 clearly
 that
 way,


there's
 obviously,
 like
 you
 just
 said,


today's
 job
 report,
 but
 I
 think
 there's


a
 broader
 pattern.
 The
 the
 issue
 isn't,


you
 know,
 like
 you
 say,
 one
 month.
 It's


more
 about
 why
 the
 jobs
 report
 looks
 the


way
 it
 does.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at
 prime


age,
 like
 you
 Tracy
 was
 saying
 about


drilling
 down
 in
 the
 numbers,
 if
 you


look
 at
 prime
 age
 labor
 force


participation,
 which
 to
 me
 is
 one
 of
 the


most
 important
 statistics
 you
 can
 look


at,
 it's
 still
 pretty
 high.
 And
 there's


this
 risk
 of
 women
 dropping
 out
 of
 the


labor
 force
 to
 look
 after
 kids
 and


elderly
 and
 sick
 people
 if
 they
 don't


restore
 some
 of
 the
 Obamacare
 insurance


subsidies.
 And
 there
 is
 a
 conundrum
 that


if
 you're
 either
 they
 haven't
 deported


yet
 or
 managed
 to
 drive
 out
 yet
 as
 many


migrants
 as
 they
 think
 or
 you're
 losing


labor
 there
 too.
 So
 it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to


see
 this
 as
 a
 very
 weak
 job
 market.
 the


the
 kinds
 of
 things
 people
 point
 to
 like


the
 slowing
 of
 wage
 growth
 or
 the


vacancies
 over
 as
 compared
 to


unemployment


I
 think
 are
 not
 indicative
 of
 a
 demand


side
 slowdown.
 They're
 indicative
 of


what
 economists
 call
 mismatch
 meaning


less
 good
 functioning
 in
 the
 labor


market.
 So,
 just
 to
 give
 you
 two
 quick


examples,
 African-American
 unemployment


is
 up
 relative
 to
 average
 unemployment.


Historically,
 for
 both
 nasty
 and
 good


reasons,
 that's
 been
 the
 case.
 But
 it


had
 come
 way
 down.
 So,
 the
 question
 is,


is
 it
 going
 up
 because
 they're
 the


canary
 in
 the
 coal
 mine,
 or
 is
 it


because
 something
 specific
 hit


African-Ameans?
 And
 unfortunately,
 I


think
 it's
 something
 specific


contributed
 to
 African-American


unemployment,
 which
 is
 Doge
 may
 not
 have


cut
 overall
 government
 spending,
 but
 it


massively
 reallocated
 where
 our


government
 spent.
 So,
 Department
 of


Education
 gone,
 a
 lot
 of
 environmental


gone,
 a
 lot
 of
 health
 and
 human
 services


gone.
 [snorts]


>> And
 these
 are
 things
 where
 you
 had
 a
 lot


of
 government
 contractors
 that
 were


African-Americanowned


or
 run
 or
 heavily
 populated.
 And
 so
 I


think
 part
 of
 the
 reason


African-American
 unemployment
 is
 up
 and


that
 doesn't
 mean
 it's
 okay.
 It
 just


means
 it's
 not
 a
 sign
 of
 demand
 shock
 or


decline
 or
 soft
 market
 is
 because
 of


this
 hit
 to
 this
 specific
 part
 of
 the


workforce.
 Similarly,
 and
 I
 know
 you


have
 had
 episodes
 talking
 about
 this


issue,
 we
 see
 the
 phenomenon
 of
 young


people
 having
 less
 hiring,
 particularly


college
 educated
 people,
 young
 people


not
 getting
 hired
 as
 much.
 And
 I
 think


there's
 two
 things
 going
 on
 there.
 One


is
 I
 mean
 it's
 real
 again
 like
 with


African-American
 unemployment.
 I'm
 not


saying
 it's
 not
 real.
 I'm
 just
 saying


it's
 not
 telling
 you
 about
 the
 demand


situation.
 So


>> it's
 idiosyncratic
 rather
 than
 cyclical.


>> Right.
 Well
 said.
 Very
 tech
 speak.
 Um
 so


you
 know
 I
 think
 part
 of
 it
 is
 that


we've
 the
 the
 rise
 in
 you
 younger
 people


unemployment
 college
 age
 younger
 people


unemployment
 has
 been
 a
 very
 steady
 rise


for
 a
 few
 years.
 It's
 actually
 a
 a
 very


it's
 not
 like
 suddenly
 oh
 it
 got
 soft.


It's
 been
 coming
 up
 slowly
 since
 roughly


2023.
 And
 to
 me
 that
 has
 to
 do
 with
 the


hiring
 and
 rematching
 coming
 out
 of
 co


that
 people
 moved
 a
 lot
 companies
 moved


a
 lot
 of
 people
 into
 new
 jobs
 and
 and


they
 hired
 extra
 people
 in
 some
 sense


and
 so
 there's
 this
 overhang
 and
 that's


particularly
 affecting
 young
 people.
 I


mean
 AI
 is
 in
 there.
 I'm
 just
 that's
 not


thing.
 So
 anyway,
 I'm
 not
 trying
 to


cherrypick
 data,
 but
 I'm
 just
 trying
 to


say
 that


>> if
 you
 match
 that
 with
 the
 more


well-known
 data,
 the
 layoffs
 are


relatively
 low,
 the
 wage
 growth
 is


slowing,
 but
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 zero,


that
 participation
 rate
 is
 high,
 that


the
 monthly
 job
 numbers
 are
 fluctuating,


but
 on
 the
 new
 baseline
 that
 we
 all


rightly
 should
 be
 looking
 at
 solid,


I
 don't
 see
 it
 as
 a
 weakw
 week
 labor


market.


>> [music]


[music]


[music]


>> So,
 you
 just
 talked
 about
 the
 labor


side,
 but
 your
 forecast
 for
 4%
 inflation


by
 the
 end
 of
 this
 year
 is
 comprised
 of


many
 different
 things.
 So,
 walk
 us


through
 what
 exactly
 you're
 looking
 at


to
 get
 that
 that
 call.
 Thanks
 Tracy
 for


the
 opportunity
 which
 odd
 lots
 gives
 to


give
 more
 than
 two
 points.
 Um
 but
 I
 I


think
 the
 message
 is
 there
 are
 if
 I
 want


to
 start
 with
 though
 is
 there
 are
 so


many
 points
 if
 you
 kind
 of
 step
 back


right
 and
 you
 say
 all
 right
 if
 I'm


making
 a
 forecast
 for
 inflation
 over
 the


next
 year
 or
 two
 there's
 how
 soft
 or


tight
 the
 labor
 market
 is
 there's
 how


hot
 the
 econom
 is
 running
 and
 those
 two


obviously
 overlap
 there's
 are
 we
 getting


supply
 shocks
 like
 tariffs
 or


anti-migration
 policy
 there's
 what's


fiscal
 policies
 doing
 then
 there's


what's
 monetary
 policy
 doing
 and
 very


importantly,
 how
 credible
 is
 it?
 How
 is


it
 being
 transmitted?
 So,
 you
 go
 down


that
 list
 and
 there's
 to
 me
 there's
 just


an
 awful
 lot
 of
 inflationary
 stories.


So,
 tariffs,
 anti-migration
 policy,


there
 was
 a
 debate
 or
 at least
 a
 bunch


of
 people
 asserting,
 oh,
 it
 didn't


really
 matter.
 Look,
 inflation's
 not
 up


that
 much.


Well,
 my
 view,
 and
 I
 argued
 this
 in
 a


Bloomberg
 Business
 Week
 piece
 a
 few


weeks
 ago,
 is
 that
 we
 never
 should
 have


expected


the
 impact
 of
 these
 policies
 to
 be
 so


fast.
 And
 in
 fact,
 if
 you
 go
 back,
 not


that
 we
 forecast
 it
 perfectly
 by
 any


means,
 but
 if
 you
 go
 back
 to
 the
 stuff


my
 colleagues
 McKinnon
 and
 Noland
 and


others
 at
 the
 Peterson
 Institute


published
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 ago
 on
 what


would
 be
 the
 likely
 effect
 of
 the


tariffs
 or
 the
 migration
 policies,


they
 were
 building
 in
 a
 one-year
 lag


from
 when
 the
 policies
 took
 effect.
 And


so,
 you
 know,
 roughly
 next
 quarter
 is


when
 we
 should
 start
 to
 really
 see
 the


policy
 hit.
 And
 we're
 seeing
 anecdotally


in
 the
 beige
 books
 from
 the
 Fed
 in


statements
 by
 the
 Amazon
 CEO
 and
 my


co-author
 on
 part
 of
 this
 Peter
 Orzac


who
 runs
 Lazard
 has
 many
 contacts
 in
 the


business
 community
 who
 are
 talking
 about


this.
 It
 takes
 time
 to
 make
 up
 your
 mind


what
 you're
 going
 to
 do.
 Even
 if
 you're


big
 company,
 let
 alone
 if
 you're
 a
 small


company,
 it's
 very
 hard.
 So
 like,
 do
 I


get
 a
 new
 supplier?
 Do
 I
 move
 production


to
 China,
 out
 of
 China?
 Do
 I
 move
 it


into
 Mexico?
 Do
 I
 move
 it
 into
 the
 US?


Can
 I
 find
 a
 substitute?
 Do
 I
 raise


prices
 now?
 Do
 I
 wait
 till
 my


competitors
 raise
 prices?
 Can
 I
 get
 an


exemption
 from
 the
 tariffs
 if
 I
 go
 meet


with
 Howard
 Lutnik?
 You
 know,
 all
 this


stuff
 takes
 time
 to
 work
 through.
 And


the
 same
 thing
 is
 true
 for
 and
 that's


even
 before
 you
 factor
 in
 like


inventories
 of
 imported
 goods
 and


they're
 waiting
 to
 see
 whether
 Trump


actually
 sticks
 with
 the
 tariffs
 or
 not


before
 they
 make
 a
 decision.
 And
 I
 would


argue
 that
 the
 same
 is
 true
 for
 migrant


families
 or
 migrant
 workers,


undocumented
 migrant
 workers
 that
 they


have
 hard
 to
 leave
 aside
 the
 human


aspect
 which
 is
 amazingly
 horrible.
 But


just
 on
 the
 economics


they
 have
 to
 make
 up
 their
 minds.
 Is
 ICE


really
 coming
 for
 me?
 Are
 they
 coming
 to


my
 town?
 Is
 my
 employer
 going
 to
 protect


me?
 How
 long
 do
 I
 have
 before
 they
 get


here
 to
 accumulate
 dollar
 pay
 before
 I


have
 to
 leave?
 Can
 I
 hide
 and
 keep


working?
 If
 I
 go,
 do
 I
 go
 legally?
 Do
 I


take
 my
 kids
 with
 me?
 Do
 I
 not
 take
 my


do
 I
 try
 to
 come
 back?
 Again,
 these
 are


irreversible
 decisions.
 It
 takes
 time


and
 you
 want
 to
 see
 uncertainty


change
 or
 at least
 get
 settled
 before


you
 make
 the
 decision.
 So
 to
 me,
 I
 think


these
 inflationary
 pressures
 from
 the


anti-migration
 policy
 and
 tariffs
 are


already
 here,
 but
 that
 they're
 going
 to


accelerate
 in
 the
 and
 be
 more
 visible.


Then
 to
 be
 much
 quicker
 with
 the
 other


points,
 fiscal
 policy,
 I
 think
 the


Republican
 majorities
 in
 the
 Congress


and
 the
 president
 are
 going
 to
 want
 to


pass
 a
 big
 blowout
 checks
 to
 people


ahead
 of
 the
 midterm
 election.
 I
 think


they
 are
 going
 to
 pass
 some
 restoration


of
 the
 lower
 middle
 class
 subsidies
 for


Obamacare
 insurance
 because
 it's
 really


hurting
 people
 and
 it's
 really
 making


people
 angry.
 [gasps]


You
 put
 those
 two
 together,
 that's
 well


towards
 2%
 of
 GDP
 in
 additional
 deficit.


So
 say
 you
 risk
 weight
 it,
 say
 you
 put
 a


50%
 chance
 on
 the
 the
 checks
 being


handed
 out
 and
 you
 put,
 I'd
 say,
 an
 80


to
 90%
 chance
 on
 some
 amount
 of


Obamacare
 subsidies
 coming
 back.
 You
 put


in
 that
 weighted
 average,
 that
 still


gets
 you
 an
 additional
 percent
 plus
 of


GDP
 on
 the
 deficit
 that
 people
 weren't


figuring.
 Then
 you
 got
 a
 weaker
 dollar.


Then
 you've
 got
 the
 Fed.
 And
 this
 is


something
 we've
 talked
 about
 a
 few
 times


when
 you've
 been
 kind
 enough
 to
 have
 me


on.
 The
 interest
 rate
 for
 all
 Trump


talking
 constantly
 about
 it
 and


pressuring
 the
 Fed
 doesn't
 summarize


sufficiently
 the
 state
 of
 monetary


conditions
 in
 the
 economy.
 So
 you've
 got


all
 this
 private
 credit,
 you've
 got
 all


the
 AI
 investment
 being
 funded
 either


out
 of
 retained
 earnings
 or
 out
 of


issued
 bonds,
 not
 based
 on
 credit,
 um


not
 based
 on
 normal
 bank
 borrowing
 or
 or


big
 stuff.
 And
 as
 Joe
 says,
 you
 have
 a


soft
 housing
 market,
 but
 mortgage
 rates


in
 real
 terms
 have
 been
 coming
 down
 and


it's
 not
 like
 mortgage
 money
 is


unavailable.
 So
 it's
 not
 a
 tight
 credit


environment.


And
 so
 then
 finally,
 regrettably,
 we


have
 to
 take
 into
 account
 all
 the


attacks
 on
 the
 Fed
 and
 the
 changes
 at


the
 Fed.
 And
 I'm
 not
 too
 into


personalities.
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 matters


that
 much
 which
 individual,
 but
 the


structural
 forces
 on
 the
 Fed
 for
 change.


And
 you
 have
 to
 believe
 that
 makes
 the


credibility,
 the
 likelihood
 that
 they're


going
 to
 react
 in
 the
 right
 direction
 to


this
 inflation
 soon
 enough
 lower.


So,
 boom,
 boom,
 boom,
 boom,
 boom,
 boom.


>> So,
 that
 was
 a
 great
 summary
 or
 overview


of
 your
 view
 and
 there's
 uh
 plenty
 of


follow-ups
 to
 ask
 about
 that,
 but
 let's


just
 talk
 about
 the
 tariff.
 So
 I


certainly
 take
 your
 point
 that
 it
 would


take
 any
 company
 a
 while
 before
 they


decide
 their
 pricing
 strategy.


Incidentally
 not
 you
 know
 some
 companies


you
 know
 about
 almost
 a
 year
 after
 the


tariffs
 are
 going
 in
 the
 other
 direction


>> Pepsi
 for
 example
 so
 they
 cut
 prices.
 So


now
 clearly
 like
 some
 companies
 are


decided
 they
 cut
 but
 just
 on
 tariffs
 you


know
 even
 theoretically
 like
 yes
 I
 can


understand
 the
 argument
 this
 is
 a
 good


reason
 to
 raise
 prices.
 On
 the
 other


hand,
 tariffs
 are
 a
 tax
 and
 generally
 we


think
 of
 taxes
 as
 disinflationary.
 They


take
 money
 out
 of
 the
 economy.
 Here's


what
 I
 guess
 the
 question
 is
 every


company
 would
 love
 to
 be
 able
 to
 pass
 on


higher
 costs.
 Does
 there
 need
 to
 be


something
 on
 the
 demand
 side
 for
 them
 to


be
 able
 to
 because
 another
 possibility


is
 they
 just
 have
 to
 eat
 it
 in
 margins


because
 the
 consumer
 is
 not
 willing
 or


you
 know
 as
 the
 Pepsi
 consumer
 evidently


they're
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 continue
 to


pay
 high
 prices
 for
 end
 goods
 like
 are


tariffs
 per
 se
 inflationary
 or
 are
 they


only
 inflationary
 if
 there's
 sort
 of
 a


demand
 boost
 something
 for
 like
 the


checks
 or
 the
 Obamacare
 subsidies
 coming


back
 etc.
 That's
 a
 a
 really
 good
 added


layer
 of
 sophistication
 to
 this,
 Joe.


And
 you're
 absolutely
 right.
 It
 varies


from
 company
 to
 company,
 from
 industry


to
 industry.


The
 decisions
 part
 of
 the


decision-making
 process
 is
 what
 is
 the


competitive
 landscape
 and
 we
 do
 see
 I'm


proud
 to
 say
 PepsiCo
 is
 one
 of
 the
 many


corporate
 supporters
 of
 the
 Peterson


Institute.
 I'm
 a
 big
 fan
 and


>> good
 disclosure
 there.


>> No,
 no,
 I
 have
 to
 be
 honest
 and
 I'm
 I'm


proud
 to
 be
 honest.
 All
 our
 donors
 are


listed
 on
 our
 website.
 But
 anyway,


PepsiCo
 is
 arguably
 facing
 a
 lot
 of


fundamental
 trends
 in
 the
 food
 industry


and
 having
 to
 do
 with
 GLPs,
 having
 to
 do


with
 health
 perceptions
 and
 things
 that


of
 course
 are
 going
 to
 overwhelm
 for


them
 and
 they
 actually
 are
 not
 that


exposed
 to
 tariffs
 compared
 to
 some


other
 companies
 cuz
 they're
 not


importing
 sugar
 and
 they're
 not


importing
 inputs
 the
 way
 say


auto
 company
 is.
 But
 anyway,
 but
 just


that
 that
 just
 illustrates
 your
 point


that
 it
 is
 going
 to
 vary
 from
 company
 to


company.
 And
 my
 argument
 was
 just
 that


as
 a
 general
 thing
 for
 any
 given


company,
 it's
 not
 a
 trivial
 decision.


You
 don't
 just
 go.
 But
 your
 point,
 your


further
 point,
 Joe,
 that
 it's
 sort
 of


conditional
 on
 demand
 is
 absolutely


right.
 So
 there's
 two
 aspects
 to
 that.


One
 is
 just
 literally
 what
 you
 said
 that


if
 it
 turns
 out
 there's
 slack
 demand,


you
 may
 not
 see
 the
 rise
 in
 pricing
 as


much
 because


you
 just
 the
 company
 any
 given
 company


additionally
 has
 to
 decide
 you
 know
 how


much
 am
 I
 going
 to
 lose
 market
 share
 if


I
 raise
 prices.
 But
 additionally
 there


is
 an
 interactive
 effect
 that
 when
 you


are
 when
 this
 is
 why
 I
 made
 so
 much


about
 the
 labor
 market
 initially
 with


tracing
 it's
 it's
 a
 question
 of
 not
 so


much
 the
 demand
 side
 as
 your
 input
 side


right
 are
 we
 in
 a
 tight
 labor
 market
 are


we
 in
 a
 tight
 supplies
 market
 for


commodities
 do
 these
 things
 matter
 and


and
 our
 expectations
 about
 inflation


in
 the
 economy
 more
 broadly
 moving


towards
 the
 high
 side
 and
 and
 so
 again


just
 to
 come
 back
 your
 bottom
 line
 point


is
 right
 it's
 interactive
 and
 that's
 why


when
 you
 talk
 about
 inflation
 you
 want


to
 have
 all
 these
 components


>> I
 have
 to
 say
 I
 spent
 $35
 on
 three
 bags


of
 chips
 and
 two
 dips
 on
 the
 weekend
 for


the
 Super
 Bowl
 to
 be
 fair
 to
 be
 fair
 I


got
 them
 from
 a
 gas
 station
 so
 there
 was


a
 markup
 [snorts]
 but
 it
 was
 so
 worth
 it


so
 good
 Yeah,


>> I
 don't
 eat
 chips
 that
 often,
 but
 when
 I


do,


>> chips
 are
 so
 good.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 we
 had
 we
 had
 we
 had
 Fritos


scoops


>> and
 uh
 so
 those
 are
 so
 good.
 Really


thick
 Super
 Bowl
 Super
 Bowl.


>> Okay.
 Now,
 now
 we're
 just
 talking
 about


snack
 foods,
 which
 is
 fine.


>> Um,
 okay.
 What
 about
 tariffs?
 Tariff


inflation.


>> Pepsi.
 [laughter]
 Fritole.
 Pepsi.
 That's


a
 Pepsi
 product.
 Yeah,
 that's
 true.
 Just


from
 a
 math
 perspective,
 what
 you
 often


hear
 is
 that,
 well,
 you
 know,
 you
 might


have
 a
 price
 impact
 from
 tariffs,
 but
 it


doesn't
 matter
 that
 much
 because
 it's
 a


one-off
 and
 then,
 you
 know,
 the
 next


year
 the
 base
 effect
 kind
 of
 goes
 away.


But


>> does
 it
 matter
 if
 we
 get
 4%
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 year
 or
 would
 you
 expect
 this
 to


be
 a
 sort
 of
 the
 start
 of
 a
 durable


price
 increase
 cycle?
 Well,
 I
 think
 yes,


it
 it
 is
 a
 start
 of
 a
 durable,
 as
 you


put
 it,
 price
 increase
 cycle.
 And
 again,


it's
 partly
 to
 do
 with
 the
 general


conditions,
 and
 it's
 partly
 to
 do
 with


the
 nature
 of
 the
 tariffs
 and
 the
 shock.


So
 I
 think
 in
 a
 world
 where
 the
 labor


the
 labor
 market
 is
 not
 high


unemployment,
 lots
 of
 slack,
 whatever


anybody
 says.
 In
 a
 world
 where
 they
 are


going
 to
 be
 putting
 fiscal
 fuel
 on
 the


fire,
 in
 a
 world
 where
 whatever
 you


think
 about
 the
 transition
 from
 JPAL
 to


nominated
 Kevin
 Worsh
 and
 the
 attacks
 on


the
 Fed,
 you
 cannot
 believe
 that
 the


Fed's
 credibility
 of
 commitment
 to
 low


inflation
 is
 as
 strong
 as
 it
 was
 a
 few


years
 ago.
 All
 of
 those
 things
 suggest


that
 any
 given
 shock,
 any
 given
 price


shock
 will
 to
 me
 translate
 into
 higher


and
 more
 persistent
 inflation
 than
 it


would
 say
 a
 few
 years
 ago
 in
 a
 different


circumstance.


The
 second
 point
 is
 and
 and
 there's
 this


I
 forget
 what
 it's
 now
 called
 but
 there


used
 to
 be
 the
 million
 prices
 project
 at


Harvard
 Business
 School
 that's
 been


looking
 at
 the
 price
 pass
 through
 and


there
 have
 been
 others
 looking
 at
 it
 and


[clears throat]
 people
 at
 Peterson
 as


well.
 The
 the
 second
 thing
 is
 the


migration
 shock
 if
 it
 turns
 out
 they
 do


drive
 out
 a
 million
 people
 million


workers
 is
 going
 to
 have
 much
 bigger


first
 round
 effects
 than
 the
 tariff


shock.
 the
 tariff
 shock.
 I
 think


reasonable
 estimates
 are
 they've
 already


had
 1
 point
 years
 worth
 of
 CPI
 effects


roughly
 over
 the
 past
 year.
 I
 think
 if


if
 they
 really
 are
 pushing
 out
 the


migrants
 and
 we
 can
 go
 to
 why
 I
 keep


putting
 it
 conditionally
 and
 saying
 I'm


not
 sure
 they
 have
 yet,
 but
 if
 they


really
 are,
 we're
 talking
 about


something
 potentially
 four
 to
 six
 times


as
 large.
 But
 then
 the
 the
 final
 thing
 I


want
 to
 emphasize
 Tracy
 is
 on
 the
 when


you
 say
 about
 the
 durable


size
 of
 inflation


it
 is
 a
 question
 of


what
 people
 expect
 the
 monetary
 policy


response
 to
 be.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 we
 have
 a
 very
 important


lesson
 from
 the
 80s
 from
 40
 years
 ago


last
 time
 we
 had
 high
 inflation
 in
 the


US
 even
 under
 Paul
 Vulker
 they


disinflated
 in
 1982
 after
 an
 oil
 shock


but
 they
 didn't
 take
 it
 all
 the
 way
 down


they
 stopped
 when
 it
 got
 to
 around
 4%.


And
 so
 then
 when
 the
 inflation
 came
 back


in
 ' 85,


it
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 more
 persistent
 and


higher
 [gasps]


>> and
 Vulkar
 and
 the
 Fed
 had
 to
 do
 more
 to


raise
 rates.
 Most
 people
 would
 argue,
 I


mean,
 clearly
 they
 did
 raise
 rates
 more,


but
 most
 of
 us
 would
 argue
 part
 of
 the


reason
 for
 that
 was
 because
 it
 was
 the


second
 round
 of
 inflation
 and
 they


hadn't
 fully
 stomped
 it
 out
 the
 first


time.
 And
 I
 think
 you
 can
 make
 the
 case


again
 this
 is
 speculative
 but
 I
 I
 think


there's
 a
 historical
 parallel
 here.
 If


we
 get
 this
 kind
 of
 inflation
 shock
 now


coming
 it's
 five
 years
 or
 four
 years


instead
 of
 3
 years
 but
 four
 years
 after


the
 last
 inflation
 having
 again
 the


inflation
 not
 come
 all
 the
 way
 down
 to


2%
 target
 in
 this
 case
 I
 think
 the


upside
 risk
 is
 higher.
 So


>> this
 is
 interesting.
 You
 know
 when
 uh


when
 we
 were
 at
 Jackson
 Hole
 the
 last


time
 we
 saw
 you
 um
 or
 that
 we
 did
 an


episode
 with
 Emmy
 Nakamura
 and
 talking


about
 this
 idea
 of
 like
 the
 value
 of


central
 bank
 credibility
 and
 there's


like
 kind
 of
 a
 fixed
 stock
 of
 it
 or
 the


stock
 of
 credibility
 can
 deplete
 over


time
 and
 it
 might
 take
 a
 while
 to
 refill


the
 reservoir
 so
 to
 speak.
 So
 what


you're
 saying
 is
 sort
 of
 dovetales
 with


that
 which
 is
 that
 if
 you
 don't
 sort
 of


in
 fairly
 short
 order
 smash
 it
 back
 to


2%.
 that
 there
 is
 this
 sort
 of
 like


persistent
 cost
 that
 you
 might
 pay
 the


next
 time
 there's
 a
 shock


>> for
 that's
 generally
 what
 we
 see
 in
 the


data
 and
 professor
 Nakamore
 may
 have
 a


different
 take
 on
 this
 but
 but
 what
 to


my
 understanding
 of
 the
 research


including
 by
 a
 colleague
 of
 mine
 at


Peterson
 Joseph
 Gon
 on
 some
 of
 these


issues
 is
 if
 you
 fail
 to
 stomp
 it
 down


the
 anchoring
 as
 the
 phrase
 is
 of
 of


inflation
 expectations
 is
 lower
 and
 so
 a


lot
 of
 people
 focus
 on
 the
 U
 Michigan


survey
 of
 inflation
 expectations
 or
 the


New
 York
 Fed
 survey.
 Uh
 we
 had
 uh
 oh
 god


I
 can't
 remember
 her
 name
 I
 apologize


from
 Michigan
 who
 who
 runs
 that
 survey


speak
 at
 the
 Peterson
 Institute
 last


Friday.


>> There's
 a
 video
 if
 you
 want
 to
 hear
 and


and
 she
 can
 point
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 the


long-term
 inflation
 expectations
 haven't


moved
 that
 much.


My
 view
 is
 that
 only
 tells
 you
 so
 much


because
 it
 it's
 it's
 people
 have


rational
 in
 attention.
 They
 don't
 spend


their
 lives
 thinking
 about
 inflation


unless
 they
 have
 to
 spend
 their
 lives


thinking
 about
 inflation.
 And
 so
 the


question
 is
 more
 when
 inflation
 comes


how
 do
 they
 react?
 And
 so
 besides
 the


work
 of
 my
 colleague
 Joseph
 Gon
 there's


a
 professor
 at
 Berkeley
 Yuri
 Gorald


Nikenko
 and
 his
 co-authors
 who
 did
 a


really
 interesting
 paper
 last
 summer
 I


think
 ahead
 of
 Jackson
 Hall
 at
 a


different
 Fed
 conference
 showing
 that


there
 was
 this
 persistently


higher
 upside
 risk
 on
 inflation


expectations.


Since
 we're
 on
 monetary
 policy,
 you


touched
 on
 this
 earlier,
 but
 one
 of
 the


very
 interesting
 things
 in
 your
 argument


is,
 you
 know,
 you
 contend
 that
 the


transmission
 mechanism
 isn't
 quite
 what


it
 used
 to
 be,


>> possibly
 because
 of
 the
 expansion
 of


private
 debt.
 It's
 less
 linked
 to
 bank


rates,
 bank
 lending
 rates.
 talk
 more


about
 that
 because
 if
 I
 see
 an


inflationary
 environment
 and
 you
 say
 the


durability
 of
 that
 inflation
 depends
 on


what
 the
 central
 bank
 does
 in
 response


even
 if
 they
 raise
 rates


>> is
 that
 going
 to
 be
 enough
 to
 stamp
 it


out
 because
 as
 we've
 seen
 and
 we've


asked
 a
 number
 of
 central
 bankers
 this


question
 at
 this
 point
 but
 financial


conditions
 are
 still
 really
 really


>> exactly
 no
 I
 think
 you're
 absolutely


right
 and
 I
 know
 you
 recently
 did
 an


episode
 with
 former
 Fed
 vice
 chair
 Rich


Clara
 and
 when
 he
 was
 vice
 chair.
 He


tried
 to
 promote
 this
 idea
 of
 I
 think
 I


don't
 know
 if
 they
 actually
 called
 it


this
 but
 essentially
 a
 monetary


conditions
 index.
 I
 think
 it
 had
 14


pieces
 to
 it
 but
 basically
 trying
 to
 get


at
 what
 you
 just
 said
 conceptually
 that


if
 you
 in
 the
 textbook
 the
 central
 bank


has
 three
 channels
 through
 which
 it


tightens
 policy.
 One
 is
 it
 directly


affects
 the
 amount
 of
 bank
 deposits
 and


bank
 lending.
 The
 second
 is
 there
 are


repercussions
 through
 the
 yield
 curve


that
 if
 you
 move
 the
 short
 end
 of
 the


yield
 curve,
 it
 decreases
 the
 further


out
 the
 yield
 curve
 in
 duration
 you
 go.


But
 there
 is
 some
 repercussions
 along


the
 curve.
 And
 then
 the
 third
 is
 this


expectations
 channel.
 Does
 do
 people


believe
 ultimately
 that
 the
 Fed
 will
 get


things
 under
 control?


But
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 that's
 the


textbook.
 The
 working
 central
 bankers


and
 this
 overlaps
 somewhat
 with
 the


people
 who
 wrote
 the
 textbooks
 although


I'm
 not
 one
 of
 them
 but
 the
 working


central
 bankers
 going
 back
 again
 Voke


Paul
 Vulker
 are
 very
 concerned
 about


monetary
 transmission
 in
 the
 plumbing


meaning
 which
 parts
 of
 the
 financial


system
 get
 affected
 how
 much
 by
 moves
 in


interest
 rates
 or
 quantitative


tightening
 or
 regulatory
 rules
 and
 so


Vulkar
 famously
 was
 very
 upset
 when


money
 market
 mutual
 funds
 came
 into
 play


because
 the
 idea
 was
 those
 wouldn't
 be


as
 affected
 by
 Fed
 interest
 rate
 moves.


I
 think
 a
 much
 more
 serious
 issue
 right


now
 is
 the
 existence
 of
 private
 credit


where
 not
 only
 it
 exists
 but
 um
 and
 is


growing


>> and
 is
 growing
 but
 that
 we
 have
 very


little
 supervisory
 or
 regulatory


transparency
 into
 it.
 So
 the
 central


bank
 or
 anybody
 doesn't
 really
 know
 how


much
 is
 out
 there,
 where
 it's
 going,


what
 terms,
 how
 how
 shaky
 some
 of
 it


might
 be.
 [snorts]


But
 anyway,
 so
 the
 point
 is,
 think
 about


it
 again
 with
 respect
 to
 the
 housing


market.
 So
 we
 had
 a
 very
 strong
 Fed


tightening
 a
 couple
 of
 years
 ago.
 And


normally
 up
 until
 a
 couple
 of
 years
 ago,


one
 of
 the
 first
 places
 you
 would
 see


that
 would
 be
 that
 there
 would
 be


layoffs
 in
 single
 family
 and
 general


residential
 construction
 because
 these


tend
 to
 be
 small
 firms
 that
 are
 very


credit
 dependent,
 very
 both
 demand.


Their
 their
 customers
 are
 dependent
 on


mortgages
 and
 supply.
 They
 need
 credit


to
 do
 what
 they
 do.
 And
 usually
 the


first
 one
 of
 the
 very
 first
 effects
 on


the
 real
 economy
 of
 a
 Fed
 tightening


would
 be
 contraction
 in
 that
 sector.
 We


didn't
 see
 it.


>> We
 saw
 a
 very
 large
 Fed
 tightening
 and


essentially
 no
 unemployment
 rise
 in
 in


housing
 and
 not
 very
 much
 change
 in


housing
 starts.
 And
 that's
 been


replicated
 across
 a
 number
 of
 sectors,


what
 used
 to
 be
 called
 interest
 rate


sensitive
 sectors
 in
 the
 economy.
 And
 so


if
 you
 go
 back
 to
 where
 I
 started
 and


you
 say
 there
 are
 these
 multiple


channels,
 right?
 So
 two
 of
 the
 three


channels
 arguably
 are
 weaker
 than
 they


used
 to
 be.
 So
 the
 impact
 on
 the
 banking


system
 is
 less
 representative
 of
 the


impact
 on
 credit
 availability
 in
 the


economy.
 The
 impact
 on
 expectations
 for


reasons
 we
 were
 just
 talking
 about
 may


not
 be
 as
 rapid
 or
 strong.
 Again,
 the


Fed
 can
 get
 it
 back.
 Going
 to
 how
 Joe


summarized
 Emy's
 work.
 I
 [clears throat]


mean,
 you
 can
 get
 it
 back,
 but
 you


probably
 have
 to
 do
 something
 to
 get
 it


back.
 So,
 you're
 left
 with
 this
 middle


channel,
 which
 is
 the
 yield
 curve.
 And


even
 in


normal
 times
 or
 or
 less
 chaotic
 times,


there
 never
 was
 a
 lock
 step
 between
 what


happened
 at
 the
 short
 end
 of
 the
 curve


and
 what
 happens
 at
 the
 long
 end
 of
 the


curve.
 and
 Fed
 uh
 Dallas
 President
 Lori


Logan
 gave
 a
 speech
 a
 few
 weeks
 ago
 I


think
 on
 some
 of
 the
 aspects
 of
 this


where
 she's
 an
 expert
 but
 the
 bottom


line
 I
 keep
 using
 that
 phrase
 sorry
 but


the
 bottom
 line
 is
 you
 I
 you
 again


directionally
 if
 the
 Fed
 tightens
 all


three
 of
 these
 channels
 will
 have
 some


tightening
 effect
 but
 there's
 good


reason
 to
 think
 that
 none
 of
 these


effects
 will
 be
 as
 powerful
 bang
 for


your
 rate
 hike
 as
 it
 used
 to


>> [music]


[music]


[music]


>> Let's
 talk
 about
 AI
 spend.
 The
 numbers


were
 already
 going
 to
 be
 eye
 watering


for
 2026
 and
 now
 they're
 going
 to
 be


more
 eyewatering
 than
 that.
 And
 we
 got


numbers
 from
 Alphabet
 and
 Amazon
 that


were
 just
 much
 higher
 than


>> Right.
 I
 mean,
 we're
 talking
 like,
 you


know,
 this
 moves
 GDP.
 This
 is a
 GDP


altering
 numbers.
 Like,
 talk
 to
 us
 about


how
 you
 see
 the
 ripple
 out
 effects
 from


that
 spending.


>> So,
 it's
 fascinating
 and
 I
 actually


listen
 to
 you
 all
 for
 some
 of
 your


insights
 when
 you
 talk
 to
 people
 more
 in


that
 space
 than
 I
 am
 as
 a
 macroeconomist


thinking
 about
 it.
 So,
 the
 first
 point


go
 starting
 again
 with
 the
 monetary


transmission
 aspect
 is
 so
 much
 of
 this


is
 self
 finance
 or
 easily
 financed.
 So,


so
 Google's
 now
 issuing
 I
 guess
 this


hundredyear
 bond.
 Yeah,


>> I
 [snorts]
 hope
 so
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 I


hope
 everybody's
 still
 around
 in
 a
 100


years
 and
 gets
 paid
 back
 and
 that
 would


be
 nice.


>> I
 won't
 be
 I'm
 pretty
 sure.


>> Yeah.
 Well,


>> you
 know,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 British
 bond.


It's
 a
 sterling
 based
 bond
 because
 of


those
 the
 LDI
 long


>> during
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 They're
 forced


to
 hold.


>> My
 point
 is
 like
 most
 of
 it
 has
 been


cash


>> of
 course.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 my
 my
 point


was
 even
 the
 parts
 that
 are
 not
 cash


financed
 are
 being
 very
 easily
 financed.


So
 that's
 the
 first
 point
 there.
 There


is
 no
 credit
 crowding
 out
 in
 the
 rest
 of


the
 economy
 because
 of
 this.
 There
 is
 no


credit
 constraint
 on
 them
 doing
 this.


That
 has
 an
 interesting
 implication


which
 I've
 mentioned
 at
 various
 times
 in


recent
 months
 that
 makes
 it
 all
 the
 more


striking
 how
 little
 investment
 we're


getting
 from
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 economy.
 I


mean,
 so
 if
 you
 think
 about
 sort
 of
 the


litany
 of
 reasons
 that
 a
 Trump


administration
 official
 Xanti
 could
 give


for
 why
 there
 should
 be
 investment
 boom


beyond
 AI,
 right?
 We've
 made
 permanent


the
 tax
 cuts
 that
 are
 favorable
 to


corporate
 investment.
 We
 are


deregulating.
 We
 are
 doing
 things
 to


make
 the
 labor
 market
 more
 friendly
 to


employers.
 We've
 got
 cheaper
 energy


prices
 until
 AI
 pushes
 up
 some
 of
 that.


But
 broadly
 speaking,
 we
 got
 cheaper


domestic
 energy
 supply
 and
 we
 got
 a
 Fed


that
 until
 recently
 looked
 like
 it
 was


cutting
 rates.
 So
 beyond
 AI,
 there


should
 have
 been
 an
 investment
 boom.
 And


my
 view
 is
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 Trump


administration's
 creation
 of
 massive


uncertainty,
 including
 through
 the


tariffs
 and
 the
 anti-migration
 policy,


but
 in
 other
 fields
 as
 well,
 is
 why
 you


don't
 have
 an
 investment
 boom
 outside
 of


AI.
 It's
 not
 because
 of
 tight
 credit.


Um,
 and
 people
 should
 be
 taking
 that


more
 seriously.
 Again,
 that
 doesn't


change
 what
 you
 just
 said,
 Joe.
 It's
 eye


watering
 what
 AI
 does.
 That
 doesn't
 mean


the
 total
 GDP
 has
 to
 contract,


>> but
 I
 think
 people
 should
 notice
 the


fact
 that
 we
 haven't
 had
 an
 investment


boom.
 My
 colleague
 Karen
 Dynet
 Peterson


presented
 on
 some
 of
 this
 in
 her


forecast
 in
 October.
 We
 haven't
 had
 the


investment
 boom
 outside
 of
 AI.
 Then
 the


big
 ticket,
 there
 are
 a
 number
 of
 things


we
 can
 think
 about,
 but
 the
 big
 ticket


issue
 which
 some
 Fed
 officials
 and
 Trump


officials
 have
 been
 talking
 about
 is


productivity
 growth.


How
 much
 does
 this
 generate
 productivity


growth?
 How
 soon?
 How
 job
 displacing
 is


it?
 What's
 the
 effect
 on
 inflation?
 So,


let
 me
 give
 you
 my
 take.
 My
 view
 is


we're
 in
 the
 process
 of
 the
 baton
 sort


of
 being
 handed
 in
 the
 in
 the
 imagine
 a


summer
 Olympics
 a
 relay
 race
 and
 the
 one


runner
 hands
 the
 baton.
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


the
 labor
 market
 changes
 that
 took
 place


during
 and
 after
 co
 nobody
 knew
 they


would
 be
 ex
 anti
 but
 expost
 they
 turned


out
 to
 be
 pro
 productivity
 growth.
 there


was
 a
 lot
 of
 good
 reallocation
 of


workers
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 running
 out


because
 that
 was
 a
 one-off
 thing
 and
 so


now
 the
 AI
 is
 the
 ma
 is
 increasingly
 the


main
 source
 of
 the
 productivity
 growth


but
 I
 also
 think
 going
 back
 to
 something


you
 were
 saying
 earlier
 about
 the


tariffs
 when
 you
 have
 a
 supply
 shock


positive
 or
 negative
 it
 it's
 it's


indeterminate


how
 much
 of
 that
 shows
 up
 in
 prices


versus
 real
 things.
 So,
 like
 we've
 had


this
 discussion
 about
 tariffs.
 Could
 it


be
 a
 one-off?


>> Could
 it
 be
 recessionary
 from
 the


tariffs
 and
 therefore
 not
 price


inflationary?
 We
 can
 go
 into
 why
 I
 don't


think
 that's
 right,
 but
 you
 have
 to
 do


the
 same
 process
 thinking
 about


productivity
 growth.
 It's
 a
 positive


supply
 shock,
 but
 how
 much
 of
 it
 shows


up
 as
 real
 income
 gains
 and
 how
 much
 of


it
 shows
 up
 as
 disinflation
 has
 to
 be


determined.


And
 my
 reading
 of
 the
 history
 is
 when


you
 get
 a
 leap
 forward
 in
 a
 general


purpose
 technology,


you
 get
 the
 real
 income
 gains
 upfront


and
 you
 get
 the
 disinflationary
 part


later
 because
 I
 mean
 not
 all
 the
 real


income
 gains
 but
 it's
 primarily
 real


income
 gains
 initially
 because
 what


happens
 again
 going
 back
 to
 stuff
 we


were
 talking
 about
 it
 takes
 businesses
 a


while
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 do
 I
 use
 this


technology
 ology,
 how
 do
 I
 change
 my


production
 process?
 How
 do
 I
 change
 my


hiring
 and
 training
 process?
 What
 are


the
 new
 products
 I
 can
 offer?
 But


there's
 cool
 products
 that
 people
 want


and
 use
 right
 away.
 So,
 if
 you
 think


about
 the
 internet
 in
 the
 '90s
 when
 Solo


famously
 said,
 "The
 computers
 are


everywhere
 but
 in
 the
 statistics."
 Well,


you
 know,
 a
 bunch
 of
 us
 were
 starting
 to


use
 computers,
 getting
 productivity


gains,
 but
 it
 took
 several
 years
 before


Walmart
 and
 UPS
 and
 science
 firms


figured
 out
 how
 to
 make
 use
 of
 this
 and


to
 change
 their
 processes.
 So,
 sorry
 to


be
 so
 long-winded,
 but
 I
 think
 this
 is


overlaps
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 that
 you


hear
 at
 OddLots
 talk
 about
 with
 with


some
 of
 your
 some
 of
 your
 other
 guests.


These
 are
 non-trivial
 business


decisions,
 non-trivial
 investment


decisions.
 And
 so
 if
 I'm
 sitting
 at
 the


Fed,
 yes,
 in
 theory,
 I
 don't
 know


whether
 tariffs
 are
 going
 to
 be
 mostly


recessionary
 or
 mostly
 inflationary
 for


the
 reasons
 I've
 we've
 discussed.
 I


think
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 mostly


inflationary
 starting
 now
 and
 less


recessionary.


If
 you're
 talking
 about
 AI,
 I
 think
 if


I'm
 a
 if
 I
 were
 a
 central
 banker
 again


and
 I
 had
 to
 make
 a
 call
 or
 I
 am
 making


a
 forecast
 call
 now,
 I
 think
 you're


going
 to
 see
 the
 real
 income
 effects
 in


the
 next
 couple
 years
 predominantly
 and


not
 so
 much
 the
 disinflationary
 effects.


Then
 they're
 coming.
 They're
 coming,
 but


they're
 not
 there
 yet.


>> Can
 we
 go
 back
 to
 the
 transmission


mechanism
 and
 the
 yield
 curve
 for
 a


second?
 Because
 one
 of the
 reasons
 we


wanted
 to
 talk
 to
 you,
 it's
 not
 just


because
 of
 the
 report,
 but
 also
 because


you're
 a
 former
 central
 banker,
 used
 to


be
 with
 the
 Bank
 of
 England,
 the


monetary
 policy
 committee
 over
 there.


There
 is
 talk
 at
 the
 moment
 of
 a
 new


Treasury
 accord


>> and
 Wars
 has
 kind
 of
 signaled
 some


interest
 in
 this.
 So
 that
 would


basically
 be
 tying
 the
 Fed's
 balance


sheet
 to
 Treasury
 financing
 in
 some
 way,


coordinating
 presumably
 to,
 you
 know,


lower
 short-term
 rates
 and
 allow
 the


Treasury
 to
 issue
 more
 bills
 and
 thereby


lower
 the
 deficit.


>> Is
 that
 a
 good
 idea?


>> No.


>> Okay.
 [laughter]


Explain.


>> Yeah.
 So
 during
 the
 Euro
 crisis
 when
 I


was
 at
 Bank
 of
 England,
 I
 gave
 a
 speech


that
 central
 bank
 independence
 is
 about


the
 power
 to
 say
 no.
 But
 you
 didn't
 have


to
 always
 say
 no,
 right?
 So
 you
 don't


want
 to
 be
 I
 made
 the
 analogy
 a
 teenager


or
 a
 toddler,
 but
 I
 think
 I
 use


teenager.
 You
 know,
 you
 you
 don't
 assert


your
 independence
 by
 no
 matter
 what
 your


parent
 says
 to
 you
 disagreeing.
 So
 the


idea
 that
 there
 should
 be
 some


coordination
 between
 Treasury
 and
 Fed
 or


between
 the
 central
 bank
 and
 the
 finance


ministry
 is
 not
 unreasonable.
 But
 the


idea
 that
 there
 should
 be
 an
 ongoing


accord
 as
 opposed
 to
 say
 an
 emergency


response
 during
 the
 financial
 crisis
 or


during
 COVID
 is
 what's
 scary.
 And
 it's


scary
 because
 if
 you
 go
 back
 to
 the
 work


on
 central
 bank
 independence,
 there's
 a


huge
 amount
 of
 data
 analysis
 on
 this
 and


historical
 records
 and
 I
 was
 one
 of the


many
 contributors
 to
 that
 literature.


Turns
 out
 there
 are
 two
 things
 that


predict
 whether
 a
 central
 bank
 is


inflationary
 or
 not.
 it.
 Yeah.
 And
 one


is
 does
 the
 governor
 or
 the
 chair
 get


fired
 and
 replaced
 a
 lot
 out
 of
 turn
 out


of
 the
 normal
 sequence?
 And
 the
 other
 is


does
 the
 central
 bank
 buy
 bonds
 pretty


directly
 from
 the
 Treasury.


>> And
 [snorts]
 there's
 whole
 lists
 of
 all


these
 other
 aspects
 of
 central
 bank


independence
 about
 voting
 rules
 and


transparency
 and
 those
 don't
 have
 any


predictive
 power.
 But
 those
 two
 things,


do
 you
 do
 you
 directly
 buy
 government


bonds
 and
 do
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 turnover


at
 the
 top
 leadership


[snorts]
 do
 predict
 higher
 inflation
 and


we
 saw
 this
 on
 the
 leadership
 side
 in


with
 Erdogan
 and
 Turkey
 and
 Modi
 in


India
 in
 recent
 years
 where
 they
 forced


rapid
 turnover.


>> How
 many
 central
 bank
 heads
 did
 Turkey


actually
 go
 through?
 Does
 anyone
 know?


was
 four
 or
 five
 I
 think
 in
 India's
 case


it
 was
 like
 three
 and
 again
 in
 in
 very


short
 spans
 of
 time


>> so
 you
 know
 the
 idea
 that
 we
 have
 an


orderly
 transition
 from
 PAL
 to
 war
 at


the
 end
 of
 Pal's
 term
 as
 chair
 I
 mean


that's
 not
 what
 we're
 talking
 about
 but


I
 think
 it
 is
 important
 to
 contextualize


the
 the
 things
 that
 Treasury
 Secretary


Bent
 and
 the
 administration
 are
 talking


about
 visa
 v
 the
 Fed
 are
 things
 that


historically
 over
 time
 in
 other


countries
 have
 produced
 high
 inflation


So
 I
 mean
 I
 can
 make
 it
 more
 complicated


than
 that
 but
 just
 full
 stop.
 But
 so


then
 there
 comes
 the
 question
 of
 how


much
 can
 you
 fix
 a
 fiscal
 problem


through
 short-term
 debt
 management
 and


financial
 engineering,


>> right?


>> And
 the
 answer
 is
 you
 can't.
 So


generally


you
 and
 and
 this
 goes
 to
 stuff
 that
 both


Wars
 and
 Bent
 complained
 about
 in
 public


going
 into
 the
 elections
 in
 2024
 which


was
 they
 complained
 that
 the
 Yellen


Treasury
 was


>> financing
 this
 Treasury
 issuance.
 Yeah.


And
 then
 they
 they
 still
 kept
 issuing


lots
 of
 bills.
 They
 did
 the
 same
 thing.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 I
 beyond
 pointing
 out
 the


hypocrisy,
 which
 I
 guess
 is
 part
 for
 the


course,
 I
 think
 they
 had
 more
 validity


with
 what
 they
 were
 saying
 before
 than


what
 they're
 saying
 now.
 And
 and
 again,


it's
 not
 a
 good
 sign
 about
 the
 fiscal


sustainability
 of
 the
 US
 if
 what
 you're


trying
 to
 do
 is,
 you
 know,
 get
 the
 loan


with
 the
 free
 toaster
 to
 to
 bridge
 over


your
 monthly
 credit
 card
 bill.
 There
 is


risk
 to
 doing
 more
 short-term
 issuance.


So,
 I
 mean,
 it's
 worth
 thinking
 back
 a


few
 years
 ago,
 right,
 when
 rates
 were


incredibly
 low
 and
 the
 Treasury
 started


considering
 issuing
 100-year
 bonds
 or


very
 long-term
 bonds
 or
 at least


increasing
 the
 issuance
 of
 30
 years


versus
 short
 bills
 to
 fund


infrastructure
 to
 fund
 long-term


investment.
 And
 there
 was
 push
 back
 from


something
 called
 the
 Treasury
 Borrower


Advisory
 Committee,
 uh,
 TBAC.
 Exactly.


And
 the
 Treasury
 Secretary
 at
 the
 time,


I
 think
 it
 was
 Jack
 Lou,
 said,
 "Okay,


we're
 not
 going
 to
 do
 it."
 And
 the
 push


back
 was
 twofold.
 First
 the
 general


principle
 that
 the
 US
 government
 should


be


issuing
 across
 the
 range
 of
 maturities


on
 a
 very
 deliberate
 basis
 to
 continue


to
 maintain
 tre
 the
 US
 Treasury's


international
 and
 national
 role
 as
 the


most
 liquid
 most
 deep
 most
 stable
 asset


in
 the
 world
 and
 that
 if
 you
 start


gaming
 it
 for
 short-term
 advantage
 you


lose
 that
 and
 that
 will
 show
 up
 in


higher
 borrowing
 costs
 because
 then
 the


number
 of
 people
 who
 park
 in
 treasuries


because
 it's
 the
 domestic
 and
 foreign


because
 it's
 the
 safe
 stable
 asset
 goes


down
 because
 it's
 less
 safe
 and
 less


stable.
 But
 then
 there
 was
 also
 the
 the


rationale
 that
 you


don't
 know
 what's
 going
 to
 happen.
 I


mean,
 look
 at
 the
 fluctuations
 we
 had


from
 surplus
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 90s
 to


rising
 interest
 rates
 in
 the
 early
 2000s


to
 incredibly
 low
 interest
 rates
 for
 a


decade
 after
 the
 financial
 crisis
 to
 now


rising.
 You
 know,
 this
 is
 not


smart
 if
 you
 can
 borrow
 long
 to
 borrow


short.


>> We
 are
 recording
 this
 on
 jobs
 day
 of


course
 the
 new
 jobs
 day
 which
 is


Wednesdays
 Wednesday.


>> Yeah.
 February.
 My
 mind
 is
 blown.


>> No,
 I
 don't
 like
 it.
 I
 don't
 like
 it.


>> Yeah,
 it
 feels
 weird.
 But
 we
 just
 got


some
 truth
 social
 posts
 out
 of
 Trump


saying,
 "These
 are
 great
 job
 numbers,


much
 better
 than
 expected.
 America


should
 therefore
 be
 paying
 the
 lowest


interest
 rate."


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 see
 views
 uh
 rates
 as
 like
 a


reward,
 a
 reward
 for
 good
 work.
 We
 could


go
 on.
 I
 have
 so
 many
 questions.
 go
 on
 a


long
 time,
 but
 I
 wanted
 to
 sort
 of
 get


your
 take
 on
 especially
 like
 around


Davos,
 some
 of
 the
 tensions
 around


Greenland
 and
 Europe
 and
 all
 that.
 And


it
 occurs
 to
 me
 like
 one
 of
 the
 themes


of
 this
 conversation
 particularly
 as
 it


relates
 to
 tariffs
 and
 also
 immigration


is
 that
 people
 don't
 make
 up
 their
 minds


at
 once,
 right?
 Corporate
 leaders
 don't


just
 say,
 "Okay,
 tariffs
 are
 up."


Because
 these
 are
 big
 decisions


>> and
 and
 they're
 uncertain.
 You
 don't


know
 if
 Trump's
 going
 to
 give
 it
 away
 or


not.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 right.
 There's
 a
 huge
 lag


and
 then
 once
 you
 make
 the
 decision,


that's
 like
 big
 stakes.
 And
 I've
 been


thinking
 about
 this
 like
 in
 the
 context


of
 Europe
 because
 obviously
 Europe
 still


has
 this
 very
 tight
 economic
 and


security
 relationship
 with
 the
 United


States
 and
 the
 European
 leaders
 kind
 of


have
 to
 make
 a
 bet
 which
 is


>> is
 Trump
 the
 new
 normal
 here
 in
 the


United
 States
 or
 will
 the
 next
 president


uh
 have
 a
 adopt
 a
 posture
 an
 economic


and
 security
 posture
 that's
 sort
 of
 like


the
 old
 presidents
 and
 no
 one
 no
 one


really
 knows
 for
 sure
 but
 this
 is
 like
 a


high
 consequence
 choice
 to
 make
 because


if
 the
 next
 president
 is
 going
 to
 be


sort
 of
 a
 more,
 you
 know,
 more
 normie
 on


this
 stuff,
 then
 maybe,
 you
 know
 what,


you
 just
 sort
 of
 grin
 and
 bear
 it
 for


the
 next
 few
 years.
 And
 then,
 or
 at
 some


point,
 if
 the
 relationship
 is
 going
 to


be
 dramatically
 changed,
 Europe
 really


needs
 to
 rethink
 like
 how
 much
 it
 spends


on
 military
 and
 maybe
 rethink
 about,
 oh,


do
 we
 want
 a
 closer
 orientation
 with


China,
 whatever
 it
 is.
 And
 uh
 there's
 a


big
 decision
 to
 make.
 So,
 I'm
 curious


like
 your
 take
 like
 European
 leaders


right
 now,
 they
 haven't
 pulled
 the
 rip


cord
 yet
 on
 the
 United
 States.
 There's
 a


lot
 of
 frustration,
 but
 they
 haven't.
 We


had
 we
 still
 have
 this
 tight


relationship.
 Is
 it
 are
 we
 getting


closer
 to
 where
 European
 leaders
 might


think
 look


>> this
 is
 never
 going
 to
 go
 back
 maybe


sort
 of
 the
 carney
 speech
 is
 like
 we're


never
 going
 to
 go
 back
 to
 the
 old


relationship
 with
 the
 United
 States.


We're
 in
 a
 new
 world.


>> It
 is
 the
 great
 big
 picture
 question
 Joe


and
 I
 have
 been
 writing
 on
 this
 and


talking
 with
 European
 leaders
 on
 this.
 I


published
 a
 piece
 in
 foreign
 affairs


in
 September
 called
 the
 new
 economic


geography
 in
 which
 I
 talked
 about
 if
 I


argued
 that
 this
 is
 a
 fundamental


lasting
 change


>> because
 the
 US
 is
 ceasing
 to
 be
 the


insurance
 provider
 in
 both
 security
 and


economic
 terms
 that
 it
 was
 and
 that


I
 think
 it's
 very
 fair
 to
 say
 and


realistic
 whatever
 happens
 in
 terms
 of


successor
 to
 the
 current
 administration,


even
 if
 the


successor
 administration,
 whether
 it's


another
 Republican,
 a
 Democrat,
 some


kind
 of
 new
 party
 centrist,
 whatever
 it


is,
 is
 not
 going
 to
 immediately
 credibly


reverse
 everything
 that's
 been
 said
 and


done.
 [clears throat]


>> And
 so
 it's
 analogous,
 the
 parallel
 you


you
 were
 giving,
 I
 think
 is
 right.
 And


[clears throat]
 there's
 a
 fundamental


economic
 theory
 by
 Dixon
 and
 Pindik


called
 um
 about
 investment
 that


investment
 under
 uncertainty
 you
 delay


because
 in
 a
 sense
 it's
 irreversible


once
 you
 once
 once
 something
 happens
 and


you
 commit
 down
 a
 certain
 path.
 It's
 not


literally
 irreversible
 but
 it
 it
 it


locks
 you
 in.
 It's
 not
 just
 sunk
 cost


fallacy.
 It's
 rational.
 So
 going
 from


the
 abstract
 to
 the
 real,
 we're
 we're


coming
 up
 on
 the
 new
 Munich
 Security


Conference,
 annual
 Munich
 Security


Conference.
 And
 in
 March
 2024,


Vice
 President
 JD
 Vance
 gave
 a
 speech


there
 and
 the
 preceding
 week
 in
 Paris
 in


which
 he
 basically


>> March
 2025.


>> 2025,
 sorry.
 Right.
 We're
 in
 2026.


You're
 absolutely
 right.
 March
 2025.
 in


which
 he
 basically
 said,
 you
 know,
 NATO,


Ukraine,
 but
 NATO
 cannot
 count
 on
 us
 the


way
 they
 used
 to.
 And
 he
 gave
 arguments


for
 why
 why
 that
 was
 good
 for
 NATO
 and


good
 for
 the
 US
 and
 all
 that.
 We
 can


debate
 that,
 but
 the
 it
 was
 a
 very


shocking
 big
 shift.
 And
 then
 as
 you


mentioned,
 Prime
 Minister
 Carney,
 now


the
 most
 famous
 ex-
 central
 banker
 in


the
 world,
 um


gave
 a
 speech
 in
 Davos
 a
 few
 weeks
 ago


which
 was
 very
 much
 about
 the
 trying
 to


say
 for
 Canada,
 it
 was
 a
 general
 loss
 of


this
 framework
 that
 we've
 all
 functioned


in.
 And
 interestingly,
 almost
 exactly
 a


year
 ago,
 I
 was
 in
 Ottawa
 brought
 in
 by


the
 Canadian
 government
 to
 brief
 them
 on


the
 likely
 implications
 of
 the
 Trump.
 It


was
 right
 before
 the
 election
 where


Carney
 moved
 from
 appointed
 to
 ongoing


prime
 minister.
 But
 anyway,
 at
 that


time,
 I
 I
 you
 know,
 I
 was
 dealing
 with


absolutely
 shocked
 Canadians


and
 like
 you
 said,
 right?
 So,
 the
 first


time
 during
 Trump's
 one,
 people
 said


discounting
 the
 adults
 are
 in
 the
 room.


Maybe
 it'll
 change.
 Under
 Biden,
 things


did
 change,
 but
 on
 tariffs
 and
 a
 lot
 of


things,
 it
 had
 been
 a
 one-way
 ratchet.


They
 didn't
 go
 back.


>> They
 were
 upset
 about
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 IRA


stuff.


>> Absolutely.
 And
 it
 was
 unilateral
 and
 I


think
 shortsighted,
 but
 anyway.
 And
 the


Biden
 team
 did
 a
 lot
 of
 bad,
 continued
 a


lot
 of
 bad
 things
 and
 did
 a
 lot
 of
 bad


things.
 They
 weren't
 as
 hostile
 on
 the


security
 front.
 They
 were


transatlanticist
 there,
 but
 on
 the


economic
 front,
 they
 didn't
 really
 roll


back.
 And
 in
 some
 ways
 they
 made
 worse


some
 of
 what
 Trump
 won
 in.
 And
 so
 by
 the


time
 you
 get
 to
 a
 year
 ago,
 which
 is


even
 before
 Vance's
 Munich
 speech,
 the


Canadians
 are
 saying
 to
 themselves,
 "Oh


my
 god,
 we
 this
 is
 a
 perfect
 example.
 We


we
 we
 just
 realized
 we
 have
 no
 internet


pipes
 that
 don't
 run
 through
 the
 US.
 We


either
 have
 US
 satellites
 or
 we
 have
 US


cables.
 We
 literally
 have
 no
 access
 to


the
 internet
 without
 the
 US
 permission."


And
 that
 encapsulates
 what's
 going
 on,


right?
 that
 you
 took
 for
 granted
 that
 if


you
 were
 not
 Russia
 or
 Iran,
 the
 US


would
 not
 weaponize
 things
 against
 you


and
 that's
 no
 longer
 a
 feasible
 thing.


So
 going
 specifically
 to
 Europe,
 this
 is


the
 biggest
 challenge
 to
 Europe
 since


the
 war.
 This
 is
 a
 situation
 where
 a
 lot


of
 European
 officials,


very
 much
 in
 line
 with
 your


characterization,
 Joe,
 a
 year
 ago,
 we're


still
 in
 denial
 or
 we're
 still
 having
 a


lot
 of
 conversations
 with
 people
 like
 me


about
 is
 this
 going
 to
 last?
 Can
 we
 wait


it
 out?
 Is
 this
 going
 to
 turn
 around?
 At


this
 point,
 nobody
 believes
 it's
 going


to
 turn
 around,
 or
 at least
 nobody


believes
 it's
 going
 to
 turn
 around


sufficiently
 and
 last
 in
 a
 way
 that
 the


Europeans
 can
 count
 on
 whoever's
 next


the
 same
 way
 they
 took
 for
 granted.
 Now,


the
 Trump
 people
 would
 say
 that's
 good.


They're
 not
 taking
 us
 for
 granted.
 But


from
 an
 economic
 point
 of
 view
 that
 it


was
 a
 good
 thing
 that
 large
 parts
 of
 the


world
 could
 take
 the
 US
 enforcing
 the


rules
 of
 the
 game,
 providing
 some
 basic


security
 of
 navigating
 the
 seas
 and


property
 rights
 and
 trade
 relations
 and


access
 in
 and
 out
 of
 treasuries,
 access


in
 and
 out
 of
 US
 markets.
 That
 we
 took


all
 that
 for
 granted
 was
 a
 huge
 boon
 to


business.
 It
 was
 a
 huge
 boon
 to


investment.
 It
 was
 a
 huge
 boon
 to


two-way
 trade.


So
 this
 is
 a
 very
 big
 deal
 and
 so
 a


number
 of
 people
 in
 Europe
 are
 involved


in
 various
 projects
 trying
 to
 come
 up


with
 what's
 next
 and
 two
 colleagues
 of


mine
 at
 Peterson
 are
 very
 active.


Olivier
 Blanchard
 the
 famous
 French


economist
 who's
 now
 back
 in
 France
 is


leading
 an
 effort
 on
 what
 future
 for


Europe.
 My
 colleague
 Jacob
 Kirkagard


who's
 based
 in
 Brussels
 does
 a
 lot
 of


work
 on
 how
 much
 common
 European
 funding


is
 going
 into
 the
 military
 and
 how


sustainable
 is
 that.


The
 big
 thing,
 one
 of the
 things
 Jacob


points
 out
 is
 you
 do
 have
 a
 split
 in


Europe,
 not
 so
 much
 about
 how
 much
 they


distrust
 Trump
 or
 distrust
 the
 US,
 lost


faith
 in
 the
 US,
 but
 over
 how
 imminent


they
 see
 the
 military
 threat
 from
 say


Putin.


So
 the
 amount
 of
 spending
 that
 these


countries
 are
 doing
 on
 military
 is
 a


declining
 function
 of
 how
 close
 they
 are


to
 Russia.


I
 mean
 you
 can
 literally
 do
 the
 scatter


plot.
 Poland
 and
 the
 Baltics
 and
 Swedes


and
 the
 Norwegians.
 Nor
 Norway
 is
 not


part
 of
 Europe.
 It's
 part
 of
 NAO
 anyway


are
 spending
 a
 lot
 more.
 Germany's
 in


the
 middle.
 Spain
 and
 Portugal
 are
 not


spending.
 But
 you're
 back
 in
 a
 world
 of


that
 kind
 of
 re
 geo
 and
 geopolitics


really
 mattering.
 And
 the
 final
 thing
 I


would
 say
 in
 this
 because
 we're
 coming


up
 on
 the
 Munich
 Security
 Conference
 is


ahead
 of
 this
 there
 was
 an
 announcement


of
 a
 new
 idea
 backed
 by
 merits
 in


Germany
 and
 Mcronone
 in
 France
 of
 sort


of
 a
 leadership
 committee
 in
 Europe


moving
 ahead.
 So
 it
 would
 be
 Germany,


France,
 Poland,
 Spain,
 Italy,
 basically


the
 big
 countries
 plus
 Netherlands.


And
 that
 was
 a
 nogo


for
 decades
 in
 Europe


that
 that
 things
 had
 to
 be
 done
 by


involving
 everybody.
 Things
 had
 to
 be


done
 by
 qualified
 majority
 or
 unonymity.


And
 this
 is
 a
 statement
 problems
 are


moving
 too
 fast.
 We
 have
 to
 stand
 up.


And
 so
 my
 view,
 which
 is
 ultimately
 more


optimistic
 than
 a
 lot
 of
 Europeans,
 is


that
 what
 Europe
 chooses
 to
 do,
 they


have
 a
 lot
 of
 agency.
 They
 will
 have
 a


lot
 to
 determine
 the
 outcome
 of
 how
 bad


things
 go
 for
 them
 and
 for
 the
 rest
 of


the
 world
 as
 Trump
 and
 she
 end
 up


pursuing
 similar
 bad
 economic
 policies.


H


>> I
 mean
 it
 is
 very
 telling
 about
 our


current
 moment
 in
 time
 that
 we're


talking
 about
 the
 Munich
 Security


Conference
 as
 like
 a
 macroeconomic


indicator
 at
 all.
 Right.
 Absolutely


right.


>> Used
 to
 be
 just
 for
 foreign
 policy


wonks.


>> Exactly.
 Now
 it's
 for
 econ
 wonks
 as


well.
 Yeah.


>> That's
 right.
 Also,
 why
 are
 they
 holding


it
 on
 Valentine's
 Day
 weekend?


>> Oh,
 no.
 They
 do
 all
 these
 things.
 It's


like
 it's
 like
 the
 ECB
 Centra
 conference


is
 always
 on
 July
 4th
 weekend.
 It's
 just


they
 ostentatiously
 don't
 watch
 the


Hallmark
 channel.
 It's
 just
 no
 good.


>> Adam
 Posen,
 thank
 you.
 That
 was


fantastic.
 That
 was
 a
 great


conversation.
 We
 could
 ask
 you
 so
 much


more,
 but
 really
 appreciate
 you
 uh


coming
 on
 OddLots
 again.


>> Really
 glad
 to
 be
 with
 you
 both
 on


OddLots.
 Keep
 up
 the
 good
 work
 and
 thank


you
 for
 having
 me.


>> All
 right,
 take
 care.
 [music]


>> Thanks
 so
 much,
 Adam.


>> [music]


>> Tracy,
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 a
 great


conversation.
 Your
 point
 there
 at
 the


end
 dovetailed
 with
 something
 else
 he


said
 about
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 link
 now


between
 security
 and
 macro.
 I
 was


thinking
 about
 that
 observation.
 We


should
 definitely
 do
 more
 on
 this.
 You


know,
 Canada
 not
 having
 access
 to
 the


internet
 unless
 it's
 through
 the
 US.
 So,


how
 do
 you
 solve
 that?
 Well,
 like
 you


spend
 and
 you
 build
 new
 pipes,
 you
 build


new
 undersea
 cables,
 you
 build
 more


satellites,
 but
 that's
 spending,
 right?


That's
 inflationary.
 Yeah.
 And
 so,
 you


know,
 again,
 it's
 the
 same
 thing
 with,


we
 talked
 about
 it
 with
 Jeff
 Curry.


Europe
 spending
 trillions
 on
 defense.


These
 concerns
 about
 whether
 the
 degree


to
 which
 countries
 can
 rely
 on
 the
 US


anymore.
 The
 way
 you
 address
 these


concerns
 is
 a
 lot
 more
 spending.


>> Absolutely.
 To
 me,
 we
 are
 seeing
 some


inflationary
 signs,
 right?
 like
 we


talked
 about
 them
 at
 the
 beginning
 and


you
 can't
 really
 ignore
 them.
 I
 guess


the
 the
 big
 question
 is
 how
 much
 of
 this


is
 like
 a
 temporary
 like
 blip
 in
 terms


of
 building
 back
 inventories.
 you
 know,


maybe
 people
 ran
 them
 down
 all
 last
 year


because
 they
 didn't
 know
 exactly
 what


was
 going
 to
 happen
 with
 tariffs,
 but


now
 now
 they
 really
 have
 to
 stock
 back


up
 and
 so
 you're
 getting
 this
 like


onetime


inflationary
 hike
 or
 is
 this
 the
 start


of
 something
 that's
 kind
 of
 I
 know
 we


keep
 using
 the
 word
 durable.


>> No,
 but
 it
 is
 the
 right
 qu
 Yeah,


totally.


>> And
 like
 if
 you
 look
 at
 something
 like


trucking
 rates
 and
 again
 like
 we're


interested
 in
 trucking
 rates.
 We
 did
 a


lot
 of
 episodes
 on
 it,
 but
 also
 they're


just
 a
 good
 macroeconomic
 indicator.


>> We've
 seen
 some
 glimmers
 of
 a
 recovery


there.
 So
 freight
 rates
 are
 starting
 to


go
 up,
 but
 everyone's
 kind
 of
 saying,


well,
 we
 need
 to
 see
 like
 6
 weeks
 of


sustained
 improvement.
 So
 I
 think
 that's


kind
 of
 like
 the
 question
 right
 now,


February
 11th,
 do
 we
 get
 more
 sustained


inflationary
 indicators
 over
 the
 next


month
 or
 two?


>> Absolutely.
 And
 um
 you
 know
 again
 I
 you


know
 it's
 interesting
 even
 if
 we
 had
 had


this
 conversation
 say
 a
 month
 ago
 or


something
 like
 that
 when
 you
 know
 it


looked
 like
 maybe
 there
 was
 more
 you


know
 the
 the
 the
 story
 of
 job
 market


softening
 was
 less
 unambiguous
 or


something
 like
 that.
 You
 think
 about
 the


new
 Fed
 chair
 it's
 like
 okay
 do
 we
 need


rate
 cuts
 right
 away
 it's
 like
 ah
 25


basis
 points
 50
 basis
 point
 maybe
 they


could
 be
 a
 little
 lower.
 It's
 not
 the


end
 of
 the
 world
 if
 there
 is
 a


reaceleration.
 If
 we
 actually
 are
 seeing


gathering
 steam
 again


>> and
 the
 incoming
 Fed
 chair
 still
 has


this
 impulse
 that
 like
 you
 have
 to
 like


cut
 rates,
 you
 have
 to
 establish.
 I
 mean


Trump
 joked,
 but
 not
 really
 a
 joke.
 He's


like,
 "Oh,
 I'd
 sue
 if
 Kevin
 Worsh


doesn't
 cut
 rates."


>> If
 you
 have
 this
 sort
 of
 rate
 cuts
 into


a
 period
 of
 we're
 actually
 seeing


acceleration
 that's
 like
 a
 very


different
 story
 and
 very
 Yeah.
 put
 more


fuel
 on
 the
 fire.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of
 sort
 of


interesting
 risks
 out
 there.


>> Yeah.
 People
 were
 kind
 of
 ambivalent


about
 a
 rate
 cut
 even
 when
 the
 labor


market
 was
 softening.
 Yeah,
 exactly.


>> And
 then
 if
 you
 say
 you're
 going
 to
 cut


rates
 when
 it's
 reacelerating,
 well,


>> we
 could
 go
 on.


>> Should
 we
 leave
 it
 there?


>> Let's
 leave
 it
