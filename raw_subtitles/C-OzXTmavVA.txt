[Speaker 0]: 零二零二零二零二零零零零零零二零一一 gy。
[Speaker 1]:  then i want to move onto our new topic today。
[Speaker 1]:  john uxsia，
[Speaker 1]:  i don't know if youve seen anything about john uxsia recently，
[Speaker 1]:  john yoksia has ignited a gossip monger war on twitter。
[Speaker 1]:  i don't know if you've been following it no，
[Speaker 1]:  because in early january，
[Speaker 1]:  several bloggers such as dau pan，
[Speaker 1]:  jinkey had already posted a video claiming the john yuki had actually seized power and forced president sheet to hide in a bunker。
[Speaker 1]:  we'll look at his title later。
[Speaker 1]:  i was bored。
[Speaker 1]:  so i wrote some code to scrape all the video titles from these bloggers。
[Speaker 1]:  the number of these videos is primarily based on those with john yuxsia。
[Speaker 1]:  in the title，
[Speaker 1]:  dau pen，
[Speaker 1]:  jinkey has one hundred seventy two videos discussing john yuxi，
[Speaker 1]:  a dushi je has one hundred fifty four。
[Speaker 1]:  i don't know if you know doshi jw，
[Speaker 1]:  what kind a group is doshi IO affiliated with。
[Speaker 2]:  it seems to be related to fall on gone。
[Speaker 2]:  because when i opened his profile，
[Speaker 2]:  there was a link to a clean world website。
[Speaker 2]:  as soon as i saw that i knew it might be related。
[Speaker 1]:  oh，
[Speaker 1]:  i see sound of hope has eleven seventy seven videos louding，
[Speaker 2]:  a famous gossid monger，
[Speaker 2]:  also has eleven seventy seven。
[Speaker 2]:  john phone has ninety eight videos across two channels。
[Speaker 2]:  you should be familiar with john fone，
[Speaker 2]:  right？
[Speaker 2]:  he's also from your group。
[Speaker 1]:  newin dynasty has ninety four episodes professor john tinlyang has eighty six videos ten jiun has five eight seven。
[Speaker 1]:  KAIUUUUAN has forty three simmacu u has twenty four fying way has one hundred，
[Speaker 1]:  sixty seven and luu。
[Speaker 1]:  shshja has twelelwhat what wenjaw wenjaw actually quite rererained。
[Speaker 1]:  i checked ked，
[Speaker 1]:  he only only four four vides in total。
[Speaker 1]:  so i didn't include him in the ranking because the numbers too small，
[Speaker 1]:  then you can see why dau pan jinky is ranked first。
[Speaker 1]:  look at this video。
[Speaker 1]:  he posted two weeks ago。
[Speaker 0]: 嗯，
[Speaker 1]:  look at the title nine political bureau，
[Speaker 1]:  members demand。
[Speaker 1]:  she jumpmping's resignation。
[Speaker 1]:  john uxsia takes the lead in criticizing overseas leaks，
[Speaker 1]:  and when job bout meets with political bureau members，
[Speaker 1]:  this so called incredibly influential figures，
[Speaker 1]:  wife fe has become the keto controrol shshe，
[Speaker 1]:  which means that john uxsia and his group have already taken control of the situation 啊。
[Speaker 1]:  this was posted two weeks ago。
[Speaker 1]:  okay。
[Speaker 1]:  then look at these titles，
[Speaker 1]:  these are iconic titles。
[Speaker 1]:  these topics about john yuxi are found in their videos。
[Speaker 1]:  you can see that basically all the videos about john yuxi on youtube were just fabricated nonsense jojohn uxica slams，
[Speaker 1]:  the US military。
[Speaker 1]:  the US militaries contingency plan involves john uxsia。
[Speaker 1]:  oh my god。
[Speaker 1]:  yes。
[Speaker 1]:  the US militaries ingency plan involves johhyuxya，
[Speaker 3]:  and there's also a video where ten genu n says the pungi UN has been placed under house arrest。
[Speaker 1]:  wow，
[Speaker 1]:  the CC pe's rare earth card is about to fail，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  this also has something to do with john e'k。
[Speaker 1]:  see a not ky SUUUUAN。
[Speaker 1]:  it's kyshine。
[Speaker 1]:  i'm just making it joke。
[Speaker 2]:  to be honest。
[Speaker 2]:  i actually know john yukia，
[Speaker 2]:  or i've heard the name john yukia from these old guys，
[Speaker 2]:  twitter and youtube accounts before that，
[Speaker 2]:  i had never heard of such a person。
[Speaker 2]:  then i started seeing so many posts about john yuxa，
[Speaker 2]:  john yuxia，
[Speaker 2]:  john yuxa，
[Speaker 2]:  who is this person？
[Speaker 2]:  and then i gradually learned about him。
[Speaker 1]:  i saw on twitter that the chairman wan john often posts the john yuxia led troops to surround the hospital。
[Speaker 1]:  and then the civil war started again。
[Speaker 1]:  that's how i learned about john nuxia。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  that's about right。
[Speaker 1]:  i also hadn't heard of this john nuxia before。
[Speaker 1]:  and then these overseas bloggers basically educated me about him。
[Speaker 1]:  look at these bloggers titles involving john yuxia。
[Speaker 1]:  what is this？
[Speaker 1]:  john yxxy is already taking a lead sharply criticizing。
[Speaker 1]:  she。
[Speaker 1]:  this rain master says that the air force commander is suspected of attempting to assasinate john uxia，
[Speaker 1]:  but failed and lost his own life，
[Speaker 1]:  also draggthe air force into the perch storm。
[Speaker 1]:  she jumping and john are fighting for power，
[Speaker 1]:  a life and death struggle。
[Speaker 1]:  it's a back and fourth battle。
[Speaker 1]:  this was posted on december thirteen for thirty one six。
[Speaker 1]:  voice of hope posted。
[Speaker 1]:  the china will be completely gone by twenty twenty six。
[Speaker 1]:  the US military，
[Speaker 1]:  an amazing contingency plan involves john uxia，
[Speaker 1]:  and they say she jumping attempted to assasinate。
[Speaker 1]:  john yxsea three times，
[Speaker 2]:  oh，
[Speaker 2]:  my god，
[Speaker 2]:  an internal CCP military report about attacking taiwan，
[Speaker 2]:  an has been exposed。
[Speaker 2]:  well，
[Speaker 2]:  i'd really like to see how they planned to attack taiwan。
[Speaker 2]:  an look，
[Speaker 2]:  it was john funteacher。
[Speaker 2]:  john ffong said that she jmping has already retreated his underground bunker。
[Speaker 2]:  er no way out。
[Speaker 2]:  this was on january ary third，
[Speaker 1]:  john ussee sslam the table and angry rereked him for not staying in his place。
[Speaker 1]:  i guess he was listening nearby，
[Speaker 3]:  then a formal military officer revealed a four ten dinsey television reported that a former military ary icer rerevealed，
[Speaker 3]:  the fory military，
[Speaker 3]:  and john min would step down。
[Speaker 3]:  and john，
[Speaker 3]:  you see see would take over a chairman man of the central military commission。
[Speaker 1]:  you jojohn，
[Speaker 1]:  you sesee six six，
[Speaker 1]:  here's older than she jumping，
[Speaker 1]:  right question。
[Speaker 1]:  mark john tinley，
[Speaker 1]:  ie said she jmping is very afraid of john uxia jojohn tin leie said john yuxia seize power from she jmping fourteen generals were perged，
[Speaker 1]:  and john uxous faction was also perged ten jie，
[Speaker 2]:  said hung leu n was under house arrest。
[Speaker 2]:  this is already going overboard。
[Speaker 2]:  no，
[Speaker 2]:  i just want to know who is watching these videos。
[Speaker 2]:  don't undetimate these videos。
[Speaker 2]:  don't view councounts very high，
[Speaker 2]:  very high view counts。
[Speaker 2]:  faanway said john yuxsia controls the entire army，
[Speaker 2]:  and the eighty second army surrounded the seven hotel faingway teacher。
[Speaker 2]:  thing way，
[Speaker 2]:  october，
[Speaker 2]:  twenty third。
[Speaker 2]:  i really want to ask，
[Speaker 2]:  why would anyone watch these？
[Speaker 2]:  i can understand that many people want she jumping to fail，
[Speaker 2]:  but the wolf cried wolf story。
[Speaker 2]:  you can believe it once or twice。
[Speaker 2]:  but after the third time，
[Speaker 2]:  nobody believes it anymore，
[Speaker 2]:  we've heard this three hundred times already，
[Speaker 2]:  how can people still believe it？
[Speaker 1]:  but you have to understand。
[Speaker 1]:  first of all，
[Speaker 1]:  many of these titles are in traditional chinese characters。
[Speaker 1]:  the audience might not necessarily be mainland chinese viewers。
[Speaker 2]:  i know no matter who the audience is，
[Speaker 2]:  it's the wolf cried wolf story。
[Speaker 2]:  usually when people are missled like this，
[Speaker 2]:  they might feel good immediately after watching。
[Speaker 2]:  but after a day or two，
[Speaker 2]:  they'll definitely realize its fate。
[Speaker 2]:  no，
[Speaker 2]:  no，
[Speaker 2]:  no，
[Speaker 2]:  no，
[Speaker 2]:  look at that failed listening video。
[Speaker 2]:  OI think was kycoono or someone else。
[Speaker 2]:  he failed to get any insider information today。
[Speaker 2]:  and then he posted a video saying that he got a letter ridten by john yuxia before his arrest from some top secret place，
[Speaker 2]:  then he read it。
[Speaker 2]:  and the comments below said，
[Speaker 2]:  oh，
[Speaker 2]:  regardless of whether this letter is real or not。
[Speaker 2]:  i don't think this is about john yuxia being arrested。
[Speaker 2]:  quote，
[Speaker 2]:  they said something about john yuxia leading troops to arrest。
[Speaker 2]:  she jumping she jumping has been arrested hundreted of times already。
[Speaker 2]:  so wouldn't realize that they've been food。
[Speaker 2]:  i really want to list them list them all out。
[Speaker 1]:  maybe what he said is true every time it's like a storytelling performance，
[Speaker 1]:  and actually，
[Speaker 1]:  the main audience should be from taiwan。
[Speaker 1]:  look at these top ten。
[Speaker 1]:  the top ten people，
[Speaker 1]:  i think ninety percent of them use traditional chinese characters only louding maintains the use of simplified chinese characters，
[Speaker 1]:  loudn specifically attracts the chinese audience，
[Speaker 1]:  but others like john funshchinn rn，
[Speaker 1]:  and john tinleiang are all targeting taianese users。
[Speaker 1]:  the funniest thing is loui e，
[Speaker 1]:  you johhn IN doctor，
[Speaker 1]:  john tinlyan。
[Speaker 1]:  is he a doctor？
[Speaker 1]:  just understand it this way？
[Speaker 1]:  it's a kind of fan fiction。
[Speaker 1]:  that's all okay。
[Speaker 1]:  do you know what he said？
[Speaker 1]:  john an's tittles，
[Speaker 1]:  very，
[Speaker 1]:  very interesting。
[Speaker 1]:  seventy percent of his titles related to john u。
[Speaker 1]:  xi，
[Speaker 1]:  r，
[Speaker 1]:  intraditional，
[Speaker 1]:  chinese characters，
[Speaker 1]:  and thirty percent are in simplified chinese characters。
[Speaker 1]:  this is very interesting。
[Speaker 1]:  this is the only one among all the bloggers who does this，
[Speaker 1]:  which means he forgot some switchly input methods and typed some simplified chinese characters。
[Speaker 1]:  it's also possible that he was doing an AB test。
[Speaker 1]:  so you see using these titles。
[Speaker 1]:  if you look at this series of titles，
[Speaker 1]:  you will piece together a story in your mind。
[Speaker 1]:  basically，
[Speaker 1]:  the stories foundation was laid in june。
[Speaker 3]:  at that time，
[Speaker 3]:  president lelee was deducing。
[Speaker 3]:  the four conditions for john yusi to launch a couu discussing the theoretical possibility of this veteran general seizing power by ototoa，
[Speaker 1]:  twenty twenty five，
[Speaker 3]:  the bunpower smell ququickly intenfified anan。
[Speaker 3]:  when broke the news that the eighty second army surrounded the jime and and ma cu in chinran began to publicly discuss whether john uki had already replaced。
[Speaker 3]:  she jjmpan had taken control of the entire army，
[Speaker 3]:  and there were even rumors that she jgmping appoint ted，
[Speaker 3]:  john uuxi to succeed him as chairman of the central military commission。
[Speaker 1]:  the power struggle entered a fiars ce hohods ds arard stage khhwanin inted out at a fierce infiting between john uki and yawa erupted within the military high commman，
[Speaker 1]:  leading to a large scale per of the army in late december。
[Speaker 3]:  the conflict went public ten genuine，
[Speaker 3]:  describe the shocking scene。
[Speaker 3]:  john uta openly insulting shi jmping during a promotion ceremony and claimed the pongin UN was already under travel restrictions。
[Speaker 3]:  john fn，
[Speaker 3]:  scribe johni is the most chaodescine of infighting to picting various facctions of wealth individuals，
[Speaker 3]:  gaining on the emperors，
[Speaker 3]:  refering to pong UN，
[Speaker 3]:  forcing shshe jymping to ite a letter resignation，
[Speaker 1]:  but msterstratetegifururrevealed a dramatic plot involving a former air force commander who lost his life，
[Speaker 3]:  an unsuccessful assassination attempt。
[Speaker 3]:  john niusia，
[Speaker 3]:  by the beginning of month th unfolding drama reached its peak。
[Speaker 3]:  john funclaed，
[Speaker 3]:  the john y to angry slamm the table，
[Speaker 3]:  demanding the cheejumping，
[Speaker 3]:  a ide by the rules，
[Speaker 3]:  forcing sheet hide in a bunker。
[Speaker 3]:  loud angry be will even more astishshing ininformation tion laiming the cheegen ing plepleted with john uto a three times，
[Speaker 3]:  and the two sides entea life and death trouble for neutral aniolaation。
[Speaker 3]:  john tinley，
[Speaker 3]:  an can hope the fufuture delaare e。
[Speaker 3]:  john uci had seizpower and US military，
[Speaker 3]:  even prepares surprising contingency plan to deal with the collapse of the CCP contacting john usia。
[Speaker 3]:  finally，
[Speaker 3]:  on january eleven，
[Speaker 3]:  a climaticcene unfolded as nine polyeuro members jointly demanded cheegmpp's resignation，
[Speaker 0]:  led by john nuxya。
[Speaker 3]:  at this moment in the narratives of these watders，
[Speaker 3]:  john xy completed dramatic transformation from a low profile veteran general to a powerful commander and then a vambar against ejymping。
[Speaker 3]:  of course，
[Speaker 3]:  we added the ending to the story，
[Speaker 3]:  which is on january，
[Speaker 3]:  twenty second or twenty fourjohn n uxy was officially taken down。
[Speaker 3]:  that's the end of this fan fiction。
[Speaker 3]:  actually，
[Speaker 1]:  i think this mentality is quite easy to understand if we like a historical figure，
[Speaker 1]:  we really enjoy reading fan fiction about them right，
[Speaker 1]:  even if much it a fabricated，
[Speaker 1]:  if still like to read it。
[Speaker 1]:  if we really just like a historical figgure，
[Speaker 1]:  we like to ad ad fan iction that portrays them negatively。
[Speaker 1]:  if you like to read fan fiction about them，
[Speaker 1]:  there's a market for it right like to on humanchi ananchchchangjen transmigraating to the main dynasty。
[Speaker 3]:  and becoming empperr chonjen。
[Speaker 3]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  that's fan fiction，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  i have to say something about president lew。
[Speaker 1]:  although the number of videos he made involving john youki is only twelve。
[Speaker 1]:  he was the first person on twitter to predict john，
[Speaker 1]:  you should es arrest essentially becoming famous overnight。
[Speaker 1]:  if you look at president lose videos。
[Speaker 1]:  now the comments below all say，
[Speaker 1]:  old lew became famous overnight。
[Speaker 1]:  so you know that president lew actually has some skills，
[Speaker 1]:  but some people say that president lew and kai UUU ann are like two sides of the same coin when it comes to predicting things。
[Speaker 1]:  some people guess that john yxi，
[Speaker 1]:  a seizzed power and another group guesses that john yuxi was arrested。
[Speaker 1]:  someone is bound to guess correctly，
[Speaker 1]:  so isn't that risky？
[Speaker 1]:  this is definitely not the case。
[Speaker 1]:  president luin kai UUU ann are definitely two different people now president lois famous in the province and on twitter。
[Speaker 1]:  he's basically being praised for becoming famous overnight。
[Speaker 1]:  okay，
[Speaker 1]:  they said，
[Speaker 1]:  i'm drinking black tea again，
[Speaker 1]:  because i often mistake kyshhn for ky YUKUAN。
[Speaker 1]:  when i'm on twitter，
[Speaker 1]:  i said，
[Speaker 1]:  why is ki YU qun spreading rumors？
[Speaker 1]:  again，
[Speaker 1]:  i was indeed mistaken。
[Speaker 1]:  i also thought it was kai UU un before，
[Speaker 1]:  right。
[Speaker 1]:  i also saw someone say that it was law rn，
[Speaker 1]:  who said it？
[Speaker 1]:  first，
[Speaker 1]:  i don't know about that。
[Speaker 1]:  so that's the main content of our discussion today。
[Speaker 1]:  law e。
[Speaker 1]:  did you send me your pd f，
