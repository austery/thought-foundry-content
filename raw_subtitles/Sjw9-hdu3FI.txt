From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Michael


Bubaro.
 This
 is
 the
 daily.


On
 Tuesday,
 prosecutors
 investigating


the
 death
 of
 Rob
 and
 Michelle
 Reiner


said
 they
 plan
 to
 charge
 the
 couple's


son,
 Nick,
 with
 firstdegree
 murder.


today.
 Julia
 Jacobs
 on
 what
 we're


learning
 about
 the
 death
 of
 a
 Hollywood


legend
 and
 Wesley
 Morris
 on
 why
 so
 many


of
 Reiner's
 films
 are
 among
 the
 most


beloved
 movies
 ever
 made.


It's
 Wednesday,
 December
 17th.


Julie,
 I
 appreciate
 you
 coming
 in
 today.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> I
 just
 want
 to
 say
 at
 the
 outset,


perhaps
 this
 is
 obvious,
 but
 the
 death


of
 Rob
 Reiner
 and
 his
 wife
 Michelle
 is
 a


very
 gruesome
 and
 tragic
 situation
 and


we
 do
 not
 want
 to
 linger
 on
 it
 for
 a


long
 time
 in
 this
 conversation.
 In
 fact,


I
 hope
 we
 don't
 have
 to
 linger
 on
 it


much
 at
 all.
 But
 I
 do
 think
 we
 should


briefly
 talk
 about
 what
 we
 know
 at
 this


point
 about
 what
 actually
 happened.


>> You're
 right.
 It's
 an
 absolute
 tragedy


and
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 questions
 right


now.
 But
 what
 we
 do
 know
 is
 that
 on


Sunday
 evening,
 the
 authorities
 were


called
 to
 Rob
 Reiner's
 home
 in


Brentwood,
 a
 neighborhood
 in
 Los


Angeles.
 And
 the
 first
 information
 that


came
 out
 was
 that
 there
 were
 two


deceased
 individuals
 inside.
 And
 they


listed
 the
 ages,
 but
 not
 initially
 the


identities.
 But
 the
 ages
 matched
 up


roughly
 with
 those
 of
 Rob
 Reiner,
 the


Hollywood
 director,
 and
 his
 wife,


Michelle
 Singer
 Reiner,
 who
 is
 a


photographer
 and
 a
 producer.


And
 later
 that
 night
 on
 Sunday
 night,


their
 son
 Nick
 was
 arrested
 and


eventually
 police
 said
 they
 were


investigating
 his
 role
 in
 their
 deaths.


>> Right.
 Which
 was
 a
 shocking
 piece
 of


information.
 Yes.
 And
 then
 on
 Tuesday,


prosecutors
 announced
 that
 they
 intended


to
 charge
 Nick
 Reiner
 with
 two
 counts
 of


first-degree
 murder.


>> Right.
 Making
 very
 official
 this


genuinely
 horrible
 scenario
 in
 which
 a


child
 had
 killed
 both
 of
 his
 parents.


>> Correct.
 And
 the
 son,
 Nick
 Reiner,
 had
 a


long
 documented
 history
 of
 drug


addiction.
 And
 you
 know,
 that
 story
 had


been
 out
 there
 for
 years.
 He
 had


struggled
 since
 he
 was
 a
 teenager.
 He


had
 been
 in
 and
 out
 of
 rehab.
 He
 had


gone
 through
 bouts
 of
 homelessness
 when


he
 didn't
 want
 to
 be
 in
 the
 rehab
 that


his
 parents
 wanted
 him
 to
 be
 in.
 But
 he


eventually
 made
 his
 way
 back
 home
 and


started
 living
 in
 his
 parents'
 guest


house.


>> And
 what
 I'm
 told
 is
 they
 had
 a
 very


tight-knit,
 warm
 household.
 They
 spent
 a


lot
 of
 time
 together.
 And
 in
 fact,
 on


Saturday
 night,
 some
 of
 my
 colleagues


were
 told
 that
 Rob
 Reiner
 and
 Nick


Reiner
 were
 at
 the
 house
 of
 Conan


O'Brien
 for
 a
 Christmas
 party.


>> Um,


>> the
 night
 before,


>> the
 night
 before.
 And
 that,
 you
 know,


one
 person
 told
 my
 colleague
 that
 Rob


Reiner
 said
 something
 about
 his
 son's


behavior,
 something
 to
 the
 effect
 of,


"You
 can't
 act
 this
 way."


>> And
 this
 was
 the
 night
 before
 Rob
 and


his
 wife
 Michelle
 were
 found
 stabbed
 to


death
 allegedly
 by
 Nick.
 And
 what
 we
 all


had
 to
 reckon
 with
 thereafter
 was
 that


this
 huge
 force
 in
 Hollywood,
 this


enormously
 successful
 and
 influential


director
 and
 producer
 who
 himself
 had


quite
 famously
 escaped
 the
 shadow
 of
 his


own
 father,
 had
 allegedly,
 as
 you
 said,


been
 killed
 by
 his
 own
 son.
 And
 I
 wonder


if
 you
 can
 tell
 us
 that
 story
 of
 Reiner


and
 how
 he
 became
 what
 he
 became.


>> So
 after
 the
 news
 of
 Rob
 Reiner's
 tragic


death,
 everyone
 automatically
 started


reliving
 his
 career.
 And
 something
 that


he
 talked
 about
 a
 lot
 is
 his
 father,


Paul
 Reiner.
 He
 was
 a
 giant
 of
 20th


century
 television.
 and
 he
 helped
 define


the
 medium
 of
 television
 comedy.
 He
 was


a
 performer,
 a
 writer,
 director.
 He


created
 the
 Dick
 Van
 Dyke
 Show,
 one
 of


the
 most
 celebrated
 comedies
 of
 all


time.
 He
 won
 nine
 Emmys
 and
 and
 directed


many
 movies.
 He
 worked
 as
 a
 close


collaborator
 with
 Steve
 Martin.
 And


throughout
 Rob's
 long
 career
 in


Hollywood,
 he
 could
 actually
 be
 quite


candid
 about
 how
 overwhelming
 it
 could


be
 to
 live
 in
 the
 shadow
 of
 his
 father.


How
 did
 he
 talk
 about
 it?


>> He
 talked
 about
 feeling
 misunderstood
 as


a
 child
 once
 he
 was
 quoted
 as
 saying
 it


was
 frightening
 to
 be
 compared
 to
 him.


And
 he
 tells
 this
 story
 about
 how
 a


friend
 of
 his
 father
 Norman
 Lear,


another
 giant
 of
 television,
 pointed
 out


to
 Carl
 Reiner
 that,
 you
 know,
 his
 son


Rob
 was
 quite
 funny.
 But
 Carl
 Reiner
 was


surprised
 like
 my
 son
 funny.
 I
 think


he's
 quite
 quiet
 and
 sullen.
 And
 in


Rob's
 later
 years,
 he
 would
 tell
 that


story
 a
 lot
 as
 an
 example
 of
 how
 he
 just


felt
 like
 his
 father
 didn't
 get
 him,


>> didn't
 know
 him,


>> right?
 But
 he
 wanted
 to
 be
 like
 his


father,
 just
 like
 his
 father.
 And
 he


didn't
 shy
 away
 from
 that
 either.
 He


told
 another
 story
 that
 when
 his
 father


at
 one
 point
 encouraged
 him
 to


differentiate
 himself,
 he
 suggested,
 you


know,
 what
 other
 name
 would
 you
 want
 to


take
 on?
 what
 would
 you
 want
 to
 change


your
 name
 to?


>> And
 Rob
 said,
 "What
 if
 I
 changed
 it
 to


Carl?"


>> And
 so
 he
 embraced
 this
 desire
 to
 be


like
 his
 father.
 He
 was
 a
 teenager
 on


the
 set
 of
 the
 Dick
 Van
 Dyke
 show,


learning
 everything
 he
 could
 about


entertainment.
 And
 you
 know,
 eventually


he
 got
 into
 theater.
 He
 struck
 out
 on


his
 own.
 And
 his
 first
 major
 television


role,
 he
 was
 cast
 by
 Norman
 Lear,
 his


father's
 friend.
 And
 this
 was
 for
 the


sitcom


>> from
 television
 city
 in
 Hollywood.


>> All
 in
 the
 family.


>> Boy,
 the
 way
 Glen
 Miller
 played


songs.


>> It
 was
 a
 defining
 television
 show
 of
 the


1970s
 for
 the
 way
 it
 put
 generational


conflict
 on
 display.
 This
 was
 a
 time


when,
 you
 know,
 members
 of
 the
 silent


generation
 like
 the
 show's
 patriarch


Archie
 Bunker
 were
 really
 grappling
 with


the
 youth
 counterculture
 that
 stemmed


from
 the
 1960s
 and
 the
 anti-war


movement.
 And
 Rob
 Reiner's
 character
 was


this
 guy
 named
 Michael
 Stivik.
 He
 was
 a


leftist,
 a
 pacifist
 hippie,
 and
 he
 was


really
 the
 avatar
 for
 that
 younger


generation.


>> Anything
 interesting
 in
 the
 paper?


>> Yeah.
 200
 arrested
 in
 Vietnam
 Day
 peace


demonstration.
 200.
 They
 should
 have


thrown
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 them
 in
 the
 can.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 they
 just
 don't
 like
 the


idea
 of
 America
 fighting
 an
 illegal
 and


immoral
 war.


>> Well,
 if
 they
 don't
 like
 it,
 they
 can


lump
 it,


take
 it
 down
 the
 road,
 and
 dump
 it.


And
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 show's
 comedy
 came
 from


this
 back
 and
 forth
 between
 Archie


Bunker,
 the
 conservative
 father-in-law,


to
 Mike
 Stivic,
 who
 he
 calls,
 "You
 are
 a


meatthead."


>> Meatthead,


>> right?


>> A
 meatthead.
 Dead
 from
 the
 neck
 up.
 Meat


head.


>> And
 even
 though
 they
 weren't,
 you
 know,


father
 and
 son
 by
 blood,
 this
 was
 a
 show


with
 a
 strong
 undercurrent
 of
 this


familial
 narrative.


And
 the
 two
 would
 fight
 over
 politics,


over
 Michael's
 lack
 of
 a
 job
 that
 Archie


would
 deem
 respectable.


>> That's
 all
 you
 care
 about,
 Archie,
 is


what
 you
 got
 and
 how
 you
 can
 keep
 it.


>> Well,
 YOU'D
 CARE
 ABOUT
 IT,
 TOO,
 SUNNY


BOY,
 IF
 YOU
 HAD
 ANYTHING.


>> It
 wasn't
 living
 on
 for
 me
 without
 a
 pot


to
 peel
 a
 potato
 in.


>> And
 yet,
 there's
 also
 this
 deep


undercurrent
 of
 love
 between
 them,


>> right?
 There
 are
 moments
 of
 real


connection.
 And
 the
 scene
 that
 comes
 to


mind
 immediately
 is
 one
 where
 they're


stuck
 together
 in
 a
 storage
 room
 full
 of


alcohol
 and
 you
 know
 both
 of
 them
 are


drunk
 and
 talking
 about
 their
 fathers.


>> Did
 you
 ever
 think
 that
 that
 possibly


your
 your
 father
 just
 might
 be
 wrong?


>> Wrong
 my
 old
 man.
 Don't
 be
 stupid
 with


my
 old
 man.
 I
 mean
 tell
 you
 about
 him.


He
 was
 never
 wrong
 about
 nothing.
 Huh?


Yes,
 he
 was,
 Arch.


>> I


>> My
 old
 man
 used
 to
 call
 people
 the
 same


things
 as
 your
 old
 man,
 but
 I
 always


knew
 he
 was
 wrong.
 So
 was
 your
 old
 man.


>> No,
 he
 was.


>> Yes,
 he
 was.


>> Your
 father
 WAS
 WRONG.


>> YOUR
 FATHER
 WAS
 WRONG.


>> It's
 this
 moment
 where
 Archie
 Bunker


>> kind
 of
 whether
 he
 wants
 to
 or
 not,


unloads


a
 lot
 about
 his
 own


childhood.


father
 who
 made
 you


wrong.
 Your
 father,


the
 bread
 winner
 of
 the
 house
 there,
 the


man
 who
 goes
 out
 and
 bust
 his
 butt
 to


keep
 a
 roof
 over
 your
 head
 and
 close
 on


your
 back.
 You
 call
 your
 father
 wrong.


Hey,
 your
 father.


Archie
 Bunker
 has
 this
 conviction
 that


he
 shares
 with
 Michael
 Spivik
 that
 a


father
 cannot
 be
 wrong.


>> And
 yet
 he
 explains
 all
 that
 his
 father


did
 to
 him
 as
 a
 child.


>> My
 father
 had
 a
 hand
 on
 him.
 Now
 let's


tell
 you
 he
 busted
 that
 hand
 once
 and
 he


busted
 her
 on
 me


to
 teach
 me
 to
 do
 good.


I
 far
 a
 shoved
 me
 in
 a
 closet.
 Mr.
 7


teach
 me
 to
 do
 good


cuz
 he
 loved
 me.
 He
 loved
 me.


>> And
 yet
 there's
 still
 this
 nagging


conviction
 that
 a
 father
 can't
 be
 wrong.


>> Let
 me
 tell
 you
 something.


You're
 supposed
 to
 love
 your
 father


cuz
 your
 father
 loves
 you.


And
 how
 can
 any
 man
 that
 loves
 you


tell
 you
 anything
 is
 wrong?


>> And
 as
 Archie
 Bunker
 is
 telling
 the


story,
 the
 reaction
 of
 Michael,


it
 seems
 to
 dawn
 on
 him
 why
 his


father-in-law
 is
 like
 this,
 why
 he's
 so


harsh
 on
 him,
 why
 their
 relationship
 can


be
 so
 at
 odds,
 because
 he
 doesn't
 always


act
 like
 his
 father-in-law
 is
 always


right.
 And
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 scene,
 you


know,
 as
 Archie
 Bunker
 lies
 down
 and


falls
 asleep,
 there's
 this
 really
 tender


moment
 where
 Michael
 gets
 up
 and


puts
 the
 blanket
 over
 him
 almost
 in
 a


fatherly
 way,


>> right?
 The
 son-in-law,
 Reiner,
 becomes


in
 a
 sense
 the
 father,
 the
 parent
 of
 a


suddenly
 quite
 openly
 wounded,
 although


not
 self-aware,
 of
 his
 wounds,
 Archie


Bunker.
 It's
 a
 really
 tender
 moment
 and


in
 this
 comedy
 it
 really
 stands
 out
 as


a
 moment
 of
 real
 substance.


This
 was
 a
 huge
 breakout
 role
 for


Reiner.
 He
 won
 two
 Emmys
 and
 he
 spent


really
 the
 second
 half
 of
 his
 20s
 and


into
 his
 30s
 on
 this
 show.
 But
 he
 had


this
 nagging
 feeling
 that
 he
 wanted
 to


do
 more.
 He
 wanted
 to
 direct.
 And
 so


after
 All
 in
 the
 Family
 ended,
 he
 became


a
 prolific
 film
 director
 and
 his
 first


major
 feature
 film
 was
 This
 is
 Spinal


Tap
 in
 1984.


>> Your
 first
 drummer
 was
 uh


>> Stampy
 Peeps.


>> Great
 great
 uh
 tall
 blonde
 geek
 with


glasses.


>> Uh


>> good
 drama.


>> Great
 look.
 Good
 drama.
 Yeah.
 Fine.


>> What
 happened
 to
 him?


>> He
 died.
 He
 he
 died
 in
 a
 bizarre


gardening
 accident
 some
 years
 back.


>> And
 for
 those
 who
 don't
 know
 that
 movie,


it's
 quite
 specific.


>> Yes.
 It's
 this
 satire
 about
 a
 hapless


British
 metal
 band
 that
 really
 helped


define
 the
 form
 of
 mockumentary.


>> This
 is
 a
 top
 to
 you
 know
 what
 we
 use
 on


stage,
 but
 it's
 very
 very
 special


because
 if
 you
 can
 see


>> Yeah.


>> the
 numbers
 all
 go
 to
 11.
 Look
 right


across
 the
 board.
 11.
 And
 most
 of
 the


amps
 go
 up
 to
 10.


>> Exactly.


>> And
 Reiner's
 in
 this
 movie.
 He
 doesn't


just
 direct,


>> right?
 He's
 in
 it
 as
 kind
 of
 the


straight
 man.


>> Louder.


>> Why
 don't
 you
 just
 make
 10
 louder
 and


make
 10
 be
 the
 top
 number
 and
 make
 that


a
 little
 louder?


>> These
 go
 to
 11.
 And
 this
 release
 really


started
 the
 spectacular
 eight
 years
 of


cinema
 for
 Reiner
 where
 he
 leapfrogged


from
 genre
 to
 genre
 and
 really
 became
 a


force
 in
 Hollywood.
 You
 had
 the
 coming


of
 age
 drama
 Stand
 by
 Me.


>> You
 had
 the
 fantasy
 adventure
 film
 The


Princess
 Bride.


>> Hello,
 my
 name
 is
 Enigo
 Montoya.
 You


killed
 my
 father.
 Prepare
 to
 die.


>> Stop
 saying
 that.
 You
 had
 the


psychological
 thriller
 Misery.


>> You
 dirty
 bird.
 How
 could
 you?


>> The
 courtroom
 drama
 A
 Few
 Good
 Men.


>> You
 want
 answers.
 I
 THINK
 I'M
 ENTITLED.


YOU
 WANT
 ANSWERS.


>> I
 WANT
 THE
 TRUTH.
 YOU
 CAN'T
 HANDLE
 THE


TRUTH.


>> And
 of
 course,
 the
 romcom,
 probably
 his


most
 famous
 movie
 of
 all,
 When
 Harry
 Met


Sally.


>> But
 I
 would
 be
 proud.


>> But
 I
 would
 be
 proud


>> to
 partake


>> to
 partake


>> of
 your
 pean.
 of
 your
 peacon
 pie.


>> Peac,


>> right?
 And
 these
 movies
 are
 not
 just


memorable.
 They
 literally
 become
 part
 of


pop
 culture,
 part
 of
 our
 vernacular.


There
 is
 a
 quote
 from
 each
 and
 every
 one


of
 the
 movies
 you
 just
 mentioned
 that


either
 one
 of
 us
 could
 recite
 back
 to


each
 other,
 including,
 and
 this
 is
 from


Spinal
 Tap.
 It's
 such
 a
 fine
 line


between
 stupid
 and
 clever


>> or
 from
 a
 few
 good
 men,
 you
 can't
 handle


the
 truth.


>> I
 can't
 handle
 the
 truth.


>> And
 what's
 fascinating
 about
 this
 string


of
 movies
 is
 that
 Reiner
 would
 often
 tap


into
 his
 own
 personal
 experiences
 in


making
 them.


>> I
 think
 he
 said
 that's
 what
 kept
 him


honest
 as
 a
 filmmaker.
 And
 one
 example


of
 that
 is
 Stand
 by
 Me,
 which
 is
 based


on
 a
 nolla
 by
 Stephen
 King.


>> It's
 not
 the
 secret.


I
 forget
 the
 secret.
 Let
 me
 in.


>> Ver.


>> And
 it's
 about
 four
 pre-teen
 boys
 who


have
 this
 adventure.


>> So,
 what
 are
 you
 pissing
 and
 moaning


about,
 Verno?


>> You
 guys
 want
 to
 go
 see
 a
 dead
 body?


>> Trying
 to
 find
 this
 dead
 body.
 And
 along


the
 way,
 they're
 revealing
 the
 story
 of


who
 each
 of
 them
 are,


>> right?


>> And
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 protagonist,


this
 12-year-old
 aspiring
 writer,
 he
 has


this
 devastating
 scene
 where
 he
 breaks


down
 in
 front
 of
 his
 friend.
 Why
 did
 he


have
 to
 die,
 Chris?


Why
 did
 Denny
 have
 to
 die?


Why?


>> His
 brother,
 his
 beloved
 older
 brother,


had
 just
 died.
 And
 he
 was
 expressing
 how


he
 felt
 like
 his
 father
 wishes
 that
 he


was
 the
 one
 who
 died.


>> He
 hates
 me.
 He
 doesn't
 hate
 you.


He
 hates
 me.


>> No,
 he
 just
 doesn't
 know
 you.


>> He
 hates
 me.
 My
 dad
 hates
 me.


and
 his
 friend
 is
 sitting
 there
 trying


to
 console
 him
 in
 the
 best
 way
 he
 can,


you
 know,
 as
 a
 kid.
 And
 Reiner
 would
 say


that
 that
 is
 how
 he
 felt
 as
 a
 little


boy.


>> You're
 going
 to
 be
 a
 great
 writer


someday,
 Gordy.


You
 might
 even
 write
 about
 us
 guys
 if


you
 ever
 get
 hard
 up
 for
 material.


>> He
 felt
 like
 the
 character
 Gordy
 talking


to
 his
 friend,


>> right?
 And
 he
 felt
 like
 his
 father


didn't
 know
 him.


And
 of
 course,
 Reiner's
 personal
 life


ends
 up
 figuring
 into
 the
 plot
 of
 When


Harry
 Met
 Sally,


>> right?
 Reiner
 had
 the
 idea
 for
 When


Harry
 Met
 Sally
 after
 he
 divorced
 his


first
 wife
 and
 he
 was
 back
 in
 the
 dating


pool.
 And
 actually
 in
 the
 making
 of
 that


movie,
 he
 was
 introduced
 to
 his
 wife


Michelle.
 And
 the
 way
 he
 tells
 it,
 he


actually
 changed
 the
 ending
 of
 the
 movie


after
 meeting
 Michelle.
 He
 changed
 it
 so


that
 the
 two
 protagonists
 end
 up


together,


>> right?
 And
 it's
 actually
 kind
 of


unfathomable
 that
 that
 movie
 would
 end


any
 other
 way
 than
 it
 did
 with
 Harry
 and


Sally
 in
 that
 famous
 scene
 telling
 each


other
 that
 they
 love
 each
 other
 and
 that


they
 will
 be
 together.


>> Absolutely.
 It's
 film
 history.
 And
 over


the
 years,
 Riner's
 success
 goes
 beyond


even
 directing.
 He
 starts
 this


production
 company,
 Castle
 Rock,
 that


ends
 up
 creating
 some
 of
 classic
 movies.


and
 Seinfeld.


>> Exactly.
 It
 actually
 produced
 one
 of
 the


most
 successful
 comedy
 series
 in


history,
 Seinfeld.


>> Pretty
 full
 circle
 for
 a
 guy
 who
 stars


in
 one
 of the
 great
 sitcoms
 of
 his
 era.


>> Right.
 And
 he
 also
 has
 this
 vibrant


political
 life.
 He
 gets
 really
 involved


in
 the
 fight
 for
 gay
 marriage.
 He


actually
 spearheads
 a
 ballot
 measure


revolving
 around
 early
 education
 in


California.
 He
 becomes
 this
 really


multiaceted
 figure
 that
 is
 known
 for


more
 than
 just
 his
 film
 making.


>> Right.
 And
 he
 becomes
 a
 thorn
 in
 the


side
 of
 President
 Trump.


>> Absolutely.
 I
 mean
 Reiner
 was
 against


Trump
 from
 the
 beginning
 became
 a
 vocal


critic
 over
 the
 years
 and
 in
 one
 of
 his


final
 interviews
 in
 recent
 months
 warned


that
 Trump
 was
 leading
 the
 country
 into


autocracy.
 And
 this
 was
 all
 thrown
 into


sharp
 relief
 after
 his
 death
 when
 Trump


suggested
 that
 his
 death
 had
 to
 do
 with


Reiner's
 own
 opposition
 to
 him.


>> Right.
 Which
 is
 a
 pretty
 wildly


unsubstantiated,
 I
 dare
 say
 reckless


claim.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 Julia
 brings
 us


back
 to
 Reiner's
 relationship
 with
 his


son,
 which
 we
 started
 with.
 And
 I
 know


that
 the
 two
 father
 and
 son
 end
 up


working
 on
 a
 film
 together,


>> right?
 As
 everyone
 sifts
 through
 what


there
 is
 on
 the
 internet
 about
 the


relationship
 between
 Nick
 and
 his


parents,
 what
 keeps
 coming
 to
 the
 four


are
 these
 interviews
 that
 he
 did
 with


his
 father
 when
 they
 were
 making
 this


movie
 together.


>> Right.
 And
 just
 remind
 us
 about
 this


movie.
 It's
 called
 Being
 Charlie
 and


it's
 actually
 loosely
 based
 on
 their
 own


relationship
 focused
 on
 a
 son
 who
 is


battling
 a
 drug
 addiction
 and
 a
 father


who's
 an
 actor
 turned
 politician.


>> And
 the
 idea
 from
 this
 movie
 came
 from


Nick
 Reiner
 when
 he
 was
 in
 rehab.
 You


know,
 throughout
 his
 teenage
 years,
 he


said
 he
 was
 in
 treatment
 roughly
 18


different
 times.
 Wow.
 And
 in
 one
 of


those
 rehab
 facilities,
 he
 meets
 a


friend
 who
 he
 starts
 working
 on
 a
 script


with,
 and
 they're
 pulling
 from
 their


experiences
 with
 drug
 addiction.
 Now,


eventually,
 Rob
 Reiner
 embraces
 the
 idea


of
 making
 the
 script
 into
 a
 fulllength


film,
 and
 that
 becomes
 Being
 Charlie,


which
 is
 directed
 by
 Rob
 Reiner.
 Mhm.


>> There
 was
 clearly
 a
 deep
 conflict


between
 Nick
 and
 his
 parents
 over
 how
 to


approach
 his
 own
 addiction
 recovery.
 And


those
 themes
 really
 shine
 through
 in
 the


movie.


>> There's
 this
 line
 where
 the
 father
 in


the
 movie
 is
 talking
 to
 his
 son
 who's


battling
 drug
 addiction.
 And
 the
 father


says,
 "All
 I
 could
 tell
 myself
 was,
 I'd


rather
 have
 you
 alive
 and
 hating
 me
 than


dead
 on
 the
 streets."


>> Wow.
 And
 so
 during
 this
 round
 of


interviews,
 Rob
 and
 Nick
 are
 talking


about
 how
 this
 movie
 affected
 their


relationship.


>> And
 how
 did
 it
 affect
 it?


>> We
 didn't
 do
 it
 to
 be
 cathartic,
 but
 it


turned
 out
 that
 that's
 what
 what


happened.
 I
 mean,


>> Rob
 said
 it
 made
 him
 understand
 his
 son


a
 lot
 more
 and
 that
 he
 hoped
 it
 made
 him


a
 better
 father.


>> And
 that
 brought
 us
 closer
 together.


>> And
 Nick
 said,


>> we
 didn't
 bond
 a
 lot
 as
 a
 kid.
 Like
 he


really
 liked
 baseball.
 I
 like


basketball.
 and
 he
 could
 watch
 that
 with


my
 brother.
 But
 baseball,


>> even
 though
 he
 and
 his
 father
 didn't


bond
 a
 lot
 as
 a
 kid,
 it
 better
 helped


him
 understand
 his
 dad.


>> It
 made
 me
 feel
 closer
 to
 him.


>> And
 in
 those
 interviews,
 it's
 clear


that,
 you
 know,
 Nick
 and
 his
 parents
 had


worked
 very
 hard
 to
 keep
 him
 sober.
 But


Nick
 also
 talked
 later
 about
 relapsing


after
 the
 movie
 came
 out.
 It
 was


>> after
 this
 healing
 exercise
 of
 making
 a


movie
 with
 his
 dad,


>> right?
 There
 was
 a
 podcast
 where
 he


talks
 about
 having
 a
 heart
 attack
 on
 a


plane
 from
 cocaine
 use
 and
 ending
 up
 in


the
 hospital.
 And
 there's
 another
 time


he
 talks
 about
 being
 on
 cocaine
 and


completely
 wrecking
 his
 parents'
 guest


house
 which
 he
 lived
 in
 where
 he
 punches


the
 television,
 punches
 a
 lamp,
 you


know,
 and
 that
 the
 whole
 place
 ends
 up


in
 shambles.
 So,
 in
 these
 interviews,


it's
 clear
 that
 the
 whole
 family
 was


striving
 for
 sobriety
 for
 Nick
 and
 some


lasting
 stability
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 family


relationship.


>> Right.


>> But
 it
 never
 came.


>> Well,
 Julia,
 thank
 you
 very
 much.
 We


appreciate
 it.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


After
 the
 break,
 Wesley
 Morris
 on
 why


Rob
 Reiner's
 movies
 are
 so
 beloved.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


>> Wesley,
 thank
 you
 for
 making
 time
 for


us.


>> Of
 course.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 sad
 that
 it
 has


to
 be
 under
 these
 circumstances.


>> It's
 a
 really
 sad
 circumstance.
 as
 our


colleague
 Julia
 Jacobs
 just
 walked
 us


through.
 It's
 a
 really
 it's
 a
 really


tragic
 end
 to
 a
 remarkable


>> career.
 And
 the
 reason
 we've
 asked
 you


to
 come
 in
 the
 studio
 is
 because
 we


wanted
 a
 critics's
 assessment
 of
 the


career
 and
 the
 work
 of
 Rob
 Reiner.
 You


are
 the
 Times
 chief
 critic.
 You're
 also,


and
 I
 know
 this
 from
 firsthand


experience,
 a
 genuine
 film
 buff.
 So
 in


that
 context,
 what
 is
 the
 significance


in
 your
 mind
 of
 Reiner
 and
 the
 films


that
 he
 directed?
 What
 kind
 of
 a


filmmaker
 was
 he
 in
 your
 mind?
 He
 was


the
 sort
 of
 director
 who
 was
 really


interested
 in
 pleasing
 people,
 right?
 He


wanted
 to
 make
 movies
 that
 made
 people


happy.


even
 when
 they
 were
 like
 dark
 movies.
 He


was
 looking
 for
 a
 way
 to


find
 the
 pleasure
 centers
 that
 we
 as


movie
 goers
 needed
 met
 when
 we
 went
 to
 a


movie
 theater
 or
 you
 know
 because
 a
 lot


of
 the
 times
 with
 Reiner,
 you
 would
 be


watching
 these
 movies
 at
 home
 over
 and


over
 and
 over
 again
 over
 and
 over
 again


and
 because
 they
 somehow
 made
 their
 way


onto
 your
 TV
 screen
 at
 home
 over
 and


over
 and
 over.


>> Oh
 yeah.
 Whether
 you
 went
 to
 a
 video


store
 and
 pulled
 one
 of
 those
 movies
 off


the
 shelf
 or
 it
 was
 just
 on
 cable
 all


the
 time.


>> Mhm.


>> The
 thing
 about
 them
 that
 is
 so


wonderful
 is
 also
 the
 thing
 that
 made


Rob
 Reiner
 kind
 of
 um
 he
 wasn't
 a


critics's
 director,
 right?


>> In
 a
 lot
 of
 ways,
 you
 go
 back
 and
 read


the
 reviews
 of
 his
 movies
 and
 it
 would


always
 be
 the
 charge
 would
 be
 the
 movies


didn't
 go
 far
 enough.
 They
 didn't
 go


deep
 enough.
 They
 weren't
 getting
 into


like
 the
 nitty-gritty
 of
 human


relationships
 in
 the
 way
 that
 they


probably
 could
 have,
 right?
 In
 fact,
 I


went
 through
 this
 exercise
 within
 the


last
 24
 hours
 and
 it
 should
 be
 humbling


to
 the
 film
 critics
 of
 the
 world.
 You
 go


back
 and
 look
 at
 the
 reviews
 of


something
 like
 Stand
 By
 Me.


>> Sure.


>> I
 just
 wish


that
 I
 could
 go
 someplace
 when
 nobody


knows
 me.


in
 the
 times.
 Too
 much
 saccharine,
 but


that
 that's
 not
 the
 experience
 of
 a


young
 Michael
 Barbaro
 watching
 Stand
 by


Me
 and
 finding
 it
 to
 be
 a
 complete


revelation
 of
 what
 brotherhood,


fraternity,


>> and
 youthful
 adventure


>> might
 look
 like.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 the


thing
 about
 Rybriner
 that's
 that's


important
 to
 make
 the
 distinction


between
 is
 a
 question
 of
 what
 the


greatest
 movies
 are
 and
 what
 your


favorite
 movies
 are.
 He
 makes
 your


favorites.


>> That
 man
 has
 made
 your
 favorite
 movie.


He
 has
 made
 one
 of
 your
 favorite
 movies


and
 everybody's
 got
 one.
 He's
 made
 two


of
 my
 favorite
 movies.
 And
 like,
 you


know,
 uh,
 when
 Harry
 Met
 Sally,
 I
 mean,


come
 on.
 There's
 a
 couple
 things
 with


Rob
 Reiner
 that
 makes
 this
 outpouring
 of


grief
 over
 his
 death
 important.
 His
 peak


as
 a
 director
 was
 at
 a
 time
 when
 the


movies
 were
 interested
 in
 just
 simple


things
 brought
 to
 life
 by
 a
 good
 script


and
 a
 couple
 of
 stars.
 These
 are
 not


values
 the
 movies
 have
 anymore.
 These


are
 bygone
 aspects
 of
 American
 movie


making.
 And
 he
 embodied
 he
 was
 one
 of


the
 principal
 embodiment
 his
 movies
 were


of
 that
 era.
 For
 me,
 when
 Harry
 Met


Sally
 was
 great
 because
 it
 had
 these
 two


people
 that
 I
 kind
 of
 knew,
 Meg
 Ryan
 and


Billy
 Crystal.


>> Rob
 Reiner
 made
 them
 movie
 stars.
 This


movie
 made
 them
 movie
 stars.


>> It's
 kind
 of
 hard
 to
 imagine
 that
 they


weren't
 movie
 stars
 before
 that,
 but


somehow.


>> Yeah,
 you
 had
 seen
 them
 in
 things


before.
 And
 you
 know,
 Billy
 Crystal
 was


a
 well-known
 comic
 and
 Meg
 Ryan
 was


somebody
 who'd
 been
 in
 other
 movies
 as


like
 a
 supporting
 character.
 And
 you


also
 had
 in
 Harry
 Metal
 this
 great


script
 by
 Norah
 Efron.
 Norah
 Efron,


William
 Goldman,
 Aaron
 Sorcin,
 they


wrote
 the
 great
 Rob
 Reiner
 movies
 and
 he


knew
 what
 to
 do
 with
 a
 good
 screenplay


and
 good
 actors.
 And
 part
 of
 the


pleasure
 of
 watching
 them
 all
 congeal


just
 come
 together
 and
 you
 know


transmogriphy
 into
 this
 like
 amazing


experience
 of
 just
 feeling
 right.
 I
 mean


you
 watch
 the
 princess
 bride
 and
 it's


all
 exuberance.
 You
 watch
 when
 Harry
 met


Sally
 and
 it's
 just
 whatever
 you
 believe


about
 people
 getting
 together
 and
 like


spending
 time
 with
 each
 other
 and


communicating.
 It's
 amazing.
 You
 look


like
 a
 normal
 person,
 but
 actually,
 you


are
 the
 angel
 of
 death.


>> Are
 you
 going
 to
 marry
 him?


>> We
 have
 only
 known
 each
 other
 for
 a


month,
 and
 besides,
 neither
 one
 of
 us
 is


looking
 to
 get
 married
 right
 now.


>> I'm
 getting
 married.


>> You
 are?


>> Mhm.


>> You
 are?


>> Yeah.


>> Just
 some
 great
 talking
 issue.


>> Well,
 you're
 getting
 on
 your
 own
 to
 what


I


>> deeply
 would
 love
 for
 you
 to
 do,


>> okay?
 which
 is
 to
 take
 us
 into
 one
 scene


of
 a
 Reiner
 directed
 film.
 And
 at
 this


point,
 I
 have
 to
 believe
 because
 of
 what


you've
 already
 said
 that
 that
 scene
 is


going
 to
 be
 coming
 from
 when
 Harry
 Met


Sally.


>> Sure.
 And
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 scenes
 in


that
 movie.
 I
 think
 when
 Harry
 Met


Sally,
 to
 me,
 it's
 the
 peak
 of
 all
 his


priorities
 as
 a
 filmmaker.
 the
 human


part,
 the
 love
 part,
 and
 obviously
 if


you're
 gonna
 boil
 this
 movie
 down
 to
 one


scene,
 it's
 the
 diner
 scene,
 right?
 It's


the
 deli
 scene.


>> Me,
 Ryan,
 Sally,
 and
 Billy
 Crystal,


who's
 Harry.
 These
 people
 have
 been


friends
 now
 for
 a
 few
 years,
 and
 they


are
 very
 familiar
 with
 the
 cadences
 of


each
 other's
 dating
 and
 sex
 lives.


They
 go
 to
 have
 lunch
 one
 day
 and
 they


proceed
 to
 talk
 about
 Harry's
 latest


disappointment
 romantically.


>> It's
 not
 working
 out.


>> It's
 not
 working
 out
 and
 she's
 gone
 and


he
 has
 moved
 on.


>> So,
 what
 do
 you
 do
 with
 these
 women?
 You


just
 get
 up
 out
 of
 bed
 and
 leave.


>> Sure.


>> Well,
 explain
 to
 me
 how
 you
 do
 it.
 What


do
 you
 say?


>> Just
 have
 an
 early
 meeting,
 early


haircut,
 or
 like
 squash
 game.


>> You
 don't
 play
 squash?


>> They
 don't
 know
 that.
 They
 just
 met
 me.


>> That's
 disgusting.


>> I
 know.
 I
 feel
 terrible.
 And
 she's
 like,


"Well,
 you
 probably
 wouldn't
 know
 that
 a


woman's
 never
 been
 satisfied
 by
 you."


>> Hey,
 I
 don't
 feel
 great
 about
 this,
 but


I
 don't
 hear
 anyone
 complaining.


>> Of
 course
 not.
 You're
 out
 the
 door
 too


fast.


>> I
 think
 they
 have
 an
 okay
 time.


>> How
 do
 you
 know?


>> I
 mean,
 how
 do
 I
 know
 I
 know?


>> And
 he's
 like,
 I
 think
 I
 would
 know


because
 I
 was
 there.


>> I
 created
 the
 satisfaction.


>> Because
 they


>> Yes.
 Because
 they


>> How
 do
 you
 know
 that
 they're
 really?


>> What
 are
 you
 saying?
 That
 they
 fake


orgasm?


>> She's
 like
 Me
 Ryan.
 Sally
 says,
 "Well,


>> why?
 Most
 women
 at
 one
 time
 or
 another


have
 faked
 it?"


>> I'm
 telling
 you
 that
 most
 women
 at
 some


point
 in
 their
 lives
 have
 faked
 it.


>> Well,
 they
 have
 never
 faked
 it
 with
 me.


>> How
 do
 you
 know?


>> Because
 I
 know.


>> And
 he's
 like,
 "No,
 they
 haven't.
 That's


insane,


>> right?
 That's
 right.
 I
 forgot
 you're
 a


man.


>> What
 is
 that
 supposed
 to
 mean?


>> Nothing.
 It's
 just
 that
 all
 men
 are
 sure


it
 never
 happened
 to
 them
 and
 most
 women


at
 one
 time
 or
 another
 have
 done
 it.
 So,


you
 do
 the
 math.


>> You
 don't
 think
 that
 I
 can
 tell
 the


difference?


>> No.


>> Get
 out
 of
 here.


>> So,
 cut
 to
 me
 Ryan.
 Her
 eyes
 go,
 "Oh,


okay."
 There's
 a
 like
 a
 twinkle,
 like
 a


little
 mischievous
 twinkle.


>> She's
 telling
 us,
 she's
 telegraphing
 to


us
 what
 she's
 about
 to
 do.
 And
 she
 kind


of
 half
 smiles
 and
 she
 proceeds
 to
 start


her
 orgasm.


>> Oh,


are
 you
 okay?


>> And
 she
 does
 not
 break.


And
 this
 is
 a
 really
 difficult
 thing
 to


do
 both
 directing
 and
 editing
 wise


because
 you
 have
 to
 there's
 a
 rhythm


that
 has
 to
 be
 maintained
 here.


>> Oh
 god.


Ooh.
 Oh
 god.


>> But
 you
 also
 have
 to
 establish
 that
 she


is
 staying
 in
 this
 orgasm
 and
 he
 is


going
 to
 suffer
 through
 the
 discomfort


of
 watching
 her
 perform
 it.


>> Oh
 yeah.
 Right
 there.


And
 that
 all
 of
 this,
 we
 should
 just


remind
 the
 listener,
 revolves
 around
 the


consumption
 of
 a
 very
 averagel
 looking


sandwich.
 That's
 we
 got
 to
 talk
 about


the
 sandwich
 cuz
 it's
 just
 a
 pile
 of


meat.
 But
 there's
 a
 cut
 to
 Harry
 and
 his


increasing
 awareness
 that
 what
 is


happening
 is
 happening
 and
 he
 is
 about


to
 lose
 this
 this
 argument.
 But
 Billy


Crystal
 is
 performing
 increasing


mortification
 at
 the
 fact
 not
 it's


interesting
 because
 it's
 simultaneously


him
 losing
 this
 argument
 and
 him
 being


embarrassed
 by
 this
 spectacle
 that
 she's


creating


>> and
 there's
 so
 many
 looks
 on
 his
 face
 of


just
 like
 oh
 my
 god
 she's
 oh
 my
 god
 oh


my
 god
 and
 he's
 like
 oh
 my
 god
 and
 so


there's
 this
 tension
 there's
 this
 like


physics
 between
 his


mort
 mortification
 and
 her
 ecstasy.


And
 an
 important
 thing
 happens
 at
 about


the
 30th
 second
 in
 this
 scene.


>> Wow.
 You
 really


>> of
 the
 orgasm
 part
 of
 the
 scene.
 The


scene
 goes
 like
 3
 minutes
 long.
 It's


this.
 The
 cameras
 on
 Meg
 Ryan
 mid
 fake


orgasm
 and
 a
 man
 turns
 around
 behind
 her


and
 he
 is
 wearing
 a
 Yankees
 cap
 and
 he


is
 completely
 dead
 pan
 but
 looking
 in


her
 direction
 and
 it's
 just
 the
 two
 of


them
 in
 this
 shot
 and
 you
 realize,
 oh
 my


god,
 you
 as
 a
 viewer
 realizes
 they're


not
 going
 to
 do
 the
 thing
 that
 a


television
 show
 would
 do.
 This
 is
 the


Rob
 Reiner
 going
 to
 the
 movies
 part.


This
 is
 Norah
 Efron
 knowing
 how
 the


world
 works.
 We're
 not
 going
 to
 pretend


that
 this
 is
 a
 closed
 environment
 and


these
 people
 are
 just
 here
 to
 make
 you


think
 you're
 in
 a
 diner.


>> Mhm.


>> People
 are
 going
 to
 hear
 this
 orgasm.


>> Lots
 of
 people.


>> Cuz
 it
 could
 have
 ended
 just
 like
 that.


It
 could
 have
 ended
 the
 minute
 that
 guy


in
 the
 Yankees
 cap
 turns
 around.
 Even


before
 that,
 Billy
 Crystal
 was
 selling


the
 comedy
 in
 this
 bit
 as
 much
 as
 Meg


Ryan
 is.
 You
 could
 have
 just
 ended
 it


right
 there.
 That
 scene
 could
 have
 ended


and
 she
 would
 just
 like
 arrest
 my
 case.


>> But
 instead,
 this
 scene
 goes
 on
 for
 like


another
 30
 seconds.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 it's
 deeply
 uncomfortable.


>> No,
 Michael.
 No,
 it's
 not
 uncomfortable


at
 all.
 It's
 hilarious.


>> Hilariously
 uncomfortable.


>> And
 the
 thing
 that
 makes
 it
 hilarious
 is


us,
 the
 people
 watching
 this
 woman
 fake


this
 orgasm.
 They
 don't
 know
 she's


faking
 it.
 They
 don't
 know
 what's
 going


on.
 This
 This
 sandwich
 must
 be
 real


good.
 This
 pile
 of
 meat
 must
 be
 doing


something
 to
 this
 woman.


Every
 subsequent
 shot
 during
 this


sequence,
 we've
 established
 how
 Meg
 Ryan


is
 going
 to
 perform
 her
 fake
 orgasm.
 We


understand
 that
 Billy
 Crystal
 is


mortified.


But
 now
 we
 spend
 the
 rest
 of
 this


sequence,
 most
 of
 the
 rest
 of
 it,


watching
 everybody
 else
 in
 the
 deli


react.


>> Oh
 yes.


>> Like
 not
 even
 react.
 They're
 just


watching
 her
 do
 this.
 And
 it's
 it's
 an


amazing
 site
 because
 some
 people
 are


concerned,
 some
 people
 are
 like,
 you


know,
 it's
 New
 York,
 so
 this
 is
 also
 one


of the
 great
 New
 York
 movies,
 right?
 So


it's
 New
 York
 and
 people
 are
 like,
 "Oh,


it's
 orgasm
 day,
 I
 guess,
 on
 the
 deli."


Okay,
 great.
 Fantastic.


And
 she
 reaches
 her
 climax.


>> YES.
 YES.
 OH.


OH,
 GOD.


>> She
 picks
 up
 her
 fork.
 She
 stabs
 her


salad
 or
 whatever
 it
 is
 that's
 on
 that


plate.
 She
 takes
 a
 bite
 and
 we
 go
 from


shot,
 reverse
 shot,
 cutaway,
 cutaway,


cutaway
 to
 a
 like
 I
 would
 say
 a
 a
 master


shot
 of
 the
 two
 of
 them
 facing
 each


other
 in
 the
 booth.
 And
 you
 can
 see
 in


the
 background
 two
 women
 also
 having
 a


meal
 looking
 at
 me
 Ryan


>> and
 the
 famous
 line
 cuz
 the
 scene
 could


have
 ended.


>> Right.
 Right.


>> When
 she
 picks
 up
 the
 fork,
 we're
 done.


We're
 done.
 This
 scene
 is
 already


killed.
 But
 he
 goes
 for
 it.
 We're
 done.


And
 this
 woman
 says
 to
 the
 waiter,


you
 know
 the
 line.


>> I'll
 have
 what
 she's
 having.


>> I'll
 have
 what
 she's
 having.
 Yeah.
 It's


one
 of the
 most
 memorable
 lines
 in
 all


of
 cinema.


>> It
 never
 gets
 old.
 You
 could
 watch
 that


once
 a
 week
 and
 still
 pee
 your
 pants


because


>> that's
 how
 that's
 how
 joyful
 it
 is.


>> It's
 just
 how
 joyful
 it
 is.
 Also,
 it's


so
 New
 York.
 I
 just


>> But
 by
 the
 way,
 that's
 his
 that's
 his


mom
 who
 says
 it.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 Estelle
 Reiner
 is
 the
 person


who
 delivers
 the
 line.


>> Perfection.


>> Perfection.
 But
 also,
 the
 thing
 that


kills
 is
 not
 just
 the
 line.
 It's
 the


look
 of
 like,
 I
 guess
 I'll
 have
 to
 have


what
 she's
 having.
 like
 her
 face
 is
 like


it's
 not
 she
 does
 not
 look
 delighted.


>> She
 looks
 kind
 of
 disgusted


>> and
 repulsed,
 but
 it's
 like
 I
 just
 need


to
 see
 what
 this
 is
 all
 about.
 It's
 as


funny
 as
 it
 is
 because
 Rob
 Reiner
 keeps


going,
 right?


>> And
 he
 understands
 there's
 still
 another


joke
 in
 there
 somewhere.
 I
 want
 to
 I


want
 to
 get
 all
 the
 jokes
 out.
 So,
 I


want
 to
 pause


>> Yeah.
 for
 just
 a
 moment


>> and
 talk
 about
 how
 you
 how
 we
 should


juxtapose


all
 of
 the
 hilarity
 and
 joy
 that
 you


just
 described


>> that
 defines
 these
 films.
 How
 we're


supposed
 to
 hold
 that
 in
 one
 hand
 and


the
 brutality
 and
 the
 awfulness
 of
 how


his
 life
 ends


in
 the
 other.


The
 terrible
 thing
 about
 this
 death,
 a


terrible
 thing
 about
 it
 in
 terms
 of
 the


millions
 of
 people
 who
 never
 met,
 didn't


know
 Rob
 Reiner,
 but
 whose
 lives
 were


touched
 by
 his
 work
 is
 that
 the
 work
 was


about
 the
 opposite
 of
 how
 he
 died.


And
 yet,
 you
 know,
 the
 very
 moving


aspect
 of
 this
 grizzly
 tragedy
 is,
 I


mean,
 from
 all
 reports,
 you
 know,
 the


Riners
 were
 determined
 to
 like
 help


their
 son,
 right?
 The
 ethos
 of
 the


family
 life
 is
 the
 ethos
 of
 the
 film


making.


>> You
 know,
 sometimes
 to
 the
 movies's


detriment
 because
 the
 movies
 didn't
 want


to
 go
 to
 really
 dark
 places.
 The
 movies


weren't
 about
 the
 real
 darknesses,


right?
 The
 real
 difficulties.
 They
 were


about
 the
 the
 attempt
 to
 believe
 in
 our


better
 natures,
 our
 better
 selves.


>> And
 that
 is
 what
 is
 so
 shocking
 about


his
 death.
 But
 you
 know,
 I
 was,
 you


know,
 as
 one,
 as
 at least
 I
 do,
 when


great
 or
 important
 people
 die
 in
 popular


culture,


>> you
 were
 often
 tasked
 with
 eulogizing


them
 in
 print.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 you
 go
 back
 and
 you
 look


and
 see
 how
 things
 went
 for
 them
 in
 in


real
 time
 or
 how
 they've
 been


memorialized
 before
 their
 death,
 how


their
 work
 is
 considered.
 And
 I
 found,


you
 know,
 one
 of
 the
 great
 tomes,
 one
 of


the
 great
 movie
 projects
 ever.


>> Yeah,
 you're
 holding
 a
 very,
 very
 thick


book


>> is
 David
 Thompson's
 biographical


dictionary
 of
 film.


>> It's
 right
 here.
 New
 I
 got
 a
 new


biographical
 dictionary
 of
 film.
 the


Marryiam
 Webbsters
 of
 movies
 written
 by


one
 man,
 David
 Thompson.
 And
 his
 Rob


Reiner
 entry
 is


kind
 of
 amazing
 because
 he's
 a
 little


more
 dismissive
 of
 the
 wonderful
 movies.


Um,
 he
 gets
 it,
 but
 he
 doesn't
 really


they're
 not
 for
 him
 apparently.
 But


here's
 what
 he
 says
 in
 his
 dismount
 and


it's
 deep.
 As
 a
 director,
 Rob
 Reiner,
 he


seemed
 more
 struck
 or
 paxed
 by
 the


notion
 that
 niceness
 could
 save
 the


world.
 It
 is
 a
 petty
 thought,
 but
 one


that
 stifles
 so
 many
 human
 and
 social


realities.
 And
 so
 his
 work
 turns
 to
 pie


in
 the
 sky
 with
 good
 and
 bad
 all
 too


clearly
 labeled.
 He's
 carried
 along
 by
 a


fundamental
 decency
 and
 a
 sense
 of


scenes
 that
 play.
 But
 his
 films
 are


predictable
 from
 their
 first
 moments
 and


they
 begin
 to
 establish
 a
 weird
 dumb


orthodoxy.
 That
 if
 we're
 good
 to
 our


kids,
 everything
 will
 be
 okay.


>> This
 is
 not
 true.
 Life
 is
 more


interesting.


>> Wow.


>> I
 mean,


>> that
 is
 Rob
 Reiner
 was
 very
 alive
 when


that
 was
 written.
 And
 I
 think


>> that
 is
 terribly
 preient.
 I
 think
 the


thing
 that
 made
 him
 lovable,
 Rob
 Reiner,


as
 a
 human
 being,
 the
 reason
 he
 was
 so


beloved
 by
 so
 many
 different
 people


was
 that
 he


really
 believed
 in
 the
 fundamental


goodness
 of
 people


no
 matter
 what.
 You
 know,
 it's
 an


impossible
 situation
 for
 a
 parent
 to


turn
 your
 back
 on
 a
 child,


>> right?


>> And
 in
 the
 end,
 he
 did
 not.
 And
 he


didn't
 because
 you
 know
 those
 movies


were
 this
 man


for
 better
 and
 for
 worse
 but
 ultimately


for
 better
 because
 they
 were
 about
 our


better
 selves.


>> This
 was
 a
 man
 who
 believed
 in
 life.
 He


believed
 in
 people
 and
 the
 movies
 stand


as
 a
 testament
 to
 that
 belief
 as
 far
 as


I'm
 concerned.
 And
 when
 it
 clicked
 and


for
 like
 I'd
 say
 10
 years
 this
 man
 was


humming.
 It
 really
 really
 really
 made


people
 happy
 the
 work
 that
 he
 made
 and


it's
 just
 that
 you
 know
 there's
 the


family
 tragedy
 part
 and
 then
 there
 is


the
 the
 happy
 guy
 part.
 He
 just
 seemed


like
 such
 a
 joyful
 like
 a
 he
 was
 a
 big


bear
 of
 a
 man
 and


you
 just
 he
 seemed
 like
 either
 he
 was


going
 to
 hug
 you
 or
 you
 could
 hug
 him


>> completely.


>> And
 he
 would
 be
 okay
 with
 that.


His
 movies
 were
 like
 that
 too
 for
 the


most
 part.
 They
 were
 they're
 always


there
 to
 hug
 you.
 And
 if
 you
 want
 to
 hug


him
 back,
 feel
 free
 because
 they're
 on


HBO


right
 now


>> and
 Netflix
 and
 Amazon.
 Um
 Wesley,
 thank


you
 very
 very
 much.
 Appreciate
 it.


>> Michael,
 you're
 welcome.
 And
 I'm
 sorry


that
 I'm
 sorry
 that
 I
 have
 to
 be
 here
 to


do
 it.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need
 another
 day.


On
 Tuesday,
 President
 Trump
 expanded
 the


US
 travel
 ban
 to
 cover
 five
 more


countries
 and
 added
 partial
 bans
 on
 15


additional
 countries.
 The
 bans
 which


began
 in
 June
 started
 with
 countries


including
 Afghanistan,
 Myanmar
 and


Haiti.
 The
 newly
 banned
 countries


include
 Mali,
 Nishair,
 South
 Sudan,
 and


Syria.
 Palestinians
 are
 also
 now
 banned.


Those
 affected
 by
 the
 bans
 cannot


immigrate
 to
 or
 enter
 the
 United
 States.


Trump
 has
 described
 the
 banned
 countries


as
 quote
 third
 world
 and
 declared
 that


their
 citizens
 pose
 a
 threat
 to


Americans.


And
 the
 Australian
 government
 said
 that


the
 gunmen
 who
 carried
 out
 the
 mass


shooting
 at
 a
 Jewish
 celebration
 over


the
 weekend
 were
 motivated
 by
 ISIS.


Police
 said
 that
 they
 found
 two
 homemade


Islamic
 State
 flags
 in
 the
 car
 that
 the


suspects,
 a
 father
 and
 son,
 had
 driven


to
 the
 site
 of
 the
 massacre.
