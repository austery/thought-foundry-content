Did
 you
 always
 know
 that
 no
 matter
 how


long
 it
 took
 that
 you
 were
 going
 to
 do


your
 version,
 a
 version
 of
 Frankenstein?


>> Not
 really.
 I
 have
 done
 13
 movies
 and
 I


have
 written
 or
 co-written
 42.
 So
 I'm


very
 wellversed
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 I'm


never
 going
 to
 get
 to
 make
 the
 movies
 I


could
 have
 made.
 So
 and
 this
 was


complicated
 because
 I
 I
 wanted
 I
 knew
 I


wanted
 to
 make
 Imperial.
 I
 kn
 I
 knew
 I


wanted
 to
 make
 it
 uh
 the
 19th
 century


and
 I
 knew
 I
 wanted
 to
 make
 it
 big
 and


lavish
 and
 and
 oporatic.


None
 of
 these
 words
 and
 none
 of
 these


notions
 sound
 like
 a
 Hollywood


blogbuster.


I'm
 Gilbert
 Cruz.
 This
 is
 the
 book


review
 from
 the
 New
 York
 Times.
 And
 on


today's
 episode,
 it's
 Guiermo
 Del
 Toro.


GMO
 is
 a
 threetime
 Oscar-winning


director.
 And
 this
 year
 he's
 nominated


for
 his
 adaptation
 of
 Mary
 Shel's


Frankenstein.
 That
 is
 the
 classic
 novel


which
 tells
 the
 tale
 of
 scientist
 Victor


Frankenstein,
 the
 monster
 that
 he


creates
 and
 the
 many
 tragedies
 that


ensue.
 I've
 been
 a
 fan
 of
 Del
 Toro's


work
 for
 years.
 From
 Kronos,
 his
 very


first
 movie,
 through
 titles
 like
 Blade


2,
 Pan's
 Labyrinth,
 Shape
 of
 Water,
 he


is
 a
 master
 of
 mixing
 scares
 and
 tears,


and
 at
 making
 monsters
 that
 are
 both


terrifying
 and
 absolutely
 gorgeous
 to


look
 at.
 His
 new
 movie,
 Frankenstein,
 is


no
 exception.
 It
 is
 not
 an
 exaggeration


to
 say
 that
 this
 film
 is
 the
 culmination


of
 his
 life's
 work.
 It's
 a
 story
 that
 he


has
 been
 obsessed
 with
 since
 he
 was
 a


child.
 He
 was
 7
 years
 old
 when
 he
 saw


the
 classic
 1931
 film
 version.
 He
 was


only
 11
 when
 he
 read
 the
 book
 for
 the


first
 time.
 And
 when
 we
 talked,
 I
 asked


him
 to
 take
 me
 back
 to
 that
 moment.


>> Tell
 me,
 how
 did
 you
 get
 a
 copy
 of
 the


book?
 Tell
 just
 tell
 me
 the
 whole
 story.


You
 know,
 I
 used
 to
 go
 to
 a
 supermarket


near
 my
 home
 where
 I
 uh
 you
 would
 get


all
 the
 expat
 American
 magazines
 and


paperbacks
 from
 Spain
 and
 I
 would
 I


would
 shop
 for
 horror
 uh
 uh
 books
 there


and
 uh
 for
 horror
 magazines
 like
 Famous


Monsters
 of
 Filmland.
 And
 at
 that
 age,


at
 11,
 I
 pedal
 my
 bicycle
 to
 to
 to
 that


store
 and
 I
 bought
 the
 paperback


>> uh
 from
 a
 a
 Spanish
 a
 Spanish
 um


publisher
 and
 that
 was
 the
 1818
 text
 um


which
 is
 for
 me
 the
 only
 text
 uh
 the


only
 version
 of
 the
 three
 versions
 that


exist
 of
 the
 novel
 that
 were
 revised


during
 Mary
 Shel's
 life.
 The
 1818
 is
 the


most
 pure
 for
 me.
 is
 a
 little


undisiplined,
 is
 a
 little
 ungainainely,


uh
 is
 a
 little
 unrepentant,
 but
 is


absolutely
 the
 one
 closest
 to
 the
 pulse


of
 the
 biography
 of
 Mary
 Shel,
 the
 id
 of


Mary
 Shel.
 And
 I
 read
 it
 and
 I
 I
 what
 I


always
 felt
 is
 the
 creature
 is
 me.
 What


was
 it
 about
 the
 creature
 at
 that
 early


age
 that
 spoke
 to
 you
 in
 in
 such
 a


strong
 way?
 I
 I
 I
 really
 believe
 that
 uh


the
 the
 depth
 of
 of
 fear
 that
 you


experience
 before
 you
 get
 into
 your


teenage
 years
 uh
 is
 the
 most
 profound


fear
 you
 will
 ever
 uh
 feel
 in
 your
 life.


And
 every
 every
 time
 you
 are
 afraid
 or


angry
 or
 full
 of
 rage
 as
 an
 adult
 is


that
 very
 young
 child
 controlling
 you,


feeling
 abandoned
 or
 feeling


apprehensive
 about
 the
 future
 or
 the


world.
 the
 the
 deepest
 questions
 at


least
 me
 being
 raised
 Catholic,
 you


know,
 I
 was
 raised
 by
 partially
 by
 my


great
 aunt
 who
 I
 called
 my
 grandmother


and
 she
 would
 tell
 me,
 "Look,
 you're


going to
 go
 to
 purgatory
 no matter
 what


for
 hundreds
 of
 years
 because
 of


original
 sin."
 And
 I
 and
 I
 thought
 this


is
 like
 time
 share
 but
 for
 the
 soul,
 you


know,
 this
 is
 a
 a
 complete
 scam.
 you


know
 there
 there's
 such
 a
 pageantry
 such


a
 savagery
 to
 Catholicism


>> and
 uh
 at
 11
 the
 questions
 I
 had
 about


the
 world
 were
 very
 profound
 and
 and
 and


Frankenstein
 uh
 the
 book
 downsized
 a
 lot


of
 these
 questions
 uh
 the
 questions
 why


the
 world
 can
 be
 savage
 why
 the
 world


can
 be
 cruel
 why
 how
 can
 we
 be
 cruel
 to


each
 other
 in
 in
 a
 way
 that
 is


even
 now
 hard
 to
 explain
 that's
 why
 he's


a
 singularity.


>> Watching
 your
 movie
 and
 revisiting
 the


book,
 which
 I
 hadn't
 read
 since
 I
 was
 a


teenager.
 Now,
 I
 don't know
 if
 it's
 just


cuz
 I'm
 older,
 but
 the
 loneliness
 of
 it


was
 really
 underscored
 for
 me.
 And
 I
 was


able
 possibly
 in
 a
 way
 I
 wasn't
 as


sophisticated
 as
 you
 as
 an
 11year-old


that
 I
 didn't
 see
 when
 I
 was
 younger.


It's
 just
 he
 is
 so
 lonely.
 He
 is
 the


only
 one
 of
 himself
 out
 there.


>> And
 I
 believe
 that
 was
 Mary
 Shel.


>> How
 how
 so?
 I
 don't
 think
 Mary
 Shelley


felt
 comfortable
 in
 the
 gender
 that
 she


was
 uh
 put
 in
 by
 society.
 I
 think
 she


had
 uh
 the
 spirit
 of
 her
 mother
 which


was
 also
 uh


a
 free
 spirit
 of
 great
 hunger
 for
 the


world.


>> The
 feminist
 writer
 Mary
 Walencraft.


>> Yes.
 and
 and
 and
 you
 know
 she
 she
 had


lived
 uh
 large
 and
 wild
 and
 beautifully


and
 then
 basically
 in
 the
 eyes
 of
 her


father
 William
 Goodwin
 Mary
 kills
 her


and
 and
 in
 fact
 teaches
 her
 to
 read
 on


the
 gravestone
 of
 her
 mother
 you
 know


the
 sort
 of
 crushing
 feeling
 for
 her


that
 she
 is
 motherless
 and
 somewhat


fatherless
 that
 she's
 alone
 in
 the
 world


and
 that
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 key
 for
 me
 I


felt


so
 alone
 at
 age
 11
 and
 so
 full
 of
 um


love
 to
 give
 and
 so
 full
 of
 rage
 to


dispose
 of.
 It
 was
 a
 very
 a
 very


complicated


emotional
 scope
 for
 somebody
 that
 young


and
 and
 this
 you
 know
 some
 people
 find


in
 the
 Bible
 the
 way
 to
 articulate
 their


faith
 and
 their
 existence.
 I
 found
 it
 in


this
 book


>> to
 quote
 maybe
 inappropriately
 Robert


Dairo
 on
 heat
 when
 he
 says
 I
 am
 alone
 I


am
 not
 lonely
 when
 you
 were
 a
 kid
 were


you
 alone
 or
 were
 you
 lonely
 or
 was
 it


both?


>> I
 think
 I
 was
 very
 lonely.


>> And
 why
 was
 that?
 You
 had
 this
 aunt
 or


this
 great
 aunt.
 You
 had


>> other
 family
 members
 but


>> where
 did
 that
 come
 from?
 I
 think
 the


way
 you
 introspect
 the
 world
 uh
 and


where
 you
 put
 it
 and
 how
 do
 you
 shel
 it


and
 and
 and
 how
 it
 affects
 you.
 If
 you


are
 overempathic,


>> if
 you
 are
 if
 you
 are
 um
 if
 you
 take
 the


suffering
 of
 others
 to
 heart
 and
 uh
 you


you
 grow
 up
 with
 a
 much
 more
 somber,


much
 more
 melancholic
 disposition,


you
 know,
 and
 I
 I
 was
 definitely


resonant
 and
 I
 was
 very
 attuned
 to
 the


to
 the
 way
 adults
 told
 you
 the
 way
 the


the
 world
 was
 uh
 not
 being
 truthful.
 you


know
 the
 I
 saw
 the
 lies


um
 I
 saw
 the
 the
 falsehoods.


>> Can
 you
 recall
 a
 moment
 where
 maybe
 it


was
 religion,
 maybe
 it
 was
 something


else
 where
 someone
 an
 adult
 who
 you


trusted
 told
 you
 a
 thing
 and
 then
 you


were
 like
 that
 is
 that
 sorry
 my
 friend


that
 is
 not
 true
 like
 I
 can
 tell
 I
 can


see
 it
 why
 are
 you
 lying
 to
 me?


>> Yeah.
 No.
 Well,
 it
 as
 very
 pointedly
 you


can
 see
 on
 my
 movies,
 it
 started
 with
 my


father.


>> You
 know,
 my
 father
 uh
 you
 know,
 my


father
 won
 the
 lottery
 in
 1969


and
 he
 changed.
 He
 changed
 quite
 a
 bit.


And
 it's
 not
 that
 he
 was
 at
 great
 fault.


Uh
 I'm
 talking
 about
 nuances.


you
 know,


>> he
 was
 by
 all
 accounts
 and
 by
 all


experience
 a
 good
 man,
 but
 he
 was
 not


very
 consistent


>> with
 what
 he
 said
 and
 what
 he
 did.
 And


and
 I
 did
 ask
 him
 and
 he
 said,
 "One


thing
 doesn't
 have
 to
 do
 anything
 with


the
 other,
 which
 which
 was
 marvelous."
 I


said,
 "Father,
 Dad,
 how
 can
 you
 be
 so


Catholic?
 Uh
 you're
 part
 of
 the
 oppos,


you
 know,
 and
 then
 you
 behave
 like


this."


>> Yeah.


>> And
 he
 said,
 "Well,
 one
 thing
 doesn't


have
 to
 do
 charity."
 For
 him,
 charity


existed
 as
 a
 notion
 in
 the
 church.
 You


know,
 you
 gave
 money
 in
 the
 church
 and


that
 was
 charity.
 But
 charity
 to
 your


fellow
 human
 beings
 was
 another
 matter


matter
 altogether.


>> Did
 that
 make
 you
 see
 the
 world
 as
 you


got
 older
 as
 more
 black
 and
 white
 or
 did


you
 did
 you
 understand
 that
 that
 people


people
 are
 contradictory


>> as
 much
 as
 anything?
 I
 actually
 love
 the


fact
 that
 the
 world
 is
 not
 is
 neither


black
 nor
 white
 in
 a
 constant
 way.
 I
 I


think
 the
 flow
 the
 flow
 of
 the
 black
 and


the
 white
 with
 through
 the
 gray
 is
 so


liberating
 to
 understand
 that
 that's
 the


nature
 of
 the
 universe


>> is
 the
 ying
 and
 the
 yang
 revolving


constantly


and
 never
 ending.
 You
 know,
 nothing
 is


permanent.


That
 is
 really
 good.
 And
 what
 I
 didn't


like
 was
 the
 the
 inconsistent
 way
 in


which
 it's
 phrased.


The
 nature
 of
 the
 world
 puzzled
 me
 less


than
 the
 declarations
 the
 adults
 made


about
 what
 the
 world
 was,
 you
 know.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 I
 think
 when
 you
 when
 you


realize
 the
 entire
 nature
 of
 the
 world


is
 the
 paradox


uh
 we
 exist
 in
 a
 paradoxical
 state
 and


anything
 we
 want
 to
 become
 permanent
 or


safe
 or
 good
 or
 bad
 quote
 unquote
 uh
 is


a
 tantrum


a
 tantrum
 of
 the
 soul.
 Uh
 and
 that's


that's
 the
 answer
 that
 I
 found
 at
 a
 at


an
 early
 age
 on
 the
 book
 of
 Job
 when
 Job


says
 to
 God
 why
 me?


Why
 this?
 And
 the
 answer
 God
 gives
 him


is
 why
 not


you
 know
 it's
 it's
 really
 really
 you


know
 uh
 phenomenal
 to
 find
 that
 at
 an


early
 age
 and
 and
 and
 I
 did
 I
 was
 I
 was


raised
 in
 in
 Jesuit
 school.


>> Mhm.
 So
 uh
 we
 had
 a
 spiritual
 counselor


and
 I
 was
 very
 close
 to
 several
 priests


growing
 up.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 asked
 these


questions
 of
 them.
 I
 really
 I
 really


asked
 the
 questions
 of
 uh
 my
 my
 ethic


and
 spiritual
 advisor
 in
 Jesuit
 school.


I
 said
 I
 wanted
 to
 discuss
 the
 book
 of


Job
 so
 urgently.
 He
 just
 said
 well
 God


made
 the
 world
 in
 you
 know
 in
 a
 world
 in


a
 way
 that
 we
 don't
 have
 to
 understand.


And
 I
 I
 I
 that
 didn't
 satisfy
 me.
 I
 I
 I


I I
 found
 more
 answers
 later
 on
 in
 the


Dao,
 you
 know,
 as
 a
 younger
 man.


>> And
 the
 fact


>> that
 seems
 that
 seems
 deficient
 on
 that


priest's
 part.
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 I
 went


to
 a
 Jesuit
 college.
 The
 Jesuits
 are


supposed
 to
 be
 smarter
 than
 this.


>> They
 they they they


you
 know,
 the
 the
 great
 thing
 about
 the


Dao,
 he
 it
 phrases
 it
 very
 much
 more


beautifully.
 He
 says,
 "He
 who
 tries
 to


use
 the
 tools
 of
 the
 master
 basically


will
 cut
 himself."
 You
 know,


>> uh
 they
 are
 not
 tools
 that
 you
 can


handle.
 And
 and
 I
 understand
 the
 tools


that
 make
 the
 world
 and
 and
 and
 that


make
 the
 world
 that


>> uh
 so
 full
 of
 paradox.
 The
 day
 you
 marry


and
 are
 and
 celebrate
 is
 the
 day


somebody
 got
 run
 over
 by
 a
 car.
 Is
 the


day
 somebody
 lost
 a
 son?
 Is
 the
 day


somebody
 gave
 birth
 to
 a
 daughter?
 I


mean
 that's
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 world.
 And


I
 understand
 that
 easier
 through
 through


that
 phrasing.


>> I
 feel
 like
 if
 you're
 not
 using
 the
 the


tools
 of
 the
 master,
 if
 you're
 not
 using


the
 text
 that
 you
 were
 given
 as
 a
 child


in
 order
 to
 make
 sense
 of
 the
 world,
 it


feels
 like
 art
 and
 specifically
 when
 you


were
 younger
 books
 and
 literature
 is
 a


way
 that
 you
 came
 to
 understand
 the


world,
 came
 to
 your
 own
 understanding
 of


the
 world.
 Yeah.
 And
 I'm
 just
 curious


how


how
 did
 that
 start?
 Where
 how
 did
 you


become
 a
 reader?
 How
 did
 you
 realize


that
 this
 was
 the
 way
 that
 you
 were


going
 to
 start
 to
 make
 sense
 of
 how


everything
 was?


>> In
 1969,
 when
 my
 father
 won
 the
 lottery,


I
 was
 5
 years
 old.
 as
 part
 of
 his
 new
 uh


life
 as
 a
 gentle
 man,
 gentleman.
 Uh
 he


bought
 a
 library
 and
 he
 it
 was
 full
 of


basic
 literature,
 a
 children's
 classics,


quote
 unquote,
 an
 encyclopedia
 of


health,
 an
 encyclopedia
 of
 art,
 uh
 two


encyclopedias
 of
 general
 knowledge.
 So


at
 age
 five,
 I
 started
 to
 five
 or
 six,
 I


started
 to
 wander
 into
 the
 library
 more


and
 more
 and
 I
 started
 reading
 really


fast.
 I
 I
 was
 completely
 bilingual
 at


age
 seven.
 I
 read
 the
 entire
 library
 in


a
 couple
 of
 years
 and
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 the


books
 were
 very
 dark.


uh
 uh
 that
 he
 had
 a
 collection
 of
 uh


Latin
 American
 writers
 and
 uh
 some


Mexican
 writers
 and
 I
 read
 all
 of
 Oscar


Wild
 and
 I
 read
 uh
 Victor
 Hugo's
 uh


Notredam
 and
 Lemis
 and
 Monte
 Cristo
 and


etc
 etc
 etc
 and
 I
 and
 I
 realized
 this


was
 a
 way
 to
 communicate
 with
 the
 world


just
 as
 comic
 books
 were
 art
 was.
 So
 I


discovered
 health,
 uh,
 biology,
 the


history
 of
 art,
 all
 all
 of
 it
 at
 the


same
 time.
 It
 was
 a
 tumultuous,
 uh,


time.
 That
 library
 was
 my
 gateway
 into


into
 words
 and
 images.


>> That's
 incredible.
 Do
 you
 still
 have
 any


of
 those
 books?


>> Yes,
 I
 have
 them
 right
 behind
 me.


>> The
 your
 the
 original
 books
 that
 you


read
 when
 you
 were
 seven?


>> Yeah,
 the
 encyclopedia
 of
 art
 is
 behind


me.


That's
 amazing
 because
 I
 think
 most
 kids


uh
 whether
 it's
 comic
 books
 or
 the
 books


that
 they
 were
 raised
 with
 uh
 find
 that


uh
 their
 parents
 end
 up
 tossing
 them
 in


in
 some
 fashion


>> that
 that
 that
 happened
 to
 me
 with
 my


comic
 books
 with
 my
 mother
 and
 she


burned
 them.
 She
 didn't
 she
 didn't
 just


toss
 them,
 she
 burned
 them.
 Uh


>> she
 she
 burned
 them.
 She
 actually
 in


like
 a
 fireplace.


>> No,
 no,
 no.
 In
 a
 in
 an
 empty
 lot
 next
 to


the
 house.
 She
 said,
 "Oh,
 take
 all
 this


stuff
 and
 burn
 it."
 She
 said
 to
 to


>> oh
 my
 god


>> the
 gardener
 you
 know
 he
 she
 said
 take


all
 this
 and
 burn
 it
 so
 she
 could


organize
 my
 socks
 on
 my
 garage.


>> But
 you
 know
 uh
 th
 those
 were
 formative


years
 because
 movies
 were
 already
 an


obsession


>> and
 I
 was
 reading
 comic
 books.
 I
 I
 was


very
 very
 familiar
 with
 Neil
 Adams,
 Jack


Kirby,


>> you
 know,
 uh
 Steve
 Ditkco,
 all
 the
 comic


book
 artists
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time
 I
 was


becoming
 familiar
 with
 Goya,
 Manet,


Monet,
 Dega,
 you
 know,
 uh
 everything
 had


the
 same
 value
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time
 I


became
 a
 a
 a
 very
 knowledgeable
 and


young
 hypochondric.


I
 I
 I
 I
 knew
 about
 cerosis,
 tinosis,


uh
 glaucoma,
 high
 blood
 pressure,


diabetes,
 you
 name
 it.
 And
 uh
 and
 to


this
 day,
 I'm
 I'm
 you
 can
 see
 it
 on
 my


movies.
 I
 have
 an
 obsession
 with
 biology


that
 comes
 from
 those
 year.


All
 of
 these
 building
 blocks
 led
 to
 the


writer,
 director,
 creative
 artist
 that


you
 are
 right
 now.
 It
 sounds
 like
 a
 lot


of
 hardship
 was
 involved.
 However,


around
 all
 of
 that
 is
 there,
 you
 can't


imagine
 a
 world
 in
 which
 none
 of
 this


happened,
 but
 is
 it
 do
 you
 ever
 think
 I


wish
 I
 was
 less
 lonely
 as
 a
 child
 and
 I


would
 be
 okay
 with
 being
 less
 creative?


Like,
 have
 you
 ever
 thought
 about
 how


one
 led
 to
 the
 other
 and
 the
 tradeoffs?


>> Well,
 they're
 they're
 in
 indivisible.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 know,
 uh
 Truman
 Truman
 Kaporti


famously
 said,
 you
 get
 a
 gift
 and
 a
 whip


at
 the
 same
 time.


>> Yeah.


>> To
 have
 is
 to
 fear.
 To
 desire
 is
 to


fear.


There
 is
 no
 no
 way
 to
 be
 a
 father


without
 feeling
 fear


for
 for
 the
 well-being
 of
 your
 of
 your


uh
 children.
 You
 know,
 there's
 no
 way
 to


be
 in
 love
 without
 having
 the
 bang
 of
 uh


fear
 that
 you
 one
 day
 may
 lose
 it.
 You


know,
 it
 it
 is
 the
 nature
 of


the
 cosmos
 to
 to
 to
 receive
 both.


After
 the
 break,
 GMO
 talks
 about
 turning


the
 story
 he
 loved
 all
 his
 life
 into
 an


Oscar
 nominated
 screenplay.


Let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 that


screenplay.
 Talk
 to
 me
 about
 when
 you


first
 started,
 you
 literally
 the
 first


day
 you
 started
 writing
 this.
 What
 was


the
 first
 scene?
 Was
 it
 about
 structure?


Was
 it
 a
 character?
 Was
 it
 dialogue?
 How


did
 you
 start?


>> The
 first
 thing
 I
 I
 I
 I
 did
 start
 with


the
 beginning
 because
 I
 wanted
 to
 I


wanted
 I
 knew
 I
 wanted
 to
 show
 a
 very


violent
 attack
 of
 the
 creature
 to
 the


ship
 and
 I
 wanted
 the
 audience
 to
 say,


"Well,
 I
 had
 never
 seen
 this
 before."
 Uh


and
 and
 to
 find
 the
 creature
 monstrous


and
 reprehensible
 and
 savage.
 And
 then
 I


knew
 after
 going
 through
 the
 whole


movie,
 you
 would
 understand.
 You
 would


come
 back
 to
 that
 moment
 and
 realize,


oh,
 that's
 why
 that
 violence
 occurred.


So
 you
 would
 understand
 the
 other
 side


at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 movie.
 That
 was
 my


hope.
 And
 then
 I
 knew
 I
 wanted
 to
 create


this
 sort
 of
 um
 almost
 imaginary


childhood
 for
 Victor
 in
 which
 he
 was


already


quite
 an
 atrocious
 mama's
 boy,
 you
 know.


And
 and
 because
 he
 felt
 slighted.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 he
 would
 feel
 the
 old
 the
 world
 owed


him.
 We
 are
 now
 in
 an
 era
 in
 which
 we


can
 see


many
 of
 the
 most
 powerful
 men
 are


manchildren


that
 feel
 the
 world
 owes
 them
 something


that
 we
 are
 all
 paying
 for
 you
 know
 and


I
 felt
 that
 was
 that
 felt
 very
 alive.
 I


wanted
 it
 to
 feel
 alive
 in
 the
 way
 that


the
 novel
 felt
 alive
 when
 Mary
 Shelley


published
 it.
 you
 know,
 it
 felt
 as
 of
 as


of
 now.
 Uh,
 modern


loomed
 very
 large.
 And
 as
 I
 went
 into


the
 adaptation,
 I
 I
 I
 knew
 the
 romantics


were
 and
 are
 modern.
 These
 were
 people


that
 took
 the
 savor
 and
 went
 to
 war
 and


galloped
 through
 Waterlue
 and
 and
 when


they
 gave
 recital,
 they
 were
 the
 the


tool
 of
 the
 devil.
 uh
 inflaming
 passions


in
 young
 hearts
 and
 uh
 being
 in
 favor
 of


death
 and
 love
 being
 fused
 into
 one.
 All


of
 these
 things
 started
 to
 percolate
 and


I
 and
 I
 I
 wanted
 to
 encompass
 the


romantic
 spirit
 and
 the
 and
 the


loneliness
 that
 comes
 with
 it
 and
 the


doom
 the
 sense
 of
 doom
 and
 hope
 and
 uh


that
 comes
 with
 it
 and
 the
 sense
 of


graveyard
 poetry
 that
 comes
 with
 it.
 So


all
 these
 things
 occupied
 my
 mind
 and


that's
 why
 when
 we
 got
 when
 we
 started


this
 campaign
 for
 this
 movie
 I
 said
 the


only
 nomination
 that
 I
 really
 desire
 is


best
 adapted
 screenplay
 because
 it
 I


have
 written
 so
 much
 uh
 for
 decades
 and


this
 is
 the
 screenplay
 I'm
 the
 proudest


of.


>> God
 I
 have
 so
 many
 questions
 now
 about


the
 romantics
 but
 we're
 going
 to
 move


on.
 You
 um
 said
 this
 is
 the
 screenplay


that
 you
 are
 most
 proud
 of.
 you
 have


>> uh
 written
 screenplays
 for
 all
 of
 your


films
 and
 as
 you
 said
 you've
 you've


written
 many
 more
 that
 have
 gone


unproduced.


>> Just
 tell
 me
 why
 you're
 so
 proud
 of
 this


one.


>> One
 of
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 found
 uh


people
 that
 think
 they
 know
 the
 book
 and


that's
 an
 illusion
 that
 happens
 often


with
 those
 characters
 that
 are
 so
 large.


People
 think
 they
 know
 Pinocchio.
 People


think
 they
 know
 Dracula.
 People
 think


they
 know
 Frankenstein.
 People
 think


they
 know
 Monte
 Cristo.
 But
 the


mechanics
 that
 made
 the
 books
 what
 they


are
 uh
 escaped
 them.
 I
 think
 that
 uh
 one


of
 the
 things
 I
 wanted
 to
 do
 was
 to
 I


knew
 I
 was
 going
 to
 generate
 90%
 new


dialogue.


>> Uh
 but
 I
 wanted
 to
 feel
 of
 a
 piece
 with


the
 book.
 So
 to
 learn
 I
 read
 for
 example


volumes
 of
 letters


from
 the
 nu
 1800s
 there's
 a
 ptoa
 and
 a


cadence
 and
 a
 and
 and and
 and
 a
 a
 a


style
 to
 the
 language
 that
 takes
 quite
 a


while
 to
 to
 try
 to
 condense
 and
 then
 you


can
 say
 things
 to
 you
 I
 am
 obscene
 but


to
 myself
 I
 simply
 am
 you
 know
 which
 to


me
 is
 a
 very
 concussive
 statement.
 And


the
 the
 the
 language
 of
 the
 movie
 has
 to


be
 a
 little
 more
 stylized
 and
 and
 and


elevated
 or
 oporatic
 or
 uh
 there
 are


conscious
 choices
 that
 that
 require
 a


lot
 of
 work
 when
 you're
 writing
 dialogue


given
 that
 you're
 trying
 to
 achieve
 um


this
 uh
 sort
 of
 Shellyleyesque
 pto
 as


you
 said.
 How
 do
 you
 know
 that
 the


rhythm
 is
 right?
 because
 I
 it
 feels
 like


it's
 as
 much
 about
 rhythm
 as
 it
 is
 about


words.


>> Uh
 I
 have
 I've
 been
 a
 screenplay
 writer


for
 about
 30
 years
 and
 uh
 the
 rhythms
 I


have
 as
 a
 native
 speaker
 which
 come
 from


Latin
 languages,
 right?


>> Are
 very
 are
 very
 um
 melodic
 and
 long.


Uh
 uh
 English
 tends
 to
 be
 very


percussive,


you
 know.
 A
 modern
 English
 certainly
 has


the
 ratat
 of
 Hemingway.
 You
 know,
 a
 a


whole
 paragraph
 in
 Spanish
 can
 be
 said


in
 English
 in
 four
 words.


You
 know,
 it's
 is
 very
 concussive.
 It's


very
 percussive.
 It's
 very
 rhythmic.
 And


19th
 century
 um
 uh
 dialogue
 is
 a
 mixture


of
 both.


>> You
 know,
 it
 has
 a
 certain
 rhythm,


>> you
 know.
 Nobody
 says,
 "Can
 I
 have
 a


piece
 of
 toast?"


They
 they
 would
 say,
 "I
 hesitate
 to
 ask,


but
 if
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 too
 much
 trouble,


may
 I
 partake
 of
 a
 piece
 of
 your
 toast?"


In
 a
 way.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 there's
 a
 tentative
 quaintness
 and


at
 the
 same
 time
 clarity.


>> Yeah.
 Do
 you
 um
 do
 you
 write
 dialogue


only
 in
 English?


>> No.
 No.
 I
 have
 only
 written
 three
 uh


three
 movies
 in
 in
 Spanish,
 you
 know,
 uh


the
 chrono,
 rebels
 back
 when
 I'm
 panin,


but
 I
 I
 I
 love
 it's
 so
 it's
 like
 I'm


bolt


in
 Spanish.
 Uh
 in
 English,
 in
 English,
 I


have
 to
 ponder
 and
 ponder
 and
 and
 move


things
 around.
 I
 mean
 when
 you
 write
 on


a
 second
 language


uh
 you're
 very
 aware
 of
 of
 the
 the
 haiku


uh
 brevity
 of
 of
 uh
 of
 how
 much
 one


syllable
 weights
 in
 the
 second
 language.


That's
 why
 I
 can
 read
 in
 French
 fluently


but
 I
 cannot
 write
 in
 French.
 is
 it's


it's
 a
 mystery
 and
 there
 alien
 music
 to


me
 but
 it's
 exquisite
 but
 you
 you
 cannot


it's
 very
 hard
 to
 master
 languages
 to


the
 point
 of
 trying
 to
 write
 in
 them.
 I


would
 like
 to
 get
 um
 we're
 coming
 up
 on


our
 on
 our
 buy
 the
 book
 segment
 where


I'm
 just
 going
 to
 ask
 you
 a
 bunch
 of


sort
 of
 quick
 questions
 about
 stuff


you're
 reading.
 Uh
 but
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 you


about
 the
 ending
 here,
 right?
 If
 we're


talking
 about
 adaptation,
 if
 we're


talking
 about,
 as
 you
 put
 in
 another


interview,
 transmutation,
 you
 know,
 the


ending
 of
 Shel's
 book
 is
 quite
 stark.


The
 captain


>> Yeah.


>> uh
 of
 the
 ship
 enters
 his
 cabin.
 He


discovers
 the
 creature
 standing
 over


Frankenstein's
 lifeless
 body.
 In
 your


version,


>> they
 have
 an
 exchange.
 Frankenstein
 and


his
 creature,
 Frankenstein
 and
 the
 thing


he
 created
 um
 talk
 and
 there's


forgiveness,
 there's
 understanding,


there's
 a
 reconciliation.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 why
 did
 you
 feel
 like
 that
 was
 the


truest
 way
 for
 your
 version
 of
 the
 story


to
 end?
 In
 my
 in
 my
 opinion,
 the
 the


dialogue
 that
 occurs
 in
 the
 cabin
 in


this
 version
 is
 a
 dialogue
 that
 occurs


in
 the
 eyes
 between
 the
 creature
 and


Victor,
 you
 know,


>> earlier
 in
 the
 book.


>> Earlier
 in
 the
 book,
 uh
 where
 he
 tells


him,
 look,
 this
 is
 what
 happened
 to
 me.


And
 uh
 to
 me,
 the
 radical
 thing
 to
 do
 in


the
 romantic
 times
 was
 to
 end
 up
 in
 a


almost
 protoexistentialist
 way.
 in
 which


the
 creature
 is
 born
 by
 the
 current
 and


the
 distance
 into
 nothing.
 You
 know,
 uh


that
 is
 a
 very
 uh
 a
 beautiful
 nailism


nailism,
 you
 know.
 It's
 like
 a
 a
 very


powerful


uh


very
 very
 counter
 to
 what
 was
 invogue
 in


the
 world,
 you
 know.
 um
 therefore
 very


anarctic
 and
 and
 to
 me
 right
 now
 the


radical
 position


uh
 is
 grace


you
 know
 uh
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 uh
 we
 tend


to
 believe
 that
 forgiveness
 is
 very


elaborate


but
 I
 think
 forgiveness


is
 actually
 grace


we
 want
 to
 forgive
 and
 we
 want
 to
 be


forgiven


we
 really
 long
 for


And
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 radical


position
 for
 me.
 Now
 uh
 one
 of
 the


things
 I
 decided
 very
 much
 so
 is
 if
 I


have


fused
 through
 the
 decades
 with
 the


spirit
 of
 the
 book
 and
 how


autobiographical


it
 was
 for
 Mary
 Shel
 I
 believe
 to
 write


this
 book.
 It
 was
 all
 her


rephrasing
 her
 life.
 I
 decided
 I
 would


rephrase
 my
 experience
 as
 a
 father
 and


my
 experience
 as
 a
 son.
 And
 the
 ending


has
 a
 very
 strong
 tie


with
 my
 own
 life,
 you
 know,
 and
 uh
 and


that
 is
 to
 accept
 the
 grace
 and
 the


rhythms
 of
 the
 world


to
 accept,
 you
 know,
 the
 movie
 starts


with
 the
 sun
 rising


>> and
 the
 captain
 turning
 his
 back
 to
 it


and
 it
 ends
 with
 the
 creature
 facing
 the


sun
 and
 accepting
 it.
 abandon
 him
 him


himself
 to
 to
 that
 current.
 It's
 a


different
 current
 than
 the
 current
 that


Shel
 portrayed
 in
 the
 ending,
 but
 it


felt
 like
 look,
 if
 I
 am
 to
 sing
 this


song,
 I'll
 sing
 it
 with
 my
 voice.


>> You
 know,
 at
 the
 um
 I
 think
 it
 was
 at


Ken
 uh
 when
 they
 premiered
 Sentimental


Value,
 Wim
 Trier
 said
 something
 like


kindness
 is
 the
 new
 punk
 rock
 or


tenderness
 is
 the
 new
 punk
 rock.


>> You
 also
 saw
 it
 in
 Last
 Summer
 Superman.


The
 idea
 that
 in
 times
 like
 these


actually
 the
 radical
 thing
 is
 to
 be


nice,
 is
 to
 be
 kind,
 is
 to
 forgive.


Yeah.


>> Is
 to
 forge
 some
 sort
 of
 understanding


between
 people.


>> I
 think
 I
 I
 think
 I
 I
 I
 preeded
 it
 a
 few


years
 ago
 saying
 emotion
 is
 the
 new
 punk


>> and
 and and
 I
 I
 sustain
 it
 because


here's
 the
 thing.
 Grace
 and
 hope
 in


ignorance
 have
 no
 value.


But
 grace
 and
 hope
 with
 the
 knowledge


of
 the
 world
 and
 how
 it
 is
 is
 radical.


Uh
 you
 are
 not
 doing
 it
 out
 of


ignorance.
 You're
 doing
 it
 as
 a


conscientious
 objector
 to
 the
 world,
 you


know,


>> and
 and
 I
 think
 then
 they
 have
 a


different
 uh
 weight
 and
 gravity.


When
 we
 come
 back,
 GMO
 answers
 some
 of


our
 buy
 the
 book
 questions.


>> GMO,
 as
 we
 approach
 the
 end
 of
 our


conversation
 here,
 uh,
 I'm
 going
 to


swerve
 back
 to
 books.
 Your
 love,
 my


love.
 What
 have


>> for
 more
 than
 a
 decade
 every
 week
 the


New
 York
 Times
 book
 review
 has
 asked


authors
 a
 recurring
 set
 of
 questions


about
 their
 reading
 as
 part
 of
 a
 series


that
 we
 call
 buy
 the
 book.
 I
 have
 a


feeling
 that
 you
 above
 all
 people
 are


going
 to
 have
 some
 very
 interesting


answers.
 Um
 what
 is
 the
 best
 book
 that


you've
 ever
 either
 received
 or
 given
 as


a
 gift?
 I
 would
 say
 the
 the
 Dao
 in
 the


translation
 of
 Stephen
 Mitchell


>> uh
 is
 one
 of
 is
 one
 of
 the
 books
 I
 I


love
 to
 I
 discovered
 and
 I
 love
 to
 give


and
 uh
 another
 great
 book
 I
 think
 it's


called
 Wabby
 Sabi
 for
 artists


you
 know
 I
 love
 to
 give
 that
 uh
 that
 I


have
 received
 um


that
 you


I
 think
 um
 that


almost
 nobody
 dares
 to
 buy
 me
 books


but
 uh
 I
 would
 I
 would
 say
 I
 would
 say


there's
 a
 really
 good
 book
 that
 is


called
 Navok's
 butterflies


which
 is
 is
 a
 collection
 of
 miscellaneia


>> and
 I
 think
 Nabokov
 uh
 had
 a
 fascination


with
 entomology
 and
 uh
 uh
 you
 know


particularly
 fascinated
 by
 butterflies,


but
 it
 collects
 loose
 loose
 uh
 pieces


that
 I
 find
 very
 compelling,
 a
 lot
 more


compelling
 than
 than
 his
 uh


>> organized
 studies
 of
 literature,
 for


example.


>> Are
 there
 any
 classic
 novels
 that
 you


only
 just
 recently
 discovered
 or
 read


for
 the
 first
 time?
 As
 a
 young
 reader,
 I


have
 difficulty
 finishing
 movie.


>> Hey
 man,
 you're
 not
 the
 first.


>> Whenever
 whenever
 you
 hit
 the
 whailing


passages
 as
 a
 young
 reader,
 I
 said,


"Well,


I
 I
 would
 be
 completely
 shipwrecked


in
 that."
 And
 now
 uh
 like
 recently,


you
 know,
 like
 a
 few
 years
 ago,
 I


finished
 it
 and
 the
 whailing
 passages


became
 my
 favorite.


And
 uh
 and
 uh
 and
 I
 I I
 realize
 how
 much


you
 change
 as
 a
 as
 a
 reader.


>> This
 is
 a
 classic
 journey
 with
 Moby


Dick.
 I
 it
 feels
 like
 everyone
 tries
 to


start
 it
 at
 some
 point.
 They
 bail.
 They


say
 there's
 too
 much
 about
 spermaceti
 um


and
 then
 when
 they
 actually
 get
 to
 it


and
 get
 through
 it.
 Yeah.


>> It
 is
 the
 detailoriented
 nature
 of
 the


description
 of
 how
 you
 take
 a
 whale
 and


bo
 and
 do
 all
 the
 stuff
 that
 people
 fall


in
 love
 with.


>> Yeah.


Is
 there
 one
 book
 that
 you
 would
 be
 okay


with
 never
 being
 adapted
 into
 film
 or


never
 being
 adapted
 again
 into
 film?


>> I
 think
 a
 guy
 that
 is
 very
 hard
 to
 adapt


but
 very
 rewarding
 is
 really
 Bradbury.


>> Bradbury
 his
 style
 is
 fools
 you
 as


something
 you
 can
 past.


you
 know,
 he's
 he
 he
 he
 the
 way
 he
 uses


adjectives
 in
 an
 evocative
 way
 seems
 to


be
 something
 that
 you
 can
 do,
 quote


unquote,
 you
 can,
 you
 know,
 and
 when


you're
 a
 young
 writer,
 you
 say,
 well,


I'm
 going
 to
 write
 in
 the
 style
 of,


yeah,
 sure.


>> It's
 so
 funny
 that
 you
 say
 that
 about


Bradberry.
 just
 follow
 up
 there
 because


I


>> you
 know
 I've
 read
 something
 wicked
 this


way
 comes
 me
 many
 times
 and
 I
 actually


tried
 to
 read
 it
 again
 to
 my
 child
 and


it
 was
 just
 not
 the
 right
 point
 like
 the


language
 is
 was
 actually
 sort
 of
 more


fluid
 and
 and
 sentimental
 than
 I
 recall


even
 though
 I
 love
 that
 book
 and
 and
 I


remember
 seeing


>> finally
 on
 the
 big
 screen
 um
 the
 the


Jack
 Clayton
 film
 and
 and and
 thinking


about
 how


>> that
 film
 was
 trying
 to
 capture
 the
 the


tone,
 the
 language,
 the
 style
 and
 and


and
 it
 didn't
 succeed
 in
 many
 parts
 ex


it
 succeeded
 um
 you
 know
 with
 Jonathan


Price's
 character
 and
 some
 but
 but
 the


the
 nostalgia
 the
 the
 sort
 of
 like


sepiaone
 nature
 of
 that
 book
 is
 almost


impossible
 to
 to
 capture
 without
 feeling


like


>> like
 a
 ripoff
 of
 the
 natural
 or


something.
 You
 know
 Ray
 Bradberry
 is


very
 difficult.
 Um
 I
 have
 to
 ask
 this
 I


have
 to
 ask
 this
 question.
 I
 is
 it
 true


that
 the
 first
 movie
 that
 you
 ever
 saw


or
 that
 you
 recall
 seeing
 was
 the


Lawrence
 Olivier
 version
 of
 Weathering


Heights?


>> 100%.


>> Uh
 so
 how
 does
 it
 feel
 that
 your


creature
 is
 now
 Heathcliffe?


>> Believe
 it
 or
 not
 is
 full
 circle
 for
 me


because
 I
 saw
 it
 with
 my
 mother
 in
 in
 a


cinema
 downtown
 that
 is
 now
 a
 parking


lot.
 Uh-huh.


>> Uh
 and
 and
 and
 uh
 I
 remember
 falling


there's
 something
 very
 victory


childhood.
 I
 fell
 asleep
 on
 my
 mother's


lap
 and
 I
 woke
 up
 to
 a
 storm,
 you
 know,


in
 the
 moors
 or
 something
 very
 dramatic


and
 uh
 and
 and
 I
 think
 it
 made
 me
 who
 I


am.
 So
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 creature
 is
 is


now
 in
 eyes
 is


in
 the
 best
 word
 synthetically


uh
 powerful.
 Well,
 I
 have
 to
 tell
 you,


Jacob
 Alorti
 looks
 uh
 gorgeous
 in
 both


both
 films.
 So,


>> yeah.
 And
 the
 the
 the
 beauty
 about
 Jacob


is
 I
 think
 how
 much
 he
 reveals
 by


wearing
 makeup
 in
 in
 Frankenstein.
 He


can
 open
 himself
 to
 a
 vulnerability
 that


I
 don't
 think
 existed
 before
 in
 his
 in


his
 filming
 work.
 And
 I'm
 very
 curious


about
 Wthering
 Heights.
 I
 haven't
 seen


it
 yet.


>> Yeah.
 Um,
 GMO
 del
 Toro,
 thank
 you
 so


very
 much
 for
 joining
 the
 book
 review.


This
 has
 been
 just
 an
 absolute
 delight.


>> No,
 thank
 you.
 It
 was
 a
 pleasure.
 It


went
 by
 really
 quick.


>> That
 is
 the
 best
 compliment
 anyone
 can


get.


>> How's
 it
 going?
 Thank
 you,
 man.


>> All
 right,
 man.
 Good
 luck.
 Have
 a
 great


rest
 of
 your
 Oscar
 run
 here.
