Hello,
 I'm
 Gilbert
 [music]
 Cruz,
 editor


of
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 book
 review
 and


this
 is
 the
 book
 review
 podcast.
 [music]


It
 is
 time.
 It's
 time
 for
 our
 best
 books


of
 the
 year
 episode.
 [music]
 How
 many


books?
 We
 have
 10
 books
 as
 we
 do
 every


year.
 Five
 fiction,
 five
 non-fiction.


This
 is
 going
 to
 be
 an
 extra
 full


episode.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 like
 a
 double


stuffed
 Oreo
 of
 book
 conversation.


[music]


Later
 on,
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 joined
 by


several
 editors
 to
 talk
 about
 our


non-fiction
 books
 of
 the
 year,
 but
 we


are
 going
 to
 start
 with
 Dave
 Kim
 and


Juman
 [music]
 Katib
 here
 to
 talk
 about


the
 best
 fiction
 of
 the
 year.
 Dave,


welcome.


>> Hello,
 Gilbert.
 Hi,


>> Jima.
 Hello.


>> Hello.
 So
 last
 year
 when
 we
 did
 this


episode,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 recall,
 but


the
 three
 of
 us
 had
 been
 at
 the
 National


Book
 Awards
 the
 night
 before
 and
 we're


feeling
 very
 hazy.


>> Yes.


>> Our
 energy
 level
 was
 much
 lower.


>> Hopefully
 we
 are
 going
 to
 hit
 a
 higher


note
 today.


>> I
 think
 so.


>> Okay,
 good.
 So
 we
 have
 five
 books
 on


this
 list
 and
 before
 we
 start
 our


conversation
 in
 earnest,
 I'm
 going
 to


read
 off
 the
 titles
 and
 the
 authors


here.
 They
 are
 as
 follows.
 The


Loneliness
 of
 Sonia
 and
 Sunny
 by
 Kieran


Desai.
 The
 Sisters
 by
 Yonas
 Hassan


Kamiri.
 Angel
 Down
 by
 Daniel
 Krauss.
 The


Director
 by
 Daniel
 Kelman.
 And
 Stonyard


devotional
 by
 Charlotte
 Wood.
 Jima,
 I


would
 love
 for
 you
 to
 start
 with
 one
 of


the
 earliest
 books
 that
 we
 discuss
 this


year.
 Listeners,
 for
 those
 of
 you
 who


don't
 know,
 this
 is
 a
 year-long
 process.


We
 start
 essentially
 in
 January,
 even
 a


little
 bit
 before
 January
 looking
 ahead


because
 we
 get
 advanced
 copies
 and


galleys
 at
 books
 that
 are
 coming
 out
 and


we
 meet
 every
 month
 and
 then
 every
 week


to
 debate
 and
 discuss.
 Stoneyard


devotional
 by
 Charlotte
 Wood
 was
 early


on
 in
 the
 year.
 Shimani,
 you
 were
 a
 big


fan
 of
 this.
 Tell
 us
 about
 it.


>> I
 read
 this
 book
 actually
 over
 a
 year


ago
 because
 it
 was
 shortlisted
 for
 the


Booker
 and
 it
 hadn't
 yet
 come
 out
 in
 the


States.
 So
 I
 felt
 like
 somebody
 in
 the


department
 should
 read
 it
 in
 case
 it
 won


and
 I
 was
 totally
 bowled
 over.
 So
 this


is
 the
 story
 of
 uh
 a
 woman
 in
 midlife


and
 she
 goes
 back
 to
 the
 area
 of


Australia
 where
 she's
 from
 and
 she
 goes


to
 the
 really
 remote
 plains
 of
 New
 South


Wales
 and
 she
 goes
 to
 visit
 a
 convent.


This
 is
 a
 surprising
 choice.
 She's
 not


particularly
 religious,
 although
 she
 has


a
 very
 active
 spirituality.
 She
 actually


is
 extremely
 against
 the
 Catholic
 Church


and
 its
 quote
 unquote
 savagery
 to
 use


her
 term.
 And
 basically,
 she
 walked
 away


from
 a
 full
 rich
 life,
 a
 marriage,
 a


job,
 friends
 in
 Sydney.
 And
 she
 had
 one


stint
 and
 was
 really
 lulled
 into
 this


sense
 of
 retreat
 that
 she
 needed.
 and


then
 she
 ends
 up
 staying
 for
 much
 much


longer.
 So
 this
 novel
 is
 structured


really
 like
 its
 title
 like
 a
 devotional.


So
 it
 reads
 almost
 like
 a
 a
 diary
 or
 a


chronicle.
 And
 you
 know
 for
 a
 convent


there
 actually
 is
 quite
 a
 bit
 of
 action


that
 happens.
 There
 are
 three
 main


events
 or
 three
 main
 arrivals
 and
 I


think
 that
 those
 are
 felt
 much
 more


keenly
 just
 because
 a
 convent
 by


definition
 is
 really
 cloistered.
 So
 any


kind
 of
 interpolation
 is
 is
 jarring.
 So


first
 there
 is
 a
 horrific
 mouse


infestation.


I
 mean
 it's
 it's
 biblical.
 They're


everywhere.
 There's
 a
 crazy
 scene
 about


mice
 under
 the
 not
 under
 the
 hood
 on
 the


piano
 strings
 playing
 this
 demented


music
 that's
 haunting
 and
 has
 stayed


with
 me
 literally
 for
 13
 months.
 And


this
 really
 forces
 the
 sisters
 to
 think


about
 or
 reconsider
 their
 commitment
 to


doing
 no
 harm
 because
 there
 comes
 a


point
 where
 you've
 got
 thousands
 of
 mice


and
 you
 can't
 really
 let
 them
 run


ramshod
 over
 your
 convent.


>> Does
 this
 resonate
 with
 you
 as
 the


occupant
 of
 multiple
 New
 York
 City


apartments?


>> This
 was
 really
 good
 exposure
 therapy


for
 me.
 I
 will
 tell
 you.
 [laughter]
 I've


I've
 made
 my
 piece
 with
 roaches.


Roaches,
 I
 think,
 are
 almost
 respectful


in
 terms
 of
 vermin.
 Mice
 are
 anything


but.
 And
 rats,
 I
 don't
 acknowledge.


>> I
 absolutely
 disagree.
 Roaches
 are


gross.
 And


>> no,
 they
 usually
 get
 out.


>> I'm
 still
 terrified
 by
 Listen,
 you
 turn


on
 the
 light,
 they
 get
 out.
 They're
 not


>> Say
 please
 and
 thank
 [laughter]
 you.


>> Right.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 just
 useful
 to


know
 what
 you're
 going
 into.
 One
 thing


that
 I
 think
 is
 incredibly
 important
 to


keep
 in
 mind
 when
 you're
 reading
 this,
 I


read
 this
 book
 pretty
 quickly
 because
 I


was
 like,
 "God,
 what
 if
 this
 wins
 the


book?"
 And
 this
 is
 a
 type
 of
 reading


that
 I
 think
 all
 of
 us
 in
 the
 department


do
 when
 we
 have
 to.
 It's
 like
 eating


without
 chewing.
 You're
 just
 trying
 to


like
 get
 through
 a
 book.
 Almost
 right


away,
 like
 after
 the
 first
 couple


entries,
 I
 slowed
 down
 to
 a
 normal
 pace


because
 I
 was
 like,
 there
 is
 something


going
 on
 with
 the
 language
 here
 that
 is


really
 beautiful.
 There's
 a
 phrase
 from


the
 narrator's
 first
 stint,
 the
 silence


here
 is
 so
 thick
 it
 makes
 me
 feel


wealthy.
 I
 remember
 13
 14
 months
 after


the
 fact.
 Now
 readers,
 I
 am
 sorry
 I


cannot
 give
 you
 more
 of
 my
 favorite
 Bon


Mo
 because
 my
 copy
 with
 all
 my


underlines
 has
 mysteriously
 gone


missing.
 But
 I


>> we're
 not
 going
 to
 call
 out
 who
 at
 the


New
 York
 Times
 has
 stolen
 your
 book.


>> Somebody
 Somebody
 has
 my
 copy
 and
 I
 hope


they
 got
 as
 much
 joy
 out
 of
 it
 as
 I
 did.


Jamanna
 is
 so
 not
 bitter
 about
 it.


>> No,
 [laughter]


I
 definitely
 took
 all
 the
 Christlike


messages
 away
 from
 this
 book.


>> Dave,
 you
 read
 this
 one?


>> I
 did.
 Yeah,
 I
 loved
 the
 sort
 of


fablelike
 structure
 of
 it.
 the
 three


invaders
 and
 the
 three
 things
 that
 that


that
 try
 as
 she
 might.
 She's
 been
 her


whole
 main
 goal
 in
 this
 is
 to
 shut
 out


the
 world
 is
 to
 escape
 from
 society
 and


to
 just
 reflect
 on
 what's
 within.
 And


the
 world
 just
 keeps
 coming
 in
 and
 it


doesn't,
 you
 know,
 let
 up.
 And
 the
 mice


is
 the
 last
 straw,
 right?
 It's
 this
 huge


wave
 of
 climate
 refugees
 essentially.
 I


mean
 there
 is
 that
 sort
 of
 aspect
 of
 it


too.
 But
 it
 starts
 with
 innocuous


things,
 right?
 Just
 the
 bones
 of
 a
 dead


naan.


>> That's
 innocuous.
 [laughter]


>> Innocuous
 in
 that
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 like


chew
 through
 your
 house,
 right?
 Like


[laughter]
 innocuous
 in
 that
 it's
 an


inanimate
 a
 formerly
 animate
 but
 now


inanimate
 object.
 So,
 in
 that
 sense,
 but


they
 start
 to
 to
 unravel
 what
 she
 worked


hard
 to
 to
 preserve,
 which
 is
 this
 sort


of
 inner
 peace
 that
 that
 she's
 so


desperately
 seeking.
 And
 I
 love
 that


structure.
 And
 I
 just
 love
 the
 idea,
 the


basic
 premise
 of
 it.
 But
 the
 execution,


I
 think,
 also
 brought
 it
 over
 the
 top


for
 me.
 Like,
 it
 really
 it's
 great


writing.
 It's
 disciplined
 writing.
 It's


it's
 beautifully
 descriptive
 and


meditative,
 and
 I
 loved
 it.


Earlier
 this
 year,
 I
 read
 a
 memoir,
 a


piece
 of
 non-fiction
 by
 Pico
 Ayer.
 The


title
 of
 that
 was
 A
 Flame
 Learning
 from


Silence,
 and
 I
 interviewed
 him
 on
 this


podcast,
 and
 it
 was
 a
 memoir
 about
 his


visits
 over
 decades
 to
 a
 Benedicting


hermitage
 in
 in
 Big
 Su,
 California.
 He's


been
 going
 for
 more
 than
 30
 years.
 And
 I


think
 I
 read
 this
 and
 Stoneyard


devotional
 at
 around
 the
 same
 time.
 And


everything
 you're
 saying
 about
 the
 book,


Dave
 and
 Jumata,
 is
 correct.
 It's


beautifully
 written.
 The
 main
 character


is
 is
 inviting
 in
 how
 much
 to
 me
 she
 was


inviting
 in
 how
 much
 she
 wanted
 to
 shut


out
 the
 world
 and
 that
 appealed
 to
 me
 in


some
 sick
 way.
 But
 reading
 these
 two


books
 at
 the
 same
 time
 really
 made
 me


want
 to
 go
 on
 a
 silent
 retreat
 and
 I


think
 that
 is
 what
 is
 in
 store
 in
 2026.


Have
 either
 of
 you
 ever
 done
 anything


like
 that?


>> I
 go
 camping
 a
 lot.
 That's
 but
 it's


actually
 no
 it's
 not
 like
 that
 at
 all


because
 I
 have
 [laughter]
 two
 screaming


children
 with
 me


who
 go
 ferals.
 Yeah,
 it's
 not
 quite
 an


escape.
 [laughter]
 But
 yeah,


occasionally
 there
 are
 moments
 where
 you


can
 unplug
 and
 get
 away.
 Your
 your
 phone


goes
 out
 of
 service
 and
 you
 feel


disconnected
 in
 at
 least
 briefly.


>> I
 think
 the
 closest
 I've
 come
 is
 like


long
 airplane
 trips.


>> You
 never
 hit
 the
 Wi-Fi?


>> No.
 That's
 crazy.
 Okay,
 first
 of
 all,


they're
 definitely
 tracking
 everything
 I


do.
 I
 don't
 need
 them
 to
 know
 that.
 But


also,
 I
 like
 the
 feeling
 of
 being


intentionally
 out
 of
 reach
 while
 I'm
 in


transit.


>> There
 was
 a
 time
 when
 I
 was
 going
 to


like
 a
 Buddhist
 center
 pretty
 regularly.


It
 has
 totally
 imploded
 under
 a
 a
 power


scandal,
 but
 yeah,
 it's
 [laughter]
 been


a
 while.
 It's
 totally
 imploded,
 but
 I


think
 the
 tenants
 remain,
 but


>> you
 know
 what?
 We're
 all
 just
 human
 and


flawed.
 Truly,
 I
 mean
 really.
 If
 you


want
 to
 see
 the
 fallibility
 of
 the


human,
 just
 look
 at
 what
 happened
 at


this
 Buddhist
 order.


>> That
 was
 Stoneyard
 Devotional
 by


Charlotte
 Wood.
 Dave,
 I'd
 love
 to
 talk


about
 the
 next
 book
 on
 our
 list,
 which


is
 The
 Director
 by
 Daniel
 Kan.
 This
 is
 a


book
 that
 I've
 recommended
 to
 so
 many


people
 this
 year.
 This
 is
 not
 a
 brag.


I'm
 just
 going
 to
 say
 I
 was
 in
 Tellide


this
 summer
 for
 the
 film
 festival
 and
 I


was
 at
 the
 bookstore
 there
 and
 I
 was


talking
 to
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 and
 they


asked
 me
 what
 book
 I
 should
 recommend


and
 this
 is
 always
 always
 always
 the


first
 book
 that
 I
 have
 since
 I
 read
 it


early
 this
 year
 sort
 of
 uh
 given
 to


people
 and
 one
 of
 the
 ladies
 went
 I


think
 uh
 and
 took
 it
 off
 the
 shelf
 and


bought
 it.
 It's
 so
 wonderful.


>> It's
 very
 gratifying
 when
 that
 happens.


>> I
 know.
 I
 know.
 She
 probably
 went
 back


afterwards
 got
 a
 refund.
 She
 was
 like


I'm
 not
 going to
 listen
 to
 that
 jerk.


Tell
 us
 about
 this
 one.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 such
 a
 great
 book
 to


recommend
 because
 I
 think
 it
 would


please
 so
 many
 different
 types
 of


readers.
 He's
 the
 rare
 writer
 who
 can


deliver
 the
 goods
 for
 a
 popular
 audience


like
 have
 action
 and
 a
 lively
 plot
 and


Nazis
 whom
 everyone
 loves
 to
 read
 about.


But
 there's
 also
 this
 subtlety
 and
 the


stylistic
 range
 and
 the
 bristling


intelligence
 for
 that
 stuckup
 reader


who's
 always
 telling
 you
 that
 he
 never


reads
 contemp
 and
 it's
 always


[clears throat]
 a
 man.
 [laughter]
 Never.


I
 never
 read
 contemporary
 fiction.
 This


sort
 of
 arrogant
 reader
 that
 that
 I
 also


am.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 it
 it
 really
 covers


those
 bases.
 It's
 a
 great
 book
 to


recommend
 to
 anyone.
 The
 book
 is
 about


the
 life
 and
 times
 of
 GW
 Paps
 who
 is
 an


Austrian
 filmmaker
 who
 sees
 success
 in


the
 silent
 era
 with
 films
 like
 Pandora's


box
 which
 was
 a
 very
 popular
 vehicle
 for


the
 actress
 Louise
 Brooks.
 is
 famous
 by


the
 30s
 and
 is
 invited
 to
 Hollywood
 to


come
 and
 make
 movies
 for
 Hollywood
 and


he's
 a
 fish
 out
 of
 water
 there.
 It


doesn't
 really
 work
 out
 for
 him,
 but


he's
 trying
 and
 he
 decides
 to
 go
 back
 to


Europe
 because
 his
 mother
 is
 ailing
 and


he
 wants
 to
 see
 her
 and
 take
 care
 of


her.
 But
 the
 timing
 couldn't
 be
 worse.


Hitler
 has
 come
 to
 power.
 The
 Nazis
 have


taken
 over.
 after
 they've
 invaded
 Poland


and
 end
 of
 quickly
 taking
 over
 Europe


and
 he's
 stuck
 there.
 He
 can't
 leave.


And
 so
 now
 he
 is
 stuck
 in
 what
 is
 now


called
 Ostark
 and
 working
 as
 a
 filmmaker


essentially
 for
 the
 Reich.
 He
 has
 this


harrowing
 meeting
 with
 Joseph
 Gobles
 who


tells
 him
 you
 can
 do
 whatever
 you
 want.


You're
 free
 to
 do
 anything.
 And
 of


course
 that's
 exactly
 the
 opposite
 of


what
 he
 says.
 He's
 not
 forced
 to
 make


propaganda
 per
 se,
 but
 he
 definitely
 is


hampered
 in
 his
 ability
 to
 cover


anything
 political,
 anything
 with
 a


social
 message
 and
 and
 is
 forced
 to


compromise
 artistic
 principles
 at
 every


juncture.
 So,
 this
 is
 a
 sort
 of
 awkward


circumstances
 he
 finds
 himself
 in
 and


the
 book
 goes
 from
 there.
 It's
 a


wonderful
 portrait
 of
 a
 time
 and
 a


place,
 but
 I
 think
 the
 best
 the
 most


interesting
 themes
 are
 around
 this


central
 tension
 between
 your
 artistic


integrity
 and
 your
 life
 staying
 alive.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 your
 family.


>> And
 your
 family.
 Exactly.


>> Yeah.
 Cuz
 he
 has
 a
 young
 son
 and
 a
 wife


and
 they
 go
 back
 and
 the
 wife
 very


wisely
 is
 against
 going
 back
 to
 his


home.
 She
 knew
 what
 was
 up.
 And
 and


there
 are
 scenes
 in
 which
 you
 see
 the


son
 essentially
 being
 co-opted
 by
 the


Hitler
 youth,
 a
 young
 person
 trying
 to


sort
 of
 make
 his
 way
 through
 the
 world.


Then
 it
 feels
 like
 through
 each
 of
 these


characters,
 you
 get
 a
 sense
 of
 the


different
 reactions
 that
 one
 would
 have


to
 uh
 a
 terrible
 situation
 like
 this,
 a


situation
 where
 you
 have
 to
 make


compromises
 with
 a
 fascist
 or


authoritarian
 regime,
 a
 situation
 where


in
 the
 wife's
 case,
 you
 have
 to
 to
 to


try
 to
 go
 along
 to
 get
 along
 with
 other


wives
 and
 other
 people
 who
 are
 part
 of


this
 apparatus.
 And
 in
 the
 young
 son's


case,
 he's
 just
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 who


he
 is
 as
 a
 person,
 let
 alone
 all
 this


other
 stuff
 going
 on.
 I
 thought
 they're


all
 sketched
 out
 incredibly
 well.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I
 think
 the
 staging,
 you
 know,
 your


point
 about
 the
 wife,
 one
 of
 the


standout
 scenes
 in
 my
 mind
 is
 she's
 gone


to
 a
 book
 club
 with
 other
 wives
 of


artists
 who
 are
 in
 similar
 situations.


And
 the
 dialogue
 is
 so
 over
 the
 top,
 and


it's
 comedic.
 The
 humor
 of
 that
 moment


is
 amazing
 to
 perceive.
 I
 think
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 I
 really
 admired
 about


this
 book
 was
 how
 in
 control
 Kelman
 was


to
 the
 point
 that
 there
 are
 moments
 of


absurdity
 and
 humor
 and
 levity.
 I
 mean,


he's
 still
 pulling
 at
 all
 these


different
 modes
 even
 under
 this


overarching
 oppressive


airless
 environment.
 [clears throat]


>> And
 the
 climax
 was,


I
 think,
 so
 unbelievably


well
 done.
 I
 actually
 had
 the
 feeling


when
 I
 was
 reading
 it
 of
 like
 when
 I
 was


a
 kid
 and
 I
 was
 reading
 something
 that
 I


could
 comprehend
 the
 words,
 but
 I
 was


clearly
 not
 ready
 for
 the
 emotional


ramifications.
 You
 know,
 I
 was
 like


reading
 something
 I
 wasn't
 really
 ready


for.
 And
 I
 had
 that
 feeling
 reading


this.
 It
 was
 one
 of
 the
 more
 emotionally


affecting
 novels
 I've
 read
 this
 year.


And
 for
 that,
 I
 really
 also
 credit
 the


translator
 Ross
 Benjamin.
 I've
 said
 this


before
 about
 this
 book,
 but
 when
 we're


talking
 about
 a
 universe
 in
 which
 the


wrong
 gesture
 or
 the
 wrong
 amount
 of
 eye


contact,
 let
 alone
 the
 wrong
 word,
 can


have
 disastrous
 consequences.
 I
 think


being
 able
 to
 bring
 a
 text
 into
 English


with
 all
 those
 nuances
 is
 a
 real
 feat.


>> That
 was
 the
 director
 by
 Daniel
 Kan.
 I


am
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 a
 book
 that
 I


think
 will
 be
 somewhat
 divisive
 but
 but


that
 many
 of
 us
 at
 the
 book
 review
 were


pretty
 passionate
 about.
 It
 is
 a
 book


called
 Angel
 Down
 by
 Daniel
 Krauss.
 This


is
 essentially


historical
 fiction/horror.


The
 basic
 story
 is
 it
 takes
 place
 during


World
 War
 I.
 You
 have
 these
 group
 of


soldiers
 in
 France
 in
 the
 muddy
 bloody


trenches
 and
 at
 some
 point
 early
 on
 in


the
 book
 they
 hear
 a
 screaming
 a
 wailing


somewhere
 off
 in
 the
 distance
 in
 no


man's
 land.
 Obviously
 no
 one
 wants
 to
 go


there
 cuz
 you
 have
 to
 wade
 through


barbed
 wire
 and
 corpses
 and
 the
 German


bullets
 coming
 from
 the
 other
 side.
 But


they
 are
 ordered
 to
 go
 stop
 the


screaming,
 find
 this
 person
 and
 put
 them


out
 of
 their
 misery.
 They
 get
 there
 and


they
 find,
 this
 is
 where
 the
 fantastical


elements
 come
 in,
 that
 it
 is
 a
 an
 angel.


It
 is
 a
 genuine
 fallen
 angel,
 a
 female


angel.
 Do
 angels
 have
 genders?
 I
 don't


know.
 Female
 angel.
 They
 have
 to
 get
 the


angel
 out
 of
 there
 and
 figure
 out
 what


to
 do
 with
 her.
 That's
 the
 basic
 plot.


There
 are
 a
 couple
 of
 other
 things
 to


know
 about
 this
 book,
 which
 is
 that
 the


entire
 book
 is
 essentially
 one
 sentence


long.
 It
 is
 one
 sentence
 over
 almost
 300


pages.
 And
 each
 short
 paragraph,
 as
 as


far
 as
 I
 recall,
 begins
 with
 the
 word


and.
 It's
 just
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 neverending


series
 of
 and
 statements
 over
 and
 over


again,
 all
 stitched
 together
 into
 one


sentence.
 The
 other
 thing
 to
 know
 is


that
 this
 book
 is
 very
 gross.
 And
 if


you've
 read
 Daniel
 Krauss
 before,
 or
 at


least
 if
 you
 read
 his
 last
 book,
 which


was
 called
 Whalefall,
 came
 out
 two
 years


ago.
 We
 put
 on
 the
 cover
 of
 the
 book


review
 the
 summer
 it
 came
 out.
 Then
 you


know
 he
 can
 be
 a
 very
 gross
 writer.
 That


book,
 Whalefall,
 was
 about
 a
 scuba


diver.
 He
 goes
 off
 to
 find
 his
 father's


remains,
 which
 have
 his
 father
 died.
 He


was
 also
 a
 scuba
 diver
 underwater
 off


the
 coast
 of
 California.
 The
 son
 goes
 to


find
 his
 dad's
 remains.
 He
 gets


swallowed
 by
 a
 whale.
 And
 he
 has
 to
 make


his
 way
 out
 of
 the
 whale.
 And
 he
 has
 to


make
 his
 way
 out
 in
 incredibly


visceral
 detail.
 And
 I'm
 using
 visceral


here
 because
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


>> viscera.


>> Viscera.
 These
 are
 very
 gushy
 books.


There's
 a
 lot
 of


>> squaltching,


>> a
 lot
 of
 squelching,
 a
 lot
 of
 blood,
 a


lot
 just
 every
 everything
 you
 can


imagine,
 right?
 The
 whale
 fall.
 It's
 not


like
 Jeppetto
 and
 Pinocchio
 [laughter]


inside
 Monstro,
 a
 giant
 clean
 cathedral


of
 the
 inside
 of
 a
 whale
 with
 the


ribbones
 holding
 up
 the
 ceiling.
 This
 is


some
 nasty
 nasty
 stuff.
 And
 in
 the
 same


way,
 Angel
 Down
 incredibly
 nasty.
 I,
 as


someone
 who
 loves
 horror,
 and
 I,
 as


someone
 who
 can
 appreciate
 historical


fiction,
 was
 surprised
 to
 find
 that
 they


work
 so
 well
 together
 in
 this
 book.
 It's


not
 going
 to
 be
 to
 everyone's
 taste,
 but


I
 actually
 think
 it's
 part
 of
 the
 fun,


and
 it's
 kind
 of
 part
 of
 our


responsibility
 at
 the
 book
 review
 to


find
 books
 sometimes
 that
 people
 have


not
 heard
 of
 that
 may
 be
 not
 to


everyone's
 liking
 and
 elevate
 them.
 And


I
 think
 and
 I'm
 hoping
 that's
 what
 we're


doing
 here
 with
 Angel
 Down.


>> At
 what
 paragraph
 starting
 with
 and
 or


did
 you
 think,
 oh,
 we're
 in
 for
 a
 treat?


Did
 you
 know
 like
 from
 the
 first
 page?


Sometimes
 I
 have
 that
 with
 books
 that


end
 up
 on
 this
 list.


>> It's
 hard
 to
 remember
 exactly
 because
 it


it
 is
 possible
 that
 every
 single
 body


part
 that
 a
 person
 have
 is
 described
 in


some
 way
 detached
 from
 the
 human
 body
 in


this
 book.
 So,
 it
 may
 it
 wasn't
 when
 the


main
 character
 has
 the
 ear
 plastered
 to


his
 face
 cuz
 I
 think
 that's
 in
 the
 first


few
 pages,
 but
 it
 might
 be.
 There
 might


have
 been
 teeth
 involved.
 Again,
 if
 you


think
 this
 is
 not
 for
 you,


>> not
 for
 everyone,
 [laughter]


>> that's
 fine.
 But
 I
 say
 give
 it
 a
 chance.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> It's
 remarkable
 at
 how
 and
 this
 word
 is


intentional.
 Beautiful
 some
 of
 these


descriptions


>> can
 actually
 be.
 It's
 bizarre.
 like
 how


you
 can
 read
 something
 about


decapitation,
 a
 description
 of
 something


harrowing
 and
 and
 be
 like,
 "Wow,
 this


can
 be
 made
 into
 a
 beautiful
 sentence
 or


part
 of
 a
 sentence,
 I
 should
 say."


>> Yeah.
 There's
 a
 moment
 where
 he's


holding
 somebody
 under
 the
 arms
 like
 a


breach
 baby
 or
 something
 and
 it's
 like,


"Okay."
 Wow.
 All
 right.
 All right.
 For


my
 obstatrician
 friends
 out
 there,


>> it
 is
 quite
 a
 performance.
 There
 are,
 as


you
 say,
 descriptions
 and
 metaphors
 that


I
 don't
 think
 I'd
 ever
 heard
 before.
 or


of
 course
 they're
 attached
 to
 a
 war


story
 which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most


stereotypical
 pieces
 of
 historical


fiction
 that
 one
 can
 produce.
 But
 I


think
 the
 way
 in
 which
 he
 takes
 the


World
 War
 I
 story,
 the
 war
 story,
 the


story
 about
 men
 dealing
 with
 their
 own


mortality
 and
 the
 emptiness
 of
 the
 world


and
 turns
 it
 into
 something
 unexpected


was
 surprising
 in
 a
 good
 way.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 thought
 he
 really
 did
 make


that
 very
 tired
 trope
 very
 interesting.


So
 that
 is
 Angel
 Down
 by
 Daniel
 Krauss.


I
 am
 going
 to
 turn
 to
 Jumanna
 to
 talk


about
 I
 don't
 know if
 it's
 the
 direct


opposite
 of
 Angel
 Down
 cuz
 it's
 hard
 to


describe
 Angel
 Down,
 hard
 to
 describe


what
 the
 opposite
 would
 be,
 but
 it's


something
 that
 is
 very
 different.
 And


again,
 Jumanna,
 few
 people
 on
 the
 desk


are
 as
 passionate
 about
 a
 book
 as
 you


can
 be
 when
 you
 really
 get
 behind


something.
 And
 the
 Sisters
 is
 a
 book


that
 you've
 been
 talking
 about
 for


months
 and
 months.
 Everybody's
 ready
 for


this
 year
 to
 be
 over.
 All
 my
 colleagues


are
 ready
 for
 [laughter]
 this
 year
 to
 be


over.
 I
 can
 tell.


>> Well,
 we've
 all
 heard
 about
 the
 sisters


a
 lot.
 So,
 please
 tell
 our
 listeners


about
 it.


>> I
 heard
 you
 like
 this
 book,
 Jan.


>> Yeah,
 I
 have
 I
 I'm
 working
 out
 my


feelings
 about
 this
 book.
 So,
 just
 when


I
 thought
 that
 I
 had
 really
 sworn
 off


autofiction,
 there
 comes
 [laughter]
 an


autofictional
 novel
 that
 has
 totally


knocked
 me
 sideways
 and
 I've
 stayed


there
 for
 the
 last
 six
 months.
 So,
 This


is
 the
 story
 of
 the
 Mika
 sisters,
 Ena,


Evelyn,
 and
 Anastasia.
 They
 are
 Swedish


Tunisian,
 which
 sort
 of
 sets
 them
 apart


in
 the
 parts
 of
 Stockholm
 where
 they're


growing
 up,
 but
 they
 are
 fiercely
 bonded


and
 they
 are
 also
 the
 object
 of


fascination
 for
 our
 narrator
 who
 is
 also


named
 Yonas,
 who
 is
 also
 Swedish


Tunisian
 and
 is
 a
 sort
 of
 goofy,


neurotic,
 exuberant,
 depressive


standin
 for
 the
 author
 himself.


So
 this
 book
 is
 one
 of
 the
 first
 things


you'll
 see
 if
 you
 look
 at
 it
 if
 you
 look


at
 a
 physical
 copy
 is
 that
 it
 is
 quite


long
 and
 even


>> that's
 not
 a
 bad
 thing.


>> No,
 no,
 [laughter]
 no.
 I'm
 agreeing
 with


you.
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 the
 next
 book


we're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 is
 also
 long


and
 we
 think
 that
 that's
 a
 good
 thing.


And
 the
 length
 is
 intentional
 and
 it


flies
 because
 I
 remember
 reading
 a


little
 about
 this
 book
 and
 it
 has
 a
 very


strict
 structure
 which
 is
 the
 first


section
 covers
 one
 year
 then
 the
 next


six
 months
 and
 then
 you
 know
 in


decreasing
 amounts
 of
 time
 and
 I
 know
 I


profiled
 the
 author
 so
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 or
 I


know
 more
 about
 the
 sort
 of
 interior


machinations
 he
 had
 when
 he
 was
 working


on
 this
 and
 I
 do
 have
 to
 appreciate
 when


you
 ask
 an
 author
 and
 you're
 like
 yeah


what
 did
 you
 have
 in
 mind
 when
 you
 were


working
 on
 this
 and
 he's
 like,
 "Oh,
 war


in
 peace
 [laughter]


>> naturally,


>> but
 it's
 actually
 apt
 in
 the
 sense
 that


he's
 working
 on
 a
 huge
 canvas
 because


this
 is
 a
 book
 that
 goes
 from
 Stockholm


to
 Tunis
 to
 Germany
 to
 like
 Newalts
 or


Kingston,
 New
 York.
 There
 is
 a
 bit
 of


family
 lore
 about
 the
 Empire
 State


Building.
 It
 just
 manages
 to
 contain
 so


much
 life,
 including
 life's
 really
 low


moments.
 I
 think
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 most


moving
 descriptions
 of
 being
 depressed


or
 grief
 that
 you
 can
 feel.
 And
 I
 was


very
 excited
 by
 the
 central
 conceit
 of


this
 book,
 which
 is
 that
 the
 Mika


sisters,
 they
 have
 a
 very
 eccentric
 mom


who
 is
 a
 Tunisian
 carpet
 seller,
 and
 she


makes
 a
 point
 of
 uprooting
 the
 girls


almost
 like
 every
 six
 months.
 Basically,


when
 I
 think
 she
 sold
 every
 carpet
 she


can
 in
 a
 various
 neighborhood,
 they


change
 neighborhoods.
 So


>> she
 has
 raised
 her
 girls
 by
 saying,


"Somebody's
 put
 a
 curse
 on
 us.


Somebody's
 put
 the
 evil
 eye
 on
 us."
 And


so
 the
 girls
 are
 trying
 to
 outrun
 this.


And
 Chamir
 himself
 when
 we
 talked
 said,


"I
 actually
 have
 been
 living,
 he's
 in


his
 40s.
 I
 have
 been
 living
 for
 decades


with
 the
 feeling
 that
 I
 was
 cursed
 by
 my


own
 father.
 And
 this
 book
 is
 the
 way


that
 I
 wrote
 myself
 out
 of
 it.
 I'm
 very


primed."
 Okay,
 I
 will
 say
 somebody
 who


has
 witchy


witchy
 Middle
 Eastern
 family,
 I'm
 sort


of
 like,
 yeah,
 I
 like
 I
 if
 that's
 all
 I


had
 to
 do
 was
 write
 a
 book
 like
 yeah,


maybe
 I
 should
 do
 that
 and
 get
 out
 from


whatever
 evil
 eye
 I've
 got
 on
 me.


>> Are
 you
 Are
 you
 a
 witch?


>> Yeah.


>> No,
 I'm
 not
 a
 w
 I'm
 a
 Buddhist.




[laughter]
>> You
 know,
 you
 know
 curses
 don't
 exist,


right?


>> That's
 not
 true.


>> That's
 not
 true.
 Let
 me
 tell
 you
 as
 as


our
 sort
 of
 fertile
 crescent
 middle
 east


correspondent,
 curses
 are
 very
 real,


right?
 Like
 you
 just
 walk
 down
 Hamro


Street.
 It's
 just
 they're
 real.
 You


we'll
 just
 have
 to
 agree
 to
 disagree
 on


that.


>> I
 think
 we
 need
 a
 disclaimer
 for
 this


episode.


>> Yeah.
 [laughter]


>> I
 think
 everything
 I've
 said
 is
 factual


and
 based
 in
 reality.


>> So,
 actually,
 that's
 a
 good
 point,


though,
 because
 So,
 it's
 clear
 that
 I


had
 a
 very
 visceral
 and
 personal


reaction
 to
 this
 book.
 I
 would
 love
 to


hear
 what
 somebody
 else
 thought
 about


this
 book
 who
 did
 not
 necessarily


recognize


members
 of
 their
 extended
 family
 and
 the


characters.


>> Okay.
 Yeah.
 I
 just
 love
 the
 portrayal
 of


the
 sisters.
 They're
 so
 independently


realized.
 They're
 really
 fully
 realized.


They're
 just
 great.
 They're
 they
 work
 as


characters
 in
 tandem
 but
 also
 in


opposition.
 And
 he
 just
 did
 a
 really


good
 job
 fleshing
 out
 their
 various


idiosyncrasies
 and
 desires
 and
 wants.
 I


I
 thought
 that
 was
 very
 impressive.


We're
 only
 talking
 about
 three
 sisters


here,
 but
 even
 with
 that,
 you
 could
 see


yourself
 in
 a
 different
 books,
 seeing


them
 blend
 into
 each
 other
 and
 losing


track
 of
 like,
 okay,
 who,
 you
 know,


this,
 this,
 and
 what
 did
 this
 person
 do?


And
 but
 they
 feel
 so
 distinct,
 each
 of


them,
 and
 and
 I
 never
 got
 lost.
 The
 book


has
 such
 an
 energy,
 particularly
 at
 the


beginning.
 It
 shoots
 you
 into
 their


lives
 and
 over
 the
 length
 of
 this
 book,


which
 is
 not
 insignificant.
 I
 feel
 like


you
 you
 stick
 with
 them
 the
 whole
 time.


It's
 it's
 we
 like
 to
 make
 fun
 of
 long


books
 partially
 because
 of
 the
 book


review.
 We
 have
 to
 read
 a
 lot
 of
 books.


So
 when
 we
 find
 a
 long
 book,
 it's
 like,


"Oh
 no,
 I
 could
 be
 reading
 three
 books


while
 I'm
 reading
 this
 one."
 But
 this


one
 justifies
 the
 length.
 It
 really


does.


>> There's
 so
 much
 life
 in
 this
 book.
 There


really
 is.
 And
 there's
 a
 just
 energy
 and


movement
 to
 it.


>> So
 that
 was
 The
 Sisters
 by
 Yonas
 Hassan


Kamiri.
 We're
 gonna
 transition
 to
 the


fifth
 book
 on
 our
 fiction
 list,
 The


Loneliness
 of
 Sonia
 and
 Sunny
 by
 Kieran


Desai.


>> It's
 a
 great
 old-fashioned
 novel
 and


old-fashioned
 in
 the
 best
 way.
 It
 is
 a


story
 of
 it's
 a
 romance.
 It's
 set
 in
 the


late
 90s,
 early
 2000s
 between
 two


Indian-American
 people
 named
 Sonia
 and


Sunny.
 Sonia
 is
 a
 college
 student.
 When


we
 first
 meet
 her,
 she
 meets
 an
 older


artist
 named
 Elon,
 who
 is
 this
 sort
 of


manic,
 arrogant
 artist
 who
 acts
 as
 a


real
 pygmian
 figure
 and
 is
 somewhat


abusive,
 but
 also
 very
 much
 very


important
 to
 her
 sort
 of
 awakening
 as
 an


artist.
 He
 moves
 her
 to
 New
 York.
 She


wants
 to
 be
 a
 writer,
 by
 the
 way.
 He


moves
 her
 to
 New
 York
 and
 then
 promptly


breaks
 her
 heart
 and
 we
 go
 from
 there.


And
 Sunny
 is
 a
 burgeoning
 journalist


from
 India.
 He
 lives
 in
 Brooklyn
 with


Oola
 who
 is
 a
 white
 woman
 from
 Kansas.


And
 things
 don't
 quite
 work
 out
 between


them.
 And
 so
 Sonia
 and
 Sunny
 meet
 on
 a


train
 while
 visiting
 India
 and
 begin


their
 romance.
 They
 knew
 each
 other
 from


before
 because
 their
 parents
 had
 tried


to
 arrange
 a
 marriage
 that
 neither
 of


them
 at
 the
 time
 was
 particularly


interested
 in
 pursuing.
 But
 the
 second


time
 around
 when
 they
 meet


independently,
 the
 sparks
 fly.
 But
 of


course,
 complications
 remain.
 I
 love


this
 book
 because
 you
 could
 just
 really


sink
 into
 it.
 It's
 long
 and
 so
 many


people
 are
 going
 to
 complain
 that
 it


could
 have
 been
 shorter,
 which
 is
 the


perennial
 complaint
 about
 long
 books.


obviously,
 but
 I
 really
 felt
 there
 was


just
 a
 an
 energy
 to
 this
 book.
 It
 was


one
 of
 those
 books
 that
 I
 found
 it
 very


difficult
 to
 put
 down.


>> A
 friend
 of
 mine,
 while
 they
 were


reading
 this
 book,
 said
 something
 to
 the


effect
 of,
 "Every
 time
 I
 wasn't
 reading


this
 book,
 I
 wanted
 to
 be
 reading
 this


book."
 And
 our
 critic
 Alexander
 Jacobs,


I
 just
 want
 to
 quickly
 read
 the
 first


paragraph
 in
 her
 review,
 which
 was
 a


rave.
 She
 wrote
 quote
 almost
 20
 years
 in


the
 making.
 The
 loneliness
 of
 Sonia
 and


Sunny
 by
 Kieran
 Desai
 is
 not
 so
 much
 a


novel
 as
 a
 marvel.
 In
 an
 era
 of
 hot


takes
 and
 chile
 optimized
 productivity,


here
 is
 sweet
 validation
 of
 the
 idea


that
 to
 create
 something
 truly


transcendent,
 a
 work
 of
 art
 depicting


love,
 family,
 nature,
 and
 culture
 and


all
 their
 fullness
 might
 take
 time.


>> There's
 so
 much
 life
 in
 this
 book.
 And


the
 backstory
 of
 this
 novel
 is
 that
 it's


been
 about
 20
 years
 since
 Kieran
 Desai


published
 a
 novel.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 it's


safe
 to
 say
 that
 Sonia
 and
 Sunny
 totally


took
 over
 her
 life
 in
 the
 intervening


time.
 At
 one
 point,
 the
 manuscript
 was


over
 5,000
 pages,
 which
 she
 didn't


realize
 until
 she
 started
 printing
 it


out.
 So,
 we
 should
 probably
 donate
 to


whatever
 writing
 center
 or
 fellowship


she
 was
 at
 at
 the
 time.
 And
 I
 think
 that


accounts
 for
 how
 much
 sort
 of
 wisdom
 and


heartbreak
 and
 perspective
 there
 is.
 And


I
 think
 another
 thing
 to
 mention
 is


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 sensuality
 and
 tactile


feeling
 in
 this
 book
 that's
 so


important.
 And
 she's
 drawing
 from
 a
 lot


of
 literary
 traditions.
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


us
 have
 compared
 it
 to
 a
 great
 sweeping


old-fashioned
 novel,
 but
 there's


elements
 of
 surrealism.
 There's
 maybe


some
 folklore.
 There's
 a
 there's
 a
 a
 dog


that
 literally
 dogs
 Sonia
 that's
 a


little
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 say
 magical


realism.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 say
 magical


realism.
 And
 it's
 just
 it's
 really
 just


wonderful
 to
 watch
 her
 pull
 this


together
 like
 on
 this
 huge
 loom.
 And


actually
 this
 was
 a
 book
 that
 I
 was


reading
 on
 vacation.
 did
 not
 realize
 I


was
 so
 absorbed
 in
 it
 that
 I
 did
 not


realize
 that
 the
 neighbors
 orchard
 was


on
 fire.
 The
 other
 thing
 that
 I
 should


mention
 is
 that
 the
 audio
 book
 is


wonderful.
 The
 narrator,
 it
 just
 gives


like
 a
 real
 braver
 performance.


Everybody
 has
 these
 unbelievable
 voices


and
 it
 really
 rounds
 it
 out.
 It's


already
 such
 a
 richly
 textured
 book
 and


then
 to
 hear
 it
 in
 audio
 sends
 it
 over


the
 top.
 I
 would
 say


>> one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 really
 loved


about
 this
 book
 was
 the
 essential
 theme


of
 the
 challenge,
 the
 pressure
 of
 an


artist
 to


to
 fall
 into
 racial
 tropes
 and
 questions


of
 identity
 and
 the
 ex
 those
 sort
 of


western
 expectations
 for
 eastern
 and


orientalist
 art
 and
 her
 dealing
 with


that
 is
 so
 complex
 and
 interesting.
 One


of
 the
 things
 that
 Elon
 emphasizes
 to


Sonia
 is
 to
 not
 do
 that
 is
 to
 to
 to


resist
 stay
 away
 from
 narratives
 that


you
 know
 that
 that
 white
 readers
 want
 of


Asian
 writers
 of
 South
 Asian
 writers
 and


and
 she
 both
 Kieran
 des
 the
 author
 both


resists
 and
 reinvents
 that
 she
 doesn't


necessarily
 shy
 away
 from
 those
 themes


but
 she
 really
 makes
 them
 uniquely
 hers.


I
 think
 the
 biggest
 danger
 of
 course
 is


and
 what
 Elon
 was
 chiding
 her
 against


was
 to
 avoid
 cliches
 and
 to
 avoid


writing
 things
 that
 had
 already
 been


done
 and
 formulaic
 stuff
 but
 but
 this
 is


this
 couldn't
 be
 further
 from
 what


Kieran
 Desai
 is
 doing.
 I
 mean
 it
 really


just
 like
 I
 said
 just
 making
 it
 hers.


>> That
 was
 the
 loneliness
 of
 Sonia
 and


Sunny
 by
 Kieran
 Desai.
 Jima
 and
 Dave


before
 we
 end
 this
 segment
 of
 our
 best


books
 of
 2025
 episode.
 I'd
 love
 to
 hear


from
 each
 of
 you
 about
 a
 book
 or
 two


that
 you
 wish
 had
 been
 one
 of
 our
 top
 10


books
 of
 the
 year.


>> Yeah,
 I
 have
 two
 at
 the
 ready.
 One
 is


Audition
 by
 Katie
 Kamura.
 I'm
 always


interested
 in
 what
 she
 publishes.
 Every


single
 novel
 she's
 changing
 her


perspective
 and
 what
 she's
 up
 to
 and


that
 just
 makes
 her
 very
 exciting
 to


follow.
 And
 so
 this
 novel
 I
 describe
 it


as
 like
 Mhalland
 Drive
 in
 novel
 form.


It's
 a
 psychological
 thriller.
 Yeah,


that's
 a
 movie.


>> Yeah,
 [laughter]


>> that
 is
 a
 movie
 I
 have
 seen.


>> Okay.


>> And
 the
 whole
 gambit
 of
 the
 book
 is
 we


meet
 this
 woman.
 She
 has
 a
 young
 man
 on


her
 trail.
 He
 thinks
 she's
 his
 mother


and
 she's
 like,
 "That's
 impossible.


That's
 biologically
 impossible."
 And


then
 it
 just
 gets
 a
 little
 weirder.
 And


then
 midway
 through
 the
 book,
 the
 entire


circumstances
 change.
 And
 you're
 really


left
 wondering,
 how
 do
 I
 reconcile
 these


two
 halves?
 And
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 to
 be


in
 a
 family?
 Or
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 to
 be


an
 artist?
 This
 woman
 is
 a
 pretty


renowned
 stage
 actress.
 I
 I
 thought
 it


was
 elegant,
 understated.


I
 really
 really
 liked
 this
 book
 and
 I


was
 glad
 to
 see
 it
 recognized
 for
 some


prizes.
 You
 know,
 it
 was
 shortlisted
 for


the
 Booker
 and
 that's
 a
 book
 that


deserves
 attention
 for
 sure.
 The
 other


one
 that
 I
 love
 and
 my
 colleagues
 know
 I


love
 this
 book,
 but
 now
 listeners
 get
 to


know
 it's
 called
 Trip
 by
 Amy
 Baradel.


>> I've
 I've
 never
 heard
 you
 talk
 about


this
 book.


>> I
 really
 really
 really
 fought
 for
 this


book.
 So
 this
 is
 the
 story
 of
 a
 woman


who
 is
 a
 documentarian.


She
 is
 raising
 a
 son
 with
 her
 ex
 who
 is


neurode
 divergent.
 I
 think
 is
 on
 the


autism
 spectrum.
 She's
 sent
 to
 Nepal
 to


cover
 this
 Buddhism
 conference.
 And
 now


listeners,
 you
 know
 why
 I'm
 primed
 to


like
 this
 book.
 The
 Buddhist
 stuff
 is


hysterical.
 She
 dies
 and
 she's
 sent
 to


the
 Bardau,
 which
 is
 the
 Buddhist
 like


limbo.
 That's
 not
 a
 spoiler,
 just
 to
 be


clear.
 And
 what
 unfolds
 is
 this
 sort
 of


interdimensional


romp
 that's
 really
 powered
 by
 a
 mother's


love
 for
 her
 son
 and
 and
 concern
 for
 him


that
 traverses
 time
 and
 space.
 And
 I'm


very
 moved
 by
 it.
 And
 frankly,
 it's


weird
 and
 daring.
 I've
 never
 read


anything
 like
 it.
 I
 think
 it
 is
 such
 an


accomplishment.


>> Dave,
 what
 about
 you?


>> I
 really
 liked
 the
 book
 called
 The
 Tokyo


Suite
 by
 the
 Brazilian
 writer
 Giovana


Madalloso.
 This
 is
 a
 novel
 about
 two


women.
 The
 first
 is
 a
 maid.
 Her
 name
 is


Maju.
 And
 the
 second
 is
 her
 boss,


Fernanda,
 who
 is
 a
 hot
 shot
 TV
 producer.


And
 Maju,
 the
 maid,
 has
 kidnapped


Fernand's
 daughter.
 And
 then
 the
 novel


begins
 and
 we
 don't
 know
 why
 she's


kidnapping
 her,
 but
 they're
 on
 the
 run.


And
 we
 get
 both
 of
 their
 perspectives.


We
 get
 their
 internal
 lives,
 their


histories,
 their
 motivations,
 and
 it's


just
 a
 fascinating
 look
 at
 so
 many


themes,
 motherhood,
 class,
 just
 a
 great


sensitive
 portrait,
 but
 also
 very,
 very


funny
 and
 and
 it
 moves.
 It
 moves
 very


quickly.
 I
 really
 love
 that
 book.
 So


again,
 the
 five
 fiction
 books
 on
 our
 top


10
 books
 of
 2025
 list
 are
 The
 Loneliness


of
 Sonia
 and
 Sunny,
 The
 Sisters,
 Angel


Down,
 The
 Director,
 and
 Stoneard


Devotional.
 We
 are
 going
 to
 take
 a
 break


and
 when
 we
 come
 back
 we
 are
 going
 to


hear
 from
 several
 other
 editors
 from
 the


book
 review
 who
 will
 talk
 about
 the
 five


non-fiction
 books
 that
 are
 on
 this


year's
 list.
 Before
 we
 take
 a
 break


though,
 Jumanna,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


being
 on
 once
 again.


>> Thank
 you


>> Dave.
 Thank
 you.
 It
 was
 my
 pleasure.


Welcome
 back.
 This
 is
 the
 book
 review


podcast
 and
 I'm
 Gilbert
 Cruz.
 I'm
 now


joined
 by
 Nema
 Jeromi,
 Greg
 Kohl's,
 and


Emily
 Aken
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 non-fiction


books
 on
 this
 year's
 top
 10
 list.
 Nema,


welcome.


>> Hi,
 Gilbert.


>> Greg,
 hello.


>> Hi,
 Gilbert.


>> Emily,
 thanks
 for
 being
 here.


>> Hi,
 Gilbert.


>> I
 am
 going
 to
 quickly
 start
 by
 listing


all
 five
 of
 these
 books.
 And
 because


they're
 non-fiction,
 they
 all
 have


incredibly
 long
 subtitles.
 And
 then


we're
 going
 to
 jump
 right
 into
 it.
 And


then
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 conversation,


we're
 all
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 some
 other


books
 that
 we
 loved
 from
 2025.
 So,
 our


five
 best
 non-fiction
 books
 of
 the
 year


are
 A
 Marriage
 at
 Sea:
 A
 True
 Story
 of


Love,
 Obsession,
 and
 Shipwreck
 by
 Sophie


Elmhurst,
 Mother
 Emmanuel,
 Two
 Centuries


of
 Race,
 Resistance,
 and
 Forgiveness,


and
 One
 Charleston
 Church
 by
 Kevin
 Sack.


There
 is
 no
 place
 for
 us.
 Working
 and


homeless
 in
 America
 by
 Brian
 Goldstone.


Wild
 Thing,
 a
 life
 of
 Paul
 Goette
 by
 Sue


Predo.
 And
 Mother
 Mary
 comes
 to
 me
 by


Arendi
 Roy.
 No
 subtitle
 there.
 Thank


you,
 Aron
 Daddy
 Roy.
 Let's
 start
 with
 a


marriage
 at
 Sea.
 This
 is
 a
 book
 that
 so


many
 of
 us
 loved
 at
 the
 book
 review.
 I


was
 able
 to
 interview
 the
 author
 Sophie


Elmhurst
 on
 this
 podcast
 earlier
 this


year.
 Greg,
 I'm
 going
 to
 give
 this
 one


to
 you.
 Tell
 us
 about
 the
 book.


>> Sure.
 Well,
 A
 Marriage
 at
 Sea
 is
 the


story
 of
 a
 couple,
 Morris
 and
 Marilyn


Bailey,
 who
 were
 restless
 adventurers
 by


nature
 and
 lived
 out
 of
 touch
 with
 the


domestic
 ideals
 of
 England
 in
 the
 early


1960s
 when
 they
 got
 married.
 So
 in
 June


1972,
 after
 almost
 10
 years
 gamely
 going


through
 the
 motions
 in
 suburbia,
 they


decided
 to
 sell
 their
 bungalow,
 build
 a


boat,
 and
 sail
 to
 New
 Zealand
 to
 start


again.
 It
 would
 be
 a
 challenge
 and
 a


great
 adventure.
 And
 in
 some
 ways,
 they


were
 catastrophically
 unprepared.
 They


had
 no
 radio
 transmitter
 with
 them.


>> It's
 so
 crazy
 that
 they
 had
 [laughter]


no
 no
 radio.


>> Maryland
 didn't
 even
 know
 how
 to
 swim.


>> Uhhuh.


>> Um
 but
 it
 all
 went
 well
 until
 one
 day


they
 had
 reached
 the
 Pacific
 already.


They're
 about
 300
 miles
 away
 from
 the


Galapagus
 Islands.
 A
 sperm
 whale


surfaced
 right
 under
 their
 boat,
 tearing


a
 hole
 through
 it
 and
 capsizing
 them.
 So


Morris
 and
 Marilyn
 grabbed
 the
 life
 raft


and
 whatever
 supplies
 they
 were
 able
 to


gather,
 some
 tins
 of
 food
 and
 water,


some
 tools.
 Interestingly,
 some
 books


and
 notebooks,
 and
 for
 the
 next
 four


months,
 they
 had
 to
 fend
 for
 themselves


in
 this
 little
 dinghy
 on
 the
 open
 ocean,


hoping
 for
 rescue
 as
 ship
 after
 ship


passed
 by
 without
 spotting
 them.
 A
 very


elegant
 summary
 of
 a
 a
 gripping
 story.


I'm
 someone
 who
 loves
 a
 tale
 on
 the
 high


seas.
 I
 love
 a
 shipwreck.
 I
 love
 the


idea
 of
 figuring
 out
 how
 to
 survive
 out


there
 in
 the
 wild.
 This
 is
 a
 story
 that


I'd
 never
 heard
 of
 before,
 even
 though


the
 couple
 themselves
 had
 written
 an


account
 of
 it
 in
 the
 ' 70s,
 but
 the


author,
 Sophie
 Elmhurst,
 she
 takes
 that


account,
 she
 takes
 all
 the


contemporaneous
 news
 stories
 of
 the
 time


and
 really
 weaves
 together
 not
 only
 an


amazing
 retelling
 of
 their
 118
 days
 on


the
 high
 seas,
 but
 also,
 as
 the
 subtitle


indicates,
 it
 is
 really
 this
 story
 about


their
 marriage.
 this
 this
 couple's
 this


odd
 couple's
 odd
 and
 wonderful
 and


unique
 marriage.


>> I
 love
 a
 good
 seaf
 fairing
 tale
 as
 much


as
 you
 do.
 You
 may
 remember
 from
 our


discussion
 last
 year
 of
 Hampton
 Sides's


wide
 wide
 sea.


>> What
 a
 book.


>> Love
 that
 book.


>> I
 read
 The
 Perfect
 Storm.
 I
 read


Nathaniel
 Filick's
 story
 of
 the


whaleship
 Essex
 disaster.
 Mhm.
 And
 I


thought
 as
 I
 was
 reading
 this
 book
 that


I
 had
 maybe
 read
 the
 Bailey's
 memoir


because
 when
 I
 was
 growing
 up,
 I
 read
 a


memoir
 from
 the
 1970s
 of
 a
 disaster
 very


similar
 to
 the
 Bailey's
 thing.
 It
 was
 by


a
 guy,
 Turns
 out
 it
 was
 not
 the
 Bailey's


book.
 It
 was
 a
 book
 called
 Survival
 on


the
 Savage
 Sea
 by
 a
 guy
 named
 Duel


Robertson,
 a
 Scotsman
 who
 with
 his


family
 was
 a
 couple
 of
 hundred
 miles
 off


of
 the
 Galapagus,
 capsized
 by
 in in
 his


case
 it
 was
 a
 pod
 of
 killer
 whales.
 And


they
 survived
 for
 more
 than
 a
 month
 at


sea
 before
 they
 were
 rescued
 by
 a


Japanese
 twler.


>> A
 lot
 of
 similarities
 there,
 catching


turtles.


>> Not
 just
 catching
 turtles,
 but
 with


paper
 clips.
 Safety


>> pins.
 Safety
 pins.
 As
 Gilbert
 said,
 what


makes
 this
 book
 different
 is
 that
 it


really
 is
 a
 portrait
 of
 a
 marriage
 and
 a


marriage
 under
 the
 most
 extreme
 duress


and
 it
 could
 have
 torn
 them
 apart
 or


brought
 them
 closer
 together
 and
 in


their
 case
 it
 bonded
 them
 for
 the
 rest


of
 their
 lives
 having
 gone
 through
 this


experience
 together.


>> Absolutely.
 I
 loved
 this
 book.
 The


writing
 is
 extraordinary.
 It's
 so


vividly
 imagined
 and
 I
 felt
 reading
 it


that
 it
 the
 feat
 of
 imagination
 that


Elmherst
 brings
 to
 this
 story
 was


equivalent
 to
 the
 feat
 of
 imagination


that
 it
 took
 for
 this
 couple
 to


persevere
 mainly
 thanks
 to
 Marilyn.
 And


that's
 what's
 really
 interesting
 is
 that


she
 did
 all
 kinds
 of
 things
 that
 Morris


thought
 was
 completely
 irrational.
 She


sat
 there
 planning
 dinner
 parties
 on


this
 boat.
 She
 planned
 their
 next
 home.


She
 drew
 playing
 cards
 on
 pieces
 of


paper
 that
 would
 get
 totally
 soggy,
 but


she
 kept
 them
 alive
 by
 imagining
 that


they
 were
 alive.


>> For
 me,
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 most


remarkable
 aspects
 of
 this
 book
 also
 is


the
 way
 that
 it
 shifts
 perspective.
 You


are
 so
 on
 the
 boat
 with
 them,
 feeling
 so


tense,
 kind
 of
 mad
 at
 them
 at
 times,
 but


also
 impressed.
 And
 Elmharst
 is
 relaying


throughout
 how
 they're
 decaying
 and


falling
 apart
 and
 gaining
 all
 these


wounds.
 It
 gets
 pretty
 disgusting,
 but


you
 don't
 really
 realize
 how
 bad
 it's


gotten
 until
 they
 are
 Is
 it
 safe
 to
 say,


it's
 not
 a
 spoiler
 to
 say
 they
 are


rescued?


>> I
 don't
 think
 it
 is.
 I
 don't
 think


[laughter]
 it
 is.


>> By
 a
 South
 Korean
 fishing
 vessel
 and


then
 you
 really
 find
 out
 what
 they've


come
 to
 look
 like
 after
 all
 these
 months


at
 sea.
 That's
 what
 I
 think
 helps


elevate
 this
 book
 beyond
 just
 a


retelling
 of
 what
 was
 when
 it
 was


published
 a
 a
 best-selling
 memoir
 is
 the


way
 that
 she
 doesn't
 let
 off
 the
 let
 up


the
 detail
 after
 they
 get
 off
 the
 raft


and
 onto
 the
 fishing
 vessel.
 And
 that


kind
 of
 adds
 vividness
 to
 the
 whole


ordeal.
 when
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 this


book
 in
 our
 meetings
 and
 listeners,
 you


know,
 we
 at
 a
 certain
 point
 we'd
 meet


every
 week
 in
 the
 fall
 to
 to
 discuss
 and


debate
 books
 that
 we're
 considering
 for


this
 top
 10
 list.
 And
 this
 came
 up,
 the


fact
 that
 this
 tale
 had
 been
 told
 before


in
 their
 own
 bestselling
 memoir,
 as
 you


say,
 and


that
 was
 50
 years
 ago.
 I
 don't
 know
 if


anyone
 remembers
 that
 the
 way
 that


Elmharst
 here
 without
 putting
 too
 much


mustard
 on
 it,
 without
 underlining
 it


too
 much,
 without
 [snorts]
 giving
 you


any
 more
 than
 you
 need,
 just
 elegantly


tells
 this
 tale.
 She
 knows
 that
 the


story
 is
 dramatic
 enough
 on
 its
 own
 that


she
 doesn't
 need
 to
 amp
 it
 up.
 I've


recommended
 this
 book
 also
 because
 of


its
 relatively
 short
 length
 compared
 to


some
 of
 the
 other
 books
 in
 our
 list.


I've
 recommended
 it
 to
 so
 many
 people


this
 year
 and
 I
 predict
 that
 this
 is
 one


that
 a
 lot
 of
 readers
 are
 going
 to
 share


with
 others.


>> One
 interesting
 footnote
 I
 read
 that
 she


started
 writing
 the
 book
 during
 the


pandemic
 when
 she
 was
 essentially
 a


drift
 on
 a
 dinghy
 which
 was
 her
 home.


She
 was
 stuck
 on
 it
 for
 the
 duration
 of


the
 lockdown
 in
 England.
 And
 and
 I
 think


you
 you
 really
 feel
 the
 passion
 that
 she


brought
 to
 this
 project
 as
 if
 her
 own


survival
 was
 at
 stake.
 There's
 just
 an


energy
 in
 the
 writing.
 It's
 beautifully


done.
 She
 she
 actually
 I
 believe
 and


Gilbert
 you
 can
 confirm
 this
 because
 you


talked
 to
 her
 for
 the
 podcast.
 She


wanted
 to
 write
 an
 article
 about
 people


living
 on
 house
 boats,
 people
 making
 the


decision
 to
 live
 at
 sea
 off
 of
 land.
 And


in
 researching
 for
 that
 article,
 she


came
 across
 a
 picture
 of
 the
 Bailey's


black
 and
 white.
 She
 wasn't
 setting
 out


to
 write
 about
 shipwrecks
 at
 all,
 but


she
 was
 just
 seized
 by
 the
 imagination


of
 this
 couple
 surviving
 this.


>> That's
 correct.
 And
 and
 I
 think
 what
 was


further
 alluring
 to
 her
 was
 the
 fact


that
 in
 looking
 at
 photos
 of
 people
 who


had
 been
 in
 shipwrecks
 and
 who
 had
 been


at
 sea
 and
 had
 survived,
 they
 were


almost
 all
 men.
 And
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 you


see
 this
 photo
 of
 a
 man
 and
 a
 woman.


She's
 like,
 "Who
 is
 that
 woman?
 What
 is


she
 doing
 there?"
 You
 never
 see
 women


out
 there
 in
 point.
 Marilyn
 is


remarkable.
 She
 took
 charge.
 Morris
 is


the
 dreamer
 and
 the
 social
 kmagin
 who


maybe
 originally
 introduced
 her
 to
 a


life
 of
 adventure.
 But
 Marilyn
 was
 the


one
 who
 was
 up
 to
 the
 task.
 She
 was


pragmatic.
 She
 did
 all
 the
 work.
 She


took
 care
 of
 him
 and
 nursed
 him
 along.


He
 was
 the
 one
 who
 fell
 ill
 more
 often


and
 she
 just
 became
 a
 tradife
 at
 sea.


[laughter]


>> Before
 we
 move
 on
 to
 our
 next
 title,
 I


want
 to
 ask
 this
 question.
 When
 I
 spoke


to
 Sophie
 Elmherst,
 the
 author,
 she
 said


she
 plays
 a
 game
 in
 her
 head
 sometimes


having
 written
 this
 book.
 And
 after


having
 written
 the
 book,
 it
 comes
 up
 at


dinner
 parties
 that
 she's
 at,
 which
 is


if
 you
 and
 your
 partner
 were
 in
 this


raft,
 who
 would
 be
 Maurice
 and
 who
 would


be
 or
 Morris
 and
 who
 would
 be
 Marilyn?


Who
 wants
 to
 answer
 that?
 [laughter]


Emily,
 who
 would
 you
 be?


>> I
 hate
 to
 say
 I
 think
 I
 would
 be
 Morris.


Morris.
 Morris.
 Let's
 remember
 to
 add


that
 after
 a
 couple
 days,
 maybe
 not
 even


that
 many
 on
 the
 raft,
 Morris
 said,


"Let's
 commit
 suicide."
 And
 Marilyn


said,
 "No."
 Unfortunately,
 I
 think
 I


would
 be
 Morris.


>> Greg
 Morris.
 Nema.


>> 100%
 Morris.
 But
 also,
 I
 want
 to
 say,


Emily,
 please
 don't
 do
 that.
 You'll
 pull


through.
 [laughter]


>> Okay.


>> Okay.
 Let
 us
 move
 on
 to
 a
 depressing,
 to


be
 frank,
 a
 depressing,
 but
 important


and
 moving
 book.
 Emily,
 you're
 going
 to


talk
 about
 this
 one.
 This
 is
 There
 Is
 No


Place
 for
 Us.


>> All
 right.
 There
 is
 No
 Place
 for
 Us
 by


Brian
 Goldstone.
 This
 is
 a
 predigiously


researched
 and
 reported
 book
 about
 a


phenomenon
 that
 affects
 hundreds
 of


thousands
 of
 Americans,
 but
 which
 has


gone
 basically
 unnoticed.
 And
 that
 is


the
 phenomenon
 of
 the
 working
 homeless.


And
 Goldstone
 points
 out
 right
 away
 that


the
 phrase
 itself
 sounds
 impossible.
 It


sounds
 like
 a
 contradiction
 or
 an


oxymoron.
 Why
 would
 someone
 with
 a
 job


not
 have
 a
 home?
 And
 unfortunately
 in


America,
 that
 describes
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 lot


of
 people.
 And
 I
 want
 to
 get
 one


statistic
 out
 of
 the
 way
 that
 he
 gives


us
 early
 on
 because
 I
 think
 it
 tells
 you


almost
 everything
 you
 need
 to
 know,


which
 is
 that
 apparently
 there
 is
 no


city
 in
 America
 where
 a
 full-time


minimum
 wage
 worker
 can
 afford
 to
 rent
 a


two-bedroom
 apartment.


So
 that's
 pretty
 discouraging.
 And


Goldstone's
 feat
 in
 this
 book
 is
 to


bring
 us
 into
 the
 lives
 of
 five
 families


in
 Atlanta
 where
 he
 lives
 whom
 he


followed
 for
 a
 very
 long
 time.
 We
 get
 to


know
 these
 families
 quite
 intimately
 for


whom
 working
 homeless
 describes
 their


lives.
 These
 are
 in
 one
 case
 at
 least
 a


twoarent
 family
 with
 a
 couple
 of
 kids.


In
 several
 other
 cases
 it's
 a
 single
 mom


with
 several
 kids.
 And
 for
 these


families,
 home
 is
 a
 car,
 a
 relative's


couch,
 or
 more
 typically
 a
 roach
 and


moldinfested
 room
 in
 an
 extended
 stay
 in


motel.
 This
 is
 a
 beautifully
 written


book.
 We
 really
 root
 for
 these
 families.


We
 rage
 with
 these
 families.
 And
 one
 of


the,
 I
 think,
 really
 artful
 things
 that


Goldstone
 does
 is
 make
 make
 clear
 that


there's
 not
 simply
 one
 factor
 that


accounts
 for
 why
 a
 family
 would
 fall


into
 this
 situation.
 Yes,
 the
 depressed


wage
 economy
 is
 a
 big
 culprit,
 but
 there


are
 many
 other
 variables
 that
 he


considers.
 Predatory
 real
 estate


companies,
 often
 run
 by
 private
 equity


firms
 far
 away,
 who
 will
 evict
 you
 if


you're
 so
 much
 as
 a
 day
 late
 on
 your


rent.
 A
 boss
 who
 won't
 give
 you
 a
 day


off
 to
 look
 for
 an
 apartment.
 Urban


development
 that
 favors
 growth
 over


affordability.
 In
 New
 York
 City,
 we
 just


elected
 a
 mayor
 who
 ran
 on
 a
 platform
 of


affordability
 and
 drew
 a
 huge
 turnout
 of


voters
 concerned
 about
 this
 issue.
 So,


this
 is
 a
 big
 problem.
 And
 finally,
 laws


that
 are
 designed
 to
 favor
 landlords


over
 tenants.
 And
 there's
 one
 story
 that


really
 stuck
 with
 me
 from
 this
 book
 that


I
 wanted
 to
 share
 about
 one
 of
 the


families.
 The
 head
 of
 household
 is
 a


woman
 whose
 rental
 home
 was
 burned
 down


by
 an
 arsonist
 and
 she
 was
 removed
 to
 a


shelter
 paid
 for
 by
 the
 Red
 Cross.
 And


then
 she
 found
 another
 apartment
 that


she
 could
 afford
 and
 she
 applied
 to
 rent


it.
 And
 the
 landlord
 said,
 "Actually,
 I


can't
 rent
 it
 to
 you.
 You
 have
 an


eviction
 on
 your
 record."
 M


>> and
 it
 turned
 out
 that
 even
 though
 her


rental
 home
 had
 burned
 down,
 her
 mailbox


was
 still
 standing.
 And
 in
 Georgia,
 the


law
 allows
 a
 landlord
 to
 simply
 send
 an


eviction
 notice
 by
 mail.
 And
 if
 it's


uncontested
 over
 a
 certain
 number
 of


days,
 the
 eviction
 stands.
 And
 so
 she


was
 unable
 to
 rent
 an
 apartment
 after


that.
 This
 is
 a
 book
 that
 really
 changed


how
 I
 looked
 at
 my
 environment.
 And
 I


think
 you
 look
 at
 the
 people
 you


interact
 with,
 an
 Uber
 driver,
 your


cashier
 at
 CVS,
 even
 a
 co-orker,
 and


wonder
 just
 because
 they
 have
 a
 job,
 do


they
 have
 a
 home?


>> Emily,
 I
 was
 so
 infuriated
 reading
 this


book.
 It
 made
 me
 so
 sad.
 Having
 grown
 up


in
 New
 York,
 I've
 always
 been
 surrounded


by
 the
 sights
 of
 people
 living
 on
 the


street
 and
 sleeping
 in
 subway
 cars.
 And


one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 Goldstone,
 you


know,
 really
 tries
 to
 to
 impress
 upon


his
 readers
 very
 quickly
 is
 we
 have


these
 preconceived
 notions
 of
 what
 it


means
 to
 be
 hopeless.
 Awful
 stereotypes


about
 what
 the
 types
 of
 people
 that
 are


homeless.
 You're
 living
 on
 the
 street,


you're
 living
 in
 a
 shelter.
 There
 are


many
 people
 that
 believe
 homelessness
 is


a
 moral
 problem,
 that
 you
 did
 something


to
 deserve
 it,
 that
 you
 have
 a
 substance


abuse
 problem.
 That's
 not
 the
 totality


of
 what
 it
 means
 to
 be
 homeless,


certainly
 in
 this
 country.
 And
 as
 you


well
 pointed
 out,
 the
 number
 of
 people


in
 major
 cities
 across
 the
 country,
 he


found
 five
 families
 in
 Atlanta
 who
 have


jobs,
 the
 thing
 you
 are
 supposed
 to
 do


if
 you
 are
 trying
 to
 support
 yourself


and
 your
 family
 and
 still
 cannot
 afford


to
 have
 a
 regular
 home
 is
 incredibly


depressing.
 I
 don't
 know,
 however,
 how


to
 tell
 people
 that
 it
 is
 depressing,


but
 it
 is
 also
 important
 and
 worthwhile


to
 read
 this
 book
 because
 once
 you
 get


into
 the
 lives
 of
 these
 the
 subjects


that
 Brian
 Goldstone
 focuses
 on,
 you


feel
 like
 you
 are
 in
 their
 lives.
 You


feel
 like
 you
 are
 rooting
 for
 them.
 You


are
 failing
 with
 them.
 You
 are
 sad
 for


them.
 You
 are
 sad
 with
 them.
 It's


incredible
 how
 immersive
 the
 book
 is.
 I


think
 that's
 absolutely
 the
 right
 word.


Yes,
 it
 is
 depressing.
 It's
 also


enraging.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 enraging
 part


the
 enraging
 part
 gives
 you
 energy
 as


well
 as
 sadness.
 So,
 please
 don't
 be


deterred
 by
 the
 subject
 matter.
 I
 think


there
 are
 so
 few
 books
 that
 actually


really
 affect
 a
 profound
 change
 in
 how


you
 see
 the
 world.
 And
 this
 is
 one
 of


those
 books.
 I
 think
 it
 belongs
 on
 a


shelf
 with
 Evicted
 by
 Matthew
 Desmond


and
 Invisible
 Child
 by
 Andrea
 Elliot.


recent
 books
 that
 have
 looked
 at
 the


American
 underclass
 in
 a
 new
 way.
 This


is
 just
 a
 really
 important
 book.


>> I
 I
 want
 to
 say
 recent
 books,
 yes,
 but


Matthew
 Desmond's
 Evicted
 was
 one
 of
 the


book
 reviews
 10
 best
 books
 almost
 a


decade
 ago.


>> Wow.


>> And
 it
 just
 highlights
 it
 makes
 this


book
 all
 the
 more
 disheartening
 but
 also


important
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 it
 shows


how
 little
 has
 changed
 in
 the


intervening
 years.
 If
 I
 can
 climb
 on
 a


soapbox
 and
 it's
 Goldstone's
 soapbox.


One
 theme
 running
 through
 this
 book
 is


the
 role
 that
 government
 could
 and


should
 play
 and
 that
 it's
 in
 in
 the


absence
 of
 market
 regulation
 or
 tenant


protection
 laws.
 All
 of
 the
 interested


parties
 here
 are
 acting
 completely


logically
 to
 improve
 their
 own
 stations


in
 life.
 from
 the
 private
 equity
 firms


to
 the
 landlords
 who
 evict
 the
 people
 or


sell
 in
 a
 rising
 market,
 leaving
 these


working
 people
 homeless.


>> So,
 how
 do
 we
 solve
 this
 problem?
 Right.


>> Right.
 It
 it
 makes
 it
 makes
 no
 allowance


for
 the
 tenants
 who
 are
 at
 the
 mercy
 of


a
 missed
 paycheck
 or
 an
 abusive
 ex.
 That


arsonist
 that
 you're
 talking
 about
 who


burned
 down
 her
 apartment
 was
 her


exartner
 who
 burned
 it
 down
 out
 of


revenge.
 or
 this
 Kafka-esque
 bureaucracy


that
 splits
 families
 up
 once
 boys
 are
 13


and
 no
 longer
 allowed
 to
 stay
 in
 the


same
 shelters
 as
 their
 mothers.
 So,
 the


problem
 is
 just
 so
 large
 and
 it
 is
 an


enraging
 book.
 You
 just
 come
 away


feeling
 like
 there's
 nothing
 to
 be
 done,


but
 also
 how
 important
 it
 is
 to
 do


something
 because
 it's
 so
 dehumanizing


for
 the
 people
 living
 through
 it.
 I
 know


certainly
 in
 this
 time
 when
 it
 feels


like
 the
 news
 is
 overwhelming,
 the
 idea


that
 you
 should
 read
 a
 book
 about
 the


working
 homeless
 in
 America
 is
 like
 a


convincing
 pitch.
 But
 I
 I
 think
 that


part
 of
 the
 reason
 that
 I
 read


non-fiction,
 hopefully
 that
 we
 in
 this


room
 read
 non-fiction
 and
 that
 people


out
 there
 read
 non-fiction,
 is
 to
 get
 a


greater
 sense
 of
 the
 world,
 both
 good


and
 bad.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 is
 good
 to
 feel


angry
 about
 things
 that
 are
 happening
 in


this
 country
 and
 around
 the
 world.
 And


this
 is
 an
 underknown
 problem
 in


America.


>> It's
 an
 undercounted
 problem.
 Goldstone


makes
 the
 point
 early
 on,
 these
 are
 the


hidden
 homeless.
 There
 are
 no
 statistics


for
 them
 because
 you
 can't
 count
 them


because
 technically
 they're
 not
 living


on
 the
 streets.
 They're
 not
 living
 in
 a


shelter.


>> The
 government
 doesn't
 keep
 track
 of


them.


>> Exactly.
 One
 thing
 to
 keep
 in
 mind
 is


the
 reason
 that
 this
 book
 stands
 out.


It's
 not
 the
 only
 book
 about


homelessness
 or
 pseudo
 homelessness
 out


there,
 but
 it's
 really
 propulsive


because
 it
 has
 this
 kind
 of
 unbelievable


fly
 on
 the-wall
 quality
 that
 never
 lets


up
 even
 when
 he
 is
 on
 his
 soap
 box


giving
 you
 statistics,
 telling
 you
 about


the
 history.
 And
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 best


examples
 is
 when
 he
 explains
 the
 housing


voucher
 program
 where
 one
 of
 his


subjects,
 Britt,
 gets
 one
 of
 these


coveted
 housing
 vouchers
 and
 he
 tells


you
 about
 the
 whole
 history
 of
 why
 she


currently
 is
 still
 unable
 to
 get
 a
 place


to
 live
 and
 uses
 her
 own
 family
 tree


descends
 down
 into
 her
 grandmother's


generation
 and
 explains
 what
 was
 going


on
 with
 section
 8
 housing
 and
 how
 the


city
 of
 Atlanta
 demolished
 a
 lot
 of
 it


or
 all
 of
 it
 in
 in
 part
 at
 the
 behest
 of


real
 estate
 lobbyists
 who
 said
 that
 this


was
 distorting
 the
 market
 and
 they
 all


really
 loved
 housing
 vouchers
 and
 then


lo
 and
 behold
 once
 the
 housing
 vouchers


spread
 and
 a
 lucky
 few
 like
 Brit
 have


them
 in
 their
 hand
 no
 one
 will
 take
 them


in
 because
 landlords
 find
 the
 paperwork


to
 be
 incredibly
 ownorous.
 They
 want
 to


be
 able
 to
 raise
 rents.
 And
 the
 fact
 he


never
 loses
 sight
 of
 Brit
 the
 whole
 time


he's
 giving
 this
 description.
 And
 that's


what
 kind
 of
 makes
 this
 superlative
 book


on
 this
 subject.
 H


>> getting
 angry
 all
 over
 again.
 Nema,
 take


us
 away.
 Take
 us
 into
 the
 past.
 I'd
 love


for
 you
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 biography
 on


this
 list.
 Wild
 Thing,
 a
 life
 of
 Paul


Goan.


>> Okay.
 This
 is
 a
 biography
 of
 the
 painter


Paul
 Goan
 that
 is
 in
 technicolor.
 There


are
 lush
 scenes
 both
 in
 Paris
 and
 French


Polynesia
 where
 Goan
 spent
 the
 last


years
 of
 his
 life.
 Sophisticated
 art


analysis.
 There's
 political
 complexity.


We
 learn
 that
 Goan
 was
 born
 basically


into
 privilege.
 He
 had
 to
 leave
 Europe


with
 his
 family
 during
 the
 revolutions


of
 1848
 in
 part
 because
 his
 grandmother,


we
 find
 out,
 was
 this
 radical
 leftist


feminist
 who
 the
 state
 really
 did
 not


like.
 So
 they
 went
 to
 Peru.
 The


grandmother
 died
 basically
 when
 they
 got


there,
 but
 they
 ended
 up
 with
 a
 family


relation
 who
 was
 wealthy.
 Goan
 had
 an


enslaved
 person
 as
 a
 servant
 when
 he
 was


growing
 up.
 And
 yet
 somehow
 when
 they


moved
 back
 to
 Europe
 kept
 calling


himself
 a
 savage
 from
 Peru
 and
 he
 had
 a


kind
 of
 radical
 political
 chip
 on
 his


shoulder.
 But
 then
 he
 became
 a
 a
 stock


broker.
 But
 then
 when
 the
 market
 crashed


[laughter]
 in
 the
 late
 19th
 century,
 he


he
 had
 been
 collecting
 all
 of
 these


painters,
 a
 lot
 of
 I
 believe
 both


impressionists
 and
 postimpressionists,


some
 of
 the
 heavy
 hitters
 of
 his


generation.
 And
 then
 he
 started
 to
 take


up
 the
 brush
 himself
 and
 he
 thought,


"This
 is
 how
 I'm
 going
 to
 make
 back
 my


family's
 fortune
 with
 mixed
 results
 and


and
 ended
 up
 toward
 the
 end
 of
 his
 life


in
 French
 Polynesia."
 One
 thing
 that


this
 biography
 hopes
 to
 show
 is
 that
 Gan


is
 seen
 as
 this
 sort
 of
 like
 lustful


monster.
 Suprio,
 the
 author
 of
 this


book,
 goes
 so
 far
 as
 to
 talk
 about
 four


teeth
 that
 were
 found
 in
 an
 old
 well


that
 seemed
 to
 prove
 that
 Goan
 didn't


have
 syphilis.
 I
 really
 was
 surprised
 by


how
 many
 people
 appear
 to
 have
 known


that
 Paul
 Goan
 had
 syphilis.
 It
 seems


like
 [laughter]


she
 o
 she
 opened
 the
 book
 one
 thing.


>> Yeah.
 Trying
 trying
 to
 say
 like
 he


didn't
 have
 syphilis.


>> Yes.
 And
 I
 went
 into
 the
 book
 thinking


that
 he
 had
 slept
 with
 my
 favorite


postimpressionist
 sister,
 Emil
 Bernard's


sister,
 Meline,
 but
 that
 turned
 out
 not


to
 be
 true.
 He
 was
 faithful
 to
 his
 wife,


Mate,
 for
 as
 long
 as
 they
 were
 married.


They
 had
 an
 acrimonious
 divorce
 with
 her


selling
 some
 of
 his
 collection.
 After


they
 divorced,
 he
 did
 it.
 It
 is


important
 to
 stay
 impregnate
 two
 teen


Polynesian
 girls.
 And
 it's
 disturbing
 no


matter
 how
 many
 times
 it
 is
 relayed
 to


us
 that
 the
 French
 age
 of
 consent
 at
 the


time
 was
 13.
 And
 that's
 a
 testament
 to


how
 thorough
 predo
 is
 in
 this
 portrait


unsparing,
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 leaves


you
 with
 so
 many
 kind
 of
 unforgettable


scenes.
 I
 think
 the
 one
 that
 stuck
 out


to
 me
 most
 is
 I
 think
 it's
 somewhat


common
 knowledge
 that
 but
 I
 didn't
 know


that
 Goan
 was
 there
 when
 Van
 Gogh
 just


before
 he
 cut
 off
 his
 ear
 and
 he
 sees


Van
 Go
 holding
 the
 razor
 in
 his
 hand
 and


does
 nothing
 and
 thinks
 for
 the
 rest
 of


his
 life
 I
 could
 have
 stopped
 this
 from


happening.
 This
 is
 a
 a
 haunted


biography.
 It's
 a
 a
 beautiful
 biography


and
 Goan
 really
 becomes
 the
 savage
 from


Peru.
 He
 insists
 that
 he
 is
 at
 the
 end


or
 the
 savage
 from
 abroad
 anyway
 when
 I


think
 he
 he
 writes
 a
 letter
 to
 a
 friend


near
 the
 end
 of
 the
 book
 when
 he's
 in


his
 declining
 years
 in
 French
 Polynesia


where
 he's
 become
 a
 kind
 of
 political


bombast
 invading
 against
 the
 colonial


administration
 that
 he
 would
 like
 to


come
 back
 to
 Europe
 and
 his
 friend
 says


no
 you
 are
 much
 more
 powerful
 where
 you


are
 this
 wild
 man
 sending
 missives
 from


abroad


>> this
 is
 I
 agree
 with
 everything
 you've


said
 Nema
 this
 is
 a
 beautiful
 book
 she's


such
 such
 an
 excellent
 biographer.
 She


is
 a
 prolific
 biographer.
 She's
 written


biographies
 of
 Nietze
 and
 Stinberg
 and
 I


think
 one
 or
 two
 other
 painters.


>> Edward
 Monk


>> Edward
 Monk.
 And
 so
 she's
 so
 in
 command


of
 the
 material.
 The
 book
 is
 dotted
 with


little
 aides
 about
 the
 art,
 close


readings
 of
 Goan's
 very
 innovative


paintings
 and
 ceramics
 and
 wood


carvings.
 He
 was
 a
 crazy
 man
 artist,


rejecting
 the
 impressionists
 templates


for
 how
 to
 paint
 color
 and
 really


inventing
 his
 entire
 new
 idiom.
 I
 would


say
 that
 this
 is
 the
 wittiest
 book
 maybe


among
 our
 our
 non-fiction
 best
 books.


It's
 got
 a
 very
 unassuming,
 low-key
 wit


that's
 just
 utterly
 a
 pleasure
 to
 read.


And
 you
 really
 feel
 that
 you
 get
 a
 sense


of
 the
 late
 French
 19th
 century
 through


the
 life
 of
 this
 man
 who
 knew
 so
 many


people,
 experienced
 so
 many
 highs.
 He


was
 extremely
 wealthy.
 We
 learned
 that


he
 owned
 14
 pairs
 of
 pants,
 an


extraordinary
 number
 when
 he
 was
 a


[laughter]
 stock
 ber.
 He
 kept
 a
 taxi


running
 on
 the
 curb
 while
 he
 worked
 at


this
 at
 the
 office.
 And
 then
 he
 w
 he


experienced
 abject
 poverty
 when
 he


literally
 had
 nothing
 to
 eat.
 Couldn't


afford
 to
 rent
 a
 room
 in
 some
 rural
 part


of
 northern
 France
 where
 he'd
 gone
 to


paint.


>> He
 worked
 on
 digging
 the
 Panama
 Canal.


Money
 was
 in
 the
 early
 days
 of
 his


marriage
 a
 constant
 struggle
 and
 a


source
 of
 their
 acrimony.
 Jenzelai
 Emily


who
 you
 edit
 every
 week
 reviewed
 this


book.
 She
 reviewed
 several
 of
 these


books
 and
 and
 she
 said
 of
 Predo,
 who
 as


you
 point
 out
 has
 written
 all
 these


biographies,
 she's
 everything
 you
 want


in
 a
 biographer.
 diligent,
 judicious,


and
 compassionate
 without
 being


indulgent.
 And
 I
 think
 those
 are


particularly
 important
 qualities
 to


bring
 to
 a
 story
 like
 this,
 which
 is


Nema.
 And
 as
 Greg
 just
 pointed
 out
 with


the
 Panama
 Canal,
 is
 so
 much
 more


sprawling
 than
 I
 thought
 Goan's
 life


would
 be
 going
 into
 this
 book.
 He
 just


he
 lived
 a
 global
 life
 in
 a
 way.


>> He
 absolutely
 did.
 And
 Jen
 said
 it


perfectly.
 And
 Nema
 is
 right.
 I
 think


there
 is
 this
 sense
 or
 there
 was
 this


sense
 that
 Gogan
 had
 been
 cancelled.
 He


had
 syphilis.
 He
 slept
 with
 minors
 in


polynia
 [laughter]
 the
 teeth
 and
 so
 he's


uncancled
 in
 this
 book
 in
 a
 very
 clever


undogmatic
 way
 where
 we
 see
 a
 very


complicated
 man
 who
 had
 a
 much
 more


interesting
 and
 complicated
 relationship


with
 colonialism
 than
 the
 cliche
 would


suggest.


>> Prito
 says
 in
 her
 introduction
 or


preface
 she
 lays
 out
 a
 statement
 of


intent.
 She
 says,
 "The
 recent
 appearance


of
 so
 much
 new
 material
 coinciding
 with


contemporary
 debate
 around
 his
 troubling


reputation
 made
 it
 seem
 important
 to


re-examine
 Goan's
 life.
 Not
 to
 condemn,


not
 to
 excuse,
 but
 simply
 to
 shed
 new


light
 on
 the
 man
 and
 the
 myth."
 And
 I


feel
 like
 that
 is
 exactly
 what
 she


accomplishes
 in
 this
 book.


>> Amen.


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 of
 the
 criticism
 which


came
 up
 in
 the
 discussion
 over
 this


book?
 We
 often
 have
 biographies
 on
 our


top
 10
 non-fiction
 books
 and
 a
 question


that
 was
 asked
 is
 why
 now
 and
 and
 Predo


tries
 to
 to
 make
 the
 case
 well
 it
 was


time
 for
 a
 reassessment
 but
 Emily
 I
 will


ask
 this
 to
 you
 in
 particular
 what
 do


you
 say
 what
 it's
 like
 why
 now
 why
 this


person
 now


>> well
 I
 think
 the
 introduction
 does
 offer


one
 explanation
 which
 is
 the
 recent


discovery
 of
 the
 teeth
 and
 their
 testing


and
 not
 finding
 in
 fact
 what
 they
 found


was
 that
 the
 teeth
 did
 not
 suggest
 that


he
 had
 been
 treated
 with
 mercury
 and
 the


various
 compounds
 that
 a
 cpholytic


person
 would
 have
 been
 treated
 with.
 So


you
 can't
 prove
 a
 lack
 but
 it's


suggestive.
 The
 teeth
 were
 suggestive.


And
 then
 this
 manuscript
 was
 also


recently
 discovered
 that
 was
 the


original
 manuscript
 of
 a
 book
 I
 guess


that
 Goa
 eventually
 wrote
 and
 to
 see


this
 the
 full
 version
 of
 it
 as
 he
 wrote


it
 was
 revealing
 of
 his
 advocacy
 for
 the


local
 people
 among
 whom
 he
 lived
 in


Polynia.
 And
 so
 those
 are
 her
 explicit


motivations,
 but
 my
 sense
 is
 that
 she


would
 have
 written
 this
 book
 without


those
 pieces
 of
 evidence
 coming
 to


light.
 I
 think
 that
 she's
 someone
 who's


interested
 in
 kind
 of
 European,


Scandinavian
 connections,
 her
 other


biographical
 subjects
 have
 that


connection.
 And
 in
 this
 case,
 Gogana


being
 French,
 his
 wife
 being
 Danish.
 I


think
 that
 may
 have
 been
 an
 appealing


thing
 to
 her.
 I
 think
 she
 just


understood
 that
 this
 was
 a
 very
 singular


man.
 his
 life
 is
 a
 wild
 ride
 and
 that


she
 had
 the
 tools
 to
 tell
 this
 story.


>> We
 are
 going
 to
 go
 from
 biography
 to


memoir.
 Nema,
 I'm
 going
 to
 come
 back
 to


you
 over
 here
 to
 talk
 about
 Mother
 Mary


comes
 to
 me
 by
 Arendi
 Roy.


>> This
 is
 a
 memoir
 by
 Arandati
 Roy,
 as
 you


said,
 the
 charming,
 cheerful,
 sardonic


activist
 and
 novelist
 who
 wrote
 the
 god


of
 small
 things.
 And
 it's
 really
 it's
 a


portrait
 of
 her
 life,
 but
 it's
 also
 a


portrait
 of
 her
 mother
 and
 how
 her


mother
 shaped
 her
 life.
 Her
 mother
 was


this
 dynamic,
 formidable
 figure
 who
 ran


this
 school
 that
 was
 nominally
 Christian


in
 Carerala
 in
 a
 pretty


uncchristian-like
 way.
 And
 she
 inspired


much
 fear
 and
 reverence
 in
 her
 pupils
 as


she
 did
 in
 her
 children.
 And
 she
 gained


a
 national
 reputation
 having
 fought
 a


lot
 of
 legal
 battles
 through
 her
 school.


but
 also
 she
 was
 an
 abusive
 mom
 and


there
 have
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 tell
 all


memoirs
 out
 lately
 about
 bad
 marriages


and
 bad
 parents.
 I
 think
 the
 most


obvious
 example
 is
 Janette
 Mccertie


searing
 I'm
 glad
 my
 mom
 died
 about
 the


abuse
 she
 got
 from
 her
 mother
 as
 a
 child


actress.
 But
 Arandati
 Roy
 states
 from


the
 very
 beginning,
 I'm
 not
 glad
 my
 mom


died.
 In
 fact,
 I
 thought
 she
 would
 be


alive
 forever
 and
 it
 was
 inconceivable


to
 me
 that
 she
 would
 go.
 And
 the
 thing


that
 Roy
 does,
 which
 is
 almost
 a
 magic


trick,
 is
 despite
 her
 mother
 who
 was


very
 unstable,
 shout
 at
 her
 children,


hit
 her
 brother
 for
 having
 a
 subpar


report
 card,
 is
 she
 somehow
 makes
 all
 of


this
 funny.
 It
 every
 chapter,
 it's
 hard


to
 pull
 out
 one
 sentence
 and
 say
 where


the
 jokes
 are,
 but
 every
 chapter
 is
 like


a
 comedian's
 tight
 10.


[laughter]


and
 she's
 able
 to
 somehow


show
 how
 Arandati
 Roy
 herself
 is


politically
 active.
 She's
 spoken
 out
 a


lot
 against
 the
 nationalist
 right-wing


government
 of
 India's
 current
 leader


Narendra
 Modi.
 And
 the
 way
 that
 she's


able
 to
 show
 how
 her
 mother's
 kind
 of


manic
 disposition
 and
 public
 face,
 both


these
 things
 helped
 make
 Arandati
 Roy


the
 person
 that
 she
 is.
 is
 what
 is
 so


engrossing
 about
 this
 book.
 You
 get
 a


lot
 of
 Easter
 eggs
 about
 this
 or
 that


personal
 detail
 ran
 its
 way
 into
 the
 god


of
 small
 things,
 her
 life
 as
 an


architect,
 her
 her
 run
 of
 success
 after


working
 on
 screen
 plays.
 But
 really,


when
 Mrs.
 Roy,
 as
 she
 refers
 to
 her


mother,
 just
 as
 all
 the
 children
 in
 the


school
 that
 her
 mother
 runs
 do,
 whenever


her
 mother
 is
 off
 stage,
 you
 just
 start


to
 miss
 her
 just
 like
 Arandati
 does.
 And


do
 you
 feel
 like
 you
 need
 to
 have
 read


the
 work
 of
 Arand
 Roy
 in
 order
 to
 enjoy


this
 memoir?


>> In
 fact,
 I
 did
 not.
 I
 have
 never
 read


The
 God
 of
 Small
 Things
 and
 I
 still


enjoy
 this
 memoir.
 [laughter]


>> It
 is
 a
 superlative
 book.
 She's
 just


such
 an
 excellent
 writer.
 We
 should
 say


The
 God
 of
 Small
 Things
 won
 the
 Booker


Prize
 and
 a
 subsequent
 novel
 was
 long


listed
 for
 the
 Booker
 Prize.
 You
 are
 in


the
 hands
 of
 such
 an
 excellent
 writer.


What
 I
 loved
 about
 this
 memoir
 was
 the


unscentimentality,


the
 completely
 matter-of-act
 way
 she


goes
 about
 recounting
 a
 seriously


abusive
 relationship
 with
 a
 parent
 who


was
 unstable,
 irrational.
 You
 never
 knew


when
 she
 was
 going
 to
 sweep
 all
 the


teacups
 off
 the
 table
 and
 throw
 them
 on


the
 floor.
 But
 yes,
 it's
 done
 with
 such


a
 light
 touch
 and
 so
 matterofactly
 that


it's
 humorous.
 And
 yes,
 I
 was
 aware
 too


that
 each
 chapter
 read
 like
 a
 standup


bit
 with
 a
 great
 kicker
 and
 it's
 just


it's
 upsetting
 and
 delightful


simultaneously.


>> When
 we
 discussed
 this
 book
 as
 a
 group,


one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 kept
 coming
 up,


people
 kept
 saying


>> Arendi
 Roy
 just
 seems
 like
 a
 great
 hang,


[laughter]


a
 great
 person
 to
 hang
 out
 with.
 And


this
 book,
 it's
 so
 disarming.
 She
 is


describing


a
 woman
 who
 is
 undeniably
 monstrous
 as
 a


mother,
 but
 it
 is
 a
 forgiving
 and
 fully


human
 portrait
 of
 her.
 Her
 mother


suffered
 from
 severe
 asthma
 and
 had
 to


take
 steroids
 from
 it.
 It
 affected
 her


weight.
 It
 affected
 her
 temper.
 I
 mean


that
 a
 lot
 of
 her
 rage
 was
 chemically


driven
 because
 of
 her
 health
 condition.


And
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 forgiveness
 comes
 from


Arendati


sense
 of
 her
 mother
 even
 growing
 up
 as


this
 political
 figure
 a
 fierce
 feminist


fighting
 for
 a
 better
 world
 for
 people


like
 Arendati
 herself.
 So
 even
 as
 her


mother
 was
 terrifying
 and
 punishing
 she


also
 thought
 well
 she's
 paving
 the
 way


for
 people
 like
 me.
 We're
 going
 to
 come


back
 here
 to
 the
 states
 with
 our
 final


book.
 This
 is
 Mother
 Emmanuel.
 Two


centuries
 of
 race,
 resistance,
 and


forgiveness
 in
 one
 Charleston
 church.


This
 is
 by
 Kevin
 Sack,
 who
 used
 to
 work


here
 at
 the
 New
 York
 Times.
 And
 Emily,
 I


recall
 you
 just
 stumping
 so
 so
 hard
 for


this
 book.
 Please
 tell
 us
 about
 it.


>> I
 blush,
 Gilbert.
 But
 this
 is
 a
 really


good
 book.
 Of
 course,
 Mother
 Emanuel
 is


a
 name
 seared
 into
 the
 minds
 of
 many


Americans
 as
 the
 site
 of
 a
 horrific
 hate


crime.
 Mother
 Emanuel
 being
 the
 African


Methodist
 Episcopal
 Church
 in


Charleston,
 South
 Carolina,
 where
 in


2015,
 a
 white
 supremacist
 shot
 and


killed
 nine
 members
 of
 a
 Bible
 study


class
 who
 had
 invited
 him
 into
 their


midst.
 This
 book
 is
 a
 searing
 account
 of


that
 tragedy,
 but
 it's
 also
 a
 lot
 more.


It's
 a
 powerful
 history
 of
 the
 black


church
 in
 the
 South,
 and
 ultimately
 it's


a
 history
 of
 the
 imation
 of
 race
 and


religion
 in
 America.
 And
 as
 Gilbert


said,
 Sack,
 the
 author,
 is
 a
 former


longtime
 New
 York
 Times
 reporter.
 He's


from
 the
 South.
 He
 went
 to
 school
 in
 the


South.
 And
 he
 was
 assigned
 by
 the
 paper


to
 cover
 the
 aftermath
 of
 the
 massacre.


And
 he
 quickly
 realized,
 as
 he
 explains


in
 the
 book,
 that
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 more


to
 this
 story
 than
 this
 terrible
 event.


Mother
 Emanuel
 wasn't
 just
 any
 church.


It
 was
 the
 first
 AM
 church
 in
 the
 South.


It's
 one
 of
 the
 oldest
 black


congregations
 in
 Charleston.
 And


Charleston
 is
 a
 city
 that
 was
 long
 at


the
 center
 of
 black
 life.
 It
 was
 the


heart
 of
 the
 slave
 trade.
 And
 of
 course,


it
 was
 the
 place
 where
 the
 civil
 war


began.
 So,
 so
 much
 symbolism
 converging


around
 this
 event,
 but
 Sack
 has
 it


completely
 under
 his
 control.
 He
 spent


10
 years,
 almost
 10
 years
 writing
 this


book.
 He
 actually
 moved
 to
 Charleston
 at


some
 point
 in
 the
 process.
 And
 it
 it
 is


another
 feat
 of
 research
 and
 reporting.


So
 he
 takes
 us
 through
 the
 night
 of
 the


massacre
 and
 and
 yes
 this
 is
 a
 visceral


unsparing
 account.
 We
 get
 to
 know
 each


of
 the
 victims
 and
 the
 survivors
 very


intimately
 but
 he
 does
 this
 with


enormous
 sensitivity
 and
 we
 then
 get
 to


know
 the
 church
 as
 well.
 This
 this


church
 is
 the
 protagonist,
 if
 you
 will,


for
 the
 book,
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 through
 line.


And
 it's
 an
 extraordinary
 structure


containing
 all
 this
 history.
 And
 we
 get


a
 history
 of
 Charleston,
 which
 turns
 out


to
 be
 fascinating.
 It
 was
 a
 very,
 very


wealthy
 city,
 one
 of
 the
 wealthiest
 in


the
 13
 colonies,
 and
 had
 from
 very
 early


on
 a
 substantial
 black
 population.
 By


the
 early
 19th
 century,
 it
 was
 more
 than


50%
 black,
 although
 most
 of
 those


residents
 were
 enslaved.
 And
 what
 this


meant
 was
 that
 the
 white
 authorities


were
 incredibly
 paranoid
 about
 the


possibility
 of
 insurrection
 and
 that
 the


rules
 and
 regulations
 governing
 black


life
 in
 Charleston
 were
 just


particularly
 draconian.
 You
 couldn't


walk
 down
 a
 street
 and
 sing
 if
 you
 were


a
 black
 resident.
 You
 couldn't
 raise


your
 voice
 in
 public
 if
 you
 were
 a
 black


resident.
 And
 you
 certainly
 did
 not
 have


the
 right
 to
 freedom
 of
 assembly,
 to


worship
 in
 a
 black
 church.
 It
 took
 a


walk
 out
 and
 a
 lawsuit
 in
 the
 early
 19th


century
 for
 the
 first
 black
 AM


congregation
 to
 form.
 And
 we
 also
 get


simultaneously
 a
 history
 of
 Methodism


which
 turns
 out
 to
 be
 fascinating
 too.
 A


strain
 of
 Christianity
 that
 offered
 a


more
 personal,
 intimate,
 even
 ecstatic


version
 of
 Christianity
 compared
 with


the
 dominant
 Calvinist
 tradition
 and


notably
 was
 abolitionist.
 And


tragically,
 the
 church
 as
 it
 expanded
 to


the
 southern
 slave
 states
 abandoned
 its


abolitionist
 stance.
 And
 so
 you
 see
 the


black
 church
 evolve
 not
 just
 as
 a
 site


of
 worship
 and
 faith,
 but
 as
 resistance


through
 reconstruction,
 through
 the


civil
 rights
 period.
 Martin
 Luther
 King


comes
 to
 speak
 there.
 Pastors
 are
 often


politicians,
 including
 the
 pastor
 who


was
 killed
 in
 2015.
 The
 Reverend


Clementa
 Pinkney
 was
 a
 very
 well-


reggarded
 beloved
 state
 senator.
 So,
 we


get
 all
 of
 this
 history
 and
 at
 a
 moment


when
 religion
 and
 race
 are
 so
 much
 a


part
 of
 our
 national
 politics
 and


conversation,
 this
 book
 just
 feels


incredibly
 timely
 and
 and
 essential.
 Our


reviewer
 Randall
 Kennedy,
 a
 Harvard
 Law


School
 professor,
 called
 it
 a


masterpiece,
 and
 I
 would
 not
 disagree.


Nema,
 I
 remember
 when
 we'd
 first


discussed
 this
 at
 a
 meeting,
 you
 were


just
 very
 impressed
 at
 how
 deep
 the


history
 was
 that
 was
 in
 this
 book.


>> The
 history
 really
 carries
 on
 far
 past


the
 Civil
 War
 into
 reconstruction,


showing
 how
 this
 church
 tried
 to
 be
 both


a
 moral
 anchor
 in
 American
 life
 while


also
 negotiating
 itself
 with
 American


political
 reality
 as
 any
 kind
 of


influential
 entity
 in
 any
 country
 might.


I
 do,
 despite
 what
 I
 said,
 I
 do
 think


actually
 this
 book
 really
 shines
 in
 the


bookends,
 in
 the
 descriptions
 of
 the


rampage,
 which
 make
 you
 feel
 like
 you're


about
 to
 be
 shot
 in
 the
 head,
 in
 the


mixed
 reactions
 to
 the
 forgiveness


offered
 to
 the
 asalent,
 Dylan
 Roof,
 by


the
 survivors,
 and
 finally
 in
 Roof's


remorselessness
 and
 the
 fight
 over
 how


money
 donated
 from
 around
 the
 country


became
 an
 issue
 in
 the
 wake
 of
 the


tragedy.
 It
 really
 shows
 how
 the
 present


and
 the
 past
 are
 these
 beacons
 that


bounce
 light
 off
 of
 each
 other.


>> Yeah.
 The
 book,
 Emily,
 you
 alluded
 to


this,
 is
 bookended
 by
 the
 tale.
 You
 have


the
 first
 couple
 chapters
 tell
 the
 story


of
 what
 happened
 that
 terrible
 night.


Towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 book,
 we
 get
 the


aftermath
 and
 the
 middle
 is
 really
 that,


you
 know,
 history
 of
 Charleston,
 history


of
 Methodism,
 history
 of
 the
 AM
 church.


But
 the
 structure
 is
 seamless.
 I
 thought


each
 of
 those
 parts
 flows
 into
 pretty


pretty
 well.


>> It's
 really
 tricky
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it


because
 there
 is
 no
 single
 protagonist


aside
 from
 the
 church
 itself.


>> Your
 idea
 of
 the
 church
 as
 the


protagonist
 is


>> he
 needed
 that.
 He's
 such
 an
 eloquent


writer
 though
 and
 it
 is
 beautifully


structured.
 It
 was
 smart
 to
 to
 frame
 the


book
 with
 the
 tragedy
 and
 its
 aftermath.

 the
 end
 of
 our


conversation
 here,
 I
 wanted
 to
 ask
 each


of
 you
 to
 mention
 a
 non-fiction
 book


that's
 not
 on
 this
 list
 that
 you


nonetheless
 really
 loved.
 I
 will
 go
 with


the
 biography
 Baldwin
 by
 Nicholas
 Bogs.


It's
 a
 biography
 of
 the
 writer
 James


Baldwin.
 The
 subtitle
 is
 a
 love
 story,


and
 this
 is
 a
 biography
 that


specifically
 looks
 at
 Baldwin's
 life


through
 the
 frame
 of
 his
 romantic


relationships,
 which
 previous


biographers
 have
 largely
 shied
 away


from,
 partly
 because
 Baldwin
 was
 gay
 and


was
 often
 involved
 with
 men
 who
 went
 on


to
 marry
 women
 and
 have
 families.
 And
 so


there
 was
 maybe
 a
 sense
 of


circumspection
 in
 uncovering
 those.
 And


also
 because
 it
 took
 some
 digging
 to


find
 out
 who
 those
 were.
 But
 where
 you


might
 feel
 a
 sense
 of
 purience
 knowing


that's
 the
 framing,
 it's
 in
 fact
 you


come
 away
 feeling
 this
 is
 an
 absolutely


necessary
 way
 to
 approach
 Baldwin's
 life


and
 work
 that
 love
 was
 such
 a
 resounding


theme
 through
 everything
 that
 he
 wrote


and
 you
 realize
 how
 intimately
 these


relationships
 affected
 his
 life
 and
 his


work.
 So,
 so
 that
 was
 a
 biography
 I


really
 enjoyed
 this
 year.

Let's
 see.
 I'm
 going
 to
 mention
 Dark


Renaissance
 by
 Steven
 Greenblat.
 This
 is


just
 a
 very
 exciting
 book
 by
 Greenblat,


the
 Harvard
 professor
 historian
 who
 is
 a


world
 authority
 on
 Shakespeare
 and
 the


English
 Renaissance.
 It's
 a
 biography
 of


the
 playwright
 Christopher
 Marlo
 who
 was


born
 in
 1564
 in
 Canterbury.
 He
 was
 born


just
 a
 couple
 months
 before
 Shakespeare


and
 lived
 a
 wild
 and
 crazy
 life.
 He
 may


have
 been
 a
 spy
 for
 the
 English
 crown


and
 he
 managed
 to
 write
 several
 really


important
 plays
 before
 being
 murdered
 at


the
 tender
 age
 of
 29.
 Greenblat's


thesis,
 his
 very
 bold
 claim
 in
 this
 book


is
 that
 it
 was
 Marlo,
 not
 Shakespeare,


who
 jumpstarted
 the
 English
 Renaissance


that
 before
 Marlo
 wrote
 Tamberlain
 and


Dr.
 Foustus,
 his
 most
 famous
 plays,


England
 was
 culturally
 speaking
 just
 an


incipid
 benol
 backwater.


This
 is
 quite
 a
 claim.
 And
 a
 moreover,


aside
 from
 the
 plays,
 Marlo
 just
 didn't


leave
 very
 much
 documentation
 about
 his


life.
 But
 that
 does
 not
 stop
 Greenblat.


He
 is
 so
 knowledgeable
 about
 the
 period


and
 such
 an
 excellent
 storyteller
 and


such
 a
 great
 close
 reader
 of
 the
 plays


that
 he
 really
 lays
 out
 and
 makes
 his


case
 and
 makes
 the
 book
 a
 thrill
 to


read.


>> That
 was
 Dark
 Renaissance
 by
 Steven


Greenblat.
 Nema,
 take
 us
 home.
 I'm
 going


to
 recommend
 Julia
 Yafi's
 Motherland:
 A


Feminist
 History
 of
 Modern
 Russia
 from


Revolution
 to
 Autocracy.
 And
 not
 just


because
 it
 puts
 one
 more
 mom
 or
 mother


title
 in
 our
 list.
 This
 is
 a
 really


fascinating,


very
 subtle,
 engaging,


at
 times
 funny,
 and
 interesting
 book


about
 Julia
 Yafy's
 own
 self-discovery.


She
 moved
 with
 her
 family
 to
 Maryland


just
 as
 the
 Soviet
 Union
 was
 falling


apart
 in
 1990
 when
 she
 was
 7
 years
 old.


Most
 of
 the
 older
 women
 in
 Yafy's
 family


were
 scientists
 or
 doctors.
 So
 this
 was


her
 vision
 of
 the
 Soviet
 world,
 a
 utopia


for
 women
 of
 intellect.
 But
 then
 she


goes
 back
 to
 Moscow
 as
 a
 journalist
 in


2009
 and
 discovers
 there
 really
 isn't


much
 of
 a
 vestage
 of
 this
 ideal
 in
 the


country
 and
 she
 wonders
 why.
 And
 she


goes
 back
 through
 this
 history
 to


discover
 that
 while
 there
 were
 many


women
 like
 the
 women
 in
 her
 family
 that


did
 exist,
 the
 Soviet
 Union
 again
 and


again
 fell
 short
 of
 its
 own
 ideals.
 That


is
 Motherland
 by
 Julia
 Yaffy.
