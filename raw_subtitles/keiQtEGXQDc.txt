And I think there's still a big education gap. A study bandied around a couple of weeks ago where it said 95% of businesses get no value from AI. But I think there it turned out it was like not the models that were bad. It's like the implementations of them were not great. So I think there's just a big education gap for how you should update your view of your own day-to-day tasks and apply what capabilities models have and think about, like, hey, should I be doing this task myself or can I farm it out to a model? And there's definitely a delta of companies that really get this done well and others that are basically clueless.
