Hi. I'm Atul Gawande.
I am a surgeon, a public health leader
and researcher,
and a writer. I'm the author of
4 New York Times bestsellers,
"Complications,"
"Better,"
"The Checklist Manifesto,"
and "Being Mortal."
One of the things that's interesting to me
is how different professions
approach
people improving their skills over time.
The common approach in a field like
medicine
is what I call the pedagogical approach.
You are going to
go to school forever.
You're going to get your 10,000 hours
of practice
in internship and residency,
in some apprenticeship or training, in one
way or the other.
And then you're going to be set loose on the
world. And part of being a professional is
the expectation
that you will improve yourself,
that you own responsibility now for the
fact that the technology will
change, the skills will change, and you
will go about the task of getting
to better performance yourself.
And then there are fields that take an
entirely different view of this.
I'm a tennis fan.
Roger Federer was my hero. And
Roger Federer —
number one player in the world —
had a coach.
And sports is the classic example — but
hardly the only one —
where the very top people in the
profession, at every step of the way, not
only did they have someone they hired and
paid for
to give them advice,
but they would
observe them,
pull apart
where they've fallen short, and
help them get to improvement
on the assumption that you cannot
improve yourself.
I was midway through my surgical career. I
had been
assiduously tracking my
surgical complications
and other measures of how I was doing as
a surgeon.
And I'd seen year on year
steady improvements.
And at about 10 to 12 years
into practice,
I found that I'd flattened out. I'd
reached a mid-career point where I wasn't
getting
that much better.
I wasn't really getting better at all.
It struck me that I might consider getting
a coach.
It was because of my tennis.
Here I was
midlife
in my tennis game as well, and I thought
nothing of paying some college
kid coming off of a tennis team
200 bucks an hour — alright, not
that much, but still, it was expensive —
to pick up my game. And they regularly
found ways
that I could do better.
And I thought, "Why don't we do this
in medicine?"
There are lots of other fields where it's
the case.
I happened to have a chance to interview
Itzhak Perlman,
the greatest violinist of his generation.
And I asked him,
"Why don't violinists
have coaches?"
And he said, "I don't know,
but I always had one."
I said, "What?" "Yes."
He had married
a professional violinist
who'd graduated
from Juilliard where they were in school
together: his wife.
And she
gave up her career
in being a violinist
to sit in the audience
and give him feedback
after every performance.
And that was, he said, critical
to how he became the violinist that he is.
That ability to have someone providing
an external
set of data
on your reality
is such an important part of changing
your mindset.
So I brought
a surgeon. I asked one of my
former professors
to come to the operating room and observe
me. It was doing one of the operations
that I had done
a couple thousand of these
thyroid cancer
procedures
in the past. It had gone extremely well.
Took
about just over an hour. I was kind
of feeling pretty high on myself. He'd
been sitting in the corner
taking some notes
when the patient had been
woken up and left the room, and we had time in
the lounge.
He had 20 minutes of things to tell me
about. "Did you notice that the light
that was shining in the patient's wound
had drifted off course, and you were only
getting indirect light?"
"Did you notice that
the
anesthesiologist
was struggling with the blood pressure
for about 10 minutes during the
operation
and wasn't telling you about that?"
"I noticed your elbow goes
up in the air. And if you move your feet a
little to the left,
that'll allow you to keep it down on your
side so you're always in full control."
It was amazing.
And I was able to
improve the outcome,
based on ongoing feedback. I had him come
in once a month,
and we produced
lower complication rates,
better outcomes,
and I was learning again, which I loved.
And then we
could set new goals,
like how could I be a better teacher
and coach
to my students.
For example,
the micromanager in me,
if there was bleeding, and they did not
control the bleeding immediately,
I would reach in and do it for myself.
And
I needed to let them struggle a
little bit.
And
so, he taught me to count to 30
in your head
before
you intervene.
I don't think I ever quite got
to 30,
but
getting to the point that I would let them
struggle and learn
along the way
was part of also improving how I was
as a professor of surgery.
The purpose of a coach
is to not
be the one to set the goals for a surgeon,
but instead to say,
"Here are the kinds of goals we can work
our way through. We can improve technique.
We can improve teamwork. We can
improve leadership.
We can improve teaching.
Where would you like to start? What would
you like to accomplish
over the next 3 months?"
That gives you a shared basis for saying,
"We now agree on what I'm going to
observe and help you with."
I have an executive coach as well.
You know, he's asked me to record
my meetings
so that he can — and get permission for him
to listen to a recording of the meetings —
so that he could give me feedback. "Did
you know
you spent
more than 70 percent of the time
doing the talking in this meeting?"
"No. There's no way."
"Well,
that is the reality.
So what's your goal on how much talking
you want to be doing next time? How can
you
get to that point? Can you start
the meeting
with questions
instead of statements?
Can you make sure you set
clear action steps
at the end of your meeting?" And that's the
difference between a teacher and a coach.
A teacher
is going to make deposits of knowledge
or skill,
but not necessarily
see your performance in an ongoing way
over time.
Circling back and helping you walk through
the process of change and improvement
is
the role of the coach.
