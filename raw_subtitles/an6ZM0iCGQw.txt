This time next week,
I will be at the Cape Canaveral
Space Force Base,
nervously awaiting the launch
of our first spacecraft.
Much about that setting
will be different from this one,
but there are a few things
that will remain the same.
For example, like now, in a week's time,
I will also be hoping
not to crash and burn.
(Laughter)
And like now, in a week's time,
I will again be wearing
my same lucky underpants.
That's not a joke.
(Laughter)
So what about the spacecraft next week
makes it so special that it warrants
a rare second weekly appearance
of said undergarment?
(Laughs)
It's because it will be the first time
that anybody has tried
to launch an AI data center to space.
More specifically,
we will be the first to launch
the Nvidia H100 chip to space,
which is about 100 times
more powerful GPU, or AI compute,
than has ever been in space before.
In fact, this spacecraft is the first step
in a much larger vision
to build almost all data centers in space.
And today I will make
the case for this idea.
The idea that the abundant energy
and cold temperatures in space
will soon mean that it makes
much more sense
to build data centers in space
than it does to build them on Earth.
But first, why do we need
more data centers?
Well, there's both a carrot and a stick.
As many of the speakers have mentioned,
the carrot is the promise of AI.
So that's things like new treatments
for cancer, self-driving cars,
a superintelligent companion
in everybody's pocket.
In order to realize the promise of AI,
we will need many more new data centers
and many more new energy
projects to power them.
So that's the carrot.
But there is also a stick,
which people don't like
to talk about as frequently.
And that is the very real risk
in being left behind
by competitor nations.
This comes with very, very real
national security implications for the US.
So we know we need more data centers,
but why not just carry on building them
on Earth as we have been?
Well, some forecasts suggest
that over the next just three years alone,
we will need an additional
50 to 100 gigawatts
or 50 to 100 new nuclear power stations,
in just the US alone
to meet the coming demand for AI.
Permitting and other constraints
mean that this is not possible.
And this is basically leading
to a dramatic rise in energy prices.
And we also are sucking up
rivers and reservoirs
to keep these data centers cool.
A few weeks ago, I was invited
down to Tucson, Arizona,
to meet with community leaders there.
Tucson recently became
the first city in the US
to unanimously vote to reject
a new data center proposal,
to a gigawatt scale-data center
proposal, in their community,
primarily due to concerns
about energy and water usage.
I spoke with many members
of the community.
They had been shocked to find out
that this new data center proposal
would have put a strain
on energy and water in the community
that would have been a detriment
for generations to come.
And it's not just Tucson,
this is happening in towns and cities
across the US and across the world.
Now, if you've ever seen a data center,
you will know that they are massive.
So it can be pretty difficult to imagine
what this kind of data center
could look like in space.
And so I would like to show you
a short 15-second clip
of what a huge five-gigawatt
data center in space might look like.
So here you see
a Starship-sized spacecraft,
and I'll talk about this later,
with a 100-ton module of chips
connecting to a five-gigawatt cluster
with a four-kilometer solar panel
with a one-kilometer radiator.
And don't worry, this won't
block out the sun or anything.
(Laughter)
So I do know this looks
a little bit wacky, by the way.
When we first released this video
a year and a half ago,
as part of our Y-Combinator launch,
we got roundly pilloried from all corners.
I thought I would share with you
a few of the more polite X comments
that we got a year and a half ago.
"This gotta be the dumbest shit ..."
(Laughter)
"This gotta be the dumbest shit
I ever seen or heard."
Fair enough, fair enough.
Each has their own opinion.
"I thought you nerds were supposed
to be good at science."
(Laughter)
And just to be clear,
I literally first got this message
when I was inside a particle
accelerator testing chips.
"Good luck trying to run
an h100 in space."
To be honest, this is
actually very generous.
I really appreciate the good wishes.
(Laughter)
And my personal favorite,
"This will never get off the ground,
in a very literal sense."
(Laughter)
It's true that revolutionary ideas
often sound stupid at first,
but sadly it also happens to be true
that most terrible ideas
also often sound stupid at first.
So how can you be certain
of which camp you're in
and be sure that you're not
in the second camp?
Well, it's important to reason
from first principles,
but I mean, to be very honest,
in order to know which camp you're in,
most oftentimes it is going
to involve taking some risk.
If you don't take some risk,
you're likely not doing
anything consequential.
So for us, to know definitively
if we can run an h100 in space,
the best way to do that is to build
a spacecraft and launch it to space.
And that's exactly what we're doing
with our first spacecraft
launching next week.
So given how controversial
and audacious this idea seems to be,
I thought I would share
a little bit of context
about how this idea came about,
and then share some of the pros
and some of the cons.
A few years ago,
I quite randomly on a weekend,
decided to take a trip
down to Starbase, Texas,
where SpaceX is building
their new Starship rocket.
This wasn't a work trip or anything,
I'm just a huge space nerd
and this is my idea of a fun weekend.
The first stop on the trip is
to what they call the Rocket Garden,
and it was the first time I had seen
the massive new Starship
launch vehicle that SpaceX is building.
This was impressive, but to be honest,
what really impressed me —
besides the Texas barbecue,
which is amazing —
what really impressed me
was that across the road
from where I'm standing,
behind the camera in this image,
they are building,
or they were building then,
by far the largest factory
I have ever seen.
They're building these
two Starship gigafactories
that are essentially pretty similar
to Tesla production lines,
in that they're designed such
that within two years
they will be rolling one Starship per day
off that production line.
This is interesting because
while the launch cost with reusability
might come down by 50 to 100 times,
the launch capacity, i.e. how many tons
per year you can get to space,
might go up by 1,000 times or more.
And how is that possible?
It's because Starship is the first-ever
fully reusable rocket.
So, for example, with the current
launch vehicle, Falcon 9,
if you build a new one
every day for a year,
at the end of the year, you still
only have one Falcon 9 upper stage
because it's dispensable.
Whereas with Starship,
if you build a new one
every day for a year,
at the end of the year
you have 365 starships
because they're reusable.
And it's not just SpaceX.
There's new rockets coming
from Blue Origin, Stoke Space,
Relativity Space and Rocket Lab.
Even if you have a pretty healthy
dose of skepticism
on their forecasts,
the coming capacity is just mind-blowing
and will be the real game changer.
So this coming capacity reminded me,
or got me thinking
about the concepts from sci-fi
that I remember reading about
as a kid or as a teenager
under the torch light at night.
In the 1940s,
Isaac Asimov first wrote
about the idea of space-based solar,
which is where you have
a huge solar panel in space,
and then you somehow beam that power down.
The problem with space-based
solar, though,
has always been that you lose
most of the energy
in transmission from space to Earth.
But with low-cost launch,
we now have the ability to move things
like data centers to space
close to the energy source,
to consume the energy there
and just beam down the results
so we don't lose the energy
in transmission.
I ran the numbers with my cofounders,
Ezra Feilden and Adi Oltean,
and we came to the conclusion
that if the launch cost gets
to around 500 dollars a kilo,
which is well within
Starship launch prices,
then the data centers in space
will be economically viable.
So that's how the idea came about.
But where does this 500 dollars
a kilo number come from?
And how is it that energy
for data centers in space
will be cheaper than on Earth?
Well, let's run a comparison
with a data center on Earth,
with a solar project on Earth
to power a data center,
because solar on Earth is the cheapest
form of energy we have right now.
So you have three big costs
with a solar project on Earth.
Number one is the cost of permitted land.
This is actually the biggest cost
or can be the biggest cost,
particularly in North America,
where it's linked to the energy price.
Number two, you have
the cost of battery storage
because you need to charge
the batteries during the day
so that you have power at night.
And number three, you have the cost
of the solar cells themselves.
So how does that compare
with a solar project in space?
Well, number one, on the plus side,
we don't need permitted land.
We don't need battery storage
because we're 24/7 in the sun,
and we need six times less solar cells.
Since one square meter
of solar panel in space
produces six times the energy
of one square meter
of solar panel on Earth.
But there's a few
additional costs in space.
So I mentioned we're going to need
six times less solar.
But there's one big cost,
which is we need the launch cost.
The launches to get the chips,
solar panels and radiators to space.
But now you can see very clearly
that there is clearly a breakeven point
where the launch cost is below
the cost of permitted land,
batteries and six times the solar.
And we see that launch cost to be around
500 dollars a kilo, as I mentioned,
which is well within range
of the Starship launch price.
I'll finish with this.
Earlier, I mentioned the competition
between nations for AI,
and over the last few years,
we've seen rising tensions
with the first hot war
in Europe in generations.
At its root, the biggest driver
of large-scale war
is competition for resources.
And over the coming century,
the biggest competition between nations
will be for energy and water
for data centers.
Some of you might know that in 1945,
the United Nations Charter
was first signed in this very room,
on this very stage
where I'm standing right now.
Look at the curtains in this image
and the chandeliers,
they are the same curtains
that you will see.
It happened in this room.
We might take it for granted right now,
but the United Nations
has helped keep us safe
since the second World War until now.
And as the grandchild
of two British World War II veterans,
the words of the charter,
the promise of their generation to ours,
still move me every time I think of them:
"We, the people of the United Nations,
determined to save succeeding
generations from the scourge of war,
which twice in our lifetime
has brought untold sorrow to mankind."
The most effective way
that we can save our own children
and grandchildren from the scourge of war
will be to stop competing
over the fundamentally
finite resources of Earth,
and to start utilizing the near
limitless energy of our solar system
and eventually of our galaxy.
In a week's time, I'll be watching
the first AI data center launch to space.
In ten years' time, most new data centers
will be being built in space
for the energy.
And who knows, maybe in 50 years' time,
if I keep wearing my lucky underpants --
(Laughter)
We may have started work on a Dyson sphere
to help harness the full power of our sun.
Thank you.
(Applause)
