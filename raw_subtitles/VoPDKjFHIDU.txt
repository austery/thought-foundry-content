One evening, I was fast asleep
in our tiny two-room apartment
when suddenly the phone began to ring.
So I stumbled across the darkened space
and I picked up the receiver
and I heard a strange voice
telling me that my father
had been rushed into the hospital.
Naturally, I went to be by his side,
and for 14 days and nights my mother
and I sat right next to him,
urging him on.
But one quiet Sunday morning,
the zigzagging line on the screen
next to his bed flattened out,
and two men in black came
to carry my father away.
And I suddenly realized,
as my parents’ only child,
it was now all up to me
to console my grieving mother,
to organize the memorial service
and the obituary,
to notify friends, to alert the banks.
It was really the busiest time I've known.
So what did I do?
Well, one morning,
when I was sure that my mother
was well looked after,
I got into my carm
and I drove for four hours
along narrow, winding roads
up the Californian coastline.
And I got out in a place
of thrumming silence,
high above the sea,
and sat on a bench overlooking the water.
I let my anxious thoughts recede
and gave myself over
to everything around me.
The bells tolling now
and then down the road,
the water pooling around the rocks,
the bees buzzing around the lavender,
the wind whistling
through the pampas grass.
Finally, after two hours,
completely washed clean
by this kind of living silence,
I got back into my car and drove home,
knowing exactly what I had to do and say.
I trust the deepest kind of silence
because it doesn't leave
room for argument.
Let me put that differently.
It's hard to doubt what hasn't been said.
Silence doesn't ask us
to prove or disprove a thing.
Words so often cut us in two.
I believe this, and you believe that.
I voted for that person,
you voted for this one.
I know I'm in the right,
which means you must be in the wrong.
But when we're joined together
in a moment of silence,
we're united somewhere far deeper
than our assumptions or our ideologies.
And I know many of you find this
through yoga or meditation
or other such disciplines,
but for any of us who finds
those a little daunting or difficult,
the beauty of silence is
it's available to everyone,
wherever you happen to be.
And in this world that feels
ever more divided and despairing,
nothing gives me greater hope
than whatever silence
we can find and share.
You all know it's not always like this.
I'm sure many of you have been
on the receiving end of a sullen silence,
a threatening silence,
a silence that breaks your heart open
in a room that's suddenly empty.
Unfortunately, most of us know
how to make silence a weapon or a shield.
To draw somebody out or to draw her in.
Where were you last night?
The silence that follows can be worse
than a lie and even than the truth.
But the silence I'm talking about
is something positive and alive
that you can almost touch.
For me, it's like stepping out
of your social, skyscraper self
and wandering out into a vast open meadow.
Getting out of your head
and coming back to your senses.
Just about all of us are bombarded
by more agitation and distraction
than we know what to do with,
and it's intensifying
with every passing moment.
And all we're crying out for
is a way to cut through the noise.
Sirens down on the street,
the updates streaming in,
those drills constructing yet another
hundred-storey high-rise.
The chatter in our heads.
We can't hear ourselves think.
We can't even hear
what that friend is saying.
Somebody's cell phone is ringing.
"Sorry, I've got to take this."
"Did you hear what just happened
in the Middle East last night?"
The airwaves fill with curses and opinions
and predictions and judgments.
And all we're longing for
is some blessed silence.
I've been lucky enough for almost
half a lifetime now, 34 years,
to find a kind of pulsing silence
by going to stay
for two weeks or two days,
or even in the wake of my father's death,
two hours,
in a Catholic retreat house.
Which is funny because
I’m not even a Christian,
and I'm not really a religious person.
But as soon as I step
into that wide awake silence,
all the worries that have been clacking
away at me on the long drive up,
all the plans and debates and arguments,
they all fall away,
and I can hear myself not think.
Better than that,
I can be filled up
with everything around me
that's much larger than I will ever be.
The breeze and the birdsong
and the receding whoosh of the ocean
down below.
I notice things that I would never see
when my mind is filled with words,
the light on the water or those rabbits
scuffling through the undergrowth.
And of course, it's easiest of all
if you're in a beautiful, natural setting.
But even if you're in a busy city,
just step into a church
or sit quietly in one corner of your room
without your devices, for 20 minutes
and you can taste something of the same.
We're really most alive when we're silent
because we're most responsive
to everything around us.
And after I tried this medicine
of just sitting quietly a few times,
I noticed something strange.
I was thinking much more fondly
about my friends
when I wasn't saying a word.
In fact, often they seemed closer to me
when I was sitting in silence
than when they were talking to me
in the same room.
I could also register exactly
what I should be doing
six months from now,
which is precisely
what is usually drowned out
when my monkey mind is fretting
about what I should do
six minutes from now.
I really feel that the deepest part of us
lies beyond all words.
And again, I know this isn't
100 percent guaranteed.
Sometimes when I make
that four-hour drive
up to the retreat house,
all I hear all night long
is the rain pattering on the roof
and the aged heater
groaning in the winter cold
and the very foundations
of the cabin in which I'm sitting,
shaking in the wind.
But silence so reliably
offers me a sense of release
that I realise it's the best
investment I will ever make.
Because when reality makes a house call,
as it will more than once in every life,
when suddenly the phone does begin
to ring in the middle of the night,
or nurses race into the room
to feel for a pulse,
the only thing you have to draw upon
is your inner savings account.
Which for me really consists of such
inner resources as you’ve gathered,
probably just by sitting quietly alone.
And I realize this can all sound
a little otherworldly, but to me,
it's as practical
as going to the health club.
The emotional or mental health club.
Silence doesn't ask me to believe anything
or to fret about non-believers.
And it really touches something inside me
that no scripture can ever reach.
When your mind is silent,
wrote Thomas Merton,
who, as a monk lived on closest terms
with silence for 27 years,
then the forest suddenly
becomes magnificently real.
Your phone is ringing right now, I’m sure.
Cable news is reporting
some breaking development.
Talk radio is filling up with responses
to that development.
You’re worried about where
you have to be this afternoon.
You’re fretting about why Susan said
that hurtful thing to you last night.
I hear you.
But when you fall in love
or when somebody you love dies
or when you step out into that sunrise,
the truest words that come to you
may be none at all.
We're all worried, as we should be,
about the climate crisis and wars
and technologies that are racing
outside our control.
But not far away is a place
where debates are beside the point,
and where actually we gather
the reserves we need
to deal with wildfires
and the refugee crisis
and shattered economies.
A place where we hear an intelligence
that isn't artificial at all.
So take a deep breath
and step for a moment, or two hours,
into a place where no words are required.
Nothing bad can come of it,
and something good,
possibly very helpful, may likely emerge.
Maybe we can just all try this together
by joining in a long moment
of saying nothing.
After a long week of words,
what a moment to share.
Thank you so very much.
(Applause)
