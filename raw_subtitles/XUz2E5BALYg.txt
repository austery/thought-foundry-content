>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 Odd
 Thoughts
 podcast.
 I'm
 Tracy


Aloway


>> and
 I'm
 Joe
 Weisenthal.


>> Joe,
 I
 have
 a
 confession
 to
 make.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 online
 shopping.
 Like
 a


lot.
 More
 than
 is
 healthy.
 Probably


>> more
 than
 I
 realize
 from
 looking
 over


your
 shoulder
 in
 the
 office
 and
 asking


you
 what
 you're
 looking
 up
 because
 I
 do


do
 that
 and
 you
 never
 like
 it,
 but
 I


still
 do
 it.


>> No,
 because
 sometimes
 I
 am
 in
 fact


shopping
 online
 in
 the
 office.
 But
 a
 few


years
 ago,
 I
 noticed
 a
 phenomenon,
 a


change
 when
 it
 came
 to
 online
 shopping.


You
 know
 what
 that
 was?


>> I
 can
 guess.


>> Yeah.
 All right.
 All
 of
 a
 sudden,


whenever
 I
 was
 checking
 out,
 you
 would


get
 an
 offer,
 a
 little
 button
 usually


that
 would
 say,
 "Do
 you
 want
 to
 take
 a


buy
 now,
 pay
 later
 option,
 and
 usually


it's
 with
 a
 company
 like
 CLA
 or
 a
 firm


or
 something
 like
 that?"


>> They're
 everywhere
 now.


>> So,
 like
 I've
 certainly
 seen
 all
 these


buttons.
 I've
 never
 used
 it.
 I
 don't


really
 know
 why
 I
 haven't
 because
 like


why
 shouldn't
 I
 spread
 out?
 Why


shouldn't
 I?
 Like
 for
 real,
 like
 my


understanding
 is
 that
 the
 core
 of
 the


business
 model
 works
 is
 that
 there's
 no


like
 formal
 interest,
 right?
 So
 if
 you


make
 a
 $100
 purchase,
 you
 get
 to
 spread


it
 out
 say
 in
 four
 payments
 of
 $25.
 And


so
 whether
 it's
 $100
 right
 now
 or
 $100


in
 four
 months,
 it's
 the
 same
 from
 the


end
 buyer,
 which
 of
 course
 in
 theory


because
 there's
 a
 time
 value
 of
 money
 is


not
 intuitive.
 But
 the
 idea
 is
 that
 the


retailer
 implicitly
 pays
 the
 interest


because
 it's
 a
 form
 of
 customer


acquisition.
 And
 so
 the
 retailer
 is


implicitly
 willing
 to
 take
 a
 $100
 or


whatever
 over
 x
 period
 of
 time
 rather


than
 all
 at
 once
 in
 exchange
 for


essentially
 making
 it
 easier
 for


customers
 to
 buy.
 But
 from
 the
 customer


perspective,
 like
 you
 and
 me
 who


presumably
 have
 the
 money
 to
 make
 to
 buy


what
 we're
 purchasing,
 I
 still
 don't
 get


why
 we
 don't
 all
 use
 buy
 now
 pay
 later


because
 why
 not
 spread
 out
 our
 purchases


further
 out
 into
 the
 future.


>> You
 know
 how
 Rebel
 Wilson
 described
 it


in
 a
 firm
 commercial.


>> I
 didn't
 I
 don't
 I
 haven't
 seen
 it.


>> Like
 eating
 a
 tub
 of
 ice
 cream
 but


spreading
 out
 the
 calories
 over
 four


weeks.


>> Exactly.
 Why
 don't


>> it's
 still
 600
 calories,
 right?
 That's


the
 issue.
 But
 I
 think,
 okay,


>> so
 this
 is
 obviously
 a
 nuance
 subject.


>> Yes.


>> So
 clearly
 0%
 interest
 doesn't
 sound


like
 a
 problem,
 but
 obviously
 if
 you


fail
 to
 pay,


>> right,


>> you
 pay
 a
 penalty
 fee,


>> then
 you
 then
 the
 penalties
 start


building
 up,


>> right?
 So
 there's
 that.
 But
 the
 other


issue
 with
 some
 of
 these
 buy
 now
 pay


later
 items,
 and
 it's
 really


interesting.
 I
 kind
 of
 think
 about
 this


as
 a
 parallel
 to
 the
 private
 market
 in


credit.
 So
 this
 idea
 that
 there's
 this


like
 whole
 world
 of
 additional
 credit
 or


leverage
 that
 we
 don't
 actually
 have


very
 good
 data
 on.
 Yeah.
 And
 that
 is


growing,
 right?
 I
 think
 that
 is
 the
 key.


>> So
 here's
 how
 I
 see
 the
 issue,
 which
 is


that
 if
 I
 could
 have
 a
 tub
 of
 ice
 cream


and
 spread
 out
 the
 calories
 over
 four


months,
 I
 would
 certainly
 do
 that.
 That


sounds
 pretty
 great
 because
 I
 burn
 a


certain
 number
 of
 calories
 in
 a
 day.
 And


so
 if
 I
 had
 four
 months
 to
 burn
 them,


that
 that
 would
 be
 far
 more
 efficient.


But
 the
 flip
 side
 is,
 well,
 I
 would
 eat


more
 ice
 cream.
 So,
 so
 I
 would
 eat
 four


times
 I
 would
 eat
 four
 times
 as
 many


tubs
 of
 ice
 cream
 in
 that
 given
 day


knowing
 that
 I
 have
 this
 fourmonth


calorie
 budget.
 And
 so
 then
 you
 still


get
 the
 question
 of
 like,
 okay,
 maybe


there's
 not
 a
 formal
 interest
 or
 maybe


there's
 penalties,
 but
 I'm
 buying
 a
 lot


more
 with
 today's
 buying
 power.
 And
 that


may
 still
 yet
 prove
 to
 be
 unsustainable


to
 the
 end
 consumer
 even
 if
 it
 doesn't


formally
 clock
 as
 what
 we
 measure
 as


consumer
 debt.
 Here's
 the
 added
 layer.


Let's
 say
 you're
 trying
 to
 lose
 weight


or
 trying
 to
 be
 healthy
 and
 you
 have


like
 a
 dietician.


>> Imagine
 eating
 the
 ice
 cream
 but
 him


never
 knowing
 that
 you're
 eating
 the
 ice


cream,
 right?
 Like
 this
 is


>> Well,
 I
 I
 lie
 to
 my
 doctors
 all
 the


time.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 used
 to
 that.


>> Okay.
 All right.
 Rather
 than
 us
 debate


this,
 we
 do
 in
 fact


>> how
 much
 didn't
 do
 you
 Well,
 you
 know,


like
 once
 a
 week
 I
 like
 go
 through
 a
 3


milligram
 thing.
 I
 did
 actually
 quit
 and


I'm
 saying
 it
 but


>> you
 told
 me
 this
 this
 morning.
 You
 said


you
 were
 not
 going
 to
 z


us
 talk
 about
 this,
 we
 do
 in
 fact
 have


the
 perfect
 guest.
 We're
 going
 to
 be


speaking
 with
 Julie
 Morgan.
 She
 is
 a


president
 of
 the
 Century
 Foundation,


formerly
 at
 the
 Consumer
 Financial


Protection
 Bureau,
 the
 CFPB,
 where
 she


thought
 a
 lot
 about
 the
 buy
 now
 pay


later
 phenomenon.
 So
 we're
 going
 to
 get


some
 of
 her
 thoughts
 right
 now.
 Julie,


welcome
 to
 the
 show.


>> Thank
 you.
 I'm
 so
 excited
 to
 be
 here.


>> So,
 how
 did
 this
 happen?
 Like,
 how
 did


this
 business
 model
 actually
 come
 about?


Because
 it
 it
 felt
 very
 sudden
 to
 me,


but
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 I
 was
 outside
 of


the
 US
 for
 a
 long
 time,
 so
 maybe
 it
 was


quite
 gradual.


>> I'm
 really
 excited
 to
 answer
 this


question
 for
 a
 number
 of
 reasons,


including
 the
 way
 that
 you
 all


introduced
 this
 because
 you
 spent
 a
 lot


of
 time
 talking
 about
 buy
 now,
 pay
 later


as
 this
 pay
 infor,
 zero
 interest,
 maybe


like
 no
 fee
 or
 low
 fee
 model.
 And
 we
 did


see
 that
 model
 arise
 during
 the
 pandemic


and
 become
 a
 much
 more
 salient
 part
 of


the
 way
 consumers
 were
 paying
 for
 goods


during
 the
 pandemic.
 And
 so
 if
 I
 could


take
 you
 back
 to
 kind
 of
 those
 early


years
 at
 the
 CFPB
 where
 we're
 coming
 out


of
 the
 pandemic,
 we're
 seeing
 this
 rise


in
 buy
 now
 pay
 later.
 You
 know,


regulators
 and
 researchers
 started
 to


investigate
 this
 to
 understand
 what
 it


meant
 for
 consumers
 and
 what
 the
 risks


were.
 And
 I
 think
 there
 were
 kind
 of
 two


fundamental
 assumptions
 about
 buy
 now


pay
 later
 at
 that
 time.
 One
 was
 just


what
 we
 said.
 It's
 a
 payinfor


no
 interest
 low
 or
 no
 fee
 model.
 And


then
 two
 people
 were
 using
 this
 in
 kind


of
 the
 like
 what
 I
 think
 of
 as
 a


stereotypical
 Gen
 Z
 kind
 of
 way.
 They


were
 using
 it
 to
 finance
 a
 purchase
 that


was
 slightly
 larger
 or
 more
 extravagant


than
 what
 they
 would
 have
 bought.
 And
 it


was
 usually
 on
 something
 like
 a
 purse
 or


an
 item
 of
 clothing.
 What
 we
 found
 over


time
 is
 that
 both
 of
 those
 assumptions


turned
 out
 to
 be
 wrong.
 Right?
 So
 number


one,
 what
 we're
 seeing
 right
 now
 as
 buy


now
 pay
 later
 and
 calling
 buy
 now
 pay


later
 is
 not
 in
 fact
 always
 that
 pay


inforest


product.
 And
 in
 fact
 many
 of
 the


companies
 that
 we
 associate
 with
 buy
 now


pay
 later
 like
 a
 firm
 or
 CLA
 are
 mostly


not
 offering
 that
 product.
 So
 a
 firm


says
 that
 product
 is
 only
 20%
 of
 their


business.
 The
 rest
 of
 their
 business
 is


what
 I
 would
 think
 of
 as
 like
 a
 like


point
 of
 sale
 loans
 or
 short-term


installment
 loans
 with
 interest
 rates


ranging
 from,
 you
 know,
 10
 to
 30%
 and


terms
 that
 range
 from
 30
 days
 to
 6
 or
 18


months.


>> So,
 it's
 buy
 now
 pay
 later,
 but
 it's


more
 like
 just
 a
 formal
 loan.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,


>> it's
 payment
 in
 installment
 and
 there's


a
 schedule,
 but
 also
 there
 is
 a
 nominal


interest
 rate
 that's
 visible
 to
 the


consumer.


>> Exactly.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 is
 buy
 now
 pay


later
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 any
 loan


including
 your
 mortgage
 is
 buy
 now
 pay


later.
 Right?
 So
 they've
 they've
 kind
 of


kept
 this
 this
 marketing
 that
 I
 think


was
 really
 appealing
 to
 consumers
 and


that
 sort
 of
 soothed
 regulators


>> that
 these
 products
 were
 fairly
 low
 risk


and
 then
 started
 shifting
 that
 into


these
 products
 that
 look
 very
 different.


>> Okay.
 whether
 we're
 talking
 about
 the


new
 products
 or
 the
 sort
 of
 the


traditional
 BNPL
 the
 way
 Tracy
 and
 I


described
 it
 in
 the
 beginning
 currently


what
 kind
 of
 collection
 of
 data
 like


when
 that
 happens
 so
 we
 know
 like
 credit


card
 data
 gets
 collected
 there
 is
 public


statistics
 about
 just
 the
 sheer
 volume


of
 credit
 cards
 what
 do
 we
 have
 right


now
 in
 terms
 of
 where
 this
 gets
 slotted


and
 how
 it's
 collected
 as
 data


>> yeah
 we
 don't
 have
 a
 ton
 so
 we
 have
 a


couple
 of
 different
 ways
 of
 looking
 at


buy
 now
 pay
 later
 most
 of
 It
 is
 through


government
 sources.
 So
 the
 Federal


Reserve
 and
 the
 CFPB
 have
 the
 ability
 to


pull
 data
 from
 the
 companies.
 And
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 CFPB's
 reports
 on
 buy
 now


pay
 later,
 that
 is
 what
 they're
 doing.


They're
 pulling
 transaction
 level
 data


through
 market
 monitoring
 orders.
 That's


not


>> these.
 But
 when
 you
 say
 market


monitoring
 orders,
 just
 to
 be
 clear,
 the


companies
 are
 compelled
 to
 regularly


update
 the
 CFPB
 with
 some
 level
 of
 data.


>> They're
 compelled
 to
 provide
 data,
 the


regularly
 piece
 is
 not
 part
 of
 it.
 So


this
 tends
 to
 be
 a
 oneoff,
 right?
 we


don't
 have
 a
 consistent
 stream
 of
 data


coming
 from
 the
 companies
 and
 so
 that


gives
 us
 like
 a
 small
 window
 into
 what's


happening
 in
 the
 buy
 now
 pay
 later
 space


but
 it's
 really
 not
 enough
 and
 then
 we


have
 survey
 data
 and
 that's
 where
 you


see
 lending
 tree
 and
 Axios
 and
 others


asking
 consumers
 and
 I
 I
 think
 it's


important
 to
 understand


>> that
 there
 you're
 just
 kind
 of
 getting


what
 the
 consumer
 thinks
 they
 have
 and


it's
 it
 really
 inhibits
 our
 ability
 to


get
 at
 are
 you
 using
 paying
 for
 are
 you


paying
 interest
 and
 all
 those
 things.


>> How
 does
 buy
 now
 pay
 later
 fit
 into


private
 credit
 scores
 like
 FICO,
 right?


Because
 I
 imagine,
 you
 know,
 if
 you're


applying
 to
 a
 bank,
 they're
 going
 to


look
 at
 your
 FICO
 score
 if
 you
 want


something
 like
 a
 mortgage.
 And
 even


though
 buy
 now
 pay
 later
 seems
 to
 be
 for


mostly
 smaller
 items
 at
 the
 moment.
 So


maybe
 you
 owe
 like
 a
 couple
 hundred
 or


something
 via
 a
 firm,
 maybe
 you
 also
 owe


a
 few
 thousand
 via
 CLA,
 right?
 And
 I


imagine
 if
 you're
 a
 bank
 using
 FICO


scores,
 you
 would
 want
 to
 know
 that


information.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 we
 don't
 know
 this
 information


right
 now.
 FICO
 announced
 recently
 that


they
 plan
 to
 start
 using
 buy
 now
 pay


later
 as
 part
 of
 their
 scoring
 model.


And
 we've
 seen
 the
 companies
 be


extraordinarily
 resistant
 to
 that.
 So,


CLA
 and
 others
 are
 saying
 that
 they're


not
 going
 to
 turn
 over
 data
 until
 they


get
 certain
 asurances
 from
 FICO
 about


how
 how
 that
 data
 is
 going
 to
 be
 used.


So
 the
 what
 we
 have
 right
 now
 is
 kind
 of


snapshots
 in
 time
 to
 understand
 how


people
 are
 stacking
 you
 know
 buy
 now
 pay


later
 on
 top
 of
 credit
 card
 debt
 and
 on


top
 of
 other
 products
 and
 the
 research


that
 we
 have
 there
 which
 is
 somewhat


limited
 does
 suggest
 that
 people
 are


stacking
 this
 you
 know
 it
 tells
 us
 that


about
 60%
 of
 the
 people
 who
 are
 using


buy
 now
 pay
 later
 have
 a
 subprime
 credit


score
 it
 tells
 us
 that
 they
 are
 mostly


using
 it
 on
 top
 of
 credit
 card
 debt
 and


it's
 also
 suggesting
 that
 before
 people


take
 on
 buy
 now
 pay
 later.
 There's
 a


slight
 uptick
 in
 their
 use
 of
 their


credit
 card.
 So,
 there's
 a
 suggestion


that
 it's
 really
 like
 you're
 maxing
 out


one
 form
 of
 debt
 and
 then
 taking
 on


another.


>> I
 just
 looked
 up
 the
 Q2
 New
 York
 Fed


household
 debt
 report.
 I
 think
 it
 just


came
 out
 a
 few
 days
 ago.
 I
 must
 have.


It's
 Q2.
 Anyway,
 it
 says
 there's
 1.21


trillion
 in
 total
 credit
 card
 balances


outstanding.
 Do
 we
 have
 something
 that


we
 have
 a
 guess
 for
 what
 is
 the
 number


of
 BNPL
 loans
 of
 any
 form
 currently


outstanding
 so
 that
 we
 can
 benchmark


that
 against
 credit
 cards?


>> We
 have
 numbers
 that
 are
 reported
 by
 the


companies.
 We
 don't
 have
 data
 that
 is


reported
 by
 a
 government
 source
 like


that.


>> I
 think
 the
 the
 best
 we
 have
 is
 that
 the


transaction
 volume
 is
 around
 116


billion.
 Okay.
 And
 that's
 up
 from
 about


13.8
 billion
 in
 2020.
 So
 this
 is
 is


growing
 pretty
 rapidly.


>> So
 it's
 not
 it's
 a
 nonzero.
 I
 mean
 it's


not
 like
 clearly
 like
 still
 like
 a


fraction
 of
 credit
 cards
 but
 this
 is


beyond
 a
 rounding
 error.


>> That's
 right.


>> Okay.


>> Do
 we
 have
 any
 sense
 of
 how
 usage


patterns
 have
 changed?
 So
 for
 instance,


you
 know,
 during
 the
 pandemic,
 did
 we


see
 an
 uptick
 in
 buy
 now
 pay
 later
 use


as
 people
 were
 struggling
 because
 they


didn't
 have
 jobs
 or
 had
 short-term
 cash


flow
 issues?
 Has
 it
 come
 down
 since


then?


>> We
 are
 seeing
 an
 uptick
 in
 people's
 use


of
 buy
 now
 pay
 later
 and
 we're
 seeing


shifting
 patterns
 of
 what
 they're
 using


it
 to
 purchase.
 So
 I
 think
 I
 said


earlier
 that
 there
 was
 this
 assumption


that
 people
 were
 using
 this
 to
 purchase


clothing
 or
 other
 kind
 of
 luxury
 goods


and
 you
 know
 even
 back
 in
 2022
 when
 the


CFPB
 put
 out
 its
 first
 report
 here
 we


saw
 that
 that
 wasn't
 true.
 People
 were


using
 buy
 now
 pay
 later
 for
 things
 like


groceries
 and
 education
 costs
 the


surveys
 that
 have
 come
 out
 recently


showed
 that
 that's
 growing.
 So
 there
 was


I
 think
 an
 Axio
 survey
 and
 a
 lending


tree
 survey.
 They
 showed
 somewhere


between
 14
 and
 25%
 of
 buy
 now
 payer


users
 are
 using
 it
 to
 purchase


groceries.
 They're
 showing
 that
 a
 bigger


percentage
 of
 people
 are
 using
 bopelator


for
 medical
 and
 dental
 costs
 than
 for


the
 things
 people
 might
 assume


stereotypically
 it's
 used
 for
 like


dining
 out
 or
 ordering
 in
 or
 even
 like


purchasing
 concert
 tickets,
 things
 like


that.


[Music]


Is
 it
 bad?
 I
 mean,
 like,
 you
 know,
 it


seems
 like,
 oh,
 people
 are
 using
 buy
 now


pay
 later
 for
 dental
 or
 they're
 using
 it


for
 groceries
 or
 whatever.
 And
 like
 you


know
 the
 idea
 that
 people
 are
 obviously


stressed
 and
 have
 to
 spread
 out
 or


borrow
 money
 to
 make
 those
 purchases
 is


obviously
 I
 guess
 there
 is
 an
 inherent


angst
 about
 that
 because
 these
 are
 human


essentials.
 But
 is
 it
 really
 per
 se
 bad


or
 is
 it
 just
 like
 no
 this
 is
 like
 yet


another
 tool
 that
 people
 have
 to
 sort
 of


you
 know
 smooth
 consumption
 and
 so


forth.


>> I
 think
 it's
 bad
 that
 we're
 seeing
 an


uptick
 in
 the
 use
 of
 credit
 products
 to


pay
 for
 essentials.
 That's
 not
 to
 say


that
 buy
 now
 pay
 later
 is
 particularly


the
 enemy
 there.
 But,
 you
 know,
 this
 is


part
 of
 the
 reason
 I've
 been
 interested


in
 consumer
 credit
 overall
 is
 that,
 you


know,
 we
 see
 these
 broader
 changes
 go
 on


in
 the
 policy
 space.
 In
 particular,


recently
 we've
 seen
 Donald
 Trump
 and


Republicans
 in
 Congress
 push
 through
 a


bill
 that
 cuts
 Medicaid,
 cuts
 food


assistance,
 you
 know,
 makes
 education


more
 expensive.
 And
 the
 availability
 of


consumer
 credit
 products
 that
 are
 kind


of
 waiting
 in
 the
 wings
 there
 blunts
 our


ability
 to
 really
 understand
 what
 those


changes
 mean.
 So,
 you
 know,
 we
 know
 that


the
 Medicaid
 cuts
 will
 result
 in
 people


having
 more
 expensive
 health
 care,
 but


we
 need
 to
 be
 looking
 at
 the
 fact
 that


that's
 going
 to
 result
 in
 buy
 now
 pay


later
 loans.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 an


opportunity
 for
 medical
 credit
 cards


from
 places
 like
 Synchrony
 with
 Care


Credit.
 And
 so,
 it's
 relevant
 to
 our


overall
 economic
 situation.
 It's


relevant
 to
 the
 kind
 of
 like
 what
 I


think
 of
 as
 like
 a
 silent
 financial


crisis
 that's
 happening
 for
 the
 vast


majority
 of
 families
 in
 the
 United


States,
 but
 it's
 not
 tracked.
 You
 know,


we've
 been
 talking
 about
 buy
 now
 pay


later
 really
 not
 being
 tracked,
 but
 the


overall
 sort
 of
 like
 consumer
 credit


conditions
 for
 families
 are
 really
 not


tracked
 and
 talked
 about
 in
 that
 way.
 We


see
 economists
 going
 on
 TV
 talking
 about


consumption
 and
 CPI
 and
 GDP.
 Yeah.
 Where


families
 are
 kind
 of
 sitting
 around
 the


kitchen
 table
 talking
 about
 CLA
 and
 a


firm
 and
 Sally
 May
 and
 Naviant.
 when
 you


were
 at
 the
 CFPB,
 how
 were
 you
 thinking


about
 buy
 now
 pay
 later
 from
 a
 sort
 of


regulatory
 perspective?


>> Yeah,
 so
 we
 were
 looking
 at
 the
 risks
 of


the
 products
 and
 then
 we
 were
 kind
 of


trying
 to
 look,
 you
 know,
 we've
 had
 this


phenomenon
 with
 consumer
 credit
 products


across
 the
 board,
 not
 just
 specific
 to


buy
 now
 pay
 later,
 but
 it
 was
 really


evident
 at
 CFB
 that
 you
 have
 these
 sort


of
 like
 new
 entrance
 into
 a
 market
 whose


products
 are
 framed
 very
 differently


than
 a
 traditional
 consumer
 credit


product.
 And
 it's
 often
 part
 of
 the


marketing
 pitch.
 It's
 like
 we're
 not


alone.
 We're
 not
 equity.
 We're
 this


totally
 different
 thing.
 And
 it
 pres
 on


consumers
 hesitance
 to
 use
 debt.
 And


then
 also,
 you
 know,
 this
 idea
 that
 we


might
 float
 above
 any
 regulatory
 scheme.


So
 for
 buy
 now
 pay
 later
 and
 for
 these


other
 products
 like
 earned
 wage
 access


or
 income
 share
 agreements,
 you
 know,
 we


were
 looking
 at
 like
 what
 is
 this
 under


the
 law?
 And
 with
 buy
 now
 pay
 later


particularly
 the
 products
 like
 where
 CLA


or
 a
 firm
 is
 offering
 basically
 like
 a


digital
 or
 physical
 card
 where
 you
 can


make
 repeated
 purchases
 where
 you
 have
 a


certain
 sounds
 starts
 to
 sound
 like
 a


credit
 card
 right
 and
 so
 you
 know
 CFB's


initial
 approach
 on
 regulation
 here
 was


to
 really
 just
 say
 like
 you've
 got
 to


follow
 some
 of
 the
 fundamental
 basics


that
 apply
 to
 the
 product
 that
 you
 are


right
 and
 so
 that
 was
 really
 meant
 to


help
 people
 with
 some
 of
 the
 real
 kind


of
 basic
 consumer
 protections
 around


managing
 disputes
 and
 getting
 accurate


billing
 statements.
 The
 other
 thing
 CFPB


was
 doing
 was
 on
 the
 enforcement
 and


supervision
 side.
 So
 really
 taking
 a


look
 at
 these
 companies
 the
 same
 way
 we


do
 any
 other
 financial
 institution
 and


making
 sure
 they're
 following
 the
 law.


And
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 to
 talk
 about


that
 piece
 because
 we've
 seen
 the
 Trump


administration
 pull
 back
 on
 the
 proposed


regulations,
 but
 we've
 also
 seen
 them


pull
 back
 on
 enforcement.
 They


specifically
 said
 they
 would
 depp


prioritize
 buy
 now
 pay
 later
 in


enforcement.
 And
 so
 there
 are
 these


other
 real
 basics
 that
 we're
 seeing
 fall


apart.
 You
 know,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 what


consumers
 are
 complaining
 about
 right


now,
 they're
 saying,
 "I
 had
 autopay
 on


my,
 you
 know,
 my
 CLA
 or
 my
 Afterpay
 and


I
 tried
 to
 take
 it
 off
 and
 the
 company


continues
 to
 charge
 me."
 These
 are
 like


really
 basic
 questions
 of
 whether
 the


companies
 are
 following
 consumer


financial
 laws
 and
 you
 know
 CFPP
 is
 just


off
 the
 job.
 So
 you
 mentioned
 that
 in


the
 research
 prior
 to
 someone
 beginning


to
 use
 BNPL
 there's
 an
 increase
 in
 their


credit
 card
 usage
 right
 why
 does
 someone


flip
 over
 like
 why
 doesn't
 so
 some
 of


these
 purchases
 what
 is
 insufficient


about
 the
 existing
 credit
 card
 system
 is


it
 that
 they're
 hitting
 their
 credit


limits
 or
 what
 is
 the
 situation
 such


that
 then
 BNPL
 becomes
 more
 attractive


>> yeah
 I
 think
 we
 need
 to
 take
 a
 deeper


look
 at
 credit
 utilization
 because
 I
 do


think
 there
 are
 people
 who
 are
 flipping


over
 and
 they're
 using
 their
 available


credit
 balance
 and
 then
 they're
 shifting


to
 buying
 a
 pay
 later.
 But
 I
 think
 there


are
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 people
 who
 are
 just


trying
 to
 juggle
 their
 essentials,
 you


know,
 their
 groceries
 and
 their
 kids


back
 to
 school
 clothes
 and
 they're
 doing


it
 through
 whatever
 feels
 like
 the
 most


convenient
 payment
 method.
 So
 the
 buy


now
 pay
 later
 companies
 have
 made
 a
 real


effort
 at
 being
 that
 convenient
 payment


method,
 both
 through
 kind
 of
 point
 of


sale,
 but
 also
 through
 their
 apps.
 So


they're
 pushing
 their
 users
 towards
 an


app
 that
 both
 makes
 it
 more
 convenient


to
 make
 the
 payment
 but
 also
 pushes
 you


advertisements
 for
 different
 products.


And
 so
 I
 think
 we
 see
 people
 brought
 in


there.
 But
 you
 mentioned
 earlier
 why
 you


don't
 use
 buy
 now
 pay
 later.
 And
 I
 do


think
 it's
 important
 to


>> great
 question.
 We
 could
 do
 a
 half
 hour


on
 on
 um
 your
 personal
 finances.
 I
 think


it's
 important
 to
 know
 that
 even
 while


there's
 a
 big
 percentage
 of
 people
 using


this
 to
 cover
 basics,
 there
 is
 kind
 of
 a


split
 in
 buy
 now
 pay
 later
 where
 if
 you


talk
 to
 consultants
 who
 who
 look
 at
 this


really
 closely,
 they're
 seeing
 people


like
 you
 or
 I
 who
 can
 I'm
 making
 an


assumption
 about
 your
 finances.


>> I
 get
 paid
 well.


>> Okay,
 cool.
 You
 know
 about
 like
 you
 or
 I


who
 can
 make
 a
 purchase
 but
 it's
 a


painful
 purchase.
 You
 know,
 maybe
 it's


like
 a
 new
 television
 or
 something
 that


you
 just
 don't
 want
 to
 pay
 upfront.
 So


there
 there
 are
 people
 using
 it
 in
 that


way
 too.
 Interesting.


>> You
 mentioned
 ease
 of
 use
 and
 I
 think


this
 is
 really
 key.
 What
 are
 the


conversations
 like
 with
 retailers?
 So


like
 what's
 the
 pitch
 that
 buy
 now
 pay


later
 platforms
 are
 going
 to
 make
 to
 I


don't
 know
 a
 Walmart
 or
 whoever
 to
 kind


of
 plug
 directly
 into
 their
 websites.


>> Yeah.
 So
 the
 pitch
 is
 basically
 basket


sizes
 and
 then
 overall
 transaction


volume.
 Right.
 So
 they're
 showing
 that


they're
 getting
 the
 retailers
 about
 10%


more
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 basket
 size.
 So
 the


amount
 of
 things
 that
 people
 are


purchasing
 and
 then
 some
 of
 the


companies
 are
 reporting
 up
 to
 80%
 more


in
 terms
 of
 the
 actual
 transaction.
 So


that's
 pretty
 significant
 for
 retailers


and
 I
 think
 it
 is
 what
 is
 propelling


retailers
 to
 cut
 deals
 with
 CLA
 or


Afterpay
 and
 to
 pay
 the
 costs
 which
 are


higher
 than
 Interchange
 on
 a
 credit


card.
 So
 in
 many
 cases,
 you
 know,
 we're


looking
 at
 costs
 that
 are
 somewhere


between
 1
 to
 8%
 of
 the
 transaction
 plus


like
 a
 flat
 fee
 that
 might
 be
 like
 30


cents
 per
 per
 transaction.
 So
 it's


pretty
 significant.
 I
 think
 the
 other


part
 of
 the
 pitch
 is,
 and
 this
 is
 this


is
 one
 of the
 pieces
 that
 was
 really


kind
 of
 consuming
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 attention


at
 CFB
 is
 the
 ability
 to
 use
 people's


data
 to
 drive
 those
 purchases.
 So,
 I


think
 if
 you're
 a
 merchant
 looking
 at


those
 big
 fees
 if
 you're
 a
 Walmart
 or


Amazon
 or
 whoever,
 you're
 not
 just


saying
 like,
 "Let
 me
 put
 this
 in
 CLA
 or


a
 firm's
 hands
 to
 hope
 that
 people
 use


it
 more,
 but
 let
 me
 use
 the
 data
 I
 have


on
 hand
 to
 try
 to
 drive
 more
 purchases."


And
 like,
 a
 company
 that
 has
 a
 lot
 of


information
 about
 what
 I
 like
 to
 buy
 and


a
 lot
 of
 information
 about
 how
 much


money
 I
 have
 to
 do
 it
 has
 like
 a
 pretty


potent
 set
 of
 data
 to
 help
 drive
 those


purchases.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 part
 of
 the


appeal
 for
 merchants
 as
 well.


>> Do
 we
 have
 a
 way
 of
 essentially


measuring
 from
 the
 consumer's


perspective
 a
 sort
 of
 like
 for-l
 like


interest
 rate
 that
 they
 payment?
 Because


as
 you
 described
 like
 in
 some
 cases


they're
 clear,
 right?
 In
 some
 cases


they're
 more
 embedded
 because
 it's
 free


for
 four
 months
 but
 then
 there's
 like
 a


penalty.
 In
 some
 instances
 it's
 this


thing
 that
 looks
 like
 a
 credit
 card
 but


maybe
 structurally
 there's
 a
 different


way
 of
 getting
 from
 point
 A
 to
 point
 B.


Like
 can
 we
 measure
 like
 okay
 if
 this


were
 a
 credit
 card
 payment
 with
 a
 15%


rate
 this
 is
 the
 apples
 to
 apples


compare
 you're
 paying
 18%
 or
 12%
 like


are
 we
 able
 to
 are
 you
 able
 to
 do
 that?


Me
 personally,
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 able
 to


do
 that.
 But,
 you
 know,
 at
 the
 CFPB,
 we


did
 do
 that
 on
 certain
 products.
 We


didn't
 do
 that
 for
 buy
 now
 pay
 later
 in


many
 cases
 because
 the
 products
 we
 were


studying
 had
 almost
 no
 cost,
 right?
 They


were
 no
 interest
 and
 no
 fee.
 Maybe
 they


had
 a
 late
 fee
 that
 might
 kick
 in.
 But


remember,
 where
 they're
 requiring
 auto


payments,
 which
 most
 of
 the
 companies


are,
 those
 late
 fees
 are
 less
 likely
 to


be
 incurred.
 Sure.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 the


sort
 of
 relevant
 thing
 is
 to
 understand


how
 much
 people
 are
 paying
 overall
 in


excess
 fees
 and
 interest
 for
 the
 goods


and
 services
 that
 they
 need.
 And
 that's


incredibly
 difficult
 to
 do
 because
 these


companies
 are
 sort
 of
 layering
 these


different
 products.
 So
 you
 have
 a
 credit


card
 with
 a
 set
 interest
 rate,
 but
 you


might
 be
 incurring
 debt
 on
 a
 number
 of


different
 products
 across
 multiple
 BNPL


providers
 that
 each
 have
 different
 terms


and
 and
 different
 costs.
 So,
 it's
 really


difficult.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 difficult
 for
 us


to
 understand
 from
 a
 research


perspective.
 It's
 even
 more
 difficult


for
 a
 consumer,
 I
 think,
 to
 make
 those


choices
 and
 those
 trade-offs.


[Music]


Just
 going
 back
 to
 the
 data
 aspect
 of


this
 for
 a
 second.
 You
 said
 that
 some
 of


the
 platforms
 are
 reluctant
 to
 uh
 report


to
 FICO
 and
 are
 asking
 for
 certain


asurances.
 What
 exactly
 do
 they
 want


here?


>> I
 mean,
 I've
 looked
 into
 this
 question.


They
 haven't
 been
 super
 clear,
 I
 think,


about
 what
 they
 want.
 They've
 sort
 of


made
 some
 general
 statements
 that
 they


want
 to
 make
 sure
 that,
 you
 know,


reporting
 this
 data
 won't
 be
 used


negatively
 to
 affect
 people.
 I
 mean
 this


is
 really
 just
 my
 speculation
 but
 what
 I


think
 is
 really
 interesting
 about
 this


is
 the
 companies
 are
 playing
 on
 this


kind
 of
 broader
 skepticism
 about
 credit


reporting
 and
 FICO
 overall
 because
 I


think
 you
 know
 people's
 experience
 and


certainly
 what
 we
 saw
 in
 the
 research
 at


CFB
 is
 that
 you
 know
 credit
 reporting


has
 predominantly
 been
 used
 to
 ding


people
 and
 to
 coers
 them
 into
 making


payments
 they
 might
 not
 want
 to
 make.
 So


like
 medical
 debt
 is
 a
 great
 example
 of


that.
 CFPB's
 research
 showed
 it
 really


had
 no
 value
 for
 the
 fundamental
 purpose


of
 credit
 reporting
 which
 is
 evaluating


people's
 ability
 to
 repay
 um
 and
 it
 was


mostly
 being
 used
 to
 coers.
 So
 when
 CLA


says
 you
 know
 we
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 this


isn't
 used
 to
 ding
 people
 that
 feels


very
 noble
 but
 I
 I
 think
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 we
 should
 be
 kind
 of
 skeptical


of
 why
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 report.


explain
 this
 further
 about
 medical
 debt


and
 when
 you
 say
 it
 has
 no
 value
 but


also
 it's
 being
 used
 of
 course
 what
 are


the
 conditions
 with
 medical
 debt
 and


FICO.


>> Yeah.
 So
 we
 looked
 at
 medical
 debt
 and


credit
 reporting
 really
 closely
 at
 CFPB


and
 what
 we
 saw
 was
 that
 it
 didn't
 have


predictive
 value.
 So
 medical
 debt
 was


not
 predictive
 of
 whether
 you
 would


repay
 other
 types
 of
 debt.
 And
 part
 of


the
 reason
 is
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 medical
 debt


that
 is
 reported
 on
 people's
 credit


reports
 is
 inaccurate
 in
 one
 way
 or


another.
 You
 know,
 it
 might
 be
 that
 the


debt
 collector
 is
 going
 after
 you
 for
 a


debt
 that
 is
 larger
 than
 what
 you
 think


you
 pay
 because
 you
 think
 your
 insurance


company
 ought
 to
 have
 paid.
 It
 might
 be


that
 you
 actually
 already
 paid
 the
 debt


and
 that
 information
 hasn't
 gotten
 to


the
 debt
 collector.
 So,
 it's
 really
 kind


of
 this
 junk
 data
 that's
 sitting
 on


people's
 credit
 reports.
 And


>> and
 then
 explain
 the
 coercion
 element


like
 how
 does
 it
 So
 medical
 debt
 isn't
 a


good
 predictor
 of
 someone's
 ability
 to


pay
 a
 future
 loan,


>> right?


>> So
 it's
 not
 great
 for
 that.
 And
 yet
 what


it's
 still
 like
 people
 because
 it


affects
 their
 credit
 card
 scores
 feel


this
 extra
 pressure
 to
 pay
 it
 off.
 Like


explain
 the
 sort
 of
 like
 the
 effect
 on


the
 end
 the
 end
 patient
 in
 this
 case.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 So
 the
 constituency
 that


wants
 medical
 debt
 on
 your
 credit


reports
 is
 primarily
 third
 party
 debt


collectors.
 And
 why
 do
 they
 want
 that


there?
 they
 want
 it
 there
 so
 that
 they


can
 call
 you
 and
 say,


>> you
 know,
 pay
 this
 debt
 or
 it's
 going
 to


hurt
 your
 credit.
 And
 I
 think
 at
 CFPB,


we
 tried
 to
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 thinking


this
 through
 from
 the
 consumer


perspective
 and
 what
 that
 feels
 like.


>> So,
 actually,
 I
 was
 not
 familiar
 with
 it


all,
 but
 just
 to
 go
 further,
 is
 this


like
 I
 I
 hadn't
 really
 thought
 about
 the


sort
 of
 behindthe-scenes
 fight
 of
 what


does
 and
 doesn't
 go
 into
 a
 FICO,
 but


obviously
 that's
 very
 intuitive.
 Is
 this


like
 a
 common
 thing
 across
 a
 range
 of


either
 formal
 debt
 products
 or
 quas
 debt


products
 where
 they're
 all
 like
 sort
 of


jocking
 either
 to
 be
 in
 or
 out
 of
 the


calculation
 basket?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 think
 it
 is
 the
 medical
 debt


is
 a
 thing
 because
 CFPB
 made
 it
 a
 thing.


I
 don't
 think
 we
 have
 enough
 research
 on


what
 is
 or
 isn't
 on
 your
 credit
 report


and
 why.
 But
 when
 regulators
 start
 to
 to


>> pick
 those
 fights,
 Yeah.
 you
 start
 to


get
 this
 jockeying
 for
 for
 what's
 on


there.
 I
 think
 student
 debt
 is
 another


good
 example
 where
 there
 are
 legitimate


questions
 of
 what
 ought
 to
 and
 not
 not


be
 on
 there.
 And
 some
 of
 it
 is
 about
 the


predictive
 value,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is


about
 putting
 debt
 on
 people's
 credit


reports
 that
 we
 know
 is
 inaccurate.
 It


is
 true
 that
 every
 few
 years
 we
 see
 like


these
 efforts
 from
 private
 companies,
 I


guess,
 to
 try
 to
 augment
 credit
 scores


with
 new
 technology.
 So,
 I
 remember
 very


clearly
 being
 at
 a
 startup's
 offices
 in


San
 Francisco
 in
 like
 I
 guess
 it
 would


have
 been
 2015
 or
 something
 and
 they


were
 walking
 me
 through
 the
 data
 that


they
 could
 use
 to
 make
 short-term
 loans.


And
 one
 of
 the
 things
 they
 were
 talking


about
 was
 like
 just
 the
 basic
 cursor


movement
 on
 the
 screen.
 Like
 how
 fast


you
 click
 the
 button
 to
 get
 money.


Whether
 or
 not
 you
 know
 if
 it's
 a


sliding
 bar
 that
 goes
 from
 like
 $1,000


to
 $10,000.
 Like
 whether
 or
 not
 you


hesitate
 to
 go
 to
 10,000
 and
 then
 go


back
 and
 then
 go
 back
 to
 10,000
 again.


It
 seemed
 very
 dystopian
 to
 me.
 And
 I'm


curious
 what
 those
 efforts
 are
 like


right
 now
 given
 the
 new
 emphasis
 on
 AI


and
 maybe
 you
 know
 even
 more
 data
 that


is
 now
 available
 to
 private
 companies
 to


look
 at
 to
 try
 to
 judge
 whether
 people


are
 creditworthy
 or
 not.


>> Yeah.
 If
 you
 listen
 to
 the
 earnings


calls
 where
 CEOs
 are
 talking
 to


investors
 about
 their
 underwriting


models
 for
 a
 variety
 of
 different


products
 whether
 it's
 kind
 of


traditional
 credit
 cards
 or
 things
 like


BNPL
 AI
 comes
 up
 a
 lot.
 you
 know,


everybody
 sort
 of
 wants
 to
 say
 that


they've
 got
 this
 proprietary
 AI
 model.


>> That's
 exactly
 it.
 Yeah.
 They're
 they


were
 saying
 the
 same
 thing
 10
 years
 ago.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


things
 to
 unpack
 there
 and
 to
 be


concerned
 about.
 So,
 I
 think
 we
 should,


you
 know,
 we
 know
 that
 AI
 models
 often


bake
 in
 racial
 biases.
 So
 we
 know
 that


there's
 some
 concern
 there
 about
 these


models,
 you
 know,
 but
 I
 also
 think
 to


your
 point
 there,
 we're
 dragging
 in
 a


lot
 of
 extraneous
 data
 about
 people
 into


the
 way
 we
 look
 at
 their


creditworthiness.
 Some
 of
 which
 should


be
 relevant,
 some
 of
 which
 really
 should


not.
 And
 what
 I
 think
 is
 most
 important


to
 think
 about
 there
 is
 that
 those


models
 are
 completely
 opaque.
 And


companies
 often
 when
 they're
 faced
 with


regulatory
 scrutiny
 say
 kind
 of
 like
 the


AI
 did
 it,
 right?
 as
 though
 the
 the


people
 at
 the
 companies
 are
 not


responsible
 for
 the
 outcomes
 of
 the


technology.
 So,
 you
 know,
 under
 the


Biden
 administration,
 the
 approach
 there


had
 really
 been
 to
 say,
 you're


responsible.
 This,
 it
 sounds
 so
 basic,


but
 the
 laws
 are
 the
 laws.
 Whether
 it's


about
 consumer
 protection
 or
 about,
 you


know,
 basic
 discrimination
 among
 credit


applicants,
 the
 laws
 are
 the
 laws
 and


you're
 responsible
 for
 the
 outcomes
 of


those
 models.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 shift
 is


or
 that
 kind
 of
 approach
 is
 really


really
 important
 here
 to
 drive
 some


accountability
 because
 otherwise
 it
 does


kind
 of
 get
 out
 of
 hand.


>> So
 I
 mentioned
 in
 the
 intro
 that
 the


parallel
 that
 I
 reach
 for
 when
 thinking


about
 buy
 now
 pay
 later
 is
 sort
 of


private
 credit.
 So
 this
 idea
 that
 you


know
 it's
 a
 more
 opaque
 market
 and


people
 are
 worried
 about
 its
 size
 and


they're
 worried
 about
 transparency
 and


hidden
 leverage
 and
 all
 of
 that.
 But
 on


the
 other
 hand,
 you
 know,
 it
 is
 an
 extra


credit
 spigot
 that
 companies
 can
 tap
 in


times
 of
 emergency
 and
 we
 certainly
 saw


that
 over
 the
 past
 5
 years
 or
 so.
 Net


net,
 when
 you
 look
 at
 buy
 now
 pay
 later,


would
 you
 say
 the
 effects
 are
 good,
 more


good
 or
 more
 bad?
 This
 is
 a
 tough
 one.


>> It
 is
 a
 really
 tough
 one
 because
 I
 don't


I
 said
 this
 earlier.
 I
 I
 don't
 want
 to


single
 out
 buy
 now
 pay
 later
 as
 the
 bad


guy
 here.
 I
 think
 first
 of
 all
 there
 are


a
 lot
 of
 bad
 guys.
 There
 are
 a
 lot
 of


good
 guys
 too.
 But,
 you
 know,
 I
 think


the
 thing
 to
 really
 focus
 on
 is
 like


we're
 in
 what
 the
 Trump
 administration


is
 describing
 as
 like
 a
 relatively
 good


economy
 and
 we're
 sitting
 here
 talking


about
 like
 turning
 on
 the
 spigot
 for


these
 kind
 of
 like
 new
 and
 interesting


types
 of
 debt
 to
 help
 people
 handle


really
 basic
 expenses.


>> That
 seems
 like
 a
 problem.
 We
 should
 not


be
 in
 an
 emergency
 situation
 and
 yet
 we


are.
 And
 so
 I'm
 concerned
 that
 that


availability
 of
 these
 credit
 products
 is


obscuring
 like
 the
 kind
 of
 growing


emergency
 around
 people's
 cost
 of
 living


which
 often
 you
 know
 in
 the
 news
 is


about
 their
 grocery
 prices,
 the
 eggs,


their
 sneakers
 for
 back
 to
 school
 and


those
 are
 really
 important
 but
 it's
 also


their
 health
 care,
 the
 cost
 of
 college,


being
 able
 to
 retire.
 So
 families
 are


feeling
 really
 squeezed
 and
 you
 know
 to


me
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 there
 is


like
 we're
 I
 think
 we're
 seeing
 the


Trump
 administration
 sort
 of
 test
 out


this
 theory
 that
 they
 can
 keep
 the


highlevel
 metrics
 of
 whether
 the
 economy


is
 on
 track
 steady
 or
 growing
 while


letting
 somewhere
 around
 60%
 of
 people


have
 these
 private
 financial
 crises.


We're
 going
 to
 see
 that
 play
 out
 over


the
 next
 couple
 of
 years.
 And
 so
 that's


that's
 the
 way
 I
 think
 about
 these


credit
 products.
 It's
 not
 really
 like
 is


the
 individual
 one
 good,
 but
 it's
 like


do
 we
 know
 what
 we're
 doing
 overall
 and


is
 anyone
 doing
 the
 math?


>> All
 right,
 Julie
 Morgan,
 thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 coming
 on
 ALA.
 It's
 really


appreciated.


>> Thank
 you.
 Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


[Music]


>> Joe,
 I'm
 glad
 we
 finally
 did
 that


episode.
 We've
 been
 talking
 about
 doing


one
 on
 BNPL
 for
 a
 while.
 BNPL
 it
 always


reminds
 me
 of
 like
 it
 sounds
 like
 BMP


Paraba's
 like
 Italian
 subsidiary
 or


something,
 but
 there
 are
 a
 bunch
 of


things
 to
 pick
 out
 there.
 I
 mean,
 number


one,


>> it's
 clearly
 a
 nuanced
 issue,
 right?
 And


like
 clearly,
 as
 you
 laid
 out
 in
 the


intro,
 it
 can
 have
 a
 smoothing
 effect.


>> Yeah.


>> The
 second
 thing
 that
 always
 seems
 to


come
 up
 is
 this
 idea
 that
 like
 well


>> it's
 not
 that
 big
 now,
 right?
 like
 it's


not
 big
 enough
 to
 have
 an
 effect
 right


now.


>> But
 as
 Julie
 mentioned,
 we
 are
 seeing,


you
 know,
 volumes
 slowly
 pick
 up
 and
 I


guess


>> not
 that
 slowly.


>> Not
 that
 slow.
 Yeah,
 you're
 right.
 And
 I


guess
 like
 I
 kind
 of
 wonder
 what
 happens


like
 as
 more
 and
 more
 of
 this
 activity


actually
 stretches
 into
 services
 versus


goods.
 Like
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 quite
 a
 big


shift.
 Well,
 I'd
 say
 like
 I
 I
 think
 uh


Julie's
 last
 point
 was
 very
 relevant,


which
 is
 like,
 you
 know,
 when
 we
 think


about
 household
 borrowing
 and
 again


probably
 you
 and
 I
 because
 we're
 sort
 of


children
 of
 uh
 or
 you
 know,
 grew
 up


during
 the
 financial
 crisis,
 you
 know,


we
 sort
 of
 think
 about
 like


>> we
 weren't
 children.


>> No,
 we
 were
 children,
 but
 you
 know
 what


I'm
 saying?
 You
 know,
 I
 think
 you
 and
 I


often
 think
 about
 credit
 from
 the


effects
 of
 defaults
 and
 so
 forth.
 And


that
 could
 be
 an
 effect
 and
 that's
 not


something
 to
 be
 dismissed.
 But
 the
 other


idea
 is
 like
 how
 much
 of
 like
 sort
 of


like
 aggregate
 economic
 conditions


consumption
 is
 sort
 of
 debt
 financed
 and


in
 a
 way
 that
 we
 can't
 like
 fully


measure,
 right?
 Because
 we
 comfortably


can
 measure
 credit
 card
 debt
 and
 so
 we


have
 some
 sense
 of
 credit
 card
 debt
 is


the
 size
 of
 incomes
 or
 whatever.
 But
 if


there's
 this
 other
 rapidly
 growing


source
 and
 it's
 pretty
 crucial
 for
 like


sort
 of
 keeping
 the
 headline
 figures
 of


consumption
 or
 GDP,
 you
 know,
 like
 my


conclusion
 or
 like
 my
 sense
 is
 like


yeah,
 it's
 not
 that
 huge
 yet,
 but
 it's


definitely
 not
 nothing
 and
 it's


definitely
 not,
 you
 know,
 it's
 bigger


than
 a
 rounding
 error,


>> right?
 And
 it
 certainly
 says
 something


to
 Julia's
 point
 about
 like
 the
 state
 of


the
 average
 American
 consumer
 who


probably
 is
 struggling
 to
 pay
 something


like
 dental
 fees.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 No.
 And
 like
 the
 fact
 and


like
 um
 you
 know
 I
 think
 there's
 I


thought
 it
 was
 interesting
 too
 that
 like


maybe
 both
 of
 us
 or
 at least
 just
 me
 had


a
 certain
 maybe
 already
 outdated
 view
 of


what
 BNPL
 is.
 Oh
 yeah
 because
 like
 the


idea
 of
 like
 oh
 I'm
 going
 to
 buy


>> I
 didn't
 realize
 that
 they
 had
 like


actual
 apps.


>> Yeah.
 So
 the
 idea
 that
 like
 oh
 I'm
 going


to
 buy
 a
 television
 that's
 $1,000
 and


make
 it
 like
 four
 $250


purchases.
 Like
 that
 sounds
 great.
 I


should
 I
 should
 be
 doing
 this.
 But
 if


that's
 just
 sort
 of
 like
 one
 business


model,
 but
 that
 there's
 like
 this


growing
 business
 model
 that
 looks
 more


like
 installment
 loans
 where
 there
 is
 a


formal
 interest
 rate,
 but
 it
 also
 sort


of
 looks
 like
 the
 same
 thing
 and
 you


also
 get
 a
 card,
 etc.,
 but
 it's
 just


like
 a
 slightly
 different
 structure
 and


formally
 it
 isn't
 called
 debt
 or
 isn't


categorized
 or
 isn't
 reported
 as
 debt,


then
 I
 then
 I
 think
 obviously
 we
 need
 to


continue
 to
 get
 a
 better
 handle
 on,
 you


know,
 how
 big
 this
 is.


>> Yeah,
 absolutely.
 Also,
 Clara
 says
 it's


a
 bank
 now,
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 confusing.


Yeah.
 Um,


>> everyone,


>> it's
 like
 the
 hottest
 thing
 everyone


wants.
 Everyone's
 always
 filing
 for
 bank


charters
 these
 days.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 That
 would
 be
 interesting
 to


look
 at
 because
 we
 went
 after
 the


financial
 crisis.
 Speaking
 of
 2008,
 we


went
 years
 and
 years
 and
 years
 a


like
 every
 random
 brokerage
 or
 fintech.


Oh,
 we
 got
 a
 bank
 charter.
 We
 acquired
 a


company
 that
 has
 a
 bank
 charter.


>> Time
 is
 a
 flat
 circle,
 Joe.
 Yeah.


>> All right.

 we
 leave
 it
