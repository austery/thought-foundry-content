Dennis Molinaro is a former
national security analyst and
policy adviser for the Canadian
federal government, and the
author of Under Assault
Interference in Espionage in
China's Secret War Against
Canada.
And he joins us in studio.
How are you doing, sir?
>> Very well.
How are you?
>> I'm doing great.
Let's start with a little
history lesson here.
You say in your book that
China's covert actions against
Canada go back over 50 years to
Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.
What's the story there?
>> Oh, there's a story.
Yeah.
So it goes back really to the
time when the PRC, the People's
Republic of China, was looking
to get recognised by the world
and the Communist Party wanted
their government recognised as
the sole government in charge of
China.
And so what I learned from
declassified documents was
essentially one of the principal
actors of that era.
An individual named Paul Lin was
very influential in speaking out
in terms of recognition of China
that it needed to happen, trying
to meet with government members
of government, academics,
policymakers of all kinds
internationally.
And it turns out through the
records that he was actually an
agent of influence, as the RCMP
put it, for China.
And that really started to
change the story of when did
interference and influence
start?
I mean, because it started to
look like it was a lot earlier
than we may have thought.
>> When we talk about
interference, I want to make
sure we distinguish.
How do we distinguish between
foreign interference versus,
say, lobbying.
>> The covert aspect is the main
element, right?
So when when something is covert
and being done behind closed
doors, that's when it changes
from something that is really
open and legitimate type of
lobbying work.
When it shifts into the covert
space, it becomes generally
could be more nefarious.
And so that's really what we're
looking at is nefarious activity
that is at the behest of a
foreign state.
>> Give me an example.
>> Sure.
So, well, you could think about
trying to influence a community
leader to not speak out against
China in some way if we're
talking about China, which we
are today.
So trying to influence community
members not to.
So somebody could be covertly
doing that for the PRC, for
China, within Canada, not
declaring that activity so
secretly working for the state
and harassing dissidents or
harassing people could be
influencing politicians to take
a certain policy line, could be
stealing intellectual property
by getting into partnerships.
>> Dennis, most viewers and
listeners may be familiar with
the allegations around election
interference, but what other
areas has China targeted?
>> So as I mentioned, a little
bit of other areas like research
partnerships.
So it would be trying to partner
with a Chinese institution or
company, maybe that's got a
state linked influence, trying
to partner with academics,
trying to form partnership
agreements for research and for
funding.
And behind the scenes, there are
clauses to turn over
intellectual property.
So that's that's another way of
trying to influence and trying
to gain tactical advantage for
China.
>> When we talk about trade and
interference, what does that
look like?
>> Trade is is another one that
has a long history in terms of
the PRC looking to build trade
linkages, which would give them
access to different
technologies.
Again, intellectual property
over time, but also in this
case, if we're talking about
trade in the present modern day
era, then we're talking about
potentially PRC EVs, right?
So the risks here start to
become one.
Chinese goods and technologies
that are strategic, entering
into the supply chain of North
America, that becomes a problem,
particularly with our
relationship with the United
States.
And the integrated auto sector,
you're also getting companies
that are traditionally heavily
state subsidised.
So that undercuts Canadian
labour and manufacturers.
You're also getting other
avenues that don't get talked
about a lot.
And that's because in China, a
number of companies have been
pulled into what's called
military civil fusion.
This is where companies are
directly contributing or
indirectly contributing to
China's military ambitions.
Okay.
And so the danger there is, if
we get tied into a company that
provides technology to us or
cars or what have you, that
might have a military civil
fusion connection.
So then we would be indirectly
assisting the PLA, the People's
Liberation Army.
Okay.
>> I can see the concerns there.
>> There's concerns.
>> You are throughout this book
sort of waving, you know,
pressing the alarm and letting
people in on sort of what many
people don't know.
But the Canadian Security
Intelligence Service, CSIS has
listed a number of other
countries, India, Russia, Iran
as potential sources of
interference.
So one has to ask the question,
why is there so much focus on
China?
>> Well, because I felt that
this history had not been told.
Typically what we we have in
Canada, what's happened is
successively over the years and
continually is as I make the
point in the book, there have
been there has been a belief
when it comes to China that
Canadian policymakers have
continued, and even business
leaders have continued to view
China as they want to see it,
rather than as it actually is.
And so you can't really have
that diplomatic history or that
diplomatic understanding of the
country when it's when all the
intelligence security aspect is
ignored.
So China becomes the main focus
because of the fact that it is a
rising superpower.
And it's our second largest
trading partner.
And progressively, consistently,
actually, over the years,
Canadian intelligence has
identified it as the number one
threat.
So it made logical sense that we
needed this story told.
>> Now, I do have to ask, when
you were a national security
analyst, were you able to
communicate any of these
concerns?
>> I couldn't say.
>> Signed an NDA.
>> Yeah.
That's that's an oath you carry.
Whatever I did or didn't do, I
could never talk about it.
>> Fair enough.
All right.
Given understanding that given
the seriousness of the issue,
though you've outlined in your
book, how has it been handled by
successive governments?
We're to kind of look at the
history here and with our
current government.
But what have we seen?
>> So what I saw from the book
were researched for the book was
that continually, you never
really saw governments
addressing any of the activities
that were going on domestically.
And that dates all the way back
to the Trudeau senior years.
You would have instances appear
in the newspaper.
You would have warnings appear
from the security services.
So in one instance, actually in
the after the after China gets
an embassy here, you have the
CBC reporting that the FBI was
concerned and wanted to arrest
of diplomats who were bringing
intelligence using the the
embassy in Canada to funnel
intelligence back to China that
they were collecting in the
United States.
>> Okay.
>> And nothing appeared to have
happened with that at all that I
could find.
You had other instances where
technology is sold to China.
There were efforts to try to
sell.
There was an effort actually,
where they did sell.
Companies did sell the engines
for China's first attack
helicopters.
Tried to do it again later.
You had one instance in the
press where Canada was was fine
with selling China spy planes
that would be equipped with
technology from Israel.
When that got exposed in the
press, the deal seemingly fell
apart as far as I could find.
But we have all these warnings
about the PRC's activities
against and transnational
organised organised crime, but
also transnational crime or
repression against dissidents.
Haven't seen anything happen.
>> Is it different now than in
those cases?
>> I think the danger that we're
into now is that because of how
long some of these activities
have continued, we've had
warnings from from the Chinese
Canadian community and different
diaspora communities that
they've been targeted by China,
for instance, just using this as
an example going back to the
'80s and '90s.
Okay.
And so the difference now is
when we know the activity has
been going on that long, it
emboldens people who are doing
the activity.
If there's no cost imposed, then
there's no reason for them to
stop.
>> How?
I don't want us to to sort of
look into to the future, but how
bad can this be?
>> It can be very bad.
I mean, potentially when you're
talking about a a state that is,
you know, challenging the United
States, which is still our
traditional ally in spite of the
problems we've been having, is
is considered, I would say, an
adversary to, to Canada, really
in these activities that it's
doing, it's bullying its
neighbours.
And if it's able to try to
influence Canadians, if it's if
it's able to harass Canadians on
Canadian soil, that undermines
our sovereignty, that undermines
our democracy and our democratic
institutions.
And that, for me, is very
troubling.
If we can't offer protections to
our people that are living here.
>> You wrote a recent column for
the National Post titled
Diversifying Trade with With
China.
It's a losing play.
Why do you think so?
>> Because, again, for a lot of
the reasons that I just
mentioned, you're you're dealing
with a quote unquote partner
that is been historically proven
unreliable.
And we're not talking about one
administration like we've been
having with problems with the
United States.
I'm talking about.
And in that article, in that op
ed, I continually point out,
just briefly, the history of
where China repeatedly
weaponized trade against us.
Canola.
Yes, canola.
Going back to 2008.
Would find reasons to block its
shipment.
Would find reasons to change
docking, storage fees and what
have you and all kinds of
matters related to it.
And would sometimes just
outright not accept it.
And they did this to leverage us
to try to to exert pressure on
us to conform to a policy that
they wanted.
>> Canada agreeing to reducing
tariffs and allowing Chinese EVs
into the country.
I can get the sense from our
from what you said earlier.
Not a good idea.
But when we talk about trade and
sort of when we talk about our
neighbours to the South, we and
you mentioned China being the
second biggest trading partner.
Does that not make sense to be
going in that direction?
>> Not on strategic materials.
And I would put EV in the
category of strategic because of
the technologies that are
involved in an EV, because of
the fact that we won't be able
to control where the data that
EVs collect go, because we don't
have insights on what companies
relationships will be in China
with the PRC military.
For all those reasons, it makes
it unless we can be given
subtype of assurances or
guardrails, that we won't have
to worry about those things.
>> But we should note that a
number of countries do have
Chinese EVs and may not use them
in government.
In military.
>> So.
Right.
I mean, we've had instances
where they've been restricted
from being driven to certain
locations.
Advice given where you don't
connect your cell phone to it.
So you start to ask, why are you
buying a car like that?
If you have those kinds of
problems, but those other
instances as well, don't rely on
having such an integrated North
American auto market either.
Okay.
And we have auto production here
too.
That is going to get undercut by
that, that trade.
But it's not to say we shouldn't
trade with China.
We absolutely should.
And it's totally fine to
diversify trade with China.
It's when we get into the realms
of strategic technology and
goods, and we have to go in
understanding the relationship
some companies might have with
the state and the military, and
also addressing the activity
they've been doing here.
You do all that, then it's
possible.
>> All right.
In a recent post on X, you wrote
about why the US doing business
with China is different than
Canada doing business with
China.
Yeah.
Lay down the argument.
>> For sure.
Different in the sense of the
US.
One is the world's largest
economy.
So when China tries to pressure
them in a particular industry or
tries to hurt them or retaliate,
in a way the United States
economy is large enough that it
can absorb it.
Simply put, it can absorb it,
and it can retaliate harder.
Okay.
That we don't have that option.
You look at the canola EV
incident.
We, in my opinion, completely
buckled and caved on canola in
exchange for dropping the tariff
on EVs.
What was our ability to
retaliate to China that would
have made a difference?
It didn't seem like there was
one.
And along with that, the US has
more safeguards in terms of
export controls, entity lists,
banning of certain Chinese
companies if they have military
partnerships.
They have a foreign agent
registry that they've had since
the '30s that they use to go
after people that are actually
working secretly on behalf of
the PRC state.
We don't have any of those
things.
>> All right.
Whether we like it or not, it
does seem like Canada and China
will have relations, as you
mentioned.
Of course, in your book, you
offer a set of recommendations
on what Canada can do to to kerb
China's interference.
Let us hear some of them.
>> So one, I think a number of
recommendations that the inquiry
made when it comes to election
financing, those should those
are easy implementations.
Those should right away I think
could easily be implemented.
I would say standardising across
the board when it comes to
elections in terms of not just
elections federally, but on the
municipal and provincial level
and in nomination contests, the
rules should be the same.
You should be.
I don't see why you can't have
people that are 18 and a citizen
voting in a nomination contest.
Why we need to have the age
lowered to something like 14 and
not even being.
That doesn't make sense to me.
It's it's an election.
So those I think are easy fixes
that should be made.
But other things like the
foreign agent registry, we need
that to come in and we need that
to have some teeth so that it
doesn't just function as a way
to manage influence.
In other words, have a nefarious
activity that we become okay
with as long as we can kind of
organise and manage it, one that
actually is used to deter it,
and there's some type of cost
imposed for that kind of
activity.
So those are, I think, realistic
fixes, that some of these things
are already in play.
I think they just need to be
followed through.
>> All right Dennis, we're going
to leave it there.
Really appreciate your insights.
Thank you so much for this.
>> Thank you very much for
having me I appreciate it.
