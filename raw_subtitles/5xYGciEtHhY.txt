>> If you don't have an iPhone,
there's a good chance you know
someone who does.
Lots of people probably.
It's estimated there are
more than 1.5 billion
iPhones active worldwide.
So how did Apple become
one of the major players in
the smartphone
market?
Well, after facing challenges
building them on three
continents, it turned its
focus to China and ended up
developing one of the most
sophisticated supply chains
in the world.
In doing so, it also helped
China strengthen its
domestic electronics industry
with major consequences.
So what does a stronger China
mean for global trade?
The tech, race, and
national security.
And how do actions half a world
away affect us here at home?
Then Ontario may not be able to
compete industrially with a
giant like China.
But what about medium and
small markets?
Could solid industrial policy
put us on the same playing
field as, say, Nordic countries
or South Korea?
And for that matter, what is
industrial policy anyways?
Welcome to "The Rundown."
China is helping fuel Apple's
success and the company's
success has had major benefits
for China.
Here's part of my conversation
with business journalist
Patrick Magee.
We talked about his new book,
Apple in China: The
Capture of the World's Greatest
Company, and how the tech
giant's dependence on China
is affecting all of us.
Patrick, glad to have you here.
>> Thank you.
My pleasure, Jeyan.
>> Now, to me, and I think for
a lot of people who are reading
this book, this was the moment
sort of the gruelling design
process, the, the ID, the MD,
the, the PD.
They're not doctorates.
This is sort of the maybe
break that down for us.
What are those?
You kind of build it
as a pyramid.
>> Yeah.
There's a pyramid structure
within Apple.
So think of any product.
The first team to sort of
conceive of a product,
what it's going to look like,
what it's going to feel like
is industrial design.
So famously in the golden age
that's led by Jony Ive, that's
the team that will say the iPod
is going to be, you know,
unapologetically white with a
chrome back.
Right?
They sort of throw it over the
fence to product design or PD.
You could think of this
as a brilliant team of engineers
that's trying to figure out,
how do we make one of these
work, where's the
circuit board going to be?
Where's the battery going to be?
What else does it need?
Then they throw it over
to this team that had never
really been written about
before, called MD
or Manufacturing Design.
Their idea is basically like,
how do we actually
build this thing?
Who are our suppliers?
Who are our contract
manufacturers?
And it's basically them
that decide to go to Asia,
really following the sort of
flow of the entire computer
industry and then from
within Asia over the years,
you end up going to China.
So there's this like seven year
like long march to China.
I talk about from 1996 to 2003.
And as Apple's coming up with
these brilliant designs,
the thing that we've sort of
forgotten about Apple is that
if things are designed in a
totally conceptually different
way and for different aesthetic
and so forth, they're built in
a different way to meet those
standards.
And the building of those
things requires training.
If you're assembling Dell
computers, you don't have the
training, the plastic injection
moulding skills, the the metal
stamping skills to create a
translucent plastic computer.
And so MD sends people over to
Asia, literally by the
planeload to train up people to
meet Apple's demanding
qualities.
And much later, when
the iPhone becomes a big
success, you're meeting their
quality levels at astounding
quantities as well.
And when you combine
Apple's like zero tolerance
for defects culture
with the mind boggling
quantities that begin with
the iPod mini and then extend
through to the iPhone,
you begin to understand that
the sort of meet cute moment
before Apple and China get
married ends up having these
second order, third order
impacts where Apple ends up
being like a nation builder
in China.
>> All right.
I want to actually take it back
a little bit, because I know
there's some great characters
in there.
And I want to talk about Terry
because there's a phone call
that he makes that he
essentially says he sees what,
you know, Steve Jobs sees
and says, I can fix this
essentially, and kind of help
us understand, because before
China, like you mentioned,
there were other nations that
were, you know, used in sort of
the MD process, the
manufacturing process.
Why did Apple finally decide
to move production to China?
If you look at Terry,
I see him as a similar mind
as Steve Jobs.
Yeah, it was kind of a perfect
marriage in some way.
>> So one of the best lines of
the book was written by my wife.
And the line is something like
the meeting of the minds
between Jony Ive and Steve Jobs
made Apple products unique, but
it was Tim Cook and Terry Guo
who would make them ubiquitous.
And so Terry Guo is the founder
of Foxconn 1974, founded in a
place in Taiwan that translates
to dirt city in English.
So Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak
are in a garage.
Terry goes in a shed
in Dirt city.
So what's interesting is that
he's Taiwanese, and Taiwan
and China are at odds
for decades until I believe
it's 1987, where there's like
a rapprochement and
Taiwanese businessmen are
allowed to go to China for the
first time and set up shop.
And it ends up being this hugely
consequential advent for China,
because they don't have any
manufacturing expertise at the
time.
I mean, Mao has left the
country in tatters.
And so the thinking of
Deng Xiaoping with reform
and opening up is how about
we lure in capital from
Hong Kong, from Taiwan,
from Japan.
So we sort of make it easy
in these zones, like in
Shenzhen, for things to be
built here.
And then we'll sort of
learn the skill sets and so
forth to, to sort of give, you
know, jobs and value and skill
sets to our own people.
And that just works like
nothing's worked in history
in a certain sense.
Right?
I mean, you've had for decades
a sense of double digit growth
in China, and the Taiwanese
end up being totally
instrumental to the
high-end electronics world.
And so Terry, the founder of
Foxconn, just has a different
strategy.
He's more ambitious,
and he latches on to the
uniqueness of Apple, really
just better than anybody.
I think he understands Apple
before.
Apple understands Apple.
>> Well, there's a scene in
this book where Terry looks
around the field and he's with
some Apple execs, and he says
he's going to get a factory
built here.
But the Apple execs
see what an empty field.
>> Yeah, this.
>> Is John Rubenstein.
So he's the podfather, right?
Senior vice president at
the time of hardware,
Jony Ive's boss.
I mean, as high as you can go.
He worked with Apple Steve Jobs
for 16 years.
Yeah.
So yeah, so Terry points out
to an empty field basically
full of garbage and says,
here's your factory.
And this is, I think, in like
an April, and the iPod is
supposed to be being built for
the Christmas season.
Pressure's on.
He's panicking.
I mean, he's literally having
like an anxiety attack.
But Terry basically understood
probably more than anybody else
in China, just what China's
speed meant and how quickly
they could come up with a
factory.
>> Well, I'm curious, how does
the ability to just build a
factory play into a country's
sort of comparative advantage?
>> Well, so what's interesting
is that I don't know that we
would talk about China at this
stage, because it really is
just Shenzhen.
And Shenzhen is sort of
carved out from the rest
of the country in terms of
having like a total sort of
laissez faire experimentation
with capitalism sort of
approach.
And so they're just able to
build buildings at an
astonishing rate.
I mean, so the unofficial
mantra during that time
was every every three days,
a new floor.
And so when you were building
factories, that's how quickly
you were doing things.
I don't know what the standard
is in Canada, but, you know,
it's going to be.
>> A.
>> Lot slower.
Right?
And so the joke that
John Rubinstein makes
really not a joke.
I mean, just the reality is
that they would build
a factory at a time
when you and I would still be
doing the environmental
paperwork.
It's tough to compete with that.
And China was doing that
over and over and over.
At least Shenzhen was.
>> Well, that's my follow up.
How do countries like ours,
Canada here, compete with China?
>> Honestly, I don't think we
can you know, there's there's
there's I guess the basic
economic understanding right
would be comparative advantage.
What skills do we have.
What assets do we have
that we should exploit.
Because going after what China
is able to excel at
but without the same workforce,
without the same population,
like we're just going to be
failing from the get go.
So there are things of course,
Canada can do.
And we're pretty we're pretty
stellar economy.
But competing against
the Chinese in high end
electronics manufacturing,
that would just be an invitation
to failure.
>> I want people to get a
better understanding of just
the sheer magnitude of what one
of these factories could do.
How big are we talking?
How many workers?
What's the output here?
>> The numbers are staggering,
but it's not even the size of
one factory.
It's it's the fact
that what China offers is is
next door manufacturing.
Where around the assembly site.
You have all these other places
doing the plastic injection
moulding and the metal stamping
and and so many other things.
And so, you know, some of my
early chapters are about what
it means to manufacture in
Taiwan, where you have the
expertise, but it's just an
island of 20 million people.
And so they have to rely on
Thailand, Singapore, Japan and
all these other areas.
And so what China is able to
offer is, is an ability where
people are just going from
one factory to another,
maybe ten minutes away,
rather than flying over
an ocean.
And that's what's so difficult
to compete with.
But an individual factory
today, if we're fast forwarding,
like Zhengzhou, is a place
in China that does about
half of all iPhone production,
they've got 400,000 people
working there at peak season.
I mean, that's just an
incredible amount.
And sometimes people think,
well, isn't Apple making major
investments in Vietnam or India
and so forth.
And I've got these slides
internal to Apple that are
a little bit dated.
I think they're late 2010s,
but it talks about there being
91,000 employees in 70 factories
in five non-Chinese countries.
And so you think 70 factories
equating to 90,000 workers
compares with one factory
in China that has
400,000, right?
A company like Biel Crystal,
which does some of the
the glass on the front
of the phone, that factory
alone has 72,000 workers.
So China is just operating on
a scale that is hard to even
comprehend, let alone compete
with.
>> They're playing a different
game.
>> Yeah.
They have this, like
Nietzschean will to power
through manufacturing.
>> Thank you so much.
>> Thank you, Jeyan.
>> What do you think of when I
say the words industrial policy?
Kind of sounds like jargon,
right?
But it's actually way more
than that.
Industrial policy is basically
a guide designed by government
to help shape the economy
so it works better.
It's about encouraging
innovation, boosting
productivity, and helping
the country or province grow.
It used to relate mostly to
manufacturing, but people talk
about it now in terms of all
kinds of sectors.
We know the province is
focusing on automotive, EVs,
AI and more.
But could an industrial policy
help us become more globally
competitive and could
innovation drive it?
I asked David Wolfe,
professor emeritus
of political science at the
University of Toronto and
co-director of the Innovation
Policy Lab at the Munk School
of Public Policy and Stephany
Lapierre, founder of and chief
brand officer at Tealbook, a
supply chain software start-up.
David.
Stephanie, welcome to
The Rundown.
How are you guys doing?
>> Extremely well.
Yeah.
Good.
Thanks for having us.
>> All right, David, now that
we understand what industrial
policy is, why is industrial
policy important?
>> We're living in a different
era than we did in the 20th
century.
Even the beginning of
the 21st.
And more and more countries
are moving up the scale
in terms of the complexity
of the products they produce,
the export markets they're
penetrating into.
And many of these countries have
used industrial policy to get
to where they are today.
If we want to keep up
or stay ahead, we need to use
the same policy tools.
>> Can you grade Canada in
terms of its industrial policy?
When we take a bigger picture.
>> Canada doesn't have an
industrial policy, neither does
Ontario, so it would be very
hard to grade them.
Ontario Ontario created
an industrial policy framework
in 1992 that I was involved
with to the best.
It lasted 3 or 4 years and the
next government got rid of it,
and that's the last time we've
tried to do anything on that
kind of scale.
>> All right.
We'll get back to that.
Stephanie, you are the
founder and chief brand officer
of Tealbook.
What does your company do?
>> So I'm trying to simplify
this.
>> For the non-tech people.
>> Yeah, yeah.
So we're a data company.
So we focus on data.
And we were one of the first
companies in Toronto to use AI
to collect data on businesses.
So what it means is if a
company, an enterprise has buy
goods and services, they're
buying from companies, and
there's a lot of information to
collect from those companies to
manage finance and supply chain
and procurement and risk.
But right now, they're usually
asking those providers to put
information into portals.
And so our technology collects
all the information.
We've created a very high
quality and credible
foundation of 230 million
verifiable businesses.
And we're connected to
countries registries.
So it's like if you're a
business and you register
with a government and get
a tax ID number, we connect it
to that.
And that allows our customers
to have a really good picture
and all the information
they need to do business
with suppliers to manage risk
or optimise what they're
spending money on, or decide
if they're going to buy
more locally or, you know,
trying to bring new suppliers
from, you know, external.
>> So procurement is the big
sort of.
>> So we've been focussed on
procurement but data touches
finance.
It touches like if you're in
risk and compliance
in a company, you need to
understand your supplier base
so that you can monitor risk
much better.
You can also ensure that
you're reviewing those
suppliers on a consistent
basis.
So data is really important.
And finance you're
paying suppliers.
So it's really important
you're paying the right
suppliers and you're
not paying them twice.
And supply chain you need to
understand the risk and the
potential disruption to your
business.
So there's a lot of reasons
why everyone in the company
that touches third
party providers would need data.
>> I imagine I'm hearing money
here because I'm thinking for a
lot of these companies,
efficiency is important when
you're thinking of the company
itself.
But the manufacturers
tell me a little bit about sort
of the importance of being an
efficient company.
>> Yeah.
I mean, if you think
just of the problem that we
solve, we typically say that a
company that has 6000 suppliers,
which for us it would be a
small customer and $1 billion
in spend, which again, would be
a small customer would be
probably wasting about 8 to $10
million a year just managing
data because everyone's doing
their own thing with the with
the same suppliers and asking
the same suppliers to come into
different places, different
doors in the company.
And so that's just wasting
a lot of time.
And then there's no collective
brain on who do we
do business and where is this
data stored that everyone can
access.
And so there's really
limited visibility into like
how do you optimise an enormous
amount of dollars going through
the company to, you know,
improve your margins or drive
more competitiveness from your
supply base?
>> Okay, David, we've come a
long way with technology,
as we can hear just from from
Tealbook example there.
What effect has the adoption
of technology and AI
had on industrial policy?
>> It can be the object of
industrial policy.
The thing to remember about
information technology over
the last 20 to 30 years,
and now AI, is that it's
transforming virtually
virtually every industry, every
sector of the economy.
There's no sector,
as Stephanie's example makes
really clear,
there's no sector of the
economy that's not touched by
what technology can do.
And now what AI is doing.
We haven't had we've had
policies to support research
on AI.
We've had policies to support
training students to, you know,
learn AI, to program an AI.
But we haven't had an effective
policy to diffuse AI out into
the broader economy.
We haven't had that at
the federal level.
We haven't had it at the
provincial level.
The feds are currently
touting their $2 billion
spend to buy more compute power
for companies to use AI.
Individual US companies
are spending open AI and Nvidia.
These companies are spending
$50 billion a year on on their
compute power.
What we have from the
governments is minuscule.
>> Stephanie.
On that note, the
Ontario government has made
investments in AI
and innovation.
In your view, is there enough
support to ensure industries
like yours can remain
competitive?
>> I'm going to be trying to be
political, so we were involved
in some of the programs that
the government had put in place
around.
AI was a big investment
with millions and millions of
dollars.
We didn't benefit from it.
The the complexity of
navigating the program was so
challenging.
And, and, and there was no
real commercial value.
So as a start-up company,
you know what?
You have time.
You don't have a lot of time
and money runs out.
And so you need to focus
your effort on winning
customers.
And when you add all this
layers of complexity and
who owns the IP and how can
you commercialise the asset
and that's unsure then then
it's losing its purpose
and it doesn't benefit.
Start-up companies like ours.
We've benefited from programs
like shred that gives us tax
benefit from investing in
technology, but it's not
necessarily specific to AI.
And although we are an AI
company based in Toronto,
it's been very difficult
to get funding
and unnecessarily difficult,
I would say, even though
there are programs.
>> What about the private
sector in terms of funding?
>> Yeah, I mean, we're private
company from the government.
I mean, we win customers, right?
And they give us revenue,
and that's how we get.
>> The funding.
Private investors.
>> For VCs, right?
We've we've raised capital.
And so that's helped us
build the technology
to then be able to generate
the revenue.
So those are the two
ways.
But you know having our
government, especially when AI
has been a huge driver for
Canada and we've lost our
position, I think that a lot of
the policies that could have
been in place to accelerate the
Canadian adoption and
investment in AI could have put
us in a much, much more
competitive place globally.
>> All right, David, I'm gonna
get you to pick up on that.
But I should mention we have a
statement from the office of
the Minister of Economic
Development, Job Creation and
Trade.
Our government is creating
the conditions for Ontario's
tech businesses, innovators
and workers to thrive.
To support this growth,
we have invested $107 Million
in Ontario's critical
technologies initiatives to
provide access to and drive the
commercialisation of
technologies that will propel
the next generation of
innovation and ensure our
businesses remain competitive.
That includes support for the
Ontario Centre for innovation
and the Vector Institute.
So with all that being said.
>> The they have done some
things not enough, but the
question is do they have
a strategy?
Do they have a strategy
that everyone understands
that all of the firms
in the relevant sectors
understand?
Is it a strategy that's been
based on input from
those firms?
The economists and policy
experts who study these
things differentiate between
old industrial policy, which
was all top down government
directed, and new industrial
policy, which is much more
participatory, collaborative,
that involves firms in the
sectors that are going to be
affected by the policies in
helping design and implement
them.
We don't do that in this
country, and we certainly don't
do it in this province.
And a lot of what we
do is very reactive.
A company will say,
well, we're interested in
investing in Ontario.
Can you help us?
And then the government will
put together a package
of support, particularly
in the automotive,
but occasionally in other
sectors as well.
But we don't lay out a strategy.
>> Is there a difference in
laying out a strategy or
writing that strategy down on
paper?
Is there a difference in
in having it on paper?
>> It doesn't matter whether
it's on paper or whether it's
digital.
It needs to be communicated
to the people you want to,
you know, attract and and grow
in this jurisdiction.
The other thing that industrial
policy does that one off
individual policies don't do,
it looks at what we call the
policy mix.
That is, what is
the broad spectrum of policy
instruments that the government
has available to it.
Tax policy, direct spending,
regulatory policy, procurement.
And how how do you put
together those
that mix of policies to deliver
the maximum benefit to the
companies that you're trying to
grow in Ontario?
>> All right.
With that being said,
let's take a broader look.
Are there any international
markets that we can compete
with?
>> We can't compete head to
head with China.
We can't compete in
head to head with the US
because of our size,
because the the size of our
companies.
What we can do is target
niche markets where we develop
specific expertise,
which is exactly what Stephanie
is doing.
And there are other
software companies in Canada
and Ontario that are doing the
same thing.
And we need to focus on
those niches where we
have distinctive research
expertise that companies can
take and deploy.
And then we need to look at
the mix of policy instruments
that we can mobilise
to give those companies
the support they need
to penetrate those
international markets.
Because, simply put,
Canada's market is too small
to grow an international
technology company to scale.
>> Can you give us an example?
>> Countries where.
>> We have examples?
>> Yeah, we can be selling to
Europe, we can be selling into
the US.
We can be selling to parts
of East Asia.
We certainly can be selling
a lot more to India than we do.
India is probably the largest,
largest population in the world
now.
So one of the largest markets
are foreign relations with India
have not been the best
for the last few years,
but I believe the government is
working hard to rectify that.
That would be a huge market for
us.
>> Stephanie, what do companies
like yours?
We talk about the niche markets,
smaller markets.
What does your what does
your company need to remain
competitive customers?
>> That's the only thing that
matters, right?
My view is like,
you know, there's a lot of
obviously we have to raise
capital.
In my case, this was a
big investment in the tech.
So we've raised about 70 million
USD.
And so we need to raise
the capital.
But the proof points come
if there's a fit
and you're building a
technology that's solving a
real problem, you win customers.
The customers are paying you
money.
They give you feedback.
You build better product that
attracts more customers, that
gives you money.
And then investors are
really attracted
to your company and then they
build better product.
And so, you know,
the one key driver
and I've said this a lot from
the public sector because we
were really fortunate in Covid.
We won the UK government.
We won.
We worked with the
Department of Defence in the US,
but we never won Canada.
And it was not by lack of
trying, but there's so much
lobbying for the company
and trying to get through
to get a contract or
solve real problems because
supply chain was a real problem
and we were in the UK able to
set them up within 48 hours,
with 60,000 manufacturers of
PPE, ISO certified.
With the history of how long
they've been in business
with their contact information.
And so they could start,
you know, going from being
in the front of the paper,
buying PPE from random companies
to actually making sure that
they're buying companies
that met standards.
And, you know, we try to
advocate to get Canada to look
at us as an opportunity to
start looking for goods and
services and either locally or
outside the Anand.
And it was impossible to
work with our government.
And so there's so much,
you know, effort you want
to put in.
I'm better off winning the
Kraft Heinz of this world
and the, you know,
Goldman Sachs of this world
versus trying to knock on a
door that makes it very
difficult for tech companies to
work with its government.
>> Okay.
We'll come back to that.
David.
>> Can I just follow up on
Stephanie's point?
Because we've interviewed tons
of technology companies in
Ontario, and Stephanie's story
is one that I hear over and
over again.
Okay, we do not.
So so in my field of study, we
differentiate between supply
side industrial policies and
demand side industrial policies.
And one of the most valuable
for for companies, for start up
and scale up companies is
government procurement.
We heard over and over again,
you know, when I go into an
international market, the first
question they ask me is, well,
who are you selling to in your
home country, including your
governments or your telcos or
your banks?
And I hear the story over
and over again that
these companies have to make
their first sale
internationally before they can
get anyone in Canada to pay
attention, and getting their
governments to, to purchase.
And by governments, you know,
we don't just mean the actual
government in Ontario, we mean
the whole college, university,
hospital, social services,
municipal sector as well.
Those are huge purchasers,
the crown corporations,
those are enormous markets.
And if we could leverage
their purchasing power
to support companies like
Stephanie's, we'd be a long way
down the road towards having an
effective industrial policy.
>> Well, we know we're in a
time right now where the
sentiment is sort of changed,
where there is, you know,
elbows up by local.
I want to stick with you, David.
The Buy Ontario Act
for procurement, is this
the right move to support?
>> It's a step in the right
direction.
But but if it's just
if it just applies to the
Ontario government, it doesn't
apply to the broader public
sector in Ontario.
If it is, say, targeted to
housing, that's great
or targeted to infrastructure.
But if it's not targeted to
all sorts of technology
products that the government
itself is using or
that the broader public sector
is using, then it's only,
you know, a first step
towards where we need to go.
>> And just to add to that, we
were talking about the best way
to drive behaviour and change
is through policies.
And we've seen, you know,
in the US, for example,
and I know there's a
love and hate relationship
right now, but a good example
is that companies are driven to
buy local or buy from minority
owned businesses due to tax
incentive, for example, or we
have customers who have venture
debt attached with an interest
rate, depending on how much
money they're spending with
minority owned business and
local businesses.
So these are data points
and report that
they have to provide to their
board level to their
shareholders.
So it does drive change.
But if you don't have
that it's just a sentiment
that's Buy Canada because
we're Canadian.
It doesn't drive change
in the way say, hey, we
will give you tax incentive or
we will, you know, give you
some reduction in some of your,
you know, venture debt so that
you can, you know, to drive
change.
And so that's how I think
we could enforce change.
>> David, you got the last word
here.
>> Okay.
So we've we've interviewed
over 100 companies in Ontario
that are trying to scale.
So they're at probably
the same stage that Stefanie's
company is they're out of the
gate.
They're past start-up.
They want to grow.
They want to expand
into international markets.
And we asked them,
what do you need in terms of
policy support to help you
scale to penetrate those global
markets?
It's the same three things
over and over again:
access to capital, access to
talent, access to markets and
where.
And we're we have bits
and pieces both federally and
provincially on all of them.
But we don't have nearly enough.
And where in Ontario last word
right now is really deficient.
Is the access to talent part.
Ontario is spending the least
amount per capita on its
post-secondary education system.
It's the students from that
system that are going to go
feed Stefanie's company and
companies like hers.
And if we can't prioritise
the talent pipeline for for
those technology companies,
we are going to have
an even bigger problem
five, ten years down
the road.
>> All right.
We are going to have to
leave it there.
Stephanie.
David, I really appreciate.
Thank you so much
for your insights.
>> Thank you.
