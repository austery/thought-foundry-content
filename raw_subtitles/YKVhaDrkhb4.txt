Last time I made a video explaining why young people choose to lie down
The audience reacted enthusiastically
The book I’m going to face today is “How to “Do Nothing””
Let me teach you how to lie down flat
The author of this book is Stanford University artist Jenny Odell
The first half of the book
I need to first tell you the philosophy of lying flat
How to escape the capitalist attention economy
The second half will teach you how to turn your attention away from economics
Shift to ecological coexistence and local connections with communities
Realizing the philosophy of resistance to capitalism
Our current legal working hours are eight hours
It was won by the American labor movement at the end of the 19th century.
The sports theme song at that time was sung
"Eight hours of work, eight hours of rest, and eight hours of yourself."
You have eight hours to yourself to bask in the sun and smell the flowers
do something useless
Instead of using it for self-improvement, working overtime, and making extra money
This was the original intention of workers to fight for free time
But Italian philosopher Franco Berardi pointed out
Since the 1980s
Capitalism begins to transform human subjectivity
Commercialize one’s self
Promote a new idea
Everyone can be an entrepreneur
Everyone should treat their lives as a brand competition
Real entrepreneurs can get back up no matter how many times they fail
No matter what happens, make them stronger, do better, be smarter and happier
Therefore, true entrepreneurial spirit must first control one's inner self, not the external reality.
Labor no longer works 8 hours a day
During off-duty hours, you have to freely take on cases, deliver orders, manage social media, and build your personal brand.
The original 8 hours after get off work
It should allow workers not to work
Now these 8 hours have been colonized by capitalism
Everyone thinks of themselves as running their own businesses like capitalists
But life should be optimized
The concept of value maximization itself has problems
This is tantamount to treating life as a tool for making money
Forgot that life experience itself is the purpose
People make money to experience life
But many people live just to make money
The author said
We should resist becoming productive subjects
Study Zhuangzi’s Philosophy
"Zhuangzi." It is recorded in "The Human World":
A carpenter visited a large oak tree
The carpenter said the tree was big and useless
Not suitable for use as wood
If you use it to make a boat, the boat will sink; if you use it to make a coffin, the coffin will rot.
It's a completely worthless tree
As a result, the oak tree told the carpenter in a dream
Do you want to compare me with those valuable trees?
The final fate of those trees is to be chopped down.
It’s just because I’m not good enough and no one can cut me down
On the contrary, you can survive
My uselessness is my greatest use
If I use it, can it still grow such a big tree?
Zhuangzi’s philosophy is particularly relevant in today’s capitalist society
The more one pursues wealth, the more useful he becomes
The better to be exploited by the company
The result is overtime, overwork, and doing it to death
On the contrary, the more useless and wasteful it becomes
The more capitalism takes advantage of you, the more it can do nothing
The best thing in the world is seeing the smiling faces of our guests
I don't care
nothing to do
On the contrary, you can survive
Zhuangzi's philosophy allows us to see that "useful" is actually a very narrow concept.
Precisely because capitalism pursues usefulness
Leading to endless overconsumption and today’s ecological crisis
In comparison
Many important things in life
It has no use value for capitalism
such as household chores such as taking care of the family
Seen as unproductive by capitalism
You do housework and take care of your significant other
The boss won't pay you either
But the entire human species can continue to reproduce
In fact, it depends on the care of caregivers
Capitalism that blindly pursues productivity
Let us neglect those who take care of us
So artist Mierle Laderman Ukeles has done a lot of "maintenance art"
Trying to make visible the care work that capitalism ignores
This kind of care is not limited to people
Can also be extended to non-humans
Like your dog, cat, or pet
They provide you with physical and mental comfort after get off work
These things are regarded by capitalism as unproductive and unprofitable
But they are actually very important to our physical and mental adjustment
So doing nothing is not really doing nothing.
Instead, do things that capitalism deems unproductive
Like doing housework, playing with pets
If your boss asks you to work overtime
We will immediately become a waste
In addition to resisting becoming a productive subject
We must also resist the capitalist attention economy
Every time there is a new message on social media
Many opinion leaders and internet celebrities will speak on Facebook IG
Everyone is trying to steal your attention
Because traffic is business opportunity
These are the capitalist attention economies
To generate more profits in exchange for your reach
Rather than really caring about social connections
So even Bill Gates strictly regulates the time when children can use mobile phones.
Facebook engineer Justin Rosenstein prevents children from downloading apps at will
Twitter engineers even designed a sliding update after
Saying that your design is not good
But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t participate in social media
But we can choose how to participate
It’s okay to reject the ways capitalism wants us to engage
Capitalism can exploit your wages and housing prices
But I can't take away your free will
I can't force you to watch it
So attention is the only resource we have at our disposal
When we turn off our attention, capitalism takes advantage of us
So art critic Jonathan Crary said
Sleep is humanity’s last line of defense against capitalism
This is why capital companies design various addictive games and streaming video platforms
Let you stay up late playing games and watching TV shows
Because as soon as you fall asleep, there is less flow and less contact
Companies can place ads, but users can also divert their attention to resist
every time an ad appears
Just divert your attention
Don't look, don't listen
The philosopher Deleuze believes that
People in contemporary society have the right to say nothing
Today's society is different from the period of authoritarian rule
People are not prohibited from expressing their thoughts
Just the opposite
In a society with free speech, people make too many rubbish comments
Capitalism encourages everyone to speak out
Post more on Facebook and IG
Only in this way can we earn traffic
In an age where people are scrambling to express their opinions
Not publishing anything can give people a breather
A temporary withdrawal from capitalism
When capitalism wants to earn our traffic
Let's show our right to say nothing
There is a concept in the medieval Catholic tradition
It’s called Contemptus Mundi
It is to reject this world spiritually
Think that the pleasures in this world are short-lived and false
Not as good as the eternal God
This concept can also be used to combat today’s attention economy
Although we have physical limitations
It's hard to escape capitalism
But we can still say no to capitalism on a spiritual level
When social media steals our attention
Make you think there is something new every day
New controversies, new YouTube videos
The discussions we see on Facebook are not reality
But the reality created by capitalism
At this time we can revive the medieval "renunciation of the world"
reject this false reality
Don’t read, don’t like, don’t share
retain the right to say nothing
In addition to resisting the attention economy
There is also a more thorough way of lying flat
It’s about escaping capitalism.
A 28-year-old mainland internet celebrity was laid off due to the epidemic
After returning to his hometown in Liaoning, he relied on unemployment benefits to live frugally in the countryside.
I have no ambitions in life, I just want to be a happy layman
The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus can be said to be the earliest ancestor of lying down
He found that urbanites just want to satisfy their empty desires
But never satisfied with what they have
So in order to make more money
You have to work all the time
As a result, it keeps going in circles
Don’t know the source of happiness
So Epicurus left the city and the public
Buy a vegetable garden in the countryside on the outskirts of Athens
Build your own school locally
Trying to use school education to transform people's desires
Epicurus believed
Live a self-sufficient life in the countryside
On the contrary, it allows you to see your desires clearly
You will find that many material desires are created by advertising.
Not that you really want those products
The happiness that people really want is called Ataraxia
What is Ataraxia?
That is, the soul is free from worldly concerns
Get inner peace
The human soul needs more than material satisfaction
But friendship
because of the importance of friendship
Therefore, the Epicurean Academy was the only school at that time that admitted non-Greeks, slaves, and women.
Invite everyone to come and lie down together
Enjoy the happiness of not making money
Look at it from the current perspective
Epicurus’ schools were like “addiction treatment centers”
Human beings are addicted to money and material desires
need to be treated
So lying down is not just passive resistance.
It’s more of a philosophy to treat one’s own desires
Epicurus’s act of escaping from material desires
The hippie movement became popular again in the United States in the 1960s
At that time, young people in the United States were dissatisfied with the government's initiation of the Vietnam War and the apartheid system.
Believe that the older generation and those in power are the source of social chaos
In addition, the Age of Aquarius movement was popular in society at that time.
I think it started in the 1960s
Human civilization has entered Aquarius
Symbolizing the shift from the material level to the spiritual and environmental level
<b>???</b>
Therefore, many young people refuse to buy cars or houses.
Raise money with friends to buy a piece of land in the countryside
Create your own ideal community commune in rural areas
More than 1,000 communes appeared in the United States from 1965 to 1970s
But let’s not think that we can just escape capitalism
can build utopia
The vast majority of people in these communes are middle-class white people
Many people actually bring their existing problems to the communes
For example, men have never washed dishes or cooked before
So in the commune, women are responsible for these things
Many women flee again after discovering these problems
Escape brings the problem outside
Therefore, the ancient Greek philosopher Epictetus once criticized Epicurus:
Are you encouraging everyone to avoid problems?
Neglect of civic responsibilities
If everyone does what you do, they will subvert the country and destroy the family
So the author thinks that we should lie down
It’s not about escaping capitalism and never coming back.
It happened to be after taking a break from myself for a while
Can have a clearer understanding of how the world works
See the world clearly and then return to bring changes
In 2008, Deloitte accounting firm hired an employee
Colleagues asked her what she was doing
She said she didn't do anything, she was just thinking about what to do.
What are you waiting for...?
No, I'm just thinking about what I should do
in the elevator
Colleagues asked her where she was going
She said I wasn't going anywhere
Where are you going?
I'm just waiting in the elevator for a moment
OK
I'm trying this mobile place
Sure
This person has nothing to do in the company
It makes other colleagues very impatient
It was revealed later
It turns out this is an action art piece by artist Pilvi Takala
Deliberately pretending to be an idle employee
unproductive
See how others react
The results are experimentally proven
Idleness has the potential to threaten work order
When you deliberately interrupt your daily work routine
People around you will find it strange
This reflects that we have actually internalized the work order into our bones.
This social experiment is not an escape from capitalism
Instead, actively create a structure of rejection.
Refusal to be a productive subject
the art of refusal
Diogenes, a Cynic who dates back to ancient Greece
The philosophy of Diogenes is to despise everything that the world considers worthy of pursuit.
Because there are cracks in everything society should abide by
For example, he believes that education only makes it easier for young people to find jobs after they leave society.
Instead of teaching people how to live a good life
So the textbook is not worth reading at all
He takes action
Go and glue the textbook pages together
This philosophy of action was very appreciated by Alexander the Great
Came here specially to visit Diogenes
Tell him: If you need anything, just tell me
Diogenes replied:
I need you to get out of the way, you're blocking my sunlight
When the Macedonians were about to attack his city-state Corinth
Everyone is ready to prepare for war
Everyone guessed that Diogenes must have nothing to do again
Unexpectedly, Diogenes was busy pushing his pottery instead
Others ask him what are you doing?
He just said
Make yourself look as busy as you guys
through this irony
Revealing what the secular public considers worthy of busyness
In fact, I'm just pretending to be busy.
You think you are fighting for the economy
Work hard to make money
In fact, it’s all just mediocrity
So Plato called Diogenes the crazy Socrates.
Socrates used dialogue to stimulate people's philosophical thinking
But Diogenes used action art to awaken the world
Unlike Epicurus, who fled to the countryside and built his own utopia
Instead, stay in the city and use your actions to prove that the busyness of urbanites is not worth it.
Diogenes deliberately wanted to stay in this society
Use action to create a rejection in place
Tell you what to do when society asks you to
You just don't do this
Taiwan-born performance artist Hsieh Teh-ching can be said to be the Taiwanese version of Diogenes
His artistic performances are full of rejection on the spot
For example, his 1985 work "No Art Piece"
Just don’t create anything for a whole year
Not looking at works of art
Not talking about art
Living a life without art for a year
Why is this kind of doing nothing an art?
Xie Deqing said
People always say that to make life full of meaning, you must fill up your time
But what if we clear the time?
Hsieh Teh-ching's performance art is like a kind of in-situ rejection of Taiwanese society
Because children in Taiwan have their schedules filled up by their parents since childhood.
As if this is a productive life
Only when you grow up can you have a good job
Taiwanese people all live this kind of arranged punch-in life.
Reject this violent structure
Hsieh Deqing lived a life of doing nothing for a year
This kind of rejection is an art of living
I would say all I'm doing is living
Because all art comes from life
Live life, live art, that is, spend time
Let time pass, that's what I'm doing
Rejection on the spot can sometimes even lead to social change
Like Thoreau, the founder of American civil disobedience
He once went to live in seclusion by Walden Pond and lay in bed for two years.
Thoreau said:
I stay away from the crowd and live a simple life in a cabin because I want to live cautiously
See what things are fundamental to life
Eliminate all unnecessary things in life
So that when I die, I will realize that I have never lived at all
The two years of seclusion experience
Allowed Thoreau to look at American society at that time from a distance
At that time, Americans were all flocking to praise slavery.
Waging war against Mexico
But Thoreau wrote "On Civil Disobedience":
American soldiers who went to fight in Mexico are no more worthy of respect than a piece of soil
He advocated "If the essence of the law is to make you an accomplice to injustice, then I would say, just break the law."
If enough people in society choose to exercise moral judgment
Instead of continuing to play this unfair game
Then this game has a chance to change
This theory of civil disobedience became a political philosophy
Further influence on later Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr.
And the reason why Thoreau was able to refine this theory
It was because of his seclusion experience that he was able to change his perspective
Looking at problems from outside the system
Of course, not everyone can easily practice "refuse on the spot"
If you are already a low-paid person
It’s too late to work hard to make money to support the family
It's impossible to say I won't go to work tomorrow
This is why mass rejection campaigns always happen to students
Because students don’t need to support their families yet
Can resist state violence and capitalism regardless of the consequences
Now let's do an attention experiment
Please count the people looking at the white shirts
How many times did they pass the ball in total?
The answer is 16 times
But when you count the times
Have you noticed
A chimpanzee appears on the screen
This experiment was designed by psychologist Daniel Simons
Used to prove that people cannot see things outside their attention span
You can't see the chimpanzee if you only look at the man in the white shirt
Inattentional
blindness
We often ignore what is right in front of us
Capitalism has caused people in contemporary society to suffer from inattentional blindness
Just swiping on my phone
Not paying attention to things around you
Because there are always new messages on our phones to distract us
Within a few minutes I wanted to check my phone
In fact, William James, the father of psychology, discovered long ago
Human attention is inherently
Just assume that there must be something new to pay attention to
So attention tends to be attached to new things
Distraction is normal
On the contrary, it requires willpower to concentrate.
So resist the attention economy
We must allow things that we have not noticed before to enter our consciousness.
What to do?
We can create a structure that focuses attention
Imagine when you fall in love
You'll feel like the world around you completely disappears
Because all your attention is on your lover
This is how love creates a structure of attention
Many works of art can achieve the same effect
For example, artist Scott Polach curated art exhibitions
「Applause encouraged」Applause encouraged
in this exhibition
Participants are prohibited from using mobile phones
I could only sit there and watch the sunset for 30 minutes
When the sun goes down, please applaud
This brief detachment
Let your attention be focused on the sunset
After it’s over, you’ll see the world from a new perspective
Another more famous example
It's 4 minutes and 33 seconds of American musician John Cage
Nothing is played in this piece of music
You can't hear any piano sound for 4 minutes and 33 seconds
Only the small sounds from the audience are heard
So in fact, every performance is performed by the audience present.
Let the audience feel that all the sounds around us can be music
What's even more amazing is
After leaving the concert hall
You will find that the world you hear becomes different
Because the performance of 4 minutes and 33 seconds creates a rupture of attention
after a moment of silence
On the contrary, it will highlight the subtle sounds after amplification
Every sound around you becomes crystal clear
Your ears finally truly hear the world
This is taking advantage of a moment of idleness
to create the structure for yourself to focus
When we are commuting to and from get off work
Most people probably use their mobile phones on the MRT and buses.
Focus on the online space
And ignore the strangers around you
Or every time there is an earthquake in Taiwan
The first thing many people do is post on Facebook
Originally, the earthquake was supposed to be a natural disaster that brought people back from the Internet to reality.
But our attention is controlled by social media
In fact, encounters in cyberspace
You saw the post on Facebook
Or dating software, online communities
All set according to your preferences
has very clear instrumental value
Exclude people you don’t want to see
in other words
Encounter in cyberspace is a created reality
Deliberately use your preferences to attract your attention
In the end, we will only come into contact with people who have the same opinions and interests as us
But the real philosophy of lying down
We must reject the utilitarian orientation of capitalism
Make friends without purpose
Resisting the attention economy
look at the strangers around you
Might not help your career
Doesn't make you more productive
There is no way for you to find love
But treat strangers with a Buddhist mentality
On the contrary, it will bring more surprises in life
Such encounters with strangers are not limited to humans
Can also be non-human
Because animals and plants can also be our neighbors
In fact, before the 18th century, capitalism had not yet expanded to all parts of the world.
Many aboriginal languages ​​use anthropomorphic titles to describe mountains, rivers and land.
But in the process of capitalist colonization
These deep relationships with animals and plants have been belittled as "superstition" and "unscientific"
Many Aboriginal languages ​​have been lost
Learn the colonizer's language instead
That is English
In English, it is used to refer to animals and plants
Treat animals and plants as lower than humans
Ignores hundreds of years of interaction between human ancestors and plants and animals
In fact, both parties have evolved together
Ecologist Robin Wall Kimmerer points out:
The aborigines of North America have collected a plant called cogongrass since ancient times.
This collection habit has made cogongrass gradually become dependent on humans.
If humans collect too much, it will damage the ecology
But if humans don’t collect it, this species will become extinct.
Plants and humans need each other's attention to survive
So resisting the attention economy is not passively resisting capitalism.
Instead, we actively return attention to local ecological areas.
Environmental campaigner Peter Berg calls this
<b>Bioregionalism</b>
Bioregionalism
Stop treating humans as the center
Animals, plants, mountains and forests can all be our neighbors
Start to get to know the local animals, plants, mountains, forests, and rivers
and think about how humans and local ecology depend on each other
For example, in Taiwan, 500,000 purple-spotted butterflies used to come to Taiwan to spend the winter every year.
But capitalism causes global warming
As a result, the number of purple-spotted butterflies coming to Taiwan is decreasing.
As a result, people’s eyeballs cannot be separated from their mobile phones
You won’t notice that the surrounding ecology has been changed by capitalism
On the contrary, Taiwan's aboriginal Rukai people regard the purple-spotted butterfly as a friend.
When friends stop visiting your home this year
Let them be alert to the seriousness of the problem
This bioregionalism is a revolt against capitalism
Because capitalism hopes to cut off the connection between man and nature
Let people regard nature as a resource that can be commodified
The last step in fighting the attention economy
Just focus on localization
When we lie down and scroll through Facebook and IG
See gossip news, industry matches, celebrity controversies
Our brains are actually unable to organize this content into a meaningful whole
Because they are not related to each other in the first place
Media scholar Danah Boyd calls this a breakdown in context
The success of many personal brands and Internet celebrities is to take advantage of the collapse of the context
In order to make their posts and videos reach more audiences
They often interpret things out of context
This way you can please everyone
Therefore, social media and self-media do not actually promote discussion.
Instead, it causes the veins to disappear
Resist the business logic of capitalism’s pursuit of traffic
We can re-localize communities
The philosopher Hannah Olam pointed out
many social changes in history
It all happens in the space of appearance (space of appearance)
Such as cafes, bars, parks
People show up in real space, discuss and act together
The arguments from both sides stirred up new sparks
Only then will new collective strength be generated
But on social media
The two sides with different opinions usually become more polarized the more they discuss it.
Instead, in the space of the real world
Can filter out the villagers who only have one mouth to speak
For example, a park is a space for showing up
Because the park you see now
Each relies on local residents showing up to resist capitalist land development.
Only then can it survive
For example, Glen Canyon Park in San Francisco
There is a trail called Gum Tree Girls
It is to commemorate the three women who took the lead in blocking the then government
to have the highway go through this canyon park
Parks are a successful example of resistance to capitalism
So to understand who in the past successfully protected the park we see now
It’s a way to connect with the local community
Showing up to resist also debunks the productivity myth of capitalism
Capitalism believes that productivity is building new things
But actually
Many new constructions are destroying original ecosystems, communities, and public spaces
It’s just that these damages are invisible to capitalism
So we should not mistakenly think that lying down means opposing progress.
The lie-flat philosophy just proves that doing nothing can make more progress than capitalism
For example, the Japanese agriculturist Masanobu Fukuoka
He invented a natural farming method that does nothing.
He once saw an abandoned field covered with green grass
Discover that the land has its own wisdom
Therefore, we came up with a farming method that does not require fertilizers or irrigation.
Direct sow seeds in the fall and use clover instead of traditional fertilizers
Not deliberately pursuing capitalist agricultural productivity
On the contrary, it can lead to more prosperous orchards
Masanobu Fukuoka wrote this philosophy in the book "The Revolution of a Straw"
Shocking the Western Ecological Circle
West Berkeley local government in the United States in 2017
Want to build a building on the site of a local Aboriginal shell midden
He said he wanted to turn this place into a profitable commercial space.
Local residents collectively protest
Request that the sanctity of this site be preserved
cannot be commercialized
Instead, they sing, dance and hold ceremonies locally
Tribal leader Ruth Orta worked with even landscape architects
Transform an underground shell mound into a large-scale memorial site
The site has no commercial value
But it can let the world witness local culture
This is the real progress of a society
In today’s video, we systematically introduce the philosophy of lying flat
Zhuangzi’s philosophy teaches us to resist the subject of productive forces
The more useless I am
The more capitalism takes hold of me, there is nothing I can do
Deleuzian philosophy teaches us the right to say nothing
There is something new on social media that we need to leave a message for
we just stay silent
Epicurean philosophy teaches us to cure our desires
See clearly that the material desires instilled by capitalism cannot make people happy at all
The philosophy of Diorgnes and Thoreau teaches us to refuse on the spot
When capitalism is rife with injustice
We must practice civil disobedience
Bioregionalism teaches us to turn our attention to local ecology
Rebuilding the connection between people and nature
Repair the ecological environment destroyed by capitalism
Hanna-Olan's philosophy teaches us the space to show up
Show up to resist and protect the unproductive things
On the contrary, it can bring real progress to society
