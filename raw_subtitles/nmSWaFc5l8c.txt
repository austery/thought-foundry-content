>> Do you remember when
the Taliban fell in 2001?
There was hope.
Things in Afghanistan were
changing.
Things like greater
human rights, stronger
democratic institutions and
education for women and girls
in Canada committed to helping
being part of all of that.
Between 2001 and 2014, over
40,000 Canadian Armed Forces
personnel served in Afghanistan.
It was our largest deployment
since the Second World War.
But in 2021, things changed.
The Taliban regained power.
Since then, Canada has suspended
diplomatic operations in
Afghanistan has largely faded
from the headlines.
What the story of a hotel in
Kabul tells us about the
turbulent history of a country
and its people.
Welcome to The Rundown.
Before it was ruled by
the Taliban, Kabul was known
as the Paris of Central Asia,
and at the centre of it all
was the city's first luxury
hotel, the Intercontinental.
Since it opened in 1969,
it has seen coups and wars,
liberation and re-occupation.
I talked to Lyse Doucet,
chief international
correspondent for the BBC,
about her new book, The Finest
Hotel in Kabul, and how looking
at the history of a single
building can be a window into
the history of a nation.
Lyse, thank you so much
for joining us.
Welcome to our program.
How are you doing?
>> I'm even happier because
I'm here in the studio.
It's cold outside,
but it's so nice.
It's nice and warm.
I've been many times to TVO
over the over the years,
and it's always really nice
to come back here.
I sort of feel I'm coming home.
I went to university
in Toronto, so it's one of
my many homes.
So thank you very much.
>> Great to have you.
Great to have you back.
Let's talk about your
reporting.
You've reported in
Afghanistan and about
Afghanistan since 1988.
We actually have a photo
of you.
This is back in 1989.
Tell us what we're looking at
here.
This is a young Lyse Doucet
right here.
>> Yes.
This is Lyse Doucet,
who grew up on the eastern
shores of Canada in New
Brunswick and grew up wanting
to be a foreign correspondent.
The only evidence I have for
that is that I found one time
in all the old boxes, a late
slip for my local library,
and the book was How To Become
A Journalist.
I don't know if I returned
the book, but the book was
late and I'm sure it has
cost me.
Could cost me a lot of money.
And that was my I first
started out.
I spent five years
in West Africa and then
I went to Pakistan, Afghanistan
and in Iran.
And that picture was that
really was the big story of our
time, the war in Afghanistan,
which was in the Cold War.
Kabul was in the crosshairs of
this global confrontation.
A Soviet-backed government in
Kabul fighting against the
Western and and regional states
backed mujahideen.
And it was the most grievous
war of our time.
It was the biggest migration
crisis.
And there I was, a young
journalist.
I arrived on Christmas Day,
the day after my 30th birthday,
and found myself with
the biggest story in the world.
All the eyes of the world
were on Afghanistan.
>> With that being said, why
decide to write this book now?
>> I don't need to tell you.
I think it's something
we worry about.
Jeyan is we we have this
expression in our in our
profession, news avoidance that
people are turning away from
the news.
And I find myself in
my kitchen in London, turning
the dial on the radio away from
the news channels to classical
music and thinking, oh so
depressing, so many wars,
so many.
But of course we live in
democracies.
We have the gift of living in
societies where we can live
a life with the values
and principles that we hold
dear.
So we have to turn back
the dial, or on the TV, or on
the radio or on on our phones.
And I wanted to explore a
different kind of storytelling
because, as you know, in our
news business, if you watch
the news on TV and it could be
Afghanistan, it could be
Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan, it's just
a snapshot.
We see people in
these in these societies
and people in great distress,
people running for their lives
away from from the bombs
wailing in the rubble of their
homes, moaning in the hospital
the worst of their times.
But of course, that's just
one part of their lives.
And what I have found in
all of the places I
have worked with.
And it doesn't have to be
places far away.
You could talk about hard
times, many parts of of Canada,
people still have to get up,
have a cup of tea or coffee and
find an everyday courage to
face the day with a measure of
hope humour I have found.
I don't know whether you'd
agree that humour is not just
the universal language,
but it's the sharpest of
skills for people to survive
in the darkest of times.
And Afghans have a sense of
humour in great abundance.
And people celebrate birthdays
and, and and weddings
and celebrations.
And I wanted to I wanted to
use the power of literature
to expand the horizons and to,
if I may so boldly say,
to open hearts and empathy
for people to look at
these societies in a different
kind of way.
And maybe I'll tell you
a Toronto story, that
exploring this kind of
storytelling for me goes way
back to when I was a graduate
student at the University of
Toronto, and I still I still
remember the day it was a cold,
grey, drizzly day, and I was
down on Queen Street with
in a cafe.
There weren't as many cafes
then in a cafe, and I was
reading Truman Capote's In Cold
Blood, and I remember finishing
it.
And you read a book and you
just it you feel the enormity
of this book and you want to
savour it.
And I was dazzled.
I thought, wow, that you can
use the convention of fiction,
a novel, to tell a non-fiction,
a true story.
And as then I just that was
when I just had this dream
of becoming a journalist
and I thought, this is amazing.
Now, never mind that since then,
people think that Truman Capote
might have made up a little bit,
but I'm a journalist through
and through, so I didn't.
Those are all the stories
in there.
In there are.
True.
So that stayed with me.
And when I started to travel,
I would often turn would,
would usually turn to novels
into what we call
narrative history, where
history comes alive on the page,
characters come to life as the
best way to immerse myself in
places and people that I was
visiting for the first time.
And so when I decided I was
ready to to write a book, it
seemed to be I'd start writing
and I would I would stop
and I would think, why are you
writing it like this?
And I thought, because
that I would.
I was hoping it was the way
to draw people.
>> Well, when people read this,
this is while you are giving us
a history lesson, the way that
you are able to weave in these
complex stories of, of of both
hardship but also joy and the
laughter of of of the folks who
lived and worked at the
Intercontinental Hotel there.
Help us understand sort of
those relationships.
Who were the first people
you met and what were
those connections like?
>> The.
So if you want to tell,
you know, we say in our
profession, the story,
in the story, I need it.
You know, literally they they
talk about a conceit
or prism, like, how was I
going to tell this very
turbulent, this very tumultuous
story of in Afghanistan in a
way that we have this great,
great author here in Canada,
Margaret Atwood, and she says
that I called it the Margaret
Atwood test that she says, read
five pages and you want to keep
reading or not?
I had to keep people
turning the pages.
So I needed a story.
So how what would be
the place or the person?
Even the building,
as I thought, that could tell
this story.
And for me, the
inter-continental Kabul, as you
say, Afghanistan's first luxury
hotel, which was opened with
great fanfare in September of
1969 when Afghanistan was a
kingdom.
Not a perfect kingdom,
but it was a time before war.
And Afghans now remember that
as the golden years.
And but in a country
where people have
lost so much, they haven't lost
their deeply ingrained sense
of hospitality.
And on top of it,
that was my first Afghan home
when I first arrived there,
as I mentioned, that was where
I stayed wondering when
I arrived on that cold, dark
Christmas Day.
You know, the lobby was dark,
there was the marble floor,
but there was the chandeliers
from the ceiling were
dimmed by dust, and they were,
most of them shut off
to save electricity.
And I wondered, oh my God,
how am I going to stay?
This mausoleum?
And I ended up staying
nearly a year.
So the people who so the
the Intercontinental Hotel was
my first Afghan home.
And the people who kept
the hotel running,
the room service cashier.
Who's in it?
Amanullah, the waiters,
the front desk people.
They became my first
Afghan friends.
So again, I was hoping to tell
an Afghan story through this
iconic building where so much
history has gone through this,
this hotel, and also to
the lives of these people.
Because although they
can't tell everything about
Afghanistan, they their lives
are threaded through the
history and how they kept going
and the hotel kept going.
And in a place where so much,
especially in the Civil War of
the 19, was reduced to charred
ruins, the intercontinental
Kabul never closed its doors.
In a way, it's a metaphor for a
country which, for all that has
happened, good and bad, has
never given in and never given
up.
>> Well, with that, I want to
actually read a passage from
your book.
It reads, "A Soviet helicopter
gunship was hovering ominously
above while a clutch of
bearded men on a nearby hill
defiantly shook their fists and
old British rifles at it.
Journalists, always the first
to rush towards a racket of any
kind, leaned over the rails of
their balconies.
Afghan hotel staff
weren't far behind,
spilling into the forecourt,
fixating on the gunship with
bated breath, the chopper
paused.
Then it swooped,
sending the fist shakers diving
for cover.
The helicopter held
its fire, tilting sideways,
turning back towards the city.
A round of applause rose from
the intercoms ringside balcony
seats.
The men with guns on the
next hill dusted themselves off.
The hotel staff went back to
work."
To what extent did conflict
just become part of the routine
for those living in Afghanistan?
>> It's sad.
I've always been struck by
Afghan history, and maybe
some of the historians
who are your are your loyal
viewers may have a better idea
than me, but I would wager that
it's one of the few countries
in the world which has lived
through every possible
political system.
The world has tried,
and many of them have failed.
They had, as I mentioned,
a peaceable kingdom.
They had Soviet backed
communism.
They had warlordism,
which tore much of Kabul,
including the parts of the
inter-continental apart.
They had Islamism under
the Taliban.
They had a wannabe democracy
backed by the West, including
Canada.
And now they have Islamism
again under the Taliban.
And in each chapter of
this war, and every time the
rulers changed the rules at the
intercontinental changed,
because after the
Inter-Continental, when Soviet
troops rumbled in in 1979,
this luxury intercontinental
chain pulled out.
So it became a government
owned hotel.
So whoever ruled Afghanistan
set the rules that the intercon
and what you will see in the
books, you know, my my
publishers always say,
don't say lies.
If you read my book,
you have to say.
When you read my book.
So I've compromised and said,
if and when,
if and when you read my book,
you will find how
their lives.
Because at the end
of the day, and this is another
thing that I've really been
struck by.
And you don't you
don't have to go all the way to
Afghanistan to find this.
Is that people there for all
that the whirlwind that they
were constantly their lives
being swept up in, they kept
this pride and dignity,
this honour of.
They were working in this
national guest house, and they
did it with pride and dignity.
And some of them would say to
me, this is the best hotel in
the world.
And of course, it was
the only hotel in the world
that they'd ever been in.
So for them, it was
the best hotel.
And for those like Hazrat,
who's the oldest character in
his 70s, he was so proud that
he had been trained by the
proper Intercontinental Hotel.
And he was.
Whenever the rules changed,
new rules came in.
He would make it clear to them
that he knew everything there
was to know about running a
proper a proper hotel.
And so this hotel became it.
Even one of my publishers
said, Liz, are you sure
that all that history
went through the hotel?
And then later he goes, wow,
so much, so much happened there
in this, in this building.
And, you know, you mentioned
the passage you took to to read
from.
It underlines how when
the hotel started.
So you have to imagine
at that time, 1969,
when when Kabul, at least part
of Kabul, was described as the
Paris of Asia.
This was when Juan Trippe,
who was the enterprising,
the visionary entrepreneur,
set up Panamanian
Pan American Airways Fly the
World.
And then he built the
Intercontinental hotel chain.
And this hotel rose in a
country where there's so many
of these old royal palaces with
their curved windows and
scalloped walls and tall.
Here was this modern palace of
glass and steel
on a pine covered hill
on the edge of the city,
and the facade of the hotel was
200 balconies, like eyes, you
know, looking out over the city.
And literally at that moment it
rose above the city's cares
because it was an elite place.
People with a fortune, those
fortunate in life, the wealthy
tourists.
But over the arc of
this 50 year history that I
cover, the hotel gradually be,
you know, went from witness of
to everything happening to
having and the most spectacular
view watchpost of Kabul.
People went there just to see
the the city by day
and the lights of the city
by night, but it got dragged
into the front line of the war.
And the passage you cited
is when, during the Soviet
times, where you had the
Soviet helicopter helicopter
gunships and again, that was
the best to watch this sound
and light show, which was both
awesome, but also terrifying,
because then it was, you know,
the all the weaponry of war of
the Soviet of the Soviet Union.
>> Now the Intercontinental or
the Intercon, regardless of who
was running it, it still it was
still known as the Intercon
stood strong regardless of of
leadership and had to learn to
adapt.
You had mentioned Hazrat.
We have a photo of him.
This is him who began
working as you mentioned
in the hotel in 1971.
What did change feel like
to them?
>> They tried to still hold on
there.
You see?
You see his white shirt
and if you look, it was
close enough, a little bit
frayed.
He himself, you know,
he's over six feet.
He's a former boxer.
But there he is,
still showing up for work
and the window is shattered.
So you can see in the in the
reflection of the window, some
of the spectacular landscape of
Kabul.
And in the distance, the
mighty Hindu Kush, the
mountains of mountains which
ring the city with their cape
of glistening white snow.
But he's seeing it through
the cracked glass.
And he took me to that room.
It was on the the first floor,
because when they when
the one new set of rulers
after another came up, they
never had enough money to the
government of the day, never
had enough money to renovate it.
And so even though they were
trying to renovate some of them,
you know, he would take me in
and there's holes where the
bullet.
And that was the result
of one of the spectacular
suicide bombings.
There was 1 in 2011, the first
and the second was 2018.
And he had such a again
in a in a place where
people have lost so much.
I would say to Hazrat and
others, do you have any
photographs?
Do you have any videos
from your wedding at the
Intercontinental?
And they go, no, I lost it
when I was forced out of
my home.
I, you know, it
was destroyed when my home was
attacked and but their memory
was their memory was so sharp.
And I began to believe that for
people who have lost so much,
the mementos of their lives,
that memory becomes a weapon to
hold on to what you hold dear.
Because nobody can take what's
inside your head.
And he remembered.
He remembered what
it was like to be there in the
early 70s and Jeyan the first,
the first time I went to the
hotel and tried to talk to to
some of the hotel staff, I'm
going to be writing a book.
Do you want to be in the book?
My first conversation then with
Hazrat was he actually mimicked
the wealthy tourists, you know,
the the throwing the the towel
over the shoulder, white, soft,
plush.
Don't we love them?
I'm sure all your viewers say we
all love a hotel and a luxury
hotel if we can.
If we can manage.
So he mimicked it, and
he remembered how they would
glide across the marble floor
with their white shirts and
skirts on their way to the
tennis courts or the swimming
pool.
And of course, for him
and he, because it oozed
privilege and a life of ease.
It was it was a world apart
from his world.
The eldest of ten children,
his father died when he was
just a teenager.
So he had to leave.
He had to leave high school.
He enrolled in hotel school.
And so again, he of course,
everyone who works in a hotel,
the business of hospitality
is serving and taking pride
in serving your guests.
And they still they still
have that.
So he some of the others
didn't want to take part
because they worried about
repercussions.
At a time when the war
was intensifying, the Taliban
were advancing.
There would be questions,
but he was so excited
because, again, for him,
this was he said, you know,
in the 70s, this was possibly
the best hotel in the world.
Okay, maybe it was the second
best hotel in the world.
But again, that sort of sense
of and they all said to me that
this hotel was like their
second home.
And I had an Afghan colleague
who worked with me
who's zubaidi, and I have to
emphasise that I couldn't have
done a book like this
without a dear Afghan
colleague who helped not just
to translate from Dari and
Pashto, but to help me
understand the emotions and
experiences of of Afghans
living through these times.
And, you know, there's a great
expression by our great
novelist Robertson Davies,
which I've always loved, what's
bred in the bone and that we
are who we are from our
ancestry, from the DNA passed
on from generations.
And even though someone like,
like me has spent decades
of my life going in and out
of Afghanistan,
it's a story that has which is
not a story for me.
It's part of my personal life.
And even though I speak
some Dari not, I wish it was,
wish it was better.
I will never know as much as an
Afghan knows.
So it was really important
for me that he be with me
at my to help me understand
all of the what really
Afghans were going through.
>> You talk about memories, and
I want to talk about one
specific moment that I think
when we look at not just the
Western world, not just in
Afghanistan, but the entire
world took a moment.
It was September 2001, 9/11.
And I want to understand,
because you wrote, that the
well-informed Afghans
understood that their country,
so cut off from much for so
long, was now being pushed into
the centre of world attention.
How did 911 affect Afghan
Afghanistan?
We know very well how much
that impact was.
But for the people.
>> In the picture, picture
a country this is 2001.
Afghanistan at that point is
has been under nearly five
years of Taliban rule.
The first time the Taliban
took power.
And this was really then
of the fighters who came from
the villages, which they even
themselves will say had almost
no knowledge of the world.
And they were under
international sanctions.
There were no flights into
Afghanistan, there were no
telephones working, no
international telephone lines.
If Afghans wanted to make
a call, they had to go to
neighbouring Pakistan to make a
call.
It felt like the city
felt like it had been pushed
back into the last century.
And so when they heard on the
crackly radio, many of them
listened to the BBC in Dari and
Pashto that somewhere far away
in New York, North York meant
nothing to them in their closed
world, and also that there was
more than 100 stories.
And they like how, you know,
the biggest, the biggest
building skyscraper in Kabul
was 18 stories high.
And it had it was legendary
because it was so, so high
and how to begin to understand.
But of course, it quickly became
clear to them, as you mentioned,
that this was going to come
home to Afghanistan because
their guests, of all guests,
was Osama bin laden.
In fact, as I write in the book,
he was a guest at
the Intercontinental Hotel,
but they only knew him
as Osama.
And it was one of the
first stories that the Afghan,
some of the Afghan staff told
me when I when I started
researching the book, they said,
you know, there was this guest.
He never came in the front door.
He came in the back door
and he had a special entrance.
He had two rooms up on
the second floor.
He had his own cooks.
He had his own cleaners.
He and he, he had these
Arabs with him.
And he went would go up to the
roof with the telescope and
they'd look out across the city
and all these gadgets and
computers.
His name was Osama.
And then when 9/11 happened,
they heard Osama bin laden.
They go.
>> Put it together.
>> That's our that's our,
that's our guest.
And and of course,
there was all these warnings
to, to the Taliban.
And again, Afghans were
listening, were listening on,
on their, on their radios to
see what would what would
happen, what would happen next.
And those who have I mean, it's
a date that's seared in memory.
It's a date where the world,
the really world stood up.
And Canada, of course,
being so close by.
And, you know, that
ominous foreboding that the
warnings from the United States,
if you don't give up Osama bin
laden, we blame him for these
attacks.
He must be brought to
the United States and the
Taliban, saying, get back to my
point about hospitality.
They say hospitality
is in our pashtunwali, the
pashtunwali, our tribal code.
We we can't give him up.
We can't give him up
to his enemies and then them
not really believing that the
Americans and the British and
other countries that got
involved.
Canada too, got involved in
that US-led invasion of
Afghanistan, that they would
actually come and attack.
And they did, of course.
And that was the Afghanistan
was turned upside down because
it ended the Taliban regime.
And I have to say, Jeyan at
that moment to be in Kabul,
I went I went in as soon as it
was, the journalists could go
in.
We went in from
neighbouring Pakistan.
And for a moment Afghans
savoured that.
This was the they thought, we
all thought the best chance in
a generation that this country
would finally move away from
war and towards peace.
And for a while, for a while,
that's what it was like.
It was.
So it was delicious.
>> We have a few minutes left.
I have two more questions for
you.
When people read this,
they are going to pick up on
a theme of empathy.
Empathy for the people
on the ground whose lives
are affected, for better
or for worse, by the conflicts
outside of their control.
You've spoken about the
difficulties reporting on Gaza
with no international
journalists anywhere near the
borders, and I wanted to get
your understanding of how you
think social media has changed
the way we report on conflict
zones today, because you're
able to put a face to the
people impacted.
But in a day where we are
constantly bombarded by
conflict, you know,
we were talking about about
that, you know, turning the
radio down, classical music
a little.
But yeah, tell me a little bit
about how how that impacts
how we process it.
>> It's it's interesting
in a very skilled way.
You have brought our
conversation back to where
we began talking as as
colleagues, both both
journalists.
And you commented
on much as you've got this
great studio, you want to get
out, you want to get out and
meet people.
And that's what I also tried
to do in my job.
Social media has this power,
this intensity.
We can see it, we can hear it,
even feel it.
Something happening so far away
we get drawn into it.
But I think you would agree
with me.
And because you've already said
it, I still believe that there
is no alternative to old
fashioned face to face in the
heat or the cold kind of
journalism.
You know, this is
the, the, the beautiful paradox
of our time that I always say
everything has changed
and nothing has changed
in journalism.
For all of the
dazzling changes in technology,
it's still the old fundamentals
to and that is the the best
possible way to try to get as
close as possible to the truth,
to be there, to be there where
it's happening.
And that is one
of the greatest gifts, but also
one of the greatest
responsibilities of our job.
Because when you meet people
face to face, there's that
extra, you feel it that you
have to get that story, story
right.
Any attack on independent
journalism and could it
can be in podcasting
and streaming and all that.
But any of the attack on that
is an attack on the democracy
that we hold dear and the
values.
So we continue.
We have to fight.
Don't we have to fight for
journalism now?
And I say to students
in journalism, now that
journalism as we know it
is going to live or die in
their generation, and it and
its fate also depends on our
listeners, our viewers, those
who consume our now, we call it
content and understanding that
knowing what is happening on
our street, in our
neighbourhood, in our city,
places far away which are
actually are not far away,
places like Afghanistan are
threaded through our own
history, is incumbent upon us
as as citizens.
We don't.
I mean, obviously
we don't have to be glued
to our the news all the time.
And sometimes it's
difficult to find hope
and optimism, but we all have to
get up and face these these
days and, and our times.
And I would like to say
one last thing, because
I think it, it may be on
the minds of the of
your, your many, many viewers
is that people say, well, what
was it for in Afghanistan?
We did engage.
We sent our troops.
We sent our diplomats.
We sent our goodwill.
We spent money over there.
Our troops were on
the ground, some 40,000 troops.
For ten years.
We lost 158 soldiers.
This caused pain which exists
to this day.
Was it for nothing?
And I always say no.
You helped to create a
space where a new generation
came of age in Afghanistan.
And you see in my book, but not
just my book, but since we're
talking about my book, where a
new generation of of young
Afghan men and women were
became the most educated,
connected generation in history,
they they could dream bigger
than ever before.
Women could dream
of being doctors, lawyers,
presidents, whatever.
And that spirit that we helped
to create is still there.
It's in the minds of the girls
who are desperate.
You know, they're getting on
to onto social media
or onto online schools or
they're accessing the internet.
I was listening to Malala
Yousafzai, the education
activist, and she was saying,
the girls she's in touch with,
even reading a book now in
Taliban Afghanistan, is an act
of defiance.
And that was our commitment
to Afghanistan.
We would have liked it to
work out differently,
but none of us should think
that it was for nothing.
But we should take a lesson,
lessons from that,
about different ways to engage
in countries and cultures which
are not our own.
But we are all in this together.
>> I think we're going to leave
it on that lesson, please.
Thank you so much.
>> It's really lovely to meet
you.
>> Thank you.
I could listen to you all day.
>> And I could listen to you
all day.
>> Thank you so much.
>> Really appreciate it.
>> We are building this show
