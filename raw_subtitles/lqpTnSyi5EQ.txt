[Speaker 1]:  let's move onto the second topic，
[Speaker 1]:  which is the texas senate，
[Speaker 1]:  specifically the nine district in texas。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  i recently looked into this。
[Speaker 1]:  this district used to be a heavily republican district and trump one by a large margin of over ten points last time。
[Speaker 1]:  but then a democrat one，
[Speaker 1]:  the seat，
[Speaker 1]:  as we initially discussed，
[Speaker 1]:  such a sudden shift of over ten points，
[Speaker 1]:  whether from red to blue or vice versa，
[Speaker 1]:  was usually due to the contrast provided by the opponent，
[Speaker 1]:  has gow to gone。
[Speaker 1]:  a famous chinese comedian would say，
[Speaker 1]:  right，
[Speaker 1]:  looking at the person in the picture at first plance。
[Speaker 1]:  i might stereotypically assume they are republican。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  this person is a former air force member of veteran。
[Speaker 1]:  his opponent is a woman。
[Speaker 1]:  you know，
[Speaker 1]:  the republican candidate is a woman。
[Speaker 1]:  so you find it very interesting，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  looking at the people running for office。
[Speaker 1]:  you might initially think the woman is a democrat right in this district，
[Speaker 2]:  trump，
[Speaker 2]:  one by a double digit marin of seventeen percentage points in two hundred four。
[Speaker 1]:  that's a huge advantage in a red state，
[Speaker 1]:  right in this small district prased。
[Speaker 1]:  he had a double digit，
[Speaker 1]:  even a large double digit led。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  in the twenty twenty twenty six special election for the state senate，
[Speaker 1]:  the results flip by fourteen points，
[Speaker 1]:  a total swing of thirty one points。
[Speaker 1]:  that's a huge shift。
[Speaker 1]:  a super upset why this area has basically been controlled by the republican party for decades，
[Speaker 1]:  and SD nine is even more conservative than the county。
[Speaker 1]:  it's in。
[Speaker 1]:  it's one of the most conservative districts in the county，
[Speaker 1]:  the republican party strongly endorsed him。
[Speaker 1]:  trump posted about him on truth，
[Speaker 1]:  social，
[Speaker 1]:  which i'll show you later，
[Speaker 1]:  and several high profile figures endors him。
[Speaker 1]:  furthermore，
[Speaker 1]:  this candidate isn't a trump er hino republican in name，
[Speaker 1]:  only he's a very staunch maga supporter and a culture warrior，
[Speaker 1]:  a culture warrior。
[Speaker 1]:  and he still lost by thirty one points。
[Speaker 1]:  wow。
[Speaker 1]:  well，
[Speaker 1]:  actually，
[Speaker 1]:  one major factor is the significant decline in lltino voters support for the republican party and the significant increase in their support for the democratic party。
[Speaker 1]:  furthermore，
[Speaker 1]:  there's a strong backlash from suburban voters against extreme policies，
[Speaker 1]:  creating a double wemmy。
[Speaker 1]:  this is essentially a wake up call for the entire republican party。
[Speaker 1]:  you see trump strongly endors the state legislature election。
[Speaker 1]:  actually，
[Speaker 1]:  state legislators are a relatively small matter on the national level。
[Speaker 1]:  he said it wasn't that important，
[Speaker 1]:  not that important，
[Speaker 1]:  but it serves as a bell weather，
[Speaker 1]:  but you can see that the american president，
[Speaker 1]:  essentially the most influential person in the party has to come out in campaign for a small local election in a state。
[Speaker 1]:  you can see how important this is to him in the way he worded。
[Speaker 1]:  his endorsement is also very interesting。
[Speaker 1]:  he said，
[Speaker 1]:  this lady's name is something like guss。
[Speaker 1]:  this word is very difficult to pronounce。
[Speaker 1]:  i won't pronounce it。
[Speaker 1]:  he said she's a very good candidate，
[Speaker 1]:  and she has my complete and total endorsement called CTE。
[Speaker 1]:  this city is also a specific term used by trump supporters，
[Speaker 1]:  complete and total endorsement。
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  this was posted on january thirty year，
[Speaker 1]:  urging people to go out and vote for her to vote for her，
[Speaker 1]:  and he even posted all the information about the polling locations。
[Speaker 1]:  as a result，
[Speaker 1]:  there was a thirty one point swing。
[Speaker 1]:  you see，
[Speaker 1]:  ron descentist，
[Speaker 1]:  the governor of florida，
[Speaker 1]:  said that these special elections are generally，
[Speaker 1]:  how should i put it low probability events and you can't really extraplate them to national elections？
[Speaker 1]:  after all，
[Speaker 1]:  there's a reason why they're called special elections。
[Speaker 1]:  they're held because special cirirmstances，
[Speaker 1]:  but a thirty one point swing like this is not something that can be ignored。
[Speaker 1]:  republican party members definitely need to take a look at this political atmosphere before the midterm elections，
[Speaker 1]:  you can see the difference in information here。
[Speaker 0]: 我零一零一十的一的的的的的的的的的的的的没的证据。
[Speaker 1]:  and also，
[Speaker 1]:  you know，
[Speaker 1]:  in these local elections，
[Speaker 1]:  especially small elections，
[Speaker 1]:  money is very important。
[Speaker 1]:  you need to run advertisements。
[Speaker 1]:  and since the number of voters is limited，
[Speaker 1]:  you can be very targeted aggressively running ads in that area，
[Speaker 1]:  attacking your opponent ts。
[Speaker 1]:  so this particular election，
[Speaker 1]:  even a few thousand dollars worth of advertising could swing the susuts。
[Speaker 1]:  so money is very important in this absolutely。
[Speaker 1]:  but do you know how big the gap in funding was between these two candidates？
[Speaker 1]:  the difference is my goodness。
[Speaker 1]:  twelve times，
[Speaker 2]:  the republican candidate，
[Speaker 2]:  this woman spent two point four million dollars on her campaign。
[Speaker 1]:  the democratic candidate only spent two hundred thousand dorouars and twelve to one ratio。
[Speaker 1]:  if you calculate the other later investments that is the money coming from some independent groups and independent organizations。
[Speaker 1]: 好的好的，
[Speaker 1]:  the ratio is approximately six to seven to one。
[Speaker 1]:  that is a seven to one funding ratio。
[Speaker 1]:  essentially，
[Speaker 1]:  the republican candidate had the endorsement of the president，
[Speaker 1]:  the endorsement of various important figures and seven times the funding of her opponent。
[Speaker 1]:  and yet she still lost the election。
[Speaker 0]: 对对对。
[Speaker 1]:  so you have to understand that，
[Speaker 1]:  as you said，
[Speaker 1]:  the contrast with the other candidate is actually the main reason there's nothing that can be done about it。
[Speaker 1]:  these policies are simply too unpopular。
[Speaker 1]:  you can't pursue such extreme policies。
[Speaker 1]:  sometimes it's actually like the show i did with doctor dean before in the american electoral system。
[Speaker 1]:  you have forty votes for the exderate faction，
[Speaker 1]:  thirty votes for the moderate faction one and thirty votes for the moderate faction，
[Speaker 1]:  too。
[Speaker 1]:  in this american electoral system，
[Speaker 1]:  the extreme faction，
[Speaker 1]:  one wins with forty votes，
[Speaker 1]:  giving them a kind of arrogant，
[Speaker 1]:  rational confidence，
[Speaker 1]:  making them think their extreme policies are correct，
[Speaker 1]:  and they become increasingly extreme in reality。
[Speaker 1]:  look at what happens right after irreversible consequences occur。
[Speaker 1]:  there's this kind of drastic political turmoil。
[Speaker 1]:  you should know about this woman。
[Speaker 1]:  i can briefly introduce her background。
[Speaker 1]:  this were republican candidate。
[Speaker 1]:  this female candidate was actually a news anchor。
[Speaker 1]:  if you seen her photos，
[Speaker 1]:  you'll see she's very beautiful。
[Speaker 1]:  you can tell it a glance that she's a beautiful woman，
[Speaker 1]:  very charismatic。
[Speaker 1]:  then in her early years，
[Speaker 1]:  she participated in politics，
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  as a professional campaign manager for congressional eletions tions，
[Speaker 1]:  she she ararted her own small company。
[Speaker 1]:  she lashe participated in local political activities。
[Speaker 1]:  well，
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  she's one of the founding members of the north texxrerelican womwom's club，
[Speaker 1]:  and for a long time，
[Speaker 1]:  she's been involved in in volunteer ganizing fundrazing and mobilization for various conservative individuals and candidates with her own agenda，
[Speaker 1]:  such as anti abortion，
[Speaker 1]:  anti woke education and anti gun control。
[Speaker 1]:  so you can see that she's very experienced in local political movements。
[Speaker 1]:  she's definitely not a novous when it comes to campaigning，
[Speaker 1]:  she's worher way up from the grassroots level。
[Speaker 1]:  so why did she lose in that district in texas after becoming so unpopular？
[Speaker 1]:  there's a very important reason she launched a movement targeting schools，
[Speaker 1]:  but specially public schools in texas。
[Speaker 1]:  i don't know if you know this，
[Speaker 1]:  but in texas，
[Speaker 1]:  these public school districts like the southlist school district were in a very affluent suburb of the county。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  it's a very wealthy area between twenty eighteen and twenty twenty。
[Speaker 1]:  there were several incidents where students at these schools shouted，
[Speaker 1]:  racially，
[Speaker 1]:  discriminatory words and spread racist graffiti on campus。
[Speaker 1]:  this is very unusual。
[Speaker 1]:  i should briefly explain to our readers what the south leaak district is。
[Speaker 1]:  like i've been there，
[Speaker 1]:  basically，
[Speaker 1]:  if you're from the bay area，
[Speaker 1]:  you might know places like sam，
[Speaker 1]:  a tail and foster city，
[Speaker 1]:  it's that kind of feel there are mentionons there。
[Speaker 1]:  south lake is a very wealthy area，
[Speaker 1]:  so wealthy that i，
[Speaker 1]:  as a professor，
[Speaker 1]:  couldn't afford to live there。
[Speaker 1]:  so for that kind of place to have such racist language and behavior is really outrageous。
[Speaker 1]:  the school district saw this and said，
[Speaker 1]:  we can't have children shouting these racist words every day。
[Speaker 1]:  we need to implementing action plan to improve the student handbook and provide anti discrimination training。
[Speaker 1]:  quote，
[Speaker 1]:  they then launched a five year plan。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  this woman's own children didn't attend these public schools。
[Speaker 1]:  they went to private schools，
[Speaker 1]:  yes。
[Speaker 1]:  and then well，
[Speaker 1]:  he launched a strong movement opposing what was essentially an anti racist movement，
[Speaker 1]:  framing it as a movement against white people。
[Speaker 1]:  a woke movement aimed at targeting white people。
[Speaker 1]:  he strongly opposed this movement，
[Speaker 1]:  sending emails and distributing fyers to various schools and parents。
[Speaker 1]:  these included propaganda materials disguised as fake newspapers。
[Speaker 1]:  when you open them，
[Speaker 1]:  you think they are newspapers。
[Speaker 1]:  but in reality，
[Speaker 1]:  their propaganda materials illed led sensensational and sleeing articles and headlines designed to inside fear and manipulate parents emotions。
[Speaker 1]:  at the same time，
[Speaker 1]:  he managed to push many conservative individuals onto the school board，
[Speaker 1]:  aiming to label all those who supported the current curricululumst woke liberals。
[Speaker 1]:  he declared a cultural war to completely eliminate these woke liberals。
[Speaker 1]:  what was the result of this series of actions？
[Speaker 1]:  the school's discrimination and harassment problems were not only unresolved，
[Speaker 1]:  but many extremely conservative，
[Speaker 1]:  arguably far right individuals，
[Speaker 1]:  gain control of the school districts board immediately abolishing the cultural compedency programme addressing racism。
[Speaker 1]:  this led the students and parents who experience racial comperimination filing complaints with a federal department of education。
[Speaker 1]:  the department of education then launched a civil rights investigtion into the school district。
[Speaker 1]:  this is a very serious accusation，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  the fact that these students and parents were able to take this issue all the way to the department of experience tation，
[Speaker 1]:  prompting and investigation indicates that they certainly had evidence。
[Speaker 1]:  the new schoolboard decided to adopt a very confrontational stance。
[Speaker 1]:  you want to investigate。
[Speaker 1]:  we'll fight you to the end。
[Speaker 1]:  we will become a model school district for the entire nation's right wing anti c。
[Speaker 1]:  rt movement quote，
[Speaker 1]:  this series of actions，
[Speaker 1]:  annoyed，
[Speaker 1]:  neutral or moderate parents。
[Speaker 1]:  they just wanted their children to learn and go to school properly，
[Speaker 1]:  but instead，
[Speaker 1]:  they were constantly embroiled in a cultural war。
[Speaker 1]:  you can't you can't take a break，
[Speaker 1]:  take some rest。
[Speaker 1]:  we shouldn't discriminate against others。
[Speaker 1]:  you shouldn't discriminate against another group because of race。
[Speaker 1]:  so other factors just don't let them discriminate against others，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  why do you have to stir up so much trouble？
[Speaker 1]:  it's causing so much tension。
[Speaker 1]:  and more importantly，
[Speaker 1]:  the shoudidn't in charge，
[Speaker 1]:  your child doesn't even go to this school。
[Speaker 1]:  your child is attending a different private school in doing well。
[Speaker 1]:  while our children are suffering from these inexplicable attacks every day，
[Speaker 1]:  the school is so divided interternally。
[Speaker 1]:  what's going on？
[Speaker 1]:  this is a major reason why she's so unpopular。
[Speaker 1]:  actually regarding this situation，
[Speaker 1]:  whether we are left wing or right wing chinese people。
[Speaker 1]:  there's one thing i've been saying，
[Speaker 1]:  chinese parents can run for school board positions in their local school districts。
[Speaker 1]:  these education committee members have considerable power。
[Speaker 1]:  they can determine the direction of the curriculum。
[Speaker 1]:  what content is included，
[Speaker 1]:  what is excluded and so on。
[Speaker 1]:  their power is quite significant。
[Speaker 1]:  i also shared a short story before in plaano，
[Speaker 1]:  north dallas。
[Speaker 1]:  their school actually teaches chinese，
[Speaker 1]:  some white parents called the school and ask why they didn't teach spanish。
[Speaker 1]:  the school's answer was very technical。
[Speaker 1]:  they said that spanish is too similar to english。
[Speaker 1]:  so it can't effectively develop children's intelligence like chinese。
[Speaker 1]:  after hearing this，
[Speaker 1]:  i suspected that many chinese parents in that area might have occupied the school board positions，
[Speaker 1]:  so they taught chinese and gave such a technical reason。
[Speaker 1]:  actually，
[Speaker 1]:  what they said is quite true，
[Speaker 1]:  because if you learn two languages that are too similar，
[Speaker 1]:  your child doesn't experience the charm of a completely different symbol system。
[Speaker 1]:  so i want to remind everyone whether you're left wing or right wing，
[Speaker 1]:  try to run for school board positions。
[Speaker 1]:  this is a very important grass roots positions，
[Speaker 1]:  and it doesn't require any specific qualifications running for school board is the best way to participate in politics，
[Speaker 1]:  and there aren't many requirements regarding language skills either。
[Speaker 1]:  this is just to inform everyone。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  i think you have to start from the grass roots，
[Speaker 1]:  if you want to participate in politictic movement，
[Speaker 1]:  or if you want your voice to receive more attention，
[Speaker 1]:  you have to participate in these grassroots movements，
[Speaker 1]:  especially in education。
[Speaker 1]:  because imagine if the entire district，
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  all the kids in plo，
[Speaker 1]:  regardless of their ethnicity，
[Speaker 1]:  grew up learning chinese，
[Speaker 1]:  it's almost impossible for them to have any excessively hostile actions towards chinese people，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  and this woman also initiated many other movements，
[Speaker 1]:  essentially trying to turn the entire teraron county into a testing ground for socially servative policies。
[Speaker 1]:  do you know what she's doing？
[Speaker 1]:  a large number of books are being removed from shelves and band in school libraries and classrooms in this school district。
[Speaker 1]:  what kind of books are being removed in band？
[Speaker 1]:  is it related to evolution and climate change？
[Speaker 1]:  again？
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 2]:  it's related to what the label is wwoke culture。
[Speaker 2]:  anything related to the left wing？
[Speaker 2]:  they're taking it all down。
[Speaker 2]:  then the curriculum standards and texbooks are to be rewritten，
[Speaker 2]:  weakening issues of racial and gender equality。
[Speaker 2]:  at the same time，
[Speaker 1]:  religious symbols and prayers and schools are to become more normalized blurrthe lines of separation，
[Speaker 1]:  bebetween church and state。
[Speaker 1]:  wow，
[Speaker 1]:  we need to add something here。
[Speaker 1]:  this is actually caused by the two party system in the united states。
[Speaker 1]:  if there are four or five major social issues，
[Speaker 1]:  then the number of parties should be in plus one or at least four or five parties。
[Speaker 1]:  currently，
[Speaker 1]:  there are about four or five major social issues such as cultural issues，
[Speaker 1]:  immigration issues，
[Speaker 1]:  economic issues and political issues。
[Speaker 1]:  but there are only two parties。
[Speaker 1]:  you'll find some extremely bizarre situations，
[Speaker 1]:  whether republican and democratic parties are both strange amalalgms，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  the republican party combinangle al，
[Speaker 1]:  an conservservtitisproprounrights pro life，
[Speaker 1]:  strong national security with oppositions to evolution and climate change theory。
[Speaker 1]:  do these two things even have a connection？
[Speaker 1]:  wheno no connection at all。
[Speaker 1]:  you said that wind power is acceptable and women are acceptable。
[Speaker 1]:  so why do you have to tie to opposing a specific theory，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  and then you tire to zoophobia，
[Speaker 1]:  which just seems bizarre。
[Speaker 1]:  you just said that win power is acceptable in women are acceptable，
[Speaker 1]:  but the king is not acceptable。
[Speaker 1]:  he didn't say that immigrants from other countries are not acceptable，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  this is not the content of orthododo's conservatism。
[Speaker 1]:  so we should all understand that the situation in the united states is actually an acceptable because its system design had problems more than two hundred years ago。
[Speaker 1]:  so true angle american conservatism is actually that win power is acceptable。
[Speaker 1]:  women are acceptable，
[Speaker 1]:  and the king is not acceptable。
[Speaker 1]:  then politically，
[Speaker 1]:  it's about this economically。
[Speaker 1]:  it's a free market economy。
[Speaker 1]:  basically，
[Speaker 1]:  that's it。
[Speaker 1]:  those things afterwards are a missimatsh created by the flawd design of the american system。
[Speaker 1]:  let's just briefly mention that yes，
[Speaker 1]:  dot，
[Speaker 1]:  and then he also introduced some kind of legislation regarding gender and toilets。
[Speaker 1]:  he participated in the senate hearing，
[Speaker 1]:  and he demanded standing on the most hard linside that in toilets and other such spaces，
[Speaker 1]:  the lines must be drawn strictly according to the gender assign at birth。
[Speaker 1]:  he also demanded that the ten commandments be posted in every classroom in texes，
[Speaker 1]:  which to some suburban parents makes him seem quite ill。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  he's a little crazy，
[Speaker 1]:  bringing back the separation of church and state issue。
[Speaker 1]:  how long has it been since the separation of church and state was established？
[Speaker 1]:  you want to bring this back into schools。
[Speaker 1]:  are you out of your mind？
[Speaker 1]:  you can think about how the so called free world criticize the islamic world back then right now，
[Speaker 2]:  you want to bring this back to a christian country。
[Speaker 2]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  this is wrong。
[Speaker 1]:  the separation of church and state is the foundation of a modern state。
[Speaker 1]:  this cannot be done。
[Speaker 1]:  let's be honest。
[Speaker 1]:  so his whole strategy was to appeal to many suburban voters who aren't necessarily democratic supporters。
[Speaker 1]:  many of them are moderate republican voters。
[Speaker 1]:  when they saw this situation，
[Speaker 1]:  they couldn't stand it。
[Speaker 1]:  they thought，
[Speaker 1]:  if we elected this woman e'll just turned the state senate into another battlefield for culture wars。
[Speaker 1]:  quote，
[Speaker 1]:  look at the cards or opponent played，
[Speaker 1]:  we need to support the working class。
[Speaker 1]:  we need to support unions。
[Speaker 1]:  we need to increase investment in public education and lower the cost of living。
[Speaker 1]:  quote，
[Speaker 0]:  hello，
[Speaker 1]:  you deliberately downplay the culture war issue，
[Speaker 1]:  basically not mentioning it all。
[Speaker 1]:  so you see these two different campaign strategies resulted in a thirty one point lead。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  that's right。
[Speaker 1]:  the fundamental problem is the economy，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  you can see why this district voted for trump in twenty twenty four。
[Speaker 1]:  it's actually very simple。
[Speaker 1]:  this district has many voters who support populist ideas。
[Speaker 1]:  trump followed a popust line，
[Speaker 1]:  populust voters supported trump。
[Speaker 1]:  so why did they suddenly vote for a democrat in twenty twenty six？
[Speaker 1]:  this is also easy to understand many people in new yorork voted for for trumpin。
[Speaker 1]:  the primary later voted for zor and mandck。
[Speaker 2]:  you can see that the left and right wings in terms of their populist approaches，
[Speaker 2]:  if voters are sufficiently clear minded，
[Speaker 2]:  they will see who truly wants to implement real populist economics。
[Speaker 1]:  this is understandable。
[Speaker 1]:  and in twenty sixteen，
[Speaker 1]:  many bernie sandarers voters later voted for trump。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  they voted for bernie sanders in the primary，
[Speaker 1]:  but then voted for trump in the general election。
[Speaker 1]:  this shows that the populist approaches of the two factions share many similar ideas or slogans。
[Speaker 1]:  this is，
[Speaker 1]:  of course，
[Speaker 1]:  an indication that the american system is flawed。
[Speaker 1]:  if there were a third party，
[Speaker 1]:  specifically representing these disenfranchised workers，
[Speaker 1]:  things would be better right now。
[Speaker 1]:  you're basically forced to choose between chocolate flavred and shit flavred chocolate，
[Speaker 1]:  which one would you choose？
[Speaker 1]:  okay？
[Speaker 1]:  and then you need to know that if we're only talking about a special election，
[Speaker 1]:  that's a very low probability，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  a special election。
[Speaker 1]:  first of all，
[Speaker 1]:  it's a special election，
[Speaker 1]:  which means the process is different from a regular election。
[Speaker 1]:  there must be some special event。
[Speaker 1]:  but if you look at the statistics since trump enter the white house，
[Speaker 1]:  these special elections that have occurred，
[Speaker 1]:  right，
[Speaker 1]:  the special elections in various states and the federal special elections，
[Speaker 1]:  you will find that the democrats have a twelve point advantage compared to harrst performance in twenty twenty four。
[Speaker 1]:  that is to say，
[Speaker 1]:  their performance in the same areas is twelve points higher than harrst voting results that year。
[Speaker 1]:  okay。
[Speaker 1]:  so this actually tells you a very obvious change。
[Speaker 1]:  it tells you that this is a strong indicator of the midterm elections。
[Speaker 1]:  you know how people say the golden globes are an indicator of the oscars，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  well，
[Speaker 1]:  if you look at the average performance advantage in these special elections，
[Speaker 1]:  generally speaking in the past，
[Speaker 1]:  cence around two thousand and five，
[Speaker 1]:  there have been five instances where the party that performed well in the special elections，
[Speaker 1]:  ultimately，
[Speaker 1]:  one the mid term elections。
[Speaker 1]:  so this is the current trend regarding the mid term elections。
[Speaker 1]:  i mainly wanted to talk about taxes。
[Speaker 1]:  but after that，
[Speaker 1]:  let's talk about your topic love you。
[Speaker 1]:  i'll just have a drink。
