The final episode of Attack on Titan hits the big screen
This time, the super crooked will be analyzed in three episodes.
The long-awaited "Attack on Titan"
The story of "Giant" depicts the people who have enjoyed a century of peace within the city walls.
Suddenly attacked by a giant
The protagonist Eren's mother was eaten by a giant
The protagonists who lost their homes decided to train and join the Survey Corps
<font color=#F5FF00FF>I will exterminate all the giants without leaving a single one alive</font>
To fight giants, you must understand what giants are
This is the core theme that has been explored in the first three seasons of "Attack on Titan"
<font color=#F5FF00FF>The only principle of action of the giant is to eat people</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>Giants can survive for 100 years without humans</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>From this point of view</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>We speculate that the giants themselves do not need to consume food</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>In other words</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>We speculate that its purpose is not predation, but killing</font>
The giants are not trying to fill their stomachs, but simply want to eat people.
Like a puppet controlled by the mouth
Here
We see what the psychoanalyst Lacan calls the oral drive
When a baby sucks on a pacifier, there is no milk in the pacifier
Why do babies suck?
Because the act of sucking itself brings satisfaction
Just like people sometimes eat not because they are hungry
But I feel greedy
The mouth wants something in it
This oral drive is not part of human free will
Even if one's will resists the mouth, it will still have this driving force
The same giants who eat people have no self-awareness or malice
It's like a baby seeing a pacifier and putting it in his mouth.
The pure giant is actually a being deprived of free will and only has the driving force left.
But as the plot develops
The story reveals that there is more than just the Pure Titans.
Eren activated the power of the giant by accident
This adds another mystery to the story.
Why did humans become giants?
Mikasa's testimony provides us with a clue
<font color=#F5FF00FF>That scene...</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>Looks like a display of human anger</font>
Here, the giants demonstrate the ancient Greeks' concept of justice.
Plato believed that when war breaks out
The reason why the guards have the courage to defend the city-state
It's because their inner anger is aroused.
Just like a police dog will suddenly bite when it sees a bad guy
The guards' anger brings justice to the city-state community
For example, Achilles avenged his friend Patroclus.
The corpses of the enemies were dragged through the streets on horse-drawn carts.
Seen as a display of heroism
The ancient Greeks believed
This anger has a certain power connected to divinity.
The body of the enraged warrior is like a container
Can be instantly infused with God's power
As if everyone is angry
So rather than saying that human nature has anger
It is better to say that anger has human nature
I was able to witness this scene that made both humans and gods angry.
It's a great honor
Almost like seeing a god
<font color=#F5FF00FF>The giant who is feared by Mare and the whole world and is called the devil</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>In my opinion, it is another existence</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>That is God</font>
In Attack on Titan
The giant is a being that is close to being like a god.
Anger is the bridge to God.
But this view of justice immediately raises a question
Equating anger with heroism
Wouldn't that be a glorification of violence?
How do we distinguish between justifiable anger?
What kind of anger is unjustified?
Philosopher Fromm believes that
We can divide human aggression into benign and malignant
There are two different psychological dynamics behind
Benign aggression is based on the tendency to love life
For example, when living space is deprived
I had to defend myself to stay alive.
Like Armin to maintain peace
Mikasa protects Eren
And Captain Irwin leads the soldiers to the front line
Essentially, they serve life.
So it's benign
But people also have a vicious aggressive nature
It is not based on the principle of loving life.
It destroys life
Desire for non-life, death, destruction
Fromm called this necrophilia.
People with necrophilia always expect others to have their lives go wrong.
Always love to cause trouble
This kind of person has problems in life
Will not try to find solutions other than destruction and violence
Like the malicious oppression of the Eldians by the Marley people
Eren's indiscriminate attack when he was possessed by the Titan's will
And finally, the rumbling of the earth will destroy 80% of the population on earth.
These are life destroying.
Rather than serving life
The opposite of this necrophilia
It is an injection that can bring people back to life.
It is because the destructive power of the giant is too difficult to control
Eren after his first transformation
This caused panic within the wall.
Suspicious about Eren's motives
Trying to destroy this overpowering Titan force
Because this power could in turn destroy the city-state
So in Plato's Republic
The country's primary goal
Is to teach the guards to learn to control their power
<font color=#F5FF00FF>If you want to save Mikasa and Armin</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>And everyone's words</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>You must learn to control this power</font>
Just like a police dog must have an owner who controls it
Eren must also learn to let reason control himself.
True freedom is to control your own aggression
Follow the Survey Corps' orders
To serve the community
Eren couldn't control the Titans at first.
Instead, he was controlled by the power of the giant and hurt his own people.
Until Armin reawakened Eren's self-awareness that was suppressed by the Titans.
Eren's will finally awakens
<font color=#F5FF00FF>But why does Eren still want to go to the outside world? </font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>You ask why? </font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>Is there any need to ask this? </font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>That's because I was born into this world</font>
The enraged Eren finally learned how to control the power of the Titan with his will.
The moment when the big stone was lifted
He seemed to have transformed into Atlas, the Titan god of ancient Greece.
Carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders
It symbolizes that his duty is to take back the world that was taken away by the giants.
<font color=#F5FF00FF>Humanity defeated the giants for the first time today</font>
But to defeat the giant
You can't just master the power of the giant
You must also master the knowledge of giants
<font color=#F5FF00FF>What we see and what actually exists</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>Will the essence be completely different? </font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>For decades we have been trying to fight giants with hatred</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>I want to look at giants from a perspective other than existing concepts</font>
During a survey, Hanji discovered that the giants were unusually light.
This means that there is an essential world behind the phenomenal world.
The Giants Are Not What They Seem
Just some kind of man-eating monster
Hanji therefore conducted experiments on the Titans
It was discovered that the giants were active only during the day.
This knowledge itself contributes to the liberation of mankind
In order to prevent the Survey Corps from obtaining more knowledge about the Titans
Annie killed the giant's experimental specimen
We can find that every time the Survey Corps makes progress
It's all because we see through the essence behind the phenomenon.
Because of the power of knowledge
Rather than just relying on the power of giants
Hanji discovered the reason why Eren couldn't transform
Because the giantization must have a clear purpose
After studying the fragments of the city wall
Found that it is the same as the crystallized tissue of the giant
It is speculated that Eren can use his crystallization ability to fill the gap in the wall.
Captain Erwin's experience of transforming from Eren to a Titan
Rethinking past false assumptions
Rethinking the Nature of Giants
Since humans can also become giants
Then the giant who broke the wall might also be a human being.
Therefore, an operation was planned to capture the giant who was undercover in the wall alive.
Armin was able to successfully implement the battle plan
It is also because he saw through the nature of the Colossal Titan.
Confirm that the opponent is not suited to a war of attrition
Erwin, Hange, Armin
All three are good at seeing through the essence behind the phenomenon
It embodies what philosopher Roy Bhaskar calls the "dialectic of freedom and knowledge"
New knowledge will remind people to realize their own lack of freedom
Armin's stolen book "Outer Worlds"
Drives Eren to desire the unknown world outside the wall
I don't want to live in ignorance behind the wall all my life.
<font color=#F5FF00FF>Until I heard what you said</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>It was the first time I realized that I was not free</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>My freedom was taken away by those inexplicable guys</font>
But freedom is more than just the accumulation of knowledge
We must also clarify the wrong ideas
Because wrong ideas will bind people
No matter how much experience and knowledge you have accumulated
It will only reinforce the original misconception.
The people of the City Wall Cult clearly know the secret of the city wall
But deliberately concealing the correct concept
Attributing the suffering of mankind oppressed by giants to punishment from God
So the invasion of the giants actually strengthened the faith of the believers.
Make more believers of the City Wall Cult
Ordinary people have become slaves to wrong ideas
It is impossible to properly eliminate the root cause of suffering.
The only way to correctly explain what a giant is is to
What is it that binds humans?
Only then can human beings obtain true freedom
This is exactly the path that Erwin, Hange, and Armin are pursuing.
<font color=#FFF300FF>How did you come to the conclusion that there are no humans outside the wall? </font>
Willing to challenge existing knowledge frameworks
And people who make bold assumptions
Leading mankind to liberation
But in the battle against the female giant and the battle to retake Wall Maria
We see
Even with knowledge and giant strength
Still can't defeat the enemy
You must be willing to sacrifice everything.
<font color=#F5FF00FF>If a person cannot give up something, he cannot change the status quo</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>If you want to be superior to monsters</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>Then even human nature must be abandoned</font>
Armin's words reveal the world view behind the giant
We must abandon our humanity
To fight against the inhuman existence
Because the world inside the wall
It's essentially a world where the strong prey on the weak.
<font color=#F5FF00FF>This world has been hell since the beginning</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>The strong prey on the weak, a world that is simple and easy to understand</font>
The relationship between giants and humans
Similar to the relationship between humans and livestock
Livestock can live peacefully
But one day they will be eaten by humans.
If the people inside the wall don't fight back
One day, I will be eaten by a giant.
The only way for the weak to survive
Just make yourself stronger
Make yourself like a monster or a demon
If you win the battle, you can survive.
This echoes the lyrics of the theme song of Giant
<font color=#F5FF00FF>🎵 Are you food? No, we are hunters 🎵</font>
In Squid Game
We also see the same survival rules
Only the final winner can survive
Even if I have to do something inhumane
At all costs
<font color=#F5FF00FF>This is hell, there are no rules in hell</font>
Giant and Squidward
All of these reflect a certain sense of despair among contemporary people.
Psychologist Paul Verhaeghe pointed out
Contemporary capitalist society overemphasizes competition
It has become like the social Darwinism that was popular in the 19th century.
Emphasize that the survival of the fittest and the survival of the fittest are the laws of nature
The weak should be eliminated by society
Only in this way can we leave a strong gene pool for society
But if survival of the fittest is really the law of nature
Why do the Survey Corps feel pain after abandoning their humanity?
<font color=#F5FF00FF>The person I killed must have been a gentle person, right? </font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>is a person with more humanity than me</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>But I pulled the trigger immediately</font>
If survival of the fittest is really the law of nature
Why are some people willing to sacrifice themselves to help others?
<font color=#F5FF00FF>You run forward along this road</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>No need to worry about your own weakness</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>There will definitely be someone to lend a helping hand</font>
Here
"Attack on Titan" shows us another possibility of turning ourselves into monsters
Mutual Aid
Sasha returns to the village to save Kaya, a girl who was nearly eaten by a giant
This will of mutual assistance is passed on
Let Kaya help Gabi again
Kropotkin, a philosopher who opposed social Darwinism, found that
Survival of the fittest is not the only law of nature
In fact, mutual assistance also exists in the animal world.
Like a crab that can't turn over
Other members will help it turn over.
Rather than letting it die
Let its genes be eliminated
This phenomenon of mutual assistance that transcends the law of competition
Also appears in the human world
Helping the vulnerable
Rather than letting the weak be eliminated
But the brilliance of "Giant" lies in
The story is finally revealed
The so-called hell
It was actually created by humans themselves.
It was the Marleyans who turned the Eldians into giants
Let them kill each other
<font color=#F5FF00FF>Why do you do this? </font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>Do you want to see giants eat humans? </font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>That's of course because...</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>This is very interesting</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>People just like to see cruel scenes</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>Although peace is good, I always feel like something is missing</font>
So the two positions of survival of the fittest and mutual assistance among the weak
Ignoring the real key
This world looks like hell
It's man-made.
Actually, it doesn't have to be like this
In this way
The real question then becomes
How to change this world that has been turned into hell?
Dare to challenge those who make the world a hell
But at the beginning, Eren
But they deny that these people are the creators of hell.
Even though I saw the female giant's fighting skills
Still denies that Annie is a female giant
Even though all the evidence points to Reiner and Bertolt
Still denying that they are giants who destroyed the city walls
I don't believe that the good people I once thought of could also be bad people
On Eren
We see what psychoanalyst Klein called the "paranoid-schizoid position"
Klein believes
When the child's self is not yet fully developed
Splits the caregiver into different parts to understand
When desire is satisfied
I think there is a good object loving me.
When you are dissatisfied
I think there is a bad object that is persecuting me.
I want to attack and destroy it.
So many children have fantasies of wanting to dismember and eat their parents.
But people will gradually realize
The good and bad objects are actually the same person
<font color=#F5FF00FF>Dad...</font>
The one you love
The one you once attacked.
<font color=#F5FF00FF>I want to kill Mikasa? Is it really me? </font>
The so-called growing up
is the ability to integrate good objects with bad objects.
Recognize that the good object I love also has bad parts
And the bad object I attacked also had good parts
This is what Eren and the Survey Corps were forced to learn
I thought the giants were bad guys destroying the city walls.
Later I found
It turns out that giants are also good objects that protect humans.
Originally, they had been destroying the giants under the banner of protecting humanity.
But in the end I found
Giants who are considered bad objects by humans
In fact, they are the good objects (humans) that the Survey Corps has been protecting.
on the other hand
Reiner also experienced the same split psychological position
Originally, the Eldians were considered the descendants of demons.
A pure bad object
But after five years of living inside the wall
But I realized the good side of the Eldians
This split between good and bad objects
This eventually led to Reiner's mental breakdown
<font color=#F5FF00FF>If I didn't know you guys existed from the beginning</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>I won't</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>Becoming this kind of idiot who gave up halfway</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>I no longer know what is right and what is wrong</font>
Klein believes
People who can integrate good and bad objects
Feel a new emotion
Guilt
To overcome this guilt
People will want to repair the damage they have done
But to be able to repair
You must have enough strength first
<font color=#F5FF00FF>I want to control the giants to block Wall Maria</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>Then catch Reiner and the others and make them pay the price</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>This is my atonement</font>
The process of a child becoming an adult
It's actually to overcome the guilt.
To gain strength to repair
In the process
Brought new creativity to human society
The original destroyer
Became a creator
final
I not only fixed myself
It also repaired the entire human community.
Let this hellish world be repaired
Take back the freedom taken away by the giants
etc.
What is freedom?
In Attack on Titan
We found that most people
Whether inside or outside the wall
They are all trapped in a kind of unfreedom
Annie, Reiner, and Bertolt, who were born in Marley society
I was taught from childhood to cleanse the sins of the Eldians.
Being forced to do things you don't want to do
Sacrificing freedom to shoulder the historical karma
<font color=#F5FF00FF>Who ​​would want to do this?</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>But we can't bear this sin</font>
Christa is a royal descendant
Carrying the family's karma since childhood
For self-protection
Must hide one's true identity
You must also accept your family's plan to inherit the power of the Titans.
Loss of freedom to plan your own life
<font color=#F5FF00FF>That is my...mission</font>
Ymir deceived himself and everyone else during his lifetime.
Pretend to be a royal descendant
Eventually he was punished by the Marley people and turned into a giant
Loss of freedom as a human being
<font color=#F5FF00FF>This is probably the punishment</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>It is not a punishment for being instigated to deceive others</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>It's because I deceived myself into thinking I could help others</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>The punishment for constantly lying to yourself</font>
National Education
Family Arrangements
Society's expectations
These external meanings are imposed on people.
Make oneself an other
I'm not myself anymore
Philosopher Heidegger called this the "normal state of the world" (Das Man).
People who fall into the state of ordinary people
You only need the country, family and society to help you make choices
Instead of having to choose
Just escape to the world arranged by everyone to keep warm
To gain a sense of security
But this normal state
It is actually an escape from freedom
It prevents me from truly knowing myself and being myself.
Eren refuses this normal state
Most people think that hiding behind the wall is comfortable
It's just a false peace
Eager to go out and discover the truth of the world
Rather than sinking with the people inside the wall
Refuse to blame your current situation for your lack of freedom in life
<font color=#F5FF00FF>We are all born free</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>It has nothing to do with how powerful the person who is blocking us is</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>Let's fight</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>For freedom, I will sacrifice my whole life</font>
Eren's words reveal the core of Heidegger's philosophy
Human beings are essentially Being-in-the-world
We are all born into a country, family, or social community.
Many things are decided before we are born.
We can't change
But no matter how great these practical obstacles are,
It's not a reason to escape freedom.
Instead, it is a starting point
Let me know how to choose the different possibilities
I can choose to resist the demands of the state, the orders of my family, the expectations of society.
Let the future have different possibilities beyond the current situation
This proves that I am not a determined being.
It is a self-determined existence
This is called freedom
No matter how powerful the ruler is
We all have the freedom to resist a broken system
Change together with all those who desire to surpass
Choose a plan to overturn the status quo
No longer a slave to the ruler
<font color=#F5FF00FF>It is everyone's choice that changes the world together</font>
Freedom is the freedom of man in this limited and always determined world.
Still choose to realize your plan
Let yourself transcend the original state of being determined
This is the most fundamental difference between humans and giants.
Giants are beings without independent consciousness and are determined by others.
Just like people in normal state
Ymir before being punished and turned into a giant
He is a person who lives in an ordinary state and deceives himself.
After becoming a giant, I realized how it felt to be deprived of freedom.
Until Ymir becomes human again
"Being a person" takes on a whole new meaning
<font color=#F5FF00FF>When I opened my eyes again</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>What appears before my eyes is infinite freedom</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>That day I swore to myself</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>I will never lie to myself again</font>
<font color=#F5FF00FF>I must live honestly</font>
Ymir reveals the essence of freedom
Freedom is not something that can be owned like property.
Rather, the universe gives "human beings" the opportunity to express their freedom.
The universe doesn't have to do this.
Only when humans are transformed into non-humans will they realize
It turns out that being human means having unlimited freedom.
Heidegger believes
Freedom is something that has long been forgotten by mankind
Freedom is not a condition of being human
Human existence is the condition for freedom
To be born as a human being
Rather than an animal, plant, giant
It is a gift of freedom
You can make your own choices
Reject the status set for me by others
But if one escapes from this freedom
Escape to the normal state
They simply forget the gift of being human.
Make yourself like a giant who has lost his self-awareness
In this way
Attack on Titan is actually everyone’s story
Everyone may be convinced by the history they believe in
To do something that is beyond your control
Everyone may seek self-protection
To hide the real self
Everyone may also want to meet the expectations of others
Live your whole life for others
But if I could start over again
Human beings still have the opportunity to live like a free person
<font color=#ECFF00FF>When I reveal this secret</font>
<font color=#ECFF00FF>Promise me</font>
<font color=#ECFF00FF>You have to live with your original name</font>
Ymir's words
Just like Isayama Hajime confessed to the audience:
When I reveal the secrets of the giant's story
You have to live your true self.
The story of the giant thus becomes a memory machine
Reminds us of the freedom that humans themselves have forgotten
Still hidden in everyone's life
Still hidden in everyone's life
