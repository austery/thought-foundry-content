[Speaker 1]:  hello，
[Speaker 1]:  everyone，
[Speaker 1]:  sunday，
[Speaker 1]:  february first，
[Speaker 1]:  twenty twenty six，
[Speaker 1]:  welcome to episode ten thirteen of world news。
[Speaker 1]:  please allow me to introduce the topic at the end of last year。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey announce that it would implement a vissafe free entry policy for chinese citizens starting in twenty twenty six。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey has abundant tourism resources and is the second natal member to implement a visa free policy for ordinary chinese citizens？
[Speaker 0]: 嗯，
[Speaker 1]:  is it risky to travel to turkey now from last year to now，
[Speaker 1]:  it may have been the best year for turkey in terms ms。
[Speaker 1]:  its externnal environment since its independence，
[Speaker 1]:  whether in geopolitics or suppressing domstic separatist forces，
[Speaker 1]:  the erdowan government has achieved results。
[Speaker 1]:  at the same time，
[Speaker 1]:  turkey has not yet born too many burdens，
[Speaker 1]:  and its economic problems have eased somewhat currently。
[Speaker 1]:  it is indeed a good time to travel to turkey regarding neighbing syria regarding is twenty nineteen，
[Speaker 1]:  taking advantage of the syrian civil war。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey launch operation peace spring directly controlling four thousand square kilometres terteritorory in northern syria。
[Speaker 1]:  subsequently，
[Speaker 1]:  turkey continued to port opposition arm groups to attack the syrian government and overthrough the ausosod regime。
[Speaker 1]:  at that time，
[Speaker 1]:  the osod regime was russia's agent in the middle east and thought it gained ined chinese support。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey didn't get much in return，
[Speaker 1]:  but russia，
[Speaker 1]:  in twenty twenty two recklessly invaded ukraine game，
[Speaker 1]:  bogged down in a protracted war，
[Speaker 1]:  and even lost its maritime control in the black sea，
[Speaker 1]:  losing the ability to project power into the mediteranian。
[Speaker 1]:  it proved that once deprived of imperialist support，
[Speaker 1]:  the osod regime didn't even have the ability to fight back at the end of twenty twenty four。
[Speaker 1]:  the syrian opposition forces only took twelve days to capture almost all important cikana，
[Speaker 1]:  and then controlled the capital damascus with asside himself fleeing to russia，
[Speaker 1]:  the largest force among the opposition group，
[Speaker 1]:  has called the syrian liberation organzation，
[Speaker 1]:  which has always been a key target of turkish support。
[Speaker 1]:  in addition to providing funds and weapons，
[Speaker 1]:  turkey also also sent military advisto to help with command at the end of twenty twenty four。
[Speaker 1]:  before runia，
[Speaker 1]:  the leader of the syrian liberation organization announced this presidency，
[Speaker 1]:  turkey had already sent its foreignister proviproviironnial with international recognition。
[Speaker 1]:  two months later，
[Speaker 1]:  jone announced this presidency and immediately visited turkeys to meet with aerwon，
[Speaker 1]:  declaring that the two countries would cooperate closely，
[Speaker 1]:  although jelanne。
[Speaker 1]:  now holds the title of cident。
[Speaker 1]:  his regime is unstable in the eastern south。
[Speaker 1]:  there are separative regimes established by curds and dreruws people，
[Speaker 1]:  respectively，
[Speaker 1]:  the opposition forces that helped him seize power have now become warlords ds，
[Speaker 1]:  each with their own foreign acacking for joanany's regime to survive。
[Speaker 1]:  it must cooperate with turkey's international strategy in the long term。
[Speaker 1]:  after transforming syria into a client state，
[Speaker 1]:  air wan focused on resolving the curdish issusuthe，
[Speaker 1]:  the curare are amounting people living in the border region of turkey，
[Speaker 1]:  syria，
[Speaker 1]:  iroq and iran。
[Speaker 1]:  originally，
[Speaker 1]:  they didn't have a strong sense of national identity，
[Speaker 1]:  but is surrounding country's form nation states。
[Speaker 1]:  the curds also demanded their own state，
[Speaker 1]:  especially the curds in turkey who were forced into seeking independence by turkey's brutal policies，
[Speaker 1]:  starting in nineteen ninety，
[Speaker 1]:  ty four in organization called the kurdistand workers party PKK launched in arm rebellion，
[Speaker 1]:  carrying out numerous terrorist attacks within turkey。
[Speaker 1]:  one reason turkey wanted to control syria was to suppress the PKK forces in nineteen ninety nine。
[Speaker 1]:  turkish agents arrested of dollooklen，
[Speaker 1]:  the PKK leader with the situation arrest the oklaland arrest the the KK ase arm forces，
[Speaker 1]:  mainly enaged in gorilla warfare in the mountains against the turkish army。
[Speaker 1]:  after okkl's arrest，
[Speaker 1]:  the PKK，
[Speaker 1]:  they shifted its target to major turkish cities，
[Speaker 1]:  frequently carrying obamb attacks by twenty twenty five。
[Speaker 1]:  the conflict between turkey and the PKK had come to an end in feblary of the previous year okllen，
[Speaker 1]:  who been in prison for a long time。
[Speaker 1]:  isised a statement demanding ding，
[Speaker 1]:  all armed personnel lid down their weapons and despend the PKK in march，
[Speaker 1]:  the PKK leadership surprisingly announce the ceasefire stained that they would sponsponto okkin's demands by october。
[Speaker 1]:  the PKK had withdrawn all its armed forces from turtury y resolving the domestic problem。
[Speaker 1]:  the next target was the condition arm forces in syria。
[Speaker 1]:  in the past few weeks，
[Speaker 1]:  the current syrian government forces and the turks have jointly launched another air and ground，
[Speaker 1]:  coordinated offensive，
[Speaker 1]:  seizing all the urban strstrholds in a small number of wheelfields from the syrian curds，
[Speaker 1]:  the kurdish problem in turkey made thus escally。
[Speaker 1]:  it was mentioned earlier that turkey was able to control syria，
[Speaker 1]:  even russia's aggresve ve vvasiof uuraraforforce it to strategically withdraw in all other areas，
[Speaker 1]:  thus creating a power vacuum。
[Speaker 1]:  initially turkey actively supported ukraine even earlier than the EU in the US。
[Speaker 1]:  during rushes attacks on kevin carchive，
[Speaker 1]:  the TB two drones used by ukraine to attack russian logistics facilities were turkisish in the pmber mber twenty twenty uuraine ine presidents ollinki personally awarded military medals to the TB two manufacturers thanking them for their contributions to ukraine's sistance stance inst st。
[Speaker 1]:  invasion。
[Speaker 1]:  even now，
[Speaker 1]:  although russia's anti drone technology has improved considerably and the TB tools combat capabilities are not as crucials before uuraine ine mains，
[Speaker 1]:  a major user of turkish drones，
[Speaker 1]:  besides drones，
[Speaker 1]:  the armred vehicles and rapid depointment bombused by ukraine in the early stages of the war were also supplied by turkey。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey provided both financial and material assistance to help ukraine sesetle refugees。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  since last year year rurua's offensive capabilities have steadily declined。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey ine attituwards，
[Speaker 1]:  the russia ukraine war has changed，
[Speaker 1]:  although historally turkey in russia have always been old rivals，
[Speaker 1]:  airdowine understands that russia shouldn't be too strong，
[Speaker 1]:  but also not to weak if the russia ukraine war destroys russia strength，
[Speaker 1]:  turkey will loan important bargaining ship and will also lose significant strategic value in its dealings with the US and the EU considering that turkey has already resolved，
[Speaker 1]:  the syrian problem continuing to weak russia is clearly not in its best interest。
[Speaker 1]:  on the other hand，
[Speaker 1]:  before the russia ukraine war began，
[Speaker 1]:  adowon and pudn had a relatively good personal relationship in two thousand。
[Speaker 1]:  sixsixteen cw attempt was launch by the turkish military，
[Speaker 1]:  but it was suppressed by the airdoone government。
[Speaker 1]:  the following there were rumors at the time that it was intelligence。
[Speaker 1]:  promply provided by the put tting government that allowed aerwon to evacuate the presidentipalalinan time and avoid being overthrown by the military。
[Speaker 1]:  a more direct factor that change aergg's attitude was that the war between russia and ukraine was affecting turkey，
[Speaker 1]:  starting in twenty twenty five。
[Speaker 1]:  ukraine intensified its attacks on russies enererindustry，
[Speaker 1]:  with one target being black sea shipping in november last year，
[Speaker 1]:  two ships near the turkish coastline exploded in caught fire。
[Speaker 1]:  the turkish ministry of foreigfairs quickly issued a statement emphasizing that the attack occurred in turkyh blacksey exclusive economic zone and affected local maritime safety on december twelth。
[Speaker 1]:  during russies bombing of ukrainian black seapports。
[Speaker 1]:  another turkish containership was damaged，
[Speaker 1]:  while two ships being damaged wasn't enough to make turkey over in nervous。
[Speaker 1]:  key's real concern with its own energy supply，
[Speaker 1]:  specifically the turkish natural gas pipeline in twenty twenty twenty four。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey exported sixteen point seven bilrocubic meters of natural gas europe through this pipeline，
[Speaker 1]:  with eight point six billion going to pipeline。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey itself is highly dependent on this pipeline，
[Speaker 1]:  importing twenty one billion cubic meters in the same year，
[Speaker 1]:  four point three billion more than europe。
[Speaker 1]:  in february last year，
[Speaker 1]:  a ukrainian drown attacked craasmadar in russia，
[Speaker 1]:  which is also the starting point of the tury pipeline，
[Speaker 1]:  nearly damaging it。
[Speaker 1]:  furthermore，
[Speaker 1]:  turkeys in energy deficient country，
[Speaker 1]:  relying on imports for two thirds of its energy。
[Speaker 1]:  therefore，
[Speaker 1]:  turkey is more afraid of incident similar to the north stream pipeline explosion than europe。
[Speaker 1]:  so it hopes that russia and ukraine can reduce the intensity of the world。
[Speaker 1]:  starting in may，
[Speaker 1]:  representatives from russia and ukraine held three rounds of talks in uraanable。
[Speaker 1]:  although there were no significant results，
[Speaker 1]:  it also shows that turkey is not content with being nearly a wife of the world's powerful nations，
[Speaker 1]:  and it's beginning to test the water to sit the table。
[Speaker 1]:  besides its neighborcountries。
[Speaker 1]:  es key has not forgotten to expand its influence in the traditional islamic world since gdophice fall。
[Speaker 1]:  liyyhas has AA tively been divided into two regimes。
[Speaker 1]:  one religisly oriented controlling the capital and western support cities back by turkey and nown ce，
[Speaker 1]:  the tripoli，
[Speaker 1]:  one back more secular，
[Speaker 1]:  one back by russia，
[Speaker 1]:  egypt and the UA，
[Speaker 1]:  controlling eastern libyan territory，
[Speaker 1]:  and also known as the national army，
[Speaker 1]:  starting in twenty twenty turkey，
[Speaker 1]:  directly deployed troops to tripoli to help the tripoli government fight against the national army。
[Speaker 1]:  russia also deployed troops to support the national army，
[Speaker 1]:  creating a stalmate with the tripoli government in exchange。
[Speaker 1]:  the key gain influence in the eastern meditranean and established military basis in libya。
[Speaker 1]:  historically，
[Speaker 1]:  the autommemploe e loose governed libyan territory，
[Speaker 1]:  but now eardigans influence over libya may even exceed that of the former autumn soultans issue one hundred twenty six six，
[Speaker 1]:  the one hundred twenty twenty world news covered the libyan conflict。
[Speaker 1]:  and at the time，
[Speaker 1]:  i said that russia and turkey would likely maintain the division of libya while simultaneously engaging in conflict。
[Speaker 1]:  in the past few years，
[Speaker 1]:  libya has deep remained divided，
[Speaker 1]:  and no one has been able to resolve the situation starting last year，
[Speaker 1]:  perhaps believing that russia left the capacity to further intervene in the mediterranian。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey began engaging with the national army regime，
[Speaker 1]:  hoping to gain more benefits through peaceful means。
[Speaker 1]:  episode one thousand disdisssed，
[Speaker 1]:  how the sitation in the interinterfued in another small small african country，
[Speaker 1]:  somalia，
[Speaker 1]:  a tury y long eeablilied，
[Speaker 1]:  the navval ase，
[Speaker 1]:  ase and army training centre in somalia on the last day of the year airdowanannounced，
[Speaker 1]:  an investment of six billion dollars to build a training centre in somalia，
[Speaker 1]:  compensating for the limitations of turkey's g graphic location and fulfilling the ambition of expanding into the red sea region。
[Speaker 1]:  reminism of the automaate ammpres has historical expansion along the african coast。
[Speaker 1]:  now turkey has penetrated deep into england africa。
[Speaker 1]:  turketly confronting the graagnant group。
[Speaker 1]:  in the past few years。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey has established thirty seven military offices in africa and sold weapons and equipment to twenty four countries，
[Speaker 1]:  canyon yogan and nugerian troops are all receiving turkish training and have opened military bases to turkey。
[Speaker 1]:  besides russia。
[Speaker 1]:  iran is also a historical adversary of turkey during the syrian war。
[Speaker 1]:  iran in turkey fought a proxy war。
[Speaker 1]:  these past two years have been difficult for an and elderone has more than just jodden in froda。
[Speaker 1]:  he has deeper considerations。
[Speaker 1]:  if urrn continues，
[Speaker 1]:  dedescend in the ooand，
[Speaker 1]:  turkey might actually suffered the consequences。
[Speaker 1]:  since the beginning of the new year，
[Speaker 1]:  iran has been interturmoil offofficiacknowledged death toll has exceeded three thousand with the most intense protest sts ccurring in the kurdish populated areas of the northwest tribal militias have already merge there even during the height of the autumn empires power。
[Speaker 1]:  it never crossed the massipatanian region to control the iranian plado edewon clearly understands that he cannot sees iraniterritory。
[Speaker 1]:  so so well on，
[Speaker 1]:  shouldn't be too strong。
[Speaker 1]:  it's also best that it doesn't deceend to complete chaos and disintegration，
[Speaker 1]:  preventing the curcurds from getting large swals of land on january twelth。
[Speaker 1]:  the turkey spokesperson publicly stated that the iranian issue should be resolved by the iranian government，
[Speaker 1]:  and that they do not want to see any chaos in irong besides direct territal expansion in military basis。
[Speaker 1]:  turkeys also very active in its diplomacy。
[Speaker 1]:  in the past few years，
[Speaker 1]:  turkey relationship with pakistan has been very close with many of pakistans attack，
[Speaker 1]:  helicopters，
[Speaker 1]:  ararmed vehicles and warships being turkish made just recently news broke，
[Speaker 1]:  ke turturkey prepreparing to join a strategic defensiallions with saudi arabia and pakistan。
[Speaker 1]:  this alliance is similar torado in attack on anyone country is considered an attack on all if the alliance is truly implemented。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey will interrectly gagain proprotection from nuclear weapons，
[Speaker 1]:  giving it more leverage in negotiations with major powers。
[Speaker 1]:  in january，
[Speaker 1]:  the turkish minister of transport announced that roles roise，
[Speaker 1]:  a british aircraft engine manufacturer to investing an istanable turkey to build europe's largest aircraft engine maintenance ance。
[Speaker 1]:  the projects total investment is expected to excceed US two point three，
[Speaker 1]:  two billion dollars，
[Speaker 1]:  and it expected to service two hundred engines annually generating US。
[Speaker 1]:  one point five billion dollars in annual revenue for turkish airlines。
[Speaker 1]:  the project will also create one thousand professional technical jobs，
[Speaker 1]:  hoping to upgrade turkeys manufacturing industry in return。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey signed an agreement with the UK last year to purchase twenty typhoon fighter jets for eight point one billion pounds，
[Speaker 1]:  a price that is significanhigher than usual。
[Speaker 1]:  some commentators suggest that the UK is selling the fighter jets at the price of friragets。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey's focus on engine technology stems from its own plans to sell fighter jets。
[Speaker 1]:  last august，
[Speaker 1]:  turkey signed an agreement with indonesia to sell forty eight domestically，
[Speaker 1]:  develop con fighter jets for US ten billion dollars。
[Speaker 1]:  the engines currently used in the con fighter jets still need to be imported from the united states，
[Speaker 1]:  and turkeys domestically developed engine is still in the early testing phase bribrish techchnology can turkey achieve a breakthrough in engine development。
[Speaker 1]:  the money spent will be quickly recrubed。
[Speaker 1]:  more recently，
[Speaker 1]:  turkey exported thirty vaned trainer aircraft spain。
[Speaker 1]:  each price of US one hundred million dollars turkey's aviation industry is price that making significant gains in europe。
[Speaker 1]:  chinese companies are also investing in turkey。
[Speaker 1]:  if twenty twenty four，
[Speaker 1]:  the EU imposed temporary tariff on chinese electric vehicles with BYDA major export，
[Speaker 1]:  potentially facing a seventeen point four percent terof increase。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey sees the opportunity announcing a forty percent terariff increase on chinese imported cars to avoid sanctions。
[Speaker 1]:  BYD quickly entered into negotiations with turkey expressing its willingness to invest US one billion dollars to build fffy there。
[Speaker 1]:  producing one hundred hundred fifty eleelecttric vehicles annually in return。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey revised its terarifiy there and no longer impose。
[Speaker 1]:  additional terterfs on BYDBYD is quick compromise to due to its desiss enenter eeuroan market through turkey。
[Speaker 1]:  and also because turkey now has its own domestic electric vehicle manufactur tog。
[Speaker 1]:  this provided leverage its negotiations last year，
[Speaker 1]:  talg sold nearly forty thousand electric vehicles in turkey，
[Speaker 1]:  outselling both tesla and BYD for several years when discussing turkey，
[Speaker 1]:  people often mention aergigans exchange ery policy，
[Speaker 1]:  using interest rate cuts to combat inflation and unconventional approached of the air economics。
[Speaker 1]:  so how is the turkish economy doing now？
[Speaker 1]:  although there have been significant advancements in military and diplomatic fields，
[Speaker 1]:  air dieconomics has failed the term air economics originated in twenty twenty one。
[Speaker 1]:  when airdewon announced that lowering interest rates would reduce corporate production costs and slow inflation from twenty twenty one to twenty twenty three。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey's deposit interest ate fell from fourperperent ent eight point five percent。
[Speaker 1]:  the central bank governor couldn't tolerate that any longer and felt the interest rates had to be raised。
[Speaker 1]:  addowine responded by saying that if the governor didn't change his mind，
[Speaker 1]:  he could be replaced。
[Speaker 1]:  he replaced three governors in two years。
[Speaker 1]:  initially，
[Speaker 1]:  edowine was lucky after the russia ukraine war broke out。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey benefit from its netriality earning significant cash reserves，
[Speaker 1]:  which did alleviate inflation to some extent。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  by twenty twenty three，
[Speaker 1]:  the turkeyh economy finally collapsed and eardowin admitted defeat on economic policy。
[Speaker 1]:  the central bank urgently raised interest rates from eight point five percent of fifty percent last year。
[Speaker 1]:  turkey's deposit interest rate remained high，
[Speaker 1]:  reaching thirty eight percent。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  despite this policy reversal，
[Speaker 1]:  turkey inflation problem remains very serious。
[Speaker 1]:  in december last year，
[Speaker 1]:  turkey CPI index increased by thirty point eight nine percent year on year，
[Speaker 1]:  with an average annual inflation rate of nearly five percent over the past two years，
[Speaker 1]:  even turyies inflation rate repeatedly approach eighty percent。
[Speaker 1]:  the same amount of money they could buy meet today might only buy loaf of bread tomorrow。
[Speaker 1]:  now turks and iranians once they find cash immediately try to convert it into US dollars，
[Speaker 1]:  euros and gold。
[Speaker 1]:  some small businesses even refused to accept the national currency，
[Speaker 1]:  only accepting foreign curcy goal。
[Speaker 1]:  therefore，
[Speaker 1]:  despite turkey granting vivisaffree entry，
[Speaker 1]:  chinese citizens in terms of prices and exchange rates，
[Speaker 1]:  china is still facing significant challenges besides high inflation。
[Speaker 1]:  the biggest problem eddowan faces his corruption for a long time。
[Speaker 1]:  the turkish economy similar to chinese during certain stages has relied on government led infrastructure projects for growth。
[Speaker 1]:  large local projects such as the estonbocancanalan major airports have been monopolized by few large contractors for owners are almost all relatives of erdowon。
[Speaker 1]:  the the twenty three three turish earthquake killed over fifty thousand people and damaged or destroyed more than three hundred thousand buildings。
[Speaker 1]:  it was later discovered the contractors to save costs had used sescent mixed with cement and the sterereinforcement。
[Speaker 1]:  the fications were severely substandard seassanconcontained salt，
[Speaker 1]:  which continuously corrode the substandard rebar，
[Speaker 1]:  causing buildings to collapsed during earearthquke。
[Speaker 1]:  although the eardowan government arrested some contractors，
[Speaker 1]:  the senior officials responsible for building inspection and approval remained unaffected。
[Speaker 1]:  many victims of the earthquake are still forced to live in containers with high prices and unsafe housing。
[Speaker 1]:  ordinary turks are unlikely to celebrate any overseas victories in the two，
[Speaker 1]:  twenty twenty four turkish local elections。
[Speaker 1]:  aergigans justice and development parties suffered a heavy blow almost all major cities，
[Speaker 1]:  including the capital，
[Speaker 1]:  lancher and unlargest city。
[Speaker 1]:  conasterm were won by the opposition to alleviate discontent。
[Speaker 1]:  addowan was forced to promise self reflection。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  more importantly，
[Speaker 1]:  he moved to consolidate power in march，
[Speaker 1]:  turkish police arrested istanable mayor or chra mamalluu on charges of aspianoge。
[Speaker 1]:  a mamalu was also a strong contender in the next turkish presidential election，
[Speaker 1]:  although he denied all charges，
[Speaker 1]:  he was still indicted by prosecutors late last year，
[Speaker 1]:  according to the prosecutors，
[Speaker 1]:  a mamalu caused turkey nearly four billion dollars in losses and could face a maximum sentence of two thousand，
[Speaker 1]:  three hundred fifty two years in prison last year。
[Speaker 1]:  in margins，
[Speaker 1]:  september tens of thousands of turks protested against the dowon government in the streets，
[Speaker 1]:  resulting in nearly two thousand arrests to this day，
[Speaker 1]:  airdowon continues to arrest。
[Speaker 1]:  opposition officials。
[Speaker 1]:  seventeen mayors have already been detained，
[Speaker 1]:  more conflicts and protests are likely to occur in turkey。
[Speaker 1]:  in the coming year。
[Speaker 1]:  a situation tourists should be aware of airdowon maintains his rule through forceas repression domestically，
[Speaker 1]:  while pursuing territory expansion and building new overseas military bases，
[Speaker 1]:  internationally chinese people。
[Speaker 1]:  upon seeing this immediately think of japan in the nineteen teen thirties。
[Speaker 1]:  from an international perspective，
[Speaker 1]:  the environment facing the eardowon regime is indeed some what similar to that of preworld world ar to japan。
[Speaker 1]:  at that time，
[Speaker 1]:  the british empiry's global order provided room for expansion for emerging powers。
[Speaker 1]:  now the united states is also relaxing its direct management of the global order，
[Speaker 1]:  allowing turkey to aspire to become a major player。
[Speaker 1]:  then britain and france relaxed their colomeal interest overseas。
[Speaker 1]:  now russia bog down in ukraine can only abandon its entire sphere of influence in china and africa。
[Speaker 1]:  therefore，
[Speaker 1]:  adwes sees the opportunity temporary，
[Speaker 1]:  ignoring domestic contradictions，
[Speaker 1]:  and use turkey's transportation hobstatus to simultanously expand across several continents，
[Speaker 1]:  aiming some extend to rebuild a sphere of influence of the autommate empire and gaa voice in the face of the three featter popower of china，
[Speaker 1]:  the US and erohohowever transforming from upto to a player requires paying a price while overseas fears of influence yield substantial long term benefits。
[Speaker 1]:  they require astronomical investment in the short term，
[Speaker 1]:  even the japanese empire，
[Speaker 1]:  which occupied chinese territory for more than a decade，
[Speaker 1]:  failed to convert its investments in northeast china ina to military power during world war two。
[Speaker 1]:  instead，
[Speaker 1]:  it consumed resources and affected domestic supply chains。
[Speaker 1]:  the current turkkish regime is similar。
[Speaker 1]:  it is propping up the image of a great power with a resources of a medium sized country，
[Speaker 1]:  and it's expansion spends thousands of kilometers。
[Speaker 1]:  it's teteorarily unclear when it's various strategic deployment will form a closed industrial chain，
[Speaker 1]:  therefore unless it can quickly seze oil fields in reimmediate significant returns。
[Speaker 1]:  aerggans overseas ventures will likely end here successfully consolidating what he has seized in the past few years，
[Speaker 1]:  would be considered a success in itself。
[Speaker 1]:  thank you for watching。
[Speaker 1]:  this concludes episode ten thirteen。
