Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 a
 very
 special


episode
 of
 the
 All
 Thoughts
 podcast.
 I'm


Tracy
 Aloway
 and
 I'm
 Joe
 Weisenthal.
 So


what
 you
 are
 about
 to
 hear
 has
 the
 very


very
 modest
 title
 of
 the
 best
 ever
 panel


on
 the
 world's
 most
 important
 market.


That
 is
 the
 US
 Treasury
 market.
 Of


course,
 this
 was
 recorded
 live
 at
 our


New
 York
 event
 on
 June
 26.
 That's
 right.


We
 had
 our
 recent
 OLATs
 live
 event
 in


New
 York.
 And
 there's
 so
 much
 going
 on


in
 the
 Treasury
 markets.
 There's


questions
 about
 rates.
 There's
 questions


about
 foreign
 demand.
 There's
 questions


about
 liquidity
 and
 the
 capacity
 of


existing
 Treasury
 market
 infrastructure


to
 handle
 all
 of
 the
 volume
 of
 debt
 out


there.
 So,
 we
 wanted
 together
 some
 of


our
 favorite
 people
 to
 actually


understand
 what's
 going
 on.
 Yep.
 Who's


going
 to
 buy
 all
 the
 bonds?
 And
 we
 did


indeed
 have
 an
 absolutely
 amazing
 panel.


So,
 we
 had
 Nelly
 Lang.
 She
 is
 a
 senior


fellow
 over
 at
 the
 Brookings


Institution.
 She
 is
 also
 the
 former


under
 secretary
 of
 the
 Treasury
 for


Domestic
 Finance.
 We
 had
 Ira
 Jersey,
 who


you
 might
 remember
 from
 a
 previous


episode.
 He
 is
 the
 chief
 US
 interest


rate
 strategist
 over
 at
 Bloomberg


Intelligence.
 And
 finally,
 we
 had
 an


OddLot's
 favorite,
 Josh
 Younger.
 He
 is
 a


lecturer
 at
 Columbia
 University,
 among


many
 other
 things.
 So,
 we
 hope
 you


enjoy.
 Take
 a
 listen.
 So,
 uh,
 is
 anyone


worried
 about
 who's
 going
 to
 buy
 the


debt?


Who
 goes
 first
 for
 that
 one?
 Well,


anyone?
 I
 I
 mean,
 I
 guess
 I'll
 start.
 Um


I
 I'm
 not
 worried
 about
 who's
 going
 to


buy
 the
 debt.
 Um
 you
 know
 when
 when
 we


think
 about
 markets
 generally
 and


especially
 markets
 for
 sovereign
 debt
 of


large
 countries
 that
 are
 relatively


liquid,
 there
 will
 be
 a
 buyer.
 Now
 the


price
 might
 change
 and
 I
 think
 that's


one
 of the
 things
 we
 have
 seen
 somewhat


um
 in
 recent
 weeks
 when
 you
 have


somewhat
 of
 a
 slowing
 economy
 in
 the
 US.


You
 certainly
 see
 like
 two-year
 yields


have
 actually
 gone
 down,
 you
 know,


better
 part
 of
 50
 basis
 points
 over
 the


near
 term,
 but
 the
 long
 end
 hasn't
 done


very
 much
 at
 all.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 that


is
 at least
 in
 part
 an
 indication
 that


there
 are
 some
 people
 who
 are
 a
 little


bit
 scared
 to
 buy
 that
 debt
 without


having
 some
 type
 of
 premium
 put
 onto
 it.


So
 it
 it'll
 get
 bought.
 The
 question
 is


at
 what
 price?
 And
 and
 that's
 different,


right?
 Like
 I'm
 an
 investment


strategist.
 I'm
 not
 a
 policy
 maker,


right?
 Right.
 And
 and
 I
 think
 that


there's
 some
 people
 who
 kind
 of
 messed


that
 up
 with
 what
 like
 our
 job
 is.
 When


Nelly
 was
 at
 the
 Treasury
 Department,


she
 had
 a
 much
 different,
 you
 know,
 view


of
 the
 world
 that
 she
 had
 to
 do
 as


opposed
 to
 what
 we
 do
 as
 investors.


Well,
 I
 mean,
 on
 that
 note,
 it
 is
 true


that
 we
 have
 more,
 I
 would
 say,
 price


sensitive
 buyers
 in
 the
 market
 than
 we


used
 to,
 right?
 So,
 we
 used
 to
 have
 a


lot
 of
 central
 banks,
 a
 lot
 of
 sovereign


wealth
 funds.
 they're
 still
 there,
 but


compared
 to
 domestic
 buyers,
 um,
 retail,


like
 that
 has
 grown
 a
 lot
 more.
 Nelly,


does
 that
 change
 the
 way
 you
 think
 about


debt
 versus,
 you
 know,
 some
 years
 ago?


Absolutely.
 So,
 you
 said
 prices
 will


adjust.
 There
 will
 be
 a
 buyer,
 but
 it


used
 to
 be
 decades
 ago,
 we
 just
 had
 a


much
 more
 stable
 investor
 base,
 central


banks,
 foreign
 funds.
 Um,
 now
 it's
 like


the
 non-bank,
 what
 we
 would
 call
 the


non-bank
 financial
 institutions.
 It's


hedge
 funds
 for
 various
 reasons,
 private


funds
 who
 use
 treasuries
 for
 liquidity


risk
 management.
 So
 the
 minute
 things


get
 volatile,
 they'll
 want
 to
 sell


treasuries
 to
 help
 manage
 their
 own


positions.
 And
 so
 the
 investor
 base
 has


changed.
 There
 will
 there
 will
 be
 buyers


but
 it
 could
 change
 the
 price
 and
 change


the
 way
 prices
 fluctuate.
 You
 know
 there


just
 going
 to
 be
 much
 more
 volatility


given
 the
 changing
 investor
 base.
 And


that's
 something
 that
 Treasury
 who
 has


to
 issue
 the
 debt
 regularly.
 We
 can
 we


we
 when
 I
 was
 at
 Treasury
 probably
 250


auctions
 a
 year.
 they
 think
 about
 that


and
 uh
 it
 does
 affect
 how
 you
 think


about
 bills
 versus
 longer
 term
 coupons


and
 all
 that.
 I
 guess
 I
 would
 different


way
 of
 saying
 the
 same
 thing.
 U
 I
 should


start
 with
 I
 I
 I
 thought
 I'd
 get
 away


from
 disclaimers
 when
 I
 left
 the
 feds


but
 I
 have
 to
 say
 a
 disclaimer
 which
 is


this
 is
 not
 investment
 advice
 and
 I


worked
 at
 a
 place
 that
 has
 lots
 of


positions
 and
 nothing
 I
 say
 should


implicate
 what
 which
 positions
 we
 may


have
 or
 not
 have.
 That
 said,
 uh
 I
 uh
 you


know,
 I
 think
 it's
 uh
 a
 similar
 way
 to


ask
 the
 question
 is
 why
 are
 they
 buying


the
 debt?
 Because
 the
 market's
 going
 to


clear
 at
 a
 price.
 Uh
 we
 may
 or
 may
 not


like
 that
 price,
 but
 prices
 used
 to


fluctuate
 like
 all
 over
 time
 for
 various


reasons.
 I
 mean
 during
 the
 civil
 war,
 we


had
 a
 captive
 demand
 base
 because
 if
 you


wanted
 to
 be
 a
 bank,
 you
 had
 to
 buy


treasuries.
 And
 yet
 the
 price
 moved,


right?
 And
 so
 for
 me
 it's
 are
 you
 buying


a
 security
 to
 hedge
 a
 liability
 that
 is


of
 similar
 duration
 to
 the
 thing
 you're


buying.
 Are
 you
 in
 it
 for
 the
 long
 haul?


And
 uh
 a
 classic
 example
 is
 like
 a
 life


insurance
 company
 which
 has
 very


long-term
 longevity
 indexed
 is
 the
 term


of
 art.
 Right?
 It's
 like
 as
 long
 as
 you


people
 are
 alive
 there's
 going
 to
 be


life
 insurance
 companies
 that
 have
 to


buy
 debt
 of
 similar
 length
 and
 they're


going
 to
 be
 very
 stable.
 They
 might
 be


price
 sensitive
 but
 probably
 less
 so.


And
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 they
 have


this
 liability
 that
 has
 to
 get
 funded.


Banks
 to
 the
 same
 extent
 have
 these
 very


long-term
 liabilities.
 Deposits
 are


long-term
 liabilities.
 I
 think
 we
 talked


about
 that
 on
 one
 of
 the
 episodes.
 So,


they
 need
 long-term
 assets
 to
 hedge


long-term
 liabilities
 because,
 you
 know,


you
 all
 have
 bank
 accounts.
 You
 can
 get


your
 money
 back
 whenever
 you
 want,
 but


you
 tend
 not
 to,
 right?
 So,
 that's
 a


long-term
 liability.
 A
 hedge
 fund
 is
 not


in
 it
 for
 10
 years
 because
 that
 is
 not


the
 nature
 of
 the
 of
 the
 business.
 Um,


they
 are
 responding
 to
 price
 signals
 and


relative
 value.
 Treasury
 trading
 is


really
 just
 a
 response
 to
 price
 signals


where
 the
 market
 is
 attempting
 to
 find


the
 lowest
 cost
 buyer.
 There's
 this


great
 book
 from
 the
 19th
 century
 which


is
 inspiration
 for
 Freriedman.
 I'm
 not
 a


Freeman
 knight
 but
 like
 it's
 an


interesting
 story
 which
 is
 called


feeding
 Paris
 which
 is
 by
 Bastiat
 and
 a


French
 economist
 and
 he
 was
 saying
 if


one
 person
 was
 responsible
 for
 feeding


Paris,
 everyone
 would
 die
 because
 it's


impossible
 to
 feed
 a
 million
 people
 if


you're
 making
 all
 these
 decisions
 on


your
 own.
 So
 price
 signals
 get
 the
 food


to
 where
 it
 has
 to
 go
 when
 it
 has
 to
 go


there.
 And
 so
 like
 the
 miracle
 of
 of
 of


the
 price
 mechanism
 is
 the
 fact
 that


Paris
 wakes
 up
 every
 morning
 um
 and
 has


food
 and
 and
 it's
 still
 true,
 right?
 I


mean
 cities
 are
 complicated.
 And
 so
 the


the
 in
 the
 Treasury
 market
 case,
 the
 the


feeding
 Paris
 equivalent
 is
 basis
 trades


and
 swap
 spread
 trades
 and
 every
 every


instance
 of
 buying
 a
 security
 with


levered
 money
 repo
 and
 things
 like
 that


and
 hedging
 the
 risk
 with
 the
 derivative


where
 the
 price
 difference
 between
 those


things
 makes
 that
 worthwhile.
 And
 that's


also
 a
 signal
 that
 we
 don't
 have
 enough


of
 those
 liability
 hedgers
 who
 are
 in
 it


for
 the
 long
 haul.
 We
 have
 to
 find


somebody
 else.
 What
 are
 the
 data
 points


we
 should
 be
 looking
 at?
 Because
 if
 I


look
 at
 the
 10-year
 yield,
 you
 know,


it's
 something
 to
 do
 with
 the
 long-term


trajectory
 of
 monetary
 policy
 and
 that's


going
 to
 fluctuate
 for
 various
 reasons,


inflation
 growth,
 etc.
 If
 we
 want
 to


capture
 some
 of
 these
 other
 dynamics


such
 as
 the
 change
 in
 who
 are
 the
 buyers


or
 the
 just
 the
 desire
 to
 even
 own
 US


dollar
 denominated
 debt
 assets,
 what


should
 what
 else
 should
 we
 be
 looking


at?
 Well,
 so
 so
 the
 way
 that
 I
 look
 at


US
 treasuries,
 assuming
 that
 there's
 not


real
 credit
 risk,
 right?
 And
 I
 would
 I


would
 still
 I
 would
 still
 argue
 that


there's
 still
 not
 credit
 risk
 more
 than


a
 couple
 of
 basis
 points
 that's
 embedded


in
 the
 the
 current
 yield
 of
 say
 the


10-year
 Treasury.
 Then
 10-year


treasuries
 the
 again
 the
 way
 that
 I
 look


at
 it
 it
 have
 to
 be
 somewhere
 around


nominal
 GDP
 growth
 right
 so
 basically
 at


the
 trajectory
 of
 what
 is
 the
 growth


rate
 of
 the
 country
 in
 the
 longer
 run


and
 that's
 what
 the
 market
 is
 going
 to


spit
 out
 plus
 or
 minus
 like
 you
 said


some
 kind
 of
 liquidity
 or
 either
 premium


or
 discount.
 Now,
 I
 would
 argue
 that


with
 treasuries,
 to
 Josh's
 point
 right


there,
 is
 that
 markets
 that
 have
 deep


liquid
 funding
 markets,
 deep
 liquid


derivatives
 markets,
 in
 order
 for


someone
 to
 hedge
 that
 risk,
 you
 tend
 to


get
 better
 outcomes
 and
 lower
 yields


because
 of
 that.
 So,
 you
 know,
 we
 did
 a


study.
 I
 actually
 um
 when
 I
 was
 back
 at


Credit
 Swiss,
 I
 did
 something
 actually


for
 the
 for
 a
 World
 Bank
 study
 about


what
 is
 liquidity
 in
 just
 about
 every


single
 OECD
 government
 bond
 market
 in


the
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 what
 you


determined
 is
 bid
 offers
 were
 tightest


when
 you
 had
 deep
 and
 liquid
 funding


markets
 like
 repo
 and
 when
 you
 had


derivative
 markets.
 So
 you
 you
 look
 at


Italy
 that
 basically
 didn't
 have
 a


derivative
 market
 that
 was
 particularly


deep
 and
 liquid
 versus
 a
 France
 which


did
 and
 a
 Spain
 that
 did
 actually.
 So
 so


Spanish
 spreads
 were
 actually
 tighter


than
 Italian
 spreads.
 Um,
 not
 that
 the


yield
 levels
 might
 have
 been
 the
 same,


but
 but
 the
 the
 difference
 is
 those
 deep


liquid
 like
 ancillary
 markets
 around


things
 matter.
 And
 that's
 where
 the
 US


is
 unlike
 any
 other
 country
 in
 the
 world


because
 we
 have
 all
 of
 those
 things
 in


abundance
 that
 very
 few
 other
 markets


have,
 you
 know,
 and
 and
 I
 think
 that's


one
 reason
 why
 it's
 going
 to
 be


difficult
 for
 people
 not
 to
 be
 involved


with
 treasuries
 either
 as
 a
 liability


management
 tool
 or
 as
 a
 trading
 in


instrument.


Uh,
 well,
 oh,
 Nelly,
 please.
 I
 was
 just


going
 to
 add
 I
 think
 just
 to
 emphasize


you
 know
 it
 is
 long-term
 how
 to
 think


about
 yields
 long-term
 nominal
 GDP


growth
 but
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 uncertainty


about
 that
 growth
 and
 that
 comes
 and
 you


know
 that
 fluctuates
 and
 so
 if
 you're


uncertain
 about
 inflation
 even
 if
 you


have
 an
 expected
 path
 of
 inflation
 if


it's
 high
 it
 might
 be
 more
 volatile
 or


if
 you're
 uncertain
 about
 policies
 any


kind
 of
 policy
 either
 you
 know
 whether


you're
 going
 to
 support
 the
 dollar
 or


you're
 going
 to
 support
 the
 US
 as
 a
 safe


haven
 or
 you're
 going
 to
 support
 debt
 or


try
 to
 reduce
 debt
 that
 adds


uncertainty.
 So
 then
 treasuries
 you
 know


like
 in
 long
 long
 run
 it
 is
 nominal
 GDP


but
 in
 the
 meantime
 you're
 kind
 of
 going


to
 fluctuate
 what
 these
 we
 call
 premiums


or
 discounts
 you
 know
 depending
 on
 how


much
 uncertainty
 there
 is
 about
 that
 I


tend
 to
 think
 there's
 a
 fair
 amount
 of


uncertainty
 about
 that
 right
 now.
 Can


you
 convince
 Joe
 that
 there
 is
 such
 a


thing
 as
 the
 term
 premium?


Well,
 yes
 because
 so
 because
 if
 you


define
 term
 premium
 as
 the
 expectations


hypothesis


less
 whatever
 the
 current
 yield
 is


there's
 a
 residual
 and
 that
 is
 a
 term


premium.
 Then
 you
 just
 try
 to
 define
 you


try
 to
 use
 things
 you
 know
 about
 to


explain
 the
 residual
 but
 there's
 always


something
 left
 and
 that
 to
 me
 is
 a
 term


premium
 empirically.
 I
 empirically
 I


don't
 know
 if
 I'm
 going
 to
 convince
 you,


but
 I
 think
 I
 called
 it
 on
 uh
 Bloomberg


radio
 actually.
 I
 called
 it
 the
 uh
 the


dark
 matter
 of
 um
 of
 the
 Treasury


market,
 right?
 That
 term
 premium
 must


exist.
 The
 question
 is,
 do
 we
 measure
 it


properly,
 right?
 That
 and
 and
 that's
 the


art
 of
 it
 as
 opposed
 to
 the
 science
 of


of
 term
 premium.
 So,
 I
 like
 the
 easiest


possible
 way
 to
 do
 this,
 which
 is
 just


to
 ask
 people
 what
 they
 think
 short


rates
 are
 going
 to
 be
 over
 the
 long
 run.


Yeah.
 And
 what
 long-term
 rates
 are
 going


to
 be
 tomorrow.
 And
 the
 Philly
 Fed
 does


this
 every
 quarter.
 And
 there
 is
 a
 term


the
 Philly
 Fed.
 Okay,
 same
 more.
 So
 they


just
 ask
 economists
 to
 make
 predictions


as
 to
 what
 they
 think
 this
 that
 or
 the


other
 thing
 are
 going
 to
 do.
 And
 there's


like
 inflation
 and
 GDP
 growth
 and
 all


these
 other
 things.
 But
 once
 a
 year,
 I


think
 the
 first
 quarter,
 so
 we
 probably


get
 that
 either
 now
 or
 soon.
 They
 ask


10ear
 average
 T
 bill
 yields
 and
 then


they
 also
 ask
 about
 the
 tenure
 yield.


And
 so
 you're
 just
 literally
 asking


people
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 bells
 and


whistles
 you
 can
 put
 on
 these
 models.


And
 some
 of
 the
 models
 with
 bells
 and


whistles
 incorporate
 the
 survey
 data.


Some
 people
 just
 look
 only
 at
 the
 survey


data.
 Some
 people
 do
 just
 the
 modeling,


but
 in
 all
 these
 cases,
 there's
 a


residual.
 Um,
 doesn't
 mean
 it's
 positive


is
 the
 really
 key
 thing.
 Turner
 term


premium
 can
 be
 negative,
 which
 you
 can


see
 why
 I'm
 unsatisfied.
 Yeah.
 Like
 this


is
 the
 thing.
 It's
 dark
 matter.
 They
 ask


these
 surveys.
 Yeah.
 Which
 doesn't


really
 like
 they
 ask
 this
 they
 ask
 a


random
 survey.
 Sometimes
 it
 gets


negative.
 Like
 you
 can
 see
 why
 like
 I'm


skeptical.
 Like
 I'm
 not
 totally


satisfied
 by
 any
 of
 this.
 No,
 but


there's
 a
 difference
 between
 the


two-year
 yield
 and
 the
 10-year
 yield.
 So


therefore
 that
 difference
 also
 true.
 No,


that
 could
 be
 the
 expectations
 of
 of


race
 between
 two
 and
 10.
 But
 you
 can


write
 down
 what
 you
 think
 or
 a
 survey
 of


what
 you
 think
 is
 between
 the
 two
 and
 10


and
 there's
 usually
 a
 residual
 and
 can


be
 positive
 or
 negative
 and
 having
 it


can
 often
 be
 explained
 correlated
 with


things
 like
 inflation
 expectations
 or


other
 kinds
 of
 uncertainty.
 I
 can
 tell


you
 from
 experience
 with
 both
 dark


matter
 and
 turn
 premium.
 Oh
 yeah,
 Josh


was
 an
 actual
 astrophysicist.
 So
 both


deeply
 unsatisfying.
 Um
 so
 wait,
 what's


dark
 matter
 in
 the
 uh
 from
 the
 physics


perspective?
 Well,
 we
 don't
 know
 what
 it


is.
 We
 just
 know
 it's
 there.
 Uh
 there


were
 attempts
 to
 explain
 it
 away
 in


various
 like
 trying
 to
 hang
 on
 to
 the


old
 way
 we
 think
 about
 the
 world
 is
 full


of
 stuff
 that
 we
 can
 touch
 and
 see.


Yeah.
 But
 those
 never
 worked
 and
 there's


just
 too
 much
 of
 it.
 Um
 and
 then
 don't


get
 me
 started
 on
 dark
 energy
 which
 is


the
 opposite,
 right?
 And
 so
 I
 I
 I
 worked


for
 uh
 for
 someone
 at
 Hopkins
 years
 ago


who
 for
 his
 his
 PhD
 thesis
 he
 was
 told


to
 confirm
 other
 experiments
 to
 measure


the
 size
 and
 shape
 of
 the
 universe.
 And


part
 of
 that
 was
 weighing
 it.
 And
 so
 he


did
 that
 experiment
 using
 supernoving


which
 is
 a
 different
 way
 to
 do
 this.


Lots
 of
 different
 ways
 to
 do
 things.
 Got


a
 negative
 number.
 Super
 unsatisfying.


Negative
 mass
 density
 of
 the
 universe


which
 you
 immediately
 you'd
 say
 like


okay
 well
 this
 was
 a
 waste.
 Why
 did
 I


spend
 two
 years
 doing
 this?
 instead
 he


ran
 with
 it
 and
 it
 turned
 out
 it
 was


super
 real
 and
 he
 got
 a
 Nobel
 Prize
 from


that
 outcome
 which
 I'm
 not
 saying
 will


come
 from
 term
 premium
 modless
 but
 but


sometimes
 the
 deeply
 unsatisfying
 thing


is
 the
 more
 you
 dig
 into
 it
 the
 more


it's
 real
 and
 I
 think
 that
 any
 way
 you


slice
 that
 information
 either
 literally


asking
 people
 or
 trying
 to
 model
 what


the
 market's
 telling
 you
 in
 some
 super


sophisticated
 way
 you
 always
 come
 up


with
 a
 residual
 now
 the
 question
 is
 what


is
 that
 term
 premium
 telling
 you
 and
 can


you
 find
 consistent
 ways
 to
 measure
 it


and
 track
 it
 and
 there's
 positive


negative
 thing
 is
 clearly
 the
 case
 and


you
 know
 there's
 different
 microeconomic


ways
 to
 explain
 why
 that
 should
 or


should
 not
 be
 true.
 It
 really
 comes
 down


to
 uncertainty.
 So
 and
 is
 the


uncertainty
 correlated
 with
 yields.
 So


if
 I
 don't
 know
 what's
 going
 to
 happen


in
 the
 future
 to
 the
 economy,
 is
 that


uncertainty
 greater
 or
 lesser
 when
 the


rates
 go
 up
 or
 down?
 And
 that
 naturally


generates
 these
 dislocations.


[Music]


Can
 you
 talk
 about
 the
 existence
 of


something
 else
 which
 is
 bond
 vigilantes?


So,
 we
 just
 we
 just
 heard
 Taleb
 talk


about
 the
 deficit.
 And
 yet,
 I
 feel
 like


the
 notion
 that
 there
 are
 investors


that,
 you
 know,
 wake
 up
 one
 morning
 and


say,
 "Oh,
 wait.
 I'm
 really
 worried
 about


the
 deficit.
 Today's
 the
 day
 I'm
 going


to,
 you
 know,
 sell
 all
 my
 bond


exposure."
 That
 probably
 doesn't
 happen


that
 often.
 And
 then
 secondly,
 Nelly,
 I


would
 be
 very
 interested
 in
 your
 take
 on


this,
 but
 you
 know,
 when
 you
 were
 at


Treasury,
 did
 you
 sit
 in
 the
 office


going
 like,
 "Oh,
 the
 bond
 vigilantes
 are


going
 to
 get
 me.
 I
 better
 be
 disciplined


with
 my
 issuance
 schedule.


Um,
 was
 that
 a
 question
 for
 me
 or
 for


everyone?
 Everyone.
 Okay.
 Well,
 let
 me


just
 No,
 I
 didn't
 sit
 there
 with
 with


that.
 And
 I
 was
 at
 the
 Fed
 for
 30
 years


before
 I
 went
 to
 Treasury.
 And
 you
 do


care
 a
 lot
 about
 bond
 yields.
 I
 mean,


it's
 sort
 of
 fundamental
 to
 the
 way


monetary
 policy
 works.
 It's
 fundamental


to
 the
 way
 you
 issue
 treasuries,
 but
 you


don't
 think
 about
 it
 on
 a
 daily
 basis.


But
 it
 really
 influences
 how
 you
 view


events
 like
 these
 scarce
 events
 and
 if


um
 these
 like
 you
 know
 shocks
 that
 you


weren't
 which
 by
 definition
 you're
 not


expecting
 but
 if
 you've
 got
 a
 system


where
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 leverage
 and
 you


have
 an
 unexpected
 shock
 people
 are


going
 to
 make
 trades
 and
 change


positions
 and
 that's
 when
 you
 worry
 but


it's
 not
 an
 ongoing
 thing.
 So
 those


kinds
 of
 to
 sort
 of
 prevent
 that
 you


spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 as
 a
 policy
 maker


where
 do
 we
 understand
 where
 the


leverage
 is
 and
 how
 can
 we
 keep
 it


manageable
 and
 make
 sure
 they
 can
 keep


their
 funding.
 This
 is
 gets
 to
 the
 point


the
 funding
 being
 you
 know
 fundamental


to
 being
 able
 to
 trade
 treasuries.
 So


it's
 kind
 of
 a
 bigger
 picture
 but
 it's


not
 a
 daily
 thing.
 I
 don't
 but
 um
 but


it's
 important.
 I
 actually
 think
 it's
 a


really
 important
 market
 disciplining


mechanism.
 Yeah.
 The
 level
 of
 debt


matters,
 right?
 So
 the
 the
 bod


finchelantes,
 like
 there's
 no
 group
 of


people
 who
 get
 together
 at
 a
 bar
 and


say,
 hey,
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 sell


treasuries.
 Today's
 the
 day.
 Yeah.


Exactly.
 Like
 like,
 hey,
 tomorrow,
 you


know,
 the
 debt
 is
 going
 to
 be
 too
 big.


Let's
 just
 sell
 treasuries.
 The
 the


issue,
 I
 think,
 is
 manifests
 itself
 in


multiple
 ways.
 And
 one
 is
 this
 the


steepening
 of
 the
 yield
 curve
 that
 we've


seen,
 right?
 in
 a
 in
 a
 normal


environment.
 You'd
 expect
 that
 anyway
 if


the
 Federal
 Reserve
 was
 expected
 to
 cut


rates,
 which
 it
 certainly
 has.
 But
 at


the
 same
 time,
 you
 know,
 you
 do
 have
 a


growing
 fear
 that
 when
 you
 have
 two


trillion,
 $2.5
 trillion
 deficits
 every


year
 and
 we
 wind
 up
 in
 a
 in
 a
 in
 a
 debt


trap
 where
 interest
 rates
 and
 the


interest
 on
 the
 debt
 ends
 up
 being
 so


large
 that
 the
 fiscal
 agents
 in


Washington
 will
 have
 to
 do
 something


about
 it.
 but
 the
 market
 hasn't
 yet


forced
 them
 into
 it.
 And
 and
 I
 think


that
 that's
 that
 forcing
 um
 that
 forcing


the
 government
 to
 actually
 act
 and
 do


something
 is
 really
 what
 might
 have
 to


be
 the
 impetus
 for
 you
 to
 actually
 get


some
 kind
 of
 fiscal
 response.
 The


challenge
 is
 political,
 right?
 And
 and


that
 is
 because
 50
 plus%
 of
 our
 debt
 is


interest
 of
 excuse
 me
 of
 our
 spending
 by


the
 federal
 government
 is
 Medicare,


Social
 Security,
 and
 interest
 on
 the


debt.
 Well,
 those
 are
 hard
 things
 to


contend
 with,
 right?
 It's
 really,
 really


difficult.
 So,
 I
 I I
 believe
 in
 bond


vigilantes,
 is
 not
 in
 a
 US
 context.
 And


what
 I
 mean
 by
 that
 is
 when
 we
 talk


about
 bond
 vigilantes,
 we're
 really


referring
 to
 the
 '9s
 em
 crisis
 where
 the


concern
 was
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 get
 my


dollar.
 They
 were
 dollar
 bonds.
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 get
 these
 dollars
 back
 because


the
 counterparty
 to
 this
 debt
 doesn't


have
 them
 and
 can't
 get
 them
 at
 a


reasonable
 price.
 And
 so,
 the
 bond
 will


default
 and
 therefore
 I
 want
 to
 get


ahead
 of
 this
 default
 because,
 you
 know,


the
 classic
 bank
 run.
 and
 I
 want
 to
 get


out
 before
 everyone
 else
 is
 before
 I'm


stuck.
 In
 the
 US
 context,
 you
 don't
 have


that
 problem.
 So,
 the
 question
 is
 who's


going
 to
 wake
 up
 and
 sell
 and
 why?
 I'm


saying
 why
 again.
 Um
 and
 and
 they
 will


sell
 because
 they
 are
 forced
 to
 sell.


And
 we've
 had
 the
 repo
 vigilantes,
 so
 to


speak,
 strike
 in
 2020
 and
 in
 2025.
 And


they
 were
 forced
 to
 sell
 for
 a
 variety


of
 reasons.
 One
 was
 just
 the
 increase
 in


the
 volatility
 of
 the
 market
 in
 general.


Um
 and
 then
 there
 were
 margin
 calls


especially
 in
 2020
 where
 they
 were


delevered.
 Um
 and
 the
 uh
 the
 the
 the


question
 then
 becomes
 like
 are
 we


heading
 for
 that
 kind
 of
 scenario?
 And


the
 reason
 why
 the
 debt
 growth
 matters


is
 because
 these
 repo
 vigilantes
 are
 not


worried
 about
 the
 credit
 of
 the
 bonds


they
 hold.
 They're
 worried
 no
 one
 will


buy
 them
 from
 them
 because
 the
 banking


system
 or
 the
 dealer,
 the
 bank


affiliated
 dealers
 that
 are
 be
 supposed


to
 be
 on
 the
 other
 side
 of
 these
 trades


won't
 have
 capacity
 and
 every
 trade's


going
 to
 keep
 ticking
 cheaper
 and


cheaper
 and
 cheaper
 and
 they're
 going
 to


be
 in
 a
 difficult
 like
 sort
 of


marktomarket
 situation.
 But
 that's
 a


very
 different
 set
 of
 considerations.


Yeah.
 And
 it's
 sort
 of
 related
 to


overall
 growth
 in
 the
 debt,
 but
 it's


also
 related
 to
 the
 structure
 of
 the


market
 and
 how
 it
 places
 it.
 Since
 we're


here
 and
 we're
 just
 clarifying
 things


for
 me
 that
 I've
 always
 wanted
 to,
 you


know,
 learn
 about
 for
 years,
 over
 10


years,
 I've
 been
 sitting
 at
 my
 Bloomberg


terminal.
 Every
 once
 in a
 while
 you
 get


a
 red
 headline
 and
 it
 talks
 about
 like


bid
 to
 cover
 in
 the
 tail
 and
 I
 can
 never


tell
 if
 any
 of
 these
 auction
 statistics


really
 make
 a
 difference.
 Like,
 oh,


terrible
 auction
 and
 then
 it
 was
 a
 good


auction.


What
 how
 should
 I
 consume
 that


information?
 How
 useful
 is
 that?
 Or
 for


whom
 is
 that
 useful?
 So,
 so,
 so
 we


actually
 started
 just
 earlier
 this
 year


in
 Bloomberg
 Intelligence
 having
 a


grading
 methodology
 where
 we
 actually


grade
 these
 from
 D
 to
 A
 plus
 and
 you


know
 we
 we
 we
 look
 at
 a
 variety
 of
 the


bidding
 metrics
 in
 order
 to
 do
 that
 and


and
 how
 they
 compare
 to
 recent
 history.


So,
 one
 of
 the
 big
 things
 that
 you've


seen
 and
 this
 goes
 to
 Josh's
 thing
 uh


issues
 about
 structure.
 you
 go
 back


about
 10
 12
 years
 and
 you
 saw
 that


primary
 dealers
 were
 the
 biggest
 buyers


of
 coupon
 uh
 coupon
 debt.
 Today
 they're


the
 smallest.
 So
 you
 actually
 in
 the


recent
 auctions
 for
 example
 that
 we
 just


had
 this
 this
 week
 uh
 we
 did a


seven-year
 auction
 earlier
 today
 we
 had


five
 year
 yesterday.
 Um
 the
 uh
 dealers


only
 bought
 about
 10%
 of
 the
 bonds


whereas
 if
 you
 went
 back
 to
 2012
 2013
 it


would
 have
 been
 they
 would
 have
 bought


40
 to
 60%
 of
 those
 auctions.
 So
 the


bidding
 metrics
 matter
 and
 it
 matters


because
 you
 can
 see
 where
 the
 primary


demand
 is
 coming
 from.
 And
 we
 know
 now


that
 you
 know
 dealers
 because
 of
 the


changes
 in
 market
 structure
 that
 have


occurred
 particularly
 since
 the


institution
 of
 Basil
 3
 are
 are
 much


smaller
 buyers
 and
 and
 you
 know


basically
 end
 users
 are
 much
 larger


buyers
 and
 and
 some
 of
 those
 are
 high


frequency
 traders
 or
 maybe
 people
 who


have
 repo
 books
 and
 kind
 of
 need
 to
 fill


them
 by
 by
 getting
 some
 collateral.
 So


all
 of
 those
 bidding
 metrics
 matter,
 but


the
 tails
 will
 show
 you
 that
 the
 market


was
 mispriced
 at
 the
 time
 that
 the


auction
 closed
 versus
 what
 the
 aggregate


demand
 was
 at
 that
 auction.
 And
 that's


that
 tail
 is
 the
 single
 most
 important


thing
 to
 look
 at
 followed
 by
 then
 some


of
 the
 details
 in
 there
 about
 who
 was


actually
 purchasing
 and
 then
 u
 you
 know


how
 much
 they
 bid
 for.
 So,
 since
 we


brought
 up
 market
 structure,
 it
 is
 true


that
 the
 Treasury
 market
 has
 experienced


a
 number
 of
 volatility
 events
 at
 this


point,
 which
 is
 weird
 because
 in
 theory,


it's
 supposed
 to
 be
 a
 pretty
 boring
 kind


of
 stayed
 old-fashioned
 market
 and
 it's


been
 anything
 but.
 You're
 telling
 me


that
 I'm
 I've
 been
 boring.
 I'm
 so
 sorry.


I'm
 so
 sorry.
 Well,
 not
 anymore.
 That's


the
 good
 news.
 It's
 supposed
 to
 be


supposed
 to
 be.
 Um,
 and
 we
 have
 all


these
 things
 that
 have
 been
 put
 in
 place


after
 every
 single
 volatility
 event


like,
 you
 know,
 the
 RRP,
 the
 standing


repo
 facility.
 We
 just
 had
 a
 change
 to


the
 supplementary
 leverage
 ratio
 to
 help


dealer
 banks
 hold
 more
 treasuries.
 Why


do
 we
 still
 seem
 to
 have
 these
 V
 events


happening?


I
 guess
 my
 we
 should
 have
 them


sometimes.
 So,
 the
 idea
 that
 treasury


markets
 never
 had
 events.
 I
 mean,
 go


back
 to
 the
 90s
 and
 there
 were
 massive
 V


events
 in
 like
 2003.
 there's
 a
 massive


mortgage
 extension.
 There
 was
 a
 surprise


75
 basis
 point
 hike
 in
 the
 night.
 So,


there's
 always
 been
 these
 events.
 I


think
 the
 the
 difference
 now
 is
 it's


harder
 to
 pinpoint
 a
 fundamental
 source.


Like
 usually
 back
 then
 you
 could
 say,


"Oh,
 this
 was
 the
 GSC's
 this
 was
 the
 Fed


hiking
 rates
 in
 a
 way
 that
 people
 didn't


expect.
 Now
 there's
 like
 this
 whole
 like


process
 of
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 why
 this


is
 happening
 and
 and
 it
 it
 tends
 to
 um


happen
 very
 quickly
 and
 it
 tends
 to


disrupt
 a
 lot
 of
 relationships."
 But


like
 I
 I
 think
 in
 one
 sense
 this
 is


stuff
 that's
 been
 happening
 in
 the
 past.


It's
 just
 the
 market
 is
 much
 larger.
 The


banking
 system's
 ability
 to
 provide
 that


offset
 is
 is
 is
 lesser.
 Um
 and
 uh
 the


the
 the
 the
 frequency
 with
 which
 trades


happen
 just
 really
 gone
 up.
 I
 mean
 like


the
 markets
 are
 very
 active
 now.
 But
 I


think
 that's
 all
 kind
 of
 a
 symptom
 of


the
 issue
 which
 is
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 a


just
 in
 time
 supply
 version
 of
 treasury


markets
 which
 is
 you
 have
 dealers
 can't


hold
 a
 lot
 of
 inventory.
 So
 they
 have
 to


match
 trades
 really
 efficiently.
 It
 used


to
 be
 if
 you
 didn't
 know
 the
 buyer
 and


the
 seller,
 you
 just
 hold
 it
 overnight.


Now
 the
 high
 frequency
 traders
 do
 that


for
 them
 in
 a
 very
 efficient
 fast-paced


way.
 And
 then
 the
 dealers
 are
 trying
 to


get
 hedge
 funds
 and
 through
 the
 price


mechanism
 to
 hold
 inventory
 on
 their


behalf
 because
 basis
 trades
 are


basically
 what
 dealers
 used
 to
 do.
 And


that's
 all
 very
 fragile.
 And
 so
 that


combination
 of
 things
 generates
 these


shocks
 because
 the
 whole
 that


arrangement
 can
 collapse
 very
 quickly.


But
 you
 know
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 like


the
 the
 size
 of
 the
 market
 is
 growing


faster.
 Yeah.
 than
 the
 dealers
 have


capacity
 to
 to
 use.
 Nelly.
 Yeah.
 I
 just


to
 provide
 like
 a
 policy
 makers


perspective
 like
 if
 you
 just
 step
 back


there's
 just
 been
 so
 many
 changes
 in


technology
 and
 then
 the
 changes
 in
 the


buyer
 base.
 We
 talked
 about
 the


structural
 change
 on
 who
 buys
 now
 versus


then.
 So
 like
 in
 2014
 there
 was


something
 called
 a
 flash
 rally
 in
 the


trade.
 I
 remember
 that.
 Remember
 and


like
 no
 one
 understood
 why
 the
 Treasury


yield
 went
 up
 and
 down
 like
 30
 basis


points
 in
 2
 minutes
 and
 reversed
 and
 it


was
 it
 kind
 of
 scared
 the
 public
 sector,


you
 know,
 the
 government
 officials
 like


how
 is
 this
 possible?
 What
 is
 the
 trade


and
 had
 to
 do
 a
 lot
 with
 these
 new


highfrequency
 traders?
 It
 took
 a
 lot
 of


time
 to
 like
 dissect
 what
 happened.
 So


that
 was
 even
 before
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of


treasury
 debt.
 Now
 we
 have
 more
 treasury


debt
 and
 there's
 just
 you
 know
 the


volume.
 But
 I
 guess
 I
 would
 also


separate
 the
 I
 would
 make
 a
 distinction


between
 volatility
 events
 and
 then


market
 illiquidity
 events
 just
 because


if
 the
 mark
 if
 news
 is
 volatile,
 there's


new
 changes
 in
 the
 economy,
 you
 would


expect


Treasury
 yields
 and
 prices
 to
 be


volatile.
 They
 should.
 They're
 supposed


to
 reflect
 that.
 And
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


what's
 been
 happening
 recently.
 But
 the


concerns
 are
 when
 you
 can't
 transact


easily
 and
 quickly
 because
 you've
 pulled


in
 more
 dealers
 pulled
 in
 more
 than
 they


might
 normally
 would
 just
 because
 of
 the


higher
 volatility.
 So
 you
 you
 should


always
 get
 a
 little
 well
 you
 should


always
 get
 a
 little
 less
 liquidity
 when


things
 get
 volatile
 you
 know
 just


because
 risk
 is
 higher
 but
 it's
 when


they
 sort
 of
 stop
 making
 markets
 or
 stop


posting
 or
 something
 then
 and
 you
 can't


actually
 transact
 those
 are
 the
 things


that
 the
 policy
 makers
 really
 care
 about


it
 it
 there's
 there's
 this
 balancing


thing
 where
 we
 want
 treasure
 marks
 to
 be


deep
 and
 liquid.
 Deep
 liquid
 means
 it's


inexpensive
 to
 transact
 which
 means
 the


dealers
 don't
 make
 much
 money
 per
 trade.


So
 the
 old
 joke
 like
 we're
 making
 losses


but
 we'll
 make
 up
 for
 it
 in
 volume
 kind


of
 thing
 and
 like
 hopefully
 not
 that
 but


the
 the
 uh
 the
 respon
 if
 you
 want
 low


transaction
 costs
 the
 the
 way
 you
 get


that
 and
 still
 have
 functioning


businesses
 leverage
 and
 this
 this
 has


been
 the
 case
 for
 you
 know
 75
 years


since
 the
 Treasury
 Fed
 that
 this
 was


always
 the
 core
 issue
 and
 so
 when
 you


leverage
 constrain
 banks
 and
 even
 if
 the


bank
 isn't
 leverage
 constrained
 when
 the


desk
 is
 leverage
 constrained
 when


leverage
 is
 a
 zero
 sum
 game
 within
 the


institution
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 these


leverage
 ratios
 do
 everyone's
 fighting


over
 the
 same
 resource
 and
 that
 process


introduces
 friction
 and
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 I
 think
 these
 V
 events
 are


mostly
 just
 time
 slippage
 like
 if
 you


have
 to
 think
 about
 things
 for
 too
 long


the
 market
 can
 run
 away
 from
 you
 so
 you


know
 in
 2020
 if
 you
 had
 to
 spend
 two


days
 figuring
 out
 who
 gets
 incremental


balance
 sheet
 a
 lot
 can
 happen
 in
 two


days
 in
 March
 of
 2020
 and
 and
 and
 these


very
 human
 experiences
 are
 kind
 of
 what


drive
 uh
 the
 thing
 and
 we
 talked
 about


this
 on
 on
 the
 show
 that
 we
 did
 back
 in


uh
 in
 late
 April
 about
 the
 April
 event


and
 that
 time
 slippage
 is
 exactly
 a
 big


thing
 part
 of
 what
 happened
 when
 when


right
 before
 you
 fell
 asleep


on
 on
 April
 9th,
 right?
 Um
 it's
 because


like
 look,
 you
 you
 can't
 call
 the
 New


York
 dealer
 desk
 to
 get
 more
 dealer


balance
 sheet
 at
 11:30
 at
 night
 New
 York


time
 um
 when
 you're
 trading
 in
 Hong


Kong,
 right?
 It's
 it's
 just
 hard
 to
 do


that.
 So
 So
 you
 get
 these
 VA
 events
 that


that
 are
 create
 illquid
 markets
 but
 only


at
 certain
 points
 in
 time,
 right?
 Right.


And
 and
 then
 that
 always
 gets
 arbed


away.
 You
 know,
 people
 are
 are,
 you


know,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 we're
 we're


definitely
 not
 price
 takers,
 right?


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 are
 um
 you


know,
 basically
 want
 the
 price
 of
 their


of
 the
 asset
 to
 reflect
 the
 risk
 that


they're
 taking.
 And
 so,
 you're
 going
 to


get
 these
 instantaneous
 shifts
 in


expectations.
 When
 you
 get
 a
 news
 event,


when
 you
 get
 a
 headline
 from,
 you
 know,


Donald
 Trump
 and
 you
 think
 that
 maybe


the
 dollar
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 the


reserve
 currency
 anymore,
 that's
 going


to
 affect
 dollar
 assets
 regardless
 of


where
 they
 are
 in
 the
 world.
