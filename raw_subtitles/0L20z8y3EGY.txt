10th anniversary
"Interstellar" returns to the big screen
Today I am going to go into the movie analysis of "Interstellar Effect"
The story of "Interstellar Effect" tells the story of the Earth in 2067
Food crisis caused by climate disasters and crop diseases
Humanity faces the possibility of extinction
The heroine Murphy discovered an anomaly in gravity one day in her study.
Following the binary coordinates of gravity with father Cooper
Accidentally came to NASA’s secret base
Learned about the alien colonization plan
To save humanity on Earth from extinction
Cooper leaves home to find a second home for humanity
Started a space adventure
story begins
We see a future world similar to that predicted by Malthus
Fusarium wilt kills crops
There is not enough food to feed the world’s population
This is not a plot only for science fiction movies
Scientists estimate that 50% of cultivated foods on Earth have been wiped out by blight
For example, the bananas eaten by people in the 18th century were wiped out by blight in the 1950s.
The bananas we eat now are actually a specially bred variety (Cavendish banana)
So the future predicted by "Interstellar Effect" is not unfounded
in order to cope with this crisis
NASA commissions Cooper to serve as pilot for space immigration program
Cooper must choose to stay on Earth
Or leave your family to save the lifeblood of humanity?
Like Nolan's past films, the protagonist must face various moral dilemmas
Batman must choose to reveal the truth
Plunging Gotham City into chaos
Still have to sacrifice personal interests
Use lies to maintain order in Gotham City
In "Interstellar Effect"
Every character faces the same dilemma
Professor Brandon, in order to save the human species and satisfy the public interest
He doesn't hesitate to lie about having a plan A
Sacrifice Cooper's personal interests
Professor Brandon's daughter Emilia
In order to see my lover Edmunds again
Making a self-serving judgment may cause the entire mission to fail.
Mann falsified information in order to satisfy his selfish desire to survive.
Use false information to mislead others to his planet
we will find
These conflicts between personal interests and public interests
In fact, it all comes from the lack of knowledge
Because of the lack of quantum gravity information in black holes
Professor Brandon's Plan A formula just can't be completed
This was Cooper's first misjudgment
Because the time shift difference close to the "Giant" black hole was not calculated
The team chose Miller's planet incorrectly
This was Cooper's second misjudgment
Because he misunderstood Mann's falsified data.
The team made the wrong choice of Mann's planet again
This was Cooper's third misjudgment
These erroneous judgments appear to stem from a lack of knowledge.
But "Interstellar Effect" ended up reaching the completely opposite conclusion.
The unknown is not an obstacle to action
and it happens to constitute part of human action
The most critical unknown throughout the entire movie
It's the ghost in Murphy's study
movie begins
Murphy told his father
The ghost in the study wants to communicate with him
cooper as scientist
Choose purely scientific explanations
Think this is just the gravity effect of objective reality
But Murphy thinks
Natural forces cannot fully explain phenomena
Behind this power is a communication ability similar to human rationality
This makes Murphy a bit like Socrates
Socrates also often said that a spirit was communicating with him
This led to him being accused of heresy by the Athenian court
And Murphy was also regarded as a heretic within the school system.
When teacher tried to cover up US moon landing history
Murphy brought old textbooks to challenge authority
Before Cooper leaves Earth
Murphy again appeals to ghost agency
But Cooper still thinks ghosts are just gravity
I don’t believe there is any subjective initiative behind this
Finally realized
It turns out that this seemingly unknown external force
In fact, it is created by the subject himself
Different from previous space movies
Treat advanced life on alien planets as some unknown other
"Interstellar Effect" takes a bolder turn here
The power that people exert
Mistakenly thought to be some unknown supernatural force
here
We see what quantum mechanics philosopher Karen Barad calls “active realism.”
Humans who try to use science to understand natural phenomena
We often forget that we are also part of nature
Man does not understand nature from outside of nature
In experiments in quantum mechanics
When you want to observe the position of electrons
We must shine a beam of light
But once you irradiate it with photons
Light imparts momentum to electrons
The electrons ran away
The very act of measuring changes natural phenomena
Nature, the universe, and all things are not external, isolated objective realities.
Human actions themselves will interact with natural attributes and in turn change reality.
In "Interstellar Effect"
The ghost in the study was originally thought to be some kind of external supernatural force
The lie of Plan A is also based on the ignorance of the protagonist.
But these unknown elements allow the protagonist to go on a space adventure
Instead, it accidentally allowed him to obtain quantum gravity information in the black hole.
Finally discovered that ghostly external force
In fact, it is the realization of one’s own power
Human agency in turn shapes reality itself
Let the fiction (Plan A) that did not exist before become reality
active realism
It goes back to La Jetée, another important film that inspired Interstellar
The story of La Jetée takes place after World War III
The surviving people invented a technology
Allows people to go back to the past and future
Find out how to avoid war
Scientists experiment on prison inmates
Man selected for retaining vivid childhood memories
He remembers a man dying on the observation deck and a woman standing over there
This man traveled back in time after becoming a subject
Met a lady
The two fell in love
This girl calls this future person her "ghost"
The male protagonist later went to the future
Found a solution to save the world
But after the task is completed
The prisoner is about to be executed
It's so dangerous that someone from the future comes to the rescue.
Take him through time and space
He decided to go back to his childhood
Only then did I discover
It turns out that the girl on the observation deck I saw in my childhood
It's the person he fell in love with when he traveled through time
He immediately ran towards her
Unexpectedly, he was shot and killed by a killer sent from the prison.
A man died on the observation deck, a woman stood next to him
It turns out that this childhood scene is not some reality external to the protagonist.
It’s the reality that the protagonist’s actions across time and space interact with.
In fact, in the original script for Interstellar Effect
The ending originally set by Nolan's brother Johnathan was
After Cooper finished transmitting the message
Will be trapped in hypercube space and die
There is no plot to reunite with my daughter.
Because in physics
Once you enter a black hole, it's almost impossible to get out.
This provides us with another possibility of interpretation
What happens after falling into a black hole
Maybe it was just a dream Cooper had before he died.
like the opening of a movie
It was also a dream in which Cooper crashed while testing a plane for NASA.
Such an ending can better echo the beginning and the end
Many space adventure movies in film history
The protagonists are also unable to distinguish between fantasy and reality in the end.
But Nolan changed the ending
Let Cooper be saved by someone from the future
This is actually inspired by Edwin Abbott's novel "Flatland" (1844)
This novel describes a square creature living in a two-dimensional world
One day there was a spherical creature who lived in the third dimension
Entered his world
From a two-dimensional perspective
A square will see a circle suddenly appear out of thin air
Finally, suddenly disappeared into thin air
This spherical creature decided to take Square to the three-dimensional world to open his eyes.
Finally, put it back into the 2D plane world
"Interstellar Effect" actually takes the story of Flatland to another dimension.
Let the five-dimensional creatures
Create a four-dimensional hypercube space
Traveling through the three-dimensional human world
It will look like this
Three-dimensional humans will suddenly see something
Then suddenly disappeared
But Nolan added new elements to the story of Flatland.
What truly transcends these dimensions is the love between father and daughter
through science fiction
"Interstellar Effect" asks us a more fundamental question
What is the essence of love?
Cooper provides the same answer as Adam Smith
Love is just a social benefit
Adam Smith believed
Human love and sympathy are actually moral emotions
Prompt people to do ethical and altruistic things
After the loved one benefits
In turn, he will help those who love him
Seemingly altruistic behavior
will ultimately lead to self-interested benefits
This moral emotion is the basis of social prosperity
Contemporary evolutionary biologists follow this line of thinking
Thinking that feelings of love are just the work of "selfish genes"
It is the survival instinct of the species that drives humans to feel love
The purpose is to allow the human species to reproduce
But this utilitarian view
But was challenged by Dr. Brand
If love is only based on some benefit considerations
That actually cannot explain many phenomena of love.
Like some people are willing to sacrifice for love
Love even to the point of self-destruction
Brand's love for Edmunds
Let her disregard the future of the entire human species
I also want to go to his planet to meet him.
Brand’s love not only has no social benefits
It also defeats the purpose of continuing the human species.
Brand spoke about the philosophy of love by the philosopher Dietrich von Hildebrand
Hildebrand thinks
The essence of love is neither self-interest nor altruism
But human self-transcendence
one feels love for someone
It’s because you see some precious and good qualities in your lover
This quality has intrinsic value in itself
One can therefore love this trait more than oneself
Willing to compromise and sacrifice for love beyond consideration of interests
Love gives human beings a certain transcendence
in western philosophy
Only God can fully embody this transcendence
God is beyond time and space
Unlike humans who are subject to various physical limitations
If everyone is born with the desire for love
It means that everyone has some transcendent potential
Which brings us to the key theme of Star Effect
What is the relationship between humans and transcendence?
In the history of science fiction movies
Earth and Space
often symbolizes the opposition between nature and human transcendence
In "2001: A Space Odyssey"
Human beings evolved from the earth
Initially limited by the natural environment of the earth
In the end, he progressed to inventing spaceships
Beyond the limitations of the earth, leaving the earth
A new species is born in outer space
Technology allows humans to create their own environment in outer space
As if becoming a being beyond human beings
become closer to god
In "Interstellar Effect"
Cooper initially denied the earth and yearned for space.
The NASA program Cooper participated in was named Lazarus
Lazarus is the name in the New Testament
Disciples who died and were resurrected by Jesus
Implying that this plan is like a miracle
Will allow humans to be reborn on other planets
But after entering Miller's planet
Humanity's plan to become a god has been thwarted
Gravity close to a black hole causes time to slow down
Only then did Cooper realize the cost of pursuing transcendence.
Cooper, who has lost decades here
Feeling what Hannah Orland calls "Earth alienation"
The Soviet Vostok 1 spacecraft landed in space in 1957
Yuri Gagarin becomes the first man in space
For the first time in history, humans are no longer bound by Earth's gravity
Can continue to explore outwards
People on Earth celebrate the coming era of human conquest of space.
But Hannah Oran thinks
Hidden behind this is the alienation between man and the earth
social community created by people
Life must be meaningful if you live with others
The earth is the condition for people to breathe, live and move.
Earth's gravity appears to be an environmental limitation that must be transcended
But on the other hand, it is also a gift to mankind.
It happens to be because the earth has just the right gravity constant
Only then is it possible for human beings to establish civilization
If the Earth's gravity is too strong or too weak
Life may not appear on Earth at all
In the movie "Gravity"
We see the consequences of humanity's escape from gravity
The heroine who enters the spaceship
like a newborn embryo
It seems that space technology is enough to allow human beings to be reborn in outer space
But it didn't take long
The spacecraft was destroyed by space junk
The protagonist realizes how difficult it is to survive without gravity
After finally surviving and returning to Earth
I am even more grateful that gravity has grasped human beings to the earth.
And in "Interstellar Effect"
The Earth's gravity was initially seen as a nuisance that had to be controlled
That's why Plan A doesn't work
But when people leave the earth
Affected by the gravity of the black hole, living a different time from the people on earth
Only then did people realize
The reason why people on earth can have synchronized time
It's because we share the same gravity
The earth’s gravity field actually gives human society “synchronicity”
The alienation between man and the earth breaks this synchronicity
Created a time difference that is irreparable to humans
etc.
What exactly is time?
In "Interstellar Effect"
We see two different views of time
One is in a hypercube
Time regarded as the fourth dimension
One is to live in time
time as perceived subjectively
These two views of time
It reflects the debate between Einstein and the philosopher Bergson on the nature of time.
Einstein believed that space is three-dimensional
And time is actually the fourth dimension
But Bergson thinks
Physicist speaking time
It's like the earth goes around the sun once a year
One minute is one revolution of the watch's second hand
These are just using space to understand time
Bergson asks us to imagine
Melt a piece of sugar cube in water
Scientists calculate how long it takes a sugar cube to dissolve
Think that this way you can understand what time is
But people are different from sugar cubes
People have consciousness and memory
People grow up in the flow of time
will create some memories
Memories of this time
In fact, it will in turn shape how he perceives time.
It’s just that few people notice it
Past memories hidden in the present
This sense of time that cannot be measured scientifically
is the essence of time
On the other hand
If a person loses the ability to make memories
The ability to perceive time will also be lost.
Just like Leonard, the male protagonist in "Memory Puzzle"
Because of amnesia
Unable to create new short-term memory
His sense of time is different from that of ordinary people
It’s like living in the present tense forever
Always stuck in the memory of wanting to avenge his wife
"Interstellar Effect" uses a stronger contrast to reveal the relationship between time and memory
The 23 years lost on Miller's planet are a measurable objective time
To Murphy on Earth, his father has disappeared for 23 years.
But for Cooper
during this time
He was supposed to be involved in his son and daughter's past
But they lost the opportunity to create memories with their children
like this time
He has lost his memory of what happened on Earth
The memory still stays at the time point 23 years ago
Only through the past images of children
Recollect the lost decades
This clip is like a microcosm of contemporary society
Many people work in other places to work
Sacrificing time with family
After returning home for a long time
I just realized that my family has suddenly become older.
Leaving home feels like arriving on another planet
lived a different time
This time metaphor
It is also reflected in the moment when Cooper docked the Ever Given.
The design of the Ever Given is a circle with 12 components connected in series
like the 12 scales of a clock
It's like Cooper lost 23 years of his life
Desire to connect back to Earth’s time
time travel movies from the past
They all involve the protagonist going back to the past or the future.
The protagonist can travel to any time and space he wants
transcendent like a god
But Kip Thorne, a physics consultant for interstellar effects, made a more nuanced set.
It’s not Cooper who can truly travel freely to the past.
It's a binary message transmitted by gravity.
The freedom of time travel is limited to my daughter’s room
Cooper cannot travel into his past
Otherwise
He can return to Miller's planet before the mission failed.
Save the time he lost
This setting makes "Interstellar Effect" different from other time travel movies
Even if Cooper can save the world from destruction
He can't prevent his decades of life from being destroyed by a black hole
Although Cooper is the hero of the people on earth
But still a prisoner of time
He will still grow old according to time
Destined to have jet lag with my daughter
But because of this
Cooper must return to Earth within a limited time
Only then can I see my daughter for the last time
Philosopher Martin Hägglund believes that
The finite nature of existence is actually the most precious thing for human beings
Because if people don't die
Can exist eternally like God
beyond time and space
Then there is nothing that must be done now
You can always wait until the future to do it
In "Full Start"
The hero's wife in his dream is an immortal and eternal existence
Time has no effect on her
The protagonist can go back to the dream to meet her again an unlimited number of times
Or in "Top Showdown"
Magician uses Tesla electricity to create infinite clones
Appear in different places at the same time
Can die an infinite number of times
Like an immortal existence
And in "True Love Every Day"
The hero's family has the ability to travel through time and space
Like a god, you can freely choose the past you want to travel to.
Just before his death, the father returns to childhood with the protagonist again
Relive father and son moments
In these examples
Humanity has aspired to God-like infinity, rejecting the finitude of existence
But Hägglund thinks
The finitude of existence is not a limitation
On the contrary, it is a possibility of freedom
Let us turn to "secular beliefs":
Realize that the most precious thing in the world is not money
not a crop
not scientific truth
It’s the time we can live to be with others
Precisely because people will die as they age
So there are some things I must accomplish in my limited life
My freedom lies in how I use the limited time in this life
In "Startup Source Code"
The male protagonist who is on the verge of brain death is assigned to a simulation system
Catch the terrorist on the train
after completing the task
Before dying, the protagonist asked to enter the simulation system again
Use the remaining time to live for yourself
In "True Love Everyday"
The hero finally discovers the secret to happiness
In fact, it means not using the ability to travel through time and space.
It's just because I know the opportunities are limited and I can't do it again
This kind of life is valuable
The finitude of existence and time
thus giving our actions the possibility of meaning
It is precisely because the ecological load of the earth has a limit
It's worth taking action
Buy more time for life in the future era
Secular beliefs make me care more about the world
rather than escaping from this world
Precisely because I know my time is limited
Every action I take becomes urgent
I have to create more time for myself
Secular beliefs therefore make me appreciate every decision in life more
It's because I know that other people's lives are just as limited as mine
So we must act while the people we care about still exist.
Our actions are meaningful
Secular beliefs therefore make me care more about my responsibilities and commitments to others
Secular belief in human finitude
can become a driving force to transform this world
Let us do it before it's too late
To protect the most precious thing in the universe
The only time in our lives
