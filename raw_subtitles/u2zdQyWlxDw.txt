3,000 farmers supported.
Six million dollars
in direct income to farmers.
50 tons of food waste
prevented every month.
These numbers represent FarmWorks’s
impact over the last five years.
But what if I tell you
they are no longer the most
important metrics to me anymore?
Today, the number one metric
that I care about as CEO of FarmWorks
is our profitability.
Now before you judge me and think,
"How did we let
this capitalist on the stage?"
hear me out.
Five years ago, I cofounded FarmWorks
with the grand mission
to build 1,000 climate-smart,
highly productive farms across Kenya.
We invested in water dams, net houses,
drip irrigation, organic fertilizers.
We had every right
climate solution by the book.
But then, harvest time came,
and I realized, when walking
into our grading shed,
there were crates of tomatoes rotting away
because we didn't have enough orders.
Our storage room was bursting with onions.
It looks almost funny, but I was standing
there, thinking, "Great, now what?"
At the end of the day, every farmer
has to answer one question:
"Who is going to buy my produce
and pay for all my hard work
and investment?"
Without the financial outcomes,
climate initiatives
cannot sustain themselves.
This lesson hit me particularly hard
a few years ago during one
of our investor visits.
The investor asked our group of farmers,
"So how do you like working
with FarmWorks so far?"
One farmer said,
"Yeah, we like them a lot so far.
But you see, every two years,
there is a new organization coming to us
with a new project.
They disappear after two years,
so we will see how long
FarmWorks can last."
I felt my stomach drop in that moment.
These farmers have gotten used
to countless NGOs, donors,
start-ups rolling in with grand
climate visions, big promises,
only to vanish when funding dries up.
And without the financial sustainability,
we, too, would be gone
in just a few seasons.
In that moment, finding financial
sustainability for FarmWorks
meant we had to sell all of our produce.
So that's when I threw myself
into Kenya's vegetable wholesale market.
This is 5am at the Marikiti,
one of the largest wholesale markets
in downtown Nairobi.
It was chaotic.
So many sellers fighting
for the best spot to sell.
The customers are fighting
for the highest-quality crate of tomatoes.
And I'm Chinese, so I'm very much used
to crowds and competition.
But this was next level.
(Laughter)
I immediately knew I had to be part
of this excitement.
I started delivering tomatoes
with our trucks to the markets,
and on my first day, I got pushed down
to the ground by a market vendor.
Not exactly the welcome I was expecting.
But over the years,
I learned to be part of the market.
I figured out how prices actually work,
how weather can totally
change supply and demand overnight,
and made friends with the market ladies,
many of them now our customers,
proudly selling produce from FarmWorks.
With the market figured out,
we were able to sell almost everything.
In fact, we realized that our own
farms could never be enough
to meet the full demand.
In the end, people are eating
every day of the year,
but no farmer can be harvesting
365 days of the year.
So we decided to partner
with more farmers,
starting by training them
with climate-smart techniques.
And this is what surprised me.
When we give farmers drip irrigation kits,
sometimes they sit unused.
When we showed them the more hygienic
crop-support structures,
they were still using the same old method.
It was hard to admit,
but the reality is we were
imposing solutions
but not really solving problems.
The drip irrigation could save water
but costs fuel to operate.
The more hygienic crop support
structure might prevent disease
but costs money to buy.
We were providing knowledge,
but not really capital
or guaranteed returns.
And without enough financial incentives,
the farmers cannot really afford
to implement those good ideas.
So we changed our approach.
Instead of focusing on training,
we simply started buying
and distributing the farmers' produce,
and giving them a real income.
What happened next shocked me even more,
because with the income from us,
the farmers actually started
to invest in better practices,
better equipment,
investing in their own farms.
So turns out the right economics
was more powerful
than the right knowledge.
And you know what else?
Supposedly, young people
are not very interested in agriculture.
That is not true.
Young people in Kenya love agriculture.
But what they love even more
is to have a decent job
and earn a decent income.
At FarmWorks, more than 80 percent
of our employees
are under the age of 30.
We are an agriculture business
made by young talent.
Over the years, we have grown
into one of the largest
vegetable wholesalers in Kenya.
In 2024, we sold 100 million tomatoes.
That might sound like a lot. (Laughs)
(Applause)
Until you do the math.
It's barely two tomatoes
per person in Kenya.
So we still have a lot of room to grow
and a long way to go.
And remember my original dream
of building 1,000 farms.
That is still being realized,
but in a different way.
Today, the farms
are being built not by us
but by the farmers,
who know their own land
and communities the best.
With steady market uptake
and consistent income from us,
they are now able
to invest in their own farms
and reach out to us when they need help.
Finding financial
sustainability was not easy.
For years after finding our market,
we were still bleeding money.
I had to make difficult decisions
of shutting down
prized demonstration farms,
halting new partnerships,
even closing regions
that were too far away for us to serve.
Turns out it was really difficult
to save money, compared to spending it.
But I knew the only way for us
to survive and grow our impact
is through finding
financial sustainability.
Today, we're a business
with healthy margins and growth.
More than 300 employees work for us,
and more than 10,000 market vendors
rely on us for their daily supplies.
The hard lesson I learned from the years
of being a social entrepreneur
is that real sustainability,
climate or otherwise,
must come from economics first.
I'm not talking about choosing
profit over planet,
but I have recognized
that without a viable economics,
our climate projects and initiatives
might remain as expensive experiments
but not really scalable solutions.
Think about it.
When farmers earn an income,
they can invest in better practices.
When companies achieve profitability,
we can protect and scale our impact.
When communities prosper economically,
they're able and can afford to care
about their environment in the long term.
So here is my message.
The best thing we can do for our climate
is to build economically viable solutions.
Let there be economics first.
Then, and only then, can we unlock real,
lasting climate impact.
Thank you.
(Cheers and applause)
