What's
 the
 two-minute
 rule?
 Take


whatever
 habit
 you're
 trying
 to
 focus
 on


and
 scale
 it
 down
 to
 something
 that


takes
 2
 minutes
 or
 less
 to
 do.
 You
 know,


I
 have
 this
 reader.
 He
 started
 going
 to


the
 gym
 and
 he
 lost
 over
 100
 lbs.
 It's


kept
 off
 for
 more
 than
 a
 decade
 now.
 But


when
 he
 first
 started
 to
 go,
 he
 had
 a


rule
 where
 he
 wasn't
 allowed
 to
 stay
 at


the
 gym
 for
 longer
 than
 5
 minutes,


right?
 It
 sounds
 like
 kind
 of


ridiculous.
 Like,
 oh,
 clearly
 this
 is


not
 going
 to
 get
 the
 guy
 the
 results
 he


wants.
 What
 you
 realize
 is
 he
 was


mastering
 the
 art
 of
 showing
 up.
 A
 habit


must
 be
 established
 before
 it
 can
 be


improved.
 You
 need
 to
 standardize
 before


you
 optimize.


>> And
 then
 once
 we've
 identified
 a
 habit


that
 we
 want
 to
 replace
 or
 eliminate,


what
 is
 the
 mechanism
 by
 which
 we
 can
 do


that?


>> Broadly
 speaking,
 I
 think
 there
 are
 four


things
 that
 you
 should
 do
 if
 you
 want
 to


build
 a
 habit.
 And
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


best
 things
 you
 can
 do
 early
 on,
 this
 is


if
 I
 could
 actually
 add
 one
 thing
 to


atomic
 habits
 that
 wasn't
 in
 it,
 it


would
 probably
 be
 this.


What
 is
 the
 role
 that
 identity
 plays
 in


terms
 of
 habit
 formation?


>> Ultimately,
 I
 feel
 like
 identity
 may
 be


the
 most
 important
 thing
 with
 habits.


Um,


your
 habits
 are
 how
 you
 embody
 a


particular
 identity.
 So,
 when
 you
 make


your
 bed,
 you
 embody
 the
 identity
 of


someone
 who
 is
 clean
 and
 organized.
 If


you
 study
 biology
 for
 20
 minutes
 on


Tuesday
 night,
 you
 embody
 the
 identity


of
 someone
 who
 is
 studious.
 The
 act
 of


doing
 it
 is
 proof
 that
 you
 are
 that
 type


of
 person.
 And
 eventually
 you
 start
 to


build
 up
 this
 body
 of
 evidence
 for
 being


that
 way.
 You
 have
 every
 reason
 in
 the


world
 to
 believe
 it.
 So
 one
 of
 the
 core


lessons
 of
 atomic
 habits
 is
 that
 every


action
 you
 take
 is
 like
 a
 vote
 for
 the


type
 of
 person
 you
 wish
 to
 become.
 So,


when
 you
 show
 up
 at
 the
 gym
 today,
 you


are
 casting
 a
 vote
 for
 being
 the
 type
 of


person
 who
 doesn't
 miss
 workouts.
 When


you
 sit
 down
 and
 make
 one
 sales
 call,


you
 are
 casting
 a
 vote
 for
 being
 a


salesperson.
 When
 you
 write
 one


sentence,
 you
 are
 casting
 a
 vote
 for


being
 a
 writer.
 And
 no,
 doing
 one


push-up
 does
 not
 transform
 your
 body,


but
 it
 does
 cast
 a
 vote
 for
 that


identity.
 It
 does
 provide
 evidence
 for


being
 that
 type
 of
 person.
 And


eventually,
 as
 you
 build
 up
 that
 body
 of


evidence,
 you
 start
 to
 take
 pride
 in


being
 that
 way.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 where


you
 get
 to
 this
 really
 resilient
 place


in
 terms
 of
 building
 your
 habits.
 When


you
 start
 to
 take
 pride
 in
 being
 that


type
 of
 person,
 you
 will
 fight
 to


maintain
 the
 habit.
 You
 know,
 it
 becomes


the
 opposite
 situation.
 Now,
 instead
 of


trying
 to
 force
 yourself
 to
 do
 it,


you're
 trying
 to
 maintain
 it
 uh
 because


it's
 a
 part
 of
 your
 identity
 that
 you


believe
 in
 and
 that
 you,
 you
 know,
 want


to
 to
 keep.
 You
 know,
 if
 you
 take
 pride


in
 the
 size
 of
 your
 biceps,
 you
 never


skip
 arm
 day
 at
 the
 gym.
 Now,
 if
 you


take
 pride
 in
 how
 your
 hair
 looks,
 you


have
 this
 long
 hair
 care
 routine,
 you
 do


it
 every
 day.
 we
 wouldn't
 know
 but
 you


know
 it's
 like
 um
 and
 so
 um


really
 the
 goal
 is
 not
 to
 read
 a
 book


the
 goal
 is
 to
 become
 a
 reader
 you
 know


the
 goal
 is
 not
 to
 run
 a
 marathon
 it's


to
 become
 a
 runner
 the
 goal
 is
 not
 to
 do


some
 silent
 meditation
 retreat
 it's
 to


become
 a
 meditator
 it's
 to
 install
 and


adopt
 this
 identity
 that
 this
 is
 the


type
 of
 person
 that
 I
 am
 and
 I
 think


ultimately
 that's
 why
 small
 habits


matter
 so
 much
 you
 know
 behavior
 and


belief
 is
 like
 two-way
 street.
 You
 know,


what
 you
 believe
 will
 influence
 the


actions
 that
 you
 take,
 but
 the
 actions


that
 you
 take
 can
 also
 influence
 what


you
 believe
 about
 yourself.
 And
 you


know,
 every
 time
 you
 show
 up
 and
 do
 it


in
 some
 small
 way,
 you
 prove
 to
 yourself


a
 little
 bit,
 hey,
 maybe
 I
 am
 that
 kind


of
 person.
 And
 so,
 my
 encouragement,
 my


suggestion
 is
 to
 let
 the
 behavior
 lead


the
 way.
 To
 start
 with
 some
 small
 action


and
 then
 prove
 to
 yourself
 in
 your
 in


that
 moment
 that
 you
 were
 that
 kind
 of


person.
 And
 as
 you
 start
 to
 foster
 and


build
 that
 identity,
 um,
 sticking
 with


the
 habit
 becomes
 easier.


>> I
 I
 like
 the
 idea
 of
 the
 small,
 you
 had


1%
 better
 in
 your
 book,
 too.
 Y,


>> uh,
 these
 small
 changes
 leading
 to
 big


results.
 I
 think
 where
 people
 go
 astray


>> is
 the
 lack
 of
 patience
 sort
 of
 changes


the
 outcome.
 So,
 I
 know
 I
 want
 to
 be


healthier,
 but
 I
 know
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 work


and
 a
 lot
 of
 time.
 If
 I
 eat
 healthier,
 I


go
 to
 the
 gym
 more.
 I
 I
 just
 live
 a


healthier
 lifestyle.
 And
 that's
 where
 we


get
 in
 trouble,
 but
 we
 do
 it
 with


everything.
 It's
 not
 just


>> lack
 of
 patience
 changes
 the
 outcome.


That's
 a
 good
 phrase.
 Um
 it's
 definitely


true.
 I
 think
 there
 are
 two
 ways
 people


can
 go
 astray.
 So
 there's
 there's
 what


you
 just
 mentioned,
 which
 is
 not
 being


patient
 enough
 and
 sticking
 with
 it.


We'll
 talk
 about
 that
 in
 a
 minute.
 The


other
 one
 is
 um
 small
 changes
 can
 really


matter,
 but
 only
 if
 they're
 oriented
 in


the
 right
 way.
 You
 know,
 we
 we
 know
 we


all
 know
 people
 who
 spend
 time
 on


minutia
 and
 trivial
 things.
 You
 know,


you
 kind
 of
 waste
 time
 on
 small
 stuff


that
 doesn't
 really
 matter.
 And
 I
 think


one
 of
 the
 distinctions
 is
 are
 your


small
 actions
 accumulating
 or
 are
 they


evaporating?
 You
 know,
 are
 you
 doing


small
 things
 each
 day
 that
 are
 oriented


toward
 a
 larger
 outcome
 or
 are
 you
 doing


small
 things
 each
 day
 that
 are
 just
 kind


of
 like
 one-offs
 and
 don't
 really
 add


up?
 In
 a
 lot
 of
 ways,
 I
 feel
 like
 the


two
 time
 frames
 that
 matter
 most
 in
 life


are
 10
 years
 and
 1
 hour,
 you
 know?
 So,


like
 10
 years
 is
 just
 shorthand
 for
 the


big
 meaningful
 things
 that
 you
 want
 to


do
 in
 life.
 Where
 do
 you
 want
 to
 be
 in
 a


decade?
 You
 know,
 I
 sometimes
 I
 like
 to


encourage
 people
 to
 don't
 let
 a
 day
 pass


without
 doing
 something
 that
 will


benefit
 you
 in
 a
 decade.
 Um,
 and
 one


hour
 is
 how
 can
 I
 do
 something
 today


right
 now
 that
 is
 oriented
 toward
 where


I
 want
 to
 be
 in
 10
 years.
 And
 if
 you
 can


kind
 of
 live
 in
 that
 simultaneously
 in


those
 two
 modes
 of
 thought,
 if
 you
 can


both
 be
 thinking
 long
 term
 but
 acting


short
 term,
 then
 you
 start
 looking
 for


little
 changes,
 little
 adjustments
 that


do
 add
 up,
 that
 do
 accumulate,
 that
 are


not
 trivial
 and,
 you
 know,
 um,


meaningless.
 So,
 um,
 I
 think
 that's
 one


way
 people
 go
 astray
 is
 their
 their


small
 actions
 are
 not
 oriented
 toward


the
 larger
 outcome.
 They're
 not


accumulating.
 The
 second
 way
 that
 they


go
 astray
 is
 what
 you
 just
 mentioned,


which
 is
 um
 lack
 of
 patience
 changes
 the


outcome.
 I
 one
 of
 the
 examples
 I
 give
 in


atomic
 habits
 is
 thinking
 about
 an
 ice


cube,
 you
 know.
 So
 you
 walk
 into
 a
 room,


it's
 cold,
 you
 can
 see
 your
 breath,
 and


the
 ice
 cube
 sitting
 on
 the
 table,
 you


start
 heating
 the
 room
 up
 one
 degree,


another
 degree,
 another
 degree,
 ice


cube's
 still
 there,
 and
 eventually
 you


get
 to
 this
 tipping
 point,
 this
 phase


transition.
 The
 ice
 cube
 starts
 to
 melt.


It's
 this
 like
 onederee
 shift,
 no


different
 than
 the
 shifts
 that
 had
 come


before,
 but
 you
 hit
 this
 transition
 and


things
 change.


>> And
 habits
 are
 like
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 the


time.
 You
 know,
 you'll
 hear
 people
 say


things
 like,
 you
 know,
 I've
 been
 running


for
 a
 month.
 I
 can't
 see
 a
 change
 in
 my


body.
 Or,
 we've
 been
 meeting
 every


Friday
 for
 6
 months
 and
 we
 still
 haven't


shipped
 this
 feature
 yet.
 And
 it's
 like,


yeah,
 that
 work
 is
 not
 being
 wasted.


It's
 just
 being
 stored.
 You
 know,
 it's


kind
 of
 like
 complaining
 about
 heating


an
 ice
 cube
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 it
 not


melting
 yet.
 It's
 like,
 well,
 you
 just


haven't
 hit
 the
 phase
 transition.
 So,


but
 that's
 where
 people
 give
 up.


>> Yes.
 Yes.
 I
 The
 San
 Antonio
 Spurs
 have


uh
 a
 quote
 hanging
 in
 their
 locker
 room


where
 it
 says,
 you
 know,
 they've
 won


five
 NBA
 championships.


And
 it
 says,
 "When
 I
 think
 about
 giving


up,
 I
 think
 about
 the
 stone
 cutter
 who


takes
 his
 hammer
 and
 bangs
 on
 the
 rock
 a


hundred
 times
 without
 it
 splitting
 in


two.
 And
 at
 the
 101st
 blow,
 it
 cracks.


And
 I
 know
 that
 it
 wasn't
 the
 101st
 that


did
 it,
 but
 all
 the
 hundred
 that
 came


before."
 And
 so
 many
 in
 things
 in
 life


are
 like
 that.
 You
 know,
 it's
 not
 the


last
 workout
 that
 got
 you
 fit.
 It's
 all


the
 hundred
 that
 came
 before.
 It's
 not


the
 last
 sentence
 that
 finishes
 the


novel.
 It's
 all
 the
 hundred
 that
 came


before.
 It's
 not
 the
 last
 conversation


that
 closes
 the
 sale.
 It's
 all
 the


hundred
 that
 came
 before.
 It's
 this


willingness
 to
 keep
 showing
 up
 and


hammering
 on
 the
 rock
 and
 knowing
 that


at
 some
 point
 you
 are
 going
 to
 hit
 that


phase
 transition.
 You
 are
 going
 to
 hit


that,
 you
 know,
 that
 new
 um
 level,
 but


you
 need
 enough
 persistence
 to
 keep


doing
 it.


>> Are
 there
 tips
 or
 tricks
 you
 have?


Because
 like
 when
 I'm
 working
 out,
 I'm


getting
 better,
 but
 I'm
 getting
 better


internally.
 I
 just
 don't
 I
 can't
 visual.


It's
 not
 visible,


>> but
 it
 is
 in
 like
 I
 can't
 see
 it,
 but


it's
 happening.
 Yes.
 Are
 there
 tips
 or


tricks
 you
 have
 that
 we
 can


>> uh
 use
 either
 psychologically
 or


practically
 speaking?


>> This
 is
 one
 of
 the
 big
 lessons
 for


habits,
 which
 is
 just
 because


improvements
 aren't
 noticeable.
 Doesn't


mean
 improvement
 isn't
 happening.
 You


know,
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 see
 a
 change


on
 the
 scale
 every
 time
 you
 work
 out.


You're
 not
 going
 to
 see
 a
 change
 in
 the


number
 of
 subscribers
 every
 time
 you


publish
 an
 episode
 or
 whatever.
 Like,


it's,
 you
 know,
 it
 takes
 a
 while.
 Um,


but
 the
 tricky
 part
 is
 if
 something's


not
 working,
 it
 also
 takes
 a
 while.
 You


know,
 you
 just
 keep
 banging
 your
 head


against
 the
 wall.
 So,
 how
 do
 you
 know


when
 you
 need
 to
 be
 patient
 and
 how
 do


you
 know
 when
 you
 need
 to
 try
 something


different?
 And
 um
 sometimes
 you'll
 hear


people
 say
 like
 try
 try
 again.
 I


actually
 think
 it
 should
 be
 rephrased
 to


try
 try
 differently.
 You
 need
 to
 keep


trying,
 but
 you
 need
 to
 keep
 trying


different
 lines
 of
 attack.
 This
 is
 I


think
 Naval
 has
 something
 where
 he
 says


you
 know
 it's
 not
 10,000
 attempts
 it's


10,000
 iterations.
 You
 know
 an
 iteration


is
 a
 different
 way
 of
 doing
 it.
 So
 you


need
 you
 need
 some
 adjustment
 to
 the


approach.


>> And
 um
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 need
 to
 do
 it


10,000
 times.
 Usually
 just
 doing
 it
 five


different
 ways
 or
 10
 different
 ways
 is


enough
 to
 see
 oh
 one
 of
 these
 is
 working


better
 than
 the
 other.
 So
 this
 is
 the


this
 is
 the
 second
 kind
 of
 insight
 which


is
 when
 something
 goes
 well
 usually
 it


goes
 pretty
 well
 from
 the
 beginning.


It's
 not.
 Now,
 that
 does
 not
 what
 that


does
 not
 mean
 is
 that
 you'll
 always
 have


the
 results
 you
 want
 right
 away
 or
 that


you
 will
 immediately
 get
 the
 outcome


that
 you're
 you're
 hoping
 for.
 But
 what


it
 does
 mean
 is
 that
 you
 should
 this
 was


one
 of
 the
 best
 pieces
 of
 advice
 given


to
 me
 early
 in
 my
 entrepreneurial


career.
 Somebody
 told
 me
 you
 should
 try


things
 until
 something
 comes
 easily.


>> Now,
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 it
 will
 be


easy,
 but
 it
 does
 mean
 that
 it
 results


will
 come
 easier
 than
 the
 other
 things


that
 you
 have
 been
 trying.
 And
 so
 in
 a


lot
 of
 ways
 I
 think
 what
 you
 kind
 of
 one


of
 the
 big
 quests
 for
 life
 is
 to


experiment
 enough
 to
 find
 what
 comes


easy
 for
 you


>> and
 then
 work
 really
 hard
 on
 what
 comes


easy
 because
 if
 you
 work
 hard
 on
 the


thing
 that
 you
 have
 some
 skill
 set
 for


some
 strength
 for
 some
 natural
 aptitude


for
 then
 you're
 very
 hard
 to
 compete


with.
 So
 it's
 just
 your
 classic
 explore


exploit
 trade-off.
 you
 know,
 early
 in


the
 process,
 you
 need
 to
 explore
 more


and
 experiment
 more.
 And
 then
 eventually


you
 start
 to
 discover,
 okay,
 of
 the
 10


things
 I've
 tried,
 these
 are
 the
 two


that
 work
 best.
 Now
 you
 need
 to
 double


down
 on
 what's
 working
 and
 start


exploiting
 some
 of
 the
 things
 that
 um


that
 are
 actually
 getting
 you
 results.


>> Peter
 Thiel
 gave
 a
 talk
 a
 while
 ago
 and


one
 of
 the
 things
 he
 said
 that
 really


stood
 out
 to
 me
 was
 we
 underestimate


when
 something's
 working,
 we


underestimate
 how
 long
 it
 can
 go
 for
 and


how
 powerful
 it
 can
 be.
 So
 often
 we


change
 habits
 that
 are
 working
 for
 us


too
 where
 we
 change
 we
 tinker
 with


things
 that
 are
 working.


>> Man,
 there's
 so
 many
 places
 in
 life


where
 this
 is
 true.
 Like
 I
 so
 um


two
 examples,
 one
 in
 the
 gym.
 I
 have
 a


friend
 who
 was
 very
 strong,
 really
 good


lifter,
 um
 squatted
 over
 500
 lb
 and
 we


were
 training
 together
 and
 he
 was
 doing


this
 squat
 program
 and
 it
 went
 great.
 He


made
 a
 lot
 of
 progress
 over
 like
 this


three-month
 span
 and
 then
 I
 had
 to


travel
 or
 something.
 I
 didn't
 see
 him


for
 a
 little
 while,
 whatever.
 I
 I
 came


back
 maybe
 I
 saw
 him
 like
 6
 months
 later


and
 I
 said
 oh
 hey
 are
 you
 still
 doing


that
 squat
 program?
 He's
 like
 no.
 I
 was


like
 oh
 did
 it
 like
 did
 you
 stall
 out
 or


something?
 He
 was
 like
 no
 I
 just
 got


bored.
 Um
 and
 you're
 like
 man
 it
 like


all
 the
 time
 you
 know
 it
 happens


everywhere.
 People
 just
 um
 the
 quest
 the


desire
 for
 novelty
 um
 overpowers
 the
 you


know
 the
 desire
 to
 get
 results.
 It's


like
 we
 just
 can't
 keep
 sticking
 with


it.
 So,
 um,
 doubling
 down
 on
 what's


working.
 In
 a
 lot
 of
 ways,
 I
 feel
 like


the
 process
 is
 actually
 quite
 simple.


Try
 a
 number
 of
 things,
 right?
 So,


experiment
 with
 a
 number
 of
 things.
 Run


a
 number
 of
 small
 experiments.
 Once
 you


find
 something
 that
 works,
 double
 down


on
 it
 and
 then
 keep
 doing
 it
 until
 it


stops
 working,
 which
 is
 the
 step
 that
 a


lot
 of
 people
 skip.
 Um,
 and
 then
 once
 it


stops
 working,
 go
 back
 to
 the
 start
 and


try
 a
 lot
 of
 small
 experiments
 again.


And
 it's
 really
 it's
 really
 not
 more
 it


doesn't
 need
 to
 be
 more
 complicated
 than


that.
 But
 people
 shortcut
 each
 step.


They
 either
 don't
 try
 enough


experiments.
 They
 try
 one
 or
 two
 things


and
 they
 say,
 "Well,
 this
 didn't
 work


for
 me."
 You're
 like, "Well,
 it's
 not


enough
 to
 try
 two.
 Like
 maybe
 you
 need


to
 try
 20,
 you
 know."
 Um
 and
 then
 once


they
 find
 something
 that's
 working,
 they


maybe
 they
 don't
 double
 down
 on
 it


enough.
 That
 seems
 once
 you've
 tried
 a


lot
 of
 things,
 you're
 kind
 of


diversified.
 Doubling
 down
 feels
 kind
 of


risky,
 you
 know,
 to
 just
 go
 all
 in
 on


something.
 But
 you
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to


flip
 that
 switch
 and
 fully
 commit.
 And


then
 once
 you're
 fully
 committed,
 people


get
 bored
 and
 so
 they
 don't
 stick
 with


it
 until
 it
 stops
 working.
 Keep
 doing
 it


if
 it
 doesn't
 work.
 This
 is
 part
 of
 the


reason
 why
 I
 have
 not
 published
 another


book
 yet.
 Um,
 Atomic
 Habits
 is
 working


really
 well.
 And
 so
 I'm
 trying
 to
 take


my
 own
 advice
 and
 don't
 stop
 until
 it


stops
 working.
 Um,
 and
 so


>> dude,
 that
 might
 be
 forever.


>> Yeah.
 Eventually,
 eventually
 you
 realize


that
 it's
 not
 just
 about
 results,
 right?


It's
 also
 about
 how
 do
 you
 want
 to
 live


your
 life?
 What
 do
 you
 want
 to
 spend


your
 time
 on?
 Um
 but
 uh
 but
 yeah,
 so
 I


think
 those
 those
 three
 steps
 probably


should
 be
 taken
 more
 seriously
 than
 they


are.


>> How
 do
 we
 create
 an
 environment
 that


makes
 behavior
 change
 inevitable?


>> I
 think
 that's
 one
 of the
 best


questions.
 How
 can
 I
 create
 the


conditions
 for
 success?
 You
 know,
 how


can
 I
 how
 can
 I
 design
 an
 environment


where
 my
 desired
 change
 is
 easy?
 In
 a


lot
 of
 ways,
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 driving


questions
 of
 atomic
 habits
 is
 to
 say


there's
 this
 I
 came
 across
 this
 body
 of


research
 when
 I
 was
 working
 on
 the
 book


about
 willpower
 and
 self-control.


And
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 surface
 level


conversations
 about
 habits
 that
 people


have
 are
 about
 discipline
 and
 willpower.


You
 know,
 people
 will
 look
 at
 a


professional
 athlete
 and
 they'll
 say,


"Man,
 if
 I
 was
 just
 as
 disciplined
 as


them,
 but
 I,
 you
 know,
 I
 talked
 to
 one


guy
 who
 played
 for
 the
 Philadelphia


Eagles
 and
 um
 he
 said,
 you
 know,
 during


my
 career,


everything
 was
 designed
 for
 us.
 You


know,
 we
 went,
 we
 would
 go
 to
 the


stadium
 and
 we
 have
 professional


trainers
 and
 nutritionists.
 The
 food
 is


prepared
 for
 us.
 the
 you
 know
 all
 the


workouts
 are
 designed
 coaches
 are
 on
 us


every
 day
 to
 do
 the
 right
 drills
 in
 the


right
 order
 and
 to
 you
 know
 like


everything
 is
 there's
 this
 environment


where
 the
 conditions
 for
 success
 have


been
 fully
 created
 and
 he's
 like
 after
 I


retired
 that
 was
 the
 hardest
 time
 for
 me


to
 stick
 to
 it
 like
 people
 would
 look
 at


me
 as
 a
 professional
 athlete
 and
 think


wow
 how
 disciplined
 are
 you
 but
 in
 fact


you
 know
 what
 I
 was
 is
 I
 was
 benefiting


from
 my
 environment
 and
 all
 of
 us
 are


like
 that
 and
 so
 I
 I
 think
 you
 can
 look


around
 your
 own
 environment
 and
 say
 how


can
 I
 do
 a
 better
 job
 of
 creating
 the


conditions
 for
 success.
 Let's
 forget


about
 me
 being
 a
 more
 disciplined
 f


person
 or
 being,
 you
 know,
 someone
 with


superhuman
 willpower
 and
 let's
 try
 to


make
 it
 as
 easy
 as
 possible
 for
 me
 to
 do


the
 things
 I
 want
 to
 do
 each
 day.
 So,
 a


couple
 questions
 I
 think
 are
 helpful.


One
 is
 walk
 into
 the
 rooms
 where
 you


spend
 most
 of
 your
 time
 each
 day,
 your


office,
 your
 living
 room,
 your
 kitchen,


bedroom,
 and
 just
 look
 around
 and
 ask


yourself,
 what
 is
 this
 space
 designed
 to


encourage?
 You
 know,
 what
 behaviors
 are


obvious
 here?
 what
 behaviors
 are
 easy


here?
 And
 you'll
 start
 to
 notice
 that


it's
 designed
 for
 certain
 things.
 Um,


you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 feel
 like
 they


watch
 too
 much
 TV,
 but
 walk
 into
 any


living
 room,
 you
 know,
 like
 where
 do
 all


the
 couches
 and
 chairs
 face?
 What
 is


this
 room
 designed
 to
 get
 you
 to
 do?
 And


I'm
 not
 saying
 you
 need
 to
 rearrange


your
 entire
 house,
 but
 you
 know,
 you
 can


notice
 that
 if
 you
 put
 the
 healthy
 food


out
 on
 the
 counter
 and
 it's
 visible,


you're
 much
 more
 likely
 to
 eat
 it.
 Like


I
 one
 of
 the
 examples
 in
 the
 book
 is


that
 I
 used
 to
 buy
 apples
 and
 I
 would


put
 them
 in
 the
 crisper
 in
 the
 bottom
 of


the
 fridge
 and
 I
 would
 kind
 of
 like


forget
 that
 they
 were
 there.
 They
 were


just
 tucked
 away
 in
 the
 drawer
 and
 then


I'd
 find
 them
 in
 like
 a
 week
 and
 like


two
 of
 them
 had
 gone
 bad
 and
 I'm
 like


I'm
 wasting
 food
 and
 I'm
 wasting
 money.


So
 instead
 I
 just
 bought
 this
 little


display
 bowl
 and
 I
 put
 them
 in
 the


counter
 uh
 on
 the
 counter
 just
 visible


and
 now
 you
 grab
 one
 whenever
 you
 walk


in
 and
 they're
 like
 gone
 in
 two
 days.


And
 so
 it's
 just
 a
 change
 in
 the


environment.
 What
 is
 obvious?
 You
 know,


are
 you
 creating
 conditions
 where
 the


change
 that
 you
 want
 or
 the
 behavior


that
 you
 want
 is
 obvious,
 attractive,


easy,
 and
 satisfying?
 And
 the
 more
 that


you
 can
 do
 that,
 the
 more
 likely
 it
 is


that
 you'll
 follow
 through.
 You
 want
 to


you
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 walk
 into
 the


rooms
 that
 you're
 in
 each
 day,
 and
 the


good
 habit
 is
 the
 path
 of
 least


resistance.
 It's
 the
 easiest
 thing
 to


do.
 And
 a
 lot
 of the
 time
 you
 walk
 into


rooms
 and
 it's
 the
 distractions
 that
 are


easier
 to
 do
 and
 you
 feel
 like
 you're


swimming
 upstream
 and
 trying
 to
 fight


your
 environment
 to
 make
 a
 change


happen.
 So
 that
 was
 one
 question.
 What's


the
 other
 one
 you
 had
 around


environment?


>> I
 like


am
 I
 creating
 the
 conditions
 required


for
 success?
 What
 is
 this
 room
 designed


to
 encourage?
 Um
 and
 then
 how
 can
 I
 make


this
 behavior
 more
 obvious?


>> And
 there
 are
 there
 are
 a
 number
 of
 ways


that
 you
 can
 do
 that.
 Like
 some
 of
 it
 is


just,
 you
 know,
 uh
 if
 you
 want
 to
 go
 for


a
 run,
 take
 your
 running
 shoes
 and
 your


clothes,
 set
 them
 out
 the
 night
 before.


I
 have
 I
 have
 one
 guy
 who
 um
 he
 sleeps


in
 his
 running
 shorts,
 so
 he
 just
 gets


up,
 all
 he
 has
 to
 do
 is
 put
 his
 shoes


and
 a
 shirt
 on,
 then
 he's
 out
 the
 door.


You
 know,
 he's
 just
 trying
 to
 make
 it
 as


frictionless
 as
 possible.
 I
 found
 that


uh
 to
 give
 you
 like
 another
 example,
 if


I
 buy
 a
 six-ack
 of
 beer
 and
 I
 put
 it
 on


the,
 you
 know,
 shelf
 where
 I
 can
 just


see
 it
 as
 soon
 as
 I
 open
 up
 the
 door,


I'll
 grab
 one
 each
 night
 and
 have
 one
 at


dinner
 just
 cuz
 it's
 there.
 But
 if
 I


tuck
 it
 down
 on
 the
 lowest
 shelf
 and


like
 put
 it
 in
 the
 back,
 I
 gotta
 like


bend
 down
 to
 see
 it.
 Sometimes
 I'll


forget
 that
 it's
 there.
 It'll
 be
 there


for
 like
 two
 weeks,
 you
 know,
 and
 it's


just
 about
 what
 is
 obvious.
 Um
 what
 is


in
 front
 of
 you,


>> just
 like
 the
 apples.


>> Yes.
 Right.
 And
 yeah,
 it's
 just
 the


inverse
 of
 that.
 Um
 and
 so,
 uh
 I'm
 not


saying
 that
 that's
 enough
 to
 change
 like


an
 addicted
 behavior
 or
 anything
 like


that,
 but
 so
 many
 of
 your
 behaviors
 will


curtail
 themselves
 possibly
 to
 the


desired
 degree
 if
 it
 is
 less
 obvious.
 if


it's
 not
 as
 accessible.
 Another
 little


rule
 that
 I
 follow
 is
 I
 take
 my
 phone


and
 I
 try
 to
 leave
 it
 uh
 in
 another
 room


until
 lunch
 each
 day.
 So
 that
 just
 gives


me
 from
 like
 9
 to
 noonish
 where
 I
 can


work
 on
 my
 own
 agenda
 and
 not
 respond
 to


everybody
 else's
 agenda.
 You
 know,
 I'm


not
 interrupted.
 And
 if
 if
 I
 have
 my


phone
 next
 to
 me,
 I'm
 like
 everybody


else.
 I'll
 check
 it
 every
 3
 minutes
 just


cuz
 it's
 there,
 right?
 But
 I
 have
 a
 home


office
 and
 so
 I
 put
 it
 in
 a
 different


room.
 It's
 just
 down
 the
 hall.
 It's
 only


like
 30
 seconds
 away,
 but
 I
 never
 go
 get


it.
 And
 so
 many
 behaviors
 are
 like
 that.


It's
 like,
 well,
 did
 you
 want
 it
 or
 not?


You
 know,
 like
 in
 the
 one
 sense,
 you


wanted
 it
 so
 bad
 that
 you
 would
 check
 it


every
 3
 minutes
 when
 it
 was
 next
 to
 you,


but
 in
 another
 sense,
 you
 never
 wanted


it
 bad
 enough
 that
 you
 would
 work
 for
 30


seconds
 and
 walk
 down
 the
 hall
 to
 get


it.
 And
 so,
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 friction
 can


sometimes
 go
 a
 long
 way
 in
 shaping
 a


behavior.


>> What
 would
 you
 say
 to
 somebody
 who


doesn't
 have
 the
 confidence
 to
 start?


Anytime
 you
 do
 something
 new,
 by


definition,
 you
 are
 doing
 something


you're
 unqualified
 for.
 It
 can't
 it


can't
 be
 if
 you've
 already
 done
 it.
 If


you
 already
 have
 some
 type
 of


qualification
 or
 skill
 set
 or


experience,
 then
 you're
 qualified
 for


it.
 It
 can't
 be
 new.
 It's
 just
 something


you're
 repeating
 that
 you've
 done


before.
 So,
 you
 have
 to
 realize
 that


there
 is
 some
 level
 of
 uncertainty
 that


comes
 with
 anything
 that
 is
 new.
 So,
 I


think
 just
 accepting
 that
 is
 a
 good


starting
 place.
 The
 the
 second
 thing
 is


that
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 figure
 it
 all
 out


today.
 Like
 one
 of
 the
 frameworks
 that
 I


like,
 I
 think
 I
 heard
 this
 originally


from
 Sean
 Puri.
 He
 said
 ABC.
 Okay,
 so
 A


is
 an
 honest
 assessment
 of
 your
 current


situation.
 Look,
 try
 to
 look
 at
 your


current
 reality
 with
 clear
 eyes.
 Z
 is


where
 you
 ultimately
 want
 to
 end
 up.
 And


B
 is
 your
 next
 step.
 And
 all
 you
 need
 to


know
 is
 A,
 B,
 and
 Z.
 You
 don't
 need
 to


know
 steps
 C
 through
 Y.
 But
 so
 often


people
 will
 convince
 themselves,
 well,
 I


don't
 know
 what
 steps
 C
 through
 Y
 are.


or
 even
 if
 they
 realize
 they're
 not


going
 to
 plan
 it
 all
 out,
 they're
 like,


"Yeah,
 but
 I
 kind
 of
 want
 to
 know
 what


C,
 D,
 and
 E
 are."
 You
 know,
 they
 want
 to


be
 able
 to
 see
 a
 little
 bit
 further
 into


the
 future.
 But
 you
 have
 to
 become


comfortable
 with
 some
 level
 of


uncertainty.
 There's
 that
 quote,
 I
 just


shared
 it
 in
 my
 newsletter
 recently.
 I


think
 it's
 from
 Ian
 Wilson.
 He
 was
 a
 GE


executive
 where
 he
 said,
 "No
 amount
 of


information
 is
 going
 to
 allay
 the
 fact


that
 all
 of
 your
 knowledge
 is
 about
 the


past
 and
 all
 of
 your
 decisions
 are
 about


the
 future."
 It's
 just
 a
 fundamental


reality
 of
 life.
 Knowledge
 is
 purely


about
 the
 past
 and
 what
 has
 been
 learned


and
 decisions
 are
 purely
 about
 the


future
 and
 what
 cannot
 be
 predicted.
 And


so
 you
 have
 to
 become
 okay
 with
 with


that
 reality.
 In
 a
 lot
 of
 ways,
 I


actually
 think
 the
 most
 powerful
 form
 of


mental
 toughness,
 the
 most
 powerful
 or


resilient
 form
 of
 preparation
 is
 a


mindset
 that
 can
 handle
 uncertainty.
 You


know,
 it's
 the
 we
 all
 we
 all
 try
 to


resist
 this,
 you
 know,
 we
 try
 to
 control


reality.
 We
 try
 to
 predict
 scenarios
 and


outcomes.
 We
 try
 to
 figure
 out
 what's


going
 to
 happen
 ahead
 of
 time.
 But


really
 all
 you
 need
 is
 not
 to
 predict


the
 future.
 What
 you
 need
 is
 the


confidence
 that
 you
 can
 handle


uncertainty.
 That
 that
 whatever
 happens,


I
 will
 be
 able
 to
 figure
 it
 out.
 I
 think


if
 I
 was
 going
 to
 encapsulate


entrepreneurship
 in
 a
 nutshell,
 I
 would


say
 it
 is
 the
 trust
 and
 the
 willingness


that
 you
 can
 figure
 it
 out.
 Um,
 it's
 the


it's
 there's
 always
 going
 to
 be
 some


point
 on
 the
 curve
 with
 your
 business


where
 you're
 like,
 well,
 we're
 not
 quite


sure
 what
 the
 future's
 going
 to
 bring.


You
 know,
 I
 have
 a
 podcast
 and
 who
 knows


how
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 change
 that,
 but
 if


you're
 if
 you
 trust
 that
 you
 can
 figure


it
 out,
 great.
 You
 can
 be
 an


entrepreneur.
 You'll
 make,
 you
 know,


you'll
 figure
 it
 out
 along
 the
 way.


>> How
 do
 we
 develop
 that
 mindset


practically?
 Like


>> I
 think
 that
 it's
 practiced
 in
 small


ways
 and
 then
 it
 accumulates
 over
 time.


So,
 um,
 I
 don't
 think
 sports
 is
 the
 only


way
 to
 do
 this,
 but
 it's
 the
 way
 that
 I


did
 it.
 So,
 I'll
 use
 it
 as
 an
 example.


There
 are
 many
 ways
 you
 could
 do
 it.
 Um,


one
 thing
 that's
 great
 about
 sports
 is


that
 you
 have
 to
 fail
 publicly.
 Um,
 you


know,
 so
 you
 I
 played
 I
 played
 baseball


all
 the
 way
 through
 college,
 played
 it


for
 17
 years
 of
 my
 life
 and
 um,
 you


know,
 the
 early
 years
 you're
 in
 T-ball


or
 little
 league
 or
 whatever
 and
 you're


playing
 and
 then
 you
 make
 an
 error.
 That


does
 not
 feel
 good,
 right?
 Like
 you
 let


the
 whole
 team
 down,
 but
 you
 realize


that
 life
 goes
 on.
 You
 failed
 publicly


and
 you
 move
 forward.
 Um
 later
 when
 I


was
 in
 college,
 you
 know,
 we're
 not
 only


playing
 games
 together,
 we're
 also


training
 together
 in
 the
 gym.
 You
 show


up
 in
 the
 gym,
 you
 look
 at
 the
 guy
 next


to
 you,
 you
 realize
 he's
 a
 little
 bit


stronger
 than
 you.
 That
 doesn't
 feel


great.
 You
 see
 that?
 Then
 you're
 like,


"Well,
 let
 me
 try
 to
 set
 a
 new
 PR.
 I'll


throw
 five
 more
 pounds
 on
 the
 bar."
 You


fail
 in
 front
 of
 everybody.
 You
 miss


that
 lift.


>> That
 doesn't
 feel
 good.
 But


>> you
 move
 on.
 30
 seconds
 later,
 you
 get


back
 to
 it
 and
 you
 go
 do
 the
 next
 thing.


And
 it
 happens
 again
 and
 again
 in
 small


ways.
 But
 failing
 publicly
 trains
 your


mind.
 It
 teaches
 you
 that
 what
 matters


most
 is
 not
 that
 you
 always
 win,
 but


that
 you
 always
 keep
 reaching,
 that
 you


always
 keep
 striving.
 In
 a
 lot
 of
 ways,


the
 real
 important
 question
 to
 ask
 is


not
 what
 can
 I
 succeed
 on
 or
 what
 can
 I


achieve,
 but
 what
 is
 worth
 reaching
 for,


you
 know,
 and
 that's
 really
 what
 you


want
 is
 to
 keep
 reaching,
 to
 keep


striving.
 And
 as
 you
 train
 that
 muscle


and
 develop
 it
 in
 all
 those
 little
 small


ways,
 eventually
 you
 get
 to
 a
 point


where
 you
 can
 handle
 it
 in
 big
 ways.
 You


know,
 I
 remember
 my
 senior
 year,
 my
 my


final
 season,
 um
 I
 said
 like,
 I
 don't


want
 us
 to
 lose,
 but
 if
 we're
 going
 to


lose,
 I
 want
 to
 be
 the
 one
 who's


playing,
 you
 know,
 like
 put
 me
 out


there.
 I
 can
 handle
 I
 can
 take
 the
 loss,


you
 know,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 lose,
 but
 I


can
 handle
 it.
 Um
 and
 I
 feel
 that
 way


now,
 too,
 about
 stuff
 that
 I
 do,
 you


know,
 in
 business.
 I
 put
 everything
 that


I
 had
 into
 the
 Atomic
 Habits
 launch,
 you


know,
 like
 I
 we
 started
 planning
 that


launch
 15
 months
 ahead
 of
 time.
 Um,
 and


I
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 places
 in
 life,
 good


enough
 is
 good
 enough,
 but
 every
 now
 and


then
 you
 find
 an
 area
 where
 good
 enough


is
 not
 good
 enough
 and
 you
 want
 to
 do
 it


the
 best
 you
 can
 do
 it.
 And
 I
 decided


that
 for
 me,
 that
 was
 one
 of
 those


things
 that
 I
 was
 going
 to
 try
 to
 do
 as


good
 as
 I
 could
 possibly
 do
 it.
 And
 that


comes
 with
 risk.
 That
 comes
 with


vulnerability.
 You
 know,
 you're
 going
 to


spend
 your
 next
 year
 and
 a
 half


promoting
 and
 pushing
 and
 talking
 about


this
 thing
 that
 you
 poured
 three
 to
 five


years
 of
 your
 life
 into.
 What
 if
 people


hate
 it?
 What
 if
 the
 reviews
 aren't
 any


good?
 You
 know,
 what
 if
 you
 secure
 big


interviews
 and
 you
 go
 on
 morning
 shows


and
 then
 the
 book
 flops
 and
 it
 doesn't


sell?
 Um,
 what
 if
 the
 publisher
 is
 mad


at
 me
 because
 they
 paid
 me
 in
 advance
 or


they
 were
 expecting
 it
 to
 do
 well
 and


then
 it
 doesn't
 perform?
 And
 like
 you


sit
 with
 all
 those
 questions
 and
 my


thought
 I
 think
 partially
 because
 I
 had


trained
 that
 muscle
 uh
 over
 time
 was
 I


can
 handle
 it
 you
 know
 like
 if
 it
 if
 we


lose
 I'll
 I'll
 deal
 with
 it
 you
 know
 and


you'll
 be
 fine.
 Um
 but
 you
 have
 I
 think


once
 you
 have
 that
 confidence
 then
 you


have
 the
 confidence
 to
 go
 for
 it
 fully


you
 know
 the
 problem
 is
 if
 you
 don't


have
 that
 confidence
 you
 start
 talking


yourself
 out
 of
 it.
 You
 water
 it
 down.


You
 know
 you
 don't
 promote
 it
 all
 the


way.
 you
 don't
 do
 all
 the
 things
 you


could
 do
 because
 you're
 kind
 of
 scared


of
 what
 the
 result
 could
 be.
 What
 if
 it


doesn't
 go
 well?
 So
 then
 I
 don't
 go
 all


the
 way
 in
 and
 then
 it
 kind
 of
 becomes
 a


self-fulfilling
 prophecy
 because
 it
 for


sure
 isn't
 going
 to
 work
 that
 well
 if


you
 don't
 give
 it
 everything
 you
 have.


>> As
 you're
 saying
 that,
 the
 thing
 that


comes
 to
 mind
 is
 like
 the
 difference


between
 playing
 to
 win
 and
 playing
 not


to
 lose


>> and
 the
 hesitation
 that
 comes
 with


playing
 not
 to
 lose
 versus
 like
 just


going
 for
 it.


>> Yeah.


There's
 in
 the
 World
 Cup
 final,
 women's


World
 Cup
 a
 couple
 years
 ago,
 uh
 the
 US


beat
 Japan
 and
 Carly
 Lloyd
 scored
 like


three
 goals
 in
 that
 game.
 Um
 and
 I
 think


the
 third
 of
 her
 goal
 she
 kicked
 from


midfield.
 It
 was
 like
 just
 super
 long,


but
 she
 the
 cool
 thing
 about
 that
 play


is
 that
 she
 saw
 the
 opportunity
 to
 go


for
 it
 and
 she
 went
 for
 it
 right
 away.


She
 never
 talked
 herself
 out
 of
 it.
 It


was
 a
 shot
 that
 you
 would
 never
 take
 in


most
 circumstances.
 It's
 not
 a
 good


shot.
 It's
 not
 a
 high
 percentage
 shot.


Um,
 but
 she
 saw
 an
 opening
 and
 she
 went


for
 it.
 There
 was
 no
 hesitation.
 Um,


similarly,
 totally
 different
 domain.
 Uh,


one
 time
 my
 wife
 and
 I,
 my
 wife's,
 I'm


not
 very
 musical
 at
 all,
 but
 my
 wife
 is,


and
 we
 were
 listening
 to
 Zack
 Brown
 Band


play
 a
 song,
 and
 she
 was
 like,
 "One


thing
 I
 love
 about
 listening
 to
 him
 sing


is
 that
 there's
 no
 hesitation
 in
 his


voice.
 When
 he
 when
 it
 comes
 time
 to


sing
 the
 lyric,
 he's
 like
 fully
 in
 it.


Um,
 he's
 not
 like
 secondguessing
 himself


or
 doubting
 himself.
 There's
 like


singing
 with
 confidence."
 And
 so
 in
 all


these
 different
 domains,
 sports,
 music,


business,
 you
 can't
 have
 that


hesitation.
 You
 know,
 you
 don't
 want
 to


be
 the
 one
 talking
 yourself
 out
 of
 it.
 I


think
 uh
 for
 me,
 I
 try
 to
 not
 be
 my
 own


bottleneck.
 You
 know,
 I
 I
 don't
 want
 to


have
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 the
 first
 person


to
 tell
 myself
 no.


>> You
 know,
 I
 want
 the
 world
 to
 tell
 me
 no


first
 and
 then
 I'll
 and
 then
 I'll
 adjust


based
 on
 the
 feedback
 that
 I
 get,
 but
 I


don't
 want
 to
 talk
 myself
 out
 of
 it.
 One


of
 my
 little
 sayings
 internally
 is
 like


I
 try
 to
 work
 backwards
 from
 magic.
 So


what
 would
 the
 magical
 outcome
 be
 and


then
 let
 me
 try
 to
 figure
 out
 a
 couple


different
 paths
 that
 could
 potentially


get
 me
 there
 and
 I'll
 start
 to
 take


steps
 forward
 and
 then
 I'll
 get
 feedback


from
 the
 world.
 You
 know,
 I
 don't
 tell


myself
 no.
 Maybe
 the
 world
 will
 tell
 me


no
 and
 I
 need
 to
 adjust
 the
 course.
 But


I
 start
 with
 the
 magical
 outcome
 and


then
 go
 from
 there.
 And
 what
 you
 find,
 I


mean,
 I
 see
 it
 with
 family.
 I
 see
 it


with
 friends.
 Like
 so
 many
 people
 that


I'm
 around,


>> almost
 always
 you
 talk
 yourself
 out
 of


it
 before
 the
 world
 actually
 prevents


you
 from
 doing
 it
 there.
 It's
 very
 rare


that
 you
 truly
 run
 up
 against
 a
 hard


stop
 in
 the
 world
 where
 they
 say,


"Sorry,
 this
 isn't
 possible.
 What
 you're


trying
 to
 do
 is
 it
 can't
 happen.
 There's


almost
 always
 somebody
 else
 you
 could


have
 talked
 to,
 another
 approach
 you


could
 have
 taken,
 another
 attempt
 you


could
 have
 gone
 for,
 and
 you're
 the
 one


who
 talks
 yourself
 out
 of
 doing
 it.
 Um,


not
 the
 world."
 And
 so
 I
 try
 to
 not
 be


that
 person.
 I
 try
 to,
 you
 know,
 give


myself
 permission
 to
 go
 for
 it
 and
 then


adjust
 along
 the
 way.


>> I
 love
 these
 little
 sayings
 you
 have.


You
 move
 like
 thunder,


>> you
 know,
 work
 backwards
 from
 magic.


What
 other
 internal
 sayings
 do
 you
 have


that
 really
 resonate
 with
 you
 in
 this


moment?


>> Um,
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 things
 I
 learned


from
 my
 grandfather
 was
 he
 his
 little


saying
 was
 PMA,
 positive
 mental


attitude.
 So
 in
 any
 scenario
 you
 try
 to


have
 a
 positive
 outlook
 regardless
 of


the
 current
 circumstances.
 And
 that


sounds
 a
 little
 kind
 of
 woo
 wooey


sometimes
 or
 you
 know
 always
 think


positive
 or
 whatever
 but
 I
 have
 tried
 to


become
 better
 at
 practicing
 it
 and


teaching
 my
 kids
 how
 to
 practice
 it.
 So,


one
 way
 that
 you
 can
 do
 it
 is
 when
 you


run
 up
 against
 something
 that
 feels
 kind


of
 difficult
 or
 feels
 like
 um
 you
 don't


feel
 confident
 about
 it,
 you
 try
 to


rehearse
 it
 visually
 and
 you
 emphasize


the
 good
 portions
 of
 what
 could
 happen.


And
 this
 can
 this
 can
 happen
 either
 in


retrospect
 or
 it
 can
 happen
 uh


previsualization
 before
 the
 thing


happens.
 So,
 I'll
 give
 you
 two
 examples.


In
 retrospect,
 when
 I
 played
 baseball


and
 I
 was
 like
 10
 or
 12
 or
 14,
 after


each
 season,
 we
 would
 go
 sit
 on
 the
 back


deck
 at
 my
 parents
 house
 and
 my
 dad
 and


I
 would
 talk
 about
 the
 g
 the
 year
 and
 we


would
 talk
 about
 the
 good
 plays
 from
 the


year,
 my
 best
 plays,
 my
 best
 games,
 the


games
 that
 we
 won.
 We
 would
 we
 would
 try


to
 highlight
 I
 didn't
 know
 this
 at
 the


time,
 but
 what
 he
 was
 doing
 was
 he
 was


helping
 me
 highlight
 the
 wins
 from,
 you


know,
 small
 and
 big
 from
 that
 last


season.
 And
 uh
 I
 can
 remember
 some
 of


the
 conversations
 that
 we
 had
 like
 one
 I


I
 got
 into
 high
 school
 and
 I
 was
 never


the
 best
 player
 on
 any
 team
 that
 I
 was


on.
 But
 he
 was
 like,
 "Look,
 if
 you
 just


keep
 sticking
 with
 it,
 what
 you're
 going


to
 find
 is
 that
 guys
 will
 drop
 off
 each


year,
 you
 know,
 and
 so
 by
 just
 by


there's
 this
 power
 of
 longevity
 of


staying
 in
 the
 game
 that
 will
 benefit


you."
 And
 he
 was
 right.
 I
 I
 became
 a


better
 player
 every
 year
 that
 I
 played.


Um
 so
 that's
 like
 a
 retrospective
 one.


you
 are
 you
 emphasizing
 your
 wins
 and


then
 the
 looking
 forward
 if
 you
 do
 like


a
 previsisualization
 version
 of
 it.
 So,


I
 have
 a
 couple
 kids.
 Um,
 one
 of
 them
 is


three
 and
 starting
 preschool.
 And,
 uh,


he
 went
 to
 preschool
 on
 the
 first
 day.


He
 had
 a
 hard
 drop
 off.
 He
 he
 didn't


like
 it.
 Don't,
 you
 know,
 don't
 leave


me.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 this
 place
 is.
 It


feels,
 you
 know,
 scary,
 whatever.
 So,
 he


had
 a
 tough
 day
 getting
 dropped
 off
 the


first
 time.
 Second
 day
 comes,
 same


thing.
 Kind
 of
 cries
 a
 little
 bit.
 Has
 a


tough
 day
 when
 he
 gets
 dropped
 off.
 So,


the
 third
 day,
 um,
 I
 get
 them
 up
 in
 the


morning
 and
 I
 get
 get
 them
 ready
 and
 get


them
 breakfast
 and
 stuff.
 So,
 I'm
 in
 the


kitchen.
 I
 said,
 "All
 right,
 guys.


Today's
 a
 preschool
 day."
 And


immediately
 he
 was
 like
 and
 I
 was
 like


hold
 on
 hold
 on
 hold
 on.
 Um
 you
 like


your
 teachers,
 right?
 Miss
 Jaylen,
 Miss


Caitlyn,
 don't
 you
 like
 them?
 He's
 like,


"Yeah."
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 "Okay.
 Um
 what


did
 you
 guys
 do
 yesterday?
 You
 got
 to


play
 with
 the
 crayons
 and
 the
 glue


sticks.
 Like
 that
 was
 fun,
 wasn't
 it?"


He
 was
 like, "Yeah."
 Um
 I
 said, "You


have
 snack
 time
 and
 lunch.
 Like
 that


those
 are
 good
 things."
 He's
 like,


"Yeah."
 And
 then
 I
 said,
 "After
 school,


you
 go
 play
 on
 the
 playground.
 You
 get


to
 go
 down
 the
 slides
 and
 everything."


He's
 like, "Yeah,
 yeah."
 And
 that
 was


all
 I
 said,
 you
 know,
 but
 what
 I'm


trying
 to
 do
 is
 to
 get
 him
 to
 emphasize


the
 positive
 portions
 of
 what's
 about
 to


come,
 to
 imagine
 what
 it
 would
 be
 like


for
 the
 day
 to
 be
 good.
 And
 um
 he
 went
 I


don't know,
 maybe
 we
 just
 got
 lucky,
 but


he
 went
 and
 he
 had
 a
 great
 drop
 off
 that


day,
 you
 know,
 and
 he's
 he's
 loved
 it


every
 day
 since.
 He's
 he's
 been
 fine.


And
 so
 you
 can
 see
 how
 that
 skill
 can
 be


applied
 throughout
 life.
 You
 know,


they're
 in
 fourth
 grade
 and
 they're


getting
 ready
 to
 give
 their
 first


presentation
 and
 they
 feel
 nervous
 about


talking
 in
 front
 of
 the
 class.
 Great.


let's
 walk
 through
 this
 and
 emphasize


what
 the
 good
 parts
 are
 going
 to
 be.
 Um


or
 you
 know
 they're
 getting
 they're
 in


eighth
 grade
 and
 they're
 going to
 go
 to


their
 first
 school
 dance
 and
 they
 feel


weird
 and
 awkward
 about
 it.
 Like
 let's


talk
 about
 what
 a
 good
 night
 would
 look


like.
 And
 so
 so
 many
 of
 your
 problems
 in


life
 come
 from
 your
 brain


overemphasizing


minor
 details,
 the
 wrong
 minor
 details.


And
 what
 I'm
 trying
 to
 do
 with
 both


myself
 and
 my
 kids
 and
 the
 people
 around


me
 is
 to
 encourage
 them
 to
 emphasize


good
 minor
 details.
 um
 you
 know
 to
 what


what
 portion
 of
 the
 day
 are
 you
 latching


on
 to
 and
 what
 story
 are
 you
 telling


yourself
 and
 so
 the
 more
 that
 you
 can
 do


that
 I
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 muscle
 the


more
 that
 you
 do
 it
 the
 better
 you
 get


at
 it
 and
 that's
 ultimately
 that
 goes


back
 to
 that
 PMA
 positive
 mental


attitude
 that
 you
 know
 my
 grandpa
 taught


me
 um
 and
 so
 that's
 another
 one
 of
 my


little


>> I
 love
 that
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about


reputation
 I
 want
 to
 hear
 maybe
 I'll


just
 say
 the
 word
 and
 like
 you
 can
 riff


on
 it
 for
 a
 few
 minutes


>> reputation
 like
 my
 reputation
 or
 how
 I


think
 about
 it
 how
 I
 think
 about


reputation


I
 don't
 really
 think
 about
 it
 that
 much.


Um
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 that
 worried
 about


it.
 Um


I
 guess
 the
 main
 way
 that
 I
 think
 about


it
 is
 I
 want
 to
 be
 known
 as
 someone
 who


is
 useful.
 You
 know,
 like
 useful
 is
 a


word
 that
 I
 come
 back
 to
 a
 lot.
 If
 you


if
 you
 uh
 Josh
 Kaufman
 has
 a
 good


framework.
 It's
 like
 three
 things.
 I


think
 it's
 true,
 useful,
 and
 clear.
 Um


you
 know,
 it's
 like
 you
 want
 to
 write


things
 that
 are
 true
 and
 accurate.
 You


want
 to
 write
 things
 that
 are
 useful
 and


actionable.
 And
 you
 want
 to
 be
 clear
 and


understandable
 in
 how
 you
 do
 it.
 I
 think


that
 that
 does
 describe
 a
 lot
 of
 my


approach
 and
 how
 I'm
 trying
 to
 focus
 on,


you
 know,
 putting
 work
 into
 the
 world.


Um,


all right.
 So,
 I
 guess
 I
 don't
 think


about
 my
 reputation
 that
 much,
 but
 this


is
 how
 I
 generally
 think
 about


reputation,
 status,
 brand,
 whatever.


Ultimately,
 your
 reputation
 will
 be
 the


work,
 the
 quality
 of
 the
 work
 that
 you


do.
 So,
 it
 is,
 I
 think
 Brent
 Behore
 said


at
 one
 point,
 it's
 like
 the
 range
 of


outcomes
 that
 you
 can
 expect
 from
 a


brand.
 Um,
 and
 so
 the
 more
 that
 you
 do


things
 that
 are
 high
 quality
 and
 useful


and
 valuable
 and
 actionable,
 the
 more


that
 you
 will
 become
 known
 for
 that.


Now,
 there
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 priming


that
 can
 go
 on.
 So,
 like
 at
 the
 top
 of


321,
 my
 newsletter,
 it
 says
 uh
 the
 most


wisdom
 per
 word
 of
 any
 newsletter
 on
 the


web.
 I'm
 trying
 to
 set
 an
 expectation


there,
 right?
 Like
 it's
 when
 somebody


signs
 up
 and
 subscribes
 and
 they
 read


that.
 Now
 you
 see
 that
 and
 you're
 like,


"Okay,
 I'm
 about
 to
 read
 something
 that


has
 a
 lot
 of
 wisdom
 and
 is
 like
 dense


and
 informative.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 signal


and
 very
 little
 noise."
 That's
 the
 the


tone
 I'm
 trying
 to
 set.
 Now,
 the
 flip


side
 of
 that
 is
 you
 have
 to
 deliver.


>> And
 so
 if
 you
 if
 you
 set
 that


expectation
 and
 you
 don't
 actually


deliver,
 well,
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 go
 very


well.
 And
 so
 I'm
 also
 putting
 the


responsibility
 on
 me
 a
 little
 bit.
 You


know,
 there's
 like
 nothing
 to
 hide


behind.
 I
 do
 this
 with
 my
 Instagram


account.
 It's
 like
 a
 very
 weird


Instagram
 account.
 you
 know,
 there's
 no


photos
 of
 me.
 It's
 just
 text.
 Um,
 but


it's
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 peacock's
 tail,
 you


know,
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 it's
 a
 very


useful
 hindrance.
 Like,
 it's
 very
 visual


visual
 and
 it
 shows
 which
 peacocks
 are


uh
 strong
 enough
 to
 have
 this
 kind
 of


superfluous
 tail
 to
 still
 survive
 and


escape
 predators.
 Those
 are
 the
 ones


that
 have
 great
 genes.
 Well,
 when
 you


can't
 hide
 behind
 anything
 else
 on
 your


Instagram
 account
 and
 it's
 just
 words,


the
 ideas
 have
 to
 be
 good
 enough.
 you


know,
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 useful
 uh
 hindrance.


It's
 a
 useful
 um
 blockage
 to
 getting


people's
 attention.
 And
 so
 I'm
 like,


well,
 if
 it's
 just
 going
 to
 be
 words,


they
 better
 be
 pretty
 good.
 So,
 um
 I


think
 about
 setting
 those
 priming
 those


expectations
 and
 setting
 those
 standards


and
 then
 also
 trying
 to
 reach
 them.
 But


ultimately,
 it's
 just
 about
 the
 quality


of
 the
 work
 that
 you
 do.
 And
 so,
 the


more
 that
 you
 show
 up
 with
 value
 and


useful
 ideas,
 uh
 the
 more
 you
 become


known
 for
 that.
 Um,
 I
 think
 I
 also,
 this


is
 kind
 of
 connected
 to
 reputation,
 but


I
 I
 don't
 think
 about
 shaping
 it
 for
 me


that
 much,
 but


the
 lens
 should
 be
 mostly
 focused
 on
 the


reader,
 not
 on
 yourself.
 I
 think
 if
 you


if
 you
 think
 a
 lot
 about
 reputation
 and


you're
 trying
 to
 like
 cultivate
 this


image,
 that's
 the
 energy
 is
 focused
 in


the
 wrong
 direction.
 Um,
 if
 you're


focused
 on
 the
 reader,
 then
 you
 start


asking
 different
 questions.
 How
 can
 I


create
 something
 that's
 incredibly


useful
 for
 somebody?
 How
 can
 I
 make
 it


more
 actionable?
 How
 can
 I
 make
 it


easier
 to
 understand
 and
 simpler?
 How


can
 I
 make
 it
 easy
 enough
 that
 I
 can


teach
 it?
 Um,
 now
 all
 those
 questions


are
 focused
 on
 the
 reader,
 you
 know,


view
 or
 their
 from
 their
 position.
 And


then
 there's
 also
 just
 questions
 like


what
 do
 people
 need
 right
 now?
 You
 know,


like
 what
 what
 is
 what
 does
 somebody


what
 would
 Yeah,
 what
 are
 people
 asking


for?
 Um,
 and
 trying
 to
 pay
 attention
 to


that.
 So,
 for
 the
 most
 part,
 I
 think


reputation
 takes
 care
 of
 itself
 if
 you


try
 to
 take
 care
 of
 other
 people.
 Um,


and
 if
 your
 if
 your
 lens
 is
 focused
 on


them,
 then
 it
 ends
 up,
 you
 know,
 working


just
 fine
 for
 you.


>> I
 love
 that.
 Thanks.
 What
 about


positioning?


>> Positioning
 is
 critical.
 Um,
 positioning


is
 something
 that
 I


think
 a
 lot
 about.
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 have


it
 figured
 out
 yet,
 but
 I
 have
 seen
 how


powerful
 it
 can
 be.
 Um,
 so
 let
 me
 give


you
 a
 couple
 examples.
 I'll
 start
 with


positioning
 for
 books
 and
 then
 I'll


start
 talking
 about
 positioning
 for


life.
 So


any
 product,
 the
 way
 that
 it
 is


positioned
 and
 packaged
 is
 probably
 50%


of
 its
 success.
 Um,
 a
 couple
 examples


from
 books.
 Atomic
 Habits
 has
 a
 chapter


later
 in
 it
 where
 I
 talk
 about


deliberate
 practice.
 It
 could
 have
 been


a
 book
 about
 deliberate
 practice
 where
 I


talk
 about
 habits,
 but
 instead
 it's
 a


book
 about
 habits
 where
 I
 talk
 about


deliberate
 practice.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 way


those
 two
 books
 would
 sell,
 the


difference
 is
 enormous.
 Um,
 if
 you
 don't


know
 what
 deliberate
 practice
 is,
 it


takes
 30
 seconds
 to
 unpack
 it
 and


describe
 it.
 How
 is
 it
 different
 than


regular
 practice
 and
 so
 on.
 You
 don't


get
 30
 seconds
 when
 somebody's
 thinking


about
 buying
 a
 book.
 You're
 not
 there
 at


the
 store
 to
 explain
 it
 to
 them.
 So,
 the


packaging,
 the
 positioning
 of
 the
 book,


which
 I
 would
 describe
 as
 pretty
 much


anything
 that
 you
 see
 on
 the
 cover,
 has


to
 sell
 itself
 in
 7
 seconds,
 you
 know.


Um,
 and
 just
 by
 virtue
 of
 growing
 up
 in


society
 and
 being
 part
 of
 the
 world,
 you


know
 that
 having
 good
 habits
 is


favorable
 and
 having
 bad
 habits
 is


unfavorable.
 And
 I
 don't
 need
 to
 sell


anybody
 on
 that.
 All
 I
 need
 to
 sell
 you


on
 is,
 hey,
 if
 you
 only
 read
 one
 book


about
 habits,
 Atomic
 Habits
 should
 be


the
 one.
 And
 that's
 a
 much
 different


pitch.
 Um,
 and
 so
 the
 positioning
 and


packaging
 makes
 a
 big
 difference.


Another
 example,
 one
 that,
 um,
 so


Author's
 Equity
 is
 this
 book
 publisher


that
 I
 helped
 co-found.
 We
 have
 a
 book


coming
 out
 uh
 called
 the
 overthinkers's


guide
 to
 making
 decisions
 and
 that
 is


basically
 a
 book
 about
 choices.
 It's
 a


book
 about
 choosing
 and
 making


decisions.
 It
 could
 have
 been
 called


something
 else
 you
 know
 it
 could
 have


been
 called
 the
 decision
 guide
 or
 the


power
 of
 choice
 or
 something
 you
 know
 it


could
 have
 been
 called
 that.
 But
 the


overthinker's
 guide
 to
 making
 decisions


is
 a
 great
 package.
 It's
 a
 great
 frame.


I
 have
 told
 multiple
 people
 about
 it
 and


they
 the
 reply
 to
 me
 has
 been
 oh
 I
 need


that.
 Um
 and
 that's
 usually
 a
 sign
 that


you
 got
 the
 packaging
 right
 is
 that
 you


know
 people
 are
 interested
 in
 that
 way.


So
 um
 those
 are
 two
 examples
 of


positioning
 for
 products
 and
 I
 think
 any


any
 product


the
 positioning
 and
 packaging
 is
 a


critical
 part
 of
 the
 success.
 Um


before
 I
 go
 on
 to
 positioning
 about
 life


I
 just
 want
 to
 mention
 a
 few
 things
 that


make
 uh
 for
 good
 positioning.
 So


a
 lot
 of
 this
 is
 are
 principles
 from


direct
 response
 copywriting.
 It's
 a
 good


domain
 to
 study
 or
 good
 a
 good
 place
 to


look
 for
 examples.
 But
 one
 of
 the
 core


principles
 of
 direct
 response


copywriting
 is
 that
 you
 should
 try
 to


solve
 or
 address
 a
 timeless
 and
 enduring


desire
 that
 people
 have.


>> And
 so
 many
 books
 and
 other
 products,


but
 I
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 about
 books.
 So
 many


books
 um
 are
 kind
 of
 adjacent
 to
 a


desire
 people
 have.
 They're
 not
 the


actual
 desire.
 And
 then
 you're
 kind
 of


in
 this
 uphill
 battle
 where
 you're


trying
 to
 convince
 somebody
 to
 pay


attention
 to
 something
 that
 they
 don't


actually
 care
 about.
 But
 you
 want
 to


address
 a
 timeless
 and
 enduring
 desire.


So,
 um,
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 makes
 for
 a
 really


good
 book
 title
 is
 part
 of
 what
 makes


for
 good
 packaging.
 So,
 good
 book
 titles


usually
 have
 three
 or
 four
 qualities.


The
 first
 quality
 is
 it
 addresses
 a


timeless
 or
 enduring
 desire.
 The
 second


quality
 is
 it
 tells
 you
 what
 the
 book
 is


actually
 about,
 which
 sounds
 kind
 of


obvious,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 time
 people


kind
 of
 like
 keyword
 stuff
 titles,
 you


know,
 they
 say
 like
 how
 to
 make


millions,
 be
 happy,
 and
 live
 the
 dream.


And
 you're
 like,
 that's
 not
 even
 what


this
 book
 is
 about,
 but
 whatever.
 Um,


the
 second
 thing
 that
 or
 the
 third
 thing


that
 they
 do
 is
 that
 they
 are


an
 unmistakable
 or
 an
 ownable
 phrase.


So,
 what
 that
 usually
 means
 is
 that
 it's


a
 little
 bit
 weird
 when
 you
 first
 hear


it.
 M


>> a
 lot
 of
 the
 really
 iconic
 book
 titles


they
 are
 phrases
 that
 you
 do
 not
 hear


elsewhere
 in
 life.
 So
 um
 man's
 search


for
 meaning
 basically
 you
 only
 hear
 that


in
 the
 book
 title.
 Nobody
 uses
 that


phrase
 in
 daily
 life.


>> How
 to
 win
 friends
 and
 influence
 people


even
 to
 even
 now
 describing
 it
 as


winning
 friends
 sounds
 kind
 of
 odd
 you


know
 but
 it's
 it's
 odd
 enough
 that


there's
 no
 mistaking
 what
 you're
 talking


about.
 They
 can
 own
 the
 real
 estate
 in


the
 reader's
 mind.


>> Atomic
 habits.
 Before
 the
 book
 came
 out,


you
 would
 not
 describe
 a
 habit
 as


atomic.
 You
 might
 have
 said
 it
 was


little
 or
 small
 or
 tiny
 or
 something


like
 that,
 but
 you
 wouldn't
 say
 atomic.


It
 It's
 a
 weird
 way
 to
 describe
 a
 small


habit,
 but
 that's
 good
 because
 you
 can


own
 that
 phrase.
 So,
 um,
 unmistakable


uh,
 addresses
 a
 timeless
 or
 enduring


desire,
 tells
 you
 what
 the
 book
 is


actually
 about.
 And
 the
 final
 piece
 is


that
 usually
 there's
 an
 element
 of


contrast,
 some
 element
 of
 surprise.
 So,


Rich
 Dad,
 Poor
 Dad,
 or
 um
 the


life-changing
 magic
 of
 tidying
 up.
 I


thought
 tidying
 up
 was
 a
 small
 thing.


Now
 you're
 telling
 me
 it's


life-changing.
 Um


>> atomic
 habits,
 tiny
 changes,
 remarkable


results.
 You
 know,
 you
 want
 some
 kind
 of


contrast
 between
 sometimes
 it's
 small
 to


big,
 sometimes
 it's
 the
 easy
 thing,
 the


easy
 thing
 you
 can
 do
 to
 accomplish
 the


hard
 thing.
 But
 there
 needs
 to
 be
 some


form
 of
 contrast.
 A
 good
 example
 that's


not
 like
 a
 self-help
 book
 or
 a
 business


book
 is
 um
 astrophysics
 for
 people
 in
 a


hurry
 by
 Neil
 deGrasse
 Tyson.
 I
 thought


astrophysics
 was
 something
 that
 was


going
 to
 take
 seven
 years
 in
 a
 PhD.
 No,


actually
 just
 read
 this
 book
 in
 an
 hour


and
 a
 half.


>> And
 so
 the
 contrast
 is
 um
 is
 something


that's
 compelling.


>> So
 if
 you
 have
 those
 four
 elements
 that


usually
 leads
 to
 good
 positioning
 and


packaging.


>> All
 right.
 So
 that's
 just
 on
 the
 product


side.
 Separately
 there's
 a
 whole
 other


discussion
 about
 positioning
 which
 is


like
 life
 positioning.


>> Yeah.
 How
 can
 you
 put
 yourself
 in
 good


positions
 for
 things
 to
 happen?
 And


there
 are
 so
 many
 ways
 that
 you
 could
 do


this.
 I'm
 sure
 that
 you
 can
 think
 of


many,
 too.
 Um,
 sometimes
 it's
 just
 about


putting
 yourself
 in
 positions
 for
 good


things
 to
 happen.
 So,
 we
 talked
 earlier


about
 sharing
 your
 work
 publicly.
 Every


episode
 that
 you
 publish,
 every
 blog


post
 that
 you
 put
 out,
 every
 social


media
 post
 that
 you
 put
 up
 is
 a
 little


bit
 of
 surface
 area
 that
 somebody
 could


discover
 and
 you
 could,
 you
 know,
 have


some
 interesting
 interaction.


um
 for
 Atomic
 Habits
 on
 launch
 day.
 I


had
 an
 interview
 on
 CBS
 this
 morning
 and


um


>> I
 remember
 that.
 Yeah,
 it
 was
 it
 was
 a


big
 um
 it
 was
 a
 big
 moment
 for
 me


because
 it
 changed
 the
 launch
 of
 the


book
 from
 hey
 some
 guy
 is
 releasing
 a


book
 to
 this
 is
 a
 thing
 you
 know
 here's


a
 piece
 of
 national
 media
 it's
 people


are
 paying
 attention
 basically
 it
 made


it
 feel
 credible
 and
 real
 and
 the
 way


that
 it
 happened
 is
 I
 wrote
 an
 article


blog
 post
 on
 my
 site
 four
 years
 earlier


uh
 called
 the
 physics
 of
 productivity


and
 it
 was
 just
 me
 trying
 to
 be
 clever


taking
 Newton's
 three
 laws
 and
 applying


them
 to
 productivity


And
 it
 sat
 there
 for
 four
 years
 and
 it


it
 was
 fine.
 It
 was
 an
 average
 article.


It
 didn't
 go
 viral
 or
 anything,
 but
 it


did
 fine.
 And
 then
 a
 year
 before
 Atomic


Habits
 came
 out,
 a
 reporter
 at
 the
 New


York
 Times
 stumbled
 across
 my
 website


and
 liked
 it
 and
 they
 linked
 to
 it
 in
 an


article.
 Well,
 some
 producer
 at
 CBS
 read


that
 article
 and
 was
 like,
 "Hey,
 can
 we


have
 you
 come
 on
 and
 talk
 about
 those


productivity
 principles?"
 So,
 I
 went
 on


and
 I
 did
 a
 segment
 for
 CBS
 about
 a
 year


before
 the
 book
 came
 out.
 It
 was
 it
 was


maybe
 like
 10
 months
 or
 something.
 And


um
 I
 did
 that
 segment
 for
 like
 three


minutes,
 just
 a
 little
 interview.
 And
 as


soon
 as
 it
 got
 done,
 I
 went
 to
 Gail
 King


and
 I
 said,
 "I
 have
 a
 book
 coming
 out
 in


10
 months,
 and
 I
 want
 to
 come
 back
 on


the
 show
 and
 talk
 about
 it
 when
 it's


ready."
 And
 she
 said,
 "Sure,
 we'll
 have


you
 back
 on.
 You
 just
 need
 to
 be
 make


sure
 that
 we're
 your
 first
 interview.


Like,
 we
 want
 to
 have
 the
 first,
 you


know,
 release."
 I
 said,
 "Deal.
 What's


your
 email
 address?"
 Um
 and
 so
 I
 got
 her


email
 and
 I
 sent
 it
 to
 um
 my
 publisher


and
 we
 got
 it
 all
 linked
 up.
 So


when
 I
 wrote
 that
 article
 four
 years


earlier,
 I
 had
 no
 idea
 that
 that
 was


going
 to
 work
 out
 like
 that,
 you
 know,


but
 it
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 surface
 area.


I
 was
 putting
 myself
 in
 a
 position
 for


good
 things
 to
 happen
 by
 trying
 to


create
 something
 of
 value
 in
 an
 enduring


format.
 You
 know,
 again,
 we
 talked
 about


what
 has
 a
 long
 halfife.
 That
 blog
 post


had
 a
 halfife
 of
 at least
 four
 years.


>> Um
 and
 um
 I
 put
 myself
 in
 a
 good


position
 for
 things
 to
 break
 my
 way.
 you


don't
 know
 how
 it's
 going
 to
 happen,
 but


you
 know
 if
 you
 try
 your
 best
 each
 time


and
 you
 keep
 creating
 some
 surface
 area,


you're
 going
 to
 catch
 a
 break
 at
 some


point.
 So
 that's
 like
 a
 business


example.
 Um
 there
 are
 tons
 of
 examples


with
 margin
 of
 safety,
 especially
 with


finances.
 You
 know,
 if
 you
 give
 yourself


a
 large
 margin
 of
 safety,
 in
 other


words,
 your
 expenses
 for
 your
 life
 are


much
 less
 than
 what
 you're
 taking
 in,


you
 can
 handle
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 coming


your
 way.
 And
 so
 that
 is
 positioning


yourself
 well
 for
 the
 unexpected


elements
 of
 life.
 Um
 you
 know
 we
 have
 a


family
 um
 situation
 with
 some
 medical


stuff
 and
 there
 were
 you
 know
 there
 was


some
 customized
 medical
 equipment
 that


somebody
 needed
 because
 of
 what
 they


were
 dealing
 with
 and
 it's
 $200,000
 and


it's
 like
 it's
 a
 huge
 expense.
 Um
 but
 if


you
 give
 yourself
 a
 huge
 margin
 of


safety
 and
 you've
 been
 saving
 for
 years,


you
 don't
 know
 what
 that's
 going
 to
 be,


right?
 It
 could
 be
 that.
 It
 could
 be
 I


so
 one
 of
 my
 little
 things
 that
 I'll
 say


sometimes
 is
 like
 life
 is
 going
 to
 come


for
 you.


>> You
 just
 don't
 know
 when
 you
 don't
 know


when
 it
 will
 be
 your
 turn,
 but
 it
 will


come
 for
 you.
 There
 will
 be
 something.


Um
 so
 that
 that
 expense
 was
 not
 our


turn.
 But
 a
 couple
 years
 later,
 my
 wife


fell
 and
 broke
 her
 knee
 into
 four
 pieces


and
 I
 had
 to
 take
 six
 months
 off
 of


work.
 I'm
 like
 super
 thankful
 to


previous
 James,
 right?
 like
 James
 from


10
 years
 earlier
 that
 built
 this


business
 where
 I
 could
 actually
 take
 six


months
 off
 of
 work
 to
 take
 care
 of
 her


and
 the
 kids
 because
 what
 was
 I
 going
 to


do
 if
 I
 didn't
 have
 that
 margin
 of


safety?
 But
 I
 put
 myself
 in
 a
 position


where
 I
 was
 able
 to
 make
 that
 happen.


And
 so
 each
 year
 I
 look
 at
 my
 position


both
 in
 terms
 of
 like
 flexibility
 and
 in


terms
 of
 finances
 and
 I
 just
 I
 don't


really
 even
 care
 about
 our
 net
 worth


that
 much.
 What
 I
 care
 about
 is
 am
 I
 in


a
 stronger
 position
 this
 year?
 you
 know,


like
 as
 long
 as
 each
 year
 it's
 getting
 a


little
 bit
 stronger,
 the
 margin
 of


safety
 gets
 a
 little
 bit
 larger,
 um
 the


ability
 to
 handle
 stress
 or
 uncertainty


gets
 a
 little
 bit
 better,
 then
 you
 know,


you're
 positioning
 yourself
 better
 each


year.
 And
 so
 there
 are
 lots
 of
 ways
 to


apply
 that
 positioning
 concept.


>> Just
 a
 slight
 off
 track
 here.
 Um
 how
 are


you
 investing
 that
 money
 these
 days?


>> Um
 yeah,
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 uh
 I
 don't


know
 that
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 my


personal
 investments,
 but
 I
 will
 talk


about
 my
 personal
 philosophy.
 I
 guess


I'll
 say
 that.
 Yeah,


>> I
 um


eventually
 I
 realized
 uh
 that
 you
 can


beat
 the
 market
 but
 you
 will
 lose
 your


life.
 Um
 and
 so
 what
 I
 mean
 is
 that
 it


is
 possible
 to
 get
 outsized
 returns
 but


you
 have
 to
 spend
 all
 your
 time
 doing


it.
 And
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 a
 VC
 or
 an


investment
 advisor
 or
 you
 know
 like


somebody
 who's
 I
 don't know
 trying
 to
 be


the
 next
 Buffett
 or
 Munger
 or
 whatever.


It's
 not
 how
 I
 want
 to
 spend
 my
 time.


You
 know
 you
 only
 get
 one
 precious
 life


and
 I
 want
 to
 spend
 it
 on
 other
 things.


I
 want
 mostly
 I
 want
 to
 spend
 it


creating,
 you
 know,
 trying
 to
 make


things
 that
 didn't
 exist
 before
 um
 and


spending
 time
 with
 family.
 And
 so
 I'm


kind
 of
 optimizing
 for
 that.
 So
 if
 you


can
 be
 okay
 with
 that,
 then
 you
 realize,


well,
 maybe
 there's
 very
 different
 ways


or
 simpler
 ways
 to
 invest
 your
 money.


Like
 um
 I'm
 a
 huge
 advocate
 of
 J.


Collins
 and
 the
 simple
 path
 to
 wealth


that
 that
 book
 um
 he
 his
 approach
 I


think
 is
 great,
 which
 is
 mostly
 just


like
 dump
 it
 in
 Vanguard
 and
 let
 it


ride.
 Um,
 but
 it's
 incredibly
 simple
 and


I
 get
 all
 my
 time
 back.
 And
 if
 I'm


making
 12%
 a
 year
 rather
 than
 15%
 a


year,
 who
 cares?
 Um,
 you
 know,
 like
 I'd


rather
 trade
 the
 3%
 a
 year
 and
 get
 to


spend
 my
 hours
 the
 way
 that
 I
 want.
 So,


um,
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 approach
 is


based
 around
 that,
 around
 simplifying


and
 trying
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 I
 protect


my
 time
 more
 than
 trying
 to
 squeeze
 out


um,
 additional
 percentage
 points
 beyond


what
 the
 market
 makes.
 You
 know
 there
 I


heard
 this
 other
 phrase
 once
 which
 is


remember
 that
 the
 goal
 is
 not
 to
 beat


the
 market.
 The
 goal
 is
 to
 end
 up


wealthy.
 Um
 you
 know
 like
 so
 many
 people


are
 focused
 on
 beating
 the
 market
 that


they
 lose
 all
 their
 time
 um
 and
 uh
 end


up
 I
 don't
 know
 in
 many
 cases
 not
 even


beating
 the
 market.
 Yeah.
 So
 um
 it
 just


gives
 you
 gives
 you
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


different
 approach.
 And
 I
 think
 also


I


investing
 in
 Vanguard
 is
 incredibly


diversified
 because
 you
 got
 a
 slice
 of


every
 company.
 I
 have
 realized
 that
 I
 do


not
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 predict
 what
 is


going
 to
 go
 well.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I
 feel
 even
 more
 that
 way
 now
 than
 I


did
 a
 year
 or
 two
 ago.
 Things
 are
 moving


so
 fast.
 The
 rise
 of
 AI,
 whatever.
 Like


I
 really
 I
 cannot
 tell
 you
 what


companies
 are
 going
 to
 be
 at
 the
 top
 of


the
 Fortune
 500
 in
 three
 years
 or
 10


years.
 Like
 I
 I
 have
 no
 confidence
 in


>> they
 may
 not
 even
 exist.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 I
 have
 no
 confidence
 in
 it.
 So


um
 I
 I
 would
 rather
 not
 try
 to
 pick
 the


winners
 and
 instead
 just
 play
 the


general
 trend.
 I
 wanted
 to
 ask
 you
 about


your
 reading
 habit
 and
 how
 you
 take
 what


you're
 reading
 and
 incorporate
 it
 into


what
 you're
 doing
 or
 thinking
 about
 or


make
 it
 top
 of
 mind.
 It's
 so
 easy
 to


read
 something
 and
 sort
 of
 put
 it
 down


and
 then
 forget
 about
 it.


>> I
 wrote
 two
 articles
 a
 week
 for
 three


years
 when
 I
 started
 out
 um
 every
 Monday


and
 Thursday.
 And
 about
 a
 year
 in
 I
 hit


100,000
 subscribers
 and
 I
 had
 this


conversation
 with
 myself.
 I
 don't
 know


why
 but
 I
 got
 kind
 of
 in
 my
 head
 about


that
 number
 and
 I
 thought
 well
 now
 a
 lot


of
 people
 are
 paying
 attention
 so
 it


needs
 to
 be
 really
 good.


>> What
 I
 should
 have
 just
 said
 was
 things


are
 going
 very
 well.
 Just
 keep
 doing


what
 you're
 doing.
 Right.
 But
 um
 but
 I


thought,
 well,
 if
 I
 really
 want
 to
 make


it
 good,
 then
 I
 should
 spend
 more
 time


writing
 it,


>> right?


>> And
 what
 happened
 is
 things
 got
 worse,


not
 better.
 And
 eventually
 what
 I


realized
 is
 that
 um
 if
 I
 want
 to
 be
 a


better
 writer,
 what
 I
 needed
 was
 not
 to


write
 more,
 but
 to
 read
 more.
 And
 it's


kind
 of
 like
 uh
 filling
 a
 car
 up
 with


gas.
 You
 know,
 reading
 is
 like
 filling


the
 car
 up.
 Writing
 is
 like
 driving
 and


going
 on
 a
 journey.
 And
 you
 need
 both.


You
 know,
 like
 the
 point
 is
 not
 just
 to


sit
 at
 the
 gas
 station
 all
 day
 and
 keep


filling
 the
 car
 up.
 Like
 the
 tank
 is


already
 full.
 Yeah.
 You
 should
 go
 go
 out


and
 see
 something.
 But
 if
 you
 just
 keep


driving,
 you
 end
 up
 stranded
 on
 the
 side


of
 the
 road.
 And
 so
 for
 me,
 reading
 is


the
 primary
 way
 that
 I
 generate


inspiration
 and
 ideas.
 Almost
 every


thought
 that
 you
 have
 is
 downstream
 from


what
 you
 consume.
 It's
 so
 rare.
 There's


there's
 even
 a
 debate
 among


neuroscientists
 whether
 it's
 even


possible
 to
 have
 a
 spontaneous
 thought,


truly
 spontaneous
 thought.


>> You
 know,
 you
 say
 something
 to
 me
 or
 ask


me
 a
 question
 and
 that
 sparks
 a
 thought


or
 somebody
 cuts
 you
 off
 in
 traffic
 and


that
 makes
 you
 feel
 a
 certain
 way
 or


whatever.
 But
 it's
 just
 an
 endless


string
 of
 you
 responding
 to
 the


situations
 and
 inputs
 that
 come
 to
 you


throughout
 the
 day.
 So,
 we
 don't
 usually


give
 it
 this
 amount
 of
 weight,
 but
 when


you
 choose
 who
 you
 follow
 on
 social


media,
 when
 you
 choose
 what
 podcasts
 to


listen
 to,
 when
 you
 choose
 what
 books
 to


read,
 you
 are
 choosing
 your
 future


thoughts.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 if
 you
 want
 better,
 more
 productive,


more
 creative
 thoughts,
 you
 need
 better,


more
 productive,
 more
 creative
 inputs.


And
 so,
 uh,
 choosing
 what
 to
 read
 or


choosing
 what
 to
 listen
 to
 or
 who
 to


subscribe
 to
 is
 actually
 a
 very
 weighty


decision.
 And
 it's
 a
 very
 important


decision.
 Um


I
 I
 find
 that
 my
 reading
 habit
 now


there's
 there's
 some
 quote
 about
 Emerson


I
 think
 where
 he
 says
 he
 reads
 like
 a


hawk
 flying
 over
 a
 field
 scanning
 for


prey.
 Um
 and
 I
 kind
 of
 feel
 like
 that's


how
 I
 read
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 time.
 I'm
 almost


reading
 for
 like
 ideas
 or
 for
 chapters,


not
 for
 books.
 You
 know,
 I'm
 looking
 for


the
 piece
 that
 is
 relevant
 to
 what
 I'm


writing
 about
 at
 the
 time
 or
 what
 I'm


trying
 to
 learn
 at
 the
 time.
 uh
 I'm
 not


just
 sitting
 down
 and
 saying
 well
 let
 me


read
 and
 unpack
 this
 argument
 for
 fun.
 I


maybe
 when
 I
 do
 if
 I
 am
 at
 a
 stage
 in
 my


life
 at
 some
 point
 where
 I'm
 doing
 less


writing
 maybe
 I
 will
 read
 for
 that
 that


way
 more
 you
 know
 just
 for
 enjoyment
 or


for
 uh
 knowledge
 for
 knowledge's
 sake


but
 right
 now
 I'm
 kind
 of
 reading
 more


for
 knowledge
 uh
 for
 an
 outcome
 which
 is


for
 me
 to
 distill
 it
 and
 apply
 it
 in


some
 actionable
 way
 and
 then
 share
 it


with
 the
 world.


>> So
 what
 does
 that
 look
 like?
 Like
 you're


reading
 a
 book,
 are
 you
 highlighting?


Are
 you
 taking
 that
 highlight
 and


putting
 it
 into
 like
 a
 word
 document?


Like
 if
 I
 read
 a
 book
 that's
 really
 good


and
 relevant
 to
 what
 I'm
 working
 on
 at


the
 time,
 it's
 very
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 make


progress
 on
 it.
 I
 will
 it
 might
 take
 me


like
 seriously
 I
 might
 spend
 I
 mean
 at


this
 point
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 working
 as
 much


cuz
 we
 have
 all
 these
 kids.
 But
 um
 uh


but
 I
 like
 it
 might
 take
 me
 four
 hours


to
 get
 through
 three
 pages
 like
 because


there's
 I'm
 reading
 I'm
 at
 a
 point
 in


the
 book
 where
 it's
 just
 really
 hitting


on
 what
 I've
 been
 like
 kind
 of
 stewing


on
 and
 thinking
 about
 and
 it's
 sparking


ideas.
 So
 I'll
 read
 a
 sentence
 or
 a


paragraph
 and
 I'm
 like
 I
 got
 to
 write


about
 this
 for
 a
 second
 and
 then
 I
 you


know
 I
 I
 may
 end
 up
 writing
 two
 pages


and
 then
 I
 go
 back
 and
 I
 read
 some
 more


and
 then
 I
 you
 know
 write
 some
 more.
 um


when
 it's
 not
 as
 intense
 as
 that
 uh
 then


it'll
 be
 more
 what
 I
 do
 is
 I
 I
 prefer
 to


read
 physical
 books.
 I
 also
 audio
 can


also
 be
 helpful
 for
 me
 especially
 if
 I'm


in
 the
 car
 a
 lot
 or
 something.
 It's
 just


a
 you
 know
 obviously
 it's
 a
 better
 way


to
 do
 that
 but
 um
 it
 can
 be
 helpful
 for


me
 especially
 if
 a
 book
 is
 kind
 of


dense.
 I
 find
 audio
 is
 better
 because
 it


doesn't
 if
 the
 book
 is
 really
 dense,
 I


will
 slow
 myself
 down
 too
 much
 as
 I'm


reading
 it
 in
 print,
 but
 audio
 just


keeps
 rolling
 and
 I
 still
 get
 the
 idea,


but
 I
 don't
 slow
 myself
 down
 through
 the


writing.
 So,
 I
 find
 some
 authors
 to
 be


better
 for
 me
 in
 audio.
 But,
 um,
 my


preference
 is
 to
 read
 the
 physical
 book


as
 I
 roll
 through.
 I
 find
 passages
 that


interest
 me
 and
 I
 put
 a
 parenthesy
 open


parenthesis
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the


passage,
 close
 it
 at
 the
 end
 and
 then
 I


put
 a
 star
 in
 the
 margin
 so
 that
 if
 I


just
 leaf
 through
 the
 book,
 I
 find
 the


stars
 and
 I
 can
 easily
 identify
 those


passages.


>> And
 then
 once
 I
 finish
 the
 book,
 I
 will


go
 back
 through
 and
 take
 photos
 of
 each


of
 those
 and
 highlight
 the
 photo
 uh
 on


my
 iPhone
 and
 just
 copy
 and
 paste
 it


into
 uh
 like
 an
 Evernote
 file
 or
 you


know,
 Google
 Doc
 or
 wherever
 I'm
 storing


that
 stuff
 at.
 So,
 um,
 that's
 my
 typical


approach.
 So,
 I
 that's
 how
 I
 end
 up
 with


like
 usually
 if
 I
 read
 a
 book
 that
 I


highlight
 a
 lot
 on,
 maybe
 it'll
 have
 50


or
 something
 passages
 and
 all
 those
 get


dumped
 in
 at
 the
 end.


>> I
 just
 have
 to
 ask
 one
 follow-up
 to


that,
 which
 is
 and
 then
 what?
 So,
 it


goes
 into
 Evernote.
 Now,
 a
 lot
 of
 people


do
 this.
 They
 capture
 these
 notes,
 but


then
 they
 never
 Yeah.


>> revisit
 them.
 They
 never
 do
 anything


with
 them.


>> I
 don't
 like
 having
 I
 I
 tried
 this
 for
 a


while.
 I've
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 I've
 been


>> Evernote.
 I've
 been
 well
 I've
 been
 doing


it
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 Um
 it's
 just
 it's


just
 12
 years
 old,
 you
 know.
 Um
 Notion


wasn't
 even
 around
 when
 I
 was
 getting


started.
 But
 um
 so
 I
 just
 have
 a
 lot
 of


stuff
 in
 there
 now.
 But
 um


I
 tried
 for
 a
 little
 while
 doing
 it


based
 on
 the
 book.
 So
 I
 would
 I
 would


finish
 a
 book
 and
 then
 I
 would
 put
 all


the
 highlights
 into
 the
 book
 dock,
 you


know,
 and
 so
 I
 just
 have
 all
 the
 notes


from
 that
 book
 in
 one
 place.
 Um,
 but


what
 happened
 was
 what
 you
 just


described,
 which
 is
 then
 it
 would
 just


sit
 there
 and
 I
 would
 never
 really
 look


at
 it.
 Occasionally
 I
 would
 work
 on
 an


article
 and
 I
 would
 like
 search
 for


terms
 in
 Evernote
 and
 then
 find
 a


passage
 from
 a
 book
 and
 maybe
 pull
 it
 in


or
 something,
 but
 it
 was
 pretty
 rare


that
 that
 would
 happen.
 Instead,
 what
 I


find
 more
 useful
 now
 is
 to
 have
 a


project
 that
 I'm
 working
 on
 and
 a
 um
 a


dock
 for
 the
 project.
 So
 like
 the
 next


book
 I'm
 writing
 for
 example
 and
 then


I'm
 reading
 books
 that
 are
 relevant
 to


that
 project
 and
 I
 take
 the
 passages
 and


I
 drop
 them
 into
 the
 appropriate
 place


in
 that
 doc.
 So
 usually
 the
 way
 that
 I


start
 writing
 a
 book
 I
 try
 to
 have
 the


concept
 the
 big
 picture
 concept
 nailed


at
 the
 start.
 Like
 I
 knew
 Atomic
 Habits


was
 going to
 be
 a
 habits
 book
 from
 the


beginning.
 It
 was
 going
 to
 be
 a
 book


about
 building
 good
 habits
 and
 breaking


bad
 ones.
 So
 that
 can
 go
 at
 the
 top
 of


the
 dock.


>> Then
 I
 start
 at
 first
 at
 the
 very
 very


beginning
 I
 just
 collect
 notes
 and


ideas.
 It's
 just
 and
 maybe
 it
 gets
 to
 be


20
 or
 30
 pages
 and
 it's
 just
 a
 bunch
 of


random
 stuff.
 But
 eventually
 once
 you


get
 enough
 material
 in
 there,
 I
 start


grouping
 it
 by
 section
 and
 eventually


those
 sections
 become
 chapter
 chapters.


And
 that's
 usually
 for
 most
 of
 the


process
 that's
 usually
 what
 the
 doc


looks
 like
 is
 it's
 just
 sort
 of
 a


loosely
 structured
 chapter.
 This
 is
 a


chapter
 about
 leverage.
 This
 is
 a


chapter
 about
 tailwinds.
 This
 is,
 you


know,
 whatever.
 And
 when
 I
 read
 and
 I


have
 something
 that's
 relevant
 to
 a


chapter,
 it
 gets
 copied
 and
 pasted
 into


there.
 So
 it
 starts
 to
 the
 chapters
 end


up
 the
 part
 of
 my
 process
 that's
 that


part
 is
 just
 a
 lot
 of
 fun.
 What
 I
 just


described
 to
 you
 that
 that's
 just
 fun
 to


me.
 I
 get
 to
 read.
 I'm
 excited
 about
 it.


I
 dump
 it
 all
 in.
 It
 gets
 organized.


That
 that
 part
 can
 be
 great.


>> Um
 I
 have
 two
 manuscripts
 right
 now.
 One


is
 500
 pages,
 one
 is
 600
 pages.
 That
 is


just
 that.
 It's
 just
 a
 bunch
 of
 stuff


that
 I've
 read
 that
 is
 organized
 around


the
 book
 concept.
 The
 very
 unfun
 part
 is


taking
 it
 from
 600
 pages
 of
 roughly


organized
 notes
 and
 turning
 it
 into


chapters
 that
 can
 be
 readable.
 Um,
 and


it
 gets
 compressed
 along
 the
 way
 from


600
 pages
 down
 to
 200.
 And
 so
 that
 takes


a
 lot
 more
 work,


>> but
 that
 work
 is
 what
 makes
 it
 so
 easy


for
 the
 reader
 to
 read.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That's
 what
 makes
 it
 good.


Um,
 and
 that's
 that's
 also
 what's
 hard.


I
 mean,
 sometimes
 people
 will
 complain


and
 say,
 "Oh,
 you
 know,
 writing
 is


hard."
 And
 like,
 yeah,
 writing
 is
 hard,


but
 also
 that's
 kind
 of
 the
 point,
 you


know,
 like
 it's
 it's
 also
 like
 lifting.


It'd
 be
 like
 complaining
 about
 lifting


weights
 and
 the
 weights
 being
 heavy.


You're
 like,
 yes,
 the
 weights
 are
 heavy


and
 that's
 what's
 getting
 you
 stronger.


You
 know,
 like
 writing
 is
 hard
 because


it's
 making
 you
 a
 better
 thinker.
 It
 is


forcing
 you,
 the
 act
 of
 writing
 is


forcing
 you
 to
 clarify
 your
 thoughts.


The
 act
 of
 lifting
 the
 weight
 is
 forcing


your
 muscles
 to
 get
 stronger.
 And
 so,
 it


only
 works
 because
 it
 is
 hard.
 If
 it
 was


easy,
 it
 would
 not
 require
 much
 thought,


which
 means
 it
 also
 doesn't
 require
 much


reorganization
 in
 your
 mind,
 and
 you're


not
 learning
 very
 much
 or
 clarifying


very
 much.


>> After
 the
 success
 of
 Atomic
 Habits,
 the


inbound
 must
 be
 crazy.
 How
 do
 you


maintain
 the
 focus
 on
 the
 things
 that


you
 want
 with
 all
 these
 opportunities


available
 to
 you?


>> I'm
 kind
 of
 a
 slow
 learner,
 honestly.


Like,
 I
 it
 took
 me
 a
 while
 to
 figure
 it


out,
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 I
 have
 it


fully
 figured
 out
 now.
 it
 seems
 like
 the


bar
 keeps
 changing
 or
 moving.
 You
 know,


partially
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 good
 thing.
 If


you're
 really
 successful
 and
 things
 are


going
 well,
 then
 every
 year
 your


opportunity
 cost
 should
 increase.
 But


what
 that
 also
 means
 is
 every
 year
 you


should
 be
 saying
 no
 to
 things
 that
 you


were
 saying
 yes
 to
 the
 previous
 year.


And
 so
 I
 feel
 like
 I'm
 always
 3
 to
 6


months
 behind
 on
 what
 I
 should
 be
 saying


no
 to.
 Um,
 when
 the
 book
 came
 out,
 it
 it


did
 well
 from
 the
 start,
 but
 it
 really


didn't
 take
 off
 till
 about
 a
 year
 in.


So,
 it
 it
 hit
 the
 bestseller
 list
 the


first
 week,
 then
 nothing
 um
 until
 New


Year's
 week,
 and
 then
 nothing
 for
 like


six
 more
 months.
 And
 it
 wasn't
 really


till
 like
 the
 summer
 of
 the
 second
 year


that
 it
 started
 appearing
 every
 week.


Um,
 so
 2019
 was
 the
 year,
 2018
 it
 came


out,
 2019
 was
 the
 year
 that
 like


everything
 changed.
 And
 um
 there
 was
 a


stretch
 in
 like
 2019
 and
 early
 2020


where
 I
 just
 felt
 like
 I'm
 on
 the
 hook


for
 all
 these
 things
 that
 I
 should
 have


said
 no
 to.
 Um
 eventually
 I
 had
 to
 do


like
 harder
 things
 like
 put
 the
 email


inbox
 on
 an
 autoresponder
 and
 like
 uh


like
 that
 runs
 like
 kind
 of
 counter
 to


what
 I
 wanted
 to
 do,
 you
 know,
 like
 I


for
 the
 first
 10,000
 people
 who
 signed


up
 to
 my
 email
 list,
 I
 emailed
 each
 of


them
 individually
 and
 said
 like
 hey


thanks
 so
 much
 for
 joining,
 you
 know,


I'd
 love
 to
 have
 you
 in
 the
 community.


I'll
 be
 writing
 about
 this,
 you
 know,


whatever.
 And
 then,
 you
 know,
 you
 get
 to


100,000
 or
 a
 million
 or,
 you
 know,
 you


just
 can't
 do
 that
 stuff
 anymore.
 So,


um,
 yeah,
 it's
 like
 best
 possible


outcome,
 right?
 Like,
 you
 don't
 want
 to


complain
 about
 it.
 It's
 what
 could
 be


better.
 But,
 um,
 also
 it
 just
 takes
 a


lot
 of
 learning
 and
 reminding
 yourself


that
 you
 have
 to
 continue
 to
 increase


that
 filter.


>> Are
 there
 any
 lessons
 that
 you
 took
 away


that
 you
 wish
 you
 would
 have
 known


sooner
 about
 filtering
 or
 selecting


opportunities?
 There
 are
 lots
 of
 things


that
 I
 think
 about
 now
 strategically
 for


what
 I
 want
 to
 focus
 on
 that
 I
 didn't


really
 have
 a
 language
 for
 at
 the
 time.


You
 kind
 of
 like
 follow
 your
 gut
 or
 you


your
 intuition,
 but
 so
 I'll
 give
 you
 a


couple.
 Um,


not
 everything
 that
 you
 do
 can
 match
 all


the
 qualities
 that
 check
 all
 the
 boxes


that
 I'm
 about
 to
 cover,
 but
 I
 think


about
 each
 of
 these
 boxes
 and
 how
 do


they
 weave
 together?
 So
 like
 one
 thing


is
 leverage.
 How
 can
 I
 get
 more
 output


out
 of
 each
 unit
 of
 effort?
 And
 so
 some


things
 are
 much
 higher
 leverage
 than


others.
 You
 know,
 like
 writing,
 let's


just
 take
 writing
 as
 an example.
 Writing


in
 a
 journal
 or
 a
 diary
 is
 fine.
 It's


very
 useful
 for
 you.
 It
 might
 help
 you


think
 more
 clearly.
 Like
 writing
 has


lots
 of
 benefits.
 But
 if
 you
 choose
 to


take
 what
 you
 write
 and
 share
 it


publicly,
 well,
 now
 all
 of a
 sudden
 you


have a
 lot
 more
 leverage
 with
 that.


Other
 people
 can
 find
 it.
 It
 becomes


this
 kind
 of
 like
 honeypot
 that
 attracts


like-minded
 people.
 You
 know,
 I
 I
 like


to
 say
 that
 sharing
 your
 work
 publicly


is
 like
 a
 magnet
 and
 it
 just
 draws
 other


people
 to
 you
 who
 are
 interested
 in
 the


same
 thing.
 It's
 probably
 one
 of
 the


most
 useful
 things
 you
 can
 do
 for


networking
 is
 it's
 not
 actually


networking.
 It's
 just
 sharing
 your


knowledge
 and
 trying
 to
 be
 useful
 in


public.
 Um
 so
 leverage
 is
 one
 thing
 to


think
 about.
 How
 can
 I
 get
 more
 output


out
 of
 the
 hours
 that
 I'm
 putting
 in?
 Um


one
 question
 that
 I
 really
 like
 is
 what


is
 the
 work
 that
 keeps
 working
 for
 me


once
 it's
 done?
 Mhm.


>> So
 like
 doing
 this
 podcast
 interview
 is


a
 good
 example.
 I
 when
 Atomic
 Habits


came
 out
 I
 did
 like
 200
 interviews
 in


like
 6
 months
 and
 um
 some
 were
 podcast


and
 some
 are
 radio
 and
 I
 don't
 really
 do


radio
 interviews
 anymore.
 And
 it's
 not


really
 cuz
 I
 have
 something
 personal


against
 radio.
 It's
 just
 that
 once
 we


get
 done
 with
 that
 5
 minute
 segment
 or


10-minute
 segment,
 we're
 off
 the
 air
 and


that
 work
 is
 not
 working
 for
 me
 anymore.


You
 know,
 the
 the
 time
 I
 just
 put
 in


evaporated.
 But
 this
 will
 get
 recorded,


you
 know,
 and
 somebody
 will
 watch
 it


today
 and
 then
 somebody
 will
 watch
 it
 in


a
 month.
 And
 you
 know,
 it's
 um
 it's


almost
 like
 there's
 two
 versions
 of


James
 out
 there.
 You
 know,
 there's
 like


the
 version
 that's
 out
 there
 living
 his


daily
 life
 and
 then
 there's
 the
 one
 that


got
 recorded
 right
 now
 that
 can
 keep


working
 each
 hour
 after
 it's
 done.
 So


that's
 that's
 one
 filter.
 Another
 thing


that
 I
 think
 about
 is
 sequencing.
 So


doing
 things
 in
 the
 right
 order
 or
 doing


things
 in
 an
 order
 where
 it
 accumulates


for
 you.
 I
 debated
 about
 whether
 to


self-publish
 Atomic
 Habits
 or


traditionally
 publish
 for
 like
 a
 year,


year
 and
 a
 half.
 I
 I
 was
 like
 really


close
 to
 trying
 to
 self-publish.
 Um,
 and


ultimately
 at
 the
 time,
 it's
 a
 little


bit
 easier
 now,
 but
 still
 quite
 hard
 to


hit
 a
 bestseller
 list
 as
 if
 you're


self-published.
 And
 I
 decided,
 well,
 if


I'm
 really
 going
 to
 go
 for
 it
 and
 try
 to


hit
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 list,
 I
 might
 as


well
 do
 it
 with
 my
 first
 book
 because


then
 I
 can
 be
 a
 New
 York
 Times


bestselling
 author
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 my


career.
 Um,
 there's
 no
 guarantee
 I
 was


going to
 do
 it,
 but
 it's
 like
 if
 you're


going
 to
 try,
 you
 might
 as
 well
 try


early
 and
 then
 you
 can
 get
 the
 benefit


of
 that
 status
 marker
 for
 the
 next
 50


years
 rather
 than
 self-publishing
 your


first
 like
 five
 books
 and
 then
 doing
 it,


you
 know,
 in
 20
 years.
 So,
 that's
 just


kind
 of
 a,
 you
 know,
 a
 sequencing
 thing.


The
 other
 thing
 that
 I
 think
 about
 a
 lot


is
 how
 do
 I
 like
 it
 when
 the
 work
 that


I'm
 doing,
 every
 project
 that
 I'm


touching
 feeds
 each
 other
 in
 some
 way.


They
 kind
 of
 like
 cross-pollinate.
 Um
 so


a
 few
 examples
 I
 you
 know
 I'm
 writing


there's
 there's
 uh
 it's
 almost
 fractal


the
 way
 that
 you
 can
 think
 about
 this.


So
 like
 the
 small
 version
 is
 I
 write
 an


idea
 that
 idea
 could
 go
 on
 Twitter
 and


be
 used
 as
 a
 tweet.
 It
 could
 be
 in
 a


newsletter
 that
 I
 publish
 each
 week.
 It


could
 get
 repurposed
 onto
 Instagram
 as


like
 a
 quote
 card
 or
 something.
 Maybe
 if


it's
 good
 it
 could
 become
 the
 seed
 of


something
 that's
 a
 chapter
 in
 a
 book
 or


whatever.
 But
 it
 gets
 repurposed
 in
 lots


of
 ways.
 So
 that
 one
 hour
 again
 kind
 of


like
 leverage
 it's
 working
 for
 you
 in


more
 ways.
 How
 does
 it
 how
 does
 it


accumulate?
 How
 does
 it
 cross-pollinate?


You
 can
 also
 do
 it
 with
 platforms.
 So


like
 all
 of
 the
 platforms
 that
 I
 have


for
 my
 business
 point
 to
 each
 other,
 you


know,
 like
 when
 I
 post
 on
 Instagram,
 at


the
 bottom
 of
 each
 post
 says,
 you
 know,


want
 to
 learn
 more
 ideas
 like
 this?
 Sign


up
 for
 the
 newsletter
 at


jamesclair.com321


or
 go
 to
 jamesclair.com
 for
 more.
 Um
 the


book
 points
 to
 things.
 you
 know,
 you


read
 Atomic
 Habits
 and
 then
 at
 the
 end


of
 each
 section
 it
 says,
 you
 know,
 if


you
 want
 to
 get
 a
 PDF
 guide
 that


summarizes
 these
 key
 ideas,
 go
 to


atomichabits.com
 and,
 you
 know,
 you
 can


download
 it
 or
 whatever.
 So,
 the
 book's


pointing
 to
 the
 website,
 the
 website's


pointing
 to
 the
 book,
 the
 newsletter
 is


pointing
 to
 social
 media,
 social
 media


is
 pointing
 to
 the
 newsletter.
 It's
 all


like
 this
 web
 where
 everything
 is
 kind


of
 cross-pollinating.


I
 think
 some
 people
 that
 people
 get
 that


and
 they
 do
 it
 like
 once
 or
 twice
 or


seven
 times,
 but
 like
 you
 need
 to
 do
 it


every
 time,
 you
 know,
 like
 you're


building
 this
 very
 tight
 web.
 It's


you're
 building
 this
 network
 of
 things


that
 all
 accumulate
 together.
 And
 then


you
 can
 do
 it
 at
 an
 even
 larger
 level.


So
 like
 we
 we
 have
 the
 the
 writing
 idea,


the
 tweet
 idea,
 you
 have
 the
 platform


idea
 that's
 still
 within
 one
 business,


but
 you
 can
 even
 do
 it
 across


businesses.
 It's
 like
 I
 have
 my
 business


as
 a
 writer,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 an
 author
 and


I
 have
 my
 platforms,
 but
 I
 also


co-founded
 a
 publishing
 company,


Author's
 Equity.
 And
 so
 now
 the
 brand


that
 I
 have
 as
 an
 author
 helps
 me
 meet


other
 authors
 and
 talk
 to
 them.
 And
 if


it's
 a
 good
 fit,
 they
 can
 come
 and


publish
 with
 us.
 And
 so
 those
 two
 things


feed
 each
 other.
 I
 publish
 my
 books


through
 Author's
 Equity.
 Like
 it's,
 you


know,
 it's
 a
 way
 for
 those
 two


businesses
 to
 help
 each
 other.
 Um,
 and


then
 I
 have
 a
 I
 even
 have
 like
 a
 side


project
 which
 is
 this
 cabin
 in
 the
 woods


that
 I
 I
 built.
 you
 know,
 are
 building


this
 cabin
 and
 it
 can
 be
 a
 retreat


center
 for
 authors,
 you
 know,
 like
 we


can
 bring
 authors
 out
 there
 and
 we
 can


meet
 for
 two
 or
 three
 days
 and
 talk


about
 how
 to
 write
 books
 and
 launch


books
 and
 build
 your
 platform
 and
 some


of
 those
 people
 can
 publish
 with
 authors


equity
 and
 you
 can
 like
 see
 how


everything
 kind
 of
 feeds
 each
 each


other.
 So,
 it
 doesn't
 all
 work
 perfectly


together
 like
 that
 every
 time,
 but
 I


like
 when
 things
 can
 kind
 of
 check


multiple
 boxes.
 And
 then
 one
 of
 the
 one


of
 the
 other
 ones
 that
 I'll
 mention
 and


then
 I'll
 take
 a
 break
 for
 a
 second
 is


um
 tailwinds.
 So
 like
 I
 always
 think


about
 email
 lists.
 I
 don't
 we
 you
 know


you
 and
 I
 both
 have
 lots
 of
 friends
 who


have
 email
 lists
 and
 people
 are
 growing


at
 different
 rates,
 but
 basically


everybody
 I
 know's
 list
 is
 getting


bigger.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 I
 know


anybody
 whose
 list
 is
 shrinking.
 Um


unless
 it's
 like
 they're
 intentionally,


you
 know,
 trimming
 subscribers
 or


something.
 But
 uh
 more
 and
 more
 people


come
 online
 each
 day.
 More
 there
 still


are
 like
 you
 know
 a
 billion
 people
 in


the
 world
 that
 need
 internet
 access
 and


are
 coming
 on.
 So
 there's
 just
 this
 huge


tailwind
 of
 readers
 that
 and
 the


internet
 continues
 to
 grow
 and
 people


continue
 to
 subscribe
 to
 things.
 And
 so


it's
 just
 a
 good
 like
 place
 to
 play
 um


because
 there
 are
 lots
 of
 forces
 working


for
 you.
 So
 if
 you
 put
 all
 of
 those


things
 together
 you're
 like
 all
 right


there's
 a
 big
 tailwind
 on
 the
 internet


and
 building
 an
 audience.
 If
 you
 share


your
 work
 publicly,
 you
 gain
 leverage


and
 you
 can
 attract
 more
 people
 to
 your


work
 and
 you
 can,
 you
 know,
 become
 more


known
 or
 your
 work
 can
 get
 out
 there.


Um,
 if
 your
 platforms
 cross-pollinate,


they
 can
 kind
 of
 grow
 each
 other.
 That


same
 dynamic
 of
 a
 tailwind
 for,
 you


know,
 email
 list
 is
 also
 true
 for
 social


media
 and,
 you
 know,
 other
 platforms


online.
 And
 if
 you
 do
 this
 early
 in
 your


life
 and
 you
 build
 an
 audience
 early,


then
 you
 have
 tons
 of
 flexibility
 and


how
 you
 can
 use
 that
 and
 where
 you
 can


direct
 the
 attention
 or
 what
 you
 know


what
 businesses
 you
 want
 to
 build
 or


what
 projects
 you
 want
 to
 work
 on.
 So


all
 of
 that
 collectively
 just
 makes
 it


feel
 like
 all
 right,
 if
 you're
 doing


things
 that
 are
 in
 that
 zone,
 then
 it's


probably
 a
 really
 high
 leverage
 way
 to


spend
 your
 time.
 And
 I'm
 not
 saying


that's
 the
 only
 way
 you
 should
 spend


your
 time.
 Probably
 the
 the
 single


biggest
 thing
 that
 we
 haven't
 talked


about
 is
 are
 you
 excited
 about
 it?
 You


know,
 are
 you
 interested?
 are
 you


passionate
 about
 it?
 But
 um
 those
 are


some
 of
 the
 ways
 that
 I
 think
 about


focus
 and
 prioritization
 and
 selecting


and
 when
 things
 blew
 up,
 you
 know,
 we


put
 all
 this
 together
 and
 Atomic
 Habits


did
 really
 well.
 And
 then
 when
 things


blew
 up
 and
 my
 time
 got
 tight,
 you're


like,
 "Okay,
 you
 have
 all
 these."
 It


felt
 like
 for
 10
 years
 it
 was
 me
 trying


to
 knock
 on
 every
 door
 and
 window
 and
 be


like, "Hey,
 will
 you
 please
 pay


attention?
 Maybe
 like
 can
 you
 read


this?"
 And
 then
 all
 of
 a
 sudden


overnight
 it
 was
 like,
 whoa,
 way
 too


many
 people
 are
 paying
 attention.
 Um,


and
 so
 now
 I
 have
 to
 be
 more
 strict


about
 which
 things
 check
 those
 boxes
 and


where
 where
 I
 direct
 my
 time
 and


attention.


>> I
 love
 a
 couple
 of
 the
 themes
 we
 talked


about.
 I
 just
 want
 to
 circle
 back
 to


longevity
 of
 content.


>> Um,
 we
 published
 an
 interview
 this


summer,
 republished
 an
 interview
 that


was
 recorded
 six
 years
 ago


>> and
 nobody
 had
 any
 idea.
 So
 when
 you


think
 of
 like
 content
 and
 the
 long
 tail


of
 it,
 it's
 really
 fascinating.
 We
 don't


talk
 politics.
 We
 don't
 talk
 anything


topical.
 One
 of
 the
 reasons
 we
 do
 that


is
 we
 have
 great
 longevity
 of
 content.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 think
 that
 that's
 really
 important.


>> So
 that's
 one
 that
 I
 didn't
 mention,
 but


I
 do
 think
 about
 a
 lot.
 This
 I
 think


this
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 my
 style
 and


what
 I'm
 interested
 in
 personally,
 but


it
 does,
 you
 know,
 there
 are
 ways
 that


you
 could
 apply
 it
 probably
 whatever


you're
 focused
 on,
 which
 is
 what's
 the


halflife
 of
 this
 idea.
 You
 know,
 you


want
 I
 like
 to
 work
 on
 things
 that
 have


a
 very
 long
 halflife.
 They
 they
 just


persist.
 And
 I
 even
 like
 to
 work
 in


formats
 that
 have
 a
 long
 half-life.
 Like


social
 media
 has
 a
 very
 short
 half-life.


And
 that's
 fine.
 It
 can
 serve
 a
 role
 in


the
 business,
 but
 I'm
 never
 going
 to


make
 it
 my
 central
 thing
 because


something
 like
 a
 blog
 post
 has
 a
 little


bit
 longer
 halfife,
 but
 a
 book
 really


has
 a
 long
 halflife.
 And
 so,
 um,
 I
 like


formats
 that
 are
 durable
 and
 persist
 in


that
 way.
 And
 so,
 you
 can
 Yeah.
 you


start
 to
 put
 all
 those
 different


elements
 together
 and
 I
 think
 you
 can


end
 up
 with
 something
 that's
 pretty


evergreen.


>> One
 thing
 you
 mentioned
 that
 I
 thought


was
 really
 interesting
 was
 the
 word


sequencing


>> and
 I'm
 wondering
 how
 you
 think
 about


that
 in
 terms
 of
 accomplishing
 your


goals
 but
 also
 in
 terms
 of
 like


different
 eras
 of
 your
 life.


>> Are
 your
 20s
 different
 than
 your
 30s,


your
 30s
 and
 your
 40s
 and
 your
 40s
 and


your
 50s?


>> Yeah,
 that's
 a
 great
 question.
 I
 I
 don't


know
 why,
 but
 I've
 been
 thinking
 a
 lot


about
 this
 recently.
 I
 guess
 you
 could


call
 it
 like
 life
 strategy
 or
 something,


but
 think
 about
 most
 of
 the
 big
 really


meaningful
 things
 in
 your
 life,
 you


know,
 like
 um
 raising
 a
 family
 that


you're
 proud
 of,
 building
 a
 great


marriage,
 creating
 a
 successful
 company,


getting
 in
 the
 best
 shape
 of
 your
 life,


you
 know,
 starting
 some
 new
 initiative,


or
 you
 know,
 giving
 back
 in
 some
 big


way.
 Like
 whatever
 it
 is,
 it's
 probably


a
 multi-year
 thing.
 You
 know,
 all
 the


those
 really
 big
 meaningful
 movements
 in


life
 are
 three,
 five,
 10,
 sometimes


longer.
 you
 know,
 it's
 like
 it's
 a
 lot


of
 years.
 And
 if
 you
 just
 look
 broadly


at
 your
 adult
 life,
 you're
 like,
 well,


if
 I'm
 lucky
 enough
 to
 get
 to
 live
 to


say
 80,
 I've
 got
 maybe
 five
 or
 six
 of


those,
 you
 know,
 10-year
 movements
 in


there.
 Um,
 so
 what
 are
 you
 going
 to


spend
 those
 five
 or
 six
 on?
 You
 know,


they
 it's
 a
 limited
 number,
 whatever
 it


is.
 Some
 things
 five
 or
 six
 alone
 is


limited,
 but
 it's
 even
 more
 limited
 than


I
 think
 you
 realize
 at
 the
 beginning


because
 certain
 things
 don't
 make
 sense


in
 certain
 decades,
 you
 know,
 like
 if


you
 want
 to
 travel
 around
 the
 world
 for


a
 while
 and
 party
 in
 a
 visa,
 like
 you


probably
 aren't
 going to
 do
 that
 in
 your


70s,
 you
 know,
 like
 it's
 probably
 better


for
 your
 20s
 or
 30s.
 And
 um
 so
 the


sequencing
 of
 things
 starts
 to
 to


matter,
 too.
 Um
 building
 a
 company,
 I


think,
 is
 another
 one.
 you
 can
 do
 it


whenever
 you
 want,
 you
 know,
 like


there's
 no
 there
 are
 no
 rules,
 but
 man,


it
 sure
 is
 nice
 to
 like
 do
 it
 early
 and


then
 you
 get
 some
 of
 the
 advantages
 of


that
 uh
 as
 you
 go
 on.
 It
 seems
 that


responsibilities


uh
 and
 obligations
 tend
 to
 increase


throughout
 life.
 Each
 day
 that
 goes
 by


is
 an
 opportunity
 for


>> a
 responsibility
 to
 come
 into
 play
 or
 an


obligation
 or
 an
 obstacle
 that
 you


didn't
 foresee
 to
 come
 up.
 And
 so,
 if


you're
 waiting
 till
 your
 40s
 or
 50s
 to


start
 a
 company,
 again,
 there
 are
 no


rules.
 You
 can
 do
 it
 then.
 It's
 just


that
 you're
 playing
 the
 game
 on
 hard


mode
 a
 little
 bit
 uh
 or
 a
 harder
 mode.
 I


always
 say
 like
 I
 started
 my
 first


business
 when
 I
 was
 24


and
 I
 had
 no
 kids
 and
 I
 wasn't
 married.


It
 was
 as
 easy
 as
 it
 could
 be
 and
 it
 was


still
 really
 hard.
 Yeah.


>> Um
 you
 know
 so
 anyway
 that's
 I
 I
 think


about
 sequencing
 in
 that
 way.
 Um
 and


some
 of
 the
 questions
 I
 like
 to
 ask
 to


there
 are
 two
 that
 really
 feel
 relevant


to
 this.
 The
 first
 is
 what
 season
 am
 I


in
 right
 now?
 You
 know,
 life
 has


different
 seasons
 and
 um
 sometimes


you
 want
 to
 focus
 on
 earning
 money.


Sometimes
 you
 want
 to
 focus
 on
 time
 with


family.
 Sometimes
 you
 want
 to
 focus
 on


creativity
 or
 you
 know
 creative
 freedom,


the
 ability
 to
 choose
 what
 projects
 you


work
 on.
 Sometimes
 you
 just
 want
 it
 to


be
 a
 personal
 season,
 you
 know,
 and
 it's


less
 about
 work.
 But
 whatever
 the
 answer


is,
 it's
 probably
 really
 specific
 to


you.
 And
 um
 it
 helps
 to
 figure
 out
 what


season
 you're
 in
 right
 now
 because
 when


your
 seasons
 change,
 your
 habits
 often


need
 to
 change.
 You
 know,
 what
 you
 focus


on
 often
 needs
 to
 change.
 And
 so
 the
 the


question
 that
 I
 think
 is
 closely
 tied
 to


this,
 which
 is
 a
 a
 good
 one
 from
 Derek


Civers,
 is
 what
 am
 I
 optimizing
 for


right
 now?
 And
 so
 I,
 you
 know,
 if
 I


don't
 know
 what
 to
 optimize
 for,
 I
 feel


like
 it's
 good
 to
 optimize
 for


enthusiasm.
 What
 lights
 me
 up?
 But


whatever
 that
 answer
 is
 right
 now,
 what


are
 you
 optimizing
 for?
 It
 helps
 you


determine
 what
 season
 you're
 in.
 And
 I


found
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 time
 when
 I'm


struggling
 or
 I'm
 facing
 some
 sort
 of
 uh


I
 feel
 like
 I'm
 facing
 a
 lot
 of


friction,
 it's
 because
 I'm
 trying
 to


force
 fit
 old
 habits
 into
 a
 new
 season.


You
 know,
 I
 keep
 I
 keep
 trying
 to
 do


things
 the
 way
 I
 was
 doing
 it
 and
 then


eventually
 I
 realize,
 oh,
 okay,
 stop


being
 a
 dummy
 about
 this.
 Like
 you're
 in


a
 new
 season
 now.
 So,
 I
 think
 sequencing


um
 starts
 with
 self-awareness.
 It
 starts


with
 knowing
 what
 season
 you're
 in
 and


what
 you're
 optimizing
 for,
 what's


important
 to
 you
 at
 this
 stage
 of
 your


life.
 And
 then
 once
 you
 realize
 that,


you
 can
 start
 to
 figure
 out,
 you
 know,


which
 pieces
 should
 I
 focus
 on
 next.


>> Let's
 explore
 habits
 a
 little.
 Um,
 what


exactly
 is
 a
 habit?


>> The
 one
 one
 that
 I
 like
 is
 that
 a
 habit


is
 a
 recurring
 solution
 to
 a
 recurring


problem
 in
 your
 environment.
 So


something
 comes
 up
 again
 and
 again
 and


your
 brain
 is
 trying
 to
 solve
 it.


Another
 way
 to
 describe
 it
 is
 that
 it's


like
 an
 automatic
 or
 a
 mindless


behavior.
 If
 we
 were
 talking
 to
 a


researcher
 or
 an
 academic,
 they
 would


probably
 say
 a
 habit
 is
 like
 brushing


your
 teeth
 or
 tying
 your
 shoes
 or
 biting


your
 nails,
 you
 know,
 something
 you
 do


really
 fast
 and
 mindlessly
 and
 you
 don't


even
 really
 think
 about
 it.
 But
 if
 I


were
 to
 ask
 you,
 hey
 Shane,
 what
 are


some
 habits
 you're
 trying
 to
 build?
 Like


you're
 probably
 going
 to
 say,
 oh,
 you


know,
 I'm
 trying
 to
 go
 to
 the
 gym
 four


days
 a
 week
 or
 I
 want
 to
 write
 every
 day


or
 I'm
 trying
 to
 meditate
 for
 10
 minutes


or
 something
 like
 that.
 And
 I
 know
 what


you
 mean
 when
 you
 say
 that.
 You
 know,


you
 mean
 you
 want
 it
 to
 be
 this
 regular


practice,
 this
 ritual.
 Now,
 technically,


in
 some
 kind
 of
 academic
 sense,
 maybe


that's
 not,
 you
 know,
 a
 habitual


automatic
 behavior.
 But
 in
 a
 cultural


sense,
 that's
 exactly
 what
 we
 mean
 when


we
 talk
 about
 habits
 is
 we
 want
 them
 to


be
 reliable
 repeated
 routines.
 And
 then


the
 third
 way
 you
 could
 define
 it,
 and


this
 one
 I
 think
 is
 quite
 useful,
 is


that
 it's
 a
 behavior
 that
 is
 tied
 to
 a


context
 in
 your
 environment.
 behav


behavior
 that's
 tied
 to
 a
 particular


context.
 So
 like
 your
 habit
 of
 watching


Netflix
 at
 7
 p.m.
 is
 tied
 to
 the
 context


of
 your
 house
 and
 your
 couch
 at
 that


time
 of
 day.
 And
 so
 um
 what
 we
 start
 to


see
 is
 that
 behaviors
 have
 a
 very
 strong


link
 between
 environment
 and
 context.


And
 that's
 a
 good
 way
 to
 adjust


behaviors.
 But
 I
 think
 all
 of
 those
 are


are
 potential
 ways
 to
 define
 what
 a


habit
 is.
 Ultimately,
 it's
 really
 just


your
 brain
 trying
 to
 automate
 the


problems
 and
 solutions
 of
 life
 and
 do


things
 with
 more
 efficiency.
 You


mentioned
 seasons
 and
 tying
 that
 to


habits.
 I'm
 wondering
 how
 do
 we
 know
 if


a
 habit
 is
 working
 for
 us
 or
 if
 it's


working
 against
 us.


>> There's
 some
 debate
 among
 researchers


about
 is
 there
 even
 such
 a
 thing
 as
 a


good
 habit
 or
 a
 bad
 habit?
 Like
 all


habits
 serve
 you
 in
 some
 way.
 You
 know,


you
 smoke
 a
 cigarette
 because
 it
 serves


or
 resolves
 some,
 you
 know,
 need
 that


you
 have.
 Uh,
 and
 I
 understand
 what


they're
 saying,
 but
 I
 think
 that
 we
 all


know
 what
 we
 mean
 when
 we
 say
 a
 good


habit
 or
 a
 bad
 habit.
 And
 the
 way
 that
 I


like
 to
 define
 it
 is
 that
 the
 cost
 of


your
 good
 habits
 is
 in
 the
 present.
 The


cost
 of
 your
 bad
 habits
 is
 in
 the


future.
 And
 so
 what
 you
 find
 is
 that
 a


lot
 of
 things
 that
 typically
 get


categorized
 as
 a
 bad
 habit,
 eating
 too


many
 donuts
 or
 smoking
 a
 cigarette
 or


something
 like
 that
 feels
 good
 in
 the


moment,
 but
 it
 creates
 some
 kind
 of
 cost


or
 consequence
 in
 the
 future.
 Um
 whereas


a
 lot
 of
 good
 habits,
 going
 to
 the
 gym


right
 now,
 it
 requires
 sweat
 and
 effort


and
 it's
 hard.
 It
 has
 a
 payoff
 in
 the


future.
 I
 think
 one
 way
 to
 determine


whether
 a
 habit
 is
 serving
 you
 or
 not
 is


is
 it
 giving
 me
 more
 of
 what
 I
 want
 in


the
 future
 or
 less
 of
 what
 I
 want.


>> It's
 almost
 like
 it's
 first
 order


negative,
 second
 order
 positive
 if
 it's


a
 good
 habit
 and
 then
 the
 inverse
 is


true.


>> I
 I
 think
 as
 a
 general
 rule
 that


probably
 can
 be
 true.
 The
 real
 trick
 is


to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 make
 it
 first
 order


positive
 and
 second
 order
 positive.
 And


you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 atomic
 habits
 is


about
 this,
 which
 is
 trying
 to
 make


habits
 as
 easy
 as
 possible
 to
 do
 so
 you


don't
 feel
 as
 much
 friction
 in
 the


moment
 while
 also
 aligning
 them
 with


your
 identity
 and
 the
 type
 of
 person


that
 you
 want
 to
 be.
 And
 so
 working
 out


is
 like
 a
 classic
 example,
 but
 everybody


wants
 to
 work
 out
 so
 that
 they
 look


better
 in
 the
 mirror
 and
 so
 that
 they


get
 fit.
 They
 want
 the
 the
 results
 of


it,
 which
 is
 fine.
 The
 second
 order


outcome
 is
 going
 to
 be
 great,
 but
 it's


hard
 in
 the
 moment
 and
 you
 don't
 always


feel
 like
 going
 and
 sometimes
 it's,
 you


know,
 difficult
 or
 whatever.
 The
 real


trick
 and
 where
 I
 have
 eventually
 gotten


to
 myself
 after
 10
 or
 15
 years
 of


training
 is
 I
 like
 how
 I
 feel
 when
 I'm


working
 out.
 And
 so
 it's
 not
 even
 I


yeah,
 I
 want
 the
 same
 results
 everybody


else
 does.
 But
 it's
 also
 about
 being
 the


type
 of
 person
 who
 doesn't
 miss


workouts.
 And
 I
 know
 that
 if
 I'm
 in
 the


middle
 of
 a
 set,
 I
 can
 feel
 good
 about


being
 that
 person
 and
 being
 who
 I
 am.
 So


now
 all
 I
 have
 to
 do
 is
 do
 the
 thing
 and


I
 don't
 have
 to
 wait
 for
 the
 outcome.


The
 outcomes
 are
 also
 good
 further
 down


the
 line,
 but
 it's
 more
 about
 showing
 up


and
 being
 that
 type
 of
 person.


>> Is
 there
 like
 a
 specific
 framework
 that


you
 use
 to
 evaluate
 if
 this
 habit
 is


serving
 you
 or
 getting
 in
 your
 way
 and


then
 you
 should
 replace
 it
 with
 a


different
 habit?


>> I
 said
 earlier
 that
 habits
 are
 the


repeated
 solutions
 to
 recurring
 problems


in
 your
 environment.
 Right?
 So,
 let's


say
 that
 you
 go
 to
 work
 and
 it's
 a
 long


day.
 You
 get
 home,
 it's
 like
 5:30
 or


6:00
 and
 you're
 exhausted.
 that
 happens


again
 and
 again
 and
 you
 feel
 tired
 after


a
 long
 day
 of
 work.
 So
 that
 is
 a


recurring
 problem
 that's
 resurfacing
 and


people
 have
 different
 solutions
 to
 that


problem.
 You
 know,
 one
 person
 might
 play


video
 games
 for
 30
 minutes,
 somebody


else
 might
 go
 for
 a
 run,
 a
 third
 person


might
 smoke
 a
 cigarette,
 but
 you
 can
 see


some
 of
 these,
 they're
 all
 solving
 the


same
 recurring
 problem,
 but
 some


solutions
 are
 better
 than
 others.
 And


what
 you
 find
 is
 that
 like
 early
 in
 your


life,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 solutions
 that
 you


come
 up
 with
 are
 just
 things
 that
 you


either
 inherited
 from
 your
 parents
 or


saw
 modeled
 and
 started
 to
 repeat.


>> And
 you
 get
 to
 be
 about
 22
 or
 25
 or


something
 like
 that.
 And
 what
 are
 the


odds
 that
 your
 current
 solution
 is
 the


best
 solution?


Just
 mathematically,
 it's
 very
 unlikely


that
 the
 way
 that
 you're
 solving
 the


repeated
 problems
 in
 your
 life
 right
 now


is
 the
 optimal
 way
 to
 do
 it.
 So
 as
 soon


as
 you
 have
 that
 realization,
 it
 becomes


your
 responsibility
 to
 try
 to
 figure
 out


a
 better
 way.
 And
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


best
 things
 you
 can
 do
 early
 on,
 this
 is


if
 I
 could
 actually
 add
 one
 thing
 to


atomic
 habits
 that
 wasn't
 in
 it,
 it


would
 probably
 be
 this,
 which
 is
 to
 ask,


what
 would
 this
 look
 like
 if
 it
 was
 fun?


You
 know,
 like
 for
 any
 habit
 that
 you're


trying
 to
 build,
 just
 sit
 down
 and
 ask,


"What
 would
 it
 look
 like
 if
 it
 was
 fun?"


And
 try
 to
 brainstorm
 10
 or
 20
 or
 50


different
 solutions
 to
 it.
 Um,


there's
 not
 always
 a
 thousand
 ways
 to
 do


everything,
 but
 there
 is
 almost
 always


more
 than
 one
 way.
 And
 so,
 a
 lot
 of


people,
 the
 most
 common
 New
 Year's


resolution
 is
 to
 go
 to
 the
 gym
 and
 work


out.


>> And
 I
 kind
 of
 feel
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 people


are
 in
 the
 gym
 in
 January
 just
 cuz
 they


feel
 like
 they
 should
 be
 in
 the
 gym
 or


society
 wants
 them
 to
 be
 in
 the
 gym
 or


something
 like
 that.


>> But
 we
 can
 come
 up
 with
 a
 long
 list
 of


what
 it
 looks
 like
 to
 live
 an
 active


lifestyle.
 You
 can
 rock
 climb
 or
 kayak


or,
 you
 know,
 do
 all
 kinds
 of
 stuff.
 Um,


and
 I
 think
 it's
 worth
 it
 to
 spend
 20


minutes
 and
 try
 to
 come
 up
 with
 that


list
 and
 then
 look
 at
 it
 and
 say,
 "Which


one
 of
 these
 sounds
 like
 the
 most
 fun
 to


me?"
 And
 so
 that
 helps
 I
 think
 that


helps
 you
 get
 closer
 to
 what
 the
 optimal


answer
 is
 for
 you.
 Because
 if
 it's
 not


fun,
 if
 it's
 not
 engaging
 or


interesting,
 if
 it
 doesn't
 feel
 good,


you're
 not
 going
 to
 stick
 with
 it
 when


it
 gets
 tough.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 probably


one
 of
 the
 great
 lessons
 for
 life,
 which


is
 if
 you're
 having
 fun,
 then
 then


you're
 dangerous,
 right?
 Then
 you're


hard
 to
 compete
 with.
 You
 don't
 want
 to


you
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 up
 against
 the


person
 who's
 having
 a
 good
 time
 doing
 it


because
 if
 it
 feels
 like
 a
 hassle
 or
 a


chore,
 that's
 the
 person
 who
 gives
 up


when
 it
 gets
 difficult.
 But
 the
 person


who's
 having
 a
 great
 time
 at
 the
 start,


they're
 much
 more
 likely
 to
 stick
 with


it
 when
 it
 gets
 hard.


>> Do
 you
 think
 of
 fun
 as
 binary
 or
 is
 it


how
 do
 I
 make
 I
 want
 to
 work
 out?
 So


like
 how
 do
 I
 make
 working
 out
 more
 fun


versus
 like
 fun?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 so
 Well,
 everything
 in
 your


life
 is
 not
 going
 to
 feel
 like
 going
 to


a
 concert
 or
 something,
 right?
 like
 it's


never
 going
 to
 be
 it
 may
 not
 be
 the
 most


fun
 thing
 in
 your
 day
 or
 something
 like


that,
 but
 anything
 can
 be
 more
 engaging


or
 more
 fun
 than
 maybe
 the
 default
 would


be.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 about
 it
 more
 like


that.
 How
 can
 I
 try
 to
 make
 this
 more


enjoyable?
 Not
 necessarily
 saying
 it's


going to
 be
 the
 most
 fun
 part
 of
 my
 day.


>> And
 then
 once
 we've
 identified
 a
 habit


that
 we
 want
 to
 replace
 or
 eliminate,


what
 is
 the
 mechanism
 by
 which
 we
 can
 do


that?


>> Broadly
 speaking,
 I
 think
 there
 are
 four


things
 that
 you
 should
 do
 if
 you
 want
 to


build
 a
 habit.
 And
 this
 is
 true
 if
 you


want
 to,
 you
 know,
 replace
 an
 old
 one


and
 install
 a
 new
 one.
 So,
 roughly


speaking,
 what
 you
 want
 is
 your
 habit
 to


be
 obvious.
 So,
 you
 want
 it
 to
 be
 easy


to
 see,
 easy
 to
 notice,
 easy
 to
 um,
 you


know,
 get
 your
 attention.
 You
 want
 it
 to


be
 attractive.
 So,
 something
 that's


appealing
 or
 fun
 to
 you,
 as
 we
 were
 just


saying.
 Um,
 you
 want
 it
 to
 be
 easy,


simple,
 frictionless,
 you
 know,
 easy
 to


apply
 and
 uh,
 install.
 And
 you
 want
 it


to
 be
 satisfying.
 The
 more
 enjoyable
 or


satisfying
 a
 habit
 is,
 the
 more
 likely


you
 are
 to
 stick
 with
 it
 in
 the
 future.


So,
 I
 call
 these
 the
 four
 laws
 of


behavior
 change.
 Make
 it
 obvious,
 make


it
 attractive,
 make
 it
 easy,
 make
 it


satisfying.
 And
 you
 don't
 need
 all
 four


every
 single
 moment
 of
 the
 day
 or
 every


habit
 that
 you
 build.
 But
 the
 more
 that


you
 have
 those
 four
 forces
 working
 for


you,
 the
 more
 likely
 you
 are
 to
 stick


with
 it.
 And
 in
 fact,
 we
 can
 actually


learn
 something
 very
 compelling
 about


our
 habits
 by
 looking
 at
 behaviors
 that


we
 often
 call
 bad
 or
 like
 that
 we
 waste


time
 on.
 And
 you
 see
 what
 do
 those


things
 have
 in
 common?
 they
 often
 are


very
 obvious,
 attractive,
 easy,
 and


satisfying.
 Those
 are
 the
 things
 that


get
 them
 to
 stick.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 like
 if


you
 just
 take
 scrolling
 social
 media
 for


example,
 it's
 obvious
 because
 your
 phone


is
 on
 you
 all
 the
 time.
 It's
 often
 the


first
 app
 that
 your
 thumb
 gravitates
 to


and
 you
 tap
 open.
 It's
 attractive


because
 the
 algorithm
 has
 curated


content
 for
 your
 very
 interests.
 Um,


it's
 e
 it's
 so
 easy
 that
 like
 a
 couple


years
 ago,
 Instagram
 when
 you
 would


scroll
 and
 somebody
 put
 up
 an
 album,


they
 and
 if
 you
 came
 back
 to
 Instagram


like
 five
 minutes
 later,
 if
 you
 had


already
 seen
 that
 post,
 they
 would
 auto


swipe
 to
 the
 second
 slide.
 So,
 you
 don't


you
 don't
 even
 need
 to
 use
 your
 thumb


anymore,
 right?
 They
 would
 just
 keep


showing
 you
 new
 content
 for
 you.
 They


were
 trying
 to
 make
 it
 that
 easy
 to


consume.
 And
 then
 it's
 satisfying


because
 it
 kind
 of
 satisfies
 the


interest
 that
 you
 have
 and
 so
 on.
 Um,


get
 that
 dopamine
 hit
 and
 whatever.
 So,


uh,


I'm
 not
 trying
 to
 like
 criticize


Instagram
 too
 much
 or
 anything,
 but
 I'm


just
 saying
 if
 you
 wonder
 why
 is
 it
 so


easy
 for
 me
 to
 do
 that,
 you
 know,


nobody's
 sitting
 around
 saying,
 "How
 can


I
 just
 find
 the
 willpower
 and
 the


motivation
 to
 check
 Instagram
 more?"
 You


know,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 saying,


"Oh,
 I
 wish
 I
 just
 had
 the
 willpower
 and


the
 discipline
 to
 go
 to
 the
 gym
 or


something
 like
 that."
 Well,
 you
 know,


one
 of
 these
 is
 obvious,
 attractive,


easy,
 and
 satisfying,
 and
 one
 of
 them
 is


not.
 And
 so
 you
 need
 to
 try
 to
 find
 ways


to
 make
 your
 habits
 more
 obvious,


attractive,
 easy,
 and
 satisfying.


>> And
 then
 the
 opposite
 being
 make
 the


ones
 that
 you
 don't
 want
 harder.


>> You
 just
 in
 you
 just
 invert
 each
 of


those
 four.
 So
 rather
 than
 making
 it


obvious,
 make
 it
 invisible.
 So


unsubscribe
 from
 emails.
 Don't
 keep
 junk


food
 in
 the
 house.
 For
 the
 social
 media


example,
 I
 have
 so
 I've
 done
 this
 for


the
 last
 year.
 I
 just
 deleted
 all
 social


media
 apps
 off
 my
 phone.
 And
 I
 what
 I


told
 myself
 was
 if
 you
 really
 want
 to


use
 them,
 you
 can
 just
 download
 them
 and


log
 in.
 And
 I
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 that


I've
 really
 done
 that
 that
 much,
 but


maybe
 I've
 done
 it
 once
 or
 twice.
 Um
 I


log
 in,
 I
 use
 it,
 and
 then
 I
 delete
 it


after
 I
 get
 done.
 So
 I
 log
 out
 and


delete
 it
 again.
 And
 then
 the
 next
 time


I
 want
 to
 use
 it,
 I
 got
 to
 download
 it


again.
 But
 it's
 just
 it's
 not
 obvious


anymore,
 you
 know.
 Um
 rather
 than
 making


it
 attractive,
 make
 it
 unattractive.


That
 one
 is
 the
 most
 difficult
 of
 the


four
 and
 probably
 the
 place
 that
 I
 would


recommend
 focusing
 on
 the
 least
 because


it's
 hard
 to
 change
 your
 desires.
 It's


hard
 to
 change
 your
 expectations
 about


what
 things
 are
 attractive
 and
 what
 are


not.
 It
 is
 possible.
 We
 can
 talk
 about


it
 if
 you
 want,
 but
 it's
 it's
 hard.
 The


third
 um
 is
 to
 make
 it
 difficult
 instead


of
 making
 it
 easy.
 So,
 increasing


friction,
 adding
 steps
 between
 you
 and


the
 behavior.
 Again,
 deleting
 the
 app


off
 the
 phone
 is
 a
 good
 example
 of
 that.


And
 then
 the
 fourth
 is
 rather
 than


making
 it
 satisfying,
 make
 it


unsatisfying.
 You
 need
 to
 layer
 on
 some


kind
 of
 consequence
 or
 cost
 to
 the


behavior.
 And
 um
 if
 you
 do
 those
 four


things,
 you're
 much
 more
 likely
 to


avoid.
 Before
 we
 keep
 going
 with
 habits,


I
 do
 want
 to
 take
 a
 little
 sidetrack


here
 into
 social
 media.
 And
 sure,


>> so
 you're
 not
 reading
 anything
 online.


You're
 sort
 of
 like
 ignoring
 all
 the


>> It's
 been
 awesome.
 It's
 It's
 been
 so


great.
 Um
 I
 It's
 one
 of
 those
 things


that
 I
 find
 that
 there
 are
 some
 changes


that
 sound
 easy,
 but
 actually
 are
 very


hard
 in
 practice,
 and
 then
 there's
 other


things
 that
 sound
 like
 they
 would
 be


difficult,
 but
 actually
 they're
 not
 hard


at
 all.
 The
 the
 hard
 part
 is
 convincing


yourself
 to
 do
 it.
 Um
 deleting
 social


media
 off
 my
 phone
 was
 one.
 I
 did
 that


for
 like
 a
 year.
 About
 six
 months
 in,
 I


was
 like,
 "What
 if
 I
 did
 it
 for
 email?"


And
 so,
 I
 deleted
 email
 off
 my
 phone.


That
 sounded
 like
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be


really
 hard
 to
 me,
 but
 it
 has
 been
 so
 so


much
 easier
 than
 I
 thought.
 Um,
 again,
 I


just
 have
 the
 same
 rule,
 which
 is
 if
 I


really
 need
 it,
 I'll
 download
 the
 app


and
 log
 into
 Gmail
 and
 do
 what
 I
 need
 to


do.
 And
 I,
 you
 know,
 I've
 only


downloaded
 it
 twice
 in
 the
 last
 like


year.
 Once
 I
 was
 at
 the
 airport
 and
 I


had
 to
 send
 an
 email
 before
 my
 flight


and
 the
 other
 time
 I
 was
 getting
 ready


to
 go
 to
 a
 show
 and
 I
 needed
 to
 download


the
 tickets
 while
 we
 were
 in
 line.
 Um,


but
 after
 I
 get
 done,
 I
 just
 delete
 the


app
 again
 and
 I'm
 like,
 well,
 I'll
 just


download
 it
 if
 I
 need
 it.
 And
 it
 has


been
 so
 nice
 because
 if
 you
 had
 looked


at
 my
 behavior
 on
 the
 phone
 before
 that,


I
 think
 my
 average
 time
 on
 Instagram


before
 I
 deleted
 it
 was
 like
 42
 minutes


a
 day
 or
 48
 minutes
 a
 day,
 something


like
 that.
 So,
 you
 look
 at
 that
 and


you're
 like,
 well,
 there's
 only
 24
 hours


in
 the
 day.
 This
 is
 getting
 like
 120th


or
 130th
 of
 his
 time.
 Um,
 you
 would
 look


at
 that
 and
 think,
 this
 must
 be
 pretty


important
 to
 him.
 You
 know,
 this
 must
 be


a
 pretty
 important
 part
 of
 his
 life.
 And


in
 fact,
 it
 just
 evaporated
 as
 soon
 as
 I


deleted
 it.
 It
 wasn't
 it
 wasn't
 actually


that
 difficult.
 So,


>> and
 you
 didn't
 miss
 it.


>> No.
 And
 now
 I
 think
 the
 one
 interesting


question
 to
 play
 with
 is
 what
 do
 you
 do


when
 there's
 nothing
 to
 do?


>> So,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 when
 they
 are


standing
 in
 line
 at
 the
 grocery
 store
 or


they're
 waiting
 for
 the
 gas
 to
 fill
 up


in
 the
 car
 or
 something
 like
 that,
 what


do
 they
 do?
 Well,
 they
 pull
 their
 phone


out,
 you
 know.
 Um,
 last
 night
 I
 went
 to


a
 restaurant.
 every
 single
 person
 who


was
 waiting
 in
 line
 for
 a
 table,
 you
 go


in,
 you
 check
 in,
 you
 okay,
 we'll
 seat


you
 in
 five
 minutes.
 Every
 single
 person


pulled
 their
 phone
 out.
 Um,
 and
 so
 what


do
 you
 do
 when
 you
 have
 nothing
 to
 do?


And
 for
 most
 of
 us,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 time


it's
 check
 your
 phone,
 check
 your
 uh,


you
 know,
 check
 social
 media.
 So
 you
 do


need
 something
 to
 fill
 that
 space.
 So


maybe,
 you
 know,
 what
 I
 did
 was
 I
 moved


Audible
 to
 the
 home
 screen
 of
 my
 phone


and
 I
 just
 said,
 well,
 I'll
 just
 listen


to
 an
 audio
 book
 when,
 you
 know,
 when


I'm
 usually
 doing
 that.
 you
 some
 try,


you
 need
 something
 frictionless
 to
 fill


that
 gap.
 Um,
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 it


should
 be
 for
 each
 person,
 but
 I
 think


it's
 it's
 good
 to
 have
 a
 qu
 an
 answer
 to


that
 question
 because
 otherwise
 you're


going
 to
 have
 to
 just
 sit
 with,
 you


know,
 there's
 nothing
 to
 do.


>> And
 what
 are
 your
 strategies
 on
 a


desktop
 instead
 of
 a
 phone?


>> Desktop,
 I'm
 okay
 with
 having
 social


media.
 Um,
 I
 actually
 stay
 logged
 in
 on


most
 of
 uh
 the
 social
 media
 accounts


except
 for
 uh
 Twitter
 actually.
 I
 just
 I


can't
 I'll
 I'll
 spend
 too
 much
 time
 on


it.
 So,
 I
 forced
 myself
 to
 be
 logged


out.
 Um,
 I
 also
 have
 tried
 to
 install
 um


some
 additional
 barriers,
 which
 is
 I


can't
 log
 in
 to
 any
 of
 my
 social


accounts
 on
 my
 own.
 I
 have
 to
 text
 my


assistant
 to
 send
 me
 the
 login
 because


it's
 tied
 to
 a
 separate
 phone.
 Um,
 it's


I
 can't
 even
 get
 past
 the
 two-factor
 um


because
 it
 doesn't
 go
 to
 my
 phone


anymore.
 So,
 there's
 just
 uh
 yeah,
 it's


just
 me
 trying
 to
 like
 moderate
 my
 own


behavior.


>> I
 love
 it.
 what
 upstream
 habits
 are
 most


important
 for
 people
 to
 think
 about
 or


create


>> that.
 So
 the
 I
 I
 didn't
 mention
 this


earlier
 but
 I
 think
 this
 is
 also
 related


to
 sequencing
 which
 is
 just
 asking
 you


know
 what
 things
 are
 upstream
 from
 the


outcomes
 that
 I
 want
 or
 from
 the
 habits


that
 I
 want.
 It's
 a
 good
 it's
 a
 good
 way


to
 a
 good
 frame
 for
 thinking
 about
 what


you
 should
 focus
 on.
 You
 should


generally
 try
 to
 do
 the
 things
 that
 are


upstream
 first.
 Um


probably
 the
 single
 most
 important
 habit


that
 is
 upstream
 of
 all
 the
 other
 ones


is
 some
 kind
 of
 habit
 of
 reflection


review.
 The
 habit
 of
 thinking
 um
 it
 is


so
 unlikely
 that
 um
 whatever
 you
 are


working
 on
 now
 is
 the
 best
 use
 of
 your


time
 is
 it's
 almost
 impossible.
 And
 so
 I


think
 Sam
 Alman
 has
 some
 line
 where
 he


says
 you
 should
 have
 a
 very
 high
 bar
 for


working
 on
 anything
 other
 than
 thinking


about
 what
 to
 work
 on.
 Um
 because
 that's


that's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 biggest
 point
 of


leverage
 is
 choosing
 a
 better
 thing
 to


focus
 your
 attention
 on.


>> And
 so
 many
 people
 are,
 you
 know,
 I
 I


was
 like
 this
 too.
 If
 you
 have
 if
 you're


the
 type
 of
 person
 who
 has
 a
 very
 good


work
 ethic
 and
 hard
 work
 has
 benefited


you
 a
 lot
 in
 your
 life,
 you
 get
 to
 a


point
 where
 you
 start
 to
 use
 it
 as
 a


crutch
 because
 you're
 like,
 well,
 I'll


just
 work
 my
 way
 out
 of
 it.
 You
 know,


I'll
 just
 I'll
 just
 work
 harder
 and


that's
 a
 way
 to
 solve
 this
 problem.
 But


you
 cannot
 outwork
 the
 person
 who's


working
 on
 a
 better
 thing.
 And
 so
 um
 it


is
 possible
 if
 you
 really
 grind
 maybe


you
 can
 work
 10%
 harder
 or
 20%
 harder


than
 you
 are
 now.
 But
 if
 you
 work
 on
 the


right
 thing
 you
 get
 100x
 of
 the
 results


or
 thousandx
 the
 results.
 And
 so
 what


you
 need
 I
 I
 almost
 feel
 like
 we
 should


change
 the
 definition
 of
 what
 it
 means


to
 work
 hard.
 It
 should
 not
 only
 mean


putting
 in
 the
 hours.
 It
 should
 also


mean
 outthinking
 the
 other
 person.
 If


you're
 not
 outthinking
 them,
 you're
 not


outworking
 them.
 And
 so,
 um,
 a
 habit
 of


reflection
 review
 is
 probably
 the
 single


most
 important
 habit.
 You
 need
 to
 create


some
 time
 in
 your
 week
 to
 sit
 down
 and


think,
 am
 I
 spending
 my
 precious
 time


and
 energy,
 my
 one
 precious
 life
 on
 the


things
 that
 I
 want
 to
 be
 spending
 it
 on?


And
 I
 don't
 know
 any
 other
 way
 to
 do


that
 than
 to
 make
 some
 space
 to
 think.


you
 know,
 if
 you
 just
 keep
 your
 head


down
 and
 work
 hard,
 it's
 just
 really


unlikely
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 be


spending
 it
 in
 the
 right
 way.
 So,
 I
 have


a
 couple
 different
 ways
 I
 do
 it.
 Um,
 I


do
 a
 weekly
 review
 every
 Friday
 where
 I


sit
 down
 that's
 mostly
 related
 to


business
 stuff.
 So,
 you
 know,
 it's


looking
 at
 metrics
 and
 how
 things
 are


going
 and,
 you
 know,
 subscribers
 and


revenue
 and
 expenses
 and
 all
 that
 stuff.


It's
 just
 a
 quick
 check-in.
 Most
 weeks,


nothing
 happens.
 I
 just
 look
 at
 stuff


and
 it's
 fine.
 But
 occasionally
 you'll


get
 a
 week
 where
 you
 see
 a
 trend
 and


it's
 like,
 "Oh,
 that's
 been
 going
 down


for
 3
 weeks
 straight,
 like
 what's
 going


on
 there?"
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 So,


it's
 just
 a
 way
 to
 kind
 of
 notice
 red


flags
 when
 they
 come
 up.
 Um,
 the
 more


important
 one
 is
 I
 do
 an
 annual
 review


and
 the
 annual
 review
 is
 more
 about


values.
 It's
 more
 about
 what
 do
 I
 say
 is


important
 to
 me?
 Who
 am
 I
 the
 type
 of


person
 or
 you
 know,
 who
 am
 I
 trying
 to


be
 as
 a
 person?
 and
 then
 looking
 at
 how


I
 spent
 my
 last
 year
 and
 saying,"Well,


did
 that
 match
 up
 or
 not?"
 My
 calendar


plays
 a
 really
 critical
 role
 there.
 I
 go


through
 my
 calendar
 in
 detail.
 I
 look
 at


how
 many
 workouts
 did
 I
 do
 last
 year,


how
 many
 did
 I
 do
 each
 month,
 what
 was


my
 average
 per
 month?
 I
 look
 at
 how
 many


places
 did
 I
 travel
 to,
 how
 many
 nights


did
 I
 spend
 away
 from
 home,
 is
 that


enough
 or
 not
 enough,
 like
 how
 did
 that


feel?
 Um,
 I
 look
 at
 how
 many
 articles
 I


published
 or
 newsletters
 I
 published,


you
 know,
 things
 like
 that.
 And
 so
 it's


kind
 of
 the
 chance
 for
 me
 to
 check
 in
 on


my
 production
 and
 time
 for
 the
 last


year.
 And
 then
 you
 look
 at
 your
 values


and
 you
 say,
 "Well,
 you
 said
 this
 was


important
 to
 you.
 Is
 that
 actually
 where


you
 spent
 your
 time?"
 And
 so
 it's
 a
 way


to
 course
 correct.
 Um,
 the
 last
 two


years
 it's
 been
 kind
 of
 interesting


because
 I
 I
 usually
 do
 that
 annual


review
 in
 December
 and
 I
 have
 continued


to
 keep
 the
 document
 open
 all
 year
 long


and
 I
 keep
 coming
 back
 to
 it
 and
 trying


to
 write
 like
 new
 principles
 at
 the
 top


of
 it
 or
 whatever
 to
 help
 me
 course


correct.


>> Um,


>> like
 one
 of
 my
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 if
 it


really
 makes
 sense,
 but
 one
 of
 my


principles
 for
 the
 last
 year
 was
 like


move
 like
 thunder.
 Um,
 and
 so
 it's
 like


you
 don't
 really
 see
 it,
 but
 then
 all
 of


a
 sudden
 there's
 this
 big
 crash.
 And
 um,


that's
 the
 that's
 kind
 of
 like
 I'm


trying
 to
 do
 fewer
 things
 but
 with
 a


bigger
 impact.
 And
 so
 I
 just
 have
 little


lines
 like
 that
 that
 are
 at
 the
 top
 to


try
 to
 keep
 me
 on
 track
 with,
 you
 know,


what
 I'm
 hoping
 to
 do
 that
 year.


>> Do
 you
 have
 a
 check-in
 with
 your
 wife?


>> Yeah,
 we
 um,
 we
 don't
 have
 like
 a
 formal


check-in.
 I
 don't
 treat
 it
 like
 a


one-on-one
 that
 you
 would
 do
 like
 in
 a


company
 or
 something
 like
 that,
 but
 what


we
 have,
 you
 know,
 like
 a
 board
 meeting.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 don't
 know.
 It
 just
 feel


it
 just
 feels
 like
 too
 structured
 and


weird,
 you
 know.
 Um,
 but
 the
 biggest


thing
 that
 we've
 done
 the
 last
 couple


years
 is
 a
 monthly
 date
 night
 and
 just


making
 sure
 that
 that
 actually
 happens


every
 month,
 which
 we
 have
 for
 like


probably
 I
 don't
 know
 probably,
 you


know,
 24
 to
 30
 straight
 months
 now.
 Um,


has
 been
 huge.
 It's
 the
 one
 time
 what
 we


say
 is
 it's
 the
 one
 time
 that
 we


actually
 talk,
 which
 sounds
 silly


because
 we're
 talking
 all
 the
 time,


right?
 But
 everything
 is
 logistics.
 It's


all
 tasks
 and
 figuring
 out
 what
 to
 do


with
 the
 kids
 and
 you
 know
 it's
 like


there's
 all
 these
 things
 that
 need
 to
 be


done.
 It's
 all
 jobs
 to
 be
 done
 and
 then


um
 you
 go
 out
 for
 a
 couple
 hours
 and


you're
 like
 oh
 now
 we
 it's
 actually
 we


can
 actually
 talk
 you
 know
 so
 I
 think


that
 has
 been
 uh
 that's
 been
 really


valuable.


>> I
 think
 that's
 so
 important.


>> What
 popular
 habits
 do
 you
 think
 are


garbage?


>> H
 the
 only
 one
 that's
 coming
 to
 me
 right


now
 is
 consuming
 the
 news.
 um
 and


browsing
 social
 media.
 Those
 are
 the
 two


that
 I
 just
 feel
 like
 I
 wonder,
 you


know,
 we
 have
 a
 uh
 one
 of
 our


grandparents
 is
 in
 their
 her
 90s
 and
 um


we
 talked
 to
 her
 and
 it's
 kind
 of
 like,


oh
 yeah,
 we
 smoked
 when
 we
 were
 younger,


but
 like
 nobody
 knew,
 you
 know,
 like


they're
 like
 we
 didn't
 realize
 like


everybody
 did
 it.
 It
 wasn't,
 you
 know,


it
 was
 just
 like
 how
 it
 was.
 And
 I


wonder
 like
 when
 I'm
 94,
 like
 what
 am
 I


going
 to
 be
 saying
 where
 it's
 like
 we


were
 all
 on
 social
 media,
 nobody
 knew,


you
 know,
 like
 we
 didn't
 realize.
 And
 I


don't
 mean
 to
 criticize
 social
 media
 too


much
 because
 like
 obviously
 there
 are


benefits
 from
 it.
 But
 um
 I
 do
 I
 do


wonder
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 look
 back
 on


and
 be
 like
 yeah
 we
 didn't
 quite
 realize


the
 full
 effect
 of
 all
 of
 it.
 Um
 and
 it


was
 kind
 of
 like
 you
 know
 messing
 with


our
 minds.
 So
 increasingly,
 I
 mean,


we're
 moving
 to
 a
 world,
 I
 don't
 think


people
 quite
 realize
 it
 yet,
 where
 if


you
 and
 I
 open
 the
 same
 article
 in
 the


Wall
 Street
 Journal
 or
 New
 York
 Times,


it's
 going
 to
 be
 two
 different
 versions


of
 that
 article
 that's
 based
 on
 our


browsing
 history,
 our
 political


preferences.
 And
 I'm
 not
 saying
 they're


doing
 that
 today,
 but
 you
 can
 see
 the


technology
 is
 sort
 of
 formulated.


>> I
 kind
 of
 feel
 like
 the
 only
 way
 to
 win


is
 to
 not
 play
 the
 game,


>> you
 know?
 So
 that
 that's
 why
 I've
 sort


of
 checked
 out
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 ways.
 Um,
 we


have
 two
 friends
 who
 are
 our
 age
 who


have
 never
 had
 social
 media
 accounts
 and


I'm
 like,
 man,
 I
 kind
 of
 wonder
 what


it's
 like
 sometimes.
 Like
 that's
 kind
 of


I
 I
 I
 don't
 necessarily
 like
 envy
 them,


but
 I
 do
 look
 at
 that
 and
 I'm
 like,


that's
 kind
 of
 a
 refreshing
 way
 to
 live,


you
 know?


>> And
 it
 is
 interesting
 how
 uh
 essential


it
 feels
 in
 the
 moment.
 It
 feels
 like,


oh,
 I
 can't
 really
 give
 this
 up
 because


this
 is
 a
 really
 big
 important
 part
 of


my
 life.
 But
 if
 you
 can
 get
 yourself
 to


give
 it
 up
 for
 a
 month
 or
 something,
 you


realize
 actually
 life
 goes
 on
 just
 fine.


Um
 there's
 you
 can
 still
 live
 a
 very


rich
 and
 full
 and
 fulfilling
 life
 and
 it


plays
 no
 no
 role
 in
 it.
 So
 um
 yeah,


giving
 I
 think
 giving
 that
 up
 has
 been


has
 been
 good.


>> What's
 the
 two-minute
 rule?


>> Two-minute
 rule
 is
 very
 simple.
 It
 just


says
 take
 whatever
 habit
 you're
 trying


to
 focus
 on
 and
 scale
 it
 down
 to


something
 that
 takes
 2
 minutes
 or
 less


to
 do.
 So
 read
 30
 books
 a
 year
 becomes


read
 one
 page
 or
 do
 yoga
 4
 days
 a
 week


becomes
 take
 out
 my
 yoga
 mat.
 You
 know


sometimes
 I
 mention
 those
 examples
 to


people
 and
 they
 kind
 of
 resist
 it
 a


little
 bit.
 You
 know
 one
 guy
 who's
 like


okay
 buddy.
 You
 know
 like
 I
 know
 the


real
 goal
 isn't
 just
 to
 take
 my
 yoga
 mat


out.
 You
 know
 I'm
 actually
 trying
 to
 do


the
 workout.
 So
 I
 understand
 where


people
 are
 coming
 from.
 But
 the


two-minute
 rule
 does
 something


important.
 You
 know
 I
 have
 this
 reader.


His
 name
 was
 Mitch.
 I
 mentioned
 him
 in


Ato
 atomic
 habits
 and
 he
 started
 going


to
 the
 gym
 and
 he
 lost
 over
 100
 pounds.


He's
 kept
 off
 for
 more
 than
 a
 decade


now.
 But
 when
 he
 first
 started
 to
 go,
 he


had
 a
 rule
 where
 he
 wasn't
 allowed
 to


stay
 at
 the
 gym
 for
 longer
 than
 5


minutes.
 So
 he
 get
 in
 the
 car,
 drive
 to


the
 gym,
 get
 out,
 do
 half
 an
 exercise,


get
 back
 in
 the
 car,
 drive
 home.
 And
 it


sounds
 silly,
 right?
 It
 sounds
 like
 kind


of
 ridiculous,
 like,
 oh,
 clearly
 this
 is


not
 going
 to
 get
 the
 guy
 the
 results
 he


wants.


>> But
 what
 you
 realize
 is
 he
 was
 mastering


the
 art
 of
 showing
 up.
 you
 know,
 he
 was


becoming
 the
 type
 of
 person
 that
 went
 to


the
 gym
 four
 days
 a
 week,
 even
 if
 it
 was


only
 for
 5
 minutes.
 And
 I
 think
 this
 is


a
 very
 deep
 truth
 about
 habits,
 which
 is


a
 habit
 must
 be
 established
 before
 it


can
 be
 improved.
 You
 know,
 it
 has
 to


become
 the
 standard
 in
 your
 life
 before


you
 can
 scale
 it
 up
 and
 optimize
 and


turning
 it
 into
 something
 more.
 You
 need


to
 standardize
 before
 you
 optimize.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 the
 two-minute
 rule
 helps
 you
 do


that.
 It
 helps
 push
 back
 on
 that


perfectionist
 tendency,
 that
 feeling


that
 you
 need
 to
 have
 it
 all
 figured
 out


or
 to
 do
 it
 perfectly
 to
 do
 it
 at
 all.
 I


don't
 know
 why
 we
 do
 that
 with
 our


habits.
 We
 get
 very
 all
 or
 nothing
 about


them.
 You
 know,
 we're
 so
 focused
 on


finding
 the
 best
 sales
 strategy,
 the


perfect
 business
 idea,
 the
 ideal
 diet


plan.
 We're
 so
 focused
 on
 optimizing


that
 if
 we
 can't
 find
 the
 perfect
 one,


we're
 like,
 well,
 I
 need
 to
 keep


researching.
 But
 you
 need
 to
 master
 the


art
 of
 showing
 up.
 You
 know,
 like
 if
 you


can't
 go
 to
 the
 gym
 for
 five
 minutes


four
 days
 a
 week,
 who
 cares
 how
 good
 the


45minute
 workout
 plan
 is?
 You
 know,
 it's


just
 a
 theory
 at
 that
 point.
 Ed
 Latimore


has
 that
 phrase
 or
 that
 quote
 where
 he


says
 the
 heaviest
 weight
 at
 the
 gym
 is


the
 front
 door.


>> Yeah.


>> Like
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of things
 in
 life


that
 are
 like
 that.
 You
 know,
 the


hardest
 step
 is
 the
 first
 one.
 The
 most


difficult
 action
 is
 the
 first
 movement.


So,
 you
 need
 to
 master
 the
 first
 step,


master
 stage
 one,
 and
 then
 advance.
 I
 I


just
 like
 this
 principle
 of
 you
 should


try
 to
 use
 your
 current
 advantages
 to


gain
 new
 advantages.
 So,
 you
 know,
 early


on,
 like
 if
 I
 look
 at
 my
 entrepreneurial


career,
 um,
 early
 on,
 I
 had
 very
 few


advantages.
 You
 know,
 I
 had
 no
 money,
 no


resources,
 no
 connections.
 But
 what
 did


I
 have?
 I
 had
 time.
 And
 so,
 for
 the


first
 three
 years,
 I
 wrote
 a
 new
 article


every
 Monday
 and
 Thursday.
 And
 I
 would


spend
 on
 average,
 I
 would
 spend
 between


like
 15
 and
 20
 hours
 on
 each
 article.


The
 short
 the
 fastest
 I
 ever
 did
 one
 was


eight
 hours.
 Um,
 the
 longest
 was
 like
 40


something,
 but
 that
 was
 rare.
 Um,
 but


you
 know,
 if
 you
 if
 you
 spend
 20
 hours


on
 two
 articles
 a
 week,
 that's
 40-hour


week
 right
 there.
 And
 most
 people
 are


not
 spending
 that
 much
 time
 on
 a


2,000word
 article.
 And
 so
 my
 mission
 was


just
 to
 try
 to
 make
 it
 the
 most
 useful,


valuable,
 actionable
 article
 it
 could


be.
 And
 if
 you
 do
 that
 a
 hundred
 times,


you
 end
 up
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 really
 good


content
 on
 there.
 And
 that
 helped
 the


audience
 grow.
 So
 then
 I
 then
 I
 used
 my


current
 advantage,
 which
 was
 time
 to


create
 something
 of
 value.
 That
 helped


grow
 the
 audience.
 Now
 I
 have
 100,000


email
 subscribers.
 Now
 I
 have
 a
 new


advantage
 um
 which
 is
 I
 have
 an


audience.
 And
 so
 then
 that
 kept
 growing.


I
 think
 once
 I
 got
 to
 around
 200
 is
 when


I
 got
 the
 book
 deal
 for
 Atomic
 Habits.


So
 you
 use
 your
 new
 advantage
 to
 gain


another
 one.
 Now
 I
 have
 a
 book
 deal
 um


and
 spent
 the
 next
 three
 years
 writing


the
 book.
 Um
 then
 you
 have
 a
 bestselling


book.
 That's
 another
 advantage.
 And
 you


can
 just,
 you
 know,
 you
 see
 how
 you
 try


to
 like
 lever
 up
 um
 one
 after
 the
 other


and
 you
 start
 to
 accumulate
 these
 these


new
 advantages
 and
 it
 puts
 you
 in
 a
 much


different
 position.
 Um
 now


there's
 obviously
 some
 patience
 that


needs
 to
 come
 with
 that,
 right?
 Like
 I


just
 described
 something
 in
 30
 seconds


that
 took
 like
 seven
 years,
 you
 know?
 Um


so
 it
 takes
 a
 while.
 But
 sometimes
 uh


people
 will
 say,
 "Oh,
 how
 did
 Atomic


Habits
 become
 this
 bestseller
 or


whatever?"
 And
 really
 what
 you're
 seeing


when
 the
 book
 comes
 out
 is
 the
 release


of
 potential
 energy
 that
 was
 built
 over


like
 five
 years
 prior.
 You
 know,
 it's


not
 like
 it
 happened
 overnight.
 It
 was


the
 five
 years
 of
 building
 an
 audience


of
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 people,


meeting
 other
 authors,
 going
 on
 podcasts


and
 doing
 interviews.
 You
 know,
 all
 that


stuff
 was
 released
 around
 the
 same
 time,


but
 it
 was
 it
 took
 a
 while
 for
 it
 to
 get


built
 up.
 So
 anyway,
 that's
 just
 another


one
 of
 my
 little
 principles,
 which
 is


use
 your
 current
 advantages
 to
 gain
 new


advantages.


One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 prevents
 people


from
 doing
 things
 is
 they
 just
 don't


feel
 like
 it.
 How
 do
 we
 become
 stronger


than
 our
 feelings?
 I
 think
 it's
 okay
 if


you
 don't
 feel
 like
 it.
 Um
 I
 think


sometimes
 it's
 a
 signal,
 you
 know,
 like


you
 should
 procrastination
 is
 not
 always


a
 bad
 thing.
 If
 you're
 procrastinating


on
 something,
 something
 sometimes
 it's
 a


signal
 that
 you
 don't
 actually
 want
 that


thing.
 Uh
 which
 is
 fine.
 I
 for
 a
 long


time
 I
 so
 I
 I
 was
 good
 in
 school.
 I
 got


good
 grades.
 It
 was
 like
 a
 game
 for
 me


that
 I
 tried
 to
 win.
 You
 know,
 I
 didn't


really
 care
 about
 whether
 I
 was


learning.
 I
 cared
 about
 was
 I
 getting


A's,
 you
 know,
 am
 I
 am
 I
 succeeding?
 Um,


which
 may
 not
 be
 the
 way
 that
 you
 want


to
 go
 through
 school,
 but
 that's,
 you


know,
 that's
 how
 I
 treated
 it
 at
 the


time.
 And,
 um,
 so
 for
 a
 long
 time,
 if


you
 asked
 me
 when
 I
 was
 in
 college,
 what


are
 you
 going
 to
 do?
 I
 said
 I
 was
 going


to
 go
 to
 medical
 school.
 Um,
 it
 was


something
 that
 I
 I
 liked.
 I
 do
 think
 I


would
 like
 a
 lot
 about
 being
 a
 doctor
 or


a
 surgeon.
 There's
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot


about
 that
 profession
 that
 would
 I
 would


align
 with
 who
 I
 am.
 But
 there's
 also


probably
 30%
 or
 40%
 that
 would
 not
 have


been
 a
 good
 fit
 for
 me.
 And
 um
 I
 kept


saying
 that
 because
 it's
 the
 type
 of


thing
 that
 you
 can
 say
 and
 never
 be


criticized
 for.
 You
 know,
 like
 you
 go


home
 at
 Thanksgiving
 or
 Christmas
 and


people
 are
 like,
 "What
 are
 you
 going to


do?"
 And
 you're
 like, "I'm
 going to
 go


to
 medical
 school."
 And
 everybody
 says,


"That's
 great."
 You
 know,
 um
 and
 you


know,
 some
 people
 should
 be
 doctors,
 but


what
 I
 kept
 procrastinating
 on
 was


studying
 for
 the
 MCAT.
 the
 entrance
 exam


and
 that
 was
 kind
 of
 a
 sign,
 you
 know,


it
 was
 it
 was
 a
 sign
 that
 I
 didn't


really
 want
 to
 do
 this
 because
 I
 wasn't


fully
 in.
 Um,
 and
 I
 ignored
 that
 for
 a


long
 time.
 Um,
 and
 took
 it
 and
 didn't
 do


that
 well
 and
 you
 know,
 but
 it's
 like


yeah,
 like
 this
 wasn't
 that
 wasn't


necessarily
 a
 bad
 thing.
 It
 was
 a
 sign


that
 I
 realized
 at
 some
 intuitive
 level


that
 this
 isn't
 actually
 what
 I
 wanted


and
 it
 was
 just
 a
 story
 that
 I
 kept


saying.
 Um
 whereas
 other
 stuff
 like


writing
 about
 habits
 for
 example
 I
 I
 was


interning
 at
 an
 orthopedic
 medical


practice
 over
 the
 summer
 and
 I
 got
 to
 do


a
 lot
 of
 cool
 stuff.
 I
 went
 in
 on
 like


35
 surgeries
 and
 got
 to
 like
 shadow
 that


and
 watch
 it.
 That
 was
 really
 neat.
 I


did
 some
 back-end
 billing
 stuff
 for
 the


practice.
 But
 each
 afternoon
 I
 usually


ended
 up
 with
 about
 two
 hours
 where
 I


was
 supposed
 to
 be
 working
 till
 5:00
 and


I
 didn't
 have
 anything
 to
 do.
 And
 so
 I


sat
 down
 and
 I
 started
 writing
 about


habits.
 I
 just
 had
 this
 word
 doc.
 It
 was


just
 kind
 of
 like
 James'
 thoughts
 on


habits
 and
 it
 got
 to
 be
 about
 60
 pages


long
 and
 I
 was
 like
 you
 should
 publish


something
 of
 this
 you
 know
 this
 is
 kind


of
 ridiculous
 keep
 writing
 about
 all


this
 like
 what
 are
 you
 going to
 do
 it


for
 kind
 of
 back
 to
 my
 earlier
 point


about
 you
 should
 share
 your
 work


publicly
 and
 nobody
 asked
 me
 to
 do
 that


you
 know
 um
 but
 I
 so
 it's
 kind
 of
 like


what
 are
 you
 what
 are
 you
 doing
 on


nights
 and
 weekends
 what
 are
 you
 doing


with
 your
 free
 time
 maybe
 that's
 what


you
 should
 be
 doing
 during
 the
 week


>> and
 it
 was
 like
 very
 much
 that
 sort
 of


energy
 and
 So
 you
 look
 at
 medical
 school


and
 you're
 like,
 well,
 I
 was


procrastinating
 on
 a
 key
 part
 of
 it.
 And


then
 you
 look
 at
 the
 habits
 and
 like


writing
 part
 and
 you're
 like,
 well,
 you


were
 doing
 this
 and
 nobody
 was
 even


asking
 you
 to.
 Um,
 and
 so
 those
 are
 two


very
 different
 forms
 of
 energy.
 And
 I


think
 trying
 to
 find
 the
 things
 where


you
 are
 uh
 running
 toward
 the
 next


thing,
 not
 away
 from
 the
 last
 thing.


Like
 same
 same
 direction,
 totally


different
 energy.
 What
 are
 you
 naturally


running
 toward?
 What
 is
 naturally


pulling
 you
 in?
 And
 those
 are
 the
 places


that
 you
 should
 double
 down
 on.
 One
 of


the
 things
 that
 you
 said
 that
 stood
 out


to
 me
 there
 was
 nobody
 could
 argue
 with


the
 fact
 that
 I
 was
 I
 was
 pursuing
 this


goal
 and
 so
 many
 people
 seem
 to
 optimize


their
 life
 in
 in
 this
 way,
 right?
 Where


I'm
 not
 standing
 out.
 I'm
 not
 spiky.
 I'm


nobody
 can


>> what
 will
 you
 not
 be
 criticized
 for?
 How


do
 we
 develop
 the
 courage
 to
 I
 mean
 the


the
 book
 the
 courage
 to
 be
 disliked
 but


basically
 the
 courage
 to


um
 yeah
 it's
 kind
 of
 the
 I
 have
 started


to
 call
 it
 internally
 to
 myself
 I've


started
 to
 call
 it
 the
 tyranny
 of
 labels


you
 know
 it
 is
 the
 the
 tyranny
 of
 being


beholden
 to
 a
 label
 it's
 the
 need
 to
 be


described
 in
 a
 certain
 way
 to
 need
 to
 be


called
 a
 best-selling
 author
 or
 a


surgeon
 or
 a
 lawyer
 or
 whatever
 the


label
 is.
 If
 you
 need
 that
 label,
 then


you
 are
 beholden
 to
 doing
 it
 that
 way.


>> But
 if
 you
 can
 release
 yourself
 from
 the


label
 and
 instead
 ask
 yourself,
 what


type
 of
 lifestyle
 do
 I
 want
 or
 what
 type


of
 impact
 do
 I
 want
 to
 make
 regardless


of
 what
 the
 actual
 label
 is?
 Now,
 all
 of


a
 sudden,
 a
 ton
 of
 options
 open
 up.
 So,


as
 an
 example,
 like
 I
 have
 a
 couple


friends
 and
 family
 members
 who
 are


professors.
 If
 you
 need
 to
 be
 a


professor,
 if
 you
 need
 to
 have
 that


label,
 you're
 very
 limited
 in
 what
 your


job
 options
 are.
 But
 if
 instead
 you
 ask


yourself,
 well,
 what
 kind
 of
 lifestyle


do
 I
 want?
 Okay,
 well,
 a
 professor's
 off


in
 the
 summer.
 I
 like
 the
 flexibility
 of


that
 lifestyle.
 Or
 what
 type
 of
 impact


do
 I
 want
 to
 make?
 Well,
 professors
 get


to
 teach.
 They
 teach
 concepts
 to
 other


people.
 Well,
 if
 you
 say,
 if
 you
 just


say,
 I
 want
 a
 flexible
 life
 where
 I
 get


to
 teach
 people.
 There
 are
 tons
 of


options.
 You
 could
 be
 a
 podcaster,
 you


could
 be
 a
 YouTuber,
 you
 could
 write,


you
 could
 do,
 you
 know,
 you
 can
 do


almost
 infinite,
 you
 could
 be
 a
 coach.


There's
 so
 many
 different
 ways
 to
 teach


um
 and
 to
 have
 a
 flexible
 life.
 But
 if


it
 needs
 to
 be
 about
 the
 label,
 now
 all


of
 a
 sudden
 your
 subset
 of
 options
 is


very
 limited.
 And
 um
 I
 have
 seen
 this


again
 and
 again
 with
 people
 who
 I
 think


are
 very
 talented
 and
 intelligent
 but


they
 kind
 of
 restrict
 themselves
 because


they
 have
 to
 have
 the
 label.


>> And
 so
 I
 think
 if
 you
 can
 give
 that
 up,


if
 you
 can
 release
 that
 need
 to
 be


described
 in
 a
 certain
 way,
 to
 have
 a


certain
 status
 marker,
 but
 instead
 ask


yourself,
 what
 type
 of
 impact
 do
 I
 want


to
 make?
 What
 type
 of
 lifestyle
 do
 I


want
 to
 have?
 Now
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 you


have
 a
 lot
 more
 options
 for
 making
 it


happen.


>> A
 lot
 of
 people
 consume
 the
 gist
 of


something.
 So
 if
 you
 think
 of
 uh
 James,


you
 know,
 you
 read
 a
 full
 book,
 you


might
 take
 away
 one
 idea
 from
 that
 book,


you
 you
 compress
 that
 idea
 into
 a


thought,
 you
 post
 that
 thought
 on


Twitter.
 Yeah.


>> Somebody
 reads
 that
 thought


>> and
 they
 think
 that
 they
 understand
 at


the
 same
 level
 that
 you
 do,
 but
 you've


distilled
 all
 this
 experience
 into
 that.


How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 when
 it's
 okay
 to


have
 the
 gist
 of
 something
 versus
 when


you
 need
 to
 deep
 dive
 and
 it's
 actually


important
 to
 go
 into
 the
 weeds
 on


things?
 It
 seems
 I
 I'll
 put
 this
 in


context.
 It
 seems
 more
 and
 more
 people


are
 refusing
 to
 deep
 dive
 and
 we're
 just


sort
 of
 like
 skimming
 on
 the
 surface
 of


knowledge.


>> That's
 absolutely
 right.
 Uh
 a
 lot
 of


that
 is
 kind
 of
 a
 is
 it
 the
 medium
 or


the
 me?
 The
 medium
 is
 the
 message
 sort


of
 thing.
 You
 get
 forced
 into
 it
 by
 the


shape
 of
 Twitter
 or
 the
 shape
 of


Instagram
 or
 whatever.
 It's
 not
 it's
 not


a
 place
 where
 you
 can
 unpack
 a


booklength
 argument
 or
 even
 a
 30
 minute


argument.
 You
 know,
 it's
 everything
 is


compressed
 to
 a
 headline
 or
 a
 tweet.
 So,


it's
 hard
 to


it's
 hard
 to
 play
 that
 game
 to
 be


browsing
 on
 there
 for
 30
 minutes
 or
 60


minutes
 or
 an
 hour
 and
 a
 half
 a
 day
 and


uh
 also
 be
 nuanced.
 You
 know,
 you
 need


to
 you
 need
 to
 play
 a
 different
 game
 if


you
 want
 the
 nuance.
 Um
 but
 separately


thinking
 about
 this
 for
 me
 you're
 right


that
 is
 a
 big
 part
 of
 what
 I
 do
 is
 I
 try


to
 so
 I
 I
 when
 I
 was
 working
 on
 Atomic


Habits
 I
 had
 12
 chapters
 at
 the
 time


there
 ended
 up
 being
 20
 but
 at
 the
 time


there
 were
 12
 and
 I
 wrote
 the
 chapter


title
 on
 an
 index
 card
 for
 each
 of
 them.


I
 laid
 all
 12
 out
 on
 the
 floor
 and
 then


I
 went
 to
 my
 bookshelf
 and
 I
 grabbed


each
 book
 that
 was
 relevant
 to
 that


chapter
 and
 usually
 there
 were
 like
 four


or
 five
 or
 six
 for
 each
 chapter.
 So
 I


had
 these
 little
 stacks
 of
 books
 by
 each


index
 card
 and
 then
 I
 looked
 at
 each
 of


those
 books
 and
 I
 said,
 "How
 can
 I
 take


everything
 that
 is
 genuinely
 useful
 from


this
 book?"
 Like
 when
 you
 sit
 down,
 you


read
 these
 200
 pages,
 what
 are
 the
 two


or
 three
 ideas
 that
 you
 actually


remember
 or
 that
 made
 an
 impact
 or
 what


are
 the
 20
 pages
 that
 really
 drove
 that


point
 home?
 Can
 I
 take
 everything
 that's


actually
 useful
 about
 this
 book
 and


compress
 it
 into
 this
 chapter?
 And
 so


that
 if
 you
 read
 this
 one
 chapter
 now,


you
 don't
 have
 to
 read
 those
 six
 books.


And
 I
 actually
 think
 that
 is
 a
 good


measure
 for
 what
 makes
 a
 great


non-fiction
 book
 is
 how
 many
 other
 books


can
 you
 make
 irrelevant
 by
 writing
 this.


Now
 that
 you've
 read
 Atomic
 Habits,
 you


don't
 need
 to
 read
 these
 other
 30.
 Um,


and
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I
 actually
 hit
 that


measure
 or
 not,
 right?
 Like
 that's
 for


the
 readers
 to
 decide.
 But
 you're
 never


going
 to
 hit
 it
 unless
 you
 strive
 for


it.
 And
 so
 that
 was
 part
 of
 the


objective
 was
 to
 take
 everything
 that


was
 useful
 and
 to
 compress
 it
 into
 this


higher
 signal
 um,
 you
 know,
 piece.
 The


first
 draft
 of
 Atomic
 Habits
 was
 like


700
 and


12
 pages
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 Um
 the


final
 one
 was,
 you
 know,
 230
 or


whatever.
 And
 so,
 um,
 it
 got
 compressed


a
 lot
 and
 I
 my
 goal
 was
 for
 it
 to
 be,


um,
 as
 high
 signal
 as
 as
 it
 could


possibly
 be.
 So,


that
 is
 a
 big
 part
 of
 what
 I
 do.
 Um,
 and


you're
 right
 that
 if
 you
 just
 read
 the


compressed
 version,
 you
 don't


necessarily
 have
 the
 same
 nuance
 or


depth
 that
 somebody
 else
 has.
 It's


tricky
 to
 figure
 out
 like
 when
 do
 you


need
 that
 and
 when
 can
 you
 just
 have
 the


the
 short
 version
 because
 like
 I
 said


earlier
 in
 many
 areas
 of
 life
 good


enough
 is
 good
 enough.
 And
 so
 giving


somebody
 the
 compressed
 and
 actionable


version
 is
 enough
 for
 them
 to
 get
 what


they
 want.
 And
 then
 really
 the
 way
 to


honor
 that
 is
 to
 let
 them
 have
 all
 the


rest
 of
 their
 time
 back.
 You
 know
 like


that's
 one
 of
 my
 big
 principles
 is
 that


don't
 waste
 the
 reader's
 time.
 You
 need


to
 have
 an
 extreme
 respect
 for
 the


reader's
 time.
 Almost
 like
 a
 obsession


over
 the
 reader's
 time.
 Every
 word
 that


you
 write
 is
 actually
 an
 obstacle
 that


the
 reader
 does
 not
 want
 to
 have
 to
 go


through.
 Your
 book
 is
 an
 obstacle


between
 them
 and
 the
 result
 that
 they


want.
 And
 so
 every
 word
 needs
 to
 earn


its
 place
 in
 that
 way.
 Um
 and
 if
 you


take
 that
 seriously
 then
 it
 forces
 you


to
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 the
 book
 is
 even


better.
 Um
 but
 certainly
 there
 is
 a
 time


for
 nuance
 and
 depth.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


one
 of
 the
 nice
 things
 about
 um
 books
 is


that
 they
 provide
 that
 space.
 So
 my


strategy
 for
 it
 is
 I
 try
 to
 have
 the


compressed
 version
 which
 is
 like
 the


sound
 bite
 that's
 sticky
 and
 that
 people


can
 remember
 they
 can
 walk
 around
 with


it
 in
 their
 mind.
 So
 things
 from
 atomic


habits
 like
 every
 action
 you
 take
 is
 a


vote
 for
 the
 type
 of
 person
 you
 wish
 to


become.
 Great.
 That's
 kind
 of
 sticky.


You
 can
 remember
 that
 as
 you
 go


throughout
 your
 day
 whether
 you're


working
 on
 a
 fitness
 habit
 or
 a


parenting
 habit
 or
 a
 writing
 habit.
 you


know,
 you
 can
 be
 like,
 "Okay,
 I'm
 trying


to
 cast
 a
 vote
 for
 who
 I
 am."
 It's
 like


a
 little
 shortorthhand
 that
 you
 can
 take


with
 you,
 but
 then
 the
 whole
 chapter
 is


20
 pages.
 You
 know,
 we're
 unpacking
 why


identity
 is
 powerful
 and
 how
 habits
 and


identity
 intertwine
 with
 each
 other
 and


why
 that's
 useful
 in
 some
 of
 the


research
 and
 so
 on.
 So,
 the
 book
 gives


you
 the
 space
 to
 make
 the
 argument,
 but


the
 sound
 bite
 gives
 you
 something


sticky
 that
 you
 can
 walk
 around
 with,


you
 know,
 or
 like
 you
 don't
 rise
 to
 the


level
 of
 your
 goals,
 you
 fall
 to
 the


level
 of
 your
 systems.
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 of


people
 like
 that
 phrase
 or,
 you
 know,
 a


lot
 of
 companies
 or
 teams
 have
 used
 get


1%
 better
 every
 day.
 It's
 so
 it's
 good


to
 have
 the
 compressed
 versions
 because


they
 it's
 nice
 to
 have
 that


shortorthhand
 as
 you
 go
 through
 your
 day


to
 keep
 you
 on
 track,
 but
 the
 book
 gives


the
 real
 estate
 to
 unpack
 the
 full


argument.


>> Why
 do
 you
 think
 that
 we
 focus
 on


complexity
 when
 simplicity
 usually


carries
 most
 of
 the
 outcome?


>> We
 have
 a
 very
 strong
 desire
 to
 believe


that
 there's
 a
 secret.
 You
 know,
 people


people
 want
 to
 know
 what
 the
 secrets


are.
 um
 like
 The
 Athletic
 ran
 this


article
 a
 couple
 years
 ago
 about
 um


Michael
 Phelps
 and
 his
 breathing


techniques
 and
 it
 was
 one
 of
 the
 most


popular
 articles
 that
 you
 know
 they
 had


and
 people
 people
 want
 to
 believe
 oh


there's
 a
 secret
 that
 he's
 doing
 that


I'm
 not
 doing
 and
 if
 I
 knew
 what
 that


was
 then
 you
 know
 it
 would
 make
 the


difference
 and
 I'm
 not
 saying
 that
 they


don't
 make
 a
 difference
 they
 probably


did
 help
 him
 but
 also
 you
 know
 he's
 6'6


and
 built
 like
 a
 fish
 and
 you
 know
 like


he's
 perfectly
 designed
 for
 this,
 you


know,
 for
 this
 outcome.
 Um,
 and
 so,
 uh,


yeah,
 was
 it
 the
 breathing
 techniques
 or


was
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 like
 didn't
 miss
 a


swim
 for
 like,
 you
 know,
 16
 straight


years?
 He's
 in
 the
 pool,
 like,
 you
 know,


there's
 there's
 so
 many
 other
 pieces
 of


it.
 Um,
 so
 we
 want
 to
 believe
 that


there's
 some
 secret
 behind
 it,
 but
 a
 lot


of
 it
 is
 like
 I
 sometimes
 when
 people


will
 come
 to
 me
 and
 ask
 about
 building


an
 audience
 or
 um,
 you
 know,
 launching
 a


newsletter
 or
 writing
 a
 book,
 getting
 in


shape
 even,
 a
 lot
 a
 lot
 of
 habits
 are


like
 this.
 Um,
 I'll
 say
 like,
 well,
 you


know,
 don't
 miss
 a
 workout
 for
 two
 years


and
 then
 get
 back
 to
 me,
 you
 know,
 like


go
 write
 write
 two
 articles
 a
 week
 for


two
 years
 and
 then
 get
 back
 to
 me,
 you


know,
 like
 have
 you
 done
 the
 simple


version
 yet?
 You
 know,
 like
 have
 you


done
 the
 very
 go
 from
 99.8
 to
 99.9,
 but


they're
 they're
 actually
 at
 45.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Um,
 you
 need
 to
 I
 I
 guess


the
 one
 way
 to
 think
 about
 it
 is,


especially
 in
 the
 beginning,
 the
 primary


bottleneck
 to
 results
 are
 are
 you
 doing


the
 obvious
 things?
 You
 know,
 do
 do
 the


obvious
 stuff
 first.
 There's
 probably


only
 two
 or
 three
 pieces
 that
 you
 just


need
 to
 do
 like
 are
 you
 showing
 up


consistently?
 are
 you
 do?
 You
 know,
 just


do
 the
 obvious
 things
 and
 that
 will
 get


you
 80%
 of
 the
 way
 there.
 And
 then
 once


you're
 there,
 now
 you're
 in
 the
 arena.


Now
 you're
 showing
 up
 each
 day.
 You've


got
 plenty
 to
 optimize.
 But
 by
 trying
 to


make
 it
 too
 complicated
 at
 the
 start,


you
 have
 kind
 of
 like
 shortcut
 yourself


or
 shortcircuited
 it.
 Um
 and
 you've
 also


put
 yourself
 in
 a
 um
 you've
 put
 yourself


in
 a
 worse
 position
 because
 now
 you're


focused
 on
 the
 wrong
 things
 and
 you're


not
 doing
 the
 things
 that
 are
 going
 to


get
 you
 the
 majority
 of
 the
 result.
 So
 u


master
 the
 basics
 to
 start
 and
 then


advance
 from
 there.


>> Somewhat
 related
 to
 that
 and
 actually


related
 to
 the
 investing
 conversation


we're
 having
 is
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about


the
 relationship
 between
 outcome
 and


ego?
 So
 our
 ego
 wants
 us
 to
 be
 the


investor
 that
 beats
 the
 market
 but
 the


actual
 outcome
 we
 want
 is
 maybe
 if
 the


outcome
 is
 beating
 the
 market
 over
 a


long
 period
 of
 time
 and
 we
 could
 do
 that


in
 a
 way
 but
 there's
 no
 ego
 in
 buying


Vanguard.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 some
 sometimes
 I
 think
 we
 we


think
 the
 outcome
 we
 want
 is
 one
 thing,


but
 actually
 the
 outcome
 we
 want
 is
 the


ego
 to
 be
 stroked.
 You
 know,
 it's
 like
 I


wonder
 if
 like
 how
 many
 people
 would
 be


VCs
 if
 you
 weren't
 allowed
 to
 tell


people
 what
 you
 invested
 in.


>> Oh
 yeah.


>> Like
 if
 you
 couldn't
 tell
 people
 I
 was


an
 early
 investor
 in
 Uber,
 you
 know,
 if


you
 couldn't
 tell
 them
 I,
 you
 know,
 I


invested
 in
 Facebook,
 would
 you
 still
 do


it
 or
 you
 like
 how
 much
 of
 it
 how
 much


of
 it
 is
 that
 label
 um
 that
 you
 like?
 So


certainly
 some
 of
 it
 is
 the
 returns,
 but


a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 the
 social
 status
 and
 the


praise.
 So
 there's
 and
 that's
 fine.
 I'm


not
 necessarily
 criticizing
 that.
 Like


we
 are
 social
 creatures,
 you
 know,
 we


are
 primates
 that
 want
 to
 climb
 the


social
 hierarchy.
 Like
 there's
 nothing


there's
 nothing
 odd
 about
 it.
 It's
 part


of
 human
 nature.
 But
 um
 I
 think
 we


should
 at least
 admit
 it,
 you
 know,


admit
 admit
 what's
 what's
 actually
 going


on.
 Um
 we
 crave
 the
 the
 status
 as
 much


as
 we
 crave
 the
 outcome.
 So,
 but
 back
 to


your
 point
 about
 trying
 to
 balance
 ego


and
 outcome
 and
 figuring
 out
 how
 to
 like


walk
 that
 delicate
 dance
 between
 the
 two


and
 not
 let
 your
 ego
 lead
 you
 astray.


Some
 of
 the
 little
 phrases
 I
 try
 to


remind
 myself
 of
 are
 like


I
 I've
 been
 saying
 this
 a
 lot
 recently


with
 one
 of
 the
 projects
 I'm
 working
 on.


I'll
 sit
 down
 to
 with
 the
 team
 and
 I'll


tell
 them
 I
 don't
 need
 to
 be
 right.
 I


just
 want
 us
 to
 get
 it
 right.
 Okay.
 So,


it
 does
 I'm
 going
 to
 generate
 a
 lot
 of


ideas
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 share
 my
 thoughts


on
 it
 but
 I
 don't
 need
 us
 to
 pick
 my


idea.
 that
 is
 not
 the
 goal
 is
 not
 for
 we


us
 to
 do
 what
 James
 says
 the
 goal
 is
 for


us
 to
 get
 it
 right
 so
 what
 do
 we
 need
 to


do
 you
 know
 to
 get
 there
 and
 then


another
 follow-up
 question
 that
 I
 will


often
 ask
 I
 I
 find
 it
 helpful
 for
 me
 to


keep
 asking
 this
 question
 if
 I
 only
 ask


it
 in
 one
 meeting
 it
 doesn't
 do
 it
 but


if
 I
 ask
 it
 again
 and
 again
 it's
 what
 is


not
 being
 said
 right
 now
 that
 needs
 to


be
 said


>> you
 know
 like
 what
 there's
 so
 many
 times


when
 people
 you
 know
 I
 look
 at
 them
 I


say
 what
 are
 you
 thinking
 right
 now
 that


in
 two
 years
 because
 I'm
 a
 slow
 learner


and
 I
 don't
 know
 yet,
 but
 I'll
 figure
 it


out.
 And
 then
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 like,


James
 isn't
 going
 to
 like
 that
 in
 two


years,
 you
 know,
 but
 you
 can
 see
 it


right
 now.
 I
 just
 don't
 I'm
 just
 not


smart
 enough
 to
 ask
 about
 it
 yet.
 So,


what
 needs
 to
 be
 said
 that
 isn't
 being


said.
 Um,
 and
 I
 find
 that
 that
 question


helps.


But
 doing
 both
 of
 those
 things,
 saying
 I


don't
 need
 to
 be
 right.
 I
 just
 want
 us


to
 get
 it
 right.
 And
 then,
 what
 needs
 to


be
 said
 right
 now
 that's
 not
 being
 said,


it
 sets
 the
 table
 so
 that
 people
 can,


you
 know,
 open
 up
 and
 share
 what
 they


need
 to
 share.
 Um,
 so
 I
 come
 back
 to


those
 two
 a
 lot.
 The
 other
 one
 that
 I


come
 back
 to
 is
 telling
 myself,
 this
 is


mostly
 just
 a
 reminder
 for
 myself
 that
 I


am
 not
 right.
 I
 am
 trying
 to
 be
 less


wrong.
 And
 if
 you
 start
 with
 the


position
 that
 I
 am
 already
 wrong,
 I


don't
 know
 everything.
 I'm
 getting


something
 that
 I
 believe
 right
 now
 is


off,
 but
 I'm
 trying
 to
 become
 less


wrong,
 then
 you're
 you're
 more
 in
 a


position
 where
 you're
 trying
 to
 learn


and
 less
 in
 a
 position
 where
 you're


trying
 to
 defend.
 You
 know,
 if
 you


believe
 that
 you're
 right,
 what's
 that


line?
 It's
 like
 the
 fastest
 way
 to
 stop


learning
 something
 is
 to
 believe
 you


already
 know
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 know,
 it's
 like
 if
 you
 already


believe
 that
 you're
 right,
 now
 you're


not
 open
 to
 receiving.
 But
 if
 you


believe
 that
 you're
 wrong
 and
 you're


just
 trying
 to
 improve
 now,
 now
 you
 can


come
 at
 it
 from
 a
 much
 more
 humble
 place


and
 it
 doesn't
 need
 to
 be
 about
 you.
 So


I
 those
 are
 I
 don't
 always
 get
 that


stuff
 right,
 but
 those
 are
 those
 are


things
 that
 I
 try
 to
 center
 myself
 with.


Jeff
 Bezos
 had
 this
 saying
 that
 stuck


with
 me
 ever
 since
 I
 heard
 it,
 which
 was


basically,
 and
 I'm
 paraphrasing,
 that


the
 people
 who
 are
 right
 a
 lot
 change


their
 mind
 a
 lot.


>> And
 they're
 rarely
 right
 at
 the


beginning,
 but
 they're
 right
 at
 the
 end.


And
 there's
 a
 huge
 difference
 between


being
 right
 at
 the
 start
 and
 being
 right


at
 the
 end.


>> Well,
 that's
 great
 because
 it's
 so
 hard


to
 be
 right
 at
 the
 start.
 So
 unlikely


that
 your
 first
 idea
 is
 the
 one
 that


works,
 you
 know,
 or
 the
 one
 that's


correct.
 I
 mean,
 you
 need
 to
 be
 willing


to
 adjust
 along
 the
 way.
 And
 so
 that


that
 level
 of
 flexibility
 is
 I
 think


critical.


>> How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 the
 relationship


between
 consistency
 and
 intensity?


>> Intensity
 makes
 for
 a
 good
 story.
 You


know,
 it's
 like,
 oh,
 I
 went
 to
 a
 silent


meditation
 retreat
 for
 a
 week,
 you
 know,


or
 I
 um
 I
 ran
 a
 marathon.
 Um
 you
 know,


we
 launched
 this
 product
 faster
 than
 any


other
 had
 been
 launched
 or
 what,
 you


know,
 intensity
 makes
 for
 a
 good
 story,


but
 consistency
 makes
 progress.
 You


know,
 it's
 not
 about
 like,
 oh,
 I
 did
 a


silent
 meditation
 for
 treat
 for
 a
 week.


It's
 no,
 I,
 you
 know,
 I
 have
 a


meditation
 practice.
 I
 do
 it
 for
 five


minutes
 each
 morning.
 It's
 part
 of
 how
 I


start
 my
 day.
 You
 know,
 that's
 when
 it's


kind
 of
 part
 of
 your
 identity.
 Or,
 you


know,
 I
 I
 go
 for
 a
 run
 three
 days
 a


week.
 I
 really
 love
 how
 it
 makes
 me


feel.


>> Um,
 you
 know,
 that
 now
 it's
 it's
 part
 of


your
 lifestyle.
 So,
 I
 think
 uh
 you
 can


kind
 of
 draw
 this
 distinction
 between


intensity
 is
 often
 about
 the
 story
 that


you
 get
 to
 tell.
 Consistency
 is
 about


the
 lifestyle
 that
 you
 live.
 And
 really


what
 matters
 is
 how
 do
 you
 want
 to
 spend


your
 days?
 You
 know,
 how
 do
 you
 want
 to


show
 up
 as
 a
 person?
 What
 kind
 of


identity
 do
 you
 want
 to
 have?
 And
 the


great
 thing
 is
 that
 if
 you
 do
 a
 good
 job


with
 the
 consistency,
 it
 develops
 your


capacity
 to
 manage
 the
 intensity
 or
 to


handle
 it.
 You
 know,
 I
 I
 like
 this


saying,
 consistency
 enlarges
 ability.
 M


>> by
 being
 more
 consistent,
 you
 enlarge


your
 ability
 to
 handle
 the
 intense


moments,
 to
 do
 the
 peak
 performances,
 to


do
 the
 more
 impressive
 things.
 But
 it


needs
 to
 start
 with
 a
 focus
 on


consistency
 and
 lifestyle.
 And
 by
 doing


it
 in
 that
 way,
 you
 flex
 those
 muscles


sometimes
 literally
 uh
 and
 develop
 that


ability.


>> One
 thing
 you've
 written
 on
 recently
 is


the
 relationship
 between
 belonging
 and


accuracy.
 And
 I'm
 wondering
 if
 you
 can


riff
 on
 that
 for
 a
 second.


Humans
 are
 very
 social
 creatures.
 You


know,
 we
 care
 a
 lot
 about
 what
 other


people
 think
 about
 us.
 We
 are
 focused
 on


status
 and
 prestige.
 We
 want
 to
 rise
 up


the
 social
 hierarchy
 and
 be
 praised
 and


rewarded.
 And
 all
 of
 that
 is
 very


natural
 and
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.
 You


know,
 people
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 time
 people


will
 tell
 you
 don't
 care
 what
 other


people
 think
 about
 you.
 But
 we
 all
 care


what
 other
 people
 think
 often
 for
 a
 very


good
 reason,
 which
 is
 if
 people
 think


well
 of
 you,
 it
 benefits
 you
 in
 life.


it,
 you
 know,
 it
 puts
 you
 in
 a
 good


position.
 You
 are
 rewarded
 for
 it.
 It


helps
 you
 accomplish
 things.
 It
 makes


you
 safer.
 It
 it it
 just
 feels
 good.
 Um


and
 so


belonging
 is
 a
 critical
 part
 of
 being


human.
 Um
 however,


especially
 in
 the
 modern
 world,
 the


desire
 to
 belong
 can
 offer
 often
 run


counter
 to
 the
 desire
 to
 understand
 or


be
 accurate.
 Um,
 and
 so


if
 you
 have
 to
 choose
 between,
 well,
 I


could
 believe
 this
 thing
 and
 be


ostracized
 or
 criticized
 or
 outcast
 from


my
 community,
 or
 I
 could
 believe
 this


other
 thing,
 which
 may
 not
 be
 that


accurate,
 but
 it
 will
 get
 me
 praised
 and


rewarded
 and
 accepted
 by
 my
 community.


A
 lot
 of the
 time,
 the
 desire
 to
 belong


overpowers
 the
 desire
 to
 understand.
 It


puts
 you
 in
 a
 position
 where
 you're


like,
 well,
 you
 know,
 I
 could
 believe


this
 fact
 that
 may
 or
 may
 not
 impact
 my


daily
 life,
 or
 I
 could
 keep
 a
 good


relationship
 with
 my
 wife
 and
 my
 best


friend
 and
 my,
 you
 know,
 co-workers
 and


so
 on.
 Um,
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 choose


the
 belonging
 over
 the
 accuracy.


>> Do
 you
 think
 that
 applies
 outside
 of


social
 groups
 too
 to
 our
 identity?
 Like


if
 I
 identify
 as
 a
 Republican
 or


Democrat,
 then
 this
 thought
 has
 the


exact
 same
 impact.
 So
 earlier
 in
 this


conversation
 we
 talked
 about
 the
 power


that
 identity
 can
 have
 in
 building


habits
 right
 like
 as
 you
 start
 to


practice
 a
 habit
 you
 foster
 an
 identity


and
 that
 puts
 you
 in
 a
 stronger
 place


because
 once
 you
 take
 pride
 in
 being


that
 kind
 of
 person
 you
 will
 fight
 to


maintain
 the
 habit
 you
 fight
 to
 be
 the


type
 of
 person
 who
 doesn't
 miss
 workouts


the
 type
 of
 person
 who
 meditates
 each


day
 or
 the
 type
 of
 person
 who
 writes


consistently
 or
 whatever
 it
 is
 um


because
 it's
 part
 of
 who
 you
 see


yourself
 to
 be.
 But
 now
 we
 see
 that


there's
 also
 a
 flip
 side
 to
 this
 or
 a


dark
 side,
 a
 shadow
 side
 to
 identity,


which
 is
 the
 tighter
 you
 cling
 to
 an


identity,
 the
 harder
 it
 becomes
 to
 grow


beyond
 it.
 And
 so
 once
 you
 have
 started


to
 identify
 as
 a
 certain
 type
 of
 person,


once
 you
 adopt
 that
 label,
 oh,
 I
 am
 a


member
 of
 this
 group
 or
 I
 am
 the
 type
 of


person
 who
 believes
 this
 thing,
 it


becomes
 hard
 to
 stretch
 and
 grow
 outside


of
 that.
 And
 so
 eventually
 what
 you


realize
 is
 that
 you
 simultaneously
 need


to
 have
 two
 things.
 You
 need
 to
 be


casting
 votes
 for
 the
 type
 of
 person


that
 you
 wish
 to
 become,
 building
 up


evidence
 of
 that
 identity
 that
 you
 want.


But
 you
 also
 need
 to
 realize
 that
 your


identity
 does
 not
 have
 to
 be
 fixed.
 You


know,
 identity
 is
 an
 interesting
 word


because
 there's
 pieces
 of
 it
 that
 you


can't
 really
 get
 around.
 Like
 I
 am
 a


male
 and
 a
 father
 and
 tall
 and
 those
 are


all
 aspects
 that
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 change


about
 my
 identity.
 But
 there
 are
 other


aspects
 of
 my
 identity
 that
 can
 be


adjusted
 and
 can
 be,
 you
 know,
 uh,


refined.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 a
 writer.
 I


don't
 always
 have
 to
 be
 a
 writer.
 That's


part
 of
 my
 identity
 right
 now.
 I
 could


shift
 to
 something
 else.


>> And
 so,
 I
 sort
 of
 view
 it
 as
 like
 a


painting
 that's
 always
 being
 retouched


and
 kind
 of
 edited.
 And
 so,
 you're


you're
 slightly
 adjusting
 the
 picture.


And
 what
 you
 realize
 is
 that
 progress,


both
 physical
 progress,
 but
 also
 mental


internal
 progress
 requires
 unlearning.


>> It
 requires
 the
 willingness
 to
 unlearn


some
 of
 the
 identities
 that
 we
 have.
 And


you
 see
 that
 when
 people
 are
 not
 willing


to
 do
 that,
 they
 often
 get
 stuck.
 You


know,
 it's
 like
 the
 it's
 the
 surgeon
 who


you
 can
 imagine
 a
 surgeon
 who's
 done
 an


operation
 a
 certain
 way
 for
 20
 years
 and


then
 all
 of a
 sudden
 a
 new
 form
 of


robotics
 comes
 in
 or
 something
 that


changes
 it
 and
 they
 say,
 "Well,
 look,
 I


have
 all
 these
 patients
 that
 I've
 served


well
 for
 20
 years
 who
 had
 good
 outcomes.


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 switch,
 but
 5
 years


later,
 they're
 behind
 the
 curve."
 um
 or


a
 teacher
 who
 has
 the
 same
 lesson
 plan


they've
 been
 doing
 for
 15
 years
 and
 then


all
 of a
 sudden
 they
 should
 update
 and


use
 new
 tools
 or
 bring
 YouTube
 in
 or


whatever
 and
 they
 don't
 and
 now
 all
 of a


sudden
 they're
 starting
 to
 lose
 the


students.


>> And
 it
 goes
 back
 to
 that
 that
 line
 where


the
 only
 bad
 mindset
 is
 the
 one
 that


you're
 fixed
 in.


>> You
 know,
 it's
 the
 one
 it's
 the
 one
 that


you
 can't
 get
 out
 of.
 If
 you're
 stuck
 in


this
 one
 way
 of
 thinking
 or
 one
 form
 of


an
 identity,
 then
 you're
 not
 growing


anymore.
 And
 so,
 uh,
 identity
 is
 both
 a


powerful
 driver
 of
 change
 and
 a
 force


that
 can
 help
 you
 establish
 a
 habit,
 but


it
 also
 can
 be
 a
 pitfall
 to
 uh
 the
 next


round
 of
 change
 and
 a
 reason
 that
 you


use
 to
 prevent
 yourself
 from
 moving


forward.


>> What's
 your
 exact
 process
 for
 learning


new
 subjects
 as
 an
 adult?


>> I
 don't
 know
 that
 I
 have
 an
 exact


process.
 Uh
 although
 now
 that
 you
 say


that
 so
 okay
 this
 is
 kind
 of


interesting.
 I
 don't
 have
 an
 exact


process
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 I
 haven't


written
 it
 down.
 I
 I
 don't
 have
 I
 don't


have
 like
 some
 template
 to
 give
 you
 but


I
 do
 have
 a
 pattern
 that
 I
 go
 through


very
 consistently
 when
 I'm
 trying
 to


learn
 something
 new.
 Um
 I
 think
 some
 of


this
 is
 my
 personality
 and
 how
 it
 gets


expressed
 uh
 or
 maybe
 maybe
 like
 a


strength
 even.
 Um
 and
 some
 of
 it
 is


probably
 applicable
 to
 everybody.
 So
 I


really
 like
 living
 by
 this
 little


principle
 of
 broadfunnel
 tight
 filter.


>> And
 so
 I
 try
 to
 cast
 a
 really
 wide
 net


when
 I'm
 learning
 something
 new.
 I
 want


to
 read
 and
 consume
 an
 enormous
 amount


of
 information.
 It's
 very
 common
 for
 me


to
 have
 like
 40
 tabs
 open.
 You
 know,
 I


just
 I'll
 I'll
 do
 a
 search
 like
 here


here's
 an
 example
 from
 when
 I
 was


working
 on
 Atomic
 Habits.
 I
 I
 found


Reddit
 really
 helpful
 when
 I
 was
 working


on
 certain
 sections
 of
 the
 book.
 So,
 I


would
 search
 things
 like,
 uh,
 what's
 the


best
 habit
 you've
 ever
 built,
 Reddit,
 or


what's
 one
 habit
 that
 you
 struggled


with,
 Reddit.
 And
 if
 you
 you
 search


those
 terms,
 it'll
 pull
 up,
 you
 know,
 20


or
 30
 different
 threads.
 And
 so,
 I
 would


open
 all
 of
 those.
 So,
 I'd
 have
 like
 50


tabs
 open
 on
 there.
 And
 then
 I
 would
 go


through
 and
 I
 would
 read
 all
 the


comments
 in
 each
 thread.
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 it


wasn't
 really
 that
 relevant,
 but
 I
 would


probably
 find
 after
 I
 do
 that,
 I
 would


probably
 find
 six
 or
 seven
 or
 eight


phrases
 that
 I
 really
 liked
 that
 I
 was


like,
 "Oh,
 that's
 a
 good
 description
 of


like
 a
 real
 problem
 somebody
 had."
 And


then
 I
 put
 all
 those
 into
 a
 list


together.
 And
 so
 what
 I'm
 doing,
 I
 mean,


what
 I'm
 learning
 is
 I'm
 learning
 what


people
 struggle
 with
 with
 habits.
 I'm


learning,
 you
 know,
 where
 did
 they


succeed
 and
 where
 did
 they
 fail?
 And
 so


I
 do
 that
 broad
 funnel
 and
 then
 I
 have
 a


really
 tight
 filter
 for
 what
 gets
 out.


Look
 at
 50
 tabs,
 end
 up
 with
 eight


sentences.
 And
 I
 just
 would
 run
 that


cycle
 again
 and
 again
 and
 again.
 So


maybe
 I
 do
 it
 on
 Reddit
 for
 some
 stuff.


I
 do
 it
 on
 I
 ran
 a
 survey
 with
 my


audience
 for
 another.
 Um
 look
 at
 social


media
 comments.
 Look
 at
 comments
 on
 I


used
 to
 a
 long
 long
 time
 ago
 I
 used
 to


have
 comments
 on
 my
 website.
 So
 maybe


look
 at
 that.
 Go
 to
 the
 newsletter,
 go


to
 my
 inbox,
 look
 at
 the
 replies
 that


I've
 gotten
 from
 people
 through
 the


newsletter.
 Like
 that's
 another
 one.
 So


you
 you
 just
 do
 these
 really
 broad
 data


sets
 and
 then
 you
 have
 a
 really
 tight


funnel
 for
 what
 uh
 for
 what
 gets
 through


and
 you
 end
 up
 with
 some
 really
 high


quality
 stuff
 that
 way.
 The
 tricky
 part


about
 learning
 that
 way
 is
 it
 requires
 a


lot
 of
 persistence.


>> This
 is
 where
 I
 I
 said
 like
 I
 think
 some


of
 it's
 my
 personality.
 Uh
 one
 strength


for
 me
 something
 I'm
 good
 at
 is
 I
 can


concentrate
 on
 something
 for
 a
 very
 long


time.
 So
 I
 I
 could
 do
 that
 for
 8
 10
 12


hours
 in
 a
 day
 and
 I
 would
 just
 spend
 it


doing
 that
 and
 I
 will
 just
 go
 through


all
 those
 tabs
 and
 do
 the
 whole
 thing.
 A


lot
 of
 people
 don't
 like
 that.
 The
 flip


side
 of
 that,
 a
 weakness
 for
 me
 is
 I'm


not
 as
 good
 at
 compartmentalizing.
 So
 if


I
 had
 that
 same
 eight
 hour
 day,
 but
 it


was
 split
 up
 on
 like
 six
 different


meetings,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 like
 that.
 I


don't
 I'm
 not
 good
 at
 the
 task
 switching


between
 each
 one.
 Uh
 it's
 too
 much.
 My


mind
 feels
 really
 scattered.
 But
 if
 I


can
 lock
 in
 and
 just
 do
 one
 task
 for
 the


whole
 time,
 that
 feels
 great.
 So
 my


approach
 to
 learning
 is
 usually


something
 like
 that.
 Let
 me
 let
 me
 get
 a


really
 broad
 data
 set
 and
 just
 read


super
 widely
 and
 then
 I'm
 just
 going
 to


try
 to
 identify
 the
 most
 meaningful


piece
 in
 each
 one
 and
 gradually
 like


collect
 that
 into
 one
 area.


>> I
 don't
 know if
 it
 was
 you
 that
 told
 me


this
 or
 somebody
 else,
 but
 you
 had
 went


through
 Amazon
 reviews
 for
 all
 these


books
 as
 well.
 That
 was
 another
 big


piece
 I
 so
 I
 went
 through
 um
 you
 know
 I


am
 not
 the
 first
 person
 to
 write
 about


habits
 right
 and
 I
 won't
 be
 the
 last
 and


so
 I
 looked
 at
 some
 of
 the
 books
 that


had
 come
 out
 before
 me
 power
 of
 habits


seven
 habits
 of
 highly
 effective
 people


you
 know
 books
 like
 this
 that
 had


already
 been
 written
 on
 habits
 and
 I


went
 to
 the
 three
 star
 reviews
 on
 Amazon


one
 star
 review
 everybody
 hates
 it
 often


for
 some
 stupid
 reason
 like
 the
 book


showed
 up
 and
 it
 was
 dirty
 on
 the
 dust


jacket
 or
 whatever
 um
 five
 star
 review


everybody
 loves
 it
 um
 but
 the
 three
 star


reviews
 or
 the
 four-st
 star
 reviews.


Those
 are
 pretty
 useful.
 You
 know,
 it's


it's
 usually
 a
 person
 who
 liked
 the


book,
 but
 they
 had
 some
 complaint
 about


it.
 And
 so,
 I
 would
 look
 at
 all
 these


different
 reviews,
 not
 just
 for
 those


two
 books,
 but
 other
 ones
 as
 well.
 And
 I


was
 just
 trying
 to
 map
 the
 like
 habits


book
 universe.
 What
 what
 have
 what
 has


already
 been
 written?
 What
 do
 people


like
 about
 what's
 been
 written
 and
 what


feels
 like
 it's
 missing?
 And
 the
 primary


thing
 that
 came
 up
 is
 these
 books
 are


really
 good
 at
 explaining
 habits
 or
 they


help
 me
 understand
 them
 but
 I
 still
 am


left
 wondering
 how
 do
 I
 apply
 it.
 And
 so


once
 I
 saw
 that
 enough
 times
 I
 thought


all
 right
 I
 can
 be
 the
 practical
 guy
 you


know
 I
 can
 be
 the
 one
 who
 translates


this
 and
 makes
 habits
 actionable.
 And
 so


my
 little
 objective
 was
 I'm
 going
 to
 try


to
 write
 the
 most
 useful
 actionable


guide
 on
 building
 good
 habits
 and


breaking
 bad
 ones
 that's
 ever
 been


written.
 And
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 I


actually
 achieved
 that
 or
 not.
 But
 that


was
 the
 objective,
 right?
 It's
 back
 to


what
 we
 talked
 about
 earlier.
 If
 you


don't
 strive
 for
 that,
 you're
 never


going
 to
 just
 stumble
 into
 that
 outcome.


You
 know,
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 like,


well,
 I
 just
 decided
 to
 write
 a
 book
 and


it
 turns
 out
 it
 was
 the
 most
 actionable


one
 ever.
 You
 know,
 like
 it's
 not
 you


need
 to
 actually
 try
 to
 reach
 for
 that.


Um,
 and
 so
 I
 I
 decided
 that
 that
 was
 one


project
 where
 I
 was
 going
 to
 do
 that.


And
 research
 methods
 like
 looking
 at


those
 reviews
 is
 one
 way
 to
 try
 to


accomplish
 that.
 You
 don't
 get
 out
 of


bed
 and
 become
 Michael
 Jordan,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 it's,
 you
 know,
 it's


so
 it's
 it's
 like
 the
 classic
 like
 I


don't
 want
 to
 work
 out
 too
 much
 because


I
 don't
 want
 to
 look
 like
 a
 bodybuilder.


And
 you're
 like,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 like
 I've


been
 trying
 to
 look
 like
 a
 bodybuilder


for
 15
 years.
 I
 still
 am
 not
 there
 yet.


You
 know,
 it's
 like
 it
 takes
 a
 long


time.
 You
 need
 a
 lot
 of
 effort.


>> How
 do
 you
 think
 about
 prioritization?


>> Um,
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 comes
 back
 to
 what
 we


talked
 about
 earlier
 about
 can
 I
 find


things
 that
 have
 tailwinds,
 that
 have


leverage,
 that
 accumulate,
 that
 feed


each
 other.
 Um,
 and
 so
 if
 I
 find


something
 that
 checks
 a
 lot
 of
 those


boxes,
 that
 feels
 pretty
 high
 priority.


I
 have
 this
 new
 thing
 I've
 been
 trying,


which
 is
 I
 I
 bought
 a
 bunch
 of
 wooden


clothes
 pins,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 the
 little


like
 and
 they're
 like
 kind
 of
 flat
 on


one
 side
 so
 you
 can
 write
 on
 them.


>> And
 I
 hung
 a
 string
 from
 my
 office


ceiling
 and
 on
 so
 I
 got
 like
 50
 of
 these


and
 on
 each
 clothes
 pin.
 So,
 I
 wrote


each
 of
 my
 kids'
 names
 on
 one
 and
 then
 I


wrote
 working
 out
 on
 another
 one.
 And


then
 I
 have
 all
 these
 projects
 that
 I


want
 to
 do.
 You
 know,
 I've
 got
 I've
 got


stuff
 that
 makes
 sense
 that
 you
 would


want
 to
 do
 like,
 you
 know,
 writing


another
 book
 or
 things
 that
 you
 would


expect.
 And
 then
 I
 got
 like
 totally


other
 stuff
 like
 a
 film
 idea
 that
 I


would
 like
 or
 like
 some
 idea
 for
 a
 music


label
 or,
 you
 know,
 things
 that
 are
 like


outside
 of
 my
 my
 normal
 focus.
 But
 try


to
 write
 all
 these
 ideas
 down
 and
 then
 I


put
 like
 a
 red
 line
 across
 the
 string


and
 the
 question
 is
 what
 earns
 its
 way


above
 the
 line.
 Obviously
 my
 kids
 are


going
 to
 go
 above
 it.


>> Obviously
 working
 out
 is
 going
 to
 go


above
 it.
 But
 I
 have
 an
 incre
 what
 feels


like
 I
 have
 every
 year
 especially
 with


each
 additional
 kid
 you
 add.
 It
 feels


like
 you
 have
 fewer
 and
 fewer
 hours.


Yeah.


>> Right.


>> Um
 and
 so
 the
 time
 is
 precious.
 And
 so
 I


look
 at
 the
 rest
 of
 these
 projects
 and
 I


say,
 "Is
 this
 good
 enough
 to
 earn
 its


way
 above
 the
 line?"
 And
 um
 I
 need
 that


visual
 reminder.
 One
 of
 the
 there
 are
 a


lot
 of
 things
 in
 life
 that
 are
 like


this,
 but
 one
 of
 the
 challenging
 things


about
 the
 really
 important
 stuff
 in
 life


is
 that
 they're
 endless
 battles.
 You


know,
 if
 you
 do
 a
 good
 job
 focusing


today
 and
 prioritizing
 today,
 you
 pick


the
 right
 thing
 to
 focus
 on,
 it
 earns


you
 no
 bonus
 points
 for
 tomorrow.


tomorrow.
 Tomorrow
 you
 show
 up
 and
 uh
 if


you
 spend
 all
 that
 time
 on
 YouTube
 or


getting
 distracted
 or
 whatever,
 like


that
 day
 is
 gone.
 And
 so
 other
 things


are
 like
 that
 too.
 Like
 just
 because
 you


worked
 out
 two
 weeks
 ago
 doesn't
 mean


you
 don't
 need
 to
 do
 it
 today.
 You
 know,


just
 because
 you
 were
 a
 good
 spouse


yesterday
 earns
 you
 no
 bonus
 points
 for


today.
 You
 still
 need
 to
 show
 up
 for


them.


>> Um
 and
 so


>> I'm
 trying
 to
 get
 comfortable
 with
 that


endless
 nature
 of
 those
 things.
 A
 lot
 of


the
 time
 we
 try
 to
 resist
 the
 endless


nature
 of
 that
 stuff.
 Oh,
 I
 wish
 it


wasn't
 that
 way.
 We
 want
 to
 We
 try
 to


convince
 ourselves
 that
 it's
 like
 a


finish
 line.
 Oh,
 if
 I
 just
 do
 this
 21day


cleanse,
 then
 I'll
 be
 a
 healthy
 person


and
 I
 won't
 have
 to
 think
 about
 it


anymore.
 Yeah.
 You
 know,
 oh,
 if
 I
 just,


you
 know,
 buy
 her
 something
 nice
 for
 her


anniversary,
 then
 I
 can
 like
 stop


worrying
 about
 it
 and
 I
 don't
 have
 to,


you
 know,
 it's
 like,
 no,
 it's
 not
 like


that.
 It's,
 you
 know,
 it's
 endless.


>> And
 as
 soon
 as
 you
 accept
 the
 endless


nature,
 then
 you
 start
 looking
 at
 it


differently.
 You
 say,
 okay,
 it's
 not


about
 getting
 to
 a
 particular
 finish


line.
 It's
 about
 living
 a
 daily
 life


that
 feels
 sustainable
 and
 that
 I
 like


and
 that
 I'm
 fully
 engaged
 in.
 So,
 it's


about
 liking
 my
 days.
 Um,
 so
 I
 use
 all


of
 that
 lens
 as
 I
 look
 at
 this
 string


and
 ask
 myself
 which
 clothes
 pins
 get
 to


go
 above
 the
 line.
 Um,
 and
 that's
 one


that's
 one
 way
 to
 prioritize
 it.
 Uh,
 and


I
 I
 find
 that
 having
 the
 visual
 marker


helps
 remind
 me
 the
 next
 day
 when
 I


forgot
 that
 I
 just
 did
 that
 exercise
 and


I
 feel
 like
 getting
 pulled
 into,
 you


know,
 the
 next
 shiny
 thing.
 I
 I
 love


that
 because
 it
 visualizes
 what
 so
 many


of
 us
 uh
 are
 dealing
 with
 right
 now.


>> One
 of
 the
 really
 key
 pieces
 of
 building


a
 habit
 then
 getting
 it
 to
 stick
 is


finding
 ways
 to
 visualize
 your
 progress.


So
 if
 you
 look
 at
 technologies
 that
 are


really
 good
 at
 building
 habits,
 they're


great
 at
 visualization.
 You're
 playing
 a


video
 game,
 you
 have
 a
 score
 in
 the
 top


corner
 of
 the
 screen.
 It's
 increasing


all
 the
 time
 as
 you
 go
 through
 the


level.
 Um,
 every
 time
 you
 pick
 up
 a


weapon
 or
 a
 ruby
 or
 a
 gem
 or
 whatever,


there's
 a
 little
 jingle
 or
 a
 chime,


there's
 some
 kind
 of
 power
 up.
 Um,
 even


the
 pitterpatter
 of
 footsteps
 as
 you
 run


through
 the
 level
 is
 a
 signal
 that


you're
 progressing.
 So,
 you
 have
 all


these
 signals
 of
 progress,
 visual
 audio,


like
 it's
 very
 the
 feedback
 is


immediate.
 And
 if
 you
 compare
 that


experience
 of
 just
 like
 playing
 this


level
 for
 15
 minutes
 to
 what
 it's
 like


to
 sit
 down
 and
 try
 to
 write
 a
 blog
 post


or
 record
 a
 podcast
 interview
 or
 do


anything
 in
 the
 normal
 world
 um
 is
 very


different.
 The
 feedback
 comes
 much


slower
 in
 real
 life.
 You
 know,
 my


parents,
 they
 like
 to
 swim.


>> And
 you
 know,
 one
 of the
 challenges
 with


swimming
 is
 your
 body
 looks
 exactly
 the


same
 when
 you
 get
 out
 of
 the
 water
 as
 it


did
 when
 you
 jumped
 in.
 If
 they
 if


they're
 doing
 it
 for
 the
 visual
 results,


I
 mean,
 it
 takes
 two
 years
 for
 your
 body


to
 change
 in
 the
 mirror.
 Um,
 and
 so
 they


have
 a
 little
 habit
 tracker
 where
 they


just
 put
 an
 X
 down
 for
 each
 day
 they
 do


their
 workout
 and
 then
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


month
 they
 count
 up
 how
 many
 workouts


they
 did
 and
 compare
 that
 to
 the
 month


before.
 And
 putting
 that
 X
 down
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 workout
 is
 like
 such
 a
 small


little
 thing,
 but
 it's
 one
 little
 visual


signal
 that
 we
 showed
 up
 and
 we
 did
 the


right
 thing
 today,
 you
 know,
 that
 I
 I


did
 what
 I
 was
 supposed
 to
 do.
 It's
 a


way
 of
 visualizing
 your
 progress.
 And
 so


finding
 ways
 to
 visualize
 your
 progress


as
 you
 go
 through
 your
 habits
 um
 is


important
 because
 a
 a
 hallmark
 of
 almost


any
 compounding
 process
 is
 that
 the


greatest
 returns
 are
 delayed.
 You
 know,


it's
 it's
 not
 till
 later
 that
 you
 get
 to


the
 hockey
 stick
 portion.
 So
 the
 in
 the


moment
 right
 now,
 you
 do
 the
 right
 thing


and
 you
 feel
 like
 I
 have
 nothing
 to
 show


for
 it.
 So
 finding
 ways
 to
 visualize


that
 can
 be
 helpful
 for
 getting
 habits


to
 stick.


>> We
 always
 end
 with
 the
 same
 question


which
 is
 what
 is
 success
 for
 you?
 I


think
 the
 short
 version
 is
 success
 is


having
 power
 over
 my
 days.
 That's,
 you


know,
 if
 I
 if
 I
 have
 the
 the
 freedom
 and


the
 ability
 to
 choose
 how
 I'm
 spending


my
 days,
 that
 sounds
 that
 sounds
 great.


What
 more
 could
 you
 want
 than
 that?
 You


know,
 that
 means
 I
 would
 get
 to
 choose


to
 spend
 time
 with
 my
 kids
 if
 I
 have


kids.
 Before
 I
 had
 kids,
 it
 meant
 I


could
 choose
 to
 travel
 or
 to
 work
 on


projects
 that
 I
 wanted.
 Um,
 you
 know,


after
 my
 kids
 are
 grown,
 it'll
 mean
 that


I
 can
 choose
 to
 dive
 into
 new
 things.


Like
 it,
 you
 know,
 what
 what
 more
 could


you
 want
 than
 that
 than
 to
 have
 control


over
 your
 time?
 So
 I
 think
 uh
 to
 have


power
 over
 my
 days
 is
 the
 version
 for
 me


internally
 and
 then
 um
 to
 contribute
 my


little
 bit
 to
 the
 world
 around
 me
 is
 the


external
 focus.
 What
 does
 what
 does


success
 look
 like
 um
 on
 the
 outside?
 I


think
 it's
 adding
 your
 little
 bit
 to
 the


pile
 of
 knowledge
 for
 humanity.
 I
 mean


one
 of
 the
 one
 of
 the
 great
 gifts
 of


humankind
 is
 that
 you
 get
 to
 inherit
 the


lessons
 of
 the
 hundred
 billion
 people


that
 have
 come
 before
 you.
 you
 know,
 my


kids
 are
 going
 to
 school
 now
 and
 they


start
 30
 years
 ahead
 of
 where
 I
 got
 to


start.
 You
 know,
 all
 the
 things
 we've


learned
 from
 the
 last
 30
 years
 are
 going


to
 be
 taught
 to
 them
 when
 when
 they
 go


and
 that's
 what
 helps
 them
 kick
 the
 ball


of
 humanity
 forward.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,


if
 I
 could
 add
 just
 some
 little
 bit
 to


that,
 then
 I
 feel
 like
 that's
 that's


definitely
 a
 success.


>> I
 love
 that.
 Thank
 you.
 This
 was


awesome.
 This
 was
 a
 great
 conversation.


>> You
 bet.
 Thanks
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me.
