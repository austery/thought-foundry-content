What happened on September 23, 1999?
This is the day
that the Mars Climate Orbiter
went on a mission to Mars
and actually failed considerably.
This was this device
that NASA sent over to Mars.
It was designed
to measure the weather on Mars,
and also to serve
as this communication device
for the Mars Polar Lander,
which was supposed to arrive
a couple of months later.
It just completely failed.
It hit the atmosphere,
burst into a million pieces,
leaving the folks who worked at NASA
befuddled, upset, pretty pissed off.
These are not them.
You have to use your imagination
a little bit in this talk.
Now these things happen.
Sending things into space
is tricky business,
and quite frankly, as a psychologist,
who am I to judge
a bunch of very smart engineers
who work for NASA
for failing and having a bad day at work?
But what makes this story
extra special and super fascinating
from my perspective
is that the entire failure
comes down to one thing:
failed communication
between these team members,
and more specifically,
the people working on this project
were not talking to each other
about the right stuff at the right time.
It really is that simple.
So I'm going to break this down for you.
So it all started when they
had to calculate the flight path.
So any time you send something into space,
you have to tell it where to go.
And to do so you have to
calculate the flight path.
Now the folks working at NASA
for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
they calculated the flight path
using the metric system,
and so they had the newton
as their unit of force.
Those working at Lockheed Martin,
they were using the pound
as their unit of force.
When you're using
these two different systems,
the whole thing was off
by a factor of about 4.4.
Now at no point did the folks at NASA say,
"Hey guys, you're using
the newton as a unit of force, right?"
"No, guys. We were using the pound."
That conversation never actually happened.
And so we have our first
big communication mishap.
Two sets of teams failed
to communicate about basic information
that seemed pretty obvious to everybody.
And just to put things into perspective,
imagine instead of sending
something into space,
these folks were making a cake.
And if I thought
I was using a pound of butter
and you thought we were using
a kilogram of butter --
that's about 2.2 pounds of butter --
your cake would end up
tasting pretty gross,
like this one looks here.
Now before we get too judgey about this --
it sounds pretty silly --
we do this all the time.
We walk into meetings.
You know, if we get lucky,
there's that annoying,
overly conscientious person
who says things like,
before we get started,
everyone, let's level set
and talk about, you know,
whether there's ink in the printer
at the newspaper we work
or whatever obvious thing
they want to get on the same page with.
And we usually
roll our eyes at this person
and we tell them to stop talking
because we want the meeting to end soon,
and we want to get on
to the important stuff.
And we say things like,
"We've done this a million times,
do we really need
to cover that kind of thing?"
And the answer is yes,
we should have that 22nd conversation
so that our probe does not explode
when it hits the atmosphere.
But we often do not do this.
Now the good news is this is NASA.
There is no single point of failure.
And so just because
you miscalculate your flight path
doesn't mean the whole mission
is going to actually end
in just a complete failure.
And so people started noticing
things were wrong.
And the good news is you can actually
recalculate a flight path.
So people started bringing this up
in various meetings,
and they even had a conference about it.
But then there was
a big mistake that happened.
Communication mishap number two.
The people holding
that critical information
were ignored for a very dumb reason
that I'm pretty sure everyone
in this room can recognize.
They did not fill out the right form.
Now all of us know that if you send
an important message over Slack
and everybody was on email,
or over email and everybody was on Slack,
we just miss that critical information.
But we don't think that a failure
to fill out the right form
is going to be the difference
between our mission to Mars
failing and succeeding.
We think that critical information
will eventually make its way
to the important people at the top.
But often this is not the case.
We get very married to our processes,
and these can actually
be our Achilles heel
in really important
group decision-making contexts.
Things didn't end here.
There were actually some
last-ditch efforts to save this mission
that didn't go so well.
Someone got on the phone
with another person.
They sounded urgent about fixing it,
but that person didn't
actually recognize urgency.
I think the quote
was something around like,
"They didn't sound anxious enough",
and so they weren't taken seriously.
So this miscommunication
also worked around nonverbal behaviors,
tone of voice and so on and so forth.
So there's lots of ways
in which this mission went awry.
But I've been studying miscommunication
for over 20 years now,
and I have to say that
what actually happened at NASA
is much more the norm than the exception.
That even when people are making
really critical decisions,
they often fall flat on their faces,
and often for these very simple reasons.
And this is the case
even when we give people
every piece of information they need
to make the right choice.
So now I want to talk
about a very classic experiment
done in social science.
So imagine that you're sitting
in a room with these people
and your job is simple.
It's to hire the best job candidate
among a list of four.
And we give you
all the information you need.
Everyone is handed a piece of paper
with a bunch of information
about all of those job candidates.
Information like,
"Applicant A is disorganized,"
"Applicant B has
strong leadership skills,"
"Applicant C has won
many cake baking awards."
A lot of this information
is what we're going to call
overlapping information
or shared information.
Everybody has it. But here's the trick.
One special member of this team
has what's called unique information,
special information about applicant C
that only they have.
And here's how this task goes.
If this person does not share
that unique information,
applicant C will come across
as the worst job candidate.
If they do share this unique information,
applicant C is going to come across
as the best applicant.
So just to be clear,
the only thing that needs to happen
for this team to make the right choice
is that this special person shares
the information about applicant C,
the team hears it,
incorporates into their decision making,
and they indeed pick the right person.
Now much like the real world,
people don't know exactly
which pieces of information
everyone else has.
They just know some is overlapping
and some is not.
This is called the hidden profile task.
It is a very tried and true task,
and researchers from the University
of Southern California
did a huge analysis over 40 years of this
and found that most of the time,
teams make the wrong choice.
By and large, small teams, big teams,
you know, huge teams, tiny teams,
teams online, teams in person,
teams in which the person
who is holding that unique information
is an expert.
Doesn't matter.
And I have actually found
in my own research of about 370 teams,
20 percent unanimously pick applicant C.
So the question is, what's going on here?
Well the obvious explanation,
and one that we often see
is that teams focus
on that shared information the most.
They kind of throw around
the stuff that they all know.
They focus very little on that
critical information about applicant C
that only one person knows.
And so what we learned
is these critical pieces of information
are incredibly fragile.
They're like little pieces
of information in the wind
that can kind of blow away.
And because of this,
we lose this information,
but we can't actually tell
that our interactions with one another
aren't going as well as we think they are.
And critically,
because in these interactions
everyone is motivated
to make the right decision,
no one person is trying to bulldoze
or push their person through,
these team interactions
actually feel good,
and so we can be communicating
terribly and not know it,
because the red flags
that we usually look for,
those interruptions
and so on and so forth,
simply aren't there,
making this type of poor communication
just really clever
and underneath the surface
of what's going on
in these team interactions.
Now in this study, people are all speaking
the same language, quite literally,
but also social scientists are very good
about holding things constant
that could potentially
explain this effect.
Use of jargon, use of, you know,
different types of cultural languages
and so on and so forth.
But in the real world,
that is not how we talk.
We show up to these interactions
using all kinds of different languages.
And I don't mean that literally.
I mean the local languages
that we often develop in our communities,
in our friend groups, in our workplaces.
Acronyms, synonyms, turns of phrases
that we use all the time
and we don't even realize it.
And we often call these things
hidden languages.
And they are everywhere.
You probably have already used
50 of them today
without even realizing it.
They're all over our resumes,
often in the forms
of random letters strung together
that very few people recognize.
And these are great.
They actually make our lives
more efficient
and they build a sense of community,
they build a sense of identity.
But if you don't know them --
and most of us know
what it feels like to sit in a meeting
where people are using them
and we don't know them --
you feel really stupid and left out,
and it's awkward to actually
ask people what they mean.
Things like, "Let's get this done ASAP."
"I hold a BA, MBA and I'm the CEO."
This person is very proud
and they're showing it
with all of these letters.
"Yeet," which I've learned is a thing.
It is both a verb and a noun.
"I yeeted the ball, I am yeet."
I think that's true.
I probably got that one wrong.
"That idea is cringe."
"NASA."
And sometimes these things
actually disappear
just as quickly as they show up.
I'm not allowed to say "cringe" anymore,
according to my 12-year-old.
Now if anyone's ever gone
to another country,
you realize some
of these things don't track.
I have a lot of German colleagues
who've told me that there's a phrase
that says something like,
"It's all train station to me."
That is a terrible
English translation of a German phrase
that means something like,
“It’s all Greek.”
which also doesn't make a ton of sense.
So we use these phrases all of the time,
and they can infiltrate
the ways in which we speak.
But one thing you probably don't realize
is just how quickly they actually develop.
And so some researchers from Caltech
showed this through
this very clever experiment.
They handed people photos of offices
that looked nearly identical
to each other,
and in pairs, they had them describe
these photos to one another,
and they looked at how quickly
they actually came up
with their own hidden languages.
So at first they started off
pretty slowly.
"This one has a computer, three ferns,
a cup of coffee, so on and so forth."
"This one has a computer,
headphones, a cup of coffee, a phone."
But over time, and by overtime
I mean a matter of minutes,
they got very efficient.
Team A would call this "wall fern."
Team B called this one "tidy vibe."
Why? Nobody knows.
We just know that they do it.
Team A calls this one “lots of stuff”,
and team B calls this one
"wannabe writer."
Now imagine that we now have someone
from another team come join yours.
Team A is working well together
and someone from team B joins that team.
What happens? Do they learn
their hidden languages?
Do they start over?
They actually get really irritated
with each other pretty quickly
for not understanding one another.
Team A says, "It's wall fern.
You know, the wall fern."
And team B says something like,
"Stop saying 'wall fern'.
Half of them have wall ferns.
Tell me if there's a tidy vibe."
So we do not actually realize
that these hidden languages
are dominating our conversations,
and they ended up
taking so long to do this,
most of them actually
didn't finish the task at all.
Now there’s this huge theme
here, in this talk,
that we don't know what others don't know.
We don't know if they're on the same page
with ostensibly obvious
pieces of information,
like whether we're using
the newton or the pound
as our unit of force.
We don't know what the hidden languages
are that they're using,
and we don't know if they are
sharing critical information
in the ways that we think they are.
So the question is: “What are we supposed
to do with all of this mess
if we want to make
smarter team decisions?”
So I think the first thing
that we should do
is be that annoying person in the room
who says things like, "Let's level set."
Which, by the way,
is also a hidden language.
State the obvious.
It is a good idea to start those meetings,
to start those conversations,
even if it makes people roll their eyes.
That 22nd conversation
about the obvious thing
that should be going on in that meeting
should happen, and it's OK
to be the one to do it.
It's OK to be the one
to make that the norm in the meeting.
Realize that not all critical information
appears as such or is obvious to everyone.
So in the research I talked about,
they quite literally handed people
all the information they needed
to make the right hiring decision.
But that is not the real world.
We walk into rooms.
We might not know
if our information is critical,
we might think it is,
but there's a norm against sharing it.
So imagine, for instance,
that you are making some
really important decision at work
and your boss is in the room,
and that boss is arguing
to give her direct report Tom a raise.
But you just saw Tom come out
of her hotel room three times
that weekend retreat
you guys got back from.
Should you share that information?
It feels critical to you,
but it could also just be seen
as a nasty little nugget of gossip
if it's shared to the wrong person.
So we often don't know,
there are norms that we could be violating
by sharing critical information.
We might be sitting on something important
and we have no idea
because we are new in the workplace.
Don't assume people are always sharing it.
People are actually more likely
to withhold something
if they're afraid
that they're violating a norm,
or if they're afraid it's not going
to go down as well as they think it might.
It's OK to restate information.
In fact, you should, a few times.
We learned that people often assume
that critical information is shared,
and that's a false assumption.
Make sure that information sticks.
Say it in the way you wanted it to say,
in the way you want it to be heard.
Restate it, and do it a couple of times,
and do it at the end of that interaction,
so that you can make sure
that your message
actually goes out as intended.
It doesn't get restated,
even by a well-meaning
member of your team.
And make it comfortable for people to ask.
"What did you mean by that?"
I think most of us know what it feels like
to be sitting on the other end
of a conversation,
which a lot of jargon is thrown around,
a lot of acronyms,
and we feel silly asking.
But make it a norm to just say,
"What did you mean by that?
What were those letters?
What did that phrase mean?"
We will be much less likely
to be annoyed with one another
when those kinds
of conversations are happening.
No matter what you do,
don't say "wall fern."
Thank you.
(Applause)
