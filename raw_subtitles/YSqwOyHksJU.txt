Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 OddLots
 podcast.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Aloway


>> and
 I'm
 Joe
 Wisenthal.
 Joe,
 I
 keep


thinking
 about
 that
 Sam
 Alman
 hype
 cycle


kind
 of
 phrase,
 the
 whole
 it's
 over
 and


then
 we're
 so
 back
 thing.
 And
 obviously


he
 was
 talking
 about
 AI
 and
 how
 people,


you
 know,
 feel
 about
 AI,
 but
 I
 think
 you


could
 apply
 it
 to
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


markets
 at
 the
 moment.
 So
 AI
 obviously,


but
 also
 private
 credit.
 Think
 back
 to


the
 end
 of
 last
 year,
 right?
 We
 had
 all


the
 JP
 Morgan,
 Jamie
 Diamonds,


proverbial
 cockroaches
 emerging
 from


private
 credit
 and
 people
 started
 to
 get


really
 worried.
 Fast
 forward
 to
 January


2026
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 concerns
 seem
 to


have
 faded
 into
 the
 background.


>> Right.
 You
 wrote
 that
 thing,
 right?
 Like


spreads
 everywhere
 are
 super
 tight
 and


already
 we
 know
 that
 the
 uh
 the
 stock


market
 is
 up
 for
 the
 year,
 but
 credit


market
 is
 off
 to
 a
 very
 strong
 start
 of


all
 flavors
 from
 what
 I
 understand.


>> Right.
 Stock
 markets
 stealing
 all
 the


spotlight.
 But
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


corporate
 bond
 market,
 now
 this
 is
 the


public
 bond
 market,
 not
 private,
 but


spreads
 are,
 you
 know,
 at
 basically


historic
 heights.
 I
 think
 the
 uh
 the


high
 yield
 index
 is
 starting
 at
 its
 like


tightest
 level
 ever
 in
 the
 history
 of


the
 index
 for
 the
 year.
 This
 is
 crazy,


but
 it
 also
 highlights
 an
 important


point
 which
 is
 that
 spreads
 and
 returns


are
 all
 relative.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 And
 so
 if


the
 public
 market
 is
 absolutely
 booming,


that
 could
 be
 a
 good
 thing
 for
 private


credit,
 but
 also
 private
 credit
 competes


with
 the
 public
 market,
 right?
 So
 if


you're
 getting
 pretty
 good
 returns
 in


public
 credit
 or
 leverage
 loans,


something
 like
 that,
 maybe
 you're
 not


going
 into
 private
 credit
 as
 much
 as
 you


used
 to.
 What
 if
 you
 found
 a
 house
 that


just
 had
 one
 cockroach?
 That
 would
 be


Could
 you
 imagine?


>> There's
 never
 one
 cockroach.
 That's
 the


point.


>> There
 had
 to
 have
 been
 a
 first
 cockroach


that
 enters
 the
 house.
 You
 get
 it
 really


quickly
 in
 your
 uh
 and
 then
 you
 don't


have
 a
 cockroach
 problem.


>> Did
 I
 ever
 tell
 you
 I
 hate
 cockroaches


so
 much.
 The
 first
 of
 all,
 the
 first


Japanese
 word
 I
 ever
 relearned
 when
 I


moved
 back
 to
 Japan
 as
 like
 a


14-year-old
 was
 kokori
 hoy
 hoy
 because
 I


had
 to
 go
 down
 to
 the
 local
 kambini,
 the


convenience
 store,
 and
 buy
 cockroach


hotels
 because
 the
 entire
 apartment
 was


infested.
 And
 secondly,
 I
 hate


cockroaches
 so
 much.
 I
 once
 uh
 read
 an


entire
 book
 about
 cockroaches
 just
 to


know
 my
 enemy.


>> Wow.


>> It
 was
 like
 300
 pages
 on
 cockroach.


>> Should
 we
 get
 the
 author
 on
 the
 podcast?


Oh,
 it
 was
 actually
 a
 really
 good
 book.


It
 was
 a
 sort
 of
 like
 cultural
 and


scientific
 study
 of
 the
 history
 of


cockroaches.
 But
 anyway,
 we
 are
 getting


massively
 off
 topic.


>> Shall
 I
 introduce
 our
 guest?
 We
 do,
 in


fact,
 have
 the
 perfect
 guest.
 All right,


so
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 talking
 all
 things


private
 credit,
 including
 how
 private


credit
 is
 relating
 to
 the
 AI
 space.
 At


the
 moment,
 we're
 speaking
 with
 Michael


Zawatsky,
 also
 known
 as
 Z.
 He
 is
 the


global
 chief
 investment
 officer
 for


Blackstone
 Credit.
 So
 Z,
 thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 coming
 on
 the
 podcast.


>> Wonderful
 to
 be
 here.
 Thanks
 for
 having


me.


>> So
 I
 am
 told
 by
 your
 uh
 lovely


Blackstone
 representatives
 that
 over
 the


last
 20
 years
 you
 have
 grown


Blackstone's
 credit
 franchise
 into
 the


largest
 business
 by
 assets
 at


Blackstone.
 How
 hard
 was
 that?
 Were
 you


just
 sort
 of
 like
 riding
 a
 wave
 of


corporate
 issuance?


>> Well,
 let's
 talk
 about
 a
 few
 things
 that


have
 happened
 here.
 You
 know,
 I
 often


get
 asked
 about
 this
 growth
 of
 private


credit
 and
 I
 think
 there's
 a


misconception
 that
 that
 growth
 was


driven
 by
 excess
 risk-taking.
 But
 when


you
 actually
 step
 back
 and
 think
 about


what's
 happened
 in
 the
 market,
 you


basically
 had
 a
 innovative
 breakthrough


that
 changed
 the
 way
 business
 was
 done


that
 was
 better
 for
 all
 market


participants.
 The
 way
 I
 like
 to


analogize
 it
 to
 is
 what
 happened
 with


Amazon
 in
 the
 retail
 space.
 Right?


Before
 Amazon,
 if
 you
 wanted
 to
 go
 buy


something,
 you
 had
 to
 go
 to
 the
 store.


But
 Amazon
 kind
 of
 took
 out
 that


middleman
 and
 brought
 you
 the
 consumer


directly
 to
 the
 manufacturer
 and
 in
 the


process
 created
 something
 that
 was


simpler,
 more
 efficient,
 better
 for
 the


economy,
 more
 transparent.
 What's


private
 credit
 done?
 It's
 done
 the
 same


thing.
 It's
 brought
 the
 borrower
 right


up
 directly
 to
 our
 investors
 capital.
 We


sometimes
 call
 it
 this
 farm-totable


model,
 right?


>> What
 have
 you
 done
 in
 that
 process?


You've
 cut
 out
 all
 the
 middlemen,
 all


the
 syndication,
 all
 the
 trading
 desks,


all
 the
 stuff
 that
 led
 to
 leakage
 along


the
 way.
 And
 in
 the
 process,
 you
 built


something
 that
 was
 better
 for
 all
 market


participants.
 If
 you're
 a
 borrower,
 you


get
 to
 speak
 directly
 to
 your
 lender.


You
 get
 a
 customized
 solution.
 You
 get


speed,
 certainty
 of
 execution.
 If
 you're


an
 investor,
 you
 capture
 all
 of
 that


excess
 leakage
 in
 the
 form
 of
 higher


returns.
 And
 that's
 been
 the
 case
 for


the
 last
 20
 years.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 if


you're
 the
 financial
 markets,
 you
 have


an
 ecosystem
 that
 is
 less
 levered,
 more


asset
 liability
 management,
 brings
 more


financial
 stability
 to
 the
 overall


ecosystem.
 When
 you
 have
 something


that's
 really
 good
 for
 all
 market


participants,
 it
 tends
 to
 grow
 a
 lot
 and


that's
 what's
 happened
 in
 private


credit.


>> What
 is
 the
 equivalent
 of
 like
 in
 this


analogy
 which
 I
 really
 like,
 what
 is
 the


equivalent
 of
 the
 web,
 right?
 So
 the


reason
 Amazon
 could
 cut
 out
 the
 physical


bookstore
 or
 the
 various
 other
 retailers


etc
 is
 because
 the
 internet
 exists
 and


that
 create
 solves
 some
 information


problems
 etc.
 How
 would
 you
 describe
 the


sort
 of
 like
 the
 thing
 that
 exists
 now


such
 that
 so
 many
 different
 middlemen


and
 so
 forth
 can
 be
 cut
 out


>> scale.
 Okay.


>> Scale,
 right?
 The
 reason
 we
 couldn't
 do


what
 we
 do
 today


>> 20
 years
 ago


>> is
 cuz
 we
 didn't
 have
 the
 capital
 base.


We
 couldn't
 write
 a
 billion
 dollar
 plus


deal.
 Here's
 an
 interesting
 fact.
 Before


2021,
 there
 were
 only
 $5
 billion
 plus


private
 credit
 deals
 done
 ever.
 Since


2021,
 100
 plus,
 and
 we
 at
 Blackstone


have
 done
 most
 of
 them.
 So,
 what
 does


that
 mean?
 We
 have
 the
 scale
 of
 capital


to
 actually
 solve
 the
 problems
 for
 our


clients.
 we
 have
 the
 breath
 of
 team
 to


go
 out
 and
 cover
 the
 market
 and
 bring


these
 solutions
 direct
 to
 our
 borrowers.


And
 then
 the
 other
 thing
 that's
 happened


is
 the
 expansion
 of
 private
 credit


beyond
 what
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 think
 of
 it


as
 which
 is
 middle
 market
 sponsor
 back


direct
 lending
 into
 what
 we
 call
 the


real
 economy.
 Right?
 taking
 what
 is
 a$


two
 trillion
 dollar
 market
 today
 and


thinking
 about
 a
 30
 plus
 trillion
 dollar


addressable
 market
 when
 you
 think
 about


areas
 like
 private
 investment
 grade
 real


assets
 assetbacked
 finance
 and
 so
 the


other
 big
 piece
 of
 this
 is
 just
 the


massive
 expansion
 in
 the
 addressable


market
 that's
 come
 about


>> so
 I
 take
 the
 point
 about
 you
 know


customized
 financing
 solutions
 and


bringing
 investors
 closer
 to
 capital
 and


all
 of
 that
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 like


the
 concern
 is
 that
 as
 the
 base
 grows,


competition
 for
 deals
 increases
 and


that's
 when
 you
 start
 to
 see
 not
 just


potentially
 lower
 spreads
 but
 also
 more


leverage
 and
 we
 have
 seen
 you
 know
 some


first
 leans
 that
 are
 now
 uni
 trenches


and
 things
 that
 would
 normally
 spark
 a


little
 bit
 of
 worry.
 Is
 that
 something


that
 you're
 seeing
 in
 the
 market?


>> Well,
 it's
 funny.
 Look,
 I've
 been
 doing


private
 credit
 for
 two
 decades.
 I
 think


back
 to
 the
 deals
 that
 we
 were
 first


doing
 in
 private
 credit
 20
 years
 ago
 and


I
 would
 tell
 you
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 a


single
 one
 of
 them
 would
 pass
 our


investment
 committee
 today.
 They
 were


small.
 They
 were
 cyclical.
 They
 were


basically
 the
 stuff
 the
 banks
 wouldn't


do.
 Fast
 forward
 to
 today.
 Think
 about


the
 average
 direct
 lending
 deal
 we
 do.


It's
 a
 $200
 million
 EBIT
 business.
 It's


40%
 loan
 to
 value.
 PreGf
 loan
 to
 values


on
 deals
 were
 65%
 plus.
 And
 so
 when
 I


think
 about
 the
 risk
 posture
 of
 a
 senior


secured
 loan
 today,
 it
 feels
 pretty
 good


relative
 to
 history.
 And
 then
 that
 needs


to
 be
 combined
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 this


opportunity
 in
 investment
 grade
 private


credit
 I
 would
 say
 is
 the
 fastest


growing
 opportunity
 we
 see
 in
 credit
 at


Blackstone.


>> Right?
 So
 this
 is
 the
 other
 new
 thing


that's
 happening
 is
 uh
 IG
 private


credit.
 So,
 you
 know,
 private
 credit


extended
 to
 companies
 with
 very
 good


balance
 sheets,
 not
 junk
 rated,
 uh,
 has


become
 more
 of
 a
 thing.
 It's
 going


mainstream
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 is
 driven


by
 AI
 issuance
 and
 techreated
 issuance.


Talk
 more
 about
 what
 you're
 seeing
 in


that
 space.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 big
 part
 of
 it,


right?
 Anytime
 you
 see
 a
 significant


need
 for
 capital
 which
 we
 obviously
 see


in
 the
 data
 center
 buildout
 and
 then


connected
 to
 that
 all
 the
 energy
 power


and
 infrastructure
 that
 needs
 to
 uh


accompany
 that.
 You
 see
 huge
 capital


needs
 and
 markets
 that
 need
 that
 much


capital
 need
 to
 access
 all
 available


options
 and
 that
 includes
 public
 credit


but
 that
 also
 includes
 private
 credit.


Morgan
 Stanley
 put
 out
 a
 piece
 late
 last


year
 that
 estimated
 that
 $800
 billion
 of


private
 credit
 alone
 is
 needed
 to


finance
 the
 digital
 infrastructure
 build


out
 over
 the
 next
 5
 years.
 Okay,
 so


that's
 a
 massive
 number.
 I
 think
 what


gets
 missed
 when
 people
 think
 about
 the


financing
 element
 of
 financing
 a
 data


center
 for
 example
 is
 we're
 financing
 15


20-year
 takeerpay
 contracts


with


>> take
 pay
 contract


>> meaning
 think
 about
 a
 triple
 net
 lease


contract.
 No matter
 what
 your
 usage
 is,


no
 matter
 what
 your
 operating
 costs
 are,


you're
 getting
 a
 fixed
 sum
 every
 single


month
 from
 your
 tenant
 and
 they
 can't


get
 out
 of
 that
 contract.
 Okay?
 And


you're
 getting
 that
 from
 some
 of
 the


highest
 quality
 credit
 counterparties
 in


the
 world,
 right?
 Hyperscalers
 are
 the


tenants
 in
 most
 of
 the
 data
 centers


today.
 And
 so
 as
 I
 sit
 with
 my
 credit


hat
 on,
 if
 I
 can
 lend
 against
 some
 of


the
 best
 counterparties
 in
 the
 world


against
 a
 known
 defined
 stream
 of
 cash


flows
 and
 I
 can
 do
 that
 with
 150
 to
 200


basis
 points
 of
 excess
 spread
 versus


like
 rated
 public
 credit.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 sorry,
 explain
 that.
 So,
 we


the
 uh
 most
 creditworthy
 companies
 in


the
 worlds
 are
 these
 cash
 flow
 gushers,


the
 big
 tech
 companies,
 etc.
 What
 is
 the


I
 still
 don't
 quite
 get
 what
 is
 the


advantage
 for
 them
 of
 the
 private
 credit


market
 spreads
 as
 you
 mentioned
 are


wider.
 They
 can
 access
 the
 bond
 market.


They
 do
 it
 all
 the
 time
 or
 they


certainly
 can.
 So
 what
 is
 the
 what
 does


private
 credit
 solve
 for
 the
 meadows
 of


the
 world
 and
 the
 apples
 of
 the
 world


such
 that
 they
 can't
 borrow
 um
 versus


the
 public
 credit
 market?
 Customization,


okay,
 speed,


>> certainty,
 flexibility,
 bringing
 that


solution
 direct
 to
 the
 borrower.


Sometimes
 there's
 certain
 elements
 in


terms
 of
 the
 timing
 or
 whatever
 the
 case


may
 be
 that
 requires
 a
 private
 solution,


confidentiality.


>> Can
 you
 just
 explain
 that
 a
 little


further?
 Like
 what
 is
 it
 about
 these


projects
 specifically
 when
 you
 say
 like


customization?
 People
 say
 customization


all
 the
 time.
 Give
 us
 a
 specific


example.


>> Okay.
 Well,
 sometimes
 there's
 a


construction
 element.
 Okay.
 So,
 you
 need


to
 fund
 over
 time
 as
 opposed
 to
 funding


all
 of
 your
 capital
 day
 one.
 That's
 a


good
 example,
 right?
 Sometimes
 you
 need


to
 structure
 in
 a
 certain
 way
 um
 in


terms
 of
 the
 timing
 of
 the
 cash
 flows.


That's
 another
 example.
 So
 there
 are


things
 that
 are
 needed
 that
 don't


necessarily
 increase
 credit
 risk,
 but


they
 don't
 fit
 the
 cookie
 cutter
 mold
 of


a
 straight
 away
 investment
 grade
 public


bond.


So
 this
 might
 be
 a
 difficult
 question
 to


answer,
 but
 when
 you
 look
 at
 your
 own


portfolio,
 your
 own
 very
 large


portfolio,
 can
 you
 give
 like
 a
 rough


estimate
 of
 how
 much
 AI
 exposure
 has


increased
 over
 the
 years?


>> Well,
 that's
 a
 fascinating
 question,


right?
 Because
 um
 I
 tend
 to
 think
 about


AI
 exposure
 pretty
 broadly,
 right?
 cuz
 I


think
 AI
 will
 impact
 not
 just
 data


centers
 and
 the
 direct
 um
 you
 know
 um


first
 derivative
 impact
 but
 the
 second


derivative
 impact
 the
 third
 derivative


impact.


>> So
 you're
 looking
 at
 companies
 that


could
 be
 disrupted
 as
 well.
 We're


looking
 at
 it
 all
 and
 we
 have
 been


looking
 at
 it
 all
 and
 this
 is
 this
 is


part
 of
 working
 at
 Blackstone,
 right?


Like
 we
 have
 unbelievable
 insights
 into


what's
 going
 on
 all
 around
 the
 globe
 in


all
 of
 these
 markets,
 not
 just
 within


our
 credit
 business
 that
 has
 5,000
 plus


borrowers,
 but
 our
 private
 equity


business,
 our
 infrastructure
 business,


our
 real
 estate
 business.
 We
 happen
 to


own
 a
 couple
 of
 the
 largest
 data
 center


developers
 in
 the
 world.
 We
 have
 a
 huge


operating
 team
 that
 helps
 companies


implement
 uh
 AI
 capabilities,
 help
 them


play
 offense
 and
 defense
 when
 needed.


And
 so
 we
 leverage
 all
 of
 these
 res


resources
 and
 I
 think
 about
 AI
 impact


across
 almost
 every
 business
 in
 our


portfolio
 to
 varying
 degrees.
 But
 I


think
 you
 have
 to
 be
 front-footed
 in


thinking
 about
 that
 as
 an
 investor.


>> What
 about
 direct
 exposure
 to
 let's


forget
 about
 second
 derivatives.


>> I
 take
 the
 point
 but
 like
 the
 reason
 I'm


asking
 is
 because
 there
 are
 some


concerns
 around
 concentration
 limits
 at


places
 like
 insurers.


>> Yeah.
 Look,
 we
 have
 over
 $500
 billion


dollar
 of
 assets
 uh
 and
 credit
 at


Blackstone
 and
 I
 would
 tell
 you
 like
 the


the
 amount
 of
 direct
 data
 center


exposure
 is
 is
 a
 small
 minority
 of
 that.


It
 would
 not
 rise
 to
 the
 level
 of


something
 where
 any
 of
 our
 clients
 would


feel
 like
 they
 have
 concentration.
 What


about
 in
 terms
 of
 setting
 aside
 like


formal
 concentration
 limits
 just
 in


terms
 of
 like
 on
 a
 day-to-day
 business


right
 now
 or
 over
 the
 last
 year
 how
 much


of
 new
 new
 activity
 would
 you
 say
 is


related
 to
 either
 sort
 of
 data
 centers


or
 maybe
 some
 of
 the
 power
 uh
 yeah
 the


power
 financing
 that
 is
 also
 needed
 for


data
 centers.
 Look,
 um
 I
 would
 tell
 you


it's
 a
 material
 portion
 of
 what
 we're


doing
 because
 it
 is
 such
 a
 capital


intensive.


>> Yeah.


>> Credit
 intensive
 part
 of
 the
 market.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 when
 I
 think
 about
 everything
 we're


doing
 across
 our
 business
 and
 credit,
 it


doesn't
 it
 doesn't
 screen
 as
 something


that's,
 you
 know,
 significantly


overweight.
 Like
 if
 I
 think
 about
 what


we're
 doing
 in
 our
 private
 investment


grade
 business,
 that's
 a
 real
 asset


strategy
 broadly
 defined,
 right?
 That


includes
 obviously
 digital


infrastructure.
 It
 includes
 energy
 and


power,
 but
 it
 includes
 residential


mortgages,
 which
 is
 a
 massive
 asset


class.
 It
 includes
 equipment
 finance.
 We


just
 announced
 a
 deal
 recently
 um
 to
 do


to
 do
 an
 aircraft
 engine
 partnership.


And
 frankly,
 I'd
 say
 the
 single
 biggest


thing
 that
 it
 includes
 is
 what
 we
 call


corporate
 solutions.
 And
 these
 are


largecale
 customized
 private
 credit


partnerships


with
 public
 investment
 grade
 companies.


And
 so
 recently
 we
 did
 a
 deal
 with


Rogers
 up
 in
 Canada
 where
 we
 did
 a
 $5


billion
 financing
 for
 them
 against
 their


network
 infrastructure
 back
 hall.
 We


then
 did
 a
 deal
 late
 last
 year
 with


Serra
 Infrastructure
 to
 help
 them
 build


out
 an
 LNG
 project.
 And
 we're
 seeing


that
 not
 just
 in
 the
 US,
 we're
 seeing


that
 globally.
 We
 announced
 a
 deal


yesterday
 in
 fact
 with
 Ahold,
 the
 the


European
 supermarket
 company
 to
 help


expand
 their
 logistics
 footprint.
 And
 so


I
 would
 tell
 you
 the
 biggest
 theme
 I
 see


across
 our
 private
 investment
 grade


business
 is
 this
 notion
 of
 what
 we
 call


corporate
 solutions.


>> Um
 what's
 it
 like
 sourcing
 deals
 at
 the


moment?
 So
 Blackstone
 obviously
 very


big.
 So
 I
 imagine
 people
 are
 coming
 to


you
 constantly
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 one


of
 the
 things
 we
 heard
 when
 the
 private


credit
 market
 was
 very
 very
 hot
 was


>> there's
 a
 lot
 of
 competition
 for
 deals


right
 and
 everyone
 wants
 um
 in
 on


certain
 financing
 transactions.
 So


what's
 it
 like?
 You
 got
 to
 take
 it


market
 by
 market,
 right?
 We
 were
 just


talking
 about
 private
 investment
 grade


corporate
 solutions,
 some
 of
 these
 big


infrastructure
 credit
 areas.
 I
 would


tell
 you
 in
 that
 market


there
 is
 more
 demand
 for
 capital
 than


there
 are
 players
 like
 Blackstone
 with


the
 scale
 to
 actually
 meet
 those
 needs.


And
 so
 that
 is
 a
 market
 where
 I
 would


tell
 you
 we
 have
 robust
 deal
 activity


and
 that
 is
 a
 market
 where
 I
 see
 a
 lot


of
 excess
 spread.
 I
 know
 you
 mentioned


earlier
 that
 spreads
 are
 tight.
 That's


an
 area
 where
 I
 would
 say
 spreads
 are


actually
 quite
 attractive,
 right?
 If
 you


think
 about
 public
 IG
 spreads
 today
 are


80
 basis
 points.
 If
 you
 can
 make
 250


basis
 points
 in
 like
 forl
 like
 credit


rated
 risk
 like
 that's
 a
 lot
 of
 relative


excess
 spread
 and
 that's
 happening


because
 the
 demand
 for
 capital
 relative


to
 the
 supply
 of
 capital
 is
 quite


attractive
 and
 that's
 showing
 up
 for
 us


as
 lenders.
 I'd
 say
 in
 the
 direct


lending
 market
 um
 that's
 a
 market
 where


spreads
 have
 tightened
 in
 sympathy
 with


the
 liquid
 subinvestment
 grade
 markets


but
 the
 excess
 spread
 remains
 right
 that


excess
 spread
 of
 a
 couple
 hundred
 basis


points
 persists
 I
 think
 what
 is
 helping


is
 you
 are
 seeing
 this
 increase
 in
 deal


activity
 we
 saw
 very
 strong
 M&A
 activity


in
 the
 back
 half
 of
 last
 year
 if
 I
 look


at
 our
 Q4
 pipeline
 it's
 actually
 up
 25%


versus
 what
 it
 was
 at
 this
 time
 last


year
 and
 I
 think
 we
 are
 optimistic
 about


a
 strong
 recovery
 in
 deal
 activity
 that


will
 help
 on
 your
 point
 in
 terms
 of


sourcing
 deals
 in
 that
 market


specifically.
 I
 think
 the
 other
 thing


that's
 really
 important
 and
 and
 you


asked
 this
 question
 around
 how
 do
 we


scale
 a
 business
 part
 of
 it
 is
 not
 just


waiting
 and
 sitting
 for
 the
 phone
 to


ring.
 A
 huge
 part
 of
 what
 we
 do
 is
 think


about
 the
 thematic
 areas
 within
 all
 of


Blackstone,
 not
 just
 credit
 that
 we
 want


to
 deploy
 capital
 in
 and
 digital
 infra


energy
 and
 power.
 Those
 are
 good


examples
 in
 the
 investment
 grade
 space,


but
 there
 are
 also
 advance
 examples
 in


the
 subinvestment
 grade
 space.
 Life


sciences,
 utility
 services.
 And
 what
 our


team
 does
 is
 we
 proactively
 identify


these
 companies
 and
 pitch
 them


customized
 solutions.
 And
 because
 we


have
 the
 scale
 of
 capital
 to
 actually


solve
 that
 problem,
 we
 can
 do
 that.
 We


did
 a
 deal
 late
 last
 year
 with
 a
 company


called
 Signant
 Health
 in
 the
 life


sciences
 space,
 a
 billion-dollar
 plus


transaction
 that
 we
 led.
 How
 did
 we
 do


that?
 Well,
 we
 had
 financed
 their
 number


one
 competitor.
 We
 had
 followed
 this


loan
 because
 we
 had
 held
 it
 in
 our


liquid
 book.
 And
 so,
 we
 had
 the
 idea,


hey,
 let's
 call
 this
 company
 and
 say,


you
 should
 do
 a
 private
 loan.
 And
 that's


where
 the
 idea
 Asian
 comes.
 And
 that's


where
 the
 differentiation
 in
 the
 market


comes.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 can
 pick
 up
 the


phone.


>> Not
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 can
 create
 their
 own


ideas
 and
 actually
 affectuate
 them.
 And


I
 think
 that's
 something
 we're
 uniquely


good
 at.
 everything
 is
 just
 sort
 of
 like


scale
 and
 power
 laws
 and
 compounding


return
 from
 having
 grown
 and
 having
 ha


having
 that
 network
 the
 big
 get
 bigger


it's
 really
 such
 an
 extraordinary
 thing


and
 we
 see
 it
 in
 tech
 but
 we
 also


clearly
 see
 it
 in
 finance
 I
 think
 with


like
 you
 know
 the
 percentage
 of
 market


share
 that
 acrru
 to
 the
 biggest
 players


um
 clearly
 an
 advantage
 obviously
 want


to
 talk
 more
 about
 the
 industry
 overall


going
 back
 to
 you
 know
 Tracy
 mentioned


that
 we're
 so
 it's
 so
 over
 we're
 so
 back


or
 so
 or
 so
 cycle.
 So
 at
 the
 end
 of
 last


year


>> there
 were
 two
 things


>> um
 there
 were
 like
 two
 like
 kind
 of


blowups
 um
 in
 but
 both
 were
 both
 related


to
 autos.
 So
 uh
 treellor
 I
 don't
 know
 if


I'm
 pronouncing
 triricor


>> that's
 one
 of
 those
 words
 where
 I
 feel


like
 very
 stupid
 pronouncing
 it
 the


right
 way.


>> Yeah
 I
 do
 too.


And
 I'm
 like,
 should
 I
 just
 sayricolor


like
 I
 don't
 So
 there
 was
 a
 precolor
 and


then
 first
 brands
 which
 I'm
 pretty
 sure


I'm
 pronouncing
 correctly.
 And
 then


there
 was
 like
 so
 that
 was
 like
 in
 the


auto
 space
 and
 then
 there
 was
 all
 the


stuff
 that
 went
 viral
 for
 about
 5


minutes.
 There
 was
 something
 about
 the


chips
 and
 maybe
 they're
 going
 to


depreciate
 faster
 than
 people
 expect
 and


a
 bunch
 of
 people
 are
 going to
 be


holding
 the
 bag
 and
 I
 racket
 that
 out


aside.


>> Okay.


>> You
 get
 those
 uh
 blowups
 and
 the
 auto


area.
 Jamie
 Diamond
 comes
 out
 with
 the


cockroaches.
 What
 was
 your
 read
 on
 that


moment?
 Was
 there
 reason
 to
 think
 that


there
 are
 more
 trol


out
 there?


>> I
 would
 tell
 you
 when
 all
 of
 that
 was


going
 down,
 we
 were
 scratching
 our


heads.
 And
 the
 biggest
 reason
 we
 were


scratching
 our
 heads
 were
 all
 of
 those


examples
 were
 bankled,
 bagg
 syndicated,


baggwritten
 deals
 that
 somehow
 got


confused
 with
 private
 credit.
 And
 this


is
 the
 biggest
 frustration
 for
 us


because
 we
 looked
 at
 those
 deals
 and
 we


said,
 "Hey,
 one
 of
 the
 advantages
 of


private
 credit
 is
 you
 can
 actually
 do


private
 level
 due
 diligence.
 You
 can
 get


access
 to
 management
 team.
 You
 can
 do


weeks
 of
 work.
 You
 can
 get
 private


access
 to
 information."
 And
 so
 one
 of


our
 observations
 there
 was
 there
 was


this
 misconception
 and
 that's
 why
 we


think
 it's
 so
 important
 to
 continue
 to


educate
 on
 the
 distinctions
 between


public
 credit
 and
 private
 credit
 and


those
 situations
 um
 were
 public
 credit.


I
 think
 the
 other
 thing
 that
 I
 think


people
 maybe
 maybe
 don't
 appreciate
 is


while
 private
 credit
 has
 gotten
 a
 lot
 of


attention
 recently,
 private
 credit's


been
 around
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 You
 can


look
 at
 20-year
 returns
 in
 private


credit
 and
 you
 can
 see
 that
 they've


outperformed
 liquid
 credit
 by
 several


hundred
 basis
 points
 over
 20
 years


through
 cycles.
 Also,
 you
 can
 look
 at


the
 fact
 that
 realized
 losses
 over
 that


20-year
 period
 for
 the
 industry
 have


been
 1%.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 we
 look
 to
 the


data,
 we
 look
 to
 the
 clarification,
 but


then
 I
 think
 the
 last
 thing
 that's
 also


important
 to
 highlight
 here
 is


defaults
 happen
 in
 sub
 investment
 grade


credit.
 And
 I
 think
 this
 is
 the
 other


thing
 that
 I
 think
 gets
 missed.
 People


see
 a
 headline
 about
 a
 credit
 issue.


>> We
 have
 thousands
 of
 credit
 in
 our


portfolios.


Some
 of
 them
 are
 going
 to
 have
 issues.


That
 is
 normal.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the


long-term
 default
 rate
 in
 the
 leverage


loan
 market,
 in
 the
 public
 high
 yield


market,
 it's
 3%.
 These
 things
 happen.
 We


account
 for
 them
 in
 our
 underwriting.
 We


account
 for
 them
 in
 how
 we
 mark
 our


portfolio.
 And
 most
 importantly,
 we
 have


the
 resources
 to
 deal
 with
 those


situations.
 We
 have
 operating
 people.


We've
 got
 a
 big
 workout
 team.
 And
 if
 we


do
 have
 challenges
 in
 our
 book,
 I
 think


to
 your
 point
 on
 scale,
 Joe,
 having
 the


strength
 of
 Blackstone,
 the
 resource
 and


intellectual
 capital
 of
 Blackstone
 to


actually
 support
 those
 companies
 and


drive
 good
 outcomes
 for
 our
 investors


over
 term,
 that's
 what
 matters.
 just
 uh


I
 take
 your
 point
 about
 the
 20-year


returns,
 but
 you
 know,
 20
 years
 ago,
 the


private
 credit
 industry
 barely
 existed,


right?
 And
 then
 we've
 basically
 had
 a


17-year
 bull
 market
 except
 for
 five


minutes
 in
 2020.
 Um
 a
 17-year
 bull


market
 in
 risk
 assets.
 So
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 crazy
 to
 say
 like
 yes
 the
 returns


they're
 real
 they
 deliver
 the
 defaults


are
 low
 defaults
 happen
 but
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 totally
 crazy
 to
 wonder
 if


you're
 a
 turning
 point
 because
 there's


to
 some
 extent
 you
 can
 only
 take
 a


20-year
 track
 record
 so
 far
 if
 17
 years


of
 them
 were
 in
 more
 or
 less
 a
 non-stop


bull
 market.


>> So
 here's
 what
 I
 see.
 First
 off,
 what
 I


think
 will
 happen
 in
 the
 market
 is
 that


you
 will
 continue
 to
 see
 private
 credit


grow
 and
 you
 will
 continue
 to
 see
 strong


private
 credit
 performance.
 That
 said,


you're
 right.
 If
 I
 look
 forward
 versus


looking
 back,
 I
 think
 you
 it's


reasonable
 to
 believe
 that
 you
 will
 see


more
 dispersion
 in
 the
 asset
 class.
 You


will
 see
 some
 players
 underperform.
 You


will
 see
 some
 players
 have
 higher


losses.
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 means
 the


entire
 asset
 class
 will
 face
 challenges


because
 the
 model
 like
 we
 started
 with


that
 Amazon
 analogy
 that
 still
 persists.


The
 excess
 spread
 versus
 liquid
 markets


that
 is
 durable.
 The
 way
 our
 clients


access
 private
 credit
 and
 all
 of
 these


new
 areas
 beyond
 direct
 lending,
 we're


at
 the
 very
 very
 beginning
 of
 that
 very


very
 long
 road.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 the


long-term
 thesis
 for
 private
 credit
 is


intact.
 By
 the
 way,
 you
 don't
 see


massive
 waves
 of
 defaults
 outside
 of


recessions.
 And
 it
 doesn't
 feel
 like
 to


me
 we're
 headed
 into
 a
 recession.
 When
 I


look
 at
 corporate
 um
 earnings
 growth,


when
 I
 look
 at
 where
 consumers
 are,
 when


I
 look
 at
 fiscal
 and
 monetary
 stimulus,


none
 of
 that
 points
 to
 recession
 to
 me.


And
 so
 when
 I
 look
 forward,
 I
 don't
 see


we
 I
 don't
 see
 this
 big
 turning
 point


for
 the
 industry.
 I
 see
 continued
 growth


in
 the
 industry.
 But
 what
 I
 do
 see


is
 more
 dispersion
 which
 is
 a
 good


thing.
 If
 you
 think
 about
 all


established
 asset
 classes,
 you
 have
 top


quartile
 managers
 and
 you
 have
 bottom


cortile
 managers.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 the


asset
 class
 will
 be
 a
 lot
 more
 about
 who


is
 better
 at
 originating
 deals,
 who
 is


better
 at
 managing
 challenges
 in
 their


portfolio,
 who
 has
 the
 broadest
 aperture


to
 identify
 areas
 within
 credit
 broadly


defined
 where
 clients
 can
 deploy
 where


there
 is
 excess
 spread,
 where
 there
 is


better
 risk
 adjusted
 returns.
 I
 think


that's
 the
 era
 we're
 heading
 into
 and
 I


would
 say
 we
 strongly
 embrace
 that
 era.


>> Okay.
 So
 you
 don't
 see
 lots
 of
 defaults


coming
 up,
 but
 what
 about
 liability


management
 exercises
 or
 just


restructuring
 debt?
 Because
 this
 is


something
 that
 comes
 up
 occasionally.
 If


you
 look
 at
 the
 default
 rate
 for
 private


credit,
 I
 think
 officially
 it's
 below
 2%


something
 like
 that.
 But
 if
 you
 add
 back


in
 the
 liability
 management
 exercises


that
 we've
 seen
 at
 places
 like
 First


Brands,
 um
 it
 goes
 higher.
 I
 think
 it


goes
 to
 like
 5%
 or
 something
 like
 that.


Would
 you
 expect
 more
 companies
 to
 be


restructuring
 debt
 as
 this
 dispersion


effect
 maybe
 feeds
 through?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 there's
 two
 pieces
 I
 want


to
 unpack
 there.
 One,
 this
 whole
 notion


of
 liability
 management.


>> It
 really
 is
 a
 public
 market
 phenomenon


and
 it
 exists
 in
 the
 public
 markets


because
 public
 credit
 documents
 are


really
 weak,
 right?
 It
 they
 don't
 have


the
 same
 covenant
 protections
 that
 you


have
 in
 private
 credit.
 And
 so,
 you
 can


have
 debt
 layered
 in
 front
 of
 you.
 You


can
 have
 collateral
 stripped.
 That's


what's
 happened
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 these


situations
 in
 the
 public
 markets.


Fortunately,
 in
 private
 credit,
 the


documents
 are
 more
 protective.
 And
 so,
 I


think
 you
 will
 see
 less
 of
 that


aggressive
 behavior
 in
 the
 private


credit
 markets
 certainly
 versus
 the


public
 credit
 markets.
 The
 second
 thing


I
 would
 say,
 Tracy,
 is
 um
 the
 default
 is


just
 the
 beginning.
 What
 really
 matters


to
 clients
 are
 losses,
 right?
 Because


the
 strength
 of
 a
 private
 credit


document
 allows
 you
 to
 get
 to
 a
 table


and
 negotiate
 with
 the
 owner
 for
 maybe


more
 equity.
 Sometimes
 we
 have
 to
 take


control
 of
 the
 company
 and
 we
 can
 use


all
 of
 the
 resources
 of
 Blackstone
 to


improve
 that
 company
 and
 actually


deliver
 a
 strong
 outcome
 for
 our


clients.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 those
 are
 the


two
 points
 I
 would
 focus
 on.
 Yes,
 you


will
 see
 defaults
 but
 the
 question
 is


over
 time
 what
 is
 the
 loss
 experience


for
 investors
 and
 that's
 something
 I


think
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 conviction
 in.


>> Okay.
 So
 the
 other
 thing
 besides
 the
 uh


first
 branch
 and
 first
 branch
 and
 trial


blowups
 was
 the


>> you
 just
 want
 to
 keep
 saying


>> I
 just
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 like
 10
 more


times
 um
 was
 this
 anxiety
 about
 you
 know


the
 quality
 of
 some
 of these
 data
 center


finding
 like
 oh
 are
 the
 chips
 going
 to


be
 as
 valuable
 as
 people
 think
 and
 um


you
 know
 actually
 I
 was
 just
 looking
 up


like
 um
 some
 of
 the
 credit
 default
 swaps


on
 Oracle
 actually
 uh
 basically


continuing
 to
 hit
 new
 highs
 coreweave


which
 is
 another
 one
 that
 people
 were


watching
 a
 lot
 that's
 actually
 come
 in
 a


bit
 So
 maybe
 I
 don't
 know
 people
 are


chilled
 out
 a
 little
 bit
 but
 from
 the
 um


capital
 provider
 the
 the
 the
 lenders


>> um
 what
 is
 the
 appetite
 right
 now
 for
 AI


or
 related
 infrastructure
 financing
 in


the
 wave
 of
 some
 of
 these
 hiccups
 and


what
 we
 see
 in
 like
 the
 CDS
 market
 for


what
 might
 be
 some
 proxies
 for
 this
 kind


of
 stuff.
 Look,
 I
 think
 the
 nature
 of


the
 risk
 matters,
 right?
 I
 don't
 want
 to


paint
 it
 with
 a
 broad
 brush
 cuz
 you
 hit


it.
 The
 type
 of
 collateral
 matters.
 Who


your
 counterparty
 matters
 for
 us.


Whether
 we're
 financing
 chips,
 we're


financing
 a
 data
 center,
 we
 don't
 want


to
 take
 residual
 value
 risk,
 right?
 I


don't
 view
 that
 as
 credit
 risk.
 So,
 if
 I


can
 invest
 in
 chips,
 if
 I
 can
 invest
 in


a
 data
 center
 that
 has
 investment
 grade


counterparty
 risk
 and
 my
 debt
 will
 fully


be
 repaid
 inside
 of
 that
 contractual


agreement,
 whether
 it's
 triple
 net
 or


whatever.
 Um,
 and
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 take


residual
 value
 risk.
 I
 don't
 care
 what


that
 data
 center
 is
 worth
 in
 year
 25.
 I


don't
 care
 what
 those
 chips
 are
 worth
 in


year
 7.
 That's
 really
 good
 risk.
 I
 think


when
 you
 confine
 it
 to
 that
 which
 is


what
 we
 are
 doing
 I
 think
 that's
 quite


attractive.
 Will
 folks
 take
 that
 next


layer
 of
 risk?
 They
 might,
 but
 you
 need


to
 make
 equity
 returns.
 any
 pullback


like
 in
 some
 of
 the
 you
 know
 the
 less


triple
 net
 whatever
 they
 like
 compare


say
 okay
 January
 2026
 versus
 January


2025
 any
 anxiety
 because
 we
 know
 that


there
 is
 incredible
 demand
 for
 the


buildout
 right
 it's
 this
 multi-year


multi-
 trillion
 dollar
 thing
 from
 your


perspective
 right
 now
 how
 uh
 strong
 is


the
 capital
 base
 for
 that
 buildout
 has


it
 changed
 at
 all


>> I
 think
 when
 you
 have
 the
 contractual


protections
 And
 I'm
 highlighting
 I
 think


the
 demand
 is
 there.
 Now


>> there
 been
 some
 change
 since
 2025.


>> I
 would
 tell
 you
 that
 because
 the
 demand


for
 capital
 is
 so
 significant
 and
 bigger


than
 the
 supply
 of
 available
 capital.


When
 you
 see
 that
 happen,
 you
 see


spreads
 tend
 to
 widen.
 That's
 a
 healthy


thing.
 That's
 a
 good
 thing
 for
 the


markets.
 And
 I
 think
 some
 of
 those
 deals


that
 don't
 have
 the
 protections
 that
 I


highlighted,
 they
 have
 a
 harder
 time


getting
 done
 in
 the
 credit
 markets.
 And


you
 see
 them
 get
 funded
 in
 the
 equity


markets.
 I
 think
 both
 of
 those
 things


are
 healthy.
 I
 think
 when
 I
 take
 a
 big


step
 back,


there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 chatter
 about
 this


market,
 but
 we
 are
 firm
 believers
 in
 the


impact
 of
 AI.
 Sure.
 And
 I
 think
 the


bigger
 risk
 is
 underestimating
 the


impact
 of
 it
 on
 your
 broader
 portfolio


like
 I
 was
 alluding
 to
 before.


>> Um,
 what
 was
 the
 fourth
 quarter
 actually


like
 for
 you
 and
 what
 sort
 of
 questions


were
 you
 getting
 from
 investors?
 Because


we
 know,
 you
 know,
 some
 other
 private


credit
 players
 like
 Blue
 Owl
 got
 a
 bunch


of
 redemptions.
 Um,
 did
 you
 see
 similar


pressures?
 Look,
 anytime
 you
 tend
 to
 see


um
 some
 of the
 press
 that
 you


highlighted,
 it's
 natural
 to
 get


questions
 and
 we
 embrace
 those
 questions


and
 we
 address
 them
 with
 the
 facts
 that


I
 just
 highlighted.
 I
 think
 for
 us,
 we


continue
 to
 see
 very
 strong
 demand
 for


credit.
 I
 was
 around
 the
 world
 I
 think


twice
 in
 the
 fourth
 quarter
 meeting
 with


um
 our
 clients
 around
 the
 world
 and
 I


would
 tell
 you
 in
 aggregate
 they
 want


more
 private
 credit,
 right?
 our


institutional
 clients.
 I
 think
 year-to-


date
 through
 9:30
 inflows
 were
 up
 over


50%
 versus
 where
 they
 were
 a
 year
 prior.


We
 held
 a
 forum
 with
 many
 of
 our
 big


clients
 um
 late
 last
 year
 to
 discuss


relative
 value
 and
 risks
 in
 the
 credit


market.
 And
 actually,
 it
 was
 great
 for


me
 because
 it
 was
 a
 way
 I
 could
 actually


survey
 our
 clients
 on
 their
 views.
 And
 I


would
 tell
 you
 they
 continue
 to
 be
 very


bullish
 on
 private
 credit.
 If
 anything,


they
 feel
 underallocated
 to
 private


credit
 as
 an
 asset
 class.
 And
 so
 I
 think


the
 momentum
 will
 continue.


>> This
 sort
 of
 touches
 on
 one
 of
 my


favorite
 um
 things
 to
 talk
 about
 like


sort
 of
 portfolio
 construction,
 but
 for


these
 mega
 clients,


>> if
 they
 say,
 "Okay,
 we're
 underallocated


or
 we
 want
 more
 of
 this."
 What
 is
 it


that
 in
 their
 broad
 portfolio
 allocation


the
 characteristics
 of
 private
 credit


are
 solving
 for
 them
 right
 now?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 look,
 yield.


>> Okay.


>> Everyone
 loves
 yield,


>> right?
 Everybody
 loves
 yield.
 And
 I


think
 even
 with
 spreads
 tighter
 and
 with


rates
 coming
 off
 a
 little
 bit,
 even
 with


that,


>> the
 yield
 in
 credit
 relative
 to
 the


earnings
 yield
 of
 the
 S&P
 is
 as


attractive
 has
 been
 over
 a
 very
 long


period
 of
 time.
 So,
 credit
 remains


attractive.
 I
 think
 when
 valuations
 are


expensive
 like
 they
 are
 across
 the
 world


today
 in
 most
 asset
 classes,
 being


defensive
 at
 the
 top
 of
 the
 capital


structure
 really
 matters.


Diversification,
 right?
 Most
 of
 our


clients
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 credit
 risk,


corporate
 credit
 risk,
 excuse
 me,


corporate
 risk
 in
 their
 portfolios,


whether
 it's
 private
 equity
 or
 on
 the


credit
 side.
 What
 about
 real
 assets?


That's
 why
 assetback
 finance,
 that's
 why


investment
 grade
 have
 been
 so
 um


convincing
 for
 you
 know
 so
 high


conviction
 for
 our
 clients
 because
 it


offers
 that
 diversification.


It
 offers
 that
 access
 to
 real
 hard


assets
 that
 are
 downside
 protected


versus
 corporate
 risk.
 And
 then
 I
 would


say
 the
 other
 big
 theme
 for
 our
 clients


around
 the
 world
 is
 something
 we
 call


multi-asset
 credit.
 It
 is
 this
 notion


that
 credit
 as
 a
 whole
 is
 a
 place
 I
 want


to
 be
 deployed
 into.
 However,
 I'm
 also


recognizing
 the
 fact
 that
 markets
 eb
 and


flow.
 Where
 one
 market
 within
 credit
 is


attractive,
 one
 might
 be
 less


attractive.
 How
 do
 I
 partner
 with


someone
 like
 Blackstone
 across


everything
 we
 do
 over
 a
 dozen
 different


asset
 classes
 within
 credit
 to
 build
 a


diversified,
 resilient,
 higher
 yielding


portfolio
 that
 allows
 me
 to
 pivot
 to
 the


best
 opportunities
 in
 the
 market


wherever
 they
 may
 be?
 M
 um
 setting
 aside


some
 of
 the
 uh
 cockroach
 phenomenon
 of


late
 2025,
 there
 was
 another
 thing
 that


happened
 that
 was
 pretty
 big
 for
 the


credit
 market
 and
 that
 was
 the


withdrawal
 of
 the
 leverage
 lending


guidelines
 for
 banks.


>> Uh
 basically
 making
 it
 easier
 for
 them


to
 uh
 do
 broadly
 syndicated
 loans.
 Would


you
 expect
 that
 to
 increase
 competition


between
 the
 banks
 and
 the
 you
 know
 BDC's


so
 to
 speak?


>> Look,
 that
 one's
 gotten
 a
 lot
 of


attention
 and
 I've
 spoken
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 my


friends
 at
 the
 banks
 recently.
 I
 think


the
 reality
 is
 on
 new
 direct
 lending


deals,
 the
 market,
 and
 by
 the
 market,
 I


mean
 the
 private
 equity
 sponsors,


they've
 largely
 spoken,
 right?
 Like


speed,
 certainty,
 flexibility,


customization,
 all
 the
 stuff
 I
 hit
 on,


that's
 a
 really
 good
 thing
 for
 them,


especially
 when
 they're
 buying
 a
 company


and
 they're
 in
 a
 competitive
 auction


process.
 Even
 deals
 that
 met
 the


leverage
 loan
 lending
 guidelines
 that


were
 in
 place
 over
 the
 last
 two
 years,


85%
 of
 them
 were
 financed
 privately,


right?
 So
 even
 when
 you
 had
 complying


deals,
 they
 were
 borrowers
 were
 still


choosing
 private
 credit.
 I'd
 say
 today


our
 partnership
 opportunities
 with
 the


banks,
 particularly
 on
 the
 investment


grade
 side
 of
 what
 we
 do,


it
 is
 more
 uh
 it
 is
 bigger
 than
 anything


I
 would
 say
 that
 we've
 seen
 over
 the


last
 several
 years.
 The
 bank's
 desire
 to


partner
 with
 us
 where
 they
 keep
 the


client
 arrangement,
 they
 keep
 the


servicing,
 we
 keep
 the
 asset.
 We
 are


seeing
 that
 as
 a
 global
 dynamic


especially
 around
 some
 of
 these
 longer


duration
 asset
 classes,
 these
 hard
 asset


asset
 classes
 and
 those
 are
 the
 exact


things
 that
 our
 our
 investors
 want
 and


so
 I
 think
 that
 partnership
 opportunity


um
 will
 continue
 to
 grow.


>> This
 is
 the
 friendmy
 dynamic
 that
 we've


spoken
 about
 before
 right
 so
 private


lenders
 are
 in
 competition
 with
 the


public
 lenders
 the
 banks
 but
 at
 the
 same


time
 we're
 seeing
 more
 partnerships.
 No,


and
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 intu
 intuitive


there
 about,
 you
 know,
 wanting
 to
 keep


that
 relationship,
 but
 also
 this
 element


of
 like,
 okay,
 the
 speed
 and


customization,
 the
 financing.
 I
 have
 a


question
 actually
 about
 management,


internal
 management
 and
 the
 art
 of


growing
 a
 business.
 You
 mentioned
 being


proactive.
 So,
 you're
 going
 to
 have


people
 on
 the
 phone
 and
 they're
 like,
 we


did
 this
 thing.
 Would
 you
 be
 interested


in
 this
 solution?
 And
 so
 forth.
 You
 have


this
 big
 company.
 You're
 building
 it


over
 time.
 I'm
 curious
 like
 how
 do
 you


design
 a
 system
 such
 that
 you
 have
 lots


of
 people
 working
 the
 phones
 but
 um


wanting
 to
 grow
 their
 own
 books
 but
 not


lower
 standards
 and
 let
 garbage
 into
 it


and
 how
 do
 you
 think
 like
 how
 do
 you


build
 those
 systems
 into
 it
 so
 that
 the


person
 on
 the
 phone
 isn't
 you
 know
 yeah


bringing
 in
 a
 bunch
 of
 garbage
 just
 to


grow
 volume


>> I
 love
 this
 question
 so
 um
 as
 I
 think


back
 at
 the
 history
 of
 our
 business
 at


blastoning
 credit
 obviously
 we've
 seen


tremendous
 growth
 we've
 seen
 tremendous


success.
 Um,
 a
 big
 turning
 point
 for
 me


personally
 was
 co
 because
 up
 until
 that


point
 in
 time,
 we
 ran
 each
 of
 our


businesses
 almost
 as
 verticals,
 right?


We
 whether
 it
 was
 direct
 lending
 or


asset
 back
 finance
 or
 liquid
 credit,
 we


had
 PMs
 in
 each
 of
 those
 businesses
 and


they
 ran
 each
 of
 their
 businesses
 from


raising
 the
 capital
 to
 investing
 the


capital
 to
 manage
 the
 team
 almost
 as
 a


vertical
 entity.


>> We
 had
 no
 horizontal
 layer.
 But
 what
 co


taught
 us
 when
 we
 were
 all
 at
 home
 in


our
 pajamas
 and
 the
 markets
 were
 going


wonky
 that
 we
 needed
 that
 connectivity.


It
 would
 be
 really
 valuable
 if
 one
 piece


of
 our
 business
 was
 really
 connected


with
 the
 other
 piece
 of
 our
 business.


And
 so
 we
 started
 building
 out
 our
 CIO


office
 which
 I
 lead
 as
 a
 horizontal


layer
 to
 connect
 all
 of
 the
 dots
 and


bring
 tremendous
 consistency
 across
 our


teams.
 And
 5
 years
 on
 that
 team
 is
 now


120
 plus
 people.
 And
 what
 that
 team
 does


day
 in
 day
 out
 is
 unifying
 the
 fabric
 of


every
 single
 one
 of
 our
 investment


businesses.
 And
 so
 we
 have
 a
 single


investment
 committee
 that
 whether
 you


are
 a
 direct
 lending
 deal
 or
 an
 asset


back
 deal
 or
 a
 liquid
 deal,
 you
 go
 to


that
 same
 investment
 committee,
 same


underwriting
 standards,
 same
 memo,
 but


most
 importantly
 the
 same
 people
 hearing


the
 deals
 from
 all
 the
 different
 parts


of
 the
 Blackstone
 credit
 ecosystem
 to


know
 where
 are
 the
 best
 opportunities.


By
 the
 way,
 that
 investment
 committee


also
 includes
 senior
 representatives
 of


Blackstone
 outside
 of
 credit.
 What
 are


we
 learning
 in
 private
 equity?
 What
 are


we
 learning
 in
 infrastructure
 that
 might


influence
 this
 decision?
 The
 way
 we


aggregate
 and
 monitor
 data,
 we
 now
 have


one
 centralized
 portfolio
 company


reporting
 system.
 And
 so
 anytime
 we
 see


weaknesses
 in
 an
 area,
 instantly
 the


entire
 team
 knows
 that
 and
 say,
 "Okay,


let's
 pull
 back
 origination
 in
 this


sector
 and
 let's
 lean
 into
 origination


in
 this
 other
 sector."
 And
 so


systemizing
 our
 data,
 centralizing
 our


processes,
 being
 even
 more
 plugged
 into


the
 themes
 we
 see
 more
 broadly
 at


Blackstone,
 that
 has
 been
 a
 critical


part
 of
 our
 journey
 and
 I
 think
 a
 huge


competitive
 advantage
 for
 us
 going


forward.


>> I
 just
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 where
 we


started
 the
 conversation
 and
 I
 mean


really
 the
 beginning
 of
 the


conversation,
 your
 job
 title.
 So
 CIO
 for


Blackstone
 Credit
 and
 insurance.
 I
 think


this
 is
 really
 important
 and


underappreciated
 in
 many
 ways,
 but
 the


partnership
 between
 insurers
 and
 private


credit
 has
 been
 phenomenal.
 Like
 a
 lot


of
 the
 private
 credit
 growth
 that
 we
 are


seeing
 is
 coming
 directly
 from
 insurers.


How
 important
 is
 it
 to
 I
 guess
 be
 an


insurance
 company
 if
 you're
 in
 the


private
 credit
 space
 or
 have
 access
 to


that
 pool
 of
 capital?


>> Sure.
 Well,
 couple
 points
 I
 want
 to


really
 hit
 here.
 Um,
 one
 is
 our
 business


model
 in
 insurance
 because
 it
 is


different
 than
 some
 others,
 right?
 We


don't
 have
 a
 captive
 insurance
 balance


sheet.
 We
 don't
 originate
 insurance


liabilities
 directly
 at
 Blackstone.
 All


we
 do
 is
 act
 as
 a
 third-party
 asset


manager
 on
 behalf
 of
 insurance
 clients.


That's
 what
 we
 do
 best.
 That's
 all
 we


want
 to
 do.
 Brick
 by
 brick.
 We've
 built


our
 client
 base.
 It's
 a
 fully
 open


architecture
 model.
 All
 of
 our
 clients


sit
 shoulder-to-shoulder.
 Um,
 and
 so
 I


think
 that
 business
 model
 is
 critical,


right?
 We
 don't
 want
 to
 compete
 with
 our


clients.
 Um,
 and
 we
 want
 to
 make
 sure


that
 every
 single
 one
 of
 them
 gets
 a


great
 experience
 with
 us.
 I
 think
 that's


a
 business
 model
 question.
 And
 I
 think


that's
 an
 important
 part
 of
 how
 we
 set


up
 that
 franchise.
 The
 second
 piece
 is


the
 why.
 Why
 are
 insurance
 companies


seeking
 private
 credit
 capital?
 Well,
 in


the
 case
 of
 a
 lifeur,
 you're
 writing
 a


40-year
 life
 insurance
 policy.
 In
 case


of
 writing
 an
 annuity,
 you're
 writing
 a


a
 set
 uh
 contract.
 Um
 the
 best
 way
 to


manage
 assets
 against
 those
 liabilities


are
 safe
 cash
 paying
 contractual
 assets.


Those
 assets
 are
 exactly
 what
 we


originate
 in
 private
 credit.
 And
 that


excess
 spread
 that
 we've
 been
 talking


about
 throughout
 this
 discussion,
 150
 to


200
 basis
 points
 for
 investment
 grade


like
 for
 like
 credit,
 that
 is


extraordinarily


valuable
 for
 insurance
 companies
 versus


just
 buying
 traditional
 liquids
 on
 the


screen.
 And
 we've
 seen
 US
 insurance


companies
 adopt
 that
 in
 scale
 with
 a
 ton


of
 success.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 big
 themes
 I


see
 going
 forward
 is
 that
 same
 idea


expanding
 to
 Europe,
 expanding
 to
 Asia


because
 it
 is
 such
 a
 strong
 fit
 for


insurance
 company
 balance
 sheets,


highquality,
 safe,
 contractual,


longduration
 investment
 grade
 assets.
 So


I've
 never
 worked
 in
 insurance
 or


private
 credit,
 but
 I've
 worked
 in
 the


media
 industry
 and
 the
 digital
 media


industry.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 phenomenons


that
 you
 see
 is
 company
 starts
 and
 they


buy
 various
 thirdparty
 solutions
 off
 the


shelf
 like
 oh
 I'm
 going to
 like
 buy
 a


piece
 of
 software
 to
 run
 my
 uh
 content


management
 system
 for
 the
 website.
 Then


you
 grow
 and
 then
 you
 grow
 and
 you're


like
 you
 know
 what
 this
 uh
 third
 party


solution
 doesn't
 work
 I
 need
 to
 build
 my


own
 software
 for
 managing
 my
 content


etc.
 Does
 what
 happens
 like
 do
 insurance


companies
 hit
 a
 point
 where
 it's
 like


you
 know what


>> we
 we we've
 enjoyed
 doing
 business
 with


you
 but
 we
 actually
 want
 to
 launch
 our


own
 private
 credit
 arm
 and
 we
 know
 that


there
 are
 some
 of
 course


>> I
 mean
 there
 are
 insurers
 who
 are
 joined


at
 the
 do
 all
 do
 they
 what
 is
 there
 a


point
 where
 it
 just
 makes
 sense
 for
 them


to
 like
 have
 their
 own
 private
 credit


shop
 or
 is
 it
 sort
 of
 case
 by
 case


whether
 that
 makes
 sense
 for
 them?
 Well,


I
 think
 the
 direction
 of
 travel
 broadly


is
 the
 other
 way,
 right?
 The
 reason
 why


our
 business
 has
 grown
 so
 much
 is


because
 insurance
 companies
 have
 said,


"Hey,
 Blackstoneone,
 you're
 really
 good


at
 this.
 You've
 got
 a
 huge
 dedicated


team.
 You've
 got
 tons
 of
 expertise.
 We


can't
 replicate
 it."
 But
 that
 is
 company


by
 company
 and
 some
 continue
 to
 do
 some


things
 in
 house.
 Some
 have
 certain


strategies
 where
 they
 have
 that


expertise
 and
 they'll
 continue
 to
 do


that
 in
 house
 and
 we're
 happy
 to


complement
 in
 the
 areas
 where
 we
 can
 be


editive.
 But
 I
 would
 say
 the
 overall


direction
 of
 travel
 is
 a
 realization


that
 we
 have
 built
 out
 this


infrastructure,
 this
 origination
 team,


this
 CIO
 portfolio
 man
 management


franchise,
 this
 allocate
 asset


allocation
 framework
 and
 clients
 want
 to


benefit
 from
 that.


>> Uh
 you've
 mentioned
 excess
 spreads


throughout
 this
 conversation
 and
 I
 take


the
 point
 that
 everything
 is
 relative.
 I


think
 I
 mentioned
 that
 in
 the
 intro,
 but


it
 is
 also
 true
 that
 spreads
 on
 direct


lending
 have
 fallen
 over
 the
 past
 year.


So,
 I
 think
 we
 went
 below
 10%
 for
 like


the
 first
 time
 in
 3
 years,
 something


like
 that.
 They
 used
 to
 be
 in
 the
 mid
 to


low
 teens.
 What
 do
 you
 see
 happening
 to


spreads
 next
 year
 or
 this
 year,
 I
 should


say,
 because
 it
 seems
 kind
 of
 concerning


to
 me
 if
 we're
 getting
 more
 supply,
 but


spreads
 are
 grinding
 tighter.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 look,
 I
 think
 there's
 a


couple
 of
 things
 there.
 First,
 you


mentioned
 it,
 right?
 Um,
 borrowers
 do


have
 choice,
 right?
 And
 so
 there
 is


going
 to
 be
 some
 connection
 to
 where
 the


liquid
 markets
 are
 and
 over
 time
 that


200
 basis
 point
 spread
 for
 privates


versus
 liquids
 has
 held
 and
 it
 holds


today.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 one
 thing


to
 watch
 and
 I
 think
 that
 relative
 value


point
 you
 made
 is
 the
 crit
 critical


point.
 I
 think
 the
 second
 thing
 is
 um


yes
 you
 are
 starting
 to
 see
 more
 M&A


supply
 but
 we're
 still
 well
 off
 where
 we


were
 5
 years
 ago.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 there's


still
 a
 lot
 more
 room
 to
 run.
 And
 when
 I


kind
 of
 step
 back
 and
 I
 look
 at
 the


simple
 math
 of
 private
 equity
 dry
 powder


versus
 private
 credit
 dry
 powder,


private
 equity
 dry
 powder
 outstrips
 it


five
 to
 one.
 Okay.
 And
 so
 I
 think


there's
 still
 a
 lot
 more
 room
 to
 run
 in


the
 supply
 equation.
 I
 think
 spreads


today
 are
 pretty
 stable.
 And
 I
 think
 our


clients
 earning
 that
 excess
 spread


versus
 liquids,
 earning
 that
 absolute


return,
 which
 still
 feels
 quite
 good


even
 though
 it's
 not
 the
 same
 as
 it
 was


3
 years
 ago
 still
 feels
 quite
 good


relative
 to
 where
 equities
 are
 valued


today
 and
 other
 things
 in
 their


portfolio.
 In
 private
 assets
 in
 general,


one
 of
 the
 popular
 critiques
 is
 that,


you
 know,
 people
 call
 volatility


laundering.
 It's
 like,
 oh,
 look,
 I
 had
 a


rough
 quarter
 in
 my
 in
 my
 stock


portfolio
 and
 my
 whatever,
 but
 my
 credit


portfolio
 is
 flat
 this
 quarter
 and


because
 there
 were
 no
 trades,
 there
 were


no
 marks
 and
 that
 makes
 me
 feel
 sleep


easier
 at
 night.
 And
 the
 the
 accusation


is
 is
 an
 industry
 built
 to
 some
 extent


on
 this
 notion
 of
 like
 here's
 this
 asset


class
 that
 just
 like
 helps
 me
 sleep


better
 at
 night,
 it
 doesn't
 doesn't


move,
 etc.
 What
 do
 you
 what's
 the


response
 to
 the
 volatility
 laundering


claim
 in
 in
 private
 assets
 generally?


>> Yeah,
 a
 couple
 things
 there.
 First,
 I


looked
 to
 a
 20-year
 loss
 ratio,
 right?


Like,
 you
 can't
 hide
 that
 over
 20
 years.


And
 I
 think
 those
 stats
 speak
 for


themselves.
 Second,
 you're
 right.
 Like,


this
 question
 around
 valuations
 have


have
 been
 out
 there
 in
 private
 assets.
 I


mean,
 Blast's
 been
 around
 for
 40
 years.


We
 use
 a
 best-in-class
 process
 with


third
 party
 valuation
 providers.
 We
 mark


our
 book
 every
 single
 quarter.
 Um,
 and


and
 those
 third
 parties
 are
 the
 ones


that
 are
 doing
 it.
 And
 we
 mark
 that
 to


market.
 company
 fundamentals,
 market


moves,
 that
 all
 shows
 up.
 What's
 funny


to
 me
 is,
 you
 know,
 when
 we
 do
 see


underperformance
 in
 an
 asset
 and
 we
 mark


it
 down,
 which
 we
 do
 on
 our
 watch
 list


assets,
 we
 get
 questions
 about
 that.


People
 are
 paying
 attention
 to
 that.


Yet,
 they
 are
 also
 asking
 us
 out
 of
 the


same
 breath,
 are
 you
 actually
 marking


your
 assets?
 And
 so,
 I
 think
 if
 you


actually
 look
 at
 our
 portfolio,
 you
 will


see
 a
 small
 subset
 of
 the
 book
 that


isn't
 doing
 what
 we
 expected
 to
 do,
 and


we
 mark
 those
 accordingly.
 I
 think


that's
 healthy.
 I
 think
 that's
 good.
 I


think
 that
 provides
 some
 buffer
 for
 our


clients
 and
 we'll
 continue
 to
 use
 our


third
 party
 wellestablished
 process
 to


continue
 to
 do
 so.


>> Uh
 you
 mentioned
 dry
 powder
 earlier
 and


this
 is
 a
 truism
 of
 markets
 which
 is
 dry


powder
 always
 seems
 to
 be
 waiting
 in
 the


wings
 like
 no
 matter
 where
 we
 are
 in
 the


credit
 cycle
 someone's
 talking
 about
 dry


powder.
 I'm
 sort
 of
 surprised
 to
 hear


that
 much
 the
 number
 you
 cited
 in
 the


private
 credit
 space
 because
 again
 like


we
 have
 seen
 phenomenal
 growth
 and


there's
 still
 cash
 lying
 around
 that


needs
 to
 be
 deployed.


>> Look,
 we
 continue
 to
 see
 strong
 flows


into
 the
 market,
 right?
 The
 product
 is


doing
 what
 it's
 supposed
 to
 do
 which
 is


generate
 strong
 consistent


outperformance
 for
 clients
 relative
 to


liquids.
 I
 think
 as
 long
 as
 you
 see
 that


continue,
 you're
 going
 to
 continue
 to


see
 strong
 flows
 across
 all
 of
 our


client
 types,
 whether
 it's
 insurance,


institutions,
 individuals.


uh
 question
 I
 ask
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 today


in
 January
 2026
 within
 your


organization.


Are
 you
 finding
 productive
 applications


of
 generative
 AI
 tools
 that
 make
 your


life
 easier
 and
 reduce
 uh
 free
 up


working
 hours
 from
 people
 who
 to
 do


other
 things?
 Yeah,
 look,
 this
 is
 a
 huge


focus
 for
 us
 and
 I
 think
 I
 would
 be


lying
 if
 I
 say
 we
 have
 the
 golden
 ticket


today,


>> but
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 focus
 on
 this
 area.


How
 do
 we
 make
 our
 business
 more


efficient?
 How
 do
 we
 make
 it
 easier
 on


our
 teams?
 Whether
 it's
 building
 models,


knowing
 what
 questions
 to
 ask
 in
 their


due
 diligence
 process,
 data
 aggregation


and
 analysis,
 all
 of
 this
 stuff
 is
 in


motion.
 It's
 at
 various
 stages
 of


development.
 Um,
 and
 I
 think
 you
 will


continue
 to
 see
 us
 lean
 into
 that


significantly.
 It
 can
 never
 replace
 the


investment
 decision,
 right?
 That's
 still


going
 to
 be
 central
 to
 our
 process.
 But


I
 think
 anytime
 we
 can
 use
 AI
 to
 drive


efficiency,
 and
 I
 like
 I
 said,
 we
 have


tools
 that
 allow
 that
 to
 like
 create
 the


start
 of
 an
 investment
 committee
 memo,


the
 start
 of
 a
 model,
 aggregate
 data
 so


we
 can
 help
 our
 team
 see
 trends
 earlier.


All
 of
 these
 things
 are
 in
 process
 and
 I


think
 more
 and
 more
 you'll
 see
 higher


adoption.


>> Could
 you
 imagine
 a
 future
 where


valuation
 is
 done
 more
 by
 AI?
 Because
 I


think
 about
 the
 third
 party
 valuation


services.
 They're
 doing
 matrix
 pricing


which
 is
 basically
 inferring
 the
 market


value
 from
 you
 know
 other
 clues
 they
 can


get.


>> Inference
 is
 like
 you
 know
 that's
 AI


basically.
 Look,
 I
 I
 think
 using
 AI
 to


support
 that
 process,
 you
 know,
 where


have
 market
 spreads
 moved?
 Okay,
 this


company's
 performance
 was
 X.
 How
 does


that
 translate
 into
 a
 mark?
 I
 think
 you


will
 see
 just
 like
 I
 I
 highlighted
 on


the
 investment
 process.
 I
 think
 you
 will


see
 adoption
 of
 support
 tools
 driving


efficiency,
 driving
 accuracy,
 driving


scale.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 you
 still


need
 a
 human
 at
 the
 end
 of
 that
 to
 make


the
 decision.
 Um,
 but
 I
 do
 think
 you'll


see
 it
 incorporated
 more
 and
 more
 into


our
 workflows.
 What
 skills
 are
 you


looking
 for
 when
 you
 think
 about


recruiting
 in
 2026
 and
 2027?


>> A
 lot
 of
 people
 anxious
 about
 what
 they


should
 what
 they
 should
 know,
 what
 they


should
 be
 studying,
 etc.
 What
 are
 the


skills
 that
 today
 are
 still
 clearly


valuable
 and
 will
 be
 valuable
 that
 you


would
 want
 to
 see
 in
 a
 new
 recruit?


Well,
 look,
 first
 and
 foremost,
 the


people
 we
 look
 to
 hire
 at
 Blackstone,


incredibly
 hardworking,
 genuinely
 good


people,


motivated
 by,
 you
 know,
 taking
 on
 more,


growing,
 some
 of
 these
 like
 fundamental


traits
 like


>> that
 is
 universal
 and
 I
 think
 that
 will


never
 change.


>> I
 think
 in
 an
 environment
 where
 you're


using
 more
 and
 more
 productivity
 tools,


>> how
 do
 you
 interact
 with
 people?
 People


want
 to,
 you
 know,
 do
 deals
 with
 folks


that
 they
 feel
 like
 they
 can
 trust.
 they


develop
 good
 relationships.
 How
 do
 you


think
 forward
 around
 corners?
 These
 are


the
 types
 of
 critical
 thinking
 and


communication
 skills
 that
 I
 think
 are


going
 to
 be
 even
 more
 valuable
 to
 layer


on
 to
 all
 like
 the
 basic
 stuff
 we
 have


always
 looked
 for
 in
 the
 people
 we
 bring


into
 the
 firm.


>> All
 right,
 Z,
 we're
 going to
 have
 to


leave
 it
 there,
 but
 thank
 you
 so
 much


for
 coming
 on
 all
 Thoughts.
 Really


appreciate
 it.


>> It
 was
 my
 absolute
 pleasure.
 Thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.
 That
 was
 a
 lot
 of


fun.
 I
 learned
 a
 lot.
 Thank
 you.


Joe,
 I'm
 a
 journalist
 or
 a
 podcast
 host.


Maybe
 there's
 a
 difference.


>> No,
 no,
 no.
 There's
 no
 no
 we're


journalists.
 People
 ask
 me
 at
 parties,


what
 do
 you
 do?
 I
 say
 I'm
 a
 journalist.


>> All right.
 All
 right.
 Uh
 the
 natural


tendencies
 of
 journalists
 is
 to
 uh
 be
 a


little
 bit
 more
 pessimistic
 than
 an


investor.
 I
 mean,
 if
 you're
 an
 investor,


almost
 by
 definition,
 you
 have
 to
 be


optimistic.


>> I
 agree.


>> A
 paranoid
 optimist.


>> That's
 right.
 But
 I
 do
 see
 some
 signs
 of


worry
 in
 the
 private
 credit
 market.
 So,


beyond
 the
 cockroaches
 um
 that
 we
 talked


about,
 you
 know,
 we
 have
 more
 companies


doing
 liability
 managements.
 The


documentation
 point
 I
 found
 kind
 of


surprising
 because
 in
 our
 previous


conversations
 and
 certainly
 in
 some
 of


the
 research
 that
 I
 see
 people
 say
 that


documentation
 is
 declining.
 So
 investor


protections
 are
 basically
 going
 down
 and


there's
 more
 convergence
 with
 the
 public


market
 and
 things
 like
 that.
 So,
 I
 I


take
 the
 point
 that
 like
 every
 private


credit
 investor
 that
 we
 have
 on
 this


show
 is
 going
 to
 say
 that
 they're


different
 and
 they're
 more
 selective
 and


things
 like
 that.
 And
 it
 may
 be
 true,


but
 overall,
 if
 you're
 seeing


documentation
 go
 down
 and
 leverage
 go
 up


and
 supply
 increasing,
 that
 seems
 kind


of
 bad.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 think
 the


thing
 that
 I
 I
 guess
 I
 mean,
 all
 of
 that


sounds
 very
 intuitive
 to
 me
 in
 these


tensions.
 The
 other
 thing
 that
 and
 it's


sort
 of
 related
 to
 this
 is
 like
 how
 do


you
 maintain
 like
 okay
 you
 think
 about


the
 fundamental
 service
 right
 you
 think


about
 the
 fundamental
 service
 of
 like


speed
 and
 custom
 customizability


and
 so
 forth


>> and
 then
 the
 tension
 that
 exists
 is
 like


okay
 you
 want
 to
 like
 turn
 this
 around


right
 away
 etc
 and
 the
 tension
 between


that
 and
 like
 robust
 documentations
 and


I
 mean
 again
 20-year
 to
 some
 extent


speaks
 for
 itself.
 But
 on
 the
 other


hand,
 like
 you
 could
 see
 how
 these


things
 over
 time
 would
 come
 into
 um


especially
 come
 into
 tension
 such
 a


competitive
 environment.
 Exactly.


>> I
 want
 to
 you
 know
 what
 you
 you
 place
 a


phone
 call
 to
 me
 because
 you
 need
 money.


I
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 give
 you
 an
 answer


right
 away.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 say
 yes
 very
 quickly.
 I


want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 say
 yes
 to
 you
 to


maintain
 your
 business,
 to
 maintain
 that


line
 and
 the
 tensions
 that
 could


potentially
 emerge
 between
 like
 our


relationship
 as
 the
 lender
 to
 the


borrower
 versus,
 you
 know,
 my


relationship
 to
 my
 uh
 people
 who
 want


protections,
 etc.
 You
 could
 see
 how


those
 uh
 would
 emerge
 for
 sure.


>> Yeah.
 All right.
 Shall
 we
 leave
 it


there?


>> Let's
 leave
 it
 there.


>> All right.
