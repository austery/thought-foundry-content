Humans have been using alcohol
for thousands of years.
But when did we understand it soberly?
It wasn't until the 1700s
that scientists first discovered
the formula of alcohol: C2H5OH.
That's alcohol,
finally got its professional
LinkedIn profile called ethanol,
and started working
as an important chemical.
Advances in engineering and business
have since enabled
large-scale production of ethanol,
and today it is a 
114 billion-dollar industry.
We use it in cosmetics,
in fashion, in medicine,
in food and obviously, beverages.
And it's even more relevant today as fuel
and raw material for some
of the low-carbon industries.
So why am I telling you about alcohol?
Because it is a good example
of how science, engineering and business
work together to change the world.
But it actually took ethanol
more than 200 years to do so.
We simply couldn't wait that long
to tackle our climate challenge.
We urgently need to speed up
and scale up low-carbon solutions.
So my name is Xu Hao and I lead
Tencent's climate change initiatives.
We're a major Chinese tech company
with products in social media,
video games and cloud services.
And we also care about climate change.
It's not just limited
to data center efficiency
or sourcing of renewable energy,
as important as that is.
My colleagues and I have been working
to explore how we could contribute
to the acceleration
of low-carbon technology innovations.
That's why we launched CarbonX Program.
And three years in,
we are actually more optimistic than ever.
Why?
Because we felt the right
answer is not so complicated.
We already have lots of innovation
in science, in engineering and business,
and the secret to further
accelerate the process
is also simple: just do them all at once.
Let me further explain.
First, most of the scientific discoveries
needed to decarbonize our economy
have already been made.
Really, today we generate
electricity from solar and wind,
we store energy
using chemistry or physics.
We turn carbon dioxide
into all kinds of chemicals.
And nuclear fusion is also on the horizon.
Alright, 100 years already saved.
Let me give you a specific example.
CRISPR is a genetic scissor
that's well-known
in the pharmaceutical industry.
They use it to edit genetic code
to find cures for diseases and new drugs.
But it can be applied to carbon too.
Take Gasgene, a Chinese startup.
They actually apply CRISPR
to a certain bacteria called Clostridium,
so that these little guys
can actually feed on carbon dioxide
and produce butanol.
So why does butanol matter?
Because together with our old
friend ethanol as well as butanol,
we actually get ethylene glycol,
polyethylene, polypropylene,
butyl acetate,
dibutyl phthalate,
tributyl citrate and many more.
A bit lost, right?
These chemicals are actually
used in paint, clothes,
toys, water bottles, furniture,
and the list goes on and on and on.
Essential to everyday life,
but all made up out of fossil fuel today.
With Clostridium, we could
potentially make all of them
using carbon dioxide instead.
It's really great science.
So it's not the science holding us up.
What about engineering?
Very important, but unglamorous.
Well, engineering requires
lots of innovation, too.
Because we have to replicate a success
in the laboratory test tubes
and scale it up in a much,
much bigger way,
from grams to kilograms
to tons to millions of tons.
Eventually a big factory.
To do that, engineers
often face two challenges.
First, how to build a factory
faster and cheaper.
And then, how to operate it effectively.
Let's say we want to build a plant
that produces 20,000 tons
of clean chemical using carbon dioxide.
Do we build one big reactor
or a few smaller ones?
This is where the process
engineers come in.
How much pressure is needed
in these reactors?
What are the flow rates needed
for the gases or the liquids
so that they are balanced
and the production is most effective?
How much land such a facility will occupy.
How does it integrate
with the existing factory?
And probably most importantly,
how can we build such a plant
faster and cheaper?
Well, all of these considerations
determine the fence, pumps, compressors,
reactors and all the other
parts we will use
and whether we could use
off-the-shelf standardized equipment.
Because otherwise,
if we have to design novel parts,
it will be much more expensive
and often takes much longer.
So this is what engineering
innovation looks like
when it comes to building a big factory.
So it’s almost like picking up
pieces of LEGO blocks
to build a beautiful model
of your own design.
Both creativity and discipline
are needed at the same time.
Then it comes [to] 
operational efficiency.
Feynman Dynamics is another start-up,
they actually combine carbon dioxide
and green hydrogen
to make green hydrocarbons
and produce sustainable
aviation fuel, or SAF
that could potentially
clean up our flights.
So the key is actually a catalyst
that can efficiently convert
carbon dioxide
into carbon monoxide.
And the engineering challenge here
is how to manufacture
such a high-quality catalyst
at much bigger volume.
So the process is almost
like making a fruit smoothie.
You need to blend fruits just right
to get a delicious drink.
But when you try to make
much bigger batches,
sometimes the blender gets too hot
or the fruit doesn't mix well
and that will jeopardize
the taste of our drink.
To tackle this challenge,
engineers at Feynman Dynamics
actually borrowed practice
from pharmaceutical chemistry.
They designed a special
high-speed mixer
that passes the chemicals
at really high velocity in a tube
and then circulates back
the finished product,
back to the main reactor
to make high-quality catalyst.
It's almost like your pre-planned
avocados and apples first,
and then put them back
into the big blender
to get the ultimate drink.
So these rather small engineering steps
actually enabled Feynman Dynamics
to produce their catalysts
at industrial scale.
So today, SAF is still more
than five times more expensive
than conventional jet fuel,
but with lots of innovation like this
and also the production at scale,
I believe SAF can beat jet fuel
in cost within ten years' time.
(Applause)
So the engineers are hard at work,
but what about business?
Because business is all about price,
cost, market and profitability.
And in order to reduce carbon emissions
in the scale of gigatons,
start-ups must turn their science
and engineering innovation
into profitable ventures.
But we got plenty of good news here too.
Some of the technologies are approaching
the moment where they cost the same,
or even less than the fossil
fuel alternative,
sometimes without a carbon price.
Yuanchu is a start-up that makes
calcium carbonate out of carbon dioxide.
So calcium carbonate
may also sound unfamiliar,
but these white powders
are actually in our everyday life,
from paper to toothpaste
to washing powders to car tires.
By using leftover calcium from biomass
or the steelmaking industry,
Yuanchu can actually produce
high-quality calcium carbonate
cheaper than the conventional method,
which is digging limestone
out of the ground
and burning lots
of fossil fuel to make it.
Great green discount, right?
Then sometimes business is all
about the size of the eventual market.
Moguang is another start-up
that actually developed this really
groundbreaking new material
called radioactive cooling.
So this material not only reflects
93 percent of sun radiation back,
it could achieve additional cooling
by radiating the heat back to outer space,
leveraging certain wavelengths’
cooling window.
Guess what requires cooling?
Melting glaciers.
That’s why we launched
a pilot project with Moguang
in Dagu glacier, one of the endangered
glaciers near Tibetan Plateau.
Over the past three years,
the melting has slowed down
by as much as 80 percent.
But --
(Applause)
But the project itself
is actually not a business.
Guess what it is.
Any service that requires cooling.
So that's your mobile phone,
glass wall of a building or data centers.
So the great news is not only Moguang
covered [the] glacier with this material,
they already integrated
many of their material
into hundreds of thousands
of mobile phones and sports cameras
and expanding to other
products very quickly.
So there is truly huge market potential.
Alright, so the science is here,
the engineers are hard at work
and the business models are scaling up.
So our final question is,
can we further accelerate?
Of course we can.
Simply by bringing together scientists,
industry experts and business
people in the same room,
so they start thinking
about all the tough questions
from the very beginning, at the same time.
So the scientists will probably ask
"How much gigajoule of energy is required
to capture one ton of carbon dioxide?"
The industry experts will ask,
"How does your technology
help me decarbonize my industry
and how does it fit into my factory?"
And the investor will probably ask,
"What's your plan to grow your business
by 100 times in the next five years
and to go public?"
This is almost exactly what happened
at CarbonX Program.
Let's just say this productive
dialogue, heated debate,
sometimes really disagreement
can be challenging,
but it really helps speed up the process
because it gets everybody to thinking
about everything at the same time.
Not waiting 200 years like alcohol.
(Laughter)
Now remember Gasgene
and those cute Clostridium.
We recently launched
a clean chemical consortium
that brings consumer brands,
big chemical companies and start-ups
like Gasgene or Yuanchu,
to try to make everything
out of carbon dioxide.
That's also working on science,
engineering and business all at once.
So by now, hopefully you guys understand
why I felt we should [have] every reason
to be really optimistic.
Because we already have
plenty of scientific discovery,
engineering innovation
and business models
so that we should be inspired
to imagine a world
with net zero and cleaner future.
Most likely much better
than what AI can generate for us today.
(Laughter)
Therefore, I'm definitely
drunk on the possibility
of a better and cleaner future.
Cheers, everyone, thank you.
(Cheers and applause)
