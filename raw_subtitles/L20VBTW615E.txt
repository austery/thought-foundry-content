Qiong Yao was buried in the capital. I didn't want to do the show, but I wanted to say a few words when I saw some comments. Someone criticized him, saying that he had to be poisoned one last time before he left this world, and said that if Qiong Yao was in the mainland, he would never commit suicide, and he would definitely live to be 100 years old. This is indeed possible. His words reminded me of the 100-year-old author, Bajing. Bajing spent the last six years in the hospital, living on the gastrointestinal tract and respiratory tract. Later, he was born in a glass ward, relying on the oxygen oxygen. It's hard to even see his family. When the Eight-Six Divine Wisdom was still alive, he had severe depression. He had mentioned the concept of "peace" many times. But it was impossible. The doctor's goal was to make this "Tai Tung" live to 100 years old. He lived to 100 years old. Because many people have to wait for this day. They have to hold a birthday party, give a literature lecture, shoot a county TV series, and publish a lecture. 在这个演讲里,作家于秋雨对比了中国现代作家和世界作家的寿命。之后他写道:我们不妨把视野拓宽,看看人类历史上真正活到一百岁的文学家有几个。由此可以领悟,我们国家和我们这座城市这几天面对着什么样的生命奇迹。他还活着,这几个字已经足够震撼人心。 What I didn't understand at that time was that Bajing was not a person without independent will and courage. In his youth, he could resist the big family. After the Cultural Revolution, he could write, "No matter who pulls a whip on my back, I will never enter my dreams again." Why can't such a person make up his mind about his death in the late years? While claiming that long life is a punishment, while saying that I live for everyone. Who is everyone? Family, unit, party, society. In short, it is a kind of collective will that is higher than individual will. So, the way to respect a person is to collectively deprive the person of the right to choose death. What can make me understand more about Bajing and his children is the Weibo that has been criticized for being poor for 20 years. 他说,如果86岁的穹尧在大陆这么莫名其妙地自杀,政府和社会是要承担巨大责任的,他的子孙也要面临巨大的道义责任。而且这个人要求穹尧的下一代为没有照顾好长辈而羞愧。 It turns out that this matter can really be raised to the height of self-doubt and human life. I can understand the authenticity of this matter. Some people think that Qiong Yao is not a terminal illness, and that life can still be self-reliant. In this case, accepting your own life is a social taboo. 但是没有人会莫名其妙地自杀。在褒贬之前,先要了解为什么。就像琼瑶在书中写的,台湾的自杀率已经与日俱增。大家要去想一想,怎样才能防止绝望的病人自我了断。琼瑶去世前几年,身体已经出现衰退。但她没有公布病情,只是说她很怕得失智症。因为她的母亲、舅舅、阿姨都是得这个病去世的。 他目睹了親人的死亡,活在家族遺傳史的陰影中。他希望眾睹實質者能夠有安樂死的機會。但是台灣對此沒有立法,衛生福利部認為在這個問題上毫無社會共識。所以瓊瑤最大的恐懼是,一旦病情發展,他將不可自主。他在遺書中寫:我怕萬一不幸,成為依賴插管維生的臥床老人,我曾經目睹那種慘狀,我不要那樣的死亡。 He pointed to his husband Ping Xintong. Eight years ago, he suffered severe dementia and severe stroke. Ping Xintong once gave his child a will to not interrupt or enter the patient room when he was in critical condition. He said to leave quietly. But the problem is that dementia is not a disease. 到底插不插鼻尾管来维持她生存,穷尧和他的继子女发生了巨大的分歧。这场众所周知的家族危机中,她输了,交出了丈夫的监护权。她公开写:我失去了辛涛,也失去了他的儿女,因为那根他妈的鼻尾管。 这可能是穹尧写下的文字中最不文艺的一句话,也可见当时他的情绪激烈到了什么程度。此后,穹尧写了给儿子儿媳的公开信,特别强调他将来重病的时候,绝不插鼻胃管和其他维生的管道。帮助他没有痛苦的死去,比千方百计帮助他痛苦的活着更有意义。 儿子表示他同情、理解、承诺。但全王仍然担心孩子会世道临头反悔,跟医生一起,凌止他。对这种可能性的恐惧和排斥是如此之深。86岁时。 穹耀不惜自我了断,来确保他的意愿能够实行。人一定会死的,没有一个人不会死。所以我要选择我怎么样的死法,我最不愿意的就是变成一个卧床老人,求生不得,求死不难。为什么穹耀反应会这么强烈? 十年前我做过一期节目,叫《我的死亡谁做主》。当时对这个问题我也不太明白。不是没有认识,而是没有感觉。所以我需要去医院看一看。这是我在协和医院见到的一位老先生。他在急性肺炎讲究的时候上了呼吸机。这个管子像我拇指一样粗,从他的喉咙里面插进去。送的气是热的,他浑身燥热,经常要斥着上身。 管道压得他的支气管弹性消失,呼吸的张力变小。他经常用手在空中抓挠,脸憋得轻刺。一声声好加大送气量,他的腹部胀得像鼓一样,难受得用手拍,蹦蹦坐下。严重的时候,他还要插上鼻嗣管、静脉插管、尿管和胆囊引流管。 他被这些馆子锁在了床上,锁了四年。不能说话,不能吞咽,不能动。四年里面对的,只是听话板。但他连听话板也看不见了。他妻子说,他因为着急,总是黑天白夜的哭,睁眼哭,闭眼哭,哭的眼睛白内障。 丈夫不能说话了,但总是用口型对她说:"我恨你。"这位老先生在医院工作,很早就对妻子儿子说过不要抢救他,让他好好走。事到临头,儿子说:"赌一把吧,万一呢?"这也是平心掏子女的想法,也许会有奇迹。 他们和穹尧一样,都爱这个人,都认为他爱生命。只不过一方认为,他爱生命,所以一定想活,而另一方认为,他爱生命,所以一定不想这么活。事情就是这样上了绝路。 The main reason I gave in was because I still loved him. I think two kinds of love are different. I have no right to deprive my child of his love for his father. I have to respect him. Qiong Yao agreed to the tea house. From that moment on, he had a clear mind. 在離開人世之前,他貼出了平行濤的病夢,和他最喜歡看的家中園子裡滿樹鮮紅的火焰幕進離。他和平行濤之前每天晚上都要一起看電影。後來在醫院的時候,他一個人坐在病房看。那個電影叫《美好的味道》,是一個科幻片。 说人类失去嗅觉,很快适应了,然后失去听觉。风声,雨声,雷声,鸟啼,听不到了,人就用敲击和震动来弥补。然后人失去了味觉,但为了生存,吃着没有味道的食物。最后,人类失去了视觉,当天地万物变成一片黑暗,世界末日到了。 After watching this film, Qiong Yao said that she had been sitting on the sofa for a long time and couldn't move her because her husband was lying in the distance, relying on the manpower to live in her world. I have been in the tea house for more than a year, so I haven't come out. I am still very sad every day. I am still thinking about what method I can use to break myself. 穷要这种愧疚十年前,我采访陈小路的时候听到过。他的父亲是陈毅。1971年,陈毅常在晚期,靠着呼吸机、书页强行正在维持。人已经不成形了,医生还在一次一次抢救。那个惦记让他父亲从床上跳了起来。陈小路问医生,说能不能不抢救。 The doctor said two things. First, did you make up your mind? Second, do we dare to? Chen Xiaolu was speechless. Chen Yi's treatment plan was decided by Zhou Enlai. Zhou Enlai's treatment plan was decided by Mao Zedong. 日后人们谈论陈寅死亡的时候,总是在谈他死之后毛泽东参加葬礼的场面。谈这个葬礼如何传达了林彪事件之后毛泽东对老干部政策调整的信号,如何释放出邓小平付出的可能。至于赵偏中这个人和他的家人是什么感受,很少有人提。 后来,陈小鲁的母亲,岳父,岳母,都以同样的方式在同一家医院去世。他对我说,本人痛苦,家人痛苦,浪费国家资源。 After decades, he and Luo Ruixin's daughter Luo Dian Dian established the first Chinese association to advocate for dignity death, and chose dignity. Dignity death is a way to give up artificial survival under the condition of treatment, and to reduce the pain to the maximum extent of the patient, and to naturally respect the past. 人们可以在这个网站上签署生前的预注,回答这五个问题:我要或者不要什么样的医疗服务?我用或者不用支持生命的医疗系统?我希望别人怎么对我?我想让我的家人朋友知道什么?我希望让谁帮助我? 所有的选择是开放的。比如说,总是有0.0%的人选择,即使是永久植物人状态,他也想用人工维持生命。可以。这是他的选择,会受到尊重。 人的選擇也是流動的、可變的。所以網站每年會發信提醒,您是否需要調整自己的意願。羅天點說,也許是到臨頭他會改了主意,對孫子說,只要你還有一分錢,你也得留住我。我問他,如果那樣你怎麼看待自己。他笑了,說那我覺得我很真實、很自然。 真正的尊严,是不论这个人什么身份,在什么时刻,都有选择。而且,他的选择被尊重。中央去世之后,台湾有一种评论的声音说,他子孙满堂,生活无忧,却做这样不良的示范,让处在生活边缘的弱势群体情何以堪。 这样我想起十年前播完这个节目之后,留言里有一句,说这帮红二代吃饱了撑的,我们连活的尊严都还没争取到,谈什么死的尊严。这个问题我问过罗点点,说中国还有那么多穷人没有得到应该有的治疗,你们现在提上尊严死,是不是太不合时宜? 他说,这两件事情其实有关系。ICU病房维持人工的血压心率和呼吸,当时每天最基本的花费是五六千,现在是一万,那么一个月下来就是三十万。而中国二三线城市都在一窝封得上ICU病房。为什么?就是有巨大的经济利益。 造成的结果是什么?根据罗点念的统计,中国每年都有80%以上的医疗支出,放在临终人工支持系统的消耗上。他说,如果我们能把这部分医疗资源放到对疾病的防治,放到对于可致于疾病的治疗上,那是不是社会的福音? 台灣沒有高級幹部病房,但是有另外一種可以比擬的情況,就像瓊瑤書裡寫的。根據數據顯示,台灣失能者平均臥床時間長達七年,歐陸國家只有兩週到一個月。因為在台灣,把失去或者失能的父母插上維生管,送到長照中心,輿論認為這才是盡效。 他的好朋友沈君山,國立清華大學的前校長,在兩次中風之後曾經公開發表一註,說這種不可逆的長期痛苦對他和家人、社會都是沉重負擔,他要求尊嚴死。但是,在第三次中風昏迷之後,因為從大陸和美國趕來的親人不同意,他在床上又躺了十年。 往往長期在身邊照顧的親人願意放手,而沒有這個經驗的人恰恰相反。這在台灣叫天邊孝子爭候曲。沈君山是看了他的恩師吾大友臨終的痛苦,才寫了遺囑,沒有實現。 Ping Xintao saw the pain of Shen Junshan, so he wrote a poem, but it didn't come true. Qiong Yao saw the pain of Ping Xintao, so he wrote a poem, but he was worried that it couldn't come true. So what I'm calling is... The most important thing is to give the patient the right to be free of the disease And Tao was the one who wrote down how he wanted to die I didn't help him do this So I think I am ashamed of him Today I am ashamed of him The only thing I can repay is that I wrote this book Let everyone know 人是应该有善终权的。善终权,是琼瑶在人生的最后几年当中用最大气力去争取的事情。2018年她写了《生命的最后一刻》,在发布会上请赵克适来讲。赵克适是把西方的安宁疗顾观念引用台湾的人,这在2000年促进了《安宁缓和医疗条例》的面试。 他又請楊玉新來講,楊玉新是在癱瘓命運的陰影下推動台灣出台了病人自主權利法。在2019年平新高去世的時候,台灣人已經可以選擇在極嚴重的失智狀態下不插光一手。 20年来的努力结果,2015年经济学院智库在进行全球国民死亡质量排名的时候,台湾排在全球第六,亚洲第一,而中国大陆排在的七十一位。陈小鲁因为新耿离世之前,接受采访的时候说,301医院当中的老干部已经有80%的人选择安宁了户。 However, the average people in northern Guangzhou receive less than 1% of the medical care resources. I remember the old man in the box. It was his wife who stayed with him day and night. I saw that the room did not have a bed, and there was no space for a basement. I asked him where he slept. 她从病房的门口抽出一块很窄的板子,搁在两张椅子上。这张板的宽度只够一个人平躺,一翻身就会掉下去。她已经七十多岁了,为了照顾病床上的老伴,就这么睡了四年。只有偶尔换衣服的时候才回一趟家,只有在那个时候她能趴在床上哭一场。 She cried for her husband's suffering, her own tears, and for the flowers and birds that no one else had taken care of. They were all dead. She told me that her husband said, "I hate you. Not only do I blame you, but I also blame myself and feel sorry for you because I feel sorry for her and for the child." Qiong Yao once took care of Shizhi Zheng's mother and husband for a long time. She said that she did not serve them at all. In the will, she wrote, "I do not want to be burdened with love." He did not encourage others to do so. He also asked young people not to do the same thing. This is his usual philosophy. He used seven hours to persuade San Mao, even forced him not to commit suicide, because there are many possibilities in young people's lives. After Ping Xintao died, he also said that he would live a good life for him, a happy life. He lived like this for five years. Before leaving at 86, she recorded many nights and sang many songs, donated the firewood and fish that were full of red flowers. Good night. The day before I died, I said that I had lived, and I could die very happily. 台灣馬上就要進入超高齡社會,中國大陸將緊隨其後。屆時兩岸面臨同樣的現象,五個人當中就會有一位超過65歲的長者。不論你如何看待瓊陽的離開。 What I want to say is that he wants us to discuss. We discuss our partners, our parents, our children. Discuss death. Because my regret is that I was the one who made this show 10 years ago. After I finished, I talked to my husband. But I didn't talk to my parents. Because in my heart, my parents are still young. No. It's not because of this. It's because I never thought my parents would die. This is the result of my father's death in 2019. We had to make his choice. The director of ICU called us over to see my father's chest. He said his organs were all broken. He said it was very bitter. He said there were many young patients in the hospital. The resources to rescue them are a chance to survive. I said I understood. But at that very difficult moment, I was thinking, "Will my father be that 0.0% person? Will he not give up and exist?" In the end, my mother and my sister agreed, and did not insist on it. It was because we and refused to let my father suffer and be lonely. I just walked to their office door. I heard someone screaming in the hallway. She said, "Sister, come quickly." It was my little cousin. I rushed into the ward and saw my father sitting up. He was struggling with his life, but his eyes were not looking at anyone. The nurse told me that it was a brain discharge before the death. The patient was not conscious. But at that moment, all my blood vessels were broken. I shouted out loud, "Send him to the ICU. Save him. He needs to be in the hospital." At that moment, my dad's blood pressure and heart rate dropped rapidly. I knew I was going to lose him. It was only at the last moment that I calmed down. I said, "Dad, come to me. I will live with you. As long as I am alive, you will not die. My father looked at me very slowly. His face was open. At that moment, his heart rate was displayed as zero. All the painful traces were gone. He looked like he was over forty years old. That moment was the comfort I felt in the future pain. Because in that inevitable moment, I received it in my heart. This is why I am doing this program. I want to tell you that 死亡必然到来,而且它必然以你不可能预想的方式到来。所以,和你的亲人交谈,最重要的是和你自己交谈。不要去管那些禁忌,也不要去管别人的观念,而是依据你自己的感受,诚实判断。但是你要选择,否则我们将生死不自由。
