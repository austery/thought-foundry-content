Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.
 We


are
 live.
 It
 is
 Tuesday,


December
 9th,
 and
 I'm
 happy
 to
 be
 back


on
 the
 show.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for


being
 here.
 First
 of
 all,
 I
 am
 sorry
 I


missed
 yesterday
 for
 the
 market
 open
 and


the
 close.
 Also
 missed
 Sunday
 for
 the


future
 show.
 I
 got
 sick,
 but
 not
 like


sick
 to
 the
 point
 where
 I
 had
 to
 go
 to


the
 hospital
 and
 like
 get
 antibiotics
 or


there's
 like
 some
 big
 infection
 or


anything.
 I
 just
 got
 a
 cold
 and
 it
 was


one
 of
 those
 colds
 where
 your
 throat
 is


hurting.
 You're
 coughing.
 You're


sneezing.
 You're
 going
 to
 hear
 me


sniffle
 a
 lot
 throughout
 the
 stream.
 I


got
 a
 towel
 here
 with
 me
 the
 whole
 time


because
 it
 it's
 it's
 it's
 still
 not
 the


best.
 I
 got
 like
 three
 hours
 of
 sleep


last
 night.
 Slept
 at
 1:00,
 woke
 up
 at
 4.


I've
 been
 up
 since
 4:30.
 Like
 I
 just


could
 not
 sleep
 last
 night.
 But
 it's
 not


like
 I
 need
 to
 go
 to
 the
 hospital
 or


anything
 like
 that.
 So
 it's
 one
 of
 those


things
 where
 I
 just
 forget
 talking.


Yesterday
 I
 couldn't
 even
 like
 look
 at
 a


screen
 because
 like
 just
 like
 the
 light


was
 affecting
 my
 eyes.
 It
 was
 just
 it
 it


was
 a
 mess
 yesterday
 and
 it
 kind
 of
 you


know
 I
 felt
 it
 Saturday
 night.
 I
 think


what
 happened
 on
 Saturday
 I
 was
 walking


outside
 in
 the
 cold
 and
 know
 I
 don't


know
 if
 this
 is
 technically
 how
 it


happens
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 was
 really


wearing
 a
 scarf.
 So
 my
 my
 my
 neck
 is


kind
 of
 sensitive
 to
 this
 stuff.
 And


then
 boom
 I
 ended
 up
 just
 getting
 a


cold.
 And
 so
 that's
 that's
 kind
 of
 how


it
 played
 out.
 I
 felt
 it
 Saturday
 night.


Sunday
 I
 woke
 up.
 I
 was
 like
 this


doesn't
 feel
 the
 best.
 I
 was
 like,
 "All


right,
 let
 me
 skip
 the
 future
 show.


Monday
 morning,
 I'll
 be
 okay."
 Then


Monday
 morning,
 I
 woke
 up.
 I
 was
 like,


"There's
 no
 way.
 There's
 no
 way
 this
 is


happening."
 So,
 we
 are
 back.
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 anything
 too
 serious.
 If
 it


was
 serious,
 I
 wouldn't
 be able
 to
 be


streaming
 live.
 I
 mean,
 the
 most
 my


fever
 was
 was
 97.5.
 So,
 it's
 like,
 you


know,
 I
 I
 never
 even
 got
 above
 a
 90.
 I


didn't
 even
 get
 close
 to
 a
 99
 on
 the
 the


fever
 scale.
 So,
 I
 think
 I
 should
 be


okay
 and
 I'm
 happy
 to
 be
 back.
 But


nonetheless,
 we
 did
 have
 a
 scream
 a


stream
 scheduled
 for
 last
 night
 with
 a


rapper
 24K
 Golden.
 Shout
 out
 to
 him
 and


shout
 out
 to
 anyone
 who
 watched
 the


stream
 last
 night.
 Um,
 I
 really
 didn't


want
 to
 cancel
 that
 stream.
 I
 was


supposed
 to
 go
 to
 his
 concert
 on


Saturday.
 I
 missed
 or
 Sunday
 night.
 I


missed
 the
 concert
 because
 of
 being


sick.
 And
 then
 so
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 you


guys
 are
 like,
 "You
 didn't
 seem
 too
 sick


last
 night."
 It's
 because
 I
 like
 drugged


up
 on
 Nyquil
 and
 Tylenol
 to
 make
 sure
 I


could
 do
 that
 stream
 because
 like


there's
 not
 too
 many
 opportunities.
 That


stream
 was
 scheduled
 for
 about
 a
 month


and
 I
 really
 didn't
 want
 to
 cancel
 that


because
 I
 was
 good
 enough
 to
 do
 that


stream
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 after


sleeping
 for
 like
 10
 hours
 and
 so
 that's


why
 we
 were
 able
 to
 do
 it.
 But
 yeah,
 no


fever,
 nothing
 too
 crazy.
 If
 it
 was


anything
 that
 bad,
 I
 would
 have
 told
 you


guys,
 but
 it
 was
 enough
 to
 the
 point


where
 even
 trying
 to
 talk
 in
 front
 of
 a


screen
 for
 five
 hours
 wouldn't
 have


would
 have
 made
 sense.
 But
 we
 are
 back.


I'm
 happy
 to
 be
 here.
 Thank
 everybody


for
 being
 here.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk


about.
 Tons
 of
 stuff
 that
 happened
 over


the
 past
 uh
 couple
 of
 days,
 definitely


over
 the
 past
 24
 hours.
 This
 Netflix


story
 is
 absolutely
 crazy.
 The
 amount
 of


twists
 and
 turns
 that
 it
 has
 taken
 uh


was
 wild.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 talk
 about


what's
 going
 on
 with
 Netflix
 and


Paramount.
 You've
 got
 Nvidia
 updates
 on


Nvidia
 and
 China.
 Some
 stuff
 that's


bullish,
 but
 not
 necessarily
 bullish


enough
 to
 get
 the
 stock
 really
 moving,


although
 the
 stock
 was
 moving
 yesterday.


So,
 we'll
 talk
 about
 that
 and
 we'll
 go


deeper
 into
 we
 got
 jobs
 data
 that
 we'll


talk
 about.
 private
 ADP
 payrolls.
 Uh


Microsoft
 making
 a
 $17
 billion


investment
 into
 India
 for
 AI


infrastructure
 as
 of
 this
 morning.
 So


we'll
 be
 talking
 about
 that.
 Uh
 bunch
 of


different
 capital
 raises.
 So
 Coree
 2.25


dilution
 in
 convertible
 notes.
 They
 have


extended
 that
 offer
 from
 2
 billion
 to


2.25.
 That
 stock
 was
 down
 yesterday.


It's
 recovering
 a
 little
 bit
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 Um
 and
 overall
 markets
 are


red.
 Now,
 the
 biggest
 reason
 they're


red,
 I
 think,
 and
 probably
 the
 reason


they're
 going
 to
 stay
 red,
 I
 mean,
 maybe


we
 recover
 later
 in
 the
 in
 the
 day,
 S&P


500
 right
 here.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 basically


flat.
 It
 was
 worse


about
 an
 hour
 ago.
 Right
 now,
 it's


relatively
 okay.
 Uh,
 is
 we
 have
 the
 Fed


meeting
 tomorrow.
 So,
 the
 Fed
 meeting
 is


a
 big
 big
 deal.
 FOMC
 that
 I
 definitely


wanted
 to
 recover
 before
 the
 FOMC


meeting
 because
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


massive,
 massive
 meeting.
 We
 are
 going


to
 see
 if
 we
 finally
 get
 this
 rate
 cut


that
 we've
 all
 been
 waiting
 for.
 if
 it's


priced
 in,
 if
 it's
 not
 priced
 in,
 how


the
 market
 reacts
 to
 it,
 how
 the


trajectory
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 December,


rest
 of
 2025
 ends
 up
 going
 once
 we
 do


get
 that
 rate
 cut,
 which
 right
 now
 the


probabilities
 are
 at
 89%


um
 or
 87.2%.


So,
 there's
 still
 a
 12.8%
 chance
 we


don't
 get
 it.
 I
 think
 it's
 unlikely,
 but


there
 is
 a
 chance.
 And
 so,
 we'll
 talk


about
 the
 implications
 of
 that
 as
 well.


Also,
 we
 have
 big
 earnings
 this
 week.
 I


mean,
 today
 after
 the
 bell,
 we'll
 have


technical
 Tuesday
 as
 always,
 but
 we
 have


GameStop,
 which
 is
 not
 that
 big
 of
 a


deal.
 Tomorrow
 you
 have
 Oracle
 and


Adobe.
 And
 then
 on
 Thursday
 you
 have


Broadcom,
 Costco,
 and
 Lululemon.
 So


Wednesday,
 Thursday
 we
 actually
 have
 a


decent
 chunk
 of
 earnings
 to
 go
 through.


And
 uh
 we'll
 be
 looking
 at
 what
 those


earnings
 look
 like
 and
 doing
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 preview
 of
 those
 earnings
 as
 we


get
 into
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 week.


That's
 what
 we
 got.
 I
 did
 not
 drink


Saratoga
 water.
 No,
 I
 did
 not.
 You
 know,


honestly,
 over
 the
 past
 couple
 days,


I've
 been
 drinking
 regular
 water.
 Um,


I've
 been
 trying
 to
 just
 drink
 like
 tea


and
 honestly
 that's
 it.
 I
 haven't
 been


eating
 anything
 too
 crazy.
 Talenol,


Nicole,
 this
 it's
 like
 really
 I
 haven't


been
 been
 eating
 much
 over
 the
 past


couple
 days.
 Just
 been
 trying
 to
 get


better.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 texted
 me
 that,


you
 know,
 if
 you're
 in
 the
 Northeast,


the
 cold
 it
 hits
 you
 like
 a
 brick.
 It


really
 does
 come
 out
 of
 nowhere.
 And


like
 now
 it's
 cold
 in
 New
 Jersey.
 Like


before
 it
 wasn't
 cold.
 Now
 it's
 actually


cold.
 So,


um,
 yeah,
 I
 was
 not
 out
 partying
 all


weekend
 like
 some
 people
 thought.
 A
 lot


of
 you
 guys
 thought
 I
 was
 just
 out


partying
 and
 I
 like,
 "No,
 dude.
 It's
 not


it's
 not
 partying."
 I
 was
 I
 was
 like
 I


legit
 just
 ended
 up
 getting
 I
 guess
 a


cold.
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 if
 sick
 is
 the


right
 word,
 but
 it
 was
 enough
 to
 the


point
 where
 it
 would
 be
 hard
 to
 stream.


And
 you
 can
 kind
 of
 tell
 a
 little
 bit
 of


my
 voice
 right
 now,
 but
 I
 think
 uh
 I


think
 we'll
 be
 okay.
 It's
 negative
 five


degrees
 in
 Maine.
 In
 Jersey,
 it's
 18


degrees.
 We
 haven't
 had
 negative
 degrees


in
 Jersey
 Fahrenheit
 in
 a
 long
 time.


Like
 I
 think
 maybe
 five,
 six
 years
 ago.


Usually
 it
 ends
 up
 stopping
 at
 around
 10


15
 degrees,
 but


we'll
 see
 how
 cold
 this
 ends
 up
 uh
 this


ends
 up
 getting.
 All
 right,
 let's
 get


into
 it.
 Thank
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.


Also,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 another
 stream


on
 Friday
 uh
 introducing
 my
 new
 manager


as
 well.
 So,
 I
 told
 you
 guys
 I've
 been


working
 with
 someone
 new.
 She's
 going
 to


be
 on
 the
 stream
 on
 Friday
 at
 call
 it
 7


7:30
 p.m.
 uh
 Eastern.
 And
 so
 I
 think


that
 will
 be
 an
 exciting
 stream.
 We'll


have
 a
 bunch
 of
 fun
 announcements
 for


the
 future
 of
 this
 channel.
 And
 uh
 yeah,


I'm
 excited
 for
 you
 guys
 to
 meet
 her
 and


I
 think
 it'll
 be
 fun
 to
 to
 kind
 of
 get


introduced.
 She's
 going to
 be
 a
 big
 part


of
 this
 community.
 We
 we
 met
 on
 Saturday


as
 well.
 told
 you
 guys
 I
 was
 meeting
 her


and
 uh
 yeah,
 pretty
 much
 signed
 our


contract
 and
 she's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big


part
 of
 this
 community
 over
 the
 coming


years
 and
 quite
 frankly
 she's
 just
 a


hustler.
 She's
 just
 a
 massive
 hustler.


So
 I
 think
 you
 guys
 are
 going
 to
 enjoy


her
 and
 it'll
 be
 really
 fun
 to
 introduce


her
 to
 the
 stream,
 to
 the
 community
 and


get
 things
 going
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 we


got
 to
 do
 next
 year.
 Meetups,
 new


events,
 new
 interviews,
 new
 podcast,
 a


lot
 of
 different
 stuff.
 So
 we'll
 be


doing
 that
 on
 Friday.
 All right,
 so


let's
 get
 into
 it.
 I
 think
 let's
 start


off
 with
 this
 Netflix
 news.
 last
 night.


Big
 deal
 coming
 out
 of
 actually,
 let's


go
 to
 Nvidia
 before
 we
 do
 Netflix.
 Um,


so
 Trump
 basically
 said,
 "Okay,
 I'll


bite."
 And
 Nvidia
 is
 allowed
 to
 sell


into


China.
 So
 H200s,
 which
 are
 the
 2023


version
 of
 Nvidia's
 best
 chip,
 is
 now


approved
 for
 customers
 in
 China.
 25%
 of


each
 of
 those
 ships
 is
 going
 to
 be
 sold


to
 or
 is
 going
 to
 have
 a
 revenue
 share


with
 the
 government
 which
 originally
 was


15%.
 So
 Donnie
 T
 stepped
 it
 up
 to
 25%.


He
 says
 Nvidia's
 US
 customers
 are


already
 moving
 soon
 with
 their


incredible
 highly
 advanced
 black
 belt


chips
 and
 soon
 Ruben
 neither
 of
 which


are
 part
 of
 the
 deal
 and
 my


administration
 will
 always
 put
 America


first.
 Now
 this
 was
 really
 important
 for


Nvidia.
 We
 touched
 190
 for
 the
 first


time
 since
 earnings,
 which
 was
 important


to
 see
 because
 finally
 we
 got
 Nvidia


back
 into
 uh
 the
 groove
 of
 things.
 And


you
 know,
 I
 think
 Nvidia
 should
 be
 well


over
 at
 least
 200
 right
 now
 or
 at least


close
 to
 200
 just
 given
 the
 earnings


that
 we
 saw.
 The
 reason
 Nvidia
 is
 not


back
 at
 190
 is
 because
 the
 Chinese
 came


out
 this
 morning
 and
 they
 said,
 "Hey,


uh,
 well,
 we
 want
 the
 chips,
 but
 we


don't
 really
 want
 the
 chips."
 So


according
 to
 two
 people
 of
 knowledge
 of


the
 matter
 as
 per
 the
 Financial
 Times,


regulators
 in
 Beijing
 have
 been


discussing
 ways
 to
 permit
 limited
 access


to
 the
 H200,
 Nvidia's
 second
 best


generation
 artificial
 intelligence
 chip.


Uh
 essentially
 regulators
 are
 weighing


an
 approval
 regime
 where
 buyers
 might


justify
 why
 local
 chips
 are
 not
 enough.


So
 why
 the
 Huawei
 chips
 are
 not
 as
 good


as
 the
 um
 H200's.


And
 then
 and
 only
 then
 would
 you
 be
 able


to
 get
 access
 to
 the
 H200s.
 Obviously


China
 and
 and
 you
 know
 this
 is
 not
 a


secret.
 They've
 said
 this
 a
 while
 ago.


They
 want
 Blackwell
 and
 they've
 been


wanting
 Blackwell
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 The


United
 States
 has
 not
 really
 budged
 on


that.
 Secretary
 of
 State
 Marco
 Rubio
 is


being
 really
 stringent
 on
 the
 idea
 of


Blackwell
 actually
 being
 sold
 to
 other


uh
 countries.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 I
 I


don't
 think
 this
 is
 going
 to
 move
 the


needle
 massively
 for
 Nvidia
 in
 the


context
 of
 some
 amazing
 uh
 increase
 of


revenue
 because
 they're
 selling
 to


China.
 However,
 what
 it
 will
 do
 is
 get


some
 revenue
 back
 for
 Nvidia,
 which
 to


me
 means
 this
 is
 an
 upside.
 I
 mean,
 we


already
 know
 that
 Nvidia
 is
 basically


guiding
 for
 $500
 billion
 of
 revenue,
 uh,


which
 they're
 likely
 going
 to
 beat
 over


the
 next
 five
 quarters
 without
 China
 and


realistically
 without
 the
 Middle
 East.
 I


mean,
 they're
 just
 factoring
 in
 the


Middle
 East
 into
 all
 these
 projections.


Nvidia,
 right?
 They're
 up
 about
 point4%.


If
 they
 get
 any
 bit
 from
 China,
 you


know,
 even
 if
 it's
 a
 couple
 billion,
 a


couple
 billion
 on
 revenue
 numbers
 that


are
 not
 going
 to
 be
 easy
 to
 beat
 next


year,
 at least
 from
 my
 perspective,
 it's


going
 to
 be
 a
 beat.
 It
 might
 not
 be
 a


beat
 and
 raise
 to
 the
 magnitude
 that


we've
 seen
 over
 the
 past
 couple


quarters.
 I
 mean,
 last
 quarter
 they
 beat


by
 four
 billion.
 Maybe
 they
 beat
 by
 a


billion.
 If
 they
 can
 get
 that
 extra
 two


billion
 every
 quarter,
 maybe
 eight


billion
 for
 the
 year,
 you
 know,
 that


helps
 them
 continue
 to
 beat.
 So
 that
 I


think
 is
 a
 net
 net
 positive
 for
 Nvidia,


but
 the
 street's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 really


see
 if
 China
 is
 going
 to
 be
 willing
 to


sell
 as
 much
 as
 they
 want
 to
 sell
 or
 buy


as
 much
 as
 they
 want
 to
 buy
 from
 Nvidia.


So
 I
 think
 it's
 net
 positive.
 It's
 good


for
 AMD
 as
 well,
 good
 for
 Intel.
 Trump


said
 this
 would
 apply
 to
 both
 of
 those


companies
 as
 well.
 AMD
 and
 Intel
 up
 a


little bit
 in
 the
 pre-markets,
 but
 we're


going
 to
 need
 to
 see
 how
 much
 this


actually
 affects
 Nvidia's
 broader


earnings.
 Trump
 will
 be
 delivering
 a


speech
 around
 the
 economy
 at
 6
 p.m.


tonight
 in
 Pennsylvania.


So,
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 uh
 a
 speech


probably.
 He's
 going
 to
 be
 talking
 about


affordability,
 going
 to
 be
 talking
 about


the
 state
 of
 the
 economy,
 going
 to
 be


talking
 about
 everything
 that's
 going
 on


in
 the
 world
 of
 probably,
 you
 know,
 the


US
 stock
 market
 tariffs.
 I
 mean,
 he's


been
 going
 off
 on
 tariffs.
 You
 know,


we've
 been
 talking
 about
 these
 ideas


that
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 is
 going
 to


reverse
 the
 tariffs.
 Trump
 has
 been


tweeting
 over
 the
 past
 48
 hours
 that


basically
 it's
 very
 likely
 the
 Supreme


Court
 uh
 is
 going
 to
 reverse
 the
 Trump


tariffs
 and
 he's,
 you
 know,
 arguing
 to


the
 American
 people
 how
 bad
 this
 would


be
 for
 national
 security
 even
 though
 the


administration
 has
 some
 plans
 to
 be
 able


to
 navigate
 the
 tariff
 situation
 even
 if


they
 lose
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 case.
 But


he's
 kind
 of
 getting
 the
 American
 people


ready
 or
 at least
 his
 base
 ready
 to


understand
 that
 the
 tariffs
 are
 a


victory
 even
 if
 we
 don't
 have
 access
 to


them
 because
 of
 the
 Supreme
 Court.
 And


you're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 those


arguments
 over
 the
 coming


uh
 over
 the
 coming
 weeks
 from
 the


administration.
 Jose
 says
 they
 really


need
 the
 chips
 all
 cap
 from
 them.
 Yeah.


The
 thing
 about
 the
 Chinese
 as
 well
 is


that
 you
 know
 even
 what
 we've
 seen
 from


Huawei,
 we
 haven't
 seen
 a
 level
 of
 chip


architecture
 from
 the
 Chinese
 companies


that
 is
 still
 as
 good
 as
 even
 Nvidia's


worst
 chips.
 I
 mean
 some
 of
 them
 compare


I
 mean
 even
 some
 of
 them
 compared
 to
 to


what
 Nvidia
 has
 been
 creating
 but
 not
 at


a
 substantial
 level.
 Even
 deepseek


people
 forget
 deepseek
 which
 created


that
 whole
 dip
 opportunity
 on
 video
 when


it
 fell
 50%.
 Was
 trained
 on
 50,000
 H100s


wasn't
 trained
 on
 Huawei
 chips.
 So
 I
 do


think
 the
 Chinese
 are
 kind
 of
 bluffing


right
 here.
 They
 would
 love
 to
 have


access
 to
 these
 chips
 but
 they
 don't


want
 to
 seem
 like
 okay
 fine
 you
 give
 us


your
 B
 chip.
 And
 so
 everyone's
 obviously


going
 to
 know
 that
 Chinese
 models
 are


going
 to
 potentially
 be
 less
 powerful


than
 US
 models
 if
 US
 companies
 have


access
 to
 Black
 Bull
 and
 Reuben.
 China


would
 probably
 rather
 not
 even
 want


those
 chips,
 but
 I
 think
 they
 still
 want


the
 chips.
 Perceptually,
 they
 don't
 want


the
 chips,
 but
 realistically,
 they
 want


the
 chips.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how


the
 market
 thinks
 of
 it.
 Overall,
 I


think
 it's
 net
 net
 bullish
 that
 um


Nvidia
 is
 going
 to
 be
 getting
 these


sales
 to
 China.
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 18648


right
 here
 in
 the
 pre-market.
 Yeah,
 a


little
 bit
 of
 5D
 chess
 being
 played
 from


the
 from
 the
 Chinese.
 So,
 that's
 what


you
 got
 on
 video.
 We'll
 see
 when
 the


market
 opens
 how
 that
 plays
 out,
 but


that's
 kind
 of
 one
 of
 the
 main
 updates


and
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get


back
 to
 that
 190
 range.
 Warner
 Brothers,


let's
 talk
 about
 that.
 Up
 1.32%
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 This
 story
 has
 just
 been


absolutely
 crazy.
 I'm
 sure
 if
 you
 follow


finance
 media
 in
 general
 or
 even


technology
 media,
 everyone
 is
 talking


about
 this.
 And
 you
 know,
 quite
 frankly,


I
 think
 everyone's
 talking
 about
 this


simply
 because
 it's
 going
 to
 affect
 the


media
 landscape
 at
 a
 broad
 broad
 scale.


First,
 let's
 just
 listen
 to
 what
 the
 CEO


of
 Paramount,
 David
 Ellison,
 who
 is


Larry
 Ellison's
 son,
 said
 yesterday


about
 Warner
 Brothers.
 They
 started


initiating
 a
 hostile
 bid
 for
 the


company.
 Just
 like
 you
 have
 insiders
 and


active
 investors
 engage
 in
 hostile


takeovers,
 you
 can
 also
 have
 companies


engage
 in
 hostile
 bids,
 which
 is,
 hey,


if
 you've
 already
 agreed
 to
 sell
 your


company,
 we
 are
 going
 to
 outbid
 you.
 go


direct
 to
 the
 shareholders
 and
 let
 them


decide
 uh
 as
 if
 our
 offer
 is
 better
 than


your
 offer
 and
 the
 company
 which
 has
 a


fiduciary
 responsibility
 to
 evaluate


every
 offer
 has
 to
 take
 it
 seriously
 if


the
 offer
 is
 net
 better.
 Our
 offer
 is


$30
 a
 share,
 all
 cash,
 $41
 billion
 in


equity
 that's
 backs
 stopped
 by
 the


Ellison
 family
 and
 Redbird.
 $54
 billion


in
 debt
 with
 commitments
 from
 City,
 Bank


of
 America,
 and
 Apollo.
 We
 have
 faster


regulatory
 certainty
 to
 close.
 And
 our


deal
 is
 proconsumer.
 It's
 procreative


talent.
 It's
 it's it's
 pro
 competition.


And
 we
 believe
 that
 when
 you
 actually
 to


further
 contextualize
 the
 R
 $30
 in
 cash


or
 sorry
 $30
 a
 share
 is
 is
 basically


$17.6
 billion
 in
 cash
 more
 than
 the
 $20


$23
 a
 share
 that
 they
 signed
 up.
 Right.


Well,
 you're
 not
 obviously
 pay
 you're


you're
 paying
 for
 global
 networks.
 Their


deal
 doesn't
 involve
 paying
 for
 global


networks
 which
 are
 traded
 as
 public


company
 which
 by
 the
 way
 also
 figures


very
 prominently
 here
 and
 in
 trying
 to


determine
 what
 the
 overall
 value
 of
 the


respected
 deals
 are.
 Um
 because
 there


are
 2775
 including
 obviously
 the
 c
 the


stock
 portion
 of
 their
 deal
 but
 it
 also


includes
 well
 what's
 global
 networks
 is


it
 a
 $2
 stock
 is
 it
 a$
 four
 dollar
 stock


what
 do
 you
 see
 because
 that
 can
 go
 a


long
 way
 in
 terms
 of
 at least


determining
 why
 the
 board
 may
 have
 said


no
 we
 think
 Netflix
 is
 superior


>> so
 so
 respectfully
 we
 think
 that


basically
 that's
 valued
 at
 a
 dollar
 a


share
 I
 think
 if
 you


>> why
 a
 dollar


>> so
 if
 if
 you
 look
 at
 vers
 where
 the


median
 of
 all
 of
 this
 is
 it's
 about
 four


and
 a
 half
 times
 you
 you
 have
 to
 get
 to


five
 times
 equity
 value
 or
 for
 to


basically
 get
 to
 the,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of


$3
 plus
 that
 you're
 claiming.
 But
 again,


I
 think
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 to
 go


back
 here
 is
 look,
 we're
 sitting
 on
 Wall


Street
 where
 cash
 is
 still
 king.
 We
 are


offering
 shareholders
 17.6
 billion
 more


cash
 than
 the
 deal
 they
 currently
 have


signed
 up
 with
 Netflix.
 And
 we
 believe


when
 they
 see
 what
 is
 currently
 in
 our


offer
 that
 that's
 what
 they'll
 vote
 for.


So
 he's
 right
 about
 that.
 uh
 they
 are


offering
 more
 cash
 than
 what
 Netflix
 is


offering.
 And
 although
 the
 offer
 is


similar
 to
 the
 offer
 they
 made
 uh
 a
 week


ago
 that
 got
 rejected,
 that
 offer
 wasn't


a
 tender
 offer
 for
 all
 cash.
 And
 I
 think


that's
 kind
 of
 one
 of
 the
 unique


differences
 for
 why
 they're
 they're


going
 straight
 to
 the
 shareholders
 and


making
 the
 argument
 that
 they're
 making.


Now,
 if
 if
 anyone
 knows
 anything
 about


Larry
 Ellison,
 he
 is
 what
 some
 people


would
 call
 the
 king
 of
 hostile


takeovers.
 As
 you
 can
 see
 right
 here,


since
 2003,
 this
 guy
 has
 rapidly
 made


sure
 that
 he
 would
 engage
 in
 either
 an


aggressive
 pursuit,
 aggressive


negotiation,
 or
 a
 hostile
 bid
 to
 be
 able


to
 get
 what
 he
 wants.
 He
 is
 the
 I
 think


fourth
 richest
 person
 on
 the
 planet,


$270
 billion
 net
 worth.
 I
 mean,
 he
 wants


to
 win,
 and
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 he's


easily
 going
 to
 lose.
 Now,
 the
 the
 the


the
 other
 reason
 this
 story
 is
 becoming


so
 interesting
 to
 people
 is
 because,


well,
 two
 things.
 Number
 one,
 uh
 Netflix


already
 signed
 the
 deal,
 right?
 So
 they


already
 signed
 the
 deal
 for
 72
 billion.


That
 deal
 or
 82
 billion.
 That
 deal


doesn't
 include
 the
 TV
 networks.
 And
 so


yes,
 as
 as
 Prunifi
 is
 saying
 right
 here,


Paramount
 wants
 to
 buy
 Discovery.


They're
 offering
 more,
 but
 they're


buying
 more,
 but
 they
 also
 want
 to
 take


off
 the
 cable
 networks
 from
 Warner


Brothers
 Discovery.
 So
 that
 the
 sort
 of


new
 spin
 company
 that
 will
 go
 public
 in


an
 own
 independent
 way,
 which
 that


company's
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 succeed


in
 the
 public
 markets.
 I
 mean,
 let's
 be


honest,
 us
 that's
 linear
 TV.
 Like,
 that


stock's
 not
 going
 to
 get
 bit
 up.
 So,
 I


think
 Paramount's
 argument
 is
 just
 like,


hey,
 we
 already
 have
 the
 existing


infrastructure.
 Why
 don't
 we
 just
 bring


everything
 inside
 our
 house
 and
 keep
 it


going
 from
 there?
 Netflix's
 argument
 is


like,
 we
 just
 want
 the
 studios
 and
 we


think
 that
 we
 are
 paying
 an
 appropriate


price
 for
 the
 studios
 and,
 you
 know,
 we


are
 probably
 better
 people
 to
 sell
 to


versus
 the
 Elson
 family.
 And
 I
 think


there's
 a
 world
 in
 which
 Warner
 Brothers


is
 saying,
 "Yeah,
 we'd
 rather
 sell
 to


the
 400
 billion
 behemoth
 that
 is
 Netflix


versus
 the
 Ellison
 family."
 The
 bigger


question
 is
 why
 does
 the
 Ellison
 family


want
 this
 so
 much?
 And
 that's
 where
 you


get
 into
 the
 political
 angle
 of


everything,
 which
 is
 where
 Trump
 comes


in.
 So,
 multiple
 conversations
 over
 the


past
 48
 hours,
 multiple
 leak
 texts,


multiple
 memos
 have
 come
 out
 basically


saying,
 this
 is
 from
 the
 Trump
 uh
 part


of
 the
 administration,
 which
 is
 that
 he


does
 not
 want
 CNN
 to
 be
 in
 control
 in


the
 way
 that
 it's
 currently
 in
 control.


Trump
 has
 had
 beef
 with
 CNN
 for
 a
 very


long
 time.
 And
 again,
 Netflix
 won't
 have


control
 of
 CNN
 because
 it'll
 be
 some
 new


independent
 company.
 But
 the
 idea
 of


Larry
 having
 control
 of
 CNN,
 I
 mean,


that
 wouldn't
 be
 the
 worst
 in
 the
 world.


That
 would
 probably
 be
 very
 exciting
 for


someone
 like
 Trump
 given
 that
 he
 knows


that
 Larry
 Ellison
 would
 likely
 be
 on


his
 side
 of
 the
 aisle
 more
 so
 than
 uh
 if


someone
 else
 owned
 it.
 By
 the
 way,
 these


are
 the
 text
 messages
 from
 David
 Ellison


to
 David
 Zazlov,
 CEO
 of
 Warner
 Brothers.


Uh
 he
 texted
 him
 right
 before
 the
 deal.


Just
 tried
 calling
 you
 about
 the
 new


bid.
 We've
 heard
 all
 your
 concerns.
 We


believe
 we've
 addressed
 them.
 And
 then


at
 4
 p.m.
 Didn't
 get
 a
 text
 for
 hours.


He
 sent
 him
 this
 paragraph.
 You
 know,


you
 know
 when
 you
 like
 double
 text,
 it's


like,
 "Dude,
 she's
 just
 not
 into
 you."


Yeah,
 this
 this
 is
 what
 happened
 here.


He
 double
 texted
 and
 still
 they
 did
 not


get
 a
 response.
 And
 then
 the
 next
 day


you
 get
 a
 Netflix
 acquisition
 that
 is


reported
 and
 then
 David
 Ellison
 realizes


he
 just
 needs
 to
 go
 straight
 to
 the


people
 and
 make
 his
 bid
 more
 public.
 So


multiple
 parts
 of
 the
 administration
 are


saying
 that
 Trump
 would
 like
 CNN
 to
 be


controlled
 in
 a
 in
 a
 way
 that's
 a
 bit


more
 friendly.
 Uh
 now
 Trump
 has
 come
 out


and
 says
 that
 Paramount
 is
 not
 my


friend.
 Netflix
 is
 not
 my
 friend.
 He's


trying
 to
 stay
 objective.
 He
 even
 said


the
 other
 day
 that
 he
 was
 annoyed
 that


CBS,
 which
 is
 owned
 by
 Paramount,
 uh
 had


a
 60-minute
 special
 with
 Marie
 Marjgery


Taylor
 Green,
 which
 Trump
 is
 not
 a
 fan


of.
 So,
 like,
 you
 know,
 he
 was
 showing


some
 level
 of
 discontent
 for
 for
 what
 uh


Paramount
 has
 been
 doing
 with
 their


programming.
 But
 nonetheless,
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 this
 is
 going
 to
 Oh,
 and
 then
 we


got
 the
 big
 report
 last
 night
 from
 the


Wall
 Street
 Journal
 that
 uh
 Larry
 Ellson


did
 indeed
 call
 Trump
 after
 the


acquisition
 was
 announced
 with
 Netflix


and
 basically
 said,
 "Hey,
 if
 you
 do


this,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 horrible
 for


competition."


I
 honestly,
 if
 you
 had
 to
 ask
 me
 which


way
 does
 this
 get
 resolved,
 I
 have
 no


idea.
 Uh
 the
 the
 prediction
 markets
 are


leaning
 towards
 Poly
 Market
 uh
 or
 not


Poly
 Market,
 uh
 Paramount.
 Poly
 Market


is
 saying
 that
 Paramount's
 most
 likely


going
 to
 win
 this.
 They
 have
 I
 think


like
 a
 45%
 chance.
 And
 I
 think
 our
 boy


Joseph
 Carlson
 had
 a
 great
 tweet
 on
 this


right
 here
 that
 makes
 the
 argument
 for


why
 it
 would
 actually
 be
 more


monopolistic
 if
 Paramount
 wins
 this.


Larry
 Ellson
 and
 his
 son
 will
 control


Tik
 Tok
 with
 Oracle,
 Warner
 Brothers


Studios,
 Paramount
 Pictures,
 CBS,
 CNN,


all
 of
 HBO
 and
 Paramount
 Plus.
 They


would
 also
 control
 most
 of
 every
 major


cable
 channel,
 which
 HBO
 and
 and


Discovery
 own
 like
 a
 good
 150
 of
 them.


And
 they
 would
 have
 distribution
 that
 is


possibly
 even
 greater
 than
 Disney.


I
 mean,
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 Netflix


does
 not
 have
 that
 type
 of
 distribution.


They
 have
 more
 subscribers,
 but
 they


definitely
 don't
 have
 that
 type
 of


distribution.
 One
 could
 argue
 it
 would


make
 a
 massive
 behemoth
 just
 than
 Warner


Brothers
 or
 Paramount
 in
 and
 of
 itself


if
 that
 got
 acquired.
 Now,
 the
 bare
 case


for
 Netflix
 is
 that
 if
 a
 Netflix


acquired
 them,
 you
 have
 this
 massive


level
 of
 intellectual
 property
 like
 DC,


Batman,
 Harry
 Potter,
 etc.
 going
 over
 to


Netflix
 and
 Netflix,
 which
 accounts
 for,


I
 think,
 7.2%
 2%
 of
 TV
 time.
 YouTube's


at
 like
 12%.
 You
 know,
 maybe
 that
 would


allow
 them
 to
 compete
 with
 YouTube.
 So,


I
 really
 am
 not
 sure
 how
 this
 is
 going


to
 play
 out.
 I
 think
 the
 question
 for


all
 of
 us
 as
 investors
 want
 to
 know,
 how


do
 we
 take
 advantage
 of
 this?
 First
 of


all,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 Warner
 Brothers
 is


the
 best
 buy
 right
 here
 because
 here's


the
 worst
 case
 scenario.
 If
 you're


playing
 the
 arbitrage
 on
 Warner
 Brothers


stock,
 which
 look,
 I
 think
 some
 deal
 is


going
 to
 happen
 because
 it's
 Warner


Brothers
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 Trump
 wants


to
 completely
 stop
 any
 type
 of
 merger.


But
 what
 if
 the
 FTC
 just
 blocks
 it


completely?
 What
 if
 they're
 like,
 "Hey,


Netflix
 can't
 buy
 it
 and
 Paramount
 can't


buy
 it
 because
 we
 want
 to
 keep
 more


competition
 involved."
 And
 honestly,
 the


best
 way
 to
 keep
 competition
 is
 for
 a


merger
 to
 not
 happen.
 Like,
 because
 then


you
 have
 HBO
 Max,
 you
 have
 Netflix,
 you


have
 Amazon
 Prime,
 you
 have
 Disney
 Plus.


You
 actually
 have
 like
 a
 real
 uh
 level


of
 of
 competition
 in
 the
 streaming
 wars.


Um,
 and
 this
 stock
 probably
 drops
 back


to
 $12,
 right?
 There's
 no
 reason
 for
 the


stock
 to
 be
 anywhere
 near
 this
 price
 if


there's
 not
 an
 acquisition
 happening.


So,
 that
 right
 there
 would
 be
 not
 the


best
 if
 you're
 holding
 on
 to
 it.
 If
 it


does
 happen
 for
 Paramount,
 I
 think


Netflix
 probably
 goes
 up
 because


shareholders
 aren't
 the
 happiest
 that


Netflix
 is
 wants
 to
 spend
 $82
 billion


and
 Netflix
 will
 survive
 even
 without


this
 acquisition.
 So,
 I
 think
 the
 stock


will
 be
 okay.
 If
 it
 does
 go
 for
 Netflix,


what
 if
 this
 thing
 drops
 dramatically


because
 shareholders
 are
 just
 not


confident
 about
 what
 Netflix
 is
 going
 to


be
 able
 to
 make
 this
 play
 out
 or
 how


Netflix
 is
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 make
 this


play
 out.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I'm
 sitting


out
 of
 this.
 I
 mean,
 I've
 been
 thinking


about
 Netflix
 more
 deeply
 given


everything
 that's
 been
 playing
 out,
 but


I
 think
 the
 regulatory
 scrutiny
 on
 this


is
 going
 to
 take
 time.
 Even
 even
 if
 it


doesn't
 take
 time,
 let's
 say
 Netflix


does
 get
 to
 buy
 them,
 this
 thing's
 not


rocketing
 up
 to
 150
 anytime
 soon.
 I


mean,
 this
 thing
 is
 going
 to
 take
 some


time
 to
 really
 play
 out,
 I
 think
 there's


going
 to
 need
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 inner


workings
 to
 show
 to
 the
 street
 that
 this


acquisition
 makes
 sense.
 Whether
 it's


for
 Paramount
 or
 I'm
 definitely
 not


buying
 Paramount
 stock.
 That
 stock
 has


been
 a
 disaster
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 So,
 I


mean,
 realistically,
 the
 question
 is,
 do


you
 buy
 Netflix
 or
 not?
 And
 I
 think
 even


if
 it
 plays
 out,
 you
 give
 this
 thing


time.
 You
 give
 this
 thing
 time.
 You
 see


if
 Netflix
 can
 meaningfully
 make
 this


accretive
 to
 shareholders
 and
 the


perception
 of
 having
 all
 of
 that
 content


super
 is
 super super
 bullish,
 but
 that


doesn't
 mean
 it's
 necessarily
 going
 to


work
 on
 day
 one
 or
 even
 in
 year
 one.
 And


so
 I
 think
 kind
 of
 being
 on
 the


sidelines
 here
 is
 not
 that
 crazy.
 I


don't
 know if
 Netflix
 is
 the
 opportunity


of
 a
 lifetime
 right
 here
 on
 this
 Warner


Brothers
 deal.
 But
 if
 it
 doesn't
 happen,


I
 think
 there's
 a
 better
 chance
 that


Netflix
 goes
 up
 in
 the
 short
 term.
 In


the
 long
 term,
 I
 do
 think
 they
 need
 to


get
 a
 deal
 like
 this
 because
 ultimately


like
 Netflix
 needs
 better
 content
 and


this
 is
 a
 once
 in
 a-lifetime
 opportunity


to
 be
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 that
 content.


Yeah.
 Netflix
 wants
 IP
 and
 Ellison
 wants


media
 control.
 I
 I
 I
 didn't
 realize


Larry
 Ellison
 is
 on
 this
 whole
 media


like
 uh
 power
 narrative
 that
 he's
 been


going
 on.
 I
 mean,
 like
 I
 know
 the
 guy's


powerful.
 I
 know
 the
 guy
 has
 influence,


but
 like
 the
 Ellison
 family
 is
 which


which
 by
 the
 way
 the
 entire
 bid
 is


backed
 by
 the
 Ellison
 family.
 So
 like


David
 Ellison's
 like
 hey
 like
 we
 are


back
 stop
 Netflix
 like
 we're


backstopping
 it
 with
 our
 equity
 which
 is


worth
 400
 billion
 and
 Larry
 Ellison's


like
 well
 I'm
 worth
 half
 of
 what
 Netflix


is
 worth
 myself.
 I'm
 going
 to
 personally


backs
 stop
 this
 deal.
 So
 I
 guess
 they


want
 to
 control
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 the
 media


landscape
 and
 they're
 going to
 really


fight
 hard
 for
 this.
 Hopefully
 consumers


end
 up
 winning
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day.


This
 story
 is
 not
 over
 and
 it
 looks
 like


the
 story
 is
 going
 to
 be
 playing
 out


for
 a
 long
 long
 time
 to
 see
 uh
 see
 who


ends
 up
 winning.
 Yeah,
 Kushner
 is
 also


in
 it
 as
 well.
 The
 Saudis
 are
 in
 it
 on


Paramount.
 I
 mean,
 you've
 got
 all
 these


different
 characters
 that
 are
 now


entering
 the
 mix.
 It's
 like,
 dude,
 who


would
 have
 thought
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the


year
 one
 of the
 hottest
 media
 stories


would
 be
 Netflix
 versus
 Paramount.
 Like,


I
 did
 not
 have
 that
 on
 my
 bingo
 list.


But
 there
 you
 go.
 And
 that's
 what's


happening.
 And
 we're
 going
 to
 see


ultimately
 how
 the
 street
 thinks
 of
 it.


Netflix,
 right?
 They're
 up
 a
 little bit


in
 the
 pre-market.
 Warner
 Brothers
 up


1%,
 S&P
 500
 is
 flat,
 down
 about
 10%.
 In


the
 pre-market.
 Uh,
 quick
 update
 on


Grab.
 So,
 uh,
 we
 got
 an
 update
 right


here
 from
 Benchmark.
 They
 reiterated


their
 $7
 price
 target.
 I
 think
 there's


two
 things
 to
 talk
 about
 on
 Grab.
 Number


one,
 uh,
 and
 this
 is
 I
 honestly
 didn't


think
 of
 this
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 of


weeks,
 but
 this
 also
 probably
 explains


why
 Grab
 has
 been
 selling
 off.
 Um,
 C


Limited,
 C
 Limited
 is
 down
 about
 30%


over
 the
 past
 month.
 I'm
 not
 even
 sure


why
 I
 haven't
 analyzed
 C
 Limited
 as


aggressively
 as
 I
 probably
 should
 given


it's
 another
 Southeast
 Asian
 rival,
 but


that
 stock
 has
 been
 hit.
 And
 so,
 when


you
 have
 a
 major
 competitor
 that's
 has


way
 better
 margins
 than
 Grab
 and
 it's


growing
 faster
 than
 Grab,
 you
 know,
 when


that
 drops
 30%,
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 its


rivals
 also
 probably
 drop
 with
 it.
 So,
 I


think
 that's
 one
 of the
 reasons
 it's


been
 hit.
 Benchmark
 said
 this
 morning,


"We
 recently
 hosted
 the
 Grab
 IR
 team
 for


a
 virtual
 investor
 meeting.
 The
 company


is
 targeting
 sustained
 growth
 across
 its


core
 segments,
 deliveries,
 and


mobilities
 while
 maintaining
 stable


incentive
 levels.
 Its
 fintech
 business's


position
 for
 accelerated
 loan
 book


expansion
 has
 a
 clear
 path
 to


profitability.
 Um,
 the
 reason
 their


share
 prices
 pulled
 back
 in
 recent


months
 is
 largely
 due
 to
 profit
 taking


and
 high
 beta
 outperformers,
 which
 you


know,
 Grab
 did
 get
 to
 650.
 It
 was
 up


almost
 50%
 for
 the
 year.
 The
 company's


characteristically
 conservative


guidance,
 which
 the
 market
 had


anticipated.
 Nevertheless,
 we
 believe


fiscal
 year
 2026
 setup
 remains


favorable.
 RAP
 continues
 to
 leverage


affordability
 initiatives.
 In
 our
 view,


the
 recent
 share
 price
 weakness


represents
 an
 attractive
 entry
 point
 for


investors
 seeking
 compelling


opportunities
 for
 an
 emerging
 markets


portfolio
 going
 into
 fiscal
 year
 2026.


So,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 understand
 that


people
 hate
 the
 price
 action.
 I
 get
 it.


It's
 not
 fun
 having
 that
 as
 a
 heavy
 part


of
 my
 portfolio.
 Trust
 me,
 if
 I
 have


taken
 the
 money
 I
 put
 in
 Grab
 in
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 year
 and
 I
 put
 it
 into


like
 even
 Nvidia
 or
 anything
 else,
 you


know,
 it
 probably
 would
 have
 generated


even
 better
 year-to-
 date
 returns
 for


me.
 But
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 I
 believe


the
 stock
 is
 still
 undervalued
 and
 I


cannot
 fully
 control
 the
 price
 action.
 I


think
 at
 this
 point
 at
 $511,
 it
 is


stupid
 trading
 at
 these
 levels.
 I
 don't


have
 the
 explanation
 for
 why
 outside
 of


maybe
 the
 correlation
 with
 C
 Limited


going
 down.
 But
 I've
 done
 the
 valuation


work
 and
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 have
 done


the
 valuation
 work.
 Stock
 is
 cheap.


question
 is
 what
 changes
 the
 narrative?


Obviously
 got
 the
 go-to
 thing
 that's


probably
 going
 to
 resolve
 itself
 towards


the
 end
 of the
 year
 and
 we're
 going
 to


see
 how
 that
 acquisition
 changes
 how
 the


company's
 thinking
 of
 it.
 But
 the
 volume


over
 the
 past
 couple
 days
 has
 also
 been


around
 40
 million
 shares.
 You
 know,


volume
 was
 dying
 out
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago,


volume
 has
 started
 to
 come
 back.
 Stock


price
 has
 just
 been
 not
 cooperating.
 So,


it's
 one
 of
 those
 dog
 days
 for
 the
 stock


where,
 you
 know,
 with
 Hood
 down
 for
 two


years
 at
 six,
 seven
 bucks.
 Same
 thing


with
 Pounder.
 Not
 saying
 grab
 his
 hood


or
 pound pouncer,
 but
 you
 do
 have
 these


periods
 where
 it's
 stuck
 and
 you
 don't


know
 why
 it's
 stuck,
 but
 you
 do
 know


everything
 is
 going
 up
 and
 to
 the
 right.


You're
 waiting
 for
 the
 stock
 price
 to


reflect
 that.
 If
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 wait


for
 that,
 then
 there's
 plenty
 of
 other


volatile
 names
 that
 are
 out
 there
 that,


you
 know,
 probably
 have
 quicker
 price


action.
 But
 with
 Grab,
 I
 continue
 to


hold
 it.
 And
 if
 we
 fall
 below
 five,
 I


will
 continue
 to
 add
 more.
 I
 already


have
 a
 pretty
 heavy
 position,
 but
 if


this
 thing
 really
 ends
 up
 getting
 lower,


then
 I
 likely
 will
 be
 adding
 more.
 But


yeah,
 all
 the
 analysts
 continue
 to


believe
 $7
 is
 the
 price
 target.
 You
 have


some
 of the
 most
 bullish
 analysts
 at


around
 $8.
 I
 think
 closer
 fair
 value
 is


around
 720
 730
 right
 now
 and
 we're
 going


to
 see
 how
 this
 ends
 up
 playing
 out
 as


we
 get
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 Uh


Whimo
 news,
 super
 bullish
 for
 Google.


Now
 Google
 went
 down
 yesterday.
 Not
 sure


why
 they
 deserve
 to
 go
 down.
 We'll
 talk


about,
 you
 know,
 exactly
 the
 headline


that
 caused
 it,
 but
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this.


Whimo
 is
 now
 providing
 over
 450,000


paid
 robo
 taxi
 rides
 per
 week.
 That's
 up


from
 250,000
 per
 week
 just
 7
 months
 ago.


I
 mean,
 this
 is
 absolutely
 incredible.
 I


I
 feel
 like
 we
 don't
 talk
 about
 Whimo


enough.
 We
 know,
 you
 know,
 Tesla
 ro.
 By


the
 way,
 I
 did
 download
 uh
 14.2
 on
 um
 on


my
 Tesla
 and
 it's
 amazing.
 I've
 had
 it


for
 about
 a
 week
 now.
 Absolutely


amazing.
 Like
 I
 I
 there
 is
 a
 noticeable


difference
 between
 14.2
 and
 13.9.


And
 so,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 loving
 FSD
 on
 my


Tesla,
 but
 Tesla
 is
 obviously
 not
 having


450,000
 paid
 robo
 taxi
 rides
 per
 week.


Now,
 once
 they
 end
 up
 scaling
 it
 and
 you


have
 millions
 of
 Teslas
 functioning
 as


the
 fleet
 of
 robot
 taxes,
 kind
 of
 that


whole
 broader
 FSD
 thesis,
 then,
 you


know,
 maybe
 450,000
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a


nothing
 burner
 in
 the
 coming
 years.
 But


right
 now,
 Whimo's
 crushing
 it
 and
 uh


they've
 added
 multiple
 new
 cities
 over


the
 past
 week.
 San
 Francisco,
 Los


Angeles,
 Phoenix,
 Austin,
 and
 Atlanta
 is


where
 they
 have
 200
 vehicles
 that
 are


doing
 the
 450,000
 paid
 robo
 taxi
 rides


every
 single
 week.
 So,
 why
 was
 Google


down
 yesterday?
 Well,
 there
 are
 reports


that
 Gemini
 is
 getting
 ready
 to


incorporate
 advertising
 in
 2026.
 Google


came
 out
 and
 they
 kind
 of
 denied
 it,


even
 though,
 you
 know,
 we
 know
 that
 ads


are
 eventually
 coming
 to
 Gemini.
 And


Google
 right
 there
 was
 down
 about
 2%


yesterday,
 down
 another
 1%
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 the
 dumbest


reason
 for
 Google
 to
 sell
 off.
 I
 think


this
 is
 a
 fake
 reason.
 Google
 is
 selling


off
 because
 it's
 up
 80%
 for
 the
 year
 and


people
 are
 taking
 profits,
 not
 because


they're
 going to
 incorporate
 ads
 into


Gemini.
 Because
 quite
 frankly,
 if
 they


incorporate
 ads
 into
 Gemini,


um,
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 good
 for
 Google.


They
 have
 650
 million
 monthly
 active


users
 on
 Gemini.
 If
 they
 start
 showing


you
 ads,
 they're
 going
 to
 start


monetizing
 that.
 So,
 I
 don't
 see
 how


this
 is
 bearish
 unless
 the
 street
 thinks


people
 will
 stop
 using
 Gemini
 because
 of


the
 advertising,
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 stupid


to
 me.
 So,
 I
 think
 people
 are
 selling


Google
 because
 they
 need
 to
 take


profits.
 And
 like
 that's
 fair.
 If
 Google


closes
 below
 300
 and,
 you
 know,
 it


closes
 the
 year
 at
 295,
 okay,
 Google


will
 be
 up
 63%
 instead
 of
 84%.
 Like,


it's
 just
 not
 something
 that
 I
 think


people
 should
 be
 too
 concerned
 over.


Probably
 creates
 a
 better
 buying


opportunity.
 You
 know,
 now
 you've
 got


Buffett
 on
 your
 side.
 Google's
 still
 up


77%
 year
 to
 date.
 But
 it
 does
 seem
 like


the
 profit
 taking
 is
 the
 bigger
 reason


for
 the
 sell-off,
 not
 necessarily
 the


potential
 in
 advertising.
 Now,
 the
 Wall


Street
 Journal
 came
 out
 with
 an
 article


about
 uh
 Sam
 Alman
 and
 this
 code
 red
 on


OpenAI.
 I
 read
 the
 whole
 article
 this


morning.
 Um
 it
 does
 seem
 based
 on
 the


leaked
 memos
 from
 Sam
 Alman
 to
 the


company
 which
 somehow
 keep
 getting


leaked,


you
 got
 some
 people
 in
 OpenAI
 that
 are


constantly
 leaking
 these
 memos.
 We'll


talk
 about
 the
 European
 Union
 lawsuits


because
 they
 are
 starting
 to
 tax
 these


American
 tech
 companies
 at
 a
 at
 a


heavier
 rate.
 Um


Sam
 Alman
 basically
 said
 we
 need
 to
 stop


working
 on
 Sora
 which
 is
 their
 video


generation
 model.
 We
 need
 to
 stop


working
 on
 enterprise.
 We
 need
 to
 just


make
 chat
 GPT
 better.
 And
 so
 the
 crux
 of


his
 memo
 to
 uh
 the
 team
 was
 that
 if
 we


make
 GPT
 better
 we
 will
 have
 a
 chance
 to


increase
 all
 the
 other
 parts
 of
 the


business.
 But
 the
 only
 way
 we
 increase


the
 other
 parts
 of the
 business
 is
 by


focusing
 on
 GPT
 which
 by
 the
 way
 I
 kind


of
 think
 is
 the
 right
 way
 to
 I
 mean
 GPT


ever
 since
 I
 subscribed
 to
 it
 a
 couple


weeks
 ago.
 Uh
 I'm
 now
 paying
 that
 $20
 a


month.
 It's
 become
 my
 go-to.
 I've
 like


stopped
 using
 Grock.
 I'm
 sorry,
 but


Grock
 is
 not
 good.
 I
 love
 Elon.
 I
 pay


the
 freaking
 $50
 a
 month
 for
 X.
 Like,


it's
 it's
 not
 good.
 It's
 just
 not
 It's


not
 It's
 not
 as
 good
 as
 Chachi.
 So,
 I


think
 if
 they
 focus
 on
 continuing
 to


grow
 that
 that
 is
 going to
 be
 a
 massive


massive
 tailwind
 for
 them.
 The
 question


is,
 can
 they
 continue
 to
 focus
 on
 just


the
 consumer
 side
 of
 the
 business
 and
 be


able
 to
 scale
 to
 the
 point
 where
 they


can
 spend
 the
 1.4
 4
 trillion
 that


they've
 guided
 that
 they're
 going
 to


spend
 in
 terms
 of
 capex
 and
 grow
 as
 fast


as
 they
 need
 to
 grow.
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


the
 model's
 good,
 but
 there's
 plenty
 of


people
 that
 might
 like
 Grock
 because


they
 have
 a
 different
 use
 case
 or
 might


use
 claw
 on
 a
 daily
 basis
 and
 they
 don't


care
 that
 much
 about
 GPT.
 So
 Sam
 Alman's


vision
 is
 kind
 of,
 hey,
 we're
 going
 to


keep
 growing
 this
 and
 make
 it
 the
 best


model.
 You
 know,
 they
 already
 have
 800


million
 monthly
 active
 users.
 Can
 they


get
 to
 that
 billion
 and
 is
 that
 billion


going
 to
 be
 enough?
 And
 then
 you
 got


this
 report
 from
 Meta.
 Meta
 is


reportedly
 preparing
 a
 new
 proprietary


AI
 model
 codenamed
 Avocado
 for
 Q1
 2026


positioned
 as
 the
 successor
 to
 its
 open


source
 Llama.
 I
 think
 Meta
 has
 to
 do


this.
 Quite
 frankly,
 if
 you're
 long


meta,
 you
 you
 know,
 you
 can't,
 I
 think,


just
 rely
 on
 the
 advertising
 business.


You
 have
 to
 be
 wondering
 what
 they're


doing
 with
 their
 capex.
 And
 their
 capex


has
 to
 be
 having
 some
 type
 of
 AI


product.
 In
 this
 case,
 it's
 probably
 a


new
 model.
 And
 whatever
 avocado
 looks


like,
 whether
 it's
 for
 enterprise


adoption,
 whether
 for
 it's
 it's
 it's
 a


follow-up
 to
 their
 series
 of
 llamas
 for


the
 consumer
 use
 cases
 in
 Meta
 AI,
 it's


got
 to
 be
 something
 that
 gets
 people


excited.
 The
 problem
 is
 it
 just


continues
 to
 create
 competition
 through


GPT.


And
 so
 I
 think
 OpenAI
 is
 in
 a
 pretty


precarious
 position
 right
 here
 because


obviously
 Google
 has
 way
 way
 more


distribution.
 Google
 is
 crushing
 it
 with


Gemini
 3.
 Nano
 Banana
 is
 off
 the
 charts.


GPT
 is
 still,
 I
 think,
 one
 of
 the
 better


models.
 5.2
 likely
 is
 coming
 out
 uh


early
 2026,
 but
 the
 fact
 that
 they've


stopped
 focusing
 on
 all
 the
 other


business
 initiatives
 just
 to
 make
 the


model
 better.
 By
 the
 way,
 there
 was
 a


lot
 of
 researchers
 who
 again
 anonymously


told
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 that
 um
 Sam


Alman
 is
 sacrificing
 safety
 for
 growth


because
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 things
 that
 they


felt
 were
 unsafe
 with
 the
 mental
 health


portions
 of
 the
 model,
 they
 feel
 they


fixed.
 In
 fact,
 Sam
 Alman
 was
 on
 the
 uh


Jimmy
 Fallon
 show
 last
 night.
 It
 was
 one


of the
 most
 awkward
 conversations.
 I


mean,
 again,
 like
 the
 guy
 is
 a
 bit
 weird


when
 it
 comes
 to
 these
 public


interviews,
 but
 um
 like
 he's
 sacrificing


what
 Daario,
 who
 created
 Anthropic,
 who


used
 to
 work
 at
 OpenAI,
 really
 cared


about,
 which
 is
 safety
 for
 user
 growth.


And
 the
 question
 is,
 is
 it
 going to


work?
 And
 is
 it
 going to
 be
 the
 best


investment
 that
 Open
 AAI
 can
 make
 going


into
 the
 future?
 Google
 doesn't
 really


need
 to
 sacrifice
 all
 those
 types
 of


things
 because
 Google
 has
 a
 lot
 of


money,
 a
 lot
 of
 distribution,
 and
 a
 lot


of
 time
 to
 be
 able
 to
 work
 on
 the
 parts


of
 the
 business
 that
 don't
 need
 to
 make


money.
 Like
 Gemini
 doesn't
 need
 to
 make


a
 single
 penny
 for
 them
 because
 they've


got
 the
 search
 business.
 Whereas
 GPG


needs
 to
 generate
 revenue
 today.


Otherwise,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 investors
 like


SoftBank
 putting
 in
 40
 billion
 are
 not


going
 to
 be
 happy
 in
 the
 next
 coming


years.


So,
 we're
 going
 to
 see,
 but
 more
 and


more
 competition
 is
 good
 for
 consumers,


and
 ultimately,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to


keep
 up
 with
 OpenAI
 and
 see
 if
 they
 can


actually
 commit
 to
 the
 spending
 that


they've
 said
 they
 can
 commit
 to.
 And


that
 relies
 on
 the
 models
 growing
 as


fast
 as
 uh


as
 fast
 as
 they
 need
 to
 grow.
 Yeah,


Avocado
 is
 the
 new
 meta
 model
 that
 uh


well,
 it's
 the
 code
 name
 for
 the
 meta


model
 that
 will
 be
 announced
 probably


early
 in
 Q1
 of
 2026.
 as
 per
 meta
 the
 the


description
 is
 it's
 a
 frontier
 AI
 model


codenamed
 avocado


and
 it
 doesn't
 look
 like
 it's
 going
 to


be
 a
 uh
 open
 source
 model
 because
 llama


as
 an
 open
 source
 architecture
 kind
 of


failed
 seems
 like
 closed
 source
 is
 the


way
 for
 people
 to
 actually
 make
 money
 I


don't
 know
 why
 they
 called
 it
 avocado


but
 yeah
 it
 looks
 like
 that
 is
 the
 new


the
 new
 model
 that
 they
 have
 uh
 jobs
 so


private
 employers
 added
 4750
 50
 jobs


weekly
 in
 November.
 The
 street
 expected


a
 loss
 of
 13,000
 jobs.
 Came
 into
 an


increase
 of
 4,750
 jobs.
 We'll
 talk
 more


about
 what
 we've
 got
 with
 rate
 cuts


coming
 up
 uh
 tomorrow.
 There's
 an
 89.4%


chance
 now
 of
 us
 getting
 this
 rate
 cut.


I
 think
 this
 jobs
 data
 is
 minuscule.


It's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 enough
 to
 take
 away


from
 the
 rate
 cut.
 You
 know,
 you've
 got


some
 people
 like
 Rick
 Reer
 from
 Black


Rockck
 saying
 that
 we
 should
 be
 doing
 50


bips
 tomorrow.
 You've
 got
 a
 lot
 more
 of


the
 doves
 coming
 out
 just
 based
 on
 some


of
 the
 labor
 market
 data
 that
 they're


seeing.
 I
 think
 we'll
 get
 25.
 I
 doubt


we're
 going
 to
 get
 50.
 But
 the
 idea
 that


we
 don't
 get
 any
 rate
 cut
 is
 likely
 not


going
 to
 happen.
 So
 question
 is
 if
 it's


priced
 in,
 and
 we'll
 talk
 more
 about
 if


that
 ends
 up
 being
 priced
 in.
 But
 I
 do


think
 there's
 a
 shot
 for
 the
 market
 to


rip
 tomorrow
 if
 they
 feel
 the
 rate
 cut


is
 a
 meaningful
 differentiator
 going


into
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 Here's


Mike
 Wilson
 and
 his
 thoughts
 on
 what


he's
 thinking
 for
 where
 the
 rate
 cut


takes
 us
 by
 the
 end
 of
 December.
 data


now
 is
 that
 the
 rate
 of
 change
 on
 both


payrolls
 and
 layoffs
 peaked
 or
 bottom


depending
 on
 which
 one
 you're
 looking
 at


in
 April,
 right
 when
 the
 market
 bottom.


So,
 and
 this
 narrative
 that
 we've
 had


for
 a
 while
 now
 is
 becoming
 a
 bit
 more


popular.
 We
 like
 that
 that
 other
 people


are
 kind
 of
 adopting
 it
 to
 some
 degree


because
 they're
 looking
 for
 a
 rationale


or
 reason
 for
 why
 the
 market's
 done
 when


it's
 done.
 And
 that
 is
 very
 important


for
 next
 year
 because
 a
 it
 means
 the
 Fed


has
 more
 room
 to
 cut
 than
 probably


people
 think,
 okay?
 Or
 they
 can
 do


things
 with
 the
 balance
 sheet.
 And


secondly,
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 rotation


now
 into
 the
 parts
 of
 the
 market
 that


have
 not
 performed
 that
 well.
 That's
 our


call
 for
 2026.


>> Why
 would
 uh
 the
 labor
 market
 not
 being


weak
 give
 the
 Fed
 more
 opportunity?


>> Well,
 because
 they're
 going
 to
 realize


that
 their
 the
 data
 itself
 is
 very


lagged.
 I'm
 not
 blaming
 the
 Fed.
 This
 is


tricky.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 hard
 in
 real
 time.


The
 data
 has
 not
 been
 weak
 enough
 to


justify
 cutting
 more.
 But
 when
 they


actually
 look
 at
 the
 revisions
 now,
 and


that's
 what
 we
 do.
 We
 look
 at
 the


revisions,
 it
 pretty
 much
 clear,
 it's


very
 clear
 that
 we
 had
 a
 significant


labor.


>> We
 already
 came
 out
 of
 it


>> and
 we've
 come
 out
 of
 it,
 which
 is
 very


good.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 the
 best


confirmation
 of
 this
 is
 that
 the


earnings
 growth
 now
 for
 the
 median


company
 in
 the
 S&P
 is
 actually
 growing


again
 close
 to
 10%.
 That's
 the
 best


growth
 we've
 seen
 in
 four
 years.
 So


there's
 evidence,


>> but
 you
 are
 counting
 on
 the
 labor
 data


still
 being
 lagged
 for
 why
 the
 the
 Fed


will
 cut
 rates
 that
 they're
 not
 going
 to


pay
 attention
 to
 the
 things
 you're


watching
 right
 now.


>> That's
 right.
 Well,
 I
 think
 what
 they'll


notice
 is
 that
 if
 you
 want
 a
 recovery
 in


the
 private
 economy,
 which
 we
 all
 do,


right?
 We
 don't
 want
 to
 just
 have
 this


bifurcated
 economy.
 They
 they'll
 realize


that
 we
 need
 we
 do
 need
 rate
 cuts
 for


the
 financial
 leverage
 part
 of
 the


economy,
 whether
 it's
 housing,
 you
 know,


consumer
 goods,
 the
 lower-end
 consumer,


we
 need
 that.
 And
 so
 the
 risk
 in
 this


strategy,
 of
 course,
 for
 the
 Fed
 to


think
 about
 is
 do
 we
 have
 an
 asset


bubble
 then,
 right?
 Because
 if
 they
 cut


into
 that
 good
 earning
 cycle,
 do
 we
 get


kind
 of
 an
 inflated
 stock
 market?
 Our


view
 is
 yes


>> asset
 inflation
 and
 people
 are
 still


worried
 about
 big
 inflation
 the
 the
 uh


the
 overall
 term
 inflation
 people
 are


still
 we're
 3%.


>> The
 lagging
 numbers
 there
 it
 would


indicate
 what
 in
 in
 your
 view
 that
 it's


not
 a
 problem
 or
 it
 is
 a


>> well
 I
 mean
 it's
 sort
 of
 a
 sort
 of
 a


feature
 okay
 quite
 frankly
 like
 in
 other


words
 if
 and
 we
 said
 this
 last
 time
 I


mean
 if
 we
 don't
 get
 inflation
 next
 year


reacelerating
 then
 our
 call
 is
 going to


be
 wrong.
 In
 other
 words,
 and


accelerating
 inflation
 is
 good
 for


company
 earnings
 in
 most
 for
 the


companies
 that
 have
 been
 lagging
 it,
 but


it's
 bad
 if
 the
 Fed
 is
 is
 raising
 rates


for
 the
 stock
 market.
 This
 time
 around,


right,
 we
 have a
 Fed
 that's
 not
 going
 to


be
 raising
 rates.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 much


they're
 going
 to
 cut
 next
 year,
 but
 it's


unlikely
 they're
 raising
 rates
 and


they're
 probably
 going
 to
 add
 liquidity


to
 the
 balance
 sheet
 at
 a
 time
 when
 when


ex
 when
 accelerating
 inflation
 is


driving
 better
 earnings
 growth.
 That's
 a


very
 good
 setup
 for
 equities
 typically.


>> And
 you
 know what
 else?
 Hasset
 was
 on


yesterday
 and
 he
 said
 the
 the
 way
 we


administration
 handles
 the
 affordability


issue
 is
 by
 wage
 gains.
 They
 they
 I


think
 they've
 given
 prices
 you
 know


energy
 prices
 can
 come
 down,
 food
 prices


can
 come
 down
 but
 in
 general
 inflation


doesn't
 come
 down
 unless
 you
 got
 serious


uh
 overall
 problems
 uh
 in
 the
 economy.


So
 how
 do
 you
 deal
 with
 affordability?


Wage
 growth
 has
 to
 be
 faster
 than
 than


the
 inflation


>> and
 productivity


>> and
 productivity.
 And
 you
 think
 that's


possible?


>> Well,
 yeah.
 I
 mean
 that's
 what
 the
 the


policy
 change
 is
 trying
 to
 do
 right
 is


that


>> which
 policy
 the
 big
 BBB


>> all
 of
 the
 fiscal
 policy
 let's
 think


about
 this
 so
 they're
 trying
 to
 reduce


consumption
 okay
 increase
 investment


through
 the
 big
 beautiful
 bill
 and


through
 tariffs
 that
 reconfiguration
 of


how
 the
 economy
 grows
 should
 lead
 to


better
 productivity
 the
 big
 one
 that


there's
 debate
 on
 which
 I
 don't
 think
 is


really
 that
 debatable
 is
 immigration


right
 so
 this
 you
 know
 legal
 immigration


unfettered
 immigration
 has
 really


suppressed
 real
 wage
 growth
 to
 your


point
 for
 the
 middle
 income
 for
 the


lower
 income
 workers
 And
 then
 if
 you


think
 about
 AI
 suppressing
 wage
 growth


perhaps
 at
 the
 upper
 end
 that
 that's
 a


nice
 rebalancing
 potentially
 on
 the
 on


the
 real
 wage.
 Look
 this
 is
 this
 is
 not


a
 for
 I
 mean
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 guarantee


it's
 going
 to
 work
 but
 I
 like
 that


strategy
 as
 a
 way
 to
 rebalance
 decay


economy.


>> And
 quite
 frankly
 I
 don't
 know
 what


other
 strategy
 we
 have.
 I
 mean,
 Mike


Wilson
 is
 talking
 about
 how
 the
 one
 big


beautiful
 bill
 essentially
 said,
 "We're


going
 to
 decrease
 or
 incentivize
 the


decrease
 of
 consumption
 and
 increase
 or


incentivize
 the
 increase
 of
 investment,


which
 is
 exactly
 what
 we've
 been
 seeing


across
 these
 tech
 companies
 that
 have


been
 investing
 in
 capex.
 We
 know
 that


50%
 of
 GDP
 since
 2023
 has
 been
 because


of
 big
 tech
 capex
 investments.
 If
 that


didn't
 happen,
 we
 would
 not
 have
 the


market
 that
 we
 have
 today.
 We
 would
 not


be
 growing
 the
 way
 that
 we're
 growing.


It
 continues
 today
 with
 Microsoft
 $17.5


billion
 investment
 in
 India
 particularly


on
 sovereign
 AI
 and
 AI
 infrastructure.


I
 mean
 I
 I
 think
 this
 is
 just
 going
 to


continue.
 You're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 lot
 more


of
 these
 tech
 companies
 say
 that
 we
 need


to
 continue
 investing
 across
 the
 entire


world
 simply
 because
 a
 this
 is
 the


opportunity
 of
 lifetime
 with
 AI.
 B
 the


one
 big
 beautiful
 bill
 is
 creating
 the


incentive
 for
 them
 to
 continue
 investing


and
 not
 stop
 in
 any
 meaningful
 way.
 On


top
 of
 that,
 you
 know,
 the
 other
 thing


that
 we're
 seeing
 from
 from
 these
 tech


companies
 is
 the
 continued
 focus
 on


where
 their
 margins
 can
 enhance.
 Ed


Yardani
 came
 out
 yesterday.
 I
 really
 was


surprised
 by
 his
 take.
 He's
 been


analyzing
 the
 stock
 market
 for
 like
 40


years
 now.
 He
 said
 go
 underweight
 the


MAG
 7
 for
 2026.


And
 my
 gut
 reaction
 is
 I
 disagree.
 I
 I


was
 very
 surprised
 that
 he
 said
 that.
 I


think
 the
 reason
 he
 came
 out
 and
 said


that
 was
 well
 there's
 two
 reasons.
 the
 s


the
 the
 the the
 more
 obvious
 reason
 is


that
 the
 Max
 7
 have
 run
 too
 much
 in
 that


you
 you
 know
 you
 need
 a
 new
 idea
 and


that
 new
 idea
 uh
 likely
 will
 outperform


the
 Max
 7
 although
 Amazon's
 up
 like
 1%


year
 to
 date.
 So
 I'm
 like
 you
 know
 meta


barely
 up
 now
 after
 the
 fall
 like
 I


still
 think
 the
 rich
 get
 richer
 in
 that


thesis
 is
 is
 is
 very
 intact.
 The
 more


cynical
 reason
 why
 I
 think
 he
 came
 out


and
 said
 that
 quite
 frankly
 is
 just
 for


attention.
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 when
 you're


an
 analyst,
 you
 need
 new
 ideas
 to
 to
 get


people
 to
 get
 excited
 about
 you.
 And
 Ed


Yardani
 is
 someone
 I
 respect
 very


deeply.
 So,
 it
 left
 me
 wondering.
 It's


like,
 dude,
 you've
 been
 bullish
 these


names
 for
 the
 past
 seven
 years
 now.
 2026


is
 the
 year
 to
 get
 bearish
 when
 we're


about
 to
 see
 the
 ROI
 from
 all
 their


capex.
 I
 mean,
 like,
 why
 else
 would
 you


come
 out
 with
 this
 take
 that
 says,
 "Oh,


go
 underweight
 the
 MAG
 7
 and
 go
 long
 the


S&P
 493."
 It's
 like
 we
 know
 the
 S&P
 4


and
 93
 don't
 have
 the
 balance
 sheets,


don't
 have
 the
 buybacks,
 don't
 have
 the


net
 income,
 don't
 have
 the
 free
 cash


flow,
 they
 don't
 have
 anything
 that
 the


MAX
 7
 have.
 They're
 good
 companies,
 but


they're
 not
 the
 MAX
 7.
 So,
 it
 was
 just


very,
 very
 weird
 that
 you
 had
 some


prominent
 people
 coming
 out.
 And
 I
 think


because
 of
 his
 influence
 in
 the


investing
 community,
 you're
 going to
 get


a
 lot
 of
 people
 just
 like
 you
 had
 at
 the


end
 of
 2024
 say
 the
 next
 year's
 trade


will
 not
 be
 the
 MAG7
 because
 they're


looking,
 you
 know,
 last
 year
 was
 small


caps,
 which
 small
 caps
 have
 done
 well,


but
 you
 know,
 the
 MAG7
 haven't
 done


horrible
 this
 year.
 Um,
 especially
 if


you
 bought
 at
 the
 April
 lows.
 And
 so
 I
 I


think
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 more


people
 trying
 to
 look
 for
 that
 new
 idea.


I
 continue
 to
 believe
 the
 best
 idea
 is


still
 the
 Mac
 7.
 And
 I
 reserve
 the
 right


to
 change
 that
 opinion
 as
 we
 get
 towards


the
 end
 of the
 year.
 trying
 to
 look
 deep


into
 Ed's
 thesis
 and
 see
 is
 there


something
 really
 serious
 that
 he's


talking
 about
 that
 should
 concern
 people


around
 the
 Mac
 7.
 But
 every
 time
 you


actually
 take
 that
 argument
 seriously,


you
 just
 go
 back
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 it's


the
 Mac
 7
 and
 it
 looks
 like
 they're
 not


going to
 be
 slowing
 down
 anytime
 soon.


All
 right,
 we
 got
 10
 seconds
 until
 the


market
 opens.
 Last
 thing
 before
 we
 open


up
 the
 markets,
 this
 is
 our
 president
 on


how
 the
 economy
 is
 doing
 in
 the
 United


States
 of
 America.


>> Pretty
 good.
 But
 I
 do
 want
 to
 talk
 about


the
 economy,
 sir,
 here
 at
 home.
 And
 and


I
 I
 wonder
 what
 grade
 you
 would
 give
 a


economy.


>> A+
 A+
 plus.


>> Well,
 it's
 interesting.


>> Pretty
 good.


>> All
 right.
 The
 stock
 market,
 thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here,


>> is
 now
 open.


with
 an
 A++
 plus
 bell
 as
 we
 are
 back
 for


the
 market
 open.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for


being
 here
 and
 again
 I'm
 sorry
 for


missing
 it
 yesterday.
 Thank
 you
 everyone


who
 reached
 out
 with
 all
 the
 messages
 to


get
 well
 better.
 Really
 really
 meant
 a


lot.
 Um
 happy
 to
 be
 back
 and
 happy
 to


open
 up
 this
 market.
 All
 right
 let's
 get


into
 it.
 Nvidia
 18497
 that's
 down
 about


31%
 on
 the
 day.
 Nvidia
 got
 some
 good


news
 after
 hours
 yesterday.
 Markets


really
 not
 giving
 it
 any
 what
 premium


got
 up
 to
 190
 after
 hours
 but
 still


getting
 hit.
 Grab
 2%
 down.
 I
 really


think
 this
 is
 stupid.
 508.
 If
 it
 goes


below
 $5,
 it
 would
 be
 quite
 interesting


to
 me
 right
 here.
 But
 that's
 down
 1.45%.


I
 do
 think
 the
 shorts
 are
 more
 in


control
 of
 the
 stock
 now
 as
 well
 as
 the


stock
 is
 getting
 hit
 and
 it's
 basically


been
 getting
 hit
 for
 the
 past
 month.
 The


Q's
 are
 down
 about
 0.27%.
 Nebi
 is
 down


3%
 right
 here.
 INE
 still
 down
 about
 2%


on
 the
 day.
 Rocket
 Lab
 Rocket
 Lab


breaking
 50
 yesterday
 was
 really


important.
 We
 had
 an
 update
 this
 morning


on
 Rocket
 Lab
 uh
 around
 their
 hungry


hippo
 initiative
 which
 ended
 up
 getting


them
 clearer
 a
 much
 clearer
 path
 to
 the


neutron
 launch.
 So
 we'll
 talk
 more
 about


that
 in
 a
 second,
 but
 that
 was
 the


update
 this
 morning
 and
 that's
 why
 that


stock
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of a
 boost
 in
 the


pre-market.
 Carvana,
 which
 is
 now
 in
 the


S&P
 500,
 that's
 down
 about
 1.5%.
 This
 is


outperforming
 all
 of
 the
 Max
 7.
 Speaking


of
 names
 that
 are
 outperforming
 the
 Max


7,
 Carvana
 has
 outperformed
 all
 of
 them


by
 two
 to
 10x
 over
 the
 past
 5
 years.
 So


that
 name
 has
 just
 been
 pretty


incredible.
 Dualingo
 right
 there.
 Wow,


back
 above
 200.
 I
 didn't
 even
 see
 that


yesterday.
 Okay,
 so
 Dolingo
 hit
 210


right
 now
 at
 203.
 BMR
 3474
 that's
 down


3%.
 Pouncer
 did
 hit
 184
 that's
 down
 to


180.
 Is
 Meta
 getting
 hit?
 Meta
 is


getting
 hit
 down
 1%.
 Hit
 675
 yesterday.


Not
 sure
 why
 it's
 down
 1%
 right
 here.


They
 came
 out
 with
 that
 news
 about
 the


Frontier
 model
 or
 at least
 Bloomberg
 is


reporting
 a
 Frontier
 model
 potentially


by
 Meta.
 Not
 sure
 why
 that's
 bearish,


but
 the
 street
 doesn't
 like
 it.
 Nvidia


still
 down
 about
 1%.
 S&P
 down
 0.08.
 SoFi


down
 1.3.
 SoFi,
 unfortunately,
 did
 not


make
 the
 S&P
 500.
 Next
 year,
 most
 likely


will
 happen
 for
 SoFi
 and
 Reddit,
 but


this
 year
 was
 not
 the
 chance
 for
 it.
 Red


right
 there,
 232,
 that's
 down
 about


1.3%.
 Amazon
 as
 well,
 just
 like
 Grab,
 I


think
 some
 of
 the
 price
 action
 on
 this


stuff
 is
 really,
 really
 ridiculous.
 I


think
 there's
 no
 reason
 for
 Amazon
 to
 be


trading
 at
 these
 levels.
 I
 really
 don't.


And
 uh
 sometimes
 buying
 up
 the
 beatup


names
 going
 into
 next
 year,
 you
 know,
 is


the
 way
 that
 you
 get
 some
 more


asymmetric
 returns.
 Even
 though
 it
 sucks


to
 buy
 them
 in
 the
 short
 term,
 Amazon


should
 not
 be
 at
 $225
 after
 those


earnings.
 But
 nonetheless,
 that
 one's


getting
 hit
 from
 260
 last
 week
 or
 or
 two


weeks
 ago.
 Nebia's
 right.
 They're
 at


9750.
 That's
 still
 down
 2.8.
 Robin
 Hood


134.
 If
 we
 hold
 up
 the
 130s,
 I
 will
 be


very
 happy
 to
 end
 the
 year.
 Robin
 Hood


is
 entering
 Indonesia
 as
 they've


acquired
 a
 new
 brokerage,
 which
 I
 think


is
 super
 super
 bullish.
 They're
 not


entering
 Singapore
 towards
 the
 end
 of


the
 year.
 You
 know,
 they
 said
 in
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 year
 they
 would
 be


entering
 Singapore.
 I
 guess
 whatever


deal
 they
 had
 for
 Singapore
 didn't
 go


through,
 but
 they
 are
 still
 expanding


globally.
 That
 was
 the
 one
 thing
 I


didn't
 know
 if
 Vlad
 would
 actually
 be


able
 to
 get
 done
 by
 the
 end
 of
 2025.
 And


it
 looks
 like
 they
 are
 making
 that


happen.
 Singapore
 is
 not
 happening,
 but


Indonesia
 will
 be
 happening
 as
 they


acquired
 a
 brokerage
 going
 into
 the
 end


of
 2025.
 So,
 it
 seems
 like
 they're
 going


to
 get
 another
 20
 million
 customers


going
 into
 2026.
 Pounder
 right
 there
 at


180
 BitMine
 at
 34.84.
 Where
 is
 Oscar?


Oscar's
 at
 1683.
 That
 one's
 actually
 up


a
 little
 bit
 on
 the
 day.
 Most
 stocks
 are


red.
 Insurance
 names
 are
 getting
 a


little
 bit
 of
 safety
 today.
 Amcor
 at


4550
 yesterday.
 Amcor
 back
 at
 44.
 Even


holding
 the
 40s,
 I
 think,
 is
 incredible


for
 Amcort.
 Tesla
 also
 holding
 the
 430s.


It's
 pretty
 cool.
 This
 was
 at
 450
 last


week.
 Eli
 Liy's
 up.
 ELF
 is
 up
 a
 little


bit.
 GM
 and
 Ford
 are
 up.
 Microsoft


trying
 to
 get
 back
 up
 to
 490,
 which
 is


nice.
 This
 was
 at
 465
 last
 week
 after


that
 report
 from
 the
 information.


Applovin,
 look
 at
 that.
 Trying
 to
 get


back
 up
 to
 700o.


is
 not
 too
 horrible.
 Rubric
 uh
 did
 have


amazing
 earnings.
 If
 you
 bought
 this


thing
 back
 at
 70,
 you've
 done
 very
 well.


90.41.
 Adobe's
 been
 having
 a
 hell
 of
 a


week.
 Uh
 tomorrow
 is
 going
 to
 be
 very


important
 for
 their
 earnings.
 Same
 thing


with
 Oracle,
 which
 is
 now
 at
 220.
 Oracle


got
 all
 the
 way
 to
 185.
 I
 feel
 like


Oracle
 is
 going
 to
 pop
 on
 earnings


because
 they're
 going
 to
 increase
 their


RPO
 estimates
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 have


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 OpenAI
 and
 they're


just
 going
 to
 show
 increased
 cloud


computing
 demand
 from
 another
 AI
 model


that's
 paying
 them.
 maybe
 anthropic,
 but


I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 enough
 to
 take
 an


earnings
 play
 on
 Oracle
 just
 given
 the


fear
 of
 of of
 their
 debt.
 That's


definitely
 getting
 people
 a
 bit
 more


scared
 about
 their
 their
 spending


commitments.
 Cipher
 right
 there,
 that's


up
 1.2%.
 Terowolf's
 up
 a
 little bit.
 Big


Bear
 is
 down
 about
 1.4.
 Uh
 the
 Quantum


names
 have
 had
 a
 pretty
 good
 recovery.


D-Wave
 was
 almost
 I
 think
 below
 like
 $18


two
 weeks
 ago.
 Now
 back
 to
 27.
 So
 that


one's
 down
 2%
 on
 the
 day,
 but
 still


green


um
 over
 the
 past
 week.
 And
 then
 Walmart


is
 replacing
 their
 CEO.
 That
 stock
 11363


basically
 at
 an
 all-time
 high.
 $95


billion
 market
 cap
 on
 Walmart.
 116
 was


the
 alltime
 high.
 So
 they're
 trading


just
 below
 that
 at
 113


on
 the
 day.
 Uh
 over
 Kaser
 says,
 "I'm


Indonesian.
 Hood.
 We'll
 be
 getting
 a
 lot


of
 money
 here
 through
 crypto.
 A
 lot
 of


Indian
 Indonesian
 people
 trade
 crypto."


Yeah,
 Indonesia's
 population
 is
 greater


than
 the
 United
 States,
 which
 is
 crazy.


And
 crypto
 in
 Southeast
 Asia,
 especially


in
 Indonesia,
 from
 some
 of
 the
 research


I
 did
 over
 the
 weekend
 when
 this
 was


announced
 on
 Sunday
 night,
 is
 a
 big


deal.
 And
 you
 can
 understand
 why,
 right?


Local
 currencies
 are
 not
 necessarily
 the


easiest
 to
 trade,
 definitely
 not
 the


easiest
 to
 transact
 different
 uh


business
 deals
 in.
 And
 so
 crypto
 ends
 up


becoming
 a
 an
 alternative.
 So
 I
 think


from
 that
 perspective,
 it
 makes
 a
 lot
 of


sense
 for
 Hood
 to
 go
 to
 Indonesia.
 And


they're
 going
 to
 be
 capturing
 19
 million


customers
 as
 per
 the
 the
 brokerage
 that


they
 acquired.
 This
 should
 be
 adding
 a


lot
 more
 to
 the
 overall
 assets
 under


custody.
 Meta
 getting
 hit
 right
 here.


Down
 2%.
 657


on
 Meta.


657
 on
 Meta.
 Oh,
 you're
 right.


Indonesia's
 280
 million.
 Yeah.
 Yeah,


you're
 right.
 America's
 330.
 I
 thought


Indonesia
 was
 350
 million.
 Yeah,
 you're


right.
 280
 million.
 Um,
 still
 rivaling


the
 size.
 283
 million
 in
 Indonesia.


United
 States
 at
 330.
 I
 mean,
 rivaling


the
 size
 of
 the
 United
 States.
 So,
 I


think
 it's
 a
 mass
 mass
 market


that
 Robinood


is
 meaningfully
 going
 after.
 I'm
 just


happy
 they
 followed
 through
 with
 their


international
 commitments
 by
 the
 end
 of


the
 year.
 So,
 I
 didn't
 think
 they
 were


going
 to
 just
 because
 they've
 been


working
 on
 so
 many
 different,
 you
 know,


companies
 say
 stuff,
 but
 sometimes
 they


don't
 follow
 through
 on
 it.
 Uh,
 and
 I


wouldn't
 have
 given
 them
 any
 flak
 if


they
 didn't
 because
 they've
 done
 so
 much


this
 year.
 The
 fact
 that
 they
 actually


came
 through
 at
 the
 end
 of
 December
 and


said,
 "Nope,
 we
 are
 still
 expanding


internationally
 I
 thought
 was
 pretty


impressive."
 S&P
 going
 green
 slightly
 on


the
 day
 68360.


Google
 at
 312,
 that's
 down
 about.3%.


Reddit's
 still
 down
 1.4.
 Netflix
 getting


a
 little
 bit
 little
 bit
 of
 green


basically
 flat
 at
 9670.
 Where's
 Bitcoin?


I
 haven't
 looked
 at
 Bitcoin
 honestly
 for


like
 the
 past
 two
 days.
 90.
 Okay.


I'd
 uh
 I'd
 rather
 it
 be
 90
 than
 back
 in


the
 low
 80s.
 It
 peaked
 at
 93
 I
 think


last
 Friday.
 90,500


on
 Bitcoin.
 Galaxy
 did
 get
 a
 $60
 price


target
 by
 our
 boy
 Devin
 Ryan.
 I
 didn't


expect
 that.
 Uh
 Devin
 Ryan
 is
 an
 analyst


I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 respect
 for.
 I
 didn't


read
 his
 report
 yet.
 I
 have
 his
 report.


I
 have
 to
 go
 through
 it.
 But
 60
 bucks,
 I


guess
 his
 uh
 AI
 HBC


choice
 out
 of
 all
 the
 Bitcoin
 miners
 was


Galaxy.
 So
 Galaxy
 right
 there
 up
 3.12%


with
 a
 $60
 target


from
 Mr.
 Mr.
 Devon
 Ryan.


Does
 Hood
 need
 legislation
 in
 Indonesia


for
 crypto
 sales?
 Honestly,
 I
 have
 no


idea.
 I
 I
 I've
 not
 gone
 through
 the


acquisition
 in
 such
 depth,
 but
 I'm
 sure


whatever
 legislation
 or,
 you
 know,


regulations
 they
 need
 to
 get
 done,
 they


probably
 thought
 about
 it
 for
 a
 long


time.
 I
 just
 think
 getting
 the


international
 expansion
 opens
 up
 the


floodgates
 for
 expanding


internationally.
 Like
 once
 you
 get
 it
 in


one
 part
 of
 a
 region,
 they
 can
 hopefully


get
 it
 in
 other
 parts
 of the
 region.
 So


question
 is
 just
 how
 fast
 now
 will
 they


be
 able
 to
 get
 this
 done?
 I
 ran
 right


here.
 They
 did
 their
 capital
 raise
 a


couple
 weeks
 ago.
 Street
 didn't
 like
 it


initially.
 fell
 below
 40
 for
 a
 hot


second,
 right
 back
 to
 46.
 Seems
 like
 the


street
 is
 kind
 of
 okay
 with
 them
 raising


about
 $2
 billion
 right
 here.
 Nebia
 still


down
 about
 2.4.
 Nebas
 acquired
 some
 land


today.
 Um,


where
 did
 they
 acquire
 it?
 They
 acquired


it
 in


uh,
 Missouri,


398
 acres.
 It's
 an
 AI
 data
 center
 campus


that
 could
 scale
 to
 8
 to
 10
 buildings


and
 deliver
 800
 megawatts
 of
 capacity.


This
 will
 be
 the
 first
 data
 center
 in


the
 US
 than
 Nebas
 fully
 built
 and


operates
 itself.


So
 they
 officially
 acquired
 some
 more


land
 in
 Missouri
 along
 with
 New
 Jersey.


398
 acres


which
 was
 announced


this
 morning.
 ONQ
 that's
 back
 at
 54.


This
 thing
 was
 wasn't
 this
 thing
 like


below
 30
 or
 something?


This
 thing
 got
 to
 No,
 it
 got
 to
 38
 in


November.


Like
 even
 names
 that
 really
 don't
 have


massive
 massive
 like
 growth
 or
 earnings,


they've
 recovered
 with
 the
 market.
 Not


to
 their
 all-time
 highs,
 but
 they've


still
 recovered
 pretty
 decently.
 And
 so


you
 see
 you're
 seeing
 a
 decent
 level
 of


breath
 and
 consolidation
 that's
 been


happening
 that's
 not
 been
 horrible
 to


see.
 AMD
 right
 there
 at
 220
 and
 then


Nvidia


at
 18479.


Charlie
 says,
 "I'm
 in
 Missouri.
 We
 got


data
 center
 spots
 all
 over."
 The
 big


beautiful
 bill
 really
 did
 incentivize


the
 building
 of
 data
 centers
 at
 scale.


Um
 especially
 with
 the
 zoning
 law


changes
 they
 made.
 So
 it
 makes
 sense


that
 Missouri
 is
 getting
 that.
 Hasset
 is


live.
 Okay,
 let's
 go
 to
 Hasset
 who


likely
 is
 going
 to
 be
 our
 next
 Fed


chair.
 We'll
 see
 if
 Trump
 announces
 that


by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 or
 not,


but
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 one.
 Uh
 I


don't
 see
 Hasset
 live.
 I
 know
 he
 was


live
 yesterday.


Don't
 see
 him
 live
 right
 now,
 but
 when


we
 do
 see
 him,
 we'll
 pull
 it
 up
 and
 see


what
 he
 is
 saying.
 The
 10ear,
 by
 the


way,
 is


where
 are
 we
 at?
 4.153.
 So,
 that
 one's


still
 a
 little
 aggressive
 above
 4%.
 Not


something
 we
 want
 to
 see
 on
 the
 10ear.


4.153.


This
 thing
 was
 freaking
 below
 4%
 a


couple
 weeks
 ago.
 So,
 the
 credit


market's
 definitely
 saying,
 "Hey,
 not


too
 fast."
 The
 thing
 about
 the
 the


10-year,
 which
 is
 annoying,
 is
 that
 the


rate
 cuts
 have
 not
 officially
 come
 down


or
 sorry,
 the
 rate
 cuts
 have
 happened,


but
 the
 the
 the
 rates
 have
 not


meaningfully
 come
 down,
 interest
 rates.


So,
 it's
 like
 the
 yields
 aren't


reflecting


the
 10-year.
 The
 10-year
 yield
 is
 not


reflecting
 interest
 rates
 coming
 down.


And
 that
 just
 shows
 a
 lack
 of
 confidence


from
 investors
 to
 actually
 buy
 up
 bonds


even
 though
 the
 Fed
 is
 is
 lowering


rates.
 This
 was
 the
 Rocket
 Lab
 headline.


Rocket
 Lab
 clears
 significant
 milestone


on
 its
 path
 to
 its
 first
 neutron
 launch


launch
 on
 uh
 Rocket
 Lab's
 neutron
 launch


vehicles
 innovative
 Hungry
 Hippoto


captive
 fairing
 has
 successfully


completed
 qualification
 testing
 and
 is


on
 route
 to
 Virginia
 for
 Neutron's
 first


launch.
 Hungry
 Hippo
 is
 a
 captive


payload
 fairing
 that
 stays
 attached
 to


the
 rocket's
 first
 stage
 through
 launch


and
 landing.
 Instead
 of
 dropping
 its


fairing
 like
 traditional
 rockets,


Neutron
 opens
 the
 halves
 to
 to
 deploy


the
 second
 stage
 and
 payload.


So
 that
 is
 uh
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 reasons


Rocket
 Lab
 got
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 a
 boost
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 5124
 almost
 hitting
 52


right
 here


as
 Neutron
 becomes
 closer
 than
 expected.


What
 is
 wrong
 with
 SoFi,
 dude?
 Almost


below
 27.
 Yes,
 I
 do
 think
 we're
 getting


jolts
 today.
 Let
 me
 make
 sure.
 But
 I


think
 in
 about
 18
 minutes
 we
 should
 be


getting
 jolts
 which
 also
 could
 be
 the


reason
 the
 market
 is
 waiting
 for
 some


data.
 Yes,
 in
 about
 18
 minutes
 we
 will


get
 jolts.
 Probably
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be


the
 best.
 Well,
 the
 jolts
 is
 for


September
 though.
 Oh
 no,
 we
 get
 up


September
 and
 October,
 right?


Okay,
 we're
 definitely
 getting


September.
 It
 says
 we're
 going
 to
 get


October.
 I
 don't
 know if
 we're
 actually


getting
 October.
 We're
 not
 getting
 PPI


for
 October.
 The
 BLS
 came
 out
 yesterday


said
 no
 PPI
 for
 October.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 you


can't
 have
 inflation
 if
 they
 don't
 give


us
 the
 data.
 So,
 I
 wonder
 if
 we're
 going


to
 get
 jolts
 for
 October.
 So
 far,
 right


there,
 2710


down
 1.8%.
 Jolts
 are
 job
 openings


in
 America.
 So,
 how
 many
 jobs
 are
 open?


And
 then,
 you
 know,
 the
 Fed
 can
 kind
 of


make
 a
 decision
 on
 if
 there's
 less
 jobs


open,
 should
 we
 be
 easing
 monetary


policy
 to
 stimulate
 the
 economy
 to


incentivize
 employers
 to
 hire
 more?


We're
 robbing
 it
 right
 there
 at
 13560


down.36%.
 SoFi
 did
 complete
 its
 dilution


yesterday,
 but
 that
 news
 was
 pretty


baked
 in
 for
 the
 past
 72
 hours.
 So,
 and


there
 they
 completed
 the
 dilution
 at


2750.
 By
 the
 way,
 shout
 out
 to
 uh
 data


driven
 investing.
 He
 got
 a
 job
 at
 SoFi,


which
 is
 absolutely
 crazy.
 I
 mean,
 that


is
 so
 cool.
 He's
 going to
 be
 working
 for


the
 office
 of
 the
 CFO.
 So,


unfortunately,
 he
 will
 have
 to
 shut
 down


his
 uh
 Twitter
 account
 and
 YouTube


account,
 but
 um
 and
 he
 won't
 be
 able
 to


talk
 about
 the
 stock
 anymore.
 But
 that's


super
 cool,
 dude.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 I
 did
 not


expect
 SoFi
 to
 actually
 reach
 out
 to
 a


retail
 investor.
 And
 for
 anyone
 who's


followed
 Data
 Driven's
 work,
 I
 mean,
 his


analysis
 on
 SoFi's
 financials
 is
 like
 I


mean,
 I
 I
 have
 not
 seen
 anyone
 analyze


the
 numbers
 the
 way
 he
 has.
 And
 he
 has
 a


legit
 job
 at
 the
 company,
 which
 is


crazy.
 So
 unfortunately
 we
 are
 losing
 a


really
 really
 prominent
 voice
 in
 the


retail
 investor.
 Part
 part
 of
 the
 reason


I
 bought
 SoFi
 years
 ago
 or
 even
 continue


to
 hold
 SoFi
 is
 because
 of
 his
 analysis


and
 so
 unfortunately
 he's
 leaving
 the


retail
 investor
 community.
 But
 super


awesome
 for
 him
 to
 actually
 get
 a
 job


at
 the
 uh
 at
 the
 company.
 This
 proves


there
 are
 some
 jobs
 out
 there.
 That
 is


true.
 This
 does
 prove
 there
 are
 some


some
 jobs
 out
 there.


He
 leaked
 too
 much,
 so
 they
 decided
 to


keep
 him
 in
 SoFi.
 You
 know,
 I
 I
 I
 can't


imagine
 that's
 not
 one
 of
 the
 things


they
 thought
 about.
 It's
 like,
 dude,


this
 guy
 is
 analyzing
 our
 business
 so


well,
 we
 might
 as
 well
 just
 bring
 him
 in


the
 company,


navigate
 it
 like
 that.
 Uh,
 we
 do
 have
 a


quote
 from
 Hasset.
 Hasset
 responds
 to
 a


question
 on
 how
 low
 the
 Fed
 should
 take


rates.
 He
 says,
 "Must
 recognize
 this
 is


a
 transformative
 time
 like
 the
 1990s.
 AI


is
 bigger
 than
 the
 computer
 for


productivity."


So
 you've
 got
 Hassets
 once
 again
 arguing


that
 we
 need
 to
 get
 these
 rates
 to
 come


down.
 By
 the
 way,
 October
 saw
 153,000


job
 cuts,
 the
 worst
 October
 in
 22
 years.


And
 through
 October,
 we
 have
 1.09


million
 layoffs.
 This
 is
 a
 65%
 jump
 from


last
 year,
 and
 it's
 the
 highest
 since


2020.


So
 again,
 that's
 your
 bullcase
 for
 a


rate
 cut.
 When
 you
 see
 numbers
 like


that,
 it's
 unlikely


for
 us
 to
 not
 get
 a
 rate
 cut.
 When
 you


see
 the
 labor
 market
 start
 to
 weaken
 in


the
 way
 that
 it's
 weakening,
 89.4%


chance


89.4%
 chance
 to
 potentially
 get
 that


rake
 up.


Didn't
 you
 and
 DDI
 go
 back
 and
 forth


with
 each
 other?
 Yes.
 I
 look,
 I
 think
 we


had
 some
 healthy
 intellectual
 debates
 on


Robin
 and
 SoFi.
 Um,
 ultimately
 I
 still


think
 he
 doesn't
 fully
 understand
 the


Robinet
 thesis.
 And
 maybe
 he
 thinks
 I


don't
 fully
 understand
 the
 SoFi
 thesis,


but
 those
 are
 healthy
 debates.
 You
 know,


those
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 a
 public


figure
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 analyzing


stocks,
 it's
 fun
 to
 have
 those
 debates.


Nonetheless,
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 respect
 for


the
 guy.
 I
 just
 disagree
 with
 him
 on


some
 of
 the
 ways
 he
 philosophically


thinks
 about
 Robin
 Hood
 as
 a
 company.


But
 I
 just
 think
 it's
 a
 big
 win
 for


retail
 for
 someone
 to
 get
 a
 job
 at
 that


high.
 The
 office
 of
 the
 CFO
 is
 no
 is
 a


big
 deal.
 like
 to
 be
 directly
 under
 the


chief
 financial
 officer
 of
 a
 fast


growing
 company
 like
 SoFi
 and
 to
 be


meaningfully
 contributing
 that's
 a


really
 big
 deal.
 So
 I'm
 very
 very
 happy


that
 he
 got
 that
 job
 and
 I
 do
 think
 it's


going
 to
 be
 really
 good.
 It
 makes
 me


more
 bullish
 for
 SoFi
 quite
 frankly.
 Why


is
 Meta
 continually
 getting
 hit
 today


bro?
 1.7%
 down


on
 the
 news
 that
 they're
 releasing
 a
 new


model
 in
 2026.
 Is
 the
 market
 like


bearish
 that
 they're
 releasing
 a
 model?


Isn't
 doesn't
 the
 market
 want
 them
 to


release
 a
 model?


That's
 weird.
 Spy
 goes
 green.
 Hoodie


about
 to
 go
 green.
 13641
 trying
 to
 break


137.
 Galaxy
 up
 4%
 on
 the
 day.
 Rocket
 Lab


very
 close
 to
 going
 green
 as
 well.


And
 Meta


is
 still
 down.
 Oh
 yeah,
 the
 Google


glasses.
 I
 forgot
 about
 that.
 I
 saw
 that


in
 the
 morning.


That's
 a
 big
 deal.
 By
 the
 way,
 Accenture


partnered
 with
 Anthropic
 today
 to
 uh


train
 30,000
 consultants
 on
 how
 to
 use


AI.


So,
 you've
 got
 more
 and
 more
 uh
 AI
 tech


companies
 working
 with
 these
 consulting


firms
 to
 work
 together.
 Yeah.
 So,
 Google


Glasses
 essentially
 Google's
 coming
 out


with
 a
 competitor
 to
 Ray-B
 bands.
 Meta


Ray-B
 bands.
 I
 mean,
 Google
 has
 tried


glasses
 in
 the
 past,
 but
 this
 one
 seems


like
 a
 a
 legit
 a
 more
 legit
 competitor.


Could
 that
 actually
 be
 the
 reason,


though?


Google
 says
 their
 first
 AI
 glasses
 will


arrive
 next
 year.
 They
 did
 demo
 this


stuff
 back
 at
 this
 uh
 the
 the
 Google
 IO


event,
 I
 think
 in
 July.
 This
 is
 when
 the


stock
 was
 at
 like
 140.


Uh
 2026


looks
 like
 when
 it's
 going
 to
 come
 out.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 this
 is
 really
 a
 bare


case
 for
 Meta
 though,
 dude.
 Like,
 like,


first
 of
 all,
 glasses
 as
 an
 industry
 is


not
 that
 big.
 So,
 it's
 not
 like
 Meta
 has


this
 massive
 market
 share
 that's
 going


to
 be
 destroyed
 by
 Google.
 And
 even
 if


it
 is,
 who
 cares?
 Like,
 yeah,
 it's
 not


like
 Meta
 is
 selling
 that
 many
 glasses.


So,
 if
 Google
 takes
 half
 of
 what
 they're


selling,
 it's
 like
 you're
 not
 buying


Meta
 for
 the
 glasses
 right
 here.
 But,


nonetheless,
 the
 street
 probably
 will


react
 to
 that.
 Hims
 right
 here
 finally


getting
 back
 above
 40,
 which
 is
 nice
 to


see.
 That's
 up
 3.3%.


Um,


is
 that
 one
 holding
 on
 to
 a
 little
 bit


of
 green?
 Uh,
 the
 the
 rapper
 that
 I
 had


on
 the
 stream
 yesterday,
 24K
 Golden,
 he


he
 likes
 him
 a
 lot
 and
 he
 thinks
 it's


like
 a
 legit
 product
 uh
 or
 a
 legit


solution
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people,
 especially


in
 the
 context
 of
 hair
 loss,
 which
 which


again
 is
 a
 real
 thesis
 for
 him.
 It's


just
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 credit
 card
 data


coming
 out
 by
 all
 these
 banks
 and


they're
 looking
 at
 it
 and
 they're
 saying


Q3
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 that
 good.
 They


missed
 on
 EPS
 by
 40%
 less.
 A
 lot
 of
 the


excitement
 and
 momentum
 on
 hims
 has
 died


down,
 but
 the
 long-term
 thesis,
 this


like
 Netflix
 of
 healthcare
 is
 not
 really


gone.
 That
 thesis
 is
 still
 very
 much


alive.
 It's
 just,
 you
 know,
 the
 past


couple
 quarters
 have
 not
 been
 the
 most


exciting.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know if
 this
 thing


gets
 back
 to
 70
 anytime
 soon,
 but
 still,


even
 with
 the
 decline
 from
 70,
 it's
 up


60%
 year
 to
 date.


Can't
 be
 too
 upset


about
 uh
 about
 that
 stock
 price


performance.
 Galaxy
 right
 there
 up
 4%.


Bitcoin
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 move


above
 90
 and
 then
 Doby
 at
 340
 as
 well.


Oh,
 Hasset's
 talking
 at
 the
 Wall
 Street


Journal


conference.
 Uh,
 okay.
 So,
 Kevin
 Hasset


at
 the
 conference
 has
 asked
 how
 low


rates
 should
 go.
 Uh,
 he
 says,
 "What
 we


have
 to
 do
 is
 recognize
 that
 we're
 in


the
 90s.
 We
 are
 in
 a
 potentially


extremely
 transformative
 time.
 Um,
 you


have
 to
 watch
 and
 make
 sure
 inflation


doesn't
 take
 off."
 Someone
 says,
 "How


much
 lower?"
 He
 says,
 "You
 have
 to


watch."
 He
 says,
 "There's
 plenty
 of
 room


to
 cut
 rates."
 Someone
 says,
 'What
 would


you
 do
 if
 Trump
 wanted
 you
 to
 cut
 rates


and
 you
 didn't
 think
 it
 was
 the
 right


thing
 to
 do?
 He
 says,
 'Well,
 if


inflation
 has
 gone
 from
 2.5
 to
 4%,
 then


you
 can't
 cut
 rates.


So,
 basically,
 he's
 saying,
 if
 I
 see
 a


meaningful
 increase
 in
 inflation,
 I


wouldn't
 cut
 rates,


but
 he's
 arguing
 that
 we're
 not
 seeing


that
 meaningful
 increase
 in
 inflation,


which
 I
 mean,
 he's
 right
 about.
 You're


seeing
 inflation
 go
 up,
 but
 it's
 not


going
 up
 that
 aggressively.
 Wow.
 Gold
 is


pushing
 60


or
 sorry,
 not
 gold,
 silver.
 Gold
 is
 back


at
 4,200.


Has
 silver
 ever
 ever
 broken
 60?
 I
 don't


think
 it
 has.


My
 goodness.
 5914
 up
 another
 2%


on
 the
 day.


The
 commodities
 trade
 not
 dying
 down.


Someone
 just
 sold
 8
 million
 of
 puts
 on


Tesla.
 Strike
 price
 430.
 That's
 bullish.


Again,
 when
 you're
 selling
 puts,
 it


means
 you're
 ready
 to
 buy
 those
 shares


at
 this
 strike
 price
 for
 January
 9th,


2026.


January
 9th,
 2026.


24K
 silver
 is
 my
 new
 rap
 name.


That's
 crazy,
 dude.


That's
 absolutely
 crazy.
 Silver,
 one
 of


the
 trades
 of
 the
 year.
 One
 of
 the


trades
 of
 the
 year.
 So
 far,
 starting
 to


recover
 a
 little
 bit.
 Robin
 Hood
 pushing


137
 right
 here.
 13670.
 They're
 going to


have an
 event
 on
 December
 16th
 around


prediction
 markets
 and
 AI.
 Again,
 I


think
 prediction
 markets
 I
 think
 people


are
 really
 underestimating
 how
 big
 the


TAM
 is
 for
 that
 industry.
 I
 think
 it's


going to
 keep
 growing
 and
 growing
 and


growing.
 Khi's
 like
 number
 one
 in
 the


entire
 app
 store.
 I
 think
 it's
 number


five
 in
 the
 app
 store.
 It's
 number
 one


in
 finance.
 Um
 I
 think
 it's
 going to
 be


a
 really
 big
 industry.
 Vlad
 did
 a
 great


job
 on
 the
 podcast
 with
 the
 compounding


friends
 and
 you
 know
 they
 talked
 about


prediction
 markets
 and
 there
 was
 just


like
 dude
 are
 are
 you
 seeing
 what
 we're


seeing
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 excitement
 for
 it


and
 he
 was
 unequivocally
 saying
 that


Robin
 Hood
 is
 seeing
 a
 behavioral
 change


in
 the
 type
 of
 demand
 that
 consumers
 are


engaging
 with
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 this


product
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 business
 is


a
 $300
 million
 run
 rate
 right right
 now


for
 them
 with
 three
 billion
 contracts


every
 month
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 only
 going


to
 be
 a
 bigger
 bigger
 business
 for
 them


over
 the
 coming
 year
 service
 now
 that's


at
 853
 they
 did
 approve
 move
 a
 five
 for


one
 stock
 split
 last
 week.
 Aries


Management,
 which
 is
 like
 a
 uh
 private


equity
 firm,
 they
 are
 getting
 into
 the


S&P
 500.


They
 are
 officially
 getting
 into
 the
 S&P


500
 that
 was
 announced
 yesterday
 as


well.


It
 didn't
 feel
 like
 Vlad
 liked
 the


Compound
 Guys
 that
 much.
 You
 know,
 I
 I


think
 he
 was
 I
 think
 he
 did
 had
 a
 really


good
 podcast.
 The
 problem
 with
 the


compound
 guys,
 and
 I've
 said
 this
 time


and
 time
 again,
 they
 don't
 let
 the


guests
 talk.
 Like,
 I
 love
 those
 guys.
 I


I
 listen
 to
 the
 podcast
 every
 week,
 but


they
 just
 don't
 shut
 up
 and
 let
 the


guests
 talk.
 They
 always
 like,
 if
 you're


going
 to
 interject,
 you've
 got
 to


interject
 and
 say
 something
 smart
 or
 say


something
 that
 adds
 value.
 They
 say


something
 that's
 just
 like,
 "Dude,
 like,


shut
 up.
 We're
 not
 at
 a
 bar
 drinking
 a


couple
 beers.
 Like,
 it's
 a
 podcast
 about


finance.
 Like,
 let
 the
 finance
 guest


talk."


It's
 Yeah,
 maybe
 it's
 the
 New
 York
 in


them,
 but
 it's
 really
 annoying,
 dude.


Like,
 you're
 just
 like
 you
 and
 I,
 you


know,
 I
 because
 I've
 interviewed
 Vlad
 a


couple
 times.
 One
 of
 the
 things
 I
 I


learned
 about
 him
 is
 that
 he
 takes
 a


long
 time
 to
 speak
 and
 you
 got
 to
 give


him
 the
 time
 to
 to
 let
 him
 present
 it.


He's
 a
 very
 slow
 talker,
 but
 if
 you
 ask


a
 good
 question,
 you'll
 get
 a
 good


response.
 And
 he's
 like
 midway
 trying
 to


get
 through
 his
 answer,
 and
 they'll


interrupt
 him.
 And
 you
 could
 tell
 he's


just
 like
 a
 little
 startled
 by
 it


because
 he
 wants
 to
 finish
 his
 freaking


answer.


And
 that's
 the
 most
 annoying
 part
 about


that
 podcast.


So,
 I
 think
 Vlad
 did
 a
 great
 job,
 but
 I


think
 they
 just
 have
 to
 let
 the
 guest


actually
 Yeah.
 Let
 him
 cook.
 Actually,


let
 him
 cook.
 All right.
 Who's
 Who's


long
 Oracle
 and
 Adobe
 going
 into
 this


week?
 I'm
 going
 to
 put
 a
 poll
 in
 the


chat.
 I
 asked
 this
 last
 time
 at
 this


exact
 same
 price
 on
 September
 8th
 and


Oracle
 went
 from
 220
 to
 350.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 that
 happens
 again.
 A
 couple
 of


you
 guys
 actually
 bought
 calls
 the
 day


before
 that
 and
 made
 some
 good
 money.


But
 I
 really
 wonder
 if
 the
 software


names
 show
 up
 for
 the
 for
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.


Long
 Oracle
 and
 Adobe


this
 week.
 Oracle
 Adobe


both
 or
 neither?


What
 do
 you
 think?
 Uh
 meetup
 details


will
 be
 coming
 out
 soon.
 Again,
 I'm


doing
 a
 stream
 with
 my
 new
 manager
 on


Friday.
 That'll
 be
 at
 uh
 700
 p.m.
 7:30


p.m.
 Eastern.
 So,
 we'll
 have
 some


details
 on
 the
 meetup
 uh
 on
 that
 stream.


But
 yeah,
 this
 weekend
 we'll
 have


details
 and
 then
 next
 week
 we'll
 have
 a


lot
 more
 details.
 But
 yes,
 New
 York


meetup
 is
 happening.
 Likely
 is
 happening


February
 1st
 over
 January
 25th
 because
 I


forgot
 the
 AFC
 Championship
 is
 on


January
 25th
 for
 football.
 So,
 probably


going
 to
 do
 it
 fe
 February
 1st,
 that


Sunday.


And
 yes,
 we'll
 have
 more
 details
 on
 this


going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 uh
 the
 end
 of


the
 week.
 Oracle
 is
 slightly
 flat.


Again,
 Nvidia's
 down
 because
 China
 came


out
 and
 said,
 "We
 don't
 want
 the
 H200s."


Basically,
 that's
 why
 Nvidia
 is
 down.


Otherwise,
 Nvidia
 would
 be
 at
 190.
 Um,


so
 Trump
 is
 willing
 to
 sell
 them
 or


Trump
 is
 letting
 Jensen
 sell
 them,
 but


China
 doesn't
 necessarily
 want
 them.
 Now


granted,
 I
 think
 China's
 gonna
 still
 get


some
 of
 them,
 which
 is
 net
 positive,
 but


the
 streets
 moving
 on
 that
 narrative,


and
 that's
 why
 I'm
 videoing
 right
 there


at
 183


is
 down
 on
 the
 day.
 Yes,
 we
 will
 do


technical
 Tuesday
 today
 as
 well.
 Jason


sent
 me
 a
 gift.
 By
 the
 way,
 I'm
 going
 to


show
 you
 guys
 on
 the
 stream
 on
 the


market
 close,
 but
 uh
 it's
 a
 pretty
 dope


gift.
 So,
 I
 will
 show
 you
 guys
 when
 I'm


live
 with
 Jason.
 It
 was
 super
 cool.
 Even


my
 mom
 saw
 it.
 She
 was
 like,
 "Wow,
 this


is
 amazing."
 So,
 shout
 out
 to
 Jason.
 But


I'll
 show
 you
 guys
 the
 gift
 once
 uh
 once


we
 go
 live
 today.
 S&P
 684,
 Iran
 at
 47,


then
 service
 now
 at
 858.
 All right,
 in
 5


minutes
 we're
 going to
 get
 jolts
 for


September.


Um,
 Crowd
 Strike
 is
 up
 as
 well.
 The


street
 is
 expecting
 7.2
 million.
 Wow,


Crowd
 Strike
 alltime
 highs.
 7.2
 million


jobs.
 Sorry,
 not
 alltime
 highs.
 550
 is


alltime
 highs,
 but
 525


is
 where
 we're
 at.
 Uh,
 right
 here.
 Kind


of
 like
 intrammon
 highs.
 Now,
 the
 thing


is,
 I
 don't
 know if
 this
 jolt
 is
 going


to
 matter
 that
 much.
 Oh,
 wow.


I
 just
 saw
 a
 tweet
 that
 I
 didn't
 expect


to
 see.


Wow.
 Okay,
 hold
 on.
 Let
 me
 show
 you
 guys


this
 uh
 real
 quick
 on
 Jolts.
 This
 is


September
 jobs
 report.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know


how
 much
 it's
 going to
 affect
 the
 data


because


like
 it's
 been
 two
 months
 since


September.
 So,
 we'll
 see
 if
 we
 get


October.
 As
 you
 can
 see
 right
 here,
 it


says
 October,
 but
 I
 don't
 know if
 we're


going to
 get
 it.
 September
 Street
 wants


7.2
 2
 million.
 But
 even
 if
 we
 come
 in


higher
 than
 expected,
 like
 does
 it
 show


a
 healthy
 job
 market
 if
 October,
 you


know,
 we
 had
 many
 layoffs
 and
 that
 could


have
 massively
 affected
 the
 job


openings?
 So,
 I
 mean,
 we're
 going
 to


have
 to
 see
 if
 the
 street
 really
 does


react
 to
 this.
 Um,
 yeah,
 this
 is
 the


tweet
 that
 I
 just
 saw.
 Some
 of
 you
 guys


just
 put
 it
 in
 the
 chat.
 Our
 boy
 Chris


Patel
 is
 long
 invidia.


Wow.


Did
 not
 expect
 to
 see
 that.
 While
 some


people
 may
 be
 waking
 up
 to
 the
 China


export
 of
 H200
 lift,
 but
 China
 not


wanting
 to
 buy
 and
 reversing
 some
 of
 the


gains.
 I'm
 seeing
 something
 different.


The
 president
 of
 the
 US
 knows
 what


Blackwell
 Reuben
 chips
 are.
 Dude
 is
 out


here
 tweeting
 about
 it
 and
 willing
 to


allow
 sales.
 Trump
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 things,


but
 the
 one
 thing
 he's
 really
 good
 at
 is


selling.
 Expect
 Nvidia
 to
 get
 a
 massive


boost
 in
 AI
 chip
 sales
 going
 forward,
 if


not
 directly
 from
 China,
 indirectly
 from


China.
 Also,
 another
 catalyst.
 Other


countries
 are
 likely
 to
 start
 a
 wave
 of


AI
 spend
 to
 not
 get
 left
 behind.
 Nvidia


chart
 is
 showing
 that
 they
 will
 clearly


break
 out
 in
 the
 next
 few
 months.


Okay,
 so
 we
 we


Chris,
 if
 you're
 in
 Chris,
 if
 you're
 in


the
 chat,
 let
 us
 know.
 We
 finally
 got


our
 boy


on
 the
 Nvidia
 train.


All
 right,
 I
 love
 it.
 I
 mean,
 I've
 been


waiting
 for
 this
 moment
 for
 a
 long
 time.


You
 know,
 I
 think
 Chris's
 biggest


concern
 about
 Nvidia
 has
 been
 the


cyclicality
 of
 of
 semiconductors,
 which


which
 is
 a
 fair
 critique,
 but
 given


Nvidia's
 earnings
 growth,
 I
 mean,
 you


kind
 of
 throw
 cyclicality
 out
 of
 the


window,
 unless
 you
 genuinely
 think
 AI
 is


fake
 and
 that
 everything's
 cyclical
 and


or
 not
 everything's
 cyclical,
 but
 that


the
 this
 current
 moment
 in
 time
 is
 so


unbelievably
 cyclical
 that
 they
 can't


grow
 at
 the
 level
 they're
 going
 to
 grow


at.
 I
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 inevitable
 that


this
 stock
 gets
 rerated
 much
 higher
 than


what
 it
 is
 today
 simply
 because
 the


earnings
 growth.
 It's
 just
 that
 simple.


the
 stock
 cannot
 be
 trading
 at
 23
 times


earnings
 going
 into
 next.
 It's
 just


going
 to
 be
 too
 cheap,
 especially
 if


we're
 in
 a
 bull
 market.


So,


I
 think
 it
 makes
 sense.
 And
 the
 Trump


angle
 also
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.
 I
 mean,


again,
 the
 fact
 that
 Trump
 doesn't
 want


to
 sell
 Black
 Wall
 and
 Reuben
 to
 our


adversaries
 means
 that
 he
 understands


how
 valuable
 those
 ships
 are.
 If
 you


believe
 Jensen
 on
 the
 $500
 billion


guidance,
 you
 believe
 the
 beat
 and
 raise


cycle
 that
 Nvidia
 has
 been
 going


through,
 and
 then
 you
 believe
 that
 any


level
 of
 additional
 spending
 from
 the


sovereigns,
 including
 China,
 will


increase
 the
 earnings
 estimates,


Nvidia's
 cheap,
 and
 I
 know
 the
 stock's


been
 stuck
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 weeks,


but
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 it
 will
 be


stuck
 going
 into
 2026
 if
 they
 put
 up


that
 earnings
 growth.
 Robin
 right
 there


hitting
 137.
 Oracle
 at
 221.
 We
 should


get
 Jolt
 data
 in
 about
 two
 minutes.


Adobe,
 that's
 at
 341.
 and
 Amazon
 going


green


at
 227
 as
 well.


Steve
 told
 Chris
 to
 buy
 Nvidia.
 Dude,


Steve's
 been
 telling
 Chris
 to
 buy
 Nvidia


since
 freaking


August
 of
 2024.
 We
 were
 on
 a
 three-way


phone
 call
 after
 Nvidia's
 Q3,
 no
 Q2
 2024


earnings.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 like
 at
 130


bucks
 or
 something.


And
 I
 I
 I
 hadn't
 initiated
 an
 Nvidia


position
 either,
 but
 Steve
 was
 telling


both
 of
 us
 that
 like
 it's
 hard
 to
 deny


the
 the
 earnings
 they're
 putting
 up.


Nvidia
 is
 the
 one
 company
 that's
 not


getting
 a
 massive
 premium
 in
 the
 market


for
 putting
 up
 massive
 earnings
 because


I
 mean,
 quite
 frankly,
 because
 of
 people


like
 Michael
 Bur
 spreading
 all
 this
 FUD


about
 Nvidia.
 I
 mean,
 when
 you've
 got


this
 much
 fear
 of
 an
 AI
 bubble
 and


Nvidia
 being
 the
 lynchpin
 of
 that


bubble,
 which
 is
 stupid
 because
 all


these
 other
 stocks
 are
 getting
 all
 this


momentum,
 but
 the
 reason
 they're
 getting


any
 excitement
 is
 because
 of
 AI.
 Nvidia


is
 at
 the
 center
 of
 AI,
 but
 Nvidia
 is


not
 getting
 the
 momentum.
 It's
 just
 it's


just
 becomes
 stupid.
 But
 it
 also
 is


healthy
 because
 I
 think
 it
 keeps
 us
 not


euphoric.
 Now,
 I
 think
 if
 we
 get
 to


$200,
 that's
 not
 euphoria.
 Probably,
 you


know,
 230,
 240
 is
 pushing
 it.
 But


getting
 anywhere
 near
 back
 to
 195,
 200


is
 not
 euphoria.


And
 I
 think
 we
 should
 be
 able
 to
 get


back
 there.
 Uh
 just
 based
 on
 that


earnings
 growth
 from
 from
 Nvidia.
 Okay,


Jolts.
 Don't
 have
 it
 yet.


Um
 we
 should
 be
 getting
 it
 soon.
 I'm


looking
 at
 it
 right
 now.


Street
 want
 7.2
 million.


S&P
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 red
 candle.
 What


did
 we
 get?
 Oh,
 we
 got
 October.
 Okay,
 we


got
 September
 and
 October.
 So,
 the


street
 wanted
 7.2
 million
 in
 September.


We
 came
 in
 way
 higher
 than
 expected
 by


about
 400,000.
 7.65
 million.
 Then
 Street


won
 at
 7.658


for
 October.
 Street
 came
 in
 at
 7.67.
 67


basically
 in
 line
 with
 expectations.


Job
 quits
 was
 2.9
 million
 in
 October,


3.28
 million
 in
 September.


So
 the
 way
 to
 interpret
 that
 is
 that
 if


you
 believe
 these
 are
 real
 jobs
 and
 not


fake
 jobs,
 we
 have
 essentially
 500,000


more
 jobs
 than
 expected
 since
 September.


October
 is
 basically
 in
 line.
 So,
 if
 you


ignore
 October
 expectations
 and
 look
 at


September,


I
 mean,
 I
 guess
 that's
 bullish


because
 there's
 more
 jobs
 than
 expected.


Now,
 are
 people
 getting
 hired
 just


because
 there's
 more
 jobs?
 Not


necessarily,
 given
 October
 was
 one
 of


the
 biggest
 months
 of
 layoffs
 that
 we've


seen
 in
 about
 10
 years.
 Um,


Fed
 rate
 cut
 probabilities
 are
 at
 89.2%.


So,
 not
 too
 affected.
 I
 don't
 think
 that


good
 news
 will
 turn
 into
 bad
 news
 for


the
 rate
 cut
 because
 I
 still
 think
 we're


going to
 get
 the
 rate
 cut
 even
 if
 it's
 a


hawkish
 cut.
 which
 could
 affect
 the


broader
 market.
 But
 that
 is
 the
 Joel


that
 we
 have.
 Let's
 get
 a
 little
 bit


more
 coverage
 on
 that


and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


670,000.


That's
 not
 a
 bad
 number.
 7670
 actually


would
 be
 the
 strongest
 number
 going
 back


to
 well
 going
 back
 to
 May
 when
 we
 were


77.7


million
 and
 change.
 So
 that's
 pretty


decent.
 And
 considering
 that
 the


expectation
 was
 for
 a
 number
 around
 7.1


million.
 So
 it's
 definitely
 better
 than


expected.
 We're
 also
 getting
 leading


economic
 indicators
 which
 have
 been


leading
 us
 in
 a
 negative
 bill
 lately.


This
 is
 September
 read
 coming
 in
 exactly


at
 his
 matching
 expectations
 at
 down


3/10en
 of
 a
 percent.
 Last
 month
 upgraded


from
 minus
 half
 a
 percent
 to
 minus
 310.


And
 believe
 it
 or
 not,


>> oh
 Parker
 likes
 it.
 Starting
 to
 go


green.
 Ethereum
 in
 particular,
 S&P
 as


well.


All right,
 let's
 see.
 Market
 seems
 to


like
 this
 data
 so
 far.


>> Minus
 310
 is
 actually
 the
 uh
 best
 number


going
 back
 to
 July
 when
 it
 was
 up
 110


because
 uh
 we
 really
 have
 been
 mostly


negative.
 We've
 had
 one
 non-
 negative


reading
 all
 year
 and
 that
 was
 the
 up


one10enth
 in
 July.
 We
 also
 had
 a
 zero


reading.
 So,
 this
 is
 the
 seventh


negative
 reading
 of
 2025.


>> Wow,
 dude.
 Ethan
 Bitcoin.
 All right.
 You


guys
 think
 it's
 fake
 or
 no?
 You
 guys


think
 it's
 fake
 or
 no?
 Is
 this
 a
 real


candle
 or
 this
 candle
 is
 going
 to
 be


crushed
 in
 the
 coming
 hours?
 3150.
 Look


at
 that.


That's
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 move
 right
 there.


Same
 thing
 with
 BTC.
 Just
 hit
 91.
 That's


a
 $1,000
 candle.


A
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 saying
 fake.
 You
 know,


I
 really
 want
 to
 believe
 it's
 real.
 Look


at
 Robin
 Hood
 trying
 to
 push
 138.
 I
 kind


of
 think
 it's
 fake
 as
 well,
 though.
 I


hope
 I'm
 I
 really
 hope
 I'm
 wrong,


but
 that
 big
 of
 a
 move
 on
 Jolt
 data
 to


me
 seems
 a
 bit
 irrational.
 Um,


it's
 good.
 It's
 not
 like
 phenomenal.
 And


there's
 nothing
 uniquely
 that's


affecting
 global
 liquidity
 based
 on
 that


jolt.
 It's
 not
 like
 we
 got
 a
 rate
 cut
 or


anything
 that
 justifies
 that
 massive
 of


a
 candle
 move.
 It's
 good
 data.
 I
 don't


know if
 it's
 enough
 to
 hold
 that
 type
 of


a
 move.
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 trying
 to
 go


green
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 candle


up.
 Even
 Hoodie,
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 if


we're
 really
 going
 to
 be
 pushing
 140


here,
 unless
 the
 market
 is
 thinking
 of


something
 else
 besides
 Jolts.
 They
 might


be
 interpreting
 it
 in
 a
 different
 way.


Even
 the
 S&P
 trying
 to
 push
 back
 to
 685.


the
 10-year


bonds
 are
 going
 up,
 which
 is
 not
 good,


or
 yields
 are
 going
 up,
 I
 should
 say.


It's
 really
 weird
 that
 yield
 I
 mean,


it's
 not
 weird.


I
 mean, if
 you
 think
 about
 it
 logically,


but
 conventionally,
 yield
 should
 be


going
 down
 on
 the
 idea
 of
 cuts
 coming


through.
 And
 unfortunately,


like,
 dude,
 this
 is
 the
 highest
 we've


had
 the
 tenure
 in
 a
 minute.


It's
 the
 highest
 it's
 been
 since
 August.


August
 was
 at
 4.3.
 So,
 it's
 it's
 it's


basically
 the
 highest
 in
 four
 months.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 because
 the
 market
 is


a
 little
 concerned
 that
 we're
 cutting


into
 a
 hot
 economy.
 This
 is
 where
 the


Fed's
 job
 gets
 hard
 because
 they
 have
 to


manage
 the
 labor
 market
 and
 the


inflation
 expectations,
 which
 is
 why


we're
 probably
 not
 getting
 50.
 But
 I


still
 think
 we'll
 get
 that
 25


tomorrow.


Okay.
 So,
 here's
 the
 question
 then
 for


tomorrow.
 Where's
 Tesla,
 by
 the
 way?


Tesla


443.
 Tesla's
 liking
 this.
 And
 then


Palunteer


Pounder
 182.
 By
 the
 way,
 I'm
 going
 to


have
 an
 interview
 coming
 out
 today
 with


uh
 the
 people
 that
 worked
 on
 the
 Pounder


and
 Nvidia
 partnership.
 I'm
 going
 to


have
 a
 bunch
 of
 interviews
 coming
 out.


It's
 going
 to
 be
 like
 one
 compilation


video
 today,
 but
 on
 X
 and
 the
 first


video
 in
 that
 compilation
 will
 be
 uh


interviewing
 the
 the
 people
 that
 set
 up


the
 Pounder
 Nvidia
 partnership.
 So,


that'll
 be
 out
 later
 today.
 And
 I
 think


there's
 some
 good
 takeaways
 from
 that.


But
 bounce
 right
 there
 at
 182,
 Tesla
 at


443.
 Uh
 here's
 the
 question
 for


tomorrow.
 Do
 we
 think
 the
 rate
 cut
 is


priced
 in?
 By
 the
 way,
 27%
 of
 you
 are


long
 Oracle,
 14%
 Adobe,
 13%
 both,
 46%


neither


going
 into
 Adobe
 and
 Oracle
 tomorrow.


Rate
 cut
 priced
 in.
 If
 you
 say
 yes,
 that


means
 we're
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 make
 a


massive
 move
 tomorrow.
 If
 you
 say
 no,


you're
 expecting
 some
 type
 of
 market


reaction
 that
 is
 positive.
 towards
 the


rate
 cut.
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 with
 no.
 I
 I
 I


like
 I
 understand
 why
 you
 would
 say
 it's


priced.
 It's
 the
 most
 anticipated
 rate


cut
 of
 all
 time.
 So,
 yes,
 it's
 priced


in,
 but
 I
 also
 think
 the
 market
 really


wants
 this
 cut.
 And
 it's
 not
 a
 August


pivot
 type
 of
 uh
 JPO
 FOMC
 where
 you
 know


in
 August
 when
 he
 said
 we're
 more
 likely


to
 cut
 than
 not
 that
 that
 just


completely
 made
 everything
 green.
 But
 I


do
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 bullish.
 Now,


could
 it
 be
 a
 hawkish
 cut?
 Yes.
 And
 I


know
 conventional
 wisdom
 says
 JPAL
 is


going
 to
 be
 more
 conservative
 tomorrow.


But
 I
 also
 think
 there's
 a
 world
 where


they're
 going
 to
 say
 the
 labor
 market
 is


not
 in
 a
 good
 spot.
 And
 that's
 enough
 to


create
 uh
 excitement
 in
 the
 credit


market
 to
 or
 at least
 in
 the
 stock


market,
 maybe
 not
 the
 credit
 market,
 to


think
 that
 the
 cutting
 is
 going
 to


continue
 into
 early
 2026.


Maybe
 I'm
 dead
 wrong
 on
 that.
 And
 and
 I


I
 think
 it
 is
 a
 bit
 contrarian
 to
 say


that
 it's
 not
 priced
 in
 given,
 you
 know,


basically
 we're
 at
 alltime
 highs
 on
 the


S&P.
 It's
 hard
 to
 say
 that
 it's
 not


priced
 in,
 but
 I
 still
 think
 we
 get
 a


move
 tomorrow.
 I
 think
 we
 get
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 move
 tomorrow,
 even
 if
 it's
 not


1%,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 half
 a
 percent
 on


the
 S&P,
 which
 gets
 us
 closer
 to
 that


alltime
 high
 at
 689.
 We're
 at
 684
 right


here


on
 the
 S&P
 500.


Hawkish
 dot
 plot
 and
 speech
 will
 take


any
 pump.
 Do
 we
 get
 the
 the
 SCP


tomorrow?
 Do
 we
 get
 summary
 of
 economic


projections?


I
 think
 we
 do.
 Oh,
 that's
 that's


actually
 another
 thing
 to
 consider


because
 if
 we
 get
 the
 SCP
 that
 that
 that


creates
 even
 more
 data


that
 the
 market's
 going
 to
 be
 uh
 going


to
 be
 navigating.
 We
 do.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 So


that
 so
 then
 then
 we
 have
 to
 look
 at


what
 their
 trajectory
 of
 rate
 cuts
 look


like,
 not
 only
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 a


rate
 cut
 or
 not.


Uh
 Bitcoin
 trying
 to
 hold
 that
 $1,000


candle.
 Same
 with
 ETH,


but
 they're
 not
 really
 building
 on
 that.


BMR
 right
 there
 just
 went
 green
 at
 3590.


Tom
 Lee
 did
 buy
 another
 415
 million
 of


Ethereum
 last
 week.
 That
 was
 disclosed


yesterday.


So
 he
 continues
 to
 add
 more.
 Chat
 GBT


nearly
 900
 million
 weekly
 active
 users.


I
 think
 this
 was
 reported
 by
 multiple


sources
 yesterday
 as
 well,
 especially
 by


the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal.
 So
 that
 makes


sense.
 They
 will
 probably
 get
 to
 that


billion
 user
 mark
 soon.


Now
 the
 question
 is,
 is
 a
 billion
 weekly


users
 enough
 to
 fend
 off
 all
 the


competition?


Especially
 because
 they're
 weekly,


they're
 not
 monthly.


Like
 the
 fact
 that
 900
 million
 people


come
 back
 every
 single
 week


is
 pretty
 crazy.


We'll
 admit
 make
 enough
 in
 2026
 to
 buy
 a


box
 of
 tissues.


Hopefully.


Hopefully
 we're
 not
 needing
 that
 many


tissues
 next
 year.
 Yes,
 I
 will
 be


streaming
 the
 Fed
 decision
 and
 talk


tomorrow.
 I'll
 be
 live
 at
 around
 2:20.


So,
 10
 minutes
 before
 the
 Fed
 goes
 live,


they
 go
 live
 at
 2:30
 p.m.
 Eastern.
 I'll


be
 live
 at
 2:20
 p.m.
 Eastern


and
 uh
 we
 will
 get
 some
 reaction
 to
 to


these
 rate
 cuts.
 All right,
 let's
 get
 a


little
 bit
 more
 analysis
 on
 this
 Jolts


data
 and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from


there
 and
 see
 what
 other
 headlines
 we


have
 coming
 in


>> from
 stores,
 from
 restaurants,
 all
 of


that.
 So
 they
 have
 pre-th
 Thanksgiving


holiday
 shopping
 in
 yellow
 and
 Black


Friday
 through
 Cyber
 Monday
 in
 blue
 and


they
 look
 at
 it
 by
 income
 group
 and
 if


you
 know
 we've
 heard
 a
 lot
 about
 the


K-shaped
 economy
 from
 companies
 and
 from


executives
 but
 here
 it
 is
 in
 the
 data


that
 they
 are
 seeing
 in
 the
 actual


spending.
 So
 if
 you
 look


pre-Thanksgiving
 clearly
 that
 trend
 was


very
 much
 in
 place
 where
 we
 saw
 you
 know


the
 dip
 in
 spending
 from
 the
 uh
 the


lower
 income
 cohort.
 It's
 continued


throughout
 this
 holiday
 shopping
 season


where
 pre-Thanksgiving
 shopping
 and
 also


Black
 Friday
 to
 Cyber
 Monday
 spending
 at


the
 lower
 income
 has
 been
 soft
 or


actually
 declining.
 Very
 different
 story


if
 you
 make
 you
 know
 for
 family


household
 of
 more
 than
 $100,000
 as
 you


can
 see
 strong
 growth
 there
 and
 just


some
 interesting
 tidbits
 from
 the
 data


of
 where
 the
 growth
 is
 and
 where
 the


spending
 is
 happening.
 off-pric


department
 stores.
 TJ
 Maxx
 was
 cited
 as


one.
 TJX
 discount
 in
 dollar
 stores.
 All


three
 dollar
 stores
 were
 were
 cited
 in


that
 data
 saw
 growth.
 Footwear
 up
 4%.


Active
 and
 athleisure
 was
 very
 strong.


Some
 of
 the
 places
 that
 weren't
 seeing


as
 much
 growth
 during
 this
 holiday


spending
 were
 the
 uh
 luxury
 department


stores.
 Think
 Neiman
 Marcus,
 Saks
 Fifth


Avenue,
 the
 plus-size
 stores
 like
 Elaine


Bryant,
 which
 might
 speak
 to,
 you
 know,


the
 GLP1
 impact
 that's
 been
 in
 longtime


decline
 over
 the
 last
 few
 months.
 So,


the
 spending
 is
 happening
 in,


interestingly,
 cosmetics,
 footwear,


athleisure,
 and
 again,
 at
 the
 high


income,
 it
 really
 jives
 with
 what
 we


heard
 from
 Walmart
 CEO
 earlier
 on


Squawkbox
 today,
 Doug
 McMillan,
 joining,


and
 he
 reemphasized
 what
 they
 said
 on


earnings,
 which
 is
 people
 with
 higher


income
 levels
 are
 shopping
 with
 us
 more


often
 and
 have
 been
 for
 a
 while.
 But


there's
 pressure
 for
 those
 at
 the
 lower


income
 levels.
 That's
 the
 story
 of
 the


consumer
 right
 now.


>> It's
 been
 the
 ongoing
 story
 for
 a
 long


time,
 hasn't
 it,
 Sarah?
 I
 mean,


nothing's
 really
 changed.


>> It
 it
 appears
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 worse,


you
 know,
 and
 especially
 during
 holiday


spending
 where
 where
 everyone
 sort
 of


pulls
 out
 all
 the
 stops
 for
 spending.
 To


see
 that
 gap
 is
 the
 first
 time
 I've
 I've


really
 seen
 that.
 But
 look,
 cumulative


impact
 of
 inflation.
 That's
 why
 the


administration's
 talking
 about


affordability
 right
 now,
 you
 know,
 and


the
 fact
 that


jobs
 aren't
 as
 plentiful.
 Ultimately,


that
 that's
 weighing
 on
 the
 down
 part
 of


the
 market.
 Not
 Toll
 Brothers.
 Toll


Brothers,
 I
 don't
 know if
 you
 saw
 in


their
 results,
 but
 they
 were
 saying
 it's


a
 plus
 because
 our
 fourth
 quarter


results
 demonstrate
 that
 our
 luxury


business
 is
 differentiated.
 We
 serve
 a


more
 affluent
 customer
 who
 is
 less


impacted
 by
 these
 affordability


pressures.


>> But
 even
 they
 guided
 lower
 than
 the


street
 was
 expecting
 on
 deliveries
 and


stocks
 down
 3%
 today.
 not
 not
 off
 off


the
 opening
 lows
 actually,
 but
 it's


going
 to
 take
 you
 back
 about
 a
 month
 or


so.


>> Right.
 But
 I
 just


>> So
 September
 spending
 or
 not
 September


spending,
 Black
 Friday
 spending
 as


they're
 talking
 about
 in
 November


continues
 to
 be
 pretty
 strong.
 The


problem
 is
 it
 continues
 to
 be
 strong


potentially
 by
 one
 uh
 demographic
 in


this
 country,
 which
 are
 upper
 and
 middle


class
 consumers
 who
 are
 once
 again


subsidizing
 all
 the
 consumer
 spend.
 So,


this
 whole
 K-shaped
 economy
 thing
 that


we've
 been
 talking
 about
 for
 a
 long


time,
 I
 mean,
 a
 2026
 trend
 looks
 like


that's
 going
 to
 continue.
 I
 don't
 see


how
 that
 doesn't
 continue.
 I
 mean,
 the


way
 it
 doesn't
 continue
 is
 if
 the
 upper


end
 consumer
 stops
 spending.
 But
 I
 I


don't
 see
 the
 lower-end
 consumer


starting
 to
 pick
 up
 their
 spend
 because


obviously
 that's
 not
 easy
 to
 happen
 if


you're
 not
 seeing
 massive
 wage
 growth,


if
 you're
 not
 seeing
 massive
 job
 growth,


and
 the
 labor
 market's
 not
 being
 that


productive
 right
 now.
 So,
 I
 I
 I
 think


that
 K-shaped
 economy,
 if
 you're
 long


the
 stock
 market,
 you've
 kind
 of
 got
 to


believe
 that
 that
 thesis
 will
 continue


to
 play
 out
 because
 if
 it
 doesn't,
 then,


you
 know,
 some
 of
 these
 equity
 prices


are
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 be


supported.
 But
 the
 retailer
 earnings


that
 we
 saw
 last
 week
 and
 over
 the
 past


couple
 weeks
 going
 into
 Black
 Friday


have
 been
 pretty
 strong
 regardless
 of


who
 is
 doing
 the
 spending.
 Google
 right


there
 at
 312,
 that's
 down
 about.36%.
 and


Meta


657


still
 down


1.3%
 on
 the
 day.
 What's
 your
 opinion
 on


Netflix?
 I'm
 staying
 out
 of
 this
 one.
 I


mean,
 I
 thought
 there
 was
 something


interesting
 to
 this
 story.
 If
 you
 know,


I
 was
 interested
 when
 I
 thought
 they


could
 legitimately
 buy


Warner
 Brothers.
 Now,
 I
 think
 it's
 just


going to
 be
 a
 regulatory
 mess.
 And
 even


if
 they
 do
 get
 it,
 I
 don't
 think
 there's


any
 rush
 to
 buy
 Netflix.
 Like,
 first
 of


all,
 it
 trades
 at
 a
 45
 times
 P.
 It's
 not


like
 you're
 necessarily
 getting
 a
 a


cheap
 stock,
 per
 se.
 Um,
 then
 number


two,
 you
 have
 to
 ask
 yourself,
 is
 the


quality
 of
 the
 business
 you're
 getting


so
 phenomenal
 that
 you're
 willing
 to
 pay


40
 times
 earnings
 even
 if
 the


acquisition
 takes
 a
 couple
 years
 to


settle
 down?
 And
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 the


answer
 to
 that
 question
 is
 yes.


Primarily
 because,
 you
 know,
 the
 reason


Netflix
 got
 a
 premium
 early
 this
 year
 is


because
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 thought
 we
 were


going to
 go
 into
 a
 recession,
 especially


during
 the
 tariff.
 You
 know,
 Netflix


actually
 was
 thriving
 during
 the


Liberation
 Day
 stuff.
 It
 still
 took
 a


hit,
 but
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 it
 was
 up
 a


lot
 is
 because
 soon
 after
 uh
 is
 because


it
 was
 viewed
 as
 a
 consumer
 defensive


and
 I
 think
 that
 narrative
 is
 starting


to
 fade
 out
 like
 people
 don't
 really


care
 that
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 cancel


your
 Netflix
 account
 like
 that's
 not
 a


premium
 that's
 added
 to
 the
 stock.
 So


when
 it
 was
 at
 120
 you
 know
 is
 really


richly
 valued
 with
 that
 premium
 I
 don't


know
 if
 it
 gets
 that
 easily
 anymore.


So


yeah
 and
 and
 again
 even
 if
 they
 get


Warner
 Brothers
 then
 the
 question
 is


like
 when
 like
 how
 and
 when
 do
 they


resolve
 all
 of
 this?
 I
 was
 reading
 some


reports
 that
 says
 Netflix
 is
 just
 going


to
 let
 HBO
 Max
 function
 independently.


So,
 it's
 not
 even
 going
 to
 bring
 the


content
 onto
 Netflix's
 platform,
 which
 I


think
 would
 be
 a
 disaster
 because
 like


it
 would
 be
 annoying
 to
 have
 to
 switch


back
 and
 forth
 even
 though
 they're
 both


owned
 by
 Netflix.
 So,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


questions
 than
 answers,
 not
 to
 mention


all
 the
 regulatory
 hurdles.


So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think
 maybe
 we
 had


to
 do
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 deep
 diving
 to


see
 if
 this
 is
 really
 along
 going
 into


2026.


Yeah,
 even
 Netflix
 is
 not
 in
 a
 hurry.


Well,
 we
 got
 to
 see
 if
 Netflix


counteracts.
 I
 mean,
 imagine
 uh


Paramount
 says,
 "Hey,
 we'll
 do
 $31
 a


share."
 Now,
 we're
 definitively
 bigger


than
 Netflix,


even
 if
 you
 exclude
 the
 the the
 cable


service.
 I
 mean,
 does
 Netflix
 come
 back


and
 say,
 "We'll
 do
 $32
 a
 share."
 I
 mean,


like,
 does
 it
 really
 just
 become
 a


bidding
 war
 at
 that
 point?
 And
 I
 don't


know
 if
 Netflix
 shareholders
 are
 going


to


going
 to
 love
 if
 that
 happens
 either.


Um,
 why
 is
 Uber
 falling?
 Uber
 at
 90.


That's
 down
 about
 2%.
 Uber
 still
 had
 a


good
 year.
 It
 was
 at
 50
 in
 the
 beginning


of
 the
 year.
 Uh,
 it
 was
 at
 80
 a
 couple


months
 ago,
 so
 or
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago.


So,
 this
 one
 is
 still
 having
 a
 decent


recovery.
 $9.59.
 Dra
 was
 tweeting.
 He's


in
 Japan.
 Uber's
 signing
 a
 bunch
 of


partnerships
 in
 Japan
 this
 morning


as
 they
 continue
 to
 grow
 their
 presence


in
 the
 region.
 uh
 in
 the
 region
 app


loven
 amazing
 amazing
 recovery
 right


here.
 Look
 at
 that
 from
 520
 to
 711
 in


two
 weeks.


Uh
 the
 SEC
 probe
 is
 still
 there.
 I
 don't


know if
 the
 market
 cares
 that
 much
 about


it,
 but
 one
 of
 the
 better
 growth
 names


that's,
 you
 know,
 AppLoving,
 I
 think,


really
 shows
 you
 how
 much
 investors
 care


about
 growth
 because
 this
 is
 one
 of the


best
 growth
 names
 in
 the
 entire
 market


in
 the
 adtech
 space.
 And
 even
 with
 an


SEC
 probe
 and
 just
 getting
 their
 stock


hammered
 down,


the
 market
 wants
 growth
 and
 they're


willing
 to
 pay
 a
 multiple
 for
 growth.


And
 so,
 you
 know,
 trading
 at
 45
 times


sales,
 it's
 aggressive
 on
 Apploven,
 but


they're
 also
 growing
 at
 77%.


It's
 not
 many
 companies
 that
 are
 putting


up
 that
 revenue
 growth.
 So,
 makes
 sense


that
 that
 one's
 recovering.
 Tesla
 right


there
 at
 445.
 And
 then
 pounder


at


182.


Amcor,
 we
 are
 still
 holding
 on
 to
 43.


That's
 down
 about
 3%


on
 the
 day
 as
 that
 one's
 had
 a
 pretty


big
 run.
 Wolfpack
 Research
 just
 said
 we


are
 short
 CES.


SEES
 is
 a
 $731
 million
 company
 down
 5%.


Uh
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 this
 company
 is,


but
 Wolfpack
 Research
 just
 came
 out
 and


said
 they're
 short.


They
 said
 they
 have
 a
 series
 of
 phantom


deals
 to
 distract
 from
 their
 two
 largest


customers,
 which
 make
 up
 74%
 of
 sales.


This
 is
 not
 a
 massive
 short
 most
 likely,


but


it
 is
 one
 of the
 ones
 that
 was
 announced


today.
 Uh,
 Google
 Cloud
 was
 selected
 for


Gemini
 in
 the
 government
 to
 serve
 as
 the


first
 enterprise
 AI
 deployed
 on
 the
 US


Department
 of
 War's
 Generative
 AI


initiative
 from
 the
 CDAO.


Okay,
 more
 bullish
 Google


Cloud
 getting
 put
 into


getting
 put
 into
 the
 Department
 of
 War.


The
 other
 uh
 thing
 that
 Trump
 announced


yesterday
 was
 this
 like
 one
 AI
 executive


order
 to
 kind
 of
 uh
 basically
 unify
 all


of
 the
 AI
 initiatives
 that
 the
 country


is
 trying
 to
 navigate,
 which
 I
 think
 is


bullish
 because
 essentially
 you're


trying
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 the


bureaucracy
 that
 comes
 with
 models
 and


innovating.
 I
 mean,
 right
 now
 you
 have


California
 that
 has
 certain
 laws
 around


AI,
 Texas
 that
 has
 certain
 laws
 around


AI,
 and
 they
 can
 have
 those
 laws,
 but


having
 a
 federal
 standard,
 I
 don't


think,
 is
 a
 bad
 thing
 so
 that
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 can
 start
 fasttracking
 their


progress
 in
 AI.
 And
 so,
 you've
 got
 that


from
 the
 the
 Trump
 administration
 as


well.


Uh,
 do
 you
 like
 Zeta?
 Yes,
 I
 like
 Zeta.


I
 think
 it's
 cheap.
 It's
 undervalued,


but
 again,
 Zeta
 is
 still
 a
 growth
 stock


that
 like
 the
 pressure
 is
 on
 them
 to


keep
 growing.
 Now,
 they've
 executed
 very


well
 back
 above
 19,
 but
 they
 have
 any


hiccups
 in
 2026.
 You
 know,
 the
 stock


probably
 is
 going
 to
 take
 a
 hit.
 So,
 $4


billion
 market
 cap.
 The
 biggest
 red
 flag


you
 can
 point
 to
 is
 their
 stockbased


comp,
 which
 is
 not
 that
 big
 a
 red
 flag.


So,
 I
 do
 like
 this
 one
 going
 into


going
 into
 next
 year.


Yes,
 we
 will
 be
 doing
 technical
 Tuesday


with
 Jason
 later
 today.
 Nvidia
 still


flat
 on
 the
 day
 18421.
 Yeah,
 let's
 pull


up
 the
 heat
 map
 and
 see
 what
 we're


looking
 at.


It's
 kind
 of
 flat.
 I
 mean,
 I
 know
 things


feel
 red,
 but
 it's
 not
 that
 red.


I
 mean,
 you've
 got
 Google
 and
 Meta
 that


are
 red.
 Broadcom's
 red.
 Broadcom
 is


earnings
 on
 Thursday
 as
 well.
 That'll
 be


a
 big
 one.
 Financials
 are
 up.
 Healthcare


is
 up.
 That's
 what
 Ed
 Yardani
 said
 to
 go


long
 on
 as
 well.
 Financials
 and


healthcare
 again.
 Like
 I
 really
 respect


him,
 but
 I
 I
 I
 I
 really
 could
 not


believe
 he
 says
 go
 underweight
 the
 max
 7


next
 year.
 Go
 long
 healthcare
 and


financials.


Like
 do
 we
 really
 think
 that's
 going
 to


be
 the
 trade?
 Do
 we
 really
 think
 Bank
 of


America
 is
 going
 to
 outperform
 Amazon


next
 year?
 I
 know
 it
 outperformed
 it


this
 year.
 Does
 it
 outperform
 it
 two


years
 in
 a
 row


in
 the
 in
 the
 age
 of
 robotics
 and
 margin


efficiencies
 and
 everything
 where
 like
 I


don't
 know
 dude
 that's
 hard
 to
 imagine


like
 Bank
 of
 America's
 had
 a
 great
 year.


Are
 we
 expecting
 two
 years
 in
 a
 row
 of


outperformance


on
 financials
 and
 healthcare
 against


tech?


Again,
 some
 of
 these
 tech
 names
 didn't


even
 have
 a
 good
 year.
 They've
 had
 a


good
 decade,
 but
 they've
 not
 had
 a
 good


year.
 Meta's
 up
 9%
 year
 to
 date.
 Okay.


underperforming
 the
 S&P.


Amazon
 freaking
 up
 3%
 year
 to
 date.


Google's
 been
 the
 best
 one
 obviously,


but
 it's
 really
 an
 anomaly
 because


nothing
 else
 has
 lived
 up
 to
 Google.


Tesla
 even
 year
 to
 date,
 if
 you
 bought


at
 the
 lows
 on
 Tesla,
 you've
 doubled,


but
 it's
 up
 17%.
 Okay,
 basically


matching
 the
 S&P.


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 was
 very
 shocked
 to
 hear


that
 from
 him.
 I
 really
 didn't
 expect


that,
 especially
 because
 he's
 been
 so


bullish
 on
 tech.
 So,
 it's
 not
 like
 he's


not
 been
 bullish
 on.
 I
 don't know
 if


next
 year
 is
 the
 year
 you
 get
 not


bearish,
 but
 underweight


given
 all
 the
 growth
 from
 the
 S&P
 is


coming
 from
 tech.
 Speaking
 of
 tech,


Europe
 is
 uh
 not
 really
 the
 happiest


with
 some
 of
 our
 tech
 companies.
 So,


people
 probably
 have
 seen
 this
 chart.
 By


the
 way,
 PayPal
 got
 downgraded
 again


today
 from
 74
 to
 67
 by
 Wells
 Fargo.
 So,


PayPal
 continuously
 getting
 hit.
 Uh
 take


a
 look
 at
 this
 chart
 that's
 been
 going


pretty
 viral.
 The
 EU
 makes
 more
 from


fines
 on
 US
 tech
 companies
 than
 from
 the


tax
 of
 all
 public
 European
 companies.
 In


2024,
 the
 EU
 fined
 US
 tech
 companies
 3.8


billion
 euros.
 Meanwhile,
 the
 public


internet
 tech
 companies
 inside
 of


Europe,
 which
 includes
 Spotify,
 SAP,


etc.
 paid
 only
 3.2
 billion
 in
 income


tax.
 This
 comes
 after
 uh
 finding
 X
 like


$400
 million
 or
 something
 because


they're
 upset
 at
 the
 blue
 check


verification
 system.


And
 Trump
 has
 been
 like
 saying
 that
 the


EU
 is
 being
 ridiculous
 about
 this.
 And


this
 was
 Trump
 yesterday
 when
 he
 was


asked
 about
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 the
 EU.


>> Out
 by
 uh
 what
 uh
 your
 posture
 is
 and


your


>> No,
 they
 should
 be
 freaked
 out
 by
 what


they're
 doing
 to
 their
 countries.


They're
 destroying
 their
 countries.


>> Well,
 European
 Council
 President
 people


I
 like.
 Look,
 there
 are
 people
 I
 like.
 I


get
 along
 with
 them.
 You
 you
 know
 that.


But
 they
 can't
 let
 this
 happen.
 And
 it


gets
 to
 a
 point
 where
 you
 can't
 really


correct
 it.
 There'll
 be
 a
 point
 and
 it's


very
 close
 to
 that
 point.


>> And
 what
 will
 that
 mean?


>> It
 will
 mean
 that
 they're
 no
 longer


going
 to
 be
 strong
 nations.


>> Does
 that
 mean
 they
 won't
 be
 allies


>> or
 they'll
 be
 Well,
 it
 depends.
 You


know,
 it
 depends.
 They'll
 change
 their


ideology
 obviously
 because
 the
 people


coming
 in
 have
 a
 totally
 different


ideology.
 But
 uh
 it's
 uh
 it's
 going
 to


make
 them
 much
 weaker.
 They'll
 be
 a
 much


they'll
 be
 much
 weaker
 and
 they'll
 be


much
 different.


>> And
 what
 will
 that
 mean
 for
 our


relation?


>> Look
 at
 your
 mayor
 of
 London.
 He's
 a


disaster.
 He's
 a
 disaster.
 He's
 got
 a


totally
 different
 ideology
 of
 what
 he's


supposed
 to
 have.
 And
 he
 gets
 elected


because
 so
 many
 people
 have
 come
 in,


they
 vote
 for
 him
 now
 because,
 you
 know,


it's
 like
 it's
 uh
 one
 of
 those
 things.


But
 I
 hate
 what's
 happened
 to
 London
 and


I
 hate
 what's
 happened
 to
 Paris.
 I
 hate


when
 I
 see
 it.


The
 weird
 thing
 about
 the
 uh
 Elon
 Musk
 X


lawsuit
 from
 the
 EU
 is
 that
 one
 of
 the


guys
 who's
 leading
 it
 has
 the
 blue
 check


verification.
 And
 so
 he
 started
 tweeting


at
 Elon
 about
 how
 the
 blue
 check


verification.
 I'll
 see
 if
 I
 can
 find
 the


tweet,
 but
 it
 was
 so
 weird.
 He
 was
 just


like,
 "This
 makes
 it
 hard
 to
 understand


what's
 actually
 true
 or
 not
 on
 the


platform."


Mind
 you,
 he
 has
 the
 verification
 mark.


So
 obviously
 he
 was
 a
 fan
 to
 to
 pay
 for


the
 verification.
 But
 they're
 suing


Tesla
 or
 not
 Tesla
 at
 X
 for
 for


initiating
 an
 ability
 to
 pay
 to
 be


verified,
 which
 if
 anything
 democratizes


more
 than
 it
 isolates
 because
 before
 it


was
 this
 arbitrary
 group
 of
 people
 that


worked
 at
 Twitter
 who
 decided
 who
 gets


to
 be
 verified
 or
 not.
 Now
 you
 can
 pay


for
 it
 and
 you
 can
 verify
 like
 you're
 a


real
 person
 because
 you
 have
 to


literally
 submit
 a
 piece
 of
 ID


to
 to
 even
 even
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 to


be
 verified.


So
 I
 don't
 know
 it's
 very
 weird
 but


you're
 getting
 more
 and
 more
 of
 these


fines
 which
 are
 not
 friendly
 to
 uh
 to


United
 States
 tech
 companies.
 And
 so


this
 is
 where
 the
 tariff
 things
 become


so
 important
 because
 if
 if
 if
 the


Supreme
 Court
 comes
 out
 and
 says,
 "Hey,


uh
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 reverse
 the


tariffs."
 You
 know,
 part
 of
 the
 reason


Trump
 has
 been
 able
 to
 negotiate
 with


the
 EU
 is
 by
 saying,
 "Hey,
 you
 know,
 if


you
 don't
 treat
 our
 tech
 companies


correctly,
 then
 we're
 just
 going
 to


increase
 the
 tariffs."
 If
 he
 loses
 that


form
 of
 leverage,


it
 could
 be
 an
 easier
 way
 for
 the
 EU
 to


enforce
 some
 of
 these
 lawsuits
 on
 Meta


and
 Google.
 Even
 Meta
 came
 out
 two
 days


ago
 and
 said
 they're
 likely
 going
 to
 be


using
 less
 user
 data
 for
 advertising


inside
 of
 certain
 countries
 in
 the
 EU


because
 of
 some
 of
 the
 fines
 that


they've
 been
 getting,
 which
 potentially


just
 means
 worse
 targeting
 for


advertisers
 in
 the
 region,
 which


potentially
 is
 bearish
 for
 Meta's


revenue,
 but
 also
 it
 means
 a
 worse
 user


experience
 theoretically
 for
 people
 that


are
 using
 Facebook
 and
 Instagram
 in
 the


region.


So,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 see,
 you


know,
 long
 term
 how
 that
 how
 that
 also


ends
 up
 playing
 out
 for
 a
 lot
 of these


tech
 companies.
 Uh,
 Nvidia
 right
 there


at
 184
 AppLoving
 715.
 The
 reason


Apploven
 is
 up,
 I'm
 seeing
 the
 headline


right
 now
 is
 a
 Gentic
 commerce.


Uh,
 their
 new
 ecom
 ad
 product
 was


universally
 phenomenal
 with
 some
 clients


shifting
 from
 40%
 to
 80%
 on
 retargeting.


They
 said
 this
 at
 a
 conference
 this


morning.


So
 Apploven
 showing
 off
 that
 their


actual
 AI
 initiatives
 inside
 of


retargeting


continues
 to
 work
 very
 well.
 7:15
 that's


up
 4%


on
 the
 day.


Um


silver
 still
 above
 60
 or
 breaking
 60.


Let's
 see.


No,
 hasn't
 broke
 60
 yet.
 5962
 for


silver.
 up
 3%
 on
 the
 day.
 Very
 close


to
 breaking
 that
 $60
 level,


which
 would
 be
 pretty
 massive


psychologically


for
 them
 as
 well.
 Let's
 get
 an
 update
 on


Nvidia


and
 what
 we've
 got
 going
 on
 with
 this


H200


export
 control
 now
 being
 lifted
 for


China.


>> Let's
 get
 right
 to
 Christina
 Partzos


who's
 been
 covering
 this
 all
 morning.


Hey
 KP.


>> Hi
 Carl.
 So,
 like
 you
 said,
 President


Trump
 approved
 specifically
 Nvidia's


H200
 chip
 sales
 to
 China
 with
 the
 US


government
 taking
 roughly
 a
 25%
 uh
 stake


of
 that
 revenue.
 But
 the
 upside
 may
 be


limited.
 Why
 is
 that?
 There
 are
 three


major
 challenges.
 First,
 margins
 could


take
 a
 hit
 because
 US
 government
 20
 25%


fee
 actually
 reduces
 what
 Nvidia
 would


make
 from
 each
 China
 sale.
 Second,


packaging
 capacity
 at
 Taiwan
 semi
 TSMC


is
 already
 tight.
 So,
 it
 may
 be
 very


difficult
 to
 increase
 that
 inventory
 for


China.
 And
 then
 most
 critically
 third,


China
 could
 still
 block
 these
 imports
 as


domestic
 alternatives
 really
 lag
 H200


performance
 by
 just
 a
 12
 to
 18
 months.


But
 we
 know
 that
 Beijing
 wants
 China
 to


focus
 on
 domestic
 alternatives.
 And
 then


there's
 another
 little
 wrinkle
 too.
 The


H200
 uses
 HBM
 3
 AI
 memory
 chips.
 So
 just


think
 of
 it
 as
 just
 really
 advanced


memory
 which
 are
 currently
 restricted
 by


the
 US
 government
 for
 sale
 to
 China.
 So,


it's
 still
 unclear
 if
 President
 Trump's


approval
 also
 lifts
 restrictions
 on


those
 particular
 memory
 chips
 or
 if
 that


requires
 separate
 regulatory
 changes.


Once
 all
 of
 those
 hurdles
 are
 overcome,


Wells
 Fargo
 sees
 an
 incremental
 about
 25


to30
 billion
 though
 in
 annual
 China


revenue.
 But
 there's
 still
 just
 a
 lot
 of


uncertainty
 why
 you're
 not
 seeing
 a


reaction
 in
 the
 stock.
 Many
 analysts,


including
 Wed
 Bush's
 Matt
 Bryson,
 say


quote,
 "They're
 reluctant
 to
 really


shift
 their
 models
 right
 now,
 which


currently
 assume
 no
 revenue
 contribution


from
 China."
 Even
 with
 President
 Trump's


approval
 and
 maybe
 existing
 Nvidia


Nvidia
 inventory
 for
 these
 H200s,
 the


path
 to
 meaningful
 China
 revenue
 faces


major
 roadblocks
 on
 margins,
 capacity,


memory,
 chip
 access,
 and
 most


importantly,
 Beijing's
 acceptance.
 And


Beijing
 may
 already
 be
 pushing
 back.
 The


Financial
 Times
 is
 reporting
 Chinese


regulators
 are
 considering
 restricting


these
 H200
 chips.
 Security
 concerns
 with


Nvidia's
 other
 H20
 chips
 that
 are


already
 geared
 towards
 China
 would
 still


apply
 to
 these
 H200
 since
 there's
 still


the
 the
 same
 family,
 the
 Hopper
 family.


Beijing
 has
 also
 poured
 billions
 of


dollars
 into
 domestic
 alternatives
 from


Huawei
 to
 Capricon.
 Bernstein
 expects


China's
 local
 AI
 chip
 supply
 to
 grow


five
 times
 larger
 by
 2028.
 So
 Washington


may
 have
 said
 yes,
 but
 China
 could
 still


say
 no,
 guys.


Uh
 Christina,
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 H200,


just
 in
 terms
 of
 comparing
 it
 to
 the


H20,
 how
 much
 more
 powerful
 is
 it?
 How


does
 it
 compete?
 If
 there's
 a
 way
 to


even
 judge
 with
 what
 is
 exist,
 you
 know,


what's
 available
 already
 from
 the
 likes


of
 Huawei
 in
 China?


>> It
 depends
 on
 which
 research
 pack
 you'll


use,
 but
 it's
 anywhere
 between
 five
 and


eight
 times
 more
 powerful
 than
 the
 H20.


So
 the
 H200
 is
 anywhere
 between
 five
 to


eight
 times
 more
 powerful
 than
 the
 H200,


primarily
 because
 of
 uh
 the
 memory


capacity
 on
 said
 chips.
 The
 H200
 is
 the


first
 chip
 to
 have
 high
 bandwidth
 memory


3e
 uh
 available
 in
 the
 Nvidia
 family.


Obviously,
 the
 Blackwell
 has
 that
 as


well,
 but
 um
 it's
 definitely
 a
 step
 up.


It's
 definitely
 a
 step
 up
 and
 we
 know


Chinese
 companies
 would
 want
 access
 to


it.
 We
 know
 that
 the
 Justice
 Department


just
 blocked
 uh
 millions
 of
 dollars
 of


chips
 that
 were
 illegally
 chi
 being


exported
 to
 China.
 They
 removed
 the


labels
 and
 put
 a
 a
 fake
 label
 on
 there.


So,
 we
 know
 that
 there's
 still
 a
 lot
 of


interest.
 Uh
 but
 of
 course
 China
 and


every
 country
 and
 company
 around
 the


world
 would
 rather
 get
 their
 hands
 on


the
 most
 advanced
 version
 which
 is


Blackwell.


>> So
 again,
 China
 is
 trying
 to
 put
 up
 a


image
 of
 hey
 we
 don't
 need
 your
 H200s


because
 we'll
 do
 it
 with
 our
 own


internal
 Huawei
 chips.
 That's
 just
 not


reality.
 Like
 they
 would
 love
 to
 have


the
 H200s
 and
 they
 probably
 will
 buy


some
 of
 them.
 I
 just
 don't
 think
 they


want
 to
 buy
 billions
 and
 billions
 of


dollars
 worth
 of
 it
 even
 if
 it
 would
 be


effective
 for
 their
 researchers
 u


because
 the
 perception
 is
 they
 don't


want
 to
 be
 getting
 the
 worst
 type
 of


chip
 in
 comparison
 to
 the
 US
 that
 gets


to
 have
 the
 best
 chip
 which
 is
 Nvidia's


black
 belt.
 So
 like
 net
 net
 the
 impact


on
 Nvidia
 should
 still
 be
 positive


because
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 selling


some
 chips
 even
 if
 you're
 not
 selling


$30
 billion
 worth
 of
 chips
 next
 year
 to


China,
 you
 know,
 even
 if
 you're
 selling


five
 or
 four
 billion,
 like
 that's
 still


bullish.


But
 China
 coming
 out
 this
 morning
 and


kind
 of
 denying
 that
 they
 want
 those


chips.
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 Nvidia
 is


getting
 hit
 right
 here
 at
 184
 63.
 And
 by


the
 way,
 if
 if
 Nvidia
 can
 sell
 their


chips,
 AMD
 will
 be
 able
 to
 sell
 their


last
 generation
 of
 chips
 as
 well.
 Maybe


not
 the
 MI450,
 but
 that
 should
 still
 be


accrative
 to
 AMD.
 Crowd
 Strike
 right


there,
 528.
 That's
 green.
 Robin
 Hood


really
 holding
 on
 today.
 138.


I
 mean,
 Bitcoin
 and
 ETH
 are
 holding
 on


as
 well.
 Those
 candles
 have
 not
 faded.


They
 tried
 to,
 but
 they
 have
 not
 really


got
 hit.
 BMR


making
 a
 move
 up
 1.19%.
 Even
 Micro


Strategy


back
 from
 150
 to
 183


over
 the
 past
 week.


M
 when
 would
 you
 buy
 more
 SoFi?


Honestly,
 I
 think


I
 think
 it's
 now,
 right?
 Like


re
 realistically


I
 I
 think
 the
 the
 the
 the
 exciting
 dip


on
 SoFi
 is
 below
 25.
 We
 had
 that


opportunity
 two
 weeks
 ago,
 which
 I


didn't
 get
 at
 at
 23.
 Some
 of
 you
 guys


probably
 got
 it,
 but
 we
 did
 see
 below
 25


when
 everything
 was
 falling.
 I
 don't


know if
 we
 easily
 see
 below
 25
 with
 fear


and
 greed
 not
 being
 at
 extreme
 fear


anymore.
 So
 then
 the
 question
 is,
 do
 you


think
 they
 have
 an
 endofear
 run
 based
 on


that
 rate
 cut?
 And
 if
 you
 think
 the
 rate


cut
 is
 priced
 in
 and
 the
 market's
 not


going
 to
 move
 that
 much,
 then
 maybe
 SoFi


doesn't
 have
 a
 big
 run
 coming
 up.
 The


reason
 the
 rate
 cuts
 are
 bullish
 for


them
 is
 because
 yes,
 their
 net
 interest


income
 will
 go
 down
 because
 rates
 will


come
 down,
 but
 the
 volume
 of
 refinancing


activity
 that
 they
 should
 see
 should
 be


massive.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 so
 is
 an
 easy


long
 into
 2026.
 Like
 I
 don't know
 if


it's
 a
 double
 or
 anything
 or
 if
 it
 makes


like
 that
 crazy
 crazy
 move,
 but
 I
 think


this
 stock
 is
 closer
 to
 40
 bucks
 by
 the


end
 of
 2026.
 At least
 closer
 to
 35.
 And


I
 don't
 think
 you
 have
 to
 lose
 too
 much


sleep
 at
 night
 owning
 this
 one.
 Now,


maybe
 there'll
 be
 some
 opportunity
 cost


in
 the
 short
 term
 if
 other
 names
 are


doing
 better,
 but
 I
 continue
 to
 hold
 all


my
 SoFi.
 I
 really
 am
 not
 nervous
 of


holding
 SoFi
 here.


I
 just
 think
 that
 massive
 move
 that


people
 have
 been
 waiting
 for
 has
 not


happened
 yet.
 Now
 again,
 Noto
 has
 a
 lot


of
 incentives.
 If
 this
 thing
 gets
 to
 45


for
 like
 60
 days
 by
 June,


then
 uh
 you
 know
 he
 makes
 like
 half
 a


billion
 dollars
 or
 something.
 So


he's
 definitely
 incentivized
 even
 though


we've
 seen
 more
 dilution
 to
 to
 get
 this


stock
 to
 go
 higher.
 Amazon
 goes
 green
 on


the
 day
 227.
 Amazon
 trying
 to
 get
 back


to

 and
 then
 Nvidia

 Google


at
 312.


Man,
 when
 would
 you
 consider
 cutting


grab?
 I
 I
 just
 I
 don't
 think
 Okay,
 so


when
 I
 think
 of
 cutting
 a
 stock,
 and
 we


were
 talking
 about
 this
 last
 night
 on


the
 stream
 with
 the
 rapper
 because
 he


has
 like


120
 positions.
 It's
 like
 kind
 of
 stupid


how
 many
 positions
 he
 has.
 And
 so
 he
 was


like,
 "When
 would
 you
 get
 rid
 of
 a


stock?"
 I
 would
 get
 rid
 of
 a
 stock.
 A,


if
 there's
 so
 little
 amount
 of
 money
 in


it
 that
 it's
 minuscule,
 like
 you
 know,


it's
 less
 than
 a
 certain
 amount
 of


dollars
 relative
 to
 your
 portfolio.
 It


doesn't
 matter.
 Um,
 that's
 one
 reason.


Number
 two
 is
 like
 you
 don't
 know
 what


the
 company
 does.
 is
 you
 can't
 explain


what
 the
 company
 does.
 So
 it's
 like
 why


do
 you
 own
 this
 stock?
 It's
 like
 oh
 you


saw
 some
 commercial
 about
 it's
 like
 okay


if
 you
 don't
 really
 have
 a
 thesis
 you


should
 probably
 get
 rid
 of
 it.
 And
 then


three
 something
 in
 the
 fundamentals


changed.
 Nothing
 has
 changed
 with
 Grab.


Absolutely
 nothing.
 The
 fundamentals


have
 only
 gotten
 better
 and
 better
 and


better.
 So
 to
 me
 this
 it
 really
 I
 hate


to
 make
 the
 comparison
 but
 it
 reminds
 me


of
 Hood
 when
 it
 was
 stuck
 at
 $7
 for
 two


years
 or
 pound.
 I'm
 not
 saying
 it's


going
 to
 make
 that
 type
 of
 a
 move
 but


we've
 had
 some
 names
 that
 have
 been


stuck
 for
 a
 long
 time
 until
 the
 market


recognized
 it.
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 the


market's
 not
 recognizing
 right
 now.
 I


didn't
 know
 in
 2022
 why
 the
 market


wasn't
 recognizing
 Palinger
 after
 Karp


was
 meeting
 with
 Zillinsky,
 you
 know,


like
 but
 still
 Karp
 first
 public
 CEO
 to


meet
 with
 Zillinsky.
 Stocks
 stuck
 at


650.


Like
 sometimes
 you
 really
 just
 don't


know.
 So
 unless
 the
 fundamentals
 change,


which
 I
 don't
 see
 the
 fundamentals


changing
 in
 front
 of
 me.
 It's
 hard
 for


me
 to
 cut
 bait,


but
 I
 have
 to
 see
 if
 that
 plays
 out.
 No,


I'm
 not
 rolling
 my
 option
 spreads


either.
 I
 still
 think
 $10
 by
 2027
 is


possible.
 And
 remember,
 we
 don't
 have
 to


get
 to
 10.
 If
 we
 get
 closer
 to
 like


7750,
 the
 options
 still
 uh
 are
 going
 to


do
 very
 well.
 So,
 as
 of
 now,
 I'm
 not


rolling
 those.
 I
 like
 I
 think
 we
 got
 to


let
 this
 play
 out
 over
 the
 next
 couple


months
 and
 see.
 But
 I
 haven't
 got
 a


fundamental
 thesis
 to
 change.
 And
 if
 I


see
 it,
 then,
 you
 know,
 I'll
 cut
 bait,


but
 I'm
 not
 seeing
 that
 yet.


And
 so,
 you
 know,
 that
 that
 would
 be
 my


philosophical
 thesis
 on
 when
 to
 cut
 a


stock.
 Now,
 if
 you
 hate
 the
 price
 action


being
 stagnant,
 I
 understand
 that.


That's
 totally


a
 reasonable
 argument
 for
 why
 you
 want


to
 get
 rid
 of
 a
 name,
 not
 just
 Grab,
 but


any
 name
 that,
 you
 know,
 PayPal's
 in


this
 category
 as
 well.
 Uh
 the
 question


is,
 you
 know,
 do
 you
 think
 the
 price


action
 is
 stagnant
 and
 there's
 a


nonfunddamental
 story
 that
 is
 not


matching
 up
 to
 the
 price
 action
 or
 do


you
 think
 the
 fundamentals
 are
 so
 good


that
 the
 price
 action
 being
 stagnant


creates
 a
 really
 good
 opportunity?


That's
 like
 the
 age-old
 question
 of
 how


you
 hold
 a
 stock
 or
 not.


And
 if
 you
 think
 there's
 a
 better


opportunity,
 then
 you
 know
 that's
 where


you
 have
 to
 make
 a
 decision.
 Nebas
 right


here,
 that
 one
 9858
 still
 down
 about
 2%


on
 the
 day.
 It
 did
 break
 a
 100


yesterday.
 102,


but
 that
 one's
 back
 down.
 Is
 Carvana


overvalued?
 Honestly,
 I
 have
 never


understood
 this
 business.
 I
 agree
 with


Steve.
 I
 like
 it's
 it's
 a
 vending


machine
 for
 cars.
 It's
 kind
 of
 crazy


that
 they've
 had
 the
 success
 they've


had,
 but
 you
 know,
 the
 people
 that


obviously
 saw
 something
 in
 this
 uh


deserve
 the
 gains
 that
 they
 have.
 Never


looked
 at
 the
 numbers.


127%
 year-to
 date.
 They
 went
 to
 350


bucks
 in
 2021,
 fell
 to
 $4,
 and
 since


then
 they've
 100xed


to
 450.


So,
 I
 don't
 know
 enough
 about
 them,
 but


I
 I
 will
 not
 disrespect
 them
 because


this
 is
 not
 a
 meme
 stock.
 You
 don't
 you


don't
 pull
 off
 a
 100x
 being
 a
 meme


stock.
 There's
 obviously
 something
 very


strong
 in
 the
 growth
 story


and
 they've
 been
 able
 to,


you
 know,
 grow
 the
 way
 that
 they've
 been


growing.


Yes,
 I
 know
 it's
 a
 marketplace
 for


buying
 and
 selling
 used
 cars.
 I
 just


still
 didn't
 think
 that
 would
 be
 that


much
 of
 a
 growth
 story
 to
 the
 street,


but
 it's
 turned
 into
 one
 of
 the
 best


growth
 stories
 we've
 seen
 in
 an
 entire


entire
 past
 decade.


Um,


okay.
 Well,
 the
 debt
 manipulation


argument,
 that's
 Chenos's
 argument
 for


why
 he
 was
 short
 Carvana,
 which
 I
 still


think
 he's
 short
 Carvana.
 I
 mean,
 he
 he


got
 the
 micro
 strategy
 short
 correct


this
 year.
 He
 got
 the
 Carvana
 short


wrong.
 I
 I
 don't
 know if
 he's
 still


short,
 but
 I
 think
 in
 June
 he
 announced


or
 July
 that
 he
 was
 short
 both
 of
 those


names
 publicly.


So,
 one
 of
 those
 has
 blown
 up
 in
 his


face.
 But
 yeah,
 his
 argument
 is
 they've


completely
 cooked
 the
 books.
 I
 just


don't
 understand
 how
 you
 can
 get
 into


the
 S&P
 500
 and
 100x
 your
 stock
 by


cooking
 the
 books.
 That's
 why
 all
 these


people
 screaming
 that
 Nvidia
 is
 cooking


the
 books.
 It's
 like,
 no,
 they're
 not.


Like
 I
 hate
 to
 break
 it
 to
 you,
 but


they're
 not
 cooking
 that.
 Like
 you
 you


can't
 be
 under
 that
 level
 of
 scrutiny


and
 quarter
 after
 quarter
 after
 quarter


continue
 putting
 up
 these
 numbers
 and


it's
 all
 fake.


Like
 yes,
 we've
 seen
 that
 happen


sometimes
 in
 history,
 but
 the
 idea
 that


it's
 happening
 at
 the
 scale
 that
 it's


happening
 for
 a
 company
 like
 Nvidia,
 I


just
 I
 just
 it's
 hard
 to
 believe
 that.


It's
 really
 hard
 to
 believe
 that.


>> And
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 people
 bring


up
 depreciation
 numbers
 as
 like
 their


lynch
 pin.
 It's
 like
 these
 aren't
 even


good
 arguments
 and
 they
 don't
 even
 hold


up
 when
 you
 actually
 listen
 to
 what
 the


customers
 are
 saying
 about
 their
 GPUs.


Gold
 right
 there
 13
 cents
 away
 from


getting
 to
 60.


13
 cents
 away
 from
 getting
 to
 60.


Yeah.
 If
 you're
 going
 to
 bring
 up
 Enron


or
 Lehman
 Brothers,
 I
 mean
 again,
 you're


bringing
 up
 very
 very
 cherrypicked


scenarios
 where
 those
 companies
 were


completely
 unethical
 and
 did
 it
 the


wrong
 way.
 At
 that
 point,
 you're


accusing
 Jensen
 Wong
 of
 being
 a
 fraud.
 I


mean,
 like
 that
 that's
 what
 it
 is.


You're
 accusing
 Jensen
 of
 being
 a
 fraud


at
 that
 and
 like
 I
 disagree.
 I
 do
 I
 just


fundamentally


I
 don't
 think
 Nvidia
 is
 a
 fraud.
 You're


going
 to
 make
 an
 Enron
 comparison.
 It's


like,
 okay,
 outside
 of
 the
 the


quantitative
 metrics
 not
 really
 lining


up
 with
 Enron.
 I
 mean,
 compared
 to


Nvidia,
 it
 just
 looks
 kind
 of
 stupid


comparing
 the
 numbers,
 but
 then
 you


essentially
 it's
 a
 character
 argument.


You're
 making
 it
 on
 Jensen.


I
 just
 disagree.


I
 keep
 saying
 gold.
 Sorry,
 I
 meant


silver.
 I
 meant
 silver.


Silver
 at
 60.


To
 be
 fair,
 Leman
 wasn't
 a
 fraud.
 Just


dumb.
 That's
 also
 true.
 I
 I
 watched
 The


Big
 Short.
 I
 think
 I
 watched
 The
 Big


Short
 for
 the
 fifth
 time.
 I
 watched
 it


with
 my
 cousin
 because
 she's
 never


watched
 it
 last
 week.
 Uh
 I
 really
 do


think
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 best
 movies
 of


all
 time.
 Like
 I
 love
 that
 movie
 and
 I


guess
 I'm
 a
 stock
 market
 guy
 so
 you
 know


it
 gets
 my
 attention.
 But


um
 yeah,
 I
 mean
 when
 it
 happened
 it
 was


aggressive
 and
 for
 us
 to
 have
 like
 a


2008
 type
 of
 crisis
 again
 that's
 being


bolstered
 by
 Nvidia
 just
 seems
 unlikely.


Bitcoin
 really
 making
 a
 move
 right
 here.


Trying
 to
 get
 up
 to

hoodie
 that's
 helping
 Coinbase
 Micro


Strategy
 Ethereum
 as
 well.
 Looks
 like


that
 move
 from
 Jolts
 is
 not
 being
 faded


yet.
 A
 lot
 of
 us
 thought
 it
 would
 be


faded.
 Coinbase
 at
 279
 not
 getting
 faded


yet.


Maybe
 it
 continues
 to


hold
 on.
 Clean
 Spark,


is
 that
 one
 going
 higher?
 Yep,
 Clean


Spark's
 up
 4.8%.


Is
 that's
 holding
 up?
 Yes,
 I've
 seen


Wall
 Street
 1987.


That
 was
 a
 great
 movie
 as
 well.
 The


remake
 in
 2010
 sucked.


Even
 though
 they
 had
 some
 of
 the
 same


characters,
 but
 the
 1987
 one
 was
 a
 legit


movie.
 ASST,


how's
 that
 one
 doing?


Slightly
 green
 on
 the
 day.
 That's
 under


a
 dollar.
 And
 then

 to

name.


That
 one's
 not
 really
 made
 an
 aggressive


move
 either.
 Marll.
 Wow.
 Marll
 down
 from


100.
 This
 one's
 also
 not
 in
 the
 S&P
 500


yet,
 which
 I
 was
 surprised.
 I
 thought


they
 were
 in
 the
 S&P,
 but
 they
 had
 a


pretty
 strong
 earnings.


This
 one
 could
 not
 make


could
 not
 make
 that
 move
 yet.
 Um,
 okay.


Let's
 get
 some
 more
 cover
 on
 this
 Fed


meeting.
 I'm
 going
 to
 put
 the
 official


poll
 in
 the
 chat
 on
 if
 people
 think


we're
 going
 to
 get
 the
 rate
 cut
 or
 not.


And
 let's
 see
 what
 we
 think.
 Again,
 89%


is
 the
 Fed
 futures
 probability


on
 us
 getting
 this
 rate
 cut.


>> I
 think
 they
 should
 cut.
 I
 think
 they


will
 be
 hawkish
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 rhetoric


following
 that
 cut
 in
 the
 press


conference.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 they


should
 be.
 Um
 I
 think
 they
 should
 be


very
 very
 patient
 and
 allow
 for
 the


official
 data
 to
 come
 through
 to
 see
 and


lay
 bear
 exactly
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the


labor
 market.
 My
 strong
 suspicion
 is


that
 the
 labor
 market
 is
 weaker
 than
 it


looks
 under
 the
 surface.
 will
 get
 a
 lot


of
 this
 information
 over
 the
 course
 of


the
 first
 few
 weeks
 and
 couple
 months
 of


2026
 and
 I
 do
 think
 that
 the
 Fed
 will


ultimately
 embark
 on
 a
 deeper
 easing


cycle
 than
 the
 market
 currently
 has.


>> So
 you
 see
 you
 see
 unemployment
 the
 rate


rising
 dramatically.


>> Uh
 not
 dramatically
 but
 steadily
 and


impactful
 enough
 so
 this
 becomes
 the
 A1


focus
 of
 the
 Fed.
 I
 think
 inflation
 will


continue
 to
 migrate
 towards
 target


probably
 by
 mid
 late
 of
 next
 year,
 but
 I


think
 the
 labor
 market
 is
 going
 to
 come


into
 view
 much
 more
 sharply
 and
 I
 think


the
 Fed
 will
 be
 very
 very
 keen
 to


counteract
 negative
 pressures
 there
 very


quickly
 and
 we'll
 move
 into
 a
 more


easing
 posture
 pretty
 soon
 into
 the
 new


year.


agree
 with
 everything
 you
 just
 said,
 but


then
 we
 get
 a
 a
 job
 openings
 report
 like


this,
 which
 was
 very
 strong
 in
 terms
 of


the
 amount
 of
 openings,
 or
 the
 weekly


unemployment
 claims
 number,
 which
 is


historically
 low
 and
 bodess
 pretty
 well,


or
 or
 job
 growth,
 which
 is
 still


happening
 even
 though
 we
 don't
 have
 the


last
 few
 months
 of
 data.
 So,
 it's
 kind


of
 mixed
 messages.


>> Yeah,
 there's
 noise
 in
 the
 the


alternative
 data.
 There's
 noise
 in
 some


of
 the
 official
 data,
 and
 none
 of
 this


is
 going to
 be
 in
 a
 straight
 line


because
 it
 never
 is.
 But
 I
 do
 strongly


suspect
 that
 as
 we
 move
 into
 next
 year,


some
 of
 the
 productivity
 gains
 that


we'll
 see
 as
 a
 function
 of
 technology


and
 AI
 adoption
 will
 really
 be
 felt
 and


as
 a
 result
 that
 labor
 market
 weakness


and
 labor
 market
 rebalancing
 rebalancing


that
 will
 need
 to
 take
 place
 will
 need


to
 be
 assisted
 by
 meaningfully
 easier


monetary
 policy.


>> Even
 if
 it
 means
 stubbornly
 high


inflation,


>> I
 don't
 think
 inflation
 will
 be


stubbornly
 high.


>> You
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 come
 down?


>> I
 think
 those
 productivity
 gains
 will


allow
 the
 cost
 of
 goods
 sold
 to
 go
 down.


I
 think
 that
 will
 be
 a
 net
 win
 for
 the


consumer.
 I
 think
 it'll
 be
 a
 net
 win
 for


margins.
 And
 so
 overall,
 like
 to
 be


clear,
 I'm
 actually
 really
 bullish


growth
 in
 2026.


>> Why?


>> So
 I
 think
 that
 the
 ongoing
 um
 movement


of
 the
 economic
 growth
 going
 in
 one


direction,
 but
 the
 labor
 market
 going
 in


another
 direction.
 I
 don't
 even
 think


we've
 gotten
 started
 on
 how
 that
 move
 is


going
 to
 develop.


>> High
 GDP,


>> high
 GDP,
 high
 unemployment,
 requirement


to
 move
 interest
 rates
 sharply
 lower


than
 they
 are
 today.
 And
 I
 think
 it's


going
 to
 be
 driven
 by
 the
 adoption
 of
 AI


and
 other
 technological
 advances
 in
 the


corporate
 sector.
 We're
 at
 the
 very
 very


early
 innings
 of
 it.
 But
 I'm
 more
 in
 the


Elon
 Musk
 camp
 of
 this
 being
 a
 huge


unlock
 of
 productivity,
 a
 huge
 benefit


to
 the
 overall
 consumer
 and
 to
 the
 real


economy.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 like
 all
 of


these
 things
 together,
 great
 growth,


lower
 interest
 rates,
 terrific
 for
 the


US
 government
 as
 we
 think
 about
 the


fiscal
 balance
 as
 well.


>> That'd
 be
 nice.
 Are
 you
 using
 AI
 uh
 in


your
 daily
 work?
 bits
 and
 pieces
 here


and
 there.


>> Just
 bits
 and
 pieces.
 So,
 you're
 talking


bullishly
 about
 it,
 but
 you're
 not


really
 using
 it
 much.


>> Yeah.
 Because
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 the


unlock
 of
 the
 value
 for
 the
 US
 economy


is
 necessarily
 what
 we
 adopt.
 I
 think


it's
 much
 broader
 in
 the
 real
 economy.


We
 obviously
 are
 uh
 developing
 certain


tools
 that
 I
 think
 over
 the
 course
 of


the
 next
 6
 12
 months
 are
 going to
 be


much
 more
 impactful
 to
 all
 of
 our


workflows.
 I'm
 using
 it
 as
 said
 in
 a


limited
 fashion.
 There's
 others
 in
 the


organization
 that
 are
 using
 it
 in
 a
 more


meaningful
 fashion.
 Um,
 but
 it's
 going


to
 continue
 to
 develop
 and
 change
 the


way
 that
 all
 of
 us
 go
 about
 our
 daily


lives.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 I
 I
 can't
 imagine
 that
 won't


be
 the
 case.
 So,
 getting
 back
 to
 your


business.
 Yeah.


>> Trying
 to
 sell
 bonds
 for
 uh
 investment


grade.


>> Silver
 hits
 60


59.99
 just
 touched
 60
 for
 a
 second.
 And


Bitcoin
 and
 ETH
 are
 running.
 All right.


So
 I
 guess
 the
 commodities


and
 the
 digital
 commodities
 Bitcoin
 at


92


are
 liking
 either
 the
 Jolts
 data
 or
 the


anticipation
 of
 a
 rate
 cut.
 BMR
 Hood,


Micro
 Strategy,
 Coinbase
 all
 benefiting.


BMR
 up
 3%
 on
 the
 day
 as
 we
 are
 seeing


these


catch
 a
 bid
 this
 morning.


>> Trade
 rated
 companies.
 What
 are
 your


expectations
 for
 next
 year?
 here.
 I


mean,
 you
 see
 a
 deal
 in
 in
 my
 world,
 you


know,
 Netflix,
 obviously,
 huge
 bridge


facilities,
 they'll
 get
 taken
 out
 at


some
 point,
 potentially
 by
 by
 the
 bond


market
 as
 well.
 Is
 that
 your
 expectation


for
 2026
 as
 we
 continue
 to
 see


potentially
 a
 lot
 of
 M&A?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 think
 that
 M&A
 and
 capex


will
 continue
 to
 be
 the
 big
 drivers
 of


IG
 financing
 around
 the
 world.
 And
 so,


we'll
 close
 the
 year
 in
 the
 US
 around


1.8
 trillion
 of
 financing
 done.
 We'll
 be


north
 of
 two
 trillion
 over
 the
 course
 of


2026.
 We've
 had
 roughly
 $140
 billion
 of


M&A
 related
 financing
 in
 the
 US
 this


year.
 As
 you
 look
 forward
 over
 the
 next


12
 months
 from
 what's
 being
 publicly


announced
 and
 what's
 either
 been
 bridged


or
 companies
 have
 stated
 their
 intention


to
 use
 debt
 financing
 markets,
 there's


already
 140
 billion
 there
 and
 that's


before
 the
 other
 announcements
 that


we'll
 get
 in
 the
 coming
 weeks
 and


months,
 much
 of
 which
 will
 find
 its
 way


into
 the
 bond
 market
 next
 year.
 So
 that


number
 will
 be
 north
 of
 $200
 billion
 and


it
 could
 eclipse
 the
 records
 that
 we've


seen
 for
 acquisition
 financing.
 And
 from


a
 capex
 perspective,
 you've
 seen
 $140


billion
 of
 hyperscaler
 financing
 in


2025.
 That
 was
 about
 25
 billion
 the
 year


before.
 And
 80%
 of
 that
 volume
 has


happened
 since
 Labor
 Day.
 That's
 clearly


going
 to
 be
 a
 much
 bigger
 number.
 It


could
 be
 a
 double
 over
 the
 course
 of


next
 year.
 You
 put
 those
 pieces


together,
 that's
 a
 very
 clear
 path
 to
 a


two
 trillion
 plus
 number.


>> Wow.


>> I
 mean,
 it's
 not
 a
 crazy
 thesis.
 It
 is


similar
 to
 what


um
 Oppenheimer
 said
 yesterday.
 8,100
 is


their
 target.
 They
 expect
 the
 Fed
 to


cut.
 They
 expect
 earnings
 to
 be
 strong


and
 they
 are
 assuming
 a
 26.5
 forward


projected
 multiple
 on
 the
 S&P
 500
 at
 $35


a
 share.
 26.5
 times
 gets
 you
 to
 8,100


by
 the
 end
 of
 uh
 2026.


Again,


we
 look
 at
 a
 lot
 of
 data
 on
 this
 show


every
 morning
 and
 while
 there
 have
 been


bearish
 things
 that
 we
 cannot
 avoid


looking
 at,
 the
 trend
 is
 still
 AI
 trade


fed
 easing.
 Now,
 if
 that
 creates
 an


asset
 bubble
 is
 a
 different
 question,


but
 will
 it
 create
 excitement
 for


capital
 to
 be
 put
 into
 more
 risk
 on


plays
 that
 that
 ultimately
 need
 to
 grow


to
 show
 return
 to
 investors?
 Yeah,
 I


think
 it
 it
 sets
 up
 that
 frame
 that
 that


framework
 going
 into
 2026,


which
 whether
 you
 like
 it
 or
 hate
 it,
 it


does
 feel
 like
 that
 could
 play
 out.


Ethereum
 right
 there
 at
 3200.
 Bitcoin
 at


92,000.
 Silver
 still
 moving.
 Gold
 still


moving.
 Micro
 Strategy
 and
 BMR
 both


strategy
 up
 2%
 on
 the
 day.
 Hoodie,
 are


we
 past
 138?
 We
 are
 at
 137.
 SoFi
 still


down
 1.3.
 Nvidia
 still
 down.
 Amcor
 back


at
 44.
 And
 then
 the
 S&P
 basically
 flat


on
 the
 day.
 So
 realistically,
 it's


Bitcoin,
 Ethereum,
 gold,
 and
 silver
 that


are
 moving
 the
 most
 today.
 IN's
 getting


a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 pump
 right
 here.
 Their


dilution
 is
 now
 done.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 we


we
 talked
 about
 this
 last
 week.
 The


dilution,
 even
 when
 the
 news
 came
 out,


was
 not
 a
 big
 deal.
 Like,
 these
 are


capital
 intensive
 businesses
 if
 you're


going
 to
 enter
 and
 become
 a
 Neocloud.


And
 so,
 it
 shouldn't
 be
 a
 surprise
 when


they
 have
 to
 issue
 convertible
 notes.


This
 one
 getting
 closer
 to
 50
 seems


reasonable
 given
 they
 they
 pretty
 much


told
 the
 street
 they
 were
 going
 to
 do


what
 they
 did.
 They
 did
 it.
 The
 street


got
 upset
 and
 now
 the
 street
 isn't
 that


upset.
 Clean
 Spark
 that's
 up
 7%
 on
 the


day
 and
 then
 Carbana


still
 up
 2%
 on
 the
 day.
 APLD
 yeah
 the


data
 center
 plays


continuing
 to
 move


up
 4.5%.


Uh,
 Chad
 says,
 "I'll
 take
 a
 nice
 big


sell
 off
 after
 I
 get
 my
 Christmas


bonus."


Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 January
 is
 a
 mixed


bag
 sometimes.
 January
 tends
 to
 be


really
 good
 in
 certain
 sectors
 like


small
 caps,
 but
 it
 also
 tends
 to
 be
 bad


in
 names
 that
 have
 had
 massive
 gains
 in


the
 year
 before
 because
 people
 don't


want
 to
 sell
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year


because
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 pay
 their


taxes,
 but
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 be


obligated
 to
 pay
 the
 taxes
 into
 the


following
 year.
 So,
 they
 sell
 the
 year


after
 or
 the
 month
 after,
 which
 is


January,
 and
 they
 delay
 some
 of
 their


taxes.
 So,
 I
 think
 my
 biggest
 fear
 for


January
 was
 another
 shutdown.
 Given
 some


of
 the
 stuff
 Trump
 has
 been
 saying
 about


healthcare,
 I
 think
 we
 I
 think
 we
 avoid


the
 shutdown
 in
 January.
 I
 think
 the


Democrats
 and
 Republicans
 come
 to
 some


level
 of
 agreement
 on
 what
 ACA
 subsidies


will
 look
 like
 and
 I
 think
 that
 sets
 up


a
 much
 better
 chance
 of
 the
 first
 half


of
 2026
 being
 better
 than
 expected.


Bitcoin
 really
 making
 a
 move
 right
 here.


92.5


trying
 to
 get
 up
 to
 93.


That
 was
 my
 deeper
 concern
 going
 into
 uh


going
 going
 into
 January.


Um


7thb,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Thoughts
 on
 Redwire
 feels
 like
 the


purist
 pixel
 play
 on
 orbital
 data


centers
 plus
 broader
 space
 infra
 boom.


Any
 favorite
 ODC
 names?
 You
 know,


Redwire
 is
 a
 name
 that
 Jason
 has
 also


liked
 for
 a
 while.
 I
 have
 not
 done
 a
 big


deep
 dive
 into
 their
 financials.
 I


actually
 visited
 one
 of
 their
 suppliers


in
 California
 with
 Jason
 because
 he
 has


a
 buddy
 that
 that
 works
 for
 a
 couple
 of


these
 companies.
 He's
 like
 works
 at
 a
 a


vendor
 that
 contracts
 with
 Rocket
 Lab


and
 Redwire
 and
 they
 were
 pretty
 bullish


on
 Red
 Wire
 as
 well.
 I
 think
 when
 it


comes
 to
 like
 data
 centers
 in
 space


right
 now,
 it's
 an
 idea
 that
 everyone's


been
 talking
 about.
 It's
 not
 really


material.
 Now,
 do
 I
 think
 it
 will
 become


material?
 Yes.
 because
 I
 think
 you
 have


too
 many
 smart
 people
 talking
 like


Sundar
 and
 Jensen
 and
 Bezos
 that
 and


Elon
 obviously
 that
 it
 can
 become
 real.


I
 think
 it
 might
 be
 a
 little
 early
 to


try
 to
 get
 exposure
 to
 it
 when
 you
 know


data
 centers
 in
 the
 US
 haven't
 even


gotten
 close
 to
 being
 fully
 built
 out.


So
 I
 definitely
 do
 think
 there's


potential
 there
 but
 not
 sure
 if
 Redwire


as
 a
 play
 just
 for
 the
 Piction
 from
 that


perspective
 is
 the
 best
 opportunity


here.
 But
 I
 have
 to
 look
 at
 their


financials.
 I
 mean,
 billion
 dollar


market
 cap.
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 how
 much


revenue
 these
 guys
 do.
 So,
 we
 would
 have


to
 go
 deeper
 to
 see
 that.
 Bitcoin
 really


trying
 to
 make
 a
 move
 back
 to
 93.


Really
 trying
 to
 make
 a
 move
 back
 to
 93.


Same
 thing
 with
 Ethereum.
 When's
 the


last
 time
 we
 saw
 3250?


No,
 it's
 the
 highest
 it's
 been
 since


November
 15th.


We
 kind
 of
 got
 close
 to
 that
 on
 December


3rd,
 but
 weren't
 able
 to
 really
 get
 back


to
 those
 levels.
 So
 almost
 the
 highest


it's
 been
 in
 a
 month
 is
 what
 we're


seeing
 on
 ETH.
 Someone
 just
 sold
 10


million
 worth
 of
 puts
 on
 Nvidia
 at
 187


for
 January
 16,
 2026.


Okay.
 So
 you
 got
 some
 out-of-the
 money


puts
 being
 sold
 on
 Nvidia


for
 about
 a
 month
 out.
 Why
 is
 Duolingo


pumping?
 I
 don't
 know,
 but
 please
 keep


pumping


because
 I
 need
 my
 stock
 draft


to
 have
 Dualingo
 recover.


Okay,
 now
 we're
 only
 down
 55%
 on


Duolingo.


There
 you
 go.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 don't
 know


why
 it's
 pumping,
 but
 this
 thing
 did
 it


deserve
 to
 be
 at
 150,
 like
 down
 from


570.
 At
 some
 point,
 this
 thing
 needed
 to


make
 a
 reversal.
 So,
 we're
 up
 32%.


Matt's
 at
 25.
 Tanner's
 at
 21.
 Steve's
 at


five.
 And
 then
 Chris
 is
 at
 six.


That's
 what
 we
 have
 on
 the
 stock
 draft.


I
 think
 you
 are
 the
 only
 one
 following


the
 stock
 draft.
 Does
 no
 one
 else
 care


that
 we
 did
 this
 thing?
 Made
 a
 whole
 big


stream
 out
 of
 it.
 Made
 it
 such
 a
 big


deal.


I
 guess
 I
 guess
 we
 got
 to
 do
 a
 2026
 one


as
 well.


Joseph
 Carlson
 sold
 10
 million
 of
 puts


on
 Duolingo.


Oh
 my
 gosh,
 dude.
 He
 really
 wants


Netflix
 to
 win
 this
 freaking
 Paramount


or
 the
 Warner
 Brothers
 deal.
 And
 I


understand.
 First
 of all,
 for
 those
 that


don't
 know,
 Carlson's
 been
 long
 Netflix


since
 like
 $10
 or
 since
 before
 that,
 but


when
 it
 fell
 to
 10
 back
 in
 2022,
 he


really
 doubled
 down.
 and
 you
 know
 stock


is
 10x
 since
 then
 so
 he
 deserves
 all
 the


praise
 for
 that
 but
 he
 believes
 and
 I


think
 he
 rightfully
 knows
 as
 a
 Netflix


shareholder
 this
 is
 a
 once
 in
 a-lifetime


opportunity
 there's
 not
 many
 times
 you


get
 to
 buy
 Harry
 Potter
 like
 there's


just
 not
 many
 times
 it
 goes
 for
 sale
 so


if
 you're
 a
 Netflix
 bull
 you
 really
 want


this
 to
 work
 out


and
 if
 you're
 just
 sitting
 on
 the


sidelines
 you
 know
 you
 get
 the
 time
 to


wait
 and
 see
 if
 they
 can
 actually
 make


this
 a
 creative


but
 I
 can
 understand
 why
 he
 wants
 is
 to


to
 become
 a
 thing.


I
 think
 we
 might
 do
 the
 2026
 draft
 on


New
 Year's
 Eve
 to
 be
 honest.
 We
 might
 do


something
 like
 that.
 We're
 going
 to
 see.


We
 got
 to
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 everybody


together,


but
 we
 might
 do
 something
 like
 that.


Hood
 still
 at
 138.


Um


APLD
 going
 up
 to
 34.
 A
 lot
 of
 data


center
 plays
 still
 moving.
 Yeah,
 look
 at


that.
 3394


up
 6%.


Um,


crypto
 still
 moving
 as
 well.
 Silver
 at


60,
 that's
 not
 stopping.
 SMCI,
 I
 don't


know
 why
 these
 guys
 haven't
 moved,


especially
 with
 Dell.
 I
 mean,
 I
 know


their
 guidance
 wasn't
 amazing,
 but


I
 mean,
 we
 need
 a
 lot
 of
 servers
 for


these
 GPUs.
 So,
 I'm
 not
 sure
 why
 that


one
 hasn't
 made
 that
 big
 of a
 move,
 but


I
 guess
 the
 lack
 of
 quarterly
 guidance


versus
 their
 fiscal
 year
 guidance
 is


what
 kind
 of
 scared
 the
 street.


Maybe
 the
 street
 kind
 of
 just
 rotated


that
 money
 outside
 of
 some
 of the
 server


plays.
 I
 ran
 right
 there
 trying
 to
 push


49.
 That's
 up
 3.6.


And
 then
 Micro
 Strategy
 at
 188.


um


deadcat
 bounce
 happening,
 you
 know?
 I


think
 this
 week
 is
 going
 to
 be


interesting,
 dude,
 because


like
 yesterday
 was
 kind
 of
 flat
 and
 then


Nvidia
 news
 after
 hours
 made
 it
 green,


then
 pre-markets
 were
 red.
 Now
 we're


kind
 of
 green.
 A
 lot
 of
 this
 depends
 on


the
 Fed,
 but
 as
 a
 lot
 of
 you
 guys
 voted


in
 the
 chat,
 which
 who
 voted
 for
 a
 25


basis
 point
 hike?


Like
 what
 3%
 of
 people
 voted
 for
 a
 hike?


But
 if
 we
 if
 we
 do
 get
 a
 hike,
 there's


definitely
 a
 dead
 cap
 bounce.
 But
 even


if
 we
 don't
 get
 a
 hike,
 if
 we
 get
 a
 cut,


I
 wonder
 if
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 uh
 enough


to
 make
 us
 move
 forward.


I
 put
 that
 in
 there
 just
 to
 see
 if


anyone
 would
 vote
 on
 it.


I
 guess
 some
 people
 thought


we
 would.
 Could
 you
 imagine
 if
 JPAL


comes
 out
 and
 like,
 "Guys,
 inflation
 is


the
 issue.
 I
 don't know
 what
 you
 guys


have
 been
 talking
 about,
 but
 inflation


is
 a
 concern.
 The
 hell
 are
 you
 guys


thinking
 we
 were
 going
 to
 cut?


Um,


and
 then
 boom,


that
 would
 definitely
 be
 some
 coal


underneath
 the
 Christmas
 tree.
 Trump


just
 tweeted,


um,
 well,
 he
 didn't
 just
 tweet,
 but
 this


is
 the
 latest
 tweet.
 Because
 of
 tariffs


easily
 and
 quickly
 applied,
 our
 national


security
 has
 been
 greatly
 enhanced
 and


we
 have
 become
 financially
 the
 strongest


country
 by
 far.
 Anywhere
 in
 the
 world,


only
 dark
 and
 sinister
 forces
 would
 want


to
 see
 that
 end.


Again,
 it
 looks
 like
 he
 is
 gearing
 up


for
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 to
 give
 them
 a


pretty
 ugly
 decision
 on
 tariffs.


I
 don't
 know
 how
 the
 market's
 going
 to


react
 to
 it,
 dude.
 I
 think
 the
 market's


going
 to
 like
 that
 the
 tariffs


are
 unconstitutional,
 but
 I
 also
 think


the
 markets
 might
 feel
 it's
 a
 bit


chaotic
 if
 we
 have
 to
 reverse
 some
 of


these
 tariffs.


So,
 I
 genuinely
 am
 not
 sure
 how
 this


going
 to
 play
 out.


Um,


Trump
 would
 go
 crazy.
 I
 d
 I
 don't
 even


want
 to
 imagine
 Trump's
 reaction
 if
 we


actually
 get
 a
 rate
 hike.


I
 just
 like
 I
 wonder
 how
 fast
 the
 stock


market
 would
 fall.
 Like
 like
 if


literally
 no
 one's
 expecting
 it
 and
 JPL


says
 I
 I
 wonder
 how
 the
 velocity
 and


magnitude
 of
 a
 fall
 would
 be
 because
 we


know
 it's
 it's
 going
 downhill.


That's
 not
 going
 to
 happen.
 But
 if
 it


did,


it
 would
 be
 pretty
 crazy.
 I
 think
 we


should
 be
 get
 Supreme
 Court
 decision
 in


the
 next
 week.
 It
 should
 be
 happening


very
 soon.
 If
 not
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the


month,
 but
 more
 likely
 than
 not,
 we


should
 be
 getting
 it
 soon.
 5%
 in
 a
 day.


Yeah,
 I
 don't
 doubt
 that.
 Which
 means


individual
 stocks
 will
 be
 like
 20%.


Especially
 the
 high
 beta
 names.


Tomorrow
 we'll
 find
 out.
 Tomorrow
 we're


actually
 going
 to
 see


how
 the
 Fed
 is
 thinking
 of
 this.
 Uh
 we


have
 that
 SpaceX
 secondary
 sale
 value


the
 company
 potentially
 at
 800
 billion.


Here's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an
 update
 on
 Elon


and
 his
 personal
 wealth
 as
 per
 SpaceX.


>> Well,
 according
 to
 reports,
 SpaceX
 is


planning
 that
 secondary
 share
 sale
 that


would
 value
 the
 private
 company
 at
 $800


billion.
 So
 Elon
 stake
 would
 be
 worth


over
 $320
 billion.
 That
 assumes
 that
 40%


ownership
 in
 SpaceX
 has
 not
 changed.


Meanwhile,
 his
 direct
 shares
 in
 Tesla


are
 worth
 about
 182
 billion.
 So
 even
 if


you
 add
 in
 the
 options
 from
 that


disputed
 pay
 package
 back
 in
 2018,
 his


Tesla
 wealth
 is
 being
 far
 outpaced
 right


now
 by
 SpaceX.
 Now,
 if
 the
 SpaceX
 deal


goes
 through,
 it
 would
 bring
 his
 total


net
 worth
 to
 over
 $620
 billion.
 That


would
 make
 him
 the
 first
 person
 ever
 to


reach
 the
 $600
 billion
 mark.
 You
 might


remember
 he
 was
 the
 first
 to
 reach
 400


billion
 last
 year
 and
 the
 first
 to
 reach


500
 billion
 back
 in
 October.
 The
 rising


values
 of
 those
 private
 companies


including
 XAI,
 they
 were
 cited
 by
 the


Tesla
 board
 as
 a
 concern
 and
 reasons
 for


awarding
 Mus
 that
 pay
 package
 that
 could


potentially
 be
 worth
 $1
 trillion.
 the


Tesla
 proxy
 saying
 quote
 because
 of
 a


majority
 of
 Mus
 wealth
 is
 now
 derived


from
 other
 business
 ventures
 the


compensation
 was
 needed
 to
 quote
 prevent


him
 from
 prioritizing


those
 other
 companies
 Tesla
 shares
 down


of
 course
 3%
 yesterday


>> yeah
 you
 either
 see
 $628
 billion
 for


Elon
 and
 you
 you
 know
 you
 get
 spiteful


you
 get
 jealous
 you
 think
 no
 one
 should


have
 that
 amount
 of
 wealth
 or
 you
 see
 it


and
 you're
 like
 wow
 for
 one
 person
 to


accumulate
 that
 type
 of
 wealth.
 Bitcoin


really
 pushing
 for
 93.
 It
 means
 they
 had


to
 do
 some
 pretty


important
 [ __ ]
 in
 life.
 There
 you
 go.
 93


on
 Bitcoin.
 Wow.
 This
 Jolt
 move,
 if
 we


want
 to
 call
 it
 a
 Jolts
 move,
 BMR
 up


five,
 Hoodie
 up
 two,
 Micro
 Strategy
 up


three,
 Coinbase
 up
 four.


I
 don't know
 if
 it's
 a
 Jolts
 move,
 but


maybe
 it's
 a
 Jolts
 move.


um
 you're
 you're
 either
 super
 excited
 to


see
 someone
 worth
 that
 much
 because


they've
 created
 so
 much
 or
 you
 know
 you


hate
 to
 see
 someone
 have
 that
 much


wealth
 but
 it's
 quite
 incredible.


I
 am
 more
 on
 the
 side
 of
 the
 former


rather
 than
 the
 latter.
 I
 mean
 the


number
 is
 mindboggling.
 One
 person
 being


worth
 that
 much.
 But
 also
 it's
 like
 well


if
 you
 built
 companies
 that
 end
 up


getting
 valued
 like
 that
 because
 other


people
 are
 willing
 to
 invest
 and
 they


believe
 in
 that
 valuation
 and
 you
 own
 a


significant
 percentage
 like
 yeah
 your


net
 worth
 goes
 up
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that


and
 you
 know
 he's
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 money


for
 the
 people
 that
 have
 been
 on
 the


ride
 ride
 with
 him.
 Bitcoin
 right
 there.


93.
 Hoodie
 is
 really
 if
 she
 goes
 back
 to


140,
 dude.
 I
 mean,
 that
 would
 be
 quite


impressive.
 This
 thing
 went
 from
 150


down
 to
 100.
 She
 actually
 makes
 her
 run


back
 to
 140
 and
 holds
 it.
 That'd
 be
 very


nice
 to
 see.
 Bit
 mine
 right
 there,


that's
 up
 5.78%.
 Bit
 mine
 hasn't
 been
 at


40
 in
 basically
 a
 month.
 And
 then


Coinbase
 was
 at
 400
 before
 it
 fell.
 Now


it's
 at
 283,


up
 3.2%.


Do
 we,
 you
 know,
 we
 did
 a
 poll
 a
 couple


days
 ago,
 I
 think
 last
 week,
 uh,
 and
 the


majority
 of
 you
 said
 Bitcoin
 will
 hit


100K
 before
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 So,
 I


mean,
 maybe
 Hood
 to
 150,
 maybe
 Micro


Strategy
 back
 to
 200.
 I
 mean,
 that
 stuff


is
 very
 possible


if
 we
 get
 that
 100K.
 Did
 Nvidia
 go


green?
 Wow,
 Nvidia's
 going
 green.
 Dude,


what
 is
 this
 uh
 movement?
 Because
 I


don't
 want
 to
 say
 Jolts
 is
 the
 Joltz
 was


the
 the
 the
 thousand
 Bitcoin
 candle.
 I


mean
 like
 as
 soon
 as
 the
 Jolts
 number


cames
 out,
 the
 candle
 went
 up,
 but
 I


don't
 think
 Jolts
 actually
 matters
 that


much
 for
 crypto.
 So


it
 feels
 like
 whatever
 happened
 at
 that


moment,
 maybe
 the
 crypto
 markets
 are


using
 Jolts
 as
 an
 excuse
 to
 go
 higher.


Looks
 like
 they
 wanted
 to
 rip.


The
 market
 literally
 jolted.
 Guess


it's
 the
 October
 clarity
 from
 Jolts.


That's
 fair.
 And
 October
 jobs
 did
 beat


expectations
 by
 like
 10,000.
 So
 that's


fair.


Maybe
 that
 was
 enough
 to
 get
 the
 risk
 on


market
 more
 excited.
 Hims
 right
 there


just
 below
 40.
 Galaxy
 9%
 on
 the
 day.


Shout
 out
 to
 Devin
 Ryan.
 Hell
 of
 a
 day


to
 initiate
 coverage
 yesterday
 on
 this


bad
 boy.
 Clean
 Spark
 as
 well.
 Massive


move.
 Coreweave
 also
 diluted
 yesterday.


Street
 kind
 of
 moved
 on
 from
 it.
 87


that's
 up
 1%


as
 well
 on
 the
 day.


Sergio,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Thank
 you,
 Mid,
 for
 showing
 up
 today,


especially
 being
 under
 the
 weather.


Sending
 you
 healing
 vibes
 your
 way.


Appreciate
 it,
 Sergio.
 Thank
 you
 for


being
 here.
 I
 really
 did
 not
 want
 to


miss
 two
 days
 in
 a
 row.
 I
 feel
 like
 you


can
 miss
 one
 day,
 but
 missing
 two
 days


is
 unacceptable.
 So,
 yeah,
 I'm
 happy
 uh


we
 were
 able
 to
 still
 be
 here.
 And


again,
 thank
 you
 to
 everyone
 who
 reached


out
 yesterday
 and
 said
 to
 feel
 better.
 I


just
 I
 I
 really
 thought
 when
 I
 went
 to


sleep
 Sunday,
 I'd
 be
 like,
 I'm
 I'll
 be


good
 by
 the
 morning.
 And
 then
 I
 woke
 up


and
 I
 was
 like,
 dude,
 I'm
 not
 good.


Like,
 there's
 just
 no
 way
 I
 can
 go
 live.


So,
 I
 really
 really
 do
 appreciate


everyone
 that
 reached
 out.
 I
 know
 a
 lot


of
 people
 were
 like,
 "Dude,
 what's
 the


market
 can't
 open
 if
 I
 don't
 hear
 the


bell?
 Like,
 what's
 going
 on?
 Like,
 how


am
 I
 supposed
 to?"
 And
 I
 get
 it.
 It's


part
 of
 my
 routine
 as
 well.
 It
 was


weird.
 at
 9:30.
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 my


phone
 and
 I
 was
 just
 like,
 I
 should
 be


ringing
 a
 bell
 right
 now.
 But
 the
 show


must
 go
 on.


The
 show
 must
 go
 on.
 Carvana
 right
 there


at
 453
 still
 up
 1.2.
 Even
 Grab
 going


green.
 Look
 at
 that.
 Even
 Grab
 getting
 a


little
 bit
 of
 green
 today.
 Zeta
 still


moving
 higher.
 And
 then
 Google
 going


green.
 All right.
 Amazon
 going
 green.


Nebas
 close
 to
 100.
 The
 Q's
 just
 went


green.
 S&P's
 green.
 Meta
 still
 down.


Meta
 not
 really
 getting
 a
 bounce,


but
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 other
 names


going
 green.


Can
 we
 see
 a
 doctor's
 note?
 Dude,
 that's


what
 it
 felt
 like.
 It
 felt
 like
 I
 need


to
 like
 submit
 a
 doctor's
 note
 to
 prove


that
 I'm
 like
 actually
 sick.


And
 then
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 didn't
 see


the
 YouTube
 community
 post.
 So,
 it's


just
 like
 all
 these
 messages
 on
 X
 like,


"Hey,
 like
 where
 what's
 going
 on?
 Where


are
 you?


It's
 like
 how
 do
 you
 tell
 everyone


you're
 sick,
 you
 know?


But
 nonetheless,
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.


I
 hope
 I
 don't
 actually
 get
 sick.
 Like


again,
 yesterday
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 of a


cold.
 It's
 like
 it's
 hard
 to
 talk,
 so


it's
 like
 all
 take
 a
 day
 off.
 But
 like


if
 I
 got
 the
 flu
 or
 something,
 which
 I


think
 the
 last
 time
 I
 got
 the
 flu
 was


back
 in


like
 2018.
 It's
 been
 a
 long
 time.
 I


mean,
 I
 had
 COVID
 after
 that,
 but
 like
 I


haven't
 gotten
 sick
 sick
 in
 a
 minute.


And
 when
 that
 happens,
 that's
 like
 a


minimum
 of
 three,
 four
 days
 you'd
 be


out.


So
 hopefully
 we
 can
 say
 okay.


Yeah,
 Neil
 Neil
 did
 message
 me.
 Neil
 did


me
 he
 said
 uh
 what
 did
 he
 say?
 He
 said


the
 the
 emit
 refugees
 ended
 up
 going
 to


his
 stream.


Neil's
 a
 good
 guy.
 We
 we'll
 be
 uh
 we
 me


and
 Neil
 will
 be
 live
 probably
 with
 Jose


tomorrow
 for
 Oracle.


So
 we'll
 be
 uh
 we'll
 be
 streaming
 all
 of


that.


You
 should
 just
 come
 on
 for
 one
 minute


to
 ring
 the
 bell
 when
 sick.
 That,
 you


know,
 that's
 not
 a
 horrible
 idea.
 Or


ring
 it
 for
 that
 one
 minute
 and
 then


keep
 going.
 My
 wife
 hates
 me
 waking
 up


and
 listening
 to
 you
 before
 I
 talk
 to


her.
 Dude,
 there
 was
 a
 couple
 people


that
 messaged
 me
 that.
 One
 guy
 was
 like,


"Dude,
 my
 wife
 was
 like,
 where's
 the


good
 morning
 guy?
 Where
 is
 he?"


That's
 so
 funny.


It's
 a
 thing,
 right?
 When
 you
 have
 a


routine,
 you
 have
 a
 routine.
 It's
 the


same
 thing
 for
 me.
 Like
 when
 I'm
 when
 a


content
 creator
 I
 I
 constantly
 listen
 to


doesn't
 post,
 it's
 like
 messes
 up
 your


routine,
 especially
 if
 it's
 part
 of
 your


day.
 S&P
 684,
 Coinbase
 283,
 Dualingo


even
 moving
 today.
 I'm
 trying
 to
 see
 if


there's
 a
 better
 headline


right
 now
 on
 why
 exactly
 we
 flipped


green.


It
 could
 just
 be
 the
 ALOS
 11
 o'clock


ALOS
 10:30
 slam
 didn't
 happen
 today.
 Is


that
 it?
 Rate
 cut
 probability
 still


high.
 I
 mean,
 maybe
 it's
 Kathy.
 Let's


see
 what
 Kathy
 has
 to
 say.
 Maybe
 she's


getting
 the
 market
 bowled
 up.


>> It's
 risk
 on.
 We
 This
 is
 It
 is
 climbing


another
 wall
 of
 worry.
 Um
 uh
 and
 that
 is


the
 four-year
 cycle.
 Uh
 we
 think
 the


four-year
 cycle
 is
 uh
 is
 going
 to
 be


disrupted.
 And
 what
 what
 I
 mean
 by
 that


is
 Bitcoin
 regularly
 dropped
 75
 to
 90%


in
 its
 early
 days.
 uh
 the
 volatility
 is


going
 down.
 Uh
 it's
 down
 about
 30
 some


odd
 percent
 and
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 fear


uh
 of
 the
 four-year
 cycle.
 Uh
 we
 think


that
 the
 move
 by
 institutions
 into
 this


new
 asset
 class
 is
 going
 to
 prevent
 much


more
 of
 a
 decline.
 We
 may
 have
 seen
 the


low
 a
 couple
 of
 weeks
 ago.
 Uh
 now
 gold


is
 more
 of
 a
 riskoff
 asset
 and
 that
 uh


its
 rise
 we
 think
 is
 is
 uh
 is
 proof
 that


we
 are
 climbing
 a
 wall
 of
 worry.
 uh


investors
 are
 using
 gold
 as
 a
 hedge


against
 geopolitical
 risk.
 And
 uh
 and


yet
 if
 you
 look
 at
 what
 happened
 uh
 from


the
 early
 80s
 to
 the
 late
 90s,
 uh
 gold


went
 down
 as
 we
 were
 in
 the
 really
 the


golden
 age
 for
 we
 for
 uh
 uh
 innovation


ending
 with
 the
 with
 the
 internet.
 We


think
 the
 same
 could
 happen
 now
 and
 that


Bitcoin
 will
 remain
 a
 riskon
 and


re-engage


uh
 and
 uh
 this
 fear
 of
 AI
 hype
 will
 uh
 I


think
 it's
 good
 as
 an
 investor.
 I'm


happy
 that
 people
 are
 worried
 uh
 but
 I


think
 we
 will
 continue
 to
 lean
 into
 that


because
 we've
 really
 just
 begun
 the
 AI


age.


>> And
 you've
 and
 you're
 poised
 to
 increase


holdings
 and
 exposure
 to
 your
 Bitcoin


ETF,
 right?


>> Uh
 yeah.
 Oh,
 well,
 Bitcoin
 ETF
 is
 ARKB


is
 passive.
 So,
 the
 more
 uh
 the
 more


that
 investors
 want
 to
 to
 participate
 in


this
 new
 asset
 class
 through
 ARKB
 and


other
 spot
 Bitcoin
 ETFs.


>> So,
 Kathy
 continues
 to
 be
 bullish


Bycoin.
 I
 mean,
 you've
 got
 a
 lot
 of


93,000
 right
 here.
 You
 got
 a
 lot
 of


inflows
 that
 haven't
 really
 stopped


coming
 in.
 November
 was
 where
 you
 had


more
 outflows
 for
 Bitcoin.
 a
 lot
 more


influence
 for
 gold.
 Uh
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


reversal
 at
 least
 in
 the
 first
 couple


days
 of
 December


as
 Bitcoin


uh
 Bitcoin
 continuing
 to
 make
 a
 move


right
 here


and
 you're
 seeing
 that
 momentum
 right


now.
 Uh
 Vlad
 did
 an
 AMA
 yesterday
 and


someone
 asked
 him,
 our
 boy
 Juan,
 do
 you


plan
 to
 expand
 into
 Latin
 America?
 Vlad


said,
 eventually
 I
 want
 to
 expand


everywhere.
 It's
 just
 a
 matter
 of
 when.


I
 really
 do
 think
 Hood's
 going
 to
 a


trillion.
 I
 know
 I
 sound
 like
 a
 super


crazy
 euphoric
 bull
 when
 I
 say
 that,
 but


I've
 been
 saying
 that
 for
 the
 past


couple
 months
 now.
 Like,
 seems


inevitable.
 It's
 not
 going
 to
 happen


soon.
 It's
 going
 to
 take
 time.
 It's


going
 to
 be
 a
 bumpy
 ride.
 Probably
 a
 bit


expensive
 right
 now
 in
 the
 stock,
 but


these
 guys
 have
 such
 a
 massive


opportunity.


Like,
 it's
 going
 to
 happen.
 And
 there's


so
 many.
 And
 that
 podcast
 on
 the


compound
 just
 made
 me
 even
 more
 bullish


as
 Vlad
 was
 talking
 about
 the
 different


verticals
 that
 they're
 expanding
 to.
 I


mean,
 dude,
 they're
 eventually
 going
 to


get
 into
 like
 all
 these
 different


ancillary
 things
 that
 we
 don't
 even


think
 about.
 Wow,
 Bitcoin
 really


continuing
 to
 pump
 934.


934.


When's
 the
 last
 time
 we
 saw
 94?


Last
 time
 we
 saw
 94.


November
 14th.


And
 that's
 when
 it
 was
 declining
 from


106
 on
 November
 10th.


It's
 been
 a
 month.


It's
 been
 a
 month
 since
 we've
 seen
 it.


Yeah.
 I
 I
 just
 think
 there's
 so
 many


verticals
 for
 them
 to
 expand
 into.
 I


mean,
 they
 haven't
 even
 got
 into
 lending


yet.
 Lending
 is
 a
 many,
 many,
 many


multi-
 trillion
 dollar
 market


that
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 tacking
 headon.


Hood
 right
 there
 13879.


Duolingo's
 up.
 UNH
 still
 doing
 okay.


324,


Oscar
 17,


and
 then
 Lemonade.
 Lemonade's
 had
 a


great
 year.
 Had
 a
 massive
 earnings,


pumped
 like
 40%.
 It's
 held
 on
 to
 its


gains.
 So,
 if
 you're
 in
 Lemonade,


you've
 seen
 a
 lot
 of
 excitement
 on
 that


one
 as
 well.
 7792


December
 3rd.
 Really?
 We
 hit
 94
 on


December
 3rd.


December
 3rd.
 You
 guys
 are
 probably


right.


December
 3rd.
 Okay,
 it
 was
 a
 very
 quick


94.
 We
 hit
 94.1.


Okay,
 so
 outside
 of
 December
 3rd,
 last


time
 we
 hit
 it
 was
 November
 15th.


95,
 I
 guess
 you
 could
 say,
 is
 back
 in


November.
 So,
 a
 run
 to
 95
 would
 be


exciting.
 Apply
 Digital
 breaking
 through


34,
 up
 7%


on
 the
 day.
 Micron's
 been
 getting
 a
 hit


over
 the
 past
 couple
 of
 weeks.


Wait,
 is
 it
 back
 at
 alltime
 highs


already?


Yeah,
 it's
 basically
 right
 260
 is
 the


alltime
 high.
 It's
 at
 255.
 It
 got
 hit


last
 week
 and
 the
 week
 before


um
 fell
 to
 like
 235.
 Look
 at
 that.
 What


a
 recovery
 on
 Micron.
 You
 know
 the
 guy


who's
 bullish
 on
 Micron,
 Josh
 Wolf,
 who


runs
 Lux
 Capital.
 I
 was
 listening
 to
 a


podcast
 and
 uh
 he
 was
 talking
 about
 HBM


and
 memory.


I
 mean,
 they've
 been
 long
 Micron
 for
 a


while,
 but
 they,
 you
 know,
 they
 love


Nvidia,
 they
 love
 the
 semiconductor


trade,
 but
 Micron
 was
 really
 where
 they


thought
 there
 was
 going
 to
 be
 a
 shortage


of
 supply,
 which
 would
 increase
 the


pricing
 power
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 memory


companies.
 And
 boy,
 did
 they
 nail
 that


thesis.
 Micron
 just
 absolutely


crushed
 it.
 By
 the
 way,
 our
 boy
 Chase


Coleman
 from
 Tiger
 Global,
 they're


raising
 another
 $3
 billion
 VC
 fund.
 And


the
 goal
 of
 the
 fund
 as
 per
 the
 memo
 is


to
 double
 down
 on
 their
 AI
 investments.


So
 they're
 not
 trying
 to
 find
 new


companies.
 They're
 trying
 to
 double
 down


on
 like
 the
 current
 AI
 stocks
 they're


already
 investing
 in
 and
 continue
 to,


you
 know,
 prove
 that
 those
 names
 deserve


more
 capital
 as
 those
 companies
 are
 in


massive
 massive
 growth
 phases.
 By
 the


way,
 speaking
 of
 these
 VC
 names,
 uh,
 a


company
 called
 Unconventional
 AI


raised
 $475
 million
 yesterday


in
 a
 seed
 round,
 not
 series
 A,
 not


series
 B,
 seed
 round,
 valuing
 themselves


at
 4.5
 billion.
 Now,
 you
 might
 be
 asking


yourself,
 what
 does
 Unconventional
 AI


do?
 They
 build
 chips.


They
 build
 they're
 they're
 an
 Nvidia


competitor.
 So
 the
 the
 interesting


takeaway
 for
 this
 was
 not
 necessarily
 if


the
 startup
 is
 going
 to
 be
 super


successful
 or
 not.
 I
 mean
 time
 will


tell.
 Uh
 the
 valuation
 obviously
 is


aggressive
 at
 at
 that
 seed
 stage,
 but


obviously
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 building


hardware,
 you're
 going
 to
 need
 to
 raise


a
 lot
 of
 money.
 What's
 more
 interesting


to
 me
 is
 that
 you've
 got
 everyone
 saying


Nvidia
 is
 a
 bubble
 and
 that
 chips
 are
 a


bubble
 and
 they're
 like,
 "Oh,
 this
 is


going
 to
 slow
 down."
 And
 then
 you
 have


literal
 seedfunded
 startups
 that
 are


getting
 a
 $5
 billion
 valuation
 to
 build


competitive
 chips
 because
 a
 the
 market


is
 so
 massive
 that
 they
 feel
 they
 have
 a


shot
 to
 compete
 with
 Nvidia
 in
 terms
 of


selling
 chips.
 B
 they
 think
 they
 can


make
 better
 chips
 than
 Nvidia.
 Now
 will


they?
 Who
 knows?
 But
 even
 if
 they
 kind


of
 make
 chips
 that
 are
 relatively
 as


strong
 as
 Nvidia
 or
 even,
 you
 know,
 20%


as
 strong
 as
 Nvidia,
 there's
 probably


going
 to
 be
 a
 market
 to
 sell
 it
 into


because
 the
 demand
 is
 so
 strong
 for


these
 chips.


Yeah,
 they're
 building
 analog
 chips
 to


challenge
 digital.
 Exactly.
 They
 did
 a


whole
 podcast.
 I'll
 link
 it
 right
 here


with
 A16Z.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 you've
 got
 the


Michael
 Burries
 of
 the
 world
 just


screaming
 about
 Bubble
 and
 how


everything's
 fake.
 Now
 he's
 asking,
 you


know,
 he
 tweeted
 that
 he
 was
 asking
 he


wants
 pictures
 of
 the
 GPUs
 in
 the
 data


centers
 to
 prove
 that
 they're
 actually


there.


I
 think
 the
 guy
 is
 kind
 of
 losing
 it,


bro.
 I
 really
 I
 I
 really
 think
 I
 think


my
 psychoanalytical
 analysis
 of
 why
 Bur


is
 going
 through
 all
 of
 this
 is
 actually


the
 right
 analysis.
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 has


anything
 to
 do
 with
 AI
 bubble.
 I
 think


he
 wants
 to
 be
 the
 guy
 like
 he
 was
 in


2008.
 He
 wants
 to
 feel
 like
 he
 did


17
 years
 ago.
 S&P
 high
 of
 day
 at
 685
 and


I
 think
 he's
 kind
 of
 crashing
 out
 at


this
 point.


I
 listened
 to
 the
 interview
 with
 Michael


Lewis.
 I
 listened
 to
 it.
 I
 don't
 think


he
 said
 anything
 interesting.
 Did
 any


did
 anyone
 in
 that
 podcast
 hear
 anything


interesting
 that
 he
 said?
 It's
 the
 same


arguments
 that
 he's
 been
 making
 on
 his


Twitter
 about
 why
 he
 thinks
 AI
 is
 fake.


And
 look,
 eventually
 will
 there
 be
 some


bust
 to
 all
 of
 this
 spending?
 Like,


yeah,
 probably.


Will
 it
 happen
 in
 the
 next
 two?
 Like


like
 if
 it
 happens
 in
 2033,
 does
 Bur
 get


to
 be
 right?


Like
 no.
 Like
 I
 think
 you
 have
 like
 a


two-year
 time
 frame,
 right?
 He
 initiated


the
 short
 in
 2005.
 By
 2007
 the
 housing


market
 crashed.
 Okay,
 he
 gets
 the
 credit


for
 it.
 If
 we
 don't
 crash
 by
 2028,


like
 does
 this
 guy
 deserve
 the
 credit


for
 I
 mean
 like
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think
 at


some
 point
 we'll
 probably
 get
 an
 acid


bubble.
 Rates
 probably
 get
 too
 low.
 Like


you
 probably
 start
 to
 see
 things
 get


euphoric
 and
 overvalued.
 And
 hopefully


unlike
 2021,
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 will
 be
 able
 to


see
 that
 happening.
 Although
 it's
 going


to
 be
 really
 hard.


But
 the
 point
 is
 like
 if
 it
 doesn't


happen
 in
 the
 next
 year
 or
 two,


then
 I
 don't
 know if
 he
 deserves
 to
 to


get
 the
 credit
 on
 that.
 Nvidia
 still


trying
 to
 push
 to
 go
 green.
 And
 then


Hoodie
 really
 pushing
 for
 140.


Really
 pushing


for
 140
 right
 here.


13967


on
 hoodie.
 Iran
 as
 well
 up
 5%
 on
 the


day.


I
 also
 think
 all
 these
 neo
 clouds
 that


are
 buying
 these
 GPUs,
 acquiring
 all


this
 land
 to
 build
 all
 these
 data


centers.
 Again,
 is
 all
 of
 that
 fake?
 You


could
 hate
 the
 business
 model
 of
 the


Neoclouds.
 That's
 totally
 fine.
 You


could
 say
 that
 the
 business
 model


results
 in
 too
 much
 debt
 and
 dilution,


not
 enough
 ROI
 on
 the
 capex.
 That
 that's


totally
 fine.


But
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 can
 necessarily


say
 it's
 all
 fake.


It's
 just
 hard
 to
 make
 that
 argument.


BMR.


Wow.
 30
 almost
 39.


Last
 time
 we
 saw
 this
 was
 legitimately


November
 12th.


And
 then
 last
 time
 we
 saw
 40
 was


November
 10th.


So
 it's
 been
 a
 minute
 even
 getting
 close


to
 that
 $40
 level
 for
 BMR.
 Circle
 up
 on


the
 day
 as
 well.
 This
 crypto
 getting


some
 love.
 Circle
 88.880
 on
 the
 day.


Small
 caps
 also
 getting
 all-time
 highs.


Wow,


what
 a
 Tuesday.
 If
 the
 S&P
 can
 catch
 up,


we're
 going to
 see
 alltime
 highs
 across


the
 entire
 market.
 ETH
 above
 3,300.
 Look


at
 that.


Well,


very
 close
 to
 3,300.
 Did
 we
 touch
 it?


Yeah,
 we
 touched
 it
 for
 a
 sec.
 We


touched
 3302.


Yeah,
 old
 is
 green
 and
 Nvidia
 is
 still


red.


just
 goes
 to
 show
 how
 afraid
 the
 market


still
 is
 of
 this
 whole
 bubble


conversation.


Now,
 this
 could
 be
 setting
 us
 up
 for
 a


ugly


ugly
 uh


rugpole
 tomorrow


if
 you
 know
 you
 know
 every
 time
 uh


what's
 his
 name?
 Pal
 announces


everything
 by
 3:30
 we
 see
 the
 real
 price


action.
 So
 3:30
 to
 4
 is
 when
 the
 price


action
 takes
 place


and
 that's
 when
 we
 get
 to
 know
 what


happens.
 The
 meeting
 usually
 ends
 by


around
 3:30.


So,
 could
 it
 be
 setting
 us
 up
 for
 a


rugpull?
 Maybe.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 pro.
 Look,


the
 the
 the
 the
 mainstream
 reaction
 that


I've
 heard
 from
 the
 talking
 heads
 is


that
 it
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 hawkish
 cut,


which
 I
 don't
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 be


wrong
 about.
 Like,
 it's
 probably
 going


to
 be
 a
 cut
 with
 a
 mix
 of,
 hey,
 like


don't
 expect
 us
 to
 cut
 anytime
 soon


because
 we're
 measuring
 inflation,


labor,
 basically
 the
 same
 thing
 he
 did


last
 time.
 But
 even
 with
 that,
 given
 the


seasonal
 aspect
 of
 where
 we're
 going


into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year,
 along
 with
 the


fact
 that
 the
 market's
 been
 begging
 for


this
 cut,


I
 still
 think
 there's
 a
 world
 where
 we


can
 get
 potentially
 that
 start
 to
 a


Santa
 Claus
 rally.
 Speaking
 of
 that


Santa
 rally,
 take
 a
 look
 at
 this.
 When


the
 Fed
 cuts
 interest
 rates
 within
 2%
 of


the
 stock
 market
 all-time
 highs,
 which


is
 where
 we
 are
 right
 now,
 the
 S&P
 500


has
 gone
 on
 to
 finish
 higher
 over
 the


next
 12
 months
 20
 out
 of
 20
 times
 for
 an


average
 gain
 of
 14%.


So
 on
 average,
 if
 we're
 within
 2%
 of
 the


all-time
 high
 and
 the
 Fed
 ends
 up


cutting,
 the
 S&P
 is
 up
 14%
 the
 next


year,
 which
 would
 put
 us


basically
 around
 that
 787,900
 range.


I
 mean,
 maybe


maybe
 that's
 where
 we
 end
 up
 going
 into


2026.


Yeah,
 maybe
 Santa's
 actually
 coming
 to


town.
 It
 would
 be
 fun,
 right?
 like


before
 Thanksgiving,
 we
 got
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 pump.
 Made
 Thanksgiving
 a
 little


bit
 more
 fun.
 You
 know,
 we
 got
 a
 few


more
 weeks
 till
 Christmas,
 but


maybe
 we
 get
 that
 pump
 coming
 in.
 But
 we


got
 to
 hold
 this
 though.
 We
 got
 to


really
 hold
 this.
 This
 is
 the
 first
 time


in
 a
 while
 we've
 seen
 like
 everything,


including
 silver
 and
 gold
 part
 of
 that


everything
 rally
 thesis.
 Wow.
 Silver


60.27.


That's
 up
 4%.
 It
 hits
 6040


and
 then
 gold
 still
 moving.
 Micro


strategy
 up
 5%
 as
 well.


Why
 does
 BMR
 keep
 dropping
 randomly
 by


$2?
 Remember
 Tom
 Le
 is
 probably
 issuing


shares
 when
 you
 get
 a
 mean
 breakout,


which
 is
 the
 whole
 function
 of
 the


business
 model,
 right?
 So,
 it's
 hard
 for


it
 to
 really
 break
 out
 unless
 Ethereum


breaks
 out.
 But
 if
 you
 get
 a
 slight


breakout,
 that's
 where
 you
 get
 the


decrease
 because
 that's
 when
 they
 dilute


to
 raise
 money
 to
 then
 buy


buy
 ETH.


So
 to
 see
 a
 monster
 monster
 breakout,


you
 know,
 that
 just
 takes
 a
 lot
 more
 uh


ETH
 momentum.


Why
 did
 Meta
 dump?
 I
 think
 it's
 that
 goo


Google
 Glasses
 headline
 competing
 with


Meta,
 but
 the
 more
 I
 think
 about
 it,
 the


more
 I'm
 like,
 that's
 a
 really
 stupid


reason
 for
 it
 to
 dump.
 655
 right
 here.


I
 don't
 know.
 The
 glasses
 shouldn't
 be


the
 thing.
 Maybe
 their
 avocado
 model
 the


street's
 upset
 about,
 but
 the
 street


should
 want
 them
 to
 be
 spending
 capex
 on


something
 they
 can
 get
 a
 return
 on.


Having
 a
 model
 to
 compete
 with
 GPT
 and


Gemini
 seems
 like
 at least
 some
 reason


to
 spend
 on
 capex.
 So


yeah,
 Meta
 just
 could
 be
 a
 gap
 fill
 as


well.
 That
 that's
 very
 fair.


That
 could
 also
 be
 happening.


Applied
 Digital
 up
 9%.
 That's
 correct.


Clean
 Spark
 making
 its
 move.


Um,


a
 lot
 of
 these
 data
 center
 plays
 getting


some
 love.


I
 have
 not
 heard
 about
 the
 Rocket
 Lab


HalfLife
 3
 conspiracy
 that
 is
 going
 on


in
 the
 internet.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 super


chat,
 but
 I've
 not
 heard
 about
 any


conspiracy
 that
 has
 to
 do
 with
 that
 and


Rocket
 Lab.


I'll
 look
 into
 it
 today,
 but


have
 not
 heard
 about
 it.
 Trump
 issues


executive
 order
 on
 food
 supply
 chain
 now


published
 in
 the
 Federal
 Register.
 You


do
 have
 uh
 Trump
 saying
 that
 he
 wants
 to


pay
 the
 farmers


uh
 through
 an
 executive
 order
 with
 about


12
 billion


given
 that
 the
 farmers
 have
 been
 gutted


over
 the
 past
 couple
 months
 because
 of


the
 tariffs
 unfortunately.


So


also
 be
 something


that
 we're
 gonna
 see.


Avocado
 means
 dip.
 Yeah,
 maybe
 that's


why.
 Uh
 we
 got
 Jack
 Mer
 is
 live.
 Let's


see
 what
 he
 has
 to
 say
 around
 Caner


Equity
 Partners
 and
 the
 overall
 crypto


trading


>> opportunities
 in
 brokerage,
 exchange,


credit,
 and
 lending.
 I
 mean,
 to
 us,
 the


opportunities
 are
 endless.
 Again,
 this


is
 something
 we've
 been
 doing
 for
 over
 a


decade
 is
 producing
 highv
 value


products,
 high
 margin,
 high
 growth
 cash


flow
 and
 the
 ability
 to
 pair
 it
 with
 a


large
 treasury
 in
 the
 capital
 markets.


We
 want
 to
 give
 the
 capital
 markets
 both


blue
 chip
 credibility
 and
 startup
 upside


and
 ability
 to
 contribute
 and


participate
 in
 Bitcoin
 story.
 We
 think


that
 the
 markets
 are
 going
 to
 really


really
 love
 that.


>> So,
 you
 want
 to
 do
 brokerage
 like


Coinbase,
 but
 strictly
 Bitcoin?


>> Yeah,
 listen,
 these
 things
 we'll
 we'll


come
 out
 with
 them
 sooner
 rather
 than


later.
 Uh
 I'm
 not
 committing
 to
 any


timelines
 today,
 but
 uh
 we're
 really


interested
 in
 building
 credit
 markets
 on


top
 of
 Bitcoin,
 lending
 products
 on
 top


of
 Bitcoin.
 It's
 a
 it's
 a
 two
 trillion


dollar
 asset
 that
 needs
 credit
 and


lending
 and
 capital
 behind
 it.
 There's


nobody
 better
 than
 partners
 like
 Tether


and
 Soft
 Bank.
 And
 then
 our
 experience


in
 the
 brokerage
 and
 trading
 space,
 we


think
 that
 there's
 evergreen


opportunity.
 And
 really
 the
 thing
 is,


you
 know,
 our
 tagline
 is
 a
 Bitcoin


company.
 We're
 not
 a
 stable
 coin


company.
 We're
 not
 a
 crypto
 company.


We're
 not
 a
 prediction
 market
 company.


We
 see
 Bitcoin
 as
 the
 forest
 through
 the


trees.
 It
 is
 the
 opportunity
 and
 no
 one


seemingly
 focused
 on
 it.
 And
 that's
 the


part
 that
 the
 story
 of
 this
 equity
 is
 to


focus
 solely
 on
 Bitcoin.
 Deliver
 value


to
 shareholders
 through
 primarily


Bitcoin.


>> Who
 should
 buy
 your
 stock?
 Why
 wouldn't


they
 just
 buy
 Bitcoin
 then?


>> Well,
 because
 they
 don't
 have
 Tether


Soft
 Bank
 and
 the
 cash
 flows
 that
 we'll


produce.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 agree
 with


that.
 We
 do
 not
 want
 the
 market
 to
 think


of
 us
 and
 price
 us
 as
 just
 a
 treasury


asset.
 That
 is
 not
 us
 at
 all.
 We're


going
 to
 acquire
 as
 much
 Bitcoin
 as
 we


possibly
 can.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 it's
 crazy


that
 we
 own
 over
 four
 times
 the
 amount


of
 Bitcoin
 Coinbase
 does.
 And
 this
 is
 my


first
 day
 in
 the
 in
 the
 public
 markets.


But,
 you
 know,
 we
 also
 want
 to
 build


massive
 businesses
 and
 and
 I
 do
 agree


with
 that.
 For
 as
 bullish
 as
 Coinbase
 is


on
 Bitcoin,
 for
 them
 to
 not
 own
 it
 or


own
 a
 significant
 amount
 of
 it
 on
 their


balance
 sheet
 is
 a
 bit
 weird.
 And
 I
 get


they're
 an
 exchange
 and
 all,
 but
 they're


strictly
 a
 crypto
 exchange.
 You
 would


think
 they
 they
 would
 have
 been
 putting


it
 on
 their
 balance
 sheet
 for
 like
 the


past
 decade
 and
 they
 they
 really
 don't


have
 a
 sizable
 position
 in
 Bitcoin
 even


though
 they're
 a
 crypto
 company.


>> I
 think
 the
 markets
 will
 appreciate.
 You


know,
 Tether's
 Tether's
 no
 slouch
 to


that.


>> Has
 the
 recent
 volatility
 been
 jarring


to
 you
 or
 is
 this
 like
 just
 par
 for
 the


much
 worse?


>> Par
 for
 the
 course.
 Come
 on,
 man.
 Yeah,


of
 course.
 I
 mean
 listen
 to
 own
 the
 best


performer
 in
 the
 face
 of
 currency


debasement
 in
 this
 new
 you
 know
 fiat
 era


regime
 of
 infinite
 amounts
 of
 deficits


and
 printing
 you
 know
 bitcoin
 is
 priced


on
 the
 future
 expectation
 of
 fiat


currency
 and
 it's
 a
 wild
 world
 that


we're
 living
 through
 and
 having
 to
 go


through
 and
 so
 you
 eat
 some
 of
 the


volatility
 to
 be
 the
 best
 performer
 you


know
 if
 you
 can't
 take
 the
 heat
 stay
 out


of
 the
 kitchen
 and
 so
 you
 know
 Bitcoin's


a
 winner
 and
 I
 have
 no
 problem
 riding


this
 ride
 and
 neither
 the
 leadership


team
 the
 board
 we
 we've
 we've
 been
 here


>> right
 What
 do
 you
 make
 of
 like
 long-term


uh
 sort
 of
 game
 theory
 ideas
 like


productivity
 through
 AI
 allows
 you
 to


handle
 your
 your
 debt
 or
 quantum
 comes


along
 one
 day
 and
 knocks
 out
 a
 whole


trunch
 of
 Bitcoin
 encryption?
 Things


like
 that.


>> Sure.
 Well,
 oh
 well,
 you
 know,
 quantum


as
 a
 threat
 to
 Bitcoin,
 uh
 that
 that's


not
 a
 real
 threat
 in
 our
 in
 our
 opinion.


Listen,
 the
 coolest
 part
 about
 Bitcoin,


>> uh
 December
 CPI
 coming
 out
 January
 13th.


Wow.
 The
 BLS
 delayed
 CPI
 till
 January.


That's
 a
 month
 after
 the
 FOMC
 meeting.


I
 wonder
 if
 they
 delayed
 the
 November


jobs
 report
 now
 as
 well.
 That's
 supposed


to
 be
 coming
 out
 December
 16th.


Hopefully
 that's
 not
 delayed.
 But
 CPI


for
 December
 will
 be
 out
 later.


>> It's
 not
 a
 rock
 that
 we
 found
 in
 the


ground
 like
 gold.
 It's
 software.
 We
 can


change
 it.
 We
 can
 make
 it
 better.
 The


coolest
 part
 is
 we're
 going
 to
 make


Bitcoin
 better
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 our


lives.
 Bitcoin
 is
 going
 to
 be
 getting


better
 long
 before
 I'm
 gone
 or
 long


after
 I'm
 gone,
 excuse
 me.
 And
 so
 we


Bitcoin
 can
 can
 get
 updated
 and
 and
 it


has
 throughout
 its
 life.
 Quantum
 is
 not


a
 near-term
 threat
 and
 it's
 something


that
 the
 community
 and
 the
 engineers
 can


address.
 It's
 not
 a
 problem
 whatsoever.


And
 the
 other
 point
 on
 on
 deflation,


listen,
 AI
 is
 so
 empowering,
 brings
 so


much
 efficiencies,
 such
 deflationary


impact
 to
 the
 market.
 And
 you
 know
 in


fiat
 is
 a
 very
 inflationary
 system.
 It


needs
 more
 money
 printing.
 It
 needs
 more


debt
 to
 survive.
 So
 AI
 is
 very


disruptive
 to
 a
 world
 that's
 built
 on


debt
 and
 future
 fiat
 printing
 to
 a


deflationary
 asset
 that
 no
 one
 can


print.
 AI
 is
 beautiful.
 It's
 incredible.


And
 I
 I
 think
 Bitcoin
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the


winner
 of
 this
 AI
 era.


>> I
 have
 heard
 more
 people
 talking
 about


whether
 quantum
 can
 break
 the
 blockchain


and
 how
 developers
 in
 Bitcoin
 have
 to


get
 ahead
 of
 that.
 But
 I
 here's
 my


question.
 How
 long
 have
 you
 been
 in
 the


market?
 How
 did
 you
 how
 did
 you
 get


started
 in
 this?


>> Um
 my
 dad
 is
 standing
 somewhere
 over


here.
 Uh
 I
 dropped
 out
 of
 college
 13


years
 ago.
 Um,
 and
 I
 got
 in
 with
 my
 dad.


Um,
 but
 I've
 been
 in
 Bitcoin
 13
 years.


I'm
 the
 founder
 and
 CEO
 of
 Strike
 and


now
 co-founder
 and
 CEO
 uh
 21.
 And
 uh,


Bitcoin's
 all
 I've
 known
 since
 I'm
 31.


So,
 I've
 been
 Bitcoin
 since
 I
 was
 a


legal
 adult,
 18.


>> Yeah,
 not
 bad.
 I
 mean,
 Bitcoin
 doesn't


have
 a
 much
 longer
 life
 than
 that.


>> No,
 but
 how
 what
 about
 Tether?
 When
 did


that
 combination
 come
 in?


>> Well,
 I
 like
 I
 said
 earlier,
 there
 not


too
 many
 people
 at
 the
 Bitcoin
 meetup


sharing
 pizza
 and
 a
 keg
 13
 years
 ago.


And
 so
 Tether
 has
 been
 immensely


innovative
 and
 a
 crucial
 part
 of


Bitcoin's
 story.
 And
 so
 we've
 known
 each


other
 for
 a
 very
 long
 time.
 I
 mean


things
 like
 making
 Bitcoin
 payments


faster
 and
 cheaper,
 the
 El
 Salvador


story,
 I
 was
 a
 major
 piece
 of
 that
 and


Tether
 now
 as
 well.
 So
 it's,
 you
 know,


we're
 friendly.
 We
 share
 a
 very
 similar


worldview.
 We
 think
 of
 this
 technology


as
 the
 most
 empowering
 tool
 that
 we
 have


access
 to
 to
 make
 humanity
 more


prosperous
 and
 push
 for
 a
 vision
 that
 we


fundamentally
 believe
 in.
 And
 so


inevitably,
 we
 were
 going
 to
 co-ound


something
 and
 this
 opportunity
 deeply


inspired
 us.
 We
 think
 we
 can
 bring


something
 unique
 and
 different
 to
 the


capital
 markets.


>> All
 right,
 that's
 what
 we
 got
 from
 Mr.


Jack
 Mers.
 Um,


Bitcoin
 still
 holding
 on.
 I
 think
 that


is
 it
 for
 today.
 We'll
 be
 back
 on
 the


close.
 Ethereum

Bitcoin,
 if
 we
 can
 make
 that
 move
 into

 that'd
 be
 very
 bullish.

seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 either
 begin


to
 get
 excited
 for
 the
 FOMC
 meeting


tomorrow


uh
 which
 will
 be
 followed
 with
 Oracle


and
 Doby
 so
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 massive


earnings


or
 the
 Jolt
 data
 was
 good
 enough
 to
 get


them
 excited
 and
 that's
 we're
 seeing


some
 of
 this
 green
 momentum


right


not
 too
 bad
 not
 too
 bad
 I'll
 be
 back
 on


the
 market
 close
 I'll
 be
 here
 with
 Jason


we
 will
 get
 into
 technical
 Tuesday
 we


don't
 have
 any
 Um,


we
 don't
 have
 any
 earnings
 today.
 I


mean,
 we
 have
 GameStop,
 so
 we'll
 see
 the


results,
 but
 outside
 of
 that,
 we'll
 get


into
 the
 technicals
 and
 see
 what
 we've


got
 going
 on
 from
 there.
 Word
 of
 the


day.
 This
 one's
 an
 easier
 word,
 uh,
 a


bit
 more
 basic,
 but
 always
 good
 to


review
 the
 basics.
 Theta,
 the
 rate
 at


which
 an
 option
 loses
 value
 as
 time


passes.
 The
 silent
 tax
 of
 the
 options


market.
 Selling
 covered
 calls
 prints


steady
 theta
 while
 everyone
 else
 bleeds


it.
 So
 again,
 if
 you
 are
 selling
 an


option,
 theta
 is
 your
 friend.
 You
 want


an
 option
 to
 continue
 losing
 value


because
 then
 it
 goes
 in
 your
 favor.
 If


you're
 buying
 options,
 theta
 is
 not


necessarily
 your
 enemy,
 but
 it's


something
 that's
 working
 against
 you
 and


you
 need
 to
 have
 time
 on
 your
 side
 in


order
 to
 reach
 the
 strike
 price
 that's


needed
 for
 the
 option
 to
 actually


meaningfully
 print.


That
 is
 our
 word
 of
 the
 day.


All right,
 that's
 it,
 folks.
 I'll
 be


back
 um
 on
 the
 close
 again.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 We'll
 have
 a


lot
 of
 updates
 this
 Friday.
 Uh
 we'll


have
 a
 new
 stream
 with
 the
 person
 who
 is


uh
 going
 to
 be
 more
 part
 of
 AK
 Media
 and


it'll
 be
 fun
 to
 introduce
 her
 to
 all
 of


you
 guys.
 We'll
 have
 updates
 on
 the


meetups
 and
 we'll
 have
 technical
 Tuesday


today.


We'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.
 Again,


sorry
 I
 missed
 yesterday.
 I
 missed
 it


just
 as
 much
 as
 or
 I
 hated
 it
 just
 as


much
 as
 you
 guys
 hated
 it.
 And
 we
 could


definitely
 not
 do
 two
 days
 in
 a
 row


because
 then
 I'd
 be
 going
 crazy
 as
 well.


But
 I'm
 excited
 we
 came
 back
 today
 and


we're
 gonna
 keep
 it
 going.
 And
 yeah,
 I


really
 really
 do
 appreciate
 everyone
 who


reached
 out
 just
 to
 know
 if
 I
 was
 alive


or
 not.
 Um
 yeah,
 it
 meant
 a
 lot.
 And


again,
 sometimes
 you
 just
 got
 to
 you
 got


to
 know
 when
 when
 to
 not,
 you
 know,
 put


out
 your
 product
 if
 your
 product
 is
 just


not
 that
 good.


yesterday.
 It
 was
 just,
 forget
 the


sniffling,
 it
 was
 just
 sneezing
 and


cough.
 It
 was
 just
 like
 it
 would
 have


been
 unlistenable.
 So
 happy
 that
 we're


back
 and
 I
 think
 we'll
 get
 better
 over


the
 uh


over
 the
 coming
 days.
 And
 again,
 the


reason
 we
 did
 the
 rapper
 stream
 is


because
 that
 was
 scheduled
 for
 a
 month.


So,
 I
 really
 didn't
 want
 to
 cancel
 that.


I
 just
 slept
 the
 whole
 day
 and
 then
 we


got
 through
 that
 stream,
 which
 I
 think


it
 was
 fun
 for
 those
 that
 were
 there.
 I


think
 I
 think
 people
 enjoyed
 it.
 It
 was


two
 hours.
 Um,
 he
 was
 a
 natural.
 I
 mean


like
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 was
 able
 to
 talk


for
 two
 hours
 and
 there
 were
 there
 was


never
 a
 moment
 where
 like
 I
 asked
 a


question
 and
 it
 got
 awkward
 because
 he


didn't
 have
 an
 answer
 or
 there
 was
 no


one
 had
 anything
 to
 say
 like
 he
 was
 it


was
 a
 very
 natural
 flowing
 conver
 like


he's
 really
 good
 at
 just
 being
 able
 to


talk
 especially
 about
 business
 markets


like
 stuff
 that's
 not
 necessarily
 his


niche
 because
 his
 niche
 is
 more
 music
 so


I
 thought
 it
 was
 a
 great
 time
 and
 you


know
 hopefully
 we'll
 have
 more
 different


collaborations
 I
 know
 it
 surprised
 I


think
 there's
 like
 four
 people
 that
 knew


this
 was
 happening
 most
 people
 did
 not


that
 uh
 we
 were
 doing
 the
 stream,


but
 I
 I
 think
 we'll
 have
 even
 more
 fun


collaborations
 going
 into


going
 into
 2026.


All
 right.
 Thank
 Oh,
 he's
 Yeah,
 Dan


Niles
 is
 his
 grand
 uh
 or
 his
 um


godfather,
 which
 is
 crazy.
 Like
 that's


actual
 like
 that
 when
 he
 told
 me
 that
 I


was
 like,
 dude,
 that's
 so
 wild.
 small


world,
 but
 yeah,
 Dan
 Niles
 is
 his
 uh
 his


godfather.


All right,
 that's
 it.
 Thank
 everybody.


Appreciate
 it.
 Have
 a
 great
 day.
 I'll


see
 you
 guys
 back
 on
 the
 close.
 We'll
 be


with
 Jason
 for
 Technical
 Tuesday.
 And


then
 tomorrow's
 the
 big
 one.
 Tomorrow
 is


the
 big
 one.
 FOMC,
 we
 got
 to
 see
 if
 we


can
 make
 it
 happen.
 Wow,
 ETH,
 she
 is


really
 making
 a
 move
 for
 it.
 I
 know
 a


lot
 of
 us,
 including
 myself,
 felt
 it
 was


fake
 as
 soon
 as
 we
 saw
 the
 initial
 move.


It
 doesn't
 feel
 that
 fake
 anymore.


You'd
 need
 about
 200
 points
 going
 to
 the


downside
 for
 it
 to
 be
 fake,
 which
 could


happen
 because
 it's
 crypto.
 Even
 Bitcoin


300
 points
 away
 from
 94.


Yeah,
 maybe
 it's
 the
 Fusaka
 upgrade.
 But


in
 general,
 you're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 these


risk
 on
 assets
 make
 a
 move.


So
 hopefully
 it
 continues.
 If
 it
 does,


BMR
 gets
 to
 hold
 on
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 these


crypto
 derivative
 plays
 gets
 to
 hold
 on


as
 well.


All
 right,
 thank
 everybody
 for
 being


here.
 and
 we'll
 see
 you
 guys
 on
 the


market
 close.
 Bye
 everybody.
 Have
 a
 good


one.
