I'll
 say
 one
 thing
 about
 VIP
 coding.


It's
 really
 easy
 to
 go
 from
 zero
 to
 one.


I
 think
 we've
 all
 seen
 the
 demos
 of
 I


prom
 thing
 and
 it's
 cool.
 I
 think
 what's


harder
 is
 to
 iterate
 on
 a
 project
 at


scale
 and
 to
 deploy
 changes
 safely.


Every
 marketer
 ever
 sells
 to
 change
 this


page
 at
 some
 point
 and
 the
 old
 way
 was


one
 of
 two
 ways.
 One
 is
 what
 I
 called


you
 had
 to
 petition
 to
 the
 government.


You
 had
 to
 go
 to
 engineers
 and
 say,


"Engineers,
 can
 you
 please
 add
 a
 logo


over
 here
 or
 whatnot
 or
 pray
 that
 the


CMS
 was
 perfectly
 wired
 up
 for
 any


ambition
 or
 dream
 or
 idea
 you
 had.
 So


now
 they
 can
 just
 open
 this
 page
 in
 VZ


and
 prompt
 anything
 that
 they
 want.


>> It
 reduces
 the
 friction
 of
 getting


something
 live
 really,
 really
 low.
 the


humiliation
 ritual
 of
 prioritization


goes
 away
 and
 you
 can
 actually
 focus


your
 time
 on
 defending
 the
 merits
 of
 an


idea
 on
 the
 actual
 idea
 as
 opposed
 to


the
 hypothesis
 of
 the
 idea
 that
 then
 has


to
 be
 implemented.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 it


changes
 the
 speed
 of
 companies
 in
 a


really
 significant
 way.


So
 this
 is
 truly
 a
 first
 time
 vibe


podcast
 that
 we're
 doing
 together
 and
 I


wanted
 to
 introduce
 myself.
 I'm
 Claire


Vo.
 of
 a
 product
 leader
 and
 obsessed


with
 AI
 and
 I
 have
 a
 podcast,
 How
 I
 AI,


where
 I
 teach
 people
 how
 to
 build
 better


with
 all
 these
 new
 tools,
 including
 ones


that
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 today.
 And
 I'm


really
 excited
 to
 have
 you
 here,
 G.


First,
 we're
 just
 going
 to
 get
 to
 the


the
 thing
 that
 everybody's
 wondering


about.
 What
 is
 your
 most
 favorite


feature
 that
 you
 released
 this
 week
 on


VZero?


>> Well,
 I'll
 tell
 you
 the
 hottest
 thing
 in


AI
 today
 is
 skills.
 Everyone
 is
 excited


about
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 can
 now
 augment


agents
 and
 AI
 applications
 and
 agentic


engineering
 with
 skills
 like
 skills
 that


the
 model
 doesn't
 yet
 have.
 And
 so
 we


launched
 skills.sh


and
 the
 beautiful
 thing
 about
 what
 we'll


show
 you
 today
 is
 that
 Vzero
 can


seriously
 go
 from
 prototype
 all
 the
 way


to
 production.
 So
 we're
 able
 to
 conceive


changes
 to
 things
 like
 skills.sh.
 I'm


going to
 show
 you
 really
 quickly.


Skills.sh
 SH
 is
 a
 new
 you
 can
 think
 of


it
 as
 like
 npm.
 It's
 a
 hub
 an
 open


ecosystem
 of
 skills
 and
 it's
 pretty


dramatic
 what's
 happening
 to
 this
 site.


So
 you
 can
 see
 that
 we
 now
 have
 34,000


skills
 submitted
 by
 the
 community
 and


this
 website
 has
 gone
 viral
 all
 over
 the


internet.
 It's
 hosted
 on
 Verscell
 but


the
 most
 exciting
 part
 to
 me
 is
 that
 it


was
 conceived
 in
 Bzero.


>> I
 have
 a
 quick
 question
 for
 the


audience.
 How
 many
 of
 you
 have
 installed


a
 skill
 in
 the
 last
 week?


>> Oh
 wow.


>> Okay.
 A
 lot
 of
 people


>> skill
 build.


>> Um,
 how
 many
 of
 you
 have
 the
 top
 three


installed?


>> Actually,
 top


>> it's
 very
 heavy
 at
 the
 top.
 Right.
 It's


like


>> these
 are
 ripping.


>> Oh,
 no.
 I
 have
 top
 seven.
 Okay.
 Yeah,
 I


have
 the
 top
 seven
 installed
 right
 now.


Um,
 this
 is
 a
 really
 great
 resource.
 So,


for
 folks
 that
 are
 maybe
 watching
 this


later
 or
 haven't
 been
 familiar
 with


skills,
 skills
 is
 now
 this
 standard
 that


a
 lot of
 these
 agentic
 frameworks
 are


using.
 to
 help
 you
 repurpose
 and
 reuse


best
 practices,
 step-by-step
 flows.
 And


so,
 for
 example,
 I
 use
 this
 Remotion


best
 practices
 one
 um
 to
 let
 me
 import


components
 and
 regularly
 create
 videos


really,
 really
 quickly.
 And
 I
 would
 not


have
 been
 able
 to
 do
 this
 without
 the


expertise
 that's
 been
 packaged
 in
 these


best
 practices
 that
 were
 installed
 with


one
 line
 um
 using
 skills.sh.
 I
 think


it's
 also
 worth
 noting
 maybe
 to
 peel
 the


covers
 of
 how
 Versel
 builds
 products.


>> Yep.


>> Skills
 out
 a
 stage
 was
 a
 thing
 that
 was


just
 conceived
 at
 the
 moment
 of


inspiration.
 We
 started
 prompting,
 hey,


wouldn't
 it
 be
 cool


>> if
 this
 thing
 took
 shape?


>> Would
 we
 discussed
 for
 example
 what
 it


should
 look
 like?
 We
 we've
 been
 calling


this
 style
 terminal
 core
 because
 it


looks
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 this
 is
 my


contribution
 to
 the
 project.
 I
 was
 like,


hey,
 wouldn't
 it
 be
 cool
 if
 we
 make
 the


top
 of
 the
 website
 look
 like
 a
 terminal?


And
 so
 the
 the
 the
 process
 itself
 of


building
 this
 was
 very
 much
 prompt


driven
 I'll
 say
 like
 chatting
 in
 Slack


and
 saying
 hey
 wouldn't
 it
 be
 nice
 if
 we


had
 a
 hub
 for
 this
 just
 very
 iterative


very
 collaborative
 between
 the
 team


members
 at
 Verscell
 and
 what's
 really


cool
 about
 this
 again
 is
 it's
 really


fast
 so
 it
 takes
 advantage
 of
 all
 the


versel
 infrastructure
 primitives
 even


though
 it
 has
 35,000
 of
 the
 skills
 like


if
 I
 start
 like
 like
 hardcore
 scrolling


this
 and
 then
 pick
 a
 random
 one.
 All


right,
 Swift
 Taylor
 Swift.
 You're
 going


to
 see
 like
 the
 page
 transitions
 are
 are


swift
 to UI.
 Okay,
 but
 uh
 like
 all
 the


page
 transitions
 are
 instant
 production


grade.
 He
 needed
 to
 scale.
 There
 were


going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 eyes
 on
 this
 thing.


>> Okay.
 So,
 I
 think
 we
 want
 to
 get
 to
 our


first
 workflow
 for
 how
 AI
 and
 you
 just


want
 to
 show
 us
 how
 you
 either
 develop


this
 or
 how
 you
 and
 the
 team
 improve


this
 over
 time
 using
 the
 tool.


>> I'll
 say
 one
 thing
 about
 VIP
 coding.


It's
 really
 easy
 to
 go
 from
 zero
 to
 one.


Like
 I
 think
 we've
 all
 seen
 the
 demos
 of


I
 prom
 thing
 and
 it's
 cool
 and
 I
 think


what's
 harder
 is
 to
 iterate
 on
 a
 project


at
 scale
 and
 to
 deploy
 changes
 safely.


In
 in
 the
 case
 of
 how
 we
 work
 on
 versel


products,
 we
 always
 work
 on
 branches
 and


we
 take
 advantage
 of
 branch
 previews
 and


then
 we
 code
 review
 and
 then
 we
 merge


them.
 So
 what
 we're
 basically
 going
 to


be
 showing
 you
 today
 is
 how
 we
 brought


those
 ideas
 of
 hardcore


heavyduty


production
 grade
 engineering
 to
 visit.


So
 I'm
 here
 I'm
 binding
 that
 same


project
 that
 you
 just
 saw
 skills.sh


which
 is
 piped
 into
 is
 basically
 backed


by
 git
 the
 engineer
 who
 built
 this


pushed
 some
 code
 three
 hours
 ago
 and
 you


have
 this
 new
 button
 within
 v
 0ero
 which


is
 a
 new
 branch.
 So
 what
 this
 is
 showing


you
 is
 that
 B
 0
 is
 making
 the
 git
 flow


of
 creating
 branches
 a
 first
 class


citizen
 of
 the
 product.
 So
 I'm
 going
 to


create
 a
 branch


and
 basically
 this
 is
 going
 to
 give
 me


the
 same
 sort
 of
 like
 chat
 experience


you're
 used
 to.
 But
 notice
 here
 at
 the


top
 I
 get
 this
 beautiful
 new
 convention


of
 project
 slash
 branch.
 Right?
 So
 I


have
 the
 v
 0/rouchg


branch.
 And
 here
 within
 the
 preview,


you're
 going
 to
 notice
 that
 just
 like
 if


you
 had
 cloned
 the
 project
 to
 your
 local


device,
 we
 both
 have
 a
 full
 full
 scale


uh
 VS
 Code
 editor
 as
 well
 as
 the
 real


project
 running
 within
 VZ.
 One
 thing
 I


want
 to
 pause
 and
 notice
 because
 I
 just


have
 a
 laser
 eye
 for
 product
 is
 I
 love


that
 you
 use
 the
 convention
 that
 all
 of


us
 with
 engineering
 teams
 use
 on
 our
 git


branches
 which
 is
 who's
 the
 contributor


slash
 what's
 the
 feature
 and
 so
 what
 I


think
 this
 is
 really
 interesting
 you


know
 we're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 how
 you


actually
 use
 these
 tools
 to
 build
 but
 I


also
 think
 there's
 a
 flip
 side
 of
 how


you
 design
 great
 um
 AI
 products
 and


agentic
 products
 and
 I
 still
 like
 the


small
 design
 tweaks
 that
 make
 something


like
 a
 vzero
 feel
 like
 a
 collaborative


teammate
 on
 your


So
 I
 for
 all
 the
 engineers
 out
 there,
 I


noticed
 I
 noticed
 that
 little


convention.


>> So
 I
 and
 what
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 in
 the


design
 philosophy
 of
 the
 product
 is
 that


we
 really
 wanted
 to
 embed
 those
 little


details
 of
 what
 makes
 a
 real
 engineering


workflow
 come
 to
 life,
 but
 in
 a
 really


easy
 way,
 right?
 Like
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 I
 didn't
 have
 to
 go
 to
 a
 terminal


or
 boot
 up
 GitHub
 desktop
 and
 branch


manually.
 Like
 it's
 the
 stone
 age.
 I


just
 press
 a
 button
 and
 now
 I
 have
 a


branch
 running.
 So
 the
 main
 idea
 here
 is


that
 within
 this
 preview
 I
 have
 the
 full


skills.sh
 project
 running.
 It
 downloaded


dependencies.
 It
 installed
 the
 exact


versions
 of
 Nex.js
 and
 every
 dependency


uh
 within
 the
 project.
 I
 have
 it
 all


running
 here.
 I
 have
 it
 obviously
 within


a
 staging
 or
 dev
 sort
 of
 environment.


And
 now
 you
 know
 I
 I
 could
 navigate
 it


like
 uh
 I
 could
 navigate
 the
 production


website.
 I
 could
 explore
 it.
 I
 could,


you
 know,
 use
 all
 the
 capabilities
 that


Vzero
 uh
 brings
 to
 the
 table,
 but
 I


figured
 let's
 actually
 build
 a
 feature


that
 we
 could
 ship
 to
 prod.


>> Yeah.
 And
 one
 thing
 I
 want
 to
 pause
 on


what
 you
 I
 think
 glossed
 over
 a
 little


bit,
 which
 is
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 have


this
 VS
 Code
 instance,
 the
 fact
 that
 you


have
 all
 your
 dependencies
 installed,


the
 fact
 that
 this
 is
 running
 both
 with


code
 and
 a
 preview.
 For
 anybody
 who's


less
 technical
 out
 there,
 and
 maybe
 a


lot
 of
 your
 users
 that
 are
 using


vzero.app
 app
 are
 less
 technical.
 This


even
 like
 downloading
 VS
 Code,
 getting


your
 local
 environment
 set
 up,
 like
 I


spent
 this
 morning
 with
 my
 designer


installing
 homebrew
 like
 like
 it
 just


wasn't
 on
 her
 laptop.
 And
 so


>> it's
 nightmare
 feel.


>> It's
 nightmare.
 And
 so
 if
 you're
 trying


to
 step
 from
 this
 like
 vibe
 coding


prototype
 in
 web
 experience
 into
 feeling


more
 like
 a
 software
 engineer
 without


having
 to
 have
 Claire
 handhold
 you


through
 like
 brew
 install,
 this
 gets
 you


like
 halfway
 there.
 And
 so
 I
 think


there's
 also
 this
 learning
 aspect
 of
 it


I
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 people
 don't
 miss.


But
 let's
 get
 into
 building
 something


obvious.


>> So
 one
 another
 part
 of
 our
 product


development
 process
 is
 really
 listening


to
 community
 and
 listening
 to
 customers.


So
 people
 have
 been
 asking
 for
 a
 lot
 of


different
 tools
 so
 that
 we
 could
 guide


them
 towards
 knowing
 if
 a
 skill
 is
 high


quality,
 vetted,
 verified
 because


there's
 so
 many
 skills.
 At
 last
 we


checked
 there
 were
 500
 skills
 being


added
 every
 hour.
 And
 so
 one
 of the


ideas
 that
 we
 came
 up
 with
 is
 like
 could


we
 add
 um
 a
 rating
 system.
 So
 let's
 add


a
 fivestarbased


rating
 system
 for
 the
 skills.
 Uh
 put
 it


on
 the
 sidebar.


Um
 be
 mindful.
 So
 I'll
 also
 give
 you


like
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 my
 real
 time


consciousness
 on
 if
 I
 were
 talking
 to
 an


engineer
 and
 say
 like
 what
 could
 go


wrong
 if
 we
 accept
 ratings
 from
 the


internet.
 One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 can
 go


wrong
 if
 you
 accept
 ratings
 from
 is


abuse.
 So
 let's
 say
 let's
 tell
 VZ
 be


mindful
 that
 uh
 we
 should
 rate
 limit
 or


prevent
 abuse
 on
 the
 scores
 that
 we


receive.
 And
 again,
 for
 me,
 it's
 all


about
 thinking
 from
 a
 production


readiness
 point
 of
 view
 when
 I
 think


about
 the
 new
 VZO
 and
 make
 it
 make
 sense


within
 the
 style
 of
 this
 skills
 website.


>> What
 I
 love
 about
 what
 you're
 showing
 us


is
 you
 have
 this
 very
 very
 high


sophistication
 prompt
 here,
 which
 is


make
 it
 make
 sense.
 So,
 we
 have
 three


three
 incomplete
 sentences
 on
 a


production
 app
 serving
 thousands,


millions
 of
 people.
 and
 you're
 going
 to


fire
 it
 off.
 And
 while
 you
 do
 this,
 one


of the
 things
 I
 want
 to
 just
 call
 out


that
 I
 think
 you
 know
 why
 this
 feature


is
 maybe
 important
 right
 now
 is
 I
 don't


know
 if
 you've
 heard
 there's
 like
 this


crustation
 crawling
 all
 over
 everybody's


MacBook
 minis
 and
 skills
 can
 be
 a
 a


prompt
 injected
 vector
 for
 things.
 And


so
 as
 you're
 trying
 to
 make
 sure
 that


this
 becomes
 the
 centralized
 hub
 for


discovering
 skills,
 which
 I
 think
 it's


starting
 to
 be,
 it
 is
 upon
 you
 to
 kind


of
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 quality
 is
 there,


at least
 you
 have
 the
 right
 thing
 um


right
 things
 in
 place
 so
 people
 can
 make


the
 decision
 to
 follow
 with
 your


analogy.
 This
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 like
 we're


vibe
 coding
 on
 top
 github.com
 or


npmjs.com.
 It's
 like
 a
 really
 really
 big


deal.


>> All right.
 So
 I
 was
 going
 to
 walk
 you


through
 what
 Vzero
 is
 doing
 which
 of


course
 if
 you've
 used
 V
 0ero
 before
 we


everyone
 does
 the
 whole
 like
 talk
 over


the
 thinking
 trace
 because
 agents
 are


not
 the
 fastest
 but
 I
 do
 want
 to
 point


out
 a
 few
 things
 that
 are
 really


important.
 So
 um
 D0
 is
 all
 about


leveraging
 the
 integration
 and


marketplace
 capabilities
 of
 RCEL.
 So
 in


this
 case
 it
 knows
 what
 the
 data
 source


is
 of
 this
 project
 right
 we're
 storing


data
 in
 reddis
 by
 app
 stash
 obviously


it's
 going to
 go
 through
 the
 whole
 file


system
 it's
 going to
 try
 to
 interpret
 my


requirements
 this
 is
 already
 like
 really


nice
 to
 see
 that
 it's
 not
 inventing
 a


new
 way
 to
 store
 the
 data
 like
 it's


actually
 paying
 attention
 to
 the
 data


that
 I
 use


um
 and
 so
 we'll
 take
 a
 look
 at
 uh
 again


here
 like
 it
 actually
 gave
 me
 something


that


meets
 my
 requirements
 right?
 Like
 it


fits
 within
 the
 design
 style.
 I
 can


submit
 a
 rating.
 It
 is
 stores
 the


rating.
 So
 I
 have
 now
 my
 fivestar
 one


rating.
 I
 guess
 I'm
 going
 to


>> It's
 terminal
 core


monace
 font.


>> Um
 let's
 refresh
 the
 page
 to
 see
 that


persistence
 actually
 works.
 Beautiful.


There's
 a
 tiny
 bit
 of
 layout
 shift
 that


triggers
 my
 neurosis.
 So
 we'll
 tell
 it,


hey,
 when
 we
 don't
 have
 data,
 make
 sure


there's
 no
 layout
 shift.
 By
 the
 way,
 for


those
 of
 you
 that
 are
 like
 less


neurotic,
 I
 guess.
 So,
 it
 bothered
 me


that
 when
 we
 refreshed
 the
 page,
 when
 we


didn't
 have
 data,
 like
 it
 jittered
 the


sidebar
 a
 little
 bit.
 So,
 we're
 just


going
 to
 have
 the
 zero.


>> So,
 while
 we're
 uh
 jibber
 jabbering


while
 the
 it's
 thinking,
 which
 I
 have
 to


get
 very
 good
 at
 as
 a
 podcast.
 So,
 I


will
 call
 out
 that
 I
 have
 observed
 a


Verscell
 internal
 hackathon
 and
 I
 have


seen
 this
 man
 screenshot
 like
 rounded


corners
 that
 are
 not
 right
 and
 just
 put


them
 in
 the
 chat
 with
 like
 a
 question


mark.
 And
 so
 it's
 it's
 yeah
 it
 it
 speaks


to
 my
 um


>> my
 very
 attention
 to
 detail
 heart
 that


you
 saw
 you
 saw
 that
 did
 it
 work.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 No,
 I'm
 fairly
 satisfied


like
 the
 Yeah.


>> The
 skeleton
 was
 stable.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Uh
 zero
 layout
 shift.
 So
 let's
 continue


with
 the
 we
 we
 talked
 about
 this
 uh


hardcore


uh
 engineering
 workflow
 like
 if
 if
 we


were
 making
 a
 change
 like
 this
 on
 skills


age
 again
 receiving
 hundreds
 of
 skills


per
 hour
 with
 lots
 of
 visitors
 we
 first


want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 things
 work
 right


and
 right
 now
 you
 you
 can
 think
 of
 this


as
 a
 very
 capable
 dev
 environment
 we're


booting
 up
 the
 NexJS
 dev
 server
 in
 a


virtual
 machine
 it's
 it's
 it's
 basically


very
 true
 to
 the
 actual
 end
 result.
 In


fact,
 thank
 you
 to
 the
 Nex.js
 engineers


who
 sweated
 all
 of
 the
 details
 of


mirroring
 to
 the
 best
 of
 their
 ability


the
 dev
 environment
 and
 the
 production


environment.
 But
 there
 is
 another
 layer


of
 assurance
 that
 we
 can
 get,
 right,


which
 is
 so
 if
 you're
 more
 familiar
 with


the
 g
 like
 the
 GitHub
 world,
 the
 GitHub


side
 of
 things,
 you
 know
 that
 when
 you


push
 a
 new
 PR
 to
 GitHub,
 the
 this


beautiful
 Versel
 bot
 comes
 to
 sort
 of


save
 the
 day,
 right?
 you
 know
 that
 it


builds
 what
 you
 what
 you're
 changing
 and


then
 it
 previews
 it.
 Not
 only
 that,
 but


notice
 that
 Vzero
 really
 cooks.
 Vzero
 is


making
 me
 look
 so
 good
 here
 because
 I


haven't
 written
 a
 PR
 description
 in
 like


25
 years
 84
 years.
 So
 Vzero
 produced
 a


PR
 described
 it
 um
 and
 then
 the
 magic
 of


our
 cell
 is
 coming
 in
 right
 so
 it's


giving
 me
 that
 uh
 preview.
 So
 I'm
 going


to
 I'm
 going
 to
 open
 it
 here.
 I'm
 going


to
 say
 visit
 preview.
 I
 I'm
 just
 again


I'm
 going
 to
 be
 a
 software
 engineer
 for


a
 second.
 Can
 we
 appreciate
 how
 quickly


that
 preview
 branch
 deployed?


>> Well,
 don't
 trigger
 me
 because
 it
 can
 be


10
 times
 quicker.
 But
 yeah,
 I'm
 proud
 of


it.


>> Explain.


>> Now
 I
 have
 a
 production-like


environment.
 So
 when
 you
 see
 this
 URL


ending
 onverell.sh


is
 our
 enterprise
 versell
 environment.


That's
 why
 it
 had
 the
 17
 steps
 of


logging
 in.
 Um
 but
 this
 is
 basically


running
 on
 the
 production
 grade
 CDN
 on


the
 production
 grade
 rendering


infrastructure
 hosting
 infrastructure


etc.
 So
 now
 when
 I'm
 seeing
 that
 you


know
 rating
 there
 I
 have
 pretty
 pretty


good
 confidence.
 I
 was
 like
 yeah
 this
 is


shippable.


>> Okay
 so
 I
 have
 to
 ask
 a
 couple
 questions


about
 the
 you
 know
 inside
 the
 house
 view


of
 this.
 Is
 this
 how
 you
 all
 are


shipping
 code
 or
 is
 this
 a
 big
 chunk
 of


how
 you're
 shipping
 code
 to
 this?
 Is
 it


100%?
 How
 are
 you
 actually
 using
 this


for
 production?


>> So
 it's
 really
 interesting.
 We
 when
 we


cook
 on
 a
 on
 a
 project
 or
 a
 product


internally,
 we
 hold
 ourselves
 to
 the


same
 sort
 of
 high
 bar
 as
 if
 you
 had


launched
 a
 product
 externally
 because


you
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 people
 are


actually
 adopting
 it,
 right?
 And
 so


before
 before
 we
 started
 chatting
 and


I'm
 going
 to
 give
 you
 a
 glimpse
 of
 again


the
 behind
 the
 scenes
 of
 Verscell,
 uh


we've
 talked
 a
 lot
 publicly
 about
 our


data
 analyst
 agent
 D0.
 Yes,
 we're
 very


creative
 with
 with
 names.
 We
 take
 the


first
 initial
 and
 we
 add
 a
 zero.
 So
 this


is
 our
 data
 uh
 AI
 powered
 assistant
 and


I
 was
 actually
 asking
 it
 um
 I
 said
 um


Vzero
 this
 is
 me
 by
 the
 way
 uh
 tell
 me


about
 PR's
 merged
 with
 Vzero
 in
 the


recent
 weeks
 tell
 me
 about
 its
 growth
 so


again
 PR's
 merged
 with
 DZ
 is
 a
 totally


novel
 thing
 and
 DZ
 cooked
 thank
 you
 DZ


it
 said
 PRs
 merged
 via
 DZ
 have
 seen


explosive
 growth
 in
 the
 last
 week
 wow


explo
 explosive
 growth.


>> I
 have
 to
 appreciate
 whoever
 prompt


managed
 this
 one
 because
 it
 did
 not
 put


the
 explosion
 of
 OG
 in
 there,
 which
 I


think
 would
 also
 trigger
 G.


>> All
 right,
 we
 should
 uh
 Yeah.
 Uh
 trigger


warning.
 Starting
 from
 near
 zero
 in


early
 January,
 the
 feature
 hit
 3200
 PR


submerged
 per
 day
 by
 January
 2829,
 which


is
 basically
 today.
 An
 extraordinary


100x.
 The
 bots,
 the
 AIS
 do
 like
 to
 like


like
 Yeah.
 like
 sweet
 sweet
 tacas.
 But


um
 it's
 it's
 pretty
 amazing.
 So
 this
 is


in
 very
 very very
 early
 uh
 preview,


right?
 Like
 we
 we're
 just
 letting
 people


in.
 But
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 just
 such
 a


beautiful
 workflow.
 I
 mean
 imagine


triggering
 a
 task
 like
 this
 from
 your


phone,
 from
 Slack,
 from
 vzero.app.


Another
 convenience
 that
 we're
 adding
 is


that
 you
 can
 take
 a
 a
 U
 GitHub
 repo
 like


this
 and
 I
 can
 go
 to
 the
 homepage
 and


then
 I
 can
 paste
 it.
 And
 so
 now
 I
 could


import
 something
 that
 I
 already
 have
 and


create
 a
 chat
 from
 it.
 So
 anytime
 I
 have


an
 idea
 for
 a
 realworld
 project
 and


product
 that
 has
 in
 production,
 I
 can


now
 prompt.
 So
 I
 estimate
 that
 this
 is


going
 to
 change
 fundamentally
 how
 we


work,
 right?
 Uh
 it's
 also
 very
 visual
 in


nature
 which
 is
 really
 cool.
 Obviously,


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 ways
 of
 like
 getting


preview
 getting
 uh
 changes
 made
 by


agents
 today
 out
 out
 there
 in
 the
 world.


These
 everyone's
 very
 excited
 about
 what


what
 AI
 can
 do,
 but
 this
 is
 actually


showing
 me
 the
 the
 actual
 results
 and


like
 things
 that
 are
 going
 to
 happen.


So,
 I
 I
 grade
 this
 really
 high
 for
 the


kind
 of
 products
 that
 we
 build
 at
 VCell


and
 uh
 I
 expect
 this
 to
 continue
 to
 have


a
 lot
 of
 traction.


>> So,
 I
 have
 to
 ask
 you
 sort
 of


operationally,
 how
 do
 you
 imagine


companies
 do
 this?
 And
 one
 of
 the
 things


I'm
 thinking
 is
 I
 was
 chatting
 with


Caroline
 who
 interrupted
 you
 all
 and
 say


we're
 said
 we're
 going
 to
 start
 the


podcast
 and
 she
 said
 last
 night
 I
 was


prepping
 for
 this
 demo
 and
 I
 vzero
 coded


something
 and
 somebody
 saw
 it
 and
 was


like
 well
 that's
 a
 good
 idea
 you
 should


just
 merge
 it
 and
 ship
 it
 like
 do
 you


imagine
 or
 inside
 the
 company
 who's


shipping
 code
 how
 are
 you
 enabling
 that


as
 a
 CEO
 how
 does
 the
 culture
 support
 it


how
 does
 it
 not


>> until
 now
 everyone
 could
 cook
 right


everyone
 could
 create
 a
 prototype
 a
 new


design
 a
 suggestion.
 In
 fact,
 uh,
 moment


of
 vulnerability
 because
 I
 haven't


really
 even
 opened
 this
 in
 a
 while,
 but


like,
 uh,
 let's
 see
 if
 I
 have
 I
 probably


created
 a
 bunch
 of
 things
 that
 I've
 been


suggesting
 to
 the
 teams
 that
 we
 could


look
 at,
 right?
 Um,
 ignore
 this
 one
 for


a
 second,
 but
 um,
 so
 anytime
 I
 have
 an


idea
 on
 how
 to
 improve
 the
 product,
 I


nowadays
 create
 a
 Vzero.
 Now
 the


difference
 is
 that
 until
 I
 had
 this


mechanism
 to
 hand
 it
 off
 as
 a
 pull


request
 to
 the
 engineering
 team
 then
 I


was
 kind
 of
 like
 playing
 in
 La
 La Lands.


I
 was
 like
 in
 out
 there
 in
 this
 like


prototype
 world
 and
 now
 we
 have
 a
 common


foundation
 and
 a
 common
 substrate
 so


that
 if
 you
 have
 an
 idea
 whether
 you


work
 in
 marketing
 like
 marketers
 always


want
 to
 change
 the
 website
 like
 imagine


like
 go
 to
 verscell.com
 I'll
 show
 you
 a


page
 that
 is
 actually
 quite
 uh
 fun
 at


versell
 so
 our
 enterprise
 page
 every


marketer
 of
 versell
 wants
 to
 change
 this


page
 at
 some
 point
 right
 and
 the
 old
 way


was
 to
 one
 of
 one
 of
 two
 ways.
 One
 is


what
 I
 called
 you
 had
 to
 petition
 to
 the


government.
 You
 had
 to
 go
 to
 engineers


and
 say
 engineers
 please
 can
 you
 can
 you


please
 add
 a
 logo
 over
 here
 or
 whatnot


or
 pray
 that
 the
 CMS
 was
 perfectly
 wired


up
 for
 any
 ambition
 or
 dream
 or
 idea
 you


had.
 So
 now
 they
 can
 just
 open
 this
 page


in
 VZ
 and
 prompt
 anything
 that
 they


want.
 But
 it
 would
 be
 somewhat


irresponsible
 to
 just
 ship
 it,
 right?
 So


with
 the
 Git
 workflow
 and
 opening
 a
 PR


and
 being
 able
 to
 preview
 it,
 we
 can
 all


build
 confidence
 that
 it's
 going to
 be
 a


good
 change,
 roll
 it
 back
 if
 needed,
 and


and
 again,
 this
 is
 a
 website
 that's
 it's


pretty
 pretty
 large.


>> What
 I
 think
 is
 fun
 about
 this
 from
 an


org
 perspect
 perspective
 is
 it
 reduces


the
 friction
 of
 getting
 something
 live


really
 really
 low,
 right?
 And
 like
 the


humiliation
 ritual
 of
 prioritization


goes
 away
 and
 you
 can
 actually
 focus


your
 time
 on
 defending
 the
 merits
 of
 an


idea
 on
 the
 actual
 idea
 as
 opposed
 to


the
 hypothesis
 of
 the
 idea
 that
 then
 has


to
 be
 implemented.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 it


changes
 the
 speed
 of
 companies
 in
 in
 a


really
 significant
 way.
 And
 you
 worked
 I


mean
 to
 say
 the
 least
 at
 launch
 darkly


>> and
 you
 know
 that
 a
 true
 production


grade
 release
 process
 involves
 things


like
 feature
 flags
 and
 experiments
 and


things
 need
 to
 be
 measured
 and
 there's


events
 that
 are
 critical
 to
 report
 from


these
 product
 surfaces.
 And
 so
 this
 is


also
 where
 I
 see
 the
 um
 skills
 that
 we


can
 add
 to
 vzero
 and
 that
 you
 can


contribute
 yourself
 to
 play
 a
 very


important
 role
 because
 sometimes
 you


know
 like
 we're
 all
 operating
 on
 this


like
 websites
 and
 pixels
 and
 whatnot
 and


we
 say
 like
 ah
 it's
 seems
 easy
 how
 risky


could
 it
 be
 to
 move
 this
 button
 20


pixels
 to
 the
 right
 and
 so
 I
 think
 we


can
 make
 vibe
 coding
 scale
 to
 that
 kind


of
 rigor
 that
 exists
 within
 enterprises


and
 companies
 at
 scale


>> well
 and
 if
 we're
 being
 honest
 on
 that


enterprise
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 moving
 a


button
 two
 pixels.
 It's
 going
 to
 be


switching
 the
 emphasis.
 I
 know
 this
 cuz


I
 spent
 my
 life
 in
 enterprise.
 Switching


the
 emphasis
 between
 contact
 sales
 and


view
 the
 product.
 There's
 going
 to
 be
 a


perpetual
 debate
 which
 one's
 the
 primary


call
 to
 action
 and
 which
 is
 the


secondary.


>> Okay.
 I
 we
 so
 we've
 shown
 uh
 new
 v0ero


import
 GitHub
 which
 I
 think
 is
 really


great.
 Do
 a
 pull
 request.
 Copy
 and
 paste


your
 GitHub
 URL
 in
 to
 import
 it.


Actually
 push
 to
 production.
 Make


friends
 with
 your
 engineers.
 three


sentence
 prompting,
 no
 more
 than
 that.
 I


want
 to
 go
 to
 quick
 because
 we
 want
 to


keep
 this
 tight.
 I
 want
 to
 go
 to
 a
 quick


lightning
 round
 with
 you
 and
 ask
 you
 a


couple
 different
 AI
 questions.
 So,
 what


is
 your
 favorite
 non
 I
 mean
 everything's


a
 coding
 use
 case,
 I'm
 sure,
 with
 you,


but
 what
 is
 your
 favorite
 non-coding
 use


case
 of
 AI?


>> Well,
 I'm
 conflicted.
 My
 mind


immediately
 went
 to
 image
 generation


because
 I
 used
 uh
 so
 we
 built
 a
 banger


playground.
 Uh
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 share


screen
 again.
 I
 want
 to
 take
 it
 from


you.
 But


>> this
 is
 Oh,
 no.
 I
 was
 just
 going
 to
 say


image
 generation
 is
 how
 I
 got
 this


pretty
 pretty
 background.


>> Um
 bzero
 nano
 banana


>> pro.
 Nano
 banana.


>> So
 what's
 really
 cool
 that's
 happening


at
 Verscell
 today
 is
 that
 we're
 building


so
 many
 of
 our
 own
 internal
 tools
 and


agents
 and
 so
 we're
 building
 our
 own


design
 tools
 like
 for
 example
 to
 create


new
 images.
 We
 created
 a
 playground
 for


Nan
 Banana
 and
 I
 use
 that
 a
 lot.
 So
 I


use
 it
 to
 make
 memes
 uh
 guilty
 is


charged.
 Uh,
 but
 I
 also
 use
 it
 when
 I


want
 to
 present
 information
 in
 really


cool
 ways.
 When
 I
 tweet,
 when
 I


sometimes
 I
 have
 to
 make
 u
 present
 my


vision
 in
 a
 way
 that's
 more
 like
 on
 the


image
 side
 of
 things.
 I
 combine
 it
 a
 lot


with
 vzero
 because
 nanobana
 is
 really


good
 at
 like
 again
 letting
 me
 fire
 off


20
 generations
 in
 parallel
 and
 then
 pick


the
 one
 that
 I
 actually
 like
 and
 then
 I


toss
 it
 into
 v
 0ero
 and
 then
 I
 actually


get
 more
 fidelity
 of
 what
 I
 want
 to


implement.
 So
 image
 generation
 is
 is
 a


big
 one,
 but
 also
 I'm
 very
 excited
 about


video
 generation.
 We're
 going
 to
 be


dropping
 something.
 I
 don't
 want
 to


spoil
 it
 too
 much.
 Uh
 we're
 going
 to
 be


dropping
 something
 uh
 on
 the
 video
 side


as
 well.
 Um
 and
 but
 yeah,
 all
 all
 AI
 is


uh
 I
 also
 I
 also
 kick
 off
 a
 lot
 of


research
 tasks
 like
 long
 horizon


research
 tasks.
 Uh
 yeah.
 So,
 one
 of
 the


things
 I
 want
 to
 call
 out
 from
 a
 Nano


Banana
 perspective
 on
 our
 podcast
 is


I've
 used
 Nano
 Banana
 to
 turn
 every


conversation,
 I
 think
 we're
 now
 at
 118


workflows,
 every
 AI
 workflow
 that
 we


talk
 about
 on
 the
 podcast
 gets
 its
 own


pretty
 consistent
 nano
 banana


infographic.
 And
 so,
 I
 just
 think


there's
 just
 such
 undervalued
 use
 cases


in
 both
 idio
 uh
 image
 and
 videogen.
 And


I'm
 about
 to
 take
 this
 and
 turn
 them
 all


into
 little
 mini
 videos.


>> We
 also
 created
 a
 really
 awesome
 I
 don't


know if
 we've
 written
 about
 it
 yet.
 that


we're
 publishing
 on
 the
 blog
 post.
 We


have
 an
 uh
 OG
 image
 like
 open
 graph


card,
 Twitter
 card
 generator
 that
 we
 use


internally
 that
 combines
 uh
 more


traditional
 rendering
 techniques
 but


also
 image
 generation.
 So
 a
 bottleneck


in
 our
 team
 was
 sometimes
 literally
 like


can
 we
 get
 that
 social
 card
 to
 get
 the


announcement
 through
 the
 door.


>> And
 so
 now
 we
 we've
 also
 sort
 of


automated
 and
 identify
 that.
 Every
 day


we're
 basically
 asking
 ourselves
 how
 can


we
 build
 an
 agent
 that
 takes
 over
 a
 task


that
 we
 were
 previously
 giving
 to
 a


person
 and
 uh
 and
 typically
 the
 person


that
 was
 working
 on
 that
 task
 is
 now
 the


one
 creating
 the
 agent.
 Yeah.
 So


something
 we
 said
 at
 the
 beginning
 is
 we


want
 B
 zero
 to
 be
 really
 awesome
 for
 you


all
 to
 create
 agents
 not
 just


traditional
 web
 applications.
 So
 that's


that's
 basically
 the
 the
 the
 road
 map
 of


the
 product.


>> So
 I
 have
 to
 say
 uh
 my
 favorite
 so


that's
 your
 favorite
 use
 case.
 My


favorite
 use
 case
 of
 your
 use
 of
 VZero


which
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you're
 you're


prepared
 for
 me
 to
 have
 this
 much


knowledge
 about
 what
 you
 vibe
 code
 is


your
 Asiato
 Asia
 chess
 game.


>> My
 kids
 are
 obsessed
 with
 this.
 They


think
 it's
 because
 they
 got
 the
 AI
 chess


board
 and
 now
 they're
 like
 playing
 chess


at
 various
 levels.


>> By
 the
 way,
 I
 learned
 a
 lot.
 So,
 so
 it


was
 really
 cool
 like
 during
 the
 holidays


I
 uh
 I'm
 a
 I'm
 kind
 of
 a
 visual
 person.


>> So,
 the
 chess
 AI
 thing
 has
 been
 done


before,
 but
 I
 imagined
 this
 sort
 of
 um


imagine
 like
 ESPN
 is
 is
 is
 is


broadcasting
 a
 a
 final
 of
 a
 chess
 match


and
 they're
 going
 over
 the
 shoulder
 of


each
 player
 and
 showing
 the
 the
 the


chessboard
 obviously
 in
 3D.
 And
 so
 I
 I


figured
 could
 could
 V
 0
 generate
 3D


code,
 right?
 Could
 it
 render
 with
 3JS


and
 things
 like
 that
 a
 uh
 a
 live
 chess


match
 and
 could
 I
 have
 two
 AIs
 battle
 it


out?
 And
 so
 um
 I
 mean
 you
 could
 open
 it.


So
 the
 zero-
 chess-match.resellapp.


Um
 and
 the
 other
 thing
 the
 other
 thing
 I


wonder
 if
 I
 am
 SEOed
 or
 not.


>> You
 you're
 number
 one.
 Good
 job.


>> Oh,
 yes.


>> Oh,
 a
 little
 terminal
 core
 over
 here.


>> So,
 terminal
 core,
 of
 course.
 But,
 uh,


so
 what
 I
 did
 is
 I
 I
 I
 started
 streaming


the
 thinking
 tokens
 of
 the
 models.
 Uh,


apologies
 to
 Google
 in
 advance.
 Uh,


we're
 using
 a
 very
 old
 model
 of
 theirs


that
 is
 really
 cheap,
 but
 they're
 losing


two
 225.


At
 least
 they
 got
 five
 in.
 So,
 you
 can


see
 the
 thinking
 tokens
 of
 the
 models.


This
 is
 combining
 all
 of
 the
 Versel
 AI


infrastructure.
 It's
 using
 a
 workflow
 so


the
 game
 could
 run
 forever.
 The
 game


could
 literally
 run
 forever
 or
 or
 until


I
 run
 out
 of
 tokens.


>> AI
 gateway.


>> Uh
 AI
 gateway
 of
 course
 because
 we
 can


change
 models
 like
 we
 could
 we
 could
 see


like
 Brock
 versus
 you
 know
 uh
 whatever


uh
 what
 dropped
 this
 week
 when
 threeax


thinking.
 Uh
 but
 also
 I
 learned
 chess


incidentally
 because
 not
 from
 these


guys.
 These
 guys
 are
 kind
 of
 dumb.
 Uh,


you
 can
 see
 how
 it
 thinks
 through
 what


piece
 to
 move
 and
 it
 says,
 "Oh,
 no,


because
 if
 I
 move
 it
 there,
 I'm
 going
 to


get
 F.
 So,
 I
 need
 to
 do
 this."
 So,
 this


is
 a
 fun
 visor
 created
 during
 the


holidays.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 need
 a
 kid
 core
 version
 of


this.
 Um,
 I
 also
 want
 to
 see
 how
 much


these
 models
 are
 spending
 to
 beat
 and


lose.


>> Well,
 beautiful
 thing
 about
 the
 AI


gateway
 is
 that
 we
 kind
 of
 report,
 you


know,
 for
 this
 prompt,
 how
 much
 did
 it


cost
 you
 with
 this
 model,
 etc.
 Um,
 but


see,
 so
 this
 is
 GPT
 open
 source
 which
 is


actually
 pretty
 decent
 and
 uh
 pretty


cheap.
 So


>> great.
 And
 then
 so
 on
 this
 so
 that's
 my


kids
 favorite
 your
 V0.


>> I
 don't
 know if
 they
 have
 a
 favorite
 my


V.


>> It's
 popular
 with
 kids.
 I
 also
 got


another
 parent
 reach
 out
 to
 me
 and
 say


like
 oh
 this
 really
 inspired
 us
 and


we're
 going
 to
 use
 Vzero
 together
 to


create
 more
 things.


>> My
 kids
 a a
 DAU
 on
 VZero.
 Don't
 worry


about
 it.
 So
 this
 is
 my
 second
 question


which
 is
 what
 is
 the
 last
 thing
 you


built
 with
 your
 kids
 that
 was
 really


fun.
 So
 the
 other
 day
 I
 brought
 them
 all


to
 the
 office
 and
 what
 we
 started
 vibe


coding
 is
 so
 now
 we
 want
 to
 do
 things


that
 are
 more
 like
 physical
 AI
 like


bring
 AI
 to
 the
 real
 world.
 I
 think
 it's


the
 next
 frontier
 and
 so
 at
 the
 office


we
 have
 a
 a
 thing
 called
 Vesta
 board


which
 is
 a
 board
 where
 you
 can
 basically


render
 things
 in
 the
 real
 world.


>> And
 I
 think
 I
 really
 broke
 their
 their


brains
 that
 day.
 Not
 all
 of
 them
 because


I
 I
 brought
 four
 of
 them
 and
 one
 was
 on


his
 iPad
 not
 paying
 attention.
 It
 was


almost
 like
 bringing
 them
 to
 Sunday


school
 for
 what
 it's
 worth.
 Uh
 but
 two


of
 them
 were
 like,
 "Holy
 crap,
 you
 can


type
 in
 code
 and
 then
 you
 can
 change
 the


real
 world."
 So
 I
 kind
 of
 taught
 them


the
 concept
 of
 an
 API.
 Uh
 and
 yeah,
 all


vibe
 coded
 and
 um
 I
 I
 took
 one
 of
 the


nannies
 too
 and
 she
 was
 mind-blown.


>> Well,
 that
 is
 teaching
 everyone
 how
 to
 v


code.
 That
 is
 uh
 you
 and
 I
 we're
 like


twin
 stars
 here
 because
 while
 you
 have


the
 Vesta
 board
 which
 is
 pretty
 big,
 I


have
 this
 like
 tiny
 like
 32x32
 pixel


fake
 little
 mini
 computer
 that
 my
 kids


and
 I
 are
 like
 vibe
 coding
 little


screens
 on
 and
 little
 games
 on.
 So
 I


completely
 agree.
 Take
 it
 off
 the
 screen


for
 many
 reasons.
 If
 you
 have
 kids,
 put


it
 in
 the
 real
 world
 and
 you
 can
 do
 some


fun
 stuff
 and
 blow
 their
 mind.


>> Sending
 a
 packet
 and
 responding
 to
 it.


And
 the
 beautiful
 thing
 about
 Vzero
 and


things
 like
 this
 is
 like
 you're


literally
 speaking
 English
 to
 the


computer.
 So
 I
 think
 if
 you
 can
 teach


them
 that
 they
 can
 express
 their


thoughts
 and
 desires,
 then
 they
 can
 make


anything
 happen.


>> Okay,
 important
 question.
 Are
 you


teaching
 your
 kids
 to
 type?


>> That's
 a
 tough
 one
 because
 I
 was
 when
 I


grew
 up
 in
 Argentina,
 my
 dad
 got
 me
 this


soccer
 game.
 He
 tricked
 me.
 I
 thought,


"Oh,
 he's
 getting
 me
 FIFA
 or
 something


cool."
 No,
 he
 got
 me
 a
 soccer
 typing


game.


So
 to
 score,
 I
 had
 to
 type
 really
 fast.


And
 that's
 how
 you
 learn
 to
 type
 really


fast.
 But
 nowadays,
 like
 they're
 kind
 of


getting
 really
 into
 the
 the
 speech
 to


text
 thing.
 I
 need
 to
 find
 that
 hack


where
 like,
 "Oh,
 I
 got
 you
 Roblox."
 And


it's
 not.
 It's
 just
 typing.


>> It's
 just
 typing.
 So,
 I
 uh
 I
 I'm


tricking
 my
 youngests
 right
 now.
 We
 have


a
 Switch
 and
 I
 really
 want
 to
 play


Ocarina
 of
 Time
 for
 people
 that
 were


born
 when
 that
 game
 came
 out
 a
 million


years
 ago.
 And
 the
 only
 reason
 I
 let
 him


play
 it
 is
 it's
 like
 99%
 just
 reading.


>> And
 so
 I'm
 like,
 you
 can
 play
 this
 very


slow
 paced
 game.
 It's
 a
 game.
 It's


really
 just
 going
 NPC
 to
 NPC
 and
 reading


to


>> phrases.
 So
 we
 played
 a
 game
 like
 this


with
 my
 kids
 during
 the
 holiday
 break.


Um
 it
 was
 basically
 like
 a
 puzzle
 math


game
 that
 looked
 like
 a
 game
 and
 that


inspired.
 So
 okay,
 good
 and
 bad.
 The


good
 was
 the
 game
 was
 like
 really


educational.
 The
 bad
 was
 like
 it
 was


like
 at
 ridden
 brain
 rot
 slop.


And
 so
 it's
 like
 okay
 huge
 opportunity


for
 someone
 to
 create
 a
 game
 platform.


You
 can
 combine
 all
 of
 these
 models.
 You


can
 do
 image
 generation
 for
 the
 assets.


We're
 about
 to
 drop
 something
 insanely


cool
 text
 to
 SVG.
 There's
 models
 that


now
 produce
 really
 really
 high
 qual.


We're
 going
 to
 uh
 share
 recraft
 models


through
 the
 Verscell
 AI
 gateway.
 So
 you


can
 create
 assets
 that
 are
 beautiful


game
 ready
 scalable
 in
 high
 DPI
 screens


whatever
 iPad.
 And
 so
 I
 really
 I
 I
 I
 I


see
 the
 future
 of
 really
 high
 quality


content
 uh
 at
 our
 fingertips
 uh
 and


getting
 rid
 of
 all
 this
 slop.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 um
 I
 you
 know
 my
 my
 future


roadmap
 releases
 are
 not
 as
 confidential


as
 yours
 and
 so
 I
 am
 in
 the
 back
 of
 my


mind
 working
 on
 like
 Mama
 Claire's
 dojo


for
 Crack
 Little
 Hackers.


>> Nice.


>> So
 maybe
 someday
 and
 deployed
 on


obviously
 Verscell.
 Okay,
 last
 question.


Uh,
 do
 you
 when
 you're
 frustrated
 prompt


AI
 the
 same
 way
 I
 have
 seen
 you
 prompt


in
 Zoom
 chat
 which
 is
 explain
 how
 do
 you


how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 you
 yeah
 question
 mark


like
 what
 do
 you
 do
 when
 it's
 not
 giving


you
 what
 you
 want?
 So
 I
 I
 do
 think
 that


what
 we
 what
 we're
 dropping
 now
 is
 going


to
 help
 you
 so
 much
 for
 the
 moments


where
 I
 mean
 let's
 be
 real
 you
 can
 get


stuck
 with
 AI
 right
 but
 now
 that
 you
 can


essentially
 have
 this
 full
 like
 let's


call
 it
 escape
 hatch
 right
 like
 you
 can


if
 you
 want
 you
 can
 clone
 the
 repo
 and


keep
 cooking
 on
 your
 local
 machine
 or
 if


you
 need
 some
 someone
 else
 to
 help
 you


this
 is
 fundamentally
 a
 collaborative


medium
 that's
 the
 thing
 that
 GitHub


unlocked
 for
 the
 world
 collaboration


between
 engineers
 designers
 marketers


and
 So
 um
 I
 I
 foresee
 that
 a
 lot
 less


people
 are
 going
 to
 get
 stuck
 frankly.


The
 models
 also
 keep
 getting
 smarter.


Skills
 is
 going
 to
 help
 you
 a
 lot
 as


well.
 So
 I'll
 give
 you
 an
 example.
 We


are
 always
 adding
 new
 frameworks
 and
 new


capabilities
 and
 XJS
 is
 getting
 more


powerful
 and
 the
 AI
 SDK
 now
 that
 we
 have


skills
 for
 those
 that
 we're
 going
 to


preload
 into
 vo
 the
 model
 itself
 is
 not


going to
 get
 it
 stuck
 as
 easily
 because


now
 it
 has
 more
 resources
 to
 like
 figure


out
 how
 to
 solve
 that
 problem.
 Another


thing
 that
 I've
 done
 it
 actually
 used
 it


for
 this
 project.
 So
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


subtleties
 about
 this
 this
 3D
 thing
 that


I
 didn't
 know
 anything
 about
 3D.
 So


whenever
 I
 would
 get
 stuck,
 I
 would
 ask


other
 models.
 Um
 I
 think
 it
 was


something
 about
 um
 the
 way
 that
 and


kudos
 to
 the
 um
 awesome
 soul
 the
 the
 the


gentleman
 that
 uh
 open
 sourced
 the
 3D.


So
 I
 got
 it
 from
 Sketch
 Fab
 and
 he


didn't
 design
 this
 for
 creating
 a
 game


or
 anything
 like
 that.
 So
 all
 of
 the


pieces
 were
 stuck
 together.
 It
 was


almost
 like
 you
 had
 3D
 printed
 it
 and


the
 pieces
 were
 stuck
 together
 with
 the


board.
 And
 so
 I
 obviously
 I
 want
 that


sweet
 animation
 that
 when
 the
 model


decides
 it
 moves
 the
 piece,
 right?
 Um


and
 so
 I
 had
 to
 ask
 a
 lot
 of
 questions


to
 other
 models
 about,
 hey,
 teach
 me


what's
 going
 on
 with
 this
 3D
 thing.
 How


do
 I
 how
 do
 I
 reason
 about
 it?
 And
 then


I
 would
 copy
 what
 another
 model
 tells
 me


and
 I
 would
 toss
 it
 into
 Vzero.
 So,
 uh,


another
 thing
 that
 you
 can
 do
 when
 you


get
 stuck
 is
 you
 you
 she
 she
 can't
 see


it
 here
 because
 it's
 only
 for
 me,
 but


there's
 a
 debug
 button.
 And
 what
 the


debug
 button
 says,
 I
 asked
 Bzero,
 "Hey,


give
 me
 debugging
 tools
 so
 that
 I
 can


visualize
 the
 mesh
 of
 the
 3D
 model.
 I


can
 visualize,
 I
 can
 turn
 the
 textures


on
 and
 off."
 And
 so
 the
 the
 AI
 itself


can
 help
 itself
 and
 can
 give
 you
 tools


to
 debug
 problems,
 which
 is
 kind
 of


meta,
 but
 try
 it.
 Try
 it
 and
 it's
 going


to
 work
 well
 for
 you.


>> Okay.
 So,
 you
 you
 ask
 an
 expert,
 which


is
 another
 model.
 I
 mean,
 find
 out
 the


right
 question
 to
 ask.
 Well,
 this
 has


been
 very
 fun.
 Thank
 you
 for
 showing
 us


a
 little
 bit
 behind
 the
 curtain
 of
 how


you
 use
 Vzero,
 all
 the
 new
 stuff,
 some


of
 the
 ways
 you
 use
 it
 in
 your
 personal


life
 and
 fun
 projects.
 We
 love
 to
 see


it.
 So,
 you
 have
 this
 new
 VZ.
 You
 have


this
 room
 full
 of
 people.
 What
 do
 you


want
 from
 them?
 What
 What
 can
 they
 do


for
 you?


>> I
 mean,
 get
 busy
 shipping.
 So,
 try
 it


out.
 Uh
 give
 us
 feedback.
 Uh
 we
 will
 fix


it
 as
 very
 very
 fast
 because
 we're
 going


to
 be
 dog
 eating
 our
 own
 dog
 food.
 Uh


and
 yeah
 share
 the
 things
 that
 you
 built


uh
 with
 Vzero.


>> Oh
 we
 have a
 question
 back
 here.
 Oh
 I


love
 it.


>> So
 I
 had
 a
 question.
 Thank
 you
 for


sharing
 like
 the
 feedback
 process
 how


you
 loop
 um
 in
 terms
 of
 like
 from


ideation
 to
 like
 production
 like
 during


that
 process
 do
 you
 do
 any
 like
 product


market
 fit?
 How
 do
 you
 validate
 that


what
 you're
 trying
 to
 build
 is
 actually


like
 useful
 or
 um
 impactful
 for
 like


your
 ecosystem?
 Yeah,
 super
 hot
 off
 the


presses
 new
 sort
 of
 mental
 model
 that


we've
 been
 using
 internally.
 There's
 a


customer
 zero
 and
 a
 customer
 one.


Customer
 zero,
 we
 like
 to
 to
 be


ourselves.


We
 uh
 it's
 like
 the
 Rick
 Rubin,
 the


confidence
 in
 our
 ability
 to
 know
 what's


good,
 whatever.
 Like
 we
 like
 our
 taste.


We
 we've
 been
 around
 the
 block
 for
 a


while.
 We
 want
 we
 have
 ideas
 of
 products


that
 we
 would
 like
 to
 see
 out
 there
 in


the
 in
 the
 universe.
 Uh
 but
 customer
 one


is
 also
 really
 important
 like
 a
 closed


design
 partner
 Claire
 Vo.


>> Oh


>> Claire
 Vzero
 and
 our
 Claire
 and
 our
 our


CPO
 are
 constantly
 texting.


>> We're
 on
 a
 text
 chain.


>> She
 she
 she
 texts
 bug
 reports.
 She
 texts


things
 she
 needs.
 So
 having
 that
 group


of
 design
 partners,
 enterprise


companies,
 individuals,
 community


members,
 people
 that
 slide
 into
 my
 XVMs.


So
 it's
 you
 always
 wanted
 that
 pressure


test
 of
 of
 the
 world.
 And
 for
 skills
 it


was
 that
 you
 know
 people
 telling
 us
 hey


like
 why
 does
 Opus
 4.5
 kind
 of
 know
 the


latest
 XJS
 but
 not
 really
 and
 how
 can
 we


embed
 your
 best
 practices.
 So
 that
 was


kind
 of
 like
 in
 in
 our
 backlog
 like
 we


were
 thinking
 about
 that
 problem
 for
 a


while
 but
 then
 it
 also
 became
 really


concrete.
 We
 were
 like
 okay
 how
 would
 we


go
 about
 distributing
 and
 discovering


the
 skills
 and
 so
 sort
 of
 the
 idea


became
 very
 complete
 and
 that's
 where
 a


tool
 like
 Vzero
 really
 helps
 you
 because


when
 you
 want
 to
 extract
 it
 out
 of
 your


mind
 you
 can
 just
 vero
 it
 and
 so
 pretty


much
 what
 you
 see
 today
 it
 started
 with


a
 like
 four
 or
 five
 vzero
 prompts
 in
 a


conversation
 with
 our
 VP
 of
 design
 who


then
 took
 it
 way
 further
 and
 made
 it


actually
 good
 and
 um
 and
 uh
 our
 our
 CTO


and
 our
 and
 our
 product
 leader.
 So
 you


mentioned
 about
 BMs,
 is
 there
 a


possibility
 of
 having
 React
 Native
 in


Visero?


>> So
 what
 you
 saw
 today
 is
 if
 you
 if
 you


if
 you
 pee
 the
 covers
 of
 how
 Vero
 is


built
 is
 built
 on
 a
 bunch
 of
 Verscell


infrastructure
 that
 you
 also
 all
 have


access
 to
 the
 the
 virtual
 machine
 that


we
 use
 to
 run
 that
 Nex.js
 preview
 is


called
 sandbox.
 So
 the
 Verscell
 sandbox


and
 it's
 a
 very
 powerful
 computer.
 In


fact,
 what's
 actually
 making
 agents


really
 capable
 is
 not
 that
 they're


perfect,
 is
 that
 they
 have
 a
 computer
 at


their
 disposal
 in
 order
 to
 solve
 every


any
 problem.
 So,
 the
 reason
 we
 showed


you
 a
 glimpse
 of
 how
 we
 work
 internally


with
 DZ.
 The
 reason
 DZero
 is
 so
 good
 at


data
 analysis
 is
 that
 it
 has
 a
 computer


where
 it
 can
 do
 research,
 it
 can
 write


Python
 code,
 it
 can
 run
 it,
 it
 can
 make


a
 look
 up
 to
 Snowflake,
 it
 can
 search


the
 web,
 it
 can
 come
 back,
 it
 can
 fix


it.
 It's
 like
 it's
 like
 a
 four
 or
 five


minute
 process,
 right?
 And
 so
 these


computers
 are
 very
 powerful
 general


purpose
 computers.
 You
 could
 imagine


them
 running
 React
 Native.
 You
 could


imagine
 them
 writing
 other
 programming


languages.
 They
 can
 obviously
 already


write
 Python
 and
 run
 it.
 And
 so
 the


sky's
 is
 the
 limit
 from
 that


perspective.


>> I
 have
 a
 question
 on
 that
 topic.
 Is


there
 going
 to
 be
 a
 point
 at
 which
 Vzero


is
 going
 to
 help
 you
 build
 those
 agents?


>> Oh,
 absolutely.
 So
 the
 main
 the
 main


idea
 of
 this
 chess
 thing,
 it's
 cute,
 but


I
 mentioned
 the
 word
 workflow.
 So
 it's


actually
 tricky
 for
 me
 to
 say
 this


program
 is
 going
 to
 run
 forever
 in
 the


presence
 of
 network
 or
 compute
 failures.


So
 in
 fact
 like
 uh
 you
 know
 we're
 doing


this
 live
 and
 just
 randomly
 came
 up
 with


the
 idea.
 The
 reason
 I
 had
 confidence


the
 demo
 was
 going
 to
 work
 is
 that
 if
 an


LLM
 provider
 is
 down
 or
 a
 function
 call


dies
 or
 times
 out
 or
 whatever
 the


workflow
 engine
 of
 our
 cell
 will
 say


we're
 doing
 live.
 We're
 going
 to
 try
 it


again
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 try
 it
 again


and
 we're
 going
 to
 try
 it
 again.
 What


we're
 going
 to
 help
 you
 do
 is
 create


those
 kind
 of
 workflows
 from
 within
 v


0ero.
 A
 lot
 of
 agents
 need
 that
 kind
 of


reliability.
 For
 example,
 you
 send
 a


message
 from
 Slack
 and
 you
 say
 at
 player


GBT
 go
 and
 spec
 out
 this
 PRD
 for
 me.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 called
 at
 chatp.
 It
 is


running
 on
 workflows
 and


>> yes,
 we
 didn't
 rehearse
 this.


>> Yeah.
 So
 we
 we
 do
 have
 we
 do
 have
 uh
 I
 I


feel
 the
 pain
 on
 on
 agents
 where
 um


workflows
 are
 really
 helpful
 because


they
 give
 you
 durable
 overtime


execution.
 You
 can
 retry
 things,
 things


can
 fail,
 you
 can
 do
 them
 sequentially,


you
 can
 do
 all
 sorts
 of
 things.
 And
 so
 I


do
 think
 the
 ability
 for
 you
 to
 build


that
 on
 the
 back
 end
 is
 very
 helpful
 for


even
 for
 applications
 that
 don't
 have


the
 same
 kind
 of
 UI
 that
 you
 would
 have


it


>> because
 some
 are
 some
 are
 very
 visual


and
 some
 are
 going
 to
 be
 more
 headless


like
 some
 are
 going
 to
 be
 background


agents
 that
 are
 doing
 work
 for
 you.
 In


fact,
 the
 world
 is
 excited
 about
 the


artists
 formerly
 known
 as
 Cladbot.
 Yeah.


>> Moldbot.
 I
 don't know
 what
 moldbot


means,
 by
 the
 way.


>> Well,
 uh,
 crustaceians,
 this
 is
 how
 you


know
 you
 have
 kids
 in
 like
 elementary


schools.
 crustaceians
 like
 lose
 their


shell
 so
 they
 mold.


>> Moles
 are
 right.


>> It's
 like
 a
 snake.


>> Yeah,
 got
 it.


>> And
 then
 emerge
 to
 steal
 your
 bank


account.


>> But
 so
 that's
 a
 beautiful
 example
 of
 the


background
 thing,
 right?
 Because
 you


text
 it
 and
 it
 does
 a
 bunch
 of
 stuff
 for


you
 and
 then
 it
 responds.
 So
 that
 that's


the
 kind
 of
 thing
 that
 we
 want
 you
 to
 be


able
 to
 build
 with
 Vzero
 where
 it's


going
 to
 use
 workflows.
 It
 might
 use


sandbox
 and
 it
 might
 be
 more
 I
 think


moldbot
 is
 like
 super
 general.
 It
 can
 do


anything
 and
 even
 hack
 your
 computer
 but


uh
 I
 I
 I
 expect
 a
 lot
 of
 really
 cool


agents
 to
 to
 work
 that
 way
 like
 you
 just


WhatsApp
 them
 and
 we'll
 we'll
 help
 you


build
 those
 with
 Vzero
 and


>> and
 the
 last
 thing
 I
 actually
 deployed


on
 Versell
 was
 my
 live
 moltbot


conversation.
 If
 you
 want
 to
 see


>> what
 it
 is
 terminal


>> I
 well
 I
 I
 shut
 the
 computer
 and
 walked


away.
 I
 did
 not
 enjoy
 my
 it
 was
 an


interesting
 experience.
 You
 can
 smash


that
 subscribe
 button
 if
 you
 want
 to


watch
 it.


>> But
 I
 did
 I
 did
 deploy
 to
 Verscell


>> a
 terminal
 view
 of
 my
 conversation
 with


Mulbot.
 So
 you
 can
 go
 it's
 like
 it's


called


>> confessions.


>> Yeah.
 Oh
 that's
 exactly
 what
 it
 is.


Yeah.
 It's
 real
 scary


>> app.


>> Great.
 Maybe
 one
 more
 question.


>> Oh
 wow.
 What
 an
 honor.
 First
 of
 all,


thank
 you
 so
 much
 uh
 for
 hosting
 the


event.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 the
 new


VZero.
 I
 I
 ship
 a
 lot
 with
 Vzero.
 My


co-founder
 is
 using
 Cursor
 and
 now
 we


have
 like
 a
 mutual
 compatibility.


>> We're
 so
 back.


>> Love
 it.


>> There
 you
 go.
 Um
 and
 so
 I
 wanted
 to
 um


again
 I'm
 also
 a
 Vzero
 ambassador.
 There


we
 go.
 Let's
 go.
 Um
 I
 wanted
 to
 ask
 two


questions.
 number
 one
 um
 a
 little
 bit


different
 but
 when
 do
 you
 think
 so
 VZero


has
 really
 democratized
 the
 ability
 to


go
 from
 prompt
 to
 UI
 UI
 that
 works
 uh


and
 UI
 that
 satisfies
 like
 the
 the
 the


prompt
 that
 the
 user
 created
 when
 do
 you


think
 that
 paradigm
 is
 going
 to
 happen


within
 consumer
 in
 Gen
 UI
 uh
 I
 see
 that


your
 team
 has
 been
 playing
 with
 a
 bunch


of
 different
 libraries
 different
 ways
 to


create
 that
 uh
 when
 do
 you
 think
 that


switch
 is
 happening
 and
 then
 the
 second


question
 when
 can
 I
 uh
 write
 a
 prompt


and
 then
 deploy
 to
 the
 app
 store.


>> Yeah.
 So
 on
 the
 on
 the
 first
 question,


sometimes
 you're
 going
 to
 want
 like
 a


flash
 v0ero.
 So
 we're
 playing
 with
 ideas


around
 generative
 UI
 where
 an
 agent


might
 decide
 to
 render
 something
 and


think
 of
 it
 as
 like
 spontaneously


creating
 an
 a
 the
 UI
 code
 and
 then


rendering
 it
 right
 away.
 You're
 not


actually
 creating
 a
 code
 and
 an


application
 and
 deploying
 it.
 You
 just


want
 to
 make
 it
 happen.
 So
 we're
 doing
 a


lot
 of
 research
 on
 like
 what
 would
 that


look
 like?
 So
 it's
 another
 tool
 that
 we


can
 give
 agents
 on
 the
 app
 store


question
 you've
 seen
 some
 of
 the
 stuff


that
 we've
 been
 doing
 with
 vzero
 iOS
 app


react
 native
 skills
 a
 long
 held
 dream
 of


ours
 has
 been
 to
 really
 democratize


pushing
 to
 the
 apps
 are
 like
 you
 would


push
 to
 the
 web
 and
 everything
 here
 is


like
 sort
 of
 using
 that
 same
 those
 same


ingredients
 uh
 reactbased
 deployment


platform
 just
 deploy
 with
 one
 press
 of
 a


button
 and
 whatnot.
 So,
 uh,
 yeah,
 don't


want
 to
 promise
 any
 timelines,
 but,
 uh,


definitely
 something
 we
 want
 to
 do.


>> Thank
 you.
 Thanks
 everybody.
