- My name is Jill Tarter,
and I'm officially retired,
and so my title is Emeritus
Director of SETI Research
at the SETI Institute.
And, of course, SETI's an
acronym that stands for
the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
- [Narrator] Chapter 1.
Origins of a Cosmic Detective.
- Well, I actually didn't do
a whole lot with electronics.
I did a lot more hunting and fishing
and camping with my dad.
And then where all of these
pictures in our photo albums
from when I was a kid
where I'll be standing there
in a beautifully starched little dress
with ruffled lace socks
and Mary Janes on my feet
holding up a big fish, right?
Because these were the
tensions in my life growing up.
My dad was an outdoorsman
and my mother had been involved
in the fashion industry and retail,
so she dressed me up
and then I went out and
went fishing with my dad.
So I had a great childhood though.
And maybe,
let's see,
I think I was about eight years old
and my dad said, "We have to have a talk."
Clearly my mother had talked
to him the night before,
and so we had this washing machine talk,
when my dad and I wanted to talk,
he'd set me up on top of a washing machine
so that we'd be eye to eye.
And he said, you know,
"Your mom thinks that you're getting older
and you should be spending
more time doing girl things
rather than spending time
with me," and I just exploded.
I mean, you couldn't have said anything
that would've made me angrier.
I said, "That's not fair.
Why can't I do both?
It's just ridiculous.
You shouldn't have to
choose one or the other."
And, you know, of course,
then I started to cry
'cause at eight years old,
I knew if you wanted your
dad on your side, right,
the tears always help.
And so we continued this
conversation for a long time
and he finally said, "Okay, all right,
if you're willing to work really hard,
then you can do anything you wanna do."
And I said, "Okay, I'm
gonna be an engineer."
Now, I don't really think
I knew what engineers did,
but I knew my dad had a lot of friends,
now friends who were engineers
and they seemed to have happy lives.
So I said, "Okay, I'm
gonna be an engineer."
Then sadly, my dad died
a couple of years later
and I learned a really important lesson,
which is the carpe diem lesson
that most people end up
learning a bit later in life.
But, you know, I always thought
my dad was gonna be there
and if I didn't ask
him the question today,
I could ask him the question tomorrow.
Well, it doesn't always work that way.
And then I had told my dad
I was gonna be an engineer,
and then I just got stubborn about it
and I said, "Okay, I'm
gonna be an engineer."
And so I went through
five years of engineering
school at Cornell
and got an engineering degree.
I got a really good
education in problem solving,
but it turns out
I didn't really like
the engineering so much.
And in addition, I looked around
when I was thinking about
graduate school and I said,
"Hmm, if in general,
engineers are as boring as my professors,
I'm gonna find some
other problems to work on
with these great skills
that I've acquired."
And so then I started taking
all kinds of different
courses in graduate school
and ended up taking a
course from Edwin Salpeter
on the star formation and
the lifecycle of stars,
and I was just hooked.
I thought, stars live and die, right?
I thought that was amazing,
to be able to study the
lifecycle of a star.
And so that's what put
me into astrophysics.
I just had a lot of fortunate,
lucky circumstances.
I usually describe myself
as the chief cheerleader
for all things having to do
with searching for life beyond Earth.
And we have different ways of doing that.
Astrobiologists look for
what they call biosignatures,
trying to discern some
disequilibrium chemistry
in the atmospheres of
planets orbiting other stars.
And in my case, teams
that I've worked with
looked for technosignatures.
They look for evidence that someone
or something out there
has developed a technology
and that we might be able
to detect that technology
even over the vast
distances between the stars.
And we've been doing this for a while now,
and I've been cheerleading all the way
and I don't intend to stop anytime soon.
When I was about eight years old,
I was down in the Florida
Keys, the West Coast of Florida
with my aunt and uncle who
were literally beachcombers.
And my dad was there and he
was the center of my universe.
And I remember one night walking
along the edge of the gulf
holding my dad's hand
and looking up in the sky
and seeing these magnificent stars
because it was a very dark site.
There were no streetlights back then.
And I just had this idea
that on some planet
around one of those stars,
there would be a creature walking
along the edge of an ocean
with their parent looking up
and seeing our sun as a star in their sky.
And I know what set of circumstances
led me to have that particular worldview,
but it's been with me for a long time.
And then I did an engineering
undergraduate degree
and a PhD in astrophysics
and was nowhere near SETI
until a very happy accident happened.
My first year in graduate school,
UC Berkeley acquired the
first real desktop computer
that had ever been
manufactured, the PDP-8/S.
And it had no language.
You had to program the 11
things that it could do
by setting all the ones and zeros.
We had to program it NODIL.
And I learned to do that.
It's kind of a weird skill,
but I learned to do that my
first year in graduate school.
And much, much later as I
was finally getting ready
to finish my graduate degree,
that piece of equipment,
that computer was obsolete
and it was given to an x-ray astronomer
by the name of Stuart Bowyer,
who had been following NASA's workshops
on looking for life beyond the Earth.
And he said, "Wow,
UC Berkeley has a radio
astronomy telescope, right,
that's up at Hat Creek?"
And my friend Jack Welch runs that.
And so he figured out a way
that we could take the data in
parallel with the astronomers
and we could analyze it,
or that Stu could analyze
it, looking for signals
that were engineered as
opposed to astrophysical.
That's a great idea. But he had no money.
And so he went begging
and someone gave him this
old computer and he said,
"What the heck do I do with that?"
And somebody said, "Ah, Jill's still here.
Ah, she used to program that thing."
And so he came and recruited
me to work on his SETI project,
which was called SERENDIP
at Hat Creek Observatory.
And I programmed that PDP-8
to be the processing
engine for that search.
So it was just a delightful accident.
And, of course, then I
went off to do a postdoc
at NASA Ames, ran into John Billingham
who was starting up the,
what did he call it,
the Interstellar Communication
Committee at NASA Ames.
And I said, "Hey John,
there are more than 40 hours in a week
and I'd like to volunteer with your group
and see what you're
doing," and so that was it.
I've never had any other job
except thinking about life beyond Earth.
I mean, I never set out to
have this as a career path,
but I can't think of anything
more exciting to work on.
And there I was in the right place
with the right set of skills,
engineering and astrophysics,
and we were off to the races.
First of all, being a woman
was the first part of it,
which meant that at Cornell
as a freshman in the dormitories,
I was locked in at 10 o'clock at night
and they didn't open the doors
until six in the morning,
which meant that I was
sitting there by myself
while all my male colleagues
were over in their dorms
or in restaurants or bars or something,
doing all the problem sets as a group,
you know, you take the evens,
I'll take the odds kind of thing.
But I didn't have that
because I was locked in
and working on my own.
So I got a better education, technically.
It didn't do me very well socially, right?
I was a bit socially awkward.
And then there were all kinds of
interesting situations in the classroom.
First of all,
all the professors knew
me 'cause I was singular.
I was sitting there in
this sea of male faces.
They didn't know most
of the male students,
at least not early on.
So if people wanted an
extension on an assignment,
they'd send me to go
ask for the extension.
And that was a little awkward,
but I did get to know my
professors a little bit better.
And, you know, there was the day
when I was asked not to come
to my nuclear physics class the next day
because they were going to
discuss the dangers of radiation
and male sterility
and they just couldn't
do that in my presence.
And I went, what about female
sterility? Come on guys.
Oh,
things like, I think I told Sarah Scoles
first year engineering
problems and methods,
a required course,
everybody had to take it,
a lecture room with 300 people,
and I was an only child.
My mother was very protective of me
as she sent me off to Cornell.
And so just the way she used to do
when she sent me off to
camp as a younger person,
she sewed little name tags "Jill Cornell"
into all of my clothes,
and in particular onto
a label of a sweater
that I had thrown over my shoulders.
And then I flipped it off
over the back of my seat
and suddenly we hear this
little ripple of tittering
and laughter going back from me
towards the back of the auditorium
and then down the other side.
And finally, the professor
stopped his lecture
and he said, "What's going on?"
Thanks, mom.
The label in the sweater
had originally said
100% virgin wool,
but my mother put my name
tape over the word wool.
And so they all then knew
that I was 100% virgin.
It was one of those moments
where you just hope
the floor would open up
and swallow you whole,
but of course it didn't
and you got through it and got
some laughs out of it later.
It was a little...
I got good grades
'cause I'm locked in my
dorm room working by myself.
And so there was a lot of tension
because my grades were better
than many of my other
colleagues or students.
And then in my junior year,
I made a decision that
I was gonna get married
to the man who had been my lab instructor
from my freshman physics class.
And he was in graduate school
and we knew that I was
gonna go to graduate school
and we sat down and we worked
out all of our finances
and we said we could do this,
we could make this happen,
partially because I was
on a full scholarship
from Procter & Gamble,
one of those is given each
year in the engineering school
and one is given in the arts school.
And I had the engineering
scholarship and it was fantastic.
Tuition fees, books, all
of that kind of thing.
And so we obviously counted on that.
But when Procter & Gamble found out
that I was planning on getting married
at the end of my junior year,
they took the scholarship away.
They said, "You're not serious.
You're not gonna be a scientist.
You know, we're not gonna waste
this money on educating you
just to go be a housewife
and have babies."
Ugh, wow, that was a devastating blow.
So I went to the dean of
the engineering college,
his name was Dale Corson,
and who later became president
of Cornell University.
And I said, "Dean Corson, this isn't fair.
I mean, I've been on
dean's list every semester.
I'm a good student and
I intend to continue
to be a student and a graduate student
and a scientist or engineer."
And he looked at me and he kindly said,
"You know, you're right.
It isn't fair. It isn't fair at all."
And I have no idea what
he said when he called up
the folks at Procter & Gamble,
but he got my scholarship back for me.
It was wonderful, you know,
and I thanked him profusely at that point.
And then 20 years later when
he was president of Cornell
and had an advisory
committee to help him decide
how to run the Arecibo
telescope in Puerto Rico,
which sadly we've just
lost now, it's collapsed,
but back then, I was on
that advisory committee.
And so I was able to come up
to him all those years later
and say, "See, President Corson,
thank you for believing in me.
I didn't just drop out and
become a housewife and have kids.
You know, I'm on your advisory committee
for this fantastic telescope
and I have to thank you once again,"
and that felt so good.
It felt wonderful to be able to tell him
that he'd made such a
difference in my life.
Over my career, I've been
able to watch the universe
appear to become more bio-friendly.
We don't know that it is,
that's what we're trying to find out.
But over my career, we
have discovered planets
around other stars, exoplanets.
When we started,
we only knew about nine
in our solar system.
And then we demoted one of those.
But now we know that in
the Milky Way Galaxy,
there are more planets
than there are stars.
And additionally, we
now know about organisms
that we call extremophiles,
forms of life, not just microscopic,
but a lot of them macroscopic,
living in environments
which when I was a student, I
was taught utterly no chance.
That's gonna be sterile.
No reason to look for life there.
But, of course, life is
there and it's amazing.
So exoplanets and extremophiles, right,
two big game changers.
And now it makes it just seem
natural to ask the question.
Well, with all that potentially habitable
real estate out there,
is any of it actually inhabited?
And so that's just the most natural thing
now that we have a different
worldview of our cosmos
than we did 40 years ago.
And so I'm excited.
We have a real opportunity in
this century to answer that
"are any of them inhabited" question.
And so I find that really exciting.
It makes me mad to be old
because I probably am not
going to be around long enough
to see the end of that story
or the beginning of the
next phase of our searching.
But young people, graduate students now
are going to have a really exciting
way forward in this century.
SETI could succeed tomorrow,
but the instruments that are needed
for finding disequilibrium chemistry
in the atmospheres of exoplanets,
those are gonna take a while to build.
And then it's gonna
take another generation
to be big enough to actually do the job.
For me, the fun part was getting
started with this, right?
Helping to, you know, roll this
rock up the mountain, right?
So I've had the privilege
of being in at the beginning,
and because I'm a big
frog in a small pond,
I've had the opportunity to decide
a lot of different things
about what we should do.
And you don't get out of
bed in the morning saying,
ah, you know, today, I'm
gonna get a signal today,
because you're probably
gonna go to bed disappointed.
But you do get out of bed
in the morning saying,
ah, today, I'm gonna figure
out how to do this better.
We're gonna do something that
we couldn't do last week.
We're gonna figure out
how we can do it today
and then how we can do
it better next week.
And so that's really satisfying.
And I've known all along in this business
that I'm probably gonna
have to train my replacement
because this is not a small
task that we're undertaking.
This is a really large search,
and our tools for doing the search
are getting better all the time
and now exponentially faster
because computing is improving so rapidly.
So didn't go into this thinking that,
well, you know, it'll
be a good thing to do
for the first five years of my career
and then I'll find something else to do.
Now, I've pretty much
understood from the beginning
and everybody who works on
this program understands
that we are probably in
this for the long haul.
And so we try and find ways to reach out
to young engineers and students
and excite them about the potential
of doing this kind of work.
It's not everybody's cup of tea, right?
People sometimes approach
their science as,
I'm gonna do something,
I'm gonna publish a paper,
I'm gonna do something else,
I'm gonna publish a paper,
and I'm gonna be successful
all along the way.
And sometimes they're
wise enough to think,
and I'll do something wrong
and I'll learn from that,
but this idea of working on something
that might not succeed during
your career is a little dicey
and it takes a certain kind of personality
to be eager to do that.
And then, of course,
there's the other shoe,
which is the funding for this activity
is anything but stable.
And so not only do I have
to say, "Come join us,"
no, you might not succeed
with finding a signal in your career,
and hmm, maybe I can't make
salary next month, right?
So that's another challenge we'd like to,
now in my cheerleading role,
I'd like to work on
establishing an endowment
so that this kind of activity,
this scientific exploration
can be funded stably into the future
because that's what it's
probably gonna take.
- [Narrator] Chapter 2: SETI
The Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
- SETI, the acronym
is the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence.
But that's actually a misnomer.
We don't know how to define intelligence.
We certainly don't know how
to detect it at a distance.
What we can perhaps do
is find evidence of
someone else's technology
that is detectable over
these vast distances
between the stars.
So we should actually call it SETT,
but SETI's has been around for a while
and has brand recognition
and we're not changing that anytime soon,
but we are looking for
evidence of technologies.
And there are a couple of things
that we've done in the past
and new things that we're
gonna be trying to do
in the future.
We've been looking for
electromagnetic radiation, signals,
either at radio wavelengths
or at optical wavelengths.
But we're specifically looking
for the kinds of signals
that as far as we know,
nature can't produce,
but our technologies do it all the time.
So in the radio part of the spectrum,
and that means that we're looking
for frequency compression,
for power that shows up
at exactly one channel on the radio dial.
It isn't spread out over many channels,
which is what nature would
do, but it's a single channel.
And in the optical, we
look for time compression.
We look for bright pulses
that last for a nanosecond
or a microsecond.
And again, this is something
that as far as we know
nature can't do, but lasers sure can.
And so we build instrumentation
to put behind radio telescopes
or optical telescopes
that split the incoming signal,
which is voltage is a function of time,
split it up into many,
many different channels,
or we sample the optical
telescope very, very, very quickly
so we can detect these
compressions in frequency.
We can see a signal that
shows up at one frequency
and it may over time change its frequency
because the Earth is rotating
and there's a Doppler shift
between the transmitter and the receiver.
And because of the rotation,
there's also a Doppler drift
and the frequency changes.
So we write software
that's looking for those
particular patterns,
and likewise in the optical.
We look for bright flashes
that show up only at one point
and then may not show up again.
So you have to be very
careful in this kind of work
about deciding whether or
not what you have detected,
what shows up in your data,
is actually real, coming from the sky,
moving the way the stars move on the sky
at what we call sidereal rate,
or whether what you're
finding in your data
is coming from your own equipment,
noise that you generate,
or that satellites orbiting
the Earth generate.
And so we have this problem of deciding
whether what we've detected is us or them.
And over time, that gets to
be more and more problematic
as there are more satellites orbiting,
which not only make the night
sky bright with flashes,
but make it very loud in the radio
because of the transmissions
from those satellites.
And so we've had to try and
get clever over the years
and we certainly spend
a good half of our computing resources
trying to discriminate
between us and them.
And I've long thought that
the best way to do this
is in the radio to use two telescopes,
that are separated by
hundreds of kilometers,
sometimes even 1,000 kilometers,
and they're both looking at the same place
on the sky simultaneously.
And then if you find a signal
in your primary telescope,
you look at the data from
the secondary telescope
and you look to see if
that signal is also found
by the other telescope
with the appropriate shift
in frequency and drift
that would be due to
the differential Doppler
of the Earth's rotation.
And then in the optical,
because we're looking for single events,
you know, a single bright pulse,
you also want to use multiple telescopes
and you want to use the simultaneity
with the light travel time
between the telescopes taken into account.
You want to use that
simultaneous detection
as your verification
that this is something
that's really coming from the sky.
And now we're on a threshold
where we can begin to think
about using artificial intelligence
to help us with this search.
So in my searches,
we have done our signal detection
always in near real time
so that as soon as we have something,
we can immediately follow up on it.
This has turned out to be
one of the best discriminants
against interference for us.
But now what we want to do is use,
instead of saying,
is there this particular narrow
band pattern in the data,
now we wanna use machine intelligence
to look at the data in
a bias-free way and say,
not is there this pattern,
but is there any pattern?
Is there anything other
than noise in these data?
And that will open up the search
to all kinds of different
modulation schemes
that we have very little
sensitivity to at the moment.
By displaying the data
as frequency versus time,
as a two-dimensional image,
then we can use all of
these wonderful techniques
that are being developed
for artificial intelligence,
for image recognition.
And I think that's going to open up
a lot of new channels for
SETI research in the future.
Because we're interested in ourselves,
we're infinitely interested
in humans, right?
And we want to know how we
stack up against the cosmos.
Are we unique?
Are we one of many?
And if we're one of many,
how intelligent are we
relative to somebody else
or something else out there?
You know, in terms of technology,
we can't find anybody out there
whose technology is
less advanced than ours,
but it's quite probable
that what we do detect
will be technology
that is significantly
more advanced than ours.
Most of the stars in our
part of the Milky Way Galaxy
are about a billion
years older than the sun.
So there could be technologies out there
that have a large headstart.
And for me,
the real reason to work on this question
is to know whether it's possible for us
to have a long future.
Right?
There are so many challenges
on this planet today
that would indicate that maybe,
maybe our future is not very long
because of mistakes that we have made
in terms of living on this planet
in a sustainable manner.
However,
if we detect a signal,
then we know it is possible
to have a long future.
And the reason is statistical, right?
We are not going to
succeed in this project
unless on average any technology out there
is very long lived.
And that's not long in human times,
it's long in cosmic time.
So a successful detection
means that it's possible
to have a long future as a
technological civilization.
And I think that that's
really worth going after.
I don't expect them to solve our problems,
but I do expect if we
succeed to be inspired
by knowing that somebody
else made it through
this technological
adolescence, and we can too.
We simply have to find a way.
But we know there's an answer.
And that's inspiring for me.
When we used to ask the question,
are we alone in the universe?
We used to ask the priests
and the philosophers
or anybody else we thought was smart,
we used to ask them
what should we believe?
But that's the wrong verb, right?
There is an answer to that question,
but what any of us believe
isn't going to change
the way the universe is.
And so the appropriate thing
is to do a scientific exploration
to go and try and find out what is.
So we've gone from belief
to scientific exploration
over the past 400
or actually much longer ago in
terms of asking the question.
And I think that's the right trajectory.
This is an appropriate
question to be tackled
by scientific exploration in
a very systematic fashion.
Let's approach that by
thinking about something
that Stephen Hawking once said.
He wasn't eager to have
extraterrestrials find us
because using the analogy
to Columbus' discovery of the new world,
Stephen said it didn't work out very well
for the inhabitants when Columbus
discovered the new world.
Well, for me,
I think there might be
another answer, right?
First of all, we're talking
about them coming here,
which means that they have technologies
that we haven't yet developed, right?
And that means that
they're older than we are.
And I wonder how you can become
an old technological civilization
unless you outgrow the bad
behavior and the aggressiveness
that probably helped
you evolve intelligence
in the first place?
So I'm in the kind of Steven Pinker,
kinder and gentler, better
nature of ourselves school.
And I think that cultural evolution
when it begins to take hold
will drive a civilization
to a kinder and gentler end.
Steven takes 900 pages
to say that that's actually
happening here, right?
We are kinder and gentler
now than we have ever been.
And to the extent that
we work on this project,
SETI, and we talk to your
mother or other people out there
and tell them what we're doing,
I think it actually has to change
their perspective a little bit.
They have to stop thinking of themselves
as just a Californian, an American.
I think SETI holds up a mirror
to all the people on the planet
and says to them,
"Look, you look, in that mirror,
you are all the same
when compared to something,
someone else out there
that evolved orbiting a different star."
And I think that that sameness,
that understanding that
we are all earthlings
is incredibly important
because these challenges
that face the planet
which are undeniable
and which we have to find remedies for,
these challenges don't
respect national boundaries.
And we're going to have to
find global solutions to them.
And so I think if we can
shift our perspective
to thinking about ourselves as earthlings,
then that has got to be beneficial
to finding a way to work
together across the planet
to come up with solutions
to these problems
that are very real.
So that cosmic perspective
is something that I'm eager to talk about,
and I think SETI gives me
an opportunity to do that.
And if you think about
the chairman of the
astrobiology department
at Columbia University,
his name is Caleb Scharf,
and Caleb has a wonderful
way of stating this.
He says that on a finite world,
that's us, we're on this Earth,
on a finite world,
a cosmic perspective is a
necessity and not a luxury.
So to the extent that doing SETI
can help us open people's minds,
change their perspective,
I think it will help us
get to a long future.
So the Allen Telescope Array
is a collection of 42
six-meter radio telescopes.
We had hoped it would be 350,
but there was so much technology
that we had to work out
in order to build this array
as a large number of small dishes
the first time ever that
we ran out of money.
And 42, well, life, the
universe, and everything,
that's a pretty good place to stop.
And the telescopes are built
so that they can simultaneously
do radio astronomy and SETI observations.
Because the telescopes are small,
they look at a large
field of view on the sky,
big patch of the sky at the same time.
And so in that large patch of sky,
there are likely to be objects,
such as molecular clouds
or supernova remnants
or pulsars or quasars,
that radio astronomers
would like to study.
At the same time, we're
collecting data for SETI.
And the question of
using radio wavelengths
versus optical wavelengths
versus infrared wavelengths
has a lot to do with how
those waves pass through
the great distances between the stars.
Now, we think of space being a vacuum,
but indeed, it's filled with
some molecular gas and dust.
And when you get to be a size,
a wavelength is approximately the size
of one of those little
pieces of dust grain,
then that wavelength is
heavily absorbed and scattered.
That's why at optical wavelengths,
these short wavelengths like
the size of a grain of dust,
we've never seen the center
of our galaxy in the optical
because that radiation
gets absorbed, scattered.
But when you get to longer
wavelengths into the infrared
and then particularly much
longer wavelengths in the radio,
they essentially don't
see the dust at all.
So we can see vastly farther
through our galaxy in the infrared
and in the radio,
which is why we think that
those wavelengths make sense
for someone who is either deliberately
trying to create a signal
to attract our attention
or is using technologies
that might very well leak
or emit radio or infrared wavelengths.
If it's warm, it's gonna
glow in the infrared.
So we just think that this is a good idea.
We'd like to look,
obviously, what we'd like
to do is look at all the sky
all the time at all frequencies.
If you could do that, that
would be the best way to,
oh, and with more than one telescope,
that would be the best way
to find transient signals
that last for only a short period of time.
But we can't do that yet.
We're beginning to be able
to do it in the optical.
So yes, our range,
how far the signal can go
through the interstellar medium,
will be more limited.
But indeed, the technologies that allow us
to actually look at all
the sky all the time
have developed there
rather than in the radio,
but all the sky all the
time all frequencies,
that's the goal,
and we'll see where technology takes us.
The Hat Creek Radio Observatory
where we built the Allen Telescope Array
has been run by the University
of California at Berkeley
since the 1960s.
And it just had a series
of different types of telescope there.
Originally, just a very large 85 foot dish
for doing centimeter
wavelength observations
and then an array of dishes for working
at shorter radio wavelengths
in the millimeter.
And now the Allen Telescope Array is there
and it's, you know,
it's really kind of nice
to have your own telescope
so that you can look at the sky 24/7.
And indeed, in radio wavelengths you can.
The sun is not a bright radio source.
So as opposed to our optical counterparts
who have to wait until it's dark,
we can observe 24 hours a day.
Having that facility
and having the really
bright folks at UC Berkeley
and the SETI Institute
be able to develop this new technology,
which we could not have
done much before we did it
because it takes so much computing
to combine all of the outputs
of those small telescopes
together in real time,
it's been a fantastic opportunity
to pioneer a new way of
building radio telescopes.
And now if you look at the plans
for international projects like
the Square Kilometre Array,
which will be built in South
Africa and Western Australia,
you can see that those
telescopes are all built now
as a large number of small dishes.
So we actually did something
pretty spectacular,
proving out this technology.
My husband, Jack Welch,
who's the gentleman
who discovered water in
the interstellar medium,
we had an airplane that we used to fly
from our home in Berkeley, California
to Northern California
to the Allen Telescope
Array up near Mount Lassen.
And on one of these flights,
we were actually returning
to the Bay Area at night
and we're flying along
and we're actually under positive control,
we're talking to the ground
and they're following us,
and suddenly at two o'clock position,
there's this bright light,
amazing bright light,
and we look at each other
and we talk to the ground
and we say, "What's at
our two o'clock position?"
And they say, "There's
nothing on the radar,"
and yet we see this thing.
And it was the most confusing feeling.
You say, "Oh, a UFO? Really?"
Not me. I'm the most skeptical
person around, right?
How can this be happening?"
And it was, oh, it was weird.
It was really weird for a
good three or four minutes
we're staring at this.
And then suddenly the clouds,
which we hadn't appreciated were there,
the clouds broke apart a little more
and we got to see the moon
that was shining through
a hole in the clouds.
So I've had a UFO experience,
but it became an explained
object fairly quickly.
And yet I know this
unsettling, confusing feeling
when you're seeing something,
you don't understand it,
you can't explain it,
and hopefully you'll be
lucky the way we were
and come up with an explanation
because certainly didn't
have anything to do
with extraterrestrials or little green men
or flying saucers.
It was really confusing
looking at something,
understanding that I
really, because it was dark
and there was no reference frame,
I couldn't really tell how big
it was, how far away it was,
but it sure as heck was there.
And then I thought, "Oh, you
know, I've been telling people
for years to bring me data,
to bring me something
that I can investigate
with respect to their claims of UFOs.
Let's get some data."
And here I am thinking, well,
I can take a picture of that,
but that's not gonna do very much good
'cause there's no reference.
And besides, the ground
control is telling me
that there's nothing in the sky
on their radar at that position.
And so it was just, this
can't be happening to me,
that was my feeling,
and how am I going to
explain this to someone
and tell them what I experienced?
But fortunately, we were
able to keep watching
and come up with an explanation.
The moon shining through
a hole in the clouds.
Over the years, we've certainly had
a number of false positives.
Most of them, we can explain very quickly.
But there was a time where I was in,
I was observing at the National
Radio Astronomy Observatory
in Green Bank, West Virginia,
I think it was in 1998.
And our second telescope
was in Woodbury, Georgia.
And that telescope took a hit by lightning
and that fried a disk drive.
And it took FedEx a couple of
days to get a new disk drive
into this very rural area of Georgia.
But we were at NRAO, we still
had that telescope time,
we'd actually rented it.
This was back before we could
build our own telescope,
and we weren't gonna waste it,
so we continued observing
and instead of having a second telescope
to validate the detection,
what we did is we pointed our telescope
in West Virginia at a star.
And then we'd take data
and then we'd point it off the star
and take data
and go back on the star
and then off the star
and then on the star,
this is a standard radio astronomy
technique called nodding.
And an interesting signal
would be one that was there
whenever we looked at the star,
but was absent when we looked
in any other direction.
And so early one morning, about
five o'clock in the morning,
I started tracking this one target.
And lo and behold, there
was clearly a signal.
Now, we do our signal
processing in near real time,
so that we can in fact do
the follow-up necessary
to try and distinguish
between interference.
And in our two-dimensional
display of the data
with frequency being
on the horizontal axis
and time being on the vertical axis,
what I saw was a series of signals
that looked like a picket fence.
So multiple signals
and the frequency spacing
between each signal
was the same from one to the next.
Well, that's not mother nature.
That's pretty clearly
an interesting signal.
And so I started this nodding,
and indeed, every time
we moved the telescope,
the signal went away and we
came back and it was there.
And I thought, oh, hmm.
I had a very clever thought,
although I was very excited
and there was a lot of adrenaline
going on at this point.
Anyway, I thought I'll write a program
and I'll ask this program
to look at all the data
we've collected here
at the telescope in the
last couple of weeks
and see if we've ever seen a signal
with that constant frequency spacing
coming from some other
direction on the sky,
not the direction of this star.
And I wrote the program
and I was so excited.
I was pretty sloppy
and so I didn't format
the output very well.
And when I looked at the output,
I missed the fact that indeed,
we had seen that signal
a couple of times before
from different directions on the sky.
And so now I got really excited
and I called the dorm
and woke up my colleague
John Drayer and he came down
and we just stayed on that star all day
until it set in the west
and we couldn't figure out
right away what it was.
But by the time the sun
had set, the star had set,
we knew that the signal
wasn't coming from the star
because the rate at which
the frequencies were changing
was appropriate to a
source that was rising up
to the zenith, not one that
was setting in the west.
So we knew that it was something else
and it took us a while to
figure out what it was.
And it was, in fact, when
you have a telescope,
it's like the telescope
has peripheral vision.
It has what we call side lobes.
So I can still see my fingers out here,
although I'm looking straight ahead,
and a radio telescope is like that.
And this particular
telescope had a side lobe
that was very weak
at exactly 90 degrees
away from the boresight,
the pointing direction.
And what was happening
was the SOHO spacecraft,
which was orbiting the sun, not the Earth,
in orbit around the sun, was
getting into that side lobe.
And every time we moved
the telescope in a different direction,
it fell out of that side lobe.
I was a little disappointed
when we quit tracking that
star and went off for dinner.
But actually, the worst thing was
that we had told our colleagues
back in Mountain View what we were doing
because we had an identical setup there
and so they could see the
data that was being collected.
And we went off to
dinner, convinced that no,
this wasn't really what
we had hoped it would be.
And I forgot to call the
folks in Mountain View
and say, "Sorry, no deal."
So they stayed up until
two o'clock in the morning
at California when that
source would rise again
because they were sure
we were gonna track it,
continue tracking it.
And so I had some fences to
mend when I got home, right,
for not being thoughtful
enough to let them know
that this was not it.
Carl Sagan is not only a good astronomer,
but he was a spectacular communicator.
And he has the ability
to talk to an audience about astronomy,
and in particular,
his interest in trying to
find life beyond Earth.
And he was just really compelling.
So it's quite appropriate
that Lisa Kaltenegger
at Cornell University
operates something called
the Carl Sagan Center
for the Study of Life in the Universe.
Well, Carl wrote,
along with Joseph Shklovsky
of the Soviet Union,
the first real book about modern SETI.
It was called "Intelligent
Life in the Universe," I think.
And that book really did energize
lots of students and
scientists and engineers
about the possibility of
actually conducting a search.
And it was the first time
that at a popular level,
there had been a scientific
discussion of this idea.
So he is early into this game
of thinking about life beyond Earth.
And he communicated the
excitement of that idea
and the fact that indeed,
in the 20th century,
we actually had some tools
to be able to launch a
systematic scientific exploration
to try and answer this question.
So he was very, very influential.
And, of course, cosmos talked
to the majesty of the universe
and really resonated with the public.
Carl was an absolutely
brilliant communicator,
and we miss him.
Absolutely.
There have been others
that have come after him,
but no one individual
that still has the impact that he had.
He would go out and
lecture at a university
and he would have students
come up to him and say,
"Cosmos, that's what made me a scientist.
That's what inspired me
to become a scientist."
I get a little of that today
because of "Contact," which
is now over 20 years old.
And particularly young
women will come up and say,
"Contact, that was my favorite movie,
and it inspired me to become a scientist."
So it's gratifying.
But I sure miss Carl.
I was back visiting
Cornell for some symposium
and Carl said, "Come on
up to the house tonight,
we're having a cocktail
party," and so I did.
That was always fun.
And when I got there,
Ann Druyan, Carl's wife,
and Carl took me off to the corner
and Ann said,
"Carl's writing a science fiction book."
And said I, "Yeah, I know.
The New York Times told us last weekend
what kind of an advance he got for this
and we're all jealous as hell, right?"
And Annie chuckled and she
said, "Well," she said,
"I think you might recognize
one of the characters,
but I think you're gonna like her."
And so I said, "Oh, come on, Ann, look,
just make sure that Carl doesn't
have this female character
eat ice cream cones for lunch
and then nobody's gonna
think it's me, right?
Nobody will be confused."
That story is because we were over
at NASA Ames Research Center
and there was no good food,
but we could walk at lunchtime
over to a Baskin-Robbins
and get ice cream for lunch.
I got teased a lot about
that over the years.
But
indeed,
Carl sent me a pre-publication
copy of the book "Contact"
and I was going, "Wait, wait!
Carl doesn't know this about me.
How did he, how, how?"
And it turns out that
when I was a fresh PhD,
I got invited to a meeting in Washington
and I walked into a room of 80 female PhDs
in all kinds of STEM fields,
a life-changing experience for me.
I had never walked into
a room full of women,
very comfortable walking
into a room full of men
as the only woman,
but never a room full of women
who were so smart and bright.
And we did a little bit
of amateur demographics
and it turned out that many of those women
had their fathers die when
they were young, just like me.
Many of those women were competitive.
And this was pre-Title IX,
so there were no women sports teams
that you could try out for.
The only thing you could
try out and compete at
was baton twirling or cheerleading.
And so an overwhelming number of the women
had been drum majorettes or cheerleaders
in their high school years.
I was a drum majorette.
The T-Bird, which is a 54 T-Bird,
was America's first real sports car.
I was in love with that
and the character is as well in "Contact."
It turns out that I told
Carl about this meeting
and we'd written a little report
and I sent him the report.
And I'm just very prototypical
of all those women.
And so Carl got many of these
anecdotes or traits or characteristics
out of that report I sent him.
And because I'm so prototypical,
I even thought it was me.
I'm often introduced as being the woman
who was the inspiration for Ellie Arroway
played by Jodie Foster
in the movie "Contact."
And I am in a little way,
but really that character
is an amalgamation
of traits of female scientists
that Carl had worked with.
And actually, I think the
character is Carl himself, right?
I think there's a lot of
Carl in that character.
Anyway, it was fun to
be able to work on a set
with Jodie Foster.
She's very, very brilliant.
She's also very kind.
And that was a great
privilege to work with her.
She told us that she was never gonna teach
anyone any science,
but she was interested in
the character of scientists.
Were we passionate? Were we supercilious?
Do we have big egos?
All this kind of thing.
And I think she did a grand
job with that character.
I'm sure that there's something
that we haven't quite thought of yet.
I'm sure there's physics and technology
that we haven't yet
understood or invented.
So I can imagine that in the future,
there will be other
technologies that may make sense
in terms of trying to
find life beyond Earth.
Certainly, we can look forward
to these new astronomical instruments,
very, very large telescopes,
ground-based and in orbit.
You know, we're now in the
era of 10 meter telescopes.
We're going into the era
of 30 meter telescopes.
And we can think and scratch our heads
about when these telescopes
make images of other planetary systems,
what might they see that
would be an indication
of someone else's technology?
Not just astrophysics,
but actually what kinds of technology
might these large optical
and infrared telescopes
be able to discover accidentally,
serendipitously, right?
I like to point out that there's
this wonderful star system,
called TRAPPIST-1,
it's a tiny little red dwarf star,
much fainter and smaller than our sun,
but it has in orbit around
it seven Earth-sized planets.
And so one Sunday above the
fold in the New York Times,
there's this beautiful artist conception
of these seven worlds
orbiting these tiny red star
and an artist had colored
them all different.
And they should all be different,
at least in terms of their temperature
because they're at different
distances away from their star.
But what if we finally get the ability
to image those seven worlds
and we find out that two
or three or four of them
are all the same when they shouldn't be.
But perhaps some advanced technology
has geo-engineered these planets
to turn it into the type of real estate
that they particularly prefer.
So I look forward to that kind of exciting
potentially serendipitous detection.
And in the radio, we're
building bigger telescopes,
like the Square Kilometre Array,
which will have more sensitivity
and be sensitive to fainter transmitters.
And then in the optical and the infrared,
we're building these telescopes
that can look at huge areas on the sky.
Something called PANOSETI,
something called LaserSETI.
And this is their first opportunity
to try and go towards that
all the sky all the time coverage
that will make us sensitive
to transient signals.
So I'm really excited,
and eventually, we may build
the Square Kilometre
Array in South Africa.
We may build the next
generation of VLA telescope
across the southwest of the United States.
And we may orbit large
optical telescopes, infrared telescopes
that will allow us to do these studies
of the atmospheres of distant exoplanets.
And so I think that the future is really
using astronomical instruments.
We're talking about the future
where some of these instruments
actually might be usable
for SETI in a commensal way,
not dedicated to SETI,
but we can use the data that they collect
perhaps to do some SETI explorations.
So I'm excited.
And, of course, as I said,
maybe what we should be looking
for are zeta rays, right?
Not radio or optical or
infrared, but zeta rays.
I don't know what a zeta ray is
because we haven't invented it yet.
But if we do in the future,
and if it makes sense,
then we should start looking
for other technologies using zeta rays.
In my opinion, and it's only an opinion,
I think we're too young
to start broadcasting.
Broadcasting is a difficult
and more expensive job,
and it does no good to
broadcast for 15 minutes,
for two years, for five years, right?
Because your signal is gonna go past
your intended recipient
in a few minutes, in a few years,
in five years, right?
If you're going to broadcast,
you need to start and not stop.
So that when another
emerging technology out there
begins to explore its universe
with tools that are appropriate
to detect your signal,
the signal will be there for them to find.
So I think we need to grow up first.
We need to become an old,
stable technological civilization.
And then we should take on
this hard job of broadcasting
and do it forever.
