From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Wednesday,
 February
 11th.
 Here's
 what


we're
 covering.


>> Um,
 like
 you,
 I
 am
 just
 learning
 about


the
 horror
 of
 the
 tragedy
 that
 unfolded


in
 Tumblr
 Ridge
 this
 evening.
 In
 a
 small


town
 in
 Western
 Canada,
 a
 shooter
 killed


nine
 people
 and
 injured
 25
 yesterday.


Most
 of
 those
 killed
 were
 at
 the
 town's


high
 school.
 Two
 others
 were
 found
 dead


at
 a
 home
 nearby.


>> An
 individual
 we
 understand
 is
 the


suspected
 shooter
 is
 believed
 to
 have


died
 of
 a
 self-inflicted
 gunshot
 wound.


>> The
 top
 government
 official
 in
 British


Columbia
 said
 there's
 still
 limited


information
 available
 about
 what


happened.
 The
 suspect
 was
 described
 in
 a


police
 alert
 as
 a
 female
 in
 a
 dress
 with


brown
 hair.
 Authorities
 declined
 to


provide
 an
 age
 and
 said
 they
 haven't


determined
 a
 motive.
 Tumblr
 Ridge,
 which


is
 surrounded
 by
 wilderness
 in
 the


foothills
 of
 the
 Rocky
 Mountains,
 only


has
 about
 2500
 residents
 and
 it's
 so


remote
 that
 one
 local
 woman
 told
 the


Times
 cell
 service
 drops
 out
 about
 30


seconds
 outside
 of
 town.
 Mass
 homicides


in
 Canada
 are
 rare.
 After
 the
 country's


deadliest
 mass
 shooting
 in
 2020,
 the


country
 launched
 major
 gun
 reforms.
 In


the
 years
 since,
 Canada
 froze
 handgun


sales
 and
 expanded
 the
 list
 of
 banned


firearms.
 Those
 efforts
 have
 proved


politically
 divisive
 in
 the
 country.


Authorities
 in
 Arizona
 have
 released
 the


first
 images
 of
 a
 possible
 suspect
 in


the
 kidnapping
 of
 Nancy
 Guthrie.
 The


84year-old,
 whose
 daughter
 Savannah
 is


one
 of the
 most
 watched
 morning
 news


anchors
 in
 the
 country,
 vanished
 from


her
 home
 near
 Tucson
 10
 days
 ago
 in
 the


middle
 of
 the
 night.
 Initially,
 the


local
 sheriff
 said
 there
 was
 no
 footage


from
 her
 house
 because
 her
 doorbell


camera
 had
 been
 deactivated,
 but


yesterday,
 authorities
 said
 they'd
 been


able
 to
 recover
 some
 data.
 The
 silent


black
 and
 white
 clips
 show
 a
 person
 in
 a


ski
 mask
 with
 a
 handgun
 approaching
 her


front
 door.
 When
 the
 person
 notices
 the


camera,
 they
 raise
 a
 gloved
 hand
 to


block
 it.
 Yesterday,
 authorities


announced
 they
 detained
 a
 person
 for


questioning.


>> So,
 you
 have
 no
 idea
 what
 led
 them
 to


you.
 Nothing.
 They
 didn't
 give
 they


didn't
 say
 car
 make
 a
 license,
 nothing.


>> But
 a
 few
 hours
 ago,
 that
 man
 was


released,
 telling
 reporters
 who
 caught


up
 with
 him
 that
 he'd
 never
 even
 heard


about
 the
 case.


>> And
 you
 don't
 even
 know
 who
 the
 lady
 is.


Do
 you
 know
 who
 Savannah
 Guthrie
 is?


>> No.


>> I
 don't
 follow
 the
 news.


>> Right.


Guthri's
 disappearance
 has
 drawn
 a
 storm


of
 attention
 from
 the
 media,
 amateur


slleuths,
 and
 true
 crime
 obsessives,


some
 of
 whom
 have
 gone
 to
 the
 scene.


Yesterday,
 a
 pizza
 was
 delivered
 to


Nancy
 Guthri's
 home
 for
 a
 YouTuber
 live


streaming
 from
 there.
 It
 was
 not
 the


only
 delivery,
 leading
 the
 local


sheriff's
 office
 to
 put
 out
 a
 statement


saying,
 "Please
 do
 not
 order
 food
 to
 a


crime
 scene.


Now,
 three
 quick
 updates
 on
 the
 Trump


administration.
 In
 Washington
 yesterday,


an
 effort
 by
 federal
 prosecutors
 to


indict
 Democratic
 lawmakers
 for
 posting


a
 video
 that
 enraged
 President
 Trump


collapsed
 in
 court.
 No
 one
 has
 to
 carry


out
 orders
 that
 violate
 the
 law
 or
 our


constitution.
 In
 the
 video
 posted
 in


November,
 the
 six
 Democrats
 reminded


active
 duty
 troops
 and
 intelligence


officers
 that
 they
 are
 obligated
 to


refuse
 illegal
 orders.
 Trump
 called
 the


message
 sedicious
 behavior
 and
 even


suggested
 the
 Democrats
 should
 be


executed.
 In
 court
 on
 Tuesday,
 jurors


refused
 to
 indict
 them
 over
 it.
 That


kind
 of
 rejection
 from
 grand
 juries
 is


becoming
 increasingly
 common
 as
 Trump


appointees
 push
 forward
 with
 legally


questionable
 cases
 in
 an
 effort
 to


appease
 the
 president.


Also,
 the
 Department
 of
 Homeland


Security,
 which
 has
 been
 under
 scrutiny


for
 echoing
 white
 supremacist
 messaging


on
 social
 media,
 has
 hired
 a
 new
 digital


communications
 director.
 But
 the
 Times


has
 learned
 that
 some
 of
 his
 former


co-workers
 raised
 the
 alarm
 about
 posts


he
 made
 at
 his
 old
 job.
 21-year-old


Payton
 Rollins
 spent
 most
 of
 the
 past


year
 overhauling
 the
 Labor
 Department's


social
 media
 pages,
 which
 started


promoting
 an
 anti-semitic
 trope
 and


Confederate
 imagery
 and
 used
 the
 type


face
 from
 the
 original
 cover
 of
 Hitler's


Mine
 Comp.
 According
 to
 internal


messages
 and
 emails
 obtained
 by
 the


Times,
 Rollins
 co-workers
 repeatedly


objected
 to
 the
 content,
 saying
 it
 made


them
 uncomfortable
 and
 that
 it
 was


getting
 engagement
 online
 from
 far-right


extremists.
 Rollins
 did
 not
 respond
 to


multiple
 requests
 for
 comment.
 And
 last


update,
 the
 drug
 maker
 Madna
 says
 that


the
 Food
 and
 Drug
 Administration
 has


refused
 to
 review
 its
 cuttingedge
 flu


vaccine.
 The
 unusual
 rejection,
 which


came
 after
 the
 company
 spent
 years
 and


hundreds
 of
 millions
 of
 dollars
 testing


its
 shot,
 is
 the
 latest
 sign
 that


federal
 health
 policy
 under
 Secretary


Robert
 F.
 Kennedy
 Jr.
 has
 become
 hostile


to
 vaccine
 development.
 Madna's
 vaccine


uses
 mRNA
 technology
 which
 was


successfully
 used
 in
 co
 vaccines.


Kennedy
 however
 has
 repeatedly


criticized
 mRNA
 vaccines
 and
 canceled


funding
 into
 their
 research
 and


development.
 The
 FDA
 told
 MADNA
 it


refused
 to
 review
 the
 drug
 because
 it


hadn't
 run
 a
 quote
 adequate
 and


well-controlled
 study
 though
 it
 didn't


site
 any
 specific
 concerns
 about
 the


product's
 safety
 or
 effectiveness.


So,
 I've
 recently
 been
 reporting
 on


fringe
 movements
 online,
 and
 researchers


are
 seeing
 some
 shocking
 stuff.
 Hate


groups
 from
 across
 the
 ideological


spectrum
 are
 taking
 advantage
 of
 the


internet
 to
 recruit
 younger
 and
 younger


children
 to
 extremism.
 My
 colleague


Pranav
 Boser
 has
 been
 looking
 into
 some


alarming
 new
 statistics
 across
 North


America
 and
 Europe.
 The
 UN
 estimates


that
 children
 now
 account
 for
 42%
 of


terrorism
 related
 investigations.
 That's


three
 times
 what
 it
 was
 just
 5
 years


ago.
 And
 in
 Europe
 in
 particular,
 as


much
 as
 a
 third
 of
 counterterrorism
 work


now
 involves
 minors
 as
 young
 as
 12
 or
 13


years
 old,
 according
 to
 a
 research
 group


in
 the
 Hague.
 Pronov
 says
 that
 in
 recent


years
 there
 have
 been
 a
 few
 high-profile


cases,
 like
 a
 15-year-old
 British
 girl


who
 was
 groomed
 online
 by
 a
 neo-Nazi
 in


Texas.
 She
 later
 downloaded
 a


bomb-making
 guide
 and
 posted
 about


blowing
 up
 a
 synagogue.
 I
 spoke
 to


dozens
 of
 radicalization
 experts,


counterrecruiters,
 parents,
 and
 young


people
 who
 have
 recently
 left
 extremist


groups.
 And
 what
 they're
 seeing
 is
 that


extremists
 are
 not
 just
 able
 to
 recruit


and
 lure
 children
 on
 social
 media,
 but


increasingly
 they're
 turning
 to
 video


games
 like
 Minecraft
 and
 Roblox.
 And
 in


doing
 so,
 they
 can
 meet
 children
 with


very
 little
 barrier
 to
 entry
 and
 move
 to


chat
 rooms
 where
 they
 can
 continue
 to


indoctrinate
 those
 children.


At
 the
 same
 time
 as
 these
 groups
 are


shifting
 their
 recruitment
 tactics
 to


conscript
 kids,
 the
 kids
 themselves
 may


be
 particularly
 vulnerable
 right
 now.
 In


many
 cases,
 minor
 swing
 between


competing
 belief
 systems
 from
 white


power
 to
 jihadism,
 which
 experts
 say


indicates
 that
 the
 crisis
 may
 stem
 more


from
 loneliness
 and
 wanting
 connection


than
 any
 particular
 ideology.
 According


to
 some
 of the
 experts
 Prana
 talked
 to,


the
 growing
 number
 of
 kids
 radicalized


online
 won't
 necessarily
 translate
 to


realworld
 violence
 in
 the
 near
 term,
 but


they
 worry
 that
 extremist
 ideologies


could
 simmer
 in
 kids
 for
 years
 to
 come.


In
 statements
 to
 the
 Times,
 Roblox
 and


Microsoft,
 which
 owns
 Minecraft,
 said


they
 use
 multiple
 technologies
 to
 ensure


safety
 on
 their
 platforms,
 though
 Roblox


added
 that
 no
 system
 is
 perfect,
 so


parents
 should
 talk
 to
 their
 kids
 about


online
 risks.


And
 finally,
 on
 the
 sidelines
 of
 the


Olympics,
 beyond
 the
 skiing,
 skating,


shooting,
 luing,
 the
 Times
 has
 been


covering
 a
 few
 stories
 about
 the


athletes
 themselves
 that
 have
 nothing
 to


do
 with
 their
 performance
 or
 metal
 count


or
 race
 times.
 A
 few
 that
 have
 caught


our
 eye
 for
 different
 reasons.


Australia.


>> Yesterday,
 right
 after
 a
 Norwegian


bathlete
 clinched
 bronze
 in
 his
 race,
 he


got
 super
 emotional
 on
 camera
 as
 he


admitted
 on
 live
 TV
 that
 he'd
 cheated
 on


his
 girlfriend
 a
 few
 months
 ago
 and
 just


really
 wanted
 her
 back.


>> Despite
 his
 win,
 he
 said
 it
 was
 the


worst
 week
 of
 his
 life.
 In
 terms
 of
 why


he
 chose
 to
 share
 this,
 he
 later
 said
 he


thought
 the
 only
 way
 he
 could
 win
 her


back
 was
 to
 quote,
 "Put
 everything
 on


the
 table
 and
 hope
 that
 she
 can
 still


love
 me."


Another
 remarkable
 story
 to
 watch.
 This


week,
 a
 mother
 and
 son
 representing
 team


Mexico
 will
 compete
 in
 alpine
 skiing,


becoming
 the
 first
 mother-son
 pair
 to


ever
 appear
 at
 the
 same
 winter
 games.


The
 46-year-old
 mom,
 Sarah
 Schleer,
 is


in
 her
 seventh
 Olympics,
 while
 her


18-year-old
 son,
 Lassa,
 is
 competing
 in


his
 first.


And
 last
 one.


>> An
 athlete
 from
 Ukraine,
 a
 skeleton


racer,
 says
 he's
 going
 to
 defy
 Olympic


organizers
 who
 told
 him
 he
 couldn't
 wear


a
 helmet
 decorated
 with
 pictures
 of


Ukrainians
 killed
 in
 the
 war
 with


Russia.
 Olympic
 officials
 say
 the
 helmet


violates
 the
 game's
 ban
 on
 political


speech
 and
 suggested
 he
 wear
 a
 solid


black
 armband
 instead.
 The
 athlete


dismissed
 that
 and
 said
 there
 are
 not


enough
 black
 armbands
 in
 all
 of
 Cortina


to
 honor
 the
 dead.
 He
 said
 he's
 willing


to
 risk
 being
 disqualified
 and
 that
 he


will
 wear
 the
 helmet
 during
 training


today
 and
 in
 races
 later
 this
 week.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
 Today
 on
 the


Daily,
 a
 deeper
 look
 at
 the
 Trump
 RX


site,
 which
 went
 up
 last
 week
 with
 the


promise
 of
 saving
 Americans
 money
 on


their
 prescriptions.
