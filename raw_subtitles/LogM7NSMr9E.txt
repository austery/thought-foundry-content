This next one is another LLM call where we're basically describing what Suzy does. And we're saying analyze the key areas of interest data in the transcript and output a bunch of keywords that we should be buying in Google. So if customers are describing what they're interested in or what we sell, and we're not running Google keywords for them, we want to. So basically, these keywords will be mentioned, we extract. then and then we run an automation to add those keywords to our Google campaigns automatically. Not only are you taking the account level specific context, but you're saying our customers will tell us in their words what they're looking for, what problems they're trying to solve. These customer calls are a rich source of market insight and so you're going to use these customer calls to actually extract out market surface areas, keywords, places where you can put marketing dollars against and then reach customers similar to the customers that you're successful with, which is a really nice closed loops pollution.
