Welcome
 everyone
 to
 the
 OnPy
 podcast.


I'm
 Steve
 Pacen


>> and
 I'm
 John
 Michael
 McGrath.


>> Today
 on
 the
 pod,
 as
 you
 know,
 the


United
 States
 Supreme
 Court
 has
 struck


down
 some
 of
 Donald
 Trump's
 [music]


tariffs.
 Now
 Doug
 Ford
 is
 looking
 for
 a


refund.


>> The
 Financial
 Accountability
 Office
 has


a
 new
 report
 on
 the
 state
 of
 Ontario's


economy,
 and
 we'll
 dig
 into
 all
 the


nerdy
 [music]
 details.


>> Renovations
 at
 the
 biggest
 block
 in


downtown
 Toronto,
 where
 the
 largest


number
 of
 public
 [music]
 servants
 work,


look
 like
 they're
 going
 over
 budget
 and


beyond
 schedule.
 And
 at
 the
 moment,


there
 are
 no
 plans
 to
 find
 the
 employees


any
 new
 space.


>> And
 in
 your
 column,
 my
 column,
 I'll
 look


at
 a
 big
 gamble
 the
 city
 of
 Burlington


is
 making
 on
 the
 housing
 file
 and
 what


it
 could
 mean
 for
 the
 province.


>> And
 I'm
 still
 focused
 on
 the
 Ontario


Liberal
 leadership
 election
 coming
 up


later
 this
 year.
 Four
 and
 a
 half
 decades


ago,
 the
 party
 chose
 a
 38-year-old
 to
 be


their
 new
 leader.
 Three
 years
 later,
 he


was
 premier.
 Could
 a
 38-year-old
 turn


the
 trick
 this
 time
 as
 well?


>> It's
 Friday,
 February
 27th,
 2026.
 So,


let's
 get
 to
 it.


>> Okay.
 JMM,
 our
 traditional
 sugar
 to


start
 things
 out.


>> Yes,
 sir.


>> And
 now
 we
 can
 mourn.


>> And
 now
 we
 can
 mourn.
 I
 notice
 you
 have


underneath
 the
 goose.
 That
 goose
 doesn't


refer
 to
 our
 goose
 having
 been
 cooked
 at


the
 Olympics,
 was
 it?


>> No.
 No.
 But
 in
 so
 far
 as
 I'm
 referring


to
 the
 the
 outcome
 of
 the
 Olympics,
 you


might
 have
 seen
 the
 um
 uh
 distasteful


message
 that
 the
 president
 tweeted
 about


of
 a
 a
 an
 eagle
 attacking
 a
 Canadian


goose.
 Yes.
 Did
 not
 love
 the
 image.
 Uh


but
 I
 I
 stand
 in
 solidarity
 with
 the


geese.
 Uh
 you
 know
 uh
 [laughter]


>> it
 works
 solidarity
 with
 with
 all
 the


Canadian
 icons.
 Right.


>> There
 you
 go.
 Why
 not?
 Why
 not?
 Well,
 I


am
 Look
 at
 first
 first
 things
 first.
 the


the
 men's
 and
 women's
 gold
 medal
 hockey


games
 were
 fabulous
 and
 they
 were
 they


were
 entertaining.
 I
 thought
 our


athletes
 played,
 you
 know,
 spectacularly


well.
 You
 got
 to
 remember
 the
 women
 lost


5-
 nothing
 to
 the
 Americans
 in
 the


earlier
 round
 and
 then
 it
 went
 to


overtime
 in
 the
 gold
 medal
 game.
 The
 men


complet,
 let's
 be
 honest
 here.
 Yes,
 the


Americans
 won.
 And
 congratulations
 to


our
 American
 viewers
 and
 listeners.
 Uh


full
 value.
 Your
 goalie
 stood
 on
 his


head.
 I
 think
 he's
 got
 the
 Presidential


Medal
 of
 Freedom
 now
 or
 Congressional


Medal
 of
 Honor
 or
 something
 now.
 Connor


H.
 We
 got
 hella
 bucked.
 Look,
 we
 got


hella
 bucked.
 Uh,
 but
 our
 guys
 totally


outplayed
 their
 guys
 and
 uh
 they
 they


represented
 us
 extremely
 well,
 which
 is


why
 I'm
 not
 wearing
 a
 premier
 today.


Here
 we
 go.
 I
 am
 wearing
 this
 is
 from


not
 double
 silver,
 which
 we
 did
 this


year,
 but
 this
 is
 from
 the
 2002
 Olympics


in
 Salt
 Lake
 City
 when
 we
 did
 double


gold.
 So,
 this
 shirt
 is
 from
 20
 This


jersey,
 excuse
 me,
 shirt
 is
 something


you'd
 say.
 Uh
 this
 jersey
 is
 from
 24


years
 ago
 and
 uh
 I
 will
 continue
 to
 have


the
 happy
 memories
 of
 the
 double
 hockey


gold
 in
 that
 one
 and
 we'll
 get
 them
 next


time
 uh
 for
 hockey
 gold
 in
 the
 next


Olympics.


>> So
 I
 I
 will
 say
 you
 know
 uh
 if
 anybody


out
 there
 is
 watching
 uh
 you
 you
 uh
 you


gave
 me
 some
 static
 last
 week
 about
 not


watching
 the
 game
 sufficiently.
 I
 did


>> as
 as
 as
 I
 should
 have.
 [laughter]


>> I
 did
 watch
 the
 game.
 Good
 for
 you.
 Uh


bullying
 works.
 Uh,
 [laughter]
 if


anybody
 else
 would
 like
 to
 be
 bullied
 by


an
 Order
 of
 Canada
 member,
 they
 should


work
 here
 at
 TBO.
 [laughter]
 Um,
 the


other
 reason
 I'm
 wearing
 this
 shirt,


however,
 uh,
 I
 I
 wore
 this
 shirt
 for
 a


segment
 that
 we
 recorded
 for
 the


rundown,
 a
 very
 brief
 little
 thing
 about


the
 history
 of
 uranium
 mining
 in


Ontario,
 uh,
 that
 aired,
 uh,
 last
 night


on
 TVO.
 And,
 of
 course,
 always
 want
 to


encourage,
 uh,
 our
 audience
 to
 check
 out


the
 rundown.
 Lots
 of
 great
 stuff
 there.


And,
 uh,
 this
 one,
 uh,
 about
 the
 the
 the


history,
 as
 I
 say,
 of
 of
 uranium
 mining


in
 Ontario.
 I
 always
 forget
 just
 how
 uh


how
 big
 a
 role
 we
 played
 in
 helping
 the


Americans
 build
 the
 first
 atomic
 bombs


just
 as
 a
 for
 example.


>> There
 you
 go.
 There
 you
 go.
 We
 should


also
 say
 and
 speaking
 of
 the
 word


recorded,
 we
 record
 this,
 this
 is
 not


live
 on
 television
 at
 8:00
 on
 Friday


night.
 We
 do
 record
 this
 uh
 earlier
 and


the
 government
 of
 Ontario
 is
 as
 we
 speak


making
 an
 announcement
 unveiling
 new


details
 about
 the
 Ontario
 Science
 Center


and
 its
 new
 location.
 So,
 because
 that's


happening
 now,
 we
 obviously
 are
 not


going
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 details
 other


than
 to
 say
 the
 pictures
 are
 pretty.


>> Yes,


>> the
 plans
 look
 pretty.


>> Yes,
 the
 renderings
 always
 look
 so


great.


>> The
 renderings
 look
 [laughter]
 great.


And
 we
 will
 have
 presumably
 more
 to
 say


about
 this
 next
 week
 when
 we've
 had
 a


chance
 to
 dive
 in
 further.


>> Yeah,
 we'll
 see
 if
 there's
 any
 more


substantive
 changes
 with
 the
 plans
 as


they've
 been
 announced.
 Obviously,
 this


is
 something
 we've
 been
 following
 now


for
 years
 plus
 years.
 So,
 yeah,


absolutely.
 Okay,
 shall
 we
 get
 to
 it?


Let's
 do
 it.
 Off
 to
 issue
 one.


Late
 last
 week,
 the
 United
 States


Supreme
 Court
 struck
 down
 Donald
 Trump's


emergency
 tariffs.
 Then
 in
 retaliation,


Trump
 announced
 a
 new
 global
 tariff,


which
 luckily
 Canada
 is
 exempt
 from


because
 of
 the
 Kusma
 or
 USA
 smacka,


whichever
 deal,
 whatever
 you
 prefer.


JMM,
 let's
 dig
 into
 this
 situation
 and


the
 potential
 impact
 here
 in
 the


province
 of
 Ontario.
 What
 do
 we
 know?


>> Right.
 So
 the
 tariffs
 in
 question
 are


the
 so-called
 liberation
 day
 tariffs


from
 uh
 early
 last
 year
 that
 uh
 Trump


invoked
 saying
 that
 he
 had
 the
 power
 to


do
 so
 unilaterally
 i.e
 without
 uh
 the


approval
 of
 Congress
 under
 the


International
 Emergency
 Economic
 Powers


Act
 or
 AIPA.
 Having
 lots
 of
 fun
 with


acronyms
 this
 morning
 um
 a
 coalition
 of


small
 and
 medium-sized
 businesses


challenged
 the
 tariffs
 in
 court
 and


after
 a
 lengthy
 wait
 the
 court
 heard


this
 case
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 heard
 this


case
 back
 in
 November.
 A
 sixth
 justice


majority
 on
 the
 court
 ruled
 that
 the


tariffs
 were
 in
 fact
 illegal
 under
 AIPA.


I'm
 just
 going
 to
 enjoy
 continuing
 to


say
 that


>> and
 I
 say
 you
 smack.
 [laughter]


I
 say
 no.
 Anyway,
 let's
 pull
 the
 whole


thing
 off.


>> The
 majority
 found
 that
 uh
 the
 the


tariffs
 were
 illegal.
 The
 law
 as
 written


could
 not
 justify
 uh
 the
 use
 of
 tariffs.


The
 the
 law
 gives
 the
 president
 power
 to


uh
 regulate
 and
 and
 make
 other
 policy


regarding
 trade.
 But
 the
 the
 majority


found
 that
 uh
 it
 did
 not
 give
 him
 the


power
 to
 use
 tariffs
 in
 this
 way.
 uh


three
 Republican
 justices
 did
 dissent,


but
 the
 majority
 includes
 three
 other


Republicans
 and
 the
 court's
 three


Democrats.
 Uh
 the
 majority,
 you
 may
 not


be
 surprised
 to
 learn,
 uh
 disagreed
 in


key
 ways,
 right?
 Like
 three
 Republicans


and
 three
 Democrats.
 They


>> they
 came
 together
 on
 the
 core
 issue,


but
 they
 all
 had
 different


interpretations,
 if
 if
 I
 could
 put
 it


that
 way.
 Um
 so
 I'm
 going
 to
 grossly
 uh


summarize
 condense
 the
 decision


hopefully
 without
 doing
 too
 much


violence
 to
 it.
 Um
 either
 Trump's


tariffs
 were
 illegal
 under
 AIPA
 because


the
 law
 simply
 did
 not
 give
 him
 those


powers
 or
 if
 the
 law
 did
 in
 fact
 give


him
 those
 powers
 then
 the
 law
 itself
 was


unconstitutional
 because
 tariffs
 are
 a


tax.
 They
 are
 a
 tax
 paid
 by
 Americans


and
 uh
 under
 the
 US
 Constitution,
 it
 is


Congress
 and
 only
 Congress
 that
 has
 the


power
 to
 levy
 taxes
 unless
 they


unambiguously
 delegate
 that
 power
 or
 any


of
 their
 powers
 uh
 to
 the
 president,


which
 the
 court
 found
 that
 they
 had
 not


in
 this
 case.


>> And
 just
 to
 be
 clear,
 you're
 you
 know,


when
 you
 say
 the
 Republican
 justices
 and


the
 Democrat
 justices,
 you
 mean
 those


appointed
 by
 a
 Republican
 president
 or
 a


Democratic
 president?


>> Yes.
 Formally
 speaking,
 the
 Supreme


Court
 is
 not
 a
 partisan
 body.
 Um


although


>> h
 how
 much
 more
 uh
 we
 want
 to
 extend


that
 charity
 to
 uh
 the
 the
 the
 court
 is


um
 up
 for
 debate.


>> Up
 for
 debate.
 Yes
 indeed.
 Um
 so
 the
 big


question,
 do
 we
 got
 our
 money
 back?


What's
 the
 story
 now?
 [laughter]


>> So
 this
 is
 uh
 the
 key
 point
 that
 at


least
 the
 vast
 majority
 of
 Canadian


trade
 was
 not
 affected
 by
 these
 specific


uh
 tariffs.
 the
 vast
 majority
 of
 our


exports
 uh
 were
 entering
 the
 country
 uh


under
 the
 the
 exemptions
 we
 had
 under


Kousma
 or
 USA.
 Um
 we're
 going
 to
 get


back
 to
 that
 in
 in
 one
 second.
 Um
 but


for
 example,
 the
 the
 Royal
 Bank
 of


Canada
 has
 calculated
 that
 Canada
 was


paying
 an
 effective
 tariff
 rate
 of
 3.1%


which
 is
 in
 fact
 was
 uh
 the
 lowest
 of


all
 of
 America's
 major
 trading
 partners.


Um
 however
 there
 I
 guess
 there's
 two


howevers.
 one
 uh
 there's
 certainly
 an


argument
 that
 uh
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 trade


that
 used
 to
 happen
 seamlessly
 is
 now
 uh


now
 requires
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 paperwork


uh
 to
 comply
 under
 KUSA.
 So
 there
 is
 a


um
 a
 hidden
 trade
 burden
 if
 you
 want
 to


put
 it
 that
 way.
 Uh
 separately
 uh
 some


have
 argued
 that
 while
 this
 uh
 this


specific
 decision
 does
 not
 directly


affect
 Canada,
 it
 could
 help
 us
 in


negotiations
 because
 Kousma
 is
 getting


renegotiated
 this
 year
 uh
 in
 uh
 July.


And
 this
 was
 specifically
 the
 section
 of


law
 that
 Trump
 was
 using
 to
 bully


countries
 around
 the
 world
 by
 suddenly


announcing
 that
 I
 don't
 like
 the
 cut
 of


your
 jib.
 So
 here's
 an
 extra
 10
 15%


tariff.
 you
 said
 something
 mean
 about


me.
 Here's
 an
 extra
 5%
 tariff.
 I
 don't


like
 the
 sound
 of
 your
 voice,
 etc.,
 etc.


Uh,
 he
 no
 longer
 has
 that
 uh
 uh
 lever
 to


pull
 in
 international
 uh
 trade
 policy.


So,
 that
 might
 strengthen
 our
 hand
 in


renegotiations.
 However,
 the
 Trump
 White


House
 has
 already
 said
 that
 they
 are


looking
 to
 rebuild
 the
 tariff
 regime


using
 other
 uh
 sections
 of
 law.


I
 don't
 think
 we've
 ever
 had
 a
 premier


of
 Ontario
 who
 has
 appeared
 on
 American


television
 as
 much
 as
 the
 current


premier
 of
 Ontario
 has.
 And
 of
 course,


it
 started
 with
 the
 tariffs
 and
 Donald


Trump
 and
 uh
 he
 was
 back
 on
 CNN
 this


past
 week
 uh
 talking
 about
 this
 decision


from
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 and
 what
 impact


it
 might
 have
 on
 us.
 So
 why
 don't
 we


check
 what
 the
 premier
 of
 Ontario
 had
 to


say.
 Doug
 Ford,


>> we
 have
 to
 get
 to
 a
 resolution
 as


quickly
 as
 possible
 to
 really
 give
 the


the
 American
 people
 and
 the
 Canadian


people
 the
 certainty
 that
 they
 need.
 The


walls
 are
 closing
 in,
 I
 believe,
 on


President
 uh
 Trump
 right
 now
 and
 he's


feeling
 the
 pressure.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of these


jobs
 are
 border
 border
 states
 uh
 that


are
 being
 affected
 and
 he
 needs
 those


seats.
 So,
 if
 it
 continues
 on,
 people


are
 going
 to
 they're
 going
 to
 be


unemployed
 and
 uh
 which
 will
 affect
 the


the
 midterms.


>> Well,
 the
 midterms
 is
 the
 key,
 right?


They're
 coming
 up
 in
 November
 at
 the


moment.
 Of
 course,
 the
 president's


party,
 the
 Republicans
 have
 the
 White


House,
 they
 have
 the
 House
 of


Representatives,
 and
 they
 have
 the


Senate.
 But
 with
 a
 third
 of
 the
 Senate


up
 for
 grabs
 at
 the
 midterms
 and
 the


entire
 House
 of
 Representatives,
 uh
 the


premier
 clearly
 believes
 that
 if
 and


it's
 a
 big
 if,
 but
 if
 Donald
 Trump
 loses


his
 majorities
 in
 one
 or
 heaven
 forend


both
 of
 those
 houses,
 Canada
 might
 be
 in


a
 better
 position
 to
 renegotiate,
 you


smack
 a
 Kusma,
 whatever
 you
 want
 to
 call


it.
 However,
 that's
 not
 the
 end
 of
 the


story,
 right?


>> No,
 there's
 a
 calendar
 problem
 here.
 Uh


July
 1st
 of
 this
 year
 of
 2026
 is
 when
 uh


Canada,
 Mexico,
 and
 the
 United
 States


all
 have
 to
 indicate
 in
 writing
 whether


they
 intend
 to
 continue
 with
 this


agreement.
 Uh
 which
 just
 to
 remind
 our


uh
 audience,
 uh
 Donald
 Trump
 negotiated


in
 the
 first
 place
 in
 his
 first
 term,


>> at
 which
 time
 it
 was
 the
 greatest


agreement
 ever
 signed
 in
 American


history.


>> Yes,
 absolutely.
 And
 and
 now
 only
 a
 few


years
 later,
 it's
 the
 biggest
 disaster


uh
 in
 history.
 Whose
 idea
 was
 this


anyway?
 [laughter]
 Um
 so
 the
 the


renegotiations
 have
 to
 start
 in
 July.
 Uh


the
 midterms
 are
 not
 until
 November.
 So


they
 can't
 directly
 affect
 the
 outcome


of
 uh
 negotiations
 for
 uh
 Canada's
 sake


at least.
 Now
 this
 is
 politics,
 right?


If
 uh
 Republican
 numbers
 continue
 to


look
 uh
 very
 dire
 um


>> which
 they
 do
 at
 the
 moment.


>> They
 do.
 I
 mean,
 you
 mentioned
 the


Senate.
 Like,
 up
 until
 even
 a
 few
 months


ago,
 I
 think
 the
 conventional
 wisdom
 was


that
 while
 the
 Democrats
 might
 retake


the
 House,
 the
 Senate
 was
 beyond
 uh


consideration.
 Just
 some
 years,
 it's


just
 not
 really
 not
 in
 the
 cards.


Exactly.
 Um,
 but
 there
 are
 now
 realistic


polls
 showing
 that
 they
 could
 even
 win


the
 Senate
 seat
 in
 Texas.
 uh
 which
 would


if
 that
 might
 end
 up
 being
 the
 50th
 uh


seat
 that
 they
 need
 to
 win,
 right?


>> So
 anyway,
 if
 these
 numbers
 continue
 to


be
 dire
 for
 the
 Republicans,
 then
 you


could
 imagine
 some
 uh
 GOP
 leaders,
 some


people
 in
 Congress,
 some
 people
 who
 are


desperate
 to
 hang
 on
 to
 their
 seats,


just
 begging
 Donald
 Trump
 to,
 you
 know,


play
 it
 cool
 for
 a
 little
 bit,
 at least


until
 after
 the
 midterms.
 And
 uh
 you


know
 maybe
 we
 we
 get
 lucky
 on
 that


score.
 Uh
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 uh
 Bloomberg


News
 reported
 earlier
 this
 month
 that
 uh


Trump
 is
 apparently
 walking
 around
 the


White
 House
 idly
 asking
 his
 staff
 why
 he


shouldn't
 just
 take
 the
 US
 out
 of
 this


agreement
 altogether
 which
 is
 a
 power


that
 he
 has.


>> Well
 if
 the
 idea
 was
 to
 play
 it
 cool
 I'm


not
 sure
 he
 did
 that
 at
 the
 State
 of
 the


Union
 address
 earlier
 this
 week.
 There


wasn't
 a
 lot
 of
 playing
 it
 cool
 there.


There
 were
 some
 pretty
 rough
 moments
 in


that
 speech.
 You
 mentioned
 Texas


previous


>> the
 longest
 speech,
 the
 longest
 state
 of


the
 union
 speech
 ever
 in
 I
 I
 will


confess
 I
 did
 not
 watch
 that
 one.
 Some


some
 years
 I
 watched
 the
 State
 of
 the


Union.
 I
 thought
 it
 probably
 best
 for
 my


mental
 and
 cardiac
 health
 that
 I
 not


watch.


>> Okay,
 back
 on
 track
 here.
 Premier
 Ford


is
 going
 to
 the
 states.
 He's
 going to
 go


down
 to
 Texas.
 He's
 going
 to
 go
 to
 Utah


in
 the
 spring
 and
 the
 summer.
 He's
 going


to
 be
 continuing
 his
 involvement
 in
 the


United
 States
 and
 Canada
 as
 it
 relates


to
 trade
 relations.
 He's
 also
 said,
 now


I'm
 not
 sure
 how
 far
 this
 is
 going
 to


go,
 but
 he's
 also
 [laughter]
 said
 he'd


love
 a
 refund
 on
 the
 tariffs
 that


Washington
 has
 collected
 and
 which


Canadians
 have
 paid.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 that


it
 works
 that
 way,
 but
 I
 don't
 know.


What
 do
 you
 think?


>> No.
 So,
 the
 tariffs
 were
 uh
 collected
 by


the
 American
 government
 uh
 off
 of


purchases
 made
 by
 American
 customers,


right?
 businesses
 and
 consumers
 uh


something
 like
 $175
 billion
 uh
 in
 the


last
 year
 uh
 which
 is
 estimated
 to
 be


about
 $1,300
 per
 US
 household.


>> So
 much
 for
 that
 tax
 cut.


>> I
 I
 suspect
 they
 will
 keep
 the
 tax
 cuts


and
 just
 let
 their
 deficit
 grow
 larger.


But
 that's
 a
 prediction.
 Um
 you
 know,


one
 thing
 about
 this
 Supreme
 Court


decision
 is
 that
 they
 did
 not
 spell
 out


uh
 if
 or
 how
 or
 or
 why
 or
 when
 uh
 there


should
 be
 a
 refund.
 That
 is
 going
 to
 be


a
 matter
 that
 will
 continue
 to
 be


litigated.
 Um,
 in
 any
 case,
 I
 do
 not


expect
 us
 to
 see
 any
 uh
 direct
 benefit


uh
 uh
 in
 Canadian
 uh
 consumers
 pockets.


Um,
 I
 think
 actually
 the
 analogy
 that


Doug
 Ford
 is
 reaching
 for
 is
 that
 we


would
 like
 to
 see
 reparations
 from
 the


US
 government
 for
 uh
 the
 uh
 uh
 regime
 of


of
 threats
 and
 bullying
 that
 we've
 seen.


Uh
 I'm
 not
 super
 optimistic
 about
 that.


>> Advice
 to
 Premier,
 don't
 hold
 your


breath
 on
 that
 one.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 Um,
 and
 then
 about
 the


premier's
 travels,
 I
 I
 have
 to
 say
 it's


going
 to
 be
 very
 interesting
 to
 see
 how


the
 premier
 gets
 along
 with
 some
 of


these
 other
 Republican
 governors.
 And,


you
 know,
 you
 might
 think
 that
 like
 he's


a
 conservative
 politician.
 He
 might
 get


along
 well
 with
 other
 um
 conservative


politicians,
 other
 Republican
 governors,


that
 kind
 of
 thing.
 But
 like
 the


Republican
 governor
 of
 Texas
 is
 very


Republican
 and
 like
 a
 very
 Trumpy
 and


very
 mega.
 And
 I
 when
 I
 say
 it
 will
 be


interesting.
 That's
 literally
 what
 I
 I


mean
 I
 I
 I'm
 not
 trying
 to
 be
 uh
 cute


about
 this.
 I
 just
 I
 I'm
 genuinely


curious
 to
 see
 uh
 how
 they
 get
 along,
 if


they
 are
 able
 to,
 you
 know,
 do
 the
 usual


like,
 you
 know,
 smile
 and
 handshake


photo
 op
 or
 whether
 it
 becomes
 a
 bit
 of


a
 fiasco.


>> Well,
 I
 don't
 think
 I'm
 out
 over
 my
 skis


in
 saying
 that
 if
 times
 were
 different,


this
 would
 be
 a
 wholly
 different


meeting.
 which
 is
 to
 say
 Doug
 Ford,
 you


know,
 before
 Donald
 Trump
 became


president,
 Doug
 Ford
 was
 a
 kind
 of


populist
 conservative
 who
 has
 sort
 of


changed
 his
 stripes
 into
 a
 more


moderate,
 pragmatic,
 progressive


conservative
 um
 in
 large
 measure
 because


of
 the
 election
 of
 President
 Trump
 and


um
 the
 premier
 obviously
 needed
 to
 pivot


in
 order
 to
 win
 re-election
 here
 because


anybody
 who
 was
 close
 to
 Trump,
 which
 he


was,
 remember
 he
 was
 a
 fan
 of
 Donald


Trump's
 when
 he
 first
 got
 elected
 back


in


>> even
 when
 remember
 his
 hot
 mic
 moment.


He
 said
 he
 was
 happy
 to
 see
 Trump


re-elected.


>> There
 you
 go.
 There
 you
 go.
 But
 um
 how


do
 we
 put
 this?
 Things
 changed


>> indeed.
 Uh
 so
 he
 will
 travel
 to
 the
 US.


He
 perhaps
 he
 will
 be
 able
 to
 rebuild


some
 bridges
 with
 uh
 other
 American


politicians.
 He
 is
 the
 first
 to
 say
 and


often
 saying
 that
 you
 know
 keeping


Ontario's
 economy
 uh
 humming
 is
 uh
 one


of
 his
 biggest
 jobs.
 And
 I
 believe
 that


will
 bring
 us
 to
 our
 next
 segment.


>> Indeed.
 It
 shall
 off
 to
 issue
 two.


This
 week,
 the
 Financial
 Accountability


Office,
 the
 nonpartisan
 group
 that
 keeps


an
 eye
 on
 our
 economy,
 issued
 one
 of
 its


regular
 reports
 about
 how
 we're
 doing.


The
 good
 news
 is
 that
 after
 shrinking


somewhat
 in
 the
 second
 quarter
 of
 2025,


the
 provincial
 economy
 is
 growing
 again.


The
 bad
 news,
 he
 gets
 to
 tell
 you
 that.


[laughter]


>> Sure.
 Make
 me
 the
 bad
 guy
 here.
 Um,
 yes,


the
 FAO
 has
 issued
 their
 regular
 Ontario


Economic
 Monitor
 report,
 and
 this
 is
 one


of
 the
 regular
 reports
 that
 they
 issue.


We
 don't
 always
 mention
 it
 when
 they


release
 it
 on
 the
 podcast
 uh
 because
 uh


you
 know
 it's
 just
 it's
 it's
 a
 regular


issue.
 Um
 but
 this
 time
 there
 was
 some


interesting
 details
 that
 we
 wanted
 to


highlight
 particularly
 in
 light
 of
 the


whole
 uh
 Trump
 tariff
 issue
 that
 we
 just


uh
 talked
 about.
 But
 yes,
 as
 you
 said,


the
 economy
 does
 seem
 to
 be
 growing


again,
 albeit
 slower
 than
 governments


would
 usually
 like.
 We're
 still
 less


than,
 you
 know,
 the
 2%
 growth
 that
 you


usually
 uh
 aim
 for,
 you
 know,
 being
 at


or
 above.
 Um
 and
 uh
 the
 the
 bad
 news


that
 you've
 given
 me
 the
 a
 sad
 job
 of


relaying
 here
 comes
 in
 a
 few
 areas.
 Uh


the
 FAO
 still
 describes
 Ontario's


unemployment
 rate
 as
 elevated.
 Uh
 though


youth
 unemployment
 did
 uh
 come
 down


slightly.
 Uh
 people
 who
 are
 unemployed


are
 also
 having
 a
 harder
 time
 even
 just


finding
 job
 opportunities
 as
 vacancies


trend
 down.
 The
 FAO
 says
 that
 long-term


unemployment
 uh
 is
 at
 its
 highest
 rate


since
 the
 mid
 1990s.
 Hm.
 Now,
 just
 for


our
 younger
 viewers,
 we
 should
 remind


them
 that
 the
 1990s
 were
 a
 very


difficult
 time
 in
 the
 province
 of


Ontario.
 We
 had
 the
 worst
 recession


since
 the
 Great
 Depression
 of
 the
 20s


and
 30s
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 1990s.


And
 then,
 of
 course,


>> I
 mean,
 that
 that
 kind
 of
 torpedoed
 Bob


Ray's
 government,
 led
 to
 Mike
 Harris


being
 uh
 elected
 in
 1995,
 after
 which


time
 the
 Common
 Sense
 Revolution
 was


brought
 in,
 and
 those
 were
 tumultuous
 uh


times
 in
 the
 province
 of
 Ontario.
 I
 say


tumultuous
 in
 a
 neutral
 way.
 A
 lot
 of


people
 loved
 it.
 A
 lot
 of
 people


couldn't
 stand
 it
 anyway.
 They
 were


revolutionary
 times
 to
 be
 sure.


>> Yeah.
 Exactly.
 And
 so
 now
 obviously


we're
 not
 saying
 that
 the
 economy
 is
 as


bad
 as
 it
 was
 back
 then.
 Just
 that
 that


that
 specific
 indicator
 is
 definitely


dismal
 I
 think is
 a
 fair
 word.
 You
 would


like
 to
 see
 that
 doing
 better.
 Um
 there


was
 a
 bit
 of
 good
 news
 in
 the
 housing


sector
 in
 a
 sense
 [laughter]
 in
 that
 we


closed
 out
 2025
 with
 more
 housing
 starts


than
 we
 saw
 earlier
 in
 the
 year.
 But,


uh,
 this,
 uh,
 sometimes
 use
 the
 phrase


dead
 cat
 bounce
 in
 this
 line
 of
 work.
 It


was
 still
 pretty
 bad.
 Uh,
 Ontario
 had


fewer
 new
 home
 starts
 in
 2025
 than
 in


any
 year
 since
 2014.


>> Hm.
 Okay.
 And
 you're
 going to
 have
 more


to
 say
 on
 housing
 when
 we
 do
 your


column,
 my
 column.
 So,
 everybody
 stay


tuned
 for
 that.


>> We
 teased
 our
 listeners
 with
 something


relevant
 to
 Trump's
 tariffs.
 What
 else


you
 got
 to
 say
 on
 that?


>> Right.
 So,
 this
 was
 really
 interesting.


The
 FAO
 says
 that
 we
 are
 seeing
 the


impact
 of
 Trump's
 tariffs
 in
 Ontario's


trade
 with
 the
 US
 and
 that
 is
 despite


the
 fact
 as
 we've
 mentioned
 that
 most


Canadian
 goods
 are
 not
 directly
 affected


by
 these
 tariffs.
 Uh
 Ontario's
 exports


to
 the
 US
 shrank
 by
 4%
 in
 2025
 while


exports
 to
 everywhere
 else
 in
 the
 world


grew
 by
 17%.
 Uh
 imports
 are
 a
 similar


story.
 Uh
 we
 bought
 4.3%
 fewer
 goods
 in


dollar
 terms
 from
 the
 US
 and
 we
 bought


8.6%
 6%
 more
 from
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world.


>> Now,
 before
 everybody
 gets
 a
 little
 too


excited
 about
 this,
 let's
 remind


everybody
 we're
 still
 beside
 them.
 Yes.


>> They're
 still
 the
 biggest
 economy
 in
 the


world.
 Yes.


>> And
 we're
 still
 very
 dependent
 on
 them,


aren't
 we?


>> Yes.
 The
 the
 the
 laws
 of
 economic


gravity
 still
 apply
 here.
 Uh
 so,
 yeah,


we'll
 put
 these
 numbers
 in
 a
 bit
 of


context.
 The
 US
 is
 overwhelmingly
 still


the
 biggest
 customer
 for
 goods
 made
 in


Ontario.
 83.3%
 of
 all
 international


exports
 uh
 went
 to
 the
 US.
 uh
 exports
 to


the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 are
 growing


relatively
 quickly,
 but
 still
 from
 a


much
 much
 smaller
 base.
 So,
 it's
 going


to
 be
 a
 while
 before
 uh
 anyone
 ever


displaces
 the
 US.
 Uh
 imports
 are
 a


different
 story.
 And
 this
 I
 I
 thought


really
 was
 interesting.
 Uh
 for
 the
 first


time,
 I
 think
 in
 Ontario's
 history,
 uh


Ontario
 consumers
 and
 businesses


imported
 more
 from
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world


than
 we
 did
 from
 the
 US.
 Now,
 this
 is


part
 of
 a
 trend
 that
 long
 predates
 Trump


or
 his
 tariffs.
 Ontario
 imports
 from
 the


US
 have
 been
 falling
 throughout
 the
 data


series
 that
 the
 FAO
 published.
 Um,
 but


in
 2025,
 we
 passed
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 a
 notable


milestone.
 49.6%
 of
 Ontario's
 imports


came
 from
 the
 US,
 while
 50.4%


uh
 came
 from
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world.
 So


for
 the
 first
 year,
 the
 US
 is
 now
 a


minority
 of
 imports
 from
 uh
 into
 Ontario


>> by
 that
 much.


>> Just
 just
 a
 little
 bit.
 and
 and
 and


that
 one
 I
 I
 feel
 a
 bit
 more
 secure


saying
 that
 you
 know
 this
 is
 a
 a
 trend


we
 will
 expect
 to
 continue
 simply


because
 it
 has
 been
 continuing
 through


as
 I
 say
 through
 the
 entirety
 of
 this


data
 series
 going
 back
 to
 the
 1990s.
 Um


and
 you
 know
 based
 on
 what
 I
 know
 of
 the


rest
 of
 Canada's
 economic
 history
 I
 have


to
 imagine
 that
 uh
 this
 is
 uh
 probably


something
 that
 goes
 back
 at least
 I


would
 say
 to
 the
 70s.


>> Huh.
 Okay.
 Let's
 uh
 I'm
 just
 reminding


myself
 here
 that
 Mark
 Carney's
 coming
 up


on
 a
 year
 in
 power.


>> Yes.
 And
 um
 so
 when
 Justin
 Trudeau
 was


in
 and
 Trump
 put
 the
 tariffs
 on
 us.
 Yes.


>> Trudeau
 counterveailed,
 right?
 He
 put


some
 tariffs
 initially
 on
 the
 US
 before


later
 taking
 them
 off.
 How
 did
 all
 that


work
 out?


>> Uh


later
 as
 part
 of
 attempts
 to
 sort
 of


negotiate
 and
 take
 the
 temperature
 down


on
 things,
 Mark
 Carney
 then
 removed
 many


if
 not
 all
 of
 those
 um
 counterveailing


uh
 tariffs.
 So
 it's
 possible
 that
 we're


seeing
 some
 effects
 here.
 The
 other


thing
 of
 course
 I
 would
 I
 would
 uh
 point


out
 is
 just
 not
 even
 so
 much
 a
 public


policy
 thing
 as
 a
 popular
 culture
 if
 I


could
 put
 it
 that
 way.
 You
 know
 we
 had


that
 sort
 of
 elbows
 up
 moment
 last
 year.


Uh
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 talking
 about
 you


know
 not
 buying
 Americanmade
 products


that
 not
 buying
 American
 produce
 uh
 in


the
 grocery
 stores.
 Um
 so
 it's
 possible


we're
 seeing
 uh
 some
 contribution
 from


that
 as
 well.


>> Gotcha.
 And
 with
 that
 let's
 get
 off
 to


issue
 three.


Let's
 get
 you
 another
 update
 on
 the


multi-billion
 dollar
 renovation
 project


that's
 happening
 a
 stones
 throw
 from


Queens
 Park
 at
 the
 intersection
 of
 Bay


and
 Welssley
 Streets
 in
 downtown


Toronto.
 We've
 now
 learned
 the
 project


will
 go
 over
 budget
 and
 beyond
 deadline


and
 something
 else
 too.
 What's
 up?


According
 to
 the
 CBC,
 the
 province
 is


not
 uh
 renting
 or
 or
 otherwise
 acquiring


uh
 any
 new
 space,
 any
 new
 office
 spaces


downtown
 uh
 and
 is
 still
 uh
 ordering
 its


uh
 the
 the
 Ontario
 Public
 Service
 uh


back
 to
 work
 5
 days
 a
 week
 back
 to
 the


office.
 In
 the
 CBC's
 reporting,
 they


spoke
 with
 the
 uh
 head
 of
 the


Association
 of
 Management,


Administrative,
 and
 Professional
 Crown


Employees
 or
 AMAsio
 is
 it's
 one
 of
 those


times
 I
 remember
 the
 acronym
 better
 than


the
 actual
 phrase.
 Um
 they
 represent


17,000
 workers
 in
 the
 public
 service.
 Uh


they
 say
 that,
 you
 know,
 they've
 got


cases
 of
 workers
 sharing
 desks,
 uh


crowding
 in
 common
 areas,
 uh
 managers
 in


some
 cases
 simply
 having
 to
 tell


employees
 that
 notwithstanding
 the


return
 to
 office
 mandate
 from
 the
 uh


government,
 uh
 there's
 no
 room,
 you
 just


have
 to
 go
 and
 work
 from
 home.
 Um
 so


it's
 not
 going
 smoothly,
 if
 I
 could
 put


it
 that
 way.


>> I
 must
 say
 I
 didn't
 quite
 understand
 the


obligation
 to
 go
 back
 to
 work
 5
 days
 a


week,
 which
 you
 know,
 the
 government
 of


Ontario
 made
 that
 decision
 in
 its


wisdom.
 Yes.
 but
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 give


you
 any
 offices
 to
 go
 back
 to
 because
 of


course
 this
 renovation
 job
 has
 gone
 long


and
 over
 budget.
 So
 I
 never
 quite


figured
 out
 how
 that
 was
 going
 to


compute.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 guess
 we
 should
 uh
 say
 in


spirit
 of
 disclosure
 that
 uh
 this
 return


to
 office
 mandate
 does
 bind
 to
 TVO
 as


well
 and
 and
 we
 have
 returned
 to
 the


office
 5
 days
 a
 week.
 Um
 that
 said
 you


know
 the
 allegation
 from
 uh
 unions
 like


uh
 Amapsio
 uh
 like
 uh
 QP
 like
 OPSU
 is


that
 uh
 this
 is
 not
 about


workplace
 efficiency,
 workplace


productivity
 or
 anything
 like
 that.
 That


this
 is
 in
 fact
 about
 uh
 making
 the
 work


environment
 more
 unpleasant
 uh
 for
 the


public
 sector
 and
 um
 nudging
 people
 to


>> in
 the
 hopes
 that
 people
 will
 quit.


>> Yeah.
 In
 the
 hopes
 that
 people
 will
 quit


and
 they
 will
 not
 have
 to
 be
 paid


severance.
 Certainly
 um
 you
 know
 it's


not
 just
 the
 the
 public
 statements
 from


uh
 the
 union
 saying
 this.
 Uh
 you
 can
 if


you
 know
 where
 to
 look
 uh
 on
 social


media
 you
 can
 find
 the
 places
 where
 uh


Ontario
 public
 servants
 are
 are
 venting


and
 uh
 you
 know
 people
 are
 you
 know


whether
 it's
 Twitter
 or
 Facebook
 or


Reddit
 you
 can
 find
 these
 groups
 where


people
 are
 discussing
 this
 and
 you
 can


see
 every
 single
 day
 there
 are
 posts


about
 people
 talking
 about
 you
 know
 uh


we
 you
 know
 we
 moved
 to
 somewhere
 where


we
 could
 afford
 a
 home
 more
 easily


during
 COVID
 we
 were
 told
 that
 uh
 you


know
 the
 worst
 case
 scenario
 was
 we


would
 be
 in
 hybrid
 work
 for
 the


foreseeable
 future.
 Um,
 and
 now
 I'm


spending
 5
 days
 a
 week
 uh
 with,
 you


know,
 a
 2-hour
 commute
 each
 way
 and
 I


don't
 see
 my
 kids
 anymore.
 I
 can't
 do


this
 anymore.
 I
 I
 have
 to
 quit.
 Uh
 these


are
 the
 kinds
 of
 things
 that,
 you
 know,


people
 are
 complaining
 about.
 And
 um
 uh


yeah
 uh
 the
 the
 as
 I
 say
 the
 allegation


from
 the
 unions
 is
 that
 this
 is


basically
 uh
 uh
 contrived
 by
 the


government
 to
 shrink
 the
 payroll
 of
 the


public
 sector
 without
 having
 to
 do
 an


explicit
 layoff
 and
 certainly
 without


having
 to
 pay
 severance.


>> Do
 we
 know
 what
 the
 price
 tag
 is
 on
 the


renovation
 for
 the
 McDonald
 block
 now?
 I


mean
 it's
 it's
 got
 to
 be
 approaching
 a


billion
 five
 or
 something
 like
 that.


>> Oh,
 I
 I'm
 sorry.
 I
 actually
 haven't
 seen


uh
 an
 updated
 figure
 on
 that,
 but
 uh
 you


know
 I
 imagine
 because
 it's
 not
 just
 the


McDonald
 block.
 They're
 also
 eventually


going
 to
 move
 MPPPS
 out
 of
 the


legislature
 itself.
 And
 there
 that
 will


also
 be
 a
 very
 substantial
 and
 a
 very


lengthy
 uh
 project.
 I
 I
 mean
 Parliament


Hill
 has
 been
 many
 years
 and
 is
 is
 going


to
 go
 on
 for
 many
 more
 years.
 I
 suspect


the
 legislature
 I
 I
 think
 the
 the
 last


time
 I
 saw
 a
 public
 statement
 was
 that


uh
 they
 were
 projecting
 at
 least
 a


decade
 of
 construction
 and
 it'll
 be
 a


billion.
 No
 doubt
 it'll
 be
 a
 billion


dollars.
 Everything's
 a
 billion
 dollars.


>> I
 mean,
 yeah.
 Is
 there
 a
 public
 works


project
 that
 does
 not
 start
 at
 a
 billion


[laughter]
 dollars?


>> No.
 The
 answer
 to
 that
 is
 no.
 And
 with


that,
 we're
 off
 to
 your
 column,
 my


column.


>> Okay,
 friends.
 You
 know
 how
 this
 works.


We
 call
 this
 segment
 your
 column,
 my


column.
 John
 Michael
 and
 I
 each
 write
 a


column
 for
 tvO.org
 every
 week.
 And
 what


are
 you
 going
 to
 favor
 us
 with
 this


week?


>> Right.
 So,
 this
 is
 a
 local
 item
 from


Burlington,
 but
 it
 has
 provincial


implications
 that
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about.


Uh
 there
 the
 city
 council
 uh
 led
 by
 uh


the
 mayor
 Maryanne
 Me
 Ward,
 who
 is
 also


the
 head
 of
 the
 Ontario
 big
 city
 mayor's


uh
 group.
 They
 are
 considering
 a
 2-year


uh
 elimination
 of
 the
 city's
 development


charges.
 These
 are
 of
 course
 fees
 that


uh
 municipalities
 charge
 to
 help
 uh


defay
 infrastructure
 costs
 under
 the
 uh


principle
 that
 the
 growth
 is
 supposed
 to


pay
 for
 growth.
 Um
 but
 if
 you've
 been


paying
 attention
 to
 this
 podcast


certainly
 you
 know
 that
 development


charges
 are
 also
 considered
 sort
 of


public
 enemy
 number
 one
 in
 terms
 of


housing
 affordability.


>> They
 get
 passed
 on
 to
 the
 home
 buyer,


>> right?
 The
 we
 we
 nominally
 charge


developers
 a
 these
 fees
 to
 help
 pay
 for


sewers
 and
 that
 kind
 of
 thing.
 uh
 in


fact
 the
 the
 costs
 almost
 entirely
 get


passed
 on
 to
 the
 home
 buyer.
 And
 in
 the


case
 of
 the
 GTA,
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of


municipalities
 where
 the
 develop
 the
 the


cumulative
 development
 charges
 uh
 now


are
 well
 in
 excess
 of
 $100,000
 per
 unit.


And
 and
 that's
 just
 tax.
 That's
 before


you
 put
 a
 single
 nail
 in
 to
 a
 single


2x4.
 Right.


>> Burlington
 is
 talking
 about
 eliminating


the
 development
 charges
 for
 a
 period
 of


two
 years.
 And
 it's
 interesting
 because


you
 were
 at
 a
 meeting
 in
 Collingwood,
 I


believe,
 in
 October
 where
 uh
 Mayor
 Maid


Ward
 actually
 was
 very
 skeptical
 of
 the


idea
 of
 cutting
 development
 charges
 and


said
 basically
 uh
 she
 was
 unconvinced
 at


the
 time
 that
 there
 was
 any
 real


evidence
 that
 it
 would
 improve


affordability
 that
 in
 her
 city
 they
 were


approving
 uh
 lots
 of
 homes
 but


developers
 weren't
 building.
 Um,
 so
 this


to
 me
 was
 very
 curious
 and
 so
 I
 spoke


with
 uh
 Mayor
 Mid
 Ward
 and
 asked
 her


like
 what
 what
 changed
 and
 uh
 to
 quote


uh
 John
 Maynard
 Keen
 uh
 you
 know
 when


the
 facts
 changed
 she
 changed
 her
 mind.


What
 do
 you
 do?


>> And
 and
 you
 mentioned
 that
 in
 your


piece.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 and
 the
 the
 in
 particular
 the


facts
 that
 that
 changed
 that
 that
 had


her
 uh
 most
 more
 concerned
 is
 that
 uh


the
 uh
 Canada
 Mortgage
 Housing


Corporation
 which
 does
 regular


projections
 of
 what
 we
 can
 expect
 to
 see


in
 terms
 of
 the
 housing
 sector
 uh
 is
 is


making
 some
 really
 dire
 uh
 predictions


for
 Ontario
 in
 particular
 um
 but
 also


Burlington
 of
 course
 as
 well
 uh
 where
 uh


they
 might
 see
 fewer
 than
 a
 thousand
 new


homes
 built
 this
 year
 if
 they
 don't
 make


some
 kind
 of
 dramatic
 changes.
 Um
 it's


been
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 an
 odd
 journey
 for
 this


particular
 policy
 idea
 through
 uh
 city


council.
 Uh
 they
 were
 initially
 supposed


to
 decide
 yay
 or
 nay
 um
 earlier
 this


month,
 earlier
 in
 February.
 It
 now
 looks


like
 that
 it
 will
 be
 debated
 in
 uh


April,
 I
 believe.
 Um
 and
 uh
 they're


going
 to
 give
 staff
 some
 more
 time
 to


figure
 out
 what
 the
 financial


implications
 of
 this.
 You
 know,
 in


theory,
 if
 this
 were
 a
 normal
 year
 where


you
 were
 talking
 about
 giving
 up


development
 charges
 on
 thousands
 of


units
 that
 might
 be
 built,
 the
 financial


implications
 would
 be
 very
 large
 for
 the


city.
 They'd
 be
 talking
 about
 giving
 up


tens
 of
 millions
 of
 dollars
 in
 revenue.


The
 uh
 problem
 right
 now
 is
 that
 there


are
 no
 homes
 being
 built
 and
 you
 don't


get
 to
 collect
 development
 charges
 on


homes
 that
 don't
 get
 built.
 And
 so


there's
 this
 ambiguous
 question
 of
 of


like
 how
 much
 money
 will
 this
 actually


cost?
 And
 I
 swear
 I'll
 let
 you
 speak
 in


a
 moment.
 [laughter]


But
 uh
 finally,
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 an


issue
 in
 which
 the
 province
 has
 said


they
 want
 to
 see
 municipalities
 doing


things
 exactly
 like
 this.
 And
 there's
 a


a
 broader
 argument
 about
 whether


development
 charges
 were
 ever
 uh
 really


a
 good
 idea
 and
 certainly
 whether
 it
 was


a
 good
 idea
 to
 let
 Ontario


municipalities
 rely
 on
 them
 to
 the


extent
 that
 they
 have.
 Um
 but
 we
 are


where
 we
 are
 and
 municipalities
 like


Burlington
 are
 saying
 like
 we're
 willing


to
 cut
 development
 charges
 but
 we
 need


some
 other
 source
 of
 money
 and


the
 province
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 province


has
 its
 own
 fiscal
 issues
 which
 we'll


talk
 about
 I'm
 I'm
 sure
 as
 we
 get
 closer


to
 budget
 day
 but
 um
 the
 province
 could


easily
 fill
 the
 gap
 for
 a
 city
 like


Burlington.
 uh
 you
 know,
 we're
 talking


about
 at
 most
 a
 few
 tens
 of
 millions
 of


dollars
 and
 uh
 so
 far
 they
 have
 not


gotten
 any
 assurances
 from
 either
 the


province
 or
 the
 feds
 uh
 who
 have
 both


said
 they
 want
 to
 see
 development


charges
 come
 down.
 Um
 they
 have
 gotten


no
 assurances,
 no
 clear
 assurances
 that


that
 money
 will
 be
 uh
 uh
 made
 available


to
 them.


>> I
 interviewed
 Rob
 Flack,
 who
 of
 course


is
 the
 Minister
 of
 Municipal
 Affairs
 and


Housing
 at
 the
 Empire
 Club,
 I
 think
 last


week.
 boy,
 the
 weeks
 they
 just
 uh


sometimes
 they're
 a
 blur.
 But
 I
 think


last
 week
 and
 I
 said
 to
 him,
 "Look,
 you


have
 the
 power
 to
 pass
 a
 law
 prohibiting


development
 charges.
 You
 know,
 if
 if


these
 things
 are
 really
 a
 problem
 to


getting
 housing
 built,
 why
 don't
 you


pass
 a
 law,
 just
 ban
 them
 and
 make
 up


the
 difference,
 you
 know,
 however
 you


make
 up
 the
 difference?"


>> And,
 you
 know,
 it
 is
 obviously
 their


hope
 that
 this
 thing
 will
 all
 work


itself
 out
 in
 the
 wash
 and
 the
 province


doesn't
 have
 to
 come
 in
 like
 the
 heavy


and
 ban
 something
 which
 in
 some
 places


may
 be
 working
 and
 in
 other
 places
 is


not
 working.
 You
 know,
 uh
 who
 else
 has


done
 it?
 Vaughn
 I
 think
 has
 cut
 DCs
 by


50%.
 Missaga
 Peele
 region
 I
 think
 in


general.
 So
 um
 yeah
 so
 this
 is
 there's
 a


great
 debate
 about
 whether
 or
 not
 uh
 it


makes
 more
 sense
 to
 get
 100%
 of
 zero
 or


50%
 of
 something
 you
 know.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 of
 course
 the
 province
 is


looking
 at
 other
 uh
 strategies
 as
 well.


They've
 talked
 about
 broadening
 the
 HST


cut
 on
 new
 homes
 and
 also
 this
 issue


that
 we've
 talked
 about
 before
 on
 the


podcast
 of
 uh
 moving
 the
 costs
 of
 water


and
 sewer
 infrastructure
 into
 these
 uh


specially
 created
 municipal
 corporations


so
 that
 those
 would
 not
 be
 paid
 for
 by


property
 taxes
 anymore.
 Um
 those
 are
 all


ideas
 that
 I
 expect
 we'll
 see
 some


forward
 mo
 movement
 on
 uh
 later
 in
 the


spring.
 Um
 I'm
 quite
 certain
 Minister


Flack
 is
 going
 to
 be
 moving
 the
 ball


forward
 on
 municipal
 service


corporations.
 Yeah.


>> I'm
 not
 sure
 they
 want
 to
 eat
 the
 costs.


>> Well,
 you
 said
 it.
 Budget's
 coming
 up


soon.
 Everybody
 wants
 more
 money.


>> Okay.
 I
 am
 very
 focused
 on
 what
 is
 I


guess
 this
 will
 be
 the
 third
 Liberal


leader
 of
 the
 last
 eight
 years
 who
 will


be
 elected
 uh
 in
 November.
 Uh
 we


remember
 of
 course
 Kathleen
 Wyn
 led
 the


Ontario
 Liberals
 into
 the
 2018
 election.


Steven
 Deluca
 was
 the
 leader
 in
 the
 2022


election,
 Bonnie
 Crombie
 in
 the
 2025


election,
 and
 Doug
 Ford
 beat
 them
 all.


So,
 the
 Ontario
 Liberals
 are
 looking
 for


a
 leader
 again.
 And
 when
 you
 and
 I


gathered
 here
 a
 week
 ago,
 I
 was
 wearing


a
 t-shirt
 with
 David
 Peterson's
 portrait


on
 it
 because
 back
 in
 1982,
 so
 that's
 44


years
 ago.
 44
 years
 ago
 last
 weekend,


the
 Ontario
 Liberals
 picked
 a


38-year-old
 David
 Peterson
 to
 be
 their


leader.
 And
 there
 were
 some
 people


questioning
 at
 the
 time,
 isn't
 that
 a


bit
 young
 to
 be
 leader?
 But
 you
 know


what?
 Three
 years
 later,
 he
 was
 premier


of
 Ontario.
 So,
 for
 whatever
 reason,
 it


worked
 out
 that
 time.
 Liberals
 now
 have


um
 potentially
 the
 opportunity
 to
 pick


somebody
 else
 who
 will
 be
 38
 years
 old


at
 convention
 day
 in
 November.
 And
 his


name
 is
 Rob
 Serjanick.
 And
 I'll
 tell
 you


a
 little
 bit
 about
 him
 because
 I
 suspect


there's
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 who
 haven't


heard
 about
 him.
 He
 is
 the
 member
 of
 the


Ontario
 legislature
 for
 Ajax
 in
 Durham


Region.
 And
 it
 was
 a
 year
 ago,
 actually


a
 year
 ago
 today.
 It
 was
 a
 year
 ago


today,
 Feb
 27,
 when
 Doug
 Ford's
 Tories


were
 winning
 just
 about
 every
 single


seat
 in
 Halton
 region,
 Peele
 region,


York
 Region,
 and
 Durham
 region.
 and
 Rob


Serjanic
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 that
 blue
 wave


took
 one
 of
 those
 seats
 in
 Durham
 region


Ajax
 away
 from
 Patrice
 Barnes
 who
 was


the
 sitting
 member
 for
 the
 progressive


conservatives
 only
 a
 300
 vote
 gap
 out
 of


41,000
 votes
 cast
 so
 don't
 tell
 me
 every


vote
 doesn't
 matter
 every
 vote
 matters


super
 close
 margin
 he
 is
 the
 only


liberal
 MPPP


with
 a
 905
 area
 code
 on
 his
 phone
 all


the
 other
 liberal
 MPPPs
 are
 416ers
 or


613ers


And
 uh
 as
 a
 result,
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


things
 he's
 going
 to
 be
 selling
 is
 the


not
 is
 that
 presuming
 he
 runs,
 he
 wants


to
 run.


>> Yes.


>> Is
 that
 he
 represents
 a
 part
 of
 the


province
 where
 the
 Liberals
 are
 going
 to


have
 to
 be
 better,
 get
 their
 act


together,
 start
 a
 bit
 of
 a,
 you
 know,


plant
 a
 flag
 and
 get
 bigger
 after
 that,


uh
 if
 they're
 ever
 going
 to
 get
 back


into
 power.
 and
 he's
 uh
 if
 he
 can
 raise


the
 money
 going
 to
 put
 himself
 forward


as
 the
 guy
 with
 the
 right
 ideas,
 the


right
 amount
 of
 energy,
 the
 right
 amount


of
 judgment
 and
 ambition
 uh
 to
 even
 at


age
 38
 be
 the
 next
 leader
 of
 the


province.
 He
 does
 have
 a
 really


interesting
 backstory
 and
 I
 won't
 give


it
 away
 here.
 I'll
 just
 encourage


everybody
 to
 go
 to
 tvO.org
 and
 find


Rob's
 picture
 and
 click
 on
 it
 and
 um


that
 will
 tell
 some
 of
 the
 story
 because


he
 has
 an
 unusual
 backstory.
 Uh


reminder,
 the
 leadership
 election
 is
 in


November.
 And
 in
 case
 I
 haven't


complained
 about
 it
 enough,
 it
 will
 not


be
 a
 delegated
 convention.
 It
 will
 be
 a


ranked
 ballot
 where
 people
 will
 vote


once
 and
 that's
 it.
 There
 will
 be
 no
 arm


twisting
 in
 between
 ballots.
 As
 soon
 as


the
 voting
 is
 over,
 they'll
 know
 who


won.
 They'll
 drag
 it
 out
 to
 make
 it
 look


like
 some,
 you
 know,


>> drama


>> drama
 is
 actually
 happening
 when
 it


isn't.
 Um,
 I'm
 not
 sure
 I've
 ever


mentioned
 before
 on
 this
 show
 whether
 or


not
 um
 delegated
 conventions
 are
 a


better
 way
 to
 go
 or
 what
 they
 currently


>> I
 feel
 like
 it
 might
 have
 come
 up
 once


or
 twice.


>> Has
 it
 come
 up
 before?
 Okay.
 I
 I


wouldn't
 want
 to
 overdo
 it,
 but
 um
 yeah,


so
 that'll
 be
 later
 this
 year.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 uh
 just
 a
 few
 things
 about
 uh


Rob
 Serjan.
 A
 I
 first
 met
 him
 when
 he


was
 working
 at
 Toronto
 City
 Hall
 back
 at


the
 beginning
 of
 my
 uh
 journalistic


career
 uh
 when
 I
 was
 covering
 uh
 Toronto


City
 Council.
 Um,
 and
 so
 it's
 been
 very


interesting
 to
 watch
 uh
 his
 career


progress.
 And
 it
 was
 one
 of
 those
 things


where
 on
 election
 night,
 I
 mean,
 there


are
 always
 like
 10,000
 things
 going
 on.


And
 and
 when
 I
 saw
 his
 name,
 you
 know,


win
 a
 seat,
 I
 I
 just
 had
 that
 that


moment
 of
 like,
 wait,
 wait,
 that
 Rob.


Okay.
 Okay.
 I
 just
 need
 need
 to
 take
 it


take
 a
 minute
 [laughter]
 because
 of


where
 he
 won
 and
 and
 and
 you
 know,
 it


was
 not
 the
 most
 expected
 result
 if
 I


could
 put
 it
 that
 way.


>> He
 was
 not
 even
 not
 I
 mean
 the
 election


was
 in
 February.
 in
 January,
 the


Liberals
 had
 no
 candidate
 there.
 They


they
 sort
 of
 threw
 him
 in
 there
 at
 the


very
 last
 minute
 and
 he
 won
 the
 seat.


>> Yeah.
 The
 other
 thing
 I
 will
 say
 uh
 and


actually
 we
 we
 can
 mention
 after
 we


taped
 last
 week's
 episode,
 the
 uh


Liberals
 announced
 that
 uh
 they
 will
 be


having
 an
 open
 nomination
 for
 the


contest
 in
 Scar
 Bro
 Southwest.
 This
 of


course
 is
 the
 writing
 that
 um
 has
 become


a
 bit
 of
 a
 proxy
 battle
 about
 the


leadership
 uh
 fight
 for
 the
 Liberal


Party
 with
 uh
 Nadin
 Smith
 and
 I'm
 sorry,


Kadira
 Jackson
 was
 it?
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Kadira
 Jackson.


>> You
 know
 who
 her
 campaign
 manager
 was,


>> right?
 Yes.


>> Rob
 Serjan
 was
 Kadira
 Jackson's
 campaign


manager
 in
 last
 year's
 election.


>> Um
 but
 uh
 we
 asked
 uh
 we
 the
 reporters


at
 the
 press
 gallery
 uh
 there
 was
 a
 a


press
 conference
 that
 Sjanic
 held
 a
 few


weeks
 ago
 uh
 about
 uh
 Metroinks
 of
 all


things.
 Uh
 but
 we
 asked
 him
 about
 uh
 the


Scar
 Bro
 Southwest
 contest
 and
 uh
 and
 he


I
 I
 want
 to
 give
 him
 full
 credit
 like


you
 know
 he
 he
 said
 from
 the
 outset
 that


the
 only
 reasonable
 choice
 in
 his
 mind


was
 uh
 for
 it
 to
 be
 an
 open
 contest
 that


uh
 despite
 the
 drama
 about
 you
 know
 who


was
 backing
 Nate
 Urskin
 Smith
 who
 let's


you
 know
 make
 this
 clear
 right
 like


Erskin
 Smith
 could
 end
 up
 being
 a


competitor
 to
 Serge
 Janick
 if
 if
 they


both
 end
 up
 running
 um


despite
 that
 he
 was
 very
 clear
 that
 yes


it
 it
 should
 be
 an
 open
 contest.
 This


is,
 you
 know,
 a
 liberal
 in
 good
 standing


has
 the
 right
 to
 run
 in
 any
 nomination


race
 and
 let's
 just
 have
 the
 open


nomination
 and
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 the


the the
 right
 call
 to
 make
 and
 in
 fact


leader
 John
 Fraser
 uh
 did
 actually
 make


that
 call
 and


>> now
 whenever
 that
 election
 is
 called
 uh


we
 will
 uh
 see
 what
 happens.


>> Meaning
 it
 will
 not
 be
 an
 appointed


candidate
 there.
 They
 will
 have
 a


contest
 for
 it.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 we're
 waiting
 for
 the
 premier


to
 call
 the
 bi-election
 uh
 to
 fill
 the


vacancy
 uh
 left
 uh
 by
 the
 uh
 new


Democrat
 uh
 deputy
 leader
 who
 uh


resigned
 and
 then


>> and
 who's
 now
 running
 as
 a
 liberal


>> now
 running
 as
 a
 federal
 liberal
 and
 has


broken
 some
 hearts
 back
 in
 Scarbor


Southwest.
 Um
 and
 once
 that
 election
 is


called
 uh
 or
 I
 guess
 sorry
 there's


nothing
 stopping
 the
 Liberals
 from


holding
 the
 nomination
 uh
 in
 advance
 of


the
 formal
 election
 call,
 but
 it
 will


probably
 be
 um
 uh
 after
 that
 election


call.
 We
 will
 see
 who
 the
 who
 wins
 that


uh
 liberal
 nomination
 and
 if
 it
 is


Natkin
 Smith
 and
 he
 then
 goes
 on
 to
 win


the
 uh
 seat
 in
 the
 actual
 bi-election.


Uh
 many
 people
 see
 that
 as
 uh
 a
 bonus


for
 him
 going
 into
 the
 leadership
 race.


>> Stay
 tuned
 everybody.


>> Okay,
 time
 to
 look
 inside
 our
 mailbag


because
 if
 you've
 got
 a
 burning
 question


or
 insightful
 comment,
 we
 always
 love


hearing
 from
 you
 at
 on
 politics
 at


tvo.org.
 JMM,
 give
 us
 this
 week's.
 Right


here
 we
 have
 a
 comment
 from
 Jude
 Gal
 in


Windsor
 who
 writes,
 "Hello,
 Steve
 and


John
 Michael.
 Although
 this
 is
 not
 the


question
 of
 the
 week,
 I
 want
 to
 thank


you
 for
 OnPaly.
 I
 watch
 it
 regularly
 and


find
 it
 extremely
 helpful
 to
 understand


what
 is
 going
 on
 in
 Ontario.
 In
 this


latest
 episode,
 I
 found
 John
 Michael's


discussion
 of
 online
 gambling
 to
 be
 very


useful
 and
 gave
 me
 ammunition
 to
 write


to
 the
 government
 and
 voice
 my
 concern


about
 this.
 I
 also
 appreciated
 Steve


pointing
 out
 how
 important
 civility
 is


in
 politics.
 Thanks
 again
 for
 this


podcast."
 Jude
 Gal,
 Windsor.


>> Jude,
 that
 is
 a
 wonderful
 note.
 I
 I
 I


should
 clarify
 here
 just
 in
 case
 there's


any
 doubt
 about
 this,
 and
 there


shouldn't
 be.


>> We
 do
 love
 the
 clash
 of
 ideas
 on
 this


show.
 We
 don't
 want
 all
 124
 MPPPs
 down


there
 at
 Queens
 Park
 all
 saying
 and


believing
 and
 thinking
 the
 same
 thing.


Of
 course
 not.
 We
 want
 them
 representing


the
 wide
 variety
 of
 views
 that
 people


hold
 all
 across
 this
 province.
 But
 but


we
 think
 they
 can
 do
 it
 with
 um
 a
 civil


tongue.
 Let's
 just
 put
 it
 that
 way.
 We


think
 they
 can
 do
 it
 with
 some
 civility


without
 practicing
 the
 politics
 of


personal
 destruction
 which
 makes


sensible
 people
 want
 to
 avoid
 politics


like
 the
 plague.
 So
 Jude,
 thank
 you.
 We


are
 glad
 that
 you
 also
 think
 that


civility
 is
 important
 in
 public
 life
 and


that
 that
 issue
 has
 found
 some
 resonance


with
 you
 because
 we
 believe
 in
 it
 too.


>> Yeah,
 you
 know,
 politics
 is
 about


disagreement,
 right?
 And
 and
 they
 are


important
 disagreements.
 People
 should


have
 strong
 feelings
 about
 matters
 that


will
 affect
 their
 lives
 or
 the
 lives
 of


others.
 And
 I
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 um
 uh


drain
 the
 passion
 out
 of
 politics
 and


you
 know
 uh
 uh
 make
 it
 all
 some
 kind
 of


variant
 of
 beige
 where
 as
 you
 [laughter]


say
 we
 we
 we
 don't
 all
 want
 to
 agree
 on


the
 same
 thing
 all
 the
 time.
 Um
 but


yeah,
 fundamentally
 democracy
 is
 about


settling
 the
 arguments
 without
 throwing


punches


>> here.
 here.
 And
 okay,
 just
 before
 we
 go,


we
 wanted
 if
 you're
 listening
 to
 this


Friday
 morning,
 we
 want
 to
 alert
 people,


especially
 those
 of
 you

your

 And
 that
 reminds
 me,
 I
 should
 say


a
 quick
 word
 about
 Red
 Wilson,
 who
 is


the
 dear
 departed
 head
 of
 the
 Wilson


Foundation
 and
 who
 just
 died
 and
 about


whom
 I
 just
 wrote
 a
 column


>> uh
 this
 past
 week
 as
 well.
 Red
 Wilson


was
 a
 legend.
 He
 was
 huge
 in
 the
 history


of
 the
 province
 of
 Ontario.
 started
 as
 a


deputy
 minister
 at
 Queens
 Park,
 worked


his
 way
 up
 to
 being
 a
 captain
 of


industry
 at
 some
 of
 the
 biggest


companies
 in
 this
 country
 and
 gave
 away


a
 hundred
 million
 dollars.
 Wow.


>> To
 worthy
 causes,
 one
 of
 which,
 I'd
 like


to
 add
 was
 us.
 His
 funding
 for
 TVO
 Today


Live
 allowed
 us
 to
 put
 these
 series
 on


for
 I
 think
 we're
 in
 our
 third
 or
 yeah,


third
 year
 now
 of
 doing
 it.
 So,
 Red


Wilson,
 you
 are
 um
 look
 at
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 say
 it.
 You
 were
 loved.
 You


will
 be
 missed.
 And
 um
 thank
 you
 for


everything
 you've
 done
 for
 us,
 for


Ontario,
 and
 for
 Canada.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Amen.
