>> Canada is a hockey nation.
The sport is a source of pride
and shared purpose for millions.
So when the story broke in 2022
that five Canadian World Junior
players had been accused of
sexual assault, the country
itself faced a reckoning.
>> A few years ago.
I had my my son in hockey,
and when I think about
the culture that is
apparently permeating the
highest orders of that
organisation, I can understand
why so many parents, why so
many Canadians who take such
pride in our national winter
sport, are absolutely disgusted
by what's going on.
>> And although the players
were acquitted in July,
concerns about toxic hockey
culture haven't gone away and
new incidents have come to
light.
How can we make sure
young men get the right kind of
guidance and face the right
kind of consequences?
Where are the adults?
In the room, then?
You often hear that sports
builds character, teaches kids
about winning and losing, about
giving something your all.
But how much pressure
is too much pressure?
Can the desire to compete
end up doing more harm
than good for youth?
This is The Rundown.
A content warning for those
watching this interview
contains discussions
of sexual assault.
In May 2022, TSN senior
correspondent Rick Westhead
broke an explosive story.
Five Canada World Junior
players had allegedly sexually
assaulted a young woman
in a London, Ontario, hotel room
in June 2018.
Hockey Canada had kept
the case quiet, and more
stories of assault and violent
hazing have emerged since.
I talked to Westhead
about his new book,
We Breed Lions: Confronting
Canada's Troubled Hockey
Culture and what's changed
and hasn't changed in
the world of junior hockey.
Rick, welcome to our makeshift
studio.
How are you doing?
>> Good.
Great, great.
Glad to join you.
>> I want to talk about how you
started writing about the
problems in hockey culture
in Canada.
This really began with
sort of a phone call.
But tell me, how did that
all come about?
>> It actually kind of began
before that.
So through the summer, spring,
and summer of 2021,
I did a lot of reporting on
an allegation that a player
with the Chicago Blackhawks had
made who said that he'd been
sexually assaulted by one of
the coaches with that team.
And since then,
since October 21st,
there has not been a week
that's gone by in these four
years that I haven't received
a number of credible tips from
people asking me to look into
issues, whether it's sexual
assault or fraud allegations
or maltreatment in sports.
And and this story on
the Hockey Canada lawsuit
started the same way
with somebody giving me a tip
in May 2022 about a lawsuit
that had been filed and settled
quietly in a London, Ontario,
courthouse.
>> For people who aren't
familiar, who haven't been
tuning into the headlines,
give us a little.
I know that case
is wrapped up, but give us
an idea of what that case
sort of started.
>> Well, this case captured
international headlines.
It was where a woman
who was identified
in court documents as M,
alleged that she had been
sexually assaulted by a number
of players with Canada's 2018
World junior hockey team.
She said that she attended
a bar in London, Ontario
and met hockey players
and wound up going back
to have consensual sex
with one of those players.
And she said that
after the fact, the player
invited all the players
on his team to come back
and participate in group sex.
And so the criminal charges
were announced in January
2024 by London police.
And ultimately there was
a trial.
And after a two month trial,
the judge not only acquitted
all five players,
all five co-defendants, but the
judge actually said that she
had found actual consent
in this case as well.
So in one respect,
from a criminal perspective,
these players were acquitted
and in another, the
National Hockey League came out
subsequently and still
condemned what happened, saying
that the behaviour that took
place in that hotel room was
inappropriate and wrong.
>> That's just one case that
you look at throughout this
book.
I want to talk about some
maybe what people have have
said about the book and what
your hopes were.
You wrote that your hope
of this book is not
to tear down the game,
but to make it better.
I am curious,
have you been accused of
trying to tear the game apart?
>> Well, hockey enjoys a
particular place in Canadian
society, doesn't it?
Yeah, and I think
whenever, you know,
Stephen Brunt, great Canadian
journalist, wrote the foreword
for this book and the way he
put it was to critique hockey
is to be anti hockey and to be
anti-hockey is to be
anti-Canadian.
And so when you, you know,
are telling a story
that's an uncomfortable truth,
you're naturally going to get
blowback.
But two things can be true,
right.
You can have a sport
that's so amazing and
still have these systemic
issues that need to be
confronted.
>> I don't want to assume that
everyone is familiar with
hockey who is listening or
watching to this, and there are
people who are unfamiliar with
the junior hockey system in
itself.
For people who don't know,
how does it work?
>> So one of the things I look
at in this book is both the
commercialisation of minor
hockey.
Right.
So we're talking about kids
11, 12, 13 years old
and how that has become a major
industry, but also the junior
system.
And so how that works
is if you are good enough,
you're an elite player, you may
well leave your family home at
the age of 14, 15 or 16 to go
off and play for a junior team,
sometimes hundreds of miles
away from your family.
And this is where, you know,
it's really interesting
talking to players
who've been through this system.
And what they describe is a
situation where you move away
from home.
You're so young and you're
playing on a team with
teammates who are in some
cases 20 or older and adults,
adults.
And you're so desperate
to be accepted because if
you're not accepted, you're an
outlier and no one wants that.
So this is a real situation
where conformity comes into
play.
And again, when you are
so desperate to be accepted,
you know, the players I've
talked to and I interviewed 58
men, 58 who've played junior
hockey, junior A hockey within
the last ten years in Canada.
And they, to a person have said
that while they love the game,
they've identified that there
is these real issues when when
they're so young and have to
move away from home.
>> Your book shares stories not
only of hockey players who are
allegedly perpetrating sexual
assault, but you also write
about players who've been
victims of hazing and abuse,
whether it's by their own peers
or even coaches.
Does this feed each other?
It seems pretty obvious
when you look at it on paper,
when you're reading through
your book that this is
a cyclical problem, but does it
feed into each other?
>> Right?
I mean, isn't it a natural
progression if players
are going to objectify
one another?
Should we be surprised
when there are cases where
they're objectifying young
women?
You know, and there are
a lot of this shocked me.
I'll be honest.
I had not heard in detail
about a lot of these
rites of passages that that
many of these players
have gone through.
One of them are memories.
I have that from reporting this.
I sat in Toronto at a,
at a, at a restaurant
in the, in the West End
near where I live.
And I sat with a young man
in his 20s and his
and the man's father.
And I heard in the player
there in the book, so Marcus
Patterson and his father, Tom
and Marcus Patterson played
junior hockey, junior A hockey
in 2019.
And he told his dad
for the first time about, well,
we were sitting at breakfast
about how when he played junior
A hockey in 2019, he went
through this rite of passage
called the Hot Box.
And for people who don't
know what that is,
he was a rookie on the team
and during a road trip, they
were on the team bus, and all
of the rookies on that team got
called to the back of the team
bus, tapped on the shoulder,
come back again.
They're 10 or 15 feet away
from their coaches.
So begs the question of what
the coaches, whether the
coaches knew what was going on.
But the rookies go to the back
of the bus, they're told to
strip, and then they all are
forced to get into the bathroom
at the back of the bus and
imagine 5 or 6, 16, 17 year old
teenagers jammed in there
without clothes on.
The lights
are turned off, some coins are
thrown in through a vent, and
they're told, you guys can only
come out when you collect $3.25
and change for us.
Well, the joke of it
is there's only $0.95 worth
of coins in there.
So I've heard of anecdotes of
players being in that situation
for upwards of half an hour
or more.
>> I want to talk a little bit
about that age range.
How does it play,
whether the rookies or
they're, you know, they're on
borrowed time at that point
when they're kind of in their
20s, that dynamic.
Because, you know,
those 20 year olds, they
were they were ones who were
16 and went through it.
They may not have an NHL team
that's calling them.
Is there something in that
sort of dynamic there that
plays into it as well?
>> Yeah.
Good question.
I think I think that there
is I think if you're still
playing hockey when you're
20 or 21, the writing's
on the wall that
you're about to have to make
this transition away from being
a junior hockey player
into the real world.
And that might be scary
because all you've done,
all you have identified
yourself as, is a hockey player
forever.
And so, you know, in
some cases, again, from what
I've heard from these, these
young men, you have situations
where 20 year olds have wanted
to take advantage of that and
make sure that these young
players coming up have to go
through the same sorts of
initiations that they had to.
To be fair, I've also heard
stories about, you know,
players who are veterans,
20 who've ensured that that
practice does not continue.
Right, and that there is a
safer environment for these
teenagers coming up playing
junior.
>> All right.
I want to read a quote from
your book that talks about
sort of the culture of silence.
It goes the young men
who once endured or inflicted
harm have not disappeared from
the game.
They are coaches and scouts
and general managers and team
and league executives.
From these perches of influence,
they have too often played a
quiet but pivotal role in
sustaining a culture of silence.
How is this culture of silence
functioned in the hockey world?
>> Well, I can't tell you the
number of times in my
interviews that I heard the
word omerta, you know, like
this and this, this whole
concept that, you know, we
don't talk about the bad things
that we see and that that
that's in junior hockey, it's
in professional hockey.
It even extends down
into minor hockey because
families are petrified
that if they come forward and
they, you know, make a report
even about abuse or
maltreatment, that their
children will be, you know,
who are still hoping to chase
the dream that their kids are
going to be dropped from the
teams and they'll be
blackballed, blacklisted, and
not welcome back on their teams.
I wrote about a story
only in the last couple,
last week or so, about
a case in Ontario where an
under 14 AA hockey team within
the locker room, it was like
Lord of the Flies.
There was a group,
a group discussion where
there were racist and
homophobic and, you know, hate
speech filled passages going on
this group chat.
There were players
holding down their teammates
and pulling down
their their pants and their
underwear and taking photos of
their genitals while other boys
were standing guard by the
doors of the locker room to
make sure that nobody was
coming in.
And in that case,
the coach who again,
the rules of Hockey Canada
are the coaches.
Coaches are supposed to be
in these rooms all the time.
And and I think that case
really does illustrate what
happens when you make a report,
because the, the kind of the
after afterward of that story
is after a family made a
complaint about this and after
there were sanctions, the young
boy who stood up and made the
complaint was assaulted in
another hockey rink, punched
in the face.
And it only came.
That assault only came days
after these sanctions came down.
And that led to another
sanction, where the boy who
punched him in the face was
suspended for a year.
>> I know that, you know,
the book is focussed on hockey,
but is this what is it about it
being?
Is it exclusively a hockey
thing?
Is this happening in AAU,
in other sort of basketball,
whether it's basketball
or other sports?
>> Yeah, and I think that's the
reflex of people within hockey
is to say this isn't just a
hockey problem, it's a societal
problem.
And there's truth in that.
There really is.
Of course, it happens
everywhere, right?
Look at all the stories that
we read about Jeffrey Epstein.
Look at all the stories
that we've read about
Harvey Weinstein that have been
reported.
There have been issues like
this in soccer in England.
There's issues around this
in basketball, in football
in the United States.
But you know what?
There's journalism about it
as well.
And these stories are
documented.
They're told,
there's accountability
issues that are reported on.
And so to me the question is
why wouldn't we report on it
in Canada about hockey.
>> If former players are
working their way into
leadership positions that we
are seeing, how do we break
that cycle?
>> Well, I think there is some
optimism to be found too,
and there are efforts and I
document them in this book
about programs that are trying
to do this differently.
So for one example,
in Hamilton, Ontario,
the AA Hamilton Steel
and AA Hamilton Huskies have
bought into this program that
started in the United States.
It's called Coaching Boys Into
Men.
And so I went down.
And the way this works
this season, they have
16 teams in Hamilton that are
running this program.
So all the coaches are taught
about how to speak to their
players, about issues of
consent, about what healthy
masculinity looks like, how
they should treat each other,
how they should treat, you know,
young women.
And I actually sat in
and watched these modules.
I watched the coaches
talk to boys 11 and 12
years old about these issues.
And I wondered,
where are the boys hearing
these kinds of messages?
Of course, parents should be
talking to their kids about
this.
But, you know, I know
just through my interviews and
through asking people, a lot of
people are uncomfortable.
And these kinds of conversations
they should be having with
their kids are not happening.
Are they happening in schools?
Certainly not always.
And so maybe moving forward,
the reason for optimism here
is if word about programs
like this get off the ground
and spread.
Maybe hockey can be a place
where we're actually as
concerned about grooming young
men of character as we are of
grooming young men who can play
hockey really well.
>> Rick, we're going to leave
it there, really appreciate it,
and really appreciate your
thoughtful reporting.
>> Thank you.
>> Sports is filled with
motivational sayings.
Give it 110%.
No pain, no gain.
But what do they sound like
to a kid who's under pressure
to succeed?
When does competition
stop being healthy and start
being a cause of stress
and distress?
I asked Perdita Felicia,
world champion hurdler,
broadcaster and author of
My Mother's Daughter, and Andrew
Wong, a clinical psychologist
who works with kids, teens,
and adults.
About this and more.
Perdita.
Andrew, welcome to The Rundown.
How are you two doing?
>> Good.
>> Great.
Thank you.
>> All right, Perdita,
I'm coming to you first.
You competed at the highest
level.
What would you say that
competition motivated you
as a young person?
>> You know what I would say?
For me, I loved the social
aspect of sport.
And that's what you find.
If you look at data,
like, young girls love
the social aspect of sports,
whereas boys like their
motivation for sports is really
like how far they can push
and test themselves.
I'm talking about like
before the age of 14
as I got older, right?
Because I was honestly like
something I could take or leave.
But as I got older,
it wasn't till I was like 16,
17, 18, 19 then like,
oh yeah, like, I really love
doing this, but I really did it
because all my friends were
doing it, to be honest.
>> What were they doing?
What were we what were
we competing in.
>> Yeah.
So oh my goodness everything.
Like I tried out for
cross country in grade three.
That was an absolute fail.
Don't recommend if you like.
Have a lot of like fast
twitch fibres.
And then I did
triple jump was horribly
like awfully coordinated.
I know it seems like
it doesn't make sense further,
but I couldn't do
the hop skip jump part.
Long jump was really good at it.
Even tried high jump and I'm
not that tall.
I'm like five-five,
but I got like third place
in the region and work on
my résumé as like an emerging
athlete, just to say,
like I did everything because
it was cool and my friends
were doing it.
And then, you know,
I had I got to the hurdles,
didn't want to do it at all.
And my coach made me
do the hurdles.
He would only coach me
in hurdles.
And that's how I became
a very reluctant hurdler.
>> Okay, there we go.
All right.
Well, Andrew, it's not just
sports.
>> Of course.
We know in school
there is competition
if you have siblings.
I have an older brother.
We there is an internal
competition right there
in itself.
How can a competitive
atmosphere affect young people?
>> Well, I think I think you
hit it on the on the nail
on the head there.
Nature has this built-in
mechanism called siblings.
And they promote this
healthy competition.
Or they can and I think
just like in sports,
sometimes you need
the referees who come in.
And for siblings
it's the parents.
And I think when it comes to
siblings, what is so important
to understand is that they will
push each other right.
But at the same time,
what we hope to see is
this sort of healthy
problem solving as well,
that there will be laughter and
there will be problem solving,
and they sort of work things
out.
And from time to time,
parents will hop in and say,
okay, I'm gonna have to help
you guys problem solve a little
bit.
But this is where I do
believe, and the research has
shown that those who form these
positive sibling relationships
can go out there and form these
positive relationships in sport,
just like Perdita was saying,
you know, the social aspect is
so important.
>> All right, Perdita, you are
a parent.
Shout out to six and
a half year old Nova.
Knowing how much pressure
you were under
through your life as an
athlete, would you want to see
your own child deal with that
kind of pressure?
>> You know, that's a good
question, and thank you for
putting the half on the six and
a half.
That's very important
to Nova.
I will say that we've
thrown her in everything like
swimming, you know, tennis,
figure skating.
She's done all the things.
And it actually
when she was around five, she I
think she heard someone saying
that she's like, mama,
I'm just a child.
I'm doing too many things.
And I was like, oh,
he's like, kind of wanted.
I know.
I was like, oh, I kind of
want her to have all the things
and the experiences I didn't
have because I kind of just,
you know, did track.
It was something
I could afford.
So about the pressure piece,
little Nova probably feel some
of that and actually pared it
back.
She's just doing swimming
right now and figure skating
and that's enough.
The two things she loves.
But I will say this
the pressure has to be
age appropriate right now.
What I don't like seeing
is the fact that, you know,
you see these these
young athletes, nine, eight,
14, it's like it's become
a professionalisation of
youth sport.
They have the nutritionist
and the coaches.
And I actually think
that's unhealthy.
It can lead to burnout.
It also can lead to them
not really doing it for
them doing it to like please
a coach or please a parent.
I think parents
and all of us who
have littles around us need to
kind of keep an eye on that.
Are we doing it for us or is it
really about them and their
enjoyment?
>> All right, Andrew, I'm going
to get you to pick up on what
Perdita said there, but help us
understand what's the
difference between healthy
and unhealthy competition?
>> Healthy competition.
It's so important to focus on
the effort to focus on the skill
development, the positive
reinforcements of praise
and celebrating the relative
achievement of that child.
I think so many times, I mean,
it's built into to human nature.
We will compare.
I get parents in my office
all the time saying,
oh, I wish I didn't
compare, but I do.
And I always remind them, we do,
we compare and that's okay.
But we have to be aware of that.
And is it a healthy comparison
or not.
Right.
And so when we talk about
healthy competition,
it's knowing that, okay,
we are going to celebrate
that relative achievement.
If they've never jumped
an axle with foreign figure
skating and this is the
first time we celebrate,
that doesn't matter
if you know, another child
on the other side of the rink
is doing a double axel, right?
It doesn't matter.
And then with
unhealthy competition,
the piece around that, there's
just so much emphasis on
winning and losing.
And I think nowadays
there's so many different
levels of competition.
Like Perdido is saying,
I mean, you can have a six
year old who is being chosen
for, you know, a single,
a team, a double, a team
in hockey.
And what does that even mean
to the child?
And so when we go into that
level, it becomes problematic
because now we're just
emphasising winning and losing.
We have to emphasise the fun
and the learning and the skill
development.
You know, sometimes when we
put too much pressure on kids,
we emphasise, oh, you did this
wrong, you did that wrong.
You have to do this better.
And we indirectly produce
this notion of shame.
And so when they be, when they
feel shame, now they're scared
of making mistakes.
Now they're only playing,
as Perdita mentioned before,
to please the coach,
to please the parent,
you know.
Oh, I scored three goals.
I'm going to get praised
today.
I didn't score any goals
that that's going to be
a tough one.
On the car ride home.
>> Perdita, I want to get your
take.
What do you think the
difference is between healthy
and unhealthy competition?
>> You know, I've been through,
like, every level of sport,
grassroots, emerging, elite,
professional with my job for
a long time.
And I have seen some coaches
that have been the reason
that athletes can excel.
So I'll give you a quick,
quick understanding.
I had a a world class
and elite training partner
for a really long time,
and so I competed for Canada.
I won't say her name.
She competed for another
country,
but so we were in university.
She'd do great and then she'd
go back for the professional
season, let's say Olympics
or worlds.
We go back and so.
So I'd see her, you know, we
weren't at camps, but we'd be
like, let's say the Olympics,
the World Championships,
wherever they were that year.
And she could not get it
together.
Like she wouldn't
even make a final.
And it was so confusing to me.
And I remember asking my coach,
like, why is it when she
goes back home,
like she doesn't perform?
And it came down to her coach
being so high strung, so
stressful yelling at her that
her ability to perform
under pressure was low.
And so you see those unhealthy
environments when an athlete
really can't normalise, failure
is not allowed to fail.
If you see your young emerging
athlete looking over at you
as the parent or looking at you
as the coach for confirmation,
if they should move,
they should make this play.
Should I, you know,
ask to come off the field.
Those are the things that are
starting to really become
unhealthy because that child's
not able to make decisions for
themselves.
You want, like Andrew said,
to have this environment
where you know, the child
feels free, they're enjoying
themselves.
It's fun.
And the other thing I want to
stress, and I'll say this is we
have to normalise mistakes,
right?
You have to normalise.
And people hate this word.
I love this word failure.
It's okay.
And instead of saying to
your child nitpicking and
analysing, just say, oh my
goodness, it was great to see
what you did today.
You know, whenever
Nova comes off the ice,
you know she's not a great
skater yet, but I have dreams
of her maybe, you know, being
a prolific figure skater,
I'm projecting, I'm projecting.
But the point I'm trying to
say is, once she gets off
the ice, I ask her,
like, how did it feel?
It looked great, I love it,
I can't skate, but you're six
and a half and you can.
So I think you have to
really check yourself
as the parent and the coach
and then make sure that child
is really doing it
for the right reasons.
>> All right.
Andrew, Perdita had mentioned
the commercialisation of sports.
Sports has grown so much.
Do you think parents are feeling
pressured to put their kids in
competitive sports, or grab
that camera to film that
highlight reel to post on
YouTube?
So the scouts are watching
because we know scouts
are watching.
But do parents feel
that pressure?
>> Oh my goodness.
Absolutely.
So just some self-disclosure.
I have a seven year old and a
nine year old, and the nine
year old is a figure skater
as well.
And even she sometimes asks,
hey, did my club put that
video of me out there?
Right?
And then you have my seven year
old who wanted to try out
for select baseball.
And so, yeah, there's
a lot of commercialisation.
That's a huge part of it
nowadays, I think.
Yeah, money is a factor.
Every club, every league wants
to generate profit.
And so you have, like I said
before, like four different
levels of hockey,
four different levels
of baseball.
And everybody is
trying to recruit.
So I do think that's a
that's a huge factor.
Plus social media too.
>> All right.
In the last few
minutes that we have Perdita,
do you have any advice to share
for youth or the adults in the
room on how to maintain your
self-worth during the ups and
downs of winning and losing?
>> I love that question.
I think that you have to
diversify your child's
identities.
And so if the only focus
in the household is them
being a hockey grade, a hockey
star and having the rink and
whatever the arena of play is,
I think you do your child
a disadvantage.
Because here's
the truth majority of the human
population does not go to the
Olympics, does not go and win
a Stanley Stanley Cup.
Sorry to break it to you
moms and dads spending
all these thousands of
dollars on these things.
Do it.
Love the development idea of it.
But the point is, if that is
the goal, that's the idea.
No.
So I think you really have to
check yourself and be like, no,
I'm doing this because there
are things my athlete is going
to learn from sport that will
serve them forever.
And there's things I remember
learning from, you know,
when I was nine in club track
and then when I was, you know,
18 in university
where it's like,
now I'm accountable.
If I say I'm going
to do something, I say it.
Also, when I've not worked out
for a long time,
I can get back on a treadmill
and do it again.
These are just the effort.
It's like me able to do things
and try hard to be uncomfortable
are lifelong lessons.
I don't have all these,
you know, medals hanging around,
but well, actually I do.
Sorry, not everybody has
all these medals hanging around
is what I meant to say, right?
But the point is,
what is what's more lasting
than these rusty, dusty medals
is really those kind of the
intrinsic motivation I have to
grow myself and to be better.
And so that really has to be
why you do it as a parent.
And just make sure at the end of
the day, that you're not
projecting what you want
on your for yourself
onto your child.
Let them have their own
goals and their own dreams.
And if, yeah, they go on to be
the next Sidney Crosby
or the next Perdita Felicien.
Touché, Amber Morely.
Yes, great.
But just do it.
Just do it for them.
>> Andrew, that, you know, a
lot of people have a hard time
with the phrase, you know,
winning isn't everything.
Adults, youth, parents,
whatever it be.
How can parents help their kids
figure this one out?
>> I think first and foremost,
let them play.
Let them enjoy themselves
out there.
You know, this this idea
that, you know, winning
isn't everything.
It's true.
Going back to what Perdita
was saying, sorry, it's being
able to build resilience
throughout their lives.
Take what they can learn
from sport into everyday life.
Resilience.
What is resilience, right.
It's the ability
to be able to say,
I can do hard things.
I can ask for help.
Some of the athletes
who I work with, they are so
scared to ask for help because
they think they have to do it
on their own.
But research has shown
that resilience is built
on being able to be resourceful
and to ask for help.
So that also means that
they can be vulnerable
to others and trust others
that they know better.
And so being able to take that
away through sport, I love
sports because it teaches
so much about life.
So when they go out
into the work world, you
know, can they ask for help
instead of trying to figure
things out on their own?
I hope they can.
>> All right.
We are going to leave it there.
Andrew, Perdita, thank you
so much.
Lessons not just for the
young ones, but for the adults
as well.
Really appreciate it anytime.
>> Thank you so much.
>> Creating a new show
is an opportunity
and we want your help.
