Hello
 my
 friends.
 Today
 is
 January
 28th


and
 this
 is
 my
 January
 FOMC
 debrief.
 Now


the
 press
 conference
 just
 ended
 and
 it


really
 was
 as
 boring
 as
 expected.
 But


before
 we
 talk
 about
 what
 happened


today,
 let's
 level
 set
 a
 little
 bit.
 Now


the
 last
 time
 we
 had
 a
 meeting
 was
 in


December
 and
 the
 FOMC
 did
 cut
 rates.
 Now


between
 then
 and
 now
 you
 know
 data
 has


come
 in
 basically
 okay.
 I
 mean
 job
 mark


job
 growth
 is
 okay.
 Um
 seems
 like
 we


have
 some
 improvements
 in
 surveys
 and
 uh


inflation
 was
 okay
 as
 well
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 I
 mean
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day
 we're


basically
 where
 we
 were
 uh
 just
 uh
 last


month.
 Economy
 is
 low
 low
 higher
 low


fire.
 Inflation
 is
 a
 bit
 above
 2%.
 Now


heading
 into
 today's
 meeting
 there
 was


widespread
 expectation
 that
 nothing


would
 happen.
 the
 market
 was
 pricing
 in


0%
 chance
 basically
 of
 any
 uh
 rate
 cut.


So
 what
 I
 was
 most
 interested
 in
 hearing


about
 in
 this
 meeting
 was
 what
 chair


Powell's
 plans
 were
 for
 when
 his


chairmanship
 ends
 in
 May.


Now
 when
 you
 are
 a
 Fed
 chair
 and
 your
 uh


chairmanship
 ends
 historically
 speaking


you
 resign
 from
 the
 Fed
 and
 then
 the


president
 gets
 to
 appoint
 someone
 else.


For
 Cher
 Powell
 though,
 you
 know,
 his


term
 as
 governor,
 so
 if
 he
 stepped
 down


from
 chair,
 he
 would
 be
 a
 normal


governor.
 Doesn't
 end
 until
 a
 few
 years


later.
 So,
 he
 has
 the
 option
 of
 staying


on.
 It
 would
 be
 rare.
 I
 mean,
 it's


happened
 before,
 but
 it
 it
 would
 be


uncommon.
 He's
 been
 closely
 guarded


about
 his
 uh
 his
 plans.
 And
 of
 course,


if
 he
 were
 to
 resign,
 then
 the
 President


Trump
 would
 be
 able
 to
 appoint
 a
 new


governor.
 So
 you
 would
 have
 a
 I
 guess
 a


more
 politicized
 Fed.
 So
 in
 any
 case,


today's
 uh
 first
 starting
 with
 the


statement.
 Now
 the
 statement
 just
 modest


upgrades
 into
 the
 economic
 outlook.


That's
 that's
 true.
 Uh
 what
 was
 most


interesting
 to
 me
 was
 that
 we
 actually


had
 two
 descents.
 One
 from
 Governor


Waller.
 I
 think
 that
 was
 very


surprising.
 Governor
 Waller
 we
 think
 of


as
 more
 of
 a
 centrist


governor.
 However,
 he
 is
 one
 of
 the


candidates
 to
 be
 fed
 chair
 and
 of


course,
 you
 know,
 you
 only
 get
 one
 shot


at
 being
 fed
 chair.
 So,
 I
 think
 it's


totally
 understandable
 if
 he
 if
 he
 were


to,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 descent
 a
 little
 bit


to
 improve
 his
 chances.
 I
 think
 we
 would


all
 do
 the
 same.
 The
 second
 descent
 was


Governor
 Myron.
 Now,
 Governor
 Myron,


we've
 been
 seeing
 him
 descent
 some
 time.


Um,
 so
 that
 was
 expected.
 What
 was
 a


little
 bit
 different
 now,
 though,
 is


that
 in
 the
 past,
 Governor
 Myron
 has


dissented
 and
 called
 for
 50
 basis


points.
 This
 time
 he's
 just
 dissenting


and
 calling
 for
 25
 basis
 point
 cut


instead.
 So
 it
 looks
 like
 he
 is


moderating
 his
 stance.
 That's
 probably


going
 to
 make
 him
 bit
 more
 persuasive


when
 he
 talks
 to
 other
 people
 at
 the


Fed.
 He
 won't
 seem
 like
 such
 an
 outlier.


Now
 moving
 on
 to
 the
 press
 conference.


So
 yeah,
 it's
 not
 much
 going
 on
 really.


Just
 um
 Cher
 Powell
 was
 asked
 explicitly


whether
 or
 not
 he
 would
 what
 his
 plans


were
 after
 his
 chairmanship
 ends.
 And


you
 know,
 he's
 still
 not
 really


revealing
 that.
 That's
 kind
 of
 a
 big


Trump
 card
 he
 holds.
 If
 he
 were
 to
 stay,


he
 would
 very
 much
 be
 a
 shadowfed
 chair


and
 be
 able
 to
 uh
 I
 think
 still
 wield


significant
 influence
 over
 how
 the
 rest


of
 the
 would
 uh
 would
 view.
 So
 we
 don't


get
 any
 information
 on
 that
 at
 the


moment.
 I
 think
 the
 most
 interesting


things
 that
 came
 up
 during
 the
 press


conference
 were
 one
 about
 questions


about
 uh
 whether
 or
 not
 foreign


investors
 are
 hedging
 their
 dollar


exposure.
 So
 remember
 last
 year,
 last


April,
 we
 had
 a
 big
 sell
 America
 trade.


The
 dollar's
 weakened
 significantly
 and


the
 past
 week
 it's
 been
 weakening
 again


in
 the
 aftershocks
 of
 uh


of
 the
 Davos
 escalation
 there.
 So
 the


BIS
 had
 a
 p
 research
 piece
 out
 a
 few


months
 ago
 or
 maybe
 oh
 sometime
 last


year
 saying
 that
 you
 know
 foreigners
 are


still
 holding
 US
 assets
 they're
 just


hedging
 their
 dollar
 exposure.
 Now
 that


has
 always
 been
 very
 suspect
 to
 me


because
 when
 you
 hedge
 your
 dollar


exposure
 and
 everyone
 is
 if
 when


everyone
 is
 jumping
 to
 hedge
 it
 you
 will


see
 that
 in
 pricing
 through
 the
 FX
 swap


basis
 it
 would
 become
 more
 negative.
 But


as
 I've
 commented
 before
 on
 on
 Twitter,


you
 know,
 if
 everyone
 was
 hedging,
 then


why
 is
 the
 FX
 swap
 basis
 basically
 not


very
 negative,
 actually
 sometimes


positive.
 So
 that's
 just
 a
 story
 that


you
 got
 to
 respect
 what
 the
 BIS
 is


putting
 in.
 I
 actually
 think
 they
 do


really
 good
 work,
 but
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 be


consistent
 with
 the
 market
 pricing.
 And


when
 asked
 about
 that
 today,
 Chairp


basically
 said
 he
 doesn't
 like
 he


doesn't
 really
 see
 people
 hedging
 their


dollar
 exposure.


So
 um
 uh
 that
 that
 was
 I
 think
 an
 really


interestingformational
 tidbit
 and
 from


the
 aggregate
 u
 fund
 of
 fundflow
 data


it's
 really
 obvious
 that
 foreign


investors
 continue
 to
 pour
 into
 dollar


assets.
 Now
 the
 second
 thing
 I
 think


that
 I
 found
 interesting
 is
 more
 of
 the


topic
 duour
 which
 is
 cha
 was
 asked
 about


what
 he
 thought
 about
 these
 surging
 gold


prices.
 Here's
 what
 he
 said.
 As
 I'm
 sure


you've
 noticed,
 gold
 and
 silver
 prices


have
 experienced
 historic
 gains
 of
 late.


And
 I'm
 wondering
 how
 much
 attention,
 if


any,
 you
 pay
 to
 those
 moves
 and
 and
 what


message
 you
 may
 take
 from
 these
 uh


significant
 price
 increases
 we've
 seen


for
 precious
 metals.
 Don't
 don't
 take


much
 message
 macroeconomically.
 Um
 the


argument
 can
 be
 made
 it's,
 you
 know,


that
 we're
 losing
 credibility
 or


something.
 It's
 simply
 not
 the
 case.
 If


you
 look
 if
 you
 look
 at
 where
 inflation


expectations
 are,
 our
 credibility
 is


right
 where
 it
 needs
 to
 be.
 So
 we
 look


at
 those
 things.
 We
 don't
 we
 don't
 get


spun
 up
 over
 particular
 asset
 price


changes.
 Although
 we
 do
 we
 do
 monitor


them,
 of
 course.
 Now
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 as


someone
 who
 used
 to
 work
 at
 the
 Fed


thoroughly
 doesn't
 care
 about
 gold


prices.
 For
 them
 gold
 is
 really
 they're


you
 know
 they're
 mostly
 standard
 PhD


economists.
 So
 they
 think
 of
 gold
 as
 you


know
 it's
 just
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 barbarous


relic
 as
 Kane
 would
 say.
 It's
 not


something
 that
 really
 says
 anything.
 Now


he
 also
 directly
 addresses
 the
 claim


that
 this
 is
 some
 sort
 of
 loss
 of


confidence
 debasement
 and
 so
 forth.
 But


again
 if
 this
 were
 true
 then
 you
 would


expect
 inflation
 expectations
 to
 be


rising
 right
 in
 a
 fiat
 currency
 regime.


Debbacement
 means
 inflation.
 It
 means


that
 your
 currency
 is
 able
 to
 buy
 fewer


goods
 and
 services.
 But
 if
 you
 look
 at


uh
 what
 the
 market
 traded
 at
 inflation


break
 evens
 are
 implying,
 you
 just
 don't


really
 see
 that.
 So
 uh
 I
 continue
 to


think
 that
 what
 you're
 really
 seeing
 is


just
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 momentum
 chasing
 a
 lot


of
 uh
 people
 the
 same
 people
 who've
 been


buying
 NFTTS,
 meme
 coins,
 and
 so
 forth.


They're
 still
 around
 and
 they're
 still


kind
 of
 kind
 of
 uh
 speculating.


I
 will
 also
 note
 though
 that
 there
 are


uh
 heightened
 Iran
 war
 headlines
 and
 so


that
 could
 be
 impacting
 this
 as
 well.


All
 right.
 So,
 overall
 pretty


uneventful.
 For
 the
 next
 move
 in


monetary
 policy,
 I
 think
 we
 really
 need


to
 pay
 attention
 to
 the
 White
 House


because,
 you
 know,
 any
 moment
 now,
 as


they've
 been
 saying
 for
 some
 time,
 they


could
 announce
 the
 next
 Fed
 chair.
 All


right,
 talk
 to
 you
 all
 this
 weekend.
