There's
 mention
 of
 Greenland
 being


invaded
 by
 the
 United
 States.
 There's


the
 situation
 in
 Iran.
 Trump
 has


snatched
 Maduro
 from
 Venezuela.
 There's


talk
 of
 China
 taking
 back
 Taiwan.
 What


the
 hell
 is
 going
 on?


>> Well,
 what
 you're
 seeing
 is
 the
 West


becoming
 weaker
 and
 embolding
 our


enemies
 and
 the
 final
 collapse
 of
 a


shared
 myth
 that
 we
 were
 living
 in
 a


structured
 world
 where
 everything
 is


done
 according
 to
 the
 rules.
 That
 is
 now


gone.
 And
 Trump
 is
 acting
 in
 recognition


of
 that
 reality,
 saying
 we
 are
 not
 going


to
 play
 by
 the
 fake
 rules
 anymore
 that


no
 one
 else
 is
 playing
 by.
 Anyway,


>> is
 there
 a
 risk
 with
 this
 strategy?


>> Of
 course.
 And
 we
 can
 talk
 about
 the


reasons
 for
 it.
 I
 think
 it's
 really


important.


>> The
 floor
 is
 yours.


>> Constantine
 Kissen
 is
 one
 of
 the


sharpest
 voices
 in
 political
 commentary


right
 now.


>> He's
 here
 to
 unpack
 the
 current


geopolitical
 landscape
 and
 what
 could
 be


done
 to
 salvage
 the
 West
 before
 it's
 too


late.


>> So,
 Russia
 invading
 Ukraine
 was
 not
 an


accident.
 It
 was
 a
 consequence
 of
 the


fact
 that
 Putin
 felt
 this
 was
 the
 moment


to
 test
 the
 waters.
 Can
 we
 now
 do
 the


things
 we've
 always
 wanted
 to
 do?


Because
 the
 West
 lost
 its
 focus
 and


sense
 of
 purpose.
 So,
 for
 example,
 I


don't
 know if
 you
 know
 this,
 Europe
 is


12%
 of
 the
 world's
 population,
 25%
 of


the
 world's
 GDP,
 and
 60%
 of
 the
 world's


welfare
 spending.
 Germany
 destroyed
 its


nuclear
 facilities,
 thereby
 making


itself
 reliant
 on
 Russian
 gas.
 And
 in


Britain,
 we've
 destroyed
 our


manufacturing,
 which
 is
 now
 produced


elsewhere.
 and
 we've
 run
 down
 our
 armed


forces
 because
 we
 have
 felt
 so
 safe
 and


so
 comfortable
 because
 there's
 been
 no


consequence.
 Well,
 the
 consequences
 are


here
 per
 person.
 We
 have
 less
 money


today
 than
 we
 did
 20
 years
 ago.
 We
 have


the
 highest
 tax
 burden
 in
 peace
 time


history.
 We're
 driving
 out
 the


entrepreneurs
 and
 we've
 already
 seen
 a


decline
 in
 our
 power
 in
 the
 world
 and


our
 influence
 in
 the
 world.
 That's
 the


big
 danger.
 But
 there
 is
 an
 opportunity


to
 turn
 things
 around
 if
 we
 can
 make


these
 big
 decisions.
 What
 are
 you


hopeful?


>> Listen,
 my
 my
 team
 gave
 me
 a
 script
 that


they
 asked
 me
 to
 read,
 but
 I'm
 just

There
 is
 so
 much
 going
 on
 in
 the
 world


right
 now
 that
 it
 is
 incredibly


confusing
 to
 somebody
 like
 me
 who


doesn't
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 thinking


about
 geopolitics
 or
 the
 bigger
 picture.


I'm
 very
 very
 heads
 downstand
 as
 I


imagine
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 in
 my
 audience


are.
 We
 kind
 of
 get
 on
 with
 our
 lives.


But
 every
 time
 we
 look
 up
 at
 the
 news,


there's
 Trump
 has
 snatched
 Maduro
 from


Venezuela.
 There's
 the
 war
 with
 Russia


and
 Ukraine.
 There's
 something
 going
 on


with
 Iran.
 There's
 mention
 of
 Greenland


being
 invaded
 by
 the
 United
 States.


There's
 talk
 of
 China
 taking
 back


Taiwan.
 I
 wanted
 to
 speak
 to
 you
 today


to
 understand
 your
 perspective
 on
 the


bigger
 picture
 here.


>> What
 the
 hell
 is
 going
 on?


Well,
 what
 you're
 seeing
 is
 the
 the


final
 collapse
 of
 what
 people
 have


described
 as
 the
 postworld
 war
 II
 order,


which
 then
 became
 the
 post
 Soviet


collapse
 order.
 So,
 if
 you
 think
 about


1945,
 World
 War
 II
 finishes
 and
 the
 Cold


War
 begins.
 So,
 you
 go
 from
 World
 War
 II


to
 two
 big
 major
 players
 in
 the
 world


competing
 for
 dominance.
 And
 that
 lasts


until
 1991
 when
 the
 Soviet
 Union


collapses
 at
 which
 point
 you
 get
 the


uniolar
 world
 in
 which
 there's
 only
 one


hedgeimonyy,
 only
 one
 country
 that's


really
 setting
 the
 terms
 of
 what's


happening
 in
 the
 world.
 The
 west
 lost


its
 focus
 and
 its
 sense
 of
 purpose
 in


1991
 because
 we
 were
 like,
 well,
 we
 we


defeated
 our
 great
 rival,
 communism,


Soviet,
 Russia,
 etc.
 And
 then
 we
 kind
 of


didn't
 really
 know
 what
 to
 do
 and
 we


took
 eye
 off
 the
 ball.
 And
 what's


happening
 now
 is
 that
 entire
 framework


that
 we
 have
 had
 since
 World
 War
 II
 is


disintegrating
 very
 rapidly.
 This
 is
 why


you
 know
 in
 in
 light
 of
 recent
 events


and
 the
 the
 Maduro
 situation
 you
 hear
 a


lot
 of
 people
 talk
 about
 international


law.
 International
 law
 was
 I
 don't
 know


if
 you
 if
 you
 ever
 had
 you
 will
 know


Harrari
 on
 your
 show.
 I
 have
 yet
 to


wrote
 the
 book
 book
 called
 Sapiens
 in


which
 he
 talks
 about
 the
 fact
 that


almost
 everything
 that
 we
 live
 in
 the


world
 in
 in
 which
 we
 exist
 is
 a
 kind
 of


shared
 myth
 that
 we
 have
 and
 laws
 and


money
 and
 all
 these
 things.
 They
 are


agreements
 that
 we
 have
 between
 us
 to


make
 things
 real
 that
 are
 not
 real.


Money
 isn't
 real.
 That
 piece
 of
 paper


has
 no
 value
 in
 your
 pocket
 really


outside
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 other
 people


have
 got
 together
 and
 agreed
 that
 it's


money.
 Right.
 Well,
 international
 law


really
 was
 that,
 but
 even
 weaker
 than


that.
 Because
 if
 you
 think
 about
 what
 a


law
 is,
 a
 law
 is
 something
 that
 has
 to


be
 backed
 by
 not
 only
 the
 consent
 of
 the


people
 who
 are
 involved,
 but
 also


ultimately
 it's
 about
 the
 use
 of
 force,


the
 legitimate
 use
 of
 force.
 Now,
 for


international
 law,
 there's
 never
 been


anything
 that
 could
 enforce
 that
 law


other
 than
 the
 most
 powerful
 country
 in


the
 world,
 right?
 So
 if
 China
 invades


Taiwan,
 no
 one's
 going
 to
 do
 anything


about
 it
 because
 there
 is
 no
 overarching


authority
 with
 the
 military
 to
 be
 able


to
 do
 anything
 about
 it.
 And
 so
 that


shared
 fiction
 that
 we
 had
 which
 we
 were


living
 in
 a
 structured
 world
 in
 which


everything
 is
 done
 according
 to
 the


rules,
 the
 rules-based
 order.
 You
 might


have
 heard
 that
 term
 being
 used.
 That
 is


now
 gone.
 And
 Trump
 is
 acting
 in


recognition
 of
 that
 reality.
 and
 he's


saying,
 well,
 given
 that
 it's
 sort
 of


every
 man
 for
 himself
 now,
 I'm
 going
 to


do
 what's
 in
 the
 interest
 of
 the
 United


States.
 Is
 it
 in
 the
 interest
 of
 the


United
 States,
 for
 example,
 to
 have
 an


openly
 hostile
 leader
 of
 a
 country
 close


to
 the
 US,
 which
 is
 so
 destabilized
 that


7
 million
 people
 have
 fled
 as
 refugees?


>> Venezuela.


>> Venezuela.
 Is
 it
 in
 our
 interest
 to
 have


this
 person
 cozying
 up
 to
 Russia
 and


China?
 Is
 it
 in
 our
 interest
 to
 allow


him
 to
 have
 Hezbollah
 training
 camps
 on


the
 island
 of
 Margarita?
 Is
 it
 in
 our


interest?
 It's
 going
 back
 to
 the
 Monroy


doctrine,
 the
 idea
 that
 America
 does
 not


allow
 foreign
 nations
 to
 meddle
 in
 its


backyard,
 so
 to
 speak.
 And
 so
 what
 he's


doing
 now
 is
 going,
 "Well,
 look,
 this
 is


the
 world
 we
 live
 in.
 I'm
 going
 to
 do


what's
 best
 for
 my
 country."
 And
 I
 think


that's
 what
 you're
 seeing.


>> Is
 there
 a
 risk
 with
 this
 strategy?


>> Of
 course,
 there's
 a
 risk
 with
 every


strategy.
 Of
 course,
 there's
 a
 risk
 with


this
 strategy.
 There
 was
 a
 big
 risk


inevitably
 with
 this
 strategy
 and
 I


think
 you
 know
 as
 I
 talked
 about
 in
 my


book
 the
 the
 west
 becoming
 weaker
 and


emboldening
 our
 enemies
 which
 is
 what
 we


have
 done
 for
 a
 long
 time
 now
 is


creating
 an
 environment
 where
 we
 are


opening
 ourselves
 up
 to
 challenge
 from


other
 forces.
 Russia
 invading
 Ukraine


was
 not
 an
 accident.
 It
 was
 not
 an


accident.
 It
 was
 a
 consequence
 of
 the


fact
 that
 Putin
 and
 other
 people
 in
 his


leadership
 team
 felt
 this
 was
 the
 moment


to
 test
 the
 waters.
 Can
 we
 now
 do
 the


things
 we've
 always
 wanted
 to
 do


>> and
 they
 felt
 they
 could
 do
 that
 under


Biden
 in
 your
 view?


>> Yes.
 But
 see,
 I
 wouldn't
 personalize
 it


down
 to
 that
 level.
 I
 think
 far
 too
 many


people
 get
 carried
 away
 with,
 you
 know,


Republican,
 Democrat,
 left,
 right,


Biden,
 Trump.
 It's
 an
 ongoing
 process


that's
 been
 going
 on
 for
 decades.
 And


the
 culmination
 of
 it
 was
 first
 the


invasion
 of
 Ukraine,
 then
 October
 7th.


October
 7th
 was
 not
 an
 accident
 either.


Hamas
 backed
 by
 Iran
 felt
 that
 this
 was


their
 moment
 to
 act
 because
 again
 is
 the


West
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 respond


morally,
 militarily,
 and
 in
 other
 ways


powerfully
 to
 that.
 They
 felt
 that
 they


were
 able
 to
 test
 it.
 The
 fact
 that


China
 now
 is
 openly
 talking
 about
 taking


Taiwan
 is
 again
 another
 symptom
 of
 this


same
 thing.
 So
 the
 risk
 is
 there
 and
 of


course
 the
 risk
 as
 well
 is
 that
 you
 know


the
 the
 crumbling
 western
 alliance
 we


can
 talk
 about
 the
 reasons
 for
 it.
 I


think
 it's
 really
 important
 to


particularly
 we're
 recording
 this
 in


Britain
 and
 and
 in
 Europe
 more
 broadly.


I
 think
 that's
 an
 important


conversation.
 The
 western
 alliance
 is


falling
 apart.
 Um
 and
 that
 is
 always


going
 to
 be
 a
 risk.
 It's
 particularly


big
 risk
 for
 Europe.
 I
 feel


>> how
 much
 of
 this
 and
 before
 we
 go
 into


the
 details
 and
 just
 catch
 up
 on
 a
 few


of
 the
 things
 you
 said
 there.
 How
 much


of
 this
 is
 linked
 to
 nuclear
 weapons?


Because
 I
 was
 thinking
 I
 I
 can't
 really


All
 of
 these
 superpowers
 are
 going
 for


countries
 that
 aren't
 armed
 with
 nuclear


weapons.


>> And
 it
 all
 it
 somewhat
 feels
 to
 me
 that


the
 reason
 why
 the
 US
 wouldn't
 get


involved
 if
 China
 took
 Taiwan
 is
 because


they
 have
 nukes.
 And
 the
 reason
 why


the
 US
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 intimidated
 by


Russia
 is
 because
 they
 have
 nukes.
 So
 is


it
 really
 the
 world
 is
 splitting
 into


nuclear
 powers
 and
 anyone
 with
 nukes
 can


do
 what
 the
 they
 want
 because
 they


can
 basically
 wipe
 out
 planet
 Earth
 if


they
 get
 angry.
 And
 that
 has
 always
 been


the
 case
 except
 we've
 been
 constrained


by
 the
 framework
 of
 the
 rules-based


order.
 But
 that
 got
 taken
 apart.
 And


this
 is
 where
 I
 think
 the
 West
 and
 the


United
 States
 including
 needs
 to
 take


responsibility
 because
 the
 the
 war
 in


Afghanistan
 and
 Iraq
 even
 more
 so


completely
 undermined
 our
 moral


credibility.
 You
 know,
 how
 can
 you
 say,


well,
 Russia
 isn't
 allowed
 to
 invade


Ukraine
 if
 you
 go
 around
 invading


countries
 on
 a
 whim,
 making
 up
 excuses


and
 reasons
 to
 do
 that.
 So
 we
 have


eroded
 our
 moral
 authority
 and
 we've


also
 eroded
 our
 military
 strength
 and


the
 potential
 that
 we
 have
 to
 inflict


damage
 on
 people
 who
 misbehave
 so
 to


speak.
 So
 both
 of
 those
 things
 have
 come


together.


>> It
 seems
 so
 crazy
 to
 me
 that
 in
 my


lifetime
 I'm
 I'm
 seeing
 cuz
 it's
 really


never
 happened
 in
 the
 33
 years
 that
 I've


been
 alive.
 I'm
 hearing
 a
 US
 president


talk
 about
 kidnapping
 another
 president


and
 then
 going
 in
 and
 taking
 the
 oil.


And
 then
 you
 know what?
 We
 might
 take


Greenland
 as
 well.
 We
 might
 have
 that


big
 country
 over
 there
 as
 well.
 Even


though
 it
 belongs
 to
 a
 NATO
 ally
 in


Denmark,


>> it
 it
 feels
 like
 something
 has


fundamentally
 changed.


>> It
 has.


>> And
 I'm
 scared
 of
 the
 presidents
 this
 is


going
 to
 set
 because
 do
 we
 then
 all
 just


get
 to
 start
 taking
 countries
 we
 want?


>> Well,
 this
 is
 what
 happens
 when
 there
 is


a
 a
 a
 a
 shifting
 of
 the
 balance
 of


power.
 This
 is
 why
 I
 always
 said


maintaining
 the
 unipolar
 moment
 as
 it


was
 and
 not
 allowing
 the
 west
 to
 weaken


itself
 was
 a
 really
 important
 thing


because
 the
 moment
 you
 have
 a
 power


vacuum,
 you
 always
 have
 a
 power


struggle.
 Mexico
 is
 a
 very
 good
 example


of
 this.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 what's
 been


happening,
 there's
 been
 a
 a
 gigantic


drug
 war
 in
 Mexico
 for
 the
 last
 20
 years


because
 there
 are
 different
 cartels


vying
 for
 power.
 And
 the
 moment
 you
 take


out
 the
 leader
 of
 one
 cartel
 or


something
 happens,
 there's
 a
 bloodbath.


Because
 this
 is
 what
 happens
 when
 the


central
 authority,
 the
 central
 power,


the
 the
 current
 system
 breaks
 down.
 You


inevitably
 end
 up
 in
 a
 much
 more


violent,
 much
 more
 unstable,
 much
 more


unpredictable
 place.
 And
 all
 Trump


really
 is
 doing
 is
 reflecting
 the


reality
 that
 has
 been
 already
 there
 for


years,
 except
 he's
 reflecting
 in


American
 foreign
 policy.
 He's
 saying,


"Well,
 look,
 if
 Russia
 is
 going
 to
 do


what
 it
 wants
 to
 do,
 and
 we
 can't
 stop


them,
 and
 if
 China
 is
 going
 to
 do
 what


they
 want
 to
 do,
 and
 we
 can't
 stop
 them,


well,
 we've
 got
 to
 do
 what
 we've
 got
 to


do,
 and
 no
 one's
 going
 to
 stop
 us."
 And


that's
 the
 world
 you've
 ended
 up
 in.
 And


by
 the
 way,
 just
 on
 the
 nuclear
 point,
 I


think
 it's
 important
 to
 say
 you're
 100%


right.
 And
 this
 is
 one
 of the
 things


I've
 always
 said
 about
 not
 supporting


Ukraine
 properly,
 which
 we
 haven't
 done.


we
 have
 not
 supported
 them
 enough
 to
 be


able
 to
 actually
 fully
 repel
 the


aggression
 from
 Russia
 is
 it
 would


inevitably
 lead
 to
 lots
 of
 other
 small


countries
 pursuing
 nuclear
 weapons


because
 it
 is
 the
 only
 guarantee
 of


security
 in
 this
 world.
 it
 that
 is
 a


huge
 danger
 for
 the
 world
 in
 terms
 of


nuclear
 proliferation
 because
 if
 the


precedent
 is
 like
 you
 say
 the
 people


with
 nuclear
 weapons
 can
 do
 what
 they


want
 and
 they
 can
 never
 be
 attacked
 and


the
 people
 with
 no
 nuclear
 weapons
 are


vulnerable
 and
 weak
 what
 would
 be
 the


most
 rational
 thing
 for
 you
 to
 do
 if


you're
 a
 smaller
 country
 that's
 the
 big


danger


>> cuz
 you
 know
 you
 were
 talking
 about
 a


uniolar
 world
 and
 a
 multi-polar
 world


but
 I
 wonder
 if
 the
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 how


many
 nuclear
 powers
 are
 there
 there's


like
 nine
 or
 or
 10


>> if
 the
 world
 is
 going
 to
 split
 into


these
 10
 nuclear
 powers
 and
 these
 10


nuclear
 powers
 can
 basically
 do
 what


they
 want.


>> Well,
 nuclear
 powers
 are
 different.
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 see
 Pakistan
 likely
 to
 be


rampaging
 through
 its
 neighbors,
 not
 at


least
 cuz
 they're
 all
 they're
 all


nuclear
 powers
 themselves.
 Uh
 I
 think


you're
 you're
 talking
 about
 Russia,


China,
 and
 the
 US
 primarily.
 I
 don't
 see


Britain,
 you
 know,
 reinvading
 France,


although
 that's
 something
 obviously
 I'm


in
 favor
 of.
 If
 Pakistan
 decided
 to
 take


a
 neighboring
 country
 though,


>> nobody
 can
 really
 come
 for
 them
 because


>> uh
 economic


>> having
 one
 nuke
 is
 not
 the
 same
 as


having
 a
 gigantic
 nuclear
 arsenal.
 I


think
 Pakistan
 is
 relatively
 constrained


in
 its
 behavior,
 but
 the
 big
 superpowers


are
 not.
 So,


>> by
 the
 way,
 retaking
 France
 was
 a
 joke.


I
 just
 want
 to
 make
 that
 clear.


>> And
 there's
 eight
 there's
 nine
 nuclear


powers.
 United
 States,
 Russia,
 UK,


France,
 China,
 India,
 Pakistan,
 North


Korea,
 and
 Israel.
 Although
 I
 don't


think
 they
 admit
 it.


>> Yeah.
 Israel's
 policy
 on
 nuclear
 weapons


is
 very
 funny.
 Do
 you
 know
 what
 the


official
 position
 is?
 We
 don't
 have


nuclear
 weapons,
 but
 if
 the
 state
 of


Israel
 is
 at
 risk
 of
 being
 destroyed,
 we


will
 definitely
 use
 them.


>> So,
 how
 did
 we
 get
 here?
 What
 are
 what


are
 the
 factors
 at
 play
 that
 brought
 us


to
 this
 particular
 situation?
 You
 talked


about
 the
 crumbling
 of
 the
 Western


Alliance
 and
 other
 things.
 What
 what
 do


we
 need
 to
 know
 about
 what
 happened
 for


us
 to
 get
 to
 this
 state
 where
 it
 seems


like
 it's
 every
 big
 power
 for
 themsel?


>> Well,
 partly
 we've
 already
 talked
 about


it.
 So
 it's
 it's
 after
 91
 in
 particular


the
 west
 loses
 its
 not
 only
 its
 sense
 of


purpose
 but
 it
 loses
 its
 its
 sense
 of


danger
 and
 sense
 of
 risk.
 So
 we
 get
 very


comfortable.
 I
 don't
 know if
 you
 know


this
 uh
 Europe
 is
 12%
 of
 the
 world's


population,
 25%
 of
 the
 world's
 GDP
 and


60%
 of
 the
 world's
 welfare
 spending.


>> Wow.


>> So
 if
 you
 do
 that,
 that
 is
 a
 sign
 that


you've
 got
 very
 comfortable.
 You've
 got


very
 lazy.
 You
 have
 lost
 the
 ability
 to


realize
 you
 live
 in
 a
 dangerous
 world.


It's,
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 a


sidetrack,
 but
 it
 is
 an
 important


addendum
 to
 this
 conversation.
 This
 is


why
 European
 countries
 have
 pursued


economic
 suicide
 that
 we
 call
 net
 zero


as
 vigorously
 as
 we
 have
 because
 we
 have


felt
 so
 safe
 and
 so
 comfortable.
 we've


engaged
 in
 all
 this
 luxury
 uh
 obsessions


to
 the
 point
 where
 as
 you
 know
 Germany


destroyed
 its
 nuclear
 facilities
 uh


thereby
 making
 itself
 reliant
 on
 Russian


gas
 so
 that
 when
 Russia
 invaded
 Ukraine


the
 Germans
 opened
 the
 first
 thing
 that


they
 said
 is
 oh
 we
 were
 going
 to
 support


Ukraine
 we're
 going
 to
 give
 them
 5,000


helmets
 right
 because
 they
 were
 so


dependent
 on
 Russian
 gas
 because
 they


refused
 to
 produce
 their
 own
 energy
 this


is
 exactly
 the
 same
 thing
 we've
 done
 in


Britain
 Britain
 has
 the
 highest


industrial
 electricity
 prices
 in
 the


world
 in
 the
 developed
 world
 which
 means


we
 basically
 destroyed
 all
 our


manufacturing
 industry
 which
 is
 now


produced
 elsewhere.
 We're
 getting
 to
 the


point
 where
 we
 can't
 make
 our
 own
 virgin


steel.
 Steel
 is
 kind
 of
 important
 if
 you


want
 to
 have
 a
 military
 etc
 etc
 etc.
 So


in
 Europe
 in
 particular,
 this
 has


happened
 because
 we've
 just
 felt
 so
 safe


and
 so
 comfortable
 and
 also
 so


rudderless
 that
 we've
 been
 able
 to


engage
 in
 all
 these
 looney
 ideas
 because


there's
 been
 no
 consequence.
 Well,
 the


consequences
 are
 here.


>> Where
 does
 Britain
 and
 Europe
 sit
 in
 the


sort
 of
 rankings
 of
 importance
 in
 the


world
 and
 power?


>> It's
 plummeting.


I
 mean,
 look
 at
 the
 the
 Trump's
 uh


12-day
 war
 in
 Iran,
 destroying
 Iran's


nuclear
 facilities.
 No
 one
 even
 asked


the
 British
 what
 we
 thought
 about


anymore.
 And
 that's
 not
 because,
 you


know,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 like
 to
 say,
 "Oh,


you
 know,
 the
 Americans,
 they
 hate
 the


British."
 Americans
 love
 Britain.
 As
 you


know,
 you
 live
 in
 America
 now.
 You
 have


a
 British
 accent.
 I'm
 sure
 people
 come


up
 to
 you
 all
 the
 time
 and
 talk
 to
 you


about
 their
 connections
 with
 our


country,
 the
 shared
 history,
 all
 of
 that


stuff.
 The
 problem
 is
 we
 have
 made


ourselves
 irrelevant
 because
 everything


that
 Trump
 is
 looking
 at
 is
 strength.


Right?
 Is
 Britain
 strong
 now
 in
 the


world?
 No.
 Is
 Europe
 strong
 now
 in
 the


world?
 No.
 And
 so
 if
 you're
 not
 strong,


you
 will
 not
 be
 taken
 seriously.
 And


unfortunately
 because
 of
 what
 our


leaders
 have
 done
 over
 success
 of
 and


it's
 left
 right
 every
 political
 party


that
 we
 have
 that's
 been
 in
 power
 they


have
 overseen
 a
 decline
 in
 our
 status
 in


the
 world
 in
 our
 power
 in
 the
 world
 in


our
 influence
 in
 the
 world
 to
 the
 point


now
 where
 the
 Americans
 are
 looking
 at


Europe
 and
 they're
 going
 why
 would
 we
 be


allied
 with
 people
 who
 are
 not
 useful
 to


us
 an
 alliance
 is
 kind
 of
 like
 a


marriage
 both
 people
 have
 to
 bring


something
 to
 the
 table
 what
 do
 we
 bring


to
 the
 table
 from
 an
 American


perspective


>> this
 is
 a
 fairly
 new
 thing,
 isn't
 it?


Because
 I
 remember
 growing
 up,
 I'd


repeatedly
 hear
 the
 prime
 minister
 of


the
 UK
 talking
 about
 how
 he
 had
 spoken


to
 his
 US
 counterpart
 and
 they
 had
 made


a
 decision
 and
 then
 in
 even
 with
 the


Venezuela
 situation,
 I
 think
 Karma
 came


out
 the
 next
 day
 and
 said
 like,
 I
 had
 no


idea
 this
 was
 happening.


>> Of
 course,
 but
 why
 would
 you
 consult


with
 people
 who
 don't
 matter?


>> Why
 don't
 we
 matter?


>> We
 don't
 matter
 because
 we
 have
 nothing


to
 bring
 to
 the
 table.
 We
 don't
 despite


the
 the
 extremely
 high
 level
 of


professionalism,
 our
 technological


superiority,
 the
 courage
 of
 our
 soldiers


and
 our
 sailors
 and
 our
 airmen,
 despite


the
 immense
 military
 tradition
 Britain


has,
 we
 have
 cut
 I
 mean
 our
 debt


interest
 repayments
 annually


1.5
 times
 heading
 towards
 being
 twice


our
 defense
 budget.
 We
 spent
 more
 on


paying
 off
 the
 debt,
 the
 national
 debt


every
 year
 than
 we
 spend
 on
 defense.
 How


did
 the
 UK
 get
 here?


>> Well,
 our
 our
 debt
 to
 GDP
 is
 over
 100%.


We
 keep
 borrowing
 money.
 We
 talked
 about


the
 disproportionate
 amount
 of
 welfare


spending
 and
 social
 spending
 and
 so
 on.


We
 got
 here
 by
 forgetting
 that
 we
 live


in
 the
 real
 world
 and
 engaging
 in
 lots


of
 luxury
 beliefs
 about
 what
 we
 ought
 to


do.
 Uh
 so
 we
 have
 the
 highest
 tax
 burden


in
 peace
 time
 history
 in
 this
 country.


And
 we
 do
 that
 not
 because
 we
 want
 to


have
 a
 robust
 military
 or
 to
 do
 other


things
 like
 that.
 We
 do
 it
 so
 that
 we


can
 continue
 to
 pay
 ourselves
 money
 we


don't
 have
 borrowing
 it
 from
 our


children
 and
 our
 grandchildren.
 And
 this


is
 the
 case
 across
 Europe
 really.


America
 also
 has
 a
 high
 level
 of
 debt


but
 they
 have
 a
 growing
 economy
 unlike


ours.
 Britain
 uh
 Britain's
 GDP
 per


capita
 is
 lower
 today
 than
 it
 was
 in


2006.
 We
 have
 per
 capita
 which
 is
 what


matters
 per
 person.
 We
 have
 less
 money


today
 than
 we
 did
 20
 years
 ago.
 So
 our


economy's
 declined.
 We've
 destroyed
 our


manufacturing.
 we've
 run
 down
 our
 armed


forces.
 And
 also,
 I
 mean,
 look,


President
 Trump,
 I
 think,
 is
 fair
 to


say,
 is
 quite
 sensitive
 about
 what


people
 say
 about
 him.
 We
 have
 a


government
 now
 that
 very
 imprudently
 and


unwisely
 spent
 the
 time
 they
 were
 in


opposition
 on
 him
 on
 a
 daily


basis.
 David
 Lambie,
 if
 you
 take,
 who's


our
 foreign
 secretary,
 if
 you
 take
 some


of
 his
 comments
 about
 President
 Trump,


they
 were
 just
 deeply
 irresponsible.


whatever
 you
 think
 about
 the
 rights
 and


wrongs
 of
 what
 he
 said.
 A
 someone
 who


has
 the
 potential
 to
 be
 this
 country's


foreign
 secretary
 in
 charge
 of
 our


relationship
 with
 the
 United
 States


cannot
 be
 so
 imprudent
 as
 to
 make
 those


kinds
 of
 comments.
 And
 then
 you're


going,
 well,
 you've
 just
 been
 calling


this
 guy
 every
 name
 under
 the
 sun
 and


now
 you
 want
 to
 you
 want
 to
 be
 relevant.


You
 want
 to
 be
 taken
 seriously.
 You
 want


to
 be
 engaged
 with
 as
 he
 makes
 huge


decisions
 about
 geopolitics.
 Actions


have
 consequences
 and
 the
 actions
 we


have
 been
 taken
 have
 produced
 the


consequences
 that
 we've
 got.
 Now
 look,
 I


am
 not
 all
 doom
 and
 gloom
 about
 that.
 If


we
 change
 our
 strategy
 and
 if
 we
 change


our
 behavior,
 we
 can
 change
 the
 pro
 the


the
 the
 end
 product
 of
 that.
 We
 can
 do


that.
 But
 that's
 going
 to
 require
 a


massive
 readjustment


>> with
 the
 current
 direction
 of
 travel.


Where
 does
 the
 UK
 end
 up?


>> We're
 already
 there.
 We're
 irrelevant.


We
 are
 irrelevant
 when
 these,
 like
 you


said,
 Venezuela
 happens.
 No
 one
 cares


about
 us.
 When
 Iran
 gets
 bombed,
 no
 one


cares
 about
 us.
 All
 the
 future
 big


decisions
 about
 geopolitics
 are
 going
 to


be
 made
 without
 Britain
 even
 being


considered
 because
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 made


by
 the
 major
 powers
 of
 which
 Britain
 is


no
 longer
 one.


>> You
 choose
 to
 live
 in
 the
 UK
 despite


your
 views
 that
 the
 UK
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 a


sinking
 ship.
 I
 guess


>> because
 of
 my
 views
 actually.


>> Because
 of
 your
 views.


>> Yeah.
 Like
 look,
 you've
 moved
 to
 the


United
 States,
 which
 I'm
 grateful
 for


cuz
 it's
 made
 us
 the
 biggest
 UK
 podcast


in
 our
 space.
 I
 I
 appreciate
 that.
 But


as
 you
 can
 imagine,
 we
 get
 offers
 to
 do


the
 same
 in
 all
 sorts
 of
 different
 ways,


and
 we
 could
 have
 done
 the
 same.
 I
 love


this
 country.
 I'm
 very
 grateful
 to,
 and


I
 feel
 to
 stay
 and
 fight
 for
 it
 and
 to


articulate
 my
 views
 and
 try
 and
 persuade


people
 to
 my
 point
 of
 view
 so
 that
 we


can
 have
 a
 British
 renaissance,
 so
 that


we
 can
 have
 a
 British
 recovery
 is
 my


duty
 for
 as
 long
 as
 I
 can
 do
 that.
 And


if
 at
 some
 point,
 you
 know,
 I
 feel
 it's


completely
 futile,
 which
 I
 do
 not.
 Um,


>> so
 you
 hopeful.


>> I'm
 not
 despondent
 to
 the
 point
 of


giving
 up
 is
 where
 I
 am.


>> Are
 you
 hopeful?


>> No.
 No.
 But
 but
 I'm
 also
 not
 at
 the


point
 where
 I
 feel
 it's
 futile.
 I
 think


there
 is
 there
 is
 an
 opportunity
 to
 turn


things
 around
 if
 if
 everything
 comes


together
 and
 we're
 very
 fortunate.
 Uh,


and
 that's
 what
 I'm
 hopefully
 trying
 to


contribute
 to.
 through
 history
 when


companies
 pursue
 the
 strategy
 that
 the


UK
 is
 currently
 pursuing


>> where
 where
 does
 it
 end
 up
 economically?


>> Well,
 Stephen,
 you're
 the
 business
 guy.


You
 tell
 me.


>> No,
 but
 I
 don't
 I'm
 not
 I
 don't
 have
 the


greatest
 view
 of
 history
 and
 so
 I'm


wondering
 if
 there's
 because
 you
 know
 in


the
 UK
 I
 I
 was
 born
 33
 years
 ago
 in


Bosotswana
 and
 I
 moved
 to
 the
 UK
 when
 I


was
 young
 and
 um
 I've
 always
 known
 the


UK
 to
 be
 important
 and
 consequential
 and


the
 the
 economy
 to
 be,
 you
 know,
 much


better
 than
 where
 I'm
 from
 in
 Botswana.


So
 it's
 it's
 almost
 inconceivable
 for
 a


British
 person
 of
 my
 age
 to
 to
 think


that
 the
 UK
 could
 ever
 not
 be
 that.
 Yes.


Because
 it's
 always
 been
 in
 my
 lifetime.


>> Yes.
 But
 that
 is
 in
 many
 ways
 I'm
 not


pinning
 the
 blame
 on
 you
 obviously,
 but


that
 is
 in
 many
 ways
 how
 we
 got
 here.


Because
 what
 we
 thought
 collectively


was,
 well,
 look,
 no
 matter
 what
 we
 do,


we're
 always
 going
 to
 be
 Great
 Britain.


We're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 great
 economy.


We're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 strong
 military.


We're
 going to
 have
 a
 this.
 We're
 going


to
 have
 influence
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 then


we
 started
 doing
 lots
 of
 stupid


And
 that's
 how
 we've
 ended
 up
 in
 the


place
 that
 we've
 ended
 up.
 So
 this


country
 has
 every
 potential
 to
 be
 great.


The
 people
 are
 incredible.
 The
 level
 of


education,
 uh,
 the
 scientific
 and


technological
 advances
 that
 this
 country


has
 produced,
 the
 cultural,
 look
 at
 the


greatest
 bands
 in
 human
 history.
 Like


half
 of
 them
 are
 British
 comedians.
 I


mean,
 standup
 comedy
 is
 not
 a
 a
 British


invention.
 It
 was
 actually
 invented
 in


America.
 But
 look
 at
 some
 of
 the


greatest
 comedians
 in
 human
 history.


Again,
 lots
 and
 lots
 of
 British
 people.


So
 culturally,
 scientifically,


technologically,
 economically,
 we
 have


the
 potential.
 We
 have
 to
 have
 the


correct
 leadership
 and
 the
 right


strategy.
 And
 those
 two
 things
 have
 been


lacking
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 That's
 how


we've
 ended
 up
 here.
 Can
 we
 turn
 it


around?
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 very,
 very,


very
 difficult.
 But
 I
 but
 we've
 got
 to


try.


>> Why
 would
 these
 issues
 impact
 us
 on
 a


individual
 level?
 So
 I'm
 thinking
 about


the
 average
 person
 listening
 now,


whether
 they
 are
 in
 the
 United
 States
 or


here
 in
 Britain.
 You
 know,
 this
 stuff


happens
 kind
 of
 up
 above
 us
 and
 we
 get


on
 with
 our
 lives.
 But
 what
 are
 the


symptoms
 we'll
 begin
 to
 see


>> this
 multipolar
 world
 or
 the
 the
 fall
 of


Britain?


>> You
 are
 already
 poorer
 today
 than
 you


were
 20
 years
 ago


>> per
 capita


>> in
 the
 UK.


>> In
 the
 UK,


>> yeah,


>> that
 seems
 to
 me
 quite
 important.
 And
 in


fact,
 many
 of
 our
 conversations
 about


domestic
 issues,
 whether
 it's
 mass


immigration
 and
 all
 of
 these
 other


things,
 they're
 really
 proxies
 for
 that


conversation.
 because
 if
 we
 if
 the


economy
 was
 growing
 and
 people
 felt


richer,


all
 of
 this
 stuff
 would
 become
 less


important,
 right?
 Well,
 I
 think
 we'd


agree
 with
 that.
 So,
 that's
 one
 aspect


of
 it.
 The
 other
 aspect
 of
 it
 is,
 as
 I


talked
 about
 the
 multipolar
 world
 being


by
 necessity
 more
 violent
 and
 unstable.


We
 are
 going,
 you
 know,
 you
 we
 I
 don't


know
 when
 this
 will
 go
 out,
 but
 we're


recording
 this
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 January.


It's
 been
 like
 two
 weeks
 since
 the
 year


started
 and
 we've
 already
 seen
 crazy


amounts
 of
 instability
 geopolitically


already.
 Is
 that
 fair
 to
 say?
 So,
 this


will
 continue
 and
 that
 will
 bleed


through
 to
 domestic
 politics
 because
 if


you
 have
 to
 spend
 more
 of
 your
 resources


worrying
 about
 things
 abroad,
 it
 means


you
 can
 do
 less
 at
 home
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so


on
 and
 so
 on.
 So
 the
 the
 ramifications


of
 this
 will
 be
 very
 impactful
 on


everybody
 around
 the
 world
 more
 on


non-western
 countries
 because
 they
 a
 lot


of
 them
 are
 going
 to
 be
 in
 the
 front


line
 of
 this
 in
 in
 the
 way
 that
 I
 I


doubt
 we
 will
 be.
 Uh
 but
 still
 the


consequences
 for
 us
 will
 be
 very


significant.


>> And
 we're
 seeing
 adjacent
 to
 this
 this


rise
 in
 socialism.


>> Yeah.


>> The
 conversation
 around
 socialism.


Obviously
 Menani
 has
 been
 elected
 mayor.


But
 do
 you
 think
 this
 is
 at
 all
 linked


to
 the
 bigger
 picture
 this
 rise
 in


socialism?


>> Yeah.
 In
 fact,
 I
 I
 think
 you
 know
 I


wrote
 an
 article
 a
 long
 time
 ago
 called


Why
 I
 Fear
 the
 Future
 and
 I
 did
 a
 video


based
 on
 it
 in
 which
 I
 talked
 about


something.
 It's
 interesting.
 I
 did
 a


live
 show
 um
 here
 in
 London
 just
 before


Christmas
 and
 I
 did
 a
 book
 signing
 and


one
 of
 the
 guys
 came
 up
 to
 me
 and
 he


said,
 "I've
 got
 two
 kids.
 They're
 both


teenagers,
 daughter
 and
 the
 son
 and
 I'm


trying
 to
 pull
 the
 daughter
 in
 from
 the


far
 left
 and
 I'm
 trying
 to
 pull
 the
 son


in
 from
 the
 far
 right."
 That's
 going
 to


be
 the
 big
 challenge
 going
 forward


because
 um
 the
 amount
 of
 chaos
 and


instability
 and
 cultural
 kind
 of


cultural
 upheaval
 that
 we've
 seen
 has


produced
 a
 craving
 for
 order
 and
 on
 the


social
 that's
 the
 right
 side
 you
 know
 we


must
 you
 know
 get
 this
 and
 on
 the
 other


side
 it's
 produced
 a
 sense
 of
 injustice


and
 the
 pursuit
 of
 inequality.
 That's


why
 you
 hear
 people
 talk
 so
 much
 about


the
 rich
 the
 rich
 the
 rich
 the
 rich
 and


you
 know
 eat
 the
 rich
 we
 got
 to


redistribute
 all
 of
 this
 stuff
 because


particularly
 in
 the
 big
 cities
 young


people
 rightly
 feel
 that
 they
 can
 they


can't
 really
 get
 on
 the
 housing
 ladder


they
 can't
 establish
 a
 family
 life
 is


more
 difficult
 so
 they
 reach
 for
 these


very
 um
 dis
 disproven
 discredited
 and


completely
 unworkable
 solutions
 of
 the


kind
 Manny
 uh
 will
 of
 course
 deliver
 but


it's
 because
 their
 sense
 of
 their
 sense


is
 that
 the
 future's
 been
 taken
 away


from
 And
 in
 many
 ways
 they're
 correct


because
 as
 I
 said
 earlier
 we
 have
 been


borrowing
 from
 our
 children
 and
 our


grandchildren.
 We've
 been
 saddling
 with


crippling
 debts
 our
 entire
 economy
 that


will
 come
 to
 an
 end
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 be


them
 that
 is
 left
 to
 foot
 the
 bill
 and


it's
 going to
 be
 very
 painful
 and
 partly


they
 see
 that
 and
 already
 they
 see
 that


they
 just
 can't
 afford
 the
 life
 that


they
 want.
 I
 do
 think
 in
 the
 United


States
 it's
 a
 much
 more
 contained


phenomenon.
 I
 think
 Mamani
 and
 if
 you


look
 at
 sort
 of
 the
 American
 socialists,


they
 all
 tend
 to
 cluster
 around
 New
 York


and
 one
 or
 two
 other
 big
 cities.
 It's


not
 like
 the
 entirety
 of
 America
 is


going
 socialist.
 But
 I
 think
 housing


unaffordability
 is
 one.
 Another


explanation
 which
 I
 think
 is
 also


powerful
 is
 what's
 called
 elite
 over


production
 which
 is
 if
 you
 have
 as
 Tony


Blair
 did
 this
 idea
 that
 50%
 of
 the


public
 should
 should
 go
 to
 university.


Well,
 they
 do
 and
 then
 it
 turns
 out


there's
 not
 enough
 jobs
 for
 them.


Particularly
 in
 the
 age
 of
 AI
 where
 they


are
 the
 jobs
 that
 are
 being
 eliminated


very
 rapidly.
 You
 then
 get
 a
 lot
 of


people
 whose
 entitlement
 is
 up
 here
 and


whose
 prospects
 are
 down
 here.
 That


produces
 a
 tremendous
 amount
 of
 social


disease
 as
 well.


>> I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 really
 important


connected
 point


on
 the
 subject
 of
 socialism
 and
 the
 rise


of
 socialism
 that
 we
 will
 see
 is
 this


point
 of
 AI.
 And
 when
 I
 listen
 to
 very


very
 smart
 people
 who
 are
 considered
 to


be
 the
 godfathers
 of
 AI
 or
 CEOs
 who
 are


building
 these
 technology
 companies,


there
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 consensus
 that


socialism
 will
 only
 increase
 because
 the


job
 losses
 associated
 with
 AI
 are
 going


to
 be
 pretty
 quick
 and
 pretty
 extreme.


And
 um
 I
 mean
 one
 of
 them
 that
 most


Brits
 won't
 understand
 is
 something
 we


understand
 now
 living
 in
 America,
 which


is
 my
 car
 drives
 itself.


>> Yes.
 And
 I
 I've
 said
 this
 a
 few
 times


because
 I'm
 really
 trying
 to
 it's
 like


the
 first
 moment
 Eureka
 moment
 I
 think


you
 have
 is
 in
 America
 when
 I
 get
 in
 my


car
 I
 don't
 touch
 the
 steering
 wheel
 or


the
 pedals
 and
 it
 can
 drive
 me
 to
 Joshua


Tree
 which
 is
 like
 2
 and
 a
 half
 three


hours
 away
 uninterrupted
 and
 I
 say
 this


because
 driving
 is
 like
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 employees
 in
 the
 world.
 I
 think


it
 is
 the
 biggest
 profession
 in
 the


world


>> and
 London
 just
 announced
 that
 Whimos


are
 here
 and
 soon
 surely
 Teslas
 will
 be


allowed
 to
 do
 full
 self-driving
 here
 as


well


>> and
 in
 such
 a
 world
 delivery
 drivers,


taxi
 drivers,
 Uber
 drivers
 are
 going
 to


be
 without
 jobs
 and
 we're
 seeing
 this
 um


huge
 rise
 in
 autonomous
 humanoid
 robots


as
 well


>> and
 Elon's
 pay
 packet
 says
 that
 he
 he


will
 make
 a
 million
 of
 these
 autonomous


robots
 and
 get
 them
 out
 into
 the
 world


and
 Jason
 Kakanakas
 who
 just
 visited


Elon
 's
 factory
 said
 there'll
 be
 a


billion
 of
 these
 and
 he
 thinks
 that
 we


won't
 even
 even
 remember
 Tesla
 for


making
 cars
 will
 only
 remember
 them
 for


the
 robots
 they're
 made
 because
 these


Optimus
 robots
 which
 are
 coming
 are


going
 to
 be
 so
 consequential
 and
 the


last
 point
 here
 is
 a
 very
 good
 friend
 of


mine
 who
 runs
 this
 big
 sort
 of


innovation
 accelerator
 in
 San
 Francisco


I
 visited
 the
 accelerator
 a
 couple
 of


weeks
 back
 and
 um
 he
 I
 said
 to
 him
 why


why
 is
 everybody
 here
 all
 these
 young


founders
 these
 40
 50
 young
 founders
 in


your
 building
 called
 effing
 all
 working


on
 robotics
 and
 he
 goes
 well
 you
 know


we've
 had
 all
 parts
 for
 like
 20,
 30


years.
 But
 the
 expensive
 part
 was
 the


intelligence.


>> The
 brain.


>> Yeah.
 The
 brain.
 He
 goes,
 "Now
 we
 have


the
 bra."
 He
 said, "It
 used
 to
 He
 showed


me
 this
 arm,
 this
 robotic
 arm
 that
 had
 a


frying
 pan
 on
 it
 that
 would
 cook
 for
 you


in
 a
 box.
 It
 just
 cooks
 whatever
 you


want
 in
 a
 box."
 And
 he
 goes,
 "We've
 had


all
 these
 parts
 for
 the
 last
 30
 years."


That
 they
 were
 cheap.
 He
 goes,
 "The
 the


intelligence
 part,
 the
 brain
 would
 cost


20
 or
 $30,000
 just
 for
 this
 little
 robot


arm."
 He
 goes,
 "Now
 it's
 like
 2
 cents."


>> Yeah.


>> And
 he
 say,
 "So
 you're
 seeing
 this
 huge


explosion
 in
 robotics."
 I
 don't
 think


people
 understand
 what's
 coming.


>> No.
 And
 going
 to
 San
 Francisco
 is


eyeopening
 on
 two
 levels.
 Number
 one
 is


like
 a
 quarter
 to
 a
 third
 of
 the
 cars
 on


the
 road
 don't
 have
 drivers.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 just
 visually
 seeing
 that
 is
 so


striking.


>> Um
 but
 the
 other
 thing
 is
 talking
 to


some
 of
 the
 people
 involved.
 There
 is
 a


there
 are
 some
 people
 who
 are
 fairly


sensible
 about
 it,
 fairly
 responsible


among
 the
 founders,
 although
 they
 will


still
 say
 and
 I
 think
 they're
 right
 that


like
 if
 we
 don't
 do
 this,
 China
 will
 and


so
 we've
 got
 to
 do
 this.
 But
 there's


also
 a
 lot
 and
 I
 I'm
 sure
 you've


encountered
 there's
 a
 kind
 of
 you
 know


that
 famous
 Facebook
 mantra
 of
 move
 fast


and
 break
 things.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 that


going
 on
 in
 the
 AI
 space
 and
 so
 it's


going
 to
 be
 hugely
 impactful.
 I
 don't


claim
 to
 know
 the
 the
 all
 the
 little


details
 of
 how
 that
 will
 play
 out
 other


than
 to
 say
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 very


disruptive.
 Uh
 and
 disruptiveness
 has


happened
 throughout
 human
 history.
 It's


always
 produced
 a
 backlash.
 It's
 always


caused
 a
 lot
 of
 disease.
 But
 then


humanity
 has
 managed
 to
 recover.
 This
 is


different
 level
 and
 we
 will
 see
 how
 it


plays
 out.
 But
 yeah,
 of
 course
 it's


going
 to
 be
 and
 yeah,
 a
 world
 in
 which


millions
 of
 people
 in
 which
 millions
 of


people
 no
 longer
 have
 jobs
 and
 most
 of


them
 are
 disproportionately
 young
 people


who
 are
 more
 prone
 to
 extremism
 anyway.


Yeah,
 that's
 not
 a
 pretty
 picture


>> and
 one
 would
 assume
 that
 the
 wealth


will
 acrude
 to
 a
 few.


>> Yes,


>> in
 such
 a
 scenario.


>> And
 what's
 funny
 is
 I
 have
 said
 really


only
 half
 jokingly.
 I
 mean
 I
 wrote
 a


whole
 book
 about
 my
 opposition
 to


communism
 and
 socialism
 based
 on


experience.


In
 a
 world
 in
 which
 no
 one
 has
 a
 job,


I'm
 like
 100%
 on
 board
 with
 communism.


>> Do
 you
 think
 that's
 the
 world
 we're


heading
 towards?


>> Possibly.


>> Yeah.
 But
 it
 makes
 sense.
 I
 mean,
 like


you,
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it
 from
 the


perspective
 of


50
 people
 in
 the
 world,
 have
 all
 the


money
 in
 the
 world,
 and
 everyone
 else


has
 no
 job.
 I
 think
 a
 little
 bit
 of


wealth
 redistribution
 is
 going
 to
 be


unavoidable
 in
 that
 situation.
 And
 it


can
 either
 happen
 voluntarily
 or
 it's


going
 to
 happen
 at
 the
 end
 of
 bayonets.


That's
 the
 choice.


>> When
 you
 say
 communism
 would
 be
 the
 only


choice
 in
 such
 a
 scenario,
 what
 what


does
 that
 mean?


>> Uh
 it
 means
 everybody
 gets
 paid
 for


existing,


right?
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 what
 else
 is
 there?


You're
 going
 to
 create
 fake
 jobs
 for


people.
 That's
 not
 going
 to
 work,
 right?


So
 if
 if
 all
 the
 wealth
 in
 the
 world
 is


going
 to
 be
 created
 by
 robots,
 a
 world


in
 which
 th
 the
 products
 of
 their
 labor


it
 only
 acrus
 to
 50
 people
 who
 had
 the


idea
 or
 did
 the
 work
 20
 years
 ago
 that's


not
 going
 to
 sustain
 itself.
 And
 so
 uh


it
 would
 be
 very
 very
 unwise
 of
 those


people
 to
 attempt
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 all
 that


wealth
 and
 it
 would
 not
 end
 well
 for


them
 in
 my
 opinion.


>> On
 a
 personal
 level,
 you
 know,
 this


disruption
 is
 going
 to
 happen
 in
 your


lifetime.


>> Yeah.
 Are
 you
 thinking
 much
 about
 it
 or


planning
 for
 it
 at
 all?
 Did
 has
 it


changed
 any
 of
 the
 decisions
 you
 you


make
 on
 a
 a
 day-to-day
 basis
 or


month-to-month
 basis?


>> Well,
 I'm
 very
 fortunate
 that
 I
 am


probably
 a
 little
 harder
 to
 replace
 with


a
 robot
 just
 because
 people
 don't
 really


want
 to
 hear
 robots
 opinions.
 I
 would


imagine
 we
 might
 get
 to
 that
 point,
 but


I
 think
 it's
 unlikely.
 So
 on
 my
 my
 own


level,
 I'm
 probably,
 you
 know,
 the
 time


scale
 I'm
 working
 to
 in
 the
 next
 10


years,
 I
 imagine
 I'll
 I'll
 get
 myself
 to


a
 point
 where
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 reasonably


comfortable
 no matter
 what
 happens.
 For


my
 children,


>> that
 was
 us
 cutting
 forward
 10
 years
 and


watching.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Just
 totally
 me
 just


unemployed
 long.


I
 can't
 believe
 what
 happened.
 For
 my


children,
 it's
 a
 very
 different


conversation.
 Uh
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


like,
 well,
 you
 know,
 what
 should
 I


teach
 my
 children?
 And
 people
 are,
 oh


yeah,
 they
 should
 be
 a
 plumber.
 I
 don't


think
 you're
 going
 to
 need
 plumbers
 15,


20
 years
 from
 now
 either.
 So
 I
 I


honestly
 don't
 know
 what
 that
 future


looks
 like.
 And
 in
 many
 ways,
 that's


always
 been
 the
 reality
 of
 life
 for
 most


people.
 We
 are
 living
 through
 one
 of


those
 great
 transitions
 in
 human
 history


in
 which
 all
 you
 can
 do
 is
 equip
 your


children
 with
 the
 basic
 skill
 sets
 of


life
 as
 opposed
 to
 what
 might
 have
 been


done
 20
 30
 years
 ago
 where
 like
 you
 you


get
 you
 go
 to
 school
 to
 develop
 a
 skill


to
 go
 to
 university
 to
 build
 a
 career.


Now,
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 show
 a
 lot


of
 flex
 in
 this
 modern
 world.
 So,
 you're


going
 to
 have
 to
 be
 personable.
 You're


going
 to
 have
 to
 be
 resourceful.
 You're


going
 to
 have
 to
 be
 creative.
 You're


going to
 have
 to
 go
 have
 a
 a
 positive


go-getter
 mindset.
 You're
 going
 to
 have


to
 have
 those
 basics
 nailed
 down
 as


opposed
 to
 here's
 the
 career
 that
 you've


been
 predetermined
 to
 have,
 unless
 of


course
 you
 go
 into
 AI
 and
 robotics,
 in


which
 case
 you
 probably
 won't
 be


replaced
 for
 at least
 5
 years.


>> I
 think
 there's
 something
 to
 the
 fact


that
 there's
 an
 angst
 with
 AI.
 And
 when


you
 know
 people
 listen
 to
 podcasts
 all


the
 time.
 Yeah.


>> They
 everyone
 who
 has
 a
 job
 in
 a
 big


corporate
 environment
 now
 is
 being
 told


by
 their
 CEO
 that
 you
 better
 learn
 AI
 or


it's
 going
 to
 replace
 you.
 So
 we're


living
 in
 this
 moment
 of


>> there's
 like
 aliens
 coming
 over
 the


horizon
 and
 we've
 spotted
 them.


>> They're
 not
 quite
 here
 yet,


>> but
 it's
 it's
 like
 saying
 to
 the
 general


public,
 look,
 there's
 aliens
 coming
 and


they're
 coming
 for
 your
 job
 and


everything
 you
 value.
 That
 angst
 in
 and


of
 itself
 I
 think
 can
 drive
 people


towards
 ideas
 like
 socialism


understandably.


>> Yeah.


>> Because
 you
 you
 know
 it's
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


deep
 existential
 angst


>> and
 also
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 AI
 people
 not
 all


of
 them
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 are
 being
 but
 a


lot
 of
 them
 are
 being
 deeply


irresponsible
 and
 very
 unwise
 with
 their


messaging.
 What?
 Last
 time
 I
 was
 in
 New


York,
 I
 was
 walking
 through
 Time
 Square.


There
 was
 this
 giant
 billboard
 which


said,
 it
 was
 the
 name
 of
 the
 company,


which
 I
 don't
 remember.
 Stop
 hiring


humans.
 The
 age
 of
 the
 AI
 employees


here.
 I'm
 going,
 have
 you
 really
 thought


about
 this?
 Have
 you
 thought
 about


putting
 your
 company's
 name
 on
 this


poster?
 Do
 you
 understand
 the
 impact


this
 is
 going
 to
 have
 on
 a
 normal
 person


looking
 at
 that?
 Um,
 but
 they
 are.
 So,


the
 thing
 is
 with
 AI
 is
 the
 the
 positive


upsides
 of
 it
 are
 limitless.
 Literally


limitless.
 And
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 people


who
 are
 in
 that
 space,
 that's
 what
 they


focus
 on.
 And
 they're
 like,
 we
 can
 solve


cancer.
 We
 can
 solve
 medical
 problems.


We
 can
 have
 AI
 that's
 better
 than
 any


physicist
 that
 can
 ever
 that's
 ever


lived
 that
 can
 give
 us
 the,
 you
 know,


the
 eternal
 engine
 or
 or
 or
 whatever.
 We


don't
 need
 energy
 anymore.
 Like
 there


are
 all
 sorts
 of
 crazy
 things
 that
 come


out
 of
 AI
 that
 are
 potentially


beneficial.
 And
 that
 is
 exciting.
 But


the
 angst
 that
 you
 talk
 about,
 I
 think,


is
 there.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 also
 quite


rational.
 You
 just
 reminded
 me
 of
 a


video
 that
 came
 out
 this
 week
 from
 Elon


where
 he
 says
 this.
 I'll
 play
 it
 for


you.
 I
 think
 it's
 this
 one's.
 So,
 he's


talking
 about
 Elon's
 talking
 about
 the


robots
 that
 are
 about
 to
 be
 released


from
 Tesla,
 which
 are
 called
 Optimus.


And
 someone's
 asking
 him


>> how
 good
 they
 will
 be
 at
 surgery.


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 Optimus
 will
 be
 a


better
 surgeon
 than
 the
 best
 surgeons?


How
 long
 for
 that?


>> Three
 years.


>> Three
 years.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 And
 by
 the
 way,


I
 say
 three
 years.


at
 scale.


>> Yes.


>> And
 there
 will
 be
 more
 probably
 more


Optimus
 robots
 that
 are
 great
 surgeons


than
 there
 are


>> all
 surgeons
 on
 Earth.


>> And
 the
 cost
 of
 that
 but
 that's
 an


important
 statement
 in
 3
 years
 time.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 because
 medicine
 I
 mean
 absolutely


if
 it's
 four
 or
 five
 years
 who
 cares.


It's
 still
 an


>> extreme
 precision.


>> Yes.


>> Three
 years.
 Um,


yes.
 Better
 than
 any
 any
 probably
 I'd


say
 if
 you
 like
 put
 a
 little
 margin
 on


it.
 Better
 than
 any
 human
 in
 four
 years


>> who's
 in
 plastic
 surgery.
 5
 years
 is
 not


even
 close.


>> I
 think
 your
 point
 was
 medicine
 is
 going


to
 be
 effectively
 free.
 The
 best


medicine
 in
 the
 world.


>> Everyone
 will
 have
 access
 to
 medical


care
 that
 is
 better
 than
 what
 the


president
 receives
 right
 now.


>> So
 don't
 go
 to
 medical
 school.


>> Yes.
 Pointless.


>> Yeah.
 pointless
 going
 to
 medical
 school.


>> Look,
 he
 knows
 way
 more
 about
 this
 than


I
 do.
 I
 would
 also
 say
 that
 I
 think
 both


the
 incentive
 structure
 and
 his
 personal


temperament
 lean
 towards
 a
 kind
 of


optimism
 and
 there's
 a
 sales
 dimension


to
 this
 as
 well,
 obviously,
 cuz
 he's
 one


of
 the
 people
 producing
 the
 stuff.
 So,


his
 optimism
 may
 be
 a
 product
 of
 the


incentive
 structure
 that
 he's
 subject


to.
 But
 even
 if
 it's
 not
 3
 years,


I
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 more
 than
 10
 years.


So,
 that's
 the
 time
 frame.
 And
 given
 how


long
 it
 takes
 to
 train
 to
 become
 a


doctor.
 Yeah.


>> I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 situation
 in


Iran.


>> We're
 seeing
 what
 one
 might
 call
 an


uprising
 at
 the
 moment
 where
 protesters


are
 are
 on
 the
 street
 in
 a
 country
 where


it
 is
 very
 very
 dangerous
 um
 and
 also


very
 brave
 to
 protest
 against
 the


leadership
 there.
 Where
 does
 this
 fit
 in


the
 broader
 context?
 What
 what
 the
 hell


is
 going
 on?


>> I
 am
 not
 an
 expert
 on
 Iran,
 but


effectively
 what's
 happening
 in
 Iran
 is


an
 attempted
 counterrevolution.
 So
 they


had
 a
 revolution
 in
 1979.
 They
 overthrew


the
 ruler,
 the
 sha,
 and
 they
 replaced


him
 with
 a
 an
 Islamic
 dictatorship,


which
 is
 what
 you've
 had
 since
 1979.
 And


the
 people
 of
 Iran
 have
 attempted
 to


overthrow
 this
 Islamic
 dictatorship


repeatedly.
 They've
 always
 been
 brutally


suppressed.
 And
 that's
 basically
 what's


happening
 now
 again.


>> And
 is
 does
 this
 fit
 somewhere
 into
 the


broader
 conflict
 of
 geopolitics
 in
 the


US,
 the
 multipol?
 Well,
 only
 in
 the


sense
 that
 you
 can
 see
 that
 even


President
 Trump,
 who's
 talked
 quite


brashly
 about
 what
 he
 might
 do
 if
 this


sort
 of
 gets
 out
 of
 hand,
 is
 still
 not


as
 we
 speak
 doing
 anything
 about
 it
 on
 a


on
 a
 kind
 of
 kinetic
 level.
 And
 that's


partly
 for
 the
 reasons
 that
 we
 talked


about
 earlier,
 which
 is
 the
 United


States
 is
 deeply
 deeply
 the
 United


States
 public
 are
 deeply
 deeply


skeptical
 about
 foreign
 interventions.


And
 so
 the
 idea
 that
 we
 that
 we
 the
 West


would
 support
 a
 a
 regime
 change
 in
 Iran


is
 not
 something
 that
 you
 can
 sell
 to


the
 American
 people
 right
 now.
 And
 so
 he


has
 to
 be
 he
 has
 to
 be
 much
 more
 careful


about
 what
 he
 might
 otherwise
 have
 done


in
 Iran.
 And
 so
 because
 of
 that,
 the


leaders
 of
 Iran
 probably
 feel
 like


they're
 in
 a
 better
 position
 to
 crack


down
 and
 survive
 versus
 what
 might
 have


happened
 in
 the
 past.
 I
 mean,
 Trump's


been
 quite
 vocal
 in
 what
 he
 might
 do
 in


his
 threats.
 He
 said
 that
 the
 US
 would


come
 to
 the
 protesters
 rescue,
 that
 we


are
 locked,
 loaded,
 and
 ready
 to
 go.
 He


announced
 that
 countries
 doing
 business


with
 Iran,
 faced
 a
 25%
 tariff
 on
 their


trade
 with
 the
 US,
 ramping
 up
 pressure.


>> And
 he
 called
 for
 Iranians
 to
 keep


protesting.


Um,
 and
 then
 more
 recently,
 he
 said,


"I've
 canceled
 all
 meetings
 with
 Iranian


officials
 until
 the
 senseless
 killing
 of


protest
 stops.
 Help
 is
 on
 the
 way.
 Mag


mega,


>> make
 Iran
 great."
 Well,
 Iran,
 you
 know,


I
 mean,
 one
 thing
 that
 should
 be
 said
 is


the
 Persian
 Empire
 and
 the
 Persian


people
 are
 a
 great
 people
 with
 a
 very


rich
 history.
 And
 what's
 interesting
 is


in
 attempting
 to
 over
 I
 don't know
 if


you've
 ever
 seen
 pictures
 from
 Tehran


from
 before
 1979,
 it's
 like
 women


walking
 around
 in
 miniskirts
 and
 and
 all


the
 rest
 of
 it.
 So,
 they
 have
 a
 very


long
 history
 of
 freedom
 in
 a
 way
 that
 we


don't
 tend
 to
 think
 of
 the
 Middle
 East


as
 having
 today.
 uh
 and
 that's
 that's


that's
 an
 example
 of
 how
 it's
 perhaps


different
 from
 other
 parts
 of
 the
 Middle


East.
 But
 you
 can
 see
 the
 the
 reluctance


to
 actually
 do
 anything
 about
 it
 because


the
 question
 is
 well
 let's
 say
 you
 do


remove
 the
 current
 leadership.
 Let's
 say


you
 bring
 back
 the
 son
 of
 the
 former


Shah
 Resa
 he
 oversees
 a
 transition
 to


some
 kind
 of
 democratic
 thing.
 Who
 is


there
 protecting
 that
 process
 from
 being


disrupted
 by
 the
 remnants
 of
 the
 old


regime?
 Who's
 going
 to
 do
 that?
 Is
 there


American
 boots
 on
 the
 ground?
 Cuz


there's
 literally
 zero
 appetite
 for
 that


in
 America.
 That's
 the
 challenge
 that
 I


think
 he
 faces,
 which
 is
 probably
 why
 he


hasn't
 done
 anything.


>> And
 how
 do
 you
 think
 the
 story
 plays


out?


>> No
 idea,
 mate.
 No
 idea.
 I
 I I
 have
 no


idea
 what
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 here.
 I


fear
 unfortunately
 that
 what
 the
 regime


will
 do
 I'm
 not
 saying
 this
 is
 what
 will


happen
 but
 my
 fear
 is
 and
 it's
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 that
 I
 am


I
 sympathize
 so
 deeply
 with
 the
 Iranian


people
 that
 are
 rising
 up
 against
 the


oppression
 but
 I
 am
 wary
 of
 encouraging


encouraging
 them
 unless
 we
 are
 willing


to
 back
 them
 fully.
 This
 is
 exactly
 in


in
 a
 way
 that
 what
 happened
 with


Ukraine.
 There
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 rah
 rah


rahrh
 and
 there
 was
 not
 nearly
 enough


support
 to
 actually
 help
 them
 defend


their
 country.
 My
 fear
 is
 there
 will
 be


a
 lot
 of
 rah.
 We
 support
 the
 Ukrainian


people.
 We
 stand
 with
 them
 blah
 blah,


you
 know,
 blah
 blah
 blah.
 But
 ultimately


the
 regime
 will
 kill
 more
 of
 them
 and
 it


will
 kill
 enough
 of
 them
 for
 this
 to
 go


away.
 That's
 my
 worry.


>> Well,
 I
 hope
 the
 world
 does
 come
 to
 the


support
 of
 the
 Iranians.
 I
 really
 do.


>> Me
 too.
 because
 for
 all
 the
 reasons


you've
 said,
 beautiful
 country,


beautiful
 people,
 and
 um
 it's
 it's


horrific
 to
 see
 what's
 going
 on.
 There's


varying
 estimates.
 It's
 unfortunately
 we


we
 don't
 have
 accurate
 numbers
 because
 I


mean
 the
 internet
 is
 down
 and
 it's


always
 hard
 to
 get
 accurate
 numbers
 in


the
 situation,
 but
 I've
 heard
 estimates


ranging
 from
 2,000
 to
 18,000
 people


being
 killed.
 And
 uh
 it's
 inconceivable


I
 think
 for
 Westerners
 like
 us
 to


understand
 what
 it
 is
 to
 live
 in
 an


environment
 like
 that.


>> Which
 is
 why
 they're
 protesting
 as


courageously
 as
 they
 are.
 I
 just
 hope


that
 the
 geopolitical
 realities
 allow
 us


to
 support
 them
 in
 the
 way
 that
 we
 keep


saying
 we
 would.
 Do
 you
 see
 what
 I'm


saying?


>> Yeah,
 of
 course.
 Yeah.
 And
 this
 is
 Yeah.


>> And
 this
 is
 my
 big
 worry.
 We
 have
 we


have
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 this.
 We
 stand
 with


you.
 We
 support
 you.
 And
 then
 when
 push


comes
 to
 shove,


the
 realities
 of
 the
 thing
 come
 into


play
 and
 suddenly
 we're
 a
 lot
 more


careful
 about
 it.


>> Trump
 seems
 to
 walk
 the
 walk
 more
 so


than
 others.


>> Absolutely.


>> And
 he
 seems
 to
 It's
 funny
 because
 I


think
 it
 was
 Biden
 that
 said
 to
 China


that
 if
 they
 took
 back
 Taiwan,
 he
 would


get
 involved.


>> Trump
 didn't
 say
 that.


>> He's
 kind
 of
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 some


quotes
 from
 Trump
 and
 it
 seems
 like
 he's


basically
 like,
 well,
 if
 they
 take


Taiwan
 back,
 I
 ain't
 going
 to
 get


involved.
 But
 in
 other
 instances
 where


he
 warns
 countries
 that
 he'll
 bomb
 them


or
 take
 action.
 Yeah.


>> Like
 Venezuela
 or
 like
 Iran
 with
 the
 the


nuclear
 weapon
 situation,
 he
 does
 seem


to
 follow
 through.


>> And
 I
 Marco
 Rubio
 and
 Hegathth
 were


saying
 the
 other
 day
 in
 the
 interview
 I


was
 watching
 that
 listen
 when
 when
 is


the
 world
 going
 to
 learn?
 If
 Trump
 says


something,
 he's
 going
 to
 do
 it.
 And
 you


know
 him
 saying
 that
 we
 will
 come
 to


your
 rescue.


>> Well,
 hopefully
 they
 come
 through
 on


that,
 but
 also
 hopefully
 they
 have
 a


plan
 for
 what
 happens
 after
 that.


>> Yeah.
 And
 this
 is
 the
 mistake
 we've


obviously
 made
 in
 a
 number
 of
 countries,


Libya,
 Iraq,


Afghanistan,


Syria,
 which
 is
 now
 basically
 headed
 by


a
 jihadi.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 Where
 we
 go,
 oh
 yeah,
 we've
 got


to
 remove
 this
 terrible
 guy
 and
 yeah,


he's
 terrible
 guy
 and
 we're
 right
 to


remove
 him.
 But
 then
 what
 do
 you
 end
 up


with
 afterwards?
 So
 if
 they
 do
 help
 the


Iranian
 people,
 which
 I
 hope
 they
 have,


they
 have
 the
 plans
 to
 do,
 then
 I
 hope


they
 have
 a
 plan
 for
 what
 happens
 after


that
 and
 how
 you
 get
 Iran
 to
 a
 position


where
 the
 people
 of
 Iran
 get
 to
 choose


their
 own
 leaders
 and
 those
 leaders
 stay


in
 power
 and
 those
 leaders
 are
 the
 sorts


of
 people
 that
 you
 might
 want
 to
 see
 in


charge
 because
 you
 know
 this
 happened
 in


Egypt.
 They
 they
 they
 have
 the
 Arab


Spring.
 They
 overthrow
 the
 evil
 dictator


and
 what
 do
 they
 do?
 they
 elect
 the


Muslim
 Brotherhood
 and
 then
 the
 people


go
 no
 no no
 no
 we
 need
 the
 military
 back


etc.
 So
 these
 are
 not
 easy
 problems
 to


solve
 which
 is
 why
 people
 are
 being


careful
 about
 it.
 So
 I
 hope
 they
 have
 a


a
 plan
 and
 a
 solution
 for
 what
 comes


after
 if
 they
 in
 fact
 act


>> and
 Trump's
 also
 talking
 about
 taking


Greenland


>> which
 is
 the
 first
 time
 I
 heard
 him
 say


that
 I
 thought
 he
 was
 joking.
 I
 thought


this
 is
 just
 a
 funny
 Trump,
 you
 know,


when
 he
 was
 talking
 about
 taking
 Canada.


>> Yeah,


>> it
 was
 he
 was
 calling
 it
 the
 great
 state


of
 Canada.
 I
 thought
 this
 was
 him
 just


joking.
 But
 in
 more
 recent
 times,
 in
 the


last
 week,
 I
 heard
 him
 say
 in
 an


interview,
 "We're
 going to
 do
 it
 the


easy
 way
 or
 the
 hard
 way."
 Words
 to
 that


effect.


>> What's
 going
 on?


>> Well,
 we
 talked
 about
 they're
 trying
 to


protect
 their
 sphere
 of
 influence
 in


North
 America
 and
 South
 America,
 and


they
 they
 want
 they
 want
 they
 want
 to


have
 the
 military
 bases
 there
 that
 they


want
 to
 have
 there.
 They
 want
 to
 have


the
 resources
 and
 access
 to
 that.


>> Are
 we
 returning
 to
 empires?


>> We
 never
 left
 empire.
 This
 is
 the
 This


is
 the
 great
 thing
 that
 we
 we've
 been


living
 in
 the
 dream
 world.
 We've
 been


pretending
 these
 things
 haven't
 been


going
 on
 the
 entire
 time.
 They
 have.
 The


world's
 always
 been
 like
 this.


There
 was
 a
 brief
 moment
 after
 World
 War


II
 when
 it
 wasn't
 like
 this
 because
 we


were
 fighting
 the
 Soviet
 Union.
 And
 the


Soviet
 Union,
 the
 battle
 in
 the
 Cold
 War


was
 very
 similar.
 There
 was
 proxy
 wars


all
 over
 the
 place
 between
 those
 two


great
 powers.
 Right
 now
 there's
 two


different
 great
 powers
 and
 a
 third


smaller
 power
 in
 Russia
 and
 India
 is


rising
 as
 well
 who
 are
 all
 trying
 to


make
 their
 moves
 and
 all
 Trump
 is
 doing


is
 saying
 well
 we
 are
 not
 going
 to
 play


by
 the
 fake
 rules
 anymore
 that
 no
 one


else
 is
 playing
 by
 anyway.


>> And
 so
 is
 Trump
 endeavoring
 to
 take
 that


part
 of
 the
 world
 take
 control
 of
 that?


>> Take
 control.
 Yeah.
 In
 many
 ways,
 it's


what
 every
 great
 power
 seeks
 to
 do
 is
 to


control
 its
 neighbors
 so
 that
 they
 don't


have
 foreign
 influence
 in
 their
 backyard


so
 that
 they
 have
 the
 strategic


advantage
 in
 that
 area.
 Um,
 it's
 the
 way


of
 the
 world.


>> I
 mean,
 I
 didn't
 hear
 this
 rhetoric
 for


the
 other
 30
 years
 of
 my
 life.


>> Yeah.


>> As
 explicitly.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 when
 you
 say
 multipolar,


what
 are
 the
 polls?


>> Well,
 it's
 the
 US
 and
 China.


>> Yeah.
 are
 the
 two
 Russia
 wants
 to
 claim


it's
 a
 third
 one
 and
 then
 you
 will
 see


the
 rise
 of
 India
 I
 think
 over
 time
 as


well
 India
 is
 a
 lot
 more
 sensible
 about


these
 things
 about
 the
 way
 that
 they're


developing


>> and
 is
 is
 the
 multipolar
 world
 a
 good


thing
 or
 a
 bad
 thing
 or
 is
 it
 just


indifferent


>> for
 whom


>> for
 let's
 do
 people
 living
 in
 Europe


>> I
 think
 it's
 likely
 to
 be
 a
 very
 bad


thing
 for
 people
 living
 in
 Europe


because
 we
 become
 less
 powerful
 less


wealthy
 less
 relevant


uh
 for
 the
 reasons
 we've
 already


discussed.
 We
 could
 change
 it
 if
 we


wanted
 to.


>> How


>> we
 could
 uh
 abandon
 our
 suicidal


economic
 policy.
 So
 we
 could
 have


economic
 growth
 again
 which
 would


increase
 our
 share
 of
 GDP.
 We
 would
 make


our
 people
 more
 prosperous.
 It
 would


help
 to
 quell
 domestic
 unease.


>> Part
 of
 which
 has
 been
 created
 by
 mass


immigration.
 People
 care
 about
 that
 more


because
 they're
 poorer.
 Right?
 If
 we


were
 growing,
 then
 everybody's
 a
 little


bit
 happier.
 It's
 like
 you
 move
 to
 LA,


the
 sunshine
 is
 nice,
 everybody's
 a


little
 bit
 happier.
 When
 you're
 getting


richer,
 everybody's
 a
 little
 bit


happier.
 So,
 that's
 one
 of
 them.
 The


second
 one
 is
 you've
 got
 to
 recognize


that
 the
 huge
 waves
 of
 immigration
 we


have
 had
 uh
 have
 brought
 some
 positives.


They've
 also
 brought
 a
 tremendous
 amount


of
 cultural
 instability.
 People
 feel


like
 their
 country
 is
 changing.
 They


never
 voted
 for
 it.
 In
 fact,
 they


repeatedly
 voted
 against
 it.
 So
 you
 have


to
 arrest
 the
 sense
 that
 our
 country
 is


ceasing
 to
 be
 one
 place
 and
 instead


we're
 becoming
 different
 communities,


right?
 The
 this
 community,
 the
 that


community.
 Instead,
 we've
 got
 to
 go
 to
 a


place
 where
 we're
 all
 British
 or
 we're


all
 American
 or
 we're
 all
 French
 or


whatever
 it
 is,
 we've
 got
 to
 integrate


fully
 the
 people
 have
 already
 arrived.


And
 to
 do
 that,
 you
 have
 to
 make
 sure


you
 don't
 continue
 to
 have
 the
 same


scale
 of
 inflows
 that
 we've
 had.
 You


have
 to
 deal
 with
 illegal
 immigration.


You
 have
 to
 stop
 that
 from
 happening


because
 that
 that
 really
 affects
 how


people
 feel
 about
 sense
 of
 fairness
 and


a
 commitment
 and
 loyalty
 to
 their


country.
 One
 of
 the
 reasons
 if
 you
 talk


to
 young
 people
 they
 they'll
 say
 they're


disillusioned,
 they
 won't
 fight
 for


their
 country,
 etc.
 is
 they
 feel
 like


well
 their
 country
 doesn't
 care
 about


them.
 It's
 bringing
 in
 people
 that
 it's


paying
 to
 have
 a
 house
 and
 and
 so
 all


the
 rest
 of
 it
 while
 they
 can't
 get
 on


the
 property
 letter.
 So
 you've
 got
 to


deal
 with
 immigration
 as
 a
 whole


package.
 Then
 you
 have
 to
 rebuild
 your


military.
 You
 have
 to
 rebuild
 your


military
 capacity.


And
 then
 you
 have
 to
 understand
 the
 new


world
 in
 which
 we
 live
 and
 really
 pick
 a


team
 and
 say
 which
 alliances
 are
 we


going
 to
 nurture.
 In
 my
 opinion
 the
 best


thing
 Britain
 could
 do
 is
 to
 nurture
 the


alliance
 with
 the
 United
 States
 to
 make


itself
 relevant
 within
 that
 alliance
 for


in
 the
 ways
 that
 I've
 already
 talked


about
 and
 then
 join
 forces
 with
 the
 US


and
 recognize
 that
 we
 have
 very
 similar


interests
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 and
 if
 we


were
 prepared
 to
 act
 like
 it
 then
 we'd


be
 in
 a
 much
 better
 place.


And
 also
 you
 got
 to
 have
 more
 kids.


A
 lot
 more
 kids.


>> Why?


>> Uh
 if
 you
 if
 you
 look
 at
 forget
 about


the
 moral
 kind
 of
 sensibilities
 and


politically
 correct
 stuff
 about
 it,
 the


more
 people
 you
 have,
 the
 more
 powerful


you
 are
 comparative
 all
 other
 things


being
 equal,
 right?
 A
 country
 with
 more


people
 is
 more
 powerful
 than
 a
 country


with
 fewer
 people.
 Just
 if
 everything


else
 is
 the
 same.
 But
 more
 importantly,


our
 dem
 we're
 in
 a
 demographic
 death


spiral.
 And
 this
 is
 one
 of the
 reasons


we
 have
 had
 mass
 immigration.


Politicians
 won't
 tell
 you
 the
 honest


truth
 of
 it.
 But
 the
 real
 reason
 is
 they


keep
 bringing
 in
 hundreds
 of
 thousands


of
 people
 is
 if
 they
 don't,
 we
 will
 see


the
 reality
 which
 is
 that
 we're
 getting


poorer
 all
 the
 time.
 But
 if
 they
 bring


in
 a
 mass
 of
 people
 from
 outside,
 they


can
 say
 that
 the
 economy
 is
 growing
 not


because
 it's
 growing
 on
 a
 per
 capita


basis,
 but
 because
 you've
 simply
 added


more
 people
 to
 the
 population.
 And
 if
 if


if
 this
 is
 seems
 abstract,
 think
 about


it
 like
 this.
 Let's
 say
 you
 have


uh
 you
 have
 a
 family,
 you,
 your


girlfriend,
 and
 you've
 got
 two
 kids,


right?
 And
 your
 total
 household
 income


is
 £100,000
 a
 year,
 let's
 say,
 for
 the


four
 of
 you.
 Now,
 let's
 say
 you
 bring
 in


your
 in-laws.
 They
 live
 in
 the
 same


house,
 right?
 They
 don't
 earn
 anything.


Let's
 say
 they
 own
 10
 grand
 a
 year
 each.


So
 now
 your
 household
 income
 is


£120,000.
 So
 you've
 got
 richer,
 haven't


you?


>> No,
 you've
 now
 got
 six
 people
 to
 spread


that
 money
 over
 and
 now
 you're
 per


person
 a
 lot
 poorer.
 That's
 what
 British


and
 European
 leaders
 have
 done
 so
 that


they
 could
 pretend
 that
 we're
 not


getting
 poorer
 all
 the
 time.
 That's
 why


they've
 done
 it.
 Uh
 this
 is
 what
 they


say.
 We
 need
 people
 to
 come
 and
 do
 the


jobs.
 That
 that's
 what
 they
 mean.
 They


mean
 we
 need
 to
 bring
 in
 more
 people
 so


we
 can
 tell
 you
 the
 economy
 has
 grown
 by


0.3%.


While
 you've
 been
 getting
 poorer.
 So


you've
 got
 to
 address
 the
 economic
 side


of
 this
 as
 well
 of
 the
 demographic


thing.
 And
 the
 third
 thing
 actually
 is


societies
 with
 lots
 of
 kids
 kids
 are


just
 much
 more
 dynamic
 than
 societies


without
 them.
 You
 know,
 you
 get
 very


stale
 when
 you've
 got
 too
 many
 older


people.
 You
 need
 that
 young
 energy,
 that


young
 blood.
 You
 need
 young
 people.
 You


need
 children
 around.
 Uh
 and
 then
 they


will
 of
 course
 be
 the
 next
 generation
 to


drive
 things
 forward.
 So
 you
 we've
 got


to
 have
 loads
 more
 loads
 more
 kids.


>> New
 year
 always
 has
 a
 strange
 energy
 to


it
 because
 people
 start
 talking
 about


their
 goals,
 fresh
 starts,
 and
 new


habits.
 But
 the
 reality
 is
 that
 most


people
 carry
 the
 same
 ideas
 they
 had


last
 year
 into
 the
 new
 year.
 I'm
 guilty


of
 that,
 too.
 And
 they
 still
 don't
 end


up
 doing
 anything
 with
 them.
 And
 I
 get


why.
 Starting
 something
 new,
 especially


if
 it's
 a
 business
 or
 a
 project,
 is


overwhelming.
 Before
 you
 start,
 you're


looking
 for
 the
 perfect
 moment
 and
 to
 be


the
 perfect
 version
 of
 yourself.
 When


really
 what
 matters
 most
 is
 taking
 that


first
 step.
 If
 you've
 had
 an
 idea
 for
 a


while,
 a
 product,
 a
 store,
 something


you've
 been
 sitting
 on,
 our
 sponsor


Shopify
 makes
 it
 easy
 to
 get
 started


because
 you
 can
 build
 your
 store,
 sell


on
 socials,
 take
 payments,
 use
 AI
 tools,


and
 manage
 everything
 all
 in
 one
 place.


So,
 if
 2026
 is
 the
 year
 you
 finally
 back


yourself,
 go
 to
 shopify.co.uk/bartlet


and
 start
 selling.
 And
 you
 can
 sign
 up


for
 a
 $1
 per
 month
 trial
 right
 now,
 too.


Just
 go
 to
 shopify.co.uk/
 UK/bartlet.


I
 promise
 you,
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 have
 it


all
 figured
 out.
 You
 just
 need
 to
 start.


You
 know,
 every
 once
 in
 a
 while,
 you


come
 across
 a
 product
 that
 has
 such
 a


huge
 impact
 on
 your
 life
 that
 you'd


probably
 describe
 as
 a
 gamecher.
 And
 I


would
 say
 for
 about
 35
 to
 40%
 of
 my


team,
 they
 would
 currently
 describe
 this


product
 that
 I
 have
 in
 front
 of
 me


called
 Ketone
 IQ,
 which
 you
 can
 get
 at


ketone.com,


as
 a
 game
 changer.
 But
 the
 reason
 I


became
 a
 co-owner
 of
 this
 company
 and


the
 reason
 why
 they
 they
 now
 are
 a


sponsor
 of
 this
 podcast
 is
 because
 one


day
 when
 I
 came
 to
 work,
 there
 was
 a
 box


of
 this
 stuff
 sat
 on
 my
 desk.
 I
 had
 no


idea
 what
 it
 was.
 Lily
 and
 my
 team
 says


that
 this
 company
 have
 been
 in
 touch.
 So


I
 went
 upstairs,
 tried
 it,
 and
 quite


frankly,
 the
 rest
 is
 history.
 in
 terms


of
 my
 focus,
 my
 energy
 levels,
 how
 I


feel,
 how
 I
 work,
 how
 productive
 I
 am.


Game
 changer.

 you

 You'll

across
 the
 United
 States
 where
 your

And
 what
 do
 you
 think
 of
 Kier
 Starmmer


and
 the
 way
 he's
 leading
 the
 UK?


>> It's
 very
 tempting
 always.
 We
 come
 back


to
 the
 Biden
 Trump
 left
 right
 thing
 to


put
 the
 blame
 on
 one
 specific
 person.
 I


don't
 think
 he's
 doing
 a
 good
 job
 for


the
 reasons
 that
 I
 told
 you.
 We
 we've


got
 the
 highest
 tax
 burden
 in
 peace
 time


history.
 So,
 he's
 driving
 business


through
 the
 floor.
 I
 know
 that
 you
 will


we
 you
 and
 I
 have
 never
 spoken
 about


this,
 but
 I
 bet
 you
 could
 name
 50
 people


off
 the
 top
 of
 your
 head
 who've
 left
 the


UK
 to
 go
 to
 other
 places,
 who
 run


businesses.
 You're
 nodding,
 right,
 for


people
 listening.
 But
 why
 is
 that


happening?
 because
 the
 business
 climate


here
 is
 not
 good.


>> Mhm.


>> The
 taxes
 here
 are
 very
 high
 and
 also


the
 quality
 of
 life
 here
 is
 declined.


>> And
 generally,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 maybe


the
 first
 point
 you
 said
 about
 climate,


there's
 a
 pessimism.


>> Yes.


>> Why
 is
 that?
 Why
 is
 that?


>> It's
 self-fulfilling.


>> Yes.


>> It's
 like
 a
 self-fulfilling
 pessimism


where
 founders
 who
 are
 in
 my
 portfolio


that
 I've
 invested
 in
 will
 come
 to
 me


and
 say,
 "Hi,
 you
 know,
 we've
 just
 sold


uh
 10%
 of
 the
 business
 for
 20
 million."


Yeah.


>> And
 then
 the
 next
 sentence
 will
 be
 their


escape
 plan.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 that
 didn't
 used
 to
 happen
 even
 10


years
 ago.


>> And
 that's
 because
 of
 government
 policy.


That's
 the
 only
 way
 that
 this
 happens.


Right?
 Because
 if
 the
 government
 a
 keeps


taxing
 you
 up
 to
 your
 eyeballs
 and
 b


keeps
 telling
 you
 that
 you
 are
 evil,


which
 is
 what
 it
 does,
 right?
 If
 you're


rich
 in
 Britain,
 you
 are
 evil.
 That's


the
 that's
 the
 algorithm
 we
 have.
 And
 we


treat
 successful
 people.
 We
 immediately


assume
 that
 they're
 privileged
 people.


Well,
 my
 pet
 theory
 is
 that
 this
 goes


back
 to
 the
 land
 of
 gentry.
 The
 idea


that
 in
 this
 country
 if
 you
 were
 rich,


there
 was
 a
 time
 when
 that
 was
 almost


certainly
 because
 your
 dad
 was
 rich
 or


at least
 people
 thought
 that.
 And
 so


this
 sense
 that
 if
 someone
 is
 successful


economically,
 financially,
 it's
 probably


because
 they've
 benefited
 from
 some
 sort


of
 illotten
 privilege.
 It
 permeates


everything.
 In
 America,
 people
 don't


feel
 that
 way.
 They
 go,
 "You've
 been


successful
 because
 you've
 worked
 really


hard
 and
 you've
 had
 a
 great
 idea.
 I'd


love
 to
 learn
 from
 you.
 I'd
 love
 to
 be


more
 like
 you."
 In
 Britain,
 we
 go,


"You've
 been
 successful.
 You
 know,
 we


got
 to
 tax
 you."
 So,
 if
 the
 government


keeps
 taxing
 you
 and
 then
 telling
 you


you're
 a
 bad
 person
 while
 you
 pay
 the


overwhelming
 share
 of
 the
 taxes
 in
 the


country,
 it's
 not
 a
 great
 place
 to
 be.


You
 know,
 if
 I
 come
 home
 tonight
 and
 my


wife
 says,
 "Yeah,
 you
 earn
 all
 the


money,
 but
 you're
 a
 dick
 and
 I
 don't


like
 you."
 And


after
 a
 while,
 you
 sort
 of
 go,
 well,
 if


this
 isn't
 working,
 I'll
 go
 somewhere


where
 I'm
 wanted.
 Do
 you
 know
 what
 I


mean?
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 what's


happening
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 most
 driven,


the
 most
 talented,
 the
 most
 successful,


the
 most
 creative
 people.
 And
 so,
 we're


driving
 out
 the
 business,
 we're
 driving


out
 the
 entrepreneurs.
 Then
 on
 the


industrial
 side
 of
 it,
 we
 talked
 about


it
 before,
 net
 zero
 basically
 means
 that


any
 energyintensive
 business
 is


completely
 unviable
 in
 Britain.
 And
 I'm


sure
 you've
 seen
 this
 with
 AI
 and
 lots


of
 other
 things.
 you
 go
 to
 where
 you
 can


do
 your
 business.
 Then
 on
 top
 of
 that


you
 add
 regulation
 particularly
 in
 in


Europe
 which
 restricts
 your
 ability
 to


do
 things
 again.
 So
 there's
 this
 um
 you


and
 it
 didn't
 didn't
 have
 to
 be
 like


that.
 It
 wasn't
 like
 that
 in
 the
 '9s
 in


this
 country,
 right?
 There
 was
 a


positive
 go-getter
 business
 climate
 and


you
 can
 do
 that
 again.
 You
 just
 have
 to


have
 a
 leader
 who
 is
 willing
 to
 do
 that.


And
 SAM
 is
 the
 opposite
 of
 that.
 And


part
 of
 the
 reason
 is
 that
 they
 simply


can't
 do
 anything
 about
 the
 fact
 that
 we


are
 spending
 huge
 amounts
 of
 money
 uh


keeping
 lots
 and
 lots
 of
 people
 trapped


in
 welfare
 against
 in
 many
 ways
 against


their
 interest
 and
 actually
 in
 some
 ways


I
 would
 argue
 even
 against
 their
 will


because
 and
 I've
 made
 this
 point
 before


if
 you
 said
 to
 you're
 a
 very
 driven


person.
 I'm
 a
 very
 driven
 person,
 but


when
 I
 was
 in
 my
 early
 20s,
 if
 you'd


said
 to
 me,
 "You
 don't
 need
 to
 work."


You
 know,
 I
 know
 you're
 feeling
 a
 bit


depressed,
 as
 I
 was
 in
 my
 early
 20s.
 I


wasn't
 sure
 what
 I
 was
 doing
 with
 life.


You're
 a
 bit
 depressed.
 You're
 a
 bit


anxious.
 I
 remember
 going
 to
 apply
 for
 a


job
 and
 just
 sweating
 buckets
 cuz
 I
 was


so
 anxious.
 Right.
 Well,
 you've
 got


anxiety,
 you've
 got
 depression,
 you


can't
 work.
 We'll
 give
 you
 20
 grand
 a


year
 and
 you
 can
 just,
 you
 know,
 we'll


write
 you
 off
 and
 you
 just
 sit
 home,


play
 on
 the
 PlayStation,
 smoke
 weed.
 I


would
 have
 taken
 that.
 Most
 people
 would


have
 taken
 that.
 And
 that's
 the
 position


we
 have
 put
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 young
 people


in.
 Uh
 we
 just
 ride
 them
 off.
 We
 give


them
 benefits
 and
 we
 forget
 about
 them.


And
 that
 welfare
 bill
 has
 become
 a


unsustainable,
 but
 it's
 also
 uncutable.


They
 try
 the
 Labor
 government
 tried
 to


cut
 it.
 They
 tried
 to
 reform
 welfare
 and


their
 own
 backbenches
 revolted
 and
 they


caved
 and
 they
 said,
 "No,
 no,
 no.
 We're


not
 going
 to
 reform
 welfare.
 We're
 going


to
 tax
 the
 rich
 because
 the
 rich,
 you


know,
 don't
 pay
 enough
 tax."
 when
 in
 the


reality
 I
 think
 the
 top
 you
 maybe
 look


this
 up
 10
 the
 top
 10%
 of
 taxpayers
 in


this
 country
 pay


I
 think
 more
 than
 half
 of
 all
 the
 tax


probably
 significantly
 more
 than
 half
 of


all
 the
 tax
 but
 look
 it
 up
 I
 think
 the


top
 1%
 pay
 33%
 of
 all
 the
 tax
 fact
 check


me
 on
 this


>> okay
 so
 the
 top
 10%
 of
 taxpayers


pay
 60%
 of
 all
 income
 tax


>> yeah
 and
 also
 um
 what's
 the
 other
 one


the
 capital
 gains
 as
 well.
 If
 you
 look


up
 capital
 gains,
 it's
 basically
 the


same.
 So
 if
 you
 put
 those
 two
 together,


which
 is
 basically
 what
 we
 pay
 on


earning,
 the
 top
 10%
 pay
 60%
 of
 it.
 So


what
 happens
 when
 you
 chase
 out
 those


people,
 which
 is
 what
 we're
 doing.
 What


happens
 to
 your
 tax
 base?
 You
 get
 less


and
 less
 tax.
 That
 means
 you
 have
 to
 tax


the
 people
 who
 haven't
 left
 yet
 more
 and


more
 in
 order
 to
 pay
 people
 who
 are
 not


who
 are
 net
 consumers
 of
 tax
 revenues.


According
 to
 HM
 revenue
 and
 customs
 data


in
 the
 UK,
 the
 top
 1%
 pay
 30%
 of
 all


income.


>> I
 said
 33.
 So
 30.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 So
 what
 happens
 when
 you
 say
 that


1%
 are
 evil
 and
 they
 must
 pay
 more?
 1%


pay
 30%
 of
 all
 the
 tax.


>> It's
 funny.
 I'm
 quite
 a
 torn
 person
 on


this
 subject
 because
 I
 I
 represent
 kind


of
 two
 sides
 of
 this
 argument.
 The
 first


side
 of
 the
 argument,
 I
 just
 have
 this


sort
 of
 visceral
 memory
 of
 being
 sat
 at


my
 desk
 in
 Mosside
 with
 these
 like
 baiff


letters
 on
 my
 right,
 this
 smashed
 up


laptop
 on
 my
 left,
 knowing
 that
 I
 had
 no


way
 of
 eating
 that
 day
 and
 thinking,


"Oh,
 I
 you
 know
 what
 I
 need
 to
 do?


There's
 this
 thing
 called
 jobsekers


allowance."


>> And
 I
 was
 like
 messing
 with
 the
 do
 I


join
 it
 cuz
 like
 right
 now
 I'm
 like


scavenging
 for
 pound
 coins
 to
 see
 if
 I


can
 buy
 some
 Chinese
 from
 Young
 Dar


Takeaway.
 And
 I
 printed
 off
 the
 forms


and
 the
 forms
 were
 there
 in
 front
 of
 me


on
 the
 desk
 to
 apply
 for
 jobsekers


allowance
 when
 I
 was
 maybe
 18
 years
 old,


roughly
 that
 age,
 18,
 19
 years
 old.
 And


because
 I
 got
 so
 close,
 I
 have
 the
 huge


amount
 of
 empathy
 for
 people
 that


>> get
 to
 that
 point.
 And
 then
 on
 the
 other


side,
 because
 I'm
 now
 in
 a
 different


world


>> and
 I
 I'm
 around
 entrepreneurs
 so
 much


who
 are


>> so
 so
 frequently
 telling
 me
 their
 escape


plan
 from
 the
 UK
 that
 I
 feel
 the
 need
 to


let
 the
 average
 the
 the
 normal
 person


that's
 listening
 to
 this
 podcast
 that


maybe
 doesn't
 have
 the
 access
 to


entrepreneurs
 or
 the
 inside


conversations
 that
 that
 I
 have
 with


entrepreneurs
 know
 that
 when
 people
 come


on
 the
 show
 and
 tell
 you
 that
 rich


people
 will
 leave,
 it
 is
 my
 experience


that
 rich
 people
 leave
 and
 like
 because


there
 there
 is
 an
 argument
 ongoing


argument
 no
 they
 won't
 leave
 and
 there


people
 point
 out
 different
 things
 no


they
 they
 leave
 they
 leave
 I
 mean
 we


just
 saw
 Revolute
 which
 is
 one
 of
 the


the
 most
 successful
 companies
 emerge


from
 the
 UK
 in
 recent
 times
 it's


probably
 going
 to
 be
 worth
 a hundred


billion
 the
 founder
 left


>> I
 think
 it's
 Dubai
 or
 somewhere
 it's


gone
 to


>> and
 people
 say
 well
 Britain
 can't


compete
 with
 a
 zero
 tax
 environment
 we


don't
 need
 to
 compete
 with
 a
 zero
 tax


environment
 people
 want
 to
 live
 in


Britain
 still
 you
 just
 have
 to
 stop


clobbering
 over
 them
 over
 the
 head
 and


calling
 them
 evil.


>> Right.


>> Yeah.


>> Now,
 look,
 you
 know,
 I
 can
 give
 you
 a


sob
 story
 as
 well.
 Like
 when
 I
 was
 at


university,
 I
 had
 no
 I
 had
 to
 stop


university
 cuz
 I
 couldn't
 pay
 for
 it.
 I


slept
 on
 the
 street
 in
 a
 park.
 Blah
 blah


blah
 blah
 blah.
 Empathy
 for
 days
 for


people
 who
 are
 in
 that
 position.
 And


there
 are
 lots
 of
 people,
 by
 the
 way,


and
 this
 is
 important
 to
 say,
 Stephen,


who
 are
 not
 in
 your
 position.
 They're


not
 super
 talented.
 They're
 not


predisposed
 to
 success.
 They're
 not
 as


hardworking
 and
 motivated
 as
 you
 for


whatever
 reason.
 And
 many
 people
 are


disabled.
 Many
 people
 have
 all
 sorts
 of


other
 issues.
 And
 of
 course,
 we've
 got


to
 help
 them.
 But
 what
 we
 have
 done
 is


trapped
 now
 hundreds
 of
 thousands,
 if


not
 millions
 of
 people
 who
 could
 be


working
 and
 have
 meaning
 and
 purpose
 in


their
 life
 on
 welfare
 and
 we're
 not


helping
 them
 get
 off
 it
 because
 it's


much
 easier
 to
 give
 them
 a
 payout
 and


forget
 about
 them.
 That's
 what's


happening.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 I've
 had


these
 views
 since
 before
 I
 was
 in
 any


way
 successful.
 I
 just
 looked
 at
 what


works.
 And
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 rich


people
 leaving,
 the
 thing
 is
 I
 don't


care
 about
 rich
 people
 leaving.
 People


who
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 leaving
 is
 not


really
 an
 issue
 for
 me.
 What's
 an
 issue


for
 me
 is
 people
 who
 are
 going
 to
 create


wealth
 leaving.
 So
 on
 that
 point,
 the


founder
 of
 Revolute
 leaving
 the
 UK,
 Nick


Strinsky,
 I
 think
 his
 name
 is,
 um,


estimates
 say,
 credible
 reports
 say
 that


because
 he's
 leaving,
 there's
 going
 to


be
 a3
 billion
 pound
 potential
 loss
 of


capital
 gains
 tax
 that
 he
 would
 have


paid
 had
 he
 not
 absconded
 to
 the
 UAE.


Now
 to
 put
 this
 into
 more
 stark
 terms


what
 that
 means.
 I
 then
 um
 did
 some


research
 and
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 how
 many


people
 it
 would
 take
 to
 pay
 that
 3


billion.
 How
 many
 average
 taxpayers
 it


would
 take
 to
 pay
 that
 3
 billion
 that
 we


that
 we
 lose
 by
 him
 leaving.


>> And
 it
 says
 roughly
 £450,000


average
 UK
 taxpayers
 because
 the
 average


UK
 taxpayer
 pays
 about
 £7,000
 to
 £7,500


a
 year.
 So
 very
 simple
 math
 3
 billion


divided
 by
 7,000
 equals
 430,000
 people.


Mhm.


>> So
 in
 plain
 English,
 that
 billionaire's


potential
 tax
 bill
 is
 equal
 to
 the


entire
 income
 tax
 of
 a
 midsized
 UK
 city


for
 one
 year
 because
 that
 person
 decided


to
 leave.


>> Congratulations,
 you
 tax
 the
 rich.


Congratulations.
 Now
 half
 a
 million


people
 have
 to
 pay
 more
 tax.


Well
 done.


That's
 what
 we're
 doing.
 And
 because


it's
 become
 a
 moral
 argument
 because
 the


rich
 are
 evil


in
 our
 mentality,


people
 don't
 hear
 this
 point
 at
 all.
 It


just
 totally
 goes
 over
 their
 head.
 They


go,
 you
 know,
 but
 but
 the
 rich
 are
 evil,


they
 must
 pay
 more
 tax.
 And
 you
 go,
 even


if
 I
 agreed
 with
 you,
 it
 still
 doesn't


work
 in
 practice.


So
 if
 something
 is
 not
 working
 in


practice,
 why
 would
 you
 keep
 doing
 it?


I
 think
 as
 well,
 you
 know,
 one
 of
 your


other
 points
 was
 around
 what
 the
 UK
 has


to
 offer
 them.
 And
 I
 think
 if
 the
 UK
 was


really
 growth
 focused
 and
 you
 know,
 the


energy
 point
 you
 made,
 energy
 was


cheaper
 here,
 then


>> that
 equation
 that
 these
 founders
 are


making
 whether
 to
 stay
 or
 to
 leave
 would


tilt
 a
 little
 bit
 further
 in
 our


direction.
 So,
 it's
 super
 it's
 so


difficult.


>> And
 no,
 no
 disrespect
 to
 Dubai,
 but
 most


people
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 to
 live
 in


Dubai.


I
 think
 the
 UK
 is
 a
 lovely
 honestly
 I


mean


>> that's
 what
 I
 mean
 right
 and
 I
 say
 this


with
 there's
 lots
 of
 great
 appealing


things
 about
 Dubai
 but
 if
 you
 dealt
 with


prime
 in
 the
 UK
 and
 you
 had
 a
 growth


focused
 mindset
 you
 had
 a
 tax
 climate


that
 encouraged
 people
 to
 start


businesses
 and
 employ
 people
 we
 wouldn't


be
 losing
 these
 people
 and
 we
 shouldn't


be
 losing
 these
 people
 they
 are
 they
 are


the
 people
 who
 will
 create
 the
 wealth
 of


the
 future
 and
 they
 should
 be
 doing
 it


here
 they
 should
 be
 founding
 and
 keeping


their
 businesses
 here
 and
 if
 you
 did


that
 then
 you
 start
 to
 turn
 the
 whole


thing
 we've
 been
 talking
 about
 around


because
 ultimately
 everything
 is
 about


economics
 in
 in
 this
 sense
 the
 military


is
 about
 economics.


It's
 about
 do
 you
 have
 the
 resources
 to


have
 a
 strong
 military?
 We
 don't.
 So
 we


don't.


>> So
 which
 leader
 do
 we
 need?


>> Again,
 I
 don't
 like
 getting
 into
 the


personality
 side
 of
 things.
 But
 what
 you


need
 is
 someone
 who
 understands
 how
 the


economy
 works.


>> Why
 don't
 you
 like
 getting
 into
 the


personality
 side
 of
 things?


>> Because
 what
 happens
 when
 if
 I
 give
 you


a
 name?


>> Yeah.


>> Then
 immediately
 people
 say,
 "Oh,
 he's


one
 of
 them."


>> Okay.


>> Right.
 I
 am
 not
 one
 of
 them
 of
 any
 them.


I'm
 just
 telling
 you
 what
 the
 policies


are
 that
 I
 think
 would
 work
 for
 our


country.
 If
 Kia
 Starama
 tomorrow
 came
 on


your
 show
 and
 said,
 "Stephen,
 I'm
 here


to
 announce
 a
 great
 British


transformation.
 We're
 going
 to
 cut


business
 taxes.
 We're
 going
 to
 get
 rid


of
 net
 zero.
 We're
 going
 to
 make
 sure


that
 we
 have
 the
 cheapest
 energy
 in
 the


world
 for
 our
 businesses
 to
 grow
 and


thrive.
 We're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 strong,


capable
 military.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 I've


just
 hired
 50,000
 new
 police
 officers
 to


deal
 with
 all
 the
 ridiculous
 amounts
 of


street
 crime
 we've
 got
 in
 London.
 Sign


me
 up.
 I'm
 all
 K
 star
 ride
 or
 die,


right?
 But
 that's
 probably
 not
 going
 to


happen.
 That's
 probably
 not
 going
 to


happen
 with
 any
 of
 the
 other
 leaders


that
 we
 have.
 So,
 I'm
 here
 telling
 you


what
 I
 think
 the
 right
 policies
 are.
 And


if
 there's
 a
 leader
 who
 advocates
 for


those
 policies,
 that's
 the
 sort
 of


leader
 that
 I
 will
 support.


>> Only
 18%
 of
 Britons
 view
 Karma


positively.


>> Yeah.


>> With
 around
 65
 to
 72%
 holding
 an


unfavorable
 opinion.


>> You're
 desperate
 for
 me
 to
 slag
 off


Karma.
 I'm
 happy
 to
 do
 it.


>> No,
 no.
 I'm
 I'm
 actually
 not.
 I'm


actually
 not.
 Do
 you
 know what?
 Do
 you


know
 what
 my
 opinion?
 Kiss
 Dharma?


Probably
 a
 really
 nice
 person.


>> Probably


>> probably
 a
 really
 nice
 person.


>> Yeah.
 I
 don't
 really
 care
 how
 nice
 he


is.
 And
 that's
 my
 attitude
 to
 all


politicians.
 I
 care
 about
 whether


they're
 going
 to
 do
 things
 that
 are
 good


for
 our
 country.
 Uh
 from
 what
 I
 know,


he's
 probably
 he
 strikes
 me
 as
 a
 very
 uh


well-intentioned,
 probably
 fairly


competent
 person.


>> Uh
 but
 what
 he's
 doing
 is
 completely


wrong.
 The
 only
 reason
 I
 don't
 like
 to


go
 in
 on
 him
 is
 I
 think
 he
 I
 I
 think


he's
 useless.
 I
 do.
 I
 also
 don't
 think


it's
 fair
 to
 lay
 the
 blame
 for


everything
 that's
 happening
 at
 his
 feet.


The
 Conservatives
 were
 useless
 before


that.
 The
 Lib
 Dems
 and
 the
 Conservatives


were
 useless
 before
 that.
 The
 Labour


Party
 under
 Blair
 were
 actually
 not


useless.
 They
 were
 really
 really
 good
 at


ter
 doing
 terrible
 things
 to
 the


country.
 They
 were
 very
 competent
 at


doing
 that.
 So
 what
 we
 have
 had
 for
 now


one,
 two,
 three
 decades
 is
 terrible


leadership
 that's
 taken
 us
 in
 completely


the
 wrong
 direction.


>> I
 I'm
 I'm
 I
 have
 to
 cite
 the
 statistics


around
 his
 favorability
 or
 popularity


because
 it
 puts
 everything
 you're
 saying


in
 context,
 which
 is
 these
 ideas
 aren't


popular.


>> No.
 Polling
 has
 shown
 that
 Stalmer's


approval
 among
 the
 British
 public
 is
 the


weakest
 of
 any
 recent
 UK
 prime
 minister


with
 dissatisfaction
 levels
 on
 some


trackers
 showing
 him
 to
 be
 below
 most


predecessors
 um
 in
 even
 in
 the
 Labor


government.
 So
 that's
 the
 the
 weird
 part


because
 it's
 not
 it's
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 be


working
 to
 drive
 favorability
 either.


>> No,
 but
 but
 this
 is
 why
 I'm
 saying


focusing
 on
 him
 individually
 isn't


helpful
 actually.
 And
 this
 is
 not
 to


argue
 with
 you
 unnecessarily.
 If
 you
 put


Chem
 Bono
 in
 his
 place,
 she'd
 have
 the


same
 favorability
 ratings.


>> Really?
 Even
 though
 she
 has
 different


ideas.


>> Does
 she?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 You
 tell
 me.


>> She
 has
 some
 different
 ideas.
 I
 mean,


the
 Conservative
 Party's
 gone
 a
 long
 way


to
 changing
 their
 policy
 on
 things
 like


net
 zero,
 right?
 But
 while
 they
 were
 in


power,
 they
 were
 doing
 all
 the
 same


stuff.
 They
 were
 arresting
 people
 for


tweets.
 They
 were
 driving
 the
 economy


into
 the
 ground
 with
 this
 green
 lunacy.


They
 were
 the
 ones
 that
 oversaw
 the


decline
 of
 our
 military.
 So
 uh
 in
 in
 in


some
 ways
 the
 personality
 conversation


is
 really
 not
 that
 important
 here.


What's
 important
 is
 a
 gigantic
 paradigm


shift
 needs
 to
 happen
 to
 our
 attitude
 to


everything.
 And
 one
 of
 them
 is
 dealing


with
 unaffordable
 welfare.
 The
 tries


didn't
 do
 that.
 Labor
 aren't
 doing
 it.
 I


actually
 thought
 Labor
 had
 a
 better
 shot


because
 at
 least
 people
 wouldn't
 say


labor
 are
 evil
 and
 they
 hate
 poor


people.
 That's
 what
 they
 say
 when
 the


Tories
 tried
 to
 cut
 welfare.
 When
 Labor


tried
 to
 cut
 welfare,
 I
 didn't
 think


that
 would
 happen,
 but
 they
 just
 caved


to
 their
 own
 backbench.
 Maybe
 they
 had


to
 for
 political
 reasons.
 But
 you
 you


you
 just
 have
 to
 the
 the
 shift
 that


needs
 to
 happen
 in
 Britain
 is
 not


political.
 It's
 cultural.
 We
 have
 to


change
 the
 mindset
 that
 we
 have
 as
 a


country
 around
 these
 things.


>> Cultural
 transitions
 are
 very
 very very


hard.
 And
 I
 say
 that
 from
 the


perspective
 as
 a
 business
 owner.
 If
 you


tried
 to
 get
 me
 to
 change
 when
 I
 had
 a


lot
 of
 people,
 so
 say
 you
 I
 remember
 in


my
 German
 office
 back
 in
 the
 day
 in


social
 change
 German
 office,
 we
 had
 150


people.
 Very
 very
 different
 culture
 to


the
 UK.
 I
 thought
 naively
 as
 a
 23
 24


year old
 I
 could
 fly
 there


>> and
 change
 the
 culture
 of
 the
 Berlin


office.


>> How
 dumb
 was
 I?


>> This
 is
 not
 how
 we
 do
 things.


>> I
 could
 not
 change
 I
 could
 not
 change


the
 culture
 of
 the
 German
 the
 Berlin


office.
 So
 I
 think
 about
 a
 country


changing
 the
 culture
 of
 a
 country.


>> Yeah.
 That's
 why
 I'm
 what
 I
 call
 an


accelerationist.


>> What
 does
 that
 mean?
 It
 means
 that
 I


believe
 that
 the
 only
 thing
 the
 only
 way


that
 these
 things
 will
 truly


fundamentally
 get
 better
 is
 when
 they


get
 really
 really
 bad
 first.


>> So
 you
 think
 it's
 going to
 get
 really


really


>> the
 only
 way
 to
 change
 the
 culture
 is


for
 people
 to
 understand
 what's
 actually


happening
 uh
 so
 that
 they
 can't
 pretend


the
 things
 that
 are
 happening
 are
 not


happening.
 And
 that's
 what's
 happening


at
 the
 moment.
 Most
 people
 don't
 yet


quite
 know
 that
 they're
 poorer
 today


than
 they
 were
 20
 years
 ago.
 Most
 people


still
 think
 that
 we
 are
 saving
 the


planet
 when
 we
 reduce
 Britain's
 carbon


emissions
 from
 2%
 to
 1.9%
 of
 global


carbon
 emissions.
 While
 in
 fact,
 we're


not
 even
 doing
 that.
 We're
 taking
 our


carbon
 emissions
 and
 we're
 sending
 them


to
 India
 and
 China
 and
 then
 shipping


back
 the
 stuff
 they
 make
 for
 us
 in
 a


dirtier
 way
 on
 big
 tankers
 which


actually
 consume
 more
 dirty
 fuel
 and


we're
 actually
 ending
 up
 increasing
 our


CO2
 output,
 not
 reducing
 it.
 Most
 people


don't
 know
 that.
 But
 when
 they
 feel
 it


in
 their
 pocket,
 when
 they
 feel
 like
 the


we're
 having
 a
 fiscal
 crisis,
 when
 they


feel
 like
 they
 really
 can't
 afford
 their


life
 anymore,
 that's
 when
 they're
 going


to
 start
 to
 ask
 some
 of
 these
 questions.


It's
 one
 of the
 reasons
 actually
 the


narrative
 on
 net
 zero
 is
 shifting.
 Like


almost
 nobody
 other
 than
 the
 government


in
 this
 country
 still
 believes
 in
 the


idea
 of
 net
 zero,
 right?
 Because
 it's


moving
 quite
 quickly
 in
 that
 direction.


Uh
 and
 on
 lots
 of
 other
 things,
 it
 will


happen
 when
 things
 get
 much
 more


difficult
 for
 ordinary
 people.
 Sadly,
 I


don't
 want
 that
 to
 happen,
 but
 I
 think


it's
 the
 only
 way
 things
 get
 better.


>> But
 on
 the
 subject
 of
 global
 warming,


it's
 scientific
 fact
 that
 the
 climate
 is


changing.


>> Changing
 unfavorably.


>> Uh
 what
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 unfavorably?


>> Well,
 if
 the
 you
 know,
 scientists
 talk


about
 the
 poles
 melting
 and
 how
 that


will
 have
 big
 impact
 on
 you
 know
 third


world
 nations
 and


>> um
 how
 that
 will
 be
 a
 net
 negative
 for


the
 planet
 because
 then
 you'll
 see
 more


migration,
 you'll
 see
 more
 sort
 of


natural
 disasters
 and
 those
 kinds
 of


things.
 Well,
 let's
 let's
 not
 argue


about
 that
 because
 neither
 of
 us
 is
 a


climate
 scientist,
 but
 let's
 accept
 that


for
 the
 sake
 of
 argument.


>> How
 is
 outsourcing
 our
 carbon
 emissions


to
 other
 countries


>> while
 destroying
 our
 economy?


>> That's
 I
 mean


>> making
 that
 better.


>> It's
 not.


>> It's
 not
 right.


>> And
 that's
 all
 I'm
 saying.
 All
 I'm


saying
 is
 we
 are
 pretending
 to
 be
 saving


the
 planet
 when
 we
 are
 not
 saving
 the


planet
 while
 also
 destroying
 our
 economy


while
 also
 making
 sure
 that
 pensioners


in
 this
 country
 die
 every
 winter
 cuz


they
 can't
 afford
 to
 pay
 the
 heating


bills
 that
 they
 need
 to
 pay
 to
 stay
 warm


in
 in
 what
 is
 a
 first
 world
 country.


That's
 what's
 happening
 and
 it's


happening
 because
 of
 government
 policy.


So
 we
 are
 not
 saving
 the
 planet
 by


killing
 pensioners.
 I
 I'm
 not
 in
 favor


of
 killing
 pensioners.


>> Have
 you
 ever
 thought
 about
 going
 into


politics?
 Are
 you
 eligible
 for


>> eligible?
 Yes.
 Have
 I
 ever
 thought
 about


it?
 No.
 I
 I
 people
 offer
 me
 to
 go
 into


politics
 regularly,
 but
 it
 it's
 just


it's
 not
 my
 game.


>> Why?
 You
 know,
 you
 when
 you
 talked
 about


your
 mission,
 Yeah.
 it
 seems
 very


aligned
 with


>> going
 into
 politics.


>> I
 feel
 I
 have
 way
 more
 influence
 doing


what
 I
 do
 now


>> than
 being,
 I
 don't know,
 prime


minister.
 Well,
 that's
 extremely


unlikely
 than
 being
 the
 the
 MP
 for
 the


whatever
 on
 C
 who
 who
 gets
 one
 chance
 to


ask
 a
 question
 of
 prime
 minister.
 No,


no,
 no,
 no,
 no.
 I
 get
 to
 speak
 to
 way


more
 people
 and
 to
 persuade
 more
 people


and
 to
 articulate
 ideas
 in
 a
 much
 more


unfiltered
 sense.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


really
 important
 in
 the
 modern
 climate.


What
 happens
 when
 you
 become
 a


politician
 is
 you
 start
 having
 to
 talk


the
 party
 line
 and
 then
 you
 suddenly


don't
 quite
 follow
 what
 you
 actually


believe.
 Now
 you
 have
 to
 adjust
 and
 you


have
 to
 say,
 well,
 you
 know,
 the
 party


believes
 this.
 Well,
 I'm
 not
 interested


in
 speaking
 for
 the
 party.
 I'm


interested
 for
 describing
 things
 in


reality
 as
 I
 see
 them.
 And
 then
 if
 there


are
 politicians
 who
 want
 to
 take
 that


on,
 that's
 their
 job,
 not
 mine.
 I
 just


don't
 have
 the
 temperament
 for
 it


either.
 I
 just
 I'm
 much
 more
 interested


about
 in
 the
 truth
 than
 I
 am
 in
 getting


along
 with
 people,
 coalition
 building,


caring
 about
 potholes,
 you
 know,
 all
 of


this
 other
 stuff.
 In
 this
 multipolar


world,
 this
 is
 how
 we
 got
 to
 the


subject.
 I
 asked
 you
 who
 would
 benefit


and
 is
 it
 a
 good
 thing?
 Yeah.
 And
 then
 I


asked
 you
 is
 is
 it
 a
 good
 thing
 for


Europe?
 And
 you
 said
 no.
 Yeah.


>> Who
 is
 it
 a
 good
 thing
 for?


>> China


>> because
 they
 get
 to
 do


>> do
 what
 they
 want,
 whatever
 that
 is.


They're
 much
 less
 restrained
 by
 the
 US.


It's
 good
 for
 India
 for
 same
 reasons.
 Uh


is
 it
 good
 for
 Russia?
 We'll
 find
 out.


>> Possibly.


>> Good
 for
 America.


>> Yes
 and
 no.
 Oh,
 I
 think
 it's
 that
 that


is
 more
 complicated.
 I
 think
 America


will
 be
 able
 to
 get
 what
 it
 wants
 in


that
 world,
 but
 it's
 probably
 going
 to


find
 itself
 in
 a
 lot
 more
 confrontations


internationally,
 and
 that
 will
 obviously


be
 a
 drain
 on
 its
 resources
 and
 and
 its


energy.


>> If
 you've
 ever
 worked
 in
 a
 startup,
 you


already
 know
 it's
 chaos.
 It's
 speed,
 and


it
 is
 survival.
 And
 now
 with
 AI


accelerating
 everything,
 that
 speed
 has


only
 increased.
 Startups
 are
 landing


enterprise
 deals
 even
 earlier
 than


before.
 But
 what
 comes
 with
 those
 deals


is
 regulatory
 requirements.
 something
 a


lot
 of
 earlystage
 businesses
 aren't


equipped
 to
 handle.
 And
 a
 sock
 too,
 if


you
 know
 what
 that
 means,
 isn't
 always


enough.
 When
 having
 the
 right
 kind
 of


security
 is
 the
 difference
 between


making
 a
 deal
 or
 breaking
 a
 deal,
 you


need
 to
 have
 a
 plan
 in
 place.

 10,000
 of

 a

 Welcome

 This
 is


a

 new

 that
 I'm


launching
 to
 the

 We
 have
 so
 many


incredible
 things
 that
 happen
 that
 you


are
 never
 shown.
 We
 have
 the
 briefs
 that


are
 on
 my
 iPad
 when
 I'm
 recording
 the


conversation.
 We
 have
 clips
 we've
 never


released.
 We
 have
 behind
 the
 scenes


conversations
 with
 the
 guest
 and
 also


the
 episodes
 that
 we've
 never
 ever


released
 and
 so
 much
 more.
 In
 the


circle,
 you'll
 have
 direct
 access
 to
 me.


You
 can
 tell
 us
 what
 you
 want
 this
 show


to
 be,
 who
 you
 want
 us
 to
 interview,
 and


the
 types
 of
 conversations
 you
 would


love
 us
 to
 have.
 But
 remember,
 for
 now,


we're
 only
 inviting
 the
 first
 10,000


people
 that
 join
 before
 it
 closes.
 So,


if
 you
 want
 to
 join
 our
 private
 closed


community,
 head
 to
 the
 link
 in
 the


description
 below
 or
 go
 to


daccircle.com.


I
 will
 speak
 to
 you
 there.


>> Have
 we
 ever
 been
 in
 a
 multipolar
 world


through
 history?


>> Well,
 yeah,
 loads
 of
 times.


>> What
 happened
 next?
 Look,
 a
 friend
 of


mine,
 very
 good
 friend
 of
 mine
 gave
 me


uh
 the
 the
 history
 of
 the
 English-sp


speakaking
 peoples
 by
 Winston
 Churchill


and
 it
 talks
 about
 the
 history
 of
 this


country
 of
 England
 in
 particular
 and


basically
 you
 go
 from
 strong
 ruler
 and


then
 he
 has
 no
 no
 heir.
 You
 have
 a


period
 of
 weakness
 and
 what
 happens


there's
 a
 big
 power
 struggle
 over
 the


throne
 over
 over
 power.
 This
 is
 this
 is


what's
 going
 to
 happen.
 you
 are
 going
 to


see
 more
 instability,
 more
 violence,


more
 attempts
 to
 fight
 for
 dominance
 in


the
 world.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 much
 more


unstable
 period
 of
 time.
 Unfortunately,


it's
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 I've
 been
 so


passionate
 about
 trying
 to
 say
 let's
 not


let's
 not
 allow
 this
 to
 happen.


>> Instability.


>> Yeah.
 in
 terms
 of
 war,
 in
 terms
 of


>> in
 terms
 of
 war,
 in
 terms
 of
 conflict,


in
 terms
 of
 people
 to
 trying
 to
 redraw


maps,
 in
 terms
 of
 people
 trying
 to
 get


access
 to
 resources
 that
 otherwise
 would


have
 been
 considered
 unchallengeable,


etc.
 Yeah,


>> I
 was
 looking
 back
 through
 history
 and
 I


was
 asking
 the
 question,
 has
 there
 been


a
 multipolar
 world
 before?
 And
 there's


these
 moments
 through
 history,
 fifth


century
 BC
 with
 ancient
 Greece,
 um
 19th


centur
 19th
 century
 Europe
 between
 the


1850s
 and
 1914s,
 the
 wearing
 states
 of


China
 in
 475
 BC.
 And
 then
 my
 next


question
 was
 what
 happens
 next?


>> And
 the
 short
 answer
 is
 more
 friction,


less
 restraint,
 higher
 risk.


Realistically,
 the
 first
 thing
 that


happens
 is
 rules
 weaken,
 which
 I
 guess


is
 kind
 of
 what
 we're
 seeing
 at
 the


moment


>> with
 this
 whole
 idea
 of
 international


law.


>> Regional
 wars
 begin,
 not
 one
 big
 war.


Arms
 races
 accelerate.
 Some
 alliances


harden,
 economic
 fragmentation,
 domestic


pressure
 rises,
 so
 higher
 defense


spending,
 higher
 taxes,
 etc.,
 um,
 lower


growth.


And
 the
 three
 end
 games
 history
 keeps


showing
 that
 we
 have
 managed
 chaos,


major
 war,
 a
 reset,
 and
 then
 a
 new
 hedge


hegeimon
 emerges.


>> Yes.


>> What
 the
 does
 that
 mean?


>> Hegeimon
 is
 the
 one
 dominant
 power
 that


that
 that
 sort
 of
 in
 the
 same
 way
 that


the
 US
 had
 that
 moment
 between
 91
 and


recently
 when
 it
 was
 the
 only
 undisputed


power
 in
 the
 world.


>> Do
 you
 agree
 with
 that
 pattern
 of


events?
 Well,
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 you


sort
 of
 make
 it
 look
 like
 I've
 got
 all


my
 ideas
 from
 AI,
 but
 yeah.
 Yeah.
 But


but
 but
 the
 see
 this
 is
 the
 thing
 is


like
 before
 we
 started
 I
 said
 to
 you,


Stephen,
 do
 me
 one
 favor.
 Don't
 present


me
 as
 an
 expert
 cuz
 I'm
 just
 a
 guy


thinking
 from
 first
 principles
 and


explaining
 the
 basics
 as
 I
 understand


them.
 All
 of
 this
 is
 common
 sense


because
 ultimately
 it
 comes
 back
 to


human
 nature,
 right?
 We
 are
 a
 tribal


competitive
 species.
 That's
 what
 we
 are.


So
 when
 there
 isn't
 a
 dominant
 force


that
 everyone
 respects
 and
 accepts
 as


the
 leader,
 what
 happens
 every
 single


time
 when
 you
 have
 a
 power
 vacuum,
 you


have
 a
 power
 struggle.
 That's
 what
 we


are
 seeing
 and
 that's
 what
 you're
 going


to
 see.
 It's
 human
 nature.
 It's
 not


about
 knowing
 geopolitics
 and
 having


studied
 international
 theory
 for
 40


years.
 It's
 just
 basic
 human
 nature.


When
 there
 when
 there
 is
 a
 dispute
 about


who
 the
 leader
 is,
 that
 always
 creates


the
 thing
 that
 AI
 just
 told
 you.


>> Well,
 the
 next
 step
 in
 that
 is
 a
 power


struggle.


>> Yeah.
 But
 that's
 what
 you're
 seeing
 now.


>> But
 in
 there's
 never
 been
 a
 nuclear,


>> right?
 And
 nuclear
 weapons
 have
 been
 the


great
 force
 for
 peace.
 We
 had
 the
 the


great
 historian
 from
 the
 rest
 is


history,
 Dominic
 Samrach,
 on
 the
 show


and
 I
 asked
 him
 about
 this
 and
 he
 said,


"Yeah,
 I
 mean
 nuclear
 weapons
 is
 why
 we


haven't
 had
 a
 major
 war
 and
 it's
 maybe


the
 one
 thing
 that
 will
 constrain
 our


ability
 to
 have
 a
 major
 war."
 It's
 one


possibility.


It's
 also
 the
 great
 risk.


>> Maybe
 this
 is
 where
 the
 cycle
 ends


because
 of
 nuclear
 weapons
 is
 what


you're
 saying.
 Maybe
 this
 is


>> um
 yeah,
 I'm
 I'm
 I
 am
 hopeful
 on
 that


front
 actually.
 I
 I
 am
 hopeful
 that


human
 beings
 ultimately
 the
 instinct
 for


self-preservation
 is
 so
 strong
 that
 we


do
 not
 go
 there.
 I
 think
 that's
 that's


by
 far
 and
 away
 the
 most
 likely


scenario.
 But
 of
 course,
 it
 is
 something


that
 humans
 have
 to
 reckon
 with
 and
 we


have
 to
 be
 very
 very
 careful
 as
 things


more
 and
 by
 the
 way
 nuclear
 weapons


may
 not
 be
 the
 most
 powerful
 weapons


that
 exist
 in
 the
 world
 20
 years
 from


now.


in
 such
 a
 world
 and
 I
 know
 you
 don't


like
 it
 being
 about
 individuals
 but


Trump
 is
 a
 certain
 type
 of
 leader


>> you
 know
 quite
 unapologetic
 in
 what
 he


says


>> I
 think
 he's
 got
 even
 more
 unapologetic


because
 he
 only
 has
 a
 couple
 of
 years


left
 and
 he
 can't
 be
 reelected
 because


of
 the
 laws
 are
 you
 concerned
 that
 if
 a


different
 type
 of
 leader


arrived
 into
 power
 in
 the
 US
 maybe


someone
 who
 China
 and
 Russia
 thought
 was


less
 likely
 to


send
 the
 the
 the
 jets
 in
 at
 nighttime


and
 bomb
 nuclear
 bunkers
 or
 snatch
 a


president
 from
 their
 house.


>> Would
 that
 be
 a
 risk
 for
 the
 West
 in


your
 view?


>> Massive.


>> So
 do
 you
 think


>> but
 that's
 how
 we
 got
 here.
 This
 is
 why


that
 withdrawal
 from
 Afghanistan


embarrassing
 as
 it
 was
 is
 exactly
 how


you
 get
 everything
 else.
 It's
 just
 one


symptom
 of
 people
 thinking
 we
 talked


about
 October
 7th,
 we
 talked
 about
 the


invasion
 of
 Ukraine,
 right?
 That's
 what


happens
 when
 they
 see
 weakness.
 This
 is


what
 happens.
 I
 remember,
 you
 know,
 um


it's
 kind
 of
 funny.
 It
 shows
 the


cultural
 differences
 between
 the
 Russian


mindset
 and
 the
 Western
 mindset
 because


the
 Jungle
 Book
 that
 we
 had
 in
 the


Soviet
 Union
 is
 very
 different
 to
 the


one
 that
 you
 see
 that
 you
 guys
 had
 here.


Did
 you
 see
 Jungle,
 you
 know,
 the


original
 Jungle
 Book?


>> The
 Disney
 one?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 You
 know,
 it's


all
 have
 the,
 you
 know,
 uh


>> context
 you
 should
 probably
 say
 where


you
 come
 from
 because


>> I'm
 from
 from
 the
 Soviet
 Union.
 I
 was


born
 there.
 Um
 and


>> your
 your
 father,
 you've
 got
 mother
 and


father
 that
 Ukrainian
 and
 Russian.


>> Yeah.
 Basically.
 Yeah.
 Um,
 so
 the
 Soviet


Jungle
 Book
 adaptation,
 very
 different.


And
 there's
 this
 the
 one
 of
 the
 opening


scenes
 is
 Akella,
 who
 is
 the
 lead
 wolf.


He's
 the
 the
 wolf,
 the
 leader
 of
 the


wolf
 pack.
 They're
 on
 a
 hunt
 and
 he


they're
 hunting
 and
 he
 misses
 the
 he's


supposed
 to
 grab
 the
 animal
 and
 he


misses.
 And
 suddenly
 the
 cry
 goes
 around


the
 jungle.
 I
 ke


knows
 what
 that
 means.


Everybody
 knows
 when
 the
 leader
 shows


weakness
 and
 fails,
 that's
 the
 moment


when
 everything
 goes
 to
 and
 there's


a
 power
 struggle
 for
 his
 role
 because


he's
 no
 longer
 top
 dog.


It's
 really
 as
 simple
 as
 that.


>> So,
 do
 you
 think
 Trump's
 a
 good
 thing


for
 the
 West?


>> Trump
 is
 a
 good
 thing
 for
 America.


>> I
 think
 what
 he's
 done
 by
 virtue
 of
 his


behavior
 is
 he's
 exposed
 the
 weakness
 of


Europe.
 And
 there
 is
 a
 cleave
 now


happening
 between
 Europe
 and
 America.


And
 to
 that
 extent,
 I
 think
 it
 could
 be


a
 good
 thing
 for
 Europe
 if
 Europe
 gets


its
 act
 together
 and
 says,
 "Actually,


we've
 got
 to
 wake
 up
 from
 the
 nightmare


that
 we've
 created
 for
 ourselves
 and


start
 acting
 differently."
 If
 that


happens,
 it
 will
 also
 be
 a
 good
 thing


for
 the
 West.
 That
 is
 not
 what's


happening
 right
 now.
 It's
 going
 in
 the


exact
 opposite
 direction.


>> What
 would
 it
 take
 for
 you
 to
 leave
 the


UK?


Um


you
 well
 look
 I
 like
 you
 know
 everybody


gets
 job
 opportunities
 and
 stuff
 goes


for
 a
 year
 or
 two
 somewhere
 that
 that


that
 could
 happen
 in
 any
 circumstance.


If
 you
 mean
 like
 for
 me
 to
 say
 I'm


leaving
 Britain
 never
 coming
 back.
 Um
 I


think
 it
 would
 have
 to
 be
 clear
 at
 the


next
 election
 that
 Britain
 is
 actually


going
 further
 down
 the
 path
 that
 we're


on.
 So
 two
 or
 three
 years
 from
 now,
 I'd


have
 to
 conclude
 that
 there's
 actually


no
 there's
 no
 way
 we're
 coming
 back.


It's
 over.
 And
 that's
 happened
 to
 great


countries
 and
 great
 civilizations
 in


history.
 If
 that's
 what
 happens,
 then
 I


I
 don't
 see
 why
 I
 should
 do
 my
 children


to
 living
 here.
 If
 we
 can
 rescue
 it,
 uh,


and


make
 this
 sounding
 like
 Trump,
 make


Britain
 great
 again,
 but
 you
 know what
 I


mean.
 Um,
 then
 I
 I
 I
 would
 love
 to
 fight


for
 that
 and
 I'd
 love
 to
 to
 have
 my


children
 be
 part
 of
 that.


What
 is
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 that
 we


didn't
 talk
 about
 that
 we
 should
 have


talked
 about?


>> This
 point
 I
 keep
 coming
 back
 to,


Stephen,
 which
 is
 we
 can't
 live
 in
 a


world
 in
 which
 we
 care
 more
 about
 how


things
 make
 us
 feel
 than
 about
 the


consequences
 of
 the
 actions
 that
 we
 take


so
 much.
 This
 is
 a
 Thomas
 Sol.
 Last
 time


you
 had
 me
 on,
 I
 mentioned
 to
 you
 what
 a


great
 writer
 and
 thinker
 Thomas
 Soul
 is.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 you've
 had
 a
 chance
 to


check
 out
 any
 of
 his
 work,
 but
 I


recommend
 it
 thoroughly
 to
 everyone


watching
 and
 listening.
 He
 he
 talks


about
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 last
 several


decades
 have
 been
 spent
 replacing
 what


works
 with
 what
 feels
 good.
 That's
 the


one
 thing
 we're
 not
 talking
 about.
 All


the
 policies
 you
 and
 I
 have
 been
 talking


about
 are
 all
 about
 what
 makes
 us
 feel


good
 as
 opposed
 to
 what
 actually
 works


in
 practice.
 And
 our
 conversation
 about


chasing
 out
 entrepreneurs,
 it's
 exactly


about
 that.
 It's
 exactly
 what
 it's


about.
 It's
 about
 fulfilling
 your


ideological
 emotional
 needs
 as
 opposed


to
 doing
 things
 that
 practically
 work.


If
 we
 can
 make
 that
 adjustment
 and
 get


back
 to
 reality,
 the
 world's
 our
 oyster.


>> An
 immigrants
 love
 letter
 to
 the
 West,


the
 book
 that
 you
 wrote.
 It
 was
 a
 smash


here,
 Sunday
 Times
 bestseller.


>> Yeah.
 Unfortunately,
 it
 gets
 more


accurate
 every
 day,
 which
 is
 really


worrying
 because
 I
 was
 very
 pessimistic


about
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 things
 I
 said.


>> That
 is
 absolutely
 right.
 You
 wrote


this,
 was
 it
 2022?


>> 2022,
 it
 came
 out.


>> 2022.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 it
 appears
 to
 be
 a
 prediction
 as
 the


days
 go
 on.
 A
 prediction
 that
 is
 being


validated,
 unfortunately.
 I
 highly


recommend
 everybody
 reads
 this
 book.
 I'm


going to
 link
 it
 below
 for
 anyone
 that


hasn't
 read
 it.
 What's
 unique
 about
 you


is
 you
 do
 appear
 to
 be
 very
 wedded
 to


objective
 truth
 as
 you
 see
 it
 versus


being
 ideologically
 cap
 captured
 by


either
 side.
 And
 I've
 seen
 you
 I've
 seen


you
 both
 attack
 the
 right
 at
 times
 and


I've
 also
 seen
 you
 attack
 the
 left
 at


times
 which
 is
 it's
 a
 unique
 position
 to


be
 in
 in
 a
 world
 with
 algorithms
 that


try
 and
 push
 you
 into
 a
 particular
 echo


chamber.


I
 guess
 on
 that
 point
 what
 is
 it
 about


the
 the
 right
 that
 you
 take
 most
 issue


with
 at
 the
 moment?


>> Oh
 there's
 a
 thing
 that
 I've
 uh
 other


people
 have
 at
 a
 similar
 time.
 So,
 I'm


not
 claiming
 authorship
 of
 it,
 but


there's
 something
 that
 I
 call
 the
 woke


right,
 uh,
 which
 is
 essentially
 an


identitarian
 resentment
 victimhood-based


movement
 on
 the
 right,
 represented
 by


the
 sort
 of
 extreme
 characters
 like
 Nick


Fuentes
 and
 Candace
 Owens
 in
 the
 United


States.
 You
 know,
 their
 worldview
 is


that
 they
 they've
 been
 oppressed.
 You


know,
 the
 work
 narrative
 was
 we
 are


oppressed.
 Well,
 now
 they
 say
 we
 we've


been
 oppressed
 and
 uh
 it's
 all
 the
 fault


of
 various
 groups,
 the
 Jews,
 the


whoevers.
 So,
 it's
 a
 kind
 of
 um
 there's


almost,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 it's
 fair
 to


say
 that
 there
 are
 elements
 of
 it
 that


are
 just
 openly
 fascistic
 and
 and and


reminiscent
 of
 the
 Nazis
 that
 we
 saw
 in


the
 1930s
 ideologically
 speaking.
 Um,


and
 the
 mainstream
 right
 has
 utterly


rejected
 these
 people,
 which
 I
 think
 is


really
 reassuring.
 But
 there
 are
 some


people
 who
 who
 say
 well
 actually
 no
 no


we
 need
 to
 include
 them
 and
 we
 shouldn't


divide
 the
 conservative
 movement
 which
 I


think
 is
 a
 huge
 mistake
 from
 for


conservatives
 to
 make
 because
 their


movement
 and
 their
 reputation
 with


normal
 people
 will
 be
 very
 very
 badly


polluted
 in
 the
 eyes
 of
 independents
 and


moderate
 people
 who
 actually
 represent


the
 overwhelming
 majority
 of
 the
 public.


Even
 in
 America,
 which
 is
 so
 divided
 and


so
 partisan,
 the
 normal
 average
 person


will
 vote
 for
 this
 party
 or
 for
 that


party
 depending
 on
 what
 they
 see.
 And
 in


Britain,
 that's
 even
 more
 the
 case.
 And


so
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 the
 right,
 so


they're
 basically
 there's
 a
 risk
 of
 the


right
 repeating
 the
 mistakes
 of
 the


left.
 What
 happened
 on
 the
 left?
 Woke


people
 came
 along
 and
 they
 said,
 "We're


the
 left.
 Our
 crazy
 work
 ideas
 is


actually
 the
 left."
 and
 the
 sensible


people
 on
 the
 left
 were
 terrified
 of


challenging
 them.
 And
 so
 over
 time,
 most


people
 began
 to
 associate
 the
 left
 with


blue-haired,
 nose
 piercing,
 you
 know,


Greta
 Tunberg
 kind
 of
 ideology.
 And
 they


went,
 I
 don't
 want
 any
 of
 that.
 Well,
 on


the
 right,
 if
 the
 right
 allows
 its


extremist
 fringe
 to
 do
 the
 same
 thing,


then
 lots
 of
 people
 are
 going
 to


distance
 themselves
 from
 that.
 So,
 I


think
 the
 right
 has
 a
 tremendous


opportunity
 to,
 you
 know,
 we've
 had
 this


great
 tension.
 And
 I
 know
 you've
 had


Jordan
 Peterson
 on
 your
 show
 and
 I'm


sure
 he
 talked
 about
 chaos
 and
 order
 and


that
 relationship
 is
 a
 very
 fragile


thing
 in
 society.
 We
 have
 had
 so
 much


chaos
 that
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 craving
 for


order
 now.
 There's
 a
 craving
 to
 deal


with
 crime.
 There's
 a
 craving
 to
 deal


with
 illegal
 immigration.
 There's
 a


craving
 to
 deal
 with
 cultural
 uh


disruption
 that
 we've
 had,
 right?


There's
 a
 craving
 for
 that
 sense
 of


order
 to
 come
 back.
 And
 if
 the
 right
 is


reasonable
 and
 sensible
 about
 addressing


those
 issues,
 they
 could
 be
 in
 charge


for
 a
 very
 long
 time
 and
 have
 an


opportunity
 to
 put
 some
 of
 their
 views


into
 public
 policy,
 which
 is
 they


haven't
 had
 uh
 the
 opportunity
 to
 do
 for


a
 long
 time.
 If
 they
 allow
 the


extremists
 to
 take
 over,
 they
 will
 be


painted,
 the
 entire
 movement
 will
 be


painted
 as
 the
 extremists
 and
 then
 they


will
 not
 have
 the
 opportunity
 to


actually
 implement
 their
 agenda.


>> Are
 you
 happy?


>> Very.


>> What
 makes
 you
 happy?


>> My
 family.


What
 about
 your
 family
 makes
 you
 happy?


>> Having
 children
 is
 a
 blessing.
 It's
 the


best
 thing
 ever.
 I
 you
 know
 I
 banged
 on


about
 this
 to
 you
 last
 time,
 but
 it
 is


>> why


>> why
 are
 children
 the
 best
 thing
 ever?


>> Yeah.


>> Can't
 explain
 it.
 It's
 not
 one
 of
 the


like
 I
 can
 find
 some
 words
 to
 give
 you,


but
 it's
 just
 one
 of
 those
 things.
 It's


like
 you
 you
 don't
 know
 it
 until
 you


have
 that
 experience.
 Uh
 I
 could
 give


you
 some
 nice
 sound
 bites.
 You
 know,
 one


of the
 things
 I've
 said
 in
 the
 past
 is


that
 the
 future
 is
 no
 longer
 an


abstraction.


>> What
 does
 that
 mean?


>> It
 means
 that


in
 the
 past
 I
 cared
 about
 this
 country


or
 this
 civilization
 from
 a
 fairly


theoretical
 perspective.


Now
 the
 future
 of
 this
 country
 is
 one


person
 and
 maybe
 other
 people
 coming


along,
 right?
 Little
 people
 that
 I
 have.


They
 are
 the
 future
 in
 my
 mind,
 right?


So
 I'm
 much
 more
 attached.
 I'm
 much
 more


attached
 to
 the
 people
 who
 came
 before


me.
 I
 have
 much
 more
 understanding
 of
 my


when
 you
 have
 kids,
 you
 have
 a
 much


better
 understanding
 of
 your
 parents
 cuz


you
 go,
 "Oh,
 wow."
 So,
 the
 reason
 they


did
 this
 stupid
 thing
 is
 a
 I'm
 also


doing
 it
 now
 for
 some
 reason.
 And
 also,


they
 were
 really
 dealing
 with
 all
 of
 all


the
 things
 that
 I'm
 now
 deal
 I've
 got
 a


job
 and
 I've
 got
 a
 relationship
 and
 I've


got
 a
 this
 and
 I've
 got
 a
 that.
 So,
 of


course,
 they
 sometimes
 behaved
 in
 ways


that
 I
 didn't
 understand
 or
 like
 or


whatever.
 So,
 you
 have
 more
 empathy
 for


your
 parents.
 You
 also
 have
 much
 much


more
 concern
 about
 where
 your
 country
 is


going,
 your
 nation's
 going,
 your


community
 is
 going,
 your
 immediate


environment
 cuz
 that's
 where
 your


children
 live.
 And
 then
 there
 just
 joy.


I
 mean,
 it's
 um
 there's
 nothing
 like
 it.


There's
 really
 really
 nothing
 like
 it.


It's
 the
 most
 wonderful
 thing.
 It's


 hard.


>> It
 you
 don't
 sleep
 a
 lot
 and
 it's


stressful
 at
 times,
 but
 it's
 the
 best.


It's
 absolutely
 the
 best.


>> And
 you've
 got
 two
 kids.


>> I've
 got
 one.
 Uh
 but
 maybe
 more
 on
 the


way.


>> Oh,
 okay.
 Congratulations.
 Thank
 you.


>> And
 what
 what
 is
 your
 primary
 concern


for
 the
 world
 they're
 coming
 into?


>> Well,
 we've
 talked
 about
 all
 of
 this,


right?
 I


>> there
 was
 a
 primary


>> I
 think
 my
 primary
 concern
 for
 my
 kids


is
 that
 my
 wife
 and
 I
 do
 the
 best
 job
 we


can
 in
 raising
 them
 well.
 And
 then


ultimately
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 their
 own


people
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 deal


with
 the
 world
 in
 front
 of
 them
 in


exactly
 the
 same
 way
 that
 others
 before


have
 done.
 My
 grandfather
 uh
 my


great-grandfather


he
 was
 younger
 than
 me
 now
 when
 he
 was


sent
 to
 the
 Eastern
 Front
 while
 he
 had
 a


baby
 son
 at
 home
 and
 he
 never
 came
 back.


Human
 beings
 have
 had
 to
 deal
 with
 all


of
 this
 throughout
 history.
 We
 always


have
 to
 deal
 with
 the
 reality
 of
 the


terrible
 world
 that
 we
 face
 at
 that


moment
 in
 time.
 They're
 going
 to
 have
 to


do
 the
 same.
 I
 can't
 protect
 them
 from


that.
 What
 I
 can
 do
 is
 set
 them
 up
 in


the
 best
 possible
 way.
 And
 that's
 the


only
 thing I
 can
 do
 as
 a
 parent.
 That's


what
 I'm
 trying
 to
 do.
 We
 have
 a
 closing


tradition
 where
 Damascus
 leaves
 a


question
 for
 the
 next.


>> Yeah.


>> The
 question
 that's
 been
 left
 for
 you
 is


who
 was
 the
 biggest
 non-family
 member


influence
 in
 your
 life
 and
 how
 did
 they


make
 you
 a
 better
 person?


>> Yeah.
 Not
 fair
 to
 boil
 it
 down
 to
 one.
 I


think
 um
 I
 I
 had
 a
 teacher
 once
 who
 um


basically
 made
 me
 realize
 that
 it's
 very


very
 important
 to
 give
 people
 an


opportunity
 to
 prove
 themselves
 and
 he


did
 that
 by
 giving
 me
 an
 opportunity


when
 I
 really
 didn't
 deserve
 it
 but
 he


gave
 it
 to
 me
 and
 I
 took
 it.
 I've
 also


just
 intellectually
 Thomas
 Saul
 I
 I
 I


mentioned
 him
 reading
 his
 books
 is
 just


completely
 transformational
 for
 me
 and


it
 really
 helped
 me
 think
 about
 the


world.
 I
 think
 on
 a
 on
 a
 on
 a
 kind
 of


personal
 behavioral
 level
 I
 got
 a
 a
 huge


opportunity
 uh
 to
 to
 tour
 with
 Jordan


Peterson
 for
 three
 weeks
 a
 couple
 of


years
 back.
 Uh,
 and
 that
 was
 completely


transformational
 seeing
 him
 up
 close,


spending
 time
 with
 him,
 seeing
 that
 this


is
 a
 man
 who
 the
 way
 he
 is
 in
 public
 is


exactly
 the
 way
 that
 he
 is
 in
 in


private.
 And
 so
 he
 really
 one
 of
 those


very
 very
 rare
 people
 who
 preaches
 what


he
 practices.
 I
 remember
 we
 uh
 I
 think


it
 was
 El
 Paso.
 We
 arrived
 right
 on
 the


south
 on
 the
 on
 the
 on
 the
 border
 and
 we


arrived
 we
 were
 late
 from
 the
 airport


starving
 starving.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 tends
 to
 happen
 is
 everyone
 who


goes
 to
 his
 live
 shows
 works
 out
 that
 he


might
 be
 at
 the
 best
 steak
 restaurant
 in


town


>> on
 the
 day.
 So
 we
 turn
 up
 to
 the
 steak


restaurant
 cuz
 he
 only
 eats
 steak.
 We're


starving.
 We
 sit
 down.
 Um
 the
 the
 waiter


brings
 the
 menus.
 We're
 the
 moment
 we


start
 looking
 at
 the
 menus.
 This
 group


of
 guys
 comes
 over
 guy
 guys
 and
 girls


comes
 over.
 He
 stands
 up,
 forgets
 about


the
 menu.
 We're
 starving.
 gives
 them,


you
 know,
 all
 the
 attention
 in
 the


world.
 Selfies,
 has
 a
 little
 chat,
 ask


them
 what
 they
 do,
 blah
 blah
 blah
 blah


blah,
 sits
 down,
 places
 the
 order.


Another
 group
 of
 people
 come
 over,
 gives


them
 the
 same
 amount
 of
 attention.
 And


by
 this
 point,
 we're
 dying
 of
 hunger.


Finally,
 our
 steaks
 arrive,
 and
 you
 know


they
 do
 in
 America,
 they
 say,
 "Please


check
 that
 it's
 been
 cooked
 properly."


So,
 he
 cuts
 in,
 he
 cuts
 off
 a
 piece,
 he


puts
 it
 on
 a
 fork,
 and
 as
 he's
 about
 to


place
 it
 in
 his
 mouth,
 a
 group
 of


literally
 20
 people
 shows
 up
 saying,


"Dr.
 Peterson,
 I'm
 so
 sorry.
 He
 puts
 the


fork
 down,
 stands
 up,
 and
 gives
 them
 all


the
 exact
 same
 amount
 of
 attention
 that


he'd
 given
 the
 previous
 people.
 And
 just


in
 everyone
 that
 he
 interacted
 with,


that's
 what
 I
 saw.
 A
 guy
 who
 talks
 about


living
 in
 a
 certain
 way,
 actually


practices
 it.
 And
 that
 was,
 you
 know,


incredibly
 inspiring
 for
 me.
 Really


educational,
 gave
 me
 a
 lot
 of
 thoughts


about
 my
 relationships,
 how
 I
 live
 my


life.
 Um,
 he's
 he's
 a
 great
 man.


>> Constantine.
 Thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you
 very
 much.
 Thanks
 for
 having


me.


>> Staying
 in
 the
 pursuit
 of
 truth
 and
 I


highly
 recommend
 people
 check
 out


trigonometry
 your
 podcast.
 I'm
 going
 to


link
 it
 below.
 Um
 and
 also
 the
 book
 is


going
 to
 be
 linked
 below.
 Is
 there


anything
 else?


>> Yes,
 Stephen.
 When
 are
 you
 coming
 on


trigonometry?
 That's
 the
 question.


>> I've
 just
 finished
 my
 book.


>> Oh,


>> it
 comes
 out
 in


>> UK
 exclusive
 is
 what
 I'm
 hearing.


>> Deal.
 Deal.


>> Signed.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.
 I
 really
 appreciate


it.


>> Thanks,
 man.
 I
 appreciate
 you
 having
 me.


I
 believe
 that
 we
 are
 already
 at
 the


early
 stages
 if
 not
 in
 World
 War
 II.


>> We
 are
 one
 misunderstanding,
 one


miscalculation
 away,


>> or
 even
 one
 AI
 generated
 viral
 video


>> from
 nuclear
 annihilation.
 So,
 here's
 a


terrifying
 detail
 that
 the
 public
 does


not
 know.
 So,


>> wow.
