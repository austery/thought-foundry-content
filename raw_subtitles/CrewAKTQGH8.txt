We are seeing this very consistent improvement over many, many years where every say like, you know, three, four months is able to like do a task that is twice as long as before, completely on its own. We can extrapolate this. We see that in a year from now, maybe two years from now, the top models are going to be able to work completely on their own for like a whole day or more. And the reason I think why task lengths, specifically is interesting is because that's what allows you to delegate more and more work to language models to agents. Even if you have a very clever model, but if it needs feedback or the interaction with you very often, then it really limits what you can delegate to it. If you need to talk to it every 10 minutes, right? Versus if you have something that can go for hours at a time, you can have a whole team that you delegate tasks to and manage them. The agents are smart enough to work on their own, to correct their own errors, to iterate.
