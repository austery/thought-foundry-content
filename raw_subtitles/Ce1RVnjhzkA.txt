From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Michael


Bubaro.
 This
 is
 the
 daily.


With
 a
 single
 monumental
 action
 expected


today,
 the
 Trump
 administration
 will


eliminate
 its
 own
 legal
 authority
 to


fight
 climate
 change.


My
 colleague,
 Lisa
 Freriedman,
 has
 spent


the
 past
 few
 weeks
 piecing
 together
 the


inside
 story
 of
 how
 a
 small
 group
 of


activists
 turned
 that
 once
 improbable


goal
 into
 reality.


It's
 Thursday,
 February
 12th.


Lisa,
 welcome
 back
 to
 the
 Daily.


>> Thank
 you.
 Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> So,
 over
 the
 summer,
 Lisa,
 you
 broke
 the


story
 that
 the
 Trump
 administration
 was


planning
 to
 roll
 back
 the
 legal
 basis


for
 the
 entire
 government's
 ability
 to


regulate
 greenhouse
 gases.
 Just
 remind


us
 what
 that
 legal
 basis
 was
 and
 why
 its


elimination
 would
 be
 so
 consequential.


>> Sure.


It's
 called
 the
 endangerment
 finding
 and


you
 can
 think
 of
 it
 like
 the
 spine
 of


America's
 ability
 to
 regulate
 climate


pollutants.
 Congress
 never
 explicitly


told
 the
 EPA
 that
 it
 could
 regulate


planet
 warming
 emissions.
 But
 in
 2007,


the
 Supreme
 Court
 ruled
 in
 a
 landmark


ruling,
 it's
 called
 Massachusetts
 versus


EPA,
 that
 greenhouse
 gases
 qualify
 as


pollutants
 under
 the
 law.
 And
 because


EPA
 is
 required
 to
 set
 limits,
 required


to
 regulate
 damaging
 pollutants,


the
 court
 told
 the
 agency,
 you
 need
 to


determine
 whether
 these
 greenhouse


gases,
 carbon
 dioxide,
 methane,
 others,


whether
 they
 endanger
 health
 and


welfare.


>> Mhm.
 Two
 years
 later,
 the
 EPA,
 citing
 a


massive
 body
 of
 scientific
 evidence,


came
 out
 with
 what
 is
 now
 called
 the


endangerment
 finding
 that
 six
 greenhouse


gases
 do
 pose
 a
 danger
 to
 public
 health


and
 the
 environment


>> and
 therefore
 should
 be
 regulated


>> and
 therefore
 should
 be
 regulated.
 So
 if


you
 think
 of
 the
 endangerment
 finding
 as


the
 spine,
 that
 is
 what
 has
 allowed
 for


regulations
 on
 carbon
 emissions
 from


automobiles,
 from
 power
 plant
 smoke


stacks,
 methane
 from
 oil
 and
 gas
 well


leaks.
 And
 if
 you
 repeal
 the


endangerment
 finding,
 as
 the
 Trump


administration
 is
 about
 to
 do,
 then


there
 is
 no
 basis,
 there's
 no
 legal


basis
 or
 scientific
 basis
 for
 regulating


greenhouse
 gas
 emissions
 in
 the
 United


States.
 the
 government
 essentially
 gives


up
 its
 authority.
 And
 not
 to
 mix


metaphors,
 but
 when
 the
 endangerment


finding
 goes
 away,
 all
 of
 these


regulations
 that
 stem
 from
 it
 fall
 like


a
 house
 of
 cards.


>> Right.
 And
 during
 our
 first
 conversation


when
 you
 first
 explained
 all
 this
 to
 our


listeners,
 Lisa,
 you
 had
 told
 me
 that


the
 efforts
 to
 eliminate
 the


endangerment
 finding
 and
 to


fundamentally
 defang
 the
 legal
 framework


behind
 how
 we
 regulate
 greenhouse
 gases.


All
 of
 that
 had
 unfolded
 behind
 closed


doors.
 It
 was
 very
 hard
 to
 understand


how
 it
 had
 happened
 and
 who
 was
 involved


in
 it.
 But
 now
 all
 these
 months
 later,


you
 have
 reporting
 on
 what
 exactly
 that


behindthe-scenes
 effort
 looked
 like
 and


notably
 who
 was
 doing
 this


behind-the-scenes
 work.
 So
 tell
 us
 about


what
 you
 found.


So,
 it
 was
 pretty
 stunning
 to
 see
 how


quickly
 and
 comprehensively
 the
 Trump


administration
 moved
 to
 reverse
 the


endangerment
 finding.
 As
 soon
 as


President
 Trump
 got
 into
 office,
 it
 was


one
 of
 the
 early
 moves
 in
 in
 January


2025
 to
 tell
 the
 EPA
 to
 make
 a
 ruling
 on


whether
 to
 reconsider
 this
 finding.
 And


what
 our
 reporting
 showed
 was
 this


wasn't
 just
 an
 accident.
 This
 wasn't


just
 years
 of
 persistence
 coming
 to


fruition.
 That
 happens
 sometimes
 in


Washington.
 This
 was
 made
 possible
 by
 a


very
 small
 group
 of
 highly
 trained


conservative
 lawyers
 who
 had
 spent
 years


working
 in
 secret
 to
 prepare
 for
 the


moment
 when
 a
 Republican
 president
 could


obliterate
 the
 government's
 ability
 to


regulate
 climate
 change.


>> So
 who
 are
 these
 people?
 These


conservative
 lawyers
 you're
 talking


about?


>> It
 really
 starts
 with
 two
 people.
 Mandy


Gunnness
 and
 Jonathan
 Breitbill.
 The


Green
 New
 Deal
 is
 not
 a
 serious


proposal.
 It
 reads
 like
 Karl
 Marx's


Christmas
 list
 and
 is
 a
 Soviet
 style


central
 planning
 document
 calling
 for
 a


government
 takeover
 of
 the
 agricultural,


transportation,
 housing,
 and
 healthcare


sectors.
 Gunca
 has
 a
 very
 long
 history


fighting
 climate
 policies,
 not
 climate


change,
 climate
 policies.
 She
 used
 to


work
 for
 Senator
 Jim
 Inhof,
 who
 wrote
 a


book
 called
 The
 Greatest
 Hoax,
 the


global
 warming
 conspiracy.
 In
 case
 we


have
 forgotten
 because
 we
 keep
 hearing


that
 2014
 has
 been
 the
 warmest
 year
 on


record,
 I
 asked
 the
 chair,
 you
 know
 what


this
 is?
 It's
 a
 snowball.


>> And
 he
 one
 day
 threw
 a
 snowball
 on
 the


Senate
 floor
 in
 February
 to
 prove
 that


climate
 change
 was
 not
 a
 thing.


>> And
 that's
 just
 from
 outside
 here.
 So


it's
 very,
 very
 cold
 out,
 very


unseasonal.
 So
 here,
 Mr.
 President,


catch
 this.
 Mhm.


>> Guncura
 is
 the
 the
 aid
 who
 handed
 him


that
 snowball.
 And
 that's
 one
 of
 the


things
 she's
 pretty
 well
 known
 for
 in
 in


Washington.


>> Huh.


>> She
 enters
 the
 first
 Trump


administration
 where
 she
 is
 instrumental


in
 pushing
 for
 the
 United
 States
 to


withdraw
 from
 the
 Paris
 Agreement,
 which


President
 Trump
 eventually
 did.


>> Mhm.
 During
 the
 Biden
 administration,


she
 argued
 strenuously
 against
 policies


that
 he
 put
 in
 place
 to
 reduce
 emissions


from
 automobiles
 and
 power
 plants
 and


the
 rest.


>> From
 day
 one,
 he's
 held
 true
 to
 that


promise
 to
 quote,
 "shut
 down
 fossil


fuel,
 and
 he
 and
 the
 Democrats
 have


taken
 over
 100
 actions
 aimed
 at
 making


it
 harder
 for
 oil
 and
 gas
 to
 be


developed
 and
 delivered
 to
 market."


essentially
 making
 the
 argument
 that


policies
 to
 address
 climate
 change
 are


more
 harmful
 than
 climate
 change
 itself.


>> It's
 not
 climate
 change
 that
 farmers
 nor


Americans
 should
 be
 worried
 about.
 It's


the
 policies
 being
 pushed
 in
 the
 name
 of


climate
 change
 that
 stand
 to
 do
 far
 much


more
 damage.


>> Her
 partner
 in
 trying
 to
 repeal
 the


endangerment
 finding
 was
 an
 attorney


named
 Jonathan
 Breitbel.
 before
 the


Supreme
 Court
 will
 be
 the
 question
 of


what
 limits
 exist
 in
 Clean
 Air
 Act


section
 111D1.


>> He
 had
 served
 in
 the
 Justice
 Department


under
 the
 first
 Trump
 administration.


Everyone
 we
 have
 talked
 to
 has
 described


him
 as
 a
 very
 sharp
 legal
 mind
 who


really
 knows
 his
 way
 around
 the
 Clean


Air
 Act,
 Clean
 Water
 Act.


>> The
 Hinge
 issue
 can
 really
 succinctly
 be


stated
 as
 follows.
 Does
 EPA
 have
 the


authority
 to
 determine
 the
 emissions


rate
 based
 on
 what's
 achievable
 by
 what


EPA
 thinks
 is
 the
 best
 system
 of


emissions
 reduction?
 Period.


>> And
 has
 made
 the
 argument
 in
 court
 that


Democratic
 administrations
 have
 really


overreached
 in
 their
 efforts
 to
 impose


regulations
 to
 address
 climate
 change.


He
 was
 essentially
 dealing
 with
 the


downstream
 effects
 of
 the
 endangerment


finding


>> and
 it
 makes
 your
 head
 swim
 to
 try
 and


parse
 through
 the
 various
 clauses
 and


instructions
 that
 are
 contained
 there.


>> Because
 of
 the
 endangerment
 finding,
 EPA


has
 been
 dealing
 with
 a
 whiplash
 of


regulations.
 They
 have
 been
 created
 in


Democratic
 administrations,
 erased
 in


Republican
 administrations,


and
 fought
 in
 courts
 the
 entire
 time.


>> Mhm.
 Withdrawing
 the
 endangerment


finding
 eliminates
 this
 situation


entirely
 and
 that's
 what
 Gounka
 and


Breitbel
 plotted
 to
 do.


>> And
 how
 do
 they
 actually
 go
 about
 doing


that?


>> So
 in
 the
 summer
 of
 2022,
 Gounka
 and


Breitbill
 start
 seeking
 funding
 for
 a


big
 new
 project.


They
 want
 to
 create
 a
 secret
 operation


to
 kill
 the
 endangerment
 finding.


They
 pitched
 conservative
 organizations.


They
 asked
 for
 about
 $2
 million
 for
 the


ability
 to
 work
 on
 scientific
 studies


and
 research
 from
 scientists
 who


disagree
 with
 the
 mainstream
 science.


They
 would
 start
 laying
 out
 the
 legal


case
 for
 repealing
 the
 endangerment


finding.
 All
 of
 these
 things
 were
 things


that
 could
 be
 used
 by
 a
 next
 Republican


president.
 They
 hoped
 Donald
 Trump
 on


day
 one.
 They
 did
 eventually
 receive


funding
 from
 a
 conservative


organization,
 the
 Heritage
 Foundation.


The
 Heritage
 Foundation
 would
 go
 on
 to


lead
 Project
 2025,
 the
 blueprint
 for
 the


next
 Republican
 president.
 And
 Mandy


Gunnness
 wrote
 the
 EPA
 chapter
 for


Project
 2025.


So
 these
 two
 lawyers,
 Gunessa
 and


Breitbill,
 they
 are
 ensuring
 that
 this


cause
 of
 rolling
 back
 environmental


regulations
 of
 going
 after
 the


endangerment
 finding
 that
 it
 gets
 taken


up
 by
 a
 major
 conservative
 think
 tank
 in


Heritage
 with
 a
 ton
 of
 influence
 in


Republican
 politics.


>> Exactly.
 Right.
 Then
 in
 tandem,
 we
 have


two
 other
 lawyers,
 much
 more


high-profile
 figures,
 who
 are
 working
 in


their
 own
 right
 to
 bring
 down
 the


endeavor
 finding.


>> And
 who
 is
 that?


>> Russ
 Vote
 and
 Jeff
 Clark.


>> Much
 better
 known,


>> much
 better
 known
 figures.
 Russell
 Vote,


as
 we
 know,
 during
 the
 Biden
 years,


starts
 the
 starts
 a
 think
 tank
 of
 his


own,
 the
 Center
 for
 Renewing
 America,


where
 they
 were
 keeping
 the
 MAGA


movement
 alive.


>> Mhm.
 Jeff
 Clark
 has
 been
 in
 the
 fight


against
 the
 endangerment
 finding
 for


decades.


>> EPA,
 it
 seems
 to
 me,
 is
 too
 big.
 It's


bloated
 on
 stimulus
 money
 and
 uh
 it


seems
 uh
 hellbent
 on
 expansion


>> before
 there
 ever
 was
 an
 endangerment


finding.
 He
 went
 to
 court
 to
 argue
 that


the
 EPA


>> doesn't
 have
 and
 shouldn't
 have
 the


legal
 authority
 to
 address
 greenhouse


gases.
 It
 doesn't
 matter
 to
 EPA
 if
 it's


absurd.
 If
 its
 regulations
 are
 going
 to


lead
 to
 absurd
 consequences
 that
 inflict


massive
 harm
 on
 the
 national
 economy,


>> he
 loses
 that
 and
 that
 from
 from


everything
 we
 have
 been
 told
 is
 really
 a


motivating
 factor
 for
 years
 with
 Jeff


Clark.
 What
 he
 sees
 as
 writing
 a
 wrong.


Of
 course,
 the
 other
 thing
 Jeff
 Clark
 is


known
 for,
 and
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 our


listeners
 will
 remember
 this,
 is
 that
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 first
 Trump
 term,
 he


emerges
 from
 deep
 within
 the
 Justice


Department
 as
 an
 ally
 of
 President
 Trump


and
 trying
 to
 overturn
 the
 2020


election.
 So
 much
 so
 that
 Trump
 briefly


considers
 making
 him
 the
 acting
 attorney


general.
 And
 that
 so
 scares
 people
 at


the
 Department
 of
 Justice
 that
 many
 of


them
 threaten
 to
 quit
 if
 it
 happens.


President
 backs
 down.
 But
 Clark
 becomes


known
 as
 a
 major
 election
 denier.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 so
 by
 late
 2022,
 2023,


Jeff
 Clark
 and
 Russ
 Vote
 are
 enscconced


in
 a
 rowhouse
 in
 Capitol
 Hill
 that
 vote


had
 complained
 was
 infested
 with
 pigeons


and
 drafting
 executive
 orders
 for
 a
 new


president
 to
 use
 to
 eliminate
 climate


protections.
 And
 then
 at
 the
 same
 time,


Gunness
 and
 Breitbill
 are
 collecting


what
 they
 have
 called
 an
 arsenal
 of


information
 to
 support
 the
 repeal
 of
 the


endangerment
 finding.


Sure
 enough,
 President
 Trump
 wins
 the


presidency.
 Three
 out
 of
 four
 of
 the


people
 that
 we're
 talking
 about
 here,


Breitbill,
 Clark,
 and
 vote
 go
 back
 into


the
 administration


>> and
 are
 able
 to
 hand
 the
 president
 a


very
 clear
 road
 map
 for
 the
 biggest


climate
 deregulation
 in
 American


history.
 And
 that's
 what's
 being


followed
 right
 now.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


So
 Lisa,
 once
 a
 bunch
 of
 these
 advocates


of
 repealing
 the
 endangerment
 finding


end
 up
 inside
 the
 White
 House
 and
 in
 a


position
 to
 actually
 repeal
 it,
 what's


the
 technical
 case,
 what's
 the
 legal


case
 that
 they
 make
 to
 try
 to
 do
 that?


>> So,
 remember
 I
 told
 you
 that
 the
 Obama


administration
 wrote
 the
 endangerment


finding
 because
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 said


in
 order
 to
 regulate
 these
 gases,
 you


need
 to
 determine
 that
 these
 are
 harmful


to
 human
 health
 and
 the
 environment.


Mhm.


>> So
 now
 this
 administration,
 the
 Trump


administration


is
 looking
 at
 that
 finding
 and
 they're


saying
 the
 science
 that
 you
 used
 is


something
 we
 don't
 agree
 with
 and


they're
 saying
 the
 legal
 rationale
 is


problematic.


>> So
 start
 with
 the
 science.
 Why
 do
 they


dispute
 the
 science
 and
 is
 it


compelling?
 So
 they
 have
 made
 the
 case


that
 the
 predictions
 that
 were
 made


about
 the
 impacts
 of
 climate
 change
 back


in
 2009
 were
 too
 pessimistic.
 Their


evidence
 to
 support
 that
 claim
 is
 a


report
 that
 five
 handpicked


climate
 contrarians
 wrote
 in
 secret
 for


the
 Department
 of
 Energy
 last
 year.
 It


was
 designed
 to


support
 the
 repeal
 of
 the
 endangerment


finding.
 And
 no
 surprise
 to
 anyone,
 the


conclusion
 was
 that
 climate
 change


threats
 have
 been
 overblown.


>> Interesting.


>> And
 what
 multitudes
 of
 scientists
 have


told
 us
 are
 two
 things.
 Yeah,
 the
 planet


is
 better
 off
 than
 what
 was
 predicted
 in


2009
 because
 the
 international
 community


has
 acted
 not
 enough,
 not
 fast
 enough,


but
 has
 done
 work
 towards
 reducing


emissions.
 But
 what's
 also
 true
 is
 that


every
 bit
 of
 emissions
 that
 enters
 the


atmosphere
 leads
 to
 more
 warming,
 which


leads
 to
 more
 health
 impacts,


and
 all
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we
 know


continue
 to
 endanger


human
 health
 and
 the
 environment.


Scientists
 say
 that
 that
 research
 is


even
 more
 ironclad
 today
 than
 it
 was
 in


2009.


>> Then
 there's
 the
 Trump
 administration's


legal
 arguments
 for
 repealing
 the


endangerment
 finding.
 There's
 a
 couple.


Take
 a
 step
 back.
 The
 endangerment


finding
 that
 flowed
 from
 a
 law,
 the
 1970


Clean
 Air
 Act.
 This
 EPA
 is
 arguing
 that


the
 Clean
 Air
 Act
 only
 allows
 EPA
 to


regulate
 what
 it
 calls
 local
 and


regional
 pollutants,
 things
 like
 soot


from
 industrial
 sources,
 factories,


power
 plants,
 stuff
 that's
 really
 bad


when
 you
 breathe
 it
 in.


>> Greenhouse
 gas
 emissions
 don't
 work
 that


way.


carbon
 dioxide,
 methane,
 you
 know,
 all


these
 gases,
 they
 disperse
 into
 the


atmosphere,
 they
 trap
 heat,
 they
 linger


from
 decades
 to
 centuries
 and
 alter
 the


climate.


>> So,
 this
 EPA
 is
 is
 making
 the
 argument


that
 it
 just
 does
 not
 have
 the
 legal


authority
 to
 deal
 with
 those
 kinds
 of,


let's
 call
 them,
 global
 pollutants.


>> Interesting.
 So
 their
 argument
 is
 that


the
 endangerment
 finding
 misunderstands


the
 clean
 air
 act
 and
 thinks
 that
 you


can
 regulate
 greenhouse
 gases
 that
 by


definition
 are
 not
 local.
 They
 end
 up
 in


the
 sky.
 They
 end
 up
 far
 from
 their


original
 source
 and
 therefore
 the


endangerment
 finding
 is
 not
 legally


sound.


>> Exactly.


>> Do
 lawyers
 agree
 with
 that
 argument?


>> They're
 mixed.
 I
 mean,
 there
 are
 some


conservative
 lawyers
 who
 think
 that
 the


EPA
 has
 a
 really
 good
 case
 to
 make.
 You


know,
 environmental
 attorneys
 that
 we've


we've
 spoken
 to
 have
 said
 that
 the


George
 W.
 Bush
 administration
 made


similar
 arguments
 to
 defend
 its
 decision


not
 to
 issue
 an
 endangerment
 finding
 and


lost.
 But
 there's
 another
 argument


that's
 linked.
 Mhm.


>> Since
 2009,
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 has


repeatedly
 ruled
 against
 environmental


regulations
 that
 require
 big


transformational
 changes
 to
 industry
 and


the
 economy.
 And
 so
 the
 Trump


administration
 is
 saying
 based
 on
 that


new
 legal
 landscape
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 so


many
 of
 the
 regulations
 that
 have


stemmed
 from
 the
 endangerment
 finding


require
 in
 their
 view
 sweeping


technology
 economic
 changes.


>> Mhm.


>> They're
 arguing
 that
 the
 source,
 the


endangerment
 finding
 should
 be


overturned.


>> Fascinating.
 If
 so
 many
 regulations
 that


flow
 from
 the
 endangerment
 finding


eventually
 get
 struck
 down
 by
 the


Supreme
 Court,
 then
 the
 fruit
 of
 those


regulations,
 the
 finding
 itself
 should


itself
 be
 seen
 as
 illegal


>> unless
 Congress
 explicitly
 gives
 the
 EPA


authority
 to
 regulate
 greenhouse
 gas


emissions,
 which
 after
 decades
 they
 have


never
 done


>> and
 this
 Congress
 is
 very
 unlikely
 to


ever
 give
 it
 that
 power.


>> Definitely
 not.
 Okay.
 So,
 now
 that
 we


understand
 the
 Trump
 administration's


arguments
 here,
 just
 explain


how
 they're
 going
 to
 turn
 those


arguments
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the


endangerment
 finding.
 What
 do
 we
 expect


the
 administration
 to
 do
 to
 end
 the


finding?
 So,
 what
 we
 expect
 is
 on


Thursday,
 the
 administrator
 of
 the
 EPA,


Lee
 Zelden,
 who
 has
 said
 that
 he
 plans


to
 drive
 a
 dagger
 through
 the
 heart
 of


the
 climate
 change
 religion,
 his
 words,


will
 announce
 the
 end
 of
 the


endangerment
 finding,
 but
 it's
 not
 the


end
 of
 the
 story.


>> Meaning,


>> environmental
 groups,
 states
 are
 going


to
 immediately
 sue
 and
 this
 will
 be


played
 out
 in
 the
 courts
 over
 the
 next


several
 years.
 And
 what
 do
 we
 expect


will
 happen
 in
 the
 courts
 and
 just
 how


high
 up
 in
 the
 courts
 is
 this
 likely
 to


go?


>> Well,
 that's
 the
 thing.
 We
 know
 what
 the


group
 that
 we've
 been
 talking
 about,
 the


the
 folks
 who
 laid
 out
 this
 road
 map


hope
 to
 see,
 and
 that
 is
 that
 this
 case


gets
 before
 the
 Supreme
 Court.
 And
 if


that
 happens,
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 hope
 in


the
 conservative
 movement
 that
 the


landmark
 climate
 change
 case,


Massachusetts
 versus
 EPA,
 could
 be


overturned
 or
 significantly
 weakened.
 So


their
 hope
 is
 that
 the
 endangerment


finding
 ends
 up
 before
 the
 Supreme
 Court


in
 such
 a
 way
 that
 a
 conservative


majority
 of
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 would


overturn
 the
 original
 Supreme
 Court


ruling
 that
 allows
 the
 endangerment


finding
 to
 have
 ever
 come
 into


existence.


>> You
 hit
 the
 nail
 on
 the
 head.
 And
 if


that
 happens,
 a
 future
 president
 would


not
 be
 able
 to
 reinstate
 regulations


addressing
 greenhouse
 gas
 emissions


unless
 and
 until
 Congress
 explicitly


said,
 "Go
 do
 that."


>> And
 let's
 presume
 for
 just
 a
 moment,


Lisa,
 that
 our
 legal
 system
 does
 allow


the
 endangerment
 finding
 to
 go
 away.


I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 repercussions


of
 that
 on
 the
 environment
 on
 industry


and
 let's
 just
 start
 with
 the
 impact
 on


industry
 that
 now
 operates
 under
 these


regulations
 that
 I
 presume
 suddenly


would
 start
 to
 go
 away.


>> Well,
 one
 thing
 that
 industry
 would
 get


is
 the
 certainty
 that
 it
 has
 said
 it


always
 wants,
 right?
 it
 would
 know
 that


it
 would
 not
 face
 what
 has
 been
 a
 decade


and
 a
 half
 of
 whiplash.
 Democrats
 come


in
 and
 start
 to
 regulate
 power
 plants


and
 automobiles
 and
 the
 rest
 and
 then
 a


Republican
 administration
 comes
 in
 and


removes
 or
 weakens
 them.


>> Mhm.


>> There
 would
 be
 a
 new
 playing
 field
 and


it
 would
 not
 include
 regulatory


restrictions.
 So
 the
 question
 is
 will


this
 lead
 to
 industries
 polluting
 more,


>> right?


>> And
 yeah,
 we
 we
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,
 it


is
 certainly
 possible
 that
 because


companies
 have
 already
 put
 billions
 of


dollars
 into
 clean
 technology,
 whether


it's
 for
 EVs
 or
 pollution
 controls
 in


power
 plants,
 that
 they
 will
 continue
 to


do
 so.
 There's
 also
 public
 pressure
 and


you
 know,
 companies
 very
 much
 care
 about


how
 they
 are
 seen
 and
 whether
 they
 are


stepping
 up
 to
 a
 challenge
 like
 climate


change.
 But
 the
 reality
 is
 left


completely
 unshackled
 as
 this
 EPA
 is


about
 to
 do,
 we
 don't
 really
 know
 how


industry
 will
 react.


>> Well,
 given
 that
 uncertainty,


what
 would
 the
 elimination
 of
 the


endangerment
 finding


mean
 for
 the
 environment
 and
 for
 climate


change
 at
 large?
 Is
 that
 suddenly
 now


pretty
 much
 in
 the
 hands
 of
 industry?


>> It's
 such
 a
 hard
 question
 to
 answer.
 I


mean,


yes.
 And
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 is
 that


the
 Trump
 administration
 has
 already


pretty
 effectively


restricted
 some
 of
 the
 things
 that


states
 can
 do
 to
 address
 climate
 change


on
 their
 own.


>> Like
 what?


>> California
 is
 the
 only
 state
 in
 the


country
 that
 can
 set
 more
 stringent


environmental
 regulations
 than
 the


federal
 government.
 It
 needs
 a
 waiver
 to


do
 that.
 California
 tried
 to
 set
 even


stricter
 automobile
 emissions
 rules.


They
 had
 a
 plan
 to
 eliminate
 the
 sales


of
 combustion
 engine
 vehicles,
 you
 know,


in
 the
 next
 decade
 or
 so.
 But
 the
 Trump


administration
 and
 Congress
 rescended


that
 waiver.
 I
 can't
 see
 California


getting
 another
 waiver,
 at least
 during


the
 next
 three
 years.


>> Mhm.
 So
 that
 really
 ties
 the
 hands
 of


not
 just
 California
 but
 other


like-minded
 states
 that
 might
 want
 to
 do


something
 very
 ambitious
 on
 automobiles.


>> So
 in
 the
 absence
 of
 major
 new
 state


regulation
 and
 a
 federal
 government
 that


doesn't
 want
 to
 regulate
 most
 of
 these


greenhouse
 emissions
 at
 all.
 What
 do


scientists
 say
 that
 the
 world
 starts
 to


look
 like?


>> Scientists
 are
 worried.
 I
 mean
 the


United
 States
 is
 the
 largest
 historic


emitter
 of
 climate
 change.
 It's
 the


second
 largest
 annual
 emitter
 of
 carbon


pollution
 and
 greenhouse
 gases.
 If
 the


US
 is
 not
 doing
 its
 part,
 a
 lot
 of


countries
 could
 start
 to
 wonder
 why


should
 they?
 And
 the
 most
 important
 is


China.
 And
 that's
 the
 big
 fear
 that
 a


lot
 have
 have
 relayed
 to
 me.
 If
 the


United
 States
 is
 is
 successful
 in
 not


just
 failing
 to
 reduce
 its
 own


emissions,
 but
 convincing
 other


countries
 that
 they
 don't
 need
 to


either,
 scientists
 feel
 that
 could
 have


a
 really
 dangerous
 domino
 effect
 for
 the


planet.


>> And
 where
 do
 those
 dominoes
 eventually


fall?
 I
 mean,
 they
 they
 fall
 in
 more


severe
 rising
 temperatures
 and
 more


droughts
 and
 hotter
 droughts,
 more


frequent
 and
 severe
 wildfires,
 rising


sea
 levels
 from
 melting
 glaciers
 that


are
 threatening
 coastal
 communities.


These
 kinds
 of
 changes
 also
 directly


damage
 human
 health.
 Scientists
 tell
 us


they
 damage
 food
 security,
 water


supplies.
 They
 lead
 to
 an
 increase
 in


vectorbor
 diseases,
 Lyme
 disease,
 deni.


There's
 a
 whole
 sweeping
 landscape
 of


impacts
 that
 scientists
 are
 warning
 will


get
 worse
 if
 emissions
 continue
 to
 go


up.
 I
 feel
 like
 what's
 quite
 remarkable


about
 the
 story
 that
 you've
 told
 here
 is


how
 quickly
 this
 country's
 relationship


to
 greenhouse
 gases,
 the
 idea
 that
 they


create
 climate
 change
 and
 that
 this
 is


something
 to
 be
 addressed
 by
 the


government,
 how
 quickly,
 really
 just
 in


a
 decade
 and
 a
 half
 that's
 changed.
 If


you
 go
 back
 to
 the
 mid
 early
 2000s
 when


the
 endangerment
 finding
 was
 written,
 it


seemed
 like
 much
 of
 the
 business
 and


even
 political
 world


was
 starting
 to
 become
 aligned
 in
 this


sense
 that
 there
 was
 a
 problem
 and
 that


something
 could
 be
 done
 about
 it.


>> Hi,
 I'm
 Nancy
 Pelosi,
 lifelong
 Democrat


and
 speaker
 of
 the
 House.


>> And
 I'm
 N.
 Gingrich,
 lifelong
 Republican


and
 I
 used
 to
 be
 speaker.
 I'm
 sure
 you


remember
 the
 famous


>> ad
 where
 Nancy
 Pelosi
 and
 Nuke
 Gingrich


are
 sitting
 on
 a
 couch
 together
 in
 front


of
 the
 capital.


>> We
 don't
 always
 see
 eye
 to
 eye,
 do
 we,


N?


>> No,
 but
 we
 do
 agree
 our
 country
 must


take
 action
 to
 address
 climate
 change.


>> There
 wasn't
 always
 going
 to
 be
 ever,
 of


course,
 agreement
 about
 what
 to
 do
 about


it.
 businesses
 weren't
 thrilled
 about


some
 of
 the
 costs
 entailed
 in
 changing


their
 conduct,
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 got


on
 board
 with
 the
 idea
 that
 something


needed
 to
 be
 done.
 And
 yet,
 as
 you've


explained
 here,
 a
 very
 persistent
 group


of
 ideologically
 aligned
 climate
 change


skeptics
 kept
 at
 it
 through
 Republican


and
 Democratic
 presidencies
 and
 have


succeeded
 in
 making
 their
 view,
 which


isn't
 necessarily
 the
 nation's
 view,


become
 the
 government's
 official
 policy.


And
 that's
 something
 to
 behold.


>> It
 really
 is.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


became
 clear
 as
 we
 were
 reporting
 this


story
 out
 is
 that
 this
 group
 of


conservative
 lawyers,
 their
 views
 on


climate
 change
 were
 not
 in
 the


mainstream
 even
 of
 their
 own
 party.
 But


they
 were
 persistent
 and
 they
 did
 an


enormous
 amount
 of
 planning
 and
 that


persistence


paid
 off
 in
 the
 form
 of
 President
 Trump


who
 you
 know
 we
 all
 know
 his
 views
 on


climate
 change.
 Calls
 it
 a
 hoax.
 Calls


it
 a
 scam.
 And
 when
 President
 Trump
 was


elected,
 these
 two
 forces
 joined
 and


they
 were
 ready
 to
 get
 this
 anti-climate


agenda
 done.
 And
 later
 today,
 when
 the


endangerment
 finding
 is
 repealed,


it
 will
 be,
 in
 the
 words
 of
 one
 climate


contrarian,
 total
 victory
 for
 their


cause.


Well,
 Lisa,
 thank
 you
 very
 much.


>> Thanks
 so
 much.


>> We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's


what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.
 On


Wednesday,
 the
 mystery
 surrounding
 the


federal
 government's
 decision
 to


abruptly
 shut
 down
 the
 airspace
 around


El
 Paso,
 Texas,
 originally
 for
 10
 days,


appeared
 to
 be
 solved.
 The
 Times
 reports


that
 the
 closure
 was
 announced
 after


officials
 from
 US
 Customs
 and
 Border


Protection
 decided
 to
 try
 out
 a
 new


anti-
 drone
 laser
 technology
 in
 order
 to


shoot
 at
 what
 they
 believed
 was
 a
 drone


from
 Mexican
 drug
 cartels.
 But
 the


Border
 Protection
 officials
 failed
 to


give
 officials
 from
 the
 Federal
 Aviation


Administration
 enough
 time
 to
 assess
 the


risks
 of
 the
 new
 technology
 on


commercial
 planes.

 prompted
 the
 FAA


to
 shut
 down
 the
 airspace
 before

reversing
 their

 decision.


And

 many
 of
 Epstein's
 co-conspirators


have
 you
 indicted?
 How

 it.
 You
 I
 I
 find
 it.


>> How
 many

 I

 to
 answer
 the
 question.
