Have a 70% hit rate.
I've got a long enough career
in enough strategies where it's
statistically significant
and I have a 70% hit rate,
which means I'm right 70% of the time,
which means I'm wrong 30% of the time.
So I've been at this for over 40 years,
so I've been wrong
for more than 12 years, right?
But thank God they haven't been in a row.
Really.
Three years is
when everyone pulls for plug.
If you're if you're wrong,
if you underperform, you're one.
You're two.
When you're three, you're gone.
You know if you're
if you're wrong five years in a row.
They shut your Janus unconstrained
bond fund
because you can't have sequential years
of outperformance.
It's a very specific example, Jeff
Wonder where that came from.
Hello and welcome to another episode
of the Odd Lots podcast.
I'm Tracy Alloway and I'm Joe Weisenthal.
Joe, we are still in celebratory mode.
Yes, ten year ten year anniversary.
It's ten year
anniversary month. Really? Yeah.
And even next month, kind of ten year
anniversary month.
So we can just extend this
for a long time. We could just make this.
Well, we should have made 2025
the Odd lot's ten year anniversary.
Year, year. Yeah.
But we're almost at the end of the year.
That's right. We failed in that respect.
But obviously we're sort of reflecting
on the past decade or so.
on Odd Lots and things
that have or haven't changed in markets.
And one thing
I've been thinking about a lot
is what's been going on in the bond
market. Yeah, you can't.
Well I think look there is nothing
that's more different
in 2025 versus 2015
than what's going on in fixed income.
Right.
So you say that and it is true. Okay.
You know, if you look at if you look
at the benchmark ten year yield okay.
Sure.
We're at 4% now above 4%.
And in 2015 we were at like 2%.
Yeah that's changed.
And we went through inflation,
which is something
we hadn't experienced for a long time
in, you know, previous years.
But I also feel like it's changed
but a lot of it hasn't.
A lot of the discussions haven't changed.
If I think about what we were discussing,
back in 2015, it was stuff like,
who's going to buy US treasuries
or who's going to fund the US
deficit bond vigilantes?
I mean, how many years have
we been talking about bond vigilantes now?
The credit market,
it was whether or not investors
are being adequately compensated
for the risk they're taking on.
And the funny thing is, now,
you know, if you look at spreads on junk
rated bonds, if you didn't think
they were being adequately compensated
at like 7.2% in 2015,
I wonder what you think
when you look at spreads of 6.4% in 2025.
This is a really good point actually,
because especially lately, obviously
we've had all of these, you know,
we've had a number of credit events,
these little blow ups, Jamie Diamond
use the term cockroaches, etc.
but by and large spreads
which were sort of infamously narrow
last decade remain
quite narrow by historical terms.
I feel like we should just mention here
we are recording on November 10th.
Oh yeah, things are changing
fast in the credit market.
There's a little bit of nervousness
creeping in,
but you're you're absolutely right.
By and large, spreads are,
you know, pretty, very pretty low levels.
And people have been complaining about it
for a long time now.
Well, speaking of credit,
you also have the rise of private credit,
which is something we were talking about
even back in 2015.
But back then you were.
Well, no, we both were. But we called it
something different.
We called it, you know, Shadow Banks.
Sure, sure.
And yeah, that, but that is a space
that's much bigger, much more interest,
much more scrutiny.
I mean, just the whole, you know,
orders of magnitude bigger since 2015.
I don't think people have any real handle
on, like,
what risk scenarios look like,
the quality of the underwriting, etc..
So this is, definitely something.
And it's, you know,
we've been talking about it for years,
but it continues to grow.
And with some of these, quote,
cockroaches, etc., more interest
in what's really going on.
Right?
So things have changed,
but things have also kind of stayed
the same in some respects.
But I'm very happy to say we do, in fact
have the perfect guest
to talk about all of this.
Someone who has, you know, been
writing and conversing and going on TV
and talking about a lot of these themes
and making a great career.
Fantastic.
And all of these actually investing
based off some of these ideas.
We're going to be speaking with Jeff
Gundlach.
He is, of course, the founder
and CEO of DoubleLine
Capital, someone we've wanted
to get on the show for a long time.
So Jeff, thank you so much for coming on.
All thoughts.
Well, thanks for having me.
I'm looking forward to our discussion
today.
So let's start big picture
because I actually we can take this
and you know
a bunch of different directions.
But when you look at the Treasury market
and when you look at the credit market,
which are you more concerned
about at the moment?
Because I know you've voiced some worries
about both of these things.
Yeah.
I'm, concerned about the financing
of long term treasuries,
primarily
because we are issuing a lot of them. And,
there's
inflationary policies that are being run
and probably likely to be further
doubled down upon
when Jerome Powell leaves as fed chairman.
I mean, we've got Scott
best interest of Treasury secretary.
Well he's basically, mimicking
what the president says.
He basically says rates should be a point
lower or two points lower.
I've heard different numbers
out of President Trump.
He wants rates at 2%, 3%,
but inflation is running
above 3% on the headline CPI.
And it's not likely to come down
to the Fed's 2% target.
And so there's a lot of interest
in artificially lowering
lowering interest rates and perhaps
taking the maturities of treasuries.
Ever increasingly
to under one year in maturity.
A lot of investors aren't
aware of the fact that something like,
80% of all treasuries
issued in the last 12 months,
and this has been the case for the last
few years, are less than one year.
The treasuries that are issued
longer than 20 years.
So 20 years, up to 30 years is only 1.7%
of the Treasury issuance
in the last 12 months.
And what's interesting about that is
the fed has been cutting interest rates
over the last 13, 13 months.
And historically when the fed cuts
interest rates, of course,
short term interest rates decline
definitionally at the fed funds level,
but also two year Treasury rates decline,
five year Treasury rates decline.
In effect, long term
Treasury rates have always declined,
subsequent to the first cut
by the Federal Reserve,
and particularly when you're in a sequence
of Federal Reserve cuts.
And that's certainly been the case
with now a 150 basis points.
But this time, all interest
rates are outside of the two year
are higher than they were before the Fed's
first rate cut.
That's just never happens historically.
Another interesting thing
that has never happened
historically is earlier this year,
during the tariff tantrum of late
March and early April, stock
market had a pretty significant correction
and it was going back, back
to around 2000.
It was the 13th correction in the S&P 500,
defined by a drop of 10%,
at least 10% in the in the 12 corrections
before the one here in 2025,
the dollar went up when the, stock market
went down as a flight to quality asset
that didn't happen this time.
When we went into that correction earlier
this year, the dollar went down,
usually goes up by around 8%.
And in the first quarter, early
second quarter of this year,
it went down by around 10%.
So what is happening
here seems to be that the pattern
of interest rate movements
and currency movements,
and what's a flight to quality asset
and what isn't seems to have changed
because interest rates have bottomed
at the long end of the yield curve.
And I've been saying this for five years
now, that the secular decline in interest
rates at long, at the long
term, well, maturities is over.
In fact, in the next session, long term
interest rates are likely to go higher,
not lower.
And what's happened
since the fed started cutting corroborates
this somewhat radical idea of mine when
it comes to credit, spreads are tight.
Although you correctly noted that
they're not on the types of the year
anymore, they're starting to widen.
I think junk bond spreads
are up by about 30 or 40 basis points.
And yes, spreads
have remained tight for a long time.
But one thing that you also of referenced
a little bit is the quality
of the public, corporate credit market
is better than it's been historically.
It's way better than it was
prior to the global financial crisis,
where you had all kinds of garbage
lending going on.
But in recent years, the garbage lending
has not gone to the public markets.
The garbage lending has gone
to these private markets
and private credit has been very popular
and is now increasingly been over
allocated to buy large asset pools.
I remember Harvard University,
for example.
They've got like a 50 odd billion
dollar endowment,
and their donors pulled back
when they had uprisings on campus,
and the donors didn't
like what was going on.
So they stopped donating for a while.
And Harvard had no money, a $50 billion
endowment, and they couldn't pay salaries.
They couldn't pay the late bills,
they couldn't pay basic maintenance.
They had to go to the bond
market to borrow.
They tried to borrow about $4 billion,
I think.
I think they got away
with about $2.5 billion.
But it's fascinating
that you have a huge asset pool
that doesn't have liquidity
to pay the bills.
And I've also heard that another large
endowment, I think it's Yale University.
I might be wrong there,
but I think it's Yale.
They're talking about selling
some of their private equity stakes
because they don't have any liquidity
either.
And this has bled over
into the private credit market.
And I was at a Bloomberg broadcast,
an event in Hollywood, Paramount Studios,
I think it was.
And I got there early and
there was a panel before my fireside chat
where the members of the panel
were all significant executives
at some of the largest
private credit firms,
and it was really interesting
to hear them talk,
because the tone of the message
they were giving was far from bullish.
You know, it's kind of like when
when you talk to a junk bond manager, say,
what's the outlook for 2026?
And the most bearish thing
they're going to say is
we don't think spreads
can get any tighter.
We think they're
actually saying they're going to say
you're going to earn the coupon.
Well, these private credit
people were using words like tension
and lack of runway.
These are all euphemisms
for bad things happening.
And I think that, you know,
we start to see defaults.
And there's something on the Bloomberg
News wire today.
It's a, on top go
that speaks of a home, renovation
business that
was private credit, like $150 million,
issuance of private credit.
And it went to zero.
But anyway, it's called renewable.
Yeah. Like this.
And the funny thing
is, the argument for private credit
has always been a Sharpe ratio argument.
At the center of it.
It's that, you know,
you get the same return or maybe a little
better return than the public markets,
but you have much lower volatility.
Well, that's that's like saying
that you have no risk in a CD.
You don't have any interest rate risk
going to CD, which you buy a five year CD.
The price never changes.
Well, that's
just because you don't market to market.
You know, of course, a CD
that you bought five years ago
at, 1.5% is not worth.
You couldn't sell it at,
at a par value.
You're going to take a discount on it.
That's a private credit argument.
What really happens
and this is really borrowed
from private equity, which they use
the Sharpe ratio argument there too.
They say, well, you'll get the same return
or maybe a little better return
out of private equity
than you will out of the S&P 500.
But it's much lower volatility.
So what happens is
when the S&P 500 goes from 150,
the private equity firms
mark their positions down from 180.
Now they're not worth 80.
You couldn't sell them in 80.
But that's where they get marked.
And when the market recovers
back to 100 on the S&P 500,
they mark their private equity up to 100.
So lo and behold, both the S&P 500 and
the private equity have a return of zero.
But the the volatility of the S&P 500
is more than double
that of the private equity.
So it's basically a Sharpe ratio argument
based upon the volatility
being underreported.
And that's that goes on.
And all of these.
So these so-called private markets.
And now it's very fascinating
that this Renovo in the article today
it basically said that they had a chapter
seven filing
and bankruptcy filing and their asset, the
their liabilities were listed
as being between 100 and $500 million.
You just, you know, you check a box,
you'll forget a specific number.
So there's ranges and the whole range
that their liabilities were in
was between 100 and $500 million.
Their assets were listed as less
than $50,000 and less than $50,000.
What are you trying to tell me?
That there's these big private equity
firms and private private firms
with all of their resources, aren't aware
of that type of debt to equity ratio.
That's
obviously far into a bankrupt situation.
So what's going on here
that private equity firms had this marked
a few weeks ago at 100,
when it was obvious that their liabilities
were vastly,
vastly higher than their equity.
That should have been marked down to,
I don't know, 5025 one, but been 100.
What's going on? It's like there's
only one price for private.
There's only two prices
cuz yeah, 100 zero.
That's it.
And I heard a announcement made
from these private equity people
at that Bloomberg event.
But they're sort of like
as long as we believe that
we're going to get paid back,
we leave it at 100.
Well, okay.
But once once you have 150 million
plus dollars of liabilities
and less than $50,000 of assets, it's
pretty unlikely
they're going to get paid back.
The price should not be at 100,
but that's what's going on.
And so you have
that Sharpe ratio argument.
Then you have another argument
for private credit,
which is had been somewhat
valid, was just recent history.
I mean, performance, the five year
performance of private credit,
a couple of years ago
was definitely better than the five year
performance, at least reported performance
of of of public credit.
Private credit
did better than public credit.
So you had a, a trailing performance
argument, which, of course, trailing
performance
is no guarantee of future results,
which is stated on
every single prospectus.
But, recently
private credit is not outperforming,
obviously with bonds going from
100 and zero in a matter of weeks.
Public market has been performing
better than the private market.
And the most ridiculous argument of all
for private credit has been private credit
belongs in every portfolio
because it lets you sleep at night,
because it helps you ride out
the volatility of your public credit.
Again, that's just a repackaging
of the volatility.
If you don't market to market,
there's no volatility.
But if the price goes from 100 to 0
in a matter of a few weeks,
there's, there's something
something untoward is going on.
And so I'm very,
very negative on those types of,
you know, nontransparent markets.
It reminds me, I've been saying this
for probably two years now,
that the next big crisis
in the financial markets,
it's going to be private credit.
It's has the same trappings as subprime
mortgage
repackaging had back in 20 2006.
Now, it took a couple of years for it
to totally unravel.
So this stuff doesn't happen in a week
or a year even.
But I'm very negative on that.
And so where we stand on fixed income is
we don't like long term
treasury bonds at all
because we don't we don't think
people are going to want them
during the next recession.
The deficit is going to go up because
it always goes up during a recession.
The deficit,
the official deficit is about 6% of GDP.
That's a level that was associated
historically with the depths
of recessions.
Yeah, because of course it goes up
during recessions.
Well, when you go to a recession
the deficit goes up on average buy.
Well it depends what long
how long a time series you use.
But if you go back for about 50 years,
it goes up by about 4 or 5% of GDP.
In more recent recessions,
it's been a lot worse than that.
We could argue you could make the case
somewhat plausibly,
that the global financial crisis
was kind of weird
and that the Covid lockdown
recession was kind of weird.
But during those, the deficit went up
by about 8% of GDP on average.
So what happens
if the deficit goes from 6% of GDP
to 10% of GDP, or 12% of GDP,
or 14% of GDP?
All of those are possible.
What happens is that you have to blow up
the entire system,
because all the tax receipts
would go to interest expense.
We're already at a large percentage,
or about 1.4, $1.5
trillion of the $7 trillion budget
is now interest expense.
Of course,
we have a $2 trillion budget deficit.
So there's only $5 trillion of taxes.
And, you know, 30% of
that is going to interest expense,
and that is going to go higher.
And as interest rates are still elevated
from levels of 6
or 5 to 7 to 12 years ago,
the bonds that are rolling off
have an average coupon
for the next few years of
of a little bit below 3%.
Let's just call it 3%.
That means the fed funds at three
and 7/8 and treasuries
at four, up to four and a half.
That means that on average,
you're going to have
higher interest expense
on just rolling over the existing debt.
And of course, you're ladling
on a couple of trillion dollars
in on recessionary period.
And so I do a thing
at Grant's, conference,
Jim Grant
had his 40th anniversary conference
and a couple of years ago
and I did a my sit,
the simplest, most succinct presentation
I've ever given in my career.
I just went through the interest
expense problem using
plausible assumptions
on where the deficit's going.
And but the conclusion is,
and this is an art and not a science.
So there's a lot of assumptions
that can be challenged.
But putting it
in, you know, rather pessimistic light.
So I don't say this is the base case,
but by the year 2030, so five years
from now, it's quite plausible
that under the current tax system
and the current borrowing regime,
that we have 60% of all tax receipts
going to interest expense,
you can make it really, really
draconian and say, what if interest rates
go up to 9% on treasuries?
And what if the budget
deficit goes to 12% of GDP
and you make these kinds of,
you know, pessimistic assumptions?
Well, by around 2030, you would have 120%
of tax receipts going to interest expense,
which of course is impossible.
So that means that
something has to happen.
And we're not talking about,
you know, early in my career,
people were saying we can't keep borrowing
this money that was under Reaganomics,
which people thought was a bad idea
because it was deficit spending.
And they said, you know, where
we're going, we're going to be broke.
We'll be out of money in Social Security
and other entitlement programs by 2050.
And then ten years later,
you know, they moved it forward to 2040.
So it was initially supposed
to be like a 60 year problem.
And then ten years later
it was a 40 year problem,
and then it was a 20 year problem.
And now it's like a five year problem,
which means it's a problem in real time.
And something has to be done about this.
So long term treasuries
look vulnerable to me.
I still like short term treasuries
because I think the fed is likely
to cut interest rates,
and that definitionally leads
to lower interest rates
on, say, five years and in maturities.
Jeff, first of all,
I hesitate to ask a question here because,
you know, we could just let you go on.
And here you tear
particularly private credit to shreds.
That was great.
And thank you
also for the plug for both Bloomberg
Journalism and the Bloomberg
Hollywood event.
That's called Screen Time.
That's our conference there.
And then secondly, Joe, I was going
to make a Drake joke about private credit.
I was going to say going from 100
to 0 real quick in private credit
could be a really terrible Drake song,
like most of them are.
But that was five minutes ago, so
I don't think my joke is relevant anymore.
Jeff, I'm,
you know, in the 20 tens,
when we started this podcast ten years
ago, an investor could have a really nice,
you know, 60, 40 ish portfolio.
And there were all sorts
of beautiful things
that they have, particularly
that sort of inverse correlation that,
that exhibited
between treasuries and stocks.
So that, as you mentioned, typically in
a downturn, you get a stock market swoon.
Well, at least the slug of fixed income
that you owned, maybe it outperforms
then get a little smoothing, but
maybe you get some positive real rates.
It all works out really well,
I understand.
Okay, maybe there's still
some opportunities in the short end
because rates are going to go lower, etc.
maybe private, maybe public credit
has better standards than private credit.
We'll get into that.
But like,
do we have to go back and revisit
just the case or the for even having fixed
income in a diversified portfolio?
Well, I don't recommend
I know that look you had your
a fixed income portfolio manager.
So I understand
this is an existential question for you.
So I know there's but you know, like
you know, how how would you sell the case
for even having it?
It would be an existential question
for somebody that's
been 5 to 8 years in the business,
and it's just getting going.
Yeah. All right.
Because, you know, I've been
I've been at this for well over 40 years.
And I really don't,
don't need to make money
by managing other people's money at all.
So I, I'm very honest
what people like about me is
they say I get I get stopped on the street
and people say, I see you on, on TV.
I really look, I'm really a fan of yours
because you're a straight shooter.
You know, I don't.
Yeah, I don't talk any kind of
look whatsoever, but I, I think that
right now I think financial assets
broadly should be lower allocated,
have a lower allocation than typical.
You talk about 6040.
That means you 100% of financial assets
I think in equities today
you investors should have maximum 40%.
Okay.
And and most of that in non-U.S.
equities, particularly if you're a dollar
based investor like any a American
would normally typically be,
I think you want the is going to fall.
And so you're not going to be making money
on the currency.
Translation
you're going to be losing money.
And that's certainly been the case
so far this year.
Again, things are acting differently,
now that we're in a rising rate regime
and not a falling rate regime,
you're doing much better
as a dollar based investor
in local currency, emerging market stocks.
I mean, they're up
something like 25% year to date.
For a dollar based investor,
you're even better off in European stocks
because the dollar's down
versus versus the euro.
So I think the amount of people
should have in fixed income
should probably be about 25%,
not 40%, maybe 25%.
And I think that it should be some of it
in non dollar fixed income.
Again, emerging market fixed income,
which is by far the highest performing
sector for dollar based investors
in the fixed income market this year.
And so that leads to 40% that you're
not if you're at 40% in stocks
and in 20% or 25% in bonds,
you've got another 35, 40% to allocate.
And I've been very, very bullish on gold.
We do a, podcast that gets up on
our website in early January every year.
It's called,
Roundtable crime and Roundtable Crime.
And we have a bunch of thought leaders
there.
It's the same group every year.
And we go through one of the segments is,
you know what?
What are your best ideas?
And my number one
best idea for this year was gold.
Because I think gold
is now a real asset class.
I think people are allocating to gold,
not just the survivalists, you know,
and the crazy speculators, people
who are actually allocating
real money because it's real value
and of course, goals.
But being the top performing asset,
for the year,
certainly for the last 12 months.
And so I think investors
I was at one point advocating
25% of a portfolio in gold,
like things, real assets,
high quality land, gold,
you know, high value assets.
I think that's too high right now
because I think that that trade
has played out so very well.
And gold seems to have stalled out in
the last month or so at a very high level.
So is consolidating and scaling.
So I think it goes higher.
But for the time being
I'd probably be more like it's at 15%
or something like that.
In the rest,
I think I would be in cash because I think
valuations are just incredibly high.
And the, the health
of of the equity market
in the United States
is it's among the least healthy
in my entire career
in terms of the PE ratio, the cap ratio,
all the classic valuation
metrics are off the charts.
And of course, the market is incredibly
speculative.
And speculative
markets always go to insanely high levels.
It happens every time.
This is not you know,
obviously it happened in the dot coms.
It happened
the financials part of the GFC.
It's happening now in the
AI and data centers and all that stuff.
And you know, it's interesting
the probably the biggest thing
that changed the economy
and the world, in the last,
I don't know, 150 years
was the electricity.
Electricity being put into people's
homes was probably one of the biggest
changes of all time.
And of course, around 1900 people realized
the electricity to homes was coming.
And so
electricity stocks were in a huge mania,
and they did it incredibly well.
But the the relative performance
of electricity,
relative to the entire stock market, us
excluding electricity.
So everything else but electricity, the
electricity outperformance peaked in 1911.
How is this word
even broadly electrified by that?
You had to be a very rich person
to have electricity.
In 1911.
But yet that was
that was the outperformance.
And so it all gets priced in very quickly
and excessively, because people
love to look at the benefits
of these transformative technologies.
And they are transformative.
I mean, look at what happened
to some of the internet stocks.
They dropped 80, 80, 90% in the early OS,
but there were
many, many multiples of what their peak
was at that time.
But it gets priced in very, very early.
So I think that one has to be very careful
about momentum investing during,
mania periods.
And I feel like that's
where we are right now.
I just don't think there's any argument
against the fact that we're in a mania.
I want to go back to something
you said just then about how investors
should be reducing their dollar exposure.
So this is, you know, the Sell America
thesis that was very popular,
at the beginning of the year and per
your comments, is still very popular
with some people.
But we have seen in general,
you know, a little bit of a strengthening
in the dollar, ten year Treasury yields,
have been going down
compared to where they were earlier.
What accounts for,
I guess, the stickiness of U.S assets
in the global financial system
and in investors portfolios,
even when I think we can all agree
that there are challenges ahead
for U.S government debt and assets
in the form of high deficits
and spending and maybe political stasis
and things like that.
People are reluctant to make changes
to long standing paradigms.
One of the hardest things
to do in the investment business is to
significantly change your allocations
after you've been right.
That's counter-intuitive
to a lot of people,
but trust me, some of it's done
this for a very long time.
That's the hardest thing to do,
because when you when you do something
and it works really well, it it makes you
it gives you satisfaction
on every level, economic level
and emotional level, psychological level.
It helps you to have happy meetings
with your clients.
Just imagine if you bought Apple at,
I don't know, $5 a share
and it went up to, I don't know, 700.
And so you get to go to your review
with your client and you said, hey,
let's take a look at your portfolio.
Look at this cost five
less price 700 I am working for you.
You know, I've done a good job for you.
Well, when you sell Apple at 700, you
no longer have that line item.
And so you can't point to this
great thing that you did for that client.
And so people like to project
the past successes of the past.
They like to hang on to them
and project them into the future.
And that's a dangerous thing to do.
But when you check, I was
I was 100% dollar.
I would own
no foreign currencies for decades.
And then starting about 18 months ago,
I had to pull the trigger.
I had to say, you know what?
I, I don't think this paradigm is intact
any longer.
And I think you're going to lose money
by betting on the dollar
as a dominant asset.
And it's a scary thing to do
because you wake up in the morning
and you look in the mirror and say,
I'm looking at a at a strong dollar guy.
And then all of a sudden the next day
you say, I'm looking at a guy that's
no longer confident in a strong dollar
or pointing at the mirror going, who am I?
Yeah.
Like, you know,
I wonder why I should have to pay taxes.
Quite frankly, when I look in the mirror,
I don't identify as a billionaire.
I identify as a homeless 80 year old guy.
Why should I have to pay taxes
when I identify
as a as a destitute elderly man?
I don't understand.
So, yeah, I think other people, other
people might, identify you differently.
I want to go back to, the rates.
Question, as you mentioned, it's
sort of historically unusual
that we've seen this period of the fed
cutting rates for the last 13 months
and very little, downward action
and the long end of the curve.
We know everyone can sort of
look at the same math
that you look at
in terms of interest expense.
We know that the long end of curve
is very sensitive for housing.
And that's something
that's very important to the U.S. economy.
We know that President Trump would like
to see the long end of the curve go down,
perhaps because, he has deep familiarity
with it from his real estate days.
Do you think at some point in the sort of
medium term future, we're going to see
the return of proper yield curve control
and that we're going to see the fed
cut rates and not,
get the response desired at the long end.
And then more drastic action
is going to come such that actual steps
are taken to suppress that long.
And that's my base case.
And I've been talking about this now
for nearly two years that we cannot afford
the market to, set interest rates
if the deficit spending continues,
it won't be tenable.
So what has to happen?
It's going to be
some sort of drastic measures.
And I'm not exactly sure what those
drastic measures are going to be.
There's a number of candidates for them.
We could do what we did from after World
War two until the mid 50s,
when inflation was rising and we had
significantly negative real yields,
and we had inflation go up to around
8% and the yield curve was kept.
The long bonds were kept at 2.5%.
So you can you can absolutely manipulate
the yield curve.
Japan did that for decades.
For decades they kept rates at zero
even though there was no demand.
I actually had a meeting with,
the guy that ran the biggest pension
plan in the world as one of the Japanese
public pension plans, and I
was really anxious to sit down with them.
And I said,
I really want to ask you this question,
do you actually own these
negative yielding jobs?
And he actually laughed out loud
when asked, what's he said, of course, now
nobody owns them
except the Bank of Japan and the
and the institutions that are forced
to buy them by the Bank of Japan.
So it's a it's a real thing.
We did the United States for a decade.
They did in Japan for decades.
And, Secretary Bezzant has alluded
to the fact
that maybe that's on the table,
some sort of interest rate manipulation.
So what this leads to
is a really interesting dilemma,
because what I think is my, my
roadmap for the future.
And of course, there's many variations
one could use.
But the starting point for me
is that interest rates will rise
until such time is there uncomfortably
high for the Treasury Department.
What is that? Where is that 5%? 6%?
My guess is six is that it's the highest
that it would be full on
on uncomfortable,
full on at 6% on the long end.
So what happens is
you'd want to avoid long bonds
while the market forces are in play.
And, Joel, you said that long
rates are down very much
since the fed started cutting.
No, no, they're up a lot.
Wall rates are up a lot.
The fed started cutting.
This is the first time it's ever happened.
They're up by almost 100 basis points.
With the fed cutting.
That's just never happened before.
But with interest rates
rising as the fed is cutting,
at the long end, what's going to happen
is they'll get to a point
where all of a sudden it's
too uncomfortable, and then something
dramatic will happen that something
dramatic could simply be the government.
The Treasury Department
buys the treasuries.
And if they announce that they're going
to buy treasuries and control long term
interest rates, you would have a 30 point
rally in the long bond in a week.
So there's a very,
very, sensitive, strategy here
where you have to be very negative
over the normal course of things.
And then once the intervention comes
in, there's going to be a step
for a significant step
function lower in yields.
And so you have to try to figure out
how you're going to do that.
Pivot.
That's what I spend most of my time
thinking about
when it comes to the Treasury market
these days of a low.
For now, it's way too early for them
to panic and start manipulating the rates.
What?
They might manipulate our mortgage rates.
They could. They could absolutely. By,
Judy Mae's, Fannie Mae's, Freddie Mac's.
The government guaranteed mortgages
and drive those yields down much closer
to where Treasury yields are.
And there's no rule that says
they can't go through Treasury yields.
I mean, there are instances
where non Treasury yields
are lower than Treasury yields
at the same maturity.
Just earlier
this year, there was a corporate bond
that was lower yielding
than the same maturity Treasury bond.
That also happened in the early 80s
when IBM bonds traded a lower
yields than Treasury bonds.
At the same maturity,
because investors had greater confidence
in the payback of IBM than they did in
what they thought was a bad strategy
under Reaganomics.
And that has begun to enter
the picture here in 2025,
with corporate bonds periodically,
not only the very best ones, of course,
but like Microsoft or something
like that, trading through treasuries.
And so that's it,
that something is up here.
The other thing that they might do,
and there was a white paper
written about this just about a year ago.
Now that said maybe we should restructure
the treasuries held by foreigners,
which is a very strange thing to say.
This is the Mar-A-Lago accord, right?
Yeah, I don't think.
Yes it is.
I don't know how you define
who are the foreigners.
Foreigners can hide behind entities. Yeah.
And so it looks like
they're not owned by foreigners.
So I'm not exactly sure what foreigners
mean.
But why put the word foreigners in there?
Why not just say we're going to
restructure the Treasury debt full stop.
What does that mean?
Well, one way to to save on
interest expense, to get it back
down from 1.5 trillion to the 300 billion
it was a couple of years ago.
Why don't you just say all the treasuries
that exist today?
We're changing their coupons.
The ones that have a coupon above one.
The coupon is now one.
The ones that have a coupon less than one.
The coupon stays the same.
That would save
a tremendous amount of interest expense.
Of course, it would cause a disastrous,
tumultuous time in the government
bond market.
But people say to me,
you always talking about this
debt problem, what's the solution?
The solution is get to a point
where people won't lend the government
money anymore, that the government
can't borrow any money, so that if you
if you restructure treasuries, that way,
they'll be a couple of generations.
The government won't be able to borrow
any money anymore.
And that would actually put us
in a better place than where we are today.
I want to ask another question
about private credit,
but just before I do, I'm curious,
do you ever talk to Bezzant
about your ideas for how to fix the U.S.
Treasury
market, basically, or voice your concerns?
I think he watches my CNBC segment
just press conference.
All right.
Let's go back to private credit
for a second,
because that's obviously
the topic du jour.
And as Joe pointed out,
one of the things that has really grown
exponentially over the past ten years,
you've said on the podcast just now,
and you've said it before, that you think
private credit is the candidate
for another financial crisis.
And I understand and the marking issue,
I understand the liquidity mismatch.
But when I look at private credit,
maybe what's missing in terms
of some of our more recent
financial crises is that leverage
built on top of leverage aspect.
Can you give
oh, that's that is that is credit.
It's leverage.
This is yeah. Okay. Explain that.
Explain that.
Because as far as I know,
we're not seeing the scale of stuff
getting re bundled as we saw,
for instance, in the financial crisis.
Well that's true.
You're not getting the re bundling.
But you are having
there's a lot of leverage.
They're raising money
and then they're borrowing money to buy
more private credit.
It's absolutely leverage upon leverage.
And the other thing,
while they're not bundling like putting,
you know, the thing about the financial
crisis is you took triple be rated
and it's questionable
whether they even deserve a triple B
rated thing and creating Triple-A
rated securities out of them.
I mean, just just that
that alone should make you just just,
you know, just stop
even thinking about investing it.
There's suddenly a Triple
A's turned into a triple.
Triple B has turned into triple AA.
But one thing they are doing
is issuing publicly traded vehicles, daily
nav vehicles to allow
Main Street America mom and pop investors
to avail themselves of this wonderful,
fantastic opportunity
of private credit,
which is totally a liquidity mismatch.
You've got daily Nav funds investing
in things that don't trade at all.
And so once there's
a run on those, on those vehicles
and I don't know how popular they've been,
but they're certainly been touted.
But if they become popular in any way,
you're going to have the catalyst
for a tremendous selling deluge
because there is no fuel
what to want to redeem.
And they won't be able
to get their money out.
And once you get that, once people
we're the
trouble always comes in
financial markets is when people buy
something that they think is safe,
it's sold to them as safe.
But it's not.
Say you buy a Triple-A rated subprime
mortgage pool.
You think it's safe because it's
Triple-A rated, but it's not safe.
It's extremely dangerous.
You buy CDO equity
and you buy CDO squared equity back
before the global financial crisis.
And there isn't any real equity.
It's I buy your equity, you buy my equity.
It's we're all it's just a game
that's being played.
So to make an illusion of liquidity,
that's where private credit is right now.
It's an illusion.
They don't even claim it's liquidity.
But if you package it
into a publicly traded vehicle
that trades on a daily basis,
you have the perfect
mismatch of no liquidity with a vehicle.
The promise is liquidity.
It's looks like it's safe
because you could sell it any day,
but it's not safe because the price
at which you sell it will be gapping
lower, gapping lower, island
gapping lower day after day after day.
And so that's where that's
where the risk is.
But these things go on forever.
One of the things about the investment
business is it's hard.
It's difficult
enough to be so-called right
about the direction of things we're going.
But it's impossible to be both right
on the direction and correct on timing
things that if even if you're
right on the direction, it's
going to take a lot longer than you think.
I turn negative on the packaged mortgage,
non-guaranteed mortgage market in 2004.
It took three years for it
to even start to decay.
So these things take forever and it goes
on much longer than you think, you know.
Remember
I turned negative on the Nasdaq maximum
negative September 30th of 1999.
I looked like a moron three months later
because the Nasdaq went up 80%
in the fourth quarter of 1999.
But if you had gone short the Nasdaq
September 30th of 1999, 18 months later,
you had a profit of 64%,
even though it went up 80%
in the first three months, it dropped.
So much in the ensuing 15 months
that the short would have made you
a profit of of of a very handsome profit
in a very difficult market,
just very quickly, are you betting against
private credit now?
I have no way to do that.
Yeah, I, I don't,
I don't really short bonds.
Shorting high
yielding bonds is a really difficult thing
because the cost of carry is just brutal
every
day that it doesn't it doesn't decline.
You're paying out a very high,
you know, rate.
And so you're losing money all the time.
So I don't really do that.
What I do is I just don't allocate to it.
I allocate to things that will do better,
you know, that will be immune,
relatively immune or fully immune
from the knock on effects
of, of of deterioration in private credit.
So that would that would mean higher,
you know, higher, credit things,
you know, using foreign currencies
more than, more than typically.
But no, I don't think you can really short
private credit.
What have you learned
in, your career about the,
longevity
in drawdowns or underperformance?
Because, as you mentioned,
you can be right.
Or you can be
you can correctly identify a medium
or long term trend, but it sometimes
takes a while to play out.
Whether it's the case from September
99th to the peak,
that's not actually that long,
that was closer to six months or,
being bearish on some of
the housing assets starting in 2005.
That took a little bit longer.
What how do you survive
as a portfolio manager
and be willing to take time
where you're just an accept
that you're going to underperform
for a while? Well, you have to have,
think very carefully about your time
horizon.
When I started in this industry,
when the first things I was tasked to do
was to do a study on what would happen
if you had perfect foresight,
in financial markets, perfect foresight.
Of course, you can do a study like that
by using historical data.
So you take stocks, bonds, real estate,
commodities, every every asset class.
And you just look
at the historical returns
and you can say, let's,
let's say at the beginning of every year
I invest with a five year horizon, and I
pick the asset class that I know with
metaphysical certitude is going to have
the highest return for those five years.
Because I'm looking at historical data,
I came to the conclusion
that if you had a five year horizon,
you would go out of business, even if you,
with metaphysical certitude, would have
the highest performing asset class.
And that's because so often
the first two years of the five years
that best performing asset
class was not a good performer at all.
It was very frequently back end loaded.
So I said, we cannot invest other people's
money with a five year horizon.
I think that most
people that invest other people's
money use to short of a horizon.
However, a lot of a lot of investment
managers talk about
they have their constantly reallocating,
they're constantly read.
You know,
they have a little one week horizon
at a weekly meeting in The Changer.
That's not going to work.
It's not going to work because the chance
of you being right in a week is very low.
You're even if you're going to be right
for over a two year period, your chance
of being right in a week is very low.
So I kept modulating time
horizon, and I came to the conclusion
that the sweet spot was between 18 months
and two years.
For a time horizon and what I've learned
is that having done
that, I have a 70% hit rate.
I've got a long enough career
in enough, strategies where it's
statistically significant
and I have a 70% hit rate,
which means I'm right 70% of the time,
which means I'm wrong 30% of the time.
So I've been at this for over 40 years.
So I've been wrong for more than 12 years.
Right.
But thank God they haven't been in a row.
Really.
Three years is when everyone falls out.
If you underperform, you're one,
you're two.
When you're three, you're gone.
You know, if you're
if you're wrong five years in a row,
they shut your Janus unconstrained
bond fund
because you can't have sequential years
of outperformance like that.
It's a very specific example, Geoff.
Wonder where that came from. Well yeah.
So but the the
it really it comes down to about
having a not the sweet spot on.
Yeah.
Not being overly overly active
and not being overly you know,
fixated on your long term idea.
And I had a match to do that.
I've never I've never really had
three years in a row of underperformance.
So, that's, that's been a good thing.
And it's probably I call myself off
as an anxious or churchgoer
because The Last of the Mohicans,
John Fenimore Cooper I'm the last one.
I'm the last man standing
when I started in this.
But every single person of significance
that's been in the business
since I started my career,
they're all retired or gone.
I'm the last one standing.
Dana Emery was the only one left,
and she was a Dodge and Cox.
But she retired,
at the end of June, so I'm I'm.
It's less the Mohicans.
Just gorgeous.
How does that work, Jeff?
Junkies kind of,
very quickly,
you know, again, we're sort of
we're very we're being very introspective
and retrospective on the show.
But over the past ten years,
what's been the thing that surprised you
most, either in terms of the markets
or the financial industry itself?
The thing that's surprising
and as equally distressing as surprising
is the magnitude of money printing
that occurred in 2020, 2021, 2022.
I just the fact that the Federal Reserve
broke the law and bought corporate bonds
surprised me.
It probably shouldn't have surprised me
because they broke
they broke the law when they,
modified mortgages
during the global financial crisis.
That was that was not allowed
for the prospectuses
of trillions of dollars of securities,
but they did it anyway.
And so what I've learned
is that the rules can be changed.
Yeah.
In spite of the fact
that they seem to be set in stone.
And that's why I say
and what I say this people really
act very in a,
in a shocked type of reaction.
They don't believe that
they can restructure the Treasury debt,
but yes, they can.
They can restructure the Treasury debt
and I think that
that sort of
has to happen in some fashion,
whether it's the coupon adjustment
that I talked about, whether it's
whether it's doing the yield curve control
that Joel brought up earlier,
I think something like
that has got to happen, because
when something is impossible
and paying our interest back
in today's buying power
dollar is impossible to pay off our debt.
It's impossible.
Then you have to open up your mind
to a radical change in the rule system.
And of course, that is happening
on every level.
I mean, you talk to,
you look at surveys of people
that are in, say, 35 and younger.
They don't believe in the institutions
of this country at all.
Yeah.
They don't believe in the Constitution.
They don't believe in
religion. They don't believe
they don't believe in anything.
And they people need something
to believe in.
And that's what has to replace the system,
a system that people can believe in.
And what's been floated now
just blows my mind, and that is
that we're going to
because we have tariffs that are raising
a few hundred billion dollars a year.
If they stay in place.
Well, that means that
we should give $2,000 to everybody.
It's a tariff dividend.
We don't have any money.
We're borrowing $2 trillion.
We don't have $2,000 to throw away
at people.
Again. We didn't.
We learned that in 2020 to 2022 that
giving money to people causes inflation.
Remember,
people talk about, modern Monetary theory.
What a joke I've heard of.
You know, you never heard anybody
talking about that anymore.
Because by what is not true.
So how come no
one talks about that anymore?
Because inflation went to 9.1% is true.
Can I use one last question?
Are you like it seem like you know,
you mentioned Trump
floating the idea of a $2,000 tariff
dividend to the public.
It's a problem.
But do you like are you
was there an opportunity, in your view,
for Trump to have changed the status quo,
like are you disappointed that someone
with sort of Trump's persona energy
sort of perceived outsider status did not
do, has not done
anything that actually changes
some of whether the fiscal
or economic, trajectory.
You can't the problem is,
look, look,
look at this government shutdown.
You know what is going on here.
Why why do we have to pay taxes
if the government is shut?
Should shut
taxes not be charged for 41 days.
Shouldn't
you have, like an 11% tax rebate?
Because what's going on?
Well, it's just because there's
this massive entrenched interests
that is the kind of unit party government
that will fight tooth and nail.
Just look at all the lawfare.
Look at look at all of the indictments,
all the stuff.
I mean, they'll do anything they can
to hold on to power until such time
as the people that vote these people
in say no mass, no more of this.
And that began with Trump.
It's been furthered
just this month with Mamdani.
Mamdani one, because people do not believe
it's a it's a little bit different.
It's Trump
was more like the lower middle class.
They felt that
nobody was listening to them.
Now it's just young people,
just broadly people under,
I don't know, 35 years old, people
that lost three years of education,
with lockdowns
and all of these, these policies,
they feel like they have no chance of ever
having the life experience
that the baby boomers had.
Home prices are more affordable,
less affordable than they've ever been.
People have educations that are worth
anything.
Jobs aren't available. Nobody's hiring.
They feel like there's no future for them
that looks anything
like what they look at.
Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer and Mitch
McConnell and all these other people had
they don't have it.
And so they are not
going to go along with this.
And so that's
why Mount Tammy One, it's just like,
I don't have a shot here in New York City
as a young person.
And that's what's taking over.
And so Trump can't do it himself.
He he caught on to something
that was obviously,
kind of hibernating within the psyche
of part of the population,
but it's now become a generational thing.
I wouldn't be surprised.
Talk about another crazy gun lock idea.
I wouldn't be surprised
if they are putting in place an age tax,
not a wealth tax,
which they're doing to a certain extent
through electricity bills
and stuff like that these days already.
But you can put it together an age tax
that if you're over age 55,
you have a surtax based upon
you had a better environment
to accumulate wealth
than the subsequent generations have.
And so you you should
you should give some of that back.
I think that might actually happen.
That would be a popular platform
with certainly a specific demographic.
Are you going to run off to your plans?
Absolutely.
Positively, no.
Not yet.
All right. You know, chat.
All right.
We shall leave it there. Jeff,
thank you so much for coming on.
All thoughts. Really appreciate it. Well,
thanks for having me.
I'm sure kind of all over the map today,
but I hope your audience enjoys it.
They will.
Thank you so much Jeff. Really
appreciate it.
Clearly a lot to unpack there. Jeff.
One of the things
actually this was towards the end.
So that's why it's in my mind.
But you know, when he was talking about
the fed buying corporate bonds in 2020,
I really think that was
an underappreciated moment in financial
markets because I remember, again,
we're being very introspective here.
I remember writing pieces
about the corporate bond
market
being problematic in like circa 2015.
Yeah.
And I
used to have commenters who were like,
okay, so what's the worst case scenario?
And the most extreme scenario
that we used to talk about was, well,
what if the fed has to come in
and buy corporate bonds?
That was the extreme scenario,
and that's what happened in 2020.
So I kind of
I take his point about how quickly
these things can change
and you can deviate from norms.
Totally.
Remember we interviewed Bill
gross on the beach a couple of years ago,
and he called out Jeff for like,
being the pretend bond King.
Anyway, I liked, Jeff returning the favor
by pointing out
the short lived, the short lived Janice
Unconstrained Fund.
That, bill ran after having left, Pimco.
So I see that the rivalry,
the rivalry continues.
Yeah. We should have them both on
and just let them do it.
Just let them do good.
How it seriously, it's like, just do it.
Yeah. Just both. Come
on. People would love their.
Oh, I'm sure I'm
sure that would raise some money
for charity or something like that.
That was great.
Okay.
It Jeff, if you are still listening
and Bill, if you are listening,
we should put pretend banking
in the headline and maybe lure him on.
Yeah.
Open invitation to come on in and debate.
But on a serious note.
More serious note,
I thought the point about how everyone's
been piling into private credit
because it's outperformed public credit.
That is changing now, you know,
empirically, that has changed this year.
But then secondly,
everyone's been piling into private credit
because of that low volatility pitch,
which is one
that we've heard
a number of times on the podcast.
Now, this idea that, well,
you don't have to market to market.
And that's actually a big strength
that sales pitch starts to lose
a lot of power and conviction
when you're going from 100 zero
in the space of one month.
I don't like how their new ones
like every day.
Yeah.
What I'm saying,
it's like each one of these little credit
cockroaches are pretty small
in the grand scheme of things.
But two things a
they're small and yet they seem
to be touching a wide number of love.
And I don't like how they keep
popping. Right.
I'm a little I'm a little anxious
because you think the scale is small,
but then it just keeps the news story.
Well, this is also why why the cockroach
analogy is so perfect, right?
Because if you see one,
you know you have more than one.
Yeah, I once read an entire book
about cockroaches
just because I figured, like,
know your Enemy in New York.
And it was actually really interesting,
Shall we leave it there?
Let's leave it there. Okay.
