This is Fairwater 2, the current most powerful data center in the world. Network optics in this building is almost as much as all of Azure across all our data centers two and a half years ago. It's got what, five million network connections. This would be effectively a 10x increase. 10x from what GPD5 was trained with. You've got all this bandwidth between different... sites in a region and between the two regions. So is this like a big bet on scaling in the future that you anticipate in the future? There's going to be some huge model that needs to require two whole different regions. The goal is to be able to put these things together across sites. Fairwater 4, which you're going to see under construction nearby, will also be on that one petabits network, so that we can actually link the two at a very high rate. And then basically we do the IWAN connecting to Milwaukee, where we have multiple other Fairwaters being built.
