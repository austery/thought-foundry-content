From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Will
 Jarvis
 in
 for
 Tracy


Mumford.
 Today's
 Monday,
 December
 15th.


Here's
 what
 we're
 covering.


>> What
 we
 saw
 yesterday
 was
 an
 act
 of
 pure


evil,
 an
 act
 of
 anti-semitism,


an
 act
 of
 terrorism
 on
 our
 shores.


In
 Sydney,
 Australia,
 authorities
 say


they've
 concluded
 that
 a
 father
 and
 son


were
 responsible
 for
 a
 massacre
 this


weekend
 at
 a
 Jewish
 holiday
 celebration.


At
 least
 15
 people
 were
 killed
 and


dozens
 more
 were
 rushed
 to
 hospitals


after
 the
 two
 men
 opened
 fire
 yesterday


at
 Bondi
 Beach,
 a
 popular
 tourist
 spot


that
 was
 packed
 with
 people
 celebrating


the
 first
 night
 of
 Hanukkah.


>> We
 could
 just
 hear
 the
 gunshots
 and
 they


were
 just
 so
 loud
 and
 we
 didn't
 know


which
 way
 that
 they
 were
 shooting.
 So,


we
 were
 like
 running
 on
 the
 open
 road.


>> At
 one
 point,
 a
 bystander,
 who
 officials


called
 a
 genuine
 hero,
 snuck
 up
 and


tackled
 one
 of
 the
 shooters
 from
 behind.


The
 man
 wrestled
 a
 long
 gun
 from
 the


attacker,
 who
 then
 retreated.
 Police
 say


they
 shot
 and
 killed
 one
 of
 the
 men
 at


the
 scene,
 the
 50-year-old
 father.


Authorities
 expect
 to
 bring
 criminal


charges
 against
 the
 son,
 who's
 24,
 but


they
 haven't
 released
 their
 names
 or


provided
 details
 about
 the
 men's
 exact


ideology.
 Mass
 shootings
 like
 this
 are


extremely
 rare
 in
 Australia,
 which
 put


in
 place
 strict
 gun
 laws
 after
 a
 deadly


attack
 in
 the
 '90s.
 The
 government


melted
 down
 as
 many
 as
 a
 million
 guns,


according
 to
 some
 estimates,
 and


essentially
 banned
 many
 types
 of
 rifles.


Police
 say
 one
 of
 the
 suspects
 in


yesterday's
 shooting
 was
 a
 member
 of
 a


gun
 club
 who
 had
 a
 recreational
 hunting


license
 that
 allowed
 him
 to
 have
 a


weapon.


The
 shooting
 comes
 at
 a
 time
 when
 many


Jewish
 Australians
 were
 already
 on
 edge.


Since
 the
 October
 7th
 attacks
 in
 Israel


in
 the
 ensuing
 war
 in
 Gaza,
 Jewish


groups
 say
 there's
 been
 a
 wave
 of


anti-semitic
 violence
 in
 Australia,


including
 arson
 attacks
 that
 have


targeted
 an
 Israeli
 restaurant,
 a


daycare
 center,
 and
 a
 synagogue.


Meanwhile,
 in
 Providence,
 Rhode
 Island,


>> is
 the
 suspect
 behind
 the
 shooting,
 are


they
 still
 in
 this
 community?
 Have
 they


left
 the
 state?


>> Honestly,
 we
 have
 no
 way
 of
 knowing.
 Uh,


and
 uh,
 and
 the
 investigation
 is


ongoing.


>> Officials
 say
 they're
 still
 searching


for
 a
 gunman
 who
 opened
 fire
 on
 campus


at
 Brown
 University,
 killing
 at
 least


two
 students
 and
 injuring
 nine
 others.


>> Obviously,
 we
 have
 um
 murderer
 out


there,
 frankly.
 But
 the
 fact
 of
 the


matter
 is
 is
 that
 a
 law
 enforcement
 has


the
 tools
 necessary
 to
 solve
 this
 case.


>> The
 attack
 happened
 shortly
 after
 400


p.m.
 on
 Saturday
 when
 a
 masked
 man
 burst


into
 a
 lecture
 hall
 where
 dozens
 of


students
 were
 studying
 for
 a
 final


econom.
 An
 eyewitness
 told
 the
 Times
 the


gunman
 started
 shouting
 something,
 then


opened
 fire
 as
 students
 scrambled
 for


cover
 behind
 seats
 in
 the
 auditorium.
 On


Sunday
 morning,
 officials
 said
 they


detained
 a
 person
 of
 interest,
 though
 by


late
 last
 night,
 they
 announced
 they


hadn't
 found
 enough
 evidence
 to
 charge


that
 person
 with
 any
 crime.
 Authorities


say
 they're
 searching
 for
 more
 video


footage
 that
 could
 lead
 them
 to
 a


suspect.
 Brown
 University
 says
 it's


canceled
 classes
 and
 exams
 for
 the
 rest


of
 the
 semester.


In
 Los
 Angeles,
 police
 say
 they're


investigating
 an
 apparent
 homicide
 after


the
 Hollywood
 actor
 and
 director
 Rob


Reiner
 was
 found
 dead
 yesterday
 along


with
 his
 wife
 Michelle.
 Officers
 found


the
 bodies
 at
 the
 Riner's
 home
 in


Brentwood,
 a
 wealthy
 LA
 neighborhood.
 As


of
 last
 night,
 police
 said
 they
 were


trying
 to
 get
 a
 search
 warrant
 for
 the


home
 and
 had
 not
 identified
 a
 suspect.


Reiner
 was
 78.
 He
 was
 the
 son
 of
 a


pioneering
 TV
 comedian
 who
 created
 The


Dick
 Van
 Djk
 Show.
 In
 high
 school,
 he


was
 drawn
 to
 theater
 and
 later
 became
 a


popular
 sitcom
 actor
 before
 going
 on
 to


direct
 a
 slate
 of
 beloved
 films.


>> Inconceivable.


>> You
 keep
 using
 the
 word.
 I
 do
 not
 think


it
 means
 what
 you
 think
 it
 means.


>> He
 worked
 across
 a
 range
 of
 genres.


There
 was
 the
 childhood
 classic
 The


Princess
 Bride,
 the
 mockumentary
 This
 is


Spinal
 Tap,
 as
 well
 as
 romantic


comedies.
 I
 came
 here
 tonight
 because


when
 you
 realize
 you
 want
 to
 spend
 the


rest
 of
 your
 life
 with
 somebody,
 you


want
 the
 rest
 of
 your
 life
 to
 start
 as


soon
 as
 possible.


>> Like
 when
 Harry
 met
 Sally
 in
 the


courtroom
 drama,
 A
 Few
 Good
 Men.


>> YOU
 WANT
 ANSWERS.


>> I
 WANT
 THE
 TRUTH.
 YOU
 CAN'T
 HANDLE
 THE


TRUTH.


>> Reiner
 also
 led
 a
 prominent
 political


life.
 He
 was
 a
 champion
 of
 liberal


causes
 like
 gay
 marriage.
 And
 in
 the


'90s,
 he
 spearheaded
 a
 ballot
 initiative


to
 boost
 taxes
 on
 tobacco
 to
 pay
 for


early
 childhood
 development
 programs.
 In


a
 statement,
 former
 President
 Barack


Obama
 mourned
 the
 deaths,
 saying
 that


even
 beyond
 his
 success
 in
 Hollywood,


Reiner
 had
 a
 quote,
 "Deep
 belief
 in
 the


goodness
 of
 people
 and
 a
 lifelong


commitment
 to
 putting
 that
 belief
 into


action.


The
 Times
 has
 learned
 that
 in
 an


unprecedented
 arrangement,
 the
 Trump


administration
 has
 been
 providing
 the


names
 of
 all
 air
 travelers
 in
 the
 US
 to


immigration
 officials
 under
 the
 program,


which
 was
 started
 in
 March,
 but
 hadn't


been
 previously
 reported.
 The


Transportation
 Security
 Administration


is
 providing
 a
 list
 multiple
 times
 a


week
 to
 ICE
 officials.
 The
 list
 tells


them
 who
 will
 be
 coming
 through
 airports


so
 that
 agents
 can
 arrest
 anyone
 with
 a


deportation
 order.
 Airline
 passengers


have
 long
 been
 subject
 to
 federal


scrutiny.
 For
 example,
 passenger


information
 is
 typically
 compared


against
 terrorist
 watch
 lists.
 But
 one


former
 TSA
 official
 said
 this
 is
 the


first
 time
 the
 agency
 has
 gotten


involved
 in
 domestic
 immigration
 or


criminal
 matters.
 It
 comes
 as
 the
 White


House
 has
 been
 trying
 to
 boost


cooperation
 between
 federal
 agencies
 to


carry
 out
 President
 Trump's
 goal
 of
 the


largest
 deportation
 campaign
 in
 US


history.
 Earlier
 this
 year,
 the
 IRS


agreed
 to
 hand
 over
 the
 addresses
 of


migrants
 to
 ICE,
 though
 that
 move
 was


blocked
 in
 federal
 court.
 For
 the


moment,
 it's
 not
 clear
 how
 many
 arrests


have
 been
 made
 as
 a
 result
 of
 the
 TSA's


work
 with
 ICE.
 Immigration
 activists


have
 criticized
 the
 cooperation
 with
 a


director
 at
 the
 group
 Human
 Rights


First,
 telling
 the
 Times,
 "It's
 an


attempt
 to
 terrorize
 and
 punish


communities
 and
 will
 make
 people


terrified
 to
 ever
 leave
 their
 homes."
 A


spokeswoman
 for
 the
 Department
 of


Homeland
 Security
 said,
 quote,
 "The


message
 to
 those
 in
 the
 country


illegally
 is
 clear.
 The
 only
 reason
 you


should
 be
 flying
 is
 to
 self-deport
 home.


And
 finally,
 there's
 a
 major
 shopping


spree
 going
 on
 right
 now
 in
 Canada,


where
 people
 are
 stocking
 up
 on
 American


liquor
 while
 they
 can.
 Earlier
 this


year,
 when
 President
 Trump
 announced


stiff
 new
 tariffs
 on
 Canada
 and


threatened
 to
 make
 it
 the
 51st
 state,


many
 Canadian
 provinces
 protested
 by


pulling
 US
 spirits
 from
 their
 shelves.


In
 the
 second
 quarter
 of
 this
 year,


Canadian
 imports
 of
 American
 liquor


plunged
 by
 85%
 according
 to
 the
 head
 of


an
 industry
 group.
 Now,
 a
 number
 of


provinces
 have
 decided
 to
 temporarily


restart
 sales
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 their


remaining
 stock.
 Some
 of
 the
 proceeds


will
 be
 donated
 to
 charity.
 The
 brief


buying
 window
 has
 led
 to
 daily
 lines
 at


government-run
 liquor
 stores
 in


Manitoba,
 according
 to
 the
 head
 of
 the


province.
 He
 said
 Jack
 Daniels
 seemed
 to


be
 particularly
 popular
 along
 with


barefoot
 wine.
 The
 owner
 of
 a
 pub
 and


restaurant
 in
 Winnipeg
 said
 that
 while


there
 had
 been
 what
 he
 called
 a
 lot
 of


patriotism
 around
 the
 movement
 to
 buy


Canadian,
 he's
 eager
 to
 get
 his
 order
 of


Kentucky
 bourbon
 and
 Tennessee
 whiskey


that's
 on
 the
 way.
 He
 told
 the
 Times,


quote,
 I'm
 anxiously
 looking
 forward
 to


being
 able
 to
 serve
 a
 proper


old-fashioned.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
 I'm
 Will


Jarvis.
 We'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow.
