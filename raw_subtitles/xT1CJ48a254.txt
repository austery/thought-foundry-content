You know who Warren
Buffett or Peter Lynch is
because they're such outliers.
The rest of us, we're
playing the loser's game.
We get emotional. We overtrade.
We don't pay attention to
costs. We ignore taxes.
We make all of these mistakes
that if only we avoided them,
we would do so much better.
You are going up against every
other investor and trader
who similarly thinks that
they can outsmart the markets.
History tells us we are simply terrible
at playing that game.
I'm Barry Ritholtz,
and I'm chairman and
chief investment officer
of Ritholtz Wealth Management.
My new book is "How Not to Invest:
The Ideas, Numbers, and
Behaviors That Destroy Wealth,
And How to Avoid Them."
- [Narrator] Investing is a loser's game.
Here's how to win it.
- So why do we even invest?
We want to put our money to work
because 20, 30, 40 years from now,
we're going to stop working and retire,
and we're going to need
something to pay our bills.
Most of us aren't going to be able to live
on just Social Security,
and so we put our money to work
so that it'll compound faster
than the rate of inflation.
And really it's your job as an investor
to not interfere with your
portfolio's ability to compound
over that time.
The loser's game is a concept
created by Charlie Ellis
in a paper he wrote 30, 40 years ago.
Eventually it became a book
called "Winning the Loser's Game."
And Ellis, legendary guy,
chairman of the Yale endowment,
on the board of directors
of The Vanguard Group,
Ellis noticed that investing and tennis
were both very similar in
that they're two games in one.
There's a winner's game
and a loser's game.
What does that mean?
Well, let's use tennis as Ellis's example.
There are two games in tennis:
the game the professionals
play, the top 0.01% of players,
and then there's the
game the rest of us play,
us 99.9% of the world who are amateurs.
How do the professionals play?
They play the winning game.
They win by scoring
points. They serve aces.
They hit with power and accuracy.
They kiss the line.
They do fancy drop
shots, lots of top spin.
They keep the ball away
from their opponent.
That's not how the loser's game is played.
That's not how the amateur plays.
How do us amateurs play?
We lose through unforced errors.
What sort of unforced errors?
We double fault because we're
trying to serve too hard.
We hit the ball long, we hit it wide,
we hit it into the net,
we hit it right to our opponent.
Instead of trying to
play outside ourselves
beyond our own ability,
us amateur tennis players
just return the ball,
just keep it in play.
Don't try and kill it.
Don't try and hit the line.
You are not skillful enough to do that.
If you make fewer unforced errors
and you let your opponent
make those mistakes,
you will win the loser's
game by making less errors.
And so Ellis compared tennis to investing
and he found something really fascinating.
A handful of professionals,
a tiny number of people,
they can pick stocks and
know when to sell them.
They can identify which sector
or country to invest in.
They can time the markets.
That's the 0.01% of people,
and they're household names.
You know who Warren
Buffett or Peter Lynch is
because they're such outliers.
The rest of us, we're
playing the loser's game.
We're unfortunately underperforming
because we're making all of these errors.
We get emotional. We overtrade.
We don't pay attention to
costs. We ignore taxes.
We make all of these mistakes
that if only we avoided them,
we would do so much better.
That's why Ellis thought
investing and tennis were so similar.
Most of us are playing the loser's game
and playing it badly.
If we make fewer unforced errors,
we would just be so much better off.
So a number of academic studies have found
that a surprisingly few
percentage of stocks
are actually driving market returns.
Professor Hendrik Bessembinder
at Arizona State University did a study,
and he found that just 2% of stocks
are responsible for all the returns
that we've seen over the past 75 years.
Depending on the country you look at,
maybe it's a little more, a little less,
but it averages around 2%.
How is that possible?
Well, some stocks are
up a little each year.
Some stocks are down a little each year.
Some stocks are flat.
They all kind of cancel out.
A handful of stocks are down a lot.
Some stocks get crushed and go to zero.
That leaves very few stocks
that are the giant winners
that drive returns.
In the context of the loser's game
where we want to make fewer mistakes,
every decision we make is
another opportunity for error.
And given how much the odds
are stacked against us,
if only 2% of stocks are
driving most of the returns,
what are the odds
that we're going to
pick that 1 in 50 stocks
that's going to be a big winner?
First, you have to identify a company
that over the next 1, 3, 5, 10 years
is going to grow its
revenue and its profits.
That's hard to do.
Secondly, you have to buy
that stock at the right time
and at the right price.
Overpaying for a stock isn't
going to help you at all.
Third, you have to be willing to hold that
through all the ups and downs
that company is going to go through.
Economic cycles, missed
revenue expectations,
missed profits.
Stocks don't go up in a straight
line, they're up and down.
And sometimes when stocks pull back,
it's just a temporary setback
and eventually they recover.
Knowing when something is
just pulling back temporarily
or that its best days are behind it
and it's on the way down permanently,
that's a really difficult thing to do.
Emotionally, we have all these
sunk costs in that stock.
We've researched it,
we've investigated it.
If it's helped make us money,
we're loathed to cut it loose
because hey, we're tied up.
It's the endowment effect.
I own it, therefore it
has to be pretty good.
It's very, very difficult
to tell the difference
between a Microsoft and an Intel.
Both added to the Dow Jones
Industrial 25 years ago,
Microsoft has done exceedingly well.
Intel not so much.
How can you identify that in advance?
Being added to the Dow is
like, hey, you've made it.
This is the top group of stocks
as decided by the editors of Dow Jones.
And now when we look at the
performance of these two stocks,
they've gone in completely
different degrees.
The odds are stacked against you
being a successful stock picker.
And to put some numbers to that,
let's take a look at professional
mutual fund managers.
In any given year,
less than half of them
beat their benchmark,
meaning they're going to
do better than the market.
So that's telling us fewer than 50%
are actually picking stocks better
than just a boring, cheap
index is performing.
You take that one year and
expand that out to five years,
it turns out 80% of them
fail to beat their benchmark.
You take that to 10
years and it's over 90%.
Net of fees and taxes,
less than 1 in 10 mutual fund
managers beat their benchmark.
And over 20 years, it's virtually nobody.
And so understanding
how much the odds are stacked
against you as a stock picker
is why indexing has become
so popular these days.
People have figured out,
I'm not going to try and
pick the next Nvidia,
I'm going to buy all the stocks
and that way I'm guaranteed to own that.
And it prevents you from
allowing your behavioral errors
to interfere with your portfolio.
You are not selling a stock prematurely.
You're not timing the market.
If you do regular dollar cost average,
if you buy a chunk of stock,
you buy a specific index
every month, every paycheck,
you're guaranteed over the long haul
to do better than 99% of
your fellow investors.
So when you're thinking about
putting money in the market,
you need to have a plan.
And I try and lay out
a number of specific steps you can take
really to prevent
yourself from interfering
with your money's ability
to compound in the market.
So first step is to automate the process.
Take the emotions out of it.
With your 401k or 403b
or whatever your
tax-deferred saving plan is,
you are making contributions
every paycheck.
If the market goes up,
great, it means what you
bought before is higher.
If the market goes down,
great, you're buying
more at a better price.
Over the fullness of time,
that sort of dollar cost averaging,
every paycheck, every month,
means that you are buying regardless.
And the math tells us that's
the most effective way
to invest for the future.
Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson once said,
"Investing should be boring.
It should be like watching
paint dry or grass grow.
If you want to have some fun,
take $800 and go to Vegas and gamble."
Don't gamble with your portfolio.
Let's talk about diversification.
Investing is really a
very humbling exercise.
We all have to admit to ourselves,
we don't know what stock,
what commodity, what sector, what country,
what asset class is going
to do best this year.
You know, you get this
quilts, this patchwork
showing year by year
what have been the best
performing sectors in the market,
and it's completely
different year by year.
One year REITs are at the
top of the league table.
The next year it's tech stocks.
The next year it's small cap value.
It's all but impossible to predict.
And so rather than throw
darts, rather than guess,
we own a broad diversified portfolio.
We own a little bit of everything.
And that means you're always participating
in the sector that's going up.
You probably wish you
had more of it this year,
and then next year when
it's not doing well,
you're happy that you didn't overload
that particular sector.
Diversification means
you're broadly participating
in every asset class
rather than speculating,
rather than guessing.
It's the best way to make sure
you own the best-performing assets.
You know, Jack Bogle,
founder of Vanguard Group,
famously said, "Instead of hunting
for a needle in a haystack,
just buy the whole haystack."
You have to be aware of costs.
That's just simple math.
The more you're paying for
a mutual fund or an ETF,
the more that drags on your performance.
In fact, we've seen a number
of studies over the years
that over the course of 25, 30 years,
a high-cost portfolio,
everything else being equal,
will generate 20% less value
at the end of those 25, 30
years than a low-cost portfolio.
A study on the Bogle effect,
Jack Bogle was the founder of Vanguard
that specializes in very low-cost funds,
you could look at BlackRock
and State Street are
similarly low-cost funds
are known for that.
The Vanguard effect has
identified that by 2016,
Vanguard fee pressure had
essentially saved investors
$1 trillion over the previous 30 years
since Vanguard launched in the mid-1970s.
Since 2016, over the next decade,
it's about another
trillion dollars in fees
that have been saved
by the Vanguard effect.
It's that much more money in portfolios.
It's that much more money that's compound
and that investors own.
And so fees matter a great deal.
Go back to the bad old
days of the 1960s and '70s.
Mutual funds used to cost
1, 1.5, 2% of your assets.
Some funds came with a
front end load of 5%.
In other words, you give the
fund company a hundred bucks
and they invest 95 of it for you.
Think about what a drag
that is on returns.
And really the technology
didn't exist for us
to understand this easily.
People just saw the markets
were going up from World War II
to, let's call it 1966,
was a really substantial gain in assets.
Nobody really focused on
what's driving these gains
and what are the headwinds
we're up against.
And then something similar took
place in the 1980s and '90s.
We had a big bull market.
Around the '70s and '80s
was when we first started paying attention
to the data as to the drag
fees put on performance.
So it's not just mutual
funds, it's transaction costs.
You know, it used to cost $300,
$400, $500 to buy a stock.
It's free today.
We deregulated the
markets in the early '70s,
and that allowed brokers
to compete on fees.
And we went from a few hundred
bucks to a hundred bucks.
I remember the commercials
for the various online trading
shops, $8 transactions.
Eventually that became free trading.
And so the cost structure of that is gone.
And then when we look
at what's taken place
with mutual funds and ETFs,
it used to be 1, 1.5, 2% to buy those.
They're well under half a percent today.
You could buy a broad
index like the S&P 500
or the Vanguard Total Market.
It's five bips.
The cost is practically nothing,
and that just compounds in your favor.
The lower your costs,
the more you keep at the
end of your investing life.
You know, back in the bad old days,
you would get a quarterly
update of your portfolio,
you'd get a statement
and it was a big deal.
Everybody sat around waiting
for their statements to arrive
and you would see how well you did.
And that was probably too
extreme in one direction.
Technology has given us the ability
to watch our portfolios second
by second, tick by tick.
That's too far in the other direction.
You should check your
portfolio occasionally
just to see how it's doing.
Monthly is probably plenty.
If you are concerned about
something in particular
and you start noticing yourself
checking your portfolio more frequently,
sometimes that's a little
bit of an alert that,
hey, maybe you have too much risk on
and you're too concerned
about your exposure,
or maybe you are entering a
period of market volatility
and that's going to create an opportunity
for you to buy stocks at a cheaper price.
People talk about the
importance of rebalancing.
Let me give you a little context
of what rebalancing means
and how you should think about it.
The idea is that stocks
go up over the long run.
And so if you have a portfolio
that let's say is 70%
equities and 30% bonds,
in the event of a market selloff,
hey, maybe you end up 60%
equities and 40% bonds
because of how those two
asset classes have moved.
What we suggest to people
is that they rebalance into equities.
You sell a little bit of
the bonds that ran up,
you buy a little bit of
the equities that ran down.
And essentially what you're
doing is selling bonds high
and buying stocks low.
It's sort of counterintuitive.
The time to rebalance into equities
are when we have these deep
market corrections or drawdowns,
down 20, 30, 40%, that's
where you want to engage that.
Most of the time,
you shouldn't really be worrying
too much about rebalancing.
I don't think it's that important
for the average investor's portfolio.
So, "Nobody knows anything"
comes from William Goldman,
who was a screenwriter
in the '60s '70s, '80s.
And he wrote a pretty scathing
confessional about Hollywood
and how bad executives in
the various studios were
at predicting which films would do well.
Almost all the studios
passed on "Star Wars,"
on "Raiders of the Lost Ark," on "E.T."
And it's only when one random person says,
"All right, let's give this a shot,"
that some of these movies go
on to become blockbusters,
despite most of Hollywood
not thinking there was anything there.
Taking that same concept
to the world of forecasts.
Forecasts are when a market
professional or expert
or talking head or pundit says,
"I believe this asset class
will be this price at this time."
Specific asset, specific time
and date, specific price.
And when we look back through the history
of expert forecasts,
it turns out that the experts
are no better than any of us.
Wharton Professor Philip
Tetlock did a study on this.
He looked at thousands and
thousands of forecasts.
He found they were no better
than the average person's prediction,
and the average person's
prediction is pretty bad.
Just take a look at the past few years.
Heading into 2020,
nobody had a pandemic closing the economy.
Oh, and by the way, from March
till the end of the year,
the market's going to rip up 69%.
That wasn't in anybody's forecast.
Nobody had the Russian
invasion of Ukraine in 2021.
2022, nobody had the Federal Reserve
raising interest rates 500 basis points,
sending stocks and bonds
down double digits.
That's a very rare occurrence
for stocks and bonds
to both be down that
much in the same year,
hadn't happened for 40 years.
And so it turns out,
the future is just so
filled with random events
and unanticipated things occurring
that making forecasts out a year,
it's really a fool's errand.
And if we make our investments
based on these forecasts,
we're really destined to do poorly.
We have to be aware of our market timing,
and becoming fearful and emotional
every time the market has a pullback.
We look at the history of markets,
they're down 5% twice a year,
they're down 10% two out
of every three years,
and they're down 20% fairly regularly.
If you respond to every
time the market twitches,
you're going to prevent your portfolio
from compounding over time.
We think we can time markets.
Here's the fascinating thing
about news and market timing.
Markets are pretty efficient.
You know, they're not
100% perfectly efficient,
but if you're seeing
something on a website,
on TV, in a newspaper,
the odds are that every other person
with capital at risk in the markets
has not only seen it, but acted on that.
And that news is already
reflected in stock prices.
So you see the cover of a magazine
or the headline in The
Wall Street Journal,
that information is already in the price.
To imagine that you're going to read that
and then act on it
in a way that's going
to be beneficial to you,
you're essentially trading
on old information.
I know we call it news,
it's news to you, but
it's old to the market.
What studies have shown us about people
who sell when markets make a low,
in other words, they
panic sell into a crash.
About 30% of these people
never return to equities ever again.
That's an amazing statistic.
Think about what happened
when people panic sold
January, February, March 2009.
The market has had an incredible
run over the next 15 years,
and nearly a third of people
who sold into those lows
never got back into equities.
That's devastating to a
portfolio's performance.
Avoiding these unforced errors,
having a plan and sticking to it,
that's the secret of
winning the loser's game.
