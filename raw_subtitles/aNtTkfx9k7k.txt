From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Natalie


Kitroof.
 This
 is
 the
 Daily.


For
 more
 than
 six
 decades,
 the
 United


States
 has
 tried
 and
 failed
 to
 topple


the
 regime
 in
 Cuba.
 But
 after
 ousting


Cuba's
 closest
 ally,
 Nicholas
 Maduro,


and
 pushing
 the
 country
 into
 dire


economic
 crisis,
 the
 Trump


administration
 is
 closer
 than
 ever
 to


forcing
 radical
 change
 on
 the
 island.


Today,
 my
 colleagues
 Francis
 Robas
 and


Michael
 Crowley
 on
 how
 this
 latest


escalation
 is
 pushing
 Cuba
 to
 the
 brink


and
 whether
 this
 time,
 finally,
 the
 US


government
 will
 get
 what
 it
 wants.


It's
 Tuesday,
 February
 17th.


Frenchie,
 it's
 wonderful
 to
 have
 you


here
 on
 the
 daily.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> So,
 I
 think
 it's
 fair
 to
 say
 you
 are
 the


New
 York
 Times
 Cuba
 whisperer.
 You've


been
 covering
 Cuba
 for
 how
 long?


Decades.
 decades.
 I
 actually
 looked
 it


up
 today.
 I
 wanted
 to
 see
 what
 was
 my


first
 article
 about
 Cuba
 and
 it
 was
 the


summer
 of


1993.


Wow.


So,
 you
 obviously
 have
 seen
 this
 country


go
 through
 crisis
 after
 crisis
 in
 that


time,
 but
 I
 think
 there
 is
 something


about
 this
 moment
 that
 feels
 different,


at least
 for
 me,
 looking
 at
 what's


playing
 out
 on
 the
 island.
 Does
 that


feel
 right
 to
 you?
 100%.
 I
 interviewed


an
 economist
 who
 told
 me
 a
 funny
 joke


that
 says,
 "How
 come
 Cubans
 have
 such


short
 index
 fingers?"
 Well,
 I
 don't
 know


why.
 Well,
 it's
 from
 banging
 their


finger
 on
 the
 table
 for
 years,
 saying,


"Next
 year
 we'll
 be
 having
 roast
 pork
 in


Havana
 at
 Christmas."
 They've
 been


saying
 this
 for
 60
 years.
 That
 this
 is


the
 last
 year
 of
 the
 Cuban
 regime.
 But


then
 this
 time
 all
 the
 people
 that
 I


interview
 very
 serious
 people,


academics,
 economists,
 people
 who
 have


written
 books
 on
 the
 subject,
 they
 all


say
 the
 same
 thing.
 They
 say,
 "You
 know


what?
 This
 time
 it
 might
 actually
 be


true."
 And
 the
 word
 that
 you
 hear
 over


and
 over
 again
 is
 unsustainable.


>> This
 current
 situation
 in
 Cuba
 is


unsustainable.


>> And
 what's
 unsustainable
 about
 it?
 What


are
 the
 people
 that
 you're
 talking
 to


saying?
 The
 big
 issue
 right
 now,
 Cuba


produces
 about
 40%
 of
 the
 oil
 that
 it


needs
 for
 domestic
 purposes.
 And
 so
 it


was
 receiving
 the
 other
 60%
 either
 from


Venezuela
 or
 from
 Mexico.
 Now
 it
 is


getting
 zero
 of
 that.


>> Acute
 fuel
 shortages
 have
 gotten
 even


worse
 after
 US
 President
 Donald
 Trump


announced
 two
 weeks
 ago
 that
 he'd
 impose


tariffs
 on
 any
 country
 sending
 oil
 to


Cuba.


The
 standoff
 between
 the
 two
 countries


is
 raising
 fears
 over
 a
 full-blown


humanitarian
 crisis.


>> And
 so
 you're
 starting
 to
 see
 buses
 are


not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 run.
 At the


>> same
 time,
 hospitals
 have
 already
 shut


down
 in
 the
 last
 days.


>> And
 schools
 and
 universities
 have
 had
 to


reduce
 their
 teaching
 schedules
 to
 save


fuel.


>> They're
 announcing
 that
 banks
 will
 only


be
 open
 by
 certain
 days.


>> Everyone's
 riding
 tricycles
 now.
 The
 car


business
 is
 falling
 apart.
 people.


>> They're
 going
 to
 get
 to
 a
 point
 where


they
 don't
 have
 the
 gasoline
 to
 deliver


food
 to
 the
 store.
 So,
 what
 are
 people


supposed
 to
 do?


>> I'm
 going
 to
 look
 for
 a
 better
 life


because
 things
 here
 are
 really
 bad.


>> That's
 the
 big
 thing
 that
 people
 are


wondering.
 How
 long
 does
 this
 go
 on
 for


and
 how
 bad
 does
 it
 get
 before
 somebody


cries
 uncle?


>> Right.
 You're
 saying
 basically
 that
 a


corner
 has
 been
 turned
 in
 Cuba
 after


years
 and
 years
 of
 suffering.
 There
 may


be
 a
 kind
 of
 change
 coming.
 And
 what
 we


understand
 from
 your
 reporting
 and
 from


honestly
 the
 public
 statements
 of
 the


administration
 is
 that
 this
 crisis
 that


Cuba
 is
 facing
 now
 is
 intentional.
 It's


the
 result
 of
 a
 carefully
 planned


policy,
 right,
 by
 the
 Trump


administration.
 Can
 you
 just
 lay
 out
 for


me
 why
 why
 has
 the
 US
 been
 so
 dead
 set


on
 toppling
 the
 regime
 in
 Cuba?


>> I
 guess
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 the
 simple
 fact


that
 the
 United
 States
 government
 does


not
 want
 a
 communist
 regime
 in
 their


backyard.
 I
 mean
 a
 one
 party
 state,
 a


centralized
 economy,
 lack
 of
 basic


freedoms,
 jailed
 dissident.


This
 is
 the
 antithesis
 of
 what
 the


United
 States
 represents
 and
 what
 it


wants
 in
 the
 Western
 Hemisphere,


>> right?


>> And
 so
 you
 have
 to
 turn
 the
 clock
 back


to
 1960.


Fidel
 Castro
 wins
 in
 1959,
 but
 it's
 in


1960
 that
 he
 announces,
 you
 know,
 his


intention,
 his
 sort
 of
 socialist
 zeal.


>> Cuba
 goes
 on
 a
 patriotic
 binge
 after
 the


government
 seizes
 the
 score
 of
 US


companies


>> and
 he
 starts
 confiscating
 lots
 of


industries,


oil
 refinery,
 the
 sugar
 industry,
 the


telephone
 company,
 banks,
 never
 mind


private
 property,
 you
 know,
 people's


houses.
 So
 that
 gives
 the
 United
 States


the
 reason,
 you
 know,
 oh,
 oh,
 you're


going
 to
 confiscate
 our
 oil
 company?


Well,
 watch
 this.
 So,
 this
 is
 where
 the


United
 States
 government
 really
 starts


its
 very
 aggressive
 stance
 against
 Cuba


and
 its
 quest,
 its
 decades
 long
 quest
 to


topple
 this
 regime.


>> Right.


>> The
 assault
 has
 begun
 on
 the


dictatorship
 of
 Fidel
 Castro.
 Cuban


>> in
 1961.
 We
 invaded
 Cuba,
 landing
 over
 a


thousand
 men
 at
 the
 Bay
 of
 Pigs
 in
 what


was
 absolutely
 disaster
 for
 the
 United


States.


Short
 time
 after
 that,
 the
 Kennedy


administration
 made
 a
 full
 embargo
 on


Cuba
 and
 that
 meant
 cutting
 off
 any
 kind


of
 ability
 Cuba
 would
 have
 to
 buy


anything
 on
 the
 international
 market.


>> So
 near
 total
 isolation.


>> Yes,
 near
 total
 isolation.


It
 shall
 be
 the
 policy
 of
 this
 nation
 to


regard
 any
 nuclear
 missile
 launched
 from


Cuba
 against
 any
 nation
 in
 the
 Western


Hemisphere
 as
 an
 attack
 by
 the
 Soviet


Union
 on
 the
 United
 States
 requiring
 a


full
 retaliatory
 response
 upon
 the


Soviet
 Union.


>> And
 then
 1962,
 Cuban
 missile
 crisis.
 You


know,
 we
 almost
 went
 to
 nuclear
 war
 with


Cuba
 because
 it
 was
 discovered
 that
 Cuba


had
 allowed
 Russia
 to
 place
 nuclear


missiles
 on
 the
 island.
 And
 so
 that
 was


an
 incredibly
 tense
 moment.


>> During
 all
 this
 time,
 the
 CIA
 is
 trying


to
 kill
 Fidel
 Castro
 left
 and
 right.
 I


mean,
 there's,
 you
 know,
 lots
 of
 lore


about
 poison
 cigars
 and
 things
 of
 that


nature.
 And
 he
 always
 survived.
 They


always
 came
 out
 standing.


And
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 they
 did,
 I
 think


it's
 really
 important
 to
 underscore
 that


one
 of
 the
 mechanisms
 that
 the
 Cuban


government
 had
 was
 migration.
 It
 was
 an


escape
 valve.
 Whenever
 things
 got
 too


hot,
 when
 the
 discontent
 got
 to
 be
 too


much,
 when
 it
 was
 clear
 that
 people
 were


really
 unhappy,
 Fidel
 Castro
 would
 open


the
 doors
 and
 let
 people
 out.
 And
 so,


for
 example,
 in
 the
 spring
 of
 1980,
 you


had
 a
 a
 major
 incident
 that
 was
 known
 as


the
 Mariel
 boat
 lift.


>> Today,
 23
 boats
 filled
 with
 over
 800


Cubans
 reached
 Key
 West,
 Florida.
 US


Marines.


>> It
 started
 with
 a
 protest
 at
 the


Peruvian
 embassy
 and
 it
 ended
 with


125,000
 people
 getting
 on
 boats
 and


literally
 just
 sailing
 to
 South
 Florida.


The
 president
 has
 literally
 opened
 the


floodgates,
 placing
 no
 limitations
 on


the
 number
 of
 Cubans
 entering
 the
 United


States.


And
 you're
 saying
 Fidel
 Castro
 actually


encouraged
 this.
 He
 said,
 "Please
 leave.


These
 boats
 can
 go
 wherever
 you
 want


them
 to.
 Don't
 stay
 here."


>> That's
 absolutely
 right.
 You
 know,
 for


for
 many,
 many
 years
 until
 fairly


recently,
 maybe
 about
 a
 decade
 ago,
 it


was
 very
 difficult
 to
 leave
 Cuba.
 you


had
 to
 get
 an
 exit
 card
 to
 go.
 And
 so


this
 was
 his
 blanket
 exit
 card
 for


everybody.
 People's
 families
 were
 coming


from
 from
 the
 United
 States
 with
 boats


to
 pick
 people
 up
 like,
 "Okay,
 we
 can


go.
 Let's
 go."
 He
 also
 emptied
 prisons


and
 mental
 institutions.
 But
 the
 thing


that's
 really
 important
 to
 note
 is
 that


it's
 a
 technique
 that
 the
 Cuban


government
 has
 used
 periodically
 for
 the


past
 66
 years.


>> Got
 it.


>> But
 it
 wasn't
 the
 only
 way
 that
 they


survived.
 The
 other
 thing
 that
 was
 a


really
 important
 issue
 was
 that
 they


were
 able
 to
 turn
 to
 the
 Soviet
 Union


and
 the
 Soviet
 Union
 kept
 Cuba
 afloat.


But
 the
 Soviet
 Union
 collapsed
 in
 1991,


>> right?


>> And
 that
 launches
 a
 really,
 really


horrible
 time
 for
 Cuba,
 which
 is
 known


very
 euphemistically
 as
 the
 quote


unquote
 special
 period.
 And
 it's
 a
 time


of
 really
 severe
 food
 shortages.
 Um
 just


a
 lot
 of
 suffering
 throughout
 the
 entire


island.
 In
 fact,
 it
 launches
 another


migration
 episode.


>> So,
 it's
 just
 yet
 another
 moment
 in
 this


history
 where
 everybody
 thought,
 "Wow,


it
 can't
 get
 worse.
 Look
 at
 how
 bad
 this


is.
 This
 is
 absolute
 chaos."
 Everyone


was
 convinced
 that
 it
 had
 to
 be
 the
 end.


In
 just
 thinking
 about
 the
 history
 that


you've
 sketched
 out
 here,
 it
 feels
 like


at
 every
 turn,
 the
 US
 thought
 that
 it


was
 creating
 the
 conditions
 that
 would


internally,
 you
 know,
 force
 people
 to


rise
 up
 inside
 of
 Cuba,
 that
 it
 would


force
 change
 from
 within
 by
 creating


this
 pressure
 cooker.
 But
 the
 Cuban


regime
 responded
 to
 that
 by
 saying,


"Well,
 it's
 not
 a
 pressure
 cooker
 if
 we


have
 a
 valve."
 And
 that
 valve
 is
 sending


people
 to
 the
 United
 States,
 basically


exporting
 the
 people
 who
 are
 most
 likely


to
 push
 for
 change
 from
 within.


>> That's
 absolutely
 right,
 Natalie.
 You


know,
 and
 the
 end
 result
 of
 that
 is
 this


huge
 CubanAmerican
 community
 in
 South


Florida
 that
 has
 become
 a
 really


powerful
 movement
 that
 has
 Congress


people
 who's
 have
 always
 helped
 dictate


Cuba
 policy.
 And
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of


people
 who
 were
 supporters
 of
 this
 idea


that
 the
 US
 had
 to
 play
 a
 key
 role
 in


helping
 topple
 the
 Castro
 government.
 So


back
 in
 Cuba,
 the
 regime
 has
 survived


this
 special
 period,
 but
 they've
 lost


their
 biggest
 benefactor
 in
 the
 Soviet


Union.
 So
 what
 do
 they
 do?
 Well,
 when


you
 lose
 your
 sugar
 daddy,
 you
 got
 to


get
 yourself
 another
 one.
 So
 when
 Soviet


Union
 fell,
 they
 started
 relying
 on


Venezuela.


Venezuela
 kept
 them
 afloat
 for
 almost
 25


years.
 The
 other
 thing
 they
 did
 was
 open


to
 tourism.
 So,
 let's,
 if
 you'll
 allow


me
 to
 jump
 forward
 in
 time
 a
 little
 bit,


President
 Obama
 decides
 that
 he's
 going


to
 try
 the
 exact
 opposite
 of
 what


everybody
 else
 tried,
 you
 know?
 So,


everybody
 else
 is
 trying
 to
 suffocate


Cuba
 to
 get
 them
 to
 fold.
 He's
 like,
 you


know
 what?
 We're
 going
 to
 do
 the


opposite.
 We're
 going
 to
 let
 people


visit.
 We're
 going
 to
 let,
 you
 know,


private
 businesses
 get
 licenses
 to
 do


business
 there.
 They
 were
 hoping
 that


the
 opening
 of
 Cuba
 will
 allow
 it
 to


fall,
 right?
 Will
 get
 all
 the
 Cubans
 on


the
 island
 to
 say,
 "Wait
 a
 second.
 You


mean
 there's
 an
 internet,
 there's
 cell


phones,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 want
 a
 piece
 of


that.
 And
 so
 from
 about,
 let's
 say,


2015,
 16,
 17,
 you
 see
 this
 big
 boom
 in


tourism.
 And
 that's
 another
 point
 where


people
 think,
 oh
 yeah,
 now
 the
 Cuban


government
 is
 really
 going
 to
 end


because
 there's
 no
 way
 that
 people
 in


Cuba
 will
 see
 how
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world


lives,


>> right,


>> and
 be
 able
 to
 stick
 it
 out
 with
 this


government.
 The
 idea
 from
 the
 Obama


administration
 at
 the
 time
 was,
 okay,


sticks
 have
 not
 worked
 in
 Cuba
 for
 like


half
 a
 century,
 so
 we
 should
 try


something
 else.
 And
 that
 something
 else


should
 be
 exposing
 Cubans
 to
 the


benefits
 of
 capitalism.


>> That's
 exactly
 right.
 It
 didn't
 exactly


work
 because
 the
 Cuban
 government
 saw
 it


as
 a
 Trojan
 horse
 and
 they
 put
 up
 a
 lot


of
 obstacles
 to
 that
 opening.
 So
 other


than
 a
 few
 years
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 tourism,


the
 economic
 opening
 never
 really


happened,


>> right?


>> But
 when
 Trump
 comes
 along,
 he
 basically


says,
 "Okay,
 well
 that's
 enough
 of
 that,


you
 know."
 So
 he
 reverses
 just
 about


everything
 that
 President
 Obama
 had


done,
 you
 know,
 and
 he
 puts
 back
 in


travel
 restrictions,


restrictions
 on
 sending
 money
 to
 Cuba,


restrictions
 on
 doing
 business
 there.


and
 he
 takes
 things
 very
 much
 back
 to


the
 traditional
 Republican
 we're
 gonna


choke
 these
 people
 until
 they
 fold


strategy.


>> So
 back
 to
 sticks
 basically.


>> Back
 to
 sticks.
 That's
 was
 always
 going


to
 be
 Trump's
 plan.
 And
 what's


interesting
 is,
 you
 know,
 the
 Trump


administration
 ended,
 Biden
 took
 his


place,
 and
 he
 didn't
 change
 that
 much
 to


be
 honest.
 M
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 measures


stayed
 in
 place,
 but
 then
 Trump
 won


again
 and
 you
 get
 the
 sense
 that
 this


administration
 decided
 this
 is
 our
 shot,


that
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the


administration
 that
 succeeds
 where
 so


many
 before
 them
 failed.


And
 what
 they've
 done
 has
 really
 brought


the
 Cuban
 government
 to
 its
 worst
 crisis


that
 it
 suffered
 in
 its
 67
 years
 in


existence.


Its
 future
 has
 never
 been
 more


precarious.


After
 the
 break,
 we
 get
 inside
 the
 Trump


administration
 strategy
 with
 my


colleague
 Michael
 Crowley.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


So,
 Michael,
 our
 colleague
 Frenchie


Robas
 just
 told
 us
 that
 the
 Cuban
 regime


is
 more
 vulnerable
 than
 it's
 ever
 been


because
 of
 the
 policies
 that
 the
 Trump


administration
 has
 carried
 out.
 You


cover
 the
 administration's
 foreign


policy.
 So,
 take
 me
 inside
 that
 story.


What
 are
 you
 seeing?


>> Well,
 this
 is
 very
 much
 by
 design.
 you


the
 Trump
 administration


until
 now
 has
 not
 talked
 a
 lot
 about


Cuba
 but
 has
 always
 had
 big
 plans
 for


Cuba
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 to


understand
 how
 much
 this
 is
 coming
 from


Marco
 Rubio


>> Rubio
 is
 driving
 this
 and
 we
 may
 be


approaching
 an
 endgame
 that
 Rubio
 has


worked
 towards
 for
 decades
 now


>> okay
 so
 Rubio
 is
 absolutely
 central


you're
 saying
 why
 is
 this
 his
 singular


obsession
 ession.
 Just
 tell
 me
 what
 his


motivations
 are.


>> You
 know,
 let's
 start
 with
 his


background
 and
 origins.
 Uh
 Rubio
 is


Cubaname.


His
 parents
 fled
 to
 the
 United
 States


from
 Cuba
 before
 Castro
 took
 power
 in


1959,
 but
 were
 very
 strongly


anti-Castro.
 So
 Rubio
 grows
 up
 in
 a


community
 of
 Cuban
 exiles
 and
 he
 makes


it
 really
 his
 signature
 issue
 as
 he


dives
 into
 the
 politics
 of
 South
 Florida


where
 Cuban
 exiles
 who
 are
 vuperatively


opposed
 to
 the
 Cuban
 regime
 have


enormous
 influence.
 And
 Rubio
 has
 made


his
 opposition
 to
 the
 Cuban
 government


and
 his
 efforts
 to
 promote
 its
 overthrow


central
 to
 his
 political
 identity
 for


his
 entire
 career.
 And
 maybe
 the
 most


vivid
 detail
 to
 underscore
 that
 is
 when


Rubio
 himself
 ran
 for
 president
 in
 2016.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you.


>> He
 announced
 his
 campaign
 at
 what
 is


known
 as
 the
 Freedom
 Tower
 in
 Miami


>> in
 this
 very
 room
 five
 decades
 ago.


Tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 Cuban
 exiles
 began


their
 new
 lives
 in
 America,


>> which
 was
 the
 first
 stop
 for
 those
 Cuban


refugees
 to
 sort
 of
 announce
 their


arrival
 in
 the
 US.
 And
 if
 America
 once


again
 accepts
 the
 mantle
 of
 global


leadership,


>> by
 ending
 the
 near
 total
 disregard
 for


the
 erosion
 of
 democracy
 and
 human


rights
 around
 the
 world,
 especially


Cuba,
 Venezuela,
 Nicaragua.
 It's


interesting
 you're
 saying
 his
 career
 was


forged
 inside
 this
 Cuban-American


community
 that
 Frenchie
 told
 us
 this
 as


well
 has
 been
 both
 powerful
 and
 very


keen
 on
 toppling
 the
 Castro
 regime.
 This


is
 Rubio.
 This
 is
 his
 people.


That's
 right.
 This
 is
 at
 the
 core
 of
 his


personal
 and
 political
 identity.
 And
 I


think
 that
 for
 him,
 possibly
 even
 more


than
 for
 President
 Trump,
 getting
 rid
 of


the
 current
 Cuban
 government
 would
 be
 a


sort
 of
 crowning
 legacy
 achievement
 that


would
 make
 him
 feel
 like
 his
 political


career
 had
 all
 been
 worth
 it.
 It's
 all


been
 kind
 of
 working
 toward
 this
 if
 he


can
 get
 it.


And
 obviously
 now
 he
 has
 the
 reigns
 of


US
 foreign
 policy
 as
 secretary
 of
 state


as
 national
 security
 adviser.
 So
 how


have
 you
 seen
 this
 play
 out
 for
 him?


Well,
 you've
 seen
 this
 incredible
 focus


by
 the
 Trump
 administration
 on
 the


Western
 Hemisphere
 and
 in
 particular


Latin
 America.
 and
 Rubio
 really


spearheaded
 the
 Trump
 administration's


pressure
 on
 Venezuela's
 leader
 Nicholas


Maduro,
 which
 ultimately
 led
 to
 Maduro's


capture
 in
 early
 January.
 Now,
 this


actually
 goes
 straight
 to
 the
 Cuba


question
 that
 we're
 talking
 about.
 I


know
 from
 my
 reporting
 that
 Rubio
 has


made
 a
 very
 explicit
 connection
 between


bringing
 down
 Maduro
 and
 bringing
 down


the
 Cuban
 government.


>> The
 thinking
 is
 that
 Venezuela
 and
 Cuba


became
 very
 close
 allies
 over
 the
 past


few
 decades.
 The
 Cubans
 provided


Venezuelans
 with
 military
 training
 and


intelligence
 and
 the
 Venezuelans
 were


shipping
 large
 amounts
 of
 oil
 to
 Cuba.


Cuba
 doesn't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 oil


suppliers.
 So
 Rubio's
 calculus
 was
 if


you
 can
 get
 rid
 of
 Maduro
 and
 cut
 off


those
 Cuban
 oil
 supplies
 to
 Havana,
 that


is
 a
 huge
 blow
 that
 brings
 you
 a
 lot


closer
 to
 bringing
 down
 the
 Cuban


government.
 You're
 saying
 that
 Rubio


wanted
 to
 ou
 Maduro
 because
 he's
 not
 in


favor
 of
 this
 regime
 obviously,
 but
 also


he
 sees
 this
 as
 a
 way
 of
 weakening
 Cuba.


Frenchie
 had
 told
 us
 that
 Cuba
 had
 come


to
 rely
 on
 Venezuela
 for
 oil.
 And
 so
 by


getting
 control
 of
 Venezuela's
 oil,


Rubio
 thinks
 that
 he
 can
 directly
 impact


the
 Cuban
 regime.


>> That's
 right.
 I
 think
 for
 Rubio,


probably
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 about


what's
 happening
 in
 Venezuela
 right
 now


is
 that
 we
 have
 forced
 Venezuela
 to
 stop


shipping
 oil
 to
 Cuba,


>> right?


>> And
 to
 lose
 such
 a
 key
 nearby
 ally
 and


an
 oil
 supplier
 in
 Venezuela
 is
 a
 major


development
 and
 a
 really
 bad
 one
 for
 the


Cubans.
 On
 top
 of
 that,
 the
 Trump


administration
 is
 pressuring
 other


countries
 to
 not
 step
 in
 and
 come
 to
 the


rescue
 of
 the
 Cubans.
 And
 in
 late


January,
 President
 Trump
 issued
 an


executive
 order
 threatening
 tariffs


against
 any
 country
 that
 supplied
 Cuba


with
 oil.
 So
 now
 we
 have
 already
 seen


another
 major
 blow
 for
 the
 Cuban


government,
 which
 is
 that
 the
 president


of
 Mexico
 has
 said
 that
 she
 has


suspended
 oil
 shipments
 to
 the
 island.


And
 Mexico
 had
 actually
 overtaken


Venezuela
 recently
 as
 the
 island's
 top


supplier.
 So
 that's
 the
 second
 major


supplier
 to
 the
 Cuban
 government
 that


has
 stopped
 sending
 oil
 just
 this
 year.


>> Right.
 It's
 just
 a
 major
 loss
 for
 the


Cuban
 regime.
 And
 having
 covered
 Mexico


as
 the
 bureau
 chief
 there.
 I
 can
 say


that
 the
 president
 Claudia
 Sham
 just
 it


must
 have
 been
 an
 incredibly
 wrenching


moment
 for
 her.
 She's
 a
 leftist.
 She's


the
 daughter
 of
 Marxists.
 I
 mean,
 she


led
 student
 protests
 in
 the
 60s.
 She
 has


been
 an
 outspoken
 supporter
 of
 the
 Cuban


government,
 and
 I
 can
 imagine
 that
 she's


looking
 at
 this
 situation
 where
 she's


really
 between
 a
 rock
 and
 a
 hard
 place.


I
 mean,
 Trump's
 not
 giving
 her
 or
 any


country
 much
 of
 a
 choice
 here.


>> You're
 absolutely
 right.
 But
 I
 think


what
 we're
 seeing
 is
 the
 reality
 today


that
 American
 economic
 might
 coupled


with
 President
 Trump's
 willingness
 to


use
 that
 economic
 power
 in
 ways
 that


other
 presidents
 have
 not.


>> And
 then
 I
 think
 this
 long
 slow
 dimming


of
 the
 glamour
 of
 the
 Cuban
 Revolution


and
 Fidel
 Castro
 and
 the
 impact
 he
 had


on
 people
 around
 Latin
 America.
 I
 think


that
 it's
 probably
 a
 little
 more
 doable


than
 it
 was
 say
 a
 generation
 ago.


>> Right.
 The
 Castros
 are
 no
 longer
 in


power.
 It's
 been
 a
 long
 time
 since
 the


revolution.
 I
 mean,
 things
 have
 changed


on
 the
 island,
 too.
 You're
 right.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 I
 think
 that
 brings
 us
 to
 the


present
 day
 where
 this
 policy
 has
 now


really
 put
 Cuba
 in
 this
 extremely


difficult
 situation
 where
 conditions
 on


the
 ground
 are
 just
 very
 dire,
 no
 oil
 is


coming
 in,
 and
 this
 island
 seems
 close


to
 an
 allout
 humanitarian
 crisis.
 My


question
 is,
 how
 in
 the
 minds
 of
 Marco


Rubio
 and
 President
 Trump
 do
 you
 get


from
 a
 humanitarian
 crisis
 to
 regime


change?
 Like,
 what's
 the
 calculation


there?


>> It's
 not
 easy.
 And,
 you
 know,
 honestly,


it's
 not
 clear
 to
 me
 that
 they
 have
 it


entirely
 figured
 out
 because
 there's


just
 not
 a
 simple
 way
 to
 do
 this.
 You


know,
 it's
 very
 clear
 that
 Rubio
 in


particular
 wants
 to
 see
 this
 regime


brought
 down
 and
 consigned
 to
 the
 dust


bin
 of
 history.
 But
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 I


think
 Rubio
 recognizes
 that
 this
 is
 not


something
 you
 can
 do
 overnight
 for
 a


bunch
 of
 reasons.
 And
 you
 know,
 one
 of


them
 is
 that
 it
 comes
 with
 real
 risks.


I've
 been
 talking
 in
 my
 reporting
 to
 a


lot
 of
 people
 who
 track
 Cuba
 extremely


closely.
 And
 you
 know
 what
 they
 warn
 is


that
 this
 is
 a
 monolithic,
 brittle


political
 system.
 There's
 no
 political


opposition
 because
 the
 government
 there


has
 been
 repressive
 for
 so
 long.
 It's


going
 to
 be
 really
 hard
 to
 find
 some


kind
 of
 a
 opposition
 leader
 who
 could


take
 over
 or
 even
 to
 do
 some
 kind
 of
 a


short-term
 transition
 to
 a
 different


government.
 And
 if
 you
 bring
 down
 the


entire
 government
 without
 something
 to


replace
 it,
 you
 risk
 total
 chaos,


violence,
 mass
 migration
 from
 Cuba


toward
 Florida,
 a
 lot
 of
 conditions
 that


would
 put
 the
 Trump
 administration
 in
 a


very
 uncomfortable
 position
 of
 having
 to


make
 choices
 about
 what
 they
 do
 next.
 So


the
 question
 is,
 is
 there
 a
 way
 that
 you


can
 kind
 of
 engineer
 a
 a
 soft
 landing?


>> What
 would
 that
 look
 like,
 Michael?
 A


soft
 landing.
 I
 am
 wondering
 what
 the


bestcase
 scenario
 the
 Trump


administration
 imagines
 here.
 Like
 are


they
 looking
 to
 find
 a
 partner
 within


the
 Cuban
 regime
 that
 they
 could
 work


with
 to
 kind
 of
 negotiate
 change?


someone
 like
 Deli
 Rodriguez
 in


Venezuela,
 the
 former
 vice
 president
 to


Maduro
 who's
 now
 leading
 the
 country
 and


working
 with
 the
 US.
 Is
 that
 the
 best


case
 here?


>> Well,
 it
 could
 be,
 but
 the
 experts
 that


I
 talked
 to
 say,
 in
 the
 words
 of
 one
 of


them,
 it's
 a
 fool's
 errand
 to
 try
 to


find
 a
 Deli
 Rodriguez
 in
 Cuba.


>> H
 why?
 because
 of
 the
 nature
 of
 their


political
 system.
 Number
 one,
 it's
 very


unlikely
 that
 you
 would
 have
 somebody


who
 was
 willing
 to
 kind
 of
 step
 out
 of


the
 political
 culture
 and
 allow


themselves
 to
 be
 seen
 as
 a
 sort
 of
 a


American
 puppet.
 At
 least
 in
 Venezuela,


you
 have
 a
 substantial
 part
 of
 the


population
 that
 has
 some
 sympathy
 for


the
 United
 States,
 but
 there's
 just


going
 to
 be
 very
 little
 of
 that
 in
 Cuba.


The
 other
 problem
 is
 that
 it's
 a


question
 of
 what
 you
 would
 want
 from
 the


Cubans.
 And
 Rubio
 gave
 an
 interview
 over


the
 weekend
 that
 gave
 us
 some
 clues
 as


to
 what
 they
 might
 be
 thinking.
 And
 he


said
 that
 it's
 really
 important
 that


Cuba's
 government
 agree
 to
 some


significant
 changes
 to
 its
 state-run


socialist
 economy.
 He
 really
 emphasized


the
 economy
 over
 the
 political
 system.


But
 he
 has
 made
 clear
 many
 times
 over


the
 years
 that
 other
 deals
 the
 US
 has


struck
 with
 the
 Cuban
 government,
 which


in
 his
 view
 have
 led
 to
 very
 incremental


reforms,
 were
 almost
 worse
 than
 nothing.


You
 know,
 Rubio's
 reaction
 is
 that


that's
 the
 Cuban
 government
 being


dishonest,
 playing
 for
 time,
 making


promises
 it
 has
 no
 intention
 of
 keeping


and
 eventually
 reneging
 on.
 Well,
 and
 to


be
 fair,
 it's
 true
 that
 this
 regime
 is


absolutely
 expert
 in
 buying
 time.
 That


is
 what
 they
 have
 done
 over
 and
 over


again.
 This
 is
 a
 a
 pattern,
 a


well-established
 pattern.


>> That's
 absolutely
 right.
 So,
 that
 leaves


you
 with
 a
 situation
 where
 it
 looks
 like


the
 Cuban
 government
 would
 have
 to


essentially
 agree
 to
 its
 own
 demise
 to


get
 Trump
 off
 its
 back.
 And
 that
 seems


very
 unlikely.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 basically


suicidal.
 Again,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 talking


to
 many
 people
 who
 have
 followed
 the


Cuban
 leadership
 over
 the
 years
 and
 they


say
 that
 they
 they
 just
 can't
 imagine


that
 happening.
 Now,
 at
 the
 same
 time,


if
 this
 economy
 and
 society
 is
 totally


collapsing
 around
 them
 and
 who
 knows,


maybe
 at
 some
 point
 you
 start
 having


popular
 protests
 that
 could
 convince


them
 to
 make
 a
 deal
 like
 that.
 But


that's
 a
 very
 extreme
 situation.


Michael,
 given
 those
 complications,
 can


we
 actually
 just
 drill
 down
 on
 what


Trump
 wants
 here
 big
 picture?
 It's
 not


as
 if
 Cuba
 has
 a
 ton
 to
 offer
 at
 the


negotiating
 table
 with
 the
 US.


>> We
 know
 for
 Rubio
 this
 is
 personal,
 but


my
 impression
 is
 that
 outside
 of
 the


large
 Cuban-American
 community
 in
 South


Florida,
 not
 many
 Americans
 see
 toppling


the
 Cuban
 regime
 as
 a
 huge
 priority.
 So,


what
 does
 Trump
 care
 about
 here?


>> It's
 a
 great
 question.
 I
 think
 that
 most


of the
 time
 very
 few
 Americans
 are


thinking
 about
 Cuba
 and
 don't
 really


care
 that
 much
 about
 it.
 But
 having
 said


that,
 I
 still
 think
 there's
 little
 doubt


that
 if
 President
 Trump
 were
 to


bring
 down
 the
 communist
 government
 of


Cuba
 implanted
 by
 Fidel
 Castro
 almost
 70


years
 ago


and
 he
 was
 able
 to
 do
 it
 without


destroying
 Cuba
 along
 the
 way.
 I
 really


think
 that
 that
 would
 be
 widely
 regarded


around
 the
 world
 as
 kind
 of
 a
 historic


triumph.
 He
 will
 have
 solved
 a
 foreign


policy
 problem
 that
 many
 presidents


before
 him
 were
 stymied
 by.
 Going
 back


to
 Dwight
 Eisenhower


and
 even
 those
 Americans
 who
 aren't


thinking
 about
 Cuba
 99.99%


of
 the
 time,
 if
 they
 were
 to
 hear
 that


there
 had
 been
 a
 breakthrough,
 that
 the


communist
 government
 was
 stepping
 down


or
 had
 paved
 the
 way
 for
 its
 own


replacement
 in
 some
 credible
 way,
 I


think
 it
 would
 have
 a
 real
 power.


Well,
 Michael,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.


On
 Monday,
 a
 federal
 judge
 ordered
 the


Trump
 administration
 to
 temporarily


restore
 displays
 about
 George


Washington's
 ownership
 of
 enslaved


people
 at
 the
 site
 of
 his
 former
 house


in
 Philadelphia.


Last
 month,
 National
 Park
 Service


workers
 arrived
 at
 the
 site
 and
 took


down
 displays
 and
 video
 exhibits


describing
 the
 nine
 enslaved
 people


Washington
 kept
 there
 while
 he
 was


president.


The
 park
 service
 said
 the
 displays
 were


taken
 down
 to
 ensure
 quote
 accuracy,


honesty,
 and
 alignment
 with
 shared


national
 values.


In
 her
 order,
 the
 judge
 wrote
 that


anyone
 who
 visits
 the
 president's
 house


and
 doesn't
 learn
 about
 founding
 era


slavery
 would
 get
 a
 quote
 false
 account


of
 this
 country's
 history.


And


>> I
 love
 the
 smell
 of
 my
 pum
 in
 the


morning.


>> Smelled
 like


victory.


>> The
 actor
 Robert
 Duval
 died
 on
 Sunday
 at


the
 age
 of
 95.
 He
 was
 known
 for
 a


delightfully
 wide
 range
 of
 leading
 and


supporting
 roles
 from
 a
 principled


cowboy
 to
 a
 mafia
 consigary.


>> Now,
 nobody
 has
 ever
 gone
 down
 a
 New


York
 police
 captain.
 Never.
 It
 would
 be


disastrous.
 All
 the
 five
 families
 would


come
 after
 you,
 Sunny.
 The
 Colony
 family


would
 be
 outcast.
 In
 a
 prolific
 career


spanning
 more
 than
 six
 decades,
 Duval


was
 nominated
 for
 seven
 Academy
 Awards


and
 won
 once.


>> I
 don't
 know
 why
 I
 wandered
 out
 to
 this


part
 of
 Texas
 drunk
 and
 you
 took
 me
 in


and
 pitted
 me
 and
 helped
 me
 to


straighten
 out
 marry
 me.


>> For
 his
 performance
 as
 a
 boozy,
 washed


up
 country
 star
 in
 Tender
 Mercy's.


>> You
 see,
 I
 don't
 trust
 happiness.
 I


never
 did.
 I
 never
 will.
 His
 signature


was
 immersing
 himself
 so
 deeply
 in
 every


role
 that
 he
 almost
 seemed
 to
 become
 his


characters.


To
 prepare
 for
 his
 films,
 he
 spent
 time


with
 police
 detectives,
 hung
 out
 with
 an


ex-convict,
 and
 sang
 with
 a
 country


band.


>> This
 character
 is
 like
 Shakespeare.
 I


think


>> Duvall's
 own
 favorite
 role
 was
 none
 of


his
 major
 big
 screen
 characters.


>> I
 said,
 "Let
 let
 the
 English
 play
 Hamlet


in
 in
 King.
 That's
 wonderful.
 I'll
 play


Augustus
 McCrae."
 I
 mean,
 he's
 like
 a


modern-day
 knight.
 It

 Augustus


McCrae,
