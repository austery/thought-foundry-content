I
 had
 tried
 cursive
 for
 the
 first
 time


and
 what
 I
 was
 able
 to
 create
 just
 blew


me
 away.
 I
 sent
 a
 message
 to
 my
 manager,


my
 manager's
 manager,
 the
 CPO
 and
 then
 a


few
 other
 folks
 that
 I
 knew
 were
 really


interested
 in
 AI
 and
 I
 was
 like,


"Listen,
 I
 had
 this
 really
 profound


experience
 and
 I
 think
 we
 really
 need
 to


uplevel
 the
 skill
 of
 our
 entire
 product


organization,
 not
 just
 designers,
 but


also
 PMs.
 We
 need
 to
 become
 more


familiar
 with
 this
 technology.
 We
 need


to
 understand
 how
 we
 can
 use
 it."
 This


is
 actually
 the
 message
 that
 I
 sent


while
 I
 was
 on
 paternity
 leave
 that


definitely
 got
 my
 leaders
 really
 fired


up.
 I
 didn't
 know
 exactly
 how
 this
 was


going
 to
 go.
 All
 I
 knew
 was
 that
 I


needed
 to
 get
 more
 folks
 paying


attention
 to
 this
 AI
 stuff.


>> If
 you
 were
 the
 first
 to
 raise
 your
 hand


that
 says,
 you
 know
 what,
 I
 want
 to


figure
 out
 how
 our
 team
 can
 use
 AI.
 I'm


going
 to
 lead
 this
 organization.
 It's


such
 a
 unique
 leadership
 opportunity
 to


show
 crossf
 functional
 broad
 impact
 on


teams.


[music]


Welcome
 back
 to
 How
 I
 AI.
 I'm
 Claravo,


product
 leader
 and
 AI
 obsessive
 here
 on


a
 mission
 to
 help
 you
 build
 better
 with


these
 new
 tools.
 Today
 I
 have
 Brian


Greenbomb
 at
 Pendo
 and
 he's
 going
 to


show
 us
 not
 only
 how
 he
 uses
 AI
 in
 his


own
 product
 work,
 but
 his
 step-by-step


plan
 for
 getting
 your
 product
 and
 design


teams
 adopting
 AI
 as
 well.
 Let's
 get
 to


it.
 [music]


This
 podcast
 is
 supported
 by
 Google.
 Hey


everyone,
 Shishta
 here
 from
 Google


DeepMind.
 The
 Gemini
 2.5
 family
 of


models
 is
 now
 generally
 available.
 2.5


Pro,
 our
 most
 advanced
 model,
 is
 great


for
 reasoning
 over
 complex
 tasks.


[music]
 2.5
 Flash
 finds
 the
 sweet
 spot


between
 performance
 and
 price.
 [music]


And
 2.5
 Flash
 Light
 is
 ideal
 for
 low


latency,
 high
 volume
 tasks.

>> Ryan,
 thanks
 for
 joining
 us
 on
 how
 I
 AI.


Happy
 to
 have
 you.


>> Yeah,
 so
 excited
 to
 be
 here.
 Well,
 what


I
 am
 excited
 about
 in
 our
 conversation


is
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 How
 I
 AI
 episodes,


we've
 shown
 specific
 ways
 that
 you
 can


use
 specific
 tools
 to
 build
 or
 do
 things


with
 AI.
 And
 you're
 going
 to
 help
 us


take
 a
 step
 back
 and
 say,
 you
 know,


let's
 say
 you
 have
 all
 these
 tools
 and


you
 want
 to
 start
 using
 them.
 How
 do
 you


get
 a
 full
 team
 or
 a
 full
 organization,


a
 full
 company
 actually
 adopting
 AI?
 And


so
 this
 is
 a
 how
 I
 get
 everybody
 else
 to


use
 AI
 episode.
 So
 I
 would
 love
 to
 start


with
 what
 I
 call
 the
 inception
 phase


which
 we
 all
 have
 gone
 through
 or
 are


all
 in
 the
 process
 of
 trying
 to
 get
 our


team
 to
 go
 through
 which
 is
 when
 you
 get


people
 excited
 and
 sort
 of
 jumpstart
 the


energy
 around
 AI
 and
 I
 think
 you


approach
 this
 in
 a
 really
 interesting


way.
 So
 I'd
 love
 you
 to
 walk
 us
 through


what
 you
 did
 at
 Pendo.


>> Yeah,
 absolutely.
 So
 to
 take
 you
 back,


um
 it's
 the
 end
 of
 last
 year.
 So
 last


July,
 I
 had
 uh
 my
 daughter
 Meer,
 my


daughter
 Maya
 was
 born.
 Um
 you
 can
 kind


of
 see
 the
 nursery
 in
 my
 background
 with


this
 is
 sort
 of
 shared
 office
 uh


nursery.
 Um
 and
 I
 was
 on
 paternity
 leave


at
 the
 end
 of
 last
 year
 and
 I'm
 um
 sort


of
 like
 a
 tech
 geek.
 I've
 been
 following


AI
 for
 a
 while.
 Like
 my
 day
 job
 is
 a


designer
 at
 Pendo,
 but
 you
 know,
 I've


always
 sort
 of
 been
 into
 tech
 and
 so


been
 following
 AI
 very
 closely.
 Um,
 I've


also
 had
 some
 experience
 like
 building


side
 projects
 and
 things
 like
 that.
 And


I
 think
 it
 was
 back
 in
 November,
 cursor


came
 out
 or
 maybe
 it
 was
 a
 little
 bit


earlier
 than
 that,
 but
 cursor
 I
 had


tried
 cursor
 for
 the
 same
 for
 the
 first


time.
 And
 what
 I
 was
 able
 to
 create
 just


blew
 me
 away.
 So
 I
 had
 like
 a
 side


project
 idea,
 this
 hobby
 app
 in
 my
 in
 my


mind
 about
 a
 music
 player
 where
 I
 can
 um


play
 albums
 by
 scanning
 a
 QR
 code
 on
 on


sort
 of
 like
 a
 a
 piece
 of
 paper.
 I
 was


very
 jealous
 of
 people
 who
 had
 record


players.
 don't
 have
 space
 for
 a
 record


player
 in
 New
 York
 and
 they
 get
 to


choose
 music
 by
 sort
 of
 flipping
 through


through
 albums
 and
 uh
 I
 like
 having
 you


know
 unlimited
 access
 to
 to
 music
 via


Spotify
 but
 I
 sort
 of
 miss
 that
 sort
 of


like
 tactile
 um
 experience.
 So
 I
 was


like
 what
 if
 I
 create
 these
 sort
 of
 like


laminated
 cards
 and
 I
 have
 this
 way
 of


just
 being
 able
 to
 play
 the
 albums
 that


are
 on
 that.
 Um
 so
 I
 had
 this
 idea
 of


like
 what
 if
 I
 can
 create
 sort
 of
 a


mobile
 app
 where
 I
 can
 scan
 like
 a
 QR


code
 or
 I
 could
 recognize
 the
 album


cover
 and
 I
 can
 print
 these
 album
 covers


out
 and
 just
 be
 limited
 in
 in
 that
 way.


And
 uh
 I
 I
 had
 no
 idea
 how
 to
 do
 that


like
 on
 my
 own.
 Like
 I'm
 not
 an
 active


developer.
 I
 can't
 sit
 down
 and
 write


that
 application.
 And
 I
 pulled
 up
 cursor


and
 like
 within
 a
 couple
 hours
 I
 had
 a


working
 prototype.
 And
 like
 that
 just


blew
 me
 away.
 I
 was
 creating
 QR
 codes.
 I


was


>> [laughter]


>> uh
 creating
 PDFs.
 I
 was
 like
 doing
 all


this
 like
 really
 really
 really
 cool


stuff.
 And
 um
 you
 know
 like
 I
 said
 my
 my


day
 job
 is
 is
 a
 product
 designer.
 And
 I


immediately
 understood
 that
 like,
 okay,


this
 is
 really
 cool
 as
 a
 sort
 of
 side


project.
 That's
 really
 fun,
 but
 I
 could


use
 this
 to
 build
 interactive


prototypes.
 Um,
 I'm
 I'm
 I
 consider


myself
 pretty
 proficient
 with
 Figma,


especially
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 prototyping,


but
 I
 understand
 the
 limitations
 of


using
 Figma
 for
 prototyping.
 Um,
 a
 lot


of
 what
 I
 do
 at
 Pendo
 is
 sort
 of
 working


on
 features
 that
 are
 analytics
 based.


And
 so,
 when
 you're
 creating
 mock-ups


and
 prototypes
 that
 are
 data
 driven,


it's
 really
 hard
 to
 communicate
 what


the,
 you
 know,
 how
 these
 things
 are


actually
 going
 to
 work
 with
 real
 data.


So
 having
 a
 prototype
 that
 is
 codebased


that
 is
 working
 with
 even
 just
 fake
 data


and
 interacting
 sort
 of
 in
 a
 more


dynamic
 way
 is
 really
 useful.
 So
 I
 was


like
 wow
 I
 we
 could
 really
 use
 this


appendo.
 Um
 so
 I
 had
 the
 you
 know
 even


though
 I
 am
 on
 paternity
 leave
 you
 know


I
 had
 this
 idea
 and
 I
 was
 like
 I


couldn't
 contain
 myself
 you
 know
 I
 had
 I


wasn't
 going
 to
 come
 back
 to
 work
 until


the
 beginning
 of
 January.
 So
 in
 December


um
 I
 wrote
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 folks
 at


Pendo.
 still
 had
 access
 to
 my
 Slack.
 And


so
 I
 wrote,
 you
 know,
 uh
 I
 sent
 a


message
 to
 my
 manager,
 my
 manager's


manager,
 the
 CPO,
 um
 and
 then
 a
 few


other
 folks
 that
 I
 knew
 were
 really,


really
 interested
 in
 AI.
 And
 I
 was
 like,


listen,
 I
 had
 this
 like
 really
 profound


experience.
 And
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 uh
 we


really
 need
 to
 uplevel
 the
 skill
 of
 our


entire
 product
 organization,
 not
 just


designers,
 but
 also
 PMs.
 We
 need
 to


become
 more
 familiar
 with
 this


technology.
 We
 need need
 to
 understand


how
 we
 can
 use
 it.
 I
 had
 already


understood
 that
 like
 there's
 no
 playbook


for
 how
 to
 learn
 this
 stuff.
 There's
 no


class
 you
 can
 take.
 Um
 there's
 no
 book


you
 can
 read.
 And
 the
 technology
 is


evolving
 so
 fast
 that
 the
 only
 way
 to


really
 know
 how
 to
 apply
 it
 is
 to
 become


very
 familiar
 with
 how
 it
 works
 to
 kind


of
 stay
 current
 with
 all
 the
 latest


technologies
 and
 the
 tools
 and
 just
 sort


of
 like
 see
 a
 bunch
 of
 examples
 and
 like


selfishly
 like
 I
 wanted
 to
 spend
 more
 of


my
 time
 at
 work
 doing
 these
 things,
 but


I
 also
 wanted
 to
 um
 help
 my
 my


colleagues
 and
 my
 company
 just
 be
 more


successful
 because
 I
 I
 saw
 a
 clear
 path


to
 that
 and
 just
 getting
 more
 pe
 more
 my


peers,
 more
 of
 my
 colleagues
 like
 doing


the
 same
 thing
 and
 sharing
 their


experiences.
 is
 uh
 I
 know
 would
 help
 me


learn
 and
 I
 think
 it
 would
 just
 sort
 of


like
 you
 know
 uh
 rise
 all
 the
 boats
 and


so
 this
 is
 sort
 of
 an
 example
 here
 not


example
 this
 is
 actually
 the
 message
 I


pulled
 it
 up
 uh
 that
 I
 sent
 while
 I
 was


on
 paternity
 leave
 just
 to
 kind
 of
 give


you
 an
 example
 um
 of
 what
 something
 like


this
 looks
 like
 um
 and
 I
 wrote
 this
 like


pretty
 long
 message
 I
 mean
 for
 folks


that
 are
 um
 not
 watching
 this
 you
 know
 I


just
 kind
 of
 said
 TLDDR
 in
 a
 similar


fashion
 to
 uh
 you
 know
 there's
 an
 and


there's
 an
 engineering
 focused
 uh
 sort


of
 group
 uh
 that
 had
 that
 had
 been


around
 for
 at least
 a
 here
 but
 nothing


really
 focused
 on
 PMs
 and
 designers.
 I


was
 like
 I'd
 like
 to
 lead
 um
 a
 group


like
 that
 uh
 before
 a
 cross
 functional


cross
 functional
 product
 team
 with


design
 designers
 PMs
 and
 etc
 with
 two


goals.
 Um
 Pendo's
 product
 team
 can


leverage
 the
 cutting
 edge
 of
 AI
 tools
 to


get
 more
 done
 in
 fewer
 hours
 and
 less


resources
 improve
 decision-m
 and


communicate
 and
 validate
 ideas
 more


effectively.
 And
 then
 two,
 because
 Pendo


is
 also
 sort
 of
 servicing
 a
 lot
 of


product
 organizations
 that
 are
 going


through
 similar
 transformation
 um
 to


help
 position
 Pendo
 as
 a
 thought
 leader


in
 the
 space
 because
 I
 knew
 it
 was
 going


to
 be
 really
 important.
 And
 then
 I
 went


through
 like
 a
 longer
 version
 of
 sort
 of


like
 my
 my
 experience
 of
 like
 building


this
 app
 and
 um
 and
 why
 I
 thought
 it
 was


important.
 And
 um
 you
 know
 I'm
 really


fortunate
 to
 be
 part
 of
 an
 organization


that
 uh
 supports
 sort
 of
 initiatives


like
 this.
 And
 so
 I,
 you
 know,
 that
 that


definitely
 got
 uh
 my
 my
 leaders
 like


really
 fired
 up.
 In
 fact,
 the
 CPO
 was


like,
 "Hey,
 can
 you
 come
 to
 like
 all


hands
 next
 Monday
 and
 talk
 about
 this


this
 concept?"
 And
 I
 was
 like, "I'm
 on


paternity
 leave.
 I
 can't
 do
 it
 yet."
 Um


uh
 but
 I
 will
 start
 as
 soon
 as
 I
 come


back.
 And
 so
 that
 that's
 sort
 of
 that's


sort
 of
 what
 happened.
 So
 that
 was
 a


catalyst
 for
 uh
 this
 idea.
 And
 I
 gotta


say
 like
 I'm
 I'm
 the
 kind
 of
 person
 that


uh
 you
 know
 sometimes
 I
 can
 be
 like
 type


A
 and
 like
 really
 like
 think
 things


through,
 but
 I
 also
 know
 that
 sort
 of


committing
 to
 something
 or
 just
 like


forcing
 myself
 to
 like
 throw
 myself
 into


a
 situation
 um
 without
 knowing
 like
 how


it's
 going
 to
 work
 out
 uh
 can
 also


result
 in
 something
 really
 interesting.


Um
 so
 I
 didn't
 know
 exactly
 how
 this
 was


going
 to
 go.
 All
 I
 knew
 was
 that
 I


needed
 to
 get
 more
 folks
 paying


attention
 to
 this
 AI
 stuff,
 and
 I
 also


needed
 to
 create
 time
 in
 people's


calendar
 where
 everyone
 could
 just
 like


focus
 on
 it
 and
 play
 or
 maybe
 um
 uh
 like


uh
 hear
 a
 presentation
 on
 on
 something


new.


>> So,
 I
 have
 to
 call
 out
 a
 couple
 things


here
 that
 I
 think
 are
 really
 important.


one
 for
 anybody
 trying
 to,
 you
 know,


give
 a
 a
 a
 justification
 if
 you
 if
 you


need
 it
 for
 investing
 extra
 time,


resources,
 and
 energy
 into
 this
 AI


transformation
 in
 your
 organization.
 I


love
 that
 you
 call
 out
 actually
 the
 two


things
 that
 really
 matter.
 They're
 very


similar
 things
 to
 um
 how
 I
 called
 out


the
 value
 of
 AI
 transformation
 at
 Launch


Darkly,
 which
 was
 one,
 our
 team's
 got
 to


know
 how
 to
 use
 this
 stuff.
 like
 we've


just
 got
 to
 know
 how
 to
 use
 these
 tools,


get
 more
 done,
 be
 more
 efficient,
 just


use
 the
 best
 of
 the
 best.
 The
 second
 one


though
 I
 think
 is
 really
 interesting
 and


there's
 still
 a
 lot
 of
 opportunity
 here.


You
 know,
 you're
 on
 this
 podcast
 which


is
 there's
 this
 opportunity
 for
 leading


organizations
 to
 position
 themselves
 as


thought
 leaders
 in
 how
 you
 get
 stuff


done
 with
 AI
 in
 your
 vertical.
 And
 so


for
 us
 it
 was
 like
 we
 have
 to
 be
 great


AI
 engineers
 because
 we
 need
 to
 you
 know


be
 great
 engineers
 generally.
 This
 is


the
 next
 phase
 of
 how
 software


engineering
 is
 going
 to
 get
 done.
 We


need
 to
 be
 thought
 leaders
 in
 the
 space.


And
 very
 similarly
 for
 you
 on
 the


product
 side.
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 really


important
 that
 you
 can
 create
 platforms


for
 your
 company
 to
 be
 experts
 in
 the


space
 if
 you
 lean
 in
 early
 into
 these


technologies.
 You
 know,
 the
 other
 thing


I
 want
 to
 call
 out
 is,
 you
 know,
 I
 try


to
 tell
 people
 about
 this
 all
 the
 time.


This
 is
 like
 promo
 making
 work.


[clears throat]
 And
 what
 I
 mean
 is
 like


this
 is
 the
 kind
 of
 initiative
 that


doesn't
 come
 around
 that
 often
 as
 an


opportunity.
 And
 if
 you
 are
 the
 first
 to


raise
 your
 hand,
 like
 if
 you
 are
 the


first
 designer
 that
 says,
 you
 know what,


I
 want
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 our
 team
 can


use
 AI.
 I'm
 going
 to
 lead
 this


organization.
 It's
 such
 a
 unique


leadership
 opportunity
 to
 show
 crossf


functional
 broad
 impact
 on
 teams
 and


like
 there's
 only
 gonna
 be
 one
 or
 two
 of


you
 that
 get
 to
 be
 the
 leader
 of
 it.
 So


I'm
 like
 really
 encouraging
 people
 to
 be


like
 you
 raise
 your
 hand
 early
 to
 take


on
 the
 initiative
 for
 the
 organization.


One
 because
 I
 think
 it's
 the
 right
 thing


to
 do
 for
 the
 team,
 but
 two,
 it's
 really


great
 from
 a
 personal
 career


perspective.


>> Absolutely.
 And
 like
 you
 know
 I
 wasn't
 I


wasn't
 going
 to
 focus
 on
 that.
 Um
 but
 I


will
 but
 like
 what
 you're
 saying
 is


absolutely
 100%
 true.
 So
 um
 like


this
 this
 sort
 of
 uh
 initiative
 has


opened
 so
 many
 doors.
 We'll
 get
 into
 it


in
 a
 moment
 but
 it's
 opened
 so
 many


doors
 internally
 within
 the


organization.
 Like
 I'm
 speaking
 with


you.
 There's
 no
 way
 I
 think
 I
 would
 be


speaking
 on
 such
 a
 high-profile
 podcast


if
 I
 didn't
 start
 working
 on
 this
 and


sort
 of
 build
 up
 a
 sort
 of
 the
 the
 body


of
 work
 that
 I
 have
 over
 the
 last
 nine


months.
 Um
 I
 get
 to
 work
 on
 some
 really


cool
 AI
 projects.
 Um,
 I
 have
 folks


throughout
 the
 organization
 that
 are
 not


even
 in
 product
 and
 and
 and
 and
 design,


folks
 I
 didn't
 even
 know
 reaching
 out
 to


me
 and
 sort
 of
 like
 looking
 to
 me
 as
 a


thought
 leader.
 And
 that
 wasn't
 my


intent,
 but
 it's
 absolutely
 true.
 It's


like
 there
 there
 are
 opportunities


across
 um
 all
 organizations
 right
 now


regardless
 of
 your
 level.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 a


senior
 staff
 um
 but
 I'm
 an
 IC.
 I'm
 I'm


just
 a
 product
 designer
 like
 but
 I'm


having
 an
 influence
 way
 beyond
 my
 my


scope.
 And
 I
 think
 uh
 regardless
 of


where
 you
 are
 like
 if
 you
 have
 the


initiative
 and
 the
 energy
 and
 it
 does


take
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 time
 like
 there
 is


some
 nights
 and
 weekends
 that
 like
 I


kind
 of
 put
 into
 it
 but
 I
 also
 love
 this


stuff
 like
 I
 was
 kind
 of
 doing
 it
 anyway


and
 so
 absolutely
 it
 is
 it
 is
 a
 career


builder
 builder.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 you
 know
 maybe
 my
 last


reflection
 is
 do
 you
 know
 how
 many


people
 I
 know
 that
 have
 gone
 on
 parental


leave
 and
 in
 between
 rocking
 their


newborn
 have
 been
 shipping
 stuff
 with


like
 like
 cursor
 like
 every
 single


parent
 I
 know.
 This
 just
 might
 be
 my
 my


peer
 cohort.
 Everyone
 I
 know
 has
 been


texting
 me
 from
 parental
 leave
 being


like,
 "Claire,
 I've
 been
 vibe
 coding


with
 my
 baby
 and
 I
 am
 so
 into
 it."
 So,


if
 you
 have
 uh
 if
 you
 have
 somebody
 on


parental
 leave
 right
 now,
 it's
 very


likely
 they're
 going
 to
 come
 back
 um
 AI


pilled
 for
 sure
 because
 that
 is
 what
 I


have
 seen
 consistently
 with
 with
 some
 of


my
 friends.
 Okay.
 So,
 let's
 actually
 get


into
 this
 message,
 kick
 things
 off,
 but


then
 you
 actually
 have
 to
 functionally


make
 this
 happen.
 and
 you
 sort
 of
 had


like
 a
 two-pronged
 approach
 to
 two


things
 that
 were
 really
 effective
 in


getting
 this
 going
 in
 your
 organization.


So
 what
 were
 those
 two
 things?


>> Yep.
 Yeah.
 Um
 so
 the
 two
 things
 um
 so


I'm
 just
 kind
 of
 bringing
 up
 here
 um
 in


case
 it's
 helpful.
 So
 this
 was
 sort
 of


the
 first
 announcement
 I
 made
 within
 the


organization
 had
 come
 back
 in
 January.


Um
 we
 this
 is
 sort
 of
 like
 our
 private


channel
 of
 the
 entire
 product


organization.
 So
 within
 Pendo
 product


the
 product
 team
 are
 PMs,
 designers,


writers
 um
 and
 a
 few
 other
 folks.
 And
 so


I
 was
 like,
 hey,
 I'm
 starting
 this


initiative.
 And
 um
 in
 my
 mind,
 I
 I
 I
 was


thinking
 that
 there's
 sort
 of
 a


two-prong
 approach.
 There's
 an


asynchronous
 and
 a
 synchronous.
 One


thing
 that
 I
 um
 uh
 was
 very
 familiar


with,
 like
 just
 in
 my
 own
 life,
 but
 also


talking
 to
 other
 people,
 is
 that
 you'll


typically
 hear
 something
 like,
 "Yeah,


that
 AI
 stuff
 like
 I
 know
 it's


important,
 but
 I
 just
 don't
 have
 the


time."
 Like
 I
 don't
 have
 the
 time
 to


like
 watch
 all
 the
 videos
 and
 you
 know,


vibe
 code
 and
 lovable
 or
 whatever
 it
 is,


right?
 And
 the
 crazy
 thing
 is
 like
 if


you
 don't
 make
 the
 time
 for
 it,
 you're


never
 going
 to
 learn
 it
 and
 at
 some


point
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 behind,
 right?


And
 so
 it
 was
 really
 important
 for
 not


just
 there
 to
 be
 a
 place
 within
 Slack


and
 encourage
 people
 to
 share
 on
 Slack


asynchronously
 to
 do
 it
 at
 their
 own


pace,
 but
 also
 to
 create
 time
 in


people's
 calendars
 so
 that
 they
 can
 come


um
 and
 focus
 on
 like
 whatever
 the
 topic


is.
 And
 also
 within
 that
 session,
 it's


not
 just
 about
 a
 presentation.
 It's
 also


like
 it's
 really
 important
 for
 that


presentation
 or
 that
 session
 to
 be


interactive.
 So
 let
 me
 give
 you
 an


example
 of
 that.
 So
 this
 was
 this
 was
 a


this
 was
 a
 kickoff
 as
 well
 as
 an


exercise
 about
 building
 apps.
 Um
 just
 to


sort
 of
 give
 you
 a
 insight
 into
 how
 I


start
 started
 this
 off.
 I
 was
 like
 hey


AI
 is
 getting
 better.
 It's
 getting


faster
 and
 it's
 evolving
 how
 software
 is


planned,
 designed
 and
 built.
 And
 this


was
 really
 meant
 to
 speak
 to
 not
 just
 us


as
 builders
 but
 also
 sort
 of
 the
 the


product
 that
 Pendo
 was
 building.
 And
 uh


right
 around
 that
 time,
 Andrew
 Ing
 had
 a


a
 really
 I
 thought
 thoughtful
 blog
 post


about
 how
 he
 was
 thinking
 about
 how
 uh


PMs
 need
 to
 position
 themselves
 sort
 of


in
 the
 AI
 in
 in
 this
 AI
 future.
 And
 then


AI
 is
 typically
 sort
 of
 in
 the
 space
 of


sort
 of
 engineering
 and
 technical
 stuff


and
 you
 know
 he
 was
 positioning
 AI
 as


perhaps
 being
 uh
 or
 at least
 engineers


being
 better
 positioned
 to
 sort
 of
 like


take
 advantage
 of
 all
 this
 stuff
 because


they
 are
 technical.
 Um
 but
 he's
 saying


it
 was
 really
 important
 for
 PMs
 and
 I


would
 also
 put
 designers
 in
 that
 camp
 as


well
 uh
 to
 become
 proficient.
 And
 so


these
 were
 the
 sort
 of
 five
 things
 that


he
 was
 he
 really
 wanted
 to
 focus
 on


technical
 proficiency
 um
 just
 iterating


on
 the
 development
 like
 using
 AI
 in
 a


sort
 of
 iterative
 capacity
 uh
 being
 very


proficient
 with
 data
 skill
 and
 managing


ambiguity
 and
 then
 ongoing
 learning.
 So


like
 that
 was
 really
 sort
 of
 the


emphasis
 I
 wanted
 to
 drive.
 Um
 and
 so


again
 the
 structure
 of
 sort
 of
 like
 or


at least
 the
 goal
 sorry
 the
 goals
 of
 the


the
 product
 AI
 was
 around
 to
 uh
 uplevel


and
 modernize
 the
 skill
 set
 of
 our
 of


our
 product
 people
 to
 improve
 our


comprehension
 and
 literacy
 and
 then


because
 our
 customers
 are
 also
 builders


to
 empathize
 and
 assist
 with
 them
 as


well.
 And
 I
 wasn't
 sure
 if
 this


technique
 again
 was
 going
 to
 work
 but


this
 was
 how
 I
 was
 thinking
 about


approaching
 it.
 just
 being
 more


hands-on,
 getting
 our
 hands
 dirty,


radical
 many
 to
 many
 sharing,
 being


intentional,
 creating
 the
 space,
 and


then
 identifying
 the
 patterns
 that


worked,
 um,
 and
 then
 sort
 of
 turn
 those


into
 reusable
 patterns.
 So,
 in
 this


opening
 session,
 like
 I
 was
 saying,
 like


it's
 really
 important
 to
 have
 an


interactive
 session.
 And
 I'm
 not
 going


to
 go
 through
 the
 slides
 of
 like
 how
 I


talked
 about
 code
 building
 tools
 and
 the


different,
 you
 know,
 the
 various
 types


and
 some
 things
 that
 I
 had
 built.
 Um,


but
 there
 was
 a
 section
 that
 was
 at


least
 I
 think
 10
 15
 minutes
 where
 I
 was


like,
 "All
 right,
 everyone,
 you
 know,
 go


to
 bolt.new."
 That
 was
 the
 app
 that
 we


chose
 to
 use
 at
 the
 time
 and
 create
 an


account
 if
 you
 haven't
 created
 an


account.
 And
 then
 everyone
 go
 to
 Bolt


and
 copy
 and
 paste
 this.
 So,
 this
 was


just
 a
 prompt
 that
 I
 had
 created.
 Uh,
 it


wasn't
 hyper
 optimized.
 It
 was
 about


creating
 a
 to-do
 list,
 the
 most
 basic


like
 little
 mini
 SAS
 app
 that
 you
 could


possibly
 build.
 And
 I
 had
 everyone
 type


this
 in.
 And
 then
 there
 was
 like
 a


little
 enhanced
 prompt
 thing
 that
 I


wanted
 everyone
 to
 use
 just
 to
 sort
 of


see
 how
 like
 uh
 this
 this
 app
 could
 sort


of
 take
 a
 very
 basic
 thing
 and
 and
 turn


it
 into
 a
 more
 sophisticated
 thing
 and


then
 let
 it
 rip
 and
 hit
 go.
 And
 I
 would


say
 I
 wasn't
 expecting
 this
 when
 I
 did


this
 the
 first
 time,
 but
 the
 thing
 that


really
 stood
 out
 because
 it
 was
 sort
 of


like
 obvious
 to
 me
 that
 this
 is
 this
 is


what
 would
 happen.
 But
 the
 some
 of
 the


feedback
 I
 got
 was
 like
 wow
 like
 we
 all


typed
 in
 the
 same
 thing.
 We
 all
 clicked


on
 the
 enhance
 prompt
 button
 and
 we
 all


got
 different
 results.
 So
 like
 this
 was


just
 sort
 of
 an
 example
 of
 like
 these


were
 all
 the
 to-do
 list
 applications


that
 the
 app
 created
 after
 running
 that


that
 query
 and
 I
 think
 in
 in
 a
 third
 of


the
 cases
 like
 bolt
 just
 came
 back
 and


said
 nope
 like
 like
 like


error
 whatever
 and
 then
 like
 so
 we


immediately
 got
 into
 sort
 of the
 whole


oh
 okay
 don't
 worry
 like
 if
 you
 get
 an


error
 just
 to
 fix
 it
 blah
 blah
 blah
 and


everyone
 sort
 of
 like
 got
 through
 it


after
 two
 or
 three
 rounds.
 So
 that
 is


like
 it
 was
 great
 to
 experience
 that
 as


a
 team
 and
 not
 only
 just
 to
 like
 do
 it


and
 see
 how
 it
 worked
 but
 also
 to
 see


the
 diversity
 of
 like
 how
 like
 these


applications
 um
 are
 built
 and
 how
 Genai


is
 being
 used
 and
 then
 the
 other
 thing
 I


had
 people
 do
 in
 the
 last
 like
 105


minutes
 is
 experiment
 on
 their
 own
 and
 I


told
 people
 just
 to
 do
 crazy
 stuff
 like


we're
 not
 doing
 this
 for
 any
 like
 we're


not
 really
 building
 a
 to-do
 list
 and
 the


AI
 will
 do
 its
 best
 to
 um
 do
 as
 you
 say


so
 you
 can
 give
 it
 like
 the
 most
 wacky


you
 know
 instructions
 right
 like,
 you


know,
 make
 it,
 you
 know,
 add
 a
 retro


8bit
 pixel
 art
 theme,
 you
 know,


introduce
 a
 dark
 mode
 title,
 make
 it


look
 like
 MySpace
 from
 2007.
 And
 so
 that


was
 sort
 of
 like
 an
 interesting
 thing,


too.
 So,
 like
 people
 sort
 of
 like
 went


nuts.
 They
 shared
 some
 things
 like
 I


think
 there's
 a
 few
 examples
 here
 of


like
 people
 saying,
 "Oh,
 you
 know,
 I


tried.
 Yeah,
 here
 here
 this
 is
 what
 UI


will
 look
 like
 in
 20
 uh
 200.


Here's
 my
 Tumblr
 style,
 you
 know,
 to-do


list."
 Um,
 and
 like
 this
 was
 intentional


to
 sort
 of
 like
 make
 it
 fun.
 These
 are


designers,
 but
 there's
 also
 PMs
 and
 like


we
 all
 know
 sort
 of
 like
 the
 there's
 a


line
 between
 sort
 of
 like
 professional


stuff
 and
 personal
 stuff.
 Um,
 but
 like


what
 I
 really
 wanted
 people
 to


experience
 is
 that
 uh
 this
 can
 be
 fun


and
 just
 like
 to
 broaden
 their
 minds


about
 how
 they
 can
 apply
 this


technology.
 One
 thing
 I
 want
 to
 call
 out


as
 a
 meta
 benefit
 to
 this
 slide
 that
 you


showed
 and
 maybe
 we
 could
 go
 back
 to
 it


of
 like
 now
 go
 wild
 or
 or
 optimize
 it
 is


I
 think
 as
 designers
 and
 product


managers
 in
 companies
 and
 you
 can
 tell


me
 if
 you
 have
 a
 different
 experience


but
 we
 have
 just
 gotten
 beaten
 by
 the


scope
 creep
 stick
 so
 frequently
 that
 we


have
 actually
 lost
 our
 muscle
 for
 like


asking
 for
 the
 magic
 thing.
 We
 always


start
 with
 the
 MVP.
 We
 always
 start
 with


like
 what
 is
 the
 bare
 minimum
 thing
 I


can
 ship
 to
 meet
 the
 user
 requirements


that
 I
 know
 engineering
 can
 do
 and
 like


we've
 lost
 this
 ability
 to
 imagine
 like


what
 if
 it
 did
 this
 and
 what
 if
 it
 did


that
 and
 it
 could
 be
 interactive
 or


there
 could
 be
 voice
 and
 what
 I
 like


about
 AI
 is
 one
 it
 makes
 those
 magic


things
 a
 lot
 easier
 to
 build
 you
 know


more
 efficient
 to
 build
 but
 two
 like


it's
 going
 to
 let
 designers
 ers
 and


product
 managers
 return
 to
 the
 craft
 of


building
 the
 awesome
 product
 as
 opposed


to
 like
 the
 viable
 product
 which
 is
 so


like
 if
 you
 reflect
 on
 it
 it's
 so
 sad


that
 we
 have
 put
 on
 a
 pedestal
 like


minimum
 viability
 as
 just
 like
 such
 a


low
 bar
 and
 now
 our
 bar
 can
 just
 be
 so


much
 higher
 for
 what
 we
 build
 but
 you


have
 to
 like
 reignite
 this
 muscle
 of


like
 how
 to
 even
 think
 about
 what
 those


things
 could
 be.
 So,
 I
 love
 the
 idea


that
 you,
 you
 know,
 put
 these


uh
 these
 iterations
 in
 categories
 like


visual
 iterations,
 interactive


iterations,
 entertaining
 or
 gamification


iterations,
 and
 then
 like
 media
 again
 is


something
 that's
 really
 interesting
 that


you
 can
 do
 with
 AI.
 I
 know
 as
 a
 designer


like
 how
 many
 times
 have
 you
 been
 like,


"Oh,
 an
 illustration
 would
 be
 amazing


here,
 but
 no
 one
 wants
 to
 spend
 the
 time


to
 like
 draw
 a
 custom
 icon
 or
 a
 photo


would
 be
 here,
 but
 like
 we
 don't
 have


any
 stock
 photo
 budget
 for
 this
 project,


so
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 like
 erase
 that
 and


put
 whites
 space."
 And
 so
 I
 just
 think


like
 that
 piece
 is
 so
 underrated
 for
 AI


is
 like
 getting
 out
 of
 getting
 us
 out
 of


MVP
 mode.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 got
 actually
 a
 really
 cool


example
 of
 that
 as
 well.
 So
 like,
 you


know,
 that
 was
 the
 sessions,
 right?
 But


then
 there's
 also
 the
 channel
 and
 so
 um


you
 know
 there
 people
 are
 constantly


sharing
 things
 links
 to
 articles


experiments
 that
 they've
 tried.
 I
 mean


that
 was
 the
 whole
 intent
 of
 it
 right
 is


just
 to
 sort
 of
 have
 a
 space
 where


people
 can
 share
 things
 and
 I
 think


there's
 an
 example
 in
 here
 where
 ah
 yes


here
 it
 So
 Mark,
 you
 a
 he's
 a
 a
 product


designer
 and
 I
 think
 this
 was
 right


around
 the
 time
 that
 Midjourney
 um


launched
 the
 ability
 to
 do
 animations
 or


video
 and
 he
 was
 like,
 "Wouldn't
 it
 be


cool
 to
 have,
 you
 know,
 sort
 of
 in
 this


intro
 screen
 these
 little
 animated


characters
 that
 sit
 there
 and
 just
 like


wave
 at
 you,
 right?"


>> And
 it's
 so
 cute.


>> Exactly.
 Right.
 [laughter]


>> And
 that
 it
 wasn't
 that
 hard.
 I
 mean,


like
 I
 think
 he,
 you
 know,
 he
 iterated


on
 a
 couple
 of
 problems
 like
 this,
 this


is
 not
 in
 the
 product.
 It's
 not
 in
 the


product
 yet,
 but
 I
 mean,
 he
 was
 able
 to


create
 an
 asset
 that
 not
 that
 hard
 to


drop
 in
 if
 you
 have
 the
 right
 spot
 for


it.
 Um,
 and
 like
 like
 you
 said
 before,


it
 was,
 oh
 man,
 like
 really
 cool
 to
 have


like
 an
 illustration
 or
 an
 animation,


but
 I
 got
 to
 go
 talk
 to
 a
 professional


or
 I
 got
 to
 go
 spend
 like
 nights
 and


weekends
 working
 on
 it.
 It's
 like
 not


worth
 the
 effort.
 And
 now
 we
 can
 bring
 a


little
 more
 life
 into
 our
 applications.


>> And
 that
 life
 of
 course
 turns
 into
 like


what
 I
 just
 did,
 which
 is
 like,
 oh
 my


god,
 I
 love
 it.
 Which
 is
 just
 like


customer
 connection
 to
 your
 brand,
 to


your
 product.
 um
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 sense


of
 like
 this
 team
 actually
 really
 cares


about
 the
 craft
 and
 is
 going
 to
 continue


to
 invest
 in
 this
 product
 experience
 all


that
 all
 the
 great
 stuff
 and
 then
 I
 I


just
 want
 to
 call
 out
 for
 folks
 that


maybe
 missed
 this
 in
 part
 of
 the


transition.
 So
 the
 two
 kind
 of
 major


pieces
 you
 put
 in
 were
 these
 sessions,


these
 product
 and
 AI
 sessions,
 and
 you


showed
 us
 the
 kickoff
 deck
 of
 what
 that


looked
 like,
 both
 the
 why
 and
 then
 like


let's
 actually
 get
 into
 it.
 Let's
 do
 it


together.
 And
 then
 the
 second
 piece,


that's
 the
 sync
 piece.
 Um,
 and
 you
 do


those
 weekly,
 right?
 Or
 just


>> we
 do
 them
 bi-weekly.
 I
 mean,
 we
 could


probably
 do
 them
 weekly,
 but
 we've
 we've


done
 them
 bi-weekly.


>> Yeah.
 I
 um
 I
 I
 I
 put
 in
 a
 we
 put
 in
 a


similar
 thing.
 um
 we
 called
 them
 like
 AI


power
 hours
 on
 Friday
 and
 it
 was
 like


every
 week
 we
 we
 would
 do
 that.
 And
 then


the
 second
 thing
 is
 the
 async
 channel


which
 like
 if
 you
 do
 not
 have
 it
 you


should
 definitely
 have
 it
 where
 folks


are
 just
 sharing
 and
 I
 like
 this
 bullet


point
 that
 you
 had
 in
 your
 slide
 that


was
 like
 radical
 peer-to-peer
 share.
 I


forget
 what
 it
 said
 but
 it
 was
 such
 a


good
 phrase.
 Yeah.
 Radical
 many
 to
 many


sharing.
 And
 so
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I


think
 organizations


often
 suffer
 from
 during
 this
 AI


transformation
 is
 information
 hoarding


and
 like
 secret
 AI.
 And
 I
 think
 it


happens
 for
 two
 reasons.
 Secret
 AI
 can


happen
 because
 people
 aren't
 sure
 what


they
 can
 use
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 talk


about
 that
 in
 a
 minute.
 And
 so
 they
 like


kind
 of
 pretend
 they're
 not
 using
 AI
 or


they
 use
 their
 like
 Gmail
 account,
 Gmail


chat
 GBT
 account
 because
 they
 don't
 want


to
 get
 in
 trouble
 but
 they're
 going
 to


use
 it
 anyway.
 And
 so
 there's
 like


secrecy
 because
 people
 don't
 know
 the


golden
 path
 of
 using
 AI.
 And
 then


there's
 like
 information
 and
 skills


hoarding
 right
 now,
 which
 is
 like
 the


dark
 side
 of
 being
 an
 AI
 agent
 or
 an
 AI


change
 agent,
 which
 is
 people
 are
 like,


well,
 I'm
 the
 only
 one
 that
 knows
 how
 to


do
 this.
 So
 I'm
 going
 to
 stand
 out
 if


I'm
 like
 extra
 good
 uh
 on
 these
 things


or
 just
 get
 my
 work
 done
 faster
 or


whatever.
 And
 so
 this
 like
 build
 in


public
 many
 to
 many
 sharing
 is
 so


important
 for
 a
 healthy
 culture
 around


AI
 transformation.
 I
 cannot
 emphasize


this
 this
 one
 enough.


>> Absolutely.


>> This
 episode
 is
 brought
 to
 you
 by


Lovable.
 If
 you've
 ever
 had
 an
 idea
 for


an
 [music]
 app
 but
 didn't
 know
 where
 to


start,
 Lovable
 is
 for
 you.
 Lovable
 lets


you
 build
 working
 apps
 and
 websites
 by


simply
 chatting
 with
 AI.
 [music]
 Then


you
 can
 customize
 it,
 add
 automations,


and
 deploy
 it
 to
 a
 live
 domain.
 It's


perfect
 for
 marketers
 spinning
 up
 tools,


product
 managers
 prototyping
 new
 ideas,


or
 founders
 [music]
 launching
 their
 next


business.
 Unlike
 no
 code
 tools,
 Lovable


isn't
 about
 static
 pages.
 It
 [music]


builds
 full
 apps
 with
 real


functionality.
 And
 it's
 fast.
 What
 used


to
 take
 weeks,
 months,
 or
 even
 years,


you
 can
 now
 do
 over
 the
 weekend.
 So,
 if


you've
 been
 sitting
 on
 an
 idea,
 now's


the
 time
 to
 bring
 it
 to
 life.
 [music]


Get
 started
 for
 free
 at
 lovable.dev.


That's
 lovable.dev.


You
 implemented
 this
 back
 in
 January,


back
 from
 from
 uh
 leave.
 We're
 can
 you


believe
 it?
 The
 year
 is
 like
 almost


over.
 We're
 like
 we're
 like
 there.
 It's


unbelievable.


>> I
 know.


>> Um
 and
 and
 you
 know,
 how
 did
 you


actually
 measure?
 Did
 any
 of
 this


matter,
 right?
 Like
 did
 we
 do
 this
 and


was
 it
 fun
 and
 or
 did
 people
 actually


adopt
 this
 and
 how
 did
 you
 how
 did
 you


get
 there?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 um
 I
 think
 there's
 like


there's
 several
 ways
 I
 can
 answer
 that


question.
 The
 first
 is
 like,
 you
 know,
 I


>> I
 didn't
 intend
 to
 have
 to
 implement
 a


companywide
 transformation,
 right?
 Like


I
 I
 needed
 to
 start
 uh
 somewhere
 or
 at


least
 I
 wanted
 to
 really
 focus
 on
 my


craft
 and
 the
 people
 that
 are
 around
 me.


So
 that
 was
 product
 design,
 a
 little
 bit


of
 engineering,
 right?
 And
 so
 product
 AI


is
 intentionally
 focused
 on
 the
 area


around
 creating
 products
 um
 using
 AI
 to


um
 do
 design,
 product
 management,


engineering,
 that
 sort
 of
 thing.
 It


wasn't
 intended
 to
 sort
 of
 like
 branch


out
 to
 you
 know
 how
 does
 revenue
 sell


better
 or
 how
 does
 finance
 do
 whatever


finance
 does
 better
 right?
 Um
 the


channel
 so
 like
 it
 really
 it
 was
 really


important
 for
 the
 channel
 to
 be
 public.


We
 have
 like
 200
 plus
 people
 on
 the


channel
 now.
 That
 is
 way
 more
 than
 the


product
 organization.
 So
 the
 thing
 is


like
 even
 if
 you're
 sort
 of
 focusing
 on


a
 functional
 area
 um
 there's
 aspects
 of


that
 functional
 area
 that
 bleeds
 outside


of
 the
 organization.
 Um
 so
 just
 to
 kind


of
 give
 you
 a
 perspective
 on
 like
 the


sessions
 that
 we
 ran
 right
 so
 we
 started


back
 in
 January
 we
 were
 doing
 it
 every


two
 weeks
 and
 you
 can
 kind
 of
 see
 sort


of
 like
 some
 of
 the
 the
 different


topics.
 It
 wasn't
 just
 all
 about
 vibe


coding.
 It's
 about
 prompting.
 It's
 about


you
 know
 how
 do
 you
 take
 customer


feedback
 and
 sort
 of
 make
 sense
 of
 it.


Um
 there's
 sessions
 here
 on
 just
 like


diving
 into
 just
 Gemini.
 I
 mean
 like
 we


have
 access
 to
 all
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of


Google
 features
 from
 Google
 that
 are
 AI


related
 and
 they're
 spread
 out


throughout
 their
 entire
 ecosystem.
 So


it's
 like
 hey
 what's
 what
 are
 all
 the


things
 that
 we
 can
 do
 to
 sort
 of
 take


advantage
 of
 that
 and
 that
 was
 one
 where


I
 intentionally
 made
 it
 not
 just
 about


product
 and
 design
 because
 like
 you
 know


the
 the
 finance
 people
 and
 the
 revenue


people
 could
 definitely
 take
 advantage


of
 things
 like
 deep
 research
 within


Gemini
 or
 the
 AI
 function
 within
 within


uh
 sheets.
 So
 sometimes
 like
 it
 makes


sense
 to
 sort
 of
 like
 really
 promote


these
 things
 outside
 but
 again
 it
 was


like
 you
 know
 you
 kind
 of
 want
 to
 make


sure
 that
 you
 stay
 within
 your
 group.


And
 then
 separately
 there
 was
 an


initiative
 uh
 an
 OKR
 in
 the
 first


quarter
 of
 of
 this
 year.
 Our
 quarters


begin
 in
 February.
 So
 I
 had
 started


this.
 Yeah.
 What's
 it's
 so
 weird


enterprise
 enterprise
 sales
 uh
 fiscal


year
 right
 there.
 [laughter]


>> Yeah.
 It
 it it
 really
 confuses
 me


because
 like
 we're
 in
 fiscal
 year
 2026.


Like
 I
 thought
 still


>> 2022
 and
 it's
 October.
 What's
 happening?


>> Yeah,
 totally.
 Um
 so
 yeah,
 we're
 like
 a


little
 like
 one
 month
 off.
 So
 our


quarters
 begin
 in
 in
 uh
 in
 February.
 So


I
 had
 started
 this
 and
 I
 think
 because


you
 know
 to
 your
 to
 your
 point
 earlier


about
 like
 how
 this
 this
 uh
 is
 also
 a


good
 career
 move.
 It
 adds
 a
 lot
 of


visibility
 I
 think
 to
 you
 if
 you
 sort
 of


take
 the
 initiative.
 Like
 I
 had
 just


started
 this
 a
 couple
 weeks
 earlier,
 but


I
 was
 invited
 to
 be
 part
 of
 a
 crossf


functional
 group
 that
 was
 responsible


for
 a
 companywide
 OKR
 to
 improve
 um
 um


AI
 AI
 leverage
 within
 the
 organization.


And
 so
 um
 I
 can
 show
 you
 some
 of
 the


things
 that
 we
 did
 but
 like
 I
 think
 the


most
 important
 thing
 uh
 that
 we
 did
 was


just
 measuring
 right
 just
 measuring
 sort


of
 like
 what
 is
 the
 and
 we
 called
 it
 a


sentiment
 survey
 because
 like
 we
 didn't


really
 know
 what
 people's
 or
 like
 my


colleagues
 uh
 feelings
 were
 about
 AI


right
 like
 because
 you
 know
 you
 might


feel
 like
 AI
 is
 taking
 your
 job
 or
 AI
 is


creating
 slob
 or
 you
 might
 feel
 that


like
 AI
 is
 such
 like
 a
 cool
 fun
 like


incredibly
 transformational
 technology


that
 you
 know
 is
 gonna
 solve
 cancer,


right?
 Like
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 the


sentiment
 is.
 We
 weren't
 really,
 you


know,
 you're
 not
 h
 you
 were
 never
 really


hiring
 for
 the
 skill
 or
 this
 attitude,


right?
 And
 so
 you
 have
 a
 group
 of
 folks


and
 you
 know
 you're
 thinking
 about


instituting
 a
 transformation
 on
 how
 they


work
 and
 the
 technology
 they
 use.
 And
 so


it
 was
 really
 important
 I
 think
 for
 us


to
 get
 a
 temperature
 read
 on
 like
 how


people
 felt
 about
 AI.
 But
 we
 also
 wanted


to
 know
 other
 dimensions
 as
 well.
 Are


they
 aware
 of
 the
 like
 for
 instance
 are


they
 familiar
 with
 our
 usage
 policy?


Right?


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 shadow
 IT
 happening


just
 like
 you
 said
 like
 people
 are
 using


their
 Gmail
 their
 personal
 chat
 GBT


accounts
 to
 do
 professional
 work
 and


they're
 not
 sure
 is
 like
 is
 that


cheating?
 Is
 that
 allowed?
 Um
 or
 even


like
 what
 kind
 of
 data
 am
 I
 allowed
 to


put
 into
 chat
 GBT?
 Can
 I
 put
 like


customer
 transcripts
 in
 there?
 Like
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 know what
 the
 answer
 is.


And
 some
 people
 are
 just
 doing
 it


because
 they
 know
 it's
 going
 to
 be


helpful
 and
 some
 people
 are
 not
 doing
 it


because
 they're
 worried
 that
 you
 know


that's
 not
 that's
 not
 cool.
 Um,
 and
 the


other
 thing
 too
 is
 like
 they
 don't
 know


what
 tools
 are
 available
 because
 yeah,
 I


mean
 like
 you
 have
 Salesforce,
 you
 have


Gmail,
 but
 you
 don't
 like
 we
 at
 the


point
 at
 that
 time
 we
 didn't
 have


companywide
 licenses
 for
 chat
 GBT,


right?
 So
 like
 no
 one
 knows
 what
 what
 is


actually
 available
 to
 them.
 Um,
 and
 so


what
 I'm
 showing
 here
 is
 like
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 quarter.
 So
 like
 the


idea
 was
 we
 would
 do
 some
 things
 within


the
 quarter,
 but
 in
 the
 beginning
 of
 the


quarter
 we
 take
 this
 baseline
 and
 we


asked
 these
 five
 questions
 and
 we
 also


got
 some
 uh
 some
 qual
 feedback
 as
 well.


So
 it
 kind
 of
 gave
 us
 a
 little
 um
 an


idea
 sort
 of
 like
 you
 know
 why
 things


were
 trending
 in
 a
 certain
 way.
 Um
 and


then
 one
 thing
 that
 we
 we
 we
 noticed
 and


you're
 kind
 of
 looking
 at
 sort
 of
 like


the
 trend
 of
 what
 happened
 be
 from
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 quarter
 to
 the
 end
 of


the
 quarter.
 Uh
 there
 was
 an
 increase


along
 all
 of
 these
 measurements
 and
 the


biggest
 ones
 were
 around
 this
 uh
 usage


policy
 and
 which
 tools
 do
 I
 have


available
 to
 me.
 I
 think
 the
 biggest
 gap


was
 here
 because
 we
 didn't
 spend
 any


time
 with
 it.
 So
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 work


done
 in
 that
 quarter
 um
 just
 by
 making


people
 aware
 of
 what
 they
 can
 do
 and
 how


they
 can
 request
 software.
 So
 here's
 a


just
 a
 screenshot
 of
 an
 internal
 uh
 uh


confluence
 document
 we
 call
 the
 AI


knowledge
 center.
 And
 in
 this
 document


um
 is
 all
 the
 information
 that
 an


employee
 needs
 to
 know
 about
 which
 AI


tools
 they
 have
 available
 to
 them.
 So,


like
 if
 you
 were
 to
 scroll
 down,
 you'd


get
 this
 like
 alphabetized
 table
 of
 all


the
 products
 that
 have
 been
 approved
 to


be
 used
 within
 our
 organization
 for


security
 reasons,
 um,
 for
 for
 legal


reasons.
 I
 mean,
 the
 the
 thing
 is
 that


like
 AI
 is
 a
 is
 a
 vector
 for
 doing
 some


really
 bad
 stuff.
 And
 even
 though
 you


want
 to
 move
 fast
 and
 you
 want
 to
 use


all
 of
 these
 really
 cool
 tools,
 you


don't
 want
 to
 put
 your
 company
 and
 your


customers
 data
 at
 risk.
 And
 so
 it's


really
 important
 that
 you
 know
 you
 work


closely
 with
 your
 security,
 your
 IT


department,
 your
 finance
 department,


your
 legal
 department.
 And
 like
 again
 I


was
 very
 fortunate
 in
 to
 be
 in
 an


organization
 where
 like
 those
 folks


which
 sometimes
 can
 feel
 like
 friction


and
 a
 barrier
 like
 they
 um
 I
 think
 they


recognize
 that
 like
 this
 was
 also
 really


important
 and
 sort
 of
 like
 prioritized


um
 you
 know
 still
 doing
 all
 the
 the


solid
 work
 but
 like
 adding
 uh
 I


prioritize
 sort
 of
 like
 the
 enabling
 us


to
 sort
 of
 like
 not
 just
 use
 these
 tools


but
 experiment
 with
 different
 ones.
 like


I
 found
 myself
 for
 like
 a
 month
 like


every
 week
 I
 was
 submitting
 these
 like


zip
 requests
 for
 new
 software
 that
 I


wanted
 to
 to
 try
 out.
 Um
 and
 it
 would


only
 take
 maybe
 like
 a
 week
 for
 me
 to


sort
 of
 get
 the
 the
 okay
 and
 you
 can


kind
 of
 see
 like
 it
 was
 really
 important


not
 just
 to
 see
 which
 applications
 I
 had


access
 to
 and
 how
 how
 that
 application


could
 be
 used
 but
 what
 kind
 of
 data
 can


I
 share
 within
 an
 application
 as
 well
 as


if
 I
 want
 to
 get
 access
 to
 it
 like
 what


are
 ways
 that
 I
 can
 I
 can
 get
 to
 that.


And
 so
 when
 I
 you
 know
 I
 go
 back
 to
 this


slide
 you
 know
 that
 was
 that
 was
 one
 of


the
 the
 the
 tactical
 things
 we're
 able


to
 get
 done
 in
 a
 single
 quarter
 that


really
 made
 a
 huge
 difference
 sort
 of
 in


this
 um
 in
 this
 metric
 of
 awareness


about
 policy
 and
 tools.


>> I
 want
 to
 just
 call
 this
 out
 for
 the


leaders
 on
 the
 team
 that
 are
 or
 the


leaders
 in
 the
 audience
 that
 are


listening.
 This
 is
 the
 first
 thing
 I


tell
 them
 to
 do
 is
 I
 say
 define
 the


golden
 path
 to
 using
 AI
 and
 it
 takes


three
 pieces.
 It
 takes
 finance
 and


procurement.
 It
 takes
 legal
 and
 it
 takes


security.
 And
 what
 I
 tell
 them
 is
 it's


really
 not
 going
 to
 benefit
 the


acceleration
 of
 your
 team
 to
 say
 we'll


go
 heads
 down
 and
 figure
 out
 how
 you
 can


get
 chat
 GBT
 and
 cursor
 and
 you'll
 get


your
 three
 little
 little
 tools
 and
 we'll


let
 you
 know
 what
 they
 are.
 You
 actually


need
 what
 you
 called
 out
 which
 is
 a
 very


fast
 path
 to
 experimenting
 with


reasonable
 tools
 to
 identify
 which
 ones


are
 going
 to
 work
 for
 your
 team.
 And


that
 rapid
 experimentation
 is
 really


really
 important.
 You
 can't
 go
 do
 a
 big


like
 multi-month
 evaluation
 of
 one
 code


editing
 tool
 because
 as
 you
 said
 they're


changing
 so
 rapidly.
 And
 so
 I
 love
 this


documented
 place
 of
 like
 here's
 the


tool,
 here's
 the
 status,
 here's
 the
 data


you
 can
 put
 in
 and
 the
 data
 you
 can't


put
 in.
 Here's
 how
 you
 get
 a
 license.


Here's
 how
 you
 get
 help.
 Um
 is
 just
 very


very
 very
 useful.
 and
 and
 if
 you
 can
 get


this
 done,
 then
 it
 all
 starts
 to


snowball
 from
 there
 because
 people
 have


a
 place
 and
 a
 path
 to
 go
 down.
 So,
 I


this
 is
 probably
 like
 not
 the
 most


exciting
 screen
 share
 we've
 seen.
 Like,


it's
 a
 it's
 a
 table
 and
 a
 confluence


talk,
 but
 like
 I
 just
 want
 everybody
 to


pause,
 screenshot
 this
 if
 you
 do
 not


have
 this
 in
 your
 org.
 Like,
 you
 need


it.
 Need
 it
 today
 because
 this
 is
 going


to
 be
 the
 thing
 that
 changes
 how
 you


work.
 I
 love
 this.


>> Yeah,
 100%.
 Um,
 and
 like
 once
 you
 kind


of
 get
 that
 ball
 rolling,
 like
 you
 know,


there
 there's
 a
 separate
 channel
 too,


like
 I
 think
 it's
 called
 like
 the
 AI


knowledge
 center.
 It's
 meant
 to
 be
 sort


of
 like
 the
 product
 AI
 channel
 but
 more


like
 broad-based.
 And
 every
 once
 in
 a


while,
 someone
 be
 like,
 "Hey,
 can
 I
 use


granola
 for
 this?"
 And
 someone
 outside


of
 it,
 you
 know,
 someone
 who's
 just


familiar
 with
 this
 with
 this
 process


would
 just
 like,
 "Hey,
 yeah,
 go
 check


out
 the
 thing.
 You
 know,
 yeah,
 you
 can


use
 it,
 but
 you
 have
 to
 get
 approval,


yada
 yada
 yada."
 And
 so
 like
 once
 you


sort
 of
 get
 the
 ball
 rolling,
 you
 have


really
 good
 documentation,
 you
 just
 sort


of
 reemphasize
 this
 is
 where
 you
 go,


this
 is
 the
 process.
 And
 on
 the
 on
 the


flip
 side,
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 not
 in
 legal,


security,
 IT,
 that
 sort
 of
 thing.
 But


like
 when
 that
 those
 groups
 um
 that
 that


group
 those
 groups
 are
 responsive
 to
 an


organization
 that
 wants
 to
 experiment


and
 try
 this
 stuff,
 then
 that
 the
 the


flywheel
 just
 just
 keeps
 going.
 And
 um


you
 know
 like
 I
 said
 in
 the
 beginning
 of


the
 year
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 like


confusion
 about
 what
 I
 can
 do
 and


whatever
 and
 now
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 it's
 all


gone
 but
 like
 it
 is
 nowhere
 near
 the
 top


list
 the
 top
 of
 our
 list
 of
 things
 that


like
 we
 are
 concerned
 about
 when
 it


comes
 to
 AI
 transformation.
 Well,
 I
 love


this.
 You
 know,
 just
 to
 recap,
 you've


shown
 us
 how
 you
 become
 a
 change
 agent.


You
 know,
 sort
 of
 incept
 your


organization
 into
 taking
 this
 seriously


as
 an
 initiative,
 how
 you
 use


synchronous
 meetings
 and
 asynchronous


Slack
 channels
 to
 drive
 this
 as
 a


consistent
 practice
 over
 time.
 And
 then


you
 use
 OKRs
 to
 actually
 measure
 does


any
 of
 this
 matter?
 And
 you're
 showing


that
 like
 if
 you
 put
 these
 simple
 things


in
 place,
 you
 can
 actually
 inlect
 those


measures
 which
 you
 know
 just
 in
 the


looking
 at
 the
 sentiment.
 Um,
 I
 like


that
 last
 question
 that
 you
 had
 on
 the


sentiment
 survey
 which
 is
 like
 I
 think


this
 is
 going
 to
 have
 a
 positive
 impact


on
 our
 employees
 and
 that
 went
 up
 and


that
 is
 a
 huge
 win
 for
 for
 a
 company


because
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 feeling
 fear


about
 their
 careers,
 uncertainty,
 doubt


and
 so
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 can
 show
 you


can
 do
 these
 very
 simple
 things
 and


inflect
 that
 sentiment
 very
 positively


in
 your
 employee
 population
 is
 also


fabulous.
 So,
 uh,
 Brian,
 this
 was
 great.


Thank
 you
 for
 showing
 us
 again
 like
 I


could
 not
 write
 a
 better
 playbook
 for


getting
 AI
 adoption
 in
 a
 team.
 This
 is


what
 I've
 done.
 I
 you
 it
 works.
 Let's
 do


this.
 Let's
 repeat
 this
 and
 stamp
 it
 out


in
 our
 our
 own
 teams.
 So
 let's
 get
 to


some
 lightning
 round
 questions
 and
 then


we'll
 get
 you
 back
 to
 all
 your
 fun
 AI


projects.
 The
 first
 question
 I
 have
 is


okay.
 You
 showed
 us
 like
 you're


incepting
 people
 and
 you're
 you
 know


managing
 your
 stakeholders
 and
 all
 that


kind
 of
 stuff.
 What
 is
 your
 favorite


thing
 you've
 built
 with
 AI
 over
 the
 last


year
 for
 for
 work?
 I've
 built
 a
 lot
 of


really
 cool
 things.
 Um,
 the
 one
 that
 I'm


most
 proud
 of,
 but
 it's
 it's
 kind
 of


geeky
 is
 that
 I
 built
 my
 own
 MCP
 server


for
 Pento.
 Um,
 so,
 uh,
 back
 maybe
 back


in
 the
 spring
 whenever
 when
 MCP
 was


becoming
 really
 hot,
 uh,
 folks
 have
 been


talking
 about
 MCP
 and
 like
 how
 it
 could


be
 applied
 to
 to
 Pendo.
 And
 um
 what
 I


clearly
 saw
 was
 after
 using
 tools
 like


deep
 research
 that
 is
 essentially
 like


an
 agent
 that
 can
 you
 know
 basically
 run


a
 bunch
 of
 web
 queries
 over
 and
 over
 and


over
 again
 to
 sort
 of
 build
 up
 sort
 of
 a


a
 research
 document.
 I
 had
 spent
 you


know
 I've
 been
 in
 in
 tech
 for
 a
 while.
 I


I'm
 a
 designer
 now
 but
 I've
 also
 spent


time
 as
 a
 PM
 and
 I've
 done
 a
 lot
 of


growth
 work.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


is
 common
 within
 growth
 is
 you're
 you're


constantly
 moni
 monitoring
 like


dashboards
 of
 conversion
 rates
 and


retention
 and
 blah
 blah
 blah.
 And
 every


once
 in
 a
 while
 a
 number
 will
 like
 dip


or
 will
 dive,
 right?
 And
 then
 you're


you're
 off
 and
 you're
 spending
 like
 the


entire
 week
 trying
 to
 understand
 like


what
 is
 it
 like?
 Do
 we
 have
 like
 an


issue?
 Do
 we
 have
 a
 bug?
 Like
 is
 there


something
 going
 on,
 you
 know,
 in
 one
 of


our
 regions?
 uh
 you
 know
 like
 if
 you're


doing
 a
 year-over-year
 comparison
 like


maybe
 a
 holiday
 fell
 you
 know
 last
 year


and
 not
 this
 year
 and
 so
 like
 that's
 why


these
 and
 usually
 it's
 it's
 like
 some


common
 sense
 thing
 but
 like
 if
 someone


above
 you
 sort
 of
 sees
 this
 and
 they're


just
 like
 wait
 a
 minute
 like
 fire
 drill


like
 we
 got
 to
 go
 figure
 it
 all
 out
 and


that
 like
 just
 eats
 up
 your
 whole
 week


doing
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 iterative


research
 right
 looking
 at
 the
 data
 from


different
 angles
 and
 I'm
 like
 this
 could


be
 like
 like
 a
 deep
 research
 like
 query


but
 having
 access
 to
 like
 our
 data
 right


um
 or
 usage
 data
 could
 be
 uh
 like
 a


killer
 and
 like
 NCP
 is
 a
 technology
 that


can
 leverage
 that
 if
 I
 can
 give
 the
 AI


tools
 to
 run
 these
 queries
 and
 then
 like


use
 its
 intelligence
 to
 like
 look
 at
 the


data
 and
 be
 like
 oh
 what
 about
 looking


at
 it
 by
 region
 let's
 look
 at
 it
 a
 year


let's
 look
 at
 it
 blah
 blah
 blah
 um
 and


so
 that
 was
 sort
 of
 like
 the
 idea
 that
 I


had
 of
 connecting
 like
 okay
 how
 this
 is


how
 MCP
 could
 be
 useful
 um
 for
 our


customers
 right
 because
 we
 also
 we're
 a


product
 analytics
 um
 provider
 and
 so
 I


had
 this
 conversation
 with
 my
 colleague


colleagues
 and
 they're
 just
 like
 I
 don't


know
 if
 you
 know
 because
 we
 have
 like
 a


a
 bespoke
 quering
 language.
 It's
 not


SQL,
 so
 it
 it
 takes,
 you
 know,
 the
 AI


doesn't
 know
 how
 to
 write
 those
 queries,


but
 I
 I
 thought
 I
 had
 a
 way
 of
 doing
 it


that
 that
 could
 sort
 of
 overcome
 that.


And
 so
 over
 a
 couple
 of
 nights,
 um
 I


basically
 just
 leveraged
 the
 MCP


documentation
 giving
 it
 to
 cursor.
 I


have
 no
 idea
 how
 my
 I
 built
 an
 MTP


server.
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 actually
 how
 it


works,
 but
 I
 understand
 like
 right.
 It's


like
 a
 lot
 of


>> I'm
 laughing.
 I'm
 laughing.
 Everybody


close
 your
 ears.
 I
 legitimately


approached
 MCP
 servers
 as
 true
 sorcery


sorcery


before
 I
 built
 one.
 I
 was
 so
 I
 don't


there's
 there's
 some
 branding
 issue
 that


that
 the
 MCP
 platform
 and
 framework
 has


because
 it
 seems
 like
 sorcery.
 So
 I
 was


with
 you
 until
 I
 actually
 built
 one
 and


like
 you
 know
 wrote
 the
 code
 and
 then
 I


was
 like
 oh
 okay
 I
 get
 it
 a
 little
 bit.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 elements
 that
 make
 it


like
 really
 hard
 to
 gra
 like
 model


context
 protocol.
 Like
 what
 the
 hell
 do


those
 words
 mean?
 Yeah.


>> Like
 it
 doesn't
 actually
 speak.


>> Even
 the
 naming
 it's
 just
 okay.
 So
 MC


framework
 uh
 caretakers


you
 might
 as
 well
 call
 it
 magic
 context


protocol
 for
 for
 all
 we
 know.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 What
 one
 of
 my
 most
 uh


popular
 sessions
 like
 so
 you
 know
 it's


not
 just
 me
 doing
 the
 sessions
 during


product
 day.
 other
 people
 will
 do
 them,


but
 like
 one
 of
 my
 most
 popular
 one
 one


was
 called
 WTF
 is
 MCP
 and
 I
 just
 spent


like
 a
 whole
 hour
 telling
 people
 what


MCP
 was
 and
 afterwards
 they're
 like,


"Oh,
 I
 get
 it
 now.
 It's
 kind
 of
 like
 web


search
 but
 like
 more
 tools."
 I'm
 like,


"Yeah."


But
 anyway,
 [laughter]


>> so
 I
 I
 I
 built
 this
 thing
 and
 like
 I


have
 like
 so
 you
 know
 my
 wife
 also
 so


works
 in
 technology
 but
 she's
 in


marketing
 and
 I'm
 sitting
 like
 next
 to


her
 and
 you
 know
 how
 it
 is
 like
 you
 have


a
 baby
 and
 like
 you
 know
 your
 your


nights
 are
 a
 little
 bit
 slower
 and
 so


you
 have
 some
 slack
 time
 just
 kind
 of


like
 hang
 out
 and
 she's
 watching
 TV
 and


I'm
 sitting
 there
 on
 the
 laptop
 like


working
 on
 this
 MCT
 server
 and
 I
 got
 it


to
 do
 a
 thing
 right
 I
 got
 it
 to
 like
 you


know
 I
 wrote
 a
 query
 uh
 a
 prompt
 within


claude
 and
 it
 talked
 to
 my
 MCP
 server


and
 it
 ran
 a
 thing
 and
 it
 returned
 data


back
 and
 I
 was
 just
 like,
 "You
 have
 no


idea
 how
 how
 credible
 this
 is."
 And


she's
 like, "I
 don't
 know
 what
 an
 MCU


is."
 Like,
 "What
 is
 an
 MCU?"
 And
 I'm


like, "It's
 not
 MCU,
 it's
 MCP.
 God
 damn


it."
 Um,
 so
 I
 recorded
 so
 I
 recorded
 a


demo
 of
 me
 using
 it.
 And
 um,
 this
 isn't


the
 exact
 one,
 but
 this
 is
 something


very
 similar,
 which
 was
 um,
 I
 so
 I
 have


a
 the
 my
 own
 MCP
 server
 that
 I
 hooked
 up


and
 I
 was
 I
 was
 just
 using
 the
 public


APIs,
 right?
 So
 like
 I
 have
 test


accounts
 for
 Pendo.
 I
 didn't
 have
 any


special
 access.
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 dev


platform.
 I
 was
 just
 able
 to
 like
 do


this
 on
 top
 of
 the
 APIs.
 Actually,
 any


customer
 could
 do
 this.
 Um,
 and
 so
 I
 had


this
 MTP
 server
 that
 can
 do
 things
 like


just
 grab
 really
 basic
 stuff
 like
 how


many
 pages
 uh
 which
 pages
 are
 the
 top


pages,
 how
 often
 they
 accessed,
 you


know,
 what
 are
 things,
 you
 know,
 what


what
 does
 this
 this
 visitor
 do
 and
 that


visitor
 do?
 Um,
 so
 I
 was
 like,
 can
 you


create
 a
 beautiful
 dashboard
 that
 shows


me
 which
 pages,
 features,
 and
 guides


were
 the
 most
 used
 over
 the
 last
 30


days?
 And
 I
 think
 the
 key
 thing
 was
 that


I'm
 combining
 accessing
 the
 data
 and
 uh


having
 it
 create
 a
 dashboard.
 Uh
 so
 I


won't
 kind
 of
 go
 through
 all
 the
 things


I
 did
 made
 a
 bunch
 of
 tool
 calls.
 That's


not
 really
 important.
 But
 the
 important


thing
 was
 at
 the
 end
 I
 had
 it
 put
 the


data
 into
 this
 uh
 artifact.
 I'm
 I'm


sitting
 here
 in
 clawude
 and
 it's
 not
 I


mean
 I
 wouldn't
 ship
 this
 but
 just


visualizing
 the
 connection
 between


taking
 [clears throat]
 Pendo
 data
 which


now
 you
 know
 only
 exists
 within
 Pendo
 or


you
 can
 also
 export
 it
 and
 there's
 other


ways
 of
 getting
 access
 to
 it
 but
 making


it
 accessible
 on
 the
 level
 where
 someone


could
 just
 type
 in
 a
 thing
 like
 tell
 me


who
 what
 the
 top
 pages
 are
 and
 then
 show


me
 a
 dashboard
 really
 like
 changed


people's
 minds
 and
 with
 over
 the
 next


like
 couple
 months
 like
 I'm
 now
 chatting


with
 the
 CTO.
 The
 CTO
 is
 creating


another
 versions
 MCP
 um
 and
 you
 know


he's
 so
 he's
 create
 like
 we're
 we're


iterating
 creating
 uh
 starting
 to
 like


productional
 productionize
 um
 some
 of


these
 elements.
 I
 mean
 what
 I've
 done


here
 like
 they
 just
 they
 kind
 of
 moved


on
 the
 it
 wasn't
 the
 code
 that
 I
 wrote


or
 vibe
 coded
 was
 not
 important.
 What


was
 what
 was
 important
 was
 like
 I
 was


able
 to
 demonstrate
 the
 value
 of
 this


somewhat
 you
 know
 hard
 opaque
 technology


um
 to
 folks
 that
 like
 didn't
 maybe


didn't
 see
 it
 in
 the
 same
 way
 and
 that


has
 now
 actually
 that
 has
 like


significantly
 impacted
 our
 road
 map.
 So


like
 we're
 working
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 agents


within
 Pendo
 um
 that
 are
 leveraging
 sort


of
 the
 MCP
 but
 you
 know
 behind
 the


scenes
 and
 um
 there's
 other
 things
 that


we're
 planning
 to
 do
 with
 MCP
 and
 we


might
 have
 gotten
 there
 anyway.
 Um
 but


that
 uh
 that
 uh
 definitely
 sort
 of


accelerated
 our
 timeline
 for
 that.


Well,
 congratulations
 uh
 for
 for


cracking
 through
 that.
 And
 I
 think
 what


you
 said
 is
 exactly
 right,
 which
 is
 like


the
 code
 that
 you
 wrote
 is
 not


important.
 Like
 people
 get
 so
 wrapped


around
 the
 axle
 on
 the
 quality
 of
 like


quote
 unquote
 vibecoded
 stuff.
 Not
 the


issue.
 The
 issue
 is
 until
 you
 can


internally
 display
 value,


it
 is
 really
 hard
 to
 get
 anything
 done


in
 a
 product
 organization.
 And
 sometimes


you
 can
 internally
 display
 value
 by


saying
 a
 customer
 wants
 this.
 Like
 very


easy
 sales
 comes.
 I
 got
 like
 a
 top


quarter
 making
 deal.
 Customer
 wants


that.
 Okay.
 Like
 we
 love
 it.
 But


something
 that's
 a
 little
 bit
 more


nebulous,
 something
 that
 has
 a
 little


bit
 more
 of
 an
 intangible
 value.
 Like
 I


think
 we
 could
 use
 this
 new
 technology


or
 this
 new
 framework
 MCPS
 to
 give
 our


customers
 a
 better
 experience
 of
 our


product.
 Like
 it
 just
 doesn't
 click


until
 you
 can
 touch
 it.
 And
 so
 the
 more


you
 can
 use
 these
 tools
 to
 let
 your


peers
 sort
 of
 like
 touch
 your
 ideas,
 I


think
 the
 more
 as
 you
 said
 you
 can
 like


impact
 the
 road
 map
 which
 is
 what
 I
 hear


all
 the
 time
 from
 designers,
 engineers,


product
 managers
 like
 I'm
 tired
 of
 the


road
 map
 being
 given
 to
 me.
 How
 do
 I


like
 impact
 it?
 And
 this
 tool
 these


these
 tools
 are
 definitely
 a
 way
 way
 of


doing
 that.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 would
 say
 one
 just
 one
 tip


around
 this
 which
 I
 think
 is
 really


important
 to
 emphasize
 is
 that
 you
 know


you
 might
 sit
 sort
 of
 like
 you
 know
 you


might
 be
 designer
 or
 PM
 um
 I
 think
 it's


really
 important
 for
 everyone
 to


understand
 how
 this
 technology
 works


like
 I
 think
 you
 got
 to
 get
 a
 little


more
 technical
 you
 got
 to
 understand
 how


LLMs
 are
 working
 you
 have
 to
 understand


what
 like
 what
 an
 agent
 is
 you
 don't


have
 to
 be
 able
 to
 code
 these
 things
 you


don't
 have
 to
 be
 an
 ML
 engineer
 but
 um


if
 you
 are
 a
 creative
 person
 or
 someone


who
 is
 sort
 of
 in
 the
 solution
 space
 and


uh
 is
 trying
 to
 think
 about
 like
 what


like
 what
 are
 the
 different
 ways
 that
 I


can
 apply
 AI
 to
 this
 this
 problem.
 You


won't
 arrive
 at
 anything
 really


interesting
 unless
 you
 understand
 the


underlying
 technology.
 It's
 like
 an


architect.
 Like
 architects,
 yeah,
 they


they
 design
 like
 pretty
 buildings,
 but


they
 also
 understand
 how
 plumbing
 works


and
 electric
 and
 the
 electronics
 work,


right?
 Like
 they're
 they're
 not
 like
 the


electricians
 and
 the
 plumbers,
 right?


But
 like
 in
 order
 to
 build
 a
 functional


building
 that
 stands
 up
 and
 and
 is


functional,
 right?
 like
 you
 got
 to
 have


power
 sockets,
 you
 got
 to
 have
 room
 for


the
 pipes,
 like
 all
 that
 stuff
 is


important.
 I
 think
 the
 same
 thing


applies
 to
 PMs
 and
 designers.
 And
 I


think
 if
 you're
 an
 engineer,
 I
 think


it's
 also
 useful
 to
 understand
 like
 the


business
 side,
 the
 customer
 side,
 the


you
 know,
 like
 to
 really
 empathize
 with


the
 the
 issue,
 the
 the
 problems
 that


your
 customers
 have
 so
 that
 it,
 you


know,
 like
 what
 we're
 all
 looking
 for
 is


basically
 how
 do
 you
 sort
 of
 connect
 the


dots
 between
 the
 technologies
 that
 we


have
 available
 to
 us
 to
 solve
 customer


problems.
 H
 I
 couldn't
 hype
 you
 up
 more


because
 I
 have
 been
 screaming
 from
 the


rooftops.
 This
 is
 the
 era
 of
 the
 hard


skill.
 Like
 you
 need
 the
 hard
 skills
 to


take
 advantage
 of
 this
 stuff.
 I
 I
 didn't


call
 it
 out
 earlier,
 but
 I
 saw
 one
 of


your
 sessions
 was
 like
 intro
 to
 HTML
 and


CSS.
 Like
 that
 is
 actually
 going
 to
 be


the
 unlock
 for
 your
 designers
 because
 if


you
 can
 read
 CSS,
 a
 whole
 world
 has


opened
 up
 to
 you
 with
 these
 vibe
 coding


tools.
 And
 so
 yes,
 you
 need
 to
 know
 how


the
 stuff
 actually
 actually
 works.
 Okay,


so
 Brian,
 last
 question.
 This
 has
 been


so
 great,
 but
 got
 to
 have
 your
 your


strategy
 here.
 When
 AI
 is
 not
 listening,


when
 that
 NCP
 is
 not
 being
 vibe
 coded


correctly
 by
 cursor,
 what
 is
 your
 go-to


tactic?
 How
 do
 you
 get
 it
 unblocked?
 Do


you
 yell?


>> Uh,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 say


that
 I
 don't
 yell,
 but
 I
 do
 yell


sometimes.


>> [laughter]


>> The
 the
 other
 thing
 that
 I
 do
 too,
 which


I
 think
 is
 also
 really
 helpful,
 is
 I


say,
 "Okay,
 you're
 not
 you're
 not
 quite


getting
 it."
 Like
 think
 think
 about
 a


different
 way
 of
 approaching
 this,


right?
 Like
 I
 I'm
 trying
 to
 nudge
 it
 to


like
 it
 maybe
 it's
 sort
 of
 like
 locked


into
 a
 certain
 sort
 of


>> uh
 groove
 and
 I'm
 trying
 to
 to
 make
 it


think
 a
 little
 more
 broadly.
 I
 I
 don't


know if
 that
 actually
 helps,
 but
 I've


found
 that
 like
 sometimes
 that's
 useful.


So
 like


>> if
 I'm
 not
 yelling,
 it's
 just
 like,


"Okay,
 you
 tried
 this
 a
 million
 times.


Think
 about
 five
 other
 different
 ways


that
 you
 can
 solve
 this
 problem."
 and


and
 and
 go
 for
 it.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that's
 probably
 more


effective
 than
 my
 no


that
 I
 do
 when
 it's
 not
 working.
 Well,


Ryan,
 this
 has
 been
 awesome.
 Where
 can


we
 find
 you
 and
 how
 can
 we
 be
 helpful?


>> Yeah,
 so
 you
 can
 find
 me
 on
 on
 LinkedIn.


Um
 I
 try
 to
 post
 when
 I
 can
 and
 um
 yeah,


I
 mean,
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 a
 product


builder
 or
 um
 you
 know,
 you're


interested
 in
 working
 for
 a
 a
 company


that
 is
 sort
 of
 embracing
 AI,
 you
 should


check
 out
 Pendo.


>> Awesome.
 And
 thanks
 so
 much.

 much
