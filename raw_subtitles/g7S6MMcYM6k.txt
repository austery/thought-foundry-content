ARTHUR C BROOKS:
There's four big habits
that the happiest people have
that they engage in every day.
This is the happiness
pension plan.
These are the deposits
that you put in every day.
These are the things
to pay attention to.
Number one, all of
the happiest people
who have the highest levels
of enjoyment, satisfaction,
and meaning, which are the
macronutrients of happiness,
they are paying
attention, every day,
to their faith or philosophical
life, which is religious or not,
but is transcending themselves
and standing in awe of something
bigger.
I'll talk about
that in a second.
The second is their family life.
They're taking their
family life seriously.
The third is that they're taking
their friendships seriously.
And that's super hard for
people in business, especially
the higher you go in management,
the fewer real friends you have
and the more deal
friends that you have.
And deal friends don't count.
They're good.
But that's not the nutrient
that I'm talking about.
And last but not least is
dedicating your work to
earning your success and
serving other people.
It's faith, family, friends,
and work that serves.
Those are the big four.

ADI IGNATIUS: Your book
debuted at number five
on the New York Times
bestseller list.
What does that say
about us as a society?
ARTHUR C BROOKS: It says that
there are four books that people
like more.
Not that I'm super competitive,
but the truth of the matter
is that we have an
opportunity in our society
right now that we
often see as a crisis.
There is a happiness crisis.
I've been looking at the data
on human happiness in the United
States and around the
world for a long time.
And American happiness has,
in general, been in decline
since 1990, in general decline.
I mean, it's kind of a
climate of happiness,
ticking down little
by little by little.
And then starting
in about 2008, there
were three major storms that
created downward pressure
on happiness that
was really fast.
And so the result of it is
that crisis in happiness
is an opportunity for all of us.
And this is the
entrepreneurial mindset.
We're at the temple of
entrepreneurship and business
right here.
And the best business
publication in the world
should be all about seeing
crises as opportunities.
And that's, in point of
fact, what we're doing.
This book is buying the dip of
happiness, I guess you'd say.
ADI IGNATIUS: So many questions
to follow up on, but let me--
a basic question, because I
couldn't tell from what you just
said, are we basically happy?
Is anybody happy?
And how do we measure
whether we're happy or not?
ARTHUR C BROOKS: We're not.
And we are, in fact, not.
And that's an important
thing for us to keep in mind.
I ask people all the
time, what do you want?
And they say, I
want to be happy.
I say, wrong, you
can't be happy.
You can be happier than you
were because it's a direction.
Happiness is not a destination.
We have negative emotions.
This is part of life on Earth.
We have a limbic system.
And it was developed between
2 and 40 million years ago
in our brain that processes
negative emotions as an alarm
system to keep us safe, to pass
on our genes, to not starve.
It's very important that
we have negative emotions.
We also have
negative experiences
because that's part
of the human-- that's
part of human life as well.
The result of that is that
perfect happiness doesn't
exist in the mortal coil.
Perhaps sometime later, that's
above my metaphysical pay grade.
But I will say that
the idea of trying
to attain perfect
happiness right now
is one of the greatest reasons
that people are actually
pretty miserable because
they wake up and say,
I'm not happy today.
Well, yeah, of
course you're not.
But you can be happier today if
you actually have the skills,
change your habits, and
share it with others.
You can be happier.
ADI IGNATIUS: You
have said often
that money, power, the
trappings of success,
do not necessarily
translate into happiness.
And I feel like
we all know that.
And yet we live our lives in
pursuit of all these things,
not just for ego gratification
or for material well-being,
but because I think we sense
that they will provide us
happiness.
ARTHUR C BROOKS: Yeah.
ADI IGNATIUS: Are we--
ARTHUR C BROOKS: Why?
Right?
ADI IGNATIUS: Well--
ARTHUR C BROOKS:
It's weird, isn't it?
ADI IGNATIUS: Why not?
Is maybe the question.
ARTHUR C BROOKS: Well, so the
first big myth about happiness
is that you can be happy.
And the correct attitude
is you can be happier.
The second big myth
is that mother nature
wants you to be happy.
She doesn't care.
Mother nature has only two
goals for all of us, which is
survival and gene propagation.
We have urges.
And we think-- that come
from mother nature--
we think that if we satisfy
these urges for money,
and power, and pleasure,
and fame, and admiration,
and Instagram
followers, or whatever,
that we will achieve the
happiness that we deeply want.
But that's wrong.
And so the result of it is
that we get into a trap.
Now, most people are
able to escape that trap
because their worldly
dreams never come true.
And so they have to settle
for the second best, which
is just lovely relationships,
and a fun family,
and good friends.
But a few unlucky
individuals, their dreams
come true in worldly terms.
And they find out pretty,
pretty quickly that they
have the wrong dreams.
And a lot of my students are
going to be among those people.
So the first thing that
I tell them in my class
right here on this
campus is I say
that you believe mother
nature is telling you
that if you attain
your worldly dreams,
that happiness
will come for free.
And then I say something
that makes them panic.
And think about this, I'm
going to tell you the sentence,
and there's one word in the
sentence that makes them panic.
The truth is, if you
shoot for happiness,
you will have enough success.
What's the word that
freaks them out?
"Enough," "enough."
ADI IGNATIUS: It's never enough.
ARTHUR C BROOKS:
It's never enough
because mother nature
says it's not enough.
And so that's one
of the things that I
have to help them understand.
When you understand the
science of what's actually
happening in your
brain, then you
can actually tailor your habits.
Human life is funny because
of the prefrontal cortex,
this incredibly--
the 30% of our brain by
weight, the supercomputer
in the front of our heads, it
gives us two parts in life.
There are animal instincts.
And there are moral aspirations.
And what we need to do if we
want to live a happy life is not
be content with the
animal instincts,
but rather, to choose
the moral aspirations
that, a large part of
the time, are standing up
to mother nature.
ADI IGNATIUS: So you've kind
of called BS on what some of us
might think, one,
we can be happy.
No, we can be happier.
Two, that maybe the
normal state is happiness,
and you're saying
that's probably not what
mother nature intended.
Who sold us this idea
that we could be happy?
I think we all kind
of grew up thinking
that's attainable and normal.
ARTHUR C BROOKS:
Yeah, well, part of it
is that there are moments in
our lives when we do feel happy.
The problem with that
is really the third myth
about happiness, which is
that happiness is a feeling.
And it isn't.
Feelings are
evidence of happiness
like the smell of your turkey
is evidence of your Thanksgiving
dinner.
And so when people are searching
for a feeling, what they're
searching for is
positive emotions,
which once again, exist
only to give you information
about the outside world.
When you have positive emotions,
there's a part of your brain
that says, you have just sensed
something that's an opportunity.
You should approach it.
When you're feeling
negative emotions,
you're sensing that
something is a threat.
And you should avoid it.
That's what emotions are.
Happiness is not an emotion.
Happiness has positive
emotions associated with it.
And we feel that
when we want it,
and we want it to be as
continuous as possible.
And that's as old
as humanity itself.
The right approach is to
understand that happiness
is something actually to
be pursued and divided
into three big scientific
categories, which are enjoyment,
satisfaction, and meaning.
That's an approach
that can reliably
help you to become happier
every year, not every day,
but certainly every year.
ADI IGNATIUS: All
right, so let's say
you're concerned about
the political situation.
OK, like can't sleep
at night concerned.
And your response to that is
to bury your head in the sand,
and not really follow
events, because there's
too distressing, so you work in
your hobbies, you play tennis--
asking for a
friend, by the way--
ARTHUR C BROOKS: Yeah,
yeah, I hear you.
Yeah, yeah.
ADI IGNATIUS: But that
feels like a dereliction
of one's civic duty,
a path, possibly
to peace of mind,
happiness, perhaps.
But where do you
come down on that?
ARTHUR C BROOKS: So
it's absolutely the case
that one of the
things that's happened
in our technologized world
is that the outside world has
become very small and come to us
in ways that we can't affect it.
I mean, there are whole parts of
the world that we can't affect,
but we feel as if we could
because the information is
arriving so quickly.
Everything that's far away
feels local in the world
of social media, for example,
in the 24 hour news cycle.
And that creates a profound
cognitive disruption for us.
It creates a dissonance for us.
All these bad things
are happening.
I should do something,
but I can't do anything.
So I feel helpless.
And that leads me to anxiety,
and sadness, and fear.
And that's what a lot of people
are feeling all the time.
The result of that is
not to check out, not
ever check the news.
But I do have protocols
that I recommend to people
all the time.
You should not be reading more
than half an hour of news a day,
ever.
And it should be in one block.
And not more than half of
it should be political.
You're not going to get
any more information
than you had this morning
by looking at the newspaper
tonight and seeing if
something has actually
happened in Congress.
Nothing happened in Congress.
And that's an important
thing for us to keep in mind.
And then how do
we spend the rest
of our time, our
ample free time?
What do we do with the habits?
Funny, when you
break a habit, which
is reprogramming a part of
your brain called the nucleus
accumbens, you feel like
you're so at loose ends
because you have so
much time on your hands.
When I quit smoking, I felt like
I had all the time in the world
because I would have
been smoking before.
And so I had to do
something with my time.
When you're not
checking the news,
and you're not
looking at politics,
and you're not
trading information
with the people
who already agree
with you, that so and so is
terrible, terrible, terrible,
and everything is
awful, awful, awful,
you feel like you have a
lot of time on your hands.
How do you spend that time?
And the answer is by affecting
change that you can change.
And that's profoundly local.
That's your family, that's
your neighborhood, that's
your community, that's your
town, that's your university.
That's where real
change happens,
getting more local, more active
with the time that's actually
freed up from the
things you can't do.
And watch your
happiness start to rise.
ADI IGNATIUS: Thank you.
OK, I'm going to take that
from that very high altitude
to the workplace.
There's a feeling that
the tasks you do at work,
you're going from one
performance anxiety filled
moment to the next.
And there's not a
through line of joy,
exactly, because we have these
tasks we have to deliver.
How do we get out of that
particular perception trap?
ARTHUR C BROOKS: Yeah, well,
the truth of the matter
is that most people don't feel
a lot of anxiety in their jobs.
They don't.
It depends on the
performance, the kind of job
that you find yourself in.
So people in leadership
jobs have a lot of anxiety.
The more leadership
responsibility that you have,
the more anxiety, in general,
you're going to have.
And that's something
that's actually chosen.
And that's a big surprise
to a lot of CEOs.
The number oine and two
emotions in the first 24 months
of an average CEO's tenure,
the number one and two emotions
are loneliness and anger, not
joy and contentment, not joy
and lovely surprise.
No, that's not how it works.
The only surprises you get as
CEO is like the general council
called.
That's bad, or whatever
it happens to be.
And a lot of them are
really caught by surprise
because once again, your ancient
limbic system says, climb, man,
the brass ring.
That's where it's at.
It's going to be so great.
And they get there,
and they don't like it.
The number one predictor
of CEO demise, by the way,
is not liking the job of CEO.
And there are CEOs
all over this country,
there are managers
all over this country
and all over the world
who want to be CEO,
but don't want to
do CEO, because
the negative emotionality
is so intense and so high.
And one of the things
that I recommend
leaders do a lot is actually
step into more creative roles,
step into more
contemplative roles,
step into more supporting roles.
And they can actually be happy.
You have to be really,
really suited to bear up
under a lot of anxiety.
Anxiety is nothing more
than unfocused fear.
That's the definition of
anxiety, unfocused fear,
which is usually a
maladaptation of the amygdala
in the limbic
system of the brain.
You need to how it works and
be incredibly self-managing.
ADI IGNATIUS: So I want to
talk a little bit about what
has happened in the workplace.
There was a period,
and we certainly
wrote a lot about it, where
it was in vogue to really try
to make sure your
employee base was happy,
was seeing that they
could be totally there,
bring their full self.
I'd say there's a
backlash to that
now, articulated
by Mark Zuckerberg.
We need more masculine
energy, which
I'm not sure what
that means, but I
think it means less of
what I'm talking about.
But do you have a view
as to whether this--
let's say those are two
legitimate paradigms, that you--
the second is like
command, you do what I say.
This is a company who cares
about your whole self.
We're just doing work here.
Do you have a view
as to which is
better in terms of creating joy,
both for the individual and then
creating positive results
for the institution?
I mean, that's a big question.
But do you have
thoughts on that?
ARTHUR C BROOKS: I
have the data on this.
It's very, very clear.
Happier employees are more
profitable, more productive
employees.
That's just the way it is.
If you can have a
happier workforce,
you're going to have
a better company.
And the results are
going to be there.
And I know this because of the
work of Irrational Capital,
which is a research firm
on Wall Street, which I've
done some informal advisory
unpaid to them because I'm
so interested in their data.
And what they do is they've
looked at 7,500 companies,
all publicly listed
companies, the entire S&P 500,
the entire Russell 1000, big
companies, little companies.
And they've looked
retrospectively
at these companies.
And they have some proprietary
data on workplace well-being.
And they measure it in a whole
bunch of very robust ways.
And what they find is,
for example, if you're
in the top 20% of
workplace well-being,
you will be, on
average, about 520 basis
points above the S&P 500 in your
stock price over the past year.
This stuff is really performing.
It really, really is
a good investment.
The problem is people don't
what workplace happiness means.
It's ill-defined.
I spent a lot of
time in California.
And I'm talking to
Silicon Valley firms.
And they'll ask their employees,
what would make you happier?
And the employees don't know.
They just know
they're not happy.
And so they'll say stuff like,
I don't know, a ping pong table.
How about avocado toast?
I don't know.
And so it'll be like OK, avocado
toast and ping pong tables.
And the people are
still not happy.
And that's because that's
not what they want.
They want friendship.
They want to be actually
have friends at work.
They want to feel
empowered and they're
getting better at their jobs.
They want to feel like
management is listening to them
and taking their suggestions.
They want efficiency.
They don't want to have their
time wasted with stupid meetings
all day long.
By the way, those are the
top four of the six variables
that we're talking about here.
And if you get that stuff
right, you use the data,
you be a bit of a social
scientist, you win.
You win.
ADI IGNATIUS: All
right, let's talk
about meetings for a second.
ARTHUR C BROOKS: Yeah, I've
written about meetings.
I wrote in a volume
together with you.
ADI IGNATIUS: I have
some colleagues here,
so this is for you, too.
So we all know
meetings are terrible.
We all know about the
tyranny of meetings.
You've written about,
they're the worst.
They sap your energy.
They sap your happiness.
And maybe we go
there, we respond.
And there are no meetings
on Fridays for a while.
And then they come back, they
come back, they come back.
And it makes us feel miserable.
And it feels like it's taking
away from our real jobs.
It's hard to remember
what they were because it
seems to be meetings and email.
So help us here because
so much good intention,
so much understanding
of everything
you said, and yet
none of us seems
to be able to break the
tyranny of the meeting.
ARTHUR C BROOKS: And
part of the reason
is because they are
a necessary evil,
but we focus on the
necessary, not on the evil.
And that's the thing
to keep in mind.
The truth is we should
be minimizing meetings.
And we should have
good meeting hygiene
at every company, every
organization around the world.
And universities are the worst.
Faculty meetings, they'll say,
we really only have half an hour
of business, but we're going
to set aside 90 minutes
in case something comes up.
And if you're in
management, you say,
we're probably not going
to use all this time.
And I'm like, yeah,
sure, here we go.
And then you get to
the end of the 30
minutes of actual
business and say,
does anybody have anything
else on their mind?
And it's always the
same cast of characters.
And this is very, very common
in nonprofits in particular.
The problem with that
is that drives out
the people that are most--
that want to go back to their
offices and do their work.
This is the people who
are most interested
in their own productivity
and efficiency,
are most discouraged by
that kind of behavior.
And so the way to fix this is by
having actual distinct protocols
that are well studied.
And I talk about in this book.
So for example,
meetings should never
involve people who
don't need to be there.
And anytime it looks like
a meeting isn't necessary,
make it Christmas morning
at work and cancel it.
Everybody will
love you if you're
known for canceling meetings.
No meetings should
be over 30 minutes.
You don't need more than
30 minutes, I'm sorry.
And what the result of it is
that there's no throat clearing.
There's no preambles.
There's no did you go
sailing this weekend?
How's your Cape House?
Did you get those steps fixed?
None of it.
It's like get to business.
Get to business, because
you've only got 30 minutes.
And people are going to
leave after 30 minutes.
And having some of
these protocols in place
mean that people
are going to say,
yep, we need to
have these meetings.
If I'm at the meeting,
it's because I'm
going to have to
present or somebody's
going to have to present to me.
It's only going to
last 30 minutes.
And if it's not necessary,
it's going to get canceled.
Those are the three iron laws.
There are some more.
ADI IGNATIUS: OK,
so let's keep going
on how to build a relatively
happy work culture.
So the ping pong table
and the avocado toast
may or may not help.
What you just talked about,
it may or may not help.
To what extent can leaders
create a happier workplace?
ARTHUR C BROOKS:
They can do a lot.
The number one predictor of
somebody hating their job
is a bad boss.
That's the number one
predictor, bad leadership.
And it has a lot to do with
the character, personality,
and leadership
style of the boss.
If you're the boss, you can
ruin the workplace very,
very quickly.
And that's one of
the reasons that we
need a lot of emotional and
psychological equilibrium, a lot
of emotional self-management.
That's why I'm training
managers here at HBS.
I want them to be happy people.
That's the number one
predictor of being
a good boss is working
on your own happiness.
And a lot of bosses
don't understand this.
By the way, the worst
parenting advice
ever is you're never happier
than your unhappiest child.
That's just bad
parenting, straight up,
because nobody wants to have
an unhappy mother or father.
And nobody wants to
have an unhappy boss.
If you're in any
position of leadership,
you have an ethical
responsibility
to be working on your
happiness because it's
your gift to the people
over whom you're a steward.
ADI IGNATIUS: And we're probably
picking the wrong people
as managers.
ARTHUR C BROOKS:
Well, we do sometimes.
But there are some
spectacular managers
as well, self-equilibrating,
very well self-managing people.
People who are not stuck
in the empathy trap,
but are really paying
attention to compassion,
who really want the best
for the people around them.
And there are some wonderful,
wonderful managers.
ADI IGNATIUS: So
all right, so I want
to talk about the consequences,
then, of all this unhappiness.
OK, so individually
it's probably apparent.
In terms of the workplace,
you've got the data.
But in terms of
society more broadly,
what is the consequence of
this lack of contentment?
ARTHUR C BROOKS: When
people aren't happy,
the first thing that
happens is that they
don't lift each other up.
It's interesting because
this is the first thing
that you see in couples is
when one becomes unhappy,
it spreads like a
virus in families.
That's called
emotional contagion.
Emotional contagion is
very, very, very strong.
And so that's why it's
so critically important
that there be some form
of quarantine, emotional
quarantine, and that we be--
that we emotionally
understand ourselves.
And we understand that
it's no service to anybody
in a family or a workplace
that we be bringing unhappiness
to it.
So that's the first
thing that we actually
see is trying to contain
emotional contagion.
Those are the things that
we can all pay attention to.
And we can create an inventory
in each one of our lives.
Am I doing it or not?
Am I doing it or not?
And then what am I going
to do to get after this?
And I have very
specific protocols
in each one of
these areas that I
recommend to my
students and anybody
who wants to hear about them.
And I'll give you one example of
this on the faith side, people,
how do I get started?
I wasn't raised religious.
And I don't want
to be religious.
No problem.
But there's a funny
thing here at Harvard,
one of the most popular classes
among the undergraduates
is astronomy.
It's like, who cares?
Astronomy, right?
And they're not astronomers,
like English majors,
or economics majors,
or something.
And you ask them, and
they'll say, I don't know,
but on Thursday morning, I
go into my astronomy class,
and I'm all stressed
out because I
had a big argument
with my mom, and I
don't think my boyfriend
likes me anymore,
and I'm worried about my grades.
And I come out an
hour and a half later,
and I realize I'm just a
speck on a speck on a speck.
In other words, they get small.
And they make the
universe large.
That's transcendence,
which you can
get from walking in
nature before dawn.
By the way, walk in
nature before dawn
while the sun comes up.
That's called the
brahma muhurta,
an ancient Vedic thinking.
And it's very well studied
in neuroscientific terms,
a really important idea.
Without devices, never
with devices, or study
Bach fugues, or start a
Vipassana meditation practice,
or study the stoic philosophers.
I go to mass every day.
I'm a Catholic, most
important thing in my life.
Do you.
But you got to have something.
That's an example of the
protocols that we talk about.
ADI IGNATIUS: All right, so I'm
going to go to another audience
question.
This is anonymous.
And it's got some sass.
I'm an overachieving millennial.
And a majority of
my friends are now
talking about
moving to compounds
and giving up on the
corporate hustle.
Is that the right move?
ARTHUR C BROOKS: No, no,
that's not the right move.
I mean, you do you, for sure,
but the whole idea of-- it's
interesting because
there was last year,
there was a news story
some of you may remember.
Hedge fund manager, I mean,
being a hedge fund manager
is just the world's worst job.
I mean, it's just
super hardcore.
And you're on all the time.
It's incredibly
stressful if you're
going to be successful at all.
And this guy, he does
it, and he quits.
He had a couple of down years.
And he quit.
This is not a friend of mine.
I just read about it in the
news, like everybody else.
And they asked him, what
are you going to go do?
He says, I'm going
to go sit on a beach.
I'm going to go sit on a beach.
And I'm like, yeah,
for four days.
And then you're going to
be driving your wife crazy.
And you're going to start
to get really uncomfortable.
And you're going to want
something more than that.
Most people are not made for
the chill life, let alone
the monastic life.
Some people are made for the
monastic life, but certainly
nobody who's actually
been in the hustle culture
to begin with.
What you need to do is
to get serious about what
hustle culture means, so it can
be generative, and productive,
and loving toward the world.
If you're not loving
the world, you're
doing it wrong is
what it comes down to.
If you're loving yourself to
the exclusion of the world,
you're doing it wrong is
what it comes down to.
And so the protocols
from that involve
how can you be in
the hustle culture
by designing what we
would call leisure
with the same kind
of seriousness
that you do your work.
Now, the authority on
that is Josef Pieper,
the great mid 20th century
German philosopher,
who his most famous book is
really, really worth reading.
It's on the reading list on
my website for those of you
who are interested.
It's called Leisure,
The Basis of Culture.
The basis of culture.
And he's not talking about
chilling on a beach, man.
He's talking about
learning, and worshipping,
and developing your soul
with as much seriousness
as you actually
would your career.
And I've had to help
a lot of millennials,
hard-charging millennials,
and workaholic types like you
and me, Adi, to redesign
their lives in such a way
that it has that kind of
profound moral and emotional
seriousness.
And that's the solution.
ADI IGNATIUS: So I want to
talk about more about AI.
So I guess I'm in
the camp of people
who think AI is incredible.
It will get exponentially
better and better and better.
It will wipe out many, many,
many white collar jobs.
Even the techno
optimists don't seem
to be able to plausibly
say, oh, but we're
going to create new jobs
in some other fields.
So a reasonable chance of a
very large displacement of labor
that won't simply be absorbed.
But anyway, go with
me for a second.
You might disagree with that.
So then the
conversation inevitably
goes to universal basic income.
And some people are
appalled by the idea.
Some people embrace it.
But it's interesting
to me if, look,
I'm a person who lives to work.
I'm not proud of that.
But as opposed to
working to live.
So I get the satisfaction
that we get from work.
But I'm not sure it's the
only way to get satisfaction.
And so I'm imagining a
world where maybe there
is some form of
universal basic income,
but basically, we're thinking
not about material wealth,
but thinking about happiness,
gross national happiness,
but individual happiness.
So that if you got
away from the idea
I need to work 40 hours
or 50 hours to make money,
and that defines me, the UBI
concept may not be so horrible.
It may be a recasting of
how we do work-life balance
and how we find
value in our life.
What do you think about that?
ARTHUR C BROOKS: I've written
a lot about unearned income.
And I've written
about lotteries.
I've written about inheritances.
And I've written about
welfare payments.
And they have much
the same effect
on all three
populations, which is
to say that they tend
to demotivate people.
Now, I believe in a
safety net, strongly
believe in a safety net.
To me, that's the
greatest achievement
of the capitalist system is
creating the largesse where
we can actually support
people above a certain level
of subsistence.
That's a wonderful miracle.
I'm really grateful for that.
But the truth of the
matter that is it's
incredibly demotivating
to not earn your way.
Human beings want
to earn their way.
Why?
Because to be needed as a human
being is the essence of dignity.
To be unneeded is
the basis of despair.
And people aren't stupid.
They know it.
If you're from a rich
family, and you're
kind of a wastrel layabout, and
your parents treat you that way,
but they say, OK, you go do
open your candle shop downtown
and I'm going to subsidize it.
That's a great candle
shop or whatever
it is, you're gonna
know that you're
on welfare from mom and dad.
And that's going to be
incredibly demotivating
because we have 100 ways
from Sunday to understand
whether or we're being treated
with dignity, whether we're
treated as an asset
being developed
or a liability being managed.
And that's the big
problem that we
have with a lot of our
public assistance programs.
That's a lot of--
almost any system in which
people are systematically
on unearned sources
of income is a society
that's going to get less happy.
That's the inherent
problem from that.
That's one of the
reasons that I'm
most interested in making
people more productive.
How can people actually
be more productive?
How can we have better
education systems that develops
what people are good at?
And that's where we actually
need to start actually
using our expertise and our
ingenuity is figuring out
how to teach people, and
how to learn different ways,
and how to actually
find the effectiveness
that people naturally have.
Because people, every single
person has incredible gifts.
And it's a stain on our
society that we've just
decided that certain people who
do well in traditional classroom
settings, that they're the
ones who've got the gifts.
And they're the ones
who get the prizes.
It's not right.
ADI IGNATIUS: People are
asking for Arthur to say more
about the empathy trap.
ARTHUR C BROOKS: Yeah, oh, yeah,
I just threw that one out there
like a big matzo ball.
So probably the most
overrated emotion
that we have in modern
society today is empathy.
And empathy sounds
really, really good.
But what it is is feeling
the pain of another.
And on it's own,
it's not effective.
And actually can be
quite destructive.
And we all know this.
I mean, the most unsuccessful
parents of teenagers
are extremely empathetic.
The most successful parents of
teenagers are compassionate.
And that's the distinction
that we have to make.
Compassion has four parts to it.
You understand what
somebody's problem is.
You feel it enough to be
able to connect to it.
You know that there is a
solution and know what it is.
And you have the courage
to undertake the solution,
even if the person you're
helping doesn't like it.
That's what it means
to be a good boss.
That's what it means
to be a good mother.
That's what it means
to be a good leader.
That's what it means
to be a good citizen
is to be a compassionate all
the time, with no exceptions.
But if you're just walking
around holding people's pain,
you're going to be paralyzed.
And you're not going to
actually help the people that
actually need to change.
Because most of
you have had kids.
They don't know the
changes they need to make.
And they don't want to make
the changes they need to make.
And you found
yourself saying, look,
I'm your dad, not your friend.
That's an expression
of compassion,
not empathy right there.
And that's what we
need to take on.
And that we have to
have the courage,
and strength, and emotional
fortitude to do just that.
ADI IGNATIUS: So if you could
remake the modern office,
a few steps, or create
it from scratch.
What does it look like?
ARTHUR C BROOKS: A lot
of avocado toast, man.
That stuff's great.
ADI IGNATIUS: I
knew that was it.
ARTHUR C BROOKS: Yeah, yeah.
I mean, it's one in which
people are highly collaborative
and working with each other.
It's a workplace in which--
and I have a workplace
that I'm really fond of.
It's a company that I
was privileged to be
able to start some
years ago, where
everybody has a functional skill
that's 75% of what they do.
But 25% of their time is
everybody else's business.
And so everybody else is
in everybody else's grill.
Where the higher up you
are in the org chart,
the lower you are, because
you're taking orders
from the seven direct
reports above you who
are coming into your
office and saying,
you're the only one who can
solve this problem for me.
That's the kind of workplace
that I actually want,
where people are coming in
because they have friends
in the workplace, and there's
a feeling of FOMO when you're
actually doing it just by Zoom.
That's the kind of workplace
that I actually want.
And maybe it has a ping pong
table and maybe it doesn't.
But the whole point is that
there's a sense of mission.
And there's a sense of duty.
And there's a sense of love.
That's what I want
in the workplace.
ADI IGNATIUS: So
you've given some tips,
but even they were a
little complicated.
What's one thing people
could do tonight.
ARTHUR C BROOKS: Yeah, let
me give-- let's put together
a formula to remember, OK?
And the formula, there's
the world's formula
that's a big lie.
And that's not just capitalism.
It's mother nature.
This is wired into
the human genome.
This is your limbic
system at work.
And it says, basically,
if you want to be happy,
do three things.
Use people, love things,
and worship yourself.
That's what you should do.
I mean, stuff is
an awesome, more
stuff in your cave, more
stuff in your house,
more stuff, love it,
love it, love it.
Because you'll find
happiness that way.
Use people because they're
there for your gratification
and for your ambition.
And worship yourself because
you're the center of everything.
Do that a lot, and you'll
actually find happiness.
That's completely wrong, but
it's so close to the truth.
It's so close that
it beguiles you.
You need to change the
verbs and the nouns.
Here's the formula.
Love people because only
people are worth loving.
Use things with gratitude
and abundance because they're
beautiful, but only use them.
Don't love them.
And worship the divine as you
understand it because that's
worth worshipping.
That's the transcendence
that I'm talking about.
Do that.
Live that formula, and life
absolutely starts to change.
And all the other things
that we're talking about
starts to make sense.
ADI IGNATIUS: Arthur
C. Brooks, thank you
for being our guest
on the HBR IdeaCast.
ARTHUR C BROOKS: Thank you.
