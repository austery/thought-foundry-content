[Speaker 1]: 对的，
[Speaker 1]:  hello，
[Speaker 1]:  everyone。
[Speaker 1]:  welcome to cork says i'm core recently，
[Speaker 1]:  the US department of justice in accordance with the recently enacted abstein transparency act，
[Speaker 1]:  released more than million lion ages of orioriginal investigation files in batches。
[Speaker 1]:  as a result，
[Speaker 1]:  the long dormment abstein case has once again return to the public spotlight and become a focus of public attention。
[Speaker 1]:  the abstein case is so well known that almost everyone has heard of it，
[Speaker 1]:  but precisely because of this，
[Speaker 1]:  it has to some extent，
[Speaker 1]:  hinred the public understanding of it。
[Speaker 1]:  why？
[Speaker 1]:  because there's a phenomenon in psychology in social communication called the familiarity illusion。
[Speaker 1]:  this means that when an eventor person is too famous，
[Speaker 1]:  and you heard about it。
[Speaker 1]:  so many times your brain automatically assumes you already understand it and stop seeking further information，
[Speaker 1]:  leading to only a superficial or even incorrect understanding。
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  everyone knows einstein，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  but if i were to ask you，
[Speaker 1]:  what kind of person was einstein in real life？
[Speaker 1]:  what were his political leanings？
[Speaker 1]:  what was his personality like？
[Speaker 1]:  was he tasted in or socially outgoing？
[Speaker 1]:  what would his tweets look like if you were alive today？
[Speaker 1]:  probably very few people could answer what you know about einstein is probably just that einsteal golve man with messy hair and a ptrutruting time。
[Speaker 1]:  one of the greatest scientists and human history who created equals mix squred in the theory of relativity。
[Speaker 1]:  why does this happen？
[Speaker 1]:  because if something is too famous，
[Speaker 1]:  it inevitably enters the realm of mass communication and is repeatedly disseminated mass communication，
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  cannot delve into too much depth for complexity and can only use labels because they are easy to remember。
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  when you mention zooooly yang，
[Speaker 1]:  you think of certain the country，
[Speaker 1]:  dilegally and tal death。
[Speaker 1]:  when you mention ed，
[Speaker 1]:  you e，
[Speaker 1]:  you think of certain the country willy。
[Speaker 1]:  and when you mention wanging way，
[Speaker 1]:  you think of traitder，
[Speaker 1]:  similarly，
[Speaker 1]:  the upstein case faces a similar situation，
[Speaker 1]:  everyone knows about it。
[Speaker 1]:  but the details of the case who was involved，
[Speaker 1]:  what twists in turns，
[Speaker 1]:  it went through。
[Speaker 1]:  and what problems in american society，
[Speaker 1]:  it reflects are things that very few people can answer，
[Speaker 1]:  especially in the chinese speaking world。
[Speaker 1]:  the information is a mix of truth and lies in the next two episodes。
[Speaker 1]:  i，
[Speaker 1]:  the systematically discuss this itself。
[Speaker 1]:  in this first episode，
[Speaker 1]:  i will focus on the estein ase ase itself，
[Speaker 1]:  including his rise to prominence ence how he，
[Speaker 1]:  he starfrom huhumble ginnings as popoboy with nothing，
[Speaker 1]:  building an empire of connections that spend across multiple countries and the next two prominfifiguin in litics and even the scientific artistic fields in the latter half of the program，
[Speaker 1]:  i will focus on some of the most important names involved，
[Speaker 1]:  including trump clinton，
[Speaker 1]:  bill gates and the most controversial and problematic。
[Speaker 1]:  one yellon must did they participate。
[Speaker 1]:  and to what extent i will also analyze some of the most common rumors circulating on the internet in the next episode。
[Speaker 1]:  i will combine what i've learned to discuss the chinese version of jeoffrey epsine story，
[Speaker 1]:  which is both familiar and yet unfamiliar to many without further to do，
[Speaker 0]:  lets begin。
[Speaker 1]:  in january，
[Speaker 1]:  nineteen，
[Speaker 1]:  nineand fifty three，
[Speaker 1]:  jeoffrey edward epstein was born into an eastern european jewish family in brooklin new york city，
[Speaker 1]:  according to our general understanding，
[Speaker 1]:  being born in new york and being jewish would usually suggest well for some kind of background。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  epstein was unfortunately，
[Speaker 1]:  a three，
[Speaker 1]:  nothing jewish person，
[Speaker 1]:  no money，
[Speaker 1]:  no connections and no education。
[Speaker 1]:  he worked as allong more in a nearby park，
[Speaker 1]:  and he didn't even inheit the traditional jewish virtue of academic excellence。
[Speaker 1]:  he graduated from a very ordinary public high school。
[Speaker 1]:  and although he entered college twice，
[Speaker 1]:  he dropped out both times without even completing his bathelor's degree based on interviews。
[Speaker 1]:  and recollections from those around him，
[Speaker 1]:  young epstein exhibited in extreme，
[Speaker 1]:  almost pathological lack of patients and a strong class anxiety about his status as a long wor's son，
[Speaker 1]:  sisimple terms。
[Speaker 1]:  he didn't want to his his way。
[Speaker 1]:  he he dreamed of a sudden leave to success。
[Speaker 1]:  there are too important pieces of evidence to support this。
[Speaker 1]:  firstly，
[Speaker 1]:  his linguistictic abilities，
[Speaker 1]:  he he his ltreingly skilled imimitthe，
[Speaker 1]:  imcenence and imnors of upper class society。
[Speaker 1]:  this is a common survival instinct in the lower and middle class immigrant communities of new york and abstein was undoubtedly a master in this respect。
[Speaker 1]:  his ability to go from a son of a working class jewish h in brooklyin mingingling with wall street millionaires hollywood elites，
[Speaker 1]:  and even royalty is a testament to this talent。
[Speaker 1]:  secondly，
[Speaker 1]:  there are his two college dropouts。
[Speaker 1]:  abstein was quite clever while still a student that loughyat high school in brrooklin。
[Speaker 1]:  he skipped grades due to his exceptional matheabilities。
[Speaker 1]:  and was admitted to both the cooper union college for physical design and the mathematics graduate program in new york university。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  he soon realized there were too many true genius around him，
[Speaker 1]:  and his cleveress alone wasn't enough to make him stand out and achieve upwarard。
[Speaker 1]:  so formobility。
[Speaker 1]:  so in nineteen thousand and seventy one，
[Speaker 1]:  after realizing that mathematics wouldn't bring a menchanons in private jets，
[Speaker 1]:  he dropped out of college again and went to dolton one of the top private schools in manhattan with the children of the elite congregreted to teach physics and mathematics，
[Speaker 1]:  some might find a strange thinking，
[Speaker 1]:  if math ccan't make money，
[Speaker 1]:  how can being a high school teacher make him rich？
[Speaker 1]:  well，
[Speaker 1]:  it actually could abstein discovered that his mathematical abilities had a strong performative aspect while he couldn't excel in academics。
[Speaker 1]:  it was very useful for social purposes。
[Speaker 1]:  what does this mean？
[Speaker 1]:  it means abstein had exceptional mental calculation skills。
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  if you give them a random problem，
[Speaker 1]:  like three thousand nine hundred fifty four，
[Speaker 1]:  multiply by eight thousand five hundred thirty seven。
[Speaker 1]:  he accuculate the answer instantly without calculator，
[Speaker 1]: 不是不是 to ordinary people。
[Speaker 1]:  this certainly seems like a mathematical genius。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  it's a kind of genius more suited for perforance，
[Speaker 1]:  not necessssarthe kind。
[Speaker 1]:  that makes a true mathematition。
[Speaker 1]:  true mathematicians rely on logical deduction and the exploration of abstract boundaries，
[Speaker 1]:  which requires dedicated work and painstaking effort。
[Speaker 1]:  absteinin's mental calculation ability was more like intellectual showmantra in a social setting filled with influential people thrown out a profound mathematical。
[Speaker 1]:  conjector is far less impressive than performing a mental calculation of a six digital lltiplication problem。
[Speaker 1]:  this performit of genius can instantly create an illusion of intellect。
[Speaker 1]:  superiperiority installing a sense of eyin wealthy individuwho，
[Speaker 1]:  while rich might not be parparcularly intelliggaccorcording to those around him。
[Speaker 1]:  this mental calculation performance later became one of abstin's core social assets。
[Speaker 1]:  he used this trick on numerous occasions。
[Speaker 1]:  this trick of his was like a little magic show performed by a playboy trying to ford with women to put it blindly ly in mathetatics。
[Speaker 1]:  he was in nobody，
[Speaker 1]:  but in social circles with lower intellectual barriers，
[Speaker 1]:  but higher social status。
[Speaker 1]:  he was a genious capable of intellectually overpowing others if he still don't understand，
[Speaker 1]:  think about whthere are so many celebrities in the entertainment industry，
[Speaker 1]:  who barely cored five hundred on the college entrance exam，
[Speaker 1]:  barely getting into a top tier university where are constantly praised as academigenuuthe reason is simple。
[Speaker 1]:  they're playing a rigg game。
[Speaker 1]:  in fact，
[Speaker 1]:  several important turning points in epsteen's life were related to this social performance。
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  his entry into teaching，
[Speaker 1]:  a dolton school was considered an incredible security loople by former colleagues。
[Speaker 1]:  how could someone with no degree，
[Speaker 1]:  no teaching certificate and no teaching experience，
[Speaker 1]:  get a job teaching mathematics and physics that one of the best private schools in new york。
[Speaker 1]:  this level of absurdity is comparable to the story of middle school student leohowand new oriental。
[Speaker 1]:  according to later recollections。
[Speaker 1]:  during his interview，
[Speaker 1]:  he didn't talk about how to teach children or how to write lelesson plans。
[Speaker 1]:  instead，
[Speaker 1]:  he directly derive mathematical formulas on the blackboard and performed a mental calculation on the spot。
[Speaker 1]:  in short，
[Speaker 1]:  he acted like mad damin's character in the movie goowill hunting，
[Speaker 1]:  a corkey arrogant mathematical genius。
[Speaker 1]:  this performance completely conquered the headmaster。
[Speaker 1]:  think about it，
[Speaker 1]:  don't we usually have some stereotypical impressions and fantasies about genius。
[Speaker 1]:  when we watch movies and TV shows，
[Speaker 1]:  we always feel that the regular education system is too rigid，
[Speaker 1]:  and it only those were in artitilate unrestrained，
[Speaker 1]:  and who can calculate the square root of seven hundred fifty nine off hand。
[Speaker 1]:  and more importantly，
[Speaker 1]:  those who drop out of school are the real genuses。
[Speaker 1]:  this performance of his perfectly matches，
[Speaker 1]:  the kind of genius portrayed movies and tv shows if they didn't hire him，
[Speaker 1]:  wouldn't they risk him being poached by competitors getting into doltin was just the first step in esteen's plan。
[Speaker 1]:  his plan with something like like，
[Speaker 1]:  i'm still still a poor guy。
[Speaker 1]:  i can't access the powerful and influential people in high society，
[Speaker 1]:  but their children are all adullin with my persona as a mathematical genius，
[Speaker 1]:  getting these kids to recognize and admirme and building trust with them is a piece of k when they kikids through the the family business and become members of parliament or ministers，
[Speaker 1]:  who will they turn to for advice？
[Speaker 1]:  of course，
[Speaker 1]:  it will be made。
[Speaker 1]:  what is this called？
[Speaker 1]:  this is called the succession plan，
[Speaker 1]:  epsteen's genius，
[Speaker 1]:  lay and seen through the weakness。
[Speaker 1]:  so the men had an elite educational anxiety，
[Speaker 1]:  no matter how rich you are，
[Speaker 1]:  you always hope your children can learn from the smartest people，
[Speaker 1]:  and his job was to package himself，
[Speaker 1]:  as that smartest person in his classes。
[Speaker 1]:  he didn't play by the rules，
[Speaker 1]:  often talking about quantum physics and financial logic，
[Speaker 1]:  leaving those second generkids ds willder when these children went home and told their wall street mobile fathers that their new math teacher was practically in alien。
[Speaker 1]:  his fish was hooked。
[Speaker 1]:  in fact，
[Speaker 1]:  estinin's succession plan went quite smooly。
[Speaker 1]:  after after two years years，
[Speaker 1]:  teaching a dolphin high school，
[Speaker 1]:  he moved to the financial industry，
[Speaker 1]:  working as a trader at beare stones，
[Speaker 1]:  providing investment device，
[Speaker 1]:  specifically the high net worth clients。
[Speaker 1]:  the chairman of the company was the father of one of his students from dolphin。
[Speaker 1]:  fifteen years later，
[Speaker 1]:  he not only became a partner at bear sterns，
[Speaker 1]:  but also found found his own financial company managing assets worth over one billion dollars。
[Speaker 1]:  with this eptime made brililant transformation completing a clasassent that neither his family nor the previous two generations had achieved。
[Speaker 1]:  in fact，
[Speaker 1]:  i theme countless people，
[Speaker 1]:  similar ep，
[Speaker 1]:  stein when i was in beijing ing，
[Speaker 1]:  you can call them on on artists，
[Speaker 1]:  or you can call them fixers。
[Speaker 1]:  their common characteristic is that their mysterious seemingly without any extraordinary professional skills。
[Speaker 1]:  they are not experts in any field，
[Speaker 1]:  nor do they have any outstanding achievements。
[Speaker 1]:  they only do one thing every day attending receptions parties，
[Speaker 1]:  fashion shows charity dinners and social events uphaistically called resource integration。
[Speaker 1]:  regarding this one of estents，
[Speaker 1]:  former clients chicago 等于一一 business manststrrowho later ursued him for business disputes described this way，
[Speaker 1]:  you can't get any definite information from esteine。
[Speaker 1]:  he always acts very mysterious。
[Speaker 1]:  everyone who was associated with him thinks he is incredibly smart，
[Speaker 1]:  but i have never seen any evidence of his intelligence nor have ever seen him work。
[Speaker 1]:  quote，
[Speaker 1]:  the wealthy people。
[Speaker 1]:  i know similar to him would rather work twenty six hours a day，
[Speaker 1]:  while this guy spends all twenty six hours eating drinking and having fun from this perspective，
[Speaker 1]:  epstin。
[Speaker 1]:  and that so called she gun master，
[Speaker 1]:  wa NGLIN are essentially the same kind of people。
[Speaker 1]:  some might be curious，
[Speaker 1]:  saying it's just a social gathering or the wealthy。
[Speaker 1]:  so skill involved。
[Speaker 1]:  i'm also quite sociable。
[Speaker 1]:  i can easily gather a bunch of people when i go back to my hometown for class reunions，
[Speaker 1]:  but you have to understand that kind of social networking involves a group of people who are already familiar with each other。
[Speaker 1]:  you just need to be a little sociable，
[Speaker 1]:  make a few phone calls and get some likes on social media to organize a gathering，
[Speaker 1]:  but professional social connectors，
[Speaker 1]:  especially top tier ones like epstein are different。
[Speaker 1]:  their job is to bring together a group of people from all over the world who are already at the top of the pyamid of potential and wealth。
[Speaker 1]:  to do this，
[Speaker 1]:  you have to cater to their interests，
[Speaker 1]:  understand their desires and give them what they want。
[Speaker 1]:  so what exactly do these wealthy people want。
[Speaker 1]:  let me at a point here are daily social activities or gatherings usually have a legitimate reason，
[Speaker 1]:  even something noble or mysterious，
[Speaker 1]:  a pretext or a fasson。
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  it's my birthday of the weeks。
[Speaker 1]:  ers are tenure graduation anniversary。
[Speaker 1]:  the teachers sk，
[Speaker 1]:  let's go visit him。
[Speaker 1]:  the same applies to the circle of the wealthy。
[Speaker 1]:  they just prefer to use big words because they aren't necessary ily nevermates，
[Speaker 1]:  so they have to find issues that everyone pretends to care about as a pretext，
[Speaker 1]:  such as charity，
[Speaker 1]:  science，
[Speaker 1]:  summits，
[Speaker 1]:  physics，
[Speaker 1]:  seminars。
[Speaker 1]:  and so on。
[Speaker 1]:  this is why abstin then funded a group of top scientists，
[Speaker 1]:  including hawking and invited them to his island。
[Speaker 1]:  the presence of these people is used to add prestige to the events。
[Speaker 1]:  the wealthy circle in the US is relatively abdued。
[Speaker 1]:  they still talk about things with you，
[Speaker 1]:  but similar events in china，
[Speaker 1]:  such as the famous hainin rondavl，
[Speaker 1]:  are often much more straightforward directly showcasing yachts，
[Speaker 1]:  private jets and rereal estate。
[Speaker 1]:  but a mere pretext isn't enough，
[Speaker 1]:  such also need sufficient social capital。
[Speaker 1]:  in other words，
[Speaker 1]:  something to peak the interest of the attendees，
[Speaker 1]:  epstein found his first form of social capital connections across industry resource networking，
[Speaker 1]:  even top tier letes have their own cognitive and social blind spots。
[Speaker 1]:  those in finance want to know where the next big trend is how advancsday i is and whether it's just a bubble，
[Speaker 1]:  those in technology want to know the political climate in the future direction of US china relations。
[Speaker 1]:  those in politics want to know which wealthy individuals will support their campaigns。
[Speaker 1]:  and whether their opponents have any dirt that can be used against them，
[Speaker 1]:  of course，
[Speaker 1]:  epstin understood very well。
[Speaker 1]:  the connections built solely their quid pro coo or flimsy and easily broken to make these battle hardened cold blooded and said offsh alallow big shots truly ban together。
[Speaker 1]:  you have to deploy a second even more powerful social currency，
[Speaker 1]:  sex，
[Speaker 1]:  using sex as a lubricant in social circles is actually quite common。
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  when a group of men are women go out for karaoke，
[Speaker 1]:  don't they usually invite a members of the opposite sex？
[Speaker 1]:  you really see all male or all female groups，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  like this，
[Speaker 2]:  let's kill a few people，
[Speaker 2]:  let's kill you。
[Speaker 2]:  you o of course，
[Speaker 1]:  what absteine provided was far more than just introducing a few girls。
[Speaker 1]:  it was a whole set of social solutions。
[Speaker 1]:  some might say，
[Speaker 1]:  isn't it just providing sexual services，
[Speaker 1]:  sexual entertainment？
[Speaker 1]:  this kind of thing is rampant in china，
[Speaker 1]:  where in the country doesn't have a handed dance troopp。
[Speaker 1]:  quote，
[Speaker 1]:  what's so special about that？
[Speaker 1]:  a social soluif，
[Speaker 1]:  you put it that way。
[Speaker 1]:  maybe。
[Speaker 1]:  so 对对，
[Speaker 1]:  but the laleda island thing is actually quite rare in the united states。
[Speaker 1]:  first，
[Speaker 1]:  let me ask you two questions。
[Speaker 1]:  first，
[Speaker 1]:  why did upstein go to such links to include underage girls？
[Speaker 1]:  among the girls，
[Speaker 1]:  he provided for sexual entertainment from the information currently disclosed，
[Speaker 1]:  the service of providing undergrage girls was initially proposed by abstein himself，
[Speaker 1]:  not by the so called these girts，
[Speaker 1]:  you should know that the united states is it like china，
[Speaker 1]:  where you can just find ganggers ers human traffickers to kidnap in a bunch of girls chain them up and lock them in a basement。
[Speaker 1]:  according to the currently disclosed information，
[Speaker 1]:  he mainly control these girls using financial entire in psychological manipulation，
[Speaker 1]:  not diredireviviolfor for examhe。
[Speaker 1]:  he send people to scouout ggirls imimpovershfamilies are those whose parents were drug adticicand in in need money，
[Speaker 1]:  then provide financial assistance and subsequently manipulate these girls。
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  he would would invein in our sponors or called modeling agencies，
[Speaker 1]:  finding youngirls from eastern europeans from south american countries who dreamed of becoming supermodels，
[Speaker 1]:  and his girl friend in partner would provide emotional support。
[Speaker 1]:  secondly，
[Speaker 1]:  why did he go to a remote island thousands of miles away to conduct his entertainment instead of staying in a mention in the US mainland，
[Speaker 1]:  such as in new yorker，
[Speaker 1]:  less angeles anywhere would be fine，
[Speaker 1]:  considering both methods caused very little money。
[Speaker 1]:  let's answer the first question。
[Speaker 1]:  first，
[Speaker 1]:  the marxist scholar jjac once proposed the concept of obseen cohesion，
[Speaker 1]:  meaning that the true cohese of force within any seemingly noble and righteous power organization does not come from the honners and rules displayed on the walls，
[Speaker 1]:  but rather from a certain shared secret among members that cannot be brought to the surface，
[Speaker 1]:  but rather be illegal or against regulations。
[Speaker 1]:  chinese people often say that the strongest meltbones are formed by fighting together in battle，
[Speaker 1]:  sharing hardships to gether and horing together。
[Speaker 1]:  the first two are easy to understand facing life and death together and sharing hardships together。
[Speaker 1]:  but the third one seems a bit difficult to understand horing together。
[Speaker 1]:  this is clearly a stain on one's character，
[Speaker 1]:  but precisely，
[Speaker 1]:  because this shared stain，
[Speaker 1]:  the two conform a closer alliance，
[Speaker 1]:  because you have my weakness，
[Speaker 1]:  and i have yours。
[Speaker 1]:  there's no need to worry about mutual betrayal。
[Speaker 1]:  we'll die together if necessary。
[Speaker 1]:  there are two examples of this kind of obsemed solidarity that are most familiar to chinese people。
[Speaker 1]:  one is the requirement in the water lgin people。
[Speaker 1]:  those those inining lengshoon to commit a similar at killing a random passerby before were being admitted chenkeiga's film，
[Speaker 1]:  the king of masks，
[Speaker 1]:  also depics this。
[Speaker 1]:  secondly，
[Speaker 1]:  there's the common corruption in officialdom。
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 3]:  if you don't take bribes，
[Speaker 3]:  how can i if i don't take bribes，
[Speaker 3]:  how can you if you and i don't take bribes，
[Speaker 3]:  how can we get promoted？
[Speaker 1]:  quote understanding these points，
[Speaker 1]:  you can understand why epstin spend heavily on recruiting and promoting underage girls。
[Speaker 1]:  because if they were just ordinary girls，
[Speaker 1]:  the power of this kind of abscine solidarity would be limited，
[Speaker 1]:  even if exposed，
[Speaker 1]:  it would only be considered prostitution，
[Speaker 1]:  which，
[Speaker 1]:  while damaging to reputation，
[Speaker 1]:  wouldn't be a major problem。
[Speaker 1]:  trump previously paid for sex，
[Speaker 1]:  whether with prostitutes or extrameital affairs，
[Speaker 1]:  did you get impeach or step down because of it with impage girls are completely different。
[Speaker 1]:  this is a crime，
[Speaker 1]:  especially if you're a celebrity。
[Speaker 1]:  this is equivalent to completely handing over your weaknesses to each other。
[Speaker 1]:  how could relationship should not be reliable？
[Speaker 1]:  why did you have to go to a deserted island thousands of miles away？
[Speaker 1]:  aren't there are plenty of places to buy sex in the US mainland，
[Speaker 1]:  some are even legal，
[Speaker 1]:  because these people are all big figures in the united states。
[Speaker 1]:  let's assume that if trumer mosque were feeling arrogant and wanted to have some fun，
[Speaker 1]:  would they dare to go to loss vegas if they did？
[Speaker 1]:  and someone recognized them？
[Speaker 1]:  would they say mister trump，
[Speaker 1]:  could you give me an autograph？
[Speaker 1]:  i'm your biggest fan，
[Speaker 1]:  i voted for you twice，
[Speaker 1]:  and i'll get you some ammy emotional。
[Speaker 1]:  underwhere later，
[Speaker 1]:  i guarantee you'be surprised twice or mister ask my twitter account was suspended because i was trolling。
[Speaker 1]:  could you help me on blocket or give you a discount？
[Speaker 1]:  quote？
[Speaker 1]:  see，
[Speaker 1]:  that's the trouble with celebrities。
[Speaker 1]:  they get recognized wherever they go，
[Speaker 1]:  and they have to worry about the other person blabbing afterwards，
[Speaker 1]:  even if they pay them off，
[Speaker 1]:  didn't trump get betrayed by that women who admitted to the affair？
[Speaker 1]:  and even if the woman of media say anything，
[Speaker 1]:  there will still be a bunch of media reporters and poparparozi watching，
[Speaker 1]:  and they could be ruined if they're not careful。
[Speaker 1]:  this kind of trouble is completely nonexistent in china in china。
[Speaker 1]:  only small powless celebrities get exexposed by media。
[Speaker 1]:  if you're official even just a county head or a town mayor going out to buy a prostitute，
[Speaker 1]:  even a minor，
[Speaker 1]:  unless you yourself are fallen from power and been arrested。
[Speaker 1]:  no media outlet would dare to reported，
[Speaker 1]:  and no police officer would dare to rescue you not only have absolute power in your own jurisdiction，
[Speaker 1]:  but even if you go to another area and cause trouble，
[Speaker 1]:  the local officials will help you cover it up to maintain the dignity of the party in the country。
[Speaker 1]:  don't believe me me about it。
[Speaker 1]:  it。
[Speaker 1]:  chinese media occasionally exposed news involving prostitution，
[Speaker 1]:  but which ones were exposed before the officials themselves were taken down。
[Speaker 1]:  weren't，
[Speaker 1]:  they all duve up after they were already confirmed to be arrested。
[Speaker 1]:  so from the perspective of doing bad things，
[Speaker 1]:  these wealthy people in the united states are actually quite pitiful。
[Speaker 1]:  no matter how rich you are or how higher status you're constantly being watched in the united states，
[Speaker 1]:  only by taking a private jeet to avoid all the media reporters，
[Speaker 1]:  nose neighghbors and passes by and hiding on a remote island where even ghosts can't be found。
[Speaker 1]:  can you have some semples of privacy to do bad things？
[Speaker 1]:  this is what i said on twitter before why se epsteins so famous，
[Speaker 1]:  because his clients are famous for being the top figures in the country。
[Speaker 1]:  so why are these top figures so dependent on epstein because the services he provides our extremely scarce in the united states or in the western world。
[Speaker 1]:  why can't china produce an upstein because it's too common place any person who engages in so called business networking and ask you if you want to go to a clubor or karaaoke bar can provide a full range of services。
[Speaker 1]:  don't even mention youyou on musk，
[Speaker 1]:  even the sun of a village head can make a fortune just by hanging out in a nighkler for while even even the business part of a private room manager will bring an income。
[Speaker 1]:  don't even talk about business karaoke。
[Speaker 1]:  aren't there often people posting spam and escorts service information in the common section to my youtube videos？
[Speaker 1]:  if you're curious，
[Speaker 1]:  send a message to this aussie and ask，
[Speaker 1]:  do you have any young girone one percent？
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  this is the difference in national conditions。
[Speaker 1]:  this is like in japan，
[Speaker 1]:  where a group of people misappropriating tens of thousands of RMB in campaign funds for eating drinincan wake headlines，
[Speaker 1]:  and then a bunch of people come running to china to criticize japan for corruption，
[Speaker 1]:  saying the japan is doomed in its democrat systems。
[Speaker 1]:  finished，
[Speaker 0]: 你看。
[Speaker 1]:  going back to some details of the abstein case，
[Speaker 1]:  including how it was exposed in two thousand five，
[Speaker 1]:  a woman contacted to ford，
[Speaker 1]:  a police，
[Speaker 1]:  saying that her fourteen old prostitutive daughter was taken to esteen's place by slightly older girl and performed stripping in massage for him after receiving three hundred dollars because it involved a minor。
[Speaker 1]:  the police subsequently conducted in eleven month undundercored investigation of abstein in search his residents afterward，
[Speaker 1]:  the FBI also got involved based on investigations of five girls and seventeams swarnn testimonies as well as high school transcripts and photos of girls found in esteens trash can。
[Speaker 1]:  it was revealed that some of the girl those were still high school students when they had relations with him。
[Speaker 1]:  these materials completely overturned absteen's defence that he didn't know。
[Speaker 1]:  they were minors，
[Speaker 1]:  then dozens of media outlets，
[Speaker 1]:  including the miami herald and the international business times，
[Speaker 1]:  launched a massive attack。
[Speaker 1]:  inclualprinate reports ts tetemonmones led to ininvolvement several al profilile figures，
[Speaker 1]:  including prince andrew of the UK，
[Speaker 1]:  former US president bill clinton and bill gates。
[Speaker 1]:  this sparked a public outcry 对不对？
[Speaker 1]:  but then the situation change in june two thousand eight，
[Speaker 1]:  epstein pleaded guilty to the charges against him，
[Speaker 1]:  including one count of soliciting prostitution，
[Speaker 1]:  and one count of soliciting prostitution from a minor。
[Speaker 1]:  this was in exchange for prosecutors not pursuing federal charges against him in a sentence of only eighteen months in prison。
[Speaker 1]:  some might wonder how could abstein after coming so many offences get such a light punishment with just a plea deal？
[Speaker 1]:  let me explain briefly him。
[Speaker 1]:  abstein actually exploited a look pole in the american legal system called the plea puniining mechanism。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  you heard that right？
[Speaker 1]:  american courts can bargain simply put over ninety percent of criminal cases in the us are resolve through plea，
[Speaker 1]:  bargaining or pleading。
[Speaker 1]:  and never even reach a jury trial。
[Speaker 1]:  basically，
[Speaker 1]:  the prosecutor and the defendants lawyer sit down in top the oriknows ws guilty ty of，
[Speaker 1]:  and a ququiitle is unlikely。
[Speaker 1]:  but to save everyone time，
[Speaker 1]:  you to aded guilty to some charges to drop some charges，
[Speaker 1]:  and you get a lighter sentence，
[Speaker 1]:  saving the government judicial resources。
[Speaker 1]:  if a deal is reached，
[Speaker 1]:  we sign in agreement。
[Speaker 1]:  the original intention behind this system is very practical to prevent the collapse of the judicial system。
[Speaker 1]:  the american legal system has very strict requirements for evidence。
[Speaker 1]:  you can't just rely on a confession or recovered memories to secure a conviction。
[Speaker 1]:  it's not impossible，
[Speaker 1]:  but it's relatively rare。
[Speaker 1]:  in empsteen's case。
[Speaker 1]:  you can't just say i had a relationship with this wealthy and powerful person and expect them to be arrested in convicted。
[Speaker 1]:  there must be concrete evidence，
[Speaker 1]:  such as extrted，
[Speaker 1]:  ted，
[Speaker 1]:  mman，
[Speaker 1]:  dda and proproof the exacact time incident occurred and that you were indeed，
[Speaker 1]:  under eighteen at the time。
[Speaker 1]:  this is why rape is so difficult to prosecute because unless the perpetrator is caught in the act or the girlsecretly hiit condoms in semon。
[Speaker 1]:  inquietly went to the police station the next day to report the crime。
[Speaker 1]:  the case is very difficult to make。
[Speaker 1]:  estein was arrested in in thousand thousand five，
[Speaker 1]:  and most of the accusations involving those powerful figures occurred in the ninenineteen nineties at that time，
[Speaker 1]:  technology wasn't as advanced as it is today，
[Speaker 1]:  and the girls were unable to preserve evidence immediately，
[Speaker 1]:  making it difficult to convict。
[Speaker 1]:  most of the accused。
[Speaker 1]:  this is also why epsteen's island made those powerful figures feel a sense of privacy in this situation ation。
[Speaker 1]:  if the prosecution continue the investigation，
[Speaker 1]:  the greatest possibility was that they would spend a huge amount of manpower。
[Speaker 1]:  and resources，
[Speaker 1]:  but ultimately fail togather enough evidence to convict those powerful figures it。
[Speaker 1]:  it was better to plead guilty and accept a lighter sentence。
[Speaker 1]:  it should be pointed out that the reason abstein himself pleaded guilty was because the fourteen old girls who suit him in two thousand five reported the case three days after the incident，
[Speaker 1]:  and the evidence was relatively solid。
[Speaker 1]:  if the time ellapse was too long，
[Speaker 1]:  it would likely be impossible to convict him。
[Speaker 1]:  unfortunately，
[Speaker 1]:  the location of the incident provided by this fourteen year old girl was not the leadined island，
[Speaker 1]:  but absteenes mention in pomb beach per accusation did not include any of the powerful clients mentioned above，
[Speaker 1]:  but was limited to abstein himself。
[Speaker 1]:  as for the vast majority of accusation against those powerfifires res，
[Speaker 1]:  there is only indirect evidence，
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  photos conficated by the police from estinenhome home repords of emails exchange between empinin。
[Speaker 1]:  in those people，
[Speaker 1]:  the famous little black book，
[Speaker 1]:  which contained the contact information of thousands of business and political figures around the world，
[Speaker 1]:  and this is clearly far from enough to secure a conviction。
[Speaker 1]:  now we come to the part that everyone is most concerned about which people on the widely circulated online list of so called celebrities actually participated，
[Speaker 1]:  which ones are questionable，
[Speaker 1]:  and which ones are clerely fabricated。
[Speaker 1]:  let's discuss them one by one leme clarify two things。
[Speaker 1]:  first，
[Speaker 1]:  the first is how that so called loleda island list，
[Speaker 1]:  which contains thousands of people and seems to include half of the western upper class，
[Speaker 1]:  came about note that the following information is accurate information verified by official sources and reported by the media，
[Speaker 1]:  not mere rumors。
[Speaker 1]:  first of all，
[Speaker 1]:  there is no official list of all lelethe island clients published by the government，
[Speaker 1]:  and the department of justice has never released anything called the client list，
[Speaker 1]:  a sex trafficking list or AVIP client list。
[Speaker 1]:  those list that make your blood boil list that seemingly include everyone are basically a hodgepodge of information cobled together and exaggerated by netiises self media accounts and conspiracy theorists over the past few lihow。
[Speaker 1]:  were they created there，
[Speaker 1]:  roughly three sources。
[Speaker 1]:  first，
[Speaker 1]:  there's the so called black book，
[Speaker 1]:  which is the contact list。
[Speaker 1]:  the police found from epten's home containing approximately fifteen hundred to two thousand names and phone numbers，
[Speaker 1]:  including many celebrities，
[Speaker 1]:  former presidents，
[Speaker 1]:  billionairres scientists，
[Speaker 1]:  stars and politicians。
[Speaker 1]:  but node，
[Speaker 1]:  this is just a contact list。
[Speaker 1]:  there are no markings indicating that any VIP clients visited the island or receive money。
[Speaker 1]:  in other words，
[Speaker 1]:  it's completely different from what you might imagine a list of high ranking officials who received sexual services from miners and were recorded a phones。
[Speaker 1]:  contact list might sometimes include entries like baby or x boyfriend，
[Speaker 1]:  but this contact list doesn't have any such markings。
[Speaker 1]:  keep in mind that estein was a professional social climate。
[Speaker 1]:  his job was to cultivate relationships with the powerful and wealthy。
[Speaker 1]:  he recorded almost everyone。
[Speaker 1]:  he knew wanted to know，
[Speaker 1]:  was introduced to attended his parties or donated money to him。
[Speaker 1]:  he probably never even met many of the people on the list。
[Speaker 1]:  this is why so many female celebrities appear on the list。
[Speaker 1]:  the actual relevance of this list is probably less than five percent。
[Speaker 1]:  secondly，
[Speaker 1]:  there are the flight logs from aplities teams private jeet that the police seized，
[Speaker 1]:  which detailed names of passengers，
[Speaker 1]:  departure times origins and destations ations list also includes many celebrities。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  this list also also has problem fying ying on his plane。
[Speaker 1]:  esn't mean an went to the lilid island。
[Speaker 1]:  and even if you went to the island，
[Speaker 1]:  it doesn't mean you participated in an orgy。
[Speaker 1]:  thirdly，
[Speaker 1]:  there are the people mentioned in the litigation documents。
[Speaker 1]:  this list is also very unreliable because even if des names mentioned in emails as well as names of celebrities that epsteine casually mentioned when his lawyquesquestion icictims，
[Speaker 1]:  but this is unrelated to the alleged sexual assaululcase。
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  one female witness in the epin in ase es named showbog，
[Speaker 1]:  he explicitly mentioned in his twenty sixteen court testimony that epstein particularly like to show off his connections with many celebrities。
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  when he answer the phone，
[Speaker 1]:  he would often say that the person on the other end was leanardo to caabrio bruce willous or kate blenched。
[Speaker 1]:  he never actually saw these celebrities while working there，
[Speaker 1]:  absteine would only boast about them after hanging up the phone。
[Speaker 1]:  so who knows if it was true？
[Speaker 1]:  but simply because these names were mentioned during the trial，
[Speaker 1]:  they were inexplicitably added to the list。
[Speaker 1]:  the fourth，
[Speaker 1]:  in most aggreegeous point is pure fabrication。
[Speaker 1]:  many people would add the names of celebrities they dislike，
[Speaker 1]:  or those who have nothing to do with abstein to the online list，
[Speaker 1]:  mixing them with legitimate names。
[Speaker 1]:  combining these four points results in the increasingly blooated list，
[Speaker 1]:  we see now with the truth，
[Speaker 1]:  completely buried in a sea of rumors，
[Speaker 1]:  making it difficult to distinguish fact from fiction。
[Speaker 1]:  secondly，
[Speaker 1]:  what exactly do those three million pages of documents that have been release contained many people here，
[Speaker 1]:  three million pages that think it's terrifying，
[Speaker 1]:  wondering how many victims there must be and how dark america is。
[Speaker 1]:  this is a common narrative used in the simplify chinese speaking world。
[Speaker 1]:  it praise on the fact that most ordinary people don't have the time to verify everything。
[Speaker 1]:  but if you look closely，
[Speaker 1]:  you'll find the information density of these so called three million pages of documents is actually very low。
[Speaker 1]:  simply put，
[Speaker 1]:  these materials are mainly divided into three categies first category，
[Speaker 1]:  a which includes highly credible materials，
[Speaker 1]:  such as official records，
[Speaker 1]:  legal recorments and physical evidence。
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  the flight loggs mentioned earlier are the most solid and unchangeable evidence。
[Speaker 1]:  another example is the various documents seas by the police from his home in two thousand and five incluvvarious ias materials，
[Speaker 1]:  computer hard，
[Speaker 1]:  drives photos in surveillance，
[Speaker 1]:  camera layouts，
[Speaker 1]:  then there are escenes and others bank statements and financial agreements such as transactions with the victorious secret owner。
[Speaker 1]:  it's eta a this part accounts for the smalst st proportion，
[Speaker 1]:  but is the most substantive。
[Speaker 1]:  secondly，
[Speaker 1]:  there is category b，
[Speaker 1]:  which includes materials with moderate credibility，
[Speaker 1]:  including swren temonmonies of those involved in correspondence emails，
[Speaker 1]:  the email records that have been discussed extensively recently mostly belong to this category。
[Speaker 1]:  this part does not account for a high proportion either。
[Speaker 1]:  finally，
[Speaker 1]:  there is category sea，
[Speaker 1]:  which has the lowest credibility，
[Speaker 1]:  including one，
[Speaker 1]:  including anonymous reports and hot line calls。
[Speaker 1]:  after the absteined case broke，
[Speaker 1]:  the FBI released a hot line number to solicit information from the public。
[Speaker 1]:  they received a large number of calls from ordinary citizens，
[Speaker 1]:  many of whom made a relevant statement，
[Speaker 1]:  such as my neighbor，
[Speaker 1]:  looks like stetime，
[Speaker 1]:  or i suspect my classmax x boyfrien's neighbor went a little same james island，
[Speaker 1]:  most of the three million documents we mentioned today fall into the third category。
[Speaker 1]:  okay，
[Speaker 1]:  background information is complete。
[Speaker 1]:  now let's get to the main point，
[Speaker 1]:  which of those high profile names have concrete evidence against them，
[Speaker 1]:  which are based on rumors and which are perely innocent and dragged into the case。
[Speaker 1]:  first is briprinandrew，
[Speaker 1]:  the forforbrititiprprinwho has has been cused mumultiple times。
[Speaker 1]:  the girl who accuhim is virginia。
[Speaker 1]:  jejeffrey remember this name as she will appear multiple times later，
[Speaker 1]:  virginia was born in august，
[Speaker 1]:  one thousand and eighty three。
[Speaker 1]:  she also has photos of herself with andrew and maxwell。
[Speaker 1]:  according to her testimony，
[Speaker 1]:  he was first introduced andrew by estinggirlfriend and partner maxwell around march two thousand one。
[Speaker 1]:  the meeting took place in london and based on the timine，
[Speaker 1]:  he was seventeen years old at the time。
[Speaker 0]: 我有不不的。
[Speaker 0]: 是的，
[Speaker 1]:  she emphasized this point in multiple public interviews，
[Speaker 1]:  testimonies and swren statements saying that when they first met andrew，
[Speaker 1]:  even played an age game with her，
[Speaker 1]:  and immediately guess she was seventeen saying，
[Speaker 1]:  my daughter is only a little younger than you。
[Speaker 1]:  virginia also described。
[Speaker 1]:  andrew is friendly enough，
[Speaker 1]:  but still arrogant believing that having sexual relations with her was his birth thright ultimately in twenty twenty two virginia and prince。
[Speaker 1]:  andrew reached out of court settlement with a latter paying millions of dollars in compensation in subsequently losing his royal title。
[Speaker 1]:  this means that although the evidence wasn't conclusive，
[Speaker 1]:  it's equivalent u。
[Speaker 1]:  an admission of guilt next，
[Speaker 1]:  this former US president bill clinton，
[Speaker 1]:  because the monaricle luinsky scandal clinton is considered a notorious woman izer。
[Speaker 1]:  so when absteine was exposed in his name was mentioned，
[Speaker 1]:  most people immediately assumed he was a pedophile。
[Speaker 1]:  jokingly saying，
[Speaker 1]:  that's his reputation，
[Speaker 1]:  but i have to say clinton suspicion in this matter might not be that solid first flight loggs released by the department of justice show that clinton took esteems private jeet twenty six times。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  all these trips took place between two thousand and two and two thousand free。
[Speaker 1]:  after proleft，
[Speaker 1]:  the presidency，
[Speaker 1]:  public reports indicate that these trips were for public and charitable activities to promote the clinton foundation，
[Speaker 1]:  not private travel。
[Speaker 1]:  it's worth noting that these twenty six trips actually referred to twenty six flight legs，
[Speaker 1]:  a long trip often includes multiple legs。
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  africa trip in september，
[Speaker 1]:  two thousand two involved flying from the US dagha then to nigeria ventrwanda mozambic，
[Speaker 1]:  south africa and the UK eleven legs in total。
[Speaker 1]:  so twenty six trips might seem like a lot，
[Speaker 1]:  but it actually amounts only four major trips。
[Speaker 1]:  further more。
[Speaker 1]:  none of the destinations for these twenty six legs were a little same。
[Speaker 1]:  james island。
[Speaker 1]:  some might ask，
[Speaker 1]:  if that's the case，
[Speaker 1]:  why did he use absteen's private jet？
[Speaker 1]:  first？
[Speaker 1]:  stly epinine was a donor to the clinton foundation，
[Speaker 1]:  although dondonation was not laronly only twenty five thousand dollars。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  using a private jet is also often consider a form of donation。
[Speaker 1]:  secondly，
[Speaker 1]:  everyone knows that the US president travels on air force one while in office。
[Speaker 1]:  but what about after leaving office without a dedicated plane，
[Speaker 1]:  the government requires former presidents to still maintain strict security。
[Speaker 1]:  this means they either travel on a friends，
[Speaker 1]:  private jet or take commercial flights buying separate tickets for security personnel since the latter is inconvenient and less secure。
[Speaker 1]:  former presidents，
[Speaker 1]:  especially during official，
[Speaker 1]:  trips often rely on wealthy friends for private jet travel。
[Speaker 1]:  is it possible that he travelled to little same james island on someone else's private jeet or yet it's possible，
[Speaker 1]:  but there are two problems here。
[Speaker 1]:  first，
[Speaker 1]:  clinton receives lifelong security protection from the white house wherever he goes，
[Speaker 1]:  even on private trips security personneler with him twenty four hours a day。
[Speaker 1]:  this means that if he went a little same james island，
[Speaker 1]:  the security personnel would know。
[Speaker 1]:  but so far，
[Speaker 1]:  no former security personnel has come forward to the media to reveal this information。
[Speaker 1]:  next，
[Speaker 1]:  the a four mentioned virginia jeffrey who only had a brief encounter with prince andrew mentioned in an interview with the british sunday mail in twenty eleven that she saw clinton from a distance on epinin's island in two thousand one or two thousand two。
[Speaker 1]:  she asked abstein what clinton was doing there，
[Speaker 1]:  and the latter only replied that he owed him a favor，
[Speaker 1]:  but did not ask her to accompany clinton throughout the entire process。
[Speaker 1]:  she did not see clinton interacting with any girls。
[Speaker 1]:  furthermore，
[Speaker 1]:  these claims are entirely based on jefrefree's world testimony without any physical evidence such as photos。
[Speaker 1]:  this means that at least in the upstein case，
[Speaker 1]:  there is currently no evidence to prove the clinton engaged in any improper behavior。
[Speaker 1]:  then there's bill gates。
[Speaker 1]:  this former richest man in the world is almost the most heavily criticized person on the simplified chinese internet because of the epinin island incident，
[Speaker 1]:  but i must say that the possibility of him participying in the esteine island incident is basically zero。
[Speaker 1]:  why？
[Speaker 1]:  because gates only appeared on empten's private plane log once on march first twenty thirteen，
[Speaker 1]:  flying from new jersey to florida。
[Speaker 1]:  this was years after abstein was investigated by the police in two thousand five for the estein island incident insentenced in two thousand eight。
[Speaker 1]:  furthermore，
[Speaker 1]:  according to their email records，
[Speaker 1]:  the two only met for the first time on january thirty first toeleven，
[Speaker 1]:  and epsten's mentioned in manhattan due the matters related to the gate's foundation in twenty fourteen。
[Speaker 1]:  gates realized that epsten's reputation was too bad in my dragon down，
[Speaker 1]:  so he chose to severatities before that the two had never had any interaction，
[Speaker 1]:  no email exchanges，
[Speaker 1]:  no photos together，
[Speaker 1]:  and no media reports about any private involvement。
[Speaker 1]:  gates 's private life may indeed have some questionable aspects，
[Speaker 1]:  but to say that he participated in the abstein island activities is truly unfair to him next to the even more bizarre case of stephen hawking and michael jackson regarding hawking，
[Speaker 1]:  this is another example of mindlest criticism on the simplified chinese internet。
[Speaker 1]:  many people exhaimed in surprise。
[Speaker 1]:  after seeing this photo saying that even hawking had fallen victim，
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  the truth is that this photo was taken in march two thousand six when he was invited to attend a scientific workshop on quantum gravity sponsored by upstein。
[Speaker 1]:  the media has also reported publicly that abstein frequently sponsored academic events to enhance his image and expand his network。
[Speaker 1]:  the meeting was held on same thomas island near a little same james island，
[Speaker 1]:  and this island did not belong to abstein during the conference。
[Speaker 1]:  break。
[Speaker 1]:  epstein invited many scientists，
[Speaker 1]:  including hawking to briefly visit his little same james island for a bararbecue dinner，
[Speaker 1]:  after which this photo was taken of the three man in the photo。
[Speaker 1]:  besides hawking，
[Speaker 1]:  the man in the backrow is a theoretical physicifrom princeton and a recipient of two thousand four nobel prize in physics，
[Speaker 1]:  david growth。
[Speaker 1]:  the man in the front row was also a prominent figure。
[Speaker 1]:  his name is kipped thorn，
[Speaker 1]:  colleague and friend end hahaking king after a recipient of the twenty seventeen nobel prize in physics。
[Speaker 1]:  the woman in lower right corner is lisa randall，
[Speaker 1]:  also a harvard theoreticical physicist and one of the top physicists of our time。
[Speaker 1]:  as for the woman next to hawking，
[Speaker 1]:  there is currently no clear information。
[Speaker 1]:  she is most likely hawking's personal caregiver。
[Speaker 1]:  the in city's nature of this photo lies in the fact that it somehow exploits peoplestereotypes，
[Speaker 1]:  making them think that a slightly attractive woman is likely to be one of absteinen's sexual companions。
[Speaker 1]:  little，
[Speaker 1]:  did they know that there also beautiful women among top physicists？
[Speaker 1]:  some might wonder why estein didn't hold the workshop on his own island，
[Speaker 1]:  which would be more convenient instead of going to someone else's 's territory。
[Speaker 1]:  after seeing this picture，
[Speaker 1]:  you'll understand this thirty two square kilometer island is same thomas island，
[Speaker 1]:  with the conference was held little sain james island。
[Speaker 1]:  on the other hand，
[Speaker 1]:  is the small dot next to it。
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  you read that wrde the world famous little sae。
[Speaker 1]:  james island is only zero point two，
[Speaker 1]:  eight square kilometers in area。
[Speaker 1]:  and all the buildings on the island combined only have a total building area of two to three thousand square meters。
[Speaker 1]:  this might seem large to some chinese people，
[Speaker 1]:  but it's far from enough to host a large scale event in short，
[Speaker 1]:  a small resort with only two or three thousand square meters。
[Speaker 1]:  and the main buildings only over seven hundred square meters to have so many people on the island at once。
[Speaker 1]:  how many exactly this semon are invited more than twenty top physicists from around the world，
[Speaker 1]:  and even including a company in personnel，
[Speaker 1]:  there must be at least four or five people considering that it has been exposed before the style will。
[Speaker 1]:  lequire island is usually one on many。
[Speaker 1]:  that is one man with multiple girls，
[Speaker 1]:  so that would require hundreds of people friends who have lived in large houses in north america，
[Speaker 1]:  can evaluate this。
[Speaker 1]:  if your houses already seven hundred or eight hundred square meters can accommodate more than one hundred people。
[Speaker 1]:  people for orgie。
[Speaker 1]:  are they all going to be crammed ed into the ackyard ard wn，
[Speaker 1]:  unless you're like upstein，
[Speaker 1]:  bringing seven or eight people to the island at a time in shifts。
[Speaker 1]:  more importantly，
[Speaker 1]:  professor lawrence，
[Speaker 1]:  the organizer and participant of the event，
[Speaker 1]:  generously shared this photo on his blog without any intention of covering it out。
[Speaker 1]:  it's hard to imagine how he would introduce this event to these dozens of world announce scientists，
[Speaker 1]:  gentlemen，
[Speaker 1]:  and ladies next week were going to a small island in the coribbian to discuss the issue of gravitational waves。
[Speaker 1]:  after the meeting，
[Speaker 1]:  we've organizthe grouroup ge duduto，
[Speaker 1]:  the the liititspace to hold the spirit of llafunababiby by venture rules and entering batchers according to the alphabetical order of your names as arranged by the organizers，
[Speaker 1]:  elderly and disable led have priority。
[Speaker 1]:  the first bat will be the next batch trying to get everyone involved is that right？
[Speaker 1]:  cool。
[Speaker 1]:  finally，
[Speaker 1]:  so far，
[Speaker 1]:  none of the affour mention victim girls have come forward to accuse hawking of participying in any improper activities。
[Speaker 1]:  hawking's name is not in esteine's little black book，
[Speaker 1]:  which is the contact list。
[Speaker 1]:  so how much hawking participated and whether he was framed，
[Speaker 1]:  you can judge for yourself，
[Speaker 1]:  just a quick mention here among the rumours about hawking。
[Speaker 1]:  there is a widely circulated picture like this。
[Speaker 1]:  what does that mean？
[Speaker 1]:  are you saying that hawking also frequently went to the island for pleasure？
[Speaker 1]:  yes，
[Speaker 1]:  jeffrey，
[Speaker 1]:  that is abstein like to invite intellectuals to the island to reward them for their outstanding work for humanity and other darker reasons。
[Speaker 1]:  did jeffrey ever talk to you about hawking's preferences？
[Speaker 1]:  yes。
[Speaker 1]:  he like to watch naked pigs solving complex equations on a huge blackboard。
[Speaker 1]:  this content is inherently obsured in clearly theterical，
[Speaker 1]:  not especious or formal speech，
[Speaker 1]:  not especially the last sentence，
[Speaker 1]:  which is obvionsly，
[Speaker 1]:  mocking abstince，
[Speaker 1]:  physical disability and inability to stand。
[Speaker 1]:  in fact，
[Speaker 1]:  you won't find this image in any officially published document from a formatting standpoint。
[Speaker 1]:  it's neither an email record nor a formal statement and it lacthe speaker's name，
[Speaker 1]:  time and location。
[Speaker 1]:  it started as a citrical image uploaded to twitter and later spread on read as a shocking point of discussion，
[Speaker 1]:  eventually circulating in simplified chinese and becoming a tool to promote conspiracy theories about the weakness of the united states，
[Speaker 1]:  speaking of conspiracy y ories？
[Speaker 1]:  or does this point out one of the most common conspiracy theory thought processes in the entire abstein case，
[Speaker 1]:  the association of appearance with criminal activity as a basis for inference。
[Speaker 1]:  what does this mean？
[Speaker 1]:  many people's logic is that if you had any interaction with abstein participated in activities together，
[Speaker 1]:  had photos or email exexchanges wewere on his contact list with automatically of quits to sexual assault and complicity。
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  michael jackson，
[Speaker 1]:  when we will discuss next，
[Speaker 1]:  didn't appear in the flight。
[Speaker 1]:  loggs had no record of being on the island or any photos and wasn't accused by any victim yet simply because he visited abstenes villa in pomb beach for a while he was labeled to participating in an orgy。
[Speaker 1]:  let me briefly explained the rocess。
[Speaker 1]:  remember virginia roberts，
[Speaker 1]:  who accused prince andrew during the twenty fifteen teen al al lalayer asked，
[Speaker 1]:  did did see see any celebrities at abstines repreplied。
[Speaker 1]:  i saw michael jackson，
[Speaker 1]:  the lawyer then asked，
[Speaker 1]:  did he receive andprocess our service from abstein。
[Speaker 1]:  she replied，
[Speaker 1]:  no。
[Speaker 1]:  did you see him have any sexual contact with any underage ggirls？
[Speaker 1]:  she replied，
[Speaker 1]:  no。
[Speaker 1]:  roberfururexplaplathat based on her observations，
[Speaker 1]:  jjackson was only gueguest there and refused the massage service service offered by upstein。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  MJ 's names still frequently ofpears in discussions about little sain james island。
[Speaker 1]:  this brings this back to a very common psychological phenomenon，
[Speaker 1]:  which also explains the illusion of depth perception。
[Speaker 1]:  people have heard too many names keywords like epin，
[Speaker 1]:  isisland and pedophilia。
[Speaker 1]:  because there are too many details，
[Speaker 1]:  it easily leads to information overload。
[Speaker 1]:  so the brain automatically puts all the names that have appeared into the same templant to save the trouble of cross referencing and verification。
[Speaker 1]:  there are many similar examples。
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  why do chinese people when mentioning western countries immediately think of them as evil colonizers，
[Speaker 1]:  who bullichina ina enced us to sign humiliating treaties because the CCP has been criticizing the US for decades，
[Speaker 1]:  instilling in people，
[Speaker 1]:  narratives of victim hoods，
[Speaker 1]:  such as the eight naation alliance invading china。
[Speaker 1]:  but if you actually check the vast majority of european countries，
[Speaker 1]:  plus australia had no conflict with china，
[Speaker 1]:  yet you still automatically categorized into into same templant。
[Speaker 1]:  in fact，
[Speaker 1]:  let alone one jackson who never went to the island，
[Speaker 1]:  even those who did go to the island cannot prove that they receive sexual services or even participated in the sexual assaulof minors。
[Speaker 1]:  the reason is simple for top figures like abstein。
[Speaker 1]:  what he needed most was to collect celebrities as social fisets to endors him。
[Speaker 1]:  this is similar to attending parties and getting various phohotos with celebrities。
[Speaker 1]:  but can you say that these people necessarily have deep relationships or friendships？
[Speaker 1]:  no，
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  i met jacky chachanted and event in and even took a photo with him。
[Speaker 1]:  if the party state now arrest a dissident like gool，
[Speaker 1]:  wangi and on investigation finds that jjacky chain had a photo with this dissident。
[Speaker 1]:  does that mean that jackie chain is also in anti party and anti government figure？
[Speaker 1]:  following this logic，
[Speaker 1]:  professor david growth，
[Speaker 1]:  who had a photo with stephen hawks，
[Speaker 1]:  also accepted in interview with CCTV and took a photo with the host。
[Speaker 1]:  does that mean CCTV ororanizing sexual services next to the two names that everyone is most concerned about？
[Speaker 1]:  did trump in must participate their names frequently appear in the recently exposed documents？
[Speaker 1]:  don't day。
[Speaker 1]:  let's talk about trump。
[Speaker 1]:  first，
[Speaker 1]:  his name appeared quite a few times in those three million pages。
[Speaker 1]:  he's in the little black book。
[Speaker 1]:  the flight logs occasionally mentioned in emails，
[Speaker 1]:  and they're even photos of him with abstein。
[Speaker 1]:  so what exactly is his situation？
[Speaker 1]:  let's break it down。
[Speaker 1]:  first，
[Speaker 1]:  the little black book trumpin abstein were indeed old acquaintances。
[Speaker 1]:  they were neighbors in the nineties living in those luxurious mentioned mentioned earlier，
[Speaker 1]:  not far from each other since they both mingled in new yorks，
[Speaker 1]:  high society and were both social butterflies。
[Speaker 1]:  it's normal that they had each ther's contact information。
[Speaker 1]:  next，
[Speaker 1]:  the flight logs acaccording public recorords trumply on empsteen's private jtotototal of times concontrated between nineteen nineteen ty，
[Speaker 1]:  ty，
[Speaker 1]:  three and nineteen ninety seven。
[Speaker 1]:  the roots were all from new york to estins resort in atlantic city。
[Speaker 1]:  none of of the lights ts ent ent to near little same jjames island。
[Speaker 1]:  basicit was just two billionairres living in the same area who who happened to share a private jet regarding the photos，
[Speaker 1]:  the stststing photos of the two togetowere，
[Speaker 1]:  mostly public photos taken at trumps mara illogo resort in two thousand。
[Speaker 1]:  the photos also include millonnia，
[Speaker 1]:  who was trummps girlfriend at the time。
[Speaker 1]:  interestingly，
[Speaker 1]:  by two thousand four，
[Speaker 1]:  these two guys had a complete falling out。
[Speaker 1]:  the first reason was a dispute over resort property。
[Speaker 1]:  there was a mention in pomb beach being auctioned off abstein wwanted to buy it，
[Speaker 1]:  but trump out bid him。
[Speaker 1]:  the second reason was that trump discovered abstein was trying to poach female staff from his mario logo resort。
[Speaker 1]:  after that，
[Speaker 1]:  trump kicked him out of the mario logo club。
[Speaker 1]:  logically，
[Speaker 1]:  if trump had really participated in epsteine sex trafficking，
[Speaker 1]:  and there were compromising video tape of him，
[Speaker 1]:  would he dare to break ties with abstein over these things？
[Speaker 1]:  it doesn't seem to make sense，
[Speaker 1]:  right？
[Speaker 1]:  finally，
[Speaker 1]:  regarding political statements so far，
[Speaker 1]:  none of the victims mentioned earlier have come forward to accused or mentioned trump。
[Speaker 1]:  the only instance that stands out is from twenty sixteen。
[Speaker 1]:  when an anonymous woman came forward，
[Speaker 1]:  claiming the donald trump had sexrey assaulted her a jeffrey empenens mentioned in manhatden in nineteen ninety four，
[Speaker 1]:  and that she was only thirteen years old at the time。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  the credibility of this testimony is highly questionable。
[Speaker 1]:  first，
[Speaker 1]:  the woman never showed her face，
[Speaker 1]:  and during three hearings，
[Speaker 1]:  she used different teliasses，
[Speaker 1]:  fake addresses and fake phone numbers and even changed her appearance through out the process。
[Speaker 1]:  this means that we still cannot find any real information about her in the media。
[Speaker 1]:  her name appearance her age remain unknown。
[Speaker 1]:  second，
[Speaker 1]:  her testimony contains contradictions。
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  when asked by the police why she didn't report the incident at the time and waited more than twenty years to file a complaint，
[Speaker 1]:  she claimed that she didn't recognize trump at the time and only recognize him after watching his reality，
[Speaker 1]:  show the apprentice。
[Speaker 1]:  but the problem is that trump was already well known wn celebrity in the united states in nineteen ninety four，
[Speaker 1]:  a real estate mogl and author to say that she didn't recognize him at all is quite far fetched，
[Speaker 1]:  even if she didn't recognize him initially and only recognize him after watching television。
[Speaker 1]:  the apprentice aired in two thousand and four。
[Speaker 1]:  so why weight twelve years to report it？
[Speaker 1]:  third，
[Speaker 1]:  the timing of her lowsuit is suspicion。
[Speaker 1]:  it coincided with the eve of trumppfirst presidential campaign n。
[Speaker 1]:  she dropped the lawsuit midway without any reason。
[Speaker 1]:  furthermore，
[Speaker 1]:  the driving force behind this lawsuit，
[Speaker 1]:  the person who helped the woman draft the complaint and contact the media is a man named normake lostbo producer er of famfamous american bbrow talk show。
[Speaker 1]:  the show is known for recruiting fake guests and manufacturing dramatic conflicts，
[Speaker 1]:  and is often considered a prime example of trashy television。
[Speaker 1]:  loboo has a history of fabricating celebrity scandals using guests to lie maup stories and rightscripts to generate traffic。
[Speaker 1]:  basically，
[Speaker 1]:  this is an american version of sensationalism，
[Speaker 1]:  and the possibility of being being a stun to capitalize on the election is very high。
[Speaker 1]:  based on the above information，
[Speaker 1]:  we can say that from the evidence currently available，
[Speaker 1]:  the likelihood of trumps involvement is not high。
[Speaker 1]:  finally，
[Speaker 1]:  after the reccently classification of documents related to upstein，
[Speaker 1]:  several media outlets，
[Speaker 1]:  including bybard，
[Speaker 1]:  have focused their reporting on airline，
[Speaker 1]:  must association with abstein。
[Speaker 1]:  it should be said that based on the information currently available，
[Speaker 1]:  musk may have had mlitious intentions between twenty twelve and twenty thirteen。
[Speaker 1]:  musking epstein exchange emails twice discussing a potential meeting below is a direct translation of the original text。
[Speaker 1]:  the first exchange was on september twenty fifty fifty。
[Speaker 1]:  twtwelve epstein first invited musk saying，
[Speaker 1]:  if you have time to come to my corvian island，
[Speaker 1]:  you're welcome to bring someone。
[Speaker 1]:  i'll be there for most of november in december。
[Speaker 1]:  quote must replied that day sounds good。
[Speaker 1]:  i'll go if i have time in october of the same year，
[Speaker 1]:  epsteine followed up，
[Speaker 1]:  saying we can meet new york，
[Speaker 1]:  or i can send a private jet to pick you up。
[Speaker 1]:  it's only forty five minutes away。
[Speaker 1]:  then in late november，
[Speaker 1]:  estein asked how many people will be coming with you on the helicopter to the island？
[Speaker 1]:  muscreplied probably just me until luna note，
[Speaker 1]:  telulula was musks wife at the time，
[Speaker 1]:  then came the crucial sentence。
[Speaker 1]:  musk asked，
[Speaker 1]:  which day are night on your island，
[Speaker 1]:  has the wildest party，
[Speaker 1]:  then on christmas day must asked，
[Speaker 1]:  have you arranged any parties？
[Speaker 1]:  i've been working like crazy this year。
[Speaker 1]:  so after the kids go home for christmas，
[Speaker 1]:  i really want to relax on same barfelomy or some other island。
[Speaker 1]:  thank you very much for the invitation，
[Speaker 1]:  but we don't want a too quiet island。
[Speaker 1]: 嗯，
[Speaker 1]:  quote note，
[Speaker 1]:  he said this island wasn't little same james island，
[Speaker 1]:  but another resort island over two hundred kilomometers away，
[Speaker 1]:  not belonging to epstein。
[Speaker 1]:  epsteine replied，
[Speaker 1]:  understood omomet you on same birth thelley。
[Speaker 1]:  the male female ratio on my island might make a lelua uncomfortable mete，
[Speaker 1]:  a brief explanation here。
[Speaker 1]:  what is uncomfortable？
[Speaker 1]:  male female ratio mean，
[Speaker 1]:  according to previously exposed information，
[Speaker 1]:  the male female ratio and little saint james island was usually extremely skilled，
[Speaker 1]:  often with a dozen or more female escort，
[Speaker 1]:  serving one male client。
[Speaker 1]:  so he was hinting that the ratio might be uncomfortable。
[Speaker 1]:  this was actually a test，
[Speaker 1]:  meaning you're bringing your wife。
[Speaker 1]:  are you sure your wife can accept this situation，
[Speaker 1]:  don't let her get scared。
[Speaker 1]:  and call the police quote then came the most chilling part must reply was the ratio is not a problem for teluua。
[Speaker 1]:  you can imagine the message conveyed behind this。
[Speaker 1]:  however，
[Speaker 1]:  on january，
[Speaker 1]:  third，
[Speaker 1]:  musk suddenly send an email cancelling the trip，
[Speaker 1]:  citing transportation problems。
[Speaker 1]:  this was the first time his planned visit to the island fell through，
[Speaker 1]:  then almost a year later must send another email triking during the christmas and new year holidays。
[Speaker 1]:  would you have a suitable time for me to visit in that area？
[Speaker 1]:  epsteine replied，
[Speaker 1]:  any day from the first to the eighth？
[Speaker 1]:  is fine。
[Speaker 1]:  you can come over any time you want to have fun。
[Speaker 1]:  quote。
[Speaker 1]:  two days later，
[Speaker 1]:  estein cancelled the trip，
[Speaker 1]:  saying bad news。
[Speaker 1]:  unfortunately，
[Speaker 1]:  my schedule requires me to stay in the i was really looking forward to finally being able to hang out together。
[Speaker 1]:  just for fun。
[Speaker 1]:  i'm disappointed and hope we can reschedule soon quote，
[Speaker 1]:  and that was the end of it。
[Speaker 1]:  from the above emails。
[Speaker 1]:  we can easily deduce that these two rounds of emails were the closest muask came to visiting the island，
[Speaker 1]:  but he probably hadn't been there before。
[Speaker 1]:  otherwise，
[Speaker 1]:  epstein wouldn't have said something like looking forward to finally being able to hang out together。
[Speaker 1]:  secondly，
[Speaker 1]:  muse was likely aware of the orges on the island，
[Speaker 1]:  because by twenty twelve，
[Speaker 1]:  the abstein case was already globally known，
[Speaker 1]:  but he still seemed eager to go。
[Speaker 1]:  so musque situation is likely that he have the intention，
[Speaker 1]:  but didn't have the opportunity，
[Speaker 1]:  yet the above summarises，
[Speaker 1]:  the situations of some of the most controversial and famous people involved so far，
[Speaker 1]:  isn't it less shocking than you might have imagined？
[Speaker 1]:  next，
[Speaker 1]:  let's discuss whether a illeda island incident has sparked such a high level of discussion besides involving a large number of celebrities。
[Speaker 1]:  the most important reason is the star contrast presented by the entire incident。
[Speaker 1]:  on one hand，
[Speaker 1]:  there is extremely strong pressure from both houses of congress demanding disclosure when the upsteine transparency act was voted on the house of representatives，
[Speaker 1]:  pasted four hundred twenty seven，
[Speaker 1]:  seven to one，
[Speaker 1]:  the the senate pasted unananimously icicrepresenting，
[Speaker 1]:  the general public opinion。
[Speaker 1]:  on the other hand，
[Speaker 1]:  after years of investigation，
[Speaker 1]:  besides upstein in his girlfriend partner，
[Speaker 1]:  maxwell，
[Speaker 1]:  only prince andrew was held accountable，
[Speaker 1]:  and even then only partially almost none of the other celebrity clients were exposed，
[Speaker 1]:  and almost no one was convicted，
[Speaker 1]:  lost their job or suffered any form of punishment。
[Speaker 1]:  this is what the public finds most unacceptable。
[Speaker 1]:  so it's crebecause such a huge mess。
[Speaker 1]:  but in the end，
[Speaker 1]:  you only served one client andrew，
[Speaker 1]:  who would believe that isn't it obvious that this is too too popoerful figures are involved。
[Speaker 1]:  they're afraid that the follow will be too great if it's exposed。
[Speaker 1]:  so it's no wonder that the investigation installed a edison on twitter，
[Speaker 1]:  said the US claims to be a beacon of democracy with an independent judiciary in the prince of that，
[Speaker 1]:  even the president is not above the law，
[Speaker 1]:  but in the end，
[Speaker 1]:  isn't it just a case of the pot calling in the attle black，
[Speaker 1]:  not much different from china quooif。
[Speaker 1]:  so then stop ridiculing china in the future。
[Speaker 1]:  what is the problem really？
[Speaker 1]:  that's simple。
[Speaker 1]:  first，
[Speaker 1]:  i don't rule up the possibility you mentioned that is，
[Speaker 1]:  for example，
[Speaker 1]:  the client list includes some high profile US allies predents，
[Speaker 1]:  kings etdera and exposure would seriously damage US alliances。
[Speaker 1]:  but there's another situation that can't be ignored the predicament of the legal system。
[Speaker 1]:  we mentioned the upstein case earlier，
[Speaker 1]:  especially sexual assault cases that occurred on a remote and isolated island like that one。
[Speaker 1]:  they are extremely difficult to prosecute。
[Speaker 1]:  let's take prince。
[Speaker 1]:  andrew was an example，
[Speaker 1]:  if the court doesn't accept the evidence and insist on sending him to prison and prince andrew adammately denies it and lets his lawyers fight to the death。
[Speaker 1]:  what will be the result？
[Speaker 1]:  most likely，
[Speaker 1]:  the prosecution will be told that the evidence is insufficient。
[Speaker 1]:  the victim waited so many years to file a complaint。
[Speaker 1]:  is there any reliable physical evidence？
[Speaker 1]:  no，
[Speaker 1]:  all the evidence is circumstantial。
[Speaker 1]:  you only have testimony and most are recorord of being being on the island，
[Speaker 1]:  even if there are photos of the two of them line naked together，
[Speaker 1]:  who can prove that they actually had sexual relation and that she was under eighteen at the time。
[Speaker 1]:  if andrew acts shamelessly and says he wasn't in his right mind at the time or that he stop when he found out she was under eighteen。
[Speaker 1]:  can you prove he's ining？
[Speaker 1]:  so you see if we follow the principle of innocent until proven guilty and the standards of modern law，
[Speaker 1]:  none of these clients can be convicted in this situation，
[Speaker 1]:  even if the department of justice obtains island records are some new photos there。
[Speaker 1]:  they make them public or rather can they make them public once they are made public，
[Speaker 1]:  and they can't convict anyone。
[Speaker 1]:  the people involved will sue them for definmation and demand huge senation。
[Speaker 1]:  remember，
[Speaker 1]:  these people's lawyers are not to be trifled with。
[Speaker 1]:  you're not the chinese government you'd be sued to dead。
[Speaker 1]:  but on the other hand，
[Speaker 1]:  the public outcry and public opinion are there you？
[Speaker 1]:  you can't do nothing。
[Speaker 1]:  the final result can only be this convoluted mess。
[Speaker 1]:  the newspaper published a water down version，
[Speaker 1]:  revealing a lot of key information that was completely obscured in the document，
[Speaker 1]:  even without any so called political obstruction from higher levels。
[Speaker 1]:  he could only do this。
[Speaker 1]:  this isn't some kind of american political hypocriracy or spiriracy。
[Speaker 1]:  it simply，
[Speaker 1]:  the procedural justice that the modern judicial system has to bear the notion that all clows are black in this case is largely a misunderstanding brought about by a cultural misinterpretation。
[Speaker 1]:  at the end of this program。
[Speaker 1]:  i want to say something to the many people who have been critizing the US because of the abstain case，
[Speaker 1]:  even concluding that america is dead。
[Speaker 1]:  ad。
[Speaker 1]:  constistitutionalism is just a lie。
[Speaker 1]:  if you're here with a propaganded agenda，
[Speaker 1]:  then i have nothing to say。
[Speaker 1]:  but if you nothing think way，
[Speaker 1]:  then you may have misunderstood the american system from the beginning，
[Speaker 1]:  in many a people's eyes，
[Speaker 1]:  freedom and conmocracy or constitutionalism seem like a penancia，
[Speaker 1]:  a major pill that once swallowed instantly transforms everyone into morely upright individuals，
[Speaker 1]:  as you got to，
[Speaker 1]:  has opened his eyes and achieved substantive justice。
[Speaker 1]:  in every case，
[Speaker 1]:  punishing every bad person in exoerating，
[Speaker 1]:  every good person，
[Speaker 1]:  but is this possible？
[Speaker 1]:  no，
[Speaker 1]:  first of all，
[Speaker 1]:  no system whether religious faith based or legal can fundamentally eliminate evil，
[Speaker 1]:  raise the average moral level of a group。
[Speaker 1]:  if you expect this，
[Speaker 1]:  you are essentially hoping to transform human nature，
[Speaker 1]:  which is the same thing mousidong。
[Speaker 1]:  and the cultural revolution tried to do。
[Speaker 1]:  when i express this view on twitter a few days ago，
[Speaker 1]:  a lot of people refuted me saying that christiantities great。
[Speaker 1]:  and relious ous people are generally kind，
[Speaker 1]:  and there are moral level is much higher。
[Speaker 1]:  if that were true that i ask you，
[Speaker 1]:  is it a facue that there are so many scandals involving priests and catholic church is around the world that it has become a mean with the cruisades initiated by christians was the burning of bruno at the stake during the middle ages done by christians。
[Speaker 1]:  i'm not trying to be disrespectful to catholis or christians here。
[Speaker 1]:  my point is，
[Speaker 1]:  if simply believing in a religion can created uuopan world where everyone is good，
[Speaker 1]:  then then bother with religious reforforulultimately。
[Speaker 1]:  aren't the good thing that christian cicicialization has brought about achieved the legal and institutional reforms that limit，
[Speaker 1]:  rather than eliminate the evil in people's hearts。
[Speaker 1]:  the reality is when discussing human nature itself，
[Speaker 1]:  there's no inhesusuperiordior theoordy between americans and chinese black people and white people，
[Speaker 1]:  men and women，
[Speaker 1]:  homosexuals and hederosexuals christians，
[Speaker 1]:  and atheiists communist and liberals，
[Speaker 1]:  or even those who support the government and those who oppose it。
[Speaker 1]:  the only difference is that a good system can maximately restrained the evil within human nature，
[Speaker 1]:  while a bad system，
[Speaker 1]:  such as one that encourage his sons to report their fathers，
[Speaker 1]:  can amplify this evil and cause immense destruction。
[Speaker 1]:  therefore，
[Speaker 1]:  theis no need to lament the decline of the united states。
[Speaker 1]:  just because some powerful and famous people have committed wrondoing，
[Speaker 1]:  because those on the powlist and the ford's lists deep down their humanity and moral standards，
[Speaker 1]:  extreme situations are no better than those of ddjamin。
[Speaker 1]:  and his fellow villagers，
[Speaker 1]:  this applies to everyone，
[Speaker 1]:  including you and me watching this screen。
[Speaker 1]:  it's like how we all criticize officials for corruption。
[Speaker 1]:  but if you were in that position，
[Speaker 1]:  you would most likely do the same。
[Speaker 1]:  the only difference is whether we allow ourselves to be in an environment that insites the evil in human nature。
[Speaker 1]:  okay，
[Speaker 1]:  that's offer today's program。
[Speaker 1]:  if you have any questions，
[Speaker 1]:  please leave a comment or send me an email see you next time。
