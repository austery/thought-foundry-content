I can't think of a single circumstance where I would not tell a leader to at least be watching for the disruptive forces at work in the market and experimenting with some of the disruptions that are taking place in and around their market. There are a set of repeatable skills, repeatable behaviors that anybody can follow. that anybody can get better at with conscious practice that can increase their odds of spotting, shaping, responding to disruptive change. It is a very learnable skill and there's no leader today that has an excuse of, "Oh, I just don't have it in me to do this." You do. It's a choice to develop those skills or not.
