Perhaps a few years ago, people would say, "Oh, I can just wrap a model and build a successful company." And that, I think, has probably gotten debunked just because of the model capabilities. So let's take even this little thing we built called Excel Agent. Excel Agent is not a UI-level wrapper. It's actually a model. that is in the middle tier. In this case, because we have all the IP from the GPT family, we are taking that and putting it into the core middle tier of the office system to teach it what it means to natively understand Excel. So I'm giving it even essentially a markdown to teach it the skills of what it means to be a sophisticated Excel user. So in some sense, Excel will come with an analyst bundled in. That's the type of stuff that will get built by everybody. So even for the model companies, they're allowed to compete, right? So if their price stuff high, guess what? If I'm a builder of a tool like this, I'll substitute you. I may use you for a while. And so as long as there's competition where there's multiple models and there's an open source check, there is enough room here to go build value on top of models. At Microsoft, the way I look at it and say is we will build our own application scaffolding, which will be model forward, right? It won't be a wrapper on a model, but the model will be wrapped into the application.
