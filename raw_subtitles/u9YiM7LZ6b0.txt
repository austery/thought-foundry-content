- Quantum mechanics is weird
because despite the fact
that we're celebrating its
100th anniversary right now,
we still don't understand it.
What is really going on in this our best,
most important framework for
doing fundamental physics?
We understand on the basis
of quantum gravity why the
earth moves around the sun
or apples fall from trees,
but we don't understand what happens
when gravity becomes
strong like in a black hole
or near the big bang.
So basically, nature uses every
trick that it can think of
to make physics work in interesting ways,
and it really does give physicists a sense
of accomplishment at the end
of the day to figure it all out.
I'm Sean Carroll.
I'm a Physicist and Philosopher
at Johns Hopkins University,
Host of the Mindscape Podcast
and also author of a bunch of books,
most recently "The Biggest
Ideas in the Universe" series,
including "Space, Time and
Motion" and "Quanta and Fields".
- [Narrator] How does
quantum mechanics work?
- I'd like to think if
you were a physicist,
circa 1895, okay?
The very end of the 19th century,
you would've been forgiven for thinking
that we were almost there.
We were almost having a complete theory
of nature in our grasp,
because they had the
idea of particles, right?
You know, the idea of an
atom was a little bit sketchy
to a lot of physicists in the 1800s,
but they eventually caught on
and they were beginning to
realize that atoms were made
of other particles, protons, neutrons,
electrons and so forth.
And then the particles,
which make up matter,
are pushed around by fields,
by the electric field,
by the magnetic field,
by the gravitational field and so forth.
So you have this sort of two-part harmony.
Matter is made of particles,
forces come from fields,
and the all of the effort in the future
of physics would be figuring
out what are all the particles,
what are all the fields?
And then you'd be done.
There were a couple of
clouds on the horizon.
One of them ended up being relativity.
The fact that the symmetries
of Maxwell's theory of
electromagnetism were different
than the symmetries
of Newton's theory of classical mechanics.
But the others were that
there were certain properties
of matter and materials
that didn't quite seem to make sense.
And I'm gonna be a historical now.
Let's pop forward to like 1911.
They were putting together
the picture of the atom
that is the cartoon
you've always seen, right?
There's a little nucleus
at the center of the atom,
and electrons are circling around it
like planets orbiting a star.
This is called the Rutherford Atom Model
after Ernest Rutherford, who
was a brilliant experimental
and theoretical physicist.
And this was entertained
and people liked the idea
that electrons were kind
of like little planets, but
they instantly figured out
it can't possibly be right,
because that electron orbiting the nucleus
would give off electromagnetic waves.
It's a moving particle.
Moving charged particles give off light.
All of the light you're
looking at right now came
from some electron in
motion moving around.
So you can calculate.
You can say if the electron
is moving around in orbit
around the atomic nucleus,
if it gives off light, it will lose energy
and spiral into the nucleus.
How long should that take?
And the answer is, every
atom in the universe,
including the ones in the
chair you're sitting on,
or even in your own body, should collapse
to a point in a hundredth
of a billionth of a second.
So that clearly does not happen.
The idea that electrons
are like little planets
in a solar system is just wrong.
And this and other things,
black body radiation
and other experimental
results convinced people
that there wasn't this clean division
between particles and forces.
They said there's aspects
of light, which is supposed
to be a wave, which are particle-like,
Einstein said that.
There are aspects of
particles like electrons
that are wave-like.
Louis de Broglie following
work by Niels Bohr
and others said that.
And this whole thing coalesces
almost exactly 100 years ago in 1925
in the theory of quantum mechanics.
And almost right at the same time,
two different versions of it came out.
Werner Heisenberg had his
version called matrix mechanics.
Erwin Schrödinger had his
version called wave mechanics.
They show that they were actually
mathematically equivalent,
but quantum mechanics, I
like to say it was the second
of two big ideas in
the history of physics.
The first big idea in physics
was classical mechanics.
Relativity is a pretty big idea,
but not as big as classical mechanics
or the second big idea,
which is quantum mechanics.
Quantum mechanics throws
away classical mechanics
and replaces it with
something very different.
It says that electrons are
not particles or waves.
They act like waves until you look at them
and then they look like particles.
That is a very, very
difficult thing to swallow,
and physicists are still trying
to figure out what to make of it.
It's so much fun reading the history
of how these ideas developed,
'cause today we're just
taught the final result,
but you know, they didn't know
what was going on back in the early days.
In 1926, Erwin Schrödinger
presents an equation,
what we now call the wave function.
It's a dopey name for
a very important idea.
So think of that little electron
instead of orbiting in
a circle, it's a wave.
It has a profile around
the center of the atom.
And the equation works very well.
It's still the equation that we use today,
but then you have to ask, okay,
semi-philosophical question,
what is the wave function?
What is it telling us?
And Schrödinger thought, well, okay,
in some cases, electrons act like waves.
In other cases they act like particles.
Maybe the equation says that if you start
with an electron wave all
spread out, it will sort
of localize itself near some point
and it will look like a particle.
Turns out not to be true.
The equations don't care
about your feelings.
It's the opposite.
If you start out with a
localized electron wave,
it will spread out all over the place.
So it was yet another physicist, Max Born,
different than Niels Bohr,
who pointed out the right way
to think about
Schrödinger's wave function.
He said, think about what happens
when you measure a
property of the electron,
like its position or its velocity
or whatever you wanna measure.
He says, "What the wave function
is doing is it's telling me
the probability of getting a
different measurement outcome."
In particular, if you want the math,
you square the wave function,
that tells you the probability
of seeing the electron somewhere.
And this was just bizarre
and crazy for all sorts of reasons.
People didn't like the idea probabilities
were involved at all.
Of course there's probabilities
when you flip a coin,
but that's just 'cause you
just don't know everything
there is to know about the coin.
Since the time of Newton
and Laplace, we thought
that physics deep down was
perfectly deterministic.
And here's Max Born saying, no, it's not.
That was difficult to swallow.
But the other thing that's difficult
to swallow is why in the world is the idea
of measuring or observing something,
showing up in the
fundamental laws of physics?
That had never happened before.
Of course you have to think
about measuring things
and observing things,
but it was always imagined
that if I measure the position
of a planet or something
like that, in principle,
I can do that measurement
completely benignly
without disturbing the
system in any way at all.
And what Born is saying
is that when you measure
an electron, you instantly
and dramatically change its wave function.
And to tell me what the
fundamental laws of physics are,
according to what became known
as the Copenhagen interpretation
of quantum mechanics
after the city where Niels
Bohr and Werner Heisenberg
and others were doing their work, part
of those fundamental laws
are a set of rules that say,
here's what's happen,
what happens when you measure
the properties of a system.
So quantum mechanics is the
only theory in the history
of physics that has rules
about measurement outcomes
and has measurement
playing an important role
in what those laws are.
And if you ask, well,
what is a measurement?
What counts?
Do I have to be conscious?
Can a video camera do a measurement?
The answer is we're not gonna
tell you the answer to that.
We don't have an agreed
upon set of criteria
for when a measurement happens.
And this is known cleverly
as the measurement problem
of quantum mechanics.
There's various plausible
resolutions to it,
but we don't agree on
what the right one is.
Very often in physics, learning
physics, teaching physics,
doing physics, it's very helpful
to visualize things, either precisely
or maybe in some toy kind
of metaphorical way of doing things.
But we have to keep in
mind it's not necessary
that there be an accurate way
to visualize certain things.
We have to accept that
the world is not here
to make things easy for us.
So when it comes to the wave
function of quantum mechanics,
we're a little bit stuck.
There are simple cases.
Like if you have one electron
and that's it, no other particles,
you're talking about the wave
function of one electron,
you can actually visualize that.
If you just think about
space as two dimensional
to make your life easy, the
wave function is a function.
You're cheating a little bit
because rather than having
a value, it's a complex number that means
to say a real part plus
'i' times an imaginary part
where 'i' is squared to minus one.
But okay, who cares?
What you need to know is there's
a profile, there's a shape.
There's basically a value
at every point in space
which says, this is the wave function
of the electron at every point in space.
So go ahead and visualize it.
If you ever took chemistry class
and you saw those images
of what are called orbitals
in different kinds of atoms,
those are literally
pictures of wave functions.
Those are values of the wave
functions of different shapes,
the wave function of an
electron can take in an atom.
But just to show you that the universe
is not gonna always go that easy on you,
sometimes you have two
electrons that you care about.
And one of the most profound
features of quantum mechanics,
which separates it from
classical mechanics
is that you don't have a wave
function for electron one
and a separate wave
function for electron two,
because remember, the job of
the wave function is to say,
what is the probability
that I measure something?
Right?
So when I have two electrons,
I can have the probability
of seeing one electron
anywhere in the universe,
and I also have the
probability I see the other one
everywhere in the universe,
but they can be connected.
Maybe I know that the electrons
are one centimeter apart,
but I don't know where they are, right?
If I measure one of them,
then I instantly know
where the other one is.
But I don't know ahead of time
where either one of them are.
This is the phenomenon
called entanglement,
and what it means is
that rather than having
one separate wave
function for one particle
and a distinct one for the other one,
which would mean there's
no connection between them,
the wave function tells me the probability
of both particles at once.
Mathematically, if you want the details,
you assign a complex number
to every pair of positions,
the position of particle one
and the position of particle two.
You want to visualize that?
Good luck.
You're not really gonna be able to do it
unless you can visualize complex functions
in six-dimensional space.
But that's what it actually is.
We can write it down
and we can deal with it,
and we can go back to
what things look like
when it's just one electron
if we wanna really wanna visualize things,
but at some point we have to trust
that the equations know
what they're doing.
You would think from the
name quantum mechanics
that quantum mechanics has something to do
with quantum, which is a word made up
to denote a discreet amount of stuff.
It comes from the fact
that in the early days
of inventing quantum mechanics,
when you had radiation coming
from hot radiating bodies
or when you had electrons
in orbits around atoms,
there were discreet possible
energies you could observe.
Light is absorbed at
certain frequencies by gas
and not at other frequencies.
When an electron changes
energies inside an atom,
it goes from a certain energy
to another one without being
in between, without sort
of continuously evolving
from one energy to another.
So there was this idea of a
quantum jump from one state
to another, but that discreetness
is not fundamental to quantum mechanics.
It's not built in.
It's not because quantum
mechanics says the world
is discreet, it's made of pixels,
it's sit on a lattice
or anything like that.
It's because the opposite.
Quantum mechanics is a story
of waves, but sometimes waves only vibrate
with certain discreet sets of frequencies.
Think of a string attached
at two ends, like on a guitar
or a violin or whatever.
You can pluck the string,
and given the tension of the string
and the distance between
the ends, it will vibrate,
it will give you a certain note,
but the same string is also able
to vibrate at twice the frequency.
There's the fundamental frequency
where the string vibrates
as a whole up and down,
and there is the next
overtone where it sort
of vibrates half and
half on different sides.
And then a harmonic series, there's a way
that the string can vibrate, so it goes up
and then down and up again.
That's three times, and so on.
So a discreet set of possible
frequencies comes out
of the motion of a
continuous string vibrating.
And likewise, the continuous wave function
in certain circumstances can only vibrate
with certain discreet frequencies.
And so that's why electrons
have discreet energies in atoms.
Now, quantum mechanics is a framework,
just like classical mechanics is.
Classical mechanics doesn't
say what the world's made of.
It gives you the fundamental rules
and you pick out, oh, the
world is made of particles
or fluids or whatever,
and here are the forces acting on them.
And you plug that into the
framework of classical mechanics.
Quantum mechanics is the same way.
Most of what you talk about
when you first encounter
quantum mechanics, electrons and photons
or whatever, you're applying the rules
of quantum mechanics to particles.
But we've known since the
time of Maxwell at least
that there are also fields, right?
There's the electric
field, the magnetic field,
the gravitational field,
maybe there are others.
So we can also apply the rules
of quantum mechanics to fields.
And lo and behold, we get
what is called quantum field theory.
Quantum field theory
then is not a replacement
or an improvement on quantum mechanics.
It's just the rules of
quantum mechanics applied
to fields rather than particles.
And what happens is you take a field,
so a field is the opposite of a particle.
A particle has a location,
a field exists everywhere,
but it has a value at every point.
So the electric field is a little arrow
at every single point in space,
has a direction and a length.
And then you say, okay, that's a field.
I'm gonna apply the rules
of quantum mechanics to it.
So I'm gonna invent a wave
function for the field,
and I'm gonna say, what is the probability
the field looks a certain
way doing certain things?
And the math just goes
through exactly like an
electron sitting in an atom.
There are certain discreet
vibrational frequencies
of the field, and that shows up
in particle physics
experiments as particles.
The field vibrates a little bit,
you think you're looking at one particle.
If the field vibrates a little bit more,
now you think you're
looking at two particles,
and you can match up exactly
the mathematical descriptions
on both sides.
So the resolution to this early mystery
of quantum mechanics, why do electrons
or photons behave like
particles sometimes,
behave like waves other times?
The answer is number one, they're waves.
That's what they are.
They're waves in a field.
Not only is there an electric
field, a magnetic field,
there's an electron field
for the electron particle.
There's a neutrino field,
there's a quark field,
everything is made of fields.
But number two, when you apply the rules
of quantum mechanics to fields,
they show up in our
experiments like particles.
So this is why it
explains this distinction
that things act like waves
when we're not looking at them
and appear to us as particles when we do.
If we think back to that
late 19th century physicist
who thought matter was made
of particles, forces come from fields,
what happened to that guy?
Like where is he now in the world
where everything is actually fields
but they look like particles
when you apply the rules
of quantum mechanics to it?
Well, it turns out there are
two different kinds of fields,
fermions and bosons.
And the difference is, are you allowed
to stack up vibrations of the
fields on top of each other
to let them vibrate more and more?
That's what you're used to, right?
If I have a violin string,
I can pluck it a little bit.
I can pluck it a lot.
That is what we call a bosonic field.
Boson fields can compile
on top of each other.
But fermion fields have this
slightly interesting property
that there's only one kind
of vibration at a time
going on in the field.
In the particle language, we
say that in any one region
of space or in any one
quantum state, we can have
as many boson particles as we like,
but a fermion takes up space.
Fermions can only be one at a time.
If you go back to your
chemistry class again,
why can't you put all the
electrons in the lowest orbital?
There's a rule called the
Pauli exclusion principle
that says that for any one
shape of an atomic orbit,
only one electron can
be in there at a time.
Technically it's two electrons
'cause it can be spinning
clockwise or counterclockwise,
but that's the basic point.
Fermions take up space.
So the reason why our 1898
physicist thought the world
was made of particles and fields
is because really it's made of fields,
but those fields can
be bosons or fermions,
and fermion fields kind
of act particle-like.
They cannot pile on top of each other
to make a big classical
field like electricity
or magnetism or gravity.
The 20th century in physics,
it'll still be considered
an amazingly important time
in the history of physics.
We're still teaching physics
1,000 years from now,
the 20th century will be remembered.
Not only did we invent
relativity and quantum mechanics,
but we figured out what
particles in fields there are,
at least the ones that make up you and me.
You know, we started circa 1900.
We were trying to understand atoms.
We realized there's a nucleus,
and around the nucleus
there are electrons.
And then we realized that the
nucleus is not indivisible.
It's made up of protons and neutrons.
Skip forward to the 1960s and '70s,
and we realize that protons
and neutrons are not elementary
particles themselves.
Each proton and each neutron
contain three quarks.
And the way it works is a proton
has electric charge plus one,
a neutron has electric charge zero.
There are a kind of quark
called the up quark,
which has charge plus two thirds,
and the kind of quark
called the down quark,
which has charge minus one third.
So if you sit down there at home
and try to figure out
how can I make a proton?
How can I make a neutron?
You'll quickly figure out a proton
has two up quarks and one down quark,
a neutron has two down
quarks and one up quark.
And that's a pretty good
picture right there,
but it becomes complicated by the fact
that particles change
identities sometimes.
This was again, an exciting
thing in the early 20th century.
Radioactive decays, right?
If I have a neutron all by itself,
it can decay into a
proton and an electron.
It doesn't quite work
because certain things like
energy are not conserved.
We eventually figured
out there's another kind
of particle called the neutrino
that is created when a neutron decays.
Really a neutron decays
into proton, electron and anti-neutrino.
And how's that happening?
Well, neutron has two down quarks
and an up, proton has two ups and a down.
Inside the neutron,
one of those down quarks
converts into an up quark
by spitting out an electron
and an anti-neutrino.
So that's a pretty good picture.
We have four different
kinds of matter particles,
four different kinds of fermion,
up quarks and down quarks.
Those are both inside
protons and neutrons.
Then we have electrons and neutrinos.
Okay, you think that maybe
that's your complete picture.
Then we discovered now all
the way back in the 1930s,
a heavier cousin of the electron.
This is called the muon.
And famously, there was a
physicist at Columbia, I.I Rabi,
who said, "Who ordered that?"
We did not know why the electron needed
to have a heavier cousin in
involved, but now we know
it's because this idea of
the two quarks up and down
and the two non-quarks,
which we now call leptons,
the electron and the neutrino,
that pattern is repeated two more times.
So there are three families of particles.
There's the up quark and the down quark,
but then there's heavier
cousins, the charm quark
and the strange quark,
and even heavier cousins, the top quark
and the bottom quark.
And then on the lepton
side, we have the electron
and a neutrino associated
with the electron,
which we cleverly call
the electron neutrino.
We have the muon, its heavier
cousin and a muon neutrino.
And then we have a tau particle,
which is heavier than the muon
and a tau neutrino.
Six quarks, six leptons
arranged in three families.
And all of these particles,
these are all the fermions
that interact via bosonic fields.
We have of course the
electromagnetic field,
we have the gravitational field,
and then we have the nuclear forces.
Inside the proton and
neutron, there are gluons
which carry what we call
the strong nuclear force.
The gluons hold particles together,
hold quarks together in
the protons and neutrons.
And that conversion
of the neutron into a
proton, electron, neutrino,
that's the weak nuclear force.
It is carried by particles
called the W and Z bosons.
So that's more or less the picture.
That was the picture of all the particles
that we discovered up
until a few years ago.
We have six kinds of fermions,
we have four kinds of forces.
It turns out that to make
the whole thing fit together,
we need one more particle,
which is of course the Higgs boson.
The Higgs boson is not really
a force-carrying particle,
but it's not really a fermion either.
It's part of a field that
exists all throughout space,
and the other particles
are kind of swimming in it.
The other particles like
the quarks and the electrons
and so forth, feel the
influence of the Higgs field,
and it affects their
properties like their masses
and their charges.
So the Higgs field was
finally discovered in the form
of the Higgs boson in 2012,
and that as far as we
know is all the particles
that we're able to produce here on Earth.
This puts together
in what we call the standard
model of particle physics.
And if you do an experiment here on earth,
it is so far to date 100% compatible
with the standard model
of particle physics.
We look outside and we see
that we need dark matter
and things like that.
Dark matter doesn't seem to
fit into the standard model.
So we're optimistic that
there are more particles
we haven't yet discovered,
but right now we're doing
a good job of fitting
the data that we have.
If you think about the standard model,
it's on the one hand amazing.
Like everything fits together
like a really tightly
constructed jigsaw puzzle.
Everything matters.
Everything is doing
some purpose, et cetera.
But on the other hand,
it is kind of baroque
and almost ugly in some ways.
So many particles,
random-looking kinds of masses
and interactions for those particles.
We would like something
a little bit prettier.
In fact, most of the particles
in the standard model
don't play a role in your everyday life,
and that's simply
because there's a feature
that if you have a heavier
particle, a particle
with large mass, it will be able
to and want to decay
into lighter particles.
The only thing that stops
it is there are quantities
that are conserved like
electric charge and spin
and things like that that
you just can't get rid of.
The total number of quarks in the universe
is conserved, for example.
So the electron is the lightest particle
with an electric charge, charge minus one.
The proton is the lightest stable particle
that has a non-zero total
number of quarks inside.
The neutrino is the lightest
particle that has spin,
a half spin unit, as we say,
that makes it a fermion.
And turns out these are
basically the particles
that make up us.
There's also the neutron
gets thrown in there
because when you combine
a neutron and a proton,
you can make a stable nucleus.
But if you think about the
charm quark, the muon, the tau,
whatever, the top and bottom
quarks, the Higgs boson,
all these particles just decay away.
They were there near the big bang
in the very early universe,
but then they decayed
in the lighter particles.
Those lighter particles
assemble into atoms.
The atoms turnaround inside
stars and make heavier elements,
and ultimately they make us.
So you don't need a lot of the ingredients
of the standard model to explain you.
You are made out of up quarks, down quarks
and electrons held together
by the strong nuclear
force and electromagnetism.
That's 99.99% of understanding you.
You need to understand some
details about the masses
and the Higgs boson and things like that.
Gravity is important, but it
doesn't require that much.
And what's interesting is,
of course you can imagine,
and particle physicists love to imagine,
that there are new fields
and particles we haven't yet discovered.
Dark matter in the universe
is the best evidence
that we have directly,
there must be some particle
we haven't yet discovered
in order to account
for the gravity we see in
galaxies and the universe.
We don't know what the
dark matter particle is.
We know how much dark matter
there is and where it is.
We don't know what kind of particle it is,
but we know it doesn't interact
with you and your body.
How do we know that?
Because there are rules for what happens
when one particle interacts with another.
And if a certain particle could interact
with the things you're made
of, the electrons, the protons
and neutrons, then we would be able
to make it in the laboratory.
We would just smash
other particles together,
watch what comes out, and
the dark matter would appear.
Indeed, this is particle
physicists' favorite thing to do,
look for new particles by
smashing other ones together.
We haven't found anything by doing that
that is not already in the standard model
of particle physics.
So there almost certainly
are new unknown particles
and fields out there,
but there are either too energetic
to make in our best particle accelerators.
They're too massive.
It just takes too much
energy to create them.
Or they only interact
with ordinary matters
so feebly, so weakly that
maybe there's a chance
of making one, but we don't notice.
Either way, you are made
of electrons, protons
and neutrons interacting through
electromagnetism, gravity
and the nuclear forces.
One super fascinating thing
about the way the physical world
has arranged itself is
this phenomenon we like
to call emergence.
The idea that the air in this room.
I could describe by saying,
well, it has a certain density,
a certain temperature, you know,
a certain velocity perhaps.
But I know deep down that it's
made of atoms and molecules.
But I don't need to tell you the position
and velocity of every atom
and molecule in the
air to tell you useful,
interesting things about it.
We can have approximate,
but really, really good descriptions
of things based
on wildly incomplete
information about them.
I can predict the motion of the earth
around the sun without
knowing the exact position
and velocity of every atom in the earth.
So this is a good news, bad
news situation for physics.
We know the particles that
you and I are made of.
We know what is called the
core theory of physics.
The core theory is
basically Einstein's theory
of general relativity for
gravity, plus the standard model
of particle physics.
And that core theory
suffices to underlie all
of the physics of the everyday world.
That's the good news.
There's two pieces of bad news.
One piece of bad news is
it's hard to go beyond that.
We know that this theory
is not the final answer.
We're not saying that the core theory
is the theory of everything.
It doesn't explain the
big bang or black holes
or dark matter, et cetera.
Okay?
The other piece of bad
news is in principle,
it does account for chemistry, biology,
psychology, politics, who knows?
But in practice, that's
completely useless information.
If you want to be a biologist,
knowing about the top quark
is not important to your life.
Even knowing about up and down
quarks is not that important,
despite the fact
that there are protons
and neutrons in nuclei
and there are nuclei in atoms,
and there are atoms in
biological organisms.
If you wanna study biology, your best bet
is to study biology, not
to study particle physics.
So I think it's incredibly significant
how the different layers of
reality depend on each other.
And we know one layer really, really well,
the layers of particles
and forces at the level
of quantum field theory
and atoms and things like that.
We would like to do even
better at that layer,
but we understand it very, very well.
It leads to the layer
of chemistry and atoms.
The stability of the chair
that I'm sitting on ultimately
comes down to the rules
of quantum field theory.
Those atoms and molecules
come together with electricity
and magnetism to make all of chemistry,
which is a pretty big deal.
Chemistry comes together to make biology
and so up on the ladder.
We can both appreciate
that these different
levels depend on each other
while appreciating also that to study them
and to understand them, we need
to take each level seriously
for its own sake.
Physics is not just a set of true facts
and equations and things like that.
In many ways it's kind of an attitude.
It's a way of thinking
about different things.
So it can take you very far.
You can talk about the
physics of different kinds
of things all the way up
to the physics of society.
You can model social groups or voting
or things like that
using very similar ideas
to statistical mechanics
and other ideas that
came about in the 1800s.
So there should be and is
a close cross-pollination
between different disciplines.
There's a whole department
at my university,
Johns Hopkins, called
Biophysics, because physicists
and biologists working together
is an incredibly useful endeavor.
Having said that, that doesn't mean
that all ideas in physics
are useful to biologists,
and in particular, the
ideas of the Higgs boson
or the mass of the top quark
or spontaneous symmetry breaking
in the strong interactions.
These are not that
interesting to biologists
and they don't need to be.
They're specific ideas.
They're not general techniques.
The closest I could come
to saying, how useful is it
for a biologist to know a
little bit about the core theory
of physics is kind of in a negative sense.
There are things you
might plausibly imagine
could be important to
biology, but the physicist
can come along and say,
no, that can't work.
It violates the laws of physics.
I'm thinking of something
like bending a spoon
with my mind, right?
You know, we could imagine
that I have the powers of telekinesis.
I can use what's going on in my mind,
which after all, the
brain is very complicated.
We don't really understand
a lot about how it works.
Maybe it's possible that it
could give rise to some force
that could push things around
without me touching it.
The laws of physics are here
to tell you that's not going
to happen, because we only
have a few ingredients.
We have gravity, we have
electromagnetism and so on.
We know certain limits
on what is possible.
If you're an engineer,
you might be a very,
very clever engineer.
You're not gonna design a rocket ship
that can travel faster
than the speed of light.
You're not gonna build an engine that runs
with no fuel input or
energy input forever.
You're not gonna build a
perpetual motion machine.
You're not gonna violate
the rules of conservation
of electric charge and things like that.
So sadly, physics puts
limits on what we can do
that are a little bit more
narrow than what we can imagine,
but also it suggests new ideas for things
that might be possible,
and those can lead to some big surprises.
By the middle of the 20th century,
physics was in a funny kind of place
because we had the idea
of quantum mechanics.
We even had the ideas
of quantum field theory.
It was in the 1940s, early '50s
that people like Richard
Feynman, Julian Schwinger,
Shin'ichirō Tomonaga, figured
out how to tame the problems
that quantum field theory seemed to have.
When people first invented
quantum field theory,
it gave nonsense answers
for very simple questions
like what is the probability
the two electrons bump into each other?
So Feynman and his friends
figured out how to fix that,
but it was really only
for electromagnetism.
That was the one force of
nature that we really understood
at the quantum level.
We knew there were other forces.
We didn't know about quarks,
but we knew that protons
and neutrons were kept together
inside the nucleus of an atom.
And in fact, we had hints
that there was something
called the strong nuclear force
and the weak nuclear force.
So what were they?
Well, an obvious thing the
do is to say if electricity
and magnetism works so well,
let's just generalize the
idea underlying electricity
and magnetism, which is
something called gauge symmetry,
symmetry of rotating
fields into each other
at different points in space and time.
So this is what Yang and Mills did.
They said, we can go from
electromagnetism, a la Maxwell,
to a whole bunch of
other kinds of theories
that are different, but similar.
Maybe one of them describes
the nuclear forces.
The problem was in
electromagnetism, the existence
of that symmetry predicts
something very noticeable,
namely, the photon has zero mass.
It's a massless particle.
Being a massless particle
means the force associated
with that particle extends
very far throughout space.
And indeed the two massless
particles we know about
are the photon of electromagnetism
and the graviton of gravity,
both of which give rise
to long range forces.
But the nuclear forces are not long range.
They're confined to very short
distances inside the nucleus.
So other people said, well,
it can't be a similar gauge
principle like electromagnetism,
has to be something different.
It turns out that indeed
both the weak nuclear force
and the strong nuclear force
are due to gauge symmetries
much like electromagnetism,
but nature hides them from
us in very clever ways.
And I like to say this is
because the universe loves us,
and the reason why the universe loves us
is because it uses every
possible trick in its book
to construct the standard
model of particle physics
to make it the most rewarding
it can be when physicists figure it out
and when graduate students
have to solve those problems.
So basically, if you want
these massless particles
to not give rise to long range forces,
there's two different ways to do it.
One way is made use of by
the strong interactions,
and the other way is made use
of by the weak interactions.
And the strong interactions is the gluons
that are carrying the
strong nuclear force.
They are massless particles,
but they don't stretch out to infinity
because they keep bumping into each other.
The strong nuclear force is a
strongly interacting theory,
so the gluons just zoom around in circles,
bumping into each other inside
the protons and neutrons,
and you can't pull them apart.
That is why that force is short range.
For the weak nuclear force,
it's the Higgs boson
that is doing the work.
The Higgs boson fills all of space
and basically confines
the weak nuclear force
by absorbing it.
The lines of force from the W
and Z bosons, which would want
to stretch out to infinity,
get eaten up by the Higgs
field that is all around them.
So basically, nature uses every
trick that it can think of
to make physics work in interesting ways,
and it really does give physicists a sense
of accomplishment at the end of the day
to figure it all out.
Quantum mechanics is weird
because despite the fact
that we're celebrating its
100th anniversary right now,
we still don't understand it.
We use it, we put it to
work with amazing success,
whether it's building
large Hadron Collider
or building like a semiconductor device
in a consumer electronics thing,
quantum mechanics is there,
tested very, very reliable,
but remember, it has this idea
that when you measure
something, it changes the state
of the quantum system you measured,
and you haven't told me what
it means to measure something,
the measurement problem.
So of course the most obvious example
of measuring something
is when I as a conscious
human being actually make
a measurement of something.
So it was perfectly legitimate
and absolutely tempting,
let's say, in the middle
of the 20th century, to wonder
out loud, does this mean
that consciousness plays an important role
in the fundamental laws of physics?
Now, all I can tell you
is I don't think so.
I think very much the other way.
I think the consciousness arises out
of the ordinary interplay
of all the complicated things going on
according to the laws of physics.
But there is a school of thought
that says actually
consciousness is responsible
for the collapse of the wave
function in quantum mechanics,
or maybe I shouldn't even
think about wave functions
as real things.
I should think about
agents making measurements
as the real things,
and I use quantum mechanics
as a tool to predict
what their measurement outcomes will be.
So on the one hand, I have my
opinions about what the answer
to these questions are,
but on the other hand,
even more importantly,
I think we don't spend enough time
and spend enough brain power
addressing these questions.
We've kind of swept them under the rug.
There's this whole field
called the foundations
of quantum mechanics.
What is really going on in this our best,
most important framework for
doing fundamental physics?
And I like to sort of semi joke
that if you were to tell
somebody who didn't know anything
about it, oh yeah,
we have this wonderful
theory of the world,
but there's a part of it
which we don't understand,
we're still struggling with that.
They would think, oh, it must
be that trying to understand
that stuff is the single most
important goal in physics.
That the people who are specializing it
are the glamour scientists
who are stolen away
by the best universities with
huge salaries and so forth,
whereas the reality is the opposite.
If this is your specialty in
physics, you'll find it very,
very difficult to get a job.
Most physics departments don't want
to think about the foundations
of quantum mechanics
because they can't figure
out a way to make progress
by doing experiments.
So I'm glad that people have crazy ideas
about the foundations
of quantum mechanics,
even if those crazy ideas
somehow bring consciousness
into the mix.
I don't think that's
ultimately the way to go,
but we're not gonna figure it out
unless a lot of smart people put a lot
of effort into doing so.
I've said before that the
late 19th century physicist
would be forgiven for thinking
that they were almost done.
They almost had it
completely under control.
By the way, very few people actually did.
You can find one or two quotes
from physicists of the era,
but most physicists
are a little bit more cautious than that.
In fact, some were very explicitly saying,
no, no, no, we're not.
We're not done yet.
Hang in there.
It's happening again, right?
Now, over 100 years later,
we're in a situation
where we have a theory,
the standard model plus general relativity
that fits all the data that we have,
but we know it's not the final answer.
You'll find zero physicists today saying
that we have the complete theory.
They might have different
opinions about how close we are
to having the complete theory.
There's several obvious
reasons why we know
we don't have the complete theory.
Dark matter in the universe
is the most obvious experimental result.
Even though we haven't
detected dark matter
in the laboratory, we've
seen its effects in the sky.
We can't fit it into the standard model,
so that's evidence that
we can't be finished
with particles and fields yet.
On the theoretical side, I
said that we have gravity
and we have the standard
model of particle physics,
but we only understand quantum gravity
in a very limited regime
where the gravitational
field is relatively weak.
We understand on the basis
of quantum gravity why the
earth moves around the sun
or apples fall from trees,
but we don't understand what happens
when gravity becomes
strong like in a black hole
or near the big bang.
This is the problem of quantum gravity,
and it's experimentally
inaccessible at the present moment.
We know what energy you would need
to have at a particle accelerator in order
to make quantum gravitational
effects become obvious,
and it's way, way, way, way, way bigger
than what we can possibly do here on earth
with present day technology.
There was this moment in the
1980s when there was a lot
of excitement about what
is called string theory,
or super string theory,
and the excitement was entirely warranted
because people made the
relatively bold conjecture
that instead of particles,
you should imagine
that the fundamental units
of matter are little loops of string.
And just follow your nose,
plug that into the rules
of quantum mechanics, see what happens.
And what happens is absolutely amazing.
Number one, you inevitably
predict gravity,
which is important 'cause gravity exists.
Number two, you inevitably have the room
for everything else, for all
of the fermions and bosons
and all these fields that
we see in the universe.
So the idea of a single unified theory
of everything seemed very attainable,
and they were very excited
in the 1980s continuing on in the 1990s.
String theory, as it is called,
is still a very, very promising approach
to unifying everything
we know about physics,
but we have completely
failed in connecting it
with experimental data.
We were hopeful back there in the '80s.
People said, okay, let's
calculate the mass of the electron
according to string theory.
Turns out to be much,
much harder than we ever
anticipated it would be.
And maybe that's because
strength theory is not right.
We don't know.
Maybe it's because nature
is just not being kind
to us this time.
So I think that today, far
fewer physicists would try
to predict how close we are
to the fundamental theory of everything.
I think there needs
to be a fundamental theory of everything
'cause there is the universe.
There is the real world.
The real world does something.
The theory of everything is just the list
of everything the universe does.
And that may or may not be easy
for us human beings to figure out.
The "3 Body Problem" is
this fun TV show based
on these wonderful novels by Cixin Liu,
and there's a lot of interesting
ideas that are related
to physics and cosmology that come up.
I'm not gonna give you any
spoilers or anything like that,
but I've consulted on various TV shows
and Hollywood films and things like that,
and people always want to know
how realistic the physics is.
And I say, you know, most often,
like the unrealistic physics
is that the star wakes up
after sleeping in their bed
and their pajamas are not wrinkled.
Like that is completely
incompatible with laws of physics
as I understand them.
But it's this process of doing science
that is really unrealistic
in a lot of shows,
and the "3 Body Problem" is no different.
A big plot point in the show
is that scientists have discovered
that there are data coming
in that are incompatible
with their theories and they sort of panic
and they don't like it
and you know, they commit suicide
or they quit physics or whatever.
This is exactly the opposite
of what would happen in the real world.
There's nothing better in
physics than when your theory
is incompatible with a new piece of data,
especially a theory
that has been working very,
very well for a long time.
Now, if you are individually
the person who came up
with the theory, you might be sad.
But as a community, that's
how you make progress.
If you want to win the
Nobel Prize in physics,
you don't show that Einstein was right.
You show that Einstein was wrong.
That's the way to get people excited.
And for whatever reason, right
now, we're in a situation
where in fundamental physics,
in cosmology, gravity,
particle physics, our
theories are almost too good.
Our theories are fitting the
data really, really well.
It's very different than
the situation 100 years ago
when we were chasing all of these new,
surprising experimental results.
That's when you can come
up with better ideas.
The space of possible theories
of physics is way too big
to just guess the right answer.
We need guidance from experiments,
and the kind of guidance we
need is unexpected results.
So the only way to do
that is to build bigger
and better experiments,
and that's what we're trying
very hard to do right now.
It's an almost inevitable
temptation to think
that when we build better computers,
whether it's literally quantum computers
or just much more effective
artificial intelligence algorithms,
that that will help us doing physics,
that that will give us new ideas,
maybe new input from somewhere.
I'm on the one hand super
optimistic about the usefulness
of quantum computers and
AI as tools in physics,
and at the same time,
pretty darn skeptical
that it will lead to new
conceptual breakthroughs.
What computers are really good at doing
is solving well-posed problems.
So in mathematics, for
example, if you have a theorem
and you want to prove the
theorem, this is a lot
of what mathematicians do, prove theorems,
I have no trouble imagining that computers
are gonna start becoming
better at proving theorems
than human beings are.
Computers are better at playing chess
and go than human beings are.
Proving theorems is kind
of in the same direction.
But doing math is so much more than that
because doing math involves asking
the questions in the first place.
Like, what if I put this thing
together with that thing?
And physics is very similar.
What if I think about
this particular system
in a completely new way?
They're not well-defined problems,
and those are the areas where
computers are not as good.
Maybe they will get there.
I have no doubt that in
principle, a computer
can be just as good as a human being.
But because we human beings
don't even understand
what's going on when we
make these creative leaps
it's hard for us to train
the computers to do it.
So in my lifetime anyway, I don't think
that my job is in danger
of being put out of work
by the computer revolution.
There's so many questions
that are easy to ask
and hard to answer.
You know, people ask me
on my podcast, you know,
if you just be having one
physics result from the future
told you, what would it be?
Well, I wanna know the
theory of everything, right?
Like, is that cheating?
Is that not giving an unfair answer?
I wanna know everything.
But if you wanna narrow
it down to like one aspect
of everything that we
better to understand,
I wanna understand how to
reconcile quantum mechanics
with gravity, right?
I wanna understand
what quantum mechanics
itself actually says
and how gravity emerges from that.
I have some ideas about it.
We're working on it, you
know, in our day jobs,
but I suspect that there's something deep
that we haven't yet guessed at yet,
and that's gonna be related to a bunch
of other questions like, what
happened at the Big Bang?
What happens inside Black Holes?
There's many other
questions you could ask,
but that's one group of questions
that everyone recognizes
is really important.
We're all thinking about it very hard,
but we don't know the final answers yet.
