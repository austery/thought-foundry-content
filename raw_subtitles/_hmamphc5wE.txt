Hey,
 it's
 Rachel.
 This
 week,
 we're


revisiting
 some
 of
 our
 favorite
 shows


from
 the
 year,
 listening
 back,
 and


hearing
 what's
 happened
 in
 the
 time


since
 then.


Today,
 we
 return
 to
 the
 story
 of
 one


married
 couple's
 experience
 with
 GLP-1


drugs
 and
 how
 the
 use
 of
 weight
 loss


medications
 like
 Ompic
 can
 impact
 how


people
 see
 themselves
 and
 their
 closest


relationships.


It's
 Friday,
 December
 26th.


Lisa,
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 an


understatement
 to
 say
 that
 we
 in
 2025


are
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 this
 what
 feels


like
 kind
 of
 a
 weight
 loss
 revolution
 in


the
 United
 States.
 And
 of
 course,
 we're


talking
 about
 these
 drugs
 that


everybody's
 probably
 heard
 of.
 Ompici


Monaro.


I
 think
 most
 people
 know
 somebody
 who's


been
 transformed
 by
 them.
 Maybe
 a
 lot
 of


people
 themselves
 have
 actually
 had
 some


experience
 with
 them.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 a
 revolution
 in
 how
 we
 look.


It's
 a
 revolution
 in
 our
 health.
 It's


got
 gigantic
 potential
 to
 help
 people


who
 have
 not
 been
 able
 to
 be
 helped


before.
 The
 data
 show
 that
 one
 in
 eight


Americans


>> has
 tried
 one
 of
 these
 drugs.
 Like
 I


have
 a
 friend
 who
 takes
 the
 medicine
 and


he
 says,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 are
 able
 to


eat
 just
 five
 French
 fries


>> and
 you
 used
 to
 not
 be
 able
 to
 eat
 just


five
 French
 fries,
 it
 gives
 you


grounding
 in
 the
 idea
 that
 you
 can


control


things
 in
 your
 life
 that
 you
 didn't


think
 you
 could
 control.


>> So
 what
 else
 can
 you
 control?


>> [music]


>> Can
 you
 control


the
 way
 you
 relate
 [music]
 to
 your


children,
 the
 way
 you
 talk
 to
 your
 boss?


And
 what
 really
 interested
 [music]
 me


was
 this
 question
 of
 how
 the
 GLP1
 drugs


affected
 a
 marriage,
 especially
 when
 one


partner
 is
 on
 the
 drugs
 and
 [music]
 the


other
 partner
 isn't.


How
 did
 you
 go
 about
 trying
 to
 find
 the


right
 people
 to
 talk
 to
 to
 to
 satisfy


that
 question?
 Right.
 Well,
 we
 at
 the


times
 have
 a
 thing
 called
 a
 call
 out


where
 you
 ask
 the
 public
 a
 question


>> and
 then
 we
 get
 responses
 to
 that


question
 and
 the
 question
 was
 this.
 Has


a
 GLP-1
 drug
 like
 Ompic
 and
 subsequent


weight
 loss
 changed
 your
 relationship?


Um,
 and
 I
 was
 getting
 all
 of
 these


responses
 and
 one
 jumped
 out
 at
 me.
 He


wrote,
 "I
 believe
 it
 has
 changed
 a
 few


things.
 Less
 alcohol
 consumption,


smaller
 meal
 portions,
 improved
 health


outcomes,
 but
 I
 believe
 GLP1
 has


affected
 my
 wife's
 libido,
 no
 interest


in
 sex,


>> perhaps
 due
 in
 part
 to
 image
 issues,


also
 increased
 mood
 swings
 on
 her
 part."


And
 I
 thought,
 there's
 a
 lot
 between
 the


lines
 here.
 And
 so
 I
 called
 them
 up
 and


they
 agreed
 to
 participate
 in
 the
 story


as
 long
 as
 I
 used
 their
 middle
 names.


>> Javier.


>> Javier.
 So
 he
 is
 Javier
 and
 she
 is
 Jean.


>> J
 E
 A
 N
 E.


>> They
 live
 in
 New
 England
 in
 sort
 of
 a


nice
 suburb.


>> We
 celebrated
 our
 anniversary
 a
 few
 days


ago.


>> They
 had
 been
 married
 for
 15
 years.
 And


I
 think
 maybe
 it's
 helpful
 to
 talk
 first


about
 what
 their
 relationship
 was
 like


before
 the
 drugs.
 And
 it
 goes
 back
 to


high
 school.


>> Junior
 year
 is
 when
 I
 met
 her.
 So
 that


takes
 us
 to
 1987.


>> They
 both
 grew
 up
 in
 Sacramento.


>> What
 did
 you
 notice
 about
 her?
 Like
 what


what
 made
 you
 like
 her?


>> Her
 personality.
 Very
 outgoing,
 great


smile.


>> Well,
 I
 I
 thought
 he
 was
 cute.
 Um,


>> but
 she
 was
 like
 in
 a
 bigger
 body
 and


excruciatingly
 self-conscious
 about


that.


>> So,
 always
 felt
 awful,
 never
 felt


attractive.


>> And
 he
 had
 a
 crush
 on
 her.


>> You
 know,
 there
 have
 been
 times
 in
 my


life
 where,
 you
 know,
 someone
 was


actually
 flirting
 with
 me
 or
 trying
 to


you
 come
 on
 to
 me
 and
 I
 I
 just
 don't


register
 the
 signs
 because
 I
 feel
 so


uncomfortable
 in
 my
 own
 body.


So
 even
 though
 she
 had
 a
 crush
 on
 him


too,
 she
 wouldn't
 believe
 [music]
 it.


They
 were
 unrequited
 high
 school


sweethearts


and
 they
 each
 [music]
 married
 other


people.


>> What
 happened
 was
 that
 um
 my
 first


marriage
 was
 coming
 to
 an
 end.


>> My
 first
 marriage
 had
 just
 ended


>> and
 then


>> our
 20-year
 reunion
 was
 coming
 up
 that


fall


>> and
 I
 told
 her
 that
 it'd
 be
 great
 to


connect
 and
 have
 a
 cup
 of
 coffee.
 They


told
 me
 about
 their
 first
 date.


>> The
 cup
 of
 coffee
 ended
 up
 being
 a


dinner
 and
 some
 beers
 and
 then


>> and
 they
 both
 told
 me
 about
 the
 first


time
 that
 they
 had
 sex.


The
 way
 he
 talked
 about
 it
 was
 just
 as


this
 unbelievably


magical


>> uninhibited


interaction.
 She
 didn't
 say,
 "Don't
 look


at
 me."
 Or,
 "I'm
 ashamed
 at
 this,"
 or,


"The
 other,"
 or, "My
 boobs
 are
 too
 big,"


or, "My
 butt's
 too
 big."


>> There
 was
 never
 any
 talk
 of
 that.
 So,


>> I
 I
 kind
 of
 thought
 that
 she
 was
 happy


in
 her
 body.


>> Mhm.
 And
 other
 women
 that
 you
 [music]


had
 been
 with
 like
 that.


>> And
 I'm
 running
 the
 story
 by
 the
 both
 of


them.
 [music]
 And
 she
 was
 like,
 I
 don't


exactly
 remember
 it
 that
 way.


Now,
 we
 know
 that
 they
 eventually
 get


together,
 right?
 They
 get
 married.


>> Yeah.
 They
 move
 to
 the
 east
 coast
 where


she
 gets
 big
 jobs
 in
 corporations.
 She's


the
 earner.
 You
 get
 the
 sense
 that
 they


fit
 each
 other's
 romantic
 fantasies


and
 they're
 extremely
 sexually
 attracted


to
 each
 other.
 It's
 a
 big
 part
 of
 their


identity
 as
 a
 couple.
 They
 have
 a
 child.


They
 settle
 into
 a
 life
 where
 they
 both


love
 food.
 They
 love
 wine
 and
 they
 get
 a


big
 wine
 fridge
 in
 their
 dining
 room.


>> Living
 the
 dream.


>> Totally.
 They're
 doers,
 you
 know.
 They


like
 to
 embibe
 in
 life.
 But
 throughout


this,
 you
 know,
 Jean
 struggled
 with
 her


weight.


>> I
 was
 obese
 um
 from
 a
 BMI
 perspective


>> after
 she
 had
 her
 baby.
 She
 was
 heavy.


She
 hated
 it.
 She
 had
 postpartum


depression.
 She


could
 not
 lose
 the
 weight.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 she
 would
 say
 she's
 gained
 and
 lost


70
 lbs
 multiple
 times
 in
 her
 life
 and
 it


just
 felt
 like
 an
 endless


struggle
 to
 her.
 Did
 she
 tell
 you
 why


she
 was
 having
 so
 much
 trouble
 keeping


the
 weight
 off?
 She
 talked
 about
 food


noise.


>> Yeah,
 food
 noise
 to
 me
 feels
 like
 a


constant
 need
 to
 eat.
 I
 don't
 feel


hungry.
 I
 don't
 feel
 full,
 so
 I
 don't


have
 those
 physiological
 triggers
 to


know
 when
 to
 eat.


>> And
 the
 feeling
 of
 self-loathing
 that


she
 describes
 of
 not
 being
 able
 to


control
 that,
 like
 it's
 a
 failure
 of


will


>> and
 then
 being
 embarrassed
 about
 the


food
 that
 I
 was
 eating.
 So
 sneaking
 food


when
 I
 was
 home
 by
 myself,
 having
 a
 pint


of
 ice
 cream
 because
 I
 could
 and
 I
 could


hide
 it
 just


>> eventually
 this
 bleeds
 to
 health
 issues.


>> Um
 I
 do
 have
 um
 other
 chronic
 conditions


that
 it
 developed
 over
 time.
 I
 had


non-alcoholic
 fatty
 liver
 disease


>> and
 she
 says
 to
 her
 doctor,
 "How
 about


one
 of
 these
 GLP1
 drugs?"


>> And
 he
 wrote
 the
 script.
 And
 can
 you


just
 remind
 us,
 Lisa,
 how
 do
 these
 drugs


actually
 work?


>> Well,
 it
 they
 work
 by
 reducing
 your


feeling
 of
 being
 hungry.
 And
 because
 of


that,
 people
 lose
 a
 ton
 of
 weight
 really


fast.
 And
 people
 who
 have
 been
 dieting


their
 whole
 lives
 and
 struggling
 with


their
 weight
 are
 able
 to
 keep
 their


weight
 off
 as
 long
 as
 they're
 on
 the


drugs.
 And,
 you
 know,
 she
 starts
 losing


a
 lot
 of
 weight
 really
 fast.
 You
 know,


10
 lbs,
 20
 pounds.
 I
 mean,
 she
 lost
 60


pounds
 inside
 of
 eight
 months.
 And
 then,


you
 know,
 she
 notices
 that
 like
 people


start
 treating
 her
 differently.


>> Well,
 and
 even
 at
 work,


>> you
 know,
 she's
 a
 successful


professional.
 She's
 always
 been
 a


successful
 professional.


>> But
 I
 feel
 like
 the
 marketing
 team
 is


putting
 me
 out
 there
 more.
 Now
 suddenly


at
 work
 she's
 getting
 these
 outward


facing
 opportunities
 where
 she's
 being


put
 forward
 as
 a
 talking
 head
 to
 talk
 to


the
 media
 for
 example


>> in
 a
 way
 that
 she
 hadn't
 been
 before.


>> But
 I
 feel
 like
 there's
 this
 different


perception
 of
 me.
 I'm
 the
 same
 person.


I'm
 just
 60
 [music]
 lbs
 lighter.
 Now,


this
 is
 a
 thing
 that
 others
 have
 said


too
 about
 these
 drugs
 that
 doors
 open


and
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 people
 I
 talked
 to
 for


this
 story
 talk
 about
 the
 opportunities


that
 get
 presented
 to
 them,
 promotions


and
 dates.
 And
 if
 you're
 married,
 it


presents
 a
 whole
 world
 of
 things
 that


you
 have
 to
 suddenly
 start
 figuring
 out


that
 you
 didn't
 anticipate
 at
 all.


[music]


And
 that
 was
 definitely
 true
 for
 Jean


and
 Javier.


[music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Lisa,
 I'm
 so
 curious
 how
 these
 huge


changes
 that
 Gene
 is
 going
 through,
 both


physically
 and
 emotionally
 are
 affecting


her
 relationship
 with
 Javier.
 I
 mean,


one
 of
 the
 first
 things
 that
 happened


was
 that
 she
 totally
 lost
 her
 appetite


for
 alcohol.


>> And
 for
 Jean,
 the
 loss
 of
 appetite
 just


changed


her
 whole
 approach
 to
 having
 fun
 with


her
 husband.
 I
 mean,
 no
 longer
 could


they
 sit
 on
 the
 couch
 and
 unccork
 a


bottle
 of
 wine
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 or


go
 to
 the
 local
 brew
 pub
 and
 try
 out
 the


new
 beer.
 None
 of
 it
 felt
 good
 to
 her


anymore.


>> We
 go
 over
 to
 a
 friend's
 house
 and
 we'll


have
 a
 game
 night
 or
 something
 like


that.
 I
 mean,
 we'll
 still
 go.
 I
 just


won't
 drink.


>> And


that's
 fine.


>> Yeah.
 In
 fact,


>> she
 had
 an
 introverted
 side
 that
 hadn't


been
 able
 to
 express
 herself
 because
 she


was
 so
 busy
 being
 a
 pleaser
 extrovert


cuz
 she
 was
 in
 a
 bigger
 body
 and
 she


wanted
 people
 to
 like
 her.


>> I
 am
 not
 as
 much
 of
 a
 night
 owl
 as
 my


husband
 is.
 And
 I
 like
 to
 read
 my
 Kindle


a
 little
 bit
 before
 I
 go
 to
 sleep
 at


night.
 And


>> once
 she
 was
 in
 a
 smaller
 body,
 she


could
 assert
 herself
 and
 say
 like,


"Actually,
 I
 like
 being
 at
 home."
 But


she's
 also
 telling
 Javier
 she
 doesn't


want
 to
 do
 the
 things
 that
 he
 thought


that
 she
 loved
 and
 that
 they
 loved


together.


>> They
 love
 together,
 right?
 How
 does
 he


respond
 to
 all
 this?
 How
 does
 he


>> He
 does
 not
 like
 it.


>> No,
 no.
 I
 like
 going
 with
 the
 flow.
 I


mean,
 living
 in
 the
 moment
 and
 enjoying,


you
 know,
 whatever's
 going
 on
 the
 in


social
 aspects
 or
 social
 events.
 Yeah.
 I


>> He
 was
 like,
 "No,
 this
 is
 not
 how
 we


are.
 We
 are
 the
 people
 who
 do
 these


things."


>> I
 think
 he
 misses
 his
 drinking
 buddy,


the
 person
 who
 is
 going
 to
 stay
 out


late.
 It
 sounds
 like
 the
 lifestyle
 stuff


led
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 tension,


>> more
 than
 tension.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 they


had
 a
 really,
 really,
 really
 hard
 time.


And
 when
 I
 met
 them,
 they
 were
 fighting


a
 lot.


>> Um,
 before
 it
 was
 a
 conversation
 and
 you


know,
 and
 now
 it's
 a
 fight
 and
 one
 of
 us


is
 going
 to
 walk
 away
 angry
 um
 because


we're
 not
 seeing
 eye
 to
 eye
 on
 something


>> and
 their
 fights
 could
 be
 loud
 and
 ugly.


So
 I
 started
 really
 um
 wondering
 who
 I


was
 with.
 Bottom
 line
 is
 it
 became
 very


confusing
 to
 me
 as
 far
 as
 as
 far
 as
 how


to
 manage
 our
 relationship.
 I
 would
 even


comment
 to
 her
 and
 say,
 you
 know,
 I
 need


I
 don't
 recognize
 you.
 I
 need
 a
 road


map.
 I
 need
 I
 need
 a
 road.


>> One
 of
 the
 biggest
 things
 that
 changed


is
 that
 they
 completely
 stopped
 having


sex.


>> I
 used
 to
 love


feeling
 her
 body,
 her
 big
 body
 next
 to


me
 in
 bed.
 the
 softness
 uh
 of
 her
 body,


you
 know,
 the
 extra
 tummy
 and
 the
 extra


booty,
 you
 know,
 next
 to


>> They
 both
 talk
 about
 the
 loss
 of
 her


butt.


>> Are
 there
 things
 you
 miss
 about
 your


previous
 body?


>> My
 butt.


>> They
 both
 loved
 her
 butt.


>> So,
 I
 I
 miss
 that


that
 voluuptuousness.


Uh
 being
 able
 to
 lean
 up
 next
 to
 her
 and


feel
 her


for
 lack
 of
 a
 better
 word,
 draping
 over


me.
 That's
 no
 longer
 an
 option.
 Now
 it's


it's
 cuddling
 and
 it's
 cuddling
 as
 tight


and
 closely
 as
 we
 can
 or
 as
 I
 can.
 And


that's
 that's
 the
 extent
 of
 the


intimacy.


I
 I'm
 at
 a
 loss
 for
 why
 there's
 no


physical
 intimacy


>> or
 hasn't
 been
 any.
 this
 like
 physical


connection
 [music]
 that
 they
 had
 has


completely


changed
 [music]
 into
 something
 else.
 And


neither
 one
 of
 them
 knows
 exactly


how
 to


find
 it
 again.


>> And
 [music]
 this
 new
 body


I
 haven't
 really
 been
 able
 to
 touch
 or


or
 explore
 or
 anything
 like
 that.


>> It's
 not
 as
 accessible
 to
 you.


>> It's
 not.
 No.


Why
 haven't
 they
 had
 sex?
 Like,
 was
 that


just
 another
 appetite
 that
 the
 drugs


reduced?
 I
 mean,
 that's
 what
 Javier's


theory
 was.
 Is
 maybe


>> Jean
 has
 different
 theories
 of
 the
 case.


She's
 gone
 through
 menopause.


She's
 been
 on
 anti-depressants
 for
 a


really
 long
 time.
 And
 both
 of
 those


things
 are
 known
 to
 suppress
 sex
 drive.


But
 I
 think
 there's
 actually
 something


bigger
 at
 work
 here.


>> I
 haven't
 said
 this
 to
 him.


I
 just
 didn't
 say
 no
 before.
 Mhm.
 So,


>> she
 started
 to
 be
 able
 to
 draw


boundaries
 between
 doing
 things
 for


other
 people
 because
 they
 want
 them
 and


being
 able
 to
 articulate
 what
 she
 wants.


>> I'm
 setting
 the
 boundaries.
 I
 don't
 want


to
 have
 sex,
 but
 before
 I
 would,


>> but
 he
 very
 much
 wants
 to
 be
 her
 loving


partner.


>> Mhm.
 It
 sounds
 like
 the
 drugs
 kind
 of


unearthed
 something.
 They
 unearthed
 some


kind
 of
 dynamic
 in
 their
 sex
 life
 that


Gene
 had
 only
 been
 maybe
 vaguely
 aware


of,
 but
 certainly
 had
 not
 been
 in
 a


position
 to
 act
 on
 before
 she
 felt


differently
 about
 herself.
 Yes,
 I
 think


that's
 true.
 I
 think
 they
 were
 both


completely
 blindsided
 [music]
 by
 that.


>> I
 felt
 that
 we
 were
 always
 on
 the
 same


page
 and
 going
 on,
 you
 know,
 we're
 on


the
 same
 [music]


>> We
 weren't
 two
 ships
 in
 the
 night


crossing
 paths.
 we
 were
 one


>> one
 ship.


>> So
 you're
 empowered
 in
 a
 way
 to
 take
 up


space
 to
 say
 what
 you
 want


and
 that
 forces
 you
 to
 have
 to


figure
 out
 what
 you
 want.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Beyond
 just
 like
 I
 want
 to
 leave
 the


party
 at
 10:00,
 you
 know,
 that's
 in
 a


way
 that's
 easy.
 Like
 do
 I
 want
 to
 have


a
 sexual
 relationship
 with
 my
 husband?


Do
 I
 want
 to
 leave
 my
 corporate
 job?
 Do


I
 wanna
 like
 like
 these
 are
 much
 bigger


questions?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Well,
 and
 kind
 of
 sad
 that


at
 53
 that
 I'm
 starting
 to
 have
 those


thoughts.
 Aren't
 those
 the
 kinds
 of


things
 that
 [music]


most
 people
 think
 about
 when
 they've


graduated
 from
 school?
 Right.
 I
 just
 I'm


the
 good
 girl
 and
 I
 do
 what
 what's


expected.


>> Mhm.
 In
 a
 certain
 body.
 And
 now
 you
 have


a
 different


>> in
 a
 certain
 body.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 still
 feel
 very
 strongly
 that
 this
 is


the
 one
 of
 the
 best
 things
 that
 I've


done
 for
 myself.


This
 is
 it.
 [music]
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 have


lost
 the
 weight
 and
 I
 will

 Lisa
 calls
 Gan


and
 Javier
 back
 to
 see
 how
 they've


handled
 the
 changes
 in
 their


relationship
 since
 the
 episode


originally
 aired.


>> Hi
 guys.
 Hey,
 how's
 it
 going?


>> Can
 you
 hear
 me?


>> We
 can
 hear
 you.


>> So,

 met
 approximately
 a
 year
 ago.


>> Yeah.


>> Tell
 me
 what's
 changed
 between
 you
 since


then.

 not
 a
 virgin
 anymore.
 [laughter]

 mean
 by
 that?
 Are

 Let's
 just
 It's
 no
 longer
 a


dry
 spell.
 Let's
 just
 say
 that.
 That's


amazing.
 Jean,
 what
 prompted
 you?
 What


was
 the
 change
 in
 you?


>> I'd
 had
 a
 mommy
 makeover.
 Um,
 I
 had
 a


tummy
 tuck.
 I
 had
 a
 breast
 reduction
 and


lift.
 I
 had
 the
 arms
 done.
 So,
 removing


loose
 skin.
 So,
 I
 was
 just
 feeling


affectionate
 and
 appreciative.


>> Yeah.
 Out
 of
 the
 blue
 a
 few
 weeks
 ago,


Jean
 said,
 "Hey,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 thank


you
 for
 being
 so
 supportive
 through
 my


my
 adventure
 with
 my
 body
 image
 issues


and
 and
 fears."
 And
 I'm
 thinking,
 "Wow,


okay.
 Well,
 you're
 welcome."
 Like,
 you


know,
 I
 love
 you,
 baby.
 You
 know,
 and


that's
 that
 was
 the
 end
 of
 it.


>> So,
 break
 it
 down
 for
 me.
 Like,
 where


were
 you?
 What
 happened?
 What
 made
 you


in
 the
 mood?


[laughter]


>> Okay.
 No,
 I
 mean
 in
 the
 morning
 and
 at


home,

 said,
 "Hey,

 know,
 we've
 said
 to


the
 effect
 that

 have
 some
 time
 and


I'm
 I'm
 feeling
 I'm
 feeling
 amorous.
 Uh,

 want
 to


>> Yeah,

 think
 I'm

 think
 she
 said


like
 I'm

 open
 to
 it."
 And
 I'm
 like,


"Okay,
 no
 clothes
 are
 coming
 off."


[laughter]


>> I
 don't
 even
 think
 you
 said
 that.
 They


were
 just
