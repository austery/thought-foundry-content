>> Back in February 2025, Tiff
Macklem, governor of the Bank
of Canada, was set to give a
speech.
It was supposed to be about
monetary policy, but then
things changed dramatically.
>> While the new tariffs have
not yet taken effect, the
uncertainty around US trade
policy is already affecting our
economy.
And if the United States starts
a protracted trade war,
the consequences could be
severe.
>> That was almost a year ago.
So what kind of consequences
have we seen, and what's the
overall state of the Canadian
economy?
Then we take a look at
the factors driving Canada's
high youth unemployment rate,
which hit 13.3% in December.
Why is it so hard to find a job
right now?
And what can be done to bring
that number back down?
And finally, this is our first
week taping in our beautiful
new studio.
We take you behind the scenes
to show you how it all
came together and the people
who made it happen.
This is The Rundown.
Even people whose job is
making predictions would
probably have had a hard time
predicting the events of 2025.
We had trade wars,
changing global alliances,
political uncertainty, all
things that have major effects
on the health of a country's
economy.
I wanted to know how Canada's
economy is dealing with all this
and what could lie ahead.
So I sat down for a talk with
Dawn Desjardins, chief economist
at Deloitte Canada.
Dawn, thank you so much for
having us.
Are you doing?
>> I'm good.
How are you?
>> I'm doing well.
I want to
start with a chart of Canadian
economic growth.
Over the past year,
GDP contracted 1.8% in
the second quarter,
then bounced back.
It was up 2.6% in quarter three.
That's the last period
for which we have data.
But the forecast are positive
for Q4 and right through the
year.
Can you tell us what are
the main drivers of this?
We'll call them modest
expansion.
>> Well, in the near term,
I think it's more a question of
what's not really driving us,
and that will be the consumer.
The demographics for Canada
have changed significantly over
the last couple of years.
And so when we think about
what's happening in 2026,
we're going to see
an economy which isn't
getting that talk, if you will,
from that population growth.
And so we think that in the
near term anyway, it's probably
going to be a situation where
you have weak consumption
activity, housing market
activity.
It's a bit mixed depending
where you live.
And so that two on net
will be a bit of a positive.
But again, not super quick.
I think one of the big issues
that we're confronting
as we go through,
at least the first part of our
forecast, is what's happening
on the business front.
I mean, businesses are
extraordinarily uncertain,
and it makes sense because of
what's happening in
the global economy.
So we haven't seen any business
investment.
And that's certainly played out
in 2025.
And we think in the early part
of 2026, that's still going to
be the case.
>> All right.
With that being said,
as you mentioned, net overall,
we expect in 2026 a
growth rate of 1.5%.
Is that an optimistic number
or pessimistic one, considering
the challenges that you sort of
laid out?
>> Well, I think when we look
at that number, it doesn't look
all that hot for the year.
But I think we're looking at it
as a year in two halves,
meaning first half probably
going to be feeling sluggish
and soft.
But as we round out 2026,
we think there's lots of
reasons to believe we're going
to see stronger activity.
First of all, interest rates
we believe will remain low
at 2.25%.
That's much lower than the 5%
of where we saw in mid 2024.
So that will be good.
And it's going to help consumers
and it's going to help
consumers, because we
still have a lot of mortgages
that are going to refinance
this year.
In 2021, when people took
those mortgages, the rates
were really low.
Now it's not as low,
but it certainly is a lot lower
than what we saw when we had
those high interest rates.
So that's going to provide
some relief.
And remember, we've had lots of
employment growth over the past
few years.
We've had lots of wage growth.
So that's going to help
those consumers navigate
through this period.
The other and I hope this
isn't a hopeful prediction,
but we do have the Kuzma review
excuse me in July.
And there what we're consuming.
And again this is a pretty big
assumption for our forecast is
that we will retain our access
to the US market basically
tariff free.
Now it doesn't necessarily imply
that lumber, steel,
and aluminium finished autos
may not see a lot of
change there.
So we baked that in.
Not a lot of change.
That means that those parts of
the economy will remain pretty
weak.
But the other parts of
the economy where we can
actually export to the United
States tariff free, and that
can be up to 90, 95% of our
exports.
Those are really going
to be areas where conceivably
we might even have an advantage,
because they're lower rate than
other countries.
>> In 2025, we saw a number of
headlines with the federal
government in regards to
spending a lot of spending,
a lot of infrastructure.
How much of the growth in 2025
and 2026 is a result of
the additional
spending by the federal
government?
>> Yeah, 2025, some of it
because we did see a
significant increase in the
defence side, mainly through
wages and salaries.
So that did give a bit of
a lift.
And as we go through
the course of this year,
you know, we're going to
continue to see some spending
now.
Is it going to be an
enormous lift.
Probably not because all
of these are big ticket items
and it takes a while for
that money to flow through.
But having said that,
on the margin definitely going
to be the case.
We think that the the investment
side of government spending,
not so much the consumption
side, because we know
there's going to be a lot of
cuts to government workforce,
for example.
So we say that we will
get a lift in 2026 from the
government investment side.
The other thing I guess I'd say
is we're going to have a lot of
other changes in policy that we
think will be helpful for
businesses who are looking to
invest.
>> Like what?
>> Well, we're going to see and
I mean, again, this is what our
assumptions are elimination or
at least a reduction in
inter-provincial trade barriers.
So that opens up for a lot of
companies across the country,
which is really quite amazing.
We also think we're going to
see some reduction in some of
the regulation.
You know, when we look at
companies who are starting to
invest, they're looking at
big delays, lots of regulations,
lots of red tape.
Well, to the extent that we
have a commitment from
governments that they will
reduce this, we think that's
going to alleviate some
pressure from the business side
as well.
So while it's not
direct government spending per
se, the alleviation of some of
these, these real impediments,
I think that's going to be good
for the business side.
>> Staying on the spending side,
the federal financial support
is contributing to a federal
deficit of $78 billion this
year.
There's a lot of risk
that some would say economic
risk that come with government
spending this much money.
When we talk about a year of
lots of uncertainty,
do you take that that notion
that this is risky?
>> Not really.
And the reason is because when
we look at things like this,
debt service costs as a
percentage of our revenues.
So nationally, you know,
we have debt and we have
deficits which are adding to
that debt.
But we also have rates
that are lower.
And so when we think about,
okay, how much does it cost
taxpayers to actually finance
to pay the interest
on that debt.
So right now it's about
$0.10 on a dollar of revenue.
Now why does that sound okay.
Because in the mid '90s
that was $0.38.
So you know we have done
a lot of the hard work fiscally
in the past.
Now we're looking at an
investment in our future.
And so that's why I would
say yeah those numbers are big.
And they sound a bit scary
given the current environment.
But I do think that we need to
do these things.
We need to invest in
our infrastructure.
We need to help companies
in terms of, you know,
being able to put their
money to work and feel that
they are going to get a return
on those investment.
That's not going to take them
decades.
>> Okay.
I'm going to go back a
little bit in time, not as far
as you have, but the government
has embarked on big spending
twice recently.
Pandemic don't have to look far.
And now when we talk about our
trade relationship with the US,
in the case of the pandemic,
though, inflation rose.
Tell me why you do not expect
that to be the case
as the government
embarks on higher spending this
time around.
>> What were they spending on?
Well, they were having to spend
on supporting people.
And we also had a situation
where we had, you know,
as we came out
of the pandemic, we had huge
demand, but we had no workers.
And so companies had to pay up.
So we saw wages rise
significantly and as a result,
that fuelled an increase in
prices.
So that is the type of
spending it was.
Now when we look to what's
happening in the future,
these are investment dollars
and none of this is
going to happen quickly.
That is one of the things,
you know, if we think about
building a pipeline,
building a port, that isn't
going to happen very quickly.
So it's a gradual increase
in spending.
So it's spending in a
different way.
I guess the other thing to think
about is our supply chains and
their so far we haven't seen a
significant spike in cost,
which, you know, Canadian
companies are going to have to
pass on to consumers.
A lot of that again,
reflects this idea
that we are getting, you know,
our goods to the US.
So when we're importing them,
we're not necessarily seeing
that high, higher cost
on our supply chains.
>> I want to talk again about
interest rates a little bit.
You don't think it's going to
move at all from 2.25 for the
rest of the year, but these are
important, as you mentioned,
and laid out for a lot of
people with housing market,
people who are looking to enter
into the market, people who are
looking at renewing.
But as you know, the market
is softening in Canada.
When we talk about housing,
what are the main factors
that are pressuring house prices
right now across the country?
>> Well, markets like Toronto
as an example, you know,
there's a lot of supply out
there.
>> In terms of.
>> Towers, a bunch of condo
towers.
And those were a lot of
investors were putting money in
there.
And we haven't seen that
that flow continue.
So we have seen a softening.
Additionally, when we think
about overall conditions
in the housing market,
a lot of affordability issues
came up, right.
We had seen prices move so
significantly, especially
during the pandemic, and so
affordability pressures built
up.
Now, are they in a situation
now where things are
much more affordable?
Well, perhaps in some markets,
sure, but not in all markets.
And so yes, we've got price
corrections that have happened.
We have lower interest rates.
Those are, you know, good for
affordability.
But at this stage we also
have that uncertainty quotient.
And so consumers are like
we're really nervous.
You look at consumer confidence
metrics.
They're you know they're
nervous.
So are they going to really
put a lot of money down
to buy a home at this stage.
Not necessarily.
Don't think this will persist.
I mean, I think when we're
looking at our forecast and
looking at events that could
change consumer and business
confidence, it really is.
I think we're heading into that
period, that inflection point
where we're going to have some
more clarity on this
relationship.
It could be, you know,
optimistic thinking, but
and I don't think the agreement
necessarily going to look
exactly the same.
But in the main, it is going
to be that we will have access
to our largest trading partner.
And that will allay a lot of
these concerns that both
businesses and consumers have.
>> Let's talk jobs.
At this moment of our
conversation right now, we
don't, unfortunately, have the
Canadian job data for December,
but we know that from September
to November, Canada added
just under 200, 180,000 jobs.
What kind of jobs are these?
Help us understand the
demographics here.
>> Well, generally, I mean, we
have seen some improvement in
those industries that were very
badly hit now, temporary, I
think, but nonetheless, it did
show.
But they're at much lower
levels.
So in the manufacturing
sector, for example, jobs tend
to be created on the services
side of the equation.
But as we look going forward,
what we're hearing from
companies is that they're
not looking to cut their
workforce because a few
things.
One is that they know
the demographics aren't going
to be working for them, so we
won't be having as many people
come into the labour force.
But at the same time,
they're not looking to
necessarily add.
And that's what I think is
keeping a consumers a little
off balance.
So when we're looking
at the labour market, it does
seem to be soft.
We look at the vacancy rate.
So how many jobs are out there
for unemployed workers.
That's come down considerably.
As you may recall,
during the post pandemic,
millions of jobs that were out
there, that's no longer the
case.
So the labour market does
show some signs of being soft
because businesses are nervous.
And so they're not really
investing in getting new
workers.
Now, if we are correct
in our assumption about how
businesses are going to be
feeling as we even as we exit
2026, that suggests to us that
we will start to see some
employment gains, but we're
probably going to have to sit
tight with this soft labour
market at least until mid-year.
>> When we talked about some of
these big projects.
You know, we talk about
pipelines, we talk about you
need skilled labour for that.
We have a bit of a shortage
in this country.
Is that playing?
Is that a concern at all?
>> Oh it is.
We did a analysis recently
saying, okay, what if everything
goes according to plan.
We have more houses built.
We have all these projects get
underway.
What does that mean?
What's what do we need to
execute on that?
And what we determined
is that we probably
need half a million more
skilled workers.
And so that's a challenge.
And so with all of
these big government programs,
we agree that this is all
necessary to put us into a
stronger growth trajectory.
But we have to consider
that there is risk on
the execution side.
We need to get these workers
into Canada.
Do we have to tap underutilised
groups in the economy?
Sure, that could work.
But we also have to consider
that we may have to see
immigration rise.
>> Time as well, that it takes
time to train a skilled trades
workers.
Yeah.
Compare to other provinces in
terms of expected employment
rates in 2026?
>> Well, Ontario, unfortunately,
is sort of in the eye of the
storm.
You know, we're the
manufacturing hub.
So we are seeing a lot of
pressure.
And as I said, we haven't
made any big assumptions
about removal
or at least reduction in the
tariffs on the auto side as
well as steel and aluminium.
So that does suggest that
Ontario is going to be
continuing to lag.
And when we look at where,
you know, where do we send our
exports south of the border.
So yes, there's some things that
are going to be business as
usual, but others are going to
continue to lag.
Now, I guess the big fear,
and this isn't something
that we've seen so far,
is that it ripples out
into the services side of
the economy.
You know, when you see
certain communities losing a
lot of workers, what does that
look like in terms of any kind
of services they may be using?
Now?
We haven't seen that evidence
of that yet.
So it is something, though,
that we have to be mindful of
and keep on the risk side
of the equation.
But Ontario overall, I would
say, you know, we're looking
for more modest growth than the
national average as we go
through 2026.
>> All right.
Let's talk about the money that
is or isn't in our pockets.
You point out that consumer
spending contracted in quarter
three of 2025, which is rare
outside of a recession.
Does that mean that personal
saving rates is up?
And or is it that people
are simply tapped out?
>> We had seen huge savings, of
course, during the pandemic,
and they've come down and they
have come down again.
I think when we're looking at
what people are spending on,
you know, they're having to
make these higher payments
in terms of their mortgages.
So that's certainly taking
some of it away.
We're probably not going
to see as rapid wage growth
as we move forward.
So again, it means
that people are going to
be able to, we believe, service
their mortgages because again
that gap is come down.
So that's good.
And we're not looking for
big job losses.
So again that's good.
But at the same time you know
when you do have more going
towards paying for your
mortgage, for example,
that does suggest that the
savings rates are not
necessarily going to rise
significantly.
Doesn't mean we're going to
zero by any stretch,
but it does suggest
that it's not going to see the
lofty levels we had been seeing.
>> I want to talk Canadian
dollar.
I feel like we don't talk
about it that much these days,
because it's been hanging
around at a point that I think
a lot of Canadians would love
to see a bit higher.
What do you expect
the Canadian dollar to be
at the end of 2026?
>> Well, our forecast right now
is for about 74.5 cents.
So that's $0.02 firmer
than where we are today.
And it reflects a view
that we keep the Bank of
Canada rate steady.
Whereas in the US the Federal
Reserve does actually lower
their policy rate.
I mean, the US economy has been
extraordinarily resilient.
It's amazing how well they've
done lots of investment,
of course, in artificial
intelligence and technology.
And that really has bolstered
the US economy.
But what we're seeing right now,
I think, is evidence that the
labour market in the US is
softening a bit.
We're seeing measures of
confidence from the consumer
side certainly soften.
I mean, the US economy is a
little bit different in terms
of the consumer, because you
see lots of spending from the
very wealthy component and lots
of people who aren't really
that affluent, really having a
difficult time with their
spending.
So when the fed looks at these
things and they're not seeing
inflation in the US is
kind of steady, it's higher
than they want, but it's kind
of steady.
So I think from the Fed's
perspective they're now
looking at the labour market.
It's going it's a little soft.
And when we know that a large
portion of the population
aren't doing as well as the
people who are have lots of big
investment portfolios, for
example, that probably means
they're going to need to
address that through lower
interest rates.
Now, that doesn't mean
they're going to move a lot,
I don't think, in 2026,
but it will be sufficient
that it'll kind of bend that
curve in favour of the Canadian
dollar.
>> Talked about AI.
Talk to me about what we see
for AI in Canada.
Here lots of we have an
AI minister federally.
There's lots of investment
there.
What can we see from that?
>> Well, the one thing about AI
in Canada is when you look at
sort of the adoption rates by
Canadian businesses, it has
it's doubled.
It's gone from 6 to 12,
which is good.
And Statistics Canada
did a survey asking
Canadian businesses.
And that number I think is
supposed to go up to 17, 18%.
So that's good over the next
12 months.
So that means that, you know,
we can see more adoption and
then how that translates into
productivity gains in the
delivery of goods and services.
It's you know, it'll be
interesting.
We do believe that
this will generate.
Well, it's more how exactly
is it going to play out.
What's it going to mean.
We don't necessarily mean
think that we're going to see
huge job losses.
And we're not seeing
that yet in the data either,
really, because it's a
tool to augment workers ability
to produce goods and services.
You know, one thing that I find
always, like in such an
interesting statistic is
looking at how much a US
company invests per worker and
compare that to a Canadian
company.
And here the numbers
are really staggering.
For each dollar,
the US company invests
tools giving to their workers
$0.52 here in Canada.
So to the extent that
Canadian businesses
are going to invest in AI are
going, I think that's going to
be a good productivity lift
because we need to provide our
workers with the best tools and
the best technology we can.
>> One last quick question for
you, because I don't think we
ask Chief Economist, is that
this that often?
What are you looking forward
to in 2026?
>> What am I looking forward to?
You know what, I'm looking
forward to that moment where
we are seeing optimism, because
we're all a little bit tired of
hearing, oh, it's uncertain.
And oh my goodness, I don't
know what's going on.
I do think that we are sort of
at that point where lots of
things are happening.
They're happening,
but the blocks are building.
We just need to get to that
level where we can
start to see.
So I think for me,
and I'll be watching this
keenly, is just seeing that
turn in terms of business
sentiment.
>> Don, we're going to leave it
there.
Thank you so much.
Really appreciate it.
Thank you.
If you know someone aged 15 to
24 or are somewhat between 15
and 24, you probably know the
job market is pretty grim.
Why is it so hard
for young people to get hired
in this country right now?
Unravels a deep Dixit breaks
down the causes and effects
of Canada's high youth
unemployment rate.
>> It drives me nuts when I see
young, healthy people and
they'll call me up saying
I can't find a job.
I can assure you,
if you look hard enough,
you'll find a job.
>> That's easier said than done,
because it's hard to find work
in a sluggish economy.
And if you're one of
those young people
between 15 and 24 struggling
to land a job,
you're far from alone.
Over the last year, the youth
unemployment rate has stayed
above 10%.
That's nearly double
the unemployment rate of every
other age group in the country.
And this isn't just a short
term problem beyond needing to
afford to live, not finding
work at the start of your
career can have long lasting
effects.
You're more likely to miss
out on building skills,
growing professional networks,
and moving up early in your
career.
>> You got this, bro.
Move up.
>> And even when young people
do find work in a depressed
economy, it's often at a lower
salary.
Research shows entering
the workforce during periods
like this can reduce annual
earnings up to 9%, losses that
can take as long as a decade to
recover.
So how do we end up with
such high youth unemployment?
It's the result of several
overlapping pressures.
Economic uncertainty
and trade tensions have made
businesses slower to hire, and
when jobs are available, young
workers are often competing
with more experienced employees
who may have lost theirs.
At the same time, the number of
entry level positions has
declined, a shift that many
economists linked to automation
and AI.
High immigration levels over
the past several years have
also increased competition
for those entry level jobs,
even as immigration continues
to support overall economic
growth.
We've seen youth unemployment
reach similar levels before.
During the pandemic, after
the 2009 financial crisis,
and in the mid '90s, all
periods of economic recession.
Even though Canada isn't
technically in one right now.
So how do we get out of
this?
Some of it depends on policy,
and that process has already
started.
The federal government has
reduced immigration targets.
The Bank of Canada has
lowered interest rates,
and domestic spending
has picked up in sectors like
travel, restaurants and live
entertainment industries, where
young people often find work.
But these measures take time.
It's not going to happen
overnight.
In the meantime, young people
are being asked to navigate
a weak job market and absorb
the long term consequences
of an economy they didn't
create.
>> I love our new couch, our
new floor, and our new floor to
ceiling bookcase.
I appreciate so much about this
new studio, including the people
who put it together.
Here's a look at what it took
to build this beautiful space.
>> Sir.
>> All right, so you probably
noticed we are in a different
setting.
We've changed studios a couple
of times.
This is the location for our
cold open.
So every episode we start off
here right in my office.
We've got our books,
we've got our camera operator
there, Ricardo.
And we introduce our topics
and our headlines for the day.
And we're still filming
in a boardroom upstairs
as our main studio.
But we're hoping in the
next couple of weeks that our
studio on the main floor will
be done and that will be our
new home.
>> And then this guy goes on
top and then.
So we should have two of these.
My name is Kathleen Black
and I'm the senior set prop
and wardrobe designer at TVO.
And I'm the production designer
on The Rundown.
So I started designing sets.
As in theatre, this is very
different.
Usually when you think of
broadcast, you think big,
shiny, new set.
And in this case,
I sort of thought about
our host Jeyan and thought
if we were in Jeyan's living
room, what would it look like?
And that started to pique
my imagination of what the tone
of the set would be within our
studio.
We needed to make room
for The Rundown as well as a
podcast space.
Because we have a lot of
video podcasts.
We of course have
Big, if True, which
is another one of our broadcast
shows, and then we also have a
green screen in our studio,
which is where kids and TVO
learn often shoots.
So we had to have a way
to sort of mask that
when we don't want to see it.
Some of the key features are
acoustic panelling.
We didn't want to apologise that
we're a studio, so we actually
used them as a design feature.
We have a big, beautiful
bookshelf, a bit of a window
feature and a single monitor
which will look like a piece of
art most times, and then you're
going back and forth with the
producers as well as your
lighting designer and your
construction team.
I love going to the shelf
because things are getting done.
It is busy.
There's sawdust flying, and it
means that set pieces are
coming to life.
>> I'm Polly-Jean Vernon, I'm
the construction coordinator
here at TV Ontario.
>> Yes, protected.
>> You know what I mean?
And then when and then.
And we'll put it together here.
We're on a very tight
deadline, so we're working
off-site while other people
make the studio ready.
We're doing lots of things at
once.
It's a lot and we're ready.
We're up for it.
>> So when you go in there,
everybody is working.
Everyone has a task to do
and they're often very
different tasks.
There's a paint team,
there's carpentry teams.
>> This is what we're doing.
There's view of The Rundown set
here, window curtain here and
these beautiful studio doors.
Shoutout our designer Kathleen
Black.
She is amazing.
>> So it's sort of like you're
doing a renovation in your
house and you're going from
blank walls to something with
personality and set design is
finding what that personality
is.
>> We want our show to reflect
you and what you care about.
What issues would you like us
to cover?
What makes you tune in?
Let us know!
Feedback or leave us a comment
on YouTube.
Until then, we'll see you
tomorrow.
Coming up on The Rundown.
>> When you have a trauma event,
especially when it's a
repetitive trauma event,
especially when it's from
people who are close to you
caretakers, parents, and so on.
It creates what I call a
cascade event.
You've ignited a whole set
of biological events
that cascade, causing an off
trajectory development of your
brain.
Your brain is literally
different at age 25 when
compared to someone who's 25
who didn't have trauma.
And we can trace it
back to the effect of
the abnormal stress response
created by the trauma that
saved you in the short term.
You see stress, stress
responses, Eric.
They save us
in the near term.
They get us
past the stressor, but they
leave a bit of sort of friendly
fire, so to speak.
>> That's tomorrow
on The Rundown.
